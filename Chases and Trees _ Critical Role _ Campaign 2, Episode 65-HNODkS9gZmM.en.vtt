00:00:00.596 --> 00:00:02.412
MATT: Hello, everyone and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.412 --> 00:00:03.688
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

3
00:00:03.688 --> 00:00:04.840
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

4
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.178
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:06.178 --> 00:00:08.411
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:12.998
MATT: The evolution of that still escapes me.

7
00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:14.923
But yes, welcome. Before we jump into tonight's game,

8
00:00:14.923 --> 00:00:16.511
we do have some announcements to get through.

9
00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:17.623
First and foremost, our fantastic

10
00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:20.663
returning sponsors, two of them for the evening.

11
00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:23.738
First, our friends since the beginning of Campaign Two,

12
00:00:23.738 --> 00:00:25.399
D&amp;D Beyond. Sam.

13
00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:26.794
(cheering)

14
00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:27.859
SAM: Hi, everybody.

15
00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.915
I'm a little-- I'm still a little bit

16
00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:33.071
sort of adjusting in shock tonight.

17
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:35.920
I was-- I had this whole thing planned for D&amp;D Beyond.

18
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.842
I was going to play a character named Timmy

19
00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:42.559
the tiger, the copyright-conscious breakfast tiger.

20
00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:45.987
And I had this whole shtick planned

21
00:00:45.987 --> 00:00:49.151
because, available for the first time digitally

22
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:51.207
on D&amp;D Beyond starting July 4th,

23
00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:54.609
is Hunt for the Thessalhydra.

24
00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.070
Hunt for the Thessalhydra, which is great,

25
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.023
or as Timmy the Tiger would say,

26
00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:02.773
it's grrr-oovy because he's copyright conscious.

27
00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.655
Timmy was also going to tell everyone to join their friends

28
00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:09.594
for this all new short D&amp;D adventure

29
00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:11.563
created with the help of Mike Wheeler

30
00:01:11.563 --> 00:01:15.971
from Stranger Things himself because it's grrr-oundbreaking.

31
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:16.839
Timmy the Tiger--

32
00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:17.923
LAURA: You're so stupid.

33
00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:19.631
SAM: Timmy the Tiger was also going to mention

34
00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:22.255
that D&amp;D Beyond is hiring again.

35
00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:24.867
A variety of open positions can be found on their website

36
00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:27.431
right now. Apply and you can earn yourself

37
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:31.750
some grrr-eenbacks, but I can't do that whole bit

38
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.642
because of a political bombshell

39
00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:38.803
in the campaign for D&amp;D Beyond President has dropped.

40
00:01:38.803 --> 00:01:40.532
For weeks I have been wondering why

41
00:01:40.532 --> 00:01:42.907
the O'Brien-Johnson campaign has been

42
00:01:42.907 --> 00:01:44.295
surging ahead in the polls.

43
00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:48.536
Was it because of Mr. O'Blien's-- Brian's-- O'Blien's.

44
00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:50.836
(laughter)

45
00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:52.399
SAM: O'Blien, that's a great nickname.

46
00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.859
Was it because of his slick fascist campaign video?

47
00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.621
Was it because of Ms. Johnson's libelous insulting roast?

48
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:04.831
Or was it something else, someone else pulling the strings?

49
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:07.951
I couldn't prove it, but I suspected some sort of

50
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:10.727
conspiracy was afoot, so I turned to the one person

51
00:02:10.727 --> 00:02:13.111
I knew had access to all the information.

52
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:14.463
Someone who knew all the players,

53
00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:16.879
the communications, the passwords,

54
00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.427
who could learn the secrets of Critical Role land.

55
00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:21.427
I turned to Marisha Ray.

56
00:02:22.383 --> 00:02:26.942
Tonight, for the first time ever on any RPG show,

57
00:02:26.942 --> 00:02:30.511
we deliver a scathing investigative report.

58
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:33.331
A scandal that might upend this entire race

59
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:37.201
and send the tabletop world into uncharted territory.

60
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:41.185
Tonight, she delivers the Marishaler Report.

61
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:44.621
LIAM: What anime is this?

62
00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:47.069
MARISHA: Thank you, candidate Riegel.

63
00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.635
As you said, I am Marisha Ray.

64
00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:49.576
TRAVIS: That's a lit cigarette.

65
00:02:49.576 --> 00:02:51.630
MARISHA: Careful, careful.

66
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.188
Creative director here,

67
00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:57.241
and also Critical Role's official special prosecutor.

68
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.687
Now when candidate Riegel approached me

69
00:02:59.687 --> 00:03:01.939
about investigating his rival,

70
00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.796
I thought it was just still a desperate attempt

71
00:03:03.796 --> 00:03:07.787
to salvage his ego-driven candidacy.

72
00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:10.120
But, when I started digging,

73
00:03:11.263 --> 00:03:13.291
I discovered lies,

74
00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:15.999
deception, illegal campaign donations--

75
00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.775
SAM: What?
LAURA: No.

76
00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:20.683
MARISHA: --and coordination with foreign powers--

77
00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:21.757
SAM: Impossible.

78
00:03:21.757 --> 00:03:23.685
MARISHA: --that are at least troubling and, at most,

79
00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:25.725
impeachable offenses.

80
00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:28.021
If everyone will allow me?

81
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:29.057
LIAM: We don't do that here.

82
00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:31.183
MATT: What does ciassified mean?

83
00:03:31.183 --> 00:03:33.305
(laughing)

84
00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:35.138
MARISHA: I didn't write this.

85
00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:38.777
I have a lot of assistants that do things for me.

86
00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:39.944
I'm very high.

87
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:44.712
LIAM: Let the farce continue.

88
00:03:44.712 --> 00:03:46.996
MARISHA: High on the chain of command.

89
00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:49.746
LAURA: Keep going, keep going.

90
00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:53.192
MARISHA: Anyway if it pleases the table,

91
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:55.942
I submit as evidence exhibit one,

92
00:03:56.912 --> 00:03:58.769
the phone call.
TRAVIS: What?

93
00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.196
TALIESIN: Oh, what happened?

94
00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:01.807
SAM: I think you have to set it up more.

95
00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:07.012
MARISHA: I submit, as evidence,

96
00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:10.492
exhibit one, the phone call.

97
00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:13.344
Days after the notorious Johnson roast,

98
00:04:13.344 --> 00:04:15.592
my subject, Mr. O'Brien, took a phone call

99
00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:17.048
on Critical Role set.

100
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.208
Now we don't normally record phone calls

101
00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:21.141
of cast members, of course,

102
00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:24.708
and we don't have access to the entire call,

103
00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:26.912
but Critical Role set microphones did pick up

104
00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:28.842
Liam's side of it. We had just finished

105
00:04:28.842 --> 00:04:31.870
recording Crit Recap. Things were still going.

106
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.120
Anyway, listen, just judge for yourself.

107
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.983
Play the tape.

108
00:04:36.983 --> 00:04:38.342
(mumbling)

109
00:04:38.342 --> 00:04:40.640
LIAM (audio): Yes, yes, I'm alone.

110
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.265
(mumbling)

111
00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:44.490
LIAM (audio): You saw our D&amp;D Beyond spot?

112
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.171
It was perfect. So mean.

113
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:49.606
The script you wrote absolutely killed.

114
00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:51.194
Ashley was on fire.

115
00:04:51.194 --> 00:04:53.527
(mumbling)

116
00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.401
LIAM (audio): Yeah, I kind of feel bad for Sam, actually.

117
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:57.642
(mumbling)

118
00:04:57.642 --> 00:05:00.754
LIAM (audio): No, no, you're right, of course.

119
00:05:00.754 --> 00:05:02.379
This is all business.

120
00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.420
(mumbling)

121
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.130
LIAM (audio): No, Sherlock, I'm not getting cold feet.

122
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.782
I won't let my friendship get in the way of our plan.

123
00:05:12.782 --> 00:05:14.330
Oh shit.

124
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.682
Shit, I smell cabbage.

125
00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:18.214
I think Brian just walked in the studio,

126
00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:20.790
I got to go.

127
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.623
(hangup sound)

128
00:05:21.623 --> 00:05:23.489
(footsteps)

129
00:05:24.373 --> 00:05:25.206
LAURA: (gasps)

130
00:05:25.206 --> 00:05:26.715
SAM: Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:05:26.715 --> 00:05:27.548
MARISHA: A plan?

132
00:05:28.637 --> 00:05:29.470
Sherlock?

133
00:05:30.573 --> 00:05:33.230
But who was Liam talking to?

134
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.562
I had to dig deeper.

135
00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:36.932
Me and my team, we poured over emails, texts.

136
00:05:36.932 --> 00:05:40.338
We sifted through the trash, took blood samples,

137
00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:43.234
probably illegal, spoke to witnesses,

138
00:05:43.234 --> 00:05:47.450
and then we stumbled onto exhibit two.

139
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.700
The photograph.

140
00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.470
While combing through Chris Lockey's cast photos,

141
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.238
I noticed something strange about one in particular.

142
00:05:56.238 --> 00:05:57.830
LIAM: What the fuck is going on?

143
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.968
MARISHA: You see this photo was taken

144
00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:00.182
when everyone was chipping in

145
00:06:00.182 --> 00:06:02.462
for a food delivery service.

146
00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:05.434
According to our informants, Liam ordered a vegan bowl

147
00:06:05.434 --> 00:06:07.430
with a side of tofu and kale.

148
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.618
Objectively, a truly disgusting meal,

149
00:06:09.618 --> 00:06:13.294
but one designed to maintain his rugged handsomeness

150
00:06:13.294 --> 00:06:15.950
and oddly muscular physique.

151
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.878
This photo snapped--

152
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.211
(laughter)

153
00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:22.222
-- when Liam opened his wallet to pay.

154
00:06:22.222 --> 00:06:26.062
Yeah, it doesn't seem strange, at first.

155
00:06:26.062 --> 00:06:29.453
Until you zoom closer and enhance.

156
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.937
(gasps and cries of alarm)

157
00:06:31.937 --> 00:06:33.887
TRAVIS: Dun dun dun!

158
00:06:35.722 --> 00:06:36.814
LIAM: I mean that's...

159
00:06:36.814 --> 00:06:37.647
TRAVIS: A witch!

160
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.100
TALIESIN: That could be a picture of anybody.

161
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.580
MARISHA: Soak it in.

162
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.612
Why is Liam's wallet filled with British pounds?

163
00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:45.680
LIAM: What is this bit?

164
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.263
MARISHA: Is there some sort of

165
00:06:47.263 --> 00:06:50.026
international connection here?

166
00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:53.612
Exactly who is bankrolling the O'Brien-Johnson campaign?

167
00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:55.195
I had to go deeper.

168
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.072
So, you see,

169
00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:03.232
as I continued to dig,

170
00:07:06.656 --> 00:07:09.100
I kept going. I dug deeper.

171
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.664
I'm a woman on a mission--
LIAM: Stop, stop, stop!

172
00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.000
MARISHA: Nothing happens in the studio

173
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.116
without me knowing about it, O'Brien!

174
00:07:15.116 --> 00:07:17.197
LIAM: What the fuck are you people doing to me right now?

175
00:07:17.197 --> 00:07:18.497
MARISHA: If you have nothing to hide,

176
00:07:18.497 --> 00:07:21.536
then you have nothing to fear, right?

177
00:07:21.536 --> 00:07:23.980
But I contend that you do have something to hide.

178
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.180
I present exhibit three, the hidden cameras.

179
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.483
Shortly after the wallet incident,

180
00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:30.896
I set up a series of hidden cameras

181
00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:32.422
in the back of the studio.

182
00:07:32.422 --> 00:07:33.310
LIAM: Cameras?

183
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.341
MARISHA: Call it a hunch.

184
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.160
We got a lot of cameras.

185
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.350
So it's super, super convenient.

186
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.166
(laughter)

187
00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:42.916
LIAM: Like in the bathrooms?
MARISHA: Sure enough,

188
00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:45.355
late one night, they recorded a conversation between one

189
00:07:45.355 --> 00:07:49.988
Liam O'Brien and a gentleman, codename Sherlock.

190
00:07:49.988 --> 00:07:52.980
TRAVIS: Is this going to be available on the podcast?

191
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.460
MARISHA: We've since identified this man to be none other

192
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.484
than Mark Hulmes.

193
00:07:58.484 --> 00:07:59.937
LIAM: That's ridiculous.

194
00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:01.664
MARISHA: That Mark Hulmes from

195
00:08:01.664 --> 00:08:06.029
the British D&amp;D streaming show, High Rollers.

196
00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:09.734
A man who was posed as our friend, but is he really?

197
00:08:09.734 --> 00:08:10.817
(whispered) Is he really?

198
00:08:11.656 --> 00:08:12.823
Roll the tape.

199
00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:19.155
MARK: (humming)

200
00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:21.597
(soft electronic music)

201
00:08:21.597 --> 00:08:25.352
MARK: Sticky wizard, is it safe to talk?

202
00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:26.685
LIAM: Yes, Sherlock.

203
00:08:29.294 --> 00:08:30.824
Everyone's practicing puppet voices

204
00:08:30.824 --> 00:08:33.044
for Yee-Haw Game Ranch right now.

205
00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:35.220
Usually takes an hour or two.

206
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.172
They think it's hilarious.

207
00:08:37.172 --> 00:08:39.255
MARK: My God, they're stupid.

208
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.652
Well, so after you win the D&amp;D Beyond election,

209
00:08:43.652 --> 00:08:45.819
you remember your mission?

210
00:08:47.084 --> 00:08:49.107
LIAM: I know what I have to do, Sherlock.

211
00:08:50.024 --> 00:08:51.974
Convert the D&amp;D Beyond app to the British system

212
00:08:51.974 --> 00:08:54.296
of weights and measurements.

213
00:08:54.296 --> 00:08:56.954
(soft electronic music)

214
00:08:56.954 --> 00:08:59.220
LIAM: I mean, won't that be confusing, though?

215
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.536
Nobody knows what a stone is and what it weighs.

216
00:09:02.536 --> 00:09:05.628
MARK: Don't question me, O'Brien.

217
00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.252
I'm paying for your entire campaign.

218
00:09:08.252 --> 00:09:10.188
I paid for your launch video,

219
00:09:10.188 --> 00:09:12.525
I paid to rig the election polls,

220
00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:15.092
I've paid for thousands of bots to post

221
00:09:15.092 --> 00:09:18.648
hashtag Liam For President on Twitter.

222
00:09:18.648 --> 00:09:21.196
Just remember you're nothing without me.

223
00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:23.160
You could never beat Sam.

224
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.020
He's clearly the most charismatic of the two of you.

225
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.036
Do you really want me to cut you off?

226
00:09:28.036 --> 00:09:29.388
LIAM: No.

227
00:09:29.388 --> 00:09:30.971
Sherlock, it's just,

228
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.928
you really want D&amp;D Beyond app

229
00:09:33.928 --> 00:09:36.761
to change all vests to waistcoats?

230
00:09:37.636 --> 00:09:40.068
All carts to lorries, all uniforms to kits?

231
00:09:40.068 --> 00:09:41.612
You want me to change every time it says

232
00:09:41.612 --> 00:09:44.040
counter clockwise to anti clockwise?

233
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.373
MARK: Yes, yes I do.

234
00:09:46.454 --> 00:09:48.255
I want to change it all.

235
00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:53.100
I want to change your stupid American Zs to zeds.

236
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.616
I want to put the u back in color, and valor, and parlor.

237
00:09:57.616 --> 00:09:59.268
I want it all.

238
00:09:59.268 --> 00:10:00.180
LIAM: Yeah, but why?

239
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.025
MARK: Because I'm mad, mad with power.

240
00:10:03.025 --> 00:10:05.689
I won't stop until all of D&amp;D Beyond

241
00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:09.522
is using proper, appropriate British phrasing.

242
00:10:09.522 --> 00:10:12.052
(laughs evilly)

243
00:10:12.052 --> 00:10:15.093
(soft electronic music)

244
00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:15.926
LIAM: Fine.

245
00:10:17.124 --> 00:10:19.612
But I'm running low on cash.

246
00:10:19.612 --> 00:10:22.056
MARK: Oh you've been a jolly good chap.

247
00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:24.592
I'll send you a few farthings.

248
00:10:24.592 --> 00:10:25.852
LIAM: What the hell is a farthing?

249
00:10:25.852 --> 00:10:29.408
MARK: No one knows. That's the beauty of it.

250
00:10:29.408 --> 00:10:32.849
Just remember, you work for me.

251
00:10:34.404 --> 00:10:37.413
Destroy Sam Riegel, win the presidency,

252
00:10:37.413 --> 00:10:39.746
and then do what I tell you.

253
00:10:41.243 --> 00:10:42.076
LIAM: Yes, sir.

254
00:10:43.312 --> 00:10:44.145
Goodbye.

255
00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:46.728
MARK: Ah, ah, ah, I think you mean?

256
00:10:48.526 --> 00:10:49.859
LIAM: Sorry, I meant

257
00:10:51.954 --> 00:10:53.374
pip pip, cheerio.

258
00:10:53.374 --> 00:10:58.241
(soft electronic music)

259
00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:03.225
(soft electronic music)

260
00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:06.942
(soft electronic music)

261
00:11:08.182 --> 00:11:11.765
MARISHA: So there you have it, cold hard evidence.

262
00:11:13.794 --> 00:11:17.378
I make no judgment. It's up to the people.

263
00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:21.322
But it was my duty to show the world the truth.

264
00:11:21.322 --> 00:11:22.420
I rest my case.

265
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.336
SAM: Well, that was impressive. Thorough.

266
00:11:26.336 --> 00:11:27.716
MARISHA: Thank you.
SAM: Legitimate.

267
00:11:27.716 --> 00:11:31.868
MARISHA: Yeah, I haven't worked for three weeks.

268
00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:33.666
SAM: All I can say is,

269
00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:36.368
that's our D&amp;D Beyond ad for the night.

270
00:11:36.368 --> 00:11:37.868
Matt, over to you.

271
00:11:39.485 --> 00:11:42.640
MATT: Thank you, Sam and thank you D&amp;D Beyond

272
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.057
for being so tolerant

273
00:11:46.447 --> 00:11:47.814
of everything.

274
00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:50.464
(laughs)

275
00:11:50.464 --> 00:11:51.560
LIAM: I don't know what's going on here,

276
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.047
but you all will hear from my lawyers.

277
00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.532
ASHLEY: I don't know anything about this.

278
00:11:55.532 --> 00:11:56.611
SAM: You'll get a chance to respond next week,

279
00:11:56.611 --> 00:11:59.631
but let's the people digest this bombshell information.

280
00:11:59.631 --> 00:12:01.400
MATT: Yes, there needs to be some.

281
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.411
I have a lot to think about after that.

282
00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:05.127
MARISHA: Max, let's put this through the shredder.

283
00:12:05.127 --> 00:12:05.960
TALIESIN: I don't know if Marisha should be

284
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.819
wearing a wig or not.

285
00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:09.940
MATT: Our second sponsor tonight--

286
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.190
(laughing)

287
00:12:13.543 --> 00:12:17.043
MATT: Our fantastic friends at Eldritch Foundry.

288
00:12:18.331 --> 00:12:19.631
They're sponsoring this episode.

289
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:22.408
Once again, they are a crew of amazing critters.

290
00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:26.519
They've created a system for fully-customizable,

291
00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:30.195
3D-printed miniatures for your home games.

292
00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:32.819
There's an example of one of their awesome prints

293
00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.377
right there.

294
00:12:34.377 --> 00:12:35.210
LAURA: What?

295
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.908
(exclaiming)

296
00:12:36.908 --> 00:12:38.575
MATT: It's pretty bad ass.

297
00:12:39.657 --> 00:12:41.007
High quality miniatures are sleek.

298
00:12:41.007 --> 00:12:42.299
They look awesome, as you can see.

299
00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:44.383
Each race is distinct and different from one another.

300
00:12:45.883 --> 00:12:48.539
In success of this whole scenario

301
00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:49.963
with their Kickstarter campaign,

302
00:12:49.963 --> 00:12:52.300
they're planning with local gaming stores as well,

303
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.211
so it's not just an online opportunity for you to seize.

304
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:57.011
Their ongoing Kickstarter campaign can be found

305
00:12:57.011 --> 00:13:00.463
at critrole.com/eldritchfoundry,

306
00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:02.591
and has just one more week to go before it finishes,

307
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:05.253
so check it out and be a part of it if you can.

308
00:13:05.253 --> 00:13:07.024
LIAM: Now we're going to perform all of Canterbury Tales

309
00:13:07.024 --> 00:13:09.444
as part of the sponsorship promotion, right?

310
00:13:09.444 --> 00:13:10.277
SAM: You guys made a 15 minute

311
00:13:10.277 --> 00:13:13.375
short film about it, didn't you?

312
00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:14.819
Experimental short video?

313
00:13:14.819 --> 00:13:18.077
TALIESIN: I think that's on the internet. Like, that just--

314
00:13:19.213 --> 00:13:21.610
TRAVIS: Automatically disqualified from all awards again.

315
00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:24.993
MATT: I can't even make the joke that

316
00:13:24.993 --> 00:13:27.266
we have too much free time because we don't.

317
00:13:27.266 --> 00:13:28.154
Which is why it's more surprising that

318
00:13:28.154 --> 00:13:29.821
that shit gets made.

319
00:13:30.962 --> 00:13:32.114
MARISHA: We can't help ourselves.

320
00:13:32.114 --> 00:13:33.917
MATT: A few more announcements, bear with me.

321
00:13:33.917 --> 00:13:36.569
The Tales of Equestria one shot,

322
00:13:36.569 --> 00:13:39.089
the My Little Pony one shot run by,

323
00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:41.837
you know, our Moriarty, Mark Hulmes from the video,

324
00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:43.485
is airing tomorrow night, May 31st,

325
00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:46.365
at 7:00pm Pacific on our Twitch channel here.

326
00:13:46.365 --> 00:13:49.141
VOD will be made available immediately

327
00:13:49.141 --> 00:13:50.445
for our Twitch channel subscribers

328
00:13:50.445 --> 00:13:53.725
and will be on our YouTube channel Sunday morning.

329
00:13:53.725 --> 00:13:54.629
So if you miss it tomorrow night,

330
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:56.597
it'll be there Sunday for you, waiting.

331
00:13:56.597 --> 00:13:58.305
Next Monday, June 3rd,

332
00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.045
we have a very special one-off episode of Between the Sheets

333
00:14:00.045 --> 00:14:03.197
with our own lovely Ashley Johnson.

334
00:14:03.197 --> 00:14:05.030
ASHLEY: Hey! I forgot about that.

335
00:14:06.089 --> 00:14:07.465
That's out this Monday?
MATT: This Monday.

336
00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:09.132
ASHLEY: Hey, how about it?

337
00:14:10.185 --> 00:14:11.417
Hey, man.

338
00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:12.615
MATT: Seven p.m. Pacific on Monday

339
00:14:12.615 --> 00:14:15.482
on our Twitch channel, where you are right now.

340
00:14:15.482 --> 00:14:17.625
We also, I guess-- wow, we launched our official

341
00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:20.461
Instagram account. That happened.

342
00:14:20.461 --> 00:14:23.009
LAURA: Finally we did it!

343
00:14:23.009 --> 00:14:24.164
MATT: Go ahead and give us a follow

344
00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:26.664
at critical_role on Instagram.

345
00:14:28.244 --> 00:14:30.916
And we are preparing tomorrow morning

346
00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:34.517
to fly ourselves out to Denver, Colorado

347
00:14:34.517 --> 00:14:38.017
for this weekend's Denver Pop Culture Con.

348
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:42.102
We have limited autograph and photo tickets available

349
00:14:42.102 --> 00:14:44.701
at denverpopculturecon.com.

350
00:14:44.701 --> 00:14:46.053
If you're looking to make it out there,

351
00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:47.881
see if you can grab what's left on there

352
00:14:47.881 --> 00:14:49.975
and we look forward to seeing you guys there shortly.

353
00:14:50.966 --> 00:14:53.962
(exhales) That took less than the first bit.

354
00:14:53.962 --> 00:14:55.820
(laughter)

355
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.333
MATT: But here we are.

356
00:14:57.333 --> 00:14:59.477
All right guys, unless we have anything else planned,

357
00:14:59.477 --> 00:15:02.803

(dragon roaring)

400
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:43.955
MATT: Welcome back.

401
00:16:43.955 --> 00:16:46.173
So, no you did not.
SAM: We forgot!

402
00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:48.153
MATT: You totally forgot.

403
00:16:48.153 --> 00:16:49.551
It was a beautiful moment of silence

404
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.471
that I'll cherish forever.

405
00:16:51.471 --> 00:16:52.835
SAM: Ball sack!

406
00:16:52.835 --> 00:16:54.513
MATT: You're a little...

407
00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:56.539
Doesn't work, Sam, sorry.

408
00:16:56.539 --> 00:16:58.289
So, last we left off,

409
00:16:59.647 --> 00:17:03.871
the Mighty Nein had uncovered some strange

410
00:17:03.871 --> 00:17:07.515
growing conspiracy between the strange devices

411
00:17:07.515 --> 00:17:09.543
that were causing portals to tear open

412
00:17:09.543 --> 00:17:12.435
into the abyss across Xhorhas.

413
00:17:12.435 --> 00:17:14.715
You had scryed and discovered an individual

414
00:17:14.715 --> 00:17:16.995
who's involved with this to some degree

415
00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.995
and had set up a meeting in Rosohna

416
00:17:19.995 --> 00:17:21.975
in the Overcrow Apothecary.

417
00:17:21.975 --> 00:17:24.495
And, lying in wait, you managed to assault

418
00:17:24.495 --> 00:17:25.863
the people that were involved,

419
00:17:25.863 --> 00:17:28.531
killing two, but the one, seemingly

420
00:17:28.531 --> 00:17:32.415
the most important one, fled to the north.

421
00:17:32.415 --> 00:17:34.695
You, through scrying and Speaking with Dead,

422
00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:37.487
managed to gather the information you had at your disposal,

423
00:17:37.487 --> 00:17:40.231
grab your moorbounders, and make your way northward

424
00:17:40.231 --> 00:17:44.356
to pursue them towards the city of Bazzoxan, the location.

425
00:17:45.362 --> 00:17:48.827
You made your way directly through the Barbed Fields

426
00:17:48.827 --> 00:17:51.271
and are currently there as you've

427
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:53.147
traversed your first day and a half

428
00:17:53.147 --> 00:17:55.980
of your three day journey across the Barbed Fields,

429
00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.480
where you noticed a really unique dangerous landscape,

430
00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:04.351
relics and signs of the great ancient wars

431
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:07.183
of the final moments of the Calamity,

432
00:18:07.183 --> 00:18:09.375
marred landscape before you,

433
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:14.125
and came upon strange creatures that seem a little lonely

434
00:18:15.167 --> 00:18:16.917
and just wanted a hug

435
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:20.791
that assaulted you in the middle of the field

436
00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:24.363
and some of the nearby fungus growing trees.

437
00:18:24.363 --> 00:18:28.439
The battle completed, you've all went to

438
00:18:28.439 --> 00:18:30.643
bed down for the evening for some rest.

439
00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:33.421
If I recall, we ended there

440
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:35.893
and are continuing the next leg of your journey

441
00:18:35.893 --> 00:18:38.147
across the Barbed Fields.

442
00:18:38.147 --> 00:18:40.097
So, Mighty Nein,

443
00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:43.051
what would you like to do?

444
00:18:43.051 --> 00:18:45.511
LIAM: Are we saying that it is the next morning now

445
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:47.131
or are we going through the night?

446
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:48.887
MATT: We're going through the night at this point.

447
00:18:48.887 --> 00:18:50.611
LIAM: Through the night, okay.

448
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:51.824
LAURA: Oy vey.

449
00:18:51.824 --> 00:18:56.824
Hold on, I got to pick some spells for the next day now.

450
00:18:56.849 --> 00:18:58.455
TALIESIN: I know, I'm doing my spell checks.

451
00:18:58.455 --> 00:19:00.571
SAM: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you clerics

452
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:01.563
did all the cleric-ing,

453
00:19:01.563 --> 00:19:05.327
the before bed cleric-ing that you do, right?

454
00:19:05.327 --> 00:19:07.740
LAURA: Yeah, we healed ourselves.

455
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.023
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

456
00:19:10.023 --> 00:19:13.171
MATT: You haven't found a place necessarily to rest yet,

457
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:14.567
if I recall you were in the process,

458
00:19:14.567 --> 00:19:15.723
or did you set up a dome?

459
00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:16.727
SAM: We were just going to do the dome.

460
00:19:16.727 --> 00:19:19.095
LIAM: I don't remember. I don't think we got that far.

461
00:19:19.095 --> 00:19:21.526
I think that there was just the end of the fight.

462
00:19:21.526 --> 00:19:23.535
LAURA: And we were terrified.
MATT: That's true, actually.

463
00:19:23.535 --> 00:19:26.176
All right, well, let's pick up from there, then.

464
00:19:28.383 --> 00:19:32.251
LIAM: Well, I smear some bat shit away off of my hands

465
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:35.001
and look around and, do we--

466
00:19:36.811 --> 00:19:38.669
are we going any further

467
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:39.783
after that?

468
00:19:39.783 --> 00:19:41.011
SAM: We're bedding here.

469
00:19:41.011 --> 00:19:43.695
LAURA: I think they got stronger in the dark, <i>ja</i>?

470
00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:44.763
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what it seems.

471
00:19:44.763 --> 00:19:47.491
LAURA: We should definitely hide at night

472
00:19:47.491 --> 00:19:49.215
and travel during the day.

473
00:19:49.215 --> 00:19:51.375
TALIESIN: We can maybe get a little bit of extra travel

474
00:19:51.375 --> 00:19:53.131
with some Daylight spells, but other than that.

475
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:54.855
LIAM: But at the moment, the globe is still going.

476
00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:57.107
It's an hour of that, so--

477
00:19:57.107 --> 00:19:58.683
TALIESIN: So we'll want to maybe

478
00:19:58.683 --> 00:20:01.364
get the last of that out maybe or--?

479
00:20:01.364 --> 00:20:02.611
MATT: I think that was correct. I think you guys did

480
00:20:02.611 --> 00:20:04.348
bed down in the dome to sleep that night.

481
00:20:04.348 --> 00:20:05.728
TALIESIN: Oh, we may have.

482
00:20:05.728 --> 00:20:07.544
LIAM: (rewinding sounds)

483
00:20:07.544 --> 00:20:08.544
LAURA: Let's get in the dome.

484
00:20:08.544 --> 00:20:10.127
SAM: Good night, Caleb.

485
00:20:11.137 --> 00:20:11.970
Stop talking.

486
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.477
MARISHA: Good night, Jester.

487
00:20:13.477 --> 00:20:15.049
LAURA: Good night, Beau.

488
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:15.921
TALIESIN: Good night, Ned.

489
00:20:15.921 --> 00:20:17.121
MARISHA: Good night, Fjord.

490
00:20:17.121 --> 00:20:18.113
SAM: Good night, Ned.

491
00:20:19.221 --> 00:20:20.638
MATT: Good night, Ned.

492
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:24.349
All right.

493
00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:26.585
So, evening's rest comes to you.

494
00:20:26.585 --> 00:20:28.189
Is anyone keeping watch or are you all

495
00:20:28.189 --> 00:20:29.022
sleeping for the night?

496
00:20:29.022 --> 00:20:31.355
ASHLEY: I'll take the first watch.

497
00:20:34.845 --> 00:20:36.645
SAM: Okay, do you need some company?

498
00:20:36.645 --> 00:20:37.501
Are you okay?

499
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:39.329
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, I feel like I'm okay,

500
00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:41.161
if everybody wants to get some sleep.

501
00:20:41.161 --> 00:20:42.285
I don't know what the best way

502
00:20:42.285 --> 00:20:45.193
for us all to get a decent rest is.

503
00:20:45.193 --> 00:20:47.624
LAURA: I think I already clicked that I got a long rest,

504
00:20:47.624 --> 00:20:50.265
but you know what I'm going to take first watch with you.

505
00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:54.515
ASHLEY: Okay, yeah, it would be nice to have some company.

506
00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:01.409
LAURA: Go to sleep everyone. It's okay. We'll keep watch.

507
00:21:01.409 --> 00:21:02.909
ASHLEY: We got it.

508
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:03.957
Take care.

509
00:21:03.957 --> 00:21:05.757
LAURA: Yasha.
ASHLEY: Yeah?

510
00:21:05.757 --> 00:21:07.601
LAURA: Those things were fucking scary as fuck.

511
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:10.630
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm not scared of a lot of things,

512
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.503
but those things freaked me out.

513
00:21:12.503 --> 00:21:14.478
LAURA: Had you ever seen them before here?

514
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:17.189
ASHLEY: No.

515
00:21:17.189 --> 00:21:20.085
I've never seen anything like that before.

516
00:21:20.085 --> 00:21:21.717
And they seemed so sad.

517
00:21:21.717 --> 00:21:22.889
LAURA: I know they--
ASHLEY: You know?

518
00:21:22.889 --> 00:21:25.330
LAURA: He like, he looked like if he could have cried,

519
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.669
he would have been crying.

520
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:30.117
ASHLEY: Yeah, like it was a person once or something,

521
00:21:30.117 --> 00:21:31.200
I don't know.

522
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.398
LAURA: Like they didn't maybe want to fight us.

523
00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:36.619
They were forced to, maybe?

524
00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:38.582
Also, though, they were really scary,

525
00:21:38.582 --> 00:21:40.398
so I don't feel that sorry for them.

526
00:21:40.398 --> 00:21:43.315
ASHLEY: I don't feel that bad, but I just--

527
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.306
it was weird, the sounds that they were making

528
00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:49.556
and everything.

529
00:21:50.394 --> 00:21:53.929
I didn't like it. This is a weird place.

530
00:21:53.929 --> 00:21:55.472
LAURA: You grew up here.

531
00:21:55.472 --> 00:21:56.305
ASHLEY: Well I,

532
00:21:57.348 --> 00:22:00.057
I did, but not quite

533
00:22:00.057 --> 00:22:02.406
in an area like this.

534
00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:03.874
LAURA: Not the Barbed Fields.

535
00:22:03.874 --> 00:22:06.138
ASHLEY: Yeah, no, this is--

536
00:22:06.138 --> 00:22:08.971
I've heard about them, but this is--

537
00:22:10.954 --> 00:22:12.770
I'm glad that this isn't,

538
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.710
that I didn't grow up here in this place.

539
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.810
LAURA: Are you nervous?

540
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:18.643
ASHLEY: Yeah.

541
00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.227
Yeah, I'm nervous. I just don't know what we're

542
00:22:24.227 --> 00:22:26.158
walking into, you know?

543
00:22:26.158 --> 00:22:26.991
LAURA: Yeah.

544
00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:29.910
We've got your back though.

545
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:33.194
That guy isn't going to do anything bad to you.

546
00:22:33.194 --> 00:22:36.106
And I know that, you know,

547
00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:40.786
he seemed to respect you or know about you,

548
00:22:40.786 --> 00:22:44.619
or like the things that you've done, you know?

549
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.978
ASHLEY: Yeah.

550
00:22:47.978 --> 00:22:49.906
LAURA: Who knows, maybe when you lost your memory

551
00:22:49.906 --> 00:22:53.656
you were like, like a rock star or something.

552
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.560
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe I

553
00:23:00.207 --> 00:23:01.906
performed and I--

554
00:23:01.906 --> 00:23:03.943
LAURA: Yeah, maybe there was like a bar or something

555
00:23:03.943 --> 00:23:05.111
and you performed every night

556
00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:06.722
and everybody came to see you and then

557
00:23:06.722 --> 00:23:08.172
you disappeared and everyone was like

558
00:23:08.172 --> 00:23:09.721
aw, where's that Yasha chick?

559
00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:11.989
She's so good. The Orphan Maker.

560
00:23:11.989 --> 00:23:13.847
ASHLEY: I wonder what instrument I played?

561
00:23:13.847 --> 00:23:15.264
LAURA: Definitely like

562
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.746
a harp.

563
00:23:17.746 --> 00:23:20.496
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think I could probably--

564
00:23:21.473 --> 00:23:22.597
LAURA: Yeah, like, yeah.

565
00:23:22.597 --> 00:23:25.401
But like a really like hardcore harp.

566
00:23:25.401 --> 00:23:27.151
ASHLEY: Yeah, like it's like,

567
00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:30.232
dun dun!

568
00:23:30.232 --> 00:23:32.471
(laughter)

569
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:33.804
ASHLEY: I don't know.

570
00:23:34.785 --> 00:23:36.333
That would be pretty cool.

571
00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:38.510
I think I'm just mostly nervous because I

572
00:23:39.993 --> 00:23:41.433
I feel like he knows--

573
00:23:41.433 --> 00:23:43.353
it's weird when you feel like someone knows

574
00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:45.714
something about you that you don't know.

575
00:23:45.714 --> 00:23:46.547
LAURA: Yeah.

576
00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:51.353
ASHLEY: And I hope it's just

577
00:23:51.353 --> 00:23:53.886
that I was a rock star.

578
00:23:53.886 --> 00:23:56.317
LAURA: Maybe we can learn from him.

579
00:23:56.317 --> 00:23:57.847
Maybe he's not a horrible guy

580
00:23:57.847 --> 00:24:00.937
and you can find out what he knows.

581
00:24:00.937 --> 00:24:03.637
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's true.

582
00:24:05.917 --> 00:24:08.301
Okay, well maybe I should be thinking about it

583
00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:10.468
more positively than I am.

584
00:24:12.473 --> 00:24:15.833
I'll just pretend that I was a harp star.

585
00:24:15.833 --> 00:24:17.693
LAURA: And if it was something bad,

586
00:24:17.693 --> 00:24:19.613
just let me know if you want to forget it again

587
00:24:19.613 --> 00:24:22.088
because I think we can make you forget.

588
00:24:22.088 --> 00:24:23.673
ASHLEY: Really?
LAURA: Yeah.

589
00:24:23.673 --> 00:24:25.590
At least for a while.

590
00:24:29.114 --> 00:24:32.449
ASHLEY: Okay, that's not a bad idea. Thank you, Jester.

591
00:24:32.449 --> 00:24:36.282
LAURA: Maybe not the best way to deal with it, but...

592
00:24:37.367 --> 00:24:39.361
ASHLEY: Well I've always learned that the best way

593
00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:42.632
to deal with your problems is to run away from them.

594
00:24:42.632 --> 00:24:43.465
(laughter)

595
00:24:45.421 --> 00:24:47.921
LAURA: Hey, we're doing a good job.

596
00:24:49.116 --> 00:24:50.506
MATT: Both of you make perception checks for me, please.

597
00:24:50.506 --> 00:24:51.339
LAURA: Oh no.

598
00:24:54.214 --> 00:24:55.464
A natural 20!

599
00:24:56.614 --> 00:24:58.114
ASHLEY: Oh, a natural 19!

600
00:25:00.362 --> 00:25:01.195
MATT: Very nice.

601
00:25:01.195 --> 00:25:02.274
ASHLEY: We were like this.

602
00:25:02.274 --> 00:25:03.982
SAM: Bodes well.

603
00:25:03.982 --> 00:25:05.002
Nothing bad will happen.

604
00:25:05.002 --> 00:25:06.098
MATT: So as you're having this conversation,

605
00:25:06.098 --> 00:25:08.706
you do notice this shape in the darkness

606
00:25:08.706 --> 00:25:11.934
moving on the peripheral past it.

607
00:25:11.934 --> 00:25:13.958
It's large and lumbering and you feel

608
00:25:13.958 --> 00:25:18.441
just a light (rumbling footsteps).

609
00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:21.032
LAURA: Nothing can get through here.

610
00:25:21.032 --> 00:25:22.140
Nothing can get through here.

611
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.775
MATT: You see the shaping of a lumbering and shifting

612
00:25:25.775 --> 00:25:29.223
with its odd multi-impacting gait

613
00:25:29.223 --> 00:25:30.623
and you watch it move up towards one of the

614
00:25:30.623 --> 00:25:33.367
strange curving spires of stone

615
00:25:33.367 --> 00:25:36.699
that seem to be hooking up about 60 or 70 feet in the air

616
00:25:36.699 --> 00:25:40.349
and this entity goes up towards it and

617
00:25:40.349 --> 00:25:42.073
(impact sound) butts against it

618
00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:44.278
and begins scratching its shoulders and back.

619
00:25:44.278 --> 00:25:45.383
LAURA: How high did he go on it?

620
00:25:45.383 --> 00:25:47.508
MATT: About 25 feet.

621
00:25:48.558 --> 00:25:50.891
LAURA: Yasha, that thing is huge.

622
00:25:51.799 --> 00:25:54.393
MATT: You look at its shape and the more you focus

623
00:25:54.393 --> 00:25:56.135
with the perception rolls that you guys took,

624
00:25:56.135 --> 00:26:01.135
you can see little hints of the four red orbs

625
00:26:01.595 --> 00:26:03.243
that are affixed as eyes in the center

626
00:26:03.243 --> 00:26:06.619
of its neckless face, large tusks that protrude

627
00:26:06.619 --> 00:26:07.787
from the front of its mouth.

628
00:26:07.787 --> 00:26:09.947
This is an udaak, which you had seen

629
00:26:09.947 --> 00:26:13.516
on the outside of Asarius and when you first entered

630
00:26:13.516 --> 00:26:15.335
Xhorhas in the distance.

631
00:26:15.335 --> 00:26:17.761
You've been aware of these beasts,

632
00:26:17.761 --> 00:26:20.595
with your times in the fields.

633
00:26:20.595 --> 00:26:23.345
Extremely dangerous, territorial.

634
00:26:24.343 --> 00:26:26.730
They are generally scavengers for the most part,

635
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.649
unless hungry. If they're going hungry,

636
00:26:28.649 --> 00:26:31.935
they've been prone to hunt and get angry.

637
00:26:31.935 --> 00:26:33.685
But they are massive,

638
00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:39.763
and very very intimidating.

639
00:26:39.763 --> 00:26:43.212
You can see the two sets of arms at his forearms,

640
00:26:43.212 --> 00:26:45.014
kind of gorilla like, moving,

641
00:26:45.014 --> 00:26:46.859
and it's just scraping its shoulder

642
00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:49.762
back against the spire, like a large bear

643
00:26:49.762 --> 00:26:51.606
trying to scratch an itch.

644
00:26:51.606 --> 00:26:53.378
LAURA: Oh he just needs a pet.

645
00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:54.769
ASHLEY: Yeah, he's a little scratchy.

646
00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:57.188
LAURA: We could go up and scratch his little back.

647
00:26:57.188 --> 00:26:59.047
MATT: It's just leaning against the base of it,

648
00:26:59.047 --> 00:27:01.776
scraping against it, you hear this like low guttural.

649
00:27:01.776 --> 00:27:05.629
(satisfied snorting)

650
00:27:05.629 --> 00:27:06.796
LAURA: Get it good.

651
00:27:07.942 --> 00:27:09.417
MATT: (impact sound)

652
00:27:09.417 --> 00:27:11.440
It comes off of the spire.

653
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.690
(grunting)

654
00:27:14.828 --> 00:27:18.495
Then begins to scan over in your direction.

655
00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:21.265
Looks past.

656
00:27:22.626 --> 00:27:24.596
ASHLEY: Can he see us in here?

657
00:27:24.596 --> 00:27:26.604
LAURA: No, but he can hear us.

658
00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:30.679
MATT: (rumbling footsteps)

659
00:27:30.679 --> 00:27:33.536
Then it just slowly moves a little further

660
00:27:33.536 --> 00:27:36.323
and further away until the darkness takes it entirely

661
00:27:36.323 --> 00:27:38.260
and it's no longer visible.

662
00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.388
LAURA: Oh my God, what if we run into one of those

663
00:27:40.388 --> 00:27:42.711
while we're traveling through here?

664
00:27:43.944 --> 00:27:44.777
ASHLEY: Well,

665
00:27:45.908 --> 00:27:49.736
I've seen them before and we've fought them in my tribe,

666
00:27:49.736 --> 00:27:52.464
but not without losing some members.

667
00:27:52.464 --> 00:27:55.420
They're very, very, very dangerous.

668
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.637
But maybe we can,

669
00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:01.104
maybe we won't see him again,

670
00:28:01.104 --> 00:28:04.164
and if we do maybe we can just offer some scritches.

671
00:28:04.164 --> 00:28:06.744
LAURA: Just climb up and give him some scritches.

672
00:28:06.744 --> 00:28:10.911
MATT: I would say, in your time with the Dolorav tribe,

673
00:28:11.901 --> 00:28:14.318
two udaaks fell to the tribe.

674
00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.881
Neither were being intentionally hunted.

675
00:28:16.881 --> 00:28:18.488
It was a hunting party came across one

676
00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:19.780
and were forced to fight it.

677
00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.524
Like they're, they're considered too dangerous to hunt.

678
00:28:22.524 --> 00:28:24.056
And while they were both killed,

679
00:28:24.056 --> 00:28:25.196
there were usually hunting parties

680
00:28:25.196 --> 00:28:27.368
of between 15 and 20 people,

681
00:28:27.368 --> 00:28:31.868
and anywhere from five to 10 died in the process

682
00:28:31.868 --> 00:28:33.804
of taking it down.

683
00:28:33.804 --> 00:28:37.764
So it's no trifle creature.

684
00:28:37.764 --> 00:28:39.839
TRAVIS: Whose idea was it to come this way? (scoffs)

685
00:28:40.705 --> 00:28:43.480
(laughter)

686
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.080
MATT: You finish your watch,

687
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.413
uneventful beyond this unique encounter.

688
00:28:49.508 --> 00:28:51.264
Next watch, anybody?

689
00:28:51.264 --> 00:28:52.136
TRAVIS: I'll go.

690
00:28:52.136 --> 00:28:53.348
SAM: Me too.

691
00:28:53.348 --> 00:28:57.415
MATT: All right, the two of you take second watch.

692
00:28:57.415 --> 00:28:58.856
You're welcome to make a perception check, if you'd like.

693
00:28:58.856 --> 00:29:00.356
SAM: I would love to.

694
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.193
17!

695
00:29:03.218 --> 00:29:04.240
TRAVIS: 10.

696
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.056
MATT: 10, okay.
TRAVIS: Fucking 10.

697
00:29:06.056 --> 00:29:07.600
LIAM: Did you know you're dressed like a tiger?

698
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.940
SAM: Hadn't occurred to me.

699
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.048
MATT: Technically not a tiger.

700
00:29:11.048 --> 00:29:12.490
TRAVIS: Probably a liger.

701
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.639
SAM: Mmm. Backwards hands.

702
00:29:17.768 --> 00:29:21.516
MATT: Uneventful, other than the sounds of distant

703
00:29:21.516 --> 00:29:26.032
screeching of flying evening birds of prey,

704
00:29:26.032 --> 00:29:28.445
far enough away to where you're keeping an eye out,

705
00:29:28.445 --> 00:29:30.306
but no one seems to be coming closer.

706
00:29:30.306 --> 00:29:33.084
Take notice the opaque dark colored domes

707
00:29:33.084 --> 00:29:38.084
seem to be enough to keep the eyes of such creatures at bay.

708
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.828
TRAVIS: How can it be chirping when it's screeching?

709
00:29:46.416 --> 00:29:48.249
MATT: Whose idea was this?

710
00:29:49.202 --> 00:29:50.992
Your watch completes without issue.

711
00:29:50.992 --> 00:29:52.564
Third and final watch anybody?

712
00:29:52.564 --> 00:29:53.436
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

713
00:29:53.436 --> 00:29:55.269
MATT: All right, Caduceus.

714
00:29:57.172 --> 00:29:59.164
By himself. Go ahead and roll a perception check.

715
00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:00.739
TALIESIN: Ah bully, I'll start making breakfast

716
00:30:00.739 --> 00:30:01.830
for everyone, too.

717
00:30:03.905 --> 00:30:04.738
15.

718
00:30:05.748 --> 00:30:06.581
MATT: 15, okay.

719
00:30:07.712 --> 00:30:11.824
You catch towards the beginning stages of dawn,

720
00:30:11.824 --> 00:30:15.272
the blues beginning to creep into the sky,

721
00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:18.108
but through the night the stars began to slowly vanish

722
00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:21.752
as a storm front began to come in.

723
00:30:21.752 --> 00:30:24.692
Low gray clouds with darkened patches in the distance

724
00:30:24.692 --> 00:30:28.366
and, as the sky began to lighten up slightly more

725
00:30:28.366 --> 00:30:31.804
and more, you can see there's no rainfall at the moment,

726
00:30:31.804 --> 00:30:33.471
but there is another

727
00:30:34.336 --> 00:30:37.844
medium intensity storm on the way.

728
00:30:39.331 --> 00:30:41.177
Beyond that, no other major issues,

729
00:30:41.177 --> 00:30:43.113
you guys come to consciousness,

730
00:30:43.113 --> 00:30:45.737
breakfast is awaiting you at the hands of Caduceus Clay.

731
00:30:45.737 --> 00:30:48.374
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a spell for that.

732
00:30:48.374 --> 00:30:50.177
MARISHA: Caduceus, why didn't you wake me up?

733
00:30:50.177 --> 00:30:52.516
I would have done the last watch with you.

734
00:30:52.516 --> 00:30:54.725
TALIESIN: Oh, I didn't-- no idea,

735
00:30:54.725 --> 00:30:56.765
and I figured everyone needed some sleep.

736
00:30:56.765 --> 00:30:58.025
LIAM: Everything hurts.

737
00:30:58.025 --> 00:31:00.465
TALIESIN: I wanted to see the sun come up.

738
00:31:00.465 --> 00:31:01.817
It'd been a while.

739
00:31:01.817 --> 00:31:02.866
MARISHA: How was it?

740
00:31:02.866 --> 00:31:06.453
TALIESIN: Brief before this, but it was worth while.

741
00:31:06.453 --> 00:31:07.577
LAURA: Thanks for making food.

742
00:31:07.577 --> 00:31:11.597
TALIESIN: Oh, no problem. Sorry it's a little basic, but.

743
00:31:11.597 --> 00:31:14.269
LIAM: We should get moving as quickly as we can.

744
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:15.965
LAURA: Use up all the daylight.

745
00:31:15.965 --> 00:31:17.871
MARISHA: Caduceus, does it look like that storm front's

746
00:31:17.871 --> 00:31:19.393
heading our way?

747
00:31:19.393 --> 00:31:20.226
TALIESIN: Does it look like that storm front

748
00:31:20.226 --> 00:31:21.917
is heading our way?

749
00:31:21.917 --> 00:31:24.361
MATT: It is heading across the entire fields

750
00:31:24.361 --> 00:31:26.957
at an angle. So it is making its way towards

751
00:31:26.957 --> 00:31:28.517
not you specifically, but it is going to be

752
00:31:28.517 --> 00:31:30.765
taking most of the sky above you shortly.

753
00:31:30.765 --> 00:31:33.181
TALIESIN: Are we going to be fighting against it or are we,

754
00:31:33.181 --> 00:31:34.577
are we going to be-- is it traveling

755
00:31:34.577 --> 00:31:37.005
the same direction we that we are?

756
00:31:37.005 --> 00:31:38.505
MATT: Looks like it's going to be against you,

757
00:31:38.505 --> 00:31:40.997
so it will pass quicker it seems.

758
00:31:40.997 --> 00:31:42.513
TALIESIN: Nice.

759
00:31:42.513 --> 00:31:43.545
Just a little rain.

760
00:31:43.545 --> 00:31:46.113
MARISHA: Are we still-- is the landscape still

761
00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:49.397
almost like a flat, like a salt flat type of thing?

762
00:31:49.397 --> 00:31:50.547
MATT: Similar, yeah.

763
00:31:50.547 --> 00:31:52.517
It's a dried and cracked badlands.

764
00:31:52.517 --> 00:31:56.417
You had a faint bit of rain day before,

765
00:31:56.417 --> 00:31:58.457
it caused some of it to mud and muck up,

766
00:31:58.457 --> 00:32:01.053
but it was very, very minor.

767
00:32:01.053 --> 00:32:03.137
LIAM: Still scattered with these giant--

768
00:32:03.137 --> 00:32:06.887
MATT: Spires, these rock formations that are

769
00:32:08.325 --> 00:32:11.265
made of stone that is not natural to this,

770
00:32:11.265 --> 00:32:13.893
to the rest of the plains around you.

771
00:32:13.893 --> 00:32:15.645
TRAVIS: And it's like flat as the eye can see right?

772
00:32:15.645 --> 00:32:18.978
We're not on any sort of a slow ravine?

773
00:32:20.373 --> 00:32:21.976
MATT: The terrain does shift and move

774
00:32:21.976 --> 00:32:24.885
and there are craters, there are a large chasms

775
00:32:24.885 --> 00:32:27.301
and holes in here that appear to, some of them,

776
00:32:27.301 --> 00:32:30.354
through a blasted force that eventually just fell back in,

777
00:32:30.354 --> 00:32:32.912
some, the earth just is torn open in places.

778
00:32:32.912 --> 00:32:34.653
TALIESIN: It's like Beetlejuice limbo without the red

779
00:32:34.653 --> 00:32:36.288
filter is the vibe I'm getting.

780
00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:37.886
MATT: Sure, yeah.
TALIESIN: Cool, all right, I'm in.

781
00:32:37.886 --> 00:32:40.316
TRAVIS: I'm thinking sort of like flash flood.

782
00:32:40.316 --> 00:32:42.343
TALIESIN: It might get muddy.

783
00:32:42.343 --> 00:32:43.558
MATT: It's probably going to get muddy.

784
00:32:43.558 --> 00:32:44.899
LAURA: I wonder if it's going to be like the playa

785
00:32:44.899 --> 00:32:46.001
where it gets like--

786
00:32:46.001 --> 00:32:46.886
MARISHA: Cakey muddy.

787
00:32:46.886 --> 00:32:48.752
It's going to suck!

788
00:32:49.738 --> 00:32:50.571
TALIESIN: Oh no.

789
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:51.744
MARISHA: Yeah.

790
00:32:51.744 --> 00:32:53.154
SAM: Let's mount up!

791
00:32:53.154 --> 00:32:54.270
TRAVIS: Difficult terrain.
MARISHA: Yeah.

792
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.545
MATT: Looking around, your moorbounders haven't returned yet

793
00:32:56.545 --> 00:32:57.949
from their evening hunt.

794
00:32:57.949 --> 00:32:59.497
LAURA: Oh no.

795
00:32:59.497 --> 00:33:01.223
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

796
00:33:01.223 --> 00:33:02.707
LAURA: Yarnball!

797
00:33:02.707 --> 00:33:03.657
SAM: Jannik!

798
00:33:03.657 --> 00:33:06.658
LIAM: I throw Frumpkin up into the air

799
00:33:06.658 --> 00:33:07.491
in vulture form--
TRAVIS: The cat?

800
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:08.494
LIAM: -- to have a look around.

801
00:33:08.494 --> 00:33:10.418
MARISHA, TRAVIS, and LIAM: (meowing)

802
00:33:10.418 --> 00:33:15.186
MATT: About about a quarter mile up and away from you guys,

803
00:33:15.186 --> 00:33:17.936
Frumpkin sees them first, but the--

804
00:33:18.818 --> 00:33:21.996
your three moorbounders had found shelter

805
00:33:21.996 --> 00:33:23.078
for the evening for their rest.

806
00:33:23.078 --> 00:33:24.772
Since they went out hunting, I guess,

807
00:33:24.772 --> 00:33:26.961
and didn't make their way back to the dome.

808
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:31.111
What your bird sees, your vulture,

809
00:33:32.645 --> 00:33:36.442
is some sort of strange dome

810
00:33:36.442 --> 00:33:38.482
about 50 feet across end to end.

811
00:33:38.482 --> 00:33:41.195
It looks like a large brown, smooth stone

812
00:33:41.195 --> 00:33:44.570
with some strange holes in the sides.

813
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.403
LIAM: Where they are?

814
00:33:45.403 --> 00:33:46.236
Where the moorbounders are?
MATT: Where they are.

815
00:33:46.236 --> 00:33:47.237
You see one of the moorbounders

816
00:33:47.237 --> 00:33:49.954
creep out into the morning light

817
00:33:49.954 --> 00:33:52.229
diffused by the cloud cover,

818
00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:55.362
curling, licking its two bulbous fish like eyes

819
00:33:55.362 --> 00:33:58.261
on the sides of its face.

820
00:33:58.261 --> 00:33:59.717
Looks like it's coming to consciousness and curling out.

821
00:33:59.717 --> 00:34:01.067
The other two eventually emerge

822
00:34:01.067 --> 00:34:03.092
from the inside of this rock.

823
00:34:04.397 --> 00:34:07.564
You take a moment to recognize, this is--

824
00:34:08.668 --> 00:34:12.018
the shape of it is very bone like.

825
00:34:13.224 --> 00:34:14.399
It's a shell.

826
00:34:15.568 --> 00:34:16.724
LAURA: From the big turtle!

827
00:34:16.724 --> 00:34:18.776
MATT: This appears to be the

828
00:34:18.776 --> 00:34:23.567
the long-dried, hollowed corpse shell

829
00:34:23.567 --> 00:34:26.084
of one of the horizonback tortoises

830
00:34:26.084 --> 00:34:28.304
that has partially fallen and

831
00:34:28.304 --> 00:34:30.148
taken back by the plains and was used as

832
00:34:30.148 --> 00:34:31.736
a temporary shelter for the evening.

833
00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:32.684
LAURA: That's so cool.

834
00:34:32.684 --> 00:34:35.876
ASHLEY: So cool.
TRAVIS: How do we take that with us?

835
00:34:35.876 --> 00:34:37.511
LAURA: Will it fit in the Bag of Holding?

836
00:34:37.511 --> 00:34:38.428
MATT: 50 by 50 feet?

837
00:34:38.428 --> 00:34:40.253
Yeah, I think so.

838
00:34:40.253 --> 00:34:41.761
TRAVIS: 50 by 50.

839
00:34:41.761 --> 00:34:42.886
MATT: Yeah, big tortoise.

840
00:34:42.886 --> 00:34:43.719
LIAM: I relay that to the party.

841
00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.190
Do you want to go to them?

842
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.059
SAM: Yeah, let's go to them.

843
00:34:46.059 --> 00:34:46.946
LAURA: It's on the way right?

844
00:34:46.946 --> 00:34:48.429
MATT: Yeah, a little off to the right,

845
00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.804
but you can swerve over there.
ASHLEY: We gotta see that.

846
00:34:50.804 --> 00:34:53.698
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.
ASHLEY: That's a sight to see.

847
00:34:53.698 --> 00:34:57.427
MATT: You guys manage to catch up towards your moorbounders.

848
00:34:57.427 --> 00:34:59.278
Soon as they see you in the distance catching up

849
00:34:59.278 --> 00:35:02.578
and they run up and start getting, you know,

850
00:35:02.578 --> 00:35:05.290
rambunctious and excited to see you

851
00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.373
conscious and moving. What do you do?

852
00:35:10.286 --> 00:35:13.195
TALIESIN: I'm going to going to just calm Clarabelle down

853
00:35:13.195 --> 00:35:14.814
and I think I'm going to head over

854
00:35:14.814 --> 00:35:16.182
and take a look at the shell,

855
00:35:16.182 --> 00:35:18.042
get a better look at this thing.

856
00:35:18.042 --> 00:35:18.986
LIAM: I'm curious, I'll go.

857
00:35:18.986 --> 00:35:21.086
I think it was probably safe if they were in there.

858
00:35:21.086 --> 00:35:24.814
LAURA: I'm going to jump around with Yarnball for a while.

859
00:35:24.814 --> 00:35:25.986
TALIESIN: Let's all stay in--

860
00:35:25.986 --> 00:35:29.854
let's all stay in eyesight of each other.

861
00:35:29.854 --> 00:35:31.162
MARISHA: I'll join them going in.

862
00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:32.553
SAM: I'm going to go to the roof.

863
00:35:32.553 --> 00:35:34.686
Are there any holes in the roof?

864
00:35:34.686 --> 00:35:35.519
MATT: Make a perception check.

865
00:35:35.519 --> 00:35:37.726
MARISHA: Can you climb it like a big jungle gym?

866
00:35:37.726 --> 00:35:39.634
TRAVIS: Half-dome?
SAM: 12.

867
00:35:39.634 --> 00:35:41.645
MATT: 12, you don't see any like large holes,

868
00:35:41.645 --> 00:35:46.025
but the nature of the structure of the shell itself,

869
00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:49.070
the hard exoskeleton aspect of it

870
00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.185
is ridged and easy to climb.

871
00:35:51.185 --> 00:35:52.313
SAM: Okay, I'll climb.

872
00:35:52.313 --> 00:35:53.557
MATT: All right, so you get on top of it,

873
00:35:53.557 --> 00:35:55.053
and you can now, if you want to,

874
00:35:55.053 --> 00:35:56.797
climb towards the apex of the shell

875
00:35:56.797 --> 00:36:00.953
which stands about, I'd say, 30, 25 to 30 feet

876
00:36:00.953 --> 00:36:03.397
off the ground, although it's sunken in by five feet,

877
00:36:03.397 --> 00:36:06.953
so probably about 20 to 25 feet at its apex.

878
00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:07.971
LAURA: Be careful, Nott.

879
00:36:07.971 --> 00:36:09.233
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

880
00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:11.983
TALIESIN: The had this installation last year.

881
00:36:11.983 --> 00:36:13.372
MATT: A cool view from up there.

882
00:36:13.372 --> 00:36:16.073
SAM: Are there any cracks to see like down into the--

883
00:36:16.073 --> 00:36:18.261
any cracks in the shell or is it all--?

884
00:36:18.261 --> 00:36:20.037
MATT: No, the shell is solid.

885
00:36:20.037 --> 00:36:24.331
It is a hardy creature.

886
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:25.710
But you have a unique-- make a perception check

887
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:26.929
from on top of the shell.

888
00:36:26.929 --> 00:36:29.192
SAM: Okay, 19.

889
00:36:29.192 --> 00:36:30.025
MATT: 19?

890
00:36:32.672 --> 00:36:34.665
All right.

891
00:36:34.665 --> 00:36:37.501
All right. Because the rain hasn't come yet,

892
00:36:37.501 --> 00:36:40.893
you do have a decent view on the horizon.

893
00:36:40.893 --> 00:36:44.836
Though you get the sense the storm isn't that far off.

894
00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:48.093
You do see a unique shape that catches your attention

895
00:36:48.093 --> 00:36:51.136
in the direction of where you guys are traveling,

896
00:36:51.136 --> 00:36:53.133
a towering shape.

897
00:36:53.133 --> 00:36:57.705
A shadowed plume atop a wide spire.

898
00:36:57.705 --> 00:37:00.513
It resembles a tree, but the size and distance

899
00:37:00.513 --> 00:37:03.797
is hard to gauge through the

900
00:37:03.797 --> 00:37:05.417
dust and wind that's blowing in

901
00:37:05.417 --> 00:37:07.157
with the coming storm.

902
00:37:07.157 --> 00:37:09.177
SAM: A tree on top of a spire?

903
00:37:09.177 --> 00:37:10.094
TRAVIS: The shape of a tree.

904
00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:11.745
MATT: It looks almost like a tree,

905
00:37:11.745 --> 00:37:14.775
it's just large shape and like a spire.

906
00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:15.901
Like you can barely make it out

907
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:18.681
and it's quite a ways away.

908
00:37:18.681 --> 00:37:22.163
It's probably another day's journey to even get there.

909
00:37:22.163 --> 00:37:24.171
SAM: Okay. Good to know.

910
00:37:24.171 --> 00:37:25.520
MATT: But you rolled a 19 on your perception check,

911
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.969
so you sort of caught your vision,

912
00:37:26.969 --> 00:37:28.905
you're like that's-- you're not sure quite how far it is,

913
00:37:28.905 --> 00:37:29.941
but it looks pretty big.

914
00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:32.032
TRAVIS: Is that in the general direction we are heading?

915
00:37:32.032 --> 00:37:33.248
SAM: Yes.

916
00:37:34.748 --> 00:37:37.356
LIAM: When we go in I would tell Frumpkin to

917
00:37:37.356 --> 00:37:41.389
circle like a police helicopter and to cry out if anything--

918
00:37:41.389 --> 00:37:42.807
if he sees anything.

919
00:37:42.807 --> 00:37:44.512
MATT: You got it.

920
00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:49.262
Go ahead and roll a perception check for Frumpkin, please.

921
00:37:50.192 --> 00:37:51.692
LIAM: Shite.

922
00:37:51.692 --> 00:37:53.767
Extra, vulture.

923
00:37:55.104 --> 00:37:56.544
That'd be 11.

924
00:37:56.544 --> 00:37:57.888
MATT: 11, good to know.

925
00:37:57.888 --> 00:38:00.264
All right, the rest of you make your way towards

926
00:38:00.264 --> 00:38:02.189
the empty interior of the shell.

927
00:38:02.189 --> 00:38:03.673
TALIESIN: I can light it up a little bit.

928
00:38:03.673 --> 00:38:05.454
MATT: As Caduceus lights up the inside,

929
00:38:05.454 --> 00:38:09.585
you can see it is a large domed cavern.

930
00:38:09.585 --> 00:38:13.393
You can see where the spinal cord is fused

931
00:38:13.393 --> 00:38:15.225
in sections along the upper ridge,

932
00:38:15.225 --> 00:38:19.425
creating this unique, beautiful, macabre arch

933
00:38:19.425 --> 00:38:20.341
from end to end.

934
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:22.288
You can see the multiple holes where the

935
00:38:22.288 --> 00:38:24.793
arms and legs and head and tail of this thing

936
00:38:24.793 --> 00:38:26.546
would've emerged, though they're about half crescents

937
00:38:26.546 --> 00:38:29.893
as the bottom half has been retaken by the land around it.

938
00:38:29.893 --> 00:38:32.236
This has been here for a while.

939
00:38:33.086 --> 00:38:34.949
You catch out from the inside that

940
00:38:34.949 --> 00:38:38.591
pockets of it seem to be growing

941
00:38:39.673 --> 00:38:42.885
bits of fuzzy plant matter.

942
00:38:42.885 --> 00:38:44.488
Some of it could be fungus, some of it could be moss,

943
00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:45.661
you're not sure.

944
00:38:45.661 --> 00:38:48.121
But there seems to be almost like a small ecosystem

945
00:38:48.121 --> 00:38:51.241
that's developed within the inside of this shell.

946
00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:52.841
You also find

947
00:38:54.779 --> 00:38:59.774
the corpse of two orcs torn asunder and half eaten.

948
00:38:59.774 --> 00:39:00.607
Freshly.

949
00:39:02.893 --> 00:39:05.060
MARISHA: They got some orcs, wow.

950
00:39:05.985 --> 00:39:08.805
MATT: Fresh enough from the past few hours.

951
00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:11.893
LIAM: Is there any clothing left to root through?

952
00:39:11.893 --> 00:39:14.205
MATT: There is destroyed hide armor,

953
00:39:14.205 --> 00:39:17.729
not functional, with some repair it can be done.

954
00:39:17.729 --> 00:39:20.062
But fair hides, thick hides.

955
00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:24.792
Looks to be two handaxes on one of them

956
00:39:24.792 --> 00:39:27.146
and the other one had a long sword

957
00:39:27.146 --> 00:39:29.580
and a leather shield.

958
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.842
MARISHA: I wonder what they were doing out here.

959
00:39:31.842 --> 00:39:34.753
MATT: They both have longbows on them

960
00:39:34.753 --> 00:39:37.012
and a total of, let's say,

961
00:39:37.012 --> 00:39:39.845
22 arrows between the two of them.

962
00:39:41.032 --> 00:39:42.365
They look to be--

963
00:39:43.502 --> 00:39:46.176
they don't have a lot of equipment.

964
00:39:46.176 --> 00:39:48.440
Looks like they're mainly carrying enough things

965
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.607
to keep themself alive and to move so--

966
00:39:52.664 --> 00:39:57.244
make a survival check, anybody who would like to try to.

967
00:39:57.244 --> 00:39:59.177
TALIESIN: I've got a little bit of that.

968
00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:02.864
LIAM: 21.
TALIESIN: 22.

969
00:40:02.864 --> 00:40:03.864
MATT: Nice.
ASHLEY: 18.

970
00:40:05.488 --> 00:40:06.508
MATT: 18, still pretty good.

971
00:40:06.508 --> 00:40:11.341
All right, so you three looking at the equipment they have,

972
00:40:12.628 --> 00:40:17.472
where you are, you gather these two are probably scouts.

973
00:40:17.472 --> 00:40:21.596
They're not dressed in attire that seem congruent

974
00:40:21.596 --> 00:40:24.852
with Rosohna or orcs you've met and seen in the Dynasty

975
00:40:24.852 --> 00:40:26.827
and they are full blooded orcs.

976
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:30.177
And they're a mess.

977
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.532
But it seems at least your moorbounders

978
00:40:32.532 --> 00:40:35.576
went and found some food for the night.

979
00:40:35.576 --> 00:40:36.595
TALIESIN: Any other signs of any other people

980
00:40:36.595 --> 00:40:40.393
who have maybe camped underneath this thing before?

981
00:40:40.393 --> 00:40:41.587
Any disturbed earth?

982
00:40:41.587 --> 00:40:42.939
MATT: Make an investigation check.

983
00:40:42.939 --> 00:40:44.356
TALIESIN: Oh, my favorites.

984
00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:50.095
That's a natural one minus one.

985
00:40:50.095 --> 00:40:52.299
So I think I'm just going to collect some samples.

986
00:40:52.299 --> 00:40:54.559
I'm going to stare at the moss, I suppose.

987
00:40:54.559 --> 00:40:56.567
MATT: Yeah, yes, it's really soft.

988
00:40:56.567 --> 00:40:57.484
TALIESIN: God damn.

989
00:41:04.927 --> 00:41:06.923
MARISHA: Anything else, any like--

990
00:41:06.923 --> 00:41:08.200
if this has been there for a while,

991
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.216
any carvings, any graffiti on the shell

992
00:41:11.216 --> 00:41:15.080
anything stand out?
MATT: Make a perception check.

993
00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.759
MARISHA: Not investigation?

994
00:41:16.759 --> 00:41:18.059
MATT: There's a difference between

995
00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:20.708
looking about the interior for signs.

996
00:41:20.708 --> 00:41:22.453
MARISHA: Oh that's good, though, 21.

997
00:41:22.453 --> 00:41:24.636
MATT: 21, that's actually really good.

998
00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:30.520
You see a few sections that have carvings on them.

999
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.691
Rudimentary, one of them looks like it's a series of

1000
00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:37.623
dug-in dots and lines in locations

1001
00:41:37.623 --> 00:41:39.927
and you gather it almost looks like

1002
00:41:39.927 --> 00:41:41.643
a simple map of the valley.

1003
00:41:41.643 --> 00:41:42.477
MARISHA: Oh.

1004
00:41:42.477 --> 00:41:45.661
But there's no language, it's just markings.

1005
00:41:45.661 --> 00:41:48.569
It's like seeing a carved

1006
00:41:50.843 --> 00:41:52.277
constellation.

1007
00:41:52.277 --> 00:41:53.618
MARISHA: Does my criminal background

1008
00:41:53.618 --> 00:41:55.201
clue me in a little bit more

1009
00:41:55.201 --> 00:41:56.426
that's what it is?

1010
00:41:56.426 --> 00:41:58.058
MATT: You've seen things like this yeah,

1011
00:41:58.058 --> 00:42:00.414
and it's usually designed to be a code for

1012
00:42:00.414 --> 00:42:02.289
people that pass through.

1013
00:42:03.306 --> 00:42:04.139
MARISHA: What does it look--

1014
00:42:04.139 --> 00:42:06.486
is there something that looks like--

1015
00:42:06.486 --> 00:42:08.078
could be marked as--

1016
00:42:08.078 --> 00:42:12.818
raz, razzes, bazz, ratatatatazan.

1017
00:42:12.818 --> 00:42:14.485
MATT: Bazzoxan?
MARISHA: Bazzoxan!

1018
00:42:16.263 --> 00:42:19.823
MATT: You can see a carving that looks to be

1019
00:42:19.823 --> 00:42:22.156
an oblong strange perimeter.

1020
00:42:23.651 --> 00:42:27.984
There's a marking, a carving that looks like--

1021
00:42:28.821 --> 00:42:31.854
almost like a T, like a thick topped T,

1022
00:42:31.854 --> 00:42:33.802
you can see a marking that seems to be like a circle

1023
00:42:33.802 --> 00:42:35.275
with a couple of lines through it.

1024
00:42:35.275 --> 00:42:38.198
You can see a number of other dots

1025
00:42:38.198 --> 00:42:40.599
that you're uncertain what their element means.

1026
00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:43.486
The circle seems to be the shell that you're in.

1027
00:42:43.486 --> 00:42:44.735
LIAM: What is this, what are you looking at?

1028
00:42:44.735 --> 00:42:46.737
MARISHA: Hey Jester, come here.

1029
00:42:46.737 --> 00:42:48.019
LAURA: Mm-hmm!
LIAM: What is that?

1030
00:42:48.019 --> 00:42:51.732
MARISHA: I think it's a map of the area.

1031
00:42:51.732 --> 00:42:53.986
I think this little circle thing

1032
00:42:53.986 --> 00:42:55.903
is like a "you are here."

1033
00:42:57.369 --> 00:43:01.202
And I think these are just landmarks.

1034
00:43:02.125 --> 00:43:03.739
You know, people try to communicate to each other,

1035
00:43:03.739 --> 00:43:05.048
smugglers maybe?

1036
00:43:05.048 --> 00:43:07.752
LAURA: I take out my sketchbook and I draw it.

1037
00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:10.043
MATT: Yeah, you're not certain what these mean necessarily,

1038
00:43:10.043 --> 00:43:12.983
but you're just-- you gather the essence

1039
00:43:12.983 --> 00:43:14.271
of what it was used for.

1040
00:43:14.271 --> 00:43:15.104
MARISHA: Cool.

1041
00:43:16.819 --> 00:43:17.652
LIAM: I'm going to spend the next minute

1042
00:43:17.652 --> 00:43:19.574
to take out my pearl,

1043
00:43:19.574 --> 00:43:23.293
and give myself a dose of Fortune's Favor.

1044
00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:27.047
And when that is up, I am going to send Frumpkin

1045
00:43:27.047 --> 00:43:28.797
very high in the sky,

1046
00:43:30.296 --> 00:43:32.647
and plant my hand on Beauregard's shoulder

1047
00:43:32.647 --> 00:43:35.550
and try to look for more of these orcs

1048
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:39.119
anywhere on the plains around this place.

1049
00:43:39.119 --> 00:43:41.150
MATT: Right, okay, Frumpkin is doing so.

1050
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:44.508
LIAM: Oh, no, but-- does it change when I look?

1051
00:43:44.508 --> 00:43:46.800
Because currently I told Frumpkin he is to look

1052
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.218
and just squawk if he sees anything.

1053
00:43:49.218 --> 00:43:50.759
MATT: It's a continuation of

1054
00:43:50.759 --> 00:43:52.542
searching for things in the area.

1055
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:53.375
LIAM: All right, well I'll still keep the

1056
00:43:53.375 --> 00:43:55.041
luck point.
TALIESIN: At the very least,

1057
00:43:55.041 --> 00:43:56.132
maybe covering our tracks

1058
00:43:56.132 --> 00:43:58.949
on the way out might not be a bad idea.

1059
00:43:58.949 --> 00:43:59.960
LAURA: Ooh, good call.

1060
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.287
TRAVIS: Won't the rain do that?

1061
00:44:02.287 --> 00:44:03.787
LAURA: But not in here.

1062
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:09.340
MATT: You do see a couple of dark spots on the floor

1063
00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.163
in different areas where it looks like some of the

1064
00:44:11.163 --> 00:44:16.012
the dust and the dirt is blackened and charcoaled

1065
00:44:16.012 --> 00:44:17.934
where fires may have been built.

1066
00:44:17.934 --> 00:44:20.524
And because of the protected interior of the shell,

1067
00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:23.079
the erosion and the wind that normally sweeps through

1068
00:44:23.079 --> 00:44:26.684
hasn't entirely covered and erased that presence.

1069
00:44:26.684 --> 00:44:28.924
So the shell definitely seems to see traffic

1070
00:44:28.924 --> 00:44:30.507
every now and then.

1071
00:44:31.617 --> 00:44:33.932
LAURA: We should get moving if we want to keep ahead of--

1072
00:44:33.932 --> 00:44:35.682
TALIESIN: That's a good idea.

1073
00:44:36.836 --> 00:44:37.669
All right.

1074
00:44:39.569 --> 00:44:41.720
SAM: I'm going to slide down the--

1075
00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.999
slide down the turtle shell.

1076
00:44:42.999 --> 00:44:46.874
MATT: You hear (sliding)
SAM: Whee!

1077
00:44:46.874 --> 00:44:48.107
(impact)

1078
00:44:49.553 --> 00:44:50.476
Are we going?

1079
00:44:50.476 --> 00:44:51.976
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Let's go!

1080
00:44:53.403 --> 00:44:55.165
SAM: Oh, also about a day ahead of us,

1081
00:44:55.165 --> 00:44:56.604
there's this crazy big thing.

1082
00:44:56.604 --> 00:44:58.303
LAURA: What kind of big thing?

1083
00:44:58.303 --> 00:44:59.367
SAM: I don't know, it's a big thing.

1084
00:44:59.367 --> 00:45:00.200
LIAM: Like a creature?
LAURA: Like what?

1085
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.182
SAM: No, like a big tower or a tree.

1086
00:45:03.182 --> 00:45:05.443
LAURA: Did you see any of those big, like,

1087
00:45:05.443 --> 00:45:08.073
things that are gray and have like four eyes

1088
00:45:08.073 --> 00:45:10.432
and like big arms, like we saw on the other plains?

1089
00:45:10.432 --> 00:45:11.484
SAM: No, no.

1090
00:45:11.484 --> 00:45:13.323
LAURA: Because me and Yasha saw one of those last night.

1091
00:45:13.323 --> 00:45:15.851
ASHLEY: Last night.
SAM: I didn't, no.

1092
00:45:15.851 --> 00:45:17.694
LIAM: Which direction is this tree or tower?

1093
00:45:17.694 --> 00:45:19.866
SAM: The way we're going.

1094
00:45:19.866 --> 00:45:21.174
That way.

1095
00:45:21.174 --> 00:45:24.326
LIAM: Well, we'll find out soon enough then.

1096
00:45:24.326 --> 00:45:26.103
MATT: Are you heading towards this shape?

1097
00:45:26.103 --> 00:45:27.993
LIAM: Is it the same direction we're headed?

1098
00:45:27.993 --> 00:45:30.685
MATT: Loosely. You don't have a specific idea

1099
00:45:30.685 --> 00:45:32.613
of, you know, a pinpointed radar,

1100
00:45:32.613 --> 00:45:34.115
but you know you're heading north.

1101
00:45:34.115 --> 00:45:35.221
TRAVIS: We're going that way now.

1102
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:37.283
MATT: Like north, northwest.

1103
00:45:37.283 --> 00:45:38.612
You have the map.

1104
00:45:38.612 --> 00:45:41.484
That's for you guys whoever wants to--

1105
00:45:41.484 --> 00:45:44.860
SAM: Do we have any sense of where we are on the map?

1106
00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.033
LAURA: Within the Fields?

1107
00:45:47.033 --> 00:45:48.799
TALIESIN: One day's travel from the--

1108
00:45:48.799 --> 00:45:50.003
ASHLEY: Trying to go up to--

1109
00:45:50.003 --> 00:45:51.930
TALIESIN: So three days--

1110
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.573
MATT: At this point, you're almost

1111
00:45:53.573 --> 00:45:55.503
to the halfway point. You're roughly at the halfway point.

1112
00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:57.793
TALIESIN: We're at that bloodstain right there.

1113
00:45:57.793 --> 00:46:00.486
LIAM: I feel like with Caleb's weird sense of direction

1114
00:46:00.486 --> 00:46:02.351
and the map they'd have a decent idea.

1115
00:46:02.351 --> 00:46:03.507
MATT: You have a decent idea.

1116
00:46:03.507 --> 00:46:05.507
It's not perfect, though.

1117
00:46:08.213 --> 00:46:10.089
SAM: Do you see any towers on the map?

1118
00:46:10.089 --> 00:46:12.413
TALIESIN: Weird question, do I recognize the weird language

1119
00:46:12.413 --> 00:46:14.580
that's written on the map?

1120
00:46:15.989 --> 00:46:17.902
LIAM: Caleb deciphered all of those.

1121
00:46:17.902 --> 00:46:19.260
TALIESIN: We've already been through that. Sorry.

1122
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.723
Yeah, that's not going to-- nevermind.

1123
00:46:20.723 --> 00:46:22.056
MATT: It's all good.

1124
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.582
TALIESIN: It's so fancy.
SAM: On we go!

1125
00:46:24.582 --> 00:46:25.712
MATT: You gather your moorbounders,

1126
00:46:25.712 --> 00:46:27.326
you pick back on the trail,

1127
00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:29.038
and you continue heading northward

1128
00:46:29.038 --> 00:46:31.681
through the Barbed Fields.

1129
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:32.927
Who's making point on this?

1130
00:46:32.927 --> 00:46:34.642
I just want to know what the marching order is

1131
00:46:34.642 --> 00:46:36.927
going forward.
TALIESIN: I'll take front.

1132
00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:40.320
MATT: Got Caduceus in the front with your moorbounder.

1133
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.504
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm with Caduceus.

1134
00:46:43.504 --> 00:46:46.421
LAURA: Me and Fjord will be in the middle.

1135
00:46:46.421 --> 00:46:47.254
ASHLEY: Regulators!

1136
00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.118
TRAVIS: Mount up!

1137
00:46:50.118 --> 00:46:52.134
♪ It was a clear black night, a clear white moon, ♪

1138
00:46:52.134 --> 00:46:54.950
♪ Warren G was in the streets, carrying to consume. ♪

1139
00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.390
MARISHA: Get it.
MATT: Beau--

1140
00:46:59.746 --> 00:47:01.142
SAM: Caleb and Nott.

1141
00:47:01.142 --> 00:47:05.019
MATT: Caleb and Nott right there, you got it, okay.

1142
00:47:05.019 --> 00:47:06.816
As you guys continue riding forward

1143
00:47:06.816 --> 00:47:08.108
for the next couple hours,

1144
00:47:08.108 --> 00:47:09.578
Caduceus, since you are at point,

1145
00:47:09.578 --> 00:47:11.623
with you and Yasha, if you would both like to

1146
00:47:11.623 --> 00:47:13.114
make perception checks as you continue forward.

1147
00:47:13.114 --> 00:47:15.405
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, because I do that.

1148
00:47:15.405 --> 00:47:16.238
It's a thing.

1149
00:47:18.404 --> 00:47:19.679
15.

1150
00:47:19.679 --> 00:47:21.451
ASHLEY: Ooh, that's a natural one.

1151
00:47:21.451 --> 00:47:22.980
MATT: Ew.

1152
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.845
Okay.
TRAVIS, SAM, and ASHLEY: Ew.

1153
00:47:25.845 --> 00:47:28.530
You continue moving forward, passing by

1154
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.769
clusters of these spires.

1155
00:47:30.769 --> 00:47:33.100
It seems the further toward the center you get

1156
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.450
of this area, those large stone shapes

1157
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:39.200
can get more and more dense.

1158
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.812
Where you'd see one every mile to every half mile,

1159
00:47:42.812 --> 00:47:45.083
the further in you've gotten you'll see,

1160
00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:48.003
you know, two or three within visible distance

1161
00:47:48.003 --> 00:47:51.681
to seeing two within a few hundred feet of each other,

1162
00:47:51.681 --> 00:47:53.938
occasionally and they seem to get more dense

1163
00:47:53.938 --> 00:47:55.352
the further into the Fields you get.

1164
00:47:55.352 --> 00:47:56.651
They don't seem to be like

1165
00:47:56.651 --> 00:47:58.471
becoming a forest of them necessarily,

1166
00:47:58.471 --> 00:48:00.621
but just less--

1167
00:48:01.708 --> 00:48:03.353
less sparse.

1168
00:48:03.353 --> 00:48:05.703
LAURA: Keeping an eye out for any of those

1169
00:48:05.703 --> 00:48:07.568
wiley guys we saw.

1170
00:48:07.568 --> 00:48:08.401
MATT: Okay.

1171
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:10.970
I will say

1172
00:48:13.956 --> 00:48:17.964
Caduceus, you at the front

1173
00:48:17.964 --> 00:48:20.204
and based on your passive perception,

1174
00:48:20.204 --> 00:48:22.710
about three and a half to four hours,

1175
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:26.943
getting closer to the mid-day, little past noon,

1176
00:48:26.943 --> 00:48:28.936
you look forward and see

1177
00:48:28.936 --> 00:48:30.853
another round shape.

1178
00:48:33.821 --> 00:48:35.763
TALIESIN: Is it the same approximate size and color

1179
00:48:35.763 --> 00:48:37.096
of what we were--

1180
00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.700
what we were used to with the turtle?

1181
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.759
MATT: It looks a little darker, but at this point

1182
00:48:42.759 --> 00:48:45.909
you can also see-- the rain hasn't hit you yet,

1183
00:48:45.909 --> 00:48:48.610
but you can see that gray blanket of distant rain

1184
00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.570
that's now starting to blur the horizon

1185
00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.397
and is making its way in your direction.

1186
00:48:52.397 --> 00:48:54.196
ASHLEY: We should get shelter.

1187
00:48:54.196 --> 00:48:56.124
TALIESIN: Yeah, there may be another turtle up ahead too

1188
00:48:56.124 --> 00:48:59.706
and maybe a live one too, I can't quite tell.

1189
00:48:59.706 --> 00:49:03.417
MARISHA: I reference the map that Jester copied.

1190
00:49:03.417 --> 00:49:06.799
Does it look, based on-- like there's something

1191
00:49:06.799 --> 00:49:09.133
related on the map?

1192
00:49:09.133 --> 00:49:09.966
Shell?

1193
00:49:09.966 --> 00:49:10.799
MATT: No.

1194
00:49:11.985 --> 00:49:14.122
MARISHA: This thing's garbage.

1195
00:49:14.122 --> 00:49:17.272
TALIESIN: Is the shell moving or is it not moving?

1196
00:49:17.272 --> 00:49:18.332
MATT: Doesn't appear to be moving.

1197
00:49:18.332 --> 00:49:20.175
As you're bounding towards it you get

1198
00:49:20.175 --> 00:49:23.247
a little bit of a better look.

1199
00:49:23.247 --> 00:49:25.453
It's about 20 or so feet high now,

1200
00:49:25.453 --> 00:49:28.165
about 150 feet from you as you glance over

1201
00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:29.336
and get a better view.

1202
00:49:29.336 --> 00:49:30.475
TALIESIN: Let's slow everyone down a little bit.

1203
00:49:30.475 --> 00:49:33.063
MATT: Okay, you guys slow down a little bit.

1204
00:49:33.063 --> 00:49:37.645
You can now see the details of matted fur,

1205
00:49:37.645 --> 00:49:41.988
the muscular back legs, the four burly arms

1206
00:49:41.988 --> 00:49:43.738
and you recognize this is the same creature,

1207
00:49:43.738 --> 00:49:45.208
the udaak that you have seen before.

1208
00:49:45.208 --> 00:49:46.626
Though it is lying on its side

1209
00:49:46.626 --> 00:49:48.035
and is not moving.

1210
00:49:48.035 --> 00:49:49.394
SAM: Not moving or not breathing?

1211
00:49:49.394 --> 00:49:50.477
MATT: Not moving.

1212
00:49:51.437 --> 00:49:54.308
TALIESIN: We are, I think, going to go around this thing.

1213
00:49:54.308 --> 00:49:55.903
I think would be a--

1214
00:49:55.903 --> 00:49:58.842
wide berth might be a good idea.

1215
00:49:58.842 --> 00:50:00.292
SAM: What if it can help us?

1216
00:50:00.292 --> 00:50:01.536
Give us directions?

1217
00:50:01.536 --> 00:50:03.142
TALIESIN: You can-- yeah, no.

1218
00:50:03.142 --> 00:50:04.947
I think that's a bad idea.

1219
00:50:04.947 --> 00:50:07.225
SAM: If it's asleep, we can kill it quite easily.

1220
00:50:07.225 --> 00:50:08.345
LAURA: I don't think we could.

1221
00:50:08.345 --> 00:50:10.496
I think if we try to kill it while it was sleeping

1222
00:50:10.496 --> 00:50:13.035
it might wake up and then it would kill us.

1223
00:50:13.035 --> 00:50:14.818
TALIESIN: I think we can just walk around it.

1224
00:50:14.818 --> 00:50:16.675
It seems to be the smarter thing to do.

1225
00:50:16.675 --> 00:50:18.756
ASHLEY: I would agree. I say we walk around.

1226
00:50:18.756 --> 00:50:20.906
SAM: I've been drinking most of the morning, so.

1227
00:50:20.906 --> 00:50:22.868
LAURA: Nott!

1228
00:50:22.868 --> 00:50:23.745
Really?

1229
00:50:23.745 --> 00:50:24.745
SAM: Yeah, baby.

1230
00:50:26.873 --> 00:50:27.706
LAURA: Okay.

1231
00:50:28.804 --> 00:50:33.143
MATT: All right, moving around keeping a wide berth on it.

1232
00:50:33.143 --> 00:50:36.121
Both of you make a perception check in the front.

1233
00:50:39.087 --> 00:50:40.854
TALIESIN: That's better, 17.

1234
00:50:41.989 --> 00:50:42.847
ASHLEY: Nine.

1235
00:50:42.847 --> 00:50:44.413
MATT: All right, 17.

1236
00:50:44.413 --> 00:50:45.741
ASHLEY: Nine.

1237
00:50:45.741 --> 00:50:48.020
MATT: You begin to notice that parts of its body

1238
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:51.437
seem to be showing gaping wounds.

1239
00:50:52.412 --> 00:50:53.245
Open,

1240
00:50:54.682 --> 00:50:56.482
exposed flesh.

1241
00:50:56.482 --> 00:50:58.279
TALIESIN: Detect undead.

1242
00:50:58.279 --> 00:51:00.232
Eyes of the Grave.

1243
00:51:00.232 --> 00:51:01.460
MATT: The range on that is--?

1244
00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.326
TALIESIN: Not far enough away.
MATT: You can get closer.

1245
00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:06.456
LAURA: (disapprovingly) Mm! Mm-mm!

1246
00:51:06.456 --> 00:51:07.839
MATT: It's up to you.
TRAVIS: (whispering) Get closer.

1247
00:51:07.839 --> 00:51:09.069
I'll go with you.

1248
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:11.710
TALIESIN: I'm doing, I'm doing--

1249
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:13.293
fucking instigator.

1250
00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:18.500
I'm going to burn one anyway just to take a look.

1251
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.756
And do I get anything?

1252
00:51:19.756 --> 00:51:21.058
MATT: Nothing immediately around you,

1253
00:51:21.058 --> 00:51:23.999
you're about, let's say 130 feet from them right now?

1254
00:51:23.999 --> 00:51:25.923
LIAM: I could always send in the vulture,

1255
00:51:25.923 --> 00:51:27.116
although the last time I did that,

1256
00:51:27.116 --> 00:51:29.481
it keyed those things into our position.

1257
00:51:29.481 --> 00:51:31.578
SAM: I'll go in. I got this.
LAURA: No, Nott, no.

1258
00:51:31.578 --> 00:51:34.756
MATT: Let's very-- let's just maybe get a little-- quietly,

1259
00:51:34.756 --> 00:51:37.490
get a little closer and see what's happening.

1260
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.719
LAURA: You don't sneak so well when you drink.

1261
00:51:38.719 --> 00:51:40.267
TALIESIN: I'm also keeping an eye out for

1262
00:51:40.267 --> 00:51:42.361
whatever could have done damage to this thing.

1263
00:51:42.361 --> 00:51:44.063
MATT: Right, with the same perception check,

1264
00:51:44.063 --> 00:51:45.279
still looking around.

1265
00:51:45.279 --> 00:51:47.603
TALIESIN: I'm definitely keeping eyes open.

1266
00:51:47.603 --> 00:51:49.719
Everybody keep their eyes open.

1267
00:51:49.719 --> 00:51:51.251
I'm going to try and get just close enough

1268
00:51:51.251 --> 00:51:53.455
to see if it's alive, dead, or otherwise,

1269
00:51:53.455 --> 00:51:55.255
within 60 feet of it, I suppose.

1270
00:51:55.255 --> 00:51:58.181
MATT: Okay, so on the moorbounders, slowly

1271
00:51:58.181 --> 00:52:00.698
you and Yasha are going to--

1272
00:52:00.698 --> 00:52:04.046
Your moorbounder goes (growling, sniffing)

1273
00:52:04.046 --> 00:52:07.208
TRAVIS: As he's doing that, we're scanning around,

1274
00:52:07.208 --> 00:52:08.351
just in case.

1275
00:52:08.351 --> 00:52:12.295
MATT: All right, I guess make a communal perception check

1276
00:52:12.295 --> 00:52:13.435
the rest of you.

1277
00:52:13.435 --> 00:52:15.268
MARISHA: Communal perception.

1278
00:52:17.951 --> 00:52:18.784
TRAVIS: 16.
MARISHA: 19.

1279
00:52:19.888 --> 00:52:20.721
LAURA: Ten.

1280
00:52:21.723 --> 00:52:22.873
SAM: Natural 20.

1281
00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:23.971
TALIESIN: Solid.

1282
00:52:23.971 --> 00:52:25.143
LIAM: 21.

1283
00:52:25.143 --> 00:52:28.607
MATT: Okay, you're keeping a pretty solid look around.

1284
00:52:28.607 --> 00:52:30.907
You guys get closer and closer.

1285
00:52:30.907 --> 00:52:33.123
You begin to see beyond the gaping wounds,

1286
00:52:33.123 --> 00:52:35.703
there are two large black spots

1287
00:52:35.703 --> 00:52:37.286
affixed to its body.

1288
00:52:38.643 --> 00:52:41.235
But the spots are shifting and moving.

1289
00:52:41.235 --> 00:52:43.863
You see black leathery wings,

1290
00:52:43.863 --> 00:52:47.338
that cling to the corpse-- sorry.

1291
00:52:48.451 --> 00:52:51.903
These large, dark, lizard-like bodies

1292
00:52:51.903 --> 00:52:55.335
feasting on the flesh of this dead creature.

1293
00:52:55.335 --> 00:52:58.395
Their forms leaking shadow like mist off the body,

1294
00:52:58.395 --> 00:53:00.978
just slowly drifting off of it.

1295
00:53:03.347 --> 00:53:05.207
Two of them glance over in your direction,

1296
00:53:05.207 --> 00:53:08.431
you see the yellow like bead glowing eyes

1297
00:53:08.431 --> 00:53:13.164
on each each of their weird dragon-esque face.

1298
00:53:15.931 --> 00:53:16.949
(growling)
TALIESIN: I'm not getting any closer,

1299
00:53:16.949 --> 00:53:19.532
but I'm not backing out either.

1300
00:53:20.863 --> 00:53:22.563
MATT: They both look at each other and then one goes like--

1301
00:53:22.563 --> 00:53:24.647
(snorting)

1302
00:53:24.647 --> 00:53:27.218
The other one (creaking and snapping)

1303
00:53:27.218 --> 00:53:28.468
TALIESIN: It occurs to me--

1304
00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:33.735
they can understand me. We'll keep moving.

1305
00:53:33.735 --> 00:53:34.799
SAM: They can understand you?

1306
00:53:34.799 --> 00:53:37.291
TALIESIN: I can talk to animals.

1307
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:39.391
Start to keep moving, see what happens.

1308
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:41.009
MATT: Okay.

1309
00:53:41.009 --> 00:53:42.524
You guys following suit with Caduceus?

1310
00:53:42.524 --> 00:53:43.857
SAM: Yeah!
LAURA: Uh-huh!

1311
00:53:43.857 --> 00:53:45.490
LIAM: Quietly following their lead, yeah.

1312
00:53:46.337 --> 00:53:49.996
MATT: You both continue to move past the north.

1313
00:53:49.996 --> 00:53:53.021
You get about 50,

1314
00:53:54.872 --> 00:53:56.230
100 feet further.

1315
00:53:58.064 --> 00:53:59.865
(wings flapping)

1316
00:53:59.865 --> 00:54:00.820
Looking back over your shoulder,

1317
00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.315
you can see both of them are now

1318
00:54:03.315 --> 00:54:05.564
taking up and as their wings flap,

1319
00:54:05.564 --> 00:54:10.168
you can see tendrils of shadow drifting off

1320
00:54:10.168 --> 00:54:11.601
and then fading a few feet from--

1321
00:54:11.601 --> 00:54:14.159
LAURA: I cast Bless!
MATT: -- each blast of its wings.

1322
00:54:14.159 --> 00:54:15.313
You're casting Bless on who?

1323
00:54:15.313 --> 00:54:19.140
LAURA: Fjord, Caduceus, and Yasha.
MATT: They're flying up.

1324
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.166
Fjord, Caduceus, Yasha, you guys have Bless, all right.

1325
00:54:21.166 --> 00:54:22.526
LIAM: Mage Armor on myself.

1326
00:54:22.526 --> 00:54:24.090
TALIESIN: Holding Daylight.

1327
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:25.904
MATT: Holding Daylight, okay.

1328
00:54:25.904 --> 00:54:27.946
LIAM: And Gift of Alacrity on Yasha.

1329
00:54:27.946 --> 00:54:29.834
MATT: All right, Gift of Alacrity on Yasha.

1330
00:54:29.834 --> 00:54:31.982
As you guys are riding on your moorbounders,

1331
00:54:31.982 --> 00:54:35.042
Caleb and Beauregard come up nearby

1332
00:54:35.042 --> 00:54:36.542
and Caleb reaches out and touches your shoulder,

1333
00:54:36.542 --> 00:54:38.234
and you're infused with the Gift of Alacrity

1334
00:54:38.234 --> 00:54:39.554
which means for the next eight hours,

1335
00:54:39.554 --> 00:54:42.857
you get to add a 1d8 to your initiative.

1336
00:54:42.857 --> 00:54:43.690
ASHLEY: Yes.

1337
00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:46.592
LAURA: 1d4 to saving throws and attack rolls.
SAM: Are we moving?

1338
00:54:46.592 --> 00:54:49.518
Is this a moving fight? Is this a car chase?

1339
00:54:49.518 --> 00:54:50.972
TALIESIN: I don't think we're moving yet--

1340
00:54:50.972 --> 00:54:51.928
LAURA: We're moving.

1341
00:54:51.928 --> 00:54:54.528
TALIESIN: We're moving, but we're not running yet.

1342
00:54:54.528 --> 00:54:56.148
I think until they start diving.

1343
00:54:56.148 --> 00:54:57.926
MATT: You guys are taking up the pace.

1344
00:54:57.926 --> 00:54:59.175
TALIESIN: We don't want them to know we know.

1345
00:54:59.175 --> 00:55:02.450
MATT: They both (soaring) and they begin to arc around

1346
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:05.258
both making a wide shift.

1347
00:55:06.962 --> 00:55:08.340
Now they're-- as opposed to behind you,

1348
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:10.714
they're now behind, they're starting to catch up on the left

1349
00:55:10.714 --> 00:55:13.558
they're definitely circling around you.

1350
00:55:13.558 --> 00:55:15.298
MARISHA: They're coming up our left?

1351
00:55:15.298 --> 00:55:16.350
MATT: They're coming up on, yeah.

1352
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:17.983
On the western side as you guys are traveling northward.

1353
00:55:17.983 --> 00:55:20.446
MARISHA: Is there anything coming up on our right?

1354
00:55:20.446 --> 00:55:21.832
MATT: You glance over in that direction,

1355
00:55:21.832 --> 00:55:22.974
based on the perception you made earlier,

1356
00:55:22.974 --> 00:55:24.457
you don't see anything else.

1357
00:55:24.457 --> 00:55:26.558
TRAVIS: What kind of radius are they keeping outside of us?

1358
00:55:26.558 --> 00:55:28.734
LAURA: Nott rolled a 20.

1359
00:55:28.734 --> 00:55:31.369
MATT: I know, don't worry, I know.

1360
00:55:31.369 --> 00:55:33.274
TRAVIS: What kind of distance are they keeping from us

1361
00:55:33.274 --> 00:55:35.194
in this circle they're making?

1362
00:55:35.194 --> 00:55:37.310
MATT: They're about 100 feet from you right now.

1363
00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:42.310
SAM: I'm going to rub a bit of fleece and cast Silent Image

1364
00:55:42.723 --> 00:55:46.790
and make the image of a fourth moorbounder

1365
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:49.582
next to us running with us,

1366
00:55:50.438 --> 00:55:54.902
and with some very nondescript person riding it.

1367
00:55:54.902 --> 00:55:55.735
MATT: Okay, so,

1368
00:55:56.854 --> 00:56:00.018
apparating out of the air, a fourth rider,

1369
00:56:00.018 --> 00:56:03.962
who's a nondescript person, very plain features,

1370
00:56:03.962 --> 00:56:05.528
beige clothing,

1371
00:56:07.312 --> 00:56:09.954
a haircut, riding.

1372
00:56:09.954 --> 00:56:11.298
TRAVIS: "A haircut."

1373
00:56:11.298 --> 00:56:12.697
(laughing)

1374
00:56:12.697 --> 00:56:14.623
Riding a moorbounder.

1375
00:56:14.623 --> 00:56:18.542
SAM: I'm thinking a polo shirt, khakis, some loafers.

1376
00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:21.994
TRAVIS: You think we should make this an annoying meal?

1377
00:56:21.994 --> 00:56:24.677
TALIESIN: I think if they move towards us

1378
00:56:24.677 --> 00:56:26.954
they've made that decision for us.

1379
00:56:26.954 --> 00:56:29.788
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like we should pick up speed.

1380
00:56:31.458 --> 00:56:34.382
TALIESIN: Everything here is weird.

1381
00:56:34.382 --> 00:56:36.454
MARISHA: We might be able to outrun them if we go now.

1382
00:56:36.454 --> 00:56:39.034
TRAVIS: I'm going to charge up an Eldritch Blast

1383
00:56:39.034 --> 00:56:41.073
and just follow them just in case

1384
00:56:41.073 --> 00:56:42.180
they start to break towards us.

1385
00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.514
MATT: To the right side, Nott, you can see a third one.

1386
00:56:45.514 --> 00:56:47.231
MARISHA: I knew it.

1387
00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:48.491
I knew it.

1388
00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:49.991
MATT: Seemingly hearing the screech

1389
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:52.691
from the one on the left that was heading the circle

1390
00:56:52.691 --> 00:56:54.459
and it looks like there are now three of them

1391
00:56:54.459 --> 00:56:58.284
slowly bearing down on you as you're moving northward.

1392
00:56:58.284 --> 00:57:00.207
MARISHA: Clever girl.

1393
00:57:00.207 --> 00:57:01.424
SAM: Let's pick up the pace.

1394
00:57:01.424 --> 00:57:02.257
MARISHA: Yeah.

1395
00:57:03.755 --> 00:57:07.047
I smack the back of Jannik's booty.

1396
00:57:08.855 --> 00:57:11.755
MATT: So now Jannik lunges forward at a much faster speed

1397
00:57:11.755 --> 00:57:13.224
going fast paced at this time.

1398
00:57:13.224 --> 00:57:14.379
Everyone else catching up as well?

1399
00:57:14.379 --> 00:57:16.103
LAURA: Yeah. Keep pace, Yarnball!

1400
00:57:16.103 --> 00:57:16.936
TALIESIN: Come on.

1401
00:57:18.447 --> 00:57:21.835
SAM: The very vague, generalized rider

1402
00:57:21.835 --> 00:57:25.839
is weirdly falling behind by about 40 feet.

1403
00:57:25.839 --> 00:57:27.684
He's not going to be able to catch up with us.

1404
00:57:27.684 --> 00:57:29.684
TRAVIS: More, more, he's terribly out of shape.

1405
00:57:31.091 --> 00:57:32.455
SAM: My range is only 60 feet.

1406
00:57:32.455 --> 00:57:34.557
So we got 58 feet.

1407
00:57:34.557 --> 00:57:36.713
MATT: What's your spell DC?

1408
00:57:36.713 --> 00:57:41.035
SAM: The spell DC-- oh boy I cast spells sometimes, don't I?

1409
00:57:41.035 --> 00:57:44.619
Is 15. Oh wow, that's pretty high.

1410
00:57:44.619 --> 00:57:45.702
MATT: That it is.

1411
00:57:47.167 --> 00:57:48.000
Okay.

1412
00:57:52.975 --> 00:57:57.975
All right, the one that's trailing the screeching leader

1413
00:57:57.998 --> 00:58:00.787
on the left hand side is--

1414
00:58:00.787 --> 00:58:03.259
and they're both keeping pace with your moorbounders.

1415
00:58:03.259 --> 00:58:05.647
They're not gaining at the moment,

1416
00:58:05.647 --> 00:58:07.714
but they're keeping pace to the left.

1417
00:58:07.714 --> 00:58:09.931
TRAVIS: Are we being fucking herded?

1418
00:58:09.931 --> 00:58:11.181
MATT: The one behind it,

1419
00:58:12.783 --> 00:58:14.867
the one behind it splinters off

1420
00:58:14.867 --> 00:58:17.297
and begins to make its way towards

1421
00:58:17.297 --> 00:58:19.427
the one that's not keeping up.

1422
00:58:19.427 --> 00:58:20.427
LAURA: Okay, good.

1423
00:58:21.539 --> 00:58:23.983
MATT: It lunges down--
SAM: Watch out, Chaz, watch out!

1424
00:58:23.983 --> 00:58:27.523
MATT: And you watch as it dives,

1425
00:58:27.523 --> 00:58:31.387
and then about 40 feet from the illusion,

1426
00:58:31.387 --> 00:58:34.687
vanishes, and Nightcrawler teleports

1427
00:58:34.687 --> 00:58:38.827
next to where this illusion is

1428
00:58:38.827 --> 00:58:41.167
and wings open, it looks like

1429
00:58:41.167 --> 00:58:44.135
a black leather skinned wyvern,

1430
00:58:44.135 --> 00:58:49.135
it arcs down with its claws and they pass through the body.

1431
00:58:49.419 --> 00:58:51.699
It's confused, arcs up again,

1432
00:58:51.699 --> 00:58:53.739
and is going to go for a second pass as well.

1433
00:58:53.739 --> 00:58:55.579
Now you have two that are pincering you

1434
00:58:55.579 --> 00:58:57.098
from the left and right and behind.

1435
00:58:57.098 --> 00:58:58.852
TALIESIN: Is it time for Daylight?

1436
00:58:58.852 --> 00:59:00.263
Just say the word.

1437
00:59:00.263 --> 00:59:01.096
SAM: Daylight?

1438
00:59:01.096 --> 00:59:02.002
MARISHA: How far does it reach?

1439
00:59:02.002 --> 00:59:03.142
LAURA: It's day time right now.

1440
00:59:03.142 --> 00:59:06.284
TALIESIN: Yeah, but this is a Daylight spell.

1441
00:59:06.284 --> 00:59:08.160
TRAVIS: Yeah, it couldn't hurt.

1442
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.948
TALIESIN: This gives us 60 feet.

1443
00:59:09.948 --> 00:59:12.652
Yeah, let's crank it up.

1444
00:59:12.652 --> 00:59:13.492
MATT: Okay, it is stationary?

1445
00:59:13.492 --> 00:59:14.941
TALIESIN: No it's not, it can be on an object.

1446
00:59:14.941 --> 00:59:15.892
MATT: Okay, what are you casting it on?

1447
00:59:15.892 --> 00:59:18.258
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast it on--

1448
00:59:18.258 --> 00:59:19.091
SAM: My dick.

1449
00:59:20.824 --> 00:59:22.482
TALIESIN: Sam's-- no.

1450
00:59:23.932 --> 00:59:26.956
I'm going to cast it on the moorbounder

1451
00:59:26.956 --> 00:59:28.304
that I'm currently riding.

1452
00:59:28.304 --> 00:59:29.644
MATT: Okay.

1453
00:59:29.644 --> 00:59:34.232
From the shaded, dark clouded sky above you

1454
00:59:34.232 --> 00:59:36.947
and the rain that's slowly making it your direction,

1455
00:59:36.947 --> 00:59:38.476
from the very front of the line

1456
00:59:38.476 --> 00:59:40.908
now this bright burning beacon of Daylight

1457
00:59:40.908 --> 00:59:43.784
emerges from the front part of the saddle

1458
00:59:43.784 --> 00:59:46.351
that Caduceus is holding onto

1459
00:59:46.351 --> 00:59:49.030
giving this large bright radius of sunlight.

1460
00:59:50.072 --> 00:59:53.136
You watch the two creatures that are flying

1461
00:59:53.136 --> 00:59:54.276
swoop in that direction

1462
00:59:54.276 --> 00:59:55.684
and as soon as the light flashes,

1463
00:59:55.684 --> 00:59:58.040
they both arc back a little bit

1464
00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.232
and maintain their separate pace to each side.

1465
01:00:00.232 --> 01:00:02.044
They're still keeping up with you guys,

1466
01:00:02.044 --> 01:00:04.639
but this seems to have shaken them a bit

1467
01:00:04.639 --> 01:00:07.144
to be interested in peeking any closer.

1468
01:00:07.144 --> 01:00:10.372
The one to the back is now on its third strike

1469
01:00:10.372 --> 01:00:14.856
on your companion before it seems to realize

1470
01:00:14.856 --> 01:00:16.356
and not give a shit, but it's definitely--

1471
01:00:16.356 --> 01:00:18.439
it's fallen behind and because of the pace

1472
01:00:18.439 --> 01:00:20.376
you guys are going and it's 60 feet behind you,

1473
01:00:20.376 --> 01:00:23.983
because moorbounders I believe, what's the speed on them?

1474
01:00:23.983 --> 01:00:26.843
LAURA: Oh, hold on, let me look.

1475
01:00:26.843 --> 01:00:29.171
MATT: I believe it's 80 feet, right?

1476
01:00:29.171 --> 01:00:31.043
LAURA: 40 feet.

1477
01:00:31.043 --> 01:00:32.243
MATT: 40 feet?

1478
01:00:32.243 --> 01:00:33.567
TALIESIN: Standard speed.

1479
01:00:33.567 --> 01:00:34.650
MATT: Right, okay.

1480
01:00:36.323 --> 01:00:39.893
LAURA: Yeah, but they can jump 30 feet.

1481
01:00:39.893 --> 01:00:41.567
MATT: Thought moorbounder was more than that.

1482
01:00:41.567 --> 01:00:43.274
LAURA: Well, that's what it says.

1483
01:00:43.274 --> 01:00:45.791
TALIESIN: They got little funny notes, though.

1484
01:00:45.791 --> 01:00:48.191
SAM: Oh yeah, look in the notes section right here.

1485
01:00:48.191 --> 01:00:49.024
What's that say?

1486
01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:50.761
MATT: Hold on, I have it here somewhere.

1487
01:00:50.761 --> 01:00:51.901
SAM: Just look right there.

1488
01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:52.969
MATT: There it is, moorbounder.

1489
01:00:52.969 --> 01:00:55.386
No, that is incorrect, they have a speed of 80 feet.

1490
01:00:55.386 --> 01:00:56.219
LAURA: Really?

1491
01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.052
MATT: Yeah, they're fast creatures.

1492
01:00:57.052 --> 01:00:59.288
LAURA: How do we fix that in here?

1493
01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:02.635
MATT: That's okay, but these creatures can fly 80 feet

1494
01:01:02.635 --> 01:01:06.099
so literally you guys are going in tandem,

1495
01:01:06.099 --> 01:01:08.141
but at the speed you're traveling, the one to the back

1496
01:01:08.141 --> 01:01:09.657
that went after the illusion

1497
01:01:09.657 --> 01:01:11.965
is not able to get closer to you at this pace.

1498
01:01:11.965 --> 01:01:14.169
SAM: I took out a whole one by myself.

1499
01:01:14.169 --> 01:01:15.219
MARISHA: Pretty good.

1500
01:01:15.219 --> 01:01:17.817
MATT: But you are essentially left, right, and behind now,

1501
01:01:17.817 --> 01:01:20.577
surrounded by these creatures as they're keeping the pace.

1502
01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:22.538
How long does the Daylight spell last?

1503
01:01:22.538 --> 01:01:24.820
TALIESIN: That's a good question. About an hour, I believe.

1504
01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.840
I'm double checking.

1505
01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840
MATT: All right.

1506
01:01:28.917 --> 01:01:29.909
TALIESIN: Yeah, one hour.

1507
01:01:29.909 --> 01:01:33.627
MATT: They are keeping about 100 foot distance from you

1508
01:01:33.627 --> 01:01:36.585
and the Daylight seems to be keeping them at bay.

1509
01:01:36.585 --> 01:01:37.949
SAM: Smart, Caddy.

1510
01:01:37.949 --> 01:01:39.885
MARISHA: Maybe they'll lose interest.

1511
01:01:39.885 --> 01:01:40.785
MATT: So you keep riding.

1512
01:01:40.785 --> 01:01:41.821
LAURA: Can we attack them at a distance

1513
01:01:41.821 --> 01:01:43.153
while they're away from us?

1514
01:01:43.153 --> 01:01:45.105
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can make it even more annoying.

1515
01:01:45.105 --> 01:01:46.987
TALIESIN: You got about a hundred, hundred and something.

1516
01:01:46.987 --> 01:01:47.980
TRAVIS: I do.

1517
01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.065
LIAM: Well--

1518
01:01:49.065 --> 01:01:50.298
SAM: You going to shoot?

1519
01:01:50.298 --> 01:01:53.649
LIAM: I would say 20 or 30 and see if they keep up

1520
01:01:53.649 --> 01:01:56.377
and if they are after us then we can harry them.

1521
01:01:56.377 --> 01:01:58.165
SAM: 20 or 30 seconds?

1522
01:01:58.165 --> 01:02:01.013
LIAM: Minutes. It's an hour he's got that going.

1523
01:02:01.013 --> 01:02:03.685
Maybe they will lose interest if it takes too long.

1524
01:02:03.685 --> 01:02:05.813
SAM: Can the moorbounders go at a full speed

1525
01:02:05.813 --> 01:02:08.005
for hours and hours, I guess?

1526
01:02:08.005 --> 01:02:10.005
TRAVIS: Horses can, so.
MATT: Yeah.

1527
01:02:11.509 --> 01:02:13.757
You take breaks every now and then for time,

1528
01:02:13.757 --> 01:02:18.526
but a total of eight hours of intense travel for a day

1529
01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:20.241
is considered possible.

1530
01:02:20.241 --> 01:02:22.341
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm of the opinion

1531
01:02:22.341 --> 01:02:24.141
that maybe just spooking them a little bit

1532
01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:26.797
might be a great idea.

1533
01:02:26.797 --> 01:02:27.924
SAM: Let's do it.

1534
01:02:27.924 --> 01:02:30.797
TRAVIS: (powering up and firing) Eldritch Blast.

1535
01:02:30.797 --> 01:02:32.477
MATT: All right, roll two attacks.

1536
01:02:32.477 --> 01:02:34.247
MATT: I don't like the way you said that.

1537
01:02:34.247 --> 01:02:35.517
MATT: This is against what?

1538
01:02:35.517 --> 01:02:36.811
The one left, behind, or the right?

1539
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:38.683
LAURA: You get a plus four to your attack roll.

1540
01:02:38.683 --> 01:02:40.824
TRAVIS: I'll be like (yelling, firing).

1541
01:02:42.672 --> 01:02:45.284
MATT: You just Gun Kata them.

1542
01:02:45.284 --> 01:02:46.749
LIAM: Where did those doves come from?

1543
01:02:46.749 --> 01:02:48.519
LAURA: Plus a d4 to each attack roll

1544
01:02:48.519 --> 01:02:49.692
because you're blessed.

1545
01:02:49.692 --> 01:02:53.712
TRAVIS: Thank you. Natural one, and the other one is a 23.

1546
01:02:53.712 --> 01:02:55.076
MATT: 23 to the one on the right.

1547
01:02:55.076 --> 01:02:56.756
That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1548
01:02:56.756 --> 01:02:57.688
TRAVIS: d4 damage or--?

1549
01:02:57.688 --> 01:02:59.855
LAURA: No, to your attack roll!

1550
01:03:00.835 --> 01:03:02.049
SAM: Doesn't matter. It hit.
TRAVIS: Yeah, it hit.

1551
01:03:02.049 --> 01:03:03.753
LAURA: Okay, whatever.

1552
01:03:03.753 --> 01:03:07.403
TRAVIS: That's a 12. That's not the right dice.

1553
01:03:07.403 --> 01:03:09.261
Six--
SAM: (mumbled) Eldritch Blast!

1554
01:03:09.261 --> 01:03:10.913
TRAVIS: 11 points of Eldritch Blast damage.

1555
01:03:10.913 --> 01:03:12.293
MATT: 11 points of Eldritch Blast damage.

1556
01:03:12.293 --> 01:03:16.635
So one goes wide and you watch that one

1557
01:03:17.765 --> 01:03:20.340
shadow-like flying wyvern

1558
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.172
dodge out of the way and goes wide

1559
01:03:22.172 --> 01:03:24.272
and vanishes into the clouds above.

1560
01:03:24.272 --> 01:03:26.860
The one to your right,

1561
01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.900
shrieks as it spins towards you

1562
01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.261
and you can see now it's starting to

1563
01:03:30.261 --> 01:03:32.559
lean its way closer to try and

1564
01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:33.392
meet the direction.

1565
01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:34.225
LAURA: Right when he turns to look,

1566
01:03:34.225 --> 01:03:35.376
I shoot a Guiding Bolt at him.

1567
01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:36.368
MATT: What's the range on Guiding Bolt?

1568
01:03:36.368 --> 01:03:37.386
LAURA: 120 feet.

1569
01:03:37.386 --> 01:03:42.024
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage-- or roll for attack, sorry.

1570
01:03:42.024 --> 01:03:44.866
LAURA: 17 plus nine.

1571
01:03:44.866 --> 01:03:48.023
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1572
01:03:51.836 --> 01:03:53.427
LAURA: What am I doing? 4d6.

1573
01:03:57.649 --> 01:04:01.156
11. 17, thank you.

1574
01:04:01.156 --> 01:04:01.989
MATT: 17.

1575
01:04:05.518 --> 01:04:07.352
LAURA: Radiant damage.

1576
01:04:07.352 --> 01:04:10.752
MATT: Radiant damage, so as you release, it

1577
01:04:10.752 --> 01:04:12.760
arcs up and-- this is the same one

1578
01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.260
that Fjord had hit before?

1579
01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.536
LAURA: Yes.

1580
01:04:15.536 --> 01:04:17.952
MATT: As the Guiding Bolt blasts into its chest,

1581
01:04:17.952 --> 01:04:21.988
you watch the bright sacred energy of this spell

1582
01:04:21.988 --> 01:04:24.656
burn and sear into its body with an intensity

1583
01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:26.052
that you've not struck a creature

1584
01:04:26.052 --> 01:04:27.700
with a Guiding Bolt before.

1585
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:30.480
It shrieks out horribly in pain

1586
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.099
and you watch as the shadow almost seems

1587
01:04:32.099 --> 01:04:33.682
to bleed out of it.

1588
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.168
That, that hurt it very badly.

1589
01:04:37.168 --> 01:04:38.001
SAM: Wow.

1590
01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:39.492
MARISHA: What did you do to it?

1591
01:04:39.492 --> 01:04:40.964
LAURA: Do it again.

1592
01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:42.012
MARISHA: That was awesome.

1593
01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:45.642
MATT: And it arcs off to go to about 150 feet away and keep

1594
01:04:45.642 --> 01:04:49.016
tandem, but it is hurt. It's like, (labored flapping)

1595
01:04:49.016 --> 01:04:50.546
150 feet away.

1596
01:04:50.546 --> 01:04:53.260
The one that's on the left side though, however,

1597
01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.324
while you're focusing on this is now leaning in.

1598
01:04:56.324 --> 01:04:58.075
LIAM: Now I throw a Fire Bolt at it.

1599
01:04:58.075 --> 01:04:58.908
MATT: A Fire Bolt at it?

1600
01:04:58.908 --> 01:04:59.741
Go for it.

1601
01:04:59.741 --> 01:05:03.403
So the one on the left is now arcing forward.

1602
01:05:03.403 --> 01:05:04.547
LIAM: Oh a natural one.

1603
01:05:04.547 --> 01:05:06.130
MATT: Ah, it goes wide.

1604
01:05:07.367 --> 01:05:10.135
It scoots up.
LAURA: Sacred Flame.

1605
01:05:10.135 --> 01:05:11.939
MATT: Sacred Flame. What's the roll on that one?

1606
01:05:11.939 --> 01:05:14.731
LAURA: Dexterity, 17.
MATT: Dexterity?

1607
01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:17.156
Natural 17 plus...

1608
01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:20.214
yeah, that's a 25, sorry.

1609
01:05:20.214 --> 01:05:21.619
SAM: Yasha, Beau, why aren't you fighting?

1610
01:05:21.619 --> 01:05:23.772
TALIESIN: Is it close enough to-- I'll take a

1611
01:05:23.772 --> 01:05:25.787
Sacred Flame shot at that thing.

1612
01:05:25.787 --> 01:05:28.367
MATT: Go for it, all right.

1613
01:05:28.367 --> 01:05:30.533
Sacred Flame. That is going to be a 22.

1614
01:05:30.533 --> 01:05:32.196
TALIESIN: Oh man.

1615
01:05:32.196 --> 01:05:34.505
MATT: They're quick, and it's like (whoosh).

1616
01:05:34.505 --> 01:05:37.309
They're just spiraling now through the sky.

1617
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:38.929
TRAVIS: I'll strike a new Boondocks pose.

1618
01:05:38.929 --> 01:05:42.541
Criss cross, two more Eldritch Blast shots at it.

1619
01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:44.356
MATT: To the ones coming nearby? Go for it.

1620
01:05:44.356 --> 01:05:45.856
Roll both attacks.

1621
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:48.841
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

1622
01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:50.654
MATT: Oh shit! Nice.

1623
01:05:50.654 --> 01:05:51.962
TRAVIS: And a 13.

1624
01:05:51.962 --> 01:05:54.413
MATT: 13 misses.
LAURA: Add a four, add a four!

1625
01:05:54.413 --> 01:05:56.753
MATT: All right, roll a d4, see if you can move that 13 up,

1626
01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:58.913
because it's missing currently.

1627
01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:00.053
TRAVIS: I can't grab it.

1628
01:06:00.053 --> 01:06:02.466
MARISHA: His fingers are too fat to grab it.

1629
01:06:02.466 --> 01:06:04.193
TRAVIS: 15.
MATT: Miss.

1630
01:06:04.193 --> 01:06:05.743
14, you mean, right?

1631
01:06:05.743 --> 01:06:08.012
13 plus one?
TRAVIS: Yes, 14 sorry.

1632
01:06:08.012 --> 01:06:09.976
MATT: So that misses.

1633
01:06:09.976 --> 01:06:12.528
TRAVIS: Oh that is a balls roll.

1634
01:06:12.528 --> 01:06:14.552
Nine points of Eldritch Blast damage.

1635
01:06:14.552 --> 01:06:18.220
MATT: Nine points of Eldritch Blast damage.

1636
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.728
That's okay. It is now pushed and you can see

1637
01:06:20.728 --> 01:06:22.480
that the Daylight-- it comes within

1638
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.620
the 60 foot radius of the Daylight,

1639
01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.292
pushes into it and it's--

1640
01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:29.620
as the Daylight hits it, you the skin gray a bit,

1641
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.048
the shadow that's pouring off of it

1642
01:06:31.048 --> 01:06:32.996
begins to wither and dissipate.

1643
01:06:32.996 --> 01:06:36.473
It's still physical, but it seems to not be enjoying

1644
01:06:36.473 --> 01:06:38.204
being that close to the light,

1645
01:06:38.204 --> 01:06:40.828
but it's forcing itself into that area.

1646
01:06:40.828 --> 01:06:44.368
It begins to move within 40 feet of your cluster,

1647
01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:49.176
riding forward before it (screams)

1648
01:06:49.176 --> 01:06:51.789
let's out this piercing screech.

1649
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:56.124

All right so, Beau and Jester,

1662
01:07:22.614 --> 01:07:27.100
the screech hits your ears, you clasp the side of your head,

1663
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:31.751
and you find your body just locked up in absolute fear.

1664
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:34.495
You're both paralyzed for the next round.

01:07:48.007 --> 01:07:49.447

1673
01:07:49.447 --> 01:07:51.545
and add to the extra damage.

1674
01:07:51.545 --> 01:07:52.627

what happens?

1679

Sending all of you flying from their back,

1686
01:08:22.545 --> 01:08:26.341
flung and tossed. At full moorbounder speed,

1687
01:08:26.341 --> 01:08:29.914

seven point of bludgeoning damage

1705
01:09:05.438 --> 01:09:07.329

Everyone else, that succeeds takes three,

1709
01:09:12.894 --> 01:09:14.470

1744
01:10:49.029 --> 01:10:50.504
SAM: That's about right.

1745
01:10:51.495 --> 01:10:53.428
That's about how good a singer she was.

1746
01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:57.670
No, not Marisha.

1747
01:11:00.072 --> 01:11:01.797
MARISHA: Both are accurate. It's fine.

1748
01:11:01.797 --> 01:11:02.823
ASHLEY: You kind of lost the commitment at pack.

1749
01:11:02.823 --> 01:11:04.943
(trailing off) Leader of the pack.

1750
01:11:04.943 --> 01:11:07.001
(laughter)

1751
01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:09.469
LAURA: Oh no the third one's going to come get us, too,

1752
01:11:09.469 --> 01:11:11.017
because we're stuck.

1753
01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:12.769
TRAVIS: Those fucking things.

1754
01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.706
MATT: Yeah, you guys fought them last campaign.

1755
01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:17.447
LIAM: They're from Thar Amphala. Right?

1756
01:11:18.364 --> 01:11:19.747
LAURA: (gasps)

1757
01:11:19.747 --> 01:11:21.397
SAM: Oh boy.

1758
01:11:21.397 --> 01:11:22.230
MATT: Gloomstalkers.

1759
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:25.343
SAM: Don't worry! We fought these last campaign.

1760
01:11:25.343 --> 01:11:27.489
MARISHA: Gloomstalkers.
LAURA: They're bad.

1761
01:11:27.489 --> 01:11:29.125
And we fought them at a much higher level

1762
01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:30.353
at the last campaign.

1763
01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:33.186
SAM: Yeah, wasn't-- weren't we like 18?

1764
01:11:34.297 --> 01:11:38.214
LAURA: Oh that's right, that's right! You killed one.

1765
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:42.043
SAM: With Arkhan?

1766
01:11:43.294 --> 01:11:44.127
LAURA: No, stop stop!

1767
01:11:45.224 --> 01:11:48.132
SAM: That's when Vecna killed us all, right?

1768
01:11:48.132 --> 01:11:51.252
MATT: So, let's go ahead and roll initiative.

1769
01:11:51.252 --> 01:11:53.737
MARISHA: Are Jester and I still paralyzed?

1770
01:11:53.737 --> 01:11:56.335
MATT: For this first round, you're paralyzed.

1771
01:11:56.335 --> 01:11:58.812
LAURA: Okay, do we still roll initiative?

1772
01:11:58.812 --> 01:12:01.464
MATT: You do. You're still in initiative order.

1773
01:12:01.464 --> 01:12:02.636
LIAM: Did you roll your d8?

1774
01:12:02.636 --> 01:12:03.984
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural 20.

1775
01:12:03.984 --> 01:12:04.817
LIAM: You still add it.

1776
01:12:04.817 --> 01:12:06.587
ASHLEY: I do?
MATT: Yeah.

1777
01:12:08.035 --> 01:12:10.629
TRAVIS: Does Bless count to our initiative?

1778
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:12.312
MATT: So 25 to 20.

1779
01:12:12.312 --> 01:12:14.020
LAURA: 20.
SAM: 21.

1780
01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.187
MATT: All righty so.

1781
01:12:16.463 --> 01:12:18.129
TRAVIS: Nott, Jester.

1782
01:12:20.009 --> 01:12:21.225
SAM: Well, Yasha's probably--

1783
01:12:21.225 --> 01:12:22.436
MATT: Yasha, what'd you get for initiative?

1784
01:12:22.436 --> 01:12:23.272
ASHLEY: 26.

1785
01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.813
MATT: Jeez!

1786
01:12:24.813 --> 01:12:26.396
ASHLEY: That's the highest initiative I've ever rolled.

1787
01:12:26.396 --> 01:12:28.372
TALIESIN: That's the highest initiative I think possible.

1788
01:12:28.372 --> 01:12:30.100
MATT: 20 to 15?

1789
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.070
LIAM: 15.
MARISHA: 15.

1790
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:33.331
SAM: <i>Fünf</i>-teen.

1791
01:12:33.331 --> 01:12:34.704
LIAM: <i>Fünfzehn.</i>

1792
01:12:34.704 --> 01:12:35.979
LAURA: What did you guys get?

1793
01:12:35.979 --> 01:12:40.359
MARISHA: Both 15, Empire kids.

1794
01:12:40.359 --> 01:12:42.201
TALIESIN: We still have Daylight.

1795
01:12:42.201 --> 01:12:43.940
MATT: Ten to five. Is Daylight concentration or not?

1796
01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:44.773
TALIESIN: Nope.

1797
01:12:44.773 --> 01:12:46.683
MATT: Yeah, lasts for an hour, that's awesome.

1798
01:12:46.683 --> 01:12:48.616
TRAVIS: 13 for me.
TALIESIN: 12.

1799
01:12:48.616 --> 01:12:50.307
MATT: All right, Fjord,

1800
01:12:51.335 --> 01:12:53.849
and Caduceus, you got it.

1801
01:12:53.849 --> 01:12:57.924
All right so, top of the round.

1802
01:12:59.128 --> 01:13:03.181
Yasha, you are on the ground prone,

1803
01:13:03.181 --> 01:13:06.028
you manage to prevent yourself taking too much damage,

1804
01:13:06.028 --> 01:13:08.969
but you are over on the far end there.

1805
01:13:08.969 --> 01:13:11.085
They are all three up in the air,

1806
01:13:11.085 --> 01:13:12.569
what are you doing?

1807
01:13:12.569 --> 01:13:13.402
ASHLEY: Okay.

1808
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:15.424
I am going to--

1809
01:13:18.465 --> 01:13:22.530
Okay. I'm going to stand up. Where am I at?

1810
01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:23.391
MATT: There.

1811
01:13:23.391 --> 01:13:25.357
ASHLEY: Oh shit, okay.

1812
01:13:26.719 --> 01:13:29.811
I guess that one's closest so I'm just going to

1813
01:13:29.811 --> 01:13:31.454
stand up and start making my way over to that one.

1814
01:13:31.454 --> 01:13:33.137
MATT: 20 feet to get up.

1815
01:13:33.137 --> 01:13:34.978
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Damn.

1816
01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:38.642
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, and that's your movement.

1817
01:13:38.642 --> 01:13:40.170
You still have your action, which you can dash

1818
01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:42.130
as well, if you want to.

1819
01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:44.234
ASHLEY: I'll dash the rest of the way.

1820
01:13:44.234 --> 01:13:47.146
MATT: All right so you move under there.

1821
01:13:51.854 --> 01:13:53.862
ASHLEY: I have the Skingorger out

1822
01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:56.682
so I'm going to stand there and just look at them.

1823
01:13:56.682 --> 01:14:00.265
MATT: Bonus action, nothing, you're holding on?

1824
01:14:02.506 --> 01:14:04.506
ASHLEY: I would like to rage.

1825
01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:06.206
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1826
01:14:06.206 --> 01:14:08.593
MATT: All right, you are raging.
ASHLEY: As my bonus action!

1827
01:14:08.593 --> 01:14:11.578
MATT: So with the Magician's Judge sheathed

1828
01:14:11.578 --> 01:14:14.610
and over your shoulder, you have the Skingorger out,

1829
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:18.106
giant rusted angry blade, and you stand beneath it

1830
01:14:18.106 --> 01:14:22.681
and just growl at the gloomstalker floating above you.

1831
01:14:22.681 --> 01:14:23.761
ASHLEY: Come on down here, buddy.

1832
01:14:23.761 --> 01:14:25.377
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn.

1833
01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:27.437
Next up is Nott, followed up by Jester on deck.

1834
01:14:27.437 --> 01:14:28.473
Nott, what are you doing?

1835
01:14:28.473 --> 01:14:29.789
SAM: Oh boy. Standing up.

1836
01:14:29.789 --> 01:14:32.193
MATT: All right, that's half your movement there,

1837
01:14:32.193 --> 01:14:33.943
so we'll say you have 20 more feet.

1838
01:14:35.085 --> 01:14:38.053
SAM: I'll run to the tree, towards the tree if I can get.

1839
01:14:38.053 --> 01:14:41.429
MATT: Five jump, you leap over a paralyzed Beau.

1840
01:14:41.429 --> 01:14:42.585
SAM: Oh boy.

1841
01:14:42.585 --> 01:14:43.665
MATT: You get behind the tree there.

1842
01:14:43.665 --> 01:14:44.498
SAM: Okay.

1843
01:14:53.273 --> 01:14:56.940
Boy oh boy, okay I will,

1844
01:14:57.809 --> 01:14:58.902
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1845
01:14:58.902 --> 01:15:01.917
I'm going to cast Phantasmal Force

1846
01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:04.185
on the one that's closest to us.

1847
01:15:04.185 --> 01:15:05.533
MATT: All righty.

1848
01:15:05.533 --> 01:15:07.116
TRAVIS: Dope, dope, dope.

1849
01:15:08.177 --> 01:15:11.937
SAM: (uncertain noises)

1850
01:15:11.937 --> 01:15:13.005
MATT: Intelligence saving throw?

1851
01:15:13.005 --> 01:15:14.005
SAM: Yes, of 15.

1852
01:15:15.373 --> 01:15:18.730
MATT: Rolled a natural 17 minus three.

1853
01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:20.069
14, so that's a success.

1854
01:15:20.069 --> 01:15:23.593
SAM: Oh wow, not intelligent creatures.

1855
01:15:23.593 --> 01:15:25.153
MATT: These creatures, they're

1856
01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:29.773
very much monstrosities without a classic intelligence.

1857
01:15:29.773 --> 01:15:32.247
SAM: What do I make it think?

1858
01:15:32.247 --> 01:15:33.914
This is the problem.

1859
01:15:35.113 --> 01:15:37.437
LAURA: Make it see daylight.

1860
01:15:37.437 --> 01:15:41.369
SAM: Yeah, I was going to make like a fire, but I guess

1861
01:15:41.369 --> 01:15:44.625
I will make it, let's see here.

1862
01:15:44.625 --> 01:15:45.956
TALIESIN: We are in daylight right now.

1863
01:15:45.956 --> 01:15:49.125
SAM: I know, but like intense daylight.

1864
01:15:49.125 --> 01:15:53.521
I can only make it see a ten-foot cube of something.

1865
01:15:53.521 --> 01:15:55.108
Shit.

1866
01:15:55.108 --> 01:15:55.941
MATT: What are you doing?

1867
01:15:55.941 --> 01:15:57.896
SAM: Shit, I don't know what would help it.

1868
01:15:57.896 --> 01:15:59.262
I'm going to, I'm going to--

1869
01:15:59.262 --> 01:16:01.010
(high-pitched) Eee!

1870
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:03.722
(laughter)

1871
01:16:03.722 --> 01:16:05.511
MATT: Whoa!

1872
01:16:05.511 --> 01:16:07.627
TRAVIS: Pig sooie!

1873
01:16:07.627 --> 01:16:10.052
(laughter)

1874
01:16:10.052 --> 01:16:14.965
SAM: I'm going to make it that there is a giant fly swatter

1875
01:16:16.676 --> 01:16:19.423
that's trying to hit it.

1876
01:16:19.423 --> 01:16:21.256
A magical fly swatter.

1877
01:16:22.768 --> 01:16:26.336
That's right in front of it and the fly swatter swings

1878
01:16:26.336 --> 01:16:27.946
and hits it.

1879
01:16:27.946 --> 01:16:29.216
MATT: Okay!

1880
01:16:29.216 --> 01:16:32.456
SAM: And it receives four points of damage.

1881
01:16:32.456 --> 01:16:35.367
MATT: Four points of radiant damage, all righty.

1882
01:16:35.367 --> 01:16:36.617
Not radiant because this is--

1883
01:16:36.617 --> 01:16:40.544
SAM: It's interposing between it and us.

1884
01:16:40.544 --> 01:16:42.808
It's like waiting to--

1885
01:16:42.808 --> 01:16:44.908
if it comes any closer it'll get whacked

1886
01:16:44.908 --> 01:16:46.511
with a ten-foot high fly swatter.

1887
01:16:46.511 --> 01:16:48.808
MATT: All right, you got it.

1888
01:16:48.808 --> 01:16:52.891
LAURA: Can I ask what creature I hit before with the--

1889
01:16:53.864 --> 01:16:55.705
TRAVIS: Yeah, which one was the one that was getting beat?

1890
01:16:55.705 --> 01:16:58.092
MATT: This is the one that got wrecked by--

1891
01:16:58.092 --> 01:16:59.068
LAURA: So we would still have advantage

1892
01:16:59.068 --> 01:17:00.448
on the next hit against it?

1893
01:17:00.448 --> 01:17:01.281
MATT: Correct.

1894
01:17:01.281 --> 01:17:02.324
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Oh nice.

1895
01:17:02.324 --> 01:17:05.576
MATT: Actually, I'll go ahead and mark it like this

1896
01:17:05.576 --> 01:17:06.491
as a reminder.

1897
01:17:06.491 --> 01:17:07.324
SAM: That's Hex?

1898
01:17:07.324 --> 01:17:10.075
LAURA: No, that's just advantage from the Guiding Bolt.

1899
01:17:10.075 --> 01:17:11.309
MATT: It it until the next turn?

1900
01:17:11.309 --> 01:17:15.809
Or is it-- how long does the Guiding Bolt benefit last?

1901
01:17:16.991 --> 01:17:18.459
LAURA: The next attack roll made against this target

1902
01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:20.208
before the end of my next turn.

1903
01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:22.827
MATT: Okay, yeah so it's faded by now.

1904
01:17:22.827 --> 01:17:25.151
But this guy's looking rough,

1905
01:17:25.151 --> 01:17:28.375
like that bolt wrecked his world.

1906
01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:30.456
All right so, Nott, is it the end of your turn?

1907
01:17:30.456 --> 01:17:32.858
SAM: Oh, and then bonus action to hide.

1908
01:17:32.858 --> 01:17:35.919
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a stealth check, please.

1909
01:17:35.919 --> 01:17:37.511
SAM: Do I get advantage because I'm wearing my cloak?

1910
01:17:37.511 --> 01:17:39.147
MATT: You do.

1911
01:17:39.147 --> 01:17:40.647
SAM: Better, okay, 19.

1912
01:17:40.647 --> 01:17:43.688
MATT: 19, got it, you believe you may have--

1913
01:17:43.688 --> 01:17:44.521
SAM: 21, actually.

1914
01:17:44.521 --> 01:17:46.167
MATT: Okay, 21. Jester, what are you doing?

1915
01:17:46.167 --> 01:17:47.000
LAURA: I'm paralyzed.

1916
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.255
MATT: That's right, you're paralyzed so,

1917
01:17:48.255 --> 01:17:49.672
that's your turn.

1918
01:17:51.803 --> 01:17:52.636
Sorry.

1919
01:17:53.634 --> 01:17:55.331
LAURA: I feel like you've got to work on your delivery

1920
01:17:55.331 --> 01:17:57.171
of bad news, Matt.
MATT: I know, I don't mean to.

1921
01:17:57.171 --> 01:17:58.246
But you are no longer paralyzed

1922
01:17:58.246 --> 01:17:59.079
now that it's the end of your turn.

1923
01:17:59.079 --> 01:17:59.912
LAURA: Yay! That's better.

1924
01:17:59.912 --> 01:18:04.131
MATT: You get the use of yourself back.

1925
01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:05.675
It's now their turn.

1926
01:18:05.675 --> 01:18:08.179
LAURA: Can I at least roll over at the end of my turn

1927
01:18:08.179 --> 01:18:10.398
so I'm facing up and seeing them kill me?

1928
01:18:10.398 --> 01:18:12.211
MATT: Nope, you're still facing down.

1929
01:18:12.211 --> 01:18:13.044
LAURA: Balls.

1930
01:18:15.677 --> 01:18:19.216
MATT: This one here, it's seeing the swatter.

1931
01:18:19.216 --> 01:18:20.539
It was originally going to go

1932
01:18:20.539 --> 01:18:22.519
for the paralyzed target, which was Beau.

1933
01:18:22.519 --> 01:18:24.547
Instead, it's going to go for Yasha.

1934
01:18:24.547 --> 01:18:28.047
So it's going to try and swoop underneath it.

1935
01:18:29.855 --> 01:18:31.131
Let's see here.

1936
01:18:31.131 --> 01:18:31.964
SAM: Get it, Yasha!

1937
01:18:33.087 --> 01:18:35.554
TRAVIS, LAURA, and ASHLEY: Ach!

1938
01:18:35.554 --> 01:18:38.075
MATT: Swoops down. It's going to attempt

1939
01:18:38.075 --> 01:18:41.075
to make a snatch attack against you.

1940
01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:45.367
That is a 15 to hit.

1941
01:18:45.367 --> 01:18:46.325
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1942
01:18:46.325 --> 01:18:49.492
MATT: That hits you. All right, you suffer

1943
01:18:50.824 --> 01:18:53.583
12 points of slashing damage, reduced to six,

1944
01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:55.879
and I need you to make a strength saving throw.

1945
01:18:55.879 --> 01:18:58.157
You have advantage because you're raging.

1946
01:18:58.157 --> 01:18:59.555
TALIESIN: And a d4 still.

1947
01:18:59.555 --> 01:19:01.758
She's going to be fine, guys.

1948
01:19:01.758 --> 01:19:03.068
Travis, stop worrying.

1949
01:19:03.068 --> 01:19:03.901
ASHLEY: Ugh!

1950
01:19:06.155 --> 01:19:07.671
Oh no.

1951
01:19:07.671 --> 01:19:10.009
TALIESIN: Take that d4, too.

1952
01:19:10.009 --> 01:19:11.370
LAURA: Do I need to make a concentration check?

1953
01:19:11.370 --> 01:19:15.070
Because I took bludgeoning

1954
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:17.586
where I landed on the ground?

1955
01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:18.538
MATT: What were you concentrating on?

1956
01:19:18.538 --> 01:19:19.457
LAURA: Bless.

1957
01:19:19.457 --> 01:19:21.224
MATT: Bless, yes, you would.

1958
01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:22.774
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: 16?

1959
01:19:23.654 --> 01:19:25.002
Ooh, you're lucky you did that, yeah.

1960
01:19:25.002 --> 01:19:26.132
You are not grappled.

1961
01:19:26.132 --> 01:19:27.588
SAM: See, Travis? Come on.

1962
01:19:27.588 --> 01:19:28.421
TALIESIN: That d4, man.

1963
01:19:28.421 --> 01:19:30.626
ASHLEY: That d4, fuck. That Bless.

1964
01:19:30.626 --> 01:19:31.661
LAURA: And it succeeded.

1965
01:19:31.661 --> 01:19:32.982
MATT: Okay, cool, you're fine.

1966
01:19:32.982 --> 01:19:34.938
So it attempts to rake its claws.

1967
01:19:34.938 --> 01:19:36.426
It has this a pair of wings

1968
01:19:36.426 --> 01:19:38.229
and these large talon claws underneath

1969
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:39.850
and they both try and grab and slice at you

1970
01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:41.634
and lift you off the ground.

1971
01:19:41.634 --> 01:19:44.650
You get a couple inches off before you just shrug it off

1972
01:19:44.650 --> 01:19:46.302
and land back on the ground.

1973
01:19:46.302 --> 01:19:48.582
With that, it's going to attempt to

1974
01:19:48.582 --> 01:19:50.934
swoop back up even higher out of range.

1975
01:19:50.934 --> 01:19:53.602
You do get an attack of opportunity

1976
01:19:53.602 --> 01:19:55.290
as it's moving out of the space.

1977
01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.848
MARISHA: Sentinel!

1978
01:20:01.014 --> 01:20:03.070
ASHLEY: That's not very good.
SAM: Plus your d4.

1979
01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:04.662
ASHLEY: That's right, okay, okay, okay, hold on.

1980
01:20:04.662 --> 01:20:05.878
TALIESIN: Yeah, all attacks.

1981
01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:10.873
ASHLEY: So that was eight, three, plus

1982
01:20:12.682 --> 01:20:15.154
I'm so sorry.
MATT: Did not get its shriek back

1983
01:20:15.154 --> 01:20:16.074
TRAVIS: Did not get its shriek back?

1984
01:20:16.074 --> 01:20:16.907
MATT: Correct.

1985
01:20:19.909 --> 01:20:20.822
ASHLEY: 15?

1986
01:20:20.822 --> 01:20:22.072
MATT: 15 just hits.

1987
01:20:22.922 --> 01:20:26.439
So it does not make it back up

1988
01:20:27.305 --> 01:20:29.368
it is still locked there.

1989
01:20:29.368 --> 01:20:30.201
LAURA: Yes!

1990
01:20:32.058 --> 01:20:35.058
MATT: Go ahead and roll your attack.

1991
01:20:36.579 --> 01:20:37.662
LAURA: You need to organize your dice.

1992
01:20:37.662 --> 01:20:39.073
ASHLEY: I know I do, I know.

1993
01:20:39.073 --> 01:20:42.254
MATT: You do notice that while they're in the sunlight,

1994
01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.246
they're having a harder time attacking.

1995
01:20:44.246 --> 01:20:45.554
Like even the one that attacked you,

1996
01:20:45.554 --> 01:20:48.462
it was like having to veer its head

1997
01:20:48.462 --> 01:20:50.246
from the sunlight.

1998
01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:51.282
ASHLEY: This is just a regular attack, right?

1999
01:20:51.282 --> 01:20:52.115
MATT: Correct.

2000
01:20:53.454 --> 01:20:56.362
ASHLEY: Okay, so, seven.

2001
01:20:57.718 --> 01:21:00.138
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

2002
01:21:00.138 --> 01:21:00.982
SAM: Are they undead?

2003
01:21:00.982 --> 01:21:01.817
MATT: You don't know.

2004
01:21:01.817 --> 01:21:03.033
LAURA: Gloomstalkers?

2005
01:21:03.917 --> 01:21:05.022
LIAM: We don't know.

2006
01:21:05.022 --> 01:21:08.604
ASHLEY: 11 points of damage.
MATT: 11 points of damage to it.

2007
01:21:08.604 --> 01:21:13.604
All right. This one here is going to swoop

2008
01:21:13.612 --> 01:21:14.445
overhead.

2009
01:21:17.818 --> 01:21:20.572
40, so it stays about 20 feet up.

2010
01:21:20.572 --> 01:21:21.405
LAURA: You asshole!

2011
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:25.975
MATT: We'll say there.

2012
01:21:32.542 --> 01:21:33.450
LAURA: Ew!

2013
01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:35.470
MATT: And it's going to shriek again.

2014
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:37.603
(shrieking)

2015
01:21:37.603 --> 01:21:39.090
Screening the area, I need everyone to make

2016
01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:40.258
another constitution saving throw.

2017
01:21:40.258 --> 01:21:41.832
MARISHA: If you're already paralyzed,

2018
01:21:41.832 --> 01:21:43.467
can it re-paralyze you?

2019
01:21:43.467 --> 01:21:45.778
And it double paralyzes, yeah?

2020
01:21:45.778 --> 01:21:47.550
LIAM: If you beat it, it doesn't matter,

2021
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:49.708
just every time.

2022
01:21:49.708 --> 01:21:51.390
TRAVIS: 23.
LAURA: Oh, a natural 20.

2023
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:53.877
SAM: But you're already paralyzed.

2024
01:21:53.877 --> 01:21:55.318
MATT: No, she's no longer paralyzed.

2025
01:21:55.318 --> 01:21:56.151
SAM: Oh, hey.

2026
01:21:57.466 --> 01:21:59.098
20 for me.

2027
01:21:59.098 --> 01:22:00.296
MATT: All righty.

2028
01:22:00.296 --> 01:22:02.616
LIAM: I'm going to roll again using my Fortune's Favor.

2029
01:22:02.616 --> 01:22:04.790
MARISHA: Nine, but I thought you can't stack,

2030
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:05.623
MATT: It just means you're paralyzed

2031
01:22:05.623 --> 01:22:08.069
until the end of your next round again.

2032
01:22:08.069 --> 01:22:10.152
TALIESIN: But your round hasn't happened yet.

2033
01:22:10.152 --> 01:22:11.330
MARISHA: But my round hasn't happened.

2034
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:12.806
MATT: Correct, so it doesn't do much before you

2035
01:22:12.806 --> 01:22:13.639
at the moment.

2036
01:22:13.639 --> 01:22:14.935
LAURA: It would have fucked me, it won't fuck you.

2037
01:22:14.935 --> 01:22:19.555
LIAM: I just failed, blew Fortune's Favor, and failed again.

2038
01:22:19.555 --> 01:22:22.555
MATT: Okay, so you are paralyzed, buddy.

2039
01:22:23.499 --> 01:22:25.466
TRAVIS and LIAM: Fjuck!

2040
01:22:28.403 --> 01:22:30.636
MATT: All righty.
SAM: He got fjucked.

2041
01:22:30.636 --> 01:22:32.133
TRAVIS: You got fjucked.

2042
01:22:32.133 --> 01:22:32.966
SAM: (quickly) Eldritch Blast.

2043
01:22:35.139 --> 01:22:38.315
MATT: My shit got squared back here. There we go.

2044
01:22:38.315 --> 01:22:41.054
So we've got paralyzed there.

2045
01:22:41.054 --> 01:22:42.061
SAM: It's really good.

2046
01:22:42.061 --> 01:22:44.539
LAURA: It is so good and they taste like chocolate.

2047
01:22:44.539 --> 01:22:46.397
MATT: Who else? What'd you get?
TALIESIN: 18.

2048
01:22:46.397 --> 01:22:47.235
ASHLEY: 19.

2049
01:22:47.235 --> 01:22:48.784
MATT: 19. What'd you get?

2050
01:22:48.784 --> 01:22:50.650
TRAVIS: 23.

2051
01:22:50.650 --> 01:22:51.483
SAM: Is that an ear?

2052
01:22:51.483 --> 01:22:54.816
MATT: So it's just you two right here.

2053
01:22:58.035 --> 01:23:00.975
All righty. This one's going to use the last--

2054
01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:04.050
MARISHA: I'm still paralyzed, but also, but yeah.

2055
01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:05.443
MATT: -- last 20 feet of its movement,

2056
01:23:05.443 --> 01:23:10.443
it's going to swoop down and attempt to make

2057
01:23:10.455 --> 01:23:12.151
multiattack against you, Beau.

2058
01:23:12.151 --> 01:23:13.531
SAM: Oh no, but she's paralyzed.

2059
01:23:13.531 --> 01:23:14.879
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: It's not a critical.

2060
01:23:14.879 --> 01:23:16.487
MATT: Which gives it advantage to hit,

2061
01:23:16.487 --> 01:23:17.775
but it has disadvantage because it's so close

2062
01:23:17.775 --> 01:23:19.215
to the sunlight.

2063
01:23:19.215 --> 01:23:21.779
So it's a just a regular attack roll.

2064
01:23:21.779 --> 01:23:25.111
So one with its bite, and one with its claws.

2065
01:23:25.111 --> 01:23:29.095
The first attack is going to be 20 to hit.

2066
01:23:29.095 --> 01:23:30.314
MARISHA: Yeah, it hits.

2067
01:23:30.314 --> 01:23:32.699
LAURA: We're not--

2068
01:23:32.699 --> 01:23:33.700
SAM: Dead.

2069
01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.339
MATT: Paralyzed is an auto-crit if it's a melee attack.

2070
01:23:35.339 --> 01:23:36.236
LAURA: Right.

2071
01:23:36.236 --> 01:23:37.483
SAM: Wait, paralyzed is?

2072
01:23:37.483 --> 01:23:38.566
MATT: Is is.

2073
01:23:39.461 --> 01:23:40.294
MARISHA: It is?

2074
01:23:40.294 --> 01:23:42.794
TALIESIN: Yeah, but it's disadvantage.

2075
01:23:45.215 --> 01:23:46.879
MARISHA: But damage is still crit.

2076
01:23:46.879 --> 01:23:47.775
MATT: Correct.

2077
01:23:47.775 --> 01:23:48.608
MARISHA: Yeah.

2078
01:23:48.608 --> 01:23:49.441
SAM: She's still alive.

2079
01:23:51.319 --> 01:23:53.555
MATT: 20 points of piercing damage.

2080
01:23:53.555 --> 01:23:56.479
TALIESIN: Weird question. Can I negate any of this

2081
01:23:56.479 --> 01:23:59.271
with my stuff, does that technically,

2082
01:23:59.271 --> 01:24:00.938
can I cancel a crit?

2083
01:24:02.431 --> 01:24:05.011
TRAVIS: "With my stuff."

2084
01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:07.083
TALIESIN: If I use a--
MATT: Yeah, you could.

2085
01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:07.916
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

2086
01:24:08.821 --> 01:24:10.307
MATT: What's the range on it? 50 feet?

2087
01:24:10.307 --> 01:24:12.307
TALIESIN: I believe it's-- where is it?

2088
01:24:13.344 --> 01:24:15.342
LAURA: Definitely within his range.

2089
01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:16.969
TALIESIN: It's 30 feet.

2090
01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:20.985
MATT: 30 feet, she's just within 30 feet, yeah.

2091
01:24:20.985 --> 01:24:22.021
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to cancel that one,

2092
01:24:22.021 --> 01:24:22.981
I know I can't do all of them.

2093
01:24:22.981 --> 01:24:24.703
MATT: All right, so what did I just say it was--

2094
01:24:24.703 --> 01:24:25.536
MARISHA: 20.

2095
01:24:25.536 --> 01:24:27.446
MATT: 20, so you take instead,

2096
01:24:27.446 --> 01:24:28.469
MARISHA: Ten?

2097
01:24:28.469 --> 01:24:30.886
MATT: No, no, no, it would be

2098
01:24:32.145 --> 01:24:34.562
12 points of slashing damage.

2099
01:24:35.998 --> 01:24:37.242
TALIESIN: Hopefully that was the one to cancel.

2100
01:24:37.242 --> 01:24:38.325
TRAVIS: Every little bit helps.

2101
01:24:38.325 --> 01:24:41.477
MATT: Along with eight points of necrotic damage.

2102
01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:44.595
As the bite begins to infuse you with its terrible

2103
01:24:44.595 --> 01:24:46.697
cold shadow energy.

2104
01:24:46.697 --> 01:24:50.401
And now it's going to attack with its claw.

2105
01:24:50.401 --> 01:24:52.934
That's going to be 21.

2106
01:24:52.934 --> 01:24:55.267
TRAVIS: We need that radiant shit.

2107
01:24:56.532 --> 01:24:59.140
MATT: And that's going to be

2108
01:25:00.323 --> 01:25:02.609
24 points of slashing damage.

2109
01:25:02.609 --> 01:25:03.842
MARISHA: You're great.
TALIESIN: Wrong call.

2110
01:25:06.917 --> 01:25:09.809
It's necrotic, that's fair.

2111
01:25:09.809 --> 01:25:11.809
It's okay, I got a plan.

2112
01:25:14.399 --> 01:25:17.957
MATT: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50.

2113
01:25:19.595 --> 01:25:22.042
LIAM: I had plans to attack. Cat just cut off the tail.

2114
01:25:22.042 --> 01:25:22.875
MARISHA: Yeah!

2115
01:25:22.875 --> 01:25:25.349
MATT: Then swoop down here as part of it

2116
01:25:25.349 --> 01:25:28.599
and make itself into melee with Jester.

2117
01:25:29.862 --> 01:25:30.747
LIAM: That's not allowed.

2118
01:25:30.747 --> 01:25:32.881
MATT: Since you are prone, it has advantage

2119
01:25:32.881 --> 01:25:34.402
on its attacks against you, but it is within the sunlight

2120
01:25:34.402 --> 01:25:35.728
so it has disadvantage, so it cancels out

2121
01:25:35.728 --> 01:25:37.828
to a straight attack.

2122
01:25:37.828 --> 01:25:39.915
They are assuming you guys are easy prey

2123
01:25:39.915 --> 01:25:41.264
now that you've been knocked off your mounts,

2124
01:25:41.264 --> 01:25:42.508
and possibly paralyzed.

2125
01:25:42.508 --> 01:25:44.444
LAURA: But I'm not paralyzed because it wore off

2126
01:25:44.444 --> 01:25:45.277
at the end of my turn.

2127
01:25:45.277 --> 01:25:46.979
MATT: Correct, so these won't be crit to you.

2128
01:25:46.979 --> 01:25:48.916
That first attack is going to be a 25 to hit.

2129
01:25:48.916 --> 01:25:50.691
LAURA: Okay, yeah, mm-hmm.

2130
01:25:53.008 --> 01:25:54.091
MATT: So you take

2131
01:25:57.959 --> 01:26:00.292
11 points of piercing damage

2132
01:26:01.288 --> 01:26:04.038
plus nine points of necrotic damage.

2133
01:26:05.308 --> 01:26:06.148
LIAM: (Midwestern accent) "You okay there, Margie?"

2134
01:26:06.148 --> 01:26:08.481
"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just going to barf."

2135
01:26:11.744 --> 01:26:13.182
MATT: It's 18 to hit?

2136
01:26:13.182 --> 01:26:14.384
LAURA: 18 is my armor class.

2137
01:26:14.384 --> 01:26:15.685
MATT: That hits.

2138
01:26:15.685 --> 01:26:17.488
So the claw attack slashes into you,

2139
01:26:17.488 --> 01:26:18.660
it's just tearing into you now

2140
01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:20.220
with its claws and its bite.

2141
01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:24.195
You take 11 points of slashing damage.

2142
01:26:26.442 --> 01:26:27.704
SAM: No problem.

2143
01:26:27.704 --> 01:26:29.692
MATT: That's its turn.

2144
01:26:29.692 --> 01:26:32.025
All right, that brings us to

2145
01:26:35.705 --> 01:26:37.133
Beau and Caleb.

2146
01:26:37.133 --> 01:26:39.065
Beau, you're no longer paralyzed.

2147
01:26:39.065 --> 01:26:40.848
SAM: Hey!
LIAM: Sweet.

2148
01:26:40.848 --> 01:26:42.031
MATT: Caleb, you are no longer paralyzed.

2149
01:26:42.031 --> 01:26:43.845
LIAM: Sweet!
SAM: Hey!

2150
01:26:43.845 --> 01:26:46.919
MARISHA: Ow!

2151
01:26:46.919 --> 01:26:49.965
MATT: Fjord, and Caduceus on deck.

2152
01:26:49.965 --> 01:26:51.629
What are you doing, Fjord?

2153
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:53.787
You see this scratching and biting into

2154
01:26:53.787 --> 01:26:56.537
on both sides of you, both Beauregard and Jester

2155
01:26:56.537 --> 01:26:59.126
just being descended upon by these shadow beasts.

2156
01:26:59.126 --> 01:27:01.596
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll stand up.

2157
01:27:01.596 --> 01:27:02.966
MATT: That's half your movement there.

2158
01:27:02.966 --> 01:27:07.529
TRAVIS: And I will cast Charm Monster on both of them.

2159
01:27:07.529 --> 01:27:09.361
MATT: On both of them?

2160
01:27:09.361 --> 01:27:10.949
All right, what's the save?

2161
01:27:10.949 --> 01:27:13.416
TRAVIS: It is a wisdom,

2162
01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:15.480
17.

2163
01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.937
MATT: 17, all righty.

2164
01:27:16.937 --> 01:27:18.405
TRAVIS: But since we've been fighting them,

2165
01:27:18.405 --> 01:27:21.705
they have advantage on the wisdom saving throw.

2166
01:27:21.705 --> 01:27:24.705
MATT: That's right, good to know, all right.

2167
01:27:24.705 --> 01:27:25.538
First one.

2168
01:27:27.781 --> 01:27:30.114
First one is a ten, it fails.

2169
01:27:31.201 --> 01:27:33.869
TRAVIS: Which one, the one over by Jester or Beau?

2170
01:27:33.869 --> 01:27:36.361
MATT: The one by Jester, right there is charmed,

2171
01:27:36.361 --> 01:27:37.785
with a six and a one.

2172
01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:40.702
The one by Beauregard, natural one.

2173
01:27:42.809 --> 01:27:43.877
That is an 18.

2174
01:27:43.877 --> 01:27:45.001
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

2175
01:27:45.001 --> 01:27:47.581
MATT: So the one on Beauregard manages to resist it,

2176
01:27:47.581 --> 01:27:49.286
but the one to your right is charmed.

2177
01:27:49.286 --> 01:27:50.119
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

2178
01:27:50.119 --> 01:27:52.452
MATT: It pulls back from Jester.

2179
01:27:54.613 --> 01:27:55.981
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I'll just

2180
01:27:55.981 --> 01:27:58.121
tell it to back off.

2181
01:27:58.121 --> 01:27:59.429
MATT: Okay.

2182
01:27:59.429 --> 01:28:03.013
TRAVIS: And with my bonus action, I will cast

2183
01:28:03.013 --> 01:28:04.693
nothing, I'll stay there.

2184
01:28:04.693 --> 01:28:07.649
MATT: That finishes your go. Caduceus, what do you do?

2185
01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:10.570
TALIESIN: Did I see any of that just happen?

2186
01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:13.040
MATT: No, you're getting up off the ground.

2187
01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.165
TALIESIN: Okay!

2188
01:28:15.676 --> 01:28:17.505
MATT: You just impacted,

2189
01:28:17.505 --> 01:28:20.521
barely turned your head around

2190
01:28:20.521 --> 01:28:22.140
and now see them descending on the group.

2191
01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.118
You see Fjord casting something. That's what you see.

2192
01:28:24.118 --> 01:28:25.844
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and get--

2193
01:28:25.844 --> 01:28:28.397
can I get within-- I'm going to get as close

2194
01:28:28.397 --> 01:28:29.442
to that group as possible.

2195
01:28:29.442 --> 01:28:32.661
I want to get in the center of this whole mess.

2196
01:28:32.661 --> 01:28:34.445
MATT: 15, so you move one, two, three.

2197
01:28:34.445 --> 01:28:35.493
That's as close and you can get there.

2198
01:28:35.493 --> 01:28:37.726
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians.

2199
01:28:37.726 --> 01:28:40.233
MATT: Okay, Spirit Guardians, what's the range on that?

2200
01:28:40.233 --> 01:28:41.313
TALIESIN: 15 feet.

2201
01:28:41.313 --> 01:28:43.505
MATT: 15 feet, okay, so that hits those two right there.

2202
01:28:43.505 --> 01:28:45.873
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's yeah.

2203
01:28:45.873 --> 01:28:47.705
It's 15, they have 15 feet in every direction,

2204
01:28:47.705 --> 01:28:51.801
so that's wisdom.
LAURA: What do yours look like?

2205
01:28:51.801 --> 01:28:55.580
TALIESIN: They're my little bugs and little fireflies,

2206
01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:59.121
and little beetles and dragonflies and flip around.

2207
01:28:59.121 --> 01:29:00.150
MATT: All righty.

2208
01:29:00.150 --> 01:29:01.950
TALIESIN: That's a wisdom save.

2209
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:04.200
MATT: Wisdom save, right there.

2210
01:29:05.121 --> 01:29:07.909
Seven, failure on the charmed one.

2211
01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:10.641
And a 17 on the one over by Beauregard.

2212
01:29:10.641 --> 01:29:11.474
What's your DC?

2213
01:29:11.474 --> 01:29:12.307
TALIESIN: 17.

2214
01:29:12.307 --> 01:29:13.249
MATT: So yeah, it succeeds on that one.

2215
01:29:13.249 --> 01:29:16.951
TALIESIN: Okay, well that's fine, because that's all right.

2216
01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:18.752
Wisdom saving throw, failed save creature takes

2217
01:29:18.752 --> 01:29:20.669
3d8 radiant damage.

2218
01:29:26.464 --> 01:29:30.844
He takes 15 points of radiant damage

2219
01:29:30.844 --> 01:29:32.758
and the other one takes that halved.

2220
01:29:32.758 --> 01:29:33.591
MATT: Okay!

2221
01:29:36.752 --> 01:29:38.085
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's see.

2222
01:29:38.972 --> 01:29:40.164
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2223
01:29:40.164 --> 01:29:42.196
ASHLEY: Fuck yes!

2224
01:29:42.196 --> 01:29:43.144
MATT: To this one over here.

2225
01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:44.476
TALIESIN: It's just going to get eaten alive

2226
01:29:44.476 --> 01:29:47.644
by little glowing, radiant, celestial

2227
01:29:47.644 --> 01:29:51.364
beetles and bugs. There's just ladybugs, and just going.

2228
01:29:51.364 --> 01:29:53.792
MATT: A swarm of glowing radiant beetles

2229
01:29:53.792 --> 01:29:56.132
begin to just burrow into its shadowed body.

2230
01:29:56.132 --> 01:29:58.381
You can see as they tear and vanish in the inside.

2231
01:29:58.381 --> 01:30:01.006
It's like looking like someone placed a candle on the inside

2232
01:30:01.006 --> 01:30:02.143
of a piece of Swiss cheese,

2233
01:30:02.143 --> 01:30:03.652
where there's like dull glows from the inside

2234
01:30:03.652 --> 01:30:04.963
of the holes around it.

2235
01:30:04.963 --> 01:30:06.788
It shrieks and tries to fly off

2236
01:30:06.788 --> 01:30:08.171
and it gets about 20 feet in the air,

2237
01:30:08.171 --> 01:30:09.611
arcing before it just spins and

2238
01:30:09.611 --> 01:30:12.498
hits the ground like one of Daenerys' dragons.

2239
01:30:12.498 --> 01:30:13.825
TALIESIN: I'm just going to make eye contact,

2240
01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:15.804
with the other one now.

2241
01:30:15.804 --> 01:30:17.075
LIAM: Low blow.

2242
01:30:17.075 --> 01:30:19.295
TALIESIN: Oh, and when he starts his turn

2243
01:30:19.295 --> 01:30:21.331
in the range, it's also another attack.

2244
01:30:21.331 --> 01:30:22.547
MATT: You got it.

2245
01:30:22.547 --> 01:30:24.843
The other one gets blasted by it.

2246
01:30:24.843 --> 01:30:26.403
They're burning and burrowing into its skin,

2247
01:30:26.403 --> 01:30:28.007
the Daylight's blasting it in its eye

2248
01:30:28.007 --> 01:30:29.687
It's starting to look frantic.

2249
01:30:29.687 --> 01:30:32.446
That finishes Caduceus' go. It's now the moorbounders' turn.

2250
01:30:32.446 --> 01:30:35.599
They're no longer paralyzed.

2251
01:30:35.599 --> 01:30:37.895
Top of the round, Yasha, you're up.

2252
01:30:37.895 --> 01:30:39.645
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: Yeah, Yasha.

2253
01:30:40.623 --> 01:30:43.623
Kick some ass.
ASHLEY: I'm going to attack.

2254
01:30:44.747 --> 01:30:45.997
Ooh, nice. Okay.

2255
01:30:51.647 --> 01:30:52.699
23.

2256
01:30:52.699 --> 01:30:57.366
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage. First strike.

2257
01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:07.883
ASLHEY: Okay, ten, 12.

2258
01:31:08.803 --> 01:31:09.953
TRAVIS: I love the tension.

2259
01:31:11.155 --> 01:31:12.822
ASHLEY: 19 points of damage.

2260
01:31:14.157 --> 01:31:17.217
MATT: The first attack, so now that you've like slashed it

2261
01:31:17.217 --> 01:31:18.761
and caused it to fall down, you follow it up

2262
01:31:18.761 --> 01:31:20.488
with your first large swipe,

2263
01:31:20.488 --> 01:31:22.298
the Skingorger cutting across its chest.

2264
01:31:22.298 --> 01:31:24.237
It pulls back, almost doubling onto its back

2265
01:31:24.237 --> 01:31:25.289
from the sheer force of it,

2266
01:31:25.289 --> 01:31:26.969
both the blade and just the weight

2267
01:31:26.969 --> 01:31:28.661
of the metal behind it causing it

2268
01:31:28.661 --> 01:31:32.009
to almost topple. Second attack?

2269
01:31:32.009 --> 01:31:34.259
LAURA: You can still add a four.

2270
01:31:36.092 --> 01:31:37.675
MATT: The die is so pretty, but it keeps

2271
01:31:37.675 --> 01:31:38.922
getting cocked on its own

2272
01:31:38.922 --> 01:31:41.249
because of the inner dice. It's weird.

2273
01:31:41.249 --> 01:31:43.288
ASHLEY: Okay, so 18--

2274
01:31:43.288 --> 01:31:45.307
or no, ten.

2275
01:31:45.307 --> 01:31:46.657
Ugh!

2276
01:31:46.657 --> 01:31:47.721
11.

2277
01:31:47.721 --> 01:31:49.878
MATT: 11 misses, unfortunately.

2278
01:31:49.878 --> 01:31:50.878
Still getting used to this weapon.

2279
01:31:50.878 --> 01:31:52.485
The first impact, you get so cocky

2280
01:31:52.485 --> 01:31:54.533
that you pull out for the second swing

2281
01:31:54.533 --> 01:31:56.465
and as you do, the creature leaps back

2282
01:31:56.465 --> 01:31:58.777
by a foot and it smashes in the ground

2283
01:31:58.777 --> 01:32:00.860
sending shards of rock and dirt

2284
01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:02.165
up into the air around it and

2285
01:32:02.165 --> 01:32:05.343
leaving this large groove in the floor in front of it.

2286
01:32:05.343 --> 01:32:07.076
ASHLEY: Ugh! Okay.

2287
01:32:08.449 --> 01:32:09.857
MATT: Is that your turn?
ASHLEY: That's my turn.

2288
01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:11.973
MATT: All righty, finishing Yasha's go. Nott.

2289
01:32:11.973 --> 01:32:13.802
Jester on deck.

2290
01:32:13.802 --> 01:32:16.145
SAM: The fly swatter will strike again

2291
01:32:16.145 --> 01:32:17.540
for six points of damage.

2292
01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:19.818
TRAVIS: Yeah, get it.

2293
01:32:19.818 --> 01:32:22.221
MATT: (slaps) (shrieks)

2294
01:32:22.221 --> 01:32:24.829
SAM: And I will stick out and shoot the same one

2295
01:32:24.829 --> 01:32:26.195
that's engaged with Yasha.

2296
01:32:26.195 --> 01:32:27.881
MATT: All right, so you move out to the side.

2297
01:32:27.881 --> 01:32:29.072
SAM: Ew!

2298
01:32:29.072 --> 01:32:30.382
And I'll miss.

2299
01:32:30.382 --> 01:32:31.382
MATT: What'd you roll?

2300
01:32:31.382 --> 01:32:32.661
SAM: 13.

2301
01:32:32.661 --> 01:32:35.049
MATT: 13, goes wide.

2302
01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:39.020
SAM: Reload, shoot again, that's a 21.

2303
01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:40.609
MATT: That does hit.

2304
01:32:40.609 --> 01:32:42.305
SAM: And I think I still get sneak attack damage.

2305
01:32:42.305 --> 01:32:43.889
MATT: You do because it is engaged with Yasha still.

2306
01:32:43.889 --> 01:32:44.889
SAM: Okay, good.

2307
01:32:46.037 --> 01:32:47.631
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.
SAM: I know, right?

2308
01:32:47.631 --> 01:32:48.786
LAURA: Wow!

2309
01:32:48.786 --> 01:32:49.881
TALIESIN: That's gross.

2310
01:32:49.881 --> 01:32:53.058
SAM: 24 plus six is 30.

2311
01:32:53.058 --> 01:32:54.213
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2312
01:32:54.213 --> 01:32:56.181
(cheering)

2313
01:32:56.181 --> 01:33:00.156
SAM: I will just say to the creature:

2314
01:33:01.849 --> 01:33:03.513
You're grounded! Nope.

2315
01:33:03.513 --> 01:33:06.254
(laughter)

2316
01:33:06.254 --> 01:33:08.385
TRAVIS: All of a sudden, it's back alive.

2317
01:33:08.385 --> 01:33:10.125
MATT: As you release it, shouting that,

2318
01:33:10.125 --> 01:33:11.803
it glances in your direction.

2319
01:33:11.803 --> 01:33:14.341
One of its two yellow eyes blinks out

2320
01:33:14.341 --> 01:33:15.508
and it

2321
01:33:17.637 --> 01:33:19.331
just falls to the ground, no longer moving.

2322
01:33:19.331 --> 01:33:24.073
SAM: The fly swatter just hits it a few more times.

2323
01:33:24.073 --> 01:33:26.007
MATT: The shadow that emanates from it begins to dissipate

2324
01:33:26.007 --> 01:33:27.357
and slowly fade just leaving the

2325
01:33:27.357 --> 01:33:29.774
leathery carcass behind.

2326
01:33:30.717 --> 01:33:31.905
All righty.

2327
01:33:31.905 --> 01:33:34.349
SAM: Action, bonus, and then movement. I'll just

2328
01:33:34.349 --> 01:33:36.329
clock around to the other side of the tree.

2329
01:33:36.329 --> 01:33:37.319
MATT: All right.

2330
01:33:37.319 --> 01:33:39.019
SAM: (quick footsteps) That's it.

2331
01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:41.811
MATT: And Jester, you're up.

2332
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:45.985
LAURA: I sit up on the ground so I'm just like sitting there

2333
01:33:45.985 --> 01:33:49.638
and I see the other one attacking Beau and I go:

2334
01:33:49.638 --> 01:33:52.789
Ah! And I Guiding Bolt it again at 2nd-level.

2335
01:33:52.789 --> 01:33:53.682
MATT: Roll for an attack.

2336
01:33:53.682 --> 01:33:54.832
MARISHA: Up the butt!

2337
01:33:54.832 --> 01:33:55.905
SAM: Up the butt!

2338
01:33:55.905 --> 01:33:58.665
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's 16 plus nine.

2339
01:33:58.665 --> 01:34:01.343
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2340
01:34:01.343 --> 01:34:05.792
TRAVIS: (auctioneer-style nonsense)

2341
01:34:05.792 --> 01:34:07.825
LAURA: Eleven, twelve,

2342
01:34:07.825 --> 01:34:10.185
14 points of radiant damage.

2343
01:34:10.185 --> 01:34:11.881
MATT: 14 points of radiant damage.

2344
01:34:11.881 --> 01:34:13.728
SAM: (auctioneer-style nonsense)

2345
01:34:13.728 --> 01:34:15.790
MATT: As it's finished slashing through Beauregard,

2346
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:18.763
it watches like its allies getting

2347
01:34:18.763 --> 01:34:20.069
destroyed left and right.

2348
01:34:20.069 --> 01:34:22.757
There's the large number of divine insects

2349
01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:23.865
that are burrowing into its body

2350
01:34:23.865 --> 01:34:26.143
and spins towards you as you blast it with a Guiding Bolt

2351
01:34:26.143 --> 01:34:28.065
causing part of its wing to burn as its shoulder

2352
01:34:28.065 --> 01:34:29.909
is now in radiant flame.

2353
01:34:29.909 --> 01:34:31.080
It's looking really hurt.

2354
01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:32.751
(shrieking)

2355
01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:34.213
(wings flapping)

2356
01:34:34.213 --> 01:34:35.772
That your turn?

2357
01:34:35.772 --> 01:34:37.829
You're still on the ground, by the way.

2358
01:34:37.829 --> 01:34:39.762
LAURA: I'll stand up.

2359
01:34:39.762 --> 01:34:42.140
TRAVIS: From your tush. (blasting)

2360
01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:43.665
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I want to do.

2361
01:34:43.665 --> 01:34:44.582
MATT: All righty.

2362
01:34:45.449 --> 01:34:47.389
Finishing your turn, it's now the creature's turn.

2363
01:34:47.389 --> 01:34:49.141
TALIESIN: And it immediately has to roll a save.

2364
01:34:49.141 --> 01:34:49.974
MATT: It does.

2365
01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:53.505
A natural 17 plus three.

2366
01:34:53.505 --> 01:34:57.233
TALIESIN: Okay, so it saves and only takes--

2367
01:34:57.233 --> 01:34:59.233
yeah, that's really mean.

2368
01:35:01.205 --> 01:35:04.681
17 in half, 17 points of radiant damage halved.

2369
01:35:04.681 --> 01:35:07.733
MATT: Okay, so it takes 17 total.

2370
01:35:07.733 --> 01:35:08.752
LAURA: Eight points?

2371
01:35:08.752 --> 01:35:10.145
TALIESIN: No, well then-- but then it's--

2372
01:35:10.145 --> 01:35:12.431
but it still takes seven points of radiant damage.

2373
01:35:12.431 --> 01:35:14.565
Yeah, it takes 17, actually, radiant points of damage

2374
01:35:14.565 --> 01:35:15.853
at the top of this turn.

2375
01:35:15.853 --> 01:35:18.209
MATT: Correct wait, so 17 was--
TALIESIN: 17 halved.

2376
01:35:18.209 --> 01:35:20.066
MATT: Halved, right, so that makes it 17.

2377
01:35:20.066 --> 01:35:21.945
Okay, how do you want to do this?

2378
01:35:21.945 --> 01:35:23.805
(cheering)

2379
01:35:23.805 --> 01:35:26.214
TALIESIN: I just I want to slowly walk over to it

2380
01:35:26.214 --> 01:35:27.792
and just pet it on the head

2381
01:35:27.792 --> 01:35:30.638
and shh, it's okay, it's okay.

2382
01:35:30.638 --> 01:35:32.392
MATT: As you're petting it, it's freaking out

2383
01:35:32.392 --> 01:35:35.433
and tries to fly away and it kicks off of you

2384
01:35:35.433 --> 01:35:37.876
and it gets about 10 feet before it spirals

2385
01:35:37.876 --> 01:35:39.241
and slams into the ground.

2386
01:35:39.241 --> 01:35:41.261
You watch the light beetles seeming to

2387
01:35:41.261 --> 01:35:43.497
burn and burrow in and out of its body

2388
01:35:43.497 --> 01:35:47.293
like a rapid fire video of a creature being decomposed

2389
01:35:47.293 --> 01:35:49.210
by a series of insects.

2390
01:35:50.057 --> 01:35:52.548
SAM: ♪ The jitterbugs are eating my heart ♪

2391
01:35:56.969 --> 01:35:59.413
SAM: Quick, get to the moorbounders.

2392
01:35:59.413 --> 01:36:01.961
I got to loot the bodies.

2393
01:36:01.961 --> 01:36:03.085
MATT: All right, go ahead.

2394
01:36:03.085 --> 01:36:04.301
SAM: I got to see how much gold they carry

2395
01:36:04.301 --> 01:36:06.370
in their pouches and pockets.

2396
01:36:06.370 --> 01:36:07.203
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

2397
01:36:07.203 --> 01:36:08.094
TRAVIS: That fucking face paint

2398
01:36:08.094 --> 01:36:09.419
is bleeding into his bloodstream.

2399
01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:11.293
SAM: 30.

2400
01:36:11.293 --> 01:36:13.988
MATT: All right, you watch as Nott is

2401
01:36:13.988 --> 01:36:16.416
plunging her arms into the wounds of these creatures

2402
01:36:16.416 --> 01:36:18.749
and just pulling organs out.

2403
01:36:20.588 --> 01:36:23.604
You do find a cold node in the chest.

2404
01:36:23.604 --> 01:36:24.935
SAM: Node?

2405
01:36:24.935 --> 01:36:26.992
MATT: With a 30 investigation check,

2406
01:36:26.992 --> 01:36:30.084
you find the heart of the beast.

2407
01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:32.676
It's freezing to the touch and-- do you pull it out?

2408
01:36:32.676 --> 01:36:35.196
You're just, you're feeling it on the inside of the body.

2409
01:36:35.196 --> 01:36:36.876
SAM: Do I have the strength to pull it out?

2410
01:36:36.876 --> 01:36:37.884
MATT: We can find out, do you want to try?

2411
01:36:37.884 --> 01:36:38.992
SAM: Yeah, let's do this.

2412
01:36:38.992 --> 01:36:41.316
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a strength check.

2413
01:36:41.316 --> 01:36:42.149
SAM: Natural 20.

2414
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:43.680
(cheering)

2415
01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:45.184
MATT: Are you serious?

2416
01:36:45.184 --> 01:36:48.372
TALIESIN: This is how Skeletors happen, god damn it.

2417
01:36:48.372 --> 01:36:49.708
Do you want Skeletor?

2418
01:36:49.708 --> 01:36:51.067
This is how we get a Skeletor.

2419
01:36:51.067 --> 01:36:51.900
SAM: I'm not going to pull it out.

2420
01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:53.208
I'm going to push it through.

2421
01:36:54.862 --> 01:36:55.928
MATT: So the creatures body is here,

2422
01:36:55.928 --> 01:36:57.892
and there's one wound on one side of its chest

2423
01:36:57.892 --> 01:37:00.026
and suddenly it-- (wet sound)

2424
01:37:01.338 --> 01:37:04.912
and this black, charcoal-like looking heart

2425
01:37:04.912 --> 01:37:07.533
just slaps onto the ground next to it.

2426
01:37:07.533 --> 01:37:09.632
TALIESIN: Don't touch it mom, it's evil.

2427
01:37:09.632 --> 01:37:10.940
SAM: I'll go ahead and pick it up

2428
01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.698
and see what it feels like.

2429
01:37:12.698 --> 01:37:14.152
MATT: It's freezing to the touch.

2430
01:37:14.152 --> 01:37:17.180
You actually do take two points of cold damage

2431
01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:20.224
in the process of grabbing it and pushing it through.

2432
01:37:21.416 --> 01:37:23.463
LAURA: Do we have something to put that in?

2433
01:37:23.463 --> 01:37:25.312
LIAM: We always have rags.

2434
01:37:25.312 --> 01:37:28.608
TALIESIN: If we have anything glass maybe?

2435
01:37:28.608 --> 01:37:29.748
LIAM: Wrap it in this.

2436
01:37:29.748 --> 01:37:32.152
MATT: The heart of a gloomstalker for whatever that may be,

2437
01:37:32.152 --> 01:37:33.152
you can keep tabs that you have

2438
01:37:33.152 --> 01:37:34.469
the heart of a gloomstalker.

2439
01:37:34.469 --> 01:37:36.719
MARISHA: Heart of a gloomstalker.

2440
01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.220
LAURA: I help Yarnball stand up and pet her

2441
01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.657
and say I'm sorry.

2442
01:37:42.657 --> 01:37:44.460
MATT: Yarnball looks a bit shaken.

2443
01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:45.992
LAURA: You're okay, you're okay, it's okay.

2444
01:37:45.992 --> 01:37:47.458
You can eat some of the gloomstalkers,

2445
01:37:47.458 --> 01:37:49.266
whatever those things are--

2446
01:37:49.266 --> 01:37:50.866
MATT: It just digs into it immediately.

2447
01:37:50.866 --> 01:37:51.699
ASHLEY: Yeah, there's one for each.

2448
01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:56.567
MARISHA: I just stay laying on my back and just sigh

2449
01:37:56.567 --> 01:37:58.759
in disappointment and embarrassment.

2450
01:37:58.759 --> 01:38:00.009
TRAVIS: 'Sup with you?

2451
01:38:01.532 --> 01:38:03.299
MARISHA: Just fucking useless.

2452
01:38:03.299 --> 01:38:05.939
TRAVIS: What do you mean? That was a group effort.

2453
01:38:05.939 --> 01:38:06.885
It wasn't so bad.

2454
01:38:06.885 --> 01:38:10.816
LAURA: You totally distracted one with your paralyzed body.

2455
01:38:10.816 --> 01:38:11.816
ASHLEY: You did good. Beau.

2456
01:38:12.692 --> 01:38:15.092
MATT: Yasha reaches out to help you up.

2457
01:38:15.092 --> 01:38:16.300
ASHLEY: Come on.

2458
01:38:18.516 --> 01:38:19.799
(yelling)

2459
01:38:21.277 --> 01:38:23.793
TRAVIS: Shit Yasha, fuck. I mean, come on.

2460
01:38:23.793 --> 01:38:25.359
Ratchet it down a little.

2461
01:38:26.293 --> 01:38:28.210
Now go get-- go get her.

2462
01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:32.068
MARISHA: I was just paralyzed. Why?

2463
01:38:32.068 --> 01:38:33.778
LIAM: (fast footfalls) Again!

2464
01:38:35.328 --> 01:38:37.787
TALIESIN: I'm going to run a Prayer of Healing

2465
01:38:37.787 --> 01:38:40.449
really quickly. Just a little for anybody who needs it.

2466
01:38:40.449 --> 01:38:41.437
LAURA: I need it.

2467
01:38:41.437 --> 01:38:42.354
TALIESIN: So that's--

2468
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:47.693
That's 14 points to any-- 14 healing--

2469
01:38:47.693 --> 01:38:49.885
points of healing to anybody who needs it.

2470
01:38:49.885 --> 01:38:51.113
ASHLEY: Anybody?

2471
01:38:51.113 --> 01:38:52.657
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can do up to six people

2472
01:38:52.657 --> 01:38:55.368
and I don't think we have six people...

2473
01:38:55.368 --> 01:38:56.986
Actually, let's see, one, two, three, four, five,

2474
01:38:56.986 --> 01:38:58.066
SAM: Are you including yourself?

2475
01:38:58.066 --> 01:38:59.891
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to-- I'll sit it out, I'm fine.

2476
01:38:59.891 --> 01:39:03.242
MARISHA: Can I take seconds? Is that allowed?

2477
01:39:03.242 --> 01:39:05.986
TALIESIN: I can work on seconds, if you need them.

2478
01:39:05.986 --> 01:39:07.982
TALIESIN: I'm fine, I only took three points of damage.

2479
01:39:07.982 --> 01:39:08.815
TRAVIS: Me too.

2480
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:13.874
LIAM: Where are we in relation to that tower

2481
01:39:13.874 --> 01:39:15.542
that Nott pointed out?

2482
01:39:15.542 --> 01:39:17.324
MATT: Make a perception check.

2483
01:39:17.324 --> 01:39:19.154
TRAVIS: Can we get our moorbounders up?

2484
01:39:19.154 --> 01:39:20.547
MATT: Moorbounders are back up.

2485
01:39:20.547 --> 01:39:22.982
LAURA: And they're feasted, so they're happy.

2486
01:39:22.982 --> 01:39:24.404
SAM: Oh yeah, they can eat the bodies.

2487
01:39:24.404 --> 01:39:26.059
SAM: (as Sam) Oh, tell them not to eat the--

2488
01:39:26.059 --> 01:39:27.396
(as Nott) tell them not to eat the hearts.

2489
01:39:27.396 --> 01:39:28.744
LAURA: Don't eat the heart.

2490
01:39:28.744 --> 01:39:30.952
SAM: Wait they can't understand common, I suppose.

2491
01:39:30.952 --> 01:39:32.947
LAURA: Caduceus tell them not to eat the hearts.

2492
01:39:32.947 --> 01:39:35.645
TALIESIN: Oh, can you guys, can you leave the hearts for us?

2493
01:39:35.645 --> 01:39:37.912
It's the cold bit in the middle that doesn't--

2494
01:39:37.912 --> 01:39:40.028
MATT: Much like Beauty and the Beast

2495
01:39:40.028 --> 01:39:42.933
when he's like eating the bowl of porridge,

2496
01:39:42.933 --> 01:39:47.492
there's just gloomstalker guts running out of its face.

2497
01:39:47.492 --> 01:39:48.450
TALIESIN: We're not going to be mad

2498
01:39:48.450 --> 01:39:49.575
or anything, we're just--

2499
01:39:49.575 --> 01:39:52.880
LAURA: They might hurt you or something, yeah.

2500
01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.619
MATT: It begins to rain.

2501
01:39:54.619 --> 01:39:56.237
The rain of the storm has hit you.

2502
01:39:56.237 --> 01:39:59.628
As a wave comes past, it is freezing cold

2503
01:39:59.628 --> 01:40:01.232
and immediately it's starting to run

2504
01:40:01.232 --> 01:40:04.248
the black blood of these creatures

2505
01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:07.125
to slowly spill across the floor

2506
01:40:07.125 --> 01:40:08.867
of the Badlands here.

2507
01:40:08.867 --> 01:40:11.594
MARISHA: I use it to wipe the blood off of me.

2508
01:40:11.594 --> 01:40:12.527
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you another

2509
01:40:12.527 --> 01:40:13.818
Cure Wounds just for the--

2510
01:40:13.818 --> 01:40:15.134
MARISHA: Thank you.

2511
01:40:15.134 --> 01:40:16.872
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.

2512
01:40:16.872 --> 01:40:18.905
TALIESIN: Have another eight points just to--

2513
01:40:18.905 --> 01:40:20.088
MARISHA: Thank you.

2514
01:40:20.088 --> 01:40:21.541
LIAM: We're going to be miserable in this rain

2515
01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:22.847
in about five minutes.

2516
01:40:22.847 --> 01:40:24.183
LAURA: Yeah, let's keep going.

2517
01:40:24.183 --> 01:40:25.755
LIAM: 18 on my perception.

2518
01:40:25.755 --> 01:40:29.715
MATT: 18, with the rain, it takes you a moment

2519
01:40:29.715 --> 01:40:32.807
and you can make out the vague bit of a dark shape,

2520
01:40:32.807 --> 01:40:35.823
but you're unable to really no more than just--

2521
01:40:35.823 --> 01:40:37.127
Caduceus mentioned something in this direction

2522
01:40:37.127 --> 01:40:39.123
and that's probably it, but you can't really tell

2523
01:40:39.123 --> 01:40:40.040
what it is.

2524
01:40:41.115 --> 01:40:42.991
MARISHA: I pull out the copied map again.

2525
01:40:42.991 --> 01:40:45.433
Anything look relevant?

2526
01:40:48.815 --> 01:40:51.759
MATT: Based on the design with the large T that was

2527
01:40:51.759 --> 01:40:54.214
on the map, looks like it could be representative of that

2528
01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:56.463
shape that you're pointing at there.

2529
01:40:56.463 --> 01:40:58.305
LIAM: Also earlier, you described the,

2530
01:40:58.305 --> 01:41:01.472
like the frequency of these spires?

2531
01:41:02.807 --> 01:41:06.455
Getting closer together, not uniform, but

2532
01:41:06.455 --> 01:41:07.307
a little more?

2533
01:41:07.307 --> 01:41:10.775
MATT: Like every thousand or so feet,

2534
01:41:10.775 --> 01:41:12.754
you'll probably come across one.

2535
01:41:12.754 --> 01:41:13.955
Maybe over two thousand so they're starting

2536
01:41:13.955 --> 01:41:16.538
to become more and more common.

2537
01:41:19.487 --> 01:41:21.496
SAM: Is there still daylight? Should we keep going?

2538
01:41:21.496 --> 01:41:23.357
MATT: It's still daylight. You still have another

2539
01:41:23.357 --> 01:41:24.340
four hours or so.

2540
01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.253
SAM: Let's keep going.

2541
01:41:26.253 --> 01:41:27.086
ASHLEY: I wonder how much further

2542
01:41:27.086 --> 01:41:28.992
until we're out of this place.

2543
01:41:28.992 --> 01:41:31.787
TALIESIN: I'm going to let whatever's left of the Daylight

2544
01:41:31.787 --> 01:41:34.951
spell run for a minute anyway before canceling that anyway.

2545
01:41:34.951 --> 01:41:36.135
MATT: So you guys take some time to--

2546
01:41:36.135 --> 01:41:38.445
are you taking a short rest or are you moving forward?

2547
01:41:38.445 --> 01:41:39.528
TRAVIS: Short rest.

2548
01:41:41.356 --> 01:41:42.331
SAM: I think we're all healed up.

2549
01:41:42.331 --> 01:41:43.967
TALIESIN: Yeah, move forward.

2550
01:41:43.967 --> 01:41:44.800
MATT: Okay.

2551
01:41:45.691 --> 01:41:47.763
TRAVIS: We warlocks love those short rests.

2552
01:41:47.763 --> 01:41:49.655
MATT: Love those short rests, man.

2553
01:41:49.655 --> 01:41:51.675
LIAM: Do you need one as well?

2554
01:41:51.675 --> 01:41:53.639
ASHLEY: Yeah, if you want to take a short rest, we can.

2555
01:41:53.639 --> 01:41:56.023
LAURA: We've only got a certain amount of-- okay, yeah.

2556
01:41:56.023 --> 01:41:58.723
SAM: Sure, we'll just wait here while you rest.

2557
01:41:58.723 --> 01:41:59.556
TALIESIN: I mean we've already been healing

2558
01:41:59.556 --> 01:42:01.047
and stuff for a little bit.

2559
01:42:01.047 --> 01:42:03.163
MATT: So continue your rest for an additional

2560
01:42:03.163 --> 01:42:04.635
30 or so minutes which is the length of the

2561
01:42:04.635 --> 01:42:07.767
Daylight spell anyway. That gives you a short rest.

2562
01:42:07.767 --> 01:42:09.643
Anybody who wishes to, you can do some hit dice

2563
01:42:09.643 --> 01:42:12.147
for yourself if you'd like.

2564
01:42:12.147 --> 01:42:12.980
That does--

2565
01:42:15.059 --> 01:42:16.979
That does impact your travel time slightly,

2566
01:42:16.979 --> 01:42:20.396
so you do lose an hour of daylight in your journey.

2567
01:42:21.763 --> 01:42:23.022
But completing the short rest,

2568
01:42:23.022 --> 01:42:25.815
you mount back up to your moorbounders.

2569
01:42:25.815 --> 01:42:27.387
I saw with your Prayer of Healing, you healed--

2570
01:42:27.387 --> 01:42:29.219
what was it before, right?

2571
01:42:29.219 --> 01:42:30.899
TALIESIN: With the Prayer of Healing?

2572
01:42:30.899 --> 01:42:32.067
MATT: How much did you heal with that?

2573
01:42:32.067 --> 01:42:33.868
It was like 14?
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was like 14.

2574
01:42:33.868 --> 01:42:35.547
MATT: Okay, so the moorbounders are back up to full again

2575
01:42:35.547 --> 01:42:36.815
because they also took damage from falling

2576
01:42:36.815 --> 01:42:38.832
and impacting on the ground.

2577
01:42:38.832 --> 01:42:40.346
LIAM: I use Arcane Recovery to get back all my slots.

2578
01:42:40.346 --> 01:42:41.429
MATT: You got it.

2579
01:42:43.181 --> 01:42:45.059
Gathering your things, back up on to your mounts,

2580
01:42:45.059 --> 01:42:47.367
you continue on forward through the rain.

2581
01:42:47.367 --> 01:42:48.687
What pace are you taking?

2582
01:42:48.687 --> 01:42:50.518
Slow pace, normal pace, fast pace?

2583
01:42:50.518 --> 01:42:52.167
LAURA: Fast pace?

2584
01:42:52.167 --> 01:42:53.743
LIAM: Are we checking out this thing?

2585
01:42:53.743 --> 01:42:55.799
SAM: What thing? The thing that I saw?

2586
01:42:55.799 --> 01:42:57.315
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: That's where we're heading.

2587
01:42:57.315 --> 01:42:59.423
LIAM: I don't know if we want to

2588
01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:00.590
race up on it.

2589
01:43:01.535 --> 01:43:03.035
SAM: I want to get to it before nightfall.

2590
01:43:03.035 --> 01:43:05.760
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, it's still pretty far away.

2591
01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.527
LAURA: Let's book it.

2592
01:43:07.527 --> 01:43:09.059
TALIESIN: Oh, the notion was we sleep

2593
01:43:09.059 --> 01:43:10.183
and then maybe see it first thing in the morning

2594
01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:11.787
so we get as close as we possibly can

2595
01:43:11.787 --> 01:43:13.840
before bedding down.

2596
01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.779
MATT: So you are at fast pace?

2597
01:43:15.779 --> 01:43:17.292
SAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: Apparently.

2598
01:43:17.292 --> 01:43:21.034
MATT: Okay, continuing on another hour.

2599
01:43:22.584 --> 01:43:26.579
A second hour, the rain itself now heavy sheets

2600
01:43:26.579 --> 01:43:28.275
soaking you all to the bone,

2601
01:43:28.275 --> 01:43:32.033
seeping into every piece of armor and clothing you have.

2602
01:43:33.299 --> 01:43:35.143
The rain is thick.

2603
01:43:35.143 --> 01:43:37.947
It's water, but it also has

2604
01:43:37.947 --> 01:43:41.459
almost a weird, very faint oily residue to it

2605
01:43:41.459 --> 01:43:43.765
like whatever-- like not just water

2606
01:43:43.765 --> 01:43:47.143
was carried up this precipitation.

2607
01:43:47.143 --> 01:43:49.935
You've known this slick rain

2608
01:43:49.935 --> 01:43:53.067
comes through occasionally in this area

2609
01:43:53.067 --> 01:43:55.107
pulling up some of the various

2610
01:43:55.107 --> 01:43:59.757
nasty chemicals and oily remnants of the battle fields

2611
01:43:59.757 --> 01:44:00.894
of Xhorhas.

2612
01:44:00.894 --> 01:44:04.070
TRAVIS: It doesn't have an odor, does it?

2613
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:06.894
MATT: Make a medicine check.

2614
01:44:06.894 --> 01:44:08.454
LIAM: Are we walking through kerosene right now?

2615
01:44:08.454 --> 01:44:10.542
SAM: Is this Chernobyl happening right now?

2616
01:44:10.542 --> 01:44:11.466
TRAVIS: Seven.

2617
01:44:11.466 --> 01:44:12.726
MATT: It has an odor, but you're unable to really

2618
01:44:12.726 --> 01:44:15.110
recognize what it is. It's very very faint.

2619
01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:17.165
Very very faint.

2620
01:44:17.165 --> 01:44:21.158
You're not worried. It's just different

2621
01:44:21.158 --> 01:44:24.158
than the rain you've experienced so far in Xhorhas.

2622
01:44:26.646 --> 01:44:29.253
You continue forward for a second hour

2623
01:44:29.253 --> 01:44:31.432
and keeping a view, you can definitely now

2624
01:44:31.432 --> 01:44:34.014
start making the shape of this looming object

2625
01:44:34.014 --> 01:44:36.245
that was on the horizon when you first spotted it

2626
01:44:36.245 --> 01:44:37.282
by the tortoise shell.

2627
01:44:37.282 --> 01:44:40.642
SAM: See I told you it's like a big, square dick.

2628
01:44:40.642 --> 01:44:41.766
TRAVIS: I don't think you said that before.

2629
01:44:41.766 --> 01:44:43.193
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure this is the first time

2630
01:44:43.193 --> 01:44:44.542
you mentioned any--

2631
01:44:44.542 --> 01:44:46.986
SAM: Just like I said.
LAURA: I feel like you said it.

2632
01:44:46.986 --> 01:44:51.398
MATT: The size is hard to gauge through the storm,

2633
01:44:51.398 --> 01:44:54.174
but you're now certain that it is indeed a tree.

2634
01:44:54.174 --> 01:44:55.117
TRAVIS: Oh.
SAM: Oh.

2635
01:44:55.117 --> 01:44:56.406
TRAVIS: It is a tree.

2636
01:44:56.406 --> 01:44:58.866
MATT: Though the scale is staggering.

2637
01:44:58.866 --> 01:45:00.384
Probably stands somewhere between

2638
01:45:00.384 --> 01:45:02.481
four to five hundred feet tall.

2639
01:45:02.481 --> 01:45:05.823
With a lush leafed canopy

2640
01:45:07.347 --> 01:45:10.462
that defies the nature of these desolate barrens.

2641
01:45:10.462 --> 01:45:12.210
SAM: Is it just one single tree?

2642
01:45:12.210 --> 01:45:17.177
MATT: One single massive tree in the middle of nowhere.

2643
01:45:20.321 --> 01:45:22.333
LAURA: It's the Wildmother.

2644
01:45:22.333 --> 01:45:23.713
SAM: What?
TALIESIN: Oh, of course.

2645
01:45:23.713 --> 01:45:25.296
SAM: What do you mean?

2646
01:45:26.565 --> 01:45:28.001
TALIESIN: What does what mean?

2647
01:45:28.001 --> 01:45:29.171
SAM: <i>That</i> is the Wildmother?

2648
01:45:29.171 --> 01:45:30.957
The Wildmother is a tree?

2649
01:45:30.957 --> 01:45:32.902
TALIESIN: Wildmother is a lot of things.

2650
01:45:32.902 --> 01:45:35.319
MATT: If anyone here is religion--

2651
01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:41.695
proficient with religion, go ahead and make a check for me.

2652
01:45:41.695 --> 01:45:44.005
SAM: You once told me that the people in my village

2653
01:45:44.005 --> 01:45:45.925
might like the Wildmother.

2654
01:45:45.925 --> 01:45:46.758
TALIESIN: Seven.

2655
01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.627
Not proficient.
MATT: You've never heard of this.

2656
01:45:53.701 --> 01:45:54.661
MARISHA: How far away are we?

2657
01:45:54.661 --> 01:45:56.411
SAM: I'm not proficient.

2658
01:45:57.959 --> 01:46:00.150
MATT: Wildmother-- you know of the Wildmother,

2659
01:46:00.150 --> 01:46:02.589
but you haven't done any extensive studying, unfortunately.

2660
01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:05.341
Mainly due to the fact that she's not really

2661
01:46:05.341 --> 01:46:07.174
allowed in the Empire.

2662
01:46:08.733 --> 01:46:10.758
MARISHA: How far away are we from it?

2663
01:46:13.921 --> 01:46:15.921
MATT: Make a survival check.

2664
01:46:18.614 --> 01:46:20.265
MARISHA: It was almost cool, nine.

2665
01:46:20.265 --> 01:46:21.753
MATT: Nine, you're not sure.

2666
01:46:21.753 --> 01:46:25.141
It's hard to gauge. It's <i>so</i> big at this distance

2667
01:46:25.141 --> 01:46:27.393
that you're like, either that's really close

2668
01:46:27.393 --> 01:46:30.901
or it's bigger than you think and it's much further.

2669
01:46:30.901 --> 01:46:32.613
And either way your brain kind of breaks

2670
01:46:32.613 --> 01:46:34.446
a bit at the prospect.

2671
01:46:37.018 --> 01:46:39.193
The distance is a little odd with the storm blowing through.

2672
01:46:39.193 --> 01:46:41.654
And now you're starting see

2673
01:46:41.654 --> 01:46:42.746
arcs of lighting in the distance

2674
01:46:42.746 --> 01:46:45.351
as the storm is coming through.

2675
01:46:45.351 --> 01:46:47.906
LIAM: You're getting any kind of feeling from this?

2676
01:46:47.906 --> 01:46:49.523
TALIESIN: Well I mean, yeah, look at that.

2677
01:46:49.523 --> 01:46:51.174
LIAM: A good one though, or a bad one?

2678
01:46:51.174 --> 01:46:53.186
TALIESIN: It's nothing but a good feeling. Look at that.

2679
01:46:53.186 --> 01:46:54.218
MARISHA: What about you, Yasha?

2680
01:46:54.218 --> 01:46:56.595
TRAVIS: Lighting hits it and it bursts into flames.

2681
01:46:56.595 --> 01:46:58.690
MARISHA: No!
TRAVIS: Fuck!

2682
01:46:58.690 --> 01:47:01.157
LIAM: You got your chocolate in my peanut butter.

2683
01:47:01.157 --> 01:47:03.074
TALIESIN: It demands sacrifice.

2684
01:47:04.230 --> 01:47:05.346
TRAVIS: It's nothing but a good feeling.

2685
01:47:05.346 --> 01:47:07.237
(explosion sound) Oh!

2686
01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.894
ASHLEY: Would I have heard about this massive tree?

2687
01:47:10.894 --> 01:47:12.288
MATT: No.

2688
01:47:12.288 --> 01:47:14.435
You've not traveled this far north.

2689
01:47:14.435 --> 01:47:16.383
ASHLEY: I've never heard of this. I mean

2690
01:47:16.383 --> 01:47:19.266
I've obviously never traveled this far north.

2691
01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:20.582
But I've--

2692
01:47:21.723 --> 01:47:24.259
This is-- I've never seen anything like this before.

2693
01:47:24.259 --> 01:47:26.403
LIAM: What time of day is it?

2694
01:47:26.403 --> 01:47:28.669
MATT: At this point, it's maybe

2695
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:30.678
three o'clock in the afternoon.

2696
01:47:30.678 --> 01:47:32.151
You'll be looking a dusk beginning in the next

2697
01:47:32.151 --> 01:47:33.484
couple of hours.

2698
01:47:34.603 --> 01:47:36.295
ASHLEY: Should we keep moving towards it?

2699
01:47:36.295 --> 01:47:37.363
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2700
01:47:37.363 --> 01:47:39.727
I want to see it up close.

2701
01:47:39.727 --> 01:47:41.768
LAURA: I bet a lot of things are attracted

2702
01:47:41.768 --> 01:47:43.251
to the tree, though.

2703
01:47:44.091 --> 01:47:46.043
Or maybe things are scared of the tree

2704
01:47:46.043 --> 01:47:47.627
like they're scared of the sunlight.

2705
01:47:47.627 --> 01:47:49.244
SAM: Oh yeah.

2706
01:47:49.244 --> 01:47:50.811
MARISHA: I mean there's got to be people there.

2707
01:47:50.811 --> 01:47:53.167
This feels like something slightly

2708
01:47:53.167 --> 01:47:54.500
civilized, right?

2709
01:47:55.551 --> 01:47:56.451
TALIESIN: I think this looks like

2710
01:47:56.451 --> 01:47:58.163
the exact opposite of civilized.

2711
01:47:58.163 --> 01:48:00.208
LAURA: Let's go find out.

2712
01:48:00.208 --> 01:48:02.707
MATT: All right, so you're moving fast paced towards it.

2713
01:48:02.707 --> 01:48:03.540
All righty.

2714
01:48:05.119 --> 01:48:06.572
You guys rushing through the rain,

2715
01:48:06.572 --> 01:48:08.779
pelting your face, stinging due to

2716
01:48:08.779 --> 01:48:12.019
the speed you're traveling and the wind and arc of it.

2717
01:48:12.019 --> 01:48:13.715
Your face is starting to go numb

2718
01:48:13.715 --> 01:48:16.893
from both the temperature and the continuous impact.

2719
01:48:16.893 --> 01:48:18.259
TRAVIS: Can we keep crap eye out for like any

2720
01:48:18.259 --> 01:48:20.315
tortoise shells or anything else?

2721
01:48:20.315 --> 01:48:21.679
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make a perception check

2722
01:48:21.679 --> 01:48:22.687
with disadvantage.

2723
01:48:22.687 --> 01:48:23.915
TALIESIN: I will join you in that.

2724
01:48:23.915 --> 01:48:26.239
MARISHA: Any scouts, any people?

2725
01:48:26.239 --> 01:48:27.123
MATT: That's kind of what this is,

2726
01:48:27.123 --> 01:48:29.347
a general like watch as they go ahead.

2727
01:48:29.347 --> 01:48:31.059
SAM: I'm gonna put on my mask to block the water.

2728
01:48:31.059 --> 01:48:32.723
TRAVIS: 18 with disadvantage.

2729
01:48:32.723 --> 01:48:33.890
17 and a 16.

2730
01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:36.551
TALIESIN: 11 with disadvantage.

2731
01:48:36.551 --> 01:48:37.899
ASHLEY: You rolled a natural 20.

2732
01:48:37.899 --> 01:48:38.732
TALIESIN: I know.

2733
01:48:38.732 --> 01:48:41.078
MATT: I'm sorry, buddy. It's the rain.

2734
01:48:41.078 --> 01:48:42.339
MARISHA: Nine.

2735
01:48:42.339 --> 01:48:44.575
MATT: All right, you keep an eye out.

2736
01:48:44.575 --> 01:48:46.419
It's really hard to see with the rain

2737
01:48:46.419 --> 01:48:48.371
and the movement and being distracted

2738
01:48:48.371 --> 01:48:51.611
by the continuous stinging of the storm in your face.

2739
01:48:51.611 --> 01:48:53.719
Nott, you go ahead and cover the front of your face

2740
01:48:53.719 --> 01:48:56.871
the best you can to help keep that at bay.

2741
01:48:56.871 --> 01:48:58.479
You keep an eye out there.

2742
01:48:58.479 --> 01:49:00.812
You guys travel for an hour.

2743
01:49:01.839 --> 01:49:02.995
The second hour, and the shape's getting

2744
01:49:02.995 --> 01:49:05.229
larger and larger and closer.

2745
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:08.755
Eventually, you can see the light source behind the trees

2746
01:49:08.755 --> 01:49:11.379
begin to dim further and further,

2747
01:49:11.379 --> 01:49:13.229
signifying that sunset is coming.

2748
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:15.646
LAURA: We should set up the bubble before it gets dark.

2749
01:49:15.646 --> 01:49:16.670
Those things come out.

2750
01:49:16.670 --> 01:49:18.241
MATT: Fjord, you're looking back

2751
01:49:18.241 --> 01:49:19.365
and glancing around the area,

2752
01:49:19.365 --> 01:49:20.207
you don't notice any tortoise shells.

2753
01:49:20.207 --> 01:49:22.502
You pass by one of the spires and

2754
01:49:22.502 --> 01:49:25.039
glance up at the top and you see it's

2755
01:49:25.039 --> 01:49:27.319
dark and shadowed towards the peak.

2756
01:49:27.319 --> 01:49:29.194
And right as you guys ride by at a fast pace,

2757
01:49:29.194 --> 01:49:30.695
which is not a stealthy pace,

2758
01:49:30.695 --> 01:49:33.155
you watch as the shadows

2759
01:49:33.155 --> 01:49:38.155
unfold as a cluster of two, three,

2760
01:49:38.205 --> 01:49:42.955
four, five gloomstalkers have taken notice of your pace.

2761
01:49:44.095 --> 01:49:45.476
And they all begin to

2762
01:49:46.351 --> 01:49:50.251
all detach from the spire and begin to

2763
01:49:50.251 --> 01:49:52.727
swarm behind you as you're traveling forward.

2764
01:49:52.727 --> 01:49:54.318
TRAVIS: How far away from the tree?

2765
01:49:54.318 --> 01:49:56.611
LAURA: How far away are they from us?

2766
01:49:56.611 --> 01:49:59.983
MATT: They're about 150 feet behind you,

2767
01:49:59.983 --> 01:50:03.525
so at a full fast pace, you guys will be keeping pace.

2768
01:50:03.525 --> 01:50:06.199
MARISHA: I look at the map again.

2769
01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:08.700
Are there any dots marked that feel like

2770
01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:10.471
they could be nearby?

2771
01:50:10.471 --> 01:50:11.787
MATT: No, on the scaled map--

2772
01:50:11.787 --> 01:50:13.595
this was a very, very simple map

2773
01:50:13.595 --> 01:50:16.847
and seemed to be the entirety of the Barbed Fields,

2774
01:50:16.847 --> 01:50:18.499
so right now the only thing is the T.

2775
01:50:18.499 --> 01:50:20.861
TRAVIS: As long as we don't stop, they won't catch us.

2776
01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:24.991
SAM: Can we cast the dome while we're moving?

2777
01:50:24.991 --> 01:50:27.251
TALIESIN: Nope.
LIAM: No.

2778
01:50:27.251 --> 01:50:31.091
I need time and quiet for that.

2779
01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:34.043
SAM: How about this. How about

2780
01:50:34.043 --> 01:50:38.035
me and Caleb jump off, you guys keep riding,

2781
01:50:38.035 --> 01:50:41.960
we'll cast, you lead them all around for 10 minutes.

2782
01:50:43.027 --> 01:50:44.295
TALIESIN: Terrible idea.

2783
01:50:44.295 --> 01:50:45.640
TRAVIS: Nott yells this over the wind.

2784
01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.835
We're like, "Shut up, Nott! Just ride!"

2785
01:50:47.835 --> 01:50:49.771
SAM: We're going to jump off and stay here.

2786
01:50:49.771 --> 01:50:52.035
LAURA: Just keep riding.
SAM: All right.

2787
01:50:52.035 --> 01:50:53.880
MATT: You can actually hear, both between the rain

2788
01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.235
and the recent realization of these creatures

2789
01:50:56.235 --> 01:50:58.538
and the conversation,

2790
01:50:58.538 --> 01:51:00.021
Yarnball's like--

2791
01:51:00.021 --> 01:51:01.623
(whimpering)

2792
01:51:01.623 --> 01:51:03.073
LAURA: Oh no, Yarnball.

2793
01:51:03.073 --> 01:51:04.908
MATT: And they seem to be a little bit freaked out

2794
01:51:04.908 --> 01:51:07.567
from what had transpired the previous battle.

2795
01:51:07.567 --> 01:51:09.179
I don't think they've ever been

2796
01:51:09.179 --> 01:51:11.887
thrown at full speed from paralyzation.

2797
01:51:11.887 --> 01:51:13.343
Make an animal handling check for me.

2798
01:51:13.343 --> 01:51:16.019
LAURA: Oh no, with advantage?

2799
01:51:16.019 --> 01:51:17.293
MATT: No.

2800
01:51:17.293 --> 01:51:19.618
(laughter)

2801
01:51:22.187 --> 01:51:26.055
TALIESIN: Oh God it was so-- it went everywhere!

2802
01:51:26.055 --> 01:51:27.494
It went everywhere!

2803
01:51:27.494 --> 01:51:31.335
That was so much to watch. It was so much.

2804
01:51:31.335 --> 01:51:33.702
LIAM: It was like the wheel on The Price is Right.

2805
01:51:33.702 --> 01:51:34.793
LAURA: Seven.

2806
01:51:34.793 --> 01:51:36.757
MATT: Seven. All right, so as you guys are moving forward,

2807
01:51:36.757 --> 01:51:38.608
Yarnball's starting to split off a bit

2808
01:51:38.608 --> 01:51:40.439
and trying to-- is now overtaken

2809
01:51:40.439 --> 01:51:43.199
by the primal instinct to preserve himself

2810
01:51:43.199 --> 01:51:45.210
and so the group is moving forward,

2811
01:51:45.210 --> 01:51:46.187
Yarnball's starting to peel off,

2812
01:51:46.187 --> 01:51:47.945
and you're having a hard time controlling him.

2813
01:51:47.945 --> 01:51:48.914
TALIESIN: Yarnball, Yarnball come on.

2814
01:51:48.914 --> 01:51:50.450
We need you. We need you, buddy. Come on.

2815
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:52.668
MATT: Just moving, moving.

2816
01:51:52.668 --> 01:51:54.829
TRAVIS: What is your fucking animal doing?

2817
01:51:54.829 --> 01:51:55.943
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, hold on,

2818
01:51:55.943 --> 01:51:59.492
I'm going to cast-- let's see if I can do this.

2819
01:51:59.492 --> 01:52:00.914
SAM: Hellish Rebuke.

2820
01:52:00.914 --> 01:52:02.740
(laughter)

2821
01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:04.205
TALIESIN: Heel!

2822
01:52:04.205 --> 01:52:07.939
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command on Yarnball.

2823
01:52:07.939 --> 01:52:10.636
MATT: Okay, what's the will save on that? Is it wisdom?

2824
01:52:10.636 --> 01:52:12.093
LAURA: It's wisdom, 17.

2825
01:52:12.093 --> 01:52:12.926
MATT: 17.

2826
01:52:15.591 --> 01:52:17.758
No, that is a straight 12.

2827
01:52:18.651 --> 01:52:20.527
What do you command Yarnball to do?

2828
01:52:20.527 --> 01:52:22.908
LAURA: Stay with the group, Yarnball.

2829
01:52:22.908 --> 01:52:25.191
MATT: Corrects and begins to move back towards the group.

2830
01:52:25.191 --> 01:52:26.431
TRAVIS: Ooh, slick.

2831
01:52:26.431 --> 01:52:27.590
ASHLEY: Good boy.

2832
01:52:29.143 --> 01:52:29.976
MATT: Merging with the group and everyone

2833
01:52:29.976 --> 01:52:32.704
back together again, Yarnball seems to shake off the

2834
01:52:32.704 --> 01:52:34.916
momentary fear and you guys are still moving.

2835
01:52:34.916 --> 01:52:36.371
Looking back behind you, you can see now

2836
01:52:36.371 --> 01:52:37.903
all five of them

2837
01:52:37.903 --> 01:52:39.927
swarming between each other and occasionally--

2838
01:52:39.927 --> 01:52:44.927
(shrieking)

2839
01:52:45.631 --> 01:52:47.071
You can see the

2840
01:52:47.071 --> 01:52:48.570
almost yellow trails

2841
01:52:48.570 --> 01:52:49.831
from where their eyes are moving

2842
01:52:49.831 --> 01:52:52.123
against the darker, ever growing darkened shadow

2843
01:52:52.123 --> 01:52:56.373
of the clouds above you in the coming evening sky.

2844
01:52:58.019 --> 01:53:00.504
Another flash of blue lighting a little closer nearby,

2845
01:53:00.504 --> 01:53:02.895
the thunder is getting closer to the flash.

2846
01:53:02.895 --> 01:53:04.903
LAURA: Any shelter, any shelter?

2847
01:53:04.903 --> 01:53:07.003
MATT: You continue to move.

2848
01:53:07.003 --> 01:53:10.240
Another 30 minutes or so, pushing close.

2849
01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:11.847
The tree is now becoming this

2850
01:53:11.847 --> 01:53:13.707
massive, massive shape. There's no light source,

2851
01:53:13.707 --> 01:53:16.543
so the tree is now just becoming this large--

2852
01:53:16.543 --> 01:53:19.723
slowly converting to this giant shadow

2853
01:53:19.723 --> 01:53:21.296
that you're approaching.

2854
01:53:21.296 --> 01:53:24.169
Occasionally with other flashes of light,

2855
01:53:24.169 --> 01:53:27.627
you can see the bright blue and white outline of it

2856
01:53:27.627 --> 01:53:30.403
in the immediate flash reflection of the lightning

2857
01:53:30.403 --> 01:53:31.855
before it goes dark once more.

2858
01:53:31.855 --> 01:53:33.191
And what was once a welcoming tree

2859
01:53:33.191 --> 01:53:34.706
is now starting to look more and more ominous

2860
01:53:34.706 --> 01:53:37.025
the closer you get to it.

2861
01:53:37.025 --> 01:53:38.391
And you now see your moorbounders

2862
01:53:38.391 --> 01:53:39.387
are starting to get a little tired.

2863
01:53:39.387 --> 01:53:40.691
They're pace is starting to

2864
01:53:40.691 --> 01:53:43.765
not slacken yet, but can hear the breathing.

2865
01:53:43.765 --> 01:53:45.881
(panting)

2866
01:53:45.881 --> 01:53:49.422
MARISHA: Yasha, think that god of yours can give us a hand?

2867
01:53:49.422 --> 01:53:51.943
You know, (lightning sound) (screaming)

2868
01:53:51.943 --> 01:53:53.203
ASHLEY: I can try.

2869
01:53:53.203 --> 01:53:54.870
TRAVIS: I have an idea.

2870
01:53:56.007 --> 01:53:59.394
I'll-- no, nevermind. I've got to save it.

2871
01:53:59.394 --> 01:54:01.195
I only have two spell slots.

2872
01:54:01.195 --> 01:54:04.211
SAM: You don't know how to save nothing.

2873
01:54:04.211 --> 01:54:05.794
ASHLEY: I'm going to hold my--

2874
01:54:08.778 --> 01:54:10.578
my, my-- I can't think of the word.

2875
01:54:10.578 --> 01:54:12.328
MATT: Symbol?
ASHLEY: My symbol!

2876
01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:16.903
I'm going to hold my symbol and I'm going to just--

2877
01:54:18.061 --> 01:54:19.311
Hey, Stormlord?

2878
01:54:22.065 --> 01:54:23.880
We could use a little help right now.

2879
01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:26.582
I don't know if this is how this works, but

2880
01:54:26.582 --> 01:54:31.082
if you want to show up and you know, use your lightning.

2881
01:54:33.094 --> 01:54:36.842
Kill these things, we would just greatly appreciate it,

2882
01:54:36.842 --> 01:54:39.302
but you know if not we can kill them,

2883
01:54:39.302 --> 01:54:41.969
but you know, either way, please.

2884
01:54:44.106 --> 01:54:46.106
MATT: Okay, you keep riding.

2885
01:54:48.731 --> 01:54:51.358
TRAVIS: As we're trucking, I'll let my eyes roll back

2886
01:54:51.358 --> 01:54:55.638
and I'll say "Barlgura," and summon a greater demon

2887
01:54:55.638 --> 01:54:57.869
right behind us as we're hauling ass

2888
01:54:57.869 --> 01:55:01.846
and just tell him to fucking make a big fucking racket.

2889
01:55:01.846 --> 01:55:03.358
MARISHA: Yes.
ASHLEY: What?

2890
01:55:03.358 --> 01:55:04.454
MARISHA: Yes.

2891
01:55:04.454 --> 01:55:07.110
MATT: You hear the horrible curling voice

2892
01:55:07.110 --> 01:55:09.376
of some demonic language

2893
01:55:09.376 --> 01:55:11.086
spill Forth from Fjord's mouth.

2894
01:55:11.086 --> 01:55:13.258
His eyes go dark momentarily.

2895
01:55:13.258 --> 01:55:15.492
And then behind you, there's a flash of purple,

2896
01:55:15.492 --> 01:55:18.285
as this series of arcane lines draw across

2897
01:55:18.285 --> 01:55:19.467
this open gate.

2898
01:55:19.467 --> 01:55:22.018
And from the billowing black, purple smoke,

2899
01:55:22.018 --> 01:55:23.451
you watch the massive demonic

2900
01:55:23.451 --> 01:55:24.797
gorilla-like shape of a barlgura--

2901
01:55:24.797 --> 01:55:27.646
(slamming, grunting sounds)

2902
01:55:27.646 --> 01:55:29.970
slamming into the ground and scream up at the sky.

2903
01:55:29.970 --> 01:55:31.303
You now watch as--

2904
01:55:38.894 --> 01:55:40.219
No, that's cocked.

2905
01:55:40.219 --> 01:55:41.052
Cocked.

2906
01:55:42.023 --> 01:55:43.348
LIAM: (east coast accent) That's a cock.

2907
01:55:43.348 --> 01:55:45.048
LAURA: (east coast accent) That's cacked. That's a cack.

2908
01:55:45.048 --> 01:55:46.634
MATT: Four of the five of them notice it

2909
01:55:46.634 --> 01:55:49.886
and swoop down towards it with just one more

2910
01:55:49.886 --> 01:55:51.769
that's still barreling towards the rest of you.

2911
01:55:51.769 --> 01:55:53.098
TRAVIS: All right.
SAM: Yes.

2912
01:55:53.098 --> 01:55:54.514
MATT: As that happens, you guys

2913
01:55:54.514 --> 01:55:56.268
continue your pace and you hear behind you

2914
01:55:56.268 --> 01:56:00.692
shrieking, tearing, roaring, screaming, this--

2915
01:56:00.692 --> 01:56:02.524
this absolute fray to the point where you could

2916
01:56:02.524 --> 01:56:04.322
no longer see the creatures,

2917
01:56:04.322 --> 01:56:05.731
you no longer see the barlgura,

2918
01:56:05.731 --> 01:56:07.516
the fight's began to dissipate in sound now.

2919
01:56:07.516 --> 01:56:10.537
There's just the one (flapping).

2920
01:56:10.537 --> 01:56:12.628
LAURA: How far away is it from us now?

2921
01:56:12.628 --> 01:56:16.792
MATT: It's still about 175 to 200 feet away.

2922
01:56:16.792 --> 01:56:18.852
LIAM: I'm giving Nott the Gift of Alacrity

2923
01:56:18.852 --> 01:56:21.611
and readying the Drift Globe in my hand.

2924
01:56:21.611 --> 01:56:26.080
LAURA: I'm readying Guiding Bolt for if it gets close.

2925
01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.328
TALIESIN: And a Sacred Flame.

2926
01:56:27.328 --> 01:56:29.715
MARISHA: I ready my middle finger.

2927
01:56:29.715 --> 01:56:32.304
TRAVIS: Yeah, the worst of them all!

2928
01:56:32.304 --> 01:56:34.552
MATT: The shape of the tree is getting

2929
01:56:34.552 --> 01:56:37.548
closer and closer and closer.

2930
01:56:37.548 --> 01:56:40.808
You can start to get a sense of scope and size.

2931
01:56:40.808 --> 01:56:43.180
You now have a definitive idea from where--

2932
01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:46.117
you can see detail on the massive roots

2933
01:56:46.117 --> 01:56:48.040
that pour out from its base

2934
01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:52.164
and dig deeply into the broken badlands that surrounds it.

2935
01:56:52.164 --> 01:56:55.180
You can hear the heaving beating of the wings,

2936
01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:58.513
the rain smashing all around you and the

2937
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:03.814
moorbounders are now getting tired and starting to slow,

2938
01:57:04.856 --> 01:57:07.328
pace begins to draw back slower.

2939
01:57:07.328 --> 01:57:09.880
TALIESIN: I'm going to just try and cast-- just to

2940
01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:12.528
help them out a little bit, I'm just going to do a--

2941
01:57:12.528 --> 01:57:13.778
I'm going to do a--

2942
01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.780
where is it? Healing Word--

2943
01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:19.398
LAURA: Mass Healing Word?
TALIESIN: Mass Healing Word, yeah.

2944
01:57:19.398 --> 01:57:20.404
LAURA: It's a fourth level.

2945
01:57:20.404 --> 01:57:21.633
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2946
01:57:21.633 --> 01:57:23.868
TALIESIN: On the moorbounders.

2947
01:57:23.868 --> 01:57:27.320
MATT: Okay, you heal whatever wounds they may have had,

2948
01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:30.784
but it does not get rid of any exhaustion, unfortunately,

2949
01:57:30.784 --> 01:57:32.119
so they're still slowing.

2950
01:57:32.119 --> 01:57:35.900
The single gloomstalker is starting to catch up.

2951
01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.520
LAURA: As soon as it's within 120 feet--

2952
01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:39.080
MATT: Which is not very long.

2953
01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:40.684
Go for it, roll an attack.

2954
01:57:40.684 --> 01:57:42.080
LAURA: I'm doing this at third level.

2955
01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.281
MATT: Correct, you're also at a disadvantage on this attack,

2956
01:57:44.281 --> 01:57:46.744
because of the heavy rain, have given it--

2957
01:57:46.744 --> 01:57:49.716
actually no sorry, it just has a bonus to its

2958
01:57:49.716 --> 01:57:52.220
armor class, plus two. So regular attack.

2959
01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:53.194
LIAM: We're in the dark now, right?

2960
01:57:53.194 --> 01:57:54.696
MATT: It's almost pitch black now.

2961
01:57:54.696 --> 01:57:57.254
Like there's a little bit of fading light.

2962
01:57:59.857 --> 01:58:01.148
LAURA: 17.

2963
01:58:01.148 --> 01:58:02.287
MATT: 17?

2964
01:58:02.287 --> 01:58:04.431
Its AC is 15 plus two because of that,

2965
01:58:04.431 --> 01:58:06.333
so 17 it hits exactly.

2966
01:58:06.333 --> 01:58:07.598
LAURA: So I hit it or I don't hit it?

2967
01:58:07.598 --> 01:58:09.306
MATT: No, you just hit it.

2968
01:58:09.306 --> 01:58:10.678
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2969
01:58:10.678 --> 01:58:11.720
LAURA: All right.

2970
01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:12.867
TRAVIS: Radiant the fuck up.

2971
01:58:12.867 --> 01:58:13.700
LAURA: 6d6.

2972
01:58:15.431 --> 01:58:17.019
SAM: 66 damage.

2973
01:58:17.019 --> 01:58:17.852
LAURA: 66--!

2974
01:58:19.302 --> 01:58:21.039
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Ooh!

2975
01:58:21.039 --> 01:58:23.805
LAURA: 12, 16, 18, holy shit.

2976
01:58:23.805 --> 01:58:26.547
22, 20-- oh yeah, you're right.

2977
01:58:26.547 --> 01:58:27.731
Is it 26?

2978
01:58:27.731 --> 01:58:30.207
26 points of radiant damage.

2979
01:58:30.207 --> 01:58:31.207
MATT: All right.

2980
01:58:32.619 --> 01:58:33.819
As it's swooping towards you,

2981
01:58:33.819 --> 01:58:35.003
you all watch as you're all riding,

2982
01:58:35.003 --> 01:58:37.119
the moorbounders are slowing getting sluggish,

2983
01:58:37.119 --> 01:58:39.458
there's a general sense of, "All right,

2984
01:58:39.458 --> 01:58:40.659
what's happening next?"

2985
01:58:40.659 --> 01:58:42.863
As soon as you have that thought,

2986
01:58:42.863 --> 01:58:46.059
this bright vibrant bolt of divine energy

2987
01:58:46.059 --> 01:58:47.903
just blasts forth.
LAURA: It's pink.

2988
01:58:47.903 --> 01:58:51.718
MATT: It is a pink radiant bolt of energy

2989
01:58:51.718 --> 01:58:53.887
that flies straight backwards and you watch it

2990
01:58:53.887 --> 01:58:57.155
burst in this small blast wave,

2991
01:58:57.155 --> 01:59:00.127
this echoing sphere of energy that explodes

2992
01:59:00.127 --> 01:59:02.480
out from the impact of this gloomstalker.

2993
01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:04.206
Its body is now completely surrounded

2994
01:59:04.206 --> 01:59:06.680
in burning pink divine energy and it's

2995
01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.163
flapping and freaking out

2996
01:59:08.163 --> 01:59:10.479
and it is horribly hurt in one hit.

2997
01:59:10.479 --> 01:59:12.233
It immediately spins around

2998
01:59:12.233 --> 01:59:14.458
and begins to make its way back the way behind you.

2999
01:59:14.458 --> 01:59:16.552
ALL: Nice!

3000
01:59:16.552 --> 01:59:18.802
TRAVIS: Bugging out, bugging out.

3001
01:59:21.843 --> 01:59:23.635
MATT: With that, the moorbounders' pace is slowed,

3002
01:59:23.635 --> 01:59:26.515
but they're still moving at half speed.

3003
01:59:26.515 --> 01:59:30.219
About 30 minutes past dusk, the night has come.

3004
01:59:30.219 --> 01:59:33.339
You approach probably about 100 feet

3005
01:59:33.339 --> 01:59:34.915
from where the tree begins.

3006
01:59:34.915 --> 01:59:36.561
MARISHA: 100 feet, we're that close?

3007
01:59:36.561 --> 01:59:37.507
SAM: Let's go check it out.

3008
01:59:37.507 --> 01:59:38.404
LAURA: In the dark?

3009
01:59:38.404 --> 01:59:40.025
SAM: We have light spells.

3010
01:59:40.025 --> 01:59:42.055
LIAM: I have this, I can't see anything.

3011
01:59:42.055 --> 01:59:43.863
SAM: Why don't you cast the globe first?

3012
01:59:43.863 --> 01:59:46.683
LIAM: Don't waste it, Caduceus. I have this.

3013
01:59:46.683 --> 01:59:47.732
TALIESIN: All right.

3014
01:59:47.732 --> 01:59:48.673
MARISHA: I have a feeling there's

3015
01:59:48.673 --> 01:59:50.299
going to be people here, man.

3016
01:59:50.299 --> 01:59:53.527
TRAVIS: Or-- yeah, if we're lucky.
MARISHA: Bad guys, yeah.

3017
01:59:53.527 --> 01:59:54.924
You don't have a landmark this big

3018
01:59:54.924 --> 01:59:56.573
in the middle of nowhere and it doesn't attract

3019
01:59:56.573 --> 01:59:58.403
everyone else in the vicinity.

3020
01:59:58.403 --> 01:59:59.728
TRAVIS: Is it about five or six

3021
01:59:59.728 --> 02:00:01.753
in the afternoon, seven, later?

3022
02:00:01.753 --> 02:00:06.168
MATT: At this point, I'd say it's closer to eight o'clock.

3023
02:00:07.187 --> 02:00:09.227
TALIESIN: Might be good to have a place to rest, regardless.

3024
02:00:09.227 --> 02:00:10.199
What do you think?

3025
02:00:10.199 --> 02:00:12.555
LIAM: Yeah, but I can't see and I'm worried

3026
02:00:12.555 --> 02:00:15.091
to light this up and draw other things to us.

3027
02:00:15.091 --> 02:00:17.431
Does anyone have a--

3028
02:00:17.431 --> 02:00:18.947
MARISHA: I put on my goggles.

3029
02:00:18.947 --> 02:00:20.926
TRAVIS: I can make it real dark around you.

3030
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:23.415
SAM: What do you-- you want light?

3031
02:00:23.415 --> 02:00:24.887
LIAM: I need to be able to read.

3032
02:00:24.887 --> 02:00:26.387
SAM: We have torches.

3033
02:00:27.227 --> 02:00:28.711
TALIESIN: I have that. I can just--

3034
02:00:28.711 --> 02:00:30.775
I'm going to do a very basic Light spell.

3035
02:00:30.775 --> 02:00:31.935
MARISHA: Do you want to borrow my goggles?

3036
02:00:31.935 --> 02:00:34.634
Before you do that, you want to just borrow my goggles?

3037
02:00:34.634 --> 02:00:37.439
LIAM: It's been so long. I put under a rag

3038
02:00:37.439 --> 02:00:40.472
a little globule of light

3039
02:00:40.472 --> 02:00:42.107
and let that float

3040
02:00:42.107 --> 02:00:44.039
just above my book on the ground and start

3041
02:00:44.039 --> 02:00:46.076
spending the next 10 minutes to--

3042
02:00:46.076 --> 02:00:49.187
MATT: Okay, the rag is immediately soaked from the rain.

3043
02:00:49.187 --> 02:00:51.279
You pull open the book. Your book has been treated.

3044
02:00:51.279 --> 02:00:54.238
It's fine. Spell pages are meant to resist water.

3045
02:00:56.487 --> 02:00:58.127
So you begin to go through and recite,

3046
02:00:58.127 --> 02:00:59.175
and then what are you casting?

3047
02:00:59.175 --> 02:01:00.825
LIAM: Leomund's Tiny Hut.

3048
02:01:00.825 --> 02:01:01.825
MATT: All right.

3049
02:01:03.271 --> 02:01:04.797
You wait about 10 minutes or so.

3050
02:01:04.797 --> 02:01:06.031
SAM: Should I go scout while we're waiting?

3051
02:01:06.031 --> 02:01:07.727
Should I go scout alone?
LAURA: No.

3052
02:01:07.727 --> 02:01:09.135
SAM: It's 100 feet. I could just turn invisible,

3053
02:01:09.135 --> 02:01:10.460
look around for a while, and--

3054
02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:12.226
TRAVIS: She said no, Jesus.

3055
02:01:12.226 --> 02:01:13.868
SAM: But I'm asking again.

3056
02:01:13.868 --> 02:01:18.793
(laughing)

3057
02:01:21.085 --> 02:01:22.502
LAURA: Turn invisible.

3058
02:01:24.689 --> 02:01:25.689
SAM: Invisible.

3059
02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:29.748
MATT: Without getting the response Nott wanted,

3060
02:01:29.748 --> 02:01:32.600
she vanishes from sight and disappears.

3061
02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:33.925
TRAVIS: Oh man.

3062
02:01:33.925 --> 02:01:36.468
MARISHA: I'll meet you, just start screaming or something.

3063
02:01:36.468 --> 02:01:37.472
SAM: Okay.

3064
02:01:37.472 --> 02:01:40.700
MATT: So while you're in the process of casting your spell,

3065
02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:44.012
Nott you, gone from sight,

3066
02:01:44.012 --> 02:01:46.588
begin to slowly, quietly make your way

3067
02:01:46.588 --> 02:01:49.608
towards this ominous solitary tree

3068
02:01:49.608 --> 02:01:51.871
at the center of the Barbed Fields.

3069
02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:54.632
And that's where we go ahead and take our break.

3070
02:01:54.632 --> 02:01:56.551
LIAM: (as Nott) Do you think I should go invisible?

3071
02:01:56.551 --> 02:01:57.642
(as Fjord) No.

3072
02:01:59.104 --> 02:02:02.252
MATT: Yep, that's par for the course there.

3073
02:02:02.252 --> 02:02:05.479
All right, we have our giveaway

3074
02:02:05.479 --> 02:02:07.979
for the Wyrmwood. This is the--

3075
02:02:08.925 --> 02:02:12.664
this is the Bolivian Rosewood tabletop dice tray here.

3076
02:02:12.664 --> 02:02:16.040
Very pretty leather interior from our friends at Wyrmwood.

3077
02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:17.552
This will be going to one lucky winner.

3078
02:02:17.552 --> 02:02:19.360
To enter this during the break,

3079
02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:22.771
enter into the chat today's code, which is "Danger".

3080
02:02:22.771 --> 02:02:25.049
Enter the word "Danger" into the chat once.

3081
02:02:25.049 --> 02:02:27.903
More than once and you will be disqualified, unfortunately.

3082
02:02:27.903 --> 02:02:30.072
Once again, US and Canada only, excluding Quebec

3083
02:02:30.072 --> 02:02:31.280
because of stupid laws.

3084
02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:32.753
SAM: Don't forget, also coming up

3085
02:02:32.753 --> 02:02:34.114
in the second half of the show,

3086
02:02:34.114 --> 02:02:35.888
part two of the D&amp;D Beyond ad,

3087
02:02:35.888 --> 02:02:40.512
which is about 25 minutes of interpretive dance.

3088
02:02:40.512 --> 02:02:42.583
LIAM: It's based on Aeschylus.

3089
02:02:42.583 --> 02:02:45.160
(laughter)

3090
02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:46.680
MATT: So look forward to that.

3091
02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:48.537

02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:40.705
ASHLEY: Sometimes looking back, I'm like, oh

3113
02:03:40.705 --> 02:03:42.791
that was not a normal upbringing.

3114
02:03:42.791 --> 02:03:44.339
But it was fun, you know.

3115
02:03:44.339 --> 02:03:48.251
My parents-- we had, we had a party house.

3116
02:03:48.251 --> 02:03:50.187
BRIAN: Yeah, everybody tells stories about you kids

3117
02:03:50.187 --> 02:03:52.379
going to bed and going, can you guys keep it down?

3118
02:03:52.379 --> 02:03:55.389
ASHLEY: Yeah, my parents would stay up,

3119
02:03:55.389 --> 02:03:56.579
I mean my mom still.

3120
02:03:56.579 --> 02:03:57.611
BRIAN: You're mom still stays up and watches?

3121
02:03:57.611 --> 02:04:00.203
ASHLEY: She stays up until three o'clock in the morning

3122
02:04:00.203 --> 02:04:02.563
and we had people over all the time

3123
02:04:02.563 --> 02:04:04.869
and we would play music,

3124
02:04:04.869 --> 02:04:07.591
and watch movies and it was,

3125
02:04:07.591 --> 02:04:10.115
it was a really fun house.

3126
02:04:10.115 --> 02:04:13.365
And when I look back on my upbringing

3127
02:04:13.365 --> 02:04:16.984
I'm not thinking about the projects that I did,

3128
02:04:16.984 --> 02:04:19.372
like it's not measured by, oh that's when I was

3129
02:04:19.372 --> 02:04:21.724
working on this, or that's when I was working on this.

3130
02:04:21.724 --> 02:04:24.440
It's more about the life experiences that I had

3131
02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.060
and I think that's a positive thing.

3132
02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:27.380
BRIAN: Those are the milestones you remember.

3133
02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:28.225

Today, we're playing Overcooked.

LIAM: (screaming)

BRIAN: It's our little critter friend, Tet'Nus Terry.

3159
02:05:45.169 --> 02:05:46.716
TRAVIS: He's hanging on with with one hand.

3160
02:05:46.716 --> 02:05:48.724
LIAM: Oh boy howdy,

3161
02:05:48.724 --> 02:05:51.096
I've never been happy to see your

3162
02:05:51.096 --> 02:05:53.929
chiseled, handsome face, Chosen One.

3163
02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:59.152
And your dried up cow shit excuse for a mug too, chestnut.

3164
02:05:59.152 --> 02:06:00.916
TRAVIS: Oh no.

3165
02:06:00.916 --> 02:06:01.749
I can't.

3166
02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:04.852
LIAM: Fuck balls, I think one of Bast'Alar's

3167
02:06:04.852 --> 02:06:09.412
Down Lords triggered a realm shift.

3168
02:06:09.412 --> 02:06:12.216
BRIAN: What the fuck is a Down Lord?

3169
02:06:12.216 --> 02:06:16.616
LIAM: Down Lords is Bast'Alar's human pets.

3170

3171

LIAM: Well, I'm glad you find this so amusing.

3172
02:06:20.855 --> 02:06:22.776
We got warlock henchman out here

3173
02:06:22.776 --> 02:06:25.187
doing Bast'Alar's bidding.

3174
02:06:25.187 --> 02:06:26.976
BRIAN: What the fuck is a realm shift?

3175
02:06:26.976 --> 02:06:28.640
Or realm shift.

3176
02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:31.788
LIAM: You don't know shit from a tea kettle, do you?

3177
02:06:31.788 --> 02:06:33.576
BRIAN: Not really, I guess. I don't know.

3178
02:06:33.576 --> 02:06:35.916
LIAM: You even know how to wipe your own ass, boy,

3179
02:06:35.916 --> 02:06:38.322
or you need me to do that for you, too?

3180
02:06:38.322 --> 02:06:40.017
TRAVIS: Oh shit, tell him, Terry.

3181
02:06:40.017 --> 02:06:43.440
LIAM: A realm shift is a black magic spell

3182
02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:47.460
that alters the fabric of the gameverse time land.

3183
02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:49.140
BRIAN: None of that sounds good at all,

3184
02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.968
so what should we do?

3185
02:06:50.968 --> 02:06:54.009
LIAM: Let's check the soul battery and see where we're at.

3186
02:06:54.009 --> 02:06:58.968
(wacky electronic machine sounds)

3187
02:06:58.968 --> 02:06:59.809
TRAVIS: Where'd he go?

3188
02:06:59.809 --> 02:07:01.376
(wacky electronic machine sounds)

3189
02:07:01.376 --> 02:07:02.502
(cow moo)

3190
02:07:02.502 --> 02:07:07.184
LIAM: Ooh hoo hoo! You boys <i>have</i> been turning the wheel.

3191
02:07:07.184 --> 02:07:09.367
Yee-haw!

3192
02:07:10.768 --> 02:07:12.956
Once you boys charge this up all the way,

3193
02:07:12.956 --> 02:07:15.836
we can move on to the next realm.

3194
02:07:15.836 --> 02:07:17.153
BRIAN: How many realms are there?

3195
02:07:17.153 --> 02:07:19.384
How do we travel to them, realms?

3196
02:07:19.384 --> 02:07:22.016
(horn blaring)

3197
02:07:22.016 --> 02:07:24.296
LIAM: Holy shit, can't talk now, boys.

3198
02:07:24.296 --> 02:07:26.396
This baby's about to pop!

3199
02:07:26.396 --> 02:07:30.416
I'll take care of this. You boys keep playing those games.

3200
02:07:30.416 --> 02:07:32.333
Our lives depend on it!

3201
02:07:33.476 --> 02:07:35.112
BRIAN: Watch me get us out of this.

3202
02:07:35.112 --> 02:07:38.204
TRAVIS: Wait, I was out first, I ran like x.

3203
02:07:38.204 --> 02:07:39.524
I saved the day.

3204
02:07:39.524 --> 02:07:40.566
Fuck!

3205
02:07:40.566 --> 02:07:41.399
BRIAN: Travis.

3206
02:07:41.399 --> 02:07:43.168
TRAVIS: I didn't, I didn't touch anything.

3207
02:07:43.168 --> 02:07:44.529
Resume.

3208
02:07:44.529 --> 02:07:46.196
BRIAN: I don't like this one bit, dude.

3209
02:07:46.196 --> 02:07:47.029
TRAVIS: But wait.

3210
02:07:47.029 --> 02:07:50.069
BRIAN: You went this way and pressed X.

3211
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:51.645
Jerry, what the fuck?

3212
02:07:51.645 --> 02:07:52.478
JERRY: Down.

3213
02:07:52.478 --> 02:07:53.757
BRIAN: Down this way?

3214
02:07:53.757 --> 02:07:54.590
JERRY: Press X.

3215
02:07:54.590 --> 02:07:55.609
BRIAN: We did.

3216
02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:57.972
TRAVIS: Yeah, look it goes-- oh.

3217
02:07:57.972 --> 02:07:59.685
BRIAN: You need tomatoes. I see them on the board.

3218
02:07:59.685 --> 02:08:01.049
I'm putting tomatoes up here.

3219
02:08:01.049 --> 02:08:03.897
I don't want to hear about how far away they are.

3220
02:08:03.897 --> 02:08:04.730
TRAVIS: Why is everything moving?

3221
02:08:04.730 --> 02:08:05.877
Why is everything moving?

3222
02:08:05.877 --> 02:08:06.945
Why is everything moving?

3223
02:08:06.945 --> 02:08:07.916
BRIAN: I did not.

3224
02:08:07.916 --> 02:08:09.765
Oh hey look, it's me.

3225
02:08:09.765 --> 02:08:10.977
No, it's burning!

3226
02:08:10.977 --> 02:08:12.477
TRAVIS: Get around to the other side, boost!

3227
02:08:12.477 --> 02:08:13.880
Boost!

3228
02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:15.546
(screaming)

3229
02:08:15.546 --> 02:08:16.379
I need the fire extinguisher.

3230
02:08:16.379 --> 02:08:18.804
BRIAN: I can't get it. I'm going around.

3231
02:08:20.037 --> 02:08:22.133
TRAVIS: Everything's on fire!

3232
02:08:22.133 --> 02:08:23.437
It's on fire!

3233
02:08:23.437 --> 02:08:26.300
BRIAN: Oh I have to chop it, fuck! I hate this game.

3234
02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:27.215
TRAVIS: Oh God.

3235
02:08:27.215 --> 02:08:28.310
BRIAN: I love cooking, but I hate this game.

3236
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:30.227
No, I got it, I got it.

3237
02:08:31.145 --> 02:08:33.349
TRAVIS: Put on the right, put it all the way to the right!

3238
02:08:33.349 --> 02:08:35.682
(screaming)

3239
02:08:37.161 --> 02:08:39.663
BRIAN: Dude, dude, set it the fuck-- okay.

3240
02:08:39.663 --> 02:08:40.505
Take it to the people.

3241
02:08:40.505 --> 02:08:43.789
Take it to the people, thank you.

3242
02:08:43.789 --> 02:08:47.017
Dude, don't put meat over here that's all deep red.

3243
02:08:47.017 --> 02:08:47.945
TRAVIS: Have some vegetables.

3244
02:08:47.945 --> 02:08:49.477
BRIAN: I'm working on it, dude.

3245
02:08:49.477 --> 02:08:50.377
I don't know what even--

3246
02:08:50.377 --> 02:08:52.237
you're not calling out what you need.

3247
02:08:52.237 --> 02:08:53.321
TRAVIS: We're here.

3248
02:08:53.321 --> 02:08:54.577
BRIAN: All right.

3249
02:08:54.577 --> 02:08:55.877
TRAVIS: I got-- (wheezing)

3250
02:08:56.900 --> 02:08:58.281
BRIAN: Three, two, one for what?

3251
02:08:58.281 --> 02:09:00.069
Dude, there's a rat.

3252
02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:01.629
TRAVIS: What the fuck!?

3253
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:02.933
BRIAN: There's a fucking Ratatouille, bro.

3254
02:09:02.933 --> 02:09:04.297
TRAVIS: Don't you take the god damn food, you piece of shit!

3255
02:09:04.297 --> 02:09:05.390
BRIAN: He is taking the food.

3256
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:06.817
Can we cut the rat?

3257
02:09:06.817 --> 02:09:07.853
You're going with a bigger guy?

3258
02:09:07.853 --> 02:09:08.686
TRAVIS: Yep.

3259
02:09:08.686 --> 02:09:09.969
BRIAN: Where'd you find him?
TRAVIS: Shut up.

3260
02:09:09.969 --> 02:09:11.302
One, two, three.

3261
02:09:12.432 --> 02:09:15.296
(exclaiming)

3262
02:09:15.296 --> 02:09:19.016
BRIAN: At last. (imitating guitar sounds)

3263
02:09:19.016 --> 02:09:20.473
TRAVIS: What is this?

3264
02:09:20.473 --> 02:09:22.661
BRIAN (VO): Last time on Talks Machina.

3265
02:09:22.661 --> 02:09:25.017
BRIAN: Can you describe for us in detail,

3266
02:09:25.017 --> 02:09:26.997
just exactly how much fun it was

3267
02:09:26.997 --> 02:09:29.261
to not only DM for Stephen Colbert,

3268
02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:31.677
but to watch his joyful grin reflected back at you

3269
02:09:31.677 --> 02:09:33.881
as you shared in his one shot for Red Nose Day?

3270
02:09:33.881 --> 02:09:36.742
You both looked so happy.

3271
02:09:36.742 --> 02:09:39.101
MATT: That was, well played.

3272
02:09:39.101 --> 02:09:41.473
That was absolutely surreal.

3273
02:09:41.473 --> 02:09:44.301
I'm still processing it. It was crazy.

3274
02:09:44.301 --> 02:09:47.353
We all know how long I've been joking about this

3275
02:09:47.353 --> 02:09:51.177
and talking about it as this not possible pipe dream.

3276
02:09:51.177 --> 02:09:52.345
TALIESIN: It's like since like week one

3277
02:09:52.345 --> 02:09:54.837
of discussing putting the show possibly on the internet

3278
02:09:54.837 --> 02:09:55.993
it seems like a joke.

3279
02:09:55.993 --> 02:09:57.117
MATT: And jokingly at home like

3280
02:09:57.117 --> 02:09:58.301
when you have those conversations,

3281
02:09:58.301 --> 02:09:59.918
be like, man, I bet you'd be fun to play with.

3282
02:09:59.918 --> 02:10:01.993
There was an element to me wanting to make sure

3283
02:10:01.993 --> 02:10:03.205
that it was a good experience and hoping

3284
02:10:03.205 --> 02:10:04.257
that it would be a good experience

3285
02:10:04.257 --> 02:10:07.807
and he was more cordial and warm

3286
02:10:07.807 --> 02:10:09.985
and genuine than I could have ever hoped.

3287
02:10:09.985 --> 02:10:11.365
BRIAN: You made his fucking day, dude.

3288
02:10:11.365 --> 02:10:13.361
MATT: He made my fucking day! It was amazing

3289
02:10:13.361 --> 02:10:15.433
and like, I was so nervous. I don't know if you can tell.

3290
02:10:15.433 --> 02:10:16.917
I'm super nervous the whole way,

3291
02:10:16.917 --> 02:10:18.657
definitely in the beginning.

3292
02:10:18.657 --> 02:10:19.735
But as soon as we began to open up

3293
02:10:19.735 --> 02:10:21.325
and talk about his history and get into the

3294
02:10:21.325 --> 02:10:23.577
into the swing of it and,

3295
02:10:23.577 --> 02:10:26.125
you know, finding those old muscles and flex them again,

3296
02:10:26.125 --> 02:10:28.165
then it just got this comfortable like back and forth

3297
02:10:28.165 --> 02:10:30.193
and seeing him have fun, I had fun.

3298
02:10:30.193 --> 02:10:31.165
We kept smiling back and forth,

3299
02:10:31.165 --> 02:10:33.721
and the play was great and,

3300
02:10:33.721 --> 02:10:36.457
in the moment, I couldn't really enjoy it fully

3301
02:10:36.457 --> 02:10:38.225
because I was wanting to just make it

3302
02:10:38.225 --> 02:10:40.432
as fun for him as possible.

3303
02:10:40.432 --> 02:10:43.073
And it wasn't until the following day

3304
02:10:43.073 --> 02:10:44.825
where I got to see the first real cut of it

3305
02:10:44.825 --> 02:10:46.865
that I began giggling like a

3306
02:10:46.865 --> 02:10:50.279
like a child in my living room and I'm--

3307
02:10:50.279 --> 02:10:52.445
just thank you guys for making this possible.

3308
02:10:52.445 --> 02:10:54.146
It was absolutely surreal.
BRIAN: So cool.

3309
02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:55.579
BRIAN: Do you know what's the fucking

3310
02:10:55.579 --> 02:10:56.837
chillest shit in the world?

3311
02:10:57.784 --> 02:11:00.018
Cosplay of the Week.

3312
02:11:00.896 --> 02:11:03.361
Stevie saw. Stevie blew it.

3313
02:11:03.361 --> 02:11:04.289
MATT: Good segue, yeah!

3314
02:11:04.289 --> 02:11:07.033
TALIESIN: Man, what a segue.

3315
02:11:07.033 --> 02:11:10.185
DANI: Cosplay of the Week, looking fine!

3316
02:11:10.185 --> 02:11:12.201
BRIAN: Our winner for this week

3317
02:11:12.201 --> 02:11:15.535
was sent in by Alec McLeod at

3318
02:11:17.292 --> 02:11:20.814
graviteacosplay? Graviteacosplay.

3319
02:11:20.814 --> 02:11:21.657
It's going to be on the screen.

3320
02:11:21.657 --> 02:11:24.023
Photo by @HopeInAshes. Let's take a look.

3321
02:11:24.023 --> 02:11:25.497
This one's good.

3322
02:11:25.497 --> 02:11:27.357
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Ah, I love that!

3323
02:11:27.357 --> 02:11:28.190
DANI: So good.

3324
02:11:28.190 --> 02:11:31.013
TALIESIN: So good.
BRIAN: Wow, that's awesome.

3325
02:11:31.013 --> 02:11:33.069
MATT: Perspective too.

3326
02:11:33.069 --> 02:11:35.225
We need some Barry White in the background.

3327
02:11:35.225 --> 02:11:36.432
Just imagine that, right?

3328
02:11:36.432 --> 02:11:39.148
DANI: (singing a Barry White-esque tune)

3329
02:11:39.148 --> 02:11:39.981
(giggles)

3330
02:11:42.984 --> 02:11:44.785
DANI: Yeah.

3331
02:11:44.785 --> 02:11:46.861
BRIAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3332
02:11:46.861 --> 02:11:47.694
Whoa.

3333
02:11:48.745 --> 02:11:49.578
DANI: See!

3334
02:11:49.578 --> 02:11:51.935
BRIAN: That went places I was not expecting.

3335
02:11:51.935 --> 02:11:53.510
DANI: Beautiful.

3336
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:56.315
BRIAN: Dani, thank you for suggesting a second pass.

3337
02:11:56.315 --> 02:11:57.755
That had an arc to it.

3338
02:11:57.755 --> 02:12:00.722
TALIESIN: So were you surprised that we got the Dodeca?

3339
02:12:00.722 --> 02:12:03.603
Was that something-- did you have a plan for that?

3340
02:12:03.603 --> 02:12:04.955
MATT: That you got it, you mean?

3341
02:12:04.955 --> 02:12:06.919
TALIESIN: That we managed to obtain, yeah, the Dodeca.

3342
02:12:06.919 --> 02:12:08.103
MATT: I knew it was a possibility.

3343
02:12:08.103 --> 02:12:09.111
TALIESIN: Okay, that's what I was thinking.

3344
02:12:09.111 --> 02:12:10.681
MATT: Which is why you guys lost it,

3345
02:12:10.681 --> 02:12:12.275
like it was a thing where it was,

3346
02:12:12.275 --> 02:12:14.239
you know depending on if you just stayed out of this

3347
02:12:14.239 --> 02:12:16.201
and ran, it wouldn't have happened,

3348
02:12:16.201 --> 02:12:18.155
but if you had enough curiosity,

3349
02:12:18.155 --> 02:12:19.713
which I knew as players you might,

3350
02:12:19.713 --> 02:12:21.635
you'd probably try and find out what's going on

3351
02:12:21.635 --> 02:12:23.119
and you know, went to the sewers,

3352
02:12:23.119 --> 02:12:25.759
and where you intersected with this Kryn soldier

3353
02:12:25.759 --> 02:12:28.803
and then there was a conflict with them,

3354
02:12:28.803 --> 02:12:30.423
which you could have killed them and taken it.

3355
02:12:30.423 --> 02:12:32.031
You kept him alive and let him leave with it.

3356
02:12:32.031 --> 02:12:34.023
I was like, all right, well it's gone.

3357
02:12:34.023 --> 02:12:35.974
But then you decided to, you know,

3358
02:12:35.974 --> 02:12:37.895
I was showing you-- well, it's

3359
02:12:37.895 --> 02:12:40.131
showing you the consequences of what you did

3360
02:12:40.131 --> 02:12:43.371
and now you see the Crownsguard taking it.

3361
02:12:43.371 --> 02:12:45.079
So there you go, you fucked up.

3362
02:12:45.079 --> 02:12:46.496
Now they have it.

3363
02:12:48.099 --> 02:12:49.160
Can't really say fucked up, but eventually

3364
02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:50.291
they would have returned to it.

3365
02:12:50.291 --> 02:12:52.315
BRIAN: I mean I was laughing just because

3366
02:12:52.315 --> 02:12:54.707
of how cute it was.

3367
02:12:54.707 --> 02:12:56.018
MATT:But then you guys are like, all right,

3368
02:12:56.018 --> 02:12:57.219
we're going to hatch a plan to try and get it back

3369
02:12:57.219 --> 02:12:58.539
and I'm like, all right, let's see how this works out.

3370
02:12:58.539 --> 02:13:01.791
And you did, so. I try and create things

3371
02:13:01.791 --> 02:13:05.463
where I have ideas on what you might do

3372
02:13:05.463 --> 02:13:06.635
and sometimes you do it.

3373
02:13:06.635 --> 02:13:08.777
Sometimes you completely subvert my expectations.

3374
02:13:08.777 --> 02:13:10.383
TALIESIN: I feel like we haven't screamed pub crawl in

3375
02:13:10.383 --> 02:13:12.499
a while, which is probably for the-- you know at some point.

3376
02:13:12.499 --> 02:13:13.847
Yeah, at some point, that'll happen again.

3377
02:13:13.847 --> 02:13:15.683
BRIAN: Fan art of the week.

3378
02:13:15.683 --> 02:13:19.414
DANI: Yeah, fan art of the week!

3379
02:13:19.414 --> 02:13:21.953
Woo! Love you, art dad!

3380
02:13:21.953 --> 02:13:23.657
BRIAN: This week's fan art winner for campaign two,

3381
02:13:23.657 --> 02:13:26.103
episode 64 was sent in by Sunset Dragon

3382
02:13:26.103 --> 02:13:28.567
@_sunsetdragon_, let's take a look.

3383
02:13:28.567 --> 02:13:31.191
This is cute. This so you guys.

3384
02:13:31.191 --> 02:13:33.629
MATT: Oh, I didn't see this!

3385
02:13:33.629 --> 02:13:36.046
TALIESIN: That's adorable.

3386
02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:41.411
Oh, there's lollipops and donuts in the wings.

3387
02:13:41.411 --> 02:13:43.059
I love it.

3388
02:13:43.059 --> 02:13:44.246
DANI: It's so cute.

3389
02:13:44.246 --> 02:13:47.411
BRIAN: Episode 65 is this week. Can you believe it?

3390
02:13:47.411 --> 02:13:48.244
MATT: It's going to be cool.

3391
02:13:48.244 --> 02:13:49.227
TALIESIN: It's going to be cool, man.

3392
02:13:49.227 --> 02:13:50.577
BRIAN: We are so close.

3393
02:13:50.577 --> 02:13:51.410
OFFSCREEN: Four more.

3394
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:52.827
TALIESIN: Just four more and then what happens

3395
02:13:52.827 --> 02:13:53.999
after four more?

3396
02:13:53.999 --> 02:13:56.574
DANI: I'm so excited. I don't even think we can do

3397
02:13:56.574 --> 02:13:57.743
Talks after that one.

3398
02:13:57.743 --> 02:13:59.215
TALIESIN: What happens in four episodes?

3399
02:13:59.215 --> 02:14:00.355
MATT: I don't know what happens.

3400
02:14:00.355 --> 02:14:01.188
TALIESIN: Then we get to rest.

3401
02:14:01.188 --> 02:14:04.580
BRIAN: 69 episodes of Critical Role campaign two.

3402
02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:05.924
MATT: Oh.
TALIESIN: Oh.

3403
02:14:05.924 --> 02:14:06.757
MATT: Nice.
TALIESIN: Nice.

3404
02:14:06.757 --> 02:14:07.926
DANI: I feel like, I feel like--

3405
02:14:07.926 --> 02:14:12.617
(laughing)

3406
02:14:12.617 --> 02:14:15.252
(laughing)

3407
02:14:15.252 --> 02:14:16.518
TALIESIN: Oh god.

3408
02:14:17.535 --> 02:14:22.426
(dramatic music)

3409
02:27:30.616 --> 02:27:33.976
MATT: And welcome back, slow on the draw, Liam O'Brien.

3410
02:27:33.976 --> 02:27:37.116
LIAM: Yeah, totally was on purpose.

3411
02:27:37.116 --> 02:27:38.782
MATT: So before we get into the game,

3412
02:27:38.782 --> 02:27:40.232
we have our winner for the next giveaway.

3413
02:27:40.232 --> 02:27:42.424
The winner is Lihnali.

3414
02:27:42.424 --> 02:27:45.768
L-I-H-N-A-L-I, Lihnali, congratulations.

3415
02:27:45.768 --> 02:27:50.568
We'll go ahead and get your Wyrmwood dice box to you ASAP.

3416
02:27:50.568 --> 02:27:52.666
SAM: Also, Matt before we start

3417
02:27:52.666 --> 02:27:55.261
the second half of the show.

3418
02:27:55.261 --> 02:27:57.260
In honor of Liam and Laura's birthday,

3419
02:27:57.260 --> 02:27:59.505
I brought you all presents.

3420
02:27:59.505 --> 02:28:01.608
Certainly not something that we want to use

3421
02:28:01.608 --> 02:28:03.771
during the show tonight, but I brought everybody

3422
02:28:03.771 --> 02:28:07.312
a can of silly string just to have.

3423
02:28:07.312 --> 02:28:08.395
Just to have.

3424
02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:10.747
Even you, Matt.

3425
02:28:14.045 --> 02:28:17.200
I can't get it to you.
TALIESIN: Come closer.

3426
02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:18.783
SAM: Just in case.

3427
02:28:19.838 --> 02:28:21.804
We should not use this tonight though.

3428
02:28:21.804 --> 02:28:24.952
MATT: You are such an agent of chaos.

3429
02:28:24.952 --> 02:28:28.789
MARISHA: This shit is like the worst to clean up.

3430
02:28:28.789 --> 02:28:31.158
SAM: Oh, that's a bottle of tea.

3431
02:28:31.158 --> 02:28:33.325
ASHLEY: I'm going to prepare it.

3432
02:28:34.596 --> 02:28:35.839
LAURA: We won't use it though.

3433
02:28:35.839 --> 02:28:39.563
SAM: But it's to honor Liam and Laura.

3434
02:28:39.563 --> 02:28:44.090
MARISHA: Max just scowled from around the curtain.

3435
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:45.640
LIAM: We didn't see it, we felt it.

3436
02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:46.473
MARISHA: Yeah.

3437
02:28:46.473 --> 02:28:48.339
LIAM: On our backs.

3438
02:28:48.339 --> 02:28:52.438
ASHLEY: Should we put money on who uses it first? Travis.

3439
02:28:52.438 --> 02:28:54.538
TRAVIS: That is so unfair.

3440
02:28:54.538 --> 02:28:56.502
MATT: Whoever uses it first loses a death saving throw.

3441
02:28:56.502 --> 02:28:58.062
MARISHA: Don't get in the panels.

3442
02:28:58.062 --> 02:28:59.174
TRAVIS: And smart money.

3443
02:28:59.174 --> 02:29:01.558
MARISHA: Or in the cams or in the rafters,

3444
02:29:01.558 --> 02:29:02.638
or in the grid.

3445
02:29:02.638 --> 02:29:03.762
LIAM: Ceiling.

3446
02:29:03.762 --> 02:29:07.262
TALIESIN: I remember when you were fun.

3447
02:29:08.771 --> 02:29:12.271
MARISHA: This what responsibility has done to me.

3448
02:29:13.290 --> 02:29:14.818
MATT: Nott.

3449
02:29:14.818 --> 02:29:16.230
SAM: Oh, but that's right, I'm invisible.

3450
02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:17.391
MATT: Yes, you are.

3451
02:29:17.391 --> 02:29:18.742
SAM: Oh shit.

3452
02:29:18.742 --> 02:29:21.878
MATT: You approach slowly, quietly.

3453
02:29:21.878 --> 02:29:26.530
Roll a stealth check for me please with advantage.

3454
02:29:26.530 --> 02:29:28.642
SAM: I can take that one, 26.

3455
02:29:28.642 --> 02:29:29.559
MATT: 26, okay.

3456
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:36.818
LIAM: Just over here jerking it, it's fine.

3457
02:29:36.818 --> 02:29:38.438
MATT: Yeah, that's cool.

3458
02:29:38.438 --> 02:29:41.138
This is going to be so gif-able.

3459
02:29:41.138 --> 02:29:42.698
SAM: That's how it sounds.

3460
02:29:42.698 --> 02:29:44.955
(laughter)

3461
02:29:44.955 --> 02:29:45.903
SAM: Ah!

3462
02:29:45.903 --> 02:29:48.923
MATT: Yeah, with the right piercing, I guess.

3463
02:29:48.923 --> 02:29:49.756
Anyway.

3464
02:29:51.674 --> 02:29:54.674
The first to fire loses a character.

3465
02:29:57.914 --> 02:30:00.854
As you quietly approach the base of this tree,

3466
02:30:00.854 --> 02:30:04.886
you look out at the peripheral of your darkvision.

3467
02:30:04.886 --> 02:30:06.882
You begin to see these massive roots

3468
02:30:06.882 --> 02:30:08.714
that are dug and intertwined

3469
02:30:08.714 --> 02:30:13.638
within the broken, red clay earth around it.

3470
02:30:15.161 --> 02:30:19.858
But where the roots break in, you can see

3471
02:30:19.858 --> 02:30:21.483
grass:

3472
02:30:21.483 --> 02:30:25.931
green, unnaturally healthy.

3473
02:30:25.931 --> 02:30:29.534
Seems to exist in a proximity about five or ten feet

3474
02:30:29.534 --> 02:30:31.466
around the base of these roots.

3475
02:30:31.466 --> 02:30:35.844
The roots curl and pile over each other

3476
02:30:35.844 --> 02:30:39.582
and knot and eventually pull up towards this

3477
02:30:39.582 --> 02:30:43.323
massive, looming natural structure.

3478
02:30:45.443 --> 02:30:47.199
SAM: Any people moving or creatures?

3479
02:30:47.199 --> 02:30:49.826
MATT: Make a perception check.

3480
02:30:49.826 --> 02:30:51.117
SAM: Hey, 15.

3481
02:30:51.117 --> 02:30:54.359
MTT: You glance up and

3482
02:30:55.462 --> 02:30:58.646
immediately you see

3483
02:30:58.646 --> 02:31:03.102
a dozen or so tiny creatures that

3484
02:31:03.102 --> 02:31:05.126
are climbing up the sides of tree

3485
02:31:05.126 --> 02:31:08.126
maybe about a foot across.

3486
02:31:08.126 --> 02:31:11.376
Just clung to the side of it.

3487
02:31:12.478 --> 02:31:15.686
SAM: Is there a hollowed out center,

3488
02:31:15.686 --> 02:31:18.102
is there a way to get into the tree

3489
02:31:18.102 --> 02:31:20.190
through the tree?

3490
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:21.462
Or is it just a tree?

3491
02:31:21.462 --> 02:31:22.598
MATT: From where you're standing right now,

3492
02:31:22.598 --> 02:31:26.499
it looks like it's a pretty solid mass of tree.

3493
02:31:26.499 --> 02:31:28.946
SAM: How about, I'm going to go over to the grass

3494
02:31:28.946 --> 02:31:31.258
and inspect around some of the roots

3495
02:31:31.258 --> 02:31:33.611
to see if there's some holes

3496
02:31:33.611 --> 02:31:35.158
that burrow down under.

3497
02:31:35.158 --> 02:31:37.658
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3498
02:31:40.542 --> 02:31:41.502
SAM: 17.

3499
02:31:41.502 --> 02:31:46.078
MATT: Taking some time looking and peeking through,

3500
02:31:46.078 --> 02:31:48.930
most of it seems pretty solid and clutched.

3501
02:31:48.930 --> 02:31:51.778
You get a little ways around the eastern,

3502
02:31:51.778 --> 02:31:54.810
the southeastern side of it and you can see

3503
02:31:54.810 --> 02:31:57.478
a portion of the roots fold inward

3504
02:31:57.478 --> 02:31:59.895
to a small alcove, maybe about

3505
02:32:00.733 --> 02:32:03.116
five feet on one side and ten on the other.

3506
02:32:03.116 --> 02:32:05.382
Just a little inlet to the

3507
02:32:05.382 --> 02:32:07.590
tree's roots, but there's no

3508
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:11.141
knothole that you can climb into or anything.

3509
02:32:11.141 --> 02:32:13.514
SAM: So that's like an indentation or

3510
02:32:13.514 --> 02:32:16.314
a hole down under the ground?

3511
02:32:16.314 --> 02:32:19.302
MATT: It's a portion where the roots

3512
02:32:19.302 --> 02:32:21.896
leave an opening like a shallow cave

3513
02:32:21.896 --> 02:32:24.269
on the inside of it, but that's the extent

3514
02:32:24.269 --> 02:32:26.019
of what you can find.

3515
02:32:27.147 --> 02:32:28.722
SAM: I'll go over and just look in there.

3516
02:32:28.722 --> 02:32:30.254
MATT: Okay.

3517
02:32:30.254 --> 02:32:32.518
You glance and look inside.

3518
02:32:32.518 --> 02:32:35.862
There is a cluster of stone set there

3519
02:32:35.862 --> 02:32:39.553
in a fire circle,

3520
02:32:39.553 --> 02:32:42.928
but it's been long burned out.

3521
02:32:44.434 --> 02:32:46.942
SAM: Has it been ten minutes yet?

3522
02:32:46.942 --> 02:32:48.516
MATT: I'd say at this point it'd be about ten minutes, yeah.

3523
02:32:48.516 --> 02:32:50.674
SAM: I'll head back stealthily.

3524
02:32:50.674 --> 02:32:53.034
MATT: Okay, you complete your spell,

3525
02:32:53.034 --> 02:32:56.346
the dome apparates around you.

3526
02:32:56.346 --> 02:32:58.898
Still opaque and what color?

3527
02:32:58.898 --> 02:33:01.178
LIAM: Where did we stop,

3528
02:33:01.178 --> 02:33:02.526
100 feet away from the tree?

3529
02:33:02.526 --> 02:33:03.359
MATT: Approximately.

3530
02:33:03.359 --> 02:33:05.738
LIAM: So the same color as the earth beneath it.

3531
02:33:05.738 --> 02:33:08.496
MATT: Okay, like a, like a ruddy brown red color.

3532
02:33:08.496 --> 02:33:09.879
[plastic cap landing on floor]

3533
02:33:09.879 --> 02:33:11.212
LIAM: Yes, that.

3534
02:33:12.562 --> 02:33:15.306
MATT: Okay. The rest of you, are you doing anything

3535
02:33:15.306 --> 02:33:18.572
now that the hut has apparated?

3536
02:33:22.418 --> 02:33:23.902
TALIESIN: Keeping a general lookout.

3537
02:33:23.902 --> 02:33:27.922
How are far away are we from the tree at this point?

3538
02:33:27.922 --> 02:33:29.922
MATT: You're about 100 feet.

3539
02:33:31.237 --> 02:33:34.178
MARISHA: Yeah, no sign of people or scouts?

3540
02:33:34.178 --> 02:33:35.974
No gloomstalkers or scouts, nothing?

3541
02:33:35.974 --> 02:33:37.254
LIAM and MARISHA: In the dark and in the rain.

3542
02:33:37.254 --> 02:33:38.087
MATT: It's dark and in the rain,

3543
02:33:38.087 --> 02:33:41.420
it's hard to see much beyond about

3544
02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:44.540
60 or so feet detail-wise.

3545
02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:46.340
You can make out the tree and where it is

3546
02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:48.456
especially with the flashes of lighting

3547
02:33:48.456 --> 02:33:49.623
far off getting a little bit of a

3548
02:33:49.623 --> 02:33:51.614
a framing to it.

3549
02:33:52.622 --> 02:33:57.184
TRAVIS: I just get inside the dome and hunker down.

3550
02:33:57.184 --> 02:34:01.040
MARISHA: It's nice because the rain's like hitting the top.

3551
02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:03.290
TRAVIS: Like being in a car wash.

3552
02:34:04.758 --> 02:34:05.591
MATT: Okay.

3553
02:34:08.268 --> 02:34:09.101
TALIESIN: I'll take first watch,

3554
02:34:09.101 --> 02:34:12.320
but I'm going to run Commune, I think, before I go to sleep.

3555
02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:13.697
MATT: Okay.

3556
02:34:13.697 --> 02:34:15.293
SAM: I come back and report.

3557
02:34:15.293 --> 02:34:16.126
MATT: Okay.

3558
02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:18.587
TRAVIS: So you lived?

3559
02:34:18.587 --> 02:34:21.226
SAM: I'm here, there was little creatures

3560
02:34:21.226 --> 02:34:23.628
like squirrely sort of things in the tree

3561
02:34:23.628 --> 02:34:26.312
and then roots and then there's this one little cave

3562
02:34:26.312 --> 02:34:29.562
sort of space that someone has been in.

3563
02:34:30.604 --> 02:34:34.112
But I didn't venture in too much.

3564
02:34:34.112 --> 02:34:35.468
Should I go back?

3565
02:34:35.468 --> 02:34:36.301
TRAVIS: Yes.

3566
02:34:36.301 --> 02:34:38.860
SAM: Yes?
TRAVIS: Yep.

3567
02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:40.568
LIAM: Why don't we wait for morning?

3568
02:34:40.568 --> 02:34:41.560
MARISHA: You trying to use reverse psychology?

3569
02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:44.528
LAURA: I'm going to put, in the middle of the room,

3570
02:34:44.528 --> 02:34:49.470
the rod that we found in

3571
02:34:49.470 --> 02:34:54.277
the magic ball in that little alcove, right?

3572
02:34:54.277 --> 02:34:57.518
That was for warming, it was like a little warming rod.

3573
02:34:57.518 --> 02:34:58.388
MATT: Right, yes.

3574
02:34:58.388 --> 02:34:59.380
LAURA: I'm going to put that in the middle

3575
02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:00.804
just so it keeps it a little warmer.

3576
02:35:00.804 --> 02:35:02.185
MATT: Just heats up the dome on the inside.

3577
02:35:02.185 --> 02:35:03.813
Like a space heater.

3578
02:35:03.813 --> 02:35:05.085
MARISHA: A space heater.

3579
02:35:05.085 --> 02:35:06.357
TALIESIN: Uranium.

3580
02:35:06.357 --> 02:35:09.548
(laughter)

3581
02:35:09.548 --> 02:35:13.377
MATT: Ah man, not now, we're watching Chernobyl, no.

3582
02:35:14.745 --> 02:35:17.324
All right, as you're setting up the space heater thing,

3583
02:35:17.324 --> 02:35:19.305
you do notice the floor here.

3584
02:35:19.305 --> 02:35:22.182
It is the same brown red,

3585
02:35:22.182 --> 02:35:25.176
but you look amongst it and there is

3586
02:35:25.176 --> 02:35:27.176
like crumpled, dry grass.

3587
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:31.285
Like grass that has died.

3588
02:35:31.285 --> 02:35:32.133
MARISHA: In the dome?

3589
02:35:32.133 --> 02:35:33.997
MATT: In the dome, on the floor, and around you as well.

3590
02:35:33.997 --> 02:35:35.133
As you take in time to

3591
02:35:35.133 --> 02:35:38.093
take in your area around, now that you have it lit

3592
02:35:38.093 --> 02:35:39.713
within the dome, you notice that

3593
02:35:39.713 --> 02:35:42.577
there is just a bed of crumpled, dry grass.

3594
02:35:42.577 --> 02:35:45.530
LIAM: And we're not seeing it like in action dying.

3595
02:35:45.530 --> 02:35:47.573
MATT and LAURA: It's been dead.

3596
02:35:47.573 --> 02:35:48.924
LIAM: It's been dead and it's wet somewhat

3597
02:35:48.924 --> 02:35:49.897
from the rain that has fallen.

3598
02:35:49.897 --> 02:35:50.730
MATT: Correct.

3599
02:35:50.730 --> 02:35:52.121
SAM: Can we see how far it stretches,

3600
02:35:52.121 --> 02:35:54.057
this patch of dead grass?

3601
02:35:54.057 --> 02:35:57.234
MATT: It fills in the floor of the dome you're in.

3602
02:35:57.234 --> 02:35:58.121
SAM: Just the dome?

3603
02:35:58.121 --> 02:35:59.889
MATT: You look back, you look past it

3604
02:35:59.889 --> 02:36:02.109
and it's everywhere in the vicinity.

3605
02:36:02.109 --> 02:36:04.041
LIAM: The dome is lit up on the inside

3606
02:36:04.041 --> 02:36:06.394
so we're seeing it at night for the first time.

3607
02:36:06.394 --> 02:36:08.245
SAM: Dead grass further.
LAURA: Beyond the tree.

3608
02:36:08.245 --> 02:36:09.385
SAM: All right, that's weird.

3609
02:36:09.385 --> 02:36:10.617
LAURA: It's like the tree is sucking up

3610
02:36:10.617 --> 02:36:14.260
everything within the region and using it for itself.

3611
02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:15.461
MARISHA: That's pretty cool.

3612
02:36:15.461 --> 02:36:17.891
TALIESIN: Or it's hanging on and trying to

3613
02:36:17.891 --> 02:36:18.939
beat back whatever this is.

3614
02:36:18.939 --> 02:36:21.073
LAURA: It's a vampire tree.

3615
02:36:21.073 --> 02:36:22.121
MARISHA: Does this look familiar to what

3616
02:36:22.121 --> 02:36:24.553
your garden was going through?

3617
02:36:24.553 --> 02:36:26.201
TALIESIN: I mean, it

3618
02:36:26.201 --> 02:36:29.473
kind of does. I mean, I don't know.

3619
02:36:29.473 --> 02:36:31.093
I have to think.

3620
02:36:31.093 --> 02:36:33.805
SAM: Can you heal some of this grass?

3621
02:36:33.805 --> 02:36:34.933
TALIESIN: It's dead.

3622
02:36:34.933 --> 02:36:36.957
SAM: Well no, I mean, you're like a cleric,

3623
02:36:36.957 --> 02:36:38.426
can't you like make it grow again?

3624
02:36:38.426 --> 02:36:40.753
LAURA: I pet the grass.

3625
02:36:40.753 --> 02:36:43.862
Oh heal, grass, you can do it.

3626
02:36:44.848 --> 02:36:46.305
SAM: That was good.

3627
02:36:46.305 --> 02:36:48.638
TALIESIN: Doesn't work that way, but

3628
02:36:49.993 --> 02:36:51.613
LAURA: I spit on it.

3629
02:36:51.613 --> 02:36:54.449
It just needs a little water.

3630
02:36:54.449 --> 02:36:55.889
MATT: It's already pretty damp from the rain.

3631
02:36:55.889 --> 02:36:57.734
It's now extra damp.

3632
02:36:57.734 --> 02:36:59.136
TRAVIS: Can I scoop into the ground a little bit

3633
02:36:59.136 --> 02:37:01.139
and just see what's underneath the topsoil?

3634
02:37:01.139 --> 02:37:03.086
MATT: Yeah, sure. You can dig into it and you can see

3635
02:37:03.086 --> 02:37:07.245
there are dried roots for the grass

3636
02:37:08.443 --> 02:37:11.967
having set there, but it is damp.

3637
02:37:11.967 --> 02:37:16.967
As you pull up the roots, the roots look healthy.

3638
02:37:16.981 --> 02:37:19.722
SAM and LAURA: Hmm.

3639
02:37:21.672 --> 02:37:23.505
SAM: Recently dead grass?

3640
02:37:24.971 --> 02:37:26.138
TALIESIN: It looks recent.

3641
02:37:29.651 --> 02:37:31.691
LAURA: What's that about?

3642
02:37:31.691 --> 02:37:33.927
TALIESIN: I may sit and take my questions at some point.

3643
02:37:33.927 --> 02:37:37.003
MATT: Okay, so you're going ahead and cast Commune.

3644
02:37:37.003 --> 02:37:40.377
All righty, let me go ahead and bring this up here.

3645
02:37:40.377 --> 02:37:42.100
SAM: Anyone we need to send messages to?

3646
02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:43.919
TALIESIN: Three yes or nos.

3647
02:37:43.919 --> 02:37:46.120
SAM: We still haven't contacted the Bright Queen

3648
02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:47.803
to tell her where we are, what we're doing.

3649
02:37:47.803 --> 02:37:49.542
LAURA: Yeah, but everybody said not to do that.

3650
02:37:49.542 --> 02:37:51.927
SAM: Yeah, but maybe if you ask the same question again

3651
02:37:51.927 --> 02:37:54.760
they'll give you a different answer.

3652
02:37:57.188 --> 02:37:59.307
MATT: So it only takes a minute for you to cast.

3653
02:37:59.307 --> 02:38:00.387
Since we're having this conversation,

3654
02:38:00.387 --> 02:38:04.091
you sit down in the dome, close your eyes, focus,

3655
02:38:04.091 --> 02:38:08.996
and as your consciousness expands

3656
02:38:08.996 --> 02:38:11.411
beyond your physical body,

3657
02:38:11.411 --> 02:38:16.244
you feel the warmth of the land around you.

3658
02:38:17.519 --> 02:38:21.162
The heat of the day, the winds,

3659
02:38:21.162 --> 02:38:24.329
and the cold of the storm all at once.

3660
02:38:25.603 --> 02:38:28.388
Like experiencing the fields and beyond

3661
02:38:28.388 --> 02:38:31.055
and one condensed rapid instant.

3662
02:38:33.011 --> 02:38:36.094
Then you feel the comfortable embrace

3663
02:38:37.151 --> 02:38:39.371
of a familiar presence.

3664
02:38:39.371 --> 02:38:42.471
Warm, encompassing.

3665
02:38:47.832 --> 02:38:49.693
What would you like to ask?

3666
02:38:49.693 --> 02:38:52.096
SAM: It's Avantika.

3667
02:38:52.096 --> 02:38:53.929
TALIESIN: Is this place yours?

3668
02:38:59.879 --> 02:39:02.819
MATT: The images and emotions come to you.

3669
02:39:02.819 --> 02:39:04.347
When you communicate,

3670
02:39:04.347 --> 02:39:06.924
it's less words directly, and it's more

3671
02:39:06.924 --> 02:39:09.959
a series of emotions and images

3672
02:39:09.959 --> 02:39:13.571
that you interpret as words and phrases.

3673
02:39:13.571 --> 02:39:18.571
And it comes to an agreement,

3674
02:39:18.703 --> 02:39:22.003
and acknowledgment to that, "Yes.

3675
02:39:22.003 --> 02:39:25.795
"It is mine, my last and final seed."

3676
02:39:29.999 --> 02:39:31.999
TALIESIN: How new is the threat?

3677
02:39:37.194 --> 02:39:41.260
I suppose I would say: Is this one season?

3678
02:39:41.260 --> 02:39:45.319
What's the thing that's beaten you back?

3679
02:39:48.223 --> 02:39:50.473
MATT: "The land remains scarred.

3680
02:39:51.355 --> 02:39:54.938
"It has since we all stepped away."

3681
02:39:57.687 --> 02:39:59.687
TALIESIN: Am I here to fix this?

3682
02:40:01.963 --> 02:40:03.796
MATT: "It's too big to fix.

3683
02:40:07.063 --> 02:40:08.896
"Your path is your own."

3684
02:40:12.283 --> 02:40:15.447
TALIESIN: I don't like that answer one bit.

3685
02:40:15.447 --> 02:40:16.280
All right.

3686
02:40:21.443 --> 02:40:24.776
I will quietly come out of my

3687
02:40:26.408 --> 02:40:31.151
trance. Yeah, I've got nothing to say to that.

3688
02:40:31.151 --> 02:40:32.394
MATT: Okay.

3689
02:40:32.394 --> 02:40:35.063
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Essek.

3690
02:40:35.063 --> 02:40:36.063
MATT: All right.

3691
02:40:38.559 --> 02:40:41.439
LAURA: Quick question, do you know anything

3692
02:40:41.439 --> 02:40:44.111
about a big tree growing in the Barbed Fields?

3693
02:40:44.111 --> 02:40:46.523
It's really big, have you heard about it?

3694
02:40:46.523 --> 02:40:47.499
What's it do?

3695
02:40:47.499 --> 02:40:48.749
Why is it here?

3696
02:40:51.535 --> 02:40:54.130
MATT: "You have made it to the Arbor Exemplar.

3697
02:40:54.130 --> 02:40:55.713
"That is impressive.

3698
02:40:57.611 --> 02:41:01.028
"It's also very deep in dangerous terrain.

3699
02:41:04.167 --> 02:41:07.886
"You are doing me proud," and that's it.

3700
02:41:07.886 --> 02:41:08.719
LAURA: Ooh!

3701
02:41:10.059 --> 02:41:12.607
Have any of you heard about the Arbor Exemplar?

3702
02:41:12.607 --> 02:41:15.356
SAM: Of course, Caleb probably has in his

3703
02:41:15.356 --> 02:41:17.754
extensive reading, right, Caleb?

3704
02:41:17.754 --> 02:41:19.015
MATT: Unfortunately, through the religion checks

3705
02:41:19.015 --> 02:41:22.207
you guys made previously, none of you have any idea.

3706
02:41:22.207 --> 02:41:24.399
MARISHA: I didn't make one earlier.

3707
02:41:24.399 --> 02:41:26.332
LIAM: But it was for people with proficiency.

3708
02:41:26.332 --> 02:41:27.595
MARISHA: I am proficient.

3709
02:41:27.595 --> 02:41:28.477
MATT: Well, I asked about that earlier.

3710
02:41:28.477 --> 02:41:29.723
MARISHA: But I didn't do it earlier,

3711
02:41:29.723 --> 02:41:30.847
because I wasn't really a part of it.

3712
02:41:30.847 --> 02:41:33.180
MATT: Then go ahead and roll it.

3713
02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:35.345
MARISHA: Ooh!

3714
02:41:35.345 --> 02:41:36.892
TALIESIN: Five.

3715
02:41:36.892 --> 02:41:38.499
MARISHA: 24.

3716
02:41:38.499 --> 02:41:39.708
SAM: Jesus.
LAURA: Yes!

3717
02:41:39.708 --> 02:41:40.599
MARISHA: Yeah.

3718
02:41:40.599 --> 02:41:43.959
MATT: So Beauregard hears this and goes, "Oh yeah,"

3719
02:41:43.959 --> 02:41:45.971
you totally recall, yeah.

3720
02:41:45.971 --> 02:41:47.395
MARISHA: Yeah, I read about that shit.

3721
02:41:47.395 --> 02:41:49.237
LAURA: That's where we are, we're at the Arbor Exemplar.

3722
02:41:49.237 --> 02:41:52.419
MATT: So following the final confrontation

3723
02:41:52.419 --> 02:41:56.213
and the banishing of the Betrayer Gods

3724
02:41:56.213 --> 02:41:58.779
towards the end of the Calamity and the following

3725
02:41:58.779 --> 02:42:01.283
Divergence before all the Prime Deities

3726
02:42:01.283 --> 02:42:06.174
left Exandria to go beyond and construct the Divine Gate,

3727
02:42:06.174 --> 02:42:09.803
the Wildmother buried this seed

3728
02:42:09.803 --> 02:42:14.803
within the most desolate land at the time

3729
02:42:15.235 --> 02:42:18.879
to leave behind a

3730
02:42:18.879 --> 02:42:22.833
a beacon of life and hope in a place which

3731
02:42:22.833 --> 02:42:26.959
absolute destruction at that time reigned.

3732
02:42:26.959 --> 02:42:28.443
This is what the Barbed Fields looks like now;

3733
02:42:28.443 --> 02:42:29.855
imagine what it would have looked like

3734
02:42:29.855 --> 02:42:31.655
at the end of those battles.

3735
02:42:31.655 --> 02:42:33.843
So this is considered the sister tree

3736
02:42:33.843 --> 02:42:36.123
to the Seed of Rebirth, which is the tree that

3737
02:42:36.123 --> 02:42:38.880
resides in the Birthheart of Vasselheim.

3738
02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:42.063
TRAVIS: Oh shit, sister tree!

3739
02:42:42.063 --> 02:42:44.538
MARISHA: Sister tree.

3740
02:42:44.538 --> 02:42:45.887
ASHLEY: ♪ Sister, sister. ♪

3741
02:42:45.887 --> 02:42:47.823
TRAVIS: That's growing a monster underneath it

3742
02:42:47.823 --> 02:42:49.124
in a box of ashes.

3743
02:42:49.124 --> 02:42:51.457
MATT: You read my fucking notes.

3744
02:42:53.223 --> 02:42:55.154
MARISHA: So I say all of that.

3745
02:42:55.154 --> 02:42:58.951
SAM: Wow, this is a special tree. What's a Vasselheim?

3746
02:42:58.951 --> 02:43:03.887
MARISHA: Oh, it's another city in another continent

3747
02:43:03.887 --> 02:43:06.387
far away.
SAM: What's a continent?

3748
02:43:07.367 --> 02:43:08.200
It's fine.

3749
02:43:10.007 --> 02:43:12.483
LIAM: Sam, take the hood down so you don't

3750
02:43:12.483 --> 02:43:13.787
die of heat stroke, please.

3751
02:43:13.787 --> 02:43:15.953
LAURA: I mean, you're sweating your makeup off.

3752
02:43:15.953 --> 02:43:19.083
TRAVIS: It's like fever dream.
LAURA: No, don't!

3753
02:43:19.083 --> 02:43:20.177
LIAM: No, take the hood down.

3754
02:43:20.177 --> 02:43:22.088
Stop, you look like you're in a--

3755
02:43:22.088 --> 02:43:24.014
MATT: Johnny, Johnny put the cup down.

3756
02:43:24.014 --> 02:43:25.714
(angry yell) (crashing)

3757
02:43:26.911 --> 02:43:29.535
LIAM: Take it down, take the hood down.

3758
02:43:29.535 --> 02:43:30.941
SAM: Don't you spray me.
LIAM: Take it down.

3759
02:43:30.941 --> 02:43:31.825
Take that hood down.

3760
02:43:31.825 --> 02:43:33.133
LAURA: Don't spray me, too.

3761
02:43:33.133 --> 02:43:36.243
SAM: All right, I'll take the hood down.

3762
02:43:36.243 --> 02:43:37.076
LIAM: Okay.

3763
02:43:38.037 --> 02:43:39.120
MATT: Compromise.

3764
02:43:39.985 --> 02:43:42.313
Back where we started.

3765
02:43:42.313 --> 02:43:43.146
All right.

3766
02:43:45.793 --> 02:43:49.497
You can still hear the rain pouring

3767
02:43:49.497 --> 02:43:50.577
on the outside of the dome,

3768
02:43:50.577 --> 02:43:53.305
smacking against the arcane force field

3769
02:43:53.305 --> 02:43:56.722
that keeps you protected for the evening.

3770
02:43:57.745 --> 02:44:01.995
What would you guys like to do before bedding down?

3771
02:44:02.893 --> 02:44:06.192
MARISHA: Should we scry on

3772
02:44:06.192 --> 02:44:08.218
the guy we're chasing?

3773
02:44:08.218 --> 02:44:10.473
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah.
SAM: It's been a while.

3774
02:44:10.473 --> 02:44:13.445
MARISHA: He saved against it before, right?

3775
02:44:13.445 --> 02:44:15.561
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Try it again?

3776
02:44:15.561 --> 02:44:17.674
TRAVIS: If they save, do they know that we were scrying?

3777
02:44:17.674 --> 02:44:18.507
LAURA: No.

3778
02:44:20.405 --> 02:44:22.189
Okay, I can try.

3779
02:44:22.189 --> 02:44:24.797
MATT: Okay, you're attempting to scry on

3780
02:44:24.797 --> 02:44:27.163
the dark elf that you're

3781
02:44:27.163 --> 02:44:28.345
attempting to follow.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3782
02:44:28.345 --> 02:44:29.933
SAM: Obann, is that his name?

3783
02:44:29.933 --> 02:44:31.257
MATT: Obann is what you heard

3784
02:44:31.257 --> 02:44:34.548
from the corpse of the hobgoblin.

3785
02:44:34.548 --> 02:44:35.990
LAURA: I want to scry on him.

3786
02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:38.283
SAM: Want to use his name just to freak him out?

3787
02:44:38.283 --> 02:44:40.326
LAURA: He doesn't know I'm there.
MATT: A natural six.

3788
02:44:40.326 --> 02:44:42.366
LAURA: Yeah, succeedies.

3789
02:44:42.366 --> 02:44:44.046
SAM: Oh, you're not talking to him, you're scrying.

3790
02:44:44.046 --> 02:44:45.546
LAURA: No, I'm scrying.

3791
02:44:47.826 --> 02:44:48.659
MATT: So

3792
02:44:51.306 --> 02:44:55.326
here in the rainy night, you concentrate,

3793
02:44:55.326 --> 02:44:57.710
and for a moment you're having a hard time

3794
02:44:57.710 --> 02:45:01.385
grasping onto the thread of this individual.

3795
02:45:01.385 --> 02:45:06.377
Something seems unfocused, and then

3796
02:45:07.778 --> 02:45:11.858
you have the familiar billowing of green robes

3797
02:45:11.858 --> 02:45:14.824
and hands reach out and clasp your fingers together

3798
02:45:14.824 --> 02:45:19.046
and show you, like a teacher correcting your posture

3799
02:45:19.046 --> 02:45:21.962
and as the hood looms to your left side,

3800
02:45:21.962 --> 02:45:24.195
you see the smile on the Traveler's face

3801
02:45:24.195 --> 02:45:27.362
and says, "Just like I taught you,"

3802
02:45:30.988 --> 02:45:33.450
With that, you're off and thrust through the rain

3803
02:45:33.450 --> 02:45:35.550
and the storm at an impossible speed

3804
02:45:35.550 --> 02:45:38.094
before you readjust once more, the rain all around you.

3805
02:45:38.094 --> 02:45:39.806
You can sense the cold and the wetness.

3806
02:45:39.806 --> 02:45:41.982
It's strange because you're not wet, you're not present,

3807
02:45:41.982 --> 02:45:44.274
but you feel like you should and instinctually

3808
02:45:44.274 --> 02:45:46.886
your body is going through the physical motions,

3809
02:45:46.886 --> 02:45:50.047
but you're dry and you can feel it where you're sitting.

3810
02:45:50.047 --> 02:45:55.013
What you do see, however, is a varied, darkened

3811
02:45:55.887 --> 02:45:59.137
rock surface of the base of a mountain.

3812
02:46:02.455 --> 02:46:06.355
You occasionally see flashes of light from nearby,

3813
02:46:06.355 --> 02:46:08.503
bolts over this ten minute period

3814
02:46:08.503 --> 02:46:10.735
that help make out shapes,

3815
02:46:10.735 --> 02:46:14.364
but you see this figure wrapped in the same clothing

3816
02:46:14.364 --> 02:46:17.264
as when they escaped Rosohna.

3817
02:46:18.627 --> 02:46:20.323
They're no longer on horseback.

3818
02:46:20.323 --> 02:46:22.767
Instead, he walks among strong,

3819
02:46:22.767 --> 02:46:24.430
buffeting winds that are tossing

3820
02:46:24.430 --> 02:46:27.703
mud and muck past him, the rain blasting down

3821
02:46:27.703 --> 02:46:29.863
on the shoulders and head.

3822
02:46:29.863 --> 02:46:33.113
He's feeling across the surface of the mountain.

3823
02:46:33.113 --> 02:46:36.267
Fingers and hands just poring across it,

3824
02:46:36.267 --> 02:46:38.719
feeling the nooks and crannies,

3825
02:46:38.719 --> 02:46:41.823
slowly inspecting and carefully

3826
02:46:41.823 --> 02:46:44.156
scanning with his hands

3827
02:46:45.155 --> 02:46:47.113
along the rock.

3828
02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:53.120
You can see, what you assume to be based on the dark stone

3829
02:46:53.478 --> 02:46:55.443
here and the north direction you're passing,

3830
02:46:55.443 --> 02:46:57.736
to be the base of the Penumbra Range.

3831
02:46:57.736 --> 02:46:59.299
Mountains that curve across

3832
02:46:59.299 --> 02:47:01.381
the top of the Barbed Fields

3833
02:47:01.381 --> 02:47:05.940
and encompass most of the eastern side of Xhorhas.

3834
02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:08.012
He's searching.

3835
02:47:08.012 --> 02:47:10.762
He's searching and then he stops.

3836
02:47:11.763 --> 02:47:13.083
LAURA: Can I see what his fingers are doing?

3837
02:47:13.083 --> 02:47:16.035
MATT: Make a perception check.

3838
02:47:16.035 --> 02:47:18.015
MARISHA: Come on, Jessie.

3839
02:47:18.015 --> 02:47:19.432
SAM: Come on, Jessie.

3840
02:47:22.339 --> 02:47:23.447
LAURA: 13.

3841
02:47:23.447 --> 02:47:26.075
MATT: It's hard to make out the details,

3842
02:47:26.075 --> 02:47:28.099
but it seems like his body shifts

3843
02:47:28.099 --> 02:47:29.447
like he's found something.

3844
02:47:29.447 --> 02:47:32.795
Something has changed, the body tenses

3845
02:47:32.795 --> 02:47:36.635
and he stops this slow, gradual drifting across

3846
02:47:36.635 --> 02:47:38.644
the mountain base.

3847
02:47:38.644 --> 02:47:42.796
He takes a step back and reaches into the pack

3848
02:47:42.796 --> 02:47:45.047
and pulls out something.

3849
02:47:45.047 --> 02:47:50.047
It's a small stone crest of some kind.

3850
02:47:50.061 --> 02:47:52.276
LAURA: (whispering) The crest that he bought.

3851
02:47:52.276 --> 02:47:54.067
MATT: He puts it back

3852
02:47:54.067 --> 02:47:57.239
in his pouch and he continues searching.

3853
02:47:57.239 --> 02:47:59.507
Apparently didn't quite discover

3854
02:47:59.507 --> 02:48:01.507
what he thought he did.

3855
02:48:03.075 --> 02:48:04.325
LAURA: Can I see any

3856
02:48:05.611 --> 02:48:08.742
noticeable features in the landscape?

3857
02:48:08.742 --> 02:48:11.083
Anything that sticks out that--

3858
02:48:11.083 --> 02:48:12.666
MATT: Unfortunately, the

3859
02:48:12.666 --> 02:48:14.649
scrying is centered around the figure

3860
02:48:14.649 --> 02:48:16.139
and what you can see is just what's

3861
02:48:16.139 --> 02:48:19.086
directly around. Plus, the lack of true light

3862
02:48:19.086 --> 02:48:20.870
and the middle of the rain storm,

3863
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:22.292
it's a tough space to make out

3864
02:48:22.292 --> 02:48:23.882
any sort of details in the vicinity.

3865
02:48:23.882 --> 02:48:25.350
What you do make out is

3866
02:48:25.350 --> 02:48:26.786
based on the back on the fact that he's not

3867
02:48:26.786 --> 02:48:29.498
directly on a cliff or mountainside,

3868
02:48:29.498 --> 02:48:31.134
there is a gradual curve

3869
02:48:31.134 --> 02:48:34.149
and there is the familiar mud and dirt of

3870
02:48:34.149 --> 02:48:36.430
the Barbed Fields around his feet as he moves.

3871
02:48:36.430 --> 02:48:39.338
This is near the base of the mountain.

3872
02:48:39.338 --> 02:48:40.718
SAM: But it's raining where he is, too?

3873
02:48:40.718 --> 02:48:41.551
LAURA: Yeah.

3874
02:48:42.894 --> 02:48:44.259
MARISHA: Same storm.

3875
02:48:44.259 --> 02:48:45.878
MATT: About ten minutes of watching this transpire--

3876
02:48:45.878 --> 02:48:46.711
LAURA: And he looks the same
SAM: ♪ Somewhere ♪

3877
02:48:46.711 --> 02:48:48.102
as he did before?

3878
02:48:48.102 --> 02:48:50.765
MATT: As best as you can tell.
SAM: ♪ Out there. ♪

3879
02:48:53.258 --> 02:48:54.278
LAURA: That's the song I sing to Ronin

3880
02:48:54.278 --> 02:48:56.291
every night when he goes to sleep.

3881
02:48:56.291 --> 02:48:57.124
SAM: The whole thing?

3882
02:48:57.124 --> 02:48:57.962
LAURA: Yeah.

3883
02:48:57.962 --> 02:48:58.795
SAM: Aw!

3884
02:49:00.256 --> 02:49:02.884
MATT: Ten minutes transpire, same moments

3885
02:49:02.884 --> 02:49:06.045
occasionally stopping and feeling and continuing

3886
02:49:06.045 --> 02:49:10.832
and you're pulled back into yourself within the dome.

3887
02:49:10.832 --> 02:49:13.744
SAM: What song do you sing, Travis?

3888
02:49:13.744 --> 02:49:15.856
LAURA: He was looking for

3889
02:49:15.856 --> 02:49:18.989
a secret passage or something in the base

3890
02:49:18.989 --> 02:49:20.406
of the mountains.

3891
02:49:21.376 --> 02:49:23.568
The rain is still on him, so he's not

3892
02:49:23.568 --> 02:49:26.524
that far ahead of us, or the maybe the storm is that big,

3893
02:49:26.524 --> 02:49:29.732
I'm not sure, but he was searching around

3894
02:49:29.732 --> 02:49:32.775
and then he pulled out what looked like a crest.

3895
02:49:32.775 --> 02:49:34.394
So I'm thinking that's probably what he bought

3896
02:49:34.394 --> 02:49:36.311
from that guy and then,

3897
02:49:38.944 --> 02:49:41.044
I didn't see him open a door or anything.

3898
02:49:41.044 --> 02:49:43.352
SAM: But he's close enough that we might be

3899
02:49:43.352 --> 02:49:44.836
wishing on the same bright star.

3900
02:49:44.836 --> 02:49:46.745
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Wow.

3901
02:49:52.048 --> 02:49:53.770
LIAM: If we are to get closer,

3902
02:49:53.770 --> 02:49:56.651
are you able to track him by that crest as well?

3903
02:49:56.651 --> 02:49:58.736
LAURA: I mean, I could, I saw it.

3904
02:49:58.736 --> 02:50:01.091
Did I see it enough to be able to Locate Object

3905
02:50:01.091 --> 02:50:03.697
on that crest that I saw him pull out?

3906
02:50:03.697 --> 02:50:05.121
MATT: Possibly, yeah. I mean, you didn't get

3907
02:50:05.121 --> 02:50:07.193
all the details of it, but you saw what it looked like

3908
02:50:07.193 --> 02:50:08.538
so you have a strong enough idea

3909
02:50:08.538 --> 02:50:10.913
that with Locate Object, you could find that crest.

3910
02:50:10.913 --> 02:50:13.262
ASHLEY: What was he doing with the crest?

3911
02:50:13.262 --> 02:50:16.762
LAURA: I feel like, I don't know if it was like

3912
02:50:17.765 --> 02:50:22.133
a key, maybe or something. Like it would have gone in a

3913
02:50:22.133 --> 02:50:25.233
knot in the woods, in the mountain,

3914
02:50:25.233 --> 02:50:29.947
or if maybe it had a code on it or something,

3915
02:50:29.947 --> 02:50:30.839
I don't know.

3916
02:50:30.839 --> 02:50:32.339
MARISHA: Pass me the map?

3917
02:50:35.895 --> 02:50:37.979
TRAVIS: Pass me the map.

3918
02:50:37.979 --> 02:50:39.615
LAURA: But I could see, you know,

3919
02:50:39.615 --> 02:50:42.075
what looked like the Barbed Fields right behind him.

3920
02:50:42.075 --> 02:50:45.059
SAM: He was searching for something just in random rocks?

3921
02:50:45.059 --> 02:50:46.875
LAURA: Yeah, it was-- no, no, no,

3922
02:50:46.875 --> 02:50:48.883
he was like walking along the mountain range

3923
02:50:48.883 --> 02:50:51.388
and feeling along the rocks.

3924
02:50:51.388 --> 02:50:53.307
SAM: Do you think it was an entrance he was looking for?

3925
02:50:53.307 --> 02:50:54.734
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean. He was looking for

3926
02:50:54.734 --> 02:50:56.401
a door or something.

3927
02:50:57.283 --> 02:50:59.585
SAM: All right, that's good.

3928
02:50:59.585 --> 02:51:01.176
LAURA: Yeah?
LIAM: Maybe.

3929
02:51:01.176 --> 02:51:03.223
SAM: Was he alone, no troops with him?

3930
02:51:03.223 --> 02:51:04.888
LAURA: I didn't see anyone.

3931
02:51:04.888 --> 02:51:05.721
SAM: Okay.

3932
02:51:07.528 --> 02:51:09.511
TALIESIN: I mean that's not really how it works.

3933
02:51:09.511 --> 02:51:10.771
You don't really see what's around you,

3934
02:51:10.771 --> 02:51:12.091
you just see what's happening.

3935
02:51:12.091 --> 02:51:15.474
MARISHA: If that's the case, he headed east,

3936
02:51:16.768 --> 02:51:21.743
He didn't head-- unless it's that cluster.

3937
02:51:22.891 --> 02:51:24.891
TRAVIS: North is the water, so.

3938
02:51:27.271 --> 02:51:29.593
LIAM: I mean, with endless mountains it will be hard to know

3939
02:51:29.593 --> 02:51:32.803
if he disappears into them where he went in.

3940
02:51:32.803 --> 02:51:34.063
SAM: We know what--

3941
02:51:34.063 --> 02:51:38.491
we know that he-- how do we know he went to Bozozo?

3942
02:51:38.491 --> 02:51:39.839
Bozozan?

3943
02:51:39.839 --> 02:51:41.189
Bozistan?

3944
02:51:41.189 --> 02:51:44.311
LIAM: Barbizon College.
SAM: Barbizon Modeling School?

3945
02:51:44.311 --> 02:51:46.094
MATT: Bazzoxan was mentioned the conversation

3946
02:51:46.094 --> 02:51:48.169
with the dragonborn.

3947
02:51:48.169 --> 02:51:49.559
When it was acquired, the dragonborn was like,

3948
02:51:49.559 --> 02:51:51.539
"Nope, I don't want anything to do with Bazzoxan."

3949
02:51:51.539 --> 02:51:52.372
SAM: Got it.

3950
02:51:52.372 --> 02:51:53.323
LAURA: I think you overheard them saying that.

3951
02:51:53.323 --> 02:51:56.039
SAM: That's right, I knew that.

3952
02:51:56.039 --> 02:51:57.968
Okay, but we're not sure if that's

3953
02:51:57.968 --> 02:51:59.383
their base of operations or that's where--

3954
02:51:59.383 --> 02:52:01.466
LAURA: Your makeup is like so shiny.

3955
02:52:01.466 --> 02:52:03.027
SAM: Do I need some powder?

3956
02:52:03.027 --> 02:52:04.287
LAURA: It's like distracting.

3957
02:52:04.287 --> 02:52:05.427
LIAM: You need to take that hood off.

3958
02:52:05.427 --> 02:52:06.260
SAM: It's the rain.

3959
02:52:06.260 --> 02:52:07.603
MATT: It's going to haunt me tonight.

3960
02:52:07.603 --> 02:52:08.436
LIAM: Take that off.

3961
02:52:08.436 --> 02:52:11.719
MARISHA: It looks like your skin is gasping for air.

3962
02:52:11.719 --> 02:52:13.115
SAM: No, I'm wearing the same makeup

3963
02:52:13.115 --> 02:52:15.759
that the original Tin Man wore in Wizard of Oz.

3964
02:52:15.759 --> 02:52:17.004
MARISHA: Uh-huh!

3965
02:52:17.004 --> 02:52:18.179
That's exactly how I feel.

3966
02:52:18.179 --> 02:52:19.876
TRAVIS: Lead-based? That's good.

3967
02:52:19.876 --> 02:52:20.975
MARISHA: Slightly deadly, yeah.

3968
02:52:20.975 --> 02:52:22.843
SAM: It'll be fine.

3969
02:52:22.843 --> 02:52:25.593
MARISHA: Hospitalize you for six months.

3970
02:52:27.551 --> 02:52:29.676
Cool, well.

3971
02:52:30.643 --> 02:52:32.140
SAM: But we don't know if that's where he was going

3972
02:52:32.140 --> 02:52:34.559
or if that's where his base of operations is

3973
02:52:34.559 --> 02:52:37.947
so we should keep heading that way.

3974
02:52:37.947 --> 02:52:39.614
Until we learn more.

3975
02:52:41.487 --> 02:52:42.659
Good night.

3976
02:52:42.659 --> 02:52:44.547
TRAVIS: Good night.

3977
02:52:44.547 --> 02:52:47.321
MATT: All right, you guys are

3978
02:52:47.321 --> 02:52:48.403
bedding down for the evening.

3979
02:52:48.403 --> 02:52:50.051
Are you taking watches or y'all just going full

3980
02:52:50.051 --> 02:52:51.251
straight to sleep?

3981
02:52:51.251 --> 02:52:52.084
LIAM: I'll take watch.

3982
02:52:52.084 --> 02:52:54.403
SAM: I'll do one with Cay.

3983
02:52:54.403 --> 02:52:56.108
MATT: All right, you guys take first watch.

3984
02:52:56.108 --> 02:52:56.941
The rest of you are asleep.

3985
02:52:56.941 --> 02:53:00.524
Go ahead and roll perception checks, please.

3986
02:53:02.682 --> 02:53:03.515
SAM: 13.

3987
02:53:04.543 --> 02:53:05.411
LIAM: 16.

3988
02:53:05.411 --> 02:53:06.852
MATT: 16, okay.

3989
02:53:06.852 --> 02:53:08.589
Keeping an eye out, nothing draws

3990
02:53:08.589 --> 02:53:09.523
too close to the vicinity.

3991
02:53:09.523 --> 02:53:13.751
You do notice over the period of your guys' watch, though,

3992
02:53:13.751 --> 02:53:16.603
tiny little beads of green begin to push up

3993
02:53:16.603 --> 02:53:19.270
from the ground within the dome.

3994
02:53:20.667 --> 02:53:21.849
You glance in and look.

3995
02:53:21.849 --> 02:53:23.455
There is, by then end of your watch,

3996
02:53:23.455 --> 02:53:27.352
about an inch or so of fresh grass growing.

3997
02:53:27.352 --> 02:53:30.324
LIAM: So what is this dome shielding the grass from?

3998
02:53:30.324 --> 02:53:33.895
SAM: Doesn't it shield from magic effects?

3999
02:53:33.895 --> 02:53:37.810
LIAM: Nothing can get in or out, yeah, just us.

4000
02:53:37.810 --> 02:53:39.311
SAM: So there's some magic effect

4001
02:53:39.311 --> 02:53:41.907
that's sort of emanating from this place.

4002
02:53:41.907 --> 02:53:44.981
Well no, maybe just from the--

4003
02:53:44.981 --> 02:53:46.451
this was a battlefield, right?

4004
02:53:46.451 --> 02:53:48.403
Maybe from the battlefield.

4005
02:53:48.403 --> 02:53:51.475
LIAM: Yeah, but this dome protects from what's above,

4006
02:53:51.475 --> 02:53:54.851
not from what's below, so something around--

4007
02:53:54.851 --> 02:53:58.483
It's not the ground itself, I don't think.

4008
02:53:58.483 --> 02:54:00.763
If the dome is having an effect.

4009
02:54:00.763 --> 02:54:02.727
SAM: Could be those big spikies?

4010
02:54:02.727 --> 02:54:05.683
LIAM: Maybe, I have a lot of questions about those.

4011
02:54:05.683 --> 02:54:06.791
I don't know if you noticed,

4012
02:54:06.791 --> 02:54:08.083
but they're getting closer together.

4013
02:54:08.083 --> 02:54:10.767
It reminds me. You know when I throw

4014
02:54:10.767 --> 02:54:12.927
a ball of fire and it hits the ground,

4015
02:54:12.927 --> 02:54:16.075
and the scorch marks left get fainter and fainter

4016
02:54:16.075 --> 02:54:18.883
out from the center. I'm wondering if we're heading

4017
02:54:18.883 --> 02:54:22.133
toward the heart of

4018
02:54:22.133 --> 02:54:25.199
some sort of ancient explosion

4019
02:54:25.199 --> 02:54:29.616
or eruption. Could be a coincidence.

4020
02:54:30.740 --> 02:54:31.823
I don't know.

4021
02:54:32.690 --> 02:54:33.956
SAM: Woof.

4022
02:54:35.623 --> 02:54:38.323
LIAM: How are you feeling about all of this?

4023
02:54:38.323 --> 02:54:40.155
SAM: I'm feeling okay.

4024
02:54:40.155 --> 02:54:41.405
It's nice to be

4025
02:54:42.435 --> 02:54:46.810
out on a real mission with you guys again.

4026
02:54:49.406 --> 02:54:52.003
LIAM: Have you thought anymore about your boy?

4027
02:54:52.003 --> 02:54:53.561
SAM: Of course, but we haven't--

4028
02:54:53.561 --> 02:54:57.323
Maybe I should tell Jester to check in with Shakäste.

4029
02:54:57.323 --> 02:54:58.887
I think we still have a couple days

4030
02:54:58.887 --> 02:55:01.220
before he's meant to arrive.

4031
02:55:02.367 --> 02:55:04.875
I don't want to just-- I can't really send a message to him

4032
02:55:04.875 --> 02:55:08.307
because he won't much understand.

4033
02:55:08.307 --> 02:55:11.759
Jester, I love her, but she's really bad

4034
02:55:11.759 --> 02:55:13.902
at sending messages.

4035
02:55:13.902 --> 02:55:16.335
She might say something awful

4036
02:55:16.335 --> 02:55:19.316
that just scars my son for life.

4037
02:55:19.316 --> 02:55:23.247
So I'm reluctant to have her send him a message.

4038
02:55:23.247 --> 02:55:25.498
You know what I mean?

4039
02:55:25.498 --> 02:55:26.983
She could say just something like,

4040
02:55:26.983 --> 02:55:28.781
"Ah, you're, everything's fine.

4041
02:55:28.781 --> 02:55:31.138
"Your mother was eaten by a goblin or," I don't know.

4042
02:55:31.138 --> 02:55:32.907
I don't know what she'll say. She's crazy.

4043
02:55:32.907 --> 02:55:35.175
LIAM: For your son or Shakäste, you could try

4044
02:55:35.175 --> 02:55:36.855
to work out some talking points in advance.

4045
02:55:36.855 --> 02:55:38.614
SAM: That's an idea, that's a good idea.

4046
02:55:38.614 --> 02:55:41.096
LIAM: Write them down for both of you to look at, you know.

4047
02:55:41.096 --> 02:55:42.391
SAM: I'll think about that.

4048
02:55:42.391 --> 02:55:43.340
LIAM: Like a script.

4049
02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:45.319
SAM: A script.

4050
02:55:45.319 --> 02:55:49.832
Good thinking. How are you doing? How are you feeling?

4051
02:55:49.832 --> 02:55:50.665
LIAM: Good.

4052
02:55:51.916 --> 02:55:55.112
I don't feel too strong about how things went

4053
02:55:55.112 --> 02:55:56.862
back in the city.

4054
02:55:59.176 --> 02:56:01.620
Actually, I'm kind of losing faith here.

4055
02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:06.537
I mean, we're heading, how are we going to find this person?

4056
02:56:07.652 --> 02:56:10.485
SAM: Well, I mean, Jester can see him.

4057
02:56:11.534 --> 02:56:14.184
Jester can talk to him.

4058
02:56:14.184 --> 02:56:18.039
We seem to have the favor of a couple of gods.

4059
02:56:18.039 --> 02:56:21.983
Maybe Yasha's god will come through in a pinch.

4060
02:56:21.983 --> 02:56:24.552
LIAM: That seems a little nebulous to me.

4061
02:56:24.552 --> 02:56:25.385
Maybe.

4062
02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:29.484
I don't know.

4063
02:56:29.484 --> 02:56:31.660
Maybe it'll come to us while we're sleeping.

4064
02:56:31.660 --> 02:56:32.493
SAM: Maybe.

4065
02:56:38.821 --> 02:56:41.271
LIAM: Do you want my vulture?

4066
02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:43.239
Tonight?

4067
02:56:43.239 --> 02:56:44.536
SAM: Yes, please.

4068
02:56:44.536 --> 02:56:46.146
LIAM: Okay.

4069
02:56:46.146 --> 02:56:47.325
(vulture croaking)

4070
02:56:47.325 --> 02:56:48.820
SAM: Oh god!

4071
02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:50.784
Oh Jesus.

4072
02:56:50.784 --> 02:56:53.034
That thing's scary, oh shit.

4073
02:56:54.056 --> 02:56:57.940
LIAM: Flaps then roosts on Nott's shoulder.

4074
02:56:57.940 --> 02:56:59.876
MATT: It hurts.

4075
02:56:59.876 --> 02:57:01.543
SAM: It's as big as me.

4076
02:57:03.056 --> 02:57:04.597
LIAM: It does that thing that cats do.

4077
02:57:04.597 --> 02:57:06.822
It just does biscuits.

4078
02:57:06.822 --> 02:57:08.079
MATT: With its razor talons.

4079
02:57:08.079 --> 02:57:12.355
LIAM: It eventually eases out and just leans against him.

4080
02:57:12.355 --> 02:57:14.272
MARISHA: ♪ Take my bird tonight. ♪

4081
02:57:15.729 --> 02:57:17.588
MATT: Caduceus.

4082
02:57:19.332 --> 02:57:22.360
In your comfortable night's sleep,

4083
02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:25.958
sometimes you dream, sometimes you don't.

4084
02:57:25.958 --> 02:57:29.291
And tonight begins as a dreamless night.

4085
02:57:31.256 --> 02:57:35.256
But then colors begin to come through your mind.

4086
02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:39.407
That warm presence returns

4087
02:57:41.892 --> 02:57:46.825
and you can sense the gaze of the Wildmother, Melora,

4088
02:57:47.904 --> 02:57:49.654
turn to bend towards you

4089
02:57:52.616 --> 02:57:54.760
hoping to bring some clarity to

4090
02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:57.427
those blurred colors before you.

4091
02:57:59.557 --> 02:58:03.561
As the vision slowly comes into focus and crystallizes,

4092
02:58:03.561 --> 02:58:08.539
you see an image of snow and ice capped mountains

4093
02:58:08.539 --> 02:58:12.732
bordering an endless desert of white glass beads

4094
02:58:12.732 --> 02:58:16.649
glistening against the sun of an open blue sky.

4095
02:58:18.328 --> 02:58:22.120
You see within those mountains, a monstrous peak

4096
02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:24.503
where no snow lives

4097
02:58:25.852 --> 02:58:30.269
and a black cloud drifting lazily out from its apex.

4098
02:58:33.448 --> 02:58:37.032
And then you look towards the belly of this mountain.

4099
02:58:37.032 --> 02:58:39.532
Bubbling, broiling molten rock

4100
02:58:40.452 --> 02:58:44.285
settled within an iron pool.

4101
02:58:45.552 --> 02:58:50.319
The top of which sits a black iron anvil.

4102
02:58:52.854 --> 02:58:55.316
Your vision clarifies further.

4103
02:58:55.316 --> 02:58:58.632
On the surface of this molten rock,

4104
02:58:58.632 --> 02:59:01.856
just ever so slightly shifting,

4105
02:59:01.856 --> 02:59:05.484
you can see the orange and yellow and red glows

4106
02:59:05.484 --> 02:59:10.475
against darkened black cooled crust on the top

4107
02:59:11.592 --> 02:59:16.592
and you watch as grains of

4108
02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:19.342
greenish glass-like sand

4109
02:59:20.184 --> 02:59:25.159
tumble onto the surface and steam and hiss

4110
02:59:26.244 --> 02:59:31.244
and merge and grow into shards of

4111
02:59:31.867 --> 02:59:35.342
newly formed purple-like crystal.

4112
02:59:39.465 --> 02:59:43.332
Your vision blurs again and you start to lose focus

4113
02:59:43.332 --> 02:59:46.845
and drift away and her presence comes back and guides you

4114
02:59:46.845 --> 02:59:48.493
like a warm breeze at your back,

4115
02:59:48.493 --> 02:59:51.765
it prevents you from being buffeted off-course,

4116
02:59:51.765 --> 02:59:54.267
and back towards a specific direction.

4117
02:59:54.267 --> 02:59:56.233
Your vision begins to slowly crystallize

4118
02:59:56.233 --> 03:00:01.233
back into focus and as it does, the colors are different.

4119
03:00:01.570 --> 03:00:05.341
You have visions of a mammoth ravine

4120
03:00:05.341 --> 03:00:09.689
of gray and dark rock carved into the earth.

4121
03:00:09.689 --> 03:00:12.772
It's steeped in shadow and along its

4122
03:00:14.441 --> 03:00:18.415
southernmost base, you see a rudimentary city

4123
03:00:18.415 --> 03:00:19.990
rising.

4124
03:00:22.229 --> 03:00:25.845
Below and beyond that, you see a shore.

4125
03:00:25.845 --> 03:00:28.709
A beautiful, untouched shore

4126
03:00:28.709 --> 03:00:31.542
with beaches and tumultuous earth.

4127
03:00:33.033 --> 03:00:34.991
Your vision focuses even further

4128
03:00:34.991 --> 03:00:39.837
and you can see the nearby jungles along this coast.

4129
03:00:39.837 --> 03:00:43.420
Within this dense jungle, there is an oasis,

4130
03:00:46.018 --> 03:00:48.929
a lake sitting solitary

4131
03:00:48.929 --> 03:00:52.649
amongst the tangled trees and vines.

4132
03:00:52.649 --> 03:00:55.732
You see beasts called to drink at it

4133
03:00:58.407 --> 03:01:00.645
and along its edge,

4134
03:01:00.645 --> 03:01:03.553
where the red earth and rock forms a cavern.

4135
03:01:03.553 --> 03:01:05.773
The cavern twists and winds where you can see

4136
03:01:05.773 --> 03:01:10.773
thick, heavy veins of gold spiraling down

4137
03:01:11.369 --> 03:01:15.765
like frozen bolts of lighting built into the rock

4138
03:01:15.765 --> 03:01:19.707
before it reveals a temple.

4139
03:01:22.605 --> 03:01:25.993
Natural water drifting down from the lake above

4140
03:01:25.993 --> 03:01:27.660
fitting into a pool.

4141
03:01:30.465 --> 03:01:35.136
You see these purple crystals fall into

4142
03:01:35.136 --> 03:01:37.893
the waters of this pool.

4143
03:01:37.893 --> 03:01:41.143
These crystals begin to grow roots,

4144
03:01:42.525 --> 03:01:45.692
like crystal fingers along their base.

4145
03:01:48.733 --> 03:01:52.141
Your vision loses focus and you drift back

4146
03:01:52.141 --> 03:01:55.949
into the darkness of your dreamless night

4147
03:01:55.949 --> 03:01:58.033
and sleep probably the best sleep you've had

4148
03:01:58.033 --> 03:01:59.450
in quite a while.

4149
03:02:04.631 --> 03:02:06.241
Fjord.

4150
03:02:06.241 --> 03:02:08.284
SAM: Oh shit.

4151
03:02:08.284 --> 03:02:09.601
MARISHA: So many visions.

4152
03:02:09.601 --> 03:02:13.605
TRAVIS: It's probably chill, just like Caduceus'.

4153
03:02:13.605 --> 03:02:17.353
MATT: Your sleep slowly fades.

4154
03:02:17.353 --> 03:02:19.725
Your body cold with a biting wind

4155
03:02:19.725 --> 03:02:21.558
that cuts through you.

4156
03:02:22.425 --> 03:02:24.389
Not wind,

4157
03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:26.909
but chilling current.

4158
03:02:26.909 --> 03:02:29.265
You open your eyes and see nothing but shadow

4159
03:02:29.265 --> 03:02:31.485
and your arms move sluggishly against the familiar

4160
03:02:31.485 --> 03:02:36.068
icy waters that portent the prying will of your patron.

4161
03:02:37.811 --> 03:02:42.761
Your heart rate begins to race and jump

4162
03:02:43.724 --> 03:02:46.561
knowing what this brings and as that fear

4163
03:02:46.561 --> 03:02:48.493
wells up into your throat,

4164
03:02:48.493 --> 03:02:52.545
you hear the familiar voice call from the darkness.

4165
03:02:52.545 --> 03:02:54.920
"Return."

4166
03:02:57.269 --> 03:03:00.689
A yellow glow pulses in your chest.

4167
03:03:00.689 --> 03:03:02.429
The orb that remains embedded within your body

4168
03:03:02.429 --> 03:03:05.669
shines through the skin like a dull lantern.

4169
03:03:05.669 --> 03:03:09.225
You look from your chest to see the gargantuan lid

4170
03:03:09.225 --> 03:03:12.045
of the familiar spotlight-like yellow eye

4171
03:03:12.045 --> 03:03:14.295
fill your entire periphery.

4172
03:03:16.242 --> 03:03:19.165
You try and look to the right or left,

4173
03:03:19.165 --> 03:03:22.581
but you are locked in on this singular slitted pupil,

4174
03:03:22.581 --> 03:03:25.581
your body seemingly frozen in place.

4175
03:03:27.549 --> 03:03:29.828
You're unable to to turn away.

4176
03:03:29.828 --> 03:03:33.349
The panic begins to build and the voice says,

4177
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:36.282
"Release."

4178
03:03:40.401 --> 03:03:42.843
(cracking)

4179
03:03:42.843 --> 03:03:46.313
This heavy resonant tearing sound

4180
03:03:46.313 --> 03:03:49.230
begins to fill the space around you

4181
03:03:50.349 --> 03:03:55.349
as tendrils begin to emerge from the pupil of the giant eye.

4182
03:03:58.130 --> 03:04:00.789
Snaking vines pushing through it,

4183
03:04:00.789 --> 03:04:04.148
pulling the eye apart from the center,

4184
03:04:04.148 --> 03:04:09.148
an emerald light pouring through the gaping hole.

4185
03:04:11.081 --> 03:04:13.581
Warming the waters around you.

4186
03:04:14.449 --> 03:04:16.433
A slew of emotions fill your mind.

4187
03:04:16.433 --> 03:04:20.889
Warm, amorphous, but comforting

4188
03:04:20.889 --> 03:04:23.889
and evoking ideas that become words.

4189
03:04:25.045 --> 03:04:26.970
"Come with me, child."

4190
03:04:29.709 --> 03:04:31.808
The hole within the eye glows with verdant light

4191
03:04:31.808 --> 03:04:33.558
like an open doorway.

4192
03:04:37.825 --> 03:04:41.075
TRAVIS: Do I recognize the voice?

4193
03:04:41.930 --> 03:04:44.562
MATT: You've never heard this voice.

4194
03:04:44.562 --> 03:04:45.645
SAM: What...?

4195
03:04:45.645 --> 03:04:47.037
LAURA: (whispering) Go, go, go!

4196
03:04:47.037 --> 03:04:48.704
TRAVIS: I move towards it.

4197
03:04:50.005 --> 03:04:52.405
MATT: You take a moment to push past

4198
03:04:52.405 --> 03:04:54.909
and try and swim forward and the current

4199
03:04:54.909 --> 03:04:57.461
is pushing against you.

4200
03:04:57.461 --> 03:04:59.397
Go ahead and make,

4201
03:04:59.397 --> 03:05:02.232
make a strength check for me.

4202
03:05:02.232 --> 03:05:03.265
MARISHA: (laughs)

4203
03:05:03.265 --> 03:05:04.865
TRAVIS: Which one's it going to be?

4204
03:05:04.865 --> 03:05:06.781
Strength, strength check?

4205
03:05:06.781 --> 03:05:09.373
MATT: Yeah, or athletics, I'd say.

4206
03:05:11.694 --> 03:05:14.062
TRAVIS: Athletics is way better, 17.

4207
03:05:14.062 --> 03:05:15.303
MATT: 17.

4208
03:05:16.758 --> 03:05:18.698
The current begins to build and try

4209
03:05:18.698 --> 03:05:20.274
and force you away from it.

4210
03:05:20.274 --> 03:05:23.766
The eye, you can see the veins, the corner of it tensing.

4211
03:05:23.766 --> 03:05:28.054
It's trying to resist this shifting doorway

4212
03:05:28.054 --> 03:05:31.626
and you push forward grabbing onto the vines

4213
03:05:31.626 --> 03:05:35.876
and thrust your whole body through this open wound.

4214
03:05:37.014 --> 03:05:38.681
As you push through,

4215
03:05:40.266 --> 03:05:41.516
the cold fades.

4216
03:05:42.818 --> 03:05:44.874
The vines begin to tug at your arms

4217
03:05:44.874 --> 03:05:47.164
and carry you the rest of the way through

4218
03:05:47.164 --> 03:05:50.272
as it closes behind you.

4219
03:05:52.324 --> 03:05:54.954
Without force or pain,

4220
03:05:54.954 --> 03:05:58.298
warm, cradling sensations

4221
03:05:58.298 --> 03:06:02.615
as you're removed from the nightmare of Uk'otoa.

4222
03:06:02.615 --> 03:06:07.615
Settled within a small chamber of tangled leaves and roots,

4223
03:06:07.926 --> 03:06:10.266
within this mass of vines and green,

4224
03:06:10.266 --> 03:06:12.426
you swear you can see a face.

4225
03:06:12.426 --> 03:06:13.259
Female.

4226
03:06:14.182 --> 03:06:15.562
Motherly.

4227
03:06:15.562 --> 03:06:16.806
Her eyes closed.

4228
03:06:16.806 --> 03:06:21.806
The thoughts and emotions enter your mind once more.

4229
03:06:21.834 --> 03:06:24.667
The words come to you interpreting.

4230
03:06:26.342 --> 03:06:31.342
"The womb I grant, but withers without faith.

4231
03:06:31.758 --> 03:06:35.193
"His will shall find you again soon."

4232
03:06:35.193 --> 03:06:39.498
The eyes open and light like an orange sunset

4233
03:06:39.498 --> 03:06:43.250
pour over you, through you,

4234
03:06:43.250 --> 03:06:46.202
lulling you slowly back to sleep.

4235
03:06:46.202 --> 03:06:49.531
"His will shall find you again,

4236
03:06:49.531 --> 03:06:52.898
"but until it does, rest,"

4237
03:06:56.554 --> 03:07:01.471
and the darkness takes you for the remainder of your sleep.

4238
03:07:02.314 --> 03:07:04.195
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's cool.

4239
03:07:04.195 --> 03:07:06.778
SAM: What happened, what was that?

4240
03:07:08.662 --> 03:07:10.995
MATT: Who's taking second watch?

4241
03:07:13.414 --> 03:07:14.539
LAURA: I'll take second watch.

4242
03:07:14.539 --> 03:07:16.606
MATT: Okay, Jester's up.

4243
03:07:16.606 --> 03:07:20.182
All right, Jester is sitting there quietly amongst herself.

4244
03:07:20.182 --> 03:07:24.050
It's not too cold; the dome is temperature controlled.

4245
03:07:24.050 --> 03:07:26.633
But you sit alone for a bit and

4246
03:07:27.874 --> 03:07:31.446
notice now the grass slowly growing up through the ground,

4247
03:07:31.446 --> 03:07:33.875
it's a bit strange.
LAURA: Oh, it worked.

4248
03:07:33.875 --> 03:07:36.125
I brought you back, buddies.

4249
03:07:37.568 --> 03:07:38.959
MATT: All it takes is a little elbow grease

4250
03:07:38.959 --> 03:07:40.745
and some Jester spittle, apparently.

4251
03:07:40.745 --> 03:07:41.587
LAURA: That's right.

4252
03:07:41.587 --> 03:07:44.508
Some love, that's all you need.

4253
03:07:44.508 --> 03:07:45.452
MATT: Make a perception check for me,

4254
03:07:45.452 --> 03:07:47.972
while you're on your watch.

4255
03:07:47.972 --> 03:07:48.805
LAURA: Ooh!

4256
03:07:51.151 --> 03:07:53.537
23.

4257
03:07:53.537 --> 03:07:55.187
MATT: Nice.

4258
03:07:56.386 --> 03:07:59.336
Looking up at the sky, you see

4259
03:08:00.421 --> 03:08:03.153
something moving through the clouds.

4260
03:08:03.153 --> 03:08:07.378
Some shape drift through and it's gone.

4261
03:08:09.049 --> 03:08:12.632
You see it again, a little further away.

4262
03:08:14.629 --> 03:08:18.601
Then pouring out of the storm atop

4263
03:08:18.601 --> 03:08:22.168
you see a bird, more massive--

4264
03:08:23.209 --> 03:08:26.313
well, as massive as one you've seen before--

4265
03:08:26.313 --> 03:08:30.338
go into a full dive. For a moment,

4266
03:08:30.338 --> 03:08:32.837
you're about to yell to wake up your friends,

4267
03:08:32.837 --> 03:08:34.669
but the dive is quite a ways away

4268
03:08:34.669 --> 03:08:36.857
and it's arcing in a different direction.

4269
03:08:36.857 --> 03:08:39.108
You watch it scrape across the ground

4270
03:08:39.108 --> 03:08:42.121
and lift up and you see,

4271
03:08:42.121 --> 03:08:45.093
no real definite shape with the movement and shift,

4272
03:08:45.093 --> 03:08:47.251
but something is now grasped in its claws.

4273
03:08:47.251 --> 03:08:49.606
Something large that is now being held

4274
03:08:49.606 --> 03:08:52.273
and lifted off as the giant bird

4275
03:08:54.181 --> 03:08:57.014
disappears into the mist and rain.

4276
03:08:58.985 --> 03:09:02.437
LAURA: Did it seem like it was anything close to us

4277
03:09:02.437 --> 03:09:04.724
that it snatched up?

4278
03:09:04.724 --> 03:09:07.545
MARISHA: Was is one of our moorbounders?
LAURA: Yeah.

4279
03:09:07.545 --> 03:09:10.043
MATT: Maybe about 150 feet from you.

4280
03:09:10.043 --> 03:09:11.568
MARISHA: Ooh!
LIAM: That's close.

4281
03:09:12.821 --> 03:09:14.654
Just like the mist!
MARISHA: Ooh!

4282
03:09:19.689 --> 03:09:22.100
LAURA: This place is creepy!

4283
03:09:22.100 --> 03:09:23.416
TRAVIS: We're about to be sans a moorbounder.

4284
03:09:23.416 --> 03:09:25.057
MARISHA: I think we are!

4285
03:09:26.313 --> 03:09:27.273
MATT: Is there anything else you'd like to do

4286
03:09:27.273 --> 03:09:28.489
during your watch?

4287
03:09:28.489 --> 03:09:29.793
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to send a message.

4288
03:09:29.793 --> 03:09:31.936
MATT: All right.

4289
03:09:31.936 --> 03:09:33.752
LAURA: To...

4290
03:09:37.369 --> 03:09:39.155
Kiri.

4291
03:09:39.155 --> 03:09:40.771
SAM: Kiri.

4292
03:09:41.869 --> 03:09:43.685
TRAVIS: To Kiri?
LAURA: Mm-hmm!

4293
03:09:47.398 --> 03:09:48.315
Hi, Kiri!

4294
03:09:50.236 --> 03:09:52.486
I'm just thinking about you

4295
03:09:53.366 --> 03:09:56.865
in front of this really big tree and it's pretty cool

4296
03:09:56.865 --> 03:09:59.198
and I wish you could see it.

4297
03:10:00.241 --> 03:10:01.741
I miss you! I hope--

4298
03:10:07.849 --> 03:10:09.274
MATT: (like Jester) "Jester!
LAURA: (gasps)

4299
03:10:10.317 --> 03:10:11.926
MATT: "I miss you.

4300
03:10:16.557 --> 03:10:18.140
"Come eat your food.

4301
03:10:22.555 --> 03:10:24.088
"Where were you?

4302
03:10:27.467 --> 03:10:28.767
"I miss you.

4303
03:10:30.499 --> 03:10:32.606
"I miss you."

4304
03:10:32.606 --> 03:10:34.159
And she finishes out repeating that phrase

4305
03:10:34.159 --> 03:10:34.992
over and over again.

4306
03:10:34.992 --> 03:10:36.034
TRAVIS: (like Kiri) Go kill yourself.

4307
03:10:41.599 --> 03:10:43.531
LAURA: Okay, I go to sleep.

4308
03:10:43.531 --> 03:10:44.364
MATT: Okay.

4309
03:10:45.787 --> 03:10:47.116
Third and final watch. Who's taking that?

4310
03:10:47.116 --> 03:10:47.949
MARISHA: Yasha.

4311
03:10:47.949 --> 03:10:49.063
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll take it, yeah.

4312
03:10:49.063 --> 03:10:50.837
MATT: Yasha and Caduceus.
MARISHA: I'll take it with Yasha.

4313
03:10:50.837 --> 03:10:52.428
MATT: Oh, okay.

4314
03:10:53.711 --> 03:10:55.423
Caduceus takes a 12 hour super nap.

4315
03:10:55.423 --> 03:10:57.911
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I'm in. I'm waiting for more.

4316
03:10:57.911 --> 03:10:59.556
MATT: As is Fjord, I guess.

4317
03:10:59.556 --> 03:11:03.547
All right, so you guys are on final watch.

4318
03:11:03.547 --> 03:11:05.138
ASHLEY: Wow.

4319
03:11:06.895 --> 03:11:08.478
Look, there's grass.

4320
03:11:10.866 --> 03:11:12.863
MARISHA: That's weird.

4321
03:11:12.863 --> 03:11:16.623
ASHLEY: Maybe Jester did heal the grass.

4322
03:11:16.623 --> 03:11:19.235
MARISHA: She does have a radiating glow

4323
03:11:19.235 --> 03:11:21.363
wherever she goes, so

4324
03:11:21.363 --> 03:11:24.351
maybe it was healed by her presence

4325
03:11:24.351 --> 03:11:25.743
and fuck Caduceus, right?

4326
03:11:25.743 --> 03:11:27.168
He had nothing to do with it.

4327
03:11:27.168 --> 03:11:28.593
ASHLEY: Well yeah, probably.

4328
03:11:28.593 --> 03:11:32.178
He had nothing to do with it at all.

4329
03:11:32.178 --> 03:11:33.011
MARISHA: Hey,

4330
03:11:34.219 --> 03:11:37.302
we haven't really talked much since I

4331
03:11:38.391 --> 03:11:41.852
heard all that fucked up shit that happened to you.

4332
03:11:41.852 --> 03:11:43.535
I'm sorry.

4333
03:11:43.535 --> 03:11:46.285
ASHLEY: Oh, that's okay. Thank you, Beau.

4334
03:11:47.271 --> 03:11:48.521
MARISHA: You know it's--

4335
03:11:50.599 --> 03:11:53.349
it's no real point of comparison,

4336
03:11:54.259 --> 03:11:55.542
but

4337
03:11:57.963 --> 03:12:02.963
I was forced to leave behind the first

4338
03:12:03.183 --> 03:12:05.949
real person I loved as well.

4339
03:12:06.935 --> 03:12:07.768
So--

4340
03:12:09.302 --> 03:12:10.135
ASHLEY: You did?

4341
03:12:11.811 --> 03:12:12.644
MARISHA: Yeah.

4342
03:12:14.100 --> 03:12:15.783
Her name was Tori.

4343
03:12:20.899 --> 03:12:22.791
She was a little bit older than me, you know?

4344
03:12:22.791 --> 03:12:23.631
So it's like--

4345
03:12:23.631 --> 03:12:25.191
ASHLEY: Oh, you like the older ones, yeah?

4346
03:12:25.191 --> 03:12:27.676
MARISHA: She kind of showed me the ropes.

4347
03:12:27.676 --> 03:12:28.843
She was great.

4348
03:12:30.214 --> 03:12:33.131
She was my literal partner in crime

4349
03:12:34.249 --> 03:12:35.666
for a little bit.

4350
03:12:37.203 --> 03:12:39.786
And also who I got busted with.

4351
03:12:40.775 --> 03:12:45.400
So we were both arrested together and

4352
03:12:46.399 --> 03:12:47.959
the next morning my dad was there

4353
03:12:47.959 --> 03:12:50.571
and busted me out of jail,

4354
03:12:50.571 --> 03:12:55.554
paid bail, and I think made some sort of arrangements

4355
03:12:56.615 --> 03:12:57.948
with the guards.

4356
03:12:59.688 --> 03:13:03.438
I don't know. Who knows what happened to her.

4357
03:13:05.059 --> 03:13:07.142
I don't think she's dead.

4358
03:13:08.583 --> 03:13:10.833
She was one tough bitch, so.

4359
03:13:13.235 --> 03:13:16.918
But I'm sure she hates me for forever,

4360
03:13:18.859 --> 03:13:20.192
wherever she is.

4361
03:13:21.723 --> 03:13:23.390
But anyway, it's not,

4362
03:13:25.071 --> 03:13:28.655
it's not anywhere close to what you experienced, but

4363
03:13:28.655 --> 03:13:30.072
I got some little

4364
03:13:31.233 --> 03:13:34.724
shred of understanding, I guess.

4365
03:13:34.724 --> 03:13:37.515
ASHLEY: Yeah, you know,

4366
03:13:39.711 --> 03:13:42.128
leaving a loved one behind is

4367
03:13:43.783 --> 03:13:45.166
still a--

4368
03:13:47.103 --> 03:13:50.703
it's a shitty feeling across the board.

4369
03:13:50.703 --> 03:13:54.259
Did you ever think about looking her up again?

4370
03:13:54.259 --> 03:13:55.908
MARISHA: No.

4371
03:13:55.908 --> 03:13:56.741
No.

4372
03:13:58.415 --> 03:14:00.499
Because I'm pretty sure she would

4373
03:14:00.499 --> 03:14:02.631
punch me in the face

4374
03:14:02.631 --> 03:14:04.106
upon sight.

4375
03:14:06.063 --> 03:14:09.230
ASHLEY: I'm sure she doesn't hate you, Beau.

4376
03:14:14.615 --> 03:14:15.617
MARISHA: What about you?

4377
03:14:15.617 --> 03:14:19.532
You ever feel like looking up old blast from the pasts?

4378
03:14:19.532 --> 03:14:22.115
Guess you don't really

4379
03:14:22.115 --> 03:14:24.723
remember too many of them.

4380
03:14:24.723 --> 03:14:25.556
ASHLEY: I mean,

4381
03:14:31.683 --> 03:14:35.523
Zuala was the only person that I've ever been with.

4382
03:14:35.523 --> 03:14:36.356
So,

4383
03:14:38.100 --> 03:14:43.100
I could go look for her and dig her up somewhere, I guess.

4384
03:14:43.955 --> 03:14:45.243
That would be weird.

4385
03:14:45.243 --> 03:14:47.871
MARISHA: Don't tell Caduceus that.

4386
03:14:47.871 --> 03:14:49.311
because he'll take you up on it.

4387
03:14:49.311 --> 03:14:51.894
ASHLEY: I sometimes think about that.

4388
03:14:54.588 --> 03:14:56.672
But I-- it's,

4389
03:14:59.059 --> 03:15:00.726
it's in the past, so.

4390
03:15:02.151 --> 03:15:03.303
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel you.

4391
03:15:03.303 --> 03:15:07.743
ASHLEY: I know, as they say you have to move on or whatever,

4392
03:15:07.743 --> 03:15:11.103
but that doesn't make it any easier.

4393
03:15:11.103 --> 03:15:11.936
MARISHA: No.

4394
03:15:14.523 --> 03:15:16.911
There's something about you.

4395
03:15:16.911 --> 03:15:17.744
Kind of

4396
03:15:20.283 --> 03:15:23.033
excited to see what it is. Because

4397
03:15:25.203 --> 03:15:28.055
first there was that Trent guy,

4398
03:15:28.055 --> 03:15:30.230
now this Obann guy,

4399
03:15:31.202 --> 03:15:34.835
even Molly. Seems like you have

4400
03:15:34.835 --> 03:15:38.929
gravitational force around you

4401
03:15:38.929 --> 03:15:40.610
for better or for worse.

4402
03:15:40.610 --> 03:15:43.791
ASHLEY: Jester thinks that maybe I was a

4403
03:15:43.791 --> 03:15:46.592
a really like super good harp player.

4404
03:15:46.592 --> 03:15:48.231
MARISHA: Oh.

4405
03:15:48.231 --> 03:15:49.203
Wow.

4406
03:15:49.203 --> 03:15:54.031
ASHLEY: I'm sticking to the hope that maybe I was just like

4407
03:15:54.031 --> 03:15:55.815
traveling around just like

4408
03:15:55.815 --> 03:15:59.099
playing like a rock harp or something.

4409
03:15:59.099 --> 03:16:02.627
MARISHA: Rock harp, yeah, no, that's metal.

4410
03:16:02.627 --> 03:16:04.979
ASHLEY: Yeah, real, like a

4411
03:16:04.979 --> 03:16:07.729
yeah, like a metal harp, you know.

4412
03:16:09.527 --> 03:16:12.777
I doubt that's the case, but we'll see.

4413
03:16:13.635 --> 03:16:18.635
But thank you for not judging me, Beau.

4414
03:16:19.888 --> 03:16:22.731
MARISHA: Oh, have you seen me?

4415
03:16:22.731 --> 03:16:24.659
Who am I to fucking judge?

4416
03:16:24.659 --> 03:16:25.992
ASHLEY: I've seen you.

4417
03:16:27.331 --> 03:16:28.998
I've seen you a lot.

4418
03:16:29.939 --> 03:16:31.422
LAURA: (tongue clicking)

4419
03:16:33.149 --> 03:16:34.274
MARISHA: All right, let's get some sleep.

4420
03:16:34.274 --> 03:16:35.532
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm pretty tired.

4421
03:16:35.532 --> 03:16:37.813
MARISHA: Me, too.

4422
03:16:37.813 --> 03:16:40.063
ASHLEY: Good night.
MARISHA: Good night.

4423
03:16:41.189 --> 03:16:44.106
MATT: As the morning light over Xhorhas

4424
03:16:44.942 --> 03:16:48.494
begins to bring the dawn through the storm,

4425
03:16:48.494 --> 03:16:52.950
the rains continue, but the day is yours

4426
03:16:52.950 --> 03:16:55.590
as you all collectively come back to consciousness

4427
03:16:55.590 --> 03:16:57.090
at your own times.

4428
03:16:58.994 --> 03:17:01.874
The ground around you is green,

4429
03:17:01.874 --> 03:17:03.602
in and outside the dome.

4430
03:17:03.602 --> 03:17:04.435
TALIESIN: How far?

4431
03:17:05.370 --> 03:17:08.412
MATT: About 30 or so feet past the dome

4432
03:17:08.412 --> 03:17:10.966
around the tree entirely.

4433
03:17:10.966 --> 03:17:13.382
MARISHA: Maybe it's just been a bit since it's rained.

4434
03:17:13.382 --> 03:17:16.290
TALIESIN: Could have just needed a little bit of rain, yeah.

4435
03:17:16.290 --> 03:17:18.239
ASHLEY: Could all that have happened overnight?

4436
03:17:18.239 --> 03:17:19.382
That seems so fast.

4437
03:17:19.382 --> 03:17:22.290
LAURA: The tree is not a vampire tree,

4438
03:17:22.290 --> 03:17:23.436
maybe it's a healing tree.

4439
03:17:23.436 --> 03:17:24.511
LIAM: Maybe it's a giving tree.

4440
03:17:24.511 --> 03:17:25.344
LAURA: Yeah.

4441
03:17:26.606 --> 03:17:28.714
SAM: You guys, I had the craziest,

4442
03:17:28.714 --> 03:17:31.819
most intense visceral dream.

4443
03:17:31.819 --> 03:17:32.902
LAURA: About what?

4444
03:17:35.167 --> 03:17:38.484
SAM: It was so crazy. I lo--

4445
03:17:38.484 --> 03:17:40.814
(screaming)

4446
03:17:44.546 --> 03:17:45.612
LIAM: Go on.

4447
03:17:45.612 --> 03:17:49.467
SAM: I can't clean it off because of make up.

4448
03:17:49.467 --> 03:17:52.288
ASHLEY: You have to keep it on.

4449
03:17:52.288 --> 03:17:54.538
(laughter)

4450
03:17:56.358 --> 03:17:57.525
LIAM: Point blank.

4451
03:17:59.393 --> 03:18:00.985
MATT: Continue, Nott.

4452
03:18:00.985 --> 03:18:05.652
SAM: I don't remember what it was, but it seemed important.

4453
03:18:07.190 --> 03:18:09.625
Anyone else have any dreams?

4454
03:18:09.625 --> 03:18:11.485
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

4455
03:18:11.485 --> 03:18:13.318
SAM: All right, let's go.

4456
03:18:15.413 --> 03:18:17.425
TRAVIS: Anybody see anything during the night?

4457
03:18:17.425 --> 03:18:19.913
LAURA: Oh yeah, I saw one of those giant bird things again.

4458
03:18:19.913 --> 03:18:22.553
What is called, like a roc or something, right?

4459
03:18:22.553 --> 03:18:23.677
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's right.

4460
03:18:23.677 --> 03:18:25.945
LAURA: Yeah, huge wing span,

4461
03:18:25.945 --> 03:18:28.116
it came down. Oh, and it grabbed something!

4462
03:18:28.116 --> 03:18:30.481
I hope it wasn't Yarnball!

4463
03:18:30.481 --> 03:18:31.455
ASHLEY: Should we go check?

4464
03:18:31.455 --> 03:18:33.372
SAM: Yes, go check.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4465
03:18:34.411 --> 03:18:36.391
See how many steeds we got left.

4466
03:18:36.391 --> 03:18:37.875
LAURA: As I peek my head out I keep

4467
03:18:37.875 --> 03:18:40.290
an eye out for the giant bird.

4468
03:18:40.290 --> 03:18:41.510
LIAM: This stuff smells great.

4469
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:42.710
SAM: Oh man, I think I got the

4470
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:43.793
cheap stuff.
MATT: The dome has faded, by the way.

4471
03:18:43.793 --> 03:18:45.784
It's an eight hour dome.

4472
03:18:48.583 --> 03:18:50.000
TALIESIN: The giant bird.

4473
03:18:51.823 --> 03:18:53.655
There's a giant bird.
LAURA: What about it?

4474
03:18:53.655 --> 03:18:55.392
TALIESIN: There's a giant tree.

4475
03:18:55.392 --> 03:18:57.479
LAURA: Yeah, they could be living in the giant tree.

4476
03:18:57.479 --> 03:18:59.336
TALIESIN: With like a nest.

4477
03:18:59.336 --> 03:19:00.703
TRAVIS: 500 feet up.

4478
03:19:00.703 --> 03:19:02.517
TALIESIN: Let's tread carefully.

4479
03:19:02.517 --> 03:19:03.350
LAURA: Okay.

4480
03:19:05.143 --> 03:19:07.859
SAM: Should I go do a once around the tree

4481
03:19:07.859 --> 03:19:10.226
to see if there's anything we might have missed?

4482
03:19:10.226 --> 03:19:12.206
MARISHA: We'll go check in on our moorbounders first.

4483
03:19:12.206 --> 03:19:13.423
LAURA: Yeah, our moorbounders to make sure

4484
03:19:13.423 --> 03:19:14.879
they didn't get eaten.

4485
03:19:14.879 --> 03:19:15.907
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep an eye on the sky

4486
03:19:15.907 --> 03:19:17.067
now that I'm thinking about that.

4487
03:19:17.067 --> 03:19:17.900
MATT: Okay.

4488
03:19:19.155 --> 03:19:21.643
TRAVIS: Can you quietly call for him?

4489
03:19:21.643 --> 03:19:23.279
LIAM: I'm going to send
LAURA: (whispering) Yarnball!

4490
03:19:23.279 --> 03:19:26.306
LIAM: my vulture on a lazy circle up and around

4491
03:19:26.306 --> 03:19:28.165
to check out the upper reaches of the tree.

4492
03:19:28.165 --> 03:19:31.915
MATT: Okay, make a perception check for Frumpkin.

4493
03:19:34.723 --> 03:19:36.959
LIAM: Come on, Frumpkin, nine.

4494
03:19:36.959 --> 03:19:38.634
MATT: Nine.
SAM: Nine!

4495
03:19:40.275 --> 03:19:42.359
MATT: Frumpkin takes a while to do a full pass

4496
03:19:42.359 --> 03:19:43.423
while you guys are gathering your things

4497
03:19:43.423 --> 03:19:45.495
and looking out for your moorbounders.

4498
03:19:45.495 --> 03:19:49.920
There are a number of vultures

4499
03:19:49.920 --> 03:19:52.694
and other creatures that live in the high up

4500
03:19:52.694 --> 03:19:57.369
boughs of the Arbor Exemplar.

4501
03:19:58.919 --> 03:20:03.087
But hard to see past the exterior of the canopy

4502
03:20:03.087 --> 03:20:05.680
especially with the rain.

4503
03:20:05.680 --> 03:20:08.099
TALIESIN: Maybe once we get the moorbounders

4504
03:20:08.099 --> 03:20:10.063
and get some cover from the rain

4505
03:20:10.063 --> 03:20:12.063
perhaps that might help.

4506
03:20:15.498 --> 03:20:17.335
MATT: But do you look for your moorbounders?

4507
03:20:17.335 --> 03:20:18.202
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

4508
03:20:18.202 --> 03:20:19.435
MATT: All right make perception check for me.

4509
03:20:19.435 --> 03:20:21.699
TALIESIN: Okay, this is probably going to be.

4510
03:20:21.699 --> 03:20:24.323
ASHLEY: They're fine, they're fine, they're fine.

4511
03:20:24.323 --> 03:20:26.559
LAURA: It was not intentional, it was an unintentional 20.

4512
03:20:26.559 --> 03:20:27.427
SAM: Oh no, it was?

4513
03:20:27.427 --> 03:20:28.260
LAURA: Yeah.

4514
03:20:28.260 --> 03:20:30.547
TALIESIN: Well, you still did good, 11.

4515
03:20:30.547 --> 03:20:31.795
LAURA: Investigation or perception?

4516
03:20:31.795 --> 03:20:33.247
MATT: Perception.
LAURA: Ten.

4517
03:20:33.247 --> 03:20:34.080
MATT: Ten?

4518
03:20:35.707 --> 03:20:38.374
You don't see your moorbounders.

4519
03:20:39.639 --> 03:20:41.972
TRAVIS: (whistling)

4520
03:20:43.205 --> 03:20:44.122
LAURA: Yarnball.

4521
03:20:46.195 --> 03:20:48.112
ASHLEY: Can you talk to them?

4522
03:20:49.531 --> 03:20:51.976
TALIESIN: I mean, if they can hear.

4523
03:20:51.976 --> 03:20:53.235
LAURA: I don't think they can.

4524
03:20:53.235 --> 03:20:56.295
SAM: I'll climb up the tree and see if I can get a look.

4525
03:20:56.295 --> 03:20:59.283
LAURA: No, let me see, it has to be a humanoid, I think.

4526
03:20:59.283 --> 03:21:01.035
A creature you are familiar with!

4527
03:21:01.035 --> 03:21:03.375
Okay, I'm going to send a message to Yarnball.

4528
03:21:03.375 --> 03:21:04.208
MATT: Okay.

4529
03:21:05.535 --> 03:21:10.035
LAURA: Yarnball, we're out of the dome, come back to Mama.

4530
03:21:11.286 --> 03:21:13.220
We're waiting on you.

4531
03:21:13.220 --> 03:21:15.595
SAM and LAURA: (clicking)

4532
03:21:18.544 --> 03:21:21.124
You're super cute, I've got food for you.

4533
03:21:21.124 --> 03:21:23.791
That was a lie, I don't have any.

4534
03:21:24.964 --> 03:21:26.944
TALIESIN: Can you tell if the person

4535
03:21:26.944 --> 03:21:30.561
you're trying to send a message to is unavailable?

4536
03:21:30.561 --> 03:21:31.394
TRAVIS: Hmm!

4537
03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:44.467
MATT: (moorbounder croaking and grunting)

4538
03:21:46.596 --> 03:21:48.263
It can respond.

4539
03:21:49.508 --> 03:21:50.617
LAURA: I think he heard me.

4540
03:21:50.617 --> 03:21:51.620
TALIESIN: Okay.

4541
03:21:51.620 --> 03:21:52.758
SAM: He's alive?

4542
03:21:52.758 --> 03:21:56.616
LAURA: Yeah, he didn't sound hurt in his mental message?

4543
03:21:56.616 --> 03:21:58.392
MATT: Didn't seem to be.

4544
03:21:58.392 --> 03:22:00.248
A few moments pass and you can see

4545
03:22:00.248 --> 03:22:04.640
the three moorbounders had holed up at the tree's base.

4546
03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:06.074
TALIESIN: All right.

4547
03:22:06.074 --> 03:22:06.907
Let's go over.

4548
03:22:08.632 --> 03:22:10.097
SAM: I'm going to do a once around the tree,

4549
03:22:10.097 --> 03:22:11.884
does anyone want to join me?
TRAVIS: I'll go with you, yeah.

4550
03:22:11.884 --> 03:22:13.125
SAM: Let's go once around the tree.

4551
03:22:13.125 --> 03:22:14.704
MARISHA: We all go together.

4552
03:22:14.704 --> 03:22:16.924
MATT: Okay, so you all get up on your moorbounders

4553
03:22:16.924 --> 03:22:19.501
and do an arc around the tree,

4554
03:22:19.501 --> 03:22:21.292
carefully, stealthily, or just a regular.

4555
03:22:21.292 --> 03:22:22.864
ALL: Stealthily.

4556
03:22:22.864 --> 03:22:24.121
MATT: All right, so a slow pace,

4557
03:22:24.121 --> 03:22:26.076
everyone make a stealth check, please.

4558
03:22:26.076 --> 03:22:28.838
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

4559
03:22:28.838 --> 03:22:31.634
TALIESIN: Plus ten?
LAURA: Yeah.

4560
03:22:31.634 --> 03:22:34.392
TALIESIN: Hey, now that's pretty good.

4561
03:22:36.844 --> 03:22:39.556
MATT: Moorbounders didn't roll all that great,

4562
03:22:39.556 --> 03:22:41.868
but the Pass Without a Trace definitely helped.

4563
03:22:41.868 --> 03:22:42.964
Okay, so.

4564
03:22:42.964 --> 03:22:43.797
TRAVIS: 28.

4565
03:22:43.797 --> 03:22:44.630
MARISHA: 38.

4566
03:22:46.246 --> 03:22:47.079
LIAM: 23.

4567
03:22:47.079 --> 03:22:48.570
SAM: 42.

4568
03:22:48.570 --> 03:22:49.630
LAURA: 21.

4569
03:22:49.630 --> 03:22:50.786
TALIESIN: 26.

4570
03:22:50.786 --> 03:22:53.440
ASHLEY: 15.

4571
03:22:53.440 --> 03:22:55.555
MATT: You guys all certainly made up for the moorbounders.

4572
03:22:55.555 --> 03:22:57.251
Yeah, all right.

4573
03:22:57.251 --> 03:22:59.228
So you carefully make your way through.

4574
03:22:59.228 --> 03:23:03.415
The little bit of green grass that you saw, Nott,

4575
03:23:03.415 --> 03:23:06.055
around like about the ten or so feet

4576
03:23:06.055 --> 03:23:08.139
outside of the tree's edge,

4577
03:23:08.139 --> 03:23:10.722
is now a very tall green grass.

4578
03:23:12.895 --> 03:23:14.693
As you're making your arc around it,

4579
03:23:14.693 --> 03:23:16.283
as the grass gets higher, the moorbounders are

4580
03:23:16.283 --> 03:23:18.383
pushing through and you can just see past the shoulders.

4581
03:23:18.383 --> 03:23:20.843
The landscape around the tree has changed overnight

4582
03:23:20.843 --> 03:23:23.336
in a very weird, unique way.

4583
03:23:23.336 --> 03:23:25.356
SAM: Not just under the dome, right?

4584
03:23:25.356 --> 03:23:28.283
MATT: No, the grass has expanded out

4585
03:23:28.283 --> 03:23:30.053
for about an additional 200 feet

4586
03:23:30.053 --> 03:23:32.035
from the base of the tree in all directions

4587
03:23:32.035 --> 03:23:33.323
and near the base of the tree,

4588
03:23:33.323 --> 03:23:35.259
the grass gets higher and more dense.

4589
03:23:35.259 --> 03:23:38.107
LIAM: It's all about that base.

4590
03:23:38.107 --> 03:23:40.283
TALIESIN: I'm going to let the tree and the grass know

4591
03:23:40.283 --> 03:23:43.366
that we're just taking a look around.

4592
03:23:45.175 --> 03:23:46.452
Let us know if there's anything

4593
03:23:46.452 --> 03:23:48.702
we should be worried about.

4594
03:23:49.538 --> 03:23:51.294
ASHLEY: I'm going to lean to the side of the moorbounder

4595
03:23:51.294 --> 03:23:53.516
and I'm going to pick a blade of grass.

4596
03:23:53.516 --> 03:23:55.183
MATT: Okay, you pick it.

4597
03:23:56.664 --> 03:23:58.480
It's healthy, it's fresh, it's clean.

4598
03:23:58.480 --> 03:24:02.028
ASHLEY: I'm going to fold it and put it in my book.

4599
03:24:02.028 --> 03:24:05.778
MATT: All right, you guys arc around, looking up.

4600
03:24:07.036 --> 03:24:10.500
There are all manner of, you know,

4601
03:24:10.500 --> 03:24:14.102
paths of thick bark and winding elements of the tree

4602
03:24:14.102 --> 03:24:16.995
as it's grown where

4603
03:24:16.995 --> 03:24:19.296
heavy vines dangle down

4604
03:24:19.296 --> 03:24:21.292
and tangle into parts of it.

4605
03:24:21.292 --> 03:24:25.328
It might be climbable, but a fall from there

4606
03:24:25.328 --> 03:24:26.828
would be real bad.

4607
03:24:28.532 --> 03:24:29.365
SAM: I'll do it.

4608
03:24:29.365 --> 03:24:30.198
MARISHA: I'll do it.

4609
03:24:30.198 --> 03:24:31.461
TRAVIS: I'll do it.

4610
03:24:31.461 --> 03:24:33.068
MATT: You going to climb it?

4611
03:24:33.068 --> 03:24:34.476
MARISHA: Climb the tree?

4612
03:24:34.476 --> 03:24:36.156
MATT: If you want.

4613
03:24:36.156 --> 03:24:38.301
It's 300 feet up until you hit

4614
03:24:38.301 --> 03:24:40.054
the bottom of the canopy, just so you know.

4615
03:24:40.054 --> 03:24:41.228
TRAVIS: Did you say there was a cave?

4616
03:24:41.228 --> 03:24:43.720
MARISHA: With urarmored movement, like parkouring up walls.

4617
03:24:43.720 --> 03:24:45.716
TRAVIS: Nott, did you say there was a little alcove or cave?

4618
03:24:45.716 --> 03:24:46.874
SAM: There's like a little indentation.

4619
03:24:46.874 --> 03:24:47.863
I'll show it to them.

4620
03:24:47.863 --> 03:24:48.696
TRAVIS: That's somebody lives in?

4621
03:24:48.696 --> 03:24:52.491
LIAM: Let's go look at it before we attempt that.

4622
03:24:52.491 --> 03:24:54.419
SAM: But it didn't seem like it was very.

4623
03:24:54.419 --> 03:24:55.602
TRAVIS: From the outside!

4624
03:24:55.602 --> 03:24:56.715
TALIESIN: Yeah, if there's anything else,

4625
03:24:56.715 --> 03:24:59.055
I'm just trying to look for-- maybe

4626
03:24:59.055 --> 03:25:00.659
someone carved something into the tree

4627
03:25:00.659 --> 03:25:02.054
or if there's any interesting pattern.

4628
03:25:02.054 --> 03:25:03.637
MATT: Perception check.

4629
03:25:04.877 --> 03:25:07.577
TALIESIN: Come on, let's do better than last time, shall we?

4630
03:25:07.577 --> 03:25:08.929
Or yeah, that's okay.

4631
03:25:08.929 --> 03:25:10.621
Okay, that's a 22.

4632
03:25:10.621 --> 03:25:11.538
MATT: 22, okay.

4633
03:25:12.437 --> 03:25:15.153
All right, so you guys are scanning around.

4634
03:25:15.153 --> 03:25:17.177
Who's attempting to climb it?

4635
03:25:17.177 --> 03:25:18.633
LIAM: Whoa, we're not checking out that alcove yet?

4636
03:25:18.633 --> 03:25:19.893
SAM: We're going to check out the little alcove first

4637
03:25:19.893 --> 03:25:22.997
and then I will climb with whoever wants to climb.

4638
03:25:22.997 --> 03:25:24.622
MATT: Okay, you head to the alcove.

4639
03:25:24.622 --> 03:25:25.805
You go ahead and inspect it

4640
03:25:25.805 --> 03:25:27.480
and it looks like this is probably where the moorbounders

4641
03:25:27.480 --> 03:25:31.549
had found a place to sleep for the night.

4642
03:25:31.549 --> 03:25:33.169
There is that ring of stones

4643
03:25:33.169 --> 03:25:36.413
that someone had built a small fire pit here at some point,

4644
03:25:36.413 --> 03:25:37.877
but it's been left a long time

4645
03:25:37.877 --> 03:25:39.872
and the stones have been turned a bit.

4646
03:25:39.872 --> 03:25:42.733
The grass has grown up through

4647
03:25:42.733 --> 03:25:43.953
and a lot of the ashes,

4648
03:25:43.953 --> 03:25:46.009
so it looks like a fire pit that

4649
03:25:46.009 --> 03:25:46.953
hasn't been used in a long time

4650
03:25:46.953 --> 03:25:50.120
and that nature has reclaimed.

4651
03:25:51.437 --> 03:25:53.397
But it looks like it's probably seen some use

4652
03:25:53.397 --> 03:25:54.547
here or there.

4653
03:25:54.547 --> 03:25:56.251
SAM: Just look for any hidden doors in there.

4654
03:25:56.251 --> 03:25:58.335
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make a perception check.

4655
03:25:58.335 --> 03:25:59.427
Let's do investigation, sorry, investigation.

4656
03:25:59.427 --> 03:26:01.795
SAM: Okay, not great 16.

4657
03:26:01.795 --> 03:26:04.675
MATT: You go ahead and maneuver yourself through,

4658
03:26:04.675 --> 03:26:08.604
feeling for any panels or doorways or anything.

4659
03:26:08.604 --> 03:26:10.253
Nothing catches your attention.

4660
03:26:10.253 --> 03:26:12.011
SAM: Oh, let's climb.

4661
03:26:12.011 --> 03:26:12.844
TALIESIN: I'm going to run Detect Magic

4662
03:26:12.844 --> 03:26:14.418
just for fun for a minute.

4663
03:26:14.418 --> 03:26:16.899
MATT: Okay, Detect Magic.

4664
03:26:16.899 --> 03:26:20.319
The entire tree gives off a very strong

4665
03:26:20.319 --> 03:26:23.469
magical divine essence.

4666
03:26:26.359 --> 03:26:29.146
Who's climbing?
SAM: I'm climbing!

4667
03:26:29.146 --> 03:26:30.979
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Is that us three?

4668
03:26:32.011 --> 03:26:33.707
SAM: I take a big drink and let's go.

4669
03:26:33.707 --> 03:26:35.791
MARISHA: So yeah, at 9th-level, I can move up

4670
03:26:35.791 --> 03:26:38.985
vertical surfaces without falling.

4671
03:26:38.985 --> 03:26:40.152
MATT: That's true.

4672
03:26:41.071 --> 03:26:42.919
Let's see here.

4673
03:26:42.919 --> 03:26:45.645
LAURA: Climbing is good for strong people.

4674
03:26:45.645 --> 03:26:48.739
Right, strong people climb well?

4675
03:26:48.739 --> 03:26:51.511
SAM: American Ninja Warrior.

4676
03:26:51.511 --> 03:26:53.823
TRAVIS: Or people that if they fall, have a

4677
03:26:53.823 --> 03:26:55.906
good safety net.

4678
03:26:57.438 --> 03:26:59.011
MATT: Which one is this, this is called which ability?

4679
03:26:59.011 --> 03:27:00.268
MARISHA: Unarmored movement.

4680
03:27:00.268 --> 03:27:01.203
You get it at--

4681
03:27:01.203 --> 03:27:02.097
MATT: Oh, that's right.

4682
03:27:02.097 --> 03:27:03.855
MARISHA: 3rd-level, but then at 9th-level,

4683
03:27:03.855 --> 03:27:06.719
you can move across vertical surfaces and water.

4684
03:27:06.719 --> 03:27:09.075
MATT: Without falling during the move, correct.

4685
03:27:09.075 --> 03:27:10.063
MARISHA: Right.

4686
03:27:10.063 --> 03:27:13.230
MATT: So you can run up for your movement,

4687
03:27:14.500 --> 03:27:15.958
TALIESIN: As long as you get to a thing with purchase,

4688
03:27:15.958 --> 03:27:17.024
like a branch.

4689
03:27:17.024 --> 03:27:19.107
MARISHA: Yeah.

4690
03:27:19.107 --> 03:27:22.746
MATT: Yeah, well, all right. We'll see how this works.

4691
03:27:22.746 --> 03:27:25.079
TRAVIS: Some broken ass monk shit.

4692
03:27:26.257 --> 03:27:30.264
MARISHA: Do I see like a bough, a low hanging bough

4693
03:27:30.264 --> 03:27:32.844
that's roughly 40 to 45 feet up?

4694
03:27:32.844 --> 03:27:33.736
MATT: No.

4695
03:27:33.736 --> 03:27:34.748
LAURA: There's vines though?

4696
03:27:34.748 --> 03:27:35.708
MARISHA: But there's vines.

4697
03:27:35.708 --> 03:27:37.016
MATT: There are vines, like there are things

4698
03:27:37.016 --> 03:27:38.620
that you can maybe, might be able to catch yourself with.

4699
03:27:38.620 --> 03:27:39.744
MARISHA: That's what I'm going to try and do, okay.

4700
03:27:39.744 --> 03:27:41.765
MATT: So the three of you are attempting this.

4701
03:27:41.765 --> 03:27:45.160
I need you both of you to make athletics checks

4702
03:27:45.160 --> 03:27:48.836
for me, please, for the first 50 feet of climbing.

4703
03:27:48.836 --> 03:27:49.669
SAM: Eight.

4704
03:27:49.669 --> 03:27:50.502
ASHLEY: So let's just stand underneath.

4705
03:27:50.502 --> 03:27:51.912
LAURA: Me and Yasha are standing underneath them

4706
03:27:51.912 --> 03:27:53.444
trying to catch them if they fall.

4707
03:27:53.444 --> 03:27:54.840
MATT: Okay.

4708
03:27:54.840 --> 03:27:56.024
Nott gets ten feet up and then

4709
03:27:56.024 --> 03:27:59.274
immediately loses her grip and tumbles.
SAM: Fuck!

4710
03:28:00.388 --> 03:28:02.592
LAURA: That wasn't-- good job!

4711
03:28:02.592 --> 03:28:03.444
Good effort.

4712
03:28:03.444 --> 03:28:04.388
TRAVIS: 16.

4713
03:28:04.388 --> 03:28:07.488
MATT: 16, Fjord is actually, you're finding knots

4714
03:28:07.488 --> 03:28:09.892
and pulling yourself up and using some vines

4715
03:28:09.892 --> 03:28:12.248
to get along the way.

4716
03:28:12.248 --> 03:28:13.780
As you're getting part way up,

4717
03:28:13.780 --> 03:28:15.430
you're like, "I'm doing good, I'm doing good,"

4718
03:28:15.430 --> 03:28:17.371
(quick footsteps)

4719
03:28:17.371 --> 03:28:22.368
and you just see Beau sprinting up the side of the tree

4720
03:28:22.368 --> 03:28:23.896
MARISHA: Once I start running out,

4721
03:28:23.896 --> 03:28:25.592
I'm going to like try and parkour off

4722
03:28:25.592 --> 03:28:27.165
and grab some vines.

4723
03:28:27.165 --> 03:28:30.776
MATT: You grab some vines and you catch yourself there.

4724
03:28:30.776 --> 03:28:32.028
TALIESIN: I'm going to tap Resistance into you

4725
03:28:32.028 --> 03:28:33.616
before you start heading up.

4726
03:28:33.616 --> 03:28:34.449
Good luck up there.

4727
03:28:34.449 --> 03:28:35.665
LAURA: Oh, I wasn't planning on going.

4728
03:28:35.665 --> 03:28:36.498
SAM: Go on, Jessie!

4729
03:28:36.498 --> 03:28:38.252
LAURA: But I can go now that Nott fell.

4730
03:28:38.252 --> 03:28:39.453
ASHLEY: Yeah, I got this.

4731
03:28:39.453 --> 03:28:42.249
LAURA: Sure I'll try to climb, then, why not.

4732
03:28:42.249 --> 03:28:45.582
MATT: Make an athletics check for me, Jester.

4733
03:28:49.100 --> 03:28:49.933
LAURA: 20.

4734
03:28:51.172 --> 03:28:54.156
MATT: You catch up to about where Fjord is.

4735
03:28:54.156 --> 03:28:58.323
Make another athletics check, both of you guys, for--

4736
03:29:02.664 --> 03:29:04.312
LAURA: 19.
TRAVIS: 21.

4737
03:29:04.312 --> 03:29:06.048
MATT: You both are like neck and neck

4738
03:29:06.048 --> 03:29:07.792
climbing up the side here,

4739
03:29:07.792 --> 03:29:08.901
getting almost competitive

4740
03:29:08.901 --> 03:29:10.192
as you're heading up this tree.

4741
03:29:10.192 --> 03:29:11.976
You're at 100 feet up and you're still

4742
03:29:11.976 --> 03:29:14.571
200 feet from where the lowest part of the canopy is

4743
03:29:14.571 --> 03:29:15.812
and you look at each other

4744
03:29:15.812 --> 03:29:17.992
and look down and oh, you can see the tiny shapes

4745
03:29:17.992 --> 03:29:21.186
of your friends at the bottom.

4746
03:29:21.186 --> 03:29:22.764
You glance up and just see Beau

4747
03:29:22.764 --> 03:29:24.980
continue up, like grabbing vines

4748
03:29:24.980 --> 03:29:26.316
and leaping and parkouring off

4749
03:29:26.316 --> 03:29:28.552
some of this stuff going
TRAVIS: Buddy system, goddamn it.

4750
03:29:28.552 --> 03:29:30.876
MARISHA: I need momentum for this.

4751
03:29:30.876 --> 03:29:31.709
MATT: I will say as part of that,

4752
03:29:31.709 --> 03:29:33.652
make an acrobatics check for me

4753
03:29:33.652 --> 03:29:35.784
to try and utilize the vines to maintain your momentum

4754
03:29:35.784 --> 03:29:39.532
so you don't all of a sudden start plummeting.

4755
03:29:39.532 --> 03:29:40.685
MARISHA: That could have been bad, 18.

4756
03:29:40.685 --> 03:29:41.976
MATT: 18, yeah.

4757
03:29:41.976 --> 03:29:45.652
With that, you're able to find the elements of it

4758
03:29:45.652 --> 03:29:47.392
that you can leap off of and grab

4759
03:29:47.392 --> 03:29:49.206
and spin and grab the vine and swing past

4760
03:29:49.206 --> 03:29:50.736
and then use that momentum of the swing

4761
03:29:50.736 --> 03:29:53.017
to lift you up even further and keep sprinting up the side.

4762
03:29:53.017 --> 03:29:56.364
You're actually up at, you've hit 100 feet

4763
03:29:56.364 --> 03:29:58.372
while they're both at 50.

4764
03:29:58.372 --> 03:29:59.751
LAURA: I thought we were at 100 now.

4765
03:29:59.751 --> 03:30:01.432
MATT: Oh, no, that's right you guys, I'm sorry.

4766
03:30:01.432 --> 03:30:02.849
So you're at 150.

4767
03:30:05.480 --> 03:30:06.892
TALIESIN: This is scary.

4768
03:30:06.892 --> 03:30:08.512
LAURA: This is scary, this is high.

4769
03:30:08.512 --> 03:30:11.420
TALIESIN: Things could go horribly wrong now.

4770
03:30:11.420 --> 03:30:13.429
MATT: Athletics checks for both of you, please.

4771
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:15.472
LAURA: I feel like a cat that gets really high

4772
03:30:15.472 --> 03:30:17.540
like you know the squirrels that climb a palm tree

4773
03:30:17.540 --> 03:30:19.108
and it's like.

4774
03:30:19.108 --> 03:30:21.043
SAM: Keep an eye on them.

4775
03:30:21.043 --> 03:30:21.876
LAURA: (gasps)

4776
03:30:22.844 --> 03:30:24.868
I rolled a one.

4777
03:30:24.868 --> 03:30:27.181
SAM: Nothing bad can happen.
LAURA: Oh no!

4778
03:30:27.181 --> 03:30:28.514
TRAVIS: What happened?

4779
03:30:29.475 --> 03:30:33.795
MATT: So you manage to get to about 150 feet,

4780
03:30:33.795 --> 03:30:35.084
and you're starting to get tired,

4781
03:30:35.084 --> 03:30:38.204
the sweat's on the brow, but you're halfway up the tree.

4782
03:30:38.204 --> 03:30:41.296
You just hear this little (gasp)

4783
03:30:41.296 --> 03:30:42.628
and glance over at your side and you watch

4784
03:30:42.628 --> 03:30:45.556
as Jester reaches up and grabs

4785
03:30:45.556 --> 03:30:47.714
a part of the tree bark itself

4786
03:30:47.714 --> 03:30:49.708
that pulls off and breaks.

4787
03:30:49.708 --> 03:30:50.744
You reach up and grab another piece,

4788
03:30:50.744 --> 03:30:54.028
that breaks off, and she's now just going into free fall.

4789
03:30:54.028 --> 03:30:54.861
TRAVIS: I push off the tree and I go

4790
03:30:54.861 --> 03:30:56.296
into a straight dive after her.

4791
03:30:56.296 --> 03:30:58.648
MATT: What?!

4792
03:30:58.648 --> 03:31:00.104
MARISHA: It's 100 feet.

4793
03:31:00.104 --> 03:31:04.604
MATT: You see Jester just fall and the Fjord fall both just

4794
03:31:06.264 --> 03:31:09.668
80 feet, 70 feet, 60 feet, 50 feet,

4795
03:31:09.668 --> 03:31:10.720
SAM: As they approach me and Caleb both

4796
03:31:10.720 --> 03:31:14.560
do the exact same movement, and if he does it first

4797
03:31:14.560 --> 03:31:16.118
I bail.

4798
03:31:17.770 --> 03:31:21.475
MATT: Okay, so you both focusing on who?

4799
03:31:21.475 --> 03:31:23.754
LIAM: Well, I imagine we both just went,

4800
03:31:23.754 --> 03:31:26.516
both because it effects multiple people.

4801
03:31:26.516 --> 03:31:27.476
So it's overkill.

4802
03:31:27.476 --> 03:31:29.696
It's up to six people.

4803
03:31:29.696 --> 03:31:30.548
MATT: Oh, that's right, okay.

4804
03:31:30.548 --> 03:31:31.780
So then there you go.

4805
03:31:31.780 --> 03:31:34.540
So as you're diving down towards Jester,

4806
03:31:34.540 --> 03:31:36.597
Jester is trying to just plummeting back,

4807
03:31:36.597 --> 03:31:38.828
you just see Fjord rocketing in your direction

4808
03:31:38.828 --> 03:31:39.999
and right as you reach out and grab her hand,

4809
03:31:39.999 --> 03:31:43.300
you both go into a low gradual

4810
03:31:43.300 --> 03:31:45.080
Mary Poppins glide down to the base.

4811
03:31:45.080 --> 03:31:45.964
TRAVIS: Are we touching?

4812
03:31:45.964 --> 03:31:46.940
MATT: You're grabbing her hand, yeah.

4813
03:31:46.940 --> 03:31:49.336
TRAVIS: Great. I cast Thunder Step and we go

4814
03:31:49.336 --> 03:31:51.053
just straight up to the top.

4815
03:31:51.053 --> 03:31:52.161
MATT: How far does it send you?

4816
03:31:52.161 --> 03:31:53.261
TRAVIS: 90 feet.
MATT: 90 feet?

4817
03:31:53.261 --> 03:31:54.937
TRAVIS: Yeah, back up to where we were.

4818
03:31:54.937 --> 03:31:55.937
LAURA: Oh my god.

4819
03:31:57.021 --> 03:31:57.854
MATT: You Feather Fall for a second--

4820
03:31:57.854 --> 03:31:59.183
TRAVIS: Thanks for the Feather Fall.

4821
03:31:59.183 --> 03:32:02.091
MATT: And then straight up as it burst out.

4822
03:32:02.091 --> 03:32:04.327
Part of the tree where you were

4823
03:32:04.327 --> 03:32:08.199
is indented a little bit from the blast of energy around you

4824
03:32:08.199 --> 03:32:12.983
and both catch up, you're about 100 and we'll say,

4825
03:32:12.983 --> 03:32:13.880
what was that number you said?

4826
03:32:13.880 --> 03:32:15.463
TRAVIS: 90 feet.
MATT: 90 feet.

4827
03:32:15.463 --> 03:32:20.321
Yeah, you guys got back up to about, we'll say 100 feet.

4828
03:32:22.047 --> 03:32:26.953
LAURA: How long does that Feather Fall thing last, I wonder.

4829
03:32:26.953 --> 03:32:27.870
SAM: A minute.

4830
03:32:29.339 --> 03:32:32.218
But it only effects a falling creature.

4831
03:32:32.218 --> 03:32:34.303
So you're not falling anymore.

4832
03:32:34.303 --> 03:32:38.329
LIAM: They're floaty for 40, 50 or 40 seconds.

4833
03:32:38.329 --> 03:32:41.540
SAM: Because you land before the spell ends, it's over.

4834
03:32:41.540 --> 03:32:42.933
TALIESIN: But they haven't landed yet.

4835
03:32:42.933 --> 03:32:44.464
MATT: Oh, they've landed now on the tree.

4836
03:32:44.464 --> 03:32:46.812
So you're both now at 100.

4837
03:32:46.812 --> 03:32:48.267
TRAVIS: Hang on!

4838
03:32:48.267 --> 03:32:49.100
LAURA: Yeah.

4839
03:32:50.504 --> 03:32:53.499
MATT: Beau runs up to the 200-foot area.

4840
03:32:53.499 --> 03:32:56.204
MARISHA: (leaping and landing)

4841
03:32:56.204 --> 03:32:58.092
MATT: Make an acrobatics check for me.

4842
03:32:58.092 --> 03:33:00.840
SAM: American Ninja Warrior All-Star week.

4843
03:33:00.840 --> 03:33:04.516
MARISHA: That's natural 17, so 26.

4844
03:33:04.516 --> 03:33:07.352
MATT: You are just leaping off.

4845
03:33:07.352 --> 03:33:09.900
You're this like blue blur,

4846
03:33:09.900 --> 03:33:12.512
this just like blue and brown blur of Tarzan

4847
03:33:12.512 --> 03:33:14.773
up the side of the tree, just going up

4848
03:33:14.773 --> 03:33:17.132
zigzagging as you climb.

4849
03:33:17.132 --> 03:33:19.255
Both of you guys make athletics checks

4850
03:33:19.255 --> 03:33:21.338
because you need to climb.

4851
03:33:22.719 --> 03:33:23.552
TRAVIS: 17.

4852
03:33:24.507 --> 03:33:26.155
LAURA: 13.

4853
03:33:26.155 --> 03:33:29.543
MATT: 13, you're getting a little sore, Jester,

4854
03:33:29.543 --> 03:33:30.575
you're starting to slow.

4855
03:33:30.575 --> 03:33:32.315
LAURA: Well, I'm a little freaked out from falling.

4856
03:33:32.315 --> 03:33:33.148
MATT: I know.

4857
03:33:34.779 --> 03:33:36.775
LAURA: My hands are kind of sweaty.

4858
03:33:36.775 --> 03:33:38.215
MATT: You both make it up to 150,

4859
03:33:38.215 --> 03:33:40.327
but the DC is starting to climb now

4860
03:33:40.327 --> 03:33:42.907
because you're starting to get tired.

4861
03:33:42.907 --> 03:33:43.740
So now,

4862
03:33:45.383 --> 03:33:49.100
go ahead and try again, make another athletics check.

4863
03:33:49.100 --> 03:33:50.707
Beau's up at the 250 mark now.

4864
03:33:50.707 --> 03:33:52.103
LAURA: Oh my god.

4865
03:33:52.103 --> 03:33:52.936
TRAVIS: 21.

4866
03:33:54.083 --> 03:33:55.687
LAURA: Nine.

4867
03:33:55.687 --> 03:33:57.983
MATT: Nine, you don't move.

4868
03:33:57.983 --> 03:34:00.023
You try and climb it,

4869
03:34:00.023 --> 03:34:01.763
and you're just freezing in place.

4870
03:34:01.763 --> 03:34:03.727
She doesn't advance at all, but you manage

4871
03:34:03.727 --> 03:34:04.791
to get another 50 feet or so

4872
03:34:04.791 --> 03:34:05.963
so you're up to the 200 mark.

4873
03:34:05.963 --> 03:34:07.627
LAURA: I just put my forehead against the trunk.

4874
03:34:07.627 --> 03:34:09.471
TRAVIS: And the bottom of the canopy is 300?

4875
03:34:09.471 --> 03:34:11.029
MATT: Yeah.

4876
03:34:11.029 --> 03:34:12.579
She's at 150.

4877
03:34:12.579 --> 03:34:13.807
LAURA: I'm just going to stay here, Fjord,

4878
03:34:13.807 --> 03:34:15.424
you just keep going, it's okay.

4879
03:34:15.424 --> 03:34:16.790
TRAVIS: If you get up to me,

4880
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:18.506
I can help us get a little boost.

4881
03:34:18.506 --> 03:34:21.335
LAURA: I can't move. It's okay, you just keep going.

4882
03:34:22.177 --> 03:34:24.216
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

4883
03:34:24.216 --> 03:34:25.966
SAM: Like the Dawn Wall.

4884
03:34:31.688 --> 03:34:35.464
MARISHA: Nine plus eight is 17, 17.

4885
03:34:35.464 --> 03:34:37.899
MATT: Okay, with that you make it to the bottom

4886
03:34:37.899 --> 03:34:42.460
of the first branches out of the side of the tree.

4887
03:34:42.460 --> 03:34:44.336
You leap up and just, you actually watch

4888
03:34:44.336 --> 03:34:47.753
this blue blur making its way up

4889
03:34:48.744 --> 03:34:51.827
and then vanish into the green above.

4890
03:34:53.484 --> 03:34:55.280
LAURA: That was really cool.

4891
03:34:55.280 --> 03:34:56.298
MATT: Athletics check.

4892
03:34:56.298 --> 03:34:57.131
LAURA: Oh no.

4893
03:34:58.650 --> 03:34:59.778
SAM: You'll be fine.

4894
03:34:59.778 --> 03:35:01.878
MATT: Little bit of that, Caduceus' breakfast

4895
03:35:01.878 --> 03:35:02.854
crept up for a bit.

4896
03:35:02.854 --> 03:35:04.929
LAURA: Coming up in my throat.

4897
03:35:04.929 --> 03:35:07.622
TALIESIN: It's mostly tofu.

4898
03:35:07.622 --> 03:35:09.078
LAURA: Hey, 19!

4899
03:35:09.078 --> 03:35:11.598
MATT: 19, you find a second wind,

4900
03:35:11.598 --> 03:35:14.446
Fjord's words ring true

4901
03:35:14.446 --> 03:35:16.118
and start power through, like the montage music

4902
03:35:16.118 --> 03:35:17.559
starts kicking in as you just

4903
03:35:17.559 --> 03:35:20.047
one hand over the other climb your way up the tree

4904
03:35:20.047 --> 03:35:23.211
reaching Fjord. Fjord, are you waiting or can you climb?

4905
03:35:23.211 --> 03:35:24.044
TRAVIS: You want to boost?

4906
03:35:24.044 --> 03:35:24.877
LAURA: (nervous agreement)

4907
03:35:24.877 --> 03:35:26.853
TRAVIS: Okay, grab my hand.

4908
03:35:26.853 --> 03:35:29.523
And I'll cast Thunder Step again.

4909
03:35:29.523 --> 03:35:31.843
MATT: The tree splinters once more,

4910
03:35:31.843 --> 03:35:33.919
another impact to the side of it,

4911
03:35:33.919 --> 03:35:37.383
a slight indentation for about ten feet

4912
03:35:37.383 --> 03:35:40.132
where the force has blasted into the side of the tree.

4913
03:35:40.132 --> 03:35:43.282
You both now go from the 150-foot mark,

4914
03:35:43.282 --> 03:35:47.357
to the 240-foot mark

4915
03:35:49.598 --> 03:35:51.320
and then catch up onto the side of the tree

4916
03:35:51.320 --> 03:35:53.034
and you're now 240 feet up in the air,

4917
03:35:53.034 --> 03:35:54.201
you look down.

4918
03:35:55.766 --> 03:35:58.432
LAURA: That was not smart.

4919
03:35:59.666 --> 03:36:03.599
(nervous humming)

4920
03:36:03.599 --> 03:36:04.787
MATT: Make one more athletics check for me,

4921
03:36:04.787 --> 03:36:06.246
if you don't mind.

4922
03:36:06.246 --> 03:36:07.538
TALIESIN: Tying a rope to several people

4923
03:36:07.538 --> 03:36:09.173
would have been a clever idea as well.

4924
03:36:09.173 --> 03:36:10.342
LAURA: That doesn't count.

4925
03:36:10.342 --> 03:36:12.092
That escaped my hand.

4926
03:36:13.642 --> 03:36:14.962
TALIESIN: Really?

4927
03:36:14.962 --> 03:36:16.662
LAURA: 17?
MATT: 17.

4928
03:36:19.594 --> 03:36:20.677
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

4929
03:36:23.450 --> 03:36:25.459
MATT: I'll say with a natural 20--

4930
03:36:25.459 --> 03:36:29.834
the 17 gets you to the 290-foot mark,

4931
03:36:29.834 --> 03:36:31.555
but as you're getting up to that point,

4932
03:36:31.555 --> 03:36:33.117
Fjord just grabs you from the back,

4933
03:36:33.117 --> 03:36:37.106
grabs a rock and throws you up the last ten feet

4934
03:36:37.106 --> 03:36:38.471
and you catch onto the edge

4935
03:36:38.471 --> 03:36:40.454
of the bottom of the first branch

4936
03:36:40.454 --> 03:36:42.085
and hold yourself there.

4937
03:36:42.085 --> 03:36:43.719
Fjord, you climb the rest of the way up,

4938
03:36:43.719 --> 03:36:44.774
and both of you guys catch up.

4939
03:36:44.774 --> 03:36:47.231
MARISHA: I reach and grab Fjord and pull him up.

4940
03:36:47.231 --> 03:36:50.111
MATT: The three of you now make it up onto the branch.

4941
03:36:50.111 --> 03:36:50.944
LIAM: I have a question.

4942
03:36:50.944 --> 03:36:52.479
TRAVIS: Just right up the side of the fucking thing?

4943
03:36:52.479 --> 03:36:53.312
MARISHA: Woo! Yeah.

4944
03:36:54.915 --> 03:36:56.547
LAURA: Really fast Beau.
MARISHA: That was awesome.

4945
03:36:56.547 --> 03:36:57.927
LIAM: Polymorph works on self, right?

4946
03:36:57.927 --> 03:36:58.812
MATT: Yeah.

4947
03:36:58.812 --> 03:37:00.027
LIAM: So after watching all of that,

4948
03:37:00.027 --> 03:37:02.955
Caleb suddenly morphs into a giant eagle,

4949
03:37:02.955 --> 03:37:06.220
grabs Nott and hoists her into the air and flies.

4950
03:37:06.220 --> 03:37:07.303
TALIESIN: That-- okay.

4951
03:37:09.083 --> 03:37:11.067
MATT: Yasha and Caduceus are just sitting at the bottom.

4952
03:37:11.067 --> 03:37:12.729
LAURA: Giant eagles are smart?

4953
03:37:12.729 --> 03:37:15.983
That's good, it's better than a moth.

4954
03:37:15.983 --> 03:37:17.122
LIAM: I've been looking up intelligences

4955
03:37:17.122 --> 03:37:19.289
for the last five minutes.

4956
03:37:20.140 --> 03:37:21.561
Nope, nope, nope.

4957
03:37:21.561 --> 03:37:22.731
MATT: Clutching Nott you make your way up

4958
03:37:22.731 --> 03:37:24.517
and catch up to the inside of it.

4959
03:37:24.517 --> 03:37:27.127
So you're standing there now on the first branch,

4960
03:37:27.127 --> 03:37:31.827
it is just clustered net of extending branches

4961
03:37:31.827 --> 03:37:33.650
that all fold into each other,

4962
03:37:33.650 --> 03:37:36.127
giant leaves, leaves that are about four,

4963
03:37:36.127 --> 03:37:39.210
four and a half feet long end to end.

4964
03:37:40.575 --> 03:37:43.455
It feels like you're tiny people in a regular tree

4965
03:37:43.455 --> 03:37:45.038
from a perspective.

4966
03:37:46.231 --> 03:37:48.211
LIAM: Go Dog Go, at the end where they're all dancing

4967
03:37:48.211 --> 03:37:49.219
in the giant tree.

4968
03:37:49.219 --> 03:37:51.386
LAURA: Honey I Shrunk the Kids.

4969
03:37:52.287 --> 03:37:54.019
MARISHA: Do we see anything up there?

4970
03:37:54.019 --> 03:37:55.263
MATT: Make a perception check.

4971
03:37:55.263 --> 03:37:57.596
SAM: I'm going to look around, too.

4972
03:37:58.709 --> 03:37:59.542
17.

4973
03:38:04.743 --> 03:38:05.826
MARISHA: 17 as well.

4974
03:38:06.719 --> 03:38:08.819
MATT: Both looking up,

4975
03:38:08.819 --> 03:38:10.455
it's going to be a little easier to climb through here

4976
03:38:10.455 --> 03:38:13.423
because of the branches and such.

4977
03:38:13.423 --> 03:38:15.882
You do see a darker shape

4978
03:38:15.882 --> 03:38:19.199
maybe about 20 feet above you on

4979
03:38:19.199 --> 03:38:22.436
a cluster of branches matching over each other

4980
03:38:22.436 --> 03:38:25.439
like two hands holding.

4981
03:38:25.439 --> 03:38:28.060
SAM: Oh boy, could be a nest.

4982
03:38:28.060 --> 03:38:31.259
MATT: Looks very much like the edges of a very large nest.

4983
03:38:31.259 --> 03:38:32.861
SAM: Why are we going here?

4984
03:38:32.861 --> 03:38:34.572
What was this about?

4985
03:38:34.572 --> 03:38:35.683
LAURA: Because it seemed fun.

4986
03:38:35.683 --> 03:38:39.194
MARISHA: Can I walk to the edge of one of the boughs

4987
03:38:39.194 --> 03:38:40.027
and peek out

4988
03:38:40.027 --> 03:38:42.943
and can I get a nice aerial view?

4989
03:38:42.943 --> 03:38:45.151
MATT: Sure. All right, so you climb out carefully,

4990
03:38:45.151 --> 03:38:47.263
get to the very edge, peek out from it.

4991
03:38:47.263 --> 03:38:48.463
It's an incredible view.

4992
03:38:48.463 --> 03:38:49.455
You can see the Barbed Fields,

4993
03:38:49.455 --> 03:38:51.460
and now you like it's,

4994
03:38:51.460 --> 03:38:53.731
it's interesting. You can see a pattern.

4995
03:38:53.731 --> 03:38:55.274
There is a circular pattern

4996
03:38:55.274 --> 03:38:59.786
on the Barbed Fields of these various

4997
03:38:59.786 --> 03:39:02.155
jutting rock formations

4998
03:39:02.155 --> 03:39:03.759
that is more dense towards the center.

4999
03:39:03.759 --> 03:39:04.887
Not around where the tree is.

5000
03:39:04.887 --> 03:39:06.311
The tree isn't perfectly in the center.

5001
03:39:06.311 --> 03:39:07.824
It's placed in the vicinity,

5002
03:39:07.824 --> 03:39:09.865
but there does appear to be a shape

5003
03:39:09.865 --> 03:39:13.031
and in the center of it there is one large,

5004
03:39:13.031 --> 03:39:17.031
dipping chasm that pierces into the center.

5005
03:39:17.907 --> 03:39:20.619
MARISHA: How far away is it from where we are in the tree?

5006
03:39:20.619 --> 03:39:22.135
MATT: You guys must have passed it.

5007
03:39:22.135 --> 03:39:24.999
It was to the,

5008
03:39:24.999 --> 03:39:26.199
it would have been to the right,

5009
03:39:26.199 --> 03:39:27.790
or to the east of where you were.

5010
03:39:27.790 --> 03:39:28.623
So you guys have been traveling

5011
03:39:28.623 --> 03:39:30.002
a northwestern direction, so you've been

5012
03:39:30.002 --> 03:39:31.803
skirting along the edge

5013
03:39:31.803 --> 03:39:33.570
or not quite towards the center,

5014
03:39:33.570 --> 03:39:35.415
but it's more towards the center of the Barbed Fields.

5015
03:39:35.415 --> 03:39:37.441
You can see this large chasm that's dug

5016
03:39:37.441 --> 03:39:41.115
into the base and the rocks emanate from that.

5017
03:39:41.115 --> 03:39:44.311
LIAM: Amongst all these rocks, are there any enemies, orcs

5018
03:39:44.311 --> 03:39:45.931
anything traveling that we can see

5019
03:39:45.931 --> 03:39:47.911
with my eagle eyes?

5020
03:39:47.911 --> 03:39:49.213
MATT: Make a perception check.

5021
03:39:49.213 --> 03:39:50.713
LIAM: I got advantage.

5022
03:39:53.055 --> 03:39:55.724
Two 17s in a row, 19.

5023
03:39:55.724 --> 03:39:56.557
MATT: 19?

5024
03:39:58.651 --> 03:40:01.846
It's hard to make out a lot of details from this high up

5025
03:40:01.846 --> 03:40:04.983
specifically, but there are a number of creatures

5026
03:40:04.983 --> 03:40:07.035
in sight all over the place that live here.

5027
03:40:07.035 --> 03:40:08.535
Some scavenging, some hunting,

5028
03:40:08.535 --> 03:40:10.083
some just walking or moving,

5029
03:40:10.083 --> 03:40:11.895
some herds, some solitary.

5030
03:40:11.895 --> 03:40:13.392
You can see, just at this first glace,

5031
03:40:13.392 --> 03:40:15.647
somewhere in the neighborhood of a dozen or so udaaks,

5032
03:40:15.647 --> 03:40:19.712
the large beasts just scattered across

5033
03:40:19.712 --> 03:40:22.293
the fields both in front of you and to the right.

5034
03:40:22.293 --> 03:40:23.363
From where you're peeking out

5035
03:40:23.363 --> 03:40:24.380
and looking at the side now,

5036
03:40:24.380 --> 03:40:26.060
this would be the eastern side that you're looking

5037
03:40:26.060 --> 03:40:29.091
out towards the Barbed Fields.

5038
03:40:29.091 --> 03:40:31.775
You can see roving bands

5039
03:40:31.775 --> 03:40:33.093
of smaller humanoid creatures.

5040
03:40:33.093 --> 03:40:34.474
You're not sure if they're orcs or anything,

5041
03:40:34.474 --> 03:40:35.576
but you can see there are,

5042
03:40:35.576 --> 03:40:38.547
folk that live here or folk that wander through

5043
03:40:38.547 --> 03:40:41.620
possibly hunting or moving through the fields.

5044
03:40:41.620 --> 03:40:43.948
LAURA: I'm going to draw all of this in my book

5045
03:40:43.948 --> 03:40:46.184
like what we see below us

5046
03:40:46.184 --> 03:40:48.348
with the chasm and everything.

5047
03:40:48.348 --> 03:40:50.656
LIAM: Did you already narrate or say how far away

5048
03:40:50.656 --> 03:40:51.844
that chasm looked or?

5049
03:40:51.844 --> 03:40:53.884
MATT: The chasm is miles away.

5050
03:40:53.884 --> 03:40:54.736
LIAM: Miles away.

5051
03:40:54.736 --> 03:40:57.016
MATT: Yeah, it's probably another

5052
03:40:57.016 --> 03:40:59.131
four hours of travel from where you are.

5053
03:40:59.131 --> 03:41:01.428
SAM: How about the Penumbra Range, can we see that?

5054
03:41:01.428 --> 03:41:03.812
MATT: Oh yeah, from this point of where you're looking,

5055
03:41:03.812 --> 03:41:06.244
the Penumbra Range completely encompasses

5056
03:41:06.244 --> 03:41:08.565
you at the horizon.

5057
03:41:08.565 --> 03:41:10.188
What you're looking at

5058
03:41:10.188 --> 03:41:11.536
is the eastern side of them.

5059
03:41:11.536 --> 03:41:15.102
If you look at the map there, you can see

5060
03:41:15.102 --> 03:41:19.235
you guys are probably about here.

5061
03:41:21.087 --> 03:41:22.776
The Penumbra Range encompasses,

5062
03:41:22.776 --> 03:41:25.020
from your vision out this way,

5063
03:41:25.020 --> 03:41:27.978
the mountains just completely fill the horizon.

5064
03:41:27.978 --> 03:41:29.804
You can see that they taper a little bit

5065
03:41:29.804 --> 03:41:32.736
to the northern side from what you can view.

5066
03:41:32.736 --> 03:41:34.294
LIAM: And we're talking about on the horizon, right?

5067
03:41:34.294 --> 03:41:35.127
MATT: Yeah.

5068
03:41:37.700 --> 03:41:42.166
MARISHA: And any sign of Bazzoxan or are we--

5069
03:41:42.166 --> 03:41:43.516
MATT: You'd have to move around on the northern side

5070
03:41:43.516 --> 03:41:44.868
of the tree probably to get a view.

5071
03:41:44.868 --> 03:41:47.256
Because right now, you're peering out the eastern side

5072
03:41:47.256 --> 03:41:48.697
so Bazzoxan would be

5073
03:41:48.697 --> 03:41:50.462
visible probably from the northern side.

5074
03:41:50.462 --> 03:41:52.845
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's loop around to the other side.

5075
03:41:52.845 --> 03:41:54.071
Stealthily.
LIAM: (eagle squawk)

5076
03:41:54.071 --> 03:41:55.354
SAM: Ah!
LIAM: (wings flapping)

5077
03:41:55.354 --> 03:41:56.737
Out of the tree.
LAURA: Shh! The nest!

5078
03:41:58.684 --> 03:42:02.360
LAURA: I'll swing around and do a perimeter swing.

5079
03:42:02.360 --> 03:42:05.392
MATT: All right, you perimeter swing.

5080
03:42:05.392 --> 03:42:09.354
You do take a view of the space

5081
03:42:09.354 --> 03:42:11.584
and you can see thinly on the edge,

5082
03:42:11.584 --> 03:42:14.164
this little line that is probably

5083
03:42:14.164 --> 03:42:17.824
the Hallowed Path that curves around the perimeter.

5084
03:42:17.824 --> 03:42:20.824
The other path you could have taken.

5085
03:42:21.696 --> 03:42:25.308
You can see where the Penumbra Range tends to

5086
03:42:25.308 --> 03:42:27.156
to lessen and thin,

5087
03:42:27.156 --> 03:42:30.036
there's a small dark pebbled beach here

5088
03:42:30.036 --> 03:42:32.104
that goes to the cold waters,

5089
03:42:32.104 --> 03:42:34.880
looks like ocean that goes up this way

5090
03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:36.952
and the mountain range picks up once more.

5091
03:42:36.952 --> 03:42:38.916
Along where it begins to build up again,

5092
03:42:38.916 --> 03:42:41.228
you can see along the cliff face

5093
03:42:41.228 --> 03:42:46.228
some sort of structure built into it

5094
03:42:46.972 --> 03:42:48.232
like at the base of the mountain,

5095
03:42:48.232 --> 03:42:49.952
but you're too far away to make out much of the detail,

5096
03:42:49.952 --> 03:42:52.444
but you can see a small settlement of some kind.

5097
03:42:52.444 --> 03:42:53.444
It is small.

5098
03:42:55.864 --> 03:42:57.423
SAM: What are we doing in this fucking tree?

5099
03:42:57.423 --> 03:42:59.152
Let's get down and go.

5100
03:42:59.152 --> 03:43:00.455
LIAM: You're in the air.

5101
03:43:00.455 --> 03:43:02.909
SAM: (yells)

5102
03:43:02.909 --> 03:43:04.742
SAM: Put me down!
LIAM: (squawks)

5103
03:43:04.742 --> 03:43:06.904
SAM: Put me down.
LIAM: (bird croaks)

5104
03:43:06.904 --> 03:43:07.999
MARISHA: I still want to see if I can get

5105
03:43:07.999 --> 03:43:09.092
to the other side of the tree

5106
03:43:09.092 --> 03:43:11.568
and see if we can get eyes on Bazzoxan

5107
03:43:11.568 --> 03:43:12.528
because we didn't really see it,

5108
03:43:12.528 --> 03:43:13.424
did they see it just now?

5109
03:43:13.424 --> 03:43:16.501
MATT: They did, but you don't know that.

5110
03:43:16.501 --> 03:43:18.334
SAM: We just saw Bazzoxan.

5111
03:43:20.375 --> 03:43:22.938
LIAM: Drunken goblin dangling off--

5112
03:43:22.938 --> 03:43:25.099
TRAVIS: (like Nott) Oh my god.

5113
03:43:25.099 --> 03:43:27.165
MARISHA: You want to walk over there or you think it's safe

5114
03:43:27.165 --> 03:43:28.556
navigating around this thing,

5115
03:43:28.556 --> 03:43:30.639
this giant's bird's nest?

5116
03:43:31.728 --> 03:43:33.311
TRAVIS: Follow your lead?

5117
03:43:35.376 --> 03:43:36.876
MARISHA: Yeah, all right.

5118
03:43:38.137 --> 03:43:38.970
MATT: Okay.

5119
03:43:40.904 --> 03:43:42.900
MARISHA: That's me stealthing.

5120
03:43:42.900 --> 03:43:45.272
MATT: Okay, you can make athletics or acrobatics checks,

5121
03:43:45.272 --> 03:43:48.284
your choice to make your way through these bows.

5122
03:43:48.284 --> 03:43:50.432
MARISHA: Acrobatics for Beau.

5123
03:43:50.432 --> 03:43:52.481
TRAVIS: 16, athletics.

5124
03:43:52.481 --> 03:43:56.684
MARISHA: A natural 19 plus nine, so.

5125
03:43:56.684 --> 03:43:58.316
LAURA: Natural 20.

5126
03:43:58.316 --> 03:43:59.476
MARISHA: 28.

5127
03:43:59.476 --> 03:44:01.456
MATT: And I can also get stealth checks from you guys,

5128
03:44:01.456 --> 03:44:03.512
you succeeded in your pass,

5129
03:44:03.512 --> 03:44:04.632
but I want to see how quietly you do so.

5130
03:44:04.632 --> 03:44:07.208
LAURA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace on us?

5131
03:44:07.208 --> 03:44:08.041
MATT: No.

5132
03:44:08.908 --> 03:44:09.754
TRAVIS: Nine.

5133
03:44:09.754 --> 03:44:11.912
LIAM: Beau's hopping through the tree like Chow Yun-Fat.

5134
03:44:11.912 --> 03:44:13.208
MARISHA: 21.

5135
03:44:13.208 --> 03:44:14.041
LAURA: 20.

5136
03:44:15.787 --> 03:44:16.914
MATT: 20, 21, what?

5137
03:44:16.914 --> 03:44:17.747
TRAVIS: Nine.

5138
03:44:17.747 --> 03:44:18.580
MATT: Nine.

5139
03:44:19.695 --> 03:44:23.459
Okay, yeah that's better two out of three.

5140
03:44:23.459 --> 03:44:24.707
You carefully make your way around,

5141
03:44:24.707 --> 03:44:29.159
at one point, you grab branch, Fjord, that breaks loudly

5142
03:44:29.159 --> 03:44:31.153
and you wait.

5143
03:44:31.153 --> 03:44:34.379
You hear some heavy shifting,

5144
03:44:34.379 --> 03:44:39.379
cracking and moving of wood and stick,

5145
03:44:39.539 --> 03:44:43.527
and you can see now dust and leaf clusters,

5146
03:44:43.527 --> 03:44:45.794
and broken bits of branch begin to tumble down

5147
03:44:45.794 --> 03:44:46.798
from where the nest is.

5148
03:44:46.798 --> 03:44:49.618
You see some shape shift and move

5149
03:44:49.618 --> 03:44:52.287
and these wide, long feathers

5150
03:44:52.287 --> 03:44:57.287
coast around the outer edge of the nest

5151
03:44:57.358 --> 03:45:01.455
as a big dark head begins to peer off the side,

5152
03:45:01.455 --> 03:45:04.827
pointed hooked bill at the edge.

5153
03:45:04.827 --> 03:45:07.035
You all stop and pull up quietly,

5154
03:45:07.035 --> 03:45:08.279
like finding a leaf.

5155
03:45:08.279 --> 03:45:09.716
TRAVIS: I use Disguise Self to turn

5156
03:45:09.716 --> 03:45:13.061
entirely brown like the branch.

5157
03:45:13.061 --> 03:45:16.337
MARISHA: Full stick bug.
LIAM: Schwarzenegger-ing?

5158
03:45:16.337 --> 03:45:18.087
MATT: (Schwarzenegger accent) I'm here! Kill me!

5159
03:45:20.441 --> 03:45:21.899
TRAVIS: (Schwarzenegger accent) Didn't see me.

5160
03:45:21.899 --> 03:45:24.403
MATT: But overall you guys rolled high enough stealth

5161
03:45:24.403 --> 03:45:26.143
to avoid its passive perception.

5162
03:45:26.143 --> 03:45:30.058
LAURA: I like that you're already like green and brown.

5163
03:45:30.058 --> 03:45:31.439
TRAVIS: All brown right now.

5164
03:45:31.439 --> 03:45:33.522
And not just in my pants.

5165
03:45:36.779 --> 03:45:40.295
MATT: It peers forward and looks around,

5166
03:45:40.295 --> 03:45:43.036
(bird croaking)

5167
03:45:46.903 --> 03:45:51.570
and withdraws back to the nest and then it goes to rest.

5168
03:45:52.543 --> 03:45:54.567
TRAVIS: Maybe you go on ahead without me.

5169
03:45:54.567 --> 03:45:55.991
LAURA: No, Fjord, you're coming, come on.

5170
03:45:55.991 --> 03:45:59.471
TRAVIS: I'll just stay here, you go, all right.

5171
03:45:59.471 --> 03:46:02.529
MATT: You make it the rest of the way carefully

5172
03:46:02.529 --> 03:46:04.929
and it takes you a while.

5173
03:46:04.929 --> 03:46:08.322
This is a dangerous, difficult thing to do quietly.

5174
03:46:08.322 --> 03:46:12.289
I'd say it takes the better part of an hour and a half

5175
03:46:12.289 --> 03:46:16.221
to make it through all these branches quietly

5176
03:46:16.221 --> 03:46:19.069
around what is-- the perimeter of travel, you guys,

5177
03:46:19.069 --> 03:46:20.658
to move from the eastern side to that,

5178
03:46:20.658 --> 03:46:23.141
you're moving I'd say about

5179
03:46:24.624 --> 03:46:26.317
200 to 250 feet

5180
03:46:26.317 --> 03:46:31.317
through very careful, deliberate, quiet movements

5181
03:46:31.545 --> 03:46:34.009
so it's like, like sloth climbing.

5182
03:46:34.009 --> 03:46:37.259
TRAVIS: Is there any flower up here or fruit?

5183
03:46:38.313 --> 03:46:40.069
MATT: Make a perception check.

5184
03:46:40.069 --> 03:46:41.613
SAM: You hungry?

5185
03:46:41.613 --> 03:46:44.957
TRAVIS: I'm in a big ass ancient tree, I don't know, ten.

5186
03:46:44.957 --> 03:46:48.017
MATT: Looking around here, you don't see any fruit

5187
03:46:48.017 --> 03:46:50.369
or flowers around it, unfortunately.

5188
03:46:50.369 --> 03:46:52.561
MARISHA: Any roc feathers?

5189
03:46:52.561 --> 03:46:54.556
Molted off?

5190
03:46:54.556 --> 03:46:55.621
MATT: None that are in the immediate vicinity,

5191
03:46:55.621 --> 03:46:57.856
but you're sure there's probably a few in the nest,

5192
03:46:57.856 --> 03:46:58.949
if you wanted to go give it a shot.

5193
03:46:58.949 --> 03:47:00.556
MARISHA: No.

5194
03:47:00.556 --> 03:47:01.817
No.

5195
03:47:01.817 --> 03:47:04.081
TALIESIN: I bet there's a magic sword in there,

5196
03:47:04.081 --> 03:47:05.341
just sitting there.

5197
03:47:05.341 --> 03:47:07.508
MATT: Make a perception check.

5198
03:47:08.967 --> 03:47:10.649
TRAVIS: We got to get in the nest.

5199
03:47:10.649 --> 03:47:12.508
TALIESIN: Did I just ruin, did I just kill you?

5200
03:47:12.508 --> 03:47:13.349
MATT: 16?

5201
03:47:13.349 --> 03:47:15.197
TALIESIN: Did I actually just murder Travis' character?

5202
03:47:15.197 --> 03:47:18.257
MATT: I will say, a little bit past where you guys

5203
03:47:18.257 --> 03:47:19.859
got to the northern side, you do see

5204
03:47:19.859 --> 03:47:22.249
one feather

5205
03:47:22.249 --> 03:47:25.501
that's left and tangled

5206
03:47:25.501 --> 03:47:27.991
in some of the vines.

5207
03:47:27.991 --> 03:47:29.429
MARISHA: How big is it?

5208
03:47:29.429 --> 03:47:31.425
MATT: The feather is probably about

5209
03:47:31.425 --> 03:47:35.861
three feet from tip to tip, if not four feet.

5210
03:47:35.861 --> 03:47:38.709
MARISHA: Can I get to it fairly easily?

5211
03:47:38.709 --> 03:47:41.484
MATT: You can certainly try.
LAURA: Four feet from tip to tip?

5212
03:47:41.484 --> 03:47:42.758
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll try.

5213
03:47:43.901 --> 03:47:45.089
LAURA: That's a big-ass feather.

5214
03:47:45.089 --> 03:47:46.677
MATT: It's a big-ass bird.

5215
03:47:46.677 --> 03:47:49.177
LAURA: That's a real big bird.

5216
03:47:49.177 --> 03:47:50.510
MATT: You going to try?

5217
03:47:51.689 --> 03:47:53.909
TRAVIS: Are there any Vestiges of Divergence in the nest?

5218
03:47:53.909 --> 03:47:56.076
MATT: Make an athletics check.

5219
03:47:57.372 --> 03:47:58.993
MARISHA: That was almost great.

5220
03:47:58.993 --> 03:48:01.993
Athletics, 15.

5221
03:48:01.993 --> 03:48:04.406
MATT: Athletics or acrobatics.

5222
03:48:04.406 --> 03:48:05.909
MARISHA: Then 16.

5223
03:48:05.909 --> 03:48:07.452
MATT: 16, all righty.

5224
03:48:07.452 --> 03:48:09.221
MARISHA: No 15, 15.

5225
03:48:09.221 --> 03:48:12.638
MATT: You carefully make your way over there,

5226
03:48:15.420 --> 03:48:16.381
make another stealth check.

5227
03:48:16.381 --> 03:48:18.189
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

5228
03:48:20.477 --> 03:48:23.385
Wow, that was some acrobatic shit.

5229
03:48:23.385 --> 03:48:25.583
MARISHA: I'm going to keep it, 22.

5230
03:48:25.583 --> 03:48:28.327
MATT: You make your way over there

5231
03:48:28.327 --> 03:48:30.427
and you reach for it, and you're about to grab one branch,

5232
03:48:30.427 --> 03:48:33.743
but you notice at its base that it is cracked

5233
03:48:33.743 --> 03:48:36.879
and grabbing it might have lost your footing

5234
03:48:36.879 --> 03:48:38.625
or doing so to keep yourself would have been

5235
03:48:38.625 --> 03:48:40.951
a very loud noise and so you pull back a bit.

5236
03:48:40.951 --> 03:48:43.829
You curve around, eventually finding your way to the edge

5237
03:48:43.829 --> 03:48:46.487
and then grasp. You take the feather,

5238
03:48:46.487 --> 03:48:48.555
and carefully dislodge it without making a noise

5239
03:48:48.555 --> 03:48:50.971
and it's a little, you know,

5240
03:48:50.971 --> 03:48:55.971
tousled on one side, but you have a four-foot roc feather.

5241
03:48:56.207 --> 03:48:57.671
MARISHA: I don't know, I just wanted it.

5242
03:48:57.671 --> 03:48:58.504
TRAVIS: Bag of holding right here.

5243
03:48:58.504 --> 03:49:00.520
Bag of holding right here.

5244
03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:03.035
LIAM: Burlesque act!

5245
03:49:03.035 --> 03:49:06.110
TRAVIS: Want to slide that bitch in here?

5246
03:49:07.535 --> 03:49:09.425
One roc feather.

5247
03:49:09.425 --> 03:49:11.252
MATT: And from this point, looking across the vista,

5248
03:49:11.252 --> 03:49:12.259
you making your way to the edge,

5249
03:49:12.259 --> 03:49:16.747
you, too, can see the settlement of Bazzoxan.

5250
03:49:16.747 --> 03:49:18.951
MARISHA: Hey, there it is.

5251
03:49:18.951 --> 03:49:20.575
MATT: As you watch an eagle go by holding Nott.

5252
03:49:20.575 --> 03:49:22.575
SAM: (yelling) Bazzoxan is over there.

5253
03:49:25.401 --> 03:49:28.179
MATT: What are you guys doing?

5254
03:49:28.179 --> 03:49:31.075
TRAVIS: Being attacked by 12 fucking wooly mammoths.

5255
03:49:31.075 --> 03:49:32.527
ASHLEY: Knocking on the tree.

5256
03:49:32.527 --> 03:49:33.944
This is--

5257
03:49:35.275 --> 03:49:37.613
can you feel her when you touch the tree or something?

5258
03:49:37.613 --> 03:49:39.115
TALIESIN: I was entirely not paying attention,

5259
03:49:39.115 --> 03:49:41.995
I was starting to like weave, just

5260
03:49:41.995 --> 03:49:44.551
make a brand new hat out of bits,

5261
03:49:44.551 --> 03:49:46.917
I've just been basket weaving, basically,

5262
03:49:46.917 --> 03:49:49.079
at this point, out of the tall grass.

5263
03:49:49.079 --> 03:49:53.647
Ah yeah, no it hadn't even occurred to me to--

5264
03:49:53.647 --> 03:49:55.220
this is really not going to go with

5265
03:49:55.220 --> 03:49:56.567
what you're wearing at all.

5266
03:49:56.567 --> 03:49:57.443
ASHLEY: Is this for me?

5267
03:49:57.443 --> 03:50:00.051
TALIESIN: I mean, I figure we're here and you know--

5268
03:50:00.051 --> 03:50:03.124
ASHLEY: This is-- oh, I'll try it on.

5269
03:50:03.124 --> 03:50:04.731
TALIESIN: It's only half a hat right now, but sure.

5270
03:50:04.731 --> 03:50:07.851
ASHLEY: Oh, well, you can see if it fits.

5271
03:50:07.851 --> 03:50:09.351
Is it okay?

5272
03:50:09.351 --> 03:50:10.867
TALIESIN: <i>I</i> like it.

5273
03:50:10.867 --> 03:50:13.071
ASHLEY: Okay, it's a little jaunty.

5274
03:50:13.071 --> 03:50:14.654
TALIESIN: Let's keep going.

5275
03:50:16.566 --> 03:50:17.399
MATT: Perfect.

5276
03:50:19.637 --> 03:50:21.565
As you guys are taking this moment to take it in

5277
03:50:21.565 --> 03:50:22.426
it is a beautiful vista,

5278
03:50:22.426 --> 03:50:24.947
against the light rain.

5279
03:50:24.947 --> 03:50:26.103
It's not a lightning storm at this point,

5280
03:50:26.103 --> 03:50:28.681
it's just a light rain. It is a beautiful sight

5281
03:50:28.681 --> 03:50:32.830
of this normally not beautiful location,

5282
03:50:32.830 --> 03:50:34.801
but this height put everything into perspective

5283
03:50:34.801 --> 03:50:37.275
and you know, from where you all started together

5284
03:50:37.275 --> 03:50:39.047
as finding yourselves in a tavern,

5285
03:50:39.047 --> 03:50:41.595
it's wild to think for a second you're

5286
03:50:41.595 --> 03:50:43.003
amongst the boughs of this

5287
03:50:43.003 --> 03:50:47.420
massive divine tree looking upon the land of Xhorhas.

5288
03:50:48.824 --> 03:50:52.711
Interesting thought that comes to you, Fjord.

5289
03:50:52.711 --> 03:50:55.035
Usually when you cast your spells,

5290
03:50:55.035 --> 03:50:59.068
there's like a shot of cold sensation

5291
03:50:59.068 --> 03:51:00.913
that shoots through you with the casting.

5292
03:51:00.913 --> 03:51:02.415
An element of cold water,

5293
03:51:02.415 --> 03:51:07.187
or a deep ocean type flash of temperature

5294
03:51:07.187 --> 03:51:08.507
that just courses through you

5295
03:51:08.507 --> 03:51:10.035
that you're just used to whenever you've

5296
03:51:10.035 --> 03:51:11.535
utilized your magic.

5297
03:51:11.535 --> 03:51:13.306
The times you saved Jester, in the moment

5298
03:51:13.306 --> 03:51:16.420
you didn't think about it, and then now thinking back,

5299
03:51:16.420 --> 03:51:19.968
that wasn't there. It was a little warmer.

5300
03:51:19.968 --> 03:51:23.748
The magic was still there, but there wasn't--

5301
03:51:23.748 --> 03:51:26.868
each time you felt like there was a small-scale

5302
03:51:26.868 --> 03:51:29.584
siphoning of your body temperature,

5303
03:51:29.584 --> 03:51:34.492
some sort of a shift of that cold ocean.

5304
03:51:35.518 --> 03:51:36.351
TRAVIS: Okay.

5305
03:51:39.108 --> 03:51:40.525
MATT: It's interesting.

5306
03:51:42.424 --> 03:51:45.904
SAM: Should we float down and continue on?

5307
03:51:45.904 --> 03:51:48.904
LAURA: I'm going to draw a picture of Beau and Fjord

5308
03:51:48.904 --> 03:51:51.168
sitting on the branch with

5309
03:51:51.168 --> 03:51:54.918
the grand vista behind them in the tree.

5310
03:51:58.411 --> 03:51:59.688
No, it's candid, you guys! Pretend like

5311
03:51:59.688 --> 03:52:02.242
you don't know I'm drawing you.

5312
03:52:02.242 --> 03:52:03.742
Yeah, it's better.

5313
03:52:06.782 --> 03:52:09.038
That's good.
MATT: Perfect.

5314
03:52:09.038 --> 03:52:11.242
LIAM: At some point, they crawled like an hour and a half

5315
03:52:11.242 --> 03:52:12.290
through the tree?

5316
03:52:12.290 --> 03:52:13.623
MATT: An hour, yeah.

5317
03:52:13.623 --> 03:52:16.790
LIAM: Okay, well then, I'm going to say that Caleb

5318
03:52:16.790 --> 03:52:20.618
would have known to land in the branches

5319
03:52:20.618 --> 03:52:22.686
undo and redo so,

5320
03:52:22.686 --> 03:52:24.786
still just so we don't plummet to our death.

5321
03:52:24.786 --> 03:52:26.377
MATT: Yeah.

5322
03:52:26.377 --> 03:52:27.606
TRAVIS: How we getting down?

5323
03:52:27.606 --> 03:52:28.907
SAM: We're going to float down.

5324
03:52:28.907 --> 03:52:30.313
TRAVIS: Who's doing that?

5325
03:52:30.313 --> 03:52:32.699
LIAM: (cawing)
SAM: I'll do it.

5326
03:52:32.699 --> 03:52:35.096
TRAVIS: Are you going to do it on everybody?

5327
03:52:35.096 --> 03:52:37.078
SAM: I can do it on us, yeah.
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

5328
03:52:37.078 --> 03:52:38.683
LIAM: Yay, do it, I want to float.

5329
03:52:38.683 --> 03:52:41.411
LIAM: Huffing and flapping his wings.

5330
03:52:41.411 --> 03:52:43.283
SAM: I mean, we could also ride on Caleb.

5331
03:52:43.283 --> 03:52:45.546
LAURA: There's a big bird.

5332
03:52:45.546 --> 03:52:47.139
MATT: There's a shifting sound.

5333
03:52:47.139 --> 03:52:50.031
TRAVIS: Fuck, out of the tree now.

5334
03:52:50.031 --> 03:52:52.575
MATT: On the upper nest region--

5335
03:52:52.575 --> 03:52:54.945
MARISHA: Nott, do the thing, Nott, do the thing,

5336
03:52:54.945 --> 03:52:56.904
do the thing, Nott!

5337
03:52:56.904 --> 03:52:59.335
(laughter)

5338
03:52:59.335 --> 03:53:02.098
MATT: Fjord and Beau leap from it and a moment later,

5339
03:53:02.098 --> 03:53:04.186
Jester and Nott.

5340
03:53:04.186 --> 03:53:07.137
LIAM: Nott just says: Did you hear something?

5341
03:53:07.137 --> 03:53:11.909
(laughter)

5342
03:53:11.909 --> 03:53:13.841
TRAVIS: Cast that shit.

5343
03:53:13.841 --> 03:53:16.018
MATT: That's two campaigns, Marisha!

5344
03:53:16.018 --> 03:53:19.018
(laughter)

5345
03:53:19.018 --> 03:53:22.185
MARISHA: This only like 300 feet.

5346
03:53:23.153 --> 03:53:28.153
MATT: So they're all just falling out of the tree rapidly,

5347
03:53:28.302 --> 03:53:29.997
the eagle swooping underneath you guys

5348
03:53:29.997 --> 03:53:31.961
looking up and watch, but just around the way,

5349
03:53:31.961 --> 03:53:33.609
they've curved around the tree now,

5350
03:53:33.609 --> 03:53:35.021
quite further than you recall,

5351
03:53:35.021 --> 03:53:38.949
the rest of your party just plummeting.

5352
03:53:38.949 --> 03:53:40.345
LAURA: Like swimming in the air.

5353
03:53:40.345 --> 03:53:42.366
MATT: And they begin to drift slowly.

5354
03:53:42.366 --> 03:53:44.900
SAM: Hold hands, we'll make like shapes.

5355
03:53:44.900 --> 03:53:48.042
MATT: And they begin slowly drifting.

5356
03:53:49.643 --> 03:53:51.295
SAM: Make a triangle and I'll go in the middle

5357
03:53:51.295 --> 03:53:52.628
and spin around.

5358
03:53:54.458 --> 03:53:55.807
MATT: As they're slowly drifting,

5359
03:53:55.807 --> 03:53:58.959
you watch the canopy of the tree shift

5360
03:53:58.959 --> 03:54:01.145
and something in it shake. Dust

5361
03:54:01.145 --> 03:54:04.193
and bits of branch and leaves begin to fall

5362
03:54:04.193 --> 03:54:05.063
and you hear

5363
03:54:05.063 --> 03:54:07.980
(wings flapping).

5364
03:54:12.743 --> 03:54:17.293
This darkened, massive shape of a roc

5365
03:54:19.239 --> 03:54:23.239
comes piercing out of the canopy above all of you

5366
03:54:24.127 --> 03:54:28.195
and begins to curve back around towards the tree.

5367
03:54:28.195 --> 03:54:31.362
And that's where we pick up next week.

5368
03:54:34.216 --> 03:54:36.148
LAURA: Oh no.

5369
03:54:36.148 --> 03:54:38.236
TRAVIS: Oh no.

5370
03:54:38.236 --> 03:54:40.864
LAURA: There's no end to the things in this area.

5371
03:54:40.864 --> 03:54:42.496
SAM: So many birds.

5372
03:54:42.496 --> 03:54:45.184
TALIESIN: I'm so excited to see the maps you guys just drew

5373
03:54:45.184 --> 03:54:48.468
because I want to see if there's anything like I saw.

5374
03:54:48.468 --> 03:54:50.744
It's going to be nice.

5375
03:54:50.744 --> 03:54:53.188
It's going to be so nice.

5376
03:54:53.188 --> 03:54:55.800
MATT: All righty we'll pick up from this,

5377
03:54:55.800 --> 03:54:58.126
very unique excursion.

5378
03:54:58.126 --> 03:55:01.035
TRAVIS: I have so many questions.

5379
03:55:01.035 --> 03:55:02.596
MATT: And we're going to get home and finish packing

5380
03:55:02.596 --> 03:55:05.025
and head out to Denver first thing in the morning.

5381
03:55:05.025 --> 03:55:07.316
SAM: We'll see people in Denver soon enough.
MATT: Indeed, we'll--

5382
03:55:07.316 --> 03:55:09.207
(yelling)

5383
03:55:09.207 --> 03:55:10.765
SAM: No, don't do it!

5384
03:55:10.765 --> 03:55:13.601
LAURA: Oh my god, you're right, this is a wreck.

5385
03:55:13.601 --> 03:55:14.518
No, I can't.

5386
03:55:15.597 --> 03:55:17.264
MARISHA: Not on the equipment!

5387
03:55:18.448 --> 03:55:21.283
Goddamn it, end the show.

5388
03:55:21.283 --> 03:55:23.919
MATT: Look, you're going to make him pop a blood vessel.

5389
03:55:23.919 --> 03:55:26.169
(laughter)

5390
03:55:28.359 --> 03:55:31.883
MARISHA: Shut it down, shut it down.

5391
03:55:31.883 --> 03:55:35.300
MATT: All right, guys, we'll see you next week.

5392
03:55:37.987 --> 03:55:39.771
LIAM: Still so handsome, though.

5393
03:55:39.771 --> 03:55:41.121
TRAVIS: Is that it, we're out?

5394
03:55:41.121 --> 03:55:43.788
ASHLEY: Oh, it smells so bad.

5395
03:55:44.748 --> 03:55:47.998
MATT: I get the one liquid shot from Laura.

5396
03:55:50.869 --> 03:55:53.147
MARISHA: You bitch.

5397
03:55:53.147 --> 03:55:54.630
TRAVIS: It smells terrible.

5398
03:55:54.630 --> 03:55:56.799
LAURA: You can attack me, go for it, Matt.

5399
03:55:56.799 --> 03:55:58.479
MATT: All right, guys.

5400
03:55:58.479 --> 03:56:00.475
TALIESIN: We're not out.

5401
03:56:00.475 --> 03:56:04.071
MATT: I didn't sign off yet, you assholes!

5402
03:56:04.071 --> 03:56:05.772
TALIESIN: Oh god, it's in my tea, man.

5403
03:56:05.772 --> 03:56:07.752
MATT: All right guys, we'll see you next week.

5404
03:56:07.752 --> 03:56:12.752
We love you very much and it it Thursday yet? Bye.

5405
03:56:12.778 --> 03:56:17.336

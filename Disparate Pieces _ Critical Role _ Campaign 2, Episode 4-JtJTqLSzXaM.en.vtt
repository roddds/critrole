00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.928
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:07.459
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:13.003
(cheering)

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:17.209
MATT: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Before we
jump in to tonight's episode, we're going to go ahead

00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:20.685
and do some quick announcements. First and
foremost, our returning sponsor and long-time

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:29.284
partner for this campaign's beginning, on into the
foreseeable future, hopefully: D&amp;amp;D Beyond. They've

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:31.535
been awesome. Sam, do you have a few words you
want to say?

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:38.740
SAM: Guys, hi! Sam Riegel, here. It's award
season, so tonight I'm going to announce the D&amp;amp;D

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.293
Beyond Awards. The envelope, please!

00:00:41.293 --> 00:00:43.207
TRAVIS: Paper cut.

00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:51.480
SAM: Okay, nervous, really nervous. There's
nothing in here. Best discount codes for books in

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:02.626
the D&amp;amp;D Beyond store? The winner is: beginnings.
"Beginnings" is the discount code! Best URL on the

00:01:02.626 --> 00:01:12.821
entire internet? The winner is: DNDBeyond.com!
Best picture--

00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:15.705
LAURA: This is so stupid.

00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:18.789
SAM: La La Land. It's Moonlight.

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.832
(cheering)

00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:23.877
MARISHA: Old jokes.

00:01:23.877 --> 00:01:37.699
SAM: Best way to build a Blood Hunter? Activate
Critical Role content on DNDBeyond.com! Best

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:47.850
supporting actor? Sam Riegel. Best job opening at
a D&amp;amp;D-related internet company? Front-End

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.331
Developer. I guess they're looking for a front-end
developer. Someone will put a URL somewhere on here.

00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:59.643
MATT: At careers.com is where you can go to the
Careers tab.

00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:05.655
SAM: Thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond, for being our
official-- What are they calling it?

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:07.495
LAURA: Sponsor?

00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:13.495
SAM: No, not sponsor. They're the official tool
set of Critical Role.

00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:15.848
LAURA: Oh, that's cool.

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:18.742
TRAVIS: Well done! Is that the first annual--

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:30.941
SAM: The first annual awards show. What should we
call them? Not the Oscars. The Critters. No. The Sponsees.

00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:35.484
LAURA: Ooh, The Sponsees. That's fancy.

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:38.129
LIAM: That was strangely manic and desperate.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:45.927
MARISHA: Isn't every awards show, though?

00:02:45.927 --> 00:02:48.749
LIAM: Did you literally write that in the bathroom
six minutes ago?

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.946
SAM: For sure.

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:55.914
MATT: I feel like Kendrick Lamar should've won
at least two of those, but...

00:02:55.914 --> 00:03:00.363
Thank you, Sam. Thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond. You
can find them on DNDbeyond.com. That's

00:03:00.363 --> 00:03:10.044
DNDbeyond.com. Next up, based on tonight's
episode, we'll have next Tuesday, at 7:00PM

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:15.382
Pacific Time, here on Twitch and Alpha, Talks
Machina, where members of the cast will come, with

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:19.518
our fantastic Brian W. Foster, to discuss what
transpires tonight. You get to ask questions and

00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:28.547
submit them, so do so. Asinine Wisdom, next week
on Geek &amp;amp; Sundry Twitch, has a special guest. I

00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:31.068
believe our very own Sam Riegel will be there.

00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:32.573
SAM: Oh, god.

00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:33.979
LAURA: You're actually doing something else on the
internet?

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:42.327
SAM: I always do shows on Geek &amp;amp; Sundry, and this
is no change. What's the show called again?

00:03:42.327 --> 00:03:51.352
MATT: Asinine Wisdom. It's at 9:00PM on Tuesday,
Pacific Time, after Talks Machina. A double-dose

00:03:51.352 --> 00:04:04.645
of Sam Riegel, which is a lot. We have a new show
coming up here, featuring the Weave RPG, from The

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:09.420
Monocle Society, called Weave. That'll be showing
next Wednesday night at 9:30 Pacific Standard

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.561
Time, here on the Twitch Channel. Check it out
then. It has a great cast of Amy Dallen, Gina

00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:18.068
DeVivo, Whitney Moore, Becca Scott, and Stef
Woodward, so check it out! I hope you like it.

00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:24.174
Weave is really awesome. I'm really excited to see
that. The podcast of episode three last week

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:28.738
released today, so if you missed the last episode,
or have friends who have been trying to keep up with the

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:34.720
podcast, last week's episode is available for
download. Once again, we have issue number four of

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.008
Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins. It's
available for download digitally, on Comixology,

00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:43.008
the Dark Horse app, and all other places where
fine digital comic books are sold.

00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:46.106
TRAVIS: Go get it, rate it, love it. Show us that
you're reading it.

00:04:46.106 --> 00:04:49.372
LIAM: Burn it. Not the book, Laura's die.

00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:51.351
SAM: I've got to help her choose her dice.

00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:52.977
MATT: No! Why would you do that? You know better!

00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:55.273
SAM: I've already cursed two of them.

00:04:55.273 --> 00:05:02.239
LAURA: They're out. All the ones that got selected
tonight are shades of pinks, purples and blues and

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:03.521
I think it's lovely.

00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:06.435
MATT: It's like watching a video of guys putting
their hands in alligator mouths. Like, why would

00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:16.879
you do that? It's entertaining for us, but why
would you do that? Once again, our fantastic

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:22.949
charity, 826LA. If you get the opportunity to
either give and help out or donate your time to

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:28.411
help teach any of their fantastic classes to help
children learn creative writing in environments

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:32.706
where it's hard to find that type of tutelage.
It's a great program. Check it out at your local

00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:34.471
826 chapter and see if you can help out.

00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:37.529
MARISHA: Tell them you want to run a D&amp;amp;D game for
them.

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.868
MATT: I think that's it.

00:05:41.868 --> 00:05:43.146
LAURA: That was so fast, though!

00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:44.187
MATT: I know.

00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:49.313
SAM: The comic book is out.

00:05:49.313 --> 00:05:53.405
LAURA: What about our appearances coming up?

00:05:53.405 --> 00:06:01.045
LIAM: I'm going to be at BAK-Anime this weekend.
Two days only in Bakersfield, California. I will

00:06:01.045 --> 00:06:03.245
talk and I will go out in public.

00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:07.660
LAURA: Me and Travis--

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.134
TRAVIS: Travis and I--

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:18.669
LAURA: Travis and I are going to be at Emerald
City Comic Con the first weekend in March.

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:28.095
MATT: I'll be at Lexington Comic and Toy Con in
Lexington, Kentucky. That's March 9th to the 11th.

00:06:28.095 --> 00:06:32.739
I'll be at Otafest in Calgary, up north, May 18th
to the 20th.

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:35.307
TRAVIS: Keep it within a few months, for the love of--

00:06:35.307 --> 00:06:42.868
MATT: And A-Kon in Texas, June 7th to the 10th. If
you are anywhere near those regions. I've said

00:06:42.868 --> 00:06:48.014
before, I'm going to take this off the sheet for
the future. We've said that a lot now. Hey, it's

00:06:48.014 --> 00:06:53.422
not my job to update that sheet. Anyway guys, I'll
remember this.

00:06:53.422 --> 00:07:04.180
MARISHA: You should go check out Good Fortnight
Kevin on Alpha because it's a morning show and

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.945
it's funny. It's dumb and it's super meta.

00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:17.129
MATT: Super meta funny dumb show. All right. It
appears that the dice have been culled.

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:20.083
LAURA: We're on the last one, so we're solid.

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:29.514
MATT: Then let's go ahead and dive into tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

00:07:29.514 --> 00:07:33.644
[click, TV static]

00:07:33.644 --> 00:08:51.331
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:51.399 --> 00:09:00.519
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, our group of
adventurers had found their various individual

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:05.577
fates come together here in the city of
Trostenwald, where they had attended a carnival

00:09:05.577 --> 00:09:12.199
that had blown into town, had watched a horrible
occurrence happen where one of the older attendees

00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:19.245
transformed into this terrifying zombie creature.
Upon defeating it, you were all put under

00:09:19.245 --> 00:09:24.499
investigation as possible culprits for the reason
that it occurred. In trying to wander the city to

00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:29.599
investigate and try and clear your name, you
eventually found that there was a fiend hiding

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:36.295
amongst these carnival workers. This large
devil-like toad creature, which through some

00:09:36.295 --> 00:09:41.593
research you had found to actually be called a
nergaliid, had killed two more of the guards,

00:09:41.593 --> 00:09:49.188
leaving you to fend with their transformed forms,
and then fled deep into the center of the Ustaloch Lake.

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:51.402
(clattering off-camera)

00:09:51.402 --> 00:09:57.501
MATT: Thank you for the punctuation. Upon
gathering your supplies after a night's rest, you

00:09:57.501 --> 00:10:04.071
managed to, through the trade of a bottle of wine, get
passage across the lake onto the central island,

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:12.065
which at one time housed the abode of a witch that
had long collapsed. Waiting for nightfall, you

00:10:12.065 --> 00:10:19.328
approached the center of the grove that existed there on the
island and found near this ruin this same fiendish

00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:27.298
nergaliid, as well as Toya, the 12-year-old dwarf
girl who had been affixed to him for the

00:10:27.298 --> 00:10:34.321
performances in the carnival. You did battle with
this large fiendish entity who summoned a cluster

00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:41.509
of imps and managed to knock a few of you pretty
heavily to the ground before you finished it off.

00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:50.171
We left off as you all were finishing licking your
wounds, catching your breath, and now as the

00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:59.340
moonlit night gets its darkest in the sky, you
figure out what the next step is in gathering means

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:07.318
of absolving yourselves of suspicion. As you've
all now taken a moment to yourselves, you can hear

00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:12.717
the sound of the nearby crickets getting more and
more deafening as the silence crawls over the

00:11:12.717 --> 00:11:20.195
center of the lake. Toya, the young girl, still
lies unconscious. The remains of the devil toad,

00:11:20.195 --> 00:11:27.821
still partially burnt from the final blow
delivered by Fjord, are mostly intact above its

00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:33.271
shoulders, head, and its legs. What would you like
to do?

00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:39.219
TRAVIS: Ow. We're all fucked up.

00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:41.408
LAURA: Does anybody need any healing?

00:11:41.408 --> 00:11:44.262
SAM: Oh, are you alive right now?

00:11:44.262 --> 00:11:48.063
TRAVIS: We're up. Just barely.

00:11:48.063 --> 00:11:49.970
LAURA: You need some?

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.195
LIAM: I'm really shabby at the moment.

00:11:52.195 --> 00:11:54.543
LAURA: Oh, that's too bad because I don't have any
spells left.

00:11:54.543 --> 00:11:58.710
LIAM: That's good. Let's go back and talk to the
cops.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.048
LAURA: Should we do something with this body?

00:12:01.048 --> 00:12:04.134
TALIESIN: I think we need to bring it. I think we're
going to need a trophy.

00:12:04.134 --> 00:12:06.030
LIAM: What about just its head?

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.214
TALIESIN: That'll do.

00:12:07.214 --> 00:12:11.029
TRAVIS: It's a big head. It might be all we can
take.

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:15.460
LAURA: I don't know if it'll fit on the boat.
Would it fit on the boat that we came out on?

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.162
MATT: How much of the body?

00:12:18.162 --> 00:12:19.409
LAURA: The whole body.

00:12:19.409 --> 00:12:28.854
MATT: The whole body with all of you could
probably fit. It doesn't have the usual-- you

00:12:28.854 --> 00:12:30.733
could probably fit it.

00:12:30.733 --> 00:12:32.099
SAM: How about just the head?

00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:35.832
MATT: The head it would probably do, but the full
body, I'd have to make a few rolls.

00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:38.508
TALIESIN: I'm going to give the body a quick
search to see if there's anything.

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.201
MATT: You already did.

00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:41.984
LAURA: Yeah, I got a bunch of rings. See?

00:12:41.984 --> 00:12:44.311
TALIESIN: Do I recognize any of these rings?

00:12:44.311 --> 00:12:45.857
MATT: No, you do not.

00:12:45.857 --> 00:12:48.238
TALIESIN: All right. That's disturbing.

00:12:48.238 --> 00:12:49.739
SAM: I got one, too.

00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:56.715
TRAVIS: Has the head been damaged at all, or is it
mostly intact?

00:12:56.715 --> 00:13:01.721
MATT: It's mostly intact. There are a few gashes
on it from the general fray, but for the most part

00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:03.519
it's still a solid head.

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:09.440
TRAVIS: Molly, you've got them impressive swords.
You want to do some hacking?

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.268
TALIESIN: Suppose I should.

00:13:13.268 --> 00:13:16.404
MARISHA: I'd say you have a pretty impressive
sword, too.

00:13:16.404 --> 00:13:20.932
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and carve off the head.

00:13:20.932 --> 00:13:28.818
MATT: Okay. It's a tough form. Not only is the
exterior of its flesh blubbery and a heavy

00:13:28.818 --> 00:13:35.506
rubber-like substance that is glistening with
whatever mucus-like liquid it naturally produces,

00:13:35.506 --> 00:13:40.515
but then beneath it, the muscle sinew is extremely
tough. It takes you the better part of 20 minutes

00:13:40.515 --> 00:13:46.085
to finally get the head entirely off the rest of
the torso. It weighs enough to the point where

00:13:46.085 --> 00:13:48.801
you're going to need one or two other hands to get
it anywhere.

00:13:48.801 --> 00:13:50.832
TRAVIS: That's an artiste at work right there.

00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:54.636
TALIESIN: This is as far as I go one this one.
That's way too heavy for me.

00:13:54.636 --> 00:13:56.299
LIAM: It's all you, blue.

00:13:56.299 --> 00:13:58.122
MARISHA: I'll help you out.

00:13:58.122 --> 00:13:59.296
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab Toya.

00:13:59.296 --> 00:14:00.464
LAURA and MARISHA: (groaning)

00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:01.955
LAURA: Is Toya waking up at all?

00:14:01.955 --> 00:14:05.434
MATT: Toya is passed out. You'd have to try and
rouse her.

00:14:05.434 --> 00:14:08.859
LAURA: It's probably best not to wake her up while
we're carrying this head around.

00:14:08.859 --> 00:14:10.665
TALIESIN: I think that's a very good idea.

00:14:10.665 --> 00:14:12.123
MARISHA: Yeah, this is frightening.

00:14:12.123 --> 00:14:15.808
LIAM: The imps burned away?

00:14:15.808 --> 00:14:17.672
MATT: Yes, they turned to ash.

00:14:17.672 --> 00:14:19.455
LAURA: Does he have hair? What are we carrying him
by?

00:14:19.455 --> 00:14:21.002
MARISHA: Yeah, what are we carrying him by?

00:14:21.002 --> 00:14:32.462
MATT: Along the brow line there are these small
holes that could be breathing holes. You'd have to

00:14:32.462 --> 00:14:35.661
carry it from there, under the socket, or under
the jaw.

00:14:35.661 --> 00:14:37.692
LIAM: Because that's what you want to stick your
finger in.

00:14:37.692 --> 00:14:39.882
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally. The mucus hole.

00:14:39.882 --> 00:14:44.886
MARISHA: I grab the jaw and I say: "Hey, Jester."

00:14:44.886 --> 00:14:54.007
TALIESIN: I did share meals with this person for
two straight years. Never mind. I'm walking away.

00:14:54.007 --> 00:14:56.269
TRAVIS: We are fucking with his old co-worker.

00:14:56.269 --> 00:15:01.188
TALIESIN: I'm already walking away. I took the kid
and am walking to the boat.

00:15:01.188 --> 00:15:03.599
LAURA, MARISHA and TRAVIS: Sorry!

00:15:03.599 --> 00:15:08.156
LIAM: Caleb just retched into the grass from
watching that.

00:15:08.156 --> 00:15:11.840
LAURA: All right, let's carry him.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.910
TALIESIN: You're the worst. You're all the worst.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:19.392
LAURA: Fjord, I gave you the bag of skin. Don't
forget you have that.

00:15:19.392 --> 00:15:20.452
TRAVIS: I have it?

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:21.707
LAURA: You have the bag of slimy skin.

00:15:21.707 --> 00:15:27.332
TRAVIS: I'm going to salt it and hang it out to
dry.

00:15:27.332 --> 00:15:31.952
LIAM: If it will help tomorrow or today-- what
time is it? It's the middle of the night, isn't it?

00:15:31.952 --> 00:15:40.211
MATT: You approached just after dusk, so between
the slow moving in there, the combat, and the rest

00:15:40.211 --> 00:15:42.472
afterward it's probably close to 10:00PM.

00:15:42.472 --> 00:15:45.197
LIAM: I know exactly what time it is, don't I?
Yeah.

00:15:45.197 --> 00:15:53.113
TRAVIS: You know exactly what time it is?

00:15:53.113 --> 00:16:00.842
LIAM: It's something I've always been able to--
why is everybody looking at me like-- (vomiting sound)

00:16:00.842 --> 00:16:04.498
LAURA: Where's Frumpkin?

00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:06.595
LIAM: (fwoosh)

00:16:06.595 --> 00:16:09.331
LAURA: Oh, good.

00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:13.386
MATT: At this point, Molly, as you're ahead of the
group and you're making your way through the

00:16:13.386 --> 00:16:23.728
trees, Toya begins to stir in your grasp. Her eyes
open a bit as you're holding her and she looks up

00:16:23.728 --> 00:16:31.620
at you, confused, eyes lolling around in the
sockets for a moment before they see you and

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.509
clarify. "Molly?"

00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:39.160
TALIESIN: I know, dear. You've been through a bit.
There's been some bad business.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.475
MATT: "What happened?"

00:16:40.475 --> 00:16:47.257
TALIESIN: (sighs) A friend turned on us, but it's
going to be all right. I'm going to get you home,

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:48.704
all right?

00:16:48.704 --> 00:16:56.363
MATT: "Wait, where's Kylre?" She starts trying to
fight your grasp.

00:16:56.363 --> 00:17:00.887
TALIESIN: I'll explain it later.

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:04.856
MATT: She's going to try and break free of your
grasp. Are you going to attempt to hold onto her?

00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:05.802
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

00:17:05.802 --> 00:17:07.471
LIAM: How far away are they from the rest of us?

00:17:07.471 --> 00:17:11.745
MATT: While you guys have been doing all this,
he's gone on ahead. He's probably a good 40 to 50

00:17:11.745 --> 00:17:18.486
feet ahead. Go ahead and roll an athletics check.

00:17:18.486 --> 00:17:20.179
TALIESIN: You're a monster.

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:25.045
LAURA: Oh, no!

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.580
TRAVIS: Tell me you did it.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.732
TALIESIN: No, it's not that bad.

00:17:29.732 --> 00:17:37.765
LAURA: Oh, it looked like a one from this angle.
Still pretty terrible.

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:43.636
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (chanting) Level two.

00:17:43.636 --> 00:17:48.448
LAURA: You were rolling bad on this the last game.
You need to stop rolling that one.

00:17:48.448 --> 00:17:50.470
MATT: Yeah, that dice needs to go away.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.450
TALIESIN: I've got some new stuff coming in.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.184
LAURA: All right.

00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:59.324
MARISHA: It's coming across the border. It's real
good.

00:17:59.324 --> 00:18:01.720
TALIESIN: Coming in from the Feywild.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.754
MATT: You can choose athletics or acrobatics.

00:18:04.754 --> 00:18:07.692
TALIESIN: Oh. Can I reroll?

00:18:07.692 --> 00:18:08.903
MATT: No.

00:18:08.903 --> 00:18:10.515
TALIESIN: Then that's nine.

00:18:10.515 --> 00:18:16.991
MATT: That still beats her. She rolled a five. All
right, wanted to double-check. She's scrambling

00:18:16.991 --> 00:18:21.397
and as you pull her back she tries to fight for a
second and then goes limp in your grasp and goes,

00:18:21.397 --> 00:18:23.940
"I'm scared."

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:30.329
TALIESIN: I know. It's going to be a bit rough,
but it was for the best. I'm so sorry. Some people

00:18:30.329 --> 00:18:32.089
just turn, I'm so sorry.

00:18:32.089 --> 00:18:33.734
MATT: "What happened?"

00:18:33.734 --> 00:18:40.897
TALIESIN: He got sick. There was something inside
him. There was something that made him

00:18:40.897 --> 00:18:44.761
do some bad things, but it had to be taken care
of. You're going to be all right.

00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:56.411
MATT: She gets really quiet for a second. You get
to the boat and the gentleman earlier that you had

00:18:56.411 --> 00:19:01.749
passed the wine off to is sitting there waiting.
He has a small pouch that's opened with some dried

00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:08.053
meat that he's chewing on as he's waiting. As you guys
walk up, he says: "Oh, I see you've finished."

00:19:08.053 --> 00:19:10.612
LAURA and MARISHA: (groaning)

00:19:10.612 --> 00:19:12.850
MATT: (shouting) "What in the hell is that?!"

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.214
MARISHA: Move!

00:19:14.214 --> 00:19:17.218
LAURA: We told you we were having a party, man!

00:19:17.218 --> 00:19:23.420
LIAM: I was just about to suggest covering that
up, but you know, all cards on the table.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:29.729
MATT: He grabs his bag of dried meat, pulls it up,
and backs up. "I didn't know-- What is that? What

00:19:29.729 --> 00:19:32.590
"did you do? What is that?"

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.291
MARISHA: I said we were going to be doing some
frog digging.

00:19:35.291 --> 00:19:38.364
TALIESIN: Biggest frog you've ever seen.

00:19:38.364 --> 00:19:50.124
MATT: There's a pause before this tiny screeching
sound begins to emit from Toya. This high pitched

00:19:50.124 --> 00:19:55.251
and barely audible squeak as Toya begins to
&lt;i&gt;scream&lt;/i&gt;.

00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:58.164
LAURA: I take off my cloak and I cover the head
with it.

00:19:58.164 --> 00:20:02.463
TALIESIN: I was trying to keep her away from
that.

00:20:02.463 --> 00:20:04.631
MATT: It's hard to keep her away from &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.

00:20:04.631 --> 00:20:16.958
TRAVIS: We literally cut the head off Barney and
shoved it in her face. (singsong) I love you.

00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:26.033
TALIESIN: The Barney that been raising her, yes.
Really take that in. Off to a great start.

00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:30.214
MATT: After Jester throws her cloak over Toya--

00:20:30.214 --> 00:20:32.674
LAURA: No, not Toya. Over the head.

00:20:32.674 --> 00:20:37.458
TALIESIN: I'm trying to keep her quiet.

00:20:37.458 --> 00:20:41.828
MATT: She's sobbing into your arms at this point.
You feel her body shaking against your grasp.

00:20:41.828 --> 00:20:46.299
LAURA: I feel so bad.

00:20:46.299 --> 00:20:48.088
TALIESIN: You should.

00:20:48.088 --> 00:20:50.097
SAM: Poor girl.

00:20:50.097 --> 00:20:54.569
TALIESIN: I'm going to take her to the front of
the boat and keep her far away from all that.

00:20:54.569 --> 00:21:02.530
LIAM: I pull Fjord away for a moment, about ten or
15 feet away. This man in the boat has seen all of

00:21:02.585 --> 00:21:07.352
you who are supposed to be under house arrest. We
cannot have him talking to the authorities.

00:21:07.352 --> 00:21:08.796
SAM: Should we kill him?

00:21:08.796 --> 00:21:12.780
LIAM: Jeez! Come here.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.280
TRAVIS: I have a good feeling that this guy is a
man of upstanding nature. I'm sure he'll keep it

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.515
to himself.

00:21:19.515 --> 00:21:20.670
LIAM: Oh, that's very trusting.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:21.617
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course.

00:21:21.617 --> 00:21:23.915
SAM: We gave him one bottle of wine. That's not
very much.

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:26.202
TRAVIS: We have another bottle. Don't we?

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.622
MARISHA: Yes?

00:21:28.622 --> 00:21:31.589
LIAM: Oh, you're here too, now. Great, it's a party.

00:21:31.589 --> 00:21:40.003
MARISHA: We could also toss him a bit of gold if
we think it would make him forget the night.

00:21:40.003 --> 00:21:44.753
TRAVIS: After all, we came to him, right? I would
prefer not to use any violence.

00:21:44.753 --> 00:21:48.934
LIAM: I'm not suggesting that, but it's either
violence or giving him a little something.

00:21:48.934 --> 00:21:51.955
MARISHA: What makes you think he's going to go
talk to the authorities?

00:21:51.955 --> 00:21:53.490
LIAM: You want to leave it to chance?

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:54.854
MARISHA: Who cares?

00:21:54.854 --> 00:22:00.248
SAM: This is a small town, Beau. Everyone talks to
everyone. You taught us that.

00:22:00.248 --> 00:22:03.367
MARISHA: I did, but everyone also hated the
circus.

00:22:03.367 --> 00:22:06.886
LIAM: Molly, do you want to join this
conversation?

00:22:06.886 --> 00:22:13.115
TALIESIN: I've been listening. I pull out a gold
coin. Give him this.

00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:16.565
LAURA: Maybe one more. Or two more.

00:22:16.565 --> 00:22:18.477
MARISHA: I pull two out as well.

00:22:18.477 --> 00:22:20.232
LAURA: I'll pull three out.

00:22:20.232 --> 00:22:26.916
MATT: He's recessed to the very back of his boat,
wide-eyed as you approach.

00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:31.212
TRAVIS: You're right. Coin is a good idea.

00:22:31.212 --> 00:22:33.720
LAURA: Go charm him, Fjord. You're very charming.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.112
MARISHA: You've got fisherman vibes.

00:22:37.112 --> 00:22:41.074
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Wait a minute. How long did that
fight take?

00:22:41.074 --> 00:22:45.527
MATT: You've returned to your normal half-orc
form.

00:22:45.527 --> 00:22:50.858
TRAVIS: Oh, cool. Okay. There was an old man who
was with us before.

00:22:50.858 --> 00:22:54.010
TALIESIN: And now there's a little girl. It's all
coming full circle.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.301
TRAVIS: Maybe we give him the extra bottle of wine
and &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; go talk to him.

00:22:57.301 --> 00:23:00.309
LIAM: Walking up to the boat--

00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:03.708
MARISHA: Here. (clink)

00:23:03.708 --> 00:23:09.763
LIAM: Collecting it as I go. The thing of it is,
we've just done Trostenwald-- what was that?

00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:21.642
Never mind. --a great service. There was an unsavory element--
did you know the circus was in town?

00:23:21.642 --> 00:23:32.852
Doesn't matter. There was a bad fellow-- that's his head--
with them. It's no fault of theirs. You pick weird folk up on the

00:23:32.852 --> 00:23:34.855
road in the circus. Isn't that right, Mollymauk?

00:23:34.855 --> 00:23:36.348
TALIESIN: I'll let that go.

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:40.291
MATT: He reaches over, grabs the oar from the
side, and lifts the cloak off the face.

00:23:40.291 --> 00:23:45.982
LIAM: That's going to rile you up. That's a bad
idea.

00:23:45.982 --> 00:23:48.868
MATT: "It doesn't look like a savory creature."

00:23:48.868 --> 00:23:51.809
LAURA: It wasn't. Trust us.

00:23:51.809 --> 00:23:54.505
TALIESIN: Took a lot out of us.

00:23:54.505 --> 00:24:03.581
LIAM: But the situation in town is a little
political. We're going to take this thing out of

00:24:03.581 --> 00:24:10.511
here and I'm going to report it to the
authorities. We don't really want to create a stir

00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:13.963
and frighten people here. I hope you will take--

00:24:13.963 --> 00:24:20.520
LAURA: We like to be unsung heroes. You know, like
superheroes with secret identities.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.273
MARISHA: Yeah, we're an underground anonymous
activist group.

00:24:24.273 --> 00:24:30.604
LAURA: Yeah, that helps people. But if everyone
knows who we are, it'll be much harder to fight

00:24:30.604 --> 00:24:31.806
all the crime.

00:24:31.806 --> 00:24:33.672
LIAM: Try to focus on the gold.

00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:45.266
MATT: He slowly reaches out and takes it from your
hand. "All right. I trust it was a bad thing. So

00:24:45.266 --> 00:24:52.148
"I'm going to take you back, and then you promise
I'll never see you again?"

00:24:52.148 --> 00:24:56.507
LAURA: We'll try really hard to not let you see
us.

00:24:56.507 --> 00:24:58.097
TALIESIN: If you see us, we won't make eye
contact.

00:24:58.097 --> 00:24:59.938
LAURA: We'll pretend we don't know you.

00:24:59.938 --> 00:25:02.373
MATT: "That includes the goblin."

00:25:02.373 --> 00:25:06.759
SAM: I was never here. We never had this
conversation.

00:25:06.759 --> 00:25:08.509
LAURA: She's a halfling.

00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:12.089
MATT: He glances over and takes a closer look.

00:25:12.089 --> 00:25:15.611
SAM: I'm very ugly for a halfling.

00:25:15.611 --> 00:25:23.324
MATT: "Let's just get back to shore." He grabs the
oar, takes the bottle of wine that he had mostly

00:25:23.324 --> 00:25:27.568
drunk by himself before, and polishes it off in
one series of gulps.

00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:30.742
LAURA: Don't boat drunk.

00:25:30.742 --> 00:25:37.746
MATT: As you all gather up onto the ship, he
begins to paddle you back towards the western

00:25:37.746 --> 00:25:41.116
shore of the Ustaloch to the outskirts of
Trostenwald.

00:25:41.116 --> 00:25:46.711
MARISHA: When we get to the shore, we should
probably split up.

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:50.680
LAURA: How are we going to get this giant head to
the authorities?

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.017
MARISHA: That's a good question.

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:57.172
LAURA: Oh, I got an idea! Why don't you go get a
wagon as soon as we get to shore, and we'll help

00:25:57.172 --> 00:26:00.636
you load it onto the wagon, and then you just take
it on in yourself.

00:26:00.636 --> 00:26:03.722
TALIESIN: It's a shame we didn't just get rid of a
wagon not more than one night ago.

00:26:03.722 --> 00:26:09.771
SAM: Why do we need to take it with us? Us
traipsing through town with a giant head seems

00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:14.508
like it would draw focus. Why don't we just put it
somewhere and send the authorities out here to

00:26:14.508 --> 00:26:15.736
find it later?

00:26:15.736 --> 00:26:17.817
TALIESIN: Someone else may get to it, or something
might happen.

00:26:17.817 --> 00:26:19.509
SAM: What are they going to do with it? It's a big
head!

00:26:19.509 --> 00:26:21.500
MARISHA: We could leave someone with it, and we
can just--

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.178
TRAVIS: I could stand guard as a crownsguard next
to it.

00:26:25.178 --> 00:26:27.786
TALIESIN: What could people do with the head of a
creature like this?

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:32.498
MATT: What could people do with the head of a
creature like this? Who knows.

00:26:32.498 --> 00:26:33.690
TALIESIN: Would I know?

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.473
LAURA: They could make a lot of soup.

00:26:35.473 --> 00:26:42.155
MATT: They could turn it in for-- there's a lot of
poor folk here. If they had a large looking odd

00:26:42.155 --> 00:26:44.473
creature, that's worth some gold.

00:26:44.473 --> 00:26:47.428
SAM: We can hide it. Maybe some of us have skills
to hide things.

00:26:47.428 --> 00:26:52.857
LIAM: I think Fjord had a good idea, which is if
you can disguise yourself as a crownsguard again,

00:26:52.857 --> 00:26:55.907
you wait with it. You guys get back to the tavern,
yeah?

00:26:55.907 --> 00:26:57.761
MARISHA: You can go and alert the authorities.

00:26:57.761 --> 00:27:02.825
LIAM: Now, here's the thing. I may be speaking out
of turn-- I know I don't know you very well, but

00:27:02.825 --> 00:27:10.522
it feels like the thing that we all share in
common here is that we don't wish to make-- maybe

00:27:10.522 --> 00:27:14.010
not you-- make a big splash here.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.122
TRAVIS: Agreed. The less attention, the better.

00:27:16.122 --> 00:27:17.950
LAURA: Well, you know, whatever.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.292
TRAVIS: The less attention, the better.

00:27:20.292 --> 00:27:22.119
TALIESIN: For the moment.

00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:27.700
LIAM: Okay, so maybe I'm 70 to 80 percent correct,
but we're all in this together.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.080
MARISHA: And gold. I like getting paid.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.201
TALIESIN: We need to get this one back to the
circus, too. You might be helpful for that.

00:27:36.201 --> 00:27:45.515
LIAM: I don't want to make a big thing. I'm going
to go the authorities, to-- my keen mind tells me

00:27:45.515 --> 00:27:47.458
that woman's name was--?

00:27:47.458 --> 00:27:49.758
MATT: Oh, the-- sorry.

00:27:49.758 --> 00:27:51.435
LIAM: Yeah, the one who wanted to go eat.

00:27:51.435 --> 00:27:52.433
MATT: Yes, you're talking about--

00:27:52.433 --> 00:27:53.374
TRAVIS: Norda?

00:27:53.374 --> 00:27:55.600
MATT: Yes, Lawmaster Norda.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:07.846
LIAM: Norda? I want to go to her and citizen's
arrest kind of thing. Keep it quiet, don't need

00:28:07.846 --> 00:28:14.920
big accolades, will take gold, and then I'll bring
that back and we can divvy that up. That's no problem.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:20.082
TRAVIS: I like it. As soon as other crownsguard
arrive with Norda and the rest of whoever you

00:28:20.082 --> 00:28:23.223
bring to the scene, maybe I can go with you and
help return Toya.

00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:27.795
LAURA: You disappear quickly, because if you get
drawn into that investigation, it would be bad.

00:28:27.795 --> 00:28:33.595
LIAM: Right, and if nobody recognizes you-- Do you
remember any of the guards that were in town that

00:28:33.595 --> 00:28:36.214
you could make yourself look like specifically?

00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:37.440
LAURA: Oh!

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.773
MARISHA: What was that guy's name?

00:28:38.773 --> 00:28:41.148
LAURA: What were the two guards that keep coming
to the tavern?

00:28:41.148 --> 00:28:42.754
MARISHA: Oh, wait!

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:44.893
LAURA: We wrote their names down.

00:28:44.893 --> 00:28:46.135
MARISHA: Jonas and Lucas.

00:28:46.135 --> 00:28:47.434
LAURA: That's right!

00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:50.129
SAM and MARISHA: The Jonas Brothers.

00:28:50.129 --> 00:28:53.712
MATT: They're not related at all.

00:28:53.712 --> 00:29:01.779
LIAM: DM, question. The two zombified back at the
circus tents, were they burnt to a crisp beyond

00:29:01.779 --> 00:29:02.832
recognition?

00:29:02.832 --> 00:29:05.499
MATT: One of them was, and they have been
discovered.

00:29:05.499 --> 00:29:12.079
LIAM: Yeah, but was he recognizable? Did we leave
him looking like that dude at the end of The Last

00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:14.510
Crusade after he drank from the wrong cup?

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:19.823
MATT: With some time, he could be identified.

00:29:19.823 --> 00:29:23.520
LIAM: Okay. Well, the Jonas Brothers it is,
friends.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:34.005
SAM: Just to game this out. You, Caleb, someone
who is not suspected of a crime, is going to bring

00:29:34.005 --> 00:29:37.768
the severed head of a member of the circus to the
police--

00:29:37.768 --> 00:29:40.425
LAURA: No, he's going to go to the police and
bring them to the head.

00:29:40.425 --> 00:29:47.255
SAM: Either way. You, Caleb, someone who is not
suspected of a crime, is going to point the police

00:29:47.255 --> 00:29:53.167
to the severed head of a member of the circus with
no evidence showing what that thing was or that it

00:29:53.167 --> 00:30:01.836
was evil, and that will somehow not implicate
other people who were not with us at the time. How

00:30:01.836 --> 00:30:04.805
is this going to prove their innocence, just
showing a head?

00:30:04.805 --> 00:30:10.137
LIAM: They already believe that the circus is
terrible. I think they were just going to confirm

00:30:10.137 --> 00:30:11.536
their own suspicions.

00:30:11.536 --> 00:30:22.185
MARISHA: Also, Toya. If she would speak honestly,
she would absolve all of us.

00:30:22.185 --> 00:30:27.691
TRAVIS: I think Beau makes a very good point.
Without Toya's testimony we're in trouble.

00:30:27.691 --> 00:30:29.549
TALIESIN: I'm hoping Toya will--

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:35.581
LIAM: Well, that's a sticky situation. Because
what if she talks about my friends who were there

00:30:35.581 --> 00:30:36.952
with me?

00:30:36.952 --> 00:30:40.773
TALIESIN: She knows what to say when guards are
asking questions.

00:30:40.773 --> 00:30:43.593
LIAM: It looks like she knows how to go off like a
siren.

00:30:43.593 --> 00:30:45.369
TALIESIN: She's had a bad night.

00:30:45.369 --> 00:30:48.353
LIAM: I'm at one hit point, I understand.

00:30:48.353 --> 00:30:57.917
TALIESIN: We'll have a talk. We'll get her to some
people who can calm her down and make sure she

00:30:57.917 --> 00:31:00.098
remembers how we take care of each other.

00:31:00.098 --> 00:31:05.510
MATT: "If there's something you want to ask me,
I'm right here." You're all in this boat as it

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.520
makes its way across the Ustaloch.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.111
TALIESIN: Sorry, dear. I was hoping that we didn't
have to have this conversation in front of strangers.

00:31:12.111 --> 00:31:14.483
MATT: "Can someone please explain to me what's
going on?"

00:31:14.483 --> 00:31:22.295
LIAM: Can you explain to us, maybe, your
relationship with Kylre? If that was his name.

00:31:22.295 --> 00:31:29.194
MATT: "I mean, that's the name I've ever known."

00:31:29.194 --> 00:31:31.526
LIAM: Let's talk about the killing part, though.

00:31:31.526 --> 00:31:41.283
MATT: "I don't know anything about that. When we
did the show the other night, the horrible man--"

00:31:41.283 --> 00:31:47.448
TALIESIN: It turns out that that was-- Kylre did
that.

00:31:47.448 --> 00:31:49.272
MATT: "Why?"

00:31:49.272 --> 00:31:56.026
TALIESIN: I don't know why. Something snapped.
He's hurt and killed a lot of people. We think

00:31:56.026 --> 00:31:58.480
that maybe he's been making you sick too.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.515
LAURA: Have you ever heard him say nergaliid?

00:32:01.515 --> 00:32:05.906
MATT: "No. Where's Gustav?"

00:32:05.906 --> 00:32:11.670
TALIESIN: Gustav is having trouble with the
authorities. We're going to need to all work

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.537
together to save him.

00:32:13.537 --> 00:32:18.497
TRAVIS: Unfortunately, the authorities think that
Gustav and the circus are responsible for what

00:32:18.497 --> 00:32:25.023
happened. Actually, it's just Kylre. He wasn't
what you thought he was, I'm afraid.

00:32:25.023 --> 00:32:30.568
TALIESIN: The twins are being the twins, Ornna's
being Ornna. But I think we can save everybody. We

00:32:30.568 --> 00:32:33.735
just need to take care of each other.

00:32:33.735 --> 00:32:36.550
MATT: "He was my friend, though."

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:41.502
LIAM: Child, how did you grow so close to him?

00:32:41.502 --> 00:32:56.175
MATT: "Gustav put us together for our act and he
protected me. I felt safe around him. He didn't

00:32:56.175 --> 00:32:59.791
"let anybody get too close I didn't want to."

00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:02.310
LIAM: Did he communicate with you in some way?

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.109
MATT: "He talked."

00:33:04.109 --> 00:33:05.592
LIAM: What did you talk about?

00:33:05.592 --> 00:33:16.277
MATT: "Well, we talked about everybody else in the
family. We talked about how I missed not having a

00:33:16.277 --> 00:33:22.352
"family. He didn't talk about himself much, but it
was mainly just little games."

00:33:22.352 --> 00:33:26.182
LAURA: Did he teach you how to sing to affect
people's minds?

00:33:26.182 --> 00:33:33.189
MATT: "No. That was how I got by before I met
these guys."

00:33:33.189 --> 00:33:43.247
LIAM: I am sure this is painful for you. You are
young. Sometimes people we feel we know can be

00:33:43.247 --> 00:33:54.791
someone else. Regrettably, this is one of those
instances. He was a dangerous thing. It is very

00:33:54.791 --> 00:34:03.649
important that this is buried here. You want to
travel on with the circus and with Mollymauk and

00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:12.196
your friends. That thing tried to kill us. It did
kill things in Trostenwald. Who knows what it

00:34:12.196 --> 00:34:15.668
would have done to you, child?

00:34:15.668 --> 00:34:18.796
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:34:18.796 --> 00:34:24.305
LIAM: Oof.

00:34:24.305 --> 00:34:25.820
SAM: It's good.

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.595
LIAM: No, it's not good.

00:34:27.595 --> 00:34:29.323
TALIESIN: I felt it.

00:34:29.323 --> 00:34:31.141
TRAVIS: It's Sam good.

00:34:31.141 --> 00:34:34.593
LIAM: It is only a six. Rolled very low.

00:34:34.593 --> 00:34:40.596
MATT: As you're talking to her, her eyes keep
flickering off of your face and over towards Beau.

00:34:40.596 --> 00:34:46.002
You watch her curl back into herself and get
quiet.

00:34:46.002 --> 00:34:52.511
TRAVIS: It might do for you to apologize.

00:34:52.511 --> 00:34:57.862
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:02.313
LAURA: Sorry for what, Beau?

00:35:02.313 --> 00:35:04.363
MARISHA: Really, Jester?

00:35:04.363 --> 00:35:05.525
LAURA: Really.

00:35:05.525 --> 00:35:07.014
TALIESIN: No, I want to hear this too.

00:35:07.014 --> 00:35:13.824
MARISHA: Sorry for choking you with my stick.

00:35:13.824 --> 00:35:18.465
TALIESIN: Somehow that was better than what I was
hoping for.

00:35:18.465 --> 00:35:20.561
LIAM: Rated T for Teen.

00:35:20.561 --> 00:35:26.776
SAM: And I'll never do it again?

00:35:26.776 --> 00:35:35.580
(laughter)

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:45.613
MARISHA: And I'll never do it again. As long as
you don't try that again, of course, I guess.

00:35:45.613 --> 00:35:54.163
LAURA: It was only because Kylre was trying to
kill us and she was afraid that you were helping him.

00:35:54.163 --> 00:35:58.396
MARISHA: Yeah, I wasn't trying to hurt you. I was
just trying to get you to stop singing. But it was

00:35:58.396 --> 00:36:01.007
so abrasive.

00:36:01.007 --> 00:36:05.281
TALIESIN: You know how people outside can be. The
mean girl was just afraid of you and we're going

00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:08.004
to let her go on this one.

00:36:08.004 --> 00:36:09.569
MATT: "I'm tired."

00:36:09.569 --> 00:36:11.227
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. Let's get you home, okay?

00:36:11.227 --> 00:36:15.035
MATT: She leans into you, Molly. After a few
minutes, she falls asleep against you.

00:36:15.035 --> 00:36:17.129
LAURA: That went well, I think.

00:36:17.129 --> 00:36:19.730
TALIESIN: Choked you with my stick?!

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:21.334
MARISHA: I did.

00:36:21.334 --> 00:36:25.042
LAURA: She apologized for exactly what she did.

00:36:25.042 --> 00:36:28.241
TALIESIN: That was certainly memorable.

00:36:28.241 --> 00:36:38.830
MATT: "All right, we're here." The boat hits the
edge of the dock. He hops off and pulls the rope

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:44.201
up. Slowly manages the boat over to the side of the
dock, ties it up.

00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:47.504
LAURA: How many people are around the dock right
now?

00:36:47.504 --> 00:36:52.286
MATT: There's no boats at the dock that are being
manned currently. There are a few boats out on the

00:36:52.286 --> 00:36:57.754
water that you saw in the distance. There are some
night fishermen. There's nobody immediately in the

00:36:57.754 --> 00:36:58.811
vicinity.

00:36:58.811 --> 00:37:03.920
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm going to hop off the boat and
break eye contact with the captain of the boat so

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.403
that I can Disguise Self into a crownsguard.

00:37:08.403 --> 00:37:12.863
LIAM: I talk to him while you do that. You have
your wine, you have your gold. Thank you very

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:17.742
much, it is much appreciated. It was a lovely
trip.

00:37:17.742 --> 00:37:25.122
MATT: "Yes that's fine. Just, please, get out of
my boat."

00:37:25.122 --> 00:37:30.991
TRAVIS: (English accent) Who goes there? What is
this, what have you brought?

00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:34.809
LIAM: Oh, I have felled a beast.

00:37:34.809 --> 00:37:39.329
MATT: "They got in my boat. I-- they--"

00:37:39.329 --> 00:37:41.736
TRAVIS: Are you responsible for this?

00:37:41.736 --> 00:37:48.037
MATT: "No. They took over my boat and forced me to
take them to the middle island there."

00:37:48.037 --> 00:37:53.658
LIAM: You will not take credit for my kill. I have
killed this thing and I want it to be watched. I

00:37:53.658 --> 00:37:57.632
am going to the authorities. We will bring them
back and get this sorted.

00:37:57.632 --> 00:38:01.772
TRAVIS: It's a horrifying-looking creature. You
are to be commended for your bravery. Lawmaster

00:38:01.772 --> 00:38:04.576
Norda will want to know about this immediately.

00:38:04.576 --> 00:38:06.333
LAURA: You weren't here.

00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:08.653
MATT: Make a deception check with advantage.

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:10.918
TALIESIN: This is so weird.

00:38:10.918 --> 00:38:15.511
LAURA: I'm just holding a bowling ball.

00:38:15.511 --> 00:38:18.773
TRAVIS: 21. No, 20.

00:38:18.773 --> 00:38:27.820
MATT: He goes, "I want nothing to do with this.
Good night." He helps each of you quickly get off

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:32.218
the boat. Ties and locks it up and makes a
beeline--

00:38:32.218 --> 00:38:35.282
SAM: (shouting) We'll come to your house with your
share of the reward.

00:38:35.282 --> 00:38:38.904
(laughter)

00:38:38.904 --> 00:38:42.613
TRAVIS: All right, we can't waste any time.

00:38:42.613 --> 00:38:45.403
LAURA: Can I lob the head up over the side of the
boat?

00:38:45.403 --> 00:38:47.509
MATT: Make a strength check.

00:38:47.509 --> 00:38:49.620
LIAM: Monster calves.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.869
LAURA: Oh no.

00:38:50.869 --> 00:38:52.229
SAM: You're strong, though.

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:53.448
TALIESIN: Are you?

00:38:53.448 --> 00:38:56.005
LIAM: Yeah, but at level two you need to roll
higher than a three.

00:38:56.005 --> 00:38:57.742
LAURA: Eight!

00:38:57.742 --> 00:39:04.674
MATT: You get it partway up and it begins sliding
back into the boat and plops into the boat and

00:39:04.674 --> 00:39:06.892
goes (bouncing) and you have to catch yourself.

00:39:06.892 --> 00:39:08.982
TRAVIS: Tongue and mouth just (lolling).

00:39:08.982 --> 00:39:10.698
MATT: It's terrifying.

00:39:10.698 --> 00:39:15.287
LAURA: All right, I need help. It's still covered,
don't worry. She can't see what we're doing, it's

00:39:15.287 --> 00:39:17.002
covered with my cloak.

00:39:17.002 --> 00:39:18.107
SAM: I'll help you.

00:39:18.107 --> 00:39:22.226
LAURA: By the way, it's a little tiny cloak. It's
like a half cape so it's like--

00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:25.477
TALIESIN: It's like a napkin on a buffalo.

00:39:25.477 --> 00:39:28.084
MATT: A doily on a couch.

00:39:28.084 --> 00:39:29.244
SAM: I'll help you.

00:39:29.244 --> 00:39:30.336
LAURA: It's going to squish you.

00:39:30.336 --> 00:39:34.187
SAM: That's all right, I'm strong. One, two,
three!

00:39:34.187 --> 00:39:36.658
MATT: Eventually you guys get it up onto the
dock.

00:39:36.658 --> 00:39:38.501
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:42.995
TRAVIS: Molly, do you intend to keep Toya here or
do you need to take her back?

00:39:42.995 --> 00:39:45.758
TALIESIN: Take her right back. No one can know
that she's been anywhere.

00:39:45.758 --> 00:39:50.898
LIAM: That is correct. Take her and sequester her
with the family so not a peep gets out.

00:39:50.898 --> 00:39:53.827
TALIESIN: We'll explain to her what needs to be
done.

00:39:53.827 --> 00:39:56.947
MARISHA: How do we trust you all won't skip town in
the middle of the night?

00:39:56.947 --> 00:39:59.511
TALIESIN: We still have people in the lockup.

00:39:59.511 --> 00:40:01.667
LAURA: Gustav's in jail still.

00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:03.184
MARISHA: So?

00:40:03.184 --> 00:40:04.894
LAURA: Some people are loyal.

00:40:04.894 --> 00:40:13.308
TALIESIN: I'll be back and I have to show back up
with you people anyway. I'm going to get her as

00:40:13.308 --> 00:40:14.598
quickly as possible.

00:40:14.598 --> 00:40:16.461
MATT: The rest of you guys are doing?

00:40:16.461 --> 00:40:19.747
LAURA: Who is not very stealthy here?

00:40:19.747 --> 00:40:22.095
TRAVIS: I'm keeping watch over the toad head.

00:40:22.095 --> 00:40:25.078
MARISHA: I have a plus six to my stealth.

00:40:25.078 --> 00:40:27.605
TALIESIN: I wouldn't say no to it before I take
off.

00:40:27.605 --> 00:40:33.075
LAURA: Oh that's true, you're sneaking back to the
carnival. I give you a nice little blessing.

00:40:33.075 --> 00:40:36.061
LIAM: You're going to stay with your new friend.
You can't come to--

00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:38.168
SAM: I'm not coming with you?

00:40:38.168 --> 00:40:41.266
LIAM: Not this time. It's not-- you know why.

00:40:41.266 --> 00:40:49.277
SAM: What if you're in trouble? You're very hurt.
You've had a terrible night.

00:40:49.277 --> 00:40:56.216
LIAM: If any problem should arise, I'll send
Frumpkin straight away to you.

00:40:56.216 --> 00:41:01.621
SAM: Unless you're dead. No one's going to be
around to save you if you get into trouble.

00:41:01.621 --> 00:41:03.419
LIAM: I'm almost dead already.

00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:04.712
SAM: Yeah, that's not good.

00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:06.681
LAURA: That's not comforting, Caleb.

00:41:06.681 --> 00:41:18.137
LIAM: Nott, this is what I talked to you about the
other night. These are our friends and we're going

00:41:18.137 --> 00:41:24.037
to sort this out and figure out what we do next.
It has been you and me, now it is you and me and

00:41:24.037 --> 00:41:26.634
them. Okay? You're with your blue friend here.

00:41:26.634 --> 00:41:28.859
LAURA: You can hold my hand.

00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:33.708
LIAM: I'll be back. I'm just going to have a
conversation. We have gotten out of prisons

00:41:33.708 --> 00:41:36.780
before, you and I. I'm not worried about that.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.880
SAM: Her hands are very warm.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.026
LAURA: I'm warm blooded.

00:41:43.026 --> 00:41:45.386
LIAM: Well, she was just holding the throbbing head.

00:41:45.386 --> 00:41:49.262
SAM: Oh god.

00:41:49.262 --> 00:41:51.226
LAURA: Nott, you were too.

00:41:51.226 --> 00:41:54.756
SAM: That's true. But I didn't have my fingers in
the holes.

00:41:54.756 --> 00:42:02.871
LAURA: Should I leave my cloak here over the head,
sir, good sir, guard man?

00:42:02.871 --> 00:42:08.037
TRAVIS: It's fucking me, right? We know it's still
me. I'm right here.

00:42:08.037 --> 00:42:10.929
MARIASHA: We're not RPing still?

00:42:10.929 --> 00:42:12.507
TRAVIS: No.

00:42:12.507 --> 00:42:13.999
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:15.437
TRAVIS: You can do what you want.

00:42:15.437 --> 00:42:17.083
LAURA: Should I leave my cloak here or should I
take it with me?

00:42:17.083 --> 00:42:18.868
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll make a dramatic flourish of
it.

00:42:18.868 --> 00:42:22.022
LAURA: Just make sure you bring it back home.

00:42:22.022 --> 00:42:24.409
MARISHA: I feel like the cloak is identifying to
you.

00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:28.212
TRAVIS: Take it with you, scratch that. Good
idea.

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:31.776
MARISHA: Like where did this really pretty pink
and lavender cloak come from?

00:42:31.776 --> 00:42:32.859
LAURA: It's green.

00:42:32.859 --> 00:42:35.481
MARISHA: I'm sorry, green. I haven't looked at the
art.

00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:39.246
SAM: It's nighttime, the moonlight makes
everything sort of look purple.

00:42:39.246 --> 00:42:44.059
TALIESIN: That's canon.

00:42:44.059 --> 00:42:46.936
TRAVIS: All right, go quickly.

00:42:46.936 --> 00:42:48.987
LAURA: Okay, we stealth away.

00:42:48.987 --> 00:42:50.633
TALIESIN: What is my stealth bonus now?

00:42:50.633 --> 00:42:52.018
LAURA: You just get advantage.

00:42:52.018 --> 00:42:54.710
MATT: We'll get to you in just a second. The rest
of you guys make a stealth check, please.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.422
LIAM: I don't need to cause I'm just taking a
stroll.

00:42:57.422 --> 00:42:59.029
MATT: Nope. For those of you who are--

00:42:59.029 --> 00:43:00.885
MARISHA: Ten total.

00:43:00.885 --> 00:43:03.540
MATT: That's ten.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.168
LAURA: Seven.

00:43:05.168 --> 00:43:07.840
SAM: 26.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.420
LIAM: Yep, that's my girl.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:22.161
MATT: Okay, before we get to you. As you guys make
your way back to the Nestled Nook Inn, you come to

00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:28.499
the intersection where the alleyway leads you back
to where the rope you had originally let down was

00:43:28.499 --> 00:43:35.893
placed. The rope is still there, in the darkness.
As you make your way into the alley a voice goes,

00:43:35.893 --> 00:43:42.048
"Excuse me." The three of you glance over and you
see a crownsguard at the end of the alley that's

00:43:42.048 --> 00:43:47.156
currently there with his arms crossed. "Can I help
you?"

00:43:47.156 --> 00:43:49.724
LAURA: Is our back to him still?

00:43:49.724 --> 00:43:53.838
MATT: He's to the side. You guys are all looking
up at the rope now and he's to the right of you.

00:43:53.838 --> 00:44:01.067
LAURA: Is it still dark out?

00:44:01.067 --> 00:44:04.976
MATT: Yes. It's close to midnight at this time.

00:44:04.976 --> 00:44:17.414
LAURA: Oh my god. Has anybody seen my shoe that I
dropped earlier around here?

00:44:17.414 --> 00:44:21.015
MARISHA: I immediately drop to my knees and start
looking for a shoe.

00:44:21.015 --> 00:44:23.038
TRAVIS: What, what?

00:44:23.038 --> 00:44:24.366
SAM: Did you say a shoe?

00:44:24.366 --> 00:44:27.881
MATT: I would like for you to make a-- (laughs)

00:44:27.881 --> 00:44:30.307
TRAVIS: You turned into Mr. Rogers?

00:44:30.307 --> 00:44:32.260
SAM: A shoe!?

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:37.765
MATT: I would like for you to make a deception
check, with disadvantage please.

00:44:37.765 --> 00:44:40.747
SAM: My shoe!

00:44:40.747 --> 00:44:44.412
LAURA: Eight.

00:44:44.412 --> 00:44:54.069
MATT: As Beau's on the ground frantically
searching for a shoe and Nott's there in the

00:44:54.069 --> 00:45:00.821
darkness, the guard with his arms crossed goes
(whistles). He begins to walk and approach you as

00:45:00.821 --> 00:45:05.501
two more guards close off the other side of the
alley and they begin to come up to you guys.

00:45:05.501 --> 00:45:07.169
TRAVIS: How far away are they from me? Too far?

00:45:07.169 --> 00:45:08.279
MATT: Too far.

00:45:08.279 --> 00:45:10.009
MARISHA: Drop one of those rings, drop a ring!

00:45:10.009 --> 00:45:14.820
LAURA: It's not a shoe! I drop a ring. Wait, did
we take a short rest when we were on the boat? We

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.199
did. It was a short rest on the boat.

00:45:16.199 --> 00:45:17.963
MATT: To get across, I would say I'd allow a short
rest.

00:45:17.963 --> 00:45:21.836
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Invoke Duplicity.
Behind the guard.

00:45:21.836 --> 00:45:28.269
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check to see if they
notice you suddenly casting a spell, or a

00:45:28.269 --> 00:45:29.740
spell-like effect.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.809
LAURA: Please please please. Natural 20!

00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:34.223
(cheering)

00:45:34.223 --> 00:45:41.606
MATT: Okay, so you Invoke Duplicity. Another
version of you appears behind one of three guards.

00:45:41.606 --> 00:45:42.757
What are you doing?

00:45:42.757 --> 00:45:48.309
LAURA: Oh God. Oh, she doesn't make a sound, does
she?

00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:50.647
MATT: Let's double-check this new ability that I'm
getting used to.

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.317
LAURA: I don't think she makes any noise.

00:45:52.317 --> 00:45:53.372
MARISHA: Can she tap?

00:45:53.372 --> 00:46:01.027
LAURA: But if she can cast through her, then I can
imagine she can make contact because she casts on touch.

00:46:01.027 --> 00:46:08.396
MATT: You create an illusory duplicate of
yourself. It is an illusion, it cannot make

00:46:08.396 --> 00:46:11.025
actually physical contact with anything.

00:46:11.025 --> 00:46:15.939
LAURA: Well, if she's behind one of the guards
then two of the other guards can see her.

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:17.994
MATT: Sure.

00:46:17.994 --> 00:46:20.154
SAM: We took a short rest on the thing?

00:46:20.154 --> 00:46:23.347
MATT: I'll say on the boat across the river,
sure.

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:26.010
SAM: If you want to hit dice it up.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:30.544
TRAVIS: You can roll one hit die. He's rolling
commando. He don't want it.

00:46:30.544 --> 00:46:35.858
MATT: Anyway, you Invoke Duplicity and you appear
behind him.

00:46:35.858 --> 00:46:42.149
LAURA: Yeah. My duplicate is going to jump up and
down and start flailing her arms and then run down

00:46:42.149 --> 00:46:44.037
the alley around the building.

00:46:44.037 --> 00:46:45.530
MATT: Okay.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:48.892
SAM: We have to kill these fucking guards, don't
we?

00:46:48.892 --> 00:46:50.210
MARISHA: No.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:56.024
MATT: The guard sees something quickly dart into
the shadows and continues walking towards you.

00:46:56.024 --> 00:46:57.479
LAURA: Oh, come on!

00:46:57.479 --> 00:46:59.072
MARISHA: Just go with it, go with it.

00:46:59.072 --> 00:47:01.531
LAURA: Did you see that behind you?

00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:10.972
MATT: The guard approaches and goes, "It seems
that you have been out and about when you were

00:47:10.972 --> 00:47:13.531
"supposed to be within the inn."

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:15.736
MARISHA: Found it! The ring.

00:47:15.736 --> 00:47:17.738
LAURA: That's my ring. I dropped it out the
window.

00:47:17.738 --> 00:47:20.366
SAM: She calls it a shoe, it's a shoe ring.

00:47:20.366 --> 00:47:22.869
LAURA: I like to wear them on my toes.

00:47:22.869 --> 00:47:25.732
MATT: Three more guards have now approached from
the front of the building and they approach and

00:47:25.732 --> 00:47:28.775
begin pulling out manacles and chains and say,
"We're going to have to take you to the stockade."

00:47:28.775 --> 00:47:33.842
LAURA: Oh, please don't. Really, we just left the
building because we wanted to go--

00:47:33.842 --> 00:47:35.802
MATT: You're being locked up right now, as we
speak.

00:47:35.802 --> 00:47:38.350
LAURA: This is the stupidest thing!

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.099
MARISHA: So stupid!

00:47:40.099 --> 00:47:41.560
TALIESIN: Level two!

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.626
SAM: Do I have to go, too?

00:47:43.626 --> 00:47:45.178
MATT: Oh yeah.

00:47:45.178 --> 00:47:51.978
SAM: But I was just a bystander! I was walking
down here and I saw these two ruffians and

00:47:51.978 --> 00:47:53.929
I was going to go get help.

00:47:53.929 --> 00:47:55.081
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:47:55.081 --> 00:47:57.683
LAURA: It's actually true, she wasn't with us.

00:47:57.683 --> 00:47:58.955
SAM: Zero.

00:47:58.955 --> 00:48:05.283
(laughter)

00:48:05.283 --> 00:48:07.481
TRAVIS: You rolled a zero?

00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:08.907
LIAM: Look at him!

00:48:08.907 --> 00:48:10.968
TRAVIS: What's your modifier, negative two?

00:48:10.968 --> 00:48:13.245
SAM: Three minus three is zero.

00:48:13.245 --> 00:48:15.849
MATT: That went into my nose.

00:48:15.849 --> 00:48:20.820
TRAVIS: Brave new world.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:30.093
MATT: As you're telling him this, your mask goes
(creak). He goes, "Arrest that creature!"

00:48:30.093 --> 00:48:34.430
TALIESIN: We're going to die from bad paperwork.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:36.477
MARISHA: Yeah, we really are.

00:48:36.477 --> 00:48:38.509
TALIESIN: Literally, we're going to die from bad
paperwork.

00:48:38.509 --> 00:48:41.971
MATT: You both are put in chains. You're put in
chains both arms and legs.

00:48:41.971 --> 00:48:43.656
LAURA: Oh, that's just mean.

00:48:43.656 --> 00:48:45.226
SAM: Racism!

00:48:45.226 --> 00:48:52.866
MATT: They bring you over to the stockade.
Mollymauk. I need you to make a stealth check with

00:48:52.866 --> 00:48:57.437
advantage.

00:48:57.437 --> 00:48:59.371
TALIESIN: 13.

00:48:59.371 --> 00:49:08.489
MATT: You guys slowly make your way through the
low grass over towards where the outside of the

00:49:08.489 --> 00:49:16.252
carnival is. As you approach, you can see there's
about five crownsguard that are making rounds

00:49:16.252 --> 00:49:20.459
around the outside. It looks like where previously
they had been keeping watch over the people that

00:49:20.459 --> 00:49:27.442
were there, since the murder of two of their own,
it has heightened the intensity of the watch. It

00:49:27.442 --> 00:49:32.505
looks like it's fairly well watched. You get the
sense, at a distance, that you would have a hard

00:49:32.505 --> 00:49:36.878
time getting in there. You can try and sneak her
in and sneak out, but it seems dangerous.

00:49:36.878 --> 00:49:44.573
TALIESIN: Oh, shite. Not even a good push to get
her underneath, just back into one of the tents,

00:49:44.573 --> 00:49:45.984
or no?

00:49:45.984 --> 00:49:47.669
MATT: You can try.

00:49:47.669 --> 00:49:54.215
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know they're caught, do
I?

00:49:54.215 --> 00:49:56.498
MATT: No, you have no idea.

00:49:56.498 --> 00:49:57.964
MARISHA: Let's all get caught.

00:49:57.964 --> 00:50:00.504
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and wait for an
advantageous moment.

00:50:00.504 --> 00:50:08.019
MATT: Which I'm going to allow you to do. You stay
outside of the outskirts of the torchlight at the

00:50:08.019 --> 00:50:13.508
very front of the tent and the back of the tent.
The fire of the actual encampment has gone out

00:50:13.508 --> 00:50:21.078
because you don't see any other carnival members.
The sisters ran. They fled. You don't see any sign

00:50:21.078 --> 00:50:28.824
of Desmond or Ornna. Make one more stealth check,
for the two of you, with advantage because you still

00:50:28.824 --> 00:50:32.341
have the ability. You're at the cusp end of it
though.

00:50:32.341 --> 00:50:34.669
TALIESIN: Ooh. 22.

00:50:34.669 --> 00:50:41.728
MATT: You manage to pace yourself, just carefully
wait for the right moment, dart out of the grass

00:50:41.728 --> 00:50:46.100
having her under your arm and she's like, "What?
Why? What is going on?"

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:53.939
TALIESIN: You remember. Nothing happened. Find
Ornna. You didn't see me. You just hid and waited

00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:59.706
and you didn't know that anything was wrong. If
people ask, unless you hear from me, you don't

00:50:59.706 --> 00:51:01.399
know anything.

00:51:01.399 --> 00:51:07.400
MATT: "Okay." You slip her into the tent and back
out, none the wiser.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.950
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading back to the
inn.

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:14.537
MATT: Okay. You go back to the inn. You two.
You're just waiting?

00:51:14.537 --> 00:51:21.342
LIAM: No, I'm not waiting. I'm going to see Norda,
so I'll see you shortly. Be ready.

00:51:21.342 --> 00:51:22.741
TRAVIS: You will.

00:51:22.741 --> 00:51:29.394
MATT: Okay. You make your way to the stockade. As
you approach and make your way into the interior,

00:51:29.394 --> 00:51:33.960
the two crownsguard at the front say, "Hold. What's
your business?"

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:40.658
LIAM: Excuse me, and I lurch and prop myself up
against a wall and push back. Excuse me. I just

00:51:40.658 --> 00:51:43.355
had a very harrowing night.

00:51:43.355 --> 00:51:45.213
MATT: "Have you been drinking?"

00:51:45.213 --> 00:51:52.207
LIAM: You get me Norda this very minute and I will
tell you what has happened with this circus and in

00:51:52.207 --> 00:51:58.457
this town and don't keep me waiting another
minute. I'm bleeding out here. Arschloch.

00:51:58.457 --> 00:52:00.751
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:02.626
TALIESIN: Nice.

00:52:02.626 --> 00:52:05.969
LIAM: Oh, come on.

00:52:05.969 --> 00:52:07.343
MATT: Just keep it in the--

00:52:07.343 --> 00:52:17.107
LIAM: I wish I had gone with that because it was
great there but it's not great here. That is a nine!

00:52:17.107 --> 00:52:25.282
MATT: It is indeed. He sits there and glares down
at you for a second, your posturing, this

00:52:25.282 --> 00:52:33.419
filthy, scruffy man in a coat that wandered up out
of nowhere covered in a little bit of his own

00:52:33.419 --> 00:52:41.407
blood. He just looks down at you for a second,
"Sorry. She's done for the night."

00:52:41.407 --> 00:52:46.974
SAM: They keep regular hours here.

00:52:46.974 --> 00:52:53.376
LIAM: Excuse me. There are very good people being
held under house arrest in a tavern right now.

00:52:53.376 --> 00:52:59.144
They are innocent. I have evidence that I can show
her. This whole thing can be solved now.

00:52:59.144 --> 00:53:06.703
MATT: "This whole thing can be solved first thing
in the morning. I'll let you sleep it off. Have

00:53:06.703 --> 00:53:12.046
"some water. Come back when you're feeling a little
more yourself."

00:53:12.046 --> 00:53:17.791
SAM: Kill them all.

00:53:17.791 --> 00:53:20.774
TRAVIS: I draw back, and flames burst forth!

00:53:20.774 --> 00:53:30.907
LIAM: Okay. I look him in the eye. I will go away.
Get the message to her that the head of the circus

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:34.334
frog is at the docks, waiting for her inspection.

00:53:34.334 --> 00:53:39.703
MATT: At this point, you hear a voice on the
inside, just like, "Good night, good night" and a

00:53:39.703 --> 00:53:50.827
cloaked figure exits the front doorway, roughly
about four and a half foot tall.

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:52.452
LIAM: I remember the height.

00:53:52.452 --> 00:53:58.324
MATT: Norda is off the clock and is currently
leaving for the evening to return to her home.

00:53:58.324 --> 00:54:07.557
LIAM: (shouting) There is a circus toad's remains
at the docks! I would like to put this town's

00:54:07.557 --> 00:54:14.417
fears to rest. I am looking for-- What's her name?
Yorda.

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:15.872
ALL: Norda.

00:54:15.872 --> 00:54:18.573
LIAM: Norda. Yorda's at the inn. Right?

00:54:18.573 --> 00:54:23.648
MATT: There's Norda and then Yorda because I like
to make it as confusing as possible.

00:54:23.648 --> 00:54:27.357
LIAM: Liam's memory is really spotty, but Caleb's
is rock-solid.

00:54:27.357 --> 00:54:30.702
MATT: It's funny. When you spell things on paper,
they seem so much different and when you say them

00:54:30.702 --> 00:54:39.786
out loud they're like, "Ah, they're very similar."
The figure stops and turns and you hear this

00:54:39.786 --> 00:54:48.314
audible (heavy sigh). The figure waddles over
towards you and pulls the hood back and it's

00:54:48.314 --> 00:54:53.218
Norda. "All right, what's this about a frog
head?"

00:54:53.218 --> 00:54:59.523
LIAM: Thank goodness. Thank you, gentlemen.
Forgive me, I can see that you're trying to get

00:54:59.523 --> 00:55:01.397
yourself home to bed.

00:55:01.397 --> 00:55:07.857
MATT: "That would be preferable, aye." You see
bags under her eyes. She's had a long day, her

00:55:07.857 --> 00:55:11.627
hair's a bit frazzled, and she looks like she's
waiting for you to finish.

00:55:11.627 --> 00:55:17.372
LIAM: You are very aware that there are people at the
Nestled Nook under house arrest by your order?

00:55:17.372 --> 00:55:24.081
They are innocent and I can prove it, and I would
like to end things as quickly as possible. I have

00:55:24.081 --> 00:55:29.621
killed one of the circus folk this evening.

00:55:29.621 --> 00:55:37.150
MATT: "Now this'll be real interesting." She looks
past you, and you follow her eyeline, and there

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:45.494
you hear the sound of chains as a handful of
crownsguard with Jester, Beau, and Nott, in

00:55:45.494 --> 00:55:48.852
manacles, approach from behind. "These ones,
you're talking about, right?"

00:55:48.852 --> 00:55:52.212
MARISHA: Help. Help. Help.

00:55:52.212 --> 00:55:56.618
(laughter)

00:55:56.618 --> 00:56:02.025
LIAM: Funny story. Yes, these are the people I was
talking about. Nothing has changed, however, and I

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:07.276
am only asking to take another ten minutes of your
time to walk to the dock. One of the performers

00:56:07.276 --> 00:56:16.163
has been killed this evening, and I have done it.
I staked out the circus because my friends were in

00:56:16.163 --> 00:56:20.853
trouble, and wrongly accused, and I knew this. So
I staked out the circus this evening, and watched

00:56:20.853 --> 00:56:30.092
as this toad thing left the grounds there. It did
this to me, and I, in a rage, followed it and

00:56:30.092 --> 00:56:35.456
destroyed it, and I will show you the remains of
my work. We'll put it to bed. I'm either a clown

00:56:35.456 --> 00:56:38.650
or I'm a toad-killer. Let's see what it is.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:41.438
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:56:41.438 --> 00:56:44.375
LIAM: Come on, you fucker.

00:56:44.375 --> 00:56:46.542
LAURA: Oh, goddamn.

00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:49.071
LIAM: 11.

00:56:49.071 --> 00:57:03.612
MATT: She goes, (sighs) "Hold onto them for just a
moment." She walks back inside. A moment passes,

00:57:03.612 --> 00:57:07.352
and she returns with four other guards.

00:57:07.352 --> 00:57:11.601
LAURA: I keep doing this so I can make a jingling
sound with my chains.

00:57:11.601 --> 00:57:18.385
LIAM: You know, that's probably agitating the
issue. Let's go to the docks.

00:57:18.385 --> 00:57:29.806
MATT: She comes up. "All right. Drag them along
with us. Show us what this thing is, and if what

00:57:29.806 --> 00:57:33.834
"you say is not true, you'll join them. How's that
sound?"

00:57:33.834 --> 00:57:36.850
LIAM: I'm good with these terms. Follow me
please.

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:38.499
MATT: "All right."

00:57:38.499 --> 00:57:44.075
LAURA: You know, the only reason we were out of
the inn is because we were looking for you, Caleb.

00:57:44.075 --> 00:57:46.158
We didn't know where you went.

00:57:46.158 --> 00:57:52.135
LIAM: I am not going to answer her. I'm just
walking very firmly, with purpose, to the docks.

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:56.799
MATT: It has been close to an hour at this point.

00:57:56.799 --> 00:58:04.513
TRAVIS: If I can clock that, I would like to leave
the head, move off into the shadows, and assume my

00:58:04.513 --> 00:58:07.362
older man form.

00:58:07.362 --> 00:58:10.654
MATT: Using your second slot.

00:58:10.654 --> 00:58:12.929
TRAVIS: No, I can just drop--

00:58:12.929 --> 00:58:15.654
MATT: Oh no, you can do this whenever, that's
right.

00:58:15.654 --> 00:58:20.865
TRAVIS: I'll drop the crownsguard, and make the
old man and sit so I can keep an eye on it, but

00:58:20.865 --> 00:58:21.952
away from it.

00:58:21.952 --> 00:58:26.492
MATT: Eventually, you guys are led up to the
docks, where you guide them.

00:58:26.492 --> 00:58:31.828
LIAM: Moment of confusion-- here it is, right
here, where I left it. Nobody has tampered with

00:58:31.828 --> 00:58:38.191
it. I turn around and I pull back my clothing and
show a huge slash across my body, and say: You see

00:58:38.191 --> 00:58:41.728
this? It was done by this thing. (whoosh)

00:58:41.728 --> 00:58:47.789
MATT: As soon as you pull back and reveal the
face, its jaw is relaxed now, its muscles have sat

00:58:47.789 --> 00:58:55.437
now that it's been left in the dock, and it's
pooled at its base. This old pumpkin look. Its

00:58:55.437 --> 00:59:00.418
tongue's lolling out and unraveled on the ground,
what remained within its salivary glands has

00:59:00.418 --> 00:59:05.544
soaked the remaining wood around its base. One of
the eyes has rolled back, but it's a horrible

00:59:05.544 --> 00:59:10.558
display. The guards take a step back immediately
at the reveal, and Norda immediately gets

00:59:10.558 --> 00:59:16.100
interested, gets close, takes a look at it, and
begins prodding a bit with her finger.

00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:20.113
LIAM: It is as bad as it looks, and if you have
any holy people in this city, they will confirm

00:59:20.113 --> 00:59:25.895
that this thing is fiendish.

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:33.525
MATT: (sighs) "You say it's a fiend? Because what
this looks like is you just murdered one of our

00:59:33.525 --> 00:59:45.037
"possible witnesses and/or other members of this
investigation, so I'm hoping this is a fiend. I

00:59:45.037 --> 00:59:46.438
"don't know fiends."

00:59:46.438 --> 00:59:51.948
LIAM: I hope you don't believe that I slashed open
my own body and then went to the police.

00:59:51.948 --> 00:59:59.232
MATT: "Honey, I've been doing this for a long
time. I've seen stranger. Hold on just a second."

00:59:59.232 --> 01:00:07.363
She calls one of the guards over, whispers to him
for a second. He rushes off. "Just so happens we have

01:00:07.363 --> 01:00:12.319
"someone in town who might be able to confirm this
for us, might help your case."

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:13.778
LAURA: Who is it?

01:00:13.778 --> 01:00:16.237
MATT: "Oh, they will be here shortly."

01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:18.223
LIAM: I sit down on a crate and I stop talking.

01:00:18.223 --> 01:00:23.007
MATT: Okay, and this awkward period of time with
the guards all just standing there, holding you

01:00:23.007 --> 01:00:27.761
as you wait patiently. Some of them are tapping
their fingers. You start rattling your chains and

01:00:27.761 --> 01:00:34.853
two guards pull the chains taut so you can't do it
anymore. Mollymauk, as you begin to make your way

01:00:34.853 --> 01:00:40.622
back into town, because you're making your way
through the dock district along the lakeside and

01:00:40.622 --> 01:00:44.280
you look up ahead, and you can see there's a
couple of torches being held by crownsguard right

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.509
where the head was left, and you can see Caleb,
and then three of your allies in chains.

01:00:49.509 --> 01:01:00.687
TALIESIN: Hmm. (sighs)

01:01:00.687 --> 01:01:02.656
LAURA: Oh no! What are you going to do?

01:01:02.656 --> 01:01:04.388
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a little closer.

01:01:04.388 --> 01:01:07.519
MATT: All right, make a stealth check, please. You
do not have advantage anymore, that has passed.

01:01:07.519 --> 01:01:09.107
It's been more than a hour.

01:01:09.107 --> 01:01:12.625
TALIESIN: Just to take a look at what is actually
going on.

01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:14.053
LAURA: Not to get too close.

01:01:14.053 --> 01:01:15.612
TALIESIN: Not too close.

01:01:15.612 --> 01:01:18.045
MATT: Yeah, it's not a high DC.

01:01:18.045 --> 01:01:19.601
TALIESIN: 19!

01:01:19.601 --> 01:01:24.931
MATT: You get a little closer, you are still maybe
a good 100 feet or so away from them, keeping to

01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:31.685
the shadows along a building, keeping low.
Thankfully it's nighttime, it's pushing midnight

01:01:31.685 --> 01:01:35.637
at this point. Because you're ostentatiously
dressed, but there isn't a lot of light in your

01:01:35.637 --> 01:01:42.816
colors. As far as you know right now, no one can
see you, you're too far away to hear much, but you

01:01:42.816 --> 01:01:43.936
can keep an eye on them.

01:01:50.976 --> 01:01:54.471
TALIESIN: Oh, what's the play? What's the play?

01:01:57.653 --> 01:02:05.302
Ah! I'm going to--
Yeah, fuck it. I'm going to walk up.

01:02:05.302 --> 01:02:07.647
MATT: All right.

01:02:07.647 --> 01:02:15.137
TALIESIN: With briskly. There I find you!
I've been looking everywhere.

01:02:15.137 --> 01:02:18.137
You're not supposed to leave 
the bloody inn you-- oh.

01:02:18.137 --> 01:02:21.956
(sighs) They're already in trouble, apparently.

01:02:25.273 --> 01:02:33.416
MATT: "I love when they do this! Chain him up."
You are shackled as well.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:37.644
TALIESIN: All right. Less questions to answer.

01:02:37.644 --> 01:02:44.061
MATT: At this point, Norda is starting to smile a
bit. She's like "Man, if we could have more

01:02:44.061 --> 01:02:49.353
criminals like you lot, my job would be far
easier. I would get home a lot earlier."

01:02:49.353 --> 01:02:55.358
SAM: We're not criminals! We're not! Me and Caleb
were just travelling ever since we broke out of that--

01:02:59.874 --> 01:03:01.212
Nothing!

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.117
TALIESIN: Dance number.

01:03:03.117 --> 01:03:07.880
LIAM: No, it's good that you try so hard to
protect the rights of giant frog creatures. I'm

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.330
very impressed.

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:12.303
LAURA: Fiend creatures specifically.

01:03:12.303 --> 01:03:15.959
MATT: At this point the guard that had left
earlier, who has been gone for about 15 to 20

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:20.063
minutes or so, comes back with a brisk jog.
There's another figure walking up behind him, also

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:29.294
jogging. You can see light gray hood and cloak
around and as the figure approaches into the torch

01:03:29.294 --> 01:03:36.781
light, pulls back the hood, and you see this long
shoulder length curled blond hair. A very very

01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:48.459
delicate looking elven male, who approaches. "I
believe I've been summoned, Norda?" "Yes sorry,

01:03:48.459 --> 01:03:58.037
this is Archivist Zeenoth. He's been in town for a
few days and he comes from the library that knows

01:03:58.037 --> 01:04:06.321
a lot about a lot of things. I hope that he can
help us in this. Zeenoth, they're calling this

01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:15.042
thing a fiend. What do you know about this?" He
steps closer, kneels down next to the head.

01:04:15.042 --> 01:04:16.982
TALIESIN: Xhorhas.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:17.868
MATT: Hmm?

01:04:17.868 --> 01:04:20.885
TALIESIN: I just whisper Xhorhas.

01:04:20.885 --> 01:04:28.698
MATT: "Yes, these creatures do frequent Xhorhas."
He gives some look over, pulls a small book out of

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:36.291
his side pouch. Begins to thumb through it,
compares a few things. "I'm not a specialist,

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:48.608
unfortunately. This creature is very much a very
dangerous entity from the far east. I'm surprised

01:04:48.608 --> 01:04:57.278
it made it this far into civilization before being
destroyed. It's a good thing it has been." He now

01:04:57.278 --> 01:05:02.537
gets to look at everyone, over the crew and goes,
"Are you the ones who slew it?"

01:05:02.813 --> 01:05:06.465
LAURA: Oh well technically it was Caleb,
technically.

01:05:06.465 --> 01:05:08.740
LIAM: Just me.

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:13.033
MATT: As the figure looks over and stops on Beau
and kind of smiles.

01:05:13.033 --> 01:05:16.716
SAM: What's going on over there?

01:05:16.716 --> 01:05:20.786
MARISHA: Oh sorry, I just have back issues. I'm
just stretching.

01:05:20.786 --> 01:05:30.562
LIAM: Yes it was difficult, but I prevailed in the
end. The city is safe. What library was that that

01:05:30.562 --> 01:05:32.570
you mentioned?

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:36.160
MATT: "Oh I'm an archivist. I'm the archivist of
the Cobalt Soul."

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.832
LIAM: Here in town?

01:05:38.832 --> 01:05:43.623
MATT: "No, I'm from Zadash. I'm a bit out of my
depth at the moment."

01:05:43.645 --> 01:05:46.597
LAURA: What brings you this far?

01:05:46.597 --> 01:05:55.472
MATT: "Well, I have business." At this point Norda
goes, "All right you know what? This is some

01:05:55.472 --> 01:06:00.589
serious bullshite. We're all just chilling here at
the docks, we have confirmed that's a fiend."

01:06:00.741 --> 01:06:02.770
LAURA: The nergaliid!

01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:12.484
MATT: "A nergaliid! Bring them back to the
stockade. Let's have a trial." They begin to pull

01:06:12.599 --> 01:06:17.178
you guys back to the stockade. Two of the guards
grab the nergaliid head and they begin dragging it

01:06:17.178 --> 01:06:19.517
along, and you guys are all being pulled.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:25.106
LIAM: Oh sorry, one last thing, Watchmaster. I
pull out the book that I read about the nergaliid.

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:31.880
Here this is a gift, for you. This is folklore.
You will find I have marked a page in there. It

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.210
will describe this thing.

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:37.173
MATT: As you guys are walking, she thumbs through
and finds the page, begins to read, passes it to

01:06:37.173 --> 01:06:43.181
the archivist. He begins to read it. He passes it
back. You guys all make your way into the

01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:48.058
stockade. You're not brought to her chambers,
you're brought to a much larger room. This room

01:06:48.058 --> 01:06:56.809
has much more of a stark, barren, stone interior.
There are benches built. There is a central kind

01:06:56.809 --> 01:07:02.700
of a pit. There's about four or five steps down
into this pit. Then above that is a desk where

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:09.755
Norda takes as the law master. As you step in you
realize, oh this is a room of judgement. What are

01:07:09.755 --> 01:07:11.136
you doing?

01:07:11.136 --> 01:07:15.820
TRAVIS: I would like to try, once they start
making their way back to that facility, to quickly

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:23.453
make my way to the inn, if I can as the old man,
enter, make my way into the restroom, drop my

01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:29.918
disguise, come back out as Fjord. Oh the water
closet, what have you.

01:07:29.918 --> 01:07:31.953
MATT: There is a shared water closet.

01:07:31.953 --> 01:07:33.281
LIAM: It's just a pot.

01:07:33.281 --> 01:07:37.859
TRAVIS: Yeah, the room with the pot in it. Then
make my way back to the front door, stick my head

01:07:37.859 --> 01:07:39.684
out where the guards are.

01:07:39.684 --> 01:07:42.937
MATT: Yeah, there's two guards still posted there.
Most of them have already left because they're

01:07:42.937 --> 01:07:44.572
carting off the rest of your friends.

01:07:44.572 --> 01:07:49.185
TRAVIS: Please, I can't seem to find any of my
comrades. Have you seen where they have gone?

01:07:49.185 --> 01:07:53.075
MATT: They look at each other. "Yeah, they've been
arrested."

01:07:53.075 --> 01:08:01.513
TRAVIS: I was afraid as much. Could I make my way
down to where they are being held? I would like to

01:08:01.513 --> 01:08:04.390
be present, if it would be prudent.

01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:17.270
MATT: "You leave our watch, we cut you." They both
flank you side to side and push you ahead a little

01:08:17.416 --> 01:08:21.086
bit. They are glued to your right and left.

01:08:21.086 --> 01:08:22.631
TRAVIS: Very kind of you.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:27.984
MATT: They lead you to the stockade. As you guys
are brought into this chamber, Norda sets up.

01:08:27.984 --> 01:08:31.167
SAM: Who is going to go get the little girl?

01:08:33.917 --> 01:08:39.930
LIAM: You're the little girl here. You're
confused. It's been a night.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:50.929
MATT: Norda, up there at the top, takes her cloak
off, puts on her ceremonial armor bits. There's a

01:08:50.929 --> 01:08:56.759
whole element to the presentation of this. You can
see her tiredly putting them on. Sets her hands on

01:08:56.759 --> 01:09:05.210
the top, "I would like you to present what
evidence you have to absolve you of these charges

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:10.387
against you and then based on what you present,
I'll decide whether or not you're innocent or

01:09:10.387 --> 01:09:20.125
guilty or require further investigation. Who would
like to present evidence first? You! You brought

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:26.625
the head of a creature! You're not in chains.
We'll start with you." They drag the creature's

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:33.314
head forward. She takes the book from the
archivist. "And speaking with Zeenoth here, it

01:09:33.314 --> 01:09:39.847
appears what you said is true. This creature is a
dangerous, terrible fiend. And looking at it's

01:09:39.847 --> 01:09:49.318
apparent ability to feast on the essence of
creatures, this explains both the transformation

01:09:49.318 --> 01:10:01.974
of the old man. This also explains destruction of
our two guards, who were recently discovered. Rest

01:10:01.974 --> 01:10:10.526
their soul. So, that explains that. Convince me as
to why you were not working with this entity,

01:10:10.687 --> 01:10:18.228
especially those of the carnival." She snaps her
finger again and you watch as Gustav and Bosun are

01:10:18.228 --> 01:10:26.686
brought into the chamber, as well as a third
figure who you see step out of the shadows. Her

01:10:26.686 --> 01:10:35.823
hair dark and fading to white, last seen fleeing
into the distant fields, you see, in chains as

01:10:35.823 --> 01:10:39.943
well, Yasha being pulled into the courtroom.

01:10:39.943 --> 01:10:43.400
(cheering)

01:10:44.444 --> 01:10:47.045
TRAVIS: Showing up just to get arrested!

01:10:47.045 --> 01:10:50.240
MARISHA: Welcome to the club!

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.017
LIAM: (singing) Breaking the law, breaking the
law!

01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:56.674
TALIESIN: Lot of help you were!

01:10:56.674 --> 01:10:58.342
MARISHA: Welcome to the chain gang.

01:10:58.342 --> 01:11:00.119
ASHLEY: Hey. Yeah.

01:11:00.119 --> 01:11:02.142
MATT: "That one was caught fleeing from the
scene."

01:11:02.142 --> 01:11:08.503
ASHLEY: No, that's completely a misunderstanding
of things. That's not what happened.

01:11:08.503 --> 01:11:14.771
MATT: "I'm certain. You have a trustworthy face.
What's the next bit of evidence you want to

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.947
present, please? Anyone?"

01:11:16.947 --> 01:11:20.135
LIAM: Well, first a question. Are you familiar
with Occam's Razor?

01:11:20.135 --> 01:11:21.974
MATT: "What?"

01:11:21.974 --> 01:11:28.869
LIAM: I figured. Okay. That one works for the
circus. Do I look like I work for the circus?

01:11:28.869 --> 01:11:33.734
MATT: "Strangely, not well dressed enough."

01:11:33.734 --> 01:11:38.627
LIAM: No. I'm a dirty hobo and I reek like
yesterday's garbage.

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:42.878
MATT: "I wasn't going to go that far, but I'll
admiss it."

01:11:42.878 --> 01:11:52.319
LIAM: Yeah. This one, does he look like a circus
performer? Is he filthy like me?

01:11:52.319 --> 01:11:54.927
LAURA: He's not here.

01:11:54.927 --> 01:11:58.161
MATT: "Which one?" Fjord has not arrived yet.

01:11:58.161 --> 01:12:00.938
LIAM: But he's right here! Look, I can touch him.

01:12:00.938 --> 01:12:06.166
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of that, as you
say that and reveal your hand, Fjord enters

01:12:06.166 --> 01:12:09.701
through the door like it was a planned arrival.

01:12:09.878 --> 01:12:12.673
SAM: Weirdly, he's dripping wet.

01:12:12.673 --> 01:12:14.641
TRAVIS: Baby oil.

01:12:14.641 --> 01:12:20.828
LIAM: The sardonic one, right? With the
shit-eating grin. Does she look like she works for

01:12:20.828 --> 01:12:22.711
the circus?

01:12:22.711 --> 01:12:27.104
MATT: "I don't know what she works for, but I
don't trust her."

01:12:27.104 --> 01:12:29.880
MARISHA: That's smart.

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:40.345
LIAM: I am injured within a centimeter of my life.
This one is a nincompoop.

01:12:40.821 --> 01:12:43.927
LAURA: Wait, which one were you pointing at?

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:47.795
LIAM: That's you. I pull the mask away. This is my
good friend. She's a goblin.

01:12:47.795 --> 01:12:50.144
SAM: A little halfling girl!

01:12:50.144 --> 01:12:53.845
MATT: At this point, you watch her pull back.

01:12:53.845 --> 01:12:59.762
LIAM: I step in front of her. She is my friend and
colleague and you will not lay a hand on her while

01:12:59.762 --> 01:13:01.753
I am standing here.

01:13:01.753 --> 01:13:03.441
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:13:03.441 --> 01:13:05.520
LIAM: Fucking right I will.

01:13:07.444 --> 01:13:13.317
That is an 11.
(chanting) Level two!

01:13:13.317 --> 01:13:17.074
MARISHA: (chanting) Shitty dice!

01:13:17.074 --> 01:13:22.492
MATT: Her eyes are chained onto this goblin.

01:13:22.492 --> 01:13:30.174
LIAM: She's looking into my chest because Nott is
behind me. I'm sorry, I'm confused why you're

01:13:30.174 --> 01:13:37.061
going to such lengths to defend the rights of this
large, oversized frog skull.

01:13:37.061 --> 01:13:43.372
MATT: "I defend no rights of this creature! I've
been in this office long enough to know that there

01:13:43.372 --> 01:13:49.066
aren't usually solo workers on something like
this. I know these folk. They all protect each

01:13:49.066 --> 01:13:54.222
other. Who's to say this wasn't their whole
reasoning for coming anyway, and something went

01:13:54.222 --> 01:13:56.780
wrong, and they're letting him take the fall?"

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.988
LIAM: There's a big conspiracy to make undead
crownsguard here in the city?

01:13:59.988 --> 01:14:04.884
MATT: "I don't fucking know! Don't tell me how I
do my business! Sit the fuck down! Who's next?"

01:14:04.884 --> 01:14:11.380
TALIESIN: You're right. We do protect our own.
That's absolutely true.

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:16.874
MATT: "Let him up." They loosen the chains and you
get to stand and approach a bit.

01:14:16.874 --> 01:14:23.552
TALIESIN: It's a common tactic. It's a good way to
make your way through this world. Normally it

01:14:23.552 --> 01:14:34.859
works. We assumed, the circus, anyway, that we
were being framed. We were protecting our own. Is

01:14:34.859 --> 01:14:37.957
the head in here?

01:14:37.957 --> 01:14:39.607
LAURA: Yes.

01:14:39.607 --> 01:14:46.014
TALIESIN: This one showed his true colors, and
then we took care of it. I'm going to throw one of

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:50.057
my swords down on the ground that is filthy with
its blood.

01:14:50.057 --> 01:14:55.816
MATT: "All right. Why did this one run?"

01:14:59.816 --> 01:15:00.948
ASHLEY: Well--

01:15:02.388 --> 01:15:04.090
SAM: (high-pitched) I mean--

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:19.439
ASHLEY: I feel like I didn't need to be in there
anymore. You know. I don't-- ugh.

01:15:19.439 --> 01:15:22.119
MATT: I would like you both to make persuasion
checks.

01:15:22.119 --> 01:15:24.533
ASHLEY: I feel like--

01:15:28.543 --> 01:15:30.399
TALIESIN: Oh, shit. 12.

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:34.787
ASHLEY: 11.

01:15:34.787 --> 01:15:40.185
TALIESIN: We needed someone on the outside. We
knew we were innocent. We knew you didn't think

01:15:40.185 --> 01:15:46.618
so. We just assumed you were going to have us all
executed and we didn't do anything. What would you

01:15:46.618 --> 01:15:48.276
have done?

01:15:48.276 --> 01:15:51.076
MATT: "Is that goblin pissing in my court?"

01:15:51.076 --> 01:15:53.294
(laughter)

01:15:53.294 --> 01:15:56.967
SAM: I'm sorry! I'm really nervous!

01:15:56.967 --> 01:16:00.789
TALIESIN: In his defense, it's a wonderful
vintage. Her defense.

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:07.878
SAM: I'm very nervous. I'm sorry, it's just your
guards shackled both my wrists and my ankles and I

01:16:07.878 --> 01:16:12.082
can't move to get into a good position.

01:16:12.082 --> 01:16:16.180
LIAM: You know, when she's nervous she aerates her
bladder, all right?

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:23.612
SAM: Look, I have some evidence to submit. Look at
my hands and also the hands of Jester. We're

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:30.225
covered in the thing's blood. We were there too.
We helped the killing of the creature.

01:16:30.225 --> 01:16:38.943
MATT: The dwarf woman, Norda, leans forward and
looks you dead in the eyes. "I've known friends I

01:16:38.943 --> 01:16:51.488
grew up with who were carved down by your kin.
Convince me why I shouldn't hang you tomorrow."

01:16:51.488 --> 01:17:01.475
SAM: I'm sorry for your loss. Where are your
people from?

01:17:01.475 --> 01:17:03.109
MATT: "Grimgolir."

01:17:03.109 --> 01:17:11.214
SAM: That's not where my clan's from. I had
nothing to do with it. My clan operates far, far

01:17:11.214 --> 01:17:12.490
away and--

01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:15.614
MATT: "Where does your clan operate from?"

01:17:18.624 --> 01:17:24.455
SAM: I'm looking on the map. Near the Felderwin
Tillage.

01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:30.970
MATT: "That's not too far. Maybe we'll send some
folks to pay a visit to your clan."

01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:38.799
SAM: You can. Feel free. I'll even tell you where
they are. I'm no longer associated with them and I

01:17:38.799 --> 01:17:42.479
can help you hunt them down if you'd like.

01:17:42.479 --> 01:17:43.974
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:17:43.974 --> 01:17:45.915
MARISHA: Wow.

01:17:46.406 --> 01:17:48.128
LAURA: What is it?

01:17:48.128 --> 01:17:50.488
SAM: One.

01:17:51.804 --> 01:17:56.414
LAURA: No, but you didn't roll a one. He rolled a
four.

01:17:56.414 --> 01:18:00.121
SAM: It's not a natural one.

01:18:00.121 --> 01:18:02.090
LAURA and TALIESIN: Not a natural one.

01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:03.422
LIAM: Still sucks.

01:18:03.422 --> 01:18:07.192
MATT: (sigh)

01:18:07.192 --> 01:18:09.587
LAURA: God, why are we rolling so bad?

01:18:09.587 --> 01:18:28.585
MATT: She leans back. "I want to sleep. I think
you're telling the truth. Most of you. Archivist,

01:18:28.585 --> 01:18:33.158
does this resonate with you as well? Does this
check out, lore-wise? I don't know what the fuck

01:18:33.158 --> 01:18:41.087
you do." The Archivist is like, "I believe based
on what they've stated, at least it's consistent

01:18:41.087 --> 01:18:50.553
though I'm a bit confused as to the demeanor of
the goblin. It's not unheard of to have goblin kin

01:18:50.553 --> 01:18:55.484
turn against their own. There have been a number
of historic individuals of various monstrous races

01:18:55.484 --> 01:18:58.886
who have been beneficial members of society."

01:18:58.886 --> 01:19:02.157
LIAM: I invite Nott up to my piggy-back position
on my shoulders.

01:19:02.157 --> 01:19:03.945
LAURA: You can't, she's chained up.

01:19:03.945 --> 01:19:06.624
LIAM: I scoop her up.

01:19:06.624 --> 01:19:10.420
SAM: This is even more awkward. Just put me back
down. Put me back down.

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:13.484
LIAM: Just let it happen.

01:19:13.484 --> 01:19:20.412
SAM: No! The chains are pulling me one way and
you're pulling me the other way. Just come down to

01:19:20.412 --> 01:19:23.292
my level! Come down here!

01:19:27.342 --> 01:19:34.447
MATT: "Bring the two others forward." They bring
forward Gustav and Bosun. "This is your circus,

01:19:34.497 --> 01:19:42.480
right?" He goes, "It is my circus and I take full
responsibility for what's happened. Sincerely.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:48.542
They have done nothing wrong. They are completely
innocent. I brought this creature into our fold

01:19:48.542 --> 01:19:56.062
and that is on me. Whatever judgement you have,
bring onto my head, not theirs. Please. I implore

01:19:56.062 --> 01:20:10.569
you." "Fine. I'll consider the investigation
closed. You're all freed of charges against you.

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:16.661
Including the goblin."

01:20:16.791 --> 01:20:20.739
SAM: Oh! Thank you! I would kiss you if I could.

01:20:20.739 --> 01:20:36.145
MATT: "I would not recommend trying. Okay. Gustav,
what's-- I can't read your last name. You've been

01:20:36.145 --> 01:20:42.104
given quite a debt for Trostenwald so you shall
remain here until you've worked off the debt to

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:56.895
the city. To the number of 2,645 gold pieces. To
make up for the deaths of our two crownsguard, of

01:20:56.895 --> 01:21:05.298
the two civilians who have died, and the general
cost of this entire investigation. We'll consider

01:21:05.489 --> 01:21:15.231
what your work is to the city tomorrow. However,
the rest of you: you're free to go. I'm going to

01:21:15.231 --> 01:21:17.839
go get myself some sleep."

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:20.925
LIAM: Can I have my book back, please?

01:21:20.925 --> 01:21:29.180
MATT: Takes her armor off. "(sigh) All right. I'm
going to get a drink." She puts her cloak on and

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:36.087
then hops off. With the imposing sight of her on
top of a large pedestal and desk, she hops down to

01:21:36.087 --> 01:21:39.585
her natural dwarven height and it's almost
adorable to watch her just skitter the hell out of

01:21:39.585 --> 01:21:41.966
there. She's done.

01:21:41.966 --> 01:21:44.065
LAURA: Where are you getting a drink at?

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:45.461
MATT: There's no response.

01:21:45.461 --> 01:21:47.859
LAURA: Do you want company?

01:21:47.859 --> 01:21:49.875
TRAVIS: I just turn to the nearest crownsguard
and--

01:21:49.875 --> 01:22:04.051
MATT: The chains are removed. They free everybody,
including Gustav, but two guards are assigned to

01:22:04.051 --> 01:22:07.334
him to keep an eye over him.

01:22:07.334 --> 01:22:12.309
MARISHA: As soon as Beau gets out of her chains, I
grab my stuff and I leave.

01:22:12.309 --> 01:22:23.071
MATT: Okay. As you are exiting the stockade, in
the archway of the doors right outside, you see

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:30.076
another figure standing hood up-- like a short
hood with a mantle that stops about midway. Bare

01:22:30.076 --> 01:22:36.948
arms and dark skin, baggy gray pants and is there,
waiting.

01:22:36.948 --> 01:22:39.011
MARISHA: What's the mantle?

01:22:39.011 --> 01:22:43.732
MATT: You don't recognize any details about it.
You see a cloaked figure there, waiting, looking

01:22:43.732 --> 01:22:45.364
right at you.

01:22:45.364 --> 01:22:47.331
MARISHA: Is he blocking the doorway?

01:22:47.331 --> 01:22:49.915
MATT: Is just beyond the doorway. It's not
blocked.

01:22:49.915 --> 01:22:52.410
MARISHA: Is there another way out?

01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:57.925
MATT: I mean, you can exit. They're just on the
other side of the door. Every other way in, you

01:22:57.925 --> 01:23:01.290
don't know the stockade well and all of it just
leads further into the stockade. There are other

01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:03.293
crownsguard inside.

01:23:03.293 --> 01:23:08.520
MARISHA: Okay, I'm just going to try and just bolt
through.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.345
MATT: You're just going to bolt? Full run?

01:23:11.345 --> 01:23:14.573
MARISHA: Not run, just you know, Irish goodbye.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:21.159
MATT: Okay. All right. As you briskly exit and
turn to the left, the figure intervenes and side

01:23:21.159 --> 01:23:24.160
steps right in front of you.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.840
MARISHA: Do I recognize him?

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:36.366
MATT: No. You don't see much of the face. The hood
is up and a little bit of the moonlight is coming,

01:23:36.366 --> 01:23:47.127
you can see the edge of features. The body is
muscular, but thin. Looks not terribly masculine

01:23:47.127 --> 01:23:54.150
or feminine, but it looks able and it moved at a
very quick speed to intercept your positioning.

01:23:57.350 --> 01:24:01.477
MARISHA: I just go: Oh, fuck! Turn around and walk
back in.

01:24:02.763 --> 01:24:04.783
MATT: Okay.

01:24:04.783 --> 01:24:08.167
MARISHA: I'll join everyone else. I flick off the
guy on my way back in.

01:24:08.167 --> 01:24:17.144
MATT: Okay. As you guys are being escorted out of the
stockade, Beau comes back in and joins you.

01:24:17.144 --> 01:24:18.705
LAURA: I thought you left.

01:24:18.705 --> 01:24:19.911
MARISHA: Just had to pee.

01:24:19.911 --> 01:24:20.900
LAURA: Oh.

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.037
TALIESIN: Shame.

01:24:22.037 --> 01:24:24.783
LAURA: Hey, you guys, we're town heroes! What's it
feel like?

01:24:24.783 --> 01:24:28.204
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah!

01:24:28.204 --> 01:24:30.358
LAURA: Yasha, it's very good to see you again.

01:24:30.358 --> 01:24:32.110
ASHLEY: It's good to see you guys, too.

01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:34.968
SAM: Where did you go? Were you on the lam for a
long time?

01:24:34.968 --> 01:24:49.137
ASHLEY: I have a little bit of a problem with
authority and I didn't want to be caught in a

01:24:49.137 --> 01:24:52.166
small and confined space and then that ended up
happening.

01:24:52.166 --> 01:24:54.303
LAURA: How long have you been in there?

01:24:54.303 --> 01:25:12.563
ASHLEY: Immediately after I ran away. They sent
out horses. I'm not that fast, but I did fuck up a

01:25:12.563 --> 01:25:15.511
few of the guards. "By accident. "

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:20.829
MATT: As you say that, you hear a couple (clears
throat) and two of the crownsguard visibly bruised

01:25:20.829 --> 01:25:27.321
that are escorting you guys out into the night air
before they eventually leave you to your own devices.

01:25:27.321 --> 01:25:32.741
TRAVIS: Molly, what do you think this means for
the carnival?

01:25:32.741 --> 01:25:36.059
TALIESIN: I don't know. That is a question.

01:25:36.059 --> 01:25:39.959
LAURA: I mean, if Gustav has to stay here then
who's going to run it?

01:25:39.959 --> 01:25:43.989
MARISHA: That's a lot of gold. That's like a life
sentence worth of gold.

01:25:43.989 --> 01:25:45.693
LAURA: Well, I mean--

01:25:45.693 --> 01:25:47.287
TALIESIN: Gold comes, gold goes.

01:25:47.287 --> 01:25:49.712
LIAM: How much do you think the circus has?

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:55.636
TALIESIN: I don't know how much the circus has and,
honestly, I think Ornna would lie about it if we asked.

01:25:55.636 --> 01:26:02.713
MATT: The crownsguard have pulled away and now
it's just you guys and Bosun and Gustav now, out

01:26:02.713 --> 01:26:16.716
in the air and Gustav is rubbing his wrists.
"Well, thank you everyone for helping. That could

01:26:16.716 --> 01:26:23.787
"have been a lot worse. And, you know, it's fine. I
know it's a lot of money, but shouldn't take me

01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:31.728
"more than a few years. It's a nice town!
Trostenwald is a nice town!"

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:33.722
TRAVIS: It's not that nice.

01:26:33.722 --> 01:26:36.129
MATT: "No, it's not, but you know, it's better than
prison."

01:26:36.129 --> 01:26:38.120
LAURA: There's a lot of beer here.

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:43.120
MATT: "That there is. I may have to start a small
fund for that on its own."

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:47.539
LIAM: What happens to the circus, because, you know,
you can't do the same show for the same people for

01:26:47.539 --> 01:26:48.706
a year?

01:26:48.706 --> 01:26:50.583
MATT: "Where's Ornna? Where's the twins?
Where's--"

01:26:50.583 --> 01:26:53.606
TALIESIN: Well, the twins buggered. Ornna? God
only knows.

01:26:53.606 --> 01:26:55.316
ASHLEY: Where's Toya?

01:26:55.316 --> 01:27:00.846
TALIESIN: Toya is back at the circus, but shaken.
Very shaken.

01:27:00.846 --> 01:27:07.388
MATT: At which point, Gustav just begins making a
beeline for the circus. Bosun goes, "Oh." (sighs)

01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:13.349
TALIESIN: How hard can it be to make 2,000 gold?

01:27:13.349 --> 01:27:18.530
MATT: "I don't know how much he saved. Nowhere
near that much, probably."

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:21.500
TALIESIN: How hard can it be to steal 2,000 gold?

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:27.639
LAURA: I don't know how many people around here
have that much. Although, the breweries might.

01:27:27.639 --> 01:27:33.462
TALIESIN: Maybe be best to find that gold
elsewhere.

01:27:33.462 --> 01:27:37.181
ASHLEY: Wait, so who killed him?

01:27:37.181 --> 01:27:46.037
MATT: Gustav has spun around and comes back and is
like, "Sincerely. I appreciate the aid, but don't.

01:27:46.037 --> 01:27:52.193
"This is on me. I'll take care of it. This is not
your responsibility. It's not your responsibility.

01:27:52.193 --> 01:27:57.716
"You guys have already done so much. It's fine.
I'll take care of it."

01:27:57.716 --> 01:28:06.225
TALIESIN: Suppose we should take a look at what's
left of the circus.

01:28:06.225 --> 01:28:11.614
MARISHA: Can I go take a look around? Do I see
Zeenoth anywhere?

01:28:11.614 --> 01:28:14.362
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:28:14.362 --> 01:28:19.862
MARISHA: Oh, god damn it, it was almost better. It
was almost good. Ten.

01:28:19.862 --> 01:28:22.563
MATT: Ten? You don't see anybody immediately
around.

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:28.188
LAURA: Was that Archivist Zeenoth that was outside?

01:28:28.188 --> 01:28:30.487
MARISHA: Archivist.

01:28:30.487 --> 01:28:32.767
LAURA: That's what I said. Was that who it was
that was like--

01:28:32.767 --> 01:28:35.855
MATT: No, Zeenoth was still inside the courtroom when
you were leaving.

01:28:35.855 --> 01:28:37.840
MARISHA: Yeah. Different guy.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.710
LAURA: Oh, who was it that was outside?

01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:41.077
LIAM: We don't know, we didn't see him.

01:28:41.077 --> 01:28:42.397
TRAVIS: It's very late, right?

01:28:42.397 --> 01:28:43.833
MATT: Yeah, it's post-midnight now.

01:28:43.833 --> 01:28:46.493
LAURA: I'm so tired.

01:28:46.493 --> 01:28:52.226
TRAVIS: Don't suppose you want to retire for the
evening? Share a drink together now that this is

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:53.939
somewhat behind us?

01:28:53.939 --> 01:28:58.243
TALIESIN: I will definitely drink. I think we
should probably drink at our camp then. I'm fine

01:28:58.243 --> 01:29:00.094
inviting them.

01:29:00.094 --> 01:29:07.283
MATT: "Tell you what. As a thanks, we'll grab
Toya. We'll meet you guys-- where are you all staying?"

01:29:07.283 --> 01:29:09.443
MARISHA and LIAM: The Nestled Nook.

01:29:09.443 --> 01:29:12.322
MATT: "We'll come meet you at the Nestled Nook and
I'll get a round for you all. As a thank you."

01:29:12.322 --> 01:29:15.518
TALIESIN: Is this a human thing to-- never mind

01:29:15.593 --> 01:29:18.058
LIAM: Yeah, we're just like tieflings, we're all
alike.

01:29:18.118 --> 01:29:20.526
TALIESIN: I know.

01:29:20.526 --> 01:29:29.706
MATT: "All right. Bosun, come on." They make their
way off to the carnival camp.

01:29:33.006 --> 01:29:35.295
ASHLEY: It was him?

01:29:35.295 --> 01:29:39.933
TALIESIN: Kylre went bad. Maybe he'd already
always been bad, I don't know.

01:29:39.933 --> 01:29:44.279
LAURA: I mean, he attacked us. A lot of guards,
too.

01:29:44.279 --> 01:29:47.981
SAM: He was an evil fiend. When he joined the
circus, who brought him in?

01:29:47.981 --> 01:29:50.738
TALIESIN: Let's not be throwing words around.

01:29:50.738 --> 01:29:53.978
SAM: No, he was literally an evil fiend.

01:29:53.978 --> 01:29:57.728
LAURA: He summoned imps.

01:29:57.728 --> 01:29:58.921
TALIESIN: He did summon--

01:29:58.921 --> 01:30:00.814
LAURA: He summoned imps, Yasha!

01:30:00.814 --> 01:30:02.666
SAM: He controlled the girl!

01:30:02.666 --> 01:30:05.028
TALIESIN: He was fine for years. Something set him
off.

01:30:05.139 --> 01:30:09.755
LIAM : Ah, he said it himself, you people in the
circus are weird, right? So, every once in a

01:30:09.755 --> 01:30:11.540
while, a glitch.

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:14.430
MARISHA: A glitch? What?

01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:20.266
TALIESIN: He was fine for so long. There was
nothing for so long. Why? Things don't just...

01:30:20.266 --> 01:30:23.487
MARISHA: I still think there's something creepy
about this lake, man.

01:30:23.487 --> 01:30:25.079
TALIESIN: Maybe?

01:30:25.079 --> 01:30:27.253
MARISHA: It gives me the heebie jeebies.

01:30:27.253 --> 01:30:28.960
TALIESIN: Everything gives me the heebie jeebies.

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:33.715
LIAM: Well, if it is this thing that we've read
about in the book, then perhaps he needed to feed

01:30:33.715 --> 01:30:35.780
more or was impatient for some reason?

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.418
ASHLEY: What's happened with Toya?

01:30:38.418 --> 01:30:39.822
TALIESIN: Shite.

01:30:39.822 --> 01:30:42.771
ASHLEY: How is she?

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:46.879
TALIESIN: She is not good. She is taking it as you
would expect.

01:30:46.879 --> 01:30:49.808
SAM: Also Beau crushed her windpipe.

01:30:49.808 --> 01:30:52.542
TALIESIN: That's true. With her stick.

01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:57.139
LIAM: And, I'm sorry, are we also taking the
bouncer into our little coven of weirdos. Is that

01:30:57.139 --> 01:30:58.515
a thing that's happening?

01:30:58.515 --> 01:30:59.546
ASHLEY: Oh, well--

01:30:59.546 --> 01:31:00.972
TALIESIN: Always.

01:31:00.972 --> 01:31:05.144
ASHLEY: I mean, I kind of go on my own, but--

01:31:05.144 --> 01:31:07.723
MARISHA: Yeah, she's one of us.

01:31:07.723 --> 01:31:10.075
TALIESIN: She's the charm, she has to come!

01:31:10.075 --> 01:31:14.245
LIAM: I'm too tired to argue. Let's get that
drink.

01:31:14.245 --> 01:31:18.819
TALIESIN: See, charm. Drink.

01:31:18.819 --> 01:31:23.568
MATT: As you make your way back to the Nestled
Nook Inn, within the tavern, and within the next

01:31:23.568 --> 01:31:30.887
hour or so, Gustav and Bosun, Toya and Ornna all
come in and join you. You guys crowd a few tables

01:31:30.887 --> 01:31:37.652
together, and under what is generally a pretty
empty tavern this night, you guys, for the most

01:31:37.793 --> 01:31:39.954
part, dominate the center space.

01:31:39.954 --> 01:31:45.183
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, Yasha, for new patrons, you're
going to have to surrender your sword.

01:31:45.183 --> 01:31:52.508
ASHLEY: (laughs) You're very funny.

01:31:52.508 --> 01:31:54.679
TALIESIN: He is very funny.

01:31:54.679 --> 01:31:57.738
LIAM: That is a very sick burn.

01:31:57.738 --> 01:32:00.119
MARISHA: Speaking of swords--

01:32:00.119 --> 01:32:04.914
LAURA: Careful Fjord, we haven't been healed yet,
you know. She could take you down.

01:32:04.914 --> 01:32:07.084
ASHLEY: You could always try to take it.

01:32:07.084 --> 01:32:08.237
TALIESIN: Arm wrestle.

01:32:08.237 --> 01:32:09.317
TRAVIS: I could, couldn't I?

01:32:09.317 --> 01:32:10.307
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:32:10.307 --> 01:32:12.357
MARISHA: Arm wrestle!

01:32:12.357 --> 01:32:16.240
ASHLEY: You do look pretty strong. I mean, you're
just a little bit bigger than me, but I still

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.133
think I could probably take you.

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:20.737
TRAVIS: Looks could be deceiving.

01:32:20.737 --> 01:32:22.523
MARISHA: Arm wrestle! Bets on Yasha.

01:32:22.523 --> 01:32:24.676
LAURA: Do it! Arm wrestle!

01:32:24.676 --> 01:32:27.579
TRAVIS: I just thought it would be a nice
gesture.

01:32:27.579 --> 01:32:29.217
LAURA: To arm wrestle?

01:32:29.217 --> 01:32:31.303
TRAVIS: No, to give up her sword.

01:32:31.303 --> 01:32:36.246
ASHLEY: What about your sword?

01:32:36.246 --> 01:32:39.484
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm a paying patron here. They know me
&lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; well.

01:32:39.484 --> 01:32:45.137
TALIESIN: So? You've got to be putting something
on the table, though. Well, if you want to

01:32:45.137 --> 01:32:46.920
surrender the sword or not surrender the sword.

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.088
TRAVIS: Did you want to stay in that room any
longer, Molly?

01:32:49.088 --> 01:32:50.658
TALIESIN: (laughs) Never.

01:32:50.658 --> 01:32:52.563
MARISHA: I don't know what we're talking about
anymore.

01:32:52.563 --> 01:32:53.734
LAURA: I don't either.

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:54.708
TRAVIS: Let's get a drink.

01:32:54.708 --> 01:32:55.800
MARISHA: Are you guys going to arm wrestle?

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:56.512
TRAVIS: No.

01:32:56.512 --> 01:33:03.321
MARISHA: Okay. How about "Boulder, Paper, Shears"?
Wait, what is it? "Boulder, Parchment, Shears"!

01:33:03.321 --> 01:33:05.031
TALIESIN: That's a stupid game.

01:33:05.031 --> 01:33:06.509
SAM: I never heard of that game.

01:33:06.509 --> 01:33:12.007
ASHLEY: I think it's something that kids play. I
have a better version of that game. We can play it

01:33:12.007 --> 01:33:13.224
later.

01:33:13.224 --> 01:33:17.772
MATT: The rest of the carnival in presence, Gustav
goes and orders a round of drinks to all of you

01:33:17.772 --> 01:33:25.872
and then sits down. Toya still looks a bit shaken,
but seems to be comforted with the rest of the

01:33:25.872 --> 01:33:30.688
family around her, that still remain at least.
Desmond's come and joined as well. As you're all

01:33:30.688 --> 01:33:34.297
sitting together for a bit, there's a moment of
quiet as you're all sipping, and just tiredly

01:33:34.297 --> 01:33:46.417
thinking over the events of the evening. Toya
breaks the silence, "Is the family going away? Am

01:33:46.417 --> 01:33:53.700
I going to be alone again?" Ornna looks over at
her and goes, "Not if I can help it. It's you and

01:33:53.700 --> 01:34:02.684
me, kid, against the world." Bosun pats Ornna on
the shoulder and says, "Well, if you'd have me,

01:34:02.684 --> 01:34:09.281
you can probably use a strong arm." Ornna looks
back at him. Ornna and him have had this

01:34:09.345 --> 01:34:15.643
rivalry tension for a while. She goes, "You know
what? Sure. The trio makes for a strong pack of

01:34:15.643 --> 01:34:23.116
performers. Desmond, are you in?" And Desmond is
just sitting there, staring into his cup and goes,

01:34:23.116 --> 01:34:33.629
"I see a new family before me. And one I fear
that's a story I could only spoil. No, I thank

01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:44.416
you, but I'll find my own path." And he just sits
there kind of quietly in this somewhat sad space.

01:34:44.416 --> 01:34:57.599
He gives a brief pat and side hug to Bosun before
standing up and leaving. Gustav stands up and

01:34:57.599 --> 01:35:09.450
looks around. "I'm sorry for everything. For all
the pain this has caused you, for all the pain

01:35:09.450 --> 01:35:16.017
it's caused you." Looks at Toya, "For all the pain
it's caused you, little one."

01:35:16.439 --> 01:35:22.181
TRAVIS: We had quite the adventure, actually. I
know people were hurt, but that was really

01:35:22.181 --> 01:35:24.367
something.

01:35:24.367 --> 01:35:29.131
MARISHA: And apparently, nobody really cared about
Enon, so that's, you know, good for your

01:35:29.131 --> 01:35:31.668
conscience.

01:35:31.668 --> 01:35:37.399
MATT: "Everyone's conscience is heavy with its own
reasoning."

01:35:37.399 --> 01:35:41.013
TALIESIN: Get no blame from me.

01:35:41.013 --> 01:35:45.900
MATT: "I appreciate that. We are our own worst
enemy, are we not?"

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:48.318
TALIESIN: Ah, cheers to that!

01:35:48.318 --> 01:35:53.741
LIAM: I catch Nott's eye and silently mouth the
word 'lunatics'.

01:35:53.741 --> 01:35:56.902
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:35:56.902 --> 01:36:05.097
MATT: "Well, I think that's the end of my
carnival." (laughs)

01:36:05.097 --> 01:36:07.017
LAURA: It was such a good carnival.

01:36:07.017 --> 01:36:09.537
MATT: "It was a good run! It was a really good
run."

01:36:09.537 --> 01:36:13.016
MARISHA: Man, we caught the last show, you guys!

01:36:13.016 --> 01:36:14.933
TALIESIN: Not our best show.

01:36:14.933 --> 01:36:16.615
LAURA: I liked it.

01:36:16.615 --> 01:36:18.724
SAM: The tickets are probably worth something!

01:36:18.724 --> 01:36:19.819
MARISHA: They might!

01:36:19.819 --> 01:36:21.232
TRAVIS: Closed it down.

01:36:21.232 --> 01:36:22.645
MARISHA: I'm gonna keep this flyer.

01:36:22.645 --> 01:36:24.059
TALIESIN: You have plans?

01:36:26.025 --> 01:36:30.392
ASHLEY: No, I'm just going to float around like I
usually do.

01:36:30.392 --> 01:36:40.168
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm thinking about it. I
don't know where I'm going to end up now.

01:36:40.168 --> 01:36:47.240
MATT: "You can go with Bosun and Ornna, if you
like. You guys are still carrying on. I mean, I'm

01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.583
not going to keep the tent, I'm not going to keep
the supplies. I might hock some of it to try and

01:36:51.583 --> 01:36:59.824
pay off my debt, but-- take what you want. Start
anew. It's my gift to you." They all kind of,

01:36:59.824 --> 01:37:07.981
"Thank you very much. We'll start small, I don't
think we need too much of the ensemble. How we

01:37:07.981 --> 01:37:11.559
began, back up in Shady Creek."

01:37:13.509 --> 01:37:18.586
LAURA: I mean, I could use a really large tent.
Like the biggest one? I would take that off your

01:37:18.639 --> 01:37:19.682
hands.

01:37:19.682 --> 01:37:20.993
TALIESIN: The biggest one's a bit--

01:37:20.993 --> 01:37:23.051
TRAVIS: What would you do with a really large
tent?

01:37:23.051 --> 01:37:30.898
LAURA: I don't know, I could open up a hotel? Or I
could make a bunch of dresses. Or--

01:37:30.898 --> 01:37:32.381
SAM: Out of the tent?

01:37:32.381 --> 01:37:33.297
LAURA: Yeah!

01:37:33.297 --> 01:37:35.594
TALIESIN: You could make a lot of dresses out of
that tent. That's fair.

01:37:35.594 --> 01:37:37.147
LAURA: Yeah, right? It's really pretty fabric.

01:37:37.147 --> 01:37:38.545
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:43.249
LAURA: (gasps) A hot air balloon!

01:37:43.453 --> 01:37:44.958
TALIESIN: I don't--

01:37:44.958 --> 01:37:46.216
LIAM: A what?

01:37:46.216 --> 01:37:48.308
SAM: Those aren't invented.

01:37:48.308 --> 01:37:50.310
LAURA: Haven't you seen airships?

01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:51.514
SAM: No!

01:37:51.514 --> 01:37:56.710
LIAM: They generally run from crystals. I've seen
that kind before.

01:37:56.710 --> 01:37:57.789
LAURA: Yeah!

01:37:57.789 --> 01:38:00.593
LIAM: Yeah, there's no balloons, though. What's a
balloon?

01:38:00.593 --> 01:38:05.297
MATT: They have simple dirigibles, but they're not
very functional.

01:38:05.297 --> 01:38:09.860
LAURA: Yeah, it just involves fire you guys. We
can figure this shit out.

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:13.463
LIAM: Oh, a dirigible? Dirigible I've heard of,
but a balloon? I don't know what that is.

01:38:13.463 --> 01:38:15.623
MARISHA: Have the airships made it to this
continent yet?

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:17.562
LIAM: You don't know.

01:38:17.562 --> 01:38:18.997
SAM: I think, Jester--

01:38:18.997 --> 01:38:21.642
LAURA: I've seen airships, okay? I've seen them.

01:38:21.642 --> 01:38:26.241
SAM: Jester, I think it's safe to say that this
first case is closed!

01:38:26.241 --> 01:38:27.898
LAURA: (gasps)

01:38:27.898 --> 01:38:31.272
SAM: So we could open some sort of private
investigation service.

01:38:31.272 --> 01:38:32.476
LAURA: That's what we should do!

01:38:32.476 --> 01:38:34.577
SAM: Out of a tent.

01:38:34.577 --> 01:38:38.691
LAURA: Let's not open it here, though. This town
sucks!

01:38:38.691 --> 01:38:41.725
TRAVIS: Yeah, we were still planning on moving on
after this.

01:38:41.725 --> 01:38:45.653
MATT: "Bosun and Ornna, you guys can use that
tent, right?" "Yeah, I think we'll take the tent."

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:46.771
"All right."

01:38:46.771 --> 01:38:49.025
SAM: Aw, they took the tent.

01:38:49.025 --> 01:38:52.272
LAURA: Aw. We waited too long!

01:38:52.272 --> 01:38:55.770
SAM: You got to jump on the tent when it becomes
available.

01:38:55.770 --> 01:39:02.499
LIAM: You know, just out of curiosity, what's
everybody plan to do now?

01:39:02.499 --> 01:39:06.485
SAM: Well do we have to leave? I mean I'm not
wanted anymore.

01:39:06.485 --> 01:39:11.747
LIAM: You were never wanted. Back to my
question--

01:39:11.747 --> 01:39:16.816
LAURA: Fjord and I are going to try and get him
into the Academy.

01:39:16.816 --> 01:39:22.533
TRAVIS: Well, I wanted to find out more about the
Soltrice Academy, yes. I didn't know what

01:39:22.533 --> 01:39:27.348
direction you were heading. I never even asked
what you were doing here in the first place.

01:39:27.348 --> 01:39:32.664
MARISHA: Oh, you know, I'm just doing a walking
tour? Through the continent, just kind of--

01:39:32.664 --> 01:39:33.844
TRAVIS: A walking tour?

01:39:33.844 --> 01:39:38.881
MARISHA: Yeah, just like a backpack vacation, you
know? Just stretch my legs a little bit. Meeting

01:39:38.881 --> 01:39:44.520
some fine people. Discovering myself.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.419
TRAVIS: Are you on a vacation?

01:39:46.419 --> 01:39:48.170
MARISHA: Yes.

01:39:48.170 --> 01:39:51.538
TRAVIS: Bring a lot of money with you for that
vacation, did you?

01:39:51.538 --> 01:39:54.237
MARISHA: What's it matter to you?

01:39:54.237 --> 01:39:59.009
TRAVIS: I don't believe you're on vacation. Where
are you going?

01:39:59.009 --> 01:40:07.360
MARISHA: (laughs) That's your problem. So, you
guys going to take off or do you guys want company

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.960
or-- ?

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.331
MATT: Gustav finishes the drink and goes, "Well,
I'm going to go get some sleep and try and figure

01:40:13.331 --> 01:40:17.038
out how to put my life together. I bid you all a
wonderful night--"

01:40:17.038 --> 01:40:25.131
LAURA: Gustav, wait! Here. And I take off one of
my rings. This is an old family heirloom, and I

01:40:25.131 --> 01:40:30.109
hope it can help you pay some of your debt.

01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:34.934
TALIESIN: I want to spy the rings on her hand, by
the way, really quickly.

01:40:34.934 --> 01:40:37.732
MATT: "Looks just like the one I lost off my
pinky."

01:40:37.732 --> 01:40:41.193
LAURA: Well, that's so weird that you and my
family have the same looking ones.

01:40:41.193 --> 01:40:42.968
MATT: "That's wonderful, thank you so much."

01:40:42.968 --> 01:40:43.760
LAURA: You're welcome.

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.290
MATT: "That's very sweet."

01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:48.996
TALIESIN: I want to look at the other rings she
picked up, not that she's wearing right now.

01:40:48.996 --> 01:40:51.343
LAURA: They're right here. You can get a look at
them!

01:40:51.343 --> 01:40:53.019
MATT: They're all over her fingers.

01:40:53.019 --> 01:40:55.870
TALIESIN: They are obviously rings from random
dead people, aren't they?

01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:56.818
MATT: Yeah.

01:40:56.818 --> 01:40:58.965
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm just putting that together.

01:41:02.405 --> 01:41:04.862
LAURA: I play dinosaur fights.

01:41:04.974 --> 01:41:12.710
MATT: Gustav puts his hat on. "Yasha, be safe, and
punch anyone who gets in your way."

01:41:12.710 --> 01:41:14.466
ASHLEY: I will.

01:41:14.466 --> 01:41:18.799
MATT: "Mollymauk, I hope you find what you're
looking for."

01:41:18.799 --> 01:41:21.045
TALIESIN: I think I will.

01:41:21.045 --> 01:41:29.445
MATT: "To the new family, don't make the same
mistakes your forefathers did. The rest of you,

01:41:29.445 --> 01:41:30.777
thank you."

01:41:30.777 --> 01:41:32.785
LAURA: (whispers) He said forefathers.

01:41:32.785 --> 01:41:34.438
SAM: (whispers) That's progressive.

01:41:34.438 --> 01:41:36.510
(laughter)

01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:38.944
MATT: "I bid you all adieu," and he exits.

01:41:38.944 --> 01:41:42.397
LAURA: What are you looking for, Molly?

01:41:42.397 --> 01:41:47.036
TALIESIN: Hmm, I'm not quite done with this one.
We'll see.

01:41:47.036 --> 01:41:49.236
ASHLEY: Toya.

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:53.727
MATT: Bosun and Ornna stood up and Toya is there,
"Yeah?"

01:41:53.727 --> 01:41:56.929
ASHLEY: What are your plans? What do you want to
do?

01:41:56.929 --> 01:42:07.408
MATT: "I figure I'll just move on with Bo and
Ornna and make a new show. Something with a little

01:42:07.408 --> 01:42:14.008
less death. That's what I'd like."

01:42:14.008 --> 01:42:20.382
LAURA: You should make your way to the Menagerie
Coast. I think you guys would have a lot of

01:42:20.382 --> 01:42:23.164
success in Nicodranas.

01:42:23.164 --> 01:42:24.907
MATT: "I haven't been to Nicodranas."

01:42:24.907 --> 01:42:27.159
LAURA: It's &lt;i&gt;beautiful&lt;/i&gt;.

01:42:27.159 --> 01:42:33.537
MATT: She looks up and tugs on the side of Bosun's
sleeve. "You know, I actually haven't been there

01:42:33.537 --> 01:42:35.286
either."

01:42:35.286 --> 01:42:39.063
LAURA: They're always looking for good performers.
You would do well.

01:42:39.063 --> 01:42:46.642
MATT: "Hmm. Let's go ahead and make our way. That
sounds like a nice change of pace, and this empire

01:42:46.642 --> 01:42:50.315
is getting a little stuffy for me anyway."

01:42:50.315 --> 01:42:56.277
MARISHA: I've bend down to Toya, and I take off
one of the little jade bangles around my wrist,

01:42:56.277 --> 01:43:07.457
and I say, "Here. This will keep you safe from
assholes named Beau. Except for that asshole,

01:43:07.457 --> 01:43:11.434
named Bo. He's a good Bo, but all other assholes
named Beau."

01:43:11.434 --> 01:43:15.822
MATT: You watch as Ornna elbows him and is like,
"Oh, no, he's an asshole too. It's fine."

01:43:15.822 --> 01:43:16.871
TALIESIN: It's true.

01:43:16.871 --> 01:43:19.890
MARISHA: Sorry. Sorry again about that.

01:43:19.890 --> 01:43:27.094
MATT: She takes it and goes, "It's okay. I know
you did what you had to. But when I'm older, I'm

01:43:27.094 --> 01:43:29.093
going to get you back."

01:43:29.093 --> 01:43:31.534
MARISHA: You better.

01:43:31.534 --> 01:43:33.449
LAURA: Your first nemesis!

01:43:33.449 --> 01:43:35.061
MARISHA: My first nemesis!

01:43:35.061 --> 01:43:36.988
MATT: Is a twelve year old girl!

01:43:36.988 --> 01:43:38.244
(laughter)

01:43:38.244 --> 01:43:42.155
MARISHA: I give her a little chin (weak punch
sound).

01:43:42.155 --> 01:43:43.611
TRAVIS: She goes unconscious.

01:43:43.611 --> 01:43:46.092
(laughter)

01:43:46.092 --> 01:43:49.733
MARISHA: Aw, why? No!

01:43:49.733 --> 01:43:57.115
MATT: The three of them stand up and give a nod,
wordlessly look over the rest of you with a smile

01:43:57.115 --> 01:44:06.102
of thanks, and Bosun looks to you and makes eye
contact and goes, "Take care, brother. It gets

01:44:06.102 --> 01:44:09.298
tougher for us up north."

01:44:09.298 --> 01:44:11.856
TRAVIS: I'll keep that in mind.

01:44:11.856 --> 01:44:14.816
MATT: And they all leave the inn.

01:44:18.777 --> 01:44:22.922
ASHLEY: I mean, I'll say it. I don't know if you
will, but I think that little girl is creepy.

01:44:22.922 --> 01:44:25.529
(laughter)

01:44:25.529 --> 01:44:32.624
TALIESIN: Oh no, she's had a thing the entire
time. There was a little while I thought she was

01:44:32.624 --> 01:44:34.289
in on it completely.

01:44:34.289 --> 01:44:35.164
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:44:35.164 --> 01:44:36.434
LAURA: I mean, she might have been.

01:44:36.434 --> 01:44:38.453
TALIESIN: I've known her for years. I just assumed
that she was in on it.

01:44:38.453 --> 01:44:41.359
LAURA: She could've been in on it, and just got
right away with it.

01:44:41.359 --> 01:44:44.003
TALIESIN: Yeah. That would be great.

01:44:44.003 --> 01:44:45.368
LAURA: She's good.

01:44:45.368 --> 01:44:48.348
MARISHA: For her, yeah, I mean I got to give it to
her, yeah.

01:44:48.348 --> 01:44:52.260
TALIESIN: You know, no matter what you pick,
you're always welcome, right?

01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:53.110
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:44:53.110 --> 01:44:54.615
TALIESIN: Wherever you end up.

01:44:54.615 --> 01:44:58.218
ASHLEY: Maybe for a little bit, but I've got some
things I need do, so.

01:44:58.218 --> 01:45:00.677
LAURA: Do you guys want to travel with me and
Fjord?

01:45:00.677 --> 01:45:04.454
ASHLEY: Where are you going, again?

01:45:04.454 --> 01:45:07.210
TRAVIS: Up north. Northeast to the Solstryce
Academy.

01:45:07.210 --> 01:45:08.807
LIAM: Straight there.

01:45:08.807 --> 01:45:10.577
TALIESIN: Northeast. I've always wanted to go
there.

01:45:10.577 --> 01:45:14.004
ASHLEY: Where's... where northeast?

01:45:14.004 --> 01:45:15.867
LAURA: Um...

01:45:16.661 --> 01:45:18.531
(chuckles)

01:45:18.531 --> 01:45:19.829
SAM: We're here.

01:45:19.829 --> 01:45:21.320
(laughter)

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.709
MATT: Well technically, you don't have a map.

01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:25.128
SAM: Oh, no.

01:45:25.128 --> 01:45:29.843
LAURA: We should really get a map, you guys. I
haven't spent a lot of time in this area and I

01:45:29.843 --> 01:45:32.925
don't really know where we're going.

01:45:32.925 --> 01:45:37.979
TRAVIS: We're kind of going from town to town and
asking as we go. Afraid we don't know too much.

01:45:37.979 --> 01:45:42.654
LAURA: I wonder if there's a place-- maybe at the
general store? They would have a map? Or do you

01:45:42.654 --> 01:45:45.037
have to go to a map maker?

01:45:45.037 --> 01:45:46.990
TALIESIN: Traditionally, you have to go to a map
maker.

01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:48.784
MATT: Traditionally but it can depend.

01:45:48.784 --> 01:45:50.950
TALIESIN: We might have a bit of something at the
circus, I don't know.

01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:53.261
ASHLEY: I would love a map.

01:45:53.261 --> 01:45:56.858
LAURA: We'll go looking for things tomorrow. We
can go shopping.

01:45:57.772 --> 01:46:00.041
ASHLEY: Okay. We'll go shopping with you.

01:46:00.041 --> 01:46:01.261
LAURA: Yeah.

01:46:01.261 --> 01:46:07.331
MARISHA: Where are you guys heading off to? Seems
like people are making pretty big plans.

01:46:07.331 --> 01:46:09.496
TRAVIS: There's safety in numbers, you know?

01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:13.009
LIAM: Yeah. Took the words out of my mouth.

01:46:13.009 --> 01:46:17.316
LAURA: Nott, don't you want to travel with us,
too?

01:46:17.316 --> 01:46:21.081
SAM: Um, is she coming?

01:46:21.081 --> 01:46:23.078
LAURA: Yeah, she just said she was.

01:46:23.078 --> 01:46:24.622
ASHLEY: Oh, are you scared of me?

01:46:24.622 --> 01:46:26.679
SAM: A little bit. You're very big.

01:46:26.679 --> 01:46:31.266
ASHLEY: Well, I thought you were Nott, the Brave?

01:46:31.266 --> 01:46:34.492
SAM: Oh. No, there's no comma.

01:46:34.492 --> 01:46:36.144
LAURA: (laughs)

01:46:36.144 --> 01:46:37.896
SAM: I'm just Nott the Brave.

01:46:37.896 --> 01:46:41.947
(laughter)

01:46:48.962 --> 01:46:53.433
LIAM: I don't know. You know, Nott and I have been
travelling together for a while and two is better

01:46:53.433 --> 01:46:57.549
than one, although still very difficult.

01:46:57.549 --> 01:47:01.054
MARISHA: How long ago was it that you guys broke
out of prison?

01:47:01.054 --> 01:47:06.951
LIAM: Uh... you know, it was six months ago,
about. Five, six months ago.

01:47:06.951 --> 01:47:08.905
MARISHA: Damn, you guys are doing good.

01:47:08.905 --> 01:47:10.315
TALIESIN: Insight check.

01:47:10.315 --> 01:47:11.358
MATT: Against--

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:13.124
TALIESIN: Five or six months ago.

01:47:13.124 --> 01:47:14.405
MATT: Yeah.

01:47:15.407 --> 01:47:16.837
LAURA: Oh, that was so close.

01:47:16.837 --> 01:47:18.234
TALIESIN: 14.

01:47:18.234 --> 01:47:19.480
SAM: You have to roll, don't you?

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:20.821
LAURA: Yeah.

01:47:20.821 --> 01:47:23.861
MATT: Roll either persuasion or deception. You can
choose. Don't--

01:47:23.861 --> 01:47:25.861
LIAM: I'll do persuasion.

01:47:25.861 --> 01:47:28.618
MATT: I mean, you don't have to say but you did.
That's fine.

01:47:28.618 --> 01:47:33.799
LIAM: That's uh, I don't know where on my
character sheet is. That's also a 14.

01:47:33.799 --> 01:47:34.506
LAURA: Oh.

01:47:34.506 --> 01:47:36.310
MATT: All right, so seems on the level.

01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:37.650
TALIESIN: All right.

01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:40.042
LAURA: (laughs)

01:47:40.042 --> 01:47:43.104
TRAVIS: Broke out of prison? That's very
impressive.

01:47:43.104 --> 01:47:51.533
SAM: Well, it was mainly Caleb. We had to get out.
I mean, it was a bad place.

01:47:51.533 --> 01:47:52.986
LAURA: Were they going to kill you?

01:47:52.986 --> 01:47:55.165
SAM: We would have died, for sure.

01:47:55.165 --> 01:47:58.365
ASHLEY: But you guys were there together? Because
you knew each other before?

01:47:58.365 --> 01:48:03.328
LIAM: Well, first of all, she's being modest. It
was not just me at all, I could not have gotten

01:48:03.328 --> 01:48:07.532
out of there without you. I don't think you could
have gotten out of there without me either but you

01:48:07.532 --> 01:48:08.225
know.

01:48:08.225 --> 01:48:09.529
SAM: That's true, for sure.

01:48:09.529 --> 01:48:13.430
LIAM: That's why I said two. Better than one. One
is the loneliest number.

01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:15.348
LAURA: That you'll ever see.

01:48:15.348 --> 01:48:16.585
LIAM: Yeah.

01:48:16.585 --> 01:48:19.671
MARISHA: There's nothing wrong with being alone.

01:48:19.671 --> 01:48:23.996
LIAM: You know, normally I wouldn't feel
comfortable talking about shit like this but you

01:48:23.996 --> 01:48:26.991
are all very shifty.

01:48:26.991 --> 01:48:28.601
LAURA: I'm very trustworthy.

01:48:28.601 --> 01:48:29.627
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:48:29.627 --> 01:48:32.305
LIAM: No, no, no, you're shifty as well. Yeah.

01:48:32.305 --> 01:48:33.649
TALIESIN: It's true.

01:48:33.649 --> 01:48:37.809
TRAVIS: In the short time we've spent with you,
you seem to be very upstanding folks. I'm sure it

01:48:37.809 --> 01:48:40.281
wasn't for anything too serious.

01:48:40.281 --> 01:48:46.155
LIAM: No, nothing serious at all, really. I was
too curious. She was maybe a little thirsty. You

01:48:46.155 --> 01:48:49.940
know, petty stuff.

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:54.166
SAM: But they treated us very badly and we needed
to get out of there.

01:48:54.166 --> 01:48:56.230
LIAM: We all know how this country works.

01:48:56.230 --> 01:48:57.678
MARISHA: And where was 'there'?

01:48:57.678 --> 01:49:00.123
TRAVIS: Yeah, is there anywhere we should stay
away from on our travels?

01:49:00.123 --> 01:49:01.499
LIAM: (clears throat)

01:49:01.499 --> 01:49:06.913
SAM: Any place is-- I mean, we've been travelling
around a bit but--

01:49:06.913 --> 01:49:09.860
LIAM: You know, I wouldn't go west, maybe.

01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.685
TALIESIN: Northwest.

01:49:11.685 --> 01:49:15.740
SAM: I'm told east is bad too. There's monsters.

01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:20.426
LIAM: Yeah and they're pretty terrible in the
north. That's no secret.

01:49:20.426 --> 01:49:22.015
LAURA: So we go south?

01:49:22.015 --> 01:49:23.474
SAM: Oh no, not south.

01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:26.711
(laughter)

01:49:26.711 --> 01:49:31.112
ASHLEY: It just depends where in the south,
actually.

01:49:31.112 --> 01:49:39.542
TALIESIN: I'd be happy keeping a bit of a low-key
existence.

01:49:39.542 --> 01:49:45.254
LAURA: Well, I mean we are vigilantes so it's best
if we, you know, have our secrets.

01:49:45.254 --> 01:49:48.691
TALIESIN: Some of us are a bit sketchy with the
law.

01:49:48.909 --> 01:49:50.088
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:49:50.088 --> 01:49:56.396
LIAM: Mollymauk, you're comfortable leaving the
circus? You are very-- you have a lot of flair.

01:49:56.396 --> 01:50:02.173
TALIESIN: Well, I figured if you're going to live
your life, you're going to live your life.

01:50:02.173 --> 01:50:03.958
LAURA: (jingling)

01:50:03.958 --> 01:50:07.718
TALIESIN: Does do that. There's nothing wrong with
living your life. You only get one of them, or

01:50:07.718 --> 01:50:16.440
mostly. And your days are going to be the days
that you're going to have and I'd like to keep

01:50:16.505 --> 01:50:21.747
living my life the way I'd like to and keep off of
certain radars.

01:50:21.747 --> 01:50:23.182
MARISHA: Cheers to that.

01:50:23.182 --> 01:50:25.072
LAURA: Yeah. Life does need things to live.

01:50:25.072 --> 01:50:26.813
(laughter)

01:50:26.813 --> 01:50:28.766
TALIESIN: Stupid phrase.

01:50:28.766 --> 01:50:30.503
LIAM: That doesn't make any sense at all.

01:50:30.503 --> 01:50:31.940
TALIESIN: Really stupid.

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:33.165
TRAVIS: Who said that?

01:50:33.165 --> 01:50:36.227
LIAM: I mean, it does but it blatantly obvious and
simplistic.

01:50:36.227 --> 01:50:39.473
(laughter)

01:50:39.473 --> 01:50:40.828
TALIESIN: That's just ridiculous.

01:50:40.828 --> 01:50:44.593
(laughter)

01:50:44.593 --> 01:50:49.160
TALIESIN: That felt so good. That's catharsis.

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:54.431
TRAVIS: Yasha, anywhere that we should avoid for
you?

01:50:54.745 --> 01:51:05.384
ASHLEY: You know. I'm just-- I'll make my way
wherever we go and maybe I'll not stay with you

01:51:05.384 --> 01:51:11.945
the whole time but I don't like, you know--

01:51:11.945 --> 01:51:13.170
TRAVIS: Being confined.

01:51:13.170 --> 01:51:15.860
ASHLEY: Yeah. I don't-- groups and things--

01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:17.450
MARISHA: Are you claustrophobic?

01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:18.837
ASHLEY: Uh, no.

01:51:18.837 --> 01:51:22.787
MARISHA: You mentioned the smaller cl--cramped space
in the cell. Just curious.

01:51:22.787 --> 01:51:24.218
LAURA: Clamp space?

01:51:24.218 --> 01:51:25.743
MARISHA: Clamps-- clampy space.

01:51:25.743 --> 01:51:27.425
TALIESIN: Clam space.

01:51:27.425 --> 01:51:29.990
ASHLEY: I like to have my freedom.

01:51:30.066 --> 01:51:34.290
LIAM: I mean, technically this is a group. You
mean groups bigger than this group or is this

01:51:34.290 --> 01:51:36.377
group too claustrophobic for you or-- ?

01:51:36.377 --> 01:51:40.796
ASHLEY: No. I don't mean it like that. I just want
to make my own way sometimes.

01:51:40.796 --> 01:51:43.753
MARISHA: Not tied down to anything but that cloak,
am I right?

01:51:43.753 --> 01:51:47.144
ASHLEY: (chuckles) Yeah, that's right.

01:51:48.674 --> 01:51:51.879
LAURA: Speaking of cloaks, mine smells really
bad.

01:51:52.152 --> 01:51:57.341
SAM: It was on top of a head. Ugh, that's really
gross.

01:51:57.341 --> 01:52:00.660
LAURA: I'm going to go try to find somewhere to
wash it.

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:05.148
MATT: Upstairs at the end of the hallway is a
communal washroom. You can find space there.

01:52:05.148 --> 01:52:06.289
LAURA: Hey Caleb!

01:52:06.289 --> 01:52:07.001
LIAM: Yeah?

01:52:07.001 --> 01:52:08.572
LAURA: You know what's upstairs?

01:52:08.572 --> 01:52:09.477
(laughter)

01:52:09.477 --> 01:52:12.886
LAURA: This place where I'm going to go wash some
stuff. You could use it.

01:52:12.886 --> 01:52:14.842
TALIESIN: You smell fine.

01:52:14.842 --> 01:52:17.125
LAURA and MARISHA: (chuckles)

01:52:17.125 --> 01:52:20.496
SAM: I like you just the way you are.

01:52:20.496 --> 01:52:26.421
LAURA: You're bloody now, too, in addition to
being stinky.

01:52:26.421 --> 01:52:29.281
TALIESIN: You should probably get that patched up,
actually, though. That is fair.

01:52:29.281 --> 01:52:30.481
LIAM: (clears throat)

01:52:30.481 --> 01:52:33.056
MARISHA: Yeah, I actually feel like you're
starting to get a rash.

01:52:33.056 --> 01:52:37.211
(laughter)

01:52:37.211 --> 01:52:38.435
LIAM: Yeah, I'm good, thank you.

01:52:38.435 --> 01:52:40.223
(laughter)

01:52:40.223 --> 01:52:41.132
TRAVIS: Damn right.

01:52:41.132 --> 01:52:43.903
(laughter)

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.916
MATT: All right.

01:52:48.598 --> 01:52:54.370
SAM: Well, I suppose we should all go to sleep and
then if any of us are here in the morning, we'll

01:52:54.370 --> 01:52:55.977
set off together?

01:52:55.977 --> 01:52:57.666
TRAVIS: That seems fair.

01:52:57.666 --> 01:53:01.893
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that. Collect our
things from-- my things, anyway, from the circus.

01:53:01.893 --> 01:53:03.473
There should be some spares.

01:53:03.473 --> 01:53:07.429
LIAM: Do we have time to-- look at this, we're
making plans with friends, that's amazing. Do we

01:53:07.429 --> 01:53:10.764
have for errands in the morning? I have a couple
stops. Nothing major.

01:53:10.764 --> 01:53:12.184
TALIESIN: Take me a while to pack.

01:53:12.184 --> 01:53:13.325
LIAM: Yeah.

01:53:13.325 --> 01:53:15.434
MARISHA: You guys want me to tag along with you?

01:53:15.434 --> 01:53:18.788
TRAVIS: If you weren't too anxious to run off
anywhere.

01:53:18.788 --> 01:53:27.028
MARISHA: (chuckles, clears throat) No. I'm free on
my backpack tour. No plans.

01:53:27.028 --> 01:53:31.480
TRAVIS: Right. Any sightseeing we should schedule
along our way?

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:37.403
MARISHA: Maybe avoid Zadash just because I just
came there, you know. Don't want to hit the same

01:53:37.403 --> 01:53:38.617
place twice.

01:53:38.617 --> 01:53:39.801
TRAVIS: Zadash?

01:53:39.801 --> 01:53:40.807
MARISHA: Yup.

01:53:40.807 --> 01:53:42.209
TRAVIS: Keep that in mind.

01:53:42.209 --> 01:53:47.908
(laughter)

01:53:47.908 --> 01:53:49.619
TALIESIN: Note, note, note.

01:53:49.619 --> 01:53:55.181
MATT: As you guys are all finishing your drinks
and standing up to leave the table, a familiar

01:53:55.181 --> 01:54:02.008
voice pipes in from the center of the tavern.
"Beauregard?"

01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:06.309
MARISHA: (groans)

01:54:06.309 --> 01:54:14.428
MATT: And the Archivist who was there earlier
during the trial in the stockade. "It's been

01:54:14.428 --> 01:54:19.377
difficult to find you. Do you mind if we speak?"

01:54:19.377 --> 01:54:28.324
MARISHA: Hey, Zeenoth! Hey. It's been all of about
twenty minutes since I've seen you last.

01:54:28.324 --> 01:54:35.612
MATT: "Yes, um, would you walk with me? I believe
we have much to discuss."

01:54:35.612 --> 01:54:38.288
MARISHA: Okay.

01:54:38.288 --> 01:54:43.583
MATT: "Don't worry. She'll be returned to you.
Just--"

01:54:43.583 --> 01:54:45.829
TRAVIS: You all right with this?

01:54:45.829 --> 01:54:48.469
MARISHA: It's cool. I've got it.

01:54:48.469 --> 01:54:50.311
TALIESIN: We don't care. We're not that attached
yet.

01:54:50.311 --> 01:54:51.734
LAURA: (laughs)

01:54:51.734 --> 01:54:56.255
MATT: "All right then. This way please,
Beauregard."

01:54:56.255 --> 01:54:58.657
MARISHA: (sighs)

01:54:58.657 --> 01:55:03.660
MATT: The elvish man gives a bow and he seems
jovial.

01:55:08.154 --> 01:55:10.081
(laughter)

01:55:10.081 --> 01:55:12.593
TALIESIN: More mine, more mine!

01:55:12.593 --> 01:55:17.197
MATT: Beau leaves and you guys are able to go
about the rest of your evening to rest however you

01:55:17.197 --> 01:55:19.664
see fit.

01:55:19.664 --> 01:55:25.629
LIAM: Way up after Nott has gone, I go over to
Norda. Is Norda down there?

01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:27.592
SAM: Yorda.

01:55:27.592 --> 01:55:30.724
LIAM: No, there's two people with rhyming names.

01:55:30.724 --> 01:55:32.664
MARISHA: Yorda is the bartender.

01:55:32.664 --> 01:55:34.117
MATT: Yorda is the bartender.

01:55:34.126 --> 01:55:36.264
LIAM: This is revenge for Vex and Vax.

01:55:36.403 --> 01:55:37.824
MATT: Yeah, and Purvon.

01:55:37.824 --> 01:55:40.949
LIAM: I find the purveyor of the establishment.

01:55:40.949 --> 01:55:42.411
MATT: Yorda.

01:55:42.411 --> 01:55:44.737
LIAM: Mork from Ork, that's what I said.

01:55:44.737 --> 01:55:47.458
MATT: "Right, what can I help you with?"

01:55:47.674 --> 01:55:58.520
LIAM: Excuse me, is there-- I know you have a bath
here, but is there a hot bath place like a

01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:06.451
bathhouse? I'm bruised over every inch of my body
and I'm in a lot of pain.

01:56:06.451 --> 01:56:11.368
MATT: "Right, that'll probably be in the
Hillsward. It's a bit pricey, but I don't know if

01:56:11.368 --> 01:56:12.538
it's open this late."

01:56:12.538 --> 01:56:14.718
LIAM: I know, but how much are we talking about?

01:56:14.718 --> 01:56:20.084
MATT: "Oh, I'd put it maybe somewhere in the
neighborhood of five silver for a bath."

01:56:20.084 --> 01:56:22.163
LIAM: That's expensive.

01:56:22.163 --> 01:56:27.068
MATT: "But you get bathed like proper, multiple
people bathing you."

01:56:27.068 --> 01:56:28.563
LIAM: Northward, you say?

01:56:28.563 --> 01:56:30.374
MATT: "No, Hillsward."

01:56:30.374 --> 01:56:33.613
LIAM: Okay, good.

01:56:33.613 --> 01:56:42.327
MATT: "I mean, no offense to you. Their clientele
is a bit, upper class."

01:56:42.327 --> 01:56:44.430
LIAM: I'm not worried.

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:46.455
MATT: "Alright, fair enough."

01:56:46.455 --> 01:56:50.691
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Danke&lt;/i&gt;. And I head up there.

01:56:50.749 --> 01:56:59.661
MATT: Okay. Beau, as you exit with Zeenoth. As
soon as you step into the night air, a second

01:56:59.661 --> 01:57:04.308
figure flanks your other side. The hooded figure
from earlier that had caught you.

01:57:04.308 --> 01:57:09.156
MARISHA: I just look at Zeenoth and go really? Is
this really necessary?

01:57:09.156 --> 01:57:17.301
MATT: "It is only because it's been so difficult
to find you. I had to call in a favor. Please,

01:57:17.301 --> 01:57:19.806
come with us. We have a warehouse."

01:57:19.806 --> 01:57:26.131
MARISHA: Do we have to with this guy? He fucking--
look at him. He looks shifty.

01:57:26.131 --> 01:57:36.863
MATT: The head turns to you in the hood and you
see dark elvish features. A bald head as the hood

01:57:36.863 --> 01:57:46.607
comes back. What looks to be a female elf of very
lithe form who turns to you and goes, "Actually,

01:57:46.607 --> 01:57:52.137
it is a woman, but I'll ignore that."

01:57:52.137 --> 01:57:58.899
MARISHA: Sorry, you're super covered-- literally
saw no features until right now.

01:57:58.899 --> 01:58:00.695
MATT: "It is fine."

01:58:00.695 --> 01:58:02.570
MARISHA: You're very attractive though.

01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:06.667
(laughter)

01:58:06.667 --> 01:58:10.754
MATT: And she walks ahead of you and the two of
you begin to make your way there. They're guiding

01:58:10.754 --> 01:58:17.438
you towards the Northward and as you step into the
dark following their lead, we're going to take a

01:58:17.438 --> 01:58:18.173
break.

01:58:18.173 --> 01:58:20.292
(cheering)

01:58:20.292 --> 01:58:22.702
MARISHA: I smell bad y'all.

01:58:22.702 --> 01:58:23.594
TRAVIS: Do you?

01:58:23.594 --> 01:58:30.876
MARISHA: Don't. You were like, oh my cape smells
bad and I was like RPing and I like, ooh.

01:58:30.876 --> 01:58:32.595
(laughter)

01:58:32.595 --> 01:58:35.892
TALIESIN: Everybody at home, grab your ticket you
got in the mail. Scratch off number three.

01:58:35.892 --> 01:58:38.348
(laughter)

01:58:38.348 --> 01:58:44.965
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes. For
those of you who want to enter the Wyrmwood

01:58:44.965 --> 01:58:50.418
giveaway, tonight it's a special Valentine's Day
promotion from our friends at Wyrmwood. They have

01:58:50.418 --> 01:58:55.897
four types of dice vaults to choose from where
they translate your Valentine Day's message in

01:58:55.897 --> 01:58:57.055
Elvish.

01:58:57.055 --> 01:58:58.014
(gasping)

01:58:58.014 --> 01:58:59.769
TRAVIS: Damn that shit glows!

01:58:59.769 --> 01:59:01.625
MATT: So you have some golden Evish stuff there.

01:59:01.625 --> 01:59:03.596
LAURA: It's pretty and you can choose the wood.

01:59:03.596 --> 01:59:05.932
LIAM: The writing only shows up if you throw it in
fire.

01:59:05.932 --> 01:59:08.005
(laughter)

01:59:08.005 --> 01:59:16.728
MATT: Don't listen to Liam. To whoever is the
winner of this or any of these, they'll go ahead

01:59:16.728 --> 01:59:20.135
and get you the contact information for Wyrmwood
so they can customize your phrase. If you want to

01:59:20.135 --> 01:59:26.413
be part of this giveaway over the break, make sure
to use the keyword toad. T-O-A-D in the chatroom.

01:59:26.413 --> 01:59:32.772
There's also apparently an anti-Valentine's Day
Drow vault they do as well. It's pretty cool.

01:59:32.772 --> 01:59:37.691
Check them out at wyrmwoodgaming.com but if you
want to enter that, the codeword is toad. Only

01:59:37.691 --> 01:59:41.790
enter once please in the Twitch chat because if
you do more than once, you'll be disqualified.

01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:45.916
Wait for them to notify you over the break and
we'll come back with the winner when we return.

01:59:45.916 --> 01:59:52.325
MARISHA: They gave us an amazing matching set with
the Elvis-- Elvish for our wedding. It was super

01:59:52.325 --> 01:59:57.902
sweet. Thanks Wyrmwood. Elvis from Memphis.

01:59:57.902 --> 02:00:01.235
MATT: (Elvis impression) "Oh that was a natural
20." We'll see you guys in a little bit.

02:00:01.235 --> 02:00:03.618
(cheering)

02:00:03.618 --> 02:06:51.505
[break]

02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:32.292
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. Before we
jump back in, we have our winner from the chat.

02:11:32.292 --> 02:11:43.013
The winner is Piamo_Feddie! If I am reading this
correctly, Piamo_Feddie. Congratulations! Danoba

02:11:43.013 --> 02:11:46.662
will get your contact information, we'll get that
sent out to you. Well done, and happy Valentine's

02:11:46.662 --> 02:11:53.094
Day. Now jumping back into the game, I would like
to ask everyone but Marisha to leave the table,

02:11:53.094 --> 02:11:55.066
please.

02:11:55.066 --> 02:11:57.673
MARISHA: See you, guys.

02:12:01.243 --> 02:12:03.110
TRAVIS: Don't die!

02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:11.231
MARISHA: This is so scary! So nerve wracking.

02:12:16.066 --> 02:12:17.215
MATT: Beauregard.

02:12:17.215 --> 02:12:18.812
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:12:18.812 --> 02:12:28.209
MATT: Quietly, they walk you through the night
air, through the Northward, to a familiar place:

02:12:28.209 --> 02:12:34.996
the outskirts of the Baumbauch Family Brewery.
There's a slight opening on the side warehouse

02:12:34.996 --> 02:12:41.603
doors where you had previously worked when you
first arrived at Trostenwald, and Archivist

02:12:41.603 --> 02:12:47.689
Zeenoth gestures for you to enter. "Please. If you
don't mind, my dear."

02:12:47.689 --> 02:12:54.923
MARISHA: Really? Is this what got me caught,
working for these fucking assholes? Ugh. I walk in.

02:12:55.767 --> 02:13:02.139
MATT: There is a single glowing lantern that is
currently hanging from a rope that is strewn

02:13:02.139 --> 02:13:08.338
across the ceiling of the warehouse that gives a
central source of light to the room. It causes the

02:13:08.338 --> 02:13:12.891
shadows to stretch out very long across the
sides.

02:13:12.891 --> 02:13:14.755
MARISHA: What is this?

02:13:14.755 --> 02:13:24.813
MATT: As you walk in and turn around, the door is
closed. The two figures approach. The female elf

02:13:24.813 --> 02:13:31.815
goes and takes a chair and sets it in the center
beneath the lantern. "Please, have a seat."

02:13:31.815 --> 02:13:35.658
MARISHA: I'd prefer to stand.

02:13:35.658 --> 02:13:39.664
MATT: She just sits back, about 20 or so feet, and
leans against one of the large stacks of crates as

02:13:39.664 --> 02:13:52.822
Zeenoth approaches you. "Now, Beauregard. You have
been what the Archive would call a problematic

02:13:52.822 --> 02:13:53.972
student."

02:13:53.972 --> 02:13:59.900
MARISHA: (laughter)

02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:03.860
MATT: "I've had to pull in quite a bit of a
favor--"

02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:13.083
MARISHA: Sorry. (laughter) Keep going. I'm
listening.

02:14:13.083 --> 02:14:20.419
MATT: "Since I have been assigned to your
tutelage, overseeing your progress and training,

02:14:20.419 --> 02:14:29.830
you've shown great promise, in many ways. You're a
seeker of truth, and you have a keen sense for

02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:32.849
manipulations and falsehoods. Correct?"

02:14:32.849 --> 02:14:35.193
MARISHA: Thanks?

02:14:36.453 --> 02:14:42.104
MATT: "When the Archive took you in at the behest
of your family, you agreed to undergo our

02:14:42.156 --> 02:14:45.282
discipline. Our lifestyle."

02:14:45.282 --> 02:14:51.621
MARISHA: No, I didn't agree to shit. You took me
in because I'm assuming my father paid you a

02:14:51.621 --> 02:14:59.725
pretty nice sum of coin to make sure that you took
me in. I'm assuming that coin is no longer coming

02:14:59.725 --> 02:15:06.102
to the Reserve, so, why do you care?

02:15:06.102 --> 02:15:18.436
MATT: "Believe it or not, not everyone does what
they do in this world for coin. We see possibility

02:15:18.436 --> 02:15:31.764
in you. We, wish to prevent you from blowing out
your own flame. Your tendencies clash with our

02:15:32.062 --> 02:15:34.576
teachings, your dislike for authority."

02:15:34.576 --> 02:15:39.067
MARISHA: Yeah, I thought you guys hated me.
Thought I was doing you a favor by leaving.

02:15:39.067 --> 02:15:44.900
MATT: At which point, the woman from behind says,
"Your dislike for authority is not a bad thing. It

02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:52.037
can keep you alive. Authority should always be
questioned. Those with more power than you should

02:15:52.037 --> 02:15:55.093
be held to a higher standard."

02:15:55.093 --> 02:16:03.107
MARISHA: Thank you, authoritative figure who I am
unaware of your name?

02:16:03.674 --> 02:16:10.796
MATT: At which point, Zeenoth picks up, again,
says, "But the way of the Knowing Mistress has an

02:16:10.796 --> 02:16:18.805
order of learning. Your patience is essential to
adhering to this path. I know it may not be

02:16:18.805 --> 02:16:26.860
stimulating at times, but we must prepare your
mind if we are ever to prepare your soul."

02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:34.449
MARISHA: Yeah, I'd say that sorting books and
punching brick walls repeatedly can definitely not

02:16:34.449 --> 02:16:37.455
be stimulating at all times.

02:16:37.455 --> 02:16:51.236
MATT: "Look, I just wish to--" At which point, the
elven woman goes, "Enough. I've heard enough,

02:16:51.236 --> 02:17:01.291
Zeenoth. You are removed of your responsibility to
oversee Beauregard." Zeenoth's eyes go wide. "This

02:17:01.291 --> 02:17:09.917
is not a student you can help. Return to Zadash."
Zeenoth goes, "Expositor, I do not think that I

02:17:09.917 --> 02:17:18.900
have been given a fair shot. Please--" "I know
this girl, because I see much of myself in her.

02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:33.664
You cannot reach her. Go." Zeenoth looks hurt. "I
apologize that I failed you." He turns around and

02:17:33.664 --> 02:17:40.367
heads back towards the warehouse doors, which
shift open, and close.

02:17:40.367 --> 02:17:43.013
MARISHA: The fuck was that?

02:17:43.013 --> 02:17:47.378
MATT: The woman now steps forward.

02:17:47.378 --> 02:17:53.908
MARISHA: I feel like he made me look like an
asshole, feel like an asshole. Fuck, maybe I'm an

02:17:53.908 --> 02:17:55.178
asshole.

02:17:55.178 --> 02:18:04.567
MATT: "Maybe you're an asshole. You probably are
an asshole. That's all right, because so am I.

02:18:04.567 --> 02:18:10.042
Because sometimes you need someone to be an
asshole to get shit done."

02:18:10.042 --> 02:18:19.230
MARISHA: Being nice never did. What are we
talking, stranger?

02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:26.122
MATT: "I am Expositor Dairon, of the Cobalt
Soul."

02:18:26.122 --> 02:18:27.809
MARISHA: Dairon?

02:18:27.809 --> 02:18:36.148
MATT: D-A-I-R-O-N. "I take it you have heard of
our station through whispers."

02:18:36.148 --> 02:18:44.173
MARISHA: Some people like to call you boogie men.
I figured it was always real. In my opinion, the

02:18:44.173 --> 02:18:49.865
best way to hide in a secret organization is by
having a boogie man.

02:18:49.865 --> 02:18:55.184
MATT: "We are the hidden strength of the library,
you are not wrong. We wade in the filth of

02:18:55.184 --> 02:19:03.740
society. We weed out the corrupt. We pursue the
secret evils of the world, and expose them to the

02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:05.603
light."

02:19:05.603 --> 02:19:06.955
MARISHA: Wow.

02:19:06.955 --> 02:19:15.014
MATT: "We twist the arm of the unjust, until they
spill their mysteries. We are the spies. We are

02:19:15.014 --> 02:19:25.176
the hunters. We are the watchmen to those who
rule. We are not kind. We are forthright. We are

02:19:25.176 --> 02:19:32.626
truth. Do you, Beauregard, want to see the truths
of the world?"

02:19:32.626 --> 02:19:42.932
MARISHA: Oh god, I'm sorry. I have this burn in my
butt from all the smoke you just blew up my ass.

02:19:42.932 --> 02:19:46.883
It's just, oh god. Is that a magical talent?

02:19:46.883 --> 02:19:49.661
MATT: What's your armor class?

02:19:49.997 --> 02:19:52.217
MARISHA: 17.

02:19:58.567 --> 02:20:06.252
MATT: You suffer ten points of bludgeoning damage
as, out of nowhere, her fist hits you right across

02:20:06.504 --> 02:20:08.866
the side of your face.

02:20:08.866 --> 02:20:12.276
MARISHA: It takes me to the ground. That takes me
to the ground.

02:20:12.276 --> 02:20:14.008
MATT: You're unconscious?

02:20:14.008 --> 02:20:17.549
MARISHA: No, just takes me to the ground.

02:20:17.549 --> 02:20:21.718
MATT: Okay. "Are you listening now?"

02:20:21.718 --> 02:20:25.088
MARISHA: Do I have a choice?

02:20:25.088 --> 02:20:28.706
MATT: "Let me be your teacher."

02:20:30.254 --> 02:20:34.601
MARISHA: Oh, boy. Is that what I have to look
forward to?

02:20:35.867 --> 02:20:40.453
MATT: "No. What do you want to do now, that that's
happened?"

02:20:40.453 --> 02:20:42.867
MARISHA: I kind of want to fucking punch you
back.

02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:44.152
MATT: "Then do it."

02:20:52.842 --> 02:20:54.679
"What's stopping you?"

02:20:57.507 --> 02:21:02.120
MARISHA: Now you have my attention. And I fucking
punch her in the face!

02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:04.293
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

02:21:05.950 --> 02:21:07.427
MARISHA: Just a straight unarmed, right?

02:21:07.427 --> 02:21:08.803
MATT: Yep.

02:21:11.054 --> 02:21:14.838
MARISHA: 12 total, not good.

02:21:14.838 --> 02:21:19.768
MATT: She dodges out of the way, and as you move
past, plucks you in the back of the head with a

02:21:19.768 --> 02:21:25.872
knuckle. That hits. You take one point of
bludgeoning damage. It's a very light tap.

02:21:25.872 --> 02:21:31.093
MARISHA: Ow! What the fuck, my dad used to do that
type of shit.

02:21:31.093 --> 02:21:36.768
MATT: With that, she rushes around with a rapid
pace to the front of you, feints with an upper

02:21:36.768 --> 02:21:42.246
cut, and then goes to elbow you in the side of the
head. That is a 16. What's your armor class?

02:21:42.246 --> 02:21:44.593
MARISHA: That misses. 17.

02:21:44.593 --> 02:21:49.339
MATT: Misses. You manage to duck out of the way of
it. She goes, "Good. Good."

02:21:49.655 --> 02:21:52.217
MARISHA: I got to add some points here.

02:21:52.217 --> 02:21:59.667
MATT: Okay. She's going to go ahead and use her
bonus action to go into a defensive stance.

02:22:05.138 --> 02:22:06.503
"Come on."

02:22:07.587 --> 02:22:14.892
MARISHA: (yells) I'm going to spend a ki point,
and go into Flurry of Blows, and do a blind

02:22:14.892 --> 02:22:22.736
haymaker, a second blind haymaker, and then try
and backhand with the third. Wildly, recklessly.

02:22:22.736 --> 02:22:27.164
Okay, first one. Natural 20!

02:22:27.164 --> 02:22:29.133
MATT: Oh, shit!

02:22:29.133 --> 02:22:33.174
MARISHA: Second one. Natural 20!

02:22:33.174 --> 02:22:35.110
MATT: Two natural 20s in a row!

02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:38.218
MARISHA: I don't have anyone sitting next to me to
confirm this, but I swear it's a natural 20!

02:22:38.218 --> 02:22:40.142
MATT: No, I can see it!

02:22:40.142 --> 02:22:44.987
MARISHA: I'll take a picture if I have to! A
natural 17.

02:22:44.987 --> 02:22:47.256
MATT: Roll damage on those first two!

02:22:47.256 --> 02:22:49.398
MARISHA: Okay. You double the dice, right?

02:22:49.398 --> 02:22:51.371
MATT: Yeah. Roll the dice, double it.

02:22:51.371 --> 02:22:57.249
MARISHA: Okay. That was a three, a two, so five,
ten plus eight. 18.

02:22:57.249 --> 02:23:03.068
MATT: 18 points of damage. Then the third strike
that hit?

02:23:03.370 --> 02:23:08.919
MARISHA: One, so another five points. God
fucking-- Thinking of my dad, after she just went

02:23:08.919 --> 02:23:12.640
"boop," something just popping the back of my
head.

02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:20.015
MATT: You watch as her defensive stance, she's
prepared for it, and as you go to swing, she lets

02:23:20.015 --> 02:23:26.048
it down at the last second, and lets you get some
hits in. Wham, wham! But much stronger than she

02:23:26.048 --> 02:23:31.923
expected. The first one clocks her across the
chin. The other one hits her across the temple.

02:23:31.923 --> 02:23:32.860
The last one--

02:23:32.860 --> 02:23:34.478
MARISHA: Just a wild backhand.

02:23:34.478 --> 02:23:38.172
MATT: Just hits her in the back of the head. She
stumbles for a second, then spins around. You can

02:23:38.172 --> 02:23:41.424
see a bit of blood trickling out of the corner of
her mouth, and there's a little bit of a scrape of

02:23:41.424 --> 02:23:49.742
dirt on the side her head where you hit. She turns
around. "Very good. You have learned some things

02:23:49.742 --> 02:24:03.459
in your time." She quickly advances on you. Hits.
18, hits. Okay. You take three points of

02:24:03.459 --> 02:24:09.549
bludgeoning damage, one per hit. Pop! Pop pop! She
is basically going full in with the strike, and is

02:24:09.549 --> 02:24:16.047
just prodding you with these gentle little hits,
showing control, showing that she's entirely able

02:24:16.047 --> 02:24:22.128
to overwhelm you, and she's hitting different
places on your body, strategically. Because with

02:24:22.128 --> 02:24:26.080
each hit, you feel this burst of numbness in those
vicinities. I need you to make a constitution

02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:27.910
saving throw.

02:24:31.258 --> 02:24:36.022
MARISHA: Not great. That's a natural seven, so ten
total.

02:24:36.022 --> 02:24:43.031
MATT: Okay. After each hit, you gather yourself
for a second, she stops and goes, "You are quick,

02:24:43.031 --> 02:24:55.336
and there is intelligence lying in there. You are
also quite nimble at dodging blows. Do you see,

02:24:55.336 --> 02:25:02.463
with but a few simple strikes, I'm able to extract
from you everything I need to know about you."

02:25:02.463 --> 02:25:07.740
MARISHA: What the fuck, why can't I feel my hand?
What did you do?

02:25:07.740 --> 02:25:16.597
MATT: "You see, brute force has its place. But
precision, and intent. That can take down the

02:25:16.597 --> 02:25:24.094
greatest of mountains, by poking the weakest
point. Now, I know where your weak points are."

02:25:25.052 --> 02:25:28.684
MARISHA: You don't know shit about me, bitch. I'm
going to take another attack.

02:25:28.684 --> 02:25:30.692
MATT: Go for it.

02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:36.850
MARISHA: That's a three. That's a nine.

02:25:36.850 --> 02:25:44.214
MATT: Nope. With each miss, or, the first miss,
she's going to use a reaction to attack you.

02:25:44.214 --> 02:25:51.686
That's going to be-- She can do that. Ducks out of
the way, and immediately uses a reaction to smack

02:25:51.686 --> 02:25:56.108
you in the head for one point of damage, another
bludgeoning point. She's going to spend another ki

02:25:56.108 --> 02:26:00.051
point to do another reaction. She can also do
that.

02:26:00.051 --> 02:26:05.644
MARISHA: Roll. I rolled a 15 to attack. Second
attack. These are two attacks, right?

02:26:05.644 --> 02:26:07.104
MATT: For your second one, yeah.

02:26:07.104 --> 02:26:09.046
MARISHA: 15, so, 21.

02:26:09.046 --> 02:26:13.094
MATT: Yeah, the second one does hit. She does not
get the second attack. Roll damage on that second

02:26:13.094 --> 02:26:14.638
strike.

02:26:14.638 --> 02:26:20.072
MARISHA: Okay. Attacking her with the first one,
and then I'm just going to duck down a little and

02:26:20.072 --> 02:26:22.041
jab her right in the ribs.

02:26:22.041 --> 02:26:24.646
MATT: All right. What was the damage on that?

02:26:24.646 --> 02:26:27.657
MARISHA: Eight.

02:26:27.657 --> 02:26:32.313
MATT: Eight damage, nice. You crack her in the
ribs, and the impact actually does catch her off

02:26:32.313 --> 02:26:36.604
guard. She ends up tumbling five feet backward
across the ground, catching herself in a

02:26:36.604 --> 02:26:39.064
three-point landing.

02:26:39.064 --> 02:26:45.660
MARISHA: I back up. I'm going to spend another ki
point to do my defensive stance. Patient defense.

02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:49.622
MATT: Okay. Patient defense. You go into that
stance that she was in earlier, but holding it for

02:26:49.622 --> 02:26:53.461
the entirety of this. Her eyes narrow for a
second. You see her looking at all the different

02:26:53.461 --> 02:26:58.264
points that she struck on you earlier, like she's
reading some sort of a docket on what your

02:26:58.264 --> 02:27:03.622
physicality is. With that, she doesn't run at you,
she runs around you in a circle and begins to jump

02:27:03.622 --> 02:27:08.727
off the sides of the boxes, some of the crates
that are stacked up nearby. You watch them wiggle

02:27:08.727 --> 02:27:11.958
as she puts her weight up against them, leaps
off--

02:27:11.958 --> 02:27:16.219
MARISHA: Instead of getting distracted by her, I
just listen to her and look at her out of my

02:27:16.219 --> 02:27:17.678
periphery.

02:27:17.678 --> 02:27:21.981
MATT: Okay. Eventually, she uses her momentum to
climb to the top with her feet and leap off, then

02:27:21.981 --> 02:27:24.856
come downward with the knee towards you.

02:27:24.856 --> 02:27:29.256
MARISHA: Right as she comes down and I'm going to
use-- Oh, wait, dodge? Go first?

02:27:29.256 --> 02:27:33.129
MATT: You're already in your defensive stance, so
her attack's at disadvantage against you. The

02:27:33.129 --> 02:27:39.120
first strike. 19, 20 to hit?

02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:44.098
MARISHA: Miss. It says patient defense, spend one
ki point to take the dodge action as a bonus

02:27:44.098 --> 02:27:45.895
action on my turn.

02:27:45.895 --> 02:27:48.640
MATT: Correct, what the dodge action does is it
means any attacks against you have disadvantage.

02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:49.946
MARISHA: Oh. Cool.

02:27:49.946 --> 02:27:56.342
MATT: The first one did hit. Second one does not.
The third one does. Two hits still get you. Both

02:27:56.342 --> 02:28:03.669
one point of bludgeoning damage. The knee comes
down, and right as it cracks into your head, she

02:28:03.669 --> 02:28:08.614
shifts to the side and glides off, and as soon as
her body glides off, her back is to yours, and her

02:28:08.614 --> 02:28:14.277
spinning elbow goes and cracks you in the side of
the head, but it stops short, just barely hitting

02:28:14.277 --> 02:28:16.858
you. She's toying with you at this point.

02:28:16.858 --> 02:28:18.626
MARISHA: You said two more points?

02:28:18.626 --> 02:28:21.911
MATT: Yes, two more points of bludgeoning damage.
Make another constitution saving throw, please.

02:28:26.061 --> 02:28:28.509
MARISHA: 11. No, sorry, 12.

02:28:28.895 --> 02:28:34.084
MATT: This time, opposed to the pressure points
being hit, there is the one smack on the side of

02:28:34.084 --> 02:28:35.167
your head.

02:28:35.167 --> 02:28:36.840
MARISHA: Yeah?

02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:41.344
MATT: This pain surges through the side of your
temple, and travels through your spine, to all the

02:28:41.344 --> 02:28:46.719
points she had hit earlier, and your whole body
tenses and seizes for a second. Your vision blurs,

02:28:46.719 --> 02:28:53.728
and your mouth stammers, and you're stunned for
the next round. As she lands behind you, and walks

02:28:53.728 --> 02:29:05.471
around to the front of you, you're unable to, you
can't move, you can't speak. "I can start you on

02:29:05.471 --> 02:29:16.411
this path. You can return to your wanderlust, your
allies. Our kind learns more in the world than in

02:29:16.411 --> 02:29:25.852
a library. Agree to my instruction, to use the
skills I teach you, as you return throughout your

02:29:25.852 --> 02:29:35.946
journeys. One day, you too, can become an
expositor." You begin to regain control of your

02:29:35.946 --> 02:29:39.791
senses, and your speech begins to slowly return to
you.

02:29:44.273 --> 02:29:55.738
MARISHA: Okay. I got to hand it to you, that was
awesome, and I want to know how to do that. You

02:29:55.738 --> 02:29:57.161
beat me.

02:29:57.161 --> 02:30:02.001
MATT: "Very well. Your first lesson begins now."

02:30:03.165 --> 02:30:06.161
MARISHA: Okay. (groan)

02:30:06.161 --> 02:30:17.096
MATT: She snaps her fingers, and you watch as
Zeenoth steps back in, sheepishly. "Is it over, my

02:30:17.096 --> 02:30:27.784
dear? Is it done?" "I need you to stand here for a
second, Zeenoth. I need a body. Let me show you

02:30:27.784 --> 02:30:34.622
the proper pressure points." Zeenoth's eyes go
wide for a second. "I don't believe--" "You owe me

02:30:34.622 --> 02:30:46.804
a favor. I found her for you, did I not?" Zeenoth
sighs, sags his head, and takes his cloak off.

02:30:46.804 --> 02:30:54.189
MARISHA: I grab that stool, and I drag it over.

02:30:54.189 --> 02:31:01.675
MATT: "Now, depending on what you wish to learn,
there are different places where you can pull the

02:31:01.675 --> 02:31:12.158
information from the body." Over the next few
hours, working with you, and over time--

02:31:12.158 --> 02:31:13.843
MARISHA: Does she beat the shit out of Zeenoth?

02:31:13.843 --> 02:31:15.578
MATT: You both do.

02:31:16.269 --> 02:31:22.201
MARISHA: Sorry, Zeenoth. Sorry. God, we're such
assholes.

02:31:22.201 --> 02:31:25.648
MATT: "Assholes that the world needs, from time to
time."

02:31:25.648 --> 02:31:32.695
MARISHA: Yeah. The world does need an asshole.
We'll work on that one together. We'll work on

02:31:32.695 --> 02:31:36.108
that. That's good, that's good.

02:31:36.108 --> 02:31:40.491
MATT: "I'll return to Zadash in the morning. Take
what I have taught you. "When you feel it's time

02:31:40.491 --> 02:31:46.048
for more tutelage, return to me. Do not worry. I
have an eye on you."

02:31:46.048 --> 02:31:49.827
MARISHA: What do I do until then, do I just
continue--

02:31:49.827 --> 02:31:55.287
MATT: "Do what you must. Travel the world. Use
what I've taught you. Learn about injustice. Those

02:31:55.287 --> 02:32:03.287
you don't trust, follow them. Bend them. Make them
tell the truth and admit their guilt. Find where

02:32:03.287 --> 02:32:10.921
ever corruption is. Root it out and let the system
do its job. If the system isn't doing its job,

02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:13.971
destroy the system."

02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:19.138
MARISHA: Why are you doing this? Why me?

02:32:19.138 --> 02:32:25.104
MATT: "Because a long time ago, I was a wayward
girl with no direction, was angry, and fighting at

02:32:25.104 --> 02:32:30.695
the world. And someone did this for me."

02:32:30.695 --> 02:32:38.969
MARISHA: I don't really believe in systems or
being a part of them, let alone a system that

02:32:38.969 --> 02:32:44.803
takes down other systems. Seems almost
hypocritical.

02:32:44.803 --> 02:32:54.557
MATT: "Perhaps. Who knows. Maybe one day you'll
find the corruption inside our own."

02:32:57.262 --> 02:32:59.312
MARISHA: Touche.

02:32:59.312 --> 02:33:04.962
MATT: "Go. Get some rest. Clean up a bit, I think
you could use it."

02:33:04.962 --> 02:33:06.790
MARISHA: You might have broke my wrist.

02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:15.035
MATT: "It'll heal. Zeenoth." She slaps him awake.
His unconscious body on the ground.

02:33:15.650 --> 02:33:18.617
MARISHA: Bye, Zeenoth! Zeenoth!

02:33:18.617 --> 02:33:20.369
MATT: (coughing)

02:33:20.369 --> 02:33:22.232
MARISHA: Zeenoth!

02:33:22.232 --> 02:33:24.475
MATT: "Oh dear."

02:33:24.475 --> 02:33:26.809
MARISHA: Bye.

02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:32.534
MATT: "Goodbye. I have such great pleasure in
saying goodbye, and good riddance."

02:33:32.534 --> 02:33:35.537
MARISHA: I leave.

02:33:35.537 --> 02:33:42.820
MATT: You make your way back to the tavern, go
back into the room, and, exhaustedly, pass out.

02:33:45.051 --> 02:33:47.490
Let's bring everyone else back in.

02:34:01.059 --> 02:34:04.076
MARISHA: Hi, friends. How's it going?

02:34:04.864 --> 02:34:06.634
TRAVIS: Are you alive?

02:34:06.634 --> 02:34:09.880
LIAM: I'm sure everything went according to plan.

02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:12.258
TALIESIN: Quiet dignity and grace.

02:34:12.258 --> 02:34:18.977
MATT: As you all come to consciousness in the
morning, little sore, but recovered--mostly--from

02:34:18.977 --> 02:34:28.439
the battle that wrecked you the evening before.
The fresh smells of cooked meats, and the sounds

02:34:28.439 --> 02:34:37.716
of various patrons below in the inn tavern floor,
rouse you to the morning. What do you wish to do?

02:34:37.716 --> 02:34:41.456
LIAM: Ah--

02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:47.397
MARISHA: Hi, guys. Sorry I snuck in last night.

02:34:47.397 --> 02:34:49.709
TRAVIS: How does she look?

02:34:49.709 --> 02:34:51.125
MATT: She's beat to shit.

02:34:51.125 --> 02:34:55.603
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck! Did you get horse kicked?

02:34:57.565 --> 02:34:59.517
MARISHA: Several times.

02:34:59.517 --> 02:35:01.953
TRAVIS: Damn. How's the horse look?

02:35:01.953 --> 02:35:05.258
MARISHA: Horse is fucking dead. I ate it.

02:35:05.258 --> 02:35:08.583
TRAVIS: That's a bit excessive.

02:35:08.583 --> 02:35:15.660
MARISHA: Horse is fucking fine. Hey, Jester, do
you have a bandage? Do you have a thing?

02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:23.893
LAURA: Oh, yes! Of course I do. I have a lot of
bandages because I am the cleric.

02:35:23.893 --> 02:35:26.924
TRAVIS: I don't know if that bone's supposed to be
sticking out of that part.

02:35:26.924 --> 02:35:33.941
LAURA: Yes, I'm going to open the medical kit and
rummage around. Pull out some stuff. Give me your

02:35:33.941 --> 02:35:36.708
wrist! I can definitely heal this.

02:35:36.708 --> 02:35:38.744
TRAVIS: I bet Yasha can pop it back into place.

02:35:38.744 --> 02:35:40.957
MARISHA: Yeah, &lt;i&gt;crack&lt;/i&gt;.

02:35:40.957 --> 02:35:44.042
MATT: Make a medicine check.

02:35:44.042 --> 02:35:45.768
TRAVIS: You just made a bow.

02:35:45.768 --> 02:35:47.952
TALIESIN: It was string and mime.

02:35:47.952 --> 02:35:49.773
MARISHA: Oh, you made it worse!

02:35:49.773 --> 02:35:51.438
LIAM: (blood gushing)

02:35:51.438 --> 02:35:52.903
LAURA: 20.

02:35:52.903 --> 02:35:55.379
MATT: Okay. It's actually fairly well made; it
gives some nice support to it. I mean, it's more

02:35:55.379 --> 02:36:00.617
of a sprain than a break. But it helps offer some
support to it. It'll heal.

02:36:00.617 --> 02:36:02.499
MARISHA: I've had some sprains that feel like
breaks.

02:36:02.499 --> 02:36:06.107
MATT: Yeah, no, it hurts like a bitch, or it did
last night. Or it feels a little better today, but

02:36:06.107 --> 02:36:08.897
that's definitely going to help give it some
support. Good job.

02:36:08.897 --> 02:36:10.588
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:36:10.588 --> 02:36:11.650
ASHLEY: What happened to you?

02:36:11.650 --> 02:36:12.959
LAURA: I've been practicing.

02:36:12.959 --> 02:36:15.828
TRAVIS: Not you, her. What happened to &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;?

02:36:15.828 --> 02:36:18.841
LAURA: Oh. Sorry.

02:36:18.841 --> 02:36:27.717
MARISHA: Man, it was a great night. I had a great
night! I haven't had a great night in a long time,

02:36:27.717 --> 02:36:29.994
you guys. That was a great night.

02:36:29.994 --> 02:36:31.394
TRAVIS: With the guy you--

02:36:31.394 --> 02:36:33.128
LAURA: You came in really late.

02:36:33.128 --> 02:36:35.174
TALIESIN: I'd like to see the other guy.

02:36:35.174 --> 02:36:41.291
MARISHA: I might have been accepted into, like, a
secret society. It's kind of secret society

02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:43.844
business. It's hard to talk about.

02:36:43.844 --> 02:36:47.770
LAURA: Are you allowed to talk about it? Tell us
about it!

02:36:47.770 --> 02:37:02.064
MARISHA: Okay! No, I can't. It's fine. There are
these monks. I thought they hated me. It turns out

02:37:02.064 --> 02:37:07.528
they like me. Turns out they want me to become a
part of their gang. But it's not really real, and

02:37:07.528 --> 02:37:13.611
they're like, "Just keep doing your thing! But
you're against injustice and seek out truth and

02:37:13.611 --> 02:37:15.477
break systems!"

02:37:15.477 --> 02:37:17.032
LAURA: You are a hero!

02:37:17.032 --> 02:37:20.854
LIAM: Is this one of those dreams where nobody has
their clothes on?

02:37:20.854 --> 02:37:24.020
TALIESIN: You know, if the monks beat you up to
make them join your gang, they're not really your

02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:26.284
friends.

02:37:26.284 --> 02:37:35.063
MARISHA: You know, I said something like that to
her. It wasn't as black and white as that.

02:37:35.063 --> 02:37:38.625
TALIESIN: Is that why they did that to your face
there? Oh, no, they didn't. Apparently they were

02:37:38.625 --> 02:37:39.707
pretty--

02:37:39.707 --> 02:37:45.118
MARISHA: I wouldn't say this woman was my friend.
I would say she's definitely a badass. I wouldn't

02:37:45.118 --> 02:37:47.400
say she's my friend.

02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:50.328
TRAVIS: This woman, was she with the fellow that
you left with last night?

02:37:50.328 --> 02:37:54.798
MARISHA: She was. His name was Zeenoth. He's an
archivist of the Cobalt Reserve. Lot of books

02:37:54.798 --> 02:37:56.249
there. Lot of books.

02:37:56.249 --> 02:37:58.012
TRAVIS: Cobalt Reserve. He was in the court.

02:37:58.012 --> 02:38:00.859
ASHLEY: Was this a test of some sort?

02:38:00.859 --> 02:38:03.500
MARISHA: I think so.

02:38:03.500 --> 02:38:08.644
LAURA: Did you pass? I mean, they made you a hero,
so obviously you did.

02:38:08.644 --> 02:38:16.242
MARISHA: I'm not a hero. That's not what they did.
It's more like a vigilante! Like what we said!

02:38:16.242 --> 02:38:18.293
Yeah!

02:38:18.293 --> 02:38:24.236
LAURA: This is so great. Can they let us into the
secret society too?

02:38:24.236 --> 02:38:26.396
MARISHA: No.

02:38:26.773 --> 02:38:31.872
LIAM: Well, you know, this is very fascinating,
but I have some errands to run. Nott, would you

02:38:31.872 --> 02:38:38.333
like to run errands with me? We are totally coming
back and not leaving on our own undercover.

02:38:38.333 --> 02:38:41.909
TRAVIS, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Insight check.

02:38:42.391 --> 02:38:44.615
LIAM: Bring it on.

02:38:44.615 --> 02:38:47.888
MARISHA: Do you need an insight check to know that
that was shady as fuck?

02:38:47.888 --> 02:38:49.075
TALIESIN: Fuck all.

02:38:49.075 --> 02:38:50.121
LAURA: 15.

02:38:50.121 --> 02:38:52.065
TRAVIS: 11.

02:38:52.065 --> 02:38:53.283
LIAM: Persuasion?

02:38:53.283 --> 02:38:54.261
TALIESIN: 11.

02:38:54.261 --> 02:38:56.294
MATT: You don't have to tell me what you're
rolling!

02:38:56.294 --> 02:39:00.848
LIAM: I rolled a natural 20! Whatever. I'm being
very honest! We're not going anywhere. But I do

02:39:00.848 --> 02:39:07.045
have errands to run. So, we're going to leave
soon. Have some breakfast. I grab some bacon from

02:39:07.045 --> 02:39:13.072
Ford/Fjord's plate, and grab Nott and head out the
door.

02:39:13.072 --> 02:39:15.901
TALIESIN: Meet us at the circus.

02:39:15.901 --> 02:39:25.961
LAURA: I'm going to draw in my sketchbook a
drawing of the devil toad head rolling along the

02:39:25.961 --> 02:39:28.970
ground like a bowling ball.

02:39:28.970 --> 02:39:31.794
SAM and TALIESIN: She really did.

02:39:31.794 --> 02:39:39.557
LAURA: Well, kind of. I put the little bowling
ball things on there. And he's going to run into

02:39:39.557 --> 02:39:45.985
all of us, in chains, being knocked down like
pins.

02:39:45.985 --> 02:39:54.336
MATT: Okay. Roll a dexterity check. Why not?

02:39:56.988 --> 02:39:58.616
LAURA: Eight-- No, 15.

02:39:58.616 --> 02:40:03.605
MATT: It's very well done. There's, like, hatch
mark shading.

02:40:03.605 --> 02:40:09.288
LAURA: Well, I did get really good training, so
it's good that I know how to do shading.

02:40:09.643 --> 02:40:13.410
MATT: All right, what are you guys doing? The rest
of you, while they rush off to go about their

02:40:13.410 --> 02:40:14.670
errands.

02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:18.240
TRAVIS: Apparently eating less of my bacon,
motherfucker.

02:40:19.539 --> 02:40:23.446
TALIESIN: I'm going to pack up and head back to
the circus. Start getting things together.

02:40:23.446 --> 02:40:26.559
ASHLEY: Yeah. I think I'll join you.

02:40:26.559 --> 02:40:30.627
MATT: Molly and Yasha are heading back to the
carnival grounds.

02:40:30.627 --> 02:40:33.836
LAURA: I want to go try to buy a map.

02:40:33.836 --> 02:40:34.966
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

02:40:34.966 --> 02:40:36.228
LAURA: Yeah!

02:40:36.228 --> 02:40:38.466
ASHLEY: Oh, I did actually want to see that map.

02:40:38.466 --> 02:40:44.174
TALIESIN: I'll meet you there. Actually, you know
what? I want to see you see that map.

02:40:45.113 --> 02:40:49.664
ASHLEY: I think that's a great idea. Seeing me see
a map is something pretty special.

02:40:49.664 --> 02:40:52.581
TALIESIN: It's gorgeous. It's fabulous.

02:40:52.581 --> 02:40:56.490
MATT: You guys, where are you heading off to?

02:40:56.490 --> 02:41:02.117
LIAM: I have two places to go. The first, we're
going to the Burnished Bibelots. The second is a

02:41:02.117 --> 02:41:07.751
surprise. But I know that I whisked you away in a
hurry the other day and you weren't done

02:41:07.812 --> 02:41:09.664
browsing.

02:41:09.664 --> 02:41:13.980
SAM: That sounds lovely and I would like to browse
there again, but, honestly, Caleb, I am very

02:41:13.980 --> 02:41:22.248
worried about you. You have passed out twice in
the last few days, and unless we get you a healing

02:41:22.248 --> 02:41:29.849
potion, there is no promise that you will still be
alive tomorrow. I think we should go to Natural

02:41:29.849 --> 02:41:35.503
Remedies. You distract the owner while I go in the
back and I steal a healing potion. It's the only

02:41:35.503 --> 02:41:38.386
way to guarantee your safety.

02:41:38.386 --> 02:41:44.518
LIAM: Maybe that's the third place that we go. I
will point out your point, which was that these

02:41:44.518 --> 02:41:49.339
crazy bastards are very distracting and strange,
yeah?

02:41:49.339 --> 02:41:50.887
SAM: Yes!

02:41:50.887 --> 02:41:58.458
LIAM: So they could be my healing potion, you
know? We'll talk about it. Third place. So, drag

02:41:58.458 --> 02:42:02.032
her off to the Burnished Bibelots. Boom, in the
door.

02:42:02.032 --> 02:42:09.775
MATT: You head inside. It looks as chaotic as you
left it. You see what looks to be a small bowl of

02:42:09.775 --> 02:42:17.885
heated porridge that's gathered on the counter,
and cross-legged on top is the fantastic gnomish

02:42:17.885 --> 02:42:24.389
purveyor of the interior, Oglen. "Hello?"

02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:26.592
LIAM: Good day to you, sir!

02:42:26.592 --> 02:42:28.852
MATT: "Good day to you as well."

02:42:28.852 --> 02:42:33.606
LIAM: I give Nott a little shove over towards the
shelves and walk up to him, right up to the

02:42:33.606 --> 02:42:37.712
counter. What are you eating there? That looks
good.

02:42:37.712 --> 02:42:40.606
MATT: "Breakfast."

02:42:40.606 --> 02:42:47.708
LIAM: All right, yeah. That's what that is. You
know, I wanted to thank you for the book. I don't

02:42:47.708 --> 02:42:52.017
know if you read it yourself, but I read it cover
to cover quickly. It was fascinating and very

02:42:52.017 --> 02:42:54.626
useful. 
[aside, quietly] &lt;i&gt;I hope you're doing stuff over there.&lt;/i&gt;

02:42:54.673 --> 02:42:56.864
MATT: "All sales are final!"

02:42:56.864 --> 02:43:05.388
LIAM: Well, here's the thing. I have read this
book and loved it, and if you would like to

02:43:05.388 --> 02:43:13.657
purchase it for the low, low price of one gold,
you can sell it again. You sold it to me for

02:43:13.657 --> 02:43:18.449
three. You have it back for one. You can turn a
profit.

02:43:18.449 --> 02:43:20.660
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:43:22.908 --> 02:43:25.299
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:43:25.712 --> 02:43:28.903
MATT: You watch as some of the porridge is
spilling out the side of his mouth, and he rubs it

02:43:28.903 --> 02:43:39.109
off. "All right." And he pulls a gold coin out of
his pouch.

02:43:42.709 --> 02:43:49.127
LIAM: That is a good decision, and it was a good
book. I am grateful for the knowledge you have

02:43:49.136 --> 02:43:50.601
imparted upon me.

02:43:50.601 --> 02:43:52.398
MATT: "Might I have the book?"

02:43:52.398 --> 02:43:57.432
LIAM: Oh, of course! It's right here on the table.
Sorry, grandfather.

02:43:57.432 --> 02:44:00.028
MATT: "All sales are final."

02:44:00.028 --> 02:44:03.609
LIAM: Right. You will not sell that back to me,
for sure.

02:44:03.609 --> 02:44:09.085
MATT: "Do you want it? I can sell it to you for
three gold."

02:44:09.085 --> 02:44:13.325
LIAM: That's a good price. Nott, how are you
doing?

02:44:13.325 --> 02:44:18.822
SAM: (chewing) Bacon's really good!

02:44:18.822 --> 02:44:20.638
LIAM: All done for the day?

02:44:20.638 --> 02:44:24.041
SAM: I'm looking around for something to swipe.

02:44:24.041 --> 02:44:28.775
MATT: Make an investigation check. You guys keep
just shaking down this poor gnome guy.

02:44:28.775 --> 02:44:29.989
SAM: Ten.

02:44:29.989 --> 02:44:35.944
MATT: Looking around, I mean, a lot of this is
knick-knacks and inane garbage, and things that

02:44:35.944 --> 02:44:46.149
just aren't quite worth what you'd be looking for.
You do find one art piece that looks like it's a

02:44:46.149 --> 02:44:51.098
pretty good art piece with a decent frame, might
be worth a little bit, but that's the best you can

02:44:51.098 --> 02:44:56.309
find. Everything else here looks like it's the
dingy side of the Salvation Army.

02:44:56.309 --> 02:45:04.918
SAM: Anything small? Ooh! Can I find my old flask
that I left here?

02:45:04.918 --> 02:45:08.512
MATT: Yes, I'll let you do that. It has not moved
from where you placed it.

02:45:08.512 --> 02:45:11.272
SAM: I'm going to steal back my old flask.

02:45:11.272 --> 02:45:13.347
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check, please.

02:45:13.347 --> 02:45:18.791
LIAM: What is that little dancer toy? Between the
three red mushrooms on the shelf behind you, is

02:45:18.791 --> 02:45:21.616
that a music box there?

02:45:21.616 --> 02:45:25.989
MATT: "It is a music box." 
He takes it and cranks it.

02:45:26.475 --> 02:45:28.353
SAM: 24.

02:45:28.353 --> 02:45:30.742
MATT: "It was a music box."

02:45:30.742 --> 02:45:32.737
LIAM: It's lost the magic.

02:45:32.737 --> 02:45:34.833
MATT: "I can fix it."

02:45:34.833 --> 02:45:37.245
LIAM: How long would that take?

02:45:37.245 --> 02:45:42.945
MATT: He breaks it open, looks inside. "Three
days."

02:45:42.945 --> 02:45:49.888
LIAM: Okay. Well, I'll come back and see your work
in three days. Work on that and your breakfast.

02:45:49.888 --> 02:45:53.253
Hey Nott, are you ready?

02:45:53.253 --> 02:45:54.839
SAM: Mm-hmm!

02:45:54.839 --> 02:45:57.470
LIAM: All right. Good day to you. Happy sales.

02:45:57.470 --> 02:46:00.032
MATT: "Happy sales, as well."

02:46:00.032 --> 02:46:03.466
LIAM: Sure. Out the door.

02:46:03.466 --> 02:46:06.298
SAM: I rolled a 24.

02:46:06.298 --> 02:46:08.826
MATT: Yeah, he did not notice at all.

02:46:08.826 --> 02:46:14.549
LIAM: I'm going to head in the direction, dragging
my goblin friend with me, to that fancy bathhouse

02:46:14.549 --> 02:46:19.852
that was described to me last night at the Nestled
Nook.

02:46:19.852 --> 02:46:28.959
MATT: You guys make your way southward. Go ahead
and make a general charisma check.

02:46:28.959 --> 02:46:34.356
LIAM: Charisma check? Well, something I wanted to
do before we got there, was going to do it maybe

02:46:34.356 --> 02:46:43.698
in an alley, but you tell me, is I would like to
cast Disguise Self on myself. Presumably gone into

02:46:43.698 --> 02:46:48.486
an alleyway so no one sees me doing this in the
middle of the road. I take the form of a man in

02:46:48.486 --> 02:46:55.978
very fancy green robes, beautiful blond hair, very
handsome man, with a vomit stain down the front of

02:46:55.978 --> 02:46:57.470
my clothes.

02:46:57.470 --> 02:47:01.319
MATT: Okay. Specific and easily done.

02:47:01.319 --> 02:47:09.203
LIAM: I drag my little friend along with me. You
are going to like this, this is something very special.

02:47:09.203 --> 02:47:10.798
SAM: I'm excited.

02:47:10.798 --> 02:47:16.702
LIAM: Oh, charisma check. Straight charisma?

02:47:16.702 --> 02:47:18.375
MATT: Straight charisma. Add your modifier.

02:47:18.375 --> 02:47:20.455
LIAM: Yeah, it's 11.

02:47:20.455 --> 02:47:26.636
MATT: 11, okay. With your Disguise Self form, it's
easy enough for you to ask a few questions, and

02:47:26.636 --> 02:47:35.520
eventually you are given directions to what is
called the Warm Dew Bathhouse. Warm Dew.

02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:37.635
LAURA: Warm Doo, D-O-O.

02:47:37.635 --> 02:47:39.568
MATT: D-E-W.

02:47:39.568 --> 02:47:42.482
LIAM: Dew, dew. There's a liquid u in that.

02:47:42.482 --> 02:47:45.435
TRAVIS: Warm doo. Thank you.

02:47:45.435 --> 02:47:49.154
MATT: It'll be one before you bathe there and the
other when you leave.

02:47:49.154 --> 02:47:52.511
(laughter)

02:47:52.511 --> 02:47:55.339
LIAM: All right, let's enter this establishment.

02:47:55.339 --> 02:48:01.847
MATT: For as far south as this is, it's pretty
decent compared to the other areas. Most of the

02:48:01.847 --> 02:48:06.900
Hillsward-- you get the sense that a lot of the
rural farming community that fills out most of

02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:13.207
Trostenwald, a lot of the money that gets made
goes directly to the central portion of this ward,

02:48:13.207 --> 02:48:17.723
where this bathhouse is. It's small, but it's
really well put together. As you walk inside, you

02:48:17.723 --> 02:48:24.813
can see there are marble busts set on the sides of the
entrance way, each side. You can see nice

02:48:24.813 --> 02:48:32.878
tapestries that are pulled back over the windows,
and as both of you walk in, you see this young

02:48:32.878 --> 02:48:45.555
man, maybe his mid-twenties or so. Human, but he
looks very thin and sickly, like he had a rough

02:48:45.555 --> 02:48:51.059
upbringing, and his general constitution has
suffered for it. He has a warm smile, and he's

02:48:51.059 --> 02:48:55.828
wearing these long white robes with what looks to
be a yellowish scarf that's wrapped around as he

02:48:55.828 --> 02:48:59.184
approaches. "Hello and good morning. Can I help
you?"

02:48:59.184 --> 02:49:06.145
LIAM: Yes, one moment. (quietly) Stay close to me
and let me do the talking. (louder) Hello, please,

02:49:06.145 --> 02:49:10.085
don't focus-- my daughter is shy.

02:49:10.085 --> 02:49:12.339
MATT: "I'm very sorry."

02:49:12.339 --> 02:49:19.143
LIAM: I've had a terrible day. Some disgusting
derelict has vomited all over me, I smell like

02:49:19.143 --> 02:49:25.294
filth, and I would like to spend a couple of hours
in your finest bath. Maybe not your finest. A good

02:49:25.294 --> 02:49:34.437
bath, for a couple of hours. My daughter and I. I
will need adjoining baths, if you have that. For

02:49:34.437 --> 02:49:37.175
modesty's sake, my daughter and I.

02:49:37.175 --> 02:49:40.324
MATT: "That can be done. Of course." Make a
persuasion check.

02:49:40.324 --> 02:49:48.228
LIAM: (humming) There's a 12.

02:49:48.228 --> 02:49:57.510
MATT: "For two hours, that will run-- for two
baths adjoining, we'll put it at eight silver pieces."

02:49:57.510 --> 02:50:02.192
LIAM: That's fine. I definitely have that. I take
out the eight silver, I slap it down.

02:50:02.192 --> 02:50:04.790
MATT: "Wonderful. We'll show you to your
bathroom."

02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:08.064
LIAM: Okay. Come along, dear.

02:50:08.064 --> 02:50:10.524
SAM: Yes, Vater.

02:50:10.524 --> 02:50:20.767
MATT: You guys are escorted to what-- It's really
off-putting for the two of you. Not only is the

02:50:20.767 --> 02:50:25.901
smell clean inside here, but there's the scent of
lavender in the hallway, and you hear soft music

02:50:25.901 --> 02:50:32.327
in the distance. As you walk past, you do see that
there is a resident violinist that plays, and you

02:50:32.327 --> 02:50:33.732
guys are led to these two--

02:50:33.732 --> 02:50:35.174
SAM: This is really nice!

02:50:35.174 --> 02:50:36.650
LIAM: Yes, it is.

02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:48.435
SAM: They got a violinist over there! I'm sorry,
zey got a violinist over zere, Vater.

02:50:48.435 --> 02:51:02.212
LIAM: That's meine Liebchen. I'm hoping for a hot
bath for the both of us. It has been a long bit of travel.

02:51:02.212 --> 02:51:07.850
MATT: "Right this way." Leads you into the
chambers. There is a glass, fogged window, so the

02:51:07.850 --> 02:51:14.102
sunlight comes through, but no one can see
through. There are some linens set out, a towel,

02:51:14.102 --> 02:51:20.546
and two basins that are freshly filled with
steaming water. You are left into the chamber.

02:51:20.546 --> 02:51:22.216
LIAM: Are they separate, though?

02:51:22.216 --> 02:51:27.635
MATT: They're separated by a small wall that's eye
length, but you can still talk to each other over it.

02:51:27.635 --> 02:51:33.374
LIAM: Excellent. This is called a bath.

02:51:33.374 --> 02:51:36.428
SAM: I've heard of them.

02:51:36.428 --> 02:51:46.149
LIAM: A hot bath. We have been pretty dinged up
for the past several months, and we might not get

02:51:46.149 --> 02:51:51.138
back into something like this for a while, so I
want you to enjoy it. Go over to your side, and I

02:51:51.138 --> 02:51:56.716
will be here. Nott, I'm going to do a bit of
reading.

02:51:56.716 --> 02:51:59.340
SAM: While you bathe?

02:51:59.340 --> 02:52:00.654
LIAM: Yes.

02:52:00.654 --> 02:52:05.329
SAM: You'll still be the same Caleb when you're
done, right?

02:52:05.329 --> 02:52:07.271
LIAM: Yes, I will be the same Caleb.

02:52:07.271 --> 02:52:09.989
SAM: I've just gotten used to you, and now you're going
to change a bit.

02:52:09.989 --> 02:52:12.941
LIAM: Trust me, I will not.

02:52:12.941 --> 02:52:15.138
SAM: All right.

02:52:15.138 --> 02:52:22.344
LIAM: Once she is clear of the wall, I'm going to
start actually disrobing, although I guess the

02:52:22.344 --> 02:52:23.971
illusion stays.

02:52:23.971 --> 02:52:31.555
MATT: The illusion stays. Strangely, clothes start
apparating out of you. (slurping)

02:52:31.555 --> 02:52:38.244
MARISHA: It's like a bad video game glitch. Bad
texture glitch.

02:52:38.244 --> 02:52:44.559
LIAM: Nott, I'm probably going to go quiet for a
little while.

02:52:44.559 --> 02:52:51.058
SAM: No problem. I'll just be over here, you know,
bathing.

02:52:51.058 --> 02:53:01.906
LIAM: Enjoy it. I find the second book and examine
it. Am I able to read this?

02:53:01.906 --> 02:53:12.240
MATT: You are, actually. There is one incomplete
arcane inscription in there. Unfortunately, it's

02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:18.309
been too burned, beyond recognition. You can see
this was a spellbook. Mostly destroyed, but there

02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:23.913
are two complete spells in there that, if you wish
to, you could transcribe over into your book.

02:53:23.913 --> 02:53:28.448
Those would be Arcane Lock and Unseen Servant.

02:53:28.448 --> 02:53:31.395
ALL: Ooh!

02:53:31.395 --> 02:53:42.989
LIAM: So. All my actual clothes are off. I'm going to
take the book and set it on the edge of the basin.

02:53:42.989 --> 02:53:52.016
MATT: Because you paid for it, there is a hinged,
small desk piece where food can be eaten, or

02:53:52.016 --> 02:53:54.488
drinks could be served while people are taking a
bath.

02:53:54.488 --> 02:54:06.478
LIAM: I set it down. I sit with just my legs in
the bath for a moment, and I look at the book.

02:54:09.615 --> 02:54:10.645
[exhales]

02:54:16.365 --> 02:54:23.522
SAM: I'm going to find the pitcher of cucumber
water, dump it on the floor, and eat all the cucumbers.

02:54:23.522 --> 02:54:28.336
(laughter)

02:54:28.336 --> 02:54:31.113
MATT: As you hear over the wall (gobbling).

02:54:31.113 --> 02:54:34.360
SAM: Look around for anything in the room that can
be stolen?

02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:44.811
MATT: Plenty of things, actually. No one's
watching. There's a vase that's really nice. The

02:54:44.811 --> 02:54:52.008
doorknob itself is a brass, gold-like material.

02:54:52.008 --> 02:54:53.581
SAM: I'll start working on that.

02:54:53.581 --> 02:54:56.087
MATT: Using your thieves' tools, you can get that
free, if you want.

02:54:56.087 --> 02:55:07.855
SAM: After a while, I put a toe into the water,
feel it, and I'm like: Nah. I'll use my empty

02:55:07.855 --> 02:55:10.680
flask and fill it up with water.

02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:12.971
MATT: Okay. You get a water flask.

02:55:12.971 --> 02:55:14.874
SAM: Then work on the doorknob.

02:55:14.874 --> 02:55:20.367
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a thieves' tools
check, adding your dexterity.

02:55:20.367 --> 02:55:22.737
SAM: 12.

02:55:22.737 --> 02:55:24.994
MATT: Add the dexterity and your proficiency.

02:55:24.994 --> 02:55:26.685
SAM: Oh. 14.

02:55:26.685 --> 02:55:35.634
MATT: There you go. With very little sound, the
doorknob comes off, and you have now a solid brass

02:55:35.634 --> 02:55:37.938
doorknob. There is the vase.

02:55:37.938 --> 02:55:41.032
SAM: Is it a big vase?

02:55:41.032 --> 02:55:46.594
MATT: It's like that big. It's more of a
decorative flower holder over by the window.

02:55:46.594 --> 02:55:48.625
SAM: Sure. I'll try to get that too.

02:55:48.625 --> 02:55:52.166
MATT: Easy. You get it. There's nobody watching
you!

02:55:52.166 --> 02:55:55.339
SAM: I'll also save the flowers in a separate
pouch.

02:55:55.339 --> 02:55:57.241
MATT: Okay. There you go.

02:55:57.241 --> 02:56:00.403
SAM: Any towels. Ooh, you know what?

02:56:00.403 --> 02:56:02.029
MATT: Yeah, the linens can be taken.

02:56:02.029 --> 02:56:07.467
SAM: I'm going to take one towel and tear it into
shreds, and use it to replace any of my bandages

02:56:07.467 --> 02:56:09.337
that have worn or fallen off.

02:56:09.337 --> 02:56:10.962
MATT: Easy enough. There's some nice clean
bandages. Good.

02:56:10.962 --> 02:56:12.247
SAM: I'm good.

02:56:12.247 --> 02:56:24.482
LIAM: On my side, while all of that is happening,
two things. One is that when I finally get into

02:56:24.482 --> 02:56:34.104
the tub I dip my whole body almost entirely in,
but not my head or hair. Letting the bruises soak

02:56:34.104 --> 02:56:40.318
in the hot water, which feels wonderful. The
second thing is, while flipping the pages of this

02:56:40.318 --> 02:56:47.775
book, very still, I can hear all of this, and it
is extremely endearing, but I go completely still.

02:56:47.775 --> 02:56:55.390
Completely quiet. And read in peace.

02:56:55.390 --> 02:57:07.517
MATT: While you guys are taking a bath, the rest
of you are going off on a shopping trip. Except

02:57:07.517 --> 02:57:08.572
for you, you're going to--

02:57:08.572 --> 02:57:10.114
TALIESIN: No, I'm going map hunting.

02:57:10.114 --> 02:57:11.902
MATT: That's right. You're going. Who's all going
together?

02:57:11.902 --> 02:57:13.138
LAURA: All of us.

02:57:13.138 --> 02:57:14.674
MATT: Where are you going?

02:57:14.674 --> 02:57:23.314
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to ask Yorda if there's a
map maker in town.

02:57:23.314 --> 02:57:26.398
TALIESIN: Or if she can draw us a map of how to
get there.

02:57:26.398 --> 02:57:31.931
MATT: "There's not much of a specific cartographer
in place. Most of the cartography guilds are up

02:57:31.931 --> 02:57:39.817
"north in either Zadash or Rexxentrum. There might
be one in Alfield? We're a bit small over here.

02:57:39.817 --> 02:57:43.312
"You could ask the general store, or you could
maybe go to the stockade. They have maps there but

02:57:43.312 --> 02:57:45.224
"they use those. You might be able to pay enough
for them."

02:57:45.224 --> 02:57:47.252
LAURA: I don't want to go back to the stockade.

02:57:47.252 --> 02:57:52.399
MATT: "Then maybe check the general store or any
of the strange book places might have something

02:57:52.399 --> 02:57:54.002
"old and lying in the back."

02:57:54.002 --> 02:57:56.329
LAURA: Ooh, what strange book places?

02:57:56.329 --> 02:58:04.427
MATT: "Well, let's see. There's the Hillsbrook
Parchment and Binding. There's the Burnished

02:58:04.427 --> 02:58:10.624
"Bibelots, that I think one of your friends has
already been to. Those are the two strange book

02:58:10.624 --> 02:58:13.687
"places. I'm not much of a reader myself, so I
couldn't tell you."

02:58:13.687 --> 02:58:16.299
LAURA: Can you draw me a map of how to get to
those places?

02:58:16.299 --> 02:58:19.136
MARISHA: We've already been to the general store.

02:58:19.136 --> 02:58:23.414
LAURA: Yes, you're right. I guess we can try that
place.

02:58:23.414 --> 02:58:27.698
MARISHA: You can still make her draw a map. I
don't want to rain on your parade. I'm sorry.

02:58:27.698 --> 02:58:29.323
TRAVIS: You just shit all over her.

02:58:29.323 --> 02:58:30.899
MARISHA: I totally did.

02:58:30.899 --> 02:58:35.918
MATT: She gives you directions.

02:58:35.918 --> 02:58:41.617
LAURA: Let's go on a trip!

02:58:41.617 --> 02:58:43.619
MATT: Where are you guys going first?

02:58:43.619 --> 02:58:45.261
MARISHA: (singing) General store!

02:58:45.261 --> 02:58:47.492
LAURA: We've been there before.

02:58:47.492 --> 02:58:49.958
MARISHA: (singing) I want to buy another health
pack!

02:58:49.958 --> 02:58:51.604
SAM: Health pack?

02:58:51.604 --> 02:58:53.161
MARISHA: I meant a healer's kit.

02:58:53.161 --> 02:58:59.868
LAURA: The general store doesn't like us very
much. Oh wait. That healer's kit, is that the one

02:58:59.868 --> 02:59:01.721
you bought when we were together?

02:59:01.721 --> 02:59:02.737
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:59:02.737 --> 02:59:05.179
LAURA: You spent way too much money on it because
I changed the tag?

02:59:05.179 --> 02:59:08.110
MARISHA: Yeah. That one.

02:59:08.110 --> 02:59:11.666
LAURA: That was great. Now I have it. Cool.

02:59:11.666 --> 02:59:13.408
MARISHA: You won twice.

02:59:13.408 --> 02:59:15.448
MATT: Everything's coming up Jester.

02:59:15.448 --> 02:59:17.952
LAURA: All right, let's go back there. They don't
like me, but let's go back there.

02:59:17.952 --> 02:59:21.640
MARISHA: I can just pop in if you want to wait
outside.

02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:23.140
LAURA: They don't like you either.

02:59:23.140 --> 02:59:25.520
MARISHA, Yeah, but they like money. Let's go.

02:59:25.520 --> 02:59:30.634
MATT: All right, so you guys make your way to
Lochward General in the Lochward District. As you

02:59:30.634 --> 02:59:40.055
enter, the older woman, Harper Mince, is there in
the general store. It's the large, almost wooden

02:59:40.055 --> 02:59:48.349
barn exterior. The front door opens two ways, and
the inside is wall-to-wall lined with tools for

02:59:48.349 --> 02:59:55.358
farming and farming equipment for building.
There's lumber. There's all sorts of iron nails.

02:59:55.358 --> 03:00:01.094
It's by all accounts a rural general store.

03:00:01.094 --> 03:00:08.248
You see on far end is Harper, the older
woman there, standing and looking out at the rest

03:00:08.339 --> 03:00:15.913
of you. "Hi, can I help you? What are you looking
for?"

03:00:15.913 --> 03:00:20.083
LAURA: We are looking for pickles, did you get any
yet?

03:00:20.083 --> 03:00:23.672
MATT: "No, we don't sell pickles here, sorry."

03:00:23.672 --> 03:00:27.418
LAURA: Most general stores have pickles, this is
the only thing.

03:00:27.418 --> 03:00:31.737
MARISHA: You're not wrong, generally, yeah.

03:00:31.737 --> 03:00:34.154
MATT: "We can order some pickles, if you like."

03:00:34.154 --> 03:00:39.638
LAURA: Yeah, you probably should. I think you
would do well if you sold pickles. Do you have

03:00:39.638 --> 03:00:43.675
maps for sale of the area?

03:00:44.112 --> 03:00:49.140
MATT: "The area? Let me check. I'll be right
back."

03:00:49.140 --> 03:00:53.372
LAURA: Does she leave the room?

03:00:53.372 --> 03:00:56.241
MATT: Yeah, she does. She leaves the room.

03:00:56.241 --> 03:00:59.717
TRAVIS: Don't-- put your hands in your pockets.

03:00:59.717 --> 03:01:04.323
LAURA: Don't put my hands in my pockets, got it! I
start running around and just moving everything on

03:01:04.323 --> 03:01:07.036
the shelves again the same way as before.

03:01:07.036 --> 03:01:08.592
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

03:01:08.592 --> 03:01:09.992
SAM: You're just moving things?

03:01:09.992 --> 03:01:11.363
LAURA: Yeah, just like moving--

03:01:11.363 --> 03:01:13.607
TRAVIS: Please be Laura when she was five and
break shit.

03:01:13.607 --> 03:01:16.648
LAURA: Oh yes! 18 plus five.

03:01:19.798 --> 03:01:20.995
TALIESIN: This is beautiful.

03:01:22.101 --> 03:01:31.246
MATT: With nary a squeak you completely rearrange
in a period of about two and a half minutes most

03:01:31.246 --> 03:01:39.187
of the price cards that are dangling from a number
of the tools, their placement. You guys all sit

03:01:39.187 --> 03:01:45.005
back and watch as this glorious display-- you can
almost hear the William Tell Overture begin to

03:01:45.005 --> 03:01:50.537
play in the back of your head as she rummages back
and forth throughout the interior of the chamber,

03:01:50.537 --> 03:01:55.737
turning things around and sticking them in the
ground. It has been completely rearranged.

03:01:55.737 --> 03:01:58.235
LIAM: [old man voice] Why 
is this crowbar seven gold?

03:02:00.634 --> 03:02:06.744
MATT: Eventually you hear some rummaging from the
back room and some footsteps coming nearby and you

03:02:06.744 --> 03:02:12.768
quickly stop and return to your original point
there and Harper Mince returns from the back room.

03:02:12.768 --> 03:02:20.100
She has a few papers in her arms. She goes, "I'm
sorry, we don't have any maps of the local area

03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:27.232
for detail. I have a map of the Dwendalian Empire
as a whole, I hope that's enough."

03:02:27.232 --> 03:02:35.789
LAURA: I mean, that could work, I suppose. It's
not what we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt;, but if that's what you have

03:02:35.789 --> 03:02:39.277
that's what we can buy from you.

03:02:39.277 --> 03:02:46.052
MATT: "All right, let me look at the date here.
This will run about seven silver."

03:02:46.052 --> 03:02:49.912
LAURA: Okay, that sounds like a good price, yeah.

03:02:49.912 --> 03:02:55.970
MARISHA: Can I also get another healer's kit? If
you have one.

03:02:55.970 --> 03:03:02.015
MATT: "Right, yes, let me go ahead and get that
for you here." The healer's kit. Looking up the

03:03:02.015 --> 03:03:08.881
pricing in the equipment section.That is five gold
pieces for the healer's kit.

03:03:08.881 --> 03:03:11.653
(groaning)

03:03:11.653 --> 03:03:13.292
MARISHA: Five gold.

03:03:13.292 --> 03:03:15.906
MATT: All right, mark it off. You get yourself a
secondary healer's kit.

03:03:15.906 --> 03:03:18.484
MARISHA: Well, one healer's kit. She's got the
other one.

03:03:18.484 --> 03:03:20.238
MATT: You hand over the seven silver?

03:03:20.238 --> 03:03:22.101
LAURA: Yes, I do.

03:03:22.101 --> 03:03:25.244
MATT: She takes it and put the ribbon back on it.

03:03:28.291 --> 03:03:32.028
&lt;i&gt;Finally&lt;/i&gt; get to give that to you guys.

03:03:32.028 --> 03:03:34.476
LIAM: Shut the front door!

03:03:34.476 --> 03:03:38.479
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;And&lt;/i&gt; I have a pretty ribbon out of it.

03:03:38.479 --> 03:03:40.463
TALIESIN: We're going to Goonies this really
quickly here. Ready?

03:03:42.253 --> 03:03:45.386
LAURA: What the fuck?!

03:03:45.386 --> 03:03:49.393
SAM: That's beautiful! Who made this? Did you make
this?

03:03:49.393 --> 03:03:56.600
MATT: I designed the layout, but the map is made
by a wonderful woman named Deven Rue, who does

03:03:56.600 --> 03:03:59.553
incredible handcrafted maps.

03:03:59.553 --> 03:04:01.104
SAM: You got to get a camera on this shit.

03:04:01.104 --> 03:04:02.829
TRAVIS: Hold it up!

03:04:02.829 --> 03:04:04.479
MARISHA: Put it in the middle.

03:04:04.479 --> 03:04:06.701
TALIESIN: Take a look, it's amazing!

03:04:06.701 --> 03:04:09.366
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

03:04:09.366 --> 03:04:12.484
MARISHA: Wait, where are we?

03:04:12.484 --> 03:04:17.773
MATT: You guys are in Trostenwald, right there.
This is north, this is south.

03:04:17.773 --> 03:04:19.687
SAM: Angle it to that camera.

03:04:19.687 --> 03:04:21.424
LAURA: What camera?

03:04:21.424 --> 03:04:23.161
ALL: Wow.

03:04:23.161 --> 03:04:29.219
MATT: This is the Dwendalian Empire. This is not
all of Wildemount, this is just a portion. Deven

03:04:29.500 --> 03:04:38.068
did an incredible job with this. You should follow
her on Patreon or Twitter, she does amazing work.

03:04:38.068 --> 03:04:39.448
She does incredible work.

03:04:39.448 --> 03:04:42.611
LAURA: Oh my god, you guys, let's go all of these
places.

03:04:42.611 --> 03:04:45.573
ASHLEY: Maybe not &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of them.

03:04:45.573 --> 03:04:51.420
LAURA: Okay, we are definitely going to visit this
place called Hupperdook.

03:04:51.420 --> 03:04:54.481
SAM: I think I had one of those this morning.

03:04:54.674 --> 03:04:57.572
[laughter]

03:04:57.572 --> 03:05:04.775
LAURA: Then we'll make our way up to Nogvuror. Oh
man, this is awesome. Hey look, look over here!

03:05:04.775 --> 03:05:06.471
This is where I live!

03:05:06.471 --> 03:05:07.894
SAM: There be dragons there.

03:05:07.894 --> 03:05:09.305
TALIESIN: You live in a serpent?

03:05:09.305 --> 03:05:10.426
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

03:05:10.426 --> 03:05:12.993
MATT: By the way, Deven, who did the map, it is
her birthday today.

03:05:13.213 --> 03:05:16.454
MARISHA: Happy birthday, Deven!

03:05:16.454 --> 03:05:22.052
LAURA: Damn, this is amazing! Okay, I'll leave it
up here.

03:05:22.052 --> 03:05:28.504
TALIESIN: If you pull out a real medi-kit now I'm
going to be really excited. 50 bandages come

03:05:28.504 --> 03:05:29.716
flying in...

03:05:29.716 --> 03:05:30.799
ASHLEY: That is so beautiful.

03:05:30.799 --> 03:05:38.620
MATT: She did an incredible job. The exchange is
done, you have your map. Anything else you guys

03:05:38.620 --> 03:05:39.945
want to handle?

03:05:39.945 --> 03:05:40.682
TALIESIN: Medi-kit?

03:05:40.682 --> 03:05:42.161
MARISHA: I got it.

03:05:42.161 --> 03:05:49.157
LAURA: Can I just look around and see if there's
anything interesting to buy in here, like--

03:05:52.477 --> 03:05:58.639
MATT: There's plenty of tools. There are various
packs of supplies.

03:05:59.120 --> 03:06:07.321
LAURA: I guess if I bought the painter's kit then
it just stays and I don't run out of that.

03:06:07.321 --> 03:06:09.247
MATT: Over time you would run out of it.

03:06:09.247 --> 03:06:10.298
LAURA: But I'm good on paint?

03:06:10.298 --> 03:06:12.105
MATT: Good for a while.

03:06:12.105 --> 03:06:16.443
TRAVIS: Can I actually approach the storekeep and
say: do you know of any stores that have arcane

03:06:16.443 --> 03:06:21.337
items, things with magical properties, healing
potions?

03:06:21.337 --> 03:06:28.507
MATT: "I'm sorry, we're a bit out of the center of
the country for arcane items. You'd want to go

03:06:28.507 --> 03:06:29.936
further north for that."

03:06:29.936 --> 03:06:32.422
TRAVIS: Further north? I appreciate your time,
thank you.

03:06:32.422 --> 03:06:33.720
MATT: "Of course."

03:06:33.720 --> 03:06:35.272
MARISHA: This town blows.

03:06:35.272 --> 03:06:38.511
TRAVIS: She's right fucking there.

03:06:38.511 --> 03:06:40.021
MARISHA: I don't care.

03:06:41.828 --> 03:06:44.520
[laughter]

03:06:48.301 --> 03:06:49.909
TRAVIS: Shall we depart?

03:06:50.989 --> 03:06:56.674
LAURA: Sure. Thank you so much for this beautiful
map. You did a really good job drawing it.

03:07:01.444 --> 03:07:02.761
MATT: Take your map.

03:07:05.051 --> 03:07:08.111
ASHLEY: I also really like what you've done with
the place.

03:07:09.166 --> 03:07:11.790
MATT: "Thank you very much--"

03:07:13.574 --> 03:07:15.887
MARISHA: Let's go, bye! Thank you!

03:07:15.887 --> 03:07:16.987
MATT: "I-- um..."

03:07:16.987 --> 03:07:17.987
TRAVIS: Gotta go!

03:07:17.987 --> 03:07:19.342
MARISHA: [bell dangling noises]

03:07:19.342 --> 03:07:23.120
MATT: As you guys all exit, she begins to come
around the counter.

03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:27.151
TALIESIN: I like the idea of you just
standing there going, [bell dangling noises]

03:07:31.185 --> 03:07:35.810
LAURA: Wherever we go, I'm going to bury my head
in the map and walk behind everybody like a total

03:07:35.810 --> 03:07:37.454
tourist.

03:07:38.815 --> 03:07:45.509
TALIESIN: Well, that's the question: are we going
to be able to grab a cart or two from the circus?

03:07:45.509 --> 03:07:47.433
MATT: You can probably get a cart.

03:07:47.433 --> 03:07:53.925
TALIESIN: Like one of the little vardos? Can we
snag a vardo?

03:07:53.925 --> 03:08:02.462
MATT: Technically it's &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; vardo and the three of
them took it. There's a vardo and then there's

03:08:02.462 --> 03:08:08.376
some carts. You weren't rolling with a pretty
heavy-- honestly, most of the room in the carts

03:08:08.376 --> 03:08:15.543
was either for carrying you guys, whatever small
bags you had with you, and the poles you would

03:08:15.543 --> 03:08:22.893
assemble to make the tent. Are you guys done with
your business? Anything else you want to do while

03:08:22.893 --> 03:08:24.169
you're out and about?

03:08:24.169 --> 03:08:25.224
TRAVIS: That's it for me.

03:08:25.224 --> 03:08:28.651
LAURA: There's nowhere we can buy healing potions
in this city?

03:08:28.651 --> 03:08:35.601
MATT: There's Natural Remedies, which you've
passed before, but not entered. It's an herbal

03:08:35.601 --> 03:08:37.350
healers establishment.

03:08:37.350 --> 03:08:38.650
LAURA: Let's try that.

03:08:38.650 --> 03:08:40.388
TALIESIN: I'm very wary of this, but fine.

03:08:40.388 --> 03:08:42.662
TRAVIS: It's going to smell like "Sephoria," I
know it.

03:08:42.662 --> 03:08:44.909
LAURA: Sephora.

03:08:44.909 --> 03:08:49.383
TRAVIS: That's the fancy version.

03:08:49.383 --> 03:08:54.300
MATT: Now, you guys had left earlier, so as you
guys head toward Natural Remedies, you guys finish

03:08:54.300 --> 03:08:56.266
your bath.

03:08:56.266 --> 03:09:06.709
LIAM: I pack up. I said we're staying for an
hour, so I cast Disguise Self again to

03:09:06.709 --> 03:09:10.794
keep the illusion going. I'm done, you look--

03:09:10.794 --> 03:09:14.149
SAM: I splashed some water on my face.

03:09:14.149 --> 03:09:15.130
LIAM: --refreshed.

03:09:15.130 --> 03:09:20.323
SAM: Oh, it was such a good bath. I'm ready to go
now, I feel refreshed.

03:09:20.323 --> 03:09:21.530
LIAM: Did you like it, though?

03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:24.145
SAM: It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

03:09:24.145 --> 03:09:28.678
LIAM: I wanted to repay you for all you've done
for me for the past couple of days.

03:09:28.678 --> 03:09:40.334
SAM: Consider it paid! You look the same. Does he
look the same?

03:09:40.334 --> 03:09:41.369
MATT: Yeah.

03:09:41.369 --> 03:09:47.898
LIAM: The brief moment that I was in my own guise
nothing changed up here, so I look exactly the way

03:09:47.898 --> 03:09:49.643
I did this morning.

03:09:49.643 --> 03:09:51.510
LAURA: What's the purpose of that?

03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:57.459
LIAM: Who said that? You wanted to do something,
right?

03:09:57.459 --> 03:10:01.213
SAM: I wanted to go to Herbal Remedies and see if
we could get you a healing potion.

03:10:01.213 --> 03:10:07.805
LIAM: Let's do that, then. You lead the way. Well
wait, you lead the way outside. Let's keep our

03:10:07.805 --> 03:10:11.313
little schtick going here and then off we go.

03:10:11.313 --> 03:10:13.105
MATT: All right. As you guys exit--

03:10:13.105 --> 03:10:14.286
SAM: Auf Wiedersehen!

03:10:14.286 --> 03:10:19.594
MATT: "I trust you enjoyed your time at the bath,
thank you."

03:10:19.594 --> 03:10:24.482
LIAM: Yes, but we have to go. Sorry, I'm late for
a very important appointment. I drag Nott right

03:10:24.482 --> 03:10:26.916
out of here because I saw no doorknob on the
door.

03:10:26.916 --> 03:10:34.352
MATT: Yeah, amongst other things. You guys make
your way out and beeline it towards the Lochward

03:10:34.352 --> 03:10:40.555
to where you would find Natural Remedies. The rest
of you guys, as you approach the exterior, amongst the

03:10:40.607 --> 03:10:48.039
rest of the buildings in the central city, Natural
Remedies is, for lack of a better term, humble.

03:10:48.039 --> 03:10:54.265
It's a small shack, but as soon as you approach it
has very strong, pungent smells of funguses.

03:10:54.265 --> 03:10:58.708
TRAVIS: Instant headache.

03:10:58.708 --> 03:11:05.822
MATT: Yep. On the outside you can see, right where
the doorway is open, there are strings of herbs

03:11:05.822 --> 03:11:10.392
that are tied up and left to dry out. On the
inside, you can already see that there are shelves

03:11:10.392 --> 03:11:17.434
of various flora and fauna that are being
cultivated for various remedies and means of

03:11:17.434 --> 03:11:25.692
selling to anybody who wants to come by and
procure herbal medicines. Let's see who's

03:11:25.692 --> 03:11:32.022
handling this one, because you guys have not been
here yet. As you enter the main chamber--

03:11:32.022 --> 03:11:37.950
LIAM: Sorry, I will say that on the way there
that I dropped the disguise, somewhere.

03:11:37.950 --> 03:11:43.136
MATT: Okay, easily enough, so you guys haven't
arrived yet. You guys have arrived. As you enter the interior,

03:11:43.136 --> 03:11:50.547
it's a very musty smell on the inside, too.
There's a lot of fungus being grown on the inside

03:11:50.547 --> 03:11:55.248
here, and you can see that elements of it may have
expanded into the corners of the actual room and

03:11:55.248 --> 03:12:05.541
it's not necessarily the nicest space to be
wandering in. It seems natural. Across the way,

03:12:05.541 --> 03:12:16.628
you see a gentleman of relatively tanned skin,
with darker hair that's ratty and clustered. He's

03:12:16.628 --> 03:12:25.368
in his late twenties or so, looks to be upon
closer inspection partial elven blood, partial

03:12:25.368 --> 03:12:33.489
human blood, and he's in the process of carefully
carving a large stalk of what looks like a fungus

03:12:33.489 --> 03:12:38.842
off of a small pot that he pulled off one of the
shelves. As you enter, he doesn't even make eye

03:12:38.842 --> 03:12:49.603
contact. He goes, "Hello, please, just wait a
moment. There we are. Hi, can I help you?"

03:12:49.603 --> 03:12:54.908
LAURA: Yeah, my friends keep dying. Do you have any
health potions?

03:12:54.908 --> 03:13:03.641
MATT: "We have a handful, that is correct. How
many are you looking to purchase?"

03:13:03.641 --> 03:13:06.060
LAURA: How many do you have?

03:13:06.060 --> 03:13:09.693
MATT: "Four."

03:13:09.693 --> 03:13:14.049
LAURA: Ooh. That will last us probably, like, a
day.

03:13:14.049 --> 03:13:17.247
MATT: "What do you do for a living?"

03:13:17.247 --> 03:13:19.068
LAURA: We're superheroes.

03:13:19.068 --> 03:13:20.650
TALIESIN: Sword jugglers.

03:13:20.650 --> 03:13:24.285
MATT: "Why would-- Fine, who am I to ask?"

03:13:24.285 --> 03:13:25.948
MARISHA: Look at this bruise.

03:13:25.948 --> 03:13:27.363
MATT: "I cut fungus for a living."

03:13:27.363 --> 03:13:29.631
MARISHA: Look, it's in the shape of a dick.

03:13:29.631 --> 03:13:35.391
MATT: "I'm not going to ask. Four? Did you want
them?"

03:13:35.391 --> 03:13:38.955
LAURA: Sure, yes. How much for four healing
potions?

03:13:38.955 --> 03:13:45.427
MATT: "For four healing potions," and he pulls
them out and plops them on the table, "240 gold pieces."

03:13:45.427 --> 03:13:48.182
TALIESIN: Level two.

03:13:48.182 --> 03:13:54.716
LAURA: Okay, hold on. I open up my pack and I pour
out all my money. I start counting it.

03:13:54.716 --> 03:14:05.478
ASHLEY: Do you have a deal, you know, if we got
all of them? That seems pretty high. Right? That

03:14:05.478 --> 03:14:07.917
seems pretty high for a healing potion.

03:14:07.917 --> 03:14:17.418
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.
Yasha: the wheeler and dealer.

03:14:17.418 --> 03:14:22.679
ASHLEY: Three.

03:14:22.679 --> 03:14:34.284
MATT: "No, actually, I think it's rather standard
in these parts. But I can put them back."

03:14:34.284 --> 03:14:38.555
TALIESIN: Healing potions aside, you are doing
something really interesting and exciting here.

03:14:38.555 --> 03:14:45.232
You're not a healing potion dealer. What are you
doing here? Like this is fascinating.

03:14:45.232 --> 03:14:58.147
MATT: "Oh, I create all sorts of means of tending
to wounds and loss of stamina. To be honest, a lot

03:14:58.147 --> 03:15:01.858
"of people come around here for
performance-enhancing fungus."

03:15:01.858 --> 03:15:08.293
TALIESIN: I don't know, I feel like you can excite
me. I feel like there's something that you have to

03:15:08.293 --> 03:15:11.911
show that's really exciting. I'm not entirely sure
it's all about stamina, I think you've got

03:15:11.911 --> 03:15:19.497
something-- you did that on purpose. Talk to me
like I'm a child, show me something I've never

03:15:19.497 --> 03:15:21.174
seen before.

03:15:21.174 --> 03:15:24.753
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:15:24.753 --> 03:15:30.077
TALIESIN: Not with advantage, because I don't have
it, but I was so excited.

03:15:30.077 --> 03:15:31.310
MATT: Nope.

03:15:31.310 --> 03:15:45.766
TALIESIN: Persuasion check. 19. I'm fishing for
drugs, I'm not going to lie. I've been on the road

03:15:45.766 --> 03:15:47.586
a long time, I don't remember how to do this.

03:15:47.586 --> 03:16:00.306
MATT: He leans in close to you. "Mind closing the
door?"

03:16:00.349 --> 03:16:06.112
TALIESIN: I skip over to the door and gingerly
close it.

03:16:06.112 --> 03:16:13.918
MATT: "Keep curious company, that's true."

03:16:13.918 --> 03:16:18.170
TALIESIN: Yes, I do. And we're leaving town
today.

03:16:18.170 --> 03:16:25.195
MATT: "Those are magical words for a man of my
business. Are you a fan of skein?"

03:16:25.195 --> 03:16:27.416
TALIESIN: I don't actually know what that is.

03:16:27.416 --> 03:16:37.564
MATT: "Well," and he goes back into the back
chamber, comes back with a small satchel. There's

03:16:37.564 --> 03:16:46.844
a finely dried, dusted material on the inside, it
has a grayish-blue color to it. He goes, "This is

03:16:46.844 --> 03:16:53.570
"a dried and ground fungus called skein. It's
called skein because when you eat it you can see

03:16:53.570 --> 03:16:55.764
"the weave of time."

03:16:55.764 --> 03:16:58.899
MARISHA: Is that what skein means?

03:16:58.899 --> 03:17:02.300
MATT: "It's a woven skein, it's a joke on fate--
never mind."

03:17:02.300 --> 03:17:04.844
TALIESIN: I thought it was very clever.

03:17:04.844 --> 03:17:10.788
MATT: "Thank you very much. It's effective, it's
popular on the outskirts where it's not so heavily

03:17:10.788 --> 03:17:15.913
"controlled and carries a huge jail-time if caught.
How much are you looking to purchase?"

03:17:15.913 --> 03:17:22.513
TALIESIN: I've got to be honest, I'm not made of
money, but I'm always curious for a new experience.

03:17:22.513 --> 03:17:25.503
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on this guy?

03:17:25.503 --> 03:17:26.715
MATT: Sure, go for it.

03:17:26.715 --> 03:17:28.043
MARISHA: See if he's trying to scam us.

03:17:28.043 --> 03:17:29.342
MATT: Go for it.

03:17:29.342 --> 03:17:32.463
MARISHA: Can I use my criminal background?

03:17:32.463 --> 03:17:33.889
MATT: Sure.

03:17:33.889 --> 03:17:42.422
LIAM: All right, Marisha said that, not
Beauregard.

03:17:42.422 --> 03:17:47.015
MARISHA: To know if he's actually giving what he's
giving?

03:17:47.015 --> 03:17:51.826
MATT: You know what? Make your insight check.

03:17:51.826 --> 03:17:54.158
MARISHA: Just straight insight.

03:17:54.158 --> 03:17:55.686
MATT: Straight insight.

03:17:55.686 --> 03:18:02.080
MARISHA: It's not as good as I would've hoped.
18.

03:18:02.080 --> 03:18:04.275
MATT: Not as good as I hoped: 18.

03:18:04.275 --> 03:18:08.570
LIAM: That's a slam dunk at level two.

03:18:08.570 --> 03:18:14.599
MATT: Seems on the level, seems excited that
somebody's asking about it. You get the sense

03:18:14.599 --> 03:18:18.612
that maybe he makes a lot of this either for
himself or in hopes that somebody asks about it

03:18:18.612 --> 03:18:25.322
and is seemingly excited that somebody in this
bumfuck town, in his opinion, would even have

03:18:25.322 --> 03:18:30.374
interest. You have once encountered this substance
before, and it does seem legit.

03:18:30.374 --> 03:18:32.450
MARISHA: Okay.

03:18:32.450 --> 03:18:38.544
ASHLEY: How do we know if it's good quality,
though? Can I give it a sample?

03:18:38.544 --> 03:18:42.357
TALIESIN: Well, this might be complicated, I think
that just-- What would--

03:18:42.357 --> 03:18:44.497
TRAVIS: How about a few experiences?

03:18:44.497 --> 03:18:46.247
TALIESIN: A few experiences' worth. What would that
run me?

03:18:46.247 --> 03:18:52.797
MATT: Hey guys, we're dealing D&amp;amp;D drugs.

03:18:52.797 --> 03:18:55.975
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for dragging
the entire audience into this. Hopefully your

03:18:55.975 --> 03:18:58.986
children are already asleep, I do apologize.

03:18:58.986 --> 03:19:02.585
SAM: D&amp;amp;D Beyond, everybody. Our sponsor for the
evening.

03:19:02.585 --> 03:19:10.128
TALIESIN: Thank you for really bringing that to
earth for me. You started this.

03:19:10.128 --> 03:19:13.615
MATT: "I'll put you in at a gold an experience,
how about that?"

03:19:13.615 --> 03:19:19.381
TALIESIN: All right. Yeah, put me in for one. I'll
try anything once.

03:19:19.381 --> 03:19:30.479
MATT: He takes a small little batch of this dried,
powdered fungus, and puts it into a small glass

03:19:30.479 --> 03:19:32.273
vial, corks it, and hands it over.

03:19:32.273 --> 03:19:36.457
ASHLEY: Well, you might as well make another one.
I'm not going to let my friend experience it alone.

03:19:36.457 --> 03:19:37.889
TALIESIN: What's it called? Skein?

03:19:37.889 --> 03:19:41.323
MATT: Skein. S-K-E-I-N. I believe that's how it's
spelled.

03:19:41.323 --> 03:19:44.887
LAURA: Yasha, you should take it with them. Right
now. It'll be fun.

03:19:44.887 --> 03:19:51.373
TALIESIN: No, this is not how this works. This is
not how this works. We bank our moments for those

03:19:51.373 --> 03:19:53.363
moments when life is disappointing.

03:19:53.363 --> 03:19:55.702
TRAVIS: I know a unique substance when I see it,
I'll take one as well.

03:19:55.702 --> 03:19:56.842
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

03:19:56.842 --> 03:19:58.189
MARISHA: One for me too.

03:19:58.189 --> 03:19:59.720
TALIESIN: This can come in handy in all sorts of
ways.

03:19:59.720 --> 03:20:06.309
MATT: God damn it, guys.

03:20:06.309 --> 03:20:12.491
TALIESIN: The fact that you had this ready means
that there is no shame here. You were ready for this.

03:20:12.491 --> 03:20:16.167
MATT: You're right, I am not making any of this up
on the spot at all.

03:20:16.167 --> 03:20:17.419
TALIESIN: I know, I can tell!

03:20:17.419 --> 03:20:24.035
LIAM: This guy went from the Simpson's Safeway
clerk to the shadiest motherfucker in a snap of

03:20:24.035 --> 03:20:26.262
time, because of your question.

03:20:26.262 --> 03:20:30.182
TALIESIN: A big, purple, pierced demon walked into
the room and was like, hello.

03:20:30.182 --> 03:20:34.275
LIAM: Yes, can I help you, good sir? Yes, I can
help you.

03:20:34.275 --> 03:20:39.040
TRAVIS: I'll tell you what, because you are such a
purveyor of such interesting items, I will take

03:20:39.040 --> 03:20:45.881
one of those health potions, but for 50 gold.
That's the running price I've seen in neighboring

03:20:45.881 --> 03:20:48.437
towns, and I don't mean to be swindled.

03:20:48.437 --> 03:20:57.143
MARISHA: I assume you'd want to go ahead and give
it to us for that so that we keep this a secret.

03:20:57.143 --> 03:21:01.208
MATT: Make a persuasion check, with advantage.

03:21:01.208 --> 03:21:09.269
TRAVIS: 21.

03:21:09.269 --> 03:21:19.687
MATT: "50 gold," and he pulls his hair back a bit,
"Seems fair." Takes a potion and hands it over. He

03:21:19.687 --> 03:21:24.412
scoops a little vial and says, "And for fun." He
throws it over.

03:21:24.412 --> 03:21:29.267
LIAM: You fucking badass.

03:21:29.267 --> 03:21:33.524
SAM: Cut to an hour later, and someone's jamming
an adrenaline needle.

03:21:33.524 --> 03:21:41.233
MATT: TPK by misuse?

03:21:41.233 --> 03:21:47.037
TALIESIN: Somewhere around level eight, this is
going to be hilarious. Somewhere around level

03:21:47.037 --> 03:21:50.392
eight somebody's going to go shopping and the rest
of us are going to be like: this is now, this is

03:21:50.392 --> 03:21:52.066
happening now.

03:21:52.066 --> 03:21:55.409
MATT: This has become the longest afterschool
special I think we've ever experienced.

03:21:55.409 --> 03:21:57.294
TALIESIN: Years in the making.

03:21:57.294 --> 03:22:05.302
MATT: He immediately gets nervous at her mention
of--

03:22:05.302 --> 03:22:09.220
TALIESIN: She's fine, she's just awful, you're a
gentleman, I hope to see you again. I'm looking

03:22:09.220 --> 03:22:10.821
forward to this.

03:22:10.821 --> 03:22:11.909
MATT: "I'll be here."

03:22:11.909 --> 03:22:14.688
TALIESIN: Of course, we never met you, you never
met us.

03:22:14.688 --> 03:22:16.578
MATT: "Of course not. I don't know who you are."

03:22:16.578 --> 03:22:21.897
TALIESIN: I am already out the door, with a
flourish.

03:22:21.897 --> 03:22:26.161
MATT: At which point, you run outside just as
Caleb and Nott are approaching.

03:22:26.161 --> 03:22:33.261
MARISHA: Before I go out I say, nice to meet you,
mister--?

03:22:33.261 --> 03:22:42.632
MATT: "Davies."

03:22:42.632 --> 03:22:50.970
TRAVIS: The decision was still happening by the
time you got to the last letter.

03:22:50.970 --> 03:22:58.933
MARISHA: I go: Okay, Davies.

03:22:58.933 --> 03:23:10.745
LAURA: I guess I'll scoop my money back into
my pouch and leave.

03:23:10.745 --> 03:23:13.897
MARISHA: Do you want anything?

03:23:13.897 --> 03:23:15.794
LAURA: No.

03:23:15.794 --> 03:23:18.915
MATT: You bump into Caleb and Nott on the way
out.

03:23:18.915 --> 03:23:22.445
LIAM: What's the matter, do you have a cold?

03:23:22.445 --> 03:23:26.504
LAURA: You don't smell bad, what did you do?

03:23:26.504 --> 03:23:32.644
MATT: Actually, ironically, his clothes do still
smell pretty bad, and he still looks awful.

03:23:32.644 --> 03:23:35.678
LAURA: You don't smell as bad.

03:23:35.678 --> 03:23:39.173
MATT: That's true, on a gradient scale, he does
smell a little better.

03:23:39.173 --> 03:23:42.344
LIAM: I will take that as a compliment, thank you.
What are you guys doing here, are you shopping?

03:23:42.344 --> 03:23:43.702
What do they have in there?

03:23:43.702 --> 03:23:45.466
LAURA: They bought drugs.

03:23:45.466 --> 03:23:47.554
TRAVIS: That is an over-exaggeration.

03:23:47.554 --> 03:23:50.223
TALIESIN: That is an extreme over-exaggeration. We
got a health potion.

03:23:50.223 --> 03:23:51.598
SAM: All of you?

03:23:51.598 --> 03:23:54.656
MARISHA: Well, it was kind of a ploy to get a
cheaper health potion.

03:23:54.656 --> 03:23:55.602
TALIESIN: It worked.

03:23:55.602 --> 03:23:59.789
MARISHA: And we got drugs on top of it. It was a
win-win, am I right?

03:23:59.789 --> 03:24:04.188
LAURA: If you guys go in there and you buy a
health potion, don't spend as much as he says,

03:24:04.188 --> 03:24:06.166
because apparently he was lying.

03:24:06.166 --> 03:24:08.136
LIAM: How much do they run for?

03:24:08.136 --> 03:24:13.562
TRAVIS: Health potions were quoted at 70, but he
was kind enough to understand that 50 was enough.

03:24:13.562 --> 03:24:15.012
LIAM: 70?

03:24:15.012 --> 03:24:16.710
TRAVIS: Gold pieces.

03:24:16.710 --> 03:24:18.745
SAM: North we go.

03:24:18.745 --> 03:24:21.326
TALIESIN: North, to the horses.

03:24:21.326 --> 03:24:23.672
LIAM: We have a plan for the day?

03:24:23.672 --> 03:24:34.201
LAURA: Yes, and I show them the map that we just
got. We're heading that way. Can I take the ribbon

03:24:34.201 --> 03:24:37.173
that was wrapped around the map and tie it around
one of my horns?

03:24:37.173 --> 03:24:38.455
MATT: Easily enough.

03:24:38.455 --> 03:24:40.300
MARISHA: That's cute.

03:24:40.300 --> 03:24:41.341
LAURA: Thank you.

03:24:41.341 --> 03:24:43.706
SAM: We could rob the store.

03:24:43.706 --> 03:24:48.482
LIAM: Do you have a strategy for that?

03:24:48.482 --> 03:24:55.401
SAM: I mean, we could use one of our pre-planned
strategies.

03:24:55.401 --> 03:25:00.141
LIAM: Which one would that be? Because I was
thinking about it on the walk here and I can't

03:25:00.141 --> 03:25:01.890
think which one applies.

03:25:01.890 --> 03:25:11.792
TALIESIN: I was going to say, robbing shady people
is usually a bad idea.

03:25:11.792 --> 03:25:14.949
MARISHA: Do we hear them doing these plans? Do we
hear you guys making this plan?

03:25:14.949 --> 03:25:17.497
LIAM: No, I wouldn't be saying this out loud if
you're close.

03:25:17.497 --> 03:25:24.131
SAM: We could just do the simplest: the Prince and
the Pauper.

03:25:24.131 --> 03:25:35.450
LIAM: Here's the thing, I have died almost twice
in two days. We have our friends and I think

03:25:35.450 --> 03:25:37.690
that's a good way to start.

03:25:37.690 --> 03:25:38.899
SAM: All right.

03:25:38.899 --> 03:25:42.776
LIAM: I mean, you know, we almost all got pinched
yesterday.

03:25:42.776 --> 03:25:54.183
SAM: You're right, we should leave town with our
wits about us and full of health. Let's just go

03:25:54.183 --> 03:25:58.439
while we're ahead. Besides, I got plenty of stuff
today.

03:25:58.439 --> 03:26:02.104
LIAM: You and me?

03:26:02.104 --> 03:26:03.697
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

03:26:03.697 --> 03:26:07.787
LIAM: All right. Okay, where are we going first?

03:26:07.787 --> 03:26:13.508
LAURA: We're heading north to--

03:26:13.508 --> 03:26:15.449
LIAM: Is it this big?

03:26:15.449 --> 03:26:17.169
MATT: That's the size of the map.

03:26:17.169 --> 03:26:27.091
LAURA: I mean, we can stop through Alfield first
and see if there's anything cool there, or-- what

03:26:27.091 --> 03:26:30.524
city was it that the academy was in?

03:26:30.524 --> 03:26:34.923
MARISHA: "Solstryce?"

03:26:34.923 --> 03:26:37.460
MATT and TRAVIS: Soltryce.

03:26:37.460 --> 03:26:39.387
MARISHA: Is that the name of the town?

03:26:39.387 --> 03:26:42.859
TALIESIN: No, I don't think it's the name of the
town.

03:26:42.859 --> 03:26:47.598
LAURA: I mean, the ultimate goal, you guys, is to
get to Hupperdook, but--

03:26:47.598 --> 03:26:49.103
TALIESIN: What about Yogurt?

03:26:49.103 --> 03:26:52.186
LAURA: That's an afterthought.

03:26:52.186 --> 03:26:55.086
TALIESIN: It usually is.

03:26:55.086 --> 03:26:57.236
LIAM: How far off does Hupperdook look?

03:26:57.236 --> 03:27:02.762
LAURA: Well, we have to pass through Felderwin and
the Felderwin Village first.

03:27:02.808 --> 03:27:04.416
SAM: Let's skip that one, please.

03:27:04.416 --> 03:27:11.818
LAURA: Oh, is that the one you don't like? Okay,
then we'll go up through Alfield, and then Zadash,

03:27:11.818 --> 03:27:15.448
and then we'll cut across and go to Hupperdook.

03:27:15.448 --> 03:27:17.757
MARISHA: Is that where your clan is from?

03:27:17.757 --> 03:27:20.749
SAM: They roam about.

03:27:20.749 --> 03:27:22.873
ASHLEY: You don't want to go to Zadash, is that
right?

03:27:22.873 --> 03:27:26.777
MARISHA: Nah, it's cool. We can go back.

03:27:26.777 --> 03:27:28.765
TRAVIS: It's cool now?

03:27:28.765 --> 03:27:37.020
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, there's a few places that I
didn't get to see in my sight-seeing roundabout,

03:27:37.020 --> 03:27:42.320
didn't get to hit everything. Now that I've slept
on it, I've had a change of heart. It's a nice town.

03:27:42.320 --> 03:27:47.677
LAURA: How long of a travel would it be to get to
Zadash from where we are now?

03:27:47.677 --> 03:27:58.295
MATT: Following the road is longer, but it's
safest. That'll probably be close to 200 miles to Zadash.

03:27:58.295 --> 03:28:01.039
SAM: Jesus. We're on foot.

03:28:01.039 --> 03:28:02.709
TALIESIN: No, we've got a cart.

03:28:02.709 --> 03:28:04.028
SAM: A cart.

03:28:04.028 --> 03:28:07.736
MATT: You do have a cart. A single cart.

03:28:07.736 --> 03:28:22.433
LAURA: A horse? Let's go back to the inn and ask
Yorda if she knows if Alfield is a big city.

03:28:22.433 --> 03:28:26.067
LIAM: Do I have any knowledge of Alfield?

03:28:26.067 --> 03:28:28.166
TALIESIN: I came though Alfield, didn't I?

03:28:28.166 --> 03:28:33.164
MATT: No, you guys traveled around. You went from
Felderwin, and curved around to the Ustaloch.

03:28:33.164 --> 03:28:34.519
TALIESIN: That's right.

03:28:34.519 --> 03:28:41.731
MATT: Alfield is actually slightly smaller than
Trostenwald, it's a stop on the way to Zadash.

03:28:41.731 --> 03:28:47.668
Zadash is the second-largest city in the kingdom.

03:28:47.668 --> 03:28:51.344
MARISHA: What do I know about Zadash that I could
tell them? Can I tell them anything?

03:28:51.344 --> 03:28:58.670
MATT: It was the last conquered bastion of the
previous government before the empire entirely

03:28:58.670 --> 03:28:59.911
took the valley.

03:28:59.911 --> 03:29:04.165
MARISHA: That's right. Zadash is on the edge of
the empire too, right?

03:29:04.165 --> 03:29:09.186
MATT: It was, but now it's more central. It
expanded past and took over Trostenwald, Alfield,

03:29:09.186 --> 03:29:11.238
it expanded all the way into the valley.

03:29:11.238 --> 03:29:14.086
LIAM: Will you share your map with me for just
one minute?

03:29:14.086 --> 03:29:15.501
LAURA: Of course.

03:29:15.501 --> 03:29:21.075
SAM: This is a good trick he does. He can look at
it once and it will stay with him forever.

03:29:21.075 --> 03:29:22.658
LAURA: Really?

03:29:22.658 --> 03:29:30.955
SAM: Yes, it's amazing, you can quiz him on it later.
While he's memorizing it, Yasha, is that your name again?

03:29:30.955 --> 03:29:33.081
ASHLEY: Yasha.

03:29:33.081 --> 03:29:35.746
SAM; It's like Ash, with an -ay.

03:29:35.746 --> 03:29:41.107
ASHLEY: Not really, but close enough.

03:29:41.107 --> 03:29:43.156
SAM: I got you these flowers.

03:29:43.156 --> 03:29:44.488
ASHLEY: Oh.

03:29:44.488 --> 03:29:52.530
SAM: Thought that they might gussy you up a bit.
It's a lot of drab colors. Also, maybe you won't

03:29:52.530 --> 03:29:53.978
kill me now.

03:29:53.978 --> 03:29:55.622
ASHLEY: I'm not going to kill you.

03:29:55.622 --> 03:29:57.305
SAM: I know, I gave you the flowers.

03:29:57.305 --> 03:30:00.622
ASHLEY: All right, well.

03:30:00.622 --> 03:30:02.724
SAM: Girls like flowers.

03:30:02.724 --> 03:30:04.104
LAURA: I love flowers, did you get me any?

03:30:04.104 --> 03:30:06.706
SAM: I didn't, because you're less of a threat.

03:30:06.706 --> 03:30:10.274
LAURA: You don't know that.

03:30:10.274 --> 03:30:12.281
ASHLEY: That was very nice of you, thank you.

03:30:12.281 --> 03:30:13.800
SAM: Sure!

03:30:13.800 --> 03:30:16.085
MARISHA: Didn't peg you for a flowers type of
girl.

03:30:16.085 --> 03:30:18.116
SAM: All girls like flowers.

03:30:18.116 --> 03:30:31.501
ASHLEY: I take out a book that I have and in
between some of the pages is a four-leaf clover.

03:30:31.501 --> 03:30:38.829
I'll take the flowers and I'll put them in between
the other pages, and I'll put it away.

03:30:38.829 --> 03:30:40.504
SAM: You see?

03:30:40.504 --> 03:30:44.848
(laughter)

03:30:44.848 --> 03:30:50.126
SAM: It doesn't hurt to be nice sometimes.

03:30:50.126 --> 03:30:52.900
MARISHA: I mean, it can, though.

03:30:52.900 --> 03:30:57.520
SAM: Well it hurts &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.

03:30:57.520 --> 03:31:02.414
LIAM: It looks like somebody was very nice to you
the night before, over and over again.

03:31:02.414 --> 03:31:03.739
MARISHA: Oh, she was.

03:31:03.739 --> 03:31:07.251
LAURA: You guys, we are going to Zadash. Is that
what we're saying, we're going to go to Zadash?

03:31:07.251 --> 03:31:10.636
LIAM: Sure, let's do that. What's our goal in
Zadash?

03:31:10.636 --> 03:31:13.936
LAURA: I don't know, I just need to know where
we're going, okay?

03:31:13.936 --> 03:31:15.962
MARISHA: That's on the way to the "Solstryce"
Academy?

03:31:15.962 --> 03:31:29.794
MATT: The Soltryce. Solstice, I can see you mixing
it up. The Soltryce is technically in Rexxentrum,

03:31:29.794 --> 03:31:31.442
which is the capital of the empire.

03:31:31.442 --> 03:31:32.760
LAURA: Which is a lot farther.

03:31:32.760 --> 03:31:40.433
MATT: Which is a lot farther. Zadash does have the
only other subsidiary of the academy there, but

03:31:40.433 --> 03:31:44.559
the main Soltryce academy is in Rexxentrum, the
capital. But Zadash has some connection to it.

03:31:44.559 --> 03:31:45.997
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

03:31:45.997 --> 03:31:50.061
LIAM: Unless you're a foreigner, everyone knows
about Rexxentrum.

03:31:50.061 --> 03:32:00.789
MATT: Yes, it's huge. For player comparison, it's
twice the size of Emon. It's a massive city.

03:32:00.789 --> 03:32:02.419
LAURA: Zadash?

03:32:02.419 --> 03:32:04.193
MATT: No, not Zadash, Rexxentrum.

03:32:04.193 --> 03:32:07.102
LIAM: Zadash is medium, or smaller.

03:32:07.102 --> 03:32:10.325
LAURA: Okay. Yeah.

03:32:10.325 --> 03:32:15.424
LIAM: How far did that map say, when I looked
at it? 200 miles you said to Zadash?

03:32:15.424 --> 03:32:19.507
MATT: To Zadash, roughly 200 miles or so, if
you're taking the road, quicker if you take a

03:32:19.507 --> 03:32:21.085
straight line, but you're not as safe.

03:32:21.085 --> 03:32:28.434
LIAM: Well, I think it's good.

03:32:28.434 --> 03:32:30.991
SAM: Are we going to walk there? Should we get
horses?

03:32:30.991 --> 03:32:32.362
TALIESIN: We have a horse.

03:32:32.362 --> 03:32:33.468
LIAM: How many horses?

03:32:33.468 --> 03:32:34.294
TALIESIN: We have a horse.

03:32:34.294 --> 03:32:39.116
MARISHA: A horse and a carriage. I'm assuming it
can't fit all of us.

03:32:39.116 --> 03:32:40.315
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a wagon.

03:32:40.315 --> 03:32:41.532
TALIESIN: We have a wagon.

03:32:41.532 --> 03:32:46.219
MATT: It'll be about the same pace as on foot. At
a fast pace on foot, you guys can traverse about

03:32:46.219 --> 03:32:53.783
30 miles a day. That also means you're moving at a
fast pace, so you're not being completely aware of

03:32:53.783 --> 03:33:00.270
your surroundings, you have a penalty to passively
seeing things around you. But you get there quicker.

03:33:00.270 --> 03:33:01.633
TRAVIS: I like it.

03:33:01.633 --> 03:33:03.953
TALIESIN: Why be fast? What are we in a rush for?

03:33:03.953 --> 03:33:05.976
LAURA: We can sightsee.

03:33:05.976 --> 03:33:08.155
TALIESIN: I find careful is always best.

03:33:08.155 --> 03:33:12.953
LIAM: A couple of weeks on the road to a city
bigger than this one.

03:33:12.953 --> 03:33:15.442
MARISHA: Are we all going to get along for a
couple of weeks?

03:33:15.442 --> 03:33:16.944
SAM: We'll find out, I suppose.

03:33:16.944 --> 03:33:19.143
LAURA: I get along with everyone, Beau.

03:33:19.143 --> 03:33:20.567
MARISHA: That's true, that's true.

03:33:20.567 --> 03:33:21.845
TALIESIN: I don't get along with anybody.

03:33:21.845 --> 03:33:23.424
MARISHA: That's also true.

03:33:23.424 --> 03:33:31.845
LIAM: Two weeks is not a bad test run for
companions. If we don't like it, we part ways in Zadash.

03:33:31.845 --> 03:33:39.485
TRAVIS: Yeah, free to go at any time. As long as
it serves everyone, we'll stay this way.

03:33:39.485 --> 03:33:53.189
ASHLEY: I think I need to stay here just a little
bit longer. But I will meet you guys there at some point?

03:33:53.189 --> 03:33:57.283
SAM: Why?! What're you doing?

03:33:57.283 --> 03:33:59.119
LIAM: You have something else to do?

03:33:59.119 --> 03:34:07.081
ASHLEY: I just don't think I can leave here until
I'm told I can.

03:34:07.081 --> 03:34:11.358
SAM: By the authorities?

03:34:11.358 --> 03:34:12.987
ASHLEY: No, I just--

03:34:12.987 --> 03:34:15.461
SAM: You're so mysterious

03:34:15.461 --> 03:34:18.630
ASHLEY: I have things that I need to do--

03:34:18.630 --> 03:34:20.347
SAM: Name one.

03:34:20.347 --> 03:34:23.389
TALIESIN: You know where we're headed.

03:34:23.389 --> 03:34:25.750
MATT: Blindspot.

03:34:25.750 --> 03:34:29.802
MARISHA: Poor Ashley, we make her come up with
excuses every time.

03:34:29.802 --> 03:34:41.437
ASHLEY: I have reasons, I can stay, I just need to
converse with somebody to see where my next step leads.

03:34:41.437 --> 03:34:44.387
MARISHA: You know you're not beholden to Gustav
anymore, right?

03:34:44.387 --> 03:34:47.105
ASHLEY: No, yes, no. It's not him.

03:34:47.105 --> 03:34:53.679
MARISHA: Is it Bo? The other Bo? Is it Desmond?

03:34:53.679 --> 03:34:55.194
ASHLEY: No.

03:34:55.194 --> 03:34:56.639
MARISHA: Is it Ornna?

03:34:56.639 --> 03:35:02.401
SAM: Please, Beau, let the detectives figure this
out. Is it Desmond?

03:35:02.401 --> 03:35:05.275
LAURA: Is it Ornna?

03:35:05.275 --> 03:35:07.989
SAM: It's Ornna, isn't it? It's Ornna, I knew it.

03:35:07.989 --> 03:35:09.516
LAURA: Will you hold this?

03:35:09.516 --> 03:35:13.618
SAM: Yes, of course. See? Another case cracked. It
was Ornna.

03:35:13.618 --> 03:35:24.103
LAURA: Before we leave, is there anywhere in town
that there would be a courier service where I could

03:35:24.103 --> 03:35:25.965
send a message?

03:35:25.965 --> 03:35:28.646
MATT: There are messenger services, yeah.

03:35:28.646 --> 03:35:30.165
LAURA: Can I go find one?

03:35:30.165 --> 03:35:36.114
MATT: Yeah, okay. For the purposes of brevity,
we'll say that you find a courier service that

03:35:36.114 --> 03:35:44.784
runs fast horseback all along the roads from the
Empire, and then with approval, outside of it,

03:35:44.784 --> 03:35:46.412
to the south and west.

03:35:46.412 --> 03:35:59.735
LAURA: I'm going to write a letter to my mother
that says, "Dear Mom, all of the money's gone. I

03:35:59.735 --> 03:36:06.869
"don't know what happened, but I am very broke and
I need more. Please help me. I am going to Zadash.

03:36:06.869 --> 03:36:15.540
"That's where you can send it. Just send it to the
inn that is the biggest one and I'll find it

03:36:15.540 --> 03:36:24.805
"there. Just address it to me. Your loving
daughter, Jester. Please, thank you, I need help,

03:36:24.805 --> 03:36:26.219
"thank you."

03:36:26.219 --> 03:36:36.853
MATT: All right. For delivery to Nicodranas, the
cost of the courier service will run you about

03:36:36.853 --> 03:36:38.508
five gold.

03:36:38.508 --> 03:36:44.101
LAURA: This is really fucking-- She better send
money, because this is eating into it.

03:36:44.101 --> 03:36:46.207
MATT: That's hundreds and hundreds of miles on
horseback.

03:36:46.207 --> 03:36:48.452
LAURA: Okay, I'll give the five gold for that.

03:36:48.452 --> 03:36:52.726
TALIESIN: It is such a different world.

03:36:52.726 --> 03:36:58.330
MATT: Yeah. Welcome to level... three, after
tonight.

03:36:58.330 --> 03:37:00.223
SAM: Oh! If we live.

03:37:00.223 --> 03:37:05.127
MARISHA: While we're stopping by the post office,
can I talk to the courier person?

03:37:05.127 --> 03:37:16.913
MATT: Sure. It's a young girl with short-ish
brushed hair, she's boyish and freckled, and a

03:37:16.913 --> 03:37:21.978
bit dirty in the edges of her chin, she's in the
process of loading up the packs on the horse, and

03:37:21.978 --> 03:37:25.926
she's wearing simple leather armor, and looks back
at you. "Can I help you?"

03:37:25.926 --> 03:37:30.391
MARISHA: Yeah, I was just wondering if you had any
incoming mail for the Baumbauchs? I said that I

03:37:30.391 --> 03:37:33.203
would pick it up on the way home, heading over
there.

03:37:33.203 --> 03:37:35.461
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:37:35.461 --> 03:37:37.907
TALIESIN: Wow.

03:37:37.907 --> 03:37:41.314
SAM: Mail fraud on the way out of town.

03:37:41.314 --> 03:37:47.205
MARISHA: That's good! 20. No. Deception? 19
total.

03:37:47.205 --> 03:37:57.096
MATT: "Let me check. Yeah, actually, we've got three
small parcels on the way to the Baumbauchs there."

03:37:57.096 --> 03:38:02.017
MARISHA: Thank you so much. He's going to be so
happy to not have to run this errand. Thank you,

03:38:02.017 --> 03:38:08.060
bye. Oh, sorry, here you go. I give her a gold.

03:38:08.060 --> 03:38:11.088
MATT: "That's very kind, thank you."

03:38:11.088 --> 03:38:12.584
MARISHA: Have a good day.

03:38:12.584 --> 03:38:16.072
MATT: Hops onto the horse and takes off
southward.

03:38:16.072 --> 03:38:18.212
TALIESIN: Mail fraud.

03:38:18.212 --> 03:38:20.524
MARISHA: Let's go.

03:38:20.524 --> 03:38:22.757
TALIESIN: That is actually the worst crime we've
committed today.

03:38:22.757 --> 03:38:26.772
MARISHA: You said how many? Three parcels?

03:38:26.772 --> 03:38:28.450
MATT: Three parcels.

03:38:28.450 --> 03:38:47.211
ASHLEY: When you get to Zadash, maybe send me a
note, or maybe I'll be there. I just have to do a

03:38:47.211 --> 03:38:48.695
couple things.

03:38:48.695 --> 03:38:53.080
LAURA: We'll send you a note on the way to Zadash.
Then maybe you can meet us there.

03:38:53.080 --> 03:38:55.466
ASHLEY: Okay. That sounds like a plan.

03:38:55.466 --> 03:39:02.492
TRAVIS: Do we have our fucking wagon ready?

03:39:02.492 --> 03:39:11.572
TALIESIN: Wagon's ready. I've even attempted to hide
some of the contraband and otherwise. I packed well.

03:39:11.572 --> 03:39:17.689
LIAM: While everyone is getting ready, I wait for
a moment when Fjord is on his own and everyone is

03:39:17.689 --> 03:39:34.256
busy, walk over. This group seems rough around the
edges, but you seem clever. Hopefully we can make

03:39:34.256 --> 03:39:36.048
this work.

03:39:36.048 --> 03:39:42.041
TRAVIS: I think we should be able to, yeah. I
mean, a little guidance goes a long way. You seem

03:39:42.041 --> 03:39:44.137
to be good at looking out for Nott.

03:39:44.137 --> 03:39:50.727
LIAM: I mean, full disclosure, I'm a little rough
around the edges, but you catch my drift.

03:39:50.727 --> 03:39:57.396
TRAVIS: I do. You can trust us. You're safe here.
I'm concerned with what happens with Jester and

03:39:57.396 --> 03:40:02.130
Beau. I think, amongst all of us, we should be
fine.

03:40:02.130 --> 03:40:06.210
LIAM: Let's make it work.

03:40:06.210 --> 03:40:10.037
TRAVIS: We'll make it work.

03:40:10.037 --> 03:40:20.895
SAM: Fjord, something in me says that, for some
reason, you should be the one who tells the horses

03:40:20.895 --> 03:40:22.427
and wagon to go.

03:40:22.427 --> 03:40:26.699
(laughter)

03:40:26.699 --> 03:40:30.686
SAM: It just seems-- you're the biggest, maybe?

03:40:30.686 --> 03:40:39.612
TRAVIS: That is mighty considerate of you, Nott.
Are you sure you don't want to take a crack at it?

03:40:39.612 --> 03:40:46.767
SAM: I could take a crack at it. The wagons be
hitched, hee-haw.

03:40:46.767 --> 03:40:52.951
TRAVIS: Use your diaphragm. Really get a yee-haw,
get in there.

03:40:52.951 --> 03:40:59.354
SAM: Saddle up your doggies, hee-haw.

03:40:59.354 --> 03:41:05.018
TRAVIS: One more time, on the count of three. One,
two, three. On three, I push his chest in.

03:41:05.018 --> 03:41:06.609
SAM: Yee-haw!

03:41:06.609 --> 03:41:19.232
MATT: All right. With that, her vocal expulsion is
majestic and sudden. Make an animal handling check

03:41:19.232 --> 03:41:20.738
with advantage, please.

03:41:20.738 --> 03:41:30.599
SAM: With advantage? Six. I'm still a scary
goblin.

03:41:30.599 --> 03:41:38.242
MATT: The sound that comes out is less of a
"Yee-haw," and more of a screech sound. The horse

03:41:38.242 --> 03:41:44.647
immediately rises up and goes into a very heavy
gallop, and the cart takes off ahead of you, and

03:41:44.647 --> 03:41:52.712
you all struggle to catch up for a bit. With that,
you guys quickly try and saunter up, heading

03:41:52.712 --> 03:42:00.621
northward along the road towards the direction of
Alfield, and eventually Zadash, as you head

03:42:00.621 --> 03:42:05.159
further into the Dwendalian Empire, and whatever
fate has in store for you the next leg of your

03:42:05.159 --> 03:42:10.123
journey. We'll stop tonight's session there.

03:42:10.123 --> 03:42:13.099
SAM: Ashley Johnson, ladies and gentlemen.

03:42:13.099 --> 03:42:14.147
LIAM: Yee-haw.

03:42:14.147 --> 03:42:15.780
ALL: Yee-haw.

03:42:15.780 --> 03:42:22.478
TRAVIS: Well, we committed felonies and mail
fraud. That's good.

03:42:22.478 --> 03:42:24.522
TALIESIN: Quite a few. Got into a bar fight.

03:42:24.522 --> 03:42:27.578
LAURA: We skipped town without paying our inn
fees.

03:42:27.578 --> 03:42:29.209
SAM: We bought drugs.

03:42:29.209 --> 03:42:33.740
TRAVIS: We bought a little bit of mold.

03:42:33.740 --> 03:42:38.047
MATT: You paid your inn fee.

03:42:38.047 --> 03:42:47.410
LAURA: We did pay on the way in. I did pay for a
few days when we got in. I guess that is probably enough.

03:42:47.410 --> 03:42:51.552
LIAM: Oh my gosh, and Sneaky McSneakerson over
here. Oh boy.

03:42:51.552 --> 03:42:55.235
SAM: Oh, yeah. Who knows what Marisha did while we
were out there?

03:42:55.235 --> 03:42:57.855
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to go back and not watch that
later.

03:42:57.855 --> 03:43:01.198
MARISHA: Like the three rules of Fight Club.

03:43:01.198 --> 03:43:04.115
MATT: You guys are all level three when you come
back next week.

03:43:04.115 --> 03:43:06.666
(cheering)

03:43:06.666 --> 03:43:10.327
TRAVIS: Oh god, we got to shop. We got to book
shop.

03:43:10.327 --> 03:43:12.236
LAURA: Oh man, this is fun.

03:43:12.236 --> 03:43:19.833
MATT: Yeah, thank you guys for sticking around for
a less intense, more character-driven episode,

03:43:19.833 --> 03:43:26.178
these early days of figuring each other out and
forming a fellowship. This is fun, I love it.

03:43:26.178 --> 03:43:27.528
LIAM: Bunch of assholes.

03:43:27.528 --> 03:43:28.520
MATT: I know.

03:43:28.520 --> 03:43:29.900
TALIESIN: Bunch of assholes!

03:43:29.900 --> 03:43:31.230
LIAM: That's the name.

03:43:31.230 --> 03:43:35.581
MATT: Thank you guys for watching. Thank you
again, Deven, for being an incredible artist, and

03:43:35.581 --> 03:43:40.183
an incredible mapmaker for working with me on
that. Her Twitter-- I should've had this prepared

03:43:40.183 --> 03:43:51.952
in advance! You can follow Deven on Twitter
@devenrue, Mistress of Maps. Her work is

03:43:51.952 --> 03:43:58.347
incredible. She has a Patreon, which I'm a patron
for, you should be too. It's her birthday, so say

03:43:58.347 --> 03:43:59.481
happy birthday to her.

03:43:59.481 --> 03:44:00.917
ALL: Happy Birthday!

03:44:00.917 --> 03:44:07.078
MATT: All right, guys, have a wonderful week.
Ashley, come back.

03:44:07.078 --> 03:44:10.720
ASHLEY: Hopefully soon, I never know. I'll try.

03:44:10.720 --> 03:44:12.296
LAURA: So glad you were here.

03:44:12.296 --> 03:44:18.414
MATT: If anybody from Blindspot is watching right
now, kill off her character. I mean, don't do

03:44:18.414 --> 03:44:20.120
that, but we want her back.

03:44:20.120 --> 03:44:23.852
ASHLEY: I don't think any of them are watching.

03:44:23.852 --> 03:44:29.885
MATT: It's fine. We just miss her a lot. We'll see
you guys back next week. Much love to you, much

03:44:29.885 --> 03:44:32.695
love to you, and is it Thursday yet?

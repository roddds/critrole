MATT: Hello everyone,

00:00:01.243 --> 00:00:02.970
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.360
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.220
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.000
ALL: (high-pitched and silly voices)
We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.472
MATT: The evolution is something.

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:15.313
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:15.313 --> 00:00:16.620
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.660
we have some announcements to get through,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.140
beginning with the first of our two sponsors,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.330
which is tonight NordVPN, which means,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.170
it says here on the sheet,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.520
"We have another technoriffic installment

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.710
"of 'Nord by Nordwest:

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.229
"'The Quest for the Ultra Codex Reloaded.'"

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.300
(laughter)

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.220
Which, apparently, is the title

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.080
that Sam has now named these segments, so we'll just...

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.940
You know what?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.210
Taliesin. Take it away, man.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.270
TALIESIN: Thank you, Matt.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.503
(laughter)

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:46.220
LIAM: Look at Marisha.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.860
TALIESIN: As everyone on the dark net remembers,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.210
blackwillow69@aol.com and KryptonicOverride

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.640
needed a level 12 master hacker

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.190
to get them out of the internet.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.470
And it turns out you're looking at one.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.580
I, FreezerBurn, spent 10 long years in nano-jail

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.315
for electro-crimes against webmanity.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.714
But now I'm hacking for friendship.

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:08.697
(laughter)

00:01:08.697 --> 00:01:12.180
You see, I'm an old-school hacker, really old school.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.180
My power glove is cranked up to Duck Hunt,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.970
but my secret weapon

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.720
is my mega abacus millennium edition,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.624
given to me by none other than Pharaoh Ramses III.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.968
(beads rattle)
Let's get jiggy with it.

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:26.850
(laughter)
(beads rattling rapidly)

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.040
One, two, three...

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.140
Damn it!

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.982
Looks like they're behind

00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:34.550
a plex-folded, Fortran flamewall!

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.495
Ha! Child's Play, part two.

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:40.160
Flip the floppy, unmax the headroom,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.680
shoot the C++, and Baloo the TaleSpin!

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.463
Ugh, no.

00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:49.450
Not even my cyber abacus can unjack them.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.358
This is a two-man job.

00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:55.950
ASHLEY: (cockney accent) Oi, did you say two-man job?

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.126
You-- (laughs)
(laughter)

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:02.501
You may've heard of me as the MadHatterson.

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:04.980
Sure, me hacks on TV were mad fictional,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.740
but I wrote every script!

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.830
Let's fuckin' rescue Laura!

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.821
TALIESIN: And Sam!
ASHLEY: What?

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:13.384
Oi, yeah, of course, Sam too.

00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:15.188
Come on, let's use everything we got!

00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:16.670
(beads rattling)
(laughter)

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.410
TALIESIN: I'm dropping code I learned in the Dark Ages!

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.620
ASHLEY: This binary sequence has plateaued on me COSTART!

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.520
TALIESIN: Gilgamesh itself invented the DDoS attack!

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.220
ASHLEY: The cube shall be...

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.936
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Gleamed!

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.330
LAURA and SAM: (gasping)
SAM: Did it work?

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.910
LAURA: We're back!
ASHLEY: Yes!

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.177
Everything is A-OK!

00:02:39.177 --> 00:02:40.330
SAM: No!

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.260
Everything's changed.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.010
There's a secret you all need to know,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.420
and I'll tell you,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.470
next time NordVPN sponsors our show.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.330
They are the highest-quality encryption

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.450
for your internet traffic

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.270
and to hide your IP and physical location,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.230
and it's the last chance to get their three-year deal

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.630
for $3.49 a month.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.790
Go to NordVPN.com/CriticalRole and use code "CRITICALROLE"

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.400
to get 70% off a three-year plan

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.950
and a extra month for free.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.710
Get going with secure, super-fast

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.110
NordLynx-powered VPN service now,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.500
and I'll tell you all

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.010
what happened in the internet next time.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.333
Matt, hack to you.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:18.970
SAM: Matt, hack to you.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.290
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MATT: (clearing throat)

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.850
Thank you, Sam and everybody. Wow.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.910
And especially Marisha,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.880
who was really the key player in that narrative there.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.573
MARISHA: I don't know why I had to be here.

00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:30.048
(laughter)

00:03:30.048 --> 00:03:31.731
SAM: You could've literally shown up to work

00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:32.939
15 minutes late.
LAURA: There's so much color

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.172
on that screen right now

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.790
between your hair and Ashley's jacket.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.780
LIAM: I encourage everybody to watch
that segment a second time

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.916
to watch Marisha's subtle facial journey

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:43.915
through it all.

00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:46.553
SAM: Oh, Ashley, that was amazing.
TALIESIN: That was fantastic.

00:03:46.553 --> 00:03:48.530
ASHLEY: I know, my accent, I really--

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.204
TRAVIS: You took us to another world.

00:03:50.204 --> 00:03:51.060
ASHLEY: -- for a long time.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.820
TRAVIS: We got New York in there somehow at one point.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.653
ASHLEY: Yes.
LIAM: Fusion.

00:03:54.653 --> 00:03:56.030
ASHLEY: I wanted to cover a lot of--

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.640
I come from everywhere.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.271
TRAVIS: Crikey! Australia.
TALIESIN: Hack the planet.

00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:02.358
ASHLEY: Hack the planet. Hack the--

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:03.260
MATT: And well done.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.990
Thank you, Ashley, thank you, Sam.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.142
Thank you, NordVPN.

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:08.630
Our second sponsor tonight is our good friend

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.070
since the beginning of Campaign Two,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.587
D&amp;D Beyond.
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

00:04:12.587 --> 00:04:13.800
MATT: So for those who aren't aware,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.990
D&amp;D Beyond has now added a digital dice-rolling feature

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.560
to their fantastic online elements there.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.220
It's integrated into the character sheet now,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.310
so if there's any rollable stat in the game,

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.460
you can go ahead and just click on it,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.060
and it will roll it for you,

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.320
add the modifiers and give you the roll that you need,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.770
which is awesome and super-convenient,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.390
especially if you're having to play games online

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.900
like everyone is, and having to roll dice,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.880
and that whole thing can be weird,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.830
and losing it and drop it and let the space...

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.710
Maybe it's just me in my office.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.920
But you can start your collection now of digital dice

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.690
with the new Archmage's Favor dice,

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.210
a digital set with unique animations

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.320
and sounds that pulse with unstable magic

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.550
and unleashes ancient arcane magic across your screen

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.320
with every natural 20.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.600
That sounds cool.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.690
Probably not dangerous at all.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.523
But check it out today at

00:04:57.523 --> 00:05:02.106
dndbeyond.link/CRArch,

00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:03.772
A-R-C-H.

00:05:03.772 --> 00:05:04.730
And thank you again, once again,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.210
for D&amp;D Beyond for sponsoring our show all this time.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.420
For our announcements,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.702
Laura, you've got some things to mention.

00:05:11.702 --> 00:05:15.292
LAURA: I've got a couple of things to talk about.

00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:18.822
Um...
(triumphant fanfare)

00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:19.810
(clamoring)

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.860
Take it off this super-cool hanger, hold on.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.377
(triumphant fanfare)
(laughter)

00:05:26.377 --> 00:05:29.668
It's our very first CR polo shirt!

00:05:29.668 --> 00:05:31.480
TRAVIS: Give it to me!

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.720
LAURA: For all those professional nerds out there

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.190
that need to have a collar.
TRAVIS: Give it.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.400
LAURA: Look at this!
SAM: Is there a lining in there?

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.250
LAURA: There's a cool--

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.110
It's, like, a upper lining thing.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.710
Just, you know, a little something something

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.140
that we added for fun.
(laughter)

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.340
MATT: A little secret just for you.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.400
LAURA: A little secret just for your little polo. Hold on.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.090
Oh! A little contrast lining!

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.049
SAM: Ooh!
LAURA: So yeah.

00:05:58.049 --> 00:05:59.320
This is in the store.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.370
This is in the store right now

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.326
in the US and the UK CritRole shops, da-da.

00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:06.962
(laughter)

00:06:06.962 --> 00:06:09.700
Okay, and then the second thing...

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.695
(laughter)

00:06:13.695 --> 00:06:14.720
LAURA: Then

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.553
the other thing

00:06:15.553 --> 00:06:18.433
that I wanted to talk about is this box.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.880
TRAVIS: Put out the flames.
LAURA: Inside of it--

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.630
TRAVIS: It's burning--
LAURA: (gasping)

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.145
SAM: Ooh, whoa.

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:26.413
LAURA: Oh!

00:06:26.413 --> 00:06:30.990
It's our Don't Forget to Love Each Other mug!

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.230
MARISHA: So cute!

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.675
LAURA: Right?

00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:35.480
So yeah, these are so wonderful,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.410
and these are now available in the US, UK,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.750
and the Australia Critical Role shops.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.160
It's got the same 11 flags

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.480
as our updated t-shirt that we recently released,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.760
and six dollars of every mug sold will be donated

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.740
to OutRight Action International.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.770
MARISHA: Yeah!
TRAVIS: That's wonderful.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.420
MARISHA: It's so cute.
TRAVIS: It's a good mug.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.820
It's a fair amount of coffee.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.170
LAURA: You know how I am about mugs,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.123
so I wanted to make sure this mug was awesome.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.600
MATT: Hell yeah. Thank you, Laura.
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.460
SAM: Good job, Laura.
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.980
MATT: And so I think with that, our announcements conclude,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.317
which means it's time for us to go ahead and jump into

00:07:14.317 --> 00:07:15.933
tonight's episode of--

00:07:15.933 --> 00:07:17.308
TRAVIS: Too early.
MARISHA: We don't have a plan!

00:07:17.308 --> 00:07:18.316
MATT: -- Critical Role.

00:07:18.316 --> 00:07:19.516
(cut off yelling)

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:22.348
(water bubbling)

00:07:22.348 --> 00:07:27.348
(thunder rumbling)

(laughter

00:08:59.092 --> 00:09:01.310
MATT: And welcome back.
TALIESIN: That works.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.589
LIAM: Delayed reaction on that.
MATT: So.

00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:05.849
Last we left off:

00:09:05.849 --> 00:09:08.922
The Mighty Nein, after arriving to the island of Rumblecusp

00:09:08.922 --> 00:09:12.012
to set up the coming Traveler Con, now naught

00:09:12.012 --> 00:09:14.791
but probably seven days away.

00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:17.007
You discovered that a culture of people

00:09:17.007 --> 00:09:18.389
had been living here for quite some time

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:19.812
before you arrived,

00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:23.554
worshiping this fire entity known as Vokodo,

00:09:23.554 --> 00:09:25.322
and an enchantment seemed to lay on the space

00:09:25.322 --> 00:09:27.073
that caused them to forget

00:09:27.073 --> 00:09:28.580
everything about their past lives

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.356
and live here happily amongst their new society here

00:09:31.356 --> 00:09:32.863
in the village of Vo.

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:34.655
With the aid of one such druid

00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:36.679
as their spiritual guardian, named Viridian,

00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:38.262
you went and spoke with this fire god

00:09:38.262 --> 00:09:39.672
who seems a little less godlike

00:09:39.672 --> 00:09:43.802
and a little more like strange, greedy entity

00:09:43.802 --> 00:09:46.639
that rules those on the island.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:49.947
You freed the mind, long clouded, of this druid

00:09:49.947 --> 00:09:52.255
and discovered her name is actually Vilya,

00:09:52.255 --> 00:09:54.215
apparently a druid from Tal'Dorei,

00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:55.788
and you began to figure out

00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:58.604
how best to possibly free the island

00:09:58.604 --> 00:10:00.704
of whatever this creature's influence is

00:10:00.704 --> 00:10:04.418
in preparation for the coming hordes of Traveler followers

00:10:04.418 --> 00:10:07.063
that are making their way.

00:10:07.063 --> 00:10:11.080
You then traveled across to the Heaven Falls,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.380
an upward shooting waterfall

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.910
on the eastern side of the island,

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.090
which seemed to contain behind it an illusory cliff-face,

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.730
a bunch of ships that had been long hoarded away,

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.540
apparently the vessels that carried

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.720
many of the people that live on the island here originally

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.300
and then were kept from sight

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.300
to prevent them from remembering where they came from

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.440
and how to leave.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.620
You nearly lost Caduceus, who was drawn in

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.400
by some sort of magical enchantment

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.810
at the tunnels that lead to Vokodo's lair, and upon fleeing,

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.060
you made your way northward to the strange Ruins,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.990
a sliver, one of many, of strange segments

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.180
of either this world or other nearby dimensions

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.780
that came here, it seems,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.778
when Vokodo fled here from the Astral Sea for some reason.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.460
Unfortunately, you destroyed the spirits

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.560
that remained at the Ruin,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.430
as opposed to seeking possible an alliance with them,

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.300
but in doing so,

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.770
also removed a dangerous aspect of the island

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.170
that prevented people from going there,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.150
so not all is lost.
(laughter)

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.650
Gathering yourselves and beginning your trek backward

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:20.650
past towards the actual volcano of Rumblecusp

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.620
later in the afternoon,

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.495
you begin to plot

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:29.210
whatever your next stage of engagement

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.470
with the dangers of this island may be.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.600
So as you return, you guys have begun making your trek back

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.080
from the northern side of the island from the Ruin,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.140
at which case Vilya does mention,

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.807
as it begins to grow a little more dangerous.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.093
"It's interesting.

00:11:48.093 --> 00:11:50.720
"Since you've cleared my mind,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.300
"I'm still kind of finding myself,

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.530
"but I feel I might be able

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.950
"to get us somewhere on the island rather quickly,

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.267
"if I've been there."

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.310
TRAVIS: How do you mean?

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.760
MATT: "Uh, getting to the Ruins,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.400
"or places that I have not actually been

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.010
"or seen myself before,

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.600
"I have to travel the challenging way,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.650
"but if I know of a tree that I've seen

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.650
"or been around previously--"
LAURA: (gasping)

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.120
MATT: "I may be able to bring us there,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.370
"if we have a tree to enter."
SAM: If we have a tree?

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.330
Your village is lousy with trees.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.240
You've got nothing but trees.
MATT: "Right.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.490
"Would you like to go back to the village?

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.650
"Did you want to make your way to the Heaven Falls again?

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.970
"Did you want to make your way to Vokodo's lair?"

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.312
LAURA: If we can get to the village quickly,

00:12:33.312 --> 00:12:37.490
then we could maybe try to free the mind of somebody else

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.540
and they could help us.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.600
TRAVIS: Terra, the hunting leader?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.610
TALIESIN: Kind of tapped out at this point.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.380
LAURA: Oh. Am I, too?

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.760
Maybe.
ASHLEY: What time is it?

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.110
SAM: Afternoon?
MATT: It's afternoon,

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.480
after you guys have traveled out to the--

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.990
LAURA: I've got a 6th-level left.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.500
TRAVIS: Just to be clear, it's like a teleportation?

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.110
We just step in a circle like our friend can do, or--?

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.980
MATT: "It's a little different."

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.324
TRAVIS: Oh. A tree.
LIAM: How does the tree factor into it?

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.420
Is it like a component

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.520
for what you would do, or--?

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.454
MATT: "The tree becomes the door."

00:13:10.454 --> 00:13:13.180
TALIESIN: Huh.
TRAVIS: The tree becomes the door.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.600
MATT: "I understand that you may ascribe to

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.570
"the more esoteric arcane spell constructs.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.670
"I, myself, tend to lean on nature and the elements

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.910
"to draw the intent, so."

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:28.743
TALIESIN: Hm.

00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:30.549
MATT: "Just trust me."

00:13:30.549 --> 00:13:31.930
LIAM: All right.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.910
I would love to see a tree turn into a door.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.010
LAURA: Me, too.
TALIESIN: I mean,

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.258
most doors used to be trees.

00:13:37.258 --> 00:13:40.380
LIAM: Yeah, but that's a slower process.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.240
LAURA: Some doors are made of stone.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.623
TALIESIN: That's true. That does happen.
LAURA: Some doors are made of iron.

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:46.011
TRAVIS: I forget.

00:13:46.011 --> 00:13:48.970
Are we trying to drive to Vokodo before we rest?

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.390
No. We're doing one more night, right?

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.190
LAURA: Yeah, we have to, because if we take a rest tonight,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.340
then we can all have a nice fancy feast.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.890
TRAVIS: We could try and wait in the village.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.610
We could try to convince Terra,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.233
but also, Terra may resist and

00:14:04.233 --> 00:14:05.968
try to stop us.

00:14:05.968 --> 00:14:08.850
SAM: Or rouse the village against us.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.275
TRAVIS: Right.
TALIESIN: Hmm.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.690
SAM: Once we do, with or without Terra,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.630
do we have a plan after that?

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.320
Were we going to go in from the front and the back

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.730
at the same time or something?

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.390
Was that a plan?

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.380
TALIESIN: We thought that there was no sneaking up.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:31.350
I think the idea's to go in just as we were,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.470
and see if the element of surprise

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.820
could just be our intentions.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.850
LAURA: I mean, we can always try again tomorrow

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.283
to see if our divine...

00:14:41.283 --> 00:14:43.350
people can help us.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.050
SAM: You're so religious.
LAURA: You know.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.883
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, we're going to try

00:14:46.883 --> 00:14:48.190
and get him out of his--
TALIESIN: I'm tapped for that.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.765
LAURA: Yeah, but tomorrow.

00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:52.020
TALIESIN: One week.
LAURA: Oh, it worked!

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.710
TRAVIS: Should we try and draw him out from his hot springs

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.780
underneath the volcano?

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.760
LIAM: And what would be something that would tempt him

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.070
out of his cubby hole?

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.940
LAURA: I've been thinking about this, you guys.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.040
TRAVIS: You were what?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.940
LAURA: Well, what if...

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.528
You know how he has all those ships?

00:15:11.528 --> 00:15:12.453
SAM: Mm-hmm?

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:15.880
LAURA: Well, when I was talking to the dragon turtle,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.130
he said he takes what he wants

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.440
and he likes to have all of his stuff.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.920
He thinks he has the most stuff.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.840
So what if I were to just send him a little message

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.910
and tell him that, you know,

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.480
maybe somebody else out there has more stuff,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.360
and he's not as cool as he thought he was.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.550
SAM: That's brilliant.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.020
SAM: That's brilliant.
TRAVIS: (clearing throat)

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.610
SAM: <i>I</i> remember, but for those who don't,

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.310
the access to the shipyard, the hidden shipyard,

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.455
is it accessible by the ocean?

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:55.288
It has to be, right?

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.603
How do the ships get there?
MATT: It is, yes.

00:15:56.603 --> 00:15:57.830
SAM: It is.
MARISHA: It is?

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.630
TRAVIS: It is, but the tunnel through,

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.000
in that particular tunnel, doesn't quite seem...

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.880
LAURA: Yeah, but he's a fucking dragon turtle.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.230
I mean, I'm sure he could

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.113
bust a hole if he wanted to.

00:16:08.113 --> 00:16:10.610
Besides the fact, if he went into the area

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.740
that has all the ships and he was like,

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.380
"Fuck these ships, these should be my ships!"

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.000
And was like, "Fuck you!"

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.690
And then he destroys everything,

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.090
don't you think Vokodo would come out

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.300
and be like, "What the shit?!"

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.090
And he would try to attack the thing that was attacking him?

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.220
And then he would be out,

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.010
and then we could all attack him there too,

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.560
and then we would be fighting with the dragon turtle,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.720
and then he would be like, "Oh my gosh, I love you guys,"

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.430
and he would give us a ride home.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.470
SAM: This is a rock-solid plan.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.020
I'm in, yes, correct.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.740
TRAVIS: The evolution of that idea was staggering.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.573
I like how it ended

00:16:40.573 --> 00:16:43.020
with us riding the dragon turtle into the sunset.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.640
LIAM: Yeah, he would also have to
negotiate through a shipyard

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.910
in an underground cavern

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.910
and then go through tunnels,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.630
which were not that large.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.760
We had a hard time getting Caduceus out of them.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.593
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's correct.

00:16:54.593 --> 00:16:56.010
LIAM: So that was a bit of a tight fit, and--

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.490
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm sure Vokodo

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:58.860
has a way to get out of his lair.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.140
TRAVIS: Isn't it a maze under there?

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.440
Maybe there are more tunnels

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.110
we didn't see, larger ones.
LAURA: There's got to be something.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.410
TRAVIS: Like, how did he get in there?

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.185
LAURA: Exactly! He has to have a way in and out.

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:07.310
SAM: We don't need the dragon turtle

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.360
to get to Vokodo.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.490
We just need the dragon turtle to get to the ship.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.323
TRAVIS: What would it cost?

00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:15.430
What would it cost for you to execute this batshit plan?

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.090
LAURA: A spell.

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.000
TRAVIS: A big one?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.031
LAURA: No, it's just my Sending spell.
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:17:21.031 --> 00:17:23.551
LAURA: I have so many messages I can send him right now.
TRAVIS: We should totally do that.

00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:25.330
MARISHA: I mean, it's worth a shot.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:26.580
If it doesn't work, then

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.150
we're no further away from our original plan.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.410
LIAM: -- of walking in and--

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.890
TRAVIS: Yeah. We're not much
worse off if nothing happens.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.370
MARISHA: And it goes with that

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.500
playing his weakness against each other.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.300
He's super fucking greedy.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.300
TRAVIS: How long--

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.178
Oh, we don't know where the dragon turtle is, do we?

00:17:42.178 --> 00:17:45.025
LAURA: Mm-mmm, but he did recently destroy our ship,

00:17:45.025 --> 00:17:46.853
within the last day or so, so he's close.

00:17:46.853 --> 00:17:49.280
SAM: Yeah, he's within a day or two's journey.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.171
TRAVIS: Okay. Well, that's fucking--

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:54.660
MARISHA: I'm trying to think if there are any other holes

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.901
we're not thinking of.

00:17:55.901 --> 00:17:56.970
SAM: Oh, of course there are,

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.795
but you know.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.810
Should we try and steal a ship

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.070
and squirrel one away for ourselves?

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.084
TRAVIS: It would be nice to keep one on the side.

00:18:07.084 --> 00:18:08.820
MARISHA: Before they fight and destroy them all.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.911
LAURA: But it's not like we couldn't

00:18:09.911 --> 00:18:12.444
get off of the island, right, Vilya?

00:18:13.418 --> 00:18:17.500
MATT: "I mean, there are ways to leave the island, yes."

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.200
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, you have trees that you know of, right?

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.010
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: On the island.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.280
LAURA: But you have trees that you remember

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.850
from before the island.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.550
MATT: "I know many trees across Exandria

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.216
"from my travels."
LAURA: Yeah! So we could hop into any tree!

00:18:28.216 --> 00:18:29.830
TRAVIS: Oh, you can go to any tree you've ever known?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.422
MATT: "That I've visited, yes."

00:18:31.422 --> 00:18:33.555
TRAVIS: Well, fuck! That's way different.

00:18:33.555 --> 00:18:34.780
MATT: "But you also mentioned

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.190
"that you're able to teleport as well, correct?"

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.210
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, although I can only
bring through so many people.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.833
It does not last very long. I'm not sure what--

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.250
I mean, there's all the people in Vo.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.090
LAURA: Do you have a limited amount of people

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.180
that you can bring through a tree?

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.860
MATT: "It's a very short time that it exists."

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.918
TRAVIS: How short?

00:18:56.918 --> 00:18:58.668
MATT: "Six seconds."

00:18:58.668 --> 00:19:00.130
TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.730
SAM: But that's how long Caleb's spell lasts,

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.950
and we've managed.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.980
LIAM: I'm probably more limited.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.490
There's only a small handful of places

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.460
where I could bring people.
MATT: "True.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.430
"Though I would say, just as a point of reference,

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.710
"for a lot of these people who live here in the village,

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:21.010
"if we were to free them of Vokodo's influence,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.530
"there's a good chance that many of these ships

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.813
"are their livelihood.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.700
"So even if we were to take them away from the island--

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.600
"and I can't say this,

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.280
"because I don't know what their histories are--

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.810
"that's a lot of money that we're destroying

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.135
"that these people may have worked for in their life,

00:19:39.135 --> 00:19:41.200
"and it might be all that remains with them."

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.600
TRAVIS: Yes, but there's life and then there are things.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.433
MATT: "That's true."

00:19:46.433 --> 00:19:47.430
MARISHA: If they've been gone for that long,

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.630
they're presumed dead.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.534
SAM: Life doesn't need things to live.

00:19:51.534 --> 00:19:52.856
(laughter)

00:19:52.856 --> 00:19:54.648
TALIESIN: It can be perfectly content without it.

00:19:54.648 --> 00:19:56.539
(laughter)

00:19:56.539 --> 00:20:00.820
TRAVIS: I couldn't finish it.
(laughter)

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.020
LAURA: I mean, do you think there's a chance

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.420
that anybody that, you know, has been here this long,

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.745
they may just want to stay?

00:20:08.745 --> 00:20:09.980
MATT: "I don't know.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.190
"It's possible."
LAURA: People have babies here!

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.030
MATT: "There's probably some who have only known their life

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:16.863
"on this island.

00:20:16.863 --> 00:20:19.010
"We have children who were born here."

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.210
LIAM: Oh.
MARISHA: Even still.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.800
MATT: "It's complicated."
MARISHA: Releasing them from Vokodo

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.100
would at least give them their own free will

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.890
to decide what to do.
MATT: "Exactly."

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.690
LAURA: Plus, they don't know that those ships are okay.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.740
For all they know, Vokodo destroyed them.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.060
MATT: "The choice is yours.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.180
"I'm following your lead."

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.013
TRAVIS: Sure, sure.

00:20:35.013 --> 00:20:35.950
There are plenty of trees.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.464
I mean, how hard is it to chop down a tree and make a ship?

00:20:39.464 --> 00:20:40.997
Pretty hard.

00:20:40.997 --> 00:20:42.430
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.055
TALIESIN: I genuinely have no idea.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.570
LAURA: Besides, you know, we don't even know

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.190
if this is going to work.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.570
SAM: Yeah, your Sending relationship

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.090
with Mr. Turtle Man was iffy, if I recall, right?

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.100
LAURA: No, he really liked me a lot.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:20:59.933
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh!

00:20:59.933 --> 00:21:02.050
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. We had really good conversations.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.076
SAM: Oh.

00:21:03.076 --> 00:21:05.740
TRAVIS: How many times have you communicated?

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.840
LAURA: Pretty much, like,--

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.631
I just talked to him, like, 10 minutes ago,

00:21:09.631 --> 00:21:11.690
and he was like, "Oh, hey Jester, what's going on?"

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.115
LIAM: What is his name?

00:21:13.115 --> 00:21:14.588
LAURA: Dragon turtle.

00:21:14.588 --> 00:21:17.432
MARISHA: (laughs)
LIAM: Okay.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:19.923
MARISHA: Yasha.

00:21:19.923 --> 00:21:20.780
LIAM: D Turtle.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.870
MARISHA: You've been very quiet.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:22.770
What do you think?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.390
ASHLEY: I mean, we don't quite have a plan yet to fight him,

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.510
so we might as well try this.

00:21:31.933 --> 00:21:34.030
If we can get somebody else to fight him,

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.590
and I'm sure when he dies,

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.070
everybody will start to remember things.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.330
TRAVIS: The dragon turtle or Vokodo?

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.780
ASHLEY: Vokodo.
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. Of course.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.370
TALIESIN: Will we have to fight the dragon turtle?

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.460
MARISHA: That's actually a good point.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.930
ASHLEY: We'd have to fight the dragon turtle.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.440
MARISHA: Or we could have to fight both.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.030
LAURA: The dragon turtle will probably be--

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.830
Whichever one made it out would be weakened.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.172
Right?
TRAVIS: Weekend?

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.840
LAURA: In the weakened state?
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.110
LIAM: Well, what about this?

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.180
Building on your idea, Jester,

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.337
what if you send your message to your dragon turtle?

00:22:10.206 --> 00:22:12.750
What if we holed up into the shipyard

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.430
and kept ourselves hidden,

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.920
and we kick off a kaiju battle there,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.911
and while Vokodo is occupied with your friend, D Turtle--

00:22:25.294 --> 00:22:26.980
LIAM: We attempt to--

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.970
You, and you, and I attempt to
send him away while he's busy,

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:32.850
rather than walking in

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.260
and having all of his attention and ire directed at us.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.618
If it works. Maybe it won't.
LAURA: If it works.

00:22:37.618 --> 00:22:39.410
LIAM: But if it works,

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.880
we don't let your friend handle it all.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.260
We lie in wait, hidden, and then from the peanut gallery,

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.770
we attempt to banish him away.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.447
MARISHA: And you're talking about Guacamole?

00:22:50.447 --> 00:22:51.513
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yes.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:22:51.513 --> 00:22:53.138
LAURA: And if it doesn't work

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:56.263
then we just go in all on our own

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:01.180
and try to fight a giant, almost godlike creature.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.360
ASHLEY: Wait, but what do we do with the dragon turtle

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.447
once Guacamole maybe is gone?

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.293
LAURA: Wait, what?

00:23:10.293 --> 00:23:12.110
ASHLEY: What do we do with the dragon turtle then?

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.160
LAURA: Well, then, he'll have some ships

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.193
and he'll probably--

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:16.900
TRAVIS: Lots of treasure, as well,

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.220
on the back of Vokodo.
ASHLEY: He'll just stay in there.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.910
TRAVIS: Well, or take it to his underwater lair.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.550
I think they drag ships down,

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.630
and then take it to wherever--

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.690
MARISHA: You're sure he won't
still have a personal vendetta?

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.020
He's mainly just here for the ships,

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:35.480
and not the murder side of it, right?

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.100
SAM: We will have done him a great favor, though.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.310
LAURA: I mean, he'll get so much treasure from it.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.660
SAM: Also, I don't know anything,

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.350
but I'm going to confidently say

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.870
that he'll probably only take out one or two of the ships.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.310
There's lots.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.143
TALIESIN: I don't know.

00:23:51.143 --> 00:23:53.850
Transmutation tends to leave a sour taste.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.070
People can really hold that grudge.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.980
TRAVIS: Wait a minute.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.410
Can one of you grow or shrink things?

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.430
LIAM: Yeah.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.980
TRAVIS: Like, if the dragon turtle's a huge nuisance

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.170
and it comes into the cave,

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.560
can we (whooshing)

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.800
shrink him down and go through the tunnel and then (pop)?

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.560
LAURA: We polymorphed him before.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.140
SAM: Why does he need to go down the tunnel?

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.670
To get him to Vokodo?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.150
SAM: Why does he need to go to Vokodo?

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.370
MARISHA: If Vokodo doesn't come out to fight him.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.240
SAM: We're trying to get Vokodo to come to him, I thought.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.690
TRAVIS: Oh, well, yeah.
LAURA: That's the goal.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.330
But if he doesn't...

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.610
MARISHA: And that means we're hoping

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.380
he starts destroying a lot of ships,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.890
because that would ideally lure out Vokodo.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.270
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Do we know,

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.640
in our interactions with D Turtle,

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.110
did he connect with one of us?

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.560
Like, see one of our eyes and know hatred?

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.150
Does he have an enemy among us?

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:46.340
MARISHA: We threw Jester and Caduceus and Caleb overboard

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.810
and had them water-ski behind the ship.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.880
LAURA: And we turned him into a little--

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.020
MARISHA: Turned him into a slug.
SAM: But do you think

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.780
he clocked one of you?

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.740
LAURA: Well, I've been talking to him, so, you know.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.370
SAM: But you could be the, like,

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.203
"Hey, I'm on the ship.

00:24:58.203 --> 00:25:00.370
"Come destroy this one."
LAURA: Hey, who's over here!

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.253
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.550
You know, it depends on how we want to play it.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.400
I can try to antagonize him to make him come here.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.557
I can try to be nice to him to make him come here.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.493
TRAVIS: I had another idea.

00:25:13.493 --> 00:25:14.910
I don't think it's as good.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.820
If he was fleeing from the Astral Plane, right?

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.470
Which is where the astral dreadnought was from?

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.550
Is there a chance that maybe using Major Image

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.370
to conjure an astral dreadnought

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.130
outside the volcano and have it be like,

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.910
"Vokodo, I'm here to kill you!"

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.640
Would make him run?

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.180
SAM: Can you do that?
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.480
SAM: How big can your image be?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.670
TRAVIS: Any creature that's big as fuck, it says.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.771
Those are the words.

00:25:40.771 --> 00:25:42.270
(laughter)

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.990
MATT: The official ruling.
TRAVIS: "Visible phenomenon

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.030
"that is no larger than a 20-foot cube," so...

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.010
SAM: 20-foot cube?
TRAVIS: Pretty big.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:49.400
SAM: How big was the astral dreadnought?

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.460
LAURA: Was it 20 feet?

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.910
MATT: It was a little larger than that,

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.370
but you could make a slightly runtish--

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:55.830
MARISHA: Ooh, we could use forced perspective.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.590
If you put him far enough on the horizon--

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.700
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
MARISHA: You know?

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.980
And use one of the ships

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.532
in the foreground.
TRAVIS: Astral dreadnought lite.

00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:04.850
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah!

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:05.850
TRAVIS: I don't know.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.510
MARISHA: They did it on Lord of the Rings. It worked.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.960
LAURA: Yeah, you could totally do that.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.990
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Potentially.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.720
But a creature who has little trouble

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.030
getting into the minds of so many people,

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.277
you'd have to question whether it would be easy to--

00:26:16.277 --> 00:26:18.710
TRAVIS: Good call. That's fair.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.320
MARISHA: I like the D Turtle idea.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.320
ASHLEY: Yeah. I feel like it doesn't hurt to try.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.950
TRAVIS: DT?
MARISHA: Yeah, DT.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.630
LAURA: Should I send a message?
SAM: What could it hurt

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.700
to try to lure a vicious turtle--

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.040
ASHLEY: I think it's a fantastic idea.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.320
SAM: Yeah, what could go wrong?
ASHLEY: Yeah. What could go wrong?

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.790
TRAVIS: He'll thank us for all of the free--

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:39.680
They're intelligent.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.330
They strike deals with sailors sometimes.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.500
If there is gold--
SAM: They do?

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.700
TRAVIS: Yeah!
SAM: How do you know this?

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.940
TRAVIS: It's all part of the lore!

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.092
I mean, there's one guarding Darktow.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.440
LAURA: That's true.
TRAVIS: That's right, yeah.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.546
There's a percentage, a rev share,

00:26:56.546 --> 00:26:58.450
that goes to the DT.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.320
So maybe if we say: Hey!

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.140
This son of a bitch has got all your loot!

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.266
SAM: Fjord, are you all right?
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm okay.

00:27:04.266 --> 00:27:07.334
(laughter)

00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:08.757
ASHLEY: You're saying so many words today.

00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:12.250
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could say, like,
"Hey, come get all the gold!"

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.044
LIAM: Your accent work never disappoints.

00:27:14.044 --> 00:27:15.309
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:27:15.309 --> 00:27:16.920
Nothing but not consistent.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.472
TALIESIN: Maybe a split. Partners.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:22.690
MARISHA: Wait.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.060
LAURA: A split?
SAM: Go into a partnership.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.790
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Like 50/50 (British accent) gold?

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.630
Whoa.
(laughter)

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.463
LAURA: Oh, no!

00:27:29.463 --> 00:27:33.048
What's happening right now?
(laughter)

00:27:33.048 --> 00:27:34.160
SAM: Technically, technically!
LAURA: Technically.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.350
TRAVIS: Is the oxygen turned down in here?

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.423
MATT: No!

00:27:37.423 --> 00:27:38.772
ASHLEY: No, I think I made the table go cold.

00:27:38.772 --> 00:27:39.789
LAURA: Oh, god!

00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:41.760
(laughter)

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.750
TRAVIS: NordVPN, annihilating accents.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.750
ASHLEY: Nord by Nordwest.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.930
Okay, so should I give this a go, then?

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.470
SAM: The only thing that we need to decide--

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.550
The answer is yes, but--

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.660
LAURA: Okay!
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm?

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.960
SAM: The only thing we need to decide is,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.840
are we going to approach Terra at the village first?

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.800
Or should we put this plan in motion first

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.490
because it'll take him some travel time?

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.130
LIAM: We don't know how long it will take

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:09.120
for D Turtle to arrive, so perhaps we want to be rested

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.123
and prepared and on location.

00:28:11.123 --> 00:28:13.120
ASHLEY: Wait, did he take out our ship?
LAURA: In case he shows up

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.080
right away?
TALIESIN: He did.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.500
ASHLEY: So he might be close.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.850
LIAM: Maybe it'd take him a couple of hours,

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:17.800
or half a day or a day?

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.633
I have no idea where--

00:28:18.633 --> 00:28:20.020
LAURA: Well then, maybe I should send a message

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.620
early in the morning, or I should send a message

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.930
right before we go to sleep, or like--?

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:23.870
SAM: I feel like you should do it now,

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.060
at least to gauge where is he?

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.970
LIAM: What if he tears into there when we are not there?

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.280
SAM: Well, just to gauge.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.100
Like, she could say, "Hey, remember me?"

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.780
TRAVIS: "How far are you?"
SAM: "How far away are you?

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.290
"You interested in some treasure?"

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.810
LIAM: Or you have a lead on treasure

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.691
and will tell more.

00:28:42.691 --> 00:28:44.050
LAURA: I feel like it's going to work better

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.480
if I'm not sending multiple messages

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.630
going, "Hey, guess what?"

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.711
TRAVIS: I thought you said you talk to him all the time.

00:28:50.711 --> 00:28:52.640
LAURA: (spluttering) I do.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.470
But about other things, you know.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.130
So this would be, like--

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.070
He would probably see--

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.100
I don't really talk to him that much.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.590
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.423
Huh.

00:29:05.423 --> 00:29:07.750
One thing against talking to Terra,

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.300
we're going to run out of components soon

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.396
in order to do Greater Restorations, right?

00:29:11.396 --> 00:29:13.770
MARISHA: I feel like Terra's kind of a wild card.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.990
We don't know how she's going to respond or act.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.823
I don't know.

00:29:17.823 --> 00:29:22.691
I say we stay here, see what D Timberlake wants.

00:29:22.691 --> 00:29:24.600
LAURA: What? We go!

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.317
We get Terra. We be like--

00:29:27.317 --> 00:29:28.600
Because it'd be like you, Vilya, right?

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.760
Where you were like, "Don't touch me!"

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.082
And then as soon as we did, you were like, "Oh, hey."

00:29:32.082 --> 00:29:33.890
SAM: (laughs)

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.360
MATT: "Do I sound like that?"

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.200
LAURA: Well, sometimes.
MATT: "Okay, all right.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.423
"Sorry. Just a moment there.

00:29:39.423 --> 00:29:40.400
"It could be.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.335
"I don't know Terra outside of the village."

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.000
TRAVIS: Who was here first, you or her?

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.518
MATT: "Terra came after.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:51.523
"But...

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:57.300
"what worries me, and something to be aware of

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.120
"even if we succeed at all this--"

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.399
TRAVIS: This amazing plan?
MATT: "This amazing plan."

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:04.290
(laughter)

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.540
"Everyone in the village works together well

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.840
"because they've known nothing but the village.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.320
"We don't know who these people were

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.020
"before they found their way here."

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.250
MARISHA: Exactly.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.600
MATT: "And we don't know who
they're going to become when freed."

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.420
TRAVIS: Jesus, that's ominous.
SAM: So we could switch Terra

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.440
and find out that Terra's a total d-bag.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.340
MATT: "Or could be an amazing ally.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.560
"I don't know, I'm just saying,

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.870
"my concern, having been through this process,

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.290
"is I do not know who these people are

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.700
"beyond their persona here at the village."

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.540
LIAM: Yeah, and on a side note, there could be

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.020
some very awkward conversations

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.470
between the people who have had children

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:43.870
since arriving here.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.290
Like, what if they have families outside of the village?

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.127
LIAM: Ding, ding.

00:30:47.127 --> 00:30:48.343
TRAVIS: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:30:48.343 --> 00:30:50.318
MATT: "Well, that's going to have to

00:30:50.318 --> 00:30:51.700
"come to a head regardless,

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.810
"if we succeed.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.080
"It's just deciding if you want

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.190
"to try and recruit aid from others.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:03.074
"One, ensure how many of your components

00:31:03.074 --> 00:31:05.091
"you still have to be able to do that.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.313
"Because that's one

00:31:07.313 --> 00:31:10.030
"taking away from a night or two's rest for us,

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.498
"and we don't know what we're going to get."

00:31:12.498 --> 00:31:13.331
LAURA: (huffing)

00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:14.770
MARISHA: Feels like too much of a risk.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.490
TALIESIN: It's a big risk.
LAURA: All right.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:18.380
MARISHA: For a little bit of additional aid.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.010
LAURA: Let's just send that message to him.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.385
SAM: To the D Turtle?

00:31:22.385 --> 00:31:24.469
LAURA: No, to Vokodo. Yes, to the D Turtle.

00:31:24.469 --> 00:31:25.310
SAM: Oh, thank you, yes.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.120
Sure, yeah, let's do it.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.580
Today?
TALIESIN: It's a wild card.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.131
TRAVIS: It was your idea, go for it.

00:31:30.131 --> 00:31:31.930
LAURA: (squealing)

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.463
SAM: Do you need to rehearse?

00:31:33.463 --> 00:31:34.296
LAURA: Okay.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.380
Hey, dragon turtle...

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.230
I think I got it.
SAM: (laughs)

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.180
MARISHA: Great rehearsal.
SAM: Good run-through.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.781
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Shot through rehearsal.

00:31:46.781 --> 00:31:48.497
(laughter)

00:31:48.497 --> 00:31:50.172
TALIESIN: Felt that, felt true.

00:31:50.172 --> 00:31:51.638
LIAM: I thought we were shooting the rehearsal.

00:31:51.638 --> 00:31:52.610
(laughter)

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.330
MATT: Vilya nods and tilts her head in the way

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.610
that a dog that hears a strange sound does, like, "Hmm."

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:01.210
LAURA: We got this.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.440
You know what, this is kind of important.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.819
Maybe I shouldn't just wing it.

00:32:03.819 --> 00:32:04.652
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:32:04.652 --> 00:32:06.090
Which tactic do you want to go with?

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.880
LAURA: I don't know which kind of tactic I want to use!

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.300
Do I want to use a tactic where I'm like,

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.660
"I just found a whole bunch of ships!

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.610
"Do you want them?"

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:16.030
Or do I use the tactic like, "Hey.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.680
"I thought you were a badass,

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.190
"and there's this other guy here

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.690
"that's got all of these ships.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.550
"What the fuck?"
TRAVIS: Dragons are greedy

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.640
and egotistical, right?

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.760
So we should appeal to that side of it.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.710
So, like--
MARISHA: So, poke the turtle.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.420
Number two!
LAURA: Poke the turtle.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.253
LIAM: Oh, boy.

00:32:32.253 --> 00:32:33.570
If I may.
LAURA: Yeah?

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.480
LIAM: Traveler be with us. Go ahead.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.770
LAURA: Okay. (inhales)

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.790
Traveler. Be with us.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.220
Okay. I'm going to cast Sending.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.353
Get ready to count.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.370
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:48.203
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: You got this.

00:32:48.203 --> 00:32:49.280
TRAVIS: I'm never very good at counting.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.615
LAURA: I cast Sending.
MATT: All right.

00:32:51.615 --> 00:32:54.530
TRAVIS: I really should have a stenographer.
LIAM: Okay, it's for realsies now.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.331
LAURA: Hey, it's me!

00:32:59.471 --> 00:33:01.063
You destroyed our ship,

00:33:02.896 --> 00:33:04.413
but don't worry about it.

00:33:04.413 --> 00:33:05.433
SAM: (laughs)

00:33:05.433 --> 00:33:09.142
LAURA: Because we know a guy who's got, like,

00:33:09.142 --> 00:33:11.166
a hundred ships here.

00:33:13.465 --> 00:33:17.480
I thought you...

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.313
were--

00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:23.590
SAM: Is that it, really?
LAURA: I'm going to cast another one.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.423
SAM: Okay. (laughs)

00:33:24.423 --> 00:33:26.120
MATT: How quickly after?
LAURA: Immediately!

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.590
MATT: Okay.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.679
LAURA: -- supposed to be great and stuff.

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:34.295
How come this guy has so many more ships than you?

00:33:34.295 --> 00:33:35.610
MARISHA: Tell him where we are!

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.050
LAURA: We're at Rumblecusp, by the way.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.003
It's the volcano island.

00:33:44.175 --> 00:33:45.508
See you, maybe!

00:33:45.508 --> 00:33:47.170
(laughter)

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.090
LIAM: Do you have one more in you?

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:50.010
LAURA: I do.
MARISHA: Hey, hang on, wait!

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.200
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait!
MARISHA: Let's see what he says.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.320
LAURA: I've got to wait for his response.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.170
I need to wait.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.380
LIAM: It's a big island.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:59.942 --> 00:34:01.690
LAURA: I'll wait, I'll wait.
TALIESIN: See if anything comes.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:03.590
MATT: So you take a moment,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.460
and eventually you begin to--

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.620
The Draconic language comes through,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.420
translated through the spell,

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.830
so the ideas come to your mind

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.140
through the divine channel of the spell,

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.230
to loosely read as,

00:34:22.433 --> 00:34:24.997
"I took your ship.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.891
"More.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.246
"Where?

00:34:35.185 --> 00:34:40.066
"I like it easy pickings.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.782
"Partway home already.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.680
"Interested, maybe,"

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.072
and that's all you hear.

00:34:57.072 --> 00:34:58.740
LAURA: He's interested, maybe!

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.630
TRAVIS: Was it "on the way home already"?

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.922
LAURA: Yeah, he said he was on the way home already.

00:35:03.922 --> 00:35:05.980
(sighs)
ASHLEY: Maybe tell him there's lots of them.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.070
Lots of ships.
TALIESIN: Lots of them.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.860
Exactly where they are.
LIAM: Unguarded.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.000
TALIESIN: Unguarded, and time is limited.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.833
LAURA: Okay.

00:35:14.833 --> 00:35:15.893
ASHLEY: Good, good, good, good.

00:35:15.893 --> 00:35:20.130
TALIESIN: Because we're going to take it and run soon.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.660
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: That's a lot to fit in.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.150
MARISHA: What side of the island is Heaven Falls on?

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.060
East side?
MATT: East side, yeah.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.210
TALIESIN: East side of the island, behind the waterfall.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.650
MARISHA: Behind the waterfall.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.510
LAURA: With your spell

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:35.300
that you can make people understand things, languages?

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.133
LIAM: Yeah.

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:38.000
LAURA: Is it only reading, or is it talking?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.610
LIAM: Well, it's two separate things.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.950
LAURA: Can you make me be able to talk his language?

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:44.570
LIAM: Tomorrow.
LAURA: Okay.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:45.740
TRAVIS: That upside-down waterfall's

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.560
not going to uppercut him into the stratosphere, is it?

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.258
Like it did us?
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:35:50.258 --> 00:35:51.790
TRAVIS: (wailing)

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.290
LAURA: He's pretty big; I don't think it will do it to him.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.980
TRAVIS: Okay, just checking.
MARISHA: But that would be funny.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.270
TRAVIS: We'll know when he gets there!

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.259
(laughter)

00:35:58.259 --> 00:35:59.528
(moaning)

00:35:59.528 --> 00:36:00.920
LIAM: Oh, wait. No, no, no.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.970
LAURA: You could do it?
LIAM: I can do it, yeah.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.400
Because this is the same day

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.080
with the "everything is cake" tower that we...

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.976
MATT: Correct, yes.
LIAM: Yeah, I can do it.

00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:10.604
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Good ref.

00:36:10.604 --> 00:36:12.736
LAURA: Oh my gosh, okay, yeah!

00:36:12.736 --> 00:36:14.530
Cast it on me and then I'll be able to talk to him!

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.800
LIAM: Yeah, Jester, yeah, yeah, yeah...

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.770
Hold on. I'm just looking through D&amp;D Beyond.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.000
Where did you go?
LAURA: ♪ D&amp;D! ♪

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.390
SAM: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪
(laughter)

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:26.480
LIAM: Yeah.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.970
So he pulls out a little stone tower

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.710
that you've seen once or twice,

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:34.100
and I hold it up,

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:38.980
and wave fingers at three points in front of your face

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.180
and cast Tongues on Jester.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.800
So you can understand any spoken language you hear.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.010
LAURA: Awesome, okay. I'm going--

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.320
LIAM: (American accent)
Can you understand what I'm saying right now?

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.270
LAURA: What the shit?!

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:52.790
What happened to your accent, Caleb?

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:54.915
LIAM: I don't have an accent.

00:36:54.915 --> 00:36:57.350
(laughter)

00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:59.440
This is flawless Zemnian.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.010
LAURA: Does that mean I'm speaking Zemnian?

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.379
(American accent) Does that mean I'm speaking Zemnian?

00:37:04.379 --> 00:37:07.518
(laughter)

00:37:07.518 --> 00:37:09.350
LIAM: (German accent) Is that what I
sound like most of the time?

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:12.096
SAM: Yeah, like sort of a Baltimore thing.

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:13.500
(laughter)

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.059
LIAM: Is that in the Empire?
SAM: Yeah.

00:37:17.059 --> 00:37:20.140
ASHLEY: It does sound just like that, though. That's weird.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.524
LIAM: Well, it suits you.
LAURA: (laughs) Thank you.

00:37:23.524 --> 00:37:27.800
(laughter)

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.560
SAM: Say water. How do you say water?

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.722
LAURA: Water.
(laughter)

00:37:31.722 --> 00:37:34.224
SAM: I was expecting--
ASHLEY and SAM: Wudder.

00:37:34.224 --> 00:37:35.150
LIAM: The accent...

00:37:37.042 --> 00:37:40.638
it's cute.
(laughter)

00:37:40.638 --> 00:37:41.790
It's complicated.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.460
LAURA: I'm speaking Zemnian right now.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.460
Can you understand me, Fjord?

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.070
TRAVIS: Feel like she's spitting at me.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.481
MARISHA: She sounds really angry, right?

00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:49.380
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.640
MARISHA: I think she's pissed at you.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.120
LAURA: (Jester's accent)
Okay, I'm going to send a message to the turtle.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.248
TALIESIN: What are the points?
LAURA: Okay, the points are:

00:37:57.248 --> 00:37:59.301
Easy pickings.

00:37:59.301 --> 00:38:00.134
I'm going to say--

00:38:00.134 --> 00:38:01.370
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:05.950
I'm going to say, lots of ships unguarded.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:09.100
Behind the upside-down waterfall.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.490
MARISHA: East side of the island.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.090
LAURA: East side of the island, upside-down waterfall.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.306
TALIESIN: Time is limited.

00:38:14.306 --> 00:38:16.999
LAURA: Time is limited, 'cause these things are moving out!

00:38:16.999 --> 00:38:19.400
TALIESIN: We're taking them tomorrow.
LAURA: Okay, well...

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.580
TALIESIN: Taking them tomorrow afternoon.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.810
TRAVIS: Tomorrow morning.
TALIESIN: Tomorrow morning.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:24.740
LAURA: Okay.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.640
SAM: Your accent sounds like a British actor

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.190
trying to do an American accent.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.260
It's really cool.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.050
TALIESIN: (exaggerated American accent)
I don't know what you mean.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.050
(laughter)

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.400
TRAVIS: (same accent) Hamburger.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.830
ASHLEY: (same accent) Hamburger.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:40.066
SAM: (same accent) I'm an American fighter pilot.

00:38:40.066 --> 00:38:43.172
(laughter)

00:38:43.172 --> 00:38:44.988
Kind of sounds like us.

00:38:44.988 --> 00:38:47.340
LAURA: Okay, okay.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.873
Going to cast Sending.
MATT: All right.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.650
MARISHA: You got this.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.132
LAURA: There's lots of ships, unguarded,

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.173
on the east side,

00:39:04.173 --> 00:39:07.014
behind the upside-down waterfall.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.010
But move fast,

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:15.301
'cause these things are

00:39:15.301 --> 00:39:19.617
flying off the shelves tomorrow!

00:39:19.617 --> 00:39:24.413
(laughter)
(applause)

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.103
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:39:27.561 --> 00:39:29.477
MATT: The response comes.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:36.484
"And why would you tell me this

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.228
"after destroying your ship

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:46.596
"and you left me an

00:39:46.596 --> 00:39:49.537
"slimy slug?

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.568
"I chased for days

00:39:56.568 --> 00:39:59.126
"for vengeance."

00:40:00.052 --> 00:40:01.400
That's the end of his response.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.460
MARISHA: Wow.
TALIESIN: Do we have another message?

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.240
MARISHA: You're right. They can still hold a grudge.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.955
LAURA: Oh, wait.
MARISHA: Getting transformed--

00:40:08.955 --> 00:40:10.840
LAURA: Not if I want to do Heroes' Feast tonight.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.180
TALIESIN: Oh.
LAURA: I got nothing.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.037
TRAVIS: That's all right. You've
got to leave them wanting more.

00:40:15.037 --> 00:40:17.760
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's like it's a--
LAURA: Maybe he's going to be curious.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.180
TRAVIS: Don't call him back after the first date.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.692
MATT: The tone-- while the voice sounds guttural,

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:29.515
he doesn't sound like he's shut you down.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.070
He's just being careful.
LAURA: Yeah, understandably.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.500
MATT: While he's not an ancient
dragon in intelligence per se,

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.220
he's lived long enough and dealt with enough

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.710
of different dubious minds and deals and such

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.168
that you get the sense that he's at least being careful.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.080
Smart enough not to just walk into a trap

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.610
because someone told him to.
LAURA: Right.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:52.840
ASHLEY: I mean, worst comes to worst,

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.606
we could totally fight

00:40:55.606 --> 00:40:59.210
D-Turts and Vokodo.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.410
We're strong enough to do that.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.350
TRAVIS: At the same time?
SAM: I don't...

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:04.141
Are you joking right now?

00:41:04.141 --> 00:41:04.977
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:41:04.977 --> 00:41:08.001
(laughter)

00:41:08.001 --> 00:41:10.366
SAM: Your expression never changes, not even a little.

00:41:10.366 --> 00:41:14.766
ASHLEY: No, I've been told I have a very dry sense of humor.

00:41:14.766 --> 00:41:16.380
TRAVIS: Delivery is--
SAM: Wow!

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.130
TRAVIS: -- quite plain.
SAM: Just one-liners.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.010
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.
LIAM: Also, if I may,

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.460
with the evolution of this dragon's name,

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.248
I would recommend we call him Dieter.

00:41:27.248 --> 00:41:28.245
LAURA: Dieter!
MARISHA: Dieter?

00:41:28.245 --> 00:41:29.653
LIAM: Dieter.
SAM: Dieter.

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:31.520
MARISHA: D-turd?
TALIESIN: Deter.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.890
LIAM: Dieter.
LAURA: No, Dieter.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:33.723
TALIESIN: Dieter.

00:41:33.723 --> 00:41:35.800
TALIESIN: What does Dieter mean in Zemnian?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.430
LIAM: It's just a name.
TRAVIS: Oh, well, great.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.200
LIAM: It means dragon turtle.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.490
TALIESIN: Ah, convenient.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.400
MARISHA: I do like D-Turts, though. That's fun, too.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.820
That feels like he's a cool guy.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.580
He's a cool turts.
TALIESIN: Bit informal.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.123
LIAM: I would not know.
MARISHA: Let's go party at D-Turts'.

00:41:52.123 --> 00:41:54.670
SAM: So, we've put the invitation out.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:55.590
Now what do we do?

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.210
TALIESIN: We don't have one more Sending, do we?

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.000
LAURA: I could send a message in the morning, but...

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:01.990
MARISHA: Well, maybe that's good.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.110
Maybe then we can gauge it in the morning.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.150
TRAVIS: "Oh, man, you guys. People are here early!

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.396
"There's a line outside. You better hurry!"

00:42:08.396 --> 00:42:12.779
(laughter)

00:42:15.811 --> 00:42:16.700
This is great!

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.550
What a good plan.
ASHLEY: I think it's a good plan.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.310
TRAVIS: We're going back to the village tonight?

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:23.177
SAM: I don't know.
TALIESIN: I wouldn't.

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.050
LAURA: Or do we just sleep here?

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.950
Because, you know, the thing is,

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:30.000
there's always a chance

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.950
that Guacamole could get in everyone's heads

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.060
a little bit stronger

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.415
and they could attack us.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.550
LAURA: Maybe he can take control of people.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.570
Like, who knows what he can do?

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.590
SAM: Would it be helpful at all

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.260
to have our own crew mates with us on this journey?

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.660
TRAVIS: Ooh. You mean Orly and Marius?

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.020
TALIESIN: They're a bit squishy.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.390
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Well, yes,

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.780
but, I mean, as a distraction or something.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.038
ASHLEY: Marius would surely die instantly.
TRAVIS: That's a little harsh.

00:42:57.038 --> 00:42:58.796
SAM: Well, or because

00:42:58.796 --> 00:43:00.800
we're going to be commandeering

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.180
a whole bunch of vessels, possibly.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.870
MARISHA: Another interesting point.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:08.140
We're going to have to kill Vokodo

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.030
in order for them to remember us.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:11.421
TALIESIN: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.770
MATT: "Well, they've only been here for a day.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:18.668
"We can't be certain until we get to them."

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.590
(laughter)

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.010
TRAVIS: Why?

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.330
Oh, shit!
MARISHA: Oh, shit, ahh!

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:31.210
MATT: "Regardless, if we're relying on my capabilities

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:34.690
"to bring us close to the outside of the mountain,

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.560
"whether it be near the Heaven Falls

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.077
"or the first entrance that I took you,

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.860
"that expends the most powerful magic

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.120
"I have at my disposal that day."

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.190
SAM: Got it.
LAURA: Oh, so do it tonight.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.580
SAM: So we should go where we're going to and halt.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.550
MATT: "Or, if it works best, I can take you the day of.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:54.340
"Just know, that does diminish my capabilities somewhat."

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.990
LAURA: Are you going to fight with us?

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:58.050
MATT: "I assumed I was, unless you wish otherwise."

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.960
LAURA: No, we would love it.
TALIESIN: That would be very helpful.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.880
LAURA: I just don't want to put you into that position,

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.350
if you didn't want to.
TRAVIS: I do.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:05.910
I really want to put you in that position.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.790
SAM: No, no, no, don't listen to Fjord.
TRAVIS: Quite powerful.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:09.730
SAM: You have a family at home

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.340
that you need to think about as well.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.970
MATT: "I do, but right now

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:14.940
"I have a family I've made here on this island

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.120
"that I still feel responsible for."

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.828
SAM: You consider us a family that fast?
LAURA: (laughs)

00:44:19.828 --> 00:44:21.340
MATT: "Sure. Um..."

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.320
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.870
MARISHA: Do you have kids here?
MATT: "No."

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:25.703
MARISHA: Oh.

00:44:25.703 --> 00:44:27.920
MATT: "But there are many good people here,

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.680
"at least good for the time that I've known them,

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.680
"and I don't want them damned to this life without choice."

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.270
LIAM: They say the V.O. community

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:39.921
is full of some of the best people you will find.

00:44:39.921 --> 00:44:42.179
SAM: True, it's true.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:43.750
LAURA: (laughs)
TRAVIS: I know we have two entrances

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:47.450
and we had talked about coming in from two different sides,

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:50.220
or do we want to hedge our bets,

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.737
or not hedge our bets, and go in through one?

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.930
Do we want to split up and come in from that...

00:44:59.724 --> 00:45:00.557
TALIESIN: I don't know. I feel like

00:45:00.557 --> 00:45:05.107
if he can really see us at all times,

00:45:05.107 --> 00:45:09.872
which I guess he can, it's not like we can hide.

00:45:09.872 --> 00:45:13.490
LAURA: We can't sneak up on him.
TALIESIN: So there's no sneaking up.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.970
So we either go in the way we know,

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:19.910
or go in this new way, but I wouldn't...

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:21.210
I don't know.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.140
It just seems...
MARISHA: Do any of you all

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:28.230
have any type of magic that would help with that?

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.980
TALIESIN: I mean...
TRAVIS: You mean cloak our...?

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.422
TALIESIN: What kind of magic?

00:45:32.261 --> 00:45:35.577
ASHLEY: Keep us hidden.
MARISHA: Force field cloaking magic?

00:45:35.577 --> 00:45:37.110
(laughter)
TALIESIN: I genuinely don't know

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:38.400
how he's doing this,

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.910
so I don't have anything.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:41.840
SAM: Yeah, I mean, I can turn invisible for a short time,

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.700
but I don't know if he can see our essence

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.402
or hear us or feel us, or...

00:45:45.402 --> 00:45:47.370
LAURA: He can't hear us.
SAM: He can't hear us?

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:48.203
LAURA: No.

00:45:48.203 --> 00:45:50.180
LIAM: We believe he cannot hear us.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.160
LAURA: We don't think he can.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.200
SAM: But if it's just purely visual, I mean.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.010
Some of us can become invisible, correct?

00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:58.650
MARISHA: It's true.
TALIESIN: Assuming that works.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:01.263
MARISHA: You could try it.

00:46:01.263 --> 00:46:02.600
Can you go invisible tonight and see

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.010
if you still feel that tingling sensation

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.460
like you're being watched?
LAURA: Didn't you do it before?

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.293
You did it already.

00:46:08.293 --> 00:46:09.980
SAM: I think I was invisible for a time.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.140
LAURA: And you still felt it.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.850
I think I remember.
SAM: Did I?

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:14.195
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:46:14.195 --> 00:46:18.962
MATT: The sensation of proximity,

00:46:18.962 --> 00:46:20.453
being watched,

00:46:20.453 --> 00:46:22.932
did not diminish when you were invisible.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.087
SAM: Well, either way, shouldn't we be near the ships

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.230
for when the dragon--
LIAM: I think so.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:32.063
SAM: -- Dieter comes?

00:46:32.063 --> 00:46:34.510
LIAM: Because Dieter is either coming or not,

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.020
and if he comes and wrecks things

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.170
and we are lucky enough

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.940
to have Vokodo leave his lair and exit,

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:40.830
if we are not there,

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:43.972
then we're not going to be able to take advantage of it.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.790
TRAVIS: How would Vokodo leave?

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.470
Through the tunnel, the first entrance that we went through?

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:52.780
The ship entrance?

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.790
Or is he going to...

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:56.750
LAURA: Who knows?
SAM: You mean leave permanently?

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:58.506
TRAVIS: Like, if he flees his lair...
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:46:58.506 --> 00:47:00.560
What if he climbs up and out of the volcano

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.830
and he comes out the top of it?

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:02.840
How cool would that be?

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.230
TRAVIS: I mean, he may just stay, but if he goes...

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:06.730
I'm just trying to think it out.

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:10.160
We're not going to set off a tremendous volcanic explosion

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.552
and kill everyone on the island, are we?

00:47:11.552 --> 00:47:12.577
ASHLEY: Ugh.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.750
SAM: Who knows?
TRAVIS: We have no way to know.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.820
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:17.810
TRAVIS: I suppose if he flees

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.760
through the first entrance we went through

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.590
and we're at the ship tunnels,

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:23.340
then he would be on the other side of the mountain,

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.260
and we wouldn't really be able to help.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.335
MARISHA: Also, does Vokodo even care about the ships?

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:32.050
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Hard to say.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:32.883
I think he does

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:35.130
in terms of keeping people on the island, right?

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.220
TALIESIN: But why not just destroy
them instead of hoarding them?

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:41.210
SAM: Well, speaking as a hoarder myself,

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:43.060
I've collected things all my life,

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:47.020
and this gentleman Vokodo seems...

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.780
I mean, I have a kinship with him,

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:54.780
because he keeps a lot of wonderful, shiny objects

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.420
around him at all times,

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.880
and I've had that same passion my whole life,

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.370
and if these ships are part of his collection,

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:04.940
he won't want to part with them.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.700
He won't want to see them destroyed.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.720
LIAM: And it seems he wants things of value,

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.700
and a means of escaping the island

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.900
are all of these people's valuable asset.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.910
Probably the only reason he does not have them

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.400
in his chamber with him is because of their size,

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.940
so he has them as close as possible, perhaps.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.378
TRAVIS: Seems like the best bet, then.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.400
TALIESIN: So, if we stay at that end,

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:32.340
see if we can get the dragon turtle

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.260
in the cave, doing damage.
LAURA: Dragon turtle,

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.210
attacking the butthole.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:41.030
TALIESIN: And then we can come
in once that starts going down.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.640
MARISHA: And maybe if he doesn't come out,

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.940
Vokodo isn't lured out,

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.090
maybe then we can make the dragon turtle smaller

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:53.090
and send him further up the bloodstream, maybe.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:57.150
LIAM: Or grab him like a package and bring him in.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:00.050
That's insane, but it could work.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:01.800
MARISHA: But I like it.
ASHLEY: I like it, too.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.030
TRAVIS: This is a great plan.
MARISHA: I like it.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.140
SAM: This is a great plan!

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.600
LIAM: So maybe we make our way there tonight,

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.600
and we camp on ships towards the rear of the impound lot

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.500
near the entrance to the butthole?

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:16.850
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: And time permitting,

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:19.390
maybe we could even, if there's room

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.340
in that vast cavern where the ships were,

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.270
maybe we could sort of

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:25.818
hide one off to the side for ourself?

00:49:27.468 --> 00:49:29.152
TALIESIN: (hums) I would recommend

00:49:29.152 --> 00:49:34.152
we not be seen staging the

00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:35.960
territory, so to speak.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.180
TRAVIS: We also have to control the water long enough

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.537
to get a ship, a big ship, through,

00:49:41.537 --> 00:49:43.040
and not have the spell falter

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.180
because then, goodbye ship.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.400
SAM: All right.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.730
Well, then, let's just get there.

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.240
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.430
MATT: "All right, then."

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.200
SAM: To Heaven's Fall.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.370
Heaven Falls?
MATT: "Heaven Falls.

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:57.240
"I gather we'll take a tree

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.733
"nearby where we camped the night before?"

00:50:00.733 --> 00:50:01.699
SAM: Sure.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:50:01.699 --> 00:50:02.532
MATT: "(sighs) It's been a while.

00:50:02.532 --> 00:50:03.370
"Follow me."

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:04.500
You see she rubs her hands,

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:09.330
and takes a step towards one of the larger trees,

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.340
just as you guys have stepped into the jungle

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.410
past the elements where the wilds begin to wither

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:18.835
and you bypassed the sentient,

00:50:18.835 --> 00:50:21.552
undead large trees that you had snuck past.

00:50:21.552 --> 00:50:23.290
Once you go beyond that space,

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:27.760
you come to the first pack of healthy, thick-rooted trees

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.780
in the middle of the jungle there.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.500
Vilya approaches, rubs her hands,

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.880
takes her staff and runs it

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.460
in a diagonal line across the trunk, and as it does,

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:41.535
you see this faint light green, gold sparkle.

00:50:41.535 --> 00:50:43.910
Shh, like a zipper, begin to pull down.

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:46.601
As it does, it opens into this oval, shimmering doorway,

00:50:46.601 --> 00:50:49.509
As it does, it opens into this oval, shimmering doorway,

00:50:49.509 --> 00:50:52.480
and on the other side, you can immediately see

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.720
about three or four feet of what looks like carved wood,

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.810
almost like there's a tunnel.

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:00.610
There's a walled tunnel of smooth wood

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.490
where you can see the striations and rings

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:03.970
on the interior of the tree,

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.676
and on the other side, white beach and an ocean.

00:51:07.676 --> 00:51:10.090
LAURA: (gasping)
ASHLEY: That is so cool.

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.238
MATT: "Quickly, please."
LAURA: Oh, oh, okay!

00:51:11.238 --> 00:51:13.057
SAM: Oh, yes. Go, go, go, go, go!

00:51:13.057 --> 00:51:14.430
TRAVIS: Thought she was full of shit.

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:15.710
MATT: As you all rush through,

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.030
there's a brief moment,

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.160
a similar rush sensation,

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.710
though much shorter than the one you're familiar with

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:24.050
with Teleportation via Caleb.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:27.870
And as you step out, your feet find the soft, hot sand

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:31.340
on the white beaches on the eastern shore of Rumblecusp.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.997
And just as you all emerge and you watch Vilya escape,

00:51:33.997 --> 00:51:36.230
(whooshing)
it closes behind her

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.980
and just the tree trunk of one of the palms there

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.640
is left like nothing had happened.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.820
LAURA: That was awesome!
ASHLEY: That is a very cool trick.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:43.653
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

00:51:43.653 --> 00:51:44.486
LAURA: What would happen

00:51:44.486 --> 00:51:45.820
if you were halfway through the tree when it closed?

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.120
Would you get cut in half?

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:50.026
MATT: "Let's hope we never find out."

00:51:50.026 --> 00:51:50.859
LAURA: (exclaims)

00:51:50.859 --> 00:51:53.150
ASHLEY: Just mummified in the tree? Petrified?

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:54.250
LAURA: Like, just a hand's...

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:55.580
MATT: "I'm sure it's happened.

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.470
"I've been careful before."
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.750
MARISHA: Maybe that's how faces get trees.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.517
How trees get faces.
TRAVIS: How faces get trees!

00:52:03.517 --> 00:52:05.817
(laughter)
Holy shit.

00:52:05.817 --> 00:52:07.540
(laughter)

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.910
ASHLEY: What's weird is it totally made sense to me.

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:11.626
I was like, "Yeah, you're right."
MARISHA: Yasha was on

00:52:11.626 --> 00:52:13.659
the same page, okay?
ASHLEY: Same page.

00:52:13.659 --> 00:52:15.570
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: (laughs)

00:52:16.556 --> 00:52:19.270
MATT: You can hear the distant sound of the Heaven Falls

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:20.980
crashing not far from here.

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:22.010
You are at the exact beach

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:23.730
where you guys had rested the night before.

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.370
So you still have an afternoon.

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:27.950
If there's any further planning you want to do,

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:30.350
you guys can discuss or set up for the night.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:32.025
The evening's yours, so...

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.080
LIAM: Did we ever take a short rest?

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.530
MATT: Not since you left the Ruin.
SAM: Let's do that.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.105
MATT: I don't believe so.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.060
TRAVIS: Short rest?
LIAM: Yeah, I would like to.

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.440
LAURA: I don't think we did.

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.530
We might have done it...

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:47.120
No, I think we did it right after

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.370
when we were at the Ruins, we did it.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:50.510
When we were searching everything.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:51.650
MATT: That's correct, that's correct.

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:53.962
ASHLEY: We did, yeah.

00:52:53.962 --> 00:52:54.955
LIAM: Okay.

00:52:54.955 --> 00:52:57.090
SAM: Well, what other preparations do we need?

00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:59.300
Do we need to go into the cavern

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.520
and sort of get a lay of the land,

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.720
figure out where we're going to be?

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.578
TRAVIS: Anything changed from the last time

00:53:04.578 --> 00:53:06.753
that we were here that we can see?

00:53:06.753 --> 00:53:09.160
MATT: Make a perception or investigation check.

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.830
TRAVIS: Investigation, please.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:13.830
Ooh, 25.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:15.780
MATT: 25.

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:16.750
Glancing about the sands,

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:18.520
you can see the tracks left behind.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.600
You can see the indentations

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.760
where you guys spent the evening,

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.700
though it looks like a bit of the seaside wind

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.240
has blown some elements of sand

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:29.930
to soften the impact of where bodies lied.

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:31.700
But nothing seems to be disturbed

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:35.303
beyond the tracks you left when you made your way.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:39.380
TRAVIS: Seems safe.
LAURA: Oh, man.

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:40.530
TALIESIN: This could be where you set up

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:44.460
the Welcome to Traveler Con.
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.590
TALIESIN: Be a nice beach.
LAURA: That'd be really nice.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:47.980
TALIESIN: Show up and give everybody a badge.

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:49.450
LAURA: I just realized, you guys.

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:54.220
I can't control the water to get back into the cavern.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.103
TRAVIS: I can.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:53:58.245 --> 00:54:00.453
Good. (laughs)

00:54:00.453 --> 00:54:02.180
MATT: All right. You guys heading back to the falls, then?

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:03.600
LIAM: I think we should, yeah.

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.080
I think we should bed down in there for the night,

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.760
because if he's with us at all times,

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:13.510
it will seem like perhaps we are just finding shelter.

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:15.830
He knows that we're doing something,

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:17.230
but it would seem...

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:18.920
I don't think we should monkey with any boats,

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.800
as Caduceus said.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.020
Should just look like we're sheltering for the night,

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.230
and then maybe thinking of coming

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:26.480
to give him an offering or something.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.660
SAM: If we go back in there,

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.090
Caduceus, will you be able to control your urges

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:32.730
to swim down and through?
TALIESIN: No.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:35.223
SAM: All right.
TALIESIN: No, I'll be fine.

00:54:35.223 --> 00:54:37.170
(laughter)

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:38.724
SAM: Yasha, just in case?

00:54:38.724 --> 00:54:41.307
MARISHA: (clears her throat)

00:54:41.307 --> 00:54:42.740
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: Just get ready.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.620
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Not to kill him.

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.080
ASHLEY: Just knock him out?
TRAVIS: Not kill, yeah.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:45.913
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no.

00:54:45.913 --> 00:54:47.780
SAM: Do what you have to do.
ASHLEY: Just a "Go to sleep."

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:48.613
TRAVIS: That'd be sufficient.

00:54:48.613 --> 00:54:49.770
"Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep."

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.410
ASHLEY: We could tie a rope around each other, you know.

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.630
SAM: Oh, yeah!
ASHLEY: So we're sleeping,

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:56.690
if one goes, we all go.
TALIESIN: That tends to go well.

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.167
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah!

00:54:58.167 --> 00:54:59.957
(laughter)

00:54:59.957 --> 00:55:02.074
TRAVIS: When has that never not worked out?

00:55:02.074 --> 00:55:04.596
(laughter)

00:55:04.596 --> 00:55:06.580
MATT: All right, so you guys wade your way back out

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:11.580
into the open lagoon that leads towards the Heaven Falls.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.400
Approaching, as you get closer and closer to it,

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.420
the water itself still firing up with the same intensity

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.180
that it previously has.
TRAVIS: Yep, yep.

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.140
MATT: You have use of Control Water, you said?

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:23.973
TRAVIS: I do.

00:55:23.973 --> 00:55:26.830
LAURA: I point out to Fjord where he should do it

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:30.550
so that it does the least amount of damage to us

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:33.290
as we go through it.
TRAVIS: And do you split it?

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:34.460
Do you put it off to the left or right?

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:35.580
You just stopped it entirely?

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:37.260
What did you do?
LAURA: I split it, but, you know,

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.070
you might be able to just put it off to the side

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.550
if we go into the side of the cavern.

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:44.213
That might be easier, I'm not sure.

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:46.670
TRAVIS: Whatever you think will work.

00:55:47.806 --> 00:55:49.828
I only can do it one time.

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.337
LAURA: Just try it from the side.

00:55:52.337 --> 00:55:54.090
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll--
LAURA: Maybe that's better.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:56.215
TRAVIS: Side, yeah. So I'll walk up and--
MATT: Okay.

00:55:56.215 --> 00:55:58.680
TRAVIS: Literally try and shift so that one side becomes open.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.055
MATT: All right. You guys watch as Fjord

00:56:01.055 --> 00:56:03.155
wades out a little further,

00:56:03.155 --> 00:56:04.820
putting his hand forward and concentrating.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.580
The large, solid beam of water

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.940
begins to--
(rushing water)

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.440
And shift to one side.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.650
As it does, you can now see the wetted cliff-side

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.680
atop that is left to glisten under the sun,

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.900
and the water is now firing off

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.950
and spraying somewhere in the jungle

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.930
down the southern side of where it once was,

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:28.220
and you can see now the cliff-face behind it

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:31.333
is now exposed and seemingly safe to traverse.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.320
TALIESIN: Somewhere there's a very soggy tyrannosaurus.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.120
TRAVIS: Not a problem.
TALIESIN: Yep, going.

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:36.953
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: All right.

00:56:36.953 --> 00:56:38.090
One by one, you all make your way

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:41.340
into the familiar interior of the tunnel without issue.

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.920
You all take a wide berth

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.320
to not be pulled into the rapid current

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.410
that is immediately around

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:49.260
where it's breaking the water's surface.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.420
MARISHA: It's tempting, though!
MATT: It is tempting.

00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.350
Then you come into the darkened chamber,

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.800
the familiar sounds of water droplets all around you,

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.490
and you can see, in the space,

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:02.620
the shape of all the various ships as you left them.

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.910
But the cavern is yours.

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:07.930
MARISHA: What time is it? Still afternoon?

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:08.763
MATT: Still afternoon.

00:57:08.763 --> 00:57:09.630
You guys have time,

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:11.460
but you don't have to spend the afternoon

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:12.293
if you want to jump ahead.

00:57:12.293 --> 00:57:13.610
You can just say the things you want to do

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:15.150
and then continue from there.

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:16.950
LAURA: I thought it was later in the day.

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:19.930
I thought it was getting evening

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:22.966
by the time it was ending the last time.

00:57:22.966 --> 00:57:24.840
MATT: It was later afternoon, evening.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.890
LAURA: Was it?

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:28.330
SAM: Do we want to--
MARISHA: 4:00pm.

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.880
SAM: Do we want to set up a hidey spot

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.030
on anywhere in here, or...?
LAURA: Yeah, find a good--

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:35.640
TALIESIN: We should take a walk about

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.210
and look around a little bit more,

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:39.940
and maybe figure out if there's a place that...

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.140
SAM: It's all water, right?

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.170
Is there a walkway around the perimeter, or...?

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.240
MARISHA: There's an embankment.
TRAVIS: A catwalk. No manmade stuff.

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.450
MATT: The ships are placed on the sides,

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.660
and you can see there's the walls of the cavern.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:55.118
There's a slight element of...

00:57:56.335 --> 00:57:58.035
silt and some sand

00:57:58.035 --> 00:57:59.740
that gives a slight embankment

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:00.910
but it's all gradual,

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:03.040
so it's not like a platform or any sort of a sand bank

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.690
that you can stand on comfortably.

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:07.860
You can get up against the wall

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.880
and it'll keep you there, but it's a decline

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.280
and it slips the further out you go immediately.

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.068
ASHLEY: We could just hang out on Eden's Horizon.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.120
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah, that wasn't too close,

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.220
where we were feeling the pull, right?

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.320
Still safe?
MATT: Yeah, it's far enough away.

00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:28.630
LAURA: It's not right when you come in, though,

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:32.070
because if Dieter does come in--
LIAM: Comes busting through.

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:34.110
LAURA: I don't want to be on the ship he sees first,

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.560
you know what I mean?

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.780
MATT: No, it's not immediately right there.

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.110
It's a little ways in.
LAURA: Okay.

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:40.520
MATT: It's, like, halfway through the cavern itself.

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.830
TALIESIN: There is also the question is,

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:43.160
if we go into the cavern,

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.660
how are we going to find our way?

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.390
LAURA: One of us will have to be taken.

00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:51.640
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we've just got to let it happen.

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.220
LAURA: Then we just follow whoever fails.

00:58:56.090 --> 00:58:56.923
SAM: Oh, wow.

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:00.750
That's disturbing.
ASHLEY: But it disappears

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:02.240
when you get close to him.

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.240
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: So...

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.350
LAURA: Yeah, it just takes you to the chamber, that's all.

00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:08.150
TALIESIN: We'll also need to breathe underwater.

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:10.098
TRAVIS: I just re-upped everyone.
TALIESIN: Oh, well.

00:59:10.098 --> 00:59:11.773
TRAVIS: Yeah. But the rope's not a bad idea,

00:59:11.773 --> 00:59:13.920
because some of us can swim a lot faster than the others.

00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:16.230
They would get lost.

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:18.140
SAM: Does anyone have a bunch of rope?

00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.790
MARISHA: Yeah, a few of us do.
TRAVIS: I have 50 feet of rope.

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.040
MARISHA: I have 50 feet as well.

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:24.630
SAM: Cool.
TALIESIN: I do not have rope.

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:27.483
ASHLEY: I have rope.

00:59:27.483 --> 00:59:29.409
TALIESIN: Honestly, I'm actually missing a lot of things.

00:59:29.409 --> 00:59:31.510
LAURA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Man.

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:33.120
SAM: So shall we just feast and sleep,

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.814
or is there more planning that we need to do?

00:59:35.814 --> 00:59:38.439
TRAVIS: (exhales) Sure feels like
there's more we need to do, doesn't it?

00:59:38.439 --> 00:59:40.470
LIAM: Well...
TRAVIS: Really.

00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:43.430
LIAM: Everything changes if Dieter does not come.

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:45.947
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Hopefully he does.

00:59:45.947 --> 00:59:46.780
If he does not come,

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:50.200
we are going to enter for more offerings,

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.660
and just throw down, I would imagine.

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:54.937
We also have to survive our sleep.

00:59:54.937 --> 00:59:55.770
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.475
LIAM: And see if we all remember who we are,

00:59:58.475 --> 01:00:01.160
and deal with that if it is a problem.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.280
LAURA: Yeah.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.150
We should get some more gold dust ready

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:09.260
just in case somebody does need help in the morning.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.460
TRAVIS: We should probably take shifts while we sleep.

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.690
If he's been watching us

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.350
and we've been traveling all over the island

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:16.550
and he's clocking us as a threat,

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:19.200
we are pretty close to where he is,

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.700
just on the off-chance that he's like,

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.950
"Oh, I'm going to go get them while they sleep."

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.760
TALIESIN: Little thread ought to do that.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:29.080
Also, we're going to be sleeping in a bubble, right?

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:31.253
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Or no? Okay.

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:32.380
LIAM: Yeah.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:33.630
SAM: Except it's not a bubble, though.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:34.620
It's a dome, right?

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.470
LIAM: Yeah, it does not go all the way around, but...

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.050
LAURA: So, he could come up from underneath,

01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:39.517
because it is a boat.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.173
LIAM: Yeah. He would have to go through

01:00:42.173 --> 01:00:46.258
all of our large ship to get to us, but...

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.540
And then when the moment happens,

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:55.133
either here in the shipyard, or in Vokodo's lair,

01:00:56.610 --> 01:01:00.140
we will try to send him away, no?

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:03.090
So you all have to keep him busy.

01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:05.952
TRAVIS: Yes. We can do that.

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.525
MARISHA: As long as I can get up to him.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:14.730
LAURA: I can-- I have a spell for that.

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:15.563
MARISHA: Dope.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.160
MATT: For the two clerics,

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.850
how much diamond dust do you still have left?

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:22.470
LAURA: Is it diamond dust that we need?

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.286
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Or gold dust? Okay, it's diamond dust?

01:01:24.286 --> 01:01:26.800
MATT: Diamond dust for the Greater Restoration.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.209
LAURA: Let me look at my diamonds.

01:01:29.209 --> 01:01:30.800
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, that is the variable.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:34.340
How many of us fail tonight.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.410
ASHLEY: Yeah. (exhales)

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:36.400
MATT: Vilya, checking in, says,

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.950
"I only have components for one more casting myself."

01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:42.210
LAURA: And it's how much worth?
MATT: 100.

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:43.443
LAURA: 100.

01:01:43.443 --> 01:01:48.010
I have a 300 gold diamond and a 500 gold diamond.

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:50.090
SAM: Ooh. But we have to pulverize?

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:54.640
LAURA: Although I've got 100 gold
left from one of the diamonds

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.740
because we didn't do it.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.293
This is retroactive.

01:01:58.853 --> 01:02:00.780
SAM: Do we need to pulverize it somehow, or...?

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.550
TALIESIN: Do you have any more diamond as well, or...?

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:07.520
SAM: I don't, but I have a substitute.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.620
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.610
SAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: Residuum.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:13.453
SAM: Residuum.

01:02:13.453 --> 01:02:17.090
LIAM: I can pulverize a gem in the morning.

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:18.040
MARISHA: I have a jeweler's kit.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.980
I can just take the night to file one down.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.813
TRAVIS: (imitates filing)

01:02:22.813 --> 01:02:25.320
LAURA: If I say we destroyed--
TRAVIS: "I'm fine!"

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.040
LAURA: If I say we destroyed one of the diamonds,

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.710
the 300 gold diamond, you cast Greater Restoration

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:33.657
how many times the last time?

01:02:35.713 --> 01:02:36.978
Did you cast it twice?

01:02:36.978 --> 01:02:39.395
LIAM: (sighs)

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:41.990
LAURA: Vilya cast it--
MATT: Vilya cast it once.

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:43.340
TRAVIS: Yeah, she cast it on you.

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.500
You cast it on her.
LAURA: I cast it on you.

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:47.840
MATT: But you also cast it on Vilya,

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.880
so it's four times it's been used.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.715
LAURA: Four times it's been used?
TALIESIN: Four times.

01:02:54.815 --> 01:02:56.760
Going through my stuff.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.960
SAM: Do you have <i>any</i> diamonds?
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, I do.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.400
I'm just trying to figure out--

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.075
I don't have any powdered diamonds.

01:03:05.075 --> 01:03:06.020
I would've...
LAURA: But we can say

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.720
that Caleb would've powdered them.

01:03:11.391 --> 01:03:13.180
MATT: How much residuum do you have?

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.635
SAM: I have 700 gold pieces' worth.

01:03:15.635 --> 01:03:16.810
TALIESIN: (whistling)

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:19.550
MATT: So that's seven casts, as long as somebody--

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.360
SAM: It totally replaces?

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.080
MATT: Residuum can be used to replace

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.740
any sort of material component cost of equal cost,

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.070
but only if they have it on their person to use it.

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:32.030
SAM: Well, I will give you all the residuum, then.

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:35.410
I'll give 400 to you, Jester, and 300 to you, Caduceus.

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:38.350
TALIESIN: How much?
SAM: 300.

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:41.155
TALIESIN: Wow, okay.
SAM: I don't need it.

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:47.670
Just giving away all my shit.
MATT: (laughs)

01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:49.870
MARISHA: Maybe you're not such a hoarder after all.

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:54.200
Growth.
MATT: (laughs)

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.800
SAM: I really want it back, though.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.890
MARISHA: Oh. I don't think that's how it works.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.220
TALIESIN: Just checking how much it takes to...

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:07.410
Pop someone back to life if something bad happens.

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:11.190
LAURA: It's 300. It's a 300 gold diamond.

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:14.020
TALIESIN: I've got a 350 diamond.
LAURA: I've got a 300 diamond

01:04:15.417 --> 01:04:18.370
and a 500 gold diamond.
TALIESIN: The 500's the Hail Mary

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:20.100
if something goes really, really wrong.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:23.280
300's a quick fix.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.690
500's a long-term problem.
LAURA: Well, one of them...

01:04:27.959 --> 01:04:29.977
Oh, god.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.400
So I'm going to say we used residuum for the last ones.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.060
This is so hard to do retroactive.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:38.260
So I've got 300 gold worth of residuum.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:42.031
SAM: Do you have the plans for
the American war base as well?

01:04:42.031 --> 01:04:44.975
(laughter)

01:04:44.975 --> 01:04:46.928
TRAVIS: Coca-Cola.

01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:50.330
LIAM: Here's what we're going to do.

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:51.688
LAURA: And you have--
TRAVIS: John Wayne.

01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:53.880
LAURA: -- 200 gold worth of residuum?

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.460
TALIESIN: I cast twice, so I would have 100.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.790
LAURA: Got it, okay.
MATT: All right.

01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:01.720
Well, there you go.
TALIESIN: And 50 diamond

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.906
if someone grinds them down.

01:05:02.906 --> 01:05:05.400
SAM: 50 on a gift certificate.
MATT: So, with that said,

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:09.190
you guys can rest for the evening early if you'd like to,

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:12.390
and wake up early after a eight-hour rest,

01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:13.670
if that's the case,

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:16.900
if you're looking for maximized time for Water Breathing

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.700
and anything else you want to do before bed.

01:05:20.090 --> 01:05:21.970
Your call.
MARISHA: Fancy Feast.

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:25.320
LAURA: Yeah. Set it up on the, uh...

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.770
On the deck of this here ship?

01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:30.050
MATT: All right. You guys have situated now

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:33.540
up on top of the Eden's Horizon,

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.450
after getting your materials ready

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:37.850
for any possible encounters in the day to come.

01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:43.460
Jester, describe how you set your Heroes' Feast out.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.950
LAURA: Oh man, oh man!

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:47.560
Do we have tables here on this deck, or is it just--?

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:51.500
I'm going to make it just a
really pretty setup with blankets.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.560
I'm going to use some of my blue fabric

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.007
to set up picnic blankets all over the deck, you know?

01:05:57.007 --> 01:05:57.843
MATT: Okay.

01:05:57.843 --> 01:06:01.768
LAURA: And it's going to be like a feast of

01:06:02.768 --> 01:06:05.234
pancakes and...

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:08.860
Lots of pancakes.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:13.550
Some candy, some scones.

01:06:15.718 --> 01:06:17.000
A little bit of, what,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.100
like, potatoes for Caduceus.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.690
Do you want some mushrooms or something?

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:23.515
TALIESIN: I can eat pancakes. Pancakes are fine.
LAURA: Great, pancakes.

01:06:23.515 --> 01:06:24.700
So more pancakes!

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.328
MARISHA: It's a continental breakfast buffet.

01:06:26.328 --> 01:06:27.820
LAURA: And then-- yeah.

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:30.295
I figure some pocket bacon for Beau.

01:06:30.295 --> 01:06:32.350
TRAVIS: All the carbs.
TALIESIN: Very carby.

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:35.610
LAURA: Some weird-looking bug sort of things for Yasha,

01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:37.060
just because they're interesting-looking,

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.910
but really they taste like chocolate.

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:41.170
ASHLEY: Oh, yes.
LAURA: Spicy chocolate.

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.780
ASHLEY: Oh, very good.
TALIESIN: That's fine.

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:45.210
ASHLEY: It has a little bit of a kick.

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.190
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: And...

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.740
It's really colorful.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:52.490
You know, unicorn whipped cream sort of stuff.

01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:56.130
TALIESIN: Hook Lost Boys.

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:58.800
LAURA: Yeah! Very similar to, yeah, Hook.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.812
But not quite so primary colors.

01:07:00.812 --> 01:07:03.377
They're more pastel sort of shades.
TRAVIS: You're doing it, Peter!

01:07:03.377 --> 01:07:06.150
LAURA: Cakes, cookies...

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:08.160
Do you guys want anything more substantial,

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.010
or is this good?
SAM: No, this is good.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.910
LAURA: Give everyone stomach aches before we go in?

01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:16.797
TRAVIS: Yep. Give everybody the reenies.
MATT: Yep.

01:07:16.797 --> 01:07:19.690
Possibly type 2 diabetes.
LIAM: One bowl of greens, perhaps.

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:20.523
Just one.

01:07:21.590 --> 01:07:22.423
LAURA: Caleb.

01:07:22.423 --> 01:07:24.164
SAM: Like a cucumber salad. He likes dill, and--

01:07:24.164 --> 01:07:25.281
LIAM: Have to be regular.

01:07:25.281 --> 01:07:27.250
LAURA: God, okay, okay.
TRAVIS: Fiber.

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:31.150
LAURA: There's one teeny, tiny bowl of cucumber salad.

01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:33.777
TALIESIN: It's got Jell-O in it. That's weird.

01:07:33.777 --> 01:07:35.053
(laughter)

01:07:35.053 --> 01:07:37.716
LAURA: It's got green sprinkles on the top for sure.

01:07:37.716 --> 01:07:39.149
(laughter)
MATT: All right.

01:07:39.149 --> 01:07:41.250
LIAM: Just green icing.
LAURA: Oh, and some nuts,

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:43.060
because that's what Sprinkle likes to eat.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:43.893
MATT: There you go.

01:07:45.297 --> 01:07:47.501
LIAM: I thought Sprinkle liked to eat shit.

01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:50.330
TRAVIS: How is Sprinkle?
LAURA: Sprinkle's doing great.

01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:51.780
TALIESIN: Hasn't moved in three days.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.090
MATT: You see from underneath
the shawl that Jester wears,

01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:58.320
this small, skittering weasel head

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:02.550
slowly peers out--
(squeaks and hisses)

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:04.850
And just withdraws back in.
LAURA: He's so good!

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:07.673
LIAM: Is he a revenant yet?
TRAVIS: "I hope we lose!"

01:08:07.673 --> 01:08:08.790
MATT: You don't know.
MARISHA: He's got to be.

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:11.170
SAM: When we were at the ruins, I think I saw Sprinkle

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.516
trying to get into one of the coffins.

01:08:13.516 --> 01:08:14.980
(laughter)
LAURA: No, he wasn't.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.480
He was not, Veth.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.327
TRAVIS: "Let Vokodo come!"

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:19.501
LAURA: He's so comfy!

01:08:19.501 --> 01:08:20.830
Look how comfy my cloak is.

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:23.357
It's so comfy.
TRAVIS: "Offer me up."

01:08:23.357 --> 01:08:24.970
(laughter)

01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:27.980
MATT: So, Jester, as you finish your invocation,

01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:31.610
you set, amongst this blue sheet

01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:32.960
that you've laid out here on the deck--

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.426
LAURA: It's green.
MATT: It's gr--?

01:08:34.426 --> 01:08:36.542
Oh, because it's one of the cloaks.

01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:38.330
Oh, there you go, respect.

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:39.163
I misheard.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.710
You place this gemmed chalice onto it,

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:45.974
and as you close your eyes,
having taken everyone's orders...

01:08:45.974 --> 01:08:48.630
(laughter)

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:51.790
You begin to place your hands down on the sides of it

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:53.180
and lift the fingers up,

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:56.010
and as you do, you watch the chalice seems to fill.

01:08:56.010 --> 01:08:59.360
As it fills with this reddish, orange liquid,

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.790
that at first is a little worrying to all of you.

01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:05.473
As it spills over, it actually forms

01:09:05.473 --> 01:09:07.889
a red tablecloth

01:09:07.889 --> 01:09:09.820
around the sides of it,

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.940
so overtaking the green you put down there.

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.560
LAURA: But I still want it to be on the ground.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.500
This is a cute picnic.
MATT: Yes, it's on the ground.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.890
It's on the ground.
LAURA: Very Mad Hatter.

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:19.570
Like, everybody gets their own teacup.

01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:21.300
MATT: Yes.
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.570
MATT: As it spreads out, you
watch as from within this cloth--

01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:27.010
which almost, it looks like a velvet,

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:28.730
but as you get close to it,

01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:29.900
it's reflecting what's above it.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.690
It's almost like a still surface of water,

01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:35.930
and suddenly the water begins to become disturbed,

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:38.530
and you see from within shapes begin to emerge,

01:09:38.530 --> 01:09:40.570
and as they do, platters begin to arise.

01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:43.120
Poof, poof. Bowls, plates.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.060
A veritable smorgasbord of pancakes,

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.520
of real cakes, of sweets, candies,

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.840
a bowl of nuts, a salad...
(laughter)

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.270
A unique spread.

01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:56.820
And as they begin to emerge, the coloration of the red

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.080
begins to shift and give way,

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.370
like the color itself is what's giving life

01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:04.510
to each of these small bowls and large spreads,

01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:05.660
and as it does, it's left behind

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.750
with a weird translucent green color

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:10.510
that mingles with the sheet beneath it.

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.540
It looks delicious, it smells delicious,

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.620
and everything seems to have this faintly glowing hue to it

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:17.520
that's slightly off-putting,

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.460
but still, the other senses tell you this is an invitation.

01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:24.190
SAM: Is there enough for Vilya as well?

01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:25.810
LAURA: Oh, yeah, everybody gets some.

01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:27.610
Sprinkle gets some. Everybody gets some.

01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:30.101
MATT: "I'm not going to lie, it's been
a very long time since I've had a pancake.

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:32.170
"I'm very excited for this."

01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:33.220
TRAVIS: Pancake!
LAURA: (laughs)

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.760
MATT: You all dig into this veritable Heroes' Feast.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.690
It is delicious, it is invigorating,

01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:41.870
and for the next 24 hours...?
LAURA: Yes.

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:44.500
MATT: You have advantage on wisdom saving throws,

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:49.060
you are immune to poison and everyone gains--

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.860
is it 2d10 temporary hit points?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.034
MATT: Go ahead and roll that now,
Jester, if you don't mind.

01:10:53.034 --> 01:10:54.967
TRAVIS: 2d10 temporary hit points?
MATT: Yes.

01:10:54.967 --> 01:10:55.992
SAM: She's rolling for us, or we roll--?

01:10:55.992 --> 01:10:58.189
MATT: She rolls, and then everybody gets the same number.

01:10:58.189 --> 01:11:01.100
LAURA: (drumming fingers) Okay.

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.160
LIAM: I might crack 80.
MARISHA: Yeah, dude.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.743
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

01:11:07.142 --> 01:11:08.460
(disappointed) Oh.

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.843
Nine extra points.

01:11:09.843 --> 01:11:11.218
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:11:11.218 --> 01:11:13.272
That's half Caleb's HP.

01:11:13.272 --> 01:11:17.680
(laughter)

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.830
TALIESIN: Wisdom saving throws.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.340
MATT: With a comfortable meal in your belly

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:25.200
and the surge of divine energy flowing through you,

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.800
protecting you, you get the after-meal sleepies.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.570
LAURA: You also can't be frightened.

01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:32.390
MATT: Yeah, sorry, also immune to fear. Useful.

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:34.660
MARISHA: So, wait, it's immune to fear, poison...

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:37.460
TRAVIS: Nine temporary hit points.
MARISHA: And advantage on...

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.730
LAURA: Wisdom saving throws.
MARISHA: Wisdom saves.

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:40.440
MATT: You've got it.
MARISHA: Clutch.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.560
MATT: Yeah, Heroes' Feast is legit.
MARISHA: While we eat...

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.390
Hang on.
MATT: Mm-hmm?

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:46.773
MARISHA: Hang on.

01:11:46.773 --> 01:11:51.756
Advantage Wis saves.

01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:54.563
Jester?
LAURA: Hm?

01:11:54.563 --> 01:11:56.080
MARISHA: How are you feeling about Traveler Con?

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.150
You know, if we defeat the looming volcano god

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.820
that has this entire island held hostage.

01:12:06.083 --> 01:12:07.943
LAURA: Um. (sighs)

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:10.316
MARISHA: You all right?

01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:14.910
I honestly thought that that was going to be, like,

01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:17.250
something that you'd start rattling off

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.760
a thousand ideas about, but you didn't say anything.

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.700
So now I'm super-concerned.

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:23.780
LAURA: I just don't, um...

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:25.021
I don't...

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.930
know...

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:36.585
I don't know what to do about it.

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:40.200
SAM: Like, whether or not to have it?

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.240
Or what to do when you do have it?

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:47.703
LAURA: Well.

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:56.423
Obviously, we're going to have it.

01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:59.151
But...

01:13:02.009 --> 01:13:03.351
the Traveler...

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:07.015
He doesn't want to be a god.

01:13:07.986 --> 01:13:08.969
He doesn't...

01:13:11.166 --> 01:13:12.374
He doesn't like it.

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:16.450
So I don't, um...

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.050
I don't know...

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:25.100
how to make everybody come here

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.380
and pretend like they're going to worship him...

01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:34.320
and also make him happy and also make sure

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.610
that they're not taken advantage of too much,

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:40.045
and also free everybody here.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.450
And also, at the end of it,

01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:48.375
if he doesn't want to be a god,

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.210
what does that mean for me and him?

01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:55.043
Or...

01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:59.602
I don't know. (sighs)

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.620
I don't know.

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:04.310
I was hoping maybe we will fight Vokodo

01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:06.618
and then everything will just become clear.

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:13.630
MARISHA: You seemed sad last night after you went off

01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:15.060
and talked to him for a bit.
LIAM: You're sad now.

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.110
LAURA: I am not sad now.

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:18.950
I'm just, you know.
MARISHA: Oh.

01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:21.910
Those are tears.
LAURA: No, I'm just, like...

01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:24.827
You know, it's just-- it's stressful.

01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:32.378
LIAM: What if it were just you and him, like your old days?

01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:35.540
LAURA: I don't think that's a bad thing.

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:39.281
You know? He--

01:14:42.899 --> 01:14:44.961
He was really wonderful then.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.178
He was my best friend.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.930
I know all of you are concerned

01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:56.170
that maybe he's taking advantage

01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:59.650
or he doesn't have our best interests.

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:01.780
Which who knows, maybe he doesn't.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:06.171
But, he really...

01:15:06.171 --> 01:15:09.213
got me through a lot when I was younger, you know?

01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:13.527
And he was all I had, really, and...

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.582
He was wonderful.

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:21.887
He taught me so much.

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:27.560
If it just was him being my friend again,

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.418
I'd be okay with that.

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.890
I just don't know what that means for everyone else,

01:15:34.890 --> 01:15:37.248
you know, all the people that are coming here.

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:41.530
TRAVIS: If he said he doesn't want to be a god,

01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:44.400
did he say why he's still having everyone come here?

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.307
MARISHA: Did he know about this place?

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:49.340
LAURA: He did.

01:15:51.610 --> 01:15:53.410
That was, um...

01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:55.048
kind of sad to find out about.

01:15:55.048 --> 01:15:56.731
He-- he knew that...

01:15:58.197 --> 01:16:00.755
people lost their memory here, apparently.

01:16:02.073 --> 01:16:04.210
(sniffs)

01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:08.593
Um. I think, you know...

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:13.650
I think he's hoping

01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:17.357
to sort of offload a lot of the people when they come.

01:16:17.357 --> 01:16:20.515
Maybe-- not necessarily leave them here,

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.750
but make them think that, you know,

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:27.193
he's not so available any more.

01:16:29.087 --> 01:16:30.795
It would be really stressful, you know,

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:33.487
to have all these people constantly praying to you.

01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:36.087
TRAVIS: But he sent you here.

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:40.710
LAURA: Yeah.

01:16:40.710 --> 01:16:42.642
TRAVIS: What if <i>you</i> forgot him?

01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:47.458
LAURA: He promised me that he would save me.

01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:51.603
And us. He said all of us.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.638
I believe him.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.907
ASHLEY: How do you feel about him right now,

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.077
knowing this, that he...

01:17:07.650 --> 01:17:11.200
I am very not trying to overstep at all,

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.610
but him knowing that he would bring people here,

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.093
that it's possible that they would forget?

01:17:20.650 --> 01:17:22.326
LAURA: (sighs shakily)

01:17:23.493 --> 01:17:26.743
(soft, ethereal music)

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:32.095
LAURA: He's not, like, the best guy. (laughs)

01:17:32.095 --> 01:17:34.070
You know, he's really cool.

01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:37.920
But I don't think he always, you know...

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:45.450
Thinks about other people,

01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:49.190
about how they'll actually be affected, sometimes.

01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:50.973
And that's just, you know,

01:17:50.973 --> 01:17:55.398
just because he's, you know,
super super powerful, and um...

01:17:56.383 --> 01:17:57.216
to us...

01:17:58.249 --> 01:18:00.340
and to him, we're like ants sometimes.

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:03.720
We don't think about the fact when we squish an ant.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.810
It doesn't mean anything to us,

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:08.297
but the ant is real sad.

01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:11.032
TRAVIS: Or it's dead.

01:18:13.710 --> 01:18:14.543
LAURA: Or dead.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:24.432
TRAVIS: Jester, we all want what's best for you, of course.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:26.970
Have you talked to him at all

01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:29.070
about going back to just the way things were

01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:31.720
when you were little, just he and you, as friends?

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.736
LAURA: I want to. I want to, I want to.

01:18:33.736 --> 01:18:35.750
It's just every time we talk

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:37.900
he has to disappear so fast.

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.907
Before, he used to be here all the time, you know?

01:18:42.055 --> 01:18:45.710
Ugh, it's so hard to share. (laughs)

01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:47.690
SAM: But you know where he'll be.

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:49.920
He'll be at Traveler Con.
LAURA: (sniffs) I know.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:50.980
He is going to be here.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:54.234
SAM: And the thing that you guys have all taught me

01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:58.010
is that friends call each other on their shit,

01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:59.350
and if they're really friends,

01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:01.720
then they'll be friends afterwards.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.920
And if you know where he'll be,

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.820
and you know he's not going to disappear,

01:19:05.966 --> 01:19:07.883
you should call him on his shit.

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:12.590
Traveler Con shouldn't be about bamboozling people

01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:14.830
or you trying to put on a show.

01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:17.590
Traveler Con should be about you and the Traveler.

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:20.277
That's how it all started.

01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:25.030
LAURA: But all those people are already on their way here.

01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:26.622
SAM: We'll deal with them after.

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:31.500
TRAVIS: You've done so much for him,

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.100
and I know he's done so much for you,

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.910
but trying to make him happy in this,

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:39.400
it puts you at risk.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.650
It has put you at risk, and us.

01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:46.070
That doesn't seem, like you said,

01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:47.430
the most considerate thing.

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.840
LIAM: Yeah, but also, it is complicated sometimes,

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.750
extracting yourself from the very things

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:58.210
that made you who you are.
LAURA: (sniffs)

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.168
So this might be difficult.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:04.566
MARISHA: We're protective of <i>you</i>,

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:07.630
and defensive of <i>you</i>.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:11.856
MARISHA: We're here because of Jester,
not because of the Traveler Con.

01:20:11.856 --> 01:20:14.790
(soft, pensive music)

01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:16.565
Honestly...

01:20:18.873 --> 01:20:20.864
all you have to do is say the word,

01:20:22.361 --> 01:20:24.420
and we'll do whatever you want.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.345
It's always been the case.

01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:29.415
But...

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:35.650
Also, if he hurts you, I'll kill him.

01:20:35.650 --> 01:20:37.138
You know? Like...

01:20:37.138 --> 01:20:38.830
we've killed demigods before.

01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:41.227
We're about to kill one.
We could kill him, too.

01:20:41.227 --> 01:20:42.738
LAURA: We don't-- I don't want to kill him.

01:20:42.738 --> 01:20:44.120
MARISHA: Yeah, but, you know, we could.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:48.895
And we would if you said the word.

01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:53.075
LAURA: Thank you, Beau.

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:55.855
I don't want to kill him.

01:20:57.610 --> 01:21:00.277
MARISHA: Just don't want to see you being used, either.

01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:04.330
LAURA: Yeah.

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:10.738
I don't want to be used.

01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:16.880
MARISHA: You know, you're kind of...

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.487
to echo Nott's point, you are like his peer now.

01:21:22.487 --> 01:21:23.860
LAURA: (laughing) No, I'm not.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:26.270
He can do so many things.

01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:28.450
He can bamf in and out whenever he wants to!

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.833
SAM: So can you.

01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:32.150
LAURA: I can't. I'm stuck here on this island.

01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:35.465
SAM: You can turn into things and fly, and you can...

01:21:36.713 --> 01:21:37.870
You've got a lot of powers.

01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:40.450
Look, you made us this amazing dinner out of nothing.

01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:42.266
LAURA: This is a really good dinner.
SAM: Yeah!

01:21:42.266 --> 01:21:43.450
TRAVIS: Quite good.
ASHLEY: It's a very good dinner.

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:44.980
I've never had pancakes before,

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:47.230
and this might be my favorite thing I've ever had.

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:49.540
TRAVIS: You really haven't touched your bugs much.

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:51.462
ASHLEY: Because I'm eating all the pancakes.

01:21:51.462 --> 01:21:53.837
TRAVIS: They're crawling, though, away.
SAM: You could roll them up.

01:21:53.837 --> 01:21:55.920
TALIESIN: I was about to say, if you roll them up, and...

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.960
ASHLEY: Best bug I've ever had.
(laughter)

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.320
MARISHA: I guess we're a little bit biased

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:05.760
because we've seen you do a lot more amazing things

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.118
than we've seen the Traveler do.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:22:08.118 --> 01:22:11.385
LAURA: Everything I do, all of it,

01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:13.822
is because of him.

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:17.727
MARISHA: Ah, give yourself some credit, too, though.

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:23.890
TRAVIS: And you care about people you know,

01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:25.473
about people you don't know.

01:22:26.505 --> 01:22:27.700
You cause chaos, but in the end,

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.200
you don't want to hurt people.

01:22:31.161 --> 01:22:32.710
You care.

01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:34.210
In many ways, you're much more

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:37.320
than he will probably ever be.

01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:43.430
MARISHA: It's super natural for
students to outgrow their teachers.

01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:45.548
I mean, look at me with Dairon.

01:22:46.951 --> 01:22:48.090
TRAVIS: (stammering)

01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:50.220
MARISHA: You know?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:53.610
MARISHA: Who's the teacher now?
LAURA: (laughs)

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.079
Yeah. You're way cooler.

01:22:58.079 --> 01:22:59.761
MARISHA: I-I-I know.

01:22:59.761 --> 01:23:03.080
And you're way cooler than the Traveler, in my opinion.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.201
SAM: Did we leave Dairon at our house, by the way?

01:23:05.201 --> 01:23:07.230
TRAVIS: (laughs)
SAM: Is she there for forever?

01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:08.490
No.
MARISHA: No, they're back in--

01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:12.070
SAM: Oh, okay.
MARISHA: -- in Zadash now, I think.

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:13.610
Or are they still in Rexx--?

01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:16.040
I don't know.
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:16.873
MARISHA: She's around.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.780
ASHLEY: Jester, I hope you know how special you are.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:28.315
Just you, even without the Traveler.

01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:36.995
We all think you're pretty amazing.

01:23:41.365 --> 01:23:44.073
LIAM: And so does he, to a certain extent, so perhaps...

01:23:45.298 --> 01:23:47.981
a little more time with you

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:51.263
will color his perspective instead of he coloring yours.

01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:55.923
LAURA: Thank you, guys.

01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:58.940
TRAVIS: Yeah. If you ever want it,

01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.640
there is life beyond the Traveler.

01:24:01.530 --> 01:24:02.621
We're here.

01:24:06.023 --> 01:24:07.254
LAURA: Wow.

01:24:08.787 --> 01:24:12.731
That's pretty great. Thanks! (laughs)

01:24:12.731 --> 01:24:14.652
Not going to lie, I feel pretty good right now.

01:24:14.652 --> 01:24:16.233
(laughter)

01:24:16.233 --> 01:24:17.341
TRAVIS: It's the pancakes.

01:24:17.341 --> 01:24:19.470
TALIESIN: I just want to say, you all just did so well.

01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:21.483
I'm so proud.
(laughter)

01:24:21.483 --> 01:24:23.250
MARISHA: Oh, thanks, yeah.
TALIESIN: Everybody was just--

01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:24.933
SAM: We pulled a Caduceus!
MARISHA: Yeah, we did!

01:24:24.933 --> 01:24:26.683
TALIESIN: You guys...
I just got to sit here and nod.

01:24:26.683 --> 01:24:28.070
It was amazing.
SAM: Wow!

01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:31.510
TALIESIN: Wisdom, wisdom, self-realization.

01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:33.988
A little more wisdom, some more self-realization.

01:24:33.988 --> 01:24:35.888
(laughter)
It was great.

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:40.060
MATT: Vilya, mouth still half-full with a pancake, goes,

01:24:41.312 --> 01:24:42.610
"I know I've only just met you,

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:45.013
"but this is a tight family.

01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:48.320
"Hold onto each other.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.310
"This is important."

01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:52.835
LIAM: I gently push my salad across towards Vilya.

01:24:54.230 --> 01:24:55.942
MATT: She eats more of her pancakes.

01:24:55.942 --> 01:24:57.737
(laughter)

01:24:57.737 --> 01:24:59.787
"I've had plenty of salad in recent years."

01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:03.760
LAURA: Have you ever had salad with sprinkles, though?

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.530
MATT: "There's sprinkles in that?

01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:08.420
"That's strange.
(laughter)

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.213
"That's unique."

01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:13.962
TALIESIN: Basically sugared croutons
when you get down to it.

01:25:13.962 --> 01:25:17.074
LAURA: Ugh.
MARISHA: Disneyland resort salad.

01:25:17.074 --> 01:25:19.760
TALIESIN: (laughs)

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.020
TRAVIS: Frosted Flakes in your salad.

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:23.419
MARISHA: Why are they shaped
like Mickey ears, these cucumbers?

01:25:23.419 --> 01:25:24.443
(laughter)

01:25:24.443 --> 01:25:26.547
TRAVIS: Frosted Mini Wheats.

01:25:26.547 --> 01:25:28.145
TALIESIN: How do you get an avocado to do that, even.

01:25:28.145 --> 01:25:30.495
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:25:30.495 --> 01:25:33.000
MATT: Well, the evening is yours to set up as you see fit,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.620
whether it be more things to get ready,

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.840
more conversations to have or setting up the dome

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.210
and whatever your preparation would be

01:25:38.210 --> 01:25:39.960
before a night's rest.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.960
LIAM: Yeah, I think I would set up the dome,

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:45.170
not on the deck, but...
MATT: Below deck?

01:25:45.170 --> 01:25:46.340
LIAM: Below deck.

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.748
And I will set up, uh...

01:25:49.961 --> 01:25:51.627
I won't set up the wire. There's no point to it.

01:25:51.627 --> 01:25:53.830
But what I will do is, eventually,

01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:55.820
whether this is in sequence now or later,

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:59.510
I'm going to take time to pull out the wand

01:25:59.510 --> 01:26:01.310
that Calianna gifted to me

01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:05.520
and set it down inside the dome and take out...

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.590
I have a handful of little bits of stained glass

01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:13.680
from our battle with the Laughing Hand.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.710
I'm just going to lay the wand down on the ground

01:26:15.710 --> 01:26:19.030
and spend, I don't know, maybe 30 minutes to an hour

01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:22.968
just sort of sliding different pieces of glass around,

01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:28.930
switching them out, and just pondering a thing.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.330
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's it.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.040
MATT: Anybody else need to do anything?

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.930
LAURA: Um.
TALIESIN: I'm just going to sit.

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:41.773
Meditate. Listen to the sound of the waterfall.

01:26:41.773 --> 01:26:43.510
MATT: All right.

01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:45.830
LAURA: Yes, I am going to do something.

01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:47.690
MATT: What you doing, Jester?

01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:50.990
LAURA: I'm going to go up to the front of the cavern

01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:53.520
where the waterfall is.
MATT: Okay.

01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:56.280
LAURA: Is there an object like a rock

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.946
or anything nearby the front of that cavern?

01:26:58.946 --> 01:27:00.413
Anything that I can...

01:27:00.413 --> 01:27:02.792
like, is there a boat that's close by?

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:07.080
MATT: There is a ship maybe about, begins

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.060
at 20 or so feet from the entranceway

01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.640
on the left side.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.260
If you're looking for a small rock,

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.918
like a handheld rock?
LAURA: Uh-huh.

01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:16.700
That would have a place to position

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:19.230
right near the cavern.
MATT: Okay, okay.

01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:21.940
Make an investigation check

01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:26.530
as you're rummaging through the nearby sand and dirt

01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:27.870
that has accumulated at the corner

01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:30.710
to see if there's any loose stone or rock that you can grab.

01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:32.610
LAURA: 11.
MATT: 11?

01:27:32.610 --> 01:27:33.650
Eh, it takes you a little bit,

01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:38.008
but you manage to find a piece of flaked-off obsidian

01:27:38.008 --> 01:27:41.458
from the inside of the rock cavern,

01:27:43.237 --> 01:27:45.320
or the volcanic rock, goes into an obsidian color.

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:46.153
But you pull it out.

01:27:46.153 --> 01:27:49.340
It's sharp on one edge, about that big, but you find one.

01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.790
LAURA: Do I still have Tongues up?

01:27:52.650 --> 01:27:54.110
MATT: Tongues lasts an hour, I believe?

01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:55.613
LAURA: It was only an hour?

01:27:55.613 --> 01:27:58.603
LIAM: (murmuring)

01:27:58.603 --> 01:28:00.534
(tutting)

01:28:00.534 --> 01:28:01.470
That is correct, one hour.

01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:03.010
MATT: So, no, that would be gone.
LAURA: Okay.

01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:12.170
Well, hopefully he'll recognize my voice.

01:28:12.170 --> 01:28:17.170
I'm going to cast, with my Rod of the Solitary Scout,

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:18.970
the wand that I have,

01:28:18.970 --> 01:28:20.750
I'm going to cast Magic Mouth.

01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:22.860
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: Okay.

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:24.620
LAURA: On the rock.
MATT: Okay.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.423
LAURA: And I'm going to say...

01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:35.534
Here they are, ready for the taking!

01:28:35.534 --> 01:28:36.715
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:28:36.715 --> 01:28:38.290
LAURA: And then I put it right at the edge,

01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:41.480
so that way, if the dragon turtle comes within range,

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.083
he'll hear it and be tempted to come on in.

01:28:44.083 --> 01:28:45.890
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:48.520
As you seal that vocal print into the stone,

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.130
it vibrates in your hand

01:28:50.130 --> 01:28:51.930
and you place it just in the proximity

01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:53.080
of where the illusion begins

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.500
and the actual opening for the cavern itself is held.

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:56.333
You feel pretty confident

01:28:56.333 --> 01:28:58.120
that a being of that size, if it were to come through,

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.710
would definitely trigger the radius for the spell.

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:01.493
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool, cool.

01:29:01.493 --> 01:29:03.376
MATT: All right? Anybody else?

01:29:04.336 --> 01:29:06.010
LIAM: A minor thing, I will also stay up

01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:07.300
at least an hour to

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.990
use components necessary to turn Frumpkin into an octopus,

01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:14.280
and I will just frisbee him out

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:17.750
off of the ship to patrol
while we are sleeping,

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:20.290
and to be more use, possibly, tomorrow.

01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:22.890
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: (imitating octopus)

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:24.930
Perfect. All right.

01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:27.340
Anybody else, or are we looking to a night's rest?

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.312
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I think we're doing it.
SAM: Rest.

01:29:29.312 --> 01:29:30.562
LAURA: (groaning)
MATT: Okay.

01:29:32.410 --> 01:29:33.870
You all gather into the dome.

01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:35.710
Are you doing your jade thing again,

01:29:35.710 --> 01:29:37.315
or leaving it as it was?

01:29:40.123 --> 01:29:41.431
LIAM: I cannot. I'm tapped.

01:29:41.431 --> 01:29:45.120
ASHLEY: Are we tying each other
together or is that a bad idea?

01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:48.043
TALIESIN: We can, uh...
LAURA: Let's do it.

01:29:48.043 --> 01:29:49.350
ASHLEY: Yeah?

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:50.183
TALIESIN: Just in case?

01:29:50.183 --> 01:29:51.499
MATT: So the jade thing,

01:29:51.499 --> 01:29:54.700
the plethora of images that you left the night before,

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:57.390
did help lower the DC of the check last time.

01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:58.330
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: But if you cannot do it,

01:29:58.330 --> 01:30:00.270
then we'll just go with whatever its standard is.

01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:02.920
No worries.
LIAM: I am tapped at that level.

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.030
MATT: That's okay. All right, then.

01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:07.150
All of you gather for the evening's rest.

01:30:07.150 --> 01:30:09.400
You're tying yourselves together with rope?

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.780
TRAVIS: I think we should, right?

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.830
TALIESIN: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:12.930
MATT: Who's affixed to who?

01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:14.840
Or is it everyone affixed to a singular piece of rope?

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.520
TALIESIN: No, we could--
LAURA: Yeah, just do this order.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:20.070
TRAVIS: We do the twice around your wrist,

01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:24.048
extend it six feet or more.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:30:24.048 --> 01:30:27.150
ASHLEY: We can take it off easily, but it'll wake us up.

01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:29.640
MATT: So it'll take, between all of you,

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.780
two sets of rope, I think.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.977
MATT: So you guys got that?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:30:32.977 --> 01:30:34.600
ASHLEY: Yes, I have some.
MATT: Cool.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:39.040
Placed, roped and resting,

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.530
you all eventually find yourselves to a night's sleep.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:46.380
The dreams range from nothing,

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:49.450
but just an evening of dark comfort,

01:30:49.450 --> 01:30:53.920
to images of past experiences, fuzzy.

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:57.753
Yasha.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:01.992
In the darkness,

01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:05.350
you still sense yourself sleeping,

01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:07.290
and consciously, you're like,

01:31:07.290 --> 01:31:08.990
"I'm having a hard time sleeping."

01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:10.260
The insomnia's kicked in,

01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.047
whether it be the nerves for the day before.

01:31:13.047 --> 01:31:14.590
(sighs) Should probably get up.

01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:15.940
And as you open your eyes,

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:18.937
it's just darkness before you.

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.930
Glancing ahead, trying to find something,

01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:25.630
you catch one little speck of light.

01:31:26.505 --> 01:31:29.680
(blowing softly)

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:32.310
A single white feather that seems to be drifting down.

01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:33.330
You're not laying on your side.

01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:35.720
You're sitting up, or at least it's drifting from an angle,

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.380
but it's coming straight down from your perspective,

01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:39.500
before it comes to rest on the ground.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.550
As it hits,
(popping)

01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:43.670
you see these ripples, like it hit the surface

01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:46.105
of a still, glass-like ocean.

01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:48.510
As the ripples go out...

01:31:50.977 --> 01:31:53.090
(thunder rumbling)

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:55.790
You see flashes of lightning in the distance,

01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:58.840
contained within clouds, a storm that sits on the horizon,

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.605
every horizon as you look around.

01:32:00.605 --> 01:32:02.652
It's just you and the feather.

01:32:02.652 --> 01:32:05.989
(thunder rumbling)

01:32:05.989 --> 01:32:09.939
The storm rolls and roars louder...

01:32:09.939 --> 01:32:11.039
and louder.

01:32:13.282 --> 01:32:14.557
What do you do?

01:32:17.670 --> 01:32:19.990
ASHLEY: Am I in the water?

01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.823
MATT: You glance down

01:32:20.823 --> 01:32:23.440
and you're standing on a similar surface,

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.950
though it feels hard.

01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:27.230
Doesn't seem to react to your footfalls.

01:32:27.230 --> 01:32:29.880
The ripples only came out from where the feather hit.

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.210
ASHLEY: Can I go towards the feather?

01:32:35.210 --> 01:32:37.240
MATT: Sure. You step.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.075
As you step from the place you were at--

01:32:39.075 --> 01:32:39.916
(footstep)

01:32:39.916 --> 01:32:42.890
your first footstep hits the water in front,

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:44.470
another ripple comes out.

01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:46.380
The storms--
(thunder rumbling)

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.618
rage even louder with that footstep.

01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:51.100
You take another.

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.058
Another ripple through the water.

01:32:53.058 --> 01:32:54.290
(thunder rumbling)

01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:56.900
The storm's getting closer and closer.

01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:59.270
The feather's about four feet from you,

01:32:59.270 --> 01:33:00.728
about as many footsteps.

01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:08.347
ASHLEY: I will keep walking towards it, and...

01:33:14.150 --> 01:33:16.441
I'll just-- I'll look around...

01:33:18.558 --> 01:33:21.649
and reach down to pick it up.

01:33:21.649 --> 01:33:22.990
MATT: Okay.

01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:25.270
With each rushing footstep,

01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:28.100
the storm gets louder and louder.

01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:29.550
As you reach towards it,

01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:31.867
there's a flash and an impact.

01:33:31.867 --> 01:33:32.700
(lightning striking)

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.230
You see this burst of energy

01:33:34.230 --> 01:33:36.280
beneath the surface of the water in front of you.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.730
Splashing water and mist spray your face,

01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:40.340
and instinctually, you pull away,

01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.200
the feather disturbed on the surface

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.490
and then coming to rest again.

01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:49.040
You hear the thunder rolling loud around you still,

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.140
and there's that strength for a moment fades,

01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:53.970
and that fear,

01:33:53.970 --> 01:33:58.090
that fear that sent you fleeing from your people,

01:33:58.090 --> 01:34:00.550
that fear that drove you westward,

01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:05.075
that same sense of being alone, inconsequential,

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:08.930
shackled with guilt,

01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:11.900
keeps you from reaching for that feather,

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.170
yet it still lies before you

01:34:13.170 --> 01:34:14.970
as the storm gets louder and louder.

01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:17.176
What do you do?

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.380
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to grab it again.

01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:29.655
MATT: Okay. Make a wisdom saving throw
for me if you don't mind.

01:34:31.050 --> 01:34:32.650
SAM: With advantage?
ASHLEY: With advantage.

01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:36.253
MATT: With advantage, because
technically, yeah, you do have it.

01:34:36.253 --> 01:34:37.762
MARISHA: Heroes' dreams.

01:34:37.762 --> 01:34:39.236
ASHLEY: (exhales) That was a one.

01:34:39.236 --> 01:34:41.310
TRAVIS: Saving throw, saving throw.

01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:47.220
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: 16. (sighs)

01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:52.220
As you're going, and initially about to turn,

01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:54.230
that fear filling your soul,

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:57.530
you spin around to look back towards the darkness,

01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:59.870
where you can see the storm is breaking behind you.

01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:02.610
It is more dangerous in front of you,

01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:06.785
and behind you there is promised respite and escape.

01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:11.430
In that moment, the thunder seems to form words.

01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:14.630
This rolling voice

01:35:14.630 --> 01:35:17.030
seems to come out of the storm itself that says,

01:35:19.002 --> 01:35:22.530
"Do not run from yourself.

01:35:24.730 --> 01:35:29.730
"Overcome what faltered,"
(thunder rumbling)

01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:35.360
"and rise stronger."
(thunder rumbling)

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.140
You turn back around, swallow hard,

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.780
and reach out and grab that feather,

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:48.270
and as you do, there's a brief moment as you grasp it

01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:53.252
that the air seems to buzz with energy.

01:35:53.252 --> 01:35:55.010
that the air seems to buzz with energy.

01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:58.000
That single moment where you sense the anticipation

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.130
before something happens, and you look up

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:06.130
just as a streaking blast of pure lightning energy--

01:36:06.134 --> 01:36:07.209
just as a streaking blast of pure lightning energy--

01:36:07.209 --> 01:36:08.670
(lightning crackling)
streaks down towards you.

01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:10.133
What do you do?

01:36:11.491 --> 01:36:13.090
ASHLEY: Hoh, um...

01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.823
I...

01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:24.840
I will look up at it and

01:36:27.810 --> 01:36:29.352
I will just say:

01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:36.892
I do not want this fear anymore.

01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:41.950
And I will stand there and wait for it to hit me.

01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:42.783
MATT: Okay.

01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:49.000
As you look up in that brief moment,

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:54.710
without hesitation, you embrace the coming bolt,

01:36:54.710 --> 01:36:59.710
and as it hits you, you just see white.

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:04.740
Your whole body vibrates with power,

01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:08.510
and for a moment you feel like every piece of your body

01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:11.012
is about to break apart and shatter.

01:37:13.730 --> 01:37:16.750
But it just stays at that threshold,

01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:18.610
and you embrace it.

01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:21.208
As the light begins to fade,

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:25.170
you can now see that dark abyss beneath you

01:37:25.170 --> 01:37:27.660
is alight with this faint blue glow,

01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:30.030
and beneath this glass-like surface,

01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:32.970
10, 20, it's hard to say, 100 feet down,

01:37:32.970 --> 01:37:37.958
it is just an endless underwater hillside scape

01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:41.440
of broken chain link,

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.925
tethered and tangled endlessly beneath you.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.330
As you look within your hand,

01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:49.647
you see you hold that single white feather,

01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:53.120
and you look back up into the clouds,

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.280
which now have swollen to encompass

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.710
the entire sky and horizon around you.

01:37:57.710 --> 01:38:01.772
There is a single hole in the sky above.

01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:05.320
The voice once more crackling through the storm says,

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.850
"Show me--"
(thunder rumbling)

01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:14.850
"You can be reborn."
(thunder rumbling)

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:24.244
ASHLEY: Okay.
(laughter)

01:38:24.244 --> 01:38:25.077
Um...

01:38:26.769 --> 01:38:27.810
(exhales)

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.550
I bamf out the wings.

01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:33.883
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
LIAM: Flex!

01:38:33.883 --> 01:38:36.430
LAURA: (clapping)
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:38.310
MATT: Your wings emerge,

01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:42.970
the withered, skeletal, bone-like black necrotic wings,

01:38:42.970 --> 01:38:46.440
the representation of your fallen self.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.390
The faint beginnings of those feathers you noticed

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:53.260
still there, clinging to life at the edge

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.376
of these almost...

01:38:55.376 --> 01:38:58.676
vestigial extensions of yourself,

01:38:58.676 --> 01:39:02.170
of your guilt, of the emotional turmoil

01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:04.612
that you hold and hoist upon your shoulders.

01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:08.710
And as you look up to the sky,

01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:13.160
you watch like flowers blossoming

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.900
on the extended branches of a tree

01:39:15.954 --> 01:39:17.790
in the beginning of spring,

01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:22.510
more feathers begin to emerge and fill,

01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:24.880
and emerge and fill.

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.280
And the darkness around you begins to glow,

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:32.280
lit like a lantern that billows and brightens

01:39:32.490 --> 01:39:36.710
as the wings become full, angelic.

01:39:36.710 --> 01:39:39.370
The light itself is white and blue,

01:39:39.370 --> 01:39:43.338
and you can see, between the feathers, little sparks

01:39:43.338 --> 01:39:47.620
(electricity sparking)
of energy.

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:52.742
As you look up towards that hole once more.

01:39:57.695 --> 01:39:58.528
ASHLEY: Um--

01:40:00.517 --> 01:40:01.684
MATT: You hear a voice.

01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:06.737
Female, familiar, distant, from below.

01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:14.548
You look down, and in the chains,

01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:23.268
you see a female form beckoning.

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:27.398
The words, you can't quite make out,

01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:29.965
but it's calling to you.

01:40:36.426 --> 01:40:38.333
ASHLEY: (exhales) Oh, god.

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.361
Okay, okay, okay.

01:40:43.361 --> 01:40:44.278
Um...

01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:52.065
MATT: It sounds very much like Zuala.

01:40:52.065 --> 01:40:53.657
ASHLEY: (exhales)

01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:57.143
Um...

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.150
I crouch down,

01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:06.513
and I put my hand out.

01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:10.070
MATT: It breaks the surface.

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:14.283
And you sense you could...

01:41:15.291 --> 01:41:16.124
go.

01:41:24.121 --> 01:41:25.754
ASHLEY: (exhales)

01:41:31.224 --> 01:41:33.063
(sighs)

01:41:33.063 --> 01:41:34.763
(whispered) I have to go.

01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:40.085
And I'll leap. Leap up.

01:41:40.085 --> 01:41:41.350
TRAVIS: (inhaling sharply)

01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:43.057
MATT: As you withdraw your hand

01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:49.010
and alter your stance into a crouch as the wings unfurl,

01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:53.900
preparing to take their first beat, the voice says,

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.366
"I'm proud of you.

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:03.320
"Don't let me be a shackle."

01:42:05.808 --> 01:42:09.810
(beating wings)

01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:12.430
And with renewed strength you've not felt

01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:16.970
from an extension beyond your own arms,

01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:19.040
you fight your way up into the storm,

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.288
this tunnel around you of lightning flashing.

01:42:21.288 --> 01:42:22.540
(furious lightning)

01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:23.373
All around you.

01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:26.630
Forcing your way up as high as you can

01:42:26.630 --> 01:42:29.388
until eventually you break past the clouds.

01:42:29.388 --> 01:42:30.570
(rushing air)

01:42:30.570 --> 01:42:35.548
Up into a night sky of stars, and two moons.

01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:41.010
As you look back down, the hole closes.

01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:43.508
The clouds become mist,

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:48.683
and as the mist fades, you're looking down upon...

01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:55.837
land masses, water, Exandria.

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:04.330
And it's a freedom you've not quite felt before,

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:07.332
like you could go anywhere.

01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:13.879
As morning comes to you all.

01:43:13.879 --> 01:43:18.879
(exhaling)
(laughter)

01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:24.310
You all wake up well-rested.

01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:26.000
A little churny in the stomach

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.880
based on the maybe not (laughs) balanced meal

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.550
many of you enjoyed the night before.

01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:33.650
Except for Caleb.
LIAM: I'm fine.

01:43:33.650 --> 01:43:36.480
MATT: Caleb's fine.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.490
But you wake up.

01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:39.670
Well, you would know what time it is.

01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:41.110
LIAM: Would I?

01:43:41.110 --> 01:43:43.852
MATT: You have no sense of-- There is no sun around you.

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.100
You guys slept relatively early,

01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:50.850
so you're waking up now at about dawn.

01:43:50.850 --> 01:43:54.910
So it's about 5:30 or so in the morning.

01:43:56.136 --> 01:43:57.280
But it's still dark on the inside,

01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.040
but consciousness takes you.

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.608
You wake up, the day is yours.

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:06.760
TRAVIS: The day is ours? Oh.

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.720
SAM: Everybody know who they are?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.130
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: Yeah.

01:44:10.130 --> 01:44:12.433
So I'd like everyone to make Wisdom saving throws, please.

01:44:12.433 --> 01:44:13.266
TRAVIS: Oh.
(laughter)

01:44:13.266 --> 01:44:14.850
ASHLEY: I'll forget what happened last night.

01:44:14.850 --> 01:44:17.328
MATT: ♪ False sense of security. ♪

01:44:17.328 --> 01:44:18.310
TALIESIN: With advantage.
LAURA: With advantage.

01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:19.460
SAM: With advantage?
MATT: With advantage,

01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:21.543
because of Heroes' Feast.

01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:27.290
MARISHA: I'm okay.

01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:28.940
TRAVIS: That's off.
TALIESIN: Eesh.

01:44:31.210 --> 01:44:32.460
TRAVIS: 16.
MATT: 16.

01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:33.810
LAURA: 22.
MATT: 22.

01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:34.920
LIAM: 15.
MATT: 15.

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.200
SAM: 23.
MATT: 23.

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.390
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: 16.

01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:38.550
TALIESIN: 21.
MATT: 21.

01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:39.812
MARISHA: 16.
MATT: 16.

01:44:39.812 --> 01:44:40.690
(groaning)

01:44:40.690 --> 01:44:41.850
LAURA: Right on this cusp, I think.

01:44:41.850 --> 01:44:43.997
TRAVIS: He's got to roll, though.
MATT: For Vilya.

01:44:43.997 --> 01:44:45.297
SAM: For Vilya.

01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:49.490
MATT: So...
(paper rustling)

01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:53.441
Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah?

01:44:53.441 --> 01:44:54.750
SAM: Oh.

01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:57.360
MATT: You're the only person that missed by one.

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.207
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:01.580
MATT: When you come to consciousness,

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:05.390
everyone looks around and you look around,

01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:08.880
taking stock of the friends around you.

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.620
It's Fjord, Jester, Veth, Caduceus,

01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:17.410
Beauregard, Yasha, Vilya.

01:45:17.410 --> 01:45:19.285
Good. You remember all that.

01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:23.598
Why are we here?

01:45:26.346 --> 01:45:27.620
There was something you're supposed to be doing here.

01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:28.860
There's ships around you,

01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:30.915
and you came to an island.

01:45:30.915 --> 01:45:32.520
But why? Why were you here?

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:36.020
And you immediately recognize consciously, like, "Oh no."

01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:38.130
Oh no. With your intelligence and self-awareness,

01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:39.680
you know exactly what happened.

01:45:41.011 --> 01:45:43.840
LIAM: So, self-aware of the fact that--

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.400
MATT: Because of your high intelligence

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.400
and the preparation you guys have done,

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:51.520
you forgetting things, they're fuzzy,

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.520
and you being you, can acknowledge that something's wrong.

01:45:56.933 --> 01:45:58.060
LAURA: (chuckling)

01:45:58.060 --> 01:45:59.220
MATT: You don't quite understand what,

01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:01.050
but just something's not right.

01:46:01.050 --> 01:46:01.883
LIAM: I don't...

01:46:01.883 --> 01:46:02.716
I'm...

01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:06.600
You know, I'm a little bit off.

01:46:07.530 --> 01:46:09.088
In a good mood, though.

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.160
SAM: You're in a <i>good</i> mood?

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.590
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, then something's definitely off.

01:46:13.590 --> 01:46:15.415
LAURA: Oh, yeah, we better definitely--

01:46:15.415 --> 01:46:16.248
TRAVIS: Tackle him!

01:46:16.248 --> 01:46:19.178
No, I'm just kidding.
(laughter)

01:46:20.350 --> 01:46:23.036
TALIESIN: Which of us wants to take it?

01:46:23.036 --> 01:46:25.900
LAURA: Boulder, Parchment, Shears?
TALIESIN: Boulder, Paper, Shears?

01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:27.731
TRAVIS: Three-way.
MATT: "Certainly.

01:46:27.731 --> 01:46:29.690
"I haven't played this since I was a little girl.

01:46:29.690 --> 01:46:31.475
"Okay, okay."
LAURA: All right.

01:46:31.475 --> 01:46:34.510
MATT: "All right. On three, or three then?"

01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:35.980
LIAM: What are we doing?
LAURA: On three.

01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:38.120
TALIESIN: On three.
LAURA: Okay.

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:40.225
LIAM: <i>Eins, zwei, drei</i>.

01:46:40.225 --> 01:46:41.058
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Wow!

01:46:41.058 --> 01:46:43.090
ASHLEY: Oh my god!
TRAVIS: Go again.

01:46:44.127 --> 01:46:45.760
SAM: Three-way.

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.170
LAURA: (groaning)
TRAVIS: You're out.

01:46:47.170 --> 01:46:48.240
LAURA: Oh, wait, that means I lost,

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:49.820
so I should use my spell slot.

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.390
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: "Yes."

01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:52.223
LAURA: Hi, Caleb.

01:46:52.223 --> 01:46:54.010
LIAM: What are we doing?
LAURA: How are you doing today?

01:46:54.010 --> 01:46:56.950
LIAM: Doing so--
LAURA: I cast Greater Restoration.

01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:58.550
MATT: Suddenly, all the memories rush back to you.

01:46:58.550 --> 01:47:03.200
You feel that strange alteration is ejected,

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:05.730
like some foreign substance in your lungs,

01:47:05.730 --> 01:47:07.360
but from your mind instead,

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.760
like mentally coughing it

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.050
from the inside of your brain,

01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:12.420
and then suddenly, oh, you're fine.

01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:13.720
You're fine, you're fine.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:16.060
LIAM: I had a very tall, erect spine,

01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:17.980
and it just went a little... (groans)

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:20.780
LAURA: Oh, he's back, you guys.
(laughter)

01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:22.820
ASHLEY: Oh no!
TRAVIS: Oh, everything sucks.

01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:24.180
(laughter)

01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:25.640
SAM: You were smiling for a second!

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.290
LAURA: You were happy.
SAM: Aww.

01:47:27.290 --> 01:47:29.280
LIAM: It happens sometimes.
SAM: It looked really weird.

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.800
TALIESIN: We knew you wouldn't like it.

01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:33.880
LIAM: Thank you.
LAURA: You're welcome.

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.997
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> Better this way.

01:47:37.290 --> 01:47:38.760
TRAVIS: Yes.
(laughter)

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:39.920
SAM: Was that a question?
TALIESIN: For now.

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.800
TRAVIS: Period. Right?
LIAM: Yeah?

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:44.770
LAURA: You're much taller than I realized.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.880
LIAM: Yeah, I'm, you know,

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:49.552
average human height.

01:47:49.552 --> 01:47:51.640
MATT: I would also like everybody
to make an investigation check, please.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.161
LAURA: Oh, man.
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:47:56.450 --> 01:48:00.080
TRAVIS: 18.
MATT: 18, all right. Jester?

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:00.970
LAURA: 10.
MATT: 10.

01:48:00.970 --> 01:48:03.280
LIAM: 22.
SAM: 30.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.000
ASHLEY: 22.
TRAVIS: 30!

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.530
TALIESIN: Two.
ASHLEY: 30?

01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:08.870
MARISHA: 22.
MATT: You said two, Caduceus?

01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:09.703
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:48:09.703 --> 01:48:13.910
MATT: All right, if I could have Caduceus and Jester.

01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:17.850
Pick something of your inventory that just is gone.

01:48:17.850 --> 01:48:18.900
You forgot it.

01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:20.332
You don't know where you put it, it's weird.

01:48:20.332 --> 01:48:21.730
TALIESIN: Oh...
LAURA: I don't even know

01:48:21.730 --> 01:48:22.840
what this stuff is for.

01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:25.190
I have all these things listed.

01:48:25.190 --> 01:48:27.640
SAM: Yeah, I have a bunch of things in my inventory

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:31.055
that I'm like, "Wait, what?"
(laughter)

01:48:31.055 --> 01:48:34.100
LAURA: I don't think I would ever realize it was missing.

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:34.970
TRAVIS: At some point I was like,

01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:38.450
"You definitely need that."
LAURA: A belt with a key on it.

01:48:39.330 --> 01:48:41.478
I don't know!
MATT: Sure, it's gone.

01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:44.090
MARISHA: Belt with a key?
LAURA: Yep.

01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:46.150
TRAVIS: It's a belt with a key attached to it?

01:48:46.150 --> 01:48:47.218
LAURA: Yep.
LIAM: Every day, it's got to be like,

01:48:47.218 --> 01:48:48.648
"(sighs) Another ball bearing."

01:48:48.648 --> 01:48:49.655
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:48:49.655 --> 01:48:51.230
MATT: You're going to get back to the Xhorhaus

01:48:51.230 --> 01:48:53.604
and be like, (huffing)

01:48:53.604 --> 01:48:56.544
ASHLEY: How do we get in there?
(laughter)

01:48:56.544 --> 01:48:58.110
TRAVIS: It's got a hell of a lost and found section.

01:48:58.110 --> 01:48:59.040
MATT: Oh, yeah, very much so.

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.810
Rosohna's pretty on top of it there.

01:49:02.996 --> 01:49:06.283
LAURA: I'm down to 200G-worth of residuum.

01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:10.250
MATT: But the morning is yours for prep,

01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:11.590
if you wanted to try and speak to

01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:13.210
your friend, Dieter.

01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:15.680
MARISHA: And there's no sign of Dieter?

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:19.530
TALIESIN: Let's talk about this because

01:49:19.530 --> 01:49:21.413
they asked us a question.

01:49:21.413 --> 01:49:24.060
We should be able to answer it with something reasonable.

01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:28.460
LAURA: Yeah, why? He said, "Why should I believe you?"

01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:31.930
Or something.
MATT: That's the idea behind it.

01:49:31.930 --> 01:49:34.400
SAM: Yeah, because we're enemies, right?

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.430
Why should he trust us?

01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:37.790
This could be a trap for him.
LAURA: That's true.

01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:39.360
MARISHA: It definitely is a trap for him.

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:43.220
SAM: I think you should be honest.

01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:45.270
Caduceus always recommends honesty.

01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:47.900
Just say, "We have a beef,

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:52.900
"but you'd be pissing off one of my enemies."

01:49:53.725 --> 01:49:54.566
LAURA: That's true.

01:49:54.566 --> 01:49:55.690
TRAVIS: Maybe we want to make amends

01:49:55.690 --> 01:49:58.350
for our previous transgressions.

01:49:58.350 --> 01:50:01.392
SAM: Yeah, we did turn him into a little thing.

01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:06.850
LIAM: Maybe you could say we
want to sail out of here unscathed.

01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:09.850
LAURA: I've got 25 words, you guys,

01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:12.544
and you know I already have issues.

01:50:12.544 --> 01:50:15.377
(laughter)

01:50:16.590 --> 01:50:18.090
MARISHA: I kind of like the beef angle.

01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:21.540
LAURA: We know you like beef...
(laughter)

01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:22.373
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:25.830
LAURA: We got you beef...
SAM: Beau loves the beef angle.

01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:28.496
LIAM: That's such a loaded statement.

01:50:28.496 --> 01:50:31.560
(laughter)

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.230
MARISHA: Yeah, like, "Look, yeah, we hate you.

01:50:35.230 --> 01:50:38.522
"But congratulations, we hate someone else more than you."

01:50:38.522 --> 01:50:40.860
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:50:42.730 --> 01:50:43.763
Sending.

01:50:45.490 --> 01:50:46.706
TRAVIS: Send it!

01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:51.724
LAURA: Look.
TRAVIS: Good usage.

01:50:51.724 --> 01:50:52.710
(laughter)

01:50:52.710 --> 01:50:54.950
Every word.
LIAM: Total filler word.

01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:57.610
MARISHA: Great start.
SAM: (like Jester) Here's the deal.

01:50:58.930 --> 01:51:02.270
LIAM: (like Jester) Basically...
(laughter)

01:51:03.217 --> 01:51:06.298
ASHLEY: (like Jester) Hello!
LIAM: (like Jester) Okay, okay, okay, okay...

01:51:06.298 --> 01:51:09.048
(laughter)

01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:14.898
LAURA: We didn't get off on the right foot. But...

01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:26.260
This other guy, way worse than you.

01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:30.573
We like him less.

01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:33.310
That was four words, we like him less.

01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:34.260
TRAVIS: We like him...

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:37.952
We like him less.
LAURA: Him less.

01:51:37.952 --> 01:51:39.060
(laughter)

01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:40.798
TRAVIS: Didn't say I was very good at this.

01:51:40.798 --> 01:51:42.240
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:44.480
LIAM: Bring it home.

01:51:51.230 --> 01:51:54.077
LAURA: So you should fuck him.

01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:57.009
TRAVIS: <i>Fuck</i> him?
MARISHA: Fuck him?

01:51:57.009 --> 01:51:58.644
LAURA: Fuck him!

01:51:58.644 --> 01:51:59.477
Like, fuck him!

01:51:59.477 --> 01:52:00.740
Like, fuck him over!

01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:01.610
You know, fuck him.

01:52:01.610 --> 01:52:04.825
MARISHA: Wow, that Tongues spell really got to you.

01:52:04.825 --> 01:52:06.945
(laughter)

01:52:06.945 --> 01:52:08.650
You said fuck him in Zemnian.

01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:10.600
That's crazy!
LAURA: Well, it's, you know...

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:13.060
Oh, I should've used the Tongues thing again.

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:14.890
LIAM: You could have.
LAURA: Fuck.

01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:16.800
SAM: You've got more spells.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:18.300
SAM: Has he replied?
LAURA: Not yet.

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:22.192
MATT: Okay. Roll a persuasion check.

01:52:23.406 --> 01:52:25.189
LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:26.420
MATT: This has been building up to this.

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:28.740
The conversation's been leading to an actual ask

01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:31.990
that made sense to him, somewhat.

01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:35.000
Roll a persuasion check.
SAM: I will bless you.

01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:37.120
LAURA: Can you do that?
SAM: No.

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:40.040
LAURA: Can I guide myself?
MATT: Hmm.

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.232
LAURA: Not after.
MATT: It's not after, no.

01:52:41.232 --> 01:52:44.280
LIAM: It's happening, it's not like an active--

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:47.015
LAURA: Oh, god.
LIAM: Come on.

01:52:50.151 --> 01:52:52.740
LAURA: Oh!

01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:54.550
19?
MARISHA: (exclaiming)

01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:58.810
MATT: 19?
LAURA: N-n-n-nineteen!

01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:06.027
MATT: The response comes after a moment, and goes,

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.080
"We had discussed,

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:17.560
"I don't need a mate."

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:20.741
LAURA: (laughs)
TRAVIS: Oh no. Oh no.

01:53:24.583 --> 01:53:28.310
MATT: "No, thank you."
LAURA: Aw, man.

01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:30.968
Do I have to send him another message?

01:53:30.968 --> 01:53:32.003
(groans)

01:53:32.003 --> 01:53:33.167
Another message.

01:53:33.167 --> 01:53:36.130
I don't mean sex!

01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:39.980
Fuck him over! Destroy his shit!

01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:43.158
Come get his boats! He sucks!

01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:49.480
There's lots of them.

01:53:52.530 --> 01:53:55.193
We can make amends.
SAM: Hey!

01:53:56.727 --> 01:53:58.328
MATT: (laughs) Roll one more persuasion check.

01:53:58.328 --> 01:53:59.710
LAURA: Oh, balls!

01:53:59.710 --> 01:54:02.513
SAM: I will bless you again. (laughs)

01:54:02.513 --> 01:54:04.130
LAURA: I really should've cast something on--

01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:06.310
Shit! Okay, here we go, here we go.

01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:08.155
Here I go.
(laughter)

01:54:08.155 --> 01:54:11.658
LAURA: (sighing)

01:54:11.658 --> 01:54:13.191
Oh, motherfuck.

01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:16.160
15?
SAM: Ooh, not terrible.

01:54:20.603 --> 01:54:22.800
MATT: The response does not utilize

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:24.270
the plethora of words at its disposal.

01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:25.603
It just says,

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:30.370
"I'm good."
(groaning)

01:54:30.370 --> 01:54:31.330
That first roll was so close.

01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:32.340
That first roll was so close!

01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:35.330
I'm so sorry!
MARISHA: (sighs)

01:54:36.415 --> 01:54:37.598
Shit.

01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:41.002
SAM: Let's try three more times.

01:54:41.002 --> 01:54:42.930
(laughter)

01:54:42.930 --> 01:54:44.968
TRAVIS: "When you say you're good...

01:54:44.968 --> 01:54:46.870
(laughter)
"You mean..."

01:54:47.775 --> 01:54:49.843
SAM and LAURA: (huffing)
ASHLEY: "Does that mean you're coming, or...?"

01:54:49.843 --> 01:54:54.561
SAM: Our foolproof plan.
MARISHA: Fuck, it was pretty good.

01:54:54.561 --> 01:54:55.394
MATT: It was a good plan.

01:54:55.394 --> 01:54:59.740
It was a tough sell, and it just didn't work out. I'm sorry.

01:55:02.464 --> 01:55:04.014
LAURA: (humming)
TRAVIS: That's okay.

01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:07.290
SAM: What's our second plan?
TRAVIS: I'm having breakfast.

01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:13.580
We're good. We're going to make our way in.

01:55:13.590 --> 01:55:15.130
SAM: If we go in the back way,

01:55:15.130 --> 01:55:18.800
he'll know something's up immediately.

01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:19.680
ASHLEY: Yeah, what are we going to say?

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:22.118
Like, we were just exploring the island?

01:55:22.118 --> 01:55:23.849
LAURA: Yeah, we're just exploring.

01:55:23.849 --> 01:55:25.340
What difference does it make? We'll bring him stuff.

01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:27.695
SAM: I think some of us should go in the front.

01:55:27.695 --> 01:55:28.950
TRAVIS: How do we get over there quickly?

01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:30.890
SAM: Vilya can take us over there quickly.

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:33.450
LAURA: That's wasting so many spells
before we even get in there.

01:55:33.450 --> 01:55:35.210
I've just wasted three fucking spells

01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:36.670
before we even got in.
SAM: If we go in the back, what are we doing?

01:55:36.670 --> 01:55:39.310
Like, "Hey, we're here to surprise you

01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:41.340
"with more gifts from your back door

01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:42.750
"that you told us not to use!"

01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:43.930
LAURA: He knows we're here already.

01:55:43.930 --> 01:55:46.030
LIAM: Already knows we're here, yeah.

01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:48.740
LAURA: He knows that Caduceus
already got sucked into the hole.

01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:49.740
We know the hole is there.

01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:51.060
We can be like, "Well, you know,

01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:52.530
"we didn't want to have to go all the way around

01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:53.540
"so we came this way."

01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:54.750
MATT: "I can try and continue

01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:56.930
"to play the position I've had with him

01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:59.160
"since I've arrived and play it off

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:01.340
"as some sort of additional delivery.

01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:03.180
"He did seem to be really into

01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:04.900
"some of the things you were carrying."

01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:07.635
TRAVIS: (with a mouth full of food) I, um--

01:56:07.635 --> 01:56:10.890
These scones are so good.
SAM: (laughs)

01:56:10.890 --> 01:56:13.390
I kind of took my sword back,

01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:18.040
so if he sees me, I don't think he'll be too pleased.

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:20.740
SAM: You can disguise yourself.
LIAM: He sees you right now.

01:56:21.967 --> 01:56:23.894
TRAVIS: Don't we think he'll see through that stuff?

01:56:23.894 --> 01:56:24.819
LAURA: (unsure noise)
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:56:24.819 --> 01:56:27.560
TRAVIS: You're right, it won't work.
LAURA: Give it a try.

01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:29.920
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:30.897
SAM: Make yourself look like Terra.

01:56:30.897 --> 01:56:33.280
LAURA: Hey, you could also do the astral dreadnought thing.

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:37.497
TRAVIS: I'll make myself look like Lukash.

01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:39.952
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Mask of Many Faces.

01:56:39.952 --> 01:56:40.943
(pulsing magic)

01:56:40.943 --> 01:56:42.650
MATT: You take on the full orcish form

01:56:42.650 --> 01:56:46.020
of the surprisingly debonair Lukash.

01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:50.190
TRAVIS: Full orc. Yeah.
TALIESIN: I'm not going to argue.

01:56:50.190 --> 01:56:52.842
It's a look.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:56:52.842 --> 01:56:54.010
I forget what he sounds like.

01:56:54.010 --> 01:56:55.660
Maybe I'll just nod.

01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:01.670
LAURA: Well, he probably doesn't talk to Vokodo anyway,

01:57:01.670 --> 01:57:02.840
and Vokodo can't hear people,

01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:05.210
so he doesn't know what he sounds like anyway.

01:57:05.210 --> 01:57:08.000
TALIESIN: In theory, he may have
just watched you change form.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.970
So. (clears throat)
LAURA: (laughs)

01:57:09.970 --> 01:57:11.550
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Maybe.

01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:14.410
Maybe he was paying attention to something else at the time.

01:57:14.410 --> 01:57:15.810
SAM: Maybe he just knows our position,

01:57:15.810 --> 01:57:18.420
but doesn't see our every move.

01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:21.557
MARISHA: Yeah. We're like beacons on a map.

01:57:21.557 --> 01:57:22.447
SAM: Yeah.

01:57:22.447 --> 01:57:25.700
MATT: Vilya nods and is like,

01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:29.300
"He doesn't seem to be aware
of the goings on in the village,

01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:31.032
"or any specifics.

01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:33.970
"Vokodo has previously been prone

01:57:33.970 --> 01:57:36.802
"to ask what's been happening.

01:57:38.227 --> 01:57:41.030
"So there might be something to that."

01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:42.140
TALIESIN: We could be just as shocked

01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:43.740
coming through there as anybody.

01:57:45.104 --> 01:57:46.300
LAURA: How'd we get here?!

01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:48.910
(babbling)
SAM: Oh, wow.

01:57:48.910 --> 01:57:49.743
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

01:57:49.743 --> 01:57:51.590
ASHLEY: Exploring, and one of us got pulled through,

01:57:51.590 --> 01:57:52.423
and we followed, and...

01:57:52.423 --> 01:57:54.740
SAM: This isn't the bathroom. What?

01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:57.480
MARISHA: We took eight wrong turns!
TALIESIN: Little more together for it,

01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:00.692
and here we are.
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

01:58:00.692 --> 01:58:01.933
SAM: Okay, okay.

01:58:01.933 --> 01:58:04.270
LIAM: He at least knows where we are.

01:58:04.270 --> 01:58:05.660
He knows that an offering

01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:08.102
that Fjord has made has been withdrawn.

01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:12.920
We are in a place, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:16.107
where islanders have been forbidden to go.

01:58:17.650 --> 01:58:19.700
MATT: This island?
LIAM: No, this area.

01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:21.500
MATT: Oh, this area's been forbidden, yeah.

01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:22.680
LAURA: But he already knows we're here.

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:23.513
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

01:58:23.513 --> 01:58:25.200
I'm just, I guess, lamenting the fact

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.350
that Dieter did not come.

01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:29.830
LAURA: Yeah, well, I'm lamenting that, too.

01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:31.890
LIAM: We're not in a great position.

01:58:31.890 --> 01:58:33.840
SAM: Just to throw it out there,

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.840
it's not a good plan.

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:36.800
You're going to say no,

01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:38.100
but I'm just going to throw it out there anyway.

01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:39.560
TRAVIS: Here it comes. Let's have it.

01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:42.110
SAM: Dieter was going to be lured here

01:58:42.110 --> 01:58:46.730
to destroy some ships and draw out Vokodo.

01:58:46.730 --> 01:58:50.760
Why do we need Dieter to destroy some ships?

01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:52.791
Couldn't we just blow up some fuckin' ships?

01:58:52.791 --> 01:58:53.970
TRAVIS: What would we use to blow up--

01:58:53.970 --> 01:58:56.580
Oh no.
MARISHA: I was going to suggest,

01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:58.380
maybe we keep the, like,

01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:00.770
find something else that's big and bad

01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:02.540
and likes to fight things thing

01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:04.550
and polymorph it and take it in with us.

01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:09.110
Like, we could go get one of those creepy panther things.

01:59:09.110 --> 01:59:09.943
I don't know.

01:59:09.943 --> 01:59:12.560
I'm trying to preserve the plan.

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:14.350
SAM: Or we could just burn all the ships with fire.

01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:17.640
LAURA: What if we bust out the ceiling on here?

01:59:18.732 --> 01:59:21.960
SAM: Oh. And just make it rain rocks?

01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:24.360
LAURA: See how many ships we can take out with that.

01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:26.060
SAM: How do we do that?

01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:28.070
LAURA: I would think we would do it from above,

01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:30.332
because if we're down here, woof.

01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:33.820
SAM: But, like, with what?

01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:36.255
TRAVIS: If you blew up two of the ships with--

01:59:36.255 --> 01:59:37.723
Do you have any of your--

01:59:37.723 --> 01:59:38.556
I don't want to say it.

01:59:38.556 --> 01:59:40.510
SAM: I've got some things.
TRAVIS: Right.

01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:43.600
We could see if he's going to come out of his nest.

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:47.680
If not, question answered.

01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:51.330
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: We could try and find

01:59:51.330 --> 01:59:54.130
a great white in the ocean?

01:59:54.130 --> 01:59:55.900
TRAVIS: Sorry, what?
MARISHA: A shark.

01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:57.517
TRAVIS: You were going to go
fishing for a great white shark?

01:59:57.517 --> 01:59:59.072
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:59:59.072 --> 02:00:00.121
TRAVIS: Do you have a good charter

02:00:00.121 --> 02:00:02.380
that knows where the great white shark hunting ground...

02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:04.520
MARISHA: You tell me, Captain Tusktooth.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:05.644
TRAVIS: They're not around here.

02:00:05.644 --> 02:00:09.344
MARISHA: Do we-- I'm trying to preserve the Dieter plan.

02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:13.055
The Derek Dieter plan.
SAM: We could be Dieter.

02:00:13.055 --> 02:00:14.180
You can be a great white shark.

02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:15.120
TRAVIS: Oh, you were going to do like,

02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.330
"Here, Dieter, Dieter, Dieter!"

02:00:16.330 --> 02:00:18.520
with a great white shark or something?

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:22.470
MARISHA: No, like, "Here, Guaca, Guaca, Guacamole!"

02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:23.830
But with a great white shark.

02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:24.663
I don't know.

02:00:24.663 --> 02:00:27.340
I'm trying to figure it out, man!

02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:28.881
I'm sad about Dieter too.

02:00:28.881 --> 02:00:30.160
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm with you.

02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:32.850
TALIESIN: We're all sad about Dieter.
MARISHA: We're all sad about Dieter.

02:00:32.850 --> 02:00:34.450
LAURA: Sorry, you guys.

02:00:34.450 --> 02:00:35.800
MARISHA: No, he sucks.

02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:36.633
TRAVIS: You had the idea.

02:00:36.633 --> 02:00:39.240
That was more than we had.
ASHLEY: It was a very good idea,

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:41.560
MARISHA: And further proof that he should really get laid.

02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:43.020
TALIESIN: Yeah, you tried to invite him to a party.

02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:45.010
It was his decision not to come.

02:00:45.010 --> 02:00:47.926
SAM: Should I light a ship on fire?

02:00:47.926 --> 02:00:48.940
TRAVIS: I think we should probably blow up

02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:51.990
at least two of them, yeah.
MARISHA: Let's destroy some ships.

02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:53.990
I like it.
LAURA: However.

02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:56.930
LIAM: We're not at all worried that he's going to

02:00:56.930 --> 02:00:59.117
unleash the volcano's wrath in retribution?

02:00:59.117 --> 02:01:00.562
ASHLEY: I was just going to say.
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.

02:01:00.562 --> 02:01:05.120
LAURA: Also, if we do that, then we can't play off the idea

02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:06.900
of Vilya going in and saying, like,

02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:09.360
"Yeah, we're here to offer you some more things."

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.393
That's out the window.

02:01:11.393 --> 02:01:13.820
SAM: All right, well then let's follow that plan.

02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:15.980
Say we go in the back door with Vilya saying,

02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:18.330
"Hey, we came in the back door to give you prizes."

02:01:18.330 --> 02:01:19.447
Then what?

02:01:19.447 --> 02:01:20.288
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:01:20.288 --> 02:01:22.760
SAM: Do we give him something, or do we just attack?

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:27.540
TRAVIS: He seems to be pretty smart, right?

02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:28.910
SAM: I mean, we could make a present.

02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:31.960
I could put fluffernutter in some sort of a bowl

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:33.580
or something, and we can hand it to him,

02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:34.950
and then make it blow up.

02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:37.160
TALIESIN: While we're in a small confined room with him.

02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:40.130
TRAVIS: Even if his guard is
slightly down, it's still a fight.

02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:41.400
We're not going to sneak up on him

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:43.515
or surprise him or ambush him.

02:01:43.515 --> 02:01:45.210
We're still going to him.
LAURA: Right.

02:01:45.210 --> 02:01:47.000
TRAVIS: We're trying to see
if we get him to come out, right?

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.314
So it's worth the shot.

02:01:49.314 --> 02:01:51.210
LAURA: Let's try to blow some things up.
MARISHA: Try to fight him on his home turf.

02:01:51.210 --> 02:01:53.690
Underwater, by the way.

02:01:53.690 --> 02:01:56.190
TRAVIS: Which we can breathe, but we're slow.
MARISHA: That's not cool.

02:01:56.190 --> 02:01:59.450
LAURA: And also, we can cast--

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:04.130
Before we do it, I should cast Freedom of Movement,

02:02:04.130 --> 02:02:07.221
because it lasts for an hour.

02:02:07.221 --> 02:02:08.827
MARISHA: One hour.

02:02:08.827 --> 02:02:13.657
TALIESIN: That eats into our Banish.

02:02:13.657 --> 02:02:15.510
TRAVIS: DM, do we remember how long it took us

02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:18.333
to traverse from the first entrance to where he was?

02:02:18.333 --> 02:02:20.640
LAURA: But it's important.

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:23.040
MATT: From the first entrance, it was about maybe--

02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.980
LIAM: Caleb would remember.

02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:28.500
MATT: Probably about an hour or so of travel,

02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:30.345
but that's also because you guys were being careful

02:02:30.345 --> 02:02:32.920
and finding your way

02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:35.560
as Vilya was leading you at a casual pace.

02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:38.530
TRAVIS: So Freedom of Movement at the last minute, right?

02:02:38.530 --> 02:02:41.150
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Right before we go in, yeah..

02:02:41.150 --> 02:02:44.650
MATT: Also, you do have

02:02:44.650 --> 02:02:47.690
the residuum for the Glyph of Warding thing

02:02:47.690 --> 02:02:49.940
you were also talking about last time.

02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:51.190
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that's right.

02:02:51.190 --> 02:02:52.900
We could use the residuum for that.

02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:57.290
SAM: To put a bomb on something, right?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:02:58.410 --> 02:02:59.243
TALIESIN: I mean, if we really want,

02:02:59.243 --> 02:03:02.190
we can also do a group Water Walk, if anyone's got that.

02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:05.060
LAURA: Yeah, but that's for surface.

02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:07.050
TALIESIN: I mean, if we want to just

02:03:07.050 --> 02:03:09.400
not deal with underwater at all.

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.020
LAURA: But he's completely underwater.

02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:12.300
LIAM: He's submerged.
TALIESIN: Mm.

02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:15.792
LIAM: And we don't know where we're going to be facing him.

02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:18.187
MARISHA: Okay.

02:03:18.187 --> 02:03:20.460
TRAVIS: But good if he comes here.

02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:22.560
TALIESIN: We have a couple Freedom of Movements, but it does

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:24.559
cut into our Banishment.

02:03:24.559 --> 02:03:25.800
LAURA: Yeah.

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:27.010
MARISHA: Yeah, it's just a matter of--

02:03:27.010 --> 02:03:28.293
Okay, okay.

02:03:29.376 --> 02:03:31.900
SAM: So far, our resources were:

02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:35.430
the ghosts at the Ruins, (clicks tongue)

02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:37.840
the dragon turtle, (clicks tongue)

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:40.900
the element of surprise, (clicks tongue)

02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:43.760
any member of the village, (clicks tongue)

02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:47.300
our own ship, (clicks tongue).

02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:49.520
That's it. (laughs)
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:53.913
Somehow, we found ourselves back to... fluffernutter.

02:03:53.913 --> 02:03:55.400
LIAM: So we start with fluffernutter.

02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:57.490
We hope that we can lure him in here,

02:03:57.490 --> 02:03:58.470
and if it does not work,

02:03:58.470 --> 02:04:01.360
we have to be prepared to get a message out to Vo

02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:04.640
for them to evacuate, or be on alert,

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:08.420
in case he dumps from above, the volcano.

02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:10.830
They could build another village.

02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:11.663
TRAVIS: They could.

02:04:11.663 --> 02:04:15.553
I also feel like they might just see it, right?

02:04:15.553 --> 02:04:17.100
If it starts to make a sound, a rumble,

02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:18.220
or earthquakes.

02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:19.970
I mean, unless they're just stupid.

02:04:20.890 --> 02:04:23.740
MARISHA: I mean, Vilya, we're hoping you all didn't build Vo

02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:26.540
in a direct lava flow path, did you?

02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:27.840
I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter

02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:29.497
if the whole thing blows, but--

02:04:29.497 --> 02:04:31.653
TRAVIS: You didn't build a channel down from the top.

02:04:31.653 --> 02:04:33.535
MATT: "No. No, we did not.

02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:36.630
"But I also haven't seen the volcano erupt

02:04:36.630 --> 02:04:39.830
"to its full capabilities."

02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:40.663
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:04:40.663 --> 02:04:43.333
This is some shit the DM would do.

02:04:43.333 --> 02:04:46.070
Like, you piss off a god and we kill a whole village.

02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:48.245
MARISHA: We kill the village.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:04:48.245 --> 02:04:49.913
We trigger Pompeii.

02:04:49.913 --> 02:04:52.060
SAM: We'll probably get a little bit of a warning.

02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:53.410
Like, if he sees a ship blow up,

02:04:53.410 --> 02:04:55.420
he's not going to just click the nuke.

02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:57.540
He's going to come see what it is first, right?

02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:00.370
TALIESIN: Figure out what's happening.
SAM: Yeah.

02:05:00.370 --> 02:05:04.210
LIAM: If he can't see the
specifics of what we're doing, he-- hmm.

02:05:04.210 --> 02:05:06.640
Such a tough call.
TALIESIN: It may be an accident.

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:08.510
He may ask us what's happening.

02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:10.510
TRAVIS: We don't know how to draw him out.

02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:12.800
We don't know how to warn them.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.300
Got to just commit, go in.

02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:17.358
SAM: To what, going in?

02:05:17.358 --> 02:05:18.720
TRAVIS: Well, I say we blow up the ships.

02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:19.960
If he doesn't come out, we go in.

02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:21.540
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.540
LIAM: Yeah, because if he comes, he's going to come.

02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:25.110
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Fairly quickly.

02:05:25.110 --> 02:05:28.120
TRAVIS: Hard and loud and yeah. I mean, you would think.

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:30.390
Unless he can do shit we don't anticipate,

02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:33.940
which is very likely.

02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:34.773
MARISHA: Shit.

02:05:35.770 --> 02:05:38.666
And yeah, by the way, the fluffernutter thing.

02:05:38.666 --> 02:05:40.950
I don't know fire damage is the right way to go

02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:43.110
with a volcano god.

02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:44.830
SAM: I'm not going to blow him up.
LIAM: Yeah, just his property.

02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:46.760
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:49.710
Just, there was a fluffernutter plan.

02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:51.310
SAM: Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, you're right.

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:52.980
You're totally right, yeah.

02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:55.005
TALIESIN: Avoid fire.

02:05:55.005 --> 02:05:55.838
TRAVIS: Woo!

02:05:55.838 --> 02:05:57.683
I'm excited.
ASHLEY: Me too.

02:05:57.683 --> 02:05:58.883
LAURA: (laughs)

02:05:58.883 --> 02:06:01.140
TRAVIS: I really feel like we've covered all the bases here,

02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:03.590
and in no way could analysis after the fact

02:06:03.590 --> 02:06:05.566
reveal anything we haven't thought of.

02:06:05.566 --> 02:06:07.050
(laughter)

02:06:07.050 --> 02:06:08.860
MARISHA: So true.
TRAVIS: Airtight!

02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:11.740
LIAM: Jester, do you have the
ability to send any more messages

02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:14.640
in case time passes and nothing?
SAM: Speaking of airtight--

02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:16.280
LAURA: Sure.
SAM: The entire chamber fills up with smoke.

02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:18.073
LIAM: I'm just saying in case.

02:06:19.010 --> 02:06:21.268
LAURA: I can send more messages, sure.

02:06:21.268 --> 02:06:23.230
I've got plenty more open slots right now.

02:06:23.230 --> 02:06:24.680
It's just-- (laughs)

02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:28.337
It's just--
LIAM: I understand the problem.

02:06:28.337 --> 02:06:29.803
TRAVIS: (laughing) I know.

02:06:29.803 --> 02:06:32.450
TALIESIN: It's nonstop.

02:06:32.450 --> 02:06:35.240
LIAM: I still want the ability to warn a lot of people

02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:39.040
that we've drawn the wrath of a god upon their heads.

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:40.240
LAURA: Yeah.

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:45.030
MARISHA: Vilya, is there any type of
alert system in the village?

02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:47.550
Do you have anything, anyone,

02:06:47.550 --> 02:06:49.160
that you can send a message to?

02:06:50.770 --> 02:06:53.540
MATT: "I don't have the capabilities

02:06:53.540 --> 02:06:56.440
"that your friend here does, unfortunately.

02:06:57.870 --> 02:06:59.230
"I'm usually one of the few

02:06:59.230 --> 02:07:02.200
"that sets up a flare of some kind.

02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:03.945
"I can alter the sky.

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:08.300
"We do have bells arranged throughout the village

02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:10.510
"that in case something is coming to attack--"

02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:13.600
MARISHA: Okay. You know, they've got bells.

02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:15.770
TALIESIN: If the volcano were to start making noise,

02:07:15.770 --> 02:07:17.540
would people know to--?

02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:18.780
MATT: "They would know Vokodo was angry

02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.560
"if it began to erupt.

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.710
"They wouldn't stand in the way of the flow.

02:07:25.768 --> 02:07:27.418
"They rely on me to keep him calm."

02:07:30.570 --> 02:07:31.640
TALIESIN: We may just have to trust

02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:34.480
that people are going to act in their own interest.

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.080
LIAM: Yeah, which, the problem is

02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:37.420
we don't know what he's going to do.

02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:38.253
TALIESIN: No.

02:07:41.170 --> 02:07:43.650
MATT: "So what's the plan?"

02:07:43.650 --> 02:07:46.710
SAM: We just have to trust that the V.O. community

02:07:46.710 --> 02:07:49.653
is filled with smart, smart people--

02:07:49.653 --> 02:07:52.403
(laughter)
who are not--

02:07:55.119 --> 02:07:58.130
who have no egos.
(laughter)

02:07:58.130 --> 02:07:59.830
Just think about the greater good.

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:03.310
LIAM: Hopefully they're all good at messaging.

02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:05.470
TRAVIS: What level is Messaging?
(laughter)

02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:07.280
LAURA: Third.
TRAVIS: Oof.

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:08.150
MARISHA: They're all definitely people

02:08:08.150 --> 02:08:09.410
I'd love to have a beer with.

02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:10.468
That's for sure.

02:08:10.468 --> 02:08:11.640
LAURA: So I could do--

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:15.657
the Glyph of Warding would use

02:08:15.657 --> 02:08:18.890
200 more residuum powder.

02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:22.560
MARISHA: I know, we're starting
to run out of resources, too.

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:23.800
That's the other thing.

02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:25.280
We've been here so long,

02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:26.940
we're going to deplete our resources.

02:08:28.179 --> 02:08:31.050
SAM: The Glyph would only do one attack, right?

02:08:31.050 --> 02:08:33.070
It's just a few.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:36.130
It's 5d8, if he doesn't make the save.

02:08:36.130 --> 02:08:40.990
It's a 5d8 whatever kind of damage we want it to be.

02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:42.760
TALIESIN: And it can't move, right?

02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:45.230
SAM: It's not terribly much.

02:08:45.230 --> 02:08:46.290
LIAM: The original idea was

02:08:46.290 --> 02:08:47.740
to have that be that kind of gift thing,

02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:49.630
but if he's coming, busting out

02:08:49.630 --> 02:08:53.280
into this boat lot--
MARISHA: It doesn't matter, yeah.

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:54.150
LAURA: Nah.

02:08:54.150 --> 02:08:56.178
MARISHA: Whatever. Should we start blowing up some boats?

02:08:56.178 --> 02:08:58.636
SAM: (laughs)

02:08:58.636 --> 02:08:59.711
Yep, that's our planning.
TALIESIN: I cannot believe

02:08:59.711 --> 02:09:01.630
that I'm in complete agreement over this.

02:09:01.630 --> 02:09:03.550
SAM: When it doubt, blow up a boat.

02:09:03.550 --> 02:09:05.220
MARISHA: Let's do it.
SAM: Yeah.

02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:07.890
I will not use fluffernutter.

02:09:07.890 --> 02:09:11.215
I will use my other bomb,

02:09:12.448 --> 02:09:13.673
my depth charge.

02:09:13.673 --> 02:09:15.620
TALIESIN: Are we going to be clever about this?

02:09:16.570 --> 02:09:18.170
LIAM: Doesn't seem like it.
ASHLEY: What does that mean?

02:09:18.170 --> 02:09:19.300
LAURA: Why start now?

02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.133
TALIESIN: Are we going to decide where to put them

02:09:20.133 --> 02:09:22.177
or just put them willy nilly?

02:09:22.177 --> 02:09:26.460
SAM: Well, there's a few boats that we can choose from.

02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:28.510
I don't want to do the fanciest one, right?

02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:30.260
That's Eden's Horizon.
MATT: Correct.

02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:33.230
SAM: There's also the Banshee, the Mistral, the Fiona.

02:09:33.230 --> 02:09:34.900
Any of these look like--?

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:36.989
TRAVIS: Good blowing up ship?
MARISHA: We should definitely blow up the Fiona.

02:09:36.989 --> 02:09:38.121
ASHLEY: I was going to say the Fiona too,

02:09:38.121 --> 02:09:39.300
because Fiona's just--
TALIESIN: Fiona's really got to go.

02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:40.370
MARISHA: Yeah, it's just a dumb name.

02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:42.595
ASHLEY: Lame.
(laughter)

02:09:42.595 --> 02:09:44.373
LAURA: It's not a terrible name, I like that name.

02:09:44.373 --> 02:09:46.410
TRAVIS: For a ship, right?
MARISHA: Oh, right.

02:09:46.410 --> 02:09:48.290
Not Fiona Fancypants.

02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:53.290
That's not at all indicative of where I'm talking about.

02:09:53.330 --> 02:09:54.680
Let's just start blowing up boats.

02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:56.090
Why are we still talking?

02:09:56.090 --> 02:10:00.110
SAM: Any of these good-looking vessels?

02:10:00.110 --> 02:10:02.310
MATT: I mean, the Sea Banshee is fairly nice,

02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:04.870
and has been taken care well.
MARISHA: Why are we still talking?

02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:09.580
MATT: The Mistral also is a nice medium-sized,

02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:12.670
looks like a naval vessel.

02:10:12.670 --> 02:10:16.260
SAM: And which is the furthest from the Vokodo door?

02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:20.000
MATT: The furthest from it would be the Fiona.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.010
LAURA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Perfect.

02:10:21.010 --> 02:10:23.340
SAM: Fiona's got to go.
TALIESIN: Have some Guidance.

02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:25.340
SAM: Oh, thank you.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:26.173
SAM: All right.

02:10:26.173 --> 02:10:29.200
I'd like to walk on water over to the Fiona

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:32.550
and attach my depth charge to it,

02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:34.250
or just put it on the--

02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:36.410
I don't know. Where should I put it, Fjord?

02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:38.820
Where is going to make the thing burn and sink?

02:10:40.090 --> 02:10:42.320
TRAVIS: Burn and sink? I don't know.

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:44.470
I haven't burned a lot of boats.

02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:46.150
SAM: What do we want, fire or sink?

02:10:47.190 --> 02:10:48.607
MARISHA: Fire.
TRAVIS: Fire, right?

02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:50.960
MARISHA: Fire!
TRAVIS: If you went above decks

02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:52.090
and went down into the hull

02:10:52.090 --> 02:10:53.450
and attached it right under the deck.

02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:55.220
SAM: Great.
TRAVIS: That'll be a show.

02:10:55.220 --> 02:10:56.053
SAM: I'll do that.

02:10:56.053 --> 02:10:57.250
MATT: You go and attach it there below the deck.

02:10:57.250 --> 02:10:59.390
SAM: And then, I mean,

02:10:59.390 --> 02:11:01.100
I've got to light it on fire or something

02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:02.740
so it'll explode.

02:11:02.740 --> 02:11:04.120
MARISHA: How far back should we all be?

02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:06.535
SAM: I don't know.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:11:06.535 --> 02:11:08.200
SAM: Come with me, will you?

02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:11.520
MARISHA: Gotta be close, make sure it works, yeah. (laughs)

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:12.600
SAM: All right.

02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:15.560
I guess, shall we make some sort of fuse,

02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:18.220
or just going to throw a Fireball at it?

02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:20.090
LIAM: I could just lob this over here.

02:11:20.090 --> 02:11:21.080
SAM: All right.
LIAM: Just a little bit.

02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:22.390
SAM: Somewhere where we can run away.

02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:23.530
SAM: This is not a Fireball.

02:11:23.530 --> 02:11:27.580
This is just a globule of fire.

02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:29.410
SAM: Sure, but it will explode,

02:11:29.410 --> 02:11:31.150
so we just need to be far enough back.

02:11:31.150 --> 02:11:34.970
LIAM: How far back?
SAM: Well, we're below decks?

02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:38.010
TRAVIS: Are you going to set
it off while you're in the ship?

02:11:38.010 --> 02:11:40.076
LIAM: No.
SAM: I mean, yes, I have no fuse.

02:11:40.076 --> 02:11:42.050
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yes, no!
(laughter)

02:11:42.050 --> 02:11:43.850
SAM: I have no fuse, so.

02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:46.905
TRAVIS: You definitely don't want to be on or near the ship.

02:11:49.204 --> 02:11:51.290
LIAM: I mean, the entire ship is made of wood.

02:11:51.290 --> 02:11:53.340
We could just set the boat on fire.

02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:54.755
SAM: Let's do that.

02:11:54.755 --> 02:11:56.020
(laughter)

02:11:56.020 --> 02:11:58.300
TRAVIS: Is it as loud as a depth charge?

02:11:58.300 --> 02:11:59.200
SAM: We'll set the boat on fire,

02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:00.530
but we'll leave the depth charge in,

02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:02.990
and when the fire reaches it, kaboom!

02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.970
LIAM: There you go.

02:12:03.970 --> 02:12:05.511
TALIESIN: Working together!

02:12:05.511 --> 02:12:07.550
TRAVIS: Starting to gel!

02:12:07.550 --> 02:12:08.960
MARISHA: We have a great knowledge of demolition.

02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:09.950
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:13.510
How do we run anything?
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:12:14.616 --> 02:12:17.709
LIAM: That was like a 19-point three-point turn.

02:12:17.709 --> 02:12:21.214
(car revving)
(laughter)

02:12:21.214 --> 02:12:24.713
MATT: All right, so placing the charge onto the upper deck

02:12:26.413 --> 02:12:28.860
of the deck, you all take a safe distance,

02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:29.960
and then what do you do?

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:33.758
LIAM: I just start using Fire Bolt

02:12:34.830 --> 02:12:37.810
to light this boat and maybe the one next to it on fire.

02:12:37.810 --> 02:12:39.760
MATT: It is a cantrip, so you can do it indefinitely.

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:40.870
It does take you a while,

02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:42.520
because, one, it's a moist interior,

02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:46.908
and looks like a lot of the wood here is somewhat--
LAURA: (giggles)

02:12:46.908 --> 02:12:48.940
MATT: Goddamn it.

02:12:48.940 --> 02:12:50.240
TALIESIN: Been all night. It's been all night.

02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:52.800
There's no one else. Okay.

02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:55.940
MATT: Missed you too, Laura.
(laughter)

02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:58.345
So it takes you a while to get the wood--

02:12:58.345 --> 02:13:00.231
(laughter)

02:13:00.231 --> 02:13:02.193
LIAM: Tell me more about the wood.
MATT: You get the wood dry enough.

02:13:02.193 --> 02:13:03.799
(laughter)

02:13:03.799 --> 02:13:05.149
TRAVIS: Dry that wood.

02:13:05.149 --> 02:13:06.965
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Make it so dry for you.

02:13:06.965 --> 02:13:11.730
(laughter, sounds of disgust)

02:13:11.730 --> 02:13:15.280
LIAM: Actually, with Control Flames,
which is a cantrip I have,

02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:19.140
I can, with one action, make five feet,

02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:21.250
turn into another five feet, into another five feet.

02:13:21.250 --> 02:13:22.083
So with that--
MATT: Yeah.

02:13:22.083 --> 02:13:23.710
Once it catches, you can switch to that,

02:13:23.710 --> 02:13:25.940
and as you do, the flames begin to spread

02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:29.300
and engulf the exterior and upper deck area

02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:31.670
of the Fiona.
LIAM: That's my cantrip.

02:13:31.670 --> 02:13:32.930
MATT: As it begins to burn bright,

02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:36.850
the interior of the cavern is now being warmly lit

02:13:36.850 --> 02:13:39.380
in the immediate vicinity of the ship,

02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:43.357
and you watch as the flames spread and spread and--

02:13:45.184 --> 02:13:46.630
(explosion)
ALL: (gasping)

02:13:46.630 --> 02:13:48.530
MATT: The detonation rocks the interior

02:13:48.530 --> 02:13:52.720
and you watch as the deck sprays a splintering cloud

02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:55.350
of shards of burning wood.

02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:57.810
The mast--
(crumbling)

02:13:57.810 --> 02:13:59.070
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MATT: Falls at the side,

02:13:59.070 --> 02:14:03.600
now itself engulfed in flames, and the ship is...

02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:06.590
It's a goner, and it's just now on fire,

02:14:06.590 --> 02:14:07.423
and you can see, slowly,

02:14:07.423 --> 02:14:10.580
it's beginning to capsize a bit to one side.

02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:12.320
LIAM: I look over to Yasha and say:

02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:16.610
Once you burn one ship, it's kind of hard to stop.

02:14:16.610 --> 02:14:19.302
SAM: No, no!
(laughter)

02:14:19.302 --> 02:14:23.582
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Yeah. (laughs)

02:14:23.582 --> 02:14:26.419
LIAM: (flame whooshing)
SAM: No, no!

02:14:26.419 --> 02:14:27.686
TRAVIS: Tackle him!

02:14:27.686 --> 02:14:28.910
(laughter)

02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:30.140
SAM: We can all hide or something.

02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:32.690
MATT: After a short time, you hear

02:14:34.659 --> 02:14:36.210
(rock rumbling)

02:14:36.210 --> 02:14:39.160
You feel a universal rumble.

02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:43.740
You watch as certain small elements of rock and stone

02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:46.100
begin to (splashing)
LAURA: Uh-oh.

02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:48.590
MATT: -- from the inside.
MARISHA: Is this roof going to collapse?

02:14:48.590 --> 02:14:50.711
LAURA: You put the roof on us?

02:14:50.711 --> 02:14:51.730
Should we get in the bubble?

02:14:51.730 --> 02:14:53.490
SAM: It's okay, it's fine, take cover.

02:14:53.490 --> 02:14:54.470
LIAM: I've got a pearl on my head

02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:56.730
and I'm starting to cast Fortune's Favor.

02:14:56.730 --> 02:15:00.450
MATT: The rumbling begins to subside a bit

02:15:00.450 --> 02:15:02.900
to just a low, continuous rumble.

02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:06.208
(rumbling)

02:15:06.208 --> 02:15:08.946
MARISHA: Does that mean he's coming?
TRAVIS: We spread out.

02:15:08.946 --> 02:15:10.750
LAURA: I'm going to make sure I'm standing next to Beau,

02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:12.870
and you should make sure you're standing next to Yasha.

02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:14.250
TALIESIN: All right.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

02:15:14.250 --> 02:15:15.416
MATT: Okay.

02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:18.936
ASHLEY: Wait, is the--
MATT: A few more moments pass.

02:15:18.936 --> 02:15:21.308
What's up?
ASHLEY: No, no, it's okay.

02:15:21.308 --> 02:15:23.370
MATT: A few moments pass. The rumbling continues.

02:15:23.370 --> 02:15:26.112
The ship is now burning and slowly,

02:15:26.112 --> 02:15:29.380
(bubbling)
it is sort of sinking,

02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:30.980
and it's hitting the edge of the sand bank,

02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:32.870
so it's sinking and beginning to tumble to the side

02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:36.230
to find itself to a deeper portion of the cavern,

02:15:36.230 --> 02:15:39.800
which now puts flames partially obscuring the exit

02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:41.356
from where the--
SAM: Good.

02:15:41.356 --> 02:15:44.320
MATT: (laughs) The waterfall is, but not entirely.

02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:46.511
The rumbling continues.

02:15:48.278 --> 02:15:50.219
It continues, unchanging.

02:15:50.219 --> 02:15:51.820
LAURA: Uh.
MATT: It's a perpetual rumble.

02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:56.200
TRAVIS: How's the temperature?
MATT: Of the chamber?

02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:59.000
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: It's the same.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.910
MARISHA: Can I put my hand in the water?

02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:01.743
MATT: Sure.

02:16:01.743 --> 02:16:03.700
MARISHA: Does the water feel

02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:06.025
the same temperature as before, or warmer?

02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:08.980
MATT: Currently, the water feels same temperature.

02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:11.758
LAURA: Can I try using...

02:16:12.616 --> 02:16:14.457
I'm going to get down

02:16:16.724 --> 02:16:19.057
and kneel down on the deck of

02:16:19.057 --> 02:16:20.499
whatever boat we're on right now.

02:16:20.499 --> 02:16:21.829
MATT: Okay.

02:16:21.829 --> 02:16:23.980
LAURA: And I'm going to try use Divine Intervention.

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:25.753
MATT: Okay.

02:16:25.753 --> 02:16:27.470
LAURA: To get the Traveler's attention here.

02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:28.570
MATT: What are you trying to do?

02:16:28.570 --> 02:16:30.420
What are you asking for with the Divine Intervention?

02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:32.713
LAURA: I'm going to ask the Traveler

02:16:37.623 --> 02:16:39.710
to help us get Vokodo out of his--

02:16:39.710 --> 02:16:43.000
TRAVIS: To fuck him.
(laughter)

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.740
LAURA: Get him here.
MATT: All right.

02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:47.873
Go ahead and make a roll.

02:16:47.873 --> 02:16:49.400
LAURA: Aw, I really shouldn't have said fuck him

02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:50.770
when I was talking to the dragon turtle.

02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:52.808
I really feel like I messed everything up with--

02:16:52.808 --> 02:16:54.850
TRAVIS: You said fuck him!
(laughter)

02:16:54.850 --> 02:16:57.308
LIAM: (as Jester) We are going to peg Vokodo.

02:16:57.308 --> 02:17:01.898
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:17:01.898 --> 02:17:04.100
LAURA: (bitter laugh)
TRAVIS: Oh, what? Say yes.

02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:06.890
LAURA: Oh, no, no. It's too high, it's too high.

02:17:06.890 --> 02:17:09.300
It's close, but it's too high.
MATT: Curses.

02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:12.180
As you reach out, the Traveler through your head,

02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:15.290
you hear the voice go, "Really'd love to help.

02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:16.123
"Currently dealing with

02:17:16.123 --> 02:17:19.200
"some really shitty travel buddies at the moment.

02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:21.650
"So sorry, but soon! (growls)"

02:17:21.650 --> 02:17:23.320
You can hear the frustration in his voice,

02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:25.995
not with you, but he seems to be preoccupied.

02:17:27.090 --> 02:17:29.260
The rumbling continues.

02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:34.260
Occasionally, it spikes.
(rumbling)

02:17:35.005 --> 02:17:37.583
TRAVIS: Hmm.
MATT: (loud rumbling)

02:17:37.583 --> 02:17:40.620
MARISHA: One of you guys that can do illusions and stuff.

02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:43.310
Should you be like, "Oh, shit!

02:17:43.310 --> 02:17:47.150
"They're destroying all the boats in Heaven's Falls, oh no!"

02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:48.970
MATT: Vilya closes her eyes for a second,

02:17:48.970 --> 02:17:51.570
and as she does, you see her face like...

02:17:52.730 --> 02:17:55.440
very faint flames licking up the sides of her forearms.

02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:57.860
SAM: Oh.
MATT: (rumbling)

02:17:57.860 --> 02:18:00.760
She thinks. "I have a bad feeling, hold on."

02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:05.150
And she transforms into a regular owl.

02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:06.900
Not a large one, a regular one.

02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:10.980
Coasts past the flames of the sinking ship, the Fiona,

02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:15.480
and heads through the illusion to the side,

02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:17.670
best she can, of the waterfall,

02:18:17.670 --> 02:18:19.500
and vanishes out of sight.

02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:20.813
MARISHA: Great. We're never going to see her again.

02:18:20.813 --> 02:18:22.657
LIAM: She's gone to--
LAURA: Check it out.

02:18:22.657 --> 02:18:25.095
LIAM: -- get an aerial.
TRAVIS: (imitating smoke)

02:18:25.095 --> 02:18:26.890
LAURA: She just said it was a really bad idea

02:18:26.890 --> 02:18:28.540
to go through that thing as a bird,

02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:29.940
and then she did it.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:31.777
LAURA: So it must be pretty serious.

02:18:31.777 --> 02:18:33.110
(laughter)

02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:35.303
MATT: Yeah. As a large bird, yes.

02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:38.860
She comes back through from the other side a moment later

02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:43.448
and lands, retransforms.

02:18:43.448 --> 02:18:44.931
"Well, it's erupting."

02:18:44.931 --> 02:18:46.690
(laughter)
MARISHA: Hmm, hmm.

02:18:46.690 --> 02:18:48.980
MATT: And you feel another
(rumbling)

02:18:48.980 --> 02:18:51.820
Rumble.
(laughter)

02:18:53.078 --> 02:18:54.981
SAM: We suck at this game!
MATT: More stones are...

02:18:54.981 --> 02:18:56.000
(splashes)

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.760
LIAM: I'm hoping that Caleb has had enough time,

02:18:57.760 --> 02:18:59.600
a minute, to cast Fortune's Favor.

02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:02.030
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: I think it's time to go--

02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:03.360
TRAVIS: In.
LIAM: Into the butthole.

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:05.290
TRAVIS: I agree.
LIAM: Immediately.

02:19:05.290 --> 02:19:07.010
LAURA: We're not going to get him out of here?

02:19:07.010 --> 02:19:08.420
TRAVIS: One thing.

02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:09.253
If he's pissed

02:19:09.253 --> 02:19:10.980
and that's what's causing the volcano to erupt,

02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:13.120
the water will be boiling.

02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:15.010
It's going to be very hot.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:19:15.010 --> 02:19:16.950
SAM: (high-pitched) So why are we going to go in, then?

02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:19.833
TRAVIS: I think we forgot to talk about that part.

02:19:19.833 --> 02:19:22.166
Remember he got mad and it started to get a little warm?

02:19:22.166 --> 02:19:23.830
LAURA: Yeah, you remember?
MARISHA: Saving throws.

02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:24.780
SAM: Are we going to lie?

02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:27.052
Are we going to say, like, "Oh, it was crazy!

02:19:27.052 --> 02:19:29.350
"It was crazy! Someone's destroying your ships!

02:19:29.350 --> 02:19:30.183
"We tried to stop them!"

02:19:30.183 --> 02:19:31.455
Or...
TRAVIS: We're going in,

02:19:31.455 --> 02:19:33.250
and we've got five minutes--
LAURA: Or do we say fuck it,

02:19:33.250 --> 02:19:36.100
and we try to keep destroying the ships,

02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:37.470
and hope he'll come out?

02:19:37.470 --> 02:19:39.310
TRAVIS: Blow another one up.
LAURA: Do one more.

02:19:39.310 --> 02:19:41.790
MARISHA: How many boats are burning?
ASHLEY: Oh, man.

02:19:41.790 --> 02:19:45.270
MARISHA: How many boats are on fire?
SAM: Just two. One?

02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:46.670
MATT: Just the Fiona, that's it.

02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:50.607
MARISHA: Maybe we should blow up more boats?

02:19:50.607 --> 02:19:51.710
ASHLEY: I feel like he'd let them all burn.

02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:54.490
SAM: This is a terrible idea!
LAURA: You think?

02:19:54.490 --> 02:19:56.156
TRAVIS: I don't know. If people start smashing your shit,

02:19:56.156 --> 02:19:58.430
and you've got 20 of something and they only break one,

02:19:58.430 --> 02:20:00.426
you're like, "Eh, not so bad."
LAURA: "I'm pissed."

02:20:00.426 --> 02:20:02.370
TRAVIS: Halfway through there, you're like, "Fuck it!"

02:20:02.370 --> 02:20:04.890
Unlocking the door and coming out, right?

02:20:04.890 --> 02:20:06.430
SAM: That's what I would do.
ASHLEY: Try it.

02:20:06.430 --> 02:20:08.270
MATT: It's up to you guys. What are you going to do?

02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:11.250
MARISHA: What if he's trapped in the volcano

02:20:11.250 --> 02:20:14.280
and he can't come out no matter how hard he wants to?

02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:17.000
TRAVIS: Wants to come out.
MARISHA: Hmm hmm.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:17.916
SAM: You could be right. It could be

02:20:17.916 --> 02:20:19.450
safe for him in there or something.

02:20:19.450 --> 02:20:20.283
I don't know.

02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:22.690
TALIESIN: I think he's stuck in there.
MATT: What are you doing?

02:20:22.690 --> 02:20:24.420
TRAVIS: You want to smoke another boat, or we going in?

02:20:24.420 --> 02:20:26.230
LIAM: Caleb's already burning the next ship.

02:20:26.230 --> 02:20:29.020
(laughter)

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:31.210
MATT: Which ship are you burning?
SAM: The Banshee.

02:20:31.210 --> 02:20:32.480
LAURA: Whatever's next to the Fiona.

02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:33.860
LIAM: Whatever's next to the Fiona.

02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:34.830
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Caleb's just like (groans).

02:20:34.830 --> 02:20:35.663
MATT: That's right. (laughs)

02:20:35.663 --> 02:20:38.570
You guys look over and just already just lobbing Fire Bolt.

02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:41.230
TRAVIS: With straight hair sticking out. (groans)

02:20:41.230 --> 02:20:42.270
TALIESIN: Okay, we're doing this.

02:20:42.270 --> 02:20:45.570
MATT: This ship continues to burn slowly.

02:20:45.570 --> 02:20:47.240
It takes about 10 minutes or so

02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:50.570
for it to become a fair inferno.

02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:51.660
The sails begin to catch,

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:52.760
and you watch as the Sea Banshee

02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:55.670
becomes another burning ship.

02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:58.380
It's going to take a little bit, but it is now on fire.

02:20:58.380 --> 02:21:00.250
Are you going to leave that and move to another one?

02:21:00.250 --> 02:21:01.842
What are you doing?

02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:04.880
LIAM: I will until someone tells me different.

02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:06.350
LAURA: No, no, no, no, no.

02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:08.880
TRAVIS: Burn it. Keep going.
TALIESIN: Keeping Resistance up.

02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:10.640
TRAVIS: We don't need these ships. He does.
MATT: Third ship or not?

02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:12.930
LIAM: Has anything changed at all in the 10 minutes

02:21:12.930 --> 02:21:15.850
that Caleb spent?
MATT: As it begins to burn,

02:21:15.850 --> 02:21:18.630
you hear and feel another
(rumbling)

02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:22.030
another heavy reverberance,

02:21:22.030 --> 02:21:24.310
almost like an explosion from the outside,

02:21:24.310 --> 02:21:25.900
and you all can feel and hear it

02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:28.010
from the inside of this chamber.

02:21:28.010 --> 02:21:30.530
TRAVIS: He's just like a uranium rod that's overreacting.

02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:33.625
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: (roaring fire)

02:21:33.625 --> 02:21:34.860
LAURA: Oh, god.
TRAVIS: We got to go.

02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:36.668
We got to go in.
LAURA: We got to go in.

02:21:36.668 --> 02:21:38.720
We're going to kill everybody.
TRAVIS: We're going to kill ourselves.

02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:39.840
LAURA: If they're not already dead.
TRAVIS: But we got to go in.

02:21:39.840 --> 02:21:41.350
MARISHA: Yeah, we're sitting--

02:21:41.350 --> 02:21:42.620
LAURA: We're going to die, you guys.

02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:45.260
This could kill us all.
MATT: What are you doing?

02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:48.637
TRAVIS: You know, we don't have to go in. (laughs)

02:21:48.637 --> 02:21:50.670
We could just go outside and wait.

02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:52.560
SAM: We could just leave everyone here to die. (laughs)

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:54.670
TRAVIS: Yeah, Vilya can step through a tree,

02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:56.030
take us to another continent.

02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:57.900
MATT: The second ship is now beginning to sink

02:21:57.900 --> 02:21:59.220
as you guys are waiting.

02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:01.270
Rumbling continuing. What are you doing?

02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:02.263
TRAVIS: We're going in, right?

02:22:02.263 --> 02:22:03.605
MARISHA: Vilya.

02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:07.422
Have you ever wanted to go to Wildemount?

02:22:09.010 --> 02:22:10.691
LAURA: We should go in.
MATT: "Not particularly."

02:22:10.691 --> 02:22:13.240
MARISHA: (sighs) Okay, we should go in.
LAURA: We have to save everyone.

02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:14.183
MARISHA: Okay.

02:22:14.183 --> 02:22:17.083
TRAVIS: Everybody on a rope?
SAM: We go in?

02:22:17.083 --> 02:22:18.220
TRAVIS: Let's jump into the water.

02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:20.320
MATT: You guys are going in?
TRAVIS: Yes, yes?

02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:21.610
ASHLEY: Yes.
TRAVIS: Yes?

02:22:21.610 --> 02:22:23.010
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Thumbs up?

02:22:23.010 --> 02:22:25.790
MARISHA: Yes!
TRAVIS: Form Voltron.

02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:27.050
Get your thumb up!
MARISHA: No, come on, Veth!

02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:29.150
TRAVIS: Get your thumb up, Veth!
LAURA: How long did we say

02:22:29.150 --> 02:22:30.670
it took to get through the tunnels?

02:22:30.670 --> 02:22:32.722
MARISHA: An hour.
MATT: From the other side,

02:22:32.722 --> 02:22:34.090
it was about an hour, yeah.
LAURA: Jesus, okay.

02:22:34.090 --> 02:22:35.340
SAM: From the other side.

02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:36.380
This side, we don't know how long it takes.

02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:37.490
MATT: You don't know long it will take from this side.

02:22:37.490 --> 02:22:38.550
SAM: It could be less.

02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:39.570
TRAVIS: We don't even know where this goes.

02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:41.620
LAURA: I'm going to be behind Beau

02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:44.270
and I'm just going to be ready to,

02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:47.628
as soon as I see the opening into the cavern,

02:22:47.628 --> 02:22:50.500
hit her and cast Freedom of Movement.

02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:52.166
MATT: You've got it.
TRAVIS: I'm a super-fast swimmer too, like him.

02:22:52.166 --> 02:22:54.293
SAM: Are we all tied together still?

02:22:54.293 --> 02:22:55.360
LAURA: We're all holding onto the rope,

02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:56.640
but it didn't matter the last time.

02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:59.380
TALIESIN: Actually, if you get there, you undo it, yeah.

02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:01.540
MATT: All right. So you guys all dive into the water.

02:23:01.540 --> 02:23:02.637
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

02:23:02.637 --> 02:23:03.890
SAM: Fuck!
LIAM: Terrible.

02:23:03.890 --> 02:23:05.810
TRAVIS: Feels great.
MATT: (splashes)

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:06.950
You all dive in.

02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:09.220
Vilya uncomfortably dives in with you.

02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:11.617
The water is warmer.
SAM: Sure.

02:23:11.617 --> 02:23:13.060
MARISHA: Oh, so it's gotten warmer.
MATT: It's gotten warmer.

02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:14.868
MARISHA: -- since I checked.
MATT: And as opposed to

02:23:14.868 --> 02:23:15.951
when you first touched it,

02:23:15.951 --> 02:23:19.800
the cold ocean temperature is now

02:23:21.576 --> 02:23:24.910
a lukewarm, a little above room temperature warmth.

02:23:24.910 --> 02:23:26.640
It's like a comfortable bath.

02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:28.580
LIAM: That's just because we nervously peed in it, though.

02:23:28.580 --> 02:23:30.480
MATT: Well, there's that too.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:33.830
MATT: So what is the marching order for this entering?

02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:37.020
LAURA: We're going to burn alive the minute we get in there.

02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:38.717
MARISHA: Fjord is going to lead us.

02:23:38.717 --> 02:23:40.330
MATT: Fjord is leading. Who's after Fjord?

02:23:40.330 --> 02:23:41.810
TRAVIS: Beau.
MARISHA: I'll be after, yeah.

02:23:41.810 --> 02:23:43.420
TRAVIS: It's Jester.
MATT: All right.

02:23:43.420 --> 02:23:47.250
LAURA: Can't we just, like...
MARISHA: And then Yasha and Caduceus.

02:23:47.250 --> 02:23:49.920
MATT: Wait, Yasha's after there?
MARISHA: After Beau.

02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:52.050
MATT: And then it's Yasha, and then Caduceus.

02:23:52.050 --> 02:23:54.638
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: All righty. And then?

02:23:56.520 --> 02:23:58.714
SAM: Me, I guess. Us.
LIAM: Sure, yeah, no.

02:23:58.714 --> 02:23:59.547
(laughter)
Don't put me last.

02:23:59.547 --> 02:24:01.810
Don't put me last. I'll go behind the firbolg.

02:24:01.810 --> 02:24:04.310
MATT: Vilya will go last.
SAM: I'll go last.

02:24:04.310 --> 02:24:05.150
MATT: All right.

02:24:05.150 --> 02:24:07.450
So you swim down and you can see

02:24:07.450 --> 02:24:11.030
the glowing orange entrance of the torchbloom plants

02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:14.060
that represent the beginning of this.

02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:14.910
Fjord, as you get there,

02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:15.743
I need you to go ahead

02:24:15.743 --> 02:24:17.582
and make a wisdom saving throw for me with advantage.

02:24:17.582 --> 02:24:22.210
TRAVIS: Yeah. With advantage.

02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:26.165
14.

02:24:28.490 --> 02:24:32.260
MATT: 14.
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:24:33.470 --> 02:24:36.470
MATT: As you approach, you see it,

02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:37.830
and you begin to get in front of the tunnel,

02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:40.820
and you get there and go, "Okay.

02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:42.150
"Okay, I know where it is. I know where it is.

02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:43.650
"I got to get there, I got to get there."

02:24:43.650 --> 02:24:44.910
And you take off.

02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:46.000
LAURA: So, he's holding the rope,

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.590
so all of us just start--
MATT: All of you guys...

02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:49.507
Well, no, you're already swimming fast,

02:24:49.507 --> 02:24:51.710
but you now swim with purpose,

02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:54.820
and something is guiding you the right path now.

02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:57.470
TRAVIS: I know where to go.
MATT: One after the next.

02:24:57.470 --> 02:24:58.380
MARISHA: He's got the bug.

02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:00.350
MATT: Could everybody roll a wisdom saving throw for me

02:25:00.350 --> 02:25:03.100
with advantage, please?

02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:08.960
MATT: Jester.

02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:10.100
LAURA: 24.
MATT: 24.

02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:12.015
LIAM: 22.
SAM: 19.

02:25:12.015 --> 02:25:13.780
ASHLEY: 18.
TALIESIN: 24.

02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:15.527
MARISHA: 16.
MATT: 16.

02:25:16.380 --> 02:25:18.850
Everyone but Beauregard

02:25:18.850 --> 02:25:22.770
is able to hold onto their mental state,

02:25:22.770 --> 02:25:26.040
but Beauregard, you also find yourself pushed forward.

02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:27.002
Now, you're all single file, so--

02:25:27.002 --> 02:25:30.280
MARISHA: Yeah, captain! Let's go!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:34.020
MATT: So, the two of you are just
rushing through the tunnels,

02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:35.480
so you can see where it branches off.

02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:38.810
Initially, one splinter and then three,

02:25:38.810 --> 02:25:41.280
and then it just becomes like numerous tunnels

02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:42.290
that splinter off,

02:25:42.290 --> 02:25:45.310
these lava tubes that are within the water.

02:25:45.310 --> 02:25:47.380
But the two people that are leading it

02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:48.860
seem to know where they're going.

02:25:48.860 --> 02:25:50.380
LAURA: Great.
MATT: And following their lead,

02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:55.213
you rush through for five,

02:25:55.213 --> 02:25:58.675
10, 15,

02:25:58.675 --> 02:25:59.800
20 minutes.

02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:03.360
The water getting slightly warmer as you progress.

02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:05.780
Not uncomfortable, but warmer.

02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:07.330
You're now getting to that, like...

02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:11.220
Almost to a hot shower-type temperature,

02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:14.800
where it's prickly, but it's tolerable.

02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:20.120
Roughly 35 minutes of rapid swimming,

02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:22.620
which the rest of you are starting feeling really nervous.

02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:24.420
The only light that's present here,

02:26:24.420 --> 02:26:25.950
because they have night vision,

02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:27.320
you can't see down here, Caleb,

02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:29.410
so you're going to have to keep some lights up with you

02:26:29.410 --> 02:26:30.660
if you want to be able to follow.

02:26:30.660 --> 02:26:32.690
LIAM: But at the moment I'm roped, right?

02:26:32.690 --> 02:26:35.560
MATT: Yeah. So are you just letting the rope take you?

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:38.440
LIAM: For now, yeah.
MATT: Okay.

02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:40.530
I need you, Caleb, to go ahead

02:26:40.530 --> 02:26:42.140
and make a dexterity saving throw for me.

02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:43.900
LIAM: Okay.

02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:46.290
LAURA: Would the fire flowers give off

02:26:46.290 --> 02:26:49.200
any kind of glow?
MATT: Actually, no.

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:51.280
The torchbloom does give off a little bit of light.

02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:52.520
LIAM: I thought.
MATT: So yes.

02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:54.440
You are totally right.

02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:55.780
So what'd you roll?
LIAM: I got a 20!

02:26:55.780 --> 02:26:56.850
MATT: A 20. All right.

02:26:56.850 --> 02:26:58.320
So, even letting the rope take you,

02:26:58.320 --> 02:26:59.950
you push away at times to keep yourself

02:26:59.950 --> 02:27:04.520
from colliding with the sides of the tunnel, the orange...

02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:09.504
It feels like an odd similarity to...

02:27:11.630 --> 02:27:15.700
My brain keeps going to the other side in Poltergeist,

02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:17.540
how you're just this continuous tunnels

02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:19.730
that just continue to shift and change,

02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:21.400
and they move with the water,

02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:24.230
as the torchbloom shifts with the swimming

02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:27.380
and the separation of the liquid

02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:30.340
you guys are swimming through.

02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:33.890
Eventually, you see it begins to widen,

02:27:33.890 --> 02:27:36.290
as both Fjord and Beauregard make your way

02:27:36.290 --> 02:27:38.597
towards what looks to be

02:27:38.597 --> 02:27:42.238
a familiar but different

02:27:42.238 --> 02:27:45.146
opening into a chamber.

02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:47.918
LAURA: Oh, as soon as I see the opening--

02:27:47.918 --> 02:27:50.190
(splutters) I cast Freedom of Movement on Beau.

02:27:50.190 --> 02:27:52.050
MATT: Okay, Beauregard, you have Freedom of Movement.

02:27:52.050 --> 02:27:53.250
MARISHA: Dope.

02:27:53.250 --> 02:27:54.570
MATT: Anybody else do anything before you get to him?

02:27:54.570 --> 02:27:56.144
LIAM: Mirror Image.
LAURA: Freedom of Movement on Yasha.

02:27:56.144 --> 02:27:57.720
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:27:57.720 --> 02:27:59.940
MATT: Okay.
SAM: I'll throw up Mage Hand.

02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:01.580
MATT: Sure.
LIAM: I'm casting Mirror Image.

02:28:01.580 --> 02:28:03.140
MATT: Mirror Image on yourself, all right.

02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:05.030
Anything else?

02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.863
Okay.

02:28:05.863 --> 02:28:08.130
LAURA: Can I do something else?

02:28:08.130 --> 02:28:09.498
Or since I cast Freedom of Movement,

02:28:09.498 --> 02:28:10.840
is that my only thing I can do?

02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:12.715
MATT: As you're approaching...

02:28:14.073 --> 02:28:15.100
They begin to slow down

02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:16.200
as they get to the edge point.

02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:19.103
You can do it if you want to keep it subtle.

02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:21.390
LAURA: Right before we go through,

02:28:21.390 --> 02:28:24.080
I wanted to Invoke Duplicity.

02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:26.060
MATT: Okay, yeah, that's easy enough.

02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:26.893
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: You can do it.

02:28:26.893 --> 02:28:30.855
Okay. So Duplicity has been Invoked.

02:28:32.210 --> 02:28:35.730
SAM: This plan cannot fail.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:28:35.730 --> 02:28:36.930
SAM: We have the element of surprise...

02:28:36.930 --> 02:28:39.020
LAURA: We got to go fast.
SAM: What are we doing?

02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:41.430
LAURA: Just go in and attack.
SAM: We're just (exclaiming)?

02:28:41.430 --> 02:28:44.522
MARISHA: This feels like the most we've planned

02:28:44.522 --> 02:28:46.390
and the least we've planned

02:28:46.390 --> 02:28:47.980
all at the same time.

02:28:47.980 --> 02:28:51.400
LAURA: Literally, I think we go in immediately and attack,

02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:53.090
the minute we go through the door.

02:28:53.090 --> 02:28:54.750
MATT: As you guys enter the chamber--

02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:55.830
SAM: What could go wrong?

02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:58.905
MATT: -- there are still those pockets of torchbloom

02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:01.500
that give off a little bit of light throughout the chamber,

02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:03.780
but it's still a heavily shaded space.

02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:06.380
You see the familiar stalactites

02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:07.650
that curl down from the ceiling.

02:29:07.650 --> 02:29:09.990
This, you're pretty sure, is the exact chamber

02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:12.140
where you first encountered Vokodo,

02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:14.100
just from a different perspective.

02:29:14.100 --> 02:29:16.675
You found an entrance from another side.

02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:20.340
The temperature in here is quite hot.

02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:21.530
The water itself,

02:29:21.530 --> 02:29:25.660
it's beginning to numb the skin a little bit in places

02:29:25.660 --> 02:29:28.093
with the volume of heat that's within.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.533
MARISHA: Any sign of Vokodo?

02:29:32.533 --> 02:29:34.616
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:29:34.616 --> 02:29:36.470
TALIESIN: I'll join in that.
MARISHA: Maybe he's busy,

02:29:36.470 --> 02:29:39.600
operating the volcano.
SAM: Yeah, the levers and stuff.

02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:41.130
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly.
TRAVIS: He's the wizard.

02:29:41.130 --> 02:29:43.130
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:46.273
Okay, 18?
TALIESIN: 17. Hmm.

02:29:46.273 --> 02:29:48.681
MATT: Okay. You glance up and catch the first sight

02:29:48.681 --> 02:29:51.100
as in the ceiling portion

02:29:51.100 --> 02:29:53.360
where he was first spotted when you came through,

02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:57.030
you see these burning red orbs,

02:29:57.030 --> 02:30:00.050
these angry eyes, four of them,

02:30:00.050 --> 02:30:02.639
looking back in your direction, as tendrils

02:30:02.639 --> 02:30:03.670
(whooshing, crunching)

02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:04.950
and it pulls its way down

02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:08.720
like some sort of massive coal-colored cephalopod.

02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:09.870
TRAVIS: Cool, cool.

02:30:11.596 --> 02:30:16.596
MATT: (as Vokodo) "What have you done?"

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:18.686
And as he yells, the whole chamber--

02:30:18.686 --> 02:30:21.210
(rumbling)
quakes angrily.

02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:25.920
LAURA: Guiding Bolt.
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:27.704
MATT: Well, we're going to go ahead and take a break.

02:30:27.704 --> 02:30:30.220
(laughter)

02:30:30.220 --> 02:30:33.560
And jump back into this beforehand,

02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:36.273
but as part of that, let me go ahead and set the battle map.

02:30:36.273 --> 02:30:37.470
(clamoring)
ASHLEY: Oh, boy.

02:30:37.470 --> 02:30:42.470
SAM: This impending TPK is brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

02:30:42.716 --> 02:30:44.690
The journey out into the Wildlands,

02:30:44.690 --> 02:30:46.970
Dwarven Forge's eighth terrain Kickstarter,

02:30:46.970 --> 02:30:48.370
launches this weekend.

02:30:48.370 --> 02:30:52.288
Check it out at DwarvenForge.com/Wildlands.

02:30:52.288 --> 02:30:57.288
(clamoring)

02:30:57.803 --> 02:31:00.240
MARISHA: Sometimes I see him buying pretty things,

02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:02.855
and then I learn later that they're to destroy us.

02:31:02.855 --> 02:31:04.040
MATT: (laughs)
ASHLEY: That is beautiful!

02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:05.990
TRAVIS: Oh, it's for all the fish you don't have.

02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:08.320
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah!

02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:10.500
SAM: Any time you see an aquarium receipt

02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:12.754
on your credit card bill, please text us.

02:31:12.754 --> 02:31:15.504
(laughter)

02:31:16.865 --> 02:31:18.360
TRAVIS: We've got a early warning system!

02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:20.540
MARISHA: I will!
LAURA: There we go.

02:31:20.540 --> 02:31:23.020
SAM: Pet store? No, no, something's wrong!

02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:24.960
ASHLEY: Look at this!
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:27.468
LAURA: Wow!
ASHLEY: That is so cool!

02:31:27.468 --> 02:31:28.520
SAM: Whoa.

02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:31.120
MATT: Have essentially entered from this side.

02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:33.950
SAM: The element of surprise.
MATT: Exactly.

02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:35.970
LIAM: I mean, we've been doing Guiding Bolt up the butt

02:31:35.970 --> 02:31:37.670
since campaign one, so--
MARISHA: It's appropriate.

02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:38.503
LAURA: Right?

02:31:39.524 --> 02:31:40.357
MATT: So you guys can tell me

02:31:40.357 --> 02:31:42.370
where you would like to be distributed at this point

02:31:42.370 --> 02:31:43.280
as you enter the chamber.

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:47.054
LIAM: Outside the volcano on Vo.

02:31:47.054 --> 02:31:48.100
TALIESIN: Rumblecusp.
MATT: Loosely in this space,

02:31:48.100 --> 02:31:51.120
because that's as far as you've gotten there.

02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:52.890
LAURA: Fjord and Beau are the first ones out,

02:31:52.890 --> 02:31:54.380
so you guys could get the farthest,

02:31:54.380 --> 02:31:55.320
or wherever you'd want to be,

02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:57.090
and he is, what, directly above us?

02:31:57.090 --> 02:32:00.540
MARISHA: Yeah, where is he?
MATT: He is up here.

02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:04.430
Like, just emerging from the upper portions of the chamber

02:32:04.430 --> 02:32:06.410
and swimming--
MARISHA: How far can we get?

02:32:07.290 --> 02:32:08.640
MATT: Right now, to where we start,

02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:10.690
is about this inch of space here.

02:32:10.690 --> 02:32:13.270
Just tell me where in that space you want to be.

02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:16.210
MARISHA: I'll try and, uh...

02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:21.130
Gosh. Can I even try and get up here, or?

02:32:21.130 --> 02:32:22.570
TALIESIN: You have Freedom of Movement from her.

02:32:22.570 --> 02:32:23.403
LAURA: Yeah.

02:32:23.403 --> 02:32:26.160
MATT: You do, but for the purposes of this,

02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:28.240
this is just arriving,

02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:29.570
and this is happening here, so...

02:32:29.570 --> 02:32:32.210
SAM: I'll hook right with Caleb, if you're up for it.

02:32:32.210 --> 02:32:34.790
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. To get behind that column, yeah.

02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:35.623
SAM: That thing.

02:32:35.623 --> 02:32:36.820
MATT: Okay, that's as far as you guys can get

02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:38.312
from stepping into the chamber.

02:32:38.312 --> 02:32:39.530
MARISHA: Oh, you guys are behind?

02:32:39.530 --> 02:32:41.410
Okay, then actually, put me opposite.

02:32:41.410 --> 02:32:44.210
Put me on this wall over here, Matt, yeah.

02:32:44.210 --> 02:32:45.490
MATT: That's about as far as you can get

02:32:45.490 --> 02:32:46.880
from the entrance there.
MARISHA: That's great.

02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:48.960
MATT: Best to scatter. Caduceus?

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:49.930
TALIESIN: I guess I'm just--

02:32:49.930 --> 02:32:51.320
Yeah, or right to the left

02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:53.740
so I have a partial cover from the column.

02:32:53.740 --> 02:32:55.340
MATT: Over here?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:32:55.340 --> 02:32:57.730
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I got a plan.

02:32:57.730 --> 02:32:59.680
MATT: Vilya's going to come right here. Yasha?

02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:04.520
TRAVIS: Where is Vokodo, ish?
LAURA: Above us.

02:33:04.520 --> 02:33:06.250
MATT: Up here.
TRAVIS: Oh, cool, yeah.

02:33:06.250 --> 02:33:11.020
ASHLEY: Yeah, let me go to the other side of Jester.

02:33:12.030 --> 02:33:14.281
SAM: How could we have fucked this up this badly?

02:33:14.281 --> 02:33:15.714
LIAM: So much planning--
MATT: Over here?

02:33:15.714 --> 02:33:17.227
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
LIAM: -- and debating and discussion.

02:33:17.227 --> 02:33:18.430
LAURA: And then we just ran in.

02:33:18.430 --> 02:33:20.940
LIAM: We just walked in and done the same thing.

02:33:20.940 --> 02:33:22.552
MARISHA: Well...
MATT: Now, remember.

02:33:22.552 --> 02:33:24.010
MARISHA: It was a good plan.
MATT: You are swimming,

02:33:24.010 --> 02:33:25.710
so you can go--
LAURA: Up and down.

02:33:25.710 --> 02:33:28.580
MATT: Up and down. There's upward, vertical travel in this.

02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:30.560
TRAVIS: How tall is the cavern?
MATT: The cavern

02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:33.040
up here is roughly 80 feet.
TRAVIS: 80 feet.

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:34.100
SAM: And is it all water

02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:35.330
to the top, no?

02:33:35.330 --> 02:33:36.750
MATT: You haven't swam all the way up there,

02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:38.400
but from what you can currently see

02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:40.770
it seems like it might be.
SAM: Oh shit.

02:33:40.770 --> 02:33:42.180
ASHLEY: My god.
TRAVIS: You just peek your head out

02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:43.615
and it's just magma.

02:33:43.615 --> 02:33:45.073
(burning and screaming)

02:33:45.073 --> 02:33:46.790
(laughter)

02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:48.780
LIAM: There's this much oxygen.

02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:50.180
TALIESIN: We can swim in here?
MATT: Yes, you can.

02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:51.620
TALIESIN: We can go up?
MATT: Yep.

02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:54.586
But those of you that do not have Freedom of Movement,

02:33:54.586 --> 02:33:57.870
or have a swim enchantment, like you do,

02:33:57.870 --> 02:33:59.440
it's half movement

02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:02.920
and all attack rolls made with weapons are at disadvantage.

02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:05.030
SAM: Oof.
MATT: So just be aware.

02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:07.640
LAURA: But Freedom of Movement, that is not the case?

02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:09.810
MATT: Correct. So you guys don't have to worry about that.

02:34:09.810 --> 02:34:11.770
Spells don't have to worry about it.

02:34:11.770 --> 02:34:15.100
Ranged weapons have their own unique little weird thing.

02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:16.062
SAM: Sure.

02:34:16.062 --> 02:34:18.320
Like, if I fire from cover,

02:34:19.220 --> 02:34:20.840
which would normally be advantage,

02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:22.040
this would be at disadvantage,

02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:24.930
so it would just be a straight roll?

02:34:24.930 --> 02:34:26.630
MATT: Specifically on this, let me get the rules,

02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:28.010
because this will definitely impact

02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:30.790
how you deal with this particular battle.

02:34:31.663 --> 02:34:34.530
(pages flipping)

02:34:34.530 --> 02:34:36.740
MARISHA: The D-Turt idea was very great.

02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:37.630
MATT: It was really great.

02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:39.195
I really wanted it to work out, I'm so sorry.

02:34:39.195 --> 02:34:41.030
TRAVIS: 20 DC, huh?
MATT: 20 DC, yeah.

02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:43.870
LIAM: Kaiju fight?
MARISHA: It would've been great.

02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:44.930
MATT: Here we go.

02:34:44.930 --> 02:34:46.420
"Ranged weapon automatically misses

02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:49.090
"if it's beyond the weapon's normal range."

02:34:49.090 --> 02:34:50.450
SAM: I have good range.

02:34:50.450 --> 02:34:52.710
MATT: So what's your first range increment?

02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:54.540
SAM: Uh...
MARISHA: Don't you have Sharpshooter?

02:34:54.540 --> 02:34:56.560
SAM: I just got a feat, or whatever, so...

02:34:58.590 --> 02:35:01.460
Well, it hasn't updated, but I think it's 120 feet.

02:35:04.117 --> 02:35:07.820
MATT: For your hand crossbow?
LIAM: Because of Sharpshooter.

02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:10.130
LAURA: Oh, yeah, Sharpshooter.
SAM: Sharpshooter.

02:35:10.130 --> 02:35:14.840
LAURA: Which gives you 120 feet.
MATT: Let me double-check.

02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:17.360
SAM: "Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage

02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:18.220
"on your ranged weapon attack."

02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:20.140
MATT: Right, it's still long range, though.

02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:21.400
It's still the standard range.
SAM: Got it.

02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:23.493
So 30 feet is my limit.

02:35:23.493 --> 02:35:24.450
MATT: Correct.

02:35:24.450 --> 02:35:26.230
If you fire further than 30 feet from it,

02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:28.180
it's going to automatically miss.
SAM: Got it.

02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:30.100
MATT: So keep that in mind, and...

02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:36.630
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, oh. That's significant.

02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:37.740
MATT: "Any attack has disadvantage

02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:38.850
"unless the weapon is a crossbow."

02:35:38.850 --> 02:35:40.210
So it does not have disadvantage,

02:35:40.210 --> 02:35:42.550
but the bolt only goes as far as 30 feet before it floats.

02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:43.430
SAM: Okay.

02:35:43.430 --> 02:35:44.740
LIAM: Let's go, brawlers.

02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:46.378
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Great.

02:35:46.378 --> 02:35:51.378
But bonus on Freedom of Movement is you can't be...

02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:53.220
Let me--
MARISHA: Can't be grappled.

02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:55.320
LAURA: You can't be grappled, yeah.
MATT: Correct.

02:35:56.614 --> 02:35:58.210
LAURA: And you can automatically escape

02:35:58.210 --> 02:36:00.450
from any non-magical restraints

02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:03.730
with just using five feet of movement.

02:36:03.730 --> 02:36:06.360
MATT: That's phenomenal. So keep that in mind.

02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:08.880
That might come in handy. All right.

02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:10.170
We're going to go ahead and take a break here,

02:36:10.170 --> 02:36:13.010
and return here for whatever
this battle's going to look like.

02:36:13.010 --> 02:36:13.843
SAM: Yeah.

02:36:13.843 --> 02:36:17.260
MATT: In the middle of an angry erupting volcano

02:36:17.260 --> 02:36:19.000
and whatever Vokodo is.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.140
So we'll see you guys back here after the break shortly.

02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:22.520
Be ready.

02:37:49.883 --> 02:37:51.900
Hey, Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:54.303
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:37:55.860 --> 02:37:58.210
You're only like clicks away from owning this,

02:37:58.210 --> 02:38:00.730
maybe more if you have a lot of windows open

02:38:00.730 --> 02:38:02.913
on your browser, I don't know your life.

02:38:03.970 --> 02:38:06.200
Darling, I recommend buying two,

02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:10.593
one for you and another for you, let's be honest.

02:38:12.131 --> 02:38:17.131
Oh, look at this, look at the details, oh.

02:38:17.180 --> 02:38:20.990
All these and more now available in the Critical Role Shop.

02:38:20.990 --> 02:38:23.657
(upbeat music)

02:38:26.460 --> 02:38:27.473
Subscribe,

02:38:29.260 --> 02:38:31.083
or don't subscribe,

02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:35.063
(man sighs) that's not a question.

02:38:37.370 --> 02:38:40.660
Well that is noble in the mind to ponder the pros

02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:43.933
and more pros of Twitch or Twitch prime.

02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:48.480
Or to take hands and gift new subs to Critters

02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:50.363
who find they can't afford them.

02:38:52.310 --> 02:38:53.273
To play,

02:38:56.170 --> 02:38:57.003
to sleep,

02:38:59.270 --> 02:39:00.103
no more.

02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:05.160
And by a sleep to say the cast and crew of Critical Role

02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:07.860
might find their naps around the hectic schedule

02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:10.630
of a live broadcast that we have brought

02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:14.663
for your consumption, both Critter and fan alike.

02:39:17.310 --> 02:39:18.393
To play,

02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:20.403
or sleep?

02:39:22.037 --> 02:39:23.760
(man scoffs)

02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:24.753
No sleep,

02:39:25.770 --> 02:39:27.623
but just to stream.

02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:30.983
All right there's the rub.

02:39:32.110 --> 02:39:37.103
For, with your subscription, what screens may come.

02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:43.350
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tagline.

02:39:43.350 --> 02:39:44.273
Did we got that?

02:39:45.212 --> 02:39:47.553
Oh, that is Twitch poetry.

02:39:48.951 --> 02:39:50.330
(man grunting)

02:39:50.330 --> 02:39:54.340
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

02:39:54.340 --> 02:39:56.410
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe,

02:39:56.410 --> 02:39:57.920
gift some subscriptions.

02:39:57.920 --> 02:39:59.613
You, you got it.

02:40:03.850 --> 02:40:08.652
Wrong slogan for the skull, but that's been good.

02:40:08.652 --> 02:40:11.319
(upbeat music)

02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:46.930
MATT: And welcome back.

02:52:46.930 --> 02:52:50.700
So picking right up where we left off,

02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:53.390
you all had entered--
LAURA: Oh, no!

02:52:53.390 --> 02:52:58.170
MATT: -- the interior home, central chamber,

02:52:58.170 --> 02:53:00.430
beneath the volcano of Rumblecusp

02:53:00.430 --> 02:53:02.385
where Vokodo resides.

02:53:04.608 --> 02:53:06.942
And let's go ahead and get that on the board.

02:53:06.942 --> 02:53:08.771
(groaning)

02:53:08.771 --> 02:53:12.040
LIAM: Oh, look at that, it's so small!
ASHLEY: Oh, my goodness gracious.

02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:13.360
LAURA: He's so sparkly!
MARISHA: He lights up.

02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:16.072
MATT: It's where the heat from the mouth comes from.

02:53:17.821 --> 02:53:18.654
TALIESIN: ♪ Motorin'. ♪

02:53:18.654 --> 02:53:20.511
LIAM: Holy shit.
ASHLEY: ♪ Motorin'. ♪

02:53:20.511 --> 02:53:22.670
LAURA: (yelling)
SAM: It's too big!

02:53:22.670 --> 02:53:26.298
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's pretty big.
ASHLEY: That's really big.

02:53:26.298 --> 02:53:27.720
LAURA: It's a pretty big...

02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:28.590
MATT: So--
LAURA: Oh, no.

02:53:28.590 --> 02:53:30.120
MARISHA: Look at the treasure chest on his back.

02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:32.170
That's so cute!

02:53:32.170 --> 02:53:33.831
MATT: I'd like you all to roll initiative.

02:53:33.831 --> 02:53:35.480
(groaning)
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

02:53:35.480 --> 02:53:36.650
LIAM: It's like a bunch of dog poops

02:53:36.650 --> 02:53:38.343
with treasure swirled into it.

02:53:38.343 --> 02:53:41.170
MARISHA: (sighing)

02:53:41.170 --> 02:53:43.330
TALIESIN: Gross.
LIAM: Aw, damn it!

02:53:43.330 --> 02:53:44.380
I don't want a high initiative.

02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:46.260
TRAVIS: Are you fucking kidding me?
LIAM: I'll watch.

02:53:46.260 --> 02:53:48.010
TALIESIN: It's okay, I should go last anyway.

02:53:48.010 --> 02:53:50.705
Healer should go last.

02:53:50.705 --> 02:53:52.510
LIAM: I hate going first with Caleb.

02:53:52.510 --> 02:53:54.820
TRAVIS: I'm definitely last.
SAM: I don't know.

02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:56.520
TALIESIN: I don't know.
TRAVIS: Can you roll...

02:53:57.560 --> 02:53:59.810
MATT: 20 or 25?
MARISHA: 21.

02:53:59.810 --> 02:54:00.660
SAM: Yeah!
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:54:00.660 --> 02:54:02.530
LIAM: 21.
SAM: Whoa!

02:54:02.530 --> 02:54:04.360
MARISHA: Ah, fuck, Caleb! What?

02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:06.333
TRAVIS: Caleb and Beau?
SAM: ♪ Empire. ♪

02:54:06.333 --> 02:54:08.020
LAURA: (laughs)
MATT: Caleb, what'd you get?

02:54:08.020 --> 02:54:09.590
LIAM: 21.
MARISHA: Also 21.

02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:12.050
LAURA: But Beau's dex is higher.
TRAVIS: So Beau first.

02:54:12.050 --> 02:54:13.970
SAM: I don't know about that.
LIAM: I mean...

02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:16.810
Let's have a push-up contest.
MARISHA: Okay. (laughs)

02:54:16.810 --> 02:54:21.250
MATT: 20 to 15?
ASHLEY: 15 for me.

02:54:21.250 --> 02:54:23.400
MATT: 15, all right.
MARISHA: Nice.

02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:24.966
LIAM: Oh, shit.

02:54:26.710 --> 02:54:28.051
MATT: 15 to 10?

02:54:29.352 --> 02:54:31.083
LAURA: 12.

02:54:31.083 --> 02:54:33.853
MATT: 12 for Jester.

02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:38.060
10 to 5?

02:54:38.060 --> 02:54:38.960
TALIESIN: Five.

02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:42.890
SAM: (bad American accent) I rolled an eight.
(laughter)

02:54:42.890 --> 02:54:47.305
MATT: Thank you, Sam Riegel.
SAM: I'm a American soldier.

02:54:47.305 --> 02:54:48.745
(laughter)

02:54:48.745 --> 02:54:50.720
ASHLEY: He looks so cool.

02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:53.040
LAURA: This is really beautiful.
ASHLEY: It's so cool.

02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:55.017
LAURA: What a good environment for us all to die.

02:54:55.017 --> 02:54:56.867
MATT: Yeah, if you're going to go.

02:54:56.867 --> 02:54:58.140
And then--
LIAM: Is there a light in Vokodo,

02:54:58.140 --> 02:54:59.170
or is it behind him?
MATT: Fjord?

02:54:59.170 --> 02:55:00.130
MARISHA: It's in his mouth.

02:55:00.130 --> 02:55:03.210
ASHLEY: Oh, no.
LAURA: Fjord!

02:55:03.210 --> 02:55:05.565
ASHLEY: Does he have a light on his back?

02:55:05.565 --> 02:55:06.618
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:55:06.618 --> 02:55:07.451
LAURA: There's a light in his mouth?

02:55:07.451 --> 02:55:09.402
MARISHA: Mouth.
ASHLEY: That's his mouth?

02:55:09.402 --> 02:55:12.260
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: You're a very handsome man, Travis.

02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:14.218
MATT: Right there.

02:55:15.134 --> 02:55:18.090
LAURA: (groaning)
ASHLEY: Oh, that is so cool.

02:55:18.090 --> 02:55:19.150
TALIESIN: None of this is happening.

02:55:19.150 --> 02:55:21.860
SAM: You could use that as a emergency flashlight

02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:23.053
to find your keys and stuff.

02:55:23.053 --> 02:55:25.810
MATT: Exactly. It's what it's there for.

02:55:25.810 --> 02:55:29.140
So, top of the round, as Vokodo pulls forward,

02:55:29.140 --> 02:55:30.660
shouting at you all,

02:55:30.660 --> 02:55:32.220
the water itself around you

02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:34.730
seems to almost bubble in places,

02:55:34.730 --> 02:55:38.730
and the heat is rising all around you.

02:55:38.730 --> 02:55:42.070
Beauregard, you're up first, with Caleb on deck.

02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:46.320
MARISHA: Does Jester get her Guiding Bolt as a surprise?

02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:48.850
MATT: Wasn't a surprise round.
MARISHA: Oh.

02:55:48.850 --> 02:55:51.610
MATT: He wasn't surprised. He knew you guys were coming.

02:55:51.610 --> 02:55:53.850
So you initiating the Guiding Bolt...

02:55:53.850 --> 02:55:55.500
So, you begin casting the Guiding Bolt,

02:55:55.500 --> 02:55:57.730
because it's like a incantation.

02:55:57.730 --> 02:55:59.510
Combat starts, initiative now,

02:55:59.510 --> 02:56:01.650
so as you're casting the spell,

02:56:01.650 --> 02:56:03.630
Beauregard rushes past you.
LAURA: Okay.

02:56:03.630 --> 02:56:05.050
I don't know if I'll still want to do Guiding Bolt

02:56:05.050 --> 02:56:06.420
by the time it's my turn, but...

02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:08.730
MATT: Up to you, then. You can change before you get there.

02:56:08.730 --> 02:56:10.510
LIAM: What's the lighting like in here?

02:56:10.510 --> 02:56:11.990
For the humans and all that.

02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:14.310
MATT: For the humans, it's low light.

02:56:15.530 --> 02:56:17.810
Aside from the orange little patches you see

02:56:17.810 --> 02:56:21.070
of where the different colors of orange are,

02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:23.650
there is a 10-foot radius of bright light around it,

02:56:23.650 --> 02:56:26.040
and then it is low light everywhere else in the chamber.

02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:26.873
LIAM: Okay.

02:56:26.873 --> 02:56:29.830
SAM: Does low light means we cannot see anything, or...

02:56:29.830 --> 02:56:32.339
MATT: No, it just means for perception checks,

02:56:32.339 --> 02:56:34.530
it's at disadvantage.

02:56:34.530 --> 02:56:37.557
At a certain point for details beyond that...

02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:41.980
Range attacks might be involved, but, you know,

02:56:41.980 --> 02:56:43.190
let's see when we get there.

02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:44.960
So, anyway, Beauregard. What are you doing?

02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:49.400
MARISHA: Wow. I just lost feeling in my knees.

02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:52.758
I would like to swim up to it, I guess.

02:56:52.758 --> 02:56:56.066
I would like to swim up to it, I guess.

02:56:56.066 --> 02:57:00.735
MATT: Right up front here?
SAM: God punching.

02:57:00.735 --> 02:57:03.733
MARISHA: (stammering)

02:57:03.733 --> 02:57:06.080
How much speed was that to get there?

02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:07.139
MATT: To get there?

02:57:07.139 --> 02:57:09.450
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: 25.

02:57:09.450 --> 02:57:12.920
MARISHA: Okay. Can I get on top of his head?

02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:14.960
Can I get on above it?

02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:16.903
MATT: Sure, yeah, I'll let you do that,

02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:20.050
since you have enough speed as a Monk.

02:57:20.050 --> 02:57:22.420
SAM: Jeez.
MARISHA: (exhales)

02:57:22.420 --> 02:57:25.980
MATT: So as you swim up over, as you rush up over,

02:57:25.980 --> 02:57:28.350
you feel the heat blasting out of its mouth

02:57:28.350 --> 02:57:30.900
as it lights up the front of Beau as you skid past,

02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:33.770
the water around its mouth itself is almost boiling.

02:57:33.770 --> 02:57:36.010
As you move up, you see the four eyes in the head

02:57:36.010 --> 02:57:39.150
(clicking) clock you as you swim past them,

02:57:39.150 --> 02:57:42.648
and then above you can see the massive collection

02:57:42.648 --> 02:57:46.231
of coins and knickknacks and pottery

02:57:46.231 --> 02:57:49.056
of coins and knickknacks and pottery

02:57:49.056 --> 02:57:52.450
and weird furniture, all sorts of all things

02:57:52.450 --> 02:57:55.033
that have been collected over time by Vokodo.

02:57:55.033 --> 02:57:56.417
What are you doing?

02:57:56.417 --> 02:57:57.610
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:57:57.610 --> 02:58:00.070
I'm legitimately light-headed.

02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:05.200
I'm going to swim up over him, and I'm going to try and use

02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:07.090
one of the things that's attached to his back

02:58:07.090 --> 02:58:08.970
to give me some leverage

02:58:08.970 --> 02:58:12.800
to come down and power-bomb him from above.

02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:14.539
MATT: Go for it.
ASHLEY: Yes!

02:58:14.539 --> 02:58:15.761
MATT: (thudding)
LIAM: (bubbling)

02:58:15.761 --> 02:58:17.390
MATT: Both fists out.
MARISHA: What are we doing?

02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:19.839
Oh god!

02:58:19.839 --> 02:58:21.530
(gasping) Pop pop!

02:58:22.414 --> 02:58:23.547
Okay!

02:58:24.552 --> 02:58:25.530
27

02:58:25.530 --> 02:58:27.590
and 18.
MATT: Both hit.

02:58:27.590 --> 02:58:29.080
LAURA: Oh, that's good!
TRAVIS: 18 hits.

02:58:29.080 --> 02:58:30.938
MARISHA: 18 hits.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

02:58:30.938 --> 02:58:32.727
TALIESIN: Low AC.
LIAM: (Cartman voice) Come on, you guys.

02:58:32.727 --> 02:58:34.022
Let's kill Vokodo.

02:58:34.022 --> 02:58:37.188
MARISHA: (exhales shakily)
LAURA: (laughs)

02:58:37.188 --> 02:58:40.763
MARISHA: First attack.

02:58:43.165 --> 02:58:44.600
Yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:47.908
First attack is an eight, so that's cool.

02:58:48.816 --> 02:58:51.660
14 damage. Stunning Strike.

02:58:51.660 --> 02:58:55.542
MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning damage, Stunning Strike.

02:58:55.542 --> 02:58:57.140
Ah, all right.

02:58:57.140 --> 02:58:59.180
He's going to go ahead and use a Legendary Resistance

02:58:59.180 --> 02:59:02.740
to not be stunned.
TRAVIS: Legendary Resistance.

02:59:02.740 --> 02:59:05.280
MARISHA: One Resistance down! So nervous.

02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:07.530
LAURA: Has he got three Resistances per round,

02:59:07.530 --> 02:59:09.040
or three Resistances?
SAM: We don't know.

02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:10.408
MATT: You don't know.
LAURA: (groaning)

02:59:10.408 --> 02:59:11.442
SAM: But he just used a Resistance.

02:59:11.442 --> 02:59:12.305
TRAVIS: I love it when you give us

02:59:12.305 --> 02:59:13.603
the nonchalant, "You don't know."

02:59:13.603 --> 02:59:14.490
I love it.
MARISHA: He just used one.

02:59:14.490 --> 02:59:18.063
TRAVIS: The wiggle that comes with it.
MARISHA: With the Stunning Strike. Second attack.

02:59:18.063 --> 02:59:18.896
Wow.

02:59:18.896 --> 02:59:21.650
The opposite in the spectrum, seven damage.

02:59:21.650 --> 02:59:22.840
MATT: Okay. Seven damage.

02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:24.507
MARISHA: A Stunning Strike.

02:59:27.736 --> 02:59:29.230
MATT: Success.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:59:29.230 --> 02:59:31.500
MATT: It's a 16, right? What's your DC on that?

02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:32.957
MARISHA: 16.
MATT: 16.

02:59:36.380 --> 02:59:38.080
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.
MATT: Go for it.

02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:40.100
MARISHA: For my bonus.
ASHLEY: Let's go.

02:59:40.100 --> 02:59:41.258
MATT: Each of these punches, by the way,

02:59:41.258 --> 02:59:42.890
as you're punching him in the side,

02:59:42.890 --> 02:59:46.006
it's like (punching) searing your knuckles.

02:59:46.006 --> 02:59:47.147
MARISHA: (exhales)

02:59:47.147 --> 02:59:52.147
(stammering) Water shouldn't be this hot.

02:59:52.680 --> 02:59:56.032
Okay, it's bad.

02:59:57.090 --> 02:59:59.990
21 on the first one.
MATT: That hits.

02:59:59.990 --> 03:00:02.960
MARISHA: And 13 on the second.
MATT: 13 misses.

03:00:02.960 --> 03:00:04.620
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: But the first one does hit.

03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:05.870
Go ahead and roll damage.

03:00:06.800 --> 03:00:08.930
SAM: What'd you roll on the first one?

03:00:08.930 --> 03:00:10.090
MARISHA: 21.
LAURA: 21.

03:00:10.090 --> 03:00:11.048
18 hit, though.

03:00:11.048 --> 03:00:13.180
TALIESIN: 18, 13 is what we're at right now.

03:00:13.180 --> 03:00:15.610
MARISHA: And...
LIAM: Go, Beau.

03:00:15.610 --> 03:00:18.290
SAM: Voko<i>do</i>-regard!
(laughter)

03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:21.876
MARISHA: Oh no you Voko-don't-regard!
(laughter)

03:00:21.876 --> 03:00:24.120
(laughs) 10 damage?

03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:26.570
MATT: 10 points of damage, bludgeoning.

03:00:26.570 --> 03:00:30.140
MARISHA: And Extra Aspects.
MATT: Okay.

03:00:30.140 --> 03:00:32.850
So, all three hits and you pull back,

03:00:32.850 --> 03:00:35.170
and the burning sensation

03:00:35.170 --> 03:00:36.990
from all the blows you laid into him

03:00:36.990 --> 03:00:39.510
do seven points of fire damage, total.

03:00:39.510 --> 03:00:44.110
With each hit, the sheer temperature

03:00:44.110 --> 03:00:48.800
of the surface of his hardened exterior burns your knuckles.

03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:50.601
It's like (burning)

03:00:50.601 --> 03:00:51.650
And as soon as you walk away, like,

03:00:51.650 --> 03:00:54.080
"Ah, fuck, that hurt!"

03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:57.980
So just know that hitting it with a melee hit

03:00:57.980 --> 03:00:59.486
seems to to burn you back.

03:00:59.486 --> 03:01:02.590
MARISHA: (groans) It burns, it burns! He burns!

03:01:02.590 --> 03:01:04.220
MATT: You do learn that he is resistant

03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:05.730
to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing

03:01:05.730 --> 03:01:07.810
from non-magical attacks,

03:01:07.810 --> 03:01:11.600
is resistant to cold damage.
MARISHA: Resistant to cold damage?

03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:13.525
MATT: And is immune to fire damage.

03:01:13.525 --> 03:01:14.977
MARISHA: Ooh, okay.

03:01:16.835 --> 03:01:18.490
TALIESIN: Not vulnerable to anything?

03:01:18.490 --> 03:01:19.760
MATT: Not vulnerable to anything, no.

03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:21.290
MARISHA: I just shout out:

03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:24.520
Obviously, think he's immune to fire.

03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:27.000
Surprisingly, resistant to cold.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:28.450
Didn't see that one coming.

03:01:29.350 --> 03:01:30.240
And then that's my turn.

03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:32.290
SAM: Thanks for the commentary.
MATT: There you go.

03:01:32.290 --> 03:01:34.290
That finishes Marisha. Caleb, you're up.

03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:38.120
LIAM: I'm going to just pull out the Driftglobe

03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:40.560
and say "Fajar"

03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:43.150
and cast Daylight--
(laughter)

03:01:43.150 --> 03:01:44.590
It's right here on the paper.
MATT: Yeah.

03:01:44.590 --> 03:01:45.970
LIAM: Fajar.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:01:45.970 --> 03:01:48.200
LIAM: I cast Daylight here inside the chamber.

03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:50.840
And then I would like to shimmy towards the right

03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:54.570
to try to block myself somewhat from his gaze.

03:01:54.570 --> 03:01:56.050
MATT: Over here?
LIAM: Yeah.

03:01:56.050 --> 03:01:57.790
SAM: Is there a gaze we should be worried about?

03:01:57.790 --> 03:02:00.092
MATT: One, two, three's as much as you can move.

03:02:00.092 --> 03:02:01.142
LIAM: Just line of sight.

03:02:02.150 --> 03:02:04.180
MATT: You're swimming 15 feet with movement.

03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:05.690
LIAM: Yeah. Right.

03:02:05.690 --> 03:02:07.400
MATT: Are you going up at all or are you staying low,

03:02:07.400 --> 03:02:09.220
just try and block off from the--?

03:02:09.220 --> 03:02:11.160
LIAM: Yeah, I will. I will go on a diagonal.

03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:12.811
TRAVIS: I will.
MATT: A diagonal? All right.

03:02:12.811 --> 03:02:17.811
That'll put you about there.

03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:19.730
ASHLEY: Fajar?
MATT: You've got it.

03:02:19.730 --> 03:02:20.970
LIAM: Fajar.
ASHLEY: Fajar!

03:02:22.303 --> 03:02:23.510
MARISHA: Fajarna.

03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:26.168
MATT: Initiative count 20, lair action first.

03:02:26.168 --> 03:02:27.351
LAURA: Oh, no!

03:02:27.351 --> 03:02:28.184
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:02:28.184 --> 03:02:30.420
TALIESIN: Paid the salt.

03:02:30.420 --> 03:02:32.596
LIAM: This is fine.
ASHLEY: Oh, god. I'm getting nervous.

03:02:32.596 --> 03:02:35.346
LAURA: (laughs)

03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:38.650
LIAM: Remember when we spent two episodes preparing for this

03:02:38.650 --> 03:02:42.270
and it made no impact?
(laughter)

03:02:42.270 --> 03:02:44.980
SAM: Oh no. Laura Bailey, why?

03:02:44.980 --> 03:02:46.470
MATT: In this vicinity--
ASHLEY: Oh.

03:02:46.470 --> 03:02:48.900
MARISHA: We tried so hard to be good.
TRAVIS: What?

03:02:48.900 --> 03:02:51.520
MATT: This strange wave of psychic energy

03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:54.240
emanates from the side of the wall.

03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:55.940
LIAM: Nope.
MATT: And causes all of you

03:02:55.940 --> 03:03:00.260
to briefly shoot your attention straight towards Vokodo.

03:03:00.260 --> 03:03:03.130
I need everyone except for Caleb and Veth

03:03:03.130 --> 03:03:06.620
to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

03:03:06.620 --> 03:03:08.170
SAM: Hey!

03:03:08.170 --> 03:03:09.860
TRAVIS: Advantage!
ASHLEY: Advantage, okay.

03:03:09.860 --> 03:03:11.520
SAM: Also, for everyone who took a long rest,

03:03:11.520 --> 03:03:14.250
it might have gotten rid of your temporary hit points,

03:03:14.250 --> 03:03:17.076
so put those back up there.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

03:03:17.076 --> 03:03:18.430
MATT: Everyone has nine temporary hit points.

03:03:18.430 --> 03:03:21.010
TRAVIS: Oh, good, good, good. 18.

03:03:21.010 --> 03:03:24.030
MATT: 18. Jester?
LAURA: 27.

03:03:24.030 --> 03:03:25.120
SAM: Ooh!

03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:26.750
LIAM: I'm out of the way.
MATT: Yeah. Yasha?

03:03:26.750 --> 03:03:27.738
ASHLEY: 13.
SAM: Balls.

03:03:27.738 --> 03:03:29.490
TALIESIN: 29.

03:03:29.490 --> 03:03:33.030
MATT: 29. Beauregard?
MARISHA: You didn't call me.

03:03:33.030 --> 03:03:33.960
MATT: Oh, right, because you weren't there.

03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:35.555
You're right.
MARISHA: I'm on his head.

03:03:35.555 --> 03:03:38.620
MATT: So, as all of you shift and look,

03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:39.710
you all shake it from view.

03:03:39.710 --> 03:03:43.010
However, Yasha, your vision suddenly begins

03:03:43.010 --> 03:03:44.610
to blur and swirl towards it,

03:03:44.610 --> 03:03:46.640
and there's something alluring.

03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:49.110
ASHLEY: I have no wisdom.
MATT: And for the time being,

03:03:49.110 --> 03:03:50.180
you are hypnotized.

03:03:50.180 --> 03:03:51.613
You are charmed by it.

03:03:51.613 --> 03:03:53.612
(groaning)

03:03:53.612 --> 03:03:57.040
MATT: On your turn, you're trying to get as close to it

03:03:57.040 --> 03:03:58.340
as you possibly can.

03:03:58.340 --> 03:04:00.520
You can only use your action to dash towards it.

03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:01.630
LIAM: Man.

03:04:01.630 --> 03:04:03.520
MATT: Until you're within five feet.

03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:04.410
At the end of each of your turns,

03:04:04.410 --> 03:04:05.720
you get to try and save from it.

03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:06.850
Right now, when it comes to your turn,

03:04:06.850 --> 03:04:09.450
all you can do is just get as close to it as you can.

03:04:09.450 --> 03:04:11.730
Similar to when you first entered these tunnels,

03:04:11.730 --> 03:04:14.490
you just need to get to this creature.

03:04:14.490 --> 03:04:15.870
It's drawing you towards it.

03:04:15.870 --> 03:04:17.670
TRAVIS: We might have to hit you.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:04:19.770 --> 03:04:21.320
Okay. Well, I'm going to go to it.

03:04:22.340 --> 03:04:23.510
MATT: Ah, well it's not your turn yet.

03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:25.102
ASHLEY: Oh, I am so sorry.

03:04:25.102 --> 03:04:27.252
LAURA: Oh, at the end of it?
LIAM: That's how charmed you are.

03:04:27.252 --> 03:04:29.250
MATT: That's the lair action.

03:04:29.250 --> 03:04:31.960
Now it's Vilya and Vokodo.

03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:33.360
Both actually rolled the same initiative.

03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:35.085
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay.

03:04:35.085 --> 03:04:36.390
MARISHA: They're working together!

03:04:36.390 --> 03:04:39.400
MATT: Vilya's a little bit higher on there,

03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:41.080
so she is going to go first.

03:04:42.090 --> 03:04:44.400
She, looking around in the space here,

03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:46.440
sees everyone's face shift.

03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:48.590
She also resists the effect.

03:04:48.590 --> 03:04:50.270
Looks about angrily, everything seems fine.

03:04:50.270 --> 03:04:52.140
She goes ahead and takes her staff,

03:04:52.140 --> 03:04:52.973
holds it in front of her,

03:04:52.973 --> 03:04:55.960
and begins swirling it overhead like this, and as it does,

03:04:55.960 --> 03:04:59.380
soot from the ground begins to lift up out of the ground

03:04:59.380 --> 03:05:00.920
and form these blackened clouds

03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:03.823
that begin to crackle over the top of this darkened chamber.

03:05:03.823 --> 03:05:06.182
(lightning crackling)

03:05:06.182 --> 03:05:09.890
She forms an underwater storm cloud

03:05:09.890 --> 03:05:11.740
LAURA: Shit!

03:05:11.740 --> 03:05:14.180
MARISHA: That's dope!
ASHLEY: So cool.

03:05:14.180 --> 03:05:16.575
TRAVIS: Water's a hell of a conductor, though.

03:05:16.575 --> 03:05:19.150
TALIESIN: Yeah. If we've learned anything about your mom,

03:05:19.150 --> 03:05:21.612
it's that water is not her favorite terrain.

03:05:21.612 --> 03:05:24.362
(groaning)

03:05:25.325 --> 03:05:26.985
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow!

03:05:26.985 --> 03:05:28.193
TALIESIN: It's been a rough month, Matt.

03:05:28.193 --> 03:05:29.690
TRAVIS: That was some millennia shade!

03:05:29.690 --> 03:05:32.470
MATT: She's going to cast it at 5th-level.

03:05:32.470 --> 03:05:33.303
SAM: 5th-level?

03:05:33.303 --> 03:05:34.886
MATT: She's casting it at 5th-level.

03:05:34.886 --> 03:05:36.330
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: And with her bonus action,

03:05:36.330 --> 03:05:39.060
she's going to transform into a killer whale,

03:05:39.060 --> 03:05:40.700
which I do not have a mini for.

03:05:40.700 --> 03:05:41.533
SAM: Ugh.

03:05:41.533 --> 03:05:42.615
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

03:05:42.615 --> 03:05:43.448
MATT: So instead I'm going to be using this,

03:05:43.448 --> 03:05:44.890
because it's roughly the size.

03:05:46.170 --> 03:05:47.820
That gives her a swim speed of 60,

03:05:47.820 --> 03:05:51.370
so she's going to go ahead and shift over here--

03:05:51.370 --> 03:05:53.610
LIAM: That gator is insane.
MATT: -- on to the side over there,

03:05:53.610 --> 03:05:54.730
and swimming up against the side.

03:05:54.730 --> 03:05:56.250
As this killer whale spins around,

03:05:56.250 --> 03:05:57.870
a bolt shoots down towards Vokodo,

03:05:57.870 --> 03:05:59.792
who has to making a dexterity saving throw.

03:05:59.792 --> 03:06:02.110
Makes it. Natural 18.

03:06:02.980 --> 03:06:06.920
However, that puts the damage at 6th-level to--

03:06:09.480 --> 03:06:13.350
Believe it's 5d10 points of lightning damage.

03:06:13.350 --> 03:06:15.420
SAM: Hey!
LAURA: Ooh.

03:06:15.420 --> 03:06:16.836
SAM: Go Vilya.

03:06:20.683 --> 03:06:22.690
TRAVIS: That's serious.

03:06:22.690 --> 03:06:24.156
MATT: Ooh, nice.

03:06:27.053 --> 03:06:29.570
TALIESIN: Can I do a thing?
MATT: 33 points of damage,

03:06:29.570 --> 03:06:32.385
reduced to 16.
ASHLEY: I know. I'm nervous eating.

03:06:32.385 --> 03:06:33.753
(laughter)

03:06:33.753 --> 03:06:35.390
MATT: 16 points of lightning damage.
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

03:06:35.390 --> 03:06:40.390
MATT: She's now a lightning storm-casting killer whale.

03:06:40.510 --> 03:06:43.660
Finishing Vilya's go, it is now Vokodo.

03:06:43.660 --> 03:06:46.170
The water is now getting to a subtle boil around you.

03:06:46.170 --> 03:06:48.350
While it's not damaging you this round, you gather

03:06:48.350 --> 03:06:50.250
it's probably going to start damaging you pretty soon

03:06:50.250 --> 03:06:53.060
just being in this chamber.

03:06:53.060 --> 03:06:57.073
But for Vokodo's turn, let's see what we got here.

03:06:59.176 --> 03:07:03.992
(dramatic battle music)

03:07:07.522 --> 03:07:11.260
Looking around at the space, the eye shifting,

03:07:11.260 --> 03:07:16.227
after it takes the blows from on top, to you, Beauregard,

03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:19.550
and then angrily, two of the eyes glare up towards you,

03:07:19.550 --> 03:07:22.915
and the voice gutturally growls within and goes,

03:07:22.915 --> 03:07:25.638
"(groans) Can't have that."

03:07:26.490 --> 03:07:29.430
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me.

03:07:29.430 --> 03:07:32.150
TRAVIS: Fucking shit. Come on, Beau!

03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:35.350
MARISHA: Thank god for these Heroes' Feasts, man.

03:07:36.210 --> 03:07:39.950
Okay, I rolled a 19 and an 18.
SAM: Whoa!

03:07:39.950 --> 03:07:44.950
MARISHA: So my Wisdom save is plus four, so 23 total.

03:07:45.330 --> 03:07:48.910
MATT: (dejected) Yeah, that'll do it.
(laughter)

03:07:48.910 --> 03:07:51.590
SAM: You angered the god Vokodo.
MARISHA: Lucky roll, lucky roll.

03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:53.640
MATT: So, as the two eyes look towards you,

03:07:53.640 --> 03:07:56.410
you feel this psychic wave strike your brain

03:07:56.410 --> 03:07:59.020
and for a second, you feel like something

03:07:59.020 --> 03:08:01.880
is trying to grasp hold of your will,

03:08:01.880 --> 03:08:04.750
and you remember yourself back on that shoreline,

03:08:04.750 --> 03:08:07.073
meditating on the Menagerie Coast, and--

03:08:07.073 --> 03:08:09.510
(shattering) you shatter that hold.

03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:11.685
No effect.

03:08:11.685 --> 03:08:14.733
MARISHA: I just say: Ew, your
eyes can look backwards. Gross.

03:08:14.733 --> 03:08:17.170
(laughter)

03:08:17.170 --> 03:08:20.040
MARISHA: With that, he's going to attempt to move backward,

03:08:20.040 --> 03:08:22.110
like an octopus. (water rushing)

03:08:22.110 --> 03:08:22.943
Swirl back.

03:08:22.943 --> 03:08:25.180
You do get to take a reaction if you want to.

03:08:25.180 --> 03:08:27.005
MARISHA: Yes, I do.

03:08:30.358 --> 03:08:33.420
Yeah, 25 to hit.
MATT: 25 hits.

03:08:33.420 --> 03:08:35.910
Go ahead and roll damage, and Sentinel--

03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:38.400
MARISHA: Sentinel, he's not going anywhere.

03:08:38.400 --> 03:08:41.487
11 damage.
MATT: 11 points of damage, okay.

03:08:41.487 --> 03:08:42.430
So he tries to move back,

03:08:42.430 --> 03:08:44.740
and Beauregard punches right back down in the head,

03:08:44.740 --> 03:08:47.432
taking another three points of fire damage.

03:08:48.850 --> 03:08:51.820
But in doing so, the eyes curl in

03:08:51.820 --> 03:08:53.250
and look back in different directions,

03:08:53.250 --> 03:08:55.840
briefly shaken, and it stays in place.

03:08:55.840 --> 03:08:58.310
You can now feel just the space around it

03:08:58.310 --> 03:09:02.727
is vibrating with anger.
(growling)

03:09:03.810 --> 03:09:05.460
That's going to end Vokodo's turn.

03:09:05.460 --> 03:09:09.390
Yasha, for your turn, you spend the entirety of it

03:09:09.390 --> 03:09:12.020
swimming forward and getting as close as you can to Vokodo,

03:09:12.020 --> 03:09:14.380
which is right up there,

03:09:14.380 --> 03:09:15.630
and you just stand there and stare.

03:09:15.630 --> 03:09:19.000
You all watch as Yasha just floating in the water,

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.470
stares, head slightly cocked to the side,

03:09:21.470 --> 03:09:23.890
either enthralled by the jewelry on its back

03:09:23.890 --> 03:09:26.040
or the actual entity itself.

03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:28.380
I need you, Yasha, to go ahead and make

03:09:28.380 --> 03:09:31.200
a Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn.

03:09:31.200 --> 03:09:34.150
TALIESIN: With advantage?
MATT: With advantage.

03:09:34.150 --> 03:09:35.990
This Heroes' Feast is going to save your guys' fucking ass,

03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:37.400
I swear to god.

03:09:37.400 --> 03:09:38.530
ASHLEY: Cocked.

03:09:38.530 --> 03:09:41.396
MARISHA: Shake it, shake it!

03:09:41.396 --> 03:09:42.870
TRAVIS: Shake it good.

03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:44.920
ASHLEY: 15?

03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:46.180
Nothing?
TALIESIN: Nothing, oh!

03:09:46.180 --> 03:09:50.579
MATT: 15 does not succeed.
ASHLEY: (growling)

03:09:50.579 --> 03:09:51.720
You stand there holding your space,

03:09:51.720 --> 03:09:55.053
still glaring at it.

03:09:56.567 --> 03:09:57.403
ASHLEY: All right.

03:09:57.403 --> 03:09:59.485
MATT: At the end of your turn,

03:09:59.485 --> 03:10:01.310
it's going to go ahead and use a Legendary Action,

03:10:01.310 --> 03:10:03.720
since you're right up in its face now,

03:10:03.720 --> 03:10:06.290
to use its bite attack.
MARISHA: Shuck in the nose.

03:10:06.290 --> 03:10:09.130
MATT: So as you're right there, its jaws begin to open,

03:10:09.130 --> 03:10:11.510
and you can see the elongated, pointed,

03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:13.230
almost obsidian-like teeth,

03:10:13.230 --> 03:10:15.190
reveal this bright yellow light

03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:16.620
that burns from the inside,

03:10:16.620 --> 03:10:18.660
like the heat itself has become like

03:10:18.660 --> 03:10:20.260
the front of a hooded lantern,

03:10:20.260 --> 03:10:22.040
but intensely more bright.

03:10:22.040 --> 03:10:24.520
You watch as Yasha's framed in dark shadow,

03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:26.250
from your guys' perspective behind her,

03:10:26.250 --> 03:10:29.030
before it (growls) lurches forward

03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:30.862
to try and bite down on her.

03:10:30.862 --> 03:10:32.260
MARISHA: The deadlights.

03:10:32.260 --> 03:10:34.551
MATT: That is going to be a...

03:10:36.568 --> 03:10:38.074
22 to hit.

03:10:38.074 --> 03:10:40.523
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

03:10:40.523 --> 03:10:44.963
As it bites down on you, Yasha, you take...

03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:50.510
TRAVIS: You don't need all those
dice. You can just use half.

03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:52.050
MATT: 17 points of slashing damage.

03:10:52.050 --> 03:10:53.620
SAM: Oof!
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:10:53.620 --> 03:10:55.300
MATT: Plus 10 points of fire damage.

03:10:55.300 --> 03:10:56.900
TRAVIS: Great.
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:10:59.040 --> 03:11:01.620
MATT: And that's its Legendary Action on that round.

03:11:01.620 --> 03:11:04.478
Finishing Yasha's go. Jester, you're up.

03:11:05.425 --> 03:11:10.420
LAURA: (sighs) Okay. Um...

03:11:10.420 --> 03:11:12.246
TRAVIS: (stammering)

03:11:13.080 --> 03:11:16.610
LAURA: This is going to-- (groans)

03:11:18.900 --> 03:11:22.320
I'm going to try to use up some of his...

03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:24.260
I'm going to cast Command.

03:11:24.260 --> 03:11:25.620
MATT: Cast Command on him?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:11:25.620 --> 03:11:27.170
MATT: Okay. What are you commanding?

03:11:27.170 --> 03:11:29.230
SAM: Drown. (laughs)
MATT: (laughs)

03:11:29.230 --> 03:11:30.870
LAURA: Grovel!

03:11:30.870 --> 03:11:31.810
MATT: Grovel.
SAM: Oh!

03:11:31.810 --> 03:11:33.110
MATT: Okay, that's a Wisdom saving throw?

03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:34.301
LAURA: Yeah.

03:11:36.010 --> 03:11:38.550
MATT: 16. What's your DC?

03:11:38.550 --> 03:11:40.110
LAURA: 17!
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:11:40.110 --> 03:11:41.618
MATT: 17?

03:11:43.990 --> 03:11:47.240
Yeah, he'll grovel.
TRAVIS: (gasping)

03:11:51.018 --> 03:11:52.870
TRAVIS: You sound like you're not sweating it, though.

03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:54.900
MARISHA: I know. I know.

03:11:54.900 --> 03:11:55.950
TALIESIN: Are we starting this shit now,

03:11:55.950 --> 03:11:59.410
or are we waiting around?
SAM: What? Starting what?

03:11:59.410 --> 03:12:02.310
MATT: So, next turn it'll fall prone and end its turn.

03:12:02.310 --> 03:12:04.240
MARISHA: In terms of...
TRAVIS: He falls prone, like

03:12:04.240 --> 03:12:07.070
to the floor of the cavern?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:08.620
LAURA: Yeah, and he'll end his...

03:12:08.620 --> 03:12:10.860
So he won't take a turn?
MATT: He'll lose a turn.

03:12:10.860 --> 03:12:13.660
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: He would rather lose a turn.

03:12:13.660 --> 03:12:15.650
MATT: He still has Legendary Actions, though.

03:12:15.650 --> 03:12:16.483
SAM: Yeah.

03:12:16.483 --> 03:12:17.728
ASHLEY: How many Legendary Actions does he have?

03:12:17.728 --> 03:12:19.515
LIAM: We don't know.
LAURA: We don't know.

03:12:19.515 --> 03:12:20.371
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: Don't know.

03:12:20.371 --> 03:12:22.328
MATT: All right. Does that finish your go, Jester?

03:12:22.328 --> 03:12:23.367
LAURA: Um.

03:12:23.367 --> 03:12:24.620
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:26.210
LAURA: I'm going to move.

03:12:26.210 --> 03:12:28.500
MATT: Where are you moving?
LAURA: I'm going to swim.

03:12:30.074 --> 03:12:32.424
I just want to not be in the cone.

03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:39.380
Can I swim towards Caleb and up?

03:12:40.330 --> 03:12:42.713
MATT: Towards Caleb and up? Okay.

03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:45.700
Full 15 feet at an angle, you mean?

03:12:45.700 --> 03:12:46.610
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

03:12:47.620 --> 03:12:49.230
We'll say that'll put you about there.

03:12:49.230 --> 03:12:51.050
LAURA: Okay, I don't know.

03:12:51.050 --> 03:12:54.240
And I'm going to send my duplicate

03:12:54.240 --> 03:12:57.250
the full movement that I can towards Vokodo.

03:12:57.250 --> 03:13:00.620
MATT: That'll be about there. Also higher up?

03:13:00.620 --> 03:13:02.140
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

03:13:02.140 --> 03:13:03.710
LAURA: I want her to come up underneath him,

03:13:03.710 --> 03:13:06.407
like under his belly, if she can.
MATT: Under his belly? Okay.

03:13:06.407 --> 03:13:08.411
I'll just say you're right there,

03:13:08.411 --> 03:13:09.910
and we'll understand it's under the belly.

03:13:10.780 --> 03:13:12.950
You got it. All right, end of your turn.

03:13:12.950 --> 03:13:15.190
Vokodo's going to go ahead and
use two of the Legendary Actions

03:13:15.190 --> 03:13:17.130
to use Reflexive Magic.

03:13:17.130 --> 03:13:18.620
LAURA: Well, she's not going to be directly underneath him

03:13:18.620 --> 03:13:19.453
if he's going to fall prone,

03:13:19.453 --> 03:13:21.480
so she's going to be, move back a little bit.

03:13:22.450 --> 03:13:25.010
MATT: Okay. So, there?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:13:25.010 --> 03:13:26.490
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Reflexive Magic?

03:13:26.490 --> 03:13:28.000
MATT: Gonna use Reflexive Magic.

03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:30.460
So it gets to cast a spell at fourth level or lower

03:13:30.460 --> 03:13:32.830
as a Legendary Action.
TRAVIS: Jesus.

03:13:32.830 --> 03:13:34.950
MATT: It's going to go ahead-- and you watch as Beauregard,

03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:36.390
you're right on top above it,

03:13:36.390 --> 03:13:38.720
and Yasha's right there in front of it.

03:13:38.720 --> 03:13:41.110
You watch the entire form of Vokodo just--

03:13:41.110 --> 03:13:42.130
(rushing water)

03:13:42.130 --> 03:13:43.560
Vanishes.
MARISHA: Why?

03:13:43.560 --> 03:13:45.500
LIAM: It was casting just then?
MATT: It was.

03:13:45.500 --> 03:13:48.280
LIAM: Could I have eyes on, or am I hidden?

03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:49.113
MATT: You would have eyes on.

03:13:49.113 --> 03:13:50.100
LIAM: Counterspell.
MARISHA: Yes!

03:13:50.100 --> 03:13:52.647
MATT: What's the range on Counterspell?

03:13:52.647 --> 03:13:55.360
SAM: 60?
LIAM: I think that's right, hold on.

03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:58.690
LAURA: 60?
LIAM: Yeah, it's 60 feet.

03:13:58.690 --> 03:14:00.610
MATT: 60 feet. Definitely within range.

03:14:00.610 --> 03:14:01.960
It's a fourth-level spell,

03:14:01.960 --> 03:14:05.030
so I need you to go ahead and roll--

03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:07.390
TRAVIS: Is he teleporting or going invisible?

03:14:07.390 --> 03:14:08.223
MATT: Hmm?
LAURA: We don't know.

03:14:08.223 --> 03:14:10.723
MATT: You don't know.
LIAM: No, I'll do it at fifth level.

03:14:10.723 --> 03:14:12.239
MARISHA: Oh shit.

03:14:12.239 --> 03:14:14.350
MATT: Okay. Okay.

03:14:14.350 --> 03:14:18.781
He stays put. You have Counterspelled his Dimension Door.

03:14:18.781 --> 03:14:21.694
TRAVIS: (gasping)

03:14:21.694 --> 03:14:24.040
TRAVIS: He was leaving, which...

03:14:24.040 --> 03:14:26.140
SAM: Maybe. Or maybe he was just bouncing around the room.

03:14:26.140 --> 03:14:27.690
LIAM: To a different place. Yeah, we don't know.

03:14:27.690 --> 03:14:29.920
MATT: All right. That finishes Jester's go.

03:14:29.920 --> 03:14:31.240
Veth, you're up. Caduceus, you're in back.

03:14:31.240 --> 03:14:32.660
SAM: Oh my god, I have to do something?

03:14:32.660 --> 03:14:33.980
MATT: Yeah, you do.

03:14:33.980 --> 03:14:36.688
SAM: I can't get within 30 feet of this dude, right?

03:14:38.194 --> 03:14:39.442
MATT: Yeah, you could get within 30 feet.

03:14:39.442 --> 03:14:41.420
SAM: Really?
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:14:41.420 --> 03:14:43.865
Were you hoping he was going to tell you no?

03:14:43.865 --> 03:14:46.790
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah. I can't do this, right?

03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:48.542
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

03:14:48.542 --> 03:14:50.120
ASHLEY: Can I just stay in my comfort zone?

03:14:50.120 --> 03:14:53.020
SAM: And how does Sneak Attack work?

03:14:53.020 --> 03:14:55.490
It's engaged with Beau, but...

03:14:55.490 --> 03:14:56.510
MATT: It's engaged with Beau.

03:14:56.510 --> 03:14:59.700
You have disadvantage on the attack roll.

03:14:59.700 --> 03:15:02.250
No, no, you don't, because it's a crossbow.

03:15:02.250 --> 03:15:03.170
SAM: Yes.
MATT: So you have a 30 feet--

03:15:03.170 --> 03:15:04.170
it's just a straight attack roll,

03:15:04.170 --> 03:15:07.040
and if it hits, because Beau and Yasha are within range,

03:15:07.040 --> 03:15:08.180
you do get Sneak Attack, at range.

03:15:08.180 --> 03:15:09.660
SAM: Okay.

03:15:09.660 --> 03:15:10.770
Okay, then, I'll do that.

03:15:10.770 --> 03:15:13.090
I will swim as far as I need to

03:15:13.090 --> 03:15:16.900
to be within 30 feet.
MATT: Okay. Five, 10.

03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:19.400
You're probably swimming past Jester.

03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:20.233
SAM: Sure.

03:15:20.233 --> 03:15:22.268
MATT: And getting right about there.

03:15:23.833 --> 03:15:27.470
SAM: I will fire.
MATT: Go for it. Roll an attack.

03:15:27.470 --> 03:15:29.850
SAM: Okay, 22 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

03:15:29.850 --> 03:15:31.390
You can go ahead and roll damage.

03:15:31.390 --> 03:15:32.823
SAM: All right.

03:15:38.102 --> 03:15:41.293
Oh, boy. (sighs)

03:15:41.293 --> 03:15:45.207
(intense, dramatic music)

03:15:45.207 --> 03:15:48.140
SAM: Ay yai yai. 34 points of damage.

03:15:48.140 --> 03:15:50.549
MATT: 34 points of damage, nice.

03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:54.678
SAM: And then I will...

03:15:55.680 --> 03:15:58.640
I could hide, or go away?

03:15:58.640 --> 03:16:00.130
MATT: You have nothing to hide right now.

03:16:00.130 --> 03:16:02.070
You're out in the open after firing your crossbow

03:16:02.070 --> 03:16:03.200
to get close enough.
SAM: All right.

03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:04.520
I'll just shoot again.

03:16:04.520 --> 03:16:06.118
MATT: Go for it. Roll another attack.

03:16:06.118 --> 03:16:10.340
SAM: And this one, I'll do Sharpshooter.

03:16:10.340 --> 03:16:13.090
MATT: Okay, minus five to hit.
SAM: Yeah.

03:16:14.430 --> 03:16:16.650
SAM: 21.
MATT: 21 and then...

03:16:16.650 --> 03:16:18.940
SAM: So, 26.
MATT: Oh, then that does hit.

03:16:18.940 --> 03:16:21.233
Go ahead and roll damage with the plus 10 damage.

03:16:21.233 --> 03:16:23.813
SAM: (groaning)

03:16:23.813 --> 03:16:25.175
17 points.

03:16:26.670 --> 03:16:28.810
MATT: Aw!
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:16:28.810 --> 03:16:31.469
MATT: Only over 50 damage in one round, aw!

03:16:31.469 --> 03:16:32.540
(laughter)

03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:35.082
So as you fire a second time, both of them (whoosh)

03:16:35.082 --> 03:16:37.390
sink into the sides, and the bolts split in.

03:16:37.390 --> 03:16:40.690
You watch as the bolts heat up red,

03:16:40.690 --> 03:16:43.577
just being stuck in the side of a creature

03:16:43.577 --> 03:16:45.760
this high in temperature.

03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:49.761
But it (groans and growls)

03:16:49.761 --> 03:16:52.450
SAM: Uh-oh, doesn't like that. Oh god!

03:16:52.450 --> 03:16:55.100
MATT: All right, that's your turn.
SAM: Yep.

03:16:55.100 --> 03:16:57.400
MATT: Caduceus, you're up. Fjord, you're on deck.

03:16:57.400 --> 03:16:59.091
TALIESIN: Um...

03:17:00.791 --> 03:17:03.082
Quick, Caleb, are you going for it?

03:17:03.082 --> 03:17:06.741
About to go for it?
LIAM: (stammering)

03:17:06.741 --> 03:17:08.962
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:17:08.962 --> 03:17:11.262
MARISHA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Am I within 30 feet of...?

03:17:12.100 --> 03:17:15.450
MATT: You are just outside of 30-foot range.

03:17:15.450 --> 03:17:18.010
TALIESIN: Can I get to 30 feet?
MATT: You can, yeah.

03:17:18.010 --> 03:17:18.843
TALIESIN: Will I have room

03:17:18.843 --> 03:17:20.977
to try and take cover after getting there?

03:17:20.977 --> 03:17:24.660
MATT: You, no. (laughs)
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:17:24.660 --> 03:17:26.300
I'm right in the middle of a bunch of people, aren't I?

03:17:26.300 --> 03:17:29.160
LAURA: Yeah. We're just kind of clustered.
MATT: You could probably move here if you want to.

03:17:29.160 --> 03:17:31.620
TALIESIN: And still be 30?
MATT: Maybe.

03:17:31.620 --> 03:17:34.003
You can try it and we can measure when you do.

03:17:37.270 --> 03:17:39.000
TALIESIN: Fuck me, man. Okay.

03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:41.960
I hate it when you do that.
LAURA: (laughs)

03:17:41.960 --> 03:17:45.170
MATT: So either you take cover,
or not take cover and be sure.

03:17:45.170 --> 03:17:48.080
Your call.
TALIESIN: I'll not take cover.

03:17:48.080 --> 03:17:49.932
MATT: Okay.

03:17:49.932 --> 03:17:51.340
So you can move about there and be sure

03:17:51.340 --> 03:17:53.510
that you can get him in 30 feet.
LAURA: Oh, I feel so pukey, y'all.

03:17:53.510 --> 03:17:54.500
TALIESIN: Before I move there,

03:17:54.500 --> 03:17:56.628
I'm going to use my bonus action to turn invisible.

03:17:56.628 --> 03:17:58.110
ASHLEY: (sighing)
MATT: Okay.

03:17:58.110 --> 03:18:00.500
LAURA: Huh?
MATT: You vanish from sight,

03:18:00.500 --> 03:18:02.550
and then shift over--
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold

03:18:03.420 --> 03:18:07.000
a Divine Domain Channel Divinity

03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.790
for right before Caleb's attack.

03:18:09.790 --> 03:18:12.453
MATT: Okay, okay.
LIAM: Harsh one.

03:18:12.453 --> 03:18:13.460
Harsh spell, that's going to--
MATT: So you're holding an action

03:18:13.460 --> 03:18:15.593
to Channel Divinity for Caleb's attack.

03:18:15.593 --> 03:18:16.690
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:18:16.690 --> 03:18:20.383
So, yeah, whatever Caleb does will be double damage.

03:18:20.383 --> 03:18:21.280
MATT: Oh, for that one?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:18:21.280 --> 03:18:24.475
MATT: Does it say attack?
TALIESIN: It says the...

03:18:25.577 --> 03:18:26.627
MATT: It does not function on spells

03:18:26.627 --> 03:18:28.160
unless the spells have an attack roll.

03:18:28.160 --> 03:18:29.410
TALIESIN: Oh. Okay, never mind, then.

03:18:29.410 --> 03:18:30.243
I'm going to change my shit.

03:18:30.243 --> 03:18:31.580
MATT: More of a combat-based thing,

03:18:31.580 --> 03:18:34.510
or for spells that have an array

03:18:34.510 --> 03:18:35.570
or have an attack roll involved.

03:18:35.570 --> 03:18:38.103
TALIESIN: In that case, I'm going to

03:18:38.103 --> 03:18:41.094
attempt to cast Bane, then,

03:18:41.094 --> 03:18:42.640
on this thing, see if it sticks.

03:18:42.640 --> 03:18:43.710
MATT: Okay. What's the save on that?

03:18:43.710 --> 03:18:45.680
TALIESIN: 17.
MATT: 17 of which one?

03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:47.547
TALIESIN: Charisma.
MATT: Charisma, ooh.

03:18:49.530 --> 03:18:51.090
It rolled a natural 19, even though it doesn't have

03:18:51.090 --> 03:18:54.160
a huge bonus on it, so it does resist Bane, unfortunately.

03:18:55.010 --> 03:18:56.510
TALIESIN: It's all right.
MATT: Sorry.

03:18:56.510 --> 03:18:58.080
That's your action.

03:18:58.080 --> 03:19:00.290
TALIESIN: My bonus action was turn invisible, but--

03:19:00.290 --> 03:19:02.020
MATT: Right, so that's your turn.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:19:02.020 --> 03:19:03.580
MATT: Right, finishing Caduceus. Fjord, you're up.

03:19:03.580 --> 03:19:05.630
Beau, you're on deck for the top of the round.

03:19:05.630 --> 03:19:07.800
TRAVIS: I'm going to kick off the ocean floor

03:19:07.800 --> 03:19:12.620
and try and swim up behind this rock formation, trying to...

03:19:14.213 --> 03:19:16.850
Is that 30 feet? Can I get there in 30 feet?

03:19:16.850 --> 03:19:19.290
MATT: Yeah, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Yes, you can.

03:19:19.290 --> 03:19:24.060
TRAVIS: Okay. Before I slink behind that little spire there

03:19:24.060 --> 03:19:26.180
to break his line of sight with me, I'll fire--

03:19:26.180 --> 03:19:27.770
MATT: You can't quite break his line of sight with 30 feet,

03:19:27.770 --> 03:19:29.606
but you're right on the edge there.

03:19:29.606 --> 03:19:34.060
TRAVIS: Okay. Then I may keep my head above.

03:19:34.060 --> 03:19:35.650
I'll fire off two Eldritch Blasts

03:19:35.650 --> 03:19:37.070
and then I'll drop down low

03:19:37.070 --> 03:19:39.640
so that I'm behind that platform then,

03:19:39.640 --> 03:19:42.673
just so that I can stay low.
MATT: Okay.

03:19:42.673 --> 03:19:46.403
TRAVIS: Two Eldritch Blasts at him.
MATT: You got it.

03:19:47.953 --> 03:19:49.760
TRAVIS: That's a 22 to hit.

03:19:49.760 --> 03:19:52.190
MATT: That hits.
TRAVIS: Second one is...

03:19:52.190 --> 03:19:54.300
Oh, that's really good. A 28.

03:19:54.300 --> 03:19:57.840
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:19:57.840 --> 03:20:02.840
TRAVIS: Eight plus five, plus two is 15.

03:20:03.230 --> 03:20:06.763
15. That's total balls, but I can re-roll a one.

03:20:10.033 --> 03:20:12.090
30 points of force damage.

03:20:12.090 --> 03:20:13.140
SAM: Damn!
ASHLEY: Nice.

03:20:13.140 --> 03:20:15.729
SAM: Of fjorce damage.
TRAVIS: Fjorce damage.

03:20:15.729 --> 03:20:18.380
MATT: (laughs) And with that, you duck back down just below.

03:20:18.380 --> 03:20:19.630
We'll say it'll put you about there.

03:20:19.630 --> 03:20:21.432
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's great, yeah.

03:20:21.432 --> 03:20:22.265
MATT: So you don't get quite as far,

03:20:22.265 --> 03:20:23.230
but you use the rest of the movement

03:20:23.230 --> 03:20:24.557
to get back down.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:20:24.557 --> 03:20:26.180
MATT: Is that your turn?
TRAVIS: It is.

03:20:26.180 --> 03:20:28.160
Actually, I'm going to use my bonus
action before I duck down

03:20:28.160 --> 03:20:31.420
to cast Hexblade's Curse on Vokodo.

03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:32.930
You fucker!

03:20:32.930 --> 03:20:34.863
MATT: With that, he has been cursed.
TALIESIN: We all need

03:20:34.863 --> 03:20:38.105
convenient places to hang...

03:20:38.105 --> 03:20:40.050
(laughter)

03:20:40.050 --> 03:20:41.958
ASHLEY: Only a couple.

03:20:41.958 --> 03:20:43.589
MATT: There's quite a few options there.

03:20:43.589 --> 03:20:45.050
TALIESIN: A lot of coat hangers.
MATT: Okay.

03:20:45.050 --> 03:20:46.970
That finishes your go, Fjord.

03:20:46.970 --> 03:20:47.890
As you pull back behind,

03:20:47.890 --> 03:20:52.065
you can watch as some of the long-dead

03:20:53.506 --> 03:20:54.348
plant matter in here

03:20:54.348 --> 03:20:57.990
begins to bloom green and then shoot out,

03:20:57.990 --> 03:21:00.950
and sink into the crevices around its body

03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:02.010
as the curse takes hold,

03:21:02.010 --> 03:21:04.920
the Wild Mother now bound in there

03:21:04.920 --> 03:21:06.635
with the Warlock energy.

03:21:06.635 --> 03:21:08.300
TRAVIS: The Wild Mother has entered the fight.

03:21:08.300 --> 03:21:10.210
MATT: Indeed. All right, Beau, you're up.

03:21:10.210 --> 03:21:11.400
Caleb, you're on deck.

03:21:11.400 --> 03:21:14.540
MARISHA: All right. I am going to wait

03:21:14.540 --> 03:21:16.060
and rear up for my opportunity,

03:21:16.060 --> 03:21:17.960
and as soon as I see one of his tentacles

03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:20.080
whip overhead,

03:21:20.080 --> 03:21:21.640
I'm going to leap and jump off.

03:21:21.640 --> 03:21:23.910
I'm going to grab it swashbuckler-style,

03:21:23.910 --> 03:21:26.770
and use that to swing around and come back at him

03:21:26.770 --> 03:21:29.410
with a double donkey kick

03:21:29.410 --> 03:21:30.937
to the face!
MATT: Around that side?

03:21:30.937 --> 03:21:32.200
LAURA: Yeah!
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:21:32.200 --> 03:21:33.540
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: That works great.

03:21:33.540 --> 03:21:35.950
SAM: Is it all in slow motion because you're underwater?

03:21:35.950 --> 03:21:38.960
MARISHA: Yeah, just--
(laughter)

03:21:40.218 --> 03:21:41.920
MATT: Not for you, it's not slow motion.

03:21:41.920 --> 03:21:43.900
(laughter)

03:21:43.900 --> 03:21:46.960
MATT: As the tentacle rears back after the curse takes hold,

03:21:46.960 --> 03:21:49.140
you grab it in this giant swoop,

03:21:49.140 --> 03:21:51.590
and end up careening around--

03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:53.960
MARISHA: Can I do a little bicycle kick, pop pop?

03:21:53.960 --> 03:21:55.510
MATT: One bicycle kick to its side.

03:21:56.883 --> 03:21:59.150
TRAVIS: ♪ Bicycle ♪
ALL: ♪ Bicycle ♪

03:21:59.150 --> 03:22:04.150
MARISHA: That one's cocked, but this first one is 24.

03:22:04.500 --> 03:22:06.210
MATT: That hits.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

03:22:07.240 --> 03:22:10.320
God damn, that is shit dice rolls damage.

03:22:10.320 --> 03:22:12.200
Seven damage.
MATT: Seven damage.

03:22:13.090 --> 03:22:15.933
You take eight points of fire damage.

03:22:15.933 --> 03:22:17.818
LAURA: Ugh.

03:22:17.818 --> 03:22:21.040
MATT: Stunning Strike.
MARISHA: War of attrition right there.

03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:22.860
MATT: It's going to go ahead and use another Resistance.

03:22:22.860 --> 03:22:24.930
MARISHA: I have nothing to heal myself with.

03:22:24.930 --> 03:22:25.800
TALIESIN: I mean, anything long-range--

03:22:25.800 --> 03:22:27.360
MARISHA: He uses a Legendary Resistance?

03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:28.584
LAURA: Yeah, he did.

03:22:28.584 --> 03:22:29.572
TRAVIS: One.

03:22:29.572 --> 03:22:32.222
He used one this round.
LIAM: He used one, at the top.

03:22:35.250 --> 03:22:39.270
MATT: Yes he is. Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.

03:22:39.270 --> 03:22:41.060
TRAVIS: He's using another one?
MATT: Yes, he is.

03:22:41.060 --> 03:22:41.893
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:22:41.893 --> 03:22:43.892
MARISHA: So he's used two total?

03:22:43.892 --> 03:22:44.967
Right? I think.

03:22:44.967 --> 03:22:45.800
LAURA: Yeah.

03:22:46.677 --> 03:22:47.510
That we know of.

03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:48.482
SAM: He's used two?

03:22:48.482 --> 03:22:50.160
MARISHA: He has used two.

03:22:50.160 --> 03:22:51.872
MATT: I've seen some games where they don't even mention

03:22:51.872 --> 03:22:53.490
if a Legendary Resistance is used.

03:22:53.490 --> 03:22:54.950
They just let you guys figure it out.

03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:56.122
But I don't know.

03:22:56.122 --> 03:22:59.520
It's fun to let you guys strategize around it, so.

03:22:59.520 --> 03:23:01.922
TRAVIS: Yeah, because our strategy's
paying off fucking well.

03:23:01.922 --> 03:23:04.203
(laughter)

03:23:04.203 --> 03:23:05.970
TALIESIN: A bunch of squirrels running around.
MARISHA: 15?

03:23:05.970 --> 03:23:07.820
MATT: 15 misses it.
LAURA: Did we get it?!

03:23:07.820 --> 03:23:09.080
Did we get it?!

03:23:11.340 --> 03:23:12.773
MARISHA: 15 misses.

03:23:14.197 --> 03:23:15.900
What did he do last time?

03:23:15.900 --> 03:23:17.500
Okay. Yeah, you know what?

03:23:17.500 --> 03:23:19.980
Flurry of Blows. I'm going to do pop pop again.

03:23:19.980 --> 03:23:21.750
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: Shit, shit, shit.

03:23:21.750 --> 03:23:24.170
Stop, D&amp;D Beyond, stop--
SAM: Bob-ba-bob.

03:23:24.170 --> 03:23:26.132
MARISHA: Bob.
TRAVIS: Ba-ba-bob.

03:23:26.132 --> 03:23:28.100
MARISHA: So, while I'm there, I'm
going to try and swing around

03:23:28.100 --> 03:23:31.152
for two more kicks to his little squirmy eyeballs.

03:23:31.152 --> 03:23:33.620
Okay, okay.

03:23:33.620 --> 03:23:36.510
28 for the first one, and 19.
MATT: Both of those hit.

03:23:36.510 --> 03:23:38.714
MARISHA: All right.
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

03:23:38.714 --> 03:23:40.380
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:23:40.380 --> 03:23:42.960
LAURA: Is he stunned already?
MATT: No.

03:23:42.960 --> 03:23:45.970
MARISHA: 13 damage for the first one.
MATT: All right.

03:23:45.970 --> 03:23:48.100
MARISHA: And 11 damage for the second.

03:23:48.100 --> 03:23:49.240
MATT: Great.
MARISHA: So it's 24 total.

03:23:49.240 --> 03:23:52.130
MATT: You also take 14 points of fire damage.

03:23:52.130 --> 03:23:53.560
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Woof.

03:23:53.560 --> 03:23:55.440
MATT: So after you've impacted both the legs,

03:23:55.440 --> 03:23:57.030
you pull back and then, pop, pop!

03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:58.790
Hit him back inside the side of the chest.

03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:59.623
The whole side quivers,

03:23:59.623 --> 03:24:01.190
and you see coins being jingled loose.

03:24:01.190 --> 03:24:03.800
They begin to slowly fall and spin to the ground,

03:24:04.760 --> 03:24:05.593
and as you pull back,

03:24:05.593 --> 03:24:07.860
the knuckles are singed and burnt now.

03:24:07.860 --> 03:24:09.820
You can see there's a little bit of blood trails

03:24:09.820 --> 03:24:11.390
in the water as you pull back your fists.

03:24:11.390 --> 03:24:12.930
You're starting to bleed from the impact there.
LAURA: Oh no, Beau!

03:24:12.930 --> 03:24:15.590
MARISHA: Oh, they're getting those bubbly blisters.

03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:16.847
SAM: Ew.
MARISHA: You know where they bubble?

03:24:16.847 --> 03:24:19.139
SAM: Uh-huh.
MARISHA: Ah!

03:24:19.139 --> 03:24:21.130
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Beauregard?

03:24:21.130 --> 03:24:22.850
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. that does.
MATT: All right.

03:24:22.850 --> 03:24:23.790
Caleb, you're up.
LIAM: Oh, yeah.

03:24:23.790 --> 03:24:27.290
I'm going to swim 15 feet forward

03:24:27.290 --> 03:24:31.660
and try to poke my face through that platform.

03:24:31.660 --> 03:24:34.210
MATT: Over here?
LIAM: Yeah, that little gap there.

03:24:34.210 --> 03:24:36.240
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: And extend my hand out,

03:24:36.240 --> 03:24:38.550
holding a cocoon in my hand,

03:24:38.550 --> 03:24:42.750
and I'm going to cast Polymorph on him, on Vokodo.

03:24:42.750 --> 03:24:45.030
MATT: Okay, got it. That's a which save?

03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:47.370
LIAM: That is a wisdom save.
MATT: Wisdom save.

03:24:47.370 --> 03:24:49.450
SAM: And turn him into a dragon turtle.

03:24:49.450 --> 03:24:51.812
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: That is a 23.

03:24:51.812 --> 03:24:53.650
SAM: (groans)
LIAM: Big save.

03:24:53.650 --> 03:24:55.260
MATT: Worth a try.

03:24:55.260 --> 03:24:57.010
So as you come through and release it,

03:24:57.010 --> 03:24:58.890
one of the eyes looks towards you,

03:24:58.890 --> 03:24:59.940
and as the spell impacts,

03:24:59.940 --> 03:25:01.610
you see its form quake for a second

03:25:01.610 --> 03:25:03.800
and then resist it.

03:25:07.140 --> 03:25:09.370
TRAVIS: Lair.
MATT: However.

03:25:09.370 --> 03:25:10.953
Beauregard, I need you to make a wisdom save.

03:25:10.953 --> 03:25:11.786
MARISHA: All right.

03:25:13.070 --> 03:25:14.170
TRAVIS: C'mon, girl.

03:25:14.170 --> 03:25:16.060
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right.

03:25:16.060 --> 03:25:17.950
Cocked.

03:25:17.950 --> 03:25:18.900
LIAM: Lure her out.

03:25:18.900 --> 03:25:20.530
MARISHA: But that first one that wasn't cocked

03:25:20.530 --> 03:25:23.065
was an 18 anyway, so 22.

03:25:23.065 --> 03:25:24.720
MATT: 22, that does beat your DC.

03:25:25.977 --> 03:25:28.600
SAM: What?
MATT: So as you cast Polymorph,

03:25:28.600 --> 03:25:31.200
the effect blasts off his hide,

03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:33.780
and then reforms towards Beauregard

03:25:33.780 --> 03:25:37.050
and Beauregard, you suddenly resist an effect

03:25:37.050 --> 03:25:39.020
that's maybe trying to change and alter

03:25:39.020 --> 03:25:40.860
your physical form.

03:25:40.860 --> 03:25:42.510
SAM: Wait, you resisted it also?

03:25:42.510 --> 03:25:44.200
TRAVIS: Is that something that can happen,

03:25:44.200 --> 03:25:46.170
that spell can ricochet off of a--?

03:25:46.170 --> 03:25:49.600
MARISHA: With him? Is that with him?
LIAM: So she saved?

03:25:49.600 --> 03:25:51.670
MARISHA: I saved.
LAURA: Oh, god.

03:25:51.670 --> 03:25:53.570
MATT: And to that point, actually, just double-check.

03:25:53.570 --> 03:25:55.170
MARISHA: This guy's got a lot of
tricks up his sleeve, you guys.

03:25:55.170 --> 03:25:56.280
MATT: I forgot it earlier.

03:25:56.280 --> 03:25:57.113
Caduceus, if you can go ahead

03:25:57.113 --> 03:25:59.480
and make a charisma save for me.

03:25:59.480 --> 03:26:00.700
LIAM: It would've been really funny

03:26:00.700 --> 03:26:02.634
to see you turn into a giant crab, though.

03:26:02.634 --> 03:26:06.170
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah. Pop pop!

03:26:06.170 --> 03:26:08.090
TALIESIN: 20.
MATT: 20? Yeah, you're fine.

03:26:08.090 --> 03:26:10.140
Cool. All right, Caleb.

03:26:10.140 --> 03:26:11.360
That's your movement, that's your action.

03:26:11.360 --> 03:26:12.577
LIAM: Yeah, done.
MATT: You good? All right, Caleb's done.

03:26:12.577 --> 03:26:13.410
SAM: That's tricky.

03:26:13.410 --> 03:26:15.977
MATT: We are now back to the lair action.
TRAVIS: Redirecting?

03:26:15.977 --> 03:26:18.068
LAURA: That's tricksy.
TALIESIN: Oh, it's reflective.

03:26:20.102 --> 03:26:23.450
MATT: As a lair action, he gets a free Misty Step

03:26:23.450 --> 03:26:26.790
and is going to teleport 30 feet.

03:26:27.870 --> 03:26:30.670
MARISHA: Wait, is he moving?
MATT: This way. As part of the lair action.

03:26:30.670 --> 03:26:32.280
LIAM: Not a spell, it's a lair action, right?

03:26:32.280 --> 03:26:33.270
TRAVIS: You got Sentry on his ass, right?

03:26:33.270 --> 03:26:34.610
MATT: As a lair action,

03:26:34.610 --> 03:26:36.070
it gets to cast, so it is a spell.

03:26:36.070 --> 03:26:36.903
LIAM: Gets to cast?

03:26:36.903 --> 03:26:39.240
MARISHA: But it's him leaving my melee range.

03:26:39.240 --> 03:26:40.370
Do I still get to make an attack of opportunity?

03:26:40.370 --> 03:26:41.860
MATT: It's a teleport, so no, you would not.

03:26:41.860 --> 03:26:43.080
He just disappears.
TRAVIS: That's right.

03:26:43.080 --> 03:26:44.840
LIAM: I'm not going to.
MATT: Okay.

03:26:44.840 --> 03:26:46.330
LIAM: Not going to.
MATT: So with that,

03:26:46.330 --> 03:26:49.300
leaving Beauregard and Yasha behind...

03:26:50.360 --> 03:26:51.193
Oh, god.

03:26:51.193 --> 03:26:52.322
ASHLEY: Beau!

03:26:52.322 --> 03:26:55.080
MATT: And Beau falls over.
LAURA: Beau!

03:26:55.080 --> 03:26:57.722
MARISHA: Slow-mo falling.
LAURA: "Oh, I can swim."

03:26:57.722 --> 03:27:00.482
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

03:27:00.482 --> 03:27:03.950
MARISHA: Ah--! Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

03:27:03.950 --> 03:27:05.680
MATT: Teleports 30 feet back

03:27:05.680 --> 03:27:06.513
as part of Misty Step.

03:27:06.513 --> 03:27:08.270
You watch as he vanishes,

03:27:08.270 --> 03:27:11.936
and then suddenly this tiny little sparkle of fire goes

03:27:11.936 --> 03:27:14.019
across the water.
LAURA: Ooh.

03:27:14.019 --> 03:27:15.450
MATT: All of a sudden he apparates in place again.

03:27:15.450 --> 03:27:17.970
You watch all the water around him pull back

03:27:17.970 --> 03:27:20.920
and then immediately begin to shift.

03:27:20.920 --> 03:27:23.370
You can see the heat itself radiating

03:27:23.370 --> 03:27:25.930
is causing the visuals around him to warp.

03:27:27.160 --> 03:27:28.310
That's the lair action.

03:27:29.740 --> 03:27:32.000
Now it comes to Vilya's turn.
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:34.190
MATT: So Vilya--
SAM: She's a orca.

03:27:34.190 --> 03:27:35.840
TRAVIS: Killer whale.

03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:37.098
MATT: So she can do quite well over here.
ASHLEY: When is he up?

03:27:37.098 --> 03:27:38.650
When is Vokodo's turn?

03:27:38.650 --> 03:27:39.483
LAURA: After Vilya.

03:27:39.483 --> 03:27:40.630
SAM: Same time as Vilya.

03:27:40.630 --> 03:27:42.170
TALIESIN: But still has to--

03:27:42.170 --> 03:27:43.440
MATT: Range on Call Lightning is 120 feet,

03:27:43.440 --> 03:27:45.440
so she can do it from there.

03:27:45.440 --> 03:27:47.640
She's going to fly up a little higher,

03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:51.400
or swim up as an orca, so she has a visual,

03:27:51.400 --> 03:27:53.940
and is going to concentrate for a second.

03:27:53.940 --> 03:27:55.190
The head seems to dip down

03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:58.034
and the storm above goes (crackling, lightning striking)

03:27:58.034 --> 03:28:00.750
and strikes down next towards Vokodo,

03:28:00.750 --> 03:28:03.572
who fails his Dexterity saving throw.

03:28:03.572 --> 03:28:04.670
SAM: Damn.

03:28:09.216 --> 03:28:11.184
ASHLEY: (sighs)

03:28:11.184 --> 03:28:13.351
LAURA: Yep.
SAM: How many dice is that?

03:28:16.183 --> 03:28:19.560
MATT: 22, 25.

03:28:19.560 --> 03:28:22.190
So 25 points of lightning damage to Vokodo

03:28:22.190 --> 03:28:24.760
as the bolt strikes and hits him.

03:28:24.760 --> 03:28:26.760
That's going to finish her go there.

03:28:26.760 --> 03:28:28.780
TRAVIS: No redirecting of that spell?

03:28:28.780 --> 03:28:29.613
MATT: No.

03:28:31.420 --> 03:28:32.445
SAM: Good to know.

03:28:35.651 --> 03:28:38.980
LAURA: It's an attack spell.

03:28:38.980 --> 03:28:40.755
It's different.
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

03:28:40.755 --> 03:28:42.446
[intense music]

03:28:42.446 --> 03:28:44.780
SAM: (humming to music)

03:28:44.780 --> 03:28:46.990
TRAVIS: I'm still trying to figure out what's happening.

03:28:46.990 --> 03:28:48.730
MATT: I did forget one thing earlier,

03:28:48.730 --> 03:28:50.088
but it's my fault.

03:28:51.110 --> 03:28:53.810
So finishing Vilya's turn, it's now Vokodo's turn.

03:28:53.810 --> 03:28:57.520
The entire chamber has now become super heated.

03:28:57.520 --> 03:29:00.633
Every one of you within the chamber

03:29:00.633 --> 03:29:01.740
takes three points of fire damage.

03:29:01.740 --> 03:29:04.240
SAM: Come on, Vokodo.

03:29:04.240 --> 03:29:05.250
TRAVIS: Sam, shut up.

03:29:05.250 --> 03:29:06.930
SAM: You got to do better than that, Vokodo!

03:29:06.930 --> 03:29:07.900
LAURA: Don't!
TALIESIN: No.

03:29:07.900 --> 03:29:09.770
We don't agree with that.
ASHLEY: Don't listen to him.

03:29:09.770 --> 03:29:11.530
TRAVIS: He doesn't speak for us.

03:29:11.530 --> 03:29:13.140
We want you to die, but--

03:29:13.140 --> 03:29:15.095
MATT: At which point, while he's there,

03:29:15.095 --> 03:29:17.550
he tumbles to the ground,

03:29:17.550 --> 03:29:20.000
the successful Command causing him to grovel.

03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:22.920
He swims to the base of the chamber, right there.

03:29:22.920 --> 03:29:24.155
SAM: "You are super cool."

03:29:24.155 --> 03:29:26.350
MATT: And it is currently prone.

03:29:26.350 --> 03:29:27.570
SAM: Cool.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:29:27.570 --> 03:29:29.560
So does that mean melee attacks on it have advantage?

03:29:29.560 --> 03:29:30.410
MATT: Advantage, yes.

03:29:32.390 --> 03:29:33.890
That's going to go ahead and end his turn

03:29:33.890 --> 03:29:34.940
since it's all he can do.

03:29:34.940 --> 03:29:38.630
LAURA: Did the attacking Yasha break the charm on her,

03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:40.970
because she took physical damage?

03:29:40.970 --> 03:29:42.960
MATT: Ah, yes, go ahead and make another save.

03:29:42.960 --> 03:29:44.640
LAURA: But wouldn't it break it already?

03:29:44.640 --> 03:29:46.350
MATT: Doesn't break it. She gets to save.

03:29:46.350 --> 03:29:47.700
LIAM: She gets a save because of it.

03:29:47.700 --> 03:29:48.910
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Come on. Big money.

03:29:48.910 --> 03:29:51.110
TRAVIS: You get a wisdom save with advantage, right?

03:29:52.050 --> 03:29:52.883
ASHLEY: Say again?

03:29:52.883 --> 03:29:56.130
LIAM: Wisdom advantage, yeah.
ASHLEY: Goddamn it.

03:29:57.211 --> 03:29:58.350
MATT: No?

03:29:58.350 --> 03:29:59.800
ASHLEY: 12.
MATT: 12, no.

03:29:59.800 --> 03:30:02.620
You're still there staring forward towards it.

03:30:02.620 --> 03:30:04.340
ASHLEY: How fun.
MATT: That ends Vokodo's turn,

03:30:04.340 --> 03:30:05.330
currently prone on the ground,

03:30:05.330 --> 03:30:08.075
Commanded by a level one spell.

03:30:08.075 --> 03:30:10.100
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:30:10.100 --> 03:30:11.940
MATT: Ending that go, Yasha, it's your turn,

03:30:11.940 --> 03:30:15.410
and you spend your turn dashing as close as you can,

03:30:15.410 --> 03:30:16.710
right there, staring once more

03:30:16.710 --> 03:30:18.260
into the dead lights of Vokodo,

03:30:19.100 --> 03:30:20.000
as Marisha put it.

03:30:21.530 --> 03:30:24.270
Absorbed by what's in front of you,

03:30:25.110 --> 03:30:28.381
eyes wide, hypnotized.
ASHLEY: Try again, though.

03:30:28.381 --> 03:30:29.214
MATT: At the end of your turn,

03:30:29.214 --> 03:30:30.047
you can make another series of saves.

03:30:30.047 --> 03:30:32.130
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: Come on.

03:30:32.130 --> 03:30:34.060
MARISHA: With advantage.
ASHLEY: Gosh dang it!

03:30:34.060 --> 03:30:35.070
TRAVIS: Come on, here we go. This is it.

03:30:35.070 --> 03:30:38.160
MARISHA: This is the one.
ASHLEY: No, it's not! It's a five.

03:30:38.160 --> 03:30:40.013
MARISHA: What?
SAM: (laughs)

03:30:40.013 --> 03:30:42.525
ASHLEY: Ugh, that was advantage!

03:30:43.690 --> 03:30:46.240
MATT: All right, that brings us to

03:30:47.973 --> 03:30:49.830
Jester, with Veth on deck.

03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:52.650
SAM: Oh, I got to come up with something.

03:30:52.650 --> 03:30:55.650
ASHLEY: I'm rolling bad.
LAURA: Okay.

03:30:57.230 --> 03:31:01.500
LAURA: I'm going to have my duplicate swim towards him.

03:31:01.500 --> 03:31:02.550
MATT: Okay.

03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:04.910
LAURA: How close can she get?

03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:06.920
MATT: She can, because she's not altered

03:31:06.920 --> 03:31:08.270
by the speed of the water,

03:31:08.270 --> 03:31:12.153
she can get almost 10 feet away.

03:31:14.030 --> 03:31:15.800
LIAM: (as Jester) Diplomatic immunity.
MATT: (counting)

03:31:15.800 --> 03:31:17.280
Yeah, so 30 feet.

03:31:17.280 --> 03:31:19.430
It's still five feet away.
TRAVIS: Where's Yasha?

03:31:19.430 --> 03:31:20.920
LAURA: I'm scared of casting any spells.

03:31:20.920 --> 03:31:22.736
I'm afraid it's going to--

03:31:23.686 --> 03:31:24.950
LIAM: Right?

03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:26.583
LAURA: I'm going to try to cast--

03:31:27.555 --> 03:31:28.846
Fuck!

03:31:28.846 --> 03:31:31.423
TRAVIS: I don't know that spell.

03:31:31.423 --> 03:31:33.040
LAURA: (laughs)
MATT: I think you do.

03:31:33.040 --> 03:31:34.140
TRAVIS: Matt, can you point to where Yasha is?

03:31:34.140 --> 03:31:35.680
SAM: Fuck him!
MATT: Right there.

03:31:35.680 --> 03:31:36.513
TRAVIS: Got it.

03:31:36.513 --> 03:31:37.530
MATT: Right in the front of the face,

03:31:37.530 --> 03:31:39.180
just staring into the open mouth.

03:31:40.063 --> 03:31:44.213
LIAM: (growling)

03:31:47.050 --> 03:31:50.780
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command again.

03:31:50.780 --> 03:31:51.900
MATT: Cast Command again? Okay.

03:31:51.900 --> 03:31:54.020
What's the save on that? That's wisdom?

03:31:54.020 --> 03:31:55.750
LAURA: Yeah.

03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:57.333
MATT: That is going to be a 19.

03:31:58.210 --> 03:32:00.070
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Yeah. That succeeds.

03:32:00.070 --> 03:32:02.100
That's your action, and your bonus to move it,

03:32:02.100 --> 03:32:05.010
so you have your movement still if you want to move at all.

03:32:05.010 --> 03:32:06.640
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to swim around--

03:32:07.697 --> 03:32:09.089
(babbling)

03:32:09.089 --> 03:32:12.272
the base of where Fjord is.

03:32:12.272 --> 03:32:13.180
MATT: Okay.

03:32:13.180 --> 03:32:16.210
LAURA: I'm going to swim as far around it as I can.

03:32:16.210 --> 03:32:17.043
MATT: That's as far as you can get,

03:32:17.043 --> 03:32:18.510
unless you want to go up or down.

03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:21.097
LAURA: I'm going to stay up so I can see him

03:32:21.097 --> 03:32:24.680
just above the edge of that--

03:32:24.680 --> 03:32:25.513
Yeah, I can't.

03:32:25.513 --> 03:32:27.496
MATT: That's all good. I'll put you--

03:32:27.496 --> 03:32:29.630
LAURA: I think he won't get over there.

03:32:29.630 --> 03:32:32.396
MATT: Put you right there.

03:32:32.396 --> 03:32:33.722
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:32:33.722 --> 03:32:36.070
MATT: So you're just peeking over the edge.

03:32:36.070 --> 03:32:37.850
You've got it. All right, that finishes Jester's go.

03:32:37.850 --> 03:32:40.290
Veth, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

03:32:40.290 --> 03:32:42.343
SAM: What do I do?

03:32:42.343 --> 03:32:45.410
Oh, what do I do?

03:32:45.410 --> 03:32:46.930
I got to get within 30 feet,

03:32:46.930 --> 03:32:49.090
but he's moved 30 feet away,

03:32:50.670 --> 03:32:53.090
and I can only swim 15 feet, right?

03:32:53.090 --> 03:32:55.240
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Did I need to make a wisdom save or something

03:32:55.240 --> 03:32:57.900
to make sure it didn't do anything to somebody else?

03:32:59.050 --> 03:32:59.950
The Command spell?

03:33:00.810 --> 03:33:02.730
MATT: No, you don't have to make a wisdom save.

03:33:06.820 --> 03:33:07.653
Beauregard does.

03:33:07.653 --> 03:33:08.870
LIAM: Yeah.

03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:09.703
MARISHA: What?
MATT: Make a wisdom save.

03:33:09.703 --> 03:33:11.800
LIAM: You're getting a ricochet spell again.

03:33:11.800 --> 03:33:14.633
MARISHA: Oh, shit, okay.
TALIESIN: With advantage.

03:33:16.200 --> 03:33:18.140
MARISHA: Wisdom save?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:22.020
MARISHA: 13 plus four.
LAURA: 17?

03:33:22.020 --> 03:33:24.700
MARISHA: Is 17.
LAURA: So you succeed, 17.

03:33:24.700 --> 03:33:26.110
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

03:33:26.110 --> 03:33:27.260
MATT: Jester was about to shout a word,

03:33:27.260 --> 03:33:29.380
and for a second your concentration shifts towards her,

03:33:29.380 --> 03:33:31.470
and you shake it from your will.

03:33:32.860 --> 03:33:33.935
MARISHA: Grovel? Really?

03:33:33.935 --> 03:33:35.018
You want me to grovel right now?

03:33:35.018 --> 03:33:36.430
LAURA: No, no, I wasn't going to say grovel!

03:33:36.430 --> 03:33:38.523
MARISHA: Oh. Okay.

03:33:38.523 --> 03:33:42.150
MATT: All right. So, Veth?
LIAM: "Beg!"

03:33:42.150 --> 03:33:43.210
SAM: I'm going to swim.

03:33:43.210 --> 03:33:47.670
I can't get within range, so I will--

03:33:47.670 --> 03:33:49.290
Can I make it up to that thing

03:33:49.290 --> 03:33:50.810
that Fjord was behind before?

03:33:50.810 --> 03:33:53.833
MATT: Up here?
SAM: That rock that-- yeah.

03:33:53.833 --> 03:33:55.440
MATT: Right on top here, you mean?

03:33:55.440 --> 03:33:56.350
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

03:33:56.350 --> 03:33:57.991
Can I get behind that?

03:33:57.991 --> 03:33:59.800
MATT: You can get over here

03:33:59.800 --> 03:34:00.720
is about as far as you can get,

03:34:00.720 --> 03:34:03.607
which is partial cover.
SAM: Okay, that's fine.

03:34:03.607 --> 03:34:06.410
Can I hide behind something over there?

03:34:06.410 --> 03:34:07.280
MATT: Yeah, you can try and hide there.

03:34:07.280 --> 03:34:09.150
SAM: All right, I'll bonus action hide.

03:34:09.150 --> 03:34:11.170
MATT: All righty.

03:34:11.170 --> 03:34:12.460
SAM: And then I will--
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

03:34:12.460 --> 03:34:13.958
SAM: Oh, yeah, I have to stealth.

03:34:13.958 --> 03:34:16.120
Stealth, stealth...

03:34:19.220 --> 03:34:20.053
30.

03:34:20.053 --> 03:34:20.886
MATT: Okay.

03:34:21.750 --> 03:34:25.138
SAM: And then from my hidden position,

03:34:25.138 --> 03:34:27.420
I will cast a spell at it,

03:34:28.310 --> 03:34:30.830
using my Spell Sniper.

03:34:30.830 --> 03:34:33.760
Is that a thing? Not Spell Sniper.

03:34:33.760 --> 03:34:34.687
It's like--

03:34:36.280 --> 03:34:37.680
I've never done this before.

03:34:39.260 --> 03:34:40.580
Magical Ambush!

03:34:41.540 --> 03:34:43.310
If I'm hidden when I cast a spell,

03:34:43.310 --> 03:34:45.840
the creature has disadvantage on saving throw.

03:34:46.690 --> 03:34:48.890
TALIESIN: Ooh.
MATT: That's true.

03:34:48.890 --> 03:34:52.327
MARISHA: Wow. Wow, you haven't ever done that.

03:34:52.327 --> 03:34:53.470
MATT: Yeah.

03:34:53.470 --> 03:34:56.020
ASHLEY: Disadvantage on saving throws for the rest of the--

03:34:56.020 --> 03:34:58.110
SAM: No, just for this.
MATT: Just against that spell.

03:34:58.110 --> 03:35:03.110
SAM: So I will cast Phantasmal Force on It,
MATT: Okay.

03:35:03.376 --> 03:35:05.270
LAURA: Ooh, maybe he's extra-susceptible to it

03:35:05.270 --> 03:35:07.460
since all he does is communicate with mind images.

03:35:07.460 --> 03:35:08.510
TALIESIN: Could be.

03:35:09.350 --> 03:35:11.380
MATT: So what is the DC on that,
and what kind of save is it?

03:35:11.380 --> 03:35:12.720
Is it wisdom?
SAM: Only 15.

03:35:12.720 --> 03:35:14.950
MARISHA: Just flood the channels.

03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:18.190
SAM: And it is Intelligence.
MATT: Intelligence.

03:35:18.190 --> 03:35:19.357
Okay.

03:35:22.460 --> 03:35:25.350
Okay, so rolled an 18, and the lower number,

03:35:25.350 --> 03:35:27.330
with its bonus, is a 14.
LAURA: (gasps)

03:35:27.330 --> 03:35:28.780
SAM: So it failed.
MATT: It failed.

03:35:30.120 --> 03:35:32.350
So what's the effect?

03:35:32.350 --> 03:35:36.472
SAM: Well, not much, because I'm just a little creepy thing.

03:35:37.696 --> 03:35:41.771
So it will see a giant black portal,

03:35:41.771 --> 03:35:43.240
10 feet wide

03:35:43.240 --> 03:35:45.750
open up in front of it,

03:35:45.750 --> 03:35:49.140
accompanied by the sound of nightmarish howls

03:35:49.140 --> 03:35:51.653
from an Abyss-like plane,

03:35:51.653 --> 03:35:55.070
so it's like (warped growling)

03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:57.650
and it will hear, in Common, anyway,

03:35:57.650 --> 03:36:00.960
"I'm coming for you!"

03:36:00.960 --> 03:36:02.430
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

03:36:02.430 --> 03:36:06.870
MATT: All right. Okay. Does it take any damage from this?

03:36:06.870 --> 03:36:08.670
SAM: It could take--

03:36:08.670 --> 03:36:11.320
It can take psychic damage, maybe?

03:36:11.320 --> 03:36:13.040
MATT: I mean, does the spell do damage?

03:36:13.040 --> 03:36:15.190
SAM: Oh, yeah, but it seems to--

03:36:16.380 --> 03:36:19.970
It says if the effect seems like it would injure them,

03:36:19.970 --> 03:36:21.790
they can take a 1d6--
MATT: Right.

03:36:21.790 --> 03:36:23.950
So there's no damage yet.
SAM: No, it doesn't seem like it.

03:36:23.950 --> 03:36:25.580
MATT: Okay, you got it.

03:36:25.580 --> 03:36:27.100
Okay, that finishes your go.

03:36:27.100 --> 03:36:28.452
LIAM: You are <i>not</i> a little creepy thing--

03:36:28.452 --> 03:36:29.758
ASHLEY: That's cool.
LAURA: That was cool!

03:36:29.758 --> 03:36:31.742
LIAM: -- you are a strong halfling woman.
MATT: I will say...

03:36:33.670 --> 03:36:35.000
No, I mean, it failed the save,

03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:37.650
so it believes the scenario.

03:36:37.650 --> 03:36:40.490
So, you watch as it's on the ground,

03:36:40.490 --> 03:36:41.990
getting up from its groveling,

03:36:43.180 --> 03:36:44.770
in the process of getting up.

03:36:44.770 --> 03:36:46.880
It's angry, it's frustrated.

03:36:46.880 --> 03:36:49.120
It sees Yasha there, just grinning at that process,

03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:51.678
and now that it's moved away
from the one that's pinning it down

03:36:51.678 --> 03:36:53.240
and everyone's hiding over there,

03:36:53.240 --> 03:36:56.840
you see the weird tongue on the inside of the mouth

03:36:56.840 --> 03:36:59.313
comes out and licks the front
of its teeth looking at Yasha,

03:36:59.313 --> 03:37:02.670
and you can see the tongue itself
is glowing this extremely bright,

03:37:02.670 --> 03:37:07.240
almost like orange-ish yellow
hot poker iron type coloration

03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:08.340
as it pulls across the front.

03:37:08.340 --> 03:37:10.360
As it does, you can see bubbles rise

03:37:10.360 --> 03:37:11.738
as the water in its immediate vicinity

03:37:11.738 --> 03:37:16.510
flash vapors and bubbles up into the darkness above.

03:37:16.510 --> 03:37:19.170
Then suddenly it sees something

03:37:19.170 --> 03:37:20.980
out of the corner of its eyes.

03:37:20.980 --> 03:37:23.365
The eyes shoot there, and its entire body goes--

03:37:23.365 --> 03:37:25.500
(snarling)

03:37:25.500 --> 03:37:27.120
and you can see fear on its face.

03:37:27.120 --> 03:37:28.500
LAURA: Ooh!
SAM: Right, right.

03:37:29.953 --> 03:37:31.670
MATT: Does it get to save every round?

03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:33.094
SAM: I'll look.

03:37:33.094 --> 03:37:34.744
MARISHA: Wow. Okay.

03:37:37.710 --> 03:37:39.220
SAM: "While the target is affected by the spell..."

03:37:39.220 --> 03:37:40.053
Blah blah blah blah.

03:37:40.053 --> 03:37:42.005
MATT: You're concentrating on that.

03:37:42.005 --> 03:37:45.350
Oh, we have concentration here as well.

03:37:45.350 --> 03:37:47.460
Okay. You got that?

03:37:47.460 --> 03:37:49.890
Veth, that's your turn. Caduceus, you're up.

03:37:49.890 --> 03:37:50.990
Fjord, you're on deck.

03:37:51.870 --> 03:37:53.710
TALIESIN: How far forward would I have to walk

03:37:53.710 --> 03:37:56.580
to be within 30 feet of Yasha?

03:37:56.580 --> 03:38:00.163
MATT: To be within 30 feet of Yasha
from where you are, which is--

03:38:00.163 --> 03:38:01.859
TALIESIN: I'm invisible right there.
MATT: Right there?

03:38:01.859 --> 03:38:03.054
TALIESIN: Although I'd be visible now.

03:38:03.054 --> 03:38:05.870
MATT: You would be. Put it right there.

03:38:05.870 --> 03:38:07.940
You would need to go your full movement,

03:38:07.940 --> 03:38:09.707
or close to it. 10 feet.

03:38:12.940 --> 03:38:15.340
TALIESIN: Okay. I'll do--

03:38:15.340 --> 03:38:17.556
I'm going to try and get as centered as I am

03:38:17.556 --> 03:38:21.120
to get everyone-- as many people,
within a 30-foot radius, as possible.

03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:22.210
MATT: That'd be right there.

03:38:22.210 --> 03:38:24.727
TALIESIN: And do I get Beau in that?
MATT: Possibly.

03:38:27.075 --> 03:38:28.250
TALIESIN: (groaning)

03:38:28.250 --> 03:38:30.840
SAM: Matty, it says that it can use its action

03:38:30.840 --> 03:38:33.030
to investigate it.
MATT: Got it.

03:38:33.030 --> 03:38:33.863
LIAM: Ash.

03:38:33.863 --> 03:38:35.920
TALIESIN: Who's within range--?

03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:38.710
Just, I mean, it's one of those things where I'm...

03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:41.422
How many people do I think are in range?

03:38:41.422 --> 03:38:42.255
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:38:42.255 --> 03:38:44.410
MATT: You think everybody could possibly be in range,

03:38:44.410 --> 03:38:46.600
but you wouldn't know until you actually check.

03:38:46.600 --> 03:38:48.128
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to cast then at...

03:38:48.128 --> 03:38:51.540
LIAM: I'm just a Barbarian.
ASHLEY: With advantage.

03:38:51.540 --> 03:38:53.870
MARISHA: Poor Barbarians getting mind controlled.

03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:54.878
TALIESIN: Sorry, one second.

03:38:54.878 --> 03:38:57.602
LIAM: I mean, Grog got mind controlled all the time.
MARISHA: All the time, yeah.

03:38:57.602 --> 03:39:00.660
MATT: It's that low Wisdom, man.
MARISHA: It's true. (laughs)

03:39:00.660 --> 03:39:03.470
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LIAM: "Must kill my friends."

03:39:03.470 --> 03:39:04.755
MATT: What are you doing, Caduceus?

03:39:04.755 --> 03:39:07.890
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast this on six people.

03:39:07.890 --> 03:39:09.940
I'm casting Bless on six people.

03:39:09.940 --> 03:39:11.427
ASHLEY: Whoa.
MATT: Casting at what level?

03:39:11.427 --> 03:39:13.997
TALIESIN: That would be level four.
MATT: Okay.

03:39:16.808 --> 03:39:20.242
So, 30 feet, Beauregard is definitely in that way.

03:39:20.242 --> 03:39:21.633
Yasha's definitely in there.

03:39:21.633 --> 03:39:24.050
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was hoping to go one step diagonal

03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:26.000
or two step diagonal just to get a little closer to Beau

03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:31.000
and be not right behind phantom Jester.

03:39:31.430 --> 03:39:33.785
MATT: One step back, okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:39:33.785 --> 03:39:36.335
I mean one step, that diagonal.
MATT: There?

03:39:36.335 --> 03:39:38.654
TALIESIN: No, the other way. The other way. Yeah, there.

03:39:38.654 --> 03:39:39.487
MATT: Okay.

03:39:39.487 --> 03:39:41.920
So moving there, you get everybody except for Jester.

03:39:41.920 --> 03:39:44.530
TALIESIN: That's okay.
MATT: So, who are you choosing?

03:39:44.530 --> 03:39:46.620
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's six.

03:39:46.620 --> 03:39:51.436
So one, two, three, four,

03:39:51.436 --> 03:39:53.602
five, six.

03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:58.970
So, everyone has a d4 added to saves and attacks.

03:39:58.970 --> 03:40:00.330
ASHLEY: Yes.
MARISHA: Are we Blessed?

03:40:00.330 --> 03:40:01.590
TALIESIN: Yep.
ASHLEY: Thank you.

03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:03.700
SAM: Me too?
TALIESIN: Except Jester.

03:40:03.700 --> 03:40:07.327
LAURA: That's okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah. It was either you... yeah.

03:40:07.327 --> 03:40:08.160
MATT: And yourself?

03:40:08.160 --> 03:40:08.993
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:40:10.330 --> 03:40:12.723
LIAM: At least she's Jester though.
TALIESIN: That's true.

03:40:12.723 --> 03:40:15.130
TRAVIS: That's a d4 to Wisdom saving throws?
LAURA: I'm still smiling, even though I'm going to die.

03:40:15.130 --> 03:40:17.310
MATT: Every saving throw, every attack. Right?

03:40:17.310 --> 03:40:19.760
MARISHA: Attacks and saves.
TALIESIN: Attacks and saves have a d4.

03:40:19.760 --> 03:40:21.253
MATT: Everybody is Blessed. You got it.

03:40:21.253 --> 03:40:23.300
That finish your turn, Caduceus?

03:40:23.300 --> 03:40:24.910
TALIESIN: Yep, that's what I got.

03:40:24.910 --> 03:40:26.920
MATT: Fjord, you're up.
TALIESIN: Don't like where I am,

03:40:26.920 --> 03:40:28.630
but what am I going to do?
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:32.000
I'm going to float up from behind the platform,

03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:34.450
only so that my eyes crest the top

03:40:34.450 --> 03:40:36.340
so that I can see.
MATT: Okay.

03:40:36.340 --> 03:40:39.900
TRAVIS: And I am going to spot the portal

03:40:39.900 --> 03:40:42.300
that is being conjured by Nott.

03:40:42.300 --> 03:40:45.964
MATT: You don't see a portal.
You have no idea what's happening.

03:40:45.964 --> 03:40:48.014
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: It isn't an illusion to everybody.

03:40:48.014 --> 03:40:49.390
It's a vision that <i>he's</i> having.

03:40:49.390 --> 03:40:51.623
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: So you have no idea what Veth did.

03:40:51.623 --> 03:40:54.027
TRAVIS: Can I track where his eyes are cowering from?

03:40:55.370 --> 03:40:57.540
MATT: Make an Insight check.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:40:57.540 --> 03:40:59.891
ASHLEY: Come on.

03:41:01.374 --> 03:41:03.040
TRAVIS: (groaning) Not great.

03:41:04.049 --> 03:41:05.498
Six.
MATT: No, you have no idea.

03:41:05.498 --> 03:41:06.970
You don't even know he's afraid.

03:41:06.970 --> 03:41:08.778
As far as you know--
SAM: Damn it!

03:41:08.778 --> 03:41:10.857
MATT: -- it's just on the ground
groveling and getting up, so.

03:41:10.857 --> 03:41:13.680
LIAM: He could have pulled a barlgura through the illusion.

03:41:13.680 --> 03:41:15.460
MARISHA: That's so fucking cool.
SAM: That's what we had texted about,

03:41:15.460 --> 03:41:18.831
but I guess I never in-game told him what I was doing.

03:41:18.831 --> 03:41:20.360
(laughter)

03:41:20.360 --> 03:41:21.801
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:41:21.801 --> 03:41:22.868
It was what I said I was going to do

03:41:22.868 --> 03:41:24.652
before the fight, though.
SAM: It is.

03:41:27.510 --> 03:41:29.680
TALIESIN: Would you have done it anyway, is the question?

03:41:29.680 --> 03:41:32.214
SAM: Fjord, I made an illusion like we discussed!

03:41:32.214 --> 03:41:35.300
(laughter)

03:41:35.300 --> 03:41:38.218
Like we texted about a minute ago.

03:41:38.218 --> 03:41:40.720
LAURA: Here.
SAM: You can reply to this message.

03:41:42.170 --> 03:41:43.302
Okay. Uh--

03:41:44.602 --> 03:41:46.952
TALIESIN: I don't even know.
TRAVIS: I don't want to be all meta about it.

03:41:48.655 --> 03:41:49.891
MATT: What are you doing, Fjord?

03:41:49.891 --> 03:41:51.613
TRAVIS: (inhales sharply)
LIAM: Put him in prison. Meta prison.

03:41:51.613 --> 03:41:53.130
TALIESIN: I've been wondering why you haven't pulled anything out.

03:41:53.130 --> 03:41:54.080
LAURA: Yeah, you were going to do it.

03:41:54.080 --> 03:41:55.420
TRAVIS: Fuck it!
LAURA: Just do it.

03:41:55.420 --> 03:41:57.678
You just won't know where to do it from.

03:41:57.678 --> 03:42:00.300
MARISHA: That's true.
TRAVIS: In this area,

03:42:01.370 --> 03:42:03.200
because it's the biggest open space,

03:42:04.720 --> 03:42:08.400
I'm going to use Major Image, and I'm going to conjure

03:42:08.400 --> 03:42:13.400
a 20-foot by 20-foot Astral dreadnought.

03:42:13.620 --> 03:42:16.690
MARISHA: Yes!
TRAVIS: That looks like it's burning

03:42:16.690 --> 03:42:18.758
with the same sort of glowing fire

03:42:18.758 --> 03:42:20.550
that Vokodo has.

03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:22.460
MATT: Whereabouts?

03:42:22.460 --> 03:42:23.750
TRAVIS: Yeah, kind of over...

03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:25.183
Yeah, right about there.

03:42:27.258 --> 03:42:28.091
MATT: Okay.

03:42:28.091 --> 03:42:31.380
TRAVIS: Maybe a little closer to where I actually am.

03:42:31.380 --> 03:42:34.260
Just so that it pushes him back towards you

03:42:34.260 --> 03:42:35.700
and away from most of us.

03:42:35.700 --> 03:42:37.040
MATT: So, about there?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:42:37.040 --> 03:42:37.873
MATT: Okay.

03:42:40.931 --> 03:42:42.810
Major Image, there we go.

03:42:42.810 --> 03:42:45.768
TRAVIS: 120 feet range, 20 by 20 cube.

03:42:45.768 --> 03:42:49.650
It makes sounds, looks terrifying...

03:42:51.860 --> 03:42:53.226
MATT: Totally.

03:42:53.226 --> 03:42:55.292
LIAM: How-- for comparison,

03:42:55.292 --> 03:42:57.790
how big was the astral dreadnought

03:42:57.790 --> 03:43:00.480
that we went into the mouth of?

03:43:00.480 --> 03:43:01.831
MATT: The astral dreadnought that you went in the mouth of?

03:43:01.831 --> 03:43:02.664
LIAM: Yeah.

03:43:02.664 --> 03:43:05.620
MATT: Was between 20 and 25 feet wide on any side.

03:43:05.620 --> 03:43:06.453
LIAM: Okay, great.
LAURA: Okay.

03:43:06.453 --> 03:43:09.000
MATT: So, much larger than him.
SAM: It's a juvenile.

03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:11.092
TRAVIS: He's a runt.
MATT: Or a little bit larger than him.

03:43:11.092 --> 03:43:13.600
MARISHA: Or, once again, just very far away.

03:43:13.600 --> 03:43:14.654
SAM: That's right.
LIAM: Right.

03:43:14.654 --> 03:43:15.860
SAM: (laughs)
MATT: Okay.

03:43:15.860 --> 03:43:19.030
SAM: Water distorts...
MATT: You create that illusion.

03:43:19.030 --> 03:43:20.820
MARISHA: The heat...
MATT: It's resting there.

03:43:21.740 --> 03:43:23.870
Is that your turn?
TRAVIS: Yeah, and it lets out

03:43:23.870 --> 03:43:27.570
a terrifying astral dreadnought bellow.

03:43:27.570 --> 03:43:29.300
MATT: Which you've never heard.
TRAVIS: I've never heard.

03:43:29.300 --> 03:43:30.770
MATT: So, what's it sound like?

03:43:30.770 --> 03:43:33.555
TRAVIS: (inhales sharply)
Just a cacophony of shit.

03:43:33.555 --> 03:43:35.215
(laughter)

03:43:35.215 --> 03:43:38.591
Just diarrhea-inducing sounds.

03:43:38.591 --> 03:43:40.324
LIAM: ♪ MMMBop ♪

03:43:40.324 --> 03:43:42.507
ALL: (singing "MMMBop")
TRAVIS: (screeching)

03:43:42.507 --> 03:43:45.005
MATT: That induces diarrhea.
(laughter)

03:43:45.005 --> 03:43:47.570
TRAVIS: Yeah, just a thousand t-rexes

03:43:47.570 --> 03:43:49.210
pitched down a couple decibels.

03:43:49.210 --> 03:43:50.680
MATT: You got it, okay.
LAURA: Ooh, that's nice.

03:43:50.680 --> 03:43:52.750
MATT: All of you guys see this too, by the way.

03:43:53.760 --> 03:43:56.910
Suddenly, this smaller than usual astral dreadnought

03:43:56.910 --> 03:43:59.920
just emerges out of the shadows on the side

03:43:59.920 --> 03:44:01.460
and begins roaring.

03:44:03.570 --> 03:44:05.420
So, keep that in mind for whatever role playing purposes

03:44:05.420 --> 03:44:06.324
there might be.

03:44:06.324 --> 03:44:08.120
LAURA: But said he was going to do it.

03:44:08.120 --> 03:44:09.910
So it shouldn't be completely...

03:44:09.910 --> 03:44:12.380
MARISHA: We did have the talk.
TRAVIS: It's still pretty intense.

03:44:12.380 --> 03:44:14.522
MATT: It's still intense. Just be aware.

03:44:14.522 --> 03:44:16.563
That's still a big thing.
LIAM: (pigeon coos)

03:44:16.563 --> 03:44:19.088
MATT: Okay, that finishes Fjord's go.
Top of the round. Beauregard, you're up.

03:44:19.088 --> 03:44:20.040
MARISHA: (startling)

03:44:20.040 --> 03:44:21.140
MATT: Caleb, you're on deck.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:44:21.140 --> 03:44:22.970
MARISHA: Shit, ugh. Okay.

03:44:22.970 --> 03:44:25.470
I'm 30 feet away from it?

03:44:25.470 --> 03:44:27.820
MATT: You are right now, yeah, 30 feet.

03:44:27.820 --> 03:44:29.461
MARISHA: Not no mores.

03:44:29.461 --> 03:44:31.430
MATT: (laughs)
SAM: Doggy paddle!

03:44:31.430 --> 03:44:33.450
MARISHA: Doggy paddle.
MATT: Move forward.

03:44:33.450 --> 03:44:38.105
MARISHA: I'm going to do a swan dive, going to go down,

03:44:39.377 --> 03:44:41.530
going to punch him in the face.
(laughter)

03:44:41.530 --> 03:44:42.530
MATT: Okay.

03:44:42.530 --> 03:44:45.027
LIAM: I cast Punch Him in the Face.

03:44:45.027 --> 03:44:47.425
MARISHA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

03:44:47.425 --> 03:44:49.460
MARISHA: I'm super flowery about punching.

03:44:49.460 --> 03:44:51.840
LAURA: What about your lightning gloves?

03:44:52.740 --> 03:44:54.340
MARISHA: It takes an action. Right?

03:44:54.340 --> 03:44:56.490
Does it take an action?

03:44:56.490 --> 03:44:58.140
LAURA: I thought it was a free action.

03:44:59.460 --> 03:45:02.638
MARISHA: (mumbling, reading)

03:45:02.638 --> 03:45:05.720
LIAM: (drumming fingers)

03:45:05.720 --> 03:45:08.690
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess it doesn't take an action, does it?

03:45:08.690 --> 03:45:10.330
So I can just do it.

03:45:10.330 --> 03:45:11.850
LAURA: It's not taken an action before.

03:45:11.850 --> 03:45:14.080
MARISHA: It doesn't specify that it takes an action.

03:45:14.080 --> 03:45:15.713
MATT: Then it's a fault on my end.

03:45:21.165 --> 03:45:22.280
If it hasn't previously, we'll let it go

03:45:22.280 --> 03:45:23.360
for the purposes of this battle,

03:45:23.360 --> 03:45:25.851
but I should've said that.
MARISHA: (imitating lightning)

03:45:25.851 --> 03:45:27.840
MATT: Okay. Fists go.
MARISHA: Thanks for the reminder.

03:45:27.840 --> 03:45:29.527
Would've been a waste of a turn.

03:45:29.527 --> 03:45:32.000
MATT: I'll probably make it a bonus action going forward.

03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:34.510
MARISHA: Okay. Oh, wait, I rolled!

03:45:34.510 --> 03:45:35.420
Oh, no, I rolled,

03:45:35.420 --> 03:45:37.570
and I just picked up the dice that I rolled!

03:45:37.570 --> 03:45:40.562
I'm rolling again.
TALIESIN: And you get a d4.

03:45:40.562 --> 03:45:42.610
MARISHA: And I have a d4!

03:45:42.610 --> 03:45:45.289
Oh, the other rolls I did were way better.

03:45:45.289 --> 03:45:47.270
(laughter)
MATT: You have advantage,

03:45:47.270 --> 03:45:50.212
by the way, because he is prone.

03:45:50.212 --> 03:45:52.504
MARISHA: Shh! Okay.
MATT: He hasn't had his turn yet.

03:45:54.200 --> 03:45:55.120
MARISHA: Well, then,

03:45:55.120 --> 03:45:57.530
I will take that seven with that plus four,

03:45:57.530 --> 03:46:00.330
thanks Caduceus, to make it 21 total.

03:46:00.330 --> 03:46:02.840
TRAVIS: He's fucking prone.
LAURA: He's what?

03:46:02.840 --> 03:46:05.315
TRAVIS: Forgot he's prone.
MARISHA: 21, hits.

03:46:06.699 --> 03:46:08.073
Yeah?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:46:10.219 --> 03:46:11.435
SAM and ASHLEY: What does that mean?

03:46:11.435 --> 03:46:13.530
LAURA: Melee attacks get advantage.
TRAVIS: Advantage on melee.

03:46:14.772 --> 03:46:16.347
Double the chances for a nat.

03:46:17.320 --> 03:46:19.080
ASHLEY: It's fine, I got this over here.

03:46:19.080 --> 03:46:20.728
I'm just hacking away at him over here.

03:46:20.728 --> 03:46:23.470
(laughter)
MARISHA: 10 damage.

03:46:23.470 --> 03:46:25.410
TALIESIN: Just charging up over time.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

03:46:25.410 --> 03:46:27.601
ASHLEY: Just waiting for my moment!

03:46:27.601 --> 03:46:28.984
MATT: That is a 22.

03:46:30.465 --> 03:46:31.820
MARISHA: He definitely saves from that.

03:46:31.820 --> 03:46:34.402
MATT: Second attack?
MARISHA: Second attack.

03:46:34.402 --> 03:46:36.402
With the d4.

03:46:38.177 --> 03:46:39.110
23?

03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:40.597
MATT: 23 hits.

03:46:41.530 --> 03:46:45.040
MARISHA: Uh-huh, 11 damage.
MATT: 11 points of damage.

03:46:45.040 --> 03:46:47.515
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.
MATT: Stunning Strike again.

03:46:47.515 --> 03:46:50.023
MARISHA: Burning through all my ki points.
MATT: So, that is going to be...

03:46:51.890 --> 03:46:53.448
16?

03:46:53.448 --> 03:46:54.773
MARISHA: My save is 16.

03:46:54.773 --> 03:46:55.956
MATT: Saves.

03:46:58.664 --> 03:46:59.847
MARISHA: Pop pop?

03:46:59.847 --> 03:47:01.930
MATT: All right. Another Flurry of Blows? Go for it.

03:47:01.930 --> 03:47:04.505
MARISHA: Yikes. God, I'm getting really low.

03:47:05.655 --> 03:47:07.321
SAM: Low on punches?

03:47:07.321 --> 03:47:08.300
MARISHA: Kis.
SAM: Oh.

03:47:08.300 --> 03:47:09.133
MARISHA: Points.

03:47:09.133 --> 03:47:11.610
SAM: Do you only have a certain
number of punches every day?

03:47:11.610 --> 03:47:13.571
MARISHA: I do, I have to ration out my punches.

03:47:13.571 --> 03:47:15.340
(laughter)

03:47:15.340 --> 03:47:20.048
MARISHA: Those were both 16s, so 26 total.

03:47:20.048 --> 03:47:21.400
Plus the d4, so...

03:47:21.400 --> 03:47:23.070
MATT: You rolling with advantage on each of those too?

03:47:23.070 --> 03:47:24.670
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Yep. Those all hit.

03:47:24.670 --> 03:47:27.950
MARISHA: 26 is technically 30 total.
MATT: You got it.

03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:29.430
TRAVIS: Nice.

03:47:29.430 --> 03:47:31.148
SAM: It's looking pretty rough, right?

03:47:31.148 --> 03:47:33.072
(laughter)
ASHLEY: How de doody do this?

03:47:33.072 --> 03:47:35.822
(laughter)

03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:40.480
MARISHA: 14 damage, and for the second one...

03:47:40.480 --> 03:47:42.910
Sorry, it's a lot of dice.

03:47:42.910 --> 03:47:47.910
TALIESIN: Kill him.
MARISHA: 23. 25 total to hit.

03:47:48.212 --> 03:47:51.420
It's another eight for another 14 points of damage.

03:47:51.420 --> 03:47:53.500
MATT: Great, all right.

03:47:53.500 --> 03:47:56.470
As those blows are jamming into its side,

03:47:56.470 --> 03:47:57.303
you are just angrily...

03:47:57.303 --> 03:47:58.960
And you're hitting, you're doing some serious damage.

03:47:58.960 --> 03:48:00.110
You can see areas

03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:03.160
where the blackened rock exterior is cracking

03:48:03.160 --> 03:48:06.140
and some of the molten glow is getting brighter

03:48:06.140 --> 03:48:07.680
as you're actually damaging it

03:48:07.680 --> 03:48:09.710
and seeing it breaking away.

03:48:09.710 --> 03:48:12.660
You do suffer, ooh.
TALIESIN: Even though...?

03:48:12.660 --> 03:48:13.580
Oh, yeah, you are making contact.

03:48:13.580 --> 03:48:15.496
MATT: 22 points of fire damage.

03:48:15.496 --> 03:48:17.020
MARISHA: I'm starting to punch lava.

03:48:17.020 --> 03:48:18.570
It's starting to hurt real bad.

03:48:18.570 --> 03:48:20.570
MATT: So take your 22 points of fire damage.

03:48:21.930 --> 03:48:24.850
MARISHA: Beau's looking not gr--
she's looking a little charred,

03:48:24.850 --> 03:48:26.640
a little blistered in a lot of places.

03:48:26.640 --> 03:48:29.988
Definitely some third-degree burns in some areas.

03:48:29.988 --> 03:48:32.280
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

03:48:32.280 --> 03:48:35.420
LIAM: Caleb will swim around that column a bit

03:48:35.420 --> 03:48:37.820
to try to get as close as possible,

03:48:37.820 --> 03:48:40.680
and start weaving his hands in the water,

03:48:40.680 --> 03:48:43.410
and muttering arcane words and say,

03:48:43.410 --> 03:48:45.528
I have an offering for you!

03:48:45.528 --> 03:48:46.890
And I will pull out my middle finger and say

03:48:46.890 --> 03:48:49.770
you make a shitty god, you bedazzled cephalopod!

03:48:49.770 --> 03:48:51.010
And I will cast Banishment.

03:48:51.010 --> 03:48:52.280
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!
SAM: Yes!

03:48:52.280 --> 03:48:53.322
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Bravo!

03:48:53.322 --> 03:48:54.690
SAM: Do this.
MARISHA: Come on.

03:48:54.690 --> 03:48:56.540
ASHLEY: Let's go.
MATT: What save is that?

03:48:56.540 --> 03:48:58.592
LIAM: Charisma.
MATT: Charisma.

03:48:59.870 --> 03:49:02.100
MATT: 17.
LIAM: 17!

03:49:02.100 --> 03:49:04.783
MATT: It's not his best save, but I rolled high on that.

03:49:04.783 --> 03:49:06.660
LIAM: You rolled high. Fuck!

03:49:06.660 --> 03:49:10.350
MATT: Beauregard, make a Charisma saving throw, plus a d4.

03:49:10.350 --> 03:49:13.618
SAM: Oh, no!
LIAM: See you in hell, Beauregard.

03:49:13.618 --> 03:49:15.730
MARISHA: (laughs) Fuck you, Caleb.

03:49:15.730 --> 03:49:17.513
Fuck you!
SAM: Oh, no!

03:49:18.580 --> 03:49:20.550
ASHLEY: Wait, do I have to
because I'm in the vicinity?

03:49:20.550 --> 03:49:23.610
LIAM: No. He chooses.
MARISHA: He chooses?

03:49:23.610 --> 03:49:25.760
ASHLEY: He chooses.
TALIESIN: Did you add your d4?

03:49:25.760 --> 03:49:28.220
MARISHA: I'm about to.

03:49:28.220 --> 03:49:30.544
Mmkay.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

03:49:30.544 --> 03:49:33.710
MARISHA: Mm-mmm.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:49:33.710 --> 03:49:35.700
TRAVIS: Say it!
MARISHA: 14.

03:49:35.700 --> 03:49:38.893
MATT: Where were you--? Okay, so--
LIAM: To his home turf.

03:49:38.893 --> 03:49:39.968
MARISHA: (yelling)

03:49:39.968 --> 03:49:43.847
MATT: Beauregard vanishes from the battlefield

03:49:43.847 --> 03:49:46.410
in a flash of arcane power.

03:49:46.410 --> 03:49:49.280
Beauregard, as you're right there, fists burning,

03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:50.820
you get this weird sensation,

03:49:50.820 --> 03:49:53.320
like this weird sparkling around your torso,

03:49:53.320 --> 03:49:55.310
and then suddenly darkness,

03:49:56.200 --> 03:49:58.710
and you are adrift on this endless sea

03:49:58.710 --> 03:50:00.740
of sparkling gossamer.
MARISHA: (incredulous laughing)

03:50:00.740 --> 03:50:04.960
MATT: Stars and silver. All your friends are gone.

03:50:04.960 --> 03:50:06.877
The water's gone.
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

03:50:06.877 --> 03:50:09.970
MATT: You are just floating.
SAM: Can she breathe?

03:50:09.970 --> 03:50:11.844
MATT: Yeah, you can breathe.
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:50:11.844 --> 03:50:13.544
LIAM: Sure, it's--
TRAVIS: Well, that's convenient.

03:50:13.544 --> 03:50:15.940
MATT: And as you go to inhale-- (coughs)

03:50:15.940 --> 03:50:19.130
you cough all the water out of your lungs,

03:50:19.130 --> 03:50:21.030
and you are alone.
(laughter)

03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:23.450
It is cold and you are alone.

03:50:23.450 --> 03:50:24.870
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.
LAURA: Is it dark?

03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:28.530
MATT: It's dark beyond bits of weird silver scapes

03:50:28.530 --> 03:50:31.530
of cloud and sparkles from all around.

03:50:31.530 --> 03:50:32.970
You see distant little clusters

03:50:32.970 --> 03:50:35.470
of looks like floating rocks, slowly rotating.

03:50:35.470 --> 03:50:36.680
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool.

03:50:36.680 --> 03:50:37.960
MATT: All right
MARISHA: Am I dead?

03:50:39.130 --> 03:50:40.010
MATT: Maybe.

03:50:40.010 --> 03:50:42.697
LIAM: Question for the DM.
MATT: Yes.

03:50:42.697 --> 03:50:44.450
LIAM: I remember-- I'm not using luck.

03:50:44.450 --> 03:50:46.340
I have Fortune's Favor.

03:50:46.340 --> 03:50:50.320
Luck used to be, you could make a target re-roll as well.

03:50:50.320 --> 03:50:51.540
Does that apply here?
MATT: No.

03:50:51.540 --> 03:50:52.940
Fortune's Favor is about your fortune.

03:50:52.940 --> 03:50:54.891
Not somebody else's.
LIAM: Got it.

03:50:54.891 --> 03:50:56.986
TALIESIN: Fuck.
LIAM: All right, done. Byeee!

03:50:56.986 --> 03:50:58.260
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:50:58.260 --> 03:51:00.720
TRAVIS: Wild.
TALIESIN: It could get worse.

03:51:00.720 --> 03:51:03.120
MATT: Lair actions now.
SAM: Lair actions.

03:51:03.120 --> 03:51:05.320
MATT: The creature, now getting back up into its space.

03:51:05.320 --> 03:51:06.475
LIAM: Don't worry, Beau, you're safe.

03:51:06.475 --> 03:51:10.050
MATT: Freaked out by what's over in that area.

03:51:10.050 --> 03:51:12.260
It's going to go ahead and--
TRAVIS: You mean the giant portal

03:51:12.260 --> 03:51:14.500
or the giant mini dreadnought?

03:51:14.500 --> 03:51:15.350
MATT: Both.
LAURA: (laughs)

03:51:15.350 --> 03:51:17.550
MATT: But this is the lair action.

03:51:17.550 --> 03:51:20.250
In this space, it is going to...

03:51:20.250 --> 03:51:23.080
It wastes its lair action on your illusion.

03:51:23.080 --> 03:51:23.913
SAM: Yes!

03:51:23.913 --> 03:51:25.200
MATT: And the direction of your illusion and your illusion.

03:51:25.200 --> 03:51:27.494
SAM: Yes!
MATT: So nobody is hypnotized--

03:51:27.494 --> 03:51:29.656
TRAVIS: Hey!
LAURA: Hey!

03:51:29.656 --> 03:51:31.587
TRAVIS: That's something! Oh, thank god.

03:51:33.350 --> 03:51:35.130
ASHLEY: Wait, I was in that, but I'm already hypnotized.

03:51:35.130 --> 03:51:37.010
MATT: You're already hypnotized.
ASHLEY: I can't be doubly hypnotized.

03:51:37.010 --> 03:51:40.010
SAM: Does it discern anything
about the illusions or anything?

03:51:40.010 --> 03:51:41.650
MATT: It hasn't taken its turn yet.
That was its lair action.

03:51:41.650 --> 03:51:43.980
SAM: Got it.
TRAVIS: Think it has to touch it.

03:51:43.980 --> 03:51:45.880
MATT: Now it is Vilya's turn.

03:51:45.880 --> 03:51:48.310
Vilya's going to go ahead and swim,

03:51:48.310 --> 03:51:51.637
over as this orca, over here to get a visual.

03:51:51.637 --> 03:51:54.113
LAURA: Ooh, she almost knocked me over!
TRAVIS: I know.

03:51:54.113 --> 03:51:55.580
MATT: And is going to-- (impact)

03:51:55.580 --> 03:51:57.700
bring the bolt down onto Vokodo.

03:51:57.700 --> 03:52:00.600
LAURA: I like to picture the killer whale's little fin.

03:52:02.383 --> 03:52:03.610
SAM: (laughs)

03:52:03.610 --> 03:52:05.975
MATT: However, it does succeed on the save.

03:52:07.733 --> 03:52:10.924
LIAM: (imitating killer whale)

03:52:13.270 --> 03:52:15.591
And completely misses <i>it</i>--

03:52:15.591 --> 03:52:16.824
LAURA: (gasps)

03:52:16.824 --> 03:52:19.380
MATT: -- as the bolt fires down instead,

03:52:19.380 --> 03:52:21.700
and strikes Fjord.

03:52:21.700 --> 03:52:23.490
I need you to make a Dexterity saving throw.

03:52:23.490 --> 03:52:26.460
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
LAURA: Oh, no, she rolled a one?

03:52:26.460 --> 03:52:28.140
How did that miss it?

03:52:28.140 --> 03:52:30.921
MATT: He made his saving throw.
SAM: Thanks, Keyleth's mom.

03:52:30.921 --> 03:52:33.388
(laughter)

03:52:33.388 --> 03:52:35.255
MARISHA: I was waiting for it, yeah!

03:52:35.255 --> 03:52:39.608
(laughter)

03:52:39.608 --> 03:52:42.580
MARISHA: Apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
SAM: Way to go, Keyleth's mom.

03:52:42.580 --> 03:52:45.381
TRAVIS: 17.
LIAM: Oh, man. A joke five years in the making.

03:52:45.381 --> 03:52:46.214
(laughter)

03:52:46.214 --> 03:52:47.960
TRAVIS: That's-- d4 for Bless, right?

03:52:47.960 --> 03:52:50.510
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: That's exactly her spell DC,

03:52:50.510 --> 03:52:52.140
so you take half damage.

03:52:52.140 --> 03:52:54.957
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 5d10, half of that?

03:52:54.957 --> 03:52:57.177
TALIESIN: Do they both take half damage, or no?

03:52:57.177 --> 03:52:58.241
MATT: He does not.

03:52:58.241 --> 03:53:00.470
LIAM: ♪ Keyleth's mom don't got it going on ♪

03:53:00.470 --> 03:53:01.900
LAURA: He doesn't take any damage from it?

03:53:01.900 --> 03:53:03.900
MATT: Not if he makes the save on something for half.

03:53:03.900 --> 03:53:05.100
TALIESIN: Fuck.

03:53:06.808 --> 03:53:07.971
MATT: All right.

03:53:09.221 --> 03:53:10.587
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:53:12.020 --> 03:53:14.729
MATT: 28 points of lightning damage, reduced to 14.

03:53:14.729 --> 03:53:16.420
You take 14 points of lightning damage, Fjord.

03:53:16.420 --> 03:53:17.860
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: And if I recall...

03:53:17.860 --> 03:53:19.758
TRAVIS: That's serious.

03:53:19.758 --> 03:53:22.925
(intense, dark music)

03:53:24.758 --> 03:53:25.591
MATT: Let's see.

03:53:25.591 --> 03:53:27.400
Each creature within five feet of that point.

03:53:27.400 --> 03:53:29.720
So, I need both Veth and Jester

03:53:29.720 --> 03:53:31.310
to also make Dexterity saving throws.

03:53:31.310 --> 03:53:32.710
LAURA: Motherfuck.
SAM: Wait, what?

03:53:34.080 --> 03:53:35.570
TRAVIS: It's electrifying!

03:53:35.570 --> 03:53:39.000
SAM: I'm so far away from it.
LIAM: We can't let this NPC die.

03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:40.190
LAURA: Oh, no, we're next to Fjord though.

03:53:40.190 --> 03:53:41.800
MATT: You guys are both within five feet of Fjord,

03:53:41.800 --> 03:53:43.530
and it struck Fjord.
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

03:53:43.530 --> 03:53:46.010
LIAM: We have to get her to--
TRAVIS: Home?

03:53:46.010 --> 03:53:47.293
LIAM: -- Zephrah.
LAURA: 11.

03:53:47.293 --> 03:53:48.980
LIAM: We have to.
SAM: 23.

03:53:48.980 --> 03:53:49.813
LIAM: Must.
MATT: You succeed and take

03:53:49.813 --> 03:53:51.732
no damage because of your Evasion ability.

03:53:51.732 --> 03:53:53.482
SAM: That's right.
MATT: You take the full brunt of it.

03:53:53.482 --> 03:53:54.350
Wait, how much did you take again?

03:53:54.350 --> 03:53:55.330
You took...
TRAVIS: I took 14.

03:53:55.330 --> 03:53:57.350
MATT: 14. 28 points lightning damage to you, Jester.

03:53:57.350 --> 03:54:00.325
SAM: (groans) Jester!
TRAVIS: Wow. It did more to her than me.

03:54:00.325 --> 03:54:01.166
SAM: Wow!

03:54:01.166 --> 03:54:03.297
MATT: Vilya, at this point, the orca goes--

03:54:04.617 --> 03:54:06.007
(orca wailing)

03:54:06.007 --> 03:54:08.970
and gives this baleful sorry sound

03:54:08.970 --> 03:54:11.630
throughout the water that all of you hear.

03:54:11.630 --> 03:54:13.450
SAM: Sorry.
LAURA: 28 points?

03:54:13.450 --> 03:54:15.303
MATT: 28 points.
LAURA: Okay.

03:54:17.420 --> 03:54:20.750
MATT: Okay, that finishes her go. It is now Vokodo's turn.

03:54:20.750 --> 03:54:25.500
Vokodo is extremely scared of this thing.

03:54:25.500 --> 03:54:27.568
It's going to use its action to try--

03:54:28.453 --> 03:54:30.690
It's going to try and move away from the illusion.

03:54:30.690 --> 03:54:32.200
It's going to use its action to try and discern

03:54:32.200 --> 03:54:33.830
whatever it is you're opening there.

03:54:33.830 --> 03:54:35.351
SAM: It's another Intelligence check.

03:54:35.351 --> 03:54:38.430
MATT: Weirdly, it seems more scared of what you're doing

03:54:38.430 --> 03:54:40.090
than what you created.

03:54:40.090 --> 03:54:42.899
So what is it?
SAM: You did good. Intelligence 15.

03:54:42.899 --> 03:54:45.480
MATT: Intelligence 15.

03:54:45.480 --> 03:54:47.680
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that succeeds.

03:54:49.553 --> 03:54:51.930
SAM: It's a battle of minds.
MATT: It is.

03:54:51.930 --> 03:54:53.150
As it looks towards it,

03:54:53.150 --> 03:54:55.450
you can see it's about to flee from that,

03:54:55.450 --> 03:54:59.600
and then the eyes look over in your direction,

03:54:59.600 --> 03:55:00.433
as you've exposed yourself,

03:55:00.433 --> 03:55:02.660
still after casting the spell behind the side,

03:55:02.660 --> 03:55:04.840
after you're fried by the lightning.

03:55:04.840 --> 03:55:07.280
Or actually, no, you managed to dodge it
and put yourself out in the open,

03:55:07.280 --> 03:55:09.110
and it sees you, and you're like, "Ah, shit!"

03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:10.660
However, its eyes still looking at the illusion

03:55:10.660 --> 03:55:12.500
that you've created, too. It's like...

03:55:12.500 --> 03:55:15.440
And it's going to attempt to move back with its movement.

03:55:15.440 --> 03:55:20.440
SAM: So now that it's discerned, my thing's dead, yeah?

03:55:20.450 --> 03:55:23.200
MATT: Actually, make a concentration check for me.

03:55:23.200 --> 03:55:24.600
This might change things,

03:55:24.600 --> 03:55:26.700
because you're holding the spell.

03:55:26.700 --> 03:55:29.730
SAM: I was, but I think once he discerns that it's false...

03:55:29.730 --> 03:55:32.010
MATT: Right, but if you fail your concentration check,

03:55:32.010 --> 03:55:33.930
the spell would have faded
before it came to his turn, so.

03:55:33.930 --> 03:55:34.960
SAM: Oh, got it.

03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:36.920
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

03:55:36.920 --> 03:55:38.250
SAM: But I didn't get hit.
MATT: That's true.

03:55:38.250 --> 03:55:40.260
You took no damage. So, no.
This works out fine.

03:55:40.260 --> 03:55:41.093
You're right, you're right.

03:55:41.093 --> 03:55:42.741
So, pulling back, he's going to go ahead

03:55:42.741 --> 03:55:47.507
and swim backward 50 feet.

03:55:47.507 --> 03:55:48.340
TRAVIS: Five zero?

03:55:48.340 --> 03:55:50.730
MATT: Yes. That'll put him back about there.

03:55:50.730 --> 03:55:52.040
LIAM: Jeez.

03:55:52.040 --> 03:55:56.078
SAM: Take your attack of opportunity, Yasha.

03:55:57.261 --> 03:55:58.566
LIAM: Nope.
MATT: (sighs)

03:55:58.566 --> 03:56:00.550
(laughter)

03:56:00.550 --> 03:56:02.258
MATT: That wasted his action.

03:56:02.258 --> 03:56:03.349
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.
SAM: That's great.

03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:05.480
MATT: So now as you watch, he's like--

03:56:05.480 --> 03:56:08.750
octopus swimming backward as small coins and baubles

03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:10.120
are falling off of its body,

03:56:10.120 --> 03:56:14.100
its eyes wildly staring at the large astral dreadnought

03:56:14.100 --> 03:56:15.600
that's sitting there in front.

03:56:16.500 --> 03:56:19.330
So, your guys' teamwork fucked up his round.

03:56:19.330 --> 03:56:22.080
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: That's going to finish his go.

03:56:22.080 --> 03:56:25.440
Oh, and everybody at the top of his turn, sorry--

03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:26.648
SAM: Takes...

03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:30.340
MATT: Takes four points of fire damage.

03:56:30.340 --> 03:56:33.100
LAURA: Except for you, Beau!
MARISHA: I'm so lucky.

03:56:33.100 --> 03:56:34.490
LIAM: Is that from the water heating up?

03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:36.315
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Yeah. Four points.

03:56:36.315 --> 03:56:38.265
SAM: That's nothing!
LIAM: I can't wait for Beau's turn.

03:56:38.265 --> 03:56:41.270
TRAVIS: No boiling water in the middle of fucking nowhere!

03:56:41.270 --> 03:56:44.885
MATT: Yasha, it's your turn.
MARISHA: Water can't boil in space!

03:56:44.885 --> 03:56:47.990
MATT: So you move--
TALIESIN: Advantage with the d4.

03:56:48.970 --> 03:56:52.215
MATT: You move 20 more feet, because you can.

03:56:53.285 --> 03:56:56.380
That puts you right about there.

03:56:56.380 --> 03:56:58.030
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Staring towards him.

03:56:58.030 --> 03:56:59.430
And you dash to get up there as well,

03:56:59.430 --> 03:57:01.380
so you are right up in his face.

03:57:01.380 --> 03:57:03.220
ASHLEY: Can you use the d4 for--
TALIESIN: Yeah, every time.

03:57:03.220 --> 03:57:04.960
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay.

03:57:07.610 --> 03:57:11.585
(sighs) 19.
MATT: 19 succeeds.

03:57:11.585 --> 03:57:12.649
ASHLEY: Yeah!

03:57:12.649 --> 03:57:13.482
So at the end of your turn,

03:57:13.482 --> 03:57:15.130
as you rush up again, still staring at it,

03:57:15.130 --> 03:57:18.110
suddenly as you see its eyes distracted by this creature,

03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:20.675
the astral dreadnought screams,
and you shake your head,

03:57:20.675 --> 03:57:23.725
the roar of the illusion piercing
through your head for a second.

03:57:23.725 --> 03:57:26.457
You look and see it
and for a moment, your heart drops.

03:57:26.457 --> 03:57:28.061
(gasps)

03:57:28.061 --> 03:57:30.200
Fjord had mentioned this earlier,

03:57:30.200 --> 03:57:32.860
and you feel, for a moment, foolish for the fact

03:57:32.860 --> 03:57:36.350
that you've been caught in this hypnosis by this creature.

03:57:36.350 --> 03:57:38.200
But that foolishness fades

03:57:38.200 --> 03:57:41.980
and goes immediate into this deep, deep anger.

03:57:41.980 --> 03:57:43.940
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: So that ends your turn.

03:57:43.940 --> 03:57:46.100
TRAVIS: Let's go. Let's go!
MATT: Jester, you're up,

03:57:46.100 --> 03:57:48.250
and Veth, you're on deck.
TRAVIS: Let's go!

03:57:48.250 --> 03:57:52.040
ASHLEY: Right in front of his mouth. I'm like-- oh.

03:57:52.040 --> 03:57:54.988
Wait, so I can't move from there, right?

03:57:54.988 --> 03:57:56.070
MATT: Correct, that's the end of your turn.

03:57:56.070 --> 03:57:59.730
ASHLEY: Got it, got it, got it. Okay.

03:57:59.730 --> 03:58:01.390
TRAVIS: Have some dental work.
ASHLEY: That's okay, that's okay.

03:58:01.390 --> 03:58:02.223
Thank you for that.

03:58:02.223 --> 03:58:04.820
LAURA: I'm going to take a cue from Caleb--

03:58:04.820 --> 03:58:05.653
(claps)

03:58:05.653 --> 03:58:09.830
and I'm going to have my duplicate swim up.

03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:11.550
MATT: All righty.

03:58:11.550 --> 03:58:16.450
LAURA: And pull out a little duplicate sequinsed glove,

03:58:16.450 --> 03:58:18.590
and wave it around and be like,

03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:20.470
here's your other offering!
(blows raspberry)

03:58:20.470 --> 03:58:23.310
And cast Banishment.
MATT: Through him?

03:58:24.220 --> 03:58:26.385
LAURA: Through my duplicate, yeah.
MATT: Okay.

03:58:26.385 --> 03:58:28.885
And that is Charisma, right?
LIAM: Charisma, yeah.

03:58:28.885 --> 03:58:30.320
Come on, Jester.

03:58:30.320 --> 03:58:31.153
MATT: That's a fail.

03:58:31.153 --> 03:58:33.611
He's going to use his last
Legendary Resistance to resist it.

03:58:33.611 --> 03:58:34.852
MARISHA: Last one.
TRAVIS: His last.

03:58:34.852 --> 03:58:37.110
LIAM: All right.

03:58:37.110 --> 03:58:38.680
MARISHA: It would've been funny if it was me and him

03:58:38.680 --> 03:58:42.470
hanging out in the Abyss, though. (laughs)

03:58:42.470 --> 03:58:44.320
LAURA: Oops!
ASHLEY: He just bamfs right next to you.

03:58:44.320 --> 03:58:46.220
MATT: However, Yasha, I need you
to make a Charisma saving throw.

03:58:46.220 --> 03:58:48.653
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: Is it Yasha? He would choose Yasha?

03:58:48.653 --> 03:58:50.410
He wouldn't choose Veth or something, because...

03:58:50.410 --> 03:58:51.790
MATT: Actually, you know what, you're right.

03:58:51.790 --> 03:58:55.292
Yasha, hang there.

03:58:56.460 --> 03:58:58.185
Instead...
LAURA: I don't know why I switched to Veth.

03:58:58.185 --> 03:59:00.570
I thought your Charisma was high
but then I realized yours is also low.

03:59:00.570 --> 03:59:03.203
SAM: Don't worry, I'll be fine.
MATT: Yasha hasn't been a huge threat at this point.

03:59:03.203 --> 03:59:05.495
He's not aware of that.
Instead he's going to go ahead

03:59:05.495 --> 03:59:08.297
and Caduceus, make a Charisma saving throw.

03:59:08.297 --> 03:59:10.154
TALIESIN: I haven't done shit. All right.

03:59:11.029 --> 03:59:12.044
LIAM: Where is Cad on the board?

03:59:12.044 --> 03:59:13.603
I don't see him on there.

03:59:15.610 --> 03:59:17.820
TALIESIN: Ooh. 16?

03:59:18.900 --> 03:59:20.857
MATT: What's your spell DC?
LAURA: Uh-oh. (laughs)

03:59:20.857 --> 03:59:23.231
MATT: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Oh, for Pete--

03:59:23.231 --> 03:59:28.223
(laughter)

03:59:29.720 --> 03:59:32.150
TALIESIN: Do I see you?
MARISHA: Does he see me?

03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:33.900
MATT: Where were you sending?
LAURA: Same place.

03:59:33.900 --> 03:59:35.525
MATT: Same place?
LIAM: Wow.

03:59:36.500 --> 03:59:40.124
MATT: Roll a d20 for me, Caduceus.
MARISHA: Come on, come on!

03:59:40.124 --> 03:59:41.920
MATT: If it's an 11--
TALIESIN: Nine.

03:59:41.920 --> 03:59:44.780
MATT: Nine. So, no it is not the same place.

03:59:44.780 --> 03:59:46.630
10 or higher, you were going to be in the same place.

03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:49.618
So, you suddenly go into a brief moment of darkness,

03:59:49.618 --> 03:59:51.240
find yourself now floating

03:59:51.240 --> 03:59:54.860
in the same gossamer space, seeing the distant sparkles

03:59:54.860 --> 03:59:56.920
and weird, distant winds

03:59:56.920 --> 04:00:01.260
that look almost like deep clouds in space

04:00:01.260 --> 04:00:03.740
with large shadowed land masses in the distance,

04:00:03.740 --> 04:00:04.940
and you hear a distant...

04:00:04.940 --> 04:00:06.480
Sounds like a whale.

04:00:06.480 --> 04:00:08.408
A very deep, resonant whale

04:00:08.408 --> 04:00:11.890
(whale bellowing)
behind you.

04:00:11.890 --> 04:00:14.450
And you turn and look, and there is a shadow.

04:00:14.450 --> 04:00:16.200
You're not sure how far away,

04:00:16.200 --> 04:00:18.058
but it is getting slowly bigger.

04:00:18.058 --> 04:00:19.885
SAM: Oh, Jesus.
ASHLEY: Uh-oh.

04:00:19.885 --> 04:00:21.675
MATT: And bigger.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:24.467
MARISHA: And I don't see him anywhere?
We are not in the same--

04:00:24.467 --> 04:00:26.866
MATT: No.
MARISHA: Fuck! That would've been fun at least.

04:00:26.866 --> 04:00:30.310
TRAVIS: Just two bodies going-- (screaming)

04:00:30.310 --> 04:00:32.600
MARISHA: We'll die together!
MATT: (laughs)

04:00:32.600 --> 04:00:35.505
MATT: You guys are 700 light years away.

04:00:35.505 --> 04:00:37.320
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

04:00:37.320 --> 04:00:40.620
MATT: All right. Jester, that finish your turn?

04:00:40.620 --> 04:00:41.750
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:43.660
So you're not moving at all? You're staying put?

04:00:43.660 --> 04:00:45.776
LAURA: I'm going to swim forward.

04:00:47.560 --> 04:00:48.960
MATT: To there?

04:00:48.960 --> 04:00:50.866
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to get as close as I can,

04:00:50.866 --> 04:00:53.660
because everything's moving.
MATT: That'll put you there.

04:00:53.660 --> 04:00:55.080
All righty, finishing Jester's go.

04:00:55.080 --> 04:00:57.040
Veth, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

04:00:58.600 --> 04:00:59.860
Wherever you are.

04:00:59.860 --> 04:01:03.009
SAM: I guess I'll move 15 feet.

04:01:03.009 --> 04:01:03.842
MATT: Okay.

04:01:05.080 --> 04:01:08.596
That'll put you about there.

04:01:09.755 --> 04:01:11.655
SAM: Dash 15 feet. (laughing)

04:01:12.900 --> 04:01:15.810
I can't do anything from farther than 30, right?

04:01:17.310 --> 04:01:18.540
MATT: That's as far as you can get.

04:01:18.540 --> 04:01:22.043
SAM: And I will also use my action
to go another 15 feet.

04:01:22.043 --> 04:01:25.768
MATT: Okay. Put you about there.

04:01:25.768 --> 04:01:28.960
SAM: Am I within range? No.
MATT: You don't know.

04:01:30.030 --> 04:01:31.630
SAM: Well, that's it.
MATT: All right.

04:01:31.630 --> 04:01:32.960
Finishes Veth's turn.

04:01:32.960 --> 04:01:35.200
Caduceus, you are out in the middle of nowhere,

04:01:35.200 --> 04:01:37.880
with this strange, looming shadow coming towards you.

04:01:38.820 --> 04:01:41.290
TALIESIN: Can I move? Am I on solid ground, or...?

04:01:41.290 --> 04:01:42.660
MATT: No, you're just floating in space.

04:01:42.660 --> 04:01:45.341
TALIESIN: Floating in space, and
there's a weird shadow coming at me?

04:01:45.341 --> 04:01:47.810
MATT: You have been in a similar
space before in the Happy Fun Ball,

04:01:47.810 --> 04:01:48.880
and you do recall when you were there

04:01:48.880 --> 04:01:51.500
that you just willed yourself in a direction
and you floated where you--

04:01:51.500 --> 04:01:53.360
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and find some cover.

04:01:53.360 --> 04:01:56.044
MATT: Okay. You look around.
(laughter)

04:01:56.044 --> 04:01:59.170
There is a rocky mass.

04:01:59.170 --> 04:02:00.727
Once again, not sure how big it is,

04:02:00.727 --> 04:02:03.100
but it's slowly drifting, an upward angle.

04:02:03.100 --> 04:02:04.530
You start gliding towards it,

04:02:04.530 --> 04:02:06.200
and it gets ever so slightly bigger,

04:02:06.200 --> 04:02:07.625
and with the little bit of movement you go,

04:02:07.625 --> 04:02:09.215
"Ah, it's like a half-mile away."

04:02:09.215 --> 04:02:11.260
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Fuck, okay.

04:02:11.260 --> 04:02:12.990
LIAM: It's that forced perspective again.

04:02:12.990 --> 04:02:14.493
MARISHA: Yeah, it works great, I'm telling you.

04:02:14.493 --> 04:02:17.185
LIAM: Is that Ian McKellen? I can't
tell if it's six feet tall, or...

04:02:17.185 --> 04:02:19.857
TRAVIS: 'Til you realize it's just a toe.

04:02:19.857 --> 04:02:20.973
MARISHA: Ooh.

04:02:20.973 --> 04:02:22.390
TALIESIN: There's no way I can just--

04:02:22.390 --> 04:02:25.420
MARISHA: Didn't expect you here.
TALIESIN: Back to earth, is there? No.

04:02:25.420 --> 04:02:28.950
MATT: You cast Banishment on yourself? Sure.
TALIESIN: Who knows where I'll show up, right?

04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:30.883
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I can't pinpoint target where I'm going.

04:02:30.883 --> 04:02:32.558
MATT: Correct.

04:02:32.558 --> 04:02:33.933
MARISHA: He makes the hobbits look so--

04:02:33.933 --> 04:02:35.000
LAURA: Sorry.
TALIESIN: Sounds like a terrible idea.

04:02:35.000 --> 04:02:37.240
LIAM: If it was me, I'd stay.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

04:02:37.240 --> 04:02:40.378
TRAVIS: Burned the Resistance, though.
TALIESIN: I'm just going to--

04:02:40.378 --> 04:02:42.161
SAM: That's his last, I think. Maybe.

04:02:42.161 --> 04:02:44.860
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
LIAM: He said it was.

04:02:46.296 --> 04:02:48.662
TALIESIN: I'm just going to hold a, uh--

04:02:49.654 --> 04:02:53.671
Sacred Flame in case anything tries to do anything to me,

04:02:53.671 --> 04:02:56.480
but I'm going to try and just keep chill and quiet.

04:02:56.480 --> 04:02:58.191
MATT: Okay. I'm checking one thing real fast.

04:02:58.191 --> 04:03:00.080
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: I love it.

04:03:01.380 --> 04:03:04.690
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm just going
to cast Resistance on myself

04:03:04.690 --> 04:03:05.910
and just try and chill.

04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:08.140
TRAVIS: Resistance to...?
TALIESIN: Resistance is just--

04:03:08.140 --> 04:03:08.973
TRAVIS: Space whale?

04:03:08.973 --> 04:03:11.680
TALIESIN: It's just a bonus to a saving throw.

04:03:11.680 --> 04:03:14.630
TRAVIS: Cool, cool.
TALIESIN: If I choose to take it.

04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:15.900
TRAVIS: You're like that guy that got left behind

04:03:15.900 --> 04:03:17.160
by the scuba expedition.

04:03:17.160 --> 04:03:18.340
You're just floating in the sea.

04:03:18.340 --> 04:03:19.740
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of this,

04:03:19.740 --> 04:03:20.990
you still maintain concentration,

04:03:20.990 --> 04:03:22.030
though you're on a different plane,

04:03:22.030 --> 04:03:24.060
because the spell is still being concentrated on.

04:03:24.060 --> 04:03:25.800
I'll say there is still that thread that connects there.

04:03:25.800 --> 04:03:27.380
TALIESIN: Oh, then yeah, I'm not doing anything, then.

04:03:27.380 --> 04:03:30.290
MATT: Right, right.
TALIESIN: I'm going to wait here

04:03:30.290 --> 04:03:31.770
and just keep my eyes open

04:03:31.770 --> 04:03:34.530
and hope that that thing is not coming towards me.

04:03:34.530 --> 04:03:36.300
MATT: All right. You can hold an action if you want.

04:03:36.300 --> 04:03:37.910
TALIESIN: I will hold a Sacred Flame just in case.

04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:38.780
MATT: Sacred Flame, you got it.

04:03:38.780 --> 04:03:40.050
All right, finishing your go, Caduceus.

04:03:40.050 --> 04:03:42.170
Fjord, you're up.

04:03:42.170 --> 04:03:45.475
LAURA: I cast a concentration spell through my duplicate,

04:03:46.350 --> 04:03:49.020
which is also concentration, so should we just say

04:03:49.020 --> 04:03:52.600
that she disappears?
MATT: Wait, what do you mean?

04:03:52.600 --> 04:03:56.700
LAURA: I cast Banishment, which is a concentration spell,

04:03:56.700 --> 04:03:58.580
through my duplicate.
MATT: Oh, got you.

04:03:58.580 --> 04:04:00.180
So she vanishes.
LAURA: So either she vanishes,

04:04:00.180 --> 04:04:02.160
or the Banishment didn't take hold.

04:04:02.160 --> 04:04:03.110
MATT: No, it super ends.

04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:05.990
So she vanishes, and the Banishment goes off.

04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.823
So, there you go.

04:04:06.823 --> 04:04:08.240
Good call, thank you for looking out on that.

04:04:08.240 --> 04:04:10.250
SAM: Also, as I was swimming by,

04:04:10.250 --> 04:04:13.559
I act scared of Fjord's thing.
MATT: (laughs)

04:04:13.559 --> 04:04:15.478
MATT and SAM: (screaming)

04:04:15.478 --> 04:04:17.290
SAM: But I'm still swimming right by it.

04:04:17.290 --> 04:04:18.430
MATT: You got it.
(laughter)

04:04:18.430 --> 04:04:20.920
Okay. That finishes his go.

04:04:20.920 --> 04:04:22.510
Fjord, you're up. Beau, you're on deck.

04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:25.136
TRAVIS: Do we want to drive it further away?

04:04:25.136 --> 04:04:25.969
LAURA: No.
LIAM: No.

04:04:25.969 --> 04:04:27.635
TRAVIS: Distance is a problem?
LAURA: No, distance sucks, man.

04:04:27.635 --> 04:04:29.220
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: Bring it in, if you can.

04:04:29.220 --> 04:04:34.213
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my action
to move astral dreadnought lite.

04:04:35.760 --> 04:04:38.460
It has a range of 120 feet, so it can go...

04:04:38.460 --> 04:04:40.660
Let's go bring it up this way, closer...

04:04:40.660 --> 04:04:42.649
MATT: Okay. You will need to see where it's going,

04:04:42.649 --> 04:04:44.130
so you probably have to--
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:04:44.130 --> 04:04:45.820
I'll actually use all 35 of my feet

04:04:45.820 --> 04:04:49.920
to come around this side.
LIAM: You have 35 feet?

04:04:49.920 --> 04:04:50.860
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: 30. 30 feet.

04:04:50.860 --> 04:04:54.100
SAM: He's a millipede.
LIAM: (babbling)

04:04:54.100 --> 04:04:56.440
MATT: So, okay, with that, that'll put you up and over.

04:04:56.440 --> 04:04:58.120
It's 10 feet, 15, 20 feet.

04:04:58.120 --> 04:04:59.160
So that would get you right there.

04:04:59.160 --> 04:05:00.318
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

04:05:01.297 --> 04:05:03.092
TALIESIN: Won't it be funny if--

04:05:03.092 --> 04:05:07.886
TRAVIS: Wonder if I should go wide,
just around this side of it.

04:05:07.886 --> 04:05:09.360
MATT: On that side? Okay.

04:05:09.360 --> 04:05:11.680
So that'll put you about--
TRAVIS: So I'm not--

04:05:11.680 --> 04:05:13.520
MATT: -- there, we'll say.
TRAVIS: Cool, that's great.

04:05:13.520 --> 04:05:16.540
And then I'll move the bubble this way

04:05:16.540 --> 04:05:18.320
back to this side.
MATT: Back to here?

04:05:18.320 --> 04:05:23.160
TRAVIS: Yeah. Try and herd him back towards the doggies.

04:05:23.160 --> 04:05:25.594
MATT: So, the dreadnought
(rushing water)

04:05:25.594 --> 04:05:27.990
whips around alongside the wall

04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:30.800
and is now almost floating a little higher,

04:05:30.800 --> 04:05:32.520
exactly where it is on this direction,

04:05:32.520 --> 04:05:34.210
and it's giving that same roar.

04:05:34.210 --> 04:05:37.110
TRAVIS: And let's just say that he went above,

04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:40.080
so he's forcing him down towards the floor.

04:05:40.080 --> 04:05:41.760
There's no escape.
MATT: Right. Pushing it down?

04:05:41.760 --> 04:05:44.631
Okay. As it moves, the head shifts all the eyes,

04:05:44.631 --> 04:05:46.770
and you can see it's now already moving its physicality

04:05:46.770 --> 04:05:49.530
to try and prepare and react to its shifting.

04:05:49.530 --> 04:05:53.910
TRAVIS: Okay. That is my ... turn.

04:05:53.910 --> 04:05:55.140
MATT: So it's an action to make that shift.

04:05:55.140 --> 04:05:55.973
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: You got it.

04:05:55.973 --> 04:05:57.510
Okay. Finishing Fjord's go.

04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:59.690
Beau, you are floating out in space.

04:05:59.690 --> 04:06:01.006
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:06:04.454 --> 04:06:05.287
Do I see anything?

04:06:05.287 --> 04:06:07.390
LIAM: Make the best of it.
MATT: Make a perception check.

04:06:10.746 --> 04:06:13.967
MARISHA: Yeah, okay. 21.

04:06:13.967 --> 04:06:14.980
MATT: 21?
MARISHA: For the Perception check.

04:06:14.980 --> 04:06:16.350
MATT: Okay.

04:06:16.350 --> 04:06:19.080
Glancing around, (sighs)

04:06:19.080 --> 04:06:22.820
you don't see anything in your immediate visual sight,

04:06:22.820 --> 04:06:24.180
and as you glance down below,

04:06:24.180 --> 04:06:29.040
you can see some sort of a massive shape.

04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:29.920
LAURA: Oh, god.

04:06:29.920 --> 04:06:31.610
MATT: Once again, uncertain of the distance.

04:06:31.610 --> 04:06:33.000
TALIESIN: Hey, you're on the other side.

04:06:33.000 --> 04:06:34.660
MARISHA: Totally. You're above it, I guess.

04:06:34.660 --> 04:06:36.820
TALIESIN: So far.
MARISHA: Yeah, but potentially miles.

04:06:36.820 --> 04:06:39.210
Yeah.
TALIESIN: Small dimension.

04:06:39.210 --> 04:06:41.260
MARISHA: So small.
MATT: So, you notice that.

04:06:43.054 --> 04:06:44.778
MARISHA: I can't do anything, can I?

04:06:44.778 --> 04:06:46.136
LAURA: Can you hold actions?
MATT: Whatever you want to do.

04:06:46.136 --> 04:06:47.870
You can hold actions, if you want to.

04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:49.178
LAURA: In case?

04:06:49.178 --> 04:06:53.794
MARISHA: I will ... hold my action.

04:06:53.794 --> 04:06:56.400
TRAVIS: Punch the giant floating thing.

04:06:56.400 --> 04:06:59.240
MARISHA: Punch on arrival.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

04:06:59.240 --> 04:07:00.420
SAM: Just parkour.
MATT: That finishes Beau's go.

04:07:00.420 --> 04:07:02.312
Caleb, you're up.
LIAM: Hold for Galactus.

04:07:02.312 --> 04:07:05.960
I am so far away from Vokodo

04:07:05.960 --> 04:07:07.760
that I am just going to try to get closer,

04:07:07.760 --> 04:07:10.320
and I am going to wave my hands in the air

04:07:10.320 --> 04:07:12.610
and cast Expeditious Retreat.
MATT: Okay.

04:07:12.610 --> 04:07:15.850
LIAM: So I can move a full 30
forward towards the cephalopod.

04:07:15.850 --> 04:07:17.642
MATT: You got it. You can drop concentration on a spell

04:07:17.642 --> 04:07:18.930
whenever you want to on your turn, by the way.

04:07:18.930 --> 04:07:20.530
LIAM: I know, but I'm also too far away

04:07:20.530 --> 04:07:22.060
to do anything of real use.

04:07:22.060 --> 04:07:22.970
I want to get closer to him,

04:07:22.970 --> 04:07:24.410
so that is what I want to do.
MATT: Okay.

04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:25.950
LAURA: But you can drop concentration,

04:07:25.950 --> 04:07:27.110
so that you can bring Beau back.

04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:28.630
LIAM: Yes, of course.

04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:30.950
I want Beau to come back, so Beau, come back.

04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:32.247
MATT: There you go, that's what I was asking.

04:07:32.247 --> 04:07:34.770
SAM: (laughs)
MATT: ♪ Beau, come back. ♪

04:07:34.770 --> 04:07:36.150
TRAVIS: ♪ Beau, come back! ♪

04:07:36.150 --> 04:07:38.310
MATT: All right, and with that, Beauregard.

04:07:38.310 --> 04:07:39.860
LIAM: Either way--

04:07:39.860 --> 04:07:41.940
MATT: -- you reappear in the space where you are

04:07:41.940 --> 04:07:44.091
and as soon as you come back,
(rushing)

04:07:44.091 --> 04:07:45.990
you give out two punches and there's nothing there.

04:07:45.990 --> 04:07:46.823
Immediately you look around

04:07:46.823 --> 04:07:48.830
and begin taking stock of how things have shifted,

04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:51.140
with Vokodo moving now further back.

04:07:51.140 --> 04:07:54.481
There's a massive

04:07:55.810 --> 04:07:57.485
astral dreadnought on the opposite side of the chamber

04:07:57.485 --> 04:07:59.220
that is roaring, and for a brief second once again,

04:07:59.220 --> 04:08:00.550
you have to take a moment to remind yourself,

04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:01.850
probably not real.

04:08:01.850 --> 04:08:03.390
Probably.

04:08:03.390 --> 04:08:06.410
So, Caleb. You're moving, Expeditious Retreat.

04:08:06.410 --> 04:08:07.243
LIAM: Straight forward.
MATT: 30.

04:08:07.243 --> 04:08:09.860
LIAM: 30 feet I can do, if I use movement.

04:08:09.860 --> 04:08:11.290
MATT: 30.
LIAM: And my action.

04:08:11.290 --> 04:08:13.530
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Cast as a bonus.

04:08:13.530 --> 04:08:14.363
MATT: You got it, there you go.

04:08:14.363 --> 04:08:16.840
So you're now 30 feet ahead, and there you are.

04:08:16.840 --> 04:08:17.673
Is that your turn?

04:08:17.673 --> 04:08:19.210
LIAM: That's it. I got nothing else I can do at the moment.

04:08:19.210 --> 04:08:22.580
MATT: All right. Top of the lair action round.

04:08:22.580 --> 04:08:24.803
TRAVIS: Fuck me.
TALIESIN: Hey!

04:08:25.768 --> 04:08:27.610
(laughter)

04:08:27.610 --> 04:08:30.008
TALIESIN: All right.
SAM: Marbles.

04:08:30.008 --> 04:08:32.608
(laughter)

04:08:32.608 --> 04:08:34.270
TALIESIN: Cool. Cool, cool cool, cool.

04:08:34.270 --> 04:08:36.100
MATT: He's going to go ahead, as part of this,

04:08:36.100 --> 04:08:39.020
the eyes shift and look towards Beauregard,

04:08:39.020 --> 04:08:40.763
who's appeared again.
SAM: Oh, no!

04:08:41.740 --> 04:08:44.358
MATT: And you feel this strange
sparkle sensation around you,

04:08:44.358 --> 04:08:46.490
(impact)
as the Bless is dispelled.

04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:47.920
SAM: Oh. Okay.

04:08:47.920 --> 04:08:49.520
Not so bad.
LIAM: Okay, not so bad.

04:08:50.820 --> 04:08:52.820
LIAM: Just on everything.

04:08:52.820 --> 04:08:54.695
TRAVIS: She can't talk. Where'd she go?

04:08:54.695 --> 04:08:58.180
(laughter)

04:08:58.180 --> 04:09:01.870
MARISHA: I'm literally drawing
pictures of a giant space whale

04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:04.883
with Beau just trapped in space.

04:09:04.883 --> 04:09:06.606
LAURA: Oh, no!
MARISHA: My catharsis doodle right now.

04:09:06.606 --> 04:09:09.681
LIAM: You just turned into a Pink
Floyd album for six seconds.

04:09:09.681 --> 04:09:11.500
MARISHA: (laughs) I did.

04:09:11.500 --> 04:09:16.425
MATT: Vilya's going to go ahead
and now swim forward 60 feet.

04:09:17.308 --> 04:09:18.799
TRAVIS: Let's go!

04:09:18.799 --> 04:09:20.305
LIAM: ♪ Wish you were here. ♪

04:09:20.305 --> 04:09:22.933
MATT: 30.
MARISHA: (laughs)

04:09:22.933 --> 04:09:24.790
MATT: She's going to be right about here.

04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:25.870
MARISHA: I'm on fire.

04:09:25.870 --> 04:09:26.703
TRAVIS: She's so close.

04:09:26.703 --> 04:09:30.130
That's, like, 15 feet out of melee?

04:09:30.130 --> 04:09:31.488
MATT: Correct.

04:09:33.520 --> 04:09:35.730
Does not want causing lightning

04:09:35.730 --> 04:09:36.580
to hit anybody else,

04:09:36.580 --> 04:09:41.445
so is going to drop concentration spell

04:09:41.445 --> 04:09:43.500
and is going to use her action to move up,

04:09:44.550 --> 04:09:47.440
to swim up as an orca on the other side of Vokodo.

04:09:47.440 --> 04:09:48.273
TRAVIS: Nice.

04:09:48.273 --> 04:09:49.230
MATT: And try and pincer him there.

04:09:49.230 --> 04:09:50.360
Can't get an attack this round,

04:09:50.360 --> 04:09:53.900
but is at least just starting to close him into that space.

04:09:53.900 --> 04:09:56.210
Finishing Vilya's turn, it is now Vokodo's turn.

04:09:56.210 --> 04:09:58.970
Top of Vokodo's turn, everybody takes...

04:09:58.970 --> 04:10:01.949
TRAVIS: Everybody takes!
MATT: Eight points of fire damage.

04:10:01.949 --> 04:10:04.018
ASHLEY: ♪ Everybody take, everybody take. ♪

04:10:04.018 --> 04:10:04.851
LIAM: No.

04:10:04.851 --> 04:10:06.605
SAM and MARISHA: ♪ Everybody take, everybody take! ♪

04:10:06.605 --> 04:10:07.438
TRAVIS: (grunting in rhythm)

04:10:07.438 --> 04:10:09.495
LIAM: ♪ Everybody take, everybody take. ♪

04:10:09.495 --> 04:10:11.911
SAM: ♪ Everybody take fire damage! ♪

04:10:11.911 --> 04:10:14.290
(laughter)

04:10:14.290 --> 04:10:17.865
TALIESIN: You know, it's kind of nice
in another dimension right now.

04:10:19.724 --> 04:10:20.732
I'm feeling pretty chill.

04:10:20.732 --> 04:10:23.718
TRAVIS: This is nice.
TALIESIN: This is fine.

04:10:23.718 --> 04:10:25.040
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Just floating.

04:10:25.040 --> 04:10:27.610
LIAM: Eight total?
MATT: Eight total, yes.

04:10:27.610 --> 04:10:30.918
LIAM: Thank you.
LAURA: Caduceus is so happy.

04:10:30.918 --> 04:10:35.918
SAM: Do three weird people in two-dimensional glass...

04:10:36.174 --> 04:10:38.200
TALIESIN: (imitates choral singing)
SAM: ...glass things just float by?

04:10:38.200 --> 04:10:39.080
TALIESIN: Phantom Zone?

04:10:39.080 --> 04:10:42.740
MATT: Vokodo, furiously now, at this point, surrounded,

04:10:42.740 --> 04:10:47.190
angrily is going to attempt to move this way

04:10:47.190 --> 04:10:49.290
to get out of the pincered scenario.

04:10:49.290 --> 04:10:52.700
So he's going to shift away from Vilya,

04:10:52.700 --> 04:10:54.730
which does get an attack of opportunity on him

04:10:54.730 --> 04:10:56.550
with the giant orca.

04:10:56.550 --> 04:10:58.931
TALIESIN: When you get an attack
of opportunity, shit's fucked.

04:10:58.931 --> 04:11:01.240
LAURA: And Yasha gets to hit him!
ASHLEY: Do I get an Attack?

04:11:01.240 --> 04:11:04.830
MATT: You do when we get to it.
TRAVIS: You are back.

04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:06.440
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: She's conscious.

04:11:06.440 --> 04:11:08.250
SAM: But you have willpower?

04:11:08.250 --> 04:11:09.390
LIAM: Yeah, she's back.
SAM: Oh, wow.

04:11:09.390 --> 04:11:11.310
MATT: So, Vilya's going to attack there with this,

04:11:11.310 --> 04:11:13.770
which is a plus six to hit.

04:11:13.770 --> 04:11:15.730
Misses, unfortunately.

04:11:15.730 --> 04:11:19.203
Yasha, however, as Vokodo shifts around this way

04:11:19.203 --> 04:11:22.010
and attempts to move out of that space this way,

04:11:22.010 --> 04:11:24.203
go ahead and make an attack of opportunity.

04:11:24.203 --> 04:11:25.688
ASHLEY: Wait!

04:11:28.900 --> 04:11:32.131
I don't have a--
LAURA: Add a d4, add a d4!

04:11:32.131 --> 04:11:36.058
(intense music)

04:11:36.058 --> 04:11:37.862
SAM: (humming to music)

04:11:37.862 --> 04:11:40.845
LIAM: Man, wouldn't it be great if Dieter were here?

04:11:40.845 --> 04:11:41.678
LAURA: (laughs)

04:11:41.678 --> 04:11:43.760
SAM: What if he shows up right now?

04:11:43.760 --> 04:11:44.870
LAURA: That'd be so great.
ASHLEY: 12.

04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:48.900
MARISHA: "I changed my mind!"
MATT: 12 misses.

04:11:48.900 --> 04:11:51.000
He is forced to the ground, however.

04:11:51.000 --> 04:11:53.730
Is not floating, not swimming above, but is now,

04:11:53.730 --> 04:11:55.460
because of the astral dreadnought, pushed away,

04:11:55.460 --> 04:11:58.690
and is going to go ahead and shift angrily this way.

04:11:58.690 --> 04:12:00.326
TRAVIS: You're not raging or anything yet?

04:12:00.326 --> 04:12:03.420
TALIESIN: Not yet.
ASHLEY: No.

04:12:03.420 --> 04:12:05.830
SAM: No, Travis! No.
MATT: Moving away from that,

04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:07.660
furious as the swings move behind.

04:12:10.480 --> 04:12:12.450
Sees you, as the arcane caster, Caleb--

04:12:12.450 --> 04:12:14.200
LIAM: Oh, yeah, good. Very good.

04:12:14.200 --> 04:12:16.300
MATT: -- and angrily is going to go ahead and focus.

04:12:17.200 --> 04:12:20.790
Mouth opens up, and you see the glow of heat on the inside

04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:23.420
begin to glow bright, bright, bright.

04:12:23.420 --> 04:12:26.600
Then you see (crackling).

04:12:26.600 --> 04:12:28.390
It looks similar to the energy

04:12:28.390 --> 04:12:32.210
that swirls around Yasha when she was playing her harp,

04:12:32.210 --> 04:12:34.300
or similar to the bolts of lightning

04:12:34.300 --> 04:12:35.660
that were being drawn from the storm above.

04:12:35.660 --> 04:12:39.000
It's now starting to dissipate above the chamber.

04:12:39.000 --> 04:12:40.280
But it's red.

04:12:40.280 --> 04:12:44.680
Whenever you see those images of tornadoes or volcanoes

04:12:44.680 --> 04:12:47.630
with the red lightning storms around it,

04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:50.730
this charges up (crackling, bursting)

04:12:50.730 --> 04:12:51.800
and fires out towards you.

04:12:51.800 --> 04:12:55.180
LIAM: Is this a casting? Counterspell.

04:12:55.180 --> 04:12:56.900
MATT: Counterspell, all right.
LAURA: (groaning)

04:12:56.900 --> 04:12:58.510
Go ahead and roll to counter it.

04:12:58.510 --> 04:13:00.220
SAM and LIAM: (exaggerated German accent) Counterspell.

04:13:00.220 --> 04:13:01.880
MATT: So, roll a d20, add your Intelligence modifier.

04:13:01.880 --> 04:13:03.020
SAM: Counterspell.

04:13:03.020 --> 04:13:04.450
LIAM: Add my Intelligence modifier?

04:13:04.450 --> 04:13:06.940
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay. It's 28.

04:13:06.940 --> 04:13:09.120
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: Not your saving throw.

04:13:09.120 --> 04:13:09.953
Your Intelligence modifier.

04:13:09.953 --> 04:13:12.390
LIAM: Oh, my modifier? Then it's a 23.

04:13:12.390 --> 04:13:13.610
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: 23.

04:13:13.610 --> 04:13:14.782
Fucking Counterspell, man.

04:13:14.782 --> 04:13:17.582
(laughter and cheering)

04:13:17.582 --> 04:13:19.550
ASHLEY: Yes!
SAM: What was that going to be?

04:13:19.550 --> 04:13:21.650
TRAVIS: Fuck.
MATT: You'll never know.

04:13:21.650 --> 04:13:24.897
TRAVIS: Red Lightning of Pain and Misery.

04:13:24.897 --> 04:13:26.320
LIAM: Would've been my total hit points.

04:13:26.320 --> 04:13:28.220
TRAVIS: Yeah, could've been.

04:13:28.220 --> 04:13:31.073
MATT: Okay, that's going to finish Vokodo's turn.

04:13:33.058 --> 04:13:34.060
(laughter)

04:13:34.060 --> 04:13:36.090
TRAVIS: We love you, Matt. This is amazing.

04:13:36.090 --> 04:13:38.310
TALIESIN: Still dying, man. Still dying.

04:13:38.310 --> 04:13:39.143
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

04:13:39.143 --> 04:13:40.234
SAM: You're the DM!
LAURA: Yasha!

04:13:40.234 --> 04:13:42.850
SAM: You can just say there's no more Counterspelling.

04:13:42.850 --> 04:13:43.770
MATT: No!

04:13:43.770 --> 04:13:46.120
LIAM: Just nix it.
MATT: No, Counterspell's great.

04:13:46.120 --> 04:13:47.336
It's going to be really great

04:13:47.336 --> 04:13:48.760
when other mages start fighting you guys,

04:13:48.760 --> 04:13:49.730
because then I can just counter all your shit.

04:13:49.730 --> 04:13:51.060
LIAM: Not going to happen this story.

04:13:51.060 --> 04:13:53.860
MATT: No, not at all. There's no
other mages possibly in the narrative.

04:13:53.860 --> 04:13:55.151
TRAVIS: Nope!

04:13:55.151 --> 04:13:55.993
MATT: Yasha.

04:13:55.993 --> 04:13:58.460
ASHLEY: For starters, I would like to <i>rage</i>!

04:13:58.460 --> 04:14:00.130
ALL: Yeah!

04:14:00.130 --> 04:14:02.250
SAM: About time.
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:14:03.450 --> 04:14:06.295
SAM: Let's do this.
ASHLEY: All right.

04:14:06.295 --> 04:14:08.450
LAURA: (laughs)

04:14:08.450 --> 04:14:10.800
ASHLEY: Fucking piece of shit!

04:14:10.800 --> 04:14:12.420
MATT: Are you moving towards him?

04:14:12.420 --> 04:14:14.782
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm going to move towards him.

04:14:14.782 --> 04:14:16.510
(laughter)
MATT: 5, 10, 15, 20.

04:14:16.510 --> 04:14:19.270
You swim up just enough to get into combat.

04:14:19.270 --> 04:14:21.220
So first, are you doing reckless or--?

04:14:23.780 --> 04:14:25.180
ASHLEY: Wait, did I just roll one?

04:14:27.530 --> 04:14:29.430
No, because rage-- yes, yes.

04:14:29.430 --> 04:14:31.200
Yeah, I'm going to do reckless.

04:14:31.200 --> 04:14:33.033
I'm going to do reckless.

04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:36.740
That's worse. Okay.

04:14:36.740 --> 04:14:39.931
ASHLEY: (stammering)

04:14:39.931 --> 04:14:41.397
What was the initial?

04:14:42.960 --> 04:14:44.240
I'm so sorry.
MATT: It's okay.

04:14:44.240 --> 04:14:45.073
TALIESIN: Welcome back.

04:14:46.498 --> 04:14:47.540
MATT: And Jester, you're next.

04:14:47.540 --> 04:14:49.090
LAURA: Oh.
ASHLEY: 15 for the first hit.

04:14:49.090 --> 04:14:50.540
TRAVIS: And a d4 for Bless?

04:14:50.540 --> 04:14:52.760
ASHLEY: That's with the d4.
TALIESIN: Is that with the d4? Fuck.

04:14:52.760 --> 04:14:54.700
MATT: You swing wide.

04:14:54.700 --> 04:14:56.920
As you're catching up, you thought you were closer

04:14:56.920 --> 04:14:58.800
and you miss it by inches.

04:14:58.800 --> 04:15:00.100
Using the momentum as you back-swing,

04:15:00.100 --> 04:15:02.276
you can go in for another strike upward.

04:15:02.276 --> 04:15:05.116
ASHLEY: Natural one.

04:15:05.116 --> 04:15:07.073
MATT: (sighing)
TRAVIS: Wow.

04:15:07.073 --> 04:15:08.490
MATT: Wait, natural one on both die?

04:15:08.490 --> 04:15:09.360
ASHLEY: Oh, no, no, no.

04:15:09.360 --> 04:15:10.710
I didn't roll twice.

04:15:12.640 --> 04:15:13.740
I rolled two natural ones.

04:15:13.740 --> 04:15:15.460
MARISHA: No way!

04:15:15.460 --> 04:15:17.525
MATT: Ashley!
TRAVIS: What is going on?

04:15:17.525 --> 04:15:19.480
ASHLEY: I don't know what's happening.
TALIESIN: All of those dice are gone forever now.

04:15:19.480 --> 04:15:20.313
You got to--
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:15:20.313 --> 04:15:22.260
LAURA: I don't know how to get it to you.

04:15:22.260 --> 04:15:24.273
ASHLEY: No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

04:15:24.273 --> 04:15:27.182
MATT: Ashley!
LAURA: Here's my whole bag.

04:15:27.182 --> 04:15:28.015
MATT: All right.

04:15:28.015 --> 04:15:30.100
You were already raging.

04:15:30.100 --> 04:15:33.949
Now you are fucking furious!

04:15:33.949 --> 04:15:36.359
MARISHA: Wow. That's rough.

04:15:36.359 --> 04:15:37.770
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn, Yasha.

04:15:37.770 --> 04:15:39.340
Jester, you're up. Veth, you're on deck.

04:15:39.340 --> 04:15:40.400
ASHLEY: Just Weakest Link me right now.

04:15:40.400 --> 04:15:42.880
LIAM: Do you want me to send you to the Astral--?

04:15:42.880 --> 04:15:45.635
TALIESIN: It's nice.
ASHLEY: No. (sighs)

04:15:45.635 --> 04:15:46.468
SAM: You know why?

04:15:46.468 --> 04:15:48.360
It's because Yasha didn't sleep well last night,

04:15:48.360 --> 04:15:49.960
because of your dreams.

04:15:49.960 --> 04:15:51.600
LAURA: I'm going to drop one Banishment.

04:15:52.450 --> 04:15:53.700
Wait, but I'm going to wait.

04:15:54.974 --> 04:15:56.970
Because I'm going to cast another Banishment,

04:15:56.970 --> 04:15:58.960
so it's going to cancel, probably.

04:15:58.960 --> 04:16:00.380
MATT: Yeah, that'll happen.
LAURA: Yeah.

04:16:00.380 --> 04:16:01.980
MATT: Okay, cast another Banishment.

04:16:05.021 --> 04:16:06.320
That is a charisma, right?

04:16:06.320 --> 04:16:07.153
LAURA: Yeah.

04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:10.820
MATT: As he's rushing away from the creature,

04:16:10.820 --> 04:16:12.100
and Yasha's missing,

04:16:12.100 --> 04:16:15.490
that large bolt of energy that strikes out and vanishes.

04:16:15.490 --> 04:16:16.590
Furiously, you can see

04:16:16.590 --> 04:16:19.200
its eyes are growing brighter and brighter with anger.

04:16:19.200 --> 04:16:20.780
It's still looking back with one eye

04:16:20.780 --> 04:16:21.613
at the astral dreadnought,

04:16:21.613 --> 04:16:24.193
and then (rushing) it vanishes from view.

04:16:24.193 --> 04:16:25.090
TRAVIS: Where'd you send him? Where'd you send him?

04:16:25.090 --> 04:16:27.225
Where'd you send him?

04:16:27.225 --> 04:16:30.110
LAURA: To the Astral Sea.

04:16:30.110 --> 04:16:30.943
To his home plane.

04:16:30.943 --> 04:16:32.050
MATT: If they're from something else,

04:16:32.050 --> 04:16:34.020
it sends them back to their home plane, yeah.

04:16:34.020 --> 04:16:36.050
TRAVIS: Which is--

04:16:36.050 --> 04:16:38.320
LAURA: As long as I can keep the concentration up,

04:16:38.320 --> 04:16:39.153
he'll stay there.

04:16:39.153 --> 04:16:41.295
TALIESIN: And then I bounce back?
MATT: And you bounce back.

04:16:41.295 --> 04:16:42.128
TALIESIN: Ah!

04:16:42.128 --> 04:16:44.687
SAM: My god, he turned into Caduceus!

04:16:44.687 --> 04:16:46.685
(laughter)

04:16:46.685 --> 04:16:48.080
LAURA: Bless me!
SAM: Kill Caduceus!

04:16:48.080 --> 04:16:51.300
SAM: Bless me! Do something
so I don't drop my concentration!

04:16:51.300 --> 04:16:53.930
MARISHA: We should get you out of here.

04:16:53.930 --> 04:16:55.470
SAM: Oh, there's lair actions.

04:16:55.470 --> 04:16:56.733
Everyone get around Jester. Protect her!

04:16:56.733 --> 04:16:58.584
MARISHA: We should get you out of here.

04:16:58.584 --> 04:16:59.870
Okay.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

04:16:59.870 --> 04:17:01.770
Caleb swims in and starts looking

04:17:01.770 --> 04:17:03.530
for any kind of--
SAM: Can you just make a shield?

04:17:03.530 --> 04:17:04.640
LIAM: Other than the boiling water.

04:17:04.640 --> 04:17:06.040
LAURA: The water's hot! The water's hot!

04:17:06.040 --> 04:17:07.863
We should get out before I take damage!

04:17:07.863 --> 04:17:09.630
MATT: So, Jester.
LAURA: What?

04:17:09.630 --> 04:17:12.847
MATT: What else are you doing on your turn? Is that it?

04:17:12.847 --> 04:17:16.020
LAURA: Oh. Um.
TALIESIN: Run?

04:17:16.020 --> 04:17:17.710
MARISHA: Swim!
MATT: I'm going to turn around

04:17:17.710 --> 04:17:20.240
and start swimming to get out of here.

04:17:20.240 --> 04:17:21.673
MATT: Okay.

04:17:22.547 --> 04:17:23.647
5, 10, 15-
(screen clattering)

04:17:23.647 --> 04:17:25.310
MATT: Oh god!
ALL: Ah!

04:17:25.310 --> 04:17:26.443
MATT: Oh god, oh no!

04:17:26.443 --> 04:17:28.710
TRAVIS: (laughs) That scared the shit out of me!

04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:29.650
(laughter)
MATT: Good!

04:17:29.650 --> 04:17:31.230
That'll teach you to pay attention!

04:17:31.230 --> 04:17:33.410
TRAVIS: Fuck me!

04:17:33.410 --> 04:17:35.390
MATT: It happens on occasion.
TRAVIS: He's back!

04:17:35.390 --> 04:17:36.990
MATT: All right, so that gets you--

04:17:38.450 --> 04:17:40.730
ASHLEY: Will he be gone forever if you just--

04:17:40.730 --> 04:17:42.788
LIAM: If she doesn't get fucked up.
ASHLEY: If you don't get fucked up.

04:17:42.788 --> 04:17:44.840
LIAM: For a minute.
SAM: She's about to take heat damage.

04:17:44.840 --> 04:17:45.673
ASHLEY: For a minute.

04:17:45.673 --> 04:17:46.663
MATT: Yeah, so you get about there, Jester.

04:17:46.663 --> 04:17:48.870
LAURA: But I took War Caster, so--
MATT: Okay, good.

04:17:48.870 --> 04:17:50.570
LIAM: So chances are decent.

04:17:50.570 --> 04:17:53.380
MARISHA: You just have to roll over damage,

04:17:53.380 --> 04:17:54.670
and the heat damage has been low.

04:17:54.670 --> 04:17:56.970
MATT: Finishes your turn, Jester. Veth, you're up.

04:17:58.326 --> 04:18:02.100
SAM: (exhales heavily)

04:18:02.100 --> 04:18:05.990
I'm going to swim down and hide in those rocks,

04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:08.380
and prepare and hold my shot

04:18:08.380 --> 04:18:11.280
until the thing comes back.

04:18:11.280 --> 04:18:12.407
Until the thing.

04:18:12.407 --> 04:18:13.390
MATT: You're hiding in those rocks right there?
SAM: Yeah.

04:18:13.390 --> 04:18:14.223
MATT: You got it.

04:18:14.223 --> 04:18:16.470
SAM: Hiding and waiting, and if I see it, I fire.

04:18:16.470 --> 04:18:18.912
MATT: You got it. Roll a stealth check.

04:18:20.280 --> 04:18:22.110
SAM: 25.

04:18:22.110 --> 04:18:25.680
MATT: Okay. Caduceus, you're up, and then it's Fjord.

04:18:25.680 --> 04:18:29.230
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to--

04:18:29.230 --> 04:18:31.070
LIAM: Where is Jester there?

04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:33.420
MARISHA: She's over here by the--
SAM: At the door.

04:18:33.420 --> 04:18:34.380
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: She's at the door.

04:18:34.380 --> 04:18:38.940
I'm going to re-cast Bless.
MATT: Re-cast Bless?

04:18:38.940 --> 04:18:42.580
TALIESIN: At level three. Who's within 30 feet of me?

04:18:42.580 --> 04:18:44.570
MATT: Everybody except for Yasha.

04:18:44.570 --> 04:18:47.660
TALIESIN: Okay.
MATT: So, Yasha's Bless goes away.

04:18:47.660 --> 04:18:49.890
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:18:49.890 --> 04:18:52.470
Let's see, I'm doing-- it's five targets?

04:18:52.470 --> 04:18:57.247
So one, two, three,

04:18:59.960 --> 04:19:02.140
four...

04:19:02.140 --> 04:19:03.750
I can't.

04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:06.100
Eenie meenie miney, five.

04:19:06.100 --> 04:19:07.349
We need those things to stay.

04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:09.559
MARISHA: Not you.
MATT: So, who is it?

04:19:10.500 --> 04:19:12.740
TALIESIN: Everybody but Sam.
MATT: At 3rd-level?

04:19:12.740 --> 04:19:13.880
You can get five people.

04:19:13.880 --> 04:19:16.810
TALIESIN: Yeah. One, two, three, four, five.

04:19:16.810 --> 04:19:18.480
MATT: So, Jester and Caleb?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:19:18.480 --> 04:19:20.650
MATT: Okay. So Veth loses it.

04:19:20.650 --> 04:19:23.292
TALIESIN: Everybody but Yasha and Veth.

04:19:23.292 --> 04:19:24.847
LIAM: That's a blessy Bless?

04:19:24.847 --> 04:19:25.870
TALIESIN: It's an extra d4

04:19:25.870 --> 04:19:28.360
on attacks and saves.
LIAM: Attacks and saves.

04:19:28.360 --> 04:19:29.750
MATT: Okay, you got it.

04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:31.170
TALIESIN: And I would've given you Freedom of Movement,

04:19:31.170 --> 04:19:32.003
but it was one or the other.

04:19:32.003 --> 04:19:33.970
And then I'm going to spend the rest of my turn

04:19:33.970 --> 04:19:37.410
moving in the direction of (whistles).

04:19:37.410 --> 04:19:40.230
LIAM: Remember, it took 10 or 15 or 20 minutes

04:19:40.230 --> 04:19:43.054
to get through the tunnels to get here, so that's--

04:19:43.054 --> 04:19:44.150
MATT: Yeah.

04:19:44.150 --> 04:19:46.130
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:19:46.130 --> 04:19:50.850
LIAM: Freedom of Movement.
MATT: That brings us to Fjord.

04:19:50.850 --> 04:19:54.940
TRAVIS: Yes. We're running, right?

04:19:54.940 --> 04:19:59.010
LAURA: I mean, I don't know.
TRAVIS: We're trying to get you out.

04:19:59.010 --> 04:20:00.680
LAURA: I don't-- It's not like we--

04:20:00.680 --> 04:20:01.840
LIAM: We need to last.

04:20:01.840 --> 04:20:03.610
LAURA: We just need to last for a minute.

04:20:04.920 --> 04:20:06.900
If I can keep it up for a minute.

04:20:06.900 --> 04:20:08.366
SAM: You've just got to get out of the lair.

04:20:08.366 --> 04:20:10.170
LIAM: We will not get through those tunnels.

04:20:10.170 --> 04:20:12.667
Never mind.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's true.

04:20:12.667 --> 04:20:13.500
LIAM: (pigeon cooing)

04:20:13.500 --> 04:20:17.590
TRAVIS: I am going to--
SAM: Underwater pigeon. (cooing)

04:20:17.590 --> 04:20:18.850
MATT: You get the sense the tunnels,

04:20:18.850 --> 04:20:20.160
and the water you came from,

04:20:20.160 --> 04:20:21.805
is all similarly heated.

04:20:21.805 --> 04:20:24.500
So going isn't going to change anything.

04:20:24.500 --> 04:20:25.860
TRAVIS: I'm going to move the astral dreadnought

04:20:25.860 --> 04:20:28.720
to the middle, above Yasha.

04:20:28.720 --> 04:20:30.228
MATT: How long does that last for?

04:20:30.228 --> 04:20:31.260
TRAVIS: 10 minutes.

04:20:31.260 --> 04:20:33.130
MATT: 10 minutes, you got it, yeah.

04:20:33.130 --> 04:20:36.166
TRAVIS: It's not real, Yasha!

04:20:36.166 --> 04:20:40.180
I'm going to swim over to where Jester is and just hover.

04:20:40.180 --> 04:20:43.640
MATT: Okay. You've got it.
TRAVIS: I have 30 feet.

04:20:43.640 --> 04:20:45.080
MATT: Okay. So you--

04:20:45.080 --> 04:20:47.460
TRAVIS: I'll put myself, I guess, in front of her.

04:20:47.460 --> 04:20:50.080
LAURA: Do you have ice armor?
MATT: Right here?

04:20:50.080 --> 04:20:51.538
LAURA: Is your armor cold?

04:20:53.971 --> 04:20:55.510
TRAVIS: Can I put that on somebody else?

04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:56.741
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: I can't.

04:20:56.741 --> 04:20:57.910
MATT: It's only on self for that.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:21:00.030 --> 04:21:01.590
MATT: All right. Beau, Caleb?

04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:05.820
MARISHA: I'm going to swim opposite where Fjord just went,

04:21:05.820 --> 04:21:07.720
and also just try to be nearby

04:21:07.720 --> 04:21:09.902
to protect Jester.
MATT: Right here, you mean?

04:21:09.902 --> 04:21:11.460
MARISHA: No, no, no, no.
MATT: Oh, over here?

04:21:11.460 --> 04:21:14.180
MARISHA: Yeah. Team Protect Jester.

04:21:14.180 --> 04:21:17.080
MATT: Yeah, you can get right here. Not an issue.

04:21:17.080 --> 04:21:19.187
MARISHA: I don't know what I'd protect her from.

04:21:19.187 --> 04:21:21.240
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: But that's what I got.

04:21:21.240 --> 04:21:25.800
And I'll hold my action in case he comes back.

04:21:25.800 --> 04:21:29.153
MATT: You got it. Veth, you're just staying hidden?

04:21:29.153 --> 04:21:33.220
SAM: We're not leaving?
LAURA: No, stay hidden.

04:21:33.220 --> 04:21:36.690
LIAM: I'm after Beau for initiative.

04:21:36.690 --> 04:21:37.523
MATT: Yeah. Oh, that's right, sorry.

04:21:37.523 --> 04:21:38.660
I forgot right there.

04:21:38.660 --> 04:21:40.440
LIAM: It's okay.
MATT: Sorry.

04:21:40.440 --> 04:21:42.490
LIAM: Caleb swims directly towards Jester

04:21:42.490 --> 04:21:44.910
and pulls out his Transmuter Stone,

04:21:44.910 --> 04:21:46.570
and shoves it into her hand,

04:21:46.570 --> 04:21:49.790
the lucky stone with the band around it.

04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:52.580
It is set to adding proficiency

04:21:53.440 --> 04:21:55.660
to constitution saves right now.

04:21:55.660 --> 04:21:57.100
So you're going to add your proficiency

04:21:57.100 --> 04:21:58.810
to any concentration check you make

04:21:58.810 --> 04:22:01.060
to hold Banishment.
LAURA: Oh, great! Okay.

04:22:01.060 --> 04:22:03.810
LIAM: As long as it's in a person's possession,

04:22:03.810 --> 04:22:05.218
they get that ability.
MATT: Okay.

04:22:05.218 --> 04:22:06.370
TRAVIS: Cool, cool.

04:22:06.370 --> 04:22:07.330
LIAM: That's the end of my turn.

04:22:07.330 --> 04:22:10.200
LAURA: That's great, okay.
MATT: All righty.

04:22:11.110 --> 04:22:15.000
So that brings us to everyone taking...

04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:18.610
seven points of fire damage.

04:22:18.610 --> 04:22:20.454
SAM: Yikes.

04:22:20.454 --> 04:22:21.870
MATT: So if everyone's holding,

04:22:21.870 --> 04:22:23.240
we'll come to Yasha in a second.

04:22:23.240 --> 04:22:24.648
MATT: Go ahead and roll two d20s.

04:22:24.648 --> 04:22:25.923
LAURA: Two? Okay.

04:22:25.923 --> 04:22:27.530
MATT: Because you have War Caster.
LAURA: Okay.

04:22:27.530 --> 04:22:29.320
MATT: Because you have to maintain concentration

04:22:29.320 --> 04:22:30.260
every time you take fire damage.

04:22:30.260 --> 04:22:31.093
LAURA: Right.

04:22:33.210 --> 04:22:36.310
Without a roll, it's already seven.

04:22:36.310 --> 04:22:40.330
MATT: Correct. So you have to get above a 10, total.

04:22:40.330 --> 04:22:41.830
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Or a 10 or above.

04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:43.280
TRAVIS: And you get Bless and stuff, right?

04:22:43.280 --> 04:22:44.790
LIAM: And you add your proficiency bonus too.

04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:47.400
LAURA: Right, okay. Oh, way, way great.

04:22:47.400 --> 04:22:48.630
MATT: Okay. So, that's the first round.

04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:50.470
LAURA: 15 plus seven.
MATT: You're fine.

04:22:50.470 --> 04:22:51.303
LAURA: Plus a four.

04:22:51.303 --> 04:22:52.565
MATT: Okay. Yasha, what are you doing?

04:22:54.080 --> 04:22:56.435
ASHLEY: (sighs) All right.

04:23:00.309 --> 04:23:02.060
I'm going to hang out here by this thing.

04:23:02.060 --> 04:23:03.660
MATT: Okay, yeah. If we're all hanging here,

04:23:03.660 --> 04:23:05.785
we're going to do a bunch of rounds of fire damage

04:23:05.785 --> 04:23:08.192
and saves to see if we can make it.

04:23:08.192 --> 04:23:10.090
So that's nine we have left to do.

04:23:10.090 --> 04:23:11.980
SAM: Nine rounds?

04:23:11.980 --> 04:23:13.530
MATT: Ooh. Everyone takes eight points of fire damage.

04:23:13.530 --> 04:23:15.110
SAM: Yikes.
LIAM: Wow.

04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:18.030
MARISHA: If anyone wants to heal...
LAURA: Natural 20!

04:23:18.890 --> 04:23:19.723
MATT: Great!

04:23:19.723 --> 04:23:21.410
MARISHA: Did you say eight or nine damage?

04:23:21.410 --> 04:23:22.360
MATT: Eight damage.

04:23:22.360 --> 04:23:24.410
TRAVIS: I actually will--
LAURA: We should heal.

04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:26.500
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and swim to the top of this cavern

04:23:26.500 --> 04:23:27.850
and just see what's up here,

04:23:27.850 --> 04:23:28.970
since we're doing it.
MATT: Okay.

04:23:28.970 --> 04:23:30.180
LAURA: Caduceus, can you heal people?

04:23:30.180 --> 04:23:31.258
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:23:31.258 --> 04:23:34.430
I was going to. I can do a--
TRAVIS: I'll do double dashes,

04:23:34.430 --> 04:23:36.273
so 60 feet each time.

04:23:36.273 --> 04:23:38.430
MATT: We'll say you're up at the very, very top.

04:23:38.430 --> 04:23:39.400
TRAVIS: Cool.

04:23:39.400 --> 04:23:41.310
MATT: Vilya's going to move.
TRAVIS: Just to see if it's liquid all the way,

04:23:41.310 --> 04:23:42.890
or if it's air or--

04:23:42.890 --> 04:23:44.770
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to--
TRAVIS: Magic elevator.

04:23:44.770 --> 04:23:45.918
MATT: No air.

04:23:45.918 --> 04:23:48.560
TALIESIN: I'm going to use our six seconds to--

04:23:48.560 --> 04:23:50.029
LIAM: Other spells that are not concentration.

04:23:50.029 --> 04:23:51.570
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah. So I'm going to use

04:23:51.570 --> 04:23:54.960
a round to do Mass Healing Word.

04:23:54.960 --> 04:23:57.563
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

04:23:57.563 --> 04:24:00.410
TALIESIN: Ooh. That's nine points healing to everybody.

04:24:01.550 --> 04:24:02.940
TRAVIS: Nine points healing.

04:24:02.940 --> 04:24:05.320
MATT: Everyone takes six points of fire damage.

04:24:05.320 --> 04:24:06.940
Go again, Jester.

04:24:09.020 --> 04:24:11.020
LAURA: Great.
MATT: Okay.

04:24:15.120 --> 04:24:16.390
Wow, eight points of fire damage.

04:24:16.390 --> 04:24:18.807
Rolling really well on these.

04:24:20.398 --> 04:24:22.572
TALIESIN: I'm doing another Mass Healing Word.
LAURA: Great.

04:24:22.572 --> 04:24:23.405
MARISHA: Thank you.

04:24:24.250 --> 04:24:25.540
LAURA: Wait, eight points on that one?

04:24:25.540 --> 04:24:26.800
Another Healing Word?

04:24:26.800 --> 04:24:28.390
TRAVIS: Hold on, not yet.
TALIESIN: And that's going to be,

04:24:28.390 --> 04:24:29.980
again, that's nine points to everybody.

04:24:29.980 --> 04:24:32.540
TRAVIS: Nine points of healing.

04:24:32.540 --> 04:24:35.390
LIAM: We're Heroes' Feast. Do we get max healing every time?

04:24:35.390 --> 04:24:36.570
MATT: No, it's not that.

04:24:36.570 --> 04:24:38.060
Five points of fire damage to everybody.

04:24:38.060 --> 04:24:39.130
TRAVIS: Five points of fire.

04:24:39.130 --> 04:24:41.160
MARISHA: How many is that? How many more do we have to do?

04:24:41.160 --> 04:24:43.290
SAM: It's dice versus dice!
MARISHA: It really is.

04:24:43.290 --> 04:24:44.456
LAURA: I'm great.

04:24:44.456 --> 04:24:46.114
LIAM: That's kind of D&amp;D.

04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:49.240
MATT: Four points of fire damage to everybody.

04:24:49.240 --> 04:24:51.640
TRAVIS and LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: (trilling)

04:24:51.640 --> 04:24:54.640
TALIESIN: I'm going to do another Healing Word.

04:24:56.605 --> 04:24:58.230
Nine points of healing.

04:24:58.230 --> 04:24:59.632
MARISHA: To everybody?
TALIESIN: Yep.

04:24:59.632 --> 04:25:00.465
LIAM: Wow.

04:25:01.967 --> 04:25:02.800
LAURA: Ooh!

04:25:02.800 --> 04:25:04.358
SAM: What a rollercoaster.

04:25:04.358 --> 04:25:05.710
MATT: Interesting point of order,

04:25:05.710 --> 04:25:06.543
just so you're aware,

04:25:06.543 --> 04:25:07.830
as you guys have a moment to think about it,

04:25:07.830 --> 04:25:10.480
and think about it--
TALIESIN: (counting)

04:25:10.480 --> 04:25:13.310
MATT: One, he was looking pretty hurt.

04:25:13.310 --> 04:25:15.560
Like, just tipped over into hurt.

04:25:15.560 --> 04:25:17.590
LIAM: Okay.

04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:19.820
MATT: And if he stays, so does all that treasure.

04:25:19.820 --> 04:25:21.730
LIAM: Yeah, no, no.
MATT: Just be aware.

04:25:21.730 --> 04:25:23.900
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have to drop one person every round,

04:25:23.900 --> 04:25:28.900
so I won't do you, so it'll be negative nine...

04:25:28.910 --> 04:25:29.743
LAURA: He was looking pretty hurt?

04:25:29.743 --> 04:25:31.310
MATT: He was starting to look pretty hurt, yeah.

04:25:31.310 --> 04:25:32.143
TALIESIN: Negative nine.

04:25:33.320 --> 04:25:34.510
MARISHA: Starting to look pretty hurt.

04:25:34.510 --> 04:25:35.850
TALIESIN: Nine, nine and--

04:25:35.850 --> 04:25:37.310
MATT: Three points of fire damage to everybody.

04:25:37.310 --> 04:25:39.150
TALIESIN: I'll take nine too.

04:25:39.150 --> 04:25:42.180
MATT: Jester, go ahead and make your concentration check.

04:25:42.180 --> 04:25:44.800
SAM: Should we let him come back and just pile on? No.

04:25:44.800 --> 04:25:45.770
LAURA: I mean, I guess everybody

04:25:45.770 --> 04:25:47.490
could get ready to attack him,

04:25:47.490 --> 04:25:48.580
and then the minute he comes in,

04:25:48.580 --> 04:25:49.721
we just unload everything.

04:25:49.721 --> 04:25:52.013
TRAVIS: We could do that.

04:25:53.520 --> 04:25:54.880
LIAM: As they shout to each other

04:25:54.880 --> 04:25:56.390
in the middle of--
SAM: Boiling water?

04:25:56.390 --> 04:25:58.585
LIAM: A minute counting down.

04:25:58.585 --> 04:25:59.993
LAURA: Yeah. What do you guys think?

04:25:59.993 --> 04:26:03.200
MATT: You've got three more rounds to decide.

04:26:03.200 --> 04:26:05.140
LAURA: We can gather around.

04:26:05.140 --> 04:26:06.570
SAM: We're changing the plan mid-plan?

04:26:06.570 --> 04:26:07.980
LAURA: If we're going to do it, we should do it.

04:26:07.980 --> 04:26:10.250
MARISHA: For the fifth time.
SAM: (laughs)

04:26:10.250 --> 04:26:11.240
LAURA: If we want the treasure.

04:26:11.240 --> 04:26:13.798
MATT: Seven points of fire damage to everybody.
LAURA: It's up to you guys.

04:26:14.990 --> 04:26:16.540
MARISHA: I just know it was a war of attrition.

04:26:16.540 --> 04:26:18.120
Beau's about to go down.

04:26:18.120 --> 04:26:19.147
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, if I'm low--

04:26:19.147 --> 04:26:21.347
SAM: The treasure could help a lot the people

04:26:21.347 --> 04:26:22.834
in the V.O. community!

04:26:22.834 --> 04:26:23.667
MATT: Oh no, what'd you get?

04:26:23.667 --> 04:26:25.508
LAURA: 10.
LIAM: It belongs to the people of the V.O. community.

04:26:25.508 --> 04:26:27.840
MATT: 10? 10, you barely scoot by.

04:26:27.840 --> 04:26:29.880
LAURA: I'd have to roll a one and a two in order to...

04:26:29.880 --> 04:26:32.090
MATT: Yeah, I know. I know.
LAURA: I rolled a one and a three.

04:26:32.090 --> 04:26:33.731
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a Mass Cure Wounds,

04:26:33.731 --> 04:26:35.710
just because we're here.

04:26:35.710 --> 04:26:36.852
It's the same thing with six, so I'm going to do--

04:26:36.852 --> 04:26:40.032
LAURA: Should I drop it?
TALIESIN: One, two--

04:26:41.208 --> 04:26:44.858
One, two, three, four, five.

04:26:44.858 --> 04:26:46.460
Yeah, I'm going to hit everyone but you at the moment.

04:26:46.460 --> 04:26:48.540
SAM: That's fine.
LAURA: Mass Cure Wounds?

04:26:48.540 --> 04:26:51.530
TALIESIN: Yeah, Mass Cure Wounds. So that's...

04:26:51.530 --> 04:26:53.330
Hold on.
TRAVIS: Who wants it to come back?

04:26:53.330 --> 04:26:55.460
SAM: I do, but we have to get into position already.

04:26:55.460 --> 04:26:58.180
LAURA: We literally have to swim around and get around

04:26:58.180 --> 04:27:00.350
to where we'd be able to hit it.
LIAM: What if we make a ring?

04:27:00.350 --> 04:27:01.983
LAURA: Go around him, go around him, go around him!

04:27:01.983 --> 04:27:03.270
ASHLEY: Make a ring, make a ring.
LIAM: He's not here.

04:27:03.270 --> 04:27:05.300
LAURA: Make a ring about where he was.

04:27:05.300 --> 04:27:07.265
ASHLEY: Can you bamf him in wherever you want?

04:27:07.265 --> 04:27:09.365
LAURA: No, he's going to come back where he was.

04:27:09.365 --> 04:27:10.600
If we're going to do it, do it!

04:27:10.600 --> 04:27:11.910
MATT: This is the last round to decide.

04:27:11.910 --> 04:27:13.170
MARISHA: All right, fine, fine.

04:27:13.170 --> 04:27:14.440
MATT: Or the fight's over,

04:27:14.440 --> 04:27:16.810
if you manage to not roll a one and a two.

04:27:16.810 --> 04:27:19.310
So your call.
LIAM: Yeah, he would stay, or...

04:27:20.230 --> 04:27:22.849
It's your call.
LAURA: No, it's not.

04:27:22.849 --> 04:27:25.930
LIAM: Yeah, it is.
MARISHA: One is safe and one is risky.

04:27:25.930 --> 04:27:27.810
LAURA: Treasure. Treasure?

04:27:27.810 --> 04:27:28.870
TRAVIS: There's so much shit on his back.

04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:31.620
There's so much untold stuff.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:27:31.620 --> 04:27:33.950
LIAM: Caleb wants that shit, but Caleb's not talking.

04:27:33.950 --> 04:27:36.993
He's just acting.
TRAVIS: Just Liam. (laughs)

04:27:36.993 --> 04:27:39.000
Come on!
LAURA: If we're going to do it,

04:27:39.000 --> 04:27:40.560
circle around him, because I'm not going to drop it if--

04:27:40.560 --> 04:27:42.230
SAM: I'm already ready!
TALIESIN: All right, I'm ready.

04:27:42.230 --> 04:27:44.410
MARISHA: I can circle.
LAURA: Can we get into a place?

04:27:44.410 --> 04:27:45.810
Everybody get in position around him?

04:27:45.810 --> 04:27:49.060
MARISHA: Oh my god, this is the
stupidest thing we have ever done.

04:27:49.060 --> 04:27:52.390
SAM: I'm going to cast Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt.

04:27:52.390 --> 04:27:56.130
MARISHA: I'm going to hold my attack,
and attack as soon as I see him.

04:27:56.130 --> 04:27:57.850
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit you with Holy Weapon.

04:27:57.850 --> 04:27:59.130
MATT: Make a perception check, Beauregard,

04:27:59.130 --> 04:28:00.930
to know where he vanished.

04:28:00.930 --> 04:28:03.160
ASHLEY: Can I try to go under where he would bamf

04:28:03.160 --> 04:28:04.810
so I'll be right under his belly?

04:28:04.810 --> 04:28:06.250
MATT: He was on the ground at that point,

04:28:06.250 --> 04:28:07.560
because he was trying to get away

04:28:07.560 --> 04:28:09.510
from the astral dreadnought,

04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:10.970
but you're right by where he was,

04:28:10.970 --> 04:28:12.140
so he'll appear right next to you.

04:28:12.140 --> 04:28:14.775
SAM: We just willingly took nine rounds of fire damage.

04:28:14.775 --> 04:28:15.798
MARISHA: You're tapping me for Holy Weapon?

04:28:15.798 --> 04:28:17.270
TALIESIN: Yep.
MARISHA: Okay.

04:28:17.270 --> 04:28:18.103
Wait, what does that do?

04:28:18.103 --> 04:28:20.520
An extra 2d8, right?
TALIESIN: It's...

04:28:20.520 --> 04:28:22.940
Extra 2d8.
MATT: All right, Bless goes away.

04:28:22.940 --> 04:28:24.090
TALIESIN: Yep, dropping Bless.

04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:28.613
MARISHA: Oh my god, this is stupid. Why did we do this?

04:28:28.613 --> 04:28:30.840
LAURA: Because he did it! He did this to us!

04:28:30.840 --> 04:28:31.673
He did this!

04:28:31.673 --> 04:28:34.080
TRAVIS: He appealed to our greed.
MARISHA: He totally did.

04:28:34.080 --> 04:28:35.908
He got in our fucking heads.

04:28:35.908 --> 04:28:38.110
SAM: (laughs)
MARISHA: He appealed to our greed.

04:28:38.980 --> 04:28:41.350
MATT: Hey, hey, I'm just saying.

04:28:41.350 --> 04:28:44.180
In that moment--
LAURA: Everybody get ready,

04:28:44.180 --> 04:28:45.180
and then I'm going to drop it,

04:28:45.180 --> 04:28:46.218
and everybody cast something, right?

04:28:46.218 --> 04:28:50.220
MATT: All right, so who's moving from where they are?

04:28:50.220 --> 04:28:51.990
LAURA: I'm going to try to be within 60 feet

04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:53.281
of where he went away.
LIAM: We're within order.

04:28:53.281 --> 04:28:55.430
We're not going to get to all attack him all together.

04:28:55.430 --> 04:28:56.263
LAURA: No, we do.

04:28:56.263 --> 04:28:57.970
MATT: If you all hold an action right as she releases it,

04:28:57.970 --> 04:28:59.150
you would all be able to.

04:28:59.150 --> 04:29:01.680
Everyone gets in.
TRAVIS: Like Ripley.

04:29:01.680 --> 04:29:02.513
LIAM: All right.

04:29:02.513 --> 04:29:03.590
MATT: You would have the opportunity to do that.

04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:06.410
LIAM: Disintegrate, if that's what we're doing.

04:29:06.410 --> 04:29:07.460
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Okay. All right.

04:29:07.460 --> 04:29:08.810
TRAVIS: Call it.
LAURA: Yes.

04:29:08.810 --> 04:29:10.793
MATT: Vilya's going to come over here.

04:29:11.918 --> 04:29:14.560
LAURA: He could deflect all of these at once.

04:29:14.560 --> 04:29:16.550
LIAM: Disintegrate could go to you.

04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:18.250
LAURA: But it's all happening at once, so...

04:29:18.250 --> 04:29:20.260
TALIESIN: I'm going to be 30 feet away, give or take.

04:29:20.260 --> 04:29:22.070
MATT: 30 feet away from him would be about...

04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:23.890
TALIESIN: Yeah, a little out of the group.

04:29:23.890 --> 04:29:26.078
A little off from the group.
SAM: Is Yasha able to join us?

04:29:26.078 --> 04:29:27.144
MATT: A little off from the group?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:29:27.144 --> 04:29:28.844
ASHLEY: Does it matter at this point?

04:29:28.844 --> 04:29:30.072
SAM: (laughs)
TRAVIS: Aw!

04:29:30.072 --> 04:29:32.069
ASHLEY: I'm going to roll a one.

04:29:32.069 --> 04:29:34.504
LAURA: You're going to get a
natural 20 on this one, I can feel it.

04:29:34.504 --> 04:29:36.010
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

04:29:36.854 --> 04:29:38.950
MARISHA: I'm going to laugh when you
get the How Do You Want to Do This.

04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:41.260
ASHLEY: There's no-- we're all going at the same time.

04:29:41.260 --> 04:29:44.343
LIAM: Even if you don't, we all eat shit.

04:29:44.343 --> 04:29:46.580
LAURA: All right. Everybody's prepped?

04:29:46.580 --> 04:29:47.830
ASHLEY: Yes.

04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:50.298
LAURA: Drop it, and everybody hits at the same time.

04:29:50.298 --> 04:29:54.544
MATT: Okay. So as you all prepare yourselves at the ready,

04:29:54.544 --> 04:29:56.070
in a very ballsy maneuver,

04:29:56.070 --> 04:30:00.068
Jester, at the last minute, releases Banishment.

04:30:00.068 --> 04:30:00.901
(magic pulsing)

04:30:00.901 --> 04:30:03.960
You watch as Vokodo immediately appears

04:30:03.960 --> 04:30:05.640
in the space where he vanished,

04:30:05.640 --> 04:30:10.640
with a look of absolute sheer fear and panic in his eyes.

04:30:10.710 --> 04:30:14.440
There is a screech you've never heard a creature make.

04:30:14.440 --> 04:30:17.540
He's been so guttural and frightening this entire time.

04:30:17.540 --> 04:30:18.970
Put Caduceus back on here.

04:30:18.970 --> 04:30:20.720
But the sound he makes when he arrives

04:30:20.720 --> 04:30:24.520
is this mournful, "No!"

04:30:26.306 --> 04:30:27.340
If this creature could shit its pants,

04:30:27.340 --> 04:30:29.364
it'd be shitting its pants right now.

04:30:29.364 --> 04:30:32.820
There is an absolute sense of desperate fear

04:30:32.820 --> 04:30:35.040
that's he's trying to swim away

04:30:35.040 --> 04:30:36.280
and is in the process of doing so

04:30:36.280 --> 04:30:37.113
as he arrives.

04:30:37.113 --> 04:30:38.150
All right, held actions.

04:30:38.150 --> 04:30:39.440
We'll go across the table here.

04:30:39.440 --> 04:30:40.400
Fjord, what are you doing?

04:30:40.400 --> 04:30:41.750
TRAVIS: I'm using the Relentless Hex

04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:44.570
to bamf in to five feet with him,

04:30:44.570 --> 04:30:47.550
and I'm going to hit him twice with the Star Razor.

04:30:47.550 --> 04:30:48.933
MATT: Go for it.

04:30:51.059 --> 04:30:52.390
TRAVIS: 16 plus...

04:30:52.390 --> 04:30:55.530
That's a million. That's 29 to hit.

04:30:55.530 --> 04:30:57.289
MATT: That hits.

04:30:57.289 --> 04:31:02.289
TRAVIS: I'm going to dump a
5th-level Divine Smite into this.

04:31:03.272 --> 04:31:06.449
So that's eight, seven, that's 15 plus...

04:31:06.449 --> 04:31:11.449
MARISHA: I can't believe we--
TRAVIS: 19 plus a d4.

04:31:11.700 --> 04:31:13.370
MATT: It's really fascinating.
LIAM: Yeah.

04:31:13.370 --> 04:31:15.020
MARISHA: We took damage for nine rounds.

04:31:15.020 --> 04:31:19.756
LIAM: I used D&amp;D Beyond to roll.
ASHLEY: To bring it back. (laughs)

04:31:19.756 --> 04:31:20.890
SAM: Oh, interesting.
LIAM: Yeah.

04:31:20.890 --> 04:31:25.543
TRAVIS: 22 plus 5d8, okay. Here we go.

04:31:25.543 --> 04:31:29.903
(counting)

04:31:29.903 --> 04:31:32.106
LIAM: I've always wanted to kill Marisha's character.

04:31:32.106 --> 04:31:34.505
(laughter)

04:31:34.505 --> 04:31:38.332
MARISHA: No, no, no! (disintegrating)

04:31:38.332 --> 04:31:40.578
LIAM: It was a hidden desire from campaign one,

04:31:40.578 --> 04:31:42.930
and now it can come to fruition.

04:31:42.930 --> 04:31:45.930
MARISHA: Keep your fetishes to yourself.
TRAVIS: That's 49 points of damage.

04:31:45.930 --> 04:31:48.752
LIAM: Artagan. That's Artagan's fetish.
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true.

04:31:48.752 --> 04:31:50.070
MATT: (exclaiming)

04:31:50.070 --> 04:31:51.450
LIAM: Wait, how much was it?
TRAVIS: 49.

04:31:51.450 --> 04:31:53.130
MATT: 49 points of damage.

04:31:53.130 --> 04:31:54.380
You take four points of fire damage

04:31:54.380 --> 04:31:56.610
as the fire blasts back against you.

04:31:56.610 --> 04:32:00.020
TRAVIS: Awesome. Second one is a 22 to hit.

04:32:00.020 --> 04:32:00.960
MATT: That hits.
ASHLEY: 22 points.

04:32:00.960 --> 04:32:04.548
LIAM: Goddamn, that was the first hit?! Paladin.

04:32:04.548 --> 04:32:08.092
Multiclass. C'mon now.

04:32:08.092 --> 04:32:09.370
MATT: Morkoth is nasty, man.

04:32:09.370 --> 04:32:14.370
TRAVIS: Five, seven is 12, plus a 14--
LAURA: Kill him. Kill him.

04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:18.250
Kill him.
TRAVIS: Is 17 points of

04:32:18.250 --> 04:32:20.630
fucking crazy-ass rune sword damage.

04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:21.676
MATT: Hell yeah. So

04:32:21.676 --> 04:32:23.580
(clashing) striking back,

04:32:23.580 --> 04:32:25.220
you can see you've carved this large chunk

04:32:25.220 --> 04:32:26.053
off the side of the body

04:32:26.053 --> 04:32:28.160
that shifts out, almost like a cake slice,

04:32:28.160 --> 04:32:31.690
and as it does, it exposes this raw interior magma.

04:32:31.690 --> 04:32:35.163
It screams, the pain is still there.

04:32:35.163 --> 04:32:36.780
It's so much damage, but it's still

04:32:36.780 --> 04:32:39.710
eyes are wild, and it's not even noticing your presence,

04:32:39.710 --> 04:32:40.543
it's so scared.

04:32:40.543 --> 04:32:41.757
TRAVIS: And I probably take fire damage on that second hit.

04:32:41.757 --> 04:32:43.660
MATT: You do. You take one point of fire damage.

04:32:43.660 --> 04:32:44.720
TRAVIS: Awesome.

04:32:44.720 --> 04:32:49.052
MATT: All righty. So Fjord was there.
I'm going to go back to the--

04:32:49.052 --> 04:32:50.130
We're just going to do this in initiative order as we go.

04:32:50.130 --> 04:32:53.160
Beau, you're up.
MARISHA: Oh, oh. Oh, jeez.

04:32:53.160 --> 04:32:55.600
Okay. Pop pop.

04:32:55.600 --> 04:32:57.090
MATT: I figured as opposed to going around the table,

04:32:57.090 --> 04:32:59.150
I would just go ahead and go down initiative order.

04:33:00.160 --> 04:33:04.894
MARISHA: That is 30 total-- sorry, 31 total to hit.

04:33:04.894 --> 04:33:06.569
MATT: That hits.
LIAM: (Irish accent) 30 damage.

04:33:06.569 --> 04:33:10.674
ALL: (in Irish accents) 30 damage.

04:33:11.943 --> 04:33:15.014
LIAM: It's me, Beauregard O'Lionett.

04:33:15.014 --> 04:33:17.470
MARISHA: 2d8 holy, right?

04:33:17.470 --> 04:33:20.050
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: So I'm rolling 3d8 for this.

04:33:20.050 --> 04:33:25.050
Do I get-- Okay, okay, okay. Sorry.

04:33:25.050 --> 04:33:28.030
Okay. (exhales)

04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:32.985
17 plus five is 22 damage.

04:33:32.985 --> 04:33:36.676
17 plus five is 22 damage.

04:33:36.676 --> 04:33:38.410
MATT: 22 points of damage, nice.

04:33:38.410 --> 04:33:42.120
MARISHA: With some of that being holy.

04:33:42.120 --> 04:33:44.560
MATT: It's not really anything to add,

04:33:44.560 --> 04:33:47.471
so it just goes--
SAM and MARISHA: (mumbles) I don't know.

04:33:47.471 --> 04:33:51.508
MARISHA: And okay.

04:33:51.508 --> 04:33:53.770
27 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

04:33:53.770 --> 04:33:55.206
You can roll damage for the next one.

04:33:55.206 --> 04:33:57.257
MARISHA: (babbling)

04:33:57.257 --> 04:33:59.344
So nervous!
LAURA: We're all so nervous!

04:33:59.344 --> 04:34:03.051
MARISHA: Ah, okay.

04:34:03.051 --> 04:34:07.000
10, 15, 16, 17...

04:34:07.000 --> 04:34:08.504
Another 22 damage.
SAM: Jeez, Louise.

04:34:08.504 --> 04:34:10.290
MATT and ASHLEY: Nice.

04:34:10.290 --> 04:34:11.982
MATT: Can't believe you Counterspelled his Chain Lightning.

04:34:11.982 --> 04:34:14.000
I'm so angry.
SAM: Ooh, Chain Lightning!

04:34:14.000 --> 04:34:15.304
TALIESIN: Fuck!
MATT: Nasty.

04:34:15.304 --> 04:34:17.437
LAURA: Oh my god.

04:34:17.437 --> 04:34:18.950
TRAVIS: and ASHLEY: (lightning crackling)

04:34:18.950 --> 04:34:23.320
MATT: 8d10 lightning damage to four targets.
MARISHA: And I can only do my held action, right?

04:34:23.320 --> 04:34:24.660
MATT: That was your held action, so that's all you get.

04:34:24.660 --> 04:34:26.150
MARISHA: That's what I get.
TRAVIS: ♪ You're welcome. ♪

04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:30.350
MATT: All right. Now that brings us to Caleb.

04:34:30.350 --> 04:34:32.690
LIAM: Yeah, Disintegrate. Dexterity save.

04:34:32.690 --> 04:34:34.610
I already rolled it using D&amp;D Beyond,

04:34:34.610 --> 04:34:39.090
and it's a 72, unless you make your dex save.

04:34:39.090 --> 04:34:40.440
MATT: (exhaling)

04:34:40.440 --> 04:34:41.714
LIAM: (magic pulsing)

04:34:41.714 --> 04:34:42.672
MATT: Does anybody in this party

04:34:42.672 --> 04:34:44.877
have over 72 hit points at the moment?

04:34:44.877 --> 04:34:46.880
SAM: (gasping)
LIAM: Pass.

04:34:46.880 --> 04:34:48.520
TRAVIS: Yes.
SAM: You don't know.

04:34:48.520 --> 04:34:49.777
MATT: It's true, I don't know.
TALIESIN: No, you don't.

04:34:49.777 --> 04:34:52.990
LIAM: (laughs)
TALIESIN: You know for some of us.

04:34:52.990 --> 04:34:55.570
MATT: If this goes wrong, I already have my target.

04:34:55.570 --> 04:34:57.420
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Dexterity, you said, right?

04:34:57.420 --> 04:34:59.270
LIAM: Make it Jester.

04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:04.490
TRAVIS: Come on, say it.
SAM: Natural 20.

04:35:04.490 --> 04:35:06.840
MATT: I can't have anybody come over here to look at this.

04:35:06.840 --> 04:35:07.920
TRAVIS: I can, I can--
LIAM: You got a 20?

04:35:07.920 --> 04:35:09.200
LAURA: Oh, no, no, no!

04:35:10.630 --> 04:35:12.296
MATT: I'll step away.
LIAM: Just tell us, we'll believe it!

04:35:12.296 --> 04:35:13.500
TRAVIS: Is it that clear one?

04:35:13.500 --> 04:35:16.200
MATT: No, it's the golden purple--
LAURA: Is it a 20 or is it a one?

04:35:16.200 --> 04:35:19.110
TRAVIS: I see it.
LIAM: 20?

04:35:19.110 --> 04:35:21.240
MARISHA: What is it? Is it bad?
LIAM: It's a 20.

04:35:21.240 --> 04:35:22.990
It's going to go to who he wants it to.

04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:24.510
MATT: So, Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah.

04:35:24.510 --> 04:35:26.380
MATT: As you are preparing the spell,

04:35:26.380 --> 04:35:28.530
and you bring it back, you feel the arcane energy

04:35:28.530 --> 04:35:29.730
crackling in your fingers.
LIAM: Right.

04:35:29.730 --> 04:35:32.840
I break open a bag of dust, underwater--

04:35:32.840 --> 04:35:35.765
MATT: Which floats for a second.
LIAM: -- press the lodestone through.

04:35:35.765 --> 04:35:38.480
I'm going to kill Vokodo, obviously.

04:35:38.480 --> 04:35:39.687
(magic pulsing)

04:35:39.687 --> 04:35:41.060
MATT: And as you release the green ray,

04:35:41.060 --> 04:35:44.900
you watch as Vokodo, eyes wild, there's this shimmer

04:35:44.900 --> 04:35:47.810
as the kinetic, psychic energy around it

04:35:47.810 --> 04:35:50.470
that seems to be deflecting the spells

04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:53.570
pushes against and resists the spell

04:35:53.570 --> 04:35:55.140
and then fails.

04:35:55.140 --> 04:35:56.317
How do you want to do this?

04:35:56.317 --> 04:35:57.395
(exclaiming)

04:35:57.395 --> 04:35:58.778
LIAM: You're fucked with my head!

04:35:58.778 --> 04:35:59.861
MATT: Rolled a natural one.

04:35:59.861 --> 04:36:01.807
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: Fucking natural one.

04:36:01.807 --> 04:36:03.440
LIAM: Rolled a-- what did you say?
MATT: A natural one.

04:36:03.440 --> 04:36:05.422
LIAM: Whoa, a one, not a 20!

04:36:05.422 --> 04:36:07.135
TRAVIS: I didn't want to say anything.

04:36:07.135 --> 04:36:09.200
LAURA: I really, really thought it
was going to kill one of us!

04:36:09.200 --> 04:36:11.340
LIAM: The light that has been gleaming out of its mouth

04:36:11.340 --> 04:36:12.770
all this time,

04:36:12.770 --> 04:36:17.040
the beam of dark green energy leaves the palm of my hand

04:36:17.040 --> 04:36:18.750
like Spider-Man (web shooting)

04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:20.900
and goes straight through that light,

04:36:20.900 --> 04:36:23.420
pierces through, right through,

04:36:23.420 --> 04:36:26.840
and to stay thematically with our episode,

04:36:26.840 --> 04:36:29.424
goes in the mouth and out the butthole.

04:36:29.424 --> 04:36:31.530
(laughter)
Straight through in a line.

04:36:31.530 --> 04:36:32.363
MATT: All right.

04:36:32.363 --> 04:36:33.764
LIAM: Thank you for whoever laughed.

04:36:33.764 --> 04:36:36.470
(laughter)

04:36:36.470 --> 04:36:39.730
TALIESIN: From the ether.

04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.983
TALIESIN: Fuck.
LAURA: That's not going to

04:36:42.983 --> 04:36:44.886
disintegrate all of his treasure, right?

04:36:44.886 --> 04:36:46.770
SAM: Yes, it will.
LIAM: No, no, it's magic.

04:36:46.770 --> 04:36:49.070
Magic stuff does not disintegrate.

04:36:50.064 --> 04:36:50.897
(paper rustling)

04:36:50.897 --> 04:36:52.200
TALIESIN: That would've been a lot.
LAURA: Is he looking

04:36:52.200 --> 04:36:53.562
to see if it disintegrates everything on him?

04:36:53.562 --> 04:36:55.569
SAM: No, he's looking to see what the--

04:36:55.569 --> 04:37:00.319
LIAM: The Deck of Many Things cards scatter in the water.
SAM: -- erupting volcano has already killed.

04:37:01.310 --> 04:37:04.870
MATT: As the green ray fires through Vokodo's form,

04:37:04.870 --> 04:37:09.750
the wild panic somehow grows more desperate.

04:37:09.750 --> 04:37:11.100
At first it looks like it missed,

04:37:11.100 --> 04:37:13.440
or it did no serious damage.

04:37:13.440 --> 04:37:16.190
But you watch from the pinpoint hole

04:37:16.190 --> 04:37:18.250
that has been carved through the body,

04:37:18.250 --> 04:37:21.450
its interior begins to just disassociate

04:37:21.450 --> 04:37:24.300
into sludge around the outside of it.

04:37:24.300 --> 04:37:26.573
It's being cored from the center out.

04:37:26.573 --> 04:37:29.440
And as it's screaming,

04:37:29.440 --> 04:37:32.787
this wave of violent, psychic energy

04:37:32.787 --> 04:37:33.620
(energy blasting)

04:37:33.620 --> 04:37:35.080
bursts out through all of you.

04:37:35.080 --> 04:37:37.800
Your vision is suddenly not yours,

04:37:37.800 --> 04:37:40.290
as the psychic energy released

04:37:40.290 --> 04:37:42.360
pierces into your brain,

04:37:42.360 --> 04:37:46.180
and your mind is clouded with a flash of vision

04:37:46.180 --> 04:37:48.650
after vision after vision after vision after vision.

04:37:50.000 --> 04:37:52.260
The scream that hurts, your ears are bleeding,

04:37:52.260 --> 04:37:54.530
your eyes are bleeding and clouding in the water,

04:37:54.530 --> 04:37:55.430
but you don't even notice,

04:37:55.430 --> 04:38:00.430
because you're just seeing in your mind's eye

04:38:00.530 --> 04:38:05.530
a gossamer sky of purples and blacks and greens and blues,

04:38:05.880 --> 04:38:07.600
the Astral Sea itself,

04:38:07.600 --> 04:38:11.170
clouded with distant shattering pieces.

04:38:11.170 --> 04:38:14.120
An endless sea of stars and possibility.

04:38:14.120 --> 04:38:17.470
Flashes of something in shadow, large, ominous,

04:38:17.470 --> 04:38:19.245
monolithic.

04:38:20.450 --> 04:38:22.042
A city.

04:38:22.042 --> 04:38:27.041
A city that is moving under its own power.

04:38:28.120 --> 04:38:32.720
Hunting. Moving with will.

04:38:32.720 --> 04:38:35.990
Following. You feel the fear of Vokodo.

04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:38.790
You feel it trying to escape.

04:38:38.790 --> 04:38:43.790
You feel this city hungry and chasing.

04:38:44.370 --> 04:38:46.750
You flash into the streets of the city.

04:38:46.750 --> 04:38:48.940
You see paved roads.

04:38:48.940 --> 04:38:51.360
You see buildings and towers.

04:38:51.360 --> 04:38:54.790
And they flick and bend, organically,

04:38:54.790 --> 04:38:57.720
shift like they're alive.

04:38:57.720 --> 04:38:59.625
Roads pulse.

04:39:00.940 --> 04:39:04.542
This is weirdly familiar, but so alien.

04:39:06.550 --> 04:39:11.240
Thousands of minds within are the city.

04:39:11.240 --> 04:39:16.240
It doesn't make sense. Hungry, seeking.

04:39:16.980 --> 04:39:18.570
There's another flash.

04:39:18.570 --> 04:39:21.980
Within the minds of Eyes of Nine,

04:39:21.980 --> 04:39:25.450
flash back, the vessel, the city draws close.

04:39:25.450 --> 04:39:30.120
Fear. Flee. Break through.

04:39:30.120 --> 04:39:33.190
Break and drag. Obfuscate.

04:39:33.190 --> 04:39:36.340
With its last power, you feel Vokodo attempt to flee

04:39:36.340 --> 04:39:37.880
and break through the barriers,

04:39:37.880 --> 04:39:38.960
dragging with it the pieces

04:39:38.960 --> 04:39:41.880
to flee from whatever this thing,

04:39:41.880 --> 04:39:46.880
this entity, this form, was.

04:39:47.150 --> 04:39:49.420
And right as those memories flash,

04:39:49.420 --> 04:39:51.650
the screaming subsides,

04:39:51.650 --> 04:39:54.530
and your vision begins to come back to

04:39:54.530 --> 04:39:55.940
as the rest of the body of Vokodo

04:39:55.940 --> 04:39:58.470
just drifts into floating sludge

04:39:58.470 --> 04:40:00.770
and waterlogged ash.

04:40:00.770 --> 04:40:05.770
The rest of the remnants of its gold, treasure,

04:40:06.240 --> 04:40:09.398
falling and clattering to the floor of the chamber.

04:40:11.123 --> 04:40:12.700
For a moment, you all look around and now notice

04:40:12.700 --> 04:40:17.698
the blood that now sits floating from every facial orifice,

04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:20.960
and the look in each other's eyes,

04:40:20.960 --> 04:40:23.340
you get the sense that you all just experienced the same,

04:40:23.340 --> 04:40:25.290
or something very similar.

04:40:26.950 --> 04:40:28.561
And that's where we're going to end tonight's episode.

04:40:28.561 --> 04:40:30.711
(groaning)
SAM: What the fuck was that?

04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:35.596
TRAVIS: Hey, great call bringing him back.
LAURA: We didn't even freaking die!

04:40:35.596 --> 04:40:37.774
TRAVIS: Great call bringing him back!

04:40:37.774 --> 04:40:40.750
SAM: We did everything right.

04:40:40.750 --> 04:40:43.970
We did it all perfectly!
TRAVIS: Just like we planned it.

04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:46.015
SAM: Oh, guys.
TALIESIN: A well-oiled copy of Mousetrap.

04:40:46.015 --> 04:40:48.650
LIAM: (like Stefon from SNL) This battle had everything.

04:40:48.650 --> 04:40:50.950
It had boiling water.

04:40:50.950 --> 04:40:53.140
It had ricocheting spells.
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

04:40:53.140 --> 04:40:54.770
Did the city...

04:40:54.770 --> 04:40:56.020
LAURA: Oh, I want to know about that city.

04:40:56.020 --> 04:40:57.730
TALIESIN: Is it anything I saw in my vision, or no?

04:40:57.730 --> 04:41:01.351
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: Was it like the Chained Oblivion?

04:41:01.351 --> 04:41:02.184
SAM: Wow.

04:41:02.184 --> 04:41:04.550
MATT: It was weird. It was very weird.

04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:06.040
Very alien, very nightmare-like.

04:41:06.040 --> 04:41:09.087
TRAVIS: Moving. Not static, moving.
MATT: Static and then moving.

04:41:09.087 --> 04:41:09.920
And static.

04:41:09.920 --> 04:41:11.660
LAURA: Like the Ring girl?
MATT: Kind of.

04:41:11.660 --> 04:41:12.493
TRAVIS: Shut--!

04:41:12.493 --> 04:41:15.350
No, there's no association that he gave to that!

04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:16.750
MATT: It would seem rigid,

04:41:16.750 --> 04:41:21.140
and then it would tense, like muscles,

04:41:21.140 --> 04:41:25.380
and then become suddenly curved and organic,

04:41:25.380 --> 04:41:26.260
and then shift back.

04:41:26.260 --> 04:41:27.200
LAURA: We know the city.

04:41:27.200 --> 04:41:30.100
TALIESIN: It's going to be totally
driving you mad, isn't it?

04:41:30.100 --> 04:41:31.740
TALIESIN: Right now, chat is freaking the fuck out.

04:41:31.740 --> 04:41:34.890
MATT: So, sorry for the long episode,

04:41:34.890 --> 04:41:37.030
but we've been building up to this boss fight.

04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:38.580
We'll come back here next week

04:41:38.580 --> 04:41:40.750
and pick up from where we left off,

04:41:40.750 --> 04:41:45.750
this vision in the center of a boiling volcano interior.

04:41:45.890 --> 04:41:46.723
LAURA: Oh god, that's right.

04:41:46.723 --> 04:41:48.005
The volcano's--
TRAVIS: It's erupting.

04:41:48.005 --> 04:41:51.050
MATT: And hopefully--
LIAM: We don't have seven hours to pick through

04:41:51.050 --> 04:41:51.883
this treasure.
MATT: Yeah.

04:41:51.883 --> 04:41:52.820
Well, here's the thing.

04:41:52.820 --> 04:41:54.270
The fight's over. Water's still hot.

04:41:54.270 --> 04:41:55.700
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: So we're going to pick up there

04:41:55.700 --> 04:41:56.877
next week.

04:41:56.877 --> 04:42:00.630
But thank you all so much for joining us.

04:42:00.630 --> 04:42:02.390
Don't forget, we love you very much,

04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:04.420
and is it Thursday yet?

04:42:04.420 --> 04:42:06.631
Good night.
TRAVIS: Oh, so good!

00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:03.504
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:06.979
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. And Sam makes noise from his

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.761
phone over there. Strangely.

00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:11.816
SAM: I can't turn it off! It won't stop!

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:21.304
MATT: So a couple things. One, you'll notice that
we're down two players tonight. That's because

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:30.433
apparently some babies can't wait! So there is
currently a new addition to the Critical Role team

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:31.556
right now--

00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:33.873
(cheering)

00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:41.078
MATT: More information will be made available as
the parents see fit. I'm glad that I worked

00:00:41.078 --> 00:00:47.203
towards a narrative exit for them that they
couldn't be there for. So anyway--

00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:49.274
ASHLEY: We love you, Travis and Laura!

00:00:49.274 --> 00:00:51.293
MATT: Super excited. We love you guys so much,
seriously.

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:52.573
MARISHA: We love you!

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:55.374
MATT: You're amazing, and we look forward to
meeting the new one very soon.

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:56.601
MARISHA: I love that you can't emote.

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:57.835
SAM: I can't smile.

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:01.656
TALIESIN: Just saying, they could've held the baby
five more hours. I feel like they could've done it.

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:03.167
MATT: I'm just saying, then we could've shared a
birthday.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:11.077
LIAM: It is the best day! So much is going on. My
nephew is here, so many things are happening

00:01:11.077 --> 00:01:13.325
behind the scenes. It is the best day!

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:16.299
MARISHA: It's crazy.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.003
TALIESIN: We're so tired and it's great.

00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:24.082
MATT: So anyway, let's get through our
announcements real fast. First and foremost, a big

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:30.595
thank you to our returning fantastic sponsors of
this campaign, D&amp;amp;D Beyond! Sam, if you don't mind.

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:37.903
SAM: Guys, I didn't know this. The D&amp;amp;D Beyond
discount code, 826LA, is still active for the 25%

00:01:37.903 --> 00:01:43.275
off the legendary bundle. I did not know that. It
will be expiring soon, so please make sure to

00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:48.202
check out the legendary bundle on the D&amp;amp;D Beyond
marketplace. Also, the site will be undergoing

00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:53.383
some maintenance tomorrow, Friday morning, starting
at 7:00am Pacific for a few hours. The site will

00:01:53.383 --> 00:02:00.554
be in read-only mode at this time. So, I don't
know what that means. Also, the product director

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:06.852
Adam Bradford will be hosting a stream at 9:00am
Pacific during maintenance with some exciting

00:02:06.852 --> 00:02:16.162
announcements! Be sure to tune in to
twitch.tv/dndbeyond (not and) to check it all out.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.854
And just for my little extra here tonight, not
getting lost in the fact that Travis and Laura are

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:31.036
having the most magical day of their lives and
Liam is gone, I wanted to pay special tribute to

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:37.570
our little Ashley who's leaving us for a while. I
feel like she should get some love too on her way

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:46.464
out the door. I composed a song for you in the
style of your favorite band, Boyz II Men.

00:02:46.464 --> 00:02:48.146
ASHLEY: Ah, yes!

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:49.710
TALIESIN: How did you know?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:03:00.982
SAM: (singing) How do I say goodbye... shit. To
our sweet, innocent harbinger of death fallen

00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:19.453
angel? On NBC you play a geek, but you're a real
one here with us every week. If we get to visit

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:39.462
Xhorhas, I hope Blindspot will let you play. But
until then, I hope Patterson dies every day!

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:41.472
ASHLEY: Yay!

00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:43.133
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:46.624
SAM: That's hard to do in a mustache.

00:03:46.624 --> 00:03:48.253
ASHLEY: I can see the--

00:03:48.253 --> 00:03:50.436
MARISHA: Are you committing to this all night?

00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:56.791
SAM: This is what I did the first time through the
campaign, so that's what I gotta do this time!

00:03:56.791 --> 00:04:00.607
MARISHA: Holy shit. I thought this was for your
opening gag.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:01.961
ASHLEY: Me too!

00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:05.628
SAM: This is what I wore this time in the first
campaign.

00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:07.081
MARISHA: I remember!

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:17.163
LIAM: So on this show where Ashley is about to
leave, baby Baileyham has just been born, I'm in

00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:21.993
the woods, and we're about to move, you decided to
wear that for the entire episode?

00:04:21.993 --> 00:04:25.141
SAM: I did not decide. This was put upon me by the
fates.

00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:28.351
MARISHA: You made that, though!

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.617
SAM: Yeah. I can't un-make it.

00:04:30.617 --> 00:04:32.883
MATT: Yep, it is a thing. Congratulations.

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:35.164
TALIESIN: It's been a while, is the monkey Smokey
or the Bandit? I can never remember.

00:04:35.164 --> 00:04:37.008
SAM: Oh, the monkey’s here, right? Okay, good.

00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:42.331
LIAM: As long as that is on your face, you will
get no sugar from me, Sam Riegel.

00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:46.944
MATT: No. Well, thank you very much, D&amp;amp;D Beyond.
Thank you, Sam. A couple other announcements:

00:04:46.944 --> 00:04:53.973
because we're doing this move, there will not a
Critical Role or Talks Machina next week. So we'll

00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:58.012
be missing you guys that week. We'll see you on
social media and stuff and having chats to keep us

00:04:58.012 --> 00:05:02.125
all through our withdrawal that we’ll be
suffering, and some of you I'm sure will as well.

00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:05.793
But we'll be back the week after that, the second
week of July we'll be picking up with the Talks

00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:11.870
Machina of tonight's episode, then hosted by our
fantastic Brian W. Foster. Then the following

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.194
Thursday, the following episode, in which we will
have a guest, maybe two, joining us.

00:05:17.194 --> 00:05:21.789
SAM: Oh, what? Okay. Will one of them be a baby?

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:29.002
MATT: No. I'm not that good at teaching this game.
I think language is an important barrier in

00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:30.861
teaching D&amp;amp;D.

00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:32.473
SAM: You're pretty good, though.

00:05:32.473 --> 00:05:41.812
MATT: Anyway, just so you guys are aware. Also,
for those who haven't seen on social media,

00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:44.818
welcome, we just launched a Kickstarter with our
good friends at Steamforged Games.

00:05:44.818 --> 00:05:50.422
MARISHA: Holy shit, that's right, that's also
going on! Every day feels like a year.

00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:53.993
MATT: So if you guys don't know, we launched a
Kickstarter, it's a short-form Kickstarter for our

00:05:53.993 --> 00:06:01.146
line of Vox Machina and Mighty Nein miniatures.
For those who aren't aware or familiar, we have an

00:06:01.146 --> 00:06:08.265
entire line of highly detailed, super high quality
plastic minis of all of Vox Machina including

00:06:08.265 --> 00:06:14.705
Trinket, and all of Mighty Nein. There are
stretch-- I was going to say stretch goals.

00:06:14.705 --> 00:06:21.963
There are Kickstarter exclusive rewards that
include Pumat Prime for The Mighty Nein, and his

00:06:21.963 --> 00:06:35.671
three simulacrum! As well as a fantastic Taryon
Darrington and Doty for the Vox Machina side. Go

00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:39.792
ahead and check it out, it's going to be up there
for another week or so, I believe. If you can't

00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:43.974
afford it right now, you can even put a dollar in
there and we'll have opportunities down the road

00:06:43.974 --> 00:06:48.404
hopefully for you to jump in if you missed it the
first round. But when it comes down to it, you get

00:06:48.404 --> 00:06:56.494
eight minis for Vox Machina, you get the Mighty
Nein minis as well, another eight minis, with

00:06:56.494 --> 00:07:01.913
Shakäste involved in there. All the Pumats as
well, and the extra bonus features of Tary and

00:07:01.913 --> 00:07:08.412
Doty, all for $60. Which is a pretty fantastic
package for the quality of these and for the

00:07:08.412 --> 00:07:15.412
collectable aspect of it. If you like it, help
make it happen more! It's already exploded, it's nuts.

00:07:15.412 --> 00:07:16.991
MARISHA: The boxes are looking so cool.

00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:18.247
MATT: I haven't seen the boxes yet.

00:07:18.247 --> 00:07:20.795
MARISHA: I probably shouldn't spoil that, but it's
pretty cool.

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:24.544
MATT: I should see that. We're super excited about
it. You guys have already blown it out of the

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:29.012
water. If you haven't had the opportunity, now's
the time to jump in and I hope you enjoy them. So

00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:33.028
I believe that's all the rest of the announcements
we have.

00:07:33.092 --> 00:07:34.764
MARISHA: I'm so emotional.

00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:42.077
MATT: So let's bring it in to tonight's episode of
Critical Role!

00:07:42.140 --> 00:09:03.338
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:09:03.388 --> 00:09:05.509
MATT: And welcome back.

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:07.638
TALIESIN: That was a good one.

00:09:07.638 --> 00:09:18.656
MATT: That was great. So last we left off: The
Mighty Nein, in making their way northward towards

00:09:18.656 --> 00:09:22.743
their eventual goal of Shadycreek Run to complete
their second mission that they accepted from The

00:09:22.743 --> 00:09:27.096
Gentleman in Zadash, have been traversing the
countryside and made their way to the city of

00:09:27.096 --> 00:09:33.831
Hupperdook, the largely gnomish cultural city
there of industry and currently construction of

00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:40.088
war machines to send towards the conflict with
Xhorhas to the east. There you saw the very hardy

00:09:40.088 --> 00:09:46.637
work atmosphere of the gnomes, and then the
evening very crazy party atmosphere in which many

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:55.604
of you dove into a hard drinking contest. You won
the title of the Blushing Tankard Tavern, beating

00:09:55.604 --> 00:10:00.814
out their old champions, and woke up with terrible
hangovers, and realizing that most of your gold

00:10:00.814 --> 00:10:07.946
had been stolen. Upon doing some sleuthing around
the town, you had bullied a couple of bullies that

00:10:07.946 --> 00:10:11.091
were pushing Rissa around, they had been a problem
for a while, sent them peeing their pants and

00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:18.963
rushing. You spoke with Rissa's father in his
tinkering inventor's store, in which you

00:10:18.963 --> 00:10:26.249
discovered a shiny object, a fantastic
experimental hand crossbow construct of his that

00:10:26.249 --> 00:10:31.913
he would be interested in relinquishing without
payment if you do him the favor of correcting a

00:10:31.913 --> 00:10:37.711
mistake he made a while back. Apparently he
crafted, on the request of the Starosta of the

00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:45.026
city, a powerful Gearkeeper, a construct-like
entity that was meant to help be a warden within

00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:49.367
the prison that went crazy, killed a bunch of
people and they sealed it off, and it's been there

00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:55.994
forgotten ever since. You said you'd take a look
at this. Eventually you discovered that the money

00:10:55.994 --> 00:11:01.963
you had lost had been taken by four children, who
currently are without parents, who have been

00:11:01.963 --> 00:11:07.285
living on the streets here in the city of
Hupperdook while their folks had been sent to the

00:11:07.285 --> 00:11:12.771
prison six months before for being caught
worshiping unapproved deities within the Empire.

00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:20.144
You, after having this conversation with them,
retrieving your money, and leaving Kiri with them

00:11:20.144 --> 00:11:26.072
for the time being for safekeeping, decided to see
if you had the possibility to prevent them from

00:11:26.072 --> 00:11:32.213
being sent to an Empire-run orphanage, in the
hopes of freeing their parents in some way, shape

00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:37.748
or form from their binds. That was where we had
left off.

00:11:37.748 --> 00:11:39.735
MARISHA: Where are we now? Are we still in the
butcher?

00:11:39.735 --> 00:11:44.677
MATT: You guys have stepped out of the butcher
home, leaving the kids behind with Kiri, and you

00:11:44.677 --> 00:11:50.685
are now out in the open streets of Hupperdook,
late morning, midday. What would you like to do?

00:11:50.685 --> 00:11:51.975
MARISHA: Is Rissa still there?

00:11:51.975 --> 00:11:55.198
MATT: Rissa is still with you.

00:11:55.198 --> 00:11:57.143
MARISHA: Rissa? Sorry. Okay.

00:11:57.143 --> 00:12:06.250
SAM: You said late morning? Midday? So we could at
least go check out this prison and do some

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.336
scouting before nightfall, yeah?

00:12:08.336 --> 00:12:11.069
MARISHA: We were talking about planning, and then
sleeping, and then going.

00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:13.386
TALIESIN: If we see those teenagers also, we
should probably call them off.

00:12:13.386 --> 00:12:15.997
SAM: Oh, the teenagers.

00:12:15.997 --> 00:12:25.944
MARISHA: I really would hate for our problem with
them to end up coming and finding the kids. My

00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:28.605
words aren't really here right now, you know what
I mean.

00:12:28.605 --> 00:12:30.624
SAM: Yeah, you just had a baby, I understand.

00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:33.457
MARISHA: Emotionally.

00:12:33.457 --> 00:12:42.212
LIAM: Do we want to leave it up to chance that
we'll run into those two kids, that they will not

00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:44.016
succeed, or we'll find them?

00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:47.235
TALIESIN: At the very least, we can leave word
with their employer and if we run into them, we'll

00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:48.507
call them off.

00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:50.227
MARISHA: I say we send Rissa to go talk to them.

00:12:50.227 --> 00:12:54.188
SAM: Rissa knows the town, though, she might be
able to help us scout out this prison.

00:12:54.188 --> 00:12:58.802
MARISHA: That's true. Maybe we go back to their
employer?

00:12:58.802 --> 00:13:04.536
TALIESIN: We'll have Rissa meet us at the prison
maybe later. She can call them off and we can head

00:13:04.536 --> 00:13:05.600
to the prison.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.987
SAM: Why don't we have Fjord and Jester go tell
their employers!

00:13:09.987 --> 00:13:14.424
TALIESIN: (as Fjord) "Yeah, that sounds great!"
(as Taliesin) Never mind. (as Fjord) "Yep. Well.

00:13:14.424 --> 00:13:19.506
"Great. Yep"

00:13:19.506 --> 00:13:21.901
SAM: Which one are you? Are you Jester?

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:25.860
TALIESIN: I don't know anymore. Who wants the
node, by the way?

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.429
SAM: Oh, yes. Well, let's find out if we need it
yet.

00:13:29.429 --> 00:13:33.313
MARISHA: Yeah, let's hold on to it. Maybe there's
going to be some sort of emergency situation.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.485
TALIESIN: Fair.

00:13:34.485 --> 00:13:38.085
MARISHA: Use node in case of emergency.

00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:43.174
LIAM: Jester, could we perhaps hold on to your
backpack before you go so that we have that in

00:13:43.174 --> 00:13:45.437
case we need it?

00:13:45.437 --> 00:13:47.922
MATT: "No! I am going to hold onto this. Why would
I give it to you?"

00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:55.440
LIAM: Well, I feel it is fairly obvious, but okay,
as you were.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.192
MATT: "I'm not going anywhere, why would I give it
to you? This is my bag, I paid for it."

00:13:59.192 --> 00:14:06.509
LIAM: Ja. Okay, so what are we doing now?

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:08.314
SAM: I guess we're all going.

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:15.416
MARISHA: This is revenge for any time we haven't
let Matt go on an NPC, just saying.

00:14:15.416 --> 00:14:18.384
TALIESIN: Let's go take a look at this prison.

00:14:18.384 --> 00:14:19.599
SAM: All right.

00:14:19.599 --> 00:14:24.767
MATT: Rissa goes, "All right, I can go ahead and
lead you to it. Can't say I've been too close to

00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:32.927
"it, personally, so far. Follow me." Rissa guides
you through the rest of the shelf back to the

00:14:32.927 --> 00:14:38.781
walkway that winds down the front of the mountain
to the bottom half of the city of Hupperdook.

00:14:38.781 --> 00:14:40.494
SAM: Lowerdook.

00:14:40.494 --> 00:14:42.488
MATT: Lowerdook, if you will.

00:14:42.488 --> 00:14:46.717
MARISHA: Wait, are Fjord and Jester going to go
call off the employers?

00:14:46.717 --> 00:14:53.508
MATT: They're with you guys. You can go head that
way if you want to call them off, unless you want

00:14:53.508 --> 00:14:54.928
to send them on their own wild goose chase.

00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:56.758
SAM: Fuck those guys. They'll be fine.

00:14:56.758 --> 00:15:00.515
MARISHA: I would just hate for them to find the
kids and then do something to the kids.

00:15:00.515 --> 00:15:02.099
SAM: How would they find the kids?

00:15:02.099 --> 00:15:04.101
TALIESIN: They're literally on a mission to find
the kids right now.

00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:05.404
SAM: Hmm.

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:11.424
MARISHA: I mean, we put Caleb's Alarm across it,
but still.

00:15:11.424 --> 00:15:12.410
SAM: We did.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.010
ASHLEY: Still, if they get across.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.582
MARISHA: Exactly. I don't know.

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:19.115
MATT: "I could maybe send them a message?"

00:15:19.115 --> 00:15:23.154
SAM: Oh, yes. You have that spell, don't you?

00:15:23.154 --> 00:15:24.309
MATT: "I do!"

00:15:24.309 --> 00:15:25.898
MARISHA: Can you do it to the kids?

00:15:25.898 --> 00:15:27.506
SAM: To Fitz and Ashton.

00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:28.714
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:15:28.714 --> 00:15:30.229
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Let's do that.

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.213
SAM: To Fitz.

00:15:31.213 --> 00:15:32.015
MATT: "Okay."

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:33.313
MARISHA: Man, that solves that problem.

00:15:33.313 --> 00:15:40.007
MATT: She quietly tugs on the symbol of the
Traveler and goes like, "Okay, Fitz? This is the

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:42.378
"girl with the people that were making you
angry--"

00:15:42.378 --> 00:15:44.174
SAM: You have, like, eight words left.

00:15:44.174 --> 00:15:49.139
MATT: "We... found it so..."

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:50.983
MARISHA: We don't need help.

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:53.179
MATT: "Everything is good!"

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:54.939
SAM: Go back to work.

00:15:54.939 --> 00:15:58.418
MATT: "I think that's all of it.
Go-back-to-work!"

00:15:58.418 --> 00:16:03.024
TALIESIN: Technically, "go back to work" can be
one word if you say it fast enough.

00:16:03.024 --> 00:16:05.106
SAM: That's true. A lot of that was hyphenated.

00:16:05.106 --> 00:16:08.300
MATT: "The Traveler is very forgiving."

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.009
TALIESIN: Grammar.

00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:20.290
MATT: Rissa leads you down this path to the Iron
Lot, which is-- you're guided to the basement.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:26.150
You've seen it as you approached and there was the
large platform elevator that rose up to the second

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:31.896
layer. It's currently not being used; it's locked
on the upper floor. As you head into that area,

00:16:31.896 --> 00:16:37.836
the smokestacks are billowing strongly, business
is in the process of being done full-throttle in

00:16:37.836 --> 00:16:45.605
the understanding that this coming conflict or the
now arrived conflict on the eastern side has put

00:16:45.605 --> 00:16:49.788
everyone into overdrive to prepare whatever sort
of equipment or weaponry they can send that

00:16:49.788 --> 00:16:50.769
direction.

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:55.613
SAM: And the stuff they're making is catapults or
guns?

00:16:55.613 --> 00:16:59.885
MATT: Well, from the outside, all you can see,
because you haven't been inside any of the

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:07.206
warehouses-- There is the Iron Lot and there's the
Assembly Yard. The Assembly Yard is the one that's

00:17:07.206 --> 00:17:11.416
the open space where they're building these large
siege engines. You see mobile carts that are

00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:16.295
either horse-drawn or powered by something you
don't quite understand yet that have other large

00:17:16.295 --> 00:17:17.786
weapons attached to them.

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:22.967
MARISHA: We saw bolt-throwers, those giant
bolt-throwers. Like, Lord of the Rings-style.

00:17:22.967 --> 00:17:27.641
Siege towers. Also Lord of the Rings-style.

00:17:27.641 --> 00:17:28.975
TALIESIN: Very Lord of the Rings.

00:17:28.975 --> 00:17:34.394
MARISHA: Battering ram, like every fantasy
movie-style, but definitely Lord of the Rings and

00:17:34.394 --> 00:17:35.939
the huge cannons.

00:17:35.939 --> 00:17:37.100
TALIESIN: Not very Lord of the Rings.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.059
MARISHA: Pirates.

00:17:38.059 --> 00:17:39.099
SAM: Cool.

00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:44.267
MARISHA: That's what we saw last-- or that's what
I think I saw when we did a perception check or

00:17:44.267 --> 00:17:45.274
something.

00:17:45.274 --> 00:17:46.305
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:17:46.305 --> 00:17:50.582
TALIESIN: And it looks like a big factory that
looks like a evil Willy Wonka factory kind of thing.

00:17:50.582 --> 00:17:51.483
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

00:17:51.483 --> 00:17:57.137
MATT: Yes. So as you are being led down, Rissa's
pointing out some elements of it. She goes, "Okay,

00:17:57.137 --> 00:18:03.652
"so over that side is the Omnismelter." She points
over to a cluster of a dozen or so warehouses that

00:18:03.652 --> 00:18:10.537
are scattered in a spider web-like formation that
are connected by a series of hallways between each

00:18:10.537 --> 00:18:16.006
other and then towards a central piece. She goes,
"That there is where most of the foundries of the

00:18:16.006 --> 00:18:23.056
"city lie. Where all the various mined ingots or
those imported are melted down and utilized. The

00:18:23.056 --> 00:18:32.314
"foreman there is a bit of a tool. There's the
Armavault." She points to the far northern side of

00:18:32.314 --> 00:18:39.954
the mountain base and you see a 25, 30-foot tall
by 60-foot across iron door that is solid and

00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:45.543
jammed into the side of this mountain. It looks
like it's very well protected from this glance at

00:18:45.543 --> 00:18:52.189
the distance. From what you can see, there's maybe
two dozen or so crownsguard that are stationed at

00:18:52.189 --> 00:19:02.624
its base. "That's where most of the funds that are
saved for the uses of the city maintain as well as

00:19:02.624 --> 00:19:09.396
"a number of the not currently being used devices
of war. Means of defending the city should it come

00:19:09.396 --> 00:19:16.312
"under attack, if you will." Points over there. You
can see what looks to be where most of this smoke

00:19:16.312 --> 00:19:23.698
and steam is rising from. There is this one large,
two-story black tower that has a single column of

00:19:23.698 --> 00:19:30.328
fast moving smoke pouring out of it. You can see
areas where the smoke seems to be pulsing or

00:19:30.328 --> 00:19:37.154
darkening and widening at certain places. She
goes, "That there is the Underbellows. That's

00:19:37.154 --> 00:19:43.733
"where they utilize a number of the forges and
furnaces for the factories here. They've harnessed

00:19:43.733 --> 00:19:51.957
"some of the volcanic activity beneath the mountain
and that maintains a consistent heat for the

00:19:51.957 --> 00:20:00.603
"forges. Smells downright awful, to be honest. Over
there's the Firemark Facility." She points over to

00:20:00.603 --> 00:20:05.795
a building that looks a little simpler. It's not
super tall and ominous-looking. It's very plain,

00:20:05.795 --> 00:20:14.825
made of cheap metals. You notice all the buildings
here are mostly metal, probably because there's a

00:20:14.825 --> 00:20:19.645
lot of dealing with heat, fire, sparks, and the
last thing you need is any of these things to

00:20:19.645 --> 00:20:24.278
catch fire. She points, though, to the Firemark
Facility and she goes, "This is where they're

00:20:24.278 --> 00:20:30.406
"developing a majority of certain explosive and
black powder-based technologies."

00:20:30.406 --> 00:20:33.207
SAM: What's that place called again?

00:20:33.207 --> 00:20:34.490
MATT: "It's called the Firemark Facility."

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.446
MARISHA: Firemark.

00:20:35.446 --> 00:20:36.896
SAM: Is it heavily protected?

00:20:36.896 --> 00:20:42.544
MATT: "(chuckles) Most everything is here. Then
right over there," and she points to the southern

00:20:42.544 --> 00:20:49.853
side of the mountain base of the Iron Lot to a
smaller doorway. Similar in shape and construction

00:20:49.853 --> 00:20:54.246
as to the Armavault, but it's a little more
localized. Maybe about 15-foot high and about

00:20:54.246 --> 00:21:03.786
20-foot wide. "That is the Gearhold Prison. The
one you were asking about. The one where my father

00:21:03.786 --> 00:21:05.641
"done fucked up."

00:21:05.641 --> 00:21:09.295
TALIESIN: What do you know about that machine he
built, anyway?

00:21:09.295 --> 00:21:18.785
MATT: "It's-- have you ever seen an automaton
where they're made of stone or made of clay?"

00:21:18.785 --> 00:21:20.314
TALIESIN: Come across a couple.

00:21:20.314 --> 00:21:25.727
MATT: "Imagine one that's made of metal and gears
and blades. Lots of blades."

00:21:25.727 --> 00:21:28.149
MARISHA: What? Blades?

00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:29.203
MATT: "Blades."

00:21:29.203 --> 00:21:30.535
MARISHA: Oh, god.

00:21:30.535 --> 00:21:32.336
TALIESIN: Vampire Hunters. Sorry.

00:21:32.336 --> 00:21:35.154
MATT: "It is covered in Daywalkers, yes."

00:21:35.154 --> 00:21:37.897
MARISHA: Do the blades spin?

00:21:37.897 --> 00:21:41.804
MATT: "They do. The whole thing spins, actually.
It doesn't have feet."

00:21:41.804 --> 00:21:43.714
SAM: It just rolls and cuts.

00:21:43.714 --> 00:21:44.935
MATT: "Basically."

00:21:44.935 --> 00:21:46.027
MARISHA: Oh my god.

00:21:46.027 --> 00:21:48.540
LIAM: It is animated by magical means?

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.818
MATT: "Partially magical and partially
clockwork."

00:21:51.818 --> 00:21:56.490
TALIESIN: Is it steam-powered? Or is it--

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:03.267
MATT: "The power source is magical, but most of
its actual locomotion is done through clockwork

00:22:03.267 --> 00:22:07.448
"and various internal gears. It's actually quite a
marvel to behold. It's just--"

00:22:07.448 --> 00:22:09.139
TALIESIN: It's a magical power source, then.

00:22:09.139 --> 00:22:13.397
MATT: "As far as I know. It's not my mastery. It's
my daft father's."

00:22:13.397 --> 00:22:15.160
MARISHA: So where's the source?

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.515
SAM: It's inside of it, I would assume, right?

00:22:18.515 --> 00:22:20.599
MARISHA: So if we get the source--

00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:21.877
TALIESIN: Maybe?

00:22:21.877 --> 00:22:24.235
SAM: What did your father call this "robit"?

00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:29.179
MATT: "He referred to it as the Gearkeeper."

00:22:29.179 --> 00:22:31.117
SAM: The Gearkeeper.

00:22:31.117 --> 00:22:36.198
MATT: "It was designed to be one of the
threatening wardens to help quell any sort of

00:22:36.198 --> 00:22:42.888
"breakouts of the prison. Meant as an intimidation
device for those who attempted to rise up against

00:22:42.888 --> 00:22:49.999
"their captors and possibly be its first initial
run to be a defensive sentinel for the city. If

00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:55.243
"these things worked properly, having five or six
of them just rapidly on the outskirts of the city

00:22:55.243 --> 00:23:00.750
"would probably keep anyone from trying to break in
here or make any sort of lawless act in its

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:06.245
"boundaries. Unfortunately, they've only made one
and it went crazy and killed a bunch of people. So

00:23:06.245 --> 00:23:07.312
"there's that."

00:23:07.312 --> 00:23:09.116
MARISHA: Yeah. Doesn't sound like a city I'd want
to live in.

00:23:09.116 --> 00:23:10.705
MATT: "Yeah, that's why I'm trying to fix it."

00:23:10.705 --> 00:23:11.987
MARISHA: (sighs)

00:23:11.987 --> 00:23:14.875
TALIESIN: They just let it-- they've cornered it
into a--

00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:17.789
MATT: "They sealed it off. They've been trying to
get back to it, but there's a lot of distraction

00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:20.267
"and honestly it's out of sight, out of mind, I
think."

00:23:20.267 --> 00:23:23.537
TALIESIN: Honestly, we could just show up and say
we've been hired to try and take care of it and go in.

00:23:23.537 --> 00:23:25.260
SAM: Would anyone believe that?

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.243
TALIESIN: We technically have been hired to go in
and take care of it. We're just working in trade.

00:23:29.243 --> 00:23:30.328
SAM: Not by the city.

00:23:30.328 --> 00:23:32.229
TALIESIN: No, they know not by the city, so by a
private contractor.

00:23:32.229 --> 00:23:37.087
LIAM: I am sorry, I don't understand. You say
they're too busy to deal with it. Have they got it

00:23:37.087 --> 00:23:40.532
locked away in a vault while it just stomps
around?

00:23:40.532 --> 00:23:47.015
MATT: "As far as I know, yeah. They'd originally
had it placed in the bottom floor in one section

00:23:47.015 --> 00:23:54.909
"which had more of the very violent criminals and
killed a bunch of them. Not too bad. Killed a

00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:58.932
"bunch of guards. That's pretty bad. At the time,
they didn't have the manpower to fight it off, so

00:23:58.932 --> 00:24:02.256
"they sealed the doors and haven't had a problem
since."

00:24:02.256 --> 00:24:07.997
ASHLEY: So was anyone else left in there with it?
That it maybe didn't kill or--

00:24:07.997 --> 00:24:12.702
MATT: "It's been there for quite some time. A
couple years at least, I think. Two or three

00:24:12.702 --> 00:24:17.726
"years? So if anyone was, they've expired, I'm
pretty sure. Sorry."

00:24:17.726 --> 00:24:20.294
ASHLEY: That's fine by me.

00:24:20.294 --> 00:24:22.816
SAM: Hmm.

00:24:22.816 --> 00:24:25.315
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have to do a
little more research, but I'm feeling pretty good

00:24:25.315 --> 00:24:26.431
about our prospects.

00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:31.270
SAM: Well, the main concern is getting in the
prison. I don't know if walking up to the front

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.694
door and saying, "Hi, we're here to take care of
your spinny death problem," is going to work.

00:24:35.694 --> 00:24:38.487
TALIESIN: We heard you have a bug problem. We're
here to take care of it?

00:24:38.487 --> 00:24:41.708
SAM: Do we need outfits or something?

00:24:41.708 --> 00:24:47.608
TALIESIN: I mean, I suggest we wear shoes and
pants, but you know.

00:24:47.608 --> 00:24:51.882
SAM: What, like Orkin man outfits, or do we need
to look like we're official?

00:24:51.882 --> 00:24:53.292
ASHLEY: Like a uniform of some sort?

00:24:53.292 --> 00:24:55.356
TALIESIN: We could have a letter from your father,
perhaps?

00:24:55.356 --> 00:24:56.745
MARISHA: Can we go get suits?

00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:57.814
MATT: "That's true."

00:24:57.814 --> 00:24:59.361
SAM: But they don't like her father.

00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:02.976
TALIESIN: Yeah, but they'd be perfectly happy if
we-- We're going in knowing full well what we're

00:25:02.976 --> 00:25:04.902
getting into. There's no harm, no foul there.

00:25:04.902 --> 00:25:06.156
MARISHA: Awesome black suits.

00:25:06.156 --> 00:25:11.006
LIAM: Yeah, they certainly have nothing to lose.
We are a group of people claiming we're here to

00:25:11.073 --> 00:25:14.879
deal with their issue. We either die doing it or
solve the problem.

00:25:14.879 --> 00:25:18.378
SAM: Heist-type maintenance workers uniforms?

00:25:18.378 --> 00:25:20.784
TALIESIN: Okay. You really want to break into a
prison?

00:25:20.784 --> 00:25:22.471
SAM: I just want to wear a onesie.

00:25:22.471 --> 00:25:24.853
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:24.853 --> 00:25:26.849
TALIESIN: I feel like we can make that dream come
true.

00:25:26.849 --> 00:25:31.315
MARISHA: Something with a big lapel. Maybe double
breasted. Sounds great. We would look so handsome,

00:25:31.315 --> 00:25:32.824
you guys.

00:25:32.824 --> 00:25:37.649
MATT: Jester leans in to Rissa and goes, "Rissa?
Do you have any examples of your father's writing

00:25:37.649 --> 00:25:39.667
"because I can copy it pretty well."

00:25:39.667 --> 00:25:43.700
SAM: Ooh. That sounds like something that's way
too smart for Laura to say.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.339
MARISHA: Oh.

00:25:45.339 --> 00:25:50.913
TALIESIN: You're so lucky she's not watching right
now.

00:25:50.913 --> 00:25:52.328
MATT: She'll be watching.

00:25:52.328 --> 00:25:54.004
ASHLEY: She probably is.

00:25:54.004 --> 00:25:58.449
TALIESIN: She's probably watching. Hi, Laura. I
would love to see if there's any

00:25:58.449 --> 00:26:02.098
sort of sketch or blueprint of this thing that we
could just take a look at first and maybe have a

00:26:02.098 --> 00:26:03.721
thought of our plan of attack.

00:26:03.721 --> 00:26:07.601
MATT: "I can guarantee you they're not going to
have any publicly available blueprints of a prison."

00:26:07.601 --> 00:26:09.417
TALIESIN: No, I mean of the machine.

00:26:09.417 --> 00:26:10.527
MATT: "Oh!"

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.673
MARISHA: Would your dad?

00:26:11.673 --> 00:26:12.769
MATT: "We can certainly ask."

00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:15.513
TALIESIN: Just to sort of see what we're getting
into.

00:26:15.513 --> 00:26:19.256
MATT: You see that spark in her eye of a good idea
and then thinking about having to go back to her

00:26:19.256 --> 00:26:20.410
father she's like (sighs).

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:22.117
TALIESIN: We can go on our own, if you like.

00:26:22.117 --> 00:26:28.698
MATT: "No, it's fine. I'll go. I'm used to him.
It's okay. Come on."

00:26:28.698 --> 00:26:33.393
MARISHA: Does your dad like pastries? Does he have
a sweet tooth?

00:26:33.393 --> 00:26:36.168
MATT: "I imagine he does. I've seen him eat a
few."

00:26:36.168 --> 00:26:37.391
MARISHA: Does he like pies?

00:26:37.391 --> 00:26:38.398
MATT: "Probably."

00:26:38.398 --> 00:26:40.136
MARISHA: Let's pick up your dad a pie on the way
home.

00:26:40.136 --> 00:26:41.972
MATT: "Okay."

00:26:41.972 --> 00:26:43.572
MARISHA: People like pies, right?

00:26:43.572 --> 00:26:44.722
SAM: I love a pie.

00:26:44.722 --> 00:26:47.089
TALIESIN: I mean, I like pies but I'm a bad
example of so many things.

00:26:47.089 --> 00:26:48.544
ASHLEY: I really like meat pies.

00:26:48.544 --> 00:26:52.409
MARISHA: Meat pies. Would your dad like a meat
pie? I just hear people bring pies.

00:26:52.409 --> 00:26:56.588
MATT: Fjord kind of leans in and goes, "That's
good, Jester."

00:26:56.588 --> 00:26:57.677
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:26:57.677 --> 00:26:58.532
TALIESIN: (snickers)

00:26:58.532 --> 00:27:01.953
MARISHA: Beau. But that's okay. It's been a long,
emotional day.

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:03.437
MATT: Has been.

00:27:03.437 --> 00:27:05.073
MARISHA: Hasn't it, Fjord?

00:27:05.073 --> 00:27:07.526
MATT: I have too much in my head right now, guys.
It's been a long day.

00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:09.828
SAM: Why? You playing five characters at the same
time?

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:10.878
MATT: It's fine.

00:27:10.878 --> 00:27:12.532
TALIESIN: This brings me back to some home games.

00:27:12.532 --> 00:27:14.080
MATT: Thanks, Baby Willingham.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.973
MARISHA: Oh man. So much, it's been the longest
day.

00:27:16.973 --> 00:27:18.173
MATT: It's been the longest day.

00:27:18.173 --> 00:27:20.273
LIAM: (chuckles)

00:27:20.273 --> 00:27:22.385
MARISHA: We stop and get a meat pie on the way.

00:27:22.385 --> 00:27:27.587
MATT: All right. Easy enough as you're wandering
through the street, following the scents of food

00:27:27.587 --> 00:27:32.887
that are being cooked in advance of the current
lunch hour happening. You hear a few whistles go

00:27:32.887 --> 00:27:38.066
off in the distance and in that moment, Rissa
goes, "We best be hurrying before the rush hits."

00:27:38.066 --> 00:27:45.672
And you pick up the pace as you start hearing the
different steam whistles go off and you watch a

00:27:45.672 --> 00:27:50.684
lot of the buildings begin to just swarm out with
all their workers on their brief lunch break. You

00:27:50.684 --> 00:27:56.964
manage to stay ahead of most of the wave making
their way up to the top shelf of the city,

00:27:56.964 --> 00:28:01.794
eventually coming to one of the vendors on the
outside who is swarmed by about 12 or 13 different

00:28:01.794 --> 00:28:08.825
gnomes. You wait patiently for about a good 15, 20
minutes or so as they prepare and get all their

00:28:08.825 --> 00:28:14.392
meat pies ready, sweet pies ready. Sell a few
things, a couple of their regulars cut in line in

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:19.074
front of you, not paying much attention or caring
that you're waiting patiently. But there is a

00:28:19.074 --> 00:28:22.847
large crowd behind you and you manage to get to
the front and the two gnomes that are currently in

00:28:22.847 --> 00:28:26.467
the process of divvying this up look to the
rest of you and go, "Oh, you're a right

00:28:26.467 --> 00:28:31.302
"interesting team. What brings you here? You
looking for pies? We got pies. You want pies?"

00:28:31.302 --> 00:28:34.141
SAM: We'd like a hospitable meat pie.

00:28:34.141 --> 00:28:35.789
MATT: "Single?"

00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:36.869
SAM: Oh.

00:28:36.869 --> 00:28:38.339
MATT: "It's not enough to go around, I can tell
you."

00:28:38.339 --> 00:28:39.793
ASHLEY: Well, we might need a couple.

00:28:39.793 --> 00:28:43.852
MARISHA: One for us, one for him? Two meat pie--
sorry, three meat pies!

00:28:43.852 --> 00:28:49.754
MATT: "All right!" Turns around and pulls out
three gnome-sized meat pies which are about that big.

00:28:49.754 --> 00:28:51.101
ASHLEY: Oh.

00:28:51.101 --> 00:28:52.800
MARISHA: Can we make that a double?

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.094
MATT: "Six gnomish meat pies!"

00:28:56.094 --> 00:28:57.064
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:28:57.064 --> 00:28:58.124
MATT: Passes them over.

00:28:58.124 --> 00:28:59.457
SAM: We have money again, don't we?

00:28:59.457 --> 00:29:00.616
TALIESIN: Yes, we have our money back.

00:29:00.616 --> 00:29:02.413
MARISHA: I throw down for the pies.

00:29:02.413 --> 00:29:05.513
MATT: Okay. We'll say for the total of that, it's
maybe a silver.

00:29:05.513 --> 00:29:12.825
SAM: When the whistles blew, Matthew, did we see
any guards do a shift change at the prison?

00:29:12.825 --> 00:29:17.810
MATT: Because you were rushing to get the pies,
make a perception check with disadvantage at this

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:18.941
distance.

00:29:18.941 --> 00:29:20.170
MARISHA: Mm.

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:21.095
SAM: Seven.

00:29:21.095 --> 00:29:22.569
MATT: Seven. You have no idea.

00:29:22.569 --> 00:29:24.460
MARISHA: That was super smart though.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.089
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. That's a good thought.

00:29:26.089 --> 00:29:32.614
MATT: You have your meat pies. You want to make
your way over back to the Tinkertop.

00:29:32.614 --> 00:29:38.124
MARISHA: I pass out meat pies to anyone who wants
one, but save one.

00:29:38.124 --> 00:29:43.502
MATT: All right. So you have one ready. You guys
snack as you walk along. Interesting point of

00:29:43.502 --> 00:29:52.447
noticing, as you guys come by, you do see a
familiar sight for you and for those who've been

00:29:52.447 --> 00:29:56.853
in the Empire for a bit. You're familiar with this
as well, Nott and Caleb.

00:29:56.853 --> 00:29:57.944
SAM: Oh.

00:29:57.944 --> 00:30:03.191
MATT: You see a crew. It's two crownsguard that
are flanking one figure you see wearing a black

00:30:03.191 --> 00:30:09.475
cloak with gold trim that goes just past the
shoulders. It's almost like a shawl or a um...

00:30:09.475 --> 00:30:13.895
brain escapes the term. But it's like a short
cloak.

00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:16.045
SAM: Okay.

00:30:16.045 --> 00:30:18.054
MATT: These are the tithe collectors.

00:30:18.054 --> 00:30:19.125
SAM: Oh, yes.

00:30:19.125 --> 00:30:20.758
MARISHA: Taxman.

00:30:20.758 --> 00:30:27.933
MATT: They're referred to colloquially as Reapers
behind their back, but you see them exiting one

00:30:27.933 --> 00:30:30.308
home and moving onto the next door and knocking.

00:30:30.308 --> 00:30:33.223
MARISHA: Are they heading towards the butcher?

00:30:33.223 --> 00:30:38.265
MATT: A ways away, but they're present. It seems
that the time of year has come, the

00:30:38.265 --> 00:30:46.751
every-six-month window seems to be coming or has
arrived. Nevertheless, you travel with meat pie in

00:30:46.751 --> 00:30:53.049
hand, eventually making your way back to Tinkertop
Inventions, the door still partially ajar. You see

00:30:53.049 --> 00:30:57.503
the faint light of the two lanterns in the back as
you enter, and there in the back you see, in the process

00:30:57.503 --> 00:31:05.775
of sketching something down, your good friend,
Mastermaker Cleff Tinkertop. "Ah, you've returned!

00:31:05.788 --> 00:31:09.217
"Certainly good to see you! What can I help you
with?"

00:31:09.217 --> 00:31:10.755
SAM: We've brought gift.

00:31:10.755 --> 00:31:15.639
MATT: "Oh, that's so kind! Thank you so much!"

00:31:15.689 --> 00:31:17.313
MARISHA: It was Rissa's idea.

00:31:17.313 --> 00:31:25.366
MATT: "Rissa, for your old pops, did you?" She's
like, "Well, it was sort of a group decision. Hope

00:31:25.366 --> 00:31:38.805
"you like it, Dad." "It's cold, but tasty. Anyway."
He takes it and starts eating it, stuffing it in

00:31:38.805 --> 00:31:46.497
chunks through his gnomish maw, getting bits of
the gravy dripping off of the chin.

00:31:46.497 --> 00:31:51.392
TALIESIN: We're going to take a stab at this death
machine. We were curious if you could--

00:31:51.392 --> 00:31:54.043
MARISHA: I love that that's what we're calling
it.

00:31:54.043 --> 00:31:56.415
TALIESIN: I like the description.

00:31:56.415 --> 00:31:57.989
MARISHA: Spinning death machine.

00:31:57.989 --> 00:32:01.039
TALIESIN: If there's any information you can give
us about the machine, just so that we're not going

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:04.488
in cold, like if you know if it has any
vulnerabilities to anything.

00:32:04.488 --> 00:32:06.739
MATT: "Plenty! I built the thing myself. Don't
worry!"

00:32:06.739 --> 00:32:08.667
TALIESIN: If you can sketch it for us so we can
get a sense of--

00:32:08.667 --> 00:32:14.409
MATT: "Oh, I've already got it. Don't worry there,
friend. I'll be right back!" Turns around and

00:32:14.409 --> 00:32:16.183
disappears behind a--

00:32:16.183 --> 00:32:20.251
SAM: We could steal the crossbow. We don't have to
do the mission at all.

00:32:20.251 --> 00:32:22.236
TALIESIN: Please don't tell me that you're going
to do that.

00:32:22.236 --> 00:32:23.758
SAM: I could, just saying.

00:32:23.758 --> 00:32:29.036
MATT: You hear some rustling and some things
falling over. A couple of banging noises, and then

00:32:29.036 --> 00:32:33.678
you hear a (clattering), "Damn it."

00:32:33.678 --> 00:32:35.647
SAM: Is that a cymbal crashing?

00:32:35.647 --> 00:32:39.430
LIAM: Being as the man's daughter is standing
here with us, perhaps we will pass on that idea.

00:32:39.487 --> 00:32:44.139
MATT: "Yeah, I can hear you, just so you're aware.
I'm right next to you, little one."

00:32:44.139 --> 00:32:47.173
SAM: She's clever.

00:32:47.173 --> 00:32:49.814
MARISHA: No, she just has hearing.

00:32:49.814 --> 00:32:52.515
SAM: No. She's a wily one.

00:32:52.515 --> 00:33:02.562
MATT: A moment later, Cleff returns, clutching an
armful of rolled pieces of paper and prints and

00:33:02.562 --> 00:33:07.895
parchment and goes, "Here's about everything I've
got on the thing." Throws it down in front of you,

00:33:07.895 --> 00:33:14.180
some of it unrolls. There's various stages of
design, the breakdown of the mechanics and the

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:21.359
interior of this. It's extremely intricate and
very impressive clockwork. Roll an intelligence check.

00:33:21.359 --> 00:33:23.653
TALIESIN: Okay, but I'm not going to be able
to make heads or tails of any of this shit.

00:33:23.705 --> 00:33:25.884
LIAM: Yes, I have questions about it as well.

00:33:25.884 --> 00:33:27.018
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:33:27.018 --> 00:33:34.888
MATT: Caleb, you are the one who is the most
proficient with understanding systems. If you

00:33:34.888 --> 00:33:39.056
could make an intelligence check for me as well,
both you and Molly, since Molly was the first to

00:33:39.056 --> 00:33:40.681
grab them.

00:33:40.681 --> 00:33:42.273
LIAM: Oh. Natural one.

00:33:42.273 --> 00:33:44.613
MARISHA: Oh no-sies!

00:33:44.613 --> 00:33:47.955
SAM: He's eating that extra meat pie.

00:33:47.955 --> 00:33:49.308
TALIESIN: Eight.

00:33:49.308 --> 00:33:52.537
MATT: You both take a moment and look over it.
One, it's all written in Gnomish. Do either of

00:33:52.537 --> 00:33:54.515
you guys understand Gnomish as a language?

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.143
TALIESIN: Does anybody understand Gnomish?

00:33:56.143 --> 00:33:59.900
SAM: Gnome.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:07.718
MATT: Secondly, a lot of the blueprints are in
shorthand, and the design work-- while it's very

00:34:07.718 --> 00:34:12.858
beautiful to see-- the actual sketching of each
stage of its construction and the interior

00:34:12.858 --> 00:34:18.899
mechanisms about it are very beautiful, it is very
intricate. Paying attention to it and looking it

00:34:18.899 --> 00:34:24.469
over, the best you can ascertain is there is a
core. There is some sort of a device that powers

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:29.811
it. Through the notes around it, it's supposed to
power for about 200 years before it needs

00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:30.932
replacing.

00:34:30.932 --> 00:34:33.302
SAM: Just wait it out.

00:34:33.302 --> 00:34:35.176
LIAM: It's a good half-life.

00:34:35.176 --> 00:34:38.406
MARISHA: It's a Duracell.

00:34:38.406 --> 00:34:45.503
MATT: However, around it is layer after layer of
metallic iron rings that are joined at certain

00:34:45.503 --> 00:34:48.855
hinge points so they can spin and shift in the
inside like a gyroscope.

00:34:48.855 --> 00:34:50.847
TALIESIN: It's very hard to get a spell in there.

00:34:50.847 --> 00:34:55.135
MATT: Yes. It's not impossible if you pull enough
of the armor away, which is the next stage, the

00:34:55.135 --> 00:35:00.404
layers of armor. There's three different layers of
articulated armor that can shift and move because

00:35:00.404 --> 00:35:06.876
on the inside there are about a dozen bladed arms
that, at any given point in time, can fold out of

00:35:06.876 --> 00:35:11.515
the armor and strike like small scythes or sickles
and then retract inside.

00:35:11.515 --> 00:35:15.889
SAM: You are fucking crazy, Cleff!

00:35:15.889 --> 00:35:19.099
MATT: "That's certainly not the first time I've
heard that!"

00:35:19.099 --> 00:35:28.483
LIAM: Yeah, so Herr Tinkertop, once we are to
get past these defenses, would dispelling its

00:35:28.483 --> 00:35:31.747
arcane nature shut the machine down?

00:35:31.747 --> 00:35:40.376
MATT: "I mean, that's possible. Oh, curses! I
should've thought of some way of a fail-safe to

00:35:40.376 --> 00:35:45.486
"prevent that from happening. Well, next design!
Next design, it'll be dispel-proof. Thank you for

00:35:45.486 --> 00:35:47.245
"that! You're a good--"

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:51.709
LIAM: The nutshell protecting that core needs to
be defeated first?

00:35:51.709 --> 00:35:59.046
MATT: "I imagine to a certain extent. There is a
base level of insulation from impactful or various

00:35:59.046 --> 00:36:05.407
"magical intrusions that could affect the core,
that I did think of. But there's only really one.

00:36:05.407 --> 00:36:07.646
"I should've put three."

00:36:07.646 --> 00:36:09.495
TALIESIN: We start pulling plates off--

00:36:09.495 --> 00:36:11.248
MATT: He starts making notes feverishly.

00:36:11.248 --> 00:36:14.136
TALIESIN: -- start cutting our way through one
specific spot, we could eventually get to a point

00:36:14.136 --> 00:36:15.760
where you could get some spells in there.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.472
SAM: Or maybe Yasha could hit it with her sword.

00:36:18.472 --> 00:36:20.239
TALIESIN: You may have to tank this.

00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:24.851
ASHLEY: I will certainly try, this does seem like
a very--

00:36:24.851 --> 00:36:28.701
TALIESIN: Is there a front and back to this thing,
or is it just a whirling dervish?

00:36:28.701 --> 00:36:39.611
MATT: "The front and back is--" Dervish! That's a
great pirate word, dervish! He looks to you and

00:36:39.611 --> 00:36:46.370
goes, "There is, kind of." He goes through one of
the papers and pulls it open and there are plates

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:53.601
of the armor-- certain plates that fold up from
the inside. They open and there is a small lens,

00:36:53.601 --> 00:36:59.943
like a crystal-type lens, that recesses on the
inside when it's moving and then seems to push out

00:36:59.943 --> 00:37:01.317
from it to see.

00:37:01.317 --> 00:37:03.066
MARISHA: Okay.

00:37:03.066 --> 00:37:07.347
SAM: Question. Can it climb?

00:37:07.347 --> 00:37:18.655
MATT: "Depending on the terrain, probably. If it's
flat-walled surfaces, it's not designed for

00:37:18.655 --> 00:37:24.424
"climbing. It's designed for intimidation and
slaughtering. Perhaps my design was a bit

00:37:24.424 --> 00:37:30.465
"unfocused for the reason they asked me to build
it, but, ah! Next time. Climbing? I don't know,

00:37:30.465 --> 00:37:31.622
"probably not."

00:37:31.622 --> 00:37:34.916
LIAM: And does it have any capabilities of
attacking at range?

00:37:34.916 --> 00:37:39.485
MATT: "As far as I know, no, but it moves very
fast."

00:37:39.485 --> 00:37:47.607
MARISHA: These lenses, I'm assuming they're
regular lenses? I don't know, they can still be

00:37:47.607 --> 00:37:48.813
blinded, right?

00:37:48.813 --> 00:37:56.272
MATT: "Maybe. They're made of a very thick
crystalline substance that had to be imported from

00:37:56.272 --> 00:38:03.381
"up north from the remnants of one of the old elven
societies there that specialized in making strong

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:04.375
"crystal."

00:38:04.375 --> 00:38:08.747
MARISHA: So it's super cheap and easy to break.
Imported. Great.

00:38:08.747 --> 00:38:16.755
TALIESIN: It could possibly be blinded by
obscuring the lens?

00:38:16.755 --> 00:38:18.360
MATT: "Maybe."

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:21.909
MARISHA: I was going to say, if we can get
something to blind it, it's still just a lens.

00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:26.480
MATT: Starts writing down more notes. "Make sure
lens can't be obscured in a future design."

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.974
SAM: Cleff, when you were building this thing, you
were building it off-site I assume, right?

00:38:31.974 --> 00:38:33.228
MATT: "No, I built it here!"

00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:36.255
SAM: No, I mean off the prison site, not--

00:38:36.255 --> 00:38:37.321
MATT: "Oh, right."

00:38:37.321 --> 00:38:41.769
SAM: So you don't know any extra secret entrances
or exits to the prison itself?

00:38:41.769 --> 00:38:47.397
MATT: "No, unfortunately, they keep us away from
all of that for security reasons. So I couldn't

00:38:47.397 --> 00:38:54.572
"help people break in or out. Like now.
That would've been very helpful. Sorry."

00:38:54.627 --> 00:38:59.517
LIAM: Would it be foolish to have you speak on our
behalf to usher us in?

00:38:59.517 --> 00:39:04.359
MATT: "I don't think they're going to let me in."

00:39:04.359 --> 00:39:10.354
TALIESIN: Not you in per se, but if we show up as
representatives here to dismantle the machine?

00:39:10.354 --> 00:39:13.350
LIAM: Yes, you're finally ready to make amends, et
cetera.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.114
TALIESIN: And you hired us to go in and do some
work.

00:39:16.114 --> 00:39:23.591
MATT: "Maybe." He looks at Rissa. "Rissa, would
you mind bringing your old pops with you?" She's

00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:32.768
like, "Only to the door, Dad, then you can come
back." She glares over the two of you. "If that's

00:39:32.768 --> 00:39:34.242
"necessary."

00:39:34.242 --> 00:39:36.219
TALIESIN: Whatever works.

00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:42.455
MATT: "Fine, come along, then. We'll close up
behind, get your keys." "Oh, I haven't been down

00:39:42.455 --> 00:39:47.021
"for a proper walk with friends in some time, I'm
so excited!"

00:39:47.021 --> 00:39:50.956
TALIESIN: We should get some honey or something. I
bet some honey on the lens would be a real pain in

00:39:50.956 --> 00:39:52.152
the ass.

00:39:52.152 --> 00:39:54.295
MATT: He takes the last bit of meat pie and shoves
it in his mouth real fast.

00:39:54.295 --> 00:39:55.485
TALIESIN: Do you have any honey?

00:39:55.485 --> 00:39:56.717
MATT: (unintelligible shouting)

00:39:56.717 --> 00:39:58.352
LIAM: I have honey.

00:39:58.352 --> 00:39:59.654
TALIESIN: Of course you do.

00:39:59.654 --> 00:40:00.968
LIAM: Yeah.

00:40:00.968 --> 00:40:10.397
MARISHA: Why not something darker? Like ash,
charcoal, black powder.

00:40:10.397 --> 00:40:12.649
LIAM: I have that as well.

00:40:12.649 --> 00:40:15.467
TALIESIN: What do you have?

00:40:15.467 --> 00:40:17.393
LIAM: I have molasses.

00:40:17.393 --> 00:40:19.768
MARISHA: That is darker.

00:40:19.768 --> 00:40:25.163
TALIESIN: Why do you have molasses? This is
suddenly very exciting.

00:40:25.163 --> 00:40:32.327
LIAM: I will tell you that in a few minutes,
actually, if that's all right.

00:40:32.327 --> 00:40:36.110
MATT: Jester goes, "This entire time you've been
holding out on delicious molasses?"

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:41.759
LIAM: It's industrial grade, it is not for
baking.

00:40:41.759 --> 00:40:45.099
MATT: "Are you sure?"

00:40:45.099 --> 00:40:48.369
LIAM: I am quite sure. Did I stutter?

00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:53.659
TALIESIN: Is this why your skin is so smooth?
You've been giving yourself a facial every night.

00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:56.319
ASHLEY: Wait, what's the difference between baking
and industrial grade?

00:40:56.319 --> 00:41:09.480
LIAM: That is a good question, Yasha. I don't cook
with it, I use it for arcane things.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.531
TALIESIN: Magic molasses.

00:41:11.531 --> 00:41:15.688
MARISHA: Actually, this brings up a-- how much
molasses do you have?

00:41:15.688 --> 00:41:17.461
MATT: (as Fjord) "Yeah, how much you carrying?"

00:41:17.461 --> 00:41:21.009
MARISHA: That's so weird. It’s so abrasive
sometimes.

00:41:21.009 --> 00:41:25.888
LIAM: I have about the amount of a plum, wrapped
in--

00:41:25.888 --> 00:41:27.728
SAM: That's enough to smear a lens.

00:41:27.728 --> 00:41:31.410
TALIESIN: I was thinking if we had a small glass
jar of it, we could give it a throw.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:34.656
ASHLEY: We could also put a meat pie in the--

00:41:34.656 --> 00:41:38.910
SAM: I could put a meat pie on the end of one of
my bolts and shoot it at it.

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.745
MATT: (as Fjord) "Pie-chucker."

00:41:40.745 --> 00:41:45.069
MARISHA: I feel like molasses would gum up
something that's clockwork, right?

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:48.281
TALIESIN: It could help, it depends on how strong
the clockwork is.

00:41:48.281 --> 00:41:50.622
SAM: Or just tar or something.

00:41:50.622 --> 00:41:51.659
MARISHA: Yeah, something sticky.

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:52.690
TALIESIN: Bubble gum.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:56.222
LIAM: That would be even better, if we could get our
hands on--

00:41:56.222 --> 00:42:00.839
SAM: Maybe on the walk, we can see if we can find
a tar restaurant.

00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:11.095
MATT: Rissa goes, "I mean, tar is not uncommonly
used in some of the industrial districts down in

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:12.189
"the Iron Lot."

00:42:12.189 --> 00:42:16.970
TALIESIN: And we do have some friends over there
that we just sent their young interns away on a--

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:21.374
MATT: "Well, the forge masters, they're mainly in
metalwork. As far as tar use, that's going to be

00:42:21.374 --> 00:42:26.245
"down in the Iron Lot, and that's going to be--
you're on your own there."

00:42:26.245 --> 00:42:27.884
MARISHA: I mean, how do we transport it?

00:42:27.884 --> 00:42:29.153
SAM: In a bucket?

00:42:29.153 --> 00:42:30.633
TALIESIN: In a very gentle bucket or pot.

00:42:30.633 --> 00:42:33.817
MARISHA: Heated tar? In a bucket?

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:35.239
TALIESIN: It doesn't have to be hot. It just has
to be--

00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:36.535
SAM: It has to be a little hot.

00:42:36.535 --> 00:42:37.645
TALIESIN: Has to be a little hot.

00:42:37.645 --> 00:42:40.086
MARISHA: Yeah, it gets hard. It's tar.

00:42:40.086 --> 00:42:44.515
MATT: Fjord goes, "If only we knew someone around
here who is pretty decent with fire."

00:42:44.515 --> 00:42:53.081
SAM: Hey, you could heat up a bucket of tar as we
walk into a prison. That wouldn't be suspicious at all!

00:42:53.081 --> 00:42:58.532
MARISHA: Once we get down! Once we get down!

00:42:58.532 --> 00:43:07.000
LIAM: That is a good idea, Fjord. Also, Fjord,
congratulations on this, your most auspicious day.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.085
MATT: "Why thank you. I appreciate you being so
forthright and appreciative, Caleb."

00:43:14.085 --> 00:43:22.370
LIAM: Yeah. Get your sleep while you can, and
don't use the exercise ball to rock him to sleep

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:26.294
because then they get addicted to it, and that's
the end of your sleep life yourself.

00:43:26.294 --> 00:43:29.021
MATT: "I have no idea what the hell you're talking
about."

00:43:29.021 --> 00:43:34.953
ASHLEY: Did you babysit a lot as a kid, Caleb? Is
this how you know so much?

00:43:34.953 --> 00:43:36.304
LIAM: Oh, no.

00:43:36.304 --> 00:43:38.000
TALIESIN: There's so many walls being broken.
There's like fourth wall, fifth wall, sixth wall.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.193
It's too deep.

00:43:39.193 --> 00:43:41.800
MATT: You just broke the Prismatic Wall.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.365
TALIESIN: We’re in the eleventh dimension now.
This is getting a little heavy.

00:43:45.365 --> 00:43:52.526
MARISHA: He totally just took a thank you for not
his baby being born!

00:43:52.526 --> 00:43:54.332
SAM: This is the worst night ever!

00:43:54.332 --> 00:43:55.881
TALIESIN: Can I remove that?

00:43:55.881 --> 00:43:57.475
ASHLEY: Please take it off!

00:43:57.475 --> 00:43:58.701
SAM: No! I’m committed!

00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:03.671
MARISHA: I feel like at break time last time, it
came off.

00:44:03.671 --> 00:44:04.635
LIAM: Yeah.

00:44:04.635 --> 00:44:06.027
MARISHA: You made it to break, I think.

00:44:06.027 --> 00:44:08.924
SAM: I've got two spares if I need it!

00:44:08.924 --> 00:44:10.465
MARISHA, ASHLEY, and TALIESIN: No!

00:44:10.465 --> 00:44:16.902
MARISHA: Don't do this to yourself.

00:44:16.902 --> 00:44:22.649
MATT: At this point, as you guys are having this
awkward conversation, Cleff is rushing around

00:44:22.649 --> 00:44:27.382
grabbing a coat and grabbing some other things,
filling the inside of his apron with various tools

00:44:27.382 --> 00:44:33.231
and utensils, "Oh, I can probably use that. All
right, I think I'm ready to come with you."

00:44:33.231 --> 00:44:34.381
SAM: Let's go.

00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:44.053
MATT: You all step outside, and you get about 30
or so feet before you see Cleff’s pace is slowing.

00:44:44.053 --> 00:44:49.073
He takes another step and keeps looking around.

00:44:49.073 --> 00:44:52.143
MARISHA: When was the last time you left your
house, Cleff?

00:44:52.143 --> 00:45:03.521
MATT: "It's been a while. It's starting to get a
little warm." Rissa is like, "He's kind of a--

00:45:03.521 --> 00:45:05.367
"what's the term?"

00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:06.728
MARISHA: Agoraphobic.

00:45:06.728 --> 00:45:10.750
MATT: "Agoraphobic, if you will. He's a bit iffy
on the outside. Are you sure you're all right,

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:15.882
Dad? You can still stay." "No, no, it's fine. I
want to hang out with my friends here. (nervous laugh)"

00:45:15.882 --> 00:45:18.613
SAM: Do you need a drink to soothe your nerves?

00:45:18.613 --> 00:45:23.200
MATT: "I don't-- I've never had a drink. I don't
need a drink, but thank you."

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.650
SAM: But it would really help.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:25.761
MATT: "Well I--" and looks over.

00:45:25.761 --> 00:45:27.388
TALIESIN: How about just a huddle up? Huddle up,
let's just--

00:45:27.388 --> 00:45:28.773
MARISHA: Just us?

00:45:28.773 --> 00:45:31.738
TALIESIN: No, we can put him in the center.

00:45:31.738 --> 00:45:35.485
MARISHA: Huddle around him, okay. We perform a
protective--

00:45:35.485 --> 00:45:41.535
MATT: You all get really close to him. He's like,
"Oh, this is really warm. This is a lot of attention."

00:45:41.535 --> 00:45:45.738
MARISHA: No, not that close. We're making a safety
bubble.

00:45:45.738 --> 00:45:47.316
MATT: "Oh, all right."

00:45:47.316 --> 00:45:49.571
TALIESIN: I mean, it could be warm.

00:45:49.571 --> 00:45:55.529
LIAM: This is silly. I take off the cloak that
I've been wearing for a week or so now, and I just

00:45:55.529 --> 00:45:57.336
put it over the man's head.

00:45:57.336 --> 00:45:58.730
MATT: (muffled yelp)

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.043
LIAM: No, oh, sorry.

00:46:01.043 --> 00:46:05.058
SAM and MATT: In a comforting way.

00:46:05.058 --> 00:46:06.323
(laughter)

00:46:06.323 --> 00:46:07.734
LIAM: To disguise his appearance.

00:46:07.734 --> 00:46:09.034
SAM: In a smothering way.

00:46:09.034 --> 00:46:20.102
MATT: He takes it and pulls it over his head. "All
right," and he, "Let's go (nervous chuckle)." And

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:25.045
is like, "One step, two step." He's basically Bill
Murray in What About Bob? at this point. He's

00:46:25.045 --> 00:46:29.970
concentrating on each step he makes going
forward. It's slowing you down a little bit, but

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:36.609
he's making it forward. Rissa is like,
(exasperated groan). You eventually make your way,

00:46:36.609 --> 00:46:39.143
further and further.

00:46:39.143 --> 00:46:43.054
SAM: We're just going to walk up to the guards and
say we're here to dismantle the "robit," right?

00:46:43.054 --> 00:46:45.146
TALIESIN: We are professional robot dismantlers.

00:46:45.146 --> 00:46:48.334
SAM: All right, let's do it. Who's going to be
doing the talking?

00:46:48.334 --> 00:46:53.948
TALIESIN: Well, we're going to stop and pick up
some tar on the way there and-- I nominate the

00:46:53.948 --> 00:46:55.650
human to talk.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.267
MARISHA: Ah, I can't nominate Fjord?

00:46:58.267 --> 00:47:02.817
SAM: Yeah. Yeah, no, I think Fjord would agree
with that.

00:47:02.817 --> 00:47:05.437
MARISHA: Do you believe in me, Fjord?

00:47:05.437 --> 00:47:12.313
MATT: "You know, if I have learned anything it is
that you are full of surprises. So by all means."

00:47:12.313 --> 00:47:15.011
MARISHA: All right, tar first.

00:47:15.011 --> 00:47:19.180
SAM: Tar first. Where do we go for tar, the Iron
Lot?

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:25.160
MATT: Rissa looks. "Iron Lot's most likely. I'll
keep an eye out, follow me." She leads you guys

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:30.608
down the switchback path, once more down to the
Iron Lot, the bottom shelf of the city. There,

00:47:30.608 --> 00:47:38.911
upon keeping an eye out, Rissa is looking back and
forth. On the outskirts of the Firemark Facility

00:47:38.911 --> 00:47:44.723
she's like, "No, I don't think they're going to do
much as far as tar goes. Honestly, a lot of it's

00:47:44.723 --> 00:47:53.160
"probably based somewhere in the Assembly Yard.
That's where they're making the bigger constructs

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.317
"and having to piece together wood exteriors."

00:47:55.317 --> 00:47:56.566
MARISHA: Is that far from here?

00:47:56.566 --> 00:48:01.782
MATT: "No, it's on the northern side of the bottom
shelf." She leads you guys over to the outskirts,

00:48:01.782 --> 00:48:07.169
and there is a big fence that wraps around the
Assembly Yard, where a lot of these thin standing,

00:48:07.169 --> 00:48:12.537
skeletal towers of metal are placed against some
constructs that are in partial levels of

00:48:12.537 --> 00:48:16.500
construction. Others are empty and not currently
in use. Other ones seem to have been near

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:21.132
completion, and they're in the process of
preparing and breaking down the various siege

00:48:21.132 --> 00:48:27.341
engine for transport to the east. Who's keeping an
eye out to see if there’s anything that could be

00:48:27.341 --> 00:48:29.911
used like tar? Who's looking for this?

00:48:29.911 --> 00:48:31.250
SAM: I'll look for that.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.130
MATT: All right, make a perception check, please.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.820
SAM: 18.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:42.852
MATT: 18, not too bad. You take about five minutes
or so to case the vicinity, and looking between

00:48:42.852 --> 00:48:53.015
the gate, you can see, two towers over, there is one
partially constructed, wide bolt-thrower cart that

00:48:53.015 --> 00:48:57.902
only has one that's currently bolted to it. You see that
they're taking leather elements and tarring them

00:48:57.902 --> 00:49:03.445
around the edges to prevent any sort of impacts
from splintering the wood that's carrying it. It

00:49:03.445 --> 00:49:07.672
looks like from there, they go with a leather case
and put metal over that and bolt it down. But in

00:49:07.672 --> 00:49:13.074
the process they do have what looks to be a couple
of small pails that have some thick, black,

00:49:13.074 --> 00:49:18.495
tar-like substance that they're putting around the
edges.

00:49:18.495 --> 00:49:21.273
SAM: And we're behind a gate? And there's
workers everywhere?

00:49:21.273 --> 00:49:26.884
MATT: There's probably, within current view of the
open portion of this side of the Assembly Yard,

00:49:26.884 --> 00:49:31.756
about 20 or so workers that are in the middle of
focusing on their work at hand. But it's in an

00:49:31.756 --> 00:49:38.825
open space, with maybe 20 to 30 feet open between
each project tower. So, it's pretty open. You'd

00:49:38.825 --> 00:49:40.611
have to be creative.

00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:42.180
SAM: This is at the Assembly Yard?

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.128
MATT: Correct.

00:49:43.128 --> 00:49:49.396
MARISHA: I take my staff out. And I go (vibrating
ring) across the gate.

00:49:49.396 --> 00:49:50.863
SAM: Ah, why would you-- no.

00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:57.980
MATT: As you do so, (vibrating ring) across it,
Rissa goes, "Ah!" And you look at the nearby

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:03.241
tower, maybe 25 or 30 feet ahead to the north of
you, one of the gnomes at the top of the tower is

00:50:03.241 --> 00:50:07.923
currently hammering away at one of the large
constructs, siege tower-like structures. Looks

00:50:07.923 --> 00:50:11.517
over, pulls the goggles up, "Hello?"

00:50:11.517 --> 00:50:15.711
MARISHA: Good money or trade for some supplies!

00:50:15.711 --> 00:50:21.828
MATT: "Piss off." Puts the goggles down.
(hammering)

00:50:21.828 --> 00:50:27.429
SAM: We could just walk in and pretend to be a
worker and just grab a bucket.

00:50:27.429 --> 00:50:30.663
MARISHA: I thought we're behind a gate, like
locked out.

00:50:30.663 --> 00:50:31.950
SAM: We could just sneak in the gate.

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:32.929
MARISHA: Just sneak in?

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:42.162
LIAM: I have an idea. I could summon Schmidt, and
it would be a slow process, but he could carry it

00:50:42.162 --> 00:50:48.698
a couple of inches, low to the ground, and wait,
and then go a couple of feet.

00:50:48.698 --> 00:50:50.469
SAM: What's his range?

00:50:50.469 --> 00:50:53.801
LIAM: Oh, let's see.

00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:55.663
SAM: How far is it, Matt?

00:50:55.663 --> 00:51:02.542
MATT: The nearest-- the one little part of the
yard that they're currently using this material is

00:51:02.542 --> 00:51:07.735
about 60 feet away from you. 60 to 70 from your
immediate guess at a glance.

00:51:07.735 --> 00:51:10.512
LIAM: Oh, it is about that distance.

00:51:10.512 --> 00:51:12.687
MATT: Okay.

00:51:12.687 --> 00:51:18.442
LIAM: So it might be just shy or-- let's give it a
whirl. Just give me ten-ish minutes.

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:20.381
SAM: Ten minutes!? Oh, okay.

00:51:20.381 --> 00:51:25.916
LIAM: That's not bad. I pull a book out of my
holster and flip to the right page and start

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:32.015
muttering. Does anyone want to do anything in
those nine minutes left?

00:51:32.015 --> 00:51:37.685
SAM: I'll walk around and see if there's a way
through the gate that's hidden.

00:51:37.685 --> 00:51:39.455
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:51:39.455 --> 00:51:42.966
TALIESIN: I'll keep an eye on the guard-- not on the
guard, I'll keep an eye on the worker.

00:51:42.966 --> 00:51:44.238
SAM: Ten.

00:51:44.238 --> 00:51:48.776
MATT: Ten. You take the ten minutes to look
through, but this part of the gate is pretty

00:51:48.776 --> 00:51:55.295
solidly locked in. It's about six and a half,
seven feet tall, and it's just metal bars with

00:51:55.295 --> 00:52:05.369
almost a cross-lattice of even thinner metal
strips that are about a quarter-inch thick. The

00:52:05.369 --> 00:52:08.919
openings are about that big, so you can still see
through like portholes, but it's not quite large

00:52:08.919 --> 00:52:13.543
enough for most of you to slip through. You might
be able to if you're careful and squeeze, since

00:52:13.543 --> 00:52:14.889
you're small enough.

00:52:14.889 --> 00:52:18.278
MARISHA: And they’re mainly gnomes working this--

00:52:18.278 --> 00:52:25.507
MATT: Gnomes, and you see a handful of dwarves,
but the dwarves seem to be mostly doing oversight,

00:52:25.507 --> 00:52:26.486
supervision.

00:52:26.486 --> 00:52:31.885
MARISHA: Okay. So I like, as a plan B, you
disguising yourself as a gnome worker.

00:52:31.885 --> 00:52:34.287
SAM: Okay, let's see if Schmidt can--

00:52:34.287 --> 00:52:35.716
MARISHA: Do it first?

00:52:35.716 --> 00:52:43.517
MATT: So you complete your spell ritual. You
summon your Unseen Servant.

00:52:43.517 --> 00:52:50.665
LIAM: Ja. Schmidt, one second. You two, circus
people. Mollymauk.

00:52:50.665 --> 00:52:52.109
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:52.109 --> 00:53:00.268
LIAM: Could-- ah, that's cute. Could the two of
you do something fabulous over there?

00:53:00.268 --> 00:53:01.796
ASHLEY: Make a distraction?

00:53:01.796 --> 00:53:02.987
LIAM: Ja.

00:53:02.987 --> 00:53:04.646
SAM: Juggle something?

00:53:04.646 --> 00:53:12.703
ASHLEY: Yeah, I could have you stand on my
shoulders.

00:53:12.703 --> 00:53:15.925
TALIESIN: We could do that thing. Do you remember
the vaulty thing? Let's do the vaulting thing. All

00:53:15.925 --> 00:53:17.558
right, you're going to do the thing over the--
vault up.

00:53:17.558 --> 00:53:20.010
ASHLEY: Okay. Ready?

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:24.358
MATT: At which point, Cleff goes, "Oh! We're going
to see a performance."

00:53:24.358 --> 00:53:26.538
ASHLEY: Yeah. Get ready--

00:53:26.538 --> 00:53:30.062
LIAM: I preemptively send Schmidt over to the
closest bucket.

00:53:30.062 --> 00:53:34.865
MATT: And the range on that is-- It cannot get
more than 60 feet than you, right?

00:53:34.865 --> 00:53:36.374
LIAM: Ja, that is correct.

00:53:36.374 --> 00:53:40.224
MATT: Okay. So, what are the two of you doing?

00:53:40.224 --> 00:53:42.989
TALIESIN: If you get near the fence, I'm going to
try and jump on top of the fence.

00:53:42.989 --> 00:53:44.622
ASHLEY: Great.

00:53:44.622 --> 00:53:46.555
TALIESIN: All right, we're going to need the
(mumbling).

00:53:46.555 --> 00:53:49.371
SAM: Wait, you're going to jump the fence? No,
this is a distraction. You're not supposed to jump

00:53:49.371 --> 00:53:50.387
in the--

00:53:50.387 --> 00:53:51.465
TALIESIN: I'm going to jump on top of the fence.

00:53:51.465 --> 00:53:52.497
SAM: Oh god.

00:53:52.497 --> 00:53:54.561
ASHLEY: Are you going to go in or are you just
going--

00:53:54.561 --> 00:53:56.340
TALIESIN: No, I'm just going to do the
(mumbling).

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.233
ASHLEY: Razzle dazzle?

00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:58.540
TALIESIN: Yeah, like the razzle dazzle.

00:53:58.540 --> 00:53:59.676
MATT: All right. So--

00:53:59.676 --> 00:54:05.733
LIAM: Here's a question. I'm sorry. How wide
apart-- is it bars, the fence? What kind of fence

00:54:05.733 --> 00:54:06.741
do we have?

00:54:06.741 --> 00:54:11.325
MATT: There are large metal poles incrementally,
about every 12 or so feet. In between there it

00:54:11.325 --> 00:54:18.794
looks like there are cross lattices of an inch
wide and a quarter-inch thick metal bars that

00:54:18.794 --> 00:54:20.841
weave across to form the fence.

00:54:20.841 --> 00:54:22.795
LIAM: So that bucket is not going between any of
that.

00:54:22.795 --> 00:54:24.198
MATT: Probably not.

00:54:24.198 --> 00:54:30.466
LIAM: Nott, would you be able to use your
invisible hand to lift that up and over?

00:54:30.466 --> 00:54:32.312
SAM: When Schmidt comes close enough, yes.

00:54:32.312 --> 00:54:33.503
LIAM: Okay.

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:35.673
MATT: All right. You guys are prepared?

00:54:35.673 --> 00:54:36.611
TALIESIN: Yep.

00:54:36.611 --> 00:54:42.754
MATT: I would like you to make an acrobatics check
with advantage because you're being aided by

00:54:42.754 --> 00:54:43.911
Yasha.

00:54:43.911 --> 00:54:47.141
MARISHA: I'll keep watch.

00:54:47.141 --> 00:54:49.424
TALIESIN: Oof, ten.

00:54:49.424 --> 00:54:57.860
MATT: Ten. As you reach down, grabbing the foot of
Mollymauk, with one big (grunt) you lift him, and

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:02.910
he tosses in the air, gracefully, arms out, almost
like a reverse swan dive into the air. You land

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:06.298
and (impact).

00:55:06.298 --> 00:55:07.702
(groaning)

00:55:07.702 --> 00:55:13.309
MATT: Land legs open, you manage to miss the vital
areas, but it definitely wracks the inside of the

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:15.979
thigh a little bit, a painful landing.

00:55:16.023 --> 00:55:18.472
TALIESIN: Can I try and push up into a handstand?

00:55:18.472 --> 00:55:24.838
MATT: You manage to do so, but it lacks the
presentational and grace element of it. Make a

00:55:24.838 --> 00:55:27.433
performance check, but with disadvantage from the
impact.

00:55:27.433 --> 00:55:32.299
LIAM: So when he crashes, right at that moment, I
ask Schmidt to move the bucket three feet closer

00:55:32.299 --> 00:55:34.269
to us. Low to the ground.

00:55:34.269 --> 00:55:37.073
TALIESIN: All right.

00:55:37.073 --> 00:55:39.312
ASHLEY: Can I aid him-- okay.

00:55:39.312 --> 00:55:43.423
TALIESIN: Yeah, natural 20. Oh, no, disadvantage.
15.

00:55:43.423 --> 00:55:49.578
MATT: 15, okay. Still pretty good. So in spite of
the (strained) impact, you slowly stagger back up

00:55:49.578 --> 00:55:51.166
to the top, balance yourself.

00:55:51.166 --> 00:55:55.041
TALIESIN: Up and flipping back up, and I'm going
get the swords out. I'm going to start slowly

00:55:55.041 --> 00:56:01.393
working on moving down the fence, with both swords
doing a spin and trying to actually get a little

00:56:01.393 --> 00:56:03.121
flip going. A little acrobatic--

00:56:03.121 --> 00:56:04.883
LIAM: Oh boy, another ten feet towards me.

00:56:04.883 --> 00:56:07.227
TALIESIN: I'll need you spotting, 'cause I'm not
great at this.

00:56:07.227 --> 00:56:12.524
MATT: All right, you're turning it around. It's
starting to work into your advantage. As this is

00:56:12.524 --> 00:56:18.205
happening, Schmidt is slowly dragging, on its own,
the Unseen Servant is dragging this bucket three

00:56:18.205 --> 00:56:20.520
feet at a time (scraping).

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.378
MARISHA: I'm keeping watch for any workers who
might be noticing the bucket.

00:56:23.378 --> 00:56:26.394
MATT: None seem to be noticing the bucket at the
moment, but you do see about three or four that

00:56:26.394 --> 00:56:33.692
are looking over at this very colorful, flashy,
performing, nearly wracked tiefling who is in the

00:56:33.692 --> 00:56:40.986
process of juggling swords in the air and doing a
series of completely spontaneous performance art

00:56:40.986 --> 00:56:42.371
for no reason.

00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:43.915
MARISHA: Bravo. Bravo!

00:56:43.915 --> 00:56:47.774
MATT: You see two of the nearby workers start
looking over confused, start talking to each

00:56:47.774 --> 00:56:52.242
other. You can hear the muttering. One of them
runs off to one of the supervisor dwarves who's

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:57.083
about 80 to 100 feet off to go tell him what's
happening. He looks over and eventually you hear,

00:56:57.083 --> 00:57:01.611
as Schmidt is getting closer and closer, the
bucket of tar is maybe 20 feet from the

00:57:01.611 --> 00:57:06.047
fence-line, and you hear a voice go, "Hey! Hey!
What are you doing!? Get down from there! Get-- go

00:57:06.047 --> 00:57:07.327
"on, get, get, get!"

00:57:07.327 --> 00:57:10.372
TALIESIN: I'm going to jump onto your shoulders
now. So, I take a jump and try and land on the

00:57:10.372 --> 00:57:12.317
shoulders. Straight acrobatics?

00:57:12.317 --> 00:57:13.459
MATT: Straight acrobatics for this.

00:57:13.459 --> 00:57:19.593
TALIESIN: All right. You go away; I'm trying you.
That's a natural 20.

00:57:19.593 --> 00:57:21.364
ASHLEY: Ooh.

00:57:21.364 --> 00:57:28.090
MATT: (flipping) (impact) Landing right onto
Yasha's shoulders. She catches you there, and

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:33.441
you're still, from their perspective you jumped
off of the fence and landed behind the fence, and are--

00:57:33.441 --> 00:57:37.044
ASHLEY: I'm going to do a little side by side
walking to make it look like he's--

00:57:37.044 --> 00:57:40.392
TALIESIN: Sorry, you had a great fence, and we're
working on an act!

00:57:40.392 --> 00:57:43.144
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:57:43.144 --> 00:57:44.918
TALIESIN: It's true.

00:57:44.918 --> 00:57:48.187
MARISHA: Nott, how close does Mage Hand have to
be?

00:57:48.187 --> 00:57:53.212
SAM: It could go now, but we can't go fast,
they'll see a moving bucket.

00:57:53.212 --> 00:57:55.195
LIAM: Yeah, we don't want it off the ground.

00:57:55.195 --> 00:57:56.941
TALIESIN: That's nine.

00:57:56.941 --> 00:58:03.697
MATT: Nine, okay. It's not that they don't buy it, they're just
more caught off-guard by your presence, and not

00:58:03.805 --> 00:58:07.102
listening to the words you're saying. The one
supervisor who keeps rushing forward goes, "You

00:58:07.102 --> 00:58:13.233
"know, lad, you don't have permission. Show me
your--" At which point you see Cleff, looking

00:58:13.233 --> 00:58:20.495
nervously, steps forward and goes, "Hello there.
Cleff Tinkertop, we're all right. They're with

00:58:20.495 --> 00:58:27.611
"me." The dwarf comes to a slow jog, to a stop, and
goes, "Cleff, what the fuck are you doing down

00:58:27.611 --> 00:58:36.981
"here?" Schmidt drags the bucket about 15 feet off
to the side, and it is near the base of the fence.

00:58:36.981 --> 00:58:38.592
SAM: Okay, I'll cast Mage Hand.

00:58:38.592 --> 00:58:39.741
MATT: Okay.

00:58:39.741 --> 00:58:42.137
SAM: Are people looking right now?

00:58:42.137 --> 00:58:43.475
MATT: Yes, they are looking.

00:58:43.475 --> 00:58:44.408
SAM: Okay.

00:58:44.408 --> 00:58:48.424
MATT: It's about 15-20 feet to the left, but
they're currently focused on your group, which is

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:52.435
gathered at the edge of the yard where they
assemble all of their very powerful military

00:58:52.435 --> 00:58:53.335
weapons.

00:58:53.335 --> 00:58:55.871
TALIESIN: We should be at separate ends of the
fence right now, because I made my way down the

00:58:55.871 --> 00:58:57.238
fence with Yasha.

00:58:57.238 --> 00:59:03.927
MATT: Right, so it was about 30 feet, we'll say.
So are you attempting to--

00:59:03.927 --> 00:59:06.790
SAM: I'm just going to wait until they finish
their conversation.

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:07.834
MATT: All right.

00:59:07.834 --> 00:59:11.964
LIAM: I'll try to edge it a little closer still.
I'd like to get it near the fence, if I can.

00:59:11.964 --> 00:59:15.187
MATT: It's actually right now, with that final
scoot from Schmidt, it's right up against the

00:59:15.187 --> 00:59:16.720
fence on the opposite side.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:22.543
LIAM: Okay, then I'm just going to wait for the
right moment. Then I'll have Schmidt lift it over

00:59:22.543 --> 00:59:24.375
his head, but not yet.

00:59:24.375 --> 00:59:32.690
MATT: Okay. At this point, the dwarf rushes up to
the edge and peers through and goes, "So, strange

00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:36.596
"arrivals you got here, Cleff, and a couple of
loonies diving off the outside of our very

00:59:36.596 --> 00:59:44.733
"well-protected fence, but sure. Cleff, what's your
business with these assholes?" He's like, "We're

00:59:44.733 --> 00:59:51.873
"making our way to try and make right some mistakes
I've made, certainly, hopefully." He glances through

00:59:51.873 --> 00:59:58.990
with a bit of a tightened gaze and goes, "All
right. Well, just keep them off my fence."

00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:00.452
TALIESIN: A lovely fence it is.

01:00:00.452 --> 01:00:03.451
MATT: Turns around and starts walking back to his
post.

01:00:03.509 --> 01:00:09.195
SAM: As he starts walking, I'll nod to Caleb and
try to do the lift over the fence.

01:00:09.195 --> 01:00:10.839
LIAM: Oh, jeez, I go--

01:00:10.839 --> 01:00:14.012
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check to see if you
can make the right timing and do so swift enough

01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:16.690
to where nobody seems to notice.

01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:20.360
SAM: Sleight of hand? 22.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:25.014
MATT: With that, as soon as the dwarf turns around
and all the rest of the workers go right back

01:00:25.014 --> 01:00:32.014
simultaneously, seeing that this encounter is
over, turn back to their work. (whooshing) Without

01:00:32.014 --> 01:00:36.170
a sound, rises over the fence and is now at your
disposal on the opposite end.

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.729
SAM: Yeah!

01:00:38.729 --> 01:00:41.504
ASHLEY: Hopefully that will do something.

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:47.789
SAM: We have a bucket of tar! Part one of our plan
is complete.

01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:51.544
LIAM: That's how you do it. You set them up, and
knock them down.

01:00:51.544 --> 01:00:53.273
SAM: Look at that teamwork.

01:00:53.273 --> 01:00:54.451
MARISHA: It was pretty good.

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:58.974
SAM: Yeah, everybody contributed a little. Except
for Jester and Fjord, everyone was really good.

01:00:58.974 --> 01:01:01.033
TALISIN: When do they ever contribute, really?

01:01:01.151 --> 01:01:09.315
MATT: (laughter) Rissa goes, "All right, that's the first
part of it. What's next?"

01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:11.283
ASHLEY: I guess we head to the prison.

01:01:11.283 --> 01:01:13.607
MARISHA: To the prison!

01:01:13.607 --> 01:01:20.783
SAM: Let's put the tar bucket in the haversack of
holding, if that's possible. If it will fit.

01:01:20.783 --> 01:01:23.184
MARISHA: Will it tip over in the bag?

01:01:23.184 --> 01:01:28.700
MATT: She takes it and slowly puts it inside. It
will fit in the larger one, so it slips inside the

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.895
bag. She closes it. "Okay. Are you sure it won't
turn over?"

01:01:31.895 --> 01:01:33.322
MARISHA and TALIESIN: No.

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:35.029
SAM: I don't know.

01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:37.124
MATT: "I don't want to ruin my bag."

01:01:37.124 --> 01:01:38.479
TALIESIN: Then we don't have to put it in. We'll
just carry it.

01:01:38.479 --> 01:01:39.535
MATT: "I paid good money for it, and it's so
pretty."

01:01:39.535 --> 01:01:40.935
TALIESIN: We'll carry it.

01:01:40.935 --> 01:01:42.924
SAM: Then we're carrying a bucket of tar. Is that
weird?

01:01:42.924 --> 01:01:44.134
TALIESIN: We're going in to kill a robot. It's
fine.

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:46.369
SAM: All right. We'll just carry it.

01:01:46.422 --> 01:01:50.115
TALIESIN: What else do you bring into a -- What do
they think we're going to do with a bucket of tar?

01:01:50.115 --> 01:01:51.412
ASHLEY: I'll take it.

01:01:51.462 --> 01:01:52.891
MATT: Carefully hands it to Yasha.

01:01:52.891 --> 01:01:53.960
TALIESIN: Let's lean into it.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.573
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:01:55.573 --> 01:02:03.991
MATT: Rissa continues pushing you now away from
the Assembly Yard, back into the Iron Lot, and

01:02:03.991 --> 01:02:17.957
towards the exterior of the Gearhold Prison.
There, on the outside of this doorway, there's

01:02:17.957 --> 01:02:25.637
about a dozen crownsguard, mostly gnomish, two
human. It looks like they're both currently

01:02:25.637 --> 01:02:31.226
decorated with a bit more detail, probably sent
from the capital, or at least are given a little

01:02:31.226 --> 01:02:36.951
more of import to the outside of this guarding
post. As you approach, you can see these large

01:02:36.951 --> 01:02:41.503
metal doors. There are two of them, and they open
in the center, and there are a set of smaller

01:02:41.503 --> 01:02:47.187
doors built in the base of each of the sides. As
you approach, some of the crownsguard look over

01:02:47.187 --> 01:02:52.123
curiously at this interesting, wayward group
making their way towards the outside. Three of

01:02:52.123 --> 01:02:57.924
them begin to approach, and one of the humans in
the more intricate crownsguard uniform approaches,

01:02:57.924 --> 01:03:02.187
throwing the cloak over his shoulder, and you can
see his hand resting on the handle of his

01:03:02.187 --> 01:03:08.382
now-sheathed sword. "Hey, who goes there? What is
your business?"

01:03:08.382 --> 01:03:14.098
MARISHA: We are a contracted group of workers,
working for this man right here, Cleff. We're here

01:03:14.098 --> 01:03:19.366
to take care of the problem that we heard you guys
had with the clockwork warden.

01:03:19.366 --> 01:03:26.279
MATT: Cleff pulls the hood back a bit and goes,
"Hello." Guy takes a moment and looks. Make a

01:03:26.279 --> 01:03:29.287
persuasion check with advantage, because Cleff is
helping you.

01:03:29.287 --> 01:03:32.922
SAM: Yeah. Persuasive Beau.

01:03:32.922 --> 01:03:39.097
MARISHA: I stole this die that I got you from
forever ago. It's got the little d20 inside of it.

01:03:39.097 --> 01:03:44.727
I'll take the 12, for 13.

01:03:44.727 --> 01:03:51.429
MATT: The guard steps back a bit, looks you over.
"All right. Hold tight a second, I'm going to

01:03:51.429 --> 01:04:01.133
"summon the warden. Just a moment." He steps to one
of the small doors that opens, and he disappears inside.

01:04:01.185 --> 01:04:02.601
SAM: How many doors are there?

01:04:02.601 --> 01:04:08.714
MATT: There's the two large main doors, about 15
feet tall, about 20 foot wide, and then there's

01:04:08.714 --> 01:04:12.369
smaller doors, normal person-sized, almost
gnomish-sized, doors built into it from that

01:04:12.369 --> 01:04:17.997
point. You actually watch as the human crownsguard
has to duck a little bit to go through the smaller

01:04:17.997 --> 01:04:24.808
door frame. He's gone for about five minutes or
so, and then returns and says, "The Wardenhelm

01:04:24.808 --> 01:04:30.686
"would wish to speak to you, if you wouldn't mind
stepping inside. Don't mind the escort; it's

01:04:30.686 --> 01:04:33.698
"common business."

01:04:33.698 --> 01:04:36.061
MARISHA: What did you say the warden's name was?

01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:40.276
MATT: It's Wardenhelm Poppin Drokrusher.

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:42.399
MARISHA: Wardenhelm Poppin--

01:04:42.399 --> 01:04:44.546
MATT: Poppin Drokrusher.

01:04:44.546 --> 01:04:46.141
MARISHA: Drokrusher.

01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:50.796
TALIESIN: Poppin Drok-- I won't. I won't speak.
I'm not going to speak.

01:04:50.796 --> 01:04:55.653
MATT: He's like, "Gnomish names."

01:04:55.653 --> 01:04:56.646
TALIESIN: I feel that.

01:04:56.646 --> 01:05:01.842
MATT: At that point, you guys are led inside the
dark interior. As soon as you step into the shadow

01:05:01.842 --> 01:05:09.754
of the entryway of this prison, you go from the
industrial and somewhat colorless Iron Lot that

01:05:09.754 --> 01:05:16.847
you've been traveling through to this very
low-lit, reddish, almost oxidized iron interior

01:05:16.847 --> 01:05:26.107
that is just shadow and torches. You can see these
large support beams of metal put against the rock

01:05:26.107 --> 01:05:31.113
and stone that has been carved out of the interior
of the mountain. It's just one long hallway that

01:05:31.113 --> 01:05:34.982
splinters off into a number of hallways to the
right and left before it reaches the outside of

01:05:34.982 --> 01:05:41.583
your current visual range to make any more detail
out of it. At this point, as you enter, about five

01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:50.829
more of the crownsguard follow behind you and keep
you all as a small pack traveling. At this point,

01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:57.066
he begins to move forward and gestures for you all
to follow, saying, "This way." Leads you down the

01:05:57.066 --> 01:06:02.065
hall, scooting to the right and heads to the right
at the very first branching hallway of the

01:06:02.065 --> 01:06:07.886
interior of the prison. Heading further down,
there's a few doors that are open, and on the

01:06:07.886 --> 01:06:13.378
inside they appear to be empty, or there's a few
other guards. On the interior, you don't see much

01:06:13.378 --> 01:06:18.046
in the way of crownsguard, you see a different
type of guard. Similar garb, but more drab, and

01:06:18.046 --> 01:06:21.573
you get the sense that they're-- this is an
internal prison guard, this isn't part of the

01:06:21.573 --> 01:06:30.105
paid, trained, citywide guard. These are the
interior Hupperdook prison guards. No more than

01:06:30.105 --> 01:06:35.024
maybe another 40 or so feet down, there's a
doorway that's open that leads into an office. On

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:41.621
the inside of this office, which itself is also
super darkly lit, you see two ember torches that

01:06:41.621 --> 01:06:47.788
give this very dull red glow on the inside of the
room, so it has this somewhat ominous and dreary

01:06:47.788 --> 01:06:54.285
interior presence to it as you step into this
chamber. The desk is facing away from you, and

01:06:54.285 --> 01:07:01.718
there you see an older and grizzled gnome, who is
in the process of wearing these series of robes

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:10.181
and cloak over him with these gold-colored tassels
and epaulets that shoot off the sides, seems to be

01:07:10.181 --> 01:07:15.430
giving out an air of station and importance, even
though it's just in the process of filing what

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:19.604
looks to be either prison transfers or people that
have been arrested and figuring out who's to be

01:07:19.604 --> 01:07:24.427
put in here and why, or whose business is going to
come to an end soon. He's in the process of

01:07:24.427 --> 01:07:30.777
shuffling through papers before turning around to
you and goes, "All right, so, you have come to my

01:07:30.777 --> 01:07:38.177
"prison." Stands up and turns around to you,
clicking his feet together as he does so at

01:07:38.177 --> 01:07:44.998
attention, arms crossed. "Hello. I'm the
Wardenhelm Poppin. You have bothered me from my

01:07:44.998 --> 01:07:52.646
"work, and I would like to know why." As you look
at him, you can see his hair has receded almost

01:07:52.646 --> 01:07:58.120
entirely to the back, and what bits of clustered
gray hair on the sides he’s currently attempted to

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:04.577
slick and comb back, and one large part of it is
trying to cover the massive bald spot, but as he

01:08:04.577 --> 01:08:09.924
spins around and talks to you, with any sort of
movement it wobbles and has to settle itself back

01:08:09.924 --> 01:08:11.127
into place.

01:08:11.127 --> 01:08:11.857
TALIESIN: Beau--

01:08:11.857 --> 01:08:14.204
MARISHA: First off--

01:08:14.204 --> 01:08:17.414
TALIESIN: I tap Beau on the back and make her bow
a little bit.

01:08:17.414 --> 01:08:20.515
MARISHA: You don't have to-- okay.

01:08:20.515 --> 01:08:23.777
MATT: "Respectful. I appreciate that."

01:08:23.777 --> 01:08:27.021
TALIESIN: Pull her back up.

01:08:27.021 --> 01:08:31.473
MATT: Rissa has backed away to the doorway and is
like-- and doesn't want any part in this.

01:08:31.473 --> 01:08:40.535
MARISHA: Yeah. Same, Rissa, same. We will not take
up much of your time if you just let us in to go

01:08:40.535 --> 01:08:46.946
kill this clockwork warden that this guy made. We
heard he was quite a problem. Just let us in;

01:08:46.946 --> 01:08:51.425
we'll be out of your hair, and you can get back to
your work.

01:08:51.425 --> 01:08:56.349
MATT: "Wait, what are you--" And he looks over
towards the cloaked gnomish figure to the side.

01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:57.835
"What?"

01:08:57.835 --> 01:08:59.276
MARISHA: Remember this guy?

01:08:59.276 --> 01:09:06.352
MATT: He leans forward, and as the cloak is pulled
back, Cleff reveals his face a bit. He goes,

01:09:06.352 --> 01:09:14.905
"Hello there. It's been a while. How are you
doing, Poppin?" He's like, "Interesting riffraff

01:09:14.905 --> 01:09:17.333
"you're bringing to my home this day."

01:09:17.333 --> 01:09:18.956
MARISHA: Why do people keep calling us that?

01:09:18.956 --> 01:09:20.257
TALIESIN: To be fair, we are.

01:09:20.257 --> 01:09:26.923
MATT: "I was referring to Cleff! Cleff, why do you
come and bother me with my day's work? What do you

01:09:26.923 --> 01:09:31.603
"want? You're saying something about your little
mistake, your problem?"

01:09:31.603 --> 01:09:37.441
MARISHA: Look, this guy is funding to take care of
the spinning death machine that's in your guys'

01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:44.682
basement. This should be a city-funded issue, but
this guy is being a good, noble citizen and

01:09:44.682 --> 01:09:51.453
funding it himself so we can come and make a quick
buck and kill your death robot. Can we please just

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:54.511
go kill your damn death robot?

01:09:54.511 --> 01:10:01.152
MATT: He looks at Cleff. "Is this true?" Cleff
nods. "Actually, yes. I know it's been a problem

01:10:01.152 --> 01:10:09.132
"for a while and I figured, about time I cleaned up
that mess myself, if you don't mind." The

01:10:09.132 --> 01:10:14.654
Wardenhelm stops for a second and looks amongst
the rest of you. "Right, okay. You have what

01:10:14.654 --> 01:10:20.766
"appears to be an interesting crew of exterminators
you've brought to me. What do you want from me? I

01:10:20.766 --> 01:10:26.174
"assume you have come here for trade or for looking
for some sort of recompense. I would like to know

01:10:26.174 --> 01:10:31.933
"what that is before we move further into this. No
one steps inside here wishing to do us, how you

01:10:31.933 --> 01:10:34.621
"say? Charity work."

01:10:34.675 --> 01:10:38.876
TALIESIN: Oh, of course. That makes perfect sense,
and of course a man of your stature would be smart

01:10:38.876 --> 01:10:44.525
enough to know that such a thing is true. We,
honestly-- we will admit we may have a favor, a

01:10:44.525 --> 01:10:49.035
very minor favor, to ask if everything goes well
and we do, in fact, survive this encounter. In

01:10:49.035 --> 01:10:54.178
return, also, we will be gathering very valuable
data on how to defeat these sort of automatons,

01:10:54.178 --> 01:10:59.194
which will be put into your possession and would
definitely help you deliver something that could

01:10:59.194 --> 01:11:05.665
help with the war effort. This sort of data could
get back to the people in charge and help them

01:11:05.665 --> 01:11:10.277
defeat machines in the future. We're trying new
techniques, new ways to defeat these sort of automatons.

01:11:10.277 --> 01:11:13.066
MARISHA: You look like a man who's willing to
climb a ladder.

01:11:13.066 --> 01:11:15.395
TALIESIN: I think you could go far. We'd be happy
to help.

01:11:15.395 --> 01:11:18.066
MARISHA: War is a great time for opportunity, my
friend.

01:11:18.066 --> 01:11:24.907
TALIESIN: We may discuss, perhaps, if we can
help-- we have two friends who are currently in

01:11:24.907 --> 01:11:30.215
your system, and we would be more than happy to
discuss a means of maybe resolving their issue

01:11:30.215 --> 01:11:37.734
with you. Not innocence, but just coming to a
conclusion that is mutually agreeable.

01:11:37.734 --> 01:11:42.021
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage,
with aiding from Beau and a very persuasive

01:11:42.021 --> 01:11:43.198
argument, actually.

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.649
TALIESIN: Man, I love bullshitting.

01:11:44.649 --> 01:11:46.684
MARISHA: (laughs) High-fivesies from across the
table.

01:11:46.684 --> 01:11:54.798
TALIESIN: Persuasion? God, please, for once in
your miserable life. Oh man, eight.

01:11:54.798 --> 01:11:56.726
MATT: Oh, buddy.

01:11:56.726 --> 01:11:58.745
LIAM: Not life, just this campaign, Taliesin.

01:11:58.745 --> 01:12:01.933
TALIESIN: I know.

01:12:01.933 --> 01:12:08.226
MATT: "Well, perhaps we can discuss, but I would
like to see possibly this deed you wish to do done

01:12:08.226 --> 01:12:14.796
"first. I do not wish to talk contracts with those
who are about to die, if you know what I'm saying."

01:12:14.796 --> 01:12:15.875
TALIESIN: Hardly waste your time.

01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:17.683
MARISHA: Who would?

01:12:17.683 --> 01:12:24.008
MATT: "Very well." He looks past you to the escort
of guards that have followed you in. "Lead them to

01:12:24.008 --> 01:12:31.656
"the subterranean sealed chamber. Allow them to
encounter our issue, and should they survive,

01:12:31.656 --> 01:12:35.426
"return them to me with proof of the deed. Should
they not survive, we will not speak of this ever

01:12:35.426 --> 01:12:45.216
"again. Good luck. I will be here waiting to hear
of your successful endeavor. Now, leave me to my

01:12:45.216 --> 01:12:47.542
"work." He goes and sits back down in his chair.

01:12:47.542 --> 01:12:48.491
SAM: We're doing this now?

01:12:48.491 --> 01:12:52.242
TALIESIN: Of course we are. Anyone want the node?

01:12:52.242 --> 01:12:59.334
SAM: If I'm going to be throwing tar at this
thing, maybe I should have it.

01:12:59.334 --> 01:13:01.116
TALIESIN: Or Caleb. Well, who's going to be
throwing --

01:13:01.116 --> 01:13:03.934
MARISHA: Who's going to be throwing the tar? You
with your Mage Hand, maybe?

01:13:03.934 --> 01:13:04.884
SAM: I could.

01:13:04.884 --> 01:13:08.943
TALIESIN: We'll heat it up. Caleb will heat it up,
you'll throw it in, and then I'll be using some

01:13:08.943 --> 01:13:11.290
ice to try and cool the thing down once it's in
there.

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:15.639
MARISHA: Yasha and I can try and pin it down,
maybe corner it.

01:13:15.639 --> 01:13:20.531
TALIESIN: Once it starts opening up the armor,
we'll just go to that one particular plate and

01:13:20.531 --> 01:13:21.818
start ripping a hole in it.

01:13:21.818 --> 01:13:23.754
MARISHA: Start ripping the plates off.

01:13:23.754 --> 01:13:25.015
TALIESIN: Chopping the plates off.

01:13:25.015 --> 01:13:25.976
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:13:25.976 --> 01:13:29.016
LIAM: Let's heat that tar up before entering.

01:13:29.016 --> 01:13:31.152
MARISHA: Let's get to the door, heat it up--

01:13:31.152 --> 01:13:36.018
TALIESIN: We'll get through doors, set the node,
set everything we need into action.

01:13:36.018 --> 01:13:40.997
MATT: Cleff and Rissa balk there as you guys are
having this conversation. Rissa goes, "If it's not

01:13:40.997 --> 01:13:47.065
"a problem, I'll stay here with my dad and we'll
just wait to hear what happens. We're not much in

01:13:47.065 --> 01:13:50.677
"the way of charging into the fray."

01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:55.483
LIAM: Of course. You have tasked experts with this
job.

01:13:55.483 --> 01:14:03.334
MATT: Of course. Cleff pushes past and goes, "But
before you go, I just want once more to express my

01:14:03.334 --> 01:14:08.794
"extreme gratitude for your putting yourself out
there for my well-being. A Tinkertop never forgets

01:14:08.794 --> 01:14:15.521
"these deeds, and should you return safely, I will
be in your debt." He bows and the cloak (thumps)

01:14:15.521 --> 01:14:19.554
onto the ground,and he goes, "Oh." He picks it
back up and bows a little less this time.

01:14:19.554 --> 01:14:22.994
MARISHA: Any last tips, Cleff?

01:14:22.994 --> 01:14:24.520
MATT: "Be careful?"

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.739
MARISHA: That's a good one.

01:14:25.739 --> 01:14:27.378
TALIESIN: What kind of feet does it have again?

01:14:27.378 --> 01:14:31.178
MATT: "Oh, it doesn't have feet. It rolls."

01:14:31.178 --> 01:14:32.059
TALIESIN: Ball bearings?

01:14:32.059 --> 01:14:34.048
MARISHA: Hamster ball.

01:14:34.048 --> 01:14:39.569
TALIESIN: We'll see. Slow it down. I don't know,
we'll find out.

01:14:39.569 --> 01:14:40.472
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:14:40.472 --> 01:14:43.155
SAM: All right. So the guards will take us down?

01:14:43.155 --> 01:14:48.910
MATT: You guys currently have a group of six
crownsguard from the outside and a couple of

01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:50.506
prison guards that will lead you there.

01:14:50.506 --> 01:14:53.713
TALIESIN: Tank this, and you'll be all right. It's
just swords.

01:14:53.713 --> 01:14:57.129
ASHLEY: I want to get a good look at it, but this
sounds like a fun challenge.

01:14:57.129 --> 01:14:59.950
TALIESIN: Fjord, you got a plan? Jester?

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:07.620
MATT: Jester goes, "Well, don't die, and if you
fall over, I'll try to get you not on the ground anymore."

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:12.734
SAM: She can't. She's out of spells.

01:15:12.734 --> 01:15:16.327
MATT: How is she out of spells? You guys took a
long rest.

01:15:16.327 --> 01:15:17.283
SAM: Didn't we use a bunch?

01:15:17.283 --> 01:15:18.128
TALIESIN: No, we took a long rest.

01:15:18.128 --> 01:15:21.414
MATT: She used two Locate Objects, I know that.

01:15:21.414 --> 01:15:23.527
SAM: Those are high-level spells.

01:15:23.527 --> 01:15:24.915
MATT: They're 2nd-level, I think. Isn't it?

01:15:24.915 --> 01:15:28.462
SAM: Okay. Does it say how many spells she has
left?

01:15:28.462 --> 01:15:31.432
TALIESIN: It should.

01:15:31.432 --> 01:15:32.836
MATT: Yeah, Locate Object is 2nd-level.

01:15:32.836 --> 01:15:37.736
MARISHA: To be fair, I think we were going to
rest, and we decided against it. We decided to go.

01:15:37.736 --> 01:15:41.468
SAM: Oh, it reset, but she definitely had used
some.

01:15:41.468 --> 01:15:42.527
MARISHA: We know she used two--

01:15:42.527 --> 01:15:44.974
MATT: She's used two 2nd-level spells.

01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:46.669
ASHLEY: She has used two 2nd-level spells?

01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:52.834
MATT: So we'll mark those in there. If she had
another, it's fine. She's not here to keep track.

01:15:52.834 --> 01:16:01.015
TALIESIN: Do we want her to have anything
pre-cast? I don't think Duplicity will matter, but

01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:03.813
maybe a Spiritual Weapon already called up?

01:16:03.813 --> 01:16:05.334
LIAM: Spiritual Weapon is a good idea.

01:16:05.334 --> 01:16:07.787
TALIESIN: Just have it already. Let's--

01:16:07.787 --> 01:16:08.741
MATT: Well, it only lasts for a minute.

01:16:08.741 --> 01:16:10.805
TALIESIN: Oh, then let's wait then. All right.

01:16:10.805 --> 01:16:19.004
SAM: In case this all goes tits-up, do we want to
try to talk to these guards and maybe figure out

01:16:19.004 --> 01:16:23.684
what cell the Schusters are in?

01:16:23.684 --> 01:16:24.981
TALIESIN: You're welcome to try.

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:28.757
SAM: I'm not talking to them. But someone with
more charisma than me?

01:16:28.757 --> 01:16:29.968
TALIESIN: Certainly not me.

01:16:29.968 --> 01:16:35.061
MARISHA: Fjord's literally the only one that can
charm a guard. Unless we bribe a guard.

01:16:35.061 --> 01:16:36.228
LIAM: That is incorrect.

01:16:36.228 --> 01:16:39.655
SAM: Oh. Charming Caleb.

01:16:39.655 --> 01:16:42.776
LIAM: (clears throat) I can speak when I have to.

01:16:42.776 --> 01:16:44.861
MARISHA: Do some Suggestion stuff?

01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:46.121
SAM: I mean, is that worth doing now?

01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:47.781
LIAM: No I can just talk.

01:16:47.781 --> 01:16:50.246
TALIESIN: I mean, if we die, does it matter?

01:16:50.246 --> 01:16:53.450
SAM: No, but I mean if the warden doesn't give us
what we want.

01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:55.203
TALIESIN: We can talk to the guards on the way
out.

01:16:55.203 --> 01:16:57.138
SAM: Okay. But we're in the prison.

01:16:57.138 --> 01:16:59.499
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we're going to be in the
prison when we're done.

01:16:59.499 --> 01:17:00.379
SAM: All right.

01:17:00.379 --> 01:17:00.851
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:02.067
SAM: Okay.

01:17:02.067 --> 01:17:06.644
TALIESIN: (laughs) Assuming we live.

01:17:06.644 --> 01:17:12.350
MATT: The guards have led you away from that end
of the chamber, down the hall, back to the main

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:19.334
hallway that enters deeper into the Gearhold
Prison. Following that down for another 80 or so

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:25.524
feet, that main open hallway comes to an end, and
there are a number of other small hallways that

01:17:25.524 --> 01:17:29.799
protrude. The guards lead you down the one on the
left. You can see two immediately that branch off

01:17:29.799 --> 01:17:35.251
on the far end of that main open way. That
left-side pathway leads to a set of stairs that

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:42.808
spirals down to a second floor. Then a third
floor. Then a fourth floor. The fourth floor is

01:17:42.808 --> 01:17:45.969
the bottom of these stairs, and you're now
probably guessing, from the time it's taken you to

01:17:45.969 --> 01:17:53.399
descend the spiral staircase, maybe an additional
100 to 120 feet below the entrance and the actual

01:17:53.399 --> 01:17:59.831
level base of the mountain. At this point, you
continue down a hallway and there are cells to

01:17:59.831 --> 01:18:04.848
your right and left. As you enter the space, the
cells are very well-fortified, and behind the

01:18:04.848 --> 01:18:11.778
bars, in the dark, dark red ember-like torchlight
that faintly glows and lights elements of this

01:18:11.778 --> 01:18:16.633
hallway, as you continue down, you can see shapes,
humanoid shapes locked behind bars, of all shapes

01:18:16.633 --> 01:18:22.966
and sizes. As you begin to pass one on the right,
you watch as a figure lurches up to the bars,

01:18:22.966 --> 01:18:27.346
pushes up to the edge, and what faint bit of red
light you can see illuminating a face that looks

01:18:27.346 --> 01:18:34.056
scarred by a large, heavy clawmark down one side,
the eye glued shut from the healing process. You

01:18:34.056 --> 01:18:39.643
see this toothy, rotten grin underneath as a nasty
smell of breath emanates from its heavy breathing,

01:18:39.643 --> 01:18:46.914
and as you pass by, it says, "Hey. Are you going
to come back, are you? Where are you going? Where

01:18:46.914 --> 01:18:51.970
"are you going? Come back!" And you walk past. One
of the guards takes their shortsword and clangs it

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:55.001
across the metal and goes, "Keep back, keep back."

01:18:55.001 --> 01:19:00.610
TALIESIN: Mr. Schuster, you look terrible! I yell
very loud to see if anybody responds to the name.

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:01.371
MATT: To what name?

01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:02.004
TALIESIN: Mr. Schuster.

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:06.836
MATT: Schuster? Okay. You listen. Make a
perception check.

01:19:06.836 --> 01:19:08.863
SAM: Yeah, sure.

01:19:08.863 --> 01:19:14.021
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a 15.

01:19:14.021 --> 01:19:18.649
MATT: Okay. You listen out, and you hear a few
voices chuckle and some shifting of people that

01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:24.610
are now making their way to the front of the cell
to see what this arriving group of strangers is,

01:19:24.610 --> 01:19:28.868
but nothing out of the expected ordinary reacting
to that name.

01:19:28.868 --> 01:19:29.801
TALIESIN: Worth a shot.

01:19:29.801 --> 01:19:34.522
MATT: A few other figures push their way to the
face, and you can see men and women, you can see

01:19:34.522 --> 01:19:41.036
decrepit half-elves that look poorly nourished.
You can see humans that look like they've smeared

01:19:41.036 --> 01:19:46.201
themselves with their own foul excrement. You can
see a whole nature of people that are in the

01:19:46.201 --> 01:19:53.522
process of dealing with being locked down here in
the subterranean basement level of this prison.

01:19:53.522 --> 01:20:00.275
And then, at the end, you come to what looks to be
an iron door that is currently sealed shut, with

01:20:00.275 --> 01:20:06.313
what looks to be rung after rung after rung of
chains pulled through, across bars, locked with

01:20:06.313 --> 01:20:08.210
three padlocks.

01:20:08.210 --> 01:20:10.233
MARISHA: Is this the door?

01:20:10.233 --> 01:20:14.448
MATT: The main guard sitting there goes, "Aye, it
is." He pulls out a ring of keys.

01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:16.633
TALIESIN: When's the last time you opened it?

01:20:16.633 --> 01:20:18.815
MATT: "When we sealed it."

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:20.017
ASHLEY: Which was--?

01:20:20.017 --> 01:20:23.031
MATT: "About a little over two years ago."

01:20:23.031 --> 01:20:26.464
MARISHA: How big is this chamber in here?

01:20:26.464 --> 01:20:31.381
MATT: "It leads down, splits in the middle, and
has two more sets of cells in the back side."

01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:34.631
MARISHA: Splits in the middle, two more sets of
cells on the back side. So it looks like a big

01:20:34.631 --> 01:20:40.991
fork. Does it have a common way? Or is this thing
patrolling halls?

01:20:40.991 --> 01:20:43.990
MATT: "I don't know."

01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:48.217
LIAM: And what will happen when we go inside here?
Are you locking us in?

01:20:48.217 --> 01:20:49.462
MATT: "Damn right."

01:20:49.462 --> 01:20:51.901
TALIESIN: Until we knock on the door, I imagine.

01:20:51.901 --> 01:20:54.416
LIAM: Until which.

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:58.719
MATT: With that, one latch, and one lock comes
free, pulls it off, and hands it to the guard.

01:20:58.719 --> 01:20:59.844
SAM: I'm going to look at the--

01:20:59.844 --> 01:21:01.123
MATT: Second lock, comes free.

01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:05.631
SAM: --the dodecahedron while we're at it.

01:21:05.631 --> 01:21:08.329
MATT: You take a moment to concentrate on it.

01:21:08.329 --> 01:21:10.143
MARISHA: Should we heat up the tar?

01:21:10.143 --> 01:21:13.065
TALIESIN: Let's heat up the tar.

01:21:13.065 --> 01:21:15.649
LIAM: Okay Nott, can you lift that thing up for
me?

01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:16.884
SAM: Lift?

01:21:16.884 --> 01:21:18.665
TALIESIN: I'll hold it since you're doing the
thing.

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:19.489
SAM: Oh, sure.

01:21:19.489 --> 01:21:22.702
LIAM: Well, it's going to scald the bejeezus out
of your hands if I--

01:21:22.702 --> 01:21:24.970
SAM: Okay, I'll use Mage Hand to hold it up.

01:21:24.970 --> 01:21:32.142
TALIESIN: I also have immunity to flame, so, or
not quite immunity, but I don't really mind flame.

01:21:32.142 --> 01:21:36.642
LIAM: Well, I could semi-burn your hands, or not
burn Nott's make-believe one.

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:38.534
SAM: Yeah, I'll hold it with my Mage Hand.

01:21:38.534 --> 01:21:42.465
MATT: All right. So with that, the bucket of tar
is now being held aloft from the floating,

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:45.940
spectral Mage Hand that Nott is controlling.

01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.496
TALIESIN: We'll probably need some light in here,
too.

01:21:48.496 --> 01:21:52.476
MARISHA: So, he can cast two spells; they have to
be at third level.

01:21:52.476 --> 01:21:54.022
MATT: Correct.

01:21:54.022 --> 01:21:58.131
MARISHA: And his cantrips are-- So if he casts
Armor of Agathys, it's going to take up one

01:21:58.131 --> 01:21:58.995
of his levels.

01:21:58.995 --> 01:22:00.020
MATT: Correct.

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.125
MARISHA: And Hex would be another one?

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.819
MATT: Correct.

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:10.320
LIAM: Everybody back away from this bucket. And I
crackle my hands and send a Fire Bolt at the

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.199
bottom of it.

01:22:12.199 --> 01:22:15.949
MATT: All right. So being careful not to destroy
the bucket itself, which, while it is made of

01:22:15.949 --> 01:22:20.604
metal, you're uncertain of its structural
integrity, but you do focus on a little, slow burn

01:22:20.604 --> 01:22:25.675
of this flame, controlling the Fire Bolt to be a
gradual burn. As you do, you watch as the metal

01:22:25.675 --> 01:22:32.077
iron of the bottom of this bucket begin to heat to
a dull orange, into a brighter orange. And after a

01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:42.049
few moments of concentrating, you can see a faint
(bubbling). The tar seems to be heating and to a

01:22:42.049 --> 01:22:48.018
fairly more liquidy consistency than its rather
cold and more solid form that you found it in.

01:22:48.018 --> 01:22:49.254
TALIESIN: Excellent.

01:22:49.254 --> 01:22:51.616
LIAM: That is the most relaxed that spell has ever
gone.

01:22:51.616 --> 01:22:59.513
MATT: (laughs) At which point the third lock comes
off. The guards begin pulling the chains through

01:22:59.513 --> 01:23:10.284
the various loops until eventually the door is
exposed, (creaking) opens. And on the inside,

01:23:10.284 --> 01:23:15.313
there's a few steps that descend into what looks
to be a double door beyond that. One of the doors

01:23:15.313 --> 01:23:21.326
is partially opened and it is darkness with a
faint red glow beyond that.

01:23:21.326 --> 01:23:23.863
MARISHA: This place is creepy as shit.

01:23:23.863 --> 01:23:26.401
TALIESIN: I turn to one of the guards. Is there
any light in there, or are we going to need to

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.259
bring our own?

01:23:28.259 --> 01:23:34.118
MATT: "There's probably some light, but it
wouldn't hurt to bring your own, especially for

01:23:34.118 --> 01:23:37.137
"that one." And points to Caleb.

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:40.919
LIAM: Yasha, could I borrow a torch from you?

01:23:40.919 --> 01:23:41.973
ASHLEY: Yes, of course.

01:23:41.973 --> 01:23:43.516
LIAM: So your hands are free to work.

01:23:43.516 --> 01:23:47.496
ASHLEY: Yes. Good idea. Here.

01:23:47.496 --> 01:23:49.627
LIAM: Danke.

01:23:49.627 --> 01:23:53.519
MARISHA: Fjord's going to cast Armor of Agathys on
himself.

01:23:53.519 --> 01:23:58.713
MATT: So as Fjord touches the front of his chest
armor, you watch as the cold air solidifies,

01:23:58.713 --> 01:24:02.408
getting this mist and bits of ice crystal
protruding from his leather armor.

01:24:02.408 --> 01:24:11.845
MARISHA: Hope that is a good call. What would
Fjord do? And Beau puts on her goggles.

01:24:11.845 --> 01:24:13.146
MATT: You got it.

01:24:13.146 --> 01:24:14.647
MARISHA: (like Fjord) Eldritch Blast.

01:24:14.647 --> 01:24:19.286
MATT: As all of you are ushered past the metal
door, the guards all gather on the opposite side,

01:24:19.286 --> 01:24:28.459
and the lead guard of the unit goes, "Very well.
May the Platinum Dragon guide you." Closes the

01:24:28.459 --> 01:24:36.476
door and you hear the chains on the opposite side
being locked, as you all turn back, looking down

01:24:36.476 --> 01:24:41.346
the six or seven feet of descending stairs before
it levels into the double doors, partially opened

01:24:41.346 --> 01:24:44.437
and the darkness beyond. And that's where we're
going to take a quick break.

01:24:44.437 --> 01:24:47.121
SAM: Ah! Oh, but we were about to fight.

01:24:47.121 --> 01:24:51.191
MATT: Well, we're going to dive into that, just
because if we go into a battle, it might take a

01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:53.820
little while. We'll take the break now, before
that, and then we can dive into it immediately as

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.815
we return.

01:24:55.815 --> 01:24:57.147
LIAM: Let's try diplomacy.

01:24:57.147 --> 01:25:01.750
MATT: Perfect. Shiny blade balls are easy to talk
to.

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:03.316
MARISHA: Dear spinning death machine.

01:25:03.316 --> 01:25:07.375
TALIESIN: Fantasmagoria. I'm definitely having
some, yeah.

01:25:07.375 --> 01:25:11.280
MATT: All righty, guys. So, we'll be back here in
a few minutes, we're going to take a five or ten

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:17.293
minute break to get ourselves comfy, (like Rissa) "food,
water, and other releases of functions."

01:25:17.293 --> 01:25:19.254
MARISHA: Thanks, Rissa.

01:25:19.254 --> 01:25:24.103
MATT: And we'll see you guys here in just a
moment, so hang tight in the chat if you want to.

01:25:24.103 --> 01:25:29.233
We'll have a couple of fun videos to watch, and
once again, if you haven't seen the Kickstarter of

01:25:29.233 --> 01:25:34.887
these awesome minis, you can go to critrole.com
for all that information. They have the links

01:25:34.887 --> 01:25:37.830
there to the Kickstarter. The guys at Steamforged
have done an amazing job and we hope you like

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:39.450
them. All right, we'll see you here in a few
minutes.

01:25:40.685 --> 01:25:44.936
MATT: And welcome back. Wow.

01:25:44.935 --> 01:25:46.407
(laughter)

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:47.965
LIAM: Wow indeed.

01:25:47.965 --> 01:25:56.228
MATT: Indeed. So welcome back. Coming back into
the game. You have all descended down and reached

01:25:57.212 --> 01:26:03.127
the double doors, partially open, and stepped
quietly into the interior chamber of this sealed

01:26:03.127 --> 01:26:09.778
portion of the Gearhold Prison. There is what
looks like a faint flicker of those same

01:26:09.778 --> 01:26:16.496
ember-light torches that give off faint bits of
red glow, but a number the walls seem to have been

01:26:16.496 --> 01:26:21.940
damaged. Actually, as you step inside, you get a
quick look. The doors that are behind you and the

01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:32.950
walls around you are scraped and gashed from
hundreds and hundreds of blade marks. It looks

01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:40.613
like whatever in here has spent a lot of time
grinding around and looking of a means of escape

01:26:40.613 --> 01:26:45.673
or patrolling with its blades out over and over
again. Parts of the walls have fallen in a bit and

01:26:45.673 --> 01:26:50.288
there is rubble in areas where it's starting to
erode away the interior of this sealed chamber.

01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:54.693
But everywhere you look: to the right, left, and
along the ground all you see are hundreds and

01:26:54.693 --> 01:26:57.281
hundreds of blade-like grooves in the stone.

01:26:57.281 --> 01:27:00.495
SAM: That's not good.

01:27:00.495 --> 01:27:05.660
ASHLEY: This is as, you know, I've heard the kids
say these days: Creepy AF.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:11.766
TALIESIN: Actually, it's got eyes and not ears, I
don't think. When we saw the blueprints was there

01:27:11.766 --> 01:27:14.616
any way for it to detect sound or was it all
visual?

01:27:14.616 --> 01:27:19.729
MATT: Without your massive intelligence roll, you
weren't able to discern that information, unfortunately.

01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:20.788
TALIESIN: All right.

01:27:20.788 --> 01:27:28.049
MARISHA: (whispering) I'm going to assume yes. Hey
Jester! (cooing)

01:27:28.049 --> 01:27:29.801
TALIESIN: Let's pretend we're whispering.

01:27:29.801 --> 01:27:35.177
MARISHA: (cooing) Okay. Maybe Pass Without a
Trace, Jester? (cooing)

01:27:35.177 --> 01:27:39.748
TALIESIN: We can do that. Let's cast Pass Without
a Trace. I'm going to light up my sword.

01:27:39.748 --> 01:27:41.609
MATT: That is a 2nd-level spell, if I recall.

01:27:41.609 --> 01:27:43.784
TALIESIN: That would be our last 2nd-level spell.
Wait, let's--

01:27:43.784 --> 01:27:45.517
MARISHA: Maybe not.

01:27:45.517 --> 01:27:51.988
TALIESIN: Maybe not Pass Without a Trace, because
once it sees us it doesn't matter anymore.

01:27:51.988 --> 01:27:54.159
So let's not do that yet.

01:27:54.159 --> 01:27:55.402
MARISHA: Okay. Nevermind. Keep going.

01:27:55.402 --> 01:27:57.488
TALIESIN: I'm going to light up my swords.

01:27:57.488 --> 01:27:59.150
MATT: Both of them?

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:00.859
TALIESIN: Yeah, with ice.

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:01.887
MATT: Okay.

01:28:01.887 --> 01:28:15.409
TALIESIN: That brings me down to 49 hit points, so
that's fun. Wow, that’ll be a lot of fun. That's

01:28:15.409 --> 01:28:23.225
thrilling. There's a door over there. Do you want
to sneak over and see?

01:28:23.225 --> 01:28:28.037
SAM: Sure. I'll sneak over to the door and try to
unlock it.

01:28:28.037 --> 01:28:29.198
MATT: Over here?

01:28:29.198 --> 01:28:30.178
SAM: Or see if it's locked.

01:28:30.178 --> 01:28:34.942
MATT: All right. It is a set of prison bars. There
is a gate that is currently locked. The bars

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:40.347
themselves, once again, you can see rows and rows
of gashes and scrapes across the metal. They're

01:28:40.347 --> 01:28:46.348
bowed in a bit from impacts repeatedly. It's
slightly bent inward. You can attempt to pick a

01:28:46.348 --> 01:28:47.342
lock, if you'd like.

01:28:47.342 --> 01:28:48.397
SAM: I'll pick a lock.

01:28:48.397 --> 01:28:51.768
MATT: Go ahead and roll. That's proficiency bonus
plus dexterity.

01:28:51.768 --> 01:28:55.427
SAM: That's is a 14.

01:28:55.427 --> 01:29:02.281
MATT: A 14. (clicking) It's not triggering the
lock. These are not easy locks to get through.

01:29:02.281 --> 01:29:06.400
They're designed to hold prisoners, unfortunately,
so they're fairly hardy locks. You spend a while

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:09.798
with it and are unable to hit those tumblers. It
looks like it's not going to open. Make a

01:29:09.798 --> 01:29:12.496
perception check as you're looking through the
bars.

01:29:12.496 --> 01:29:14.124
SAM: Four.

01:29:14.124 --> 01:29:16.859
LIAM: I sneak up behind Nott.

01:29:16.859 --> 01:29:18.041
MATT: All right.

01:29:18.041 --> 01:29:23.862
LIAM: (whispering) I can open this if you need me
to. I just like to save my shit.

01:29:23.862 --> 01:29:28.187
SAM: I don't know what's in it. I can't see
anything through it, can I?

01:29:28.286 --> 01:29:34.578
MATT: Not with that perception roll, no. You see
bits of rock. You see some cloth on the ground, that's it.

01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:37.706
MARISHA: Caleb, maybe save your shit for
afterwards.

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:43.426
LIAM: Also if I were to unlock it, it would be
loud, so that's not good.

01:29:43.426 --> 01:29:47.608
TALIESIN: Can we put some light in there and maybe
take a look at what's in there?

01:29:47.608 --> 01:29:48.984
SAM: What's in that room?

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:52.447
TALIESIN: Yeah. Since we have an orb up, don't we?
No, we have a torch.

01:29:52.447 --> 01:29:55.008
MATT: Yasha, you have the torch right? No, Caleb
has the torch.

01:29:55.008 --> 01:30:00.188
TALIESIN: Caleb, you want to use the torch to take
a look in there, maybe? I'm keeping an eye through

01:30:00.188 --> 01:30:03.041
this hallway and I think I'm going to slowly start
scooting.

01:30:03.041 --> 01:30:04.194
MATT: Start scooting this way?

01:30:04.194 --> 01:30:06.926
TALIESIN: But against the wall.

01:30:06.926 --> 01:30:09.030
SAM: What an amazing mini.

01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:10.407
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:30:10.407 --> 01:30:14.496
MATT: Yeah. These are the painted prototypes to
give you a little bit of a glance of what these

01:30:14.496 --> 01:30:18.187
will look like. There are a few changes for the
final designs, of course, but these will give you

01:30:18.187 --> 01:30:24.167
an idea. All righty. There's Molly on that side.
Caleb, as you hold the torch up at the bars and

01:30:24.167 --> 01:30:29.149
look through, make a perception check with
advantage. As you're following off Nott's lead and

01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:33.309
it's small chamber, you can make out quite a bit
of detail.

01:30:33.309 --> 01:30:36.627
LIAM: Oh, that's good. 19.

01:30:36.627 --> 01:30:43.007
MATT: Good. Glancing inside, you see that whatever
scrape marks that mar the interior of this main

01:30:43.007 --> 01:30:52.221
chamber, there are none within this cell. Whatever
this creature, this Gearkeeper construct is, it

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:58.606
did not manage to breach these gates. However, on
the opposite side you see three different bed

01:30:58.606 --> 01:31:05.793
set-ups for prisoners. Some that seem, either they
were trying to claw their way out, or the impact

01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:10.577
of slamming on the other walls caused bits of it
to fall in and collapse. There are piles of stone

01:31:10.577 --> 01:31:17.331
and fallen earth on the other side. You see three
skeletons. They look like they've been decomposing

01:31:17.424 --> 01:31:21.324
for quite some time. Probably prisoners that
couldn't escape, and had no other way out.

01:31:21.324 --> 01:31:23.180
ASHLEY: That's sucks.

01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:24.708
SAM: That's rough.

01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:31.204
LIAM: Okay, we can check this off our list,
probably. There are some dead inmates in here.

01:31:31.204 --> 01:31:37.137
SAM: If the thing comes out here we're all dead so
we should probably figure out a way to stop it.

01:31:37.137 --> 01:31:39.728
TALIESIN: We can all get in that room if we have
to.

01:31:39.728 --> 01:31:42.012
SAM: All right, but I can't open it.

01:31:42.012 --> 01:31:46.636
MARISHA: Normally you don't want to get trapped in
a room with something bigger and spinning with

01:31:46.636 --> 01:31:52.612
12 blades. I think we'd be better off holding
this choke point.

01:31:53.106 --> 01:31:57.759
TALIESIN: That's the hope, but we have these other
options over here. Is there anything I can see

01:31:57.759 --> 01:32:00.655
from my perspective, from where I'm standing right
now?

01:32:00.655 --> 01:32:02.962
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:32:02.962 --> 01:32:09.036
TALIESIN: I knew you’d say that. That's a 16.

01:32:09.036 --> 01:32:15.568
MATT: Your dark vision is 60 feet correct? You can
just make out the details of another interior

01:32:15.568 --> 01:32:23.585
chamber. Looking within, portions of the walls
inside are also equally scraped apart. Edges of

01:32:23.585 --> 01:32:29.577
the fine, well-set stonework have been marred with
repeated gashes all over. It looks like beyond

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:34.031
that there was another prison cell, but those bars
have been breached, as they are currently bent,

01:32:34.031 --> 01:32:38.942
gnarled, and twisted and pulled out of place. The
cell beyond it appears to be open.

01:32:38.942 --> 01:32:44.991
MARISHA: I'm going to move up and go to the
opposite side of where Molly is and peek down the

01:32:44.991 --> 01:32:47.381
opposite way, just like he did.

01:32:47.381 --> 01:32:49.945
MATT: Anybody else moving anywhere?

01:32:49.945 --> 01:32:56.975
LIAM: While people are moving around the room I
whisper: Just for our options here. If we want to

01:32:56.975 --> 01:33:04.689
kick this off and don't mind getting its
attention, I can magically unlock this door here,

01:33:04.689 --> 01:33:12.403
which will make a sound, and then instantly lock
it. If we wanted to, we could all hustle inside

01:33:12.403 --> 01:33:16.631
here, and maybe attack at range? Just as an
option.

01:33:16.631 --> 01:33:19.635
SAM: Does the door have holes?

01:33:19.635 --> 01:33:22.849
MATT: The door is open but there are bars on
this.

01:33:22.849 --> 01:33:25.860
SAM: That's not a door, it's just a cage.

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:29.746
MATT: Yes, and it's partially bent inward from the
impact. It looks like it sustained quite a bit of

01:33:29.746 --> 01:33:33.959
brunt force to it over time.

01:33:33.959 --> 01:33:38.181
LAIM: That would put Beau and Yasha at a
disadvantage, but the rest of us could take pot

01:33:38.181 --> 01:33:39.924
shots at it from in here.

01:33:39.924 --> 01:33:47.585
MARISHA: You know, I like that idea. Maybe Yasha
and I can stand and hide and crouch in the corners

01:33:47.585 --> 01:33:53.040
while you guys get its attention and shoot it from
range. What I would be afraid of is if we were all

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:59.335
in there, and it eventually did what it did to
those bars over there, and busted in. And we were

01:33:59.335 --> 01:34:01.874
all sitting ducks on the inside.

01:34:01.874 --> 01:34:06.780
LIAM: Well I could be wrong, but with what I know
how to do, I don't think it can do that to this

01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:09.495
door, for a short amount of time.

01:34:09.495 --> 01:34:12.077
MARISHA: It looks like it--

01:34:12.077 --> 01:34:14.295
TALIESIN: Do you have a plan?

01:34:14.295 --> 01:34:18.068
LIAM: Well, I'm talking about magic. I can
magically seal this door. Unless it has a way to

01:34:18.068 --> 01:34:21.232
deal with that, it will not be able to get
through.

01:34:21.232 --> 01:34:26.002
SAM: That's pretty good. Let's move quickly,
though.

01:34:26.002 --> 01:34:29.178
MATT: Make an intelligence check, Caleb, if you
don't mind.

01:34:29.178 --> 01:34:33.938
LIAM: That is 15.

01:34:33.938 --> 01:34:41.280
MATT: 15. Okay. You were referring. I believe, to
the spell Arcane Lock, right?

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:52.301
LIAM: "Impassable until it is broken, or the spell
is dispelled or suppressed."

01:34:56.470 --> 01:35:03.170
MATT: Yep. It can still be forced open; it's just
a higher DC to do so. It's possible, but it makes

01:35:03.170 --> 01:35:05.206
it a much harder door to break through.

01:35:05.206 --> 01:35:05.999
LIAM: Okay.

01:35:05.999 --> 01:35:09.783
MATT: You have a valid point to what you're
saying, yes.

01:35:09.783 --> 01:35:13.550
MARISHA: Can I still complete my perception check
and see if I see down here?

01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:15.540
MATT: Go for it. Make a perception check.

01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:17.382
MARISHA: Not great. Seven.

01:35:17.382 --> 01:35:21.000
MATT: Seven? Unfortunately, even with your
darkvision, it's hard to look past that way. You

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:28.542
can see another chamber. At your current vantage
point, it's a little bit out of the way. It looks

01:35:28.542 --> 01:35:33.597
like there's not enough information. You'd have to
get a little closer to make out the details.

01:35:33.597 --> 01:35:40.112
MARISHA: Is there anything that would warrant a
couple people hiding while some people got in the

01:35:40.112 --> 01:35:46.783
thing? Is there something that looks like Yasha
and I could maybe hide? I'm a little disadvantage

01:35:46.783 --> 01:35:49.047
looking at this angle.

01:35:49.047 --> 01:35:52.679
MATT: There are some piles of rubble and portions
of the walls that have collapsed inwards.

01:35:52.679 --> 01:35:56.904
TALIESIN: So you can get up and get a little
height if you want and we can also--

01:35:56.904 --> 01:36:00.661
SAM: If we went inside that room, though--

01:36:00.661 --> 01:36:02.788
TALIESIN: Those with range.

01:36:02.788 --> 01:36:09.916
SAM: The creature would probably give up and go
back into hiding until we came out, I would assume.

01:36:10.388 --> 01:36:13.265
TALIESIN: Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it would keep
pounding until you died.

01:36:13.265 --> 01:36:15.724
MARISHA: You could still Mage Hand the tar between
the bars, right?

01:36:15.724 --> 01:36:16.798
SAM: Sure.

01:36:16.798 --> 01:36:17.863
MARISHA: Let's try it!

01:36:17.863 --> 01:36:20.452
TALIESIN: We don't even have to put the tar
inside, it could be outside.

01:36:20.452 --> 01:36:27.015
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying. Caleb, can you
lift that gate spell if we need to get back out?

01:36:27.015 --> 01:36:30.001
LIAM: Yeah, instantly.

01:36:30.001 --> 01:36:33.644
TALIESIN: All right, Yasha, we're going to be on
the outside, then?

01:36:33.644 --> 01:36:35.043
ASHLEY: Yep.

01:36:35.043 --> 01:36:37.321
SAM: That's scary and dangerous.

01:36:37.321 --> 01:36:38.800
TALIESIN: This is scary and dangerous work.

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.341
MARISHA: Wait, are you and Yasha going to be on
the outside?

01:36:40.341 --> 01:36:41.711
TALIESIN: Well, we don't have any range.

01:36:41.711 --> 01:36:43.828
MARISHA: Neither do I.

01:36:43.828 --> 01:36:46.503
TALIESIN: You're going to be on the outside too. I
thought we'd put all the ranged people in there

01:36:46.503 --> 01:36:50.323
and draw its attention to attack them, and then
while it's there we can all gang up on it.

01:36:50.323 --> 01:36:52.695
ASHLEY: Three Amigos?

01:36:52.695 --> 01:36:57.420
SAM: It's a terrible idea, but go for it.

01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:59.001
MATT: So, what are you guys doing?

01:36:59.001 --> 01:37:03.025
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it.

01:37:03.025 --> 01:37:06.309
LIAM: So you bruisers, you're staying out here?

01:37:06.309 --> 01:37:10.329
MARISHA: But we're going to hide amongst this
rubble on the opposite side and you guys are going to start.

01:37:10.869 --> 01:37:12.701
MATT: Yasha, where are you moving to?

01:37:12.701 --> 01:37:14.799
ASHLEY: We're going to hide behind the rubble.

01:37:14.799 --> 01:37:15.689
MATT: Right here?

01:37:15.689 --> 01:37:17.640
ASHLEY: And Beau as well.

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.747
MATT: Beau, you're moving over here as well?

01:37:18.747 --> 01:37:23.419
MARISHA: Yeah. Can I get up on top of the rubble
and crouch down?

01:37:23.419 --> 01:37:25.764
TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt to hide in the
corner.

01:37:25.764 --> 01:37:34.983
MATT: It's going to be hard to hide and climb it
as well. We can do about there, as good as we can get, there.

01:37:35.742 --> 01:37:38.475
TALIESIN: Oh, Yasha, before I forget, I got you
something.

01:37:38.475 --> 01:37:39.473
ASHLEY: You did?

01:37:39.473 --> 01:37:44.658
TALIESIN: I hand her one of the silk flowers from
the festival. It doesn't press well, but, you know.

01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:49.832
ASHLEY: It is going to be very special. Thank you,
Molly.

01:37:49.832 --> 01:37:52.400
TALIESIN: Got for you if we live.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.380
MATT: Molly, are you staying there?

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:55.765
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm going to stay super crouched.

01:37:55.765 --> 01:37:57.380
SAM: Does Jester have her Spiritual Weapon out?

01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.292
MATT: She doesn't yet.

01:37:59.292 --> 01:38:01.968
SAM: Okay. Maybe we should get it ready.

01:38:01.968 --> 01:38:03.240
LIAM: Wait.

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.635
SAM: Wait, what?

01:38:04.635 --> 01:38:12.185
LIAM: I do not have the components I need for
Arcane Lock. Damn it.

01:38:12.185 --> 01:38:13.819
MARISHA: What do you need?

01:38:13.819 --> 01:38:16.833
LIAM: A lot of gold dust.

01:38:16.833 --> 01:38:19.376
MARISHA: A lot of gold dust?

01:38:19.376 --> 01:38:21.301
SAM: We can make some, right now!

01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:26.957
MARISHA: I know! Can we grind some gold really
fast? File some?

01:38:26.957 --> 01:38:28.450
SAM: Quietly!

01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:31.452
MARISHA: Quietly file down gold coins?

01:38:31.452 --> 01:38:34.753
SAM: All right, well, plan B.

01:38:34.753 --> 01:38:36.754
ASHLEY: Plan B. That's fine.

01:38:36.754 --> 01:38:40.473
SAM: Do you want me to scout ahead to the area
that you've seen?

01:38:40.473 --> 01:38:41.770
TALIESIN: Or the cat.

01:38:41.770 --> 01:38:48.172
SAM: Or the cat, yes. How about the cat goes to
the area where Molly has seen. Which, Liam, for

01:38:48.172 --> 01:38:53.345
you, is the bottom left of the picture I sent
you.

01:38:53.345 --> 01:38:57.149
MATT: So where are you sending Frumpkin?

01:38:57.149 --> 01:39:01.019
LIAM: Into the last unexplored room.

01:39:01.019 --> 01:39:03.346
SAM: No, this is the one that--

01:39:03.346 --> 01:39:04.721
TALIESIN: The first unexplored room.

01:39:04.721 --> 01:39:09.085
SAM: The first explored room, that Molly has seen
a little bit of.

01:39:09.085 --> 01:39:12.372
LIAM, Sorry. I was looking at my spellbook and not
paying attention to you lot. What were you

01:39:12.372 --> 01:39:14.650
hoping me to do?

01:39:14.650 --> 01:39:15.845
SAM: Send the cat.

01:39:15.845 --> 01:39:17.288
TALIESIN: Sending the cat to take a look--

01:39:17.288 --> 01:39:19.884
MARISHA: Scout with the cat. Kitty scout.

01:39:19.884 --> 01:39:21.615
TALIESIN: This may be the end of the cat.

01:39:21.615 --> 01:39:29.355
LIAM: Yeah, okay. I'm going to back as far away
from that door as I can, and I will send Frumpkin in.

01:39:29.355 --> 01:39:34.067
MATT: Moving back in the corner with Beau and
Yasha. Right about there, we'll say.

01:39:34.067 --> 01:39:35.323
LIAM: Ladies.

01:39:35.323 --> 01:39:39.113
MATT: You begin to focus and Frumpkin heads to the
right side of the fork into the chamber you've

01:39:39.113 --> 01:39:46.279
already looked into, towards the open cell doors
that are currently pried off that archway. As

01:39:46.279 --> 01:39:48.826
Frumpkin glances past, make a stealth check for
Frumpkin.

01:39:48.826 --> 01:40:01.377
LIAM: Yep. Oh. I don't have the cat paper with me
in this state that I'm in, because I didn't know

01:40:01.377 --> 01:40:02.880
I'd be playing.

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:03.982
MATT: That's okay.

01:40:03.982 --> 01:40:05.751
LIAM: So I rolled a 15.

01:40:05.751 --> 01:40:07.345
MATT: Rolled a 15? Okay.

01:40:07.345 --> 01:40:09.295
LIAM. Yeah. Let's go with that.

01:40:09.295 --> 01:40:11.129
TALIESIN: 15 plus cat.

01:40:11.129 --> 01:40:17.035
MATT: All right. Frumpkin glances inside this
busted cell and sees-- what I’m using as an

01:40:17.035 --> 01:40:28.091
interpretation of-- a large spherical metal object
that's about eight feet diameter on any side. It

01:40:28.091 --> 01:40:35.039
looks like a series of overlapping metal plates
that look clustered together at odd angles.

01:40:35.039 --> 01:40:40.294
Elements of it look scraped and dented. It looks
like it's been doing some serious damage to it

01:40:40.294 --> 01:40:48.825
over time. As it sits there, resting, and Frumpkin
approaches, you watch one of the tiny little metal

01:40:48.825 --> 01:41:00.821
plates (squeak) open, a lens pokes out towards
Frumpkin, withdraws back in. The plate closes and

01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:08.916
about six of these long blade-like spider legs
stick out of it as it pulls back and begins to

01:41:08.916 --> 01:41:11.914
roll forward at a very extreme pace.

01:41:11.914 --> 01:41:14.854
LIAM: I snap Frumpkin out of there.

01:41:14.854 --> 01:41:19.087
MATT: It rolls forward. Frumpkin just manages to
bamf out of this dimension as the object slams

01:41:19.087 --> 01:41:25.357
into the opposite wall. You guys feel the entire
chamber suddenly (crash) from the impact and you

01:41:25.357 --> 01:41:29.278
hear this scraping of metal in the distance.

01:41:29.278 --> 01:41:32.657
SAM: I'm going to re-cast Mage Hand and pick up
the bucket of tar.

01:41:32.657 --> 01:41:41.200
MATT: It rolls across the way and disappears into
the other chamber.

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.539
MARISHA: I'm going to stealthily move forward,
back where I was across from Molly.

01:41:46.539 --> 01:41:48.051
MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check, please.

01:41:48.051 --> 01:41:50.697
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. This just got really--

01:41:50.697 --> 01:41:52.227
TALIESIN: I have an interesting idea.

01:41:52.227 --> 01:41:53.618
MATT: Nott, where do you want to go?

01:41:53.618 --> 01:41:58.539
SAM: Towards the narrower hallway.

01:41:58.539 --> 01:41:59.760
MATT: Here?

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:06.475
SAM: Yeah, just on the edge of it. Do I hear any
movement or anything?

01:42:06.475 --> 01:42:09.254
MATT: You do hear the same object shifting on the
other side.

01:42:09.254 --> 01:42:10.075
MARISHA: 15.

01:42:10.075 --> 01:42:13.297
MATT: 15? Okay.

01:42:13.297 --> 01:42:14.574
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:42:14.574 --> 01:42:19.707
MATT: Nott, as you're there at the edge, and
Beau's there. You glance in, now that you guys are

01:42:19.707 --> 01:42:23.082
close enough you can see shifting in there. You
pay attention and you can see this other chamber

01:42:23.082 --> 01:42:32.504
is open with another cell off to the side. It
slams into that door, spins around, and one of the

01:42:32.504 --> 01:42:38.506
lenses peeks around the corner right at where Beau
had just moved into the far corner.

01:42:38.506 --> 01:42:48.148
TALIESIN: Jester is going to cast her Spiritual
Weapon and put it right in the center of--

01:42:48.148 --> 01:42:50.391
SAM: The room?

01:42:50.391 --> 01:42:54.201
TALIESIN: Yeah. A big nice shiny object to
distract.

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:56.919
MATT: Where's Fjord going? Because we're about to
go into combat.

01:42:56.919 --> 01:42:58.864
TALIESIN: Are we all pulling against the walls?

01:42:58.864 --> 01:43:09.952
MARISHA: Where is Fjord going? Make Fjord go by
the gate, maybe. Back a bit. Then Beau is going to

01:43:09.952 --> 01:43:13.207
take out those ball bearings.

01:43:13.207 --> 01:43:16.250
ASHLEY: Can we put Jester in the corner?

01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:17.814
MATT: Jester can back up there.

01:43:17.814 --> 01:43:21.155
MARISHA: Let's not kill our friends’ D&amp;amp;D
characters.

01:43:21.155 --> 01:43:22.827
MATT: I need all of you to roll initiative.

01:43:22.827 --> 01:43:29.043
MARISHA: If we still have a bit of an action, I'm
going to toss my bag of ball bearings and try and

01:43:29.043 --> 01:43:31.638
throw a bunch of ball bearings right here.

01:43:31.638 --> 01:43:34.324
LIAM: Sam, can you take a new picture and send it
to me?

01:43:34.324 --> 01:43:40.748
MATT: You throw the ball bearings out clattering.
As that happens, the legs, which are still out,

01:43:40.748 --> 01:43:46.075
rear backward and they retract as it runs itself
rolling forward in your direction, ricocheting off

01:43:46.075 --> 01:43:55.514
that wall. The ball bearings, as it grinds across
the bottom, get fired off like small impact

01:43:55.514 --> 01:44:02.214
bullets from the grinding of the metal plates and
the force of it hitting. I need both Nott and Beau

01:44:02.214 --> 01:44:03.950
to make dexterity saving throws.

01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:09.635
SAM: Oh god! Save? 21.

01:44:09.635 --> 01:44:12.050
MATT: 21.

01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:14.733
MARISHA: Oh wait, not with advantage, or no?

01:44:14.733 --> 01:44:15.948
MATT: Not with advantage. Just a single roll.

01:44:15.948 --> 01:44:17.810
MARISHA: Okay, 18 then.

01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:21.924
MATT: You guys both manage to just duck out of the
way, they don't seem to hit you. It's only a

01:44:21.924 --> 01:44:26.302
handful of them that upon the impact of it hitting
stone and being pressured beneath, they shoot off

01:44:26.302 --> 01:44:28.010
in your direction.

01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:31.038
MARISHA: Molly, ball bearings didn't work! Rolling
for initiative?

01:44:31.038 --> 01:44:41.395
MATT: Initiative rolls, guys. Roll for yourself,
Beau, and then roll for Jester and Fjord as well.

01:44:41.395 --> 01:44:43.136
TALIESIN: I'll roll for Jester.

01:44:43.136 --> 01:44:47.570
MARISHA: I'm rolling for Fjord.

01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:49.422
MATT: 25 to 20?

01:44:49.422 --> 01:44:50.957
MARISHA: Hang on.

01:44:50.957 --> 01:44:53.298
TALIESIN: So fucked.

01:44:53.298 --> 01:44:58.470
MARISHA: Sorry. Another person's character.

01:44:58.470 --> 01:45:03.206
MATT: 25 to 20 anybody? 20 to 15?

01:45:03.206 --> 01:45:06.096
ASHLEY: 19.

01:45:06.096 --> 01:45:07.948
SAM: Whoa! Who are you?

01:45:07.948 --> 01:45:11.747
ASHLEY: I don’t know! But I don't know what to do
this early on.

01:45:11.747 --> 01:45:13.151
TALIESIN: It's going to be a lot of dodging.

01:45:13.151 --> 01:45:15.818
MATT: 15 to ten?

01:45:15.818 --> 01:45:20.295
MARISHA: Fjord is 14. Beau is ten.

01:45:20.295 --> 01:45:28.441
MATT: All right. Ten to five?

01:45:28.441 --> 01:45:30.179
SAM: Seven.

01:45:30.179 --> 01:45:32.235
LIAM: Six.

01:45:32.235 --> 01:45:38.390
TALIESIN: Seven for me as well. And Jester is
six.

01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:42.097
MATT: Caleb and Jester are in the same--

01:45:42.097 --> 01:45:44.577
SAM: Caleb and Jester are six, Molly and Nott are
both seven.

01:45:44.577 --> 01:45:50.301
MATT: Seven, got it! Top of the round, as you see
it come riding and curve around the corner and

01:45:50.301 --> 01:45:56.961
slam into that wall, the stone bends inward even
further and bits of the masonry flake and fall off

01:45:56.961 --> 01:46:03.051
to the ground, clattering and small bits of stone.
It turns, and you can see now the six spider-like

01:46:03.051 --> 01:46:09.146
blade legs sticking out of it. Six more shoot out
of the top of it, and all begin whirling around

01:46:09.146 --> 01:46:16.765
and begin spinning. There, amongst this chaos, you
see the lens sitting right there, just barely

01:46:16.765 --> 01:46:21.549
peeking through its armored shell. Yasha, you're
up first.

01:46:21.549 --> 01:46:28.017
ASHLEY: Okay, I would like to rage.

01:46:28.017 --> 01:46:29.641
MATT: All righty.

01:46:29.641 --> 01:46:42.517
ASHLEY: It's the time. Do I just go in?

01:46:42.517 --> 01:46:44.545
SAM: This is it.

01:46:44.545 --> 01:46:47.628
ASHLEY: Can I get to it?

01:46:47.628 --> 01:46:53.689
MATT: (counting) You just barely get into its
range with your barbarian speed. You rush in,

01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:57.884
anger on your face. You draw your Magician's Judge
blade in the air.

01:46:57.884 --> 01:47:02.304
ASHLEY: Oh no.

01:47:02.304 --> 01:47:04.697
TALIESIN: Do you have advantage?

01:47:04.697 --> 01:47:08.401
ASHLEY: I didn't reckless. 11.

01:47:08.401 --> 01:47:12.758
MATT: 11, unfortunately, does not hit. Your blade
scrapes across its armored exterior, not finding

01:47:12.758 --> 01:47:14.670
purchase in any of its innards.

01:47:14.670 --> 01:47:17.472
ASHLEY: Divine Fury, can you do it on the first or
only if the first--

01:47:17.728 --> 01:47:18.956
MATT: The first attack that hits.

01:47:18.956 --> 01:47:19.860
ASHLEY: That first attack that hits.

01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:21.200
MATT: Correct.

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.378
ASHLEY: Can I use my extra attack?

01:47:24.378 --> 01:47:27.058
MATT: Yeah, you get that every round.

01:47:27.058 --> 01:47:32.799
ASHLEY: That’s better. That’s 21.

01:47:32.799 --> 01:47:35.988
MATT: 21 hits! Roll damage.

01:47:35.988 --> 01:47:39.284
SAM: This is it.

01:47:39.284 --> 01:47:41.318
TALIESIN: We’re so fucked.

01:47:41.318 --> 01:47:44.320
SAM: Kick it in the ball!

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:49.722
ASHLEY: Okay! 12.

01:47:52.147 --> 01:47:58.218
MATT: You roll 2d6 for the weapon, 3d6 for the
Divine Fury. Oh no, it’s additional half your level.

01:47:58.218 --> 01:48:03.927
ASHLEY: Yeah. Plus three. It’s 2d6 plus three.

01:48:03.927 --> 01:48:05.265
MATT: 2d6 plus three, right?

01:48:05.265 --> 01:48:06.957
ASHLEY: Yeah. So 12.

01:48:06.957 --> 01:48:08.750
MATT: 12, and then your rage damage, which is
two.

01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:11.667
ASHLEY: Oh right! Yeah, 14.

01:48:11.667 --> 01:48:14.018
TALIESIN: Is it Divine Fury still?

01:48:14.018 --> 01:48:15.692
ASHLEY: No, because that’s only the first.

01:48:15.692 --> 01:48:18.362
MATT: Well no, it’s the first attack that hit.
That’s what I’m saying. You get Divine Fury for

01:48:18.362 --> 01:48:20.687
this hit because your first one hit, this one does
get it.

01:48:20.687 --> 01:48:28.567
ASHLEY: Okay! So an extra d6. Oops. Okay, an extra
two. So 16 total.

01:48:28.567 --> 01:48:30.925
MATT: Okay. With that--

01:48:30.925 --> 01:48:32.433
SAM: Clang!

01:48:32.433 --> 01:48:36.371
MATT: The first strikes off. The second one you
bring down. The blade carves down and one of its

01:48:36.371 --> 01:48:42.934
metal arms bends off to the side. The blade digs
into the gears. Yasha’s blade finds its way in.

01:48:42.934 --> 01:48:47.789
Sparks go streaking off and the blade gets
jettisoned off. You have to hold it before it gets

01:48:47.789 --> 01:48:53.023
shot off the side of it, the clockwork pushing it
out of its innards. The armor plate clicks over

01:48:53.023 --> 01:48:54.400
and guards its space.

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.636
ASHLEY: Okay. I’ll stay.

01:48:57.636 --> 01:48:59.072
TALIESIN: Did it lose a blade just now?

01:48:59.072 --> 01:49:04.197
MATT: It looks like it’s bent back a bit. That
ends Yasha’s turn. Fjord is up next.

01:49:04.197 --> 01:49:05.637
SAM: Yeah, Fjord!

01:49:05.637 --> 01:49:08.532
MARISHA: Fjord’s going to cast Hex!

01:49:08.532 --> 01:49:10.978
TALIESIN: Hex, ma’am!

01:49:10.978 --> 01:49:13.155
MARISHA: I’m going to Hex that "robit."

01:49:13.155 --> 01:49:14.595
TALIESIN: Hex the "robit."

01:49:14.595 --> 01:49:19.708
MATT: The "robit" is a-hexed.

01:49:19.708 --> 01:49:27.686
MARISHA: Hang on, wait. That doesn’t-- no. It
doesn’t mess with Armor of Agathys, just checking.

01:49:27.686 --> 01:49:30.994
MATT: You have a concentration on Fjord for this.

01:49:30.994 --> 01:49:39.638
MARISHA: This is Hex. Then he’s going to take his
falchion, he’s going to flip it, and from the

01:49:39.638 --> 01:49:45.218
hilt, he’s going to go (firing). He’s going to
cast Eldritch Blast because I saw him do that once before.

01:49:45.218 --> 01:49:47.238
MATT: Like a from-the-hip-shotgun. I like it.

01:49:47.238 --> 01:49:50.965
MARISHA: He did it before. I’m ripping it off from
Travis.

01:49:50.965 --> 01:49:53.181
MATT: That’s two shots. Fire twice.

01:49:53.181 --> 01:49:59.494
MARISHA: Pew pew! 15? Seven plus eight.

01:49:59.494 --> 01:50:04.649
MATT: Seven plus eight, 15? You fire, the blast
hits and disperses against the armor. It does not hit.

01:50:04.649 --> 01:50:13.238
MARISHA: Right, that magic shit. He’s going to try
it one more time. That bounced. Okay, that’s

01:50:13.238 --> 01:50:15.361
better. 13 plus seven.

01:50:15.361 --> 01:50:25.253
MATT: 20? 20 does hit. Roll a d10 plus four plus
another d6 for Hex. Not a d4, plus four damage to

01:50:25.253 --> 01:50:26.768
whatever you roll on the d10.

01:50:26.768 --> 01:50:37.928
MARISHA: I’m sorry. Me don’t know how. Six, sorry.
Five plus four is nine damage.

01:50:37.928 --> 01:50:40.017
SAM: Plus three from?

01:50:40.017 --> 01:50:44.021
MARISHA: No, that’s it. I rolled a three and a two
plus a four. It’s not a lot of damage. I rolled crappy.

01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:49.070
MATT: The second one does manage to pierce some of
its armor. Within the interior of it, there’s a

01:50:49.070 --> 01:50:53.953
flash of green on the inside. You see it curl
around from the interior, looking like cracks in

01:50:53.953 --> 01:50:59.124
the armor are suddenly glowing and then no more.
That finishes Fjord’s action and bonus action.

01:50:59.124 --> 01:51:01.032
MARISHA: What did you roll to hit?

01:51:01.032 --> 01:51:02.642
ASHLEY: Say again?

01:51:02.972 --> 01:51:04.544
MARISHA: What did you roll to hit?

01:51:04.544 --> 01:51:05.885
ASHLEY: Rolled a 21.

01:51:05.885 --> 01:51:07.630
MARISHA: 21. So we know 20 hits.

01:51:07.630 --> 01:51:08.912
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:51:08.912 --> 01:51:11.890
MARISHA: Now, Beauregard--

01:51:11.890 --> 01:51:13.637
MATT: Is Fjord going to stay where he is?

01:51:13.637 --> 01:51:20.407
MARISHA: Yes, because I’m scared. Beau is going
to--

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:23.039
MATT: Beau doesn’t go yet because it’s now the
Gearkeeper’s turn.

01:51:23.039 --> 01:51:25.063
MARISHA: I’m sorry.

01:51:25.063 --> 01:51:26.019
MATT: That’s okay.

01:51:26.019 --> 01:51:26.771
MARISHA: I didn’t know.

01:51:26.771 --> 01:51:27.701
MATT: That’s all right.

01:51:27.701 --> 01:51:29.621
SAM: The Gearkeeper.

01:51:29.621 --> 01:51:38.075
MATT: Beginning of its turn, it’s going to attempt
to roll over Yasha to go into the chamber. Yasha,

01:51:38.075 --> 01:51:40.932
you need to make an athletics or acrobatics
check.

01:51:40.932 --> 01:51:43.560
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.919
MATT: You’re raging, so you have advantage on your
acrobatics check.

01:51:45.919 --> 01:51:48.503
TALIESIN: That athletics is already sweet,
though.

01:51:48.503 --> 01:51:55.167
ASHLEY: Oof. Oh. Nine.

01:51:55.167 --> 01:51:59.225
MATT: No. First off, you suffer--

01:51:59.225 --> 01:52:02.432
ASHLEY: I rolled the wrong ones.

01:52:02.432 --> 01:52:08.313
MATT: Seven points of piercing damage as it rolls
over and the blades kick into you.

01:52:08.313 --> 01:52:10.724
ASHLEY: Is that halved because I’m raging?

01:52:10.724 --> 01:52:14.024
MATT: It is halved. An additional three points of
bludgeoning damage as you are crushed beneath its

01:52:14.024 --> 01:52:15.961
weight, and you are knocked prone.

01:52:15.961 --> 01:52:21.292
ASHLEY: That’s a total of-- you said three and--
I’m sorry.

01:52:21.292 --> 01:52:24.079
MATT: It was seven before three. So it’ll be ten
halved, so you take five points of damage.

01:52:24.079 --> 01:52:25.521
ASHLEY: Five points of damage, okay.

01:52:25.521 --> 01:52:37.711
MATT: It does roll past here, stopping at this
point. It’d be about here, I think. As it spins in

01:52:37.711 --> 01:52:43.666
this direction, the things that drew its attention
originally, which is Beau and Nott in that corner.

01:52:43.666 --> 01:52:46.356
Nott, you do get an attack of opportunity with a
melee weapon, if you have one, but you

01:52:46.356 --> 01:52:47.781
have your crossbow out?

01:52:47.781 --> 01:52:49.419
SAM: I probably have my crossbow out.

01:52:49.419 --> 01:52:51.406
MATT: So yeah, you don’t do much of an attack
there.

01:52:51.406 --> 01:52:54.203
SAM: I’ll hit it with my crossbow.

01:52:54.203 --> 01:52:57.171
MATT: Roll an attack. Improvised weapon for a
melee.

01:52:57.171 --> 01:52:59.754
SAM: Yeah. 18.

01:52:59.754 --> 01:53:02.262
MATT: 18 just hits.

01:53:02.262 --> 01:53:05.676
MARISHA: 18 is what hits, y’all!

01:53:05.676 --> 01:53:07.639
SAM: Do I get a point of damage?

01:53:07.639 --> 01:53:09.341
MATT: You get a point of damage on it.

01:53:09.341 --> 01:53:12.429
SAM: Yeah! Eat it!

01:53:12.429 --> 01:53:15.639
MATT: Your hand crossbow, as you slam into it, you
look back and it looks like some of the wood is

01:53:15.639 --> 01:53:21.198
splintered somewhat. You’re like, "Oh." It’s not
enough to the point where it looks like it’s not

01:53:21.198 --> 01:53:24.388
going to function, maybe, but it’s going to need
some repairs.

01:53:24.388 --> 01:53:27.677
SAM: I need a new crossbow, is what I need.

01:53:27.677 --> 01:53:32.477
MATT: Well, there you go. As it turns around, the
front of it, where the lens is, the lens retracts

01:53:32.477 --> 01:53:40.801
in. The plates in front suddenly open, leaving
this open, black, vacuous space, like a mouth or a

01:53:40.801 --> 01:53:49.130
gate, opens in front. You hear this very high,
whirring, winding sound. You see sparks inside,

01:53:49.130 --> 01:53:56.161
and a blast of heated shrapnel shoots outward in a
30 foot spray.

01:53:56.161 --> 01:53:58.632
SAM: It can do that?!

01:53:58.632 --> 01:54:01.137
MATT: Against both of you, right there.

01:54:01.137 --> 01:54:03.236
SAM: Cleff, you madman.

01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:07.197
MATT: I need you both to make a dexterity saving
throw, please.

01:54:07.825 --> 01:54:09.565
SAM: Oh, rough. 12.

01:54:09.565 --> 01:54:11.991
MARISHA: That’s not too bad. 22.

01:54:11.991 --> 01:54:14.006
MATT: Success, so you take half damage.

01:54:14.006 --> 01:54:15.959
MARISHA: Okay.

01:54:16.284 --> 01:54:22.243
MATT: That is 25 points of piercing damage to you
Nott.

01:54:22.243 --> 01:54:26.354
SAM: Because I hit it with my thing, do I no
longer have a reaction?

01:54:26.354 --> 01:54:27.061
MATT: Correct.

01:54:27.061 --> 01:54:30.073
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:54:30.073 --> 01:54:31.965
MATT: Now you know about the reactions.

01:54:31.965 --> 01:54:34.001
ASHLEY: 25 points of damage?

01:54:34.001 --> 01:54:36.665
MATT: Of piercing damage, and halved for you, so
you take 12.

01:54:36.665 --> 01:54:38.328
MARISHA: 12.

01:54:38.328 --> 01:54:46.604
MATT: Its shrapnel blast is done. That’s the end
of its turn. That brings us to Beau. You’re up.

01:54:46.604 --> 01:54:58.590
MARISHA: Okay. Being hit with hot shrapnel, I’m
going to do a cool pole vault over Nott.

01:54:58.590 --> 01:55:00.985
MATT: Over this way?

01:55:00.985 --> 01:55:07.725
MARISHA: I guess. Wait, where’s Yasha? Yasha’s
here?

01:55:07.725 --> 01:55:09.194
MATT: Yasha’s prone on the ground.

01:55:09.194 --> 01:55:11.739
MARISHA: I’ll get on the other side of where Yasha
will eventually be.

01:55:11.739 --> 01:55:12.796
MATT: Oh, so around here?

01:55:12.796 --> 01:55:14.279
MARISHA: Uh-huh. On this side of it.

01:55:14.279 --> 01:55:15.538
MATT: You’re moving into melee?

01:55:15.538 --> 01:55:16.455
MARISHA: Yep.

01:55:16.455 --> 01:55:17.312
MATT: Got it.

01:55:17.312 --> 01:55:19.004
MARISHA: Then attack!

01:55:19.004 --> 01:55:20.639
MATT: Go for it.

01:55:20.639 --> 01:55:24.587
MARISHA: Whack it with my stick. I’m going to try
and jam it up in between one of those gears.

01:55:24.587 --> 01:55:27.650
TALIESIN: You also have the mouth you can throw
the tar up in there.

01:55:27.650 --> 01:55:32.105
MARISHA: That’s terrible. That doesn’t hit, that’s
like, ten.

01:55:32.105 --> 01:55:35.971
MATT: Ten misses. The first strike with your staff
just scrapes off of its armor, no impact.

01:55:35.971 --> 01:55:42.408
MARISHA: I’m going to readjust and try and go for
it again. That’s the exact same roll. Those are

01:55:42.408 --> 01:55:44.715
two twos in a row.

01:55:44.715 --> 01:55:48.083
MATT: The second one, you strike again. This time,
one of the blades swings outward, and thankfully,

01:55:48.083 --> 01:55:52.626
the blade doesn’t hit the staff to cut the wood,
however, it does, the backhand, impact it and

01:55:52.626 --> 01:55:54.879
prevent the blow from actually striking its body.

01:55:54.879 --> 01:55:56.159
MARISHA: Two twos.

01:55:56.159 --> 01:55:57.702
MATT: That’s not fun.

01:55:57.702 --> 01:56:01.600
MARISHA: I guess I will do an unarmed attack.

01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:05.901
MATT: You go and punch the armored sphere.

01:56:05.901 --> 01:56:11.304
MARISHA: So frustrated that I can’t get my staff
up there, I’m just going to go and try and whack

01:56:11.304 --> 01:56:13.074
it with my fist.

01:56:13.074 --> 01:56:15.688
MATT: Go for it.

01:56:15.688 --> 01:56:17.399
MARISHA: 17, which just misses.

01:56:17.399 --> 01:56:25.245
MATT: It just misses. Well, not so much a miss.
You hit it, but you go (metallic clang), "Oh!" You

01:56:25.245 --> 01:56:27.993
can feel that from the knuckles right to the funny
bone.

01:56:27.993 --> 01:56:29.901
MARISHA: Do I have any more movement?

01:56:29.901 --> 01:56:36.053
MATT: From there, you have ten feet.

01:56:36.453 --> 01:56:41.833
MARISHA: Can I back up towards, or even get this--
I’m just going to stay where I am.

01:56:41.833 --> 01:56:44.225
MATT: Okay. Finishing Beau’s turn, that brings us
to Nott and Molly--

01:56:44.225 --> 01:56:50.459
MARISHA: Oh wait, hang on, as a bonus act-- no. I
used my bonus action. Fuck. Okay, keep going.

01:56:50.459 --> 01:56:55.276
SAM: Is its lens out?

01:56:55.276 --> 01:57:00.101
MATT: Its lens appears to be out currently, just
surveying the scenario, yes.

01:57:00.101 --> 01:57:01.546
SAM: So go for the lens?

01:57:01.546 --> 01:57:02.422
TALIESIN: Go for it.

01:57:02.422 --> 01:57:08.943
SAM: Bonus action, I will use the Mage Hand to
deliver the tar right on that lens.

01:57:08.943 --> 01:57:12.548
MATT: I’ll say, for the purposes of aiming on
this, with your intention, go ahead and make a d20

01:57:12.548 --> 01:57:17.201
attack roll adding your perception bonus.

01:57:17.201 --> 01:57:22.861
SAM: There is no bonus to that. Well that’s-- how
do you feel about that? Well, it fell so we’ll

01:57:22.861 --> 01:57:25.487
never know what it was. 17!

01:57:25.487 --> 01:57:28.778
MATT: 17! I’ll say, for the purposes of that,
because it’s not armor you’re trying to strike

01:57:28.778 --> 01:57:35.299
through, it’s just trying to aim for a position,
that will be enough. The tar, with a toss,

01:57:35.299 --> 01:57:43.304
(splashing) all across the lens. You see the
sticky, still warm, thick tar spray onto it, and

01:57:43.304 --> 01:57:47.684
get inside the interior of its armor for the
moment. The lens starts (swift movements), and you

01:57:47.684 --> 01:57:51.920
hear what previously was, now that it’s close to
you, you can hear there’s hundreds and hundreds of

01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:57.342
small clicks and winding sounds on the inside.
There’s now a rapid (zipping movements) as the

01:57:57.342 --> 01:57:59.987
lens is trying to find some sort of direction. It
is currently blinded.

01:57:59.987 --> 01:58:01.710
(cheering)

01:58:01.710 --> 01:58:07.030
SAM: Our plan worked perfectly. How far am I from
the thing?

01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:09.089
MATT: Technically, you are ten feet from it.

01:58:09.089 --> 01:58:11.436
SAM: Do you think I’m in melee range?

01:58:11.436 --> 01:58:13.006
TALIESIN: Probably.

01:58:13.006 --> 01:58:16.363
MATT: The blades have a bit of reach, so you are
technically in melee.

01:58:16.363 --> 01:58:17.907
TALIESIN: That’s a ten-foot blade reach.

01:58:17.907 --> 01:58:22.189
SAM: Can I use my action to disengage?

01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:27.047
MATT: You can use your action to disengage, yeah.
Disengage generally is an action.

01:58:27.047 --> 01:58:31.942
SAM: Okay. I will disengage and run.

01:58:31.942 --> 01:58:33.778
MATT: Which direction?

01:58:33.778 --> 01:58:36.120
SAM: Straight to the place I just came from.

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:41.422
MATT: All right. You can get there. You can go one
more, if you want to.

01:58:41.422 --> 01:58:42.521
SAM: Sure.

01:58:42.521 --> 01:58:45.983
MATT: All right, there you go. You can still keep
it in your visual range, but that’s 30 feet back.

01:58:45.983 --> 01:58:51.062
Now you spin around with your crossbow, not
suffering any attack of opportunity. All right, Molly.

01:58:51.062 --> 01:58:55.153
TALIESIN: Can I see anywhere where there seems to
be a crack in the armor and make a--

01:58:55.153 --> 01:58:59.926
MATT: You may, yes. Well, you can try and
inspect.

01:58:59.926 --> 01:59:05.603
TALIESIN: I want to see if there’s anything that
looks like a good target to start doing some

01:59:05.603 --> 01:59:07.068
damage to.

01:59:07.068 --> 01:59:11.213
MATT: At the moment, it hasn’t taken a lot of
damage, and it’s hard to see if any--

01:59:11.213 --> 01:59:14.997
TALIESIN: Is there a plate open or anything at the
moment near me?

01:59:14.997 --> 01:59:19.380
MATT: The only plate that’s open is the one that
has the lens visible, but it’s really close to the

01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:22.721
body and right now there’s blades spinning in its
space.

01:59:22.721 --> 01:59:27.448
TALIESIN: I’m going to try and get to the side
without the blade. I’m going to try and chop open

01:59:27.448 --> 01:59:34.403
one of the plates on the back. I’m going to start
hacking away at it. Actually, even with the

01:59:34.403 --> 01:59:40.586
blades, there’s an open place right now? Is there
a place for me to start poking the tender insides?

01:59:40.586 --> 01:59:46.745
MATT: At the moment, not really. It’s still fresh
in battle, and its armor plates are pretty much

01:59:46.745 --> 01:59:47.769
protecting all of it.

01:59:47.769 --> 01:59:50.554
TALIESIN: I’m going to try and find one armor
plate and start going to town.

01:59:50.554 --> 01:59:52.553
MATT: Where are you going to attack its
construction?

01:59:52.553 --> 01:59:58.461
TALIESIN: I want to get to its left hind quarters.
I’m going to run over to the opposite side, flank

01:59:58.461 --> 01:59:59.867
it with the lollipop.

01:59:59.867 --> 02:00:02.811
MATT: Oh, with the lollipop? All righty. You’re
going to be right there, on top of the door?

02:00:02.811 --> 02:00:03.937
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:00:03.937 --> 02:00:05.510
MATT: All righty, take your attacks.

02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:09.794
TALIESIN: First attack is a natural 20!

02:00:09.794 --> 02:00:15.188
MATT: Nice! Make your damage on that and roll the
second attack. That’s--

02:00:15.188 --> 02:00:25.124
TALIESIN: 2d6 with ice damage. That’s (counting)
17 points of damage.

02:00:25.124 --> 02:00:27.769
MATT: 17 points of damage. Nice!

02:00:27.769 --> 02:00:32.774
TALIESIN: Next attack with the same sword.
Actually, I’m so sorry, that’s the wrong sword.

02:00:32.774 --> 02:00:37.617
That’s 18 points of damage because of the Summer’s
Dance.

02:00:37.617 --> 02:00:38.232
MATT: Correct.

02:00:38.232 --> 02:00:46.247
TALIESIN: Then the next one, Summer’s Dance again,
is not quite as good, 12. That does not hit.

02:00:46.247 --> 02:00:51.461
MATT: 12 does not, but first strike carves through
and some of the armor bends inward. As you cut

02:00:51.461 --> 02:00:56.481
through, plates bend inward, and have to try and
retract to protect, but they’re locked in place.

02:00:56.481 --> 02:01:02.207
You’ve actually bent them to the point where they
cannot reform this armored mesh. It’s trying to

02:01:02.207 --> 02:01:07.185
correct itself, but busted in place. The second
strike, as you come down, one of the blades

02:01:07.185 --> 02:01:11.739
catches and parries it off to the side. No impact
on the second blow.

02:01:11.739 --> 02:01:13.452
TALIESIN: Okay. Going for a third strike.

02:01:13.452 --> 02:01:14.111
MATT: Go for it.

02:01:14.111 --> 02:01:16.738
TALIESIN: 14.

02:01:16.738 --> 02:01:22.945
MATT: 14 does not hit. This is a tough mother. You
go to strike a third time. You do hit, but it just

02:01:22.945 --> 02:01:26.637
doesn’t cut through. The blade shakes a bit. You
pull back, cursing yourself.

02:01:26.637 --> 02:01:32.604
TALIESIN: Is it worth seeing if it’s going to--
well, it’s blinded, so it’s got disadvantage if it

02:01:33.035 --> 02:01:39.319
tries to even hit me with an attack, so I’m going
to try and back off and climb up that little hill.

02:01:39.319 --> 02:01:44.513
MATT: For those questioning, even though it is
blinded, it lowers its attack, because some people

02:01:44.513 --> 02:01:47.587
are like, "Attacking things with blindness have
advantage!". Because it is nothing but a spinning,

02:01:47.587 --> 02:01:54.245
whirring of blades, and technically it has
multiple forms of sight, it is not granting

02:01:54.245 --> 02:01:56.888
advantage on the attacks against it.

02:01:56.888 --> 02:02:01.484
TALIESIN: I’m going to try and hop up that hill
really quickly.

02:02:01.484 --> 02:02:04.385
MATT: All righty. You try and move this way?

02:02:04.385 --> 02:02:05.034
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:02:05.034 --> 02:02:07.384
MATT: All right, you’re hopping up this edge.

02:02:07.384 --> 02:02:10.351
TALIESIN: As high as I can get to get out of its
range.

02:02:10.351 --> 02:02:13.237
MATT: Okay, so that will be probably over here,
best you can for this.

02:02:13.237 --> 02:02:15.282
TALIESIN: Yeah. Right over there is good.

02:02:15.282 --> 02:02:20.346
MATT: You manage to scoot yourself up to that side
and climb away. It does swing out towards you. It

02:02:20.346 --> 02:02:29.518
does have disadvantage on the attack because of
the blindness. That will bring it to a 13 to hit.

02:02:29.518 --> 02:02:30.723
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

02:02:30.723 --> 02:02:32.444
MATT: You manage to duck out of the way.

02:02:32.444 --> 02:02:34.037
TALIESIN: And now it doesn't have a reaction
anymore.

02:02:34.037 --> 02:02:34.630
SAM: Ooh, nice.

02:02:34.630 --> 02:02:38.907
MATT: That ends your turn there. That brings us to
Caleb and Jester.

02:02:38.907 --> 02:02:43.923
LIAM: [no audio]

02:02:43.923 --> 02:02:45.726
SAM and TALIESIN: We can't hear you.

02:02:45.726 --> 02:02:46.817
SAM: Why can't we hear you?

02:02:46.817 --> 02:02:50.124
MARISHA: Yeah, we can hear you now. Oh wait, do it
again.

02:02:50.124 --> 02:02:51.375
LIAM: Can you hear me right now?

02:02:51.375 --> 02:02:51.940
ALL: Yes!

02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:58.369
LIAM: Yeah! Okay. I'll go, but I can't see. The
map is a pixelated mess of shit from my point of view.

02:02:58.369 --> 02:03:05.185
After Mollymauk cleared the way, is the thing on its
own? Is it in a 40-foot cube of empty space, or

02:03:05.185 --> 02:03:06.583
are any of my allies in it?

02:03:06.583 --> 02:03:10.647
MATT: No, it is surrounded. There's Beau to one
part of it, it's about ten feet from Yasha, and

02:03:10.647 --> 02:03:12.818
about 15 feet from Molly.

02:03:12.818 --> 02:03:14.429
MARISHA: It's a pretty tight box we're in.

02:03:14.429 --> 02:03:15.743
TALIESIN: We're in a tight box.

02:03:15.743 --> 02:03:22.869
LIAM: Slow is out the window. I pull out my clay
cat's paw and mutter a few words, and I will cast

02:03:22.869 --> 02:03:28.974
Maximilian's Earthen Grasp. A soil cat's paw comes
up out of the ground and swipes. It needs to make

02:03:28.974 --> 02:03:31.113
a strength save. 16.

02:03:31.113 --> 02:03:38.664
MATT: Strength save. That is a 15. What is your
DC?

02:03:38.664 --> 02:03:54.737
LIAM: 16. It's held in place, and it takes 2d6
damage. Hold on. It takes five points of

02:03:54.737 --> 02:03:55.919
bludgeoning damage.

02:03:55.919 --> 02:04:00.499
MATT: Five points of damage, got it. It is held in
place.

02:04:00.499 --> 02:04:02.661
LIAM: It has to use an action to break out.

02:04:02.661 --> 02:04:08.305
MATT: That it does. That ends your turn, Caleb.
Are you going to stay back in the corner where you are?

02:04:08.305 --> 02:04:12.647
LIAM: If I can squish even one square further away
from it, I would.

02:04:12.647 --> 02:04:17.106
MATT: You are backed up into the current corner,
as far away as you can get. That ends Caleb's

02:04:17.106 --> 02:04:18.808
turn. Jester's up. What are you guys doing with
Jester?

02:04:18.808 --> 02:04:27.849
TALIESIN: First off, we're going to have the
Spiritual Weapon take a swipe right at where the

02:04:27.849 --> 02:04:40.047
plates are already broken, and hit it again. Which
is a bonus action, and a plus seven to hit. Oh,

02:04:40.047 --> 02:04:50.914
that's not it. It's around here somewhere. There
it is. That's a 15.

02:04:50.914 --> 02:04:54.226
MATT: That was 15 to hit?

02:04:54.226 --> 02:04:57.722
TALIESIN: Wait, wait. (counting) Yeah, 15.

02:04:57.722 --> 02:05:04.407
MATT: That does not hit. The lollipop swings down,
and then bounces down off the armor. The Spiritual

02:05:04.407 --> 02:05:08.371
Weapon is not able to penetrate its armored hide.
That's your bonus action. Jester still has an action.

02:05:08.371 --> 02:05:12.963
TALIESIN: I don't think this is going to do
anything.

02:05:12.963 --> 02:05:17.069
MARISHA: (singing) Playing with your friends' D&amp;amp;D
characters!

02:05:17.069 --> 02:05:20.860
TALIESIN: I was thinking of trying maybe a--

02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:23.601
SAM: Simple Sacred Flame?

02:05:23.601 --> 02:05:31.033
TALIESIN: We could do Sacred Flame, or if you were
nearer I'd say Cure Wounds. Or we could do a

02:05:31.033 --> 02:05:32.962
Guiding Bolt.

02:05:32.962 --> 02:05:34.958
ASHLEY: Hey, that's a classic.

02:05:34.958 --> 02:05:38.670
TALIESIN: (like Jester) "We're going to do Guiding
Bolt." You roll this one.

02:05:38.670 --> 02:05:44.457
SAM: (imitating Taliesin) We're going to do
Guiding Bolt.

02:05:44.457 --> 02:05:47.280
ASHLEY: That's a 26.

02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:51.448
MATT: 26 definitely hits! Roll damage on that.

02:05:51.448 --> 02:05:53.920
TALIESIN: That's 4d6 radiant damage.

02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:56.044
MATT: Yes, and the next attack on it has
advantage.

02:05:56.044 --> 02:06:06.614
ASHLEY: Okay. Come on, Jester. Any pluses?

02:06:06.614 --> 02:06:07.771
TALIESIN: No, just 4d6.

02:06:07.771 --> 02:06:08.526
ASHLEY: 14.

02:06:08.526 --> 02:06:15.450
MATT: 14 points of damage. Nice. As the released
Guiding Bolt slams into the side of it, the blast

02:06:15.450 --> 02:06:21.560
of divine energy explodes. Some of the plates dent
inward and now you see this glittering energy

02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:27.134
that's entwining its body, giving you a glimmer of
some of the weak points to help you hit where

02:06:27.134 --> 02:06:32.092
it'll hurt the most. Does that finish Jester's
turn? She going to stay where she is, or is she

02:06:32.092 --> 02:06:33.015
going to move?

02:06:33.015 --> 02:06:41.722
TALIESIN: I feel like we should open up a little
bit. I think she's going to see if she can crawl

02:06:41.722 --> 02:06:45.550
over to the door, so she can hide behind it in
case something bad happens.

02:06:45.550 --> 02:06:48.697
MATT: Okay, so she tries to move into the
doorway.

02:06:48.697 --> 02:06:50.446
SAM: That door actually opens and closes, Matt?

02:06:50.446 --> 02:06:55.407
TALIESIN: In fact, she might be smart-- she has to
keep the Spiritual Weapon in visual range, right?

02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:55.966
MATT: Yeah.

02:06:55.966 --> 02:06:58.179
TALIESIN: Okay. She's going to just use that as
some cover.

02:06:59.409 --> 02:07:03.911
MATT: Sounds good. So that finishes Jester's turn.
Top of the round, Yasha.

02:07:03.911 --> 02:07:07.916
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'm going to (stuttering) pick
myself up.

02:07:11.706 --> 02:07:14.732
MATT: That's half your movement, so you still have
20 feet of movement.

02:07:16.682 --> 02:07:22.633
ASHLEY: Can I flank? Get around so Beau and I
are-- yeah.

02:07:22.633 --> 02:07:27.078
MATT: Right there. You are now flanking with Beau.
Your first attack has advantage anyway, because of

02:07:27.078 --> 02:07:28.191
the Guiding Bolt.

02:07:28.191 --> 02:07:29.311
ASHLEY: Right. That's right.

02:07:29.311 --> 02:07:35.067
SAM: Up the butt. Does it have a butt, Matt?

02:07:35.067 --> 02:07:40.158
MATT: You cannot discern any sort of rear end or
exhaust port.

02:07:40.158 --> 02:07:41.532
SAM: Does it poop?

02:07:41.532 --> 02:07:43.205
MATT: You'll find out, I'm sure.

02:07:43.205 --> 02:07:44.621
ASHLEY: 22.

02:07:44.621 --> 02:07:47.343
MATT: 22 hits. Roll damage on that first strike.

02:07:47.343 --> 02:07:49.048
TALIESIN: That's a lot.

02:07:49.048 --> 02:07:50.640
SAM: Everyone poops.

02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:52.746
MARISHA: We can't see the sphincter!

02:07:52.746 --> 02:07:57.515
TALIESIN: Oh wait, no! Everybody poops unless
they're an android, because then they must be destroyed.

02:07:57.515 --> 02:07:59.599
MARISHA: Oh yeah, sure. That's right.

02:07:59.599 --> 02:08:00.437
TALIESIN: Poop, poop.

02:08:03.657 --> 02:08:04.937
ASHLEY: 16.

02:08:04.937 --> 02:08:10.893
MATT: 16 points of damage. Cutting through bits
and pieces of it. Nice. That's your first strike

02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:17.015
on it. As you jam down, grinding off, some of the
metal plates pull away from it, and once again

02:08:17.015 --> 02:08:21.495
lock, unable to push back into place. There's
small places where you're starting to buckle parts

02:08:21.495 --> 02:08:24.894
of its exterior armor, so its AC actually does go
down by one.

02:08:24.894 --> 02:08:25.458
SAM: Ooh!

02:08:25.458 --> 02:08:29.957
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. So I get another attack?

02:08:29.957 --> 02:08:31.500
MATT: That's your first strike. You get a second
attack.

02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:33.406
TALIESIN: So we now know at least a 17 will hit.

02:08:33.406 --> 02:08:34.920
ASHLEY: That does not have advantage, right?

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:36.472
MATT: You do, because you're currently flanking
with Beau.

02:08:36.472 --> 02:08:38.315
MARISHA: (singing) Because we're flanking, bitch!

02:08:38.315 --> 02:08:41.902
ASHLEY: That's a 25.

02:08:41.902 --> 02:08:44.094
MATT: 25 does hit. Roll damage.

02:08:44.094 --> 02:08:48.478
ASHLEY: Not an extra, because not Divine Fury?

02:08:48.478 --> 02:08:51.206
MATT: Correct. Just 2d6 plus five.

02:08:51.206 --> 02:08:53.191
ASHLEY: Okay. That's 11.

02:08:53.191 --> 02:08:57.530
MATT: 11 points of damage. Nice! Yasha, busting it
out. All right, that finish your turn?

02:08:57.530 --> 02:09:01.200
LIAM: Just a reminder that everyone is rolling at
advantage while the Cat's Paw holds it.

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.024
ALL: Ooh.

02:09:03.024 --> 02:09:05.977
MATT: Oh, because it's restrained? Right!

02:09:05.977 --> 02:09:07.851
TALIESIN: Blinded and restrained right now.

02:09:07.851 --> 02:09:11.409
MATT: Good to know. That finishes Yasha's turn.
It's now Fjord's go.

02:09:11.409 --> 02:09:19.618
MARISHA: (exaggerated Texan drawl) I do a cowboy
saunter up behind the-- I go under the lollipop

02:09:20.044 --> 02:09:26.134
and I use the magical field of the lollipop to
make it like me walking through a glitter fog

02:09:26.134 --> 02:09:39.395
machine. I walk up to him, thank you. I walk up,
and I'm going to attack with my falchion.

02:09:39.395 --> 02:09:49.412
MATT: Go for it. Make two strikes with the
falchion. First attack with advantage.

02:09:49.412 --> 02:09:50.888
MARISHA: I'm sorry, Travis.

02:09:50.888 --> 02:09:52.929
SAM: That's exactly how he talks.

02:09:52.929 --> 02:09:56.355
MARISHA: I'll take that 18, plus that seven.

02:09:56.355 --> 02:09:59.686
MATT: All right, that hits. The first attack,
that's a d8 plus--

02:09:59.686 --> 02:10:00.619
MARISHA: Plus Hex.

02:10:00.619 --> 02:10:02.796
MATT: A d8, plus four, plus Hex.

02:10:02.796 --> 02:10:09.035
MARISHA: And then I'm going do Booming Blade with
my action. Is that not how this works?

02:10:09.035 --> 02:10:10.093
MATT: No.

02:10:10.093 --> 02:10:11.919
MARISHA: Okay, no. I'm going to do damage.

02:10:11.919 --> 02:10:16.415
MATT: Booming Blade is a cantrip that only gives
you one attack as part of the action.

02:10:16.415 --> 02:10:18.470
MARISHA: Never mind, then I'm just going to hit it
real hard.

02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:19.318
MATT: That's okay.

02:10:19.318 --> 02:10:23.483
MARISHA: Six plus two plus five, so eight plus
five.

02:10:23.483 --> 02:10:25.920
MATT: All right, that's 13 damage.

02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:29.492
MARISHA: See my math? I can only do half. I'm so
tired.

02:10:29.492 --> 02:10:34.956
MATT: It's been a long day. I know. Fjord comes up
holding the falchion, hand swings down, carving

02:10:34.956 --> 02:10:39.846
through, the shadows of the Hex helping the blade
dig in that much more. You have a second attack.

02:10:39.846 --> 02:10:42.424
MARISHA: Okay, it's still advantage, right?

02:10:42.424 --> 02:10:43.014
MATT: Yep.

02:10:43.014 --> 02:10:46.885
MARISHA: Yeah, hyuck hyuck hyuck. I'll take that
16.

02:10:46.885 --> 02:10:51.893
LIAM: Meanwhile, Travis is somewhere singing "Dear
Theodosia."

02:10:51.893 --> 02:11:00.751
MARISHA: Yeah, somewhere he's getting a nosebleed
while this happens. Four plus four plus five, so 13?

02:11:00.751 --> 02:11:06.421
MATT: 13 points of damage? That hits again. With
that, with Fjord carving into it twice with the

02:11:06.421 --> 02:11:11.697
blade, each time the falchion is carving through
each section, more and more armored pieces are

02:11:11.697 --> 02:11:16.381
pushing inward. It's not enough to lower its AC,
but it is taking more and more damage. Slowly

02:11:16.381 --> 02:11:19.585
you're piercing its heavily protected exterior.

02:11:19.585 --> 02:11:21.784
MARISHA: Do I have any more movement?

02:11:21.784 --> 02:11:23.501
MATT: Fjord would have, yeah.

02:11:23.501 --> 02:11:24.578
MARISHA: Like ten more?

02:11:24.578 --> 02:11:25.302
MATT: Ten more feet.

02:11:25.302 --> 02:11:27.886
MARISHA: He's going to back up to that gate a
little bit.

02:11:27.886 --> 02:11:29.109
MATT: One or two steps?

02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:30.402
MARISHA: Two, if he can.

02:11:30.402 --> 02:11:32.081
MATT: All right. Still in melee.

02:11:32.081 --> 02:11:33.899
MARISHA: He's still in melee? Okay.

02:11:33.899 --> 02:11:37.024
MATT: It's a ten foot range. That ends your turn?

02:11:37.024 --> 02:11:38.722
MARISHA: Yep. That's Fjord's turn.

02:11:38.722 --> 02:11:44.530
MATT: All right. That brings us to the Gatekeeper
construct. The lens has retracted back into its

02:11:44.530 --> 02:11:53.577
armor, and you hear this sound (whirring) the lens
comes out, and it has cleared the tar from its lens.

02:11:53.577 --> 02:11:55.852
MARISHA: Cleff, you sick bastard!

02:11:55.852 --> 02:11:59.675
ASHLEY: Damn it! So he did think of that! He put
that in his notes!

02:11:59.675 --> 02:12:06.495
MARISHA: He did! Yeah, he said he didn't have a
failsafe. That lying old bastard.

02:12:06.495 --> 02:12:08.225
ASHLEY: Lying sack of shit.

02:12:08.225 --> 02:12:18.477
MATT: The lens retracts and pops out the back
side, immediately scanning the source of what's

02:12:18.477 --> 02:12:28.214
currently clutching it, and its dirt-driven arcane
paw. The blade arms on the top retract in, and

02:12:28.214 --> 02:12:37.934
instead these two heavy iron spears lock into
place, and both go firing outward towards Caleb.

02:12:37.934 --> 02:12:40.867
SAM: Oh no! Not my sweet boy!

02:12:40.867 --> 02:12:46.807
MATT: They have disadvantage, because it is
restrained. With disadvantage, it's going to be an

02:12:46.807 --> 02:12:48.169
18 to hit for the first one.

02:12:48.169 --> 02:12:48.635
LIAM: Shield.

02:12:48.635 --> 02:12:49.601
MATT: All right.

02:12:49.601 --> 02:12:51.077
LIAM: So it misses.

02:12:51.077 --> 02:12:59.265
MATT: All righty. Second one, 16 and 18. 16 plus
eight; it's going to be 24.

02:12:59.667 --> 02:13:02.412
LIAM: Oh, that will hit. Those will hit.

02:13:02.412 --> 02:13:08.325
MATT: The first one, the shield (clang). It
ricochets off and floats off in the background

02:13:08.325 --> 02:13:12.387
spinning. The second one, however, pierces through
the shield and hits you in the chest.

02:13:12.387 --> 02:13:13.901
LIAM: That's not going to be good.

02:13:17.161 --> 02:13:21.231
MATT: That's going to be 17 points of piercing
damage.

02:13:21.231 --> 02:13:22.994
LIAM: Good, good, good.

02:13:22.994 --> 02:13:29.420
MATT: And you are pinned to the wall. It actually
pierced through your chest and is now holding you

02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:33.618
into the stone. Your movement is zero, and you are
considered restrained against the wall.

02:13:33.618 --> 02:13:36.378
LIAM: I also have to make a concentration check.

02:13:36.378 --> 02:13:44.748
MATT: You do. So go ahead and make a constitution
check. With the damage taken, it has to be at

02:13:44.748 --> 02:13:46.231
least a ten or higher.

02:13:46.231 --> 02:13:53.743
LIAM: Hold on. I rolled a three.

02:13:53.743 --> 02:13:58.941
MATT: No, and with that, the paw is broken.

02:13:58.941 --> 02:14:00.145
SAM: (cat yowl)

02:14:00.145 --> 02:14:01.003
MARISHA: Shit.

02:14:01.003 --> 02:14:04.663
LIAM: Well, it's still there. It's just not
holding it. Wait, no, it's gone.

02:14:04.663 --> 02:14:09.648
MATT: No, it's gone. You’ve lost concentration on
the spell. And it did recharge its shrapnel blast.

02:14:09.648 --> 02:14:15.613
MARISHA: I was really wanting advantage on all my
attacks. Oh, but I have Yasha flanking. Okay.

02:14:15.613 --> 02:14:23.096
MATT: That being the case, that’s going to finish
its turn. It's going to stay put. Because the

02:14:23.464 --> 02:14:30.036
blades now grind out again and begin whirring and
spinning around its orb-like body. That brings us

02:14:30.036 --> 02:14:34.530
to Beau. Beau, at the top of your turn, because
you are within five feet of it, you automatically

02:14:34.530 --> 02:14:37.456
take whirling blade damage by being in proximity.

02:14:37.456 --> 02:14:39.818
LIAM: Matt, was that 17 points of damage?

02:14:39.818 --> 02:14:40.560
MATT: That was, yes.

02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.154
ASHLEY: I'm also in proximity.

02:14:42.154 --> 02:14:46.402
MATT: Yes. So at the top of your turn, you'll take
it as well. That's six points of slashing damage

02:14:46.402 --> 02:14:48.583
to you, Beau. Now take your turn.

02:14:48.583 --> 02:14:56.515
MARISHA: Six. Apply changes. (singing) D&amp;amp;D Beyond!

02:14:56.515 --> 02:15:00.648
SAM: My mustache is falling off, so I better hold
it on with another mustache.

02:15:01.309 --> 02:15:02.536
TALIESIN: No, stop.

02:15:02.536 --> 02:15:04.465
MATT: Fuck you, Sam!

02:15:04.465 --> 02:15:16.009
MARISHA: Okay. I'm having internet problems. View.
Okay, I get advantage on this attack, right?

02:15:16.009 --> 02:15:17.868
MATT: You do, because you're flanking.

02:15:17.868 --> 02:15:21.620
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to try and once again get
up in those plates.

02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:24.456
SAM: Get up under them plates!

02:15:24.456 --> 02:15:27.681
MARISHA: That one's cocked underneath. Okay!

02:15:27.681 --> 02:15:29.019
MATT: A four and a six.

02:15:29.019 --> 02:15:32.221
MARISHA: No, it was cocked underneath. It was
tilted.

02:15:32.221 --> 02:15:37.338
MATT: Okay. That dice is weird for that because
then you rolled the d20 twice.

02:15:37.338 --> 02:15:38.515
MARISHA: Then I won't use it.

02:15:38.515 --> 02:15:40.526
MATT: All right. So roll the second one.

02:15:40.526 --> 02:15:42.484
MARISHA: Okay, 17 plus seven.

02:15:42.484 --> 02:15:44.304
MATT: For the second strike?

02:15:44.304 --> 02:15:46.146
MARISHA: I rolled both at the same-- No, first to
strike.

02:15:46.146 --> 02:15:49.238
MATT: The first roll you had was a four on the
top, so roll for your second die.

02:15:49.238 --> 02:15:51.385
MARISHA: Okay.

02:15:51.385 --> 02:15:53.659
MATT: Just keeping it kosher.

02:15:53.659 --> 02:15:55.525
MARISHA: Okay. It's still an 18.

02:15:55.525 --> 02:15:58.940
MATT: 18 hits, yeah. Go ahead and make your strike
with your staff.

02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:03.041
MARISHA: Okay. Four.

02:16:03.041 --> 02:16:04.691
MATT: Four points of damage?

02:16:04.691 --> 02:16:06.566
MARISHA: Plus another four.

02:16:06.944 --> 02:16:13.578
MATT: So that's eight. As your staff strikes
across it, the wood of it, while damaging, doesn't

02:16:13.578 --> 02:16:17.432
seem to be having as strong an impact as you’d
hope against its armored form.

02:16:17.432 --> 02:16:19.945
MARISHA: Because it's not magical?

02:16:19.945 --> 02:16:22.819
MATT: It seems to be resistant to something that
is not magical.

02:16:22.819 --> 02:16:24.280
SAM: Oh no.

02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:27.728
MARISHA: Even though I still hit, can I try to
stun it with a Stunning Strike?

02:16:27.728 --> 02:16:32.121
MATT: Sure. Let's go ahead and-- I'm pretty
sure--

02:16:32.121 --> 02:16:36.513
MARISHA: I haven't hit anything in so long and I
just want to stun something. I've had such bad

02:16:36.513 --> 02:16:38.351
luck the past two fights.

02:16:38.351 --> 02:16:39.323
MATT: I'm so sorry.

02:16:39.323 --> 02:16:41.604
MARISHA: I haven't been such a good monk.

02:16:41.604 --> 02:16:44.897
LIAM: Yeah. (coughing) That's rough, buddy.

02:16:44.897 --> 02:16:54.178
SAM: So far we've learned today that Fjord sounds
like this: (goofy chuckling)

02:16:54.178 --> 02:16:57.965
MATT: By the rules as written, because it mentions
the ki of the inside of the body-- there is no ki,

02:16:57.965 --> 02:17:01.361
but there is a magical core. I'll say that when
you strike the body intending to stun it, while

02:17:01.361 --> 02:17:06.067
you're not affecting the ki of a soul, the ki that
you're expending might interfere with its central

02:17:06.067 --> 02:17:09.111
energy core. So it has to make a constitution
saving throw.

02:17:09.111 --> 02:17:09.828
MARISHA: Okay.

02:17:09.828 --> 02:17:15.335
MATT: That's going to be a 17. What's the DC?

02:17:15.335 --> 02:17:15.955
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:17:15.955 --> 02:17:17.461
MATT: It's a 12 plus five, I'm sorry.

02:17:17.461 --> 02:17:19.378
MARISHA: Yeah, it saves.

02:17:19.378 --> 02:17:22.046
MATT: You have another attack.

02:17:22.046 --> 02:17:25.101
MARISHA: I'm going to do that. Still have
advantage, right?

02:17:25.101 --> 02:17:25.970
MATT: You do.

02:17:25.970 --> 02:17:30.284
MARISHA: Man, it will be really awesome when that
monk ability, that's core of my class, actually

02:17:30.284 --> 02:17:32.644
works. 17 plus seven.

02:17:32.644 --> 02:17:36.593
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for
that. Second strike with your staff.

02:17:36.593 --> 02:17:37.921
MARISHA: Six.

02:17:37.921 --> 02:17:39.812
MATT: All right, six.

02:17:39.812 --> 02:17:43.565
MARISHA: Plus another four, so ten total. Sorry.

02:17:43.565 --> 02:17:49.135
MATT: It takes five points of damage as the second
strike is still somewhat deflected by the

02:17:49.135 --> 02:17:50.436
armor of its body.

02:17:50.436 --> 02:17:56.160
MARISHA: Since I have two hits, can I do Extract
Aspects? Spend a ki point?

02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:02.325
MATT: You can. You spend a ki point. Since we've
changed or errata-ed it, it does not make a saving

02:18:02.325 --> 02:18:03.717
throw. You just get to learn--

02:18:03.717 --> 02:18:05.171
MARISHA: I get to learn two things now?

02:18:05.171 --> 02:18:06.549
MATT: At level six you get to learn two things.

02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:10.821
MARISHA: Can I learn its lowest saving throw
ability?

02:18:10.821 --> 02:18:15.651
MATT: The lowest saving throw ability it has would
be charisma.

02:18:15.651 --> 02:18:21.511
(laughter)

02:18:21.511 --> 02:18:22.541
SAM: Useless!

02:18:22.541 --> 02:18:24.145
MATT: Not against some spells.

02:18:24.145 --> 02:18:28.705
MARISHA: Hey Molly, you want to mock this asshole
to death?

02:18:28.705 --> 02:18:33.157
TALIESIN: I think it would still go poorly, but
let's see if it comes to it.

02:18:33.157 --> 02:18:35.053
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to take my last attack.

02:18:35.053 --> 02:18:36.957
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:18:36.957 --> 02:18:38.192
MARISHA: Still at advantage, right?

02:18:38.192 --> 02:18:38.706
MATT: Yep.

02:18:38.706 --> 02:18:43.141
MARISHA: Okay, I hit with a 15 plus seven, so a
22.

02:18:43.141 --> 02:18:43.826
MATT: That hits.

02:18:43.826 --> 02:18:48.074
MARISHA: I have a d6 now. Five damage.

02:18:48.074 --> 02:18:53.725
MATT: Five damage reduced to two. This time, you
hit with your fists. Again, it scrapes through the

02:18:53.725 --> 02:18:58.327
armor, and you're bleeding at the knuckles from
the impact. It's hard to break through its shell.

02:18:58.327 --> 02:18:59.931
MARISHA: I'm feeling so useful, you guys.

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:03.006
MATT: This is a rough fight for a monk at level
five, unfortunately.

02:19:03.006 --> 02:19:05.458
TALIESIN: I got a crazy idea.

02:19:05.458 --> 02:19:07.289
MATT: That finish your turn, Beau?

02:19:07.289 --> 02:19:10.740
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to stay exactly where I
am.

02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:16.141
MATT: Okay, that finishes Beau's turn. Nott and
Molly, you're up.

02:19:16.141 --> 02:19:17.624
TALIESIN: You first, please.

02:19:17.624 --> 02:19:20.885
SAM: I'm going to scoot around and fire a crossbow
at it.

02:19:20.885 --> 02:19:21.869
MATT: Go for it.

02:19:21.869 --> 02:19:24.451
SAM: That's a 15 plus seven to hit.

02:19:24.451 --> 02:19:25.932
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:19:25.932 --> 02:19:28.087
SAM: Is it within melee and stuff?

02:19:28.087 --> 02:19:28.886
MATT: It is.

02:19:28.886 --> 02:19:33.909
SAM: Well, that wasn't good at all!

02:19:33.909 --> 02:19:35.606
TALIESIN: Hey, Beau.

02:19:35.606 --> 02:19:37.684
SAM: That's eight.

02:19:37.684 --> 02:19:43.162
MATT: Eight points of damage, reduce that in half
because it's a non-magical source. That's four

02:19:43.162 --> 02:19:44.756
points of piercing to it.

02:19:44.756 --> 02:19:49.632
SAM: I'll use my Fury Of The Small. That's another
five points.

02:19:49.632 --> 02:19:52.273
MARISHA: Are you using my friend's success to try
and make me feel better?

02:19:52.273 --> 02:19:55.476
TALIESIN: No, he actually only did four points of
damage. Sam only did four.

02:19:55.476 --> 02:19:57.994
MARISHA: Oh, you're trying to use my friend's
failure to make me feel better.

02:19:57.994 --> 02:20:04.362
MATT: It gets stuck in some of the gears. You see
some sparks from the inside, but it doesn't fully

02:20:04.362 --> 02:20:06.009
pierce its shell.

02:20:06.009 --> 02:20:16.204
SAM: Terrible. I can't really do anything. You
know what, I'll take out my last burning bolt,

02:20:16.204 --> 02:20:19.800
that should be magical, load it up and fire that.

02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:21.815
MATT: Go for it. That is a magical bolt.

02:20:21.815 --> 02:20:26.104
SAM: But that doesn't hit. I just wasted it. It's
14.

02:20:26.104 --> 02:20:32.215
MATT: The bolt doesn't impact. It just glides off
the armor. It lands somewhere in the distance. You

02:20:32.215 --> 02:20:34.236
don't know if it's retrievable or not yet.

02:20:34.236 --> 02:20:35.272
SAM: Damn it!

02:20:35.272 --> 02:20:36.653
MARISHA: It's impossible to take you seriously.

02:20:36.653 --> 02:20:38.176
SAM: What are you talking about?

02:20:38.176 --> 02:20:44.489
TALIESIN: I can't even-- I'm rooting for Nott,
then I look at you and I feel weird.

02:20:44.489 --> 02:20:46.023
MATT: Molly, you're up.

02:20:46.023 --> 02:20:47.922
SAM: I'm going to duck back a little bit.

02:20:47.922 --> 02:20:55.752
TALIESIN: I'm going to run in and try to do a
little bit more damage in here. I'm coming in and

02:20:55.752 --> 02:21:05.170
taking three more shots. I caught it. It's all
good. That one misses.

02:21:05.170 --> 02:21:10.391
MATT: All right, you move in. Go for it.

02:21:10.391 --> 02:21:14.383
TALIESIN: That one hits. That's a 19.

02:21:14.383 --> 02:21:20.676
MATT: First strike it dodges; it moves out of the
way. The second strike actually makes an impact,

02:21:20.676 --> 02:21:21.993
so roll for that.

02:21:22.577 --> 02:21:31.636
TALIESIN: That's okay. (counting) That's 12 points
of damage.

02:21:31.636 --> 02:21:38.220
MATT: 12 points of damage, all righty. Carves
through with the second strike.

02:21:38.220 --> 02:21:44.099
TALIESIN: For a third, slightly less exciting
attack. Natural 20!

02:21:44.099 --> 02:21:47.311
MATT: This is your off-hand, so it's not a magical
weapon.

02:21:47.311 --> 02:21:49.394
TALIESIN: But its magicked up.

02:21:49.394 --> 02:21:53.883
MATT: Correct, so the extra rite damage is
magical, but the actual blade will be halved.

02:21:53.883 --> 02:21:55.142
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine.

02:21:55.142 --> 02:21:57.063
MATT: So roll the d6 for your blade.

02:21:57.063 --> 02:22:01.738
TALIESIN: That's two to three, so that's five.

02:22:01.738 --> 02:22:05.909
MATT: Five reduced to two. So two damage plus
this, doubled. Well no, sorry, the two is doubled

02:22:05.934 --> 02:22:11.275
because it was a crit. So it would have been four
plus three, which is seven.

02:22:11.275 --> 02:22:12.751
TALIESIN: So it was a five.

02:22:12.751 --> 02:22:13.703
MATT: Sure, it's five damage.

02:22:13.703 --> 02:22:14.792
TALIESIN: And then six because this is doubled.

02:22:14.792 --> 02:22:20.439
MATT: So 11 points of damage. Now the armor is
reduced to 16 as you're carving away at its

02:22:20.439 --> 02:22:28.361
armored shell. It's starting to look pretty hurt.
You see it shifting rapidly trying to figure out

02:22:28.361 --> 02:22:31.558
its situation and tactically maneuver best it
can.

02:22:31.558 --> 02:22:37.097
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if I can hop back up
out of-- am I ever getting out of melee, or am I

02:22:37.097 --> 02:22:39.065
not getting out of melee?

02:22:39.065 --> 02:22:42.616
MATT: If you back all the way up to here, you can.
Or all the way up to the top.

02:22:42.616 --> 02:22:45.944
TALIESIN: It will still get an attack of opportunity
on me, though. Without disadvantage now.

02:22:45.944 --> 02:22:47.266
MATT: At the moment, no.

02:22:50.806 --> 02:22:53.723
TALIESIN: You know, I'm going to stick around for
now.

02:22:53.723 --> 02:22:54.325
MATT: Okay.

02:22:54.325 --> 02:23:04.570
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep a flanking point. I’m
going to move a little bit, so that we’re spread

02:23:04.570 --> 02:23:06.534
out around it. So it has to make some decisions.

02:23:06.534 --> 02:23:09.487
SAM: Can he use the rest of his movement to work
on his Jester accent?

02:23:09.487 --> 02:23:10.027
MATT: Sure.

02:23:10.027 --> 02:23:12.303
TALIESIN: That's going to be a lot of movement.

02:23:12.303 --> 02:23:17.758
MATT: Caleb and Jester, you're up next. Caleb,
you're currently pinned to the wall. You're muted

02:23:17.758 --> 02:23:19.362
also, I can't hear you.

02:23:19.362 --> 02:23:23.150
LIAM: What comes after Jester and I in the
initiative order?

02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:24.016
MATT: Yasha does.

02:23:24.016 --> 02:23:25.332
LIAM: Yasha does, and then the thing?

02:23:25.332 --> 02:23:28.401
MATT: Yes, Yasha, Fjord, and then the thing.

02:23:28.401 --> 02:23:31.271
MARISHA: And Jester is with you.

02:23:31.271 --> 02:23:39.140
LIAM: Yeah, I know. I'm having trouble thinking
straight because there is a blade through my gut

02:23:39.140 --> 02:23:45.472
and my rib cage. So I grasp the cat's paw again, I
don't try to pull myself loose, and I cast

02:23:45.472 --> 02:23:51.487
Maximilian's Earthen Paw again. Strength save.

02:23:51.487 --> 02:23:59.739
MATT: As the paw reaches out once more to grab
it-- that is a 19. 14 plus five. Sorry, man.

02:23:59.739 --> 02:24:07.071
You're still maintaining concentration, but it did
not seem to grasp it at this moment. All right,

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:09.093
that ends Caleb's turn. Jester's up.

02:24:09.093 --> 02:24:13.648
MARISHA: No, don't do that! Go back. Sorry, keep
going.

02:24:13.648 --> 02:24:21.051
TALIESIN: Should I try something offensive or
healing-based, do you think? How are you doing, Caleb?

02:24:21.051 --> 02:24:22.284
LIAM: Bad.

02:24:24.454 --> 02:24:28.334
TALIESIN: Okay, so we're going to do this. We're
going to run out and cast Healing Word on Caleb.

02:24:28.334 --> 02:24:33.548
MATT: Okay, so step back through the door a little
bit there. What level?

02:24:33.548 --> 02:24:34.560
TALIESIN: Level one.

02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:37.095
MATT: So a d4 plus four to Caleb.

02:24:37.554 --> 02:24:42.531
TALIESIN: Yes, 1d4 plus four. So that's seven
points.

02:24:42.531 --> 02:24:49.677
MATT: Caleb, you heal seven points. That's a bonus
action from Jester. What's next? You can only use

02:24:49.677 --> 02:24:52.956
a cantrip since you've cast a bonus action spell.

02:24:52.956 --> 02:24:55.285
ASHLEY: So the Spiritual Weapon?

02:24:55.285 --> 02:24:59.039
MATT: Spiritual Weapon is a bonus action spell.
You've already used the Healing Word, unfortunately.

02:24:59.044 --> 02:25:00.443
TALIESIN: But I can use my action for the bonus
action.

02:25:00.443 --> 02:25:01.449
MATT: It doesn't work that way.

02:25:01.449 --> 02:25:02.713
TALIESIN: You can't up a bonus action to an
action?

02:25:02.713 --> 02:25:03.323
MATT: No.

02:25:03.323 --> 02:25:08.601
TALIESIN: Man! So I can't cast anything higher
than level one either, can I?

02:25:08.601 --> 02:25:09.462
MATT: Or a cantrip.

02:25:09.462 --> 02:25:13.623
TALIESIN: I can only cast cantrip at this point. I
would have done that in the reverse order if I had

02:25:13.623 --> 02:25:16.427
been thinking about things. Well, what do I got? I
got a-- oh!

02:25:16.427 --> 02:25:18.122
MATT: But Caleb's healed a little bit.

02:25:18.122 --> 02:25:21.880
TALIESIN: Caleb's healed and that's good. Do we
want to try?

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:25.488
ASHLEY: Yeah, I say give it a go.

02:25:25.488 --> 02:25:28.338
TALIESIN: Let's try Toll the Dead.

02:25:28.338 --> 02:25:30.366
MATT: Constitution saving throw?

02:25:30.366 --> 02:25:32.617
TALIESIN: It's a wisdom saving throw.

02:25:32.617 --> 02:25:35.067
MATT: Wisdom to Toll the Dead?

02:25:35.067 --> 02:25:40.948
TALIESIN: You point at one creature you can see
within range, and the sound of a-- you succeed at

02:25:40.948 --> 02:25:42.938
a wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 of necrotic.

02:25:42.938 --> 02:25:47.292
MATT: It is wisdom, you are right. So that would
put it at a 14. Because it has no wisdom modifier.

02:25:48.015 --> 02:25:48.966
ASHLEY: 15.

02:25:48.966 --> 02:25:50.961
MATT: 15, so it takes the damage! Go ahead and
roll.

02:25:50.961 --> 02:25:54.474
TALIESIN: If the target is missing any of its hit
points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

02:25:54.474 --> 02:25:56.935
MATT: You're level five, so it technically--

02:25:56.935 --> 02:25:58.428
SAM: (Jester voice) Technically!

02:25:58.428 --> 02:26:00.493
MATT: It's a 5th-level character, so it's--

02:26:00.493 --> 02:26:03.648
MATT and TALIESIN: 2d12.

02:26:03.648 --> 02:26:10.562
TALIESIN: All right. That's 17 points of necrotic
damage.

02:26:10.562 --> 02:26:12.711
MATT: Not bad for a cantrip!

02:26:12.711 --> 02:26:13.419
TALIESIN: Boom!

02:26:13.419 --> 02:26:19.542
MATT: "It's not too bad." All right, that's going
to finish Jester's turn. Does she want to move?

02:26:19.542 --> 02:26:23.946
TALIESIN: I think she's going to back up again.

02:26:23.946 --> 02:26:28.373
MATT: Back into the door? You got it. Jester is
just on the side there. All right, finishes

02:26:28.628 --> 02:26:30.122
Jester's go, Yasha you're up.

02:26:30.122 --> 02:26:36.347
ASHLEY: Okay, I am going to attack with my--

02:26:36.347 --> 02:26:40.672
MATT: At the top of your turn, you take blade
damage because you're in proximity to it. That's

02:26:40.672 --> 02:26:43.460
ten. You take ten points of piercing damage. So,
reduced to five.

02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:46.216
TALIESIN: You're a beast. You're great.

02:26:46.216 --> 02:26:58.882
ASHLEY: All right, so, question? I would like to
try to use the Dispel Magic portion of my

02:26:58.882 --> 02:27:00.032
Magician's Judge.

02:27:00.032 --> 02:27:00.542
SAM: Now?

02:27:00.542 --> 02:27:01.296
ASHLEY: I don't know; is that bad?

02:27:01.296 --> 02:27:05.439
SAM: I don't know, can you get in there? Is the
guts exposed?

02:27:05.439 --> 02:27:09.532
TALIESIN: Is there enough gut to hit?

02:27:09.532 --> 02:27:14.031
MATT: There are a couple of pockets where you can
see inside of it, but you don't see the power

02:27:14.031 --> 02:27:15.552
source. It's risky.

02:27:15.552 --> 02:27:17.794
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to wait.

02:27:17.794 --> 02:27:22.445
MATT: So you're just taking a strike with it? You
have advantage because you're flanked with Beau.

02:27:22.445 --> 02:27:27.156
MARISHA: I think that's the best thing I've done
this whole fight, is flanking.

02:27:27.156 --> 02:27:31.152
MATT: Some fights aren't great for every class,
I'm sorry.

02:27:31.152 --> 02:27:31.714
ASHLEY: 19.

02:27:31.714 --> 02:27:33.695
MATT: 19 hits! Roll damage.

02:27:33.695 --> 02:27:35.209
TALIESIN: 16 to hit, so that's not bad.

02:27:35.209 --> 02:27:36.165
MATT: Yep, 16 AC.

02:27:36.865 --> 02:27:44.891
ASHLEY: Okay. 17 points.

02:27:44.891 --> 02:27:50.893
MATT: 17 points! Carving past with the blade. You
have a second strike, if you'd like.

02:27:50.893 --> 02:27:55.249
ASHLEY: I would like-- Does that also have
advantage, or no?

02:27:55.249 --> 02:27:57.229
MATT: Yeah it is, because you're flanking.

02:28:00.659 --> 02:28:03.684
ASHLEY: Okay, ooh! 22.

02:28:03.684 --> 02:28:05.530
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Roll damage again.

02:28:05.530 --> 02:28:12.443
ASHLEY: 16.

02:28:12.443 --> 02:28:22.028
MATT: 33 points of damage in one round. Yasha
doesn't mess around. That finishes your turn?

02:28:22.028 --> 02:28:23.822
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:28:23.822 --> 02:28:25.276
MATT: Fjord's up.

02:28:25.276 --> 02:28:37.725
MARISHA: Okay, Fjord is going to walk up. "I'm a
warlock." First, he's going to do-- I don't think

02:28:38.215 --> 02:28:43.181
this is a concentration thing, it's a bonus
action. He's going to do Hexblade's Curse.

02:28:43.181 --> 02:28:44.930
MATT: Correct, you can do that.

02:28:44.930 --> 02:28:45.953
SAM: It's pronounced--

02:28:45.953 --> 02:28:50.542
SAM, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: (exaggerated Texas
drawl) Hexblade's Curse.

02:28:50.542 --> 02:28:56.831
TALIESIN: So much fun to make fun of him when he's
not here. I think, at some point, you may need

02:28:56.831 --> 02:28:58.156
another mustache.

02:28:58.156 --> 02:29:02.651
MARISHA: I gain a bonus to damage rolls that
equals my proficiency modifier.

02:29:02.651 --> 02:29:04.825
MATT: So an additional three damage per strike.

02:29:04.825 --> 02:29:07.509
MARISHA: An additional three damage! I should have
done this forever ago.

02:29:07.509 --> 02:29:08.662
MATT: Yeah, but now you know.

02:29:08.662 --> 02:29:13.861
MARISHA: I'm not a warlock! First attack, still
with advantage, right?

02:29:13.861 --> 02:29:16.156
MATT: No! You're not flanking with anybody.

02:29:16.156 --> 02:29:20.227
MARISHA: Oh, he's not. It's just Yasha and I.

02:29:20.227 --> 02:29:23.287
MATT: So first attack with the falchion.

02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:25.059
MARISHA: Plus seven.

02:29:25.059 --> 02:29:27.157
MATT: That's two attacks there.

02:29:27.157 --> 02:29:31.267
MARISHA: Oh wait, sorry. But I'll take it. Those
first two attacks, 17 and 14.

02:29:31.267 --> 02:29:35.913
MATT: Yeah, both will hit, so roll damage on each.
So a d8 plus--

02:29:35.913 --> 02:29:37.448
MARISHA: d8 plus six.

02:29:37.448 --> 02:29:42.352
MATT: d8 plus seven on each attack, plus a d6 on
each. So roll that.

02:29:42.352 --> 02:29:51.175
MARISHA: Six plus seven, so 13 on the first one.
Same, 13 on the second one.

02:29:51.175 --> 02:29:57.866
MATT: Nice! Starting to look pretty rough now, as
parts of it are breaking down a bit. It's shaking

02:29:57.866 --> 02:30:02.409
and you see little sparks on the inside as gears
are starting to connect where they’re not supposed

02:30:02.409 --> 02:30:05.174
to and grind against each other. That finish
Fjord's turn?

02:30:05.174 --> 02:30:06.747
MARISHA: Yeah, can he back up again?

02:30:06.747 --> 02:30:08.206
MATT: Five feet or ten?

02:30:08.206 --> 02:30:09.129
MARISHA: Ten?

02:30:09.129 --> 02:30:13.416
MATT: One more and it’ll take an attack of
opportunity. Up to you.

02:30:13.416 --> 02:30:22.421
MARISHA: If he does an attack of opportunity, if I
move Fjord back, than we get a Sentinel strike, right?

02:30:22.421 --> 02:30:25.923
MATT: Technically, if he takes it.

02:30:25.923 --> 02:30:31.494
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it! Sorry, Fjord. He
hasn't taken any damage, step back. He still has

02:30:31.494 --> 02:30:33.494
Armor of Agathys, too.

02:30:33.494 --> 02:30:36.834
TALIESIN: Step all the way back. Might as well,
because you can always run back there.

02:30:36.834 --> 02:30:39.490
MARISHA: I think that's as far as he can go,
movement speed-wise.

02:30:39.490 --> 02:30:42.781
MATT: No, he can move farther than that.

02:30:42.781 --> 02:30:43.402
MARISHA: Sure.

02:30:43.402 --> 02:30:48.887
MATT: Okay, it's not going to take an attack of
opportunity. It's currently focused on everything

02:30:48.887 --> 02:30:49.735
else around it.

02:30:49.735 --> 02:30:51.282
MARISHA: What?! Okay.

02:30:51.282 --> 02:30:56.132
MATT: That finishes Fjord's turn?

02:30:56.132 --> 02:30:57.435
MARISHA: Yes, it does.

02:30:57.435 --> 02:31:15.375
MATT: This entity is going to attempt to shift
back this way. Which means Beau and Molly both get

02:31:15.897 --> 02:31:17.062
attacks of opportunity against it.

02:31:17.062 --> 02:31:18.314
ASHLEY: I get one?

02:31:18.314 --> 02:31:20.064
MATT: You do not, because it's still in melee with
you.

02:31:20.064 --> 02:31:21.789
TALIESIN: Do you get to try and make it not move?

02:31:21.789 --> 02:31:24.202
MARISHA: I do. Do I still get advantage because
flank?

02:31:24.202 --> 02:31:25.885
MATT: No, because it's moved out of that range.

02:31:25.885 --> 02:31:31.694
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, that's a 17 plus seven, so
24.

02:31:31.694 --> 02:31:34.553
MATT: 24 hits, so roll damage. It does not move.

02:31:34.553 --> 02:31:41.226
MARISHA: That's an eight on an eight. Plus four,
so 12 damage.

02:31:41.226 --> 02:31:42.793
MATT: 12 reduced to six, got it.

02:31:42.793 --> 02:31:44.098
MARISHA: And he does not move.

02:31:44.098 --> 02:31:46.834
MATT: Nope, he gets stuck there. The bane of all
GMs everywhere.

02:31:46.834 --> 02:31:49.944
TALIESIN: I don't still get to take my attack of
opportunity, even though that happened?

02:31:49.944 --> 02:31:54.094
MATT: No, he did not technically move out of--
it's sticky. It's one of those weird things where

02:31:54.094 --> 02:31:58.037
he doesn't technically move beyond the range, but
he tries to.

02:31:58.037 --> 02:32:00.065
TALIESIN: He tried to and I try to make a jab.

02:32:00.065 --> 02:32:01.450
MATT: I'll let you have it, sure.

02:32:01.450 --> 02:32:02.883
TALIESIN: I'll take no advantage.

02:32:02.883 --> 02:32:03.945
MATT: You have no advantage.

02:32:03.945 --> 02:32:04.916
TALIESIN: I thought I might be flanked.

02:32:04.916 --> 02:32:08.108
MATT: Currently, no. You would need something
right there in that corner to flank.

02:32:12.178 --> 02:32:15.485
TALIESIN: That's a (counting) 24 to hit.

02:32:15.485 --> 02:32:16.744
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:32:19.684 --> 02:32:28.818
TALIESIN: That's (counting) nine points of damage.
Yeah, nine.

02:32:28.818 --> 02:32:32.782
MATT: It angrily is going to open to do its
shrapnel blast.

02:32:33.263 --> 02:32:38.474
SAM: Yeah. Where? Oh no, Caleb, you're in that
cone.

02:32:38.474 --> 02:32:39.423
MARISHA: Ah, Caleb!

02:32:39.423 --> 02:32:42.020
SAM: Oh no, he's dead already!

02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:44.798
MARISHA: Oh god! How long has he been like that?

02:32:44.798 --> 02:32:53.199
MATT: It was that powerful! I need Molly, Beau,
Fjord, and Caleb, and technically Jester, as

02:32:53.199 --> 02:32:53.566
well.

02:32:53.566 --> 02:32:55.831
ASHLEY: Isn't she behind the door?

02:32:55.831 --> 02:32:59.819
MATT: She didn't close the door there. She stepped
into the space to maintain eye contact.

02:32:59.819 --> 02:33:07.465
SAM: (singing) Open the door on your mystery date.
Caleb, you have to make a dex save.

02:33:07.465 --> 02:33:09.211
TALIESIN: Dex save?

02:33:09.211 --> 02:33:10.664
MATT: Dex save, please.

02:33:10.664 --> 02:33:12.275
LIAM: 20.

02:33:12.275 --> 02:33:14.046
MATT: That's a success.

02:33:14.046 --> 02:33:16.405
MARISHA: 14.

02:33:16.405 --> 02:33:17.296
MATT: That is a failure.

02:33:17.296 --> 02:33:18.954
SAM: How? You're pinned to a wall!

02:33:18.954 --> 02:33:22.261
TALIESIN: Dex save? 22 for me.

02:33:22.261 --> 02:33:25.877
MATT: Success. Oh, you're not there. Nott?

02:33:25.877 --> 02:33:27.623
LIAM: I spun myself like a pinwheel.

02:33:27.623 --> 02:33:29.533
MATT: Fjord and Jester, if you could.

02:33:29.533 --> 02:33:32.081
SAM: Marisha, do one for Fjord.

02:33:32.081 --> 02:33:39.324
MARISHA: Don't fuck Fjord, Gil! Oh, good. 17 for
Fjord.

02:33:39.324 --> 02:33:41.076
TALIESIN: Ten for Jester.

02:33:41.076 --> 02:33:48.955
MATT: Okay, so everyone saves except for Fjord.
Sorry, Jester. 27 points of piercing damage,

02:33:48.955 --> 02:33:52.476
halved to be 13 points of piercing damage to
everybody.

02:33:52.476 --> 02:33:53.738
MARISHA: Do I save?

02:33:53.738 --> 02:33:55.192
MATT: You rolled a--?

02:33:55.192 --> 02:33:56.094
MARISHA: 14.

02:33:56.094 --> 02:33:58.627
MATT: No, you do not, so you take the full 27
points of piercing damage.

02:33:58.627 --> 02:34:01.392
TALIESIN: Okay, so 14 points of piercing damage.

02:34:01.392 --> 02:34:03.414
MARISHA: I had 27 hit points left.

02:34:03.414 --> 02:34:04.850
MATT: No shit?

02:34:04.850 --> 02:34:06.216
ASHLEY: You’re unconscious?

02:34:06.216 --> 02:34:09.082
MARISHA: Beau’s unconscious again.

02:34:09.082 --> 02:34:12.546
SAM: How about you, Cay? Cay-Cay?

02:34:12.546 --> 02:34:13.848
LIAM: Low.

02:34:13.848 --> 02:34:15.382
SAM: Low, okay.

02:34:15.382 --> 02:34:19.230
MATT: And still pinned. Jester took a full 27.

02:34:19.230 --> 02:34:20.040
SAM: How's she?

02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:22.220
ASHLEY: Jester took a full 27?

02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:25.772
MATT: She rolled low for her dexterity check. 27
points of damage.

02:34:25.772 --> 02:34:32.533
TALIESIN: Is that the whole, or did you not do the
whole thing? I'm up. I'm fine.

02:34:32.533 --> 02:34:38.895
MATT: That's its action. It is locked in place and
it can't move. Its speed is zero, frustratingly.

02:34:38.895 --> 02:34:44.697
Caleb, I need you to make another concentration
check, please, from the damage you took.

02:34:44.697 --> 02:34:46.880
LIAM: On what? Nothing's up.

02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:49.605
MATT: I thought your other cat hand?

02:34:49.605 --> 02:34:51.590
LIAM: That failed last time, didn't it?

02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:55.599
MATT: It failed, but can you still try it for
every turn after, or is it a one-time cast thing?

02:34:55.599 --> 02:35:03.980
LIAM: It can use a strength save to break out of
it and it exists, but if I fail my concentration

02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:06.072
check, it goes, right?

02:35:06.072 --> 02:35:07.520
MATT: But you've recast it.

02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:11.747
LIAM: The second time it succeeded immediately.

02:35:11.747 --> 02:35:16.891
MATT: Right, but when you create it in space, it
stays there.

02:35:16.891 --> 02:35:18.219
LIAM: It stays there?

02:35:18.219 --> 02:35:20.894
MATT: Yeah, and then as an action you can cause it
to try and do things--

02:35:20.894 --> 02:35:25.023
LIAM: Great! Then that means it's staying there.

02:35:25.023 --> 02:35:28.573
MATT: Make a concentration check to see if you
maintain the spell.

02:35:28.573 --> 02:35:29.177
LIAM: Yes, sir.

02:35:29.177 --> 02:35:30.720
MATT: Higher than a ten.

02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:33.371
LIAM: 12.

02:35:33.371 --> 02:35:37.796
MATT: All right, you succeed. You maintain
concentration. That finishes your turn. Beau,

02:35:37.796 --> 02:35:39.134
you're up first.

02:35:39.134 --> 02:35:40.766
SAM: Do that thing you do, Beau.

02:35:40.766 --> 02:35:44.533
MARISHA: Roll a death saving throw? That is the
thing I do.

02:35:44.533 --> 02:35:47.653
MATT: You don't have to roll. You take damage from
proximity to it, so you automatically fail a death

02:35:47.653 --> 02:35:51.316
saving throw from the blades carving into your
now-unconscious body nearby.

02:35:51.316 --> 02:35:56.794
MARISHA: Do I roll again? Can I take the roll I
just used?

02:35:56.794 --> 02:35:58.516
MATT: Yeah, whatever you rolled on your death
saving throw.

02:35:58.516 --> 02:35:58.975
MARISHA: 14.

02:35:58.975 --> 02:36:03.861
MATT: Yeah, so that's a failure and a success.
That brings us to Nott and Molly.

02:36:03.861 --> 02:36:06.396
TALIESIN: You want to go first?

02:36:06.396 --> 02:36:08.003
SAM: Sure?

02:36:08.003 --> 02:36:09.513
TALIESIN: Got any thoughts?

02:36:09.513 --> 02:36:15.841
SAM: I mean, I don't have much. I'll walk up
there, poke around the corner, shoot a crossbow

02:36:15.841 --> 02:36:21.001
bolt, do my thing. That's a big hit. 25.

02:36:21.001 --> 02:36:23.429
MATT: That'll do. Roll damage with sneak attack.

02:36:23.943 --> 02:36:27.306
MARISHA: Should have brought more tar.

02:36:27.306 --> 02:36:29.905
SAM: Ten, halved.

02:36:29.905 --> 02:36:33.910
MATT: Five points of piercing damage on the first
strike. Do you want to bonus action attack as well?

02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:47.937
SAM: I guess? These attacks are so weak. I don't
know what else to do. I don't have anything else

02:36:47.937 --> 02:36:54.904
to do. Yeah, I guess I'll shoot another one. Why
not? That hits, 23.

02:36:54.904 --> 02:36:56.970
MATT: 23? Go ahead. That's 1d6 plus--

02:36:56.970 --> 02:36:59.865
SAM: That's another six points, halved.

02:36:59.865 --> 02:37:03.973
MATT: Halved to three, all righty. Sparks are
flying. It's starting to shake. Molly, top of your

02:37:03.973 --> 02:37:11.644
turn, the swirling blades spin around and you take
eight points of slashing damage. It's your turn.

02:37:11.644 --> 02:37:18.919
TALIESIN: (counting) Eight points of slashing
damage. Oof, that's rough. I'm going to take two

02:37:18.919 --> 02:37:29.113
swipes at-- I'm going to try and move. I'm going
to try and move somewhere where I'm flanking. Is

02:37:29.113 --> 02:37:31.711
there any flanking available at the moment?

02:37:31.711 --> 02:37:45.408
MATT: At the moment, for you, if you move over
Beau's body. It's a tough call. I mean, I'll let

02:37:45.408 --> 02:37:49.698
you do it, if you want to. You'll have to be
standing over her unconscious body.

02:37:49.698 --> 02:37:53.400
TALIESIN: I was about to say, is it in any way
that going to give her a little cover, at the very

02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:53.983
least?

02:37:53.983 --> 02:37:55.713
MATT: Probably not.

02:37:55.713 --> 02:37:59.101
TALIESIN: I'll move in and then move around--
well, no, goddamn it.

02:37:59.101 --> 02:38:01.326
MATT: It's up to you.

02:38:01.326 --> 02:38:05.820
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a couple shots and see
how this goes.

02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:08.273
MATT: Go for it. Take those shots, Molly.

02:38:08.273 --> 02:38:10.677
TALIESIN: Because I can use some hits that are all
right.

02:38:10.677 --> 02:38:12.610
SAM: Take those shots, Mollymauk.

02:38:12.610 --> 02:38:15.183
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's what we're doing. First
hit.

02:38:15.183 --> 02:38:16.767
LIAM: Don't throw away your shot.

02:38:16.767 --> 02:38:20.694
TALIESIN: I'm not throwing away my shot. That's a
22 to hit.

02:38:20.694 --> 02:38:21.348
MATT: That hits.

02:38:21.348 --> 02:38:27.374
TALIESIN: Let's get that first thing. That's 12
points of damage?

02:38:27.374 --> 02:38:30.602
MATT: 12 points of damage, all righty. Next
strike?

02:38:30.602 --> 02:38:36.687
TALIESIN: Next strike. That definitely hit. That's
24.

02:38:36.687 --> 02:38:38.644
MATT: Yep, roll damage on this one.

02:38:38.644 --> 02:38:43.850
TALIESIN: (counting) That's ten points of damage.

02:38:43.850 --> 02:38:50.622
MATT: Ten points of damage. How do you want to do
this? The blades are spinning, grinding around.

02:38:50.622 --> 02:38:55.375
TALIESIN: I've got that one really soft blade and
I'm rolling it, and I want to see that one little

02:38:55.375 --> 02:39:00.411
opening and I want it to bend. The sword bends and
does that Chinese martial art thing where it goes

02:39:00.411 --> 02:39:05.757
and pops all the way into the center of it, and I
go wrist deep into the thing.

02:39:05.757 --> 02:39:10.074
MATT: The edges of the armor scrape against your
flesh, pushing and cutting past skin, causing

02:39:10.074 --> 02:39:14.527
blood to drip down your arm, but this is a natural
state for you. As the arm pushes into the center,

02:39:14.527 --> 02:39:20.087
there's a flash of blue light, and the interior of
its armored shell (electricity crackling). It's

02:39:20.087 --> 02:39:26.659
like a glow on the inside of a cracked, dark orb,
as all the individual sections where the plate

02:39:26.659 --> 02:39:32.353
armors meet suddenly glow with a bright, vibrant
blue-white light, and then go dark, and the whole

02:39:32.353 --> 02:39:39.562
metal object hits the ground. All the legs go
limp, and it rolls a little bit to one side, now

02:39:39.562 --> 02:39:42.003
inert and no longer functioning as a construct.

02:39:42.003 --> 02:39:45.821
LIAM: That was a Chow Yun-Fat moment.

02:39:45.821 --> 02:39:49.830
TALIESIN: I got a new die, baby. Does it look
familiar, motherfucker?

02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:52.368
SAM: Is it the Snitch?

02:39:52.368 --> 02:39:54.593
TALIESIN: It's the nega-Snitch.

02:39:54.593 --> 02:39:55.877
MATT: The nega-Snitch.

02:39:55.877 --> 02:39:57.712
SAM: Where did you get that?

02:39:57.712 --> 02:40:00.524
TALIESIN: I found the place where the Snitch came
from. I had the woman make me one out of iron.

02:40:00.524 --> 02:40:02.094
MATT: I love it.

02:40:02.094 --> 02:40:03.989
TALIESIN: Boom, motherfucker.

02:40:03.989 --> 02:40:05.800
MATT: We'll see how it fares.

02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:07.834
TALIESIN: It's been middly, but it's done okay
today.

02:40:07.834 --> 02:40:10.153
SAM: Ecks versus Sever.

02:40:10.153 --> 02:40:12.009
TALIESIN: Gil has been a help today.

02:40:12.009 --> 02:40:18.315
MATT: All righty. You all take a moment. Beau is
bleeding out.

02:40:18.315 --> 02:40:21.365
TALIESIN: Oh, no, we're immediately going to
help.

02:40:21.365 --> 02:40:22.382
MATT: Jester runs up.

02:40:22.382 --> 02:40:25.785
ASHLEY: Jester runs up and casts Cure Wounds.

02:40:25.785 --> 02:40:27.752
SAM: Does she have a Cure Wounds?

02:40:27.752 --> 02:40:30.265
TALIESIN: Yeah, we got 1st-level Lay on Hands to
get her up.

02:40:30.265 --> 02:40:33.026
ASHLEY: At 1st-level, because I feel like that's
what she would do.

02:40:33.026 --> 02:40:36.464
MARISHA: You really get tired of this dying thing.
I guess unconscious thing.

02:40:36.464 --> 02:40:42.325
TALIESIN: You did so well. No, really. You did
some good stuff in there. You kept it sitting.

02:40:42.325 --> 02:40:43.670
LIAM: Yasha.

02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:44.315
ASHLEY: Yeah?

02:40:44.315 --> 02:40:49.472
LIAM: Could you please come cast Pull This
Lamppost Out of My Stomach?

02:40:49.472 --> 02:40:53.005
ASHLEY: Oh, yes, yes. I go over and I-- here.

02:40:53.456 --> 02:40:57.990
MATT: Yasha puts her foot up on the wall, and with
one big yank, pulls it out of your torso, Caleb.

02:40:57.990 --> 02:41:03.274
It was about two inches from the side of your body
and thrust through your abdomen. You begin to

02:41:03.274 --> 02:41:09.184
bleed, but Jester comes over and helps close up
that wound before you bleed out too much further.

02:41:09.184 --> 02:41:12.659
SAM: I'm going to run back and see what was back
over there.

02:41:12.659 --> 02:41:16.672
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to take a look in the other
room too, and give them a proper look.

02:41:16.672 --> 02:41:22.830
MATT: Glancing into the chamber, that is another
closed gate that is bent inward from the repeated

02:41:22.830 --> 02:41:28.899
slamming of this centurion trying to make its way
in. Looking past the inside, you see four

02:41:28.899 --> 02:41:30.885
decomposed bodies.

02:41:30.885 --> 02:41:32.753
SAM: Can I open the thing?

02:41:32.753 --> 02:41:34.932
MATT: Make an attempt to do so.

02:41:34.932 --> 02:41:37.142
TALIESIN: Liam, you get ten hit points, and you
get 12.

02:41:37.142 --> 02:41:38.931
MARISHA: Dope.

02:41:39.272 --> 02:41:40.575
LIAM: Who gets what now?

02:41:40.575 --> 02:41:41.611
TALIESIN: You get ten.

02:41:41.611 --> 02:41:42.693
MARISHA: I get 12.

02:41:42.693 --> 02:41:43.497
SAM: 13.

02:41:43.497 --> 02:41:44.893
LIAM: From Jester?

02:41:44.893 --> 02:41:46.058
TALIESIN: From Jester.

02:41:46.058 --> 02:41:50.253
MATT: These prison locks are a pain in the butt.
You haven't encountered something quite so heavily

02:41:50.253 --> 02:41:51.960
fortified as these cells.

02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:54.756
SAM: Caleb, I need you to come open this door.

02:41:54.756 --> 02:41:57.802
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over to the door and
start beating it with a sword.

02:41:57.802 --> 02:41:59.888
MATT: Okay, make a strength check.

02:41:59.888 --> 02:42:03.936
TALIESIN: You can't dex cut this thing? You can't
pop it in?

02:42:03.936 --> 02:42:05.969
MATT: No, you have to force it.

02:42:05.969 --> 02:42:08.071
SAM: Yasha, I need you to come kick in this door.

02:42:08.071 --> 02:42:10.699
ASHLEY: If this big thing couldn't kick it in, how
could I?

02:42:10.699 --> 02:42:11.500
LIAM: I'm coming.

02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:12.177
SAM: You're bigger.

02:42:12.177 --> 02:42:13.004
TALIESIN: Eight.

02:42:13.004 --> 02:42:14.774
MATT: It is not budging.

02:42:14.774 --> 02:42:17.689
SAM: You're bigger in spirit and heart.

02:42:17.689 --> 02:42:20.477
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll come and try to open the door.

02:42:20.477 --> 02:42:24.705
MATT: You go over, see where Molly has failed, and
you go and try to fill that void. Make a strength check.

02:42:24.708 --> 02:42:29.047
SAM: I believe in you. Oh, wait!

02:42:29.047 --> 02:42:30.289
ASHLEY: What?

02:42:30.289 --> 02:42:32.035
TALIESIN: No, go ahead.

02:42:32.473 --> 02:42:36.024
ASHLEY: It's not going to budge.

02:42:36.024 --> 02:42:43.816
SAM: I'm going to use this, Matt. I'm going to try
to bend fate and try to repick the lock.

02:42:43.816 --> 02:42:49.097
MATT: Okay. It's a little late, but I'll allow it,
sure.

02:42:49.097 --> 02:42:50.117
SAM: I know.

02:42:50.117 --> 02:42:52.887
MATT: Why not? Go for it.

02:42:52.887 --> 02:42:54.649
SAM: It's a lot.

02:42:54.649 --> 02:42:57.350
(laughter)

02:42:57.350 --> 02:42:58.284
SAM: It's 26.

02:42:58.284 --> 02:43:03.822
MATT: 26, okay. As Yasha comes forward and slams
her foot into it, it jostles the lock just enough

02:43:03.822 --> 02:43:09.103
for you to slip past the tumblers, and with a
(creaks) it opens a few inches on the inside. The

02:43:09.103 --> 02:43:13.430
bottom of it is scraping against the stonework,
the way it's been bashed and bent has actually

02:43:13.430 --> 02:43:18.581
forced it out of the frame of the door, and it's
going to take a bit more force to push it open

02:43:18.581 --> 02:43:20.403
enough to move inside, but you manage to do so.

02:43:20.403 --> 02:43:22.377
TALIESIN: The three of us will get that door
open.

02:43:22.377 --> 02:43:28.421
LIAM: Caleb stops mid-somatic gesture and says,
"Ah, fuck this," and goes back to the first door

02:43:28.421 --> 02:43:29.708
and has a short rest.

02:43:29.708 --> 02:43:30.304
MATT: Okay.

02:43:30.304 --> 02:43:38.603
MARISHA: Yeah, Beau is going to deliriously--
still really messed up, like a drunk person doing

02:43:38.603 --> 02:43:46.084
a pointless task-- is going to try and scoop up
some ball bearings that she threw, and then after

02:43:46.084 --> 02:43:48.484
maybe she picks up like ten--

02:43:48.484 --> 02:43:49.861
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:43:49.861 --> 02:43:50.627
MARISHA: Okay.

02:43:50.627 --> 02:43:55.794
LIAM: Eins, zwei, drei, vier.

02:43:55.794 --> 02:43:57.300
MARISHA: 12?

02:43:57.300 --> 02:43:58.907
MATT: How many ball bearings did you throw out?

02:43:58.907 --> 02:44:03.259
MARISHA: I tossed my baggie--

02:44:03.259 --> 02:44:04.505
MATT: Your entire bag?

02:44:04.505 --> 02:44:11.646
MARISHA: My pouch. And did one of these things. So
I'm going to get my pouch back, and then--

02:44:11.955 --> 02:44:18.425
MATT: Okay. You get your pouch back and you manage
to scoop up-- you have, we'll say, 814 ball bearings.

02:44:18.845 --> 02:44:19.606
MARISHA: Okay.

02:44:19.606 --> 02:44:23.232
MATT: (laughs) Most of which because it's such a
ridiculous item.

02:44:23.232 --> 02:44:26.648
MARISHA: Then after I, deliriously tired of
scooping up ball bearings, I'm going to stumble

02:44:26.648 --> 02:44:29.882
back and collapse next to Caleb and also take a
short rest.

02:44:29.882 --> 02:44:30.798
MATT: Okay.

02:44:30.798 --> 02:44:38.696
ASHLEY: May I go over and see the room where this
thing was staying in, on the other side?

02:44:38.696 --> 02:44:40.666
MATT: Sure, so you make your way to the opposite
end.

02:44:40.666 --> 02:44:42.563
SAM: Anything near the bodies?

02:44:42.563 --> 02:44:43.867
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:44:43.867 --> 02:44:45.997
SAM: This I'm good at. One.

02:44:45.997 --> 02:44:50.382
(laughter)

02:44:50.382 --> 02:44:59.195
MATT: You find-- at first you think it's dried
compost, but you eventually realize, no, it's just

02:44:59.195 --> 02:45:01.181
very old human excrement.

02:45:01.181 --> 02:45:01.911
MARISHA: Ooh.

02:45:01.911 --> 02:45:06.267
TALIESIN: At some point we'll cast Detect Magic--

02:45:06.267 --> 02:45:07.770
MATT: You found prison poop.

02:45:07.770 --> 02:45:08.696
SAM: Old prison poop.

02:45:08.696 --> 02:45:13.738
MATT: Yes. Yasha, you head off to the other side
where the gate is open, and as you go inside, you

02:45:13.738 --> 02:45:19.697
can see the interior of this chamber is as scraped
up as the rest of them from where this sentry was

02:45:19.697 --> 02:45:31.145
attempting to scan and break out. On the inside--
make an investigation check? First time for you?

02:45:31.145 --> 02:45:34.661
ASHLEY: I think it is. 11.

02:45:34.661 --> 02:45:41.424
MATT: 11, okay. Looking around on the inside, you
take a glance-- and there are these little pieces

02:45:41.424 --> 02:45:46.073
of things everywhere, some hard, some soft, and
you start pulling it up, and you notice that a lot

02:45:46.073 --> 02:45:56.322
of these are tiny torn slivers of blanket or sheet
or pillow, and the other hard pieces are tiny

02:45:56.322 --> 02:46:05.073
shards of bone. Whatever prisoners who were in
here who could not keep this at bay, their remains

02:46:05.073 --> 02:46:11.496
have been, time and time again, ground, battered,
and destroyed by this creature as it ran through.

02:46:11.496 --> 02:46:17.151
It has torn apart their bedding and their bodies,
but beyond that, nothing else of interest.

02:46:17.151 --> 02:46:28.179
LIAM: Back at the front gate, leaning against
Beauregard: Eh, what is that? Is that your blood--

02:46:28.179 --> 02:46:30.614
or is that mine?

02:46:30.614 --> 02:46:35.414
MARISHA: (slurring) I don't know, it might be
yours. It's hard to tell.

02:46:35.414 --> 02:46:37.038
LIAM: (snoring)

02:46:37.038 --> 02:46:44.284
MATT: Fjord pats you on the shoulder next to you
and goes, "Hey, I just wanted to let you know, I

02:46:44.284 --> 02:46:50.145
"appreciate what you did, taking the brunt of it,
because it didn't even hurt me."

02:46:50.145 --> 02:46:53.622
MARISHA: (slurring) That's very true. I'm going to
remember that next time.

02:46:53.622 --> 02:46:56.295
MATT: "And that's because of you."

02:46:56.295 --> 02:46:58.292
MARISHA: (slurring) You're the best, Fjord.

02:46:58.292 --> 02:47:02.389
MATT: "I know." All righty, so what else are you
guys doing?

02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:08.549
SAM: Should we retrieve the magic core or anything
as proof of what we did here?

02:47:08.549 --> 02:47:11.779
TALIESIN: I mean, the fact that we're going to
leave the door open and it's not coming up, but

02:47:11.779 --> 02:47:15.590
yeah, we'll go get the core and I figure we're
going to do a thorough investigation of the whole

02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:18.068
thing once Caleb can do a Detect Magic.

02:47:18.068 --> 02:47:23.737
MATT: Okay. While Caleb's taking a moment to
finish his short rest, you begin to peer inside

02:47:24.048 --> 02:47:28.089
and pull back some of the loosened armor plates.
Now that the machine is open, there's not tension

02:47:28.089 --> 02:47:33.081
holding it together, and you see that each of
these armored plates, on the inside, are attached

02:47:33.081 --> 02:47:43.661
to its own arm-like pole. Once it collapsed, all
the armor plates went limp and fell open. It's a

02:47:43.661 --> 02:47:48.591
tension-held bit of armor, that it could expand
and push out different areas to leave openings and

02:47:48.591 --> 02:47:53.783
then retract again. It's a pretty ingenious
design, and you can see why Tinkertop is a

02:47:53.783 --> 02:48:00.333
talented man, though flawed sometimes in his
designs. This is pretty revolutionary.

02:48:00.333 --> 02:48:03.462
TALIESIN: It's like a weaponized version of one of
those balls that you throw up in the air and it

02:48:03.462 --> 02:48:04.395
turns inside out.

02:48:04.395 --> 02:48:10.400
MATT: Similar to that, I guess you could say.
Looking inside, it's hundreds of these little

02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:16.506
poles, and gears, and little servos, and a lot of
them are ground, bent, and damaged from the impact

02:48:16.506 --> 02:48:23.210
that you left inside. There in the center, you see
a cracked open, and partially destroyed, bluish

02:48:23.210 --> 02:48:28.700
crystal sphere. That was where your final blow
impacted to destroy it.

02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:32.043
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep cutting off the arms
so we can get to it.

02:48:32.043 --> 02:48:41.147
MATT: It's yanking and bending pieces, pulling
them out and (pinging). On the inside, with the

02:48:41.147 --> 02:48:45.858
damage you've done, it's not too hard to pry a few
off, but you manage to get to it, and there is the

02:48:45.858 --> 02:48:47.708
cracked and shattered crystal core.

02:48:47.708 --> 02:48:59.262
ASHLEY: Couple questions. I really like some of
the armor pieces that he has on his shoulders,

02:48:59.262 --> 02:49:04.545
like with the skulls and things. Is that just part
of his--

02:49:04.545 --> 02:49:09.405
MATT: That's just part of the miniature. That was
my representation for it. I did not have a mini of

02:49:09.405 --> 02:49:14.654
a spherical ball made of armor. I'm sorry, that's
the best I could do for size and intimidation.

02:49:14.654 --> 02:49:19.499
I've been very busy, didn't have time to make an
entire mini of a tiny spherical metal ball covered

02:49:19.499 --> 02:49:20.074
in blades.

02:49:20.074 --> 02:49:21.598
TALIESIN: What could you have possibly have been
doing, Matt? Sorry!

02:49:21.598 --> 02:49:22.504
MATT: Sorry, no. It's fine.

02:49:22.504 --> 02:49:24.429
MARISHA: Your mustache is traveling.

02:49:24.429 --> 02:49:32.517
SAM: Wherever it stays. Well, let's take this
stuff back up to the warden?

02:49:32.517 --> 02:49:38.363
TALIESIN: We've had a short rest, and we'll do a
quick search. Can you do a Detect Magic spell, Caleb?

02:49:38.374 --> 02:49:45.348
LIAM: Yeah, I have a little bit left in me,
Mollymauk. Will you help me up, please?

02:49:45.348 --> 02:49:47.376
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah come on, that's all right.

02:49:47.376 --> 02:49:49.637
MARISHA: No, he's my pillow! Fuck you, Molly.

02:49:49.637 --> 02:49:51.740
TALIESIN: Go fuck yourself, Beau. Come on.

02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:56.275
LIAM: (grunting) Okay. Point me at the thing.

02:49:56.275 --> 02:50:01.946
MATT: You do a scan of Detect Magic through the
room over the next 15 minutes or so. You do a

02:50:01.946 --> 02:50:08.283
thorough pass around. Nothing magical catches your
attention. Most of the interior here is--

02:50:08.283 --> 02:50:16.774
Actually, no, that's not true. Very faint magical
auras from two ember light torches that are on the

02:50:16.774 --> 02:50:22.188
wall. That faint red light that you've seen is
essentially a very low light Everburning torch.

02:50:22.188 --> 02:50:31.433
LIAM: I turn to Mollymauk and say: Yeah, the only
thing magical here is you, friend. Pat pat on the

02:50:31.433 --> 02:50:36.490
cheek. I wander back over to Beauregard, and I go
to sleep again.

02:50:36.490 --> 02:50:39.786
TALIESIN: All right, come on, we're going to get
you guys out of here. (strained) We're going to go.

02:50:39.786 --> 02:50:41.813
MARISHA: (groaning) Okay.

02:50:41.813 --> 02:50:46.837
MATT: You pick yourselves up, and make your way
back to the heavy metal door. On this side, you

02:50:46.837 --> 02:50:55.039
can see the heavy scraping across it as this ball
has also been pushing repeatedly into this one

02:50:55.039 --> 02:51:00.495
exit point. As you approach, it is still closed
and presumably locked.

02:51:00.495 --> 02:51:06.673
SAM: (knocking) We're done. Let us out. Guards!

02:51:06.673 --> 02:51:10.504
MATT: You hear some shifting behind it, and
eventually hear the familiar grinding of chains

02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:21.449
against metal. (creaking) It opens slightly and
the guards peer out. "You alive?"

02:51:21.449 --> 02:51:25.215
TALIESIN: I hold up the glowing crystal. You
should see the other one. (laughs)

02:51:25.215 --> 02:51:28.982
MATT: "Go check it out." A few of the gnomish
guards push past and head down. Another one of the

02:51:28.993 --> 02:51:38.869
gnomish guards goes, "Well, fucking A. Is it
done?" The other gnomes rush past him and say,

02:51:38.869 --> 02:51:46.221
"Sure enough. They killed the thing!" He's like,
"Oh, all right. I'll lead you back to our boss.

02:51:46.221 --> 02:51:48.477
"Come on, follow me."

02:51:48.477 --> 02:51:59.919
MARISHA: Beauregard goes: I just-- it took a lot
out of us. I pass out in Yasha's arms.

02:51:59.919 --> 02:52:01.304
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:52:01.304 --> 02:52:02.475
MARISHA: Yasha?

02:52:02.475 --> 02:52:03.573
TALIESIN: Do I buy this?

02:52:03.573 --> 02:52:04.418
MARISHA: You have to carry me.

02:52:04.418 --> 02:52:05.806
ASHLEY: I got you.

02:52:05.806 --> 02:52:08.231
MATT: Fireman carries you.

02:52:08.231 --> 02:52:13.250
TALIESIN: I want to have an insight versus
deception check on you.

02:52:13.250 --> 02:52:14.477
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:52:14.477 --> 02:52:22.227
TALIESIN: All right. I ain’t going to mess with
you, I just want to know. Nope, that's an eight.

02:52:22.227 --> 02:52:23.234
Unless you roll really poorly.

02:52:23.234 --> 02:52:26.352
ASHLEY: As I'm holding her--

02:52:26.352 --> 02:52:29.029
MARISHA: I rolled way better.

02:52:29.029 --> 02:52:31.234
ASHLEY: --I will cast Healing
Hands.

02:52:31.288 --> 02:52:35.819
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for that.

02:52:35.819 --> 02:52:43.094
ASHLEY: Regain number of hit points equal to
your level. So you gain an extra five hit points.

02:52:43.256 --> 02:52:46.119
MARISHA: You make me feel so warm inside.

02:52:46.119 --> 02:52:49.724
TALIESIN: Come on, Nott.

02:52:49.724 --> 02:52:50.907
MARISHA: How many hit points?

02:52:50.907 --> 02:52:52.420
MATT: Five.

02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:53.529
ASHLEY: A whole five.

02:52:53.529 --> 02:52:56.218
SAM: On our way out, do I see my bolt anywhere?

02:52:56.218 --> 02:53:00.319
MATT: Make an investigation check as you glance
around the space.

02:53:00.319 --> 02:53:02.154
SAM: 12.

02:53:02.154 --> 02:53:09.797
MATT: Because it's a small space, you do manage to
recover it, so you get one bolt back. It did not trigger.

02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:11.749
SAM: It only triggers if it hits?

02:53:11.749 --> 02:53:16.879
MATT: If it hits an intended target, possibly, or
something hard enough. You rolled low enough where

02:53:16.879 --> 02:53:21.531
it didn't seem to truly impact.

02:53:21.531 --> 02:53:24.082
LIAM: Make a Fu-Manchu check.

02:53:24.082 --> 02:53:29.079
MATT: You guys slowly make your way, guided back
by the various guards of the Gearhold Prison, to

02:53:29.079 --> 02:53:37.259
the office of the Wardenhelm, where both Rissa and
her father are waiting. As they walk in, you

02:53:37.259 --> 02:53:44.698
glance over and can see Cleff. He’s like, "So
how'd it go? Any luck with the thing? Oh, you

02:53:44.698 --> 02:53:46.860
"broke it!"

02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:51.019
TALIESIN: We did. We may need that later, sadly.

02:53:51.019 --> 02:53:57.029
MATT: "I'm simultaneously impressed and kind of
sad, but impressed mostly."

02:53:57.029 --> 02:53:59.006
TALIESIN: It did work us over quite well.

02:53:59.006 --> 02:54:01.134
SAM: It was an incredible device.

02:54:01.134 --> 02:54:02.360
ASHLEY: It really was.

02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:07.507
SAM: You could have told us the eye had a
protective windshield wiper device.

02:54:07.507 --> 02:54:11.756
MATT: "It's more for when it's raining. I didn't
think it would be for tar, but good to know." He

02:54:11.756 --> 02:54:13.607
takes out the note in his little pad.

02:54:13.607 --> 02:54:17.531
TALIESIN: I'm going to take the crystal back. I'm
so sorry, we may need this.

02:54:17.531 --> 02:54:25.606
MATT: At this point, you see turning in the office
vicinity, Wardenhelm Poppin turns and goes, "It

02:54:25.606 --> 02:54:31.401
"appears my guards say you are successful in this.
That is very good. I am impressed. What is your

02:54:31.401 --> 02:54:33.570
"names, if I might be of curious?"

02:54:33.570 --> 02:54:35.085
MARISHA: We're The Mighty Nein.

02:54:35.085 --> 02:54:39.235
MATT: "The Mighty Nein. All right. Good to know
that The Mighty Nein can be relied upon in such

02:54:39.235 --> 02:54:43.694
"situations. Are you staying in town for quite a
while?"

02:54:43.694 --> 02:54:47.264
MARISHA: I don't know how long we might be staying
in town, so maybe we should go ahead and talk

02:54:47.264 --> 02:54:50.051
about that deal while we're here?

02:54:50.051 --> 02:54:55.622
MATT: "Right. While you were down there, I got
approval for about 200 gold from the Starosta for

02:54:55.622 --> 02:54:58.321
"payment. I hope that is enough?"

02:54:58.321 --> 02:55:00.570
MARISHA: To get out the Schusters?

02:55:00.570 --> 02:55:03.643
TALIESIN: He doesn't know about the Schusters.

02:55:03.643 --> 02:55:06.833
MARISHA: Oh. But you talked about getting people
out.

02:55:06.833 --> 02:55:11.275
TALIESIN: No, we mentioned vaguely that we might
want something.

02:55:11.275 --> 02:55:13.838
MATT: "I am curious as to what you are referring
to."

02:55:13.838 --> 02:55:22.638
TALIESIN: We have some friends that are currently
interred here for financial troubles? Nothing

02:55:22.638 --> 02:55:30.927
dangerous, nothing violent. We were wondering if
we could make a deal for maybe some leniency. If

02:55:30.927 --> 02:55:32.269
that's possible.

02:55:32.269 --> 02:55:36.607
MARISHA: Take that 200 gold, consider it their
bail and time served.

02:55:36.607 --> 02:55:42.266
TALIESIN: Also, we do have a bit of the mechanism,
and if everybody here is all right, I am of the

02:55:42.266 --> 02:55:48.821
opinion that if anybody asks us, it was your
brilliant idea to let us into that cell in the

02:55:48.821 --> 02:55:53.295
first place to take care of this problem. If
anybody asks, we know who is absolutely

02:55:53.295 --> 02:55:55.395
responsible for this.

02:55:55.395 --> 02:55:57.206
LIAM: You picked us specifically.

02:55:57.206 --> 02:55:59.041
SAM: Poppin Drokrusher.

02:55:59.041 --> 02:56:03.258
TALIESIN: You saw something in us. You took a
chance, and we're grateful for it.

02:56:03.258 --> 02:56:07.025
MARISHA: And this guy will agree to that. Right,
Cleff? I elbow Cleff.

02:56:07.025 --> 02:56:17.269
MATT: "Oh! Of course, great deal. Ooh, sternum,
it's a bit pain--" Go ahead and make a persuasion

02:56:17.269 --> 02:56:18.609
check with advantage.

02:56:18.609 --> 02:56:32.242
TALIESIN: All right, come on, man. For fuck's
sake. That's a six.

02:56:32.242 --> 02:56:33.155
MARISHA: Total?

02:56:33.155 --> 02:56:34.679
MATT: A six.

02:56:34.679 --> 02:56:36.879
TALIESIN: I don't have any persuasion. I don't
know why--

02:56:36.879 --> 02:56:39.859
MATT: Why you keep leading these social
encounters?

02:56:39.859 --> 02:56:42.713
TALIESIN: Somebody should pick up, but we don't
have our talker here right now.

02:56:42.713 --> 02:56:49.177
MATT: Well, you got a talker, but that's okay. He
takes a keen look at you, goes over, and starts

02:56:49.177 --> 02:56:53.868
thumbing through papers. Goes through his books,
picks one, and goes, "Schuster, Schuster,

02:56:53.868 --> 02:57:04.012
"Schuster. All right, I found the report here." He
turns the page, "That looks like they were

02:57:04.012 --> 02:57:15.498
"arrested for false idol worship. That is not a
minor offense."

02:57:15.498 --> 02:57:23.445
LIAM: Look at it this way: one path we could take
is that you are the mastermind who hired the right

02:57:23.445 --> 02:57:31.677
people for the job and everything is perfect. The
other path, we talk about how we came in and fixed

02:57:31.677 --> 02:57:33.535
things you could not.

02:57:33.535 --> 02:57:42.650
MATT: "The Schusters are still to serve a two-year
sentence, both of them. To pay the amount to bail

02:57:42.650 --> 02:57:52.646
"them out would be, at this point, about 350 gold.
With the 200 that were offered, that would put you

02:57:52.646 --> 02:58:01.424
"at a 150 bail amount should you wish to indeed pay
for these very important friends of yours."

02:58:01.424 --> 02:58:07.707
MARISHA: Well, considering you have a hunk of
metal down in your basement that is worth at least

02:58:07.707 --> 02:58:12.920
100 gold worth of scrap that I'm sure the Assembly
Yard would love to have--

02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:17.385
MATT: "And they will, because it's still
technically commissioned originally by the prison,

02:58:17.385 --> 02:58:25.428
"so we own the rights to its carcass. However, the
moment of negotiation is over. This is my price as

02:58:25.428 --> 02:58:30.793
"it stands. Either you receive the 200 and walk
away, or you can continue to pay the bail and they

02:58:30.793 --> 02:58:32.675
"will be released. That is up to you--"

02:58:32.675 --> 02:58:40.416
LIAM: Ja, I think that’s a fair deal. Jester,
would you mind settling this debt for us?

02:58:40.416 --> 02:58:42.958
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's no problem. Jester will be
happy to pay.

02:58:42.958 --> 02:58:46.527
(laughter)

02:58:46.527 --> 02:58:47.406
TALIESIN: 150 gold?

02:58:47.406 --> 02:58:48.393
MATT: 150 gold.

02:58:48.393 --> 02:58:49.750
TALIESIN: Laura, you can text right now.

02:58:49.750 --> 02:58:51.703
ASHLEY: Oh no!

02:58:51.703 --> 02:58:54.569
TALIESIN: That's okay. Laura will text if she has
a problem with that.

02:58:54.569 --> 02:58:57.179
MARISHA: Fjord can foot half, since he's
sympathetic.

02:58:57.179 --> 02:58:58.884
TALIESIN: Fjord will pay half! So 75 gold each.

02:58:58.884 --> 02:59:00.202
MATT: That's true.

02:59:00.202 --> 02:59:03.481
MARISHA; Fjord says, "You know what? To keep them
out of that orphanage?"

02:59:03.481 --> 02:59:06.258
LIAM: Your gold, Laura, or your maternal bond. You
choose!

02:59:06.258 --> 02:59:09.251
TALIESIN: Seven. Okay. So that's all right. Bump
bump. Oh, and look at that! It's all done! Look at

02:59:09.251 --> 02:59:11.252
that, it's all done. That all happened!

02:59:11.252 --> 02:59:12.420
MATT: Look at that. It's beautiful.

02:59:12.420 --> 02:59:14.326
MARISHA: He's like, "No money was spent!"

02:59:14.326 --> 02:59:15.595
TALIESIN: It's as if it never was!

02:59:15.595 --> 02:59:19.096
ASHLEY: What a bunch of assholes.

02:59:19.096 --> 02:59:21.483
TALIESIN: That's what you get for getting knocked
up, man. Right there. Sorry.

02:59:21.483 --> 02:59:23.785
(laughter)

02:59:23.785 --> 02:59:24.829
MATT: At this point, he--

02:59:24.829 --> 02:59:26.330
MARISHA: Kids are expensive!

02:59:26.330 --> 02:59:28.653
TALIESIN: Kids are a deep financial drain, man!

02:59:28.653 --> 02:59:29.925
MATT: It's true!

02:59:29.925 --> 02:59:31.238
LIAM: Man, don't I know it.

02:59:31.238 --> 02:59:37.032
MATT: He accepts the coin, shouts out to-- he
says, "Micahl!" And this female halfling comes

02:59:37.032 --> 02:59:42.525
rushing in. He says, "I would like for you to
write a writ for me of success in clearing the

02:59:42.525 --> 02:59:53.439
"lower regions of the prison under the watchful eye
of the Wardenhelm Poppin Drokrusher. I thank you.

02:59:53.439 --> 03:00:00.506
"And also, could we please have sent up immediately
a," he leans forward, "Gilda and Wallace Schuster.

03:00:00.506 --> 03:00:11.545
"They are on the second level in cell 12B. They
have had their bail paid." The halfling rushes

03:00:11.545 --> 03:00:16.471
off, some of the guards leave with her, and about
20 or so minutes later you hear the footsteps

03:00:16.471 --> 03:00:33.561
return and there you see this couple. They pull
forward, dirty, sallow, not very well-fed, but

03:00:33.561 --> 03:00:42.196
alive, and they both look bewildered. The man,
who's got a thick graying brown scruff and the

03:00:42.196 --> 03:00:52.930
hair a bit shaken from his form, he glances up at
the rest of you. "I don't understand what's happening."

03:00:52.930 --> 03:00:54.688
SAM: It's all right.

03:00:54.740 --> 03:00:56.621
TALIESIN: We never understand what's happening,
either.

03:00:56.621 --> 03:00:59.817
MARISHA: Gilda? Wallace?

03:00:59.817 --> 03:01:08.394
MATT: The woman looks over. She has this long,
curled, and tangled brownish-red hair. She goes,

03:01:08.394 --> 03:01:14.800
"Is this true? We're free?"

03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:17.333
MARISHA: Why don't we get outside and then we'll
talk?

03:01:17.333 --> 03:01:18.813
SAM: Let's have a meat pie.

03:01:18.813 --> 03:01:21.205
(laughter)

03:01:21.205 --> 03:01:29.021
MATT: With that, you guide the now
no-longer-prisoners outside of the Gearhold

03:01:29.021 --> 03:01:35.908
Prison, and as the small door opens to lead them
out into the late afternoon air, the sunlight hits

03:01:35.908 --> 03:01:42.418
them. And you see them blink and wince, and then
look up and smile, as this is probably the first

03:01:42.418 --> 03:01:48.590
sunlight they've seen in six months. You can see a
bit of glimmer as tears begin to form at the edge

03:01:48.590 --> 03:01:55.227
of their eyes and the two, the couple, look at
each other and smile, and hold each other, and

03:01:55.227 --> 03:02:03.933
look back at the group of you and say, "Thank you,
but why?"

03:02:03.933 --> 03:02:08.143
MARISHA: Let's just say your kids made an
impression on us.

03:02:08.143 --> 03:02:10.792
MATT: "Are they all right? Where are they?"

03:02:10.792 --> 03:02:18.500
SAM: They're at your house, the butcher place?
Don't worry, we'll take you there. They're being

03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:23.654
kept safe by a tiny bird with a dagger.

03:02:23.654 --> 03:02:31.328
MATT: They look at you, and look both frightened
by the words you say, and then equally frightened

03:02:31.328 --> 03:02:37.428
by the creature they now realize that is saying
it, and go, "Right, right."

03:02:37.428 --> 03:02:39.391
TALIESIN: Best not to think about it.

03:02:39.391 --> 03:02:45.650
SAM: Sometimes the people that help you are the
least expected.

03:02:45.659 --> 03:02:49.016
MARISHA: I was going to say eclectic, but sure.

03:02:49.016 --> 03:02:51.867
MATT: "Thank you."

03:02:51.867 --> 03:02:55.635
LIAM: Thank heavens for little blessings.

03:02:55.635 --> 03:03:00.686
MATT: "Thank you very much. Can we go to our
children, please?"

03:03:00.686 --> 03:03:02.232
ALL: Yes.

03:03:02.232 --> 03:03:09.934
MATT: With that, you guys all make your way back
up the switchback path to the Idleworks Shelf,

03:03:09.934 --> 03:03:19.034
just as the sun begins to hit the mountains, the
skies turning to the oranges and reds of the

03:03:19.034 --> 03:03:27.836
coming sunset. At this point, the people of the
city begin to rise in energy once more as the

03:03:27.836 --> 03:03:33.067
whistles of a day's work come to a close. The city
beings to liven up once more into an air of

03:03:33.067 --> 03:03:37.601
celebration, music blasting around you on all
sides.

03:03:37.601 --> 03:03:45.131
MARISHA: It's like being in Vegas for more than 24
hours. You're like, "No! Not again! I can't do

03:03:45.131 --> 03:03:48.602
"this for a third night in a row! Ugh!"

03:03:48.602 --> 03:03:51.621
TALIESIN: Roll for dubstep.

03:03:51.621 --> 03:03:57.103
MATT: As you guys push through the streets now,
the celebration expanding and exploding throughout

03:03:57.103 --> 03:04:02.486
the vicinity, your still-lingering hangovers from
the night before, mixed with your physically

03:04:02.486 --> 03:04:08.935
damaged selves, make you less jovial in this
space. Eventually you make your way to the back to

03:04:08.935 --> 03:04:18.382
the location of the previously boarded-up butcher
shop. It appears to be left alone, closed, locked,

03:04:18.382 --> 03:04:20.585
and as you left it.

03:04:20.585 --> 03:04:23.061
(whistling) (knocking)

03:04:23.061 --> 03:04:26.620
MARISHA: Oh, your way was way more cool.

03:04:26.620 --> 03:04:30.991
(whistling) (knocking)

03:04:33.631 --> 03:04:36.484
TALIESIN: It's us. Open it up!

03:04:36.544 --> 03:04:45.502
MATT: You hear some shuffling and the door opens.
Austin and Gail look past and open the door. As

03:04:45.502 --> 03:04:56.216
soon as Gail can say, "You're back--" they look,
and you can see their parents, right there, smile

03:04:56.216 --> 03:05:02.428
back at them. With that, they rush out, Gail and
Austin, and wrap their arms around their mother

03:05:02.428 --> 03:05:09.660
and father. Behind them, skittering, Layla and
Jude look past, and they run up as well and hold

03:05:09.660 --> 03:05:18.583
them. Now this family unit of six all brought
together again, as filthy as they may be in their

03:05:18.583 --> 03:05:28.194
current garb and lifestyle, hold themselves
amongst the glowing of distant fireworks going

03:05:28.194 --> 03:05:37.627
off, an unknowing celebration that the city holds
for this family. Behind, you see Kiri shuffle out,

03:05:37.627 --> 03:05:43.461
see what's happening, then also come forward and
put her arms around the family and looks back at

03:05:43.461 --> 03:05:47.451
you with a smile. (like Jester) "Yes, I am a good
girl."

03:05:47.451 --> 03:05:50.419
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness.

03:05:55.669 --> 03:05:57.712
MARISHA: This is making me really emotional.

03:05:57.712 --> 03:06:02.478
LIAM: This could be our chance to find a good home
for her.

03:06:02.478 --> 03:06:04.547
SAM: Yes!

03:06:04.547 --> 03:06:09.614
MATT: Kiri steps away from the group, looks at the
rest of you, takes the dagger out, steps forward

03:06:09.614 --> 03:06:14.343
and goes, (like Nott) "The Mighty Nein!"

03:06:14.343 --> 03:06:19.486
MARISHA: Kiri. (exhales)

03:06:19.486 --> 03:06:23.601
LIAM: You like these kids, Kiri?

03:06:23.601 --> 03:06:25.786
MATT: (like Jester) "Okay."

03:06:25.786 --> 03:06:26.966
LIAM: Ja?

03:06:26.966 --> 03:06:27.886
MATT: (like Caleb) "Ja."

03:06:27.886 --> 03:06:34.902
LIAM: You know, you spend enough time with us--
Beauregard and I here almost died tonight. You're

03:06:34.902 --> 03:06:45.428
just a little girl. You should be playing with
these kids, not playing with us. What about you,

03:06:45.428 --> 03:06:48.024
Mom and Dad?

03:06:48.024 --> 03:06:51.654
MATT: At this point, they're barely paying
attention. They look back and say,

03:06:51.712 --> 03:06:58.228
"I'm sorry, what?"

03:06:58.228 --> 03:06:59.917
TALIESIN: We have a request.

03:06:59.917 --> 03:07:03.464
MARISHA: A favor. In return--

03:07:03.464 --> 03:07:07.708
LIAM: In exchange-- Beauregard.

03:07:07.708 --> 03:07:11.948
MARISHA: No, you were nailing it. We did a jinxies
thing, yeah.

03:07:11.948 --> 03:07:20.002
MATT: Fjord steps in next to you as well, and
goes, "Look, no children should be without their

03:07:20.002 --> 03:07:35.057
"parents, and we're happy to have brought you back
together. Be more careful. Make sure that if you

03:07:35.057 --> 03:07:46.158
"do anything that could put your kids at risk,
don't." He looks over and defers back to you, Caleb.

03:07:54.586 --> 03:08:05.383
LIAM: We get into trouble quite a bit. I feel
guilty bringing this young girl with us. We've

03:08:05.383 --> 03:08:16.584
gone to great lengths to get you out and all-- I
can't speak for the group, but all I ask is that

03:08:16.642 --> 03:08:24.323
you give this girl some parents.

03:08:24.323 --> 03:08:29.723
MARISHA: Fjord's right. No child should be
separated from their parents. Unfortunately, this

03:08:29.723 --> 03:08:34.135
little one was.

03:08:34.135 --> 03:08:42.504
MATT: The parents look at each other, and down at
the kids. The little girl, Layla, with her curled

03:08:42.504 --> 03:08:51.485
red hair, goes, "Does this mean she can stay?" and
looks over at Kiri. Kiri looks between them and

03:08:51.485 --> 03:09:02.973
you, and looks temporarily conflicted and
confused, but you can see a bit of understanding

03:09:02.973 --> 03:09:18.160
wash over. Kiri reaches over and takes from her
pocket the dagger, steps forward, and turns it

03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:23.147
around, handle forward. Holds it out.

03:09:23.147 --> 03:09:26.490
MARISHA: You've learned.

03:09:26.490 --> 03:09:40.250
MATT: (like Jester) "Yes, I am very sweet." She
reaches down, and pulls out the music box. Slowly

03:09:40.250 --> 03:09:44.972
opens it after winding it.

03:09:44.972 --> 03:09:50.129
[music box plays]

03:09:50.129 --> 03:09:55.347
TALIESIN: Oh, that's just mean.

03:09:55.347 --> 03:10:01.788
MATT: (like Caleb) "She's a pretty good egg."
Looks up at Caleb and rushes forward, and gives a

03:10:01.788 --> 03:10:08.485
big, warm hug.

03:10:08.485 --> 03:10:23.837
MARISHA: Shit. I turn to Gilda and Wallace and
say: Look, I know another mouth to feed is a lot.

03:10:23.837 --> 03:10:32.060
It would mean a lot if you take her, but we'll
help you out. I reach in and I give them 50 gold

03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:42.339
from my stash. Should be enough to help for a
little bit. Hopefully make up the difference.

03:10:42.339 --> 03:10:47.116
MATT: She accepts it, wide-eyed. "I don't know
what to say."

03:10:47.169 --> 03:10:52.982
MARISHA: Well, I stole 75 gold from my friend
without him being here to speak for it, so I feel

03:10:52.982 --> 03:10:56.535
like it's fair.

03:11:00.290 --> 03:11:03.813
MATT: She steps back, and they look like they're
in shock still from these strangers that have come

03:11:03.813 --> 03:11:17.646
to their aid so heavily. Kiri pulls back and looks
to you. (like Jester) "Don't eat humans, okay?"

03:11:23.536 --> 03:11:28.961
MARISHA: Go give Jester a hug. I know she wished
she'd be here for it.

03:11:29.012 --> 03:11:39.366
MATT: Jester, you see her arms twisted up and the
eyes filled with water and she goes, "Oh! We're

03:11:39.366 --> 03:11:41.700
"going to come back, right?"

03:11:41.700 --> 03:11:50.860
SAM: Yes, we'll come back and check on Kiri. Be a
good girl, Kiri.

03:11:50.860 --> 03:11:56.030
MATT: She gives a big hug and goes, "Kiri, you're
going to be so beautiful as you grow up, and this

03:11:56.030 --> 03:12:01.003
"family is going to take care of you and is going
to be your new mother and father and you’ll have

03:12:01.003 --> 03:12:05.601
"this whole family here for you. Remember that no
matter what's happening and what you are doing,

03:12:05.601 --> 03:12:18.660
"the Traveler is always looking over you, and we
are always-- always thinking of you with love."

03:12:18.660 --> 03:12:24.318
Jester turns around, and you can see the tears
welling up in her eyes.

03:12:24.318 --> 03:12:26.399
MARISHA: I give Jester a hug.

03:12:26.399 --> 03:12:37.341
MATT: She takes you in there. Fjord steps forward
and ruffles the feathers on the head and says,

03:12:37.341 --> 03:12:46.166
"You're always a member. Maybe one day, you'll be
able to come back and use that dagger for

03:12:46.166 --> 03:13:04.017
something that's alive." Kiri turns back and looks
to you. (like Nott) "Yeza was his name."

03:13:04.017 --> 03:13:09.540
SAM: I guess everyone knows at this point, so it's
okay now.

03:13:09.540 --> 03:13:10.780
MATT: She gives you a hug.

03:13:10.780 --> 03:13:16.134
SAM: Thank you for listening to us.

03:13:16.134 --> 03:13:21.125
MATT: Looks to Molly and gives this distant
stare.

03:13:21.125 --> 03:13:25.560
TALIESIN: I'm so glad we understand each other.
Take care of them.

03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:31.548
MATT: (like Molly) "Take care of them." Looks to
you, and comes up and cuddles up against your

03:13:31.548 --> 03:13:36.148
chest where she had slept the night before and
(chirping).

03:13:36.148 --> 03:13:37.910
ASHLEY: Scratch those feathers.

03:13:37.910 --> 03:13:40.955
MATT: The feathers fluff up a bit.

03:13:40.955 --> 03:13:47.609
ASHLEY: Goodbye, Kiri. We will send you treasures
from all of our travels.

03:13:47.609 --> 03:13:49.687
MATT: (like Jester) "Okay."

03:13:49.687 --> 03:13:53.571
ASHLEY: We will miss you very much.

03:13:53.571 --> 03:14:02.244
MATT: Kiri turns back and steps beside the kids.
The family looks out and goes, "If there's ever

03:14:02.244 --> 03:14:09.921
"the opportunity to pay this back or forward, we
will. Thank you."

03:14:09.921 --> 03:14:16.637
MARISHA: You already are. Look at this handsome
lot. You look like you need to be a vinyl decal on

03:14:16.637 --> 03:14:20.397
the back of a minivan.

03:14:20.397 --> 03:14:21.869
LIAM: A what?

03:14:21.869 --> 03:14:26.121
TALIESIN: I'm not even going to go there.

03:14:26.121 --> 03:14:31.482
MATT: More fireworks go off and the whole family
looks up again, and there's a moment where the

03:14:31.482 --> 03:14:40.494
family, as one single unit, pulling Kiri into it,
Gilda looks at them all and says, "It's been a

03:14:40.494 --> 03:14:49.962
"long time since I felt the need to celebrate. How
about we all wash up and go out and take you for

03:14:49.962 --> 03:15:00.192
"flowers?" The kids brighten up, excited, and Kiri
looks up happily and curiously looks back. They

03:15:00.192 --> 03:15:05.832
all shuffle into the house. The last look
as Kiri looks back over her shoulder.

03:15:11.696 --> 03:15:20.598
(like Jester) "I am Kiri." The door closes.

03:15:20.598 --> 03:15:23.709
SAM: That felt really good, guys!

03:15:23.709 --> 03:15:25.924
ASHLEY: It sure did.

03:15:25.924 --> 03:15:27.980
SAM: It's nice being good people.

03:15:27.980 --> 03:15:34.048
MARISHA: That might be the first nice thing I've
ever done.

03:15:34.048 --> 03:15:38.650
TALIESIN: Explains why your face is doing that, I
suppose.

03:15:38.650 --> 03:15:41.435
MARISHA: I don't know what this emotion thing is.
It's weird.

03:15:41.435 --> 03:15:43.053
TALIESIN: It's not a good look on you.

03:15:43.053 --> 03:15:45.518
MARISHA: It probably isn't.

03:15:45.518 --> 03:15:49.524
TALIESIN: Come on, let's go find a quiet place to
sleep. I'm exhausted.

03:15:49.524 --> 03:15:57.418
MATT: Fjord, as you're walking along back to your
inn, goes, "Now, I know y'all did this because I

03:15:57.418 --> 03:16:09.465
"asked you to, and you weren't sure if you wanted
to. I want you to know that's appreciated. You

03:16:09.465 --> 03:16:22.581
"went out on a limb for me and these kids. I'll
remember that. Anyway, come on." As you guys make

03:16:22.581 --> 03:16:30.753
your way back to a more solemn evening, the
celebration is wild. The Blushing Tankard Tavern

03:16:30.753 --> 03:16:38.856
is in the same crazy energy and music you possibly
can expect, but you are too exhausted emotionally

03:16:38.856 --> 03:16:49.010
and physically. You get a drink, find your way
back to your room, and crash out hard.

03:16:49.010 --> 03:16:50.283
TALIESIN: Long rest.

03:16:50.283 --> 03:16:54.672
MATT: Long rest to you all. The next morning you
come to consciousness, your first morning not

03:16:54.672 --> 03:17:02.139
hungover for a lot of you, here in the city of
Hupperdook. Now the city is yours to make your

03:17:02.139 --> 03:17:04.610
final business with.

03:17:06.320 --> 03:17:12.575
SAM: We can do more things in this city?

03:17:12.575 --> 03:17:16.539
MATT: Well, you haven't gotten back to Tinkertop
for your half of the deal.

03:17:16.539 --> 03:17:20.347
SAM: Yes, that's right. I guess we should go visit
Cleff.

03:17:20.347 --> 03:17:22.754
TALIESIN: Get your tinker toy.

03:17:22.754 --> 03:17:27.819
SAM: Who says it's mine? It could be any of ours.
I mean, mine's a little busted, though, so it

03:17:27.819 --> 03:17:28.951
would be nice.

03:17:28.951 --> 03:17:31.550
MATT: As you hold it up, it goes (snapping).

03:17:31.550 --> 03:17:34.920
SAM: I can fix that. Probably.

03:17:34.920 --> 03:17:40.125
TALIESIN: Going to take it away.

03:17:40.125 --> 03:17:45.724
MARISHA: On the way, I look for someone who wasn't
the guy who hated us before selling more of those

03:17:45.724 --> 03:17:50.125
poppers, because I want to stock up before we get
out of this godforsaken town.

03:17:50.125 --> 03:17:52.429
LIAM: I tag along with Beauregard.

03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:54.423
MATT: All right. You get another set of ten.

03:17:54.423 --> 03:17:56.790
MARISHA: Another set of ten. Yeah!

03:17:56.790 --> 03:17:58.203
MATT: I think it was two copper.

03:17:58.203 --> 03:18:00.432
TALIESIN: I will only stop if there's something
interesting in a window. Otherwise, I figure we're

03:18:00.432 --> 03:18:03.321
heading back to pick up the crossbow.

03:18:03.321 --> 03:18:04.966
LIAM: Hey, Beauregard.

03:18:04.966 --> 03:18:06.484
MARISHA: Yeah, Caleb?

03:18:06.484 --> 03:18:12.055
LIAM: That felt pretty good last night. Helping
somebody.

03:18:12.055 --> 03:18:13.896
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

03:18:13.896 --> 03:18:15.808
LIAM: Do something good.

03:18:15.808 --> 03:18:18.468
MARISHA: Yeah, it wasn't too bad.

03:18:18.468 --> 03:18:34.049
LIAM: I get the sense that you have bigger plans
than that, even. Cobalt. Monk. I get a sense.

03:18:34.049 --> 03:18:39.698
MARISHA: Honestly, I don't really have a lot of
plans. My entire life has been plans being made

03:18:39.698 --> 03:18:55.507
for me. So it's nice not having plans. I ran away
from the Cobalt Soul. I have ideas. I don't know

03:18:55.507 --> 03:18:59.154
if ideas would count as plans.

03:18:59.154 --> 03:19:12.526
LIAM: Well, that's just semantics. I have a feel
about you. You and change. I don't think that you

03:19:12.526 --> 03:19:25.801
and I have the same plans, but I think they might
overlap. I would be willing to help you.

03:19:27.694 --> 03:19:37.785
MARISHA: I'd be willing to help you, under one
condition. Can we agree to keep each other straight?

03:19:37.785 --> 03:19:40.955
LIAM: How do you mean?

03:19:40.955 --> 03:19:49.012
MARISHA: If either one of us tries to turn and do
something stupid, or lean a little bit more evil.

03:19:49.012 --> 03:19:51.318
LIAM: Evil?

03:19:51.318 --> 03:19:53.322
MARISHA: Chaotic, whatever you want to call it.

03:19:53.322 --> 03:19:57.132
LIAM: Surely neither of us are evil, Beauregard.

03:19:57.132 --> 03:20:04.545
MARISHA: Anarchists? Let's just make a pact if
either one of us do anything stupid that maybe

03:20:04.545 --> 03:20:09.395
we're each other's failsafes.

03:20:09.395 --> 03:20:13.499
LIAM: Yeah, I like that.

03:20:13.499 --> 03:20:18.490
MARISHA: I don't think I want to hurt any more
people and I don't think you do either, so maybe

03:20:18.490 --> 03:20:31.822
if we keep each other from hurting other people.
That's not true. I do want to hurt people, just

03:20:31.822 --> 03:20:39.424
not people I like. Let's hurt bad guys.

03:20:39.424 --> 03:20:51.804
LIAM: I think I can help you. I think you can help
me. I think we can do some good here.

03:20:51.804 --> 03:20:57.408
MARISHA and LIAM: Deal.

03:20:57.408 --> 03:21:00.855
SAM and MARISHA: Skype high-five!

03:21:00.855 --> 03:21:02.759
MATT and TALIESIN: Skype-five.

03:21:02.759 --> 03:21:04.073
TALIESIN: Skype force five.

03:21:04.073 --> 03:21:06.299
MARISHA: Can you do the-- give me a--

03:21:06.299 --> 03:21:09.403
LIAM: I will do my best, Beauregard.

03:21:09.403 --> 03:21:17.794
MATT: That's amazing. Awesome. As that's
happening, you guys have reached the exterior of

03:21:17.794 --> 03:21:21.632
the Tinkertop Inventions shop.

03:21:21.632 --> 03:21:26.979
TALIESIN: If there was possible to buy some food,
I want to have some camping food for the rest,

03:21:26.979 --> 03:21:28.792
like good stuff.

03:21:28.792 --> 03:21:31.350
MATT: High-quality provisions for the rest of the
trip?

03:21:31.350 --> 03:21:33.583
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, just really good food.

03:21:33.583 --> 03:21:34.670
ASHLEY: Stews.

03:21:34.670 --> 03:21:36.669
TALIESIN: Some meat, veggies. Just (grunts).

03:21:36.669 --> 03:21:39.153
MATT: If you drop a solid two gold--

03:21:39.153 --> 03:21:39.998
TALIESIN: Done!

03:21:39.998 --> 03:21:43.303
MATT: You have good road meals that'll last--

03:21:43.303 --> 03:21:44.921
TALIESIN: We're eating good!

03:21:44.921 --> 03:21:48.372
MATT: Oh, for the whole group? For the whole
group, put five gold down and I'd say you guys

03:21:48.372 --> 03:21:54.388
have some of the finest fucking food you could
have on the road going north. That is good eating.

03:21:54.723 --> 03:21:58.409
TALIESIN: Yep. We're going to be eating really
good.

03:21:58.409 --> 03:22:03.776
MATT: On the outskirts of the Tinkertop Inventions
shack, you make your way on the inside and you

03:22:03.776 --> 03:22:11.321
see, in the process of feverishly sketching out
designs, Cleff Tinkertop barely look up from his

03:22:11.321 --> 03:22:20.081
page. "Oh! Hello, good to see you all again. Thank
you. Thank you for helping with that. I think,

03:22:20.081 --> 03:22:25.555
"based on some of these new designs I'm coming
forward, they might be interested in a new

03:22:25.555 --> 03:22:31.139
"version! Perhaps a new design! Perhaps an update,
if you will, based on the notes you gave me, so

03:22:31.139 --> 03:22:33.114
"here's to hoping!"

03:22:33.114 --> 03:22:36.128
SAM: Okay. Worth a shot.

03:22:37.759 --> 03:22:41.496
MARISHA: Don't know if a lesson was learned here,
but all right, let's continue on.

03:22:41.496 --> 03:22:44.372
TALIESIN: Maybe the lesson was for us. I'm not
sure.

03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:48.820
MATT: "Can I help you with anything?"

03:22:48.820 --> 03:22:56.394
SAM: Well, we just came to say goodbye; we're
probably rolling out of town soon. And, you know,

03:22:56.394 --> 03:23:01.396
I mean, if you had an extra crossbow lying
around.

03:23:01.396 --> 03:23:07.179
MATT: "Ha ha! Right, sorry, I forgot entirely!
I'll be right back." He goes back and rummages and

03:23:07.179 --> 03:23:14.086
pulls out the fantastic, previously displayed
Tinkertop Boltblaster 1000 and goes, "Thank you

03:23:14.086 --> 03:23:20.596
"for your help. I hope it serves you well. By the
way, if there's any problems, if you wouldn't mind

03:23:20.596 --> 03:23:27.087
"making notes, and feel free to mail them off to me
so I can perhaps improve on the next iteration."

03:23:27.087 --> 03:23:30.055
SAM: A beta testing sort of a thing?

03:23:30.055 --> 03:23:32.545
MATT: "If you don't mind. That'd be fantastic."

03:23:32.545 --> 03:23:33.976
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

03:23:33.976 --> 03:23:35.026
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:23:35.026 --> 03:23:36.258
TALIESIN: Ooh, nice.

03:23:36.258 --> 03:23:37.158
SAM: Sure.

03:23:37.158 --> 03:23:38.059
TALIESIN: Woo!

03:23:38.059 --> 03:23:41.207
SAM: Okay. Yes. Ugh.

03:23:41.207 --> 03:23:44.813
TALIESIN: That can happen. That's okay.

03:23:44.813 --> 03:23:46.354
SAM: I love it. It's great.

03:23:46.354 --> 03:23:49.525
TALIESIN: That's very you. It's very you.

03:23:49.525 --> 03:23:52.529
SAM: Thank you. Thank you, Cleff.

03:23:52.529 --> 03:23:56.386
MATT: "Of course, and thank you as well. Wherever
you're off to, safe travels!"

03:23:56.386 --> 03:24:02.567
MARISHA: Cleff, maybe if in the future we come
back and need a repair or something spiffy, you'll

03:24:02.567 --> 03:24:04.948
cut us a deal?

03:24:04.948 --> 03:24:08.086
MATT: "I think something can be arranged. I'll be
here!"

03:24:08.086 --> 03:24:17.591
MARISHA: And hey, I don't know if you know the
Schusters at all, but if you see a family walking

03:24:17.591 --> 03:24:26.265
around, little bird child, maybe watch over them
for us.

03:24:26.265 --> 03:24:31.140
MATT: "That's a very curious series of words
you've strung together, but I'll keep an eye out for you."

03:24:31.140 --> 03:24:33.587
MARISHA: I acknowledge that, and thank you.

03:24:33.587 --> 03:24:35.745
MATT: "Course."

03:24:35.745 --> 03:24:39.295
TALIESIN: Look at you, becoming a people person.
Or at least a bird person.

03:24:39.295 --> 03:24:40.352
MARISHA: Fuck you, Molly.

03:24:40.352 --> 03:24:41.823
TALIESIN: Fuck you, too.

03:24:41.823 --> 03:24:46.089
MATT: "Well, if you're leaving, you should say
bye, Rissa!" Behind him, Rissa sits up with her

03:24:46.089 --> 03:24:50.411
goggles on. She was in the back currently working
on something. Goes, "Oh, right, you're off

03:24:50.411 --> 03:24:52.187
"already? You're leaving?"

03:24:52.187 --> 03:24:53.928
TALIESIN: We got to get on the road.

03:24:53.928 --> 03:24:58.289
MATT: "Oh, well, it's been fun."

03:24:58.289 --> 03:25:04.019
TALIESIN: We can't thank you enough. We'll
definitely come back in contact next time we're

03:25:04.019 --> 03:25:05.467
rolling through town.

03:25:05.467 --> 03:25:12.776
MATT: "Do. Thank you for showing me a good time
and for getting this old coot back to some sort of

03:25:12.776 --> 03:25:15.766
"interesting means of constructive work."

03:25:15.766 --> 03:25:18.937
SAM: I'm sure he's going to invent many new,
excellent devices.

03:25:18.937 --> 03:25:21.864
TALIESIN: We leave her the drinking tokens.

03:25:21.864 --> 03:25:26.595
MATT: She goes, "Well, I mean, drinking by proxy,
I'll certainly take that!"

03:25:26.595 --> 03:25:30.864
TALIESIN: They need use. I think it's fair.

03:25:30.864 --> 03:25:34.395
MATT: "Well. Next time, I'll owe you a round."

03:25:34.395 --> 03:25:37.504
TALIESIN: Very much taking you up on that.

03:25:37.504 --> 03:25:46.084
MATT: "Well, be safe. Take care. And 'til the next
time." As you guys exit, you hear her say, "I

03:25:46.084 --> 03:25:52.300
"don't think this design's going to work, Dad." He
says, "No, trust me!" And the door closes behind you.

03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:54.938
TALIESIN: That's going to end well.

03:25:54.938 --> 03:25:58.117
SAM: I think they're on the road to recovery.

03:25:58.117 --> 03:26:00.474
TALIESIN: Something very positive's going to come
out of that relationship.

03:26:00.474 --> 03:26:01.402
SAM: Yes.

03:26:01.402 --> 03:26:02.765
LIAM: Yasha!

03:26:02.765 --> 03:26:04.028
ASHLEY: Yeah?

03:26:04.028 --> 03:26:10.318
LIAM: What is on your mind? You're very quiet.
You're not thinking about leaving us again, are you?

03:26:10.318 --> 03:26:14.337
ASHLEY: Why would you think that?

03:26:14.337 --> 03:26:23.406
LIAM: Well, you tend to go mum for a while, and
then you're gone. You’re very useful for us! We

03:26:23.406 --> 03:26:32.866
could do great things together, the not-nine of
us. I hope you're not thinking of leaving.

03:26:32.866 --> 03:26:47.764
ASHLEY: Well, I'm not at this moment. I think--
and if I did, I would find my way back to you.

03:26:47.764 --> 03:26:52.847
Sometimes things need to be done.

03:26:52.847 --> 03:27:01.791
LIAM: Well, no one's going to bully you into a
decision, but we're all happy to have you here.

03:27:01.791 --> 03:27:09.510
You know, my muscles are big. They can accomplish
a lot, but we do better with you around.

03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:21.534
ASHLEY: Thank you, Caleb. I think you can manage
just fine, but I will-- I'm here for now.

03:27:21.534 --> 03:27:25.854
SAM: She's not going anywhere! What are you,
crazy, Caleb? She's fine! Come on!

03:27:25.854 --> 03:27:27.201
LIAM: It was just a feeling I had.

03:27:27.201 --> 03:27:28.469
SAM: You're crazy!

03:27:28.469 --> 03:27:29.564
LIAM: I understand.

03:27:29.564 --> 03:27:30.372
SAM: It's fine!

03:27:30.372 --> 03:27:32.495
ASHLEY: What a strange feeling.

03:27:32.495 --> 03:27:34.424
MARISHA: What time is it?

03:27:34.424 --> 03:27:39.590
MATT: At this point-- well, no, you slept through
the night and you've woken up the next morning, so

03:27:39.590 --> 03:27:41.591
it's pushing close to midday.

03:27:41.591 --> 03:27:43.689
TALIESIN: Let's get on our way soon.

03:27:43.689 --> 03:27:46.590
MARISHA: Yeah. To Shitty Creek?

03:27:46.590 --> 03:27:48.211
TALIESIN: Let's make our way.

03:27:48.211 --> 03:27:49.862
SAM: Is that where we're going next?

03:27:49.862 --> 03:27:54.849
MATT: Fjord musters the cart, the horses,
retrieves them from where they were stored during

03:27:54.849 --> 03:27:56.135
your stay here.

03:27:56.135 --> 03:27:58.614
SAM: Are we making our way out of town?

03:27:58.614 --> 03:28:01.287
MATT: Looks like it, unless you guys have anything
else planned.

03:28:01.287 --> 03:28:04.579
SAM: On the way out of town-- you said when we
came into town there were some guards with

03:28:04.579 --> 03:28:07.660
pistols, with guns?

03:28:07.660 --> 03:28:08.589
MATT: Yes.

03:28:08.589 --> 03:28:10.404
SAM: Do we see any on the way out?

03:28:10.404 --> 03:28:15.369
MATT: Make a perception check, as you make your
way through the bottom end of the city.

03:28:15.369 --> 03:28:16.448
SAM: 14.

03:28:16.448 --> 03:28:23.093
MATT: 14? Glancing through, there are two
crownsguard that walk by, both gnomish. One of

03:28:23.093 --> 03:28:31.697
them appears to be carrying a heavy sword on the
back. The other one does have some sort of strange

03:28:31.697 --> 03:28:36.326
contraption, like a firearm pistol at its side.

03:28:36.326 --> 03:28:37.898
SAM: I'm going to try to steal it.

03:28:37.898 --> 03:28:39.157
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

03:28:39.157 --> 03:28:40.896
MARISHA: Yes!

03:28:40.896 --> 03:28:44.405
SAM: With either Mage Hand, or my own hand,
whatever's--

03:28:44.405 --> 03:28:45.109
MATT: Up to you.

03:28:45.109 --> 03:28:48.159
SAM: Mage Hand.

03:28:48.159 --> 03:28:49.665
MATT: All right.

03:28:49.665 --> 03:28:52.590
SAM: What am I doing? Sleight of hand?

03:28:52.590 --> 03:28:55.182
MATT: Sleight of hand, so your proficiency
modifier plus your dex.

03:28:55.182 --> 03:29:02.231
SAM: Oh. 19, then. So not sleight of hand, this is
a dexterity check.

03:29:02.231 --> 03:29:05.222
MATT: Well no, sleight of hand is-- I'm sorry, no,
it's a sleight of hand check.

03:29:05.222 --> 03:29:06.646
SAM: Oh, well then it's 22.

03:29:06.646 --> 03:29:14.353
MATT: 22, yeah. My brain. I was thinking of
unlocking. It glides past over you. The guard’s

03:29:14.353 --> 03:29:15.743
none the wiser.

03:29:15.743 --> 03:29:16.929
SAM: Okay.

03:29:16.929 --> 03:29:19.398
MATT: It is loaded with a single shot.

03:29:19.398 --> 03:29:20.592
SAM: Great.

03:29:20.592 --> 03:29:23.385
MATT: So you have a single-shot pistol with no
ammunition.

03:29:23.385 --> 03:29:26.592
SAM: It's loaded with a bullet, though, right?

03:29:26.592 --> 03:29:27.319
MATT: Yes.

03:29:27.319 --> 03:29:29.060
SAM: Okay, cool. Great. That's all I care about.

03:29:29.060 --> 03:29:30.168
MATT: All right. With that--

03:29:30.168 --> 03:29:35.935
MARISHA: If you're deserted on an island, to kill
yourself with?

03:29:35.935 --> 03:29:47.098
MATT: In those final dark moments! This campaign
goes really dark suddenly! With that, you guys

03:29:47.098 --> 03:29:57.125
head out past the fences, the artillery
construction ranges, the plumes of smoke and

03:29:57.125 --> 03:30:05.142
steam, the dual-shelved levels of the gnomish city
of Hupperdook, with the people, adventures that

03:30:05.142 --> 03:30:13.013
you met and left behind, and forge your way on
further up the Crispvale Roadway heading towards

03:30:13.013 --> 03:30:21.049
the Glory Run Road, that heads north, towards
Nogvurot and the Shadycreek Run. Heading on for

03:30:21.049 --> 03:30:28.669
the next better half of the day, you make a fair
amount of travel, before the sun eventually sets

03:30:28.669 --> 03:30:34.183
before you can reach the crossroads. Eventually
having to pull off to the side of the road to make

03:30:34.183 --> 03:30:39.807
camp for the first night there. You head off your
general curious range there, you set up a small

03:30:39.807 --> 03:30:42.440
camp. Who's taking first watch?

03:30:42.440 --> 03:30:43.628
LIAM: Nott and I.

03:30:43.628 --> 03:30:48.767
MATT: Okay. Nott and Caleb, if you wouldn't mind
rolling a perception check with advantage, or both

03:30:48.767 --> 03:30:50.588
of you roll it individually.

03:30:50.588 --> 03:30:51.671
SAM: You go.

03:30:51.671 --> 03:30:53.598
LIAM: With advantage?

03:30:53.598 --> 03:30:55.496
MATT: No, he rolled, and now you.

03:30:55.496 --> 03:30:56.862
SAM: I got a nine.

03:30:56.862 --> 03:31:02.622
LIAM: You got-- okay. Here comes. Oh, big eight.

03:31:02.622 --> 03:31:11.682
MATT: All right. You guys take your first watch.
Nothing. Though you're not paying much attention,

03:31:11.682 --> 03:31:16.800
nothing seems to transpire during that first watch
period. You finish it without issue. The second

03:31:16.800 --> 03:31:20.289
watch come up. Fjord goes ahead and says, "I'll
take it."

03:31:20.289 --> 03:31:22.248
ASHLEY: I'll join you.

03:31:22.248 --> 03:31:23.442
MATT: "You'll join as well, Yasha?"

03:31:23.442 --> 03:31:23.980
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:31:23.980 --> 03:31:32.257
MATT: All right. You guys take your second watch.
Fjord and Yasha are currently situated there. Two

03:31:32.257 --> 03:31:40.406
of you are up. It's now pushing past maybe one or
two in the morning. The fire is burned low to

03:31:40.406 --> 03:31:47.088
embers at this point, and you're both staying
close for heat. Fjord's sitting there looking, and

03:31:47.088 --> 03:31:56.394
goes, "I'm kind of proud of all this, you know?"

03:31:56.394 --> 03:32:10.218
ASHLEY: I am, too. I'm actually very surprised at
the choices we've made. Especially the choices

03:32:10.218 --> 03:32:13.125
that I've made.

03:32:13.125 --> 03:32:20.365
MATT: "Yeah. A lot of these folks have surprised
me." A little voice goes like, (as Jester) "Some

03:32:20.365 --> 03:32:25.036
"people are trying to sleep."

03:32:25.036 --> 03:32:26.866
ASHLEY: Sorry, Jester.

03:32:26.866 --> 03:32:37.717
MATT: "But I’m awake now." Fjord goes like, "Let’s
take a walk." Fjord stands up, Jester stands up,

03:32:37.717 --> 03:32:50.959
and the three of you step away for a minute. Fjord
looks up at the stars and goes, "Dreams’ve been

03:32:50.959 --> 03:33:04.746
"weird. For all the visions, the darkness out
there, it’s good to know that, somehow maybe we're

03:33:04.746 --> 03:33:08.583
"all putting a little bit of light in there too."

03:33:08.583 --> 03:33:13.026
ASHLEY: That’s a very nice way to put it.

03:33:13.026 --> 03:33:24.588
MATT: "Who knows? Maybe we’ll find ourselves a
path somewhere along the coast in the long run.

03:33:24.588 --> 03:33:33.525
"Could show you some of my hometown. Maybe some of
yours, but maybe not quite as well put together."

03:33:33.525 --> 03:33:41.931
Jester interjects at this point and goes, "Well,
if we do go back, I could show you-- if it is safe

03:33:41.931 --> 03:33:50.285
"depending on what my mom says-- the places where I
grew up, the beautiful shorelines. Have you been

03:33:50.285 --> 03:33:52.973
"to the Menagerie Coast before?"

03:33:52.973 --> 03:33:54.439
ASHLEY: "I’ve never been to the Coast."

03:33:54.439 --> 03:33:57.138
MATT: "Oh, it is so beautiful. It would be
incredible."

03:33:57.138 --> 03:34:00.631
ASHLEY: I’ve seen--

03:34:00.631 --> 03:34:14.477
MATT: Her mouth isn’t making noise. You go to
talk. No sound comes out of it either. There’s a

03:34:14.477 --> 03:34:23.762
look of confusion amongst the three of you. I need
you to make a wisdom saving throw, Yasha.

03:34:38.845 --> 03:34:41.091
What did you roll?

03:34:41.091 --> 03:34:45.358
ASHLEY: I rolled 11.

03:34:45.358 --> 03:34:50.587
MATT: In that moment of panic, you go to reach for
your weapon, and suddenly your muscles seize up

03:34:50.587 --> 03:34:56.769
and your body is unable to move. Your eyes glance
back at Fjord, who seems to be in the same

03:34:56.769 --> 03:35:02.186
position. The falchion apparates in his hand, but
he is unable to move. Jester is the only one who

03:35:02.186 --> 03:35:09.021
is like-- As she turns to run for the group, and
impacts the chest of a dark humanoid figure who’s

03:35:09.021 --> 03:35:14.128
standing there who grabs and holds her in place.
Four other dark figures emerge from the shadows

03:35:14.128 --> 03:35:19.555
around and grab and immediately put their arms
around you. You try and resist from the spell. In

03:35:19.555 --> 03:35:21.291
fact, make another wisdom saving throw.

03:35:21.291 --> 03:35:22.657
SAM: Oh god.

03:35:23.867 --> 03:35:24.898
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

03:35:24.898 --> 03:35:26.684
SAM: Whoa!

03:35:26.684 --> 03:35:32.247
MATT: Fjord maintains it, but all this in absolute
silence. There is no sound, just shadows and

03:35:32.247 --> 03:35:40.321
starlight. As you’re now being grappled by two
men, the spell breaks from you. However, they’re

03:35:40.321 --> 03:35:45.160
still holding you. As you feel a gag pulled over
your mouth from one of them, the other one begins

03:35:45.160 --> 03:35:49.497
to throw rope around you. You’re looking over the
side and you can see another gag showed into

03:35:49.497 --> 03:35:55.826
Fjord’s mouth. Manacles are being shoved onto his
arms and legs. He's unable to move. Jester tries

03:35:55.826 --> 03:36:01.058
to break free off the opposite-- not with a
natural seven. She’s kicking and screaming, but

03:36:01.058 --> 03:36:04.858
there is no sound coming out and as she’s pushed
down, another figure comes up and throws shackles

03:36:04.858 --> 03:36:09.754
onto her arms behind her and her legs. She’s
yelling and yelling and a gag is pulled over her

03:36:09.754 --> 03:36:11.925
mouth. What are you doing?

03:36:11.925 --> 03:36:13.402
ASHLEY: Am I--?

03:36:13.402 --> 03:36:15.765
MATT: There’s two people that are now coming to
grapple you.

03:36:15.765 --> 03:36:17.682
ASHLEY: I take out my weapon and I’m ready to go.

03:36:17.682 --> 03:36:20.855
MATT: All right. You pull your weapon. Make an
attack, if you want.

03:36:20.855 --> 03:36:26.802
ASHLEY: Yes. Okay. 25.

03:36:26.802 --> 03:36:29.468
MATT: 25 hits. Roll damage on that.

03:36:29.468 --> 03:36:36.285
TALIESIN: Where was this?

03:36:36.285 --> 03:36:40.336
SAM: She’s a bad motherfucker.

03:36:40.336 --> 03:36:46.195
ASHLEY: 18?

03:36:46.195 --> 03:36:51.824
MATT: 18 damage. Oof! You have a second attack, if
you like.

03:36:53.321 --> 03:36:56.028
ASHLEY: Oh, that’s a nine.

03:36:56.028 --> 03:37:01.199
MATT: Your first one impacts one guy and there’s a
splash of blood, silent. Once again, no sound

03:37:01.199 --> 03:37:05.492
here. The second one swings wide and the other guy
captures it. He grabs your arm and pulls you in.

03:37:05.492 --> 03:37:10.647
He’s going to make an athletics check against you.
Make an athletics or acrobatics check to try and

03:37:10.647 --> 03:37:13.847
not be grappled.

03:37:15.585 --> 03:37:17.765
ASHLEY: 13?

03:37:17.765 --> 03:37:21.648
MATT: That’s not going to make it. He grapples and
holds you in place. The other one takes and slams

03:37:21.648 --> 03:37:26.718
manacles onto your wrists and pulls it back,
wrenching the blade from your grasp. Your arms are

03:37:26.718 --> 03:37:29.287
now locked behind you into these metal manacles.

03:37:29.287 --> 03:37:36.034
ASHLEY: Can I try to scream out in some way to the
Stormlord?

03:37:36.034 --> 03:37:40.899
MATT: You go ahead and scream. Make a straight
wisdom check.

03:37:44.205 --> 03:37:46.169
ASHLEY: Three.

03:37:46.169 --> 03:37:50.482
MATT: In that moment, as you try and scream out,
your vocal cords strained by the sheer force of

03:37:50.482 --> 03:37:56.562
your voice, no sound comes out. Looking up in the
sky, there isn’t a single cloud in sight. Probably

03:37:56.562 --> 03:38:02.692
for the first time in weeks, since you’ve been in
this side of Wildemount, it is a clear night. No

03:38:02.692 --> 03:38:08.695
sign of clouds. No sign of storm. In that moment,
as you’re screaming out, the gag gets put into

03:38:08.695 --> 03:38:15.749
your mouth and tied behind your head. You glance
over and you can see Jester being dragged. Now the

03:38:15.749 --> 03:38:20.000
manacles affixed to the back of her ankles and
she’s being pulled through the grass, Fjord a few

03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:23.084
feet behind her. Still unable to really make out
the shapes of these hooded figures that are

03:38:23.084 --> 03:38:26.314
pulling them through and you are shoved to the
ground.

03:38:26.314 --> 03:38:27.400
ASHLEY: Are my legs still free?

03:38:27.400 --> 03:38:28.765
MATT: Your ankles are about to be manacled.

03:38:28.765 --> 03:38:29.839
ASHLEY: Can I kick?

03:38:29.839 --> 03:38:31.617
MATT: Make another athletics check.

03:38:34.523 --> 03:38:35.833
ASHLEY: 25.

03:38:35.833 --> 03:38:43.568
MATT: 25, all righty. With that, you manage to
kick free and they can’t quite get ahold on it and

03:38:43.568 --> 03:38:50.535
one figure steps forward, shorter than the others,
stout looking, and goes, "Oh for the--" and his

03:38:50.535 --> 03:38:57.965
voice dissipates as he gets closer. I need you to
make another wisdom saving throw.

03:39:01.185 --> 03:39:02.568
ASHLEY: 17.

03:39:02.568 --> 03:39:07.921
MATT: You’re still kicking and breaking free.
They’re going to try to restrain you once more.

03:39:07.921 --> 03:39:10.687
Roll one more athletics check.

03:39:13.319 --> 03:39:15.350
ASHLEY: Eight.

03:39:15.350 --> 03:39:19.407
MATT: No, that’s not going to do it. As much as
you struggle right now, you’re by yourself. Now it

03:39:19.407 --> 03:39:24.463
looks like two figures holding you down, and the
third one that is frustrated that you have

03:39:24.463 --> 03:39:29.958
resisted a spell a second time. They get the
manacles on the back of your legs. Your arms are

03:39:29.958 --> 03:39:34.248
held behind, your ankles are now pulled up towards
where your hands are, and you are face down in the

03:39:34.248 --> 03:39:40.568
wet grass in the middle of the night, as you feel
your body now being dragged by the chains.

03:39:40.568 --> 03:39:48.764
Dragged, dragged. Your mouth is filled with the
taste of the sweat that’s poured down, that’s

03:39:48.764 --> 03:39:53.713
soaked into the gag that's now forced in your
mouth. Grass and grime and mud are grinding

03:39:53.713 --> 03:39:59.593
against your face. All you can see is the dark
shadow there and the bits of star and sky ahead,

03:39:59.593 --> 03:40:16.037
until eventually you’re lifted upright, right back
once more. Immediately, you can see a series of

03:40:16.037 --> 03:40:24.167
wide carts, large travel caravan carts that are
low set, covered with piles of goods. Looks like

03:40:24.167 --> 03:40:30.972
sacks and a couple of crates, fairly
sparse-looking for travel caravan crates, but what

03:40:30.972 --> 03:40:35.398
you see travel up and down the roads all the time.
There are three of them with horses to the front

03:40:35.398 --> 03:40:42.419
of them. You can see about eight other figures
around these carts. As you’re up held there, with

03:40:42.419 --> 03:40:47.421
your mouth gagged and your arms and legs bound,
you look off to the side and you can see Fjord and

03:40:47.421 --> 03:40:53.868
Jester also struggling and unable to find their
way about. Jester begins to flex against it and

03:40:53.868 --> 03:40:59.858
you can see her strong physique pushing against
it, and she gets smacked upside the cheek by one

03:40:59.858 --> 03:41:08.914
of the men that pulls her and holds her in place.
You hear a voice speak up and say, "Hey, look what

03:41:08.914 --> 03:41:18.209
"we found, eh?" You see a dark figure step closer
to you. Glancing up, through the minimal light, a

03:41:18.209 --> 03:41:24.531
human man, tall and brutish. His head is
completely bald on top, revealing a scarred and

03:41:24.531 --> 03:41:31.966
tattooed design across one side that curls down
into his lightly leathered armored chest. His

03:41:31.966 --> 03:41:39.861
thick brow hangs over two cold, uncaring eyes. He
nods in approval to these three acquisitions that

03:41:39.861 --> 03:41:45.811
you are, revealing a number of golden teeth
between his cracked lips. His muscular body is

03:41:45.811 --> 03:41:53.324
mostly obscured by a cloak and hood beyond that
armor. The thug goes, "Lorenzo, your instincts are

03:41:53.324 --> 03:42:00.348
"sharp. Looks like we found ourselves a sudden
bounty." The heavy figure, who hasn’t spoken at

03:42:00.348 --> 03:42:06.678
this point, kneels down and grabs the chins of
each of you. Grabs Jester, who is now shaking,

03:42:06.678 --> 03:42:13.748
with anger and fear in her eyes, looks both sides
of her face, goes to Fjord and lifts the chin,

03:42:13.748 --> 03:42:15.024
comes to you and grabs--

03:42:15.024 --> 03:42:16.203
ASHLEY: I spit in his face.

03:42:16.203 --> 03:42:24.616
MATT: The gag is right there, so you-- (coughing)
"Looks like this one’s got some spirit too.

03:42:24.616 --> 03:42:38.678
"(chuckles) Our prospects are good with this find.
Two divine-blood and one half-beast. I’m pleased.

03:42:38.678 --> 03:42:46.218
"Toss them in with the others. We’ll head back. Our
cages are at capacity now." He stands back up and

03:42:46.218 --> 03:42:50.655
turns around and heads back to the carts, as
you’re all being thrown to your sides again and

03:42:50.655 --> 03:42:56.356
being dragged through the wet grass and dirt, over
rocks. You can feel gashes being pulled across

03:42:56.356 --> 03:43:01.376
your face and shoulders as you’re being pulled
through the dirt. You’re righted once more and two

03:43:01.376 --> 03:43:07.210
more goons lift you up towards the back of this
mostly empty cart. It seems just small piles and

03:43:07.210 --> 03:43:12.659
boxes, and then suddenly your vision shifts, as if
you’re being pulled through a curtain and these

03:43:12.659 --> 03:43:22.957
carts are piled high with cages. And the opened
one that the three of you are showed into clangs

03:43:22.957 --> 03:43:28.658
behind you, this five feet by five feet box. As
the three of you are jammed into each other

03:43:28.658 --> 03:43:37.497
uncomfortably, you look about inside, under what
looks to be a darkened tarp that covers the cages.

03:43:37.497 --> 03:43:40.490
Glancing out the side of your eye, you can see in
the one next to you, that there are other dark

03:43:40.490 --> 03:43:49.716
humanoid figures quietly whimpering and not
moving. You hear "Heyup!" and the horses begin to

03:43:49.716 --> 03:43:56.876
pick up speed, as the creaking of wheels turning
get faster and the feel of the cart beginning to

03:43:56.876 --> 03:44:01.158
move. And that’s where we’re going to finish
tonight’s session.

03:44:01.158 --> 03:44:05.093
(groaning)

03:44:05.093 --> 03:44:11.408
SAM: Was she taken and Fjord and Jester?

03:44:11.408 --> 03:44:12.868
TALIESIN: The three of them, yep.

03:44:12.868 --> 03:44:13.615
SAM: All in the same cart.

03:44:13.615 --> 03:44:14.708
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:44:14.708 --> 03:44:16.709
ASHLEY: Fuck.

03:44:16.709 --> 03:44:19.495
MARISHA: My heart.

03:44:19.495 --> 03:44:22.506
SAM: We heard it with our passive perception.

03:44:22.506 --> 03:44:26.183
MARISHA: They were in a Silence spell.

03:44:26.183 --> 03:44:30.458
SAM: Oh, I forgot to tell you that I never went to
sleep and I was watching the whole time!

03:44:34.432 --> 03:44:39.437
MARISHA: Better be some dope investigating at the
top when we come back.

03:44:39.437 --> 03:44:42.036
TALIESIN: Maybe you hit him enough so that you
left a clue.

03:44:42.036 --> 03:44:43.131
MATT: It’s possible.

03:44:43.131 --> 03:44:44.093
SAM: Well yeah, blood.

03:44:44.093 --> 03:44:46.006
MATT: There were some struggle.

03:44:46.006 --> 03:44:49.807
MARISHA: Blood! Splatter! Some CSI shit! Up in
here!

03:44:49.807 --> 03:44:51.585
SAM: Yeah, we’ll get a black light.

03:44:51.585 --> 03:44:52.841
(laughter)

03:44:52.841 --> 03:44:54.700
SAM: We’re going to name it Caruso.

03:44:54.700 --> 03:44:56.565
MARISHA: Yeah, we’ll have dope one-liners.

03:44:56.565 --> 03:44:57.068
ASHLEY: Yup.

03:44:57.068 --> 03:44:59.130
MARISHA: The Who. It’s going to be great.

03:44:59.130 --> 03:45:02.848
LIAM: Oh man, what a foursome. Holy shit.

03:45:03.918 --> 03:45:05.863
MATT: It’s going to be interesting.

03:45:09.973 --> 03:45:12.460
ASHLEY: This was too much! Kiri and then this?

03:45:15.440 --> 03:45:16.781
LIAM: We did the right thing with Kiri.

03:45:16.781 --> 03:45:17.626
ASHLEY: My heart.

03:45:17.626 --> 03:45:18.177
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:45:19.687 --> 03:45:20.563
MATT: Love you guys.

03:45:20.563 --> 03:45:27.585
MARISHA: We didn’t kill Fjord and Jester, though!
By puppeting them. We took some money, but that’s

03:45:27.585 --> 03:45:30.208
a good cost for not killing them.

03:45:32.498 --> 03:45:35.379
LIAM: We did drain Laura’s coffers, though.

03:45:35.379 --> 03:45:36.624
ASHLEY: Just a little.

03:45:36.624 --> 03:45:37.816
LIAM: There was that.

03:45:37.816 --> 03:45:40.897
TALIESIN: To be fair, it’s not like the money
would do her any good right now.

03:45:42.227 --> 03:45:43.178
MARISHA: That 75 gold?

03:45:43.178 --> 03:45:46.795
TALIESIN: They’re going to take all of that, so if
anything--

03:45:47.285 --> 03:45:51.030
MATT: Well, she didn’t take her haversack with her
when she parted with you guys.

03:45:51.030 --> 03:45:54.369
MARISHA: So we have the haversack. And if they get
disarmed--

03:45:54.369 --> 03:45:55.902
TALIESIN: Really, it’s our money now.

03:45:55.902 --> 03:45:56.593
SAM: Mm-hmm.

03:45:56.593 --> 03:45:57.760
MATT: You can take that up with Laura.

03:45:58.490 --> 03:46:02.144
TALIESIN: I’m going to have access to this
haversack for a while, I’m just saying. Sorry.

03:46:02.144 --> 03:46:03.032
MATT: Oh boy.

03:46:03.032 --> 03:46:04.929
TALIESIN: Oh boy. I’m going to get in trouble.

03:46:04.929 --> 03:46:06.344
MATT: Love you, Ashley.

03:46:06.344 --> 03:46:06.960
ASHLEY: Love you.

03:46:06.960 --> 03:46:08.137
TALIESIN: Oh god! No!

03:46:08.137 --> 03:46:10.727
MATT: She goes back to New York. You’ll hop in
when you can.

03:46:10.727 --> 03:46:12.299
ASHLEY: I’ll hop in when I can.

03:46:12.299 --> 03:46:13.710
LIAM: No, she doesn’t! Is that true?

03:46:13.710 --> 03:46:14.127
ASHLEY: What?

03:46:14.127 --> 03:46:15.813
LIAM: You’re leaving?

03:46:15.813 --> 03:46:16.320
ASHLEY: Yep.

03:46:18.010 --> 03:46:18.823
MATT: He knows that.

03:46:18.823 --> 03:46:20.476
LIAM: Don’t go.

03:46:20.476 --> 03:46:21.511
MATT: I know.

03:46:21.511 --> 03:46:26.445
LIAM: Stay here! And play D&amp;amp;D for weeks and years
at the old folks’ home.

03:46:26.445 --> 03:46:27.770
MATT and ASHLEY: I know.

03:46:27.770 --> 03:46:29.710
MARISHA: We’re just selfish.

03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:31.294
LIAM: Yeah, we are.

03:46:31.294 --> 03:46:33.496
ASHLEY: But Skyping isn’t the same, yeah?

03:46:34.536 --> 03:46:38.634
LIAM: No, I feel like I’m in a bunker underneath
the ocean.

03:46:38.634 --> 03:46:39.444
MATT: I know.

03:46:39.444 --> 03:46:40.648
MARISHA: You sound like it.

03:46:40.648 --> 03:46:44.074
LIAM: There’s just a half a second of delay and
that’s all it takes to make feel like I’m 80 feet away.

03:46:44.074 --> 03:46:48.082
TALIESIN: No, it’s like playing D&amp;amp;D with General
Zod. I mean I’m happy to do it, but it is a little weird.

03:46:48.082 --> 03:46:50.493
(laughter)

03:46:50.493 --> 03:46:51.578
TALIESIN: It’s a little much.

03:46:52.308 --> 03:46:53.863
LIAM: Can I be Terence Stamp?

03:46:55.503 --> 03:46:56.347
MATT: It’s true.

03:46:56.347 --> 03:46:57.494
TALIESIN: Bless you.

03:46:57.494 --> 03:46:59.518
MATT: Thank you, Liam, for making it.

03:46:59.518 --> 03:47:01.885
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Thank you, Liam!

03:47:01.885 --> 03:47:06.339
SAM: Thank you, Matt for making this game work
with half of a crew.

03:47:06.339 --> 03:47:09.963
LIAM: --Baryshnikov of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

03:47:11.053 --> 03:47:14.037
MARISHA: Congrats to Laura and Travis!

03:47:15.277 --> 03:47:19.287
SAM: I’m sure they’re sound asleep right now. Just
getting a good night’s sleep.

03:47:19.287 --> 03:47:23.294
(laughter)

03:47:23.294 --> 03:47:25.854
MATT: Oh yeah, the dads get to laugh now.

03:47:25.854 --> 03:47:26.848
TALIESIN: Never again.

03:47:26.848 --> 03:47:28.351
SAM: The first night is rough!

03:47:28.351 --> 03:47:32.799
LIAM: Just you wait, Travis Willingham! The
chickens are all coming home to roost!

03:47:34.769 --> 03:47:37.307
TALIESIN: This is the most complicated revenge
plan I've ever heard.

03:47:37.307 --> 03:47:41.341
MARISHA; I know! These fucking assholes are like,
"One of us! When are you going to join our

03:47:41.341 --> 03:47:43.395
"misery?!" And I'm like, "No!"

03:47:43.395 --> 03:47:44.670
MATT: We're good!

03:47:44.670 --> 03:47:46.495
LIAM: Not misery.

03:47:46.495 --> 03:47:48.270
TALIESIN: Sleep is all gone.

03:47:48.270 --> 03:47:53.362
MARISHA: No, it's not misery. It's beautiful and
amazing and incredible.

03:47:53.362 --> 03:47:57.931
MATT: All right, we're going to go so I can go to
sleep because it's been a very long day.

03:47:57.931 --> 03:47:59.820
TALIESIN; It's been a very long day!

03:47:59.820 --> 03:48:01.482
MARISHA: The day's not over!

03:48:01.482 --> 03:48:02.025
ASHLEY: No!

03:48:02.025 --> 03:48:04.034
MARISHA: For me, at least!

03:48:04.034 --> 03:48:05.996
MATT: I know. That's okay.

03:48:05.996 --> 03:48:06.697
MARISHA: Let's move.

03:48:06.697 --> 03:48:13.181
MATT: Okay. Well guys, we're off next week. We'll
miss you then. We'll leave you on this fantastic

03:48:13.181 --> 03:48:19.189
cliffhanger for the next two weeks and we'll pick
up from there with a guest or two which we'll

03:48:19.189 --> 03:48:27.829
announce as we finalize the schedule. Yeah! It
means we have two guests and one guest may have

03:48:27.829 --> 03:48:32.192
on-camera work that is waiting to hear if they can
make that first session, so we'll find out.

03:48:32.192 --> 03:48:38.081
(singing) The life of the actor! But yes, we'll
have announcements soon on that. In the meantime,

03:48:38.081 --> 03:48:43.699
guys, thank you so much for coming with us. We
love you, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!

03:48:43.699 --> 04:00:09.104

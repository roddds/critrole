00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.110
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.360
Critical Role where a bunch of us

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.560
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and

4
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.676
play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:09.620
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.470
MATT: What even--? Okay.

7
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.830
First off, we have our wonderful

8
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.663
Ashley Johnson back!

9
00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:15.764
ASHLEY: Hi!

10
00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:19.195
LIAM, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: Yay!

11
00:00:19.195 --> 00:00:20.670
MARISHA: Woo-hoo!

12
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.907
ASHLEY: It's a wild Ashley at the table.

13
00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:25.464
LAURA: We are complete.
TRAVIS: She appears.

14
00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:26.297
ASHLEY: Hello!

15
00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:27.130
MATT: Welcome back.

16
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.910
ASHLEY: Thank you.

17
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.950
MATT: That's our first announcement.

18
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.990
Second announcement, our fantastic sponsors

19
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.230
and our friends since the beginning of this campaign.

20
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.580
D&amp;D Beyond have returned this week.

21
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.440
Sam if you want a few words.

22
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.340
SAM: I don't have much to say. D&amp;D Beyond. As many of you

23
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.700
know, I am running for the president of D&amp;D Beyond

24
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.520
and the campaign continues.

25
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.530
I think my campaign has been run great.

26
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.670
I have a lot of attention and support

27
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.730
from regular Americans and people all around the world

28
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.500
and even better than regular people,

29
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.550
celebrities have also endorsed me as we saw.

30
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.830
But I'm required by law to give equal time

31
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.910
to my opponent. So tonight I'm going to turn it over

32
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.360
to Liam O'Brien to see what he wants to talk about.

33
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.193
LIAM: Thank you, Sam.

34
00:01:10.193 --> 00:01:11.349
LAURA: Woo!

35
00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:12.290
TRAVIS: Boo!

36
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.698
LIAM: Matt, if I may.

37
00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:17.089
I have a vitally important announcement

38
00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:19.760
this evening. Let's be frank: over

39
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.030
the last several weeks the political landscape

40
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.165
around D&amp;D Beyond has gotten a little clouded.

41
00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:30.660
In a race that should be about the issues plain and simple,

42
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.020
well again and again we see an election process

43
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.180
lost in haze, obscured by cheap gimmicks,

44
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.180
third party candidates, and an overall--

45
00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.678
do not say that name--

46
00:01:44.678 --> 00:01:46.420
and an overall lack of focus.

47
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.270
While my overwhelming lead in the polls should be

48
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.470
a comfort to us all--

49
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.861
SAM: Well, the polls can be wrong.

50
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.930
LIAM: Make no mistake.

51
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.320
Unlike some, I take this election eminently serious.

52
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.820
To that end, in an effort to shine a light

53
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.210
on corruption and illuminate any of you still in doubt

54
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.120
it does me and the Everlight herself my great honor

55
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.120
to formally announce-- (lip flapping) formally announce

56
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.690
my running mate on the road--

57
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.200
SAM: There's literally no one you can announce

58
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.570
that would have any chance of beating me, but go on.

59
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.940
LIAM: Come with me to D&amp;D and beyond,

60
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.206
Ashley Johnson.

61
00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:31.050
SAM: What?

62
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.425
LIAM: My running mate.

63
00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:34.633
LAURA and SAM: What?!

64
00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:35.750
TRAVIS: No.

65
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.875
LIAM: You all know where I stand.

66
00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:38.830
SAM: This is cheating.

67
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.500
LIAM: Ashley, welcome back. The table top is yours.

68
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.860
MARISHA: Speech!

69
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.885
SAM: She can't, she's not even.

70
00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:49.318
TALIESIN: Equal time.

71
00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:51.746
ASHLEY: Thank you, Mr. President.

72
00:02:53.538 --> 00:02:55.320
TRAVIS: It stings already!

73
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.000
ASHLEY: As a testament to Liam's character

74
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.660
and judge of thereof, he's chosen me

75
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.430
as his vice president in this campaign.

76
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.510
To say I'm honored would be an understatement

77
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.960
of my own achievements so I will just say: You're welcome.

78
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.630
As Liam's running mate it is only fitting

79
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.847
that I drop some running hate.

80
00:03:19.847 --> 00:03:21.896
SAM: What?

81
00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:24.747
ASHLEY: To the people of this great land,

82
00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:27.970
this man offers you not only himself,

83
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.920
but also myself and what is myself?

84
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.450
Well, I can tell you what myself is not

85
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.676
and myself is not an alcoholic.

86
00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:41.720
Friends, people, voters, we all watched this week's

87
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.740
Talks Machina where my running mate's opponent

88
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.370
came out in favor of alcoholism.

89
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.050
Alcoholism, what is this, 1956?

90
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.680
What do you go home and watch Mad Men at night

91
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.780
and pretend that's how the world still is?

92
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.650
Do you want a candidate with the lily white hands

93
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.090
of a man who has never worked a day in his life

94
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.090
or someone with hands so seasoned and robust

95
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.140
you both imagine them tucking you in at night

96
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.860
and strangling your enemies at the same time?

97
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.320
There are real issues on the table with this election.

98
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.920
Are the people supposed to rally behind a guy

99
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.785
who looks like a donkey wearing a Jeff Goldblum mask?

100
00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:29.360
(laughter)

101
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.050
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

102
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.570
ASHLEY: Or a tried and true man of the people

103
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.170
with a smile that doesn't make you

104
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.745
want to drown yourself in hot goat piss.

105
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.250
Oh and this third party candidate, Arsequeef,

106
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.570
just wants to sleep with my fiance and my running mate.

107
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.380
Right now, yes, we are ahead in the polls,

108
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.810
but we may not always have this delicious of a lead,

109
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.700
but let's be honest, polls are meant to be ridden.

110
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.240
Only one person and that person's recently announced

111
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.950
running mate can bring order and structure to the world

112
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.100
once more. Those two people that I'm talking about

113
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.786
are Liam and myself, just to be clear.

114
00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:18.320
So this year #VoteWithYourJohnson--

115
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.742
SAM: Oh shit. This is good!

116
00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:23.166
ASHLEY: And vote O'Brien for president.

117
00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:24.680
And that is all I have to say.

118
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.210
TRAVIS: That's-- wow.

119
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.547
LIAM: That's my vice president!

120
00:05:28.547 --> 00:05:32.580
TRAVIS: Wow! I have a compelling, convincing--

121
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.580
SAM: I feel my whole body hurts.

122
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.440
I feel like I've been trampled by some sort of livestock.

123
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.423
MARISHA: That roast of Sam Riegel will be on Comedy Central

124
00:05:44.423 --> 00:05:47.866
at about 1:00pm tonight.

125
00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:50.067
TRAVIS: Jeff Goldblum mask.

126
00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:52.760
LIAM: That is the best funeral dirge I ever heard.

127
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.550
MATT: Wow.

128
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.346
ASHLEY: You know, it's good to be back.

129
00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:01.830
TRAVIS: Oh, my head hurts, my head hurts

130
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.370
SAM: Thanks, D&amp;D Beyond.

131
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.312
Be sure to subscribe at dndbeyond.com.

132
00:06:12.737 --> 00:06:16.570
I think I'm going to throw up now. Back to you, Matt.

133
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.080
MATT: Thank you, Sam. That was distinctly less shark costume

134
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.820
this week and I think probably

135
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.710
we'll all agree a little better.

136
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.802
It's okay take your time, I felt the searing from here.

137
00:06:29.802 --> 00:06:32.070
So thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, of course.

138
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.490
Yesterday was the season finale of Pub Draw.

139
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.620
If you haven't had a chance to check it out

140
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.000
from our fantastic friend and instructor,

141
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.670
Babs Tarr's been helming this whole season.

142
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.430
We've been able to watch Marisha just

143
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.464
catapult her way through.

144
00:06:43.464 --> 00:06:44.863
MARISHA: No, catastrophic's a fine word.

145
00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.337
MATT: No, catapult is what I was going to say.

146
00:06:46.337 --> 00:06:47.495
LIAM: Catastrophically catapult her way through.

147
00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:48.330
MATT: Yes, exactly,

148
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.211
which is really on brand when you consider it.

149
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:54.310
(screams) Rag doll her way.

150
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.710
From a very awesome beginning to an incredible growth

151
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.550
of skill this entire time, which has been amazing.

152
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.240
You've all had a chance to see it.

153
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.880
They had me on it as well to knock off some of my rust.

154
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.310
We all drew Gilmore, which is really exciting, my boy.

155
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.840
TRAVIS: Matt, you can't draw for shit, man, and it's crazy.

156
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.013
LAURA: I know, it was really sad to see.

157
00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:12.180
TRAVIS: Like, total amateur hour, bro.

158
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.160
MATT: If you missed it, want to check it out,

159
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.770
the VOD is here on our Twitch or you can see it

160
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.070
tomorrow on our YouTube. So keep an eye out for that.

161
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.000
Also, as a reminder, many of our shows including

162
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.332
Talks Machina and Critical Role are available

163
00:07:27.332 --> 00:07:31.965
on podcast format-- talk for a living--

164
00:07:31.965 --> 00:07:33.330
on iTunes, Google and Spotify.

165
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.200
Look for the black Critical Role logo

166
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.770
after searching your favorite podcasting app.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.454
To check it out you can go to

169
00:07:43.868 --> 00:07:47.210
We also have one more week left of our Kickstarter.

170
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.990
TRAVIS: Yeah, seven days!

171
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.940
MATT: Seven days.

172
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.590
That's your favorite phrase, Travis.

173
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.060
TRAVIS: I just wanted to keep it on the Kickstarter,

174
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.060
can we not make it about The Ring?

175
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.514
MATT: (laughs)
TRAVIS: (groans)

176
00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:03.130
MATT: Yeah, on that note, speaking of which,

177
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.790
Sam set the secret stretch goal

178
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.390
that if we manage to hit 10 million by the end of this

179
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.130
we're going to put all in on filming Travis

180
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.670
going through the hauntedest of houses.

181
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.868
TALIESIN: You have no idea.

182
00:08:17.868 --> 00:08:19.435
LAURA: Do we get to go with him,

183
00:08:19.435 --> 00:08:20.749
or does he have to go by himself to the haunted--

184
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:23.182
SAM: There are no rules to this secret stretch goal

185
00:08:23.182 --> 00:08:24.515
because it was invented on the fly.

186
00:08:24.515 --> 00:08:25.698
TALIESIN: Can we talk to them

187
00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:27.780
about us working the haunted house while he's going through?

188
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.271
LIAM: I don't want to get punched in the face

189
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:30.455
through a rubber mask!

190
00:08:30.455 --> 00:08:31.740
TALIESIN: We go where it hurts.

191
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.739
LAURA: No, it's better if he doesn't know who's behind it.

192
00:08:33.739 --> 00:08:35.090
TRAVIS: I've never struck nor will ever strike

193
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.260
a haunted house worker. I am too busy screaming,

194
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.880
peeing myself, and hiding in the corner.

195
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.053
LIAM: Pure entertainment.

196
00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:44.620
TALIESIN: You have it coming, too. I'm so excited.

197
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.572
SAM: It's achievable, this goal is achievable.

198
00:08:46.572 --> 00:08:48.460
MATT: Whenever the world gets a little dark

199
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.250
and the weight on my shoulders in the morning

200
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.180
gets a bit heavy, I stop and close my eyes

201
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.290
and reminisce about the times on Halloween Horror Nights

202
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.400
that we let Travis go first.

203
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.660
It brightens my day immediately.

204
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.990
TRAVIS: We don't need to hit the lights.

205
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.180
LIAM: It's like you have Freddie Mercury with you

206
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.500
hitting the high notes.

207
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.754
MATT: It's so beautiful.

208
00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:08.610
SAM: Mariah Carey.

209
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.130
MATT: Anyway, looking forward to hopefully that

210
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.430
and no worries if not, but excited to see this

211
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.346
Kickstarter come to a close

212
00:09:17.346 --> 00:09:20.190
and for us to get cracking on this.

213
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.480
Thank you, everybody, who's put in their support

214
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.220
to help this become a reality, let alone

215
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.620
on the scale that it is.

216
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.600
This is incredible.

217
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.392
We're still blown away by it.

218
00:09:32.392 --> 00:09:34.540
If that wasn't crazy enough,

219
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.630
earlier today, we announced that our special campaign

220
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.820
end of stream party we're having next week

221
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.450
after the game that night is happening,

222
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.680
with a very special guest, Joel Hodgson,

223
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.690
from Mystery Science Theater 3000,

224
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.970
which is crazy. One, because one they were previously

225
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.980
the top film media Kickstarter and they've been

226
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.320
very supportive and as we waved

227
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.650
to them as we barely crossed that line passed.

228
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.820
So Joel's coming to support and be a part of this,

229
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.890
which is incredible. It's equally crazy

230
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.170
because I grew up watching him constantly,

231
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.320
so this is really surreal for a lot of us.

232
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.930
He'll be there as part of that party

233
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.630
after next week's show.

234
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.930
For more details, go to critrole.com

235
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.588
and to join our campaign critrole.com/animated.

236
00:10:17.588 --> 00:10:19.423
We have one merch update from you, Laura, I believe.

237
00:10:19.423 --> 00:10:21.490
LAURA: Yes, I just wanted to let you guys know

238
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.670
to keep your eye if you are wanting dice

239
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.050
and you haven't been able to get our blue

240
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.080
and Wildemount dice set, they should be

241
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.670
going back in stock tomorrow.

242
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.740
So woo! That's all. I just wanted to let you know.

243
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.050
SAM: What's on your head?

244
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.940
LAURA: Oh this, this old beanie?

245
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.004
This is our prototype that we just got in

246
00:10:41.004 --> 00:10:46.004
for our Kickstarter, one of our swags.

247
00:10:46.223 --> 00:10:47.380
ASHLEY: It just says Critical Role on the leather.

248
00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.706
LAURA: I know!

249
00:10:48.706 --> 00:10:50.047
SAM: The Legend of Vox Machina.

250
00:10:50.047 --> 00:10:51.480
TRAVIS: That's pretty legit, that's pretty hot.

251
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.480
LAURA: Yeah, so I wanted to wear it tonight. It's neat.

252
00:10:56.501 --> 00:10:59.015
TRAVIS, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Yeah!

253
00:10:59.015 --> 00:11:00.100
MATT: I believe that brings us to the end

254
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.050
of our announcements, so thank you for your patience.

255
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.170
On that note, let's go ahead and bring us in

256
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.151

284

MATT: Hello and welcome back.

285
00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:54.445
Last we left off, The Mighty Nein had discovered

286
00:12:55.487 --> 00:12:58.997
that an attack on Felderwin back in the Empire

287
00:12:58.997 --> 00:13:03.997
had ended with Yeza the husband of Nott from long before

288
00:13:05.844 --> 00:13:09.411
absconded and dragged all the way to Xhorhas

289
00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:12.739
to the city Ghor Dranas, the previous capital

290
00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:15.072
of the Betrayer Gods of the calamity

291
00:13:15.072 --> 00:13:18.060
and now the center of the Kryn Dynasty.

292
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.940
Traversing the dangers along the way,

293
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.710
you made your way across the wastes

294
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.550
under the actual crust of Exandria through

295
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.980
into the City of Beasts, doing deeds and making allies,

296
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.030
eventually gaining a chance to have a conversation

297
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.790
and gain some favor with the Bright Queen herself,

298
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.730
the center of the Dynasty.

299
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.620
Upon which, after a bit of a tussle

300
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.730
and a mode of tension, you bequeathed

301
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.780
onto her and thus the Dynasty the dodecahedron,

302
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.930
the beacon of which you carried for oh so long,

303
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.940
which seemingly is an extremely important

304
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.185
religious relic within the society.

305
00:13:54.185 --> 00:13:57.530
In doing so, you gained quite a bit of favor

306
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.390
with this side of the war.

307
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.180
You were given the freedom of Yeza

308
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.720
and a few medallions to show your status

309
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.930
as a friend to the Bright Queen

310
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.590
as you are now traveling essentially

311
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.670
in enemy lands from where you began

312
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.590
and may run into a few situations

313
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.590
where others may not be as excited about your presence.

314
00:14:20.243 --> 00:14:22.940
You were given a couple of leads

315
00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.270
for possible work or ways to continue

316
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.560
your positive climb within the Dynasty.

317
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.380
You were given a place to stay within the Dim's Inn

318
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.140
in the Gallimaufry district of the city.

319
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.602
You all, after getting some rooms and

320
00:14:41.602 --> 00:14:43.893
making some plans for the following day,

321
00:14:43.893 --> 00:14:47.118
took a night's rest.

322
00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:51.210
You all gradually wake up

323
00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:56.210
the following morning, well-rested.

324
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.686
Strange to you all that upon looking out

325
00:14:59.686 --> 00:15:03.070
the windows, the sky is still dark

326
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:08.070
though you still are fairly certain

327
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.310
that it should be mid-morning.

328
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.205
You've both already gone downstairs,

329
00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:17.690
as we left on last session, had your breakfast conversation

330
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.705
and friendship bro hug.

331
00:15:21.705 --> 00:15:26.705
The rest of you, what would you like to do?

332
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.046
TALIESIN: Ah.

333
00:15:30.046 --> 00:15:31.740
LAURA: (sniffs)

334
00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.406
SAM: I'm sleeping in.

335
00:15:33.406 --> 00:15:36.010
TALIESIN: We're all sleeping in.

336
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.560
MATT: All right, well that was a good game, guys.

337
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.470
SAM: I guess we should all go downstairs and talk.

338
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.010
TALIESIN: I think it's time to have some breakfast

339
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.550
and maybe head downstairs.

340
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.806
Are you awake yet? I don't know.

341
00:15:47.806 --> 00:15:49.120
I hopefully didn't keep you up long.

342
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.564
ASHLEY: No, I'm awake.

343
00:15:51.564 --> 00:15:54.538
TALIESIN: You seem more alert than you've been in a while.

344
00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:56.100
ASHLEY: I do? How come?

345
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.490
TALIESIN: Ah well, I've been trying to give you

346
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.723
more caffeine lately, maybe to give you a little pick up.

347
00:16:01.723 --> 00:16:02.606
ASHLEY: Yeah, I've really noticed.

348
00:16:02.606 --> 00:16:04.490
I think it makes a difference,

349
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.100
adding a little bit more caffeine.

350
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.533
TALIESIN: It's a heavy green tea. It's got a good pickup.

351
00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:10.366
ASHLEY: Yeah, I like it a lot.

352
00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:11.957
TALIESIN: You want some breakfast?

353
00:16:11.957 --> 00:16:12.865
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm very hungry.

354
00:16:12.865 --> 00:16:16.765
TALIESIN: Let's go downstairs, then.

355
00:16:16.765 --> 00:16:17.930
LAURA: I'm going to take a little bit of time

356
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:22.920
alone in the room since Beau is gone to journal and

357
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.670
draw some stuff and let the Traveler know

358
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.420
exactly what we've been doing.

359
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.020
MATT: Okay, all right.

360
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.440
Fjord?

361
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.523
TRAVIS: Yep.

362
00:16:35.523 --> 00:16:36.818
MATT: Anything in particular, or are you

363
00:16:36.818 --> 00:16:39.880
just going down to join folks?

364
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.813
TRAVIS: Yep, going down for breakfast.

365
00:16:42.813 --> 00:16:46.850
Just the use, found some bacon.

366
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.800
MATT: Okay. As some of you begin to head down the stairs,

367
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.460
and you guys are finishing your conversation,

368
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.720
you glance over and see that Gavin, the owner

369
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.610
of the Dim's Inn, approaching the table,

370
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.490
wide-eyed and smiling through a bit

371
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:10.490
of tense crinkles in the sides of his eyes.

372
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.728
"Terribly sorry to bother you.

373
00:17:15.728 --> 00:17:18.211
"Your beasts that were delivered

374
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:20.710
"are scaring away the customers. If you could--"

375
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.093
TRAVIS: Oh, where are they?

376
00:17:23.093 --> 00:17:24.050
TALIESIN: Yeah, we should--

377
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.225
MATT: He points out there and soon as he points you hear

378
00:17:28.225 --> 00:17:32.329
(snarling and growling).

379
00:17:32.329 --> 00:17:36.017
TRAVIS: Ooh, right, yeah, the moorbounders.

380
00:17:36.017 --> 00:17:37.570
TALIESIN: We should probably do something about that.

381
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.950
TRAVIS: I think we just let them off the leash

382
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.241
and just have them at it.

383
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:42.670
Smash it up a bit around here.

384
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.410
No, wrong thing first in the morning?

385
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.740
All right, I'm open to suggestions.

386
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.056
LIAM: Is there a place you would

387
00:17:47.056 --> 00:17:49.772
recommend us putting them up so that they do not bother

388
00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:54.360
the people in the area? A stable of some sort?

389
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.250
MATT: "Your best bet would probably be the Coronas.

390
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:01.192
"Keep them chained up, just not by the front, please."

391
00:18:02.728 --> 00:18:04.530
TALIESIN: If we were to keep them on the premises,

392
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.760
is there a particular place that you would most like

393
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.490
them to be hidden if you had your pick of?

394
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.450
MATT: "The back, that would suffice."

395
00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.740
TALIESIN: Well, we'll take them into the back, no problem.

396
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.857
I'm just going to leave a gold coin on the table.

397
00:18:19.857 --> 00:18:21.149
MATT: He snatches it up.

398
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:22.157
TALIESIN: That's fair.

399
00:18:22.157 --> 00:18:23.920
MATT: At some point in the night, it seems that your

400
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.700
moorbounders were delivered and chained

401
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.865
to the front exterior of the tavern.

402
00:18:28.865 --> 00:18:32.960
The chain wrapped around some of the front porch

403
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.450
load-bearing pillars that hold

404
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.520
the second floor balcony and two of them

405
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.510
are starting to bow a bit from the tension.

406
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.128
The three of them are sitting there, curled up in the front

407
00:18:47.128 --> 00:18:48.760
pulling at the chains. One of them is biting

408
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.570
into the side of it and people are keeping

409
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.170
a very wide berth around your creatures.

410
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.750
TRAVIS: I don't know, maybe they should be paying us.

411
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.750
It seems like extra security for me.

412
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.680
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, I don't know. I can understand.

413
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.890
It does create a certain selective clientele of

414
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.860
people who feel comfortable coming within certain distance

415
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.867
of a carnivore such as this.

416
00:19:09.867 --> 00:19:11.675
Are they carnivores or are they omnivores?

417
00:19:11.675 --> 00:19:13.240
MATT: One of them proceeds to relieve itself

418
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.770
in a heaping warm pile right in front of you.

419
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.840
TALIESIN: Oh, he's comfortable here.

420
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.950
TRAVIS: That giant horse panther is definitely a carnivore.

421
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.000
LAURA: I slam open the door from the top of the stairs.

422
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.970
Do I see smell Yarnball?!

423
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.120
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's out front. Want to come say hi?

424
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.430
LAURA: Come on, Nugget, let's go!

425
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.980
MATT: Nugget catches up, still recovering from the battle

426
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.030
the previous day. A little bruised and dinged up,

427
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.062
but comes up and licks the back of your hand.

428
00:19:39.062 --> 00:19:43.335
Don't get too close to Yarnball; remember, she will eat you.

429
00:19:43.335 --> 00:19:45.001
MATT: (panting)

430
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:47.464
TALIESIN: Let's take them around back, why don't we?

431
00:19:47.464 --> 00:19:49.577
TRAVIS: All right, yeah.

432
00:19:49.577 --> 00:19:51.452
LIAM: Walk out front.

433
00:19:51.452 --> 00:19:53.230
MATT: Take them by the chains, those of you

434
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.128
who are bonded to one of them.

435
00:19:56.128 --> 00:20:00.740
The rest of you, without the touch of their trained master

436
00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.470
in the immediate proximity, a slight pet to keep

437
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.704
them calm. As soon as Fjord emerges,

438
00:20:06.704 --> 00:20:08.252
one of them goes (growls).

439
00:20:08.252 --> 00:20:11.686
LIAM: Jannik! <i>Halt dein Mund.</i>

440
00:20:11.686 --> 00:20:12.868
MATT: (sniffing)

441
00:20:12.868 --> 00:20:15.188
LIAM: <i>Gut. Gut.</i>

442
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.770
MARISHA: We spent so much money on something

443
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.170
that's going to eat us one day.

444
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.340
TALIESIN: I think it was a good investment.

445
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.173
LIAM: Come.

446
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.800
MARISHA: Speaking on the investment part, going off of

447
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.820
what Fjord was saying with security, maybe we could

448
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.210
loan them to the local guard or something

449
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.840
for a light fee while we're here?

450
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.140
LAURA: I just don't think Yarnball will

451
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.935
listen to anybody but me.
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

452
00:20:38.935 --> 00:20:40.345
They eat people, that's right.

453
00:20:40.345 --> 00:20:42.633
TALIESIN: I think maybe if they need people eating--

454
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.150
I think they probably have a system for that.

455
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.980
I'm overthinking it now.

456
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.650
TRAVIS: What are we up to this morning?

457
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.120
TALIESIN: Well, we have some errands to run if I recall.

458
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.080
LAURA: That's right, we were going to split up, weren't we?

459
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.370
SAM: Oh we were going to talk to--

460
00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.203
LIAM: Library.

461
00:21:00.203 --> 00:21:02.644
TRAVIS: Yeah, library, blacksmith,

462
00:21:02.644 --> 00:21:05.130
look for some general groceries.

463
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.813
TALIESIN: Could use a diamond--

464
00:21:06.813 --> 00:21:08.463
LAURA: We could use a diamond.

465
00:21:10.642 --> 00:21:12.673
TRAVIS: Raise your hand if you want to go seek knowledge

466
00:21:12.673 --> 00:21:14.073
and look at books and stuff.

467
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.680
SAM: I guess.
ASHLEY: Yeah okay.

468
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.910
MARISHA: Oh, we're the only enthusiastic ones about this.

469
00:21:22.218 --> 00:21:23.927
TRAVIS: That's fine. We're just deciding

470
00:21:23.927 --> 00:21:25.518
Who goes where right?

471
00:21:25.518 --> 00:21:26.925
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Sure.

472
00:21:26.925 --> 00:21:28.410
TALIESIN: I'm more of a shop browsing

473
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.180
and a blacksmith kind of--

474
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.338
LAURA: Before you guys leave,

475
00:21:31.338 --> 00:21:32.440
if you guys want us to buy diamonds

476
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.640
somebody help because I don't think we have enough

477
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.470
money to buy a bunch of diamonds and stuff.

478
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.990
LIAM: That is good investment, <i>ja</i>.

479
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.490
LAURA: Who wants to give us all their money?

480
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.117
LIAM: Well, not all of the money.

481
00:21:42.117 --> 00:21:44.110
LAURA: It's a really good thing we're doing.

482
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.170
TALIESIN: It's just better safe than sorry.

483
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.636
LAURA: We can also buy some candy and some pretty dresses

484
00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:50.202
if we want to, with their money.

485
00:21:50.202 --> 00:21:51.507
TALIESIN: We could.

486
00:21:51.507 --> 00:21:53.706
SAM: How much does
your diamond need to cost?

487
00:21:53.706 --> 00:21:54.831
LAURA: 300?

488
00:21:54.831 --> 00:21:56.330
TALIESIN: Oh no, let's take a look, there's a--

489
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.147
LAURA: There's a bigger one, though, now.

490
00:21:58.147 --> 00:22:01.559
LIAM: I place 20 platinum in Jester's hand.

491
00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:02.734
SAM: Whoa!

492
00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:05.640
You need that, we're about to go find books and stuff.

493
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.540
LAURA: Thank you Caleb.
LIAM: Jester is going

494
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.100
to take that, if we are going to be exploring this country

495
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.010
we don't know what we're going to run into,

496
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.250
so that is for the party.

497
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.970
SAM: You need paper and ink.

498
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.440
TALIESIN: I think they're all 500gp, if I remember--

499
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.700
LIAM: We'll figure that out.

500
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.108
LAURA: 300 was Revivify.

501
00:22:21.108 --> 00:22:23.291
TALIESIN: --the size of the diamond.

502
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:26.199
MATT: Revivify is 300 gold worth of diamonds.

503
00:22:26.199 --> 00:22:28.890
500 for the Raise Dead, yeah.

504
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:33.380
MARISHA: I hand over 50 gold.
LIAM: That's 250 total.

505
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.240
ASHLEY: I'll hand over another 50.

506
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.600
TALIESIN: Thank you.
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

507
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.980
SAM: How much you need total, 800?

508
00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.720
TALIESIN: It would be nice but that's also

509
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.320
assuming we're going to find some diamonds.

510
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.740
LAURA: We also put some of our money in.

511
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.290
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got money ourselves.

512
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.118
LAURA: You're going to give some money too?

513
00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:49.442
TRAVIS: No, I'm coming with you.

514
00:22:49.442 --> 00:22:50.518
LAURA: Oh, that's fun.

515
00:22:50.518 --> 00:22:52.550
SAM: Here I'll give you a hundred gold.

516
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.313
LAURA: Thank you, Nott.

517
00:22:54.313 --> 00:22:56.513
TALIESIN: Everyone's pitching in, that's good.

518
00:22:56.513 --> 00:22:58.240
LAURA: It's a team effort.

519
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.340
This is again, assuming that we're going to find--

520
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.190
LAURA: Yeah.

521
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.952
But I feel like there's got to be some nice things.

522
00:23:02.952 --> 00:23:04.423
You saw the Bright Queen's armor, they've got

523
00:23:04.423 --> 00:23:05.523
to have really cool stuff here.

524
00:23:05.523 --> 00:23:06.865
TALIESIN: It was really pretty.

525
00:23:06.865 --> 00:23:08.445
LAURA: I think there were opals on it.

526
00:23:08.445 --> 00:23:10.100
TALIESIN: I like opals.
LAURA: They were so beautiful.

527
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.012
TALIESIN: They were the best.
TRAVIS: Should we meet up

528
00:23:12.012 --> 00:23:14.330
at a certain time and/or place?

529
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.638
MARISHA: Back at the inn?

530
00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.140
LIAM: Sure.

531
00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.371
TALIESIN: Back at the inn and just send a message

532
00:23:20.371 --> 00:23:22.490
if you should decide we should meet somewhere else.

533
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.060
LIAM: All right.

534
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.870
Who's going with you?

535
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:29.230
Is it you two?
TALIESIN: I'm going with me.

536
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.807
LAURA: And Fjord is coming too.

537
00:23:30.807 --> 00:23:32.376
LIAM: Would you do me a favor?

538
00:23:32.376 --> 00:23:33.910
ASHLEY: I'll go with you guys.

539
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.890
LIAM: You're generally shopping as well then?

540
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:36.723
LAURA: Sure.

541
00:23:36.723 --> 00:23:37.956
LIAM: Would you do me a favor--

542
00:23:37.956 --> 00:23:39.498
LAURA: Look for some fucking paper?

543
00:23:39.498 --> 00:23:43.313
LIAM: No, we'll take care of that, but a straight razor.

544
00:23:43.313 --> 00:23:46.621
LAURA: Do you need to shave?

545
00:23:47.605 --> 00:23:48.438
TALIESIN: Does he need to shave?

546
00:23:48.438 --> 00:23:49.350
LAURA: Yasha can do it.

547
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.813
MATT: He always need to shave.

548
00:23:50.813 --> 00:23:53.610
ASHLEY: I can always give you another shave again.

549
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.270
LIAM: Well, that's good, you know.

550
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.883
You know, for fun once in a while,

551
00:23:59.883 --> 00:24:01.958
but I don't want to trouble you constantly and--

552
00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:03.640
ASHLEY: No, it's really no trouble.

553
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.820
I actually really like doing it,

554
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.259
but I understand if you want to have something

555
00:24:08.259 --> 00:24:09.908
a little bit more portable.

556
00:24:09.908 --> 00:24:11.530
TALIESIN: I mean you're very portable.

557
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.380
You can walk yourself anywhere you need to go.

558
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.213
ASHLEY: That's true.

559
00:24:14.213 --> 00:24:15.679
LIAM: We'll do that later tonight.

560
00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:17.420
Still please look for the razor for me.

561
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.150
LAURA: Straight razor, got it.

562
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:19.983
SAM: Okay, you know what?

563
00:24:19.983 --> 00:24:21.830
Caleb, if it's all right with you I think I'll go

564
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.030
with the shopping party as well, because Yeza might need

565
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.085
some new clothes and stuff and I can take him along as well.

566
00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:29.226
LIAM: Of course.

567
00:24:29.226 --> 00:24:30.930
MATT: "Some shoes might be good too."

568
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.167
SAM: Yeah, well we'll just go shopping and then--

569
00:24:33.167 --> 00:24:34.580
LIAM: Do you have enough coin?

570
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.430
SAM: Yes, I'm fine thank you.

571
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.738
TRAVIS: What about you buddy,

572
00:24:37.738 --> 00:24:38.738
you want to come with the shopping party

573
00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:40.115
and make the flip flop complete?

574
00:24:40.115 --> 00:24:41.530
Send Caleb out there by himself?

575
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.930
MARISHA: I mean as humorous as that is to me,

576
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.340
I'm interested in books.

577
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.298
TALIESIN: It would be best not to

578
00:24:48.298 --> 00:24:49.747
send anybody solo anywhere,

579
00:24:49.747 --> 00:24:51.520
it's always good to have a buddy.

580
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.288
MARISHA: Buddy system.

581
00:24:53.288 --> 00:24:56.180
Buddy system.
LIAM: Buddy system.

582
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.587
MARISHA: Buddy system.
LIAM: Buddy system.

583
00:24:58.587 --> 00:25:00.050
LAURA: Before they leave though

584
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.680
I want to talk to you about--
MARISHA: Oh, yeah?

585
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.633
LAURA: I have a really important thing I need to ask of you.

586
00:25:05.633 --> 00:25:08.170
MARISHA: Do we need to step away, are we good?

587
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.310
LAURA: Yeah, let's step away.
MARISHA: Okay.

588
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.440
MATT: You step away.

589
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.273
LAURA: When you're in the library,

590
00:25:16.273 --> 00:25:17.880
I need you to do something for me.

591
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.905
MARISHA: Okay.

592
00:25:18.905 --> 00:25:21.021
LAURA: I need you to draw a couple of dicks

593
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:23.130
in the books, okay?
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

594
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.240
LAURA: Make sure it happens because I won't be there

595
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.880
to do it for myself and it's really important.

596
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.190
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

597
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.600
Is this for Traveler Con?

598
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.308
You mentioned--
LAURA: Sure, let's say that.

599
00:25:34.308 --> 00:25:36.570
Sure, it's definitely for that.

600
00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.692
MARISHA: Oh.
LAURA: Also, if you want to

601
00:25:38.692 --> 00:25:42.290
to draw some people naked in there or like--

602
00:25:43.462 --> 00:25:44.850
MARISHA: I'll look for the ass trumpeters

603
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.155
that are sometimes in the margins and then it will

604
00:25:47.155 --> 00:25:48.163
just blend right in.

605
00:25:48.163 --> 00:25:49.813
LAURA: Oh my gosh that would be so wonderful.

606
00:25:49.813 --> 00:25:51.110
MARISHA: Yeah, it'll be great.

607
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.450
LAURA: Thank you.

608
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.580
TALIESIN: I just got that reference, carry on.

609
00:25:58.128 --> 00:25:59.720
MATT: All right, so it's the two of you heading

610
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.077
towards the conservatory, the Marble Tomes?

611
00:26:03.077 --> 00:26:04.543
The Marble Tomes.

612
00:26:04.543 --> 00:26:08.530
TRAVIS: Meet back at the inn at what time, high 12 o'clock?

613
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:10.480
SAM: You've got your medallions right?

614
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.210
You're two humans on your own, you've got your medallions

615
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.870
of protection right?
LAURA: Hmm, that's a

616
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.280
really good point.
SAM: The medallions

617
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.120
that the Bright Queen gave us.

618
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.710
LIAM: Of course, of course.
SAM: Okay, if anyone gives you

619
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.210
trouble have that at the ready.

620
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.354
Not in a back pocket, not in--
TRAVIS: Are you listening?

621
00:26:27.354 --> 00:26:29.277
MARISHA: Yeah, what?
SAM: Have that in your

622
00:26:29.277 --> 00:26:31.690
front pocket ready to flash it.

623
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.581
LIAM: All right Veth, we have it.

624
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.065
SAM: Let me see it.

625
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.813
Okay.

626
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.461
You pass. Beau?

627
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.840
SAM: That's a stick.

628
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.948
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

629
00:26:46.015 --> 00:26:47.748
Sorry, I haven't showered
in a while.

630
00:26:47.748 --> 00:26:49.098
TRAVIS: What are you doing

631
00:26:49.098 --> 00:26:51.127
with a random ass stick in your armpit?

632
00:26:51.127 --> 00:26:53.160
MARISHA: Look, we went down a well,

633
00:26:54.651 --> 00:26:56.877
I fought Dairon in the woods.

634
00:26:56.877 --> 00:26:57.710
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

635
00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:01.800
A lot's happened.

636
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.640
LAURA: I think you should probably bathe soon.

637
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.799
MARISHA: Is it bad?
TALIESIN: I think you're fine.

638
00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.585
ASHLEY: (sniffs) I don't smell anything actually.

639
00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:10.287
LIAM: I don't smell a single thing.

640
00:27:10.287 --> 00:27:11.735
MARISHA: Okay, let's break.

641
00:27:11.735 --> 00:27:13.939
TRAVIS: Okay, ready... break.

642
00:27:13.939 --> 00:27:15.997
(out-of-sync clapping)

643
00:27:15.997 --> 00:27:17.841
(laughing)

644
00:27:17.841 --> 00:27:19.641
TALIESIN: We're dead.
MATT: Well-oiled machine.

645
00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.173
All righty.

646
00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:24.059
TRAVIS: Level nine.
(ALL) Level nine.

647
00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:25.740
Level nine.

648
00:27:27.975 --> 00:27:32.975
MATT: All righty, so you guys part into Rosohna.

649
00:27:34.966 --> 00:27:37.120
Where are you guys heading first?

650
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.510
What are you looking for?

651
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.010
TALIESIN: I'm trying to find a blacksmith,

652
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.390
because I'm still trying to find somebody

653
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.310
who can do something with this.

654
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.360
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

655
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.843
TALIESIN: Oh boy, can I get some help with this?

656
00:27:46.843 --> 00:27:48.607
TRAVIS: Can I help him?
MATT: Yeah, you can do it.

657
00:27:48.607 --> 00:27:49.590
TALIESIN: This is embarrassing.

658
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.722
MATT: Are you going to each

659
00:27:50.722 --> 00:27:52.418
roll independently?
TRAVIS: Yeah, independently.

660
00:27:52.418 --> 00:27:54.190
TALIESIN: My investigation is sad.

661
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.470
TRAVIS: 20.
MATT: All right.

662
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.222
TALIESIN: 5.
Okay, well be glad

663
00:28:00.222 --> 00:28:03.790
that Fjord helped. Half the journey is you taking

664
00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.150
Caduceus and going, I think it's this way.

665
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.717
TALIESIN: It smells so good over there--

666
00:28:07.717 --> 00:28:09.567
TRAVIS: That's a pottery shop.

667
00:28:09.567 --> 00:28:11.058
MATT: Eventually you come upon--

668
00:28:11.058 --> 00:28:12.241
LAURA: Oh my god!

669
00:28:13.808 --> 00:28:16.725
(laughter)

670
00:28:18.949 --> 00:28:20.390
TRAVIS: It's so big though.

671
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.597
LAURA: You could drown in that.

672
00:28:22.597 --> 00:28:23.822
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

673
00:28:23.822 --> 00:28:24.996
MATT: You know that GIF

674
00:28:24.996 --> 00:28:27.230
of Will Farrell trying to drink wine while

675
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.700
he's in the moving bed and it's spilling everywhere.

676
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.220
One of these days, one of these days.

677
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.830
TALIESIN: I'll see what it says later, on Monday.

678
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.690
ASHLEY: Oh my god!

679
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.498
TRAVIS: That's a special, special boy.

680
00:28:39.498 --> 00:28:41.077
LIAM: That's all yours, Ashley.

681
00:28:41.077 --> 00:28:43.235
ASHLEY: It sure is.

682
00:28:43.235 --> 00:28:45.068
MATT: After what could have been

683
00:28:45.068 --> 00:28:49.540
a bit of meandering travel, through your keen eye,

684
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.532
you guys manage to come upon a place called

685
00:28:51.532 --> 00:28:55.890
the Hammered Call. It's not robust in its size,

686
00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.250
but it seems well-built and sturdy and you can

687
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.210
smell the burning materials that are used to maintain

688
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.820
the forge. You don't hear any hammering

689
00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.300
necessarily at the moment, but it does seem to be a

690
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.180
fairly well-constructed smithy.

691
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.530
As you approach the front door, there's nobody

692
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.230
currently in there doing business,

693
00:29:20.031 --> 00:29:21.900
but you do see in the back corner in the middle

694
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.614
of eating something, some sort of

695
00:29:24.614 --> 00:29:28.600
gray brown material out of a small satchel,

696
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.400
a tall and built half-orc.

697
00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:37.290
You see a thin chin beard of tough, course black hair

698
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:41.550
bald head, arms covered in tattoos from mid-bicep

699
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:45.500
right down to the wrist, wearing thick leather apron,

700
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.670
trousers, no shirt under the vest and is just

701
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.060
sweating on the very edges,

702
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.830
the interior temperature as the forge

703
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.880
was only very recently put to use where he stopped

704
00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.530
to take his break, so it's pretty warm on the inside.

705
00:30:01.672 --> 00:30:04.639
You see him taking a big mouthful of whatever he's eating

706
00:30:04.639 --> 00:30:06.915
and he stops, continues to chew and just looks at you all

707
00:30:06.915 --> 00:30:08.665
with this very focused eyes.

708
00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.660
TALIESIN: Excuse me, friend.

709
00:30:12.112 --> 00:30:12.945
MATT: "Yeah?"

710
00:30:13.913 --> 00:30:16.079
TALIESIN: Are you artisan that operates

711
00:30:17.854 --> 00:30:19.804
these amazing devices?

712
00:30:21.925 --> 00:30:25.150
MATT: (grunts) Takes this little feed satchel off

713
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.400
and sets it on the side and stands up.

714
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.990
Standing up he's pushing about seven foot,

715
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.690
he's a very tall bugger, so he's about as tall as you are.

716
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:37.100
Eye to eye. And this guy's been doing a forge

717
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.833
for a long time, the immediate comparison of

718
00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:41.925
half-orc him to half-orc Fjord,

719
00:30:41.925 --> 00:30:43.691
it's a Laurel and Hardy sketch.

720
00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:45.564
TALIESIN: His neck has a six pack, kind of thing.

721
00:30:45.564 --> 00:30:46.489
MATT: Yeah.

722
00:30:48.686 --> 00:30:50.695
(accent similar to Fjord's) "I don't think

723
00:30:50.695 --> 00:30:52.419
I'm familiar with your kind."

724
00:30:52.419 --> 00:30:55.150
TALIESIN: Honestly, my friend, we don't travel that often,

725
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.510
we tend to stay where we are.

726
00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.320
I haven't seen any firbolgs at all

727
00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.690
since I've come to this city.

728
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.115
MATT: "Welcome, welcome.
Thanks for coming around."

729
00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:06.705
TALIESIN: Oh, it's a pleasure.

730
00:31:06.705 --> 00:31:08.088
We've been having a lovely time.

731
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.840
MATT: "So I work here, what do you need?"

732
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.680
TALIESIN: Well, I have a bit of a conundrum really.

733
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.533
I have this blade that I came across and sort of--

734
00:31:19.533 --> 00:31:24.533
in, shall we say, spectacular circumstances

735
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.210
and I've been trying, hoping as I've traveled across

736
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.730
the land--and we have traveled very far--

737
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:35.670
to find someone who would know how to bring it back to life.

738
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:38.780
It's something I've been knowing

739
00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.189
that I will find eventually.

740
00:31:41.189 --> 00:31:42.554
MATT: "Let me have a look."

741
00:31:42.554 --> 00:31:44.720
He takes it, tattoos are beautiful and intricate.

742
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.158
TALIESIN: Recognize anything on them?

743
00:31:47.158 --> 00:31:48.358
MATT: Make a perception check.

744
00:31:48.358 --> 00:31:51.370
TALIESIN: Ooh, that I can do.

745
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.690
13, no better than that. Oh my god, my numbers now. 19.

746
00:31:55.957 --> 00:31:59.470
MATT: Nice! Just a series of lines

747
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:03.825
that wrap around each other like a soft maze-type design.

748
00:32:03.825 --> 00:32:06.130
He reaches out and takes the blade.

749
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:10.460
Underneath the forearm, it looks like there is an actual--

750
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:15.250
there's a jaggedness to it at times that seems intentional,

751
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.250
like it's a shape of something; it's not just a design.

752
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:23.130
It's capturing some sort of not-geometric shape.

753
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.127
TALIESIN: I have a friend who's trying to learn how to

754
00:32:27.127 --> 00:32:28.185
tattoo right now.

755
00:32:28.185 --> 00:32:30.259
That's some spectacular work you have there.

756
00:32:30.259 --> 00:32:32.478
MATT: "Thank you, I appreciate that."

757
00:32:32.478 --> 00:32:34.070
TALIESIN: If things go well, I may send her around,

758
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.840
that's if you're all right with that.

759
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.300
I think she would be most impressed.

760
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.516
MATT: "Certainly. She's liable to look,

761
00:32:40.516 --> 00:32:43.783
"but it's not something you can really teach.

762
00:32:43.783 --> 00:32:47.560
"These are important to my hometown,

763
00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.510
"so wouldn't recommend her giving them out."

764
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.360
TALIESIN: Oh, no. I think she would just

765
00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.450
really enjoy seeing them.

766
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:58.210
TRAVIS: Your hometown? Where are you from?

767
00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:02.435
MATT: Gives you a look over. Make a persuasion check.

768
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.703
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's cocked.

769
00:33:08.703 --> 00:33:11.729
23.

770
00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:13.614
MATT: He looks you over and grins and goes,

771
00:33:13.614 --> 00:33:18.614
"Heh, you're inquisitive, runt. I like it.

772
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:24.301
"These tattoos are from a place

773
00:33:24.301 --> 00:33:28.418
"in the Greying Wildlands where I grew up.

774
00:33:28.418 --> 00:33:33.418
"Boraftkrah. It's a village out there in the Rime Plains."

775
00:33:34.613 --> 00:33:36.063
TRAVIS: Boraftkrah?

776
00:33:36.063 --> 00:33:39.980
MATT: "Yeah. Left home when I felt an urge to travel south,

777
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.220
"learn more of my craft. Found the Dynasty

778
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.461
"and well, here we are.

779
00:33:45.461 --> 00:33:49.610
"These are designs of the nearby Dunrock

780
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.910
"on the north side where our village

781
00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:56.304
"and our hunting grounds were."

782
00:33:56.304 --> 00:33:57.420
TALIESIN: I think that's a very interesting.

783
00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.630
This is actually our first day--if you can call it that--

784
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.680
in the city. We've never been here before.

785
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're a--
MATT: "Where are you all from?

786
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.767
"You're asking me my background; I'm real curious now."

787
00:34:08.767 --> 00:34:12.243
TALIESIN: We're everywhere all of us, different places.

788
00:34:12.243 --> 00:34:17.140
I'm from a very small temple

789
00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.880
that's deep in the forests

790
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.710
north of the Empire, very far north.

791
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.470
MATT: "That's kind of where I'm from.

792
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:28.140
"What forest do you come from?"

793
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.465
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, I don't know

794
00:34:30.465 --> 00:34:31.772
if you've ever been there before,

795
00:34:31.772 --> 00:34:35.570
but have you ever heard of the Blooming Grove?

796
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.611
MATT: "Blooming Grove. Can't say I have, sorry."

797
00:34:38.611 --> 00:34:39.786
TALIESIN: It's in the Greying Wildlands.

798
00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:41.019
MATT: "Greying Wildlands is

799
00:34:41.019 --> 00:34:44.750
"where I'm from, but there's only really--"

800
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:48.630
TALIESIN: You've never heard of the Blooming Grove before?

801
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.680
Oh wait, wait, the Bone Orchard?

802
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.104
MATT: "That sounds familiar."

803
00:34:54.104 --> 00:34:56.046
TALIESIN: I thought that might.

804
00:34:56.046 --> 00:34:58.825
I never got used to that one.

805
00:34:58.825 --> 00:35:01.817
MATT: "Are you saying that's the Savalierwood?"

806
00:35:01.817 --> 00:35:03.120
TALIESIN: Yeah, I recall that's what people said.

807
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.100
MATT: "You live in the Savalierwood?"

808
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.530
TALIESIN: Yeah, if I recall.

809
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.246
MATT: "You're a crazy motherfucker."

810
00:35:08.246 --> 00:35:10.296
TALIESIN: That's what some people have said. That's fair.

811
00:35:10.296 --> 00:35:12.871
MATT: "All right, all right."

812
00:35:12.871 --> 00:35:15.610
TRAVIS: You're so vertically challenged,

813
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:19.593
everyone like you from the...

814
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.526
Morathkrah

815
00:35:23.526 --> 00:35:26.700
the same, you know, stature?

816
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.710
MATT: "Generally, yeah, we're big. Oh you should see

817
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.540
"the full-blooded orcs up there, plenty of them.

818
00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.473
"They're a little bigger.

819
00:35:36.473 --> 00:35:39.740
"Well, one of the clans, anyway."

820
00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.270
TRAVIS: Yeah, not as huge down the

821
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:46.260
Menagerie Coast. I'm from Port Damali.

822
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.934
MATT: "Oh, you went and grown up

823
00:35:48.934 --> 00:35:51.570
"in some of that human territory."

824
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:53.680
TRAVIS: Yeah, not too many of us.

825
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.610
MATT: "Explains a lot."

826
00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:00.509
TRAVIS: Yeah, well you do the best with what you've got.

827
00:36:00.509 --> 00:36:03.220
MATT: "Don't be ashamed of that, son."

828
00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.090
TRAVIS: No, I ain't ashamed.

829
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.290
MATT: "Look at you, you're mobile.

830
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.190
"Me, I hit things real hard,

831
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:16.860
"but I spend most of my day in here where it's

832
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.100
"bothering me with the heat.

833
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.520
"You've being from the Menagerie Coast,

834
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.170
"I imagine you've seen quite a bit, too, in your days."

835
00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.983
TRAVIS: Yeah, it doesn't bother me so much.

836
00:36:26.983 --> 00:36:28.956
MATT: "Good."

837
00:36:28.956 --> 00:36:30.322
TALIESIN: Mr. Fjord has saved my life

838
00:36:30.322 --> 00:36:33.660
on a couple of occasions, actually.

839
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.770
SAM: Yeah, it's true. He can carry a barrel with only

840
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:41.060
just a little bit of assistance from one of our ladies.

841
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.150
TRAVIS: Okay, disregard my little goblin friend over here.

842
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:49.150
She's excited by big muscular types.

843
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.610
SAM: I've seen it sir, he can lift--

844
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:57.051
TRAVIS: Many barrels by myself. Unaided. Yep.

845
00:36:57.051 --> 00:36:59.965
SAM: He's stopped paying attention at this point

846
00:36:59.965 --> 00:37:03.240
and is looking over the handle and the hilt

847
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.620
and the edges, the very bottom part of the broken blade.

848
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.690
TALIESIN: It's intriguing.

849
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:14.348
MATT: "I mean, the technique used

850
00:37:14.348 --> 00:37:17.590
"in the construction of this thing is definitely--

851
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:21.030
"while we're on the topic--from up north."

852
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.390
TALIESIN: It's what people have told me.

853
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:24.110
I just keep hoping that I'm going to find somebody

854
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.640
who knows what to do with it.

855
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.740
MATT: "It's Uthodurnian.

856
00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.098
"You'd have to probably take it there."

857
00:37:29.098 --> 00:37:30.250
TRAVIS: Luthogurnian?

858
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.025
MATT: "Uthodurnian."

859
00:37:32.025 --> 00:37:34.000
TRAVIS: Uthodurnian. Sorry, short ears.

860
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.966
MATT: "It's where them dwarves and elves live together."

861
00:37:38.966 --> 00:37:43.703
TALIESIN: Good to know. I keep--

862
00:37:43.703 --> 00:37:45.980
That's a place that eventually I hope to go to then

863
00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.669
or at least find somebody from.

864
00:37:48.669 --> 00:37:50.610
MATT: "Well, if you do, careful on the Rime Plains.

865
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:55.610
"I mean, my folks from my village are just hunting,

866
00:37:56.410 --> 00:38:00.030
"surviving, getting by. The northern orcs

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.630
"and those are beginning to push into the Alps there,

868
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.080
"they're a little more bloodthirsty."

869
00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.780
TALIESIN: Any advice, one wanderer to another,

870
00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.020
if we ever come across your people

871
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:13.570
of the best way to keep ourselves properly ingratiated?

872
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:18.049
MATT: "Square your shoulders and don't bow."

873
00:38:18.049 --> 00:38:19.915
TALIESIN: I can do that.

874
00:38:19.915 --> 00:38:21.950
MATT: "Okay."

875
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:23.510
TALIESIN: Absolute pleasure.

876
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.973
MATT: "Anything else I can help you with?

877
00:38:24.973 --> 00:38:26.198
"Any other questions you got?"

878
00:38:26.198 --> 00:38:28.820
TALIESIN: You wouldn't happen to know where to get a jewel

879
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.240
or a diamond? We're looking to buy some jewels

880
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.030
if you would know if there's some around town?

881
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.670
MATT: "Hmm, there's probably Fadden's Gems.

882
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:40.830
"I haven't been in there. Not really a gem-wearing person

883
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.980
"and to be honest, most of the finer weaponry

"I'm trained, but I'm not

00:38:54.844 --> 00:38:58.427
a master craftsmen, if you will.

888
00:38:58.427 --> 00:39:00.510
"They don't let us in all the firing forges."

889
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:05.448
TRAVIS: Jewelry wearing for softer folk. (spits)

890
00:39:07.305 --> 00:39:10.048
MATT: (laughs)

891
00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:12.540
TALIESIN: We appreciate your time and appreciate

892
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.932
you taking a moment of your day for that.

893
00:39:14.932 --> 00:39:16.757
LAURA: I come in from inside.

894
00:39:16.757 --> 00:39:19.190
What's taking so long--holy moly.

895
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.978
TALIESIN: My friend, who I was speaking of.

896
00:39:20.978 --> 00:39:22.461
LAURA: You're really big.

897
00:39:22.461 --> 00:39:23.561
MATT: "You're really blue."

898
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:26.180
LAURA: Yes, I am.
MATT: "Yes, I am."

899
00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.730
LAURA: I like your tattoos those are really cool.

900
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.497
MATT: "Thank you kindly."

901
00:39:32.497 --> 00:39:35.400
ASHLEY: She's the one that he was talking about.

902
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.830
She does really good tattoos.

903
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.920
LAURA: I do really good tattoos, want me to do one for you?

904
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.211
MATT: "I'm fine, but thank you."

905
00:39:41.211 --> 00:39:43.053
LAURA: If you ever change your mind,

906
00:39:43.053 --> 00:39:44.544
you know where to find me.

907
00:39:44.544 --> 00:39:45.619
SAM: She's really good.

908
00:39:45.619 --> 00:39:47.410
LAURA: Do you know where to find me?

909
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.916
We're staying at the Den's Inn or something.

910
00:39:50.916 --> 00:39:52.200
I show him the medallion.

911
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.280
We're friends of the Dynasty. We're really cool and stuff.

912
00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.830
TALIESIN: Ixnay on the ynastyday.

913
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.180
MATT: "All righty, well, I didn't realize

914
00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.490
"I was in the presence of such

915
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.890
"whatever the word is for your people."

916
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:09.743
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't judge a book by its cover, friend.

917
00:40:09.743 --> 00:40:11.680
TALIESIN: You've been more than helpful.

918
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.547
I'm actually going to tip a gold piece.

919
00:40:14.547 --> 00:40:17.070
Time is always valuable.

920
00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.900
MATT: "Well, I appreciate that, keeping me company here

921
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.250
"in this blasting heat." he puts a foot down in the bellows

922
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:27.410
and the forge flares up a bit, the orange glow fills

923
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.800
the chamber a bit and the temperature jumps for a moment.

924
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.880
TALIESIN: Well, when you have a need, you'll be the first

925
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.460
we find, thank you friend.

926
00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.230
ASHLEY: Wait, what was your name again?

927
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.892
MATT: "Wursh. Wursh the Tapper."

928
00:40:40.892 --> 00:40:43.292
ASHLEY: Wursh, I actually don't think

929
00:40:43.292 --> 00:40:47.350
we got your name at all. So sorry, Wursh.

930
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.478
LAURA: I'm Jester.

931
00:40:49.478 --> 00:40:51.680
MATT: "Hi, Jester."
LAURA: Hi.

932
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.200
TALIESIN: Caduceus Clay, of the Clays.

933
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.660
Anyway, we should be heading off.

934
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.010
MATT: "What's your name?"

935
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.651
TRAVIS: I leave.

936
00:41:02.676 --> 00:41:04.884
MARISHA: Ooh shit.

937
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:07.143
MATT: "All right."

938
00:41:07.143 --> 00:41:09.250
SAM: His name's Fjord.

939
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.974
MATT: "Fjord."

940
00:41:10.974 --> 00:41:13.407
SAM: Yeah, Fjord Tough.

941
00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.540
Have you heard of him or something?

942
00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.711
MATT: No, he walks toward the edge and

943
00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:29.777
looks toward the door and goes, "Hey,

944
00:41:31.154 --> 00:41:35.471
"come here a second, I want to talk to you."

945
00:41:35.471 --> 00:41:36.780
MARISHA: What is happening, what is happening?

946
00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.372
TRAVIS: What do you need?

947
00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.280
MATT: "You said you grew up in Menagerie Coast, right?"

948
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.822
TRAVIS: Right.

949
00:41:47.822 --> 00:41:50.950
MATT: "'Round hoity-toity human folk?"

950
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:52.848
TRAVIS: Yep.

951
00:41:52.848 --> 00:41:56.010
MATT: You walk around like you got something to prove?

952
00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.790
TRAVIS: Is that what it looks like?

953
00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:02.790
MATT: "From where I'm standing, yeah.

954
00:42:02.924 --> 00:42:04.580
"Because I'm going to tell you something.

955
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:08.063
"It don't matter.

956
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.060
"Yeah, we got history.

957
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:17.130
"Some of us, we don't let that blood rule us, huh?

958
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.690
"I know you feel the anger there every now and then,

959
00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.770
"but don't let them define you."

960
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.260
TRAVIS: What blood you talking about?

961
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.785
MATT: "Well, this blood."

962
00:42:32.785 --> 00:42:34.318
And he scratches the side of his shoulder

963
00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:35.920
and bleeds a bit from his fingernails,

964
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.260
they're grimy and you see the coal and dirt and stuff

965
00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.310
that's got into them.

966
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.330
"The blood that we came from.

967
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.870
"Don't be ashamed of that."

968
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.313
TRAVIS: They don't look unkindly on our kind

969
00:42:52.313 --> 00:42:54.160
where you come from?

970
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.960
MATT: "Hm, don't get too many human folk up north."

971
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.810
TRAVIS: Why'd you come here anyway?

972
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.660
MATT: "Well, I had an apprenticeship up north,

973
00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.940
"I was trying to go for it, but it's a bit dangerous

974
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.320
"in the Alps to get to the sanctum so I headed south.

975
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.470
TRAVIS: Dangerous for someone your size?

976
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.200
MATT: "When you're traveling solo yeah."

977
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.470
TRAVIS: If you had the right folk heading up that way,

978
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.530
would you consider heading up there again?

979
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.170
MATT: He looks around the shop.

980
00:43:35.332 --> 00:43:37.030
(groans) "Maybe.

981
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:40.440
"Making easy money here, not too bad.

982
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:46.110
"Feeling a little, I don't know,

983
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.760
"stifled by all this night,

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.480
"but you know I'm learning, I'm training.

00:43:59.348 --> 00:44:01.472
"Look, I don't want to take too much of your time.

986
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.305
"I'm just saying.

987
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.970
"You walking everywhere with your pelvis forward like that

988
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:10.110
"and looking to start a fight with anybody that calls you

989
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:15.110
"on, well, that attitude, you're going to end up shivved.

990
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.020
TRAVIS: I appreciate you looking out.

991
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.962
MATT: "Just saying. Don't let any of that

992
00:44:25.962 --> 00:44:27.438
"bullshit affect you.

993
00:44:27.438 --> 00:44:28.900
"Just be confident in who you are.

994
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.350
"Don't try and prove anything."

995
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.690
TRAVIS: Try not to let the heat get to you in here.

996
00:44:38.195 --> 00:44:40.345
I'm sure we'll see each other again, Wursh.

997
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:43.980
MATT: "Maybe Fjord. Maybe."

998
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.780
TRAVIS: I reach out my hand.

999
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.582
He turns, stops and is like--

1000
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.370
TRAVIS: His fingers wrap around.

1001
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:53.719
MATT: Yeah, it's like a--

1002
00:44:55.473 --> 00:44:59.140
He heads on inside and he shoulders past you all.

1003
00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.390
TALIESIN: I don't know how he did that, that was amazing.

1004
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.750
LAURA: Did you see how many abs he had?

1005
00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:08.740
TALIESIN: I mean even his advice had abs, that was crazy.

1006
00:45:10.465 --> 00:45:11.960
TRAVIS: His advice?

1007
00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.468
TALIESIN: It just like broke through

1008
00:45:13.468 --> 00:45:14.926
layers of walls with that guy.

1009
00:45:17.447 --> 00:45:19.446
How did that happen?

1010
00:45:19.446 --> 00:45:21.000
TRAVIS: Cool tattoos huh?
LAURA: Really cool tattoos.

1011
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.384
TALIESIN: Super cool tattoos.
They were very impressive.

1012
00:45:23.384 --> 00:45:24.801
LAURA: He's pretty cool.

1013
00:45:24.801 --> 00:45:26.420
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1014
00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:27.769
ASHLEY: He seemed like a super nice guy.

1015
00:45:27.769 --> 00:45:28.940
TALIESIN: Seemed really nice.

1016
00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:29.773
LAURA: Yeah.

1017
00:45:31.541 --> 00:45:32.890
TRAVIS: What else do we need?

1018
00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.723
SAM: Shoes for my husband.
MATT: "Yes, please."

1019
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:42.420
LAURA: And some diamonds.
TALIESIN: Sundries and gems.

1020
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.253
LAURA: Yeah.

1021
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.992
LIAM: (as Sol Rosenberg) Do we have any shoes and glasses

1022
00:45:46.992 --> 00:45:49.100
so that I can have them?

1023
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.358
TALIESIN: Let's find some sundries--

1024
00:45:52.358 --> 00:45:54.271
LAURA: As we walk I pat his

1025
00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:57.840
shoulder and I say, don't worry Fjord you have

1026
00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.070
really good abs too I felt them.

1027
00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.520
TRAVIS: Jester, you don't have to make me feel better--

1028
00:46:03.358 --> 00:46:04.770
LAURA: You're taller than me, you're really tall

1029
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.820
in comparison to me.
TRAVIS: Yep, I sure am.

1030
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.430
That was just a very large gentleman in there.

1031
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.580
LAURA: Yeah, he's pretty big, but sometimes

1032
00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.980
that's not a good thing, sometimes being

1033
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.730
a normal size is good too.
TRAVIS: A normal size?

1034
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.350
LAURA: Yeah, like me that's a good thing--

1035
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.690
TRAVIS: I happen to be above average--

1036
00:46:24.606 --> 00:46:25.480
TRAVIS: Then somebody's who even bigger than normal

1037
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:28.240
like you are is really good too, it's like a nice thing.

1038
00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.290
Shit, help me Yasha.
ASHLEY: No it's okay.

1039
00:46:31.263 --> 00:46:33.980
You look great.
TRAVIS: I look up at Yasha.

1040
00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:37.590
ASHLEY: Yes, you're so close to me in size.

1041
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:42.420
Wait, is some of your family as big as him?

1042
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.920
TRAVIS: I don't know my family so I don't think so.

1043
00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.340
TALIESIN: Insight check.
MATT: Make an insight check.

1044
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.200
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was an insight check.

1045
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.340
SAM: Aggressive move.
TALIESIN: I have been waiting

1046
00:46:55.340 --> 00:47:00.340
for something. That's a 22.
SAM: Yes.

1047
00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.900
MATT: 22.
TRAVIS: I don't know

1048
00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.700
who my family is.
TALIESIN: Cool all right.

1049
00:47:06.547 --> 00:47:08.120
ASHLEY: You've never known your family?

1050
00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.680
TRAVIS: Nope, I'm an orphan.
TALIESIN: Really?

1051
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.902
SAM: Well, that guy could have been

1052
00:47:12.902 --> 00:47:13.780
your cousin or something.

1053
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.211
You don't know.
TALIESIN: I mean I don't

1054
00:47:16.211 --> 00:47:17.044
see the resemblance, but--
LAURA: He did have an accent

1055
00:47:17.044 --> 00:47:18.220
similar to yours.
SAM: He did!

1056
00:47:20.205 --> 00:47:23.140
TRAVIS: Uh huh, little bit of a difference.

1057
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:28.740
LAURA: Just in the height, but you looked pretty similar

1058
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:33.170
in the teeth, nope, your teeth are not, I don't

1059
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:36.088
it really didn't look alike, but you had similar accents.

1060
00:47:36.088 --> 00:47:37.413
TALIESIN: Find a tree in that hole.

1061
00:47:37.413 --> 00:47:39.163
SAM: The accent was a good tell.

1062
00:47:39.163 --> 00:47:41.516
Yeah, it's true.

1063
00:47:41.516 --> 00:47:43.900
ASHLEY: Who raised you then?

1064
00:47:45.424 --> 00:47:49.322
TRAVIS: The kids around me I guess, just learned

1065
00:47:49.322 --> 00:47:51.450
from being around other orphans.

1066
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:55.130
TALIESIN: Wow.

1067
00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:56.990
TRAVIS: Yeah, it wasn't a great place.

1068
00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:02.133
Driftwood Asylum was very--
LAURA: Asylum?

1069
00:48:02.133 --> 00:48:03.650
SAM: Like an orphanage?

1070
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:04.900
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Driftwood Asylum?

1071
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:08.140
SAM: I mean you didn't even have your muscles to protect you

1072
00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.952
so you had to rely on wits and cleverness.

1073
00:48:12.952 --> 00:48:14.520
TRAVIS: I mean to be fair I actually was a bit bigger

1074
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.650
than other kids when I was younger.

1075
00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.640
Half-orcs tend to grow a bit faster,

1076
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.320
but yeah, I just tend to get picked on a lot.

1077
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.720
I'm the only one of me around.

1078
00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.160
TALIESIN: Driftwood Asylum?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1079
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.876
TALIESIN: Someone named an orphanage

1080
00:48:27.876 --> 00:48:29.826
after wood that needs to be somewhere else

1081
00:48:29.826 --> 00:48:31.880
or really just wants to go somewhere else.

1082
00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.363
SAM: It's also wood that if you find it,

1083
00:48:34.363 --> 00:48:35.580
it's nice sometimes,

1084
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.670
you can make art out of it--
TRAVIS: I didn't say it was

1085
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:38.580
a great place.

1086
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.780
TALIESIN: Wow.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1087
00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:42.680
TALIESIN: You have layers.

1088
00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.670
I feel like I just learn something new everyday.

1089
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.100
Where to, captain?

1090
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:56.100
SAM: My husband has been walking around barefoot all day.

1091
00:48:56.308 --> 00:48:59.200
MATT: "To be fair, barefoot is a rather common way

1092
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.417
"that I walk around but where we come from

1093
00:49:01.417 --> 00:49:03.041
"it's generally a lot grassier."

1094
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:04.632
SAM: He's stepped on many, many rocks.

1095
00:49:04.632 --> 00:49:06.082
MATT: "Yeah, there's a lot of them."

1096
00:49:06.082 --> 00:49:07.405
ASHLEY: Let's get you some shoes.

1097
00:49:07.405 --> 00:49:09.100
I hate being barefoot.

1098
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.708
TALIESIN: Assuming a lot of this is rocks.

1099
00:49:10.708 --> 00:49:12.783
LAURA: Fjord, maybe your mom or your dad

1100
00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.930
was like a halfling or something.

1101
00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.850
SAM: The average.
LAURA: Yeah.

1102
00:49:19.493 --> 00:49:20.943
TRAVIS: (sighs) Oh boy.

1103
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:23.583
Do I--do we--do I know where the--

1104
00:49:23.583 --> 00:49:27.000
(laughter)

1105
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.790
Is it Morathka?

1106
00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:32.850
MATT: No, Borathkrah.

1107
00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:34.216
TRAVIS: What is it?

1108
00:49:34.216 --> 00:49:35.603
MATT: Boraftkra.

1109
00:49:35.603 --> 00:49:36.873
TRAVIS: I'll get the spelling later.

1110
00:49:36.873 --> 00:49:38.816
Do I know where that is?

1111
00:49:38.816 --> 00:49:41.930
In relation to the stuff that I know?

1112
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:45.910
MATT: Make a history check.

1113
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.615
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

1114
00:49:48.615 --> 00:49:50.165
SAM: Roll big, roll big.

1115
00:49:50.165 --> 00:49:51.540
TRAVIS: That's a six.

1116
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.655
MATT: Never heard of it.

1117
00:49:54.655 --> 00:49:56.810
TRAVIS: Too bad, would have been better.

1118
00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:58.551
TALIESIN: All right.

1119
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.380
MATT: All right, so where are you guys off to next?

1120
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.090
LAURA: We need to find a clothing store

1121
00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:04.570
and then we'll look for a jeweler

1122
00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:06.535
or someone that will sell jewels.

1123
00:50:06.535 --> 00:50:07.693
TALIESIN: Sundries and jewels.

1124
00:50:07.693 --> 00:50:08.926
MATT: Okay, cool.

1125
00:50:08.926 --> 00:50:11.119
While that's happening, I'm going to

1126
00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:12.120
jump over to these guys here.

1127
00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.278
SAM: Okay, Empire kids.

1128
00:50:14.278 --> 00:50:16.078
MATT: So Empire kids.

1129
00:50:16.078 --> 00:50:18.630
You end up traveling back to the Firmaments

1130
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:21.980
and heading to the Marble Tomes Conservatory,

1131
00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:26.973
which you had previously seen as you passed by. The

1132
00:50:26.973 --> 00:50:31.290
beautiful exterior of the various gray and marble stone

1133
00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:34.930
halls, the towers, and the central complex of

1134
00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:36.740
the building. As you approach, you can still see

1135
00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:40.655
the dull green, sometimes orange glows that

1136
00:50:40.655 --> 00:50:45.655
flicker and alternate in various areas of the interior.

1137
00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.810
As you approach, you do immediately notice

1138
00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.420
that there are a few of the Aurora Watch,

1139
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.760
the guards and soldiers of the Dynasty,

1140
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:58.643
keeping a fairly tight perimeter around the inner courtyard

1141
00:50:58.643 --> 00:51:02.123
and the approach to the central complex and building.

1142
00:51:02.123 --> 00:51:05.502
MARISHA: Let's watch for a second. Yeah.

1143
00:51:05.502 --> 00:51:08.060
We hang back and watch people come and go for a second.

1144
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:11.350
MATT: Okay. Not many initially seem to be coming and going.

1145
00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:13.343
It seems whoever's there is there.

1146
00:51:13.343 --> 00:51:17.660
Five minutes' wait and you do see two drow

1147
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.610
begin to round the corner. As they walk by,

1148
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:25.480
they both look at you guys and slow their gait

1149
00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.260
and inspect you very carefully and then continue walking.

1150
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.540
They make their way to the front and they both stop

1151
00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.870
one of the Aurora Watch begin talking to them.

1152
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:39.604
One of them looks back at you guys and they both enter.

1153
00:51:39.604 --> 00:51:42.170
That guard goes and grabs three other ones

1154
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.930
and now four Aurora Watch begin to walk towards you.

1155
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.680
MARISHA: Did they show any type of credentials

1156
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.946
or do anything when they went in?

1157
00:51:47.946 --> 00:51:49.396
MATT: Nope.

1158
00:51:49.396 --> 00:51:52.280
LIAM: Well, I'm pulling mine out from my cloak

1159
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.750
and I'm just waiting holding it up like my driver's license.

1160
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:58.980
MARISHA: Well, let's just go up and let's just act confident

1161
00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.988
and talk to them.

1162
00:51:59.988 --> 00:52:02.455
LIAM: I'm very confident with this. Let's go talk.

1163
00:52:02.455 --> 00:52:03.955
MARISHA: Yeah.

1164
00:52:03.955 --> 00:52:06.150
MATT: All right, so you guys begin to meet them part way.

1165
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:08.283
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. In that way when

1166
00:52:08.283 --> 00:52:11.948
you know a cop is walking towards you and you're like,

1167
00:52:11.948 --> 00:52:15.224
I'm going to show that this is--

1168
00:52:15.224 --> 00:52:17.590
MATT: Show that?
MARISHA: That I'm cool.

1169
00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:19.239
MATT: Okay, okay.

1170
00:52:19.239 --> 00:52:22.819
TRAVIS: I'm excited to learn.

1171
00:52:22.819 --> 00:52:24.680
SAM: When a cop walks towards you.

1172
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.910
TALIESIN: I know where you're coming from.

1173
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.270
MARISHA: I've nothing to hide.

1174
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:31.378
It's my, "I have nothing to hide" walk.

1175
00:52:31.378 --> 00:52:34.537
MATT: Nothing to hide walk, all right.

1176
00:52:34.537 --> 00:52:37.390
As you begin to meet them part way,

1177
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:40.890
the guards put their hands on the side

1178
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:43.848
of where their blades are sheathed.

1179
00:52:43.848 --> 00:52:46.060
The one that was originally approached

1180
00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.550
puts a hand up and tells you to stop

1181
00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:52.550
and goes, "Hail, what is your business?"

1182
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.130
LIAM: <i>Ja, hallo</i>. I understand this must be

1183
00:52:56.130 --> 00:53:00.160
a very rare sight in this neck of the woods.

1184
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.900
Strange as it may seem, we are very welcome guests

1185
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:08.540
of the Umavi herself. That can be checked out, of course.

1186
00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.750
MATT: "Step forward and let me see."

1187
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.614
Goes and takes it.

1188
00:53:13.614 --> 00:53:15.955
LIAM: That's a loaner.

1189
00:53:15.955 --> 00:53:17.547
MARISHA: We're just here to do

1190
00:53:17.547 --> 00:53:20.916
a little research by request of the queen.

1191
00:53:20.916 --> 00:53:22.805
LIAM: We are here to see a Professor Waccoh

1192
00:53:22.805 --> 00:53:24.796
and to peruse the stacks.

1193
00:53:24.796 --> 00:53:26.279
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1194
00:53:26.279 --> 00:53:28.230
MARISHA: With like assistance, or each, or?

1195
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:29.188
MATT: You're both talking,

1196
00:53:29.188 --> 00:53:32.255
so you could either both roll it. Go for it.

1197
00:53:32.255 --> 00:53:35.130
He's looking over it.

1198
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:39.510
LIAM: 22.
MARISHA: Six.

1199
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:42.070
MATT: They're not buying what you're offering,

1200
00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:43.900
but you manage to smooth it over.

1201
00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.469
They look confused, but they can't really refute

1202
00:53:46.469 --> 00:53:50.095
the symbols you guys carry. Hands it back over.

1203
00:53:50.095 --> 00:53:54.579
"All right, well, welcome to

1204
00:53:54.579 --> 00:53:57.070
the Marble Tomes Conservatory."

1205
00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:59.850
LIAM: Thank you, and I can see that this makes you

1206
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:03.270
slightly nervous, I encourage you to do your homework.

1207
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:07.360
Go check it out. This is for real.

1208
00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:11.530
MATT: "Well, I will have to escort you within.

1209
00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:15.050
"So do please walk ahead of me.

1210
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:18.992
"I will guide your path to the professor."

1211
00:54:18.992 --> 00:54:22.410
LIAM: <i>Danke schön.</i> And we follow.

1212
00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:24.900
TRAVIS: Y'all are going to get killed.

1213
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.990
MATT: You guys walk towards the front.

1214
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:32.990
There are about 40 shallow steps that lead towards the front

1215
00:54:32.998 --> 00:54:34.940
of this main conservatory entrance.

1216
00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:38.260
You can see that it's double doors,

1217
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.933
which are open currently, these very heavy

1218
00:54:40.933 --> 00:54:45.480
10-foot-tall stone doorway doors that are pushed outward.

1219
00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.420
You can see on the outskirts some of these beautiful

1220
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.330
carvings of some sort of design. You can't really see

1221
00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.210
from this angle based on when they're open,

1222
00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:55.290
but as you enter the main area, your footfalls

1223
00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:59.090
hit the smooth marble floors,

1224
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:03.090
echo in the interior. It's a very warm, welcoming space

1225
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:06.410
in the inside. High ceilings, domed.

1226
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:08.590
There is a central chandelier

1227
00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:11.650
arrangement that is dangling from the top of the

1228
00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:14.146
25-foot-high domed ceiling that is

1229
00:55:14.146 --> 00:55:17.930
a circle of the same similar green baubles

1230
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:19.270
that you see glowing within the lanterns

1231
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:21.300
throughout the city, but they are arranged

1232
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.370
in a circle. In the center, there is one

1233
00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:25.960
that is designed to look like a beacon,

1234
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.220
but is green and glowing from the inside.

1235
00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.180
It's interesting, the green light here

1236
00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.570
is not a sickly green, it's a warm green.

1237
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.387
It's hard to describe.

1238
00:55:36.387 --> 00:55:39.030
The nuances in the color doesn't set you off

1239
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.210
like a lot of green coloration would.

1240
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:42.800
As you enter the main chamber,

1241
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.800
there is a semi-circle desk. There is a dark elf woman there

1242
00:55:48.738 --> 00:55:53.080
in robes who is eyes closed currently,

1243
00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:56.350
meditating or quietly thinking, you're uncertain.

1244
00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:57.870
Eyes open, looks forward.

1245
00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:02.470
Her hair is pulled back and bunned tightly.

1246
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:05.510
She looks forward confused and the Aurora Watch guard behind

1247
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:10.510
puts a hand up. "They are guests of the Bright Queen.

1248
00:56:10.992 --> 00:56:15.467
"They are looking for the professor. I am to escort them."

1249
00:56:15.467 --> 00:56:18.255
She nods.

1250
00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:20.560
You guys don't see her lips move,

1251
00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.110
but you hear a voice in your head go,

1252
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:25.870
"Well then, continue."

1253
00:56:27.077 --> 00:56:30.957
(pats loudly)

1254
00:56:30.957 --> 00:56:34.410
LAURA: Ow, that was a hard hit.

1255
00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:37.581
SAM: She digs it.

1256
00:56:37.581 --> 00:56:39.273
LIAM: Caleb strides ahead.

1257
00:56:39.273 --> 00:56:41.815
TRAVIS: (vibrating low pitch)

1258
00:56:42.924 --> 00:56:45.490
MATT: The one guard is with you.

1259
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:49.435
There's a secondary guard who's behind you guys.

1260
00:56:49.435 --> 00:56:51.105
The other one has moved up alongside you

1261
00:56:51.105 --> 00:56:53.240
and a little bit ahead to guide you through

1262
00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.390
the area that you're not familiar with.

1263
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:58.720
Towards the left hallway you continue through this bit

1264
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.310
that goes back out through the courtyard.

1265
00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:04.890
It's a long, maybe 80-foot hallway.

1266
00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:07.508
It's about 10 feet across, 20 feet high

1267
00:57:07.508 --> 00:57:11.500
and it's got some beautiful paintings

1268
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:15.450
mural work on the walls, but the center, about eye level

1269
00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:20.443
for about five feet or so, is just open glass.

1270
00:57:20.443 --> 00:57:22.713
You can see out into the courtyard around you

1271
00:57:22.713 --> 00:57:24.238
and it's like walking into a hall

1272
00:57:24.238 --> 00:57:27.317
that's in the middle of a beautiful garden under darkness.

1273
00:57:27.317 --> 00:57:29.508
MATT: As you're brought to the end of this hallway,

1274
00:57:29.508 --> 00:57:31.120
there's a spiral staircase

1275
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.480
to your right and a double door ahead of you.

1276
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.330
The guard brings you to the spiral staircase

1277
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:37.450
and leads you up to the interior

1278
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:40.760
of some sort of tower or another smaller building

1279
00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.600
beyond the central chamber that you were led to

1280
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:46.099
here in the Marbles Tomes. You get up to the second floor

1281
00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:50.610
and this one section has three doors.

1282
00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:53.380
The one to the left of you is open

1283
00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.150
and the smell gets you. When you come inside,

1284
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:59.522
it has this very nice, soft, incense-type smell

1285
00:57:59.522 --> 00:58:04.190
like a jasmine or lavender, very subtle.

1286
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:06.390
On the secondary floor, the smells that get to you

1287
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:08.630
are immediately more pungent.

1288
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:12.988
They are citrus-y and metallic

1289
00:58:12.988 --> 00:58:16.202
and carbon burned,

1290
00:58:16.202 --> 00:58:19.890
a whole mixture and they seem to shift by the moment.

1291
00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:23.100
You hear some shuffling around and the guard leads you

1292
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.180
to this open doorway.

1293
00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:29.300
"Professor, you have guests who have arrived

1294
00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.916
"looking for you.

1295
00:58:32.916 --> 00:58:37.691
"Just as a note, they are human,

1296
00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:41.700
"but they have credentials, so we will be

1297
00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:44.670
"outside if you need us."

1298
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:48.372
This voice goes, "Okay.

1299
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:55.260
"So let them in."

1300
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.880
The guard steps aside and gestures to both of you

1301
00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.205
to enter the chamber.

1302
00:58:59.205 --> 00:59:01.796
MARISHA: Do you want to--should I go first?

1303
00:59:01.796 --> 00:59:05.666
LIAM: I walk into the room. Hello!

1304
00:59:05.666 --> 00:59:07.490
MATT: You step aside. It's this beautiful

1305
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:12.150
oval-shaped den or a study.

1306
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:15.270
There are some shelves with books around it.

1307
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:17.460
There are other shelves that have

1308
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.680
numerous glass containers that are connected

1309
00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.670
to other tubes and other glass containers

1310
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:26.627
and coils of various brass-colored metals and small burners.

1311
00:59:26.627 --> 00:59:30.236
There is a large circle on the opposite end

1312
00:59:30.236 --> 00:59:32.027
that is drawn on the floor

1313
00:59:32.027 --> 00:59:34.090
that has different gems on pedestals,

1314
00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:36.330
different heights around it.

1315
00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:39.750
You can see little pieces of paper like scrawled notes

1316
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:41.690
that are just left everywhere.

1317
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:44.350
It is in disarray. It's beautiful,

1318
00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:49.010
but a complete scattered sense that

1319
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:52.490
this once beautiful chamber was well organized

1320
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:56.126
and somebody came in and tore it apart.

1321
00:59:56.126 --> 00:59:59.360
Immediately as you step into this and look,

1322
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.260
the smells you were getting are much stronger

1323
01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.510
and immediately your nose crinkles back.

1324
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:06.664
The burning, you can feel your nose hairs

1325
01:00:06.664 --> 01:00:11.265
singeing slightly from whatever thick air

1326
01:00:11.265 --> 01:00:16.265
or gaseous material is dissipating throughout the chamber.

1327
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:21.120
You see turn around as you say hello,

1328
01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.119
a female orc: middle-aged,

1329
01:00:28.145 --> 01:00:33.090
rotund, in robes and a heavy shawl on,

1330
01:00:33.948 --> 01:00:37.598
crazy wild lion mane of hair

1331
01:00:37.598 --> 01:00:39.350
that goes and covers most of her face,

1332
01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:41.120
they get in front of her eyes.

1333
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.870
She has some sort of long eye piece

1334
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.779
like an eye patch, but it's a long tube

1335
01:00:47.779 --> 01:00:51.930
with a reddish orange glass on the tip.

1336
01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:57.930
Her jaw is a little bit forward set

1337
01:00:57.930 --> 01:01:00.840
and you can see one heavy tusk that seems to have

1338
01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.210
curled up and at least pushed or pierced part of the

1339
01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:06.880
upper lip where now the skin is pushed in.

1340
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.954
Turns around and looks at you.

1341
01:01:10.954 --> 01:01:13.288
The one eye here and lifts up

1342
01:01:13.288 --> 01:01:14.960
the other piece and it slips down a bit

1343
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.840
and she has to readjust it and it slips down a bit

1344
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.090
and she takes it off and sets it on the desk nearby.

1345
01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:22.830
A bunch of papers (blows) to the ground as she does that.

1346
01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:27.830
She turns back. "I'm so sorry, so sorry. So, um--

1347
01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.315
"Hi, what's going on?"

1348
01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:35.960
You've--ah, hi.

1349
01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.650
LIAM: Undoubtedly strange of course. What are we doing here?

1350
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:42.318
MATT: "A bit, a bit. Yeah, wow. No, step forward please,

1351
01:01:42.318 --> 01:01:46.034
"I've not really had a chance to--

1352
01:01:47.976 --> 01:01:49.023
"Okay, okay."

1353
01:01:49.023 --> 01:01:50.580
MARISHA: Do you want to get it? Yeah.

1354
01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.358
MATT: She leans forward and takes your chin

1355
01:01:52.358 --> 01:01:54.560
and is looking--like inspecting a horse

1356
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.200
you're about to purchase, opening your mouth

1357
01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.580
and looking at your teeth and your ears

1358
01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.420
and is like, "Fascinating."

1359
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.267
LIAM: Gentle, sometimes she does bite.

1360
01:02:02.267 --> 01:02:03.608
MARISHA: (clicks teeth)

1361
01:02:03.608 --> 01:02:05.575
LAURA: Ah, I hate that sound.

1362
01:02:07.406 --> 01:02:08.628
LIAM: I like it.

1363
01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:12.400
MATT: Lifts your arm and moves the wrists.

1364
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.531
MARISHA: I flex a little.
MATT: "Oh! (laughs)

1365
01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:17.260
"They come so taut.

1366
01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.209
"I didn't know that, all right, all right, okay."

1367
01:02:19.209 --> 01:02:20.600
LIAM: Thin, but ropey.

1368
01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.034
MARISHA: I like to keep it tight.

1369
01:02:22.034 --> 01:02:24.475
MATT: "Interesting, okay.

1370
01:02:24.475 --> 01:02:26.900
"And what age would you put yourself at?"

1371
01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.640
MARISHA: Oh, I'm 24.

1372
01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.220
MATT: "All right, okay, so still in the prime. You are?"

1373
01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.800
LIAM: I have no such muscles.

1374
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.633
I do not bite.

1375
01:02:35.633 --> 01:02:38.037
MATT: Go and grabs your chin, lifts up a bit.

1376
01:02:38.037 --> 01:02:41.328
"Okay, yes, hygiene's an issue--"

1377
01:02:41.328 --> 01:02:44.128
Not that I mind horribly,

1378
01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:46.620
but is there a specific point to this?

1379
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.290
MARISHA: Just let it happen.
MATT: "Curiosity."

1380
01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:53.010
Looks inside the jacket a bit

1381
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:55.090
and says, "Oh, what are these?" and grabs

1382
01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:56.995
one of the tomes in the pocket.

1383
01:02:56.995 --> 01:02:59.610
LIAM: Oh, here, look at this one.

1384
01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.010
I pull out my spell book and hand it over.

1385
01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:04.660
This one's a little more private.

1386
01:03:06.353 --> 01:03:08.383
MATT: "Interesting.

1387
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:14.390
"Huh. (laughs) Practicer the arcane or just a hobbyist?"

1388
01:03:14.608 --> 01:03:17.257
LIAM: A little bit of both.
MATT: "Interesting."

1389
01:03:17.257 --> 01:03:20.050
LIAM: In fact, hoping to possibly--it's not our main purpose

1390
01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:22.840
for being here today--but further the hobby.

1391
01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.573
Always, everyday, hoping to further the hobby.

1392
01:03:25.573 --> 01:03:26.790
MATT: "Interesting.

1393
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:30.360
"Now, ah--I'm sorry, you were here

1394
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.640
"looking for the professor, right?

1395
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.520
MARISHA: Is that you?
LIAM: Are you not she?

1396
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.680
MATT: I am the professor, I hadn't introduced myself yet,

1397
01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.830
I thought it was important that I cross that threshold

1398
01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:43.104
as you're a guest in my chamber here, so.

1399
01:03:43.104 --> 01:03:44.790
MARISHA: Sort of put two and two together.

1400
01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:48.060
MATT: "Fair enough. I am Professor Tuss Waccoh."

1401
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:50.400
LIAM: Tusk Waccoh?
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

1402
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:56.720
"I've been one of the top researchers

1403
01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:01.330
"specifically in development of engineering

1404
01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:04.250
"and most recently one of the head designers

1405
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:06.720
"of the conflict's war machines."

1406
01:04:08.557 --> 01:04:09.390
LIAM: Oh.

1407
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:11.850
MATT: "So, I'm real curious

1408
01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:13.847
"what a couple of humans are doing here

1409
01:04:13.847 --> 01:04:15.672
"in the center of the Dynasty.

1410
01:04:15.672 --> 01:04:17.640
"Where are you both from

1411
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.330
"and what are you doing here?"

1412
01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:20.580
LIAM: That is the question isn't it?

1413
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.140
MATT: "Yeah, it's a very unique question that I'd like

1414
01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.633
"you both to answer very honestly."

1415
01:04:26.633 --> 01:04:28.374
MARISHA: Have any weapons on you?

1416
01:04:28.374 --> 01:04:30.724
You going to slit our throats? You want us dead?

1417
01:04:30.724 --> 01:04:32.130
MATT: "No."

1418
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.655
LIAM: That's not going to happen

1419
01:04:33.655 --> 01:04:35.254
because we have these, of course.

1420
01:04:35.254 --> 01:04:38.232
But I understand the question and I am happy to accommodate.

1421
01:04:38.232 --> 01:04:41.125
MATT: "Right, yes the umavi. Yeah, no, that's great,

1422
01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:43.920
"that's wonderful. But seriously, answer my question.

1423
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.672
MARISHA: We're from the Empire.

1424
01:04:45.672 --> 01:04:47.632
LIAM: We're from the heart of the Empire.

1425
01:04:47.632 --> 01:04:48.760
Isn't that weird?

1426
01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.704
MATT: "That's very strange, yeah, very.

1427
01:04:51.704 --> 01:04:53.787
MARISHA: You can say we're...

1428
01:04:54.704 --> 01:04:57.680
dynasty enthusiasts.

1429
01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.347
MATT: "Oh, dabbling, you've come to dabble in the Dynasty?"

1430
01:05:02.347 --> 01:05:04.511
MARISHA: Yeah. We like walking lines

1431
01:05:04.511 --> 01:05:06.627
and sometimes crossing them.

1432
01:05:06.627 --> 01:05:07.460
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1433
01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.326
MATT: "Love lost with the Dynasty?

1434
01:05:09.326 --> 01:05:11.230
"You've given up? Are you defectors, are you--?"

1435
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:13.180
LIAM: Have we given up on the empire?

1436
01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:14.447
MATT: "Yes, yes."

1437
01:05:14.447 --> 01:05:17.255
MARISHA: We're here to maybe gain

1438
01:05:17.255 --> 01:05:19.150
a little bit more favor of the Bright Queen.

1439
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:24.150
I think she might want to utilize us as her own war machines

1440
01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:27.670
if you get what I'm saying.
MATT: "Oh double agent, huh."

1441
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.980
MARISHA: You don't have to say it out loud,

1442
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.080
it's super--
MATT: "No, that's exactly

1443
01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.520
"what a double agent for the empire would do as well,

1444
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.170
"so I'm just curious. Just checking all the boxes,

1445
01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:40.420
"looking for all the angles, I've been here for a while

1446
01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:43.350
"and I've gotten where I am today by being very curious,

1447
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:46.020
"so I'm very curious. That's why I'm asking questions."

1448
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:48.760
LIAM: Are you familiar with any of the people

1449
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.210
who hang with the Bright Queen in her chambers?

1450
01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:54.350
MATT: "I know of the Dens, yeah. No, I don't belong to them,

1451
01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.362
"but I'm important. I do good work for them,

1452
01:05:56.362 --> 01:05:58.402
"so let me do my thing.
LIAM: Understood.

1453
01:06:01.469 --> 01:06:04.205
MARISHA: I like your curiosity. We're curious as well.

1454
01:06:04.205 --> 01:06:05.813
MATT: "I can imagine. To come all this way,

1455
01:06:05.813 --> 01:06:07.130
"after being with the Empire.

1456
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.640
"That's a lot, some strong curiosity, it's very dangerous."

1457
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.270
LIAM: Well, we are not entirely--

1458
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:15.332
MATT: "Would you like something to drink?"

1459
01:06:15.332 --> 01:06:17.202
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: "Me too."

1460
01:06:17.202 --> 01:06:19.560
She walks over and opens up this cabinet

1461
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.350
and you can see there's a bunch of dark glass bottles

1462
01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:25.670
and pulls one out, a couple of glasses and seems to be

1463
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:29.320
some sort of brackish liquor and pours in a few glasses

1464
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.737
and sets it over.

1465
01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:34.342
"Here, here. To new curiosities.

1466
01:06:34.342 --> 01:06:35.433
(laughs)

1467
01:06:37.676 --> 01:06:40.590
LIAM: I don't drink it.
MARISHA: I drink it.

1468
01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:44.520
MATT: Strong, but nice. Smooth. Burns a little.

1469
01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:48.408
Puts it down. "Ha ha, so. (sniffs)"

1470
01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.840
LIAM: Yeah, our allegiances are a little fluid, it's true.

1471
01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.000
MATT: "Okay, so, you're looking for me?"

1472
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.550
LIAM: Well, we're looking for a couple of things.

1473
01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:02.830
One, the Bright Queen herself asked that we see you,

1474
01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:05.340
we understand that you are looking for a little bit of--

1475
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.760
MARISHA: Assistance.
LIAM: Muscle.

1476
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.410
MATT: "Oh yeah, yeah I guess I do, mm."

1477
01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:14.171
MARISHA: Is it personal?

1478
01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:19.090
MATT: "There are layers, there are layers involved.

1479
01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:20.590
"Nothing you need to worry about."

1480
01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:23.070
MARISHA: Well, you can be honest with us, Waccoh.

1481
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:28.410
MATT: "Okay, if you're looking for work, if you're looking

1482
01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:32.170
"for things to be useful, maybe there's money to be had

1483
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:34.720
"and I could write you some more favorable things

1484
01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.190
"because this job would really be of great service

1485
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:40.803
"to what we're doing against the empire.

1486
01:07:40.803 --> 01:07:44.250
"This would be a great way to show your support."

1487
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.860
LIAM: That's what we are attempting to do, and trying

1488
01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:51.260
to learn a bit about our new digs, I suppose.

1489
01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:54.640
MATT: "Great, great, great great. Okay.

1490
01:07:56.030 --> 01:08:01.030
"So, I've been designing a couple new--

1491
01:08:01.239 --> 01:08:06.238
--some fun weapons of fairly intense destruction.

1492
01:08:07.696 --> 01:08:10.860
"So the last batch went out

1493
01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:13.800
"heading westward and we were going to this new design

1494
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.610
"over at the steelworks, not far from here

1495
01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:17.914
"up in the northeast where the Vermaloc

1496
01:08:17.914 --> 01:08:20.005
"meets the Penumbra Range.

"So there's a place called

"the Deepriver Mining Camp that's part of

1499
01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.940
"the Steelworks--the Steelworks were built around that

1500
01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:32.080
"actually when the war began, it's a long story."

1501
01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.084
LIAM: What's the name again?

1502
01:08:34.084 --> 01:08:36.210
MATT: "The Deepriver Mining Camp and it's the

"where I'm going to be needing some help

"up there. There's--

1506
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:47.140
"It's been on lockdown.

1507
01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.690
"A troop of these giants stormed in and smashed up the place

1508
01:08:50.690 --> 01:08:52.680
"and killed a bunch of our people

1509
01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.050
"and most of them had to flee to the east

1510
01:08:55.050 --> 01:08:57.316
"outside of the Vermaloc.

1511
01:08:57.316 --> 01:08:59.369
"And they're just in a holding pattern."

1512
01:08:59.369 --> 01:09:02.170
LIAM: Common or expected--
MATT: "No, it's the first time

"it's ever happened, things have been great,

01:09:03.936 --> 01:09:06.186
"this doesn't make any sense why they would do this.

1515
01:09:06.186 --> 01:09:07.470
"The giants live up in the mountains,

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:09.245
"I don't know why they're sitting pretty in the forest,

"sitting right squat in the middle of the work

"that I need them to finish so--

1519
01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:19.537
"They thankfully had already moved the last batch

1520
01:09:19.537 --> 01:09:22.580
"and the last war body out, so at least the bloodshed

1521
01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.170
"was minimal and we didn't lose too much of my work.

1522
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:26.553
"So that was good."

1523
01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:29.035
LIAM: What is the nature of these war machines?

1524
01:09:29.035 --> 01:09:31.026
MATT: "That's nothing for you to worry about,

1525
01:09:31.026 --> 01:09:34.170
just say they're very useful.

1526
01:09:36.578 --> 01:09:41.500
"The mine that's attached is a vast iron bearing mine,

1527
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.760
"but also copper, which is pretty rare in these parts

1528
01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.760
"and essential to a lot of my designs.

"So now that that's come to an end, that's problematic.

"There's also the foreman, Bodo.

1531
01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:58.390
"He's a right prick."

01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:01.312
MARISHA: The foreman who?
MATT: "The foreman, Bodo.

1533

"He runs the Steelworks there.

"We work together because we have to,

"I'm sure he's doing his best to try and get this

"and two, last thing I want is for him to pull this off.

"So if you're looking for work I would love--

"Just the two of you?"
LIAM: No.

1541
01:10:31.066 --> 01:10:33.060
MARISHA: We've got friends.
LIAM: Big friends.

1542
01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.110
MARISHA: High places.
LIAM: Strong friends.

1543
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.480
MATT: "Go and take down some giants friends?"

1544
01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.138
LIAM: Definitely.

1545
01:10:39.138 --> 01:10:43.985
MATT: "Okay." She gets in real close again and looks at you.

1546
01:10:43.985 --> 01:10:46.752
MARISHA: I lift up my abs, Jersey Shore style.

1547
01:10:46.752 --> 01:10:49.669
(laughter)

1548
01:10:50.817 --> 01:10:52.925
MATT: "All right, all right, all right,

1549
01:10:52.925 --> 01:10:55.175
"yeah, all right, all right.

1550
01:10:56.308 --> 01:10:58.880
"So you've got friends you got giant-killing friends, great.

1551
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.880
"Okay. So I need you guys to take your friends.

1552
01:11:04.796 --> 01:11:09.204
"I need you to go these steelworks, maybe go

1553
01:11:09.204 --> 01:11:12.490
"talk to whoever's still around. They probably

1554
01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:15.600
"have an encampment outside of the Vermaloc

1555
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.570
"not far from there. And just whatever you do

1556
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.730
"tell that foreman to fuck off,

1557
01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:26.435
"get the work done and allow us all

1558
01:11:26.435 --> 01:11:28.460
"the capabilities to gloat

1559
01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.710
"that we succeeded where he failed."

1560
01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:34.243
LIAM: Understood, that sounds very doable.

1561
01:11:34.243 --> 01:11:35.732
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: "Great, wonderful."

1562
01:11:35.732 --> 01:11:37.900
MARISHA: You're a woman who likes coming out on top?

1563
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.830
MATT: "Oh, always, it's where--"

1564
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:41.940
MARISHA: Why does this foreman not want to work with you?

1565
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.732
Is he not--?
MATT: "No, we work together."

1566
01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:44.720
MARISHA: Oh okay.

1567
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:48.700
Is he not sympathetic towards the war effort?

1568
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.241
MATT: "Oh, we're both working for the war--

1569
01:11:50.241 --> 01:11:51.824
"look, you can still work together

1570
01:11:51.824 --> 01:11:54.344
"and still find them a fucking asshole, right?"

1571
01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.660
MARISHA: Isn't that the fucking truth?

1572
01:11:55.660 --> 01:12:00.460
MATT: "Exactly, exactly, it's just--consider it a little

1573
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:06.860
"business competition. Sure, he can build stuff.

1574
01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.660
"I design it. Who's better, right, huh?"

1575
01:12:10.317 --> 01:12:14.975
MARISHA: Well, I don't want to

1576
01:12:14.975 --> 01:12:16.658
overstep my bounds,

1577
01:12:16.658 --> 01:12:19.349
but, I mean, feels like you need someone to

1578
01:12:19.349 --> 01:12:20.182
build it for you.

1579
01:12:20.182 --> 01:12:21.857
MATT: "I need it, but could he build it

1580
01:12:21.857 --> 01:12:23.340
"if I didn't design it? No."

1581
01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.090
MARISHA: No, but see, you guys, it's a cycle.

1582
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:29.250
You lean on each--it's fine. We'll go kill your giants.

1583
01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.400
LIAM: Yeah, you know your business better than we do.

1584
01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.560
I would rather speak about recompense if

1585
01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.743
that is all right with you.

1586
01:12:34.743 --> 01:12:35.809
MATT: "Oh yes, of course, of course.

1587
01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:37.190
"I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1588
01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:41.202
"Okay (excited sounds)."

1589
01:12:41.202 --> 01:12:43.330
She turns around. There's a chest on the side

1590
01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:47.235
and she gets down below and-- "Turn around."

1591
01:12:47.235 --> 01:12:48.368
LIAM: Turn around.

1592
01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:52.120
MATT: You hear some rustling,

1593
01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.304
couple of footsteps over somewhere, something falls.

1594
01:12:54.304 --> 01:12:55.503
(crash sound) "Oh shit."

1595
01:12:55.503 --> 01:12:57.255
MARISHA: I peek over my shoulder.

1596
01:12:57.255 --> 01:12:58.838
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

1597
01:12:58.838 --> 01:13:00.671
MARISHA: Okay.

1598
01:13:04.197 --> 01:13:06.230
That's not good. That's not good across the board. Ten.

1599
01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:09.700
MATT: You manage to glance over and you unfortunately

1600
01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.200
missed most of what happened. All you see is her

1601
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.660
returning to the chest with a small set of keys.

1602
01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.130
She unlocks it,

1603
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.660
opens it up, starts pulling things out.

1604
01:13:20.514 --> 01:13:22.650
"(muttering)" Starts pulling out small boxes,

1605
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:23.610
pulls out a--
LIAM: Are you emptying a Bag

1606
01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:26.310
of Holding over there? What is happening?

1607
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.380
MATT: "I'm pulling out some things that might be useful

1608
01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:34.040
for a couple of ex-empire kids that like to go kill giants

1609
01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.180
and shit." And you hear (ping ping). There's a couple of

1610
01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:41.330
things on the ground, a scattering of knickknacks

1611
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:42.858
and she pulls out a few things.

1612
01:13:42.858 --> 01:13:46.270
"All right, we got, uh--let me see."

1613
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:48.600
She dumps out a bag on the table

1614
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.540
and a bunch of gems just scatter out in a pile:

1615
01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:56.570
sapphires, emeralds, rubies. All sorts of precious gems

1616
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:59.302
some rough, some well cut. It's just--

1617
01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:02.410
and she looks at you and she grabs that eye piece

1618
01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:06.980
and puts it on again and in a matter of seconds

1619
01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:09.030
seems to do counting in her head, puts both hands down

1620
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:14.030
and scoops half of it into her bag and grabs two more.

1621
01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:18.100
"All right, 6,650 gold--

1622
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.475
"Sorry, 8,650 gold worth of gems."

1623
01:14:21.475 --> 01:14:25.450
Pulls it taut on the table, puts the rest over into

1624
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:28.060
a little satchel and throws it back into the side there.

1625
01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.420
It scoots next to the other pile of knickknacks.

1626
01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:34.300
"Or you can grab a couple of

1627
01:14:35.425 --> 01:14:37.260
"these interesting fine things."

1628
01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.400
LIAM: And they would be?
MARISHA: Yeah.

1629
01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.830
MATT: "I know a few of them. I just collect things."

1630
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:47.190
MARISHA: Are they items--are they magical items?

1631
01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:51.394
MATT: Make a perception check.
MARISHA: Okay.

1632
01:14:51.394 --> 01:14:53.927
TRAVIS: Roll high.

1633
01:14:53.927 --> 01:14:57.126
MARISHA: Fucking bullshit.

1634
01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:58.320
12.

1635
01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.153
MATT: Okay.

1636
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.900
You can see there's a couple of (laughs)

1637
01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:07.433
broken idols made of stone.

1638
01:15:08.454 --> 01:15:10.837
A lot of it is just general

1639
01:15:10.837 --> 01:15:15.160
knickknacks and shit, but in the mix there

1640
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.300
she walks over and starts pulling some things out.

1641
01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.670
She picks up one of the boxes and opens it and,

1642
01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:22.230
"Ah, there's a little ring here.

1643
01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:25.410
"I've been told this is quite potent."

1644
01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.029
She sets it aside and she goes and takes--

1645
01:15:29.029 --> 01:15:30.812
it's like a broken side sword blade.

1646
01:15:30.812 --> 01:15:34.410
She goes and grabs a little bauble and rolls it off.

1647
01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.480
She goes and grabs a thick bundle of cloth

1648
01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.140
and goes, "Ah, ah, ah this," and you can see

1649
01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:46.440
this dark brown globe with red and gold trim.

1650
01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.598
"This also. I'll have to go ahead and

1651
01:15:49.598 --> 01:15:50.622
"recheck to see what this does

1652
01:15:50.622 --> 01:15:53.590
"but it's supposedly enchanted. Useful." Sets it up

1653
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:55.234
on the table.
LIAM: Mind if I check these?

1654
01:15:55.234 --> 01:15:57.040
MATT: "Oh yeah, yeah, you can do that, but I should probably

1655
01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:57.873
"check, too, so we can both be

1656
01:15:57.873 --> 01:15:59.230
"on the same page right, right?"

1657
01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:00.818
LIAM: Sure.

1658
01:16:00.818 --> 01:16:02.500
MATT: She takes her little thing down the eyepiece.

1659
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:03.740
LIAM: I cast Detect Magic.

1660
01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:08.636
MATT: The ring, the robe both give off a magical pattern.

1661
01:16:08.636 --> 01:16:13.016
TRAVIS: How about the broken sword blade?

1662
01:16:13.016 --> 01:16:14.266
MATT: A very, very faint

1663
01:16:14.266 --> 01:16:18.317
magical essence in the broken sword blade.

1664
01:16:18.317 --> 01:16:20.167
There is also a staff,

1665
01:16:20.167 --> 01:16:24.417
a twisting staff that spirals

1666
01:16:24.417 --> 01:16:26.760
and at the end of it it looks like it's a grasping hand

1667
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:30.823
the fingers clawed inward, but it's all wood.

1668
01:16:30.823 --> 01:16:33.420
That gives off a strong magical aura as well.

1669
01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:37.870
LIAM: So ring, staff, faint on the broken sword, and a robe.

1670
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:40.390
MATT: Yes. As she pulls her eye piece down,

1671
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:42.830
she focuses for a second and you see this little flash

1672
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:45.510
of orange light in the middle of it

1673
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:48.320
and she glances back and she goes, "Right, all right

1674
01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.320
"so this ring. It's a Ring of Evasion.

1675
01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.700
"It helps you avoid dangerous things if perhaps

1676
01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.525
"you weren't as nimble to get out

1677
01:16:59.525 --> 01:17:01.975
"of the way in time. (laughs)

1678
01:17:01.975 --> 01:17:06.975
"That's useful. This is a Robe of Far Patterns.

1679
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:10.520
"If it's initiated, one it helps defend yourself

1680
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:14.590
"a little bit more, withstands the blows and cuts

1681
01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:16.400
"that you might come upon your journeys

1682
01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.350
"in these dangerous lands, but also on the inside,

1683
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:21.850
"a little peak, a little peak," and she opens up the robe.

1684
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:24.298
"Oh it's just cloth, I guess you have to initiate it,

1685
01:17:24.298 --> 01:17:25.980
"but I guess if someone gets in your way,

1686
01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.340
"you can give them a little glimpse of places

1687
01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:32.630
"far and dark and might spook their brain a bit."

1688
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:33.478
MARISHA: Nice.

1689
01:17:33.478 --> 01:17:34.394
MATT: "Now you're obviously not supposed

1690
01:17:34.394 --> 01:17:35.994
"to have all that fun stuff.

1691
01:17:35.994 --> 01:17:37.752
"You'll know all about that eventually,

1692
01:17:37.752 --> 01:17:39.752
"won't you, wizard boy?

1693
01:17:43.328 --> 01:17:47.500
"This staff here (grunts). "This is a Staff of Withering.

1694
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.080
"This thing's pretty fun.

1695
01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.084
"It can hit something and, if initiated,

1696
01:17:54.084 --> 01:17:56.380
ooh, it can suck some of that life out of

1697
01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.027
the thing it hits. It's great."

1698
01:17:59.027 --> 01:18:01.347
MARISHA and LAURA: (laughs)

1699
01:18:01.347 --> 01:18:02.730
LIAM: Did you cover the ring. I can't remember.

1700
01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:04.690
MARISHA: The ring was evasion.
LIAM: The ring was evasion.

1701
01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:06.630
LIAM: So the ring, robe--
MARISHA: Broken sword blade.

1702
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:07.890
LIAM: Broken sword.
MARISHA: We don't know yet.

1703
01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:09.710
LIAM: We don't know.

1704
01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:12.380
MATT: It's very faint. It's barely there.

1705
01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.410
LIAM: Okay, and question to you. Are you offering

1706
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:17.760
a pick of one of these or all of these

1707
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.300
or what is the deal we are talking about?

1708
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.210
MATT: "You can pick two of these or you can take the gems."

1709
01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:23.043
LIAM: May I discuss this with--

1710
01:18:23.043 --> 01:18:23.876
MATT: "Or one and a half

1711
01:18:23.876 --> 01:18:27.221
"I suppose, if that's what you're feeling."

1712
01:18:27.221 --> 01:18:28.880
LIAM: May we have a moment?
MATT: "Yes, please take one."

1713
01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.299
LIAM: Would you turn around please?

1714
01:18:31.299 --> 01:18:32.396
MATT: "It's my room."

1715
01:18:32.396 --> 01:18:35.210
"I'm not going to do that, but thank you.

1716
01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:39.255
"You can go--oh, here this will help. This will help."

1717
01:18:42.815 --> 01:18:45.341
(laughter)

1718
01:18:45.341 --> 01:18:46.808
MARISHA: Do you know that cantrip?

1719
01:18:46.808 --> 01:18:50.490
LIAM: Yeah, I can cast it an unlimited amount. I am very

1720
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:52.110
tempted by the things she is showing me,

1721
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:54.570
but I find it hard to go back to our group

1722
01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:57.600
with no coin and these.

1723
01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:02.500
MARISHA: What if we do take the gems as a down payment

1724
01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:06.230
and then we come back for an item?

1725
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:09.715
LIAM: Doesn't seem like the deal she was offering us.

1726
01:19:09.715 --> 01:19:12.845
MARISHA: I'm counter-offering. I'm negotiating, man.

1727
01:19:12.845 --> 01:19:13.761
LIAM: Okay.

1728
01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.286
MARISHA: I'm just saying,

1729
01:19:16.286 --> 01:19:18.050
because we've got to come back and report

1730
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:21.150
that we've done things right, so we do halves and halves

1731
01:19:21.150 --> 01:19:23.890
and maybe we can figure out what we want

1732
01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:27.800
or we can just take items. She said two items.

1733
01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.480
LIAM: Yeah, that robe and that ring are very tempting to me,

1734
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.858
but I think--
MARISHA: I mean, I think

1735
01:19:31.858 --> 01:19:33.487
Caduceus would love that staff.

1736
01:19:33.487 --> 01:19:36.550
LIAM: I don't know, I've had trouble convincing you

1737
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:40.000
that I'm not an asshole and to go back to our party

1738
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.140
with nothing in hand for the rest of them

1739
01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.590
does not seem wise to me.

1740
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:50.590
MARISHA: Well, we're coming back in hand with a job.

1741
01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:55.612
LIAM: Pro bono, if I come back with stuff.

1742
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.840
MARISHA: Well, we know where the stuff is.

1743
01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.740
Can take the gems now because we know gems are good,

1744
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:11.690
potentially come back for stuff at a later time.

1745
01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:12.740
Does that make sense?

1746
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:15.680
LIAM: It's a simple plan, sure.

1747
01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.463
MARISHA: I don't know.

1748
01:20:17.463 --> 01:20:19.170
LIAM: No, I mean, I want the stuff, but it just doesn't seem

1749
01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:21.887
wise. Let's take the gems.

1750
01:20:21.887 --> 01:20:23.490
We'll take the gems.
TRAVIS: Take the stuff!

1751
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:25.997
LAURA: Take the stuff and maybe--

1752
01:20:25.997 --> 01:20:27.155
(pigeon cooing)

1753
01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:29.346
You don't keep the stuff, maybe. (cooing)

1754
01:20:29.346 --> 01:20:31.104
Maybe show everybody in the group

1755
01:20:31.104 --> 01:20:34.890
all the stuff and we decide who gets it later.

1756
01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:37.956
TRAVIS: The pigeons out here are crazy.

1757
01:20:37.956 --> 01:20:39.970
TALIESIN: Shoo shoo shoo.

1758
01:20:39.970 --> 01:20:42.720
MATT: "Sorry about that. So--"

1759
01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.778
MARISHA: Maybe we should ask about the down payment thing.

1760
01:20:44.778 --> 01:20:47.202
LIAM: Sure. We have a couple of questions.

1761
01:20:47.202 --> 01:20:48.435
My associate will start.

1762
01:20:48.435 --> 01:20:51.150
MATT: "Fire away."

1763
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:53.150
MARISHA: We're very intrigued

1764
01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:57.760
by your menagerie of offerings.

1765
01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:02.070
However, it is hard to make an educated decision

1766
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:05.920
based on the current amount of knowledge that we have.

1767
01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:10.920
So would you be, my fair lady

1768
01:21:11.147 --> 01:21:16.074
would you, professor woman of deep knowledge--

1769
01:21:16.074 --> 01:21:18.565
LIAM: How about Professor Waccoh?

1770
01:21:18.565 --> 01:21:22.190
MARISHA: --be interested in a down payment of some gems

1771
01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:26.680
and then maybe we come back for an item of our choice

1772
01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:31.180
in the future or trade more work for more of those items?

1773
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.486
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1774
01:21:35.486 --> 01:21:37.411
MARISHA: Super my strong point.

1775
01:21:37.411 --> 01:21:39.060
TALIESIN: Eventually it's got to roll well.

1776
01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:42.143
LIAM: This is the one. Get that 20.

1777
01:21:42.143 --> 01:21:44.074
Get that 20.

1778
01:21:44.074 --> 01:21:47.608
MARISHA: You saw it again, you witness it every time.

1779
01:21:47.608 --> 01:21:50.260
It was almost a 19, but instead it's a two,

1780
01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:53.559
no, it's a three.

1781
01:21:53.559 --> 01:21:56.383
Six.

1782
01:21:56.383 --> 01:21:58.624
MATT: She goes,

1783
01:21:58.624 --> 01:22:01.210
"See, there's this thing where I just met you

1784
01:22:01.210 --> 01:22:06.020
"and you're humans and already in a strange place

1785
01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:10.110
"with me personally. So giving you things

1786
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:13.560
"before you've completed a job puts

1787
01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.560
"me in an uncomfortable position. So if that's something

1788
01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.800
"you want to do, that's possible, but we'll have to add

1789
01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.930
"a few more fiddly aspects of this deal, if you understand."

1790
01:22:22.930 --> 01:22:24.337
MARISHA: Oh are we not walking away with these?

1791
01:22:24.337 --> 01:22:26.650
LIAM: Tell us more about that robe, please.

1792
01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:31.133
MATT: "Oh the robe.

1793
01:22:31.133 --> 01:22:32.690
"Unfortunately, I'd have to attune it

1794
01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:35.820
"to even show you, but if you were to,"

1795
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.830
and she takes it and throws it over her shoulders

1796
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:39.340
and opens it up on the inside.

1797
01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.370
It's a dark black velvet,

1798
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:46.370
but in a way that consumes all the light.

1799
01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.787
Like a Vantablack type of a thing

1800
01:22:48.787 --> 01:22:51.627
where it just looks like absolute darkness.

1801
01:22:51.627 --> 01:22:53.460
"If someone were to come at me with a punch,

1802
01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:56.188
"not that they'll actually hit me, I'll kick your ass,

1803
01:22:56.188 --> 01:22:58.455
"but, you know, try to--

1804
01:22:58.455 --> 01:23:00.458
MARISHA: Wait, I'm getting mixed signals.

1805
01:23:00.458 --> 01:23:01.716
Do you want me to come at you?

1806
01:23:01.716 --> 01:23:05.088
MATT: "Pretend you're going to come at me like an attacker."

1807
01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:12.490
MARISHA: Okay, I pretend in a very basic drills

1808
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:15.831
karate 101 way.

1809
01:23:15.831 --> 01:23:17.647
And huh!

1810
01:23:17.647 --> 01:23:20.090
MATT: She like lifts the coat and vampire-wise

1811
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:24.180
and nothing happens. "But if you're attuned to this

1812
01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:27.200
"something'll happen and it'll scare them off, maybe."

1813
01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.760
LIAM: Scare them off?
MATT: "Yeah."

1814
01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.380
LIAM: Okay.

1815
01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:35.000
MATT: "Give them a glimpse into mind-bending realms where--"

1816
01:23:35.935 --> 01:23:36.868
TRAVIS: A-look at my balls!

1817
01:23:36.868 --> 01:23:38.376
MATT: "--shapes are strange!"

1818
01:23:38.376 --> 01:23:40.966
(laughter)

1819
01:23:40.966 --> 01:23:42.762
LIAM: Maybe there is a middle ground. How would you

1820
01:23:42.762 --> 01:23:45.810
feel about say doing a third of your gems there

1821
01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:47.880
and one of these items?

1822
01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.271
MARISHA: I thought it was half the gems

1823
01:23:49.271 --> 01:23:50.110
and then one of the items?

1824
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:52.490
MATT: "That sounds like a great deal, I can take that."

1825
01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:57.472
MARISHA: No, he's confused on Xhorhasian math.

1826
01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:02.380
We're still--you guys are on metric system and we're not

1827
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:06.376
there yet on the Empire, so--

1828
01:24:06.376 --> 01:24:07.351
LIAM: So is it half and half?
MARISHA: Yes.

1829
01:24:07.351 --> 01:24:08.880
LIAM: Okay.

1830
01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.470
MARISHA: Are we making this deal now and we're going

1831
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:12.750
to come back for it later? Hang on.

1832
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:15.330
Marisha to the DM for a second.

1833
01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:17.360
MATT: Yes, you're making this deal at the moment.

1834
01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.910
MARISHA: Is it, are we making the deal and then

1835
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:22.440
we're going to go complete it and then this is the reward

1836
01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.733
we get when we come back?
MATT: Correct, yes.

1837
01:24:24.733 --> 01:24:26.370
LAURA: So you don't have to choose now.

1838
01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:27.410
MARISHA: Do we have to choose now?

1839
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:28.834
SAM: Don't send Nott and Jester in.

1840
01:24:28.834 --> 01:24:31.217
They're the worst at this.

1841
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:35.883
LIAM: We know. We almost all died.

1842
01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:39.430
MARISHA: Doing pretty good, considering.

1843
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:40.800
SAM and LAURA: You're doing great.

1844
01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.275
SAM: Keep it up.

1845
01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.500
MARISHA: I thought we were doing half--

1846
01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.752
from Marisha to the DM--I thought we were doing

1847
01:24:48.752 --> 01:24:51.760
a down payment thing.

1848
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.460
MATT: There could have been if a persuasion check--

1849
01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.910
MARISHA: Right, had I not rolled a three.

1850
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:58.129
MATT: I know, it's okay, it happens.

1851
01:24:58.129 --> 01:25:00.300
TALIESIN: A lot.

1852
01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.640
MARISHA: I will fucking pimp slap you.

1853
01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.178
LAURA: It was him.
MATT: It was Taliesin.

1854
01:25:05.178 --> 01:25:08.288
MARISHA: Oh shit!

1855
01:25:08.288 --> 01:25:10.260
SAM: I'm just over here, minding my business,

1856
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:13.080
worrying about my doomed campaign.

1857
01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.251
MARISHA: Sorry, the shade is just normally from you.

1858
01:25:16.251 --> 01:25:19.159
TALIESIN: It was shade towards your dice; it wasn't you.

1859
01:25:19.159 --> 01:25:20.479
TRAVIS: The offer still stands.

1860
01:25:20.479 --> 01:25:21.610
She can still pimp slap you.

1861
01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:23.652
MARISHA: You deserved it at some point in your time.

1862
01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:26.790
SAM: For sure.

1863
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:29.478
Absolutely.

1864
01:25:29.478 --> 01:25:30.311
LIAM: Well, we'll figure this out later.

1865
01:25:30.311 --> 01:25:31.760
MARISHA: Yeah, we can we decide when we come back

1866
01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.181
with the rest of our team?
MATT: "Sure, sure."

1867
01:25:34.181 --> 01:25:36.993
MARISHA: Cool.

1868
01:25:36.993 --> 01:25:38.820
MATT: "Hey, I'll tell you what, tell you what.

1869
01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:41.345
"Step forward a little bit.

1870
01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.730
"If you're having a hard time deciding,

1871
01:25:46.730 --> 01:25:49.010
"I'll throw a little something extra in.

1872
01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:54.010
"If you can creatively figure out a way

1873
01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:00.240
"to embarrass the shit out of the foreman for me.

1874
01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.000
LIAM: Oh we have a ringer for that.

1875
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.940
MARISHA: Uh huh.
MATT: "Okay.

1876
01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.020
"Just a little addendum, not necessary,

1877
01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:09.730
"job's not dependent on it, but if you do this for me,

1878
01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:13.810
"I'll look favorably on the reward."

1879
01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:16.930
MARISHA: Public embarrassment?
MATT: "Oh preferably."

1880
01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:19.055
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: Deal.

1881
01:26:19.055 --> 01:26:20.782
MATT: "Thanks."

1882
01:26:20.782 --> 01:26:24.270
MARISHA: Can I borrow one of your books for a second?

1883
01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:25.103
MATT: "Why?"

1884
01:26:25.103 --> 01:26:26.419
MARISHA: I just want to demonstrate

1885
01:26:26.419 --> 01:26:27.470
the public embarrassment.

1886
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:31.140
MATT: "Okay, yeah, like empty or do you want?"

1887
01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:32.370
MARISHA: Whatever.

1888
01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:34.590
MATT: "Oh, well, just sure."

1889
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:36.460
MARISHA: You have a pen?

1890
01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:41.190
MATT: "I have ink, here."

1891
01:26:41.190 --> 01:26:45.260
MARISHA: I draw a dick in the margin.

1892
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:46.626
MATT: "That's a--"

1893
01:26:46.626 --> 01:26:48.148
MARISHA: But think on a bigger scale.

1894
01:26:48.148 --> 01:26:52.510
MATT: "Yeah, preferably something more involved than that.

1895
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:54.540
"I don't see how that would necessarily embarrass him."

1896
01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:56.310
LIAM: Just an appetizer, just an appetizer.

1897
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:59.570
On a related note, I have another question.

1898
01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:02.320
I was led to believe by our patron, the queen herself,

1899
01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.645
that we would be able to peruse the stacks here

1900
01:27:05.645 --> 01:27:08.448
at the Marble Tomes. Is that possible?

1901
01:27:08.448 --> 01:27:12.330
We are trying to learn a little more about our new home

1902
01:27:12.330 --> 01:27:14.030
and better understand our footing here

1903
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:17.700
and what we are doing for the Dynasty.

1904
01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.625
It was discussed and--

1905
01:27:19.625 --> 01:27:21.691
MATT: "I'm sure it was discussed."

1906
01:27:21.691 --> 01:27:24.257
"I'm--(laughs nervously)

1907
01:27:24.257 --> 01:27:25.832
MARISHA: How about when we come back?

1908
01:27:25.832 --> 01:27:28.180
MATT: "Do some good deeds.

1909
01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:32.160
"Show me that you can be trusted and do this fine thing

1910
01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.160
"for the goodwill of our conflict and then we can discuss,

1911
01:27:37.170 --> 01:27:40.950
"maybe. Just understand there is a wide variety

1912
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:44.040
"of various bits of information that is kept here,

1913
01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.412
"some of which is very, very classified,

1914
01:27:47.412 --> 01:27:50.870
"so can't just let you walk around grabbing what you want.

1915
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:53.040
"Perhaps there can be approvals that can be put,

1916
01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.886
"depending on what you are researching--

1917
01:27:54.886 --> 01:27:56.640
LIAM: We have friends in very high places.

1918
01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:01.330
MATT: "Of course, no, and as do I so we can talk later."

1919
01:28:01.330 --> 01:28:03.590
LIAM: Understood. Well, we have the deal.

1920
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:05.990
MATT: "A deal is done, great, thank you."

1921
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:09.570
Reaches out and grabs. Her fingers are long and boney

1922
01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:13.320
and cold to the touch, but she's smiling the whole way

1923
01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.996
that one big tusk pushing up into the cheek.

1924
01:28:17.996 --> 01:28:19.637
LIAM: I have a good feeling about this relationship.

1925
01:28:19.637 --> 01:28:20.930
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1926
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:24.270
MATT: "I hope so, good luck, good luck, go."

1927
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:26.319
MARISHA: Fuck Bodo, am I right?

1928
01:28:26.319 --> 01:28:30.150
MATT: "That's right. (laughs) I like you. Jury's out.

1929
01:28:30.150 --> 01:28:35.000
"I like you. All right, great,

1930
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.290
"go do stuff Thank you.."

1931
01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:40.370
LIAM: Time to go draw some dicks, let's do this.

1932
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:42.988
MARISHA: I did it, though, I got in the dick!

1933
01:28:42.988 --> 01:28:44.890
Do you think Jester will be proud?

1934
01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:46.460
LIAM: Yeah, that's a start.
MATT: You guys walk out

1935
01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:48.460
you hear the door (creaking).

1936
01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:52.100
She's staring with the one eye peeking through.

1937
01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:54.956
Closes.

1938
01:28:54.956 --> 01:28:56.510
The Aurora Watchman is there.

1939
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:59.640
"Did you get everything that you need?"

1940
01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:02.610
LIAM: We got a taste, we'll be back. Thank you.

1941
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:03.530
MATT: "Of course."

1942
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:07.420
MARISHA: What was your name?

1943
01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.078
MATT: "Desmond."

1944
01:29:09.078 --> 01:29:14.078
MARISHA: Nice to meet you Desmond. Okay, bye.

1945
01:29:14.635 --> 01:29:15.668
LIAM: I think he has to walk us back through

1946
01:29:15.668 --> 01:29:17.140
all those hallways again.

1947
01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:19.910
Would you lead the way please?
MATT: "Right this way."

1948
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:22.980
Leads you back where you came, eventually escorting you

1949
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.370
back to the outside of the main courtyard

1950
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:29.003
of the Marble Tomes Conservatory.

1951
01:29:29.983 --> 01:29:32.424
LIAM: All right. Well, that went

1952
01:29:32.424 --> 01:29:34.300
about as well as I expected.

1953
01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:35.150
MARISHA: Yeah.

1954
01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:37.652
LIAM: Let's go find the other assholes.

1955
01:29:37.652 --> 01:29:40.352
MATT: Come back to you guys.

1956
01:29:40.352 --> 01:29:44.540
We'll say, for the sake of

1957
01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:47.763
the ease of shopping for clothing and shoes,

1958
01:29:47.763 --> 01:29:51.750
for a meager price of five silver,

1959
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:56.410
you manage to acquire a fine heavy pair of shoes

1960
01:29:56.410 --> 01:30:00.490
that sit well on Yeza's feet, a nice cloak and coat

1961
01:30:00.490 --> 01:30:02.740
that seems to definitely seems to be an upgrade

1962
01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:04.920
from the tattered outfit that

1963
01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:06.550
he's kept since he was imprisoned.

1964
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:10.840
LAURA: Is there a particular fashion here?

1965
01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.480
Do the style of clothing look different

1966
01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.905
than they do in the Empire?

1967
01:30:14.905 --> 01:30:17.190
MATT: Yeah. Well, as far as the Dynasty and the drow,

1968
01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:22.190
there's definitely hints of elvish elegance,

1969
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:25.200
but a lot of the cuts seem to be a lot more geometric,

1970
01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:29.500
hard angles. It's interesting; elements of it

1971
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:33.660
remind you of how angular some dwarven designs are,

1972
01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:38.190
but they go from curves into angles. So yeah, it's unique.

1973
01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:40.650
That's for the drow. As you guys are traveling around,

1974
01:30:40.650 --> 01:30:45.417
you also notice beyond the

1975
01:30:45.417 --> 01:30:46.675
dark elves that you see,

1976
01:30:46.675 --> 01:30:48.091
which is still the majority of the populace

1977
01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:49.307
here in the center

1978
01:30:49.307 --> 01:30:52.150
and the other goblinoids and ogres and beasts

1979
01:30:52.150 --> 01:30:54.869
and the occasional giant you see that comes through,

1980
01:30:54.869 --> 01:30:58.619
a hill giant that wanders, you only see one as you're

1981
01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:02.427
traveling through the Gallimaufry--

1982
01:31:02.427 --> 01:31:04.940
you also see a couple of dwarves,

1983
01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.680
but not the typical dwarves.

1984
01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:10.880
These are gray-skinned;

1985
01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.980
either dark, jet black or

1986
01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:17.980
bright red auburn hair,

1987
01:31:18.338 --> 01:31:21.930
pale eyes.

1988
01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:23.930
It's unique. You've not quite seen dwarves like this

1989
01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:27.240
and you only see two in the streets as you wander through,

1990
01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.670
rare in comparison to a lot of the other folk here.

1991
01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.466
SAM: Yeah, I see.
LAURA: It's different

1992
01:31:33.466 --> 01:31:35.174
than I've ever seen before.

1993
01:31:35.174 --> 01:31:38.049
SAM: Everything here is a bit different, yes.

1994
01:31:38.049 --> 01:31:39.707
MATT: You pass by a place called

1995
01:31:39.707 --> 01:31:42.600
Turmin's Tinctures and Tonics, right next to Fadden's Gems,

1996
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.613
which is where you're heading.

1997
01:31:44.613 --> 01:31:47.730
SAM: Turmin's Tinctures--
MATT: Turmin's Tinctures

1998
01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:51.547
and Tonics.
LIAM: Stay turnt.

1999
01:31:51.547 --> 01:31:55.070
SAM: Were we supposed to get Caleb some paper or something?

2000
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:56.830
LAURA: No, he's going to get it himself.

2001
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:58.255
TALIESIN: Caleb said he was going to

2002
01:31:58.255 --> 01:31:59.763
take care of that himself.

2003
01:31:59.763 --> 01:32:02.620
SAM: All right, get your gems.
LAURA: We need gems!

2004
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:06.720
MATT: You come in barreling. It's a small chamber.

2005
01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.310
It's maybe eight-foot by ten-foot.

2006
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:11.940
There isn't an elaborate need to show off many gems

2007
01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:15.110
and even so, most of the interior, is comfortable.

2008
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:18.680
Stained woods. It's the general purple wood

2009
01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.370
that you've seen used primarily through

2010
01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:24.093
most of the things in Xhorhas, but it's stained even darker.

2011
01:32:24.093 --> 01:32:27.554
Grooves are cut into it and gold cord is pressed

2012
01:32:27.554 --> 01:32:30.196
into the grooves to give this nice trim

2013
01:32:30.196 --> 01:32:32.400
around the different pieces of furniture.

2014
01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.970
There are two long glass cases that have all these

2015
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:37.750
different cuts of gems and pieces of jewelry

2016
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:42.360
that are set and on display with a faint series

2017
01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.828
of small glass globes about the size of a gold piece

2018
01:32:44.828 --> 01:32:49.543
that are set inside giving an inset glow.

2019
01:32:49.543 --> 01:32:53.219
On the opposite end, you do see

2020
01:32:53.219 --> 01:32:56.652
one woman, a dark elf

2021
01:32:56.652 --> 01:33:01.652
who seems to be napping

2022
01:33:02.881 --> 01:33:05.360
at the moment or at least is like eyes somewhat closed

2023
01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:08.607
leaning back in a chair.

2024
01:33:08.607 --> 01:33:13.410
Her hair is a little tangled and long, but really nice robe.

2025
01:33:13.410 --> 01:33:15.710
Looks to be a little older.

2026
01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:19.463
TALIESIN: You enjoy waking people up, I figure you can.

2027
01:33:19.463 --> 01:33:22.340
LAURA: Mm, mm-hmm, I go up and I tickle under her chin.

2028
01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:27.340
MATT: Okay. As your hand goes up, a hand catches yours.

2029
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:31.150
"Do not mistake this for sleep, darling."

2030
01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:34.230
LAURA: Oh, were you not sleeping?

2031
01:33:34.230 --> 01:33:38.760
MATT: "No. Can I help you?"

2032
01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:43.399
LAURA: Yes, I would very much like some gems, please.

2033
01:33:43.399 --> 01:33:44.674
As my hand's caught.

2034
01:33:44.674 --> 01:33:45.707
MATT: "What kind of gems?"

2035
01:33:45.707 --> 01:33:47.716
She's still holding onto your wrist.

2036
01:33:47.716 --> 01:33:50.799
LAURA: Like, you know, pretty ones, like diamonds and stuff.

2037
01:33:50.799 --> 01:33:51.715
TALIESIN: (clears throat)

2038
01:33:51.715 --> 01:33:52.720
LAURA: Diamonds?
TALIESIN: Diamonds.

2039
01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:57.460
LAURA: Specifically diamonds.
MATT: "Well, we have a few."

2040
01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.483
LAURA: As she lets go, I tickle her.

2041
01:33:59.483 --> 01:34:01.990
(laughter)

2042
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:05.323
MATT: She bats you away.

2043
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:08.900
She begins to show off these small diamonds

2044
01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:11.566
inset into

2045
01:34:11.566 --> 01:34:15.374
amulets and rings.

2046
01:34:15.374 --> 01:34:19.382
There's an actual tea saucer that has gems.

2047
01:34:19.382 --> 01:34:22.482
It's a beautiful porcelain. It's a very upper scale--

2048
01:34:22.482 --> 01:34:23.640
TALIESIN: That seems extravagant.

2049
01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.009
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I don't know.

2050
01:34:25.009 --> 01:34:26.392
LAURA: We actually don't need--

2051
01:34:26.392 --> 01:34:27.383
TALIESIN: Settings.

2052
01:34:27.383 --> 01:34:30.366
LAURA: Yeah. We just the need loose gems.

2053
01:34:30.366 --> 01:34:32.132
MATT: "How many?"

2054
01:34:32.132 --> 01:34:34.500
LAURA: Like 800 gold worth of them.

2055
01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:35.970
TALIESIN: Specifically--
LAURA: Oh, they need to be

2056
01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:39.810
one solid one, a 500 and a 300ish.

2057
01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:41.952
TALIESIN: In about that clarity.

2058
01:34:41.952 --> 01:34:43.702
LAURA: Something nice, you know.

2059
01:34:43.702 --> 01:34:46.685
TALIESIN: If you have anything.

2060
01:34:46.685 --> 01:34:48.130
MATT: Let me double check here.

2061
01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:50.588
LAURA: It could be a princess cut or--

2062
01:34:50.588 --> 01:34:52.063
MATT: It doesn't have to be a single one.

2063
01:34:52.063 --> 01:34:52.896
TALIESIN: Really, it could be just--

2064
01:34:52.896 --> 01:34:54.221
MATT: It says, "diamonds worth."

2065
01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:55.737
LAURA: It could be handful

2066
01:34:55.737 --> 01:34:59.340
of little shitty ones, whatever you think.

2067
01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.810
MATT: Raise Dead has to be a diamond worth at least 500,

2068
01:35:01.810 --> 01:35:05.078
but for Revivify, it can be in a grouping.

2069
01:35:05.078 --> 01:35:08.261
TALIESIN: So one 500 gold piece diamond

2070
01:35:08.261 --> 01:35:11.119
and maybe 300 gold pieces worth of assorted.

2071
01:35:11.119 --> 01:35:12.644
MATT: "Very well I will look."

2072
01:35:12.644 --> 01:35:16.800
She turns around, but keeps an eye on the rest of you.

2073
01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.080
LAURA: Also, if you ever, like,

2074
01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.160
if you're trying to cut your diamonds and stuff

2075
01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.960
and one shatters because you cut it wrong or something

2076
01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.168
and it turns into dust,

2077
01:35:25.168 --> 01:35:28.670
do you have anything like that, maybe?

2078
01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:31.360
MATT: "No."
LAURA: Okay, just wondering.

2079
01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.000
MATT: "I am very careful with my cuts."

2080
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.520
LAURA: Okay.

2081
01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:40.880
MATT: "Anyway," and she produces a fairly decent sized

2082
01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:45.817
well-cut clear diamond. It's about that big or so.

2083
01:35:46.717 --> 01:35:51.717
It would be the equivalent of 5-600 gold just looking at it

2084
01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:54.510
or this is how she presents it.

2085
01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:58.110
LAURA: That's really nice.
TALIESIN: Is that giving me

2086
01:35:58.110 --> 01:35:59.950
the feeling that that will do what's necessary?

2087
01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:03.541
MATT: Yeah, it's thin, but it's a wide piece there.

2088
01:36:03.541 --> 01:36:05.135
LAURA: It's not like a CZ or something,

2089
01:36:05.135 --> 01:36:06.629
you're not trying to fuck us over.

2090
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:08.045
TRAVIS: Are those words?
LIAM: A cubic zirconia.

2091
01:36:08.045 --> 01:36:09.020
TRAVIS: A CZ.

2092
01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.470
TALIESIN: Seesaw?
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2093
01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:14.458
MATT: Make a perception check with your

2094
01:36:14.458 --> 01:36:17.080
vast knowledge of diamonds and jewel craft.

2095
01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.171
LAURA: Yes.

2096
01:36:20.549 --> 01:36:22.822
Eight.

2097
01:36:22.822 --> 01:36:24.961
MATT: I mean, it's a diamond.

2098
01:36:24.961 --> 01:36:27.131
LAURA: It's really pretty, it's a good diamond.

2099
01:36:27.131 --> 01:36:28.882
TALIESIN: It is very pretty, it's got a lot of sparkle.

2100
01:36:28.882 --> 01:36:30.538
MATT: There's a scattering of a few others

2101
01:36:30.538 --> 01:36:32.040
and she goes, "All right, for these together

2102
01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:36.620
"that would be 850 gold."

2103
01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:38.669
LAURA: Cool cool cool. Uh!

2104
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:41.552
SAM: (laughs)

2105
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:46.490
LAURA: This is--the Bright Queen gave us this.

2106
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:48.650
We're--she likes us a lot.

2107
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:54.000
MATT: "I can see that, yes."
TRAVIS: Jesus.

2108
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.450
LAURA: If you happen to, you know, treat us nicely

2109
01:36:58.450 --> 01:37:01.290
we could tell her that you're pretty cool and stuff.

2110
01:37:01.290 --> 01:37:03.650
We have a good line to her.

2111
01:37:04.684 --> 01:37:07.030
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

2112
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:08.290
SAM: Advantage.
LAURA: Woo.

2113
01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:11.193
LIAM: Because Laura is so charming.

2114
01:37:13.604 --> 01:37:14.437
LAURA: Oh.
(groaning)

2115
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:17.110
TALIESIN: You are being punished.

2116
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:20.615
LAURA: Eight plus five is--
SAM: 13.

2117
01:37:20.615 --> 01:37:22.568
LAURA: 13, double eights.

2118
01:37:22.568 --> 01:37:23.809
LIAM: This is the side that shoots

2119
01:37:23.809 --> 01:37:26.184
exploding arrows at their dying friends.

2120
01:37:26.184 --> 01:37:28.535
(laughter)

2121
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:33.583
MATT: "Well, you see I've already cut quite a few gems

2122
01:37:33.583 --> 01:37:35.304
"for a number of the Dens."

2123
01:37:35.304 --> 01:37:38.806
SAM: I'm not saying anything and everybody is hating on me.

2124
01:37:38.806 --> 01:37:42.720
MATT: Oh buddy, no.
SAM: It's okay.

2125
01:37:44.055 --> 01:37:45.546
MARISHA: He started it.

2126
01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:48.678
TRAVIS: You suck.

2127
01:37:48.678 --> 01:37:51.818
(laughter)

2128
01:37:51.818 --> 01:37:54.592
TALIESIN: I feel my sympathy vote shifting now.

2129
01:37:54.592 --> 01:37:57.622
TRAVIS: Clever ploy.
LAURA: Oh shit.

2130
01:37:57.622 --> 01:37:59.471
LIAM: Don't be fooled by the donkey

2131
01:37:59.471 --> 01:38:01.154
in the Jeff Goldblum mask.

2132
01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:07.360
MATT: "I have done quite a few jewelry settings

2133
01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:10.336
"for the Bright Queen and many Dens at the top."

2134
01:38:10.336 --> 01:38:11.962
SAM: I will pimp slap you.

2135
01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:17.610
MATT: "So I have the pull I require but thank you.

2136
01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:18.860
"The deal is at it stands."

2137
01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:24.360
LAURA: Okay, 850 then, that works for me.

2138
01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:27.360
Here you go then.

2139
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:30.423
MATT: "Thank you.

2140
01:38:30.423 --> 01:38:31.714
TALIESIN: Do you have all the money?

2141
01:38:31.714 --> 01:38:33.064
LAURA: Yeah I guess, I guess so.

2142
01:38:33.064 --> 01:38:34.547
TALIESIN: I like that the word "fuck"

2143
01:38:34.547 --> 01:38:36.089
just fell into your dice jail.

2144
01:38:36.089 --> 01:38:37.370
MATT: Somebody mark off what you spent.

2145
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:41.748
LAURA: "Fuck" just fell into this dice jail, literally.

2146
01:38:42.843 --> 01:38:43.676
"Fuck."

2147
01:38:44.581 --> 01:38:48.680
Okay, mm, yes, 850.

2148
01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.187
MATT: All right, so you have your diamonds.

2149
01:38:51.187 --> 01:38:54.920
TRAVIS: So Taliesin, 250 to help.

2150
01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:58.680
LAURA: I thought yes, you want to give, like--

2151
01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.020
no, it's hold on, I have to--
LIAM: What a journey.

2152
01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:06.960
LAURA: We have 400 from other people,

2153
01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.160
so if you were to give 100, and then I'll give 100.

2154
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.793
TALIESIN: I'll give 100.

2155
01:39:12.793 --> 01:39:14.320
LAURA: That's brings us to 700.

2156
01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.840
And then you already gave some.

2157
01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:19.187
Did I mark everything?

2158
01:39:19.187 --> 01:39:20.361
SAM: You did.

2159
01:39:20.361 --> 01:39:22.111
LAURA: Yeah give me another 50, Fjord.

2160
01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:28.030
LAURA: I'll give another 50 as well, so I'll give 150.

2161
01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:31.399
MATT: All righty.

2162
01:39:31.399 --> 01:39:32.232
"Is that all that you require?"

2163
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:35.270
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think so.

2164
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:37.820
LAURA: Unless you got straight razors here or something?

2165
01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:40.970
MATT: "No."

2166
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:43.470
LAURA: Did you make the Bright Queen's awesome armor?

2167
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:47.730
There were opals on it, were there opals on it?

2168
01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:49.580
I saw them.
MATT: "Those were not mine."

2169
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:51.663
LAURA: Oh.

2170
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:55.092
It's too bad.

2171
01:39:55.092 --> 01:39:57.648
Because it was pretty cool.

2172
01:39:57.648 --> 01:39:59.760
MATT: "Thank you for your patronage. You may leave."

2173
01:40:00.737 --> 01:40:02.037
TALIESIN: We're making friends.

2174
01:40:02.037 --> 01:40:02.870
LAURA: Yeah.

2175
01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:07.335
LAURA: You have a very soft chin.

2176
01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:08.876
I say as I leave.

2177
01:40:10.347 --> 01:40:12.013
TALIESIN: Wow. We now know who

2178
01:40:12.013 --> 01:40:15.160
the big bad of this season's going to be.

2179
01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.093
MATT: Marking that down.

2180
01:40:17.093 --> 01:40:19.847
TRAVIS: Who has a soft chin now?!

2181
01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:22.100
TALIESIN: The dungeon master will remember this.

2182
01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.470
TALIESIN: Other than trying to find a razor,

2183
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:29.630
just general razor and potions I guess but I mean--

2184
01:40:29.630 --> 01:40:31.470
LAURA: That's next door probably.

2185
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:32.303
MATT: You can check.

2186
01:40:32.303 --> 01:40:33.486
SAM: Yeah, while they're in there,

2187
01:40:33.486 --> 01:40:35.018
me and Yasha will go next

2188
01:40:35.018 --> 01:40:36.168
door and see if there's any potions.

2189
01:40:36.168 --> 01:40:37.780
Are you with us, Fjordy?
TRAVIS: Nah, I'm with them.

2190
01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:40.659
SAM: Okay, we'll go next door and check the potions.

2191
01:40:40.659 --> 01:40:42.092
MATT: The two of you head into

2192
01:40:42.092 --> 01:40:43.392
Turmin's Tinctures and Tonics.

2193
01:40:43.392 --> 01:40:46.002
You can see the wooden sign outside is dangling

2194
01:40:46.002 --> 01:40:48.650
and as you push through the front door it hits a bell

2195
01:40:48.650 --> 01:40:52.090
that's like (ringing). You look inside.

2196
01:40:52.090 --> 01:40:57.090
A whole series of very strong Sephora-like smells competing.

2197
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:04.132
There are two rows on each side.

2198
01:41:04.132 --> 01:41:07.170
It's a long building, it's maybe 10 feet wide

2199
01:41:07.170 --> 01:41:12.170
and about 20 feet down the way, but there are all sorts of

2200
01:41:12.428 --> 01:41:17.428
dried herbs and plants and roots and things that are

2201
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:19.400
hanging up there that are probably creating a lot of the

2202
01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:22.490
scent, but even then it seems very strong for things

2203
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:24.490
that have maybe been dried out this long.

2204
01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:28.290
There are small dishes that contain oils in them

2205
01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:30.090
that also are emitting strong smells.

2206
01:41:30.090 --> 01:41:33.390
You can see all sorts of vials that are crystal and glass

2207
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:36.880
that are all arranged with little labels in front of them.

2208
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.750
Into the back of the chamber, you see

2209
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:41.960
standing there, arms crossed, another one

2210
01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:46.450
of these dwarf figures with the even gray skin,

2211
01:41:46.450 --> 01:41:49.390
permanent scowl on the face, these almost pupil-less

2212
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:51.200
white eyes looking toward you.

2213
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:57.960
The hair is a deep set red maroon color.

2214
01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:02.560
It's parted in the center and this puff of red

2215
01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.803
for a beard and he just looks out and he goes,

2216
01:42:05.803 --> 01:42:09.840
"So what you looking for?"

2217
01:42:11.410 --> 01:42:13.450
SAM: We're here looking for some potions.

2218
01:42:13.450 --> 01:42:16.470
ASHLEY: Yes, hello.
SAM: We're new to the city

2219
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:19.810
but we're excited to meet its locals.

2220
01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:23.417
This is my husband, he's never been here before.

2221
01:42:23.417 --> 01:42:25.700
MATT: He pokes out from his-- "Hi."

2222
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:28.500
SAM: Do you have any healing potions or any other

2223
01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.650
useful potions for adventurers?

2224
01:42:30.650 --> 01:42:34.760
MATT: "Oh, we've got all sorts of useful potions.

2225
01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:39.124
"Look about yer side this way. We've got ones for virility,

2226
01:42:39.124 --> 01:42:41.830
"as you say you've got your husband.

2227
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:44.320
"We've got ones that give you strength of spirit,

2228
01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.603
"we've got ones that give you better dreams,

2229
01:42:46.603 --> 01:42:49.220
"some with shiny hair."

2230
01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:51.720
Yeza goes up and starts inspecting one and is like,

2231
01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.872
"These are pretty poorly made.

2232
01:42:56.514 --> 01:42:59.580
"What's your distilling process, just out of curiosity?"

2233
01:43:00.517 --> 01:43:02.944
ASHLEY: Useful, useful.
LIAM: Alchemy shade.

2234
01:43:02.944 --> 01:43:07.944
SAM: I think we're looking for more of the advanced potions.

2235
01:43:08.490 --> 01:43:10.940
MATT: "Well, these are advanced, what are you thinking?"

2236
01:43:12.130 --> 01:43:14.647
ASHLEY: That just seems a little tame

2237
01:43:14.647 --> 01:43:16.090
for what we're looking for.

2238
01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:19.990
SAM: Yes, not sort of meta medicine, but actual medicine.

2239
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:21.410
MATT: "I know what you're talking a--come this way,

2240
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:24.150
"come this way. More behind-the-counter shite."

2241
01:43:25.489 --> 01:43:27.324
ASHLEY: Behind-the-counter stuff, yes.

2242
01:43:27.324 --> 01:43:30.090
MATT: He pulls out this two tiny, tiny glass vials

2243
01:43:30.090 --> 01:43:32.450
that each have a chain on the end

2244
01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:33.780
with a piece of leather. It looks like it can be

2245
01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:36.320
wrapped around a belt loop or something.

2246
01:43:38.156 --> 01:43:40.850
He's like, "Something a little more wild you said, right?

2247
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:44.080
"Now these here these will give you the drive

2248
01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:47.450
"of a fucking rhinoceros, if you know what I'm saying."

2249
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:48.733
(Marisha sneezes)

2250
01:43:48.733 --> 01:43:50.458
MATT: Bless you.

2251
01:43:50.458 --> 01:43:52.616
MARISHA: Sorry, I was laughing--

2252
01:43:52.616 --> 01:43:54.001
LIAM: I got a little spray.

2253
01:43:54.001 --> 01:43:56.225
(laughter)

2254
01:43:56.225 --> 01:43:58.516
TALIESIN: First three rows man,

2255
01:43:58.516 --> 01:43:59.991
There's a warning on the door.

2256
01:43:59.991 --> 01:44:01.357
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

2257
01:44:01.357 --> 01:44:05.250
ASHLEY and SAM: The drive of a rhinoceros?

2258
01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:06.950
MATT: "You wanting more wild you said right?"

2259
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:09.380
SAM: Yes, please.
MATT: "Right, yeah."

2260
01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:11.280
ASHLEY: What happens when you have that?

2261
01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.713
MATT: "Oh it gets you all worked up and

2262
01:44:13.713 --> 01:44:16.270
you just go all night long.

2263
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:19.640
SAM: It's specifically for fucking or is it for anything?

2264
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.810
MATT: "Is that not that what you're asking about?"

2265
01:44:21.810 --> 01:44:25.557
SAM: Oh no, we're adventurers but not that kind.

2266
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.037
ASHLEY: I think I might have

2267
01:44:29.037 --> 01:44:30.607
steered you in the wrong direction.

2268
01:44:30.607 --> 01:44:33.082
SAM: We're not on a sexual journey of awakening or anything.

2269
01:44:33.082 --> 01:44:34.280
We fight things.

2270
01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:38.160
ASHLEY: What's the other one, since we're on the subject.

2271
01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.820
I'm curious about what the other one was.

2272
01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:42.973
MATT: "Well, it's the same. I have two."

2273
01:44:42.973 --> 01:44:44.420
TRAVIS: Double shot.

2274
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:47.190
SAM: You don't want one of the partners to have it

2275
01:44:47.190 --> 01:44:51.267
because otherwise it would be like (screams).

2276
01:44:51.267 --> 01:44:54.960
MATT: Yeza goes, "Can I see one of those real fast?"

2277
01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:58.330
SAM: Oh yeah, here. I'll give him my magnifying glass.

2278
01:44:58.330 --> 01:45:00.086
Check it out.
MATT: He goes--

2279
01:45:00.086 --> 01:45:02.093
TRAVIS: Aah! Three hours!

2280
01:45:02.093 --> 01:45:05.843
MATT: He goes like, (sniffs)

2281
01:45:05.843 --> 01:45:07.134
"Thank you."

2282
01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:09.009
SAM: What is it?

2283
01:45:09.009 --> 01:45:11.542
MATT: "It's petal tonic. It's water."

2284
01:45:11.542 --> 01:45:13.320
SAM: Oh.

2285
01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:16.520
I love this guy.
ASHLEY: He's the best.

2286
01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:19.360
SAM: No thank you, Turmin, I presume.

2287
01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.310
MATT: "That's me, I'm Turmin."
SAM: No thank you.

2288
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:24.410
Do you have anything that could heal someone?

2289
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:27.284
MATT: "I got some healing potions--

2290
01:45:27.284 --> 01:45:29.270
SAM: Imbued with special powers, perhaps?

2291
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:31.764
MATT: "Well, of course, who do you take me for?"

2292
01:45:31.764 --> 01:45:33.607
SAM: But not just sex power.

2293
01:45:33.607 --> 01:45:35.740
MATT: "...We've got some."

2294
01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:38.860
(laughter)

2295
01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:40.306
SAM: Whatcha got?

2296
01:45:40.306 --> 01:45:42.047
MATT: "Fucking goblins, I swear."

2297
01:45:42.047 --> 01:45:43.514
SAM: I've got a chemist with me

2298
01:45:43.514 --> 01:45:45.040
so no fucking around anymore.

2299
01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.232
MATT: "Oh, you got a chemist."

2300
01:45:50.315 --> 01:45:53.200
Glances over and Yeza's like,

2301
01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:56.296
just gets behind you and hides.

2302
01:45:56.296 --> 01:45:57.800
SAM: I'll take care of you baby.

2303
01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.497
MATT: "Is that a halfling?"

2304
01:46:02.410 --> 01:46:03.243
SAM: Maybe.

2305
01:46:05.230 --> 01:46:07.805
MATT: "And a goblin?"

2306
01:46:07.805 --> 01:46:09.275
SAM: Yeah.

2307
01:46:09.275 --> 01:46:11.825
MATT: "Kinky.

2308
01:46:11.825 --> 01:46:14.425
"Now."

2309
01:46:14.425 --> 01:46:16.010
Yeza goes, "I don't like him."

2310
01:46:18.823 --> 01:46:20.595
"Got a few things here all right."

2311
01:46:20.595 --> 01:46:22.220
He goes and handles up here.

2312
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:23.053
"Okay."

2313
01:46:27.684 --> 01:46:29.184
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh.
ALL: Oh!

2314
01:46:30.148 --> 01:46:31.548
LAURA: Oh Ash, you haven't seen these.

2315
01:46:31.548 --> 01:46:32.651
ASHLEY: No!

2316
01:46:32.651 --> 01:46:34.850
LIAM: These are healing potions.

2317
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:37.670
LAURA: Matt made them himself.
ASHLEY: No way.

2318
01:46:37.670 --> 01:46:39.309
SAM: He has no life.

2319
01:46:40.884 --> 01:46:44.530
MATT: "Got four of these basic ones here and one of these

2320
01:46:44.530 --> 01:46:47.900
"greater types here for sale, if you're interested.

2321
01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:52.068
"And I've got--no you wouldn't want that."

2322
01:46:52.068 --> 01:46:54.460
SAM: Hey, you're looking at a goblin

2323
01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:56.130
with a halfling over here.

2324
01:46:56.130 --> 01:46:57.860
We'll want anything you got.

2325
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.150
MATT: "Well, maybe in case

2326
01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:05.000
any of you are feeling a bit ill,"

2327
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.658
and he pulls up this other vial

2328
01:47:06.658 --> 01:47:09.083
that has this weird, swirling

2329
01:47:11.863 --> 01:47:15.738
deep teal color to it.

2330
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:19.970
"This here will cure what ails ye.

2331
01:47:20.930 --> 01:47:23.522
"Immediately cleanse the body."

2332
01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.836
SAM: Of like poison, disease?

2333
01:47:27.836 --> 01:47:32.036
MATT: "Poisons, whatever's locked up your muscles,

2334
01:47:32.036 --> 01:47:34.030
"all sorts of fun stuff."

2335
01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:37.278
SAM: It's like it will restore you, sort of a thing?

2336
01:47:37.278 --> 01:47:39.928
MATT: "Something flashes in your face

2337
01:47:39.928 --> 01:47:41.244
"and you lose your eyesight.

2338
01:47:41.244 --> 01:47:42.730
"Brings it right back."

2339
01:47:42.730 --> 01:47:45.430
ASHLEY: Yeza, can you just look at it real quick?

2340
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:48.300
SAM: Yeza, do your thing.

2341
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:53.840
MATT: "I don't mean to intrude upon your place of business,

2342
01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.115
"I just--"

2343
01:47:56.739 --> 01:47:58.460
He watches, Turmin leans forward.

2344
01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:03.257
"Mm-hmm, go ahead. Check, little one."

2345
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.170
Yeza goes forward and uncorks each of the potions.

2346
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:13.037
The greater one, swirls it around.

2347
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.320
Picks one up, takes it, puts it down.

2348
01:48:21.610 --> 01:48:25.009
"Thank you Turmin--Mr. Turmin,"

2349
01:48:25.009 --> 01:48:27.777
and gets behind you and whispers in your ear,

2350
01:48:27.777 --> 01:48:30.050
"They all seem pretty legitimate."

2351
01:48:30.050 --> 01:48:32.420
SAM: Thank you. How much for everything?

2352
01:48:33.843 --> 01:48:35.880
MATT: "Ah, you want the whole package, I see?

2353
01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.090
"Well, let's see here."
Looks at this there.

2354
01:48:40.150 --> 01:48:42.533
"It'll be 1,000 gold--"

2355
01:48:42.533 --> 01:48:43.674
SAM: Aw, fuck!

2356
01:48:45.662 --> 01:48:47.895
MATT: "For the elixir of health."

2357
01:48:47.895 --> 01:48:49.211
ASHLEY: For just the one?

2358
01:48:49.211 --> 01:48:52.120
MATT: "For that one."
ASHLEY: For the teal one.

2359
01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:53.540
MATT: "Aye."

2360
01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:55.452
ASHLEY: We probably don't need that then.

2361
01:48:55.452 --> 01:48:57.240
What about the rest of them?

2362
01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:59.450
MATT: "Oh, you're going to be real sad when suddenly

2363
01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:04.253
"you find yourself turning to stone, maybe."

2364
01:49:05.507 --> 01:49:07.770
TRAVIS: Or paralyzed or blind or--

2365
01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:09.540
LAURA: We need a restoration.

2366
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:11.068
MATT: Yeza leans in your ear,

2367
01:49:11.068 --> 01:49:14.670
"I don't think it cures petrification."

2368
01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:16.970
SAM: Oh, thank you.

2369
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:19.890
ASHLEY: What about for everything?

2370
01:49:19.890 --> 01:49:22.100
Yes, if we got all of these things.

2371
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:25.870
If we're just feeling a little crazy.

2372
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:28.830
MATT: "That would be 1,700 gold pieces."

2373
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:30.940
ASHLEY: 1,700 gold pieces.

2374
01:49:31.781 --> 01:49:33.550
MATT: "700 for all the healing potions."

2375
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:35.410
SAM: Including the greater one?

2376
01:49:36.330 --> 01:49:38.475
MATT: "Including the greater one."

2377
01:49:38.475 --> 01:49:39.875
SAM: Okay, and 1,000 for the teal.

2378
01:49:39.875 --> 01:49:41.350
MATT: "For the Elixir of Health."

2379
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:46.895
ASHLEY: I mean I don't really have any money.

2380
01:49:46.895 --> 01:49:50.112
I haven't been here to collect.

2381
01:49:50.112 --> 01:49:53.671
(laughter)

2382
01:49:53.671 --> 01:49:55.338
TRAVIS: I don't think I've been putting money

2383
01:49:55.338 --> 01:49:56.671
in your profile.

2384
01:49:57.718 --> 01:50:00.215
ASHLEY: I do have money. I have a little money.

2385
01:50:00.215 --> 01:50:01.606
TALIESIN: You have a little money.

2386
01:50:01.606 --> 01:50:04.731
SAM: If we wanted to we could buy them all,

2387
01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:07.873
but we'll just one of the smaller

2388
01:50:07.873 --> 01:50:10.450
and one of the greaters and that's it.

2389
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:12.608
MATT: You watch as the boisterous grin

2390
01:50:12.608 --> 01:50:14.391
fades a bit, deflates.

2391
01:50:15.930 --> 01:50:19.153
"Right okay, well--"
SAM: How much is that?

2392
01:50:19.153 --> 01:50:22.720
MATT: "That will be 550."
SAM: 550 just for one of that

2393
01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.875
and one of that?

2394
01:50:23.875 --> 01:50:24.708
MATT: "Aye."

2395
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.850
ASHLEY: Wait, does that break down correctly?

2396
01:50:29.850 --> 01:50:32.220
SAM: That doesn't, the math is terrible.

2397
01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:35.089
ASHLEY: This Xhorhasian math is so weird.

2398
01:50:35.089 --> 01:50:36.547
MATT: These are 50 each.

2399
01:50:36.547 --> 01:50:38.345
SAM: They're only 50 and those are 500?

2400
01:50:38.345 --> 01:50:39.837
MATT: "Aye."
SAM: Wow.

2401
01:50:39.837 --> 01:50:41.807
Maybe the math does break down.

2402
01:50:43.826 --> 01:50:47.493
ASHLEY: What if we just pay 500 for both of those?

2403
01:50:48.505 --> 01:50:49.955
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2404
01:50:51.323 --> 01:50:53.148
ASHLEY: Hey, it's my first roll.

2405
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:55.356
TALIESIN: Welcome back.

2406
01:50:56.944 --> 01:50:58.750
ASHLEY: Oh, okay, hold on.

2407
01:50:58.750 --> 01:51:01.940
Oh shit, it's minus two. 15.

2408
01:51:08.101 --> 01:51:09.250
MATT: (sighs)

2409
01:51:09.250 --> 01:51:11.430
ASHLEY: Turmin, where are you from?

2410
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:13.971
MATT: "From here. Well--

2411
01:51:16.355 --> 01:51:17.830
"Yeah."

2412
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:21.990
ASHLEY: Where specifically if I may ask?

2413
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.823
MATT: "Here.

2414
01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:25.280
"I grew up here."
ASHLEY: You grew up here?

2415
01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:27.478
MATT: "Well, I grew up in the Shadowshire

2416
01:51:27.478 --> 01:51:28.753
and then eventually came--

2417
01:51:28.753 --> 01:51:30.286
SAM: What's that? Shadowshire,

2418
01:51:30.286 --> 01:51:32.440
what is that? What does that mean?

2419
01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.630
MATT: "Are you not from around here?"

2420
01:51:34.630 --> 01:51:36.650
SAM: I am, but my husband's not.

2421
01:51:36.650 --> 01:51:38.390
MATT: "Apparently."
SAM: He wants to know

2422
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:40.188
and he's too shy to ask.

2423
01:51:41.110 --> 01:51:42.817
ASHLEY: He's too shy to ask.

2424
01:51:42.817 --> 01:51:44.966
MATT: Yeza's like, "I think that's

2425
01:51:44.966 --> 01:51:46.840
"near where they were keeping me."

2426
01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:47.940
SAM: Oh, it's down under?

2427
01:51:49.050 --> 01:51:49.883
MATT: "Right."

2428
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:54.250
SAM: Are there many more of you down there?

2429
01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:55.750
Is there a whole civilization?

2430
01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:01.650
MATT: "Are you going to take it or go?"

2431
01:52:01.650 --> 01:52:04.137
ASHLEY: Did you say it was 500 for the both?

2432
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:07.761
MATT: "It was until your friend started peeping up."

2433
01:52:07.761 --> 01:52:10.008
LAURA: Oh no!

2434
01:52:11.008 --> 01:52:13.130
TALIESIN: The best.

2435
01:52:13.130 --> 01:52:16.005
LAURA: It's rain on Sam night.
SAM: That's all right.

2436
01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:20.661
I have the comfort of my imaginary husband.

2437
01:52:20.661 --> 01:52:23.000
(laughter)

2438
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.630
MATT: You feel a hand squeeze your shoulder.

2439
01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:27.983
SAM: Baby, at least you still care for me.

2440
01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.687
LIAM: Well, it only took four years.

2441
01:52:31.687 --> 01:52:34.980
(laughter)

2442
01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:37.430
ASHLEY: Okay, we'll take the greater and the--

2443
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:39.600
SAM: You want the greater?

2444
01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:41.372
ASHLEY: No, should we just get a bunch of the smaller ones?

2445
01:52:41.372 --> 01:52:42.922
SAM: All the littles, all the littles.

2446
01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:44.380
ASHLEY: We're going to get all the little ones.

2447
01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:47.206
SAM: Ignore the big, sorry, all the littles.

2448
01:52:47.206 --> 01:52:48.730
MATT: "Fine, fine, take it."

2449
01:52:48.730 --> 01:52:50.021
ASHLEY: 200?

2450
01:52:50.021 --> 01:52:51.414
MATT: "200 gold."

2451
01:52:51.414 --> 01:52:53.362
SAM: I've got this, Yasha, you don't have any money.

2452
01:52:53.362 --> 01:52:54.195
ASHLEY: I do have some, actually.

2453
01:52:54.195 --> 01:52:57.253
I have more than I thought I did. I'll put in 100.

2454
01:52:57.253 --> 01:52:59.478
SAM: Hey, that's great.

2455
01:52:59.478 --> 01:53:01.830
TALIESIN: Should we distribute these accordingly?

2456
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:03.810
Who needs one?

2457
01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:06.541
SAM: I do, I need two.

2458
01:53:06.541 --> 01:53:08.920
TALIESIN: A lot of people don't have one at all.

2459
01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.419
ASHLEY: Oh my god, these are great!

2460
01:53:10.419 --> 01:53:11.419
TALIESIN: Aren't they great?

2461
01:53:11.419 --> 01:53:12.901
LAURA: Aren't they cool?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2462
01:53:12.901 --> 01:53:17.080
TALIESIN: You get one. That one--

2463
01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:18.680
MARISHA: I still have one.

2464
01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:19.513
MATT: "You done?"

2465
01:53:19.513 --> 01:53:20.468
SAM: Yeah, I think we're done.

2466
01:53:20.468 --> 01:53:21.718
ASHLEY: Yes, I think we're done.

2467
01:53:21.718 --> 01:53:24.010
Thank you so much, Turmin. Oh wait!

2468
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:29.230
These herbs up here are any of them--

2469
01:53:29.230 --> 01:53:32.930
SAM: While she says that, I'm going to steal something.

2470
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:37.420
ASHLEY: These ones over here, are they good for tea?

2471
01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:39.903
MATT: "That over this way?"
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2472
01:53:39.903 --> 01:53:41.102
MATT: What are you going to steal?

2473
01:53:41.102 --> 01:53:42.918
SAM: What do I got, what's my options?

2474
01:53:42.918 --> 01:53:45.542
(laughter)

2475
01:53:45.542 --> 01:53:48.830
MATT: All right, he's pulled,

2476
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:51.510
he's taken the greater potion away, he's put that away.

2477
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:53.730
There is the potion of health, the 1,000 gold one,

2478
01:53:53.730 --> 01:53:55.490
but that is literally right in the middle.

2479
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:58.270
It's possible, but it's going to be a high DC.

2480
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:59.953
SAM: Poor. Yes.

2481
01:53:59.953 --> 01:54:02.244
LAURA: You could roll really high, though.

2482
01:54:02.244 --> 01:54:04.370
MATT: Around the chamber, there's all the various vials

2483
01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:06.786
that are labeled for--
SAM: Bullshit vials.

2484
01:54:06.786 --> 01:54:07.989
MATT: I mean, you don't know what they do necessarily.

2485
01:54:07.989 --> 01:54:09.339
Some of them might be, some of them might not be.

2486
01:54:09.339 --> 01:54:10.847
TRAVIS: Get some dick juice, go for it.

2487
01:54:10.847 --> 01:54:13.590
MATT: It's up to you.
ASHLEY: Get the dream one.

2488
01:54:13.590 --> 01:54:17.110
SAM: Yeah, I'll try for the dream one if it's around,

2489
01:54:17.110 --> 01:54:19.320
if he indicated it with--
MATT: It's a few feet behind.

2490
01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:22.169
You could begin to meander that way as you're leaving

2491
01:54:22.169 --> 01:54:23.289
and try for it. It's up to you.

2492
01:54:23.289 --> 01:54:26.874
SAM: I want to do something right now while he's distracted.

2493
01:54:26.874 --> 01:54:28.840
MATT: All right. Well, you have the two small crystal vials.

2494
01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:33.727
SAM: Of rhino sex?
MATT: Rhino sex, sure.

2495
01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:37.947
SAM: I'll go for those.
TALIESIN: Good call.

2496
01:54:37.947 --> 01:54:40.720
MATT: Go ahead and make a dexterity check

2497
01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.490
with your proficiency modifier.

2498
01:54:42.490 --> 01:54:45.820
SAM: Uh-huh, with proficiency, with sleight of hand?

2499
01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:47.490
MATT: Sorry, with sleight of head, this isn't proficiency--

2500
01:54:47.490 --> 01:54:49.610
SAM: 27.

2501
01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:52.760
MATT: Both of them gone.

2502
01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:54.251
SAM: Okay.

2503
01:54:54.251 --> 01:54:57.813
MATT: Like so fast he doesn't even remember they're there.

2504
01:54:57.813 --> 01:55:00.470
"I wouldn't recommend that for tea."

2505
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:01.303
ASHLEY: No, okay.

2506
01:55:01.303 --> 01:55:02.136
MATT: "No it'll burn through

2507
01:55:02.136 --> 01:55:03.560
"and you'll probably pump out most of your insides

2508
01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.750
"from your ass."
ASHLEY: Oh, I don't want that.

2509
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:10.550
Do you also happen to have--

2510
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:11.466
what is this called?

2511
01:55:11.466 --> 01:55:14.600
SAM: A straight razor.
ASHLEY: A straight razor?

2512
01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:18.680
MATT: "Why, you buying?"
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2513
01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.804
MATT: "I mean, I could sell you that."

2514
01:55:20.804 --> 01:55:23.700
ASHLEY: How much?
MATT: "Two gold."

2515
01:55:24.974 --> 01:55:28.590
ASHLEY: One gold.
TALIESIN: Wow.

2516
01:55:28.590 --> 01:55:31.940
MATT: "Deal."

2517
01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:34.848
SAM: 50% discount, amazing!

2518
01:55:34.848 --> 01:55:36.800
TRAVIS: A straight razor's one gold.

2519
01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.379
LIAM: Right, here's $300.

2520
01:55:39.379 --> 01:55:41.704
SAM: Thank you, Mr. Turmin.

2521
01:55:41.704 --> 01:55:43.660
MATT: He goes and leaves for a second.

2522
01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:48.970
About a minute passes and then he comes back

2523
01:55:48.970 --> 01:55:50.470
after rummaging and produces

2524
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:51.980
the straight razor and hands it down.

2525
01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:54.213
ASHLEY: Thank you very much.

2526
01:55:54.213 --> 01:55:55.700
MATT: "Thank you."
SAM: Let's get out of here.

2527
01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:57.650
ASHLEY: We're going to go.

2528
01:55:57.650 --> 01:55:58.816
Good-bye, Turmin.

2529
01:55:58.816 --> 01:56:00.449
MATT: "Good-bye."

2530
01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:04.940
SAM: All right, we're going to find you fuckers.

2531
01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:06.965
TALIESIN: We have all had a day.

2532
01:56:06.965 --> 01:56:09.973
MARISHA: Pick up paper on the way, I guess. You want paper?

2533
01:56:09.973 --> 01:56:11.960
LIAM: Yeah, I want paper. I thought we were going to get

2534
01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.080
some at the library. I thought I could work that angle,

2535
01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:17.570
but it did not come up. Let's get some paper.

2536
01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:18.970
MATT: Yeah, we'll say for the purposes of ease

2537
01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:20.710
that you're able to pick a paper that you need to.

2538
01:56:20.710 --> 01:56:22.318
LIAM: High quality paper and--?

2539
01:56:22.318 --> 01:56:24.190
MATT: Yeah, you can get some high quality paper and ink.

2540
01:56:24.190 --> 01:56:26.900
Probably not--no, you could probably in the Firmaments.

2541
01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:29.391
Not far from the Marble Tomes Conservatory,

2542
01:56:29.391 --> 01:56:30.674
you can find some.

2543
01:56:30.674 --> 01:56:32.149
So as much paper as you're willing to purchase

2544
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:34.848
of high quality that you need. You can do that.

2545
01:56:34.848 --> 01:56:36.231
LIAM: <i>Danke.</i>

2546
01:56:36.231 --> 01:56:37.500

MARISHA: They all float, don't we here?

2549
01:56:44.448 --> 01:56:49.425
MATT: All righty, so as you guys gather up to reconvene

2550
01:56:50.592 --> 01:56:52.900
to discuss what you've done, what you need

2551
01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:56.760
and what the next plotting and plan is for your venture,

2552

MATT: It's a shopping episode.

2556
01:57:05.683 --> 01:57:07.016
You guys wanted to do some shopping.

01:57:07.016 --> 01:57:09.255

That will go on to one of our lucky winners.

More than once you'll be disqualified

2577

joining us. Normally they interrupt or are ready

02:05:10.887 --> 02:05:12.430
to hear that, Liam.
BRIAN: Liam, you were not

2716
02:05:12.430 --> 02:05:14.540
supposed to hear that.

2717
02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.673
SAM: This is going to be so awkward later

2718
02:05:16.673 --> 02:05:20.045
at bedtime tonight.

2719
02:05:20.045 --> 02:05:21.588
TALIESIN: You remembered to talk about the notebook, right?

2720
02:05:21.588 --> 02:05:25.821
BRIAN: Jesus Christ, Taliesin,

2721
02:05:25.821 --> 02:05:27.404
we just talked about the notebook.

2722
02:05:27.404 --> 02:05:29.260
TALIESIN: Okay, because I didn't see

2723
02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:30.280
you talk about the notebook.

2724
02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:33.060
BRIANL I gave it away for GIF of the Week.

2725
02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:34.270
TALIESIN: But did you talk about it?

2726
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:36.310
BRIAN: I talked about it, I smelled it.

2727
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:38.992
We showed it to New Greg. We showed it to Steve.

2728
02:05:38.992 --> 02:05:41.548
We showed it to Old Greg.

2729
02:05:41.548 --> 02:05:42.780
TALIESIN: Yeah, no okay, as long as--

2730
02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:44.020
that's good.
BRIAN: No, it's fine.

2731
02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:45.650
Thank you, Taliesin.
TALIESIN: No, I just wanted

2732
02:05:45.650 --> 02:05:47.670
to make you know.
DANI: You actually look

2733
02:05:47.670 --> 02:05:49.300
really nice in that light.
TALIESIN: Thank you,

2734
02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:50.133
thank you very much.

2735
02:05:50.133 --> 02:05:52.249
BRIAN: Just bring us some of that cake

2736
02:05:52.249 --> 02:05:53.617
you're baking out there whenever it's done.

2737
02:05:53.617 --> 02:05:54.450
TALIESIN: I just wanted to make sure

2738
02:05:54.450 --> 02:05:56.410
you knew how to do your job.
BRIAN: Yeah, no I don't, but--

2739
02:05:56.410 --> 02:05:57.243
TALIESIN: Yeah, you'll get there.

2740
02:05:57.243 --> 02:05:58.076
BRIAN: Thank god.

2741
02:05:58.076 --> 02:05:58.910
MATT: Thank you, buddy.
TALIESIN: Bye.

2742
02:05:58.910 --> 02:06:01.000
BRIAN: So many quality control people here.

2743
02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:01.900
Yeah, go get him.
MATT: I was hoping someone

2744
02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:04.260
was going to step in. I'm glad that worked out, yeah.

2745
02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:06.026
BRIAN: The D&amp;D pantheon.

2747
02:06:06.869 --> 02:06:10.402

02:06:14.010 --> 02:06:15.940
Chris Willmott's going to drive his car

2750

through the goddamn wall in a second and go, "My bad, gang!"

2751

(laughter)

2752
02:06:28.694 --> 02:06:31.900
That's all the time we--

2753
02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:35.475
What?
SAM: Oh my fucking god.

2754
02:06:35.475 --> 02:06:39.550
TRAVIS: Sorry, my wallet is in there.

2755
02:06:39.550 --> 02:06:41.549
Somewhere I think it's--

2756
02:06:41.549 --> 02:06:45.750
BRIAN: If that baby walks in here in five minutes--

2757
02:06:46.781 --> 02:06:47.897
MATT: I can help you!

2758
02:06:47.897 --> 02:06:49.180
SAM: So much yee-haw.

2759
02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:50.023
MATT: Oh it's right over here.

2760
02:06:50.023 --> 02:06:52.731
I found it, there it is, there's your wallet,

2761
02:06:52.731 --> 02:06:54.299
it's in your pocket.

2762
02:06:54.299 --> 02:06:56.110
BRIAN: It was in your pocket the whole time.

2763
02:06:56.110 --> 02:06:59.053
Who would have known? Are you good?

2764
02:06:59.053 --> 02:07:00.444
TRAVIS: Are y'all doing anything?

2765
02:07:00.444 --> 02:07:01.680
MATT: Not any more.

2766
02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.310
BRIAN: I was just about to compliment Sam

2767
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:05.980
and I've changed my mind, so I'm glad you walked in.

2768
02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:08.434
That's a good shot.
SAM: That is a new table.

2769
02:07:08.434 --> 02:07:09.809
TRAVIS: When does Talks start?

2770
02:07:09.809 --> 02:07:11.934
BRIAN: It's going to start probably in like--

2771
02:07:11.934 --> 02:07:13.840
tell me the top three you would never say

2772
02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:15.660
if we were live on Talks Machina.

2773
02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:19.080
TRAVIS: Well, I'd probably--hey, Steve.

2774
02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:21.720
BRIAN: Ignore the red light above that camera

2775
02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:24.810
and instead--
TRAVIS: Sorry sorry sorry!

2776
02:07:24.810 --> 02:07:28.938
BRIAN: Fetch me another drink.

2777
02:07:30.836 --> 02:07:33.202
(snickers)
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

2778
02:07:33.202 --> 02:07:37.284
MATT: What the hell?! This is ridiculous.

2779
02:07:37.284 --> 02:07:38.418
TRAVIS: You guys are crazy.

2780
02:07:38.418 --> 02:07:43.125
We did it, you did it, $8.8 million.

2781
02:07:43.125 --> 02:07:44.810
That was our final stretch goal

2782
02:07:44.810 --> 02:07:46.400
for the Legend of Vox Machina

2783
02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:50.630
you are getting all ten episodes of this animated series.

2784
02:07:50.630 --> 02:07:53.021
SAM: The full Briarwoods arc.

2785
02:07:53.021 --> 02:07:55.471
TALIESIN: Oh, Whitestone!

2786
02:07:55.471 --> 02:07:58.026
SAM: The campaign still has two weeks left to go.

2787
02:07:58.026 --> 02:07:59.206
TRAVIS: Yeah, 13 days left.

2788
02:07:59.206 --> 02:08:01.969
SAM: Anything past this just gets added into

2789
02:08:01.969 --> 02:08:05.620
the budget of the episodes to make them cooler

2790
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:08.020
to make the animation more amazing,

2791
02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:10.830
to make the fight sequences that more--

2792
02:08:10.830 --> 02:08:12.420
LAURA: More fighty.

2793
02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:13.910
TRAVIS: We're going to pump it full

2794
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:17.000
of all the effects, all the colors, all the fight moves,

2795
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.500
all the everything.

2796
02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:19.510
MARISHA: All that vocal talent.

2797
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:22.030
LAURA: And we get to play a game DMed by Ashley.

2798
02:08:22.030 --> 02:08:25.870
TRAVIS: That's right. Unlocked Ashley's one shot,

2799
02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:28.240
finally after three and a half years.

2800
02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:31.184
MATT: Yeah, it's about time.

2801
02:08:31.184 --> 02:08:32.990
SAM: You guys have defied all the expectations

2802
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:36.880
and surprised the world so thank you so much.

2803
02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:40.320
And thanks for surprising us and for being awesome.

2804
02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:42.070
LIAM: You guys are unstoppable.

2805
02:08:42.070 --> 02:08:43.760
TRAVIS: Yeah, keep spreading the love. We love you guys

2806
02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:45.740
more than anything. This is a dream for us

2807
02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:50.730
and you have made it a reality, so thank you so much.

2808
02:08:50.730 --> 02:08:52.158
We'll see you guys in 14 days.

02:09:08.746 --> 02:09:13.620
DANI: (sighs) I just want to watch my Critical Role.

2814
02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:15.587
TALIESIN: For your consideration,

2815
02:09:15.587 --> 02:09:16.803
this is the face of a critter

2816
02:09:16.803 --> 02:09:19.500
who's craving their Critical Role content.

2817
02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:22.370
But for that sanctimonious shipper, time misled them

2818
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:25.050
like a trip to the Feywild and now they have come

2819
02:09:25.050 --> 02:09:27.700
face to face with existential dread,

2820
02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:30.983
a fear of sardonic spoilers.

2821
02:09:30.983 --> 02:09:33.080
Let us lead them across the bridge into a realm

2822
02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:36.540
of bright shadows where even if one misses the live viewing

2823
02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:38.840
of their favorite program they can still

2824
02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:41.080
watch it on demand if they bear the mark

2825
02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:43.810
of a Twitch subscription to the channel.

made by the sage, Arsequeef. In this land of shadow

We'll get that Wyrmwood to you ASAP.

SAM: It's custom made for Laura Bailey.

2851
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:48.779
LAURA: It is and they put The Bailey Brig on the bottom.

2852

TALIESIN: So pretty.

2861

MATT: All right then, guys.

2862
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:15.630
You all make your way back

2863
02:24:15.630 --> 02:24:20.630
to the Dim's Inn to convene and discuss what has transpired.

2864
02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:25.410
One by one, you've all found your way back to it.

into the city probably, if at all.

2870
02:24:42.610 --> 02:24:44.050
Nevertheless, you all find yourselves

2871
02:24:44.050 --> 02:24:47.030
together at the Dim's Inn.

2872
02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:51.130
SAM: That's amazing, what you just told us

2873
02:24:51.130 --> 02:24:53.550
about your encounter at the library.

2874
02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:56.790
MARISHA: Right, I told you you'd love it.

2875

SAM: Wow!

2876
02:24:57.623 --> 02:24:58.456
TALIESIN: Could you repeat some of that? I wasn't

2877
02:24:58.456 --> 02:25:00.000
paying attention.
SAM: And the dick

2878
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.430
and you drew the dick, too.

2879
02:25:01.430 --> 02:25:04.260
MARISHA: I drew a dick, I only got one dick in.

2881
02:25:06.317 --> 02:25:09.520
SAM: It's all we can ever hope for.

2882
02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:13.075

SAM: Oh Caleb, she's been carrying that straight razor

2885
02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:22.119
around in her pocket.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2886
02:25:22.119 --> 02:25:24.670
SAM: Ah ah.
TALIESIN: Pass the mime.

2887
02:25:26.073 --> 02:25:31.073
LIAM: Oh, that is sharp and not real. Thank you very much.

2888
02:25:31.312 --> 02:25:32.228
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

2889
02:25:32.228 --> 02:25:33.511
LIAM: Perfect. But you're still

2890
02:25:33.511 --> 02:25:36.480
going to give me one more traditional shave.

2891
02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:38.380
ASHLEY: Yes.
LIAM: For old time's sake.

2892
02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:39.610
ASHLEY: I would love to.
LIAM: All right.

2893
02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:44.430
ASHLEY: Yeah, but now you can just spruce it up in between--

2894
02:25:44.430 --> 02:25:46.482
LIAM: After today.
ASHLEY: --with your sharp...

2895
02:25:46.482 --> 02:25:48.670
shaver.

2896
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:51.153
LAURA: Which of the items do you think we'll take?

2897
02:25:51.153 --> 02:25:52.769
MARISHA: Well, I don't know.

2898
02:25:52.769 --> 02:25:56.800
The staff seemed fancy for someone like Caduceus,

2899
02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:59.420
the robe seemed fancy for someone like Caleb

2900
02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:01.490
and the ring seemed fancy for anyone.

2901
02:26:01.490 --> 02:26:03.940
LIAM: Anyone.
LAURA: Yeah.

2902
02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:05.920
TALIESIN: Wow.
SAM: Do we have to decide now?

2903
02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:07.490
MARISHA: and LIAM: No.

2904
02:26:07.490 --> 02:26:09.820
SAM: But we have to go on this mission?

2905
02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:11.610
MARISHA: She wants us to kill some giants.

2906
02:26:11.610 --> 02:26:15.150
LIAM: Kill some giants and humiliate a rival.

2907
02:26:15.150 --> 02:26:16.350
MARISHA: Foreman Bodo.

2908
02:26:16.350 --> 02:26:17.920
TRAVIS: How many giants?

2909
02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:19.520
TALIESIN: Four men named Bodo.

2910
02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:20.361
MARISHA: She didn't really specify

2911
02:26:20.361 --> 02:26:21.970
how many giants, I think it's going to take a bit

2912
02:26:21.970 --> 02:26:22.803
of a stakeout.

2913
02:26:22.803 --> 02:26:25.250
ASHLEY: Wait, what was the other item, though?

2914
02:26:25.250 --> 02:26:26.810
You said there was a--
LIAM: There was a robe,

2915
02:26:26.810 --> 02:26:29.390
a ring, a staff with a withered claw at the top

2916
02:26:29.390 --> 02:26:32.730
there was a broken sword which we don't know anything about.

2917
02:26:32.730 --> 02:26:35.739
MARISHA: And that's it.
ASHLEY: Okay.

2918
02:26:35.739 --> 02:26:39.588
SAM: That would put us in better favor with the Dynasty.

2919
02:26:39.588 --> 02:26:42.596
LAURA: But it would also ensure

2920
02:26:42.596 --> 02:26:45.888
that a lot more Empire people would die, right?

2921
02:26:45.888 --> 02:26:47.337
SAM: Why so?

2922
02:26:47.337 --> 02:26:49.979
LAURA: Because she's making war machines.

2923
02:26:49.979 --> 02:26:52.230
LIAM: Well, so is the competitor.

2924
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:54.683
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: It is true.

2925
02:26:54.683 --> 02:26:57.060
SAM: It would unlock knowledge, right?

2926
02:26:57.060 --> 02:26:59.370
We were told that she and the library contain

2927
02:26:59.370 --> 02:27:01.090
knowledge about the Dynasty?

2928
02:27:01.090 --> 02:27:02.820
MARISHA: The library looks like it contains a lot

2929
02:27:02.820 --> 02:27:07.380
of really awesome information.
SAM: That we could use.

2930
02:27:07.380 --> 02:27:09.830
TALIESIN: We're in a new ecosystem and we have to adapt.

2931
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:14.002
MARISHA: She understandably didn't fully trust us.

2932
02:27:14.002 --> 02:27:16.590
SAM: So far our best option.

2933
02:27:16.590 --> 02:27:18.600
Well, our most powerful ally

2934
02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:21.100
potentially is this Bright Queen.

2935
02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:23.430
LIAM: Yes, war is going to be made

2936
02:27:23.430 --> 02:27:27.200
regardless, with or without us, and the hope is

2937
02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:31.590
to use what we learn here on our new friends

2938
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:36.080
to enact some sort of change at home.

2939
02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:39.861
SAM: Then we have to keep playing this game.

2940
02:27:39.861 --> 02:27:40.694
LAURA: We have to kill some fucking giants.

2941
02:27:40.694 --> 02:27:41.910
MARISHA and SAM: Yeah.

2942
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:43.840
LAURA: What kind of giants? Fiery ones,

2943
02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:45.340
like the ones we saw underground?

2944
02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:47.500
Because those were serious, you guys,

2945
02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:48.930
I don't think we could kill those.

2946
02:27:48.930 --> 02:27:50.450
MARISHA: She mentioned them normally staying up

2947
02:27:50.450 --> 02:27:52.610
in the mountains and in the hills

2948
02:27:52.610 --> 02:27:54.020
and then they would--
LAURA: So hill giants.

2949
02:27:54.020 --> 02:27:55.760
MARISHA: I think so and then for some reason

2950
02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:57.100
they're in the middle of this forest

2951
02:27:57.100 --> 02:28:01.558
where their thing is.

2952
02:28:01.558 --> 02:28:03.956
What's it called?

2953
02:28:03.956 --> 02:28:06.431
A mining camp.

2954
02:28:06.431 --> 02:28:07.429
What's it called?

2955
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:08.262
TRAVIS: Deepriver Mining Camp.

2956
02:28:08.262 --> 02:28:09.200
LIAM: You're the note person.

2957
02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:10.033
TRAVIS: Shaft.

2958
02:28:10.033 --> 02:28:12.233
MARISHA: Shaft. Mining shaft.
TRAVIS: That's the shaft.

2959
02:28:12.233 --> 02:28:16.767
LIAM: The Deepriver Mining--
LAURA: It's a big shaft.

2960
02:28:16.767 --> 02:28:17.600
It's a big one.

2961
02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:20.063
ASHLEY: Did she say what forest?

2962
02:28:20.063 --> 02:28:24.090
MARISHA: The Vermaloc?

2963
02:28:24.090 --> 02:28:26.766
LAURA: Is that a lake, like loch like lake?

2964
02:28:26.766 --> 02:28:28.650
LIAM: The Vermaloc and the Penumbra meet.

2965
02:28:28.650 --> 02:28:31.810
ASHLEY: That's where all the purple wood comes from.

2966
02:28:31.810 --> 02:28:33.410
TALIESIN: Really?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2967
02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:34.560
TALIESIN: I'd like to see that.

2968
02:28:36.515 --> 02:28:38.690
TRAVIS: The purple wood that we see around here so much?

2969
02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:41.323
ASHLEY: Comes from those forests.

2970
02:28:41.323 --> 02:28:43.289
TRAVIS: ♪ Purple wood ♪

2971
02:28:43.289 --> 02:28:45.489
ALL: ♪ Purple wood ♪

2972
02:28:45.489 --> 02:28:47.703
SAM: Well, should we set out? What time of day is it?

2973
02:28:47.703 --> 02:28:49.040
MATT: At this point, if you guys know how to travel,

2974
02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:50.810
you'd gather it's probably early afternoon

2975
02:28:50.810 --> 02:28:54.690
from all of your shopping, though it is still dark.

2976
02:28:54.690 --> 02:28:56.470
LAURA: I wonder if it's dark over

2977
02:28:56.470 --> 02:28:59.170
by the forest or if it's light.

2978
02:28:59.170 --> 02:29:01.090
We would leave the pocket of night.

2979
02:29:01.090 --> 02:29:03.710
TALIESIN: You would know.

2980
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:04.660
LIAM: I don't know that I would.

2981
02:29:04.660 --> 02:29:06.370
LAURA: Yasha might know.
LIAM: Looking at the giant

2982
02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:08.220
bubble of darkness around here.

2983
02:29:08.220 --> 02:29:09.770
MATT: You're not sure.
LIAM: I know what time it is,

2984
02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:11.540
but I don't know what the properties of what they're doing.

2985
02:29:11.540 --> 02:29:14.369
MATT: Correct. It looks night.

2986
02:29:14.369 --> 02:29:15.560
TALIESIN: Well, if we're going to be taking off,

2987
02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:18.630
I would recommend then what would possibly

2988
02:29:18.630 --> 02:29:22.290
be the right thing to do is to load up some travel,

2989
02:29:22.290 --> 02:29:26.792
travel some food, water, some basics,

2990
02:29:26.792 --> 02:29:30.683
maybe some slightly less conspicuous clothing

2991
02:29:30.683 --> 02:29:32.541
and something warm.

2992
02:29:32.541 --> 02:29:34.524
LAURA: Go buy some new dresses.

2993
02:29:34.524 --> 02:29:39.428
TALIESIN: And leave first thing early in--I miss the sun.

2994
02:29:40.297 --> 02:29:42.307
LIAM: Once we've slept, yeah, once we've slept.

2995
02:29:42.307 --> 02:29:44.220
ASHLEY: I feel like it's only dark here.

2996
02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:46.836
I've never been here before, but I heard that

2997
02:29:46.836 --> 02:29:49.220
this place was always dark, but just here.

2998
02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:50.940
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: By design.

2999
02:29:50.940 --> 02:29:52.740
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3000
02:29:54.190 --> 02:29:55.690
LIAM: Well, that's what we'll do,

3001
02:29:55.690 --> 02:29:56.730
what Caduceus has suggested,

3002
02:29:56.730 --> 02:29:58.380
unless anyone has any objections.

3003
02:29:58.380 --> 02:30:00.850
We can make sure that we are ready in all the ways

3004
02:30:00.850 --> 02:30:05.400
that we need to be and sleep a predetermined amount of time.

3005
02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:07.083
TALIESIN: Pack, sleep, and head out

3006
02:30:07.083 --> 02:30:07.983
first thing in the morning.

3007
02:30:07.983 --> 02:30:09.080
MARISHA: Clothes shopping.

3008
02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:10.670
LAURA: Let's go buy some clothes.

3009
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:12.911
We don't have to play it out,

3010
02:30:12.911 --> 02:30:14.486
but we just want to buy some new clothes.

3011
02:30:14.486 --> 02:30:15.800
MARISHA: We do it.

3012
02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:19.180
MATT: You guys can purchase for each of you

3013
02:30:19.180 --> 02:30:24.040
an outfit of the Dynasty, a general piece of clothing,

3014
02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:26.090
unless you want to spend a little extra.

3015
02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:28.839
The general outfit will cost each of you

3016
02:30:28.839 --> 02:30:32.790
given your status and the object you carry,

3017
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:35.370
the medallion, I'd say

3018
02:30:37.637 --> 02:30:41.812
about a gold piece each.

3019
02:30:41.812 --> 02:30:44.210
SAM: How about for the extra?

3020
02:30:44.210 --> 02:30:45.951
MATT: The extra? Three.

3021
02:30:45.951 --> 02:30:49.526
LAURA, SAM, and MARISHA: I'll go extra.

3022
02:30:49.526 --> 02:30:51.470
TALIESIN: Man, why even bother?

3023
02:30:51.470 --> 02:30:53.440
Then just some sundries so that we don't

3024
02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:55.770
have to have food spells up all the time.

3025
02:30:55.770 --> 02:30:58.031
MATT: Yeah, you can get supplies.

3026
02:30:58.031 --> 02:31:00.030
Like I said, the food here is heartier

3027
02:31:00.030 --> 02:31:03.050
and is less colorful, but you know how to spice

3028
02:31:03.050 --> 02:31:07.043
and flavor things of a vegetative nature.

3029
02:31:07.043 --> 02:31:08.740
TALIESIN: If I buy everything I need for--

3030
02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:11.430
how much travel is this going to be?

3031
02:31:11.430 --> 02:31:15.110
LIAM: I also, just to remind you, I have this jar

3032
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:17.080
from inside the happy fun ball that is full of

3033
02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:20.770
these little bobas and these will feed you for a day.

3034
02:31:20.770 --> 02:31:23.107
TALIESIN: We have a jar of boba?

3035
02:31:23.107 --> 02:31:24.940
LIAM: They are beads of nourishment.

3036
02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:26.031
SAM: Oh!

3037
02:31:26.031 --> 02:31:27.850
TALIESIN: Good to have it.

3038
02:31:27.850 --> 02:31:29.650
LIAM: That's a lot, it's like a gumball machine.

3039
02:31:29.650 --> 02:31:31.518
What's a gumball machine?

3040
02:31:31.518 --> 02:31:32.970
LAURA: And the bobas will feed us for a whole day?

3041
02:31:32.970 --> 02:31:34.222
LIAM: Yes.

3042
02:31:34.222 --> 02:31:35.610
LAURA: One boba?
LIAM: Yeah.

3043
02:31:35.610 --> 02:31:37.880
SAM, LAURA, TALIESIN, and ASHLEY: Wow!

3044
02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:40.230
TRAVIS: What else do we have that we've forgotten about?

3045
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:41.540
SAM: Probably a lot.

3046
02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:46.540
LIAM: Manacles, I have some very special manacles, yes.

3047
02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:51.028
TALIESIN: For the purple wood, let me know--

3048
02:31:51.028 --> 02:31:53.603
I can't help it, goddamn it--

3049
02:31:53.603 --> 02:31:55.200
how much to just enough provisions

3050
02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:58.020
for like ten days if that seems reasonable?

3051
02:31:58.020 --> 02:32:01.542
MATT: Ten days worth of provisions for the entire group?

3052
02:32:04.379 --> 02:32:06.991
TALIESIN: So I can keep everyone well fed.

3053
02:32:06.991 --> 02:32:08.550
SAM: We have boba.

3054
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:11.172
TALIESIN: If we want something other than boba.

3055
02:32:11.172 --> 02:32:12.505
ASHLEY: How much boba is in there?

3056
02:32:12.505 --> 02:32:13.504
SAM: Who doesn't like boba?

3057
02:32:13.504 --> 02:32:18.504
LIAM: Let's say that's 400 boba.

3058
02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:21.629
TALIESIN: Whoever guesses the correct amount of boba--

3059
02:32:21.629 --> 02:32:22.462
MATT: I'd say--

3060
02:32:22.462 --> 02:32:25.361
TRAVIS: Wins an ice cream party.

3061
02:32:26.610 --> 02:32:28.710
MATT: For all of you, it takes about two gold

3062
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:33.540
to feed the group per day on just modest meal costs.

3063
02:32:33.540 --> 02:32:37.210
Like for the entire group, not each for the entire group.

3064
02:32:37.210 --> 02:32:38.630
LAURA: Oh oh oh.

3065
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:41.140
MATT: So for ten days, put yourself at about 20 gold.

3066
02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:45.110
TALIESIN: I'll just put it at 25 for slightly better stuff,

3067
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:47.640
just higher quality just to have it.

3068
02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:48.902
MATT: Sure, yeah, I'll allow it.

3069
02:32:48.902 --> 02:32:50.773
SAM: Prosciutto.

3070
02:32:50.773 --> 02:32:53.320
LAURA and MARISHA: Some brie!

3071
02:32:53.320 --> 02:32:55.178
LIAM: Charcuterie.

3072
02:32:55.178 --> 02:32:56.703
LAURA: Oh, I just flashed back to our brunches.

3073
02:32:56.703 --> 02:32:58.874
MARISHA: I know, I want it so bad!

3074
02:32:58.874 --> 02:33:00.020
TALIESIN: Got it.
SAM: There's nothing

3075
02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:01.580
preventing you from having brunch together.

3076
02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:04.247
LAURA: I know, but D&amp;D brunches?

3077
02:33:05.202 --> 02:33:07.928
MARISHA: Remember D&amp;D brunch? Lox and bagels and--

3078
02:33:07.928 --> 02:33:09.169
LIAM: For one of our games, we should have lox and bagels

3079
02:33:09.169 --> 02:33:10.940
at the table.
MATT: All come in our pajamas

3080
02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:13.170
and do like a Thursday night brunch.

3081
02:33:13.170 --> 02:33:14.760
LIAM: A throwback.
MATT: That'd be pretty fun.

3082
02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:16.661
LIAM: A throwback night.
MATT: I'd like that.

3083
02:33:16.661 --> 02:33:18.912
LIAM: Wear pajamas.

3084
02:33:18.912 --> 02:33:21.470
MARISHA: Pajamas!

3085
02:33:21.470 --> 02:33:25.670
We could our nerdy head gear that we sometimes did.

3086
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:27.380
Or I did.

3087
02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:29.846
TALIESIN: We'll do a throwback.

3088
02:33:29.846 --> 02:33:31.849
SAM: All right.

3089
02:33:31.849 --> 02:33:34.830
We're going to rest, shop for awesome outfits.

3090
02:33:34.830 --> 02:33:36.940
MATT: Cool, you get yourself some food,

3091
02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:38.430
you're taking a full night's rest?

3092
02:33:38.430 --> 02:33:39.650
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think leave in the morning.

3093
02:33:39.650 --> 02:33:41.618
LAURA: Yeah, leave in the morning.

3094
02:33:41.618 --> 02:33:43.120
MATT: Okay. Outfits are purchased, food is purchased,

3095
02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:45.110
you guys have your provisions and the things you believe

3096
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:47.080
are necessary for this journey.

3097
02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:50.020
If you want to ask around to get an idea

3098
02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:52.270
of the distance you're traveling,

3099
02:33:52.270 --> 02:33:55.070
it's a little over a 60 mile journey.

3100
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.980
MARISHA: Ooh.
SAM: That's not bad.

3101
02:33:55.980 --> 02:33:58.943
We have these moorbounders.

3102
02:33:58.943 --> 02:34:00.493
LIAM: Not bad.

3103
02:34:00.493 --> 02:34:03.790
MATT: With the moorbounders traveling at max pace,

3104
02:34:03.790 --> 02:34:07.170
it'll take you just over a day, so a day and change

3105
02:34:07.170 --> 02:34:09.300
of travel to get there. Which isn't too bad.

3106
02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:13.335
TALIESIN: Max pace might be, let's be gentle.

3107
02:34:13.335 --> 02:34:14.364
MARISHA: Medium pace?

3108
02:34:14.364 --> 02:34:18.026
TALIESIN: I want to-- Stop it. (laughs)

3109
02:34:18.026 --> 02:34:20.150
TRAVIS: Unless the Dynasty had a transportation circle they

3110
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:22.218
wanted to let us use or something.

3111
02:34:22.218 --> 02:34:23.293
LAURA: But we have moorbounders.

3112
02:34:23.293 --> 02:34:24.126
TALIESIN: I want to take a look

3113
02:34:24.126 --> 02:34:26.460
at the surrounding area. I'd like to get a sense of

3114
02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:29.359
where we are and what this place looks like.

3115
02:34:29.359 --> 02:34:32.960
LAURA: You can ride Yarnball. You can ride with me, Fjord.

3116
02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:36.480
SAM: Yeza, I think you should stay here.

3117
02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:41.223
MATT: "I am, uh," and you see he looks conflicted

3118
02:34:41.223 --> 02:34:44.131
for a minute. He goes like, "I'm--

3119
02:34:44.131 --> 02:34:46.468
"I don't know where you're going and it sounds dangerous

3120
02:34:46.468 --> 02:34:51.409
"and I'm definitely not as skilled as you

3121
02:34:51.409 --> 02:34:54.530
at these things and your friends.

3122
02:34:54.530 --> 02:34:59.521
"I also really hate being alone right now.

3123
02:35:01.303 --> 02:35:03.420
"So I don't know what to do."

3124
02:35:03.420 --> 02:35:05.436
LIAM: What if you had some pets?

3125
02:35:05.436 --> 02:35:07.078
Would that be different or the same?

3126
02:35:07.078 --> 02:35:09.561
MATT: "That could help.

3127
02:35:09.561 --> 02:35:11.923
"You have pets?"

3128
02:35:11.923 --> 02:35:14.114
LAURA: Well, I do have Nugget.

3129
02:35:16.681 --> 02:35:17.947
MATT: "Can I--can I--"

3130
02:35:17.947 --> 02:35:20.420
LAURA: Of course you can, he's very friendly.

3131
02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:23.111
MATT: Reaches out to pet Nugget and Nugget suddenly goes,

3132
02:35:23.111 --> 02:35:25.103
"Huh?" and vanishes.

3133
02:35:25.103 --> 02:35:28.850
He's like, "Oh," and it appears next to him

3134
02:35:28.850 --> 02:35:30.930
and is licking his hand (slobbers)

3135
02:35:30.930 --> 02:35:35.930
"Oh, oh gosh, that helps, yeah."

3136
02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:37.471
LAURA: Um.

3137
02:35:37.471 --> 02:35:38.720
LIAM: She has a weasel as well.

3138
02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:40.980
LAURA: Why are you offering up all my awesome pets?

3139
02:35:40.980 --> 02:35:42.810
SAM: It's my husband!

3140
02:35:42.810 --> 02:35:45.419
He's lonely; give him your weasel!

3141
02:35:45.419 --> 02:35:48.336
(laughter)

3142
02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:54.440
LAURA: Sprinkle.
SAM: This is a ferret.

3143
02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:57.070
LAURA: No, it's a weasel.
SAM: It's the same thing.

3144
02:35:58.519 --> 02:36:02.030
LAURA: You have to keep him next to you all the time,

3145
02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:03.170
you have to keep him on your neck

3146
02:36:03.170 --> 02:36:05.800
because he needs it for warmth.

3147
02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:07.320
MATT: "Okay, I can try that."

3148
02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:09.400
LAURA: Feed him whatever you're eating.

3149
02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:12.310
He likes the crumbs of all sorts of things.

3150
02:36:12.310 --> 02:36:13.143
MATT: "Okay, hi."

3151
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:16.470
LAURA: And--?
MATT: "Sprinkle."

3152
02:36:16.470 --> 02:36:19.706
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "I mean, whoa whoa whoa!

3153
02:36:19.706 --> 02:36:20.914
(nervous laughter)

3154
02:36:20.914 --> 02:36:22.030
LAURA: He pees on you, be careful.

3155
02:36:22.030 --> 02:36:26.313
MATT: "Yeah, I see that. Okay.

3156
02:36:26.313 --> 02:36:27.888
"Well, that's better.

3157
02:36:27.888 --> 02:36:30.171
TALIESIN: We'll check in, too.

3158
02:36:30.171 --> 02:36:33.340
LAURA: Yeah, don't let Nugget blink away too much, okay?

3159
02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:34.850
He needs to stay near you.

3160
02:36:34.850 --> 02:36:39.430
MATT: "How do I that?"
LAURA: You say...

3161
02:36:39.430 --> 02:36:42.654
SAM: She's not trained it at all.

3162
02:36:42.654 --> 02:36:44.736
LAURA: You might want to train him a little bit.

3163
02:36:44.736 --> 02:36:46.470
I forget to train--

3164
02:36:46.470 --> 02:36:48.030
SAM: Maybe that could be a project for you.

3165
02:36:48.030 --> 02:36:50.300
MATT: "Yeah, sure, I've never--"

3166
02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:52.640
LAURA: I think I told him to poof or something

3167
02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:55.185
I can't remember what I told him to make him blink.

3168
02:36:55.185 --> 02:36:59.150
Blink, maybe I said.
SAM: There's a magic word.

3169
02:36:59.150 --> 02:36:59.983
MATT: "I'll see what I can do."

3170
02:36:59.983 --> 02:37:02.549
LAURA: Try stuff that sounds like blinking,

3171
02:37:02.549 --> 02:37:05.174
and he'll figure it out.

3172
02:37:05.174 --> 02:37:08.632
MATT: "Okay, I've never had a pet before."

3173
02:37:08.632 --> 02:37:11.967
LAURA: I'll have to look into my journal and I don't--

3174
02:37:11.967 --> 02:37:13.700
I'll send you a message if I remember, okay?

3175
02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:16.449
MATT: "Yeah no, that's great."
LAURA: Okay.

3176
02:37:16.449 --> 02:37:18.640
MARISHA: Taliesin's losing it.

3177
02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:21.381
TALIESIN: I'm not okay over here.

3178
02:37:21.381 --> 02:37:25.070
SAM: Here, take this dagger and I have a second dagger,

3179
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:28.198
put that under your pillow, just in case.

3180
02:37:28.198 --> 02:37:33.198
Yes, don't leave this room; I'll have food sent up here.

3181
02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:35.473
MATT: "Okay."

3182
02:37:38.268 --> 02:37:43.268
SAM: Before we go. Can you please call Old Lady Edith

3183
02:37:43.470 --> 02:37:46.080
and just make sure our son is okay?

3184
02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:46.913
LAURA: Of course.

3185
02:37:46.913 --> 02:37:48.679
I wish you would have had me do it last night, but cool.

3186
02:37:48.679 --> 02:37:52.254
SAM: Sorry, I don't know magic works.

3187
02:37:52.254 --> 02:37:53.454
LAURA: Yes, you do!

3188
02:37:53.454 --> 02:37:54.370
SAM: I do.

3189
02:37:54.370 --> 02:37:56.850
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send old lady--

3190
02:37:56.850 --> 02:37:59.930
why can't I just send it to Luc?

3191
02:37:59.930 --> 02:38:02.532
SAM: I don't want to him to be scared.

3192
02:38:02.532 --> 02:38:04.040
LAURA: I can send something really nice.

3193
02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:07.470
SAM: You'll say something like, "Me and your mom

3194
02:38:07.470 --> 02:38:10.185
are going to go fight a giant."

3195
02:38:10.185 --> 02:38:12.270
LAURA: I won't say that.
SAM: All right, go

3196
02:38:12.270 --> 02:38:14.200
straight to Luc then.
LAURA: Really?

3197
02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:15.420
SAM: Sure.

3198
02:38:15.420 --> 02:38:16.850
Be nice.

3199
02:38:16.850 --> 02:38:18.760
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Don't say holla.

3200
02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:21.901
TALIESIN: You me on this?
TRAVIS: Yep.

3201
02:38:21.901 --> 02:38:22.734
TALIESIN: Okay.

3202
02:38:24.192 --> 02:38:25.275
LAURA: Hey, Luc!

3203
02:38:26.290 --> 02:38:29.090
It's the blue lady you met that one time.

3204
02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:30.640
I'm with your mom and your dad.

3205
02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:35.670
They love you. They're cool and okay.

3206
02:38:36.890 --> 02:38:39.581
SAM: Are you okay?
LAURA: Are <i>you</i> okay?

3207
02:38:39.581 --> 02:38:42.707
(laughter)

3208
02:38:42.707 --> 02:38:43.624
Too, though?

3209
02:38:46.078 --> 02:38:47.466
Yeah, I think that was a good amount, yes?

3210
02:38:47.466 --> 02:38:49.981
TRAVIS: Are you okay, too?
TALIESIN: I forgot.

3211
02:38:49.981 --> 02:38:53.480
MATT: "I don't know where this is coming from, but hi.

3212
02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:56.293
"Wow.

3213
02:38:58.360 --> 02:38:59.193
"Hello?

3214
02:39:02.170 --> 02:39:04.120
"I don't hear you anymore."

3215
02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:07.320
LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: "Are you there?"

3216
02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:08.580
SAM: Oh god.

3217
02:39:09.790 --> 02:39:11.573
MATT: "Hello?"

3218
02:39:11.573 --> 02:39:13.256
TALIESIN: What is happening tonight?

3219
02:39:13.256 --> 02:39:14.360
MATT: "Blue lady?

3220
02:39:17.290 --> 02:39:20.420
"Blue lady, I can't hear you--" It just cuts off.

3221
02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:23.159
(laughter)

3222
02:39:23.159 --> 02:39:24.800
LAURA: He sounds like he's pretty good.

3223
02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:26.450
TALIESIN: Sounds like the kid who opened his closet

3224
02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:28.830
that one time and there was a fucking troll in there

3225
02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:32.680
and the rest of his life he knows something happened

3226
02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:35.950
even though it was gone when he went to check again.

3227
02:39:35.950 --> 02:39:38.736
Never okay again. I'm not saying that happened to me.

3228
02:39:38.736 --> 02:39:42.040
LAURA: He's alive and he sounded really healthy and stuff.

3229
02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:44.470
SAM: Okay, good.
TALIESIN: Just scarred for life now.

3230
02:39:44.470 --> 02:39:47.990
SAM: All right. Don't die. Stay here, stay safe.

3231
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:50.490
We'll be back in three days.

3232
02:39:50.490 --> 02:39:53.620
LAURA: Maybe four.
SAM: Three! One to travel,

3233
02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:56.330
one to <i>kill</i>, and one to come home.

3234
02:39:56.330 --> 02:39:58.671
TALIESIN: Two to travel, two to kill, two to get home.

3235
02:39:58.671 --> 02:40:02.262
SAM: And then when we get home (clinking).

3236
02:40:03.147 --> 02:40:04.085
ASHLEY: Oh.

3237
02:40:06.211 --> 02:40:07.044
MATT: "Oh.

3238
02:40:09.453 --> 02:40:13.194
"It's just powdered water."
SAM: I know.

3239
02:40:13.194 --> 02:40:14.952
(laughter)

3240
02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:18.960
MATT: "Well, good luck, guys. Be careful.

3241
02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:22.040
"I'll take care of--ah, it's tickling.

3242
02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:24.865
"I'll take care of your pets, Ms. Jester."

3243
02:40:24.865 --> 02:40:25.698
LAURA: Oh!

3244
02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:31.550
MATT: "And I ask you guys take care of yourselves--oh boy."

3245
02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:33.507
ASHLEY: We'll take care of Veth.

3246
02:40:33.507 --> 02:40:35.482
We'll make sure nothing happens to her.

3247
02:40:35.482 --> 02:40:37.315
MATT: "Thank you.

3248
02:40:39.683 --> 02:40:41.193
"These knives are pretty cool."

3249
02:40:42.591 --> 02:40:43.910
TALIESIN: You leave him with a bit of money, too, I assume?

3250
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:46.103
SAM: Sure sure sure, here take 20 platinum.

3251
02:40:46.103 --> 02:40:50.400
MATT: "Ah! What have you--?"

3252
02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:51.885
SAM: Sorry. 10 platinum.

3253
02:40:54.868 --> 02:40:57.230
MATT: "I'm in the wrong line of work.

3254
02:40:58.790 --> 02:41:01.900
"Okay, well, bye."

3255
02:41:03.650 --> 02:41:05.636
SAM: Let's go.

3256
02:41:05.636 --> 02:41:06.828
LAURA: Okay.

3257
02:41:06.828 --> 02:41:07.674
MATT: "Veth?"

3258
02:41:07.674 --> 02:41:08.957
SAM: Huh?

3259
02:41:08.957 --> 02:41:10.457
MATT: "Be careful, okay?"

3260
02:41:11.380 --> 02:41:14.097
SAM: I'll take care of them.

3261
02:41:14.097 --> 02:41:16.050
MATT: (quietly) "Love you."

3262
02:41:16.050 --> 02:41:17.375
SAM: (muffled through cough) Love you, too.

3263
02:41:18.870 --> 02:41:20.560
MATT: He closes the door. (creak)

3264
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:24.353
LAURA: Did you always not say I love you very loudly?

3265
02:41:24.353 --> 02:41:25.960
SAM: I just don't want to say it in front of you guys

3266
02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:26.843
because you'll make fun of me.

3267
02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:28.284
LAURA: What if we die when we're out--

3268
02:41:28.284 --> 02:41:29.117
SAM: I said it--

3269
02:41:29.117 --> 02:41:30.084
LAURA: --and you never said it again.

3270
02:41:30.084 --> 02:41:30.917
You should go back in there

3271
02:41:30.917 --> 02:41:32.866
and tell him how much you love him.

3272
02:41:32.866 --> 02:41:33.840
Go on in there

3273
02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:36.158
right now!
SAM: (yelling) I love you!

3274
02:41:36.158 --> 02:41:39.095
MATT: "Ah!" You hear the daggers (metal clanging)

3275
02:41:39.095 --> 02:41:41.054
hitting the ground. (barks)

3276
02:41:41.054 --> 02:41:45.211
(laughter)

3277
02:41:45.211 --> 02:41:46.761
SAM: I feel better.

3278
02:41:47.694 --> 02:41:49.740
MARISHA: Look at you, you sensitive lot.

3279
02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:52.290
TALIESIN: That was beautiful.
MARISHA: That was good.

3280
02:41:52.290 --> 02:41:54.406
SAM: Let's go kill something.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3281
02:41:54.406 --> 02:41:55.248
LAURA: Yeah.

3282
02:41:55.248 --> 02:41:56.200
MATT: All right, you gather up

3283
02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:00.120
your moorbounders, calm them down, kick the chains off.

3284
02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:01.820
They are still prepped for riding.

3285
02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:05.440
What's the riding arrangement here?

3286
02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:07.210
TALIESIN: We've got Clarabelle. Anybody

3287
02:42:07.210 --> 02:42:09.020
who's feeling pretty confident.

3288
02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:13.270
She's a little all over the place but all right.

3289
02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:15.700
ASHLEY: I'll give it a try.
TALIESIN: All right.

3290
02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:16.533
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3291
02:42:17.534 --> 02:42:19.318
You're with me.
ASHLEY: Okay.

3292
02:42:19.318 --> 02:42:21.150
LIAM: Jannik is angry and likes to kill.

3293
02:42:21.150 --> 02:42:22.200
MARISHA: I'll be on Jannik.

3294
02:42:23.050 --> 02:42:24.880
TRAVIS: I'll go with Yarnball.

3295
02:42:27.690 --> 02:42:30.440
SAM: Yeah, I'll stick with Yarnball too. That sounds fun.

3296
02:42:32.395 --> 02:42:33.228
TALIESIN: Okay.

3297
02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:38.170
MATT: All righty. So as you all mount up,

3298
02:42:40.590 --> 02:42:42.580
where are you going?

3299
02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:43.413
SAM: Did she tell us where to go?

3300
02:42:44.396 --> 02:42:45.229
MATT: She didn't.

3301
02:42:45.229 --> 02:42:46.850
SAM: Fuck.

3302
02:42:46.850 --> 02:42:49.575
MATT: She said northwest towards where the

3303
02:42:49.575 --> 02:42:52.783
Penumbra Wildlands hits the...

3304
02:42:54.092 --> 02:42:55.980
...where the Penumbra Range hits the Vermaloc.

3305
02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:57.641
SAM: We're going to ask for directions on the way.

3306
02:42:57.641 --> 02:42:58.732
LAURA: Oh no, do you have to go

3307
02:42:58.732 --> 02:43:00.640
through the Ghostlands?

3308
02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:02.456
MATT: You ask around and you do.

3309
02:43:02.456 --> 02:43:06.343
There are two roads that are well guarded:

3310
02:43:06.343 --> 02:43:09.940
one that heads northwest and one that heads northeast.

3311
02:43:12.730 --> 02:43:14.680
You want to take the one that goes to the northwest.

3312
02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:16.612
TALIESIN: We'll take the one least traveled.

3313
02:43:17.637 --> 02:43:19.910
LIAM: Are we turning past--clothes was bought already?

3314
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:21.480
Like we're saying that already happened?

3315
02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:24.450
SAM: Do you have some specific clothes?

3316
02:43:24.450 --> 02:43:25.283
LIAM: No, but--

3317
02:43:25.283 --> 02:43:27.119
TALIESIN: We'll figure that out later.

3318
02:43:27.119 --> 02:43:28.090
LAURA: What? You don't want to

3319
02:43:28.090 --> 02:43:30.460
describe your clothes?
LIAM: I just bought a cloak.

3320
02:43:30.460 --> 02:43:32.540
A cloak to cover

3321
02:43:32.540 --> 02:43:33.373
the clothes I already have.

3322
02:43:33.373 --> 02:43:34.806
LAURA: I bought a fucking dress.

3323
02:43:34.806 --> 02:43:35.738
SAM: As did I.

3324
02:43:36.587 --> 02:43:39.353
LAURA: (gasps) Nott's wearing a dress?!

3325
02:43:39.353 --> 02:43:41.323
SAM: Took off all that shit. I don't need

3326
02:43:41.323 --> 02:43:43.971
that shit around here.

3327
02:43:43.971 --> 02:43:44.996
LAURA: What about your mask?

3328
02:43:44.996 --> 02:43:46.562
SAM: No, I don't need that here.

3329
02:43:47.411 --> 02:43:48.710
LAURA: Oh my god.
SAM: Around these parts,

3330
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:50.390
I'm fucking beautiful.

3331
02:43:51.750 --> 02:43:53.590
LIAM: We've got to do this, then.

3332
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:56.823
That trick you used make windows open and close,

3333
02:43:56.823 --> 02:43:58.370
you do all kinds of things with it.

3334
02:43:58.370 --> 02:44:01.580
Can you make this lather? Can you lather this?

3335
02:44:01.580 --> 02:44:04.760
LAURA: It's not like that sort of thing.

3336
02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:08.351
I can make it sound like you've got bugs in your ear.

3337
02:44:09.918 --> 02:44:11.475
LIAM: (sighs) Uh.

3338
02:44:11.475 --> 02:44:13.500
MATT: (laughs)

3339
02:44:14.433 --> 02:44:17.188
LIAM: Does anyone--Caduceus, do you have any soap?

3340
02:44:17.188 --> 02:44:19.430
TALIESIN: I do not have any soap. Well, actually, hold on.

3341
02:44:19.430 --> 02:44:22.013
Let me--I haven't looked in my bag in a while.

3342
02:44:26.385 --> 02:44:28.644
I mean technically... hmm.

3343
02:44:28.644 --> 02:44:30.114
LIAM: I tell you what I'm going to do.

3344
02:44:30.114 --> 02:44:31.560
I take one of the bobas out of that jar

3345
02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:34.720
and I mash it up and I just--

3346
02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:36.080
TALIESIN: Actually, I have enough of a tea set

3347
02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:38.160
that I can probably turn that into a lather with--

3348
02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:39.580
LIAM: My beard's already full of boba.

3349
02:44:39.580 --> 02:44:41.090
TALIESIN: Never mind. That's beautiful.

3350
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:44.380
LIAM: Yasha--
LAURA: That's so nourishing.

3351
02:44:44.380 --> 02:44:46.146
LIAM: If you would, please.

3352
02:44:46.146 --> 02:44:47.879
ASHLEY: Yes. Would you like me to use--?

3353
02:44:47.879 --> 02:44:49.140
LIAM: Would you shave me, please?

3354
02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:49.982
ASHLEY: Yes.

3355
02:44:50.878 --> 02:44:52.564
With the sword or do you want me to try with the--?

3356
02:44:52.564 --> 02:44:53.659
SAM: No, do the sword.
LIAM: Oh, you want to do

3357
02:44:53.659 --> 02:44:55.790
a little razor?
ASHLEY: I've never done it.

3358
02:44:57.240 --> 02:44:59.243
I feel more comfortable with the sword.

3359
02:44:59.243 --> 02:45:00.420
LIAM: I know. I think we should

3360
02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:01.540
do it with the sword, just--
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

3361
02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:03.893
LIAM: Just one last time.
ASHLEY: One last time.

3362
02:45:03.893 --> 02:45:05.718
TALIESIN: And Cure Wounds on the ready.

3363
02:45:06.717 --> 02:45:07.550
MATT: Okay.

3364
02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:09.571
ASHLEY: Ready?
LIAM: Oh yes.

3365
02:45:09.571 --> 02:45:13.845
ASHLEY: Lay down. I go to town.

3366
02:45:13.845 --> 02:45:15.891
MATT: Okay.

3367
02:45:15.891 --> 02:45:20.260
Once again, I'll remind you: it's a greatsword. It is heavy.

3368
02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:23.501
LIAM: Just go slow.

3369
02:45:23.501 --> 02:45:26.692
MATT: It lacks the--you can get towards the tip,

3370
02:45:26.692 --> 02:45:30.401
and by holding it, jam it into the nooks and crannies.

3371
02:45:30.401 --> 02:45:33.150
I will ask you to roll

3372
02:45:33.150 --> 02:45:35.968
a dexterity check for me.

3373
02:45:35.968 --> 02:45:38.368
ASHLEY: Okay.

3374
02:45:41.544 --> 02:45:43.911
Okay.

3375
02:45:45.586 --> 02:45:46.844
Uh-oh.

3376
02:45:46.844 --> 02:45:49.344
(laughter)

3377
02:45:49.344 --> 02:45:50.560
Wait, hold on, I feel like I have

3378
02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:52.350
advantage on dex for something.

3379
02:45:52.350 --> 02:45:54.250
MATT: Your dex saving throw is, but not dex check.

3380
02:45:54.250 --> 02:45:56.740
ASHLEY: This is not a saving throw. Eight.

3381
02:45:56.740 --> 02:45:58.598
MATT: Okay.

3382
02:45:59.442 --> 02:46:01.669
TRAVIS: Get a tusk hole.

3383
02:46:01.669 --> 02:46:05.260
SAM: Remember Van Gogh?
(Matt laughs)

3384
02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:07.360
MATT: There is a--

3385
02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:12.430
at first, it's a little scary,

3386
02:46:12.430 --> 02:46:15.240
but you've been here before and it's comfortable.

3387
02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:17.583
Then there's the first (slicing).

3388
02:46:17.583 --> 02:46:21.515
Oh that kind of hurt, but it's going to happen.

3389
02:46:21.515 --> 02:46:26.365
(pained noises)

3390
02:46:26.365 --> 02:46:29.095
Oh, that's warm.

3391
02:46:29.095 --> 02:46:30.840
LIAM: Oh god.

3392
02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:35.170
MATT: There's bleeding. You nicked him right in the ear

3393
02:46:35.170 --> 02:46:37.770
and there's about an inch long gash that's bleeding.

3394
02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:43.475
LIAM: Yeah, maybe the straight razor's the way to go.

3395
02:46:43.475 --> 02:46:44.908
MATT: You take a point of damage.

3396
02:46:44.908 --> 02:46:47.354
LIAM: Okay. I'm feeling a little faint, I'll be right back.

3397
02:46:47.354 --> 02:46:51.510
And I stumble off towards the water closet

3398
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:55.820
and I do my best to stop the bleeding.

3399
02:46:55.820 --> 02:46:57.460
Ten minutes goes by before you see me again,

3400
02:46:57.460 --> 02:47:00.170
but before I come back, I take out the straight razor

3401
02:47:00.170 --> 02:47:05.170
and it hurts, but slowly shave away the entire beard clean.

3402
02:47:06.290 --> 02:47:11.207
MATT: Okay yeah, you take the time for it, manage to do so.

3403
02:47:13.210 --> 02:47:15.237
But you got half of it. I mean, that's good.

3404
02:47:15.237 --> 02:47:16.479
ASHLEY: Yeah, I got a good amount.

3405
02:47:16.479 --> 02:47:21.475
LIAM: I also unwrap my arms and take those and throw them

3406
02:47:21.475 --> 02:47:24.001
on the ground and rejoin the group.

3407
02:47:24.001 --> 02:47:26.370
MATT: Okay.

3408
02:47:26.370 --> 02:47:31.095
LAURA: I remember and I rush into the room with Yeza.

3409
02:47:31.095 --> 02:47:32.760
Home!

3410
02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:34.451
MATT: "What?"

3411
02:47:34.451 --> 02:47:36.840
LAURA: That's what you tell Nugget.

3412
02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:37.940
MATT: "Okay."
LAURA: Thank you.

3413
02:47:37.940 --> 02:47:41.064
MATT: "Home?"
LAURA: Home.

3414
02:47:41.064 --> 02:47:44.545
LAURA: Nugget, he's home.

3415
02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:48.390
Just for now.

3416
02:47:48.390 --> 02:47:50.745
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

3417
02:47:54.463 --> 02:47:56.380
LAURA: (hums)

3418
02:47:57.994 --> 02:48:01.051
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
SAM: Yeah sure, that's fine.

3419
02:48:01.051 --> 02:48:03.700
LAURA: About as good--11.

3420
02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:08.579
MATT: 11, okay (pants).

3421
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:13.189
LAURA: Oh, you're so cute! I love you.

3422
02:48:13.189 --> 02:48:14.250
MATT: (pants)

3423
02:48:14.250 --> 02:48:16.450
LAURA: Yeza, really, try to do something with this dog.

3424
02:48:16.450 --> 02:48:19.090
Like, why haven't you trained him better already?

3425
02:48:19.090 --> 02:48:22.860
MATT: "I literally just got the weasel from biting my ear."

3426
02:48:22.860 --> 02:48:26.900
The door closes as you leave.

3427
02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:31.730
All right, freshly shaven, freshly perturbed Yeza.

3428
02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:36.492
You guys got freshly hit volume.

3429
02:48:38.297 --> 02:48:42.980
You gather your pack of moorbounders (galloping).

3430
02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:45.150
You're used to horseback, where it's a steady thing.

3431
02:48:45.150 --> 02:48:48.883
This is (bounding) It takes you--

3432
02:48:48.883 --> 02:48:51.008
It's a very unique process

3433
02:48:51.008 --> 02:48:55.970
of heavy bobs and impacts. It leaps and runs

3434
02:48:55.970 --> 02:48:59.323
like a panther from edge to edge. It's a lot of

3435
02:48:59.323 --> 02:49:01.840
springing and catching, springing and catching

3436
02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:05.300
with respect to the roads and streets.

3437
02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:07.450
It makes it way through the Gallimaufry.

3438
02:49:07.450 --> 02:49:10.010
You watch as buildings and lights, the green glows,

3439
02:49:10.010 --> 02:49:13.370
the red glows, everything just whooshing by.

3440
02:49:13.370 --> 02:49:16.410
These creatures are not common to this part of Xhorhas,

3441
02:49:16.410 --> 02:49:18.280
so people in the streets turn around and watch you

3442
02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:22.261
just whiz by. The Aurora Watch look out and go, "What?"

3443
02:49:22.261 --> 02:49:24.880
and you guys just cruise past.

3444
02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:26.880
Eventually, heading further north

3445
02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:28.840
you make your way out of the Gallimaufry into the Coronas.

3446
02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:33.840
The Coronas, you now see, are the poorer area of the city

3447
02:49:34.750 --> 02:49:37.450
and where a lot more of the non-drows seem to live

3448
02:49:37.450 --> 02:49:40.247
or at least are coming towards. You can see

3449
02:49:40.247 --> 02:49:42.820
large stacks upon stacks of goblin domiciles

3450
02:49:42.820 --> 02:49:44.830
that look rickety and ready to fall over any minute.

3451
02:49:44.830 --> 02:49:49.830
You can see heavy mud/clay homes that are built for ogres

3452
02:49:50.170 --> 02:49:52.740
and other such goblinoids that have found a place here.

3453
02:49:52.740 --> 02:49:55.930
You can see the exterior walls that mark the barrier

3454
02:49:55.930 --> 02:49:59.290
between the Coronas and the Ghostlands.

3455
02:49:59.290 --> 02:50:01.190
As you skirt around to the left to find

3456
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:03.200
the nearest pathway out, eventually you come across

3457
02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:06.710
the first main gate that exits, what you assume to be

3458
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:10.450
the road that exits to the direction you need to travel.

3459
02:50:10.450 --> 02:50:12.560
Heading out of the front gate, as you bound up

3460
02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:14.576
into the front area.

3461
02:50:14.576 --> 02:50:16.770
It looks to be then Aurora Watch are there

3462
02:50:16.770 --> 02:50:19.870
keeping the gate closed at the moment.

3463
02:50:19.870 --> 02:50:22.960
As you all begin to approach, some pull out weapons

3464
02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:25.120
like swords and have spears at the ready

3465
02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:26.780
and they raise a hand in the defensive position.

3466
02:50:26.780 --> 02:50:31.000
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" One of them looks out to all of you.

3467
02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.174
"What is your business?

3468
02:50:33.174 --> 02:50:35.390
"Where are you going?"

3469
02:50:35.390 --> 02:50:40.027
MARISHA: We're running an errand for Professor Waccoh.

3470
02:50:42.820 --> 02:50:44.830
MATT: "You're heading out this way?"

3471
02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:47.180
SAM: We're going to--where are we going to?

3472
02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:48.910
MARISHA: The Deepriver Mining Camp.

3473
02:50:48.910 --> 02:50:51.740
SAM: Is that this way?

3474
02:50:51.740 --> 02:50:53.650
MATT: "Aye."

3475
02:50:53.650 --> 02:50:55.890
What you didn't see

3476
02:50:55.890 --> 02:50:58.350
at the top of the wall are two folks in each side

3477
02:50:58.350 --> 02:51:00.961
that have these large heavy wenches and they begin to

3478
02:51:00.961 --> 02:51:02.452
(wheels turning)

3479
02:51:02.452 --> 02:51:04.413
and you hear the chains grow taut

3480
02:51:04.413 --> 02:51:07.268
and begin to grind upward towards

3481
02:51:07.268 --> 02:51:11.050
unseen gears and the doors begin to open outward.

3482
02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:16.580
The first thing you see before you

3483
02:51:16.580 --> 02:51:20.960
is this nice, solid, hard-packed earth road,

3484
02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:24.033
maybe 20 feet across side to side.

3485
02:51:24.033 --> 02:51:28.330
It just continues forward. Beyond that, you can see

3486
02:51:28.330 --> 02:51:33.291
an endless horizon of broken ruins:

3487
02:51:33.291 --> 02:51:37.700
structures, buildings, towers, other walls,

3488
02:51:37.700 --> 02:51:42.695
and hooked spires all crumbled, broken,

3489
02:51:43.890 --> 02:51:46.511
burned, and charred. Everything seems to have a layer of

3490
02:51:46.511 --> 02:51:50.690
black carbon dust across it.

3491
02:51:50.690 --> 02:51:53.600
You can see twisted bits of metal that are mostly

3492
02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:57.760
covered by ash and soot that's still and just rest amongst.

3493
02:51:57.760 --> 02:52:02.510
This is an ancient war ground that has long since

3494
02:52:02.510 --> 02:52:07.300
been slowly overtaken by the falling of rain,

3495
02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:10.990
mud, and other weather that has come through and

3496
02:52:10.990 --> 02:52:15.130
rusted or eroded what remains.

3497
02:52:15.130 --> 02:52:18.881
You can see along the way, pairs of Aurora Watch

3498
02:52:18.881 --> 02:52:22.490
just patrolling the edges of the road.

3499
02:52:22.490 --> 02:52:25.940
Right beyond the wall as you step out

3500
02:52:25.940 --> 02:52:28.060
on the outskirts, pressed up against the wall

3501
02:52:28.060 --> 02:52:32.980
you can see collections of tents and stick huts

3502
02:52:32.980 --> 02:52:35.110
and folks that either

3503
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:38.160
haven't made their way into the Coronas or are trying

3504
02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:43.160
to find a way outward to build a homestead on the outskirts.

3505
02:52:43.605 --> 02:52:47.772
As the gates open, you can see about a half dozen or so

3506
02:52:47.772 --> 02:52:52.380
goblin children rush out to see and they watch quietly

3507
02:52:52.380 --> 02:52:54.120
as you all make your way out

3508
02:52:54.120 --> 02:52:58.270
before the gates close behind you.

3509
02:52:59.340 --> 02:53:03.199
Cold wind picks up, pushing your hair back a bit.

3510
02:53:03.199 --> 02:53:05.660
Chills running down your spine; you can feel

3511
02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:08.870
the goosebumps across your skin.

3512
02:53:08.870 --> 02:53:13.710
Looking out, what would be mid-afternoon

3513
02:53:13.710 --> 02:53:16.800
looks like it's the pitchest dark midnight.

3514
02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:20.830
The faint hue of white moonlight is gently

3515
02:53:20.830 --> 02:53:24.350
causing the outlined rim of these structures

3516
02:53:24.350 --> 02:53:27.530
to be visible from your standpoint. The road

3517
02:53:27.530 --> 02:53:31.871
just continues onto an endless pass into the horizon.

3518
02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:38.700
Your moorbounders take off, picking up speed.

3519
02:53:39.663 --> 02:53:43.520
You can hear the heavy (pants) with each leap

3520
02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:46.990
and foot fall, the dust and dirt collecting by it.

3521
02:53:46.990 --> 02:53:50.830
Probably Clarabelle would be in the back.

3522
02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:53.823
Occasionally the clouds of dust and ash get kicked up

3523
02:53:53.823 --> 02:53:56.260
brush past you and you guard yourself.

3524
02:53:56.260 --> 02:53:57.630
It gets in your eyes a bit

3525
02:53:57.630 --> 02:53:59.740
and you have to wince a bit and clear it out.

3526
02:53:59.740 --> 02:54:02.844
LIAM: Jannik, <i>schnell</i>.

3527
02:54:05.390 --> 02:54:09.060
MATT: You guys continue moving forward,

3528
02:54:09.060 --> 02:54:13.480
eventually coming to an even ground of you traveling

3529
02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:16.720
alongside each other at the same pace.

3530
02:54:16.720 --> 02:54:19.690
You catch off in the distance--

3531
02:54:19.690 --> 02:54:22.430
you swear a couple times, you glance over towards the ruins

3532
02:54:22.430 --> 02:54:26.080
and you faint lights spark.

3533
02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:28.540
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave.

3534
02:54:28.540 --> 02:54:29.870
MATT: What's the range on that one?

3535
02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:31.330
TALIESIN: 60 feet.
MATT: 60 feet.

3536
02:54:31.330 --> 02:54:34.100
Too far away, unfortunately, initially. You see

3537
02:54:34.100 --> 02:54:36.933
just a light and it's gone, and you're like,

3538
02:54:36.933 --> 02:54:38.662
"Oh, that's strange,"

3539
02:54:38.662 --> 02:54:41.328
and you look off this way and you see another.

3540
02:54:41.328 --> 02:54:45.378
TALIESIN: There's a lot around us.

3541
02:54:45.378 --> 02:54:47.128
MATT: You continue on.

3542
02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:49.890
TALIESIN: Hmm.

3543
02:54:49.890 --> 02:54:52.350
MATT: Keeping your eyes peeled, you focus forward

3544
02:54:52.350 --> 02:54:55.100
but are attending all of your brain power

3545
02:54:55.100 --> 02:54:58.890
towards your peripheral, looking for any other sign

3546
02:54:58.890 --> 02:55:03.890
of shifting or movement. You do see some creatures

3547
02:55:03.900 --> 02:55:05.340
over to the right of you. You look at them.

3548
02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:08.810
You can see a group of about a dozen or so,

3549
02:55:08.810 --> 02:55:12.930
a mix of mostly bugbears and a handful of goblins.

3550
02:55:12.930 --> 02:55:15.840
You see them rummaging through some leftover ruins.

3551
02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:18.107
They have a little cart and they're throwing things

3552
02:55:18.107 --> 02:55:20.210
onto it. It looks like they're scavenging

3553
02:55:20.210 --> 02:55:23.540
essentially what they can find in the vicinity.

3554
02:55:23.540 --> 02:55:25.385
Moving on, and just a moment later, you see

3555
02:55:25.385 --> 02:55:29.160
emerging out of some of the ruin here,

3556
02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:32.614
a pale blue glow and

3557
02:55:32.614 --> 02:55:37.481
a female figure that drifts out of the ground.

3558
02:55:39.747 --> 02:55:41.000
LAURA: Hey Fjord?
TRAVIS: Hmm.

3559
02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:44.378
LAURA: There's a ghost.
TRAVIS: Where?

3560
02:55:44.378 --> 02:55:45.660
LAURA: Over there.

3561
02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:48.335
MATT: You glance over and you straight-up see

3562
02:55:48.335 --> 02:55:52.740
a spectral female that is drifting through a stone wall.

3563
02:55:52.740 --> 02:55:57.740
TRAVIS: Nope, no, that is a humanoid jellyfish.

3564
02:55:58.104 --> 02:56:00.345
LAURA: It was really pretty.

3565
02:56:00.345 --> 02:56:02.800
Keeps your eyes forward.

3566
02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:05.150
TALIESIN: That's so sad.

3567
02:56:05.150 --> 02:56:07.910
MARISHA: Why?

3568
02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:11.930
TALIESIN: It's just here and unconnected.

3569
02:56:11.930 --> 02:56:14.685
It's sad to be unconnected.

3570
02:56:16.060 --> 02:56:18.757
I wish I could do something.

3571
02:56:18.757 --> 02:56:20.260
MATT: A little ways ahead, about a quarter mile or so,

3572
02:56:20.260 --> 02:56:23.059
you can see another faint glow and some of the guards,

3573
02:56:23.059 --> 02:56:24.910
some of the patrols are rushing

3574
02:56:24.910 --> 02:56:27.200
towards it. As you get closer,

3575
02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:29.210
you catch up with it quickly. It looks like one of

3576
02:56:29.210 --> 02:56:31.510
these entities has wandered into the road

3577
02:56:31.510 --> 02:56:34.320
and the guards have rode forward with

3578
02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:36.960
silvered spears or some sort of weapon designed

3579
02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:38.670
specifically for the protection of this trek.

3580
02:56:38.670 --> 02:56:41.810
They manage to pierce its ethereal shell

3581
02:56:41.810 --> 02:56:45.567
and it dissipates.

3582
02:56:45.567 --> 02:56:46.926
LIAM: Is that one of the floating lights or

3583
02:56:46.926 --> 02:56:48.670
like a humanoid form?

3584
02:56:48.670 --> 02:56:50.570
MATT: This one, it looks to be a more humanoid form

3585
02:56:50.570 --> 02:56:53.280
before it dissipates.
TALIESIN: Does it dissipate,

3586
02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:55.450
would I know if they're banishing it,

3587
02:56:55.450 --> 02:56:59.520
or is it gone forever, is it just--?

3588
02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:03.403
MATT: Roll a religion check.
TALIESIN: That I can do.

3589
02:57:04.580 --> 02:57:05.600
15.

3590
02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:08.160
MATT: 15, you're not sure of the nature.

3591
02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:10.235
Some undead, it's temporary.

3592
02:57:10.235 --> 02:57:12.687
Some it is a permanent dissipation.

3593
02:57:12.687 --> 02:57:14.472
TALIESIN: I couldn't quite tell.

3594
02:57:14.472 --> 02:57:15.513
MATT: You were unable to tell for this one,

3595
02:57:15.513 --> 02:57:16.446
it could be either.

3596
02:57:16.446 --> 02:57:18.217
You do know that it is possible that some--

3597
02:57:18.217 --> 02:57:19.644
TALIESIN: There is weird stuff going on around here.

3598
02:57:19.644 --> 02:57:23.590
LAURA: Can we slow down enough to ask the guards:

3599
02:57:23.590 --> 02:57:28.590
What kind of spears do you use for the ghosts?

3600
02:57:29.060 --> 02:57:32.760
MATT: "These are anointed."

3601
02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:34.450
LAURA: Oh.

3602
02:57:34.450 --> 02:57:37.680
MATT: "Keeps them at bay, off of the path."

3603
02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:38.513
TALIESIN: We're travelers,

3604
02:57:38.513 --> 02:57:41.040
and I hope you don't mind the question:

3605
02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:44.845
What happened here?

3606
02:57:44.845 --> 02:57:47.450
MATT: "Do you not know the history of this land?"

3607
02:57:47.450 --> 02:57:50.060
TALIESIN: Not this part of the history, no.

3608
02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:51.810
MATT: "This is one of the final battlegrounds

3609
02:57:51.810 --> 02:57:54.360
"when the gods still walked the Earth.

3610
02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:56.310
"This is one of the places the Betrayers

3611
02:57:56.310 --> 02:57:59.470
"were brought to their knees and banished."

3612
02:57:59.470 --> 02:58:02.060
TALIESIN: And these spirits?
MATT: "These were the many,

3613
02:58:02.060 --> 02:58:07.060
many thousands, ten thousands, millions, I don't know,

3614
02:58:07.190 --> 02:58:11.390
"that were destroyed

3615
02:58:11.390 --> 02:58:14.031
"in the culmination of that battle."

3616
02:58:14.031 --> 02:58:16.240
ASHLEY: What are you doing to them?

3617
02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:19.210
MATT: "Keeping them from harrying you as you travel,

3618
02:58:19.210 --> 02:58:22.940
"wandering too close to the city."

3619
02:58:22.940 --> 02:58:24.048
TALIESIN: I'm surprised the city

3620
02:58:24.048 --> 02:58:25.873
hasn't expanded this far out yet

3621
02:58:25.873 --> 02:58:28.810
or tried to do something to retake this land.

3622
02:58:28.810 --> 02:58:31.210
MATT: "The city was once much smaller, but it's slowly

3623
02:58:31.210 --> 02:58:33.190
"building out, but it is a process."

3624
02:58:33.190 --> 02:58:35.241
TALIESIN: Are they still building out or?

3625
02:58:35.241 --> 02:58:37.380
MATT: "As they go, yes."

3626
02:58:37.380 --> 02:58:39.341
LAURA: They said it's been a while since they added

3627
02:58:39.341 --> 02:58:42.921
a new gate or a new wall or a new thing.

3628
02:58:42.921 --> 02:58:44.704
TALIESIN: Oh. Do you know how long it's been

3629
02:58:44.704 --> 02:58:47.930
since they've built a new wall?

3630
02:58:47.930 --> 02:58:49.850
MATT: "Not off the top of my head, no.

3631
02:58:49.850 --> 02:58:51.370
"I just run the street patrol."

3632
02:58:51.370 --> 02:58:54.750
TALIESIN: Well, thank you so much for keeping us safe.

3633
02:58:54.750 --> 02:58:57.000
MATT: "Good luck."

3634
02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:58.530
LIAM: We are traveling out to Deepriver,

3635
02:58:58.530 --> 02:59:00.620
it's a ways, can we expect guards like you

3636
02:59:00.620 --> 02:59:02.970
along the way the entire time?

3637
02:59:02.970 --> 02:59:06.000
MATT: "Only until you get out of the Ghostlands.

3638
02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.140
"Our patrol only goes to the perimeter and back."

3639
02:59:08.140 --> 02:59:10.200
LIAM: All right.

3640
02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:12.611
Thank you.

3641
02:59:12.611 --> 02:59:16.220
MATT: "Of course," and he turns around, a strange glance

3642
02:59:16.220 --> 02:59:19.540
towards the clean-shaven human,

3643
02:59:19.540 --> 02:59:22.810
not a common sight that passes them by

3644
02:59:22.810 --> 02:59:26.155
on these main roads this far east.

3645
02:59:27.420 --> 02:59:31.650
Continuing your journey, bounding further down the road,

3646
02:59:31.650 --> 02:59:36.160
still seeing the occasional (poofing). For an instant,

3647
02:59:36.160 --> 02:59:40.110
you think you see a large one loom up,

3648
02:59:40.110 --> 02:59:43.784
a figure that's fainter than others you've seen,

3649
02:59:43.784 --> 02:59:45.720
but the shape is larger. It seems to resemble

3650
02:59:45.720 --> 02:59:48.680
a slow-moving wave, like a hand or something

3651
02:59:48.680 --> 02:59:53.090
that curls over a ruin before it dissipates in the mist.

3652
02:59:53.090 --> 02:59:55.320
The mist is heavy the further out you go.

3653
02:59:55.320 --> 02:59:57.460
You can see the tops of the ruins, but a lot of the area

3654
02:59:57.460 --> 03:00:01.660
seems to be fully encompassed by this low-hanging fog

3655
03:00:01.660 --> 03:00:05.237
that obscures most of the floor.

3656
03:00:07.150 --> 03:00:11.675
About, let's say,

3657
03:00:11.675 --> 03:00:14.400
six or seven hours of travel,

3658
03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:17.970
the ruins give way and you find yourselves

3659
03:00:17.970 --> 03:00:20.190
in an open field now.

3660
03:00:20.190 --> 03:00:22.590
LAURA: It's still dark?
MATT: It's still dark, and

3661
03:00:22.590 --> 03:00:23.770
now it should be dark.

3662
03:00:23.770 --> 03:00:26.240
You have officially hit nighttime,

3663
03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:31.240
so no idea if the transition has occurred yet or if it will,

3664
03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:36.300
but you're now mid-evening,

3665
03:00:36.300 --> 03:00:41.300
pushing, I'd say, 10 o'clock-ish.

3666
03:00:41.866 --> 03:00:44.062
You're making your way further and further

3667
03:00:44.062 --> 03:00:47.212
down the road, heading in that direction.

3668
03:00:47.212 --> 03:00:48.970
You push until about midnight or so.

3669
03:00:48.970 --> 03:00:53.970
You've now been going for, I'd say, close to eight hours.

3670
03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:56.420
Your moorbounders are starting to slow a bit.

3671
03:00:56.420 --> 03:01:00.160
You can hear (wheezes) of fatigue.

3672
03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:04.320
LIAM: I round Jannik about and stop the group.

3673
03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:07.150
This is quite a ways, camp for the night?

3674
03:01:07.150 --> 03:01:09.380
LAURA: Are we out of the Ghostlands?

3675
03:01:09.380 --> 03:01:12.907
MATT: You seem to, from a visual standpoint,

3676
03:01:12.907 --> 03:01:15.450
to be most likely out of the Ghostlands.

3677
03:01:15.450 --> 03:01:16.560
LAURA: I just want to make sure that Yarnball

3678
03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:19.895
is safe when we're in our little tent thing.

3679
03:01:19.895 --> 03:01:23.023
SAM: I think Yarnball can take care of Yarnball.

3680
03:01:23.023 --> 03:01:25.497
LAURA: She's pretty sweet.

3681
03:01:25.497 --> 03:01:27.969
TALIESIN: I think they'll be all right.

3682
03:01:27.969 --> 03:01:30.010
I'll do a little check to make sure everything's okay.

3683
03:01:30.010 --> 03:01:34.470
LIAM: How long are the moorbounders from end to end?

3684
03:01:34.470 --> 03:01:38.650
MATT: End to end I'd say, head to tail,

3685
03:01:39.960 --> 03:01:44.960
they're about 16 feet, maybe.

3686
03:01:45.363 --> 03:01:48.140
Like 14 to 16 feet, yeah.

3687
03:01:48.140 --> 03:01:48.973
LAURA: Big boys.

3688
03:01:48.973 --> 03:01:49.970
LIAM: They're not coming in.

3689
03:01:49.970 --> 03:01:50.805
ASHLEY: That's a big boy.

3690
03:01:50.805 --> 03:01:51.638
TALIESIN: No.

3691
03:01:54.843 --> 03:01:56.418
MATT: Yeah, they're like riding bison,

3692
03:01:56.418 --> 03:01:59.930
like slick, lean bison.

3693
03:01:59.930 --> 03:02:02.750
SAM: Is there a place around here

3694
03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:06.620
with wreckage or rubble or something that we can camp

3695
03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:10.050
around, or is it just all open?

3696
03:02:10.050 --> 03:02:11.290
MATT: Currently, from where you are standing on the road,

3697
03:02:11.290 --> 03:02:16.080
it is open. It is just cracked, packed dirt and rock,

3698
03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:18.488
occasional bits of dried brush

3699
03:02:18.488 --> 03:02:22.521
and scrub bushes around.

3700
03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:28.980
While there is definitely the low fog--mist

3701
03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:31.617
seems to have permeated the vicinity

3702
03:02:31.617 --> 03:02:34.043
based on the temperature and time of night

3703
03:02:34.043 --> 03:02:35.940
and added element of moisture--the ground

3704
03:02:35.940 --> 03:02:40.887
does not appear to slick or muddy. It's pretty dry here.

3705
03:02:42.395 --> 03:02:43.995
LIAM: Well, why don't I set up the dome

3706
03:02:43.995 --> 03:02:46.095
a little bit off the road?

3707
03:02:46.095 --> 03:02:47.784
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3708
03:02:47.784 --> 03:02:49.290
LIAM: The moorbounders can sleep around it.

3709
03:02:49.290 --> 03:02:50.530
SAM and LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3710
03:02:50.530 --> 03:02:53.179
TALIESIN: That works.

3711
03:02:53.179 --> 03:02:54.690
I'm going to push another Eyes of the Grave

3712
03:02:54.690 --> 03:02:56.173
while we're walking around.

3713
03:02:56.173 --> 03:02:58.039
I'm going to see if anything pings.

3714
03:02:58.039 --> 03:02:59.520
MATT: Okay. You concentrate

3715
03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:02.180
and focus around you. Seems to be pretty safe.

3716
03:03:02.180 --> 03:03:04.700
TALIESIN: Okay.

3717
03:03:04.700 --> 03:03:06.390
MATT: You guys manage to set up camp that evening,

3718
03:03:06.390 --> 03:03:09.049
using your hut to keep the camp safe.

3719
03:03:09.049 --> 03:03:11.330
The moorbounders hold a perimeter

3720
03:03:11.330 --> 03:03:13.880
and you take a night's rest.

3721
03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:16.455
Uneventful, off the road.

3722
03:03:16.455 --> 03:03:19.629
When the morning comes, it is light.

3723
03:03:19.629 --> 03:03:22.277
SAM and TALIESIN: Hey!
MATT: Yes.

3724
03:03:22.277 --> 03:03:23.110
LAURA: Yay!

3725
03:03:23.110 --> 03:03:26.793
MATT: The sky is still clouded, there is no direct sunlight.

3726
03:03:27.775 --> 03:03:31.358
It is still a fairly gray sky,

3727
03:03:31.358 --> 03:03:33.983
but it is a lighter sky.

3728
03:03:33.983 --> 03:03:37.350
It is a day and it's been a little bit.

3729
03:03:37.350 --> 03:03:39.790
LIAM: The dome is somewhat filled with the sound

3730
03:03:39.790 --> 03:03:43.840
of Frumpkin purring heavily, making biscuits

3731
03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:48.840
in Jester's clothes in her sleeping form.

3732
03:03:49.433 --> 03:03:53.213
LAURA: (gasps) (laughs excitedly)

3733
03:03:53.213 --> 03:03:55.729
Hi! I scritch the ears.

3734
03:03:56.596 --> 03:03:58.071
MATT: (meows)

3735
03:03:58.071 --> 03:04:00.464
LAURA: Don't tell Caleb. And then I give

3736
03:04:00.464 --> 03:04:04.159
a little bit of pastry to Frumpkin.

3737
03:04:04.159 --> 03:04:05.941
MATT: (sniffs)

3738
03:04:05.941 --> 03:04:09.957
LAURA: Yeah.

3739
03:04:09.957 --> 03:04:12.460
Cool.

3740
03:04:12.460 --> 03:04:15.170
Caleb, can I keep Frumpkin forever?

3741
03:04:15.170 --> 03:04:19.330
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> what?
LAURA: Yes.

3742
03:04:19.330 --> 03:04:21.100
Good morning!
LIAM: Good morning.

3743
03:04:22.220 --> 03:04:25.130
LAURA: Good morning!
SAM: Morning!

3744
03:04:25.130 --> 03:04:26.930
LAURA: Good morning, everyone!

3745
03:04:26.930 --> 03:04:30.401
MARISHA: Morning.
ASHLEY: Eh.

3746
03:04:30.401 --> 03:04:31.234
TALIESIN: Good morning.

3747
03:04:31.234 --> 03:04:32.580
SAM: Was there any more specifics

3748
03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:36.104
about where this giant was?

3749
03:04:36.104 --> 03:04:38.460
MARISHA: In the mine.

3750
03:04:38.460 --> 03:04:39.874
TALIESIN: Talk to people in the mines, I'd imagine.

3751
03:04:39.874 --> 03:04:41.103
SAM: Are there people in the mines?

3752
03:04:41.103 --> 03:04:42.257
TALIESIN: There are people at the mines.

3753
03:04:42.257 --> 03:04:43.820
SAM: Oh, okay.

3754
03:04:43.820 --> 03:04:47.255
MATT: It's a chilly morning. Little bits of nearby

3755
03:04:47.255 --> 03:04:51.750
dried brush have a faint layer of frost across

3756
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:55.050
the top of them, giving them a slight grayish white hue.

3757
03:04:55.050 --> 03:04:57.950
LAURA: Ooh, I bring out the little rod of hand warming

3758
03:04:57.950 --> 03:05:00.930
that we got in the-- Is anybody cold?

3759
03:05:00.930 --> 03:05:02.309
Does anybody need a little hand warmer?

3760
03:05:02.309 --> 03:05:04.492
TALIESIN: I never say no to that. That's good.

3761
03:05:04.492 --> 03:05:06.127
Does it do feet too?

3762
03:05:06.127 --> 03:05:06.960
LAURA: Here you go.

3763
03:05:06.960 --> 03:05:08.800
You can hold onto it, it warms your hands up. It's nice.

3764
03:05:08.800 --> 03:05:11.000
MARISHA: Oh, it's good.
LAURA: Pass it around.

3765
03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:15.992
MARISHA: Mm, mm.

3766
03:05:16.962 --> 03:05:18.850
TRAVIS: I'm good, thank you.
MATT: The moorbounders are out

3767
03:05:18.850 --> 03:05:20.130
they're waiting. There appears

3768
03:05:20.130 --> 03:05:25.130
to be a mostly picked clean carcass of

3769
03:05:25.166 --> 03:05:29.099
a large wolf

3770
03:05:29.099 --> 03:05:32.580
that is mostly just blood-slick bones

3771
03:05:32.580 --> 03:05:36.140
and some torn fur. All the moorbounders,

3772
03:05:36.140 --> 03:05:39.515
the front of their mouths are caked with red.

3773
03:05:39.515 --> 03:05:41.215
They (teeth licking),

3774
03:05:41.215 --> 03:05:45.973
their eyes bugging out the side. (slurps)

3775
03:05:45.973 --> 03:05:48.433
LAURA: Nice, good job, buds.

3776
03:05:48.433 --> 03:05:51.610
ASHLEY: You got a snack?

3777
03:05:51.610 --> 03:05:53.480
LIAM: Who's a good apex predator?

3778
03:05:53.480 --> 03:05:55.647
MATT: (growling)

3779
03:05:56.617 --> 03:05:58.940
(laughter)

3780
03:05:58.940 --> 03:06:00.340
TALIESIN: Let me see if I can leave us a little patch

3781
03:06:00.340 --> 03:06:02.350
of something growing in whatever's left.

3782
03:06:02.350 --> 03:06:07.284
MATT: Easy enough to do. You use your cantrip to decompose.

3783
03:06:07.284 --> 03:06:11.374
The moisture from the morning especially makes it easy

3784
03:06:11.374 --> 03:06:13.790
to be conducive to this.

3785
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:17.700
A faint bit of a soft, reddish moss

3786
03:06:17.700 --> 03:06:21.360
begins to grow around the areas where the visible wounds

3787
03:06:21.360 --> 03:06:23.732
are across the flesh.

3788
03:06:23.732 --> 03:06:25.950
TALIESIN: We'll know when we come back.

3789
03:06:25.950 --> 03:06:28.277
LAURA: Oh, good call.

3790
03:06:28.277 --> 03:06:29.280
LIAM: All right, well, let's make hay

3791
03:06:29.280 --> 03:06:30.410
while the sun shines, shall we?

3792
03:06:30.410 --> 03:06:32.793
SAM: Woo hoo!

3793
03:06:32.793 --> 03:06:35.887
MATT: You continue on the path. (bounding)

3794
03:06:37.950 --> 03:06:39.993
No more guard.

3795
03:06:39.993 --> 03:06:40.990
The morning air is welcome.

3796
03:06:40.990 --> 03:06:43.440
As it rushes past, it is still cold, though.

3797
03:06:43.440 --> 03:06:46.265
At the pace you're going, you're having

3798
03:06:46.265 --> 03:06:48.050
to pull the hood up and trying to not immediately

3799
03:06:48.050 --> 03:06:50.570
frost the front of your face, but it does get warmer

3800
03:06:50.570 --> 03:06:54.610
as the morning progresses. Eventually you see

3801
03:06:54.610 --> 03:06:58.980
what you assume to be the Vermaloc, the edges of it,

3802
03:06:58.980 --> 03:07:03.350
as the Penumbra Range, which is a dark gray

3803
03:07:03.350 --> 03:07:07.540
black mountain range begins to--to the left of you--

3804
03:07:07.540 --> 03:07:12.232
give way to dense canopy

3805
03:07:12.232 --> 03:07:17.231
of deep reds, maroons, oranges.

3806
03:07:18.680 --> 03:07:23.680
It's a forest of perpetual fall.

3807
03:07:23.940 --> 03:07:28.940
The leaves vibrant, red, earth tones.

3808
03:07:29.335 --> 03:07:31.500
What bits you can see as you get closer

3809
03:07:31.500 --> 03:07:34.420
to it, the trees, the ones you can see in

3810
03:07:34.420 --> 03:07:39.420
the tree line, are about 12 feet up the canopy's beginning.

3811
03:07:39.480 --> 03:07:42.170
Even thin on the outside of the tree line,

3812
03:07:42.170 --> 03:07:47.113
the actual trees are smooth, purple bark.

3813
03:07:48.940 --> 03:07:52.060
MARISHA: These the trees you were talking about, Yasha?

3814
03:07:52.060 --> 03:07:54.015
ASHLEY: Yes.

3815
03:07:54.015 --> 03:07:54.848
TALIESIN: Beautiful.

3816
03:07:54.848 --> 03:07:56.710
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's beautiful.

3817
03:07:56.710 --> 03:08:00.540
LAURA: Have you seen these kind of trees before?

3818
03:08:00.540 --> 03:08:04.340
ASHLEY: Yes, I have,

3819
03:08:04.340 --> 03:08:09.293
but just the end of this forest.

3820
03:08:10.370 --> 03:08:12.440
I've never been up this high.

3821
03:08:12.440 --> 03:08:14.882
LAURA: But you lived kind of close?

3822
03:08:14.882 --> 03:08:18.600
ASHLEY: Uh, close enough.

3823
03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:22.260
SAM: Were you an arborist?

3824
03:08:23.630 --> 03:08:25.300
ASHLEY: I don't know if I know what that is.

3825
03:08:25.300 --> 03:08:26.460
TALIESIN: I know what that is.

3826
03:08:26.460 --> 03:08:29.088
SAM: A tree scientist?

3827
03:08:29.088 --> 03:08:30.560
ASHLEY: Well, if I don't know what it is,

3828
03:08:30.560 --> 03:08:34.230
I would assume that--

3829
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:36.540
I wish I were. That sounds very cool.

3830
03:08:36.540 --> 03:08:38.640
SAM: You lived right around here?

3831
03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:41.030
ASHLEY: Not around here, no, further south.

3832
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:44.291
SAM: This is your home.

3833
03:08:44.291 --> 03:08:47.243
ASHLEY: Oh.

3834
03:08:47.243 --> 03:08:51.497
I put my hood up and just tuck.

3835
03:08:53.570 --> 03:08:55.740
MATT: You guys get closer and closer until eventually

3836
03:08:55.740 --> 03:09:00.616
you and you pick up first because--

3837
03:09:02.007 --> 03:09:05.790
actually Jester, Caleb, Beauregard, and Caduceus all can see

3838
03:09:05.790 --> 03:09:09.290
there's some lazy trails of smoke that break

3839
03:09:09.290 --> 03:09:11.710
the gray skyline ahead of you.

3840
03:09:11.710 --> 03:09:13.710
and above. Following those down,

3841
03:09:13.710 --> 03:09:18.360
you can see a cluster of tents

3842
03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:22.610
or cloth abodes of some kind.

3843
03:09:22.610 --> 03:09:24.293
You can see little elements

3844
03:09:24.293 --> 03:09:28.870
that look like small, temporary domiciles.

3845
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:30.620
TALIESIN: It's clean smoke, not "Oh god,

3846
03:09:30.620 --> 03:09:31.670
something has just caught fire"--

3847
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:36.212
MATT: It's clean smoke. Yeah, it's like white gray.

3848
03:09:38.004 --> 03:09:39.104
MARISHA: This could be the mine.

3849
03:09:39.104 --> 03:09:41.192
TALIESIN: Could be the mine. At the very least, it's a--

3850
03:09:41.192 --> 03:09:43.258
LAURA: (like Gimli) A mine!

3851
03:09:43.258 --> 03:09:45.894
(laughter)

3852
03:09:45.894 --> 03:09:46.727
TALIESIN: At the very least,

3853
03:09:46.727 --> 03:09:49.780
it's somewhere to rest for a spell.

3854
03:09:49.780 --> 03:09:53.490
MATT: As you get closer, you begin to make the details of it

3855
03:09:53.490 --> 03:09:58.438
to see a host of tents, workers and soldiers.

3856
03:09:58.438 --> 03:10:00.015
SAM: Hey.

3857
03:10:00.015 --> 03:10:03.090
MATT: They're settled haphazardly upon the hard, rocky floor

3858
03:10:03.090 --> 03:10:08.090
of this valley. The somewhat disheveled folk

3859
03:10:08.240 --> 03:10:09.880
pile their tools on the one end

3860
03:10:09.880 --> 03:10:12.622
and their weapons on the other.

3861
03:10:12.622 --> 03:10:14.370
You can see the presence of Aurora Watch soldiers

3862
03:10:14.370 --> 03:10:17.452
is minimal. As you get close, you can see about 14 or so

3863
03:10:17.452 --> 03:10:22.452
soldiers with a hundred plus miners, smelters,

3864
03:10:23.760 --> 03:10:28.225
forge workers and other worker folk.

3865
03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:32.493
Do you approach?

3866
03:10:32.493 --> 03:10:36.270
LIAM: Why don't you introduce us?

3867
03:10:36.270 --> 03:10:38.187
TRAVIS: To who, the miners?

3868
03:10:38.187 --> 03:10:39.315
SAM: Yeah, we need to know where

3869
03:10:39.315 --> 03:10:41.420
these giants are, someone's got to ask.

3870
03:10:41.420 --> 03:10:43.603
TRAVIS: All right. Do we spot

3871
03:10:43.603 --> 03:10:47.077
a more sizable tent amongst them?

3872
03:10:47.077 --> 03:10:49.401
MATT: Make a perception check.

3873
03:10:50.628 --> 03:10:51.903
TRAVIS: 13.

3874
03:10:51.903 --> 03:10:55.210
MATT: Yeah, as you begin to approach, the moorbounders

3875
03:10:55.210 --> 03:10:57.570
slowing down a bit, there are definitely people

3876
03:10:57.570 --> 03:11:00.860
glancing off and seeing you approach. Once again,

3877
03:11:00.860 --> 03:11:03.360
moorbounders aren't common this far east, and so people

3878
03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:05.230
stop what they're doing. They're like, "What is going on?"

3879
03:11:05.230 --> 03:11:08.360
It's still a commotion. You do see one tent

3880
03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:11.470
that is larger than the rest.

3881
03:11:11.470 --> 03:11:13.500
It looks a little damaged. It looks like part of it

3882
03:11:13.500 --> 03:11:17.190
is shredded and has been stitched shut.

3883
03:11:17.190 --> 03:11:21.880
Quick patchwork job, but it is larger than most.

3884
03:11:21.880 --> 03:11:24.880
You guys approach on moorbounder back.

3885
03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:26.280
One of the Aurora Watch guards looks out

3886
03:11:26.280 --> 03:11:28.220
and sees you begin to approach

3887
03:11:28.220 --> 03:11:33.220
and darts towards the tent and then comes back out with

3888
03:11:33.693 --> 03:11:38.693
two of the other Aurora guards. You see an older drow.

3889
03:11:39.930 --> 03:11:43.210
He's male with shoulder-length hair

3890
03:11:43.210 --> 03:11:46.570
and a goatee that looks a little scraggly.

3891
03:11:46.570 --> 03:11:49.070
He has hard facial features, he's a bit plump.

3892
03:11:49.935 --> 03:11:51.950
You can see dirt and sweat dappled around the corners

3893
03:11:51.950 --> 03:11:55.510
of the face. Otherwise, seems to be well kept

3894
03:11:55.510 --> 03:11:59.060
and clean. He's dressed in

3895
03:11:59.060 --> 03:12:04.060
a standard tunic, nice pants

3896
03:12:04.636 --> 03:12:06.372
and he seems to be wearing quite a bit of jewelry

3897
03:12:06.372 --> 03:12:07.990
compared to the rest of the folk here.

3898
03:12:07.990 --> 03:12:10.450
He approaches with the rest of the Aurora Watch guard.

3899
03:12:10.450 --> 03:12:14.960
He looks over. "Can I help you? Can any of you

3900
03:12:14.960 --> 03:12:17.260
"please tell me what you are doing here?"

3901
03:12:17.260 --> 03:12:20.110
TRAVIS: We're here to see the foreman.

3902
03:12:20.110 --> 03:12:22.280
MATT: "You've found the foreman."

3903
03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:23.113
TRAVIS: Oh.

3904
03:12:23.113 --> 03:12:25.640
MATT: "What is your business here?"

3905
03:12:25.640 --> 03:12:28.898
TRAVIS: Good for you. We've been sent here

3906
03:12:28.898 --> 03:12:31.920
on behalf of Professor Waccoh.

3907
03:12:31.920 --> 03:12:34.510
MATT: "Oh really, by the professor?"

3908
03:12:34.510 --> 03:12:35.670
TRAVIS: Yep.

3909
03:12:35.670 --> 03:12:40.320
MATT: "Well, that is fantastic. Wonderful, even.

3910
03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:41.580
"Why did she send you here?"

3911
03:12:41.580 --> 03:12:42.990
TRAVIS: I love your enthusiasm.

3912
03:12:42.990 --> 03:12:45.020
Apparently you have a giant problem.

3913
03:12:45.020 --> 03:12:47.960
MATT: "Well, there is a problem, but I do not know

3914
03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:52.400
"if it is necessarily one that you seven

3915
03:12:52.400 --> 03:12:55.653
could necessarily--
SAM: We're giant killers.

3916
03:12:55.653 --> 03:12:57.984
We've killed giants before, we can kill this one.

3917
03:12:57.984 --> 03:12:59.768
LAURA: So many giants, that's our specialty.

3918
03:12:59.768 --> 03:13:04.220
MATT: "Really? That is very difficult to believe.

3919
03:13:04.220 --> 03:13:06.020
"I mean no offense, but--"

3920
03:13:06.020 --> 03:13:11.020
MARISHA: Jester, pull out the heart.

3921
03:13:11.280 --> 03:13:13.060
SAM: Oh boy.

3922
03:13:13.060 --> 03:13:14.360
MATT: "What am I looking at?"

3923
03:13:14.360 --> 03:13:16.510
LAURA: See this sludgy heart?

3924
03:13:16.510 --> 03:13:17.826
MATT: "I see it, yes. You brought it and

3925
03:13:17.826 --> 03:13:18.890
put it in front of me."

3926
03:13:18.890 --> 03:13:23.014
LAURA: It's from a giant monster.

3927
03:13:23.014 --> 03:13:24.839
I put it back in the bag.

3928
03:13:24.839 --> 03:13:27.540
(laughter)

3929
03:13:27.540 --> 03:13:29.598
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

3930
03:13:29.598 --> 03:13:30.760
SAM: Don't look at it too long.

3931
03:13:30.760 --> 03:13:33.410
LAURA: It's real sludgy.

3932
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:35.630
God dang it.

3933
03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:37.324
SAM: Oh boy.

3934
03:13:37.324 --> 03:13:39.064
LAURA: Ow ow ow!

3935
03:13:39.064 --> 03:13:42.072
MATT: He goes, "Oh! Ha ha, very scary,

3936
03:13:42.072 --> 03:13:43.397
"that monster you killed,

3937
03:13:43.397 --> 03:13:48.397
"I guess, maybe. (laughs) And how do you intend

3938
03:13:48.510 --> 03:13:51.750
"to kill these giants, if I might be so curious?"

3939
03:13:51.750 --> 03:13:55.033
TRAVIS: How many are there?

3940
03:13:55.033 --> 03:13:56.870
MATT: "Are you the leader?"

3941
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:58.340
LAURA: Yes, he's our captain.
SAM: I mean, no.

3942
03:13:58.340 --> 03:14:01.680
LAURA: He's our really strong, really smart captain.

3943
03:14:01.680 --> 03:14:03.329
TRAVIS: For someone who's on the chopping block,

3944
03:14:03.329 --> 03:14:04.660
you ask a lot of questions

3945
03:14:04.660 --> 03:14:07.700
of the privileged favorites of the Bright Queen.

3946
03:14:07.700 --> 03:14:10.870
MATT: "Chopping block, not at all, we are merely awaiting--"

3947
03:14:10.870 --> 03:14:14.370
TRAVIS: We? I'm talking about you, friend.

3948
03:14:14.370 --> 03:14:16.440
You have not done a very good job here

3949
03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:18.400
and we're here to fix it for you.

3950
03:14:18.400 --> 03:14:20.280
MATT: "I--"
TRAVIS: I would stop talking

3951
03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:21.700
if I were you. How many giants

3952
03:14:21.700 --> 03:14:24.592
have you seen in the past month?

3953
03:14:24.592 --> 03:14:26.440
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

3954
03:14:26.440 --> 03:14:28.291
LAURA: Roll better!

3955
03:14:28.291 --> 03:14:30.610
TRAVIS: 27.
LAURA: Oh shit!

3956
03:14:30.610 --> 03:14:31.535
TALIESIN: I love you.

3957
03:14:31.535 --> 03:14:34.889
SAM: Better than a one.
LAURA: A little bit.

3958
03:14:34.889 --> 03:14:36.972
MATT: He goes, "Oh."

3959
03:14:36.972 --> 03:14:40.669
The guards actually look over like, "Oh shit!"

3960
03:14:40.669 --> 03:14:44.920
He's like, "Well, there was an unfortunate--"

3961
03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:46.195
TRAVIS: Sorry?
MATT: (louder) "There was an

3962
03:14:46.195 --> 03:14:49.650
"unfortunate incursion of what we count to be

3963
03:14:49.650 --> 03:14:54.320
"about seven or eight giants.

3964
03:14:55.450 --> 03:14:59.070
"They came down from the mountain without warning,

3965
03:14:59.070 --> 03:15:03.300
"stormed into the middle of our mining encampment

3966
03:15:03.300 --> 03:15:06.651
"as well as the Steelworks and began to just toss

3967
03:15:06.651 --> 03:15:11.651
"and destroy. We fought back valiantly, lost many men,

3968
03:15:11.710 --> 03:15:13.976
"and escaped with our lives

3969
03:15:13.976 --> 03:15:15.940
"and a good amount of our equipment."

3970
03:15:15.940 --> 03:15:17.880
TRAVIS: What do you have to show for this encounter?

3971
03:15:17.880 --> 03:15:21.046
MATT: "We have sent word to Rosohna."

3972
03:15:21.046 --> 03:15:22.637
TRAVIS: How many did you kill?

3973
03:15:22.637 --> 03:15:24.880
MATT: "We have not killed any yet,

3974
03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:26.560
"because we are awaiting reinforcements--"

3975
03:15:26.560 --> 03:15:28.290
TRAVIS: You are wearing a lot of jewelry for someone

3976
03:15:28.290 --> 03:15:29.215
that does not--

3977
03:15:29.215 --> 03:15:30.631
MATT: "I have earned this."

3978
03:15:30.631 --> 03:15:32.880
TRAVIS: If you raise your voice one more time,

3979
03:15:32.880 --> 03:15:36.068
we might just have to take you back with us.

3980
03:15:36.068 --> 03:15:37.830
(laughter)

3981
03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:39.440
You don't get to talk anymore.

3982
03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:41.290
Anybody else can point us in the direction

3983
03:15:41.290 --> 03:15:44.988
of these giants so we can help you keep your job?

3984
03:15:45.860 --> 03:15:48.120
MATT: "Ahem."

3985
03:15:48.120 --> 03:15:50.489
The other guards look at each other.

3986
03:15:50.489 --> 03:15:52.390
TALIESIN: Captain Fjord.

3987
03:15:52.390 --> 03:15:53.223
TRAVIS: Yes?

3988
03:15:53.223 --> 03:15:55.220
TALIESIN: Perhaps also if there are some witnesses

3989
03:15:55.220 --> 03:15:59.040
to the actual event who were of sound mind

3990
03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:02.400
to perhaps see what kind of giants these were

3991
03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:04.850
and if they were armed or otherwise, if they seemed

3992
03:16:04.850 --> 03:16:06.850
to be interested in something in the mines.

3993
03:16:06.850 --> 03:16:08.858
TRAVIS: Foreman, did you manage to keep

3994
03:16:08.858 --> 03:16:11.110
any of your workers alive?

3995
03:16:11.110 --> 03:16:12.070
MATT: "Yes, there are many around--"

3996
03:16:12.070 --> 03:16:15.953
LAURA: He told you not to talk anymore.

3997
03:16:17.650 --> 03:16:20.466
TALIESIN: I think--

3998
03:16:23.640 --> 03:16:27.265
TRAVIS: You can point.

3999
03:16:29.061 --> 03:16:30.063
MATT: He points to the rest of the

4000
03:16:30.063 --> 03:16:31.975
entire grouping of people around.

4001
03:16:31.975 --> 03:16:34.020
TRAVIS: Hm.

4002
03:16:34.020 --> 03:16:36.190
Tell you what.

4003
03:16:36.190 --> 03:16:37.870
Since my lieutenant over here

4004
03:16:37.870 --> 03:16:40.960
is tired of hearing you speak, why don't you go find

4005
03:16:40.960 --> 03:16:41.793
someone that can give us

4006
03:16:41.793 --> 03:16:44.893
a first hand account of what happened.

4007
03:16:44.893 --> 03:16:46.451
Now.

4008
03:16:49.346 --> 03:16:52.070
MATT: (coughs) He turns around and walks away

4009
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:53.670
all the--
TRAVIS: We're supposed

4010
03:16:53.670 --> 03:16:54.778
to embarrass him, right?

4011
03:16:54.778 --> 03:16:56.780
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like that counts.

4012
03:16:56.780 --> 03:16:58.197
SAM: We're supposed to--
LAURA: Yeah, yeah!

4013
03:16:58.197 --> 03:16:59.163
SAM: Oh.

4014
03:16:59.163 --> 03:17:00.712
MATT: The three Aurora Watch standing there,

4015
03:17:00.712 --> 03:17:03.015
taken aback by this looking at you like--

4016
03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:09.730
Eventually he returns with another one of

4017
03:17:09.730 --> 03:17:12.445
the workers in the vicinity, younger.

4018
03:17:12.445 --> 03:17:16.845
You see an orc,

4019
03:17:16.845 --> 03:17:20.977
maybe in his late teens, early 20s,

4020
03:17:20.977 --> 03:17:22.968
has a bit of a wound on his shoulder

4021
03:17:22.968 --> 03:17:26.190
that's currently bandaged up and he looks a bit bruised.

4022
03:17:26.190 --> 03:17:29.920
Hair is long and over one eye and dirty

4023
03:17:29.920 --> 03:17:33.053
approaches and goes,

4024
03:17:33.053 --> 03:17:37.320
"Hi, what is there a question?"

4025
03:17:37.320 --> 03:17:38.963
TRAVIS: How you doing, son?
MATT: "Answer the man."

4026
03:17:38.963 --> 03:17:43.654
TRAVIS: Could you tell us what happened to you?

4027
03:17:43.654 --> 03:17:48.270
MATT: "I, yeah, we were all working as we normally do

4028
03:17:48.270 --> 03:17:52.460
"and then there was some loud crushing, grinding noise

4029
03:17:52.460 --> 03:17:56.970
"and over the wall these big gray giants

4030
03:17:56.970 --> 03:18:01.490
"started storming past the outskirts of the outpost

4031
03:18:01.490 --> 03:18:04.320
"and they started just yelling.

4032
03:18:04.320 --> 03:18:08.140
We tried to fight them back and they started stomping.

4033
03:18:08.140 --> 03:18:10.930
"They hurt and killed a few people

4034
03:18:10.930 --> 03:18:14.080
"and we hurt a couple of them, but they were--

4035
03:18:14.080 --> 03:18:17.220
"We just grabbed our things and ran

4036
03:18:17.220 --> 03:18:20.710
"and they've been there for well over seven days,

4037
03:18:20.710 --> 03:18:25.710
"eight days now and we're just supposedly, right?"

4038
03:18:25.720 --> 03:18:26.970
Looks over to the foreman.

4039
03:18:26.970 --> 03:18:31.690
"Waiting on more soldier reinforcements."

4040
03:18:31.690 --> 03:18:36.040
"That is correct and had we not sent most of our

4041
03:18:36.040 --> 03:18:40.300
"recently nearby forces west to the front lines,

4042
03:18:40.300 --> 03:18:43.450
"we would have more available to help in this endeavor,

4043
03:18:43.450 --> 03:18:47.170
"but I am certain they are coming. Thank you."

4044
03:18:47.170 --> 03:18:49.770
The orc turns around and heads back.

4045
03:18:49.770 --> 03:18:52.842
ASHLEY: So you did not fight them, you ran?

4046
03:18:52.842 --> 03:18:53.675
MATT: "There was the fighting,

4047
03:18:53.675 --> 03:18:58.150
"but we have soldiers intended to keep things at bay

4048
03:18:58.150 --> 03:19:01.680
"like the spiders and the other creatures that

4049
03:19:01.680 --> 03:19:03.594
"exist in the forest. We weren't expecting

4050
03:19:03.594 --> 03:19:06.960
"that many giants out of nowhere to attack.

4051
03:19:06.960 --> 03:19:11.030
"We didn't have the means to defend ourselves."

4052
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.920
TRAVIS: Well--
MATT: "You say you were

4053
03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:16.820
"sent by the professor, correct? Is--heh.

4054
03:19:20.217 --> 03:19:22.433
"She thinks you can handle this better than we could

4055
03:19:22.433 --> 03:19:25.230
"and I'll tell you what. If you manage to do this

4056
03:19:25.230 --> 03:19:28.880
"and make it under the banner of Den Icozrin,

4057
03:19:29.910 --> 03:19:33.690
"bring me along when you return, and tell her

4058
03:19:33.690 --> 03:19:37.100
"that to her face, I'll beat her offer

4059
03:19:37.100 --> 03:19:40.730
"with an additional 20% whatever she's paying."

4060
03:19:40.730 --> 03:19:42.780
TRAVIS: I like what you're wearing around your neck.

4061
03:19:42.780 --> 03:19:44.813
I'll have that.

4062
03:19:44.813 --> 03:19:46.180
MATT: "Do we have a deal?"

4063
03:19:46.180 --> 03:19:49.500
TRAVIS: I said I'll have that.

4064
03:19:49.500 --> 03:19:52.390
MATT: Make another intimidation check.

4065
03:19:54.720 --> 03:19:56.698
TRAVIS: 16.

4066
03:19:58.425 --> 03:20:00.840
17.
MATT: 17, he's like--

4067
03:20:02.140 --> 03:20:05.772
TALIESIN: Thaumaturgy in the eyes.

4068
03:20:05.772 --> 03:20:07.890
They start to go a little cloudy.

4069
03:20:07.890 --> 03:20:10.681
TRAVIS: Mine do?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4070
03:20:11.780 --> 03:20:13.463
Asshole.

4071
03:20:15.650 --> 03:20:20.157
MATT: He grasps at his necklace and is like,

4072
03:20:20.157 --> 03:20:25.157
"I don't know where the professor found such thugs,

4073
03:20:26.170 --> 03:20:29.486
"but you do not want to mess

4074
03:20:29.486 --> 03:20:33.290
with Den Icozrin, all right?

4075
03:20:33.290 --> 03:20:38.290
"I'm offering you a chance to make more money.

4076
03:20:38.860 --> 03:20:40.520
"Now, based on how you've arrived,

4077
03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:44.180
"it appears to me that you are sell swords, yes?

4078
03:20:45.200 --> 03:20:48.180
SAM: Sure.
MATT: "I can pay you more."

4079
03:20:48.180 --> 03:20:52.910
LIAM: Jannik strides slowly up to this man's big tent

4080
03:20:52.910 --> 03:20:56.890
and Caleb leans over and says: Piss.

4081
03:20:56.890 --> 03:20:58.920
And Jannik's back leg

4082
03:20:58.920 --> 03:21:01.990
comes up and a stream of urine starts running

4083
03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:04.640
down the side of his tent.

4084
03:21:04.640 --> 03:21:06.160
TRAVIS: You've been out here for an awful long while.

4085
03:21:06.160 --> 03:21:08.980
You seem to think that you're still in good favor

4086
03:21:08.980 --> 03:21:12.200
with your Den, is that appropriate?

4087
03:21:12.200 --> 03:21:14.790
TRAVIS: Make a deception check.

4088
03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:17.460
TRAVIS: 19.
MATT: 19?

4089
03:21:20.470 --> 03:21:23.152
"I, what--"

4090
03:21:23.152 --> 03:21:26.740
TRAVIS: Such a long way information can get lost so easily.

4091
03:21:26.740 --> 03:21:29.228
MATT: "You're bluffing.

4092
03:21:29.228 --> 03:21:31.267
"You're bluffing, no.

4093
03:21:36.520 --> 03:21:39.847
"25%."
TRAVIS: Keep the necklace.

4094
03:21:39.847 --> 03:21:43.530
You'll need it, all right, let's get started.

4095
03:21:43.530 --> 03:21:45.488
MARISHA: Let's go.

4096
03:21:47.220 --> 03:21:49.950
MATT: "Good luck."

4097
03:21:49.950 --> 03:21:53.392
TRAVIS: You don't need to be wishing us good luck.

4098
03:21:54.508 --> 03:21:56.666
And we walk away.

4099
03:21:56.666 --> 03:21:58.640
MATT: As you guys turn the corner

4100
03:21:58.640 --> 03:22:03.640
you can see about another 20 or so of the nearby folk

4101
03:22:03.787 --> 03:22:05.850
who have just been waiting around.

4102
03:22:05.850 --> 03:22:07.370
They're not working. They can't do anything here,

4103
03:22:07.370 --> 03:22:10.870
so they're just sitting and talking and biding their time

4104
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:14.560
have all gathered nearby to watch these last few moments

4105
03:22:14.560 --> 03:22:17.100
of involvement and as soon as you guys meander

4106
03:22:17.100 --> 03:22:20.020
around the corner you hear a voice go,

4107
03:22:20.020 --> 03:22:23.111
"Well, what are you doing? Scatter!"

4108
03:22:23.111 --> 03:22:25.677
Some muttering and voices and--

4109
03:22:25.677 --> 03:22:27.790
SAM: That was impressive.
LAURA: Wow.

4110
03:22:27.790 --> 03:22:28.806
SAM: Very impressive.

4111
03:22:28.806 --> 03:22:31.456
LAURA: That was the most intimidating I've ever seen you be.

4112
03:22:31.456 --> 03:22:33.230
TALIESIN: That was very nice.

4113
03:22:33.230 --> 03:22:37.141
SAM: How do we kill seven giants?

4114
03:22:37.141 --> 03:22:39.340
TRAVIS: Oh, we're still doing that part?

4115
03:22:39.340 --> 03:22:41.059
SAM: I think we have to now.

4116
03:22:41.059 --> 03:22:42.000
TRAVIS: I was just focusing on the embarrassing part.

4117
03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:43.800
SAM: You did that perfectly.

4118
03:22:43.800 --> 03:22:45.940
LIAM: It's just the cherry on top, we do have to

4119
03:22:45.940 --> 03:22:47.540
take care of the giants.

4120
03:22:47.540 --> 03:22:49.331
TALIESIN: Perhaps take a look at the situation.

4121
03:22:49.331 --> 03:22:52.122
Also, gray giants, I don't know what kind of giants.

4122
03:22:52.122 --> 03:22:54.580
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, probably should have gotten more

4123
03:22:54.580 --> 03:22:56.230
details and all that.

4124
03:22:56.230 --> 03:22:57.640
TALIESIN: I think that's what we were going to get.

4125
03:22:57.640 --> 03:23:00.000
LIAM: Yeah, but you put on a very good show back there.

4126
03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:02.040
I don't think we want to--

4127
03:23:02.040 --> 03:23:04.060
ASHLEY: That alone.
LIAM: Jiggle that, yeah.

4128
03:23:04.060 --> 03:23:06.660
MARISHA: We can scout and just watch for a minute.

4129
03:23:06.660 --> 03:23:08.426
LAURA: Maybe we can talk to the giants

4130
03:23:08.426 --> 03:23:09.268
and make them hate each other

4131
03:23:09.268 --> 03:23:11.240
and then they'll fight each other and then they might--

4132
03:23:11.240 --> 03:23:13.240
SAM: Also, they want something specific that we could

4133
03:23:13.240 --> 03:23:16.540
help them get. I don't know.

4134
03:23:16.540 --> 03:23:18.131
LIAM: They also might be dumb as rocks.

4135
03:23:18.131 --> 03:23:19.657
We'll have to find out.

4136
03:23:19.657 --> 03:23:23.600
ASHLEY: Do the gray giants sound familiar to me at all?

4137
03:23:23.600 --> 03:23:25.230
MATT: You've not encountered them in your time.

4138
03:23:25.230 --> 03:23:29.910
You haven't spent your time in the vicinity of a place

4139
03:23:29.910 --> 03:23:32.980
that might house these. You've spent most of your life

4140
03:23:32.980 --> 03:23:37.980
in the Iothia Moorlands far south of here

4141
03:23:38.505 --> 03:23:43.000
and you've not encountered a gray giant necessarily.

4142
03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:47.160
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know what the hell that is.

4143
03:23:47.160 --> 03:23:48.323
TALIESIN: We're going to need some intel,

4144
03:23:48.323 --> 03:23:50.773
some proper intel then.

4145
03:23:50.773 --> 03:23:51.948
We're going to need to take a look

4146
03:23:51.948 --> 03:23:53.429
at these things firsthand,

4147
03:23:53.429 --> 03:23:56.930
maybe get a sense of how big they are.

4148
03:23:59.240 --> 03:24:00.700
I don't know what they want.

4149
03:24:00.700 --> 03:24:05.210
TRAVIS: Do these moorbounders track? Scent?

4150
03:24:05.210 --> 03:24:09.427
LAURA: Yarnball? Do you track?

4151
03:24:11.024 --> 03:24:12.406
MATT: (slurps)

4152
03:24:12.406 --> 03:24:14.466
TALIESIN: I can ask.
LAURA: Oh yeah!.

4153
03:24:14.466 --> 03:24:19.462
TALIESIN: Hey Yarnball. I know: weird.

4154
03:24:20.660 --> 03:24:24.100
If you smell something that we're looking for,

4155
03:24:24.100 --> 03:24:26.100
like a creature, could you tell

4156
03:24:26.100 --> 03:24:29.420
where the creature was just by smelling it?

4157
03:24:29.420 --> 03:24:32.420
Seems pretty positive about that.

4158
03:24:32.420 --> 03:24:33.925
That's super cool.

4159
03:24:33.925 --> 03:24:35.191
SAM: We don't have anything that smells

4160
03:24:35.191 --> 03:24:36.892
like the creature that we want.

4161
03:24:36.892 --> 03:24:38.400
TALIESIN: We're going to be hunting

4162
03:24:38.400 --> 03:24:42.216
some very dangerous things, but we'll--

4163
03:24:42.216 --> 03:24:43.691
MATT: (snorts)

4164
03:24:43.691 --> 03:24:45.657
TALIESIN: Yeah. we'll make sure that you

4165
03:24:45.657 --> 03:24:48.900
get a taste of something.

4166
03:24:48.900 --> 03:24:53.198
LAURA: Can you fight? You want to fight giants with us?

4167
03:24:55.263 --> 03:24:56.600
Ah, I think that's a yes.

4168
03:24:56.600 --> 03:24:58.760
TALIESIN: They don't actually know what you're saying.

4169
03:24:58.760 --> 03:24:59.593
MATT: They have no idea what you're saying.

4170
03:24:59.593 --> 03:25:02.024
LAURA: Oh, ask if they want to fight giants with us?

4171
03:25:02.024 --> 03:25:05.299
TALIESIN: Want to fight some giants?

4172
03:25:05.299 --> 03:25:06.450
MATT: (growling)

4173
03:25:06.450 --> 03:25:09.283
TALIESIN: They don't know what giants are.

4174
03:25:10.461 --> 03:25:12.194
Never seen one before.

4175
03:25:12.194 --> 03:25:14.026
They have no context in the--

4176
03:25:14.026 --> 03:25:15.584
TRAVIS: Do we want to head over to the direction

4177
03:25:15.584 --> 03:25:17.600
of maybe some destruction and try to pick it up?

4178
03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:19.793
SAM: Let's do it, let's do it.

4179
03:25:19.793 --> 03:25:22.810
TALIESIN: Let's go see if we can get a look at these things?

4180
03:25:22.810 --> 03:25:25.770
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go there.

4181
03:25:25.770 --> 03:25:28.060
SAM: I'm ready to kill.

4182
03:25:29.620 --> 03:25:33.900
MATT: All right. First off, what's the marching order here?

4183
03:25:33.900 --> 03:25:35.670
TRAVIS: Yarnball's in the front.

4184
03:25:35.670 --> 03:25:38.544
LAURA: Yarnball in the front! Fjord in the front,

4185
03:25:38.544 --> 03:25:40.550
I'm riding behind Fjord and then--

4186
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:43.133
SAM: That's Fjord, Jester, and Nott on Yarnball

4187
03:25:43.133 --> 03:25:43.966
in the front.

4188
03:25:43.966 --> 03:25:45.585
TALIESIN: We'll be in the middle.

4189
03:25:45.585 --> 03:25:46.959
ASHLEY: Caduceus and Yasha in the middle.

4190
03:25:46.959 --> 03:25:51.230
TALIESIN: I'll be keeping my eyes fucking peeled.

4191
03:25:54.109 --> 03:25:55.100
MARISHA: Guess we'll take the rear.

4192
03:25:55.100 --> 03:25:58.020
TALIESIN: Well, that seems very reasonable.

4193
03:25:58.020 --> 03:26:01.960
MATT: You guys begin to you skirt around

4194
03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:06.960
the outside of this cluster of displaced workers and miners.

4195
03:26:08.332 --> 03:26:11.320
Apparently, based on what just happened,

4196
03:26:11.320 --> 03:26:13.480
you can see a number of them are following the perimeter

4197
03:26:13.480 --> 03:26:16.770
and watching you guys leave, both curious,

4198
03:26:16.770 --> 03:26:20.070
and some being like, "Oh shit."

4199
03:26:22.610 --> 03:26:24.620
Till eventually you break the tree line

4200
03:26:24.620 --> 03:26:27.740
heading westward into the Vermaloc.

4201
03:26:27.740 --> 03:26:30.140
Did you have something?

4202
03:26:30.140 --> 03:26:34.692
TALIESIN: I just had a thought. Do we want a guide?

4203
03:26:35.588 --> 03:26:38.010
Do we want a miner who maybe knows the mines

4204
03:26:38.010 --> 03:26:41.070
to quickly show us if there's anything we're going to miss?

4205
03:26:41.070 --> 03:26:43.500
They can send them back before this fighting starts.

4206
03:26:43.500 --> 03:26:45.333
TRAVIS: Sure.

4207
03:26:45.333 --> 03:26:48.155
TALIESIN: Just before we leave camp.

4208
03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:52.220
I'll do the sweet sell.

4209
03:26:53.570 --> 03:26:55.120
Before we head off, is there anyone

4210
03:26:55.120 --> 03:26:57.793
who's feeling particularly brave?

4211
03:26:57.793 --> 03:26:58.730
There might be a little coin in it for you.

4212
03:26:58.730 --> 03:27:00.080
We don't need a fighter,

4213
03:27:00.080 --> 03:27:03.570
we just would love somebody who has a particular

4214
03:27:03.570 --> 03:27:05.820
understanding of the territory, maybe somebody

4215
03:27:05.820 --> 03:27:07.410
who really feels like they know the mines.

4216
03:27:07.410 --> 03:27:08.940
We're not ask you to guide.

4217
03:27:08.940 --> 03:27:11.260
We're going to try and keep you out of the way.

4218
03:27:11.260 --> 03:27:14.780
We just we would love somebody who really knows the land.

4219
03:27:14.780 --> 03:27:18.630
MATT: This motley crew of characters

4220
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:20.518
look amongst each other.

4221
03:27:20.518 --> 03:27:22.120
A lot of them seem relatively shellshocked, or at least

4222
03:27:22.120 --> 03:27:24.950
not interested in going back to whatever transpired.

4223
03:27:24.950 --> 03:27:26.040
One of them steps forward.

4224
03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:31.040
You see a hobgoblin, which--I would say

4225
03:27:31.690 --> 03:27:35.510
from your experience--a unique--orcish in stature

4226
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:38.831
in the fact that it is tall and is broad,

4227
03:27:38.831 --> 03:27:43.481
but a wide nose,

4228
03:27:43.481 --> 03:27:47.580
a deep reddish brown skin,

4229
03:27:47.580 --> 03:27:51.790
darker red hair pulled in a loose ponytail in the back

4230
03:27:51.790 --> 03:27:53.784
and just general clothes and steps forward

4231
03:27:53.784 --> 03:27:57.920
and goes, "I'll help for coin."

4232
03:27:57.920 --> 03:28:01.940
TALIESIN: Sure, is everybody just out of curiosity,

4233
03:28:01.940 --> 03:28:04.465
do you all feel that this--what's your name, friend?

4234
03:28:04.465 --> 03:28:06.270
MATT: "Derman."

4235
03:28:06.270 --> 03:28:08.870
TALIESIN: That Derman is a fine representation of the best

4236
03:28:08.870 --> 03:28:12.550
of what makes a fine miner in this community?

4237
03:28:13.580 --> 03:28:18.195
TALIESIN: Seeing if everyone seems like they like the guy.

4238
03:28:18.195 --> 03:28:20.485
MATT: They all laugh, he's like (shushing).

4239
03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:24.490
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's coin involved and we'll try

4240
03:28:24.490 --> 03:28:28.948
and keep you out of--hmm.

4241
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:34.040
MATT: "I ain't no dummy."

4242
03:28:34.040 --> 03:28:35.623
TALIESIN: Oh, no. you're very fair.

4243
03:28:35.623 --> 03:28:40.623
How does, let's say-- This is dangerous.

4244
03:28:40.631 --> 03:28:45.379
I suppose four gold now and four more on completion?

4245
03:28:45.379 --> 03:28:49.837
MATT: "Deal.

4246
03:28:49.837 --> 03:28:54.837
"All right, am I riding on one of your beasts?"

4247
03:28:55.430 --> 03:28:56.800
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4248
03:28:56.800 --> 03:28:59.422
LIAM: We have room in the back.

4249
03:29:01.620 --> 03:29:03.159
SAM: How about the middle one?

4250
03:29:03.159 --> 03:29:06.850
LAURA: Can't they ride with him and her?

4251
03:29:06.850 --> 03:29:10.660
ASHLEY: Yeah, you can get in with the middle of us.

4252
03:29:10.660 --> 03:29:11.840
MATT: "I'll walk."

4253
03:29:11.840 --> 03:29:14.780
TALIESIN: We're going to be kind of fast.

4254
03:29:14.780 --> 03:29:18.417
MATT: "Who's guiding you?"
TALIESIN: Touché.

4255
03:29:18.417 --> 03:29:21.280
LAURA: You're going to be kind of slow.

4256
03:29:21.280 --> 03:29:23.490
TALIESIN: Lead on.

4257
03:29:23.490 --> 03:29:26.074
MATT: He goes and grabs a satchel.

4258
03:29:26.074 --> 03:29:28.230
He's kind of ballsy for a worker here.

4259
03:29:28.230 --> 03:29:29.280
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

4260
03:29:29.280 --> 03:29:31.484
MATT: Throws it over his shoulder

4261
03:29:31.484 --> 03:29:34.004
and begins to lead you guys

4262
03:29:34.004 --> 03:29:36.900
into the Vermaloc. A slower pace than you were hoping for,

4263
03:29:36.900 --> 03:29:39.350
but nevertheless, that's what happens when you have a guide

4264
03:29:39.350 --> 03:29:42.785
that apparently doesn't want to ride with you.

4265
03:29:43.685 --> 03:29:46.320
This is certainly not like any forest you've ever seen.

4266
03:29:46.320 --> 03:29:50.640
The thick leaves and canopy is about ten, 12 feet

4267
03:29:50.640 --> 03:29:53.680
off the compost, heavy forest floor is comprised of

4268
03:29:53.680 --> 03:29:58.680
a vibrant net of deep reds, oranges, and maroon leaves

4269
03:29:58.960 --> 03:30:02.040
sprouting from smooth-barked trees of purple wood.

4270
03:30:02.040 --> 03:30:04.600
Heavy roots bulk at the base of the tree about four

4271
03:30:04.600 --> 03:30:06.800
feet off the ground, then spring outwards,

4272
03:30:06.800 --> 03:30:09.430
some leaving tiny entrances to small hollows

4273
03:30:09.430 --> 03:30:14.120
that are shaded within and below the tree.

4274
03:30:14.120 --> 03:30:16.407
It's like a hidden chambers.

4275
03:30:16.407 --> 03:30:19.866
The foliage and the tall brown red ferns that clutter

4276
03:30:19.866 --> 03:30:22.860
the vicinity and the space are occasionally broken by

4277
03:30:22.860 --> 03:30:24.040
bright yellow flowers that

4278
03:30:24.040 --> 03:30:27.472
poke through in these large clusters.

4279
03:30:28.741 --> 03:30:30.260
You can see jutting rock formations occasionally

4280
03:30:30.260 --> 03:30:33.120
like somebody had punched a section of the earth beneath

4281
03:30:33.120 --> 03:30:38.120
and sticking up like so many large heavy monoliths

4282
03:30:38.490 --> 03:30:41.200
that are naturally formed.

4283
03:30:41.200 --> 03:30:44.030
The air has a strange mix of fermenting mulch

4284
03:30:44.030 --> 03:30:46.763
and a sweet perfume

4285
03:30:46.763 --> 03:30:51.237
and it's eerily quiet

4286
03:30:51.237 --> 03:30:53.462
and beautiful.

4287
03:30:53.462 --> 03:30:57.090
Yasha, you've been in this forest before,

4288
03:30:57.090 --> 03:30:59.720
though around the other side of the Penumbra Range

4289
03:30:59.720 --> 03:31:04.720
and the furthest southern area.

4290
03:31:05.120 --> 03:31:09.330
Your memory of this forest generally at this point

4291
03:31:09.330 --> 03:31:13.570
isn't clean. It's usually more web-tattered.

4292
03:31:15.676 --> 03:31:16.960
ASHLEY: Ah.
MATT: You're like,

4293
03:31:16.960 --> 03:31:19.540
"This nice that it's a little more clear,"

4294
03:31:19.540 --> 03:31:21.690
especially as you go deeper and deeper.

4295
03:31:24.798 --> 03:31:27.840
Quietly, your hobgoblin

4296
03:31:27.840 --> 03:31:30.990
guide begins to continue leading you through.

4297
03:31:30.990 --> 03:31:34.850
I would like all of the moorbounders to

4298
03:31:34.850 --> 03:31:37.609
make stealth checks for me, please,

4299
03:31:37.609 --> 03:31:39.025
since they're the ones who are actually journeying forward.

4300
03:31:39.025 --> 03:31:40.992
LIAM: I'm throwing up Mage Armor, too.

4301
03:31:40.992 --> 03:31:41.840
MATT: Okay.

4302
03:31:41.840 --> 03:31:44.760
TALIESIN: Oh, I ruined everything.

4303
03:31:44.760 --> 03:31:48.148
Does a moorbounder get an extra bonus to stealth or?

4304
03:31:48.148 --> 03:31:52.122
MATT: It should on the sheet that I gave to one of you,

4305
03:31:52.122 --> 03:31:54.301
it has the moorbounder stats, you should have it.

4306
03:31:54.301 --> 03:31:57.130
LAURA: Ah yeah, dexterity plus zero.

4307
03:31:57.130 --> 03:32:00.263
TALIESIN: So just a straight--
LAURA: Straight roll.

4308
03:32:03.952 --> 03:32:06.178
SAM: I don't have to roll.

4309
03:32:06.178 --> 03:32:08.306
TALIESIN: Well, that's better than it could have been.

4310
03:32:09.200 --> 03:32:11.370
LAURA: 14.
TALIESIN: Nine.

4311
03:32:11.370 --> 03:32:12.710
LIAM: 17.
MATT: Okay.

4312
03:32:13.620 --> 03:32:17.380
Universally, it balanced out to be fair.

4313
03:32:18.820 --> 03:32:21.510
You continue to push forward

4314
03:32:21.510 --> 03:32:26.308
for about 25 minutes or so at this pace, 30 minutes

4315
03:32:26.308 --> 03:32:29.490
until eventually the hobgoblin stops

4316
03:32:30.387 --> 03:32:34.230
and going to the side of this path glancing

4317
03:32:34.230 --> 03:32:39.230
past one of the trees goes, "There, up ahead."

4318
03:32:39.930 --> 03:32:42.190
You turn around the corner. You can see

4319
03:32:42.190 --> 03:32:43.750
there's a bit of a clearing that's been cleared

4320
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:46.237
in the center of the Vermaloc here.

4321
03:32:46.237 --> 03:32:48.070
The canopy gives away and sunlight

4322
03:32:48.070 --> 03:32:53.043
is coming down through the lush red top.

4323
03:32:54.040 --> 03:32:58.660
You see the outside of a fort.

4324
03:32:58.660 --> 03:33:02.369
You see tall purple wooden planks that are set

4325
03:33:02.369 --> 03:33:06.330
vertically, side to side roped together, sharpened

4326
03:33:06.330 --> 03:33:10.011
to a point near the top. You see a gate.

4327
03:33:10.011 --> 03:33:13.690
You see this long wall that encompasses and fills

4328
03:33:13.690 --> 03:33:16.630
the entirety of this clearing.

4329
03:33:16.630 --> 03:33:20.610
You see, from this perspective, one tower

4330
03:33:20.610 --> 03:33:22.040
that's prominently towards the front,

4331
03:33:22.040 --> 03:33:23.837
towards the left of the gate

4332
03:33:23.837 --> 03:33:25.012
and one that's a little further back.

4333
03:33:25.012 --> 03:33:26.880
Just the top of it peeking these watch towers

4334
03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:30.720
that are part of the exterior of

4335
03:33:30.720 --> 03:33:34.890
the entrance to the Steelworks, as he points out.

4336
03:33:35.770 --> 03:33:39.360
You can see it's a bit in disarray.

4337
03:33:39.360 --> 03:33:42.340
There's a couple of packs that are just strewn

4338
03:33:42.340 --> 03:33:43.895
and left around on the ground,

4339
03:33:43.895 --> 03:33:45.380
scattered on the outside of the gate near you.

4340
03:33:45.380 --> 03:33:48.490
You can see some rocks that are sitting on top

4341
03:33:48.490 --> 03:33:52.630
and there's sections at the very top

4342
03:33:52.630 --> 03:33:54.630
of the wall where the wood's broken a bit

4343
03:33:54.630 --> 03:33:58.102
and it suffered some damage from something.

4344
03:34:00.390 --> 03:34:05.390
Make a perception check Caduceus, Jester, and Caleb,

4345
03:34:06.185 --> 03:34:08.810
if you don't mind.
SAM: Come on, Laura Bailey.

4346
03:34:08.810 --> 03:34:09.643
TALIESIN: Ugh.

4347
03:34:10.880 --> 03:34:12.500
LAURA: Whoa. Oh, natural 20!

4348
03:34:12.500 --> 03:34:14.003
TALIESIN: Thank god.
ASHLEY: Yes.

4349
03:34:14.003 --> 03:34:16.190
TALIESIN: 11.
LIAM: Nine.

4350
03:34:16.190 --> 03:34:18.050
MATT: Okay.

4351
03:34:18.050 --> 03:34:20.241
While you guys are all glancing forward--

4352
03:34:20.241 --> 03:34:23.350
LAURA: This was a really shitty roll.

4353
03:34:23.350 --> 03:34:28.332
MATT: You notice you can see the

4354
03:34:30.611 --> 03:34:34.500
errant batches of logs and tools left outside.

4355
03:34:34.500 --> 03:34:38.760
You glance up over the perimeter way

4356
03:34:38.760 --> 03:34:41.310
the gate doesn't permit entry.

4357
03:34:41.310 --> 03:34:44.977
You see two heavy, gray stones

4358
03:34:44.977 --> 03:34:49.977
floating past the top of the fence,

4359
03:34:51.290 --> 03:34:55.180
gently bobbing and then one of them bobs out of view.

4360
03:34:55.180 --> 03:34:56.910
Then one lifts up over the edge

4361
03:34:56.910 --> 03:35:01.220
and you see a pair of eyes glance over.

4362
03:35:01.220 --> 03:35:04.173
You realize, at this point, this is one of these giants

4363
03:35:04.173 --> 03:35:08.910
looking over the perimeter, glancing around.

4364
03:35:08.910 --> 03:35:10.750
You're guessing at this distance, you don't know

4365
03:35:10.750 --> 03:35:13.920
quite know how tall the wall is,

4366
03:35:13.920 --> 03:35:18.638
but it looks like it stands and can look over the wall.

4367
03:35:28.480 --> 03:35:32.860
All of you hold your breath as Jester points this out.

4368
03:35:32.860 --> 03:35:35.943
The moorbounders (growling).

4369
03:35:38.180 --> 03:35:42.645
The giant scans the nearby tree line.

4370
03:35:45.530 --> 03:35:50.530
Scans past you guys again and fingers come off of the edge

4371
03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:57.000
and turns around (thudding) and dissipates behind.

4372
03:35:57.700 --> 03:35:59.770
From the vanishing point over the top of the wall,

4373
03:35:59.770 --> 03:36:02.920
you can no longer see them, but you see there are

4374
03:36:02.920 --> 03:36:06.230
apparently at least two at this immediate juncture

4375
03:36:06.230 --> 03:36:09.188
that are visible within the interior.

4376
03:36:09.188 --> 03:36:11.760
SAM: Now there's a gate, but it's not open or anything?

4377
03:36:11.760 --> 03:36:14.690
MATT: There's a double gate maybe about ten feet tall,

4378
03:36:14.690 --> 03:36:16.940
five feet wide, to each door side

4379
03:36:16.940 --> 03:36:19.913
that is currently closed to you.

4380
03:36:19.913 --> 03:36:21.060
TALIESIN: Ten feet tall, all right.

4381
03:36:21.060 --> 03:36:23.370
Six or seven--wow.

4382
03:36:23.370 --> 03:36:25.370
MATT: You see some heavy rocks or stones

4383
03:36:25.370 --> 03:36:29.170
that either the fort was built around or placed there

4384
03:36:29.170 --> 03:36:32.062
push up against some of the wall.

4385
03:36:33.180 --> 03:36:36.230
LAURA: They're really big.
TRAVIS: Two of them right?

4386
03:36:36.230 --> 03:36:38.510
SAM: We promised to kill them all

4387
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:41.927
and we told everyone we're giant killers.

4388
03:36:41.927 --> 03:36:43.921
What's our play here?

4389
03:36:43.921 --> 03:36:44.912
TALIESIN: I'm going to need a little more information

4390
03:36:44.912 --> 03:36:45.745
from our friend.

4391
03:36:45.745 --> 03:36:46.945
LIAM: Do we want to skirt the

4392
03:36:46.945 --> 03:36:48.136
entire perimeter of this place?

4393
03:36:48.136 --> 03:36:50.169
MARISHA: Remember Lorenzo's hideout?

4394
03:36:50.169 --> 03:36:51.077
SAM: Mm-hmm.

4395
03:36:51.077 --> 03:36:52.310
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4396
03:36:52.310 --> 03:36:55.285
MARISHA: It's that, but with giants.

4397
03:36:55.285 --> 03:36:58.293
LAURA: I don't--yeah.

4398
03:36:58.293 --> 03:37:02.580
MARISHA: One at a time, lure them out.

4399
03:37:02.580 --> 03:37:04.925
Try not to take them all at once.

4400
03:37:04.925 --> 03:37:07.530
TRAVIS: Maybe we should make one of them work for us.

4401
03:37:07.530 --> 03:37:08.943
SAM: Can we do that?

4402
03:37:08.943 --> 03:37:10.276
MARISHA: Can you do that?

4403
03:37:10.276 --> 03:37:12.720
TRAVIS: Maybe more than one.

4404
03:37:12.720 --> 03:37:15.890
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, think you can take those two?

4405
03:37:15.890 --> 03:37:19.560
Have them get us deeper inside?

4406
03:37:19.560 --> 03:37:22.180
If I had to guess, these two are patrol,

4407
03:37:22.180 --> 03:37:25.160
watching the borders and the boundaries

4408
03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:27.320
and there are more on the inside.

4409
03:37:27.320 --> 03:37:29.150
TALIESIN: Let's come into the tree line a little bit,

4410
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:33.020
a little bit closer just so we're not quite as close.

4411
03:37:33.020 --> 03:37:35.480
MARISHA: We also have to assume--why are they here?

4412
03:37:35.480 --> 03:37:39.473
Do they have a leader, is there like a king troll?

4413
03:37:39.473 --> 03:37:42.682
Giant, whatever?

4414
03:37:42.682 --> 03:37:45.477
Is it on the inside?

4415
03:37:46.800 --> 03:37:48.000
LIAM: I think that we should make an effort

4416
03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:49.870
to go around this entire place and see if

4417
03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:53.040
we can spot anymore and then I like your idea,

4418
03:37:53.040 --> 03:37:58.040
I could also turn one into a skunk if need be.

4419
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:59.700
LAURA: Oh hey, I could do that, too.

4420
03:37:59.700 --> 03:38:02.457
That's a really good idea, Caleb.

4421
03:38:02.457 --> 03:38:04.182
LIAM: They are probably not that bright.

4422
03:38:04.182 --> 03:38:06.180
TALIESIN: Real quick, friend, if you can do me a favor--

4423
03:38:06.180 --> 03:38:08.210
and I grab a stick off the ground--

4424
03:38:08.210 --> 03:38:12.100
you think it's possible to draw a little map

4425
03:38:12.100 --> 03:38:14.130
of what it's like in there?

4426
03:38:14.130 --> 03:38:17.100
MATT: As you can see, he's visibly shaken

4427
03:38:17.100 --> 03:38:19.000
by the proximity of the giants and is like--

4428
03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:20.160
TALIESIN: I'm going to back him away from

4429
03:38:20.160 --> 03:38:21.630
that end of the forest a bit.

4430
03:38:21.630 --> 03:38:23.220
MATT: His eyes are peering that direction.

4431
03:38:23.220 --> 03:38:26.815
His mouth is slightly agape.

4432
03:38:28.186 --> 03:38:30.145
He takes a stick and draws. You can see

4433
03:38:30.145 --> 03:38:33.030
on the nearest side to you, he points out,

4434
03:38:33.030 --> 03:38:37.110
is the Steelworks. The shape of the Steelworks

4435
03:38:37.110 --> 03:38:42.090
is like an open--like a hexagon that is carved--

4436
03:38:42.090 --> 03:38:44.610
the top of it is carved out of. He says,

4437
03:38:45.620 --> 03:38:50.620
"The Steelworks were built onto the mining encampment.

4438
03:38:51.770 --> 03:38:54.730
"It was affixed to it when the fighting began

4439
03:38:54.730 --> 03:38:57.910
"with the Empire. Originally it was just a mining camp,

4440
03:38:57.910 --> 03:39:00.650
"so it's tacked on."
TALIESIN: Gotcha.

4441
03:39:00.650 --> 03:39:02.230
MATT: Then he draws the actual mining camp,

4442
03:39:02.230 --> 03:39:07.230
which resembles a large trapezoid that evens off

4443
03:39:07.620 --> 03:39:12.490
and there's a perimeter fence around the mining encampment,

4444
03:39:12.490 --> 03:39:16.830
which is further west of here and then this Steelworks here

4445
03:39:16.830 --> 03:39:20.130
is a partial perimeter fence that meets two different

4446
03:39:20.130 --> 03:39:22.510
sides of the mining encampment.

4447
03:39:22.510 --> 03:39:24.010
TALIESIN: Is this is the only way in,

4448
03:39:24.010 --> 03:39:25.550
or is there any other way?

4449
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:30.550
MATT: "This gate is the front gate, but there are

4450
03:39:31.028 --> 03:39:33.670
"the rest of the wall is closed off.

4451
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:36.570
"There is one other gate on another side, but."

4452
03:39:36.570 --> 03:39:38.610
LAURA: I could make a gate for us anywhere we want.

4453
03:39:38.610 --> 03:39:40.070
TALIESIN: That's true.

4454
03:39:40.070 --> 03:39:42.370
If you could just magically step through the gate

4455
03:39:42.370 --> 03:39:46.059
anywhere is there anywhere that you would

4456
03:39:46.059 --> 03:39:51.059
recommend people appear if you wanted to be sneaky?

4457
03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:56.900
MATT: "There would be maybe--"
TALIESIN: On this thing

4458
03:39:56.900 --> 03:39:57.960
that you've drawn on the ground,

4459
03:39:57.960 --> 03:40:02.695
if we were going to sneak in and if the fence was no object?

4460
03:40:04.650 --> 03:40:06.560
MATT: "There is a

4461
03:40:09.630 --> 03:40:12.830
"there is a blacksmith installation

4462
03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:15.703
"a little ways south

4463
03:40:15.703 --> 03:40:18.260
"and further on the way down it has about a ten feet

4464
03:40:18.260 --> 03:40:20.730
"space between the wall and the actual building,

4465
03:40:20.730 --> 03:40:25.322
"that would maybe allow you a bit of a quiet entry."

4466
03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:27.755
TALIESIN: I'm excited by this plan.

4467
03:40:27.755 --> 03:40:30.536
MATT: "That is up to you. I am--"

4468
03:40:30.536 --> 03:40:32.043
TALIESIN: Could you just put

4469
03:40:32.043 --> 03:40:33.740
a little X on this crude thing.

4470
03:40:33.740 --> 03:40:37.160
MATT: "Yeah," marks it a bit.

4471
03:40:37.160 --> 03:40:39.120
LIAM: To this point here, this blacksmith

4472
03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:41.670
to that point there, where we're seeing these

4473
03:40:41.670 --> 03:40:44.870
two gentleman with their stones, how far

4474
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:48.389
apart are those two points, would you guess?

4475
03:40:48.389 --> 03:40:52.872
MATT: "A few hundred feet."
LIAM: A few hundred feet okay.

4476
03:40:52.872 --> 03:40:54.047
TALIESIN: I feel pretty confident

4477
03:40:54.047 --> 03:40:55.040
about everything we've gotten.

4478
03:40:55.040 --> 03:40:57.030
SAM: Do we do a circuit first and then go there?

4479
03:40:57.030 --> 03:41:01.400
Should we do a two-party circuit.

4480
03:41:01.400 --> 03:41:03.250
LAURA: Do it crazy, crazy stealthy, though

4481
03:41:03.250 --> 03:41:06.075
because those giants they can see over the wall.

4482
03:41:06.075 --> 03:41:08.390
TALIESIN: Do we do it on foot?
LIAM: Leave the moorbounders.

4483
03:41:08.390 --> 03:41:11.210
SAM: Leave them.

4484
03:41:11.210 --> 03:41:13.650
TALIESIN: If you wouldn't mind, well no, you can't take

4485
03:41:13.650 --> 03:41:15.300
care of the moorbounders.

4486
03:41:15.300 --> 03:41:16.420
Let's bring the moorbounders

4487
03:41:16.420 --> 03:41:19.490
a little further into the forest, maybe.

4488
03:41:19.490 --> 03:41:22.321
SAM: Oh yeah, away from--

4489
03:41:22.321 --> 03:41:25.910
TALIESIN: I think that you've done plenty.

4490
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:28.280
MATT: "I do too, I'm good, I'm done."

4491
03:41:28.280 --> 03:41:31.130
TALIESIN: Here is five for you, thank you.

4492
03:41:31.130 --> 03:41:32.330
We really appreciate it.

4493
03:41:32.330 --> 03:41:34.291
MATT: "Thank you," as soon as he gets the gold,

4494
03:41:34.291 --> 03:41:35.510
he turns around and quietly begins

4495
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:36.928
walking back where he came.

4496
03:41:36.928 --> 03:41:38.662
SAM: (crossbow loading)

4497
03:41:38.662 --> 03:41:41.179
(laughter)

4498
03:41:42.962 --> 03:41:45.851
TALIESIN: Only if it's a head shot.

4499
03:41:45.851 --> 03:41:48.673
SAM: All right, let's split up and go around.

4500
03:41:50.989 --> 03:41:52.742
TALIESIN: How do we want to split this?

4501
03:41:52.742 --> 03:41:54.070
TRAVIS: I'll go right.

4502
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:55.470
MARISHA: We'll go left.

4503
03:41:56.850 --> 03:41:59.120
SAM: We'll go right down the middle.

4504
03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:00.306
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: No wait.

4505
03:42:00.306 --> 03:42:02.744
LAURA: No, we'll go right.

4506
03:42:02.744 --> 03:42:04.849
ASHLEY: I'll go left.

4507
03:42:04.849 --> 03:42:05.770
LIAM: Oh boy.

4508
03:42:05.770 --> 03:42:07.040
TALIESIN: Are you going right or left?

4509
03:42:07.040 --> 03:42:09.020
LAURA: Maybe I should go right, you go left

4510
03:42:09.020 --> 03:42:10.600
so that we split the clerics.

4511
03:42:10.600 --> 03:42:12.100
TALIESIN: As long as we split the clerics,

4512
03:42:12.100 --> 03:42:15.471
we should be fine.

4513
03:42:15.471 --> 03:42:16.304
SAM: All right.

4514
03:42:16.304 --> 03:42:18.237
MATT: All right, so who's going left?

4515
03:42:20.570 --> 03:42:22.960
Okay, and then you three going right?

4516
03:42:22.960 --> 03:42:26.110
Okay, stealth rolls for your beasts please.

4517
03:42:26.110 --> 03:42:28.177
Oh, you're going on foot.

4518
03:42:28.177 --> 03:42:31.442
Right, so stealth rolls for the troop.

4519
03:42:31.442 --> 03:42:32.492
LIAM: Super cocked.

4520
03:42:32.492 --> 03:42:35.027
The most cocked of any I have ever rolled.

4521
03:42:35.027 --> 03:42:36.530
MARISHA: Finally, a good roll.

4522
03:42:36.530 --> 03:42:38.640
TRAVIS: 13.

4523
03:42:38.640 --> 03:42:40.300
MARISHA: 27.

4524
03:42:40.300 --> 03:42:41.700
LIAM: 12.

4525
03:42:41.700 --> 03:42:43.200
SAM: 32.

4526
03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:44.347
LAURA: 17.

4527
03:42:44.347 --> 03:42:47.422
TALIESIN: Oh no, five.

4528
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:52.071
TRAVIS: Come on, Ashley, stealth check, come on.

4529
03:42:52.071 --> 03:42:53.162
MARISHA: Classic.

4530
03:42:53.162 --> 03:42:55.237
SAM: It's your specialty.
ASHLEY: I rolled a one.

4531
03:42:55.237 --> 03:42:59.122
MARISHA: (cheering)
TRAVIS: Oh, she's back!

4532
03:43:00.967 --> 03:43:05.493
MATT: Okay. You guys begin to disperse.

4533
03:43:07.430 --> 03:43:09.863
As you guys are quietly stepping forward,

4534
03:43:09.863 --> 03:43:11.704
what you didn't notice, Yasha,

4535
03:43:11.704 --> 03:43:14.520
was eating in the hollow by one of these trees

4536
03:43:14.520 --> 03:43:19.370
as you're stepping by appears to be a small, gangly,

4537
03:43:19.370 --> 03:43:24.370
possibly diseased beaver or wolverine-type creature.

4538
03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:29.351
You just step on its tail and it (screams)

4539
03:43:29.351 --> 03:43:31.393
and it attacks your ankle and you kick it off

4540
03:43:31.393 --> 03:43:34.446
off to that side. You look back at the rest of the group,

4541
03:43:34.446 --> 03:43:38.533
you just hear (pounding).

4542
03:43:38.533 --> 03:43:41.160
MARISHA: Hide! Get down!

4543
03:43:41.160 --> 03:43:43.713
SAM: Just their half of the party, right?

4544
03:43:43.713 --> 03:43:47.220
MATT: This is like a minute after you guys split,

4545
03:43:47.220 --> 03:43:50.740
so you're a little ways away, but not that far.

4546
03:43:50.740 --> 03:43:53.870
Yeah, you guys heard this.

4547
03:43:53.870 --> 03:43:55.370
MARISHA: Is there anything that we can all

4548
03:43:55.370 --> 03:43:58.026
duck and cover nearby, like nearby tree line?

4549
03:43:58.026 --> 03:43:59.418
MATT: Yeah, you all think you've ducked and covered.

4550
03:43:59.418 --> 03:44:01.426
LIAM: Right, the stealth rolls already happened.

4551
03:44:01.426 --> 03:44:03.184
LIAM: The stealth rolls already happened.

4552
03:44:03.184 --> 03:44:05.883
MATT: You all hide and you watch as

4553
03:44:05.883 --> 03:44:09.640
two of them look over.

4554
03:44:09.640 --> 03:44:12.440
SAM: Oh boy, oh boy.

4555
03:44:15.370 --> 03:44:19.461
MATT: One of them (grumbles)

4556
03:44:19.461 --> 03:44:22.230
turns around and walks back.

4557
03:44:22.230 --> 03:44:24.705
The other one goes--

4558
03:44:27.134 --> 03:44:29.759
MATT: The head ducks down.

4559
03:44:29.759 --> 03:44:32.080
LAURA: How far away, how far away?

4560
03:44:32.080 --> 03:44:35.050
MATT: From where you are right now, I'd say

4561
03:44:35.050 --> 03:44:37.030
you're eyeballing about 60 feet.

4562
03:44:37.030 --> 03:44:38.380
TALIESIN: I'm getting ready to run

4563
03:44:38.380 --> 03:44:40.550
because I know what's coming.

4564
03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:42.250
TRAVIS: They're both about 60 feet away?

4565
03:44:42.250 --> 03:44:46.380
MATT: No, the other one is further back.

4566
03:44:46.380 --> 03:44:48.213
TALIESIN: I'm waiting for it.

4567
03:44:48.213 --> 03:44:52.229
MATT: It chucks a large stone

4568
03:44:52.229 --> 03:44:55.660
that's heading right for Yasha.

4569
03:44:55.660 --> 03:44:58.598
SAM: Welcome back, Ashley Johnson.

4570
03:45:01.543 --> 03:45:03.517
MATT: That is going to be a 24 to hit.

4571
03:45:04.570 --> 03:45:06.340
ASHLEY: Oh yeah that definitely hits.

4572
03:45:06.340 --> 03:45:11.340
MATT: Okay. As this large stone hits the ground before you,

4573
03:45:11.940 --> 03:45:14.240
dirt sprays in your direction. As you try to pull back,

4574
03:45:14.240 --> 03:45:18.030
it rolls and slams into you, sending you ten feet back.

4575
03:45:18.030 --> 03:45:21.230
Your head is ringing from the impact.

4576
03:45:21.230 --> 03:45:24.073
This is going to be

4577
03:45:28.430 --> 03:45:31.006
25 points of bludgeoning damage

4578
03:45:31.006 --> 03:45:33.592
and then you have to make a strength saving throw to me.

4579
03:45:33.592 --> 03:45:35.020
ASHLEY: Okay, do I have resistance to bludgeoning?

4580
03:45:35.020 --> 03:45:35.853
I'm just--

4581
03:45:35.853 --> 03:45:37.528
MATT: You're not raging, so you don't.

4582
03:45:37.528 --> 03:45:38.361
ASHLEY: That's right, okay.

4583
03:45:38.361 --> 03:45:39.811
What did you just say to do? I'm sorry.

4584
03:45:39.811 --> 03:45:41.120
MATT: Make a strength saving throw for me, please.

4585
03:45:41.120 --> 03:45:44.175
ASHLEY: Make a strength saving throw.

4586
03:45:44.175 --> 03:45:45.008
TALIESIN: Oh yay.

4587
03:45:46.880 --> 03:45:49.860
That's cocked.

4588
03:45:49.860 --> 03:45:51.443
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

4589
03:45:52.791 --> 03:45:54.250
MATT: It hits you and as opposed to falling onto your back,

4590
03:45:54.250 --> 03:45:57.716
you dig in your heels, grinding back about three feet.

4591
03:45:57.716 --> 03:46:02.470
You manage to to stop the rolling of the boulder in place

4592
03:46:02.470 --> 03:46:06.540
and it comes to rest. That hurt, and you can feel

4593
03:46:06.540 --> 03:46:08.320
the blood rushing from your nose, it might be broken.

4594
03:46:08.320 --> 03:46:10.825
As you look up over the edge, you can see

4595
03:46:10.825 --> 03:46:15.825
the giant looking right at you and its fingers

4596
03:46:16.341 --> 03:46:21.341
curl back and it backs into the fort.

4597
03:46:22.090 --> 03:46:24.640
It knows you're here.

4598
03:46:26.555 --> 03:46:27.699
That's where we're going finish tonight.

4599
03:46:27.699 --> 03:46:30.620
(groaning)

4600
03:46:30.620 --> 03:46:32.920

SAM: Jesus.

4602
03:46:34.210 --> 03:46:36.810
ASHLEY: So much for stealth mode.

4603
03:46:36.810 --> 03:46:40.185
MATT: Sometimes you can get around it, sometimes you can't.

4604
03:46:40.185 --> 03:46:44.439
LIAM: ♪ There are big tall terrible giants in the mine ♪

4605
03:46:44.439 --> 03:46:46.155

4606
03:46:46.155 --> 03:46:48.154
TRAVIS: Welcome back, Ash-o-lee!

4607
03:46:48.154 --> 03:46:50.691

4608
03:46:50.691 --> 03:46:51.741
ASHLEY: Yay!

4609
03:46:51.741 --> 03:46:53.232
MATT: Oh man. We're jumping back into it next week.

4610
03:46:53.232 --> 03:46:54.670
LAURA: Oh man.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

4611
03:46:55.760 --> 03:46:58.570
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

4612
03:46:58.570 --> 03:47:03.090
MATT: Ah man. Well, yeah, wow. We're going to jump into this

We know nothing.
SAM: We're doing a brunch

4617
03:47:14.230 --> 03:47:17.070
next week or no?

4618
03:47:17.070 --> 03:47:19.550
LAURA: I mean, should we?

4619
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:20.730
MATT: We can, but whatever we're wearing

4620
03:47:20.730 --> 03:47:22.570
we have to wear for the after party.

4621
03:47:22.570 --> 03:47:24.730
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

4622
03:47:24.730 --> 03:47:26.230
MARISHA: Oh right.
LIAM: That'd be interesting.

4623
03:47:26.230 --> 03:47:27.620
SAM: Sure.

4624
03:47:27.620 --> 03:47:30.000
MATT: Travis is not.
LAURA: Maybe we shouldn't

4625
03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:31.990
have mimosas before the after party.

4626
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:33.310
Let's save the brunch for another day.

4627

4628

TALIESIN: We'll do it for like something another

4629
03:47:36.560 --> 03:47:38.990

MATT: Sounds good.

4631
03:47:39.823 --> 03:47:42.039
Well, thank you, guys. Ashley, welcome back.

4632

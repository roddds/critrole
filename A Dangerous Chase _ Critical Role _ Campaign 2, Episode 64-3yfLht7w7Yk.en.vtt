00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.941
MATT: Hello, everyone,

2
00:00:00.941 --> 00:00:02.731
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:03.931
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:05.880
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.871
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:08.923
MATT: You were--

7
00:00:08.923 --> 00:00:10.897
MARISHA: Just let you go.
TALIESIN: I don't understand what's happening

8
00:00:10.897 --> 00:00:12.022
TRAVIS: Wow, was I all by myself?

9
00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:13.531
MATT: Yeah, you got abandoned on that one.

10
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:16.804
LAURA: I was distracted by Marisha's call out.

11
00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:19.037
LIAM: Jump into the water at the same time! One, two, three!

12
00:00:19.037 --> 00:00:20.296
Meh.

13
00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:21.687
MATT: Nope.

14
00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.055
So anyway.

15
00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.357
Welcome.

16
00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.317
Uh. (laughs)

17
00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:27.535
Before we get into tonight's game,

18
00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:30.007
we have a few announcements.

19
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:31.255
Starting with our fantastic sponsor,

20
00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:32.935
we have two sponsors tonight.

21
00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:35.606
First one is our returning friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

22
00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:37.023
LAURA: D&amp;D Beyond!

23
00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.946
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond. Guys,

24
00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:42.826
so many amazing Critters support us

25
00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:44.367
and support Red Nose Day

26
00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:45.796
and support D&amp;D Beyond

27
00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:48.436
by subscribing. Not just Critters here in America,

28
00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:49.535
but all over the world,

29
00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:51.875
especially, I want to give a shout out tonight

30
00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.586
to our friends and Critters in Australia.

31
00:00:54.586 --> 00:00:58.992
And because we are such fine voice actors

32
00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.425
with talented accent skills--

33
00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:02.258
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

34
00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:03.635
SAM: I'm going to give a shout out

35
00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:07.295
to the Australian Critters in their native tongue.

36
00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:08.386
(throat clearing)

37
00:01:08.386 --> 00:01:10.492
Crikey, crikey, okay.

38
00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:11.893
LAURA: No, no.

39
00:01:11.893 --> 00:01:13.581
SAM: (exaggerated Australian accent) G'day down under!

40
00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.162
All you Bruces and Sheilas in the Outback

41
00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:18.855
should know about D&amp;D Beyond!

42
00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:21.775
It does all the hard yakka of gaming for you

43
00:01:21.775 --> 00:01:25.325
so you can relax and skull a stub of your beer,

44
00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:30.242
a tinny of cab sav, or even a slab of frothy for your mates.

45
00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:31.683
(laughing and jeering)

46
00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:33.024
SAM: (normal voice) Ooh, that was rough.

47
00:01:33.024 --> 00:01:36.610
(accent) Bloody oath! (laughs)

48
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.255
The D&amp;D Beyond app is so easy

49
00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:42.735
even a drongo bludger could use it.

50
00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.033
In fact! (laughs)

51
00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.674
TRAVIS: What are you touching? Are you touching your ear?

52
00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:47.463
SAM: If you-- I don't know what this...

53
00:01:47.463 --> 00:01:51.640
(stuttering) If you don't use D&amp;D Beyond,

54
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.015
well, you've got a few kangaroos loose

55
00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:56.032
in your top paddock!

56
00:01:57.263 --> 00:01:58.096
Billabong!

57
00:01:58.096 --> 00:01:59.703
TALIESIN: Nope!

58
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:02.261
SAM: So put on your sunnies, your thongs,

59
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:04.284
your flannies, your knickers,

60
00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:07.135
your trekkie decks, light up a ciggie,

61
00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:11.183
fire up that lappie, and head on over to dndbeyond.com

62
00:02:11.183 --> 00:02:16.183
to pick up the newest D&amp;D adventure! (laughs)

63
00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:18.863
LIAM: I hear accents get better if you do them louder.

64
00:02:18.863 --> 00:02:20.695
(laughter)

65
00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:21.528
SAM: But!

66
00:02:22.383 --> 00:02:25.661
The newest D&amp;D adventure, Ghosts--

67
00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:27.911
(laughter)

68
00:02:29.118 --> 00:02:29.951
TRAVIS: Oh god!

69
00:02:31.262 --> 00:02:32.095
SAM: Gho--

70
00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:37.095
(laughter)

71
00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:38.714
SAM: Adventure!

72
00:02:38.714 --> 00:02:40.965
Ghosts of Saltmarsh!

73
00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:42.335
(cheering)

74
00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:45.885
SAM: Ghosts of Saltmarsh, which is, crikey,

75
00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:49.682
available today at D&amp;D Beyond.

76
00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:53.712
The swashbuckling spooky adventure is finally here!

77
00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:54.545
LIAM: Make it stop.

78
00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:56.085
SAM: Piece of piss!

79
00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:58.970
(normal voice) Which I'm told is a good phrase. (laughs)

80
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.277
(accent) Well, I reckon that news is sweeter

81
00:03:01.277 --> 00:03:04.106
than Tim Tams covered in Vegemite!

82
00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:05.774
(groaning)

83
00:03:05.774 --> 00:03:07.066
SAM: Ripper!

84
00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:08.607
(laughter)

85
00:03:08.607 --> 00:03:11.255
SAM: Suss it out right now at dndbeyond.com

86
00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:14.375
and you'll be apples, beauty, that's not a knife!

87
00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:15.327
(normal voice) Back to you, Matt.

88
00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:17.117
(laughs, jeering)

89
00:03:17.117 --> 00:03:18.506
ASHLEY: Did you also do the VO

90
00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:20.034
for the Outback Steakhouse?

91
00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:21.285
(laughter)

92
00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:24.594
TALIESIN: Does Australia-- how big is their standing army?

93
00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:26.554
MARISHA: There's an actual Australian in the building.

94
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:27.593
That's all it takes.

95
00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:28.546
SAM: We do?

96
00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:30.085
That's right!

97
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.642
Oh no, he's out there!

98
00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:35.653
He's out there watching this right now!

99
00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:37.312
I'm going to get shivved

100
00:03:37.312 --> 00:03:39.373
or whatever they call it in Australia!

101
00:03:39.373 --> 00:03:42.674
TALIESIN: Murder. They call it murder.

102
00:03:42.674 --> 00:03:44.064
SAM: I'm going to get Billabonged!

103
00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:46.543
MATT: All right, we're done.

104
00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:48.310
Thank you, Sam?

105
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.068
TALIESIN: -- plot device, man. That's the only difference.

106
00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:52.735
LIAM: That put me on edge.

107
00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:56.103
MATT: Oh.

108
00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:59.332
TALIESIN: I was fine. Now I'm nervous about the game.

109
00:03:59.332 --> 00:04:00.362
MATT: I don't know about you guys,

110
00:04:00.362 --> 00:04:02.221
all I can hear is white noise right now.

111
00:04:03.504 --> 00:04:04.712
Thank you, Sam, and thank you, D&amp;D Beyond

112
00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:06.952
for your endless patience with Sam Riegel.

113
00:04:06.952 --> 00:04:09.681
(laughter)

114
00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:11.853
MATT: Our secondary sponsor for tonight,

115
00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:14.664
our friends at Rook &amp; The Raven.

116
00:04:14.664 --> 00:04:16.893
Returning once again, we've talked about them before.

117
00:04:16.893 --> 00:04:18.531
We're happy to bring them forth again

118
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:19.631
to discuss their fantastic line

119
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:21.744
of campaign books. They did these amazing

120
00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:23.162
hand-crafted disc bound books,

121
00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:23.995
in which you can keep tabs

122
00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:25.032
of all your character information,

123
00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:25.951
your campaign information.

124
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:27.261
Marisha, you have one over there right now

125
00:04:27.261 --> 00:04:29.133
that you have been using for quite some time.

126
00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:30.522
MARISHA: I keep adding paper to it,

127
00:04:30.522 --> 00:04:33.221
and it keeps getting bigger and bigger.

128
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:36.322
It's pretty. It's really good.

129
00:04:36.322 --> 00:04:37.642
It's hardy, yeah.

130
00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:39.232
MATT: You can easily add and remove pages.

131
00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:40.482
It's great for any tabletop game,

132
00:04:40.482 --> 00:04:42.202
for keeping track of your character or your campaigns

133
00:04:42.202 --> 00:04:45.313
and they have special editions for each.

134
00:04:45.313 --> 00:04:46.416
You can check out all their amazing stuff

135
00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:50.583
at therookandtheraven.com/criticalrole.

136
00:04:51.744 --> 00:04:52.577
For a limited time,

137
00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:53.936
you can use the code CRITROLE

138
00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:57.037
on their website to get ten dollars off your order.

139
00:04:57.037 --> 00:04:57.936
So.

140
00:04:57.936 --> 00:04:59.269
Go check it out.

141
00:05:01.424 --> 00:05:02.292
You all right, you still got--

142
00:05:02.292 --> 00:05:03.125
TALIESIN: Yeah just, you know, you just hit me.

143
00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:03.958
I just bled a little bit.

144
00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.194
I just took another d4 of damage.

145
00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:07.248
MATT: Okay, there you go.

146
00:05:07.248 --> 00:05:09.450
A couple other quick announcements, too.

147
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.936
If you guys haven't seen it yet,

148
00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:12.896
we showed it before the stream tonight,

149
00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.768
but it's on YouTube as well.

150
00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:17.917
We ran a very special one-shot of me running

151
00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:20.351
a one-on-one game with Stephen Colbert

152
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:22.447
as part of Red Nose Day.

153
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.475
It was insane.

154
00:05:23.475 --> 00:05:25.316
TRAVIS: You said that sentence. That was a real sentence.

155
00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:26.831
MATT: I know, I know, it's--

156
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.357
It didn't hit me until yesterday.

157
00:05:28.357 --> 00:05:30.334
LAURA: Hello, bees!

158
00:05:30.334 --> 00:05:32.184
MATT: Hello, bees!

159
00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:33.565
You guys, thank you so much

160
00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:36.837
for all of your fantastic support.

161
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.597
The people at Red Nose Day do incredible work

162
00:05:38.597 --> 00:05:40.477
to work towards ending child poverty

163
00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:41.386
and you guys have already raised

164
00:05:41.386 --> 00:05:43.586
an extremely generous amount

165
00:05:43.586 --> 00:05:46.845
for this. You are still available--

166
00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:48.815
you are still able to make donations right now

167
00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:52.455
and it's still available at critrole.com/rednoseday

168
00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:53.455
and if you haven't had a chance to see the video

169
00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:54.706
it is up on our YouTube

170
00:05:54.706 --> 00:05:55.539
at the Crit Role channel.

171
00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.233
ASHLEY: It's so good.
TALIESIN: It's so romantic.

172
00:05:57.233 --> 00:05:58.175
MATT: I thought I was--

173
00:05:58.175 --> 00:06:01.121
I thought I was in love with Stephen Colbert before,

174
00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:03.167
and I think we're steady now.

175
00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:04.356
(laughter)

176
00:06:04.356 --> 00:06:06.125
MATT: I was pretty happy about that.

177
00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:08.505
ASHLEY: I thought he was in love with Matt Mercer before.

178
00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:09.338
Until I saw--

179
00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:10.745
TALIESIN: No, I don't, yeah.

180
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:11.578
I don't know what--

181
00:06:11.578 --> 00:06:13.286
MATT: Fuck that guy.

182
00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:16.388
Thank you so much for supporting that, guys.

183
00:06:16.388 --> 00:06:18.986
Next Friday, May 31, 7:00pm Pacific,

184
00:06:18.986 --> 00:06:23.628
we'll be airing a very special My Little Pony one-shot.

185
00:06:23.628 --> 00:06:25.365
Led by our buddy Mark Hulmes,

186
00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:26.847
Mark, if you want to come say hi real fast.

187
00:06:26.847 --> 00:06:29.236
(cheering)

188
00:06:29.236 --> 00:06:30.124
MATT: What's up, bud?

189
00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:31.497
MARK: Hey!

190
00:06:31.497 --> 00:06:33.256
MATT: He's been storming our studio this week.

191
00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:34.468
MARK: Yeah, been hanging out,

192
00:06:34.468 --> 00:06:35.656
just chilling out.

193
00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:36.596
Doing stuff.

194
00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.777
PRODUCER: Go lower, Mark.

195
00:06:37.777 --> 00:06:39.457
MARK: Go lower? There we go.

196
00:06:39.457 --> 00:06:41.416
There we go, nice.

197
00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:42.249
Hey.

198
00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.256
Hey, everybody.

199
00:06:44.256 --> 00:06:46.996
Yeah, so we did a My Little Pony one-shot,

200
00:06:46.996 --> 00:06:48.217
which I think there's a little promo for

201
00:06:48.217 --> 00:06:50.960
in the break, I think, we filmed.

202
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.793
So you get to see the cast,

203
00:06:51.793 --> 00:06:53.025
the cool artwork.

204
00:06:53.025 --> 00:06:54.445
It was a lot of fun.

205
00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:56.167
Liam and Ashley definitely kept me on my toes

206
00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:58.196
along with some of the other players that you'll see.

207
00:06:58.196 --> 00:06:59.029
MATT: Apparently.

208
00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.474
MARK: Yeah, and it was really fun.

209
00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:01.307
MATT: Heck yeah.

210
00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:02.767
Look for that next Friday, May 31st

211
00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:05.469
at 7:00pm in place of, well not in place of anything,

212
00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:08.769
it's a Friday, so thank you, Mark.

213
00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:10.159
TRAVIS: Good bye, Mark!

214
00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:11.057
Those who aren't familiar with Mark,

215
00:07:11.057 --> 00:07:12.617
he played Calianna in this last campaign before,

216
00:07:12.617 --> 00:07:13.697
so you should be familiar.

217
00:07:13.697 --> 00:07:15.887
Also, he has an amazing show called High Rollers.

218
00:07:15.887 --> 00:07:17.639
He runs the Yogscast Network.

219
00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.047
Check them out as well.

220
00:07:20.047 --> 00:07:21.017
Yeah, so as part of that

221
00:07:21.017 --> 00:07:22.207
we have our Ashley Johnson,

222
00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:25.428
Liam O'Brien, as well as pals Markeia McCarty,

223
00:07:25.428 --> 00:07:28.348
who is amazing, Julie Nathanson, who's amazing,

224
00:07:28.348 --> 00:07:33.348
you saw her on the Nightmare Before Critmas one-shot,

225
00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:37.007
and Roger Craig Smith, voice of many things

226
00:07:37.007 --> 00:07:39.574
including Sonic the Hedgehog, not the movie.

227
00:07:41.065 --> 00:07:44.325
Instead that's another friend of the show, Ben Schwartz.

228
00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:45.604
Yes, VOD will be available

229
00:07:45.604 --> 00:07:47.873

230
00:07:47.873 --> 00:07:48.706
so if you miss it that Friday,

231
00:07:48.706 --> 00:07:50.073
you can see it that Sunday.

232
00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:51.156
Check it out.

233
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.363
I guess, Laura, you have a merch thing?

234
00:07:55.363 --> 00:07:57.609
LAURA: Oh, funny you should say!

235
00:07:57.609 --> 00:07:58.485
Why yes.

236
00:07:58.485 --> 00:07:59.843
LIAM: (like Gollum) What is it?

237
00:07:59.843 --> 00:08:01.962
LAURA: Shut up, like you don't know, Liam.

238

00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:17.064
but it will, you know.

The usge.

245
00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:18.981
MATT: It'll make its way there.

246
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:20.899
LAURA: It's really cool! You should see it up close,

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:22.691

249
00:08:23.824 --> 00:08:24.657
TRAVIS: Details!

250
00:08:24.657 --> 00:08:26.023
LAURA: It's our pattern, it's a pattern.

251
00:08:26.023 --> 00:08:26.856
SAM: A mandala?

252
00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:27.989
LAURA: Yeah, it's a pattern that represents

Check it out at our shop.

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:39.268

(laughter)

258
00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:42.589
SAM: Just say it in Australian.

259
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:43.612
TRAVIS: Crit Role--

00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:48.658
SAM: Oh, that's a thing now.

262
00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:50.491
(laughter)

263
00:08:50.491 --> 00:08:51.324
LAURA: Anyway.

264
00:08:51.324 --> 00:08:53.619
It's super cool, you should check it out.

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:56.069
There's other stuff in our store as well.

266
00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:57.389
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

267
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:59.549
(laughter)

268
00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:01.139
MATT: And with that.

269
00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:01.972
Oh?

270
00:09:01.972 --> 00:09:02.805
LAURA: I'm sorry, no, I'm sorry,

271
00:09:02.805 --> 00:09:03.788
I got really excited talking to Sam.

272
00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:05.959
I've got cool dice that I'm excited about today.

273
00:09:05.959 --> 00:09:07.439
MATT: Show them off!

274
00:09:07.439 --> 00:09:09.008
LAURA: These were given to me a long time ago,

275
00:09:09.008 --> 00:09:11.506
but I just am now bringing them into the game, these--

276
00:09:11.506 --> 00:09:12.989
TRAVIS: They're all black?
SAM: You have to hold them up.

277
00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:13.868
LAURA: Okay, okay.

278
00:09:13.868 --> 00:09:15.741
They're in the shape of your different,

279
00:09:15.741 --> 00:09:17.349
your different kind of characters

280
00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:19.008
so depending on what you're damage is,

281
00:09:19.008 --> 00:09:20.357
it's like, oh this is a sword,

282
00:09:20.357 --> 00:09:22.389
and it rolls a d6.

283
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:23.269
SAM: This is a mace or whatever.

284
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:24.317
LAURA: This is a, yeah.

285
00:09:24.317 --> 00:09:25.739
There's a potion bottle.

286
00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:26.572
TRAVIS: What?

287
00:09:26.572 --> 00:09:28.855
LAURA: There's a fist and these are both fists.

288
00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:30.597
These would be good for you, Marisha.

289
00:09:30.597 --> 00:09:31.930
SAM: They're really cool.
MARISHA: Pop, pop!

290
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.259
LAURA: Anyway, it's cool.

291
00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:34.709
I'm excited to use them tonight.

292
00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:36.059
You go like that,

293
00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:38.438
and then it's a four that it landed on.

294
00:09:38.438 --> 00:09:39.651
SAM: You much more successfully

295
00:09:39.651 --> 00:09:41.297
plugged your dice than our shirt.

296
00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:43.547
(laughter)

297
00:09:44.869 --> 00:09:46.875
LAURA: Check out this awesome shirt!

298
00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:48.219
SAM: That's genuine love.

299
00:09:48.219 --> 00:09:50.131
LAURA: I've been really excited about this shirt

300
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.866
for a long time, so this isn't the first time I'm seeing it,

301
00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:55.539
but it's the first time you're seeing it!

302
00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:57.532
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

303
00:09:57.532 --> 00:09:58.829
LAURA: Thanks, Laura.

304
00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:00.119
MATT: All right.

305
00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:01.136
LIAM: Quick sidebar.

306
00:10:01.136 --> 00:10:02.058
LIAM: Yes, sidebar?

307
00:10:02.058 --> 00:10:05.268
LIAM: Laura and Taliesin are dressed like bees.

308
00:10:05.268 --> 00:10:07.858
And Marisha is wearing a bee.

309
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:09.498
LAURA: How did we do that?

310
00:10:09.498 --> 00:10:11.418
MARISHA: Just in honor of Eric.

311
00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:12.251
MATT: Yes.

312
00:10:12.251 --> 00:10:14.258
Already, Eric the Bee.

313
00:10:14.258 --> 00:10:15.091
Eric the Bee.

314
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:16.758
MARISHA: Happy Red Nose Day, everybody.

315
00:10:16.758 --> 00:10:17.591
LAURA: We're Hufflepuffs, y'all.

316
00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:18.616
MATT: Damn right!

317
00:10:18.616 --> 00:10:19.449
Represent.

318
00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:21.481
Anyway.

319
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.519
Enough of this dilly dallying.

320
00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:26.447
Or shilly shellying. (laughs)

321
00:10:26.447 --> 00:10:28.388
LIAM: --drop down into the moment

322
00:10:28.388 --> 00:10:30.538
that we left off in last time?

323
00:10:30.538 --> 00:10:31.371
Do we?

324
00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:32.590

(dragon roaring)

369
00:12:14.149 --> 00:12:15.459
MATT: And welcome back.

370
00:12:15.459 --> 00:12:16.520
SAM: Getting in on it!

371
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.171
MATT: Yeah!

372
00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:19.181
Nice try.

373
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:20.043
TALIESIN: Respect.

374
00:12:20.043 --> 00:12:20.876
MATT: So.

375
00:12:21.803 --> 00:12:23.220
Last we left off.

376
00:12:24.392 --> 00:12:26.251
The Mighty Nein, who have been residing

377
00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:28.411
for a little bit of time

378
00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:33.411
in the region of Xhorhas, the eastern Wynandir area

379
00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:36.421
on Wildemount, you've made alliances

380
00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:39.493
in the city of Rosohna

381
00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:42.381
with the Bright Queen and the Kryn Dynasty.

382
00:12:42.381 --> 00:12:44.763
You returned a beacon.

383
00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:47.493
You've done a few deeds

384
00:12:47.493 --> 00:12:50.531
and gave unto the Bright Queen

385
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:53.283
information about movement the Empire was taking

386
00:12:53.283 --> 00:12:56.288
in this war that they have with the Dynasty.

387
00:12:56.288 --> 00:12:58.685
You were rewarded as such.

388
00:12:58.685 --> 00:13:01.843
And begin to pursue a thread of information

389
00:13:01.843 --> 00:13:04.021
that you worried might have something to do

390
00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:06.121
with this war,

391
00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:09.835
whatever it may be.

392
00:13:09.835 --> 00:13:11.542
You've scryed upon the individual

393
00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:13.323
and learned of a dropping point

394
00:13:13.323 --> 00:13:14.156
or some sort of a meeting

395
00:13:14.156 --> 00:13:15.693
that was to happen in the city.

396
00:13:15.693 --> 00:13:17.662
Upon the date of this fateful meeting,

397
00:13:17.662 --> 00:13:20.115
you found a place to watch

398
00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:21.448
and lie in wait.

399
00:13:22.493 --> 00:13:24.842
You watched a number of individuals enter

400
00:13:24.842 --> 00:13:27.092
the Overcrow Apothecary and

401
00:13:28.104 --> 00:13:30.322
Nott went on a stealth mission,

402
00:13:30.322 --> 00:13:32.083
managed to avoid detection

403
00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:34.251
a number of times.

404
00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:36.424
Except for the last one.

405
00:13:36.424 --> 00:13:39.271
Upon doing so, a brief conflict took place

406
00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:41.352
within the apothecary, in which

407
00:13:41.352 --> 00:13:43.123
the drow figure that was meeting

408
00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:47.506
with this dragonborn character on horseback

409
00:13:48.643 --> 00:13:50.112
managed to flee.

410
00:13:50.112 --> 00:13:53.192
The bodyguard left behind to fight to the death.

411
00:13:53.192 --> 00:13:56.752
The courier it seems,

412
00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:58.915
this dragonborn, killed in the street

413
00:13:58.915 --> 00:14:00.604
along with its horse.

414
00:14:00.604 --> 00:14:03.355
You managed to diffuse the immediate tension

415
00:14:03.355 --> 00:14:04.755
of the nearby guard and populace

416
00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:06.652
being interested in this sudden display

417
00:14:06.652 --> 00:14:09.323
of bloodshed and conflict.

418
00:14:09.323 --> 00:14:11.613
You managed to temporarily hold off

419
00:14:11.613 --> 00:14:14.811
and keep, not a prisoner,

420
00:14:14.811 --> 00:14:16.944
but certainly under your watch,

421
00:14:16.944 --> 00:14:20.475
the owner of the Overcrow, Maruo the goblin,

422
00:14:20.475 --> 00:14:23.958
as well as her bugbear bodyguard.

423
00:14:25.224 --> 00:14:26.653
You've dragged the corpse

424
00:14:26.653 --> 00:14:28.093
of both the dragonborn and the horse

425
00:14:28.093 --> 00:14:30.003
to the back of the building,

426
00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:32.312
and you've gained just enough knowledge

427
00:14:32.312 --> 00:14:34.013
through your spell use

428
00:14:34.013 --> 00:14:35.942
that the figure that escaped,

429
00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:39.282
this drow figure has been on the move northward

430
00:14:39.282 --> 00:14:41.161
and beyond the reach of the spells

431
00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:42.911
you had already cast.

432
00:14:43.864 --> 00:14:44.697
So.

433
00:14:45.683 --> 00:14:48.413
We come back to you all gathering

434
00:14:48.413 --> 00:14:49.746
at the Overcrow

435
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:53.603
and figuring out what to do next.

436
00:14:53.603 --> 00:14:55.293
So Mighty Nein,

437
00:14:55.293 --> 00:14:56.773
what would you like to do?

438
00:14:56.773 --> 00:15:00.002
LAURA: We should be pulling those bodies through the window.

439
00:15:00.002 --> 00:15:01.763
MARISHA: The body of a horse?

440
00:15:01.763 --> 00:15:05.471
LAURA: And the body of the dragonborn.

441
00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.131
TRAVIS: I think the horse can stay.

442
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:08.521
We can put it in storage.

443
00:15:08.521 --> 00:15:10.649
LAURA: We'll just cover it up in blankets or something.

444
00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:11.931
TALIESIN: Let's put it in the back room.

445
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:13.563
MARISHA: Just turn into compost.

446
00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:14.646
TALIESIN: Eventually.

447
00:15:16.443 --> 00:15:18.021
LAURA: Well, I start dragging the dragonborn

448
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:20.868
through the window into the back storage room.

449
00:15:20.868 --> 00:15:22.659
MATT: (thumping)

450
00:15:22.659 --> 00:15:24.659
Leaves a little trail.

451
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.373
SAM: I think I might--

452
00:15:26.373 --> 00:15:27.558
LAURA: Try to pull the horse through.

453
00:15:27.558 --> 00:15:29.129
SAM: I think I might have messed up, guys!

454
00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:31.841
I don't think the dragonborn was as important

455
00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:34.091
as I had initially thought.

456
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.320
MARISHA: Yeah, pretty sure we just shot the messenger.

457
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.280
SAM: I'm sorry about that!

458
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.448
TALIESIN: Was that why this is-- that's a saying?

459
00:15:43.448 --> 00:15:45.118
MARISHA: Uh, yeah.

460
00:15:45.118 --> 00:15:46.902
SAM: We just invented that phrase.

461
00:15:46.902 --> 00:15:49.520
MARISHA: Look,

462
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.030
I'm a pretty witty person.

463
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.702
SAM: Beauregard just invented the phrase

464
00:15:54.702 --> 00:15:56.960
"don't shoot the messenger."

465
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.793
Canon.

466
00:15:57.793 --> 00:16:00.809
(laughter)

467
00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:02.730
MARISHA: Where's Maruo?

468
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.190
MATT: Currently inside, in the shop behind the counter,

469
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.617
just sitting there watching you all carefully.

470
00:16:08.617 --> 00:16:10.150
MARISHA: Maruo.
MATT: "Yes?"

471
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.983
MARISHA: Do you have any more appointments

472
00:16:10.983 --> 00:16:12.942
on the books for today?

473
00:16:12.942 --> 00:16:15.512
MATT: "Not particularly."

474
00:16:15.512 --> 00:16:16.432
MARISHA: This was it?

475
00:16:16.432 --> 00:16:18.181
This was the only meeting you were booked for?

476
00:16:18.181 --> 00:16:19.301
MATT: "Well, they don't book them in advance.

477
00:16:19.301 --> 00:16:21.089
"They just come in and pay me and use the space.

478
00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:22.691
"It's not like I have an extensive ledger

479
00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.491
"where they contact me weeks in advance

480
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:26.320
"and I fill out a calendar

481
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.315
"and make sure I can fit them in before my morning coffee."

482
00:16:29.315 --> 00:16:31.371
TALIESIN: Insight check, does she have a ledger?

483
00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:32.491
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah!

484
00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:33.429
Please!

485
00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:35.371
TALIESIN: Way too specific.

486
00:16:35.371 --> 00:16:36.779
All right.

487
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.731
That's pretty good.

488
00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:40.898
That's a 22.

489
00:16:40.898 --> 00:16:41.731
MATT: Okay.

490
00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:43.981
(cheering)

491
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.910
SAM: If you couldn't tell by the accent, folks,

492
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.613
you can pick up the newest D&amp;D adventure,

493
00:16:51.613 --> 00:16:54.483
Ghosts of Saltmarsh, today on D&amp;D Beyond.

494
00:16:54.483 --> 00:16:55.972
It's a spooky adventure

495
00:16:55.972 --> 00:16:57.253
and you can get it

496
00:16:57.253 --> 00:16:59.152
only at one place-- well,

497
00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:00.411
I think you can get it more than one place,

498
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:01.653
but you could definitely get it

499
00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:04.087
at D&amp;D Beyond. I'll quit now.

500
00:17:04.087 --> 00:17:06.337
(laughter)

501
00:17:07.403 --> 00:17:08.403
TALIESIN: All right.

502
00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:11.159
Hmm.

503
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:14.659
SAM: Did the drow tell you how long

504
00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:17.790
they were staying upstairs, or...

505
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.623
MATT: "No, they had no

506
00:17:18.623 --> 00:17:20.696
"particular information about it.

507
00:17:20.696 --> 00:17:22.266
"They just paid for the entry fee

508
00:17:22.266 --> 00:17:23.747
"and then took the time

509
00:17:23.747 --> 00:17:25.156
"and if it ever overlaps,

510
00:17:25.156 --> 00:17:27.554
"I tell them to come back later."

511
00:17:27.554 --> 00:17:29.158
MARISHA: How much is the entry fee?

512
00:17:29.158 --> 00:17:30.859
TALIESIN: Just kind of curious, yeah.

513
00:17:30.859 --> 00:17:33.430
MATT: "Per person, it's 25 gold."

514
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.836
MARISHA: Damn, Maruo!

515
00:17:35.836 --> 00:17:37.270
That's a good hustle!

516
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.270
Yeah!

517
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.228
MATT: "Thank you, I appreciate that."
MARISHA: Fuck!

518
00:17:40.228 --> 00:17:42.185
MATT: "Don't do too bad for myself.

519
00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:45.882
"Until, you know, people get murdered in here, but--"

520
00:17:45.882 --> 00:17:46.957
MARISHA: I appreciate it.

521
00:17:46.957 --> 00:17:48.623
TALIESIN: How often do people get murdered in here,

522
00:17:48.623 --> 00:17:49.456
actually?
MATT: "Not very often!

523
00:17:49.456 --> 00:17:50.778
"Because usually I do a much better job

524
00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:52.740
"of keeping it low-key."

525
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.041
TRAVIS: Did we already search the dragonborn body

526
00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:56.240
before we pulled it in the window?

527
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.073
LAURA: Yes.
TRAVIS: We did, okay.

528
00:17:57.073 --> 00:17:58.612
SAM: But we didn't search upstairs.

529
00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:00.776
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think we're about to check upstairs.

530
00:18:00.776 --> 00:18:02.300
SAM: You and I should go upstairs and check around.

531
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.470
TALIESIN: Anything we should know about up there

532
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.681
before we start looking around?

533
00:18:05.681 --> 00:18:06.990
MATT: "Uh..."

534
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.142
TALIESIN: Traps, things with--

535
00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:09.001
MATT: "No traps!

536
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:11.512
"But there is a little switch

537
00:18:11.512 --> 00:18:13.661
"under the table,

538
00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:14.828
"opens a chute."

539
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:17.412
ASHLEY: Where does the chute go?

540
00:18:17.412 --> 00:18:19.062
MATT: She points to the storage room.

541
00:18:19.062 --> 00:18:21.462
TRAVIS: Motherfuck, that's how she got out.

542
00:18:21.462 --> 00:18:22.799
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool, actually.

543
00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.222
That's pretty cool.

544
00:18:24.222 --> 00:18:25.702
SAM: Let's go look.

545
00:18:25.702 --> 00:18:28.171
So Yasha and I will go up and

546
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:29.843
start looking.

547
00:18:29.843 --> 00:18:31.299
TALIESIN: I'll head up-- I may head up as well for this,

548
00:18:31.299 --> 00:18:32.132
with the two.

549
00:18:32.132 --> 00:18:34.320
MATT: Okay. It's a very plain room,

550
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.928
intentionally so. There's no decor.

551
00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:37.749
It's just wood walls,

552
00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:40.000
wood floor. There's the one window

553
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.803
that's shuttered closed in the front.

554
00:18:43.803 --> 00:18:45.676
There are four chairs and there's a table.

555
00:18:45.676 --> 00:18:48.925
The table is bolted to the floor.

556
00:18:48.925 --> 00:18:49.956
You take a moment to look underneath

557
00:18:49.956 --> 00:18:51.826
and you can see underneath the table,

558
00:18:51.826 --> 00:18:53.187
part of the table leg,

559
00:18:53.187 --> 00:18:55.678
there's an additional iron rod

560
00:18:55.678 --> 00:18:58.178
that's pressed up against it.

561
00:18:58.178 --> 00:18:59.239
SAM: An additional iron rod--

562
00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:01.042
MATT: An iron rod on the back of-- on the inside

563
00:19:01.042 --> 00:19:03.540
of one of the table legs.

564
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.852
SAM: Is that the, oh, okay, that's the trap door, yeah.

565
00:19:05.852 --> 00:19:07.602
MATT: Might be, yeah.

566
00:19:07.602 --> 00:19:09.092
MARISHA: It's cool.

567
00:19:09.092 --> 00:19:09.925
ASHLEY: Anything else--

568
00:19:09.925 --> 00:19:10.758
SAM: Should we look around?

569
00:19:10.758 --> 00:19:11.732
ASHLEY: Let's look around.

570
00:19:11.732 --> 00:19:12.565
SAM: Okay.

571
00:19:12.565 --> 00:19:14.322
I'll take the desk.

572
00:19:14.322 --> 00:19:15.391
You want to take the rest of the room?

573
00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:16.391
ASHLEY: Yeah.

574
00:19:16.391 --> 00:19:17.623
MATT: Both of you guys make investigation checks.

575
00:19:17.623 --> 00:19:18.788
LAURA: Can I ask a question?

576
00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:19.621
MATT: Yes, you may.

577
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:21.401
LAURA: Did we-- in the end of the last game,

578
00:19:21.401 --> 00:19:23.041
did we already-- did I already tell Yasha

579
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:24.624
what I heard from the messenger?

580
00:19:24.624 --> 00:19:26.590
Have we talked about that at all?

581
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.222
Did we brush over that

582
00:19:28.222 --> 00:19:29.055
or did it--

583
00:19:29.055 --> 00:19:30.230
MATT: I don't recall,

584
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.809
but you can definitely--

585
00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:32.642
LAURA: Okay.

586
00:19:32.642 --> 00:19:34.469
MATT: You can rekindle that conversation,

587
00:19:34.469 --> 00:19:35.332
if you'd like to clarify.

588
00:19:35.332 --> 00:19:36.165
LAURA: Sure.

589
00:19:36.165 --> 00:19:37.990
SAM: 16 at the desk.

590
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.531
ASHLEY: Eight for the rest of the room.

591
00:19:39.531 --> 00:19:40.630
MATT: Okay.

592
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.547
At the table, the desk,

593
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.942
it's clear. It's a simple table.

594
00:19:46.942 --> 00:19:50.522
This room, aside from that switch,

595
00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:55.522
is intentionally left blank, barren, neutral.

596
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.109
You gather, based on the type

597
00:19:57.109 --> 00:19:59.079
of meetings that might happen here,

598
00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:00.668
it's in the best interests of those

599
00:20:00.668 --> 00:20:02.001
who have come to a place

600
00:20:02.001 --> 00:20:06.193
outside of the visible spectrum of the rest of the city

601
00:20:06.193 --> 00:20:09.860
to find a space of complete safe neutrality.

602
00:20:11.026 --> 00:20:11.859
SAM: Okay.

603
00:20:11.859 --> 00:20:12.904
As we're searching around,

604
00:20:12.904 --> 00:20:15.620
I'm going to, oh.

605
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.388
ASHLEY: It's a square room.

606
00:20:17.388 --> 00:20:18.606
SAM: Yasha, I'm so sorry

607
00:20:18.606 --> 00:20:20.618
that I shot you three times.

608
00:20:20.618 --> 00:20:23.437
I didn't mean to shoot you at all, any times,

609
00:20:23.437 --> 00:20:26.405
but three is even worse than one.

610
00:20:26.405 --> 00:20:29.286
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's okay, Nott. I can take it, obviously.

611
00:20:29.286 --> 00:20:32.927
Just-- I knew you were under something.

612
00:20:32.927 --> 00:20:35.447
But try not to do that again if you can.

613
00:20:35.447 --> 00:20:37.873
SAM: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I...

614
00:20:37.873 --> 00:20:40.559
I'm sorry. I also did all this

615
00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:43.856
and is everyone downstairs mad at me?

616
00:20:43.856 --> 00:20:45.727
ASHLEY: I don't even think

617
00:20:45.727 --> 00:20:48.879
that they're even thinking about it, Nott.

618
00:20:48.879 --> 00:20:50.629
I think there's a lot of other things

619
00:20:50.629 --> 00:20:53.929
that's on everybody else's minds.

620
00:20:55.098 --> 00:20:56.319
You're okay.

621
00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:57.359
SAM: Okay.

622
00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:00.192
ASHLEY: You warned us, we came in, and...

623
00:21:01.807 --> 00:21:03.959
TALIESIN: Are you mad at yourself, I suppose?

624
00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:06.018
SAM: I just got very nervous.

625
00:21:06.018 --> 00:21:06.851
That's all.

626
00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:07.959
ASHLEY: Why did you get nervous?

627
00:21:07.959 --> 00:21:10.229
SAM: Because I haven't been drinking!

628
00:21:10.229 --> 00:21:11.079
ASHLEY: You haven't?

629
00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:14.687
SAM: No, but I think I should start again.

630
00:21:14.687 --> 00:21:17.479
I think I function much better with a little--

631
00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:19.016
ASHLEY: With a little bit of liquid courage?

632
00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:20.177
SAM: Yes.

633
00:21:20.177 --> 00:21:23.018
ASHLEY: Well, you know, I wouldn't tell you not to do--

634
00:21:23.018 --> 00:21:24.978
SAM: That's the kind of advice that I came here for.

635
00:21:24.978 --> 00:21:27.228
(laughter)

636
00:21:28.189 --> 00:21:29.028
LIAM: While she's swigging,

637
00:21:29.028 --> 00:21:30.927
I send Frumpkin to pitter pat

638
00:21:30.927 --> 00:21:32.407
up to the peak of the house

639
00:21:32.407 --> 00:21:33.747
and go blind and deaf in here.

640
00:21:33.747 --> 00:21:35.429
I want to see the streets,

641
00:21:35.429 --> 00:21:39.247
to see what the citizens of the town are doing.

642
00:21:39.247 --> 00:21:40.080
MATT: Okay.

643
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.716
LIAM: Or if there's any guards rushing to

644
00:21:41.716 --> 00:21:43.245
or anything that is a problem.

645
00:21:43.245 --> 00:21:45.112
MATT: Make a perception check for Frumpkin.

646
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:47.837
LIAM: For Frumpkin.
MATT: Yes.

647
00:21:47.837 --> 00:21:48.696
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:21:50.305 --> 00:21:52.056
Beasts, beasts, beasts, creatures.

649
00:21:52.056 --> 00:21:53.896
Where the hell did they go?

650
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:54.979
They're gone!

651
00:21:56.597 --> 00:21:57.923
Well, I rolled a 16,

652
00:21:57.923 --> 00:21:58.936
so I'm going to say 16,

653
00:21:58.936 --> 00:22:01.066
because I don't know where creatures went.

654
00:22:01.066 --> 00:22:01.899
Where'd they go?

655
00:22:01.899 --> 00:22:03.465
Refresh.

656
00:22:03.465 --> 00:22:04.765
MATT: There you go.

657
00:22:04.765 --> 00:22:06.304
So Frumpkin takes a look around there

658
00:22:06.304 --> 00:22:10.734
and I mean, occasionally, you see figures in the street

659
00:22:10.734 --> 00:22:13.547
that are walking and whispering to each other.

660
00:22:13.547 --> 00:22:15.047
They've...

661
00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:18.254
Like any folks who live

662
00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:21.078
in the outer boonies of the city,

663
00:22:21.078 --> 00:22:23.078
word gets around and there's a lot of,

664
00:22:23.078 --> 00:22:24.718
a lot of locals who are passing by

665
00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:26.248
and informing each other

666
00:22:26.248 --> 00:22:29.214
of some sort of scuffle in the street, you may think.

667
00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:31.208
You don't see any guard getting involved at the moment,

668
00:22:31.208 --> 00:22:35.718
but it does seem that, you know, it's being discussed.

669
00:22:35.718 --> 00:22:36.551
LIAM: Okay.

670
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:39.888
I'm going to stay in this state and say:

671
00:22:39.888 --> 00:22:41.801
The people who live here are

672
00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:45.427
talking about this, that is all.

673
00:22:45.427 --> 00:22:46.639
And I stay in it.

674
00:22:46.639 --> 00:22:48.467
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: And watch.

675
00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:50.697
LAURA: We probably shouldn't stay here long, then.

676
00:22:50.697 --> 00:22:52.376
SAM: But wait, what if-- oh, I'm not there.

677
00:22:52.376 --> 00:22:57.202
LAURA: I mean, I don't know if Blondie's--

678
00:22:57.202 --> 00:22:58.943
what did we name him?

679
00:22:58.943 --> 00:22:59.776
TRAVIS: Greg.

680
00:22:59.776 --> 00:23:02.134
LAURA: Greg, if he's going to show up or not.

681
00:23:02.134 --> 00:23:03.294
I don't--

682
00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:05.816
MARISHA: Was the people who were here

683
00:23:05.816 --> 00:23:10.816
his liaisons or was that something totally unrelated?

684
00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:12.998
TRAVIS: Yeah, seems like a transaction was happening

685
00:23:12.998 --> 00:23:14.289
and happened.

686
00:23:14.289 --> 00:23:17.065
LAURA: Maybe he was saying that, you know,

687
00:23:17.065 --> 00:23:18.247
he was sending somebody.

688
00:23:18.247 --> 00:23:21.398
Maybe he never said he was going to be here himself.

689
00:23:21.398 --> 00:23:22.609
MARISHA: Maruo.

690
00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:25.228
MATT: "Yeah?"

691
00:23:25.228 --> 00:23:28.618
MARISHA: The drow man, was he holding anything

692
00:23:28.618 --> 00:23:30.150
when he came in?

693
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.206
Carrying anything?

694
00:23:32.206 --> 00:23:34.689
MATT: "I mean, he had a pouch and travel gear,

695
00:23:34.689 --> 00:23:36.356
"but that's about it."

696
00:23:37.209 --> 00:23:39.318
MARISHA: How big was the pouch?

697
00:23:39.318 --> 00:23:42.455
MATT: "Pouch size, I wasn't paying attention!"

698
00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:44.739
(laughter)

699
00:23:44.739 --> 00:23:46.114
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

700
00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:51.171
MARISHA: You're sure you don't keep any

701
00:23:51.171 --> 00:23:54.057
sign-in sheet, record?

702
00:23:54.057 --> 00:23:54.969
MATT: "That's what I want to do,

703
00:23:54.969 --> 00:23:56.619
"is have a long sheet that implicates me

704
00:23:56.619 --> 00:23:59.276
"on every illegal activity that happens in my shop."

705
00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:01.019
MARISHA: Gives you an alibi.

706
00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:02.497
MATT: "You'd think that!"

707
00:24:03.464 --> 00:24:05.714
TRAVIS: I can't!
MARISHA: All right.

708
00:24:07.627 --> 00:24:09.286
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb,

709
00:24:09.286 --> 00:24:10.387
Mr. Caleb?

710
00:24:10.387 --> 00:24:11.929
LIAM: Totally deaf.

711
00:24:11.929 --> 00:24:13.627
LAURA: He's busy, his mind

712
00:24:13.627 --> 00:24:16.137
is in another person thing right now.

713
00:24:16.137 --> 00:24:18.207
Do you need us to tell him something?

714
00:24:18.207 --> 00:24:19.040
TRAVIS: Yeah.

715
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.238
TALIESIN: I'm going to come down.

716
00:24:20.238 --> 00:24:21.657
LAURA: I'm going to go upstairs.

717
00:24:21.657 --> 00:24:22.609
TALIESIN: Oh, hey, I--

718
00:24:22.609 --> 00:24:23.442
LAURA: Sorry, I'm sorry.

719
00:24:23.442 --> 00:24:24.337
Pardon me, sorry, these are--

720
00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:26.475
TALIESIN: Okay, this is just, I'll go left.

721
00:24:26.475 --> 00:24:27.308
LAURA: I'll go right.

722
00:24:27.308 --> 00:24:29.055
TALIESIN: Right, this is fine.

723
00:24:29.055 --> 00:24:32.014
LIAM: Hello, bees!

724
00:24:32.014 --> 00:24:34.225
MATT: All right, you head upstairs.

725
00:24:34.225 --> 00:24:35.625
LAURA: You, I head upstairs, he has--

726
00:24:35.625 --> 00:24:37.442
MATT: No, you head upstairs, you go downstairs.

727
00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:38.545
TALIESIN: I was thinking, if there's a way

728
00:24:38.545 --> 00:24:41.553
that we could maybe magically keep tabs on the room,

729
00:24:41.553 --> 00:24:43.374
I don't know if there's a thread thing

730
00:24:43.374 --> 00:24:45.002
or if there's a thing you can do to

731
00:24:45.002 --> 00:24:47.987
alert us if people are in there.

732
00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:49.126
MARISHA: If we leave something behind,

733
00:24:49.126 --> 00:24:51.876
then Jester can scry through it.

734
00:24:52.785 --> 00:24:54.202
TALIESIN: Not a bad idea.

735
00:24:55.595 --> 00:24:56.428
Jester!

736
00:24:57.303 --> 00:24:59.846
LAURA: Hold on, I'm in the middle of something!

737
00:24:59.846 --> 00:25:03.005
I'm in the middle of talking to Yasha.

738
00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:04.422
MATT: (laughs) All right, so Jester.

739
00:25:04.422 --> 00:25:05.255
LAURA: Yasha?

740
00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:06.088
ASHLEY: Yeah?

741
00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:07.501
LAURA: Did you know that guy

742
00:25:07.501 --> 00:25:09.113
that you were fighting?

743
00:25:09.113 --> 00:25:13.863
ASHLEY: I've never seen either of them before in my life.

744
00:25:14.992 --> 00:25:17.273
LAURA: Because I think he knows you.

745
00:25:17.273 --> 00:25:18.135
ASHLEY: Yeah.

746
00:25:18.135 --> 00:25:21.303
It seems-- that seems-- it seems like it.

747
00:25:21.303 --> 00:25:22.164
LAURA: Well, okay.

748
00:25:22.164 --> 00:25:24.232
When I was sending you a message,

749
00:25:24.232 --> 00:25:26.479
I was trying to fake him out, right,

750
00:25:26.479 --> 00:25:29.527
that he should come back here, and anyway,

751
00:25:29.527 --> 00:25:31.207
he didn't fall for it.

752
00:25:31.207 --> 00:25:34.874
But he was like, "Follow me north, bring her."

753
00:25:36.974 --> 00:25:38.345
SAM: "Bring her," meaning?

754
00:25:38.345 --> 00:25:40.705
LAURA: I think he means Yasha!

755
00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:41.716
ASHLEY: You do?

756
00:25:41.716 --> 00:25:43.887
LAURA: That's kind of what I thought, you know.

757
00:25:43.887 --> 00:25:44.727
ASHLEY: Did he say why?

758
00:25:44.727 --> 00:25:46.916
LAURA: No, he didn't, and here's the crazy part,

759
00:25:46.916 --> 00:25:50.031
okay, because you know I've used this spell a lot, okay?

760
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:52.389
And, and, okay.

761
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:54.419
So he never saw me, right?

762
00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:57.741
Like I never saw that guy, ever.

763
00:25:57.741 --> 00:26:01.573
Somehow when I sent him the message,

764
00:26:01.573 --> 00:26:04.082
He knew it was me.

765
00:26:04.082 --> 00:26:05.653
SAM: He knew who you were?

766
00:26:05.653 --> 00:26:07.482
LAURA: Yeah, he was like, "I know you."

767
00:26:07.482 --> 00:26:08.933
ASHLEY: That's not what usually happens.

768
00:26:08.933 --> 00:26:10.120
You usually send it

769
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.149
and you have to say who you are?

770
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:13.298
LAURA: Well, yeah, unless they know me,

771
00:26:13.298 --> 00:26:14.728
they don't know it's me.

772
00:26:14.728 --> 00:26:16.530
SAM: He's been spying on us?

773
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.098
LAURA: I mean, what if he's scrying on us

774
00:26:18.098 --> 00:26:20.758
the way that I've been scrying on other people?

775
00:26:20.758 --> 00:26:23.507
SAM: To scry, you need to know someone

776
00:26:23.507 --> 00:26:25.629
traveling in a party, correct?

777
00:26:25.629 --> 00:26:27.656
LAURA: Right, or know of them.

778
00:26:27.656 --> 00:26:30.829
He could know about you or something

779
00:26:30.829 --> 00:26:33.162
and have been, I don't know!

780
00:26:36.003 --> 00:26:40.307
ASHLEY: I don't think I've ever seen him before, I--

781
00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:42.486
SAM: Sometimes when I can't think of someone,

782
00:26:42.486 --> 00:26:45.206
I think of the first letter of their name.

783
00:26:45.206 --> 00:26:46.686
Does it start with A?

784
00:26:46.686 --> 00:26:48.145
Does it start with B?

785
00:26:48.145 --> 00:26:50.158
Go through the alphabet that way.

786
00:26:50.158 --> 00:26:51.366
LAURA: What?

787
00:26:51.366 --> 00:26:54.620
SAM: You know, like was her name Agatha?

788
00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.238
ASHLEY: Sounding out.

789
00:26:57.238 --> 00:26:58.071
Uh.

790
00:27:01.257 --> 00:27:05.205
Is there anything, thinking of him.

791
00:27:05.205 --> 00:27:06.166
LAURA: Because I think he might have been

792
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.726
disguising himself or something.

793
00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:09.644
I mean, I would have disguised myself,

794
00:27:09.644 --> 00:27:13.426
coming in here. I did, actually, disguise myself as a moth.

795
00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:15.547
It didn't work very well.

796
00:27:15.547 --> 00:27:17.779
ASHLEY: You got a taste of some curtains and--

797
00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:18.928
LAURA: They were so good.

798
00:27:18.928 --> 00:27:19.798
ASHLEY: Yay, that's--

799
00:27:19.798 --> 00:27:21.675
LAURA: Actually, while we're discussing this,

800
00:27:21.675 --> 00:27:22.974
I walk over to the curtains

801
00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:25.976
and give them a little munch as myself as well.

802
00:27:25.976 --> 00:27:26.809
MATT: Okay.

803
00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:29.666
Somehow less tasty in your current form.

804
00:27:29.666 --> 00:27:31.491
LAURA: No? Doesn't translate.

805
00:27:32.781 --> 00:27:36.544
SAM: So you don't remember this person at all?

806
00:27:36.544 --> 00:27:39.794
ASHLEY: If I think really hard on it, does...

807
00:27:40.864 --> 00:27:43.634
Does he seem familiar to me at all?

808
00:27:43.634 --> 00:27:45.075
MATT: Not particularly.

809
00:27:45.075 --> 00:27:46.867
You've not...

810
00:27:46.867 --> 00:27:50.776
You've not encountered many or interacted with many drow

811
00:27:50.776 --> 00:27:53.331
in the time that you grew up,

812
00:27:53.331 --> 00:27:57.061
in the Iothia Moorlands, for the most part

813
00:27:57.061 --> 00:27:58.534
the tribes there keep away

814
00:27:58.534 --> 00:28:01.841
and don't get involved in the Kryn.

815
00:28:01.841 --> 00:28:04.562
So you have no recollection

816
00:28:04.562 --> 00:28:08.141
of meeting this individual before.

817
00:28:08.141 --> 00:28:10.682
LAURA: He said, "Come north."

818
00:28:10.682 --> 00:28:14.201
SAM: Downstairs, didn't the hobby gobby

819
00:28:14.201 --> 00:28:16.201
also call you something?

820
00:28:17.741 --> 00:28:19.322
ASHLEY: Ah, yes.

821
00:28:19.322 --> 00:28:20.513
He...

822
00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:24.090
He called me by the name

823
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.282
that was given to me by my tribe.

824
00:28:26.282 --> 00:28:28.191
SAM: Which was Orphan Maker?

825
00:28:28.191 --> 00:28:29.024
ASHLEY: Yes.

826
00:28:30.061 --> 00:28:33.111
SAM: That is a cool-ass name, by the way.

827
00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:33.944
ASHLEY: Well...

828
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.381
Thank you, but

829
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:41.770
it's a little weird that someone knows my name

830
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.021
and I don't know who they are.

831
00:28:44.021 --> 00:28:45.540
So.

832
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.971
LAURA: So the Orphan Maker was a name that you liked?

833
00:28:48.971 --> 00:28:51.460
ASHLEY: Well, not particularly.

834
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.420
I mean, my name is Yasha, but you know,

835
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.337
when you...

836
00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:01.539
SAM and LAURA: Oh!

837
00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:02.811
ASHLEY: Checking something.

838
00:29:02.811 --> 00:29:04.211
MARISHA: Something to do with backstory.

839
00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:05.748
LAURA: Reference!

840
00:29:05.748 --> 00:29:06.737
ASHLEY: Just checking something.

841
00:29:06.737 --> 00:29:08.470
SAM: Did you make an orphan

842
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.288
by killing someone's parents?

843
00:29:11.288 --> 00:29:12.455
ASHLEY: No, I think,

844
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.419
(stammers) when...

845
00:29:17.419 --> 00:29:22.252
(sighs) When you're taken into the tribe,

846
00:29:23.968 --> 00:29:27.379
you, I feel like maybe I have told you guys this before.

847
00:29:27.379 --> 00:29:28.539
LAURA: Yeah, I think you totally have.

848
00:29:28.539 --> 00:29:31.952
ASHLEY: Yeah, you take a blood oath that they call the

849
00:29:31.952 --> 00:29:33.801
marking and when you take it, they give you

850
00:29:33.801 --> 00:29:35.417
a name in the tribe.

851
00:29:35.417 --> 00:29:37.731
The name that was given to me was Orphan Maker.

852
00:29:37.731 --> 00:29:39.747
SAM: But why that one?

853
00:29:39.747 --> 00:29:41.579
LAURA: Because she's really tough, you know that?

854
00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:43.659
ASHLEY: We all have names like that, you know.

855
00:29:43.659 --> 00:29:44.720
LAURA: Yeah!

856
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.129
Why am I the Little Sapphire?

857
00:29:46.129 --> 00:29:48.929
I never knew. I couldn't figure it out, you know?

858
00:29:48.929 --> 00:29:50.409
SAM: You're shiny and blue and beautiful.

859
00:29:50.409 --> 00:29:51.992
LAURA: Like a... oh!
ASHLEY: Yeah!

860
00:29:52.998 --> 00:29:55.329
LAURA: That makes perfect sense, actually, yeah.

861
00:29:55.329 --> 00:29:57.216
ASHLEY: You are a Little Sapphire.

862
00:29:57.216 --> 00:29:58.720
SAM: Which leads me to believe that maybe Yasha

863
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.910
has killed someone's parents.

864
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:02.269
ASHLEY: No, I don't think it's like that.

865
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:05.419
I think you're all given a name

866
00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:07.419
in your tribe that maybe

867
00:30:10.096 --> 00:30:13.598
calls out whatever your destiny will be.

868
00:30:13.598 --> 00:30:16.097
SAM: Oh boy! Rough!

869
00:30:16.097 --> 00:30:16.930
ASHLEY: I think you know, it's all--

870
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.430
we're all given names that are

871
00:30:20.487 --> 00:30:21.515
supposed to sound scary.

872
00:30:21.515 --> 00:30:23.423
LAURA: What are some of the other scary names

873
00:30:23.423 --> 00:30:24.439
that people got?

874
00:30:24.439 --> 00:30:25.347
SAM: Oh yeah!

875
00:30:25.347 --> 00:30:26.787
Were they all dark and--

876
00:30:26.787 --> 00:30:29.627
ASHLEY: Yeah, they're all dark and they're scary.

877
00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:30.728
SAM: Turtledove.

878
00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:32.535
ASHLEY: Turtledove, yeah.

879
00:30:32.535 --> 00:30:34.728
TRAVIS: Cherry Blossom.

880
00:30:34.728 --> 00:30:36.438
ASHLEY: Fluffernutter.

881
00:30:36.438 --> 00:30:37.865
SAM: Oh!

882
00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:40.307
ASHLEY: They're all, you know, big and scary names.

883
00:30:40.307 --> 00:30:41.518
SAM and LAURA: Okay, okay.

884
00:30:41.518 --> 00:30:42.753
TRAVIS: Arterial Spray?

885
00:30:42.753 --> 00:30:44.432
(laughter)

886
00:30:44.432 --> 00:30:45.265
ASHLEY: Yes.

887
00:30:46.633 --> 00:30:47.633
But they're all like that.

888
00:30:47.633 --> 00:30:50.393
They're supposed to-- when you meet

889
00:30:50.393 --> 00:30:52.345
other people or other tribes,

890
00:30:52.345 --> 00:30:55.345
they're supposed to incite fear and

891
00:30:56.324 --> 00:30:59.265
I don't think-- I never

892
00:31:00.365 --> 00:31:02.081
took that name to heart.

893
00:31:02.081 --> 00:31:04.164
I mean, my name is Yasha.

894
00:31:05.412 --> 00:31:08.372
But it's weird that they know that

895
00:31:08.372 --> 00:31:11.583
because that was only known in my tribe.

896
00:31:11.583 --> 00:31:12.880
LAURA: Woof.

897
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.314
Do you want to follow him north?

898
00:31:18.121 --> 00:31:20.449
ASHLEY: I mean, I want to know

899
00:31:20.449 --> 00:31:22.481
why they know who I am.

900
00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:23.969
LAURA: Because we could do it.

901
00:31:23.969 --> 00:31:25.214
We could go after him.

902
00:31:25.214 --> 00:31:26.047
ASHLEY: (sighs)

903
00:31:28.456 --> 00:31:29.464
Maybe.

904
00:31:29.464 --> 00:31:30.968
We'll see.

905
00:31:30.968 --> 00:31:32.138
We'll talk with everyone and see

906
00:31:32.138 --> 00:31:34.018
what everyone wants to do.

907
00:31:34.018 --> 00:31:35.018
TRAVIS: Hey, Nott!

908
00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:35.851
SAM: What?

909
00:31:35.851 --> 00:31:37.449
TRAVIS: You pull that damn switch yet?

910
00:31:37.449 --> 00:31:39.300
MARISHA: Yeah, we were staring

911
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.519
at the stupid chute, seeing what happens.

912
00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:42.719
TALIESIN: I totally forgot.

913
00:31:42.719 --> 00:31:44.020
TRAVIS: You break it, or what?

914
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.759
SAM: I will flip the switch.

915
00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:48.768
MATT: Flip the switch, and the back corner of the room

916
00:31:48.768 --> 00:31:50.488
(creaking) comes loose.

917
00:31:50.488 --> 00:31:52.664
There's a little latch that's let loose,

918
00:31:52.664 --> 00:31:54.565
and as it flies open, you guys watch

919
00:31:54.565 --> 00:31:57.454
as part of the ceiling in the storage chamber

920
00:31:57.454 --> 00:31:59.165
that's off to the side of the apothecary,

921
00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:02.297
hangs open at an angle, and there's room for somebody

922
00:32:02.297 --> 00:32:03.130
to slide down.

923
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.543
LAURA: Woo! I go slide down it.

924
00:32:04.543 --> 00:32:05.376
MATT: Okay.

925
00:32:05.376 --> 00:32:06.305
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

926
00:32:06.305 --> 00:32:07.915
TALIESIN: It's like an action figure play set.

927
00:32:07.915 --> 00:32:10.604
LIAM: I just told Frumpkin to keep look out

928
00:32:10.604 --> 00:32:13.174
and tell me if anything comes close

929
00:32:13.174 --> 00:32:14.425
or if there's any sort of stir

930
00:32:14.425 --> 00:32:15.534
beyond what I've already seen

931
00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:17.812
and drop down. What are we doing?

932
00:32:17.812 --> 00:32:19.395
TRAVIS: I think we're going to check out--

933
00:32:19.395 --> 00:32:21.206
LAURA: I land on Caleb coming down the--

934
00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:23.515
(impact)

935
00:32:23.515 --> 00:32:24.723
Hi!

936
00:32:24.723 --> 00:32:27.276
TRAVIS: Heads up, Jester incoming.

937
00:32:27.276 --> 00:32:28.715
TALIESIN: We ever check out that weird magic door

938
00:32:28.715 --> 00:32:30.053
in the back corner by the way, or no?

939
00:32:30.053 --> 00:32:30.973
LAURA: A plane?

940
00:32:30.973 --> 00:32:32.462
SAM: A plan!

941
00:32:32.462 --> 00:32:35.224
MATT: That was-- that was the bodyguard.

942
00:32:35.224 --> 00:32:36.544
TALIESIN: Thank you.

943
00:32:36.544 --> 00:32:37.377
Thank you, brain.

944
00:32:37.377 --> 00:32:38.330
MATT: It's all good.

945
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.861
TALIESIN: Perhaps not.

946
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:41.370
LAURA: I sent the message to the guy,

947
00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.510
he said, "Follow me north if you really want to talk to me,"

948
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.090
or something. And he said, "Bring her,"

949
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.941
and I think he means Yasha,

950
00:32:47.941 --> 00:32:49.991
and we're probably going to go, right?

951
00:32:49.991 --> 00:32:51.617
MARISHA: What's up, Orphan Maker?

952
00:32:51.617 --> 00:32:53.452
ASHLEY: (uncomfortable sigh)

953
00:32:53.452 --> 00:32:54.850
TRAVIS: I mean, look, we're counting on this, right?

954
00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.152
We said we were going to deliver,

955
00:32:56.152 --> 00:32:57.261
if we come back empty-handed,

956
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:58.719
we're not going to look too--

957
00:32:58.719 --> 00:33:01.048
LIAM: Correct, what about these two?

958
00:33:01.048 --> 00:33:01.881
LAURA: They don't care.

959
00:33:01.881 --> 00:33:04.029
LIAM: The mess, are you sure?

960
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:06.509
TRAVIS: No, I actually think Caleb's right.

961
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:08.778
All right, Maruo, you've got to die.

962
00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:10.160
MATT: "Wait, what?"

963
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.730
TRAVIS: Any last words?

964
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.717
MATT: "No, no, no! Look, I have been cordial,

965
00:33:13.717 --> 00:33:16.208
"I have been very up front about all of this!"

966
00:33:16.208 --> 00:33:17.160
TALIESIN: I am actually of the opinion

967
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.880
that there might be an option here.

968
00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.213
TRAVIS: I'm listening.

969
00:33:21.148 --> 00:33:22.773
TALIESIN: I think that we can come

970
00:33:22.773 --> 00:33:25.203
to a financial arrangement.

971
00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:26.167
TRAVIS: Go on.

972
00:33:26.167 --> 00:33:27.688
TALIESIN: I think that maybe,

973
00:33:27.688 --> 00:33:29.757
we can leave a little gold.

974
00:33:29.757 --> 00:33:32.786
In return, nothing is spoken of

975
00:33:32.786 --> 00:33:35.738
and maybe if any of this party,

976
00:33:35.738 --> 00:33:37.648
especially if we leave a small sketch

977
00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:39.106
of who we're looking for, arrives,

978
00:33:39.106 --> 00:33:41.935
we are simply, gently alerted.

979
00:33:41.935 --> 00:33:46.349
In return, everything is left as it is.

980
00:33:46.349 --> 00:33:49.349
I mean, to be fair, even if

981
00:33:49.349 --> 00:33:50.869
we leave right now, with

982
00:33:50.869 --> 00:33:52.248
the giant pile of bodies in here,

983
00:33:52.248 --> 00:33:54.519
is a big problem for these two, anyway.

984
00:33:54.519 --> 00:33:56.886
TRAVIS: That is true. Where's Jester at?

985
00:33:56.886 --> 00:33:58.048
LAURA: I'm on top of Caleb.

986
00:33:58.048 --> 00:33:59.598
TRAVIS: Hey!
LAURA: Hi!

987
00:33:59.598 --> 00:34:02.800
TRAVIS: Hey, Jessie. You still got that spell that lets you

988
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.189
track people wherever they go

989
00:34:05.189 --> 00:34:08.568
and so they are incentivized to play along

990
00:34:08.568 --> 00:34:09.651
with what we ask?
LAURA: Obviously.

991
00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:12.068
TRAVIS: Why don't you do that on old (clicking) over here.

992
00:34:12.068 --> 00:34:12.901
LAURA: You've got it.

993
00:34:12.901 --> 00:34:14.984
MATT: Make a deception check.

994
00:34:17.258 --> 00:34:18.314
TRAVIS: 20.

995
00:34:18.314 --> 00:34:19.399
SAM: (echoing) 20.

996
00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:20.232
MATT: Maruo goes,

997
00:34:20.232 --> 00:34:21.837
"I, meep--"

998
00:34:21.837 --> 00:34:24.608
LAURA: I hold up my Traveler symbol.

999
00:34:24.608 --> 00:34:28.877
I say: Blanky blanky doo, shallagam, shalloo!

1000
00:34:28.877 --> 00:34:33.744
(laughter)

1001
00:34:33.744 --> 00:34:35.977
I use Thaumaturgy to flare my eyes.

1002
00:34:35.977 --> 00:34:37.336
MATT: "Gah!"

1003
00:34:37.336 --> 00:34:39.758
LAURA: And blow his hair back.

1004
00:34:39.758 --> 00:34:41.124
Her hair back.

1005
00:34:41.124 --> 00:34:42.252
(puffs air)

1006
00:34:42.252 --> 00:34:43.463
Yeah.

1007
00:34:43.463 --> 00:34:44.834
All right, you've been marked.

1008
00:34:44.834 --> 00:34:46.033
TRAVIS: That does it.

1009
00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:47.374
LAURA: Don't you fuck us over,

1010
00:34:47.374 --> 00:34:49.706
because it could go bad for you.

1011
00:34:49.706 --> 00:34:51.424
MATT: "Oh, it's okay!"

1012
00:34:51.424 --> 00:34:52.354
TRAVIS: Did you do the really strong one

1013
00:34:52.354 --> 00:34:53.914
where they just die instantly

1014
00:34:53.914 --> 00:34:54.786
if they break their--

1015
00:34:54.786 --> 00:34:57.464
LAURA: That's the only one I know.

1016
00:34:57.464 --> 00:34:59.835
TALIESIN: I got to say, there's a possibility

1017
00:34:59.835 --> 00:35:01.715
that after this has blown over

1018
00:35:01.715 --> 00:35:03.955
maybe this could turn into a fruitful relationship

1019
00:35:03.955 --> 00:35:05.344
for everybody involved.

1020
00:35:05.344 --> 00:35:07.184
MATT: "I'm all about fruitful relationships."

1021
00:35:07.184 --> 00:35:08.614
TALIESIN: I knew you would be.

1022
00:35:08.614 --> 00:35:09.734
LIAM: You certainly do not want

1023
00:35:09.734 --> 00:35:12.103
to piss off the Empress herself.

1024
00:35:12.103 --> 00:35:12.936
MATT: "No.

1025
00:35:12.936 --> 00:35:14.436
"No, very confused.

1026
00:35:15.272 --> 00:35:16.189
"In general."

1027
00:35:17.174 --> 00:35:19.944
LIAM: That's good, you don't want to know all the details.

1028
00:35:19.944 --> 00:35:23.224
MATT: "I do not at all."
LIAM: You just want to know what we tell you

1029
00:35:23.224 --> 00:35:24.520
MATT: "Mm-hmm!"

1030
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.270
TALIESIN: We're well known for our mixed messages,

1031
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:27.278
it's part of who we are.

1032
00:35:27.278 --> 00:35:29.640
TRAVIS: Who was in your shop today?

1033
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.691
MATT: "I don't know."

1034
00:35:30.691 --> 00:35:32.000
TRAVIS: Mmm, mm-hmm.

1035
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.536
How did all these bodies get in here?

1036
00:35:34.536 --> 00:35:36.638
MATT: "It's the craziest thing!

1037
00:35:36.638 --> 00:35:39.138
"I woke up and they were there."

1038
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.798
TRAVIS: We'll do well, yeah.

1039
00:35:41.798 --> 00:35:44.768
TALIESIN: Actually, yeah, I might suggest

1040
00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:47.518
that we take a couple of these bodies with us.

1041
00:35:47.518 --> 00:35:48.539
MATT: "See, that's great, too!

1042
00:35:48.539 --> 00:35:49.968
"Please, that'd be great!"

1043
00:35:49.968 --> 00:35:51.340
SAM: Oh, to talk to them?

1044
00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.059
MATT: "(whispers) They're very heavy."

1045
00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:54.249
TRAVIS: We could take them underneath, right?

1046
00:35:54.249 --> 00:35:55.643
TALIESIN: Given the circumstances--

1047
00:35:55.643 --> 00:35:56.883
SAM: You could talk to the dragonborn.

1048
00:35:56.883 --> 00:35:58.792
What they brought.

1049
00:35:58.792 --> 00:36:00.050
TALIESIN: I'd like to talk to both of them,

1050
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.883
to be honest.

1051
00:36:00.883 --> 00:36:01.842
TRAVIS: Where's this tunnel go?

1052
00:36:01.842 --> 00:36:03.572
Can we take them down to the tunnel for now?

1053
00:36:03.572 --> 00:36:05.297
LAURA: The tunnel goes from the second floor

1054
00:36:05.297 --> 00:36:06.334
to the first floor.

1055
00:36:06.334 --> 00:36:09.262
MARISHA: Both of them including the horse?

1056
00:36:09.262 --> 00:36:11.494
TALIESIN: No, there's two bodies.

1057
00:36:11.494 --> 00:36:13.824
ASHLEY: The hobgoblin and the dragonborn.

1058
00:36:13.824 --> 00:36:15.744
MARISHA: Oh yeah, let's talk to them.

1059
00:36:15.744 --> 00:36:17.544
Because I'm not a hundred percent convinced

1060
00:36:17.544 --> 00:36:19.424
that these were the people we were looking for.

1061
00:36:19.424 --> 00:36:21.674
LAURA: You talk to them. I'll talk to the horse.

1062
00:36:21.674 --> 00:36:23.172
TALIESIN: Okay.

1063
00:36:23.172 --> 00:36:25.563
Do you know how to speak horse?

1064
00:36:25.563 --> 00:36:27.752
LAURA: I know how to talk to dead horses.

1065
00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:28.585
TALIESIN: Is that true?

1066
00:36:28.585 --> 00:36:29.418
LAURA: Yeah.

1067
00:36:29.418 --> 00:36:30.251
TALIESIN: Wow.

1068
00:36:30.251 --> 00:36:31.626
That's cool.
SAM: Just don't beat a dead horse.

1069
00:36:31.626 --> 00:36:33.400
TALIESIN: I actually can't talk to them until tomorrow.

1070
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.691
SAM: I just invented that phrase.

1071
00:36:34.691 --> 00:36:35.630
TRAVIS: You can't?

1072
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.956
TALIESIN: Not 'til tomorrow.

1073
00:36:37.956 --> 00:36:39.364
MARISHA and SAM: Canon.

1074
00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:40.970
SAM: Just to clarify.

1075
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:45.132
We were supposed to intercept Greg, Blonde Greg.

1076
00:36:45.132 --> 00:36:45.965
LAURA: Yeah.

1077
00:36:45.965 --> 00:36:47.863
SAM: Who you definitely heard say

1078
00:36:47.863 --> 00:36:50.063
that he was coming here in person?

1079
00:36:50.063 --> 00:36:51.896
LAURA: Okay, do I remember?

1080
00:36:52.879 --> 00:36:55.012
If I definitely heard that he was coming

1081
00:36:55.012 --> 00:36:58.852
or I just heard the date and the arrival?

1082
00:36:58.852 --> 00:37:01.823
MATT: Let me look up the specific words.

1083
00:37:01.823 --> 00:37:05.594
To ensure that I'm not getting this wrong for you either.

1084
00:37:05.594 --> 00:37:06.982
SAM: All right.

1085
00:37:06.982 --> 00:37:09.183
MATT: Just a second, I've got to go to my Dropbox.

1086
00:37:09.183 --> 00:37:11.433
(laughter)

1087
00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:13.962
TRAVIS: Your notes are dope.

1088
00:37:13.962 --> 00:37:17.252
SAM: She has so many notes, how do you find anything?

1089
00:37:17.252 --> 00:37:19.322
LAURA: That's why I don't write anything down anymore,

1090
00:37:19.322 --> 00:37:21.732
because I figure she's going to know it.

1091
00:37:21.732 --> 00:37:24.232
MARISHA: Well, what I wrote down was:

1092
00:37:25.332 --> 00:37:27.252
Has the emblem.

1093
00:37:27.252 --> 00:37:29.330
At the Overcrow.

1094
00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.711
You want to meet up in the next week?

1095
00:37:31.711 --> 00:37:33.380
No, there are six days.

1096
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.681
No, that's too soon.

1097
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:36.082
13 days.

1098
00:37:36.082 --> 00:37:40.412
Then they mentioned a female and her paranoia.

1099
00:37:40.412 --> 00:37:41.458
And that's what I got.

1100
00:37:41.458 --> 00:37:43.522
MATT: Sounds about right. We'll go with that.

1101
00:37:43.522 --> 00:37:45.508
LAURA: Female paranoia's probably the Bright Queen.

1102
00:37:45.508 --> 00:37:47.060
SAM: But Greg didn't say,

1103
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.602
"I will be there personally in 13 days."

1104
00:37:49.602 --> 00:37:52.140
TRAVIS: This thing will happen at the Overcrow.

1105
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.852
LAURA: Okay, so this is what happened.

1106
00:37:53.852 --> 00:37:56.122
We got the money

1107
00:37:56.122 --> 00:37:58.551
and now he's got the emblem or whatever it is that--

1108
00:37:58.551 --> 00:37:59.991
MATT: Says, yes I have the emblem,

1109
00:37:59.991 --> 00:38:00.824
waiting for a window,

1110
00:38:00.824 --> 00:38:02.943
but let's plot for the next Grissen,

1111
00:38:02.943 --> 00:38:05.726
wait, Grissen the week after. The Overcrow.

1112
00:38:05.726 --> 00:38:07.084
TRAVIS: Yes, I have the emblem?

1113
00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:07.917
MARISHA: He had the emblem.

1114
00:38:07.917 --> 00:38:09.724
TRAVIS: Is he going to be trading

1115
00:38:09.724 --> 00:38:12.202
under the Bright Queen's emblem into some--

1116
00:38:12.202 --> 00:38:13.402
SAM: So Greg sent the emblem,

1117
00:38:13.402 --> 00:38:16.514
sold it for 50 platinum, right?

1118
00:38:16.514 --> 00:38:17.914
MARISHA: We don't know.

1119
00:38:17.914 --> 00:38:20.053
SAM: Well, that's, there was 50 platinum involved.

1120
00:38:20.053 --> 00:38:21.933
MARISHA: We don't know if this--

1121
00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:23.874
she's said-- how many meetings

1122
00:38:23.874 --> 00:38:26.751
do you usually have in a day, Maruo?

1123
00:38:26.751 --> 00:38:30.730
MATT: "Like one a week, it's not that often."

1124
00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.183
TALIESIN: This was the only one today?

1125
00:38:33.183 --> 00:38:34.615
MATT: "The only one today, yeah."

1126
00:38:34.615 --> 00:38:35.448
LAURA: That she knows of.

1127
00:38:35.448 --> 00:38:37.114
TRAVIS: This may be stupid, but if they have the emblem

1128
00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.253
and it's similar to our emblems,

1129
00:38:38.253 --> 00:38:40.194
are they trying to create a distraction on the war front

1130
00:38:40.194 --> 00:38:41.903
so they can do a singular attack

1131
00:38:41.903 --> 00:38:42.823
here, and try and hit somebody

1132
00:38:42.823 --> 00:38:44.335
of high importance with that emblem?

1133
00:38:44.335 --> 00:38:48.180
Like a fucking DEF CON one badge?

1134
00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.850
TALIESIN: I feel like that's-- I don't know.

1135
00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.242
That feels like an awful lot of--

1136
00:38:51.242 --> 00:38:53.291
MARISHA: They mentioned putting Scourgers in,

1137
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:54.680
I don't know.

1138
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.255
TRAVIS: Okay, should we go north?

1139
00:38:56.255 --> 00:38:58.630
LAURA: Let's go, we have to follow him.

1140
00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.130
LIAM: We can't be left here holding the bag.

1141
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.420
LAURA: Let's follow him.

1142
00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.472
MARISHA: Yasha, do you recognize anything--

1143
00:39:05.472 --> 00:39:06.821
SAM: Oh yeah, upstairs--

1144
00:39:06.821 --> 00:39:10.051
Upstairs Yasha said something really interesting

1145
00:39:10.051 --> 00:39:12.401
right after the stream ended last week.

1146
00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:13.763
About the word--

1147
00:39:13.763 --> 00:39:14.602
LAURA: Although we didn't know,

1148
00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:17.747
we didn't hear it, so tell us what you overheard, Nott.

1149
00:39:17.747 --> 00:39:18.580
Tell us everything--

1150
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.360
SAM: Oh yes, I heard,

1151
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.411
the only word that I clearly heard

1152
00:39:22.411 --> 00:39:24.341
was Bazozian.

1153
00:39:24.341 --> 00:39:25.668
MARISHA: Bazzoxan.

1154
00:39:25.668 --> 00:39:26.689
ASHLEY: In Bazzoxan.

1155
00:39:26.689 --> 00:39:28.897
SAM: Bazozian!

1156
00:39:28.897 --> 00:39:30.680
ASHLEY: Wait a minute, I think that's a place.

1157
00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.471
ALL: Oh!

1158
00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:36.390
ASHLEY: It sounds so familiar for some reason to me.

1159
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.282
I don't know if I've been there,

1160
00:39:37.282 --> 00:39:39.549
but I feel like I've seen it on the map.

1161
00:39:39.549 --> 00:39:40.382
LAURA: Look at the map.

1162
00:39:40.382 --> 00:39:41.215
SAM: Yasha!

1163
00:39:41.215 --> 00:39:42.602
I think you're right.

1164
00:39:42.602 --> 00:39:45.288
MARISHA: You're so right; it's right above this blood spray.

1165
00:39:45.288 --> 00:39:46.482
Bazzoxan.

1166
00:39:46.482 --> 00:39:48.450
LAURA: It's north, that's where he said to follow.

1167
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:49.309
MARISHA: It is 100 percent--

1168
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:51.319
SAM: Great thinking, Yashy!

1169
00:39:51.319 --> 00:39:52.538
ASHLEY: Yashy?!

1170
00:39:52.538 --> 00:39:54.406
(laughter)

1171
00:39:54.406 --> 00:39:56.458
SAM: Or would you prefer Orphy?

1172
00:39:56.458 --> 00:39:57.291
ASHLEY: Nope!

1173
00:39:57.291 --> 00:39:59.541
(laughter)

1174
00:40:00.727 --> 00:40:02.045
TALIESIN: So.

1175
00:40:02.045 --> 00:40:05.447
How many days' ride do you think that is?

1176
00:40:05.447 --> 00:40:06.738
Bazzoxan?

1177
00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:07.571
MARISHA: I don't know.

1178
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:09.098
ASHLEY: Where are we at right now?

1179
00:40:09.098 --> 00:40:11.086
MATT: If you want to,

1180
00:40:11.086 --> 00:40:14.786
both Fjord and Beauregard,

1181
00:40:14.786 --> 00:40:17.021
make an intelligence saving--

1182
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:18.666
or an intelligence check, please.

1183
00:40:18.666 --> 00:40:20.074
MARISHA: On this?
MATT: On the map, yeah.

1184
00:40:20.074 --> 00:40:22.023
Trying to look up distances and--

1185
00:40:22.023 --> 00:40:22.856
MARISHA: Oh.

1186
00:40:22.856 --> 00:40:23.805
Just intelligence?

1187
00:40:23.805 --> 00:40:24.638
MATT: Yeah.

1188
00:40:25.513 --> 00:40:27.357
MARISHA: Wait, did you say saving throw or just--

1189
00:40:27.357 --> 00:40:28.485
MATT: Just a check.

1190
00:40:28.485 --> 00:40:30.847
TRAVIS: 15.

1191
00:40:30.847 --> 00:40:31.680
MARISHA: Oh god.

1192
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.896
Oh, no, that's good.

1193
00:40:33.896 --> 00:40:34.885
19.

1194
00:40:34.885 --> 00:40:35.783
MATT: 19, yeah.

1195
00:40:35.783 --> 00:40:36.616
Both looking at it,

1196
00:40:36.616 --> 00:40:37.923
you get the sense that

1197
00:40:37.923 --> 00:40:38.954
there's two paths there.

1198
00:40:38.954 --> 00:40:42.125
I mean, you can go around the outside path,

1199
00:40:42.125 --> 00:40:44.363
that's known as the Hollowed Path.

1200
00:40:44.363 --> 00:40:45.504
MARISHA: This thing?
MATT: Yep,

1201
00:40:45.504 --> 00:40:46.962
and take that to Bazzoxan,

1202
00:40:46.962 --> 00:40:49.005
and it will take you about five days' travel.

1203
00:40:49.005 --> 00:40:50.543
(whistles)

1204
00:40:50.543 --> 00:40:52.593
Or you can go straight through the Barbed Fields,

1205
00:40:52.593 --> 00:40:53.913
and it'll take you about three days' travel.

1206
00:40:53.913 --> 00:40:55.205
But it's up to you guys.

1207
00:40:55.205 --> 00:40:56.303
MARISHA: I'm assuming the Barbed Fields

1208
00:40:56.303 --> 00:40:58.773
is more deadly and less traveled.

1209
00:40:58.773 --> 00:41:00.693
TRAVIS: No, barbs represent--

1210
00:41:00.693 --> 00:41:02.250
MATT: The Barbed Fields was the ground zero

1211
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.908
for the final battles of the Calamity.

1212
00:41:03.908 --> 00:41:05.841
TRAVIS: Oh, we're definitely going through there!

1213
00:41:05.841 --> 00:41:07.382
MARISHA: Hell yeah! That sounds fucking awesome!

1214
00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:08.490
TRAVIS: Take me on that TMZ tour!

1215
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.915
MARISHA: Road trip! Yeah!

1216
00:41:11.456 --> 00:41:13.473
MATT: You have options.

1217
00:41:13.473 --> 00:41:14.306
TRAVIS: No.

1218
00:41:14.306 --> 00:41:15.853
There's no option there.

1219
00:41:15.853 --> 00:41:18.634
LAURA: Is that like entering into the level 20 zone, though?

1220
00:41:18.634 --> 00:41:19.674
TRAVIS: I don't care!

1221
00:41:19.674 --> 00:41:21.754
We are here!
MARISHA: Maruo.

1222
00:41:21.754 --> 00:41:22.815
The Barbed Zone.

1223
00:41:22.815 --> 00:41:24.375
Barbed Zone, is that what it is?

1224
00:41:24.375 --> 00:41:26.514
Is that what it's called?
LAURA: The Barbed Fields.

1225
00:41:26.514 --> 00:41:28.565
MARISHA: Oh. The Bone Zone.

1226
00:41:28.565 --> 00:41:29.605
MATT: "Wait, I don't--

1227
00:41:29.605 --> 00:41:31.323
"I'm not following this at all."

1228
00:41:31.323 --> 00:41:33.431
SAM: Do you watch Stranger Things?

1229
00:41:33.431 --> 00:41:35.263
MATT: "I've only seen half of the first season!"

1230
00:41:35.263 --> 00:41:38.843
(laughter)

1231
00:41:38.843 --> 00:41:41.954
TRAVIS: Have you ever been through the Barbed Fields?

1232
00:41:41.954 --> 00:41:43.271
MATT: "What? No!

1233
00:41:43.271 --> 00:41:44.751
"Why would you want to go there?

1234
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:45.863
"That place is--"

1235
00:41:45.863 --> 00:41:47.322
LAURA: Scary?

1236
00:41:47.322 --> 00:41:48.802
MARISHA: Yeah.

1237
00:41:48.802 --> 00:41:50.783
MATT: "You're not from around here, are you?"

1238
00:41:50.783 --> 00:41:51.674
TRAVIS: What gave us away?

1239
00:41:51.674 --> 00:41:54.042
LIAM: What can you tell us about the Barbed Fields?

1240
00:41:54.042 --> 00:41:55.264
MATT: "I haven't been there.

1241
00:41:55.264 --> 00:41:56.505
"I hear all these terrible stories

1242
00:41:56.505 --> 00:41:59.234
"and it's really terrible to get around.

1243
00:41:59.234 --> 00:42:00.666
"And it's hot during the day

1244
00:42:00.666 --> 00:42:02.714
"and there's all sorts of terrible creatures

1245
00:42:02.714 --> 00:42:05.466
"and weird errant magic that

1246
00:42:05.466 --> 00:42:06.805
"lingers from back when

1247
00:42:06.805 --> 00:42:11.026
"all the crazy-ass gods were fighting and shit and--

1248
00:42:11.026 --> 00:42:13.794
"I don't know, I just-- that's all I know!"

1249
00:42:13.794 --> 00:42:14.655
TRAVIS: Any groups in town

1250
00:42:14.655 --> 00:42:16.455
that regularly make their way out there

1251
00:42:16.455 --> 00:42:18.785
to scavenge for relics?

1252
00:42:18.785 --> 00:42:20.662
MATT: "None that I'd care to really know

1253
00:42:20.662 --> 00:42:22.765
"and few that come back, I'm sure."

1254
00:42:22.765 --> 00:42:24.203
TRAVIS: Yeah, all right.

1255
00:42:24.203 --> 00:42:25.823
MARISHA: What kind of creatures?

1256
00:42:25.823 --> 00:42:27.575
MATT: "I don't know, I haven't been there!"

1257
00:42:27.575 --> 00:42:28.614
SAM: (laughs) God!

1258
00:42:30.131 --> 00:42:33.456
TALIESIN: Maybe we talk to your doctor friend,

1259
00:42:34.615 --> 00:42:36.681
what's their name?

1260
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:38.098
TRAVIS: Professor Wacko.

1261
00:42:38.098 --> 00:42:39.498
ASHLEY: Professor Waccoh, yeah.

1262
00:42:39.498 --> 00:42:43.007
TALIESIN: Yeah, Professor-- I haven't actually even met them

1263
00:42:43.007 --> 00:42:45.090
to be fair. Yeah, Waccoh.

1264
00:42:46.378 --> 00:42:48.022
Maybe they could shed some light.

1265
00:42:48.022 --> 00:42:49.115
LIAM: I don't feel like talking to anyone,

1266
00:42:49.115 --> 00:42:51.277
I feel like getting out of town right away.

1267
00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:53.250
TRAVIS: That one. Let's do it.

1268
00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:54.839
LIAM: If we do, I don't want anything getting back--

1269
00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:56.774
LAURA: I could send a message to the Bright Queen and see.

1270
00:42:56.774 --> 00:42:58.326
SAM: No, no, no, no, no, don't,

1271
00:42:58.326 --> 00:42:59.786
she thought we were--

1272
00:42:59.786 --> 00:43:01.207
LIAM: Yeah, we were going to do this perfectly.

1273
00:43:01.207 --> 00:43:03.496
SAM: Do this awesome thing.

1274
00:43:03.496 --> 00:43:04.616
LIAM: Totally biffed it.

1275
00:43:04.616 --> 00:43:06.509
TRAVIS: Hey, DM, what the fuck

1276
00:43:06.509 --> 00:43:10.829
are these little doo-dads on the map there?

1277
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:13.428
MATT: That's a language you may not understand.

1278
00:43:13.428 --> 00:43:15.410
What languages do you know?

1279
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.730
TRAVIS: Definitely not doo-dad.

1280
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:18.563
Orc and Common.

1281
00:43:18.563 --> 00:43:19.718
MATT: Do you know Undercommon?

1282
00:43:19.718 --> 00:43:21.730
MARISHA: Ah, fuck, why didn't I take that?

1283
00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:22.930
TRAVIS: Anybody got Undercommon?

1284
00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:23.968
LIAM: No, but I can read anything

1285
00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.679
if you give me some time with it.

1286
00:43:25.679 --> 00:43:27.061
TALIESIN: Spanish or French is totally out for me.

1287
00:43:27.061 --> 00:43:27.894
LIAM: Book is out

1288
00:43:27.894 --> 00:43:29.664
and I'm starting to ritual cast Comprehend Languages.

1289
00:43:29.664 --> 00:43:31.494
MATT: You got it.
LAURA: How long does it take?

1290
00:43:31.494 --> 00:43:32.327
LIAM: Ten minutes.

1291
00:43:32.327 --> 00:43:33.589
ASHLEY: Does nobody speak some,

1292
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:34.919
nobody speaks Under, none of us--

1293
00:43:34.919 --> 00:43:36.690
TALIESIN: I don't think any of us would speak Undercommon.

1294
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:37.839
MATT: It's a 2nd-level spell--

1295
00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:39.582
no, it's a 1st-level spell, right?

1296
00:43:39.582 --> 00:43:40.749
LIAM: It's ritual.

1297
00:43:41.629 --> 00:43:43.412
ASHLEY: Pike spoke Undercommon.

1298
00:43:43.412 --> 00:43:44.245
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

1299
00:43:44.245 --> 00:43:45.829
ASHLEY: That doesn't help.

1300
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:48.799
SAM: Can she, you know, hologram in?

1301
00:43:48.799 --> 00:43:50.861
(laughter)

1302
00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:52.088
ASHLEY: (like Pike) Hey guys!

1303
00:43:52.088 --> 00:43:52.921
LIAM: It's level one?

1304
00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:55.129
MATT: Yes, level one, you're fine.

1305
00:43:55.129 --> 00:43:56.538
LIAM: One action, ten minutes.

1306
00:43:56.538 --> 00:43:57.371
SAM: Who the fuck is that?

1307
00:43:57.371 --> 00:43:58.617
LIAM: 11 minutes if I'm ritually casting.

1308
00:43:58.617 --> 00:44:00.769
MATT: You got it, all right.

1309
00:44:00.769 --> 00:44:01.940
You eventually look at it,

1310
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.031
and it says the Deepriver Mine.

1311
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:06.820
LIAM: Deepriver Mine. I will read everything

1312
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.052
that is in a different language.

1313
00:44:08.052 --> 00:44:10.081
There's a little bit up here as well.

1314
00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:14.031
MATT: That refers to the-- ah, let's see.

1315
00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:15.180
LAURA: Put it down, pull it down.

1316
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.763
MATT: That is the Ashguard Garrison.

1317
00:44:19.274 --> 00:44:20.432
LIAM: Here?

1318
00:44:20.432 --> 00:44:24.015
MATT: That is the-- let me pull up my map here, actually.

1319
00:44:24.015 --> 00:44:25.746
Now that we're doing this.

1320
00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:27.913
Now that we're doing this.

1321
00:44:29.357 --> 00:44:30.647
Hold on just a second.

1322
00:44:30.647 --> 00:44:32.064
Let me pull up my map.

1323
00:44:32.064 --> 00:44:33.584
MARISHA: Could we ruined it?

1324
00:44:33.584 --> 00:44:34.927
TRAVIS: Don't be writing on this shit!

1325
00:44:34.927 --> 00:44:36.094
Are you crazy?

1326
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:38.974
MARISHA: We want to remember.

1327
00:44:40.776 --> 00:44:41.869
TRAVIS: Damn dingle.

1328
00:44:41.869 --> 00:44:44.119
(laughter)

1329
00:44:44.989 --> 00:44:45.822
LIAM: You can write it,

1330
00:44:45.822 --> 00:44:47.765
you can write you a little map in your book.

1331
00:44:47.765 --> 00:44:49.326
MARISHA: No, that's the time--

1332
00:44:49.326 --> 00:44:50.557
MATT: That's called the Bloodwalk.

1333
00:44:50.557 --> 00:44:51.418
LIAM: Which one?

1334
00:44:51.418 --> 00:44:52.486
SAM: The Bloodwalk?

1335
00:44:52.486 --> 00:44:53.647
MATT: That one, right there, that leads

1336
00:44:53.647 --> 00:44:54.837
to the Ashguard Garrison.

1337
00:44:54.837 --> 00:44:56.429
LAURA: Ew, the Bloodwalk.

1338
00:44:56.429 --> 00:44:58.909
LIAM: Okay, we have a little more here.

1339
00:44:58.909 --> 00:45:00.492
And here.

1340
00:45:02.507 --> 00:45:05.007
MATT: Okay, that right there is--

1341
00:45:07.899 --> 00:45:09.186
There's Fevergulf Lake and then

1342
00:45:09.186 --> 00:45:11.986
those are the-- it reads as the Eyes of the Lake.

1343
00:45:11.986 --> 00:45:12.819
LIAM: Oh, good.

1344
00:45:12.819 --> 00:45:14.255
LAURA: Cool.

1345
00:45:14.255 --> 00:45:16.287
LIAM: Eyes of the Lake.

1346
00:45:16.287 --> 00:45:18.070
TRAVIS: You writing this down?

1347
00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.265
LAURA: No, nobody is!

1348
00:45:19.265 --> 00:45:20.439
SAM: Why aren't you writing this down?

1349
00:45:20.439 --> 00:45:22.114
MARISHA: To what end? I don't have reference!

1350
00:45:22.114 --> 00:45:24.790
Because we should just write it on the map.

1351
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.911
SAM: Post Its, we need Post Its.

1352
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:28.624
TALIESIN: That's a really good idea.

1353
00:45:28.624 --> 00:45:30.065
LIAM: Is this just flair?

1354
00:45:30.065 --> 00:45:31.870
MATT: That's just flair, yeah.

1355
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.091
TRAVIS: There was something mine.

1356
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:34.232
The Boneshatter Mine?

1357
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:35.065
MATT: The Deepriver Mine,

1358
00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:35.992
it's actually where you've already been.

1359
00:45:35.992 --> 00:45:40.764
That was where you had to go and free the giants from.

1360
00:45:40.764 --> 00:45:41.872
TALIESIN: I like the idea of Post Its.

1361
00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:43.490
MATT: It's your guys' map, you can do what you want with it.

1362
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.952
LIAM: We'll do it later when we can.

1363
00:45:44.952 --> 00:45:46.870
TRAVIS: We're not ruining that shit.

1364
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:47.727
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

1365
00:45:47.727 --> 00:45:50.538
LIAM: Eyes of the Lake, Blood Path.

1366
00:45:50.538 --> 00:45:51.371
TRAVIS: Bloodwalk.

1367
00:45:51.371 --> 00:45:55.310
LIAM: Bloodwalk, Universal City Bloodwalk.

1368
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.546
And this was what again?

1369
00:45:56.546 --> 00:45:57.379
TRAVIS: Deepriver Mine.

1370
00:45:57.379 --> 00:45:59.287
LIAM: Deepriver Mine, thanks.

1371
00:45:59.287 --> 00:46:01.128
TRAVIS: And is that one right here, too?

1372
00:46:01.128 --> 00:46:02.136
MATT: That is.

1373
00:46:03.066 --> 00:46:05.558
That reads "Charis."

1374
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:08.298
C-H-A-R-I-S.

1375
00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:10.266
LAURA: Ooh, I feel like that one had significant meaning.

1376
00:46:10.266 --> 00:46:12.574
LIAM: Does that name stand out in all of my reading?

1377
00:46:12.574 --> 00:46:14.824
MATT: Make a history check.
TRAVIS: Backwards it means sirahc!

1378
00:46:16.492 --> 00:46:17.483
ASHLEY: Charis.

1379
00:46:17.483 --> 00:46:18.540
LIAM: 26.

1380
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.140
ALL: Ooh!

1381
00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.890
MATT: No.
LIAM: Okay.

1382
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:23.380
ALL: Whoa!

1383
00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.530
TRAVIS: Oh shit, Charis!

1384
00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.804
LAURA: We got to go see what Charis is!

1385
00:46:28.804 --> 00:46:30.479
TRAVIS: (alarm sirens)

1386
00:46:30.479 --> 00:46:32.908
LIAM: Straight to the end game!

1387
00:46:32.908 --> 00:46:34.197
TRAVIS: (like a drum) Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

1388
00:46:34.197 --> 00:46:35.447
ASHLEY: Where was it?

1389
00:46:36.905 --> 00:46:38.037
LIAM: That's the dan-- that's the Bone Zone.

1390
00:46:38.037 --> 00:46:39.020
ASHLEY: This right here?

1391
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.629
LAURA and ASHLEY: That's the Bone Zone!

1392
00:46:41.629 --> 00:46:42.462
LIAM: Okay.

1393
00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:47.081
TRAVIS: Complete the other missions to unlock.

1394
00:46:47.081 --> 00:46:49.132
(laughter)

1395
00:46:49.132 --> 00:46:51.122
MARISHA: Why can't I?

1396
00:46:51.122 --> 00:46:52.572
MATT: You have very little information

1397
00:46:52.572 --> 00:46:55.634
about the Lotusden Greenwood.

1398
00:46:55.634 --> 00:46:58.924
It's considered a very, very dangerous forest,

1399
00:46:58.924 --> 00:47:02.932
that's all you recall about the vicinity.

1400
00:47:02.932 --> 00:47:05.154
Something about unbridled,

1401
00:47:05.154 --> 00:47:06.663
corrupted fae magic, and it's

1402
00:47:06.663 --> 00:47:07.822
this very dangerous forest

1403
00:47:07.822 --> 00:47:10.343
and you have no idea what Charis is.

1404
00:47:10.343 --> 00:47:11.451
TRAVIS: My god, I'm so amped right now,

1405
00:47:11.451 --> 00:47:13.914
can we please go to ground zero, can we please?

1406
00:47:13.914 --> 00:47:15.292
LAURA: I think we are going to ground zero.

1407
00:47:15.292 --> 00:47:17.034
TRAVIS: Let's go!
LAURA: We're going to the Barbed Fields.

1408
00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:18.052
TRAVIS: Expediently!

1409
00:47:18.052 --> 00:47:20.001
TALIESIN: Do we want to go fast

1410
00:47:20.001 --> 00:47:22.120
or do we want to maybe prepare a little bit?

1411
00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.749
SAM: No, we just have to go!

1412
00:47:23.749 --> 00:47:25.821
MATT: You gotta go fast.

1413
00:47:25.821 --> 00:47:26.654
Sorry.

1414
00:47:26.654 --> 00:47:27.590
I'm sorry.

1415
00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:28.578
I'm so sorry.

1416
00:47:28.578 --> 00:47:29.869
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1417
00:47:29.869 --> 00:47:31.319
You are forgiven.

1418
00:47:32.497 --> 00:47:34.231
SAM: We go get our moorbounders

1419
00:47:34.231 --> 00:47:36.579
and we try to make up lost ground on this fucker!

1420
00:47:36.579 --> 00:47:38.916
ASHLEY: Do you want to talk to these dead things?

1421
00:47:38.916 --> 00:47:41.413
LAURA: Oh right.
TALIESIN: We can take their heads.

1422
00:47:41.413 --> 00:47:42.312
ASHLEY: Or do we leave?

1423
00:47:42.312 --> 00:47:44.087
SAM: We can take their heads?

1424
00:47:44.087 --> 00:47:45.599
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.
SAM: That is dark!

1425
00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:46.530
TRAVIS: What?!

1426
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:47.746
MARISHA: That's a good idea. I'm into it.

1427
00:47:47.746 --> 00:47:48.580
ASHLEY: I go over to one.

1428
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.548
MARISHA: Yeah. I help Yasha behead the other.

1429
00:47:51.548 --> 00:47:52.538
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

1430
00:47:52.538 --> 00:47:53.371
Oh boy.

1431
00:47:54.935 --> 00:47:56.098
MATT: "Whoa!

1432
00:47:56.098 --> 00:47:57.752
"Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!"

1433
00:47:57.752 --> 00:48:00.556
TALIESIN: Here and now ain't the place for this!

1434
00:48:00.556 --> 00:48:03.013
MARISHA: Time is of the fucking essence, Caduceus!

1435
00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:06.296
MATT: "I don't know who you are,

1436
00:48:06.296 --> 00:48:09.247
"but that's going to take weeks to scrape out of the wood!

1437
00:48:09.247 --> 00:48:11.964
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (high-pitched) Whoa!

1438
00:48:11.964 --> 00:48:13.155
LIAM: Let me tell you something.

1439
00:48:13.155 --> 00:48:15.476
If you talk, that would be you.

1440
00:48:15.476 --> 00:48:16.309
Understood?

1441
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:18.159
MATT: "I understand it completely."

1442
00:48:18.159 --> 00:48:19.119
TALIESIN: See, now that's dark.

1443
00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:20.208
LAURA: We don't want to, though.

1444
00:48:20.208 --> 00:48:21.729
I don't want to do that to you.

1445
00:48:21.729 --> 00:48:23.198
MATT: "I'm getting a lot

1446
00:48:23.198 --> 00:48:26.755
"of weird mixed messages from you guys."

1447
00:48:26.755 --> 00:48:27.588
TRAVIS: If you play by the rules

1448
00:48:27.588 --> 00:48:29.113
and you don't get turned inside out

1449
00:48:29.113 --> 00:48:30.006
and your head cut off.

1450
00:48:30.006 --> 00:48:32.553
MATT: "You got it, no worries!" (laughs)

1451
00:48:32.553 --> 00:48:34.915
MARISHA: I take out 15 platinum

1452
00:48:34.915 --> 00:48:36.665
from the platinum that we scooped up.

1453
00:48:36.665 --> 00:48:38.614
LAURA: No! What are you do-- I mean.

1454
00:48:38.614 --> 00:48:40.947
TRAVIS: We already dropped out some gold, didn't we?

1455
00:48:40.947 --> 00:48:42.161
MARISHA: Did we give them gold?

1456
00:48:42.161 --> 00:48:44.111
TRAVIS: Yeah, we dropped off some gold, right?

1457
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:45.599
Didn't you, in your plan?

1458
00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:46.874
TALIESIN: I mentioned it,

1459
00:48:46.874 --> 00:48:49.690
I didn't actually get around to it.

1460
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:50.769
If I recall.

1461
00:48:50.769 --> 00:48:52.079
I don't know, maybe.

1462
00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:54.329
TRAVIS: (mumbling)

1463
00:48:55.821 --> 00:48:58.770
MARISHA: One gold is-- or one platinum is ten gold,

1464
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.734
right? So that's 150 gold?

1465
00:49:01.734 --> 00:49:02.671
SAM: Do your thing.

1466
00:49:02.671 --> 00:49:04.965
LIAM: How about half now and half when we get back.

1467
00:49:04.965 --> 00:49:05.812
MATT: (pained sound)

1468
00:49:05.812 --> 00:49:07.712
(laughter)

1469
00:49:07.712 --> 00:49:09.379
MARISHA: Long con achieved!

1470
00:49:12.955 --> 00:49:14.409
LIAM: How about some now--

1471
00:49:14.409 --> 00:49:16.879
TRAVIS: I'll aim it for the map!

1472
00:49:16.879 --> 00:49:17.861
MARISHA: You don't know when we're going to return.

1473
00:49:17.861 --> 00:49:18.694
LIAM: That's right.

1474
00:49:18.694 --> 00:49:21.708
MARISHA: Just take 150 gold,

1475
00:49:21.708 --> 00:49:23.528
take this 15 platinum

1476
00:49:23.528 --> 00:49:26.203
and let's consider

1477
00:49:27.717 --> 00:49:30.689
this a down payment on our membership

1478
00:49:30.689 --> 00:49:32.719
for whenever we want to use your facilities,

1479
00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:33.552
how does that sound?

1480
00:49:33.552 --> 00:49:34.896
SAM: Or this will happen to you!

1481
00:49:34.896 --> 00:49:37.388
MATT: "(screaming)"

1482
00:49:37.388 --> 00:49:39.409
LAURA: Also have a really good day, okay?

1483
00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:40.722
MATT: "Thanks!"

1484
00:49:40.722 --> 00:49:41.555
LAURA: We should go now.

1485
00:49:41.555 --> 00:49:43.564
MATT: "I read you loud and clear!

1486
00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:44.624
"Good day!"

1487
00:49:44.624 --> 00:49:48.415
ASHLEY: Wait, what was your bugbear's name?

1488
00:49:48.415 --> 00:49:49.415
I don't think we--

1489
00:49:49.415 --> 00:49:50.841
MATT: Oh, oh. (laughs)
ASHLEY: Did we get his name?

1490
00:49:50.841 --> 00:49:52.041
MATT: You got it last--

1491
00:49:52.041 --> 00:49:54.454
SAM: Frank or something, it was very basic.

1492
00:49:54.454 --> 00:49:55.593
TRAVIS: Ken.

1493
00:49:55.593 --> 00:49:57.920
MATT: Something very simple.

1494
00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.008
TALIESIN: My other notebook does not--

1495
00:49:59.008 --> 00:50:02.404
MATT: Yeah, I left my note for that. That's fine.

1496
00:50:02.404 --> 00:50:04.076
MARISHA: I split up the rest of the platinum

1497
00:50:04.076 --> 00:50:06.484
and I give everybody five platinum.

1498
00:50:06.484 --> 00:50:07.713
LAURA: (unimpressed) Oh.

1499
00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:09.048
I mean, thank you!

1500
00:50:10.131 --> 00:50:10.964
TALIESIN: Wow.

1501
00:50:10.964 --> 00:50:11.824
MARISHA: Your Vex is showing.

1502
00:50:11.824 --> 00:50:13.907
LAURA: (groans) [inaudble]

1503
00:50:16.338 --> 00:50:17.505
TALIESIN: It's a lot of platinum.

1504
00:50:18.455 --> 00:50:21.344
TRAVIS: All right, so we move with expedience

1505
00:50:21.344 --> 00:50:23.676
back towards the moorbounders.

1506
00:50:23.676 --> 00:50:26.426
MATT: All right, so you head back to the Xhorhouse.

1507
00:50:27.476 --> 00:50:31.267
Holding the severed heads of--

1508
00:50:31.267 --> 00:50:32.467
who?
TRAVIS: In the bag of holding.

1509
00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:35.250
MATT: Of which ones, of the dragonborn?

1510
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:36.341
SAM: And the bugbear.

1511
00:50:36.341 --> 00:50:38.131
MATT: Oh, and the hobgoblin, you mean?

1512
00:50:38.131 --> 00:50:38.980
LAURA: Yes.

1513
00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.879
SAM: No, the hobgoblin. You are totally right.

1514
00:50:41.879 --> 00:50:43.129
MATT: And the horse?

1515
00:50:43.129 --> 00:50:43.962
ALL: No.

1516
00:50:43.962 --> 00:50:44.901
MATT: Okay! (laughs)

1517
00:50:44.901 --> 00:50:46.673
TRAVIS: We have the hobgoblin's sword too, right?

1518
00:50:46.673 --> 00:50:48.224
LIAM: (blanket lifting) Aah!

1519
00:50:48.224 --> 00:50:49.443
Aah!

1520
00:50:49.443 --> 00:50:50.680
TRAVIS: He's got some kind of crazy sword, right?

1521
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.528
The hobgoblin did?

1522
00:50:51.528 --> 00:50:52.361
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1523
00:50:53.423 --> 00:50:55.600
TRAVIS: We haven't identified it or anything, right?

1524
00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.072
LAURA: Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1525
00:50:58.072 --> 00:50:59.283
No.

1526
00:50:59.283 --> 00:51:00.512
SAM: The moorbounders are back at where,

1527
00:51:00.512 --> 00:51:02.763
at our house, at the Xhorhouse?

1528
00:51:02.763 --> 00:51:04.533
MATT: The moorbounders are back at your house, yes.

1529
00:51:04.533 --> 00:51:06.415
TRAVIS: Hobgoblin.
ASHLEY: Hobgoblin sword?

1530
00:51:06.415 --> 00:51:07.390
TRAVIS: He had a dope-ass sword.

1531
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:08.682
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah, it did.

1532
00:51:08.682 --> 00:51:10.714
LAURA: Did you identify it? You didn't yet.

1533
00:51:10.714 --> 00:51:12.530
LIAM: A sword. Did you give me a sword?

1534
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:13.755
LAURA: The hobgoblin sword.

1535
00:51:13.755 --> 00:51:15.726
LIAM: It wasn't given to me to identify.

1536
00:51:15.726 --> 00:51:17.222
TRAVIS: Well, let's say we have it in the bag of holding,

1537
00:51:17.222 --> 00:51:18.064
but we haven't identified it.

1538
00:51:18.064 --> 00:51:18.897
LAURA: We'll take it back to the--

1539
00:51:18.897 --> 00:51:19.947
LIAM: Okay.

1540
00:51:19.947 --> 00:51:21.630
ASHLEY: I hadn't even thought about that.
MATT: It's all good

1541
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:22.925
All right, so you head back in the house,

1542
00:51:22.925 --> 00:51:26.685
you have the heads.

1543
00:51:26.685 --> 00:51:28.336
It seems that in the time you've been there,

1544
00:51:28.336 --> 00:51:29.365
you've managed to at least,

1545
00:51:29.365 --> 00:51:30.875
for the time being, dissipate most of

1546
00:51:30.875 --> 00:51:35.464
the dangerous interest of the events that transpired there.

1547
00:51:35.464 --> 00:51:39.395
You've made an arrangement with the goblin owner

1548
00:51:39.395 --> 00:51:40.728
of the Overcrow.

1549
00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:44.445
Hopefully things are okay for the time being.

1550
00:51:44.445 --> 00:51:45.278
With that knowledge,

1551
00:51:45.278 --> 00:51:48.150
you make your way back to the Xhorhouse.

1552
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:50.073
Your moorbounders are waiting,

1553
00:51:50.073 --> 00:51:51.653
they probably haven't been fed all morning,

1554
00:51:51.653 --> 00:51:52.851
since you guys were gone overnight,

1555
00:51:52.851 --> 00:51:53.875
they're all pacing.

1556
00:51:53.875 --> 00:51:55.458
LAURA: Yarnball!

1557
00:51:55.458 --> 00:51:57.100
We should have brought the horse.

1558
00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.325
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1559
00:51:58.325 --> 00:51:59.158
SAM: Well, when we're done with the heads

1560
00:51:59.158 --> 00:52:01.075
they can eat the heads.

1561
00:52:02.238 --> 00:52:03.071
TRAVIS: Oh wow.

1562
00:52:03.071 --> 00:52:03.904
MARISHA: That's true.

1563
00:52:03.904 --> 00:52:06.987
TRAVIS: Not a lot of meat on the heads.

1564
00:52:06.987 --> 00:52:07.820
MARISHA: Okay.

1565
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.305
SAM: Let's go talk to these heads.

1566
00:52:10.305 --> 00:52:11.865
In the happy room or the war room?

1567
00:52:11.865 --> 00:52:13.240
TALIESIN: We can't do it 'til tomorrow.

1568
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.273
SAM: We can't do it 'til tomorrow?

1569
00:52:15.273 --> 00:52:16.106
TRAVIS: We've got to travel.

1570
00:52:16.106 --> 00:52:17.833
MARISHA: Let's take the heads.

1571
00:52:17.833 --> 00:52:20.494
TALIESIN: That's why I even recommended it,

1572
00:52:20.494 --> 00:52:22.702
because this is definitely--

1573
00:52:22.702 --> 00:52:23.843
MARISHA: Let's take the heads and go.

1574
00:52:23.843 --> 00:52:24.996
TRAVIS: Saddle up, partners.

1575
00:52:24.996 --> 00:52:25.916
LAURA: All right.

1576
00:52:25.916 --> 00:52:28.374
MATT: All right, so you guys grab your equipment,

1577
00:52:28.374 --> 00:52:29.465
the things you need.

1578
00:52:29.465 --> 00:52:31.604
LAURA: Can we grab-- did we have food

1579
00:52:31.604 --> 00:52:34.574
for the moorbounders here at the house?

1580
00:52:34.574 --> 00:52:36.434
MATT: Have you purchased food for them?

1581
00:52:36.434 --> 00:52:37.908
LIAM: No, we should swing past Mauro's

1582
00:52:37.908 --> 00:52:39.548
on the way out of town and grab the horse

1583
00:52:39.548 --> 00:52:41.815
and take it with us.

1584
00:52:41.815 --> 00:52:43.377
LAURA: Okay.

1585
00:52:43.377 --> 00:52:44.210
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

1586
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:45.043
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1587
00:52:45.043 --> 00:52:45.896
LIAM: Okay.

1588
00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:49.566
MATT: Okay, so you mount up your moorbounders,

1589
00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:50.777
gather the things you need

1590
00:52:50.777 --> 00:52:53.034
and start tearing through

1591
00:52:53.034 --> 00:52:54.885
the north ends of the city

1592
00:52:54.885 --> 00:52:56.885
back through the various districts

1593
00:52:56.885 --> 00:52:58.038
outside the Gallimaufry,

1594
00:52:58.038 --> 00:53:00.049
into the Coronas, heading over towards

1595
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:01.980
the Overcrow Apothecary once more.

1596
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.180
(loud footsteps)

1597
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.030
Riding up in your moorbounders.

1598
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:07.401
You open the door, and inside Maruo and the bugbear

1599
00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:09.969
are in the process of trying to pull the horse's corpse

1600
00:53:09.969 --> 00:53:12.987
into the ditch and scraping the floor.

1601
00:53:12.987 --> 00:53:14.670
"Yeah, aah!"
LIAM: Yeah, actually--

1602
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:15.736
MATT: "You're back?"

1603
00:53:15.736 --> 00:53:17.166
LIAM: About that, we thought maybe we would

1604
00:53:17.166 --> 00:53:19.266
take this with us, so we save you some--

1605
00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:21.319
MATT: "Please, by all means."

1606
00:53:21.319 --> 00:53:23.338
SAM: What about the hobgoblin body, too?

1607
00:53:23.338 --> 00:53:25.530
They could eat that, too.

1608
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:27.338
LAURA: Yeah, Yarnball, feast up!

1609
00:53:27.338 --> 00:53:30.289
TRAVIS: Anybody got any experience with butchering bodies?

1610
00:53:30.289 --> 00:53:32.919
MATT: As you're saying this,

1611
00:53:32.919 --> 00:53:35.656
Jester's moorbounder's just-- (loud footsteps)

1612
00:53:35.656 --> 00:53:38.416
inside the building, the door frame

1613
00:53:38.416 --> 00:53:40.427
cracks as it pushes through.

1614
00:53:40.427 --> 00:53:42.767
Maruo's like, "Ugh!"

1615
00:53:42.767 --> 00:53:44.745
LAURA: Not that guy, only this stuff.

1616
00:53:44.745 --> 00:53:47.497
MATT: And hides behind the desk.
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

1617
00:53:47.497 --> 00:53:48.898
MATT: You hear, (bumping) against the wood.

1618
00:53:48.898 --> 00:53:52.066
The bugbear is now pressed up into the corner where he--

1619
00:53:52.066 --> 00:53:54.297
(panting)

1620
00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:56.086
Your moorbounder starts

1621
00:53:56.086 --> 00:53:58.646
tearing into the corpse of the hobgoblin, just--

1622
00:53:58.646 --> 00:54:02.563
(ripping and tearing)

1623
00:54:04.726 --> 00:54:07.584
LAURA: Save some for your brother and sister.

1624
00:54:07.584 --> 00:54:09.538
MATT: Spraying across the room.

1625
00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:11.788
(laughter)

1626
00:54:13.255 --> 00:54:14.588
LIAM: Is the ditch in the back of the house?

1627
00:54:14.588 --> 00:54:15.529
MATT: Yes.

1628
00:54:15.529 --> 00:54:17.205
LIAM: I'm going to take Jannik to the back

1629
00:54:17.205 --> 00:54:19.805
and start trying to hoist--

1630
00:54:19.805 --> 00:54:20.844
would you help me, please?

1631
00:54:20.844 --> 00:54:21.805
LAURA: Of course!

1632
00:54:21.805 --> 00:54:24.074
LIAM: Strong woman. And start hoisting the horse

1633
00:54:24.074 --> 00:54:25.634
onto the back of Jannik.

1634
00:54:25.634 --> 00:54:26.467
MATT: Okay.

1635
00:54:26.467 --> 00:54:27.643
LIAM: And tie him on.

1636
00:54:27.643 --> 00:54:28.476
MATT: All right.

1637
00:54:28.476 --> 00:54:30.253
LIAM: Later, later.

1638
00:54:30.253 --> 00:54:31.344
MATT: It takes a little bit of time,

1639
00:54:31.344 --> 00:54:32.763
because it is a horse,

1640
00:54:32.763 --> 00:54:33.643
and it is two of you.

1641
00:54:33.643 --> 00:54:35.660
You are very strong,

1642
00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.276
I'd say with a third person you could probably do it.

1643
00:54:37.276 --> 00:54:38.509
LAURA: Yasha!

1644
00:54:38.509 --> 00:54:39.342
ASHLEY: I will help.

1645
00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.175
MATT: Okay.

1646
00:54:40.175 --> 00:54:41.008
Between the three of you,

1647
00:54:41.008 --> 00:54:42.584
you're able to get the horse up onto the back,

1648
00:54:42.584 --> 00:54:44.275
tie it onto

1649
00:54:44.275 --> 00:54:47.025
the back of your moorbounder.
LAURA: Plus, he's lighter because--

1650
00:54:47.025 --> 00:54:48.840
never mind, he still has his head.

1651
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.040
Never mind, keep going.

1652
00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.112
MATT: (laughs)

1653
00:54:52.112 --> 00:54:54.181
It's a curious juggle of limbs and body parts

1654
00:54:54.181 --> 00:54:56.352
you guys have going in this recent session.

1655
00:54:56.352 --> 00:54:58.819
LIAM: I am just keeping Jannik calm

1656
00:54:58.819 --> 00:55:00.411
and keeping him from trying to eat

1657
00:55:00.411 --> 00:55:01.900
the creature now while these two strong women--

1658
00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.587
MATT: (panting)
LIAM: -- throw it over the saddle.

1659
00:55:04.587 --> 00:55:07.339
<i>Bitte, bis später</i>, okay?

1660
00:55:07.339 --> 00:55:08.632
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

1661
00:55:08.632 --> 00:55:09.718
LIAM: Yeah.

1662
00:55:10.651 --> 00:55:12.882
My streak going, no.

1663
00:55:12.882 --> 00:55:13.919
11.

1664
00:55:13.919 --> 00:55:14.752
MATT: 11.

1665
00:55:14.752 --> 00:55:17.200
(panting)

1666
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.760
Looks back at the horse and spins around

1667
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.709
and starts digging into the body of the horse.

1668
00:55:21.709 --> 00:55:23.678
LIAM: Okay, just a little bit right now.

1669
00:55:23.678 --> 00:55:24.511
Then--

1670
00:55:24.511 --> 00:55:28.274
(ripping and tearing)

1671
00:55:28.274 --> 00:55:30.030
Comes back, he has a big grin,

1672
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:33.302
big, toothy tusks. (groans)

1673
00:55:33.302 --> 00:55:36.331
LIAM: I can't stay mad at you. You're a good boy.

1674
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:38.696
MATT: (licking) Licks the side of you,

1675
00:55:38.696 --> 00:55:40.857
smears all the horse guts across your face.

1676
00:55:40.857 --> 00:55:42.107
ALL: Eww!

1677
00:55:42.107 --> 00:55:43.509
LIAM: I shouldn't love it, but I do.

1678
00:55:43.509 --> 00:55:46.087
(laughter)

1679
00:55:46.087 --> 00:55:48.029
MATT: Yeah, moorbounders are big.

1680
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:49.967
They are fast and they are useful,

1681
00:55:49.967 --> 00:55:53.339
they are also not inexpensive to keep fed.

1682
00:55:53.339 --> 00:55:55.248
Just things to keep in mind.

1683
00:55:55.248 --> 00:55:56.408
LIAM: Okay.

1684
00:55:56.408 --> 00:55:59.509
SAM: Do they have to eat every day?

1685
00:55:59.509 --> 00:56:00.342
MATT: Yeah.

1686
00:56:00.342 --> 00:56:01.550
LIAM: Just like us.

1687
00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:05.107
SAM: Oh, some animals can go a good day or two, you know.

1688
00:56:05.107 --> 00:56:09.552
TRAVIS: They get real hungry if they don't, though.

1689
00:56:09.552 --> 00:56:10.838
MATT: All right, so.

1690
00:56:10.838 --> 00:56:14.476
Leaving the moorbounders to finish their feast.

1691
00:56:14.476 --> 00:56:15.767
Do you want to take--

1692
00:56:15.767 --> 00:56:16.600
I think, between the three of them

1693
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.433
and how hungry they've been

1694
00:56:17.433 --> 00:56:18.478
for the past couple of days,

1695
00:56:18.478 --> 00:56:21.016
since you've been off doing business

1696
00:56:21.016 --> 00:56:22.398
and haven't been home,

1697
00:56:22.398 --> 00:56:25.865
there's not much left of either of the corpses. (laughs)

1698
00:56:25.865 --> 00:56:26.703
SAM: Great.
LAURA: Sweet.

1699
00:56:26.703 --> 00:56:27.536
MARISHA: Good.
LIAM: So they're feeding.

1700
00:56:27.536 --> 00:56:28.776
We just let them go to town

1701
00:56:28.776 --> 00:56:29.609
here in the back?

1702
00:56:29.609 --> 00:56:30.442
LAURA: While we're doing that,

1703
00:56:30.442 --> 00:56:32.016
maybe you can identify that sword?

1704
00:56:32.016 --> 00:56:34.758
LIAM: Sure, give it to me, please.

1705
00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:35.805
MATT: All right.

1706
00:56:35.805 --> 00:56:37.736
LIAM: Spellbook out.

1707
00:56:37.736 --> 00:56:38.638
MATT: I will give it to you at the break,

1708
00:56:38.638 --> 00:56:39.606
because I don't have it on me at the moment.

1709
00:56:39.606 --> 00:56:40.439
LIAM: Cool.

1710
00:56:40.439 --> 00:56:42.106
MATT: It's actually in the back room. I'll get it later on.

1711
00:56:42.106 --> 00:56:43.737
LIAM: I hope it's a hype sword.

1712
00:56:43.737 --> 00:56:45.078
MATT: (laughs) We can only hope

1713
00:56:45.078 --> 00:56:45.911
it can be as cool as--

1714
00:56:45.911 --> 00:56:46.744
ASHLEY: (screeching) Hey!

1715
00:56:46.744 --> 00:56:48.757
MATT: -- as the hype man sword.

1716
00:56:48.757 --> 00:56:50.346
TALIESIN: Sword of Ambivalence.

1717
00:56:50.346 --> 00:56:51.179
MATT: Indeed.
MARISHA: Meh.

1718
00:56:51.179 --> 00:56:52.012
MATT: All right.

1719
00:56:53.225 --> 00:56:54.058
So.

1720
00:56:55.295 --> 00:56:56.744
Picking up, back on the road,

1721
00:56:56.744 --> 00:57:00.676
you make your way to the exit wall of Rosohna.

1722
00:57:00.676 --> 00:57:04.259
Exit past the guards that waive you through

1723
00:57:05.175 --> 00:57:07.842
with your badges of the Bright Queen.

1724
00:57:09.146 --> 00:57:11.435
Making your way into the Ghostlands.

1725
00:57:11.435 --> 00:57:14.826
Now, at this point, it's early afternoon.

1726
00:57:14.826 --> 00:57:18.576
Since you guys began this fray late morning.

1727
00:57:20.487 --> 00:57:21.320
The travel back and forth

1728
00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.186
and getting everything ready--

1729
00:57:22.186 --> 00:57:25.215
so I'm thinking it's about 3:00 in the afternoon

1730
00:57:25.215 --> 00:57:27.527
as you exit into the Ghostlands.

1731
00:57:27.527 --> 00:57:28.934
Pushing forward,

1732
00:57:28.934 --> 00:57:30.506
passing by the ruins,

1733
00:57:30.506 --> 00:57:32.535
low fog still hangs throughout

1734
00:57:32.535 --> 00:57:37.535
these desolate plains that surround the city.

1735
00:57:37.745 --> 00:57:39.887
Until eventually,

1736
00:57:39.887 --> 00:57:42.195
it goes from pitch black night

1737
00:57:42.195 --> 00:57:45.276
as it's been to

1738
00:57:45.276 --> 00:57:47.425
midday brightness, hot sun on you.

1739
00:57:47.425 --> 00:57:51.437
You escape from the radius of the enchantment

1740
00:57:51.437 --> 00:57:52.726
that holds eternal night

1741
00:57:52.726 --> 00:57:54.946
over the capitol of the Dynasty

1742
00:57:54.946 --> 00:57:58.466
into a clouded sky that is broken in spots,

1743
00:57:58.466 --> 00:58:00.135
and you can see there are beams of light

1744
00:58:00.135 --> 00:58:02.565
that come down, these

1745
00:58:02.565 --> 00:58:06.047
gold-speckled sun rays that peek through,

1746
00:58:06.047 --> 00:58:08.469
which is both beautiful and strangely ominous

1747
00:58:08.469 --> 00:58:10.538
as you look beyond the Ghostlands

1748
00:58:10.538 --> 00:58:13.599
towards the gray and red tint

1749
00:58:13.599 --> 00:58:15.618
of the Barbed Fields.

1750
00:58:15.618 --> 00:58:17.349
The rest of the day's travel,

1751
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:21.130
before the proper sunset comes around.

1752
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:22.538
It is nice to see a sunset,

1753
00:58:22.538 --> 00:58:24.458
as it's been since your

1754
00:58:24.458 --> 00:58:27.538
journey out to the mine since you've seen one.

1755
00:58:27.538 --> 00:58:31.727
You make it beyond the boundaries of the Ghostlands,

1756
00:58:31.727 --> 00:58:33.349
and just on the cusp

1757
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:35.067
of where the Barbed Fields begin.

1758
00:58:35.067 --> 00:58:37.245
You're at the point where the Hallowed Path

1759
00:58:37.245 --> 00:58:41.368
makes its way around the both sides of the valley.

1760
00:58:41.368 --> 00:58:42.308
Then looking forward,

1761
00:58:42.308 --> 00:58:45.928
you can see barren trees,

1762
00:58:45.928 --> 00:58:50.928
their branches gnarled and twisted, leafless.

1763
00:58:51.168 --> 00:58:53.288
You can see large portions

1764
00:58:53.288 --> 00:58:55.189
of the ground that have been

1765
00:58:55.189 --> 00:58:57.649
pressed up into jagged stonework

1766
00:58:57.649 --> 00:59:00.198
from heavy impacts from long ago.

1767
00:59:00.198 --> 00:59:03.040
You can see heavy, dark puddles

1768
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.189
where rainwater has seeped in over time

1769
00:59:05.189 --> 00:59:07.106
to create these

1770
00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:10.931
awful oil-slick puddles

1771
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:13.939
that occasionally bubble.

1772
00:59:15.129 --> 00:59:17.379
Most of the ground here

1773
00:59:18.469 --> 00:59:21.052
from the recent rain appears cracked,

1774
00:59:21.052 --> 00:59:25.194
as if it was a dusty, desert floor

1775
00:59:25.194 --> 00:59:27.936
that suddenly began to break

1776
00:59:27.936 --> 00:59:30.182
in one-inch increments in a long sheet.

1777
00:59:30.182 --> 00:59:34.515
It's this textured, broken surface

1778
00:59:34.515 --> 00:59:39.332
of varying brown, red, ruddy color.

1779
00:59:41.091 --> 00:59:41.974
MARISHA: Question.
MATT: Yes.

1780
00:59:41.974 --> 00:59:43.590
MARISHA: While we're traveling,

1781
00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:45.043
can I take a short rest

1782
00:59:45.043 --> 00:59:47.710
on the back of the moorbounders?

1783
00:59:49.223 --> 00:59:51.652
MATT: I'd say, to take a real rest--

1784
00:59:51.652 --> 00:59:54.674
You're either riding the moorbounder forward

1785
00:59:54.674 --> 00:59:55.872
at the speed you're wanting to get there

1786
00:59:55.872 --> 00:59:57.624
as fast as possible,

1787
00:59:57.624 --> 00:59:59.984
which is both active for you and the moorbounder,

1788
00:59:59.984 --> 01:00:02.433
or stopping and taking a short rest as a

1789
01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:05.567
sit on the ground, drink your water.

1790
01:00:05.567 --> 01:00:06.817
Or you can take this moorbounder

1791
01:00:06.817 --> 01:00:08.127
at a slower pace for an hour,

1792
01:00:08.127 --> 01:00:09.158
which will take some time.

1793
01:00:09.158 --> 01:00:10.687
MARISHA: I'll be fine.

1794
01:00:10.687 --> 01:00:12.039
TALIESIN: We're going to have to sleep eventually.

1795
01:00:12.039 --> 01:00:13.654
MARISHA: I'll be fine.

1796
01:00:13.654 --> 01:00:15.570
LIAM: I have a question as well.

1797
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.870
Either during this day of travel,

1798
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:20.028
or in the last 30, according to my Keen Mind,

1799
01:00:20.028 --> 01:00:23.268
have I seen any kinds of birds in this land?

1800
01:00:23.268 --> 01:00:25.199
MATT: Yeah, you've seen a few birds.

1801
01:00:25.199 --> 01:00:27.683
Mostly once you've left the city.

1802
01:00:27.683 --> 01:00:29.276
There are some that stay in there,

1803
01:00:29.276 --> 01:00:31.767
but there are darker birds.

1804
01:00:31.767 --> 01:00:33.858
LIAM: Not out here, outside the city.

1805
01:00:33.858 --> 01:00:37.548
MATT: Outside of the city, in the Ghostlands, not many.

1806
01:00:37.548 --> 01:00:40.788
In the Vermaloc, you saw many birds.

1807
01:00:40.788 --> 01:00:44.967
There's a vibrant ecological system

1808
01:00:44.967 --> 01:00:46.175
that lives in that forest.

1809
01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:47.596
LIAM: Are there any crows?

1810
01:00:47.596 --> 01:00:49.846
MATT: Crows, ravens,

1811
01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:52.596
all sorts of sparrows and other birds

1812
01:00:52.596 --> 01:00:54.258
that call the land home.

1813
01:00:54.258 --> 01:00:56.314
At this edge, from the Ghostlands

1814
01:00:56.314 --> 01:00:59.367
to the Barbed Fields, very few, if any.

1815
01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:00.228
The ones you have seen

1816
01:01:00.228 --> 01:01:04.853
tend to be larger birds of prey or scavengers.

1817
01:01:05.786 --> 01:01:06.778
LIAM: Okay.

1818
01:01:06.778 --> 01:01:07.887
MATT: And even they're pretty sparse.

1819
01:01:07.887 --> 01:01:08.887
LIAM: Thank you.

1820
01:01:09.795 --> 01:01:10.836
MARISHA: Is there any other wildlife

1821
01:01:10.836 --> 01:01:12.748
or creatures roaming that we see,

1822
01:01:12.748 --> 01:01:14.556
any other threats?

1823
01:01:14.556 --> 01:01:17.356
MATT: Make a perception check.

1824
01:01:19.156 --> 01:01:20.739
MARISHA: That's not great.

1825
01:01:21.632 --> 01:01:22.696
Ten.

1826
01:01:22.696 --> 01:01:24.028
MATT: Ten?

1827
01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:24.876
I mean, looking around,

1828
01:01:24.876 --> 01:01:28.875
you see insects that crawl amongst the muck

1829
01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:32.668
and the currently dried and cracked surface

1830
01:01:32.668 --> 01:01:35.468
of the edge of the fields.

1831
01:01:36.436 --> 01:01:38.727
Occasionally, you see what looks like an armadillo,

1832
01:01:38.727 --> 01:01:43.319
but the back of its folded, plated hide has these spines

1833
01:01:43.319 --> 01:01:44.338
that stick out the side.

1834
01:01:44.338 --> 01:01:46.405
It crawls its way across

1835
01:01:46.405 --> 01:01:48.207
before crawling under a rock

1836
01:01:48.207 --> 01:01:50.927
to get out of one of the hot points of sunbeam

1837
01:01:50.927 --> 01:01:53.095
that are now slowly pushing through this region,

1838
01:01:53.095 --> 01:01:57.695
and slowly baking that area of the field edge

1839
01:01:57.695 --> 01:01:59.372
as it cruises across.

1840
01:01:59.372 --> 01:02:00.716
TRAVIS: Totally Chernobyl.

1841
01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:02.397
MARISHA: Yeah.

1842
01:02:02.397 --> 01:02:03.980
ASHLEY: Is there anything

1843
01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:07.285
that I would know or any stories

1844
01:02:07.285 --> 01:02:10.207
that I've heard about the Barbed Fields?

1845
01:02:10.207 --> 01:02:11.396
MATT: Make a history check.

1846
01:02:11.396 --> 01:02:12.428
SAM: Come on, Yashy!

1847
01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:14.011
ASHLEY: Come on, come on.

1848
01:02:16.806 --> 01:02:17.656
16.

1849
01:02:17.656 --> 01:02:18.856
MATT: 16, okay.

1850
01:02:20.846 --> 01:02:22.179
What you know is

1851
01:02:23.417 --> 01:02:27.388
it's considered by some people

1852
01:02:27.388 --> 01:02:28.967
on the northern side of Xhorhas

1853
01:02:28.967 --> 01:02:30.799
as sacred territory.

1854
01:02:30.799 --> 01:02:32.006
Sacred in the sense that

1855
01:02:32.006 --> 01:02:33.158
it has a lot of meaning.

1856
01:02:33.158 --> 01:02:34.988
It was a place where

1857
01:02:34.988 --> 01:02:37.618
the final battles of the Calamity happened.

1858
01:02:37.618 --> 01:02:39.658
Those who watched,

1859
01:02:39.658 --> 01:02:43.079
who were either ostracized

1860
01:02:43.079 --> 01:02:46.717
or given severe judgment by their clan

1861
01:02:46.717 --> 01:02:48.137
or by some of the cities

1862
01:02:48.137 --> 01:02:49.879
before the Dynasty got involved

1863
01:02:49.879 --> 01:02:51.628
in their day-to-day life,

1864
01:02:51.628 --> 01:02:53.777
would be sent to the fields to survive

1865
01:02:53.777 --> 01:02:55.858
as a means of proving themselves

1866
01:02:55.858 --> 01:02:58.176
and possibly working through the

1867
01:02:58.176 --> 01:03:01.159
infractions that were perceived.

1868
01:03:01.159 --> 01:03:03.077
Not many came back,

1869
01:03:03.077 --> 01:03:04.978
most that did usually spoke of it

1870
01:03:04.978 --> 01:03:09.494
being a hellscape of survival where,

1871
01:03:12.487 --> 01:03:15.096
you know, nightmares walk the earth at night.

1872
01:03:15.096 --> 01:03:18.458
Large roving beasts and udaaks

1873
01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:21.875
occasionally go out to hunt and scavenge

1874
01:03:23.588 --> 01:03:26.399
as well as other things that linger

1875
01:03:26.399 --> 01:03:28.228
from those days,

1876
01:03:28.228 --> 01:03:30.687
entities from planes parallel to this

1877
01:03:30.687 --> 01:03:33.639
that seem to either pop through

1878
01:03:33.639 --> 01:03:35.738
or still remain, hunting

1879
01:03:35.738 --> 01:03:38.707
for whatever sense of life they can come across.

1880
01:03:38.707 --> 01:03:40.967
People also try and cut corners,

1881
01:03:40.967 --> 01:03:45.027
especially messengers or folks that are looking

1882
01:03:45.027 --> 01:03:48.399
to stay out of the eyeline of the Dynasty

1883
01:03:48.399 --> 01:03:51.066
and outside of its laws as well.

1884
01:03:52.988 --> 01:03:55.238
Nomads, people that wish to

1885
01:03:59.199 --> 01:04:02.628
rob folks who use the exterior highway

1886
01:04:02.628 --> 01:04:04.999
will usually stay amongst the perimeter

1887
01:04:04.999 --> 01:04:07.199
or on the outskirts of the fields

1888
01:04:07.199 --> 01:04:09.268
where few dare to follow them

1889
01:04:09.268 --> 01:04:11.837
to arrest them or hunt them down.

1890
01:04:11.837 --> 01:04:14.062
Only the toughest bounty hunters usually

1891
01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:16.229
will want to go deep enough into the Barbed Fields.

1892
01:04:17.202 --> 01:04:18.035
ASHLEY: Wow.

1893
01:04:19.382 --> 01:04:20.390
TRAVIS: (whispers) That's us.

1894
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:21.515
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

1895
01:04:21.515 --> 01:04:22.598
MATT: Apparently.

1896
01:04:23.835 --> 01:04:24.974
ASHLEY: I relay some of this information

1897
01:04:24.974 --> 01:04:26.974
to you guys on our ride.

1898
01:04:29.774 --> 01:04:32.104
TRAVIS: I feel good about our choices.

1899
01:04:32.104 --> 01:04:34.355
LAURA: You think we'll be okay in here?

1900
01:04:34.355 --> 01:04:35.746
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1901
01:04:36.675 --> 01:04:38.574
Don't do anything to attract attention,

1902
01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:40.515
we'll keep a low profile.

1903
01:04:40.515 --> 01:04:42.174
We'll be fine.

1904
01:04:42.174 --> 01:04:43.007
LAURA: Okay.

1905
01:04:43.007 --> 01:04:45.174
MARISHA: Have you seen our posse?

1906
01:04:46.035 --> 01:04:47.993
Look at us.
ASHLEY: We're not very low profile.

1907
01:04:47.993 --> 01:04:49.810
MARISHA: We roll deep.
TALIESIN: Practically the opposite.

1908
01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:51.664
SAM: There's nothing around here, though.

1909
01:04:51.664 --> 01:04:54.203
MARISHA: Exactly.

1910
01:04:54.203 --> 01:04:56.434
TALIESIN: Makes you stick out, doesn't it?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1911
01:04:56.434 --> 01:05:00.031
SAM: Yeah, but nothing's here to see us.

1912
01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:01.707
TALIESIN: Well...
MARISHA: Currently.

1913
01:05:01.707 --> 01:05:02.540
SAM: Yeah.

1914
01:05:03.544 --> 01:05:04.377
MARISHA: Wow.

1915
01:05:04.377 --> 01:05:05.392
LIAM: Yes, well, we do not need to worry

1916
01:05:05.392 --> 01:05:08.323
about diplomacy, just survival.

1917
01:05:08.323 --> 01:05:09.264
MARISHA: This is the most optimistic

1918
01:05:09.264 --> 01:05:11.094
I've seen you in a long time, Nott.

1919
01:05:11.094 --> 01:05:12.134
SAM: I'm real drunk.

1920
01:05:12.134 --> 01:05:12.967
MARISHA: Ah.

1921
01:05:12.967 --> 01:05:15.801
LAURA: Oh, Nott!

1922
01:05:15.801 --> 01:05:17.824
MARISHA: How long were you dry?

1923
01:05:17.824 --> 01:05:18.904
SAM: A few days.

1924
01:05:18.904 --> 01:05:20.152
MARISHA: Wow, that's pretty good for you.

1925
01:05:20.152 --> 01:05:21.944
SAM: Or a few weeks, I can't remember.

1926
01:05:21.944 --> 01:05:23.080
MARISHA: I think it was just a few days.

1927
01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.274
ASHLEY: Is it something you were trying to do or,

1928
01:05:26.274 --> 01:05:28.734
you were trying to not drink?

1929
01:05:28.734 --> 01:05:33.734
SAM: Just seems not, no, I don't know, I guess so, yeah.

1930
01:05:35.075 --> 01:05:35.908
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

1931
01:05:35.908 --> 01:05:38.372
LIAM: What do you think now, better, worse?

1932
01:05:38.372 --> 01:05:39.424
SAM: Better.

1933
01:05:39.424 --> 01:05:40.734
(groaning)

1934
01:05:40.734 --> 01:05:42.614
TRAVIS: Not as scared?

1935
01:05:42.614 --> 01:05:43.447
SAM: Let's go.

1936
01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:46.537
TRAVIS: All right.

1937
01:05:46.537 --> 01:05:47.370
MATT: Okay.

1938
01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:48.652
As the sun is setting,

1939
01:05:48.652 --> 01:05:51.250
are you guys heading into the Barbed Fields for a bit?

1940
01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:52.083
TRAVIS: Hell yeah.

1941
01:05:52.083 --> 01:05:53.637
LAURA: Right as the sun is setting.

1942
01:05:53.637 --> 01:05:54.928
Yeah, sounds fine!

1943
01:05:54.928 --> 01:05:55.761
MATT: Okay.

1944
01:05:57.033 --> 01:05:59.820
As you begin leaping your way

1945
01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.793
towards the center of the fields--

1946
01:06:01.793 --> 01:06:02.626
LIAM: Hold on a minute.

1947
01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.292
Do you want to tell the others you want to stop?

1948
01:06:04.292 --> 01:06:05.875
MARISHA: I'm fine.

1949
01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:09.013
As I, like, clutch a broken rib.

1950
01:06:09.013 --> 01:06:12.254
LIAM: You know, I'm not feeling so well.

1951
01:06:12.254 --> 01:06:13.087
SAM: Oh no!

1952
01:06:13.087 --> 01:06:14.814
LIAM: I think I might need to rest here.

1953
01:06:14.814 --> 01:06:15.905
SAM: Okay, let's all stop.

1954
01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:17.204
LIAM: I fell.

1955
01:06:17.204 --> 01:06:18.037
LAURA: You did?

1956
01:06:18.037 --> 01:06:19.712
Was it when I fell on you?

1957
01:06:19.712 --> 01:06:21.345
LIAM: Yes, but it's not your fault, I'm very--

1958
01:06:21.345 --> 01:06:23.553
LAURA: I didn't know you were so weak!

1959
01:06:23.553 --> 01:06:24.793
LIAM: You didn't?

1960
01:06:24.793 --> 01:06:26.751
LAURA: Yes, I did. I know you're weak.

1961
01:06:26.751 --> 01:06:28.183
I'm sorry I jumped on you.

1962
01:06:28.183 --> 01:06:29.374
LIAM: My apologies.

1963
01:06:29.374 --> 01:06:31.513
Would it be okay if we stopped here?

1964
01:06:31.513 --> 01:06:33.111
TALIESIN: I think that's probably a good idea.

1965
01:06:33.111 --> 01:06:34.402
LAURA: Of course, Caleb.

1966
01:06:34.402 --> 01:06:35.602
If that's what you need.

1967
01:06:35.602 --> 01:06:39.082
LIAM: We will rest as short a time as possible

1968
01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:41.293
and head out as early as possible

1969
01:06:41.293 --> 01:06:42.350
and maybe not go through there

1970
01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:45.031
in the middle of the, what time is it now?

1971
01:06:45.031 --> 01:06:48.893
MATT: At this point, it's about 7:30, 8:00.

1972
01:06:48.893 --> 01:06:50.351
LIAM: That late, maybe we don't want to go through there

1973
01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:52.751
for the first time in the middle of the night.

1974
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:53.711
I'm sorry.

1975
01:06:53.711 --> 01:06:55.094
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can lock it down here

1976
01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:56.427
and leave at first light.

1977
01:06:56.427 --> 01:06:59.181
LAURA: Sure. Can you build your dome?

1978
01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.256
LIAM: Absolutely.

1979
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:03.903
MARISHA: As they start the dome,

1980
01:07:03.903 --> 01:07:05.562
and I get off the back of Jannik,

1981
01:07:05.562 --> 01:07:08.234
and say: Man, you made

1982
01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:10.373
vulnerability look so easy.

1983
01:07:10.373 --> 01:07:11.453
LIAM: It is.

1984
01:07:13.183 --> 01:07:15.474
SAM: Is there any way to tie up our moorbounders?

1985
01:07:15.474 --> 01:07:18.000
Is there any-- are there trees?

1986
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.802
MATT: Yeah, there are, like a little ways into the field,

1987
01:07:20.802 --> 01:07:22.272
you know, a quarter mile or so,

1988
01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:24.242
you can see some trees.

1989
01:07:24.242 --> 01:07:25.373
TALIESIN: Something with a little cover.

1990
01:07:25.373 --> 01:07:27.914
SAM: Or we can just let them roam and hunt and come back.

1991
01:07:27.914 --> 01:07:29.173
TALIESIN: And maybe come back.

1992
01:07:29.173 --> 01:07:31.717
TRAVIS: Oh shit!
MATT: ♪ Maybe come back! ♪

1993
01:07:31.717 --> 01:07:33.806
MARISHA and SAM: ♪ Maybe come back. ♪

1994
01:07:33.806 --> 01:07:35.072
LIAM: Come back, Shane!

1995
01:07:35.072 --> 01:07:37.957
SAM: They usually come back.

1996
01:07:37.957 --> 01:07:39.410
TRAVIS: Yeah, unless they get eaten,

1997
01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:41.621
I think is the back part of that sentence.

1998
01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:42.741
TRAVIS: Unless they get eaten.

1999
01:07:42.741 --> 01:07:43.574
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2000
01:07:43.574 --> 01:07:44.690
SAM: Oh, you're worried about them!

2001
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:45.523
LIAM: Yeah!

2002
01:07:45.523 --> 01:07:46.356
SAM: Oh boy.

2003
01:07:46.356 --> 01:07:50.651
TRAVIS: I mean, unless we're there to keep them safe, huh?

2004
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:51.941
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to burn a little bit

2005
01:07:51.941 --> 01:07:55.861
on Gentle Repose, just to keep the heads from

2006
01:07:55.861 --> 01:07:57.919
getting weird on us.
MATT: Fair enough.

2007
01:07:57.919 --> 01:07:58.754
MARISHA: What does that do?

2008
01:07:58.754 --> 01:08:00.504
MATT: "Just to keep the heads from getting weird."

2009
01:08:00.504 --> 01:08:02.472
Taliesin Jaffe, 2019.

2010
01:08:02.472 --> 01:08:03.911
TRAVIS: Like melty or?

2011
01:08:03.911 --> 01:08:05.426
TALIESIN: Like melty.

2012
01:08:05.426 --> 01:08:07.254
LIAM: It's just like that Hellboy short story.

2013
01:08:07.254 --> 01:08:08.087
LIAM: Heads. Heads!
TRAVIS: So we start asking

2014
01:08:08.087 --> 01:08:09.402
these questions, they're not like

2015
01:08:09.402 --> 01:08:12.900
(mumbles incoherently)

2016
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.900
TALIESIN: (mumbles incoherently) of the Sicilian fields.

2017
01:08:19.186 --> 01:08:20.769
LIAM: Before bed, I would do dome,

2018
01:08:20.769 --> 01:08:23.551
the wire, Frumpkin sitting on top of the dome,

2019
01:08:23.551 --> 01:08:26.431
and then also I will use some incense

2020
01:08:26.431 --> 01:08:31.389
to resummon Frumpkin as-- would you allow me a vulture?

2021
01:08:31.389 --> 01:08:33.341
Or is that too much?

2022
01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:34.674
MATT: What is the...

2023
01:08:36.971 --> 01:08:39.631
LIAM: If not, I will go crow.

2024
01:08:39.631 --> 01:08:41.766
MATT: I don't think it'd be an issue, let me double check.

2025
01:08:41.766 --> 01:08:44.562
LIAM: It'd be a small vulture.

2026
01:08:44.562 --> 01:08:46.522
MARISHA: Little sickly vulture.

2027
01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.771
MATT: I don't think it would be a problem,

2028
01:08:48.771 --> 01:08:51.188
but let's go ahead and check.

2029
01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:54.127
LIAM: Challenge zero.

2030
01:08:55.133 --> 01:08:56.883
MATT: Oh yeah, it's fine.

2031
01:08:58.584 --> 01:08:59.853
Yeah, you can do that.

2032
01:08:59.853 --> 01:09:02.020
LIAM: Okay, one dirty vulture.

2033
01:09:03.951 --> 01:09:05.431
Sitting on the dome.

2034
01:09:05.431 --> 01:09:06.573
MATT: You've got it.

2035
01:09:06.573 --> 01:09:07.419
TALIESIN: Caw caw.

2036
01:09:07.419 --> 01:09:08.252
MATT: So.

2037
01:09:09.762 --> 01:09:12.122
As you guys prep to bed down for the night,

2038
01:09:12.122 --> 01:09:12.955
is anyone keeping watch,

2039
01:09:12.955 --> 01:09:14.023
or are you feeling comfy under the dome

2040
01:09:14.023 --> 01:09:17.591
and everyone's taking a long rest together?

2041
01:09:17.591 --> 01:09:18.681
MARISHA: We're under the dome.

2042
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:20.923
TALIESIN: The wire, I'm feeling--

2043
01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:22.818
TRAVIS: And a dome. I'm feeling good.

2044
01:09:22.818 --> 01:09:24.683
TALIESIN: We're in the dome.

2045
01:09:24.683 --> 01:09:27.405
LIAM: Frumpkin will wake me up

2046
01:09:27.405 --> 01:09:29.331
if anything bad happens.

2047
01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:30.664
MATT: You've got it.

2048
01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:33.274
(vulture caw)

2049
01:09:33.274 --> 01:09:35.253
Frumpkin's up on top,

2050
01:09:35.253 --> 01:09:37.975
getting used to the new form.

2051
01:09:37.975 --> 01:09:41.055
All right, you guys go to sleep.

2052
01:09:41.055 --> 01:09:44.106
You complete your long rest

2053
01:09:44.106 --> 01:09:45.689
without much issue.

2054
01:09:46.645 --> 01:09:49.274
You wake up with the morning light,

2055
01:09:49.274 --> 01:09:51.457
another welcome sight, as it's been a little while

2056
01:09:51.457 --> 01:09:53.705
since you've seen the dawn.

2057
01:09:54.834 --> 01:09:57.055
LAURA: (whispering) Should I have messaged anyone?

2058
01:09:57.055 --> 01:10:00.272
MATT: Strangely muggy, warm morning.

2059
01:10:01.623 --> 01:10:03.574
The clouds of the recent storm have broken a bit,

2060
01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.794
and you're seeing a bit of the actual

2061
01:10:05.794 --> 01:10:08.863
blue sky peeking through.

2062
01:10:08.863 --> 01:10:11.535
It's a little uncomfortable at the moment,

2063
01:10:11.535 --> 01:10:13.935
just from the morning heat as it comes down

2064
01:10:13.935 --> 01:10:17.768
unfiltered onto the baked floor of the fields.

2065
01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:21.393
You also get a good view

2066
01:10:21.393 --> 01:10:22.423
as the sun crests across.

2067
01:10:22.423 --> 01:10:25.131
You can see in the distance these large,

2068
01:10:26.274 --> 01:10:30.813
pointed spires that litter the distance across,

2069
01:10:30.813 --> 01:10:33.051
and you get a sense this might be

2070
01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:35.013
where some of the name comes from.

2071
01:10:35.013 --> 01:10:40.013
There are large, rocky, hooked in some places,

2072
01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:42.836
pointed and straight in others,

2073
01:10:44.093 --> 01:10:47.392
shapes on the horizon of the field.

2074
01:10:47.392 --> 01:10:48.813
Too far to make out much detail.

2075
01:10:48.813 --> 01:10:51.914
You can barely see them across the horizon.

2076
01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:52.747
TRAVIS: Awesome.

2077
01:10:54.823 --> 01:10:56.990
How's everybody feeling?

2078
01:10:58.841 --> 01:10:59.674
MARISHA: Great.

2079
01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:03.520
SAM: Do you need to-- we're just going to go

2080
01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.653
straight to that town?

2081
01:11:04.653 --> 01:11:07.463
You don't have to message him again or anything?

2082
01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:08.296
LAURA: I mean...

2083
01:11:08.296 --> 01:11:10.583
TRAVIS: Unless you wanted to throw him off the scent.

2084
01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:13.493
Tell him, don't come back, you hear?

2085
01:11:13.493 --> 01:11:15.282
LAURA: Well, gee whiz, that would have been nice

2086
01:11:15.282 --> 01:11:16.813
for you guys to decide to do last night,

2087
01:11:16.813 --> 01:11:19.103
so we're not entering into this fucking day

2088
01:11:19.103 --> 01:11:20.173
with me down a spell.

2089
01:11:20.173 --> 01:11:23.623
SAM: Or we could message Maruo

2090
01:11:23.623 --> 01:11:27.735
and ask if anyone else showed up yesterday.

2091
01:11:27.735 --> 01:11:28.946
LAURA: Yeah, I'll be sure to do that

2092
01:11:28.946 --> 01:11:30.306
at the end of the day today

2093
01:11:30.306 --> 01:11:32.207
if I don't use up all my spells.

2094
01:11:32.207 --> 01:11:33.797
Gee whiz, you guys.

2095
01:11:33.797 --> 01:11:36.304
What if we need me for Revivify or something?

2096
01:11:36.304 --> 01:11:39.080
LIAM and ASHLEY: (like Napoleon Dynamite) Gosh!

2097
01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:39.913
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2098
01:11:39.913 --> 01:11:42.624
ASHLEY: (like Napoleon Dynamite) Tina, go get some ham!

2099
01:11:42.624 --> 01:11:44.335
LAURA: Use the spells at the end of the day!

2100
01:11:44.335 --> 01:11:46.026
TRAVIS: Okay, fine, end of the day.

2101
01:11:46.026 --> 01:11:47.415
LIAM: Caleb, give me your Notts!

2102
01:11:47.415 --> 01:11:49.634
MARISHA: -- I don't know.

2103
01:11:49.634 --> 01:11:52.269
TRAVIS: Are we talking to the heads this morning?

2104
01:11:52.269 --> 01:11:53.897
TALIESIN: At the end of the day.

2105
01:11:53.897 --> 01:11:56.065
SAM: At the end of the day?

2106
01:11:56.065 --> 01:11:57.026
TRAVIS: ♪ At the end of the day! ♪

2107
01:11:57.026 --> 01:11:58.405
LIAM: ♪ You're another head shorter! ♪

2108
01:11:58.405 --> 01:12:02.659
(laughter)

2109
01:12:02.659 --> 01:12:04.794
TALIESIN: Seems prudent to do it at the end of the day.

2110
01:12:04.794 --> 01:12:06.494
LAURA: But what if--
SAM: At the end of the day.

2111
01:12:06.494 --> 01:12:07.382
SAM: What if you use your spell

2112
01:12:07.382 --> 01:12:09.314
and then you can't do it at the end of the day, either?

2113
01:12:09.314 --> 01:12:11.263
TALIESIN: Well, if I use my spell, then I'm really glad

2114
01:12:11.263 --> 01:12:12.962
I didn't talk to them at the beginning of the day,

2115
01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:14.360
because we would have needed that spell

2116
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.442
to get to the point of which we were talking to them

2117
01:12:16.442 --> 01:12:17.423
at the end of the day.

2118
01:12:17.423 --> 01:12:18.562
ASHLEY: I start walking into the fields.

2119
01:12:18.562 --> 01:12:19.928
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll follow Yasha.

2120
01:12:19.928 --> 01:12:21.125
MARISHA: What if they have pertinent information

2121
01:12:21.125 --> 01:12:22.422
that might be good to know sooner--

2122
01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:23.375
TRAVIS: You guys keep talking,

2123
01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:24.966
we'll see y'all across the way.

2124
01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:26.383
MARISHA: Are you going to get on the moorbounders?

2125
01:12:26.383 --> 01:12:27.554
TRAVIS: No, we're just walking.

2126
01:12:27.554 --> 01:12:29.501
MARISHA: Okay, have fun walking.

2127
01:12:29.501 --> 01:12:30.335
SAM: What are you talking about?

2128
01:12:30.335 --> 01:12:31.855
ASHLEY: Maybe we should actually, because--

2129
01:12:31.855 --> 01:12:33.455
TRAVIS: Maybe we'll get back on them.

2130
01:12:33.455 --> 01:12:35.426
TALIESIN: I'm still picking my spells for the day, anyway.

2131
01:12:35.426 --> 01:12:37.666
LAURA: I know, me too.

2132
01:12:37.666 --> 01:12:40.407
MARISHA: I do some push ups to make myself feel useful.

2133
01:12:40.407 --> 01:12:43.117
While spellcasters pick spells.

2134
01:12:43.117 --> 01:12:48.117
MATT: There are a handful of empty shell plated backs

2135
01:12:48.327 --> 01:12:50.716
from the similar armadillo-like creatures

2136
01:12:50.716 --> 01:12:53.402
you saw before, but they've been freshly cleared out

2137
01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:54.943
by your moorbounders.

2138
01:12:54.943 --> 01:12:58.450
They're strewn about, about eight of them in the vicinity.

2139
01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:00.061
You can see a little bit of

2140
01:13:00.061 --> 01:13:01.250
smear on the front of their face.

2141
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:02.090
They've been out hunting

2142
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:03.701
and eating while you guys were sleeping.

2143
01:13:03.701 --> 01:13:04.869
As you come to consciousness,

2144
01:13:04.869 --> 01:13:06.770
they're rested on the outside of the dome

2145
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:08.518
curled up and start waking up

2146
01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:10.774
as soon as you guys start making noise and moving around.

2147
01:13:10.774 --> 01:13:12.467
(growling)

2148
01:13:12.467 --> 01:13:14.730
TRAVIS: Any damage on them?

2149
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:16.498
MATT: Doesn't appear to be, no.

2150
01:13:16.498 --> 01:13:17.331
SAM: Cool.

2151
01:13:17.331 --> 01:13:19.915
MATT: It's a fairly safe night.

2152
01:13:19.915 --> 01:13:21.312
All right.

2153
01:13:21.312 --> 01:13:22.938
Anything you guys want to do before you start

2154
01:13:22.938 --> 01:13:23.897
continuing your path?

2155
01:13:23.897 --> 01:13:24.960
LIAM: I've already picked my spells,

2156
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.855
so I'm going to take Jannik for a runabout.

2157
01:13:28.855 --> 01:13:30.578
Get him primed for the day.

2158
01:13:30.578 --> 01:13:33.766
About a quarter mile out from the dome.

2159
01:13:33.766 --> 01:13:35.024
Oh, the dome's gone.

2160
01:13:35.024 --> 01:13:36.082
MATT: Oh yeah, dome's gone now.

2161
01:13:36.082 --> 01:13:37.029
LIAM: Yes.

2162
01:13:37.029 --> 01:13:38.130
MATT: You're just taking him for a run?

2163
01:13:38.130 --> 01:13:40.321
LIAM: Yeah. Frumpkin too.

2164
01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:41.329
MATT: (panting)

2165
01:13:41.329 --> 01:13:42.329
TALIESIN: I'm going to make food for everybody,

2166
01:13:42.329 --> 01:13:43.778
so that's going to--

2167
01:13:43.778 --> 01:13:45.250
I took that spell, so I'm going to make my food--

2168
01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:46.458
TRAVIS: I'll keep watch while this is happening,

2169
01:13:46.458 --> 01:13:48.069
since we are domeless.

2170
01:13:48.069 --> 01:13:49.677
MATT: Make a perception check.

2171
01:13:49.677 --> 01:13:50.510
TRAVIS: Shit.

2172
01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.333
Natural 20.

2173
01:13:54.333 --> 01:13:55.166
LIAM: Yeah.

2174
01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:57.500
MATT: Ooh, nice!
TRAVIS: 22.

2175
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.725
MATT: Okay.

2176
01:14:00.329 --> 01:14:02.398
Looking off in the path ahead of you,

2177
01:14:02.398 --> 01:14:04.565
you begin to see there are

2178
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.630
pockets that are safer than others.

2179
01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:11.712
There are areas where that thick tar-like sludge

2180
01:14:11.712 --> 01:14:14.192
seems to pool and spread across

2181
01:14:14.192 --> 01:14:16.352
areas and you begin to

2182
01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:17.463
mentally take note of what

2183
01:14:17.463 --> 01:14:20.563
seems to be most viable paths through that patch.

2184
01:14:20.563 --> 01:14:24.251
You also can see large craters

2185
01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:26.563
in the far distance towards the horizon

2186
01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:28.224
on that way. There's areas of land

2187
01:14:28.224 --> 01:14:29.872
where it seems to drop off

2188
01:14:29.872 --> 01:14:32.163
into these heavy pits.

2189
01:14:34.472 --> 01:14:37.144
Nothing catches your eye as an immediate danger,

2190
01:14:37.144 --> 01:14:38.843
but you do notice a few elements

2191
01:14:38.843 --> 01:14:39.704
of the path ahead of you

2192
01:14:39.704 --> 01:14:42.603
to make it a safer journey.

2193
01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:43.436
TRAVIS: Man, the terrain ahead

2194
01:14:43.436 --> 01:14:46.391
is going to be gonzo, you guys.

2195
01:14:46.391 --> 01:14:48.464
Might have to move at a three-quarter pace

2196
01:14:48.464 --> 01:14:50.464
or something instead of dead sprint.

2197
01:14:50.464 --> 01:14:51.922
MARISHA: You think that black sludgy shit

2198
01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:53.838
will hurt you?

2199
01:14:53.838 --> 01:14:55.633
TRAVIS: I mean, it's a fair bet.

2200
01:14:55.633 --> 01:14:57.790
I don't know what it is.

2201
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.643
There's also whole pockets of earth

2202
01:14:59.643 --> 01:15:02.443
and area that just, (whistles) gone.

2203
01:15:02.443 --> 01:15:04.032
MARISHA: Bottomless pits?

2204
01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:06.699
TRAVIS: Your guess is as good as mine.

2205
01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:12.059
SAM: This is where the wars happened long ago?

2206
01:15:12.059 --> 01:15:13.712
TRAVIS: As I understand it, yeah.

2207
01:15:13.712 --> 01:15:16.121
MARISHA: She said the final battle.

2208
01:15:16.121 --> 01:15:17.501
SAM: Dang.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2209
01:15:17.501 --> 01:15:19.510
Left some pock-marks.

2210
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:20.343
TALIESIN: Food made.

2211
01:15:21.409 --> 01:15:22.242
SAM: Food made?

2212
01:15:22.242 --> 01:15:23.411
TALIESIN: We're all good, we got food.

2213
01:15:23.411 --> 01:15:25.651
SAM: Enough for the moorbounders as well?

2214
01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:28.279
TALIESIN: Well, they're not going to like it.

2215
01:15:28.279 --> 01:15:30.560
It's a, yeah.

2216
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.227
Sustain up to 15 humanoids and five steeds

2217
01:15:33.227 --> 01:15:34.924
for 24 hours.

2218
01:15:34.924 --> 01:15:35.757
Plus water.

2219
01:15:35.757 --> 01:15:37.686
TRAVIS: Jesus, that's awesome.

2220
01:15:37.686 --> 01:15:39.820
MARISHA: This is your tofu?

2221
01:15:40.662 --> 01:15:43.221
Chili? Your boba balls?

2222
01:15:43.221 --> 01:15:44.054
TALIESIN: It's boba ball.

2223
01:15:44.054 --> 01:15:46.128
MATT: So 15 humanoids--

2224
01:15:46.128 --> 01:15:48.676
TALIESIN: Or five steeds.
MATT: <i>Or</i> five steeds.

2225
01:15:48.676 --> 01:15:50.352
All right, so I'd say,

2226
01:15:50.352 --> 01:15:53.501
15 humanoids, you can feed--

2227
01:15:53.501 --> 01:15:56.421
LIAM: In the meantime, I have this jar of

2228
01:15:56.421 --> 01:15:59.045
beads that would feed us.

2229
01:15:59.045 --> 01:16:00.621
MATT: You could almost feed all the moorbounders.

2230
01:16:00.621 --> 01:16:03.003
You could feed you guys and one and a half moorbounders.

2231
01:16:03.003 --> 01:16:04.312
TALIESIN: Yeah, they're eating,

2232
01:16:04.312 --> 01:16:05.780
they seem to be eating as well.

2233
01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.013
MATT: Yeah. So you're fine.

2234
01:16:07.013 --> 01:16:08.533
TALIESIN: All the food needed, that's fine.

2235
01:16:08.533 --> 01:16:09.522
MARISHA: Okay, come on, let's go,

2236
01:16:09.522 --> 01:16:11.403
this fuck-face is getting away from us.

2237
01:16:11.403 --> 01:16:12.861
LAURA: Yeah, yeah!

2238
01:16:12.861 --> 01:16:13.694
TRAVIS: Hiyah!

2239
01:16:14.919 --> 01:16:16.475
LAURA: Don't you hiyah my Yarnball!

2240
01:16:16.475 --> 01:16:19.426
TRAVIS: Sorry, it's a habit. I'm not driving.

2241
01:16:19.426 --> 01:16:21.396
SAM: Can anyone search for tracks as we go?

2242
01:16:21.396 --> 01:16:24.646
Anyone who, Yasha knows the area, or...

2243
01:16:25.716 --> 01:16:27.657
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye out for things.

2244
01:16:27.657 --> 01:16:28.807
LAURA: Yeah.

2245
01:16:28.807 --> 01:16:30.716
MATT: Right, who wants to look for tracks?

2246
01:16:30.716 --> 01:16:31.549
LIAM: I'll look.

2247
01:16:31.549 --> 01:16:32.927
SAM: Right, because they moved through here,

2248
01:16:32.927 --> 01:16:35.137
maybe, if they took this route.

2249
01:16:35.137 --> 01:16:36.476
TALIESIN: They probably took the safe route.

2250
01:16:36.476 --> 01:16:38.107
TRAVIS: Caleb and--
LIAM: I will look.

2251
01:16:38.107 --> 01:16:39.407
MATT: All right, so Caleb and who else?

2252
01:16:39.407 --> 01:16:40.240
LAURA: I'll look, sure.

2253
01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.215
MATT: Both of you guys make survival checks, please.

2254
01:16:43.215 --> 01:16:44.615
LIAM: Survival, that's a natural one.

2255
01:16:44.615 --> 01:16:45.448
MATT: Oh.

2256
01:16:45.448 --> 01:16:46.906
LAURA: 18.

2257
01:16:46.906 --> 01:16:47.947
MATT: 18, okay.

2258
01:16:47.947 --> 01:16:50.035
This terrain is very alien to you,

2259
01:16:50.035 --> 01:16:50.868
and you have no idea to

2260
01:16:50.868 --> 01:16:52.967
how the patterns cross it at all,

2261
01:16:52.967 --> 01:16:55.927
you're flustered by it.

2262
01:16:55.927 --> 01:16:58.986
Jester, looking around, you see tracks,

2263
01:17:03.687 --> 01:17:05.697
some of them look like small creatures,

2264
01:17:05.697 --> 01:17:08.436
some of them large creatures.

2265
01:17:08.436 --> 01:17:12.686
Some of them look humanoid and older, but nothing--

2266
01:17:12.686 --> 01:17:14.694
you have no discerning way of knowing

2267
01:17:14.694 --> 01:17:17.362
what tracks may be the individual

2268
01:17:17.362 --> 01:17:18.316
you've been seeking or not.

2269
01:17:18.316 --> 01:17:20.362
They're all sorts of manner of tracks around you.

2270
01:17:20.362 --> 01:17:22.522
LAURA: Yeah, there's lots of footprints and stuff.

2271
01:17:22.522 --> 01:17:23.623
SAM: Okay.

2272
01:17:23.623 --> 01:17:25.447
TALIESIN: Keeping an eye out for anything unusual.

2273
01:17:25.447 --> 01:17:26.961
MATT: Go ahead and perception check.

2274
01:17:26.961 --> 01:17:28.482
TRAVIS: We're not on a trail per se, right?

2275
01:17:28.482 --> 01:17:29.674
It's pretty open and cracked.

2276
01:17:29.674 --> 01:17:31.242
MATT: It's open.
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2277
01:17:31.242 --> 01:17:33.034
MATT: There's no set trails here.

2278
01:17:33.034 --> 01:17:34.194
TALIESIN: 26.

2279
01:17:34.194 --> 01:17:35.492
MATT: 26, okay.

2280
01:17:35.492 --> 01:17:36.650
Good to know.

2281
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:38.263
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2282
01:17:38.263 --> 01:17:39.096
Fuck yeah.

2283
01:17:39.096 --> 01:17:40.133
MATT: Okay.

2284
01:17:40.133 --> 01:17:41.533
So.

2285
01:17:41.533 --> 01:17:43.834
Progressing forward,

2286
01:17:43.834 --> 01:17:46.122
one hour, two hours,

2287
01:17:46.122 --> 01:17:49.101
the heat begins to cool a bit,

2288
01:17:49.101 --> 01:17:51.173
the clouds begin to close back in,

2289
01:17:51.173 --> 01:17:54.023
the bright sunlight that was peering through

2290
01:17:54.023 --> 01:17:58.773
begins to vanish under the familiar gray skies of Xhorhas

2291
01:18:00.292 --> 01:18:03.063
Following Fjord's lead, you've managed to move

2292
01:18:03.063 --> 01:18:04.354
around some of these tar pockets,

2293
01:18:04.354 --> 01:18:05.187
and as you go by,

2294
01:18:05.187 --> 01:18:09.863
they're a dark, deep brown-green color.

2295
01:18:09.863 --> 01:18:11.663
As you approach,

2296
01:18:11.663 --> 01:18:14.662
they're still. Nothing seems to--

2297
01:18:14.662 --> 01:18:17.201
there's no wind where you are currently.

2298
01:18:17.201 --> 01:18:20.588
It's this slick, reflective surface.

2299
01:18:21.973 --> 01:18:25.960
You maneuver through the patches of it.

2300
01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.183
You go past one of these larger pits,

2301
01:18:28.183 --> 01:18:32.799
and you see a grayish mound

2302
01:18:32.799 --> 01:18:34.503
in the center of it,

2303
01:18:34.503 --> 01:18:36.922
about five feet across.

2304
01:18:36.922 --> 01:18:40.023
You maneuver around past that.

2305
01:18:40.023 --> 01:18:42.943
TRAVIS: Is it a being that got stuck?

2306
01:18:42.943 --> 01:18:44.954
MATT: Make a perception check.

2307
01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:46.787
LAURA: Is it moving at all?

2308
01:18:48.154 --> 01:18:48.987
TRAVIS: Seven.

2309
01:18:48.987 --> 01:18:50.792
LIAM: Is it natural?

2310
01:18:52.242 --> 01:18:54.212
MATT: I'll say, with your perception check you had earlier

2311
01:18:54.212 --> 01:18:55.487
as a general look,

2312
01:18:55.487 --> 01:18:57.399
it does look like bone.

2313
01:18:58.941 --> 01:19:03.341
That may be a creature that got caught and went in

2314
01:19:03.341 --> 01:19:05.174
and did not escape.

2315
01:19:06.111 --> 01:19:08.911
There are elements of it that remind you of tar,

2316
01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:11.299
except for the coloration.

2317
01:19:11.299 --> 01:19:12.341
TALIESIN: Right.

2318
01:19:12.341 --> 01:19:14.301
TRAVIS: Nott, you need a sample of this for any reason?

2319
01:19:14.301 --> 01:19:15.191
TALIESIN: I wouldn't get too close.

2320
01:19:15.191 --> 01:19:18.133
MATT: Brown-green. At certain angles

2321
01:19:18.133 --> 01:19:20.461
and certain bits of light, it shifts from one to the other.

2322
01:19:20.461 --> 01:19:21.294
SAM: I'm okay.

2323
01:19:23.042 --> 01:19:24.392
SAM: I'm okay.
TRAVIS: All right.

2324
01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:27.121
MATT: Okay, continue on.

2325
01:19:27.121 --> 01:19:28.538
A few more hours.

2326
01:19:30.202 --> 01:19:33.722
You begin to now approach the large spires

2327
01:19:33.722 --> 01:19:37.400
that you had seen on the horizon before.

2328
01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:42.202
Some of these are bits of dark rock

2329
01:19:42.202 --> 01:19:44.061
that don't match the brown

2330
01:19:44.061 --> 01:19:47.061
and red floor of this wide badlands.

2331
01:19:48.394 --> 01:19:50.853
It's like a deep, dark gray,

2332
01:19:50.853 --> 01:19:54.053
and they're ranging anywhere

2333
01:19:54.053 --> 01:19:57.302
between 15 to 40 feet tall.

2334
01:19:57.302 --> 01:19:59.520
They're thin, and they're

2335
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.053
jutting out of the ground

2336
01:20:01.053 --> 01:20:02.853
like they were placed there

2337
01:20:02.853 --> 01:20:06.402
or were pushed out from underneath.

2338
01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:07.235
You did

2339
01:20:08.743 --> 01:20:10.713
briefly encounter the Penumbra Range

2340
01:20:10.713 --> 01:20:13.663
when you were going towards the stone giants' fort,

2341
01:20:13.663 --> 01:20:15.404
and the coloration and texture

2342
01:20:15.404 --> 01:20:17.594
of this rock seems similar.

2343
01:20:17.594 --> 01:20:20.343
This rock seems to be of the same rock

2344
01:20:20.343 --> 01:20:23.274
that the mountain range known as the Penumbra Range

2345
01:20:23.274 --> 01:20:25.573
is made of, but they do not--

2346
01:20:25.573 --> 01:20:27.085
they seem deliberately placed.

2347
01:20:27.085 --> 01:20:30.583
Their massive size, and some of them being curved

2348
01:20:30.583 --> 01:20:32.533
to a point, jutting outward,

2349
01:20:32.533 --> 01:20:34.932
is a curious and

2350
01:20:37.033 --> 01:20:39.714
unnatural feel to their placement.

2351
01:20:39.714 --> 01:20:41.383
LIAM: Seemingly random placement.

2352
01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:43.049
MATT: Yep.

2353
01:20:43.049 --> 01:20:46.533
You come across two, and keep a wide berth.

2354
01:20:46.533 --> 01:20:48.463
The first one you come up nearby

2355
01:20:48.463 --> 01:20:49.933
is about 20 feet tall,

2356
01:20:49.933 --> 01:20:52.631
it's just straight, sticking out of the ground.

2357
01:20:52.631 --> 01:20:54.922
LIAM: Do they bear any resemblance to bones themselves?

2358
01:20:54.922 --> 01:20:56.693
Large bones?

2359
01:20:56.693 --> 01:20:58.983
MATT: Do you want to go up and take a look?

2360
01:20:58.983 --> 01:21:03.983
LIAM: I will send Frumpkin to land on top of one.

2361
01:21:04.345 --> 01:21:05.511
Take a look.

2362
01:21:05.511 --> 01:21:08.869
MATT: Okay. You look into Frumpkin's eyes?
LIAM: Yeah.

2363
01:21:08.869 --> 01:21:10.794
MATT: All right, roll a medicine check.

2364
01:21:10.794 --> 01:21:13.325
LIAM: Medicine check, oof.

2365
01:21:13.325 --> 01:21:15.474
Ooh!

2366
01:21:15.474 --> 01:21:16.573
22.

2367
01:21:16.573 --> 01:21:17.406
MATT: 22.

2368
01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.085
Best you can tell,

2369
01:21:20.085 --> 01:21:22.585
these don't appear to be bone.

2370
01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.453
You're just not,

2371
01:21:25.453 --> 01:21:29.130
these aren't, you know, natural from a creature's body.

2372
01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:30.128
LIAM: Yeah.

2373
01:21:30.128 --> 01:21:32.654
MATT: They're large structures made of stone.

2374
01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:35.658
You have no idea of whom or where

2375
01:21:35.658 --> 01:21:37.109
or how old these may be.

2376
01:21:37.109 --> 01:21:38.818
MARISHA: They're pointed and jagged.

2377
01:21:38.818 --> 01:21:41.229
MATT: Random directions, in different places, it's --

2378
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:43.587
TRAVIS: Not etched or glyphed or symbols on them?

2379
01:21:43.587 --> 01:21:44.877
MATT: Nope.

2380
01:21:44.877 --> 01:21:48.062
LIAM: They don't look like they've, you go ahead, sorry.

2381
01:21:48.062 --> 01:21:49.357
ASHLEY: 15 to 40 feet tall?

2382
01:21:49.357 --> 01:21:50.190
MATT: Yeah.

2383
01:21:51.516 --> 01:21:52.349
SAM: Tons of them?

2384
01:21:52.349 --> 01:21:54.029
Like Fortress of Solitude?

2385
01:21:54.029 --> 01:21:54.862
MATT: No, no.

2386
01:21:54.862 --> 01:21:59.568
Like you'll come across one every mile or so.

2387
01:21:59.568 --> 01:22:00.418
SAM: Oh, okay.

2388
01:22:00.418 --> 01:22:01.251
LAURA: Oh, that's cooler.

2389
01:22:01.251 --> 01:22:02.277
MATT: At some point, you come across

2390
01:22:02.277 --> 01:22:03.949
two or three within a mile,

2391
01:22:03.949 --> 01:22:04.782
and then sometimes you go a stretch

2392
01:22:04.782 --> 01:22:06.629
of five miles without any.

2393
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:08.667
They're randomly distributed

2394
01:22:08.667 --> 01:22:10.709
and different sizes and different angles

2395
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:12.018
and placed across the fields.

2396
01:22:12.018 --> 01:22:13.418
LAURA: I wonder if you could fly really high

2397
01:22:13.418 --> 01:22:16.488
if you would see a pattern?

2398
01:22:16.488 --> 01:22:17.864
SAM: Maybe?

2399
01:22:17.864 --> 01:22:19.746
LIAM: That's a good idea.

2400
01:22:19.746 --> 01:22:21.317
I was going to ask,

2401
01:22:21.317 --> 01:22:23.106
but then I'm going to take her up on that,

2402
01:22:23.106 --> 01:22:24.886
do they look like they've erupted up,

2403
01:22:24.886 --> 01:22:26.554
or have been, (blows raspberry).

2404
01:22:26.554 --> 01:22:29.044
Or been here too long to tell.

2405
01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.158
MATT: Uh.

2406
01:22:30.158 --> 01:22:31.241
TRAVIS: The earth around--

2407
01:22:31.241 --> 01:22:33.928
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

2408
01:22:33.928 --> 01:22:35.511
MARISHA: Going up with it?

2409
01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:37.506
LIAM: 21.

2410
01:22:37.506 --> 01:22:42.490
MATT: These have been here long enough

2411
01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.058
where there's no way of knowing.

2412
01:22:44.058 --> 01:22:45.145
TRAVIS: Wow. (laughs)

2413
01:22:45.145 --> 01:22:47.966
MATT: The earth that's been around them

2414
01:22:47.966 --> 01:22:51.258
has-- there's a combination of

2415
01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:53.346
gathered through wind and dust

2416
01:22:53.346 --> 01:22:56.048
that has caused a slight

2417
01:22:56.048 --> 01:22:58.418
gathering around the exterior of the base,

2418
01:22:58.418 --> 01:23:01.746
but there's no sign of rock erupted

2419
01:23:01.746 --> 01:23:03.858
around it from a recent impact

2420
01:23:03.858 --> 01:23:06.786
or comparatively any cracks that show--

2421
01:23:06.786 --> 01:23:08.029
they've been there long enough

2422
01:23:08.029 --> 01:23:10.005
where they merged with the scenery,

2423
01:23:10.005 --> 01:23:12.818
so you're not able to ascertain

2424
01:23:12.818 --> 01:23:14.559
the direction in which they arrived.

2425
01:23:14.559 --> 01:23:15.606
LIAM: Okay, well, we must be at a halt,

2426
01:23:15.606 --> 01:23:18.571
since we're the only ones who can ride these things.

2427
01:23:18.571 --> 01:23:20.160
Training them, and she called that out,

2428
01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.137
so I will send Frumpkin spiraling up

2429
01:23:23.137 --> 01:23:24.978
quite high to look down.

2430
01:23:24.978 --> 01:23:26.617
This'll probably take a few minutes.

2431
01:23:26.617 --> 01:23:27.450
MATT: Okay.

2432
01:23:27.450 --> 01:23:28.737
LIAM: Like a mile into the air.

2433
01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:29.847
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

2434
01:23:29.847 --> 01:23:30.937
Frumpkin goes a mile into the air

2435
01:23:30.937 --> 01:23:33.239
and looks down and sees

2436
01:23:33.239 --> 01:23:37.057
from his position, about seven or so

2437
01:23:37.057 --> 01:23:38.537
within sight.

2438
01:23:38.537 --> 01:23:39.919
LIAM: They don't create a big smiley face

2439
01:23:39.919 --> 01:23:41.519
or anything from above.

2440
01:23:41.519 --> 01:23:42.803
MATT: Not from his perspective, no.

2441
01:23:42.803 --> 01:23:44.659
TRAVIS: Captain Tusktooth.

2442
01:23:44.659 --> 01:23:46.208
(laughter)

2443
01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:47.617
LAURA: It's a sign!

2444
01:23:47.617 --> 01:23:48.742
TRAVIS: The tar pits are googly eyes.

2445
01:23:48.742 --> 01:23:50.579
MATT: It's a big dick.

2446
01:23:50.579 --> 01:23:52.572
TRAVIS: Just a big chode.

2447
01:23:52.572 --> 01:23:54.005
LIAM: No patterns.

2448
01:23:54.005 --> 01:23:55.695
SAM: It's the Barbed Fields?

2449
01:23:55.695 --> 01:23:57.023
ASHLEY: The Barbed Fields.

2450
01:23:57.023 --> 01:23:58.495
SAM: I mean, these are the barbs.

2451
01:23:58.495 --> 01:23:59.564
ASHLEY: These are the barbs, yeah.

2452
01:23:59.564 --> 01:24:02.162
TALIESIN: I'll also say, I mean,

2453
01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.479
If they were dropped from the sky

2454
01:24:03.479 --> 01:24:04.553
or if they sprung from the earth,

2455
01:24:04.553 --> 01:24:05.953
what did they spring from?

2456
01:24:05.953 --> 01:24:07.252
Might be something underneath them,

2457
01:24:07.252 --> 01:24:08.641
but that would be--

2458
01:24:08.641 --> 01:24:10.742
TRAVIS: Terrible and horrifying.
TALIESIN: A lot to--

2459
01:24:10.742 --> 01:24:11.575
TRAVIS: Let's not.

2460
01:24:11.575 --> 01:24:14.543
LAURA: It's so old, it's probably dead by now, anyway.

2461
01:24:14.543 --> 01:24:16.209
MATT: Make a history check.

2462
01:24:16.209 --> 01:24:17.241
TRAVIS: Oh no!

2463
01:24:19.043 --> 01:24:21.023
LIAM: Mm. Balls.

2464
01:24:21.023 --> 01:24:22.108
SAM: Why don't you use your dunamancy?

2465
01:24:22.108 --> 01:24:23.687
MARISHA: Would I have heard anything?

2466
01:24:23.687 --> 01:24:24.520
MATT: Yeah, make a history check as well.

2467
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.728
LIAM: In advance.

2468
01:24:25.728 --> 01:24:27.104
MATT: You both are fairly learned.
SAM: You have to say

2469
01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:28.687
if you're going to roll the luck before?

2470
01:24:28.687 --> 01:24:30.104
LIAM: 12, it's a spell.

2471
01:24:31.645 --> 01:24:34.062
You have to have it pre-cast.
MARISHA: 15.

2472
01:24:35.165 --> 01:24:36.772
MATT: (sighs) Nothing's ringing a bell

2473
01:24:36.772 --> 01:24:40.204
for either of you guys, unfortunately.

2474
01:24:40.204 --> 01:24:41.044
That's all right.

2475
01:24:41.044 --> 01:24:41.877
TRAVIS: Onward.

2476
01:24:42.723 --> 01:24:43.924
LIAM: Rolled a two.

2477
01:24:43.924 --> 01:24:44.757
What are you going to do?

2478
01:24:44.757 --> 01:24:46.153
MATT: What are you going to do?

2479
01:24:46.153 --> 01:24:47.883
You continue to press on,

2480
01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:49.655
deeper and deeper into the Barbed Fields,

2481
01:24:49.655 --> 01:24:53.164
your first full day of travel northward,

2482
01:24:53.164 --> 01:24:56.873
hours go by, the sun behind the clouds,

2483
01:24:56.873 --> 01:24:59.663
you can feel the temperature getting cooler and cooler,

2484
01:24:59.663 --> 01:25:02.684
eventually, the light begins to grow darker and darker

2485
01:25:02.684 --> 01:25:04.375
as it gets closer to dusk.

2486
01:25:04.375 --> 01:25:07.263
Passing by-- what are you laughing at?

2487
01:25:07.263 --> 01:25:08.096
LAURA: Nothing. I'm good.

2488
01:25:08.096 --> 01:25:10.023
LIAM: Doodle, Sam drew a doodle of some kind.

2489
01:25:10.023 --> 01:25:10.856
MATT: Problematic.

2490
01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:11.689
LIAM: It's probably lewd.

2491
01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:13.522
MARISHA: Problematic!

2492
01:25:13.522 --> 01:25:14.939
MATT: Pushing onward,

2493
01:25:16.848 --> 01:25:18.098
you begin to...

2494
01:25:22.212 --> 01:25:23.581
I totally lost my train of thought.

2495
01:25:23.581 --> 01:25:25.764
(laughter)

2496
01:25:25.764 --> 01:25:27.257
TALIESIN: Been a week.

2497
01:25:27.257 --> 01:25:28.674
MATT: It's been a week.

2498
01:25:29.703 --> 01:25:31.356
Anyway.

2499
01:25:31.356 --> 01:25:32.345
LAURA: Blame him!

2500
01:25:32.345 --> 01:25:34.079
LIAM: Hey man, I'm throwing up Mage Armor,

2501
01:25:34.079 --> 01:25:36.626
and I'm giving the Gift of Alacrity to Beauregard.

2502
01:25:36.626 --> 01:25:38.241
MARISHA: What's that do?

2503
01:25:38.241 --> 01:25:39.157
Oh, is that that thing?

2504
01:25:39.157 --> 01:25:40.677
LIAM: Yep.

2505
01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:42.922
MARISHA: What's it do again?

2506
01:25:42.922 --> 01:25:45.205
LIAM: It adds to your initiative.

2507
01:25:45.205 --> 01:25:49.946
MATT: After Caleb casts Mage Armor on himself,

2508
01:25:49.946 --> 01:25:51.525
reaches over and touches your shoulder,

2509
01:25:51.525 --> 01:25:52.925
you watch as the hand approaches you,

2510
01:25:52.925 --> 01:25:55.586
there's this slight gathering of dark energy

2511
01:25:55.586 --> 01:25:57.986
that swirls around his hand

2512
01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:00.374
and these tiny little specks of light

2513
01:26:00.374 --> 01:26:02.624
that blink through it as it

2514
01:26:03.466 --> 01:26:05.322
reaches over and grabs your shoulder.

2515
01:26:05.322 --> 01:26:08.694
You feel this brief surge through your body,

2516
01:26:08.694 --> 01:26:11.935
and for a second, everything goes into slow-motion.

2517
01:26:11.935 --> 01:26:14.762
Then reverts back to normal.

2518
01:26:14.762 --> 01:26:18.574
MARISHA: Shit's almost unsettling if it wasn't so dope.

2519
01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:20.335
LIAM: (sighs) Par for the course.

2520
01:26:20.335 --> 01:26:23.330
I just invented golf, canon.

2521
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:25.744
(laughter)

2522
01:26:25.744 --> 01:26:27.560
TALIESIN: I hate you all.

2523
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.268
(laughter)

2524
01:26:32.426 --> 01:26:35.095
TRAVIS: The Masters course, out here on the Barbed Fields!

2525
01:26:35.095 --> 01:26:37.345
(laughter)

2526
01:26:38.957 --> 01:26:40.451
With a par nine!

2527
01:26:40.451 --> 01:26:44.292
(laughter)

2528
01:26:47.064 --> 01:26:50.558
LAURA: Bad luck, the ball landed in an oily tar pit.

2529
01:26:50.558 --> 01:26:52.199
TRAVIS: That's a six stroke penalty.

2530
01:26:52.199 --> 01:26:53.532
MATT: That's a time.

2531
01:26:55.146 --> 01:26:59.063
Continue to pass by clusters of leafless trees,

2532
01:27:00.178 --> 01:27:03.666
some are completely broken in the center,

2533
01:27:03.666 --> 01:27:05.515
burned, charcoal,

2534
01:27:05.515 --> 01:27:09.098
some appear to have petrified over time.

2535
01:27:09.098 --> 01:27:11.028
It's like walking through

2536
01:27:11.028 --> 01:27:14.578
a graveyard of nature and time

2537
01:27:14.578 --> 01:27:19.578
at different places. Occasionally, you hear, (bird caws)

2538
01:27:19.757 --> 01:27:23.429
different birds that have come out this far.

2539
01:27:23.429 --> 01:27:26.557
Largely scavenging birds, vultures, similar

2540
01:27:26.557 --> 01:27:30.382
to what you had given a form.

2541
01:27:33.186 --> 01:27:35.847
You get partway through this one section

2542
01:27:35.847 --> 01:27:39.897
of broken trees and a large chunk of ruin

2543
01:27:41.749 --> 01:27:43.999
before-- who's at the front?

2544
01:27:44.834 --> 01:27:45.957
LAURA: I guess it would have been me

2545
01:27:45.957 --> 01:27:48.698
and we were checking for--

2546
01:27:48.698 --> 01:27:50.693
TRAVIS: I was, well, I guess--

2547
01:27:50.693 --> 01:27:51.743
We made it to the barbs,

2548
01:27:51.743 --> 01:27:53.127
so I won't have to be any more of my 20,

2549
01:27:53.127 --> 01:27:54.965
probably wore off.

2550
01:27:54.965 --> 01:27:56.669
MATT: Who's at the front?

2551
01:27:56.669 --> 01:27:57.621
TRAVIS: I'll be with you, Jester.

2552
01:27:57.621 --> 01:27:58.620
MATT: All righty.

2553
01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:02.310
You guys are the front moorbounder.

2554
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:05.202
You're moving through the area,

2555
01:28:05.202 --> 01:28:08.512
leaping quickly before your mount suddenly

2556
01:28:08.512 --> 01:28:12.617
stops for a second and goes, (sniffing)

2557
01:28:12.617 --> 01:28:14.758
LAURA: What is it, Yarnball, what do you smell?

2558
01:28:14.758 --> 01:28:18.056
MATT: (growling)

2559
01:28:18.056 --> 01:28:21.657
You can see, there's a person

2560
01:28:21.657 --> 01:28:23.169
sitting next to one of the trees

2561
01:28:23.169 --> 01:28:25.337
facing away from you, leaning against it.

2562
01:28:25.337 --> 01:28:26.937
LAURA: Caleb, kill them.

2563
01:28:26.937 --> 01:28:28.322
TRAVIS: No! Shh!

2564
01:28:28.322 --> 01:28:29.530
LIAM: Why do we want to do that?

2565
01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:30.657
We don't know anything.

2566
01:28:30.657 --> 01:28:32.015
TALIESIN: I'm going to Eyes of the Grave.

2567
01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:33.217
MATT: Eyes of the Grave?

2568
01:28:33.217 --> 01:28:34.050
Okay.

2569
01:28:35.228 --> 01:28:36.066
Nothing--

2570
01:28:36.066 --> 01:28:36.899
TALIESIN: Okay.

2571
01:28:36.899 --> 01:28:38.148
MATT: Nothing catches your interest.

2572
01:28:38.148 --> 01:28:38.981
TALIESIN: Cool.

2573
01:28:40.585 --> 01:28:43.002
LAURA: Should we call out to them?

2574
01:28:43.908 --> 01:28:46.288
What do they look like from,

2575
01:28:46.288 --> 01:28:47.228
are we seeing them--

2576
01:28:47.228 --> 01:28:48.061
MATT: Make a perception check.

2577
01:28:48.061 --> 01:28:50.811
LAURA: Okay. (laughs)

2578
01:28:51.929 --> 01:28:53.497
Oh.

2579
01:28:53.497 --> 01:28:54.609
Eight!

2580
01:28:54.609 --> 01:28:55.456
MATT: Eight?

2581
01:28:55.456 --> 01:28:56.529
It's hard to see at this distance.

2582
01:28:56.529 --> 01:28:58.078
The sun's getting close to setting

2583
01:28:58.078 --> 01:28:59.156
and there's now these long shadows

2584
01:28:59.156 --> 01:29:01.457
stretching across the field.

2585
01:29:01.457 --> 01:29:05.207
From what you can see, a pale person

2586
01:29:06.638 --> 01:29:08.668
just leaning away from you

2587
01:29:08.668 --> 01:29:09.558
against the tree.

2588
01:29:09.558 --> 01:29:12.147
TRAVIS: In the shade, or is there still leafless trees?

2589
01:29:12.147 --> 01:29:13.813
MATT: Leafless trees, there's no shade.

2590
01:29:13.813 --> 01:29:14.697
TRAVIS: There's only one of them.

2591
01:29:14.697 --> 01:29:16.329
I mean, come on, there's all of us.

2592
01:29:16.329 --> 01:29:17.946
TALIESIN: I'm looking all around.

2593
01:29:17.946 --> 01:29:20.409
MARISHA: This feels like a honeypot.

2594
01:29:20.409 --> 01:29:21.729
SAM: I'm going to get off the moorbounder

2595
01:29:21.729 --> 01:29:23.617
and flank right.

2596
01:29:23.617 --> 01:29:24.450
MATT: Okay.

2597
01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:26.231
SAM: Weapon drawn.

2598
01:29:26.231 --> 01:29:28.146
LAURA: Should I just call out to them?

2599
01:29:28.146 --> 01:29:29.812
TRAVIS: Sure.
LIAM: Not yet, not yet.

2600
01:29:29.812 --> 01:29:31.177
LAURA: Can I send him a message?

2601
01:29:31.177 --> 01:29:34.759
MARISHA: I'm going to jump off the moorbounder just in case.

2602
01:29:34.759 --> 01:29:37.259
LIAM: What if I send my bird to sit in that tree

2603
01:29:37.259 --> 01:29:38.845
to get a closer look.

2604
01:29:38.845 --> 01:29:39.777
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

2605
01:29:39.777 --> 01:29:42.468
LAURA: I mean, there's nothing for a very a long time,

2606
01:29:42.468 --> 01:29:44.668
they're probably heard us coming up.

2607
01:29:44.668 --> 01:29:47.079
MARISHA: That's why it freaks me out.

2608
01:29:47.079 --> 01:29:48.297
LAURA: Maybe he's dead.

2609
01:29:48.297 --> 01:29:49.130
MARISHA: Maybe he is.

2610
01:29:49.130 --> 01:29:51.636
LIAM: I send Frumpkin off to sit in the tree above.

2611
01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:52.769
TALIESIN: It would tell me if they're undead.

2612
01:29:52.769 --> 01:29:54.380
It wouldn't tell me if they're dead.

2613
01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.876
MATT: Okay.

2614
01:29:55.876 --> 01:29:58.487
Yeah, there's, you don't get any undead presence.

2615
01:29:58.487 --> 01:30:01.356
Frumpkin lands on the branch

2616
01:30:01.356 --> 01:30:02.577
and looks down.

2617
01:30:02.577 --> 01:30:03.977
Are you looking through his eyes?

2618
01:30:03.977 --> 01:30:04.810
LIAM: Yeah.

2619
01:30:04.810 --> 01:30:05.643
MATT: All right, you see

2620
01:30:05.643 --> 01:30:07.634
a humanoid,

2621
01:30:08.526 --> 01:30:12.209
pale gray skin, no hair.

2622
01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:15.276
And just--

2623
01:30:15.276 --> 01:30:16.526
LIAM: And breathing, seemingly alive?

2624
01:30:16.526 --> 01:30:17.359
MATT: Make a perception check.

2625
01:30:17.359 --> 01:30:19.254
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

2626
01:30:19.254 --> 01:30:22.370
Use this die that has been fucking me up.

2627
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:23.645
TRAVIS: Does the fucking continue?

2628
01:30:23.645 --> 01:30:25.177
LIAM: I hope so.

2629
01:30:25.177 --> 01:30:26.348
14.

2630
01:30:26.348 --> 01:30:27.181
MATT: 14?

2631
01:30:28.188 --> 01:30:30.188
He appears to be breathing.

2632
01:30:30.188 --> 01:30:31.021
LIAM: Okay.

2633
01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:32.366
LAURA: Are his eyes open or closed?

2634
01:30:32.366 --> 01:30:33.838
MATT: Hard to see from this side.
LIAM: Can't hear.

2635
01:30:33.838 --> 01:30:35.636
SAM: Does he have a dope as hell beard?

2636
01:30:35.636 --> 01:30:37.136
(laughter)

2637
01:30:37.136 --> 01:30:39.217
LIAM: Is he zoned out or is he--

2638
01:30:39.217 --> 01:30:40.616
MATT: Can't see from this position.

2639
01:30:40.616 --> 01:30:44.257
TRAVIS: Muscular figure or emaciated and slim?

2640
01:30:44.257 --> 01:30:46.340
MATT: Looks a little slender.

2641
01:30:47.444 --> 01:30:48.566
It's hard to tell from this distance.

01:37:06.991 --> 01:37:09.130
"to become a horse as an apology to the fans?"

2817
01:37:09.130 --> 01:37:10.078
LIAM: I knew it.

2818
01:37:10.078 --> 01:37:11.744
I knew it.

2819
01:37:11.744 --> 01:37:13.911
Man, I need an apology to myself,

2820
01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:15.828
that did not feel good.

2821
01:37:16.833 --> 01:37:18.416
I did not kill the horse on purpose,

2822
01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:19.905
I meant to hurt it

2823
01:37:19.905 --> 01:37:21.374
and get it the hell out of the way.

2824
01:37:21.374 --> 01:37:22.772
SAM: Just say that one more time

2825
01:37:22.772 --> 01:37:25.361
as a complete sentence to camera.

2826
01:37:25.361 --> 01:37:28.561
I, Liam O'Brien, purposely killed an animal.

2827
01:37:28.561 --> 01:37:30.969
(laughter)

2828
01:37:30.969 --> 01:37:32.928
That would help my campaign a lot.

2829
01:37:32.928 --> 01:37:34.494
DANI: Yeah, it would. If you could just repeat that verbatim

2830
01:37:34.494 --> 01:37:35.736
BRIAN: Do not do it, as your attorney,

2831
01:37:35.736 --> 01:37:38.036
I would advise you not to listen to that.

2832
01:37:38.036 --> 01:37:38.869
DANI: This isn't your time.

2833
01:37:38.869 --> 01:37:41.199
LIAM: I love animals, do you know how many times

2834
01:37:41.199 --> 01:37:44.729
I've gotten down and cuddled and pet Henry the dog?

2835
01:37:44.729 --> 01:37:47.641
Do you know how many times Sam has pet Henry the dog?

2836
01:37:47.641 --> 01:37:48.870
BRIAN: Never.

2837
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:50.241
You have never touched that dog.

2838
01:37:50.241 --> 01:37:51.470
SAM: You know why?

2839
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:52.303
BRIAN: Why?

2840
01:37:52.303 --> 01:37:53.769
SAM: Germs. I don't want--

2841
01:37:53.769 --> 01:37:54.802
BRIAN: Germs?

2842
01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:56.468
SAM: I don't want animal germs--

2843
01:37:56.468 --> 01:37:58.862
BRIAN: Animal germs, you have kids, kids are a disease.

2844
01:37:58.862 --> 01:38:00.164
DANI: Sam, give me more to work with.

2845
01:38:00.164 --> 01:38:00.997
BRIAN: Petri dish.

2846
01:38:00.997 --> 01:38:03.196
SAM: Not germs from the dog.

2847
01:38:03.196 --> 01:38:04.673
Germs from you, Brian,

2848
01:38:04.673 --> 01:38:06.902
I know that you pet that dog more than anyone,

2849
01:38:06.902 --> 01:38:09.204
I don't want your, whatever you've got,

2850
01:38:09.204 --> 01:38:10.924
syphilis on your hands

2851
01:38:10.924 --> 01:38:13.381
to transfer somehow to my precious--

2852
01:38:13.381 --> 01:38:14.793
BRIAN: The only thing I want to get to tonight,

2853
01:38:14.793 --> 01:38:17.135
because I'm done with questions for you.

2854
01:38:17.135 --> 01:38:19.254
Cosplay of the Week.

2855
01:38:19.254 --> 01:38:21.142
(cheering)

2856
01:38:21.142 --> 01:38:22.443
DANI: Woo, Cosplay of the Week!

2857
01:38:22.443 --> 01:38:23.360
Look at it!

2858
01:38:25.073 --> 01:38:26.964
So beautiful.

2859
01:38:26.964 --> 01:38:28.381
SAM: It's beautiful.

2860
01:38:29.884 --> 01:38:31.073
BRIAN: Wendy Doodles.

2861
01:38:31.073 --> 01:38:34.724
Our beloved Wendy Sullivan did that.

2862
01:38:34.724 --> 01:38:37.632
Our first winner for Cosplay of the Week

2863
01:38:37.632 --> 01:38:40.215
was sent in by Andy Srivastava.

2864
01:38:41.387 --> 01:38:43.545
SAM: Yep, perfect.

2865
01:38:43.545 --> 01:38:46.953
BRIAN: @Andy_the other thing that I just said.

2867
01:38:49.767 --> 01:38:51.001
Let's take a look.

2868
01:38:51.001 --> 01:38:52.310
The first winner.

2869
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:53.143
Cosplay of the Week.

2870
01:38:53.143 --> 01:38:54.961
(cheering)

2871
01:38:54.961 --> 01:38:56.966
Check out that Fjordo bomb.

2872
01:38:56.966 --> 01:38:59.189
SAM: Yep!

2873
01:38:59.189 --> 01:39:01.329
But it's the snarl that really sells it.

2874
01:39:01.329 --> 01:39:02.788
BRIAN: I would not fight that person.

2875
01:39:02.788 --> 01:39:03.621
LIAM: That scowl.

2876
01:39:03.621 --> 01:39:04.527
BRIAN: I would not fight that person.

2877
01:39:04.527 --> 01:39:07.038
That scowl would make me back down pretty quick.

2878
01:39:07.038 --> 01:39:08.489
DANI: I love all the jade, too.

2879
01:39:08.489 --> 01:39:10.508
LIAM: Yeah, as scary as Marisha Ray.

2880
01:39:10.508 --> 01:39:11.436
BRIAN: And a wonderful,

2881
01:39:11.436 --> 01:39:13.594
wonderfully taken photograph as well.

2882
01:39:13.594 --> 01:39:15.254
SAM: Yeah!

2883
01:39:15.254 --> 01:39:16.225
So High Rollers,

2884
01:39:16.225 --> 01:39:19.356
do you guys all get high and play?

2885
01:39:19.356 --> 01:39:22.523
MARK: He's got it. That's the gimmick.

2886
01:39:23.521 --> 01:39:24.354
SAM: Different drug every week?

2887
01:39:24.354 --> 01:39:25.187
MARK: Yeah, absolutely.

2888
01:39:25.187 --> 01:39:26.645
SAM: Okay, I'm in!

2889
01:39:26.645 --> 01:39:28.196
MARK: We experiment a little bit, you know,

2890
01:39:28.196 --> 01:39:29.905
maybe mix a few things up.

2891
01:39:29.905 --> 01:39:31.337
Bath salts one week and then maybe--

2892
01:39:31.337 --> 01:39:32.170
SAM: Bath salts!

2893
01:39:32.170 --> 01:39:34.057
BRIAN: The mescaline episode was hella weird,

2894
01:39:34.057 --> 01:39:35.537
because they all turned into cows.

2895
01:39:35.537 --> 01:39:37.886
(laughter)

2896
01:39:37.886 --> 01:39:39.356
But going back to what we're talking about,

2897
01:39:39.356 --> 01:39:40.996
what does it mean to be good,

2898
01:39:40.996 --> 01:39:41.945
is the question I think

2899
01:39:41.945 --> 01:39:43.876
we're really getting into in this campaign.

2900
01:39:43.876 --> 01:39:45.265
What does it mean to be good

2901
01:39:45.265 --> 01:39:49.385
and what does that weird gray area look like between,

2902
01:39:49.385 --> 01:39:52.315
because there's the anti-hero archetype,

2903
01:39:52.315 --> 01:39:55.792
but none of you are feeding into that very well.

2904
01:39:55.792 --> 01:39:58.254
So there's, it's a deeper layer to me

2905
01:39:58.254 --> 01:39:59.542
than the anti-hero archetype,

2906
01:39:59.542 --> 01:40:00.375
does that make sense?

2907
01:40:00.375 --> 01:40:01.789
SAM: Yeah, part of what makes you good

2908
01:40:01.789 --> 01:40:04.450
or not good is your own assessment

2909
01:40:04.450 --> 01:40:06.890
of your own goodness.

2910
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:09.620
I mean, how comfortable you are with that.

2911
01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:12.882
BRIAN: Then does that make Caleb the big bad?

2912
01:40:12.882 --> 01:40:14.700
SAM: I, if that were true--

2913
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:16.250
BRIAN: Are you willing to be, are you drunk enough

2914
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:17.802
to let that slip on the air?

2915
01:40:17.802 --> 01:40:19.380
LIAM: I will say, I won't answer that question,

2916
01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:21.191
but I will say, you know we do playlists

2917
01:40:21.191 --> 01:40:24.230
for these characters, and we'll do two or three,

2918
01:40:24.230 --> 01:40:25.751
I think we'll probably end up doing three again,

2919
01:40:25.751 --> 01:40:29.100
and I have this vast bucket of music,

2920
01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:32.962
and it's full of songs that would chart him

2921
01:40:32.962 --> 01:40:34.751
to the worst possible ending

2922
01:40:34.751 --> 01:40:36.980
where he'd leave. I think if he was going to

2923
01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:39.351
have left the campaign, it would've happened already.

2924
01:40:39.351 --> 01:40:40.762
And Matt and I have talked about it.

2925
01:40:40.762 --> 01:40:43.290
I have songs that would have charted that ending for him.

2926
01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:44.123
BRIAN: Wow.

2927
01:40:44.123 --> 01:40:45.151
LIAM: I still haven't because I feel like

2928
01:40:45.151 --> 01:40:46.959
there's still echoes in the back of his head

2929
01:40:46.959 --> 01:40:47.938
whether or not they bubble

2930
01:40:47.938 --> 01:40:49.290
all the way to the forefront.

2931
01:40:49.290 --> 01:40:52.040
[dramatic music]

2932
01:53:03.692 --> 01:53:05.252
MATT: And welcome back.

2933
01:53:05.252 --> 01:53:06.783
So.

2934
01:53:06.783 --> 01:53:11.366
First and foremost, we have our winner of the giveaway.

2935
01:53:12.461 --> 01:53:14.111
The winner of our fantastic

2936
01:53:14.111 --> 01:53:15.143
LAURA: -- delivery.

2937
01:53:15.143 --> 01:53:15.976
MATT: I know.

2938
01:53:15.976 --> 01:53:17.135
Well, there's a lot going on around here.

2939
01:53:17.135 --> 01:53:19.305
I'm easily distracted tonight.

2940
01:53:19.305 --> 01:53:20.964
Didn't get enough iron.

2941
01:53:20.964 --> 01:53:24.797
So the winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway tonight is

2942
01:53:25.988 --> 01:53:27.879
Alejo Laredo.

2943
01:53:28.835 --> 01:53:30.626
Alejo Laredo, congratulations.

2944
01:53:30.626 --> 01:53:32.292
We'll get this to you ASAP.

2945
01:53:32.292 --> 01:53:33.900
Well, done, sir.

2946
01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.335
Indeed.

2947
01:53:35.335 --> 01:53:37.175
And, because I forgot to bring it out here earlier,

2948
01:53:37.175 --> 01:53:39.042
this is the identified sword.

2949
01:53:39.042 --> 01:53:40.459
ALL: Hmm.

2950
01:53:41.644 --> 01:53:44.713
ASHLEY: Um! That's the greatest name.

2951
01:53:44.713 --> 01:53:45.546
TALIESIN: I know.

2952
01:53:45.546 --> 01:53:46.945
LAURA: Oh my god.

2953
01:53:46.945 --> 01:53:48.151
ASHLEY: Can I say it?

2954
01:53:48.151 --> 01:53:49.648
MATT: Yeah, it's your weapon.

2955
01:53:49.648 --> 01:53:51.284
LAURA: Technically Caleb's.

2956
01:53:51.284 --> 01:53:53.804
MATT: Technically Caleb would--
LIAM: DM gave it over, it's fine.

2957
01:53:53.804 --> 01:53:54.637
MATT: I'm sorry.

2958
01:53:54.637 --> 01:53:56.845
TRAVIS: What's the name?

2959
01:53:56.845 --> 01:53:58.137
ASHLEY: It's called a Skingorger.

2960
01:53:58.137 --> 01:53:59.273
SAM: Ooh.

2961
01:53:59.273 --> 01:54:00.106
LIAM: What is it?!

2962
01:54:00.106 --> 01:54:01.326
SAM: Skingorger.

2963
01:54:01.326 --> 01:54:02.646
LIAM: Eww.

2964
01:54:02.646 --> 01:54:03.594
ASHLEY: What does it do?

2965
01:54:03.594 --> 01:54:05.777
TALIESIN: It's pretty rough.

2966
01:54:05.777 --> 01:54:09.189
MARISHA: Skingorger, wielded by Orphan Maker.

2967
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:10.064
SAM: Read it, Yashy.

2968
01:54:10.064 --> 01:54:11.118
LIAM: Skingorger?

2969
01:54:11.118 --> 01:54:13.678
MARISHA: Cousin to Manslaughter

2970
01:54:13.678 --> 01:54:16.820
in the first degree.
SAM: Read it out loud, to the people!

2971
01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:18.609
ASHLEY: (reading) "This massive rust-colored blade

2972
01:54:18.609 --> 01:54:21.049
"was once wielded as a symbol of dominance

2973
01:54:21.049 --> 01:54:26.049
"by the ruling overlord in Igrathad.

01:54:26.099 --> 01:54:28.049

"While attuned to this greatsword,

01:54:42.699 --> 01:54:44.557
"you can't use it again until the next dawn."

2985
01:54:44.557 --> 01:54:45.979
TALIESIN: I mean, it would take you a while

2986
01:54:45.979 --> 01:54:47.480
to recover from that exhaustion anyway.

2987
01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.960
MATT: It's a point of exhaustion, so.

2988
01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:50.833
TRAVIS: Full rest to get rid of a point of exhaustion?

2989
01:54:50.833 --> 01:54:52.005
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2990
01:54:52.005 --> 01:54:53.008
TRAVIS: Once per day you can use that?

2991
01:54:53.008 --> 01:54:53.841
MATT: Yep.

2992
01:54:53.841 --> 01:54:54.674
ASHLEY: Oh gosh.

2993
01:54:54.674 --> 01:54:55.882
TALIESIN: That's a--

2994
01:54:55.882 --> 01:54:56.728
LAURA: It's pretty tight.

2995
01:54:56.728 --> 01:54:57.880
TALIESIN: That's a double-edged sword right there.

2996
01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:00.079
ASHLEY: Does anybody...

2997
01:55:00.079 --> 01:55:01.557
MARISHA: No, that's all you.

2998
01:55:01.557 --> 01:55:02.621
That's you.

2999
01:55:02.621 --> 01:55:03.746
ASHLEY: <i>Pour moi</i>?

3000
01:55:03.746 --> 01:55:04.670
TALIESIN: I mean--

3001
01:55:04.670 --> 01:55:06.610
SAM: But that sword doesn't have the

3002
01:55:06.610 --> 01:55:08.511
Dispel Magic on it.

3003
01:55:08.511 --> 01:55:09.882
MATT: Correct.

3004
01:55:09.882 --> 01:55:12.138
TALIESIN: It's interesting, but.

3005
01:55:12.138 --> 01:55:13.898
SAM: Can someone carry around

3006
01:55:13.898 --> 01:55:16.286
two longswords all the time and like--

3007
01:55:16.286 --> 01:55:19.085
MATT: You have to, you can keep a greatsword with you,

3008
01:55:19.085 --> 01:55:21.394
but only one of the-- you can only use one at a time.

3009
01:55:21.394 --> 01:55:22.227
You can only have--

3010
01:55:22.227 --> 01:55:23.701
MARISHA: Are they both greatswords?

3011
01:55:23.701 --> 01:55:25.379
MATT: Well, technically you could have two attuned.

3012
01:55:25.379 --> 01:55:26.278
You just can't use them--

3013
01:55:26.278 --> 01:55:27.306
TALIESIN: You can't use them both at the same time.

3014
01:55:27.306 --> 01:55:28.739
MATT: At the same time, yeah.

3015
01:55:28.739 --> 01:55:30.849
LIAM: Pick your tool for the day.

3016
01:55:30.849 --> 01:55:31.887
MARISHA: I mean--

3017
01:55:31.887 --> 01:55:33.742
LAURA: It's true, Fjord does use swords.

3018
01:55:33.742 --> 01:55:35.779
TALIESIN: I know how to do this.

3019
01:55:35.779 --> 01:55:37.985
Never mind. That didn't go.

3020
01:55:37.985 --> 01:55:39.835
MATT: You don't get it! Sorry.

3021
01:55:39.835 --> 01:55:42.932
LIAM: It falls into one of those holes.

3022
01:55:42.932 --> 01:55:44.015
The vortex.

3023
01:55:45.614 --> 01:55:47.054
TALIESIN: This is all this trying

3024
01:55:47.054 --> 01:55:48.254
to not think about what's about to happen.

3025
01:55:48.254 --> 01:55:49.144
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know.

3026
01:55:49.144 --> 01:55:50.004
I'm so nervous.

3027
01:55:50.004 --> 01:55:52.004
SAM: Oh yeah, the creepy thing.
LAURA: Oh no!

3028
01:55:52.004 --> 01:55:52.837
MATT: While you're going over that,

3029
01:55:52.837 --> 01:55:53.953
let me go ahead and get the battlefield out.

3030
01:55:53.953 --> 01:55:56.004
(cheering and groaning)

3031
01:55:56.004 --> 01:55:57.625
SAM: Today's battle

3032
01:55:57.625 --> 01:55:58.614
is brought to you by

3033
01:55:58.614 --> 01:56:01.281
the good folks at Dwarven Forge!

3034
01:56:02.145 --> 01:56:04.185
Dwarven Forge has a free download

3035
01:56:04.185 --> 01:56:08.033
of their 406-page Dungeon of Doom module,

3036
01:56:08.033 --> 01:56:11.184
available on their website right now.

3037
01:56:11.184 --> 01:56:13.434
Dwarven Forge, be sure to--

3038
01:56:14.854 --> 01:56:15.687
MARISHA: Oh, it's so close!

3039
01:56:15.687 --> 01:56:17.433
SAM: Be sure to dwarven it up!

3040
01:56:17.433 --> 01:56:18.266
ASHLEY: Oh!

3041
01:56:18.266 --> 01:56:19.099
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3042
01:56:20.124 --> 01:56:20.957
TRAVIS: Ooh!

3043
01:56:20.957 --> 01:56:22.846
ASHLEY: Look at the tree!

3044
01:56:22.846 --> 01:56:24.309
LIAM: Hand that back to our barbarian.

3045
01:56:24.309 --> 01:56:25.778
SAM: Skingorger!

3046
01:56:25.778 --> 01:56:27.413
MATT: These trees are an awesome gift

3047
01:56:27.413 --> 01:56:29.563
from my friend at Hyperion Terrain.

3048
01:56:29.563 --> 01:56:31.230
ALL: Whoa!

3049
01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:32.279
MATT: They sent this to me because

3050
01:56:32.279 --> 01:56:35.083
I've been trying really hard to get

3051
01:56:35.083 --> 01:56:36.294
dead trees for forever,

3052
01:56:36.294 --> 01:56:37.665
and they printed them out for me.

3053
01:56:37.665 --> 01:56:40.239
MATT: Thank you, guys.
ASHLEY: Oh, they're beautiful!

3054
01:56:40.239 --> 01:56:41.397
LIAM: Are those our moorbounders?

3055
01:56:41.397 --> 01:56:42.734
MATT: These are your moorbounders. For the time being,

3056
01:56:42.734 --> 01:56:43.804
these are going to be used as your moorbounders,

3057
01:56:43.804 --> 01:56:44.956
because I don't have moorbounder minis.

3058
01:56:44.956 --> 01:56:45.882
ASHLEY: Big boys!

3059
01:56:45.882 --> 01:56:47.886
(laughter)

3060
01:56:47.886 --> 01:56:49.490
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Big boys!

3061
01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:51.323
MARISHA: Who's a big boisies!

3062
01:56:52.397 --> 01:56:54.715
MATT: So we had Jester and Fjord.

3063
01:56:54.715 --> 01:56:57.166
LAURA: On the front one.

3064
01:56:57.166 --> 01:56:58.326
MATT: Nott had leapt off

3065
01:56:58.326 --> 01:56:59.756
and had gone around the side.

3066
01:56:59.756 --> 01:57:01.097
SAM: Yep, flanking right.

3067
01:57:02.798 --> 01:57:05.985
MATT: Yasha, all right,

3068
01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:08.124
so who else got off of the moorbounders?

3069
01:57:08.124 --> 01:57:09.284
MARISHA: I stepped down.

3070
01:57:09.284 --> 01:57:10.117
LIAM: I stayed on.

3071
01:57:10.117 --> 01:57:11.544
SAM: Nott flanked right.

3072
01:57:11.544 --> 01:57:12.694
MATT: So Beau, you would have been--

3073
01:57:12.694 --> 01:57:13.544
MARISHA: I would be--

3074
01:57:13.544 --> 01:57:15.471
MATT: Who else is in that one?

3075
01:57:15.471 --> 01:57:16.694
LIAM: I'm riding that one,

3076
01:57:16.694 --> 01:57:18.825
but I would prefer to stay on.

3077
01:57:18.825 --> 01:57:19.682
MATT: Okay, so we'll say you're on,

3078
01:57:19.682 --> 01:57:22.021
and we'll say that you're off to the side, there.

3079
01:57:22.021 --> 01:57:24.062
LAURA: Caduceus is riding the other one.

3080
01:57:24.062 --> 01:57:24.895
MATT: With Yasha?

3081
01:57:24.895 --> 01:57:25.728
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3082
01:57:25.728 --> 01:57:26.561
MATT: Okay.

3083
01:57:26.561 --> 01:57:28.873
SAM: Where's the fella?

3084
01:57:28.873 --> 01:57:30.294
MATT: And the fella,

3085
01:57:30.294 --> 01:57:34.945
because there is no mini for this particular individual,

3086
01:57:34.945 --> 01:57:36.444
is right there.

3087
01:57:36.444 --> 01:57:39.768
And began to rush forward to about there.

3088
01:57:39.768 --> 01:57:42.214
SAM: What the fuck?

3089
01:57:42.214 --> 01:57:44.954
MATT: As it shimmies towards you quickly,

3090
01:57:44.954 --> 01:57:46.244
it has the three arms,

3091
01:57:46.244 --> 01:57:47.396
and you watch as two more,

3092
01:57:47.396 --> 01:57:48.521
(flesh bursting)

3093
01:57:48.521 --> 01:57:50.229
stick out of its back.

3094
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:51.381
TRAVIS: Fuck that!

3095
01:57:51.381 --> 01:57:52.820
MATT: For a total of five appendages.

3096
01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:53.653
TRAVIS: No!

3097
01:57:53.653 --> 01:57:54.486
SAM: Five?

3098
01:57:54.486 --> 01:57:55.319
TRAVIS: No!

3099
01:57:55.319 --> 01:57:56.152
SAM: That's the worst number!

3100
01:57:56.152 --> 01:57:57.284
MATT: Let's roll some initiative!

3101
01:57:57.284 --> 01:57:59.462
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

3102
01:57:59.462 --> 01:58:02.934
SAM: Wait, didn't, oh, you got advantage on?

3103
01:58:02.934 --> 01:58:04.017
MARISHA: No, I get a d8.

3104
01:58:05.658 --> 01:58:07.033
Natural 20.

3105
01:58:07.033 --> 01:58:08.614
TALIESIN: That's terrible.

3106
01:58:08.614 --> 01:58:09.447
ASHLEY: Yes!

3107
01:58:09.447 --> 01:58:12.901
MARISHA: Plus four, so 24, plus five, 29!

3108
01:58:12.901 --> 01:58:13.982
SAM: Whoa!

3109
01:58:13.982 --> 01:58:14.815
TRAVIS: Damn.

3110
01:58:14.815 --> 01:58:16.881
MATT: Great. Okay.

3111
01:58:16.881 --> 01:58:18.813
LIAM: That's 21 for me.

3112
01:58:18.813 --> 01:58:19.646
MATT: So.

3113
01:58:19.646 --> 01:58:21.797
Top of the round, 25 to 20.

3114
01:58:21.797 --> 01:58:23.652
MARISHA: 29. Yeah.

3115
01:58:23.652 --> 01:58:24.485
TALIESIN: Jesus.

3116
01:58:24.485 --> 01:58:25.479
ASHLEY: Wow.

3117
01:58:25.479 --> 01:58:27.591
MARISHA: (labored breathing, screaming)

3118
01:58:27.591 --> 01:58:30.220
MATT: (laughs) 25 to 20.

3119
01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:31.369
LIAM: What's that Lonely Island video,

3120
01:58:31.369 --> 01:58:32.420
I don't know why!

3121
01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:34.212
MATT: 20 to 15.

3122
01:58:34.212 --> 01:58:35.367
LAURA: 17.

3123
01:58:35.367 --> 01:58:36.449
ASHLEY: 18.

3124
01:58:36.449 --> 01:58:37.282
TRAVIS: 15.

3125
01:58:37.282 --> 01:58:38.115
MATT: All right.

3126
01:58:38.115 --> 01:58:38.948
Yasha...

3127
01:58:40.588 --> 01:58:41.588
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

3128
01:58:43.769 --> 01:58:45.319
ASHLEY: It's weird having advantage on initiative.

3129
01:58:45.319 --> 01:58:47.559
MATT: All right, 15 to 10.

3130
01:58:47.559 --> 01:58:48.969
TRAVIS: 15 to 10.

3131
01:58:48.969 --> 01:58:50.052
MATT: All righty.

3132
01:58:51.468 --> 01:58:52.301
ASHLEY: Oh god.

3133
01:58:54.759 --> 01:58:55.708
MATT: Ten to five.

3134
01:58:55.708 --> 01:58:56.820
SAM: Nine!

3135
01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:57.653
LIAM: Nine.

3136
01:58:58.688 --> 01:59:02.100
MATT: Oh, Nott and Caleb, going together.

3137
01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:04.812
All right, and...

3138
01:59:04.812 --> 01:59:05.987
Where you at, Caduceus?

3139
01:59:05.987 --> 01:59:06.820
Aww, sorry buddy.

3140
01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:08.153
TALIESIN: Three.

3141
01:59:08.153 --> 01:59:10.103
MATT: All righty. So.

3142
01:59:10.103 --> 01:59:11.259
Top of the round, Beauregard,

3143
01:59:11.259 --> 01:59:12.830
you are up as this creature begins

3144
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:14.441
to rush forward towards you.

3145
01:59:14.441 --> 01:59:16.729
MARISHA: As soon as I see it twitch,

3146
01:59:16.729 --> 01:59:19.354
I twitch quicker than it

3147
01:59:19.354 --> 01:59:20.921
because I've got alacrity,

3148
01:59:20.921 --> 01:59:22.489
and I go: No!

3149
01:59:22.489 --> 01:59:23.889
And I just run.

3150
01:59:23.889 --> 01:59:25.921
Straight--
TRAVIS: Away?

3151
01:59:25.921 --> 01:59:27.032
TALIESIN: Away, away!

3152
01:59:27.032 --> 01:59:28.481
MARISHA: Peace!

3153
01:59:28.481 --> 01:59:29.314
MATT: Up to there?

3154
01:59:29.314 --> 01:59:30.918
MARISHA: Let's do it, yeah.

3155
01:59:30.918 --> 01:59:31.751
MATT: All right, go for it.

3156
01:59:31.751 --> 01:59:33.488
MARISHA: I dart over to it.

3157
01:59:33.488 --> 01:59:34.619
MATT: (groaning)

3158
01:59:34.619 --> 01:59:39.190
MARISHA: I do, start doing a running barrel kick

3159
01:59:39.190 --> 01:59:42.259
to its face. I'm going for it.

3160
01:59:42.259 --> 01:59:44.676
Ah, two attacks, two attacks.

3161
01:59:46.153 --> 01:59:47.830
First two attacks, that's good.

3162
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:50.148
Um, shit.

3163
01:59:50.148 --> 01:59:50.981
Ah.

3164
01:59:51.949 --> 01:59:53.270
Oh, they're both the same.

3165
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:55.312
They're both 23 to hit.

3166
01:59:55.312 --> 01:59:56.895
MATT: Both hit!

3167
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:59.303
SAM: Ooh.

3168
01:59:59.303 --> 02:00:01.951
MARISHA: That's good, too. 12 damage for one,

3169
02:00:01.951 --> 02:00:03.153
and ten damage for the other,

3170
02:00:03.153 --> 02:00:05.051
so 22 hit, pop, pop.

3171
02:00:05.051 --> 02:00:06.041
After that first one,

3172
02:00:06.041 --> 02:00:08.441
I do a stunning strike-sies.

3173
02:00:08.441 --> 02:00:09.771
MATT: All righty.

3174
02:00:11.531 --> 02:00:13.201
That's going to be 15.

3175
02:00:13.201 --> 02:00:15.611
MARISHA: Shit, my save is 15.

3176
02:00:15.611 --> 02:00:18.150
MATT: Aw shit, yeah, so it makes the save.

3177
02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:20.611
MARISHA: (sighs) How do I fix that?

3178
02:00:20.611 --> 02:00:21.444
(whispers) That's a problem!

3179
02:00:21.444 --> 02:00:22.452
MATT: Up your wisdom!

3180
02:00:23.911 --> 02:00:25.368
MARISHA: Do it again, I'm going to do it again.

3181
02:00:25.368 --> 02:00:26.499
Because stun the first time,

3182
02:00:26.499 --> 02:00:28.198
try it again, stun the second time.

3183
02:00:28.198 --> 02:00:29.451
MATT: Okay, so another point for the stun.

3184
02:00:29.451 --> 02:00:31.321
MARISHA: Two points, and I'm trying to stun this bitch.

3185
02:00:31.321 --> 02:00:32.760
MATT: Okay.

3186
02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:34.822
That is a fail.

3187
02:00:34.822 --> 02:00:35.655
MARISHA: He's stunned.

3188
02:00:35.655 --> 02:00:36.582
MATT: He is stunned!

3189
02:00:36.582 --> 02:00:37.593
ASHLEY: Yes.

3190
02:00:37.593 --> 02:00:39.033
Awesome.

3191
02:00:39.033 --> 02:00:39.982
MATT: The second hit--

3192
02:00:39.982 --> 02:00:42.742
TALIESIN: Wear the ring of shame.

3193
02:00:42.742 --> 02:00:43.575
Yeah.

3194
02:00:46.301 --> 02:00:47.313
MATT: All right.

3195
02:00:47.313 --> 02:00:49.813
MARISHA: Two. Okay, and then..

3196
02:00:51.171 --> 02:00:54.004
Ah, fuck it, let's go big or go home.

3197
02:00:55.741 --> 02:00:57.521
One more.

3198
02:00:57.521 --> 02:00:58.854
Flurry of Blows.

3199
02:01:01.283 --> 02:01:02.843
MATT: Get advantage on those attacks, because it's stunned.

3200
02:01:02.843 --> 02:01:04.371
MARISHA: That's right, so that first one

3201
02:01:04.371 --> 02:01:07.203
is a 14, that's 24 to hit for the first one.

3202
02:01:07.203 --> 02:01:08.330
MATT: That hits, woof.

3203
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:11.011
MARISHA: Giving it nine damage,

3204
02:01:11.011 --> 02:01:14.291
and the second one is a 16 to hit, 26.

3205
02:01:15.603 --> 02:01:17.713
Ah, ten damage.

3206
02:01:17.713 --> 02:01:18.713
MATT: All right.

3207
02:01:19.610 --> 02:01:20.603
MARISHA: Good round.

3208
02:01:20.603 --> 02:01:21.902
SAM: Good round!

3209
02:01:21.902 --> 02:01:24.097
TRAVIS: Where's the damn wizard? Oh, there he is.

3210
02:01:24.097 --> 02:01:25.430
MATT: All right, so.

3211
02:01:27.465 --> 02:01:29.835
As the sun has been setting,

3212
02:01:29.835 --> 02:01:32.795
and the area has grown slightly darker,

3213
02:01:32.795 --> 02:01:34.972
as this encounter comes into play,

3214
02:01:34.972 --> 02:01:36.884
this entity, as you're

3215
02:01:36.884 --> 02:01:38.217
unloading on it,

3216
02:01:39.745 --> 02:01:43.283
your blows are glancing and not quite impacting

3217
02:01:43.283 --> 02:01:45.625
as hard as you would hope.

3218
02:01:45.625 --> 02:01:46.458
MARISHA: Okay.

3219
02:01:46.458 --> 02:01:47.791
MATT: With each hit.

3220
02:01:48.734 --> 02:01:49.745
MARISHA: But he's stunned.

3221
02:01:49.745 --> 02:01:50.633
MATT: He is stunned still.

3222
02:01:50.633 --> 02:01:52.683
MARISHA: Okay. All right.

3223
02:01:52.683 --> 02:01:54.705
TRAVIS: Glancing and not landing as hard--

3224
02:01:54.705 --> 02:01:56.334
MATT: (monstrous groaning)

3225
02:01:56.334 --> 02:01:57.390
He's held in place,

3226
02:01:57.390 --> 02:01:58.393
its head swimming,

3227
02:01:58.393 --> 02:02:02.532
and you see its eyes, its white pupil-less eyes

3228
02:02:02.532 --> 02:02:04.520
rolling in its head from the stun.

3229
02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:05.811
MARISHA: Also.

3230
02:02:05.811 --> 02:02:07.303
I hit it with-- sorry.

3231
02:02:07.303 --> 02:02:08.136
Did you want to go ahead?

3232
02:02:08.136 --> 02:02:13.136
I hit it with my, did it give me Extract Aspects?

3233
02:02:13.443 --> 02:02:15.302
MATT: Yes, yes, yes, okay.

3234
02:02:15.302 --> 02:02:17.083
It has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing,

3235
02:02:17.083 --> 02:02:19.811
and slashing while in dim light or darkness.

3236
02:02:19.811 --> 02:02:21.353
LAURA: Oh shit! That's cool.

3237
02:02:22.342 --> 02:02:25.542
MARISHA: As the sun setting,

3238
02:02:25.542 --> 02:02:27.563
we are in dim light.

3239
02:02:27.563 --> 02:02:28.396
MATT: Yes.

3240
02:02:29.483 --> 02:02:30.816
MARISHA: Got it.

3241
02:02:30.816 --> 02:02:32.078
Got it.

3242
02:02:32.078 --> 02:02:33.191
Okay.

3243
02:02:33.191 --> 02:02:37.150
So I quickly shout out,

3244
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:41.830
the darkness makes this guy slippy.

3245
02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:43.473
(laughter)

3246
02:02:43.473 --> 02:02:44.306
TRAVIS: Good, good.

3247
02:02:44.306 --> 02:02:46.330
TALIESIN: Is slippy slang for something?
MARISHA: Slippery.

3248
02:02:46.330 --> 02:02:47.221
MATT: That the end of your turn?

3249
02:02:47.221 --> 02:02:48.924
MARISHA: He's slippy. That ends my turn.

3250
02:02:48.924 --> 02:02:51.099
MATT: All right. Yasha, you're up.

3251
02:02:51.099 --> 02:02:53.783
ASHLEY: Oh shit, that's right, okay, okay, okay.

3252
02:02:53.783 --> 02:02:56.633
I'm going to start, I would like to rage.

3253
02:02:56.633 --> 02:02:57.950
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3254
02:02:57.950 --> 02:03:01.883
ASHLEY: I'm going to start booking it towards--

3255
02:03:01.883 --> 02:03:03.753
MATT: Someone roll for your moorbounders as well,

3256
02:03:03.753 --> 02:03:04.901
if you don't mind.

3257
02:03:04.901 --> 02:03:05.932
MARISHA: Is it all bludgeoning,

3258
02:03:05.932 --> 02:03:07.883
or like, because my fists are magical.

3259
02:03:07.883 --> 02:03:09.613
MATT: Bludgeoning.

3260
02:03:09.613 --> 02:03:11.683
TALIESIN: Was there a plus to that?

3261
02:03:11.683 --> 02:03:12.603
LAURA: Yeah, it's in our--

3262
02:03:12.603 --> 02:03:14.454
TALIESIN: Is there a plus to that?

3263
02:03:14.454 --> 02:03:17.464
Whoever has the moorbounder stat sheet.

3264
02:03:17.464 --> 02:03:19.443
MARISHA: It's got to be Matt, it's got to be Matt.

3265
02:03:19.443 --> 02:03:21.675
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3266
02:03:21.675 --> 02:03:24.515
LAURA: Would it be the dexterity, would it,

3267
02:03:24.515 --> 02:03:27.267
Yeah, I have the moorbounder thing in the--

3268
02:03:27.267 --> 02:03:28.548
MATT: Okay. Perfect.

3269
02:03:28.548 --> 02:03:30.217
LAURA: But it doesn't have an initiative plus.

3270
02:03:30.217 --> 02:03:31.377
MATT: It'd be its dexterity bonus.

3271
02:03:31.377 --> 02:03:33.044
LAURA: Dexterity. No bump.

3272
02:03:33.044 --> 02:03:34.376
TALIESIN: 12.

3273
02:03:34.376 --> 02:03:37.126
LAURA: 15 for Yarnball.

3274
02:03:37.126 --> 02:03:38.965
SAM: 17 for Jannik.

3275
02:03:38.965 --> 02:03:39.907
MATT: Well, they all go at once,

3276
02:03:39.907 --> 02:03:42.227
so whatever you rolled is what they go as.

3277
02:03:42.227 --> 02:03:43.060
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.

3278
02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:44.497
MATT: Otherwise, we have three other

3279
02:03:44.497 --> 02:03:45.546
initiatives to worry about.

3280
02:03:45.546 --> 02:03:46.379
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh.

3281
02:03:46.379 --> 02:03:49.298
TALIESIN: 15.
LAURA: 15, that's a nice in-between.

3282
02:03:49.298 --> 02:03:50.406
MATT: Got it. Sorry.

3283
02:03:50.406 --> 02:03:52.406
Yasha, you have raged.

3284
02:03:52.406 --> 02:03:53.486
What are you going to do?

3285
02:03:53.486 --> 02:03:57.369
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to start booking it

3286
02:03:57.369 --> 02:03:58.367
towards this creature.

3287
02:03:58.367 --> 02:04:00.217
MATT: You leap off the moorbounder,

3288
02:04:00.217 --> 02:04:03.747
we'll say, (counting)

3289
02:04:03.747 --> 02:04:06.777
30, 35, 40, that's your movement there.

3290
02:04:06.777 --> 02:04:09.110
ASHLEY: Okay, so I guess I'll take

3291
02:04:10.597 --> 02:04:11.430
the rest.

3292
02:04:16.721 --> 02:04:17.554
Yeah.

3293
02:04:17.554 --> 02:04:20.139
I'll dash the rest of the way.

3294
02:04:20.139 --> 02:04:21.939
I want to get to him.

3295
02:04:21.939 --> 02:04:23.091
MATT: You dash up,

3296
02:04:23.091 --> 02:04:24.745
and with your dashing, you actually get

3297
02:04:24.745 --> 02:04:26.499
on the other side to flank, in case you want to--

3298
02:04:26.499 --> 02:04:27.332
ASHLEY: Okay, great.

3299
02:04:27.332 --> 02:04:28.771
MATT: You move around, blade at the ready.

3300
02:04:28.771 --> 02:04:30.099
The Skingorger by the way, just to describe it,

3301
02:04:30.099 --> 02:04:31.670
doesn't have a hilt.

3302
02:04:31.670 --> 02:04:34.891
It's one large, solid, rust-colored blade

3303
02:04:34.891 --> 02:04:36.961
with two handles on the back of it,

3304
02:04:36.961 --> 02:04:37.910
so it looks like you're,

3305
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:39.587
there's not a handle and a hilt,

3306
02:04:39.587 --> 02:04:41.819
it's like you're clutching two open handles

3307
02:04:41.819 --> 02:04:44.321
on the back of one big, solid glaive.

3308
02:04:44.321 --> 02:04:45.321
SAM: Cool.

3309
02:04:45.321 --> 02:04:47.529
ASHLEY: That's so cool!

3310
02:04:48.418 --> 02:04:49.398
MARISHA: Gnarly.

3311
02:04:49.398 --> 02:04:53.409
ASHLEY: (aggressive groaning) I love this blade!

3312
02:04:53.409 --> 02:04:55.026
MATT: That's the end of your turn?

3313
02:04:55.026 --> 02:04:56.912
That's your movement, action, bonus, yeah.

3314
02:04:56.912 --> 02:04:58.045
All right, Jester, you're up next.

3315
02:04:58.045 --> 02:04:58.898
Fjord, you're on deck.

3316
02:04:58.898 --> 02:05:00.372
LAURA: Okay.

3317
02:05:00.372 --> 02:05:04.179
I'm going to Guiding Bolt this creature.

3318
02:05:04.179 --> 02:05:05.321
MATT: Go for it, you have an advantage on the attack.

3319
02:05:05.321 --> 02:05:06.890
LAURA: At 2nd-level!

3320
02:05:06.890 --> 02:05:08.223
MATT: Go for it.

3321
02:05:10.867 --> 02:05:13.851
LAURA: Thank god I had advantage. Holy shit.

3322
02:05:13.851 --> 02:05:15.350
Guiding Bolt.

3323
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:18.451
Plus nine is 24!

3324
02:05:18.451 --> 02:05:20.171
MATT: 24 hits, roll damage.

3325
02:05:20.171 --> 02:05:21.281
LAURA: Yay!

3326
02:05:21.281 --> 02:05:22.668
That's 5d6.

3327
02:05:22.668 --> 02:05:26.283
TALIESIN: It's okay. It took me a second.

3328
02:05:26.283 --> 02:05:27.968
This is going to make me nervous.
LAURA: Woo!

3329
02:05:27.968 --> 02:05:32.350
18, 21, 23!

3330
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:34.430
MATT: 23, oof!

3331
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:37.609
As it slams into the creature,

3332
02:05:37.609 --> 02:05:39.699
the burning, radiant energy

3333
02:05:39.699 --> 02:05:41.571
courses across its torso and head,

3334
02:05:41.571 --> 02:05:43.499
the skin peeling back.

3335
02:05:43.499 --> 02:05:45.410
It's looking hurt.

3336
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:46.520
LAURA: Okay.

3337
02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:48.979
In case he needs a double advantage.

3338
02:05:48.979 --> 02:05:50.312
MATT: There you go.

3339
02:05:50.312 --> 02:05:51.270
All right, that finishes your turn.

3340
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:53.231
You going to move or stay where you are?

3341
02:05:53.231 --> 02:05:54.980
LAURA: I'm going to stay on Yarnball.

3342
02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:56.996
MATT: Okay, so you're still on Yarnball? All right.

3343
02:05:56.996 --> 02:05:58.513
That brings us to Fjord.

3344
02:05:58.513 --> 02:06:01.203
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll use my 30 feet of movement

3345
02:06:01.203 --> 02:06:03.833
to run up the map.

3346
02:06:03.833 --> 02:06:06.323
MATT: You leap off the moorbounder.

3347
02:06:06.323 --> 02:06:07.741
Five, ten, 15, 20.

3348
02:06:07.741 --> 02:06:08.673
TRAVIS: Actually, not towards it,

3349
02:06:08.673 --> 02:06:10.660
towards this area if I can.

3350
02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:11.660
MATT: All right.

3351
02:06:12.851 --> 02:06:14.873
That'll get you 30 right there.

3352
02:06:14.873 --> 02:06:16.331
TRAVIS: Anything I see over there

3353
02:06:16.331 --> 02:06:20.602
before I turn my attention to Blade Hands?

3354
02:06:20.602 --> 02:06:21.802
MATT: You're using your action to look?

3355
02:06:21.802 --> 02:06:22.891
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't want to use my action to look,

3356
02:06:22.891 --> 02:06:26.961
I'll send two Eldritch Blasts towards that creature,

3357
02:06:26.961 --> 02:06:28.592
but I just wanted to be there.

3358
02:06:28.592 --> 02:06:31.801
MATT: All right, let me see over here.

3359
02:06:31.801 --> 02:06:32.968
Actually, yes.

3360
02:06:34.683 --> 02:06:35.516
You see another one of these--

3361
02:06:35.516 --> 02:06:38.142
LAURA and SAM: Oh no!

3362
02:06:38.142 --> 02:06:42.460
MATT: Just risen up from behind like, (moaning)

3363
02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:43.491
TALIESIN: Yep, yep, yep.

3364
02:06:43.491 --> 02:06:44.332
TRAVIS: Fuck that. You don't need to

3365
02:06:44.332 --> 02:06:45.771
make the noise every time.

3366
02:06:45.771 --> 02:06:50.222
I will send two Eldritch Blasts towards that new friend.

3367
02:06:50.222 --> 02:06:52.003
MATT: All right, go for it.

3368
02:06:52.003 --> 02:06:55.586
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast!

3369
02:06:57.100 --> 02:07:00.011
One of them is a 26.

3370
02:07:00.011 --> 02:07:00.844
MATT: That hits.

3371
02:07:00.844 --> 02:07:02.249
TRAVIS: The other one is a 13.

3372
02:07:02.249 --> 02:07:03.163
MATT: 13 misses.

3373
02:07:03.163 --> 02:07:04.971
You see it go, ah!

3374
02:07:04.971 --> 02:07:06.939
Fire both out, one goes wide and

3375
02:07:06.939 --> 02:07:08.923
blasts into one of the nearby rocks off to the side.

3376
02:07:08.923 --> 02:07:10.353
TRAVIS: Accurate, that's accurate.

3377
02:07:10.353 --> 02:07:14.031
That is 13 points of Eldritch Blast dam-age!

3378
02:07:14.031 --> 02:07:16.611
MATT: 13 points, you got it.

3379
02:07:16.611 --> 02:07:17.444
All righty.

3380
02:07:17.444 --> 02:07:18.917
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action

3381
02:07:18.917 --> 02:07:22.225
to cast Hex on that motherfucker.

3382
02:07:23.134 --> 02:07:24.134
TALIESIN: A hex man.

3383
02:07:25.612 --> 02:07:26.753
MATT: Is hex an action or bonus action?

3384
02:07:26.753 --> 02:07:28.660
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, Hexblade's Curse.

3385
02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:31.071
MATT: Hexblade's Curse, got it!

3386
02:07:31.071 --> 02:07:32.537
Got it.

3387
02:07:33.862 --> 02:07:35.763
(muttering) Getting these filled out here.

3388
02:07:35.763 --> 02:07:37.532
There it is.

3389
02:07:37.532 --> 02:07:38.913
Hexblade's Curse.

3390
02:07:38.913 --> 02:07:40.814
LIAM: Do we have to roll moorbounder initiative?

3391
02:07:40.814 --> 02:07:42.062
MATT: They already did, yeah.

3392
02:07:42.062 --> 02:07:42.895
LIAM: Oh you did it for us?

3393
02:07:42.895 --> 02:07:43.728
MATT: She did it.

3394
02:07:43.728 --> 02:07:45.092
LIAM: Oh okay, great.

3395
02:07:45.092 --> 02:07:46.342
MATT: All right, so.

3396
02:07:46.342 --> 02:07:47.550
TRAVIS: That's it.

3397
02:07:47.550 --> 02:07:49.582
I'll yell out, (garbled yell)

3398
02:07:49.582 --> 02:07:51.751
MATT: Okay! (laughs)

3399
02:07:51.751 --> 02:07:53.771
The already darkened corner of that area over there

3400
02:07:53.771 --> 02:07:55.742
blocked by the light, the shadows get darker around it

3401
02:07:55.742 --> 02:07:57.769
as the curse wraps itself

3402
02:07:57.769 --> 02:07:59.761
like tentacles, like, (gooey splashing)

3403
02:07:59.761 --> 02:08:01.781
goes across the creature.

3404
02:08:01.781 --> 02:08:03.713
After being struck, it looks back at you.

3405
02:08:03.713 --> 02:08:05.451
(raspy breathing)

3406
02:08:05.451 --> 02:08:07.451
It's now their turn.

3407
02:08:09.262 --> 02:08:13.041
From this nearby tree, you start hearing

3408
02:08:13.041 --> 02:08:15.638
dozens and dozens of tiny squeaks.

3409
02:08:15.638 --> 02:08:17.529
(squeaking)

3410
02:08:17.529 --> 02:08:18.641
TALIESIN: Oh no.

3411
02:08:18.641 --> 02:08:22.582
MATT: You watch as a series of bats all, (flapping)

3412
02:08:22.582 --> 02:08:23.462
descend from the tree towards

3413
02:08:23.462 --> 02:08:26.290
the brightest color in the vicinity.

3414
02:08:26.290 --> 02:08:27.931
Caduceus.

3415
02:08:27.931 --> 02:08:29.302
From the top of this tree.

3416
02:08:29.302 --> 02:08:31.222
TRAVIS: Okay.

3417
02:08:31.222 --> 02:08:33.936
MATT: Swarm of bats descends on you

3418
02:08:33.936 --> 02:08:37.427
from the top, that's going to be

3419
02:08:37.427 --> 02:08:38.726
19 to hit.

3420
02:08:38.726 --> 02:08:40.950
TALIESIN: That hits.

3421
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:42.099
MATT: That hits, okay.

3422
02:08:42.099 --> 02:08:43.967
Not bad for a plus one.

3423
02:08:43.967 --> 02:08:45.967
All right, so you take--

3424
02:08:52.525 --> 02:08:55.807
LAURA: Would the creature that we're attacking,

3425
02:08:55.807 --> 02:08:57.577
that I've hit with the Guiding Bolt,

3426
02:08:57.577 --> 02:09:02.105
he's glittering with a mystical dim light now, just--

3427
02:09:02.105 --> 02:09:03.335
MATT: Yeah, mystical dim light.

3428
02:09:03.335 --> 02:09:04.168
He's in dim light.

3429
02:09:04.168 --> 02:09:06.393
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.
LAURA: All right.

3430
02:09:06.393 --> 02:09:07.765
MATT: Take five points piercing damage.

3431
02:09:07.765 --> 02:09:09.691
LAURA: (laughs)

3432
02:09:09.691 --> 02:09:10.608
TALIESIN: Cool, cool.

3433
02:09:11.879 --> 02:09:13.660
MATT: They're swarming around you right now,

3434
02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:15.260
they're squeaking, they're scraping at you,

3435
02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:18.580
biting at you, and you're trying to shake them off.

3436
02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:19.413
TALIESIN: Not cool.

3437
02:09:19.413 --> 02:09:20.246
MATT: All right.

3438
02:09:20.246 --> 02:09:22.082
That guy over there is stunned.

3439
02:09:22.082 --> 02:09:24.689
This guy over here who's behind the rock,

3440
02:09:24.689 --> 02:09:25.740
after being blasted in the chest,

3441
02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:27.426
was going to climb through that opening

3442
02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:30.209
and instead turns and goes, (groaning) (skittering)

3443
02:09:30.209 --> 02:09:31.178
and skitters towards you--

3444
02:09:31.178 --> 02:09:32.016
(screaming)

3445
02:09:32.016 --> 02:09:32.849
TRAVIS: Stop, man!

3446
02:09:32.849 --> 02:09:33.748
LAURA: Why'd you do that?

3447
02:09:33.748 --> 02:09:35.108
MATT: Because it's fun.

3448
02:09:35.108 --> 02:09:36.627
Runs past over here.

3449
02:09:36.627 --> 02:09:37.508
LAURA: Oh god.

3450
02:09:37.508 --> 02:09:39.538
MATT: Is going to take its

3451
02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:42.508
multi-attack arm spikes at you.

3452
02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:44.607
SAM: He's going out on a limb.

3453
02:09:44.607 --> 02:09:45.440
MATT: Oof.

3454
02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:47.407
(groaning)

3455
02:09:47.407 --> 02:09:49.181
ASHLEY: Very good.
MATT: (laughs) 18 to hit.

3456
02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:50.014
TRAVIS: Hits.

3457
02:09:50.014 --> 02:09:50.847
MATT: Hits you.

3458
02:09:50.847 --> 02:09:51.796
And the--

3459
02:09:51.796 --> 02:09:52.676
MARISHA: We appreciate puns.

3460
02:09:52.676 --> 02:09:54.176
You all know this.

3461
02:09:55.778 --> 02:09:57.554
TRAVIS: Dirty, dirty puns.

3462
02:09:57.554 --> 02:09:58.629
SAM: Devoted to them.
MARISHA: All puns.

3463
02:09:58.629 --> 02:10:01.633
LIAM: Take away the puns, there's really not much left.

3464
02:10:01.633 --> 02:10:03.874
MATT: Sorry. Instead of the arm spike,

3465
02:10:03.874 --> 02:10:05.495
it's going to make an embrace.

3466
02:10:05.495 --> 02:10:06.328
TRAVIS: Okay.

3467
02:10:06.328 --> 02:10:08.005
MATT: Instead, it comes forward towards you,

3468
02:10:08.005 --> 02:10:09.823
both of its arms out,

3469
02:10:09.823 --> 02:10:11.994
and pierces them through your body

3470
02:10:11.994 --> 02:10:13.525
and pulls you in toward it,

3471
02:10:13.525 --> 02:10:15.731
all the arms, (piercing)

3472
02:10:15.731 --> 02:10:17.844
wrapping around you like a spider trapping its prey.

3473
02:10:17.844 --> 02:10:20.143
Now you're pressed up against it,

3474
02:10:20.143 --> 02:10:21.575
all you can see is its bright eye

3475
02:10:21.575 --> 02:10:24.781
and its mouth open just, (groaning).

3476
02:10:24.781 --> 02:10:27.802
Pulling you as close to the creature as you possibly can.

3477
02:10:27.802 --> 02:10:31.593
TRAVIS: Nope. The worst person to happen to!

3478
02:10:31.593 --> 02:10:32.426
SAM: Wow.

3479
02:10:32.426 --> 02:10:34.932
MATT: Just loudly screaming in your ear.

3480
02:10:34.932 --> 02:10:36.972
This horrible wail.

3481
02:10:36.972 --> 02:10:37.805
You take

3482
02:10:42.525 --> 02:10:45.970
20, sorry, 31 points of piercing damage

3483
02:10:46.982 --> 02:10:48.171
and you are grappled.

3484
02:10:48.171 --> 02:10:49.396
TRAVIS: Copy that.

3485
02:10:49.396 --> 02:10:50.229
MARISHA: What.

3486
02:10:52.575 --> 02:10:54.585
TRAVIS: Grappled, condition.

3487
02:10:54.585 --> 02:10:55.585
SAM: 31 points?

3488
02:10:56.433 --> 02:10:57.764
TALIESIN: That's a lot of damage.

3489
02:10:57.764 --> 02:10:58.597
SAM: Wow.

3490
02:10:58.597 --> 02:11:00.904
MATT: You're also frightened

3491
02:11:00.904 --> 02:11:02.425
while you are in its grasp.

3492
02:11:02.425 --> 02:11:03.746
TRAVIS: Grappled and frightened.
MATT: Yes.

3493
02:11:03.746 --> 02:11:05.612
TRAVIS: Damn, okay.
MATT: While it's holding you,

3494
02:11:05.612 --> 02:11:07.646
you feel its mournful wail

3495
02:11:07.646 --> 02:11:09.984
just shaking your soul

3496
02:11:09.984 --> 02:11:11.985
at its very deepest level.

3497
02:11:11.985 --> 02:11:12.818
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3498
02:11:12.818 --> 02:11:15.694
MATT: It's pulling you closer and closer towards it.

3499
02:11:15.694 --> 02:11:18.345
That ends its turn, the one that's stunned

3500
02:11:18.345 --> 02:11:19.678
remains stunned.

3501
02:11:20.614 --> 02:11:24.374
And out from this side.

3502
02:11:24.374 --> 02:11:25.924
SAM: Oh god.

3503
02:11:27.222 --> 02:11:29.433
MATT: Got a, (wailing)

3504
02:11:29.433 --> 02:11:31.073
Higher pitch comes rushing this way.

3505
02:11:31.073 --> 02:11:31.906
SAM: No!

3506
02:11:32.902 --> 02:11:34.069
MATT: Five, six...

3507
02:11:35.817 --> 02:11:37.844
One, two, three, four,

3508
02:11:37.844 --> 02:11:39.264
it can't take any actions

3509
02:11:39.264 --> 02:11:40.895
but it rushes right up to you, Caleb.

3510
02:11:40.895 --> 02:11:42.474
(shuffling, groaning)

3511
02:11:42.474 --> 02:11:44.571
Its claws are out trying to reach towards you.

3512
02:11:44.571 --> 02:11:45.404
LIAM: I don't know if it helps at all,

3513
02:11:45.404 --> 02:11:46.726
but I'm on the moorbounder.

3514
02:11:46.726 --> 02:11:47.559
MATT: Correct.

3515
02:11:47.559 --> 02:11:48.606
But it's reaching, it's trying

3516
02:11:48.606 --> 02:11:50.774
to harry you towards the creature.

3517
02:11:50.774 --> 02:11:53.504
It's now the moorbounders' turn.

3518
02:11:53.504 --> 02:11:54.763
LAURA: Do we each control our own?

3519
02:11:54.763 --> 02:11:56.583
MATT: You guys control your moorbounders.

3520
02:11:56.583 --> 02:11:58.894
LAURA: Oh, right, and do we have to roll for--

3521
02:11:58.894 --> 02:12:00.734
SAM: You can only make them sit and stay.

3522
02:12:00.734 --> 02:12:02.403
(laughter)

3523
02:12:02.403 --> 02:12:03.304
LAURA: Okay.

3524
02:12:03.304 --> 02:12:04.580
TALIESIN: I have my moorbounder attack the bats

3525
02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:06.079
that are swarming around.

3526
02:12:06.079 --> 02:12:07.222
MATT: Okay.

3527
02:12:07.222 --> 02:12:08.871
LAURA: I'm going to have mine go up

3528
02:12:08.871 --> 02:12:10.990
and attack the one that's

3529
02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:12.622
holding onto Fjord.

3530
02:12:12.622 --> 02:12:13.455
MATT: Okay.

3531
02:12:14.523 --> 02:12:16.662
LAURA: It can attack with its hooves, it says.

3532
02:12:16.662 --> 02:12:18.670
Its claw, it's a--

3533
02:12:18.670 --> 02:12:20.861
SAM: Oh, it's a modified horse, got it.

3534
02:12:20.861 --> 02:12:22.867
It's a claw attack.

3535
02:12:22.867 --> 02:12:26.569
MATT: Yes, that, it doesn't have a large array of attacks.

3536
02:12:26.569 --> 02:12:28.660
Go ahead and roll against the bats.

3537
02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:31.447
TALIESIN: All right, what's the plus to attack, by the way?

3538
02:12:31.447 --> 02:12:32.364
LAURA and TALIESIN: Plus six.

3539
02:12:33.622 --> 02:12:35.679
TALIESIN: Oh, that's 24.

3540
02:12:35.679 --> 02:12:36.972
MATT: Yeah, roll damage.

3541
02:12:36.972 --> 02:12:38.055
TALIESIN: That's a...

3542
02:12:40.123 --> 02:12:42.386
LAURA: 2d4 plus four.

3543
02:12:42.386 --> 02:12:43.969
TALIESIN: 2d4 plus four.

3544
02:12:44.924 --> 02:12:47.818
What's its category, Matt, do you know?

3545
02:12:47.818 --> 02:12:50.070
Beast, companion, familiar, Wild Shape, mount, summoned?

3546
02:12:50.070 --> 02:12:51.445
TALIESIN: Seven points.

3547
02:12:51.445 --> 02:12:53.027
MATT: Seven points, nice.

3548
02:12:56.051 --> 02:12:59.022
It takes not a whole lot of damage,

3549
02:12:59.022 --> 02:13:00.447
as it's striking at a swarm of bats.

3550
02:13:00.447 --> 02:13:01.927
One or two bats get knocked to the ground,

3551
02:13:01.927 --> 02:13:03.588
but it's still a large cloud

3552
02:13:03.588 --> 02:13:04.727
and it's going to take a lot more

3553
02:13:04.727 --> 02:13:06.469
to carve through them.

3554
02:13:06.469 --> 02:13:07.737
That's your moorbounder's turn.

3555
02:13:07.737 --> 02:13:08.570
Staying put?

3556
02:13:08.570 --> 02:13:09.679
TALIESIN: The warbounder?

3557
02:13:09.679 --> 02:13:10.728
MATT: Yes.

3558
02:13:10.728 --> 02:13:12.587
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think it's interested

3559
02:13:12.587 --> 02:13:14.856
in the bats right now it feels like.

3560
02:13:14.856 --> 02:13:15.947
MATT: For yours, Jester.

3561
02:13:15.947 --> 02:13:18.373
LAURA: Mine is going to run up and try to

3562
02:13:18.373 --> 02:13:21.089
get the one that's attacking Fjord.

3563
02:13:21.089 --> 02:13:22.264
Going to rear back

3564
02:13:22.264 --> 02:13:24.099
and bring his claws down.

3565
02:13:24.099 --> 02:13:26.349
MATT: Go ahead and roll attack.

3566
02:13:27.477 --> 02:13:29.193
SAM: Don't hit Fjord.

3567
02:13:29.193 --> 02:13:30.026
LAURA: Oh good.

3568
02:13:30.026 --> 02:13:32.119
16 plus nine, six plus six.

3569
02:13:32.119 --> 02:13:33.761
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

3570
02:13:33.761 --> 02:13:34.594
LAURA: Okay.

3571
02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:38.630
SAM and LAURA: Ooh!

3572
02:13:38.630 --> 02:13:39.990
LAURA: 11 points!

3573
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.823
MATT: Nice.

3574
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:45.077
LAURA: (moorbounder cries)

3575
02:13:45.077 --> 02:13:46.243
Yarnball sounds lame,

3576
02:13:46.243 --> 02:13:47.718
but it's really tough.

3577
02:13:47.718 --> 02:13:48.819
MATT: Because of the shaded space,

3578
02:13:48.819 --> 02:13:51.670
the damage doesn't do as much attack as you would hope.

3579
02:13:51.670 --> 02:13:54.190
As a reaction, it's going to use its tightening embrace.

3580
02:13:54.190 --> 02:13:56.150
SAM: Tightening embrace?

3581
02:13:56.150 --> 02:13:58.179
MATT: As it gets hit, (groaning)

3582
02:13:58.179 --> 02:14:02.072
it wails louder and crushes onto Fjord even harder.

3583
02:14:02.072 --> 02:14:05.586
TRAVIS: No, no, bad move, bad move!

3584
02:14:05.586 --> 02:14:07.027
MARISHA: You look like you need a hug!

3585
02:14:07.027 --> 02:14:08.329
(laughter)

3586
02:14:08.329 --> 02:14:11.323
MATT: You take 17 points psychic damage.

3587
02:14:11.323 --> 02:14:13.433
(groaning)

3588
02:14:13.433 --> 02:14:15.363
TRAVIS: Just from the, (crushing)

3589
02:14:15.363 --> 02:14:17.014
MATT: As it's pulling you in and screaming in you,

3590
02:14:17.014 --> 02:14:18.414
it's shaking through your brain

3591
02:14:18.414 --> 02:14:20.544
and that fear that's inside you right now

3592
02:14:20.544 --> 02:14:23.723
is getting more and more painful.

3593
02:14:23.723 --> 02:14:25.953
LIAM: That thing's crushing on you like an elven pirate.

3594
02:14:25.953 --> 02:14:27.254
MATT: There you go.

3595
02:14:27.254 --> 02:14:29.113
All right, and,

3596
02:14:29.113 --> 02:14:32.769
Caleb, you're last. Moorbounder.

3597
02:14:32.769 --> 02:14:35.185
LIAM: I yank their harnesses to the right

3598
02:14:35.185 --> 02:14:37.993
and say <i>Tod</i>, which means "death" in Zemnian.

3599
02:14:37.993 --> 02:14:39.035
Attack this one.

3600
02:14:39.035 --> 02:14:41.176
MATT: Okay, roll attack.

3601
02:14:41.176 --> 02:14:43.647
SAM: You said it's resistant to piercing damage?

3602
02:14:43.647 --> 02:14:46.080
MARISHA: Piercing, bludgeoning, slashing.
LIAM: 18 to hit.

3603
02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.692
MATT: 18 to hit, hits.

3604
02:14:47.692 --> 02:14:49.096
LIAM: Okay.

3605
02:14:49.096 --> 02:14:53.457
MARISHA: Including magical, if it's in dim or dark light.

3606
02:14:53.457 --> 02:14:54.806
So light--

3607
02:14:54.806 --> 02:14:56.046
LIAM: Just six for that one.

3608
02:14:56.046 --> 02:14:56.879
MATT: All right.

3609
02:14:56.879 --> 02:15:00.937
TALIESIN: I could blow something crazy again...

3610
02:15:00.937 --> 02:15:02.907
MATT: All right, you got it.

3611
02:15:02.907 --> 02:15:04.507
Strikes through and claws,

3612
02:15:04.507 --> 02:15:06.366
doesn't do as much damage as you hope, once again,

3613
02:15:06.366 --> 02:15:09.949
they are in this shaded dusk space,

3614
02:15:11.005 --> 02:15:13.745
they're empowered by the nearby shadow.

3615
02:15:13.745 --> 02:15:16.507
All right, that ends your turn, Caleb.

3616
02:15:16.507 --> 02:15:17.340
LIAM: That was the moorbounder.

3617
02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:18.177
MATT: That's right, moorbounders' turn.

3618
02:15:18.177 --> 02:15:19.273
I mean, moorbounder, is it going to move,

3619
02:15:19.273 --> 02:15:20.106
is it going to stay?

3620
02:15:20.106 --> 02:15:20.939
LIAM: It's going to stay.

3621
02:15:20.939 --> 02:15:22.638
MATT: Okay. That brings us now to Nott and Caleb,

3622
02:15:22.638 --> 02:15:24.171
what are you guys doing?

3623
02:15:24.171 --> 02:15:25.147
LIAM: Yeah.

3624
02:15:25.147 --> 02:15:27.526
The driftglobe says I can light that thing up

3625
02:15:27.526 --> 02:15:29.398
and then says you can speak another command word

3626
02:15:29.398 --> 02:15:30.976
as an action to make it rise.

3627
02:15:30.976 --> 02:15:34.987
Does that mean lighting it up as a free action?

3628
02:15:34.987 --> 02:15:36.241
MATT: Let me see that again?

3629
02:15:36.241 --> 02:15:37.905
LIAM: It doesn't mention action on the first part of

3630
02:15:37.905 --> 02:15:39.115
lighting it up.

3631
02:15:39.115 --> 02:15:43.948
Then says, you can then do an action to make it float.

3632
02:15:47.374 --> 02:15:49.457
MATT: Speak its command word.

3633
02:15:52.254 --> 02:15:54.945
No, I'd say you can just speak the word.

3634
02:15:54.945 --> 02:15:56.274
LIAM: Speak the word?
MATT: Yeah.

3635
02:15:56.274 --> 02:15:58.334
LIAM: Then I pull the driftglobe out

3636
02:15:58.334 --> 02:15:59.454
and hold it up in the air

3637
02:15:59.454 --> 02:16:03.143
and say "fajar," and there is daylight

3638
02:16:03.143 --> 02:16:04.625
streaming all around us.

3639
02:16:04.625 --> 02:16:05.945
MATT: All right, so.

3640
02:16:05.945 --> 02:16:07.675
LIAM: 60 feet in every direction.

3641
02:16:07.675 --> 02:16:08.963
MATT: That will encompass everything.

3642
02:16:08.963 --> 02:16:12.046
As the orb is pulled out by Caleb.

3643
02:16:14.956 --> 02:16:17.203
LIAM: I didn't make it up, it's on the card.

3644
02:16:17.203 --> 02:16:19.585
For my action, I will take out some--

3645
02:16:19.585 --> 02:16:20.635
MATT: Well, the globe is put away,

3646
02:16:20.635 --> 02:16:21.545
you had to pull it out to use it.

3647
02:16:21.545 --> 02:16:22.378
SAM: Oh yes.

3648
02:16:23.495 --> 02:16:25.019
LIAM: Okay.

3649
02:16:25.019 --> 02:16:26.230
MATT: I'm saying, if the globe wasn't at the ready,

3650
02:16:26.230 --> 02:16:28.225
you'd have to reach in and pull it out

3651
02:16:28.225 --> 02:16:29.525
and then say the command word.

3652
02:16:29.525 --> 02:16:30.358
I'd say that'd probably be an action to do all that.

3653
02:16:30.358 --> 02:16:31.651
Because it's using an object, technically.

3654
02:16:31.651 --> 02:16:32.519
LIAM: Cool, cool.

3655
02:16:32.519 --> 02:16:33.352
MATT: Mmkay, so that's your action.

3656
02:16:33.352 --> 02:16:35.230
Do you want to move or stay where you are?

3657
02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:37.390
LIAM: No, I want to stay on the moorbounder.

3658
02:16:37.390 --> 02:16:38.529
MATT: Okay.

3659
02:16:38.529 --> 02:16:40.369
You do watch as the globe begins

3660
02:16:40.369 --> 02:16:42.070
to emit this bright, bright light

3661
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:43.110
that encompasses the area,

3662
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:44.449
the creatures, (groaning)

3663
02:16:44.449 --> 02:16:45.649
begin to shrink away from it.

3664
02:16:45.649 --> 02:16:49.270
Previously the tough, gray hide that they had

3665
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:51.521
begins to crack on the exterior,

3666
02:16:51.521 --> 02:16:53.379
seemingly affected by the presence

3667
02:16:53.379 --> 02:16:55.629
of very bright light.

3668
02:16:56.921 --> 02:16:58.588
That finishes your turn, Caleb.

3669
02:16:58.588 --> 02:16:59.421
Nott, what are you doing?

3670
02:16:59.421 --> 02:17:02.878
SAM: I will (shoonk) around the back, here,

3671
02:17:02.878 --> 02:17:04.630
of the volume, yep.

3672
02:17:04.630 --> 02:17:05.463
MATT: All right.

3673
02:17:05.463 --> 02:17:08.158
SAM: I'm getting within 30 feet of the thing,

3674
02:17:08.158 --> 02:17:10.230
watched that it's got Fjord,

3675
02:17:10.230 --> 02:17:11.350
and I will attack!

3676
02:17:11.350 --> 02:17:12.183
MATT: Go for it.

3677
02:17:12.183 --> 02:17:14.859
SAM: With the Tinkertop Boltblaster Crossbow!

3678
02:17:14.859 --> 02:17:17.857
(laughter)

3679
02:17:17.857 --> 02:17:19.478
29 to hit!

3680
02:17:19.478 --> 02:17:20.311
MATT: That'll hit!

3681
02:17:20.311 --> 02:17:21.144
TRAVIS: Do you get sneak attack

3682
02:17:21.144 --> 02:17:22.920
because it's got all sorts of shit up in my--

3683
02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:24.163
SAM: I do, I would assume.

3684
02:17:24.163 --> 02:17:25.896
MATT: Yeah. Very much a sneak attack.

3685
02:17:25.896 --> 02:17:28.217
SAM: Not great roll, but that's okay.

3686
02:17:28.217 --> 02:17:29.677
TRAVIS: (painful groan) Hit it!

3687
02:17:29.677 --> 02:17:30.510
Hit it!

3688
02:17:31.946 --> 02:17:32.779
SAM: Terrible.

3689
02:17:32.779 --> 02:17:33.612
LAURA: Yeah.

3690
02:17:33.612 --> 02:17:36.418
TRAVIS: It's in my fucking pancreas!

3691
02:17:36.418 --> 02:17:37.668
SAM: I'll use--

3692
02:17:39.498 --> 02:17:41.746
21. I'll use Fury of the Small,

3693
02:17:41.746 --> 02:17:42.816
add another nine points,

3694
02:17:42.816 --> 02:17:44.458
so that's 30 points of damage.

3695
02:17:44.458 --> 02:17:45.904
MATT: Woo nice!

3696
02:17:45.904 --> 02:17:47.298
Of which it is not resistant to any,

3697
02:17:47.298 --> 02:17:48.824
since the light emanating from the globe

3698
02:17:48.824 --> 02:17:50.728
has taken away their resistance.

3699
02:17:50.728 --> 02:17:52.218
As you fire the bolt,

3700
02:17:52.218 --> 02:17:53.218
it strikes in the back of the neck,

3701
02:17:53.218 --> 02:17:55.185
and actually comes through the front of the chin a bit,

3702
02:17:55.185 --> 02:17:57.466
causing its jaw to dislocate slightly to one side.

3703
02:17:57.466 --> 02:17:59.945
It's looking down at Fjord's face.

3704
02:17:59.945 --> 02:18:01.698
TRAVIS: (shouting) Oh, fuck!

3705
02:18:01.698 --> 02:18:02.531
MATT: (moaning)

3706
02:18:03.427 --> 02:18:04.480
MARISHA: Turtles are worse!

3707
02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:05.898
SAM: Still up? It's still up?

3708
02:18:05.898 --> 02:18:08.590
MATT: Yeah, it's still up.

3709
02:18:08.590 --> 02:18:10.589
SAM: I will fire again.

3710
02:18:10.589 --> 02:18:13.957
MATT: Go for it.
SAM: Fire again, that's a 24 to hit.

3711
02:18:13.957 --> 02:18:15.090
MATT: That hits.

3712
02:18:15.090 --> 02:18:18.629
SAM: Only scores, oh, that's not terrible.

3713
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:20.749
Where's my shit?

3714
02:18:20.749 --> 02:18:22.180
Ten more points of damage.

3715
02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:23.221
MATT: Nice.

3716
02:18:23.221 --> 02:18:24.054
All right.

3717
02:18:24.054 --> 02:18:26.219
(groaning)

3718
02:18:26.219 --> 02:18:27.638
It's still standing; it's looking hurt.

3719
02:18:27.638 --> 02:18:28.739
It's looking hurt.

3720
02:18:28.739 --> 02:18:30.709
SAM: If I have any more movement left,

3721
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:33.946
I'll scoot behind that rock or that tree

3722
02:18:33.946 --> 02:18:35.410
or any rock I can get to to get--

3723
02:18:35.410 --> 02:18:36.243
MATT: Back where you were,

3724
02:18:36.243 --> 02:18:37.281
or back behind this tree, or what do you...

3725
02:18:37.281 --> 02:18:39.392
SAM: Maybe behind this rock?

3726
02:18:39.392 --> 02:18:41.824
MATT: Yeah, you got enough movement to get there, all right.

3727
02:18:41.824 --> 02:18:43.266
TRAVIS: Behind this rock!

3728
02:18:43.266 --> 02:18:44.365
MATT: All right, that's your turn.

3729
02:18:44.365 --> 02:18:46.174
That brings us to Caduceus.

3730
02:18:46.174 --> 02:18:47.746
SAM: Watch out, Caduceus!

3731
02:18:47.746 --> 02:18:48.579
MATT: Harried by bats.

3732
02:18:48.579 --> 02:18:49.912
SAM: They're armed!

3733
02:18:50.936 --> 02:18:53.037
MATT: Nope, nope, nope, that's...

3734
02:18:53.037 --> 02:18:54.916
TALIESIN: That wasn't even worth the moan.

3735
02:18:54.916 --> 02:18:56.166
SAM: I'll keep trying.

3736
02:18:56.166 --> 02:18:57.182
I'm going to keep trying.

3737
02:18:57.182 --> 02:19:01.784
TALIESIN: Yeah. Let's do a...

3738
02:19:01.784 --> 02:19:05.215
Yeah, sorry, I got thrown.

3739
02:19:05.215 --> 02:19:07.703
I'm going to...

3740
02:19:07.703 --> 02:19:09.484
MATT: Beau, you're on deck.

3741
02:19:09.484 --> 02:19:12.902
MARISHA: I am. I thought Caleb--

3742
02:19:12.902 --> 02:19:14.494
Oh, Cad's going.

3743
02:19:14.494 --> 02:19:19.494
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've got, I can do something at 2nd-level.

3744
02:19:19.673 --> 02:19:24.145
I'm going to try a Ray of Enfeeblement.

3745
02:19:24.145 --> 02:19:25.387
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: For fun.

3746
02:19:25.387 --> 02:19:26.520
MATT: On?

3747
02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:28.149
TALIESIN: I'm actually going to hit

3748
02:19:28.149 --> 02:19:29.648
the thing that's attacking Caleb.

3749
02:19:29.648 --> 02:19:31.728
I'm going to stay where I am with the bats,

3750
02:19:31.728 --> 02:19:33.859
and I'm going to fire through

3751
02:19:33.859 --> 02:19:35.039
and hit the creature that's--

3752
02:19:35.039 --> 02:19:37.861
MATT: Okay, roll for the ray, it's a spell attack.

3753
02:19:37.861 --> 02:19:39.732
TALIESIN: It's a constitution,

3754
02:19:39.732 --> 02:19:41.970
it's attack save constitution.

3755
02:19:41.970 --> 02:19:43.470
MATT: Oh, I was wrong.

3756
02:19:46.690 --> 02:19:48.160
No, that's a ten.

3757
02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:49.743
TRAVIS: Nice.
MATT: All right.

3758
02:19:50.718 --> 02:19:53.707
TALIESIN: You deal only half damage.

3759
02:19:53.707 --> 02:19:55.341
Oh, is it weapon attack?

3760
02:19:55.341 --> 02:19:57.290
Would this constitute a weapon attack, it has a weapon?

3761
02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:58.970
MATT: They are considered weapon attacks.
TALIESIN: Okay.

3762
02:19:58.970 --> 02:20:00.672
You swing, okay, so.

3763
02:20:00.672 --> 02:20:03.981
Yeah, it's at half damage no matter what.

3764
02:20:03.981 --> 02:20:07.123
Then, oh boy.

3765
02:20:07.123 --> 02:20:08.541
MATT: Does it make a save at the end of its turn?

3766
02:20:08.541 --> 02:20:10.408
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3767
02:20:10.408 --> 02:20:11.241
MATT: Okay.

3768
02:20:11.241 --> 02:20:12.666
TALIESIN: It can make it save against the spell.

3769
02:20:12.666 --> 02:20:13.974
MATT: Got it.

3770
02:20:13.974 --> 02:20:15.664
TALIESIN: Then, yeah, that's,

3771
02:20:15.664 --> 02:20:19.434
I think that's all I can do without ruining something.

3772
02:20:19.434 --> 02:20:21.184
Just double checking.

3773
02:20:22.925 --> 02:20:25.282
Yeah, just for fun, I'm going to see what happens

3774
02:20:25.282 --> 02:20:27.653
if I turn invisible, if the bats go away.

3775
02:20:27.653 --> 02:20:28.486
MATT: Okay.

3776
02:20:29.486 --> 02:20:31.507
You vanish on top of your moorbounder.

3777
02:20:31.507 --> 02:20:33.040
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

3778
02:20:35.045 --> 02:20:36.620
I'm, yeah.

3779
02:20:38.112 --> 02:20:39.562
MATT: All right.

3780
02:20:39.562 --> 02:20:40.893
That finishes your go.

3781
02:20:40.893 --> 02:20:43.093
Top of the round, Beau, you are up.

3782
02:20:43.093 --> 02:20:46.085
MARISHA: Does my guy look like he's getting crackly

3783
02:20:46.085 --> 02:20:47.184
from the light as well?

3784
02:20:47.184 --> 02:20:48.805
MATT: Yeah, the light radius was 60 feet

3785
02:20:48.805 --> 02:20:49.638
has affected all of them,

3786
02:20:49.638 --> 02:20:52.653
so they are all now in a bright globe of daylight.

3787
02:20:52.653 --> 02:20:54.464
MARISHA: Seeing them, I do two hammer fists

3788
02:20:54.464 --> 02:20:57.143
and come right across his face.

3789
02:20:57.143 --> 02:20:58.693
MATT: Go for it.

3790
02:20:58.693 --> 02:21:00.526
MARISHA: That's a natural 19.

3791
02:21:01.954 --> 02:21:04.474
Seven damage for the first one.

3792
02:21:04.474 --> 02:21:05.874
MATT: All righty.

3793
02:21:05.874 --> 02:21:07.973
MARISHA: Second attack.

3794
02:21:07.973 --> 02:21:10.223
Another natural 19, for 29.

3795
02:21:11.282 --> 02:21:13.641
With six damage, so 12 damage.

3796
02:21:13.641 --> 02:21:14.474
MATT: Nice!

3797
02:21:15.904 --> 02:21:16.737
MARISHA: How's he looking?

3798
02:21:16.737 --> 02:21:18.102
MATT: Was that six damage on that, you said?

3799
02:21:18.102 --> 02:21:19.293
TRAVIS: 12.
MARISHA: 12 total.

3800
02:21:19.293 --> 02:21:20.601
MATT: Oh, 12 total, got you.

3801
02:21:20.601 --> 02:21:23.055
MARISHA: Seven damage from the first, 12 from the second.

3802
02:21:23.055 --> 02:21:24.546
How bad's he looking?

3803
02:21:24.546 --> 02:21:26.796
MATT: He's looking pretty hurt.

3804
02:21:27.771 --> 02:21:29.680
TRAVIS: I want to insight check the DM.

3805
02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:30.519
I don't like the way he said that.

3806
02:21:30.519 --> 02:21:32.769
MARISHA: He's looking pretty hurt.

3807
02:21:36.531 --> 02:21:39.956
TRAVIS: (laughs) You son of a bitch!

3808
02:21:40.927 --> 02:21:42.927
What aren't you telling us?!

3809
02:21:45.398 --> 02:21:46.872
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows again.

3810
02:21:46.872 --> 02:21:49.040
MATT: Sure. Two more strikes.

3811
02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:52.285
TRAVIS: It's going to grow four more arms.

3812
02:21:52.285 --> 02:21:53.776
Start tickling you.

3813
02:21:53.776 --> 02:21:54.609
MARISHA: 28.

3814
02:21:54.609 --> 02:21:55.942
MATT: That hits.

3815
02:21:57.163 --> 02:21:58.231
MARISHA: 11 damage.

3816
02:21:58.231 --> 02:21:59.912
MATT: 11 points of damage, all righty.

3817
02:21:59.912 --> 02:22:02.342
MARISHA: Last one, come on, come on, come on.

3818
02:22:02.342 --> 02:22:04.513
26 to hit.

3819
02:22:04.513 --> 02:22:06.424
(whispers) Oh fuck.

3820
02:22:06.424 --> 02:22:08.812
Oh wait, is that for-- okay, okay.

3821
02:22:08.812 --> 02:22:10.112
Ten damage.

3822
02:22:10.112 --> 02:22:11.334
MATT: All right, how do you want to do this?

3823
02:22:11.334 --> 02:22:13.494
(cheering)

3824
02:22:13.494 --> 02:22:15.681
MARISHA: I did the hammer fists across his face.

3825
02:22:15.681 --> 02:22:16.514
TRAVIS: Yes!

3826
02:22:16.514 --> 02:22:18.974
MARISHA: I'm going to lace my fingers around his neck,

3827
02:22:18.974 --> 02:22:20.992
do a knee for the second attack,

3828
02:22:20.992 --> 02:22:22.731
full-on Thai Clinch,

3829
02:22:22.731 --> 02:22:25.992
and then seeing how fragile he's looking,

3830
02:22:25.992 --> 02:22:29.172
I'm going to loop around my arms,

3831
02:22:29.172 --> 02:22:31.684
I'm going to break him over my knee.

3832
02:22:31.684 --> 02:22:33.601
MATT: Okay, and as you pull for that final break,

3833
02:22:33.601 --> 02:22:34.504
the knee comes up,

3834
02:22:34.504 --> 02:22:37.032
and the actual area that's in the center of its body

3835
02:22:37.032 --> 02:22:39.054
breaks in half. You watch as the flesh

3836
02:22:39.054 --> 02:22:42.529
burns into ash, and the proximity of the daylight

3837
02:22:42.529 --> 02:22:45.272
that Caleb had summoned, as it falls into two pieces,

3838
02:22:45.272 --> 02:22:49.876
poof, poof, you hear the exhale of its last horrible wail.

3839
02:22:49.876 --> 02:22:52.065
(groaning)

3840
02:22:52.065 --> 02:22:54.647
Just shrivel up as its body slowly turns to this

3841
02:22:54.647 --> 02:22:56.895
paper thin skeleton.

3842
02:22:56.895 --> 02:23:00.325
MARISHA: And I just brush out my hair out of the way

3843
02:23:00.325 --> 02:23:01.396
and look at Yasha.

3844
02:23:01.396 --> 02:23:02.556
SAM: Ooh!

3845
02:23:02.556 --> 02:23:03.986
ASHLEY: Shit!

3846
02:23:03.986 --> 02:23:05.236
MATT: Speaking of which, it's your turn, Yasha.

3847
02:23:05.236 --> 02:23:06.069
Unless you want to move.

3848
02:23:06.069 --> 02:23:08.567
You still have movement, actually.

3849
02:23:08.567 --> 02:23:10.192
MARISHA: I will

3850
02:23:11.533 --> 02:23:13.399
move towards the one that's fucking with Caleb.

3851
02:23:15.055 --> 02:23:16.956
MATT: Easy enough with your crazy monk movement.

3852
02:23:16.956 --> 02:23:18.055
Yasha, you're up, what're you doing?

3853
02:23:18.055 --> 02:23:19.356
ASHLEY: I sort of stand there,

3854
02:23:19.356 --> 02:23:20.735
s-s-stuttering.

3855
02:23:22.035 --> 02:23:23.365
Oh.

3856
02:23:23.365 --> 02:23:24.295
Okay.

3857
02:23:24.295 --> 02:23:25.815
That one's taken care of

3858
02:23:25.815 --> 02:23:26.916
by Beau.

3859
02:23:26.916 --> 02:23:28.626
(laughter)

3860
02:23:28.626 --> 02:23:31.156
I'm going to start running towards the one

3861
02:23:31.156 --> 02:23:34.607
who has Fjord all captured.

3862
02:23:34.607 --> 02:23:35.940
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Behind it.

3863
02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:36.773
MATT: Oh, behind it.

3864
02:23:36.773 --> 02:23:38.772
ASHLEY: You think I can get behind it? Let's see.

3865
02:23:38.772 --> 02:23:40.230
TALIESIN: It's close. Behind it is--

3866
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:41.804
MATT: You can get--
ASHLEY: Can I make it?

3867
02:23:41.804 --> 02:23:43.701
MATT: -- there. You're not going to be able to get fully

3868
02:23:43.701 --> 02:23:44.634
flanking it.

3869
02:23:44.634 --> 02:23:46.334
TRAVIS: (strained) Are you here to help me?!

3870
02:23:46.334 --> 02:23:48.147
MATT: This turn. Next turn, you can.

3871
02:23:48.147 --> 02:23:50.296
ASHLEY: So I'm going to attack it from behind.

3872
02:23:50.296 --> 02:23:51.595
TRAVIS: -- It's squeezing my lungs!

3873
02:23:51.595 --> 02:23:53.731
LIAM: He's turning me into a prospector!

3874
02:23:53.731 --> 02:23:55.056
TRAVIS: Tom Hanks in The Money Pit!

3875
02:23:55.056 --> 02:23:55.889
LIAM: Save me!

3876
02:23:57.364 --> 02:24:00.196
MARISHA: Why do so many fights end up like this for you?

3877
02:24:00.196 --> 02:24:01.884
SAM: I'm just as constricted!

3878
02:24:01.884 --> 02:24:03.309
TRAVIS: (pained) Ah! Ah!

3879
02:24:03.309 --> 02:24:04.142
ASHLEY: 15.

3880
02:24:05.537 --> 02:24:06.370
Total.

3881
02:24:06.370 --> 02:24:07.394
MATT: 15 to hit.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3882
02:24:07.394 --> 02:24:09.643
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

3883
02:24:09.643 --> 02:24:10.476
ASHLEY: Okay.

3884
02:24:12.497 --> 02:24:14.126
LAURA: (twangy) C'mon Orphan Maker!

3885
02:24:14.126 --> 02:24:16.709
TRAVIS: I'm going to die laughing.

3886
02:24:16.709 --> 02:24:19.959
ASHLEY: Let's see what the Skingorger can do.

3887
02:24:21.006 --> 02:24:22.339
Well, let's see.

3888
02:24:23.217 --> 02:24:24.217
Five, six...

3889
02:24:25.501 --> 02:24:27.621
I'm going to do Savage Attacker, roll again.

3890
02:24:27.621 --> 02:24:28.454
MATT: Okay.

3891
02:24:29.462 --> 02:24:30.484
ASHLEY: That's better.

3892
02:24:30.484 --> 02:24:31.975
Seven, eight.

3893
02:24:31.975 --> 02:24:33.483
LIAM: I want to take [inaudible]

3894
02:24:33.483 --> 02:24:36.233
and put them in Monsters &amp; [inaudible].

3895
02:24:39.647 --> 02:24:40.985
ASHLEY: Okay.

3896
02:24:40.985 --> 02:24:43.168
TRAVIS: Felt like he knew where he was [inaudible].

3897
02:24:44.292 --> 02:24:46.301
ASHLEY: 15. Sorry.

3898
02:24:46.301 --> 02:24:48.050
MATT: 15 points of damage, nice. All right.

3899
02:24:48.050 --> 02:24:50.201
You slash through with the giant blade.

3900
02:24:50.201 --> 02:24:51.857
It slams into the ground.

3901
02:24:51.857 --> 02:24:53.255
It's heavier than you're used to,

3902
02:24:53.255 --> 02:24:54.758
you're just getting used to it.

3903
02:24:54.758 --> 02:24:57.009
But you did carve a chunk of flesh open

3904
02:24:57.009 --> 02:24:59.377
that's now the flap is towards where its shoulder is,

3905
02:24:59.377 --> 02:25:00.856
is exposed.

3906
02:25:00.856 --> 02:25:01.735
Where there would be muscle,

3907
02:25:01.735 --> 02:25:03.735
you see like black sinew tied beneath the skin.

3908
02:25:04.678 --> 02:25:06.428
ASHLEY: Okay, second attack.

3909
02:25:09.495 --> 02:25:10.328
Okay.

3910
02:25:11.385 --> 02:25:12.218
MARISHA: Go back!

3911
02:25:13.387 --> 02:25:15.267
ASHLEY: That is 17.

3912
02:25:15.267 --> 02:25:16.934
MATT: 17 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3913
02:25:16.934 --> 02:25:18.507
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm sorry!

3914
02:25:18.507 --> 02:25:20.747
ASHLEY: You know what, I want to try this,

3915
02:25:20.747 --> 02:25:23.467
so this point of exhaustion.

3916
02:25:23.467 --> 02:25:25.148
LIAM: (whispers) Do it!
MATT: Yeah?

3917
02:25:25.148 --> 02:25:27.170
ASHLEY: I want to try this.

3918
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:28.977
I want to do the extra 1d8 acid damage.

3919
02:25:28.977 --> 02:25:30.147
Just to see what happens.

3920
02:25:30.147 --> 02:25:30.980
MATT: Okay.

3921
02:25:32.238 --> 02:25:35.689
Because you weren't attacked last round, by the way,

3922
02:25:35.689 --> 02:25:36.729
and you weren't attacked last round,

3923
02:25:36.729 --> 02:25:38.097
you're technically not raging.

3924
02:25:38.097 --> 02:25:39.405
ASHLEY: Oh, oh!

3925
02:25:39.405 --> 02:25:42.347
MATT: You used your rage before this happened, so.

3926
02:25:42.347 --> 02:25:43.289
You would have had to use the bonus action

3927
02:25:43.289 --> 02:25:44.481
again to rage.

3928
02:25:44.481 --> 02:25:46.577
It's been a while since you've been back, so it's all good.

3929
02:25:46.577 --> 02:25:48.535
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

3930
02:25:48.535 --> 02:25:49.507
MATT: But your rage would have dropped off,

3931
02:25:49.507 --> 02:25:51.447
so you would have had to use your bonus action this round

3932
02:25:51.447 --> 02:25:52.574
to keep your rage.

3933
02:25:52.574 --> 02:25:54.940
ASHLEY: Okay, so then I'm going to--

3934
02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:56.731
LAURA: Not be able to do that?

3935
02:25:56.731 --> 02:25:58.168
ASHLEY: Yeah, I won't do that, then.

3936
02:25:58.168 --> 02:25:59.929
I won't do that.

3937
02:25:59.929 --> 02:26:01.230
Second attack.

3938
02:26:06.249 --> 02:26:09.018
12 points of damage.

3939
02:26:10.849 --> 02:26:11.699
Then can I still use

3940
02:26:11.699 --> 02:26:13.909
my bonus action then to rage?

3941
02:26:13.909 --> 02:26:14.742
MATT: Yes, you can.

3942
02:26:14.742 --> 02:26:16.408
ASHLEY: Okay. Let's do that.

3943
02:26:16.408 --> 02:26:17.438
MATT: We'll say you did that at the top of the round.

3944
02:26:17.438 --> 02:26:18.554
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

3945
02:26:18.554 --> 02:26:19.387
MATT: That's fine.

3946
02:26:19.387 --> 02:26:21.019
All right, that finishes Yasha's go. Jester, you're up.

3947
02:26:21.019 --> 02:26:23.387
LAURA: Okay, this thing is still attacking Fjord, huh?

3948
02:26:23.387 --> 02:26:24.327
MATT: Still on Fjord,

3949
02:26:24.327 --> 02:26:26.899
there's one in the back going towards Caleb.

3950
02:26:26.899 --> 02:26:28.337
That is practically unscathed.

3951
02:26:28.337 --> 02:26:29.999
There's a series of cloud of bats

3952
02:26:29.999 --> 02:26:31.267
swarming around--

3953
02:26:31.267 --> 02:26:34.014
LAURA: The guy attacking Fjord looks kind of rough?

3954
02:26:34.014 --> 02:26:35.097
MATT: It's looking hurt.

3955
02:26:38.376 --> 02:26:40.034
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to not risk it.

3956
02:26:40.034 --> 02:26:43.067
I'm going to do Guiding Bolt

3957
02:26:43.067 --> 02:26:44.627
on the one attacking Fjord.

3958
02:26:44.627 --> 02:26:45.964
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3959
02:26:45.964 --> 02:26:47.515
SAM: Is Fjord worth saving?

3960
02:26:47.515 --> 02:26:48.987
(laughter)

3961
02:26:48.987 --> 02:26:51.246
LAURA: I'm going to do it--
TRAVIS: A-fuck you.

3962
02:26:51.246 --> 02:26:53.427
LAURA: I'm going to do it at a 3rd-level.

3963
02:26:53.427 --> 02:26:55.285
SAM: Oh! That's love.

3964
02:26:55.285 --> 02:26:57.721
MATT: Roll for an attack.

3965
02:26:57.721 --> 02:26:58.912
LAURA: Whoa!
SAM: Jesus.

3966
02:26:58.912 --> 02:27:00.897
LAURA: I went aggressive.

3967
02:27:00.897 --> 02:27:02.434
That's 16.

3968
02:27:02.434 --> 02:27:03.875
MATT: Seven plus six?

3969
02:27:03.875 --> 02:27:05.075
LAURA: Seven plus nine.

3970
02:27:05.075 --> 02:27:06.417
MATT: Plus nine, 16, yeah.

3971
02:27:06.417 --> 02:27:07.416
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Fuck.

3972
02:27:07.416 --> 02:27:08.599
That'll hit.

3973
02:27:08.599 --> 02:27:09.757
LAURA: Okay.

3974
02:27:09.757 --> 02:27:10.590
MATT: Yeah!

3975
02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:11.507
LAURA: 6d6.

3976
02:27:13.771 --> 02:27:15.193
SAM: 6d6?

3977
02:27:15.193 --> 02:27:16.786
Whoa!

3978
02:27:16.786 --> 02:27:18.257
LAURA: 11.

3979
02:27:18.257 --> 02:27:19.235
19.

3980
02:27:19.235 --> 02:27:20.604
20, 23, again.

3981
02:27:20.604 --> 02:27:21.770
MATT: How do you want to do this?

3982
02:27:21.770 --> 02:27:24.027
(applause, cheering)

3983
02:27:24.027 --> 02:27:25.726
LAURA: I'm going to hold up my symbol of the Traveler,

3984
02:27:25.726 --> 02:27:27.754
and I'm going to think really hard

3985
02:27:27.754 --> 02:27:32.704
about saving Fjord and making him safe again, and

3986
02:27:34.153 --> 02:27:36.870
I'm going to send the blast of Guiding Bolt

3987
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:39.537
straight-- oh, I don't want to hit Fjord.

3988
02:27:39.537 --> 02:27:41.217
I'm going to aim it low,

3989
02:27:41.217 --> 02:27:43.566
and I'm going to go up through the back of the guy's head

3990
02:27:43.566 --> 02:27:46.606
and out with the beam of pink energy.

3991
02:27:46.606 --> 02:27:47.566
MATT: Okay.

3992
02:27:47.566 --> 02:27:49.977
As it blasts in and fires in the back of its head,

3993
02:27:49.977 --> 02:27:51.867
the head disintegrates

3994
02:27:51.867 --> 02:27:53.606
in the divine energy, leaving this

3995
02:27:53.606 --> 02:27:56.886
smoking crater where its neck and head once was.

3996
02:27:56.886 --> 02:27:58.644
Its body goes limp

3997
02:27:58.644 --> 02:28:01.318
and crumples away from Fjord's body.

3998
02:28:01.318 --> 02:28:04.706
TRAVIS: (gasping for air, coughing)

3999
02:28:04.706 --> 02:28:05.817
Thank you!

4000
02:28:05.817 --> 02:28:08.439
MATT: Now what's the range on your Hexblade's Curse?

4001
02:28:08.439 --> 02:28:12.166
TRAVIS: I regain 14 hit points if it dies,

4002
02:28:12.166 --> 02:28:13.056
about 30 feet, yeah.

4003
02:28:13.056 --> 02:28:13.889
So 14.

4004
02:28:13.889 --> 02:28:15.314
MATT: 30 feet.

4005
02:28:15.314 --> 02:28:16.389
Yeah, I don't know what else you can put it on,

4006
02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:17.386
other than one of your allies.

4007
02:28:17.386 --> 02:28:18.747
TRAVIS: I don't think I could transfer it.

4008
02:28:18.747 --> 02:28:20.235
It's not like regular Hex.

4009
02:28:20.235 --> 02:28:21.930
MATT: Oh, right, right. Are you sure?

4010
02:28:21.930 --> 02:28:24.358
TRAVIS: Yeah. It says, (reading) "Until the target dies,

4011
02:28:24.358 --> 02:28:26.226
"you die or are incapacitated.

4012
02:28:26.226 --> 02:28:27.742
"for one minute."
MATT: Thank you for that.

4013
02:28:27.742 --> 02:28:28.787
TRAVIS: 14 hit points, woo!

4014
02:28:28.787 --> 02:28:30.453
MATT: There you go.
LAURA: Yay!

4015
02:28:30.453 --> 02:28:32.536
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jessie!

4016
02:28:32.536 --> 02:28:34.195
LAURA: You're welcome.

4017
02:28:34.195 --> 02:28:35.566
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn.

4018
02:28:35.566 --> 02:28:36.399
LAURA: Yeah.

4019
02:28:36.399 --> 02:28:37.232
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

4020
02:28:37.232 --> 02:28:40.787
TRAVIS: (gasping) Aah, I want to sit down and have a cry.

4021
02:28:40.787 --> 02:28:43.046
(laughter)

4022
02:28:43.046 --> 02:28:45.176
(stammering) I'll run up and give Jessie

4023
02:28:45.176 --> 02:28:46.987
a little kiss on the cheek, say: Thanks.

4024
02:28:46.987 --> 02:28:49.536
And I'll step around her and fire two Eldritch Blasts

4025
02:28:49.536 --> 02:28:52.405
at the one attacking Caleb.

4026
02:28:52.405 --> 02:28:53.463
MATT: Go for it.
TRAVIS: All right.

4027
02:28:53.463 --> 02:28:54.879
LIAM: Volume's getting turned up in this game.

4028
02:28:56.131 --> 02:28:58.540
TRAVIS: Those are both nines,

4029
02:28:58.540 --> 02:28:59.707
which means...

4030
02:29:01.152 --> 02:29:02.552
That's an 18 to hit.

4031
02:29:02.552 --> 02:29:03.385
MATT: Yeah, both hit.

4032
02:29:03.385 --> 02:29:04.218
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

4033
02:29:04.218 --> 02:29:06.032
First one, ahh.

4034
02:29:06.032 --> 02:29:09.222
11 points Eldritch Blast damage.

4035
02:29:09.222 --> 02:29:11.422
And 13.

4036
02:29:11.422 --> 02:29:12.560
MATT: 13, nice.

4037
02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:13.393
TRAVIS: 24 total--

4038
02:29:13.393 --> 02:29:14.622
MATT: After he just got blasted with Caduceus' ray,

4039
02:29:14.622 --> 02:29:16.531
you watch its body wither slightly,

4040
02:29:16.531 --> 02:29:18.531
you can hear its wail get a little higher-pitched

4041
02:29:18.531 --> 02:29:20.360
as its actual, physical self

4042
02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:22.000
begins to lose some strength

4043
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.170
and then, (impact).

4044
02:29:23.170 --> 02:29:24.552
Almost about blown over,

4045
02:29:24.552 --> 02:29:26.131
it catches itself on the moorbounder

4046
02:29:26.131 --> 02:29:28.152
from the impact of both of your blasts,

4047
02:29:28.152 --> 02:29:30.062
then picks itself back up,

4048
02:29:30.062 --> 02:29:32.934
its two back shoulder blade arms

4049
02:29:33.879 --> 02:29:35.995
preparing for whatever its next maneuver is.

4050
02:29:35.995 --> 02:29:36.828
TRAVIS: Dope.

4051
02:29:36.828 --> 02:29:37.774
MATT: Going to move, or are you going to stay put?

4052
02:29:37.774 --> 02:29:41.703
TRAVIS: I'll use the rest of my movement

4053
02:29:41.703 --> 02:29:45.153
to step behind that little spire outcropping right there.

4054
02:29:45.153 --> 02:29:45.986
MATT: Right here?

4055
02:29:45.986 --> 02:29:47.795
TRAVIS: A little more to your right.

4056
02:29:47.795 --> 02:29:50.266
Right, yeah, there you go, great.

4057
02:29:50.266 --> 02:29:51.099
Perfect.

4058
02:29:51.099 --> 02:29:52.266
MATT: Okay, great.

4059
02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:54.847
Now it comes to the bats' turn.

4060
02:29:54.847 --> 02:29:56.528
The bats have lost interest in Caduceus,

4061
02:29:56.528 --> 02:29:58.607
as you turn invisible.

4062
02:29:58.607 --> 02:30:00.419
Instead move over to swarm around Caleb.

4063
02:30:00.419 --> 02:30:01.919
MARISHA: Aw jeez.
SAM: Oh no!

4064
02:30:02.808 --> 02:30:04.288
TALIESIN: Do I get an option even,

4065
02:30:04.288 --> 02:30:05.310
aw, never mind.

4066
02:30:05.310 --> 02:30:08.318
MATT: An opportunity? If you want to take it.

4067
02:30:11.101 --> 02:30:12.504
TALIESIN: No, no, no, I'll hold.

4068
02:30:12.504 --> 02:30:13.337
MATT: Okay.

4069
02:30:13.337 --> 02:30:14.243
Do you have War Caster?

4070
02:30:14.243 --> 02:30:16.493
TALIESIN: I do have War Caster.

4071
02:30:16.493 --> 02:30:18.475
MATT: Just double check, I believe you can--

4072
02:30:18.475 --> 02:30:19.308
TALIESIN: Oh.

4073
02:30:20.155 --> 02:30:20.988
LAURA: You can what?

4074
02:30:20.988 --> 02:30:22.571
TALIESIN: Oh wow, actually.

4075
02:30:23.645 --> 02:30:25.275
I can actually.

4076
02:30:25.275 --> 02:30:27.558
SAM: You get to cast a spell

4077
02:30:27.558 --> 02:30:29.845
on them leaving--

4078
02:30:29.845 --> 02:30:30.678
MATT: Yeah.

4079
02:30:30.678 --> 02:30:31.723
TALIESIN: I can, actually.

4080
02:30:31.723 --> 02:30:32.893
SAM: But you'll lose invisibility.

4081
02:30:32.893 --> 02:30:34.045
TALIESIN: Not this invisibility.

4082
02:30:34.045 --> 02:30:35.603
SAM: Ooh.
TALIESIN: This is weird.

4083
02:30:36.975 --> 02:30:38.558
Sure, in that case.

4084
02:30:39.653 --> 02:30:41.805
I'm going to use-- what can I use that actually,

4085
02:30:41.805 --> 02:30:42.942
I can't do a lot of anything.

4086
02:30:42.942 --> 02:30:45.795
I will then do a Sacred Flame on the bats,

4087
02:30:45.795 --> 02:30:47.104
just as they're rolling by.

4088
02:30:47.104 --> 02:30:48.021
MATT: Okay.

4089
02:30:50.598 --> 02:30:51.689
TRAVIS: Rolling on by.

4090
02:30:51.689 --> 02:30:53.958
MATT: That is a dexterity save?

4091
02:30:53.958 --> 02:30:55.111
That's a 17--

4092
02:30:55.111 --> 02:30:56.132
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

4093
02:30:56.132 --> 02:30:57.511
MATT: Sorry.

4094
02:30:57.511 --> 02:30:59.991
They swarm over to you and they roll a 22 to hit.

4095
02:30:59.991 --> 02:31:00.824
LIAM: That probably hits.

4096
02:31:00.824 --> 02:31:02.562
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Sorry.

4097
02:31:02.562 --> 02:31:03.395
LIAM: You did your best.

4098
02:31:03.395 --> 02:31:04.629
LAURA: You have your Mage Armor up, <i>ja</i>?

4099
02:31:04.629 --> 02:31:06.072
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> but that's--

4100
02:31:06.072 --> 02:31:08.846
I don't have Shield prepared today.

4101
02:31:08.846 --> 02:31:10.006
LAURA: Ooh.

4102
02:31:10.006 --> 02:31:11.471
LIAM: It's pretty below.

4103
02:31:11.471 --> 02:31:13.624
MATT: You take ten points piercing damage

4104
02:31:13.624 --> 02:31:14.751
as the swarm is now swirling around you

4105
02:31:14.751 --> 02:31:17.170
and biting you and harrying you from all sides.

4106
02:31:17.170 --> 02:31:18.839
Your moorbounder's like, (growling)

4107
02:31:18.839 --> 02:31:20.853
starting to back away looking a little

4108
02:31:20.853 --> 02:31:22.700
spooked by the bats and frustrated by them.

4109
02:31:22.700 --> 02:31:25.736
LIAM: <i>Schmerz! Schmerz!</i>

4110
02:31:25.736 --> 02:31:28.095
MATT: Now it is the creature's turn.

4111
02:31:28.095 --> 02:31:28.928
TALIESIN: Shit.

4112
02:31:28.928 --> 02:31:32.520
MATT: That one is going to reach up

4113
02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:36.687
and attempt to embrace you off of the moorbounder.

4114
02:31:38.991 --> 02:31:43.357
It's a natural 19, that's going to be a 26 to hit.

4115
02:31:43.357 --> 02:31:45.126
LIAM: Yeah, that definitely hits.

4116
02:31:45.126 --> 02:31:47.050
TALIESIN: Shit, shit, shit.

4117
02:31:47.050 --> 02:31:50.041
MATT: Rolled good on that one.

4118
02:31:50.041 --> 02:31:52.626
You, Caleb, take...

4119
02:31:58.052 --> 02:32:00.446
20 points of piercing damage.

4120
02:32:00.446 --> 02:32:02.986
Sorry, 23, plus three to that roll,

4121
02:32:02.986 --> 02:32:04.233
and you are grappled.

4122
02:32:04.233 --> 02:32:06.335
Pulled you off the moorbounder, now,

4123
02:32:06.335 --> 02:32:08.088
and you are being held by its arms

4124
02:32:08.088 --> 02:32:09.465
as it pulls you in closely

4125
02:32:09.465 --> 02:32:10.940
and you are frightened in its grasp.

4126
02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:12.502
LIAM: Okay.

4127
02:32:12.502 --> 02:32:13.335
MATT: All right.

4128
02:32:13.335 --> 02:32:15.489
LIAM: The ball of light is just

4129
02:32:15.489 --> 02:32:17.538
clasped in my hand going, (whooshes).

4130
02:32:17.538 --> 02:32:18.455
Shining light everywhere?

4131
02:32:18.455 --> 02:32:19.830
MATT: You're just holding it, and you're just,

4132
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:20.671
pulled up against you

4133
02:32:20.671 --> 02:32:21.599
so now there's beams of it shooting out

4134
02:32:21.599 --> 02:32:22.432
in different directions.

4135
02:32:22.432 --> 02:32:23.890
LIAM: Okay.

4136
02:32:23.890 --> 02:32:24.723
MATT: Also.

4137
02:32:25.915 --> 02:32:26.748
What's up?

4138
02:32:26.748 --> 02:32:28.582
MARISHA: It's attacking Caleb, the thing in front of me?

4139
02:32:28.582 --> 02:32:29.415
MATT: Yeah, it embraced him,

4140
02:32:29.415 --> 02:32:30.595
and Caleb is now being held.

4141
02:32:30.595 --> 02:32:31.516
MARISHA: Can I take a reaction?

4142
02:32:31.516 --> 02:32:33.425
MATT: You do take half that damage, by the way, as a note.

4143
02:32:33.425 --> 02:32:35.937
Because it does half damage from the spell he did.

4144
02:32:35.937 --> 02:32:37.265
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

4145
02:32:37.265 --> 02:32:39.553
MATT: So 11.
LIAM: So 20, ten from the bats,

4146
02:32:39.553 --> 02:32:41.462
but that's not affected,

4147
02:32:41.462 --> 02:32:42.822
and 23 from the--

4148
02:32:42.822 --> 02:32:44.462
MATT: And 11 from the creature.

4149
02:32:44.462 --> 02:32:45.445
LIAM: So 11 total.

4150
02:32:45.445 --> 02:32:46.936
MATT: So between the two of them, 21.

4151
02:32:46.936 --> 02:32:48.254
LAURA: That's way better.

4152
02:32:48.254 --> 02:32:50.458
MARISHA: Can I get a sentry attack?

4153
02:32:50.458 --> 02:32:51.966
MATT: Hmm?
MARISHA: Sentry attack?

4154
02:32:51.966 --> 02:32:54.049
MATT: You can, go for it.

4155
02:32:56.557 --> 02:32:57.598
MARISHA: Damn!

4156
02:32:57.598 --> 02:33:00.121
Wherever these rolls the past ten weeks,

4157
02:33:00.121 --> 02:33:01.599
29!

4158
02:33:01.599 --> 02:33:04.222
MATT: 29 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4159
02:33:04.222 --> 02:33:05.055
MARISHA: Yeah.

4160
02:33:05.055 --> 02:33:06.427
11.

4161
02:33:06.427 --> 02:33:07.642
MATT: Okay.

4162
02:33:07.642 --> 02:33:08.575
SAM: Ga-goosh.
MARISHA: Whack.

4163
02:33:08.575 --> 02:33:10.565
MATT: Go ahead and roll some damage.

4164
02:33:10.565 --> 02:33:11.743
MARISHA: 11.

4165
02:33:11.743 --> 02:33:14.431
MATT: 11 points of damage, nice.

4166
02:33:14.431 --> 02:33:15.852
Then--
SAM: But for your damage?

4167
02:33:15.852 --> 02:33:17.309
(laughter)

4168
02:33:17.309 --> 02:33:19.282
MATT: But what damage do you do?

4169
02:33:19.282 --> 02:33:20.812
For the ray you do,

4170
02:33:20.812 --> 02:33:22.428
does it affect weapon attacks?

4171
02:33:22.428 --> 02:33:23.282
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

4172
02:33:23.282 --> 02:33:24.212
MATT: You got it, all right.

4173
02:33:24.212 --> 02:33:26.357
It's going to its reaction to do Tightening Embrace.

4174
02:33:26.357 --> 02:33:28.759
So as you punch the creature,

4175
02:33:28.759 --> 02:33:30.178
it squeezes on Caleb,

4176
02:33:30.178 --> 02:33:33.349
and Caleb, you hear its wail resonate

4177
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:34.389
through your entire body.

4178
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:35.439
MARISHA: Oh, did I do that?

4179
02:33:35.439 --> 02:33:36.272
MARISHA: Yeah, you did.

4180
02:33:36.272 --> 02:33:37.105
(laughter)

4181
02:33:37.105 --> 02:33:39.919
TRAVIS: (imitating Steve Urkel) Did I do that?

4182
02:33:39.919 --> 02:33:41.450
TALIESIN: It was going to happen anyway.

4183
02:33:41.450 --> 02:33:45.333
MATT: All right, you take 23 points of psychic damage.

4184
02:33:45.333 --> 02:33:46.176
LIAM: Not halved?

4185
02:33:46.176 --> 02:33:47.785
MATT: Not halved.

4186
02:33:47.785 --> 02:33:48.618
MARISHA: Can I...

4187
02:33:49.765 --> 02:33:52.096
No, I can't, I can't spend a ki point, right?

4188
02:33:52.096 --> 02:33:54.288
I can only do that on my turn?

4189
02:33:54.288 --> 02:33:55.371
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4190
02:33:56.819 --> 02:33:58.964
MARISHA: I feel like he's just responding.

4191
02:33:58.964 --> 02:34:01.048
MATT: Leaping off the ruin, there.

4192
02:34:01.048 --> 02:34:02.109
SAM: Oh god.

4193
02:34:02.109 --> 02:34:04.265
MATT: Fjord, this has been your worst nightmare, dude.

4194
02:34:04.265 --> 02:34:05.966
Your placement has not been positive.

4195
02:34:05.966 --> 02:34:08.107
You hear this, (groaning).

4196
02:34:08.107 --> 02:34:10.424
TRAVIS: No! I want out of this haunted house!

4197
02:34:10.424 --> 02:34:14.433
MATT: You glance up as one falls limply off the side

4198
02:34:14.433 --> 02:34:16.806
and is going to attempt to drop

4199
02:34:16.806 --> 02:34:18.104
and grab you in the process.

4200
02:34:18.104 --> 02:34:18.937
LAURA: No!

4201
02:34:19.775 --> 02:34:21.145
MATT: He needs to make an athletics check

4202
02:34:21.145 --> 02:34:22.154
or he's going to take some damage.

4203
02:34:22.154 --> 02:34:23.705
TRAVIS: Please fall.

4204
02:34:23.705 --> 02:34:25.956
MATT: Rolled a four, it failed.

4205
02:34:25.956 --> 02:34:29.046
It does take-- that would be a 30-foot fall.

4206
02:34:29.046 --> 02:34:31.665
That's 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage.

4207
02:34:31.665 --> 02:34:32.676
Ten points of bludgeoning damage

4208
02:34:32.676 --> 02:34:35.116
it takes right out of the bat.

4209
02:34:35.116 --> 02:34:37.017
Right off the bat. (laughs)

4210
02:34:37.017 --> 02:34:40.857
Right out of the bat's a whole very messy thing.

4211
02:34:40.857 --> 02:34:42.478
Poof, lands, takes damage and then

4212
02:34:42.478 --> 02:34:44.166
tries to embrace you again.

4213
02:34:44.166 --> 02:34:45.068
TRAVIS: Fuck.

4214
02:34:47.097 --> 02:34:49.268
MATT: With a 12. Does not hit.

4215
02:34:49.268 --> 02:34:50.191
TRAVIS: That does not hit.
MATT: No.

4216
02:34:50.191 --> 02:34:52.625
TALIESIN: Thank god.
LIAM: 42.

4217
02:34:52.625 --> 02:34:54.021
MATT: Oh and at the end of that one's turn,

4218
02:34:54.021 --> 02:34:54.854
it's going to try and roll

4219
02:34:54.854 --> 02:34:57.389
to resist your thing.

4220
02:34:57.389 --> 02:35:00.307
It's going to be a 17,

4221
02:35:00.307 --> 02:35:01.240
what's your DC on it?

4222
02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:02.088
TALIESIN: Ray of Enfeeblement,

4223
02:35:02.088 --> 02:35:03.389
MATT: What your spell DC is.

4224
02:35:03.389 --> 02:35:04.819
TALIESIN: That's 17.

4225
02:35:04.819 --> 02:35:05.912
MATT: It just manages to resist the ray,

4226
02:35:05.912 --> 02:35:07.339
so it's no longer affected by it.

4227
02:35:07.339 --> 02:35:08.189
It gets its strength back.

4228
02:35:08.189 --> 02:35:09.022
TALIESIN: That's fine.

4229
02:35:09.022 --> 02:35:10.503
MATT: That one's taken some damage.

4230
02:35:11.611 --> 02:35:12.490
That ends their turn,

4231
02:35:12.490 --> 02:35:13.952
now it's the moorbounders' turn.

4232
02:35:13.952 --> 02:35:16.381
SAM: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4233
02:35:16.381 --> 02:35:18.310
Moorbounder people.

4234
02:35:18.310 --> 02:35:20.643
What do you want them to do?

4235
02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:24.381
LAURA: Mine's going to run over and

4236
02:35:24.381 --> 02:35:25.831
fucking claw the thing

4237
02:35:25.831 --> 02:35:27.900
that just dropped down on fucking Fjord!

4238
02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:31.533
MATT: Okay. (galloping) Rush over to that side.

4239
02:35:31.533 --> 02:35:32.889
Go ahead and roll for an attack.

4240
02:35:32.889 --> 02:35:34.972
LAURA: (frustrated noise)

4241
02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:38.598
Wait, plus six, yeah.

4242
02:35:38.598 --> 02:35:39.750
13.

4243
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:42.238
MATT: 13, that does not hit, unfortunately.

4244
02:35:42.238 --> 02:35:43.838
It goes to strike and

4245
02:35:43.838 --> 02:35:45.150
it brings its claw forward,

4246
02:35:45.150 --> 02:35:46.820
and since it's holding Fjord,

4247
02:35:46.820 --> 02:35:48.209
or not-- actually, it did not touch,

4248
02:35:48.209 --> 02:35:50.249
didn't manage to grab Fjord,

4249
02:35:50.249 --> 02:35:53.683
but it's not quite able to fully--

4250
02:35:53.683 --> 02:35:55.836
actually, interesting point of order,

4251
02:35:55.836 --> 02:35:58.516
it would not have been able to get close enough to Fjord.

4252
02:35:58.516 --> 02:36:00.537
Through the pincer space there

4253
02:36:00.537 --> 02:36:01.544
to the creature, because Fjord's

4254
02:36:01.544 --> 02:36:02.994
blocking the space there.

4255
02:36:02.994 --> 02:36:03.914
So yeah.

4256
02:36:03.914 --> 02:36:05.354
As part of the narrative there,

4257
02:36:05.354 --> 02:36:06.884
it couldn't even get up

4258
02:36:06.884 --> 02:36:08.536
to strike the creature.

4259
02:36:08.536 --> 02:36:09.369
LAURA: Oh, okay.

4260
02:36:10.706 --> 02:36:12.274
MATT: Caleb, anything with your moorbounder?

4261
02:36:12.274 --> 02:36:14.441
LIAM: Jannik, kill this thing!

4262
02:36:15.314 --> 02:36:17.981
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

4263
02:36:19.234 --> 02:36:20.536
LIAM: 25 to hit.

4264
02:36:20.536 --> 02:36:21.765
MAT: That hits, roll damage.

4265
02:36:21.765 --> 02:36:24.064
LIAM: He loves me so.

4266
02:36:24.064 --> 02:36:26.311
Five, seven, no, wait.

4267
02:36:26.311 --> 02:36:27.223
SAM: Nine.

4268
02:36:27.223 --> 02:36:28.834
LIAM: It's two and two added?

4269
02:36:28.834 --> 02:36:30.256
SAM: It's 2d4 plus four.

4270
02:36:30.256 --> 02:36:31.256
LIAM: Plus four, yeah.

4271
02:36:31.256 --> 02:36:32.184
Nine, correct, thank you.

4272
02:36:32.184 --> 02:36:33.784
MATT: Nine points of damage, nice.

4273
02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:34.925
All right, that one's starting to look hurt.

4274
02:36:34.925 --> 02:36:37.477
That one's taken some damage, now.

4275
02:36:37.477 --> 02:36:39.476
TALIESIN: Since I'm on mine, I'm going to roll around

4276
02:36:39.476 --> 02:36:40.885
to the other side and attack.

4277
02:36:40.885 --> 02:36:44.578
I'm going to, yeah, come in there.

4278
02:36:44.578 --> 02:36:46.048
No, I mean like,

4279
02:36:46.048 --> 02:36:47.779
attacking the one Caleb, also.

4280
02:36:47.779 --> 02:36:49.120
MATT: Oh, gotcha.

4281
02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:50.549
TALIESIN: It's going to take me,

4282
02:36:50.549 --> 02:36:51.535
if I can get in here.

4283
02:36:51.535 --> 02:36:53.031
MATT: You move around here.

4284
02:36:53.031 --> 02:36:54.448
TALIESIN: Yeah, in there.

4285
02:36:55.898 --> 02:36:57.369
MATT: Yep, and it's a swarm,

4286
02:36:57.369 --> 02:36:58.410
so you can actually move through it.

4287
02:36:58.410 --> 02:36:59.243
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4288
02:36:59.243 --> 02:37:00.720
MATT: You move around and get right up against--

4289
02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:01.553
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

4290
02:37:03.274 --> 02:37:05.347
It's going to attack

4291
02:37:05.347 --> 02:37:07.781
the one attacking Caleb.

4292
02:37:07.781 --> 02:37:09.456
and that's ten.

4293
02:37:09.456 --> 02:37:10.816
MATT: Ten misses, unfortunately.

4294
02:37:10.816 --> 02:37:12.517
As it jumps off the rock and lands on the ground,

4295
02:37:12.517 --> 02:37:14.416
it swipes out towards it,

4296
02:37:14.416 --> 02:37:16.757
and the creature ducks out of the way.

4297
02:37:16.757 --> 02:37:18.716
(raspy breathing)

4298
02:37:18.716 --> 02:37:19.738
That finishes the moorbounders' round,

4299
02:37:19.738 --> 02:37:22.368
Nott and Caleb, you're up.

4300
02:37:22.368 --> 02:37:24.208
LIAM: Does the Glove of Blasting

4301
02:37:24.208 --> 02:37:26.819
require me to do verbal, somatic, and all that

4302
02:37:26.819 --> 02:37:28.379
or does it just work?

4303
02:37:28.379 --> 02:37:30.059
MATT: Unless it specifies,

4304
02:37:30.059 --> 02:37:31.077
whatever it casts a spell--

4305
02:37:31.077 --> 02:37:32.155
LIAM: Well, it doesn't say it on here,

4306
02:37:32.155 --> 02:37:33.968
it does for the spell.

4307
02:37:33.968 --> 02:37:34.848
MATT: Right.

4308
02:37:34.848 --> 02:37:38.277
I mean, if it says there "without components,"

4309
02:37:38.277 --> 02:37:39.950
then you wouldn't need those,

4310
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:40.915
but if it doesn't specify,

4311
02:37:40.915 --> 02:37:42.931
then you still need what's required of the spell.

4312
02:37:42.931 --> 02:37:43.764
LIAM: It doesn't say either way.

4313
02:37:43.764 --> 02:37:45.613
MATT: Then yeah, you still need to use,

4314
02:37:45.613 --> 02:37:47.101
be able to talk and move your hands.

4315
02:37:47.101 --> 02:37:48.233
LIAM: Okay.

4316
02:37:48.233 --> 02:37:50.390
Then I am going to try to

4317
02:37:50.390 --> 02:37:53.146
wrestle out of this thing's grip ineffectually.

4318
02:37:53.146 --> 02:37:54.745
MATT: Okay. You can still cast spells

4319
02:37:54.745 --> 02:37:56.754
while you're grappled, it just means you can't move.

4320
02:37:56.754 --> 02:37:58.718
LIAM: Oh, I'm not held, too?

4321
02:37:58.718 --> 02:37:59.659
I can still do--

4322
02:37:59.659 --> 02:38:00.906
MATT: Even then, when you were restrained,

4323
02:38:00.906 --> 02:38:04.416
you could still cast spells. You just have disadvantage

4324
02:38:04.416 --> 02:38:05.976
on attack rolls.

4325
02:38:05.976 --> 02:38:09.226
Creatures have advantage on attack rolls against you.

4326
02:38:09.226 --> 02:38:10.328
LIAM: Ah well, fuck it then, I will cast

4327
02:38:10.328 --> 02:38:11.987
Magic Missile at 5th-level.

4328
02:38:11.987 --> 02:38:12.837
MATT: Right into its chest.

4329
02:38:12.837 --> 02:38:15.670
All right, go for it, roll damage.

4330
02:38:17.192 --> 02:38:20.775
LAURA: Can I say something?

4331
02:38:20.775 --> 02:38:23.266
I got this wrong because it's in the notes,

4332
02:38:23.266 --> 02:38:25.296
it's not on the main page of the moorbounders,

4333
02:38:25.296 --> 02:38:27.928
so it didn't show up when I clicked on it.

4334
02:38:27.928 --> 02:38:32.928
It actually does 4d4 slashing damage.

4335
02:38:32.928 --> 02:38:34.448
4d4 plus four.

4336
02:38:34.448 --> 02:38:36.346
It only adds a plus four to attack,

4337
02:38:36.346 --> 02:38:37.386
not a plus six.

4338
02:38:37.386 --> 02:38:38.648
So we've been doing it wrong,

4339
02:38:38.648 --> 02:38:40.586
based on-- because your notes on it

4340
02:38:40.586 --> 02:38:41.419
just show it differently than I--

4341
02:38:41.419 --> 02:38:43.494
MATT: Gotcha. Okay, no worries

4342
02:38:43.494 --> 02:38:45.657
LAURA: And he can jump 30 feet.

4343
02:38:45.657 --> 02:38:46.956
SAM: Whoa!

4344
02:38:46.956 --> 02:38:47.789
TRAVIS: Fuck.

4345
02:38:49.251 --> 02:38:50.684
MATT: Good, there you go.

4346
02:38:50.684 --> 02:38:51.555
LIAM: 25 total.

4347
02:38:51.555 --> 02:38:52.888
MATT: 25 damage, nice!

4348
02:38:54.963 --> 02:38:57.135
So Caleb held him there,

4349
02:38:57.135 --> 02:38:58.313
puts his hand up right towards

4350
02:38:58.313 --> 02:38:59.935
the sternum of this creature,

4351
02:38:59.935 --> 02:39:01.015
And (explosion)

4352
02:39:01.015 --> 02:39:03.433
you watch this blast of arcane force

4353
02:39:03.433 --> 02:39:05.324
send a shockwave out

4354
02:39:05.324 --> 02:39:08.170
from the center of where he's being pulled inward.

4355
02:39:08.170 --> 02:39:10.324
It leaves this crater hole

4356
02:39:10.324 --> 02:39:12.724
and its torso begins to (sloughing)

4357
02:39:12.724 --> 02:39:15.404
just drip out black liquid,

4358
02:39:15.404 --> 02:39:17.244
but it's still standing.

4359
02:39:17.244 --> 02:39:18.135
Is that the end of your turn?

4360
02:39:18.135 --> 02:39:19.421
LIAM: Yeah, I can't move.

4361
02:39:19.421 --> 02:39:21.904
MATT: Okay, at the end of the turn

4362
02:39:21.904 --> 02:39:24.831
you take 6d8 psychic damage.

4363
02:39:24.831 --> 02:39:26.683
SAM: 6d8?!

4364
02:39:26.683 --> 02:39:27.516
LIAM: Peace.

4365
02:39:27.516 --> 02:39:29.915
TALIESIN: Wait, at the end of Caleb's turn?

4366
02:39:29.915 --> 02:39:31.678
SAM: Because he's enveloped.

4367
02:39:31.678 --> 02:39:33.573
MATT: Yeah, because you're still held in its space.

4368
02:39:33.573 --> 02:39:35.223
At the end of the turn, while you're still being held,

4369
02:39:35.223 --> 02:39:36.522
you take additional damage.

4370
02:39:36.522 --> 02:39:38.280
SAM: Oh boy.

4371
02:39:40.634 --> 02:39:41.467
MATT: Okay.

4372
02:39:44.190 --> 02:39:45.904
SAM: You're surrounded by bats and shit.

4373
02:39:45.904 --> 02:39:47.240
MATT: You take 30 points of psychic damage.

4374
02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:48.394
LIAM: Yeah, I'm out.

4375
02:39:48.394 --> 02:39:49.713
TALIESIN: All right.

4376
02:39:49.713 --> 02:39:52.345
MATT: Caleb goes limp in its grasp

4377
02:39:52.345 --> 02:39:54.253
and it begins to--

4378
02:39:54.253 --> 02:39:56.533
it's trying to tuck Caleb up into the wound

4379
02:39:56.533 --> 02:39:57.914
that he left in its body.

4380
02:39:57.914 --> 02:39:59.624
LAURA: Eww!
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

4381
02:39:59.624 --> 02:40:02.034
TRAVIS: Oh, he's trying to do what?

4382
02:40:02.034 --> 02:40:04.142
MATT: Just trying to stuff him into the wound of his left--

4383
02:40:04.142 --> 02:40:05.016
TRAVIS: What?!

4384
02:40:05.016 --> 02:40:07.013
MATT: He's trying to pull it closer towards it

4385
02:40:07.013 --> 02:40:08.605
as it goes, (gasps).

4386
02:40:08.605 --> 02:40:10.893
(screaming)

4387
02:40:10.893 --> 02:40:13.154
LIAM: Is he Fjording me? Am I being Fjorded?

4388
02:40:14.354 --> 02:40:15.965
ASHLEY: Oh no!

4389
02:40:15.965 --> 02:40:16.798
MATT: Nott?

4390
02:40:18.114 --> 02:40:19.415
SAM: I mean, I don't even,

4391
02:40:19.415 --> 02:40:21.434
I don't think I can even see any of that.

4392
02:40:21.434 --> 02:40:24.042
I'm going to run towards the hole in the rocks.

4393
02:40:24.042 --> 02:40:24.875
MATT: Okay.

4394
02:40:26.325 --> 02:40:27.713
20, 25, 30.
TRAVIS: At least he doesn't do the face

4395
02:40:27.713 --> 02:40:29.288
when he makes the sound!

4396
02:40:29.288 --> 02:40:30.842
MATT: You come through the space there.

4397
02:40:30.842 --> 02:40:31.944
You can see right now

4398
02:40:31.944 --> 02:40:32.832
there's the moorbounder

4399
02:40:32.832 --> 02:40:34.122
and there's the creature

4400
02:40:34.122 --> 02:40:35.933
right on the side next to Fjord,

4401
02:40:35.933 --> 02:40:37.832
and then across the way, you can,

4402
02:40:37.832 --> 02:40:39.752
you have a hard time seeing what's happening over there.

4403
02:40:39.752 --> 02:40:40.792
SAM: Yeah.

4404
02:40:40.792 --> 02:40:44.372
I'm going to draw on the one with Fjord

4405
02:40:44.372 --> 02:40:48.362
and say: Fjord, looks like you could use an extra hand!

4406
02:40:48.362 --> 02:40:50.104
(laughter)

4407
02:40:50.104 --> 02:40:51.002
MATT: There it goes.

4408
02:40:51.002 --> 02:40:53.944
SAM: I'll fire at the thing's hand.

4409
02:40:53.944 --> 02:40:55.493
MATT: Go for it, go for it.

4410
02:40:55.493 --> 02:40:56.326
SAM: 22.

4411
02:40:56.326 --> 02:40:58.909
MATT: 22, go ahead and roll damage.

4412
02:41:00.072 --> 02:41:00.905
SAM: Okay.

4413
02:41:03.026 --> 02:41:03.859
LIAM: Nice spread.

4414
02:41:06.543 --> 02:41:07.582
SAM: 24.

4415
02:41:07.582 --> 02:41:09.611
MATT: 24 damage, nice!

4416
02:41:09.611 --> 02:41:11.849
(whooshes) Its arm severs off at the elbow

4417
02:41:11.849 --> 02:41:12.911
and you watch as

4418
02:41:12.911 --> 02:41:15.080
one of its long, pointed limbs

4419
02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:15.913
hits the ground.

4420
02:41:15.913 --> 02:41:17.522
(groaning)

4421
02:41:17.522 --> 02:41:18.752
Looks back towards you,

4422
02:41:18.752 --> 02:41:21.322
it looks so sad!

4423
02:41:21.322 --> 02:41:22.905
And just sorrowful,

4424
02:41:23.782 --> 02:41:26.241
and fucking frightening.

4425
02:41:26.241 --> 02:41:27.201
SAM: Wow. (laughs)

4426
02:41:27.201 --> 02:41:28.034
MATT: What else you doing?

4427
02:41:28.034 --> 02:41:29.984
SAM: Guh, guh!

4428
02:41:29.984 --> 02:41:32.792
I will, oh boy,

4429
02:41:32.792 --> 02:41:34.801
I'll reload and fire again.

4430
02:41:34.801 --> 02:41:35.643
Why not?

4431
02:41:35.643 --> 02:41:37.059
Natural 20.

4432
02:41:37.059 --> 02:41:40.165
(cheering)

4433
02:41:40.165 --> 02:41:41.094
MATT: All right!

4434
02:41:41.094 --> 02:41:41.927
SAM: Okay.

4435
02:41:42.821 --> 02:41:46.439
That's a 12 more points of damage,

4436
02:41:46.439 --> 02:41:48.541
MATT: Plus your dexterity modifier, right?

4437
02:41:48.541 --> 02:41:50.110
SAM: That's six plus six.

4438
02:41:50.110 --> 02:41:51.272
MATT: Well, six times two,

4439
02:41:51.272 --> 02:41:52.250
because you did a critical hit.

4440
02:41:52.250 --> 02:41:53.083
SAM: Oh.

4441
02:41:53.083 --> 02:41:54.392
That's 18?

4442
02:41:54.392 --> 02:41:55.872
MATT: 18 points of damage.

4443
02:41:55.872 --> 02:41:57.380
SAM: Plus it fires again.

4444
02:41:57.380 --> 02:41:58.520
MATT: That's right, because they--

4445
02:41:58.520 --> 02:41:59.610
LIAM: Oh yeah, that's awesome!

4446
02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:03.951
SAM: Natural one!

4447
02:42:03.951 --> 02:42:05.534
Something bad happens to me!

4448
02:42:06.876 --> 02:42:08.120
MATT: You shoot yourself!

4449
02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:09.080
SAM: I shoot myself!

4450
02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:10.752
(laughter)

4451
02:42:10.752 --> 02:42:13.718
TRAVIS: Awesome! Amazing!

4452
02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:17.960
I suffer four points of piercing damage!

4453
02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:19.930
(laughter)

4454
02:42:19.930 --> 02:42:20.791
I load again!

4455
02:42:20.791 --> 02:42:24.071
(cries of pain)

4456
02:42:24.071 --> 02:42:26.230
TRAVIS: So badass, like bank shot.

4457
02:42:26.230 --> 02:42:28.000
(firing) (yelping)

4458
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.625
(laughter)

4459
02:42:31.625 --> 02:42:33.559
MATT: Perfect! Does that finish your turn?

4460
02:42:33.559 --> 02:42:34.600
SAM: That's it!

4461
02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:37.901
MATT: Caduceus, you come back

4462
02:42:37.901 --> 02:42:38.734
into your space.

4463
02:42:38.734 --> 02:42:40.567
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to move

4464
02:42:41.770 --> 02:42:43.603
behind, I'm going to move

4465
02:42:45.881 --> 02:42:47.048
next to Caleb.

4466
02:42:48.338 --> 02:42:49.770
MATT: Right, the moorbounder,

4467
02:42:49.770 --> 02:42:51.490
are you yourself going to be next to Caleb?

4468
02:42:51.490 --> 02:42:53.358
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop off the warbounder

4469
02:42:53.358 --> 02:42:55.389
and move next to Caleb.

4470
02:42:55.389 --> 02:42:58.789
MARISHA: The warbounder! Yeah!

4471
02:42:58.789 --> 02:43:00.794
TRAVIS: No longer moorbounder!

4472
02:43:00.794 --> 02:43:01.819
MARISHA: Totally a warbounder!

4473
02:43:01.819 --> 02:43:03.928
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at 4th-level.

4474
02:43:03.928 --> 02:43:05.229
MATT: Go for it.

4475
02:43:05.229 --> 02:43:06.062
MARISHA: ...but I'm so into it.

4476
02:43:06.062 --> 02:43:06.984
SAM: On a natural 20, it fires again.

4477
02:43:06.984 --> 02:43:10.698
MARISHA: He's so distracted, he didn't even know!

4478
02:43:10.698 --> 02:43:11.698
TALIESIN: That means

4479
02:43:12.748 --> 02:43:14.109
Cure Wounds at 4th-level,

4480
02:43:14.109 --> 02:43:16.029
you are up to 37 hit points.

4481
02:43:16.029 --> 02:43:19.018
(cheering)

4482
02:43:19.018 --> 02:43:20.997
MARISHA: Is he still in the grasp of the dude?

4483
02:43:20.997 --> 02:43:23.362
MATT: No, he fell off the moorbounder.

4484
02:43:23.362 --> 02:43:25.603
LIAM: I was being shoved in its gut or something.

4485
02:43:25.603 --> 02:43:28.145
MARISHA: Is he still clutched by him?

4486
02:43:28.145 --> 02:43:30.146
MATT: He's not grappled anymore,

4487
02:43:30.146 --> 02:43:31.277
from a flavor standpoint,

4488
02:43:31.277 --> 02:43:33.036
it was trying to stuff him into its body

4489
02:43:33.036 --> 02:43:34.596
in a really fucked up way.

4490
02:43:34.596 --> 02:43:35.544
He comes back to consciousness,

4491
02:43:35.544 --> 02:43:37.136
you're technically grappled.

4492
02:43:37.136 --> 02:43:38.128
TALIESIN: Now I'm going to try,

4493
02:43:38.128 --> 02:43:40.154
I'm taking a defensive stance.

4494
02:43:40.154 --> 02:43:40.996
MATT: You've got it, all right.

4495
02:43:40.996 --> 02:43:42.376
That finishes your turn, Caduceus.

4496
02:43:42.376 --> 02:43:43.797
Up at the top, Beau, you're up.

4497
02:43:43.797 --> 02:43:45.378
MARISHA: Okay, seeing what this guy's

4498
02:43:45.378 --> 02:43:46.337
trying to do to Caleb,

4499
02:43:46.337 --> 02:43:48.938
I'm like: Ahh, no sir!

4500
02:43:48.938 --> 02:43:52.530
I grab him by his head and yank him back.

4501
02:43:53.677 --> 02:43:54.510
TRAVIS: No sir!

4502
02:43:54.510 --> 02:43:56.366
MARISHA: I start fucking jabbing him in the ribs.

4503
02:43:56.366 --> 02:43:58.137
TALIESIN: Yeah!
LIAM: Awesome.

4504
02:43:58.137 --> 02:43:59.288
MARISHA: Natural 20!

4505
02:43:59.288 --> 02:44:02.426
(cheering)

4506
02:44:02.426 --> 02:44:04.077
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for this!

4507
02:44:04.077 --> 02:44:04.910
MATT: All right.

4508
02:44:04.910 --> 02:44:06.904
MARISHA: I rolled a five, so that's ten,

4509
02:44:06.904 --> 02:44:09.652
plus another six, 16 damage on that one.

4510
02:44:09.652 --> 02:44:10.761
MATT: 16 points of damage.

4511
02:44:10.761 --> 02:44:12.302
SAM: It's trying to put Caleb in its "Fajara."

4512
02:44:12.302 --> 02:44:13.290
MARISHA: Fajara!

4513
02:44:13.290 --> 02:44:15.540
(laughter)

4514
02:44:17.167 --> 02:44:18.167
MATT: All right.

4515
02:44:20.192 --> 02:44:21.525
MARISHA: Attacking again.

4516
02:44:21.525 --> 02:44:23.410
LIAM: (like Nott) That's a lot of Fajara.

4517
02:44:23.410 --> 02:44:25.075
MARISHA: 27 to hit.

4518
02:44:25.075 --> 02:44:25.996
MATT: 27 to hit, it hits, yeah.

4519
02:44:25.996 --> 02:44:26.866
MARISHA: 12 damage.

4520
02:44:26.866 --> 02:44:29.456
MATT: All right, how do you want to do this?

4521
02:44:29.456 --> 02:44:30.877
MARISHA: I have him by the neck,

4522
02:44:30.877 --> 02:44:32.205
and I jab him in the ribs,

4523
02:44:32.205 --> 02:44:33.627
and then I'm going to take,

4524
02:44:33.627 --> 02:44:35.435
I'm going to do a full neck snap.

4525
02:44:35.435 --> 02:44:38.545
MATT: (cracking) You hear this sickening break noise,

4526
02:44:38.545 --> 02:44:39.957
its head, (groaning).

4527
02:44:39.957 --> 02:44:41.317
Its horrible moan gets cut off

4528
02:44:41.317 --> 02:44:42.907
as its windpipe is pinched.

4529
02:44:42.907 --> 02:44:44.547
It collapses to the ground

4530
02:44:44.547 --> 02:44:46.637
as Caleb pulls his head

4531
02:44:46.637 --> 02:44:49.016
out of the interior of its abdomen,

4532
02:44:49.016 --> 02:44:51.445
just black with gore.

4533
02:44:51.445 --> 02:44:52.278
MARISHA: Ugh!

4534
02:44:53.396 --> 02:44:55.557
You were almost like ravioli stuffing.

4535
02:44:55.557 --> 02:44:57.441
MATT: You still have your movement, bonus.

4536
02:44:57.441 --> 02:44:59.568
SAM: Beau just invented ravioli, canon.

4537
02:44:59.568 --> 02:45:01.882
(laughter)

4538
02:45:01.882 --> 02:45:05.376
TALIESIN: Canon! Canon in a can. Boom!

4539
02:45:05.376 --> 02:45:07.539
MARISHA: 1200 years before Italy!

4540
02:45:07.539 --> 02:45:12.539
(laughter)

4541
02:45:13.077 --> 02:45:14.442
I can still move?

4542
02:45:14.442 --> 02:45:15.275
MATT: Yes, you can.

4543
02:45:15.275 --> 02:45:17.221
MARISHA: Can I get to the one that's harass--

4544
02:45:17.221 --> 02:45:18.973
or, ooh, bats.

4545
02:45:18.973 --> 02:45:20.670
TALIESIN: Or bats. Up to you.

4546
02:45:20.670 --> 02:45:21.792
MARISHA: Can I punch bats?

4547
02:45:21.792 --> 02:45:23.970
MATT: Yeah, you can punch bats!

4548
02:45:23.970 --> 02:45:25.037
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (punching sounds)

4549
02:45:25.037 --> 02:45:26.978
TALIESIN: Who hasn't punched a bat before?

4550
02:45:26.978 --> 02:45:28.257
TRAVIS: Speed bag action.

4551
02:45:28.257 --> 02:45:29.581
SAM: You can punch a ghost.

4552
02:45:29.581 --> 02:45:31.704
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

4553
02:45:31.704 --> 02:45:35.264
I break that douchebag's neck,

4554
02:45:35.264 --> 02:45:37.365
and then I look up and I see the bats,

4555
02:45:37.365 --> 02:45:40.474
and I pull out my staff.

4556
02:45:40.474 --> 02:45:41.307
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4557
02:45:41.307 --> 02:45:43.805
MARISHA: I start doing the whirlwind.

4558
02:45:43.805 --> 02:45:45.131
Walking towards the bats.

4559
02:45:45.131 --> 02:45:48.486
TALIESIN: My, bats are a superstitious, cowardly lot.

4560
02:45:48.486 --> 02:45:49.785
MATT: All right, so as you move through,

4561
02:45:49.785 --> 02:45:51.286
(whirring)

4562
02:45:51.286 --> 02:45:52.705
Yeah, you can move through the bats to get over there.

4563
02:45:52.705 --> 02:45:54.076
So we'll say.

4564
02:45:54.076 --> 02:45:55.326
We'll put you over here,

4565
02:45:55.326 --> 02:45:57.105
you actually go directly through it.

4566
02:45:57.105 --> 02:45:58.454
(whirring)

4567
02:45:58.454 --> 02:46:00.574
Are you using your--

4568
02:46:00.574 --> 02:46:01.755
MARISHA: Oh yeah, am I doing stuff?

4569
02:46:01.755 --> 02:46:02.716
LIAM: Catch him, derry!

4570
02:46:02.716 --> 02:46:04.129
MATT: Are you doing anything with your bonus action?

4571
02:46:04.129 --> 02:46:05.287
MARISHA: Oh, I have a bonus action!

4572
02:46:05.287 --> 02:46:06.120
MATT: Yeah!

4573
02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:09.225
MARISHA: Yeah, I hit them with my stick!

4574
02:46:09.225 --> 02:46:10.246
20!

4575
02:46:10.246 --> 02:46:11.263
MATT: That hits.

4576
02:46:11.263 --> 02:46:13.788
MARISHA: Oh wait, that's a-- I roll d8 for my stick.

4577
02:46:13.788 --> 02:46:15.166
MATT" Well, you can't use your stick as a bonus action,

4578
02:46:15.166 --> 02:46:16.348
because it's your off, it's your--

4579
02:46:16.348 --> 02:46:17.181
MARISHA: Oh, okay, okay.

4580
02:46:17.181 --> 02:46:18.116
MATT: For flavor, we're saying it's your stick.

4581
02:46:18.116 --> 02:46:20.417
MARISHA: Well, for flavor, my stick.

4582
02:46:20.417 --> 02:46:21.337
12 damage.

4583
02:46:21.337 --> 02:46:22.170
MATT: 12 damage!

4584
02:46:22.170 --> 02:46:23.011
SAM: Wow!

4585
02:46:23.011 --> 02:46:25.003
MARISHA: I'm rolling really well today!

4586
02:46:25.003 --> 02:46:27.950
MARISHA: Bless the dice gods tonight!

4587
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:29.999
MATT: You take out four or five more bats,

4588
02:46:29.999 --> 02:46:33.098
as you're spinning it, you come out the other side of it.

4589
02:46:33.098 --> 02:46:35.649
It's still a swarm, it's hard to get a grasp on,

4590
02:46:35.649 --> 02:46:36.489
but you're beating them away,

4591
02:46:36.489 --> 02:46:37.322
it's taking some damage.

4592
02:46:37.322 --> 02:46:38.897
MARISHA: Full-on old lady with a broom.

4593
02:46:38.897 --> 02:46:40.246
MATT: Yep. Essentially.

4594
02:46:40.246 --> 02:46:41.079
All right, that finishes your go, Beau.

4595
02:46:41.079 --> 02:46:42.337
Yasha, you're up.

4596
02:46:42.337 --> 02:46:43.895
Jester, you're on deck.

4597
02:46:43.895 --> 02:46:45.340
ASHLEY: So.

4598
02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:46.830
SAM: I'm going to crouch down just in case.

4599
02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:48.326
ASHLEY: Since I was,

4600
02:46:48.326 --> 02:46:51.081
I was not hit, I have to rage again.

4601
02:46:51.081 --> 02:46:52.481
MATT: You attacked last turn.

4602
02:46:52.481 --> 02:46:54.479
Either you have to attack, or be attacked.

4603
02:46:54.479 --> 02:46:55.909
ASHLEY: I know this, I know.

4604
02:46:55.909 --> 02:46:57.260
I'm so sorry.

4605
02:46:57.260 --> 02:46:58.093
MATT: It's all good.

4606
02:46:58.093 --> 02:46:58.926
ASHLEY: Okay.

4607
02:46:58.926 --> 02:46:59.759
So I, yeah.

4608
02:46:59.759 --> 02:47:02.100
Can I try to make my way

4609
02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:04.340
to this guy over here?

4610
02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:05.500
MATT: Yeah, you could try.

4611
02:47:05.500 --> 02:47:06.333
ASHEY: -- trying to attack Fjord.

4612
02:47:06.333 --> 02:47:09.029
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20,

4613
02:47:09.029 --> 02:47:12.020
25, 30, 35, you can get around that way

4614
02:47:12.020 --> 02:47:13.203
by moving through Fjord

4615
02:47:13.203 --> 02:47:14.603
because you can move through your allies.

4616
02:47:14.603 --> 02:47:16.059
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. All right.

4617
02:47:16.059 --> 02:47:16.899
TALIESIN: You're having a bad day, man.

4618
02:47:16.899 --> 02:47:18.292
TRAVIS: (panicked) You're not lying!

4619
02:47:18.292 --> 02:47:20.286
SAM: Are you going to do your

4620
02:47:20.286 --> 02:47:22.006
new sword or your...

4621
02:47:22.006 --> 02:47:23.748
ASHLEY: It's the same. New sword.

4622
02:47:23.748 --> 02:47:25.087
Okay, okay.

4623
02:47:25.087 --> 02:47:27.887
LIAM: She's going full GWAR.

4624
02:47:29.047 --> 02:47:29.916
ASHLEY: 14.

4625
02:47:29.916 --> 02:47:31.436
MATT: 14, just misses.

4626
02:47:31.436 --> 02:47:33.268
ASHLEY: Oh, I thought it just, okay.

4627
02:47:33.268 --> 02:47:34.435
Second attack.

4628
02:47:35.287 --> 02:47:37.577
MATT: Don't forget your--

4629
02:47:37.577 --> 02:47:38.410
TRAVIS: Reckless.

4630
02:47:38.410 --> 02:47:39.417
MATT: Reckless, whenever you want to do that.

4631
02:47:39.417 --> 02:47:42.097
ASHLEY: I just rolled a natural 19 for the second attack.

4632
02:47:42.097 --> 02:47:43.187
MATT: Okay, great.

4633
02:47:43.187 --> 02:47:44.020
SAM: Is that a crit for you?

4634
02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:44.853
LAURA: No, no.

4635
02:47:44.853 --> 02:47:45.716
MATT: But it hits.

4636
02:47:45.716 --> 02:47:48.566
ASHLEY: Well, it's for the Skingorger.

4637
02:47:48.566 --> 02:47:50.255
MATT: You couldn't use the weapon last turn

4638
02:47:50.255 --> 02:47:52.654
because you had to use your bonus action to--

4639
02:47:52.654 --> 02:47:54.244
LAURA: You didn't take that point of exhaustion.

4640
02:47:54.244 --> 02:47:55.684
ASHLEY: I didn't take that point of exhaustion.

4641
02:47:55.684 --> 02:47:56.682
MATT: Yeah, you had to rage

4642
02:47:56.682 --> 02:47:57.705
to keep the rage going last turn.

4643
02:47:57.705 --> 02:47:59.714
ASHLEY: I see, so to use--

4644
02:47:59.714 --> 02:48:01.614
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 19.

4645
02:48:01.614 --> 02:48:02.756
ASHLEY: If I use the, oh,

4646
02:48:02.756 --> 02:48:04.413
that's if I get the point of exhaustion.

4647
02:48:04.413 --> 02:48:06.047
MATT: Correct, if you use the ability for the next minute,

4648
02:48:06.047 --> 02:48:07.705
that's where your crit chance goes up by one,

4649
02:48:07.705 --> 02:48:08.914
and you do the additional damage.

4650
02:48:08.914 --> 02:48:10.154
TRAVIS: It's like the whole fight.
ASHLEY: I see.

4651
02:48:10.154 --> 02:48:11.535
Okay.

4652
02:48:11.535 --> 02:48:12.887
TALIESIN: Oh ho!

4653
02:48:12.887 --> 02:48:14.220
ASHLEY: Ten, okay, 15.

4654
02:48:15.294 --> 02:48:16.407
MATT: 15.

4655
02:48:16.407 --> 02:48:17.516
ASHLEY: Points of damage.

4656
02:48:17.516 --> 02:48:18.349
Sorry.

4657
02:48:19.217 --> 02:48:21.316
16 points of damage.

4658
02:48:21.316 --> 02:48:22.766
MATT: Wait, with the second--

4659
02:48:22.766 --> 02:48:23.966
ASHLEY: On the second attack.

4660
02:48:23.966 --> 02:48:24.799
MATT: Right, okay.

4661
02:48:27.097 --> 02:48:28.014
You got it.

4662
02:48:29.065 --> 02:48:30.087
It's looking hurt.

4663
02:48:30.087 --> 02:48:31.263
It's looking real hurt.

4664
02:48:31.263 --> 02:48:32.156
As you carve past the blade,

4665
02:48:32.156 --> 02:48:34.276
it actually, as you bring it down the second time,

4666
02:48:34.276 --> 02:48:35.406
(blade impact)

4667
02:48:35.406 --> 02:48:37.607
and it embeds itself a good foot into its chest,

4668
02:48:37.607 --> 02:48:38.475
and it's like,

4669
02:48:38.475 --> 02:48:40.076
it tried to stop it with its claws,

4670
02:48:40.076 --> 02:48:42.287
and you watch two of its pointed arms

4671
02:48:42.287 --> 02:48:44.487
just get severed and then all these

4672
02:48:44.487 --> 02:48:46.337
arched stumps that are bleeding out

4673
02:48:46.337 --> 02:48:47.877
as it goes, (wailing).

4674
02:48:47.877 --> 02:48:48.985
TRAVIS: No!

4675
02:48:51.967 --> 02:48:53.076
MATT: That finish your turn, Yasha?

4676
02:48:53.076 --> 02:48:54.236
ASHLEY: I, it does.

4677
02:48:54.236 --> 02:48:55.847
MATT: Jester, you're up.

4678
02:48:55.847 --> 02:48:56.680
LAURA: Okay.

4679
02:48:57.785 --> 02:49:00.156
Why not for some flavor.

4680
02:49:00.156 --> 02:49:03.125
I'm going to leap off the moorbounder!

4681
02:49:03.125 --> 02:49:03.958
SAM: Yeah!

4682
02:49:03.958 --> 02:49:05.646
LAURA: Pull out my battleaxe and try to swipe

4683
02:49:05.646 --> 02:49:07.785
at its head with my axe.

4684
02:49:07.785 --> 02:49:08.618
MATT: Go for it.

4685
02:49:08.618 --> 02:49:10.217
As you leap off in the air,

4686
02:49:10.217 --> 02:49:12.241
battleaxe downward, roll for your attack.

4687
02:49:12.241 --> 02:49:13.634
LAURA: Okay!

4688
02:49:13.634 --> 02:49:16.465
(laughter)

4689
02:49:16.465 --> 02:49:18.785
Aw man! (laughs)

4690
02:49:18.785 --> 02:49:21.825
I don't need to do this axe thing!

4691
02:49:21.825 --> 02:49:24.367
Eight plus five is, not enough.

4692
02:49:24.367 --> 02:49:25.465
That's 13.

4693
02:49:25.465 --> 02:49:27.196
MATT: As you jump, yaah!

4694
02:49:27.196 --> 02:49:28.113
In the air!

4695
02:49:30.605 --> 02:49:31.744
Catches nothing.

4696
02:49:31.744 --> 02:49:32.577
LAURA: Shit!

4697
02:49:32.577 --> 02:49:35.047
I cast Spiritual Weapon to make up for it!

4698
02:49:35.047 --> 02:49:37.027
MATT: Okay, there you go.

4699
02:49:37.027 --> 02:49:39.015
LAURA: I'll do it at 3rd-level, no,

4700
02:49:39.015 --> 02:49:42.836
that would be 4th-level to make it...

4701
02:49:42.836 --> 02:49:44.327
TALIESIN: The trees, the trees!

4702
02:49:44.327 --> 02:49:47.773
LAURA: Yeah, 4th-level, Spiritual Weapon.

4703
02:49:47.773 --> 02:49:48.772
MATT: Woof, all right!

4704
02:49:48.772 --> 02:49:51.076
LAURA: Bring it down to on his head.

4705
02:49:51.076 --> 02:49:51.966
MATT: So it's 2d8.

4706
02:49:51.966 --> 02:49:54.527
LAURA: Ooh, so that's my lollipop with serrated edges.

4707
02:49:54.527 --> 02:49:56.085
MATT: There you go. Serrated lollipop.

4708
02:49:56.085 --> 02:49:57.608
Go ahead and roll attack.

4709
02:49:57.608 --> 02:50:01.265
LAURA: (groans) Plus nine, 17.

4710
02:50:01.265 --> 02:50:02.098
MATT: 17 hits.

4711
02:50:02.098 --> 02:50:02.931
Go ahead and roll damage.

4712
02:50:02.931 --> 02:50:05.431
2d8 plus your wisdom modifier.

4713
02:50:06.487 --> 02:50:07.615
LAURA: Aww, then.

4714
02:50:07.615 --> 02:50:12.496
Plus, five, is...

4715
02:50:12.496 --> 02:50:13.329
12.

4716
02:50:13.329 --> 02:50:14.657
MATT: 12 points, how do you want to do this?

4717
02:50:14.657 --> 02:50:17.744
(cheering)

4718
02:50:17.744 --> 02:50:20.024
LAURA: Whiff with my axe, I go: Ew.

4719
02:50:20.024 --> 02:50:22.353
And the lollipop comes down,

4720
02:50:22.353 --> 02:50:24.015
and slams into its head

4721
02:50:24.015 --> 02:50:26.295
and smashes its head into its neck.

4722
02:50:26.295 --> 02:50:29.003
MATT: As you whiff, it turns, (whooshes).

4723
02:50:29.003 --> 02:50:31.036
(wailing)

4724
02:50:31.036 --> 02:50:32.602
(blade whirring)

4725
02:50:32.602 --> 02:50:34.956
It gets ground into the ground,

4726
02:50:34.956 --> 02:50:35.789
and it stops moving,

4727
02:50:35.789 --> 02:50:37.882
and then it, (impact) hits again.

4728
02:50:37.882 --> 02:50:40.137
(impact) Hits again.

4729
02:50:40.137 --> 02:50:41.692
LAURA: Yeah! See that?

4730
02:50:41.692 --> 02:50:43.425
That was the art of distraction.

4731
02:50:43.425 --> 02:50:44.775
ALL: Ooh!

4732
02:50:44.775 --> 02:50:46.855
LAURA: Yes.
ASHLEY: That was good.

4733
02:50:46.855 --> 02:50:49.756
MATT: We have bats on the battlefield.

4734
02:50:49.756 --> 02:50:52.116
So Jester, that finishes your turn.

4735
02:50:52.116 --> 02:50:53.533
Fjord, you're up.

4736
02:50:54.551 --> 02:50:55.801
TRAVIS: Fucking bats.

4737
02:50:57.695 --> 02:50:59.524
Eldritch Blast!

4738
02:50:59.524 --> 02:51:02.204
(laughter)

4739
02:51:03.242 --> 02:51:06.476
That is a 19, and a 21.

4740
02:51:06.476 --> 02:51:07.309
MATT: Both hit.

4741
02:51:07.309 --> 02:51:08.975
TRAVIS: Great.

4742
02:51:08.975 --> 02:51:09.808
That is, fuck.

4743
02:51:09.808 --> 02:51:13.044
Six points Eldritch Blast damage, and

4744
02:51:13.044 --> 02:51:15.098
14 points.

4745
02:51:15.098 --> 02:51:15.931
MATT: Six and then 14?

4746
02:51:15.931 --> 02:51:16.764
TRAVIS: Yes.

4747
02:51:16.764 --> 02:51:18.175
MATT: Total of 20.

4748
02:51:18.175 --> 02:51:19.055
How do you want to do this?

4749
02:51:19.055 --> 02:51:20.625
(laughter)

4750
02:51:20.625 --> 02:51:23.434
TRAVIS: As the giant lollipop comes down I'm like:

4751
02:51:23.434 --> 02:51:25.192
Well, fuck.

4752
02:51:25.192 --> 02:51:27.113
(blasting)

4753
02:51:27.113 --> 02:51:28.233
Over to the bats.

4754
02:51:28.233 --> 02:51:30.513
MATT: As the bats are flying over Caleb's

4755
02:51:30.513 --> 02:51:32.135
now-conscious body looking up.

4756
02:51:32.135 --> 02:51:35.027
TALIESIN: Scoot! Go on!

4757
02:51:37.913 --> 02:51:39.830
TRAVIS: He's just trying to coax them out!

4758
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:40.663
SAM: Git!

4759
02:51:41.722 --> 02:51:43.537
LAURA: Get out here!

4760
02:51:43.537 --> 02:51:44.701
MARISHA: Get going!

4761
02:51:44.701 --> 02:51:45.900
MATT: As you swing through once with your staff,

4762
02:51:45.900 --> 02:51:48.792
suddenly, there's two bursts of greenish energy.

4763
02:51:48.792 --> 02:51:50.975
(explosion) The bats just (shrieks).

4764
02:51:50.975 --> 02:51:52.641
(impact) The ground.
TRAVIS: Got them for you.

4765
02:51:52.641 --> 02:51:53.657
TALIESIN: I don't care.

4766
02:51:53.657 --> 02:51:55.724
(laughter)

4767
02:51:59.404 --> 02:52:01.245
MARISHA: Exterminator Fjord.

4768
02:52:01.245 --> 02:52:02.584
LIAM: Did you just holster your fingers?

4769
02:52:02.584 --> 02:52:04.092
TRAVIS: I did.
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

4770
02:52:04.092 --> 02:52:06.893
TRAVIS: No, because nobody cares, okay.

4771
02:52:06.893 --> 02:52:09.722
SAM: So the fight cost us an arm and a leg?

4772
02:52:09.722 --> 02:52:11.021
(groaning)

4773
02:52:11.021 --> 02:52:11.922
TALIESIN: No, no.

4774
02:52:11.922 --> 02:52:13.381
LAURA: Okay, so nighttime here?

4775
02:52:13.381 --> 02:52:15.693
Super duper bad, yeah?

4776
02:52:15.693 --> 02:52:18.792
TRAVIS: Makes them stronger, whatever it is.

4777
02:52:18.792 --> 02:52:19.625
Hey, as long as we got

4778
02:52:19.625 --> 02:52:21.958
the little glowing orb from, yeah.

4779
02:52:21.958 --> 02:52:23.774
SAM: How long's that last?

4780
02:52:23.774 --> 02:52:24.622
LIAM: A while.

4781
02:52:24.622 --> 02:52:27.245
TALIESIN: How you feeling, Mr. Caleb?

4782
02:52:27.245 --> 02:52:28.880
LIAM: I'm okay.

4783
02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:30.850
It's an hour, I think.

4784
02:52:30.850 --> 02:52:31.880
Let's look at the spell.

4785
02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:32.713
MARISHA: Kind of thought he was going

4786
02:52:32.713 --> 02:52:35.410
to bisect you for a second.

4787
02:52:35.410 --> 02:52:37.369
LAURA: Oh, I've got Mass Healing Word, you guys!

4788
02:52:37.369 --> 02:52:38.202
LIAM: Yeah, one hour.

4789
02:52:38.202 --> 02:52:39.410
SAM: I'll go inspect the bodies,

4790
02:52:39.410 --> 02:52:41.759
but you said they turn to paper or something?

4791
02:52:41.759 --> 02:52:44.109
MATT: When you see them die in the light,

4792
02:52:44.109 --> 02:52:45.972
you can see how fragile the bodies become.

4793
02:52:45.972 --> 02:52:50.431
It looks like long, dried papier mache

4794
02:52:50.431 --> 02:52:52.092
that begins to crack. As you begin

4795
02:52:52.092 --> 02:52:53.292
to check the body,

4796
02:52:53.292 --> 02:52:54.852
part of it breaks apart

4797
02:52:54.852 --> 02:52:57.681
and turns to thin paper ash.

4798
02:52:57.681 --> 02:52:59.492
SAM: There's nothing, they don't got nothing.

4799
02:52:59.492 --> 02:53:01.460
MATT: You can roll an investigation check.

4800
02:53:01.460 --> 02:53:03.751
TALIESIN: I'm going to very gently

4801
02:53:03.751 --> 02:53:04.652
check out one of these trees.

4802
02:53:04.652 --> 02:53:05.485
SAM: 27.

4803
02:53:05.485 --> 02:53:06.402
MATT: Okay, 27.

4804
02:53:07.588 --> 02:53:08.540
LAURA: You get 15 points--

4805
02:53:08.540 --> 02:53:09.380
MATT: Not much of interest.

4806
02:53:09.380 --> 02:53:13.361
You find some light papery skin

4807
02:53:13.361 --> 02:53:17.932
and lots of thick, nasty innards.

4808
02:53:17.932 --> 02:53:19.600
SAM: Okay, yeah, good to see.

4809
02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:20.433
MATT: You're doing what?

4810
02:53:20.433 --> 02:53:21.660
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look at this tree

4811
02:53:21.660 --> 02:53:22.721
that the bats came out of,

4812
02:53:22.721 --> 02:53:24.092
see if there was anything interesting about it.

4813
02:53:24.092 --> 02:53:26.732
MATT: Make a perception check.

4814
02:53:26.732 --> 02:53:28.452
TALIESIN: Ah, 12.

4815
02:53:28.452 --> 02:53:29.285
MATT: 12.

4816
02:53:30.281 --> 02:53:31.114
It looks like a tree,

4817
02:53:31.114 --> 02:53:34.201
it looks like it'd be a good place for bats to live.

4818
02:53:34.201 --> 02:53:36.041
TALIESIN: I'm going to maybe grab a little bit

4819
02:53:36.041 --> 02:53:37.871
of one of the mushrooms and put it in my pocket.

4820
02:53:37.871 --> 02:53:39.412
MATT: Okay. All right.

4821
02:53:39.412 --> 02:53:40.370
You look at it, this is a fungus

4822
02:53:40.370 --> 02:53:42.191
you haven't seen before.

4823
02:53:42.191 --> 02:53:46.379
It has a dull turquoise coloration to it.

4824
02:53:46.379 --> 02:53:49.219
The stalk is a gray.

4825
02:53:49.219 --> 02:53:51.000
It's unique. You've not encountered this.

4826
02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:52.399
TALIESIN: Put it in my little sample bag.

4827
02:53:52.399 --> 02:53:53.232
MATT: Okay.

4828
02:53:54.657 --> 02:53:56.150
LIAM: Starting to crawl through

4829
02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:58.400
around on the ground and picking up bats

4830
02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:01.169
and squishing out bat shit

4831
02:54:01.169 --> 02:54:03.086
into a rag that I keep.

4832
02:54:05.019 --> 02:54:06.352
MATT: All right. Collecting your guano.

4833
02:54:06.352 --> 02:54:07.985
TRAVIS: I check around the rock formation

4834
02:54:07.985 --> 02:54:09.064
just see if there was anything

4835
02:54:09.064 --> 02:54:11.998
they pulled from anybody that had come from

4836
02:54:11.998 --> 02:54:12.831
through here before.

4837
02:54:12.831 --> 02:54:15.307
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check

4838
02:54:15.307 --> 02:54:18.687
as you go through and look through it.

4839
02:54:18.687 --> 02:54:19.520
TRAVIS: 16.

4840
02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:21.103
MATT: 16, lot of bones.

4841
02:54:22.387 --> 02:54:23.465
A lot of corpses that have

4842
02:54:23.465 --> 02:54:26.014
since been grown over

4843
02:54:26.014 --> 02:54:28.557
with dry brush,

4844
02:54:28.557 --> 02:54:32.557
and other bits of very low land vegetation.

4845
02:54:33.880 --> 02:54:34.738
As you're getting a look at this,

4846
02:54:34.738 --> 02:54:37.388
around a lot of these formations

4847
02:54:37.388 --> 02:54:39.747
there seems to be a number of

4848
02:54:39.747 --> 02:54:40.899
types at vegetation that do

4849
02:54:40.899 --> 02:54:42.808
live and thrive here in these badlands,

4850
02:54:42.808 --> 02:54:45.165
but they mesh in with the rest of the color

4851
02:54:45.165 --> 02:54:47.368
and usually stick around other formations

4852
02:54:47.368 --> 02:54:50.689
that collect water, but yeah.

4853
02:54:50.689 --> 02:54:52.758
The number of creatures have fallen

4854
02:54:52.758 --> 02:54:55.091
and been dragged into space.

4855
02:54:56.008 --> 02:54:58.048
SAM: We're not in the Wildlands, right?

4856
02:54:58.048 --> 02:54:59.168
That's another place?

4857
02:54:59.168 --> 02:55:00.419
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we're in the--

4858
02:55:00.419 --> 02:55:01.819
MATT: Oh, the Greying Wildlands, no.

4859
02:55:01.819 --> 02:55:02.888
That's north.

4860
02:55:02.888 --> 02:55:03.721
You're far to the east.

4861
02:55:03.721 --> 02:55:05.749
TRAVIS: It's only getting darker, right?

4862
02:55:05.749 --> 02:55:06.582
MATT: Yeah.

4863
02:55:06.582 --> 02:55:07.428
At this point, as you guys have been searching,

4864
02:55:07.428 --> 02:55:11.076
the sun is down and you're looking at nighttime.

4865
02:55:11.076 --> 02:55:11.909
Pretty soon.

4866
02:55:11.909 --> 02:55:12.742
LAURA: Can I look at the area of the ground

4867
02:55:12.742 --> 02:55:14.206
that the creature came up out of

4868
02:55:14.206 --> 02:55:15.398
behind the formation and see,

4869
02:55:15.398 --> 02:55:17.766
does it look-- didn't it come up out of the ground at all

4870
02:55:17.766 --> 02:55:18.947
or was it just chilling?

4871
02:55:18.947 --> 02:55:20.735
MATT: Yeah, it was sitting and resting.

4872
02:55:20.735 --> 02:55:21.568
LAURA: Got it.

4873
02:55:21.568 --> 02:55:25.068
MATT: They seem to be called by your presence.

4874
02:55:26.176 --> 02:55:27.507
LAURA: Okay.

4875
02:55:27.507 --> 02:55:31.866
ASHLEY: Are there any of the barbed spires anywhere close by

4876
02:55:31.866 --> 02:55:34.787
that are coming out of the ground?

4877
02:55:34.787 --> 02:55:37.620
MATT: No, make a perception check.

4878
02:55:40.686 --> 02:55:41.585
ASHLEY: Oh no.

4879
02:55:41.585 --> 02:55:43.304
MATT: But disadvantage, because it is,

4880
02:55:43.304 --> 02:55:44.354
you have darkvision?

4881
02:55:44.354 --> 02:55:46.852
Yeah, you're fine, what did you roll?

4882
02:55:46.852 --> 02:55:47.685
ASHLEY: 22.

4883
02:55:47.685 --> 02:55:49.672
MATT: 22, it's hard to see,

4884
02:55:49.672 --> 02:55:50.505
and the only reason you can see

4885
02:55:50.505 --> 02:55:51.574
is there's a little bit of moonlight

4886
02:55:51.574 --> 02:55:53.952
that's peeking through some of the clouds.

4887
02:55:53.952 --> 02:55:56.854
The sky's opened up for the nighttime bit

4888
02:55:56.854 --> 02:55:57.942
and little bit of the white moonlight.

4889
02:55:57.942 --> 02:55:59.742
You can see the outer shape

4890
02:55:59.742 --> 02:56:01.454
of two larger spires

4891
02:56:01.454 --> 02:56:03.502
on the horizon, you're not sure the distance.

4892
02:56:03.502 --> 02:56:04.335
ASHLEY: Okay.

4893
02:56:04.335 --> 02:56:05.275
MATT: You can see that there are a few

4894
02:56:05.275 --> 02:56:07.024
in the direction that you're traveling.

4895
02:56:07.024 --> 02:56:08.336
ASHLEY: Okay.

4896
02:56:08.336 --> 02:56:10.256
LAURA: Were these creatures anything like

4897
02:56:10.256 --> 02:56:12.024
anything we would have heard of before

4898
02:56:12.024 --> 02:56:13.624
in storybooks or...

4899
02:56:13.624 --> 02:56:17.707
MATT: You can make a religion or an arcana check.

4900
02:56:25.286 --> 02:56:26.119
LAURA: Ten.

4901
02:56:26.119 --> 02:56:27.595
MATT: Ten?

4902
02:56:27.595 --> 02:56:28.944
You're not entirely sure what these things are.

4903
02:56:28.944 --> 02:56:32.111
There's something about them that,

4904
02:56:33.616 --> 02:56:37.199
they don't seem to be from Exandria.

4905
02:56:38.161 --> 02:56:39.683
At least, their essence doesn't seem to be

4906
02:56:39.683 --> 02:56:44.471
something that would naturally exist on this plane.

4907
02:56:44.471 --> 02:56:46.032
TRAVIS: Plus that light sensitivity.

4908
02:56:46.032 --> 02:56:49.811
LAURA: They seemed so sad. (sighs)

4909
02:56:49.811 --> 02:56:51.622
TRAVIS: Should we dome up for the night?

4910
02:56:51.622 --> 02:56:52.930
LIAM: Yeah, one minute.

4911
02:56:52.930 --> 02:56:55.646
I'm feeding bats to Jannik.

4912
02:56:55.646 --> 02:56:57.849
TALIESIN: Also, if we're closing up,

4913
02:56:57.849 --> 02:57:01.640
maybe it's time to have a couple of these conversations.

4914
02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:02.620
SAM: Oh, the Sending

4915
02:57:02.620 --> 02:57:04.832
and all the cleric stuff

4916
02:57:04.832 --> 02:57:07.462
that you can only do after 7:00pm?

4917
02:57:07.462 --> 02:57:08.295
LAURA: Yeah.

4918
02:57:08.295 --> 02:57:10.954
SAM: Cool.
LAURA: That stuff.

4919
02:57:10.954 --> 02:57:15.472
I'd rather do it in the tent, the dome, whatever.

4920
02:57:15.472 --> 02:57:16.923
I don't like this place.

4921
02:57:16.923 --> 02:57:18.671
TRAVIS: We can talk to a head in the meantime.

4922
02:57:18.671 --> 02:57:19.912
LIAM: I do the bedtime routine

4923
02:57:19.912 --> 02:57:22.533
and start putting up the dome and the wire.

4924
02:57:22.533 --> 02:57:24.590
MARISHA: I gather a little bit of dried brush

4925
02:57:24.590 --> 02:57:26.774
and make a little bit of a fire.

4926
02:57:26.774 --> 02:57:28.852
For warmth and light.

4927
02:57:28.852 --> 02:57:30.864
TALIESIN: Which one first?

4928
02:57:30.864 --> 02:57:32.214
SAM: Who are we calling?

4929
02:57:32.214 --> 02:57:33.694
LAURA: The hobgoblin first.

4930
02:57:33.694 --> 02:57:35.977
SAM: Oh! We're going to talk to the dead.

4931
02:57:35.977 --> 02:57:37.424
TALIESIN: Five questions.

4932
02:57:37.424 --> 02:57:38.257
MATT: Okay.

4933
02:57:40.064 --> 02:57:42.592
You have the ball still giving off daylight as well?

4934
02:57:42.592 --> 02:57:44.203
LIAM: It's got an hour total.

4935
02:57:44.203 --> 02:57:45.036
MATT: Okay.

4936
02:57:45.036 --> 02:57:47.003
LIAM: We're five minutes in, ten minutes in.

4937
02:57:47.003 --> 02:57:47.839
MATT: Okay.

4938
02:57:47.839 --> 02:57:49.682
LAURA: -- look like that guy.

4939
02:57:49.682 --> 02:57:53.869
TRAVIS: Also, a really good beacon for where we are.

4940
02:57:53.869 --> 02:57:55.369
SAM: We're in a dome. We're okay.

4941
02:57:56.731 --> 02:57:58.588
TRAVIS: Can light escape the dome?

4942
02:57:58.588 --> 02:58:01.503
MATT: Is the fire in the dome?

4943
02:58:01.503 --> 02:58:03.270
MARISHA: I, that was my thinking.

4944
02:58:03.270 --> 02:58:05.302
I don't know if, yeah.

4945
02:58:05.302 --> 02:58:08.102
LIAM: Then the dome doesn't trap in smoke or anything,

4946
02:58:08.102 --> 02:58:09.470
it just doesn't let things in.

4947
02:58:09.470 --> 02:58:12.920
It also can illuminate from the inside itself

4948
02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:15.030
and that doesn't go out of the dome.

4949
02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:15.891
LAURA: Okay, that's cool.

4950
02:58:15.891 --> 02:58:18.822
TRAVIS: Oh, so, it keeps light in?

4951
02:58:18.822 --> 02:58:20.590
LIAM: It generates its own light, I believe.

4952
02:58:20.590 --> 02:58:21.937
Let me re-check the spell.
MATT: Correct, but it is opaque,

4953
02:58:21.937 --> 02:58:24.345
meaning creatures can't see what's inside the dome.

4954
02:58:24.345 --> 02:58:26.211
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Cool.

4955
02:58:26.211 --> 02:58:27.819
Hey, Fjord. Should we ask him...

4956
02:58:27.819 --> 02:58:30.011
TALIESIN: We should, yeah.

4957
02:58:30.011 --> 02:58:32.960
LAURA: If we talk to this dead hobgoblin--

4958
02:58:32.960 --> 02:58:33.793
TRAVIS: Yep.

4959
02:58:33.793 --> 02:58:35.390
LAURA: We think maybe you should

4960
02:58:35.390 --> 02:58:38.411
make yourself look like the drow guy he was with.

4961
02:58:38.411 --> 02:58:40.480
Because you can sound like him, yeah?

4962
02:58:40.480 --> 02:58:41.847
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.
MARISHA: That's cool.

4963
02:58:41.847 --> 02:58:43.778
LAURA: You're really good at impersonating people,

4964
02:58:43.778 --> 02:58:44.613
after all.

4965
02:58:44.613 --> 02:58:48.050
TRAVIS: Yeah, he sounded like,

4966
02:58:48.050 --> 02:58:49.782
higher-crust, right?

4967
02:58:49.782 --> 02:58:50.615
Okay.

4968
02:58:50.615 --> 02:58:52.382
TALIESIN: Can you wear his face as well?

4969
02:58:52.382 --> 02:58:53.215
TRAVIS: Sure.

4970
02:58:54.465 --> 02:58:55.739
Yep, I remember.

4971
02:58:55.739 --> 02:59:00.572
I'll use Mask of Many Faces to look like <i>el</i> drow dude.

4972
02:59:01.867 --> 02:59:03.168
SAM: <i>El</i> drow blast.

4973
02:59:03.168 --> 02:59:05.356
(laughter)

4974
02:59:05.356 --> 02:59:06.758
MARISHA: What are we asking?

4975
02:59:06.758 --> 02:59:08.219
TRAVIS: How does this look?

4976
02:59:08.219 --> 02:59:10.278
ALL: Ooh!

4977
02:59:10.278 --> 02:59:11.318
TALIESIN: It's very impressive.

4978
02:59:11.318 --> 02:59:12.208
Not bad.

4979
02:59:12.208 --> 02:59:13.785
I'm going to give you some ground rules

4980
02:59:13.785 --> 02:59:15.025
before we go into this.

4981
02:59:15.025 --> 02:59:15.858
TRAVIS: All right.

4982
02:59:15.858 --> 02:59:19.166
TALIESIN: You only get five questions.

4983
02:59:19.166 --> 02:59:20.357
This person, whoever they are,

4984
02:59:20.357 --> 02:59:22.347
they're gone now, you're not talking to them.

4985
02:59:22.347 --> 02:59:23.787
You're just talking to an echo,

4986
02:59:23.787 --> 02:59:25.927
it's a memory, there's not anything

4987
02:59:25.927 --> 02:59:27.127
that can be bargained with,

4988
02:59:27.127 --> 02:59:29.107
there's nothing that can be tricked.

4989
02:59:29.107 --> 02:59:32.219
So this is just a reflection.

4990
02:59:32.219 --> 02:59:33.518
LIAM: Can it lie?

4991
02:59:33.518 --> 02:59:34.638
TALIESIN: Yes, it can lie.

4992
02:59:34.638 --> 02:59:35.728
LIAM: So okay.

4993
02:59:35.728 --> 02:59:37.955
LAURA: That's why we're making him look like his boss.

4994
02:59:37.955 --> 02:59:38.848
TALIESIN: It will have no reason to think

4995
02:59:38.848 --> 02:59:40.310
you aren't who you are.

4996
02:59:40.310 --> 02:59:41.143
You have to remember

4997
02:59:41.143 --> 02:59:44.328
that it also thinks you know what you know.

4998
02:59:44.328 --> 02:59:46.829
So when you ask it questions,

4999
02:59:46.829 --> 02:59:48.048
you have to do so in a way

5000
02:59:48.048 --> 02:59:50.019
that is familiar and open

5001
02:59:50.019 --> 02:59:51.779
and with the understanding

5002
02:59:51.779 --> 02:59:53.728
that you two have a bond.

5003
02:59:53.728 --> 02:59:56.549
TRAVIS: We didn't catch this guy's name, did we?

5004
02:59:56.549 --> 02:59:59.939
TALIESIN: Won't matter if you do it right.

5005
02:59:59.939 --> 03:00:00.772
TRAVIS: Well, we won't ask it.

5006
03:00:00.772 --> 03:00:03.028
LAURA: I can send him a message and ask him.

5007
03:00:03.028 --> 03:00:05.470
Hey, what was the name of that hobgoblin you were with?

5008
03:00:05.470 --> 03:00:06.918
SAM: No, what was your name.

5009
03:00:06.918 --> 03:00:10.835
LAURA: Also, what was your name, I can fit it all in.

5010
03:00:11.819 --> 03:00:15.718
TRAVIS: Maybe we just stick to whatever we want to ask him.

5011
03:00:15.718 --> 03:00:18.301
TALIESIN: I recommend "friend" as always.

5012
03:00:19.388 --> 03:00:20.221
TRAVIS: Friend.

5013
03:00:20.221 --> 03:00:21.054
TALIESIN: Or as little as possible,

5014
03:00:21.054 --> 03:00:23.779
you don't have to, there's nobody there you have to,

5015
03:00:23.779 --> 03:00:25.518
this is just a body now.

5016
03:00:25.518 --> 03:00:26.739
LAURA: He didn't seem like the type of person

5017
03:00:26.739 --> 03:00:28.277
that would say friend, FYI,

5018
03:00:28.277 --> 03:00:30.669
when I had the little talk with him before.

5019
03:00:30.669 --> 03:00:32.979
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe just, "Hey."

5020
03:00:32.979 --> 03:00:36.339
TRAVIS: (British accent) Do we have a request for questions?

5021
03:00:36.339 --> 03:00:37.318
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

5022
03:00:37.318 --> 03:00:41.270
MARISHA: Well, we want to know what they were handing off.

5023
03:00:41.270 --> 03:00:43.796
What they bought with their 50 platinum.

5024
03:00:43.796 --> 03:00:47.950
SAM: Also where in Bozostan--

5025
03:00:47.950 --> 03:00:49.139
LAURA: Bazostan.

5026
03:00:49.139 --> 03:00:53.856
SAM: Bozogaz, Exxon, do they reside?

5027
03:00:54.758 --> 03:00:57.758
TALIESIN: Just say that you need their help.

5028
03:00:59.709 --> 03:01:01.588
TRAVIS: Help for what?

5029
03:01:01.588 --> 03:01:04.328
TALIESIN: Answering these questions.

5030
03:01:04.328 --> 03:01:05.161
Your mind is hazy

5031
03:01:05.161 --> 03:01:07.539
and you need help getting home.

5032
03:01:07.539 --> 03:01:08.758
What were you handing off--

5033
03:01:08.758 --> 03:01:10.728
MATT: Just as a note, so you should know

5034
03:01:10.728 --> 03:01:13.648
the spell Speak With Dead is you asking the questions.

5035
03:01:13.648 --> 03:01:14.687
TALIESIN: Oh, I have to do it?

5036
03:01:14.687 --> 03:01:17.310
I was looking, because I think it said

5037
03:01:17.310 --> 03:01:18.356
that anyone could.

5038
03:01:18.356 --> 03:01:20.336
TRAVIS: I can point them to you.

5039
03:01:20.336 --> 03:01:22.638
MATT: But that is what can be done.

5040
03:01:22.638 --> 03:01:23.471
Because,

5041
03:01:24.318 --> 03:01:26.365
as it says, it says, "<i>You</i> can ask the corpse

5042
03:01:26.365 --> 03:01:27.456
"up to five questions,"

5043
03:01:27.456 --> 03:01:29.254
referring to the caster.

5044
03:01:29.254 --> 03:01:30.435
TRAVIS: I can frame that.

5045
03:01:30.435 --> 03:01:31.766
Be like...

5046
03:01:31.766 --> 03:01:32.599
I can...

5047
03:01:32.599 --> 03:01:34.286
LIAM: If we wait another day,

5048
03:01:34.286 --> 03:01:36.806
I can make you look like this fellow.

5049
03:01:36.806 --> 03:01:38.355
TALIESIN: I've got an idea.

5050
03:01:38.355 --> 03:01:39.188
LIAM: Okay.

5051
03:01:39.188 --> 03:01:40.021
LAURA: He can look like it, too,

5052
03:01:40.021 --> 03:01:41.387
but Fjord can sound like him.

5053
03:01:41.387 --> 03:01:45.554
TALIESIN: I'm going to make myself look like Blondie bear.

5054
03:01:46.475 --> 03:01:47.595
LAURA: Ooh!

5055
03:01:47.595 --> 03:01:48.595
TRAVIS: So I look like the drow

5056
03:01:48.595 --> 03:01:50.664
and you look like the blonde guy?

5057
03:01:50.664 --> 03:01:51.704
LAURA and MARISHA: Greg?

5058
03:01:51.704 --> 03:01:53.287
TALIESIN: Greg blonde-head.

5059
03:01:54.414 --> 03:01:55.247
MATT: Okay.

5060
03:02:00.648 --> 03:02:04.019
TRAVIS: Do you sound like the blonde-haired guy?

5061
03:02:04.019 --> 03:02:05.685
TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: Because you're going to ask questions

5062
03:02:05.685 --> 03:02:06.518
Okay.

5063
03:02:08.438 --> 03:02:11.771
SAM: I'll make myself look like Maruo.

5064
03:02:12.918 --> 03:02:13.751
LAURA: I'll make myself look like

5065
03:02:13.751 --> 03:02:15.358
the bugbear that was invisible.

5066
03:02:15.358 --> 03:02:17.497
TALIESIN: I'm actually, I've had a weird question

5067
03:02:17.497 --> 03:02:19.910
with this guy, how can I,

5068
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:22.568
can I decide even the state of myself

5069
03:02:22.568 --> 03:02:24.190
when I put on--
MATT: Yeah.

5070
03:02:24.190 --> 03:02:28.172
TALIESIN: I'm going to be torn up a bit.

5071
03:02:28.172 --> 03:02:29.230
I'm going to have some damage.

5072
03:02:29.230 --> 03:02:30.648
MATT: Okay.

5073
03:02:30.648 --> 03:02:31.768
TALIESIN: I'm going to look like I've been in a fight

5074
03:02:31.768 --> 03:02:34.939
and a lot of, some throat and chest damage.

5075
03:02:34.939 --> 03:02:37.048
MATT: Okay. The rest of you guys doing anything?

5076
03:02:37.048 --> 03:02:37.998
LIAM: Invisibility.

5077
03:02:37.998 --> 03:02:39.202
MARISHA: I'm going to step away.

5078
03:02:39.202 --> 03:02:41.597
ASHLEY: Yes. Step behind so it doesn't see.

5079
03:02:41.597 --> 03:02:43.263
MARISHA: Yeah. Step behind.

5080
03:02:43.263 --> 03:02:45.430
TALIESIN: Just start rolling this.

5081
03:02:51.639 --> 03:02:54.070
Let's do number one.

5082
03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:55.847
MATT: You burn the incense,

5083
03:02:55.847 --> 03:02:58.328
you reach out and touch the disembodied head

5084
03:02:58.328 --> 03:03:01.230
of the hobgoblin that you had slain

5085
03:03:01.230 --> 03:03:02.480
the day before.

5086
03:03:05.728 --> 03:03:09.219
You hear this weird sucking sound

5087
03:03:09.219 --> 03:03:13.207
as it tries to draw air through a severed neck.

5088
03:03:13.207 --> 03:03:16.957
(gurgling, rasping)

5089
03:03:17.870 --> 03:03:19.179
Its eyes flicker open

5090
03:03:19.179 --> 03:03:20.679
and just look out,

5091
03:03:23.182 --> 03:03:24.931
and move in their sockets dryly

5092
03:03:24.931 --> 03:03:28.942
across the somewhat congealed moisture in the sockets

5093
03:03:28.942 --> 03:03:30.751
towards you, Caduceus.

5094
03:03:30.751 --> 03:03:34.181
TRAVIS: I step behind Caduceus's shoulder and say:

5095
03:03:34.181 --> 03:03:38.482
My friend, it is so good to see you again.

5096
03:03:38.482 --> 03:03:41.751
Do me a favor, time is very short.

5097
03:03:41.751 --> 03:03:43.459
Answer my friend's questions here

5098
03:03:43.459 --> 03:03:44.490
as quickly as you can,

5099
03:03:44.490 --> 03:03:46.602
I have pressing business elsewhere.

5100
03:03:46.602 --> 03:03:47.528
I walk away.

5101
03:03:47.528 --> 03:03:49.028
MATT: Deception check.

5102
03:03:50.202 --> 03:03:51.619
TRAVIS: Don't fuck me, Gil.

5103
03:03:52.482 --> 03:03:54.309
You son of a bitch.

5104
03:03:54.309 --> 03:03:56.191
13, 14.

5105
03:03:56.191 --> 03:03:57.024
14.

5106
03:03:57.024 --> 03:03:57.857
MATT: Okay.

5107
03:03:59.202 --> 03:04:02.452
(low rasping)

5108
03:04:04.821 --> 03:04:07.488
TALIESIN: Did you complete your mission?

5109
03:04:09.791 --> 03:04:12.767
MATT: "Yes."

5110
03:04:12.767 --> 03:04:15.180
TALIESIN: Repeat your mission.

5111
03:04:15.180 --> 03:04:17.970
MATT: "Keep him

5112
03:04:17.970 --> 03:04:18.803
"safe."

5113
03:04:20.853 --> 03:04:23.591
TALIESIN: More specific, whom.

5114
03:04:23.591 --> 03:04:24.841
Prove yourself.

5115
03:04:25.943 --> 03:04:27.484
MATT: "Obann."

5116
03:04:28.702 --> 03:04:30.360
ALL: Obann?

5117
03:04:31.493 --> 03:04:32.410
SAM: 12 years.

5118
03:04:40.155 --> 03:04:40.988
TALIESIN: Where

5119
03:04:42.850 --> 03:04:45.517
Were you going to meet up north?

5120
03:04:46.759 --> 03:04:49.600
Specific location.

5121
03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:50.678
MATT: Make a deception check.

5122
03:04:50.678 --> 03:04:52.370
TALIESIN: All right.
LIAM: Come on, Caddy.

5123
03:04:52.370 --> 03:04:54.230
TALIESIN: Going for it.

5124
03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:55.063
20.

5125
03:04:55.063 --> 03:04:56.129
LIAM: Yes!

5126
03:04:56.129 --> 03:04:57.420
MATT: Natural 20?

5127
03:04:57.420 --> 03:04:58.645
TALIESIN: 17 plus--
MATT: Okay.

5128
03:04:58.645 --> 03:05:00.314
TALIESIN: Not a natural 20.

5129
03:05:00.314 --> 03:05:02.430
MATT: (rasping)

5130
03:05:06.965 --> 03:05:10.131
"The tomb

5131
03:05:10.131 --> 03:05:15.131
under Bazzoxan."

5132
03:05:15.562 --> 03:05:17.312
MARISHA: Tomb under Bazzoxan?

5133
03:05:21.904 --> 03:05:24.154
TALIESIN:: What is the name

5134
03:05:24.154 --> 03:05:25.821
of our organization?

5135
03:05:26.885 --> 03:05:29.019
Prove your identity.

5136
03:05:32.902 --> 03:05:36.064
MATT: "We follow...

5137
03:05:36.064 --> 03:05:41.064
"The Angel of Irons."

5138
03:05:41.184 --> 03:05:43.234
SAM and MARISHA: Angel of Irons?

5139
03:05:43.234 --> 03:05:44.401
TALIESIN: That's five.

5140
03:05:45.583 --> 03:05:47.213
LAURA: Oh shit.

5141
03:05:47.213 --> 03:05:50.143
That was so fucking sick, you guys!

5142
03:05:50.143 --> 03:05:51.852
TRAVIS: The Angel of Irons?
SAM: Yeah.

5143
03:05:51.852 --> 03:05:53.653
MARISHA: The Angel--

5144
03:05:53.653 --> 03:05:55.293
TRAVIS: Does that sound right, Matt, Angel of Irons?

5145
03:05:55.293 --> 03:05:57.987
LAURA: Caduceus, that was so good!

5146
03:05:57.987 --> 03:05:59.454
MARISHA: The name of their organization

5147
03:05:59.454 --> 03:06:01.503
is the Angel of Irons?

5148
03:06:01.503 --> 03:06:03.701
MATT: They follow the Angel of Irons.

5149
03:06:03.701 --> 03:06:06.165
SAM: (like Maruo) Caduceus, that was amazing!

5150
03:06:06.165 --> 03:06:08.415
(laughter)

5151
03:06:11.210 --> 03:06:12.458
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

5152
03:06:12.458 --> 03:06:17.048
TRAVIS: You add 90 more decibels before you're there.

5153
03:06:17.048 --> 03:06:18.197
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've never done that that way.

5154
03:06:18.197 --> 03:06:19.538
That was interesting.

5155
03:06:19.538 --> 03:06:21.626
LAURA: I mean, it worked really well.

5156
03:06:21.626 --> 03:06:22.888
He totally fell for it,

5157
03:06:22.888 --> 03:06:24.888
that head was so stupid!

5158
03:06:26.868 --> 03:06:28.251
TALIESIN: One more head.

5159
03:06:28.251 --> 03:06:30.473
SAM: We follow the Angel of Irons, right?

5160
03:06:30.473 --> 03:06:32.785
LAURA: Yeah, we follow the Angel of Irons.

5161
03:06:32.785 --> 03:06:34.095
TRAVIS: Fuck is that--

5162
03:06:34.095 --> 03:06:34.928
SAM: Who is that?

5163
03:06:34.928 --> 03:06:38.286
TRAVIS: Have any of us ever heard of an Angel of Irons?

5164
03:06:38.286 --> 03:06:40.286
MATT: Make a religion check.

5165
03:06:41.847 --> 03:06:42.897
MARISHA: Okay.

5166
03:06:42.897 --> 03:06:44.563
TRAVIS: Come on, nat20.
LAURA: 19.

5167
03:06:44.563 --> 03:06:46.515
SAM: Just people who are proficient in it?

5168
03:06:46.515 --> 03:06:48.787
MATT: Anyone who wants to make it, sure.

5169
03:06:48.787 --> 03:06:49.620
MARISHA: Yeah!

5170
03:06:50.487 --> 03:06:51.320
TRAVIS: 13.

5171
03:06:54.777 --> 03:06:57.628
MARISHA: Let me make sure, that's a 16, right, so--

5172
03:06:57.628 --> 03:06:58.809
TRAVIS: 22?
MARISHA: 22.

5173
03:06:58.809 --> 03:06:59.642
LIAM: 22.

5174
03:07:00.669 --> 03:07:01.634
SASM: 16.

5175
03:07:01.634 --> 03:07:02.579
LAURA: 19.

5176
03:07:02.579 --> 03:07:04.325
ASHLEY: Three!

5177
03:07:04.325 --> 03:07:05.242
MATT: Caduceus?

5178
03:07:06.674 --> 03:07:07.831
TALIESIN: 16.

5179
03:07:07.831 --> 03:07:08.780
MATT: None of you have heard of it.

5180
03:07:08.780 --> 03:07:11.280
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh! (sighs)

5181
03:07:12.364 --> 03:07:13.197
MARISHA: (whispers) Fuck!

5182
03:07:13.197 --> 03:07:16.455
TRAVIS: (Whispers) The Angel of Irons.

5183
03:07:16.455 --> 03:07:18.122
MARISHA: It was a religion check.

5184
03:07:21.290 --> 03:07:22.182
Okay.

5185
03:07:22.182 --> 03:07:24.791
SAM: Irons, irons.

5186
03:07:24.791 --> 03:07:26.389
LAURA: What is our other person?

5187
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:28.252
The dragonborn, okay.

5188
03:07:28.252 --> 03:07:31.423
MARISHA: Could see what she was delivering.

5189
03:07:31.423 --> 03:07:32.406
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5190
03:07:32.406 --> 03:07:34.042
MARISHA: It's like the answer we don't have yet.

5191
03:07:34.042 --> 03:07:36.852
LIAM: Does the name Obann mean anything to me?

5192
03:07:36.852 --> 03:07:39.582
MATT: Make a history check.

5193
03:07:41.139 --> 03:07:42.772
LIAM: Balls.

5194
03:07:42.772 --> 03:07:44.080
14.

5195
03:07:44.080 --> 03:07:44.913
MATT: Nope.

5196
03:07:44.913 --> 03:07:45.746
SAM: If this was--

5197
03:07:45.746 --> 03:07:48.071
so this is a drow,

5198
03:07:48.071 --> 03:07:50.882
the drow was among these people, right?

5199
03:07:50.882 --> 03:07:55.220
The drow in this area follow Luxon or,

5200
03:07:55.220 --> 03:07:57.911
wait, no, what's their religion?

5201
03:07:57.911 --> 03:07:59.632
MATT: The Dynasty follow the Luxon.

5202
03:07:59.632 --> 03:08:01.440
LAURA: But he's not part of the Dynasty.

5203
03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:02.511
SAM: No, I know!

5204
03:08:02.511 --> 03:08:05.852
There's a competing god in this--

5205
03:08:05.852 --> 03:08:07.160
TALIESIN: There's lots of competing gods in this.

5206
03:08:07.160 --> 03:08:09.202
LAURA: Maybe the Angel of Irons isn't a god,

5207
03:08:09.202 --> 03:08:11.619
maybe the Angel of Irons is--

5208
03:08:12.530 --> 03:08:13.363
TALIESIN: A lot of things.

5209
03:08:13.363 --> 03:08:14.196
LIAM: It could just be a bad dude.

5210
03:08:14.196 --> 03:08:16.978
It could also be a god, it could be a demigod.

5211
03:08:16.978 --> 03:08:18.317
SAM: Do we need to talk to the dragonborn?

5212
03:08:18.317 --> 03:08:20.338
TALIESIN: I'm going to talk to the dragonborn, too.

5213
03:08:20.338 --> 03:08:21.778
LAURA: Should you also look like

5214
03:08:21.778 --> 03:08:23.107
the blonde guy for this one?

5215
03:08:23.107 --> 03:08:25.668
TALIESIN: I don't think that would be necessary.

5216
03:08:25.668 --> 03:08:26.868
Not with this one.

5217
03:08:26.868 --> 03:08:27.946
LAURA: Okay.

5218
03:08:27.946 --> 03:08:29.468
TALIESIN: I'm going to be myself for this one.

5219
03:08:29.468 --> 03:08:30.301
MATT: Okay.

5220
03:08:30.301 --> 03:08:31.959
You dispel your disguise.

5221
03:08:31.959 --> 03:08:33.428
TRAVIS: You want me over your shoulder?

5222
03:08:33.428 --> 03:08:34.290
TALIESIN: No.

5223
03:08:34.290 --> 03:08:38.015
TRAVIS: I still look like the guy he was meeting.

5224
03:08:38.015 --> 03:08:40.848
MARISHA: That's, she did do the hand-off.

5225
03:08:42.392 --> 03:08:43.573
TRAVIS: Was it a female dragonborn?

5226
03:08:43.573 --> 03:08:45.164
LIAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry, yeah.

5227
03:08:47.007 --> 03:08:48.799
TALIESIN: Up to you, this is your call.

5228
03:08:48.799 --> 03:08:50.898
TRAVIS: I'll stand over your shoulder, it doesn't hurt.

5229
03:08:50.898 --> 03:08:53.847
I still look on fleek!

5230
03:08:53.847 --> 03:08:54.738
MATT: Okay.

5231
03:08:54.738 --> 03:08:57.428
You pull out the dragonborn head.

5232
03:08:57.428 --> 03:09:01.199
TALIESIN: One more time. (goopy sound)

5233
03:09:01.199 --> 03:09:04.148
(laughter)

5234
03:09:04.148 --> 03:09:05.508
TRAVIS: The fucking (goopy sound)

5235
03:09:05.508 --> 03:09:07.255
TALIESIN: They're not as gross as they could be.

5236
03:09:07.255 --> 03:09:08.347
That's all I'm going to say.

5237
03:09:08.347 --> 03:09:09.407
ASHLEY: It's like Deadwood.

5238
03:09:09.407 --> 03:09:11.657
(laughter)

5239
03:09:17.576 --> 03:09:19.447
TALIESIN: And go.

5240
03:09:19.447 --> 03:09:20.280
Ten minutes.

5241
03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:21.113
Get it going.

5242
03:09:21.113 --> 03:09:24.777
MATT: (raspy sound) It falls on its side.

5243
03:09:24.777 --> 03:09:26.715
Its jaw opens to try and draw breath.

5244
03:09:26.715 --> 03:09:28.223
TALIESIN: I'm going to put it back up properly.

5245
03:09:28.223 --> 03:09:29.056
There we are.

5246
03:09:30.321 --> 03:09:31.154
(sighs)

5247
03:09:31.154 --> 03:09:33.821
LAURA: This is so Santa Clarita Diet.

5248
03:09:38.559 --> 03:09:41.309
TALIESIN: What was your assignment today?

5249
03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:44.000
MATT: (gasps) The jaw opens

5250
03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:45.709
and the head falls to the side again,

5251
03:09:45.709 --> 03:09:47.821
because it opens the jaw, it has to.

5252
03:09:47.821 --> 03:09:50.149
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold it,

5253
03:09:50.149 --> 03:09:52.131
because this is going to, this is not civilized.

5254
03:09:52.131 --> 03:09:57.131
MATT: "The assignment you gave me."

5255
03:09:57.259 --> 03:09:58.349
SAM: Shit.

5256
03:09:58.349 --> 03:10:00.610
TRAVIS: What'd he say?
MARISHA: The assignment you gave me.

5257
03:10:00.610 --> 03:10:01.639
Shit.

5258
03:10:01.639 --> 03:10:03.541
TALIESIN: Repeat it to me, please.

5259
03:10:03.541 --> 03:10:06.088
What was the assignment, specifically?

5260
03:10:06.088 --> 03:10:08.171
MATT: Make a deception check.

5261
03:10:09.170 --> 03:10:10.878
TALIESIN: Come on.

5262
03:10:10.878 --> 03:10:12.936
13.

5263
03:10:14.061 --> 03:10:15.021
MATT: Well, you're not in the guy's form.

5264
03:10:15.021 --> 03:10:16.209
TALIESIN: I'm not in the guy, that's right,

5265
03:10:16.209 --> 03:10:17.642
which is why I was like--

5266
03:10:17.642 --> 03:10:18.728
because they don't know who I am.

5267
03:10:18.728 --> 03:10:19.753
MATT: I forgot about that.

5268
03:10:19.753 --> 03:10:21.100
So answer to the first question,

5269
03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:23.267
backtrack about that. Yeah.

5270
03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:28.600
"I was delivering...

5271
03:10:28.600 --> 03:10:31.617
"a crest..."

5272
03:10:32.581 --> 03:10:34.390
SAM: Our crest?

5273
03:10:34.390 --> 03:10:35.802
MARISHA: Our crest, is it?

5274
03:10:35.802 --> 03:10:36.635
ASHLEY: Delivering a crest?

5275
03:10:36.635 --> 03:10:37.468
TRAVIS: I think a crest.

5276
03:10:37.468 --> 03:10:38.301
TALIESIN: Our crest?

5277
03:10:38.301 --> 03:10:39.134
MATT: A crest.

5278
03:10:39.134 --> 03:10:40.467
TALIESIN: Oh. a crest.

5279
03:10:42.551 --> 03:10:44.301
TALIESIN: The Angel of Irons?

5280
03:10:47.453 --> 03:10:48.286
MATT: Is that a question?

5281
03:10:48.286 --> 03:10:49.953
TALIESIN: Yeah, which crest?

5282
03:10:51.112 --> 03:10:53.712
Whose crest, I suppose would be the better question.

5283
03:10:53.712 --> 03:10:57.045
MATT: "I don't know."

5284
03:10:59.320 --> 03:11:02.251
TALIESIN: Who is the Angel of Irons?

5285
03:11:02.251 --> 03:11:04.956
MATT: "I don't know."

5286
03:11:07.240 --> 03:11:08.853
SAM: Ask who his boss is.

5287
03:11:08.853 --> 03:11:10.827
LIAM: Who were the people you were meeting?

5288
03:11:10.827 --> 03:11:12.669
MARISHA: Yeah. Who you work for.

5289
03:11:12.669 --> 03:11:14.691
TALIESIN: Who do you work for?

5290
03:11:14.691 --> 03:11:16.559
Who do you serve?

5291
03:11:16.559 --> 03:11:19.272
MATT: "I serve no one,

5292
03:11:19.272 --> 03:11:23.659
"I work for those who pay me."

5293
03:11:23.659 --> 03:11:24.492
SAM: Damn it.

5294
03:11:28.224 --> 03:11:31.452
TALIESIN: Who was your last employer?

5295
03:11:31.452 --> 03:11:35.535
MATT: "I don't know his name."

5296
03:11:36.842 --> 03:11:38.017
SAM: I think that's it.

5297
03:11:38.017 --> 03:11:39.165
TALIESIN: I think that's all of them, actually.

5298
03:11:39.165 --> 03:11:40.265
MARISHA: Is that it?

5299
03:11:40.265 --> 03:11:41.784
LAURA: That's all we got.

5300
03:11:41.784 --> 03:11:43.254
SAM: A whole bunch of nothing.

5301
03:11:43.254 --> 03:11:44.817
TRAVIS: Tell me what you know...?

5302
03:11:44.817 --> 03:11:45.915
TALIESIN: Was that--

5303
03:11:45.915 --> 03:11:47.293
SAM: Our crest.

5304
03:11:47.293 --> 03:11:48.253
TALIESIN: I think that was five.

5305
03:11:48.253 --> 03:11:49.875
MATT: I feel like that may have been four, but.

5306
03:11:49.875 --> 03:11:53.125
TALIESIN: I'm feeling like it was five.

5307
03:11:54.673 --> 03:11:56.590
LAURA: I guess you can ask--

5308
03:11:57.914 --> 03:12:00.164
MARISHA: Any more details about...

5309
03:12:04.527 --> 03:12:06.327
TRAVIS: Where did you meet--

5310
03:12:06.327 --> 03:12:09.425
LAURA: Yeah, where did you meet him?

5311
03:12:09.425 --> 03:12:13.185
TALIESIN: Where did you meet your last employer?

5312
03:12:13.185 --> 03:12:15.716
MATT: "Talonstadt."

5313
03:12:15.716 --> 03:12:16.785
SAM: Stalin?

5314
03:12:16.785 --> 03:12:19.196
MATT: Talonstadt.

5315
03:12:19.196 --> 03:12:22.196
TALIESIN: I would definitely call that five.

5316
03:12:23.356 --> 03:12:24.814
LIAM: Do I know the place?

5317
03:12:24.814 --> 03:12:28.207
MATT: You do, it's in the Empire.

5318
03:12:28.207 --> 03:12:30.290
LAURA: Where's our Empire map?

5319
03:12:31.897 --> 03:12:34.743
We've been near there, haven't we?

5320
03:12:34.743 --> 03:12:37.236
MATT: Not really been near Talonstadt.

5321
03:12:37.236 --> 03:12:39.653
LIAM: But not part of my history.

5322
03:12:40.956 --> 03:12:41.935
LIAM: Yours, no.

5323
03:12:41.935 --> 03:12:43.602
TRAVIS: Talonstadt, over...

5324
03:12:44.455 --> 03:12:45.288
Right here.

5325
03:12:45.288 --> 03:12:46.626
LAURA: Okay, it's right on the other side of the--

5326
03:12:46.626 --> 03:12:48.898
MATT: Though both Beauregard and Caleb

5327
03:12:48.898 --> 03:12:53.226
can both make history checks, if you'd like.

5328
03:12:53.226 --> 03:12:54.485
SAM: I live right next to that.

5329
03:12:54.485 --> 03:12:56.018
TRAVIS: East of Felderwin.

5330
03:12:56.018 --> 03:12:57.768
MATT: Yeah, but you didn't travel much.

5331
03:12:57.768 --> 03:12:58.601
SAM: No, I didn't.

5332
03:12:58.601 --> 03:12:59.434
MATT: Actually, you can make a history check,

5333
03:12:59.434 --> 03:13:00.267
too, if you want.

5334
03:13:00.267 --> 03:13:01.978
LIAM: 21.
MARISHA: 12.

5335
03:13:01.978 --> 03:13:03.397
SAM: 12.

5336
03:13:03.397 --> 03:13:04.237
15.

5337
03:13:04.237 --> 03:13:05.338
MATT: 15, okay.

5338
03:13:05.338 --> 03:13:06.527
You guys pick up on it a bit.

5339
03:13:06.527 --> 03:13:08.777
Talonstadt is essentially a--

5340
03:13:10.485 --> 03:13:11.626
it's been a refugee tent city

5341
03:13:11.626 --> 03:13:14.174
for about 20 or so years

5342
03:13:14.174 --> 03:13:18.173
of a number of Ravenites that

5343
03:13:18.173 --> 03:13:20.838
fled from the destruction of Draconia.

5344
03:13:20.838 --> 03:13:22.975
and sought refuge in the Empire.

5345
03:13:22.975 --> 03:13:24.045
The Empire essentially

5346
03:13:24.045 --> 03:13:27.237
welcomed them in, but kept them in this area

5347
03:13:27.237 --> 03:13:29.982
as they were processed and

5348
03:13:29.982 --> 03:13:31.524
given a place to stay,

5349
03:13:31.524 --> 03:13:34.345
then eventually became a settlement known as Talonstadt.

5350
03:13:34.345 --> 03:13:35.964
Which is--

5351
03:13:35.964 --> 03:13:36.797
TALIESIN: It was temporary.

5352
03:13:36.797 --> 03:13:38.585
MATT: Yeah, it's temporary, but it's become more permanent,

5353
03:13:38.585 --> 03:13:40.273
which means it's not a very--

5354
03:13:40.273 --> 03:13:43.673
LIAM: Yeah, what is the Empire proper's feelings about them?

5355
03:13:43.673 --> 03:13:45.625
Are they just tolerated, are they--

5356
03:13:45.625 --> 03:13:48.894
MATT: No, they're not discriminated against per se,

5357
03:13:48.894 --> 03:13:51.044
there are some people that have different feelings,

5358
03:13:51.044 --> 03:13:52.713
you know, especially since what happened

5359
03:13:52.713 --> 03:13:55.488
with Draconia and previous

5360
03:13:56.425 --> 03:13:59.385
political relationships varied,

5361
03:13:59.385 --> 03:14:02.055
depending on the individual.

5362
03:14:02.055 --> 03:14:02.888
Yeah, with your roll,

5363
03:14:02.888 --> 03:14:04.524
especially you'd know that they were,

5364
03:14:04.524 --> 03:14:07.335
members of people who live in Talonstadt

5365
03:14:07.335 --> 03:14:09.085
that are specifically

5366
03:14:10.484 --> 03:14:13.651
worried that there have been surviving

5367
03:14:14.505 --> 03:14:17.585
Draconian nobles hiding within the political structure

5368
03:14:17.585 --> 03:14:19.433
of the Empire and feel like

5369
03:14:19.433 --> 03:14:21.055
they're probably working to

5370
03:14:21.055 --> 03:14:23.255
eliminate the Ravenites' existence within the Empire.

5371
03:14:23.255 --> 03:14:25.335
There's a lot of really,

5372
03:14:25.335 --> 03:14:27.233
really tense and complicated political dynamics

5373
03:14:27.233 --> 03:14:32.233
between Talonstadt, the Empire, and perceived allies

5374
03:14:32.345 --> 03:14:35.625
that remain from the fall of Draconia.

5375
03:14:35.625 --> 03:14:37.174
But yeah.

5376
03:14:37.174 --> 03:14:39.138
That's what that city is.

5377
03:14:39.138 --> 03:14:40.581
It's close to the border of Xhorhas,

5378
03:14:40.581 --> 03:14:43.922
it's right south of Bladegarden.

5379
03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:46.447
TALIESIN: I'm going to gather up the heads

5380
03:14:46.447 --> 03:14:49.535
and them put them back into the bag.

5381
03:14:49.535 --> 03:14:50.368
MATT: Mmkay.

5382
03:14:51.425 --> 03:14:56.345
LAURA: Who was it you wanted me to send messages to, again?

5383
03:14:56.345 --> 03:14:59.447
SAM: Well, should we message the Bright Queen

5384
03:14:59.447 --> 03:15:02.236
and just say: Mission is continuing,

5385
03:15:02.236 --> 03:15:03.736
almost to the end?

5386
03:15:05.127 --> 03:15:07.044
LAURA: Just as planned.

5387
03:15:07.044 --> 03:15:09.399
Following our guide.

5388
03:15:09.399 --> 03:15:11.015
LIAM: I think we should keep her in the dark

5389
03:15:11.015 --> 03:15:12.079
for the time being.

5390
03:15:12.079 --> 03:15:13.387
MARISHA: No news is good news.

5391
03:15:13.387 --> 03:15:14.220
LIAM: Yeah.

5392
03:15:14.220 --> 03:15:15.053
LAURA: Okay.

5393
03:15:15.053 --> 03:15:17.478
SAM: I mean, certainly she heard of the

5394
03:15:17.478 --> 03:15:20.839
action around her town today.

5395
03:15:20.839 --> 03:15:21.776
LIAM: That's muddy.

5396
03:15:21.776 --> 03:15:23.017
TRAVIS: Do you want to try and message

5397
03:15:23.017 --> 03:15:24.478
the one that we're chasing

5398
03:15:24.478 --> 03:15:26.596
and pretend to throw him off the trail

5399
03:15:26.596 --> 03:15:28.857
and if he is scrying on us,

5400
03:15:28.857 --> 03:15:31.007
or keeping tabs on us,

5401
03:15:31.007 --> 03:15:32.548
he'll let us know?

5402
03:15:32.548 --> 03:15:36.788
LIAM: Or check in with your family, Nott.

5403
03:15:36.788 --> 03:15:38.541
LAURA: I've got three Sendings.

5404
03:15:38.541 --> 03:15:40.097
I can send multiple things.

5405
03:15:40.097 --> 03:15:41.427
MARISHA: You can also check in with Maruo.

5406
03:15:41.427 --> 03:15:43.004
See if anyone else showed up.

5407
03:15:43.004 --> 03:15:43.837
TRAVIS: Yep.

5408
03:15:43.837 --> 03:15:45.148
LAURA: That's a good one, let's start there.

5409
03:15:45.148 --> 03:15:46.207
TRAVIS: Maruo.

5410
03:15:46.207 --> 03:15:47.786
LAURA: I'm going to start with Maruo.

5411
03:15:47.786 --> 03:15:49.087
MATT: Okay.

5412
03:15:49.087 --> 03:15:51.919
LAURA: Hey Maruo, any other people show up there?

5413
03:15:51.919 --> 03:15:53.752
This is the blue girl!

5414
03:15:57.788 --> 03:15:59.897
Remember, we'll kill you if you're lying!

5415
03:15:59.897 --> 03:16:02.147
(laughter)

5416
03:16:03.489 --> 03:16:04.975
TRAVIS: You've got plenty more.

5417
03:16:04.975 --> 03:16:06.967
LAURA: Also you're super cute.

5418
03:16:06.967 --> 03:16:08.407
Thanks for the hair stuff.

5419
03:16:08.407 --> 03:16:10.657
(laughter)

5420
03:16:11.586 --> 03:16:15.117
MATT: "It's a little weird, um.

5421
03:16:15.117 --> 03:16:16.367
"Yeah, I'm fine.

5422
03:16:17.557 --> 03:16:20.264
"Nobody else really showed up.

5423
03:16:20.264 --> 03:16:22.367
"Couple customers.

5424
03:16:22.367 --> 03:16:23.367
"Just buying

5425
03:16:24.864 --> 03:16:25.697
"the usual.

5426
03:16:27.746 --> 03:16:28.735
"Don't kill me!"

5427
03:16:28.735 --> 03:16:31.415
(laughter)

5428
03:16:31.415 --> 03:16:32.935
LAURA: Maruo's fine, everything's fine,

5429
03:16:32.935 --> 03:16:33.927
everything's good.

5430
03:16:33.927 --> 03:16:36.094
Who else should I talk to?

5431
03:16:37.626 --> 03:16:39.265
SAM: I would love to check in,

5432
03:16:39.265 --> 03:16:41.477
just tell Yeza we're still okay,

5433
03:16:41.477 --> 03:16:43.685
but you know, I don't want to waste a spell

5434
03:16:43.685 --> 03:16:44.806
if we have other folks that we need--

5435
03:16:44.806 --> 03:16:46.985
LAURA: Heyo, Yeza!

5436
03:16:46.985 --> 03:16:48.914
TRAVIS: Is that one word, let's call it two.

5437
03:16:48.914 --> 03:16:50.095
(laughter)

5438
03:16:50.095 --> 03:16:51.506
MARISHA: Heyo, Yeza.

5439
03:16:51.506 --> 03:16:53.095
MATT: That's two, we'll go with two.

5440
03:16:53.095 --> 03:16:56.666
LAURA: So we're all safe, don't worry about us.

5441
03:16:56.666 --> 03:16:58.975
We fought these guys with five arms,

5442
03:16:58.975 --> 03:17:01.317
woof, we almost died.

5443
03:17:01.317 --> 03:17:02.818
But now we're good, we're good.

5444
03:17:02.818 --> 03:17:04.125
Also--

5445
03:17:04.125 --> 03:17:06.137
(laughter)

5446
03:17:06.137 --> 03:17:07.727
MATT: "Oh, okay!

5447
03:17:07.727 --> 03:17:12.011
"I'm glad to hear you're good.

5448
03:17:15.252 --> 03:17:19.277
"I'll probably clean up a little bit.

5449
03:17:19.277 --> 03:17:22.786
TRAVIS: That's actually been, "No, we're good, we're--"

5450
03:17:22.786 --> 03:17:23.997
(laughter)

5451
03:17:23.997 --> 03:17:24.967
MATT: "It's cold."

5452
03:17:24.967 --> 03:17:25.800
LAURA: Aww!

5453
03:17:26.957 --> 03:17:27.935
You should have brought him a coat

5454
03:17:27.935 --> 03:17:30.317
or something before we left.

5455
03:17:30.317 --> 03:17:31.397
SAM: There's a hot tub!

5456
03:17:31.397 --> 03:17:33.498
(laughter)

5457
03:17:33.498 --> 03:17:35.359
LAURA: But he has to boil the water himself!

5458
03:17:35.359 --> 03:17:37.130
SAM: That's true.

5459
03:17:37.130 --> 03:17:38.378
MATT: "Tell Veth I love her."

5460
03:17:38.378 --> 03:17:39.429
LAURA: Aww!

5461
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:40.279
MATT: He had enough words after that.

5462
03:17:40.279 --> 03:17:42.938
LAURA: He loves you so much!

5463
03:17:42.938 --> 03:17:43.938
Last person?

5464
03:17:47.418 --> 03:17:52.197
LIAM: I've been thinking a lot about your child,

5465
03:17:52.197 --> 03:17:53.738
and your mother's house

5466
03:17:53.738 --> 03:17:56.342
and I'm not sure that your mother's house is

5467
03:17:56.342 --> 03:17:58.704
the best place to send your child

5468
03:17:58.704 --> 03:18:00.370
after all, perhaps.
LAURA: What? Why?

5469
03:18:00.370 --> 03:18:03.026
LIAM: Well, what if the letter that you two sent

5470
03:18:03.026 --> 03:18:06.367
has brought attention there?

5471
03:18:08.415 --> 03:18:10.515
LAURA: Here's the thing, Caleb.

5472
03:18:10.515 --> 03:18:13.885
You know, most people don't know my mom's last name.

5473
03:18:13.885 --> 03:18:16.236
You know, she's the Ruby of the Sea.

5474
03:18:16.236 --> 03:18:18.087
They'd have to really do some research

5475
03:18:18.087 --> 03:18:20.574
and I don't know how smart the people are,

5476
03:18:20.574 --> 03:18:22.258
that are in your organization,

5477
03:18:22.258 --> 03:18:27.175
but they probably wouldn't be able to figure it out, right?

5478
03:18:28.317 --> 03:18:31.058
LIAM: My point still stands.

5479
03:18:31.058 --> 03:18:33.807
LAURA: Okay, what if I send the message to

5480
03:18:33.807 --> 03:18:36.307
the owner of the Pillow Trove.

5481
03:18:37.816 --> 03:18:40.967
SAM: And say what?

5482
03:18:40.967 --> 03:18:43.629
Accidentally might have alerted

5483
03:18:43.629 --> 03:18:46.129
the worst people in the world?

5484
03:18:46.989 --> 03:18:47.822
LAURA: Hey.

5485
03:18:47.822 --> 03:18:48.905
SAM: Be careful?

5486
03:18:50.658 --> 03:18:52.825
LAURA: If the person that, hmm.

5487
03:18:54.028 --> 03:18:55.137
LIAM: I think for now, you know,

5488
03:18:55.137 --> 03:18:57.177
your mother is probably all right

5489
03:18:57.177 --> 03:18:59.399
if there, maybe nothing is happening,

5490
03:18:59.399 --> 03:19:02.479
but if they have been alerted to her,

5491
03:19:02.479 --> 03:19:04.109
maybe they are watching.

5492
03:19:04.109 --> 03:19:06.458
If the child shows up, I,

5493
03:19:06.458 --> 03:19:08.749
it seems like an unnecessary risk.

5494
03:19:08.749 --> 03:19:11.312
LAURA: But there's nowhere else in Nicodranas for

5495
03:19:11.312 --> 03:19:13.235
him to go, it's really safe.

5496
03:19:13.235 --> 03:19:16.226
Then at least my mom can find somewhere else to go.

5497
03:19:16.226 --> 03:19:18.615
SAM: Does your mom have safe houses or anything--

5498
03:19:18.615 --> 03:19:20.415
LAURA: Of course she does, she knows a lot of people.

5499
03:19:20.415 --> 03:19:22.127
SAM: Should she go there now?

5500
03:19:22.127 --> 03:19:22.960
LAURA: Oh.

5501
03:19:24.818 --> 03:19:27.807
Well, that would be kind of hard

5502
03:19:27.807 --> 03:19:28.640
to...

5503
03:19:29.589 --> 03:19:32.029
SAM: She'd just be going to the safe house for no reason.

5504
03:19:32.029 --> 03:19:36.788
LAURA: Well, it's just, she doesn't like to, you know.

5505
03:19:36.788 --> 03:19:37.621
Leave.

5506
03:19:38.957 --> 03:19:43.361
It would be hard for her to go to this--

5507
03:19:43.361 --> 03:19:45.147
SAM: She doesn't like to leave her house?

5508
03:19:45.147 --> 03:19:46.480
Because of work?

5509
03:19:49.298 --> 03:19:50.207
LAURA: Yes.

5510
03:19:50.207 --> 03:19:51.087
No.

5511
03:19:51.087 --> 03:19:53.898
She just doesn't feel comfortable, you know?

5512
03:19:53.898 --> 03:19:57.565
SAM: Is she scared of the outside or something?

5513
03:19:58.607 --> 03:20:02.927
LAURA: Well, a little, that's the impression I got.

5514
03:20:02.927 --> 03:20:04.637
Makes her anxious, you know?

5515
03:20:04.637 --> 03:20:05.470
SAM: Oh.

5516
03:20:06.847 --> 03:20:10.163
LAURA: She feels safe in the Chateau.

5517
03:20:11.492 --> 03:20:13.645
MARISHA: Maybe it's worth using that last message spell

5518
03:20:13.645 --> 03:20:15.685
to just check in with her?

5519
03:20:15.685 --> 03:20:16.983
LAURA: Make sure she's okay?

5520
03:20:16.983 --> 03:20:17.954
MARISHA: Yeah.

5521
03:20:17.954 --> 03:20:21.634
See if any ruffians or weirdos have been hanging out.

5522
03:20:21.634 --> 03:20:23.973
Different clientele than the usual.

5523
03:20:23.973 --> 03:20:26.390
LAURA: What does Astrid look like?

5524
03:20:28.858 --> 03:20:32.653
LIAM: Ah, well, she's, she was,

5525
03:20:32.653 --> 03:20:34.783
on the short side.

5526
03:20:34.783 --> 03:20:36.653
MARISHA: Probably still short.

5527
03:20:36.653 --> 03:20:38.285
LIAM: About your height.

5528
03:20:38.285 --> 03:20:39.943
LAURA: I'm not short!

5529
03:20:39.943 --> 03:20:41.526
LIAM: How tall are you?

5530
03:20:42.459 --> 03:20:44.375
LAURA: Five-three.

5531
03:20:44.375 --> 03:20:45.312
LIAM: About there.

5532
03:20:45.312 --> 03:20:46.826
LAURA: Okay.

5533
03:20:46.826 --> 03:20:50.845
LIAM: When I knew her, she had very short hair.

5534
03:20:50.845 --> 03:20:54.434
It was dark brown.

5535
03:20:54.434 --> 03:20:55.735
LAURA: Dark brown, okay.

5536
03:20:55.735 --> 03:20:57.194
LIAM: This was a long time ago.

5537
03:20:57.194 --> 03:20:59.274
LAURA: What color were her eyes?

5538
03:20:59.274 --> 03:21:00.282
LIAM: They were brown.

5539
03:21:00.282 --> 03:21:01.415
LAURA: Brown, all right.

5540
03:21:01.415 --> 03:21:03.994
MARISHA: Probably still brown, too.

5541
03:21:03.994 --> 03:21:04.827
Nothing.

5542
03:21:05.840 --> 03:21:10.143
LAURA: Did she have any scars or any, you know,

5543
03:21:10.143 --> 03:21:13.060
features that were super prominent?

5544
03:21:15.175 --> 03:21:17.114
Scars on her arms, okay.

5545
03:21:17.114 --> 03:21:18.447
Just like yours.

5546
03:21:19.352 --> 03:21:20.485
Okay.

5547
03:21:20.485 --> 03:21:22.873
LIAM: I could be worried about nothing,

5548
03:21:22.873 --> 03:21:26.965
but if your mother has been compromised in some way,

5549
03:21:26.965 --> 03:21:31.465
it is too late, but it is not too late for your child, Nott.

5550
03:21:33.495 --> 03:21:35.495
It seems like a bad idea

5551
03:21:36.613 --> 03:21:38.213
to send him there.

5552
03:21:38.213 --> 03:21:39.046
To me.

5553
03:21:40.103 --> 03:21:41.514
SAM: I--

5554
03:21:41.514 --> 03:21:43.474
LIAM: It pains me to say that even, but--

5555
03:21:43.474 --> 03:21:45.224
SAM: I trust you.

5556
03:21:47.063 --> 03:21:47.896
LAURA: Maybe you could say--

5557
03:21:47.896 --> 03:21:51.445
SAM: Shäkaste isn't going to even be there for some time.

5558
03:21:51.445 --> 03:21:52.278
LAURA: That's true.

5559
03:21:52.278 --> 03:21:53.543
SAM: It would take more weeks

5560
03:21:53.543 --> 03:21:55.901
for them to travel, but you're right.

5561
03:21:55.901 --> 03:21:57.583
Maybe we should call that off

5562
03:21:57.583 --> 03:21:59.533
or just tell Shäkaste to hold

5563
03:21:59.533 --> 03:22:02.008
until we know more.

5564
03:22:04.095 --> 03:22:07.428
LAURA: Maybe he can go to the wizard's tower?

5565
03:22:11.569 --> 03:22:14.923
SAM: I don't know, I don't know what the wizard feels

5566
03:22:14.923 --> 03:22:16.384
about this right now.

5567
03:22:16.384 --> 03:22:17.803
LIAM: I don't know, I would like to maybe

5568
03:22:17.803 --> 03:22:20.294
bring your child to

5569
03:22:21.794 --> 03:22:23.344
Rosohna.

5570
03:22:23.344 --> 03:22:24.344
MARISHA: Well, let's

5571
03:22:26.332 --> 03:22:27.165
check in.

5572
03:22:28.641 --> 03:22:29.677
We're making a lot of assumptions

5573
03:22:29.677 --> 03:22:31.872
on information we don't fully know yet.

5574
03:22:31.872 --> 03:22:32.705
LIAM: Sure.

5575
03:22:34.283 --> 03:22:37.783
MARISHA: I mean, it's a very us thing to do, but.

5576
03:22:39.763 --> 03:22:41.802
LAURA: I send a message to my mom.

5577
03:22:41.802 --> 03:22:42.635
MATT: Okay.

5578
03:22:48.763 --> 03:22:49.596
LAURA: Hi,

5579
03:22:51.313 --> 03:22:53.029
little worried.

5580
03:22:54.515 --> 03:22:56.265
Someone may be coming

5581
03:22:58.243 --> 03:23:00.260
to the Chateau.

5582
03:23:01.835 --> 03:23:03.252
If you see a girl

5583
03:23:06.448 --> 03:23:10.432
five-three, brown hair and eyes.

5584
03:23:11.992 --> 03:23:13.576
Short hair.

5585
03:23:17.532 --> 03:23:18.365
Scars on her arms.

5586
03:23:20.440 --> 03:23:21.273
SAM: Boom.

5587
03:23:23.763 --> 03:23:26.293
LAURA: Shit. (laughs)

5588
03:23:26.293 --> 03:23:27.126
MATT: "Jester.

5589
03:23:28.221 --> 03:23:29.054
"Ah.

5590
03:23:30.352 --> 03:23:31.352
"I'm worried.

5591
03:23:33.169 --> 03:23:35.502
"From the tone of your voice.

5592
03:23:37.368 --> 03:23:40.125
"I will keep a look out

5593
03:23:40.125 --> 03:23:42.583
"and hope everything is okay.

5594
03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:46.679
"Come back soon.

5595
03:23:48.420 --> 03:23:49.410
"I miss you."

5596
03:23:49.410 --> 03:23:51.391
LAURA: (whimpering)

5597
03:23:51.391 --> 03:23:52.969
MATT: That's all.

5598
03:23:52.969 --> 03:23:54.930
LAURA: She misses me!

5599
03:23:54.930 --> 03:23:58.498
I don't have any more 3rd-level spells.

5600
03:23:58.498 --> 03:24:00.748
LIAM: If you talk to her again,

5601
03:24:02.046 --> 03:24:04.031
I mean, they could send anyone, I suppose,

5602
03:24:04.031 --> 03:24:06.700
but the other boy that I was with,

5603
03:24:06.700 --> 03:24:08.311
Eodwulf was his name.

5604
03:24:08.311 --> 03:24:10.027
He was large.

5605
03:24:10.977 --> 03:24:14.668
His hair was cropped very closely

5606
03:24:14.668 --> 03:24:16.490
like mine was, but, I mean,

5607
03:24:16.490 --> 03:24:18.930
my hair is long now, so that probably means nothing,

5608
03:24:18.930 --> 03:24:20.517
his hair was black.

5609
03:24:20.517 --> 03:24:22.549
His eyes were blue.

5610
03:24:22.549 --> 03:24:25.965
He was muscular.

5611
03:24:27.020 --> 03:24:28.187
He was strong.

5612
03:24:29.368 --> 03:24:32.540
In addition to being talented.

5613
03:24:32.540 --> 03:24:34.551
For the future.

5614
03:24:34.551 --> 03:24:35.884
ASHLEY: Talented at...

5615
03:24:37.919 --> 03:24:39.490
LIAM: The arcane.

5616
03:24:39.490 --> 03:24:40.323
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

5617
03:24:41.250 --> 03:24:44.510
MARISHA: So he was buff, and he can cast spells?

5618
03:24:44.510 --> 03:24:45.759
Well, that's not fair.

5619
03:24:45.759 --> 03:24:48.009
(laughter)

5620
03:24:50.370 --> 03:24:53.540
Multi-classing piece of shit.

5621
03:24:53.540 --> 03:24:54.850
I don't know, I'm just joking.

5622
03:24:54.850 --> 03:24:56.879
MATT: Or he just lifts.

5623
03:24:56.879 --> 03:24:59.679
(laughter)

5624
03:24:59.679 --> 03:25:02.591
TALIESIN: You can lift and read a book.

5625
03:25:02.591 --> 03:25:04.386
MARISHA: Lifting books.

5626
03:25:04.386 --> 03:25:05.219
LIAM: Is that true?

5627
03:25:05.219 --> 03:25:06.302
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

5628
03:25:07.996 --> 03:25:10.413
LAURA: I'll let my mama know that

5629
03:25:11.588 --> 03:25:14.306
next time I talk to her.

5630
03:25:14.306 --> 03:25:15.973
LIAM: I'm sorry, Jester.

5631
03:25:20.948 --> 03:25:21.996
SAM: Shall we turn in?

5632
03:25:21.996 --> 03:25:23.727
TRAVIS: I believe so.

5633
03:25:23.727 --> 03:25:24.915
TALIESIN: Just to make life a little easier,

5634
03:25:24.915 --> 03:25:27.047
I'll spend our last ten minutes before we go to sleep

5635
03:25:27.047 --> 03:25:29.774
casting a Prayer of Healing for anybody

5636
03:25:29.774 --> 03:25:31.405
who needs a little bit of HP

5637
03:25:31.405 --> 03:25:33.926
even before they restore their own stuff, so.

5638
03:25:33.926 --> 03:25:36.205
TRAVIS: I would not turn it down.

5639
03:25:36.205 --> 03:25:38.156
TALIESIN: Oh, that's pretty good.

5640
03:25:38.156 --> 03:25:38.989
12.

5641
03:25:40.704 --> 03:25:41.894
18.

5642
03:25:41.894 --> 03:25:45.564
23 hit points to anybody who wants it.

5643
03:25:45.564 --> 03:25:46.397
MATT: Mmkay.

5644
03:25:47.556 --> 03:25:48.985
You guys all

5645
03:25:48.985 --> 03:25:50.785
did the same setup as the night before.

5646
03:25:50.785 --> 03:25:52.406
Resting in the dome.

5647
03:25:52.406 --> 03:25:53.254
LIAM: Yeah.

5648
03:25:53.254 --> 03:25:55.686
Frumpkin will wake me if he sees anything.

5649
03:25:55.686 --> 03:25:56.556
MATT: Okay.

5650
03:25:56.556 --> 03:25:59.894
Roll a perception check for Frumpkin.

5651
03:25:59.894 --> 03:26:02.033
LIAM: My buzzard.

5652
03:26:02.033 --> 03:26:02.894
Natural one.

5653
03:26:02.894 --> 03:26:05.144
(laughter)

5654
03:26:06.666 --> 03:26:07.499
MATT: Okay.

5655
03:26:07.499 --> 03:26:08.438
ASHLEY: We're safe.

5656
03:26:08.438 --> 03:26:10.638
SAM: We're fine, we're fine!

5657
03:26:10.638 --> 03:26:12.566
TRAVIS: No light gets out, it's just dark.

5658
03:26:12.566 --> 03:26:14.655
LAURA: I have trouble sleeping tonight.

5659
03:26:14.655 --> 03:26:15.736
MATT: Okay.

5660
03:26:15.736 --> 03:26:17.227
TALIESIN: Don't we all.

5661
03:26:17.227 --> 03:26:18.557
MATT: So.

5662
03:26:18.557 --> 03:26:20.140
The night draws on.

5663
03:26:20.997 --> 03:26:22.947
It's somewhat restful,

5664
03:26:22.947 --> 03:26:24.947
sleep finds most of you.

5665
03:26:26.118 --> 03:26:27.886
The morning comes back.

5666
03:26:27.886 --> 03:26:29.053
The sun rises.

5667
03:26:30.176 --> 03:26:33.216
The sky, clouded as it was the day before,

5668
03:26:33.216 --> 03:26:34.715
not quite as broken,

5669
03:26:34.715 --> 03:26:37.615
with no sunlight peeking through this day.

5670
03:26:37.615 --> 03:26:40.698
A duller morning greets you.

5671
03:26:42.608 --> 03:26:44.368
You gather your things.

5672
03:26:44.368 --> 03:26:45.318
Sit atop your moorbounders

5673
03:26:45.318 --> 03:26:48.235
and continue on for your third day

5674
03:26:50.837 --> 03:26:52.117
outside of Rosohna.

5675
03:26:52.117 --> 03:26:54.033
TRAVIS: The final day?

5676
03:26:54.033 --> 03:26:54.874
MATT: Well.

5677
03:26:54.874 --> 03:26:55.707
TRAVIS: Maybe.

5678
03:26:55.707 --> 03:27:00.670
MATT: Well, no, it's three full days of rapid-pace travel

5679
03:27:00.670 --> 03:27:02.876
to get there. There was a little bit

5680
03:27:02.876 --> 03:27:04.177
of slowing at certain points

5681
03:27:04.177 --> 03:27:07.390
and you took a break right as you reached the edge,

5682
03:27:07.390 --> 03:27:09.208
so you have about three and a half days of travel,

5683
03:27:09.208 --> 03:27:11.718
so you still have a little bit more to go.

5684
03:27:11.718 --> 03:27:12.608
But.

5685
03:27:12.608 --> 03:27:13.441
We'll pick up there next--

5686
03:27:13.441 --> 03:27:15.150
LIAM: Damn it!
SAM: Aww.

5687
03:27:15.150 --> 03:27:16.483
ASHLEY: I want to keep playing!

5688
03:27:16.483 --> 03:27:17.324
MARISHA: I know.

5689
03:27:17.324 --> 03:27:19.257
LIAM: We'll just go one more day.

5690
03:27:19.257 --> 03:27:20.098
MARISHA: One more day.
LIAM: Just one more day.

5691
03:27:20.098 --> 03:27:21.431
MATT: It's 10:30. If you guys want to go to 11:00,

5692
03:27:21.431 --> 03:27:22.264
we can keep going.

5693
03:27:22.264 --> 03:27:23.598
LIAM: Oh, he's not going to call it.

5694
03:27:23.598 --> 03:27:25.078
MATT: It's up to you guys.

5695
03:27:25.078 --> 03:27:27.859
TALIESIN: I want to read some stuff.

5696
03:27:27.859 --> 03:27:30.000
I want to read some stuff before I go, so.

5697
03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:31.053
MATT: Okay.

5698
03:27:31.053 --> 03:27:33.387
LAURA: I gots to get home and pump.

5699
03:27:33.387 --> 03:27:36.756
TRAVIS: You up. Pump you up!

5700
03:27:36.756 --> 03:27:37.895
MATT: All right.

5701
03:27:37.895 --> 03:27:38.728
All right then,

5702
03:27:38.728 --> 03:27:41.013
we'll pick up this next Thursday.

5703
03:27:41.013 --> 03:27:43.321
Further into the Barbed Fields

5704
03:27:43.321 --> 03:27:44.526
of Xhorhas.

5705
03:27:44.526 --> 03:27:46.619
LIAM and ASHLEY: One more hour!

5706
03:27:46.619 --> 03:27:48.677
(laughter)

5707
03:27:48.677 --> 03:27:50.141
ASHLEY: Like old times, yeah, eight hour games!

5708
03:27:50.141 --> 03:27:51.249
TRAVIS: We can Postmates some mimosas,

5709
03:27:51.249 --> 03:27:52.955
this is not a problem!

5710
03:27:52.955 --> 03:27:54.596
Get some scones up in this bitch.

5711
03:27:54.596 --> 03:27:55.846
MARISHA: Some lox!

5712
03:27:55.846 --> 03:27:56.867
TRAVIS: Yeah!

5713
03:27:56.867 --> 03:27:58.795
LIAM: Can we Amazon Prime in a pump machine?

5714
03:27:58.795 --> 03:28:01.543
(laughter)

5715
03:28:01.543 --> 03:28:02.376
MARISHA: Send it on a drone!

5716
03:28:02.376 --> 03:28:03.406
(imitating drone motor)

5717
03:28:03.406 --> 03:28:04.989
TRAVIS: I know, it'd be so good.

5718
03:28:04.989 --> 03:28:05.998
MATT: I know.

5719
03:28:05.998 --> 03:28:07.305
All right, well.

5720
03:28:07.305 --> 03:28:08.768
We'll pick this up next week.

5721
03:28:08.768 --> 03:28:10.066
In the meantime, guys.

5722
03:28:10.066 --> 03:28:11.187
Have a wonderful week,

5723
03:28:11.187 --> 03:28:12.345
we'll see you soon.

5724
03:28:12.345 --> 03:28:13.876
We love you very much and--

5725
03:28:13.876 --> 03:28:14.709
MARISHA: Happy Red Nose Day.

5726
03:28:14.709 --> 03:28:16.147
MATT: Happy Red Nose Day.

5727
03:28:16.147 --> 03:28:18.048
MARISHA: We broke $100,000.

5728
03:28:18.048 --> 03:28:19.021
MATT: No shit, really?
MARISHA: Yeah.

5729
03:28:19.021 --> 03:28:20.567
TALIESIN: You're fucking kidding.

5730
03:28:20.567 --> 03:28:22.637
LAURA: Oh my god!

5731
03:28:22.637 --> 03:28:23.595
What!

5732
03:28:23.595 --> 03:28:24.816
MARISHA: The Critters are insane.

5733
03:28:24.816 --> 03:28:27.066
MATT: You guys are nuts.

5734
03:28:27.907 --> 03:28:29.736
MARISHA: Take that, child poverty.

5735
03:28:29.736 --> 03:28:31.192
MATT: Yeah. That's so cool,

5736
03:28:31.192 --> 03:28:33.143
you guys are amazing.
MARISHA: Fuck you.

5737
03:28:33.143 --> 03:28:34.292
TALIESIN: There's no problem you can't solve

5738
03:28:34.292 --> 03:28:35.575
with your fists.

5739
03:28:37.048 --> 03:28:39.215
MATT: I guess: is it Thursday yet?

5740
03:28:40.051 --> 03:28:40.968
Good night.

5741
03:28:42.264 --> 03:28:45.014
[dramatic music]

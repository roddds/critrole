00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.036
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:06.332
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:07.681
LAURA: Oh God!

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.012
TRAVIS: We're all a bunch of assholes!

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:11.879
LAURA: That might be the worst one!

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:12.862
TALIESIN: Oh man.

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:19.744
MATT: So welcome, Travis and all of you guys.
Before we jump into tonight's game, let's get

00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:23.691
through some announcements real fast, so hang
tight with us for a moment. First and foremost

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:28.497
tonight, our fantastic returning sponsor for this
campaign beginning and the foreseeable future,

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:31.574
until they decide to vanish in a puff of smoke: It
is D&amp;D Beyond!

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:33.069
(cheering)

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:35.136
MATT: Happy to have you guys! Sam, do you have a
few words one that?

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:39.071
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond has a mobile app, guys, and it is
out on beta! You can download it now at the App

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:43.486
Store and the Google Play Store-- The Apple App
Store and the Google Play Store. And because

00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:50.770
most-- well not most, but a lot of our audience is
located in the United Kingdom, I tailored

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.478
tonight's D&amp;D Beyond pitch to the British
audience.

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:57.433
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:03.311
SAM: Oi, mates! Have a butcher's and be gobbed by
this brand new D&amp;D Beyond mobile app for your dog

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.176
'n' bone!

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:05.967
LIAM: Sorry, Kit.

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:11.898
SAM: I know my onions on this and I ain't all
mouth and no trousers! It's a real corker of an

00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:18.255
app, and you can nick yours on the Apple App Store
and blimey, the bloody Google Play Store, too! Are

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:24.204
you skint? Tosh! It's free, and that's the dog's
bollocks! You don't got to be minted to get

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:29.727
sorted. There's nothing bent as a nine bob note
about it. You get an ereader with the beta, and

00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:33.000
character sheets will be added in the future
tickety-boo!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.119
LAURA: Wow!

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.482
SAM: That's a real phrase that I looked up.

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:38.039
MATT: Of course it is.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.060
SAM: So don't faff a dozy fortnight. You'll be
right gutted if you do! Oh, sweet fanny adams;

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.443
don't wag off! Search D&amp;D Beyond at your app store
and you'll be jolly good chuffed about it! Oh now

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:55.748
I'm knackered and cream crackered so I'm off to
Bedfordshire! Pip pip!

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:56.877
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:01:56.877 --> 00:01:58.901
MATT: Oh wow!

00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:01.976
TRAVIS: I feel like that was Masterpiece Theatre
all at once.

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:04.513
LIAM: I refuse to applaud that. I refuse.

00:02:04.513 --> 00:02:07.417
LAURA: I feel like that would be real hard to do
quickly, so I'm impressed!

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:15.067
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and we're sorry. Also, as a
quick note for you guys, they've begun posting

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:20.721
article content on DnDBeyond.com, which has been
awesome. We've done video content before. Now

00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:25.076
they're doing article content as well, editorial,
which our very own James Haeck, who you may know

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:29.253
helped me with the Tal'Dorei campaign guide, a
fantastic writer and a good friend of the show, is

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:33.930
doing stuff there now. He's officially on board
with D&amp;D Beyond, and he's doing the campaign two

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.510
summaries right now for the Critical Role
campaign. Those episode recaps will be posted

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.365
every Friday! Check them out! So awesome
congratulations to you, James, and if you haven't

to mess up his name every week because apparently

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:22.146
I really-- Anyways, he hosts our fantastic Talks
Machina wrap-up show about today's episode next

whatever cast members show up to dish the dirt and
shoot the shit and whatever else involves doing

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:40.581
something and something. You got it. Daylight
Savings Time hits the US on Sunday.

00:03:40.581 --> 00:03:41.937
TALIESIN: That's not true, is it?

00:03:41.937 --> 00:03:42.933
SAM: I didn't know that!

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:43.826
TALIESIN: Why would they do that?

00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:45.352
MATT: Well, it's on the list if it's not. I don't
know anymore.

00:03:45.352 --> 00:03:46.890
TRAVIS: We spring forward.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.620
LAURA: So we lose an hour.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.259
MARISHA: So we lose an hour of sleep.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:56.085
MATT: So check out WhenIsCriticalRole.com for an
update on when Talks Machina and Critical Role

00:03:56.085 --> 00:04:00.784
will be live in your timezone if you aren't lucky
enough to be living in the Dark Ages like America

00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:03.320
is when it comes to keeping track of your time.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.144
LIAM: Also, if you're watching this episode in
July of 2019, you're welcome.

00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:13.963
MATT: The podcast episode of last week's episode
of Critical Role is available now for all your

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:20.566
fine downloadable podcast purposes. And there's no
giveaways tonight from Wyrmwood, but

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:24.470
congratulations to our friends at Wyrmwood on the
success of their Adventurer's Arsenal Kickstarter

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.305
and to all of the guys who supported it. It looks
really awesome and to all the critters who

00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:33.613
supported it, thank you so much and we'll
hopefully be back to giving something next week.

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:39.950
We have a couple other cool announcements. One,
issue five of Vox Machina: Origins is out if you

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.312
haven't seen it yet.

00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:42.642
MARISHA: Oh man!

00:04:42.642 --> 00:04:44.931
TRAVIS: Beat to shit Vax on the front! It's
fucking awesome!

00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:46.489
MATT: It's pretty great!

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:48.492
SAM: I still haven't read it! I need to!

00:04:48.492 --> 00:04:53.666
MATT: Sam! It's really good. We've already gotten
back a good portion of the art for issue six, the

00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:57.156
end of this arc, and it looks really good. If you
haven't had a chance, you can check it out. You

00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:02.114
can download it on ComiXology, on the Dark Horse
Comics app, and many other places where fine comic

00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:04.412
books are sold digitally.

00:05:04.412 --> 00:05:05.436
LIAM: Laserdisc.

00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:07.672
MATT: Yes, that too. Let's see.

00:05:07.672 --> 00:05:09.706
LAURA: I have an announcement.

00:05:09.706 --> 00:05:10.592
MATT: Yes, you do.

00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:11.423
LAURA: Is it on the list?

00:05:11.423 --> 00:05:12.441
MATT: I think it might be.

00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:13.735
LAURA: Okay.

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:20.686
MATT: I will be leaving late tonight,
post-midnight, to fly out to Lexington, Kentucky.

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:22.383
TRAVIS: Oh, gross, really?

00:05:22.383 --> 00:05:26.074
MATT: Yeah, but it'll be great. I'll be at the
Lexington Toy and Comic Convention to hang out

00:05:26.074 --> 00:05:29.924
with a bunch of you guys out there in Kentucky! If
you haven't already decided to go, and you're in

00:05:29.924 --> 00:05:33.288
the vicinity, please come! We'll have panels and
signings and be around. We can hang out, swap

00:05:33.288 --> 00:05:34.988
stories, and be general nerds.

00:05:34.988 --> 00:05:36.773
LAURA: Are you leaving from here to there?

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:39.621
MATT: I'm leaving from here to home, to pack, and
then leaving.

00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:41.229
LAURA: You haven't packed!

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.877
MATT: I had to finish campaign prep.

00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:44.774
LAURA: Oh no, Matthew.

00:05:44.774 --> 00:05:52.029
MATT: It's a sprint every day! It'll be fine.
Laura, you had an announcement.

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:59.245
LAURA: Yes, I do! Oh my gosh, you guys,
merchandise! Number one, the tarot cards, which a

00:05:59.245 --> 00:06:04.700
lot of people have been asking about, are back in
stock right now in the Geek &amp; Sundry store. Number

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:11.561
two and three, check out these fabulous, fabulous
T-shirts!

00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:13.229
SAM: These are new T-shirts!

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.554
LAURA: Look at this, our throwback shirt! And we
redid our logo shirt in new sophisticated--

00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:23.105
TALIESIN: Darkest timeline Critical Role. Critical
Role darkest timeline.

00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:25.345
LAURA: If you're looking for them, they're not in
the store now. We wanted to announce them--

00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:26.591
SAM: Wait, they're not?

00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:30.609
LAURA: I know. They're going to be available next
Thursday. We're announcing them right now so that

00:06:30.609 --> 00:06:32.289
those of you that don't see this live--

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.078
MARISHA: People on YouTube always get mad at us.

00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:37.121
TALIESIN: This is a little love to YouTube. Now
you've got four days to figure your stuff out.

00:06:37.121 --> 00:06:40.631
TRAVIS: Think about the Europes and the other
places that are asleeps.

00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:43.172
MARISHA: Those people you just addressed.

00:06:43.172 --> 00:06:45.395
LAURA: They're going to be there on Thursday next
week.

00:06:45.395 --> 00:06:47.995
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Laura.

00:06:47.995 --> 00:06:50.977
LAURA: Thanks, everybody, for talking over my
fucking announcement.

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:53.078
TRAVIS: Hey, it's okay, baby. It's okay.

00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:56.700
MATT: You got this, Travis. This is all you.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.117
TRAVIS: I know.

00:06:58.117 --> 00:06:59.657
MARISHA: Pregnant rage.

00:06:59.657 --> 00:07:03.522
LIAM: You son of a bitch!

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:08.153
TRAVIS: (pretend cries) You want some pickle
juice?

00:07:08.153 --> 00:07:15.477
MATT: Last but not least, we have a cool
announcement for an upcoming event. For those of

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:24.192
you who are in, around, or planning to visit
Chicago in April for C2E2, I think pretty much the

00:07:24.192 --> 00:07:30.633
whole cast, aside from Ashley who will be filming,
will all be there for Critical Role panels,

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:37.506
signing events, all that fun stuff. In Chicago,
April 7th on Saturday and April 8th on Sunday,

00:07:37.506 --> 00:07:39.678
we'll be there to party in Chicago.

00:07:39.678 --> 00:07:43.809
TRAVIS: Panels and autographs. We loved the
critters that came out to Seattle. Chicago, it's

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:46.018
time to represent.

00:07:46.018 --> 00:07:47.689
SAM: I want to taste some bratwurst.

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:49.140
MATT: That can be done.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.103
SAM: Some beers. I want some Chicago-style pizza.

00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:57.261
MATT: Bring all those for Sam at the signing.

00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:03.955
LAURA: By the way, this isn't an announcement, but
I think it's important, that I only chose from

00:08:03.955 --> 00:08:10.308
dice that were given to me in Seattle for my dice
that I was rolling tonight.

00:08:10.308 --> 00:08:16.701
TALIESIN: I may have picked from the remains,
carrion-like, as well.

00:08:17.214 --> 00:08:20.784
LIAM: I would like to announce a small amount of
progress for Laura Bailey, who resisted the urge

00:08:20.784 --> 00:08:25.349
to keep a super cool d20 for herself, which she
wanted to do. She gave it to me.

00:08:25.349 --> 00:08:27.034
LAURA: I was ordered to, so yes.

00:08:27.034 --> 00:08:28.764
LIAM: Hopefully it stays in my bag.

00:08:28.764 --> 00:08:30.108
LAURA: Maybe.

00:08:30.108 --> 00:08:31.987
MARISHA: I have one final announcement.

00:08:31.987 --> 00:08:32.868
MATT: Okay.

00:08:32.868 --> 00:08:40.605
MARISHA: Key Question just came out on Tuesday!
It's a show that Key and I created. We talk about

00:08:40.605 --> 00:08:47.877
Deadpool-- Matt Key! Watch Alpha! For those who
want to watch it and don't want to pay for Alpha,

00:08:47.877 --> 00:08:54.099
you can get a free 60 days with the promo code
"question." There were a ton of people who

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:59.481
responded to my tweet with the promo code in it
saying, "Yeah, but I don't want to have to pay for

00:08:59.481 --> 00:09:09.418
Alpha." You need to read further down the tweet.
I'm telling you now! Promo code Alpha-- no. Promo

00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:15.276
code for Alpha: Question. 60 days. Go watch shit.

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:18.372
TRAVIS: Roll a d20 real quick, just for that.

00:09:19.114 --> 00:09:21.319
MARISHA: Not bad, I did okay.

00:09:21.319 --> 00:09:26.207
MATT: The full schedule will be announced for us
at C2E2 early next week. You can buy tickets at

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.902
c2e2.com, and tomorrow is the deadline to order
badges to receive them by mail, so any badge

00:09:31.902 --> 00:09:36.477
orders after that will have to be held at will
call. Just a heads up! I think that's the last of

00:09:36.477 --> 00:09:43.279
our announcements. With that, let's jump in to
tonight's episode of Critical Role!

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.758
[click, TV static]

00:09:48.787 --> 00:09:55.716
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:08.138
MATT: Welcome back.

00:11:08.138 --> 00:11:10.390
(laughing)

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:24.138
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, the newly
decided-upon title for this adventuring group was

00:11:24.138 --> 00:11:31.897
announced to Bryce, and as such you are now
referred to as the Mighty Nein.

00:11:32.032 --> 00:11:34.085
ALL: Nein!

00:11:34.085 --> 00:11:36.564
MATT: The Mighty No, in Zemnian.

00:11:36.564 --> 00:11:38.858
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Big nope.

00:11:38.858 --> 00:11:47.555
MATT: Upon finishing your business in Alfield, you
acquired your new cart, new horses, and found your

00:11:47.555 --> 00:11:53.433
way on the Amber Road northward for a number of
days, making your way toward Zadash. Along the

00:11:53.433 --> 00:12:01.818
way, you had some curious naps, you found some
cool little landmarks from a war long past, you

00:12:01.818 --> 00:12:12.629
were nearly robbed and instead shooed them off
with cries of extreme syphilis, and then entered

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:18.105
the gates of Zadash yourselves. Upon which, you
briefly met a character named Ulysses, who

00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:24.731
offered, at a bit of cost, to show you around town
for the remainder of the day. Unfortunately, the

00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:29.976
sun set within the next couple of hours, but you
were led toward the Pentamarket, where you did a

00:12:29.976 --> 00:12:34.508
little bit of shopping, offloaded some things
you'd acquired in your previous venture in the

00:12:34.508 --> 00:12:40.073
mines where you battled the gnolls, encountered a
purveyor of various magical artifacts named

00:12:40.073 --> 00:12:49.345
Enchanter Pumat Sol, acquired some baked goods
from the market, and then finished up by making

00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:57.285
your way to The Leaky Tap, where you had just
begun to cross the threshold when we left off last

00:12:57.285 --> 00:13:11.282
week. With that, coming in out of the now-cold
night air, mouths filled with various crumbs and

00:13:11.282 --> 00:13:18.214
residue of sweets having been consumed on the
walk, you enter the darkened interior of The Leaky

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:26.104
Tap. Now, The Leaky Tap itself is a simple, but
very large tavern. You can see there's space here

00:13:26.104 --> 00:13:33.162
for at least a dozen tables, and chairs and stools
crowded around. While it lacks decor, it seems to

00:13:33.162 --> 00:13:40.657
have charm, with a rather ratty-looking band in
the corner that's playing mostly on-key. It

00:13:40.657 --> 00:13:47.351
appears that a number of people who have found
their way-- this is the Eastern Outersteads, I

00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:52.784
believe-- have wandered in to spend whatever
coppers they want to throw towards a drink to send

00:13:52.784 --> 00:13:58.246
their cares away for the evening, and/or argue
with each other about how better to make the day

00:13:58.246 --> 00:14:03.055
before them. Upon stepping into the chamber, you
can see there's already about 25 patrons scattered

00:14:03.055 --> 00:14:08.668
amongst the tables, and the evening appears to be
slowly crawling to more of a roar. There's chatter

00:14:08.668 --> 00:14:13.001
and whispers, there's laughter and the clanks of
metal and glass. You can see already there's one

00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:21.540
long bar on the far end of the room that is broken
in the center for a number of entryway hatches,

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:27.972
and two busied bartenders rushing back and forth.
What do you guys want to do?

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:39.224
SAM: I, Sam Riegel, want to go back and see Pumat
Sol again. But that would not make narrative

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:40.698
sense.

00:14:40.698 --> 00:14:42.777
MATT: There's always tomorrow.

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:51.410
MARISHA: Can I do a quick case of the room? See if
I see anybody suspicious?

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.832
TRAVIS: Give them the old evil eye?

00:14:54.832 --> 00:14:57.166
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:14:57.943 --> 00:15:00.114
TRAVIS: Come on, first roll of the night.

00:15:00.114 --> 00:15:06.611
MARISHA: Perception check. Okay, that's not too
bad. 15.

00:15:06.611 --> 00:15:16.298
MATT: 15, okay. Glancing about, most of the
patrons in here range from somewhat dusty,

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:22.671
destitute clothing that looks to be torn and
ragged at the edges. Some can be farm hands, but

00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:27.774
most of the farm work you've seen is done on the
outskirts of the outer walls of Zadash, but you've

00:15:27.774 --> 00:15:31.638
also walked through folks in the street that sit
on the side peddling handcrafted wares and

00:15:31.638 --> 00:15:38.946
whatever they can muster to try and make ends meet
on the outskirts of the city proper. You notice

00:15:38.946 --> 00:15:45.889
two fairly dressed individuals compared to the
rest that are in the process of doing a quick game

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:50.816
of cards. You can see a large group of people that
are just beginning to gather and keeping an eye

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:54.829
out towards the door if anybody else they
recognize is going to come in. Looks to be about

00:15:54.829 --> 00:16:03.804
eight or so strong, with younger half-elf woman or
so who, as you guys enter, sees you, glances over,

00:16:03.995 --> 00:16:07.266
then shakes her head and goes back to
conversation.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:08.505
SAM: Bachelorette party.

00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:11.838
MATT: Oh, straight up. You can see the whole
banner on the--

00:16:11.838 --> 00:16:13.879
MARISHA: Penis necklaces.

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:16.725
TRAVIS: Dick whistle. Yeah.

00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:19.171
LIAM: Except this is D&amp;D so they're real penises.

00:16:19.171 --> 00:16:21.398
MARISHA: Gnoll penises, yeah.

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:25.106
MATT: Cast Identify on that.

00:16:25.106 --> 00:16:27.744
LIAM: Ten gold a head.

00:16:27.744 --> 00:16:32.171
MATT: The attunement process is a little weird.
Anyway.

00:16:34.777 --> 00:16:38.200
LIAM: I'm at a bar, that's the way it goes.

00:16:39.597 --> 00:16:46.586
MATT: You do see one of the barkeeps leaves behind
and gives a finger off to the other one to pick up

00:16:46.586 --> 00:16:54.875
the slack. The one leaving looks to be an elven
woman, what would look to be the equivalent of a

00:16:54.875 --> 00:17:01.300
human 40s or so, so who knows how long her actual
elven age is. Looks graceful, looking a bit

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:10.362
disheveled, hair pulled back and tied into a small
haphazard bun, simple apron, washing up her hands

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:18.916
and toweling them off as she passes off the full
bar to a male dragonborn. White-scaled, plump

00:17:18.916 --> 00:17:26.213
physique, he himself is wearing a similar apron
with a big smile on his face. He seems jolly,

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:30.494
rushing back and forth taking orders, filling
drinks, and looks like even though he's a bit

00:17:30.494 --> 00:17:36.148
stressed at the moment, having to take the slack,
is handling it with a smile and is used to the

00:17:36.148 --> 00:17:39.053
usual evening ruckus.

00:17:39.053 --> 00:17:44.125
MARISHA: And so the two, the dragonborn and the
female elven lady seem to be running the joint.

00:17:44.125 --> 00:17:45.489
MATT: They seem to be, yeah.

00:17:45.489 --> 00:17:46.555
MARISHA: Copy that.

00:17:46.555 --> 00:17:48.189
TRAVIS: I figure we want some drinks and food,
yeah?

00:17:48.404 --> 00:17:51.660
LAURA: And also we should rent some rooms.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.179
MARISHA: Hey, Jester, it looks like there's a game
of cards going on over there.

00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:58.276
LAURA: Oh, okay, I will--

00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:00.248
MARISHA: Just tossing it out there.

00:18:00.248 --> 00:18:01.554
LAURA: I will do that.

00:18:01.554 --> 00:18:03.500
MARISHA: You don't have to take my--

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.143
TRAVIS: Or you could eat first; we've been
traveling--

00:18:05.143 --> 00:18:06.337
LAURA: I'm gone.

00:18:07.427 --> 00:18:11.453
LIAM: I saw that you were eyeballing the room.
<i>Alles gut?</i>

00:18:11.566 --> 00:18:13.080
MARISHA: What?

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.462
LIAM: Everything is good?

00:18:14.462 --> 00:18:21.820
MARISHA: Yeah, it's fine. Yeah. Seems like a room.
People in it.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.865
LIAM: That is accurate.

00:18:22.865 --> 00:18:23.772
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:18:23.772 --> 00:18:25.635
TRAVIS: Sir, can I bother you for a second?

00:18:25.635 --> 00:18:30.436
MATT: At that point, and hand comes up and he
goes, "Excuse me, just a moment." Fills up two

00:18:30.436 --> 00:18:35.878
tankards on the side, slides them down a bit,
grabs a couple silver, pockets it, comes back.

00:18:35.878 --> 00:18:37.252
TRAVIS: He's busy.

00:18:37.252 --> 00:18:44.138
MATT: Turns back to you, and maybe a good solid
inch or two taller than you, a burly-looking

00:18:44.138 --> 00:18:45.112
dragonborn--

00:18:45.112 --> 00:18:46.161
TRAVIS: (whistles)

00:18:46.161 --> 00:18:47.982
LAURA: He's not that tall. You're not Grog
anymore.

00:18:47.982 --> 00:18:50.206
TRAVIS: Who's that?

00:18:50.206 --> 00:18:57.061
MATT: With a dangerous-looking front of the snout,
that as soon as it spins to you and he looks at

00:18:57.061 --> 00:19:01.273
you with this big, toothy grin, you can see scars
in areas where it's been split in the past. This

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:08.307
guy's seen some rough action in his past. But as
soon as the large dragon mouth curls up into this

00:19:08.307 --> 00:19:14.022
smile, the golden yellow eyes peeking from behind
these stark white scales, themselves look a bit

00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:15.288
dusty--

00:19:15.288 --> 00:19:16.298
LIAM: White scales?

00:19:16.298 --> 00:19:19.140
MATT: Yes. "Right, so what can I do for you?"

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.849
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we just grab any booth or table
that's available? We're looking for some food and

00:19:23.849 --> 00:19:24.967
drink this evening.

00:19:24.967 --> 00:19:28.753
MATT: "Oh food and drink, I can go ahead and get
started, at least get the order in the kitchen.

00:19:28.753 --> 00:19:35.055
Pick a table, sit a spell, rack up. You paying up
front, or you like a tab?"

00:19:35.055 --> 00:19:37.767
TRAVIS: I think a tab. Yeah?

00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:41.493
TALIESIN: A tab with a conversation of possible
rooms for rent later.

00:19:41.493 --> 00:19:46.461
MATT: "Oh. How many rooms you looking? (louder)
I'll be right with you, hold your shit! Yes?"

00:19:46.461 --> 00:19:48.350
MARISHA: How many rooms you got?

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:54.083
MATT: Looks under the counter real fast. Pulls out
a small board.

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:57.232
TRAVIS: Three rooms.

00:19:57.232 --> 00:20:01.287
MATT: "Oh, we got plenty, we've got like seven of
them open. Three rooms, and a tab under the

00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:02.645
name--"

00:20:04.315 --> 00:20:05.733
SAM and TALIESIN: Nein.

00:20:07.877 --> 00:20:09.002
TALIESIN: Nein.

00:20:09.002 --> 00:20:09.833
SAM: Just Nein.

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:11.043
TALIESIN: Nein will do.

00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:12.841
MATT: "There's six of you."

00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:15.414
TALIESIN: N-I-E-N, Nein.

00:20:15.513 --> 00:20:21.911
MATT: "Oh, Zemnian. Fucking weird. All right."

00:20:21.911 --> 00:20:24.540
LIAM: It is one of the languages of the country.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.510
SAM: It's a lovely language.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.433
MARISHA: What was your name?

00:20:29.433 --> 00:20:32.287
MATT: "Me? I'm Wessek the Trim."

00:20:32.287 --> 00:20:34.451
MARISHA: Wessek the Trim.

00:20:34.451 --> 00:20:36.135
LIAM: Good name.

00:20:36.135 --> 00:20:37.842
SAM: We have the same middle name!

00:20:37.842 --> 00:20:39.740
MATT: "Purveyor of the bar here--"

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.779
TALIESIN: Is he, in fact, trim?

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:43.827
MATT: No, he is a plump dragonborn.

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:45.740
TALIESIN: Just checking if it was an ironic
nickname or not.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:51.611
MATT: He has lived a happy midlife. "I'm purveyor
of drinks and keeper of food here at the Leaky

00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:58.372
Tap. Happy to get your food orders in, get some
drinks to your table. Sit back, relax. There's

00:20:58.372 --> 00:21:02.761
usually a show at some point in the night."

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:06.062
LAURA: I'm hopping over to the card game.

00:21:06.062 --> 00:21:13.769
SAM: I'm going to tag along beside her. Hey, do I
see any other goblins in this bar?

00:21:13.769 --> 00:21:15.683
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:21:16.336 --> 00:21:18.239
SAM: Two.

00:21:18.239 --> 00:21:23.297
MATT: No. In fact, from your height, just a lot of
bums.

00:21:23.297 --> 00:21:24.659
LAURA: A lot of butts.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.502
MATT: A whole lot of butts in there.

00:21:26.502 --> 00:21:28.844
SAM: I'm going to assume that I'm okay then.

00:21:28.844 --> 00:21:31.441
TRAVIS: Any other half-orcs in this bar?

00:21:31.441 --> 00:21:39.052
MATT: You do not see any half-orcs in this bar. As
you go over to the table, the two gentlemen who

00:21:39.052 --> 00:21:45.998
are playing cards, you sit down and glance. One of
them looks to be an older man in his 50s or so,

00:21:45.998 --> 00:21:54.962
his pattern baldness curling back, but has this
curled mush of brown, now graying, hair on the

00:21:54.962 --> 00:22:01.324
outskirts of it. He's wearing a billowing shirt of
a nicer silk. That's why it caught your eye. These

00:22:01.324 --> 00:22:04.841
two seem, not extremely well-off by any means, but
at least better than a lot of the other riff-raff

00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:07.940
that are finding their way in, including you
guys.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.334
LAURA: My dress is nice, I don't know what you're
talking about.

00:22:10.334 --> 00:22:14.042
MATT: Your dress is pretty nice, you're right.
That's true. The other one is in the process of

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:21.162
heavily concentrating on his hand. This one looks
a lot younger. He has this scraggly mustache. It

00:22:21.162 --> 00:22:27.330
looks like he's probably been growing it since
childhood, and has let it go in its glory. He has

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:34.006
a button-up high collar bit and a cravat that has
loosened and fallen. Both of these gentlemen, upon

00:22:34.006 --> 00:22:39.322
a closer look, look like they're dressing up
beyond their station, and at the end of the night

00:22:39.322 --> 00:22:44.690
have come to alleviate their stresses with drink
and yelling at each other over cards.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.442
LAURA: Hop, hop. I sit down.

00:22:47.442 --> 00:22:48.668
MATT: "Yes?"

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:53.802
LAURA: What are we playing? Are we playing Go
Fish, or War, or--

00:22:53.802 --> 00:23:01.235
MATT: They both stop mid-conversation and glance
over. "We're playing whatever suits us at the

00:23:01.235 --> 00:23:02.874
moment. We're in the midst-- "

00:23:02.874 --> 00:23:05.142
LAURA: What is suiting you right now?

00:23:05.142 --> 00:23:11.027
MATT: "Well, we are in the moment finishing a
quick game of poker. If you would be so kind as to

00:23:11.027 --> 00:23:15.251
leave us to our game in peace, that would be
appreciated."

00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:19.573
LAURA: I will play with you! I'm not very good, so
you can take so much money from me.

00:23:19.712 --> 00:23:23.274
MARISHA: Yes! Grift it, girl!

00:23:23.274 --> 00:23:25.362
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:23:25.492 --> 00:23:31.976
TALIESIN: I am watching this from the table. This
is the show.

00:23:32.239 --> 00:23:33.809
LAURA: 17.

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:40.628
MATT: 17. The younger one, who was talking to you,
glances over to the older gentleman, who's in the

00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:45.850
process of glancing back, and they take a moment
and they both look back to you together. "I

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.769
suppose, if you want to buy in, then that is your
choice."

00:23:50.379 --> 00:23:53.465
LAURA: You can finish your game though, I'll just
watch.

00:23:53.786 --> 00:24:00.325
MATT: They wordlessly continue the game. They
begin arguing over the process of rising prices

00:24:00.325 --> 00:24:07.180
between irons coming down from the Druvenlode
city, which is one of the larger mining cities in

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:12.895
the empire. They begin to also discuss the quality
of alcohol, seems to be diminishing the more they

00:24:12.895 --> 00:24:18.792
drink. Eventually, with one final hand, the
younger one slaps down his cards, and the older

00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:24.281
one in frustration goes, "Fine! You win."

00:24:24.281 --> 00:24:28.303
LAURA: I applaud the younger guy. What do you want
to play, Nott? Do you want to play?

00:24:28.303 --> 00:24:31.562
SAM: I'll just watch for now. Do you want me go
get you a drink and bring it back, or are you

00:24:31.562 --> 00:24:32.309
okay?

00:24:32.309 --> 00:24:34.559
LAURA: No, unless you want to get some milk.

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:36.189
SAM: I'll just watch for now.

00:24:36.189 --> 00:24:38.320
LAURA: Okay. What is the buy-in?

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.490
MATT: "What do you wish to play?"

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.072
LAURA: What do <i>you</i> wish to play?

00:24:45.532 --> 00:24:53.396
MATT: For the sake of ease of the sudden card
game, he looks around at the other guy. "Do you

00:24:53.396 --> 00:24:55.156
know the Crick-Queen's Call?"

00:24:55.156 --> 00:24:58.767
LAURA: I do! I love it, this is the one I was
telling you about!

00:24:58.767 --> 00:24:59.638
SAM: You were?

00:24:59.638 --> 00:25:01.347
LAURA: Yeah, remember, with the three cards?

00:25:01.347 --> 00:25:02.647
SAM: Oh, yes, I remember.

00:25:02.647 --> 00:25:05.341
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:25:05.341 --> 00:25:13.387
MATT: "Very well, then." He goes to shuffle the
cards rather rapidly before he begins dealing out

00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:15.067
the early sets.

00:25:15.067 --> 00:25:16.856
TALIESIN: Is it a clean shuffle?

00:25:16.856 --> 00:25:18.386
MATT: You may make a perception check.

00:25:18.386 --> 00:25:20.967
LAURA: I would watch that, too. Are you watching
this?

00:25:22.307 --> 00:25:24.097
TALIESIN: Nope, I don't see shit.

00:25:24.332 --> 00:25:26.448
LAURA: I would be watching this, too, because I'm
kind of a--

00:25:26.448 --> 00:25:28.084
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:25:28.084 --> 00:25:34.636
LIAM: A question. Is there any rafters, or any
high place in the room behind these gentlemen?

00:25:34.636 --> 00:25:41.636
MATT: There are rafters, yeah. It's not a very
high peaked ceiling. The actual roofing element of

00:25:41.636 --> 00:25:47.170
this, at least, begins about twelve feet up, and
there's a small space before the beams meet the

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.934
top.

00:25:48.934 --> 00:25:54.396
LIAM: For the moment I scootch Frumpkin down to the
floor and send him off towards behind these

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.710
gentlemen to hang around under that spot, for the
moment.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.496
MATT: All right.

00:25:59.496 --> 00:26:01.788
LAURA: 22 perception.

00:26:01.788 --> 00:26:06.008
MATT: It seems to be a clean shuffle, and a clean
deal.

00:26:06.008 --> 00:26:11.497
LAURA: Do we put two gold in, or some silver?

00:26:11.497 --> 00:26:14.808
MATT: Both the guys look at each other again,
their eyes a little wide. "Two gold would suffice,

00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:17.067
yes. Of course."

00:26:17.067 --> 00:26:18.758
LAURA: Okay.

00:26:18.758 --> 00:26:22.500
MATT: He strokes his way-too-soft mustache.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.735
TRAVIS: Not-all-there mustache.

00:26:25.735 --> 00:26:29.632
LIAM: Nott, I think you're too young to be
watching this. You should come sit with me over

00:26:29.632 --> 00:26:30.714
here.

00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:32.348
SAM: It's very fascinating, though.

00:26:32.348 --> 00:26:34.830
LIAM: No, it's a bad idea. You're too little for
gambling.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.879
LAURA: You're not too little, Nott, you're not.

00:26:36.879 --> 00:26:43.166
SAM: She doesn't think I am, but if Caleb says so,
then I should go with Caleb. Good luck!

00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:45.259
LIAM: Use your skill.

00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:47.017
LAURA: Okay!

00:26:47.017 --> 00:26:51.272
MARISHA: I'm confused. Is she actually that young,
or is that part of the game?

00:26:51.272 --> 00:26:53.387
LIAM: Come, let us go sit over here.

00:26:53.387 --> 00:26:55.067
MARISHA: Is that part of the scam?

00:26:55.067 --> 00:26:56.468
LIAM: I walked away from this one.

00:26:56.468 --> 00:27:00.319
MATT: Two gold on the table from each of you, so
that's six gold in the full pot. Go ahead and make

00:27:00.463 --> 00:27:02.283
your roll, 3d6.

00:27:02.283 --> 00:27:05.836
SAM: Ooh. What do you do, take the best two? What
do you do?

00:27:05.836 --> 00:27:07.137
LAURA: No, no, no.

00:27:07.137 --> 00:27:09.676
MATT: Everyone rolls, and then you can raise your
ante.

00:27:09.676 --> 00:27:15.011
LAURA: Wait. I'm going to try to use one of my own
cards and try to replace one of the cards.

00:27:15.011 --> 00:27:16.635
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:20.415
LIAM: Frumpkin climbs up into the rafters with a
view of the gentleman's cards.

00:27:20.415 --> 00:27:21.364
LAURA: 19.

00:27:21.364 --> 00:27:23.587
MATT: 19? Okay.

00:27:23.587 --> 00:27:26.672
TALIESIN: Can I try to perceive this too?

00:27:26.672 --> 00:27:29.743
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

00:27:33.098 --> 00:27:34.083
TALIESIN: 18.

00:27:34.088 --> 00:27:41.834
MATT: No, you do not. They all look at their
hands. The younger one with the mustache keeps

00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:50.694
stroking the front of his face and goes, "I'll
raise four." You don't roll yet. You have to raise

00:27:50.694 --> 00:27:51.553
first.

00:27:51.553 --> 00:27:54.409
LAURA: I thought I was trying to cheat and replace
one of my things.

00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:55.903
MATT: Oh, you were. Yes, you're right.

00:27:55.903 --> 00:27:57.862
LAURA: Do I get to choose what it is, or do I roll
again?

00:27:57.862 --> 00:27:59.198
MATT: You just roll again.

00:27:59.198 --> 00:28:02.837
LAURA: Okay. I rolled it. It was shit. Okay.

00:28:02.837 --> 00:28:08.739
MATT: He goes, "Raising an additional two gold
pieces."

00:28:08.739 --> 00:28:13.268
LIAM: I would like to start looking at their cards
through Frumpkin's eyes.

00:28:14.948 --> 00:28:20.379
LAURA: I'm definitely raising two. From your two,
I'm going to add in another three. So five extra

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.342
on the table.

00:28:23.292 --> 00:28:25.603
LIAM: (quietly) Get ready to use your wire.

00:28:25.626 --> 00:28:31.802
SAM: Okay. I'm pulling out my thin bit of wire and
I'm getting ready to cast Message.

00:28:31.802 --> 00:28:36.157
TRAVIS: We just can't have a fucking peaceful
drink, can we? Just got to get right into shit.

00:28:36.157 --> 00:28:37.366
Okay.

00:28:37.366 --> 00:28:46.251
MATT: I know. All right. They meet your raise.
That's now 21 gold, I believe, on the table, so

00:28:46.251 --> 00:28:49.444
you all get to draw another card. So reroll one more.

00:28:54.178 --> 00:28:56.147
The older one--

00:28:58.749 --> 00:28:59.778
SAM: Folds?

00:28:59.778 --> 00:29:01.478
MATT: No, he stays.

00:29:01.478 --> 00:29:03.817
LAURA: Okay. The younger one?

00:29:03.817 --> 00:29:06.069
MATT: Perception check.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.982
LIAM: Yeah. That's a 21.

00:29:11.982 --> 00:29:14.303
MATT: 21. Yeah, you can see.

00:29:14.303 --> 00:29:16.300
LAURA: I'll cover my ears so I don't know.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.160
SAM: You're about to know when I whisper it to
you.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.678
LAURA: Oh, okay. Never mind.

00:29:20.678 --> 00:29:25.091
MATT: The younger one has a crap hand. He's trying
to bluff and he's already sweating a bit. The

00:29:25.091 --> 00:29:27.984
older one is looking really good.

00:29:27.984 --> 00:29:36.112
LIAM: Okay. Tell our friend that Mr. Mustache is
sitting pretty and the young boy has <i>Scheiße</i>.

00:29:36.347 --> 00:29:38.403
MATT: Well, the mustache is the younger one. The
older one is--

00:29:38.403 --> 00:29:43.834
LIAM: Reverse that order please. Also, I would
like the curly fries.

00:29:44.425 --> 00:29:49.388
SAM: I point to her and whisper in my bit of
copper wire and do a little hand gesture, and say

00:29:49.388 --> 00:29:55.864
all of that to her. The young one's bluffing! The
old one's got a sick hand! He's going to burn you!

00:29:55.864 --> 00:29:57.657
Burn you good!

00:29:57.657 --> 00:30:03.248
LAURA: Hmm. I'm going to sleight of hand and try
and replace one of my cards.

00:30:03.248 --> 00:30:05.833
TRAVIS: Jesus! In one game?

00:30:05.833 --> 00:30:12.362
MATT: All right, so go attempt it again. Go and
roll a deception-- or sorry sleight of hand.

00:30:12.362 --> 00:30:14.277
LAURA: Oh god.

00:30:14.277 --> 00:30:16.350
MATT: You guys are so honed in on this!

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.906
LAURA: Oh, 16?

00:30:21.756 --> 00:30:22.917
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:30:23.466 --> 00:30:30.206
MATT: The young guy is sweating a bit and he gets
more nervous. He just continues to stroke his

00:30:30.206 --> 00:30:37.390
little caterpillar mustache, quicker and smaller
bits. The older guy who seems to be playing rather

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:51.640
spacey the whole time suddenly zooms in on your
hands and goes, "I do say, I think we're being

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.967
had."

00:30:52.967 --> 00:30:55.069
LAURA: What, by who?

00:30:55.069 --> 00:31:02.594
MATT: He leans forward and pulls one of the cards
that you had slipped into your sleeve, out onto

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:05.108
the table.

00:31:05.108 --> 00:31:11.728
LAURA: Oh, that's weird where did that come from?
I shouldn't wear such loose sleeves, you guys.

00:31:11.728 --> 00:31:13.967
That was really obvious.

00:31:13.967 --> 00:31:20.723
MATT: The old guy stands up and leans forward. You
can see he has this bloodshot corners, a little

00:31:20.723 --> 00:31:27.478
bit where the white show for deep brown irises.
The smell of alcohol and dirt wafts off of him as

00:31:27.478 --> 00:31:36.221
he leans forward. "I will not report you for
cheating, but we will taking the rest of the pot."

00:31:36.464 --> 00:31:39.877
LAURA: Wait, cheating? What are you talking
about?

00:31:39.877 --> 00:31:41.950
MATT: He just takes the coins and scoops them up.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.832
LAURA: Wait, I thought that was part of the game.
Is it not?

00:31:44.832 --> 00:31:46.412
MATT: They get up and leave.

00:31:46.412 --> 00:31:49.030
LAURA: Motherfuckers, they took my money.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.895
SAM: Did you win?

00:31:51.007 --> 00:31:53.321
LAURA: Yes Nott, I won real good.

00:31:53.321 --> 00:31:55.305
SAM: I knew you would.

00:31:55.305 --> 00:31:59.254
LAURA: I only lost seven gold. That was a lot of
fun, you guys. That was a good trick with the

00:31:59.254 --> 00:32:00.567
messages!

00:32:00.567 --> 00:32:03.368
SAM: It didn't seem to help very much, though.

00:32:03.368 --> 00:32:08.161
LAURA: No, but it would have if I had succeeded in
these-- gosh I really need to get tighter sleeves,

00:32:08.161 --> 00:32:09.220
though.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.986
LIAM: Yeah, but that one had potential.

00:32:11.986 --> 00:32:14.393
LAURA: Molly, you have to teach me how to do that
better, okay?

00:32:14.393 --> 00:32:16.770
TRAVIS: She wants to play again, right now.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.049
LAURA: What?

00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:21.202
TRAVIS: What? I said you want to play again, don't
you?

00:32:21.202 --> 00:32:22.750
LAURA: (laughing) So bad.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:25.072
TRAVIS: Yeah Laura's dying on the inside.

00:32:25.072 --> 00:32:26.716
LAURA: (yells)

00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:28.993
SAM: Should we follow them outside and kill them?

00:32:28.993 --> 00:32:30.795
LAURA: Ooh. No, probably not.

00:32:30.795 --> 00:32:31.970
TALIESIN: That doesn't seem very nice.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.111
LIAM: Why don't instead we have something to drink
and eat.

00:32:34.111 --> 00:32:36.276
TRAVIS: I agree with you 100%.

00:32:36.276 --> 00:32:37.718
LAURA: You know what else we should do?

00:32:37.718 --> 00:32:39.309
TALIESIN: Follow them outside and rob them?

00:32:39.309 --> 00:32:40.633
TRAVIS: Molly, come on now.

00:32:40.633 --> 00:32:41.503
TALIESIN: Sorry.

00:32:41.503 --> 00:32:42.419
LAURA: Did we get rooms?

00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:43.286
TALIESIN: We did get rooms.

00:32:43.286 --> 00:32:44.345
LAURA: Yay. Are we roommates?

00:32:44.345 --> 00:32:45.501
MARISHA: Roomies!

00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:49.426
MATT: Dinner arrives, drinks have been provided.
You guys are able to use your meal and figure out

00:32:49.426 --> 00:32:52.174
who you want to talk to, what you want to do, your
business.

00:32:52.174 --> 00:32:53.986
LAURA: We should look for Claudia.

00:32:53.986 --> 00:32:57.264
SAM: We were told that there was Claudia Sheet
here.

00:32:57.264 --> 00:32:58.110
LAURA: Sheed.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.479
SAM: Sheed. Sheedy. Ally Sheedy is here.

00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:02.296
MARISHA: Oh I love her.

00:33:02.296 --> 00:33:04.104
TRAVIS: Sheed or Sheen?

00:33:04.104 --> 00:33:05.026
MATT: Sheed.

00:33:05.026 --> 00:33:06.348
SAM: Charlie Sheen.

00:33:06.348 --> 00:33:11.127
LIAM: Only I get to say <i>Schiet</i>, you have to say
Sheed.

00:33:11.127 --> 00:33:16.993
SAM: She's probably the elven woman working at the
bar since we were told she works here, right?

00:33:16.993 --> 00:33:18.120
TALIESIN: Claudia Sheed?

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.044
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:19.044 --> 00:33:19.847
TALIESIN: Claudia Sheed.

00:33:19.847 --> 00:33:20.584
LAURA: Let's ask about--

00:33:20.584 --> 00:33:21.805
TALIESIN: (yelling) Claudia Sheed!

00:33:21.805 --> 00:33:24.057
TRAVIS: Yeah, go get her, Molly.

00:33:24.057 --> 00:33:30.493
MATT: As you're shouting this out, some people
start looking over, curious as this very

00:33:30.493 --> 00:33:36.950
ostentatiously dressed tiefling starts shouting
essentially the owner of the tavern out in the

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:45.671
center of the tavern. No one seems to make any
physical action towards it. However, Wessek points

00:33:45.671 --> 00:33:49.998
over towards you. "Oh, she took some time off.
She's up in her office, sorry."

00:33:49.998 --> 00:33:51.760
TALIESIN: Brilliant, thank you.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.178
TRAVIS: That was very effective.

00:33:54.178 --> 00:33:59.836
TALIESIN: I normally find shouting people's names
really loudly tends to bring them to your table.

00:33:59.836 --> 00:34:04.890
TRAVIS: Right. I wonder where her office is.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.185
LAURA: We could ask.

00:34:06.185 --> 00:34:09.829
TALIESIN: We could look. Have we had food and
drink yet?

00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:14.828
MATT: Yeah, you guys have eaten. And now you're in
the process-- you don't have to roleplay every meal.

00:34:14.828 --> 00:34:17.131
(various eating noises)

00:34:17.131 --> 00:34:20.061
TRAVIS: Nott has to roleplay every meal.

00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:24.142
LIAM: What time of the evening do I know it to
be?

00:34:24.142 --> 00:34:28.712
MATT: At this point, it's probably pushing close
to ten o'clock.

00:34:28.712 --> 00:34:31.054
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, okay.

00:34:31.054 --> 00:34:33.005
MATT: The sun's been set for a couple hours.

00:34:33.005 --> 00:34:34.511
LIAM: Yeah, that's late. It's not that late.

00:34:34.511 --> 00:34:37.681
TRAVIS: Anybody feel like going up and giving ole
Claudia a door rap, at her office?

00:34:37.681 --> 00:34:40.075
LIAM: I thought you were going somewhere else, for
a second.

00:34:40.075 --> 00:34:41.194
TRAVIS: No.

00:34:41.194 --> 00:34:45.906
TALIESIN: I'm interested either way. So I'm going
to stand up and start heading upstairs.

00:34:45.906 --> 00:34:48.502
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm bored. Let's go.

00:34:48.502 --> 00:34:51.140
TALIESIN: Come, Unpleasant One, let's go.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:58.099
MARISHA: All right. Obnoxious One, I'm with you.

00:34:58.099 --> 00:35:03.353
MATT: There's a brief spiral staircase towards the
far back that leads to a landing and then the

00:35:03.353 --> 00:35:07.814
second floor. From the outside, you could see 
there were three floors to it. So this probably

00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:11.680
progresses-- there's another staircase further
down the hallway. From the landing up there,

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.317
there's a single doorway that is currently closed.
It has no name on it, but it stands alone from the

00:35:16.317 --> 00:35:19.386
rest of it, and it seems to be in the direction as
to where Wessek was pointing.

00:35:19.386 --> 00:35:27.168
TALIESIN: I'm going to look for what looks like an 
office. For whatever door seems most inconvenient.

00:35:27.168 --> 00:35:29.906
MATT: At a quick glance, the one on the landing.

00:35:29.906 --> 00:35:31.454
TALIESIN: The one on the landing it is.

00:35:31.454 --> 00:35:33.799
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (click and knock the same
pattern)

00:35:33.799 --> 00:35:35.171
SAM: What the fuck was that?

00:35:35.171 --> 00:35:36.847
TRAVIS: Wow, y'all.

00:35:36.847 --> 00:35:45.242
MATT: We've been hanging out far too long. This is
a problem. There's a moment. "Yes, who is it?"

00:35:45.242 --> 00:35:47.998
TALIESIN: Friends from out of town.

00:35:47.998 --> 00:35:52.468
MATT: "More information, please."

00:35:52.468 --> 00:35:55.316
TALIESIN: Bryce sent us.

00:35:55.316 --> 00:35:57.856
MATT: "Bryce who?"

00:35:57.856 --> 00:36:00.842
LAURA: Bryce from Alfield.

00:36:00.842 --> 00:36:01.953
SAM: You're not there.

00:36:01.953 --> 00:36:03.710
LAURA: Yes, I am. We went up there, I thought.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.245
MARISHA: Crownsguard Bryce.

00:36:05.245 --> 00:36:06.812
TALIESIN: From Alfield.

00:36:06.812 --> 00:36:17.828
MATT: "All right, just a moment, please." About 30
or so seconds pass and the door opens, and the same

00:36:17.828 --> 00:36:23.441
elven woman you saw leave from behind the bar
earlier. However, the disheveled appearance you saw

00:36:23.441 --> 00:36:30.611
earlier is gone, is pristine, clean and the hair
is immaculately combed and pulled up into a high

00:36:30.611 --> 00:36:38.797
bun, wearing a deep maroon, almost a silk robe
that is pulled over, arms across.

00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:44.250
LAURA: I was desanitizing him.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:48.413
MATT: Oh, fair enough. "So you are friends of
Bryce."

00:36:48.413 --> 00:36:52.228
TALIESIN: We have come from very far to take a look--

00:36:52.228 --> 00:36:53.262
MARISHA: Converse.

00:36:53.262 --> 00:36:54.168
TALIESIN: Converse.

00:36:54.168 --> 00:36:55.273
MARISHA: Right?

00:36:55.273 --> 00:36:58.901
MATT: "Well, they are a very good friend. And if
you are friends of them, then you are friends of

00:36:58.901 --> 00:37:06.506
"mine. I ask you to enter for the time being and
perhaps we can get to know each other, I suppose,

00:37:06.506 --> 00:37:13.012
"if you have business. Enter, please." She turns and
whips around and heads back inside. This office is

00:37:13.012 --> 00:37:19.317
a simple office. When you consider most of the
offices you've encountered have been in some level of

00:37:19.317 --> 00:37:28.191
empire clerical work, and/or in various
institutions, this is mainly just a desk with a

00:37:28.191 --> 00:37:33.452
chair, some books and ledger information, some
scattered papers, ink and quill, a few books on

00:37:33.452 --> 00:37:38.933
the side. Other than that, it's pretty barren and
simple. There is a window in the back that has a

00:37:38.933 --> 00:37:46.418
crossbeam bisecting it into four squares. It is just
pitch black outside 'cause the rest of it is just

00:37:46.418 --> 00:37:51.498
an alley below. Anyway, she turns around and sits
in the chair and comes back, and crosses her hands

00:37:51.498 --> 00:37:57.382
in front of her with her elbows on the edge of the
table. "All right, you have my attention. What can

00:37:57.382 --> 00:37:58.959
"I do for you?"

00:37:58.959 --> 00:38:08.845
TALIESIN: Well, to wrap it up a bit, we've just
recently got into town. We're looking for

00:38:08.845 --> 00:38:15.670
employment, odd jobs. We were recommended to you
to be the person to talk to about what actually is

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:21.078
going on in this city. We're new to this city, we
don't necessarily have our thumb on the pulse of

00:38:21.078 --> 00:38:22.324
what's going on.

00:38:22.324 --> 00:38:31.261
MATT: "You are here looking for work? Well, for
one, if you are in need of paying work, I always

00:38:31.261 --> 00:38:41.013
"have dishes to wash. But at a quick glance at how
you are presented as a little more capable

00:38:41.013 --> 00:38:46.741
"individuals at first glance, I would say that
perhaps you have other skills. So I would--"

00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:53.300
MARISHA: I do the dude at a bar thing and push up
my biceps.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:57.054
TRAVIS: It works.

00:38:57.054 --> 00:39:02.961
MATT: "If you are better with a blade or
information, then checking at the King's Hall Board

00:39:02.961 --> 00:39:04.763
"might be a solid bet for you."

00:39:04.763 --> 00:39:09.789
TALIESIN: We just figured we would make sure that
you were aware we were here. We don't want to

00:39:09.789 --> 00:39:14.134
ruffle any feathers and we don't necessarily know
who are the right people, the wrong people to work for.

00:39:14.134 --> 00:39:18.596
MATT: "Every person you meet is the right and the
wrong person, depending on where you are coming from."

00:39:18.596 --> 00:39:19.998
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

00:39:19.998 --> 00:39:22.592
MATT: "I guess I would ask what for you is the
wrong type of people?"

00:39:22.592 --> 00:39:25.339
LAURA: Shitty people.

00:39:25.339 --> 00:39:31.167
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'd like to avoid entanglements
with the law, being so new and all.

00:39:31.167 --> 00:39:36.222
MATT: "Right, then perhaps do not punch any
crownsguard and I think you'll be okay."

00:39:36.222 --> 00:39:39.389
TALIESIN: Sounds easy, except it's really not.

00:39:39.389 --> 00:39:43.441
MARISHA: It does seem like crownsguard tend to be
assholes.

00:39:43.441 --> 00:39:45.194
TALISIN: Deeply punchable.

00:39:45.194 --> 00:39:49.358
MARISHA: Have you ever had any issues with the
Crownsguard? We've heard rumors.

00:39:49.358 --> 00:39:55.192
MATT: "I mean, individuals, yes." There's a brief
moment where she looks wistfully into the

00:39:55.192 --> 00:40:06.705
distance. "I've had my encounters, not so much
with Crownsguard, but with other figures."

00:40:06.705 --> 00:40:09.690
MARISHA: Do we need to kick someone's ass for
you?

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.078
MATT: "Oh, I've already made sure their ass has
been thoroughly kicked."

00:40:13.078 --> 00:40:17.415
TRAVIS: Maybe it might be wise to ask
any particular groups to avoid while we're here.

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:31.437
MATT: She crosses her arms for a second.
"Interesting point. Where are you from? Have you

00:40:31.437 --> 00:40:33.647
"always lived in the empire?"

00:40:33.647 --> 00:40:38.860
LAURA: No, I'm from-- you're from Port Damali.
I'm from Nicodranas.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:48.473
MATT: "From the Menagerie Coast. You are in for a
treat of comparably colorful times. But a probably

00:40:48.473 --> 00:41:02.129
"less jovial atmosphere in places. You know about
the religious control, correct?"

00:41:02.129 --> 00:41:04.632
TRAVIS: We're slightly aware.

00:41:04.632 --> 00:41:05.988
LAURA: Wait, what?

00:41:05.988 --> 00:41:07.497
TRAVIS: Well, they frown--

00:41:07.497 --> 00:41:09.384
TALIESIN: Grace of the Platinum Dragon.

00:41:09.384 --> 00:41:21.084
MATT: "There are-- for well over a century now, the
worship of various deities in the empire has been

00:41:21.084 --> 00:41:30.422
"controlled. There are shrines throughout the city.
Most cities contain a shrine of some kind to the

00:41:30.422 --> 00:41:36.598
"approved worships. I just want to ensure that, if
you do not fall into this realm, you do not go

00:41:36.598 --> 00:41:41.700
"flashing it about, because that will get you very
easily put into the Umber Dungeon and that is not

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.101
"a place you want to be."

00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:45.350
LAURA: Where are these shrines that you are
talking about?

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:52.226
MATT: "They are scattered about. For instance,
there is the Allhammer. Their shrine is-- let me

00:41:52.226 --> 00:41:54.971
"think for a second," as I consult my notes.

00:41:54.971 --> 00:41:57.698
TRAVIS: Yeah, getting the good shit right now.

00:41:57.698 --> 00:41:59.950
MARISHA: The Umber Dungeon?

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:06.698
MATT: The Umber Dungeon. "There is the Hearth of
the Allhammer that is existing in the Pentamarket."

00:42:06.698 --> 00:42:09.358
LAURA: Ooh, we were just there!

00:42:09.358 --> 00:42:17.991
MATT: "Look for the domed iron structure. It may
be a bit rusty, not in the best upkeep. It's hard

00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:23.472
"to miss the interior with the very heavy,
beautiful anvil, for both craftwork of those that

00:42:23.472 --> 00:42:30.955
"maintain a position. What else do you want
to know about it? There is the Raven's Den, which

00:42:31.123 --> 00:42:32.940
is in the center of the graveyard."

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.438
LAURA: That sounds good, too.

00:42:34.438 --> 00:42:43.824
MATT: "The Ossuary Gates is the multilayered
catacomb graveyard. The Raven's Den exists in the

00:42:43.824 --> 00:42:45.540
"center area of that field."

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:51.190
LAURA: Do the shrines usually have a lot of people
in them?

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:54.926
MATT: "Midday, and depending on which places of
worship they are, yes. But there are Heralds that

00:42:54.926 --> 00:43:03.958
"run each shrine; they work for the empire. They
hold all sermons. They give council to anybody who

00:43:03.958 --> 00:43:09.385
"requires it. It's all pretty much within the
government structure, yes."

00:43:09.385 --> 00:43:15.440
TRAVIS: Are there any particular groups of people
that are responsible for unsavory business in the

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.416
city? Any identifying clothing or memorabilia they
might have on them?

00:43:20.416 --> 00:43:24.710
MATT: "Not visibly, no. There are many people that
work underneath the law here, but they are careful

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:30.413
"enough, if they wish to continue business, to not
show it. I mean, what, are you looking for that

00:43:30.413 --> 00:43:31.536
"kind of work?'

00:43:31.536 --> 00:43:35.963
TRAVIS: No, just perhaps to keep an eye out for in
case we sought employment from the wrong type.

00:43:35.963 --> 00:43:40.407
MARISHA: You know, tourists. We have that tourist
look.

00:43:40.407 --> 00:43:46.425
TALIESIN: Speaking of tourist looks, how much of a
problem would this be in general?

00:43:46.425 --> 00:43:51.435
MATT: "You should be fine. It's-- you should be
fine."

00:43:51.435 --> 00:43:53.132
TALIESIN: Excellent.

00:43:53.132 --> 00:44:02.774
MATT: "For the most part, those of various unique
heritages have harder times at the farther

00:44:02.774 --> 00:44:12.034
"eastern areas, around the garrisons. Those that
have to keep the creatures of Xhorhas at bay, and

00:44:12.034 --> 00:44:18.193
"possibly historians that believe that this is the
Curse of Ghor Dranas, but you know. For the most

00:44:18.193 --> 00:44:24.155
"part, most nobody studies history and just consider
you either unique-looking or will avoid you regardless."

00:44:24.155 --> 00:44:31.380
MARISHA: Wait, no one studies history, really? Do
you not have a good public school system or

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.248
something? I was just curious.

00:44:33.248 --> 00:44:41.085
MAT: "Well, if you want to go study history--" that
would be over here. "In the Interstead Sprawl, we

00:44:41.085 --> 00:44:49.343
"do have the Apple Tree Tutor Village. That is
three long buildings owned and provided by the

00:44:49.343 --> 00:44:56.831
"Soltryce Academy for basic learning to children
and adults of the less affluent lifestyle for a

00:44:56.831 --> 00:44:58.467
"moderate price."

00:44:58.467 --> 00:45:02.768
MARISHA: Like private school?

00:45:02.768 --> 00:45:10.136
MATT: If you're looking for a comparison here, it
would be upper-end public school, if anything.

00:45:10.136 --> 00:45:12.939
LIAM: Charter school?

00:45:12.939 --> 00:45:14.441
MARISHA: Magnet programs?

00:45:14.441 --> 00:45:15.848
MATT: Sure, we'll put it at a charter school.

00:45:15.848 --> 00:45:17.662
LIAM: Lotteries are a bitch!

00:45:17.662 --> 00:45:20.018
MATT: But controlled by the Soltryce Academy.

00:45:20.018 --> 00:45:22.118
MARISHA: All controlled by the Soltryce.

00:45:22.118 --> 00:45:29.765
MATT: Yes. "The head tutor there is an overworked
and relatively stressed-out individual."

00:45:29.765 --> 00:45:31.418
TRAVIS: Head tutor, you said?

00:45:31.418 --> 00:45:41.872
MATT: "Yes. Mikael Drom. Very nice fellow. Eager
to help, but the system has been difficult for him."

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:44.796
TALIESIN: Is there a shrine to the Dragon, as
well?

00:45:44.796 --> 00:45:58.191
MATT: "There is. There is a Platinum House. That
would also be in the Interstead Sprawl. Look for

00:45:58.191 --> 00:46:01.082
"the beautiful white building with deep blue
tapestries on the outside. They're reflective,

00:46:01.082 --> 00:46:06.611
"mirror-like, during the day. It's almost a beacon
for having to shield your eyes. Meditation,

00:46:06.611 --> 00:46:11.919
"worship, is all available within there. Sermon's
usually around noon."

00:46:11.919 --> 00:46:18.727
MARISHA: You mentioned all the sanctioned shrines.
Are there any unsanctioned shrines?

00:46:18.727 --> 00:46:26.821
MATT: "Anything that isn't the Platinum Dragon,
the Raven Queen, Allhammer, Dawnfather, Lawbearer,

00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:28.770
"and the Knowing Mistress."

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.203
MARISHA: So six, that's it?

00:46:30.203 --> 00:46:31.575
MATT: "There are six."

00:46:31.575 --> 00:46:36.270
MARISHA: Six approved gods.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:41.228
LAURA: All of those guys. Of course we knew about
those guys.

00:46:41.228 --> 00:46:45.184
TRAVIS: Jester, now, that doesn't seem to cover
who you're looking for, though.

00:46:45.184 --> 00:46:48.130
LAURA: Oh, well, you know--

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:53.871
MATT: "I don't judge. If you worship what you want,
you can, just be careful about it."

00:46:53.871 --> 00:46:55.151
LAURA: Okay.

00:46:55.151 --> 00:46:56.756
MATT: "Don't tell anyone."

00:46:56.756 --> 00:46:58.584
TALIESIN: Ixnay on the angers-stray.

00:46:58.584 --> 00:47:01.505
LAURA: Okay! I won't tell anyone.

00:47:01.505 --> 00:47:02.753
MATT: "Very well."

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:05.921
SAM: She's going to tell everyone.

00:47:05.921 --> 00:47:13.184
MATT: "That's going to help you. Anything else you
want to know? I've been living here most of my life."

00:47:13.184 --> 00:47:16.158
TRAVIS: Job postings. Anywhere we might go to--

00:47:16.158 --> 00:47:22.934
LAURA: Well, we have the King's Hall board, yo.
That's where the job postings are.

00:47:22.934 --> 00:47:30.041
MATT: "King's Hall is a good resource. If you're
really hit up hard and you want to try the route

00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:33.959
"that Bryce did, you can always sign up to become a
member of the military."

00:47:33.959 --> 00:47:35.013
TALIESIN: Eh.

00:47:35.013 --> 00:47:37.211
LAURA: Go fuck yourself! No!

00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:45.198
MATT: "It works well for some people. It pays, you
are trained. The Righteous Brand is very helpful

00:47:45.198 --> 00:47:49.689
"and helps keep the Empire safe from the terrors
that wander in and beyond the borders."

00:47:49.689 --> 00:47:55.567
TALIESIN: We're also always big fans of
underbellies, especially if there's an underbelly

00:47:55.567 --> 00:47:57.680
with a heart of gold.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.192
LAURA: Especially one if it's furry and you can
pet it.

00:48:00.192 --> 00:48:06.465
MATT: "There are plenty of underbellies, but they
are localized, scattered, and very protective.

00:48:06.465 --> 00:48:09.891
"Keep your ears open, ask the right questions."

00:48:09.891 --> 00:48:13.815
TALIESIN: Are there names that, if we hear, we
should trust?

00:48:13.815 --> 00:48:18.393
MATT: "I don't trust anybody. That's how I'm still
alive and that's how I came to own this tavern."

00:48:18.393 --> 00:48:22.856
MARISHA: Great corner office, by the way. You have
a window!

00:48:22.856 --> 00:48:23.928
MATT: "Thank you."

00:48:23.928 --> 00:48:25.330
MARISHA: That's great.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:33.988
MATT: "I had to change it a bit. The man I took it
all from, I wanted him to leave nothing behind."

00:48:33.988 --> 00:48:37.655
LAURA: Was he perchance named The Gentleman?

00:48:37.823 --> 00:48:43.393
MATT: There's a quick glance in your direction.
Her expression darkens and she goes, "No, but I

00:48:43.393 --> 00:48:45.484
"would be very careful how you use that name."

00:48:45.484 --> 00:48:46.850
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:48.362
MARISHA: Really, now?

00:48:48.362 --> 00:48:50.257
LAURA: Do you know him?

00:48:50.257 --> 00:48:58.343
MATT: "I do not know him, but I know of him. That
thing I said about trying not to get in trouble

00:48:58.343 --> 00:49:05.081
"with the darker elements of the city that might be
in over your head? That is very specifically one

00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:07.040
"who wallows in that mire."

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.349
LAURA: Okay.

00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:14.862
MARISHA: He wallows in the underbelly shit? That's
what you said? That's me asking the DM.

00:49:14.862 --> 00:49:19.482
MATT: Yes, basically, wallows in the mire of the
underbelly shit. Sounds like a fun lyric.

00:49:19.482 --> 00:49:21.503
(singing) Wallows in the mire of the underbelly
shit!

00:49:21.503 --> 00:49:24.204
LAURA: That's the second verse.

00:49:24.204 --> 00:49:34.500
TRAVIS: Well, thank you for your time. I think
we'll find our way back down to the belly of this tavern.

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.213
MATT: "Very well. I will walk you down."

00:49:37.213 --> 00:49:40.129
LIAM: Sorry.

00:49:40.129 --> 00:49:41.042
MATT: "Yes."

00:49:41.042 --> 00:49:44.560
LIAM: I want to touch on something happening--
I'm not there. We're not there.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.687
MATT: Oh, right.

00:49:45.687 --> 00:49:47.441
LIAM: So I want to touch on something that's
happening at the same time, but I will wait until

00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:48.876
you think it's a good moment.

00:49:48.876 --> 00:49:51.279
MATT: Sure. You can do it now while they're
exiting the office. While they've been in there--

00:49:51.279 --> 00:49:57.248
LIAM: Yeah. Nott and Caleb didn't go up. They're
busy. Would you like to learn something interesting?

00:49:57.248 --> 00:49:58.929
SAM: A magic trick?

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:00.191
LIAM: Sort of.

00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:01.270
SAM: Yes!

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:08.492
LIAM: It's a little homework and a little bit
magic trick. This is where I keep my spells. This

00:50:08.492 --> 00:50:20.555
is my book. And this is the piece of luck that you
helped me achieve in Trostenwald. Over the months

00:50:20.555 --> 00:50:28.940
and years, I gather the amount of magic tricks that
I can do. So in this book, for instance, there is

00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:37.538
a new spell that I do not even know how to use
myself where I can make an invisible helper. What

00:50:37.538 --> 00:50:43.055
is going to happen now, I bought supplies for it--
I find a booth for us in the corner-- is I am

00:50:43.055 --> 00:50:47.278
going to move it from here into here and I thought
you could help me. Would you like to do that?

00:50:47.278 --> 00:50:48.441
SAM: Yes!

00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:51.021
LIAM: Okay. So you can see--

00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:52.617
SAM: Photocopying!

00:50:52.617 --> 00:50:54.930
TRAVIS: Xerox!

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:59.885
LIAM: I don't know what that means, but this will
take a little while. Here, hold this. I hand a

00:50:59.885 --> 00:51:07.966
quill to her. Hold that. You can see the markings
on this page. It's intricate, but you can do the

00:51:07.966 --> 00:51:14.933
first few strokes. It needs to look like that, it
needs to go here. I guide her hand a little bit to

00:51:14.933 --> 00:51:19.238
make sure that it doesn't smudge too much. It's
still workable. Good. Now I will fill in the

00:51:19.238 --> 00:51:26.548
details. I spend the next-- they are probably gone
for 15 minutes-- putting down the glyphs and

00:51:26.548 --> 00:51:27.684
the markings.

00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:28.900
SAM: It's delightful!

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:34.636
LIAM: And begin the first 30 minutes of the two
hours I need to spend copying this.

00:51:34.636 --> 00:51:40.573
SAM: Too much. I'll need to be plied with many
drinks.

00:51:40.573 --> 00:51:45.709
LIAM: Oh, yeah. Sliding them over.

00:51:45.709 --> 00:51:47.427
SAM: How's my penmanship?

00:51:47.427 --> 00:51:54.827
MATT: So far, so good. We'll see how it
progresses. As you guys exit the office, at the

00:51:54.827 --> 00:51:59.482
bottom of the stair, you can see that group that
was gathering earlier, with the young girl that was

00:51:59.482 --> 00:52:04.075
looking out towards the entryway, is there waiting
at the base of the stair.

00:52:04.075 --> 00:52:05.685
MARISHA: The bachelorette party?

00:52:05.685 --> 00:52:07.682
MATT: Yeah, the bachelorette party, if
you will.

00:52:07.739 --> 00:52:16.976
Though it was a mixed group. As soon as
you exit with Claudia, they notice her, notice

00:52:16.976 --> 00:52:23.366
you, and all step back for a moment and wait. As
you step down the stairs, a young half-elf girl,

00:52:23.366 --> 00:52:34.030
freckled, auburn hair, a smudged face of a hard
day's work, leans forward and goes, "Terribly

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:41.780
"sorry, Claudia. Are we good to use the cellar for
the meeting?" "Yes, of course. It is available to

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:46.283
"you right now. Not a problem." She goes, "All
right, thank you very much." She turns around and

00:52:46.283 --> 00:52:50.187
begins gathering up the crew. You can see a few
people at the bar, she's slowly gathering the folk

00:52:50.187 --> 00:52:54.575
until there's a cluster of about 20 or so. They
all begin making their way towards where the

00:52:54.575 --> 00:52:56.688
kitchen is into a pantry area.

00:52:56.688 --> 00:52:58.671
LAURA: Are they going to have an orgy?

00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:01.350
MATT: You're going to have to follow to find out.

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:02.968
LAURA: I'm asking that of Claudia.

00:53:02.968 --> 00:53:03.910
MATT: Oh.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:05.564
SAM: Out loud.

00:53:05.564 --> 00:53:14.032
MATT: She goes, "No, not so much. They are
passionate political debaters."

00:53:14.032 --> 00:53:15.792
LAURA: Oh.

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:20.623
MARISHA: Are you helping run some underground
clubs?

00:53:20.623 --> 00:53:22.514
TRAVIS: Just right out in the open, huh?

00:53:22.514 --> 00:53:23.866
MARISHA: In your cellar?

00:53:23.866 --> 00:53:29.973
MATT: "No, I am merely providing a space for
people that are wanting to work through some

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:33.134
"difficulties they have with their lifestyle. That
is all."

00:53:33.134 --> 00:53:35.273
LAURA: I'm running to find Caleb.

00:53:35.273 --> 00:53:41.551
LIAM: It's like latticework, you have to do the
smaller circle inside the larger.

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:43.491
SAM: You have to do this with every spell?

00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:45.016
LIAM: Each one's a little bit different.

00:53:45.016 --> 00:53:46.182
TALIESIN: (whispering) Caleb!

00:53:46.182 --> 00:53:47.780
SAM: We're busy here!

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.613
LIAM: We're really right in the middle of
something.

00:53:49.613 --> 00:53:51.283
TALIESIN: That's all right, we just need your
cat.

00:53:51.283 --> 00:53:53.853
MARISHA: I trail with Fjord! I want to know.

00:53:53.853 --> 00:53:56.378
TRAVIS: As we're heading down, I lean over to
Beau.

00:53:56.378 --> 00:53:58.166
LIAM: Frumpkin climbs up Molly's back.

00:53:58.166 --> 00:54:01.176
TALIESIN: I'm tossing Frumpkin in the direction of
that.

00:54:01.176 --> 00:54:03.713
LIAM: What are you doing with my cat?

00:54:03.713 --> 00:54:05.118
TALIESIN: In the basement!

00:54:05.118 --> 00:54:07.313
LAURA: Oh, you have to look through his eyes.

00:54:07.313 --> 00:54:08.981
SAM: You won't be able to see anything!

00:54:08.981 --> 00:54:11.115
TRAVIS: The two of us are going.

00:54:11.115 --> 00:54:15.361
LIAM: Go to the base-- look, the circle goes
inside the larger circle.

00:54:15.361 --> 00:54:18.211
SAM: What is the "a e" that's one letter?

00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:19.823
TRAVIS: I lean over to Beau and I say: I don't
know if you're aware of it, but when you

00:54:19.823 --> 00:54:24.903
compliment people it sounds like a fucking insult.
Is that intentional?

00:54:24.903 --> 00:54:27.819
MARISHA: What?

00:54:27.819 --> 00:54:32.687
TRAVIS: It was just an observation. Like
commenting on the office window? You've gotta put

00:54:32.687 --> 00:54:33.796
more smile--

00:54:33.796 --> 00:54:37.808
MARISHA: Oh, but that was badass! She had a cool
fucking office, I guess.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.421
TRAVIS: It didn't quite sound that way.

00:54:39.421 --> 00:54:40.401
MARISHA: Oh, no?

00:54:40.401 --> 00:54:42.641
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just something to put in your hat.

00:54:42.641 --> 00:54:44.518
LIAM: You know, maybe we pick this up later.

00:54:44.518 --> 00:54:45.647
MARISHA: Can I try it with you?

00:54:45.647 --> 00:54:46.612
TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it.

00:54:46.612 --> 00:54:49.275
SAM: I've just mastered the 'f' that looks like an
's'!

00:54:49.275 --> 00:54:51.063
MARISHA: You're really attractive.

00:54:51.063 --> 00:54:58.130
TRAVIS: Yeah, so let's start with maybe a little
smile on the face. That's always a good starting

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:00.221
point. Try again.

00:55:00.221 --> 00:55:02.151
MARISHA: You're really attractive.

00:55:02.151 --> 00:55:03.606
TRAVIS: Oh man, you look constipated.

00:55:03.606 --> 00:55:05.305
MARISHA: Is that worse somehow?

00:55:05.305 --> 00:55:07.850
TRAVIS: You ever winked at anybody?

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:12.237
MARISHA: You're really attractive.

00:55:12.237 --> 00:55:14.973
TRAVIS: We'll keep workshopping it.

00:55:14.973 --> 00:55:23.607
MARISHA: No? That still wasn't it? Fuck. Thank
you. At least thanks for telling me. Most people

00:55:23.607 --> 00:55:26.708
would just be like, "You're a bitch," and then
would leave.

00:55:26.708 --> 00:55:30.807
TRAVIS: I've been around you long enough that I
can tell you were actually trying to be nice.

00:55:30.807 --> 00:55:41.183
MARISHA: Thanks, man. I think you're real nice,
too. Genuine! I was being genuine!

00:55:41.183 --> 00:55:47.127
MATT: The two of you have wrapped up for the time
being.

00:55:47.127 --> 00:55:53.343
LAURA: I just wanted to borrow some parchment. Do
you have any extra pieces of paper, though?

00:55:53.343 --> 00:55:55.887
LIAM: How much do you need? For what?

00:55:55.887 --> 00:55:58.016
LAURA: I don't know. Like 20 pieces.

00:55:58.016 --> 00:56:00.004
SAM: Do you need to write a long letter?

00:56:00.004 --> 00:56:01.436
LAURA: A really long one.

00:56:01.436 --> 00:56:02.912
LIAM: I'll give you two.

00:56:02.912 --> 00:56:05.525
LAURA: I can make do with that, yes. Thank you.

00:56:05.525 --> 00:56:06.978
LIAM: I hand them over.

00:56:06.978 --> 00:56:10.294
TALIESIN: I need to know what your cat's
seeing. What's the cat seeing?

00:56:10.294 --> 00:56:11.997
LIAM: Hold on.

00:56:11.997 --> 00:56:13.280
SAM: Okay. I've got you.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.708
LAURA: I've got you, too.

00:56:14.708 --> 00:56:18.426
MATT: The cat, who's been following Fjord and
Beauregard, you guys have been having this

00:56:18.426 --> 00:56:23.999
conversation as you follow down to the cellar. As
you descend down the cellar stairs, you can hear

00:56:23.999 --> 00:56:31.769
conversation and a few voices passing. They all
get quiet. As you step and descend past where the

00:56:31.769 --> 00:56:38.225
ceiling of the basement reveals you, the group of
20 folks are all gathered around with a central

00:56:38.225 --> 00:56:48.292
podium on an elevated step or a box. They're all
looking at you, quiet. The one who's standing on

00:56:48.292 --> 00:56:57.627
the box is a human man probably in his early 60s
or so. Shorter hair, graying but a little unkempt

00:56:57.627 --> 00:57:04.937
in the face. He's got smaller spectacles at the
edge of his nose and unshaved stubble against his

00:57:04.937 --> 00:57:11.508
chin, but he's dressed in a nice, white shirt,
tucked in well, and looks thin and well-mannered.

00:57:11.508 --> 00:57:16.989
He puts his hand up and goes, "Hey there. Can we
help you?"

00:57:17.037 --> 00:57:20.799
LIAM: There's a bunch of people staring at Fjord
and Beauregard. Why are we doing this?

00:57:20.799 --> 00:57:22.244
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:57:22.244 --> 00:57:26.613
TRAVIS: Apologies. We don't mean to intrude. We're
new to this city. We just heard that some higher

00:57:26.613 --> 00:57:31.338
thinkers were going to be meeting down here. We
hoped we might be able to join you.

00:57:31.338 --> 00:57:34.050
MARISHA: Just looking for good conversation.

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:35.951
TALIESIN: They're making asses of themselves,
aren't they?

00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:41.988
MATT: Everyone looks at each other. There's an
ornery dwarf fella who looks over to the guy in

00:57:41.988 --> 00:57:49.889
the top and shakes his head. The half-elven girl
who was gathering the group gives a nudge toward

00:57:49.889 --> 00:57:59.998
you with a smile and says, "We can at least ask."
He goes, "All right, well, step on up." The crowd

00:57:59.998 --> 00:58:15.320
separates a little bit as you guys approach. "I'm
curious. Share with me briefly the joys the Empire

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.976
"has brought to your life."

00:58:17.016 --> 00:58:19.272
LIAM: I think it's like Alcoholics Anonymous
or something.

00:58:19.272 --> 00:58:23.611
MATT: "Be honest."

00:58:23.655 --> 00:58:28.462
TRAVIS: I'm afraid my list is not that long,
unfortunately.

00:58:28.462 --> 00:58:41.820
MARISHA: We're a bit skeptical. We're looking for
support, just like any other wayward souls in this

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.442
crazy town.

00:58:43.442 --> 00:58:45.012
TRAVIS: We seek knowledge.

00:58:45.012 --> 00:58:53.958
MARISHA: We want to be able to trust our Empire,
but maybe we need some reassurance in one way or another.

00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:57.373
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage with
his help.

00:58:57.373 --> 00:59:09.873
MARISHA: Persuasion with advantage? That's good! I
got a natural 18 with a plus one, so 19. Just

00:59:09.873 --> 00:59:12.087
being real vague.

00:59:12.087 --> 00:59:22.899
MATT: "You seem to be on the level. We are a group
called the Knights of Requital, and we are

00:59:22.899 --> 00:59:35.676
"discussing methods of changing the current
political unhappiness in the city of Zadash and beyond."

00:59:35.676 --> 00:59:45.661
MARISHA: See, we're not the only ones. We felt
like something's been missing.

00:59:45.661 --> 00:59:50.313
TRAVIS: Tearing at our heart. It's an ache.

00:59:50.313 --> 00:59:55.313
MATT: "Very well. I will continue with my talk, if
you don't mind."

00:59:55.313 --> 00:59:56.790
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Please, yes.

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:58.159
TRAVIS: Preach on.

00:59:58.159 --> 00:59:59.974
LIAM: Does that name mean anything to Caleb?

00:59:59.974 --> 01:00:07.785
MATT: No. Looking around the room, most of the
folks in here look to be salt-of-the-earth folk of

01:00:07.944 --> 01:00:14.904
the city. A few folks look to be a little more
wealthy, lower-to-middle class if you were to give

01:00:14.904 --> 01:00:24.765
any sort of comparison there, and they all look
like they're a bit riled up. The dwarf, who had

01:00:24.765 --> 01:00:32.700
eyed you up previously, his eyes have these heavy
bags under them, he's got this scraggly unkempt

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:39.713
brown beard, and very short, almost buzz-cut hair
on top. He's glaring at the two of you. He steps

01:00:39.713 --> 01:00:48.322
away from the crowd and keeps a very close eye.
The gentleman at the top, "First off, to our new

01:00:48.322 --> 01:01:00.562
"conversationalists, I am Dolan Thrym. As many of
you know her, I once ran a very successful physician

01:01:00.562 --> 01:01:13.671
"practice here in the Interstead Sprawl, one that
my partner was the head physician. Well, he was

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:23.401
"unfortunately brought to an unearned level of
shame, and his practice ruined, as well as our

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:33.646
"industry, by the house of Sutan naught but a year ago.
We went from a comfortable living helping people

01:01:33.646 --> 01:01:45.353
"to a life of squalor and shame. I know we're not
the only one, as now the son of the house of

01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:51.674
"Sutan, Ren, sits at the top of that practice. Took
all of our clients and squeezes them for all of

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:56.831
"their worth. And I, for one, am sick of it".
Everybody else in the group goes (grunt).

01:01:56.831 --> 01:01:58.256
MARISHA: (grunts)

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:09.112
MATT: "I'm sick of it and we can't sit back and
let nothing be done about it. Now, would you like

01:02:09.556 --> 01:02:14.098
"to take the floor, Ulog?" The dwarf who was
watching you guys takes his-- doesn't leave you

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:20.327
for a moment before he steps over and the crowd
separates and he steps up onto the small block

01:02:20.327 --> 01:02:31.224
which at his height puts him about head level with
most of the crowd. "As many of you know, I was a

01:02:31.224 --> 01:02:39.498
woodworker for many years, carving wood, did good
carpentry. My wife, Illiana, is a good wife.

01:02:43.253 --> 01:02:50.677
About six months ago, she was up late at night
picking up food for the night for the two of

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:57.977
us in the Pentamarket. She was in the wrong place
at the wrong time. There were some street bandits

01:02:57.977 --> 01:03:07.087
outside the Tri-Spires. They stabbed someone who
had run in, ran clean into my wife, just as the

01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:17.939
Crownsguard descended. She got looped in with
them, thrown in jail. I went and fought. There

01:03:17.939 --> 01:03:23.724
wasn't even a bit of a trial. The High-Rictor sent
her straight to the Umber Dungeon, sentenced her

01:03:23.724 --> 01:03:35.987
20 years for this business. It's been six months
now, I can't even see her. I'm sick of it, and I

01:03:35.987 --> 01:03:38.442
think it's time we did something." Everyone in the
crowd goes (grunts).

01:03:40.222 --> 01:03:43.126
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (grunt)

01:03:43.134 --> 01:03:47.911
MATT: This continues one after another,
individuals start coming up and talking about

01:03:48.323 --> 01:03:55.388
resharing stories for the newcomers. Things that
have come up recently that frustrate them. They

01:03:55.388 --> 01:04:04.445
begin throwing things around like instability
within the Starosta's capable hands to maintain a

01:04:04.445 --> 01:04:09.434
political structure in a city this large. They
begin to talk on anger and frustration with the

01:04:09.434 --> 01:04:15.957
lack of proper education for the masses, keeping
them unable to climb status and eke out of living

01:04:15.957 --> 01:04:19.737
and thus are forced into the military to die out
on the fields of Xhorhas. There have been

01:04:19.737 --> 01:04:26.468
discussions about frustration dealing with the
ever creeping power scale of what's called the

01:04:26.468 --> 01:04:33.129
Cerberus Assembly and influence that stretches
from Rexxentrum into the city itself. Eventually,

01:04:33.129 --> 01:04:40.118
it begins to rise into many voices clamoring out
in frustration and once again, Dolan, the softer

01:04:40.118 --> 01:04:44.118
gentleman at the beginning puts his hands up and
steps back and goes: "I know, I know. I know.

01:04:50.218 --> 01:04:56.952
But we're going to find a way. I have friends that
I've made, people that we're talking to and we

01:04:57.768 --> 01:05:06.693
have, hopefully, a new beginning soon, an
opportunity where I think we can have a voice in

01:05:06.693 --> 01:05:17.879
the politics here. I hope to have more for you
soon, in the meantime, try and keep your chin up.

01:05:18.699 --> 01:05:25.855
I know it's hard now, but I believe we'll have an
opportunity soon. Thank you. Thank you to Kara,

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:30.486
who has been helping set these meetings up."
Points over to the younger half-elf earlier and she nods

01:05:30.486 --> 01:05:37.250
and a few hands clap. "And to our new members--
I'm sorry, I didn't get your names."

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.430
MARISHA: Beau.

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:40.104
TRAVIS: Fjord.

01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:44.574
MATT: "Beau and Fjord, thank you for joining us
tonight. It goes without saying, please, if you

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:51.104
don't mind, we prefer to keep these conversations
personal. For obvious reasons."

01:05:51.807 --> 01:05:53.443
MARISHA: Absolutely.

01:05:53.443 --> 01:05:58.108
MATT: "If even the most misunderstood discontent
leads to unfortunate circumstances."

01:05:58.108 --> 01:06:00.726
TRAVIS: We understand. Thank you for sharing with
us.

01:06:00.726 --> 01:06:07.877
MARISHA: I know I, for one, have had my discontent
with the Empire, so it's good to hear we're not alone.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:15.374
MATT: "Of course. That's requital. I appreciate
your time. Rest well, we'll meet soon. Dismissed!"

01:06:15.374 --> 01:06:18.780
Everyone begins to scatter and make their way back
up to the tavern.

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:21.172
TRAVIS: We stay down.

01:06:21.172 --> 01:06:24.235
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to wait behind. Wait to
talk to Dolan?

01:06:24.235 --> 01:06:29.780
TRAVIS: Yeah. Really appreciate what you said.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:32.170
MARISHA: Yeah, thank you. So much.

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:36.574
MATT: "Yeah, of course. I understand that you
aren't from around here, so don't feel that you

01:06:36.574 --> 01:06:46.993
have to take too much of this to heart. Best we
can do to try and keep spirits up. I believe that

01:06:46.993 --> 01:06:51.491
we can find a way to exact some change real
soon."

01:06:51.491 --> 01:06:57.730
TRAVIS: It struck a chord. It mirrors a lot of
what we've seen since we've been here. Do you meet

01:06:57.730 --> 01:06:59.798
very often? I'd love to come back.

01:07:00.658 --> 01:07:05.685
MATT: "Well, we're scheduled to meet here in the
next two days or so. We're gearing up for a couple

01:07:05.685 --> 01:07:06.977
of important events."

01:07:06.977 --> 01:07:13.355
MARISHA: How often are the meetings that heated?
That seemed pretty intense.

01:07:13.355 --> 01:07:14.500
TRAVIS: Yeah, personal. Emotional.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:20.062
MATT: "It can vary. Anyway, I'm sorry. I really
should be going."

01:07:20.062 --> 01:07:22.950
MARISHA: Where abouts in town do you live?

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:25.543
MATT: "Oh, I live outside of the Apple Tree
Tutors."

01:07:28.463 --> 01:07:32.092
MARISHA: We'll probably be staying here the next
few days.

01:07:34.482 --> 01:07:37.817
TRAVIS: Yeah. We'll check in with-- what was her
name?

01:07:37.817 --> 01:07:40.914
MARISHA: It's Claudia.

01:07:40.914 --> 01:07:45.011
TRAVIS: Yeah. We'll check in with Claudia if
there's any other meetings. Again, appreciate you

01:07:45.011 --> 01:07:46.563
being so open.

01:07:47.443 --> 01:07:56.602
MATT: "Appreciate you being respectful and close
to your chest. Anyway." He steps past the two of

01:07:56.602 --> 01:08:01.539
you, puts the rest of his jacket on, and exits.
Now it's just the two of you there in the cellar below.

01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:02.580
TRAVIS: What's in the cellar?

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:09.165
SAM: You going to rob the place there?

01:08:09.165 --> 01:08:12.269
TRAVIS: I just want to know. Is it munitions? Is
it meat? Is it booze?

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.769
MARISHA: Wine? Is there good wine?

01:08:12.769 --> 01:08:21.821
MATT: There are large casks, large wooden barrels
and casks. This is where major ale storage is set,

01:08:21.821 --> 01:08:26.625
but none of them are tapped. It looks to be full
of crates that are still sealed; unopened.

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:29.819
MARISHA: Any good wines? That I would recognize?

01:08:29.819 --> 01:08:31.446
MATT: None of the wines are kept in this cellar.

01:08:31.446 --> 01:08:32.581
MARISHA: Okay.

01:08:32.581 --> 01:08:36.810
MATT: By the size of the place, you get the sense
there's probably more than one storage place here.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:40.226
LIAM: When you scroll your cursor over it, though,
the descriptions are all in red.

01:08:40.226 --> 01:08:42.003
MARISHA: Sure. Can't access that.

01:08:42.003 --> 01:08:45.745
TRAVIS: Talk about an underbelly. That was more
than I was expecting.

01:08:45.745 --> 01:08:50.737
MARISHA: Yeah, and I totally called Claudia on it
too, and she didn't even come forward. I'm like,

01:08:50.737 --> 01:08:53.132
you're running some shit! She's running some
shit.

01:08:53.132 --> 01:08:53.876
TRAVIS: Right upfront.

01:08:53.876 --> 01:09:01.030
MARISHA: Did you notice he said thanks for keeping
things close to your chest? Are we that transparent?

01:09:01.038 --> 01:09:06.609
TRAVIS: No. I mean, I would say the same thing if
I was taking such a chance with people I didn't

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:10.103
know, right? I think he's just trying to invest in
us a little.

01:09:10.103 --> 01:09:10.744
MARISHA: Right.

01:09:10.744 --> 01:09:11.338
TRAVIS: Seemed nice.

01:09:11.338 --> 01:09:14.738
LIAM: I tell Frumpkin to yowl between their legs.

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:15.728
MATT: (meowing)

01:09:15.728 --> 01:09:17.380
MARISHA: (yells)

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:19.503
TRAVIS: (suppressing a sneeze)

01:09:19.503 --> 01:09:22.493
MARISHA: I give Frumpkin the finger, hoping Caleb
will see.

01:09:22.493 --> 01:09:25.268
LIAM: I don't see it. I'm not looking through it.

01:09:25.268 --> 01:09:27.176
MARISHA: Now I'm just flicking off a cat.

01:09:27.176 --> 01:09:29.127
TALIESIN: You gave us the basics, though?

01:09:29.127 --> 01:09:29.627
LIAM: Yeah.

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:31.922
TRAVIS: Let's go back up. Fuck it.

01:09:31.922 --> 01:09:37.377
LAURA: I was spending my time cutting the
parchment up into even, little rectangles so I

01:09:37.377 --> 01:09:40.277
could make them into multiple pieces of paper.

01:09:40.287 --> 01:09:42.325
MATT: Easy enough to do.

01:09:43.405 --> 01:09:44.613
MARISHA: We go back.

01:09:45.513 --> 01:09:48.913
MATT: As you guys head up into the tavern to meet
up with the rest of your troop, you see they're all

01:09:48.913 --> 01:09:51.577
sitting around, handling their other business.
What are you guys up to?

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:56.670
TALIESIN: We were listening to the description of
this insanity.

01:09:56.670 --> 01:10:00.876
LIAM: I bamfed out of that probably two minutes
before it finished, so I didn't get the tail end,

01:10:00.876 --> 01:10:02.577
but I got the meat.

01:10:02.577 --> 01:10:05.508
MATT: You got the meat of it. You watched the
people that were in the meeting leave in small

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:08.258
groups. They're pacing their exits.

01:10:08.258 --> 01:10:11.448
TRAVIS: Jester, don't believe what you hear. It
was a huge orgy. Just naked parts everywhere.

01:10:11.448 --> 01:10:15.228
LAURA: I figured it was and Caleb was lying to us
the whole time.

01:10:15.228 --> 01:10:21.224
TRAVIS: I know. Maple syrup. They had little Tic
Tacs and all sorts of chocolate chips. Lollipops galore.

01:10:21.224 --> 01:10:27.665
LAURA: Usually, in orgies like that, they don't
let you stay unless (tongue clicking). You're part of it.

01:10:27.665 --> 01:10:30.199
LIAM: He's not sticky with maple syrup. He's
lying.

01:10:31.479 --> 01:10:32.501
TRAVIS: Tongue bath.

01:10:33.341 --> 01:10:35.221
LAURA: Eww. Nice.

01:10:38.491 --> 01:10:43.829
SAM: I think what we should do is take the names
and descriptions of all of those people and turn

01:10:43.829 --> 01:10:50.998
them in to the authorities for 50 gold a person.
We could make so much money and be heroes in this

01:10:50.998 --> 01:10:53.843
town as well! Just like we were in the last!

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:59.478
LIAM: Maybe not that, but quite frankly, those
people are reckless, telling you what they told you.

01:10:59.478 --> 01:11:03.192
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is. The only problem with that
would be we were in that meeting at well.

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.276
SAM: As spies!

01:11:04.676 --> 01:11:08.776
TALIESIN: Except that they told them their real
names. And where they're staying.

01:11:09.276 --> 01:11:15.003
LIAM: The authorities don't delineate between the
real McCoy and the passersby. Just like that man's

01:11:15.003 --> 01:11:16.257
story. The dwarf.

01:11:16.257 --> 01:11:20.593
TALIESIN: Groups of people are always idiots.
Never trust a group of people. I specifically used

01:11:21.257 --> 01:11:24.300
to gather people into groups to make them into
idiots. It's just what you do. You don't--

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.719
LAURA: So you did that to us!

01:11:25.719 --> 01:11:28.668
TALIESIN: That is <i>exactly</i> what I did! It's how I
met you. It's why I keep you around.

01:11:28.668 --> 01:11:30.596
MARISHA: You also traveled with a group of
people.

01:11:32.226 --> 01:11:34.798
TALIESIN: Yes, but we weren't a group of people.
We all hated each other.

01:11:34.798 --> 01:11:35.974
TRAVIS: It's a smaller group.

01:11:35.974 --> 01:11:37.805
LAURA: It's a pretty big group. There's nine of
us.

01:11:37.805 --> 01:11:39.380
MARISHA: Do you notice how often his logic falls
apart?

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.265
TALIESIN: You just told them your real name!

01:11:42.755 --> 01:11:45.030
MARISHA: No. I told them I'm <i>Beau</i>.

01:11:46.752 --> 01:11:52.237
SAM: You left out the -regard part! And you
mispronounced your name "Ford" when we all know

01:11:52.237 --> 01:11:53.492
it's Fjord!

01:11:53.492 --> 01:11:54.357
TRAVIS: That's right. Yeah.

01:11:55.217 --> 01:11:56.054
SAM: Clever!

01:11:56.054 --> 01:11:59.198
MARISHA: Yeah. there's a lot of people named Beau.
Right?

01:11:59.198 --> 01:12:03.622
LAURA: Are there? I've only met one other person named
Beau.

01:12:04.385 --> 01:12:05.401
TALIESIN: I've literally only met one other person
named Beau.

01:12:05.401 --> 01:12:08.672
TRAVIS: It's a good nickname. Beau. Beauregard.

01:12:08.672 --> 01:12:11.360
LAURA: I think his name was not the same Beau as
your Beau.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.399
TALIESIN: It was a different Beau.

01:12:12.399 --> 01:12:17.522
LAURA: It was a different Beau. I'm going to start
folding my little pieces of paper into little trifolds.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:21.188
MATT: All righty. What else are you guys doing?

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:24.973
TRAVIS: I think we're probably good to retire.

01:12:25.473 --> 01:12:29.122
LIAM: I'm going to turn in. I have a little bit
more homework to do before the end of the night.

01:12:29.122 --> 01:12:30.267
Good night. Thank you. Good night.

01:12:30.267 --> 01:12:34.745
TALIESIN: I'm eventually falling asleep, but
before that, I'm going to go take a fucking bath.

01:12:34.745 --> 01:12:40.722
There is a bathhouse. I'm going there. Anyone who
wants to come with me is welcome to do so.

01:12:40.722 --> 01:12:43.626
LAURA: Aww, I want a bath so bad, but it's so
late, Molly!

01:12:43.626 --> 01:12:44.698
TALIESIN: It's just a walk!

01:12:44.698 --> 01:12:47.198
LAURA: Is it even going to be open at night?

01:12:47.198 --> 01:12:48.766
TALIESIN: Is it going to be open at night?

01:12:48.766 --> 01:12:50.311
MATT: You can go and try and find out.

01:12:50.311 --> 01:12:52.441
TALIESIN: I'm going to go and try and find out. 
I'm going to and try and find out!

01:12:52.441 --> 01:12:55.476
LAURA: Okay. I have important work to do.

01:12:55.476 --> 01:12:57.467
SAM: I'll accompany you, just to make sure you
don't get killed.

01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:00.698
LAURA: I'll come with you too because I really
want a bath.

01:13:00.698 --> 01:13:06.671
MARISHA: I guess I stay behind with Fjord. We talk
about the crazy shit we just heard.

01:13:06.671 --> 01:13:08.128
TRAVIS: Yeah, because we're fucking spies!

01:13:08.128 --> 01:13:12.523
MARISHA: Fuck yeah, man! We'll break the system!
Put it in the ground!

01:13:12.523 --> 01:13:13.850
LAURA: It's folded like this.

01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:16.484
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Fuck the man!

01:13:16.484 --> 01:13:17.388
MATT: All righty.

01:13:17.388 --> 01:13:19.676
TALIESIN: I'm just happy with my company.

01:13:19.676 --> 01:13:21.798
MATT: Right. Now, the two of you make an
investigation check.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:22.764
TALIESIN: Three.

01:13:22.764 --> 01:13:24.105
MATT: That's right. She's coming as well.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.606
LAURA: Oh, that's really bad. It's because I'm
folding paper.

01:13:28.606 --> 01:13:31.556
SAM: 17. I'm specifically looking for stores.

01:13:31.556 --> 01:13:32.814
TALIESIN: 15.

01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:33.704
LAURA: Four!

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:43.572
MATT: You do manage to discover the location of
The Steam's Respite, but it is closed for the

01:13:43.572 --> 01:13:46.053
night. It is too late for its functionality.

01:13:46.053 --> 01:13:46.910
LAURA: Damn it!

01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:54.223
SAM: On the way, do we pass Packwearer's
Provisions or any of the other fine establishments

01:13:54.223 --> 01:13:55.514
you've told us about?

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:59.570
MATT: If you wander through the Pentamarket, which
you can go roundabout to do that.

01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:01.000
TALIESIN: That's not on the way, then.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:01.780
SAM: No. Just on the way.

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:08.289
MATT: On the way from where you are exiting there,
none of those, no. The Pentamarket is pretty much

01:14:08.289 --> 01:14:09.818
this cluster at the center of--

01:14:09.818 --> 01:14:12.008
SAM: Any shops at all, or is it just--?

01:14:12.008 --> 01:14:22.962
MATT: You would've come across more small food
establishments like small dumpling establishments.

01:14:22.962 --> 01:14:28.849
Nothing too crazy. It looks like most of the
stores that are on the outskirts would be simple

01:14:28.849 --> 01:14:39.678
glassware, the occasional basic blacksmiths for
putting horseshoes on and the construction of

01:14:39.678 --> 01:14:42.963
that, simple armor repairs for whoever needs it.

01:14:43.223 --> 01:14:44.332
SAM: Nothing fun.

01:14:44.332 --> 01:14:48.469
MATT: Nothing crazy. Most of the good stuff is in
the vicinity you've already been.

01:14:50.239 --> 01:14:54.606
TALIESIN: You know, Nott, I notice. I notice the
way that you eye things, on occasion.

01:14:55.736 --> 01:14:58.312
SAM: I'm not stealing anything right now!

01:14:58.312 --> 01:15:03.858
TALIESIN: Not right now and that's fine. And I
would hate to get in the way of any of your

01:15:03.858 --> 01:15:09.629
business. Your business is your business and I'm
perfectly fine with that. But it's good to

01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:14.971
remember that there are people who need what they
have. There are people who need every bit of what

01:15:14.971 --> 01:15:19.058
they have. And there are people who would be much
happier if they had a little less.

01:15:19.738 --> 01:15:21.404
SAM: How do I know which is which?

01:15:21.404 --> 01:15:27.745
TALIESIN: Well that's a skill worth developing.
That's a skill very much worth developing.

01:15:27.745 --> 01:15:31.744
LAURA: If the people look like you and Caleb, they
probably need it.

01:15:32.744 --> 01:15:40.401
TALIESIN: If they seem grumpy, or angry, and seem
overly concerned with an enormous amount of money

01:15:40.401 --> 01:15:45.556
that they happen to have, or using it to just be
mean or cruel to somebody, that's probably a sign

01:15:45.556 --> 01:15:49.908
that they'd just be much happier if they just knew
exactly who liked them and the only way you could

01:15:49.908 --> 01:15:54.660
ever really know if someone likes you is if you
don't have anything over them. And the easiest way

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.061
to get to that honesty is if you don't have
anything.

01:15:57.711 --> 01:16:00.016
SAM: So you're saying steal from grumpy people?

01:16:00.016 --> 01:16:00.715
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

01:16:00.715 --> 01:16:02.305
LAURA: Shitty people specifically.

01:16:02.305 --> 01:16:05.664
TALIESIN: Unless they're grumpy because they don't
have enough. Because if you're hungry, you get

01:16:05.664 --> 01:16:06.288
very angry.

01:16:06.288 --> 01:16:07.646
LAURA: I do, I do get really mad.

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:09.237
TALIESIN: You get so angry when you're hungry!

01:16:09.237 --> 01:16:09.802
LAURA: I know.

01:16:10.492 --> 01:16:12.414
SAM: Which kind of grumpy is Beau?

01:16:13.704 --> 01:16:18.346
TALIESIN: Beau has way too much. So you should
probably take some stuff from Beau. That's fair.

01:16:18.346 --> 01:16:21.346
(laughter)

01:16:22.446 --> 01:16:25.820
Beau really needs to know who likes her.

01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:28.284
TRAVIS: Beau knows grumpy.

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:31.225
(laughter)

01:16:31.225 --> 01:16:35.584
LAURA: Oh no! It makes sense when you're in that
shirt.

01:16:36.734 --> 01:16:38.758
MATT: It makes sense when you're over 30.

01:16:38.758 --> 01:16:42.357
(laughter)

01:16:43.727 --> 01:16:45.326
TRAVIS: Passive sports marketing campaign: check!

01:16:48.516 --> 01:16:52.993
MATT: All right. So you guys find your way back.
What about the rest of you guys, anything?

01:16:52.993 --> 01:16:57.271
LIAM: I am just finishing up the spell Unseen
Servant before I go to bed so that I will know it

01:16:57.271 --> 01:16:58.312
in the morning.

01:16:58.312 --> 01:16:59.532
MATT: Easily enough. You have it copied over
without issue.

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:00.757
LIAM: Yes. Yes!

01:17:00.757 --> 01:17:02.003
TALIESIN: I'm so excited about a long rest.

01:17:02.003 --> 01:17:08.511
LAURA: Before I go to sleep, I'm going to use my
little folded papers and make little pamphlets to

01:17:08.511 --> 01:17:13.699
the Traveler. So it's going to be like, "Have you
heard of our lord and savior, the Traveler?"

01:17:13.699 --> 01:17:16.504
TALIESIN: You're going to get us killed!

01:17:17.114 --> 01:17:22.238
LAURA: He sure is the coolest, everyone should
worship him, he's the best guy around.

01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:30.323
TALIESIN: You're making Tijuana bibles. You're
making Tijuana bibles for your religion. Is there

01:17:30.968 --> 01:17:34.888
going to be nudity and sex in these? Because then
it's basically a Tijuana bible. <i>Don't</i> Google

01:17:34.888 --> 01:17:35.916
Tijuana bible.

01:17:35.916 --> 01:17:41.929
LAURA: They're like this little, because I had to
make them out of only two sheets of--

01:17:41.929 --> 01:17:42.815
MATT: How many did you make?

01:17:42.815 --> 01:17:47.869
LAURA: Well, however many I could make out of two
sheets of parchment, so probably like eight or

01:17:47.869 --> 01:17:49.718
maybe ten.

01:17:49.718 --> 01:17:54.916
MATT: We'll say ten and a few that didn't quite--
you got halfway through and like (frustrated

01:17:54.916 --> 01:17:59.814
noise) tore it up. Okay cool. So the rest of you
guys, are you all resting for the evening?

01:17:59.814 --> 01:18:00.553
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:18:00.553 --> 01:18:06.518
MATT: All right. Night rest comes without issue.
You awake in the morning to the sound of an

01:18:06.518 --> 01:18:14.207
already muttering tavern floor below you. The
smell of food and whatever dried ale has been

01:18:14.207 --> 01:18:18.524
spilled into the room that you're currently
sleeping in. But the day is yours, the morning has

01:18:18.524 --> 01:18:20.420
arrived, you are welcome to do what you wish.

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:25.699
TRAVIS: Molly, do you need to pray over your
swords? I don't know how often--

01:18:26.315 --> 01:18:27.557
TALIESIN: Oh, I did it before you woke up.

01:18:27.557 --> 01:18:31.959
TRAVIS: Oh. Well next time, could you include me
in it? I don't know if maybe it would help me with

01:18:31.959 --> 01:18:32.810
my skills.

01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:35.144
TALIESIN: Sure. Happily.

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:36.025
TRAVIS: I appreciate that.

01:18:36.025 --> 01:18:37.534
TALIESIN: That would be no problem.

01:18:37.534 --> 01:18:38.710
MARISHA: Morning, Jester.

01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:41.113
LAURA: Beau! You know what we need to do today?

01:18:41.113 --> 01:18:41.701
MARISHA: What?

01:18:41.701 --> 01:18:46.915
LAURA: We need to go to the pillow place and go
get some money from my mom!

01:18:46.915 --> 01:18:49.328
MARISHA: Your-- okay, yeah.

01:18:49.328 --> 01:18:50.895
LIAM: How do you get money from your mom?

01:18:50.895 --> 01:18:52.508
LAURA: You're not with us in our room right now!

01:18:52.508 --> 01:18:54.084
LIAM: Oh, you didn't come downstairs? Okay.

01:18:54.084 --> 01:18:54.914
MARISHA: Are you--

01:18:54.914 --> 01:18:56.031
TRAVIS: Peeping tom!

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:58.383
LAURA: How does he do that?

01:18:58.383 --> 01:19:01.291
MARISHA: How do you know? How do you know that
it's going to be there?

01:19:01.291 --> 01:19:03.314
LAURA: Because I asked her for it.

01:19:03.314 --> 01:19:08.512
MARISHA: Okay, but asking isn't the same as
confirmation of receiving.

01:19:08.512 --> 01:19:13.594
LAURA: Yes, but it's my mom and of course she's
going to send me money! You're crazy.

01:19:13.594 --> 01:19:17.387
MARISHA: Yeah. Totally. Let's go. I'll go with
you.

01:19:17.387 --> 01:19:23.658
LAURA: It's called the Pillow Trove. We need to go
there. But we need to look very pretty, so before

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:26.313
that, I'm going to see if Molly wants to go get a
bath.

01:19:26.313 --> 01:19:29.692
MARISHA: Okay. We have to look pretty?

01:19:29.692 --> 01:19:32.539
LAURA: Yes, we have to be fancy for that place.

01:19:32.539 --> 01:19:36.992
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah.

01:19:36.992 --> 01:19:42.020
LAURA: We also need to go to the blacksmith, you
guys! As I'm coming down the stairs. We have so

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.079
many things to sell.

01:19:43.079 --> 01:19:43.680
MARISHA: We do.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.326
TALIESIN: Blacksmith's is filthy; we'll go there
first.

01:19:45.326 --> 01:19:46.919
LAURA: Good call.

01:19:46.919 --> 01:19:48.703
SAM: All right.

01:19:48.703 --> 01:19:50.489
MARISHA: We stumble downstairs.

01:19:50.489 --> 01:19:58.382
MATT: You get your food, your breakfast set. Let's
see here. We'll say for the two meals and the

01:19:58.382 --> 01:20:04.909
drinks, and the three rooms overnight. If you want
to keep track of the tab. Though you haven't paid

01:20:04.909 --> 01:20:07.173
it yet, necessarily, if you're staying for a
while.

01:20:07.173 --> 01:20:08.214
MARISHA: Under the Nein?

01:20:08.214 --> 01:20:14.749
MATT: Put you at--

01:20:14.749 --> 01:20:16.630
LAURA: Plus, we're good friends of Claudia's!

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:18.580
TRAVIS: He's the DM.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:26.145
MATT: I'll put you at, at the three rooms, food
and drink, at about six gold so far.

01:20:26.145 --> 01:20:28.067
TRAVIS: Okay, gotcha. Six gold.

01:20:28.067 --> 01:20:29.904
MATT: This isn't the nicer part of town.

01:20:29.904 --> 01:20:34.260
TRAVIS: So far. One gold each.

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:35.651
MATT: All right. So.

01:20:35.651 --> 01:20:39.554
LIAM: Is Claudia down in this room at the moment?

01:20:39.554 --> 01:20:47.414
MATT: At the moment, no. Looks like it is your
dragonborn friend and there's maybe six people in

01:20:47.414 --> 01:20:48.153
the room.

01:20:48.153 --> 01:20:50.465
TRAVIS: How did your homework go last night?

01:20:50.465 --> 01:20:54.304
LIAM: Very well. I am a step ahead of where I was
yesterday.

01:20:54.304 --> 01:20:56.239
TRAVIS: Hey, that's great! Nicely done.

01:20:56.239 --> 01:21:02.793
LIAM: (lip smacking) I walk over to this
dragonborn. Good morning to you.

01:21:02.793 --> 01:21:03.918
MATT: "Right, good morning."

01:21:03.918 --> 01:21:06.790
LIAM: Sorry, I know you are busy preparing for the
day.

01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:07.864
MATT: "That's all right."

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:13.276
LIAM: I hear there is a rather large library here
in this city. This is correct, <i>ja</i>?

01:21:13.276 --> 01:21:20.035
MATT: "There's probably a few places with
libraries. There's the Archive--"

01:21:20.035 --> 01:21:22.735
LIAM: That's the biggest one. The main one.

01:21:22.735 --> 01:21:26.631
MATT: "Yeah. There's also the Hall of Erudition.
I'm pretty sure they got libraries as well."

01:21:26.631 --> 01:21:28.154
LIAM: The Hall of Erudition?

01:21:28.154 --> 01:21:33.943
MATT: "Yeah, it's where the Soltryce
Academy's...academy...is here."

01:21:33.943 --> 01:21:42.740
LIAM: Oh good. Okay. The first place, though,
could you point me in the direction of it from here?

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:56.328
MATT: "Right, that would be, let's see, right
around-- Hmm." (singsong) Let me make sure I get

01:21:56.328 --> 01:22:07.135
this correct for internal consistency. Ah, that
would be in the Interstead Sprawl. If you consider

01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:13.727
the city's triangular shape, there's the pentagram
market off-center and a little bit to the west of

01:22:13.727 --> 01:22:18.703
it, and then there's the East and West
Outersteads, which are the outside cusp and the

01:22:18.703 --> 01:22:23.005
slums and the outside of the main wall; there's
the Tri-Spire, which is up north; then there's a

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:28.684
section, a quadrant over here, it's a military
section in this weird ring that surrounds and

01:22:28.684 --> 01:22:31.741
bisects them all around the Pentamarket. That's
the Interstead Sprawl.

01:22:31.741 --> 01:22:32.947
TRAVIS: That's the garrison area?

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:38.196
MATT: Yeah. Well, no, that's the more
middle-class, central connecting part that holds

01:22:38.196 --> 01:22:39.788
the rest of the city together.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.299
TRAVIS: Gotcha. Garrison's more east, you said.

01:22:41.299 --> 01:22:42.145
LIAM: Library is there?

01:22:42.145 --> 01:22:43.306
MATT: The library is there.

01:22:43.306 --> 01:22:44.688
LIAM: And it's to the east, you were saying?

01:22:44.688 --> 01:22:49.028
MATT: From where you are now, you guys are in the
Eastern Outersteads, it would be west. And he

01:22:49.028 --> 01:22:55.794
goes, "Actually (ugh), hold on just a second, I'll
get to your meal. Follow me." He comes out from

01:22:55.794 --> 01:23:01.071
behind the bar and slaps it up, and puts an arm
around your shoulder and leads you right

01:23:01.071 --> 01:23:04.168
immediately outside to the front of the tavern,
pushing you along.

01:23:04.168 --> 01:23:05.457
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> okay, I shrink inward.

01:23:06.487 --> 01:23:14.429
MATT: He goes, "You look over that rooftop there,
and you can see that-- " and you see this slowly

01:23:14.429 --> 01:23:26.715
tapering tower that then curves off at the very
top to be a very dome-like pinnacle. The stonework

01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:32.712
itself appears to be like a smooth concrete
looking texture just from this distance, and the

01:23:32.712 --> 01:23:39.991
way the morning sun is hitting it, half of it is
just bright and reflective and really intricate

01:23:39.991 --> 01:23:45.509
carving and various tiers along the towers. He
goes, "That there's the Archive. That's what

01:23:45.509 --> 01:23:47.990
you're looking for. So just look at that tower and
keep going."

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.859
LIAM: Thank you.

01:23:48.859 --> 01:23:49.773
MATT: "No worries."

01:23:49.773 --> 01:23:57.624
LIAM: Also, asking the DM, not this dragonborn,
but you had mentioned the Chastity's Nook. Caleb

01:23:57.624 --> 01:23:59.425
would remember if you said what area it's in?

01:23:59.425 --> 01:24:00.073
MATT: Tri-Spires.

01:24:00.073 --> 01:24:01.428
LIAM: Tri-Spires. Thank you. Got it.

01:24:01.428 --> 01:24:04.091
MARISHA: Get that smut, boy, get that smut.

01:24:04.091 --> 01:24:04.912
LIAM: Sure, sure.

01:24:05.472 --> 01:24:06.871
TRAVIS: Did you say, "Get that smut?"

01:24:06.871 --> 01:24:07.735
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:24:07.735 --> 01:24:08.804
LIAM: Was there any question?

01:24:08.804 --> 01:24:09.634
TRAVIS: Just making sure.

01:24:09.634 --> 01:24:14.137
LIAM: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. You're
very helpful.

01:24:14.137 --> 01:24:18.401
MATT: "No worries." He runs back and quickly gets
beneath-- there are now two people waiting for him

01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:21.959
to get back, and he gets back to pouring drinks
and getting food orders situated.

01:24:21.959 --> 01:24:24.784
TRAVIS: So we're going to the blacksmith. Then
we're getting Molly a bath.

01:24:24.784 --> 01:24:26.636
LAURA: And me and me and me.

01:24:26.636 --> 01:24:30.610
TRAVIS: And you. And then are we looking for job
postings? Like, maybe some work?

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.989
TALIESIN: You're welcome to take a look at the job
postings if you don't want to take a bath, but I'd

01:24:33.989 --> 01:24:35.778
highly recommend a bath. Baths are great.

01:24:36.478 --> 01:24:37.600
LAURA: They really are.

01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:40.537
TRAVIS: Is it like a fancy thing?

01:24:40.537 --> 01:24:42.303
TALIESIN: Yes. <i>Very</i> fancy.

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:44.601
TRAVIS: Is it expensive?

01:24:45.721 --> 01:24:47.713
TALIESIN: That entirely depends what you think
it's worth.

01:24:47.713 --> 01:24:49.034
TRAVIS: Are you doing this?

01:24:51.724 --> 01:24:53.856
MARISHA: Blacksmith first and we'll see, how about
that?

01:24:53.856 --> 01:24:54.537
TRAVIS: Yeah, fair enough.

01:24:54.537 --> 01:24:57.066
LAURA: Because we might make <i>so</i> much money from
the blacksmith.

01:24:57.066 --> 01:24:58.849
TRAVIS: That is true.

01:24:58.849 --> 01:25:01.246
LIAM: Nott! What do you want to do today?

01:25:01.246 --> 01:25:06.908
SAM: I want to steal something. I have the itch.
It's back.

01:25:06.908 --> 01:25:08.055
TRAVIS: The syphilis itch?

01:25:08.055 --> 01:25:09.247
LIAM: All right.

01:25:09.247 --> 01:25:11.612
SAM: <i>Extreme</i> syphilis!

01:25:12.492 --> 01:25:17.504
MARISHA: We met an ex-physician. Just...never
mind. Never mind.

01:25:17.504 --> 01:25:20.096
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, he could check you out. Give
your crotch the old once over.

01:25:20.096 --> 01:25:21.942
SAM: A <i>former</i> doctor?! Sign me up!

01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:25.271
(laughter)

01:25:26.701 --> 01:25:27.546
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:35.542
LIAM: You know, I'm sure we can facilitate that.
Let's maybe manage our expectations, not go for

01:25:35.542 --> 01:25:38.542
the plumpest plum on the bush.

01:25:38.542 --> 01:25:41.534
SAM: Don't worry, I'm only going for grumpy people
today.

01:25:41.534 --> 01:25:42.130
LIAM: Okay.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:43.865
TRAVIS: Amazing!

01:25:44.245 --> 01:25:45.668
TALIESIN: I'm so excited!

01:25:46.498 --> 01:25:48.057
LIAM: This was an idea you had?

01:25:48.057 --> 01:25:52.306
SAM: It was given to me by a wise weirdo.

01:25:54.236 --> 01:25:57.320
LIAM: Right. I'm not going to question it.

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.550
TALIESIN: It's not the first time I've been
called-- actually, no, it's <i>not</i> the first time

01:25:59.550 --> 01:26:02.273
I've been called that, that's fair. It's not
Molly, this is me.

01:26:02.744 --> 01:26:04.631
LIAM: Okay, thank you, okay.

01:26:04.631 --> 01:26:09.493
MATT: As you guys are making your way through the
East Outersteads towards the Pentamarket, you said

01:26:09.493 --> 01:26:10.653
you're going to the blacksmith?

01:26:10.653 --> 01:26:16.600
MARISHA: Yeah. To... the... Spark Hammer
Smithing!

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.197
(laughter)

01:26:20.197 --> 01:26:23.252
MARISHA: That worked <i>real</i> well!

01:26:23.252 --> 01:26:23.995
MATT: Yeah, it did.

01:26:23.995 --> 01:26:27.934
LIAM: She <i>is</i> the grumpy one! Pencil in the DM's
neck!

01:26:27.934 --> 01:26:33.492
MATT: As you're making your way there, one thing
that you do-- you hear a voice that's loudly

01:26:33.492 --> 01:26:38.174
talking that crosses you guys as you're walking
down the street. You can see a younger man in his

01:26:38.174 --> 01:26:46.185
early 20s or so; he has really thin, blondish
hair, and he's wearing a tabard that is the same

01:26:46.185 --> 01:26:50.037
colors as the Crownsguard, but other than that,
normal clothing.

01:26:50.037 --> 01:26:50.706
LAURA: What's a tabard?

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:54.559
MATT: A tabard is a piece of cloth that goes over
the front and back--

01:26:54.559 --> 01:26:55.135
LAURA: Okay.

01:26:55.135 --> 01:26:56.767
MARISHA: Like when you see like knights--

01:26:56.767 --> 01:26:58.073
LIAM: It's like Medieval Times.

01:26:58.073 --> 01:27:01.591
MARISHA: Yeah. "I'm going for the green knight!"
That.

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:07.703
MATT: He's shouting out-- you get very quick
instance: he's a town crier. As you come into

01:27:07.703 --> 01:27:10.723
Zadash, you can see this is probably how a lot of
news is disseminated amongst the populace here.

01:27:10.723 --> 01:27:12.001
MARISHA: Ooh, what's he saying?

01:27:12.001 --> 01:27:19.369
MATT: What you hear approaching is, (shouting) "--
a crownsguard and the King's grace! Attack on

01:27:19.369 --> 01:27:26.482
Alfield is ended! Terrible fiends responsible put
to the sword by a crownsguard and the King's grace!"

01:27:26.482 --> 01:27:28.670
SAM: Hey! We did that! That was us!

01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:32.857
MATT: "The attack on Alf--" He repeats it as he
continues down the street.

01:27:32.857 --> 01:27:33.758
LAURA: Aw, man!

01:27:33.758 --> 01:27:35.384
SAM: They stole our thunder!

01:27:36.454 --> 01:27:37.794
TALIESIN: But not our gold.

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:39.477
SAM and LAURA: That's true.

01:27:39.477 --> 01:27:40.368
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:27:40.368 --> 01:27:44.253
TRAVIS: Although, I mean, credit would help our,
you know, reputation.

01:27:44.253 --> 01:27:45.994
LAURA: Yeah! We could be famous!

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:48.014
TALIESIN: Why would you want to be famous?

01:27:48.014 --> 01:27:50.194
MARISHA: What do you expect from the Crownsguard,
though?

01:27:50.194 --> 01:27:51.433
LAURA: Have you ever been famous?

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:53.310
TALIESIN: No, I have no interest in becoming it,
thank you very much.

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:56.359
LAURA: You have <i>no</i> idea the kind of stuff that
is given to you when you're famous.

01:27:56.359 --> 01:27:59.020
TALIESIN: I have most everything I need already.
Why would I need more stuff?

01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:03.381
TRAVIS: Jester, any interest in chasing down that
guy and seeing where the news is gathered? Maybe

01:28:03.381 --> 01:28:05.092
they could print a retraction.

01:28:06.432 --> 01:28:08.331
LAURA: Want me to go tell him he's got it wrong?

01:28:09.241 --> 01:28:10.335
TRAVIS: Or where it comes from?

01:28:10.335 --> 01:28:11.598
LAURA: Okay I chase after him.

01:28:11.598 --> 01:28:12.071
TALIESIN: No!

01:28:12.071 --> 01:28:14.216
MARISHA: He's going to think you're crazy!

01:28:14.216 --> 01:28:18.106
LIAM: Also, I'm sorry, some of you wish to be in
the spotlight with the things that we do?

01:28:18.106 --> 01:28:20.000
LAURA: I chased after him already.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.488
MATT: Okay. He's moved onto-- it looks like he's
cycling through different pieces of news, and as

01:28:24.488 --> 01:28:30.721
you approach, he's shouting, "Families missing in
Nogvurot! Crick kidnappers steal them away in the

01:28:30.926 --> 01:28:37.880
night! Lock and seal your windows and doors while
you slumber! The attack on Alfield has ended!

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.803
Terrible--" and you approach him at that point.

01:28:41.703 --> 01:28:43.374
LAURA: Excuse me, town crier man?

01:28:44.484 --> 01:28:45.259
MATT: "Yeah?"

01:28:46.459 --> 01:28:48.377
LAURA: Where does your news come from?

01:28:50.487 --> 01:28:53.549
MATT: "From my boss."

01:28:53.549 --> 01:28:55.845
LAURA: Where is your boss located?

01:28:55.845 --> 01:28:57.699
MATT: "It's the King's Hall."

01:28:57.699 --> 01:29:04.112
LAURA: Because your boss at the King's Hall has
some of his news-- his news is <i>wrong.</i> Did you

01:29:04.112 --> 01:29:10.622
know that the attack on Alfield was defeated by a
group called the Mighty Nein? They're this really

01:29:10.622 --> 01:29:11.464
amazing band of heroes--

01:29:11.464 --> 01:29:12.593
MATT: "I was not aware. I did not know."

01:29:12.593 --> 01:29:13.249
LAURA: Yes--

01:29:13.249 --> 01:29:14.277
MATT: "That's really interesting."

01:29:14.277 --> 01:29:18.021
LAURA: Yes, it is, it's really cool. Because we
were there and we saw it happen and it was really

01:29:18.021 --> 01:29:20.287
cool and you should probably get your news
right--

01:29:20.287 --> 01:29:24.808
MATT: "That sounds amazing. You should go tell
that to the Herald of the Hall. He's probably the

01:29:24.808 --> 01:29:26.185
one who would care the most."

01:29:26.185 --> 01:29:30.614
LAURA: Okay, because by the time, though, that we
get there, and then it gets back to you, you've

01:29:30.614 --> 01:29:36.503
probably been around town so much, and then you'll
have to retract your article, and that would be

01:29:36.503 --> 01:29:37.236
really weird.

01:29:37.236 --> 01:29:42.183
MATT: (shouting) "The attack on Alfield--" and he
quickly gets away from you, repeating the process

01:29:42.183 --> 01:29:42.896
over and over again.

01:29:42.896 --> 01:29:48.546
LIAM: Also, Fjord walks right up behind Jester and
says: (deeper voice) Come on, we need to get back

01:29:48.546 --> 01:29:53.964
with the others. Okay? This is not a good idea to
put yourself out in the open, let's go.

01:29:53.964 --> 01:29:54.519
LAURA: Fjord?

01:29:54.519 --> 01:29:56.560
LIAM: (deeper voice) Yes, it's me, I'm Fjord. Come
on.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.760
LAURA: What is this? Is this a new accent you're
trying out?

01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:03.455
LIAM: There was a cough drop stuck in the side of
my mouth.

01:30:03.455 --> 01:30:04.769
MARISHA: Like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

01:30:05.689 --> 01:30:07.893
LAURA: Fjord, you almost sound like Caleb.

01:30:07.893 --> 01:30:09.467
LIAM: This is deep Texan, I don't know--

01:30:09.467 --> 01:30:13.225
LAURA: Are you planning on sounding like Caleb
now?

01:30:13.225 --> 01:30:16.316
LIAM: Listen, accents are not my strong suit.
Would you please just stop talking to the town

01:30:16.316 --> 01:30:19.731
crier? Thank you. I'm trying to drag her back.

01:30:19.731 --> 01:30:24.420
LAURA: What are you talking about? Accents are
your strong suit. You're really good at it, Fjord!

01:30:24.421 --> 01:30:25.621
TRAVIS: You look like me?

01:30:25.621 --> 01:30:27.286
MATT: You trying to drag her along?

01:30:27.286 --> 01:30:28.637
LIAM: Yeah, back towards the group.

01:30:28.637 --> 01:30:29.794
MATT: Do you let him drag you?

01:30:31.244 --> 01:30:34.393
LAURA: Yeah. Wait, can I tell it's not actually
him?

01:30:34.393 --> 01:30:35.387
LIAM: Probably.

01:30:35.387 --> 01:30:37.011
LAURA: Can I tell it's not Fjord?

01:30:38.471 --> 01:30:43.010
LIAM: It sounds about as good as I just did.
Caleb's not good at accents.

01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:44.057
TRAVIS: But Fjord does accents.

01:30:44.057 --> 01:30:53.554
LAURA: That's the thing. Can I tell from the
physicality? Because you do accents.

01:30:53.554 --> 01:30:54.889
MATT: That's interesting.

01:30:56.499 --> 01:30:58.079
LIAM: I am Fjord Tough, let's go.

01:31:00.439 --> 01:31:05.683
LAURA: Fjord, you seem even weaker than you were
before, pulling me along. This is weird.

01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:11.538
LIAM: But I don't smell bad. Now come on, let's go
to the rest of the group.

01:31:11.538 --> 01:31:16.271
LAURA: (gasps) Caleb? Is it really you?

01:31:16.271 --> 01:31:19.236
LIAM: I pull her by the earlobe. Can we please go
back to the rest?

01:31:19.236 --> 01:31:23.033
LAURA: Okay, just let go of my ear now, okay.

01:31:25.473 --> 01:31:32.440
LIAM: I'm sorry. Is this what we are going to be
about? Huge credit, and get ourselves to be part

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.300
of the news?

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:37.164
LAURA: Hey man, I was just doing what Fjord told
me to, okay? So don't you give me shit!

01:31:37.164 --> 01:31:42.249
LIAM: I am not giving you shit, I am putting a
subject on the table for the group. I need to make

01:31:42.249 --> 01:31:46.864
an informed decision about what Nott and I are
doing.

01:31:48.224 --> 01:31:49.863
TALIESIN: I prefer to keep it on the down-low,
personally.

01:31:49.863 --> 01:31:53.852
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course. Not to alarm you, I only
meant that if we are going to be paid for our

01:31:53.852 --> 01:32:00.342
escapades, a reputation, anonymously, might help,
if we belong to that name.

01:32:00.342 --> 01:32:02.587
MARISHA: You want an anonymous reputation?

01:32:02.587 --> 01:32:08.418
LAURA: Oh my gosh! This is perfect! Because if
we're called the Mighty Nein, people will expect

01:32:08.418 --> 01:32:10.528
it to be a different group of people.

01:32:10.528 --> 01:32:11.773
SAM: Because we're just six?

01:32:11.773 --> 01:32:15.684
LAURA: Yeah. That's actually brilliant.

01:32:17.214 --> 01:32:20.036
SAM: We're disguised! We're hiding in plain
sight!

01:32:23.226 --> 01:32:28.721
MATT: As you say that, across the way, you can see
there's one crotchety-looking dude with one eye

01:32:28.721 --> 01:32:29.257
who's like--

01:32:31.247 --> 01:32:32.748
TALIESIN: I'm going to look right back at him.

01:32:34.208 --> 01:32:35.765
MATT: Averts his gaze and keeps on walking.

01:32:37.225 --> 01:32:38.556
TALIESIN: Do I have something in my teeth?

01:32:40.486 --> 01:32:43.309
MARISHA: Plus, what makes you assume we're about
anything right now? I don't think we've made any

01:32:43.309 --> 01:32:46.890
decisions. I thought we were just having fun,
right? Making good money?

01:32:46.890 --> 01:32:48.287
TALIESIN: I'm here for making money.

01:32:48.287 --> 01:32:49.972
MARISHA: Are we about anything?

01:32:49.972 --> 01:32:50.779
TRAVIS: No.

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:54.705
MARISHA. Yeah. Do you want to be about something?

01:32:54.705 --> 01:32:58.090
LIAM: I don't want to be about making a stink
everywhere we go.

01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:00.490
TALIESIN: This is what happens after you go to
meetings, is suddenly you want to be about

01:33:00.490 --> 01:33:01.355
something. Be careful.

01:33:01.355 --> 01:33:03.636
TRAVIS: That's not true. Caleb, I'm sorry.

01:33:03.636 --> 01:33:04.975
MARISHA: I didn't say it, he did!

01:33:04.975 --> 01:33:07.486
TRAVIS: If we put you at unease, that was not our
intention.

01:33:07.486 --> 01:33:12.900
LIAM: It's not just me. You are vomiting salt
water, and you are getting into fistfights with

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:15.699
people, I don't know what you're doing. And you--
Look at you.

01:33:15.699 --> 01:33:17.281
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

01:33:18.501 --> 01:33:21.906
TRAVIS: "Look at you" is always the worst. Look at
you!

01:33:21.906 --> 01:33:26.916
TALIESIN: I'm well aware. This is entirely for the
sake of my mirror. I'm very well aware.

01:33:28.216 --> 01:33:34.263
MARISHA: We're the ones that you don't know?
What's going on with-- You two take off every day!

01:33:34.263 --> 01:33:41.034
The two of you! Maybe you would know what we're up
to if you went along with the group once!

01:33:42.214 --> 01:33:43.234
LIAM: Go along with the group?

01:33:43.234 --> 01:33:47.445
LAURA: He always knows what we're up to because he
has his cat follow us.

01:33:47.445 --> 01:33:48.088
LIAM: Yeah.

01:33:48.088 --> 01:33:50.743
MARISHA: Yeah, super personable.

01:33:50.743 --> 01:33:56.045
LIAM: I have fought a giant toad creature with
you. I have fought a big lion thing with a woman's face.

01:33:56.056 --> 01:33:57.512
TALIESIN: I propose a plan.

01:33:57.512 --> 01:33:58.528
LAURA: You killed its baby!

01:33:58.528 --> 01:34:01.432
SAM: I did. I feel very bad about that.

01:34:01.432 --> 01:34:06.918
TALIESIN: I have a plan for this. I have a plan,
we're going to take our scrap and we're going to

01:34:06.918 --> 01:34:11.520
sell it, so that we have some money. We're going
to take the good feelings from that money and

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:15.702
we're going to spend it on hot water and
inappropriate, friendly nudity.

01:34:15.702 --> 01:34:16.687
LAURA: Yeah!

01:34:16.687 --> 01:34:23.104
TALIESIN: And we're going to have a discussion
about what we're doing, with heat, steam, water

01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:24.778
and a little bit of cash.

01:34:25.168 --> 01:34:28.267
MARISHA: Okay, you're super insistent about this,
so I'm going to go with it.

01:34:28.267 --> 01:34:29.644
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm down for it, too.

01:34:29.644 --> 01:34:32.210
MARISHA: Because now I feel like it's real
important to you.

01:34:32.210 --> 01:34:35.212
TALIESIN: I just find it's easier to have this
conversation when everyone is sitting around naked

01:34:35.212 --> 01:34:35.949
in hot water.

01:34:35.949 --> 01:34:39.923
TRAVIS: Molly, I expect you to lead this escapade.
Please, lead on.

01:34:39.923 --> 01:34:42.909
MARISHA: Sherpa us to our first bathhouse
experience.

01:34:42.909 --> 01:34:44.798
TALIESIN: I take five steps and then I go, I don't
know where the blacksmith is.

01:34:44.798 --> 01:34:45.833
LAURA: I'll lead the way!

01:34:45.833 --> 01:34:50.113
TRAVIS: Five steps in a circle.

01:34:50.113 --> 01:34:59.025
LIAM: As everybody walks, to Beau I say: Listen
it's just about logistics. I mean you are very--

01:34:59.025 --> 01:34:59.978
TRAVIS: Do you still look like me?

01:34:59.978 --> 01:35:05.011
LIAM: No, I dropped it. You are in peak physical
condition, your guns are amazing. I can't do

01:35:05.471 --> 01:35:09.760
what you do. I can't run into it, of course. I'm
100 yards back, because I'm thin as a wet toilet paper.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:11.746
MARISHA: Thanks man, thanks.

01:35:12.332 --> 01:35:13.536
LAURA: Thin as a wet toilet paper?

01:35:13.536 --> 01:35:22.042
MARISHA: I'm sorry, were you trying to tell me
about-- I'm sorry, what? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:22.042 --> 01:35:28.213
LIAM: I've got to stop complimenting you, it does
not lead to good moments. I walk away.

01:35:28.213 --> 01:35:34.858
MARISHA: Okay wait! Damn it! First time Liam's
walked away from me in the campaign!

01:35:34.858 --> 01:35:42.544
MATT: Following Jester, you make your way back to
the Pentamarket, to the outside of the Spark

01:35:42.544 --> 01:35:47.160
Hammer Smithing. What was previously closed the
night before, you can now see the open air smithy

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:55.084
is lively and banging. You can hear the slamming
of hammer on metal and the shower of sparks from

01:35:55.084 --> 01:36:05.962
the exterior anvil setup. Currently out there is a
halfling man with deeply tanned, red skin, short,

01:36:05.962 --> 01:36:15.000
black hair and very muscular arms, who currently
has leather gloves on, leather apron, and is in

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.154
the process of forging some kind of long metal
blade, hammering it out over a heavy anvil on the

01:36:21.154 --> 01:36:30.418
outside. There is the trough for the quenching of
the blade and then in the interior you can see, a

01:36:30.418 --> 01:36:37.082
few steps away, the orange glow of the rest of the
blacksmith interior. There looks to be somebody

01:36:37.082 --> 01:36:42.370
else on the inside but you don't get a view of
them right now. You can just barely get rows and

01:36:42.370 --> 01:36:46.208
rows and racks of various pieces of armor and
weapons that are currently hanging on display on

01:36:46.208 --> 01:36:50.007
the inside. There is nobody in the process of
walking through at the moment, just in the process

01:36:50.007 --> 01:36:57.472
of crafting, so you are the only individuals who
are holding the space at the moment. So the (metal

01:36:57.472 --> 01:37:02.133
clanging), turn, (metal clanging).

01:37:02.133 --> 01:37:05.455
LAURA: I take my pink bag and I put it down on the
table in front of him.

01:37:05.455 --> 01:37:10.778
MATT: (Metal clanging "Hello?"

01:37:10.778 --> 01:37:14.274
LAURA: Hi! We have things to buy and sell from
you.

01:37:14.274 --> 01:37:20.469
MATT: "Well, I'm all certainly here for that. What
you got? What you looking to buy?"

01:37:20.469 --> 01:37:26.380
LAURA: I pull out-- Well it depends, do you have a
hand axe that I could buy?

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:36.902
MATT: He sets the hammer into the water, the steam
rises up, quenches the blade, takes the gloves off

01:37:36.902 --> 01:37:47.298
and wipes heavy sweat from the brow. "You're
looking for a--?"

01:37:47.298 --> 01:37:51.280
LAURA: Hand axe! Something that is very sharp and
can kill people!

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:58.531
MATT: "That I can do." Turns around to the inside
of the building and comes back. He has two hand

01:37:58.531 --> 01:38:02.382
axes, both look pretty well made, one looks a
little more intricate than the other, but both are

01:38:02.382 --> 01:38:07.860
pretty solid. "So we got these two." Throws one
and catches it, throws the other and catches it.

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:15.948
LAURA: Okay, put those on the table and then we
will look at some other stuff first. Okay! I have

01:38:15.948 --> 01:38:24.234
six short swords, and I put them down on the
table. I've got two daggers here! I've got two

01:38:24.234 --> 01:38:29.219
hand crossbows! Two light crossbows and two heavy
crossbows!

01:38:29.219 --> 01:38:36.986
MATT: You place them all down and looking at the
quality and the shininess and the smooth, fresh

01:38:36.986 --> 01:38:46.933
weaponry that he's placed on the table and the
pockmarked, used, damaged, in some cases gnoll

01:38:46.933 --> 01:38:51.918
mess covered weaponry, you immediately realize--
oh.

01:38:51.918 --> 01:38:54.335
LAURA: Maybe scrap metal is a good thing for this.

01:38:54.335 --> 01:39:02.400
MATT: "I say so, these have all seen some use. Not
all that great. Sorry."

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.315
LAURA: But also! Also, we have some other things!

01:39:05.315 --> 01:39:13.649
MARISHA: There were then chains, the manacles.
Cart, we definitely drug here. Definitely around

01:39:13.649 --> 01:39:14.357
Fjord's neck.

01:39:14.357 --> 01:39:15.386
SAM: We're selling these things?

01:39:15.386 --> 01:39:16.589
TRAVIS: Are they in the bag?

01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:17.544
LAURA: I have them!

01:39:17.544 --> 01:39:18.711
MARISHA: Oh, were they in the bag?

01:39:18.711 --> 01:39:20.933
LAURA: We put everything in the bag, then it would
be good.

01:39:20.933 --> 01:39:25.947
MATT: You couldn't fit the manacles in the bag.
The one that was around the neck of the manticore.

01:39:25.973 --> 01:39:27.764
LAURA: Then we fucking had them around our necks.

01:39:28.513 --> 01:39:30.537
MATT: Yeah, you had them in the cart. So you bring
them along with you.

01:39:30.537 --> 01:39:32.170
LAURA: We knew we were going to the blacksmith.

01:39:32.170 --> 01:39:35.711
MATT: "Well these here, these are some nice
metal."

01:39:35.711 --> 01:39:37.592
LAURA: And they were magic!

01:39:37.592 --> 01:39:39.709
MATT: "They were magic."

01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:41.348
MARISHA: I show him the rune.

01:39:41.348 --> 01:39:43.835
LAURA: They had to be real good metal to be magic!

01:39:43.835 --> 01:39:48.407
MATT: "Let me have a look at that." He takes them,
pulls on the chains, drags for a minute and he

01:39:48.407 --> 01:39:52.831
inspects them over. "This some real nice
craftsmanship, you don't see something this well

01:39:52.831 --> 01:39:56.802
made. So where did you get this?"

01:39:56.802 --> 01:40:03.413
LAURA: This giant lion thing with a woman's head
had them around it and then we killed the lion

01:40:03.413 --> 01:40:04.344
thing.

01:40:04.344 --> 01:40:05.924
SAM: We found it.

01:40:05.924 --> 01:40:08.977
MATT: Did you guys bring the cart with you?

01:40:08.977 --> 01:40:13.038
TALIESIN: Well, if we got there then yeah,
probably.

01:40:13.038 --> 01:40:20.647
MATT: He glances past you. Well, the manticore
head is still affixed to the cart, by the way. The

01:40:20.647 --> 01:40:28.374
halfling looks past and he goes, "I'll take it you
mean that thing. It's quite scary, well done. Ah,

01:40:28.374 --> 01:40:36.118
looking at all the weapons. The wood's mostly
rotted, unfortunately. Some of the metal can be

01:40:36.118 --> 01:40:44.264
melted down and reused, have to hammer out all of
the imperfections, smelt it all. The manacles look

01:40:44.264 --> 01:40:52.350
very nice. Tell you what. Give me the lot and the
manacles, I'll give you both these axes and be in

01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:54.873
excess of about 20 gold pieces."

01:40:54.873 --> 01:40:57.886
LAURA: Do we want both of the axes or just the
one?

01:40:57.886 --> 01:40:59.235
SAM: Why do we need any axes?

01:40:59.235 --> 01:41:05.042
LAURA: I need another weapon. Just one of the axes
is all I need. I don't need both.

01:41:05.042 --> 01:41:09.044
MATT: "Put that at about 25 gold then, and the one
axe."

01:41:09.044 --> 01:41:10.435
LAURA: Sound good for you guys?

01:41:10.435 --> 01:41:11.608
TALIESIN: Works for me.

01:41:11.608 --> 01:41:12.473
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:41:12.473 --> 01:41:16.084
LAURA: I like it. I think that is a very good
deal. What's your name, sir?

01:41:16.084 --> 01:41:19.426
MATT: "Sorry about that. Yannick. Yannick Dumel.

01:41:19.426 --> 01:41:25.320
LAURA: Yannick. I'm Jester. It's nice to meet you.

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:31.717
MATT: "Nice to meet you as well, Jester. Inside
there is Jan. She helps run the place. Fantastic.

01:41:31.717 --> 01:41:33.143
I'll go get your gold for you."

01:41:33.143 --> 01:41:35.458
SAM: Do you sell flasks?

01:41:35.458 --> 01:41:41.250
MATT: "I do not work in smaller bits of metal,
unfortunately. More the hefty kind. My apologies.

01:41:41.250 --> 01:41:45.722
If you're looking for flasks--" Takes a moment and
thinks of something. "There's Wares &amp; Ends.

01:41:45.722 --> 01:41:48.849
They've probably got something there for you.
There's Packwearer's Provisions, they probably got

01:41:48.849 --> 01:41:54.815
flasks around there. Well, they probably have some
at the Lodge of the Eclipse, that's possible."

01:41:54.815 --> 01:41:56.127
TRAVIS: Lodge of the Eclipse?

01:41:56.127 --> 01:42:02.811
MATT: "Right, right. That's the more hoity-toity
night time tavern here in the Pentamarket."

01:42:02.811 --> 01:42:04.896
TALIESIN: Why is it called Lodge of the Eclipse?

01:42:04.896 --> 01:42:07.537
MATT: "Because at nighttime they has the great
shows on stage."

01:42:07.537 --> 01:42:15.826
MARISHA: You know anyone that might want a scary
lion head thing to decorate their walls?

01:42:15.826 --> 01:42:18.622
LAURA: Specifically one that's melting.

01:42:18.622 --> 01:42:21.993
TALIESIN: Is there is a taxidermist, is what I
think she's asking.

01:42:21.993 --> 01:42:26.444
MATT: "I don't know about a taxidermist,
unfortunately. I'm pretty sure if you ask around

01:42:26.444 --> 01:42:33.496
you can find someone willing to pay for that. I
probably ask the Hall of Erudition, they deal in

01:42:33.496 --> 01:42:39.284
weird things and strange beasties. Sorry about
that."

01:42:39.284 --> 01:42:42.352
MARISHA: What did you say the fancy tavern was?

01:42:42.352 --> 01:42:43.460
MATT: "Lodge of the Eclipse."

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.447
MARISHA: Lodge of the Eclipse.

01:42:45.447 --> 01:42:49.316
LIAM: We might be able to take it to a school or a
medical facility to sell. Studies.

01:42:49.316 --> 01:42:53.609
LAURA: Yeah.

01:42:53.609 --> 01:42:55.682
TRAVIS: I'm good.

01:42:55.682 --> 01:42:56.859
SAM: Let's go.

01:42:56.859 --> 01:43:02.134
MATT: All right. You guys head on towards where
now?

01:43:02.134 --> 01:43:02.855
LAURA: The bath!

01:43:02.855 --> 01:43:07.101
LIAM: We're in the pentagram, penta--

01:43:07.101 --> 01:43:07.772
MATT: Pentamarket.

01:43:07.772 --> 01:43:12.246
LIAM: So we're close to the library? I thought it
was in that area.

01:43:12.246 --> 01:43:21.306
MATT: No, the library is-- the Archive you're
talking about. It's in the western side of the Pentamarket.

01:43:21.851 --> 01:43:27.083
LIAM: Okay, so we're closer now then we were. I
don't see the entrance from where we are, or do we?

01:43:27.633 --> 01:43:32.178
MATT: No, it's not one of the tallest towers in
the city. In fact, the Tri-Spires, as it's called,

01:43:32.178 --> 01:43:35.944
has three massive towers of all different designs
that lord over the rest of the city. They're the

01:43:35.944 --> 01:43:41.219
first things you saw when you crested the hill on
the way into the city the night before. This one

01:43:41.219 --> 01:43:45.616
is still visible from your perspective, though.
It's a little more squat and maybe four or five

01:43:45.616 --> 01:43:46.242
stories tall.

01:43:46.242 --> 01:43:48.703
LIAM: The whole kit and caboodle is visible from
here?

01:43:48.703 --> 01:43:52.781
MATT: Well, you can see where the Archive is but
it's maybe another ten minute walk to get there.

01:43:53.304 --> 01:44:00.317
LIAM: Okay. Does anyone mind if we swing by and
just take a look at the Archive? Not go in, you

01:44:00.317 --> 01:44:02.754
know, we have other things we're going to do, but
just to take a look.

01:44:02.754 --> 01:44:04.464
TRAVIS: At the outside?

01:44:04.464 --> 01:44:06.665
MARISHA: It's a bit of a tourist trap, but sure.

01:44:06.665 --> 01:44:08.236
LIAM: You have seen it before?

01:44:08.236 --> 01:44:10.652
MARISHA: Yeah, I lived here for like a short time,
passed through.

01:44:10.652 --> 01:44:13.396
LIAM: Okay, how long did you do that?

01:44:13.396 --> 01:44:13.850
MARISHA: A few months.

01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:16.665
LIAM: Okay. Well, I am a tourist.

01:44:16.665 --> 01:44:18.113
MARISHA: Yeah, it's pretty.

01:44:20.203 --> 01:44:21.386
TRAVIS: If it's on the way sure.

01:44:21.386 --> 01:44:22.300
LIAM: Okay.

01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:25.613
TALIESIN: Is the board between here and there? The
job board.

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:28.507
TRAVIS: Oh, the postings, yeah. What was it?

01:44:28.507 --> 01:44:29.838
SAM: The King's Hall.

01:44:29.838 --> 01:44:37.167
TRAVIS: The King's Hall. Where the Herald of the
Hall is. Where we can get that retraction.

01:44:37.167 --> 01:44:41.867
MATT: The King's Hall is actually not that far
from the Archive. It would be a brief detour to

01:44:41.867 --> 01:44:42.425
get there.

01:44:42.425 --> 01:44:46.650
TALIESIN: We can do a couple to the Archive,
couple to the King's Hall. Just pick it up.

01:44:46.650 --> 01:44:48.334
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's cool.

01:44:48.334 --> 01:44:51.312
LIAM: Would you like to show me the Archive? Not the
inside, the outside.

01:44:53.682 --> 01:44:55.747
MARISHA: I think it's this direction, if I
remember.

01:44:55.747 --> 01:44:59.888
LIAM: Never mind, I don't want to put you out.
Anyone want to go see the Archive?

01:44:59.888 --> 01:45:01.621
TRAVIS: Enthusiasm, Beau, <i>enthusiasm</i>.

01:45:01.621 --> 01:45:02.673
MARISHA: Aww, fuck.

01:45:02.673 --> 01:45:05.472
TRAVIS: Come on, work on what we did, come on.

01:45:05.472 --> 01:45:06.593
MARISHA: I don't think Caleb likes me.

01:45:06.593 --> 01:45:07.577
TRAVIS: Just try, give it a whirl.

01:45:07.577 --> 01:45:08.101
MARISHA: All right.

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:10.077
SAM: It would be great if you could both take
me!

01:45:12.217 --> 01:45:14.334
MARISHA: All right. Hey, Caleb!

01:45:14.334 --> 01:45:14.748
LIAM: Yeah?

01:45:16.238 --> 01:45:17.081
MARISHA: Right this way!

01:45:18.691 --> 01:45:19.556
LAURA: She's really scary.

01:45:19.556 --> 01:45:20.406
TRAVIS: (whispering) Yeah!

01:45:20.406 --> 01:45:23.626
MARISHA: Is that-- <i>fuck</i>. Was that all right?
Fuck.

01:45:23.626 --> 01:45:26.536
LIAM: It's just a volume thing sometimes. Okay
let's go look--

01:45:26.536 --> 01:45:27.947
MARISHA: (louder) He said enthusiasm!

01:45:27.947 --> 01:45:28.574
LIAM: Oh jeez!

01:45:28.574 --> 01:45:31.296
MARISHA: Was that not...? Let's go this way.

01:45:31.296 --> 01:45:31.896
TRAVIS: Baby steps.

01:45:31.896 --> 01:45:33.667
MATT: All right, so where are you heading first?

01:45:34.497 --> 01:45:35.141
LIAM: The Archive.

01:45:35.141 --> 01:45:39.369
MATT: The Archive, okay. On the way another town
crier crosses by; another individual, same garb, a

01:45:39.369 --> 01:45:51.108
middle aged woman, hair pulled back into a very
tight bun with the tufts of curled hair around the

01:45:51.108 --> 01:45:58.399
edges. Same tabard in the front and she's shouting
out, "Riot in Rexxentrum squashed for peace!

01:45:58.399 --> 01:46:01.865
Radical groups brought to justice under the
crown!"

01:46:01.865 --> 01:46:03.196
MARISHA: Ooh!

01:46:03.196 --> 01:46:04.167
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:46:04.167 --> 01:46:06.893
MARISHA: Ooh, that's some dirty fucking shit.

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:12.277
LAURA: I follow behind her and yell: Town crier
has toilet paper stuck to her shoe!

01:46:12.277 --> 01:46:15.619
(laughter)

01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:19.237
MATT: In the middle of her next line, "Two weeks
to--"

01:46:23.237 --> 01:46:25.203
LIAM: So you do know what toilet paper is.

01:46:28.243 --> 01:46:32.629
MATT: "Two weeks' time to the Harvest Close
Festival! Victory Pit in the Pentamarket, entry

01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:34.561
begins in four days!"

01:46:34.561 --> 01:46:37.030
LAURA: Wait, what did she just say?

01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.793
MARISHA: Harvest Festival?

01:46:37.793 --> 01:46:39.806
MATT: Harvest <i>Close</i> Festival.

01:46:39.806 --> 01:46:41.909
MARISHA: Harvest <i>Close</i>.

01:46:41.909 --> 01:46:44.324
MATT: Harvest Close. It's the end of the harvest.

01:46:44.324 --> 01:46:45.592
MARISHA: It's in two weeks?

01:46:45.592 --> 01:46:47.147
MATT: In two weeks.

01:46:47.147 --> 01:46:48.874
MARISHA: In a fortnight.

01:46:48.874 --> 01:46:52.469
MATT: In the Victory Pit in the Pentamarket. Entry
begins in four days.

01:46:52.469 --> 01:46:54.388
MARISHA: Victory Pit!

01:46:54.388 --> 01:46:57.578
LAURA: We need to get a really big piece of
vegetable.

01:46:57.578 --> 01:47:01.552
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah! Big pumpkins.

01:47:04.212 --> 01:47:09.109
MATT: You eventually find your way to the outside
of the Archive. Where you had seen was the

01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:15.497
tapering tower that had the dome, with the
polished sun reflection on one side, the rest of

01:47:15.497 --> 01:47:19.783
it you can see with the intricate carvings that
happen with each bit of the spiral as it continues

01:47:19.783 --> 01:47:26.182
downward. You can see three specific smaller
spires that from this perspective make it look

01:47:26.182 --> 01:47:35.561
like, I would say, almost like a TIE fighter on
its side. It has a series of smaller three spires

01:47:35.561 --> 01:47:40.173
at the base and a central spire that is the
mainstay of the library. You can see there's a

01:47:40.173 --> 01:47:47.710
double door at the base and a number of
individuals dressed in deep grey robes with blue

01:47:47.710 --> 01:48:01.142
sashes, very gray and blue color scheme. As you
approach, the outside of it you can see folks

01:48:01.142 --> 01:48:10.440
entering in and out but as they enter and exit the
facility they usually enter and exit under the

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.986
watch and being escorted by one of these
individuals that seem to be members of the Archive.

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:13.869
LIAM: Okay.

01:48:13.869 --> 01:48:15.223
TRAVIS: Sure is pretty.

01:48:17.723 --> 01:48:20.584
LIAM: I would just like to look around. It's in a
square, you say?

01:48:20.584 --> 01:48:25.742
MATT: It's built off of one of the main roads that
leads in the direction of where the King's Hall

01:48:25.742 --> 01:48:30.222
is. So it's not in a major square area, but it's
off a large road.

01:48:30.222 --> 01:48:35.577
LIAM: Yeah? Well I am no super spy, but I would
like to just look at the area and see what I see

01:48:35.577 --> 01:48:41.581
in the nature of security, other than these
obvious robed figures.

01:48:43.681 --> 01:48:50.348
MATT: All the windows that exist are at least
eight feet off the floor and look to be a very

01:48:50.348 --> 01:48:59.093
thick stained glass. The only entrances you see
are currently guarded by at least two members of

01:48:59.093 --> 01:49:04.974
the Archive and the dress of them actually is very
close to the individual that helped in the trial

01:49:04.974 --> 01:49:12.265
that you had in Trostenwald who introduced himself
as Zeenoth, the one who helped provide information

01:49:12.265 --> 01:49:17.662
that eventually got you off the hook for that
trial. You can now see similarities in the color

01:49:17.662 --> 01:49:22.827
scheme of their attire and the way that it's worn.
It's ceremonial. It looks like it comes with a

01:49:22.827 --> 01:49:34.141
ceremonial robe. They're all uniform to a certain
extent with some being more intricate and longer

01:49:34.141 --> 01:49:37.577
with more jewelry and they seem to have a little
more station.

01:49:37.577 --> 01:49:40.428
LIAM: And you said everyone going in and out was
being escorted by one of these individuals?

01:49:40.428 --> 01:49:41.480
MATT: Escorted by one of these, yes.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:44.863
LIAM: If I see one or two people going in or out
what do they look like?

01:49:46.263 --> 01:49:51.594
MATT: One of them you see appears to be a woman,
very well dressed, looks to be a high collar, a

01:49:51.594 --> 01:49:57.076
buttoned up blouse of some kind, a dress that just
barely cuts off right where her ankles hit the

01:49:57.076 --> 01:50:02.589
ground with very nice shoes. Looks to be a very
well off humanoid woman, a human.

01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:04.640
SAM: Does she look grumpy?

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:12.198
MATT: She looks stoic. Leaves with a very--
(laughs)

01:50:12.198 --> 01:50:14.114
SAM: Is she leaving or coming?

01:50:14.114 --> 01:50:14.763
MATT: Leaving.

01:50:14.763 --> 01:50:16.112
SAM: I will follow her.

01:50:16.112 --> 01:50:29.887
MATT: Okay. The other one looks to be a man
probably in his late 30s or so, also human. He has

01:50:29.887 --> 01:50:36.217
a cluster of small pieces of parchment that are
folded and wadded into his arm and he's leaving

01:50:36.217 --> 01:50:40.849
like he just was either taking something out or
just retrieving something.

01:50:40.849 --> 01:50:41.894
LIAM: Same fancy type?

01:50:41.894 --> 01:50:46.254
MATT: Less fancy than her, but still more well off
than most of the other individuals that have

01:50:46.254 --> 01:50:46.740
passed through.

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:48.235
LIAM: Fancier than me?

01:50:48.235 --> 01:50:49.298
MATT: Oh yeah.

01:50:49.298 --> 01:50:55.174
LIAM: Yeah. Okay. That's a beautiful building.
They're all wearing the same thing.

01:50:55.174 --> 01:50:56.406
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:50:56.406 --> 01:50:59.711
LIAM: You've lived here for a few months. What do
you know about this place?

01:51:02.251 --> 01:51:05.800
MARISHA: There's a lot of books in it and fancy
people are super interested in it.

01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:12.961
LIAM: Obviously I am very interested in learning.
Is it easy to gain admittance? Do you know that

01:51:12.961 --> 01:51:13.851
sort of thing?

01:51:13.851 --> 01:51:15.570
MARISHA: I'm not entirely sure.

01:51:15.570 --> 01:51:16.302
LIAM: Oh.

01:51:16.302 --> 01:51:19.135
MARISHA: I know that they're super into their
knowledge.

01:51:19.135 --> 01:51:19.730
LIAM: Yeah.

01:51:19.730 --> 01:51:24.103
MARISHA: They're like "Eh, knowledge, means you're
like powerful or something."

01:51:24.103 --> 01:51:25.378
LIAM: Yeah, that's what it means.

01:51:25.378 --> 01:51:26.158
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:51:26.158 --> 01:51:26.706
LIAM: Yeah.

01:51:26.706 --> 01:51:33.376
MARISHA: Knowing's better, yeah, books.

01:51:33.376 --> 01:51:36.567
LIAM: Well, you've really sold me on it, let's go
find the others.

01:51:36.567 --> 01:51:37.146
MARISHA: Yep.

01:51:39.186 --> 01:51:41.888
MATT: While that's happening, you are following
this woman down.

01:51:41.888 --> 01:51:44.341
SAM: I'll try to stay 25 feet behind her.

01:51:44.341 --> 01:51:45.509
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:51:45.509 --> 01:51:47.740
SAM and LAURA: Ooh.

01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:51.980
SAM: 13? Oh! 15.

01:51:53.510 --> 01:52:01.358
MATT: Okay. No one immediately seems to pay mind
and she's currently eyes on the prize, heading in

01:52:01.358 --> 01:52:08.363
some direction with earnest intent. The escort, of
course, that had helped her out of the Archive

01:52:08.363 --> 01:52:13.807
stays behind and reenters the building, and she
continues on her own, but stays mainly on the main

01:52:13.807 --> 01:52:17.440
streets; doesn't go and duck into any alleyways
very much for her own personal safety during the

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.624
day and staying out in the open.

01:52:19.624 --> 01:52:26.911
SAM: Does she have any bag, purse, visible
necklace, pockets, anything pickable?

01:52:26.911 --> 01:52:32.090
MATT: There do appear to be two small pockets in
the front waist part of the blouse and a small

01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:38.522
satchel that's hanging off the right, over the
left shoulder, off the right side of the body.

01:52:38.522 --> 01:52:43.702
LIAM: Do I have any chance in hell knowing where
she went? Because I start looking around immediately.

01:52:43.702 --> 01:52:45.785
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:52:45.785 --> 01:52:48.282
LIAM: Okay, no. That's a one.

01:52:48.282 --> 01:52:51.013
MATT: You have no idea. You come back and Nott's
gone.

01:52:51.013 --> 01:52:53.471
LIAM: (panicked mumbling)

01:52:53.471 --> 01:52:58.233
MARISHA: She's an adult goblin woman girl, she's
fine.

01:52:59.703 --> 01:53:03.193
LIAM: You're not helping me. Like at all.

01:53:05.463 --> 01:53:09.430
MARISHA: Okay, I look around. Do I see Nott? Kind
of haphazardly.

01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:12.939
MATT: No. Not at this point.

01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:16.402
LIAM: We are going to look around now is what
we're doing.

01:53:16.402 --> 01:53:21.009
MATT: While the rest of you are regathering
yourselves together to continue onto the next

01:53:21.009 --> 01:53:22.759
length of your journey, Nott--

01:53:22.759 --> 01:53:28.731
SAM: I'm going to cast Mage Hand and try to pick--
well, let's see, can I unbuckle the satchel thing

01:53:28.731 --> 01:53:31.508
or would it be easier to just get in a pocket?

01:53:32.468 --> 01:53:33.418
MATT: It's up to you.

01:53:33.418 --> 01:53:35.159
SAM: I'll go in a pocket, I guess.

01:53:35.159 --> 01:53:36.125
MATT: The front pocket?

01:53:37.485 --> 01:53:39.449
SAM: You said she had two side pockets, I think?

01:53:39.449 --> 01:53:41.311
MATT: Yeah, the front of the blouse.

01:53:42.681 --> 01:53:44.157
LAURA: Front of the blouse.

01:53:44.157 --> 01:53:48.119
SAM: Front of the blouse or a satchel on her side?

01:53:48.119 --> 01:53:48.876
MATT: Yeah.

01:53:48.876 --> 01:53:50.303
SAM: I'll do the side satchel.

01:53:50.303 --> 01:53:53.067
MATT: Go ahead and roll sleight of hand, please.

01:53:53.067 --> 01:53:53.912
SAM: Okay.

01:53:55.472 --> 01:53:57.161
TRAVIS: (laughing) What is it?

01:53:57.161 --> 01:53:57.587
SAM: 11.

01:53:57.587 --> 01:53:58.670
MATT: Okay.

01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:02.083
TALIESIN: Higher than ten.

01:54:02.083 --> 01:54:03.908
TRAVIS: Is she still with one of the--?

01:54:03.908 --> 01:54:05.560
LAURA: No, she's alone.

01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:15.993
MATT: As you're walking and you're concentrating,
you watch as the satchel itself lifts and tugs and

01:54:15.993 --> 01:54:22.437
just tugs. Her head spins around and looks behind
her, looks back.

01:54:25.237 --> 01:54:26.787
SAM: I press up against the wall.

01:54:28.477 --> 01:54:35.391
MATT: Glances around confused, eyes one of the
small pauper children that's off to the side,

01:54:35.391 --> 01:54:37.812
begging on the side of the road--

01:54:37.812 --> 01:54:39.628
ALL: Oh no.

01:54:39.628 --> 01:54:40.445
SAM: It was that one.

01:54:40.445 --> 01:54:44.313
MATT: Scoffs and holds her chin up and then
continues walking with a brisker pace.

01:54:44.313 --> 01:54:45.985
SAM: I follow at a brisker pace.

01:54:45.985 --> 01:54:47.728
MATT: Make another stealth check, please.

01:54:49.828 --> 01:54:51.560
SAM: Stealth? 22.

01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:52.664
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

01:54:52.664 --> 01:54:54.611
TRAVIS: Yeah, killed the baby and false
imprisonment for the kids.

01:54:54.611 --> 01:54:57.338
LIAM: That's how the empire works.

01:54:57.338 --> 01:55:00.860
MATT: Okay, brisker pace, but does not seemed to
take notice of your tracking.

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:04.551
SAM: I'll get a little closer this time and try
for one of the pockets this time.

01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:05.342
MATT: Okay.

01:55:05.342 --> 01:55:06.319
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:55:09.479 --> 01:55:12.243
SAM: Ooh. 12.

01:55:12.243 --> 01:55:13.446
LIAM: That's better.

01:55:18.226 --> 01:55:24.302
MATT: There's a brief moment where you've watched
the flap of the blouse open up and expand a bit as

01:55:24.302 --> 01:55:29.430
the Mage Hand begins to reach in for what is
within and then with a slight tug you watch as two

01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:36.409
of the blouse buttons bounce off and just a bit of
the brassiere shows and she closes her shirt real

01:55:36.409 --> 01:55:40.530
fast and looks about again and turns and what you
can see is a man there who's selling apples on a

01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:45.766
small cart on the side, is maybe two feet from her
and goes "Miss?" With the apple and she smacks him

01:55:45.766 --> 01:55:51.461
right in the face and he, "What was-- what?!" "How
<i>dare</i> you."

01:55:51.461 --> 01:55:53.131
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:55:53.131 --> 01:55:58.084
MATT: Then holding her shirt closed and bundles up
her satchel up in her arms and is now beelining it

01:55:58.084 --> 01:55:59.190
deeper into the city.

01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:00.915
TRAVIS: Don't let her get away with that.

01:56:00.915 --> 01:56:04.168
SAM: I run up to where that happened and pick up
the two buttons.

01:56:04.168 --> 01:56:09.372
(laughter)

01:56:09.372 --> 01:56:10.789
MATT: They're nice buttons.

01:56:10.789 --> 01:56:21.034
SAM: I come back. I did it! I got these two
things. They're very nice and round and shiny.

01:56:21.034 --> 01:56:23.166
LIAM: They're very nice. Where did they come from?

01:56:23.166 --> 01:56:29.181
SAM: A very grumpy person. She was awful. She
scowled at children and slapped an innocent man

01:56:29.181 --> 01:56:33.266
for no reason. She was evil!

01:56:33.266 --> 01:56:36.975
LIAM: Insight check. That is a 20.

01:56:39.675 --> 01:56:42.320
MATT: If you want to insight check her, you've got
to make a deception check.

01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:44.434
LIAM: Well, maybe she believes it, I don't know.

01:56:44.434 --> 01:56:47.516
SAM: I believe it! She was a horrible person.

01:56:48.466 --> 01:56:50.583
LIAM: Yeah, okay well.

01:56:51.433 --> 01:56:53.936
SAM: My itch has been scratched.

01:56:55.456 --> 01:56:57.875
TALIESIN: I feel good about everything that just
happened.

01:56:57.875 --> 01:57:06.292
LAURA: In the time that Nott was gone could I spot
the Allhammer temple? Just so I know where it is?

01:57:06.292 --> 01:57:07.950
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:57:09.170 --> 01:57:10.691
TALIESIN: Or the Platinum House.

01:57:13.461 --> 01:57:14.691
LAURA: 12.

01:57:20.501 --> 01:57:27.855
MATT: Unfortunately no, the Platinum House nor the
Hearth of the Allhammer were noticed. The Hearth

01:57:27.855 --> 01:57:32.279
of the Allhammer is in the Pentamarket on the
northern side and you guys had cut through to get

01:57:32.279 --> 01:57:38.261
directly to the vicinity of the bathhouse. In the
area you are now in the city, you don't have any

01:57:38.261 --> 01:57:44.259
sort of visual on the Platinum House. As you guys
have gathered yourselves together and you make

01:57:44.259 --> 01:57:51.128
your way towards The Steam's Respite, we're going
to take a break! Because it is nine o'clock.

01:57:51.128 --> 01:57:53.478
LAURA and MARISHA: Nein.

01:57:53.478 --> 01:57:56.514
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes, we'll
make this as quick of a break as we can so we can

01:57:56.514 --> 01:58:00.846
jump back in. In the meantime, guys, sit tight,
we'll see you again in a few minutes.

01:58:00.846 --> 01:58:03.401
ALL: Yeah!

01:58:03.401 --> 02:12:46.890
[break]

02:12:46.890 --> 02:12:57.329
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Welcome back. Thank
you for your patience. Once again, you didn't miss

02:12:57.592 --> 02:13:01.585
anything. Sorry, we didn't have a giveaway this
week. We hope to have one up and going real soon

02:13:01.585 --> 02:13:05.213
from our folks at Wyrmwood. In the meantime, hang
tight, you didn't miss anything.

02:13:05.713 --> 02:13:07.664
MARISHA: You have shit all over your arm!

02:13:07.664 --> 02:13:09.083
LIAM: Oh, I pooped on myself.

02:13:09.083 --> 02:13:10.493
MARISHA: Ew, you really are Caleb. What is that?

02:13:10.493 --> 02:13:13.713
LIAM: That's not poop, that's where I've had this
circle.

02:13:13.713 --> 02:13:14.732
MARISHA: No, that is--

02:13:14.732 --> 02:13:16.096
LIAM: That's Pocky chocolate.

02:13:16.096 --> 02:13:18.053
MARISHA: I'm going to dad thumb you.

02:13:18.053 --> 02:13:19.688
LIAM: That's Pocky chocolate.

02:13:19.688 --> 02:13:20.471
MARISHA: That's gross.

02:13:20.471 --> 02:13:22.217
LIAM: It's just fecal matter, it's not like
it's--

02:13:23.237 --> 02:13:32.733
MATT: Anyway, welcome back, guys. Great to have
you. You guys coast alongside the road leading

02:13:32.733 --> 02:13:39.848
towards the Steam's Respite. You catch a glance at
the King's Hall. You see a massive structure of

02:13:39.848 --> 02:13:45.808
bronze and cobalt that is, essentially, the
central courthouse of the city. You can see its

02:13:45.808 --> 02:13:55.120
this massive, tall, single story that stands at
least 20 feet high, with long thin windows about

02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:01.651
every 15 or so feet. The crownsguard presence is
pretty thick. You see probably, at first glance,

02:14:01.651 --> 02:14:09.011
at least ten or so that are watching the front as
general sentries. There it is. You do also, at a

02:14:09.011 --> 02:14:15.418
quick glance, see a ten-foot by five-foot large,
heavy piece of wooden board that is standing on

02:14:15.418 --> 02:14:20.350
its own about four feet from the main entrance to
the right. It has a number of pieces of parchment

02:14:20.350 --> 02:14:25.452
stuck to it. Are you guys continuing on? Head to
the bath house? What are you doing?

02:14:25.712 --> 02:14:27.088
MARISHA: Take a gander?

02:14:27.088 --> 02:14:30.935
TALIESIN: We've got Mr. Memory Board here to scan
the thing.

02:14:30.935 --> 02:14:32.752
LIAM: Yeah, I just take a quick look at it.

02:14:34.232 --> 02:14:36.739
LAURA: Are there people watching the board right
now?

02:14:36.739 --> 02:14:41.957
MATT: Looks like there's one person scanning past
in the process of reading and looking at things as

02:14:41.957 --> 02:14:50.238
they go. Looks to be a person in basic leather
armors. Probably a sellsword of some kind.

02:14:50.238 --> 02:14:56.788
LAURA: As soon as he walks away, is there anybody,
any guards looking at the board?

02:14:56.788 --> 02:15:03.353
MATT: Not directly reading it, but there are,
right now, four that are within a 15-foot

02:15:03.353 --> 02:15:04.215
proximity of it.

02:15:04.215 --> 02:15:07.120
MARISHA: That's a lot of guards.

02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:09.746
LAURA: That's a lot of guards at this one board.

02:15:09.746 --> 02:15:15.220
MATT: Well, the board's right at the front what is
essentially the courthouse center of the entire city.

02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:17.602
TRAVIS: Are we all hanging back? I'll walk up with
Caleb.

02:15:18.492 --> 02:15:19.313
TALIESIN: Works for me.

02:15:19.313 --> 02:15:23.641
SAM: Is there a place I can duck away for a
second, or is there a--

02:15:23.641 --> 02:15:26.543
MATT: There is away from the building, but there's
nothing--

02:15:26.543 --> 02:15:32.280
SAM: I walk away from the building, cast Disguise
Self on myself and make myself look exactly like Fjord.

02:15:33.450 --> 02:15:34.655
MATT: Just a shorter version.

02:15:34.655 --> 02:15:37.809
MARISHA: But tiny? Oh my god.

02:15:37.809 --> 02:15:41.401
SAM: I've never done this before. I've only seen
people do that, so that's what I'm going to do.

02:15:41.401 --> 02:15:46.402
MATT: The height difference you can create with
Disguise Self, I believe, is it a foot?

02:15:46.402 --> 02:15:47.014
SAM: Uh-huh.

02:15:47.014 --> 02:15:48.957
MATT: Yeah, so you have--

02:15:48.957 --> 02:15:50.136
SAM: I'm four-foot tall.

02:15:50.136 --> 02:15:51.142
MATT: You're a four-foot tall Fjord.

02:15:51.142 --> 02:15:52.070
TRAVIS: Fjord Junior.

02:15:52.070 --> 02:15:57.634
MATT: A perfect replica of Fjord on a smaller
scale emerges from the shadows and sidles up

02:15:57.634 --> 02:15:58.842
alongside you, Fjord.

02:15:58.842 --> 02:16:01.071
MARISHA: It's a very focused Fjord.

02:16:01.071 --> 02:16:04.085
TRAVIS: Oh wow. Like a tiny little Fiesta.

02:16:06.455 --> 02:16:07.388
SAM: Howdy.

02:16:09.248 --> 02:16:11.614
LIAM: Are you doing a variation of Mother's Love
right now?

02:16:12.474 --> 02:16:16.335
SAM: Well, I've never used this spell before, so I
just did what you did.

02:16:16.335 --> 02:16:20.912
LIAM: That's good. Mistakes that I have made,
learn from them. Keep quiet.

02:16:20.912 --> 02:16:22.232
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say the same.

02:16:22.952 --> 02:16:23.796
SAM: (softer) Howdy.

02:16:30.496 --> 02:16:38.824
MATT: As you approach the board, which you can see
has atop of it pressed into the wood the lettering

02:16:38.824 --> 02:16:48.876
that say Task Board. The heavy, wooden board looks
like in immediate view of it, there are maybe

02:16:48.876 --> 02:16:55.961
eight pieces of paper that are currently stapled
to it with various rusted nails that have been

02:16:55.961 --> 02:17:00.727
reused, and they have been placed onto it, or have
been stuck in and then replaced into it. There's

02:17:00.727 --> 02:17:06.538
probably close to 45 or 50 other rusted nails that
are stuck there and have been left that have

02:17:06.538 --> 02:17:12.225
currently holding nothing to it. You do see
through a first glance, both of you, as you look

02:17:12.225 --> 02:17:19.032
past them, a lot of them are looking for general
work helping construction, some are looking for

02:17:19.032 --> 02:17:23.929
people that want to help reinforce buildings that
are crumbling, there are some that are looking for

02:17:23.929 --> 02:17:31.571
folks that can help shoo away parts of the
Outersteads that are encroaching upon the

02:17:31.571 --> 02:17:38.218
farmlands on the outside of the wall. You do see
one that says, "Seeking and paying for any

02:17:38.218 --> 02:17:40.865
information on Myriad activity in the city."

02:17:42.925 --> 02:17:44.569
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Cops.

02:17:44.569 --> 02:17:47.073
SAM: I don't know what that is. Okay.

02:17:49.283 --> 02:17:53.842
MATT: There is one that says, "Reward for
information on rebel gatherings and anti-Crown rhetoric."

02:17:53.842 --> 02:17:54.969
MARISHA: Ooh.

02:17:55.695 --> 02:17:57.087
MATT: There's one that says--

02:17:57.087 --> 02:17:57.766
SAM: Let's do it!

02:17:57.766 --> 02:18:07.627
MATT: There's another that says, "Proof of others'
worship of heretical gods paid in gold." One that

02:18:07.627 --> 02:18:11.767
says, "Looking for work for the glory of our King
Bertrand. Good pay and adventurous living as a

02:18:11.767 --> 02:18:17.483
soldier of the Righteous Brand. Seek Leopold
Wanstiker at the Marrow Keep."

02:18:19.733 --> 02:18:20.631
SAM: What?

02:18:20.631 --> 02:18:25.243
MATT: Wanstiker. Wanstiker.

02:18:25.243 --> 02:18:29.577
LAURA: Can I try sleight of hand and just try to
make that into Wangstacker?

02:18:29.577 --> 02:18:30.803
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

02:18:32.473 --> 02:18:33.379
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

02:18:33.379 --> 02:18:34.927
LIAM: So we're all up there now?

02:18:36.237 --> 02:18:37.037
MATT: Apparently.

02:18:38.447 --> 02:18:39.648
LAURA: It was a 12.

02:18:46.248 --> 02:18:52.488
MATT: No one seems to notice as you quickly
scribble out and alter the visual to where it says

02:18:53.181 --> 02:19:02.496
"Wangstacker at the Marrow Keep in the Signet
Wall," and then, "Roving beast in need of

02:19:02.496 --> 02:19:04.984
extermination. Must be trained sellsword with
experience."

02:19:04.984 --> 02:19:08.281
MARISHA: That's right up our alley!
Extermination!

02:19:08.281 --> 02:19:09.438
LIAM: Control action.

02:19:10.878 --> 02:19:17.264
MATT: There looks to be one piece of engraved
brass or bronze material on the side that says,

02:19:17.264 --> 02:19:23.881
"All job inquiries to be taken to Herald of the
Hall Voloshin within."

02:19:23.881 --> 02:19:25.355
MARISHA: The fucking Herald.

02:19:26.215 --> 02:19:28.679
LIAM: Would you repeat that last phrase please,
DM?

02:19:28.679 --> 02:19:34.701
MATT: Oh, "All job inquiries are to be taken to
Herald of the Hall--"

02:19:34.701 --> 02:19:35.793
LIAM: Herald of the Hall.

02:19:35.793 --> 02:19:37.274
MATT: Voloshin.

02:19:37.274 --> 02:19:38.033
LIAM: Voloshin?

02:19:38.033 --> 02:19:39.577
MATT: Yeah. V-O-L-O-S-H-I-N.

02:19:39.577 --> 02:19:42.605
MARISHA: It's the guy the town crier said.

02:19:45.695 --> 02:19:52.284
SAM: Personally, I think that we should turn in
those devious schemers and get all the gold we can.

02:19:52.284 --> 02:19:59.361
TRAVIS: No, look, come on. They confided in us.
The last thing we should do is turn on that just

02:19:59.361 --> 02:20:00.587
for a simple coin.

02:20:00.587 --> 02:20:05.298
MARISHA: Besides, did you see how many posts on
that board were all revolved around ratting people out?

02:20:05.321 --> 02:20:09.503
LIAM: Yeah, I also don't want to stick my neck
out, but anything that is a thumb in the eye of

02:20:09.503 --> 02:20:10.967
the Empire, I'm all for.

02:20:10.967 --> 02:20:14.957
TALIESIN: Stitches get-- eh <i>snitches</i> get
stitches. Stitches are just--

02:20:14.957 --> 02:20:17.560
SAM AND TALIESIN: Stitches.

02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:20.202
TALIESIN: Snitches get stitches-- wait--

02:20:20.202 --> 02:20:22.071
MARISHA: Stitches are just stitches?

02:20:22.071 --> 02:20:24.123
SAM: In the original Zimean--

02:20:24.123 --> 02:20:25.998
LAURA: It makes more sense.

02:20:25.998 --> 02:20:27.205
TALIESIN: One of the few.

02:20:27.205 --> 02:20:29.999
TRAVIS: I personally enjoyed the last beast that
we slayed, but I think that we have plenty to

02:20:29.999 --> 02:20:33.456
discuss in that warm bath you're talking about.

02:20:35.236 --> 02:20:36.162
TALIESIN: It's time for a bath.

02:20:36.162 --> 02:20:42.975
MARISHA: As we walk there I talk to Caleb. You
mentioned being like "Bah! Empire!"

02:20:43.568 --> 02:20:45.979
LIAM: Just now or do you mean just a moment ago?

02:20:45.979 --> 02:20:46.523
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:20:46.523 --> 02:20:49.965
LAURA: Don't say it in the open, you guys, wait
until we're in the bath.

02:20:49.965 --> 02:20:55.054
SAM: Yeah, let's just mosey onto the bath, nice,
slow, and steady.

02:20:55.563 --> 02:21:00.435
TRAVIS: Can you put your thumbs in your pocket and
give a little waddle?

02:21:01.133 --> 02:21:01.941
SAM: (pathetically) Hyuck, hyuck.

02:21:01.941 --> 02:21:10.085
(laughing)

02:21:10.085 --> 02:21:11.791
TRAVIS: You look right on, right there.

02:21:11.791 --> 02:21:13.774
LIAM: He's a little tiny mosey--

02:21:13.774 --> 02:21:14.840
MARISHA: It's so cute!

02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:16.186
LAURA: It's tiny little Fjord!

02:21:16.186 --> 02:21:18.769
TALIESIN: This is a dark mirror, man. A dark, dark
mirror.

02:21:18.769 --> 02:21:20.771
TRAVIS: Give a little spit, so people know you're
coming.

02:21:20.771 --> 02:21:22.121
SAM: (spitting)

02:21:22.121 --> 02:21:23.282
TRAVIS: (tinging)

02:21:23.282 --> 02:21:24.468
SAM: (western flute trill)

02:21:24.468 --> 02:21:27.519
MATT: Which is strange because the spit actually
emerges from your sternum.

02:21:27.519 --> 02:21:31.826
(laughing)

02:21:32.936 --> 02:21:36.802
MATT: As you progress, you eventually find
yourself to the outside of The Steam's Respite.

02:21:38.662 --> 02:21:42.695
Fairly simple looking building, of deeply
dark-stained wood slats that are all vertical

02:21:42.695 --> 02:21:52.811
against heavy load-bearing columns at each major
corner, but it's fairly sizeable for its simple exterior.

02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:58.671
TALIESIN: I've learned one thing in my travels:
always hit the bathhouse first. Every major town.

02:22:00.221 --> 02:22:00.961
TRAVIS: Good to know.

02:22:01.271 --> 02:22:02.626
LIAM: Finally, a bath.

02:22:04.666 --> 02:22:08.088
MATT: You guys walk your way into the main
chamber. There's a couple benches to the right and

02:22:08.088 --> 02:22:15.980
left of you. There's some small planters that have
low-light plants being kept in the area to give a

02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:24.273
fresher scent. There is a small chair and a desk
set up with a clerk, an older female half-orc,

02:22:24.273 --> 02:22:33.417
hunched but smiling with her hair gray, thick hair
braided up on the sides and pinned in the back

02:22:33.417 --> 02:22:44.698
with a long spike of some kind with a lower jaw
that extends with two visible tusks, but a warm

02:22:44.698 --> 02:22:52.376
smile amongst the rest of the nice flower dress
that she wears. As you approach, she looks up from

02:22:52.376 --> 02:23:03.997
the desk. "Hello! You've come to the Respite. I am
Miss Rima. Are all of you here for a bath?"

02:23:03.997 --> 02:23:05.817
LAURA: Yes, Miss Rima!

02:23:08.237 --> 02:23:10.078
MATT: "Would you like individual rooms?"

02:23:11.688 --> 02:23:16.305
LAURA: Oh, I think we plan on doing a lot of
stuff, so probably all together.

02:23:16.305 --> 02:23:23.468
MATT: "Right, so the Common Room. It is less
expensive, but less private. For the six of you,

02:23:23.468 --> 02:23:27.898
for the Common Chamber, that'll run about three
silver apiece."

02:23:27.898 --> 02:23:28.991
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

02:23:28.991 --> 02:23:30.246
TRAVIS: Quite reasonable.

02:23:30.246 --> 02:23:36.700
LAURA: Rima, is there someone who can take
clothing and clean it up as well while we are

02:23:36.700 --> 02:23:37.295
bathing?"

02:23:37.295 --> 02:23:46.188
MATT: "That can be provided at an additional cost,
my dear. That'll be an additional one silver each

02:23:46.188 --> 02:23:49.084
for the washing and cleaning fee."

02:23:49.084 --> 02:23:50.012
TALIESIN: Oh, happily.

02:23:50.012 --> 02:23:50.855
MARISHA: I'll take it.

02:23:50.855 --> 02:23:52.301
LIAM: I'll pass on it.

02:23:54.221 --> 02:23:55.388
LAURA: You probably shouldn't, though.

02:23:57.188 --> 02:23:59.376
TRAVIS: He's all clean right now. Pumat Sol
cleaned him up.

02:24:00.506 --> 02:24:02.673
LAURA: They can stitch up the holes and stuff.

02:24:02.673 --> 02:24:04.260
LIAM: The clothes are still pretty shit, though.

02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:06.506
LAURA: No, you were Prestidigitation-ed.

02:24:08.126 --> 02:24:12.851
LIAM: My hair is killer right now. The clothes are
old and shitty.

02:24:12.851 --> 02:24:15.463
MATT: The clothes are cleaner, they're just
tattered and patched.

02:24:16.233 --> 02:24:17.479
LIAM: Some stink don't come off.

02:24:17.479 --> 02:24:20.018
LAURA: Ew! Like the poop splatter!

02:24:20.018 --> 02:24:21.729
LIAM: I meant blood, but sure.

02:24:24.729 --> 02:24:26.124
LIAM: The poop is right there.

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:30.385
TALIESIN: Early 90s River Phoenix hair going
everywhere of its own volition.

02:24:31.225 --> 02:24:33.079
TRAVIS: I'd like to have my clothes cleaned, yes.

02:24:33.079 --> 02:24:34.761
LAURA: Four silver.

02:24:34.761 --> 02:24:46.570
MATT: "Four, eight, 12, 16, 23 silver for the lot.
Thank you so much." Takes the change, leads you

02:24:46.570 --> 02:24:54.286
into a back chamber where you get undressed. There
is a doorway that leads open into a central common

02:24:54.286 --> 02:25:01.143
hot spring bath that is dug out of the ground
here. It has a rock perimeter to it, and the steam

02:25:01.143 --> 02:25:07.537
immediately hits you. It smells of herbs and
soaps. The water itself is somewhat cloudy, and it

02:25:07.537 --> 02:25:10.978
looks like there's maybe only four other people in
there, obscured by the steam at the edges of the

02:25:10.978 --> 02:25:18.813
pool. As Miss Rima leaves your presence, you guys
can finish disrobing and leaving your clothing

02:25:18.813 --> 02:25:20.897
behind and enter the bathhouse.

02:25:22.217 --> 02:25:28.306
MARISHA: I go in, and I'm like that drunk person
at the hot tub at the hotel. Hi, how are you guys

02:25:28.306 --> 02:25:33.387
doing? Excuse me! Scoot over! I got more friends
coming.

02:25:33.983 --> 02:25:37.368
LAURA: I run by her and say cannonball! And jump
in.

02:25:37.368 --> 02:25:38.773
MATT: (water splashing)

02:25:38.773 --> 02:25:39.351
MARISHA: Told you.

02:25:41.231 --> 02:25:47.611
MATT: As the explosion of water hits, there's this
older couple in their 70s or so that, as you

02:25:47.611 --> 02:25:53.647
muscle in, they slowly scoot away. There's this
splash and they both (upset squealing) and avoid

02:25:54.266 --> 02:25:55.056
the space.

02:25:55.056 --> 02:25:56.475
TRAVIS: (elderly voice) My anniversary!

02:25:58.235 --> 02:26:01.748
MATT: As you come up out of the water, Jester, and
(breathes), you hair flaps back on the back of

02:26:01.748 --> 02:26:02.910
your neck.

02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:04.187
LAURA: Hair like the Little Mermaid.

02:26:06.257 --> 02:26:10.546
MATT: Your eyes focus, and you see a familiar face
in the water across from you. Leaning, arms

02:26:10.546 --> 02:26:17.270
akimbo, against the rock, with a thick hilt of a
sword just resting, apparently--

02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:18.390
TRAVIS: In the hot tub?!

02:26:18.390 --> 02:26:24.368
MATT: In the hot tub. You see a familiar
pale-looking, muscular woman, with darker hair

02:26:24.374 --> 02:26:28.997
that fades to light, as there is Yasha, staring at
you with a curious look.

02:26:28.997 --> 02:26:34.304
(cheering)

02:26:34.304 --> 02:26:35.883
MARISHA: Fresh off the east coast!

02:26:35.883 --> 02:26:37.254
TRAVIS: Beast mode!

02:26:38.464 --> 02:26:39.603
MATT: Scoot in a bit.

02:26:39.603 --> 02:26:40.730
ASHLEY: Oh, hi!

02:26:40.730 --> 02:26:46.019
ALL: Oh, hi!

02:26:46.019 --> 02:26:55.720
ASHLEY: I'm here! A little sleepy, but I'm here!
Oh! Well, if it isn't my old friends.

02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:56.578
MARISHA: The fuck?

02:26:56.578 --> 02:26:58.542
LAURA: Oh my god, Yasha!

02:26:58.542 --> 02:27:04.984
ASHLEY: You know, I've been tracking you guys for
quite some time, and I knew you were here, but I

02:27:04.984 --> 02:27:11.734
just figured I might want to get a bath first and
get a rub down. Treat myself.

02:27:13.204 --> 02:27:15.949
TRAVIS: Oh man. You come to these places a lot?
I've never been.

02:27:18.519 --> 02:27:21.711
ASHLEY: I enjoy sometimes the finer things of
life.

02:27:21.711 --> 02:27:22.970
MARISHA: She rolled with Molly.

02:27:22.970 --> 02:27:28.018
TALIESIN: I walk out of the changing room and walk
by, don't even-- just give a kiss on the head.

02:27:28.018 --> 02:27:29.670
Took you bloody long enough to find us.

02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:32.280
ASHLEY: I know, I'm sorry. I had some things to
do.

02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:34.947
TALIESIN: I'm, for the record, tattooed a lot.

02:27:36.217 --> 02:27:36.941
MATT: Explain the tattoos.

02:27:36.941 --> 02:27:42.349
TALIESIN: Okay. I apologize that there's no art
yet. I'll get around to that. There's a snake

02:27:42.349 --> 02:27:47.487
tattoo that curls all the way up the arm. That
goes all the way up into the peacock-- people have

02:27:47.487 --> 02:27:52.939
seen the top of the peacock, but the peacock is
actually roving into a big floral piece that goes down

02:27:52.939 --> 02:27:58.548
into a snake that is swallowing the hand. There is
an eye in a pyramid piece with another eye

02:27:58.548 --> 02:28:02.882
illuminated above it. It seems to almost go into
the hairline, all the way up the back. There's a

02:28:02.882 --> 02:28:08.230
moon and sun connected to the shoulder piece that
all interconnects. The whole thing's very complicated.

02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:09.800
LAURA: Is it all upper body?

02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:10.675
TALIESIN: It is all upper body, yeah.

02:28:10.675 --> 02:28:12.515
LAURA: What about the Prince Albert?

02:28:12.515 --> 02:28:16.454
TALIESIN: Except for-- do you actually know what
that is?

02:28:16.454 --> 02:28:17.022
LAURA: I do.

02:28:17.022 --> 02:28:17.645
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I don't.

02:28:17.645 --> 02:28:20.344
TRAVIS: She knows a lot about dicks, remember?

02:28:20.804 --> 02:28:25.782
SAM: Poor Ashley. Wherever she goes, it's body
tattoos.

02:28:25.782 --> 02:28:31.509
(laughter)

02:28:31.509 --> 02:28:38.319
ASHLEY: I found him in the woods. In a Bag of
Holding.

02:28:39.249 --> 02:28:42.071
TALIESIN: Each tattoo has 15 meanings.

02:28:44.201 --> 02:28:47.228
LIAM: Have you been hot on our heels this whole
time to keep pace with us?

02:28:47.844 --> 02:28:51.900
ASHLEY: You guys are not very discreet. You're
pretty easy to follow.

02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:53.616
LAURA: Did you see what happened in Alfield?

02:28:54.206 --> 02:28:55.049
ASHLEY: Uh, yeah.

02:28:57.679 --> 02:28:59.253
LAURA: That was us. We killed them all.

02:28:59.253 --> 02:29:05.202
ASHLEY: Okay. I came for the aftermath of it, but
I didn't see. Or I would have jumped in and

02:29:05.202 --> 02:29:06.369
helped, of course.

02:29:06.369 --> 02:29:11.728
SAM: Why are you following us? And by the way,
even though I am totally naked, I still look like--

02:29:11.728 --> 02:29:17.507
MATT: A fully clothed, tiny Fjord. Yeah. Even when
you remove your clothing, they just shed off your

02:29:17.507 --> 02:29:20.556
body and they still visually appear on you. It's a
very strange visual.

02:29:21.486 --> 02:29:23.213
SAM: It's me, the goblin, by the way.

02:29:23.213 --> 02:29:25.902
ASHLEY: Oh. I do remember you quite well.

02:29:26.492 --> 02:29:28.343
SAM: Why were you following us?

02:29:28.713 --> 02:29:33.063
ASHLEY: I said I was going to meet you here in
Zadash.

02:29:33.063 --> 02:29:34.772
LAURA: We told her where we were going to go.

02:29:34.772 --> 02:29:38.819
SAM: Oh. But don't you have mysterious big person
things to do?

02:29:38.819 --> 02:29:42.004
ASHLEY: I did. I have things that I occasionally
tend to, and I did.

02:29:42.004 --> 02:29:43.297
SAM: Did you do them?

02:29:44.697 --> 02:29:45.405
ASHLEY: Ish.

02:29:47.475 --> 02:29:49.322
SAM: (whispering) So mysterious.

02:29:49.322 --> 02:29:53.408
ASHLEY: It's not that mysterious. I just have
things that I have to do sometimes.

02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:55.418
TRAVIS: We're looking to get in some--

02:29:55.418 --> 02:29:56.438
ASHLEY: Trouble?

02:29:56.438 --> 02:29:57.261
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:29:57.261 --> 02:29:59.601
TALIESIN: They paid us 60 gold for three days.

02:29:59.601 --> 02:30:01.617
ASHLEY: You made 60 gold in three days?

02:30:01.617 --> 02:30:03.232
LAURA: We killed things for money!

02:30:03.232 --> 02:30:04.769
TALIESIN: I've never made money like this.

02:30:04.769 --> 02:30:07.839
TRAVIS: We've got the head of a manticore out on
our cart. Melting in the sun.

02:30:07.839 --> 02:30:09.348
SAM: I stole two buttons!

02:30:11.728 --> 02:30:16.469
ASHLEY: Oh. How nice! What do they look like,
these buttons?

02:30:17.709 --> 02:30:21.311
SAM: They're in my existing clothes.

02:30:21.311 --> 02:30:22.572
ASHLEY: Your other clothing?

02:30:22.572 --> 02:30:24.647
SAM: They're in the other room. They're very nice,
though.

02:30:24.647 --> 02:30:27.751
ASHLEY; You're among friends. You don't have to
wear any clothes if you don't want.

02:30:27.751 --> 02:30:28.998
SAM: No, I'm okay.

02:30:32.428 --> 02:30:35.453
LAURA: Oh, are you free of bandages and everything
too and we just can't see it?

02:30:35.453 --> 02:30:37.953
SAM: Yeah, I handed all of those bandages to be
washed.

02:30:37.953 --> 02:30:41.882
(laughter)

02:30:41.882 --> 02:30:50.953
ASHLEY: I did hear that you've been calling
yourselves something? I hear a name floating

02:30:50.953 --> 02:30:55.950
around, that you're calling yourselves the Mighty
Nein?

02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:57.147
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:30:57.147 --> 02:30:58.948
MARISHA: We are getting a reputation!

02:30:58.948 --> 02:31:03.158
TALIESIN: Word of mouth. You don't need a big,
public thing.

02:31:03.158 --> 02:31:05.372
TRAVIS: Not too much, Caleb. It's all right. Not
too much.

02:31:05.372 --> 02:31:06.916
LIAM: How many people have you heard that from?

02:31:06.916 --> 02:31:08.574
ASHLEY: Three and a half.

02:31:09.924 --> 02:31:11.469
TRAVIS: That's less than a handful.

02:31:11.469 --> 02:31:12.678
TALIESIN: Three and one dead.

02:31:12.678 --> 02:31:14.536
TRAVIS: Not even worth mentioning at all.

02:31:14.536 --> 02:31:15.768
LIAM: In a handful of days.

02:31:17.218 --> 02:31:18.366
ASHLEY: In a handful of days.

02:31:18.366 --> 02:31:23.545
SAM: And is our reputation intimidating?
Threatening?

02:31:26.045 --> 02:31:36.761
ASHLEY: It's neither here nor there, but just for
clarification, is it Nine, as the number nine--

02:31:36.761 --> 02:31:38.346
SAM: Yes. It's the number nine.

02:31:38.346 --> 02:31:40.381
TRAVIS: Actually, that's not correct.

02:31:40.381 --> 02:31:41.432
LAURA: So we still need a few people left.

02:31:41.432 --> 02:31:41.977
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:31:41.977 --> 02:31:44.199
TALIESIN: It's going to be very hard to search for
us if they don't know if it's Nine or Nein.

02:31:44.199 --> 02:31:46.200
SAM: No, it's Nine, the number nine.

02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:48.783
MARISHA: It's deliberately con-- are they looking
for nine people?

02:31:48.783 --> 02:31:49.651
SAM: That's right.

02:31:49.651 --> 02:31:51.048
ASHLEY: You look different.

02:31:51.048 --> 02:31:52.260
TRAVIS: I thought it was "no."

02:31:54.450 --> 02:31:59.156
LIAM: Yes. I have been in this bath for a few
minutes. No, you were here when I got here. That's

02:31:59.156 --> 02:32:07.451
true. We visited an arcane shop and the
gentle...men? I'm not sure, really. The

02:32:07.997 --> 02:32:12.992
proprietors of the shop did a little <i>dippity doo</i>
to me and it just took everything away.

02:32:12.992 --> 02:32:14.733
LAURA: Did you know there's a spell that can do
that?

02:32:14.733 --> 02:32:20.002
ASHLEY: No. I actually don't know much about
spells and things.

02:32:20.002 --> 02:32:23.832
LIAM: Yeah, he gave me the carwash. Took it all
away.

02:32:23.832 --> 02:32:25.353
ASHLEY: Nice.

02:32:26.443 --> 02:32:28.559
MARISHA: That's something different from where I
come from.

02:32:28.559 --> 02:32:34.943
LIAM: Yeah, I don't like this. I start sinking
into the bath, enveloping everything, and sitting

02:32:34.943 --> 02:32:36.749
on the bottom and holding my breath for a little
while.

02:32:36.749 --> 02:32:41.134
TRAVIS: Well, we've lost Caleb. Should we discuss
the potential job offers that we've collected?

02:32:41.134 --> 02:32:44.441
TALIESIN: Also, if we're going to get him back, we
going to have to have an agreement about the fact

02:32:44.441 --> 02:32:48.059
that, while there's going to be a certain amount
of advertising necessary for this kind of venture,

02:32:48.059 --> 02:32:55.511
there are many of us-- and I think it's fair to
say-- that want to keep things quiet. As quiet as possible.

02:32:55.511 --> 02:32:58.384
TRAVIS: I agree. I am also not looking to attract
any attention.

02:32:59.124 --> 02:33:04.747
MATT: (clapping) You hear this four series of
quick snapping claps, and you hear, "Heat it up!"

02:33:04.747 --> 02:33:10.501
You hear the voice of Miss Rima from within, and
you watch as two side doors open. These small

02:33:10.501 --> 02:33:16.424
troops of women and men come through with these
pots of heated water, and then dump them into the

02:33:16.424 --> 02:33:20.344
bath to refresh the heat, and then exit again and
then close the doors behind them.

02:33:20.344 --> 02:33:21.079
TALIESIN: Bless you!

02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:23.371
LIAM: Oh, it's hot down there on the ears!

02:33:23.371 --> 02:33:26.017
MARISHA: Yeah. I wasn't going to tell you.

02:33:27.717 --> 02:33:29.467
SAM: I'm not in the water.

02:33:29.467 --> 02:33:30.430
LAURA: You're not getting in the water?

02:33:30.430 --> 02:33:31.036
SAM: Nope.

02:33:31.036 --> 02:33:33.022
LAURA: You're just standing off to the side,
Nott?

02:33:33.022 --> 02:33:33.468
SAM: Yep.

02:33:33.468 --> 02:33:34.777
LAURA: But you're naked.

02:33:35.717 --> 02:33:36.770
SAM: Possibly, yes.

02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:39.043
LAURA: You're ready to come in. Come into the--

02:33:39.043 --> 02:33:40.668
ASHLEY: Have you been in the water at all?

02:33:40.668 --> 02:33:44.238
SAM: No, I'd prefer not to.

02:33:44.498 --> 02:33:46.776
ASHLEY: Do you not like going into the water?

02:33:46.776 --> 02:33:47.587
SAM: No, thank you.

02:33:47.587 --> 02:33:49.082
LAURA: What is it about it?

02:33:49.082 --> 02:33:53.995
SAM: It's creepy. It's dangerous in there. It can
drown a person.

02:33:53.995 --> 02:33:59.963
MARISHA: So wait. You're creeped out by water and
you're creeped out by fire? Man, covering the

02:33:59.963 --> 02:34:03.169
spectrums. Yeah.

02:34:03.169 --> 02:34:04.072
LAURA: Yeah.

02:34:04.892 --> 02:34:07.524
ASHLEY: Nott, do you know how to swim?

02:34:07.524 --> 02:34:10.234
SAM: I don't know. I haven't tried in a while.

02:34:10.234 --> 02:34:12.209
TRAVIS: Well, we can certainly teach you.

02:34:12.209 --> 02:34:13.739
ASHLEY: We could hold you.

02:34:13.739 --> 02:34:16.995
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's very shallow here. Very little
risk.

02:34:16.995 --> 02:34:19.815
TALIESIN: My father just threw me right in. That's
how I learned.

02:34:19.815 --> 02:34:21.106
MARISHA: You know, that's actually--

02:34:21.106 --> 02:34:22.573
TRAVIS: We're not going to do that.

02:34:22.573 --> 02:34:23.563
TALIESIN: No, that's a terrible idea.

02:34:23.563 --> 02:34:25.066
SAM: No, that sounds terrifying and horrible!

02:34:25.066 --> 02:34:26.526
TALIESIN: It was awful, but here we are.

02:34:26.526 --> 02:34:29.106
LIAM: I could hold you and you could do the dog
paddle. Have you ever seen the dog paddle before?

02:34:29.106 --> 02:34:32.856
SAM: I mean, it seems dangerous, though. How do
you breathe in there?

02:34:32.856 --> 02:34:34.048
MARISHA: Well, you keep your head above water.

02:34:34.048 --> 02:34:35.080
LIAM: Well, you know.

02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:43.333
MARISHA: Here, I take Nott and I say, hold my
hands. Just hold my hands. Okay, ready? And I pull

02:34:43.333 --> 02:34:50.952
Nott into the water and I go: Now kick kick kick!
There you go! Kick kick kick! Keep kicking! Keep

02:34:50.952 --> 02:34:55.275
kicking! Good job! And I put her back on the
edge.

02:34:55.275 --> 02:34:57.486
SAM: (coughing) It got in my nose!

02:34:57.486 --> 02:34:58.664
TALIESIN: Wow, that brought it back.

02:34:58.664 --> 02:34:59.842
TRAVIS: She vomits up a popsicle into the pool.

02:34:59.842 --> 02:35:01.204
MARISHA: It's okay. See?

02:35:06.184 --> 02:35:07.262
LAURA: See? How did it feel?

02:35:08.492 --> 02:35:09.583
SAM: It wasn't terrible.

02:35:09.583 --> 02:35:12.224
LIAM: Does the little Fjord look wet or dry?

02:35:12.224 --> 02:35:16.686
MATT: Looks dry. But leaving a trail of water
behind.

02:35:16.686 --> 02:35:18.030
LIAM: I love magic so much.

02:35:18.030 --> 02:35:19.082
SAM: It's not bad.

02:35:19.712 --> 02:35:22.484
LAURA: Are the old couple looking at us like we're
weird?

02:35:22.484 --> 02:35:27.679
MATT: Yes. They're both off, holding each other,
just going.

02:35:27.679 --> 02:35:30.856
LIAM: Hey, they're all about to start having sex.
You might want to get out of here.

02:35:30.856 --> 02:35:34.151
MATT: They immediately get up and start leaving
into the changing room, exiting the chamber.

02:35:34.151 --> 02:35:36.735
LAURA: Is there anyone else in this pool with us?

02:35:36.735 --> 02:35:37.576
MATT: At the moment, no.

02:35:37.576 --> 02:35:38.137
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:35:38.137 --> 02:35:40.795
LAURA: Yeah! It's all ours! It's a party room
now!

02:35:40.795 --> 02:35:42.442
TALIESIN: I don't think they understood that was
an invitation.

02:35:43.462 --> 02:35:48.506
TRAVIS: So here's what we got. We got "gold from
'My-riad' activity?"

02:35:50.716 --> 02:35:51.398
LAURA: Myriad.

02:35:51.398 --> 02:35:53.734
TRAVIS: Myriad activity. Whatever that is.

02:35:53.734 --> 02:35:54.419
TALIESIN: That's exciting.

02:35:54.419 --> 02:36:01.276
TRAVIS: We got "reward for rebel gatherings."
Which we are not going to do. We've got "tracking

02:36:01.276 --> 02:36:04.678
down heretical god worship." I don't think we're
feeling that one, right?

02:36:04.678 --> 02:36:05.718
LIAM: With this one?

02:36:05.718 --> 02:36:07.610
LAURA: Probably a bad thing to do!

02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:17.126
SAM: Do you have a god that you worship? Because
we've just been told that's it's bad juju around here.

02:36:17.126 --> 02:36:20.107
TRAVIS: Yeah. Apparently there are only six
deities they allow to be worshipped publicly here.

02:36:20.107 --> 02:36:22.113
ASHLEY: What are the six deities?

02:36:22.113 --> 02:36:25.179
TRAVIS: The Allhammer, the Raven Queen, the--

02:36:25.179 --> 02:36:26.723
LAURA: Platinum Dragon.

02:36:26.723 --> 02:36:30.572
SAM: The Dawnfather, the Annoying Mistress?

02:36:30.572 --> 02:36:31.616
MATT: The Knowing Mis--

02:36:31.616 --> 02:36:36.213
(laughter)

02:36:36.213 --> 02:36:38.092
MATT: That's a different pantheon all together.

02:36:39.232 --> 02:36:44.099
MARISHA: What was it? The Dawnfather, the Raven
Queen, the Knowing Mistress, the Allhammer--

02:36:44.099 --> 02:36:45.863
MATT: The Lawbearer.

02:36:45.863 --> 02:36:47.277
MARISHA: The Lawbearer!

02:36:47.277 --> 02:36:52.155
LIAM: Do you have any sort of religion or
tradition of heavy metal or something?

02:36:54.865 --> 02:36:56.223
ASHLEY: Yes, I do.

02:36:59.213 --> 02:37:00.583
SAM: Are you in the clear?

02:37:01.423 --> 02:37:02.321
ASHLEY: Not here.

02:37:02.321 --> 02:37:05.859
LAURA: (gasps) Do you worship the Traveler too?

02:37:05.859 --> 02:37:07.459
ASHLEY: I do not.

02:37:07.459 --> 02:37:10.732
LAURA: Oh, okay. I thought I would have known you
if you did.

02:37:10.732 --> 02:37:11.299
ASHLEY: Probably.

02:37:11.299 --> 02:37:14.559
LAURA: We have really small group meetings. It's
usually just me.

02:37:14.559 --> 02:37:26.291
ASHLEY: Oh. He sounds like a great-- so many
adventures. With traveling and with him.

02:37:26.491 --> 02:37:27.438
LAURA: What about you?

02:37:32.238 --> 02:37:39.468
ASHLEY: Well, I don't feel like I'm comfortable to
say here--

02:37:39.468 --> 02:37:40.962
SAM: We can see your vagina.

02:37:40.962 --> 02:37:43.899
LAURA: Yeah, you don't have anything to hide from
us.

02:37:43.899 --> 02:37:45.376
ASHLEY: I mean, it's underwater, but--

02:37:45.376 --> 02:37:46.315
SAM: So we're all comfortable.

02:37:46.315 --> 02:37:50.080
TALIESIN: One assumes there's a mist that's just
covering everything--

02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:52.708
MATT: It obscures it to the point where, yeah.

02:37:54.998 --> 02:37:56.437
ASHLEY: You stand up and it's still like--

02:37:58.477 --> 02:38:01.891
TALIESIN: I mean, nudity's going great and all,
but this is more about comfortability.

02:38:01.891 --> 02:38:05.691
LIAM: As a victim of Campaign One: yes, there has
to be.

02:38:07.701 --> 02:38:09.054
LAURA: Everything is a milk bath.

02:38:09.054 --> 02:38:10.309
TALIESIN: Thank you!

02:38:11.499 --> 02:38:13.033
LIAM: That's not milk!

02:38:15.193 --> 02:38:23.076
TRAVIS: We also got, apparently, Winestacker. Wang
stacker? Yeah, he had something, at the Morrow Keep?

02:38:23.076 --> 02:38:25.610
LAURA: He wanted people to join the military, so
no.

02:38:25.610 --> 02:38:30.003
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not going to do that. But
there is a roving beast, which feel like falls

02:38:30.003 --> 02:38:30.938
into our wheelhouse.

02:38:31.938 --> 02:38:33.994
LAURA: I like killing roving beasts.

02:38:33.994 --> 02:38:37.511
TALIESIN: I don't know what a wheelhouse is, but I
feel pretty positive about the metaphor in general.

02:38:37.511 --> 02:38:43.978
LAURA: Nott, do you want me to wash your hair for
you? No one will see. Because you look like Fjord.

02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:46.168
SAM: All right, that'll be nice!

02:38:46.168 --> 02:38:52.726
TRAVIS: If you're not planning on bouncing <i>tout
suite</i>, might be a fair way to find our way in the town.

02:38:53.762 --> 02:39:00.370
ASHLEY: Sometimes I have to go, but I like killing
things, so sign me up.

02:39:00.966 --> 02:39:02.034
TALIESIN: My god, the money.

02:39:02.034 --> 02:39:03.477
ASHLEY: And my god, the money.

02:39:03.477 --> 02:39:04.998
TALIESIN: I've never seen anything like it.

02:39:04.998 --> 02:39:06.804
LAURA: We made so much money off of ears!

02:39:06.804 --> 02:39:07.854
TRAVIS: Yep, we really did.

02:39:07.854 --> 02:39:08.606
ASHLEY: Just ears alone?

02:39:08.606 --> 02:39:10.242
TALIESIN: Three months' worth of shows, like
that!

02:39:10.242 --> 02:39:10.871
ASHLEY: Wow.

02:39:10.871 --> 02:39:12.907
MARISHA: The Crownsguard have so much money.

02:39:12.907 --> 02:39:15.135
TALIESIN: And they're so lazy!

02:39:15.135 --> 02:39:20.076
LAURA: And we're going to make a whole lot of
gold over at the Pillow Trove.

02:39:20.076 --> 02:39:22.110
ASHLEY: What is the Pillow Trove?

02:39:22.619 --> 02:39:25.120
LAURA: It's a fancy hotel place.

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:28.274
TRAVIS: Apparently Jester's mother's going to hook
it up, right?

02:39:28.274 --> 02:39:28.884
LAURA: Mm-hmm!

02:39:28.884 --> 02:39:30.217
ASHLEY: Who's your mother?

02:39:30.217 --> 02:39:32.022
LAURA: She's the Ruby of the Sea.

02:39:32.022 --> 02:39:34.780
ASHLEY: I feel like I've heard of the Ruby of the
Sea.

02:39:38.260 --> 02:39:41.482
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: [whisper inaudibly]

02:39:41.482 --> 02:39:46.264
ASHLEY: Okay, I have heard of the Ruby of the Sea.
That's pretty spectacular that that's your mother.

02:39:46.264 --> 02:39:47.252
LAURA: I know!

02:39:47.252 --> 02:39:48.802
MARISHA: She has her own jingle.

02:39:51.252 --> 02:39:58.732
SAM: How does that go again? (singing) Everybody
knows the Ruby of the Sea!

02:40:00.742 --> 02:40:03.250
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (singing) The best lay
around!

02:40:05.470 --> 02:40:08.608
LAURA: You guys have really bad memories because
it was not like this at all.

02:40:08.608 --> 02:40:14.388
TRAVIS: Hey, Nott, now the next step is to get
your head underwater. Okay, we're going to take a

02:40:14.388 --> 02:40:14.953
big breath.

02:40:15.433 --> 02:40:18.304
LAURA: I've been sudsing up your hair. You have to
do it to dunk your hair.

02:40:18.304 --> 02:40:19.626
SAM: To wash my hair?

02:40:19.626 --> 02:40:22.897
TRAVIS: Beau and I will hold you, and on the count
of three, we're going to go under.

02:40:22.897 --> 02:40:25.550
TRAVIS and MARISHA: One, and a two, and a three!

02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:28.376
TRAVIS: We all go underwater with Nott.

02:40:28.376 --> 02:40:30.831
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and SAM: (bubbling)

02:40:30.831 --> 02:40:32.443
TRAVIS: And we bring him back up.

02:40:32.443 --> 02:40:35.288
SAM: (gasping) I'll kill you all! I'll kill every
motherfucking one!

02:40:37.518 --> 02:40:39.011
TRAVIS: (shushing)

02:40:39.011 --> 02:40:41.438
LIAM: He's done, you are with friends.

02:40:41.438 --> 02:40:47.178
TRAVIS: Hey, you did great! You did great. You're
going to get a sticker.

02:40:48.478 --> 02:40:54.808
MARISHA: A sucker, at the end of this. From
Jester, not from me, but you'll get a sucker.

02:40:54.808 --> 02:40:57.091
TRAVIS: It didn't burn, right? You lived. Great
job.

02:40:57.091 --> 02:40:57.680
SAM: Thank you.

02:40:57.680 --> 02:40:59.840
ASHLEY: How do you feel now? Are you still
scared?

02:41:00.730 --> 02:41:08.211
SAM: I'm less scared, but it's still
uncomfortable, and I'd prefer to do it at my own

02:41:08.211 --> 02:41:09.963
speed, thank you very much.

02:41:11.213 --> 02:41:14.521
ASHLEY: Do you want to stand at the side then, and
hold the side?

02:41:15.251 --> 02:41:18.475
SAM: Hold the side, like this? Yes.

02:41:24.475 --> 02:41:32.472
LIAM: Yasha, there's a heavier presence of the
Empire here than there was in Trostenwald. How

02:41:32.472 --> 02:41:33.481
does that sit with you?

02:41:36.221 --> 02:41:46.005
ASHLEY: Well, I know I have to be careful about
some certain things. I think I'll be fine.

02:41:47.495 --> 02:41:51.691
TRAVIS: Nobody's chasing after you or giving you
any heat, are they?

02:41:51.691 --> 02:41:52.249
ASHLEY: No.

02:41:52.249 --> 02:41:53.125
LIAM: Insight check.

02:41:57.485 --> 02:42:00.785
TRAVIS: Which one? I am lying!

02:42:02.495 --> 02:42:05.947
MATT: Generally you can say, "Do I believe her?"
and then I'll tell you to make an insight check.

02:42:05.947 --> 02:42:10.264
LIAM: Okay. Do I believe her? I do! Okay.

02:42:16.494 --> 02:42:24.761
ASHLEY: I'm not in trouble for anything. I think,
if anything, it would be because of the god I've

02:42:24.761 --> 02:42:25.589
chosen to follow.

02:42:25.589 --> 02:42:27.352
LAURA: Which is whom?

02:42:27.352 --> 02:42:27.880
TRAVIS: Jester!

02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.200
ASHLEY: It's the Stormlord. I don't know if you
know of him.

02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:39.621
SAM: Do any of us know what the Stormlord is?

02:42:41.481 --> 02:42:45.080
MATT: Yeah. For basic religion, you would, because
you've been outside the Empire. Those of you who

02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:48.686
grew up in the Empire, you would vaguely have an
idea.

02:42:48.686 --> 02:42:49.960
LIAM: What about a big reader?

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:51.657
MATT: You would, maybe. Make a religion check.

02:42:52.687 --> 02:42:53.557
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:42:55.197 --> 02:43:01.655
MATT: You are very aware of the Stormlord. You
knew the Stormlord well. Since the Menagerie Coast

02:43:01.655 --> 02:43:07.992
largely relies on port trade, it is one of the
most-worshipped gods in the Menagerie Coast for

02:43:07.992 --> 02:43:14.422
people who travel in and out of the ports there.
Overseas, safe passage amongst bodies of water,

02:43:14.422 --> 02:43:20.575
contests of strength, proving worth through
action. Lot of very interesting elements that the

02:43:20.575 --> 02:43:23.800
two of you would know of that following.

02:43:24.210 --> 02:43:27.304
TRAVIS: I understand the Stormlord is to be feared
and respected.

02:43:27.304 --> 02:43:39.241
ASHLEY: Yes, he's pulled me out of what literally
felt like the depths of hell, so I owe him my

02:43:39.241 --> 02:43:49.578
life. I will continue to serve him and do as he
asks, whenever he asks.

02:43:49.578 --> 02:43:52.137
LAURA: Are you from the Menagerie Coast as well?

02:43:52.857 --> 02:43:53.549
ASHLEY: No.

02:43:53.549 --> 02:43:55.602
LAURA: Are you from the empire?

02:43:56.222 --> 02:43:56.897
ASHLEY: No.

02:43:58.237 --> 02:43:59.552
SAM: Where are you from?!

02:43:59.552 --> 02:44:03.254
(laughter)

02:44:03.254 --> 02:44:07.019
LAURA: Sorry, Yasha. This is a lot. If you don't
want to answer, I understand.

02:44:07.019 --> 02:44:10.272
LIAM: Yeah, you just joined back up with us. She
doesn't need to tell us her life story.

02:44:10.722 --> 02:44:13.244
MARISHA: When you say "pulled you from hell,"
though--

02:44:13.244 --> 02:44:14.397
TRAVIS: Wow, Beau. Really?

02:44:14.397 --> 02:44:17.422
MARISHA: What? She brought it up.

02:44:17.422 --> 02:44:20.530
LIAM: You are literally undercutting the very
thing I just said.

02:44:20.530 --> 02:44:22.784
TRAVIS: We are very glad that you're back.

02:44:22.784 --> 02:44:24.659
TALIESIN: I vouch for her, for what it's worth.

02:44:24.659 --> 02:44:26.294
TRAVIS: Which means a lot, Molly.

02:44:26.294 --> 02:44:27.720
TALIESIN: It means what it means.

02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:29.203
LAURA: I trust her fully.

02:44:31.233 --> 02:44:36.071
TRAVIS: Molly, what else do you do around a hot
bath-spa-place?

02:44:36.071 --> 02:44:39.794
TALIESIN: You run into your friends who are also
heading in odd directions.

02:44:39.794 --> 02:44:44.610
LAURA: You stand uncomfortably close to people you
know and make them feel awkward. And I walk really

02:44:44.610 --> 02:44:45.822
close to you, Fjord.

02:44:49.232 --> 02:44:52.834
TALIESIN: I tend to find it's easier to look into
somebody's eyes and figure out if they're lying to

02:44:52.834 --> 02:44:55.994
you if they're naked and boiling.

02:44:55.994 --> 02:45:07.597
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. Jester-- I forgot what I was going
to say.

02:45:09.247 --> 02:45:14.406
MARISHA: Yasha, it's interesting to see you
without your cloak. You were super adamant about

02:45:14.406 --> 02:45:14.980
that one.

02:45:16.890 --> 02:45:17.767
ASHLEY: I was cold.

02:45:17.767 --> 02:45:21.805
MARISHA: Sure. Hot tub, you know.

02:45:22.455 --> 02:45:25.379
ASHLEY: I recall when you asked for it, it was a
very cold day.

02:45:29.229 --> 02:45:34.463
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Do you need a towel? Do you need
me to get the hard-to-reach places in your back or

02:45:34.463 --> 02:45:35.689
anything for you, while we're here?

02:45:35.689 --> 02:45:36.628
ASHLEY: I got it.

02:45:36.628 --> 02:45:40.038
TALIESIN: I like to think you're scratching--
You've got a sword in your hand, for god's sake.

02:45:40.038 --> 02:45:41.575
TRAVIS: This is normal, right?

02:45:41.575 --> 02:45:43.194
ASHLEY: You pay extra to keep your weapons.

02:45:44.244 --> 02:45:46.612
SAM: You've been in the water before, haven't
you?

02:45:46.612 --> 02:45:50.475
TRAVIS: No, I know, it just seems to be happening
faster than before. It's all fragrant and stuff.

02:45:50.475 --> 02:45:53.211
LAURA: Oh no, Fjord! Are you melting?!

02:45:53.211 --> 02:45:54.552
SAM: He's turning into a fish!

02:45:54.552 --> 02:45:56.754
LAURA: Oh no, you're turning into water!

02:45:56.754 --> 02:46:03.940
TRAVIS: Oh no, oh no. Jester, help. (fake drowning
noises)

02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:08.913
LIAM: Five or six days in, I think, and I'm really
questioning this decision.

02:46:12.463 --> 02:46:15.574
SAM: Should we take the mission to go kill the big
beast?

02:46:15.974 --> 02:46:16.859
TRAVIS: I think so.

02:46:16.859 --> 02:46:23.026
TALIESIN: I say we take the beast. Again, keep it
on the down-low. We'll figure out a way of getting

02:46:23.026 --> 02:46:29.093
credit and keeping our reputation, but keeping it
quiet.

02:46:29.093 --> 02:46:30.939
MARISHA and LAURA: Okay.

02:46:33.179 --> 02:46:34.761
TRAVIS: We take it to the Herald of the Hall.

02:46:34.761 --> 02:46:35.633
LAURA: Yes.

02:46:35.633 --> 02:46:37.525
TALIESIN: God, I hope his name is Harold.

02:46:37.525 --> 02:46:47.398
MARISHA: You guys know how Shakäste was all like
(shushing) and secret, you know?

02:46:47.398 --> 02:46:48.864
LAURA: Is that what he was like?

02:46:48.864 --> 02:46:51.827
MARISHA: Yeah, he was all like, "I'm mysterious."

02:46:51.827 --> 02:46:55.791
TRAVIS: We met a guy named Shakäste, he was super
cool. White afro, really awesome.

02:46:55.791 --> 02:46:57.274
MARISHA: Have you heard of him?

02:46:57.274 --> 02:46:58.198
LIAM: Totally blind.

02:46:58.198 --> 02:47:02.478
MARISHA: Everywhere he went, he was like,
(shushing). He was super badass.

02:47:02.478 --> 02:47:03.471
TRAVIS: He said "baby" a lot.

02:47:03.471 --> 02:47:04.331
LAURA: He called us "baby."

02:47:04.331 --> 02:47:06.261
ASHLEY: He called you a baby a lot?

02:47:06.261 --> 02:47:07.920
TRAVIS: But in a charming way.

02:47:08.930 --> 02:47:15.748
MARISHA: I was into it, I didn't feel demeaned by
it. It makes me feel good, makes me feel safe.

02:47:15.748 --> 02:47:17.521
TALIESIN: I felt demeaned, but in a good way.

02:47:18.731 --> 02:47:20.379
MARISHA: I'm just saying, maybe we can--

02:47:20.379 --> 02:47:22.550
MARISHA and LAURA: Be like that.

02:47:24.700 --> 02:47:28.258
LAURA: I get out and I start drying my hair and
try to get pretty.

02:47:28.888 --> 02:47:29.850
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're up.

02:47:30.430 --> 02:47:34.846
MATT: You guys start making your way out of the
bath, gathering your clothing once more, as you

02:47:34.846 --> 02:47:35.400
head back.

02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:37.143
TRAVIS: I gather my clothing away from Jester.

02:47:37.143 --> 02:47:41.523
LIAM: Is this one still in disguise? Nott, are you
still in disguise?

02:47:41.523 --> 02:47:42.817
SAM: How long has it been?

02:47:42.817 --> 02:47:44.541
LIAM: It's an hour, that it takes.

02:47:47.181 --> 02:47:51.516
MATT: You've been in here, catching up and soaking
for about a half an hour, 40 minutes, so you're

02:47:51.516 --> 02:47:52.647
getting pretty close to losing.

02:47:52.647 --> 02:47:57.366
SAM: I wrap a towel around myself, and then I'll
drop form.

02:47:57.366 --> 02:47:58.542
TRAVIS: Come on, "son."

02:47:59.922 --> 02:48:06.938
MATT: You now see the towel-covered, goblinoid
form of Nott, her hair wet and tattered down

02:48:06.938 --> 02:48:10.931
across the face. It's long in the front, the
yellow eyes peeking through.

02:48:11.721 --> 02:48:14.984
LIAM: Are our clothes in here, or somewhere else?

02:48:14.984 --> 02:48:16.822
LAURA: They probably folded them up for us.

02:48:16.822 --> 02:48:19.140
LIAM: But I didn't send mine off to be cleaned.

02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:20.560
TALIESIN: Then yours was in a locker.

02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:25.221
LIAM: I'm going to pull the spool of silver thread
and I'll take a length of it out, and I'm going to

02:48:25.221 --> 02:48:28.379
pull Nott's hair back and do a little ponytail.
Simple.

02:48:30.509 --> 02:48:32.029
ASHLEY: I'm going to wait until everyone gets
out.

02:48:32.739 --> 02:48:37.970
MARISHA: Damn it. I was going to say, I wait and
watch all my friends get out.

02:48:37.970 --> 02:48:40.758
TRAVIS: You all just sit on opposite sides.

02:48:43.458 --> 02:48:44.401
SAM: You guys coming?

02:48:44.401 --> 02:48:45.615
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:48:45.615 --> 02:48:49.147
ASHLEY: Yeah, I just want to make sure that I get
my full time's worth.

02:48:49.147 --> 02:48:51.068
MARISHA: Yeah, we paid a lot for this.

02:48:53.498 --> 02:48:56.409
TRAVIS: Should we catch you outside, then?

02:48:57.049 --> 02:48:57.973
MARISHA: No, it's good.

02:49:00.223 --> 02:49:01.677
TALIESIN: It's a really hot hot tub.

02:49:03.487 --> 02:49:06.525
LIAM: I think the moment's passed for the rest of
us. I think we should go.

02:49:06.525 --> 02:49:07.653
SAM: We'll just go.

02:49:07.653 --> 02:49:09.907
TRAVIS: Maybe they need more hot water, we'll send
some in on our way out.

02:49:11.227 --> 02:49:12.884
LIAM: Have fun storming the castle.

02:49:13.464 --> 02:49:18.113
MATT: The clean clothing is presented. You guys
get dressed and your outfits are waiting for you

02:49:18.113 --> 02:49:19.896
in the dressing room.

02:49:23.226 --> 02:49:24.769
TALIESIN: I'm ready for Monster Hunter.

02:49:24.769 --> 02:49:26.092
LAURA: Who gives up first?

02:49:26.092 --> 02:49:28.160
TRAVIS: I'm real down for that showdown.

02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:29.439
MARISHA: We're in hot tub chicken right now.

02:49:31.229 --> 02:49:33.332
ASHLEY: I mean, I don't care to show anything.

02:49:34.012 --> 02:49:34.531
MARISHA: No?

02:49:37.461 --> 02:49:41.397
ASHLEY: I feel like this is a pool of honesty. I
just wanted to see everybody else naked first.

02:49:41.397 --> 02:49:44.230
MARISHA: Yeah, it's honestly kind of my thing.

02:49:44.230 --> 02:49:46.370
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm getting out.

02:49:46.370 --> 02:49:48.159
LIAM: And the water drops a foot and a half.

02:49:48.159 --> 02:49:52.367
(laughter)

02:49:52.367 --> 02:49:57.003
MATT: It's fun to watch her make her way out using
the large greatsword essentially as a walking

02:49:57.003 --> 02:50:00.617
stick as she emerges from the tub.

02:50:00.617 --> 02:50:01.906
MARISHA: Do I get a nice view?

02:50:04.216 --> 02:50:05.067
MATT and ASHLEY: Yes.

02:50:05.067 --> 02:50:06.978
SAM: Roll for perv.

02:50:08.468 --> 02:50:10.169
TRAVIS: Perving on Yasha.

02:50:14.229 --> 02:50:15.755
MARISHA: And now I get out, yeah.

02:50:16.475 --> 02:50:17.226
TALIESIN: Backflip.

02:50:19.436 --> 02:50:20.277
MARISHA: Three-point landing.

02:50:23.467 --> 02:50:30.319
MATT: You guys have regathered your materials.
You've reconvened outside the Steam's Respite.

02:50:30.319 --> 02:50:35.524
It's about midday now, about noon-ish. The rest of
the day is still yours. What do you wish to do?

02:50:35.524 --> 02:50:38.812
TALIESIN: Let's find a herald. The maudlin
herald.

02:50:38.812 --> 02:50:41.284
LAURA: While you guys do that, I need to go to The
Pillow Trove, okay?

02:50:41.284 --> 02:50:42.504
LIAM: Where are you going?

02:50:42.504 --> 02:50:48.073
LAURA: I need to go to The Pillow Trove, which is
the nice tavern in the place.

02:50:48.073 --> 02:50:52.379
LIAM: Would you mind, I don't want to go in, but
would you mind if I tagged along with you?

02:50:52.379 --> 02:50:53.625
LAURA: No, that's fine.

02:50:53.625 --> 02:50:56.683
TRAVIS: Will you be gone for a while, or is it a
quick errand?

02:50:56.683 --> 02:50:59.792
LAURA: It's a quick errand. I just need to pop in
and pop out, you know how you do.

02:50:59.792 --> 02:51:01.969
TRAVIS: We'll see you back over here, then? Okay.

02:51:03.229 --> 02:51:07.744
LIAM: Nott, did you want to stick with the others?
I'm going to run an errand with Jester.

02:51:07.744 --> 02:51:08.825
SAM: Do you need me?

02:51:10.205 --> 02:51:12.830
LIAM: Not for this. I should just be gone a couple
of hours.

02:51:12.830 --> 02:51:16.221
SAM: Do you need health potions, because you might
die?

02:51:18.251 --> 02:51:19.866
LIAM: I think chances are very low.

02:51:19.866 --> 02:51:21.212
SAM: Do you have one?

02:51:21.212 --> 02:51:23.576
LIAM: Yeah, I have the one you secured for me,
yeah.

02:51:23.576 --> 02:51:24.386
SAM: Okay, good.

02:51:24.386 --> 02:51:27.803
TALIESIN: Come on, Nott, it'll be fine. We'll see
if we can meet anybody else who you could make

02:51:27.803 --> 02:51:29.236
feel better about who they are.

02:51:29.236 --> 02:51:32.090
LIAM: Go have fun. Maybe you get another button or
two from a grumpy person.

02:51:32.090 --> 02:51:32.692
SAM: Excellent.

02:51:34.212 --> 02:51:38.180
LAURA: Before we leave, I run up and give Yasha a
hug, and say: I'm glad you're back.

02:51:38.180 --> 02:51:48.566
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you, Jester. I get
uncomfortable. I don't hug her back, but I gently

02:51:48.566 --> 02:51:50.479
give her one pat.

02:51:52.479 --> 02:51:56.290
LIAM: Caleb sees this, and just goes--

02:51:57.660 --> 02:51:59.810
TRAVIS: Hug around the arms that are down, and
you're like--

02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:02.851
MATT: Perfect.

02:52:03.671 --> 02:52:06.998
ASHLEY: I'm trying. I'm very uncomfortable with
human touch.

02:52:06.998 --> 02:52:08.636
LIAM: I feel like I know you better now.

02:52:09.666 --> 02:52:11.606
TRAVIS: We'll see you back at the King's Hall.

02:52:11.606 --> 02:52:12.577
LAURA: Okie-dokie.

02:52:15.497 --> 02:52:18.813
MATT: Those of you heading to the King's Hall, you
make your way back to the familiar outside, this

02:52:18.813 --> 02:52:30.904
large center for law, order, and judgement within
the city of Zadash. As you approach the doorways,

02:52:30.904 --> 02:52:37.242
the guards pass, but keep an eye very closely as
you enter. On the interior, you can see there are

02:52:37.242 --> 02:52:45.354
two round tables with curved benches that meet the
sides of it, and there you can see some of the

02:52:45.354 --> 02:52:50.207
crownsguard in the process of talking to various
civilians and taking notes. There's conversation

02:52:50.207 --> 02:52:54.100
about-- pardon me. So?

02:52:54.100 --> 02:52:58.521
TRAVIS: Is there a desk, or a clerk?

02:52:59.231 --> 02:53:02.120
MATT: You don't see a desk or a clerk, but you do
see the crownsguard that are currently at the

02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:05.679
tables, talking to these individuals, and you see
two other individual crownsguards that are

02:53:05.679 --> 02:53:11.285
standing and guarding two hallway entrances that
lead further into the King's Hall.

02:53:11.285 --> 02:53:17.258
MARISHA: As we walk up, I'm going to take my robe,
and for the first time any time this party has

02:53:17.258 --> 02:53:22.860
seen, cross it over and tie it more
traditionally.

02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:29.515
TRAVIS: I'll walk up to one of the king's guard,
ask him. We're here to inquire about one of the

02:53:29.515 --> 02:53:34.193
postings. There's a roving beast that needs taking
care of.

02:53:35.223 --> 02:53:41.248
MATT: "Oh, let me go and get the Herald for you,
hold on just a second." He scoots out of the next

02:53:41.248 --> 02:53:51.622
hallway. A few moments later, you watch as this
really stressed-looking male dwarf with these

02:53:51.622 --> 02:53:59.286
thick mutton chops and salt-and-pepper hair,
well-groomed, combed really heavily to one side,

02:53:59.286 --> 02:54:03.142
the thick hair is being tamed to the point where,
in a very Gene Wilder way, it's combed and then

02:54:03.142 --> 02:54:12.127
(poof), out one side. As he walks in, he's wearing
long robes of gold and white and silver, and

02:54:12.127 --> 02:54:18.267
carries the holy symbol of the Lawbearer. You can
see an axe that hangs on a chain with a scale

02:54:18.267 --> 02:54:30.910
embedded in the center of it. He walks in. "Right.
So you're inquiring about the job board?"

02:54:30.910 --> 02:54:36.030
TRAVIS: That's right. We're a few members of the
group known as the Mighty Nein. We would like to

02:54:36.030 --> 02:54:38.572
take one of those listings off your hand, if we
could.

02:54:38.572 --> 02:54:41.479
MATT: "All right. Which one in the task board you
looking for?"

02:54:41.479 --> 02:54:45.632
TRAVIS: The one mentioning that roving beast.
Seems about our speed.

02:54:46.492 --> 02:54:53.822
MATT: He gives a quick glance over all of you.
"All right. Let me go ahead and pull this out." He

02:54:53.822 --> 02:54:58.816
pulls a small side bag that has a bunch of pieces
of paper in it. He unfurls one section, sets it

02:54:58.816 --> 02:55:00.411
down. "And your names?"

02:55:02.711 --> 02:55:05.526
MARISHA: Can't we all go under The Mighty Nein?

02:55:06.706 --> 02:55:11.064
MATT: "I'm sorry, but for the purposes of
maintaining organization within the paperwork here

02:55:11.064 --> 02:55:15.575
we need to know the names of those who are to
claim any rewards or benefits of completing a job."

02:55:15.594 --> 02:55:17.195
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm Philbin.

02:55:17.195 --> 02:55:19.523
MATT: "Philbin, all right. And you are?"

02:55:19.523 --> 02:55:20.594
LIAM: Regis.

02:55:23.474 --> 02:55:25.230
MARISHA: Damn it, I can't say it now.

02:55:25.230 --> 02:55:26.356
TRAVIS: Yeah, fucker.

02:55:27.216 --> 02:55:27.886
MARISHA: Lawrence.

02:55:28.476 --> 02:55:29.463
MATT: "Lawrence."

02:55:30.493 --> 02:55:31.500
SAM: Kylre.

02:55:33.710 --> 02:55:34.598
MATT: "Kylre."

02:55:37.208 --> 02:55:37.896
TALIESIN: Esma.

02:55:39.206 --> 02:55:40.611
MATT: "Esma, all right."

02:55:43.191 --> 02:55:44.803
ASHLEY: Um. Barry.

02:55:44.803 --> 02:55:50.050
(laughter)

02:55:50.050 --> 02:55:51.421
TALIESIN: Short for Barrymore.

02:55:52.241 --> 02:55:55.847
ASHLEY: It's short for Barrymore, but I just go by
Barry.

02:55:57.477 --> 02:55:59.021
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:56:00.221 --> 02:56:02.139
TRAVIS: The head-shake afterward is the best

02:56:06.689 --> 02:56:12.684
ASHLEY: Oh! D&amp;D Beyond! Am I remembering how to do
this?

02:56:12.684 --> 02:56:14.447
SAM: What screen are you on?

02:56:18.217 --> 02:56:19.023
ASHLEY: I'm still new.

02:56:19.723 --> 02:56:22.047
SAM: Refreshing! What did you roll?

02:56:22.047 --> 02:56:23.428
ASHLEY: Refreshing, it's loading.

02:56:24.477 --> 02:56:27.469
MARISHA: Ashley, that's DocuSign, you're in the
wrong app completely!

02:56:27.469 --> 02:56:30.058
TALIESIN: Really, oh wow, that's a number.

02:56:30.058 --> 02:56:31.809
ASHLEY: Okay, 13.

02:56:31.809 --> 02:56:33.145
MATT: Okay.

02:56:33.145 --> 02:56:34.307
TRAVIS: Is it a minus?

02:56:34.307 --> 02:56:35.626
TALIESIN: It's a minus two.

02:56:36.736 --> 02:56:44.671
MATT: "All right, Barry. Okay (clears throat).
This here is a writ of Lawmaster intent. This will

02:56:44.671 --> 02:56:51.170
"give you entrance to the location of where the job
is supposed to take place. This supposed creature

02:56:51.170 --> 02:57:00.094
"has holed up in a sewer nexus right on where the
Interstead Sprawl meets with the outer wall of the

02:57:00.094 --> 02:57:07.797
"Tri-Spires. We need you to travel down there, and,
well, let's say there's a whole region on the

02:57:07.797 --> 02:57:12.840
"inside where we've been hearing about this backing
up of various liquid and strange noises from

02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:17.610
"cleaners who were making their way through, so we
sent a few crownsguards down and came across a

02:57:17.610 --> 02:57:25.643
"mass of congealed sewage slime and webbing, so the
<i>fucking cowards</i> ran back and we need to dig

02:57:25.643 --> 02:57:32.405
"deeper. So here we are: find a way of whatever is
creating this disturbance, kill it, take it back

02:57:32.405 --> 02:57:37.111
"with proof of the kill, whatever built that little
nest, and the Crown is willing to drop you about

02:57:37.111 --> 02:57:38.557
"700 gold pieces."

02:57:39.467 --> 02:57:40.490
TALIESIN: 700 gold pieces?

02:57:40.490 --> 02:57:41.795
MATT: "That's correct."

02:57:42.495 --> 02:57:46.351
TALIESIN: Just for the entrance, they are aware
that there are several of us, we are just

02:57:46.351 --> 02:57:48.399
representatives of a slightly larger group.

02:57:48.399 --> 02:57:51.312
MATT: "Well, you have to divide it evenly from the
700 you get."

02:57:51.312 --> 02:57:53.900
TALIESIN: Of course, but we can all get entrance
from this writ?

02:57:53.900 --> 02:57:55.779
MATT: "All the ones that are named on here."

02:57:55.779 --> 02:57:57.471
TALIESIN: You need all the names of everybody
involved?

02:57:58.461 --> 02:57:59.735
MATT: "There's more involved?"

02:57:59.735 --> 02:58:01.318
TALIESIN: Well, we're called the Mighty "Nine,"
aren't we?

02:58:03.238 --> 02:58:08.312
MATT: (groans) Takes the writ. "And who are the
other companions?"

02:58:08.312 --> 02:58:10.397
TALIESIN: Well, let's just send seven of us down
for now.

02:58:10.397 --> 02:58:11.918
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fair.

02:58:11.918 --> 02:58:13.642
SAM: Seven of nine?

02:58:14.232 --> 02:58:24.101
TALIESIN: Oh, really? I've never felt such hatred
than this moment. Wow, god damn it.

02:58:24.471 --> 02:58:26.503
TRAVIS: What are those other two called? I
forget.

02:58:27.493 --> 02:58:29.152
ASHLEY: We've got Karen--

02:58:29.152 --> 02:58:30.867
TRAVIS: (laughing) Karen.

02:58:31.457 --> 02:58:32.560
SAM: And Rothschild.

02:58:33.690 --> 02:58:35.658
MATT: "Karen and Rothschild."

02:58:35.658 --> 02:58:44.066
ASHLEY: Yeah. Wouldn't that mean we would get 900
gold? 100 per person-- per, you know?

02:58:44.066 --> 02:58:47.187
MATT: "No, that would be 700 gold, split between
the lot of you."

02:58:47.187 --> 02:58:52.530
TRAVIS: Just to be clear, there's no clearage of
sewage? We're just here to take care of whatever's

02:58:52.530 --> 02:58:55.099
causing that webbing you mentioned.

02:58:55.099 --> 02:58:59.168
MATT: "Whatever's causing the blockage, and the
webbing, whatever else they found down there. Yes,

02:58:59.168 --> 02:59:01.265
"take care of that, bring back proof of the
death."

02:59:02.245 --> 02:59:03.683
TRAVIS: Proof of-- okay.

02:59:03.683 --> 02:59:05.821
MARISHA: But you don't know what did it?

02:59:05.821 --> 02:59:07.441
SAM: Do you know what kind of monster it is?

02:59:07.441 --> 02:59:09.485
MATT: "No fucking clue, that's why you're being
paid 700 gold for it!"

02:59:11.725 --> 02:59:13.177
SAM: Okay. Have people been killed?

02:59:14.737 --> 02:59:19.712
MATT: "People have gone missing. You think you're
the first to try and take the job? No, it's

02:59:19.712 --> 02:59:24.001
"dangerous! That's why we're paying so much. If you
don't want it, go away. If you want it, here's the

02:59:24.001 --> 02:59:25.272
"writ, good luck."

02:59:25.962 --> 02:59:26.795
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:59:26.795 --> 02:59:30.251
TRAVIS: Mighty obliged, we'll take care of this
most expediently.

02:59:30.251 --> 02:59:31.346
MARISHA: Bye.

02:59:31.346 --> 02:59:33.257
ASHLEY: Wait! Has anyone gone and come back?

02:59:33.257 --> 02:59:41.226
MATT: "There have been three times that it's been
taken up and one's come back declining it and two

02:59:41.226 --> 02:59:42.861
"that have not."

02:59:43.681 --> 02:59:47.444
TRAVIS: Declining it? For any specific reason or
did they just change their mind?

02:59:48.424 --> 02:59:49.834
MATT: "Think they changed their mind a bit."

02:59:51.224 --> 02:59:52.217
ASHLEY: We'll take care of it.

02:59:53.247 --> 02:59:54.570
MATT: "I'm sure you will."

02:59:56.490 --> 02:59:58.688
ASHLEY: I sense a little sarcasm in you, sir.

03:00:00.158 --> 03:00:03.177
MATT: "It's a dwarven thing. We've got resting
bitch voice."

03:00:03.177 --> 03:00:06.627
(laughter)

03:00:06.627 --> 03:00:07.840
ASHLEY: Fair enough.

03:00:07.840 --> 03:00:09.788
TRAVIS: Good day to you. We'll take care of this.

03:00:10.478 --> 03:00:13.331
MATT: "Great. Well, shove off!"

03:00:13.331 --> 03:00:14.298
SAM: Okay!

03:00:14.298 --> 03:00:15.527
TRAVIS: And we leave.

03:00:15.697 --> 03:00:16.924
TALIESIN: We walk away.

03:00:16.924 --> 03:00:18.099
MATT: All right.

03:00:21.199 --> 03:00:22.149
MARISHA: Theoretically.

03:00:22.459 --> 03:00:23.286
TRAVIS: Yeah?

03:00:24.246 --> 03:00:28.405
MARISHA: Not that I want to be a-- what's the
word-- "shysta"?

03:00:29.195 --> 03:00:29.921
LIAM: Shyster.

03:00:29.921 --> 03:00:32.614
SAM and TRAVIS: Shakäste.

03:00:33.724 --> 03:00:39.858
MARISHA: If they don't know what the monster is,
and we have a perfectly good manticore head--

03:00:39.858 --> 03:00:41.958
TALIESIN: Then they're going to send people down
there.

03:00:41.958 --> 03:00:43.520
TRAVIS: That's not really our problem.

03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:44.834
TALIESIN: But then they'll know.

03:00:45.474 --> 03:00:46.854
MARISHA: If we get the gold first.

03:00:46.854 --> 03:00:48.403
ASHLEY: Maybe it came back to life?

03:00:49.503 --> 03:00:54.490
TALIESIN: As someone who actually has towns that
they can't re-enter again for reasons, that we

03:00:54.490 --> 03:01:01.600
will go into later, over booze-- it's best to keep
a clear reputation.

03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:04.706
TRAVIS: Beau does have a good point, though. I
mean, if we get down there and it's some

03:01:04.706 --> 03:01:06.144
world-ending monster--

03:01:06.684 --> 03:01:07.903
TALIESIN: We can just run back up.

03:01:08.453 --> 03:01:12.030
MARISHA: We found a manticore, who knows, they
make nests.

03:01:12.500 --> 03:01:14.059
TALIESIN: There's a blacksmith who knows.

03:01:15.479 --> 03:01:19.318
MARISHA: Do you think the blacksmith cares what
the Empire is doing? The blacksmith is just trying

03:01:19.318 --> 03:01:20.209
to survive.

03:01:20.209 --> 03:01:25.098
TALIESIN: I think the blacksmith will get ten gold
for telling them if they find out there was a

03:01:25.098 --> 03:01:26.403
manticore down there that--

03:01:27.253 --> 03:01:28.577
MARISHA: If the blacksmith knows.

03:01:31.447 --> 03:01:33.099
SAM: It's a good plan B.

03:01:33.099 --> 03:01:36.028
TALIESIN: It's an emergency plan. It's a good plan
B, I'll grant you that.

03:01:36.718 --> 03:01:42.274
TRAVIS: I head to the outside and wait out by the
posting where we last saw Caleb and Jester.

03:01:42.724 --> 03:01:44.061
SAM: Karen and Rothschild.

03:01:44.061 --> 03:01:46.882
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Karen and Rothschild.

03:01:46.882 --> 03:01:48.296
TALIESIN: I'm going to juggle.

03:01:49.716 --> 03:01:54.833
MATT: After asking some questions and making your
way around you eventually find the Tri-Spires,

03:01:54.833 --> 03:01:58.859
which is not too difficult to see once you know
what you're looking for. You see these three very

03:01:58.859 --> 03:02:07.406
unique-looking towers that ascend past a round
wall that encases the interior of this elite

03:02:07.406 --> 03:02:13.977
portion of the city. As you approach the wall--
the outer walls you see are basic stonework and

03:02:13.977 --> 03:02:18.346
masonry, thick as they may be and used as from a
defensive position-- these walls are made of solid

03:02:18.346 --> 03:02:29.607
marble, and look more decorative than designed to
be a military buttress of any kind. As you

03:02:29.607 --> 03:02:36.236
approach, you can see there are two entrances to
it-- or at least you've been told there are two.

03:02:36.236 --> 03:02:42.433
The one that's nearest to you opens in the
direction of the Pentamarket, and while the

03:02:42.433 --> 03:02:46.583
portcullis is lifted you see there are two
crownsguard there, currently standing with spears

03:02:46.583 --> 03:02:54.845
and shields at the ready. A horse-drawn carriage
clomps by you and makes its way inside. You guys

03:02:54.845 --> 03:02:59.094
approach and one of the guards steps forward. "Can
I help you, please?"

03:02:59.444 --> 03:03:01.649
LAURA: Yes, we have business at the Pillow Trove.

03:03:05.479 --> 03:03:07.542
MATT: "I don't think you do. Please, shove off."

03:03:07.542 --> 03:03:11.992
LAURA: Oh, well, I have business at the Pillow
Trove.

03:03:15.742 --> 03:03:17.850
MATT: "What's your business with the Pillow
Trove?"

03:03:17.850 --> 03:03:22.722
LAURA: I have a package that's being delivered
there. What business do you have at the Pillow Trove?

03:03:25.252 --> 03:03:28.408
MATT: "Look, your friend here looks like he just
wandered out of the Evening Nip if anything, so it

03:03:28.408 --> 03:03:29.297
would be best--"

03:03:29.297 --> 03:03:35.214
LAURA: Oh, yes, I hired him to protect me because
you know I'm very fragile and delicate, but if he

03:03:35.214 --> 03:03:42.363
doesn't look well enough to be my guard, you're
welcome to walk me instead.

03:03:43.493 --> 03:03:46.216
MATT: They look at each other. Make a persuasion
check.

03:03:47.476 --> 03:03:49.694
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Come on!

03:03:49.694 --> 03:03:52.694
(exclamation of surprise)

03:03:52.694 --> 03:03:53.412
LAURA: 22!

03:03:55.212 --> 03:03:56.013
TALIESIN: That was impressive.

03:03:56.013 --> 03:04:00.466
MATT: Look at each other, look back at you. "All
right, I'll walk you in. Briefly. Then I'll get

03:04:00.466 --> 03:04:02.870
back to my post. You, stay the fuck out of this."

03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:07.370
LAURA: (whispering) Sorry, Caleb. I'll let you know 
what it's like, okay?

03:04:08.470 --> 03:04:09.775
MARISHA: Rejected!

03:04:09.775 --> 03:04:12.527
LAURA: (whispering) Frumpkin, kitty, kitty.

03:04:13.467 --> 03:04:19.252
MATT: "All right, to the Pillow Trove. This way,
follow me." The other guard steps past him and

03:04:19.252 --> 03:04:27.654
blocks you from the other two. As the guard guides
you in he makes a big whistle sound, does a finger

03:04:27.654 --> 03:04:31.343
loop, and you watch as another guard gets relieved
and comes down to help him at the front doorway.

03:04:31.343 --> 03:04:34.039
LAURA: You guys are really on top of your shit in
here.

03:04:35.719 --> 03:04:41.086
MATT: "Thank you. I appreciate that." Now,
stepping into the Tri-Spires--

03:04:41.086 --> 03:04:43.888
LIAM: Does that happen lickety-split, the second
guard comes down?

03:04:43.888 --> 03:04:51.505
MATT: There's maybe a 20 second period where he's
making his way down. You get the sense from the

03:04:51.505 --> 03:05:00.334
look of this, and glancing through the interior,
you see elements of beautiful courtyard parks with

03:05:00.334 --> 03:05:08.638
trees and bushes. You can see statuesque
structures that decorate what normally was just

03:05:09.092 --> 03:05:13.301
dirt road with occasional bits of stonework, as
beautifully laid cobblestone from the interior,

03:05:13.301 --> 03:05:19.402
you can see homesteads of different styles of
construction from all across this continent and

03:05:19.402 --> 03:05:25.924
beyond. This is where the money in the city goes.
This is the district where the elite live, where

03:05:25.924 --> 03:05:32.834
the elite work, and where folk of very specific
visual presentation and purpose are allowed entry.

03:05:33.234 --> 03:05:37.537
LIAM: Right, and as she goes and does her thing, I
just want you to know that Frumpkin does follow

03:05:37.537 --> 03:05:43.285
her, and I leave and walk around the block, and
duck into an alley, or any private place, and cast

03:05:43.285 --> 03:05:48.229
Disguise Self on myself to make myself look very
resplendent.

03:05:48.729 --> 03:05:51.619
MATT: Roll a stealth check for Frumpkin.

03:05:51.619 --> 03:05:57.041
LIAM: For Frumpkin? It's not very good. That is
only a four.

03:05:58.681 --> 03:06:04.004
MATT: As Frumpkin begins to (meowing) run on its
way, and one of the guards goes, "Piss off," and

03:06:04.004 --> 03:06:08.570
kicks Frumpkin about ten feet off, and stumbles
and skids, and then gets back up.

03:06:08.570 --> 03:06:10.153
MARISHA: No! Not okay!

03:06:10.153 --> 03:06:11.773
LIAM: Does that take any damage?

03:06:11.773 --> 03:06:12.652
MATT: I'd say take one point of damage.

03:06:12.652 --> 03:06:13.459
LIAM: Gone.

03:06:13.459 --> 03:06:15.871
LAURA: No, you said one point?

03:06:15.871 --> 03:06:19.111
LIAM: I rolled hit points for him when I made him,
and it was one, so he's gone.

03:06:20.711 --> 03:06:22.205
TRAVIS: (explosion)

03:06:22.205 --> 03:06:24.451
MARISHA: You kicked his cat into oblivion!

03:06:24.451 --> 03:06:26.606
TRAVIS: You kicked his cat until it burst!

03:06:26.606 --> 03:06:27.471
MATT: I didn't.

03:06:27.471 --> 03:06:28.759
TRAVIS: He kicked his cat so hard!

03:06:28.759 --> 03:06:33.139
TRAVIS and LAURA: He kicked the highlights out of
his hair!

03:06:33.139 --> 03:06:36.411
LIAM: Who's laughing now, Billy? Who's laughing
now?

03:06:38.721 --> 03:06:41.422
MATT: Stray cats can't just wander into--

03:06:41.422 --> 03:06:46.468
LIAM: Caleb curses to himself and wanders around,
and does what he says, suddenly looking very

03:06:46.468 --> 03:06:49.736
noble. I'll let that go and then I'll follow up.

03:06:49.736 --> 03:06:53.927
TRAVIS: You guys, I kicked this cat today, and it
fucking evaporated.

03:06:53.927 --> 03:06:56.060
(laughter)

03:06:56.060 --> 03:06:59.199
TALIESIN: If that isn't a beer-worthy story, I
don't know what is.

03:07:00.239 --> 03:07:01.970
TRAVIS: Somebody punch me. (punching sound)

03:07:02.730 --> 03:07:04.730
LIAM: Caleb is <i>pissed.</i>

03:07:05.930 --> 03:07:12.558
MATT: The guard looks a bit confused. As you
wander back, he's pointing at the tip of his boot,

03:07:12.558 --> 03:07:18.701
and he's like, "I don't know, it was fucking
crazy." So what do you look like?

03:07:18.701 --> 03:07:26.179
LIAM: I am wearing the deepest black robes, and I
have a black goatee. Very Evil David Hasselhoff.

03:07:27.469 --> 03:07:29.201
TALIESIN: The Master from Doctor Who.

03:07:29.201 --> 03:07:30.006
LIAM: Sure, that.

03:07:30.006 --> 03:07:32.083
LAURA: He looks very embroidered and everything.

03:07:32.083 --> 03:07:39.107
LIAM: It's all black velvet. The way the audience
thinks Vax looks, that's what I look like right now.

03:07:39.677 --> 03:07:41.874
SAM: Kneel before Zod.

03:07:46.462 --> 03:07:51.967
LIAM: I have a meeting in 20 minutes at the Pillow
Inn. I don't know what it's called, but Caleb

03:07:51.967 --> 03:07:58.678
does. I don't remember shit, but Caleb says
whatever the name of it is, because of my feat.

03:07:58.678 --> 03:08:01.637
TALIESIN: This is the smartest feat you've ever
taken.

03:08:02.507 --> 03:08:06.547
LIAM: Of course it is, it was chosen very
specifically. I say whatever it's called--

03:08:06.547 --> 03:08:07.365
MATT: The Pillow Trove.

03:08:09.485 --> 03:08:16.208
LIAM: I don't remember, he does. I have a meeting
in 20 minutes at the Pillow Grove-- I know that's

03:08:16.208 --> 03:08:20.782
wrong-- Right now, 20 minutes, I need to get in.

03:08:23.212 --> 03:08:28.175
MATT: They both blink their eyes at you. As you
glance down to look at your hand, it's your

03:08:28.175 --> 03:08:28.692
regular sleeve.

03:08:32.452 --> 03:08:33.742
LIAM: The spell didn't work here?

03:08:33.742 --> 03:08:37.135
MATT: It worked, but then as you approached, you
looked down and it's no longer there.

03:08:37.135 --> 03:08:39.596
(gasping)

03:08:39.596 --> 03:08:41.500
MARISHA: Oh, magic shit.

03:08:42.470 --> 03:08:50.111
MATT: You have a sense now, you think back to the
air of magical longevity the spell would maintain,

03:08:50.111 --> 03:08:51.200
it's gone.

03:08:51.200 --> 03:08:52.042
LIAM: Oh, wow.

03:08:52.042 --> 03:08:53.549
SAM: Oh no.

03:08:53.549 --> 03:08:54.383
TRAVIS: Disguise Self?

03:08:55.503 --> 03:08:56.736
LIAM: Yeah, he used Disguise Self.

03:08:57.716 --> 03:08:58.801
LAURA: So they dispelled it?

03:08:59.491 --> 03:09:00.345
LIAM: We don't know.

03:09:01.495 --> 03:09:06.336
MATT: At some point, as you approached and then
walked up to the gate, your Disguise Self just

03:09:06.336 --> 03:09:10.490
dissipated. The one guard that was there before is
like--

03:09:13.690 --> 03:09:15.148
LIAM: Okay, I just walk away.

03:09:16.458 --> 03:09:19.267
MATT: As you walk away, he just goes, "Yeah,
that's what I thought."

03:09:19.267 --> 03:09:20.022
LIAM: Cat kicker.

03:09:21.452 --> 03:09:25.969
MATT: "Quick meeting, right? Quick fucking
meeting."

03:09:25.969 --> 03:09:26.933
SAM: Kill that guy.

03:09:26.933 --> 03:09:27.872
LAURA: What a dick.

03:09:28.492 --> 03:09:30.026
MARISHA: You just made some guard's night.

03:09:34.486 --> 03:09:35.817
TALIESIN: We got to kill that guard.

03:09:35.817 --> 03:09:36.687
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's gone.

03:09:36.687 --> 03:09:44.490
MATT: You are escorted to the exterior of the
Pillow Trove, which would be over here in the Tri-Spires.

03:09:46.525 --> 03:09:48.817
MARISHA: I wonder how much of the Tri-Spires is
like this?

03:09:48.817 --> 03:09:50.306
TRAVIS: It's got to be locked up--

03:09:50.306 --> 03:09:50.905
MARISHA: Right?

03:09:50.905 --> 03:09:51.941
LIAM: Yeah, it's fancy pants.

03:09:51.941 --> 03:09:59.322
MATT: You're led down the beautiful cobblestone
street. Around the bend of this beautiful

03:09:59.785 --> 03:10:04.825
courtyard where you can see a family that is
currently sitting down and having an open-air

03:10:04.825 --> 03:10:11.721
picnic here amongst the grass. Butterflies in the
air, it's picturesque to the point where you

03:10:11.721 --> 03:10:20.942
question how engineered it is to a certain degree.
With a couple of quick spins, you see one that

03:10:20.942 --> 03:10:29.795
catches your eye, which is really interesting,
this massive one of the Tri-Spire towers that's

03:10:29.795 --> 03:10:36.120
closest to the vicinity of The Pillow Trove, looks
like it was this old temple that's been completely

03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:44.932
hollowed out and re-purposed to look like a glitzy
casino. There are banners that are pulled across

03:10:44.932 --> 03:10:51.984
in brightly-colored silks that mingle and braid
into each other. You can see on each different

03:10:51.984 --> 03:10:56.953
floor there's a different tone to the stone that's
been slightly altered, and you can see signs

03:10:56.953 --> 03:11:06.587
showing different forms of entertainment. It's
simultaneously historically awe-inspiring and

03:11:06.587 --> 03:11:10.433
gaudy combination that is intriguing.

03:11:10.433 --> 03:11:11.645
LAURA: Like Caesar's Palace?

03:11:11.645 --> 03:11:17.045
MATT: Kind of, yeah. It's a little Vegas-y,
compared to the rest of this area. You can see a

03:11:17.045 --> 03:11:20.537
lot of the--

03:11:20.537 --> 03:11:22.846
MARISHA: There's clouds painted on the ceiling for
no reason.

03:11:23.486 --> 03:11:29.170
MATT: At the corners of these roads, you can see
these tall lanterns that contain a very faintly

03:11:29.170 --> 03:11:37.775
ever-burning flame. Between each of them, there's
a long, white, silken banner that hangs as part of

03:11:37.775 --> 03:11:43.303
decoration along each road. The roads themselves
feel like they're always in some loose parade-type

03:11:43.303 --> 03:11:49.686
celebration, that's just part of the decor of the
vicinity. The stark contrast between the

03:11:49.686 --> 03:11:58.726
Outersteads, to even the moderately average
Innersteads, to the Tri-Spires is astronomical.

03:11:59.256 --> 03:12:01.452
LAURA: Can I ask the guard: What is that
building?

03:12:02.742 --> 03:12:04.331
MATT: "Have you not been here before?"

03:12:04.331 --> 03:12:06.181
LAURA: No. I'm new to town, actually.

03:12:07.201 --> 03:12:21.153
MATT: "Interesting. You're in the Silken Terrace.
What you're looking at right there is called the

03:12:21.153 --> 03:12:32.443
Triumph Chime. It's got all sorts of bars,
gambling halls, inn rooms, brothel, everything you

03:12:32.443 --> 03:12:33.315
need up here."

03:12:33.315 --> 03:12:36.281
LAURA: Oh, wow. I didn't think you had things like
this in the Empire.

03:12:37.471 --> 03:12:42.133
MATT: "We've got them in places. What, you think
we're uncivilized folk? Where are you from?"

03:12:42.133 --> 03:12:45.418
LAURA: I'm from the Menagerie Coast, actually.
Nicodranas.

03:12:46.248 --> 03:12:48.499
MATT: "Huh. Well, you'll feel right at home,
yeah."

03:12:48.929 --> 03:12:49.681
LAURA: Quite.

03:12:51.471 --> 03:12:55.593
MATT: "Well, here you are. Pillow Trove." As he
motions over to the side, you see this luxurious

03:12:55.593 --> 03:13:02.664
inn that has this cylindrical appearance to the
front and then turns into a blocky building

03:13:02.664 --> 03:13:14.226
behind. It has this gold and deep purple
coloration to the pillars that hold up the various

03:13:14.226 --> 03:13:22.301
walls to each intersection, and as soon as you
walk inside, the scents of scented candles and

03:13:22.301 --> 03:13:31.060
various lavender-type smells hit your nose. The
element of it reminds you of home. As you walk

03:13:31.060 --> 03:13:40.434
inside, there's a beautiful semi-circle desk, and
a human woman, probably in her mid-20s or so, jet

03:13:40.434 --> 03:13:45.324
black hair that's straight and dangles past her
shoulders, watches you approach, as the guard

03:13:45.324 --> 03:13:47.465
says, "I'll wait here and escort you out when
you're done."

03:13:47.465 --> 03:13:59.722
LAURA: Thank you very much, kind sir! I walk
grandiosely up to the woman. Hello. I have a

03:13:59.722 --> 03:14:02.449
package that's being delivered to here.

03:14:04.489 --> 03:14:07.048
MATT: "Very well. What is the name receiving?"

03:14:07.048 --> 03:14:07.935
LAURA: Jester.

03:14:09.475 --> 03:14:13.109
MATT: "I shall inquire. I'll be back here in just
a moment."

03:14:13.109 --> 03:14:14.694
LAURA: Thank you very much.

03:14:14.694 --> 03:14:18.956
MATT: As she leaves from the front desk, you can
see there are two crownsguard that are assigned to

03:14:18.956 --> 03:14:23.902
the sides that are keeping a close watch on you,
but they're lackadaisy through their day. You

03:14:23.902 --> 03:14:30.200
get the sense they probably don't have to work too
hard this side of the city. About five minutes pass.

03:14:31.012 --> 03:14:33.297
LAURA: Is anybody watching me?

03:14:33.833 --> 03:14:40.579
MATT: They're both watching you, but not intently
like hawks, more just making sure you're not doing

03:14:40.579 --> 03:14:52.353
anything silly. You watch as a rather bounding
obese merchant in his late 40s or so comes

03:14:52.353 --> 03:14:59.885
barreling down the stairway, sniffling hard and
rubbing his nose. He's dressed really well-- maybe

03:14:59.885 --> 03:15:05.474
a size too small, trying to reclaim a presentation
maybe of a younger self and he hasn't quite come

03:15:05.474 --> 03:15:10.966
to terms with the fact that he's hitting that age.
As he walks past, he goes, "Ah. Good day."

03:15:11.436 --> 03:15:12.317
LAURA: Good day.

03:15:13.487 --> 03:15:18.095
MATT: He exits the building. Another five minutes
pass, and eventually the woman comes back and she

03:15:18.095 --> 03:15:25.470
goes, "I'm sorry, we don't have a package for that
name here. Is there any other it might be under?"

03:15:25.470 --> 03:15:27.987
LAURA: Maybe under Lavorre?

03:15:29.687 --> 03:15:30.796
MATT: "I'll check."

03:15:30.796 --> 03:15:31.420
LAURA: Okay.

03:15:31.420 --> 03:15:38.821
MATT: She leaves again for another few minutes.
Comes back after that, "I'm sorry, there's nothing

03:15:38.821 --> 03:15:39.630
under that name."

03:15:41.460 --> 03:15:44.526
LAURA: Anything from The Ruby of the Sea, maybe?

03:15:46.456 --> 03:15:47.611
MATT: "I'll check one more time."

03:15:47.611 --> 03:15:48.493
LAURA: Okay, thank you.

03:15:48.493 --> 03:15:49.655
MATT: She leaves.

03:15:50.485 --> 03:15:53.324
LAURA: I smile back at the guard, like (pained
laugh) this is crazy, isn't it?

03:15:55.514 --> 03:16:02.491
MATT: She comes back out. "I'm terribly sorry, we
do not have a package for or under any of those names.

03:16:04.502 --> 03:16:15.804
LAURA: Well, that's really weird. Okay. Well, tell
you what, how about, because it's probably going

03:16:15.804 --> 03:16:24.601
to be coming, you know, I'm here really early for
it, you know-- so if it comes for me-- when it

03:16:24.601 --> 03:16:31.339
does-- could you leave word with the guard outside
the Tri-Spire?

03:16:33.219 --> 03:16:34.098
MATT: "Which one?"

03:16:34.478 --> 03:16:36.114
LAURA: The guard house, you know.

03:16:36.114 --> 03:16:37.418
MATT: "Oh. All right, okay."

03:16:37.418 --> 03:16:41.488
LAURA: Then I can come and ask if it's been
delivered and then I can come, because I don't

03:16:41.488 --> 03:16:44.681
want to have to walk all the way here, you know,
if it's not here for me yet.

03:16:44.681 --> 03:16:46.122
MATT: "Very well. I'll make a note of it."

03:16:46.122 --> 03:16:49.818
LAURA: Okay. Unless I should maybe stay here,
waiting for it?

03:16:50.488 --> 03:16:53.075
MATT: "If you like, we could set you up with a
room."

03:16:53.075 --> 03:16:55.091
LAURA: Oh! Yes, how much would that be?

03:16:55.521 --> 03:17:00.977
MATT: "Well, depends on the size. We have our
general suites, we have the lordly suites, and

03:17:00.977 --> 03:17:08.043
then we have the diplomatic invitational suites.
Pricing begins at ten gold per room for the basic

03:17:08.043 --> 03:17:13.551
suites, 20 for the next tier up, and for the
diplomatic ones, those run about 50 gold a night."

03:17:14.261 --> 03:17:24.907
LAURA: Well, I normally stay in the diplomatic
rooms, but I guess the smallest room because, you

03:17:24.907 --> 03:17:25.956
know, I'm small.

03:17:26.516 --> 03:17:29.705
MATT: "Of course. Ten gold per night, how long do
you plan to stay?"

03:17:31.725 --> 03:17:35.973
LAURA: Probably just tonight, because it'll
probably be here in the morning.

03:17:35.973 --> 03:17:37.934
MATT: "All right. That was Jester, right?"

03:17:37.934 --> 03:17:38.400
LAURA: Yes.

03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:39.764
MATT: "Very well, all right."

03:17:41.734 --> 03:17:43.330
LAURA: Oh yes, here you go, thank you.

03:17:43.330 --> 03:17:45.327
MATT: "Thank you, and here is the key to your
room."

03:17:45.327 --> 03:17:45.906
LAURA: Oh, thank you!

03:17:45.906 --> 03:17:50.618
MATT: "Second floor, third door on the left, it
should be number 12."

03:17:50.618 --> 03:17:53.031
LAURA: 12, that's my favorite number!

03:17:54.481 --> 03:17:56.361
MATT: "So sorry I couldn't be of help with you."

03:17:56.361 --> 03:17:59.438
LAURA: Okay. I go upstairs.

03:18:00.708 --> 03:18:01.247
MATT: Okay.

03:18:01.687 --> 03:18:02.676
LAURA: I sit down.

03:18:03.216 --> 03:18:07.367
MATT: You get into your room. The door opens, it's
a beautiful small room, but well decorated and a

03:18:07.367 --> 03:18:16.168
nice queen-size canopy bed and a dresser with a
mirror, a chair, a little--

03:18:17.668 --> 03:18:18.536
SAM: Mini-fridge.

03:18:20.246 --> 03:18:20.731
TALIESIN: Wet bar.

03:18:20.731 --> 03:18:41.460
LAURA: Right? Hmm. Traveler? Are you here? Shit.
Okay. I don't know where I'm staying tonight,

03:18:41.460 --> 03:18:47.841
Traveler, I might be here, I might be with my
friends, but-- Okay, I'll see you soon, okay! And

03:18:47.841 --> 03:18:49.532
I run back out of the room.

03:18:49.532 --> 03:18:56.989
MATT: You turn and in the hallway to where you
entered, you see a familiar cloak of deep green, hooded.

03:18:57.538 --> 03:19:01.060
LAURA: (gasps) Hi!

03:19:02.220 --> 03:19:09.719
MATT: The cloak nods down towards you and the
voice slowly cascades out from underneath, "I'm so

03:19:09.719 --> 03:19:19.954
sorry she's not aware that you're here now, but
you're with friends."

03:19:24.474 --> 03:19:32.068
LAURA: Okay. Do you think you could help me,
though?

03:19:35.468 --> 03:19:38.564
MATT: "Child, I think I help you quite a bit
already."

03:19:38.564 --> 03:19:41.282
LAURA: I know. You do.

03:19:43.252 --> 03:19:44.425
MATT: "What do you need?"

03:19:44.425 --> 03:19:48.928
LAURA: I don't know how to let her know-- I don't
know what to do.

03:19:54.198 --> 03:19:58.420
MATT: He leans forward and the hand reaches out
and takes your chin a little bit and holds it

03:19:58.420 --> 03:20:05.934
there. There in the dark space of the hood, you
can see the familiar verdant irises looking back

03:20:05.934 --> 03:20:13.212
and the warmth fills you once more, the comfort
that kept you comfortable so many years alone in

03:20:13.212 --> 03:20:32.834
that room. "I think the more deeds you do, the
more lives you change, the more confident brats

03:20:32.834 --> 03:20:38.023
you break-- She'll find you."

03:20:39.263 --> 03:20:44.618
LAURA: Okay. I pull out the pamphlet. Look what I
made for you!

03:20:47.698 --> 03:20:53.352
MATT: The hand pulls back and takes the pamphlet.
"Hmm. Adorable."

03:20:56.702 --> 03:20:59.620
LAURA: People are going to worship you like
crazy.

03:21:00.690 --> 03:21:02.246
MATT: "You know what to do, then?"

03:21:02.246 --> 03:21:05.940
LAURA: Yes! Okay. I missed you.

03:21:07.200 --> 03:21:08.086
MATT: "I'm never far."

03:21:11.696 --> 03:21:14.365
LAURA: (high-pitched) All right, I'm going to
walk, if you want to follow me, I'm going to go

03:21:14.365 --> 03:21:15.306
over here then.

03:21:15.306 --> 03:21:22.929
MATT: As you look down at the pamphlet and look up
to say that, he's gone. You hear this faint little

03:21:22.929 --> 03:21:25.569
(chuckles).

03:21:26.449 --> 03:21:27.908
LAURA: I skip away.

03:21:30.248 --> 03:21:30.934
TRAVIS: Skip away?

03:21:33.464 --> 03:21:39.240
LAURA: I go back to the guard. Okay, I have a room
here. I don't know if you need to escort me

03:21:39.240 --> 03:21:43.887
anymore because I'm staying here at The Pillow
Trove, but I'm going to go, okay?

03:21:44.717 --> 03:21:45.630
MATT: "Um, all right."

03:21:46.680 --> 03:21:47.084
LAURA: Okay.

03:21:48.474 --> 03:21:49.030
MATT: "You're welcome."

03:21:49.030 --> 03:21:51.597
LAURA: Hey, guard, what's your name?

03:21:53.237 --> 03:21:53.898
MATT: "Reeve."

03:21:53.898 --> 03:21:56.164
LAURA: Reeve, it's so nice to meet you, I'm
Jester.

03:21:56.164 --> 03:21:59.939
MATT: He had his hand out, looks like he's
expecting some sort of a tip--

03:21:59.939 --> 03:22:01.305
LAURA: And I shake it.

03:22:01.305 --> 03:22:02.443
MATT: "Oh, okay."

03:22:02.443 --> 03:22:08.158
LAURA: Hey, so that guy that I hired to guard me,
I gave him some money. What am I supposed to do,

03:22:08.158 --> 03:22:11.508
am I allowed to get him in here so he can actually
do his job?

03:22:11.508 --> 03:22:19.395
MATT: "He's not an interior guard. Based on his
markings, it looks like he's supposed to be at the perimeter."

03:22:19.395 --> 03:22:23.755
LAURA: The guy that was all in his tattered coat
and stuff?

03:22:23.755 --> 03:22:25.373
MATT: "Oh! I misunderstood."

03:22:25.373 --> 03:22:26.027
LAURA: Yeah.

03:22:28.237 --> 03:22:29.074
MATT: "He's not coming in."

03:22:29.074 --> 03:22:33.408
LAURA: But I hired him to guard me, though.

03:22:35.248 --> 03:22:39.651
MATT: "I'm sorry, we have to maintain a certain
kind of presentation here."

03:22:43.461 --> 03:22:45.318
LAURA: All right. Okay.

03:22:45.318 --> 03:22:50.720
LIAM: Quickly, could I have asked around and found
my way to the other entrance to this area by now?

03:22:50.720 --> 03:22:52.604
TRAVIS: Or to a Banana Republic, maybe?

03:22:52.604 --> 03:22:55.900
(laughter)

03:22:55.900 --> 03:22:59.591
LIAM: No, I have this. Super quick: a single
question at the gate.

03:22:59.591 --> 03:23:02.327
MATT: Yeah, in this time you could have made your
way around.

03:23:02.327 --> 03:23:05.810
LIAM: Ask around, find my way there. All right, so
I walk up straight, looking like me.

03:23:05.810 --> 03:23:06.315
MATT: Yeah.

03:23:07.225 --> 03:23:12.889
LIAM: Excuse me, may I have a word of your time--
may I have a moment of your time?

03:23:12.889 --> 03:23:13.633
MATT: "Piss off."

03:23:15.213 --> 03:23:21.621
LIAM: Listen to me, there is a store in here
called Chastity's Nook that sells dirty books. I

03:23:21.916 --> 03:23:27.101
have heard of it for months, and I am going to
shop at this store, and if you want to make three

03:23:27.101 --> 03:23:33.196
gold-- and if this one wants to make three gold--
you will let me in there to shop for smut at the store.

03:23:33.196 --> 03:23:40.969
MATT: You watch as his face-- His eyes go wide for
a second and he goes, "You're a fan of the

03:23:40.969 --> 03:23:42.075
Chastity Nook?"

03:23:44.195 --> 03:23:45.294
LIAM: I want to be.

03:23:47.664 --> 03:23:49.240
MATT: "You hear that?"

03:23:50.510 --> 03:23:54.598
LIAM: One, two, three. One, two, three, each of
you.

03:23:54.598 --> 03:23:57.047
MARISHA: The guard's a critter!

03:23:57.047 --> 03:23:57.738
MATT: "No!"

03:23:57.738 --> 03:24:00.543
ALL: Aww!

03:24:01.213 --> 03:24:02.214
MARISHA: Damn it!

03:24:02.705 --> 03:24:05.681
LAURA: You know, for six gold, you could buy
yourself some real fancy clothes.

03:24:07.471 --> 03:24:11.591
MATT: "I appreciate what you're trying to do, pay
off a Crownsguard of the city of Zadash to let

03:24:11.591 --> 03:24:17.824
you, a lowlife from the skids of the town, in the
most expensive and most well-guarded region of the

03:24:17.824 --> 03:24:20.606
city. I like my job, I like my head."

03:24:23.446 --> 03:24:26.187
LIAM: Okay, enjoy working for the man. I walk
off.

03:24:26.187 --> 03:24:28.910
TRAVIS: Yeah! Anarchy!

03:24:29.710 --> 03:24:30.372
TALIESIN: Boom!

03:24:32.472 --> 03:24:32.843
LIAM: Done.

03:24:34.223 --> 03:24:34.812
MATT: Jester?

03:24:36.232 --> 03:24:37.761
LAURA: I guess I go back to Caleb.

03:24:39.211 --> 03:24:42.198
MATT: Okay. You guys meet up on the outside of the
district.

03:24:44.268 --> 03:24:45.194
LIAM: How was it?

03:24:45.194 --> 03:24:52.023
LAURA: It was really pretty in there. People are
kind of stupid, but I did talk to the Traveler, so

03:24:52.023 --> 03:24:56.178
everything's cool. Also, I don't have any money.

03:24:57.238 --> 03:25:00.189
LIAM: That's okay, I have a little bit of money,
do you need some?

03:25:00.189 --> 03:25:01.425
LAURA: No, I mean I have--

03:25:01.425 --> 03:25:02.978
LIAM: I have about 50 gold, do you want me to give
you some?

03:25:02.978 --> 03:25:06.530
LAURA: I mean, that's about as much as I have now.
It's so stupid, though!

03:25:06.530 --> 03:25:07.925
LIAM: That's a lot of money!

03:25:07.925 --> 03:25:09.589
LAURA: It's not, Caleb.

03:25:09.589 --> 03:25:10.891
LIAM: It <i>is</i>!

03:25:10.891 --> 03:25:12.734
LAURA: It's not!

03:25:13.274 --> 03:25:16.812
LIAM: That's more money than my parents ever made
in their entire life.

03:25:16.812 --> 03:25:20.926
LAURA: That's what I made, like, every day for my
allowance!

03:25:25.506 --> 03:25:31.884
LIAM: In full view of Jester, I reach into my
pocket and take what's left of the mud and just--

03:25:31.884 --> 03:25:39.798
Then I storm off towards our original shitty inn.

03:25:39.798 --> 03:25:44.090
LAURA: Caleb! I didn't mean to make you put your
shit on your face again.

03:25:45.220 --> 03:25:46.120
LIAM: I don't hear that.

03:25:46.120 --> 03:25:54.451
MATT: As you guys jaunt off to catch up with the
rest of the troop, meeting probably-- because you

03:25:54.451 --> 03:26:02.110
guys would probably be heading back to The Leaky
Tap. You manage to gather in the center of the

03:26:02.110 --> 03:26:09.910
common area. You see a freshly-muddied Caleb enter
with a somewhat flustered, but smiling, Jester.

03:26:10.198 --> 03:26:11.002
TRAVIS: Hey-- oh.

03:26:11.530 --> 03:26:13.533
MARISHA: Yeah! Hi-- oh.

03:26:14.543 --> 03:26:17.622
TALIESIN: We're clean, we're relaxed, we're ready
to go into a sewer.

03:26:19.252 --> 03:26:21.442
TRAVIS: Fitting, absolutely fitting.

03:26:22.282 --> 03:26:24.493
ASHLEY: How did-- didn't you just--?

03:26:25.123 --> 03:26:28.928
SAM: This is his normal look-- I think it's very
nice, actually.

03:26:28.928 --> 03:26:29.628
TALIESIN: I do, too.

03:26:29.628 --> 03:26:38.766
ASHLEY: I thought we took a-- Hey, I am not a
person to judge. I know I don't look-- It's fine.

03:26:38.766 --> 03:26:40.945
Where are we going again?

03:26:40.945 --> 03:26:43.586
LIAM: I like you. Do you want to hang with us for
a while?

03:26:44.206 --> 03:26:45.020
ASHLEY: I don't know.

03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:48.719
LIAM: Oh, this day is great!

03:26:51.669 --> 03:26:52.388
TRAVIS: We'll take it.

03:26:52.388 --> 03:26:53.920
ASHLEY: Well, let's go kill something, yeah?

03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:55.679
TRAVIS: We're going to the outer wall of the
Tri-Spire.

03:26:55.679 --> 03:26:56.274
MARISHA: What time is it?

03:26:56.724 --> 03:26:59.091
MATT: By now, I'd say it's probably closer to
three in the afternoon--

03:26:59.091 --> 03:27:00.643
LIAM: It's beast killing time!

03:27:00.643 --> 03:27:02.698
MARISHA: Oh, it's beast killing time, yeah!

03:27:02.698 --> 03:27:04.113
TALIESIN: It's time to eat some roast beast.

03:27:04.113 --> 03:27:07.037
TRAVIS: Maybe a late lunch, carb up, and then
let's fucking--

03:27:07.037 --> 03:27:07.625
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:27:07.625 --> 03:27:08.380
TALIESIN: Let's carb up.

03:27:09.490 --> 03:27:10.328
ASHLEY: Pot roast beast?

03:27:10.328 --> 03:27:11.899
LAURA: Guess what, Molly.

03:27:11.899 --> 03:27:12.490
TALIESIN: Hm?

03:27:12.490 --> 03:27:14.380
LAURA: I got a room at The Pillow Trove.

03:27:14.380 --> 03:27:16.665
TALIESIN: Why would you get a room at The Pillow
Trove?

03:27:16.665 --> 03:27:21.458
LAURA: Well, because my package didn't come, so I
thought that maybe if I got a room there, then I

03:27:21.458 --> 03:27:22.885
can check in in the morning as well, maybe?

03:27:22.885 --> 03:27:27.680
TALIESIN: Oh, that's very clever, actually. Well
done. Are you still expecting your package?

03:27:27.680 --> 03:27:30.895
LAURA: Yeah, it's been not enough time, I don't
think.

03:27:30.895 --> 03:27:35.896
TALIESIN: Sometimes I expect things to show up and
then they don't. It can be very disappointing, but

03:27:35.896 --> 03:27:37.541
it's all right. I'm sure it'll show up.

03:27:37.541 --> 03:27:39.250
LAURA: It'll show up, of course it will.

03:27:39.250 --> 03:27:40.534
TALIESIN: Not that it matters if it doesn't.

03:27:41.694 --> 03:27:46.905
ASHLEY: The trick is to not expect anything in
life.

03:27:48.215 --> 03:27:49.745
TALIESIN: I didn't expect you to say that.

03:27:49.745 --> 03:27:50.498
LIAM: That's good advice.

03:27:51.698 --> 03:27:54.267
ASHLEY: Then you'll never be disappointed, you
know?

03:27:54.267 --> 03:27:55.205
TALIESIN: That's very true.

03:27:56.455 --> 03:28:00.581
MARISHA: Yeah, here's to abandoning expectations!

03:28:00.581 --> 03:28:03.152
TRAVIS: Abandoning expectations!

03:28:03.152 --> 03:28:04.661
SAM: Where did we get these drinks?

03:28:04.661 --> 03:28:09.528
(laughter)

03:28:09.528 --> 03:28:10.763
ASHLEY: On the way home from the airport!

03:28:12.463 --> 03:28:18.197
MATT: Taking a little bit of liquid courage as you
muster your weaponry and gather your way to the

03:28:18.197 --> 03:28:28.822
direction to the entry of the sewer where the
currently acquired mercenary contract had been taken.

03:28:28.822 --> 03:28:32.740
MARISHA: Before we enter, Beau says: Wait, should
we have done research on what we're fighting?

03:28:32.740 --> 03:28:33.765
SAM: Nah, we'll be fine.

03:28:33.765 --> 03:28:34.638
MARISHA: All right, let's go!

03:28:34.638 --> 03:28:38.215
(laughter)

03:28:38.215 --> 03:28:39.563
MATT: And that's where we'll pick up next week.

03:28:39.563 --> 03:28:42.256
(cheering)

03:28:42.256 --> 03:28:42.816
TRAVIS: Yasha!

03:28:42.816 --> 03:28:47.120
ALL: Yasha!

03:28:47.120 --> 03:28:51.960
LIAM: Send all of your complaints for not knowing
what would happen in the porno shop to @matthewmercer.

03:28:54.450 --> 03:28:55.355
MATT: Sorry, man!

03:28:56.495 --> 03:28:58.197
LAURA: You just got to get some fancy clothes,
man!

03:28:58.197 --> 03:29:02.696
TALIESIN: I was just waiting for the drop to look
at the shoes and you look back and yep, no, those

03:29:02.696 --> 03:29:03.715
shoes don't get in here.

03:29:03.715 --> 03:29:08.071
TRAVIS: We got to figure out how to get rid of the
Disguise Self blockage, that's a big-- What caused that?

03:29:08.098 --> 03:29:12.668
SAM: We can go over the wall, around the wall,
under the wall--

03:29:12.668 --> 03:29:13.350
TRAVIS: Plus, there are sewers.

03:29:13.350 --> 03:29:15.113
LIAM: The place is crawling with--

03:29:15.113 --> 03:29:17.470
MARISHA: If it's a vicinity thing--

03:29:17.470 --> 03:29:21.209
SAM: We will get you porn, Liam. We will get you
porn.

03:29:21.209 --> 03:29:23.029
TRAVIS: Smut you shall have!

03:29:23.029 --> 03:29:25.501
MARISHA: I agree, I think you just need a nice
coat.

03:29:25.501 --> 03:29:27.038
LIAM: Got to get to that shop, man.

03:29:27.038 --> 03:29:28.523
MARISHA: A nice coat can get you porn.

03:29:28.523 --> 03:29:35.002
MATT: Please continue to try! Not every means to
an end is the easiest and most straightforward, man.

03:29:35.002 --> 03:29:38.776
TALIESIN: When I was young, we would stack three
up and put on a coat.

03:29:38.776 --> 03:29:44.465
MATT: I want this to be an Ocean's Eleven-style,
like three episode mini-arc to get into the smut

03:29:44.465 --> 03:29:46.613
shop, that's what I want.

03:29:46.613 --> 03:29:47.889
(laughter)

03:29:51.179 --> 03:29:53.184
LIAM: Got reasons.

03:29:53.184 --> 03:29:58.675
MATT: Thank you guys so much for watching. Those
I'll see in Kentucky, I'll see you soon. Oh, boy.

03:29:58.675 --> 03:30:04.422
MARISHA: Take care of my boy, home-state. Be good
to him.

03:30:04.422 --> 03:30:07.178
MATT: Be back next week, with Ashley.

03:30:07.178 --> 03:30:08.518
ALL: Yay!

03:30:08.518 --> 03:30:10.647
MATT: Excited to have you home for a little
longer.

03:30:10.647 --> 03:30:12.698
ASHLEY: Yeah! Just a little bit.

03:30:12.698 --> 03:30:20.097
MATT: I missed you. There was something else I was
supposed to talk about.

03:30:20.097 --> 03:30:23.198
SAM: Yes, you were supposed to say something about
giveaways or something.

03:30:23.198 --> 03:30:26.505
MATT: No, I already commented on the giveaway.
What was it?

03:30:26.505 --> 03:30:28.222
SAM: What were you supposed to say?

03:30:28.222 --> 03:30:30.778
MATT: Where'd Lockey go? He was supposed to remind
me of something.

03:30:32.422 --> 03:30:36.729
MATT: Anyway. I'll put it on Twitter if I remember
what it was. Anyway, love you guys, take care of

03:30:36.729 --> 03:30:41.458
yourselves, we'll see you next week, and is it
Thursday yet? Good night.

03:30:41.458 --> 03:30:42.655
LIAM: It still is!

03:30:42.655 --> 03:30:44.496
MATT: We had a bathhouse episode!

03:30:44.496 --> 03:43:45.001

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.995
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:03.916
of Critical Role where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:05.426
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.426 --> 00:00:07.613
(hollering)

5
00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:09.554
SAM: Dragons!

6
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.577
MATT: This just descends into further madness.

7
00:00:12.577 --> 00:00:13.739
LIAM: We're stealing your bit.

8
00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:14.572
I know.
LIAM: Wow.

9
00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:16.753
(laughter)

10
00:00:16.753 --> 00:00:20.136
MATT: Well, tonight's a little crazy,

11
00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:22.109
so let's get into some announcements.

12
00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.212
First and foremost, we have our fantastic returning sponsor

13
00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:25.706
and another returning sponsor,

14
00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:28.774
we have our friends at D&amp;D Beyond, first and foremost,

15
00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:31.316
as they are the top of the episode.

16
00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:32.834
So Sam, if you wouldn't mind.

17
00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:35.833
SAM: Hi everyone, it's me, Sam Riegel.

18
00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:40.416
Last week I was assaulted verbally on this stage--

19
00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:41.279
ASHLEY: Well--

20
00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:45.227
SAM: --by Liam and his attack dog, Ashley Johnson.

21
00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:46.916
ASHLEY: You mean running mate?

22
00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:47.986
SAM: Sure, call it what you will.

23
00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:48.819
LIAM: Not assaulted.

24
00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:49.652
Just salted.

25
00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:51.398
(laughter)

26
00:00:51.398 --> 00:00:55.168
SAM: I could respond tonight with a retort,

27
00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:57.567
but in keeping with the spirit of the night.

28
00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:59.579
It's a positive night. It's filled with love

29
00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.206
and gratefulness to our Critter fans.

30
00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:03.500
I'm not going to do that.

31
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.105
I'm going to do the thing that everyone wants me to do.

32
00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:10.248
It's the thing that I was really put on this earth to do,

33
00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:12.887
which is sing a spoof song about our sponsor.

34
00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:14.738
(laughter)

35
00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:16.702
SAM: That's really what I do best.

36
00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:18.154
MARISHA: Can this one be animated, though?

37
00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:21.030
SAM: Probably not. We'd have to get some rights.

38
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.713
Someone who owns the rights might be here tonight.

39
00:01:24.713 --> 00:01:25.554
Anyway.

40
00:01:25.554 --> 00:01:26.431
TALIESIN: Oh no.

41
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:28.596
SAM: For this song, you might want to turn down your lights,

42
00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:30.886
where applicable.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

43
00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:32.111

82
00:02:51.343 --> 00:02:52.176
Wow.

83
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.539
Just when I thought your campaign couldn't get any staler.

84
00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:56.647
LIAM: A valiant attempt,

85
00:02:56.647 --> 00:02:58.038
A valiant attempt.

86
00:02:58.038 --> 00:02:59.574
Not enough, but a valiant attempt.

91
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.112
TRAVIS: Really, really good.

92
00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:08.847
I feel swayed. I feel swayed.

93
00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:10.905
MATT: That was a good retort.

94
00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:11.978
ASHLEY: That was a great retort.

95
00:03:11.978 --> 00:03:12.811
MATT: But definitely bring it next week,

96
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:13.644
because I think,

97
00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:14.477
I think they're plotting.

98
00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:17.590
TALIESIN: If you have it, bring it.

99
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.994
I mean, if you got it, you should bring it.

100
00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:21.744
SAM: If I got it. I don't know if I got it.

101
00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:23.085
TALIESIN: If you got it, you bring it.

102
00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:25.721
MATT: All right, and thank you D&amp;D Beyond, as always.

103
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:28.495
Our fantastic other returning sponsor this evening,

104
00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:31.084
our friends at The Rook &amp; The Raven.

105
00:03:31.084 --> 00:03:32.542
They have come to help support tonight's episode.

106
00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:34.191
They have their highly-anticipated

107
00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:36.058
Draconic Edition Campaign Planner.

108
00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:37.615
It's now finally available for pre-order.

109
00:03:37.615 --> 00:03:41.356
If you guys haven't seen it, the awesome, leather-bound

110
00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:42.486
dragon design.

111
00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:45.313
MARISHA: Are those bronze rings?

112
00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:46.146
TRAVIS: Leather?

113
00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:48.302
MATT: They are bronze rings. It's so pretty.

114
00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:51.178
The image, I don't know if you all can see it here,

115
00:03:51.178 --> 00:03:53.811
but it's an awesome dragon carved into the leather.

116
00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:55.589
It's really nice.

117
00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.732
It specifically is designed for DMs of any level,

118
00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:00.632
with helpful prompts that are in the margins

119
00:04:00.632 --> 00:04:01.742
to help make it easy for you to plan out

120
00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:05.172
and track your deep, engaging sessions for your campaign.

121
00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:06.596
It comes with a World Builder's kit.

122
00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:09.872
It's got a whole planner build out here for you.

123
00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:12.224
Cool interior with setup and character information,

124
00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:14.754
NPC information that you can put out there.

125
00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.619
It's actually pretty damn handy.

126
00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:17.560
TRAVIS: Marisha never uses them.

127
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.393
Oh wait,

128
00:04:18.393 --> 00:04:19.501
you always use that.
MARISHA: I wants it!

129
00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:20.801
MATT: Well it's like this one right here, maybe,

130
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.849
but you have to go and find it.

131
00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.682
Yeah, check this out, guys.

181
00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:21.741
JOEL: Have a good game here.

182
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:22.574
Good.

183
00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:25.120
(laughter)

184
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.887
MATT: They'll be back.

185
00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:28.107
(laughter)

186
00:06:28.107 --> 00:06:28.981
TRAVIS: Did that really happen?

187
00:06:28.981 --> 00:06:30.181
MATT: Damn right it did.

188
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.264
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

189
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.950
You guys, I hugged him before the show.

190
00:06:38.734 --> 00:06:39.880
MARISHA: He is so nice.

191
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.980
ASHLEY: It took me four times to walk over and say hi.

192
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.653
I kept finding something else to go get.

193
00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:46.656
I was like, I'm going to do that in a second.

194
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.489
MATT: I think you and Brittany both

195
00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:48.322
were doing rounds.
ASHLEY: Yep.

196
00:06:48.322 --> 00:06:50.727
Brittany and I were circling.

197
00:06:50.727 --> 00:06:53.057
MATT: He got to tell me that his son was making

198
00:06:53.057 --> 00:06:56.767
a blood hunter, and I thought that was amazing.

199
00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:57.902
I told him like, very cool.

200
00:06:57.902 --> 00:07:01.260
We'll all look for updates down the road.

201
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.373
Anyway,

202
00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:05.023
on that insane note,

203
00:07:05.023 --> 00:07:08.330
let's dive into tonight's episode of--

204
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.471
TALIESIN: Oh wow.
MATT: Critical Role.

205
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:12.424
LIAM: Everybody sit back and be safe!

206
00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:14.887
(water gurgling)

207
00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:19.712

(dragon roaring)

247
00:08:47.972 --> 00:08:50.022
MATT: And welcome back.

248
00:08:50.022 --> 00:08:52.060
(laughter)

249
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.526
MATT: (sighs)

250
00:08:53.526 --> 00:08:56.116
Surrounded by children.

251
00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:58.941
Anyway, last we left off,

252
00:08:58.941 --> 00:09:02.662
The Mighty Nein had traversed the dangers of Xhorhas,

253
00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:06.069
behind enemy lines, in the struggle that currently resides.

254
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:09.488
The war between the Empire and the Kryn Dynasty.

255
00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:12.872
You made friends, it seems, with the Bright Queen

256
00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:17.460
in a moment of a dangerous downward spiral,

257
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.412
you presented the beacon

258
00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:21.095
that you'd carried since the beginning

259
00:09:21.095 --> 00:09:23.166
and in doing so, gained quite a lot of favor

260
00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:25.143
with the Dynasty.

261
00:09:25.143 --> 00:09:27.381
You were sent to a place to stay.

262
00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:30.645
You were basically given a direction

263
00:09:30.645 --> 00:09:33.200
as to possibly prove yourself further within their eyes

264
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.825
and make yourselves strong allies

265
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.748
within their side of this conflict.

266
00:09:38.748 --> 00:09:41.470
In doing so, you spoke with Professor Waccoh

267
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.496
of the Marble Tomes Conservatory

268
00:09:45.496 --> 00:09:48.189
and were told of an issue

269
00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:51.021
where one of the Steelworks

270
00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:52.599
that'd been developing and designing and building

271
00:09:52.599 --> 00:09:54.407
a lot of the war machines for use in this struggle

272
00:09:54.407 --> 00:09:57.413
had undergone some sort of a giant-based incursion

273
00:09:57.413 --> 00:09:59.580
and had halted production.

274
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.290
That was problematic for both her interests in research

275
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.204
and for the overall effort against the Empire.

276
00:10:06.204 --> 00:10:09.153
You guys were to go and get rid of these giants,

277
00:10:09.153 --> 00:10:11.661
and possibly along the way for a little bonus,

278
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:14.054
embarrass a rival of hers there

279
00:10:14.054 --> 00:10:16.523
as much as possible, the Foreman.

280
00:10:16.523 --> 00:10:19.535
You proceeded to embarrass him fairly well

281
00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.368
in that first meeting.

282
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:24.741
Thankfully, at the hand of the

283
00:10:24.741 --> 00:10:26.532
forceful personality that is Fjord.

284
00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:28.111
TRAVIS: Love you.

285
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:29.220
MATT: You hired a guide and made your way

286
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.785
through the Vermaloc Wildwood,

287
00:10:31.785 --> 00:10:34.083
this lush forest of purple wood trees

288
00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:39.083
with vibrant red and brown and maroon leaves all around you.

289
00:10:40.604 --> 00:10:41.896
Are you okay, Sam?

290
00:10:41.896 --> 00:10:43.722
SAM: Yeah, apparently I'm having a heart attack.

291
00:10:43.722 --> 00:10:46.483
(laughter)

292
00:10:46.483 --> 00:10:48.774
SAM: My watch is trying to save my life for some reason.

293
00:10:48.774 --> 00:10:49.938
(laughter)

294
00:10:49.938 --> 00:10:51.127
LAURA: Are you okay?
SAM: I don't know.

295
00:10:51.127 --> 00:10:52.429
I don't know what that was.

296
00:10:52.429 --> 00:10:54.840
MARISHA: Did you feel your adrenaline?

297
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.909
MATT: Yeah.

298
00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:57.559
LIAM: Sam, calm the fuck down.

299
00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.392
MATT: Yeah.

300
00:10:58.392 --> 00:11:01.390
(laughter)

301
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.046
MATT: You traveled deep into these woods

302
00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:06.001
and discovered the outskirts of the Steelworks,

303
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:07.522
which themselves were built

304
00:11:07.522 --> 00:11:09.570
and attached to a mining camp there

305
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.284
that pulls a number of materials out

306
00:11:11.284 --> 00:11:14.690
that are then transferred throughout the Dynasty,

307
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.435
but largely in the construction of these machines.

308
00:11:17.435 --> 00:11:20.816
There, upon stealthing your way through the front gates,

309
00:11:20.816 --> 00:11:22.704
the outer perimeter of this,

310
00:11:22.704 --> 00:11:24.901
you seem to have been noticed.

311
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:29.478
Or at least Yasha was by one of these stone giants

312
00:11:29.478 --> 00:11:32.180
that resides within the interior.

313
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.169
A boulder was thrown in your direction,

314
00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:35.712
which was not avoided.

315
00:11:35.712 --> 00:11:38.002
You shrugged off some of it, stopped it in place,

316
00:11:38.002 --> 00:11:42.299
and the entity seems to be aware of at least your presence.

317
00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:44.256
The rest of you, out of sight.

318
00:11:44.256 --> 00:11:47.447
As far as you know, your moorbounders

319
00:11:47.447 --> 00:11:50.285
off in the wood not far from you.

320
00:11:50.285 --> 00:11:54.158
You can hear behind the wooden perimeter fence

321
00:11:54.158 --> 00:11:56.996
of this location, the shifting and moving

322
00:11:56.996 --> 00:11:59.249
of the Stone Giants preparing in some way

323
00:11:59.249 --> 00:12:02.048
for whatever lurks out there in the wood.

324
00:12:02.048 --> 00:12:04.251
What are you doing?

325
00:12:04.251 --> 00:12:06.450
TRAVIS: Did they go back behind the walls of the fort?

326
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.247
MATT: They haven't come around the walls.

327
00:12:08.247 --> 00:12:10.443
You've just seen one of them peek out and threw a boulder.

328
00:12:10.443 --> 00:12:11.530
LAURA: Then he walked away?

329
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.725
MATT: Then he backed up, out of sight.

330
00:12:13.725 --> 00:12:15.363
TRAVIS: At their closest to the fence,

331
00:12:15.363 --> 00:12:16.394
when they threw the boulder,

332
00:12:16.394 --> 00:12:18.599
how far were they from Yasha?

333
00:12:18.599 --> 00:12:19.450
MATT: From Yasha?
TRAVIS: Yes.

334
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.092
MATT: About 60 or 70 feet.

335
00:12:22.092 --> 00:12:24.306
TRAVIS: Did we all make it super far away from

336
00:12:24.306 --> 00:12:26.513
where she was? Did we fan out or--?

337
00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:27.360
MATT: You guys began to fan out,

338
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.640
I'd say, about 30 feet between the two groups

339
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.201
before the giant took notice and threw the boulder.

340
00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:35.605
You're not that far from each other.

341
00:12:36.738 --> 00:12:38.699
TRAVIS: 60 feet, huh?
LAURA: How high are the walls?

342
00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:40.404
MATT: The walls themselves are about,

343
00:12:40.404 --> 00:12:42.751
between 12 and 15 feet tall.

344
00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:44.073
The fact that you could see the giant's head

345
00:12:44.073 --> 00:12:46.607
poking over it means they're somewhere

346
00:12:46.607 --> 00:12:48.310
between 15 to 18 feet.

347
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.505
SAM: We were going to stealth in,

348
00:12:49.505 --> 00:12:52.385
but it seems like that's moot at this point.

349
00:12:52.385 --> 00:12:54.332
MARISHA: Yeah, we better pull back

350
00:12:54.332 --> 00:12:55.620
and let things calm down for a minute.

351
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.982
SAM: We could.
ASHLEY: Or I could pretend

352
00:12:56.982 --> 00:12:58.076
it's just me?

353
00:12:58.076 --> 00:13:00.980
SAM: You could be the distraction?

354
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.813
ASHLEY: I don't know.

355
00:13:01.813 --> 00:13:02.646
SAM: You'd do that?

356
00:13:02.646 --> 00:13:04.100
Sacrifice yourself for the greater good?

357
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.538
TRAVIS: Or we could try and take them right now.

358
00:13:05.538 --> 00:13:06.823
MARISHA: No, let's lay low.

359
00:13:06.823 --> 00:13:08.024
We were trying to scout and figure out

360
00:13:08.024 --> 00:13:09.839
how many there actually were.

361
00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:10.954
TALIESIN: Let's have this conversation

362
00:13:10.954 --> 00:13:12.465
while moving away from the--

363
00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:14.850
MATT: You hear the creaking and shifting of rock on rock

364
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.958
as two of the figured have lifted up

365
00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.103
two more boulders over the side

366
00:13:18.103 --> 00:13:20.199
and are both chucking them in the direction

367
00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:21.512
of Yasha once more.

368
00:13:21.512 --> 00:13:22.989
ASHLEY: I'm going to start running.

369
00:13:22.989 --> 00:13:24.489
MATT: Away or towards?

370
00:13:25.967 --> 00:13:27.829
ASHLEY: Ooh, towards!

371
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:28.662
TRAVIS: (yelling) Yeah!

372
00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:30.256
(laughter)

373
00:13:30.256 --> 00:13:31.089
TALIESIN: Okay.

374
00:13:31.089 --> 00:13:32.755
MATT: So in this moment, as the two heads peek up,

375
00:13:32.755 --> 00:13:34.122
the rocks being lifted up,

376
00:13:34.122 --> 00:13:37.358
Yasha, split decision, head down, charges headlong

377
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:40.597
out of cover towards the front of this--

378
00:13:40.597 --> 00:13:43.344
TRAVIS: I will break cover and run from the treeline

379
00:13:43.344 --> 00:13:45.264
at the same time as you do.

380
00:13:45.264 --> 00:13:46.976
ASHLEY: Oh no, okay!
MATT: All right, well,

381
00:13:46.976 --> 00:13:48.763
we are now in initiative order, then.

382
00:13:48.763 --> 00:13:49.596
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

383
00:13:49.596 --> 00:13:50.489
MATT: Go ahead and roll initiative, guys.

384
00:13:50.489 --> 00:13:52.325
TRAVIS: Yeah!

385
00:13:52.325 --> 00:13:53.158
SAM: Guys, (clears throat).

386
00:13:53.158 --> 00:13:53.991
LIAM: That's not what

387
00:13:53.991 --> 00:13:54.824
we planned at all.

388
00:13:54.824 --> 00:13:56.630
SAM: Well since, guys, since we are going into combat,

389
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.985
I should tell everyone that this combat

390
00:13:58.985 --> 00:14:01.176
is powered by Dwarven Forge.

391
00:14:01.176 --> 00:14:06.166
They currently have a 406 page free PDF module

392
00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:07.948
tied to their Dungeon of Doom product

393
00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:09.593
available now on their website,

394
00:14:09.593 --> 00:14:11.593
and you'll see why.
MARISHA: Oh!

395
00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:14.607
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

396
00:14:14.607 --> 00:14:16.309
Tones of autumn.

397
00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:18.642
MATT: Yasha, you were back here.

398
00:14:19.998 --> 00:14:22.617
The rest of you decide amongst the sides

399
00:14:22.617 --> 00:14:26.918
where you would like to be, back in the wood.

400
00:14:26.918 --> 00:14:27.751
MARISHA: Shit.

401
00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:28.951
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

402
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.321
MATT: If you don't mind.

403
00:14:31.321 --> 00:14:33.279
MARISHA: Where are these two teams?

404
00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.543
MATT: Beyond this board is the tree line, so--

405
00:14:35.543 --> 00:14:36.901
LAURA: Where are you, Fjord?

406
00:14:36.901 --> 00:14:38.802
TRAVIS: I'm the same distance that Yasha is from--

407
00:14:38.802 --> 00:14:39.635
LAURA: Yeah, but on this side?

408
00:14:39.635 --> 00:14:40.468
MARISHA: We were together, right?

409
00:14:40.468 --> 00:14:41.301
MATT: On that side.

410
00:14:41.301 --> 00:14:43.200
MARISHA: It split. We started going other ways.

411
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.577
TALIESIN: I'm over there.

412
00:14:44.577 --> 00:14:46.012
LIAM: I think we were that way.

413
00:14:46.012 --> 00:14:47.925
TALIESIN: I'll be there with Beau.

414
00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:49.241
LAURA: Caleb was?

415
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:51.602
LIAM: In the, yeah, I was with Beauregard.

416
00:14:51.602 --> 00:14:53.239
SAM: Do I have a figurine somewhere?

417
00:14:53.239 --> 00:14:54.221
MATT: Right over here.

418
00:14:54.221 --> 00:14:55.106
LIAM: Not anymore, not anymore.

419
00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:56.149
MARISHA: Yeah, I think so, too.

420
00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:57.182
LAURA: I'm outside,

421
00:14:57.182 --> 00:14:58.327
so I'm going to switch this.

422
00:14:58.327 --> 00:14:59.325
Is that okay, Matt?

423
00:14:59.325 --> 00:15:00.711
I switched Yasha and--

424
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:01.771
SAM: Put me near Jessie.

425
00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:03.085
MATT: That's fine.

426
00:15:03.085 --> 00:15:04.476
LIAM: That's what I believe.

427
00:15:04.476 --> 00:15:05.756
TALIESIN: Yeah, Jessie's in the trees.

428
00:15:05.756 --> 00:15:09.727
MATT: Initiative order, guys?

429
00:15:09.727 --> 00:15:13.148
Okay, so we have 25 to 20?

430
00:15:13.148 --> 00:15:13.981
MARISHA: 20.

431
00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:15.832
MATT: All right, Beauregard first.

432
00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:19.205
LIAM: Yes.

433
00:15:19.205 --> 00:15:22.616
MATT: All right, that would be now 20, 15?

434
00:15:22.616 --> 00:15:24.534
TRAVIS: 18.

435
00:15:24.534 --> 00:15:25.559
ASHLEY: 18!

436
00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:27.632
SAM: Oh, perfect.

437
00:15:27.632 --> 00:15:31.479
Works with the story and everything.

438
00:15:32.491 --> 00:15:33.769
ASHLEY: I did it, too.

439
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:34.602
TALIESIN: 17.

440
00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:35.802
MATT: 17 for Caduceus.

441
00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:37.585
TALIESIN: Yeah, fudge.

442
00:15:37.585 --> 00:15:39.360
MATT: 15 to ten?

443
00:15:41.146 --> 00:15:42.710
Ten to five?

444
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.981
LAURA: Six.
LIAM: Mighty Nein!

445
00:15:44.981 --> 00:15:46.747
MATT: All right, so--

446
00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:48.770
SAM: I had a natural one, which makes it five.

447
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.315
MATT: Okay. All right, so we have Caleb.

448
00:15:53.315 --> 00:15:54.731
TALIESIN: You have two of those

449
00:15:54.731 --> 00:15:57.249
and two of those--
MATT: Jester.

450
00:15:57.249 --> 00:15:59.657
Then Nott.

451
00:15:59.657 --> 00:16:01.519
LAURA: Fuck.

452
00:16:03.691 --> 00:16:04.527
SAM: Fuck.

453
00:16:04.527 --> 00:16:07.440
MATT: All righty.

454
00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:12.405
Top of the round. Beauregard,

455
00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:15.146
you see now Yasha begins darting out of the wood

456
00:16:15.146 --> 00:16:17.791
and you see Fjord making a split decision

457
00:16:17.791 --> 00:16:19.317
and then going to join.

458
00:16:19.317 --> 00:16:20.395
What are you doing on your turn?

459
00:16:20.395 --> 00:16:23.836
MARISHA: I go: (sarcastically) be patient! Listen!

460
00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:25.191
Find shit out,

461
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.814
and all that shit that Dairon said.

462
00:16:26.814 --> 00:16:29.377
And then I take off running as well.

463
00:16:29.377 --> 00:16:32.273
MATT: Okay.

464
00:16:32.273 --> 00:16:35.352
MARISHA: Can I, (laughing)

465
00:16:35.352 --> 00:16:37.281
can I do some parkour shit

466
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:39.149
and see if I can vault off this

467
00:16:39.149 --> 00:16:40.494
and vault off this and make a go?

468
00:16:40.494 --> 00:16:41.841
MATT: Make an acrobatics check,

469
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:43.286
hand me the mini.
LAURA: You're going in?

470
00:16:43.286 --> 00:16:44.477
What if there's like ten of them in there?

471
00:16:44.477 --> 00:16:45.310
MATT: Hand me the mini, please?

472
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.451
TRAVIS: That's more of us to kill.

473
00:16:46.451 --> 00:16:49.850
MATT: That'd be five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30

474
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:51.486
to try and vault up there.

475
00:16:51.486 --> 00:16:53.641
Roll and acrobatics check for me, if you don't mind.

476
00:16:53.641 --> 00:16:56.467
MARISHA: Roll for acrobatics?

477
00:16:56.467 --> 00:16:57.366
MATT: Yes.

478
00:16:57.366 --> 00:16:58.499
MARISHA: 14.

479
00:16:58.499 --> 00:17:01.074
MATT: 14? You will get up to the top,

480
00:17:01.074 --> 00:17:05.924
but it'll cost you three, 15 feet of movement to do so.

481
00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:07.585
You dart off the rock, up the side,

482
00:17:07.585 --> 00:17:08.899
and you climb up, so at speed,

483
00:17:08.899 --> 00:17:13.407
you're now at 35 feet at top there.

484
00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:16.532
Your full speed is what, 45? You have ten more feet to move.

485
00:17:16.532 --> 00:17:20.090
MARISHA: Ew, shit.
SAM: You can't hit them.

486
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:21.583
TALIESIN: But you have ranged now.

487
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:23.102
LAURA: Can you run along the top of the wall?

488
00:17:23.102 --> 00:17:28.060
MARISHA: Oh yeah. That's cool! Yeah, I'll do that!

489
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.208
I'll do what Laura said,

490
00:17:29.208 --> 00:17:30.745
I'm going to run along and try and go here,

491
00:17:30.745 --> 00:17:33.292
split the difference, and do Patient Defense.

492
00:17:33.292 --> 00:17:35.130
This is stupid as fuck.

493
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.101
SAM: Balancing on a beam?
LIAM: That's so fucking cool.

494
00:17:38.101 --> 00:17:41.277
MARISHA: Yeah, I got like the crane pose going on.

495
00:17:41.277 --> 00:17:44.151
My foot's wedged in between the posts.

496
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:47.953
MATT: Okay. As you're standing there, toe on toe on top,

497
00:17:47.953 --> 00:17:49.189
getting ready, you use your ki point

498
00:17:49.189 --> 00:17:50.473
to do Patient Defense as a bonus action, correct?

499
00:17:50.473 --> 00:17:51.306
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

500
00:17:51.306 --> 00:17:54.581
MATT: You also glace forward and notice the third giant

501
00:17:54.581 --> 00:17:55.861
that is in the back.

502
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:58.319
Seems slightly smaller than the other two

503
00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:00.744
and is currently holding a staff in their arms

504
00:18:00.744 --> 00:18:03.646
that is covered in knotted furs

505
00:18:03.646 --> 00:18:05.283
and bone trinkets that are dangling from it

506
00:18:05.283 --> 00:18:07.613
from different threads of leather.

507
00:18:07.613 --> 00:18:09.221
MARISHA: I go: Oh, there's a third!

508
00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:10.331
To the rest of the group.

509
00:18:10.331 --> 00:18:12.413
MATT: That ends Beau's turn. Yes?

510
00:18:12.413 --> 00:18:14.115
LAURA: Are giants considered humanoid?

511
00:18:14.115 --> 00:18:15.860
MATT: They are considered giants.

512
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.401
TRAVIS: That's a no.

513
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:20.199
LAURA: But they look like humans, only big?

514
00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:23.658
MATT: Correct, but they are considered giants. Sorry.

515
00:18:23.658 --> 00:18:25.237
LAURA: I was just checking.

516
00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:27.178
SAM: Question. From my perspective,

517
00:18:27.178 --> 00:18:30.660
since I'm three feet tall, have I ever seen the giants?

518
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.392
MATT: Actually, you've seen them when they've come up

519
00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:34.675
to the edge to see Yasha,

520
00:18:34.675 --> 00:18:35.759
and when they throw the boulders,

521
00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:37.286
because they're leaning over to chuck them.

522
00:18:37.286 --> 00:18:38.309
You have seen them, yes.

523
00:18:38.309 --> 00:18:39.699
SAM: Right now, I'm like?

524
00:18:39.699 --> 00:18:41.018
MATT: Right now you're like,

525
00:18:41.018 --> 00:18:42.304
they're somewhere.
SAM: I am behind a wall.

526
00:18:42.304 --> 00:18:43.778
MATT: Yeah. You see Beau jump up there

527
00:18:43.778 --> 00:18:45.242
and go, uh?
SAM: Okay, cool.

528
00:18:45.242 --> 00:18:48.360
TRAVIS: Can I use my 30 feet of movement

529
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.503
to continue my path towards the wall?

530
00:18:51.503 --> 00:18:54.380
I'm over here.
MATT: Sure.

531
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.979
TRAVIS: Looks like that's 25.
MATT: 25.

532
00:18:55.979 --> 00:18:57.273
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action,

533
00:18:57.273 --> 00:19:01.240
Misty Step, to bamf up 40 feet above.

534
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.954
Actually, just to the top of the fence,

535
00:19:02.954 --> 00:19:05.251
so that I have visual range on--

536
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:06.529
Let's go right up here.

537
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:08.153
MATT: Here? Okay.

538
00:19:08.153 --> 00:19:10.961
TRAVIS: I'd like to be within 30 feet of both of them.

539
00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:11.927
MATTT: You've got it.

540
00:19:11.927 --> 00:19:15.346
This'll be a trick I learned from Brennan.

541
00:19:15.346 --> 00:19:18.250
TRAVIS: Now I have a question for you, Mr. Mercer.

542
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.142
MATT: Yes?
TRAVIS: Because none of us

543
00:19:19.142 --> 00:19:21.087
have attacked them yet,

544
00:19:21.087 --> 00:19:24.516
are we considered, are we fighting them?

545
00:19:24.516 --> 00:19:27.494
MATT: You have initiated combat,

546
00:19:27.494 --> 00:19:28.540
they are aware there is a threat,

547
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.075
and you guys are coming at them in a threatening manner,

548
00:19:30.075 --> 00:19:31.677
so this would be considered combat.

549
00:19:31.677 --> 00:19:36.593
TRAVIS: YOLO, I will cast Charm Monster at 5th-level

550
00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:38.376
and target both of them.

551
00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:40.642
SAM: Charm Monster, to both of them?

552
00:19:40.642 --> 00:19:44.376
TRAVIS: Yeah, which is a wisdom saving throw of 17

553
00:19:44.376 --> 00:19:46.087
and lasts for an hour.

554
00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:49.385
But they get advantage because we're fighting them.

555
00:19:49.385 --> 00:19:50.490
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: I was thinking about

556
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.269
doing it before we were fighting them,

557
00:19:52.269 --> 00:19:53.102
but shit happened.

558
00:19:53.102 --> 00:19:57.808
MATT: The first one rolled a natural one, and a 14.

559
00:19:57.808 --> 00:19:59.495
This one does not succeed.
ASHLEY: No way!

560
00:19:59.495 --> 00:20:02.137
MATT: This one--
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

561
00:20:02.137 --> 00:20:04.013
MATT: Neither of them succeed.

562
00:20:04.013 --> 00:20:05.845
(cheering)

563
00:20:05.845 --> 00:20:09.403
TRAVIS: Fjord is the house!

564
00:20:09.403 --> 00:20:11.236
TALIESIN: Fjord, you made friends!

565
00:20:11.236 --> 00:20:14.001
TRAVIS: I did spells real good!

566
00:20:14.001 --> 00:20:16.970
TALIESIN: Oh my god.
MATT: As you leap up on top,

567
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.443
with your falchion to one side,

568
00:20:18.443 --> 00:20:20.001
you reach your hand out and you watch this

569
00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:21.835
sickly green energy gather

570
00:20:21.835 --> 00:20:24.051
and then spiral out towards both of them.

571
00:20:24.051 --> 00:20:26.105
It wraps into their eyes and their ears

572
00:20:26.105 --> 00:20:27.412
and inside their mouth and nose,

573
00:20:27.412 --> 00:20:29.078
and they inhale the energy. (inhales deeply)

574
00:20:29.078 --> 00:20:31.146
As they do, their physical demeanor goes

575
00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:33.404
from defensive to dropped to just confused.

576
00:20:33.404 --> 00:20:37.768
TRAVIS: Hey boys, what do you say we play real nice?

577
00:20:37.768 --> 00:20:39.091
They just chill.

578
00:20:39.091 --> 00:20:41.839
MATT: Yeah, they both put down their aggressiveness

579
00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:44.684
towards you, but they still look towards Beau.

580
00:20:44.684 --> 00:20:47.679
Like, they're not aggressive towards you right now.

581
00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:51.228
TRAVIS: Okay. Friendly to me, right. Shit, okay, cool.

582
00:20:51.228 --> 00:20:52.556
Never done that before!

583
00:20:52.556 --> 00:20:54.336
MATT: Okay, that finished your turn, Fjord?

584
00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:55.169
TRAVIS: Yes.

585
00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:56.002
MATT: Yasha, what are you doing?

586
00:20:56.002 --> 00:20:56.835
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

587
00:20:56.835 --> 00:20:58.178
MARISHA: Those two?

588
00:20:58.178 --> 00:21:00.266
(excited exclaiming)

589
00:21:00.266 --> 00:21:02.307
MATT: That was awesome.

590
00:21:02.307 --> 00:21:03.929
SAM: Wait, they can still fight,

591
00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:04.922
but just not against Fjord?

592
00:21:04.922 --> 00:21:06.223
How does this work?

593
00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:09.015
MATT: They treat Fjord as a valued ally.

594
00:21:09.015 --> 00:21:10.215
TRAVIS: For an hour.

595
00:21:10.215 --> 00:21:12.471
MATT: Which means you can give directions to them,

596
00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.724
as an ally, when it comes around to it.

597
00:21:14.724 --> 00:21:16.782
They'll probably listen to you to a certain degree,

598
00:21:16.782 --> 00:21:18.664
unless it goes against their better judgment

599
00:21:18.664 --> 00:21:21.531
and person sense of self preservation.

600
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.490
TRAVIS: Right, their moral code.

601
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.615
SAM: If they speak Common.

602
00:21:24.615 --> 00:21:26.255
MATT: Which you'll find out soon.

603
00:21:26.255 --> 00:21:29.203
LIAM: Yee-haw.
SAM: Shit.

604
00:21:29.203 --> 00:21:31.253
LIAM: Welcome to the Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

605
00:21:31.253 --> 00:21:35.032
(laughter)
(applause)

606
00:21:35.032 --> 00:21:38.663
TRAVIS: Beware the rift!

607
00:21:38.663 --> 00:21:40.136
MATT: Yasha?
ASHLEY: Okay, all right.

608
00:21:40.136 --> 00:21:41.972
I'm going to make my movement

609
00:21:41.972 --> 00:21:44.997
and try to get to the inside top of the fence,

610
00:21:44.997 --> 00:21:46.693
like where the little lip is?

611
00:21:46.693 --> 00:21:48.516
MATT: Right, ten, 15, straight towards it, 20.

612
00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:50.242
Go ahead and make an athletics

613
00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:52.347
or acrobatics check, athletics to try

614
00:21:52.347 --> 00:21:55.742
and climb up the side.

615
00:21:55.742 --> 00:21:56.867
And jump.
ASHLEY: 19?

616
00:21:56.867 --> 00:21:57.964
MATT: 19, yeah.

617
00:21:57.964 --> 00:21:59.749
You you leap,

618
00:21:59.749 --> 00:22:01.707
make most of the way, and then clamber up the rest

619
00:22:01.707 --> 00:22:03.648
of the distance.
ASHLEY: Okay.

620
00:22:03.648 --> 00:22:05.486
MATT: Drawing Magician's Judge as you do so,

621
00:22:05.486 --> 00:22:06.634
getting up onto the top.
ASHLEY: Yes.

622
00:22:06.634 --> 00:22:08.224
MATT: With that movement there,

623
00:22:08.224 --> 00:22:09.057
you have five more feet.

624
00:22:09.057 --> 00:22:10.592
You could hop down, because there is a walkway

625
00:22:10.592 --> 00:22:11.536
on the other side of the fence.

626
00:22:11.536 --> 00:22:12.962
ASHLEY: Yes, I'll hop down to the walkway.

627
00:22:12.962 --> 00:22:16.887
MATT: All right. That's your movement.

628
00:22:16.887 --> 00:22:18.904
ASHLEY: I--

629
00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:22.428
I would like to rage.

630
00:22:22.428 --> 00:22:23.717
TRAVIS: (roaring)

631
00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:26.206
MATT: Yeah, bonus action rage, you got it.

632
00:22:26.206 --> 00:22:31.052
ASHLEY: Then, as an action, can I drink this healing potion?

633
00:22:31.052 --> 00:22:32.528
MATT: If you'd like to.

634
00:22:32.528 --> 00:22:33.635
SAM: Oh, because you got hit!

635
00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:35.936
ASHLEY: I got hit. I forgot until right now.

636
00:22:35.936 --> 00:22:37.834
MATT: Yeah, you can go ahead.
ASHLEY: Okay.

637
00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:40.323
TRAVIS: Charm Monster is not concentration.

638
00:22:40.323 --> 00:22:42.792
MATT: Correct. I thought you were saying

639
00:22:42.792 --> 00:22:44.984
it was concentration.
TRAVIS: Oh no, sorry.

640
00:22:44.984 --> 00:22:46.768
No, I was saying to Beau.
MATT: Gotcha.

641
00:22:46.768 --> 00:22:49.931
TRAVIS: Because she fell off the fence.

642
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:51.705
MATT: Yeah, you're good.

643
00:22:51.705 --> 00:22:53.525
Yasha, is that your turn?

644
00:22:53.525 --> 00:22:55.009
ASHLEY: That's my turn.

645
00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:56.209
MATT: Your potion is spent?
ASHLEY: Yes.

646
00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:57.861
MATT: You got it.
SAM: Aww,

647
00:22:57.861 --> 00:22:59.290
that's sort of nice, though.

648
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.422
ASHLEY: It's really nice.
MATT: You can buy more.

649
00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:02.229
ASHLEY: That's better, it's better, it's better.

650
00:23:02.229 --> 00:23:03.311
MATT: Okay, that finishes Yasha's.

651
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:05.160
We're up to Caduceus. It's your turn.

652
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.151
TALIESIN: Oh boy, I don't understand

653
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:09.844
anything that's going on.

654
00:23:09.844 --> 00:23:12.168
That all happened real quick.

655
00:23:12.168 --> 00:23:16.342
I guess I'm going to

656
00:23:16.342 --> 00:23:18.900
make my way to behind the fence.

657
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.086
I'm going to run up to the fence

658
00:23:20.086 --> 00:23:21.725
and try and get cover there.

659
00:23:21.725 --> 00:23:23.600
MATT: 20, 25, 30.

660
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.041
Okay, you do not have a visual on

661
00:23:25.041 --> 00:23:27.321
anything beyond that fence.

662
00:23:27.321 --> 00:23:28.838
So it's too high for you to see them.

663
00:23:28.838 --> 00:23:29.879
TALIESIN: I can see Beau

664
00:23:29.879 --> 00:23:32.210
and I can see, is that Yasha?

665
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.456
MATT: You can barely see the top of Yasha.

666
00:23:33.456 --> 00:23:35.053
Maybe like three inches of the top of her head.

667
00:23:35.053 --> 00:23:36.191
She is within visual range.

668
00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:37.433
TALIESIN: I have Beau and Yasha.

669
00:23:37.433 --> 00:23:42.036
Okay, just to make sure that things are good--

670
00:23:42.036 --> 00:23:43.355
Oh, and can I see Fjord, too?

671
00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:45.864
MATT: Yeah, you all can see Fjord.

672
00:23:45.864 --> 00:23:47.830
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a quick Bless

673
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.580
on the three of them, just so everything's all--

674
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.099
MATT: Sure, go for it. All right.

675
00:23:51.099 --> 00:23:54.472
TALIESIN: Let's cast Bless.

676
00:23:54.472 --> 00:23:58.474
That means that you guys now have,

677
00:23:58.474 --> 00:24:02.845
you guys add a d4 to your attack rolls

678
00:24:02.845 --> 00:24:04.242
and saving throws.
ASHLEY: Hell yeah.

679
00:24:04.242 --> 00:24:05.495
TRAVIS: Sweet.

680
00:24:05.495 --> 00:24:06.828
MATT: All righty.

681
00:24:09.504 --> 00:24:10.511
That ends your turn, Caduceus?

682
00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:12.910
TALIESIN: I, yeah, I think that's everything.

683
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.118
TRAVIS: Attacks and savings throws?

684
00:24:14.118 --> 00:24:15.872
TALIESIN: Yeah, attacks and saving throws.

685
00:24:15.872 --> 00:24:18.302
MATT: The giant in the back takes their turn.

686
00:24:18.302 --> 00:24:20.630
You can see now at a better visual range,

687
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.673
this one appears to be a female giant,

688
00:24:23.673 --> 00:24:26.395
female stone giant, steps forward

689
00:24:26.395 --> 00:24:28.783
and starts shouting. Does anybody here speak Giant?

690
00:24:28.783 --> 00:24:30.038
SAM: Looking.
MARISHA: No.

691
00:24:30.038 --> 00:24:31.287
TALIESIN: I do!
MATT: You do?

692
00:24:31.287 --> 00:24:32.537
TALIESIN: I do.
MATT: Yes, you do.

693
00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:34.095
MARISHA: Yay!
MATT: You hear,

694
00:24:34.095 --> 00:24:35.852
you guys, the rest of you hear,

695
00:24:35.852 --> 00:24:37.011
"(speaking Giant)"

696
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:39.107
You hear the translation of them saying,

697
00:24:39.107 --> 00:24:43.778
"The two of you, protect us, knock them back."

698
00:24:43.778 --> 00:24:45.737
LAURA: Wow, they sound smart.

699
00:24:45.737 --> 00:24:49.583
TRAVIS: "The two of you protect <i>us.</i>"

700
00:24:49.583 --> 00:24:52.069
MATT: Just going to--let's see here.

701
00:24:52.069 --> 00:24:54.395
TALIESIN: Oh god, they're going to try and hit us, okay.

702
00:24:54.395 --> 00:24:58.429
MATT: The one back there, looking up into the

703
00:24:58.429 --> 00:25:01.665
open sky above, the clouds already there,

704
00:25:01.665 --> 00:25:04.873
is going to--actually no.

705
00:25:04.873 --> 00:25:07.601
It's not going to do that. Instead, is going to

706
00:25:07.601 --> 00:25:09.844
cast Disrupting Earth.

707
00:25:09.844 --> 00:25:11.469
TRAVIS: Cast what?

708
00:25:11.469 --> 00:25:12.708
MARISHA: Disrupting Earth.

709
00:25:12.708 --> 00:25:14.517
That's some like druid shit, I think.

710
00:25:14.517 --> 00:25:15.350
TALIESIN: You're a mountain.

711
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.316
ASHLEY: I'm a mountain, that's right.

712
00:25:17.316 --> 00:25:21.082
MATT: So... Looking--

713
00:25:21.082 --> 00:25:22.447
LAURA: Your spells are even bigger?

714
00:25:22.447 --> 00:25:24.497
MATT: No, there's not enough people on the ground.

715
00:25:24.497 --> 00:25:26.813
So instead...

716
00:25:28.376 --> 00:25:30.793
is going to cast Hold Person.

717
00:25:32.101 --> 00:25:35.728
At a 3rd-level. She'll use a 3rd-level slot.

718
00:25:35.728 --> 00:25:37.044
SAM: Oh no.

719
00:25:37.044 --> 00:25:42.044
MATT: I will need both Fjord and Yasha,

720
00:25:42.134 --> 00:25:43.965
both of you guys to make wisdom saving throws, please.

721
00:25:43.965 --> 00:25:45.467
TALIESIN: With a d4.

722
00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:46.544
MATT: With an additional d4 added to it,

723
00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.095
because you just got blessed.

724
00:25:48.095 --> 00:25:49.991
TRAVIS: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

725
00:25:49.991 --> 00:25:52.052
Ew.

726
00:25:52.052 --> 00:25:53.835
Ugh, 11.

727
00:25:53.835 --> 00:25:55.422
MATT: That's a failure.

728
00:25:55.422 --> 00:25:56.940
ASHLEY: But--

729
00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.730
Do I add four?
TALIESIN: Add your d4.

730
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.111
SAM: You can't give instructions to the giants now.

731
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:04.084
MATT: That's true, actually.

732
00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:07.829
ASHLEY: So it's 18, right, then minus one?

733
00:26:07.829 --> 00:26:10.912
18.
MATT: 18, you succeed.

734
00:26:10.912 --> 00:26:14.117
MATT: Fjord, as they both turn, you go,

735
00:26:14.117 --> 00:26:18.010
"All right (groans)," and your lungs lock up,

736
00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.180
you can barely breathe.

737
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.951
All of your focus is going toward

738
00:26:20.951 --> 00:26:22.748
just making your lungs expand and contract to bring air in.

739
00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:23.998
TRAVIS: Please tell me I'm on

740
00:26:23.998 --> 00:26:25.649
a balanced position before I lock up and

741
00:26:25.649 --> 00:26:28.367
I'm not just slowly...

742
00:26:28.367 --> 00:26:32.171
MATT: Yes, because you were straddling the peak of it.

743
00:26:32.171 --> 00:26:35.233
to keep balance, so yeah. You're still locked in place.

744
00:26:35.233 --> 00:26:36.383
It's a little precarious.

745
00:26:36.383 --> 00:26:38.636
If a heavy wind were to blow, we'd have to start rolling.

746
00:26:38.636 --> 00:26:40.383
So far it's a little still in the sky.

747
00:26:40.383 --> 00:26:41.675
TRAVIS: Oh god.

748
00:26:41.675 --> 00:26:43.438
MATT: You, however, do resist it.

749
00:26:43.438 --> 00:26:45.158
The rage in your mind manages you

750
00:26:45.158 --> 00:26:47.302
to shrug it off without issue.

751
00:26:47.302 --> 00:26:48.456
All you're still seeing

752
00:26:48.456 --> 00:26:50.368
is the red filter over everything in front of you.

753
00:26:50.368 --> 00:26:55.318
With that, the giant's going to move over this way.

754
00:26:56.867 --> 00:26:58.981
Actually, yeah, about there, at 40 feet.

755
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:00.374
It's starting to just move away

756
00:27:00.374 --> 00:27:02.216
from the rest of them, ending its turn.

757
00:27:02.216 --> 00:27:03.749
Caleb, you're up.

758
00:27:03.749 --> 00:27:05.327
LIAM: Okay, well I do not know what happened to them,

759
00:27:05.327 --> 00:27:07.220
so I am going to continue with my plan,

760
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.273
which is to march straight towards the door.

761
00:27:09.273 --> 00:27:12.577
Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

762
00:27:12.577 --> 00:27:15.335
On the way, I am pulling out the flower

763
00:27:15.335 --> 00:27:18.496
from a catmint plant and crushing it in my hand,

764
00:27:18.496 --> 00:27:19.635
and muttering to myself,

765
00:27:19.635 --> 00:27:21.332
and for a split second there is a vision

766
00:27:21.332 --> 00:27:23.476
of a curled Frumpkin hovering in the air,

767
00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:27.760
and it explodes out into a gigantic cat's claw

768
00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.282
that is orange-ish brown burnt umber.

769
00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:33.203
That claw is going to rend the shit out of the gates

770
00:27:33.203 --> 00:27:34.809
and try to open it.

771
00:27:34.809 --> 00:27:36.687
MATT: Okay, what spell is this? This is?

772
00:27:36.687 --> 00:27:38.353
LIAM: Cat's Ire. We discussed.

773
00:27:38.353 --> 00:27:39.861
MATT: Oh, right! Yes, yes indeed.

774
00:27:39.861 --> 00:27:41.827
TALIESIN: "Cat's Ire we discussed."

775
00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:44.773
SAM: Is that a real spell? Are we off the map?

776
00:27:44.773 --> 00:27:46.439
Are we off the grid? What's going on?

777
00:27:46.439 --> 00:27:47.322
TRAVIS: It's D-I-S-G, Beavis.

778
00:27:47.322 --> 00:27:48.948
MATT: This?
LIAM: Sure.

779
00:27:48.948 --> 00:27:50.379
MATT: All right.

780
00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:52.078
TALIESIN: Meow.

781
00:27:52.078 --> 00:27:56.216
MATT: Roll for the attack on the door.

782
00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:58.623
LIAM: I rolled a 19.

783
00:27:58.623 --> 00:28:00.848
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Roll full damage.

784
00:28:00.848 --> 00:28:02.943
LIAM: (repeatedly) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

785
00:28:02.943 --> 00:28:04.638
SAM: The cat's claw is made out of dirt?

786
00:28:04.638 --> 00:28:05.716
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

787
00:28:05.716 --> 00:28:06.662
SAM: That's a dirty pussy.

788
00:28:06.662 --> 00:28:08.829
MATT: Sam.
SAM: Sorry.

789
00:28:11.772 --> 00:28:14.028
TALIESIN: That was so good.
LIAM: 23.

790
00:28:14.028 --> 00:28:15.637
MATT: 23 points of damage?

791
00:28:15.637 --> 00:28:18.522
All right, the door splinters.

792
00:28:18.522 --> 00:28:20.378
It actually breaks inward.

793
00:28:20.378 --> 00:28:22.425
From what you can tell,

794
00:28:22.425 --> 00:28:25.093
one, there is a slat held in place

795
00:28:25.093 --> 00:28:26.501
that is partially cracked,

796
00:28:26.501 --> 00:28:28.000
and from that little gap you can see,

797
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.414
there is actually a pile of stones

798
00:28:29.414 --> 00:28:31.722
that have been pressed up against the door.

799
00:28:31.722 --> 00:28:33.229
Which means, one more round,

800
00:28:33.229 --> 00:28:34.660
you could probably break through,

801
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.917
but this is reinforced specifically

802
00:28:35.917 --> 00:28:38.278
to hold back quite a bit of damage.

803
00:28:38.278 --> 00:28:39.295
LIAM: That is the end of my turn.

804
00:28:39.295 --> 00:28:41.134
MATT: All right, that ends Caleb's go. Jester, you're up.

805
00:28:41.134 --> 00:28:46.134
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to turn to Nott,

806
00:28:46.659 --> 00:28:48.924
and I'm going to say:

807
00:28:48.924 --> 00:28:52.081
Do you trust me?

808
00:28:52.081 --> 00:28:54.021
SAM: Fluffernutter.

809
00:28:54.021 --> 00:28:56.945
LAURA: I'm going to cast Dimension Door

810
00:28:56.945 --> 00:28:59.375
and bring us up to the top of this, inside.

811
00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:01.766
MATT: Inside, okay. Up in the very, very top?

812
00:29:01.766 --> 00:29:03.340
Or in the middle place?

813
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.173
LAURA: In the very, very top.

814
00:29:04.173 --> 00:29:05.404
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Does that come with

815
00:29:05.404 --> 00:29:07.625
Aladdin fuck me eyes?

816
00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:09.493
MATT: Go ahead and hand me your mini,

817
00:29:09.493 --> 00:29:11.004
if you don't mind.
LAURA: Do you trust me?

818
00:29:11.004 --> 00:29:13.947
♪ I can open your eyes ♪

819
00:29:13.947 --> 00:29:15.631
MATT: You guys are currently up now.

820
00:29:15.631 --> 00:29:19.392
Inside this floor up here, you can see there is a--

821
00:29:19.392 --> 00:29:20.800
LAURA: There are windows, right?

822
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.948
Little slits?
MATT: Yeah, little slits

823
00:29:21.948 --> 00:29:23.258
you can see through.

824
00:29:23.258 --> 00:29:26.108
There is a ladder that leads down into the

825
00:29:26.108 --> 00:29:29.158
lower regions of this tower.

826
00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:32.597
So that's your Dimension Door. It's your action.

827
00:29:32.597 --> 00:29:33.888
You haven't moved, if you had movement at all

828
00:29:33.888 --> 00:29:34.838
you wanted to use, or a bonus action.

829
00:29:34.838 --> 00:29:37.571
LAURA: I'm going to go up and look through the window.

830
00:29:37.571 --> 00:29:38.524
MATT: You're surveying,

831
00:29:38.524 --> 00:29:39.791
you have a very clear view of this,

832
00:29:39.791 --> 00:29:41.970
and you see the rest of the layout, too.

833
00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:45.272
This is a large field and there's blacksmithies,

834
00:29:45.272 --> 00:29:50.272
there's partially built machines that are in ruins.

835
00:29:50.286 --> 00:29:51.847
It looks like they've been pulled apart

836
00:29:51.847 --> 00:29:53.712
an big plates of metal have been yanked off.

837
00:29:53.712 --> 00:29:54.839
You get a better look at the giants, too.

838
00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:56.573
They have pieces of metal affixed to them

839
00:29:56.573 --> 00:29:59.634
that are like tied on a rope, haphazard armor.

840
00:29:59.634 --> 00:30:01.774
Yeah, it looks like they're pulling

841
00:30:01.774 --> 00:30:04.970
whatever scraps in the area and are starting to find ways

842
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.866
to better defend themselves.

843
00:30:06.866 --> 00:30:09.594
Then behind it, there's another fence quite a way back

844
00:30:09.594 --> 00:30:11.697
where you can see the actual mining camp begins,

845
00:30:11.697 --> 00:30:13.838
but that's quite a ways this way.

846
00:30:13.838 --> 00:30:15.162
All you can see right now--

847
00:30:15.162 --> 00:30:16.521
Actually, make a perception check for me,

848
00:30:16.521 --> 00:30:19.407
glancing over there.
LIAM: So much fun.

849
00:30:19.407 --> 00:30:20.676
TALIESIN: Hey!

850
00:30:20.676 --> 00:30:21.801
LAURA: Natural 20.

851
00:30:21.801 --> 00:30:23.700
(cheering)

852
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.175
ASHLEY: Awesome!

853
00:30:25.175 --> 00:30:27.476
MATT: These are large creatures,

854
00:30:27.476 --> 00:30:30.150
huge technically, when you consider the size dynamic.

855
00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.366
These are the only three you see in the camp currently.

856
00:30:32.366 --> 00:30:33.927
LAURA: Okay.

857
00:30:33.927 --> 00:30:36.478
SAM: Uh-oh, I don't like the word currently.

858
00:30:36.478 --> 00:30:37.911
LAURA: Currently, is Nott tall enough

859
00:30:37.911 --> 00:30:39.211
to see through the slits?

860
00:30:39.211 --> 00:30:40.962
MATT: Nott could probably use a little boost.

861
00:30:40.962 --> 00:30:42.678
LAURA: Okay, then for my bonus action,

862
00:30:42.678 --> 00:30:44.273
I'm going to boost Nott up.

863
00:30:44.273 --> 00:30:46.307
MATT: Okay.

864
00:30:46.307 --> 00:30:47.535
(giggling)

865
00:30:47.535 --> 00:30:49.203
MATT: Your feet are dangling off the ground

866
00:30:49.203 --> 00:30:51.837
as Jester's swole arm grabs you by the scruff of the cloak

867
00:30:51.837 --> 00:30:53.286
and lifts you up to see.

868
00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:55.720
LAURA: No, I've got my arms around her waist.

869
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.086
(laughter)

870
00:30:57.086 --> 00:30:58.923
MATT: Perfect, all right that finishes Jester's go.

871
00:30:58.923 --> 00:31:02.667
Nott and the giants are going simultaneously.

872
00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:05.238
Nott, you have a higher dexterity than they do,

873
00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:06.386
so I'm letting you act first.

874
00:31:06.386 --> 00:31:09.287
SAM: I'm shooting at the important one in back,

875
00:31:09.287 --> 00:31:12.113
I will fire my crossbow bolt.

876
00:31:12.113 --> 00:31:13.528
MATT: Okay, you have advantage.

877
00:31:13.528 --> 00:31:14.612
It does not know you're there.

878
00:31:14.612 --> 00:31:16.253
SAM: Advantage to hit?

879
00:31:16.253 --> 00:31:17.420
MATT: To hit, yes.

880
00:31:18.664 --> 00:31:19.854
SAM: That's cocked.

881
00:31:19.854 --> 00:31:21.437
MARISHA: I didn't know if it was like a Tony Stark

882
00:31:21.437 --> 00:31:22.276
arc reactor sitch--

883
00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:23.617
SAM: Okay.

884
00:31:23.617 --> 00:31:26.042
That's a 26 to hit.

885
00:31:26.042 --> 00:31:28.606
MATT: 26 definitely hits, yeah.

886
00:31:28.606 --> 00:31:30.320
TALIESIN: Fierce.

887
00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.153
SAM: Sneak attack damage.

888
00:31:32.996 --> 00:31:34.383
Okay.

889
00:31:34.383 --> 00:31:36.091
TRAVIS: I like how he picks them all up together.

890
00:31:36.091 --> 00:31:38.092
Like a dealer in Vegas.

891
00:31:38.092 --> 00:31:39.729
SAM: 26 points of damage.

892
00:31:39.729 --> 00:31:42.283
I'll add onto that, Fury of the Small.

893
00:31:42.283 --> 00:31:44.467
That's an extra--are we level nine now?

894
00:31:44.467 --> 00:31:45.784
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Extra nine points.

895
00:31:45.784 --> 00:31:46.992
ALL: (wooing)

896
00:31:46.992 --> 00:31:49.133
SAM: 35 points.

897
00:31:49.133 --> 00:31:50.966
MATT: Concentration check.

898
00:31:51.896 --> 00:31:53.044
No, fail.

899
00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:53.985
TALIESIN: Hey!

900
00:31:53.985 --> 00:31:55.578
SAM: Yay!
LAURA: Yay!

901
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:57.953
TALIESIN: You're back!

902
00:31:57.953 --> 00:32:01.352
MATT: You regain control.
TRAVIS: Yes, back baby.

903
00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:03.297
MATT: As the bolt strikes,

904
00:32:03.297 --> 00:32:06.504
you watch as the giant (sputters)

905
00:32:06.504 --> 00:32:08.723
grabs the chest, looks up in the direction

906
00:32:08.723 --> 00:32:11.578
where it came from, and barely sees

907
00:32:11.578 --> 00:32:13.483
where you both are inside.

908
00:32:13.483 --> 00:32:16.847
However the look is intense, then fear.

909
00:32:16.847 --> 00:32:18.195
You can see the eyes looking

910
00:32:18.195 --> 00:32:19.275
to the other giants, and there's

911
00:32:19.275 --> 00:32:21.513
a sense of desperation kicking in.

912
00:32:21.513 --> 00:32:23.182
SAM: Oh.

913
00:32:23.182 --> 00:32:25.135
MARISHA: Are they afraid of goblins or something?

914
00:32:25.135 --> 00:32:26.559
MATT: That's worrying.

915
00:32:27.959 --> 00:32:29.878
That finishes your turn, Nott?

916
00:32:29.878 --> 00:32:31.598
Are you going to move?
SAM: Bonus action,

917
00:32:31.598 --> 00:32:33.124
let's try her again.
Not as good, 19.

918
00:32:33.124 --> 00:32:34.105
MATT: Still hits.

919
00:32:34.105 --> 00:32:35.707
TRAVIS: Woo!
MATT: They're big.

920
00:32:35.707 --> 00:32:37.123
For giants, they're lithe.

921
00:32:37.123 --> 00:32:38.402
Their bodies are muscular,

922
00:32:38.402 --> 00:32:40.092
but they're thin and elongated.

923
00:32:40.092 --> 00:32:41.412
They're still pretty big, pretty easy to hit.

924
00:32:41.412 --> 00:32:43.557
SAM: Another 11 points of damage.

925
00:32:43.557 --> 00:32:44.836
LAURA: Do they look thin like emaciated,

926
00:32:44.836 --> 00:32:46.262
or do they look like--?

927
00:32:46.262 --> 00:32:48.366
MATT: Compared to what you're used to knowing about giants.

928
00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:50.495
You have fought a hill giant before,

929
00:32:50.495 --> 00:32:52.269
and they were just meaty.

930
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:54.607
These things, they seem to be like slender

931
00:32:54.607 --> 00:32:57.574
and elongated in their features.

932
00:32:57.574 --> 00:33:00.087
SAM: With my movement, can I--

933
00:33:00.087 --> 00:33:02.230
there was a ladder in there, right?

934
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:03.063
MATT: Correct.

935
00:33:03.063 --> 00:33:04.379
SAM: Can I just go down a little bit

936
00:33:04.379 --> 00:33:05.562
and see what's in the bottom floor?

937
00:33:05.562 --> 00:33:06.395
MATT: Sure.

938
00:33:06.395 --> 00:33:07.377
SAM: Then come back up?

939
00:33:07.377 --> 00:33:08.500
MATT: Yeah, so peeking within.

940
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.976
You can see another chamber with a trap door on the inside

941
00:33:10.976 --> 00:33:13.399
that seems to go further down into a third floor inside.

942
00:33:13.399 --> 00:33:14.423
SAM: No one's in there?

943
00:33:14.423 --> 00:33:15.364
MATT: No one's in there.

944
00:33:15.364 --> 00:33:17.032
That's all I needed, and back up to Jester.

945
00:33:17.032 --> 00:33:18.104
MATT: All right, there you go.

946
00:33:18.104 --> 00:33:20.965
There's Jester's placement right there.

947
00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:22.739
SAM: So if they're scared,

948
00:33:22.739 --> 00:33:25.465
they're doing this out of desperation.

949
00:33:25.465 --> 00:33:27.289
MATT: That finishes your turn.

950
00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:30.790
These two giants now, this one's going to walk up.

951
00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.644
MARISHA: Or they're afraid of goblins.

952
00:33:32.644 --> 00:33:35.508
MATT: And this one's going to walk up there,

953
00:33:35.508 --> 00:33:37.997
pushing through, and one of them's going to--

954
00:33:37.997 --> 00:33:40.305
because they do have a reach of 15 feet with their clubs.

955
00:33:40.305 --> 00:33:42.560
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

956
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.083
MATT: First one's going to go against--

957
00:33:45.083 --> 00:33:46.892
they both get two attacks.

958
00:33:46.892 --> 00:33:48.854
One against Beau and one against Yasha.

959
00:33:48.854 --> 00:33:52.245
The first one against Beau has disadvantage.

960
00:33:52.245 --> 00:33:55.472
Which is great, because the first roll is a natural 20.

961
00:33:55.472 --> 00:33:58.178
Second one is an 18 to hit.

962
00:33:58.178 --> 00:33:59.181
MARISHA: Miss.
MATT: Misses.

963
00:33:59.181 --> 00:34:00.854
SAM: What?
ASHLEY: Ooh.

964
00:34:00.854 --> 00:34:03.397
MARISHA: I jump and switch feet.

965
00:34:03.397 --> 00:34:05.743
MATT: Yes, and as you leap in the air.

966
00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:07.338
Where, I'm considering

967
00:34:07.338 --> 00:34:08.626
one strike, the two attacks are one strike

968
00:34:08.626 --> 00:34:10.809
as it takes one giant baseball bat swing against you.

969
00:34:10.809 --> 00:34:12.868
You jump out of the way and the full might

970
00:34:12.868 --> 00:34:14.310
goes toward Yasha.

971
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.544
Yasha, that is going to be 21 to hit.

972
00:34:16.544 --> 00:34:18.281
ASHLEY: Uh huh.

973
00:34:18.281 --> 00:34:20.103
TRAVIS: This is like one of those obstacle course videos.

974
00:34:20.103 --> 00:34:21.533
First kid gets out of the way,

975
00:34:21.533 --> 00:34:22.938
second one's like, "Hi mom!"

976
00:34:22.938 --> 00:34:23.805
(impact)

977
00:34:23.805 --> 00:34:25.331
MATT: Exactly.
(laughter)

978
00:34:25.331 --> 00:34:26.831
LAURA: Wipe out.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

979
00:34:27.947 --> 00:34:30.471
ASHLEY: When it gets hit in their stomach,

980
00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:32.155
and then they cartwheel into the water.

981
00:34:32.155 --> 00:34:33.474
TRAVIS: They make that great noise.

982
00:34:33.474 --> 00:34:34.435
(honks)
MATT: 26 points

983
00:34:34.435 --> 00:34:35.667
of bludgeoning damage.

984
00:34:35.667 --> 00:34:37.201
MATT: Reduced to 13,

985
00:34:37.201 --> 00:34:38.733
because you are raging.
ASHLEY: Yes, okay.

986
00:34:38.733 --> 00:34:40.571
MATT: It cracks you on the side,

987
00:34:40.571 --> 00:34:43.042
but you hold fast and shrug it off

988
00:34:43.042 --> 00:34:44.501
as it withdraws the club.

989
00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:46.032
You see it angrily looking,

990
00:34:46.032 --> 00:34:48.344
it's now facing you, you can see the eyes themselves

991
00:34:48.344 --> 00:34:50.452
kind of white with pupils in there,

992
00:34:50.452 --> 00:34:53.047
a very intense and heavy breathing.

993
00:34:53.047 --> 00:34:54.482
It is bearing down.

994
00:34:54.482 --> 00:34:56.162
The other one is taking two swings at you

995
00:34:56.162 --> 00:34:57.844
because you're the one that--

996
00:34:57.844 --> 00:34:59.840
Wait, no, it can't take that because it's charmed.

997
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.791
It looks at you and gives a nod.

998
00:35:02.791 --> 00:35:03.886
TRAVIS: High five, bro.

999
00:35:03.886 --> 00:35:05.613
MATT: High fives you and pushes you off the side.

1000
00:35:05.613 --> 00:35:08.235
TRAVIS: No!
(laughter)

1001
00:35:08.235 --> 00:35:10.049
MATT: Instead he's going to move in,

1002
00:35:10.049 --> 00:35:12.961
step over the side, and it goes twice for Yasha

1003
00:35:12.961 --> 00:35:14.770
because it's not going to attack you

1004
00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:16.279
because you charmed it.

1005
00:35:16.279 --> 00:35:17.698
First attack, well that's actually,

1006
00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:18.956
that's a 12.

1007
00:35:18.956 --> 00:35:20.506
ASHLEY: Okay, that doesn't hit.

1008
00:35:20.506 --> 00:35:21.997
That doesn't hit.
MATT: Does not hit.

1009
00:35:22.839 --> 00:35:24.428
Yeah it was a three plus nine.

1010
00:35:24.428 --> 00:35:26.864
Other attack against you, that is a 22 though.

1011
00:35:26.864 --> 00:35:28.072
ASHLEY: That hits.

1012
00:35:28.072 --> 00:35:29.638
MATT: All right, so the next strike,

1013
00:35:31.664 --> 00:35:33.393
20 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to ten.

1014
00:35:33.393 --> 00:35:34.943
ASHLEY: Okay.

1015
00:35:34.943 --> 00:35:38.101
MATT: So it slams down, the wood splinters.

1016
00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:39.609
As you dodge out of the way

1017
00:35:39.609 --> 00:35:42.038
of the first one, it breaks up part of the flooring,

1018
00:35:42.038 --> 00:35:43.481
and you're having to back up

1019
00:35:43.481 --> 00:35:44.941
and find a way to keep yourself standing

1020
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:45.999
with all that splintered wood

1021
00:35:45.999 --> 00:35:47.178
jagged up in your direction.

1022
00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:48.395
As you look up, the second one boom,

1023
00:35:48.395 --> 00:35:49.228
hits you in the shoulder

1024
00:35:49.228 --> 00:35:51.764
and you shoulder the majority of the damage

1025
00:35:51.764 --> 00:35:54.592
and you feel it crack in the back of your shoulder blade,

1026
00:35:54.592 --> 00:35:56.655
but you lift up with the sword

1027
00:35:56.655 --> 00:35:58.286
and (grunts) push it off.

1028
00:35:58.286 --> 00:35:59.728
That ends both of those giants' turn.

1029
00:35:59.728 --> 00:36:00.865
Top of the round, Beau, you're up.

1030
00:36:00.865 --> 00:36:04.282
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to do a sick leap down,

1031
00:36:05.835 --> 00:36:09.041
gonna come over here. If I'm on this wagon wheel,

1032
00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:11.890
am I within range?

1033
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.300
MATT: Yes, you are within melee range.

1034
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.133
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: Is she spinning around?

1035
00:36:14.133 --> 00:36:15.349
MATT: The wheel is like, (squeaks)

1036
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:18.331
it is shifting slightly.
MARISHA: I kick off

1037
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:20.920
and I use that momentum to do a

1038
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.099
my cool spinning roundhouse with the wheel.

1039
00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:25.460
Like those spinning stripper poles, you know?

1040
00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.240
(laughter)

1041
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.248
TRAVIS: "You know?"
MARISHA: Yeah.

1042
00:36:29.248 --> 00:36:31.972
MATT: You straight up Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku'ed these guys.

1043
00:36:31.972 --> 00:36:33.337
All right, that's awesome.

1044
00:36:33.337 --> 00:36:34.803
MARISHA: Yeah, whatever you just said.

1045
00:36:34.803 --> 00:36:36.205
MATT: Street Fighter, it's Hurricane Kick.

1046
00:36:36.205 --> 00:36:38.043
I'm a Street Fighter nerd, you know this.

1047
00:36:39.618 --> 00:36:42.130
MARISHA: I'll take that. 16,

1048
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.577
plus three, plus six, 25.

1049
00:36:45.577 --> 00:36:47.679
MATT: That definitely hits.

1050
00:36:47.679 --> 00:36:49.669
These guys are undamaged currently.

1051
00:36:49.669 --> 00:36:52.495
MARISHA: Oh wait, I said I used my foot.

1052
00:36:52.495 --> 00:36:53.328
Ew, gross.

1053
00:36:53.328 --> 00:36:55.589
LIAM: Such a great visual.

1054
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:56.973
MARISHA: Oh wait, no, I always do that.

1055
00:36:56.973 --> 00:36:58.365
I accidentally add my--

1056
00:36:58.365 --> 00:36:59.922
that would have actually been 30 to hit.

1057
00:36:59.922 --> 00:37:02.711
Still, it hurts even more.

1058
00:37:02.711 --> 00:37:04.598
MARISHA: Seven. Seven damage.
MATT: Seven points of damage.

1059
00:37:04.598 --> 00:37:05.723
You got it.

1060
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.508
MARISHA:Stunning strike.
MATT: Oh, gotcha.

1061
00:37:10.508 --> 00:37:12.287
LAURA: Oh, gotcha.
MATT: That is going to be 19.

1062
00:37:12.287 --> 00:37:14.302
14 plus five.

1063
00:37:14.302 --> 00:37:16.342
MARISHA: Fuck!
MATT: So it resists the stun.

1064
00:37:16.342 --> 00:37:17.317
MARISHA: Dammit!

1065
00:37:18.203 --> 00:37:22.566
Again again, this time I'm going to take my staff,

1066
00:37:22.566 --> 00:37:25.470
and while I'm still--while the wheel is slowing,

1067
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:26.642
I lose a little momentum,

1068
00:37:26.642 --> 00:37:28.126
and I jut turn a little bit,

1069
00:37:28.126 --> 00:37:29.401
and then with the staff.

1070
00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:30.619
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

1071
00:37:30.619 --> 00:37:32.468
Add your d4.
MARISHA: Oh right.

1072
00:37:32.468 --> 00:37:35.330
MARISHA: That's 22 plus four.
MATT: That hits.

1073
00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.569
Go ahead and roll damage on the second one.

1074
00:37:37.569 --> 00:37:38.929
MARISHA: Big stick.

1075
00:37:38.929 --> 00:37:40.895
MATT: And Fjord and Yasha,
you guys are on deck.

1076
00:37:40.895 --> 00:37:42.386
MARISHA: Goddamn it, fuck. Eight damage.

1077
00:37:42.386 --> 00:37:44.034
MATT: Eight points of damage.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

1078
00:37:44.034 --> 00:37:46.167
MATT: All righty.
SAM: You can do that again?

1079
00:37:46.167 --> 00:37:47.334
MATT: Natural one.

1080
00:37:48.247 --> 00:37:50.705
MARISHA: Stunned!
MATT: It is stunned.

1081
00:37:50.705 --> 00:37:52.165
MARISHA: I can do it as many times as I want

1082
00:37:52.165 --> 00:37:52.998
as long as I hit.

1083
00:37:52.998 --> 00:37:54.339
MATT: It just costs a ki point

1084
00:37:54.339 --> 00:37:55.755
every time she does it.

1085
00:37:55.755 --> 00:37:57.313
LIAM: Until she's out of quarters.

1086
00:37:57.313 --> 00:37:58.890
MATT: Essentially.

1087
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.478
That one, as you turn with the staff,

1088
00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.880
you go right for the throat and you hit

1089
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.511
where its Adam's apple is and (clicks tongue)

1090
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:06.500
(wheezes) and it drops the club for a second,

1091
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.959
it grabs its throat, and it's like (coughing).

1092
00:38:08.959 --> 00:38:11.792
So it's stunned.
LIAM: Ooh, I feel it.

1093
00:38:13.096 --> 00:38:15.203
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows, pop pop.

1094
00:38:15.203 --> 00:38:16.036
MATT: The same one?

1095
00:38:16.036 --> 00:38:16.920
MARISHA: Yep.
MATT: All right.

1096
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.769
Advantage on both attacks because it's stunned. Go for it.

1097
00:38:22.027 --> 00:38:22.860
With your d4.

1098
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.763
MARISHA: That is the same as before.

1099
00:38:25.763 --> 00:38:27.676
26 with one.
MATT: Hits.

1100
00:38:27.676 --> 00:38:32.070
MARISHA: Then the other is 17 plus three, so 20.

1101
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.676
MATT: Did you roll advantage for each?

1102
00:38:33.676 --> 00:38:35.028
MARISHA: No, I rolled for both of them.

1103
00:38:35.028 --> 00:38:36.480
MATT: All right, both attacks have advantage.

1104
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.959
MARISHA: Oh.
MATT: Because you stunned it.

1105
00:38:37.959 --> 00:38:38.792
MARISHA: Oh!

1106
00:38:41.983 --> 00:38:44.623
That's better, so one would be like 26--

1107
00:38:44.623 --> 00:38:46.433
MATT: Just saying, it's an additional chance for a crit--

1108
00:38:46.433 --> 00:38:47.766
MARISHA: For a crit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:38:47.766 --> 00:38:48.849
I hit!
MATT: Yeah, all right.

1110
00:38:48.849 --> 00:38:50.624
Damage on both your rolls. Go for it.

1111
00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:55.830
MARISHA: All right, that's something.

1112
00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:00.389
So 12 plus three, 15, plus another four, 19.

1113
00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.573
Extract Aspects.

1114
00:39:03.573 --> 00:39:04.564
MATT: All righty.

1115
00:39:05.489 --> 00:39:07.247
You learn they are--

1116
00:39:07.247 --> 00:39:10.439
so they have no condition immunities,

1117
00:39:10.439 --> 00:39:12.460
they have no resistances, they have no vulnerabilities.

1118
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.623
So it's good to (hiccups) pardon,

1119
00:39:13.623 --> 00:39:14.774
good to know.
MARISHA: No resistances.

1120
00:39:14.774 --> 00:39:16.036
LAURA: They've got no vulnerabilities, either?

1121
00:39:16.036 --> 00:39:17.614
MATT: No vulnerabilities, no resistances,

1122
00:39:17.614 --> 00:39:19.170
and are not immune to any condition effects, either,

1123
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.003
which is good.

1124
00:39:20.003 --> 00:39:21.203
MARISHA: They are <i>not</i> immune?

1125
00:39:21.203 --> 00:39:23.221
SAM: They can be stunned, paralyzed, poisoned--

1126
00:39:23.221 --> 00:39:24.393
MARISHA: Poisoned, okay.
MATT: Correct.

1127
00:39:24.393 --> 00:39:27.393
LAURA: You basic.
MARISHA: You basic.

1128
00:39:29.943 --> 00:39:32.552
MARISHA: No resistance, no immunities, no vulnerabilities.

1129
00:39:32.552 --> 00:39:33.897
MATT: Correct.

1130
00:39:33.897 --> 00:39:34.730
MARISHA: Basic.

1131
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.063
LAURA: Fucking boots.

1132
00:39:36.063 --> 00:39:39.395
(laughter)

1133
00:39:39.395 --> 00:39:40.228
MARISHA: That's my turn.
MATT: All right,

1134
00:39:40.228 --> 00:39:41.853
that finishes your go.

1135
00:39:41.853 --> 00:39:43.478
Yasha, Fjord, what are you guys doing?

1136
00:39:43.478 --> 00:39:45.515
TRAVIS: I look at the giants and I say:

1137
00:39:45.515 --> 00:39:49.089
My wise and handsome friends.

1138
00:39:49.089 --> 00:39:52.573
These fine folks are our allies and here to help.

1139
00:39:52.573 --> 00:39:56.410
When you are able, please make your way

1140
00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.790
to the right side of this here camp

1141
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:03.790
and take a load off, take a seat, and the danger will pass.

1142
00:40:04.955 --> 00:40:06.288
SAM: Uh-huh.
MATT: Okay.

1143
00:40:06.288 --> 00:40:07.998
SAM: Thank you, Preacher Man.

1144
00:40:07.998 --> 00:40:11.581
MATT: Both of them look up at you and,

1145
00:40:11.581 --> 00:40:14.787
one of them's going (coughing).

1146
00:40:14.787 --> 00:40:16.250
TRAVIS: I mean they'll attack if provoked,

1147
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.079
but they're our friends.

1148
00:40:19.079 --> 00:40:21.525
MATT: They--
LIAM: What can I tell ya?

1149
00:40:21.525 --> 00:40:25.052
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

1150
00:40:25.052 --> 00:40:28.035
TRAVIS: Disadvantage, New York City?

1151
00:40:29.932 --> 00:40:32.873
MARISHA: Is it because I just punched him in the face a lot?

1152
00:40:32.873 --> 00:40:33.886
TRAVIS: Nine.
LAURA: He doesn't speak Giant.

1153
00:40:33.886 --> 00:40:35.423
MATT: Nine.

1154
00:40:35.423 --> 00:40:37.737
They're not backing away, but they are confused.

1155
00:40:37.737 --> 00:40:39.919
They do not seem to understand the words you are saying.

1156
00:40:39.919 --> 00:40:41.265
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: Oh no.

1157
00:40:41.265 --> 00:40:43.932
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! Right.

1158
00:40:45.366 --> 00:40:47.502
MATT: They are certainly avoiding you.

1159
00:40:47.502 --> 00:40:49.187
TRAVIS: Mm hm, mm hm, mm hm.

1160
00:40:49.187 --> 00:40:51.957
I will use my movement

1161
00:40:51.957 --> 00:40:55.718
to come to the edge of this roof,

1162
00:40:55.718 --> 00:40:58.242
and I will hop down in between them.

1163
00:40:58.242 --> 00:40:59.924
MATT: Like down this way?

1164
00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:01.424
TRAVIS: Yeah, down to where Beau is,

1165
00:41:01.424 --> 00:41:03.976
so I'm right next to Beau if there's any purchase.

1166
00:41:03.976 --> 00:41:04.809
MATT: Right there?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1167
00:41:04.809 --> 00:41:08.918
MATT: All right, cool. We'll put you down right there.

1168
00:41:08.918 --> 00:41:10.675
LAURA: That's really cool.
TALIESIN: So cool.

1169
00:41:10.675 --> 00:41:14.303
MATT: You leap down, ankles (cracking) a little bit,

1170
00:41:14.303 --> 00:41:15.594
but you're like, "I'm fine."

1171
00:41:15.594 --> 00:41:17.272
You look up and now the shadow

1172
00:41:17.272 --> 00:41:19.952
of the looming giants is staring down at you.

1173
00:41:19.952 --> 00:41:22.287
TRAVIS: All they heard is, Blah blah blah blah blah.

1174
00:41:22.287 --> 00:41:24.536
MATT: (muffled trombone sounds)

1175
00:41:24.536 --> 00:41:25.877
TRAVIS: Cool, that's my turn.

1176
00:41:25.877 --> 00:41:26.852
MATT: You have their attention.

1177
00:41:26.852 --> 00:41:27.685
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1178
00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.029
MATT: But they don't understand what you're saying.

1179
00:41:29.029 --> 00:41:29.862
TRAVIS: Right.

1180
00:41:29.862 --> 00:41:30.695
TRAVIS: Because that's my action

1181
00:41:30.695 --> 00:41:31.556
to say all that, right?

1182
00:41:31.556 --> 00:41:33.726
MATT: I would say--
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1183
00:41:33.726 --> 00:41:35.381
MATT: If you can include it as, it's short enough,

1184
00:41:35.381 --> 00:41:36.616
or you can include it with an action if you had one.

1185
00:41:36.616 --> 00:41:37.624
TRAVIS: It was not short.

1186
00:41:37.624 --> 00:41:38.638
MATT: It was pretty lengthy.

1187
00:41:38.638 --> 00:41:39.659
Yeah, we'll go ahead.

1188
00:41:39.659 --> 00:41:40.811
That ends your go.

1189
00:41:40.811 --> 00:41:42.081
Yasha?
ASHLEY: Okay.

1190
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:46.740
I'm going to try and take a stabby

1191
00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.758
at the one closest to me.

1192
00:41:48.758 --> 00:41:50.439
I can't see over the towers, so.

1193
00:41:50.439 --> 00:41:52.682
Can I reach?
MATT: You cannot reach.

1194
00:41:52.682 --> 00:41:54.024
You'd have to move to get to them.

1195
00:41:54.024 --> 00:41:55.163
ASHLEY: Okay, you know what I'm going to do?

1196
00:41:55.163 --> 00:41:57.240
MATT: You can move next to where Beau is on the other wheel.

1197
00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.723
ASHLEY: Sure, yeah. I'll do that.

1198
00:42:00.723 --> 00:42:04.598
MATT: You are both slowly spinning on these wheels.

1199
00:42:04.598 --> 00:42:07.458
LAURA: Yeah, that's awesome.
MATT: Just like (squeaks).

1200
00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:10.400
(laughter)

1201
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.773
ASHLEY: It's like in Thor Ragnarok,

1202
00:42:11.773 --> 00:42:12.606
Hold on, hold on.

1203
00:42:12.606 --> 00:42:13.439
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

1204
00:42:13.439 --> 00:42:15.293
(laughter)

1205
00:42:15.293 --> 00:42:17.134
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to attack

1206
00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:18.037
with my Magician's Judge.

1207
00:42:18.037 --> 00:42:19.629
MATT: All right, you have advantage on these strikes

1208
00:42:19.629 --> 00:42:21.040
because it is currently stunned.

1209
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.040
TALIESIN: You get a d4 added to them, as well.

1210
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.776
MATT: Correct.
ASHLEY: Okay, so it would be--

1211
00:42:24.776 --> 00:42:26.683
MATT: Because you're hashtag blessed.

1212
00:42:26.683 --> 00:42:29.816
ASHLEY: Okay, so I take the 15.

1213
00:42:29.816 --> 00:42:30.874
TALIESIN: And then, yeah.

1214
00:42:31.899 --> 00:42:32.732
ASHLEY: Plus?

1215
00:42:32.732 --> 00:42:35.082
TALIESIN: Plus, also plus the d4.

1216
00:42:35.082 --> 00:42:36.096
MATT: Caduceus you're on deck, by the way.

1217
00:42:36.096 --> 00:42:37.886
TALIESIN: Yeah, I, yeah.

1218
00:42:37.886 --> 00:42:38.719
Hm.

1219
00:42:43.354 --> 00:42:44.901
ASHLEY: 25.
MATT: That hits.

1220
00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:49.186
ASHLEY: Okay, so, oh boy.

1221
00:42:49.186 --> 00:42:50.465
Where's my all my things?

1222
00:42:50.465 --> 00:42:52.473
Okay, so plus Divine Fury?

1223
00:42:52.473 --> 00:42:54.306
MATT: Correct, you get 3d6.

1224
00:42:59.515 --> 00:43:00.348
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

1225
00:43:01.321 --> 00:43:02.680
Five, six, seven, eight.

1226
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.567
TRAVIS: I should have told them to listen to you.

1227
00:43:04.567 --> 00:43:06.183
TALIESIN: You don't know I speak Giant.

1228
00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:09.007
Well, I did make a comment, but you're not listening.

1229
00:43:09.007 --> 00:43:10.606
TRAVIS: Oh, you had to talk, right?

1230
00:43:10.606 --> 00:43:11.935
TALIESIN: Well, they said something

1231
00:43:11.935 --> 00:43:13.798
and I commented on what they were doing,

1232
00:43:13.798 --> 00:43:17.000
but that's as far as--
ASHLEY: 16 points of damage.

1233
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.890
MATT: 16 points of damage, nice!

1234
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:20.643
All right, so as you land on the wheel,

1235
00:43:20.643 --> 00:43:23.104
you swing, carving right through part of its shoulder

1236
00:43:23.104 --> 00:43:25.624
and it (groaning) it bends with the damage

1237
00:43:25.624 --> 00:43:27.736
and you (squeaking), oh shit,

1238
00:43:27.736 --> 00:43:29.125
you go for a second strike as you spin around,

1239
00:43:29.125 --> 00:43:30.445
if you're ready to do the next attack.

1240
00:43:30.445 --> 00:43:31.278
ASHLEY: Yep.

1241
00:43:34.436 --> 00:43:36.176
MATT: Roll to see if you do hit first.

1242
00:43:36.176 --> 00:43:38.027
ASHLEY: Say again? Oh, sorry, sorry.

1243
00:43:38.027 --> 00:43:39.883
MATT: You'll probably hit, because you have advantage.

1244
00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:42.100
ASHLEY: Oh, that's cocked.

1245
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.544
Okay, well natural 20.

1246
00:43:43.544 --> 00:43:44.929
MATT: Oh, well okay, you have Brutal Critical,

1247
00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:46.621
so you get to roll an additional die

1248
00:43:46.621 --> 00:43:49.369
because you're level nine.
LAURA: Yes!

1249
00:43:49.369 --> 00:43:50.369
LIAM: Barbarian.

1250
00:43:51.665 --> 00:43:52.671
ASHLEY: Oh, I hate these.

1251
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:53.890
Okay, hold on.

1252
00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:55.613
Wait, I have, I have.

1253
00:43:55.613 --> 00:43:57.282
Once per turn, when you roll damage

1254
00:43:57.282 --> 00:43:58.415
from a melee weapon attack,

1255
00:43:58.415 --> 00:43:59.760
you can reroll the weapon's damage dice

1256
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.601
and use either total.

1257
00:44:00.601 --> 00:44:01.620
Okay, I'm using Savage Attack,

1258
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.719
so I'm going to re-roll these.

1259
00:44:02.719 --> 00:44:03.552
MATT: You got it.

1260
00:44:03.552 --> 00:44:04.452
ASHLEY: I can use the other two.

1261
00:44:04.452 --> 00:44:05.581
I brought some of these other dice.

1262
00:44:05.581 --> 00:44:07.036
TRAVIS: Nice job.

1263
00:44:07.036 --> 00:44:08.984
MATT: That's right, you took that feat.

1264
00:44:08.984 --> 00:44:10.144
ASHLEY: Yep, yep, yep.

1265
00:44:10.144 --> 00:44:10.977
MATT: Nice.

1266
00:44:10.977 --> 00:44:12.214
ASHLEY: See if things roll better.

1267
00:44:12.214 --> 00:44:13.773
Getting back in it.

1268
00:44:16.203 --> 00:44:17.353
LIAM: Never going to give you up.

1269
00:44:17.353 --> 00:44:18.186
TALIESIN: Ooh!
ASHLEY: That's better.

1270
00:44:18.186 --> 00:44:19.456
TALIESIN: That's way better.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1271
00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:20.463
TALIESIN: So it's 3d6.
ASHLEY: 12.

1272
00:44:21.688 --> 00:44:23.325
MATT: Next the Brutal Critical.

1273
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.242
Well, you double two of the dice,

1274
00:44:26.242 --> 00:44:27.896
and then you add the additional third.

1275
00:44:27.896 --> 00:44:29.048
Because it's a critical hit.

1276
00:44:29.048 --> 00:44:30.106
ASHLEY: Oh, so.

1277
00:44:32.066 --> 00:44:33.502
I rolled a 12 total--wait,

1278
00:44:33.502 --> 00:44:34.992
double two of the dice?

1279
00:44:34.992 --> 00:44:36.508
MATT: Yes, because the third is what

1280
00:44:36.508 --> 00:44:37.341
you add onto it at the end.

1281
00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:38.515
ASHLEY: Okay, so I should roll it again.

1282
00:44:38.515 --> 00:44:39.348
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1283
00:44:39.348 --> 00:44:40.522
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
TALIESIN: There you go.

1284
00:44:40.522 --> 00:44:41.526
ASHLEY: Fine.

1285
00:44:41.526 --> 00:44:44.038
Nine, so 18.

1286
00:44:44.038 --> 00:44:47.516
Plus four, so that's--?

1287
00:44:47.516 --> 00:44:48.891
MATT: 22.
ASHLEY: Yes.

1288
00:44:48.891 --> 00:44:50.448
MATT: Woo, 38 points of damage in one round.

1289
00:44:50.448 --> 00:44:51.372
Nice.
TRAVIS: Woo!

1290
00:44:51.372 --> 00:44:53.109
MATT: Momentum from that wheel was enough,

1291
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:54.899
so you swing wide the second time.

1292
00:44:54.899 --> 00:44:56.365
The blade actually stops because it cuts

1293
00:44:56.365 --> 00:44:58.204
into the side of its chest.

1294
00:44:58.204 --> 00:44:59.907
And (grunts) lunges in a bit,

1295
00:44:59.907 --> 00:45:01.645
and you can see the side of its tunic

1296
00:45:01.645 --> 00:45:03.487
made of like patched together leather

1297
00:45:03.487 --> 00:45:06.345
starting to grow thick with its own blood.

1298
00:45:06.345 --> 00:45:08.261
It's like, (gurgling) you can see it's starting

1299
00:45:08.261 --> 00:45:09.827
to regain itself a little bit

1300
00:45:09.827 --> 00:45:11.300
and its eyes flicker back towards you,

1301
00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.550
anger and fury in its face.

1302
00:45:14.775 --> 00:45:16.486
That finishes your turn?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1303
00:45:16.486 --> 00:45:17.799
MATT: All right, Caduceus, you're up.

1304
00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:19.349
ASHLEY: (sighs)

1305
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:20.266
TALIESIN: Hm, okay.

1306
00:45:22.572 --> 00:45:27.500
Let's see, I'm going to see if I can back up a little bit

1307
00:45:28.825 --> 00:45:31.141
and see the head of this one that's a little out of it,

1308
00:45:31.141 --> 00:45:33.694
if I step back a little bit.

1309
00:45:33.694 --> 00:45:35.765
Can I see the one that everyone seems

1310
00:45:35.765 --> 00:45:37.213
to be beating off of?

1311
00:45:37.213 --> 00:45:38.428
MATT: If you step back a little bit?

1312
00:45:38.428 --> 00:45:39.261
Yes.

1313
00:45:39.261 --> 00:45:41.614
You can see the top of both of their heads right now.

1314
00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:46.555
TALIESIN: I'm going to call out, if I can,

1315
00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:53.497
if you surrender we can settle this amicably, in Giant.

1316
00:45:53.497 --> 00:45:54.865
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to

1317
00:45:54.865 --> 00:45:56.183
hit it with a quick Sacred Flame.

1318
00:45:56.183 --> 00:45:58.402
MARISHA: Amicably.

1319
00:45:58.402 --> 00:46:00.876
TALIESIN: I'm going to pop a Sacred Flame at the giant.

1320
00:46:00.876 --> 00:46:01.720
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Is that okay?

1321
00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.553
MATT: Which one?

1322
00:46:02.553 --> 00:46:03.489
The one on the left or the one on the right?

1323
00:46:03.489 --> 00:46:04.397
TALIESIN: The one that everyone's beating on.

1324
00:46:04.397 --> 00:46:06.119
MATT: Okay, then go for it.

1325
00:46:06.119 --> 00:46:07.171
TALIESIN: It's a dex save.

1326
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:10.440
MATT: Dex save. It's stunned so it automatically fails it?

1327
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.406
Yes.
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

1328
00:46:11.406 --> 00:46:13.482
MATT: So just roll damage.
TALIESIN: That's nice.

1329
00:46:13.482 --> 00:46:16.845
I mean I say that, this feels mean, but here we are.

1330
00:46:17.795 --> 00:46:19.237
That's 14.

1331
00:46:19.237 --> 00:46:23.729
That's 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 points of damage.

1332
00:46:23.729 --> 00:46:25.568
MATT: 19 points of damage from a Sacred Flame, nice.

1333
00:46:25.568 --> 00:46:27.788
TALIESIN: I've got that thing where I get the plus five.

1334
00:46:27.788 --> 00:46:29.905
It's crazy, crazy town banana pants.

1335
00:46:29.905 --> 00:46:33.480
Then I'm going to use the rest of my movement

1336
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.375
to--let's see I've got five, ten, 15--

1337
00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:38.518
MATT: Make persuasion check with disadvantage.

1338
00:46:38.518 --> 00:46:39.351
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair.

1339
00:46:39.351 --> 00:46:40.184
MATT: Because you did attack it

1340
00:46:40.184 --> 00:46:41.765
while you were shouting this.
TALIESIN: I did, I did.

1341
00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:42.743
That's fair.

1342
00:46:42.743 --> 00:46:45.667
Persuasion with disadvantage.

1343
00:46:45.667 --> 00:46:47.690
Well, that ain't bad, 16.

1344
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.287
MATT: 16, okay.

1345
00:46:49.287 --> 00:46:53.938
TALIESIN: I, you know, my attempt at reasonable surrender.

1346
00:46:53.938 --> 00:46:56.330
Then I'm going to...

1347
00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:02.995
I'm going to move about where--yeah.

1348
00:47:04.333 --> 00:47:05.684
Five, ten, 15.

1349
00:47:05.684 --> 00:47:08.849
I'm going to move right over there by that little stone pile

1350
00:47:08.849 --> 00:47:11.658
against the wood.
MATT: Here?

1351
00:47:11.658 --> 00:47:12.657
TALIESIN: Yeah, like right there.

1352
00:47:12.657 --> 00:47:13.490
MATT: Okay.

1353
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:14.323
TALIESIN: That's where I'm going to

1354
00:47:14.323 --> 00:47:16.025
try and hide from the next thing that happens.

1355
00:47:16.025 --> 00:47:18.042
MATT: Okay, you've got it.

1356
00:47:18.042 --> 00:47:19.159
That finishes you up, Caduceus?

1357
00:47:19.159 --> 00:47:20.254
TALIESIN: Yep.
MATT: All right.

1358
00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:22.459
It is now this giant's turn.

1359
00:47:22.459 --> 00:47:26.129
Watching one of its companions being bludgeoned and cut,

1360
00:47:26.129 --> 00:47:27.714
hearing you shout across the way,

1361
00:47:27.714 --> 00:47:32.060
it's eye are going wild and it shouts out in retort to you,

1362
00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.781
what the rest of you hear is more giant

1363
00:47:33.781 --> 00:47:35.022
guttural noises being shouted.

1364
00:47:35.022 --> 00:47:36.498
You hear a translation that says,

1365
00:47:36.498 --> 00:47:38.758
No, you attack us!

1366
00:47:38.758 --> 00:47:40.787
We're defending.

1367
00:47:40.787 --> 00:47:42.454
Come in and you die.

1368
00:47:43.817 --> 00:47:44.650
MARISHA: All right.

1369
00:47:46.102 --> 00:47:46.935
TALIESIN: He ain't wrong.

1370
00:47:46.935 --> 00:47:47.768
MATT: Make an insight check.

1371
00:47:47.768 --> 00:47:49.101
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.

1372
00:47:52.147 --> 00:47:54.614
Wow, that's a 27.

1373
00:47:56.246 --> 00:47:57.537
LAURA: Maybe they're just nice.

1374
00:47:57.537 --> 00:47:59.101
LIAM: What Caduceus is for.

1375
00:47:59.101 --> 00:47:59.934
TRAVIS: Whisper!

1376
00:47:59.934 --> 00:48:01.677
First whisper of the night.

1377
00:48:01.677 --> 00:48:03.918
SAM: This whisper brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

1378
00:48:03.918 --> 00:48:05.180
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, also.

1379
00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.128
LAURA: Maybe.

1380
00:48:06.128 --> 00:48:07.842
MARISHA: They look hungry.

1381
00:48:07.842 --> 00:48:09.997
LIAM: I feel like with Caduceus' wisdom,

1382
00:48:09.997 --> 00:48:12.027
we should have a pair of soup cans

1383
00:48:12.027 --> 00:48:13.843
that go from Matt to Taliesin.

1384
00:48:13.843 --> 00:48:16.787
SAM: Dwarven Forge has a 406 page PDF--

1385
00:48:16.787 --> 00:48:18.761
TALIESIN: I can't respond until my turn?

1386
00:48:18.761 --> 00:48:20.742
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair.

1387
00:48:20.742 --> 00:48:22.876
MATT: As it says that, it take its staff

1388
00:48:22.876 --> 00:48:24.444
and slams it into the ground.

1389
00:48:24.444 --> 00:48:27.995
There's a rumble and, from over there,

1390
00:48:27.995 --> 00:48:30.921
suddenly the ground around this portion of the wall

1391
00:48:30.921 --> 00:48:34.637
and the gate explodes.

1392
00:48:34.637 --> 00:48:36.778
Sharp shards of earth and rock,

1393
00:48:36.778 --> 00:48:39.475
go punching out of it

1394
00:48:39.475 --> 00:48:41.605
from all different directions.

1395
00:48:41.605 --> 00:48:43.253
Yasha, Beau, Fjord,

1396
00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:46.635
I need you guys, actually, it's a 20 foot cube?

1397
00:48:46.635 --> 00:48:48.033
MARISHA: Are we still Blessed?

1398
00:48:48.033 --> 00:48:49.411
MATT: That would be--you're still Blessed.

1399
00:48:49.411 --> 00:48:50.822
That would be Caduceus, as well.

1400
00:48:50.822 --> 00:48:52.784
I need you guys to all make dexterity saving throws, please.

1401
00:48:52.784 --> 00:48:54.518
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: You have a d4

1402
00:48:54.518 --> 00:48:55.999
to add to that save.
MATT: You do.

1403
00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:57.903
LIAM: Is the door surviving this?

1404
00:48:57.903 --> 00:48:59.745
MATT: The door is.
TRAVIS: This sucks.

1405
00:48:59.745 --> 00:49:02.636
MARISHA: Oh ho, ho, ho yes.

1406
00:49:02.636 --> 00:49:04.085
Honey!

1407
00:49:04.085 --> 00:49:06.036
TALIESIN: Oh, all right, all right.

1408
00:49:06.036 --> 00:49:09.278
MATT: This here is torn asunder.

1409
00:49:09.278 --> 00:49:10.780
TRAVIS: Oh, really?
MATT: This part of the wall

1410
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.806
is blown apart.

1411
00:49:12.806 --> 00:49:15.490
It is rubble and ruin on that side there.

1412
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:17.748
[JENGA] We were traveling.

1413
00:49:17.748 --> 00:49:19.481
MATT: What'd you get?
MARISHA: 30.

1414
00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:21.132
MATT: Oh, shit!
ASHLEY: Damn.

1415
00:49:21.132 --> 00:49:22.454
TRAVIS: What?
MATT: Shit!

1416
00:49:22.454 --> 00:49:24.498
MARISHA: I rolled a 19, plus eight,

1417
00:49:24.498 --> 00:49:26.870
plus that d4.
MATT: That'll do it, yeah.

1418
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:28.799
All right.
ASHLEY: 21.

1419
00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.024
MATT: Nice.
TALIESIN: 13.

1420
00:49:30.024 --> 00:49:31.702
MATT: 13, fail.
TRAVIS: 16.

1421
00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.079
MATT: 16, all right.

1422
00:49:33.079 --> 00:49:34.406
Everyone but Caduceus succeeded.

1423
00:49:34.406 --> 00:49:38.498
On that, Caduceus you take...

1424
00:49:39.672 --> 00:49:44.447
Ooh, that is 28 points of bludgeoning damage.

1425
00:49:44.447 --> 00:49:45.680
Everyone else takes 14.

1426
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.155
LAURA: Poor Caduceus.
TALIESIN: 28 points

1427
00:49:47.155 --> 00:49:50.554
of bludgeoning damage.
MARISHA: I still take 14?

1428
00:49:50.554 --> 00:49:52.266
MATT: Yes.

1429
00:49:52.266 --> 00:49:55.065
TALIESIN: What's the concentration check on that?

1430
00:49:55.065 --> 00:49:57.240
MATT: This whole space here--

1431
00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.374
by the way, this is obliterated.

1432
00:49:58.374 --> 00:50:00.340
Everything you guys were standing on is destroyed.

1433
00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.240
TRAVIS: Whoa!
MATT: All this is gone.

1434
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.696
This whole space is considered rough terrain.

1435
00:50:05.696 --> 00:50:08.670
As you land in the middle of this giant area,

1436
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.908
and rock shards everywhere.

1437
00:50:10.908 --> 00:50:11.741
TRAVIS: Cool.

1438
00:50:11.741 --> 00:50:12.574
TALIESIN: I've got to roll a

1439
00:50:12.574 --> 00:50:13.990
concentration check really quickly.

1440
00:50:15.534 --> 00:50:17.642
For 28 points.
MATT: Actually,

1441
00:50:17.642 --> 00:50:18.691
technically, Caduceus?

1442
00:50:18.691 --> 00:50:20.067
Looking at it now where you guys were placed,

1443
00:50:20.067 --> 00:50:21.118
you would be out of the cube.

1444
00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:21.997
TALIESIN: Oh well, that's nice, nevermind.

1445
00:50:21.997 --> 00:50:22.834
MATT: Actually you take no damage.

1446
00:50:22.834 --> 00:50:23.981
I'll admit that now.

1447
00:50:23.981 --> 00:50:25.291
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: You're welcome.

1448
00:50:25.291 --> 00:50:27.453
Yeah. Because it knew where the three of you were,

1449
00:50:27.453 --> 00:50:28.649
I thought you were within the vicinity,

1450
00:50:28.649 --> 00:50:30.007
but looking at this, no.

1451
00:50:30.007 --> 00:50:32.485
You just step out of the way as the stone misses

1452
00:50:32.485 --> 00:50:34.719
the front of your face.
TALIESIN: Oh, okay!

1453
00:50:34.719 --> 00:50:36.661
MATT: The rock crumbles into this giant pile

1454
00:50:36.661 --> 00:50:39.804
and it's jagged stone everywhere in that space.

1455
00:50:39.804 --> 00:50:42.213
Okay.
TALIESIN: Wow.

1456
00:50:42.213 --> 00:50:43.651
MATT: As that happens,

1457
00:50:43.651 --> 00:50:45.718
this figures going to move back over to here

1458
00:50:45.718 --> 00:50:50.718
and is reaching down for a boulder on the ground.

1459
00:50:51.378 --> 00:50:53.151
That finishes its go. Caleb you're up.

1460
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:55.386
LIAM: Okay, so the wall just erupted next to me

1461
00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:56.753
and that all looks like hell,

1462
00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:59.874
so I am going to--you described a crack opening

1463
00:50:59.874 --> 00:51:02.092
in the doorway, so the giant cat's claw

1464
00:51:02.092 --> 00:51:03.618
is going to reach into there

1465
00:51:03.618 --> 00:51:05.241
and try to rip the door away.

1466
00:51:05.241 --> 00:51:07.598
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll for damage on that.

1467
00:51:07.598 --> 00:51:08.841
Roll for attack and damage.

1468
00:51:08.841 --> 00:51:10.495
LIAM: Attack and damage, yeah.

1469
00:51:10.495 --> 00:51:12.328
LAURA: There's no wall anymore.

1470
00:51:12.328 --> 00:51:13.803
Why are you still trying to open the gate?

1471
00:51:13.803 --> 00:51:15.055
LIAM: I have reasons.

1472
00:51:15.055 --> 00:51:18.613
Just an 11 on the door to hit.

1473
00:51:18.613 --> 00:51:19.664
MATT: Hey, it still hits; it's a door.

1474
00:51:19.664 --> 00:51:22.035
LIAM: Okay, that's what I was hoping.

1475
00:51:22.035 --> 00:51:23.951
TRAVIS: Not <i>just</i> hit it when it comes to doors.

1476
00:51:23.951 --> 00:51:24.784
MARISHA: Yeah.

1477
00:51:24.784 --> 00:51:26.279
MARISHA: Arch nemesis.

1478
00:51:26.279 --> 00:51:27.810
MATT: Doors have been a problem in the past.

1479
00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.659
LIAM: 20 force damage.
MATT: Okay, yeah.

1480
00:51:29.659 --> 00:51:31.309
That will be enough.

1481
00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:35.579
You watch as this gate and the boulders in the vicinity

1482
00:51:35.579 --> 00:51:37.729
just explode out of the way,

1483
00:51:38.648 --> 00:51:41.599
causing this area, also, to be considered rough terrain.

1484
00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:42.665
LIAM: Yeah.

1485
00:51:42.665 --> 00:51:44.685
In that moment I quickly scan

1486
00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:46.212
and size up the situation

1487
00:51:46.212 --> 00:51:49.983
and I take full movement backwards

1488
00:51:49.983 --> 00:51:52.229
while the claw starts to move

1489
00:51:52.229 --> 00:51:53.656
towards the giant in the back.

1490
00:51:53.656 --> 00:51:55.657
MATT: All right, move 20 feet?

1491
00:51:55.657 --> 00:51:57.907
LIAM: And will go up--it can go 60 feet.

1492
00:51:57.907 --> 00:51:59.229
MATT: All right.
LIAM: It's going to go

1493
00:51:59.229 --> 00:52:00.907
in an upward trajectory so it's floating

1494
00:52:00.907 --> 00:52:03.957
maybe 20 or 30 feet in the air above this giant.

1495
00:52:03.957 --> 00:52:06.111
TALIESIN: Hey!

1496
00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:06.944
LIAM: Claws out.

1497
00:52:09.186 --> 00:52:10.027
MATT: You got it.

1498
00:52:10.027 --> 00:52:10.911
And you're moving

1499
00:52:10.911 --> 00:52:12.954
back this way?
LIAM: Yeah, straight back.

1500
00:52:12.954 --> 00:52:13.799
So I can still see--

1501
00:52:13.799 --> 00:52:15.977
SAM: Can you punch with that thing?

1502
00:52:15.977 --> 00:52:16.810
LIAM: Yeah.

1503
00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:17.643
TALIESIN: Meow.

1504
00:52:17.643 --> 00:52:18.730
MARISHA: Meow.

1505
00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:19.563
MATT: All righty.

1506
00:52:19.563 --> 00:52:20.399
That ends your turn, Caleb?

1507
00:52:20.399 --> 00:52:22.424
LIAM: Meow.
MATT: Jester, you're up.

1508
00:52:22.424 --> 00:52:23.824
LAURA: Okay.

1509
00:52:23.824 --> 00:52:26.059
Well, I see the giant cat claw

1510
00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:28.524
and I see the wall that exploded.

1511
00:52:28.524 --> 00:52:30.142
(laughter)

1512
00:52:30.142 --> 00:52:32.134
I'm going to reach through the little slit

1513
00:52:32.134 --> 00:52:34.274
and go like la la la la,

1514
00:52:34.274 --> 00:52:35.911
and I'm going to cast Polymorph

1515
00:52:35.911 --> 00:52:38.824
on the big giant that's casting spells.

1516
00:52:38.824 --> 00:52:40.201
MATT: Okay!

1517
00:52:40.201 --> 00:52:43.328
ASHLEY: La la la la.
LAURA: La la.

1518
00:52:43.328 --> 00:52:44.628
MATT: That's a natural five.

1519
00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:46.404
LAURA: Yes!
MATT: I don't think--

1520
00:52:46.404 --> 00:52:50.108
it's a plus six on save?

1521
00:52:50.108 --> 00:52:50.941
LAURA: That doesn't hit 17.

1522
00:52:50.941 --> 00:52:52.557
MATT: No, it does not.

1523
00:52:52.557 --> 00:52:53.855
What do you turn it into?

1524
00:52:53.855 --> 00:52:56.822
LAURA: I'm going to say: I hope you like the ocean!

1525
00:52:56.822 --> 00:53:01.119
And I'm going to turn him into a killer whale.

1526
00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:04.310
MATT: Okay, I don't have a killer whale mini on me.

1527
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:05.870
TRAVIS: (aghast) Why not?
MATT: I know.

1528
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.269
LIAM: What a failure.

1529
00:53:07.269 --> 00:53:09.095
MATT: I'll consider the horse as the--

1530
00:53:09.095 --> 00:53:10.528
(laughter)

1531
00:53:10.528 --> 00:53:11.361
TRAVIS: Wow!

1532
00:53:12.815 --> 00:53:15.568
MATT: You (chuckles) watch as it's grabbing the rock.

1533
00:53:15.568 --> 00:53:17.267
You see the giant cat claw coming towards it,

1534
00:53:17.267 --> 00:53:18.855
and it's eyes darting around.

1535
00:53:18.855 --> 00:53:22.003
(panting) It grabs its staff

1536
00:53:22.003 --> 00:53:23.916
and you can see it beginning to cast

1537
00:53:23.916 --> 00:53:25.683
another incantation through its fingers in the staff,

1538
00:53:25.683 --> 00:53:29.208
and then (plopping)

1539
00:53:29.208 --> 00:53:32.072
(grunting) Flopping around on the floor.

1540
00:53:32.072 --> 00:53:33.255
TRAVIS: That's a good killer whale sound.

1541
00:53:33.255 --> 00:53:34.841
(whale sounds)

1542
00:53:34.841 --> 00:53:36.349
LAURA: When they're not underwater,

1543
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:37.240
it doesn't sound as majestic.

1544
00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.315
MATT: Not really.

1545
00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:39.823
LAURA: It's like (wet grunting)

1546
00:53:39.823 --> 00:53:41.806
MATT: All right.

1547
00:53:41.806 --> 00:53:43.110
That's your action?

1548
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.027
LAURA: That's my action; cast the spell.

1549
00:53:47.898 --> 00:53:52.211
Then, I guess I'm going to turn my focus

1550
00:53:52.211 --> 00:53:55.420
over to the other guys,

1551
00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.084
and then I don't have any really bonus actions

1552
00:53:57.084 --> 00:53:59.181
I can do.
MATT: Okay.

1553
00:53:59.181 --> 00:54:00.744
LAURA: Yeah, so I'm going to stay there.

1554
00:54:00.744 --> 00:54:01.586
MATT: That finished your turn, Jester.

1555
00:54:01.586 --> 00:54:02.444
All right, Nott?

1556
00:54:02.444 --> 00:54:03.602
LIAM: I have a minor clarification?

1557
00:54:03.602 --> 00:54:04.896
MATT: Yes?
LAURA: I'll lift Nott up

1558
00:54:04.896 --> 00:54:06.953
so that, I'm going to use my bonus to--

1559
00:54:06.953 --> 00:54:08.445
MATT: To lift--I'll allow it, okay.

1560
00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:10.732
LIAM: Minor clarification, I had meant for that cat's claw

1561
00:54:10.732 --> 00:54:14.362
to be 15 or 20 feet higher in the sky.

1562
00:54:14.362 --> 00:54:15.359
MATT: Like that?
LIAM: Yeah.

1563
00:54:15.359 --> 00:54:17.203
MATT: Sure.
LIAM: Thank you.

1564
00:54:17.203 --> 00:54:19.405
TRAVIS: Nice.
TALIESIN: We have ways.

1565
00:54:19.405 --> 00:54:20.849
MATT: There you go.
LIAM: Thank you.

1566
00:54:20.849 --> 00:54:22.280
MATT: No worries.

1567
00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.158
All right, Nott?

1568
00:54:25.541 --> 00:54:30.541
SAM: Boy, so are we trying to kill these guys or what?

1569
00:54:30.815 --> 00:54:32.806
Oh boy.

1570
00:54:32.806 --> 00:54:33.856
TRAVIS: Kind of an endless loop,

1571
00:54:33.856 --> 00:54:35.716
because even if I say: Listen to Caduceus!

1572
00:54:35.716 --> 00:54:37.007
It sounds like (speaking gibberish).

1573
00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.958
TALIESIN: They don't know my name.

1574
00:54:38.958 --> 00:54:40.625
LAURA: That's true.
SAM: Man.

1575
00:54:41.783 --> 00:54:44.415
They've probably got a lot of hit points, too.

1576
00:54:44.415 --> 00:54:45.795
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1577
00:54:45.795 --> 00:54:48.043
SAM: Have we done some damage, looking out at these guys?

1578
00:54:48.043 --> 00:54:49.742
These two?
MATT: This one's untouched.

1579
00:54:49.742 --> 00:54:51.017
SAM: Uh huh.
MATT: This one's taken

1580
00:54:51.017 --> 00:54:53.360
a fair amount of damage. It's looking cut up

1581
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.163
and it's looking like it's taken some hits.

1582
00:54:57.205 --> 00:54:59.052
The one back there has also taken a little bit of damage,

1583
00:54:59.052 --> 00:55:00.214
but it now a giant whale.

1584
00:55:00.214 --> 00:55:01.389
SAM: Yeah, sure, sure.

1585
00:55:01.389 --> 00:55:04.799
All right, I guess I'll target--

1586
00:55:04.799 --> 00:55:06.582
I don't know what to do.

1587
00:55:06.582 --> 00:55:09.496
I guess I'll target the one that hasn't been touched yet.

1588
00:55:09.496 --> 00:55:12.205
MATT: Okay.
SAM: And I will cast

1589
00:55:12.205 --> 00:55:15.494
Phantasmal Force on it.

1590
00:55:15.494 --> 00:55:16.627
MATT: Okay.

1591
00:55:16.627 --> 00:55:19.539
SAM: I will just rub a little bit of fleece

1592
00:55:19.539 --> 00:55:21.410
and cast Phantasmal Force,

1593
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:24.279
and if it succeeds--let's find out.

1594
00:55:24.279 --> 00:55:27.171
It has to make an intelligence save of 15.

1595
00:55:28.063 --> 00:55:29.618
MATT: No, it does not.

1596
00:55:29.618 --> 00:55:30.451
That is a four.

1597
00:55:30.451 --> 00:55:31.334
TALIESIN: Where have these rolls been

1598
00:55:31.334 --> 00:55:32.242
our whole lives, man?

1599
00:55:32.242 --> 00:55:33.295
This is nice.

1600
00:55:33.295 --> 00:55:35.611
MATT: It's in your favor this game, apparently.

1601
00:55:35.611 --> 00:55:38.583
SAM: I'm going to say that, ah shit,

1602
00:55:39.558 --> 00:55:42.616
that the club in its hand... No.

1603
00:55:43.699 --> 00:55:45.723
TRAVIS: (imitates Sam) No.
MATT: What are you doing?

1604
00:55:45.723 --> 00:55:47.283
SAM: What would make it run away?

1605
00:55:47.283 --> 00:55:49.260
I don't know, the club in its hand

1606
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:52.153
it now perceives to be on fire

1607
00:55:52.153 --> 00:55:53.945
and the fire is licking it,

1608
00:55:53.945 --> 00:55:56.072
and actually that will cause some damage, too.

1609
00:55:56.072 --> 00:55:57.535
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1610
00:55:57.535 --> 00:55:59.602
SAM: The damage is,

1611
00:55:59.602 --> 00:56:01.228
I think it's just 1d6, I think.

1612
00:56:01.228 --> 00:56:02.964
Yes, it's six.

1613
00:56:02.964 --> 00:56:04.865
Okay, three points of fire--

1614
00:56:04.865 --> 00:56:05.959
well, psychic damage.
MATT: Right,

1615
00:56:05.959 --> 00:56:07.210
three points of psychic damage

1616
00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:08.043
and it has to...?

1617
00:56:09.818 --> 00:56:10.659
SAM: That's it.

1618
00:56:10.659 --> 00:56:13.094
It thinks that its club is on fire

1619
00:56:13.094 --> 00:56:15.015
and hurting it.
MATT: Okay, good.

1620
00:56:15.015 --> 00:56:16.550
Well, it's its turn.

1621
00:56:20.217 --> 00:56:21.050
Yeah, on that note.

1622
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:22.418
It takes its club and goes, "Ah!"

1623
00:56:22.418 --> 00:56:24.192
And throws the club to the ground.

1624
00:56:24.192 --> 00:56:25.507
So it (thunking) hits.

1625
00:56:25.507 --> 00:56:26.504
Its club is currently,

1626
00:56:26.504 --> 00:56:27.760
it's not even touching it

1627
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.506
and it's sort of backing away.

1628
00:56:29.506 --> 00:56:31.314
It looks over towards you and is

1629
00:56:31.314 --> 00:56:32.613
kind of looking down at you and is like,

1630
00:56:32.613 --> 00:56:34.299
what do I do?

1631
00:56:34.299 --> 00:56:36.694
It spends its action throwing the club

1632
00:56:36.694 --> 00:56:39.890
on the ground and freaking out and trying to figure out,

1633
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:42.028
what do you want?

1634
00:56:42.028 --> 00:56:43.577
TRAVIS: What do I do, dad?

1635
00:56:43.577 --> 00:56:45.065
SAM: Then I'm going to run down the steps.

1636
00:56:45.065 --> 00:56:47.199
I'll shake free of Jester.

1637
00:56:47.199 --> 00:56:49.674
LAURA: Bah!
SAM: I'll run down the steps.

1638
00:56:49.674 --> 00:56:51.376
Can I get all the way to the bottom floor?

1639
00:56:51.376 --> 00:56:52.209
MATT: There is a trap door.

1640
00:56:52.209 --> 00:56:53.304
Do you want to open the trap door?

1641
00:56:53.304 --> 00:56:54.214
SAM: Yes, please.
MATT: Okay, open it.

1642
00:56:54.214 --> 00:56:55.338
It's not locked.

1643
00:56:55.338 --> 00:56:56.171
(squeaks) It opens up,

1644
00:56:56.171 --> 00:56:59.399
there's another ladder and you leap down inside.

1645
00:56:59.399 --> 00:57:00.901
LIAM: Oh, so cool.
MATT: Now you are

1646
00:57:00.901 --> 00:57:02.663
inside this chamber.

1647
00:57:02.663 --> 00:57:03.839
The door is partially open.

1648
00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:04.971
You can step out if you want to.

1649
00:57:04.971 --> 00:57:07.243
SAM: I will bonus action Dash down and out.

1650
00:57:07.243 --> 00:57:08.666
MATT: All right,

1651
00:57:08.666 --> 00:57:09.933
you are now out on this battlefield.

1652
00:57:09.933 --> 00:57:12.390
Do you want to, with your full movement there, at 35--

1653
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:13.223
SAM: I don't want to be in the open.

1654
00:57:13.223 --> 00:57:14.767
Just peeking around.
MATT: Okay.

1655
00:57:14.767 --> 00:57:16.285
SAM: That's it.
MATT: So if you want to be

1656
00:57:16.285 --> 00:57:17.855
outside you can like dart down behind this--

1657
00:57:17.855 --> 00:57:18.771
SAM: That sounds good, too.

1658
00:57:18.771 --> 00:57:19.872
(mini clattering)
LAURA: Oh no!

1659
00:57:19.872 --> 00:57:21.956
TALIESIN: Jester!
LIAM: It's gone forever.

1660
00:57:21.956 --> 00:57:23.424
Start the ritual.
TRAVIS: Yee-haw!

1661
00:57:23.424 --> 00:57:24.861
Dance with the dead.

1662
00:57:24.861 --> 00:57:26.639
MATT: All right.

1663
00:57:26.639 --> 00:57:27.630
That finishes your turn, Nott?

1664
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:29.136
Finishes the giant's go.

1665
00:57:29.136 --> 00:57:30.777
LAURA: It's crooked-y.

1666
00:57:30.777 --> 00:57:31.619
MATT: There you go.

1667
00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:33.989
TALIESIN: Things will settle as the earth moves.

1668
00:57:33.989 --> 00:57:35.400
There we are.

1669
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.601
MATT: Yeah, one of them is stunned,

1670
00:57:36.601 --> 00:57:38.124
the other one threw its club to the ground.

1671
00:57:38.124 --> 00:57:40.014
It's looking at Fjord, doesn't know what to do.

1672
00:57:40.014 --> 00:57:45.014
It sees you guys are still there angrily attacking.

1673
00:57:45.086 --> 00:57:46.526
It heard Caduceus yelling.

1674
00:57:46.526 --> 00:57:51.116
It's generally confused, and it's seeing Caleb casting shit.

1675
00:57:51.116 --> 00:57:53.366
(groaning)

1676
00:57:54.778 --> 00:57:57.557
Yeah, no, it's succumbing to the illusion

1677
00:57:57.557 --> 00:58:00.315
and it's going to slowly back away.

1678
00:58:01.917 --> 00:58:06.551
As it does, both Fjord and... uh, Beau,

1679
00:58:06.551 --> 00:58:08.326
no, Beau's a little too far away, unfortunately.

1680
00:58:08.326 --> 00:58:09.700
No, you did land there.

1681
00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.128
Beau, you can take an attack opportunity

1682
00:58:11.128 --> 00:58:13.745
if you'd like.
MARISHA: I will not.

1683
00:58:13.745 --> 00:58:15.282
MATT: Okay, Fjord?
TRAVIS: I will not.

1684
00:58:15.282 --> 00:58:17.703
MATT: Okay, he's going to step back,

1685
00:58:17.703 --> 00:58:20.085
then it turns and looks at the whale on the ground

1686
00:58:20.085 --> 00:58:21.043
and he goes.

1687
00:58:21.043 --> 00:58:24.078
(laughter)

1688
00:58:24.078 --> 00:58:24.911
Very confused now.

1689
00:58:24.911 --> 00:58:26.487
LAURA: (groaning sounds)

1690
00:58:26.487 --> 00:58:28.294
The giant floating cat's claw.

1691
00:58:28.294 --> 00:58:29.544
D&amp;D, you guys.

1692
00:58:29.544 --> 00:58:31.801
All right (giggles) that finishes their go.

1693
00:58:31.801 --> 00:58:33.136
Top of the round. Beau, you're up.

1694
00:58:33.136 --> 00:58:35.346
MARISHA: I am going to hold my turn

1695
00:58:35.346 --> 00:58:37.619
until Fjord talks to them one last time.

1696
00:58:37.619 --> 00:58:40.107
If they look aggro, then I attack.

1697
00:58:40.107 --> 00:58:42.082
MATT: Okay, end of your turn, this guys is

1698
00:58:42.082 --> 00:58:42.915
no longer stunned.

1699
00:58:42.915 --> 00:58:45.263
He is hurt, holding his club he like

1700
00:58:45.263 --> 00:58:47.827
(coughing) begins coughing.

1701
00:58:47.827 --> 00:58:49.778
MARISHA: I wait for Fjord and I go--

1702
00:58:52.136 --> 00:58:54.678
to him and I hold my action.
MATT: Okay, all right.

1703
00:58:54.678 --> 00:58:56.315
What are you holding your action for?

1704
00:58:56.315 --> 00:58:58.353
MARISHA: I'm going to wait for Fjord to talk.

1705
00:58:58.353 --> 00:58:59.689
MATT: And if things go poorly?

1706
00:58:59.689 --> 00:59:01.461
MARISHA: And if things go poorly, then I go.

1707
00:59:01.461 --> 00:59:02.740
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: Then I'll fuck him up.

1708
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:03.881
MARISHA: Yeah.

1709
00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:05.872
MATT: Fjord, Yasha, it's your turn

1710
00:59:05.872 --> 00:59:08.363
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do my best

1711
00:59:09.505 --> 00:59:11.480
stewardess impression,

1712
00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.947
and I say: Ahem!

1713
00:59:14.914 --> 00:59:17.105
Nuh uh uh.

1714
00:59:17.105 --> 00:59:20.990
(grunting)

1715
00:59:22.531 --> 00:59:23.364
TRAVIS: Make a persuasion check.

1716
00:59:23.364 --> 00:59:25.072
(laughter)

1717
00:59:25.072 --> 00:59:27.394
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

1718
00:59:27.394 --> 00:59:29.350
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's going to work. 16!

1719
00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:30.952
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: I think.

1720
00:59:30.952 --> 00:59:33.229
MATT: All right, so both of them,

1721
00:59:33.229 --> 00:59:34.552
looking at the whale and looking back at you.

1722
00:59:34.552 --> 00:59:36.245
TRAVIS: Oh, oh yeah.
SAM: Does Bless make--?

1723
00:59:36.245 --> 00:59:37.078
TALIESIN: Only for saves and attacks.

1724
00:59:37.078 --> 00:59:37.911
MATT: Only for saves, yeah.

1725
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:39.736
Not ability checks.

1726
00:59:39.736 --> 00:59:40.759
Nice try, though.

1727
00:59:40.759 --> 00:59:43.084
That one looks back and they both look at you

1728
00:59:43.084 --> 00:59:44.463
and it's like, ooh, has the club and it's ready

1729
00:59:44.463 --> 00:59:46.115
to bear down on Beau,

1730
00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:49.753
the eyes meet, and then it looks at you.

1731
00:59:49.753 --> 00:59:50.786
Looks back at the whale.

1732
00:59:50.786 --> 00:59:54.042
(laughter)

1733
00:59:54.042 --> 00:59:56.042
They look at each other.

1734
00:59:57.823 --> 01:00:00.236
One takes its club and sets it there

1735
01:00:00.236 --> 01:00:02.134
and sits down on the ground.

1736
01:00:02.134 --> 01:00:03.434
The other one that doesn't have its club,

1737
01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:06.851
looks a little frazzled and like,

1738
01:00:08.554 --> 01:00:09.775
and sits, but eyes are still wide.

1739
01:00:09.775 --> 01:00:12.999
The whale is (flopping).

1740
01:00:12.999 --> 01:00:16.699
TRAVIS: We got about 54 minutes left.

1741
01:00:16.699 --> 01:00:19.277
SAM: Well, I assume the whale will--

1742
01:00:19.277 --> 01:00:23.849
I assume the whale will lose its breath before that,

1743
01:00:23.849 --> 01:00:27.355
well before that, and come back to life as a giant?

1744
01:00:27.355 --> 01:00:28.763
TRAVIS: It's a mammal.
MARISHA: They're mammals.

1745
01:00:28.763 --> 01:00:30.733
MATT: They breathe air.
SAM: They breathe air!

1746
01:00:30.733 --> 01:00:31.798
MARISHA: They're mammals!

1747
01:00:31.798 --> 01:00:35.548
SAM: Don't they need water to live or something?

1748
01:00:36.729 --> 01:00:40.334
Huh, water is such a mysterious thing.

1749
01:00:40.334 --> 01:00:42.754
(laughter)

1750
01:00:42.754 --> 01:00:43.896
TALIESIN: We've got a solid hour.

1751
01:00:43.896 --> 01:00:45.286
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

1752
01:00:45.286 --> 01:00:46.410
TALIESIN: We can conjure water if we need to.

1753
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.310
MATT: So, Caduceus?

1754
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.385
Yasha, anything?

1755
01:00:48.385 --> 01:00:51.293
TALIESIN: I'm actually going to

1756
01:00:51.293 --> 01:00:53.276
walk out into this.
MATT: Yeah well, Yasha,

1757
01:00:53.276 --> 01:00:54.421
I think, was before you, actually.

1758
01:00:54.421 --> 01:00:55.688
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

1759
01:00:55.688 --> 01:00:57.015
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to--

1760
01:00:57.015 --> 01:00:58.157
oh, I already am on the ground.

1761
01:00:58.157 --> 01:00:59.806
MATT: Yes, you're standing on some of the rubble.

1762
01:00:59.806 --> 01:01:01.743
ASHLEY: Is this one's club anywhere close by?

1763
01:01:01.743 --> 01:01:02.935
MATT: Yeah, it's right in front of Fjord.

1764
01:01:02.935 --> 01:01:04.487
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to grab it

1765
01:01:04.487 --> 01:01:07.373
and make sure I keep it so it can't pick it back up,

1766
01:01:07.373 --> 01:01:08.607
in case something happens.

1767
01:01:08.607 --> 01:01:10.276
MATT: Okay, the other giant goes like (grunts)

1768
01:01:10.276 --> 01:01:11.874
and puts its hand up, because it watches you grab

1769
01:01:11.874 --> 01:01:13.369
a burning club and carry it off.

1770
01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:16.216
ASHLEY: I just, you know, it's okay, it's okay.

1771
01:01:16.216 --> 01:01:18.194
MATT: It's impressed how you're withstanding

1772
01:01:18.194 --> 01:01:19.953
this roaring inferno that you're clutching your arms,

1773
01:01:19.953 --> 01:01:23.511
that is not actually there.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1774
01:01:23.511 --> 01:01:25.813
MATT: Okay, and are you moving?

1775
01:01:25.813 --> 01:01:27.088
ASHLEY: Yeah, because I don't--

1776
01:01:27.088 --> 01:01:28.545
MATT: Or are you just?

1777
01:01:28.545 --> 01:01:31.406
ASHLEY: Yeah, actually, I want to move a little bit closer

1778
01:01:31.406 --> 01:01:33.597
this way like towards the bigger one,

1779
01:01:33.597 --> 01:01:34.727
just in case if something.

1780
01:01:34.727 --> 01:01:36.168
I mean, still close to the wall.

1781
01:01:36.168 --> 01:01:38.244
MATT: Okay, so like this way?
ASHLEY: Just in case of...

1782
01:01:38.244 --> 01:01:39.539
MATT: You got it.

1783
01:01:39.539 --> 01:01:41.503
ASHLEY: For a next up, if something happens.

1784
01:01:41.503 --> 01:01:43.501
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go? Caduceus.

1785
01:01:43.501 --> 01:01:44.981
TALIESIN: I'm going to try

1786
01:01:44.981 --> 01:01:47.989
and walk out into this un-threateningly.

1787
01:01:47.989 --> 01:01:50.156
LIAM: That's awesome.
MATT: 25, 30.

1788
01:01:51.148 --> 01:01:52.911
TALIESIN: Perfect.
MATT: You'll get about there

1789
01:01:52.911 --> 01:01:54.152
with your movement.

1790
01:01:54.152 --> 01:01:56.406
TALIESIN: Very quickly, going to do the--

1791
01:01:56.406 --> 01:01:58.267
Everybody give it a second, one second.

1792
01:01:58.267 --> 01:02:00.520
In Giant, I'm going to put out there,

1793
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.754
This seems very unnecessary.

1794
01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:06.217
I get the sense that this is a misunderstanding

1795
01:02:06.217 --> 01:02:08.151
and we would be happy to talk

1796
01:02:08.151 --> 01:02:10.393
about whatever situation is going on here.

1797
01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:13.295
Nothing bad has to happen here.

1798
01:02:13.295 --> 01:02:15.836
This feels wrong.

1799
01:02:17.028 --> 01:02:18.294
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1800
01:02:18.294 --> 01:02:19.560
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1801
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.945
LIAM: Get it.
TALIESIN: (grumbling)

1802
01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:22.168
(Travis imitates Taliesin)

1803
01:02:23.793 --> 01:02:24.626
TALIESIN: Six?

1804
01:02:24.626 --> 01:02:26.362
ASHLEY: With advantages?

1805
01:02:26.362 --> 01:02:27.667
(Matt chuckling)
TALIESIN: No, no advantage.

1806
01:02:27.667 --> 01:02:28.976
ASHLEY: 'Cause he speaks it good?

1807
01:02:28.976 --> 01:02:30.714
MATT: They're listening.

1808
01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:32.320
The moods haven't shifted necessarily.

1809
01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.088
TALIESIN: Who's in charge?

1810
01:02:34.088 --> 01:02:35.336
MATT: You say that?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1811
01:02:35.336 --> 01:02:37.544
MATT: Both of them sit and look over towards the whale.

1812
01:02:37.544 --> 01:02:39.260
(Sam chuckling)

1813
01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.276
TALIESIN: Do you mind sitting quietly for a little while

1814
01:02:41.276 --> 01:02:42.886
while we figure this out?

1815
01:02:42.886 --> 01:02:44.890
MATT: One of them is confused,

1816
01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:46.245
the other looks particularly freaked

1817
01:02:46.245 --> 01:02:48.005
and is still staring straight at Yasha.

1818
01:02:48.005 --> 01:02:50.230
From its perspective, is holding a pyre in her arms

1819
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:52.430
that should be burning her to ashes,

1820
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:53.280
and is just like--

1821
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.628
TALIESIN: She's almost as scared

1822
01:02:54.628 --> 01:02:56.137
of you as you are of her.

1823
01:02:56.137 --> 01:02:57.673
I mean, almost.

1824
01:02:57.673 --> 01:02:59.418
MATT: All right. The rest of you guys--

1825
01:02:59.418 --> 01:03:02.214
Effectively, while you're holding Polymorph

1826
01:03:02.214 --> 01:03:03.726
and there's nothing breaking it,

1827
01:03:03.726 --> 01:03:05.730
combat at the moment has come to a halt.

1828
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:07.511
LAURA: I'll come down out of the tower, then.

1829
01:03:07.511 --> 01:03:09.137
MATT: Okay.
SAM: I'm going to go towards

1830
01:03:09.137 --> 01:03:10.977
the other tower and keep an eye

1831
01:03:10.977 --> 01:03:12.413
on the rest of the camp to see

1832
01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:14.902
if any other giants walk our way.

1833
01:03:14.902 --> 01:03:16.175
TRAVIS: Cool.
MATT: Okay, so you're going

1834
01:03:16.175 --> 01:03:17.781
to the other tower?
SAM: Not up it,

1835
01:03:17.781 --> 01:03:21.283
just over there in that other corner of the volume.

1836
01:03:21.283 --> 01:03:23.085
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I'm going to walk over

1837
01:03:23.085 --> 01:03:26.493
to the whale and pet it.

1838
01:03:26.493 --> 01:03:28.871
And say: I'm really sorry that it had to come to this.

1839
01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:30.499
I'm really sorry.

1840
01:03:30.499 --> 01:03:33.474
MATT: Okay, the head moves towards you and like,

1841
01:03:33.474 --> 01:03:35.054
from what you can see in the dark eye

1842
01:03:35.054 --> 01:03:37.493
that protrudes from the side of the blubber,

1843
01:03:37.493 --> 01:03:39.604
having never seen a whale before,

1844
01:03:39.604 --> 01:03:41.193
you can't read its emotions.

1845
01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:43.870
LIAM: You seem like a really nice kind of--

1846
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:45.140
MATT: Make a nature check.
LAURA: Oh, sweet.

1847
01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.390
TALIESIN: Oh yay.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

1848
01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:50.058
LIAM: Cat's Ire is gone by now, I would assume?

1849
01:03:50.974 --> 01:03:52.507
MARISHA: Wow, that had layers.

1850
01:03:52.507 --> 01:03:53.807
LAURA: Yeah, right?

1851
01:03:53.807 --> 01:03:55.496
MATT: It's probably been at this point

1852
01:03:55.496 --> 01:03:57.002
as you guys are coming in and getting to the end of it.

1853
01:03:57.002 --> 01:03:58.190
LIAM: Things are slowing down.

1854
01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:00.140
LAURA: Nine!
MATT: Nine, okay.

1855
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.592
You have no idea what emotions the whale has.

1856
01:04:02.592 --> 01:04:06.469
It's a whale, and it's flailing about.

1857
01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:08.415
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: But you pet it.

1858
01:04:08.415 --> 01:04:09.882
It can't assault you.

1859
01:04:09.882 --> 01:04:11.456
LAURA: I make sure I stay clear

1860
01:04:11.456 --> 01:04:13.728
of its tail and fins and shit.

1861
01:04:13.728 --> 01:04:17.041
TRAVIS: All right, we've got about 50 some odd minutes.

1862
01:04:17.041 --> 01:04:18.508
We should check the rest of the camp,

1863
01:04:18.508 --> 01:04:20.302
see what's what, and then we've got to find a way

1864
01:04:20.302 --> 01:04:21.956
to get these folks out of here.

1865
01:04:21.956 --> 01:04:23.985
TALIESIN: Well, I don't know.

1866
01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:25.295
I feel like we're missing part of the situation.

1867
01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:26.697
I feel like we're missing part of the story here.

1868
01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:29.529
I'd really like to--this seems weird, right?

1869
01:04:29.529 --> 01:04:30.646
Like what are they doing?

1870
01:04:30.646 --> 01:04:32.223
SAM: Maybe ask them what they need?

1871
01:04:32.223 --> 01:04:33.683
LIAM: Caduceus, yeah, talk to them.

1872
01:04:33.683 --> 01:04:35.165
MARISHA: They don't look happy.

1873
01:04:35.165 --> 01:04:36.757
SAM: Why are they here?

1874
01:04:36.757 --> 01:04:38.266
MARISHA: While you do that, I'm going to scavenge.

1875
01:04:38.266 --> 01:04:39.717
TRAVIS: I'll stay with Caduceus.

1876
01:04:39.717 --> 01:04:41.334
TALIESIN: Fjord, can I borrow you for a second?

1877
01:04:41.334 --> 01:04:42.400
TRAVIS: Yeah, please, mm hm.

1878
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.830
MARISHA: I look around, look over this busted cart,

1879
01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:46.759
and start scavenging.
MATT: Okay,

1880
01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:48.143
make an investigation check.

1881
01:04:48.143 --> 01:04:49.936
TRAVIS: I'll put my arm around Caduceus

1882
01:04:49.936 --> 01:04:52.686
as he starts to e-e-elucidate.
MATT: Okay.

1883
01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:57.033
TALIESIN: I'm very tall.

1884
01:04:58.283 --> 01:04:59.858
MARISHA: I rolled a a natural 19,

1885
01:04:59.858 --> 01:05:01.009
so 25.

1886
01:05:01.009 --> 01:05:02.300
MATT: 25, okay.

1887
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.216
Scavenging around the space here,

1888
01:05:04.216 --> 01:05:07.107
there's a lot of things used to defend

1889
01:05:07.107 --> 01:05:08.700
the outskirts of a fort.

1890
01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.627
Plenty of bolts and arrows,

1891
01:05:10.627 --> 01:05:12.760
and you can see resting in the corners

1892
01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.843
longbows, short bows, heavy crossbows.

1893
01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:19.411
The further in you get and look over in this space,

1894
01:05:19.411 --> 01:05:23.980
you can see there's raw ingots of iron and copper,

1895
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.253
you can other buildings in here are smelters.

1896
01:05:27.253 --> 01:05:32.159
The Steelworks here is designed to smelt down alloys

1897
01:05:32.159 --> 01:05:34.118
into a steel and then craft weapons.

1898
01:05:34.118 --> 01:05:36.439
You can see far off the machines

1899
01:05:36.439 --> 01:05:39.044
that are partially constructed are impressive,

1900
01:05:39.044 --> 01:05:40.464
though only partially made,

1901
01:05:40.464 --> 01:05:42.360
and some of them have been pulled apart

1902
01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.236
and elements of it scavenged by these giants, it looks like.

1903
01:05:44.236 --> 01:05:46.551
TRAVIS: Come on man, there are chests.

1904
01:05:46.551 --> 01:05:48.459
This is a Red Dead Redemption--

1905
01:05:48.459 --> 01:05:49.842
MARISHA: I know, I'm like, what about these chests?

1906
01:05:49.842 --> 01:05:51.327
What about that box over there?

1907
01:05:51.327 --> 01:05:52.549
What about that red thing?

1908
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:53.676
That red thing looks important.

1909
01:05:53.676 --> 01:05:54.869
SAM: It's a smelting chest.

1910
01:05:54.869 --> 01:05:56.146
MATT:You go and open the box

1911
01:05:56.146 --> 01:05:57.623
and you can see within there,

1912
01:05:57.623 --> 01:06:00.055
there is raw ore that hasn't been smelted yet.

1913
01:06:00.055 --> 01:06:02.176
Rough ore that's been carved and mined

1914
01:06:02.176 --> 01:06:03.517
and brought here that is currently waiting

1915
01:06:03.517 --> 01:06:04.816
to be next in that.

1916
01:06:04.816 --> 01:06:06.622
You get the sense that this space isn't an

1917
01:06:06.622 --> 01:06:08.522
open, middle-of-the-forest vault.

1918
01:06:08.522 --> 01:06:10.284
MARISHA: Right.
MATT: It is a Steelworks.

1919
01:06:10.284 --> 01:06:11.928
MARISHA: Talk to these assholes.

1920
01:06:11.928 --> 01:06:13.689
LIAM: While he's talking, I have moved closer,

1921
01:06:13.689 --> 01:06:16.100
much closer to the whale, watching Jester pet the whale,

1922
01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:19.532
and I am--in case this thing turns back into a giant,

1923
01:06:19.532 --> 01:06:22.365
I am ready with some ideas.
MATT: Okay.

1924
01:06:23.286 --> 01:06:25.986
TALIESIN: I am so sorry, what are your two names,

1925
01:06:25.986 --> 01:06:28.227
if you don't mind?

1926
01:06:28.227 --> 01:06:30.470
MATT: The one that's closest to you goes,

1927
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:32.226
"I am Duin."
TALIESIN: Duin?

1928
01:06:32.226 --> 01:06:34.362
Mister Duin, I work for Mister Fjord here

1929
01:06:34.362 --> 01:06:38.838
and I help him deal with different--

1930
01:06:38.838 --> 01:06:41.425
(laughs) That threw me.

1931
01:06:41.425 --> 01:06:44.239
Help him deal with certain issues that arise

1932
01:06:44.239 --> 01:06:46.372
and we have a mission here today,

1933
01:06:46.372 --> 01:06:49.392
but we feel that maybe a part of that mission

1934
01:06:49.392 --> 01:06:53.002
could be helping you with, obviously--

1935
01:06:53.002 --> 01:06:54.943
What are you guys doing here?

1936
01:06:54.943 --> 01:06:58.681
This is just weird.
(laughter)

1937
01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.409
MATT: The giant, which even at your full height,

1938
01:07:00.409 --> 01:07:02.546
and it's sitting, is still looking down at you

1939
01:07:02.546 --> 01:07:03.812
at this point.

1940
01:07:05.679 --> 01:07:09.959
"Soorna be the one with more information,"

1941
01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.934
and he points towards the whale, but goes,

1942
01:07:14.301 --> 01:07:18.459
"We ran away from our home of the mountain.

1943
01:07:20.004 --> 01:07:23.087
"Something terrible is happening there

1944
01:07:23.945 --> 01:07:28.945
"and we came here because we needed a place to stay

1945
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:34.080
"and our weapons weren't as effective against these things.

1946
01:07:34.643 --> 01:07:38.217
"So we came for metal,

1947
01:07:38.217 --> 01:07:40.225
"hoping it would help,

1948
01:07:40.225 --> 01:07:44.567
"but then the people in here fought as well,

1949
01:07:44.567 --> 01:07:46.817
"and well, they're gone now.

1950
01:07:47.729 --> 01:07:49.529
"And so we're going to stay here."

1951
01:07:49.529 --> 01:07:52.993
TALIESIN: Well, I relay all that to you.

1952
01:07:52.993 --> 01:07:53.826
TRAVIS: Yep.

1953
01:07:53.826 --> 01:07:55.359
TALIESIN: Well that's the trouble

1954
01:07:55.359 --> 01:07:57.331
with people, is they may go for a time,

1955
01:07:57.331 --> 01:07:59.655
but they come back and there's a lot more of them, so.

1956
01:07:59.655 --> 01:08:02.480
MATT: "Then let them come."
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're--

1957
01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.181
I don't know why, but Mister Fjord

1958
01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:09.578
has definitely taken a shining to you two,

1959
01:08:09.578 --> 01:08:11.549
and we feel like we want to help.

1960
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:14.462
We feel like this is not a good situation for anyone,

1961
01:08:14.462 --> 01:08:16.971
and I feel like this could probably be resolved

1962
01:08:18.846 --> 01:08:21.729
pretty reasonably in a positive way for everybody.

1963
01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:25.092
Do you think your friend over there who is flopping,

1964
01:08:25.092 --> 01:08:27.294
what is that again?

1965
01:08:27.294 --> 01:08:29.451
That's some sort of--?

1966
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:31.646
TRAVIS: I don't understand what you're saying to me.

1967
01:08:31.646 --> 01:08:33.654
(Sam laughing)

1968
01:08:33.654 --> 01:08:36.558
TALIESIN: What is, oh--what kind of animal is that?

1969
01:08:36.558 --> 01:08:37.957
LAURA: It's a whale!
TRAVIS: A whale.

1970
01:08:37.957 --> 01:08:39.482
LAURA: Caduceus, it's a whale.

1971
01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:40.845
TALIESIN: I don't how to say whale in Giant.

1972
01:08:40.845 --> 01:08:42.337
LAURA: Say like a big fish.

1973
01:08:42.337 --> 01:08:43.719
SAM: Yeah, big fish.

1974
01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:45.778
TALIESIN: That real big fish.
(chuckling)

1975
01:08:45.778 --> 01:08:47.069
You're welcome.

1976
01:08:47.069 --> 01:08:48.344
LIAM: Tatonka.

1977
01:08:48.344 --> 01:08:50.470
TALIESIN: Tatonka. Okay, thank you.

1978
01:08:51.678 --> 01:08:53.652
Do you think you could help us

1979
01:08:53.652 --> 01:08:56.148
keep him calm for a second while we discuss things?

1980
01:08:56.148 --> 01:08:57.721
MATT: "We can try.

1981
01:08:57.721 --> 01:08:59.471
"She's a bit wound up."

1982
01:09:00.434 --> 01:09:02.208
TALIESIN: What was her name one more time?

1983
01:09:02.208 --> 01:09:04.363
MATT: "Soorna."
TALIESIN: Soorna, Miss Soorna.

1984
01:09:04.363 --> 01:09:07.613
All right, Mister Fjord--

1985
01:09:08.766 --> 01:09:11.425
I'm out of game, relaying
all this information to you.

1986
01:09:11.425 --> 01:09:13.312
TRAVIS: Mm hm, mm hm.

1987
01:09:13.312 --> 01:09:14.924
TALIESIN: Do you think this is a good plan?

1988
01:09:14.924 --> 01:09:17.802
TRAVIS: Trust your heart, Caduceus.

1989
01:09:17.802 --> 01:09:19.362
It's in a good place.

1990
01:09:19.362 --> 01:09:21.621
TALIESIN: I'm curious about what's in these mountains.

1991
01:09:21.621 --> 01:09:25.078
LAURA: Ask them what it is in the mountains.

1992
01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.262
TALIESIN: I don't think they really--

1993
01:09:27.262 --> 01:09:30.989
Do you have a name for what's in the mountains?

1994
01:09:30.989 --> 01:09:32.756
MATT: "I don't know.

1995
01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:37.226
"We were--we live in the small valley

1996
01:09:37.226 --> 01:09:40.706
in the mountain we call Braan,"

1997
01:09:40.706 --> 01:09:42.740
which you recognize in Giant means "belly."

1998
01:09:44.007 --> 01:09:45.639
TALIESIN: Hm, all right.

1999
01:09:45.639 --> 01:09:48.306
MATT: "Khialo began to hear something,

2000
01:09:50.277 --> 01:09:52.194
"this terrible, low hum.

2001
01:09:53.548 --> 01:09:57.623
"Like wind through the trees, but it didn't stop."

2002
01:09:57.623 --> 01:10:00.036
TALIESIN: I'm relaying all this everybody.

2003
01:10:00.036 --> 01:10:04.177
MATT: "These things came out of the shadows

2004
01:10:04.177 --> 01:10:07.610
"with wings and long faces

2005
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:10.760
"and we tried to swat them,

2006
01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.690
"but instead they all went after Khialo.

2007
01:10:18.651 --> 01:10:20.651
"Watched his life wither,

2008
01:10:21.533 --> 01:10:24.461
"and then more started coming, smaller.

2009
01:10:24.461 --> 01:10:26.467
"At feeling the strength draw from us,

2010
01:10:26.467 --> 01:10:29.717
"we were confused and scared, so we ran.

2011
01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.929
"Only Soorna went back and,

2012
01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:36.346
"when she returned, said never to go back.

2013
01:10:38.059 --> 01:10:39.476
"So here we are."

2014
01:10:42.937 --> 01:10:44.841
TRAVIS: Well, I would say

2015
01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:48.184
that we could go aid them in a fight,

2016
01:10:48.184 --> 01:10:50.865
but it doesn't sound like A) they would want to go back,

2017
01:10:50.865 --> 01:10:52.467
and B) me neither.

2018
01:10:53.342 --> 01:10:57.384
Maybe we just ask them to find a different place to hold up?

2019
01:10:58.923 --> 01:11:00.885
TALIESIN: Well, there's a lot of options here.

2020
01:11:00.885 --> 01:11:03.008
There's definitely going

2021
01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:06.244
and seeing what the commotion is about,

2022
01:11:06.244 --> 01:11:08.924
because I don't like the sound of any of that.

2023
01:11:08.924 --> 01:11:11.832
LAURA: How big are the things that are attacking them?

2024
01:11:12.778 --> 01:11:15.953
TALIESIN: We may have to talk to the--

2025
01:11:16.828 --> 01:11:18.280
TRAVIS: The whale--
TALIESIN: Big fish.

2026
01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.723
TRAVIS: --is not charmed.

2027
01:11:19.723 --> 01:11:21.656
TALIESIN: That's fine.
TRAVIS: Nope, I dunno.

2028
01:11:21.656 --> 01:11:24.033
LAURA: But she's hearing everything that's going on, right?

2029
01:11:24.033 --> 01:11:25.529
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Eh...

2030
01:11:25.529 --> 01:11:27.530
TRAVIS: I wouldn't, nuh-uh.

2031
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:29.077
MATT: The whale might be, you don't know.

2032
01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:30.346
TRAVIS: Nuh-uh, nuh-uh.

2033
01:11:30.346 --> 01:11:32.111
LAURA: Maybe?
TRAVIS: Nuh-uh!

2034
01:11:32.111 --> 01:11:34.026
LAURA: Maybe we don't do that just yet?

2035
01:11:34.026 --> 01:11:36.904
TALIESIN: Ah.
LAURA: Maybe if her friends

2036
01:11:36.904 --> 01:11:39.017
told her that we were nice and stuff?

2037
01:11:39.017 --> 01:11:41.047
She sees we're not attacking.
TRAVIS: Lion in a cage,

2038
01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.589
much different than lion out of a cage.

2039
01:11:43.531 --> 01:11:47.989
TALIESIN: Ah, well, that is difficult.

2040
01:11:47.989 --> 01:11:49.543
The other option, of course,

2041
01:11:49.543 --> 01:11:50.837
is that we do convince them to leave

2042
01:11:50.837 --> 01:11:52.850
and if we can do that,

2043
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:55.974
there's also more options for humiliation

2044
01:11:55.974 --> 01:12:00.593
and a rebuttal of our friend back at the camp.

2045
01:12:00.593 --> 01:12:02.548
SAM: We can't convince them to leave without their friend.

2046
01:12:02.548 --> 01:12:04.684
They're not going to leave without the whale,

2047
01:12:04.684 --> 01:12:05.817
so we're going to have to bring

2048
01:12:05.817 --> 01:12:06.875
the whale back at some point.

2049
01:12:06.875 --> 01:12:08.435
LAURA: Plus, there are more of them here.

2050
01:12:08.435 --> 01:12:09.862
It's not like these are the only three.

2051
01:12:09.862 --> 01:12:11.936
ASHLEY: Ask them how many of them are there.

2052
01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:13.211
LAURA: Ooh yeah, that's a good question.

2053
01:12:13.211 --> 01:12:15.263
SAM: I think it's better to talk to the whale one when

2054
01:12:15.263 --> 01:12:16.525
there's only three of them, not several.

2055
01:12:16.525 --> 01:12:17.898
LIAM: Yeah, Caduceus.

2056
01:12:19.365 --> 01:12:20.804
TRAVIS: How many friends

2057
01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:22.403
do you have staying here right now,

2058
01:12:22.403 --> 01:12:24.167
if you don't mind me asking?

2059
01:12:24.167 --> 01:12:25.422
MATT: "There's eight total.

2060
01:12:25.422 --> 01:12:27.326
"The rest are out on a hunting party."

2061
01:12:27.326 --> 01:12:28.598
TALIESIN: Well, okay.
LAURA: When will they be back?

2062
01:12:28.598 --> 01:12:31.548
MATT: "Anytime."
LAURA: Oh, shoot.

2063
01:12:33.969 --> 01:12:37.971
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk over and I'm going to

2064
01:12:37.971 --> 01:12:41.452
very calmly to the two that are charmed,

2065
01:12:41.452 --> 01:12:45.818
I'm going to move killer whale's staff to the side.

2066
01:12:45.818 --> 01:12:47.218
Just for now.

2067
01:12:47.218 --> 01:12:48.267
LIAM: That would have schlurped in--

2068
01:12:48.267 --> 01:12:49.712
MATT: Yeah, the staff actually came

2069
01:12:49.712 --> 01:12:50.964
into the form of the whale.

2070
01:12:50.964 --> 01:12:52.394
ASHLEY: It's inside of her, nevermind.

2071
01:12:52.394 --> 01:12:53.702
MATT: You look for it, you're like,

2072
01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:55.024
I don't understand magic.

2073
01:12:55.024 --> 01:12:56.455
Where'd the staff go?

2074
01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:57.571
ASHLEY: Where did her staff go?

2075
01:12:57.571 --> 01:12:58.721
TRAVIS: We don't like anyone

2076
01:12:58.721 --> 01:13:00.628
being displaced from their home,

2077
01:13:00.628 --> 01:13:02.293
and if they will have us,

2078
01:13:02.293 --> 01:13:05.019
we will help them reclaim.

2079
01:13:05.019 --> 01:13:08.085
TALIESIN: I'm relaying this information.

2080
01:13:08.085 --> 01:13:09.596
MATT: They both look over at the whale

2081
01:13:09.596 --> 01:13:11.037
and they're like,

2082
01:13:13.212 --> 01:13:15.194
"We'd like to go home."

2083
01:13:15.194 --> 01:13:16.698
TALIESIN: Do you think you can help us

2084
01:13:16.698 --> 01:13:20.960
make sure that she doesn't restart a conflict

2085
01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.931
that is possibly more than the three of you

2086
01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:24.711
can handle right now?

2087
01:13:24.711 --> 01:13:26.367
(Matt sighs)

2088
01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:27.667
MATT: They both look at each other

2089
01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:29.053
and look at the whale, and you can see that

2090
01:13:29.053 --> 01:13:32.214
she's definitely like of a higher hierarchy

2091
01:13:32.214 --> 01:13:33.925
that both of them, and they go, "We can try."

2092
01:13:33.925 --> 01:13:36.054
LAURA: Is the whale still flopping around a lot,

2093
01:13:36.054 --> 01:13:37.686
or is the whale calm?

2094
01:13:37.686 --> 01:13:38.994
MATT: The whale is calm.
TRAVIS: Also note,

2095
01:13:38.994 --> 01:13:40.400
at the end of this hour,

2096
01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.754
they know that I charmed them.

2097
01:13:41.754 --> 01:13:43.383
We'd better hope that this is

2098
01:13:43.383 --> 01:13:45.074
really landing somewhere genuine.

2099
01:13:45.074 --> 01:13:47.070
Otherwise it's a rowdy time.

2100
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:48.021
TALIESIN: Sure.
LIAM: Caduceus,

2101
01:13:48.021 --> 01:13:50.000
based off of everything you have said,

2102
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.971
I feel like we could pick these three off

2103
01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:55.162
and then be ready for the next.

2104
01:13:55.162 --> 01:13:56.826
We seem to have outmatched these,

2105
01:13:56.826 --> 01:14:00.425
but if we are to deal with their problem,

2106
01:14:00.425 --> 01:14:03.580
can you ascertain if they are willing to back us up?

2107
01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:06.163
TALIESIN: That would be a conversation.

2108
01:14:07.912 --> 01:14:10.750
I get the sense they don't want to be here.

2109
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:11.833
LIAM: Yeah.

2110
01:14:13.486 --> 01:14:14.507
TALIESIN: I get the sense, also,

2111
01:14:14.507 --> 01:14:16.085
that we can probably have a conversation

2112
01:14:16.085 --> 01:14:19.047
about either finding something more permanent

2113
01:14:19.047 --> 01:14:22.529
that isn't this, or figuring out what this thing is.

2114
01:14:22.529 --> 01:14:24.414
LIAM: Well, I'll tell you, altruism is nice,

2115
01:14:24.414 --> 01:14:26.806
but it would be better with eight giants at our back.

2116
01:14:26.806 --> 01:14:28.670
TALIESIN: That's fair.
MARISHA: I mean,

2117
01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:31.290
they're still members of the Xhorhasian community, right?

2118
01:14:32.415 --> 01:14:36.057
Are we trying to help? I dunno.

2119
01:14:36.057 --> 01:14:37.727
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've seen giants walking around, right?

2120
01:14:37.727 --> 01:14:38.885
TALIESIN: I know I can be a little

2121
01:14:38.885 --> 01:14:41.835
on the soft end of things in here,

2122
01:14:41.835 --> 01:14:44.372
and I understand that that's not always the best decision.

2123
01:14:44.372 --> 01:14:46.326
I'll leave it to the group.

2124
01:14:46.326 --> 01:14:48.360
I think we can have that conversation, at least.

2125
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.909
MARISHA: I think having an awesome community of giants

2126
01:14:50.909 --> 01:14:52.936
as our allies could be super cool.

2127
01:14:52.936 --> 01:14:54.414
SAM: I think you're right.

2128
01:14:54.414 --> 01:14:55.456
That's a good idea.

2129
01:14:55.456 --> 01:14:56.925
LIAM: That is a no brainer.
SAM: Let's do this.

2130
01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:57.976
TRAVIS: Yep.

2131
01:14:57.976 --> 01:14:59.221
TALIESIN: Flip the whale.

2132
01:14:59.221 --> 01:15:00.787
(giggling)
MARISHA: Flip the whale!

2133
01:15:00.787 --> 01:15:02.170
LAURA: Okay, maybe tell them straight up

2134
01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:03.459
that you charmed them.

2135
01:15:03.459 --> 01:15:04.811
Maybe let them know,

2136
01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:06.356
just so that we can make it calmer

2137
01:15:06.356 --> 01:15:07.372
so that we can tell them.

2138
01:15:07.372 --> 01:15:08.283
TRAVIS: Maybe we try to calm them down

2139
01:15:08.283 --> 01:15:09.585
and also try talking to the whale.

2140
01:15:09.585 --> 01:15:11.228
TALIESIN: We have used a little but of magic

2141
01:15:11.228 --> 01:15:14.757
to keep you from getting too angry too quickly

2142
01:15:14.757 --> 01:15:16.988
at this conversation, but please understand

2143
01:15:16.988 --> 01:15:21.433
that everything that we've attempted to explain is genuine.

2144
01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:25.683
TRAVIS:They both look over at Fjord and kind of--

2145
01:15:28.163 --> 01:15:30.875
"Good idea."
(laughter)

2146
01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:32.658
TALIESIN: That's going to turn in a minute,

2147
01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:34.253
but sure, all right.

2148
01:15:34.253 --> 01:15:36.432
All right.
MATT: They both stand up.

2149
01:15:37.315 --> 01:15:39.231
(imitating rumbling)

2150
01:15:39.231 --> 01:15:42.148
Walk over, (imitating impact tremors) to the whale,

2151
01:15:42.148 --> 01:15:46.979
and both confused, put their hand on the whale.

2152
01:15:46.979 --> 01:15:48.322
Kind of lean into it.

2153
01:15:48.322 --> 01:15:51.267
The whale's like (grunting), just done.

2154
01:15:51.267 --> 01:15:52.788
LAURA: What is the whale's name again?

2155
01:15:52.788 --> 01:15:53.899
SAM: Oh, Soorna?

2156
01:15:53.899 --> 01:15:55.855
LAURA: "Soona"?

2157
01:15:55.855 --> 01:15:57.991
LAURA: Soorna I'm going--
MATT: Soorna.

2158
01:15:57.991 --> 01:16:00.833
LAURA: "Soo--"?
MATT: S-O-O-R-N-A.

2159
01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:02.320
Soorna.
LAURA: Soorna.

2160
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.819
TALIESIN: Soorna.
LAURA: Soorna.

2161
01:16:03.819 --> 01:16:08.405
Soorna, I am going to turn you back into you, okay?

2162
01:16:08.405 --> 01:16:12.536
So just, you know, know that we're your friends

2163
01:16:12.536 --> 01:16:14.954
and that we're not going to hurt you,

2164
01:16:14.954 --> 01:16:17.439
and that please don't hurt us,

2165
01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:19.093
and don't scream or anything,

2166
01:16:19.093 --> 01:16:23.721
and I think you're bald head looks really cool,

2167
01:16:23.721 --> 01:16:27.878
and you should keep going with that

2168
01:16:27.878 --> 01:16:30.194
because you look really nice and stuff, okay.

2169
01:16:30.194 --> 01:16:31.494
LIAM: Maybe backup a spell?

2170
01:16:31.494 --> 01:16:33.149
TALIESIN: I'm right up there,

2171
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:34.525
I'm fine with that.
MARISHA: I ready an action,

2172
01:16:34.525 --> 01:16:35.855
just in case.
MATT: Okay.

2173
01:16:35.855 --> 01:16:37.280
SAM: I'm hiding and ready an action, as well.

2174
01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.885
MATT: Make a persuasion check, Jester.

2175
01:16:38.885 --> 01:16:40.167
LAURA: Oh no.
TALIESIN: It's okay.

2176
01:16:40.167 --> 01:16:42.138
LIAM: I am readying a cocoon

2177
01:16:42.138 --> 01:16:43.796
for Polymorph, myself.

2178
01:16:43.796 --> 01:16:44.646
LAURA: 11!

2179
01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:46.491
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: I'm going to stand

2180
01:16:46.491 --> 01:16:48.092
next to Jester, just in case.

2181
01:16:48.092 --> 01:16:48.962
MATT: Okay.

2182
01:16:48.962 --> 01:16:52.219
As the two giants are there flanking it,

2183
01:16:52.219 --> 01:16:55.051
and you guys backup and find your place,

2184
01:16:55.051 --> 01:16:56.207
do you release the spell?

2185
01:16:56.207 --> 01:16:59.200
LAURA: I hold up my traveler and I go (vocalizing),

2186
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.033
okay.

2187
01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:02.258
MATT: (laughs)

2188
01:17:02.258 --> 01:17:04.354
(Ashley imitating Laura)

2189
01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:07.287
MATT: The form shifts back into the Stone Giant.

2190
01:17:08.729 --> 01:17:12.387
You see as the female giant is now

2191
01:17:12.387 --> 01:17:15.262
resting on the ground. Looks at the rest of you and

2192
01:17:15.262 --> 01:17:17.202
immediately instinctually flinches a bit.

2193
01:17:17.202 --> 01:17:20.428
The body tenses, the staff is placed hard on the ground,

2194
01:17:20.428 --> 01:17:23.238
to get up off of where she was sitting.

2195
01:17:24.205 --> 01:17:25.982
She stands up to loom over you

2196
01:17:25.982 --> 01:17:27.642
and it's now the three shoulder-to-shoulder.

2197
01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:30.182
She looks to the other two.

2198
01:17:30.182 --> 01:17:31.723
"(sighs)

2199
01:17:37.147 --> 01:17:42.147
"If you mean to help, then show us.

2200
01:17:43.086 --> 01:17:46.462
"But we do not trust the word of outsiders.

2201
01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:48.266
"We trust the actions."
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2202
01:17:48.266 --> 01:17:51.660
TALIESIN: I mean--
LAURA: Can she speak Common,

2203
01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.949
or is she still speaking--?
MATT: She's speaking Giant.

2204
01:17:52.949 --> 01:17:54.463
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay, cool.

2205
01:17:54.463 --> 01:17:56.128
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, that's very fair,

2206
01:17:56.128 --> 01:17:57.513
although I should point out that

2207
01:17:57.513 --> 01:18:00.048
this could have ended a lot of different ways,

2208
01:18:00.048 --> 01:18:03.098
and I would hope that you take that into account.

2209
01:18:05.029 --> 01:18:06.056
It could have been to the death,

2210
01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:07.320
and I think that would have been a waste

2211
01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.568
on everybody's end, either way.

2212
01:18:11.568 --> 01:18:13.341
MATT: "Your tricks keep us docile,

2213
01:18:13.341 --> 01:18:14.622
"but strength against strength,

2214
01:18:14.622 --> 01:18:16.601
"you would still be smashed."

2215
01:18:16.601 --> 01:18:19.114
TALIESIN: Strength against strength. That's fair.

2216
01:18:19.114 --> 01:18:21.848
So--
TRAVIS: Jesus.

2217
01:18:21.848 --> 01:18:23.277
TALIESIN: Tell me about what drove you from your home,

2218
01:18:23.277 --> 01:18:25.323
if you don't mind.

2219
01:18:25.323 --> 01:18:26.342
If we have a minute,

2220
01:18:26.342 --> 01:18:28.187
when everything is said and done,

2221
01:18:28.187 --> 01:18:30.391
I will help heal you and your friends.

2222
01:18:30.391 --> 01:18:34.058
MATT: You see a thousand yard stare from Soorna.

2223
01:18:36.005 --> 01:18:37.217
LAURA: Sorry. Excuse me.

2224
01:18:37.217 --> 01:18:38.687
MATT: That's okay.

2225
01:18:38.687 --> 01:18:40.256
TALIESIN: I relay this all to everybody.

2226
01:18:40.256 --> 01:18:42.556
MATT: She begins to say,

2227
01:18:42.556 --> 01:18:45.679
"As they said, it was the hum."

2228
01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:47.740
TALIESIN: The hum?
MATT: "The droning,

2229
01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:50.240
"through the halls of our Braan.

2230
01:18:52.299 --> 01:18:56.987
"The creatures buzzing and flying.

2231
01:18:56.987 --> 01:18:58.758
"Piercing our friends,

2232
01:18:58.758 --> 01:19:02.611
"siphoning away their spirits and life. They wither."

2233
01:19:02.611 --> 01:19:03.577
TALIESIN: (whistles)

2234
01:19:05.369 --> 01:19:07.615
MATT: "At first, before all of this,

2235
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:11.523
"we didn't know where the smell was coming,

2236
01:19:12.555 --> 01:19:16.888
"but from the bone pit, a strange...

2237
01:19:19.181 --> 01:19:21.539
"a strange glow was discovered

2238
01:19:21.539 --> 01:19:23.271
"by Oombad, my brother."

2239
01:19:25.487 --> 01:19:27.120
MARISHA: Strange glow.

2240
01:19:28.414 --> 01:19:30.446
MATT: "We didn't think anything of it,

2241
01:19:31.579 --> 01:19:34.912
"until the small nightmares began to hum.

2242
01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:40.339
"We tried to fight, but our clubs and rocks

2243
01:19:40.339 --> 01:19:44.931
"glanced off of their beastly horn hides and

"I know better than to know

2245
01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:52.273
"that something small does not make it not dangerous."

2246
01:19:52.273 --> 01:19:54.006
TALIESIN: That's very wise.

2247
01:19:56.823 --> 01:20:00.289
MATT: "When they pierced my brother and pulled the life

2248
01:20:00.289 --> 01:20:03.562
"from his veins, I gave the command to flee.

2249
01:20:05.936 --> 01:20:10.349
"We regrouped and lost two more as we exited the cave.

2250
01:20:10.349 --> 01:20:12.682
"It was just the eight of us.

2251
01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:15.920
"After we had some time to collect our thoughts

2252
01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.966
"and prepare to return, we walked back

2253
01:20:18.966 --> 01:20:23.091
"to the front of Braan,

2254
01:20:25.367 --> 01:20:28.867
"and there I saw my brother waiting, Oombad.

2255
01:20:29.736 --> 01:20:34.378
"He who I saw die before me, just smiled back,

2256
01:20:35.389 --> 01:20:37.064
"and I knew it wasn't him."

2257
01:20:37.064 --> 01:20:38.218
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2258
01:20:38.218 --> 01:20:39.365
TALIESIN: Oh no.
MATT: "And I knew

2259
01:20:39.365 --> 01:20:41.415
"we could not go back.

2260
01:20:43.467 --> 01:20:47.384
"They began to give chase once more, and we ran.

2261
01:20:48.365 --> 01:20:51.257
"We ran from the mountain, we ran through the woods,

2262
01:20:51.257 --> 01:20:54.347
"and we ran into this encampment.

2263
01:20:55.772 --> 01:20:59.230
"Then, people here fought back,

2264
01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:03.589
"angry and cut and we protected ourselves.

2265
01:21:05.226 --> 01:21:09.386
"Many of us wounded, but we survived and they fled.

2266
01:21:09.386 --> 01:21:12.443
"We decided to make this camp ours.

2267
01:21:12.443 --> 01:21:16.972
"If the things that took our home were to pursue,

2268
01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:20.312
"this would be where we make our stand.

2269
01:21:20.312 --> 01:21:23.281
"If not, we would rebuild.

2270
01:21:23.281 --> 01:21:26.155
"But if what you say is true

2271
01:21:26.155 --> 01:21:29.313
"and you have interest in helping us reclaim our home,

2272
01:21:29.313 --> 01:21:32.988
"and you do, then we have no use

2273
01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:35.571
"of this place for small people.

2274
01:21:36.576 --> 01:21:38.206
TALIESIN: We serve life.

2275
01:21:38.206 --> 01:21:39.938
The things you describe are

2276
01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:43.021
quite literally the opposite of that.

2277
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.590
We have an enemy in common.

2278
01:21:48.738 --> 01:21:50.844
Your plan was very sound to stay here

2279
01:21:50.844 --> 01:21:52.761
and hold a final stand.

2280
01:21:55.684 --> 01:21:57.748
Perhaps together we can do something

2281
01:21:57.748 --> 01:22:00.322
about these people who have taken your home.

2282
01:22:01.422 --> 01:22:02.641
How small were they?

2283
01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:03.974
Smaller than us?

2284
01:22:05.874 --> 01:22:07.888
MATT: She puts her hands forward

2285
01:22:07.888 --> 01:22:12.218
and she says, "Different sizes.

2286
01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:15.100
"The ones that fly, and she makes like a ball shape

2287
01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.707
with her hands that's about twice the size of Caduceus.

2288
01:22:18.707 --> 01:22:20.001
SAM: Oh, that's pretty big.

2289
01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:22.198
MATT: It's pretty big.
TALIESIN: That's pretty big.

2290
01:22:22.198 --> 01:22:24.145
MARISHA: Twice the size of Caduceus?

2291
01:22:24.145 --> 01:22:27.108
MATT: "There were smaller, thinner ones with tails

2292
01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:31.273
"and a hooked horn. They feasted on the corpses."

2293
01:22:31.273 --> 01:22:32.523
TALIESIN: Yeah, oh boy.

2294
01:22:35.988 --> 01:22:37.744
MARISHA: Horns, scales?

2295
01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.767
Sounds like undead demon shit.

2296
01:22:39.767 --> 01:22:41.769
LAURA: Undead demons?

2297
01:22:41.769 --> 01:22:43.353
SAM: One of the giants was killed

2298
01:22:43.353 --> 01:22:45.222
and brought back to life as a zombie.

2299
01:22:45.222 --> 01:22:46.055
LAURA: Oh no.

2300
01:22:47.198 --> 01:22:49.281
TALIESIN: That's--

2301
01:22:50.762 --> 01:22:51.595
MARISHA: Hm.

2302
01:22:51.595 --> 01:22:54.320
SAM: Caduceus, have you asked them if they wouldn't mind

2303
01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:57.559
just living somewhere else?

2304
01:22:57.559 --> 01:22:59.344
TALIESIN: No, I haven't.

2305
01:22:59.344 --> 01:23:00.725
SAM: Do you think they would?

2306
01:23:00.725 --> 01:23:01.975
TALIESIN: I don't know.

2307
01:23:02.992 --> 01:23:04.210
SAM: Or do we have to really?

2308
01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:05.702
We have to go back with them and help?

2309
01:23:05.702 --> 01:23:08.852
ASHLEY: Yeah, but then they still don't have a home.

2310
01:23:08.852 --> 01:23:11.759
SAM: Well, shit.
TALIESIN: It's also possible.

2311
01:23:11.759 --> 01:23:14.896
How long have they been here for?

2312
01:23:14.896 --> 01:23:18.396
How long ago did you make your way here?

2313
01:23:20.112 --> 01:23:21.960
MATT: "It's eight sun cycles."

2314
01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.135
TALIESIN: They still haven't found you yet, these things?

2315
01:23:28.332 --> 01:23:29.165
Well.

2316
01:23:30.823 --> 01:23:33.718
SAM: We'll have them on our side if we go back, right,

2317
01:23:33.718 --> 01:23:37.392
to fight these undead creature-y things?

2318
01:23:37.392 --> 01:23:40.200
TALIESIN: If they are feeling that is

2319
01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.168
the correct course of action.

2320
01:23:43.168 --> 01:23:44.565
TRAVIS: Or if they don't want to join us,

2321
01:23:44.565 --> 01:23:47.546
we take a little rest, their hunting party comes back,

2322
01:23:47.546 --> 01:23:50.049
does not smash us.
TALIESIN:: That would be nice.

2323
01:23:50.049 --> 01:23:53.849
TRAVIS: Then we could go try and play exterminator.

2324
01:23:53.849 --> 01:23:55.791
MARISHA: I mean any type of invasion

2325
01:23:55.791 --> 01:23:57.574
is only going to get worse, right?

2326
01:23:57.574 --> 01:24:01.336
TALIESIN: I don't like these things walking the land.

2327
01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:03.863
That does not sit well with me.

2328
01:24:03.863 --> 01:24:05.980
MARISHA: Plus, it's either work for these guys

2329
01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:10.312
or work for some sort of Xhorhasian bureaucrats.

2330
01:24:10.312 --> 01:24:15.312
LIAM: Yeah, we are still measuring what we want to do here.

2331
01:24:15.325 --> 01:24:17.400
TALIESIN: And we serve ourselves.

2332
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.900
LIAM: Is this what you want to do?

2333
01:24:21.197 --> 01:24:26.197
TALIESIN: I have some fear, but this feels

2334
01:24:26.988 --> 01:24:28.479
noble.

2335
01:24:28.479 --> 01:24:32.400
MARISHA: Caduceus, what are you looking for again?

2336
01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.371
Does this have any play in that?

2337
01:24:35.371 --> 01:24:37.757
TALIESIN: I don't know, but probably.

2338
01:24:37.757 --> 01:24:39.534
MARISHA: That was very clear of you.

2339
01:24:39.534 --> 01:24:40.534
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2340
01:24:41.416 --> 01:24:42.333
TRAVIS: Probably?

2341
01:24:43.941 --> 01:24:46.147
TALIESIN: I am looking for answers,

2342
01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:49.552
and the fact that something like this is out there

2343
01:24:49.552 --> 01:24:53.394
is definitely a--feels important.

2344
01:24:54.626 --> 01:24:56.613
We've been brought here.

2345
01:24:56.613 --> 01:25:00.196
We've been presented with this opportunity.

2346
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:03.113
That seems special.

2347
01:25:05.361 --> 01:25:07.725
It seems particular.

2348
01:25:07.725 --> 01:25:10.520
TRAVIS: Let's do it. Come on.

2349
01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.742
TALIESIN: I'm surprised, but thank you.

2350
01:25:12.742 --> 01:25:14.350
MARISHA: Why?

2351
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:17.077
TALIESIN: Fjord is, Mister Fjord is normally what I'd

2352
01:25:17.077 --> 01:25:19.926
consider to be the voice of caution.

2353
01:25:20.876 --> 01:25:23.275
LIAM: I think we are doing something more dangerous

2354
01:25:23.275 --> 01:25:25.259
than what we have in front of us.

2355
01:25:25.259 --> 01:25:26.801
We could probably exterminate the giants here.

2356
01:25:26.801 --> 01:25:31.226
TALIESIN: We are definitely trading up to a bigger fish,

2357
01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:32.068
so to speak.

2358
01:25:32.068 --> 01:25:33.606
MARISHA: Well, just because it's

2359
01:25:33.606 --> 01:25:36.460
the easiest route, doesn't mean it's the best one, though.

2360
01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:38.226
TRAVIS: There's also eight more coming back.

2361
01:25:38.226 --> 01:25:40.330
LIAM: Yeah, but we could--
SAM: Five.

2362
01:25:40.330 --> 01:25:41.993
LIAM: I'm not saying--correct.

2363
01:25:41.993 --> 01:25:43.211
That's not what we're going to do,

2364
01:25:43.211 --> 01:25:45.285
but we could, we could deal

2365
01:25:45.285 --> 01:25:47.397
with these things easily, I believe. But...

2366
01:25:50.697 --> 01:25:53.872
If we need, the goal here was to empty out this fort.

2367
01:25:53.872 --> 01:25:55.410
We're going to do it one way or another.

2368
01:25:55.410 --> 01:25:58.022
We are going to walk with our new friends

2369
01:25:58.022 --> 01:25:59.742
to this problem and deal with it,

2370
01:25:59.742 --> 01:26:01.124
or if it's too much for us,

2371
01:26:01.124 --> 01:26:05.017
we can also fall back and leave them, leave them.

2372
01:26:05.017 --> 01:26:06.679
MARISHA: Do we think Waccoh--?

2373
01:26:06.679 --> 01:26:08.987
You think Waccoh would accept

2374
01:26:08.987 --> 01:26:13.178
proof of the situation

2375
01:26:13.178 --> 01:26:16.918
being handled other than the head of a giant?

2376
01:26:16.918 --> 01:26:19.104
SAM: If this smelting operation

2377
01:26:19.104 --> 01:26:22.393
starts up again, then, he'll be happy.

2378
01:26:22.393 --> 01:26:23.326
TALIESIN: We can even tell him that

2379
01:26:23.326 --> 01:26:24.756
there were barely any giants there

2380
01:26:24.756 --> 01:26:26.405
and they ran away immediately

2381
01:26:26.405 --> 01:26:27.673
at the first sign of people.

2382
01:26:27.673 --> 01:26:28.936
It was barely anything.

2383
01:26:28.936 --> 01:26:30.752
LIAM: This fort being empty would be

2384
01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:32.288
the proof that they require.

2385
01:26:32.288 --> 01:26:34.016
SAM: Have we healed these giants yet?

2386
01:26:34.016 --> 01:26:35.495
Maybe that would be a show of good faith?

2387
01:26:35.495 --> 01:26:36.538
TALIESIN: I have been waiting

2388
01:26:36.538 --> 01:26:38.292
for everybody to--
SAM: Let's do that,

2389
01:26:38.292 --> 01:26:40.481
and then we'll wait for their hunting party

2390
01:26:40.481 --> 01:26:42.660
to get back.
TALIESIN: Who needs healing?

2391
01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:44.506
SAM: All of them need healing, right?

2392
01:26:44.506 --> 01:26:45.821
TALIESIN: I mean who of us, as well.

2393
01:26:45.821 --> 01:26:46.724
SAM: Oh, of us?
MARISHA: I'm good.

2394
01:26:46.724 --> 01:26:50.348
Yeah, I'm a little down, but not a lot.

2395
01:26:50.348 --> 01:26:53.698
TALIESIN: I'm going to relay a little bit of this to her.

2396
01:26:55.115 --> 01:26:56.493
Here's what we're thinking of doing

2397
01:26:56.493 --> 01:26:58.320
is staying the night waiting

2398
01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.189
for the rest of your party to return.

2399
01:27:00.189 --> 01:27:02.110
If you're amiable, having a conversation

2400
01:27:02.110 --> 01:27:05.461
about all of us going, which would be preferable.

2401
01:27:05.461 --> 01:27:08.952
Or we can go and take a look and at least scout

2402
01:27:08.952 --> 01:27:10.462
and see what this is,

2403
01:27:10.462 --> 01:27:14.111
but we feel like together we maybe could help you

2404
01:27:14.111 --> 01:27:14.944
get your home back.

2405
01:27:14.944 --> 01:27:16.490
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2406
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:17.981
TALIESIN: It's going to be a terrible roll, isn't it?

2407
01:27:17.981 --> 01:27:19.253
LIAM: No, it's not.

2408
01:27:19.253 --> 01:27:20.086
MARISHA: Big money.

2409
01:27:20.086 --> 01:27:22.399
TALIESIN: That's terrib--that's 19. That's not--okay.

2410
01:27:22.399 --> 01:27:24.265
LAURA: That's pretty--
LIAM: Not so bad.

2411
01:27:24.265 --> 01:27:26.108
MATT: 19.

2412
01:27:26.108 --> 01:27:28.114
Soorna looking down at you.

2413
01:27:28.114 --> 01:27:33.056
For the first time, you see the scowl fade a moment

2414
01:27:33.056 --> 01:27:36.314
and the chin turn up a bit, surprised.

2415
01:27:39.185 --> 01:27:40.643
"We cannot abandon this,

2416
01:27:40.643 --> 01:27:45.560
"for the moment we do, those people return and take it back.

2417
01:27:46.577 --> 01:27:49.505
"I will go with you, the rest will stay."

2418
01:27:49.505 --> 01:27:50.654
SAM: Hm.

2419
01:27:50.654 --> 01:27:52.532
TALIESIN: Not one friend of yours, as well?

2420
01:27:52.532 --> 01:27:53.365
Just you?

2421
01:27:54.221 --> 01:27:56.334
MATT: "I'll talk to the rest when they return, but

2422
01:27:59.576 --> 01:28:00.909
"I trust you.

2423
01:28:02.273 --> 01:28:05.395
"I don't know if I trust them,

2424
01:28:05.395 --> 01:28:07.188
"and I definitely don't trust them."

2425
01:28:07.188 --> 01:28:09.710
You watch her head peer back towards the east

2426
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:12.779
where the fleeing members of this camp--

2427
01:28:12.779 --> 01:28:15.501
TALIESIN: You are very wise for a giant,

2428
01:28:15.501 --> 01:28:17.093
if that's your feelings.

2429
01:28:17.093 --> 01:28:19.359
MATT: "That's why I am the land speaker of them."

2430
01:28:19.359 --> 01:28:20.908
TALIESIN: The land speaker?

2431
01:28:20.908 --> 01:28:22.336
That's fantastic.

2432
01:28:22.336 --> 01:28:25.944
I'm going to relay, she's game.

2433
01:28:25.944 --> 01:28:28.246
Maybe we can convince one more to come with us,

2434
01:28:28.246 --> 01:28:30.380
but they are hesitant to abandon the fort.

2435
01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:31.533
SAM: They're going to stay here?

2436
01:28:31.533 --> 01:28:33.713
TALIESIN: The rest are hesitant to abandon the fort to just

2437
01:28:33.713 --> 01:28:35.124
be taken back until we--
SAM: Okay, well that's fine.

2438
01:28:35.124 --> 01:28:36.940
LIAM: It's decent.
SAM: Two giants on our side

2439
01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:37.773
is pretty good.

2440
01:28:37.773 --> 01:28:38.606
TALIESIN: I feel good about that.

2441
01:28:38.606 --> 01:28:40.482
One or two, we'll see how they feel.

2442
01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:41.781
I'm going to heal everybody

2443
01:28:41.781 --> 01:28:44.001
really quickly, so I'm going to do a--

2444
01:28:44.001 --> 01:28:46.249
MARISHA: I'd say make sure they don't--

2445
01:28:46.249 --> 01:28:49.865
they can't hurt anybody while we're gone.

2446
01:28:49.865 --> 01:28:50.915
TALIESIN: Try not to.

2447
01:28:50.915 --> 01:28:51.995
MARISHA: Try not to.

2448
01:28:51.995 --> 01:28:54.091
TALIESIN: If they attack, obviously, there's nothing.

2449
01:28:54.091 --> 01:28:55.404
I mean I'm not going to tell people

2450
01:28:55.404 --> 01:28:56.669
not to defend themselves.

2451
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:58.949
MARISHA: You're not wrong, you're not wrong.

2452
01:28:58.949 --> 01:29:00.449
TALIESIN: Let's do a--

2453
01:29:01.668 --> 01:29:03.202
do I want to burn my fifth?

2454
01:29:03.202 --> 01:29:05.128
Let's burn a fourth, that's a little crazy.

2455
01:29:06.378 --> 01:29:09.153
Let's do a Mass Healing Word to--

2456
01:29:09.153 --> 01:29:10.611
or a Prayer of Healing.

2457
01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:14.603
Let's do a ten minute Prayer of Healing for everybody here.

2458
01:29:14.603 --> 01:29:19.603
That's the three of you, you are in there,

2459
01:29:19.747 --> 01:29:21.556
who else needs a little bit of...?

2460
01:29:22.756 --> 01:29:23.589
TRAVIS: I got hit a little bit.

2461
01:29:23.589 --> 01:29:25.413
SAM: We're also taking a short rest, yeah?

2462
01:29:25.413 --> 01:29:26.246
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2463
01:29:26.246 --> 01:29:28.101
This will at least get everybody up and running.

2464
01:29:28.101 --> 01:29:29.896
That's--
LIAM: Are we doing a short

2465
01:29:29.896 --> 01:29:31.725
rest or are we bedding down for the night?

2466
01:29:31.725 --> 01:29:33.912
TALIESIN: We're going to probably bed down for the night.

2467
01:29:33.912 --> 01:29:35.313
LIAM: Yeah, but we want them to talk.

2468
01:29:35.313 --> 01:29:37.053
TALIESIN: We'll have a meal. We'll talk.

2469
01:29:37.053 --> 01:29:38.553
SAM: What time is it?

2470
01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:41.617
LIAM: Well, Sam, it's--

2471
01:29:41.617 --> 01:29:43.963
what time is it?
MATT: Right now?

2472
01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:46.060
LIAM: In the day.
MATT: Oh, in the day.

2473
01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.466
I was like, you can look at your phone.

2474
01:29:47.466 --> 01:29:48.849
TRAVIS: What time is it?

2475
01:29:48.849 --> 01:29:50.349
ALL: Showtime!

2476
01:29:51.749 --> 01:29:55.175
MATT: I get a whole different response to that question.

2477
01:29:55.175 --> 01:29:57.292
This time of day--
LIAM: I wasn't going to go there.

2478
01:29:57.292 --> 01:29:58.125
MATT: I know, I know.

2479
01:29:58.125 --> 01:29:59.544
I don't know if you would.

2480
01:29:59.544 --> 01:30:02.544
It would, I'd say at this point it's

2481
01:30:03.545 --> 01:30:06.593
let's say mid-afternoon by the time you guys

2482
01:30:06.593 --> 01:30:08.300
have traveled through the forest, prepared for this battle,

2483
01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:10.027
and taken the time to settle them,

2484
01:30:10.027 --> 01:30:11.811
it's like four or five o'clock in the afternoon.

2485
01:30:11.811 --> 01:30:12.644
You're looking at dusk in the next--

2486
01:30:12.644 --> 01:30:15.130
TALIESIN: 26 points.
MATT: Hour or two.

2487
01:30:15.130 --> 01:30:17.993
SAM: Oh hey, Caduceus, one more question.

2488
01:30:17.993 --> 01:30:19.006
TALIESIN: Yeah, of course.

2489
01:30:19.006 --> 01:30:20.645
SAM: How far is it walk to their camp?

2490
01:30:20.645 --> 01:30:21.847
TRAVIS: Nott, why is your voice so low?

2491
01:30:21.847 --> 01:30:25.354
SAM: I don't know, why is it? How far is the--?

2492
01:30:25.354 --> 01:30:27.520
TALIESIN: Here you go, Nott. There you go, right there.

2493
01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:31.330
SAM: How far is it to their camp by foot?

2494
01:30:31.330 --> 01:30:32.750
TALIESIN: How long of a walk would you say that we,

2495
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:34.967
after we bed down the night,

2496
01:30:34.967 --> 01:30:39.008
what do you expect our walk to be?

2497
01:30:39.008 --> 01:30:40.183
MATT: She looks up,

2498
01:30:40.183 --> 01:30:42.398
from her perspective, she stands up

2499
01:30:42.398 --> 01:30:45.003
and she can see, the rest of you see the trees

2500
01:30:45.003 --> 01:30:46.514
are too thick and too tall.

2501
01:30:46.514 --> 01:30:49.314
She glances up.

2502
01:30:49.314 --> 01:30:52.638
"It's about a three hour journey at your speed."

2503
01:30:52.638 --> 01:30:54.529
TALIESIN: That's not bad.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

2504
01:30:54.529 --> 01:30:56.494
TRAVIS: Can we check the rest of the camp,

2505
01:30:56.494 --> 01:31:00.289
that abode over there, that tent, just to make sure

2506
01:31:00.289 --> 01:31:02.800
nobody had any, you know (mumbling).

2507
01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:03.853
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2508
01:31:03.853 --> 01:31:05.641
TALIESIN: Oh, let's find what's his name's tent.

2509
01:31:05.641 --> 01:31:06.997
MATT: Whoever wants to help with that,

2510
01:31:06.997 --> 01:31:07.830
or you can--

2511
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:08.830
TALIESIN: --and see if there's any incriminating evidence.

2512
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:09.663
SAM: Oh yeah, what is his name?

2513
01:31:09.663 --> 01:31:10.872
The guy we're supposed to embarrass?

2514
01:31:10.872 --> 01:31:12.203
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2515
01:31:12.203 --> 01:31:13.211
MATT: A natural 20, a total of?

2516
01:31:13.211 --> 01:31:16.129
TRAVIS: 26.

2517
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:19.130
MATT: Nice! Damn, boy!

2518
01:31:19.130 --> 01:31:22.380
TALIESIN: Find something embarrassing.

2519
01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:24.114
MATT: As you're rummaging through,

2520
01:31:24.114 --> 01:31:27.102
once again, a lot of materials, errant weapons and such,

2521
01:31:27.102 --> 01:31:31.835
you do find in one of these major towers

2522
01:31:31.835 --> 01:31:35.138
that are placed in the center of the Steelworks encampment,

2523
01:31:35.138 --> 01:31:37.821
there is a

2524
01:31:37.821 --> 01:31:41.754
small, hidden trap door.

2525
01:31:41.754 --> 01:31:45.133
Like four foot by three foot that's underneath

2526
01:31:45.133 --> 01:31:46.596
a little carpeted are there.

2527
01:31:46.596 --> 01:31:48.130
The carpet got tossed a bit,

2528
01:31:48.130 --> 01:31:50.497
you can see the corner, and you're like, huh?

2529
01:31:50.497 --> 01:31:51.746
You open it up, and on the inside

2530
01:31:51.746 --> 01:31:56.443
there is a small box that is locked,

2531
01:31:56.443 --> 01:32:00.966
and a small pouch that contains three glass vials.

2532
01:32:02.672 --> 01:32:03.976
TRAVIS: Nice!

2533
01:32:03.976 --> 01:32:07.264
I'll take the pouch and the box out to the others.

2534
01:32:07.264 --> 01:32:08.969
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: I take a short rest.

2535
01:32:08.969 --> 01:32:11.977
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, ooh! What'd you find?

2536
01:32:11.977 --> 01:32:14.044
TRAVIS: Well, there was this little hidden spot

2537
01:32:14.044 --> 01:32:15.060
in the tower over there,

2538
01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:18.768
and there's three vials of something sloshy,

2539
01:32:18.768 --> 01:32:21.218
and this box.

2540
01:32:21.218 --> 01:32:24.473
LAURA: Is it locked?

2541
01:32:24.473 --> 01:32:25.729
TRAVIS: Is it locked?

2542
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:26.870
MATT: Box is locked.

2543
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:28.162
TRAVIS: It's locked.

2544
01:32:29.797 --> 01:32:30.772
Get it, Nott.

2545
01:32:30.772 --> 01:32:32.130
SAM: (excited growl)

2546
01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:34.888
MATT: Make a dexterity check with your proficiency modifier.

2547
01:32:34.888 --> 01:32:36.364
LIAM: Yes.
SAM: Oh, terrible.

2548
01:32:36.364 --> 01:32:39.030
LIAM: For you, but as a rogue.
SAM: Just 16.

2549
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:41.593
MATT: Just 16? Does not open.

2550
01:32:41.593 --> 01:32:44.368
It's resistant to your work.

2551
01:32:44.368 --> 01:32:46.523
This is a fairly fine lock.

2552
01:32:46.523 --> 01:32:48.435
SAM: Yasha?
TRAVIS: I was going to say.

2553
01:32:48.435 --> 01:32:51.178
When the fine instruments fail--

2554
01:32:51.178 --> 01:32:53.138
TALIESIN: I'd recommend a spell.

2555
01:32:53.138 --> 01:32:55.140
ASHLEY: Okay, well how do we know it's not going to--

2556
01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.208
SAM: Doesn't matter, crush it, kill it!

2557
01:32:57.208 --> 01:32:59.136
TALIESIN: You--technically?

2558
01:32:59.136 --> 01:33:01.020
LIAM: Is there anything going to explode off of that

2559
01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.369
or poof out a fart or, you know?

2560
01:33:02.369 --> 01:33:03.903
TALIESIN: Yeah, does it look like a--

2561
01:33:03.903 --> 01:33:06.832
SAM: I will check for traps.

2562
01:33:06.832 --> 01:33:08.174
MATT: Make an investigation check

2563
01:33:08.174 --> 01:33:10.304
as you're pouring over it.

2564
01:33:10.304 --> 01:33:12.711
SAM: 16!
MATT: 16.

2565
01:33:12.711 --> 01:33:13.544
MATT: Doesn't appear to be trapped from what you can tell.

2566
01:33:13.544 --> 01:33:14.377
SAM: Kill it, crush it!

2567
01:33:14.377 --> 01:33:17.506
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to take the tip of my sword,

2568
01:33:17.506 --> 01:33:20.195
just where the lock is, so I don't break anything inside it,

2569
01:33:20.195 --> 01:33:21.028
and try to--

2570
01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:23.021
MATT: All right, make a strength check.

2571
01:33:23.021 --> 01:33:24.502
Just roll a d20 and add your strength modifier.

2572
01:33:24.502 --> 01:33:27.110
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Come on, beast mode.

2573
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:28.460
LIAM: Yasha!

2574
01:33:30.234 --> 01:33:32.200
ASHLEY: Oh no.

2575
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.362
A 15.

2576
01:33:33.362 --> 01:33:37.656
MATT: 15, (thunking).

2577
01:33:37.656 --> 01:33:40.189
It's not piercing through. This is a well-made box.

2578
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:41.909
SAM: Get one of our giant friends?

2579
01:33:41.909 --> 01:33:43.294
LIAM: Madame Lavore!

2580
01:33:43.294 --> 01:33:44.942
I pick it up and carry it over.

2581
01:33:44.942 --> 01:33:46.453
Boss, crack this nut.

2582
01:33:46.453 --> 01:33:48.692
LAURA: I mean, if Yasha couldn't do it,

2583
01:33:48.692 --> 01:33:50.291
I probably couldn't do it.

2584
01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.191
ASHLEY: You're very strong, I've seen--

2585
01:33:51.191 --> 01:33:52.901
you've got the muscles.

2586
01:33:52.901 --> 01:33:54.881
LAURA: (groaning)

2587
01:33:54.881 --> 01:33:55.967
MATT: Make a strength check.

2588
01:33:55.967 --> 01:33:56.800
LAURA: Okay.

2589
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.162
SAM: Good god, we're never going to open this box.

2590
01:33:58.162 --> 01:33:58.995
MATT: I know.

2591
01:33:58.995 --> 01:34:00.369
TALIESIN: What's in the box!

2592
01:34:00.369 --> 01:34:01.740
LIAM: Yasha was trying to use finesse.

2593
01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:03.778
Go beast mode.

2594
01:34:03.778 --> 01:34:07.596
LAURA: No. No, I'm really low.

2595
01:34:07.596 --> 01:34:09.135
Oh, but, but, but, but, but,

2596
01:34:09.135 --> 01:34:12.472
what if I use my painting tools?

2597
01:34:12.472 --> 01:34:14.862
I'm going to paint a hole on the lock?

2598
01:34:14.862 --> 01:34:15.695
MARISHA: Oh, that's a good idea.

2599
01:34:15.695 --> 01:34:17.370
MATT: Okay. You use a bit of the paint,

2600
01:34:17.370 --> 01:34:18.592
and you paint a little hole.

2601
01:34:18.592 --> 01:34:19.966
All of a sudden your finger goes through,

2602
01:34:19.966 --> 01:34:21.966
and your finger can reach inside the box.

2603
01:34:21.966 --> 01:34:22.799
MARISHA: Yes!

2604
01:34:22.799 --> 01:34:25.851
MATT: You, click, and you open it up from the inside.

2605
01:34:25.851 --> 01:34:28.883
(cheering)

2606
01:34:28.883 --> 01:34:30.877
You now have a box with a hole in it.

2607
01:34:30.877 --> 01:34:33.693
TALIESIN: That's all it is. A box with a hole in it.

2608
01:34:33.693 --> 01:34:35.599
LAURA: Oh no, that'd be so sad.

2609
01:34:35.599 --> 01:34:39.427
MATT: No, there is a locket of a platinum chain.

2610
01:34:39.427 --> 01:34:42.938
It's decently made, and a folded letter.

2611
01:34:42.938 --> 01:34:45.891
The locket opens up and there's a picture inside.

2612
01:34:45.891 --> 01:34:48.239
LAURA: There is a picture.
SAM: Who is it of?

2613
01:34:48.239 --> 01:34:50.800
MARISHA: I look over her shoulder.

2614
01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.738
MATT: Okay, the letter is not written in Common.

2615
01:34:55.738 --> 01:34:57.807
Do any of you speak Undercommon?

2616
01:34:57.807 --> 01:34:58.948
MARISHA: Fuck!

2617
01:34:58.948 --> 01:35:01.081
LIAM: Give it to me, I will tell you what it says.

2618
01:35:01.081 --> 01:35:05.139
LAURA: It's a love letter. What does the locket have in it?

2619
01:35:05.139 --> 01:35:05.972
TALIESIN: It's a Rick Roll.

2620
01:35:05.972 --> 01:35:10.972
MATT: Inside there is a somewhat debaucherous image

2621
01:35:11.347 --> 01:35:15.331
of a dark elf woman who's barely covered.

2622
01:35:16.463 --> 01:35:20.971
It's been very carefully painted by hand.

2623
01:35:20.971 --> 01:35:22.646
LAURA: Ooh!

2624
01:35:22.646 --> 01:35:24.485
TRAVIS: Never going to give you up.

2625
01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:26.547
Never going to let you down.

2626
01:35:26.547 --> 01:35:28.440
LIAM: Out in my mining fort bunk.

2627
01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.714
Caleb sits on the ground and begins to,

2628
01:35:30.714 --> 01:35:33.048
he pulls out the one book and begins the ritual--

2629
01:35:33.048 --> 01:35:34.466
LAURA: Make sure it's not magical.

2630
01:35:34.466 --> 01:35:36.879
LIAM: (vocalizing) Well, he's doing his thing.

2631
01:35:36.879 --> 01:35:38.061
LAURA: Is it magical, Caleb?

2632
01:35:38.061 --> 01:35:39.844
LIAM: Ten minutes later, he's ignoring Jester.

2633
01:35:39.844 --> 01:35:41.248
SAM: Give him a second!
LAURA: Caleb!

2634
01:35:41.248 --> 01:35:42.276
Caleb, is it magic, though?

2635
01:35:42.276 --> 01:35:43.417
SAM: Give him a second.
LAURA: Is it magic?

2636
01:35:43.417 --> 01:35:45.158
LIAM: I have a very unique brain,

2637
01:35:45.158 --> 01:35:46.199
I can push everyone--

2638
01:35:46.199 --> 01:35:47.757
MARISHA: Jester, read it. Jester, read it.

2639
01:35:47.757 --> 01:35:48.915
Jester, read it.

2640
01:35:48.915 --> 01:35:50.099
LAURA: Jester read what?

2641
01:35:50.099 --> 01:35:51.336
MARISHA: Read the, I want--

2642
01:35:51.336 --> 01:35:52.328
read it out loud.

2643
01:35:52.328 --> 01:35:53.942
LAURA: Well but, I can't understand it.

2644
01:35:53.942 --> 01:35:55.294
MARISHA: Just read it, just read it.

2645
01:35:55.294 --> 01:35:58.043
(laughter)

2646
01:35:58.043 --> 01:36:00.757
MATT: The three giants are right outside going--

2647
01:36:02.432 --> 01:36:03.867
LIAM: Caleb is just like--

2648
01:36:03.867 --> 01:36:05.940
(laughter)

2649
01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:07.887
MARISHA: We're shouting over top of each other.

2650
01:36:07.887 --> 01:36:09.184
MATT: So you're casting--?

2651
01:36:09.184 --> 01:36:10.532
LIAM: Comprehend language.

2652
01:36:10.532 --> 01:36:11.899
MATT: Okay. You can read it.

2653
01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:12.867
LIAM: Yeah, ten minutes later.

2654
01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.237
LAURA: What's it say?
MATT: It reads,

2655
01:36:14.237 --> 01:36:17.615
"My dear, sweet Bodo."

2656
01:36:17.615 --> 01:36:19.455
TRAVIS: Hot stuff.

2657
01:36:19.455 --> 01:36:21.234
MARISHA: It's Bodo!

2658
01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:24.212
We got all the embarrassment shit we need.

2659
01:36:24.212 --> 01:36:25.070
Keep going.

2660
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:26.711
LIAM: Triple the embarrassment.

2661
01:36:27.725 --> 01:36:29.367
MATT: "It is difficult

2662
01:36:29.367 --> 01:36:31.958
"without you at my side these days."

2663
01:36:31.958 --> 01:36:34.418
It goes into a lengthy description of their--

2664
01:36:34.418 --> 01:36:35.326
TRAVIS: Oh no, keep going.

2665
01:36:35.326 --> 01:36:37.202
Don't you "lengthy description" my ass--

2666
01:36:37.202 --> 01:36:38.684
at Their torrid affair and the importance

2667
01:36:38.684 --> 01:36:40.250
of keeping it secret.

2668
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:42.233
(oohing)

2669
01:36:42.233 --> 01:36:43.510
LIAM: How did Bodo like it?

2670
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:47.201
MATT: Bodo seemed to enjoy it.

2671
01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:48.468
TRAVIS: Any way he can.

2672
01:36:48.468 --> 01:36:49.925
LIAM: No, but <i>where</i> did Bodo like it?

2673
01:36:49.925 --> 01:36:51.252
SAM: Oh god.
TRAVIS: Oh. Oh.

2674
01:36:52.819 --> 01:36:54.236
MATT: You learn--

2675
01:36:55.535 --> 01:36:57.071
LAURA: Matt, don't listen to him.

2676
01:36:57.071 --> 01:37:00.089
MATT: --this lascivious union that they've carried on

2677
01:37:00.089 --> 01:37:01.407
for quite some time.

2678
01:37:01.407 --> 01:37:02.569
LIAM: I need specifics, man!

2679
01:37:02.569 --> 01:37:04.149
LAURA: What's the woman's name?

2680
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:05.647
MARISHA: They were into food stuff, weren't they?

2681
01:37:05.647 --> 01:37:06.863
SAM: Yeah, what's it signed?

2682
01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:08.143
MATT: It's just signed as a V, that's all.

2683
01:37:08.143 --> 01:37:09.293
SAM: With a V?
MATT: Yeah.

2684
01:37:09.293 --> 01:37:11.135
There's elements of it that are kept somewhat vague.

2685
01:37:11.135 --> 01:37:12.637
You get the sense

2686
01:37:12.637 --> 01:37:15.271
that this communication is designed to be,

2687
01:37:15.271 --> 01:37:17.854
as much as they can, on the DL.

2688
01:37:18.754 --> 01:37:20.012
LIAM: It's balloon porn.

2689
01:37:20.012 --> 01:37:20.846
<i>Ja</i>, go ahead.

2690
01:37:20.846 --> 01:37:22.211
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2691
01:37:22.211 --> 01:37:23.823
SAM: All right, we've got some evidénce.

2692
01:37:23.823 --> 01:37:25.563
LAURA: Is this magical?

2693
01:37:25.563 --> 01:37:26.902
Is this locket magical?

2694
01:37:26.902 --> 01:37:27.935
Is the locket magical?

2695
01:37:27.935 --> 01:37:29.518
SAM: No, it's a titty picture.

2696
01:37:29.518 --> 01:37:30.947
LIAM: Just in case--well, perhaps it is.

2697
01:37:30.947 --> 01:37:32.474
LAURA: Maybe it's a magic titty picture.

2698
01:37:32.474 --> 01:37:34.025
LIAM: Ritual cast, another ten minutes go by

2699
01:37:34.025 --> 01:37:36.380
with everybody yammering.

2700
01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:38.040
MATT: It is not magical.

2701
01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.538
LIAM: It is.

2702
01:37:39.538 --> 01:37:40.988
LAURA: Sweet! I put it on.

2703
01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:43.399
LIAM: It gives you access to balloon porn.

2704
01:37:43.399 --> 01:37:45.444
SAM: What is balloon porn?

2705
01:37:45.444 --> 01:37:47.341
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no.
TALIESIN: No, no. Why?

2706
01:37:47.341 --> 01:37:48.533
TRAVIS: No.

2707
01:37:48.533 --> 01:37:50.156
TALIESIN: Why? No.

2708
01:37:50.156 --> 01:37:51.845
SAM: I want to know.

2709
01:37:51.845 --> 01:37:52.678
TALIESIN: Drop it.

2710
01:37:52.678 --> 01:37:53.922
MATT: Google will help you later on.

2711
01:37:53.922 --> 01:37:54.755
TRAVIS: Stop it!

2712
01:37:54.755 --> 01:37:56.055
TALIESIN: No, don't encourage this.

2713
01:37:56.055 --> 01:37:57.953
LIAM: The ultimate Comprehend Languages.

2714
01:37:57.953 --> 01:38:00.211
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MARISHA: SEO for balloon porn

2715
01:38:00.211 --> 01:38:02.806
goes up 500%.

2716
01:38:02.806 --> 01:38:04.820
MATT: I don't want to be responsible for that.

2717
01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:06.145
Not kink shame.

2718
01:38:06.145 --> 01:38:09.236
But--(laughs) All right, so,

2719
01:38:10.086 --> 01:38:13.198
another hour of you guys doing this passes.

2720
01:38:13.198 --> 01:38:16.253
The sun begins to--the sky, cloudy as it is,

2721
01:38:16.253 --> 01:38:21.253
begins to turn towards the oranges and reds of sunset

2722
01:38:21.345 --> 01:38:24.836
as you hear a dull horn in the distance

2723
01:38:24.836 --> 01:38:27.197
just blare, and the giants

2724
01:38:27.197 --> 01:38:28.835
look over in that direction,

2725
01:38:28.835 --> 01:38:32.156
and they say to you, "They're returning."

2726
01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:33.612
LAURA: Are we safe? Are we safe?

2727
01:38:33.612 --> 01:38:34.910
MARISHA: Yeah, make sure they don't kill us.

2728
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:36.153
LIAM: Should we duck out?

2729
01:38:36.153 --> 01:38:37.929
LAURA: Should we go in the bubble or something

2730
01:38:37.929 --> 01:38:40.193
so they can't hurt us in case they don't like us?

2731
01:38:40.193 --> 01:38:41.685
LIAM: All right, that takes too much time

2732
01:38:41.685 --> 01:38:42.993
probably at this point.

2733
01:38:42.993 --> 01:38:44.920
SAM: We have the good favor of their leader,

2734
01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:45.913
we'll be fine.

2735
01:38:45.913 --> 01:38:47.156
LIAM: Let's step inside one of these tents

2736
01:38:47.156 --> 01:38:48.281
until they can discuss.

2737
01:38:48.281 --> 01:38:51.140
MATT: Okay, so you guys all dodge inside one of the tents.

2738
01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:53.395
Make a stealth check, all of you who take part in this.

2739
01:38:53.395 --> 01:38:55.637
TALIESIN: Should I stay out as a representative?

2740
01:38:55.637 --> 01:38:57.397
MATT: Have you taken your moorbounders in with you,

2741
01:38:57.397 --> 01:38:58.918
or are they still out in the forest?

2742
01:38:58.918 --> 01:38:59.799
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh.

2743
01:38:59.799 --> 01:39:01.714
TRAVIS: They were out in the trees the last--

2744
01:39:01.714 --> 01:39:02.831
LAURA: We should get them.

2745
01:39:02.831 --> 01:39:03.738
TRAVIS: Let's leave them there.

2746
01:39:03.738 --> 01:39:05.729
LAURA: No, the hunting party is going to see them

2747
01:39:05.729 --> 01:39:06.962
and they're going to hurt them.

2748
01:39:06.962 --> 01:39:09.259
TRAVIS: Leave your animals behind for one stinking minute.

2749
01:39:09.259 --> 01:39:11.035
LAURA: If they get killed, I'm going to kill you.

2750
01:39:11.035 --> 01:39:12.943
TRAVIS: No, you're not, you love me.

2751
01:39:12.943 --> 01:39:14.586
MARISHA: Ooh!

2752
01:39:14.586 --> 01:39:16.096
ASHLEY: Natural 20.
MATT: Nice.

2753
01:39:16.096 --> 01:39:17.204
TALIESIN: Stealth roll?

2754
01:39:19.171 --> 01:39:22.380
That's terrible, that's a one, so that's a two.

2755
01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.784
LAURA: Two zero,

2756
01:39:23.784 --> 01:39:26.381
that's a 20 for me.
MATT: Nice.

2757
01:39:26.381 --> 01:39:27.369
SAM: 30.

2758
01:39:27.369 --> 01:39:29.277
LAURA: Whoa.
LIAM: <i>Vier</i>.

2759
01:39:29.277 --> 01:39:30.767
MARISHA: 15.
TRAVIS: Same.

2760
01:39:30.767 --> 01:39:33.428
MATT: Okay. Interesting spread there.

2761
01:39:34.561 --> 01:39:36.057
You hear the heavy footfalls

2762
01:39:36.057 --> 01:39:37.513
and some conversation happening

2763
01:39:37.513 --> 01:39:40.927
from the other side of the heavy gate

2764
01:39:40.927 --> 01:39:42.393
that bisects this open yard,

2765
01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:43.876
where it leads into the actual mining camp

2766
01:39:43.876 --> 01:39:45.794
that the Steelworks are built around.

2767
01:39:45.794 --> 01:39:48.637
You can see one of the heavy gates swing open

2768
01:39:48.637 --> 01:39:52.785
and five giants come in, all covered in metal plates.

2769
01:39:52.785 --> 01:39:55.849
It's roughshod metal armor,

2770
01:39:55.849 --> 01:39:58.742
it looks like scale mail if you tried to make it

2771
01:39:58.742 --> 01:40:01.129
after somebody described to you what scale mail was.

2772
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:02.437
And you were like,

2773
01:40:02.437 --> 01:40:05.689
"I can make that," and you haphazardly piece it together.

2774
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:07.428
It's not well crafted.

2775
01:40:07.428 --> 01:40:08.692
They're not used to metalwork,

2776
01:40:08.692 --> 01:40:12.359
they're much more of a stone carving people.

2777
01:40:13.713 --> 01:40:15.007
Whatever it is spooked them enough

2778
01:40:15.007 --> 01:40:16.628
to start adopting metal in hopes

2779
01:40:16.628 --> 01:40:18.251
of being a better defense for

2780
01:40:18.251 --> 01:40:19.902
whatever forced them out of their home.

2781
01:40:19.902 --> 01:40:21.561
One of them in particular is--

2782
01:40:21.561 --> 01:40:24.020
well they're all pretty lithe in their bodies.

2783
01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:25.993
One of them appears to be bigger than the rest,

2784
01:40:25.993 --> 01:40:29.316
and it seems to be the one that led the hunting party.

2785
01:40:29.316 --> 01:40:30.934
You can see them as they come

2786
01:40:30.934 --> 01:40:33.935
and they're dragging behind four wolf corpses,

2787
01:40:33.935 --> 01:40:35.235
their heads all smashed.

2788
01:40:35.235 --> 01:40:38.960
Another one is carrying three giant spiders

2789
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:41.412
that have also had the tops of their heads smashed.

2790
01:40:41.412 --> 01:40:42.736
LIAM: Whoa, interesting.

2791
01:40:42.736 --> 01:40:44.286
MATT: They begin throwing a bunch

2792
01:40:44.286 --> 01:40:46.036
of errant furniture into a pile,

2793
01:40:46.036 --> 01:40:47.913
whatever is wood in the vicinity,

2794
01:40:47.913 --> 01:40:52.913
and you watch as Soorna approaches, the leader,

2795
01:40:52.928 --> 01:40:56.095
and raising her hand, causes a flame to

2796
01:40:56.095 --> 01:40:58.073
burn into a bright bonfire.

2797
01:40:58.073 --> 01:41:01.675
They begin to prepare the animals for cooking and eating.

2798
01:41:01.675 --> 01:41:04.672
While this happens, Soorna approaches the heavier one

2799
01:41:04.672 --> 01:41:06.079
and they begin talking.

2800
01:41:06.079 --> 01:41:06.916
They're far enough away,

2801
01:41:06.916 --> 01:41:08.857
they're about 100 feet away from you at this point,

2802
01:41:08.857 --> 01:41:10.232
where you, unless you want to make

2803
01:41:10.232 --> 01:41:11.535
a perception check to listen in?

2804
01:41:11.535 --> 01:41:12.452
TALIESIN: I'll try.

2805
01:41:14.238 --> 01:41:15.364
Let's see what we get.

2806
01:41:15.364 --> 01:41:16.827
Natural 20. That's 29.

2807
01:41:16.827 --> 01:41:18.146
MATT: Holy shit.

2808
01:41:18.146 --> 01:41:19.971
TALIESIN: I am just meta today.

2809
01:41:19.971 --> 01:41:21.888
SAM: (loudly as a giant) We are whispering.

2810
01:41:21.888 --> 01:41:24.105
MATT: Yeah. Even at this distance.

2811
01:41:24.105 --> 01:41:25.726
MARISHA: (as a giant) Does my voice carry?

2812
01:41:25.726 --> 01:41:27.277
MATT: "Shh, keep it down."

2813
01:41:27.277 --> 01:41:29.694
"Okay, no one can hear us now."

2814
01:41:31.190 --> 01:41:35.775
You hear them arguing over the direction to go.

2815
01:41:35.775 --> 01:41:37.415
Soorna is presenting the idea

2816
01:41:37.415 --> 01:41:39.015
of returning and reclaiming,

2817
01:41:39.015 --> 01:41:42.199
the other one is arguing it's a lost cause.

2818
01:41:42.199 --> 01:41:46.116
Let's stay here, take what we can, and rebuild.

2819
01:41:47.681 --> 01:41:49.126
Maybe a few more months,

2820
01:41:49.126 --> 01:41:52.665
and then maybe build somewhere else in the mountains.

2821
01:41:52.665 --> 01:41:55.286
Soorna says, "We don't have the time for that.

2822
01:41:55.286 --> 01:41:57.867
"The people who came here want to come back,"

2823
01:41:57.867 --> 01:42:02.867
also, and begins to say that, "We were attacked."

2824
01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:05.168
He says, "What?

2825
01:42:05.168 --> 01:42:06.907
"Did you kill them?"

2826
01:42:06.907 --> 01:42:08.288
"She says, "No.

2827
01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:11.744
They've presented an option to help us."

2828
01:42:11.744 --> 01:42:14.128
He responds with, "You know you cannot trust

2829
01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:16.878
"folks smaller than your shoulder."

2830
01:42:19.003 --> 01:42:22.195
She goes, "I understand,

2831
01:42:22.195 --> 01:42:26.144
"but who of us claims the leadership here?"

2832
01:42:26.144 --> 01:42:28.099
He gets really tense,

2833
01:42:28.099 --> 01:42:32.607
up into her face, and he stands a good three feet over her.

2834
01:42:32.607 --> 01:42:34.207
SAM: Wish I had some popcorn.

2835
01:42:34.207 --> 01:42:36.067
MATT: There's a moment of tension.

2836
01:42:36.067 --> 01:42:38.045
LAURA: I open my pack, here.

2837
01:42:38.045 --> 01:42:41.309
MATT: He diffuses and goes, "You bring the fire,

2838
01:42:41.309 --> 01:42:44.285
"we bring the muscle, we work together to survive."

2839
01:42:44.285 --> 01:42:46.182
She goes, "Exactly.

2840
01:42:46.182 --> 01:42:48.182
"You remembered my words.

2841
01:42:49.905 --> 01:42:51.768
"They say they wish to help.

2842
01:42:51.768 --> 01:42:53.328
"I will go with them.

2843
01:42:53.328 --> 01:42:55.690
"Do any of you wish to come, as well?"

2844
01:42:55.690 --> 01:42:57.427
He says, "We just returned.

2845
01:42:57.427 --> 01:42:59.747
"We're tired, and to be honest,

2846
01:42:59.747 --> 01:43:02.888
"if you want to trust small folk, you can go.

2847
01:43:02.888 --> 01:43:04.471
"Because if you don't come back,

2848
01:43:04.471 --> 01:43:06.632
"I can lead us to the next stage."

2849
01:43:06.632 --> 01:43:09.193
LIAM: Oh shit.
SAM: No, you can't!

2850
01:43:09.193 --> 01:43:11.469
MATT: She gets tense about it.

2851
01:43:14.336 --> 01:43:16.840
LIAM: Control that [inaudbile].

2852
01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.507
MATT: She goes, "Well, leave them be.

2853
01:43:20.714 --> 01:43:22.954
"Keep your eyes,

2854
01:43:22.954 --> 01:43:26.046
"I trust one of them."

2855
01:43:27.622 --> 01:43:30.235
He nods, and "Where are they?"

2856
01:43:30.235 --> 01:43:32.097
At which point, you hear Soorna's voice ring out

2857
01:43:32.097 --> 01:43:35.511
and says, "You can show yourselves."

2858
01:43:35.511 --> 01:43:37.344
TALIESIN: I'll come out first.

2859
01:43:38.383 --> 01:43:41.199
I'll walk up and,

2860
01:43:43.633 --> 01:43:47.192
I suppose that means a decision has been reached?

2861
01:43:47.192 --> 01:43:49.686
MATT: The one with all of the heavy armor,

2862
01:43:49.686 --> 01:43:52.423
who is taller, goes, "(laughs),

2863
01:43:52.423 --> 01:43:54.463
"You weren't kidding.

2864
01:43:54.463 --> 01:43:58.107
"Well, you are bigger than most small folk."

2865
01:43:58.107 --> 01:43:59.847
TALIESIN: That's what they tell me, thank you.

2866
01:43:59.847 --> 01:44:01.170
TRAVIS: Nott should go out next.

2867
01:44:01.170 --> 01:44:02.745
SAM: Yeah, I'll go out.

2868
01:44:02.745 --> 01:44:06.466
MATT: They are, (laughing) they have

2869
01:44:06.466 --> 01:44:09.716
like a hearty chuckle at the comparison.

2870
01:44:13.276 --> 01:44:18.276
"If any of you turn on Soorna, we will find you."

2871
01:44:18.882 --> 01:44:21.431
TALIESIN: That's fair. There has been enough fighting

2872
01:44:21.431 --> 01:44:23.582
and I think everyone deserves their home,

2873
01:44:23.582 --> 01:44:27.474
and there are people who feel strongly for this place,

2874
01:44:27.474 --> 01:44:29.916
and they will come back and fight for it,

2875
01:44:29.916 --> 01:44:32.492
because it belongs to them.

2876
01:44:32.492 --> 01:44:33.892
So in turn, we will fight for what's yours

2877
01:44:33.892 --> 01:44:35.317
because it belongs to you.

2878
01:44:35.317 --> 01:44:37.239
TRAVIS: Nice.

2879
01:44:37.239 --> 01:44:38.373
MATT: One of the other

2880
01:44:38.373 --> 01:44:40.839
giants there leans into the other ones,

2881
01:44:40.839 --> 01:44:42.989
and is like, "I'm not going back."

2882
01:44:42.989 --> 01:44:47.155
He goes, "We're not going back, they are."

2883
01:44:47.155 --> 01:44:49.731
TALIESIN: The fact that you killed all that

2884
01:44:49.731 --> 01:44:51.251
and are afraid of what's there

2885
01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:55.185
is definitely worrisome.

2886
01:44:55.185 --> 01:44:57.814
MATT: "Indeed. You should be."

2887
01:44:57.814 --> 01:44:59.200
LAURA: Ask how many of their people

2888
01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.381
got killed in the attack.

2889
01:45:01.381 --> 01:45:03.452
Was it just the one or was it multiple?

2890
01:45:03.452 --> 01:45:05.452
TALIESIN: I hope this isn't a sore subject,

2891
01:45:05.452 --> 01:45:08.828
but what were your numbers before the attack?

2892
01:45:08.828 --> 01:45:10.556
MATT: "We were 12."

2893
01:45:10.556 --> 01:45:14.281
TALIESIN: Okay, okay.

2894
01:45:14.281 --> 01:45:16.775
SAM: Four zombie giants.
TALIESIN: I'm sorry.

2895
01:45:16.775 --> 01:45:19.175
LIAM: How high in the sky did these things go?

2896
01:45:19.175 --> 01:45:20.896
TALIESIN: Roughly how high?

2897
01:45:20.896 --> 01:45:22.039
MATT: Which ones?
LIAM: Oh. just the giants.

2898
01:45:22.039 --> 01:45:23.399
How much bigger than Caduceus?

2899
01:45:23.399 --> 01:45:25.134
TALIESIN: Oh, they're like--

2900
01:45:25.134 --> 01:45:28.270
MATT: They're about between 18 to 20 feet tall.

2901
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:30.157
SAM: Oof!
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2902
01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:33.623
I mean you can see.

2903
01:45:37.359 --> 01:45:40.141
SAM: Well, let's get some rest,

2904
01:45:40.141 --> 01:45:42.237
and then we'll go in the morning.

2905
01:45:42.237 --> 01:45:45.718
TALIESIN: We'll go take a look in the morning.

2906
01:45:45.718 --> 01:45:48.091
MATT: Soorna looks back and gives a nod.

2907
01:45:48.091 --> 01:45:50.905
Tends to the fire, they begin to cook the food.

2908
01:45:50.905 --> 01:45:54.738
The smell is, surprisingly tasty smelling,

2909
01:45:54.738 --> 01:45:56.872
especially when it comes to the wolf meat

2910
01:45:56.872 --> 01:45:58.136
and whatever spider meat.

2911
01:45:58.136 --> 01:45:59.773
You've not seen somebody pull spider meat

2912
01:45:59.773 --> 01:46:02.333
from a spider this large and prepare it for eating,

2913
01:46:02.333 --> 01:46:05.213
a uniquely, white type stringy meat

2914
01:46:05.213 --> 01:46:07.693
that are pulled from the inside of the shell.

2915
01:46:07.693 --> 01:46:09.315
LAURA: It looks like mozzarella.

2916
01:46:09.315 --> 01:46:11.175
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

2917
01:46:11.175 --> 01:46:13.197
LIAM: Is there anything left or is it all in the fire?

2918
01:46:13.197 --> 01:46:15.661
MATT: It's all being placed on areas

2919
01:46:15.661 --> 01:46:18.744
right above the fire, not directly into it necessarily.

2920
01:46:18.744 --> 01:46:21.016
You can see they have taken some of the metal pikes

2921
01:46:21.016 --> 01:46:22.857
and weapons and stuff and they've built

2922
01:46:22.857 --> 01:46:24.857
a small lattice to cook on top of.

2923
01:46:24.857 --> 01:46:26.596
They're intelligent giants.

2924
01:46:26.596 --> 01:46:29.465
They're not the dumb hill giants you've encountered before.

2925
01:46:29.465 --> 01:46:30.969
They seem to be at least of average intelligence,

2926
01:46:30.969 --> 01:46:32.852
some of them more.

2927
01:46:32.852 --> 01:46:35.108
Soorna in particular seems to be a little more,

2928
01:46:35.108 --> 01:46:39.253
a little more head driven than maybe the others.

2929
01:46:39.253 --> 01:46:44.253
As food is not offered to you,

2930
01:46:44.303 --> 01:46:45.769
all of them seem to be very intent

2931
01:46:45.769 --> 01:46:48.228
on watching your goings about.

2932
01:46:48.228 --> 01:46:49.449
While they do not make any aggressive actions,

2933
01:46:49.449 --> 01:46:51.369
there isn't a moment that you're traversing

2934
01:46:51.369 --> 01:46:52.805
out in the open that you don't have

2935
01:46:52.805 --> 01:46:54.623
at least six sets of eyes staring at you

2936
01:46:54.623 --> 01:46:57.109
from 15 or more feet above.

2937
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:59.777
LIAM: I pass out boba to the group.

2938
01:46:59.777 --> 01:47:01.097
SAM: Ooh.

2939
01:47:01.097 --> 01:47:04.136
MARISHA: Hm. Do I, based on the descriptions

2940
01:47:04.136 --> 01:47:05.757
that we've got and the studies

2941
01:47:05.757 --> 01:47:08.731
that I have had at the Reserve,

2942
01:47:08.731 --> 01:47:11.167
do any of the descriptions match

2943
01:47:11.167 --> 01:47:14.900
with any demonic creatures or--

2944
01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:16.182
MATT: Make an arcana check.
MARISHA: --devil creatures

2945
01:47:16.182 --> 01:47:17.419
that I would know?

2946
01:47:17.419 --> 01:47:19.212
Arcana.

2947
01:47:19.212 --> 01:47:20.803
MATT: Arcana check for you.

2948
01:47:20.803 --> 01:47:23.268
MARISHA: Yucky, okay.

2949
01:47:23.268 --> 01:47:24.401
LIAM: Roll high, and then we'll know.

2950
01:47:24.401 --> 01:47:27.881
MARISHA: Mm, 17, not bad.

2951
01:47:27.881 --> 01:47:29.972
MATT: I would say you,

2952
01:47:33.695 --> 01:47:37.722
from the way they describe the flying creature,

2953
01:47:37.722 --> 01:47:38.934
the only one that you really got

2954
01:47:38.934 --> 01:47:40.277
a clear description of,

2955
01:47:40.277 --> 01:47:43.402
you've read something about

2956
01:47:43.402 --> 01:47:48.402
a demonic entity known as a chasme.

2957
01:47:50.210 --> 01:47:55.210
All that you know is they are

2958
01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:57.368
generally pretty terrifying.

2959
01:47:57.368 --> 01:48:00.878
They look like massive bloated mosquito,

2960
01:48:00.878 --> 01:48:02.770
bluish in color,

2961
01:48:02.770 --> 01:48:06.795
with weird humanoid type elements

2962
01:48:06.795 --> 01:48:09.851
like hair and other things that protrude from it.

2963
01:48:09.851 --> 01:48:10.684
LAURA: Ew!

2964
01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:12.037
MATT: You don't know much more than that.

2965
01:48:12.037 --> 01:48:13.055
You know you've come across it,

2966
01:48:13.055 --> 01:48:14.190
it's the way they've described it,

2967
01:48:14.190 --> 01:48:15.302
with the proboscis type

2968
01:48:15.302 --> 01:48:18.022
point in the face.
LAURA: Definitely a mullet!

2969
01:48:18.022 --> 01:48:19.688
SAM and TALIESIN: Proboscis.

2970
01:48:19.688 --> 01:48:22.267
TRAVIS: I feel like I owe you money

2971
01:48:22.267 --> 01:48:23.867
for that word.
MATT: They said a long face

2972
01:48:23.867 --> 01:48:26.043
that pierced and siphoned, you're like, "That--

2973
01:48:26.043 --> 01:48:27.446
"I remember the image,"

2974
01:48:27.446 --> 01:48:29.265
and the image in your studies comes to mind,

2975
01:48:29.265 --> 01:48:30.982
and you're like, "Oh, I hope it's not that."

2976
01:48:30.982 --> 01:48:32.557
That's all you remember.

2977
01:48:32.557 --> 01:48:33.798
MARISHA: I hope it's not that.

2978
01:48:33.798 --> 01:48:35.382
TRAVIS: Hope it's not what?

2979
01:48:35.382 --> 01:48:36.877
You were just looking up to the sky,

2980
01:48:36.877 --> 01:48:38.438
or looked like you were counting the stars.

2981
01:48:38.438 --> 01:48:39.659
MARISHA: Oh sorry, I thought I was talking out loud.

2982
01:48:39.659 --> 01:48:41.754
TRAVIS: Nuh-uh.
MARISHA: Yeah, I remember,

2983
01:48:41.754 --> 01:48:43.654
I might have fallen asleep in class,

2984
01:48:43.654 --> 01:48:45.697
or I might have been hung over,

2985
01:48:45.697 --> 01:48:48.337
but I think I remember this time

2986
01:48:48.337 --> 01:48:51.035
that we learned about these demon creatures

2987
01:48:51.035 --> 01:48:53.595
and they were like giant mosquitoes

2988
01:48:53.595 --> 01:48:56.176
with people faces and bad mullets.

2989
01:48:56.176 --> 01:48:57.302
TRAVIS: Are you fucking with us right now?

2990
01:48:57.302 --> 01:48:58.897
MARISHA: No.
LIAM: That is very specific.

2991
01:48:58.897 --> 01:49:02.517
LAURA: Definitely sketching this in my journal.

2992
01:49:02.517 --> 01:49:04.248
MARISHA: Yeah, they were called chasmes.

2993
01:49:04.248 --> 01:49:05.881
LAURA: Chasmes?

2994
01:49:05.881 --> 01:49:10.322
MARISHA: Yeah, the S is a dollar sign according to Liam.

2995
01:49:10.322 --> 01:49:13.875
Yeah, like Kesha, but chasme.

2996
01:49:13.875 --> 01:49:15.919
SAM: They're flying Keshas?

2997
01:49:15.919 --> 01:49:17.986
MARISHA: Flying Keshas.
SAM: Oh my god.

2998
01:49:17.986 --> 01:49:22.772
TRAVIS: Oh my god, we don't stand a chance.

2999
01:49:22.772 --> 01:49:24.293
LIAM: ♪ I buy my own spells! ♪

3000
01:49:24.293 --> 01:49:26.709
(laughter)

3001
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:29.138
MATT: You guys can rest for the evening.

3002
01:49:29.138 --> 01:49:30.174
TRAVIS: Yes.
SAM: Then we're going to go

3003
01:49:30.174 --> 01:49:31.805
in the bubble, I assume?

3004
01:49:31.805 --> 01:49:33.981
LAURA: We probably should, in case they want to stomp us.

3005
01:49:33.981 --> 01:49:35.458
LIAM: Yes, we are not going to let that happen.

3006
01:49:35.458 --> 01:49:36.399
ASHLEY: I wonder if I could ask them

3007
01:49:36.399 --> 01:49:38.674
for some of that spider meat. It's my favorite food.

3008
01:49:38.674 --> 01:49:39.783
TRAVIS: Do it, man.

3009
01:49:39.783 --> 01:49:41.509
LAURA: You've had spider meat before?

3010
01:49:41.509 --> 01:49:42.789
ASHLEY: This is like a little bit of home.

3011
01:49:42.789 --> 01:49:47.398
SAM: Go ask them. You can use gestures to communicate.

3012
01:49:47.398 --> 01:49:49.048
TALIESIN: You can use Jester to communicate.

3013
01:49:49.048 --> 01:49:51.108
LAURA: That's me!
ASHLEY: Okay.

3014
01:49:51.108 --> 01:49:52.197
MATT: As you guys are all bedding up,

3015
01:49:52.197 --> 01:49:53.521
you head over to the bonfire?

3016
01:49:53.521 --> 01:49:54.401
ASHLEY: I'm going to head over to the bonfire.

3017
01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:55.681
LIAM: I'm making the bubble while she does that.

3018
01:49:55.681 --> 01:49:57.837
MATT: Okay, so as you guys are preparing for dinner,

3019
01:49:57.837 --> 01:50:01.150
or for the evening and bed down,

3020
01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:03.329
the dark sky overhead, no stars above,

3021
01:50:03.329 --> 01:50:06.147
the clouds that largely cover Xhorhas, for the most part,

3022
01:50:06.147 --> 01:50:07.547
which you're very familiar with, are above.

3023
01:50:07.547 --> 01:50:09.622
It's a bit of a clearing here in the middle of the forest

3024
01:50:09.622 --> 01:50:13.169
of the Vermaloc, as you step through the barrier

3025
01:50:13.169 --> 01:50:15.046
of the two areas, the gate's open.

3026
01:50:15.046 --> 01:50:17.307
You can see the big burning bonfire,

3027
01:50:17.307 --> 01:50:21.105
it's probably 15 feet on any given side

3028
01:50:21.105 --> 01:50:23.105
and it's burning up 30 feet in the air,

3029
01:50:23.105 --> 01:50:26.354
and you can see ashes and cinders floating up.

3030
01:50:26.354 --> 01:50:31.102
You can see not all of the giants, five of them are still

3031
01:50:31.102 --> 01:50:32.471
sitting around the fire.

3032
01:50:32.471 --> 01:50:34.113
They're conversing and having conversations

3033
01:50:34.113 --> 01:50:36.466
and they're pulling off meat and eating it.

3034
01:50:36.466 --> 01:50:38.571
As you approach, they all stop talking

3035
01:50:38.571 --> 01:50:39.506
and look over towards you,

3036
01:50:39.506 --> 01:50:41.547
all eyes on you as you step up towards the fire,

3037
01:50:41.547 --> 01:50:45.130
taking your place among the circle.

3038
01:50:48.471 --> 01:50:50.465
ASHLEY: Can I have some of this?

3039
01:50:50.465 --> 01:50:52.390
MATT: They all look at each other.

3040
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:55.227
(laughing)

3041
01:50:55.227 --> 01:50:56.673
They gesture towards it.

3042
01:50:56.673 --> 01:50:59.137
ASHLEY: I pull off the juiciest leg.

3043
01:50:59.137 --> 01:51:00.850
MATT: Okay, it's partially in the fire.

3044
01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:02.614
You actually like reach into the flame for a minute,

3045
01:51:02.614 --> 01:51:04.657
and pull it off.

3046
01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:07.035
It snaps and part of it dangles a little bit

3047
01:51:07.035 --> 01:51:08.626
as you pull it out, and they all begin to lean in.

3048
01:51:08.626 --> 01:51:09.746
ASHLEY: My mouth starts to water.

3049
01:51:09.746 --> 01:51:11.607
MATT: They all lean in to watch.

3050
01:51:11.607 --> 01:51:12.967
ASHLEY: I've missed this.

3051
01:51:12.967 --> 01:51:16.179
(juicy meat squelching)

3052
01:51:16.179 --> 01:51:17.922
MATT: It's been a while, and it is delicious.

3053
01:51:17.922 --> 01:51:19.592
ALL: ♪ It's been a while ♪

3054
01:51:19.592 --> 01:51:22.103
MATT: I hate you all so much.

3055
01:51:22.103 --> 01:51:25.787
(laughter)
I hate you all so much.

3056
01:51:25.787 --> 01:51:27.453
TALIESIN: Been sitting on that.

3057
01:51:28.761 --> 01:51:30.278
SAM: That's your write-off for two months.

3058
01:51:30.278 --> 01:51:32.382
MARISHA: Yeah! [inaudible] royalty!

3059
01:51:32.382 --> 01:51:35.434
LIAM: That is a reaction spell.

3060
01:51:35.434 --> 01:51:37.426
ASHLEY: I finish the leg, I lick my fingers,

3061
01:51:37.426 --> 01:51:38.703
and I walk back to the bubble

3062
01:51:38.703 --> 01:51:42.990
but say: Thank you very much. That was very good.

3063
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:45.931
MATT: They all, (grunts) gesture and

3064
01:51:45.931 --> 01:51:50.370
they say a few things in Giant. (speaking Giant)

3065
01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:53.437
ASHLEY: Yep. (imitating Giant)

3066
01:51:53.437 --> 01:51:56.905
(laughter)

3067
01:51:56.905 --> 01:51:58.336
LAURA: What's it taste like, Yasha?

3068
01:51:58.336 --> 01:52:00.555
ASHLEY: Oh, do you want to try?

3069
01:52:00.555 --> 01:52:03.705
LAURA: Oh, oh, okay!

3070
01:52:04.556 --> 01:52:06.843
ASHLEY: I walk back over and say.

3071
01:52:06.843 --> 01:52:10.464
MATT: Their amusement seems to have dissipated slightly

3072
01:52:10.464 --> 01:52:13.067
as you have now come back for seconds

3073
01:52:13.067 --> 01:52:14.975
on what is a meal that they spent most of the day hunting.

3074
01:52:14.975 --> 01:52:17.309
LAURA: I'm waving.

3075
01:52:17.309 --> 01:52:18.528
ASHLEY: Teeny bite?

3076
01:52:18.528 --> 01:52:20.667
MATT: One of them reaches forward and

3077
01:52:20.667 --> 01:52:23.547
takes off this itty bitty little piece

3078
01:52:23.547 --> 01:52:25.581
and flicks it toward you, Jester.

3079
01:52:25.581 --> 01:52:28.384
A tiny piece for them is like a handful.

3080
01:52:28.384 --> 01:52:33.384
Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

3081
01:52:34.246 --> 01:52:36.704
LAURA: Saving throw?
MATT: Yes.

3082
01:52:36.704 --> 01:52:38.806
LIAM: Catch it, catch it, catch it.

3083
01:52:38.806 --> 01:52:40.241
LAURA: That was almost really awesome, 11.

3084
01:52:40.241 --> 01:52:43.979
MATT: You got to catch it and it gets you right in the face,

3085
01:52:43.979 --> 01:52:46.652
you tumble back and (impacting).

3086
01:52:46.652 --> 01:52:47.701
Ass over tea kettle onto the ground,

3087
01:52:47.701 --> 01:52:51.899
and reach up and (slurps) pull the still juicy

3088
01:52:51.899 --> 01:52:53.584
spider meat from your face.

3089
01:52:53.584 --> 01:52:54.864
ASHLEY: That's actually a very good piece,

3090
01:52:54.864 --> 01:52:56.304
so if you don't eat it all,

3091
01:52:56.304 --> 01:53:00.064
I will have whatever you do not eat.

3092
01:53:00.064 --> 01:53:01.600
It's good, yeah?

3093
01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:02.640
MATT: It's not too bad.

3094
01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:07.579
It's reminiscent of like a tougher crab.

3095
01:53:07.579 --> 01:53:08.570
LAURA: That's what I was thinking it was

3096
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:11.503
going to taste like! It tastes like a tougher crab.

3097
01:53:11.503 --> 01:53:14.274
ASHLEY: It's like instead of seafood, it's land food.

3098
01:53:14.274 --> 01:53:16.316
LAURA: That was really good,

3099
01:53:16.316 --> 01:53:17.567
Yasha, here, knock yourself out.

3100
01:53:17.567 --> 01:53:19.206
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll have the rest.

3101
01:53:19.206 --> 01:53:20.039
MATT: I will ask you both to make

3102
01:53:20.039 --> 01:53:21.264
a constitution saving throw.

3103
01:53:21.264 --> 01:53:23.067
ASHLEY: Uh-oh.

3104
01:53:23.067 --> 01:53:23.900
SAM: Or you become spiders.

3105
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:26.192
MARISHA: Wait, is this one of his jokey times?

3106
01:53:26.192 --> 01:53:27.312
LIAM: No, there's poison in that.

3107
01:53:27.312 --> 01:53:28.728
MARISHA: It's a real time.

3108
01:53:28.728 --> 01:53:30.258
LAURA: Nine.

3109
01:53:30.258 --> 01:53:33.978
SAM: Oh god.
ASHLEY: 25.

3110
01:53:33.978 --> 01:53:35.694
TRAVIS: Oh shit, it's not cooked or something?

3111
01:53:35.694 --> 01:53:36.696
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3112
01:53:36.696 --> 01:53:39.240
MATT: You eat it and it's delicious,

3113
01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:41.683
and you're like, "Yeah I did it." You both go back to bed,

3114
01:53:41.683 --> 01:53:44.344
and you recall the spiders in the Vermaloc.

3115
01:53:44.344 --> 01:53:47.427
They're massive and they're venomous.

3116
01:53:49.679 --> 01:53:52.846
Jester, you start (groaning).

3117
01:53:52.846 --> 01:53:55.624
Getting a little bit of that sound in your stomach.

3118
01:53:55.624 --> 01:53:57.603
You are considered poisoned for the next hour.

3119
01:53:57.603 --> 01:54:00.770
LAURA: Oh!
(groaning)

3120
01:54:03.265 --> 01:54:07.081
LAURA: I feel like I'm going to get the spins.

3121
01:54:07.081 --> 01:54:08.465
SAM: Spins?
LAURA: Yeah.

3122
01:54:08.465 --> 01:54:10.305
SAM: What's a spin?
TALIESIN: Oh, the spins.

3123
01:54:10.305 --> 01:54:11.708
LAURA: It's where you're pooping,

3124
01:54:11.708 --> 01:54:13.321
but you have to throw up at the same time.

3125
01:54:13.321 --> 01:54:15.138
SAM: Oh, god!

3126
01:54:15.138 --> 01:54:15.971
LIAM: If you are going to squirt,

3127
01:54:15.971 --> 01:54:17.686
do not do it inside of the dome.

3128
01:54:17.686 --> 01:54:18.519
SAM: Get out of the dome!

3129
01:54:18.519 --> 01:54:20.889
LAURA: No, but they're going to step on me if I leave.

3130
01:54:20.889 --> 01:54:23.221
SAM: No, they won't. Just get out of the dome.

3131
01:54:23.221 --> 01:54:25.549
MARISHA: I accompany Jester and hold her hair back.

3132
01:54:25.549 --> 01:54:26.382
TALIESIN: Hey.

3133
01:54:26.382 --> 01:54:27.215
TRAVIS: That might not be where--

3134
01:54:27.215 --> 01:54:28.898
LIAM: How does that help or add--

3135
01:54:28.898 --> 01:54:31.054
MARISHA: I, hold her hair back

3136
01:54:31.054 --> 01:54:33.475
and it's super awkward while she's squatting.

3137
01:54:33.475 --> 01:54:35.832
Yeah.
(laughter)

3138
01:54:35.832 --> 01:54:39.984
LIAM: Boosh!
(groaning)

3139
01:54:39.984 --> 01:54:42.510
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Bonding.

3140
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:45.587
TRAVIS: Prestidigitation, please!

3141
01:54:45.587 --> 01:54:48.265
MATT: An evening of--
MARISHA: Just lavender.

3142
01:54:48.265 --> 01:54:51.043
Lavender scents.

3143
01:54:51.043 --> 01:54:52.760
LAURA: Every time before I have to fart,

3144
01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:54.899
I use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like birds chirping

3145
01:54:54.899 --> 01:54:56.913
so nobody can hear it.
(laughter)

3146
01:54:56.913 --> 01:55:00.162
(birds calling)

3147
01:55:00.162 --> 01:55:03.053
MATT: Definitely one of the most unique uses of Thaumaturgy,

3148
01:55:03.053 --> 01:55:07.042
I think, in my experience so far.

3149
01:55:07.042 --> 01:55:08.952
(whistling)

3150
01:55:08.952 --> 01:55:10.349
LIAM: (gun cocking and firing)

3151
01:55:10.349 --> 01:55:13.651
MATT: Okay, so after an evening of bonding,

3152
01:55:13.651 --> 01:55:16.632
a full night's rest is gained.

3153
01:55:16.632 --> 01:55:20.355
It takes you a little longer to recover by the morning,

3154
01:55:20.355 --> 01:55:21.963
but you had your spider meat.

3155
01:55:21.963 --> 01:55:24.250
You tried spider meat.
LAURA: (weakly) Yay.

3156
01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:26.335
MATT: The cold morning greets you

3157
01:55:26.335 --> 01:55:30.485
as you emerge from the hut.

3158
01:55:31.502 --> 01:55:34.385
There is that morning frost that's gathered

3159
01:55:34.385 --> 01:55:38.768
across bits of the foliage and dead leaves

3160
01:55:38.768 --> 01:55:41.044
that are covering the open ground here

3161
01:55:41.044 --> 01:55:42.922
within the Steelworks.

3162
01:55:42.922 --> 01:55:45.604
Most of the giants are still sleeping.

3163
01:55:45.604 --> 01:55:47.423
The two of them that are awake,

3164
01:55:47.423 --> 01:55:49.183
they're all passed out on the ground,

3165
01:55:49.183 --> 01:55:50.682
out around where the bonfire was,

3166
01:55:50.682 --> 01:55:52.629
which is now this low cinder.

3167
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:54.559
There's still smoke pouring up from it.

3168
01:55:54.559 --> 01:55:57.029
You can see the embers and the elements

3169
01:55:57.029 --> 01:55:59.029
that were once the furniture and other things

3170
01:55:59.029 --> 01:56:00.425
that were gathered for it,

3171
01:56:00.425 --> 01:56:02.623
some shapes are still recognizable inside the bonfire,

3172
01:56:02.623 --> 01:56:04.288
but it's mostly burned out.

3173
01:56:04.288 --> 01:56:06.888
TALIESIN: Chair.

3174
01:56:06.888 --> 01:56:08.540
MATT: You hear some rustling,

3175
01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:10.943
and across the way by the southern gate

3176
01:56:10.943 --> 01:56:12.965
you can see Soorna currently has placed

3177
01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:14.663
a big cloak over her shoulder,

3178
01:56:14.663 --> 01:56:17.407
and is gathering and putting rocks

3179
01:56:17.407 --> 01:56:20.325
inside a big, heavy satchel on the side.

3180
01:56:20.325 --> 01:56:21.924
Takes the staff and mounts it,

3181
01:56:21.924 --> 01:56:25.757
and turns around and looks at the rest of you.

3182
01:56:27.858 --> 01:56:29.770
SAM: Let's go.

3183
01:56:29.770 --> 01:56:33.469
TRAVIS: You want to like (whistles) call your?

3184
01:56:33.469 --> 01:56:35.615
SAM: Moorbounders?

3185
01:56:35.615 --> 01:56:37.046
LAURA: Yeah, I thought we were going to get them.

3186
01:56:37.046 --> 01:56:38.196
LIAM: To ride them, yeah.

3187
01:56:38.196 --> 01:56:39.611
TALIESIN: We'll grab them on the way out.

3188
01:56:39.611 --> 01:56:40.534
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

3189
01:56:40.534 --> 01:56:41.402
TALIESIN: We have, yeah.

3190
01:56:41.402 --> 01:56:42.959
MATT: You guys grab the moorbounders,

3191
01:56:42.959 --> 01:56:47.376
and as your ride them in, Soorna looks a bit,

3192
01:56:48.779 --> 01:56:50.298
just looks to you and goes,

3193
01:56:50.298 --> 01:56:52.058
"I am not familiar with these beasts,

3194
01:56:52.058 --> 01:56:55.233
"but keep them controlled."

3195
01:56:55.233 --> 01:56:56.571
TALIESIN: Do our best.

3196
01:56:56.571 --> 01:56:59.135
MATT: She seems a bit skittish.

3197
01:56:59.135 --> 01:57:00.060
TALIESIN: New friends.

3198
01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:02.441
Friend, friend, all right?

3199
01:57:02.441 --> 01:57:04.933
MATT: Clarabelle's like (snorting).

3200
01:57:04.933 --> 01:57:06.512
TALIESIN: She knows.

3201
01:57:06.512 --> 01:57:10.976
MATT: Soorna is not comfortable with these things.

3202
01:57:10.976 --> 01:57:15.176
Definitely seems to let them be your problem for now.

3203
01:57:15.176 --> 01:57:18.284
Opening the southern gate, you all exit

3204
01:57:18.284 --> 01:57:21.235
and begin to make your way into the Vermaloc Forest.

3205
01:57:21.235 --> 01:57:24.704
At her behest, you see Soorna is now guiding the path,

3206
01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:28.219
the Landspeaker taking you towards where

3207
01:57:28.219 --> 01:57:31.323
this problem all seemed to start.

3208
01:57:31.323 --> 01:57:34.573
That where we'll take a break.

3209
01:57:35.901 --> 01:57:37.584
MARISHA: So fun!

3210
01:57:37.584 --> 01:57:39.359
TRAVIS: We've got a giant fighting with us!

3211
01:57:39.359 --> 01:57:43.664
MATT: You do! You have a giant druid fighting with you.

3212
01:57:43.664 --> 01:57:45.984
They're not going to leave the space.

3213
01:57:45.984 --> 01:57:48.197
They're like, "We'll lose one of our kind,

3214
01:57:48.197 --> 01:57:52.012
"and the one that seems to have the most faith in you all.

3215
01:57:52.012 --> 01:57:53.898
"The rest of us either don't want to go back

3216
01:57:53.898 --> 01:57:56.357
"or don't want to possibly let the rest of the humans

3217
01:57:56.357 --> 01:57:58.138
"have an opportunity to take this back

3218
01:57:58.138 --> 01:57:59.082
"while you're missing."
LIAM: The one with

3219
01:57:59.082 --> 01:58:00.607
the biggest brain.

3220
01:58:00.607 --> 01:58:02.927
MATT: We'll be back here in just a few minutes.

3221
01:58:02.927 --> 01:58:05.769
Before we come back, we do have our Wyrmwood giveaway

3222
01:58:05.769 --> 01:58:06.943
from my friends at Wyrmwood.

3223
01:58:06.943 --> 01:58:09.844
Tonight--you get to look at this.

3224
01:58:09.844 --> 01:58:12.885
This is a fantastic, the tabletop tile sets

3225
01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:13.909
that they've been making.

3226
01:58:13.909 --> 01:58:15.182
These are various Wyrmwood types.

3227
01:58:15.182 --> 01:58:16.670
You can see all the different types of wood available

3228
01:58:16.670 --> 01:58:19.956
in this cluster here. Be sure to check out

3229
01:58:19.956 --> 01:58:21.095
Wyrmwood's Kickstarter campaign

3230
01:58:21.095 --> 01:58:23.258
to pick up your own set if you're interested.

3231
01:58:23.258 --> 01:58:24.218
They have all different uses,

3232
01:58:24.218 --> 01:58:25.940
like tiny dice roller set.

3233
01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:29.198
Tiny dice prison.

3234
01:58:29.198 --> 01:58:31.546
Trackers for spells and stuff.

3235
01:58:31.546 --> 01:58:33.121
It's pretty badass, so check it out

3236
01:58:33.121 --> 01:58:34.207
and see if it's something you like,

3237
01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:35.370
but we have this to be given away

3238
01:58:35.370 --> 01:58:37.391
to one of you folks when we return here from the break.

3239
01:58:37.391 --> 01:58:42.307
Tonight's password is grateful, because we are.

3240
01:58:42.307 --> 01:58:45.126
It is grateful, enter it once in the chat.

3241
01:58:45.126 --> 01:58:47.047
Any more than that and you'll be disqualified.

3242
01:58:47.047 --> 01:58:49.210
For our friends in the U.S. and Canada,

3243
01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:51.290
and excluding Quebec who are applicable.

3244
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:52.367
We'll return here from the break

3245
01:58:52.367 --> 01:58:53.924
and have a winner shortly.

3246
01:58:53.924 --> 01:58:55.304

BRIAN: Tough backdoor to kick down.

3269
01:59:50.097 --> 01:59:51.006
LIAM: Yeah.
DANI: Y'all!

3270
01:59:51.006 --> 01:59:51.839
TALIESIN: Wow.

3271
01:59:51.839 --> 01:59:52.672
DANI: Y'all!

3272
01:59:52.672 --> 01:59:55.591
BRIAN: Talking about robbing a house! Am I robbing a house?

3273
01:59:55.591 --> 01:59:56.649
DANI: Next question!

3274
01:59:56.649 --> 01:59:57.482
TALIESIN: I love you.

3275
01:59:57.482 --> 01:59:58.798
BRIAN: Talking about robbing a house!

3276
01:59:58.798 --> 01:59:59.873
LIAM: Not every nut is easy

3277
01:59:59.873 --> 02:00:01.776
to crack, Dani.
DANI: (fake sobbing)

3278
02:00:01.776 --> 02:00:03.336
BRIAN: Especially if there's more than one.

3279
02:00:03.336 --> 02:00:04.600
LIAM: Oh, Henry.

3280
02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:06.533
BRIAN: He got a couple hundred treats.

3281
02:00:06.533 --> 02:00:08.833
MARISHA: Your soul is forfeit!

3282
02:00:08.833 --> 02:00:11.858
BRIAN: Aw, goddamn it, again?

3283
02:00:11.858 --> 02:00:14.402
We just had a whole episode of this, ow!

3284
02:00:14.402 --> 02:00:16.568
And with that laser pointer.

3285
02:00:16.568 --> 02:00:17.743
MARISHA: (screaming)

3286
02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:19.089
BRIAN: Ah, Jesus Christ.
DANI: Bye, Marisha.

3287
02:00:19.089 --> 02:00:21.229
TRAVIS: Long hours.
BRIAN: Can we move the set,

3288
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:22.909
people, so that I don't have to deal

3289
02:00:22.909 --> 02:00:24.265
with this every week?

3290
02:00:24.265 --> 02:00:28.434
Seedy88. "Which item that Professor Waccoh--

3291
02:00:32.753 --> 02:00:34.535
TALIESIN: I want the fancy new staff.

3292
02:00:34.535 --> 02:00:35.371
LIAM: Yeah, oh?

3293
02:00:35.371 --> 02:00:37.621
TALIESIN: That fancy new staff is a fancy staff.

3294
02:00:37.621 --> 02:00:39.144
BRIAN: Sure.

3295
02:00:39.144 --> 02:00:40.492
TALIESIN: I'd like to shove my crystal

3296
02:00:40.492 --> 02:00:43.089
into that staff.
DANI: Oh, boy!

3297
02:00:43.089 --> 02:00:44.310
BRIAN: Which end does it go in?

3298
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:47.009
TALIESIN: I mean, honestly, it's either end.

3299
02:00:47.009 --> 02:00:49.713
LIAM: The butt end of the staff, are we talking about?

3300
02:00:49.713 --> 02:00:51.334
BRIAN: He said either end is fine,

3301
02:00:51.334 --> 02:00:53.090
so it's ultimately up to how the staff's feeling that day.

3302
02:00:53.090 --> 02:00:55.654
TALIESIN: Well yeah, and you have to work it either way.

3303
02:00:55.654 --> 02:00:58.428
I mean like it's--you're going to have to, you know.

3304
02:00:58.428 --> 02:01:01.067
BRIAN: Is the staff not fitted for that exact crystal

3305
02:01:01.067 --> 02:01:02.629
or does it sort of--
TALIESIN: No, you got to

3306
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:04.049
make it fit, though.

3307
02:01:04.049 --> 02:01:05.887
BRIAN: Over time, it gets easier.

3308
02:01:05.887 --> 02:01:07.723
DANI: Y'all make me so tired.

3309
02:01:07.723 --> 02:01:09.181
BRIAN: Why? This is all the shit

3310
02:01:09.181 --> 02:01:11.168
you look up on the internet.

3311
02:01:11.168 --> 02:01:13.610
DANI: That is in my private time or for charity!

3312
02:01:13.610 --> 02:01:15.968
BRIAN: Oh, we're on the clock. We're on the clock.

3313
02:01:15.968 --> 02:01:17.485
We're on the clock.

3314
02:01:17.485 --> 02:01:19.421
BRIAN: That feels good, huh? That feels good.

3315
02:01:19.421 --> 02:01:20.565
TALIESIN: He's got it figured out.

3316
02:01:20.565 --> 02:01:23.030
BRIAN: That's a sweet boy.

3317
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:24.284
LIAM: That's it, this is the show.

3318
02:01:24.284 --> 02:01:26.533
BRIAN: You can sign us off if you want, man.

3319
02:01:26.533 --> 02:01:28.292
LIAM: No way!
BRIAN: Yeah, go ahead.

3320
02:01:28.292 --> 02:01:29.173
LIAM: No way!

3321
02:01:29.173 --> 02:01:32.896
Liam, that's all the time we have for tonight.

3322
02:01:32.896 --> 02:01:34.336
I would like to thank Taliesin

3323
02:01:34.336 --> 02:01:36.357
and Brain for joining us tonight.

3324
02:01:36.357 --> 02:01:41.357
Episode, it's not 69, but 59 is this Thursday. As always,

3325
02:01:41.626 --> 02:01:45.709
don't forget to love each other, and don't worry.

3326
02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.548
It's almost Thursday.

3327
02:01:48.548 --> 02:01:52.315
Stay turnt, my friends.

3328
02:01:52.315 --> 02:01:54.751
And remember (laughs)...

3329
02:01:54.751 --> 02:01:55.584
BRIAN: Here we go.

3330
02:01:55.584 --> 02:01:57.866
LIAM: Creepy ain't a crime,

3331
02:01:57.866 --> 02:01:59.818
and neither is D&amp;D.

3332
02:01:59.818 --> 02:02:02.063
DANI: Can you give me a B take?

3333
02:02:02.063 --> 02:02:04.988
LIAM: (exaggerated exhale)

3334
02:02:09.799 --> 02:02:12.549
TALIESIN: (snaps)

3335
02:02:19.399 --> 02:02:22.663
TRAVIS: (whimpering)

3336
02:02:22.663 --> 02:02:23.922
Oh my god, you guys!

3337
02:02:23.922 --> 02:02:24.962
We did it!

3338
02:02:24.962 --> 02:02:29.501
Ten million dollars, you guys are absolutely insane.

3339
02:02:29.501 --> 02:02:32.541
Thank you so, so much for your amazing generosity,

3340
02:02:32.541 --> 02:02:34.679
your support, your love, your passion.

3341
02:02:34.679 --> 02:02:36.137
I can't believe it.

3342
02:02:36.137 --> 02:02:38.621
This cartoon is going to be absolutely incredible.

3343
02:02:38.621 --> 02:02:40.023
It's going to be even more amazing

3344
02:02:40.023 --> 02:02:44.119
than it was before. With hitting ten million dollars,

3345
02:02:44.119 --> 02:02:47.877
I am going to be

3346
02:02:47.877 --> 02:02:50.193
going to a haunted house.

3347
02:02:50.193 --> 02:02:51.653
My favorite thing in the world.

3348
02:02:51.653 --> 02:02:53.712
You should know that I try to go

3349
02:02:53.712 --> 02:02:55.915
to haunted houses every year to try

3350
02:02:55.915 --> 02:02:57.834
and build up a tolerance to those things,

3351
02:02:57.834 --> 02:03:02.368
but I reflexively scare easy, okay?

3352
02:03:02.368 --> 02:03:03.589
I like to buy in.

3353
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:06.336
I buy into the mythos of the particular house that I'm--

3354
02:03:06.336 --> 02:03:08.606
DANI: Travis, congratulations!
TRAVIS: Oh my--!

3355
02:03:08.606 --> 02:03:11.047
DANI: Oh, this is going to be so fun.

3356
02:03:11.047 --> 02:03:13.105
TRAVIS: Gods.

3357
02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:15.183
Anybody else?

3358
02:03:15.183 --> 02:03:18.564
Anyone else want to be fucking, huh, yeah?

3359
02:03:18.564 --> 02:03:19.683
Cute?

3360
02:03:19.683 --> 02:03:22.639
Okay, so probably in October,

3361
02:03:22.639 --> 02:03:25.080
I will go through a haunted house

3362
02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:27.245
and it will be caught on film,

3363
02:03:27.245 --> 02:03:30.328
and you can all laugh as my giant six--

3364
02:03:31.730 --> 02:03:35.138

3365
02:03:35.138 --> 02:03:38.421
screams in terror and panic.

3366
02:03:38.421 --> 02:03:39.818
This video's done.

3367
02:03:39.818 --> 02:03:42.024
We love you guys so much.

3368
02:03:42.024 --> 02:03:44.184
Can't wait to keep you posted and updated

3369
02:03:44.184 --> 02:03:45.885
on how things develop.
(canine howling)

3370
02:03:45.885 --> 02:03:47.405
What the fuck was that?

3371
02:03:47.405 --> 02:03:49.348
Was that Henry?

3372
02:03:49.348 --> 02:03:51.475
I got to go, bye.

TALIESIN: Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

3376
02:03:59.613 --> 02:04:03.143
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

3377
02:04:03.143 --> 02:04:07.197
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic congregation

3378
02:04:07.197 --> 02:04:10.355
on the other side of, the fourth wall.

3379
02:04:10.355 --> 02:04:12.797
And what is this, fourth wall

3380
02:04:12.797 --> 02:04:16.075
separating the viewer from the creator?

3381
02:04:16.075 --> 02:04:18.375
A portal to an often sought point of connection,

3382
02:04:18.375 --> 02:04:22.742
or the Twitch subscription zone?

3383
02:04:22.742 --> 02:04:24.451
On the rare occasion that you miss

3384
02:04:24.451 --> 02:04:27.208
the live bacchanal boasted by the ragtag group

3385
02:04:27.208 --> 02:04:29.491
of thespians on Thursday night,

3386
02:04:29.491 --> 02:04:31.565
you may always view the show on demand

3387
02:04:31.565 --> 02:04:33.275
in the shadowland known as,

3388
02:04:33.275 --> 02:04:36.173
the Twitch subscription zone.

3389
02:04:36.173 --> 02:04:38.853
Picture, if you will, the necessary pieces

3390
02:04:38.853 --> 02:04:40.694
to complete a jigsaw puzzle,

3391
02:04:40.694 --> 02:04:43.833
but it's up to you to choose how it will be solved.

3392
02:04:43.833 --> 02:04:48.012
You could, of course, subscribe with your debt rectangle,

3393
02:04:48.012 --> 02:04:50.925
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

3394
02:04:50.925 --> 02:04:52.504
Perhaps you found yourself in possession

3395
02:04:52.504 --> 02:04:56.512
of an Amazon Prime account.

3396
02:04:56.512 --> 02:04:58.281
You would then wake up to discover

3397
02:04:58.281 --> 02:05:00.147
a free Twitch subscription each month

3398
02:05:00.147 --> 02:05:02.323
for a channel of your choosing.

3399
02:05:02.323 --> 02:05:04.163
But this artifact demands renewal,

3400
02:05:04.163 --> 02:05:06.664
for you must re-subscribe each month

3401
02:05:06.664 --> 02:05:09.245
to quench its unyielding thirst.

3402
02:05:09.245 --> 02:05:11.584
One need not walk alone.

3403
02:05:11.584 --> 02:05:13.404
Those who have already found their way

3404
02:05:13.404 --> 02:05:15.304
can illuminate the path for others,

3405
02:05:15.304 --> 02:05:18.304
via the Gift a Sub button on Twitch.

3406
02:05:19.548 --> 02:05:22.312
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription

3407
02:05:22.312 --> 02:05:25.032
and wishes to thank you from behind the thin veil

3408
02:05:25.032 --> 02:05:27.699
of this, fourth wall.

02:05:27.699 --> 02:05:29.848
We hope you enjoy our content as much

3410
02:05:29.848 --> 02:05:31.343
as we enjoy making it.

And so ends another meandering digression,

3412
02:05:34.029 --> 02:05:37.571
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

3413
02:05:37.571 --> 02:05:41.884

3431
02:21:06.559 --> 02:21:08.937
into the depths of the Vermaloc,

02:21:08.937 --> 02:21:13.727

02:21:39.007 --> 02:21:41.705
to go on an adventure, and I jumped at it like that.

3443
02:21:41.705 --> 02:21:43.145
Am I a bad person?

3444
02:21:43.145 --> 02:21:45.044
I just left and I ditched my husband

3445
02:21:45.044 --> 02:21:48.772
in a den on monsters to go adventuring with you.

3446
02:21:48.772 --> 02:21:50.649
LIAM: Well, I think partially, you are an addict

3447
02:21:50.649 --> 02:21:52.982
like the rest of us, but no.

3448
02:21:54.673 --> 02:21:56.713
Don't think in the micro, think in the macro.

3449
02:21:56.713 --> 02:21:58.511
You want to make where you are from,

3450
02:21:58.511 --> 02:22:02.111
our home, the Empire safe again.

3451
02:22:02.111 --> 02:22:04.271
To do that, we have a certain number

3452
02:22:04.271 --> 02:22:05.311
of steps ahead of us.

3453
02:22:05.311 --> 02:22:07.769
We have to cozy up to the people

3454
02:22:07.769 --> 02:22:11.071
we are staying with and work that to our advantage,

3455
02:22:11.071 --> 02:22:15.054
and turn the world on its head.

3456
02:22:15.054 --> 02:22:20.054
SAM: You don't think I'm just delaying the inevitable?

3457
02:22:20.127 --> 02:22:24.027
Scared of going back

3458
02:22:24.027 --> 02:22:26.752
to my old life or anything?

3459
02:22:28.412 --> 02:22:32.004
LIAM: Would you prefer I call you Nott or Veth

3460
02:22:32.004 --> 02:22:33.540
when we are apart from your husband?

3461
02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:36.882
SAM: I don't know anymore.

3462
02:22:36.882 --> 02:22:39.039
I guess let's just keep it with Nott.

3463
02:22:39.039 --> 02:22:40.041
LIAM: All right.
SAM: It's just,

3464
02:22:40.041 --> 02:22:41.364
I don't know like,

3465
02:22:41.364 --> 02:22:45.631
is he going to even like me anymore?

3466
02:22:45.631 --> 02:22:47.460
I'm so different, not just physically.

3467
02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:49.625
I do different things now.

3468
02:22:49.625 --> 02:22:52.004
LIAM: Well, the way that he talked to you,

3469
02:22:52.004 --> 02:22:53.764
I would not have anything to worry about.

3470
02:22:53.764 --> 02:22:57.044
SAM: That was just where he was just happy to see me alive.

3471
02:22:57.044 --> 02:22:59.369
But, you know.

3472
02:22:59.369 --> 02:23:02.961
LIAM: I think you might be wrong.

3473
02:23:02.961 --> 02:23:04.665
I can't say I'm 100% certain,

3474
02:23:04.665 --> 02:23:06.089
but I think you might be.

3475
02:23:06.089 --> 02:23:08.772
SAM: But will <i>I</i> like it?

3476
02:23:10.184 --> 02:23:11.092
LIAM: (sighs)

3477
02:23:11.092 --> 02:23:15.222
SAM: I've gotten a taste of adventure and seeing the world,

3478
02:23:15.222 --> 02:23:19.876
and now I got to go back and be a housewife again?

3479
02:23:19.876 --> 02:23:23.094
LIAM: Question, is Beauregard here, as well?

3480
02:23:23.094 --> 02:23:24.537
MATT: You are walking together.

3481
02:23:24.537 --> 02:23:26.335
LIAM: Oh, we're not on our moorbounders?

3482
02:23:26.335 --> 02:23:27.577
MATT: Oh, sorry, you're on your moorbounders, correct.

3483
02:23:27.577 --> 02:23:29.257
LIAM: Because we had ridden together in the past,

3484
02:23:29.257 --> 02:23:30.090
so it's up to Beauregard.

3485
02:23:30.090 --> 02:23:31.757
LAURA: Beau can be with us if she wants to be.

3486
02:23:31.757 --> 02:23:33.967
MARISHA: I--wherever.

3487
02:23:33.967 --> 02:23:35.075
LIAM: It's up to you.

3488
02:23:35.075 --> 02:23:37.388
MARISHA: I'm on a moorbounder.

3489
02:23:37.388 --> 02:23:40.014
MATT: Are you with them or are you with Jester and Yasha?

3490
02:23:40.014 --> 02:23:41.511
MARISHA: With Jester and Yasha,

3491
02:23:41.511 --> 02:23:43.336
I would have balanced it out.

3492
02:23:43.336 --> 02:23:45.879
LAURA: It was me and Fjord.
MATT: Oh, you and Fjord?

3493
02:23:45.879 --> 02:23:47.120
TALIESIN: Yeah, we were together.

3494
02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:48.467
MARISHA: No, I guess I would rode through with you.

3495
02:23:48.467 --> 02:23:50.004
Is that weird?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3496
02:23:50.004 --> 02:23:52.766
MARISHA: I'm not listening up to this point, though.

3497
02:23:52.766 --> 02:23:55.006
LIAM: Wait, are you with us then?

3498
02:23:55.006 --> 02:23:55.966
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: She is, yes.

3499
02:23:55.966 --> 02:24:00.400
LIAM: Okay, well Nott, I don't know.

3500
02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:03.231
I think you have to find those answers.

3501
02:24:03.231 --> 02:24:04.558
SAM: Can't you just tell me?

3502
02:24:04.558 --> 02:24:07.800
LIAM: I cannot, Nott.

3503
02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:12.566
But I am glad you're here.

3504
02:24:13.458 --> 02:24:14.706
SAM: You don't think I'm terrible

3505
02:24:14.706 --> 02:24:18.608
for leaving him in a hotel room?

3506
02:24:18.608 --> 02:24:21.885
LIAM: Do I think that some amount of time

3507
02:24:21.885 --> 02:24:26.293
after you drowned

3508
02:24:26.293 --> 02:24:29.693
and were changed into something other than you are,

3509
02:24:30.723 --> 02:24:34.269
and have ridden halfway across the world,

3510
02:24:34.269 --> 02:24:36.121
and are in enemy territory,

3511
02:24:36.121 --> 02:24:37.965
and you are acting strangely,

3512
02:24:37.965 --> 02:24:39.623
are you asking me if I judge you?

3513
02:24:39.623 --> 02:24:41.970
Or if you should judge yourself

3514
02:24:41.970 --> 02:24:43.772
for the way you are acting right now?

3515
02:24:43.772 --> 02:24:45.963
Because I don't.

3516
02:24:47.982 --> 02:24:49.842
SAM: Well thank you.

3517
02:24:49.842 --> 02:24:52.759
That makes me feel a little better.

3518
02:24:55.441 --> 02:24:56.607
LIAM: I think that we are

3519
02:24:56.607 --> 02:24:58.584
actually working towards something.

3520
02:24:58.584 --> 02:25:01.433
Are you awake?

3521
02:25:01.433 --> 02:25:05.402
MARISHA: Hmm? I'm not listening at all.

3522
02:25:05.402 --> 02:25:09.743
LIAM: She's very skilled, but I think she's listening.

3523
02:25:09.743 --> 02:25:12.113
MARISHA: Nope, not listening.

3524
02:25:12.113 --> 02:25:15.580
LIAM: Not at all.
MARISHA: Nope.

3525
02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:17.737
LIAM: I think that we are working

3526
02:25:17.737 --> 02:25:20.853
towards something very good.

3527
02:25:22.030 --> 02:25:24.712
We could fritter our life away

3528
02:25:24.712 --> 02:25:29.279
and abandon hope, you and I.

3529
02:25:31.751 --> 02:25:36.146
But you're not. You are working toward something good.

3530
02:25:36.146 --> 02:25:38.708
Your son needs a world to grow up in

3531
02:25:38.708 --> 02:25:41.208
with parents who love him, so.

3532
02:25:42.728 --> 02:25:45.645
You are feeling poorly? You are doubting yourself?

3533
02:25:45.645 --> 02:25:47.844
I understand that very well.

3534
02:25:47.844 --> 02:25:51.310
But I don't share your opinion of you.

3535
02:25:51.310 --> 02:25:53.377
Or this group.

3536
02:25:55.589 --> 02:25:58.435
SAM: Well, thank you.

3537
02:25:58.435 --> 02:26:00.392
Beau, what did he just say?

3538
02:26:00.392 --> 02:26:01.736
MARISHA: He doesn't share your--

3539
02:26:01.736 --> 02:26:03.173
SAM: You're not supposed to be listening!

3540
02:26:03.173 --> 02:26:04.536
MARISHA: I mean--
SAM: You're not supposed

3541
02:26:04.536 --> 02:26:05.774
to be listening!
MARISHA: He said ca-caw!

3542
02:26:05.774 --> 02:26:09.757
Ca-caw!
(laughter)

3543
02:26:10.916 --> 02:26:12.066
SAM: Betrayer!

3544
02:26:12.066 --> 02:26:16.312
LIAM: What about, what about that Caduceus, though?

3545
02:26:16.312 --> 02:26:17.774
MARISHA: What about him?
SAM: He's good.

3546
02:26:17.774 --> 02:26:19.550
MARISHA: Wait, are you actively

3547
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:21.518
talking to me now?
SAM: Yeah, you're engaged to--

3548
02:26:21.518 --> 02:26:23.214
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, okay.
LIAM: I'm pulling you in.

3549
02:26:23.214 --> 02:26:25.416
MARISHA: Yeah, what do you mean?

3550
02:26:25.416 --> 02:26:27.598
LIAM: He turned all of that around.

3551
02:26:27.598 --> 02:26:30.188
That could have been nothing but death

3552
02:26:30.188 --> 02:26:31.736
and the stench of killing.

3553
02:26:31.736 --> 02:26:36.273
SAM: To be fair, we don't know what he said in Giant.

3554
02:26:36.273 --> 02:26:38.936
It could have all been dick jokes or something.

3555
02:26:38.936 --> 02:26:41.016
Maybe it was terrible, what he said.

3556
02:26:41.016 --> 02:26:42.179
We have no idea.

3557
02:26:42.179 --> 02:26:44.238
LIAM: But you can't argue with the results.

3558
02:26:44.238 --> 02:26:45.875
SAM: That's right, whatever he said worked.

3559
02:26:45.875 --> 02:26:47.448
LIAM: Worked, maybe they like those dick jokes.

3560
02:26:47.448 --> 02:26:49.278
They are not crushing in our skulls.

3561
02:26:49.278 --> 02:26:51.054
MARISHA: I mean, unless he's planning some weird,

3562
02:26:51.054 --> 02:26:53.976
elaborate trap and he's developed some sort of scheme

3563
02:26:53.976 --> 02:26:56.696
with the giants and he's leading us astray

3564
02:26:56.696 --> 02:26:59.736
and he's planning to corner us and kill us

3565
02:26:59.736 --> 02:27:01.633
in those caves where no one

3566
02:27:01.633 --> 02:27:02.952
would ever find our bodies again.

3567
02:27:02.952 --> 02:27:04.579
I don't think he's doing that, though.

3568
02:27:04.579 --> 02:27:06.621
SAM: I look over at Caduceus. What's he doing?

3569
02:27:06.621 --> 02:27:07.970
TALIESIN: Matt? Now.

3570
02:27:07.970 --> 02:27:10.717
(laughter)

3571
02:27:11.576 --> 02:27:13.285
Thank you, thank you.

3572
02:27:13.285 --> 02:27:14.918
TRAVIS: Fucking knew it!

3573
02:27:14.918 --> 02:27:17.113
MATT: This whole time.

3574
02:27:17.113 --> 02:27:17.946
TRAVIS: Just too nice.

3575
02:27:17.946 --> 02:27:19.818
MATT: (laughing)

3576
02:27:19.818 --> 02:27:21.359
MARISHA: I mean demons, am I right?

3577
02:27:21.359 --> 02:27:23.082
TALIESIN: Have a cookie basket. Ah!

3578
02:27:23.082 --> 02:27:24.134
MARISHA: Oh, I don't know.

3579
02:27:24.134 --> 02:27:25.153
SAM: Yep!

3580
02:27:25.153 --> 02:27:26.055
MATT: Fjord?

3581
02:27:26.055 --> 02:27:28.556
As you rummage through the remnants of

3582
02:27:28.556 --> 02:27:31.073
the rest of that satchel you found.

3583
02:27:31.073 --> 02:27:32.628
TRAVIS: Ooh!

3584
02:27:32.628 --> 02:27:34.929
(cheering)

3585
02:27:34.929 --> 02:27:39.612
MATT: For your 20 on an investigation check.

3586
02:27:39.612 --> 02:27:40.672
SAM: A greater, what is that?

3587
02:27:40.672 --> 02:27:42.794
LAURA: One greater and two regulars.

3588
02:27:42.794 --> 02:27:43.809
LIAM: Grape Ape.

3589
02:27:43.809 --> 02:27:44.845
LAURA: Oh, you're rummaging through that

3590
02:27:44.845 --> 02:27:47.409
while you're on the moorbounder with me, Fjord.

3591
02:27:47.409 --> 02:27:48.242
TRAVIS: Yep.

3592
02:27:48.242 --> 02:27:50.177
LAURA: What'd you find? I hear clinking.

3593
02:27:50.177 --> 02:27:53.487
LIAM: That is hot, looking through a pharmacy bag.

3594
02:27:53.487 --> 02:27:57.015
TRAVIS: Just found some what looks to be healing potions.

3595
02:27:57.015 --> 02:27:58.690
LAURA: Oh, really? That'll be useful.

3596
02:27:58.690 --> 02:28:02.034
TRAVIS: Yep, for the non-clerics, it'll go a long way.

3597
02:28:02.034 --> 02:28:04.674
LAURA: That was really cool how you found that stuff.

3598
02:28:04.674 --> 02:28:05.874
TRAVIS: Oh, thanks!

3599
02:28:05.874 --> 02:28:08.324
Yeah, I mean I figured it was probably sitting

3600
02:28:08.324 --> 02:28:10.615
there waiting to be discovered. Just needed a keen eye.

3601
02:28:10.615 --> 02:28:12.199
LAURA: That's true, that's true.

3602
02:28:12.199 --> 02:28:15.229
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

3603
02:28:15.229 --> 02:28:17.979
(laughter)

3604
02:28:20.322 --> 02:28:22.446
MARISHA: It's old school. Yeah.

3605
02:28:22.446 --> 02:28:25.130
(ticking)

3606
02:28:25.130 --> 02:28:25.963
TRAVIS: Who do you think needs these

3607
02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:27.744
healing potions the most?

3608
02:28:27.744 --> 02:28:30.827
LAURA: Oh.
(Liam coughing)

3609
02:28:32.109 --> 02:28:35.207
I don't know, Caleb's pretty weak.

3610
02:28:35.207 --> 02:28:37.959
He goes down a lot.

3611
02:28:37.959 --> 02:28:39.295
LIAM: I've heard that.

3612
02:28:39.295 --> 02:28:40.212
TRAVIS: Who else?

3613
02:28:41.428 --> 02:28:44.520
LAURAL I mean, I guess,

3614
02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:47.621
I guess I could use one.

3615
02:28:47.621 --> 02:28:48.743
I don't have any.

3616
02:28:48.743 --> 02:28:51.612
TRAVIS: You don't have any healing potions, Jester?

3617
02:28:51.612 --> 02:28:55.021
LAURA: Well, no, but I have spells, so you know.

3618
02:28:55.021 --> 02:28:56.807
Beau could probably use one, too.

3619
02:28:56.807 --> 02:28:58.567
She's always up in the front.

3620
02:28:58.567 --> 02:29:00.484
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true.

3621
02:29:00.484 --> 02:29:02.277
SAM: Low branch.

3622
02:29:02.277 --> 02:29:05.313
LAURA: Oh shit.

3623
02:29:05.313 --> 02:29:06.668
TRAVIS: I tell you what,

3624
02:29:06.668 --> 02:29:09.911
how about we use this regular for Caleb?

3625
02:29:09.911 --> 02:29:10.744
LAURA: Okay.

3626
02:29:10.744 --> 02:29:12.580
TRAVIS: We use this regular for Beau.

3627
02:29:12.580 --> 02:29:13.496
LAURA: Okay.

3628
02:29:13.496 --> 02:29:17.738
TRAVIS: We'll give you this super powerful one.

3629
02:29:17.738 --> 02:29:21.178
LAURA: Fjord, do you have any healing potions?

3630
02:29:21.178 --> 02:29:23.538
TRAVIS: Nah, but you always look out for everybody,

3631
02:29:23.538 --> 02:29:25.510
so you might as well have it.

3632
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:27.632
LAURA: Yeah, but what if I can't get to you?

3633
02:29:27.632 --> 02:29:29.156
You keep it for yourself,

3634
02:29:29.156 --> 02:29:30.297
and when you take it,

3635
02:29:30.297 --> 02:29:33.406
just think of it as a spell from me, okay?

3636
02:29:33.406 --> 02:29:35.220
TRAVIS: Okay.

3637
02:29:35.220 --> 02:29:36.053
LAURA: Okay.

3638
02:29:36.053 --> 02:29:36.886
TRAVIS: You sure?

3639
02:29:36.886 --> 02:29:40.436
LAURA: Yeah. Also, have you seen this fucking locket?

3640
02:29:40.436 --> 02:29:41.676
Look at it.

3641
02:29:41.676 --> 02:29:45.926
TRAVIS: That's a very risque photo, Jester.

3642
02:29:45.926 --> 02:29:48.890
Would you close it?

3643
02:29:48.890 --> 02:29:52.973
LIAM: Flock of birds! (flapping)

3644
02:29:58.899 --> 02:29:59.815
TRAVIS: What?

3645
02:29:59.815 --> 02:30:01.031
LAURA: Nothing.

3646
02:30:01.031 --> 02:30:03.449
We just haven't talked a lot lately, that's all.

3647
02:30:03.449 --> 02:30:04.487
TRAVIS: Yep.

3648
02:30:04.487 --> 02:30:09.471
Seems like Yarnball has got a good,

3649
02:30:10.428 --> 02:30:13.661
you know, relationship with you.

3650
02:30:13.661 --> 02:30:15.367
What do you call it?

3651
02:30:15.367 --> 02:30:16.200
LAURA: Yarnball?

3652
02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:20.866
TRAVIS: Yep, it's a good, good dog, horse, cat.

3653
02:30:20.866 --> 02:30:24.033
LAURA: Fjord, you're being really awkward.

3654
02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.021
TRAVIS: No, I'm not.

3655
02:30:26.021 --> 02:30:26.854
LAURA: Yes, you are.

3656
02:30:26.854 --> 02:30:28.137
TRAVIS: I'm disarming you.

3657
02:30:28.137 --> 02:30:30.697
LAURA: You are being so awkward with me.

3658
02:30:30.697 --> 02:30:33.588
MATT: "(speaks Giant)" You hear the voice of Soorna

3659
02:30:33.588 --> 02:30:36.233
up ahead, holding her staff forward.

3660
02:30:36.233 --> 02:30:39.108
The red trees that you've been used to seeing,

3661
02:30:39.108 --> 02:30:42.473
the beautiful but generally unchanging scenery,

3662
02:30:42.473 --> 02:30:45.030
begins to shift.

3663
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:48.089
Beyond this immediate cluster,

3664
02:30:48.089 --> 02:30:50.369
the coloration goes a bit gray,

3665
02:30:50.369 --> 02:30:53.171
it loses its saturation.

3666
02:30:53.171 --> 02:30:55.731
The texture catches your eye a second.

3667
02:30:55.731 --> 02:30:57.171
You can see now there are scattered webs

3668
02:30:57.171 --> 02:31:02.171
that begin to stretch between the trees ahead.

3669
02:31:02.752 --> 02:31:06.427
TRAVIS: Well, I guess the buffet is ahead, right, Yasha?

3670
02:31:08.956 --> 02:31:10.617
Spiders.

3671
02:31:10.617 --> 02:31:12.495
ASHLEY: Yes, did you try any last night?

3672
02:31:12.495 --> 02:31:14.483
TRAVIS: No, I did not.

3673
02:31:14.483 --> 02:31:15.921
ASHLEY: It's very, very tasty.

3674
02:31:15.921 --> 02:31:19.020
LAURA: They are not as tasty as she makes them sound.

3675
02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:21.401
ASHLEY: Well, it's an acquired taste type of a thing.

3676
02:31:21.401 --> 02:31:25.719
It takes a little bit of time to really, you know--

3677
02:31:25.719 --> 02:31:27.561
LAURA: To not poop every time you eat them.

3678
02:31:27.561 --> 02:31:28.944
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say, you look

3679
02:31:28.944 --> 02:31:29.785
pale this morning.

3680
02:31:29.785 --> 02:31:31.746
I didn't quite notice when you first got--

3681
02:31:31.746 --> 02:31:36.152
LAURA: I mean not that, I wasn't pooping or anything.

3682
02:31:36.152 --> 02:31:38.414
Some people, I hear, poop when they--

3683
02:31:38.414 --> 02:31:41.054
ASHLEY: You can get the shits with it, yeah.

3684
02:31:41.054 --> 02:31:42.915
For sure, if you eat certain parts.

3685
02:31:42.915 --> 02:31:43.891
LAURA: Certainly not me,

3686
02:31:43.891 --> 02:31:46.026
because I don't do that.

3687
02:31:46.026 --> 02:31:46.859
TRAVIS: Yep.

3688
02:31:46.859 --> 02:31:50.670
ASHLEY: I only heard birds last night.

3689
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:52.051
TRAVIS: They were exceptionally loud last night.

3690
02:31:52.051 --> 02:31:53.707
ASHLEY: They were so loud!
TRAVIS: In like, percussive,

3691
02:31:53.707 --> 02:31:55.686
helicopter bursts.
AHSLEY: Yeah, yeah.

3692
02:31:55.686 --> 02:31:57.720
I didn't even know that they were around here that much

3693
02:31:57.720 --> 02:31:59.174
in the night.

3694
02:31:59.174 --> 02:32:00.955
LAURA: They sounded really charming.

3695
02:32:00.955 --> 02:32:01.859
ASHELY: Yeah.

3696
02:32:01.859 --> 02:32:02.699
TRAVIS: "Charming."

3697
02:32:02.699 --> 02:32:03.857
SAM: Cobra!

3698
02:32:03.857 --> 02:32:06.139
(laughter)

3699
02:32:06.139 --> 02:32:07.887
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,

3700
02:32:07.887 --> 02:32:12.299
Soorna begins to circle her staff

3701
02:32:12.299 --> 02:32:17.043
and a ball of fire apparates in the air in front of her,

3702
02:32:17.043 --> 02:32:19.980
drops on the ground, and begins to roll forward.

3703
02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:23.247
It rolls and pours into the first web.

3704
02:32:23.247 --> 02:32:25.804
The web burning back.

3705
02:32:25.804 --> 02:32:28.080
You hear (squeaking) as all these spiders

3706
02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:30.198
begin to skitter up. You see,

3707
02:32:30.198 --> 02:32:32.559
and of similar size, there are spiders

3708
02:32:32.559 --> 02:32:35.201
where their abdomen is about the size of Fjord.

3709
02:32:35.201 --> 02:32:36.034
They are very large.

3710
02:32:36.034 --> 02:32:39.939
Begin to pull away and scatter amongst the boughs

3711
02:32:39.939 --> 02:32:41.553
and canopies of the trees.

3712
02:32:41.553 --> 02:32:42.951
The ball continues to roll forward,

3713
02:32:42.951 --> 02:32:44.690
setting one web on flame.

3714
02:32:44.690 --> 02:32:47.069
Another one, another, burning a path,

3715
02:32:47.069 --> 02:32:48.565
and Soorna turns back to the rest of you.

3716
02:32:48.565 --> 02:32:49.526
(speaking Giant)

3717
02:32:49.526 --> 02:32:51.345
Or you hear, "Follow."

3718
02:32:51.345 --> 02:32:52.865
TRAVIS: We don't need to hear about that.

3719
02:32:52.865 --> 02:32:54.502
MARISHA: (attempts to speak Giant)

3720
02:32:54.502 --> 02:32:55.335
TRAVIS: What?

3721
02:32:55.335 --> 02:32:56.699
TALIESIN: Spiders, spiders.

3722
02:32:56.699 --> 02:33:00.159
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (attempt to speak Giant)

3723
02:33:00.159 --> 02:33:01.820
MARISHA: Is that what, is that?

3724
02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:03.062
MATT: As you walk through the flame,

3725
02:33:03.062 --> 02:33:04.481
the webs have burned back to the point

3726
02:33:04.481 --> 02:33:05.841
where they're not going to be a danger to you.

3727
02:33:05.841 --> 02:33:07.197
You can feel the heat,

3728
02:33:07.197 --> 02:33:08.459
and the moorbounders are a little bit reticent

3729
02:33:08.459 --> 02:33:11.016
to move forward, but you usher them through.

3730
02:33:11.016 --> 02:33:13.617
As you look up, particularly Caduceus

3731
02:33:13.617 --> 02:33:17.284
and we'll say Beauregard, Caleb, and Jester,

3732
02:33:19.756 --> 02:33:21.814
you guys can see the clusters of eyes

3733
02:33:21.814 --> 02:33:24.769
reflecting the flames in them as they're about

3734
02:33:24.769 --> 02:33:28.582
15 feet above you. Elements, yeah, of the--

3735
02:33:28.582 --> 02:33:32.341
LAURA: Stop it.
TALIESIN: Hey.

3736
02:33:32.341 --> 02:33:33.736
Have a nice day.

3737
02:33:33.736 --> 02:33:35.340
MATT: Continuing to move forward.

3738
02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:38.204
Eventually, climbing through the web-infested forest,

3739
02:33:38.204 --> 02:33:40.448
the deep aspect of these woods,

3740
02:33:40.448 --> 02:33:42.687
you come to the base of the Penumbra Range,

3741
02:33:42.687 --> 02:33:44.972
the ominous mountains, steep as they climb

3742
02:33:44.972 --> 02:33:47.710
from the floor, sculpted by the elements

3743
02:33:47.710 --> 02:33:51.836
to resemble jagged stairs for an impossibly large behemoth.

3744
02:33:51.836 --> 02:33:54.409
The clusters of the Vermaloc trees protrude

3745
02:33:54.409 --> 02:33:56.366
from pockets of earth that appear to be wedged

3746
02:33:56.366 --> 02:34:00.679
or have found purchase within these somewhat

3747
02:34:00.679 --> 02:34:02.512
shifty mountain bases.

3748
02:34:04.194 --> 02:34:06.889
You can see bits of color against the darker stone,

3749
02:34:06.889 --> 02:34:09.347
as these trees have found really still on the base

3750
02:34:09.347 --> 02:34:11.764
elements where they can grow.

3751
02:34:13.945 --> 02:34:18.945
Caduceus, you notice before

3752
02:34:19.224 --> 02:34:21.462
Soorna points in that direction,

3753
02:34:21.462 --> 02:34:23.377
that following the shapes of the range,

3754
02:34:23.377 --> 02:34:26.534
you can see hidden slopes that wind up the side.

3755
02:34:26.534 --> 02:34:29.137
Your eyes catch the mouth of a divide,

3756
02:34:29.137 --> 02:34:32.833
about a quarter mile up.

3757
02:34:32.833 --> 02:34:35.697
In the side of the cliff,

3758
02:34:35.697 --> 02:34:38.438
you can see an element where this cleft exists

3759
02:34:38.438 --> 02:34:40.438
and pushes into the mountain,

3760
02:34:40.438 --> 02:34:43.376
and there's a small, shallow ravine

3761
02:34:43.376 --> 02:34:46.749
that's out of sight beyond the angle you're looking.

3762
02:34:46.749 --> 02:34:48.121
As you take notice and begin to point,

3763
02:34:48.121 --> 02:34:50.744
Soorna goes and gestures to the staff up.

3764
02:34:50.744 --> 02:34:52.844
TALIESIN: Hey, look at that.

3765
02:34:55.175 --> 02:34:56.588
Going that way.

3766
02:34:56.588 --> 02:34:58.908
MATT: As you follow Soorna up these hidden, switchback paths

3767
02:34:58.908 --> 02:35:00.849
up the side of the mountain,

3768
02:35:00.849 --> 02:35:03.469
the temperature grows colder.

3769
02:35:03.469 --> 02:35:05.505
It's not raining, but you can see storm clouds

3770
02:35:05.505 --> 02:35:07.040
beginning to come and mount.

3771
02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:08.481
The sky starts growing darker.

3772
02:35:08.481 --> 02:35:11.438
The rain is going to be probably a heavy rain,

3773
02:35:11.438 --> 02:35:14.241
and for the next day or two.

3774
02:35:14.241 --> 02:35:16.060
You can see the dark storm clouds

3775
02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:18.102
go on and on endlessly,

3776
02:35:18.102 --> 02:35:22.385
so you think you're in for a wet week to come.

3777
02:35:22.385 --> 02:35:24.705
TALIESIN: Fancy jacket helps.

3778
02:35:24.705 --> 02:35:26.239
MATT: Stepping up towards the gap in the cliff,

3779
02:35:26.239 --> 02:35:28.316
you can already see the small canyon

3780
02:35:28.316 --> 02:35:30.958
that's nestled in the mountainside

3781
02:35:30.958 --> 02:35:35.958
has built within it this alcove, front of a fortress,

3782
02:35:36.305 --> 02:35:39.260
of rough slabs and placed stones.

3783
02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:41.601
The design for beings far larger than you.

3784
02:35:41.601 --> 02:35:44.844
The sides of it have decorations of tattered leather

3785
02:35:44.844 --> 02:35:49.011
and sculpted bone that frame the interior.

3786
02:35:50.741 --> 02:35:53.004
Each side of the stronghold embeds itself

3787
02:35:53.004 --> 02:35:54.637
into the side of the wall of the mountain.

3788
02:35:54.637 --> 02:35:55.663
It seems shallow.

3789
02:35:55.663 --> 02:35:56.982
Even at first glance,

3790
02:35:56.982 --> 02:35:58.784
it's either a very small stronghold,

3791
02:35:58.784 --> 02:36:00.921
or a portion of it is built further

3792
02:36:00.921 --> 02:36:03.484
into the actual mountain.

3793
02:36:03.484 --> 02:36:07.424
The front doorway stands about 20 feet tall,

3794
02:36:07.424 --> 02:36:10.041
it's wide open.

3795
02:36:10.041 --> 02:36:15.041
You can already see amongst this area,

3796
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:17.548
stains across the stone here:

3797
02:36:17.548 --> 02:36:21.740
smattered, dark, dried blood.

3798
02:36:22.983 --> 02:36:25.361
As you begin to step into the ravine

3799
02:36:25.361 --> 02:36:29.995
and head towards the front of this stronghold, it's quiet.

3800
02:36:29.995 --> 02:36:31.452
The wind picks up a bit,

3801
02:36:31.452 --> 02:36:33.153
(whooshing) and blows through.

3802
02:36:33.153 --> 02:36:34.876
The chill creeps across you,

3803
02:36:34.876 --> 02:36:36.438
and you feel the hair on the back

3804
02:36:36.438 --> 02:36:38.771
of your neck stand up a bit.

3805
02:36:39.915 --> 02:36:44.033
Soorna is moving forward, but with hesitance,

3806
02:36:44.033 --> 02:36:46.417
and with each step she's having to

3807
02:36:46.417 --> 02:36:50.991
steel her will and take another, and another.

3808
02:36:50.991 --> 02:36:53.082
What's your marching order, guys?

3809
02:36:53.082 --> 02:36:55.216
LAURA: Oy vey.
LIAM: Mage Armor, now.

3810
02:36:55.216 --> 02:36:56.049
MATT: Okay, Mage Armor is up.

3811
02:36:56.049 --> 02:36:57.507
MARISHA: Yeah, and before we go in,

3812
02:36:57.507 --> 02:37:02.507
Caduceus, there seems to be some sort of undead connotation

3813
02:37:02.536 --> 02:37:05.738
things going on here.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3814
02:37:05.738 --> 02:37:07.046
MARISHA: Is there something we can do

3815
02:37:07.046 --> 02:37:08.892
to prevent against that?

3816
02:37:08.892 --> 02:37:12.976
TALIESIN: I can help a little bit, but I don't know.

3817
02:37:12.976 --> 02:37:17.801
MARISHA: There's also a lot of piercing imagery.

3818
02:37:18.898 --> 02:37:19.880
I don't know if there's anything

3819
02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:21.564
to resist against that, either?

3820
02:37:21.564 --> 02:37:24.366
TRAVIS: Is there still a shit load of spiderwebs everywhere?

3821
02:37:24.366 --> 02:37:27.747
MATT: No, those dissipated with the forest, thankfully.

3822
02:37:27.747 --> 02:37:30.300
TRAVIS: We're home free.

3823
02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:33.203
LIAM: Improvisation is key, but Caduceus,

3824
02:37:33.203 --> 02:37:35.443
I think in here, you're the point person.

3825
02:37:35.443 --> 02:37:37.000
We will all look to you.

3826
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.862
TALIESIN: All right.

3827
02:37:38.862 --> 02:37:41.560
I'm looking at a couple things.

3828
02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:42.715
SAM: Marching order, you said?

3829
02:37:42.715 --> 02:37:44.456
MATT: Yes.

3830
02:37:44.456 --> 02:37:46.206
TRAVIS: I'll go first.

3831
02:37:46.206 --> 02:37:47.843
LIAM: I'll go last.

3832
02:37:47.843 --> 02:37:50.126
ASHLEY: Are we all following Soorna?

3833
02:37:50.126 --> 02:37:51.646
MATT: The giant is flanking alongside,

3834
02:37:51.646 --> 02:37:55.006
but is also letting you guys go a little bit ahead, as well.

3835
02:37:55.006 --> 02:37:57.220
ASHLEY: I'll go up next.
MATT: After Fjord?

3836
02:37:57.220 --> 02:37:58.286
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: I'll watch for you.

3837
02:37:58.286 --> 02:38:00.239
TALIESIN: I'd like to be next to you, if that's all right?

3838
02:38:00.239 --> 02:38:02.415
MARISHA: I'll go up front with Caduceus after that.

3839
02:38:02.415 --> 02:38:03.982
MATT: Okay, so you guys are behind them?

3840
02:38:03.982 --> 02:38:05.703
TALIESIN: Yeah, right there.
LAURA: I guess I'll stick back

3841
02:38:05.703 --> 02:38:07.144
with Nott and Caleb, then.

3842
02:38:07.144 --> 02:38:08.663
MATT: Okay, Nott, are you holding up the rear?

3843
02:38:08.663 --> 02:38:11.768
SAM: I'll hold up the rear and cast Mage Hand.

3844
02:38:11.768 --> 02:38:15.646
MATT: Okay, so you have your Mage Hand in front of you.

3845
02:38:15.646 --> 02:38:18.627
TALIESIN: Seeing if there's anything we should have.

3846
02:38:18.627 --> 02:38:20.867
MATT: Any other spells or anything

3847
02:38:20.867 --> 02:38:23.475
you need to prepare in advance?

3848
02:38:23.475 --> 02:38:25.470
TALIESIN: Just looking.

3849
02:38:25.470 --> 02:38:29.048
LIAML Fireball on the party.

3850
02:38:29.048 --> 02:38:30.568
MATT: I knew I could count on you.

3851
02:38:30.568 --> 02:38:32.402
SAM: Every three episodes.

3852
02:38:32.402 --> 02:38:33.470
MATT: He gets a little itchy

3853
02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:34.928
and has to blow his friends up.

3854
02:38:34.928 --> 02:38:36.172
LIAM: (grunting)

3855
02:38:36.172 --> 02:38:37.505
TRAVIS: Fucking Caleb!

3856
02:38:38.658 --> 02:38:40.624
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's no, nothing.

3857
02:38:40.624 --> 02:38:43.025
I got a thing that I'll cast if we get into trouble,

3858
02:38:43.025 --> 02:38:46.465
but I'm paying very close attention

3859
02:38:46.465 --> 02:38:51.324
and I'm going to occasionally do a little Detect Undead.

3860
02:38:52.225 --> 02:38:54.145
I'm going to run Eyes of the Grave every now and then.

3861
02:38:54.145 --> 02:38:56.603
I'm certainly stepping in,

3862
02:38:56.603 --> 02:38:59.425
I want to right when we start stepping in,

3863
02:38:59.425 --> 02:39:00.801
I want to cast Eyes of the Grave,

3864
02:39:00.801 --> 02:39:02.459
just to take a gander.

3865
02:39:02.459 --> 02:39:03.419
MATT: Okay.

3866
02:39:03.419 --> 02:39:05.651
TALIESIN: Poop.

3867
02:39:05.651 --> 02:39:06.484
LAURA: Did you say poop?

3868
02:39:06.484 --> 02:39:07.377
TALIESIN: I did.

3869
02:39:07.377 --> 02:39:09.271
It's the sound of popping on Eyes of the Grave.

3870
02:39:09.271 --> 02:39:10.315
LAURA: Oh, okay.
MATT: As you step

3871
02:39:10.315 --> 02:39:15.315
on the threshold of the main chamber doorway,

3872
02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:19.262
the first thing that gets you is the scent.

3873
02:39:19.262 --> 02:39:20.753
It grabs your senses immediately.

3874
02:39:20.753 --> 02:39:22.532
It's like bile and rot.

3875
02:39:22.532 --> 02:39:23.871
LAURA: Ew.

3876
02:39:23.871 --> 02:39:25.671
MATT: You can see more dark stains

3877
02:39:25.671 --> 02:39:27.412
across the stone floor ahead of you

3878
02:39:27.412 --> 02:39:29.754
along with small piles of drying, organic matter.

3879
02:39:29.754 --> 02:39:33.898
LAURA: Somebody's been eating spider legs.

3880
02:39:33.898 --> 02:39:36.857
MATT: The antechamber is quite large.

3881
02:39:39.043 --> 02:39:41.884
In fact, let me show you.

3882
02:39:41.884 --> 02:39:46.184
SAM: This battle is brought to you by,

3883
02:39:46.184 --> 02:39:49.164
this combat is powered by Dwarven Forge!

3884
02:39:49.164 --> 02:39:51.139
LIAM: Haggle flaggle!

3885
02:39:51.139 --> 02:39:54.739
SAM: There's a PDF module tied to their Dungeons of Doom

3886
02:39:54.739 --> 02:39:57.261
product available now on their website.

3887
02:39:57.261 --> 02:39:59.181
I don't know if I'm supposed to do this every time,

3888
02:39:59.181 --> 02:40:00.793
but guys, there's some sort of battle cam

3889
02:40:00.793 --> 02:40:02.813
that's supposed to do amazing.

3890
02:40:02.813 --> 02:40:04.568
I've never actually seen it.

3891
02:40:04.568 --> 02:40:05.747
MARISHA: It's definitely--it's great!

3892
02:40:05.747 --> 02:40:07.067
LIAM: Oh, what?

3893
02:40:07.067 --> 02:40:08.875
TRAVIS: (imitating dramatic music)

3894
02:40:08.875 --> 02:40:09.708
LAURA: Pass this around.

3895
02:40:09.708 --> 02:40:11.178
LIAM: That's not wood!

3896
02:40:11.178 --> 02:40:13.603
SAM: Oh man, do we have to drink this?

3897
02:40:13.603 --> 02:40:15.011
TALIESIN: No, somebody ordered these.

3898
02:40:15.011 --> 02:40:15.844
SAM: I know, but do we have to--

3899
02:40:15.844 --> 02:40:17.235
MATT: I don't know why they brought them in now.

3900
02:40:17.235 --> 02:40:19.022
TALIESIN: I don't know, either.

3901
02:40:19.022 --> 02:40:21.939
LIAM: We ordered shakes from nobody in particular.

3902
02:40:23.215 --> 02:40:25.855
MATT: All right, well, they're out here now.

3903
02:40:25.855 --> 02:40:27.582
LIAM: No one in particular.
MARISHA: This is the best.

3904
02:40:27.582 --> 02:40:29.208
MATT: Cool, well, okay.
MARISHA: Spoons!

3905
02:40:29.208 --> 02:40:30.442
MATT: I did not mean to throw this chaos

3906
02:40:30.442 --> 02:40:33.026
into you in the middle of the game, but here we are.

3907
02:40:33.026 --> 02:40:34.445
This was for after the stream.

3908
02:40:34.445 --> 02:40:35.278
All right, so.

3909
02:40:35.278 --> 02:40:36.421
TRAVIS: Put that shit down.

3910
02:40:36.421 --> 02:40:39.024
TALIESIN: That's not mine. Oh god, it's everywhere.

3911
02:40:39.024 --> 02:40:40.664
MATT: Entering the main chamber.

3912
02:40:40.664 --> 02:40:41.689
TALIESIN: Oh no.

3913
02:40:41.689 --> 02:40:42.913
LIAM: We'll have a bonus one.

3914
02:40:42.913 --> 02:40:45.866
TALIESIN: There's one underneath here.

3915
02:40:45.866 --> 02:40:47.546
SAM: Oh shit, we're in a chamber?

3916
02:40:47.546 --> 02:40:48.943
Oh god!
MATT: This is the front door

3917
02:40:48.943 --> 02:40:50.362
you guys came here through.

3918
02:40:50.362 --> 02:40:52.695
LIAM: No one has ever done that.

3919
02:40:54.859 --> 02:40:56.416
LAURA: Oh my god.

3920
02:40:56.416 --> 02:40:57.361
LIAM: We're cool, we're cool.

3921
02:40:57.361 --> 02:40:58.194
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

3922
02:40:58.194 --> 02:41:00.269
TALIESIN: There are stairs.

3923
02:41:01.231 --> 02:41:02.692
MATT: This is a pile of stones.

3924
02:41:02.692 --> 02:41:03.525
TALIESIN: Okay.

3925
02:41:03.525 --> 02:41:04.713
MATT: This is a one story structure.

3926
02:41:04.713 --> 02:41:05.546
TALIESIN: Okay, there's nothing--

3927
02:41:05.546 --> 02:41:08.348
MATT: The ceiling stands about 25 feet tall.

3928
02:41:08.348 --> 02:41:10.955
LIAM: This is incorrect. Nott goes in front of the coward.

3929
02:41:10.955 --> 02:41:12.470
SAM: No, I said I was in the rear.

3930
02:41:12.470 --> 02:41:13.683
MATT: He said he was in the back.

3931
02:41:13.683 --> 02:41:14.766
LIAM: I said I was in the back.

3932
02:41:14.766 --> 02:41:16.800
You want to argue about it?
TRAVIS: Ro-sham-bo!

3933
02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:19.053
Boulder, Parchment, Shears!

3934
02:41:19.053 --> 02:41:21.641
LIAM and SAM: One, two, three, shoot, oh.

3935
02:41:21.641 --> 02:41:22.694
No, one, two, three, shoot.

3936
02:41:22.694 --> 02:41:23.831
Ready?
SAM: I thought you want to?

3937
02:41:23.831 --> 02:41:25.550
TRAVIS, SAM, and LIAM: One, two, three, shoot.

3938
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:27.796
One, two, three, shoot.

3939
02:41:27.796 --> 02:41:28.629
TRAVIS: Jesus.

3940
02:41:28.629 --> 02:41:29.472
TRAVIS, SAM, and LIAM: One, two, three, shoot.

3941
02:41:29.472 --> 02:41:32.141
LIAM: Goddamn it.

3942
02:41:32.141 --> 02:41:35.174
Okay, fine, I'm so brave.

3943
02:41:35.174 --> 02:41:36.493
There.
TALIESIN: It's good to have

3944
02:41:36.493 --> 02:41:37.739
someone behind you.

3945
02:41:37.739 --> 02:41:38.572
LAURA: Don't worry, Caleb,

3946
02:41:38.572 --> 02:41:39.405
I'll protect you.

3947
02:41:39.405 --> 02:41:43.187
TALIESIN: So Soorna, is there any

3948
02:41:43.187 --> 02:41:44.686
hidden contraptions

3949
02:41:44.686 --> 02:41:47.136
or anything we should be aware of in here?

3950
02:41:47.136 --> 02:41:48.838
MATT: Soorna, whose eyes are looking up

3951
02:41:48.838 --> 02:41:50.576
into the darkened hallway ahead,

3952
02:41:50.576 --> 02:41:53.738
which continues onward lightlessly.

3953
02:41:53.738 --> 02:41:54.797
TALIESIN: This is going to be my first,

3954
02:41:54.797 --> 02:41:57.779
this would have been my first use of Eyes of the Grave.

3955
02:41:57.779 --> 02:41:58.612
MATT: Okay, which has a range of?

3956
02:41:58.612 --> 02:42:00.707
TALIESIN: 60 feet.
MATT: 60 feet?

3957
02:42:00.707 --> 02:42:04.548
Nothing catches to your attention.

3958
02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:09.132
Soorna, looking ahead, this hallway, eyes wide and focused.

3959
02:42:09.132 --> 02:42:12.675
You can see the fear around the eyes.

3960
02:42:12.675 --> 02:42:15.087
Did you just get brain freeze, Sam?

3961
02:42:15.087 --> 02:42:17.741
SAM: Yep.
MATT: Aw, buddy.

3962
02:42:17.741 --> 02:42:18.856
SAM: Okay, it's gone. All right.

3963
02:42:18.856 --> 02:42:21.356
TALIESIN: It'll be back.

3964
02:42:21.356 --> 02:42:24.352
MATT: She leans off to the side.

3965
02:42:25.615 --> 02:42:27.948
"There are no traps."

3966
02:42:29.485 --> 02:42:31.456
TALIESIN: No way in or out?

3967
02:42:31.456 --> 02:42:32.908
MATT: "It's just the way in."

3968
02:42:32.908 --> 02:42:34.032
TALIESIN: All right.

3969
02:42:34.032 --> 02:42:35.152
TRAVIS: Can you ask her how far she got

3970
02:42:35.152 --> 02:42:39.808
before stuff went down last time?

3971
02:42:39.808 --> 02:42:42.884
TALIESIN: I think they made it.

3972
02:42:42.884 --> 02:42:44.832
Did they make it this far last time?

3973
02:42:44.832 --> 02:42:46.491
Were you still fighting them here?

3974
02:42:46.491 --> 02:42:48.491
MATT: "Oh, when I returned, we didn't even enter.

3975
02:42:48.491 --> 02:42:49.711
"They were standing at the door.

3976
02:42:49.711 --> 02:42:51.377
"The fact that they're not

3977
02:42:51.377 --> 02:42:53.387
"in this chamber makes me uneasy."

3978
02:42:53.387 --> 02:42:56.267
TRAVIS: Darkvision of 60 feet, can I see anything?

3979
02:42:56.267 --> 02:43:00.347
MATT: Correct, so 60 feet you can see a hall

3980
02:43:00.347 --> 02:43:02.186
that continues onward.

3981
02:43:02.186 --> 02:43:06.944
From your position, you can see a basin of some kind.

3982
02:43:06.944 --> 02:43:08.891
The chamber goes to the right and the left.

3983
02:43:08.891 --> 02:43:11.008
TRAVIS: A basin? Oh, okay.

3984
02:43:11.008 --> 02:43:12.229
SAM: There's a fountain-y thing over there.

3985
02:43:12.229 --> 02:43:14.667
TRAVIS: It looks like there's a little T,

3986
02:43:14.667 --> 02:43:16.209
or a little cross junction.

3987
02:43:16.209 --> 02:43:17.266
LIAM: Hold on a second.

3988
02:43:17.266 --> 02:43:18.433
(snapping)

3989
02:43:18.433 --> 02:43:20.299
Frumpkin is on the ground.

3990
02:43:20.299 --> 02:43:22.314
MATT: Okay.

3991
02:43:23.197 --> 02:43:24.364
LIAM: I pull--

3992
02:43:24.364 --> 02:43:25.276
MATT: The Frumpkin figure

3993
02:43:25.276 --> 02:43:27.621
got somehow smashed.
LIAM: Don't tell me that.

3994
02:43:27.621 --> 02:43:29.906
TALIESIN: Flat Frumpkin!
LIAM: Don't tell me that.

3995
02:43:29.906 --> 02:43:31.548
TALIESIN: Let's also, where does everybody, how--

3996
02:43:31.548 --> 02:43:34.008
LIAM: I'm going to TPK this entire table.

3997
02:43:34.008 --> 02:43:35.249
TALIESIN: Question, question.

3998
02:43:35.249 --> 02:43:38.033
Do we want to unclump into two groups?

3999
02:43:38.033 --> 02:43:38.941
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4000
02:43:38.941 --> 02:43:39.928
LIAM: Sure, that's a good idea.

4001
02:43:39.928 --> 02:43:41.329
MATT: We'll say your dancing lights is Frumpkin.

4002
02:43:41.329 --> 02:43:42.245
LIAM: That's perfect.

4003
02:43:42.245 --> 02:43:43.409
MATT: This is your Mage Hand.

4004
02:43:43.409 --> 02:43:46.290
TALIESIN: Let's unclump maybe very quietly.

4005
02:43:46.290 --> 02:43:47.826
LAURA: Yeah, let's spread out.

4006
02:43:47.826 --> 02:43:51.090
TALIESIN: One group in this little chunk's one group,

4007
02:43:51.090 --> 02:43:52.386
just over to the right of the door.

4008
02:43:52.386 --> 02:43:53.219
SAM: We're just going to split.

4009
02:43:53.219 --> 02:43:54.493
LAURA: Split down the middle.

4010
02:43:54.493 --> 02:43:56.509
TRAVIS: Over to your left, Matt.

4011
02:43:56.509 --> 02:43:57.965
MATT: Going this way?
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

4012
02:43:57.965 --> 02:43:59.325
MATT: Moving forward?
LAURA: No, no, no.

4013
02:43:59.325 --> 02:44:01.224
Just over to there.

4014
02:44:01.224 --> 02:44:02.057
TALIESIN: If things happen,

4015
02:44:02.057 --> 02:44:04.045
we're not in a big spray arc, yeah.

4016
02:44:04.045 --> 02:44:06.113
MATT: You got it.
LIAM: In this moment, then,

4017
02:44:06.113 --> 02:44:08.353
I'm going to plant my hand in the center

4018
02:44:08.353 --> 02:44:10.614
of the shoulder blades of Caduceus,

4019
02:44:10.614 --> 02:44:12.236
since he is the leader here,

4020
02:44:12.236 --> 02:44:13.921
and--oh, but before that,

4021
02:44:13.921 --> 02:44:16.504
I pull, because I always have mud in my pockets,

4022
02:44:16.504 --> 02:44:18.246
I grab Frumpkin,

4023
02:44:18.246 --> 02:44:21.456
and I smear it all over him

4024
02:44:21.456 --> 02:44:24.665
to make him look like a disgusting, ratty creature.

4025
02:44:24.665 --> 02:44:26.644
MATT: Frumpkin does not appreciate it.

4026
02:44:26.644 --> 02:44:28.221
LIAM: Telepathically.

4027
02:44:28.221 --> 02:44:30.286
MATT: (meowing)

4028
02:44:30.286 --> 02:44:33.426
LIAM: Buddy boy, go look around, do your thing.

4029
02:44:33.426 --> 02:44:35.686
I put my hand on Caduceus' back,

4030
02:44:35.686 --> 02:44:38.580
and I can't hear or see anything. I am Frumpkin.

4031
02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:40.923
I send him walking in.

4032
02:44:40.923 --> 02:44:42.982
MATT: Okay, roll a perception check with disadvantage.

4033
02:44:42.982 --> 02:44:45.836
LIAM: Yeah, veering to the left.

4034
02:44:45.836 --> 02:44:48.342
Disadvantage.

4035
02:44:48.342 --> 02:44:49.175
(scoffs)

4036
02:44:49.175 --> 02:44:50.008
Goddamn it!

4037
02:44:50.008 --> 02:44:52.914
They were the opposite of the die!

4038
02:44:54.698 --> 02:44:55.531
Six.

4039
02:44:55.531 --> 02:44:58.289
MATT: Okay, Frumpkin turns the corner. It's fairly dark.

4040
02:44:58.289 --> 02:45:00.000
What you do see in the chamber,

4041
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:01.980
it appears to be a crafting room of some kind.

4042
02:45:01.980 --> 02:45:05.941
There are large tools. There's a large table

4043
02:45:05.941 --> 02:45:08.570
that has some materials used

4044
02:45:08.570 --> 02:45:11.793
for stone crafting and stone cutting.

4045
02:45:11.793 --> 02:45:16.201
You do see on the floor,

4046
02:45:16.201 --> 02:45:19.526
a skeletal corpse over here

4047
02:45:20.518 --> 02:45:22.675
of a stone giant that is mostly bone.

4048
02:45:22.675 --> 02:45:25.077
It has been picked clean of most of its meat.

4049
02:45:25.077 --> 02:45:27.883
There are piles of whatever organs and stuff

4050
02:45:27.883 --> 02:45:29.120
might still remain.

4051
02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:30.304
Shreds of it left over

4052
02:45:30.304 --> 02:45:32.422
have fallen through and sloughed off the skeleton

4053
02:45:32.422 --> 02:45:34.822
and came to in a pile there.

4054
02:45:34.822 --> 02:45:36.683
That's what Frumpkin sees.

4055
02:45:36.683 --> 02:45:38.749
LIAM: I whisper to Caduceus:

4056
02:45:38.749 --> 02:45:41.457
Tell your big friend

4057
02:45:41.457 --> 02:45:45.023
that one of her family is

4058
02:45:45.023 --> 02:45:47.504
very dead ahead.

4059
02:45:47.504 --> 02:45:49.504
TALIESIN: One of your people is,

4060
02:45:52.604 --> 02:45:56.304
dead in the crafting room in the room to the left.

4061
02:45:56.304 --> 02:45:58.137
Very dead, apparently.

4062
02:45:59.366 --> 02:46:01.824
MATT: "Appreciate the information."

4063
02:46:01.824 --> 02:46:03.227
TALIESIN: There's one.

4064
02:46:03.227 --> 02:46:06.902
LIAM: If Frumpkin has done his best to look around the room,

4065
02:46:06.902 --> 02:46:11.902
I would command him to cross the hallway.

4066
02:46:12.464 --> 02:46:13.781
MATT: Roll another perception check with disadvantage.

4067
02:46:13.781 --> 02:46:15.622
TRAVIS: Didn't the dead come back to play?

4068
02:46:15.622 --> 02:46:17.564
TALIESIN: Sometimes.

4069
02:46:18.952 --> 02:46:20.618
LIAM: Same two rolls.

4070
02:46:20.618 --> 02:46:23.608
Both times, I rolled a 17 and a two.

4071
02:46:23.608 --> 02:46:25.048
That's a six.
SAM: In that order.

4072
02:46:25.048 --> 02:46:26.734
LIAM: In that order, right.

4073
02:46:26.734 --> 02:46:27.932
MATT: Buddy.

4074
02:46:27.932 --> 02:46:30.220
Frumpkin looks inside here.

4075
02:46:30.220 --> 02:46:31.053
LIAM: My cat.

4076
02:46:31.053 --> 02:46:32.771
SAM: Huh, that's so sweet.

4077
02:46:32.771 --> 02:46:33.944
LIAM: Oh, it's a sandbox.

4078
02:46:33.944 --> 02:46:35.808
MATT: The best that Frumpkin sees, a few shapes.

4079
02:46:35.808 --> 02:46:39.939
Large, stone tables of some kind.

4080
02:46:39.939 --> 02:46:42.146
There is a heavy pit across the way

4081
02:46:42.146 --> 02:46:46.140
that drops out of sight there.

4082
02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:51.114
You see another corpse

4083
02:46:51.114 --> 02:46:53.455
in the corner there.

4084
02:46:53.455 --> 02:46:56.300
SAM: That's fine, they're dead. What can they do?

4085
02:46:56.300 --> 02:46:57.324
TALIESIN: A lot.

4086
02:46:57.324 --> 02:47:02.183
LIAM: I tell Frumpkin to look at the ceiling.

4087
02:47:02.183 --> 02:47:07.183
MATT: Okay, Frumpkin looks up, doesn't see anything.

4088
02:47:07.420 --> 02:47:10.070
TRAVIS: How high is it?

4089
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:11.004
MATT: The ceiling's about 30 feet up.

4090
02:47:11.004 --> 02:47:12.214
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

4091
02:47:12.214 --> 02:47:13.368
MATT: 25 to 30 feet.

4092
02:47:13.368 --> 02:47:16.791
LIAM: I tell Frumpkin to go up to the pool,

4093
02:47:16.791 --> 02:47:19.916
and dab the water.

4094
02:47:19.916 --> 02:47:21.292
MATT: It's not water.

4095
02:47:21.292 --> 02:47:22.354
Frumpkin goes up to the edge

4096
02:47:22.354 --> 02:47:23.628
and can now have a better view.

4097
02:47:23.628 --> 02:47:25.906
Looking inside, what little bit of light

4098
02:47:25.906 --> 02:47:30.226
that Frumpkin has here without darkvision, it's a pit.

4099
02:47:30.226 --> 02:47:35.226
It's a pit that goes far lower where Frumpkin can see.

4100
02:47:35.442 --> 02:47:37.367
Frumpkin does not have darkvision if I'm correct, correct?

4101
02:47:37.367 --> 02:47:38.578
If I remember correctly.
LIAM: I will check,

4102
02:47:38.578 --> 02:47:41.892
but I snap my fingers and bamf him out of there.

4103
02:47:41.892 --> 02:47:43.865
MATT: Okay, double checking.

4104
02:47:43.865 --> 02:47:45.063
Cats are nocturnal.

4105
02:47:45.063 --> 02:47:46.316
LIAM: Creature's in there.

4106
02:47:46.316 --> 02:47:48.361
Creature, cat.

4107
02:47:48.361 --> 02:47:49.580
TALIESIN: Bless you.

4108
02:47:49.580 --> 02:47:53.258
LIAM: Keen smell, it says nothing about vision in there.

4109
02:47:53.258 --> 02:47:57.514
MATT: Correct, so Frumpkin definitely can smell rot

4110
02:47:57.514 --> 02:48:01.247
from that pit, some of it old, old rot.

4111
02:48:01.247 --> 02:48:03.532
Like that came from a long time ago.

4112
02:48:03.532 --> 02:48:06.202
MATT: Okay, then I would, to my group at least,

4113
02:48:06.202 --> 02:48:08.818
quietly say that there's two chambers,

4114
02:48:08.818 --> 02:48:13.392
seemingly nothing alive, and a hole to the right.

4115
02:48:13.392 --> 02:48:14.867
TALIESIN: There's a large hole

4116
02:48:14.867 --> 02:48:17.095
and there are two bodies, though.

4117
02:48:17.095 --> 02:48:19.737
Bodies are dangerous.

4118
02:48:19.737 --> 02:48:22.533
ASHLEY: Are they dead or are they sleeping?

4119
02:48:22.533 --> 02:48:25.383
LIAM: I believe they're, yeah, Frumpkin's gone.

4120
02:48:25.383 --> 02:48:28.476
I took him out of the existence entirely.

4121
02:48:28.476 --> 02:48:29.724
SAM: Let's go investigate

4122
02:48:29.724 --> 02:48:33.876
these corpses. How about the dead-er one?

4123
02:48:33.876 --> 02:48:35.895
TALIESIN: Is there a dead-er one?

4124
02:48:35.895 --> 02:48:39.693
LIAM: They are equally dead as far as I could tell, Nott.

4125
02:48:39.693 --> 02:48:41.183
MATT: This one is very skeletal.

4126
02:48:41.183 --> 02:48:43.154
This one, from what Frumpkin can see, also is dead,

4127
02:48:43.154 --> 02:48:44.332
but didn't get quite the same bead,

4128
02:48:44.332 --> 02:48:46.039
because he didn't get all the way up to it.

4129
02:48:46.039 --> 02:48:47.038
SAM: The skeleton one.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4130
02:48:47.038 --> 02:48:49.336
TRAVIS: Okay.

4131
02:48:49.336 --> 02:48:52.161
SAM: Party on the left will start moseying around.

4132
02:48:52.161 --> 02:48:54.481
TRAVIS: Party on the right will go to the right.

4133
02:48:54.481 --> 02:48:55.761
TALIESIN: Once I am within view of the body,

4134
02:48:55.761 --> 02:49:00.719
I'm also going to do another detect,

4135
02:49:02.359 --> 02:49:05.344
another Eyes of the Grave.

4136
02:49:05.344 --> 02:49:07.119
MATT: Are you bringing your Mage Hand with you?

4137
02:49:07.119 --> 02:49:10.144
SAM: I will. I'll probably recast it.

4138
02:49:10.144 --> 02:49:11.042
It's probably been a minute.

4139
02:49:11.042 --> 02:49:13.901
TALIESIN: Is she hanging back, or?

4140
02:49:13.901 --> 02:49:15.485
MATT: Who's hanging back?
TALIESIN: She is, okay.

4141
02:49:15.485 --> 02:49:16.365
No, I mean is she?

4142
02:49:16.365 --> 02:49:18.717
SAM: Big girl.
ASHLEY: Soorna.

4143
02:49:18.717 --> 02:49:21.024
MATT: Soorna is approaching and--

4144
02:49:21.024 --> 02:49:22.144
TALIESIN: Gently.
MATT: Yeah.

4145
02:49:22.144 --> 02:49:22.977
Soorna is with you,

4146
02:49:22.977 --> 02:49:25.424
but Soorna also, honestly, is keeping you guys

4147
02:49:25.424 --> 02:49:27.248
between you and whatever might be there.

4148
02:49:27.248 --> 02:49:28.723
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4149
02:49:28.723 --> 02:49:30.739
MATT: She's not a frontline tank from her perspective,

4150
02:49:30.739 --> 02:49:32.363
and honestly, the reason she's here

4151
02:49:32.363 --> 02:49:34.801
is she believes that you're going to prove yourselves

4152
02:49:34.801 --> 02:49:36.726
by helping and being a buffer to whatever is--

4153
02:49:36.726 --> 02:49:38.244
you can see the fear in her eyes,

4154
02:49:38.244 --> 02:49:40.621
causing that look of dread.

4155
02:49:40.621 --> 02:49:43.382
TALIESIN: All right, once I can see both of the,

4156
02:49:43.382 --> 02:49:46.001
once I'm within range of these two bodies,

4157
02:49:46.001 --> 02:49:46.834
I'm going to--
MATT: Okay,

4158
02:49:46.834 --> 02:49:48.475
were you inspecting this one here?

4159
02:49:48.475 --> 02:49:51.573
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a quick Eyes of the Grave,

4160
02:49:51.573 --> 02:49:54.231
just to see, and then do little look around quickly.

4161
02:49:54.231 --> 02:49:56.234
60 feet, anything undead should light up.

4162
02:49:56.234 --> 02:49:58.691
MATT: Right, so when you're close to this point,

4163
02:49:58.691 --> 02:50:02.539
Eyes of the Grave, nothing catches your attention.

4164
02:50:02.539 --> 02:50:04.598
Make a perception check.

4165
02:50:04.598 --> 02:50:05.898
SAM: Oh boy.

4166
02:50:06.785 --> 02:50:09.083
TRAVIS: Come on!

4167
02:50:09.083 --> 02:50:13.053
TALIESIN: That's good, that's 25.

4168
02:50:13.053 --> 02:50:15.533
MATT: Great, there is no light source here

4169
02:50:15.533 --> 02:50:16.957
and you do not have darkvision.

4170
02:50:16.957 --> 02:50:19.197
ASHLEY: I have darkvision.

4171
02:50:19.197 --> 02:50:20.856
MATT: Yasha does, so Yasha glances there

4172
02:50:20.856 --> 02:50:22.573
and you both see this first.

4173
02:50:22.573 --> 02:50:25.634
That pile of flesh that's sloughed to the ground,

4174
02:50:25.634 --> 02:50:27.842
there's a slight bit of movement. You hear--

4175
02:50:27.842 --> 02:50:31.658
TALIESIN: It's not setting off Eyes of the Grave?

4176
02:50:31.658 --> 02:50:33.970
MATT: No, and you hear this scraping sound.

4177
02:50:33.970 --> 02:50:36.133
TALIESIN: I'm backing up a little bit.

4178
02:50:36.133 --> 02:50:38.294
MATT: As you guys notice, you can see three figures

4179
02:50:38.294 --> 02:50:43.294
that are hunched down amongst the remnants of this skeleton.

4180
02:50:44.018 --> 02:50:45.933
ASHLEY: The one that we're--
MATT: Mm-hmm, right here.

4181
02:50:45.933 --> 02:50:49.394
They look humanoid, medium sized.

4182
02:50:49.394 --> 02:50:51.618
They're as large as a lot of your troop.

4183
02:50:51.618 --> 02:50:54.029
Their limbs are long, clawed.

4184
02:50:54.029 --> 02:50:56.535
You can see this black, leathery skin

4185
02:50:56.535 --> 02:50:58.215
that wraps around the bones very tight.

4186
02:50:58.215 --> 02:51:01.870
The head, you can see these pointed teeth

4187
02:51:01.870 --> 02:51:03.293
that come out of an almost black

4188
02:51:03.293 --> 02:51:04.695
and skeletal expression,

4189
02:51:04.695 --> 02:51:06.154
pupil-less yellow eyes from underneath,

4190
02:51:06.154 --> 02:51:07.837
and the back of the head is elongated

4191
02:51:07.837 --> 02:51:09.452
and curves up into a singular horn.

4192
02:51:09.452 --> 02:51:11.095
Each of them has a long, thin tail

4193
02:51:11.095 --> 02:51:12.413
that whips and curls behind it,

4194
02:51:12.413 --> 02:51:13.970
and they're scraping whatever flesh

4195
02:51:13.970 --> 02:51:16.397
they can off the body, and shoveling it into their mouth.

4196
02:51:16.397 --> 02:51:18.453
Then all three of them

4197
02:51:18.453 --> 02:51:19.895
look over towards you at once.

4198
02:51:19.895 --> 02:51:21.035
What little bit of light

4199
02:51:21.035 --> 02:51:24.443
that's coming from outside flashed in their eyes.

4200
02:51:24.443 --> 02:51:26.135
They (growl).

4201
02:51:27.227 --> 02:51:29.881
MARISHA: I see Caduceus and I move towards him.

4202
02:51:29.881 --> 02:51:31.506
TALIESIN: I'm going to tap Beau

4203
02:51:31.506 --> 02:51:33.345
and you're about to light you up.

4204
02:51:33.345 --> 02:51:35.240
MATT: Roll initiative.

4205
02:51:36.095 --> 02:51:38.714
TALIESIN: Can I act before initiative?

4206
02:51:38.714 --> 02:51:39.547
MATT: As you were holding,

4207
02:51:39.547 --> 02:51:41.091
having this conversation to get ready,

4208
02:51:41.091 --> 02:51:42.350
they're going to charge in.

4209
02:51:42.350 --> 02:51:45.427
We're in initiative. There's no surprise here.

4210
02:51:45.427 --> 02:51:47.394
I'm using these as them

4211
02:51:47.394 --> 02:51:49.877
because I don't have the actual minis for the creature.

4212
02:51:49.877 --> 02:51:51.133
TALIESIN: Fudgers.

4213
02:51:51.133 --> 02:51:52.573
LIAM: Give me a high roll.

4214
02:51:52.573 --> 02:51:53.699
Damn it.

4215
02:51:53.699 --> 02:51:54.532
Seven.

4216
02:51:55.413 --> 02:51:57.296
TALIESIN: 12.

4217
02:51:57.296 --> 02:52:00.152
Where's my other die, man?

4218
02:52:00.152 --> 02:52:02.610
TRAVIS: (low-pitched) Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh!

4219
02:52:02.610 --> 02:52:05.518
LAURA: (singing) Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh!

4220
02:52:05.518 --> 02:52:08.956
LIAM: (intoning battle music)

4221
02:52:08.956 --> 02:52:10.427
(coughing in rhythm)

4222
02:52:10.427 --> 02:52:12.317
TRAVIS: (singing)

4223
02:52:12.317 --> 02:52:14.326
MATT: All righty.

4224
02:52:14.326 --> 02:52:15.436
LIAM: Have you seen this demon?

4225
02:52:15.436 --> 02:52:18.165
MATT: 25 to 20.

4226
02:52:18.165 --> 02:52:20.042
MARISHA: Ew gross.
LAURA: Oh no.

4227
02:52:20.042 --> 02:52:21.840
MATT: 20 to 15.

4228
02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:25.700
MARISHA: 15? I cannot be the highest at 15!

4229
02:52:25.700 --> 02:52:29.080
I'm the highest at 15!

4230
02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:29.913
All right.

4231
02:52:29.913 --> 02:52:31.580
TALIESIN: Aw man. This is fucking up my shit.

4232
02:52:31.580 --> 02:52:33.981
MATT: All righty. 15 to ten.

4233
02:52:33.981 --> 02:52:34.814
LIAM: 13.
TALIESIN: 12.

4234
02:52:34.814 --> 02:52:35.831
LAURA: (as Vex) 13.
SAM: Ten.

4235
02:52:35.831 --> 02:52:36.772
TRAVIS: 11.

4236
02:52:36.772 --> 02:52:37.605
MATT: Okay, hold on, hold on.

4237
02:52:37.605 --> 02:52:39.533
LIAM: (gibberish)

4238
02:52:39.533 --> 02:52:41.352
MARISHA: Wait, what was Caleb?

4239
02:52:41.352 --> 02:52:43.234
LIAM: There were two 13's.
MARISHA: Caleb.

4240
02:52:43.234 --> 02:52:44.703
LAURA: I'm 13 as well.

4241
02:52:44.703 --> 02:52:45.923
LIAM: The twins got 13.

4242
02:52:45.923 --> 02:52:48.614
LAURA: That's why I said 13 with a British accent!

4243
02:52:48.614 --> 02:52:50.937
I immediately went back to Vex!

4244
02:52:50.937 --> 02:52:52.480
TRAVIS: Fjord is 11.

4245
02:52:52.480 --> 02:52:54.617
MATT: Fjord at 11.

4246
02:52:54.617 --> 02:52:56.258
Okay.

4247
02:52:58.193 --> 02:52:59.590
Ten to five.

4248
02:53:00.593 --> 02:53:02.010
SAM: I was a ten.

4249
02:53:03.071 --> 02:53:04.562
TRAVIS: (laughs) What are you?

4250
02:53:04.562 --> 02:53:07.049
ASHLEY: Seven. With advantage, that was.

4251
02:53:07.049 --> 02:53:08.273
MATT: Wow, girl.

4252
02:53:08.273 --> 02:53:09.313
LAURA: Woo!

4253
02:53:10.311 --> 02:53:12.636
TRAVIS: Hey man, you are nothing if not consistent.

4254
02:53:12.636 --> 02:53:15.558
MATT: Oh, Landspeaker rolled a six.

4255
02:53:15.558 --> 02:53:18.308
TRAVIS: Steadfast.
LAURA: Oh jeez.

4256
02:53:19.255 --> 02:53:20.930
ASHLEY: (exhales) Great.

4257
02:53:20.930 --> 02:53:23.318
MATT: Top of the round. These creatures,

4258
02:53:23.318 --> 02:53:26.220
after standing at staring at Caduceus and Yasha,

4259
02:53:26.220 --> 02:53:27.813
the moment Caduceus begins to speak to Beau

4260
02:53:27.813 --> 02:53:29.524
and put his hand back they (shrieking)

4261
02:53:29.524 --> 02:53:32.065
and lunge towards you. Beau, you're up first.

4262
02:53:32.065 --> 02:53:32.914
You see the movement out of the corner of your eye.

4263
02:53:32.914 --> 02:53:33.855
What are you doing?

4264
02:53:33.855 --> 02:53:35.205
MARISHA: I go: What are you going to do?

4265
02:53:35.205 --> 02:53:38.062
(repeatedly) What are you going to do?

4266
02:53:38.062 --> 02:53:39.511
TALIESIN: Hold touch--yeah, I'm--

4267
02:53:39.511 --> 02:53:43.705
MARISHA: I hold my action until Caduceus goes.

4268
02:53:43.705 --> 02:53:45.865
TALIESIN: Well, I was, I said the hold touch me.

4269
02:53:45.865 --> 02:53:48.345
You need to be within--

4270
02:53:48.345 --> 02:53:49.289
MARISHA: No, I'm there.

4271
02:53:49.289 --> 02:53:51.365
MATT: You didn't have time to get that, unfortunately.

4272
02:53:51.365 --> 02:53:53.460
MARISHA: No, I'm there and I'm holding Caduceus

4273
02:53:53.460 --> 02:53:56.536
and then I hold my action until after Caduceus' turn.

4274
02:53:56.536 --> 02:53:59.163
MATT: Yeah, okay, so you move up where around Caduceus?

4275
02:53:59.163 --> 02:53:59.996
MARISHA: Right there.
MATT: There?

4276
02:53:59.996 --> 02:54:01.070
MARISHA: Yep.
MATT: Okay.

4277
02:54:01.070 --> 02:54:02.195
LAURA: Oh gosh.

4278
02:54:02.195 --> 02:54:03.870
MARISHA: I'm like what's--?

4279
02:54:03.870 --> 02:54:05.236
TALIESIN: Fuck, man, here we go.

4280
02:54:05.236 --> 02:54:06.477
MATT: That finishes Beau's turn.

4281
02:54:06.477 --> 02:54:08.974
Holding your action to do what?

4282
02:54:08.974 --> 02:54:12.516
MARISHA: 'Til after Caduceus' turn to attack.

4283
02:54:12.516 --> 02:54:13.586
MATT: Attack whatever comes by?

4284
02:54:13.586 --> 02:54:15.127
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: You got it.

4285
02:54:15.127 --> 02:54:17.422
All right, now it's those creatures' turn.

4286
02:54:17.422 --> 02:54:22.047
These lithe, demon-esque creatures all,

4287
02:54:22.047 --> 02:54:26.789
with unnatural speed (shrieks) and leap forward.

4288
02:54:26.789 --> 02:54:30.327
This one rushes to Yasha. This one rushes to Caduceus.

4289
02:54:30.327 --> 02:54:31.556
This one also rushes to Caduceus.

4290
02:54:31.556 --> 02:54:34.098
SAM: Are those guys in there? What is that?

4291
02:54:34.098 --> 02:54:35.407
LAURA: From what I can see,

4292
02:54:35.407 --> 02:54:37.568
they look like the aliens in Rick and Morty.

4293
02:54:37.568 --> 02:54:38.729
MARISHA: Yeah!

4294
02:54:38.729 --> 02:54:40.062
MATT: Against Yasha.

4295
02:54:42.469 --> 02:54:45.722
That is going to be, it takes two attack with its claws.

4296
02:54:45.722 --> 02:54:48.682
TRAVIS: ♪ It takes two, baby ♪

4297
02:54:48.682 --> 02:54:52.896
♪ It takes two, baby, me and you ♪

4298
02:54:52.896 --> 02:54:54.602
MATT: That's 14 to hit.

4299
02:54:54.602 --> 02:54:55.835
ASHLEY: 14 just hits.

4300
02:54:55.835 --> 02:54:58.725
MATT: Okay. Second attack.

4301
02:54:58.725 --> 02:55:01.126
That's going to be 16 to hit.

4302
02:55:01.126 --> 02:55:02.618
ASHLEY: I took a bite.
SAM: You did?

4303
02:55:02.618 --> 02:55:03.943
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: What's that one?

4304
02:55:03.943 --> 02:55:05.067
ASHLEY: I sealed it back up.

4305
02:55:05.067 --> 02:55:06.692
It hits. Both hit.

4306
02:55:06.692 --> 02:55:09.281
MATT: Okay, you take seven points of slashing damage.

4307
02:55:09.281 --> 02:55:10.114
ASHLEY: Okay.

4308
02:55:10.114 --> 02:55:12.043
MATT: Another seven points of slashing damage.

4309
02:55:12.043 --> 02:55:14.965
As it slashes into you, you look into its eyes,

4310
02:55:14.965 --> 02:55:17.888
the shining eyes and there's a (whoosh),

4311
02:55:17.888 --> 02:55:19.968
this green flash in your head

4312
02:55:19.968 --> 02:55:23.067
and you feel your muscles suddenly--

4313
02:55:23.067 --> 02:55:24.137
go tired.
LAURA: Oh, they steal

4314
02:55:24.137 --> 02:55:25.598
strength, they steal strength!

4315
02:55:25.598 --> 02:55:26.816
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw for me, please.

4316
02:55:26.816 --> 02:55:28.238
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

4317
02:55:28.238 --> 02:55:30.117
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, oh god.

4318
02:55:30.117 --> 02:55:31.044
ASHLEY: Oh no!

4319
02:55:31.044 --> 02:55:32.091
LIAM: Is that a one?

4320
02:55:32.091 --> 02:55:33.295
ASHLEY: It's a six.

4321
02:55:33.295 --> 02:55:35.793
TALIESIN: Is that with constitution saving throw?

4322
02:55:35.793 --> 02:55:37.920
ASHLEY: Yeah. It's just straight.

4323
02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:41.162
It's just a four and plus my plus two. Six.

4324
02:55:41.162 --> 02:55:41.995
MATT: Six.

4325
02:55:41.995 --> 02:55:44.643
Okay, you feel your body like, (gasps) sap.

4326
02:55:44.643 --> 02:55:46.826
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm sorry. Ten.

4327
02:55:46.826 --> 02:55:48.838
MATT: Still a failure, unfortunately.

4328
02:55:48.838 --> 02:55:50.321
ASHLEY: Advantage on dex!

4329
02:55:50.321 --> 02:55:52.454
No, you said constitution. Never mind!

4330
02:55:52.454 --> 02:55:55.024
MATT: Sorry. Good looking out.

4331
02:55:55.024 --> 02:55:57.093
ASHLEY: Just letting you know I have advantage on dex.

4332
02:55:57.093 --> 02:55:59.093
MATT: The two are both against Caduceus because

4333
02:55:59.093 --> 02:56:00.592
you were one of the first to walk out there.

4334
02:56:00.592 --> 02:56:04.025
That's going to be a 14 hit.

4335
02:56:04.025 --> 02:56:09.025
TALIESIN: That misses and I'm going to use that to

4336
02:56:09.430 --> 02:56:10.901
use the Shield of Retribution on that first one.

4337
02:56:10.901 --> 02:56:11.734
MATT: Okay.

4338
02:56:11.734 --> 02:56:13.484
What's it have to roll?

4339
02:56:16.751 --> 02:56:19.504
TALIESIN: You need to succeed a strength saving throw.

4340
02:56:19.504 --> 02:56:20.688
MATT: Strength saving throw.

4341
02:56:20.688 --> 02:56:22.832
That is going to be a 20 exactly.

4342
02:56:22.832 --> 02:56:24.357
TALIESIN: I don't know what its saving is.

4343
02:56:24.357 --> 02:56:25.590
LAURA and TALIESIN: It's probably--

4344
02:56:25.590 --> 02:56:27.052
MATT: It's your spell DC.

4345
02:56:27.052 --> 02:56:28.718
I'll say for now.

4346
02:56:28.718 --> 02:56:29.920
I know this would supposed to be something in the item.

4347
02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:31.600
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MATT: It succeeds.

4348
02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:33.009
TALIESIN: It does?
MATT: Yeah.

4349
02:56:33.009 --> 02:56:34.154
It takes half damage, but it's not pushed, right?

4350
02:56:34.154 --> 02:56:35.792
TALIESIN: No, it still takes damage, but it's not pushed.

4351
02:56:35.792 --> 02:56:38.305
MATT: Okay, so we'll check on that.

4352
02:56:38.305 --> 02:56:39.605
TALIESIN: That sucks, but that's okay.

4353
02:56:39.605 --> 02:56:42.521
MATT: The other attack was a 20.

4354
02:56:42.521 --> 02:56:44.521
TALIESIN: That does hit.
MATT: Okay.

4355
02:56:45.721 --> 02:56:48.746
TALIESIN: That takes--seven, eight.

4356
02:56:49.792 --> 02:56:51.866
MARISHA: Is that 20 hits?

4357
02:56:51.866 --> 02:56:52.975
TRAVIS: 20 hits, yeah.

4358
02:56:52.975 --> 02:56:53.994
TALIESIN: 18 points of force damage.

4359
02:56:53.994 --> 02:56:55.551
MATT: 18 points force damage.

4360
02:56:55.551 --> 02:56:57.951
(shrieks) It pulls back and then goes in angrily

4361
02:56:57.951 --> 02:56:59.467
and strikes you for 14 points of slashing damage.

4362
02:56:59.467 --> 02:57:02.508
TALIESIN: Ooh, rough. Rough.

4363
02:57:02.508 --> 02:57:03.928
MATT: This one glances up at you.

4364
02:57:03.928 --> 02:57:04.903
Make a constitution saving throw.

4365
02:57:04.903 --> 02:57:07.316
TALIESIN: Okay.
SAM: Oh no.

4366
02:57:07.316 --> 02:57:11.049
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. Here we go.

4367
02:57:11.049 --> 02:57:12.505
14.

4368
02:57:12.505 --> 02:57:13.727
MATT: 14, okay.

4369
02:57:13.727 --> 02:57:15.605
You do manage to shrug off whatever the effect is.

4370
02:57:15.605 --> 02:57:17.125
You blink it out of your mind.

4371
02:57:17.125 --> 02:57:20.958
The last one is also going to attack you twice.

4372
02:57:21.983 --> 02:57:23.998
As Beau rushes in, it's because

4373
02:57:23.998 --> 02:57:24.943
you were the first one to step out there,

4374
02:57:24.943 --> 02:57:27.893
they come after you at once.
MARISHA: What do you see? Oh!

4375
02:57:27.893 --> 02:57:29.321
MATT: That's going to be a 12 and a 23.

4376
02:57:29.321 --> 02:57:30.780
TALIESIN: The 23 hits.

4377
02:57:30.780 --> 02:57:31.613
MATT: 23 hits.

4378
02:57:31.613 --> 02:57:33.071
That's going to be 12 points of slashing damage.

4379
02:57:33.071 --> 02:57:34.996
TALIESIN: That's fine.

4380
02:57:34.996 --> 02:57:38.670
(shrieking)

4381
02:57:38.670 --> 02:57:41.362
That ends their turn.

4382
02:57:41.362 --> 02:57:44.628
Now it is Jester and Caleb's go.

4383
02:57:44.628 --> 02:57:45.828
LIAM: I will go.

4384
02:57:45.828 --> 02:57:47.785
Caleb starts walking that way and seeing

4385
02:57:47.785 --> 02:57:51.225
three of his friends pressed up against these things.

4386
02:57:51.225 --> 02:57:52.889
His mind quickly does the math of it

4387
02:57:52.889 --> 02:57:55.449
and scans the dimensions of the room

4388
02:57:55.449 --> 02:57:58.907
and bat guano and sulfur come out.

4389
02:57:58.907 --> 02:58:01.071
A Wall of Fire appears behind

4390
02:58:01.071 --> 02:58:05.609
these things in the space five feet over from them

4391
02:58:05.609 --> 02:58:09.125
and forms a U that stretches back around

4392
02:58:09.125 --> 02:58:10.628
whatever that altar or platform is

4393
02:58:10.628 --> 02:58:12.081
so they are getting burned

4394
02:58:12.081 --> 02:58:16.440
from behind and are stuck between fire and danger.

4395
02:58:16.440 --> 02:58:21.055
MATT: I will say they are probably there, right?

4396
02:58:21.055 --> 02:58:23.615
We'll say they're on the wall right now.

4397
02:58:23.615 --> 02:58:25.593
LIAM: I was aiming for behind them.

4398
02:58:25.593 --> 02:58:27.259
SAM: No, no. They're in it.

4399
02:58:27.259 --> 02:58:28.092
LIAM: They're in it, okay.

4400
02:58:28.092 --> 02:58:30.529
MATT: If you're aiming out and you

4401
02:58:30.529 --> 02:58:31.991
put it behind them and pushing towards them

4402
02:58:31.991 --> 02:58:32.824
for the ten feet?

4403
02:58:32.824 --> 02:58:34.632
LIAM: ut it damages things ten feet out

4404
02:58:34.632 --> 02:58:37.555
and my friends are within that ten feet so I'm not--

4405
02:58:37.555 --> 02:58:39.380
MATT: I understand. I misunderstood you initially. My

4406
02:58:39.380 --> 02:58:41.046
My apologies.

4407
02:58:41.046 --> 02:58:43.890
LIAM: Enough to toast their asses, but not my friends.

4408
02:58:43.890 --> 02:58:45.465
MATT: Then the U is--

4409
02:58:45.465 --> 02:58:46.298
TALIESIN: Nice.

4410
02:58:46.298 --> 02:58:48.372
MATT: You said ten feet is the range?

4411
02:58:48.372 --> 02:58:50.262
LIAM: Ten feet is the range.

4412
02:58:50.262 --> 02:58:53.050
I would know to not put it within ten feet of my friends.

4413
02:58:53.050 --> 02:58:57.232
MATT: Correct. I'll put it there.

4414
02:58:57.232 --> 02:58:58.898
The chamber burns.

4415
02:58:58.898 --> 02:59:02.066
The giant corpse there is smoldering now.

4416
02:59:02.066 --> 02:59:04.002
You can see the elements of the bones

4417
02:59:04.002 --> 02:59:05.425
now black against the flames.

4418
02:59:05.425 --> 02:59:09.691
The shadow of its presence giving this interesting visual

4419
02:59:09.691 --> 02:59:13.267
as you hear the demons shriek from the pain.

4420
02:59:13.267 --> 02:59:15.077
Roll damage. What's the saving throw for them?

4421
02:59:15.077 --> 02:59:19.050
LIAM: It's--digga, digga, digga--dex 17.

4422
02:59:19.050 --> 02:59:21.233
MATT: That is a...

4423
02:59:23.327 --> 02:59:24.744
24 for--no sorry.

4424
02:59:26.476 --> 02:59:29.703
No, that is a 21 on one of them.

4425
02:59:29.703 --> 02:59:30.625
LIAM: That saves.

4426
02:59:30.625 --> 02:59:33.568
MATT: It's a seven and there it's a fail.

4427
02:59:33.568 --> 02:59:36.102
The other one rolled well. That's another 21.

4428
02:59:36.102 --> 02:59:37.210
LIAM: Two successes

4429
02:59:37.210 --> 02:59:38.126
and one fail.
MATT: Correct.

4430
02:59:38.126 --> 02:59:40.908
The one on the side succeeded, the one in the middle failed.

4431
02:59:40.908 --> 02:59:43.111
LIAM: Not that great.

4432
02:59:43.111 --> 02:59:44.674
20 total.

4433
02:59:44.674 --> 02:59:45.991
So 20 and ten.

4434
02:59:47.549 --> 02:59:48.765
MATT: All right, ten.

4435
02:59:48.765 --> 02:59:49.953
20.

4436
02:59:49.953 --> 02:59:51.591
The one in the center,

4437
02:59:51.591 --> 02:59:53.436
the one that was damaged by Caduceus

4438
02:59:53.436 --> 02:59:54.796
is the one that also took the most amount

4439
02:59:54.796 --> 02:59:56.111
of damage from this. (shrieking)

4440
02:59:56.111 --> 02:59:57.172
As they're all burning, you can see

4441
02:59:57.172 --> 02:59:59.274
the heat causing elements of their leathery body

4442
02:59:59.274 --> 03:00:02.584
to dry out and like (hissing) this mist

4443
03:00:02.584 --> 03:00:05.375
rises off from the corners of their shoulders.

4444
03:00:05.375 --> 03:00:06.744
Does that finish your go, Caleb?

4445
03:00:06.744 --> 03:00:08.062
LIAM: That is correct.

4446
03:00:08.062 --> 03:00:08.895
MATT: Jester.

4447
03:00:08.895 --> 03:00:12.579
LAURA: Okay. Where am I? There I am.

4448
03:00:12.579 --> 03:00:16.264
I'm going to step forward behind Caleb-ish.

4449
03:00:16.264 --> 03:00:19.346
I mean behind Caduceus like yeah, right about there.

4450
03:00:19.346 --> 03:00:20.462
MATT: Okay.

4451
03:00:20.462 --> 03:00:22.643
LAURA: I'm going to close my eyes

4452
03:00:22.643 --> 03:00:24.940
and hold out my hands and I'm going

4453
03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:27.428
to cast Spiritual Guardians.

4454
03:00:27.428 --> 03:00:28.498
MATT: Okay.

4455
03:00:28.498 --> 03:00:29.331
TALIESIN: Ooh.

4456
03:00:29.331 --> 03:00:32.382
LAURA: To attack anything that isn't part of our party.

4457
03:00:32.382 --> 03:00:33.215
MATT: Right.

4458
03:00:33.215 --> 03:00:34.568
That is within the range around you?

4459
03:00:34.568 --> 03:00:35.401
What's the radius?

4460
03:00:35.401 --> 03:00:37.067
LAURA: That's a 15 feet radius.

4461
03:00:37.067 --> 03:00:38.488
So I would be within 15 feet of them, hopefully.

4462
03:00:38.488 --> 03:00:39.982
That's where I was aiming for.

4463
03:00:39.982 --> 03:00:41.656
MATT: If you want to get all of them

4464
03:00:41.656 --> 03:00:42.540
you'd probably have to go there.

4465
03:00:42.540 --> 03:00:43.373
LAURA: Okay.

4466
03:00:43.373 --> 03:00:44.531
MATT: Then you can get them all in.

4467
03:00:44.531 --> 03:00:45.364
Okay?

4468
03:00:45.364 --> 03:00:48.078
You cast it. It happens at the start of their turn.

4469
03:00:48.078 --> 03:00:49.650
LAURA: They float around me.

4470
03:00:49.650 --> 03:00:51.283
When you cast the spell,

4471
03:00:52.900 --> 03:00:54.542
their speed is halved.

4472
03:00:54.542 --> 03:00:56.131
Where the fuck does it say?

4473
03:00:56.131 --> 03:00:56.964
SAM: Right under that.

4474
03:00:56.964 --> 03:00:58.051
TRAVIS: It stays?

4475
03:00:58.051 --> 03:00:59.710
SAM: When a creature enters the area

4476
03:00:59.710 --> 03:01:01.571
or starts its turn there, it must

4477
03:01:01.571 --> 03:01:03.107
make the wisdom saving throw.

4478
03:01:03.107 --> 03:01:04.964
MATT: Okay, so it's on their turn that the effect happens.

4479
03:01:04.964 --> 03:01:05.797
You got it.

4480
03:01:05.797 --> 03:01:07.368
All right, so you cast Spirit Guardians.

4481
03:01:07.368 --> 03:01:11.086
The cloud of somewhat spectral but happily leaping

4482
03:01:11.086 --> 03:01:14.580
around unicorns suddenly begin to swirl around Jester

4483
03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:16.836
giving a faint glow to the vicinity

4484
03:01:16.836 --> 03:01:17.875
of this darkened chamber.

4485
03:01:17.875 --> 03:01:19.608
LAURA: Pinkish-purple beauty.

4486
03:01:19.608 --> 03:01:21.108
MARISHA: (giggles gleefully)

4487
03:01:21.108 --> 03:01:23.193
MATT: All right, is that your turn?

4488
03:01:23.193 --> 03:01:24.026
LAURA: Yeah.

4489
03:01:24.026 --> 03:01:25.362
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

4490
03:01:25.362 --> 03:01:28.572
TALIESIN: The question is do we launch

4491
03:01:28.572 --> 03:01:30.723
the nuke now or do we want to launch the nuke later?

4492
03:01:30.723 --> 03:01:33.979
MARISHA: I'm holding onto you going whoa, whoa, what?

4493
03:01:33.979 --> 03:01:35.443
TALIESIN: I've been wanting to try something.

4494
03:01:35.443 --> 03:01:37.265
I'm going to try this because I've been meaning to try it.

4495
03:01:37.265 --> 03:01:38.244
Fuck it.

4496
03:01:38.244 --> 03:01:39.722
MATT: The creatures are in range by the way

4497
03:01:39.722 --> 03:01:41.226
if you want to use your reaction.

4498
03:01:41.226 --> 03:01:42.531
Are you waiting for him?

4499
03:01:42.531 --> 03:01:43.364
LAURA: Yes.

4500
03:01:43.364 --> 03:01:44.239
MARISHA: Use my reaction?

4501
03:01:44.239 --> 03:01:45.722
I'm waiting for him.

4502
03:01:46.805 --> 03:01:48.075
TALIESIN: Yeah, this lasts an hour?

4503
03:01:48.075 --> 03:01:49.216
This will be fun.

4504
03:01:49.216 --> 03:01:51.120
We're not being sneaky anymore.

4505
03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:51.953
LAURA: Do it!

4506
03:01:51.953 --> 03:01:53.007
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Holy Weapon.

4507
03:01:53.007 --> 03:01:53.866
Let's see how this goes.

4508
03:01:53.866 --> 03:01:54.699
MARISHA: What does that mean?

4509
03:01:54.699 --> 03:01:55.532
MATT: Okay.

4510
03:01:55.532 --> 03:01:56.969
MARISHA: What does that mean?

4511
03:01:56.969 --> 03:01:57.988
TALIESIN: I'm burning a big one.

4512
03:01:57.988 --> 03:01:59.007
LIAM: Weapon kick ass.

4513
03:01:59.007 --> 03:01:59.840
SAM: It's a lollypop.

4514
03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:01.183
TALIESIN: It's a lollypop.

4515
03:02:01.183 --> 03:02:03.640
So you now, you are our light source.

4516
03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:04.656
SAM: Uh huh.

4517
03:02:04.656 --> 03:02:05.722
TRAVIS: Oh!

4518
03:02:05.722 --> 03:02:06.555
MARISHA: Okay.

4519
03:02:06.555 --> 03:02:08.143
MATT: Are you touching the staff or her fists?

4520
03:02:08.143 --> 03:02:09.940
TALIESIN: Her fists, I believe.

4521
03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:11.276
MATT: So, as--

4522
03:02:11.276 --> 03:02:13.195
TALIESIN: That's--yeah, the fists.

4523
03:02:13.195 --> 03:02:14.927
MATT: As Caduceus reaches out and grabs you,

4524
03:02:14.927 --> 03:02:17.247
you watches both of your hands (whooshing)

4525
03:02:17.247 --> 03:02:19.428
begin to give off this divine glow

4526
03:02:19.428 --> 03:02:21.487
like a faint candlelight around you

4527
03:02:21.487 --> 03:02:23.423
that greats brighter and brighter.

4528
03:02:23.423 --> 03:02:25.380
Your hands feel warm almost like

4529
03:02:25.380 --> 03:02:28.101
you placed them into a hot spring.

4530
03:02:28.101 --> 03:02:30.063
And you can see this sparkling sheen

4531
03:02:30.063 --> 03:02:32.801
across your flesh and every knuckle.

4532
03:02:32.801 --> 03:02:34.543
TALIESIN: Add 2d8 radiant to every attack.

4533
03:02:34.543 --> 03:02:36.520
MARISHA: What!
TRAVIS: Whoa shit!

4534
03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:39.296
LIAM: I only know what this means because of Liev'Tel.

4535
03:02:39.296 --> 03:02:43.164
MARISHA: 2d8 radiant to every attack?

4536
03:02:43.164 --> 03:02:43.997
MATT: Yes.

4537
03:02:43.997 --> 03:02:46.951
MARISHA: (excited yelling)

4538
03:02:46.951 --> 03:02:47.797
LAURA: That's awesome.

4539
03:02:47.797 --> 03:02:49.284
MATT: It's concentration for an hour.

4540
03:02:49.284 --> 03:02:50.879
You have it for an hour.
SAM: An hour?

4541
03:02:50.879 --> 03:02:52.545
MATT: Or until you lose concentration.

4542
03:02:52.545 --> 03:02:53.582
TALIESIN: Or, yeah and I can also--

4543
03:02:53.582 --> 03:02:54.643
I've got some other stuff I can do

4544
03:02:54.643 --> 03:02:55.543
with it too but--

4545
03:02:55.543 --> 03:02:58.638
ASHLEY: Ooh, that's cool!
MARISHA: All right and...

4546
03:02:58.638 --> 03:03:00.408
reaction

4547
03:03:00.408 --> 03:03:03.731
into all my action time.

4548
03:03:03.731 --> 03:03:04.564
MATT: All right so you

4549
03:03:04.564 --> 03:03:06.094
get two attacks.

4550
03:03:06.094 --> 03:03:07.571
Get two attacks on that guy there

4551
03:03:07.571 --> 03:03:08.776
or the one in the middle, up to you.

4552
03:03:08.776 --> 03:03:09.609
There's the one that's been hurt

4553
03:03:09.609 --> 03:03:10.798
really bad or the two that are--

4554
03:03:10.798 --> 03:03:12.211
the one that's been hurt the most

4555
03:03:12.211 --> 03:03:13.587
and the two that have been slightly hurt.

4556
03:03:13.587 --> 03:03:14.455
MARISHA: Wait, who's been hurt the most?

4557
03:03:14.455 --> 03:03:16.353
MATT: The middle one there.

4558
03:03:16.353 --> 03:03:18.899
MARISHA: Uh... (stuttering)

4559
03:03:18.899 --> 03:03:20.819
Yeah, we'll do one to the middle guy

4560
03:03:20.819 --> 03:03:23.172
and one to the side guy.

4561
03:03:23.172 --> 03:03:25.304
MARISHA: First attack.

4562
03:03:25.304 --> 03:03:27.447
What's that, what's that?

4563
03:03:27.447 --> 03:03:28.300
Horrible!

4564
03:03:28.300 --> 03:03:29.875
LIAM: It was terrible.

4565
03:03:29.875 --> 03:03:31.395
MARISHA: Aw, 12.

4566
03:03:31.395 --> 03:03:32.861
MATT: 12 misses.

4567
03:03:32.861 --> 03:03:35.523
You're so distracted by this cool motion that you go,

4568
03:03:35.523 --> 03:03:36.862
(grunts) and go to swing and the creature

4569
03:03:36.862 --> 03:03:37.820
(hissing),

4570
03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:38.753
and dodges out of the way.

4571
03:03:38.753 --> 03:03:39.586
It's tail--
MARISHA: Hang on!

4572
03:03:39.586 --> 03:03:40.419
One more time.

4573
03:03:40.419 --> 03:03:41.303
MATT: It's tail whips around and almost catches

4574
03:03:41.303 --> 03:03:43.804
you in the cheek and you're like, (grunts)!

4575
03:03:43.804 --> 03:03:44.637
LAURA: No.

4576
03:03:44.637 --> 03:03:45.990
LIAM: She blinded herself with her own hands.

4577
03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:47.273
MARISHA: It's the same thing.

4578
03:03:47.273 --> 03:03:48.106
MATT: Oh.

4579
03:03:48.106 --> 03:03:50.739
As you duck out of the way for its tail.

4580
03:03:50.739 --> 03:03:52.963
It goes wide and you go to try and do another punch.

4581
03:03:52.963 --> 03:03:56.478
It glares at you (shrieking).

4582
03:03:56.478 --> 03:03:59.361
MARISHA: I promise I won't disappoint you.

4583
03:03:59.361 --> 03:04:01.032
MATT: You try to punch it, and it's just out of range.

4584
03:04:01.032 --> 03:04:02.090
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

4585
03:04:02.090 --> 03:04:03.450
MATT: You can't do a bonus action.

4586
03:04:03.450 --> 03:04:05.050
Your hold is the action you have.

4587
03:04:05.050 --> 03:04:06.716
MARISHA: But I have a reaction.

4588
03:04:06.716 --> 03:04:09.109
MATT: It's your reaction to then do the action,

4589
03:04:09.109 --> 03:04:10.867
but you only get the bonus action on your turn.

4590
03:04:10.867 --> 03:04:12.115
TALIESIN: As long as I don't lose concentration.

4591
03:04:12.115 --> 03:04:14.465
MARISHA: I will fix this.

4592
03:04:14.465 --> 03:04:17.113
LIAM: (repeatedly) Next round.

4593
03:04:17.113 --> 03:04:19.654
MATT: That finishes your turn, Caduceus?

4594
03:04:19.654 --> 03:04:21.235
TALIESIN: I have a bonus action.

4595
03:04:21.235 --> 03:04:22.385
MATT: And a move, if you wish.

4596
03:04:22.385 --> 03:04:23.590
TALIESIN: And a move, but they have reactions

4597
03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:24.750
against me if I were to move.

4598
03:04:24.750 --> 03:04:25.583
MATT: Probably.

4599
03:04:25.583 --> 03:04:28.723
You have two of them that are immediately against you.

4600
03:04:28.723 --> 03:04:32.648
TALIESIN: Then for fun--yeah, you know,

4601
03:04:32.648 --> 03:04:36.572
actually, I don't really have a good bonus action.

4602
03:04:36.572 --> 03:04:39.521
I guess I'm going to--yeah.

4603
03:04:39.521 --> 03:04:40.844
LAURA: Yeah, there's not really any good bonus actions.

4604
03:04:40.844 --> 03:04:43.403
TALIESIN: Yeah, I cannot find any of my stuff so--

4605
03:04:43.403 --> 03:04:44.604
MATT: Okay, that finishes your turn?

4606
03:04:44.604 --> 03:04:45.437
TALIESIN: Yeah, that finishes my turn.

4607
03:04:45.437 --> 03:04:46.353
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

4608
03:04:46.353 --> 03:04:48.561
TRAVIS: I will use my movement

4609
03:04:48.561 --> 03:04:51.019
to enter into this chamber

4610
03:04:51.019 --> 03:04:53.089
behind Caleb and myself.

4611
03:04:53.089 --> 03:04:53.922
MATT: Okay.

4612
03:04:53.922 --> 03:04:54.755
TRAVIS: 30 feet in.

4613
03:04:54.755 --> 03:04:55.588
MATT: Okay.

4614
03:04:55.588 --> 03:04:56.561
Put you about there.

4615
03:04:56.561 --> 03:05:00.000
TRAVIS: Great and I will turn and send two blasts

4616
03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.550
of Eldritch Blast towards

4617
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:04.156
the one in front of Beau

4618
03:05:04.156 --> 03:05:06.396
and the one in front of Caduceus.

4619
03:05:06.396 --> 03:05:07.297
MATT: You got it.

4620
03:05:07.297 --> 03:05:08.710
SAM: They've been a blast!

4621
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:10.700
MATT: The one in front of Caduceus?

4622
03:05:10.700 --> 03:05:11.777
TRAVIS: 18 to hit.

4623
03:05:11.777 --> 03:05:12.700
MATT: Hits.

4624
03:05:12.700 --> 03:05:14.858
TALIESIN: Oh that's nice, wow.

4625
03:05:14.858 --> 03:05:18.582
TRAVIS: That is seven, 12 points of force damage.

4626
03:05:18.582 --> 03:05:20.246
MATT: (shrieking)

4627
03:05:20.246 --> 03:05:21.580
TRAVIS: Second one.

4628
03:05:21.580 --> 03:05:26.362
LIAM: (singing) I got friends in eldritch places!

4629
03:05:26.362 --> 03:05:28.729
TRAVIS: And a 17 to hit on the second one.

4630
03:05:28.729 --> 03:05:29.562
MATT: That hits.

4631
03:05:29.562 --> 03:05:30.511
TRAVIS: All right, okay.

4632
03:05:32.353 --> 03:05:35.317
That is nine points of force damage.

4633
03:05:35.317 --> 03:05:36.150
MATT: Nine points.

4634
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.983
The one that's in front

4635
03:05:36.983 --> 03:05:38.991
of Caduceus is looking pretty rough.

4636
03:05:38.991 --> 03:05:40.410
TRAVIS: Okay.

4637
03:05:40.410 --> 03:05:41.788
MATT: The other two are looking--

4638
03:05:41.788 --> 03:05:43.942
some wear and tear but they're still holding up okay.

4639
03:05:43.942 --> 03:05:44.826
That finish your turn?

4640
03:05:44.826 --> 03:05:45.747
TRAVIS: Yes.

4641
03:05:45.747 --> 03:05:46.580
MATT: All right.

4642
03:05:46.580 --> 03:05:48.511
That brings us to Nott and Yasha,

4643
03:05:48.511 --> 03:05:49.491
you're on deck.

4644
03:05:49.491 --> 03:05:51.071
SAM: There's one that's worse then the others?

4645
03:05:51.071 --> 03:05:52.304
MATT: Yes, the one that's in front of Caduceus.

4646
03:05:52.304 --> 03:05:55.530
SAM: I will skitter towards Fjord, actually

4647
03:05:55.530 --> 03:06:00.383
and as I run fire off a shot.

4648
03:06:00.383 --> 03:06:02.581
I'm going to go just short of where Fjord is actually,

4649
03:06:02.581 --> 03:06:03.781
near that basin thing.

4650
03:06:03.781 --> 03:06:04.614
MATT: Oh, there?

4651
03:06:04.614 --> 03:06:06.442
Or you can move there if you want to.

4652
03:06:06.442 --> 03:06:08.939
SAM: (undecided) I should really... sure.

4653
03:06:08.939 --> 03:06:10.565
Yeah, that's good.

4654
03:06:10.565 --> 03:06:12.523
MATT: Actually, that's as far as you can get right there.

4655
03:06:12.523 --> 03:06:13.356
SAM: That's fine.

4656
03:06:13.356 --> 03:06:14.572
Fire off a shot at

4657
03:06:14.572 --> 03:06:16.143
the one that looks the worst.

4658
03:06:16.143 --> 03:06:16.976
MATT: That's the one in front of Caduceus.

4659
03:06:16.976 --> 03:06:17.809
Go for it.

4660
03:06:18.992 --> 03:06:20.703
SAM: Ooh, terrible.

4661
03:06:23.205 --> 03:06:24.159
14.

4662
03:06:24.159 --> 03:06:26.200
MATT: 14 misses or it hits,

4663
03:06:26.200 --> 03:06:28.625
but you watch it glide off its leather armor.

4664
03:06:28.625 --> 03:06:32.608
Its actual body is built to be pretty sturdy, pretty tough.

4665
03:06:32.608 --> 03:06:34.242
SAM: Bonus action, fire again.

4666
03:06:34.242 --> 03:06:35.370
MATT: Go for it.

4667
03:06:35.370 --> 03:06:36.774
SAM: Much better.

4668
03:06:36.774 --> 03:06:38.049
29.

4669
03:06:38.049 --> 03:06:38.882
MATT: That hits.
LAURA: Wow.

4670
03:06:38.882 --> 03:06:40.346
MATT: Because it is in melee

4671
03:06:40.346 --> 03:06:41.386
with Caduceus you do sneak attack.

4672
03:06:41.386 --> 03:06:42.219
SAM: Yes!

4673
03:06:42.219 --> 03:06:43.052
Sneak attack!

4674
03:06:43.052 --> 03:06:44.389
TALIESIN: Hurt it bad. Oh my god!

4675
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:45.983
That's just disgusting.

4676
03:06:45.983 --> 03:06:47.818
MATT: Rogues, man.

4677
03:06:47.818 --> 03:06:48.935
SAM: Oh, these are terrible.

4678
03:06:48.935 --> 03:06:49.893
LAURA: Yeah. That's not very good.

4679
03:06:49.893 --> 03:06:50.984
LIAM: That's average.

4680
03:06:50.984 --> 03:06:52.343
LAURA: Yeah, it's average.

4681
03:06:53.762 --> 03:06:54.827
SAM: 24.

4682
03:06:56.812 --> 03:06:57.837
24.

4683
03:06:57.837 --> 03:06:59.184
MATT: 24 points of damage.

4684
03:06:59.184 --> 03:07:00.392
(shrieking)

4685
03:07:00.392 --> 03:07:01.264
SAM: Still alive?

4686
03:07:01.264 --> 03:07:02.097
MATT: Yeah, still alive.

4687
03:07:02.097 --> 03:07:02.930
SAM: Damn!

4688
03:07:02.930 --> 03:07:04.151
MATT: You see black blood dripping out

4689
03:07:04.151 --> 03:07:06.164
of its lower jagged broken teeth

4690
03:07:06.164 --> 03:07:08.422
that are protruding from its skull-like face.

4691
03:07:08.422 --> 03:07:09.819
It's still holding on.

4692
03:07:09.819 --> 03:07:12.635
SAM: I don't have any other bonuses or anything but--

4693
03:07:12.635 --> 03:07:13.753
MATT: No, you moved, action, and bonus action.

4694
03:07:13.753 --> 03:07:15.782
SAM: I can't see into the basin at all?

4695
03:07:16.724 --> 03:07:18.054
MATT: You'll have to take that next turn.

4696
03:07:18.054 --> 03:07:18.887
SAM: Cool.

4697
03:07:18.887 --> 03:07:20.199
MATT: You've just finished spending

4698
03:07:20.199 --> 03:07:21.032
your whole turn looking

4699
03:07:21.032 --> 03:07:22.333
forward so.

4700
03:07:22.333 --> 03:07:23.820
You begin to turn towards the basin.

4701
03:07:23.820 --> 03:07:25.111
That brings us now to Yasha.

4702
03:07:25.111 --> 03:07:27.027
ASHLEY: Ah, I would like to rage.

4703
03:07:27.027 --> 03:07:28.614
MATT: All right bonus action, rage.

4704
03:07:28.614 --> 03:07:29.456
SAM: I would like to rage.

4705
03:07:29.456 --> 03:07:31.509
ASHLEY: I would like to rage!

4706
03:07:33.559 --> 03:07:35.064
I'm a little obscured by

4707
03:07:35.064 --> 03:07:36.918
the fire flames so I can't see but,

4708
03:07:36.918 --> 03:07:40.235
there does seem one that's bigger then the other.

4709
03:07:40.235 --> 03:07:41.092
MATT: I'll say right now this corpse

4710
03:07:41.092 --> 03:07:42.314
is mostly burned away so

4711
03:07:42.314 --> 03:07:43.254
I'll just take it out of there

4712
03:07:43.254 --> 03:07:44.542
so you have a better chance to see.

4713
03:07:44.542 --> 03:07:45.533
ASHLEY: Okay.

4714
03:07:45.533 --> 03:07:47.131
SAM: There's one that's more hurt then the other.

4715
03:07:47.131 --> 03:07:48.514
There's not one that's bigger

4716
03:07:48.514 --> 03:07:49.347
than the other.
MATT: This one here

4717
03:07:49.347 --> 03:07:50.180
is hurt the most.

4718
03:07:50.180 --> 03:07:52.186
Both of them have been damaged a little.

4719
03:07:52.186 --> 03:07:54.150
ASHLEY: Okay. The one closest to me which I guess

4720
03:07:54.150 --> 03:07:55.915
is the one that's hurt those most. Does that sound right?

4721
03:07:55.915 --> 03:07:57.451
MATT: Both of these are right up against you.

4722
03:07:57.451 --> 03:07:59.094
So if you want to go for the one that's hurt the most,

4723
03:07:59.094 --> 03:08:01.336
and there's one to your left that's--

4724
03:08:01.336 --> 03:08:02.214
ASHLEY: Yes, okay.

4725
03:08:02.214 --> 03:08:03.589
MATT: Go for it and roll an attack.

4726
03:08:03.589 --> 03:08:04.422
ASHLEY: Come on.

4727
03:08:05.815 --> 03:08:07.110
TALIESIN: That's cocked.

4728
03:08:07.110 --> 03:08:08.272
That's weird, sorry.

4729
03:08:08.272 --> 03:08:09.228
Yeah, I know.

4730
03:08:09.228 --> 03:08:11.728
That might've done it.

4731
03:08:12.656 --> 03:08:13.805
ASHLEY: 22.

4732
03:08:13.805 --> 03:08:14.638
MATT: That hits.

4733
03:08:14.638 --> 03:08:15.670
Go ahead and roll damage.

4734
03:08:15.670 --> 03:08:16.587
ASHLEY: All right.

4735
03:08:16.587 --> 03:08:19.147
(dice rattling)

4736
03:08:19.147 --> 03:08:21.347
ASHLEY: Let's do...

4737
03:08:21.347 --> 03:08:22.987
(groaning)

4738
03:08:22.987 --> 03:08:24.321
I'm going to roll those again.

4739
03:08:24.321 --> 03:08:25.814
MATT: Because Savage Attacker. Go for it.

4740
03:08:25.814 --> 03:08:27.471
(dice rattling)

4741
03:08:27.471 --> 03:08:28.448
ASHELY:That's better.

4742
03:08:28.448 --> 03:08:29.281
Okay.

4743
03:08:29.281 --> 03:08:30.864
So (counting)

4744
03:08:32.115 --> 03:08:37.065
(dramatic music)

4745
03:08:38.653 --> 03:08:39.685
26.

4746
03:08:39.685 --> 03:08:40.518
SAM: Okay!

4747
03:08:40.518 --> 03:08:42.918
MATT: 26 damage. You carve through and your body

4748
03:08:42.918 --> 03:08:45.920
is just not giving the oomph

4749
03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:46.758
that it once did.

4750
03:08:46.758 --> 03:08:48.795
You do damage but it's not as much as you thought.

4751
03:08:48.795 --> 03:08:49.904
LAURA: Ugh!

4752
03:08:49.904 --> 03:08:51.837
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

4753
03:08:51.837 --> 03:08:52.987
ASHLEY: Son of a biscuit!

4754
03:08:52.987 --> 03:08:55.215
What do I--okay.

4755
03:08:55.215 --> 03:08:56.048
TRAVIS: Ragé!

4756
03:08:56.048 --> 03:08:56.881
MATT: If you like.

4757
03:08:56.881 --> 03:08:57.714
SAM: She's ragéing.

4758
03:08:57.714 --> 03:08:58.547
ASHLEY: I'm ragéing, I'm ragéing.

4759
03:08:58.547 --> 03:08:59.380
TRAVIS: Ragé harder.

4760
03:08:59.380 --> 03:09:00.712
(laughter)

4761
03:09:00.712 --> 03:09:01.771
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll take my other--

4762
03:09:01.771 --> 03:09:04.096
SAM: And ragé and ragé.
ASHLEY: Attack.

4763
03:09:04.096 --> 03:09:05.031
I don't have another attack?

4764
03:09:05.031 --> 03:09:07.097
TRAVIS: Ragé, ragé, ragé.

4765
03:09:07.097 --> 03:09:07.930
LIAM: Ragé.

4766
03:09:07.930 --> 03:09:09.581
ASHLEY: Ragé. Ragé.

4767
03:09:09.581 --> 03:09:10.947
But I have another attack.

4768
03:09:10.947 --> 03:09:12.080
MATT: You do.

4769
03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:13.313
ASHLEY: Okay.

4770
03:09:13.313 --> 03:09:15.786
TALIESIN: Do we know what's wrong? Is it poison or is it--?

4771
03:09:15.786 --> 03:09:16.619
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

4772
03:09:16.619 --> 03:09:18.319
(cheering)

4773
03:09:18.319 --> 03:09:19.602
MATT: Definitely hits.

4774
03:09:19.602 --> 03:09:22.467
Go ahead and roll your dice and double your dice

4775
03:09:22.467 --> 03:09:24.467
and then add an additional 2d6.

4776
03:09:30.345 --> 03:09:31.965
And then add an additional d6.

4777
03:09:31.965 --> 03:09:36.148
(chattering softly)

4778
03:09:36.148 --> 03:09:37.230
ASHLEY: 22.

4779
03:09:37.230 --> 03:09:38.085
MATT: 22.

4780
03:09:38.085 --> 03:09:40.451
Still doing not so much damage as

4781
03:09:40.451 --> 03:09:42.489
you would hope but it is enough to cleave the creature

4782
03:09:42.489 --> 03:09:44.490
entirely in two.
SAM: Yes!

4783
03:09:44.490 --> 03:09:46.485
MATT: As you take the blade in with the second strike,

4784
03:09:46.485 --> 03:09:49.193
jam it into it's abdomen and then lift upward.

4785
03:09:49.193 --> 03:09:52.077
(exploding) And collapses to the ground.

4786
03:09:52.077 --> 03:09:53.472
Stumbles back a few feet.

4787
03:09:53.472 --> 03:09:55.214
Then collapses into the wall of fire

4788
03:09:55.214 --> 03:09:57.813
and begins to burn away.

4789
03:09:57.813 --> 03:09:58.646
ASHLEY: Okay.

4790
03:09:58.646 --> 03:09:59.479
SAM: Yes!

4791
03:09:59.479 --> 03:10:00.312
One down.

4792
03:10:00.312 --> 03:10:02.596
LAURA: Go fuck yourself, chasme.

4793
03:10:03.562 --> 03:10:04.395
ASHLEY: Why?

4794
03:10:04.395 --> 03:10:06.303
What's happening to me?

4795
03:10:06.303 --> 03:10:07.626
Why I am not--why didn't it--?

4796
03:10:07.626 --> 03:10:10.106
MATT: Make another constitution saving throw, please.

4797
03:10:10.106 --> 03:10:10.947
ASHLEY: Okay.

4798
03:10:10.947 --> 03:10:11.997
LAURA: Another one?

4799
03:10:11.997 --> 03:10:13.071
What?

4800
03:10:13.071 --> 03:10:15.153
SAM: I believe in you, Yasha!

4801
03:10:15.153 --> 03:10:15.986
ASHLEY: 17.

4802
03:10:15.986 --> 03:10:16.944
MATT: 17.

4803
03:10:16.944 --> 03:10:18.152
Whatever sickly feeling

4804
03:10:18.152 --> 03:10:21.154
has taken hold in your body, it fades.

4805
03:10:21.154 --> 03:10:22.618
Your strength returns.

4806
03:10:22.618 --> 03:10:23.789
ASHLEY: Thank god.

4807
03:10:23.789 --> 03:10:25.156
TALIESIN: Bad spider.

4808
03:10:25.156 --> 03:10:26.458
You shouldn't have eaten that spider.

4809
03:10:26.458 --> 03:10:27.616
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe that's what it was.

4810
03:10:27.616 --> 03:10:28.449
MATT: Okay.

4811
03:10:28.449 --> 03:10:29.282
Top of the round.

4812
03:10:29.282 --> 03:10:31.598
That brings us to...

4813
03:10:32.973 --> 03:10:34.032
...the buzzing sound.

4814
03:10:34.032 --> 03:10:35.090
TRAVIS: What?

4815
03:10:35.090 --> 03:10:36.531
SAM: I thought we were fighting the buzzing sound?

4816
03:10:36.531 --> 03:10:37.364
TALIESIN: Oh no.

4817
03:10:37.364 --> 03:10:39.076
MATT: These creatures were just making growling noises.

4818
03:10:39.076 --> 03:10:43.217
You hear (buzzing) sound

4819
03:10:43.217 --> 03:10:47.028
that begins to echo seemingly sourcelessly from up above.

4820
03:10:47.952 --> 03:10:50.974
As you're casting spells and doesn't really know

4821
03:10:50.974 --> 03:10:52.031
where it's coming from and Fjord,

4822
03:10:52.031 --> 03:10:53.427
as you finish throwing your two bolts,

4823
03:10:53.427 --> 03:10:54.852
you glance up just in time to see

4824
03:10:54.852 --> 03:10:57.231
something shadowy dive down from above.

4825
03:10:57.231 --> 03:10:58.556
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh no.

4826
03:10:59.730 --> 03:11:01.028
SAM: What is that?

4827
03:11:01.028 --> 03:11:06.028
(yelling)

4828
03:11:06.109 --> 03:11:08.655
SAM: If I wasn't so scared in this moment,

4829
03:11:08.655 --> 03:11:11.252
I would say that that monster looks ridiculous.

4830
03:11:11.252 --> 03:11:12.628
(laughter)

4831
03:11:12.628 --> 03:11:15.105
MATT: It's one of the more ridiculous-looking demons,

4832
03:11:15.105 --> 03:11:19.034
but it's also about getting the drop on your Warlock so.

4833
03:11:19.034 --> 03:11:20.031
MARISHA: That Gary Busey hair.

4834
03:11:20.031 --> 03:11:21.972
LAURA: I straight up drew them as a joke

4835
03:11:21.972 --> 03:11:23.572
and it looked like him!

4836
03:11:23.572 --> 03:11:25.545
TALIESIN: You chose the form of our destroyer.

4837
03:11:25.545 --> 03:11:26.378
Well done.

4838
03:11:26.378 --> 03:11:28.820
(laughter)

4839
03:11:28.820 --> 03:11:30.298
MATT: The one demon of the Abyss that

4840
03:11:30.298 --> 03:11:32.879
gets picked on the most. Trust me,

4841
03:11:32.879 --> 03:11:33.835
it can still do some fun stuff.

4842
03:11:33.835 --> 03:11:35.435
TRAVIS: Oh no!

4843
03:11:35.435 --> 03:11:38.959
MATT: That sound is filling the space around it.

4844
03:11:38.959 --> 03:11:40.499
It's actually going to dive down,

4845
03:11:40.499 --> 03:11:41.838
I'll put it over here, actually.

4846
03:11:41.838 --> 03:11:44.812
TRAVIS: Yeah, Nott's far more an easier meal than me.

4847
03:11:44.812 --> 03:11:47.153
Oh, I hadn't seen it from the front.

4848
03:11:47.153 --> 03:11:49.140
MARISHA: It's got a dick nose!

4849
03:11:49.140 --> 03:11:50.715
LIAM: That's the proboscis!

4850
03:11:50.715 --> 03:11:55.338
MATT: As it swoops down, its long, pointed,

4851
03:11:55.338 --> 03:11:59.938
rapier-like face jams towards you.

4852
03:12:01.098 --> 03:12:03.995
That's going to be 19 to hit.

4853
03:12:03.995 --> 03:12:05.620
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits.
MATT: All righty.

4854
03:12:05.620 --> 03:12:07.215
ASHLEY: Look at that juicy butt.

4855
03:12:07.215 --> 03:12:08.390
MATT: You take--

4856
03:12:08.390 --> 03:12:10.968
ASHLEY: I want to eat that.

4857
03:12:10.968 --> 03:12:13.576
(laughter)

4858
03:12:13.576 --> 03:12:14.776
TRAVIS: Oh, Foster!

4859
03:12:14.776 --> 03:12:17.021
(laughter)

4860
03:12:17.021 --> 03:12:18.828
SAM: I think it's hair.

4861
03:12:18.828 --> 03:12:20.430
The hair makes this thing--

4862
03:12:20.430 --> 03:12:23.135
TRAVIS: We get a peek inside the old bedroom.

4863
03:12:23.135 --> 03:12:26.293
MATT: Landspeaker's going after this.

4864
03:12:26.293 --> 03:12:27.890
You take--

4865
03:12:27.890 --> 03:12:29.498
LIAM: Gimme dat butt.

4866
03:12:29.498 --> 03:12:30.854
ASHLEY: "Gimme dat butt. Liam O'Brien."

4867
03:12:30.854 --> 03:12:32.778
MATT: 16 points of piercing damage

4868
03:12:32.778 --> 03:12:35.819
as it jams into your clavicle and

4869
03:12:35.819 --> 03:12:37.925
pierces inside of you. You reach up with the other hand

4870
03:12:37.925 --> 03:12:38.831
and try and grab it and keep it

4871
03:12:38.831 --> 03:12:39.732
from piercing too deeply inside,

4872
03:12:39.732 --> 03:12:40.974
but it hurts like a motherfucker.

4873
03:12:40.974 --> 03:12:42.968
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4874
03:12:42.968 --> 03:12:45.721
Clavicle stabbing never feels good.

4875
03:12:45.721 --> 03:12:47.876
TALIESIN: No, it's about to do some sucking.

4876
03:12:47.876 --> 03:12:51.405
TRAVIS: What?!
MATT: You take an additional--

4877
03:12:51.405 --> 03:12:52.605
ASHLEY: We better not be fighting you.

4878
03:12:52.605 --> 03:12:54.271
LIAM: 30 points of acid strength.

4879
03:12:54.271 --> 03:12:55.962
MATT: 28 points of necrotic damage.

4880
03:12:55.962 --> 03:12:58.150
ALL: Oh!

4881
03:12:58.150 --> 03:13:00.282
MATT: Your hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount.

4882
03:13:00.282 --> 03:13:02.532
(yelling)

4883
03:13:02.532 --> 03:13:04.522
MARISHA: Shit!

4884
03:13:04.522 --> 03:13:05.631
SAM: Shit got real!

4885
03:13:05.631 --> 03:13:06.464
TRAVIS: Okay.

4886
03:13:06.464 --> 03:13:09.228
Temporary minus 20.

4887
03:13:09.228 --> 03:13:11.645
MATT: Minus 20 hit points. Your maximum hit points

4888
03:13:11.645 --> 03:13:14.002
are reduced by 28 and you take 28 damage.

4889
03:13:14.002 --> 03:13:14.835
LIAM: Are you at Caleb level?

4890
03:13:14.835 --> 03:13:17.250
TRAVIS: I'm at 60. Holy shit.

4891
03:13:17.250 --> 03:13:19.464
LIAM: Not quite! Not quite.

4892
03:13:19.464 --> 03:13:21.706
ASHLEY: Wait, what?

4893
03:13:21.706 --> 03:13:23.714
LIAM: My hit points are (descending slide whistle).

4894
03:13:23.714 --> 03:13:24.776
TALIESIN: 50's.

4895
03:13:24.776 --> 03:13:26.118
LIAM: I'm made of wet toilet paper and--

4896
03:13:26.118 --> 03:13:27.138
ASHLEY: Oh no!

4897
03:13:27.138 --> 03:13:28.825
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

4898
03:13:28.825 --> 03:13:30.360
MATT: That finishes its turn.

4899
03:13:30.360 --> 03:13:31.618
It is now Landspeaker's turn.

4900
03:13:31.618 --> 03:13:34.357
The Landspeaker, seeing the creatures

4901
03:13:34.357 --> 03:13:35.874
come out there begins to prepare and sees

4902
03:13:35.874 --> 03:13:39.207
the chasme fall and goes, "No, no, no!"

4903
03:13:40.352 --> 03:13:42.695
What you hear is (speaking Giant),

4904
03:13:42.695 --> 03:13:45.778
and brings up her staff is going to--

4905
03:13:47.105 --> 03:13:49.188
TALIESIN: Bring the pain.

4906
03:13:50.750 --> 03:13:52.072
MATT: Is going to grab one of the rocks out

4907
03:13:52.072 --> 03:13:55.537
of the side of the satchel and chuck it straight towards it.

4908
03:13:55.537 --> 03:13:57.802
TALIESIN: This is what the electric swatter is for.

4909
03:13:57.802 --> 03:13:58.785
MATT: That is--

4910
03:13:58.785 --> 03:13:59.873
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (electricity crackling)

4911
03:13:59.873 --> 03:14:04.586
MATT: No actually, that's a 16 to hit, which does hit.

4912
03:14:04.586 --> 03:14:06.142
TALIESIN: Mm, good to know.

4913
03:14:06.142 --> 03:14:09.887
MATT: Dealing 4d10 plus six damage.

4914
03:14:09.887 --> 03:14:10.720
LAURA: Nice.

4915
03:14:10.720 --> 03:14:11.553
TALIESIN: Yeah! Way to go.

4916
03:14:11.553 --> 03:14:13.328
MATT: Having a giant friend is not bad.

4917
03:14:13.328 --> 03:14:17.245
LIAM: All tens. Here they come. Ten, ten, ten. Ten.

4918
03:14:18.153 --> 03:14:21.830
MATT: Close! Three sevens and a nine. That's great.

4919
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:24.032
So 29, 30--

4920
03:14:24.032 --> 03:14:24.865
LIAM: 30?

4921
03:14:24.865 --> 03:14:28.232
MATT: 36 points of damage to the chasme.

4922
03:14:28.232 --> 03:14:30.065
TALIESIN: Good friend to have.

4923
03:14:31.007 --> 03:14:33.270
MATT: Yeah. She is going to,

4924
03:14:33.270 --> 03:14:35.128
after throwing it and beaming the creature.

4925
03:14:35.128 --> 03:14:40.128
(shrieking) (buzzing) That buzzing sound.

4926
03:14:40.133 --> 03:14:41.915
ASHLEY: (buzzing)

4927
03:14:41.915 --> 03:14:46.195
TRAVIS: (laughs) (imitating Ashley) Buh!

4928
03:14:46.195 --> 03:14:48.531
MATT: Seeing it turn to its space and head turned up

4929
03:14:48.531 --> 03:14:51.371
in the direction of the Landspeaker Soorna,

4930
03:14:51.371 --> 03:14:53.190
gets that look of fear in the eyes

4931
03:14:53.190 --> 03:14:54.819
and uses her movement to back

4932
03:14:54.819 --> 03:14:56.470
around this corner to protect herself

4933
03:14:56.470 --> 03:14:58.903
by reaching in and finding another boulder in her hand.

4934
03:14:58.903 --> 03:15:00.578
Top of the round. Beau, you're up.

4935
03:15:00.578 --> 03:15:04.727
MARISHA: All right. I'm going to do a barrel roll

4936
03:15:04.727 --> 03:15:07.391
and I'm going to get in between the two of these guys.

4937
03:15:07.391 --> 03:15:09.057
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Bless you.

4938
03:15:09.057 --> 03:15:11.457
MARISHA: And unleash a--

4939
03:15:11.457 --> 03:15:13.606
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

4940
03:15:13.606 --> 03:15:14.806
MARISHA: Why?

4941
03:15:14.806 --> 03:15:17.719
MATT: Because you step into the heat of the Wall of Fire.

4942
03:15:17.719 --> 03:15:20.419
LAURA: Oh.
MARISHA: Okay.

4943
03:15:20.419 --> 03:15:22.917
MATT: You roll and you're like, "Oh, that burns."

4944
03:15:22.917 --> 03:15:25.445
MARISHA: That's toasty. It's 23.

4945
03:15:25.445 --> 03:15:26.704
MATT: Okay, so take half damage.

4946
03:15:26.704 --> 03:15:27.778
Roll damage on that for me.

4947
03:15:27.778 --> 03:15:29.810
LIAM: Oh my gosh. New damage? Okay.

4948
03:15:29.810 --> 03:15:31.110
MARISHA: I didn't anticipate this.

4949
03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:32.393
LIAM: Oh, I rolled so high.

4950
03:15:32.393 --> 03:15:34.476
MARISHA: Why would you say that?

4951
03:15:34.476 --> 03:15:35.819
LIAM: 26.

4952
03:15:35.819 --> 03:15:37.597
MATT: Okay, so you take 13 points of fire damage.

4953
03:15:37.597 --> 03:15:38.430
SAM: Worth it.

4954
03:15:38.430 --> 03:15:40.123
MARISHA: That's fine.
SAM: Your hands are fire.

4955
03:15:40.123 --> 03:15:42.989
MARISHA: I look awesome and they're glowing

4956
03:15:42.989 --> 03:15:46.219
and I've got a Wall of Fire backlighting me.

4957
03:15:46.219 --> 03:15:47.052
MATT: Yep.

4958
03:15:47.052 --> 03:15:48.118
LIAM: Front lighting you, actually.

4959
03:15:48.118 --> 03:15:49.760
MATT: Generally lighting her.
MARISHA: It depends on

4960
03:15:49.760 --> 03:15:50.944
your perspective.

4961
03:15:50.944 --> 03:15:52.644
MATT: That's true.

4962
03:15:52.644 --> 03:15:53.618
From Caduceus' standpoint,

4963
03:15:53.618 --> 03:15:54.552
it looks pretty cool.

4964
03:15:54.552 --> 03:15:56.368
TALIESIN: It looks pretty cool.

4965
03:15:56.368 --> 03:16:01.234
MARISHA: Pop pop to the one to my right first.

4966
03:16:01.234 --> 03:16:02.688
MATT: Okay, go for it.

4967
03:16:02.688 --> 03:16:06.081
MARISHA: First one, eight. 20!

4968
03:16:06.081 --> 03:16:07.102
MATT: 20 hits.

4969
03:16:07.102 --> 03:16:10.102
MARISHA: Second one, yeah, 24.

4970
03:16:11.022 --> 03:16:12.211
MATT: Both hit.

4971
03:16:12.211 --> 03:16:13.726
MARISHA: Okay.

4972
03:16:13.726 --> 03:16:15.959
Roll both these damage.

4973
03:16:15.959 --> 03:16:18.534
So initial, ooh yeah!

4974
03:16:19.383 --> 03:16:20.441
22.

4975
03:16:20.441 --> 03:16:21.758
MATT: Plus the 2d6--

4976
03:16:21.758 --> 03:16:23.038
MARISHA: Plus my 2d8.

4977
03:16:23.038 --> 03:16:25.049
MATT: 2d8 per attack.

4978
03:16:25.049 --> 03:16:26.542
MARISHA: What did I say?

4979
03:16:26.542 --> 03:16:27.662
22 plus--

4980
03:16:27.662 --> 03:16:29.403
LIAM: (gasping)

4981
03:16:29.403 --> 03:16:32.718
MARISHA: It's seven and eight, so 15, plus--

4982
03:16:32.718 --> 03:16:34.321
LIAM: 37.

4983
03:16:34.321 --> 03:16:37.476
MARISHA: Not as cool, eight.

4984
03:16:37.476 --> 03:16:38.309
45.

4985
03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:39.705
MATT: 45 points of damage.

4986
03:16:39.705 --> 03:16:41.723
MARISHA: Pop pop!
LIAM: Goddamn.

4987
03:16:41.723 --> 03:16:44.808
TALIESIN: Is the radiant damage doing some--

4988
03:16:44.808 --> 03:16:46.553
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

4989
03:16:46.553 --> 03:16:47.956
MATT: Stunning Strike, okay.

4990
03:16:47.956 --> 03:16:49.278
LAURA: Ooh, wait, okay.

4991
03:16:49.278 --> 03:16:50.416
LIAM: Wicked deadly.

4992
03:16:50.416 --> 03:16:52.091
MARISHA: On the one.

4993
03:16:53.001 --> 03:16:56.053
It's fine. I've got ki points to spare.

4994
03:16:56.053 --> 03:16:57.407
LAURA: How many ki points you get?

4995
03:16:57.407 --> 03:16:58.365
MARISHA: Nine.

4996
03:16:58.365 --> 03:17:01.597
MATT: These are considered magical attacks.

4997
03:17:01.597 --> 03:17:02.855
TALIESIN: Yeah, they are magical attacks.

4998
03:17:02.855 --> 03:17:04.940
MATT: Yeah. You don't see the radiant

4999
03:17:04.940 --> 03:17:09.238
burning through, by any means.

5000
03:17:09.238 --> 03:17:14.215
The splashes and divine energy with strike

5001
03:17:14.215 --> 03:17:18.224
just flash throughout the entire chamber.

5002
03:17:18.224 --> 03:17:21.196
It's like seeing these bursts of light with each impact.

5003
03:17:21.196 --> 03:17:22.359
You said you're doing Stunning Strike?

5004
03:17:22.359 --> 03:17:24.311
MARISHA: Yep. On that one.

5005
03:17:24.311 --> 03:17:27.315
MATT: That's going to be a 16.

5006
03:17:27.315 --> 03:17:29.027
LAURA: Somebody get her some boots of haste.

5007
03:17:29.027 --> 03:17:30.002
MATT: What's your DC?

5008
03:17:30.002 --> 03:17:32.124
MARISHA: Fucking, fucking ball sacks.

5009
03:17:32.124 --> 03:17:33.125
Save.

5010
03:17:33.125 --> 03:17:34.140
MATT: Okay, so it succeeds.

5011
03:17:34.140 --> 03:17:35.468
You still have your bonus action.

5012
03:17:35.468 --> 03:17:40.450
MARISHA: I am going to very anime-esque

5013
03:17:40.450 --> 03:17:44.641
concentrate the ball of holy radiant chi

5014
03:17:44.641 --> 03:17:47.232
and I'm going to go boom boom,

5015
03:17:47.232 --> 03:17:50.919
Ip Man-style to the one to my left.

5016
03:17:50.919 --> 03:17:51.910
MATT: Go for it.

5017
03:17:51.910 --> 03:17:54.635
MARISHA: With a Flurry of Beaus.

5018
03:17:56.993 --> 03:17:58.467
TRAVIS: We'll work on the branding.

5019
03:17:58.467 --> 03:18:00.579
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. It's right there.

5020
03:18:00.579 --> 03:18:03.012
MARISHA: 19 for one.

5021
03:18:03.012 --> 03:18:04.284
Oh wait.

5022
03:18:04.284 --> 03:18:05.401
That's not right.

5023
03:18:05.401 --> 03:18:08.545
Oh, 19 and 21.

5024
03:18:08.545 --> 03:18:09.745
MATT: Both hit, roll damage for each.

5025
03:18:09.745 --> 03:18:11.047
This was on the other one.

5026
03:18:11.047 --> 03:18:12.804
MARISHA: This is on the other one.

5027
03:18:12.804 --> 03:18:16.845
So initial damage is ten plus nine.

5028
03:18:16.845 --> 03:18:18.852
So 19 plus--

5029
03:18:18.852 --> 03:18:20.801
TRAVIS: Fuck.
SAM: Still going?

5030
03:18:20.801 --> 03:18:23.468
MATT: Holy Weapon and monk, man.

5031
03:18:24.810 --> 03:18:25.968
MARISHA: Is that a, no, that's a three.

5032
03:18:25.968 --> 03:18:27.703
TALIESIN: Very high level spell.

5033
03:18:27.703 --> 03:18:30.066
MARISHA: Plus seven. Plus seven, plus...

5034
03:18:31.847 --> 03:18:32.844
Ooh, yeah.

5035
03:18:32.844 --> 03:18:37.037
It's an eight and a six plus--21.

5036
03:18:37.037 --> 03:18:39.536
Right? 21.

5037
03:18:39.536 --> 03:18:40.887
MATT: What was the original attack damage?

5038
03:18:40.887 --> 03:18:44.503
MARISHA: The original was 21

5039
03:18:44.503 --> 03:18:47.319
plus seven plus...

5040
03:18:48.762 --> 03:18:49.724
LAURA: Somebody should be writing this.

5041
03:18:49.724 --> 03:18:50.740
TALIESIN: I know, my brain is--

5042
03:18:50.740 --> 03:18:54.145
MARISHA: 21 plus seven plus, no, no.

5043
03:18:54.145 --> 03:18:54.978
LIAM: 20.

5044
03:18:54.978 --> 03:18:56.481
MARISHA: No, because I rolled two 11's combined.

5045
03:18:56.481 --> 03:18:58.105
LIAM: 21 plus seven is 28.

5046
03:18:58.105 --> 03:19:00.807
MARISHA: Plus an eight and a six for this last roll.

5047
03:19:00.807 --> 03:19:02.700
21 plus seven plus--

5048
03:19:02.700 --> 03:19:03.542
LAURA: 14.

5049
03:19:03.542 --> 03:19:04.928
MARISHA: 14, thank you.

5050
03:19:04.928 --> 03:19:06.570
21, seven, 14.

5051
03:19:06.570 --> 03:19:09.323
MATT: Gotcha. So 42.

5052
03:19:09.323 --> 03:19:11.445
MARISHA: Yeah.

5053
03:19:11.445 --> 03:19:12.533
A Flurry of Blows.

5054
03:19:12.533 --> 03:19:14.533
MATT: All right so, (pummeling) to one

5055
03:19:14.533 --> 03:19:16.149
and then (whamming) to both of them.

5056
03:19:16.149 --> 03:19:17.552
You blast into each.

5057
03:19:17.552 --> 03:19:19.008
They're both looking pretty hurt.

5058
03:19:19.008 --> 03:19:22.212
You also Extracting Aspects pull from them

5059
03:19:22.212 --> 03:19:26.631
that they are resistant to cold, fire, and lightning;

5060
03:19:26.631 --> 03:19:27.644
as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing

5061
03:19:27.644 --> 03:19:29.020
from nonmagical attacks.

5062
03:19:29.020 --> 03:19:30.375
MARISHA: Okay.

5063
03:19:30.375 --> 03:19:32.418
I shout really fast.

5064
03:19:32.418 --> 03:19:35.092
MATT: They are immune to poison,

5065
03:19:35.092 --> 03:19:37.250
and they cannot be poisoned.

5066
03:19:37.250 --> 03:19:39.495
You learn that as you focus

5067
03:19:39.495 --> 03:19:43.111
your chi in and pull out elements

5068
03:19:43.111 --> 03:19:44.944
of their physicality and learn those facets in the back

5069
03:19:44.944 --> 03:19:47.569
of your mind.
MARISHA: Nonmagic immune and then cold--?

5070
03:19:47.569 --> 03:19:48.786
MATT: Fire and lightning.

5071
03:19:48.786 --> 03:19:51.660
MARISHA: Fire, lightning.

5072
03:19:51.660 --> 03:19:52.493
MATT: Immune to poisoning.

5073
03:19:52.493 --> 03:19:53.326
MARISHA: And poison.

5074
03:19:53.326 --> 03:19:54.992
LIAM: Point of clarification.
MATT: Yes?

5075
03:19:54.992 --> 03:19:56.623
LIAM: For future reference,

5076
03:19:56.623 --> 03:20:00.069
people who end their turn within ten feet

5077
03:20:00.069 --> 03:20:01.631
of the fire wall get burned. So on

5078
03:20:01.631 --> 03:20:03.993
a future turn, she could jump in,

5079
03:20:03.993 --> 03:20:05.631
punch, punch, punch and jump out,

5080
03:20:05.631 --> 03:20:07.489
risk attacks of opportunity, but escape

5081
03:20:07.489 --> 03:20:09.769
the burn if she jumped in and out.

5082
03:20:09.769 --> 03:20:10.788
Because the burning happens at

5083
03:20:10.788 --> 03:20:13.368
the end of your turn if you get into it.

5084
03:20:13.368 --> 03:20:17.535
MATT: I think there's a "or the first time you enter it"?

5085
03:20:19.238 --> 03:20:20.071
TALIESIN: I know.

5086
03:20:20.071 --> 03:20:23.479
TRAVIS: It's a giant butane wall of fucking pain and hurt.

5087
03:20:23.479 --> 03:20:25.844
MARISHA: If I can, though, can I take a step--

5088
03:20:25.844 --> 03:20:30.086
LIAM: When the wall appears, each creature makes the throw,

5089
03:20:30.086 --> 03:20:33.411
but then after it appears it's at the end of your--

5090
03:20:33.411 --> 03:20:34.729
I mean, it's barely different, but would

5091
03:20:34.729 --> 03:20:36.927
it be at the end of Beau's turn in the future?

5092
03:20:36.927 --> 03:20:38.388
I think right now she should burn because it's funny.

5093
03:20:38.388 --> 03:20:40.010
MATT: (reading) "Or when it enters the wall

5094
03:20:40.010 --> 03:20:41.676
"for the first time on their turn."

5095
03:20:41.676 --> 03:20:42.867
LIAM: For the first time on their turn?

5096
03:20:42.867 --> 03:20:45.474
MATT: Yes. So when you enter it, meaning if somebody's

5097
03:20:45.474 --> 03:20:47.065
already in the fire, they don't take it

5098
03:20:47.065 --> 03:20:47.923
at the top of their turn.

5099
03:20:47.923 --> 03:20:48.906
They have a chance to leave it.

5100
03:20:48.906 --> 03:20:50.156
LIAM: Cool, cool, cool.

5101
03:20:50.156 --> 03:20:52.984
MARISHA: Can I take five feet back and not leave the range?

5102
03:20:52.984 --> 03:20:53.817
MATT: Yes, you can.

5103
03:20:53.817 --> 03:20:55.013
You still take the damage, but you can back out.

5104
03:20:55.013 --> 03:20:55.846
MARISHA: That's fine.

5105
03:20:55.846 --> 03:20:57.760
MATT: That guy can take attack opportunity on you, though.

5106
03:20:57.760 --> 03:20:59.679
MARISHA: I said not leave the range, but that's fine.

5107
03:20:59.679 --> 03:21:01.561
MATT: Well, you have to if you're going to take a step back.

5108
03:21:01.561 --> 03:21:03.094
MARISHA: Fine.
MATT: Are you going to do it or not?

5109
03:21:03.094 --> 03:21:04.144
MARISHA: Yep.

5110
03:21:04.144 --> 03:21:05.635
TRAVIS: You'll take the attack of opportunity. Like it.

5111
03:21:05.635 --> 03:21:06.818
MATT: This guy's going to reach out

5112
03:21:06.818 --> 03:21:09.556
and slice at you with his claw.

5113
03:21:09.556 --> 03:21:11.535
And rolls an natural two. He misses.

5114
03:21:11.535 --> 03:21:13.009
MARISHA: Fact. Yeah.

5115
03:21:13.009 --> 03:21:14.372
MATT: Just slap it out of the way with your divine hand.

5116
03:21:14.372 --> 03:21:15.205
TRAVIS: Ow, bitch.

5117
03:21:15.205 --> 03:21:16.885
MATT: That finishes your turn, Beau?

5118
03:21:16.885 --> 03:21:19.575
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5119
03:21:19.575 --> 03:21:20.791
MATT: Now it's their turn.

5120
03:21:20.791 --> 03:21:21.624
TRAVIS: A lot of shit happened.

5121
03:21:21.624 --> 03:21:22.798
TALIESIN: They take--
LAURA: Wisdom saving throw.

5122
03:21:22.798 --> 03:21:24.123
MATT: Yes, they do.

5123
03:21:24.123 --> 03:21:26.066
TALIESIN: And fire.

5124
03:21:26.066 --> 03:21:31.066
MATT: Two plus five, seven on one and 13 on the other.

5125
03:21:31.293 --> 03:21:32.676
LAURA: Ha ha, they both fail.

5126
03:21:32.676 --> 03:21:33.509
MATT: Roll damage.
TRAVIS: Yeah!

5127
03:21:33.509 --> 03:21:34.595
TALIESIN: Hurt them.

5128
03:21:34.595 --> 03:21:36.763
ASHLEY: ♪ Yeah yeah ♪

5129
03:21:36.763 --> 03:21:39.706
TRAVIS: ♪ Make them squirm in their own skin ♪

5130
03:21:39.706 --> 03:21:42.959
LAURA: Mm, 12 points of radiant damage.

5131
03:21:42.959 --> 03:21:45.275
MATT: 12 for each, nice.

5132
03:21:45.275 --> 03:21:46.457
They're both assaulted. All

5133
03:21:46.457 --> 03:21:48.734
the floating unicorns go (whinnying)

5134
03:21:48.734 --> 03:21:52.130
and burst into both and piercing in different places.

5135
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:53.036
Like, (screeching)--

5136
03:21:53.036 --> 03:21:55.454
LAURA: Like if you're in one of those paint fights

5137
03:21:55.454 --> 03:21:59.418
with the powder paint that's like poof, poof, poof.

5138
03:21:59.418 --> 03:22:02.108
The Color Runs, that's what their called.

5139
03:22:02.108 --> 03:22:03.410
MATT: This one's going to move

5140
03:22:03.410 --> 03:22:04.841
out of the flames here and move around

5141
03:22:04.841 --> 03:22:07.918
to get in between Jester and Caduceus

5142
03:22:07.918 --> 03:22:09.497
and stay in range with Beau.

5143
03:22:09.497 --> 03:22:11.875
You do get an attack opportunity technically, Caduceus,

5144
03:22:11.875 --> 03:22:13.534
if you want to swing with your staff.

5145
03:22:13.534 --> 03:22:14.696
TALIESIN: I do, I actually can use a spell.

5146
03:22:14.696 --> 03:22:16.355
MATT: Oh, because you took--

5147
03:22:16.355 --> 03:22:17.838
TALIESIN: War Caster.

5148
03:22:17.838 --> 03:22:19.233
MATT: Yeah, what are you going to do?

5149
03:22:19.233 --> 03:22:20.377
MARISHA: That's the best.

5150
03:22:20.377 --> 03:22:22.217
TALIESIN: I'm not going to do anything too fancy.

5151
03:22:22.217 --> 03:22:23.854
I'm going to take a Sacred--

5152
03:22:23.854 --> 03:22:25.715
no, I can't do the Sacred Flame, can I?

5153
03:22:25.715 --> 03:22:26.865
MATT: It's a spell cantrip.

5154
03:22:26.865 --> 03:22:27.854
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right.

5155
03:22:27.854 --> 03:22:29.745
MATT: That rolled a...

5156
03:22:31.415 --> 03:22:32.391
ten on its DC.

5157
03:22:32.391 --> 03:22:34.414
TALIESIN: No.
MATT: Roll damage. Go for it.

5158
03:22:34.414 --> 03:22:38.341
TALIESIN: That doesn't help. So that's--

5159
03:22:38.341 --> 03:22:39.657
that's pretty good.

5160
03:22:39.657 --> 03:22:41.081
14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

5161
03:22:41.081 --> 03:22:43.177
That's 19 points of radiant damage.

5162
03:22:43.177 --> 03:22:46.022
MATT: 19 points radiant. Oof, it's looking hurt (laughs).

5163
03:22:46.022 --> 03:22:48.894
It's like (slicing) (grunting)

5164
03:22:48.894 --> 03:22:51.219
and it's going to unload into you,

5165
03:22:51.219 --> 03:22:52.197
as you just blasted as it.

5166
03:22:52.197 --> 03:22:53.321
It was going to go around towards Jester,

5167
03:22:53.321 --> 03:22:54.335
but then as you hit it, it turns towards you

5168
03:22:54.335 --> 03:22:57.454
and it's going to unleash both slashing attacks.

5169
03:22:57.454 --> 03:22:59.429
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

5170
03:22:59.429 --> 03:23:01.257
MATT: Oh, did not roll well.

5171
03:23:01.257 --> 03:23:03.007
That's going to be a ten.

5172
03:23:04.174 --> 03:23:05.650
TALIESIN: No.

5173
03:23:05.650 --> 03:23:07.390
MATT: And a 16.

5174
03:23:07.390 --> 03:23:08.223
TALIESIN: No.

5175
03:23:08.223 --> 03:23:10.531
MATT: Yep. You knock away the shield.

5176
03:23:10.531 --> 03:23:12.297
TALIESIN: I'm feeling it. I've got a zone.

5177
03:23:12.297 --> 03:23:15.630
MATT: This one here is going to move in.

5178
03:23:16.985 --> 03:23:18.126
TALIESIN: Going into--yeah.

5179
03:23:18.126 --> 03:23:20.745
MATT: It's going to try and leave the--it's fine with fire.

5180
03:23:20.745 --> 03:23:22.185
Fire doesn't bother it too much.

5181
03:23:22.185 --> 03:23:25.102
It's going to-after watching

5182
03:23:25.102 --> 03:23:26.745
you blast into its friends, it's

5183
03:23:26.745 --> 03:23:28.366
going to go both strokes against you.

5184
03:23:28.366 --> 03:23:30.382
SAM: No.
MARISHA: Come at me, bro.

5185
03:23:31.622 --> 03:23:32.782
MATT: 23.
SAM: Come at me, Breau-regard.

5186
03:23:32.782 --> 03:23:34.994
MARISHA: Come at me, Beau.

5187
03:23:34.994 --> 03:23:36.795
MATT: 23. Two 23s in a row.

5188
03:23:36.795 --> 03:23:39.406
MARISHA: Okay. (repeatedly) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5189
03:23:39.406 --> 03:23:41.248
MATT: The first strike is going to

5190
03:23:41.248 --> 03:23:44.665
be 12 points of slashing damage.

5191
03:23:44.665 --> 03:23:47.406
And ten points of slashing damage.

5192
03:23:47.406 --> 03:23:48.627
A total of 22.

5193
03:23:48.627 --> 03:23:49.502
(slashing)

5194
03:23:49.502 --> 03:23:51.625
Blood splatter on the ground.

5195
03:23:51.625 --> 03:23:54.250
It claws across one side of Beau's face and the other side

5196
03:23:54.250 --> 03:23:55.865
goes across the arm and the shoulder tearing down.

5197
03:23:55.865 --> 03:23:58.523
There's now this red slowly pouring

5198
03:23:58.523 --> 03:24:00.531
out of the side and on the side of her cheek.

5199
03:24:00.531 --> 03:24:03.587
The creature runs its dark tongue across its teeth

5200
03:24:03.587 --> 03:24:06.554
after it gets the blood--
MARISHA: I (hissing).

5201
03:24:06.554 --> 03:24:08.044
MATT: (hissing)

5202
03:24:08.044 --> 03:24:10.469
It's going to

5203
03:24:10.469 --> 03:24:13.448
make a Weakening Gaze against you.

5204
03:24:13.448 --> 03:24:15.123
SAM: You're not wearing lipstick. That's just the

5205
03:24:15.123 --> 03:24:16.472
beautiful color of your lips.

5206
03:24:16.472 --> 03:24:19.182
MARISHA: I woke up like this.

5207
03:24:19.182 --> 03:24:20.158
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

5208
03:24:20.158 --> 03:24:21.741
SAM: It doesn't look smeary.

5209
03:24:22.845 --> 03:24:23.678
It looks fine.

5210
03:24:23.678 --> 03:24:25.078
MARISHA: I definitely smeared it on my arm.

5211
03:24:25.078 --> 03:24:26.662
As long as it's not on my face.

5212
03:24:26.662 --> 03:24:28.762
SAM: No, face is fine.

5213
03:24:28.762 --> 03:24:30.262
ASHLEY: That would be a one.

5214
03:24:30.262 --> 03:24:32.951
MATT: The weakness overtakes you once more.

5215
03:24:32.951 --> 03:24:34.384
Drained of its energy and life.

5216
03:24:34.384 --> 03:24:35.386
SAM: Yashly!

5217
03:24:35.386 --> 03:24:36.219
MATT: It's going to sit there

5218
03:24:36.219 --> 03:24:38.077
and endure the flames for the rest of its turn.

5219
03:24:38.077 --> 03:24:40.619
That ends its go. Jester and Caleb, you guys are up.

5220
03:24:40.619 --> 03:24:44.120
LIAM: I went first the last time.
LAURA: Okay, well then--

5221
03:24:44.120 --> 03:24:45.170
LIAM: You can take this turn.
LAURA: Okay.

5222
03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:46.645
MATT: Just reminding myself of concentration.

5223
03:24:46.645 --> 03:24:48.892
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

5224
03:24:48.892 --> 03:24:51.923
LAURA: I'm going to see the dude coming down

5225
03:24:51.923 --> 03:24:53.742
and attacking Fjord.

5226
03:24:53.742 --> 03:24:54.575
MATT: Yes.

5227
03:24:54.575 --> 03:24:57.194
LAURA: I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon at it.

5228
03:24:57.194 --> 03:24:58.869
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: Yay, lollipop!

5229
03:24:58.869 --> 03:25:01.272
MATT: (whooshing) (landing)

5230
03:25:01.272 --> 03:25:03.464
Go ahead and roll for the attack.

5231
03:25:04.817 --> 03:25:05.710
LAURA: Okay.

5232
03:25:05.710 --> 03:25:07.251
MATT: Okay, actually this is a valid point.

5233
03:25:07.251 --> 03:25:09.251
I have to remember this.

5234
03:25:13.837 --> 03:25:14.670
Fuck.

5235
03:25:14.670 --> 03:25:15.846
Beau and Jester--

5236
03:25:15.846 --> 03:25:17.728
MARISHA: Yeah?
MATT: Can I have you both make

5237
03:25:17.728 --> 03:25:19.888
a constitution saving throw for me, please?

5238
03:25:19.888 --> 03:25:20.827
SAM: Hmm.

5239
03:25:20.827 --> 03:25:21.660
MARISHA: Saving throw?

5240
03:25:21.660 --> 03:25:22.885
MATT: Yes.

5241
03:25:22.885 --> 03:25:24.753
LAURA: Why?
MARISHA: Yeah, why?

5242
03:25:24.753 --> 03:25:25.586
MATT: You'll find out.

5243
03:25:25.586 --> 03:25:26.419
SAM: Yours is not to know.

5244
03:25:26.419 --> 03:25:29.642
LIAM: Have the buggies attacked yet?

5245
03:25:29.642 --> 03:25:30.475
MARISHA: 18.

5246
03:25:30.475 --> 03:25:33.312
LAURA: God, that was almost so good. 11.

5247
03:25:33.312 --> 03:25:34.978
MATT: Gotcha. So 18.

5248
03:25:34.978 --> 03:25:36.989
That buzzing sound that's filling the chamber,

5249
03:25:36.989 --> 03:25:38.512
you're like, "Ugh," there's something

5250
03:25:38.512 --> 03:25:40.555
about it that's getting your ear, but you shrug it off.

5251
03:25:40.555 --> 03:25:44.239
Jester, your Spiritual Weapon does not get cast.

5252
03:25:44.239 --> 03:25:45.742
Because as you turn to cast it

5253
03:25:45.742 --> 03:25:47.022
that buzzing noise fills your mind,

5254
03:25:47.022 --> 03:25:50.478
your eyes lull and you fall unconscious.

5255
03:25:50.478 --> 03:25:52.453
SAM: (yelling)

5256
03:25:53.819 --> 03:25:56.394
TRAVIS: What the fuck happened?

5257
03:25:56.394 --> 03:25:58.194
TALIESIN: Not zero hit points, but fall unconscious.

5258
03:25:58.194 --> 03:26:01.526
MATT: Just fall unconscious. You're unconscious.

5259
03:26:01.526 --> 03:26:04.727
LIAM: Wouldn't I have to make that same save?

5260
03:26:04.727 --> 03:26:05.919
MATT: When we get to your turn, yes.

5261
03:26:05.919 --> 03:26:07.743
LIAM: Oh, okay.
MATT: Which we do right now.

5262
03:26:07.743 --> 03:26:08.993
LIAM: I have a question, though.

5263
03:26:08.993 --> 03:26:11.260
Did the three bug critters have their turn, right?

5264
03:26:11.260 --> 03:26:12.093
MATT: Yes, they did.

5265
03:26:12.093 --> 03:26:13.932
LIAM: There's one that's still in range of that fire wall.

5266
03:26:13.932 --> 03:26:15.258
MATT: Yes, he does, so roll damage for it.

5267
03:26:15.258 --> 03:26:16.091
LIAM: Yeah.

5268
03:26:16.091 --> 03:26:18.133
MATT: Saving throw. Does not make it.

5269
03:26:18.133 --> 03:26:21.300
MARISHA: Not it was just two--why us?

5270
03:26:22.454 --> 03:26:23.612
LIAM: 30 total.

5271
03:26:23.612 --> 03:26:24.445
MATT: 30 total.

5272
03:26:24.445 --> 03:26:26.056
SAM: You had just moved and she was about to move.

5273
03:26:26.056 --> 03:26:28.689
It'll probably happen to Caleb, too.

5274
03:26:28.689 --> 03:26:30.313
When it's his turn.

5275
03:26:30.313 --> 03:26:31.579
LAURA: I guess whenever--

5276
03:26:31.579 --> 03:26:33.170
MATT: It's looking real bad.

5277
03:26:33.170 --> 03:26:34.907
It was looking real bad (laughs).

5278
03:26:34.907 --> 03:26:35.740
TRAVIS: Who is?

5279
03:26:35.740 --> 03:26:37.664
MATT: The one that's behind Caduceus.

5280
03:26:37.664 --> 03:26:39.648
The one that just got burned by the flames.

5281
03:26:39.648 --> 03:26:41.431
TRAVIS: Are they both [inaudible] or

5282
03:26:41.431 --> 03:26:42.368
the buzzing's coming from Nosy.

5283
03:26:42.368 --> 03:26:45.057
MARISHA: It's got to be from Nosy face.

5284
03:26:45.057 --> 03:26:46.723
MATT: Wait, that was the other one, sorry.

5285
03:26:46.723 --> 03:26:47.556
They're both looking pretty rough.

5286
03:26:47.556 --> 03:26:48.955
LAURA: Here's my question. Is it at the end of your turn

5287
03:26:48.955 --> 03:26:50.021
of the beginning of your turn?

5288
03:26:50.021 --> 03:26:52.229
MATT: The beginning of your turn.
LAURA: So--

5289
03:26:52.229 --> 03:26:53.387
TALIESIN: You would have not cast the--

5290
03:26:53.387 --> 03:26:54.625
LAURA: All the stuff that Beau did--

5291
03:26:54.625 --> 03:26:57.046
MATT: Would've gone back if she had not made the save.

5292
03:26:57.046 --> 03:26:59.089
LAURA: Got it.

5293
03:26:59.089 --> 03:27:00.775
Okay, so I didn't even try

5294
03:27:00.775 --> 03:27:02.278
to cast the spell, I just immediately went out.

5295
03:27:02.278 --> 03:27:04.192
MATT: You didn't have the opportunity, yeah.

5296
03:27:04.192 --> 03:27:05.951
MARISHA: Kill Nosy face.

5297
03:27:05.951 --> 03:27:07.968
MATT: Yeah. A creature that starts it turn

5298
03:27:07.968 --> 03:27:10.009
within 30 feet of the chasme.

5299
03:27:10.009 --> 03:27:12.470
LAURA: Was it wisdom or constitution?

5300
03:27:12.470 --> 03:27:14.004
MATT: Constitution.
LAURA: Okay.

5301
03:27:14.004 --> 03:27:14.995
SAM: Damn.

5302
03:27:14.995 --> 03:27:17.978
MATT: Jester falls. Caleb, make constitution saving throw.

5303
03:27:17.978 --> 03:27:20.307
LIAM: Okay so, with my transmuter's stone, I have

5304
03:27:20.307 --> 03:27:24.227
advantage and I add my con and my proficiency.

5305
03:27:24.227 --> 03:27:26.561
MATT: Wait. You have advantage on it because?

5306
03:27:26.561 --> 03:27:28.848
LIAM: Because of the transmuter's stone.

5307
03:27:28.848 --> 03:27:29.854
MATT: It gives you both?

5308
03:27:29.854 --> 03:27:33.230
You could add proficiency or advantage or both?

5309
03:27:33.230 --> 03:27:35.461
LIAM: D&amp;D Beyond is saying advantage made to maintain--

5310
03:27:35.461 --> 03:27:36.483
oh, War Caster.

5311
03:27:36.483 --> 03:27:38.126
MATT: War Caster gives you to maintain spells.

5312
03:27:38.126 --> 03:27:38.968
This isn't about that.

5313
03:27:38.968 --> 03:27:39.801
LIAM: What is this?

5314
03:27:39.801 --> 03:27:42.754
MATT: You get advantage to maintain concentration.

5315
03:27:42.754 --> 03:27:44.438
LIAM: Oh, okay.
MATT: You don't get it every time.

5316
03:27:44.438 --> 03:27:45.271
LIAM: Just constitution?

5317
03:27:45.271 --> 03:27:46.278
MATT: Correct. You roll constitution throw and

5318
03:27:46.278 --> 03:27:48.661
add your proficiency bonus.
LIAM: Okay.

5319
03:27:48.661 --> 03:27:49.494
MATT: Because of your stone.

5320
03:27:49.494 --> 03:27:50.760
TRAVIS: This is a problem.

5321
03:27:50.760 --> 03:27:51.593
LIAM: 15.

5322
03:27:51.593 --> 03:27:53.342
MATT: You resist it, so you start your turn.

5323
03:27:53.342 --> 03:27:54.473
TALIESIN: Oh man.

5324
03:27:54.473 --> 03:27:55.664
MATT: You're like (whooshing) for a second.

5325
03:27:55.664 --> 03:27:56.995
You're like, "Oh!"

5326
03:27:56.995 --> 03:27:58.936
Your vision begins to go dull

5327
03:27:58.936 --> 03:28:00.788
and you're like, "Oh god! (exhale)"

5328
03:28:00.788 --> 03:28:05.766
You refocus and turn back towards the flames to the side.

5329
03:28:05.766 --> 03:28:08.334
LIAM: Looking left and right, I leave the wall up,

5330
03:28:08.334 --> 03:28:11.150
I pull out of the adder's bladder

5331
03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:15.811
and I draw back and loose an acid arrow

5332
03:28:15.811 --> 03:28:17.756
towards this thing near Fjord.

5333
03:28:17.756 --> 03:28:19.449
MATT: All righty.
LIAM: That's an attack.

5334
03:28:19.449 --> 03:28:21.282
MATT: Make an attack roll.

5335
03:28:22.476 --> 03:28:24.435
LIAM: 14.
MATT: 14 does not hit.

5336
03:28:24.435 --> 03:28:27.555
LIAM: It will still be a--hmm, what does it do?

5337
03:28:27.555 --> 03:28:29.761
It takes half damage.

5338
03:28:29.761 --> 03:28:31.214
Excuse me one second.

5339
03:28:31.214 --> 03:28:34.631
Digga, digga, digga.

5340
03:28:36.975 --> 03:28:38.604
SAM: Are you unconscious or just weak?

5341
03:28:38.604 --> 03:28:40.663
LIAM: On a hit, target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately

5342
03:28:40.663 --> 03:28:42.400
and 2ds for the next round. On a miss,

5343
03:28:42.400 --> 03:28:44.960
the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much.

5344
03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:46.606
MATT: Roll 2d4 acid damage.

5345
03:28:46.606 --> 03:28:48.563
LIAM: Yeah, and nothing on the next turn.

5346
03:28:48.563 --> 03:28:49.396
MATT: Correct.

5347
03:28:50.404 --> 03:28:51.795
LIAM: That is just three.

5348
03:28:51.795 --> 03:28:52.787
MATT: Three acid damage.

5349
03:28:52.787 --> 03:28:53.620
(whooshing)

5350
03:28:53.620 --> 03:28:54.453
Which--

5351
03:28:54.453 --> 03:28:58.235
LIAM: Is nothing and I will,

5352
03:28:58.235 --> 03:29:02.525
move that way just out of sight just beyond that wall.

5353
03:29:02.525 --> 03:29:03.368
I'll hug the wall.

5354
03:29:03.368 --> 03:29:04.243
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30--

5355
03:29:04.243 --> 03:29:07.608
LIAM: Too far. Maybe ten feet past the edge.

5356
03:29:07.608 --> 03:29:09.391
MATT: There?
LIAM: Yeah.

5357
03:29:09.391 --> 03:29:11.235
That's where I will end.

5358
03:29:11.235 --> 03:29:13.469
MATT: Okay, cool. That ends your turn, Caleb.

5359
03:29:13.469 --> 03:29:15.610
Caduceus, it's your turn.

5360
03:29:15.610 --> 03:29:17.543
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

5361
03:29:17.543 --> 03:29:19.540
TRAVIS: I'm so nervous now!

5362
03:29:19.540 --> 03:29:20.637
TALIESIN: You should be; my constitution is not great.

5363
03:29:20.637 --> 03:29:23.379
MATT: (buzzing)

5364
03:29:23.379 --> 03:29:24.477
TALIESIN: I'm really within 30 feet of them?

5365
03:29:24.477 --> 03:29:26.562
MATT: You are just within 30 feet.

5366
03:29:27.503 --> 03:29:30.312
TALIESIN: Come on. Hey. 15.

5367
03:29:30.312 --> 03:29:33.281
MATT: You manage to shrug off the effects

5368
03:29:33.281 --> 03:29:35.464
of its demonic wing beating

5369
03:29:35.464 --> 03:29:37.560
that is causing your brain to shut down.

5370
03:29:37.560 --> 03:29:40.448
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's not okay.

5371
03:29:40.448 --> 03:29:41.281
All right.

5372
03:29:41.281 --> 03:29:42.295
LAURA: Kill it.

5373
03:29:42.295 --> 03:29:44.452
TALIESIN: I'm engaged with two

5374
03:29:44.452 --> 03:29:45.597
of these things right now, right?

5375
03:29:45.597 --> 03:29:49.386
MATT: Do mark, though, for Beau, Caleb, and Caduceus.

5376
03:29:49.386 --> 03:29:50.845
You guys are immune to the effect

5377
03:29:50.845 --> 03:29:52.464
for the next 24 hours now that you've succeeded.

5378
03:29:52.464 --> 03:29:55.022
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Oh!

5379
03:29:55.022 --> 03:29:56.806
MATT: Mark that with a note.

5380
03:29:56.806 --> 03:29:59.847
ASHLEY: How nice.
LIAM: I'll just remember it.

5381
03:29:59.847 --> 03:30:00.922
MATT: What are you doing?

5382
03:30:00.922 --> 03:30:02.000
TALIESIN: Well, I'm engaged with

5383
03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:03.379
these two right now, aren't I?

5384
03:30:03.379 --> 03:30:07.880
MATT: You are. They actually have you pincered.

5385
03:30:07.880 --> 03:30:09.498
TALIESIN: They have me pincered.

5386
03:30:09.498 --> 03:30:10.578
Are they looking rough or are they not looking rough?

5387
03:30:10.578 --> 03:30:13.015
MATT: They're both looking pretty rough, yeah (laughs).

5388
03:30:13.015 --> 03:30:14.595
Between Beau's bludgeoning

5389
03:30:14.595 --> 03:30:16.723
both of them terribly and flames

5390
03:30:16.723 --> 03:30:18.920
burning from one side, they're both looking pretty bad.

5391
03:30:18.920 --> 03:30:20.339
TALIESIN: Okay, there's nothing I can

5392
03:30:20.339 --> 03:30:22.019
really do to both of them right now, is there?

5393
03:30:22.019 --> 03:30:24.236
I'm going to do a--

5394
03:30:24.236 --> 03:30:26.335
I really don't have a lot of options here.

5395
03:30:26.335 --> 03:30:29.933
I guess Sacred Flame is what I got right now.

5396
03:30:29.933 --> 03:30:31.096
MATT: Okay, to which one?

5397
03:30:31.096 --> 03:30:33.493
TALIESIN: Let's do the one to my right.

5398
03:30:33.493 --> 03:30:34.797
The one that's actually

5399
03:30:34.797 --> 03:30:37.196
over here--yeah, that.
MATT: This one? Okay.

5400
03:30:37.196 --> 03:30:39.256
That's a natural 20, so it succeeds.

5401
03:30:39.256 --> 03:30:40.089
Roll damage.

5402
03:30:40.089 --> 03:30:41.598
TALIESIN: He still takes half damage, right?

5403
03:30:41.598 --> 03:30:42.431
MATT: Yes.

5404
03:30:42.431 --> 03:30:44.689
TALIESIN: All right, that's okay.

5405
03:30:44.689 --> 03:30:45.522
Ten, 15.

5406
03:30:46.357 --> 03:30:47.219
MATT: 15?

5407
03:30:47.219 --> 03:30:48.052
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5408
03:30:48.052 --> 03:30:48.885
MATT: Yeah, he's done.

5409
03:30:48.885 --> 03:30:49.859
(explosion)

5410
03:30:49.859 --> 03:30:50.692
SAM: Yeah!

5411
03:30:50.692 --> 03:30:51.977
MATT: He was hurt pretty bad

5412
03:30:51.977 --> 03:30:53.631
and, as soon as he turned back, he kind

5413
03:30:53.631 --> 03:30:55.038
of moved your shield out of the way,

5414
03:30:55.038 --> 03:30:56.377
staff goes forward, you release the energy

5415
03:30:56.377 --> 03:30:58.814
and the flames burn around it.

5416
03:30:58.814 --> 03:31:00.778
Its leathery body suddenly begins

5417
03:31:00.778 --> 03:31:02.632
to shrivel up and it shrieks

5418
03:31:02.632 --> 03:31:04.590
as it crumples into a ball of ash

5419
03:31:04.590 --> 03:31:06.265
and (whooshing) across the ground.

5420
03:31:06.265 --> 03:31:09.145
TALIESIN: Okay, I cannot cast a spell as a bonus action

5421
03:31:09.145 --> 03:31:11.747
right now unless it's a cantrip, I assume.

5422
03:31:11.747 --> 03:31:14.771
MATT: Well no, you can because you used your Sacred Flame

5423
03:31:14.771 --> 03:31:15.604
which is a cantrip.

5424
03:31:15.604 --> 03:31:17.171
Bonus action you cast any spell you want.

5425
03:31:17.171 --> 03:31:21.654
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a little--nah,

5426
03:31:21.654 --> 03:31:24.381
I don't know if I can wake her up.

5427
03:31:24.381 --> 03:31:26.179
He gets an attack of opportunity also

5428
03:31:26.179 --> 03:31:27.320
if I try and walk away from him.

5429
03:31:27.320 --> 03:31:28.487
MATT: He does.

5430
03:31:29.443 --> 03:31:30.276
TALIESIN: Um.

5431
03:31:31.387 --> 03:31:32.512
Shizz.

5432
03:31:32.512 --> 03:31:36.645
(dramatic music)

5433
03:31:36.645 --> 03:31:37.514
TALIESIN: You know what?

5434
03:31:37.514 --> 03:31:40.195
I'm so sorry I'm taking so long.

5435
03:31:42.295 --> 03:31:45.149
Yeah, I'm going to...

5436
03:31:45.149 --> 03:31:47.525
Am I touching Jester or no?

5437
03:31:47.525 --> 03:31:49.020
MATT: You are next to her, yeah.

5438
03:31:49.878 --> 03:31:51.467
TALIESIN: I can't Remove Curse. That is--

5439
03:31:51.467 --> 03:31:52.333
Okay.

5440
03:31:52.333 --> 03:31:53.440
TRAVIS: Is it a curse?

5441
03:31:53.440 --> 03:31:56.428
TALIESIN: I'm going to try a little,

5442
03:31:56.428 --> 03:31:59.600
just to see if it wakes her up, a little Mass

5443
03:31:59.600 --> 03:32:01.419
Healing Word to see if it does.

5444
03:32:01.419 --> 03:32:04.000
Oh wait, that's level--that's too big.

5445
03:32:04.000 --> 03:32:04.913
Just a little--

5446
03:32:04.913 --> 03:32:05.746
ASHLEY: Regular Healing Word?

5447
03:32:05.746 --> 03:32:06.579
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5448
03:32:06.579 --> 03:32:07.483
ASHLEY: There it is.

5449
03:32:07.483 --> 03:32:08.316
TALIESIN: Cure Wounds. There it is.

5450
03:32:08.316 --> 03:32:09.149
I'm just going to try and give

5451
03:32:09.149 --> 03:32:09.982
her a quick Cure Wounds, if I can.

5452
03:32:09.982 --> 03:32:11.714
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for heal.

5453
03:32:11.714 --> 03:32:13.314
Have you taken any damage, Jester?

5454
03:32:13.314 --> 03:32:14.147
LAURA: (sound of disagreement)

5455
03:32:14.147 --> 03:32:15.296
MATT: Okay, so you released the spell?

5456
03:32:15.296 --> 03:32:16.129
TALIESIN: Mm hm.

5457
03:32:16.129 --> 03:32:16.962
MATT: She's not asleep.

5458
03:32:16.962 --> 03:32:17.795
TALIESIN: Oh, fudge.

5459
03:32:17.795 --> 03:32:19.236
It was worth trying.

5460
03:32:19.236 --> 03:32:20.069
Goddamn it.

5461
03:32:20.069 --> 03:32:21.531
(sighs)

5462
03:32:21.531 --> 03:32:23.050
MARISHA: Fuck.

5463
03:32:23.050 --> 03:32:24.672
Fuck.

5464
03:32:24.672 --> 03:32:27.393
LAURA: Probably needs a Restoration or something.

5465
03:32:27.393 --> 03:32:29.059
MATT: Is that your turn, Caduceus?

5466
03:32:29.059 --> 03:32:30.708
TALIESIN: Yeah that's my, yeah I can't--

5467
03:32:30.708 --> 03:32:33.288
MATT: Fjord, you need to make a constitution saving throw.

5468
03:32:33.288 --> 03:32:36.788
TRAVIS: (groans)

5469
03:32:36.788 --> 03:32:39.713
MARISHA: It's not too hard, it's not (gasps).

5470
03:32:39.713 --> 03:32:40.984
MATT: Natural one.

5471
03:32:40.984 --> 03:32:41.844
LIAM: Yes.

5472
03:32:41.844 --> 03:32:42.677
MATT: Fjord.

5473
03:32:42.677 --> 03:32:45.857
You immediately fall on the ground,

5474
03:32:45.857 --> 03:32:48.102
everything going dark.

5475
03:32:48.102 --> 03:32:48.935
SAM: Dropping like flies.

5476
03:32:48.935 --> 03:32:49.809
LIAM: Here we go.

5477
03:32:49.809 --> 03:32:50.642
TRAVIS: Fuck!

5478
03:32:50.642 --> 03:32:51.771
LIAM: We are in the meat grinder right now.

5479
03:32:51.771 --> 03:32:53.738
MATT: That ends your turn.

5480
03:32:53.738 --> 03:32:55.073
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

5481
03:32:55.073 --> 03:32:56.632
TALIESIN: Mm hm.

5482
03:32:56.632 --> 03:32:57.465
MATT: Okay.

5483
03:32:57.465 --> 03:32:59.521
MARISHA: Fuck!
LIAM: Okay.

5484
03:32:59.521 --> 03:33:01.195
LAURA: It's because you called him Gary Busey.

5485
03:33:01.195 --> 03:33:03.637
(laughter)

5486
03:33:03.637 --> 03:33:04.859
MATT: That brings us to Nott.

5487
03:33:04.859 --> 03:33:07.299
Nott, would you make a constitution saving throw?

5488
03:33:07.299 --> 03:33:08.132
SAM: 20.

5489
03:33:08.132 --> 03:33:09.003
MATT: 20.
TRAVIS: Fuck that shit.

5490
03:33:09.003 --> 03:33:12.459
MATT: You watch as he falls to the ground unconscious,

5491
03:33:12.459 --> 03:33:14.337
Fjord just out, and the droning hits

5492
03:33:14.337 --> 03:33:15.719
your ears and you're like,

5493
03:33:15.719 --> 03:33:16.855
the panicking sets in.

5494
03:33:16.855 --> 03:33:18.177
Nah, nah. You're fine, you're fine.

5495
03:33:18.177 --> 03:33:19.010
You got this.

5496
03:33:19.010 --> 03:33:21.196
SAM: Is he no longer engaged with Fjord?

5497
03:33:21.196 --> 03:33:22.029
MATT: Correct.

5498
03:33:22.029 --> 03:33:22.862
SAM: Shit!

5499
03:33:22.862 --> 03:33:24.394
Shit balls!

5500
03:33:24.394 --> 03:33:25.229
MATT: Fjord is not a threat

5501
03:33:25.229 --> 03:33:26.062
to the creature.
SAM: You shit.

5502
03:33:26.062 --> 03:33:27.153
Fuck you, fuck shit.

5503
03:33:27.153 --> 03:33:30.953
(laughter)

5504
03:33:30.953 --> 03:33:32.942
MATT: I take so much joy provoking that from you.

5505
03:33:32.942 --> 03:33:35.927
(laughing)

5506
03:33:37.369 --> 03:33:40.212
SAM: Got to get that sneak attack.

5507
03:33:40.212 --> 03:33:42.955
I can't just attack. Got to get that sneak.

5508
03:33:42.955 --> 03:33:44.300
Or else it's not worth it.

5509
03:33:44.300 --> 03:33:45.741
TALIESIN: I was going to say that you,

5510
03:33:45.741 --> 03:33:46.988
you can, I mean...

5511
03:33:46.988 --> 03:33:49.713
SAM: All right, then I'll turn and shoot

5512
03:33:49.713 --> 03:33:51.020
the guy next to Caduceus.

5513
03:33:51.020 --> 03:33:52.594
MATT: Go for it. Roll for the attack.

5514
03:33:53.786 --> 03:33:54.627
SAM: 18.

5515
03:33:54.627 --> 03:33:55.681
MATT: 18 hits.

5516
03:33:55.681 --> 03:33:58.098
SAM: A million points of damage.

5517
03:33:59.951 --> 03:34:03.123
MARISHA: We cursed it. We cursed it by talking about it.

5518
03:34:05.189 --> 03:34:06.751
SAM: 29.

5519
03:34:06.751 --> 03:34:07.584
MATT: 29.

5520
03:34:07.584 --> 03:34:08.417
LIAM: Fuck.

5521
03:34:08.417 --> 03:34:09.450
MATT: (explosion)

5522
03:34:09.450 --> 03:34:10.608
SAM: 28.

5523
03:34:10.608 --> 03:34:12.257
MATT: You hit and it goes, (shrieking)

5524
03:34:12.257 --> 03:34:13.302
It gets thrown back from the burst

5525
03:34:13.302 --> 03:34:14.756
and the bolt throws it into the wall of fire

5526
03:34:14.756 --> 03:34:16.159
and you watch it incinerate

5527
03:34:16.159 --> 03:34:16.992
in the flames.

5528
03:34:16.992 --> 03:34:18.042
ASHLEY: Okay, those things are gone?

5529
03:34:18.042 --> 03:34:19.625
TALIESIN: Mm hm.
SAM: Yeah.

5530
03:34:19.625 --> 03:34:20.459
ASHLEY: Okay.

5531
03:34:22.004 --> 03:34:22.837
MATT: It's your action.

5532
03:34:22.837 --> 03:34:23.670
TRAVIS: Help us.

5533
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:24.503
(laughs)

5534
03:34:24.503 --> 03:34:25.396
TRAVIS: Help.

5535
03:34:25.396 --> 03:34:26.634
SAM: Bonus action disengage.

5536
03:34:26.634 --> 03:34:28.223
MATT: Okay. Where are you going?

5537
03:34:28.223 --> 03:34:29.372
SAM: Run the other way.

5538
03:34:29.372 --> 03:34:31.605
I'm going to actually step on Fjord's body

5539
03:34:31.605 --> 03:34:33.108
and over it and keep running.

5540
03:34:33.108 --> 03:34:34.774
MATT: Okay.
SAM: As far as I can.

5541
03:34:34.774 --> 03:34:36.922
LAURA: Oh no, don't.

5542
03:34:36.922 --> 03:34:39.136
SAM: Hopefully maybe my stepping on him will wake him up.

5543
03:34:39.136 --> 03:34:39.969
Wake up!

5544
03:34:39.969 --> 03:34:40.802
MATT: 35.

5545
03:34:40.802 --> 03:34:41.903
There you go.

5546
03:34:41.903 --> 03:34:43.078
And you stop at the edge

5547
03:34:43.078 --> 03:34:45.136
of this pit, which with your dark vision

5548
03:34:45.136 --> 03:34:46.820
looking down you can see about 15 feet down

5549
03:34:46.820 --> 03:34:49.679
in the pit, it's just bones.

5550
03:34:49.679 --> 03:34:53.226
Just bones and bones of all creature types.

5551
03:34:53.226 --> 03:34:56.324
All animals and all sorts of things.

5552
03:34:56.324 --> 03:34:57.801
You can't even at a glance make out

5553
03:34:57.801 --> 03:35:02.272
but it a lot of bones. Some of them look very old.

5554
03:35:02.272 --> 03:35:03.186
The smell hits you.

5555
03:35:03.186 --> 03:35:04.327
SAM: Okay.

5556
03:35:04.327 --> 03:35:05.160
The bone pit.

5557
03:35:05.160 --> 03:35:06.451
They talked about that.

5558
03:35:06.451 --> 03:35:07.834
The smell of the bone pit.
MARISHA: The smell.

5559
03:35:07.834 --> 03:35:08.900
SAM: Yeah.

5560
03:35:08.900 --> 03:35:09.841
MATT: Does that finish your turn?

5561
03:35:09.841 --> 03:35:10.674
SAM: That's it.

5562
03:35:10.674 --> 03:35:11.941
MATT: All right, Yasha, you're up.

5563
03:35:11.941 --> 03:35:13.182
ASHLEY: Okay.

5564
03:35:13.182 --> 03:35:14.245
TALIESIN: Con save, or...?

5565
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:17.407
MATT: You're just out of the range.

5566
03:35:17.407 --> 03:35:19.990
TALIESIN: No, I mean from the previous--

5567
03:35:20.949 --> 03:35:22.949
ASHLEY: The strength--

5568
03:35:22.949 --> 03:35:24.368
or is that gone because they're dead?

5569
03:35:24.368 --> 03:35:25.320
MATT: That happens at the end of your turn.

5570
03:35:25.320 --> 03:35:27.097
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.
ASHLEY: Happens at the end.

5571
03:35:27.097 --> 03:35:28.105
Is it gone because they're dead?

5572
03:35:28.105 --> 03:35:29.213
MATT: Nope, the effect's still on you.

5573
03:35:29.213 --> 03:35:30.046
ASHLEY: Okay.

5574
03:35:30.046 --> 03:35:30.879
Well--

5575
03:35:30.879 --> 03:35:31.712
MARISHA: (nervously) Okay.

5576
03:35:31.712 --> 03:35:33.269
ASHLEY: I can't do anything with Jester.

5577
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:34.847
I can try to drag her out of there.

5578
03:35:36.147 --> 03:35:36.988
Okay.

5579
03:35:36.988 --> 03:35:41.365
I'm going to start going to Gary Busey because...

5580
03:35:41.365 --> 03:35:43.948
(laughter)

5581
03:35:45.727 --> 03:35:46.943
MATT: There you go.

5582
03:35:46.943 --> 03:35:48.362
You rush up towards it (grunts),

5583
03:35:48.362 --> 03:35:50.879
dragging the weapon, go for your strikes.

5584
03:35:50.879 --> 03:35:52.122
TRAVIS: With a part gasp.

5585
03:35:52.122 --> 03:35:53.158
Get it!

5586
03:35:53.158 --> 03:35:55.152
(breathless gasp) Yes! Yes!

5587
03:35:55.152 --> 03:35:57.679
(dramatic music)

5588
03:35:57.679 --> 03:35:59.055
MARISHA: Oh no.

5589
03:36:00.163 --> 03:36:01.277
ASHLEY: I rolled a one.

5590
03:36:01.277 --> 03:36:02.317
TRAVIS: Oh!

5591
03:36:02.317 --> 03:36:03.150
SAM: Misfire.

5592
03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:04.551
Your sword exploded up.

5593
03:36:04.551 --> 03:36:06.639
MATT: (grunt) You go to swing and the creature

5594
03:36:06.639 --> 03:36:08.394
dodges out of the way and your blade

5595
03:36:08.394 --> 03:36:10.394
strikes the side of the basin.

5596
03:36:10.394 --> 03:36:11.227
(shattering)

5597
03:36:11.227 --> 03:36:12.936
The scraping sound causes your ears

5598
03:36:12.936 --> 03:36:14.534
just to swell up ever so slightly

5599
03:36:14.534 --> 03:36:16.975
and you see the spark and the blade hitting the stone.

5600
03:36:16.975 --> 03:36:19.090
The water's now disturbed and rocking.

5601
03:36:19.090 --> 03:36:20.332
Make your second attack.

5602
03:36:20.332 --> 03:36:21.898
LAURA: What if our Kickstarter ends

5603
03:36:21.898 --> 03:36:23.757
and we TPK in the same day?

5604
03:36:23.757 --> 03:36:24.978
TRAVIS: That would be amazing.

5605
03:36:24.978 --> 03:36:26.178
ASHLEY: Oh, that's great.

5606
03:36:26.178 --> 03:36:27.286
Okay, um.

5607
03:36:29.010 --> 03:36:30.050
SAM: This is bad.

5608
03:36:30.050 --> 03:36:31.716
(laughter)

5609
03:36:31.716 --> 03:36:32.549
TALIESIN: Any thoughts on how to wake

5610
03:36:32.549 --> 03:36:33.908
these motherfuckers up?

5611
03:36:34.825 --> 03:36:35.658
ASHLEY: 26.

5612
03:36:35.658 --> 03:36:36.587
MATT: 26?

5613
03:36:36.587 --> 03:36:37.728
ASHLEY: Yeah, roll again.

5614
03:36:37.728 --> 03:36:38.827
TALIESIN: No, there's got to be a--

5615
03:36:38.827 --> 03:36:40.091
ASHLEY: I thought it was higher.

5616
03:36:40.091 --> 03:36:42.600
Yeah. 26. It's the same.

5617
03:36:42.600 --> 03:36:45.280
MATT: 26 okay. That hits. Roll damage.

5618
03:36:45.280 --> 03:36:46.113
TALIESIN: Two down.

5619
03:36:46.113 --> 03:36:47.263
SAM: That's not bad.

5620
03:36:49.204 --> 03:36:51.603
It's the Mighty Nein, so we've got seven lives, right?

5621
03:36:51.603 --> 03:36:53.031
ASHLEY: That's only 2d6, right?

5622
03:36:53.031 --> 03:36:55.059
Because the divine was for the...

5623
03:36:55.059 --> 03:36:56.325
TRAVIS: It's the first one that hits.

5624
03:36:56.325 --> 03:36:57.158
MATT: Correct.

5625
03:36:57.158 --> 03:36:58.357
Well no, no, no. It's the first one that hits.

5626
03:36:58.357 --> 03:36:59.865
So if the first one misses the second

5627
03:36:59.865 --> 03:37:00.882
one get the additional d6.

5628
03:37:00.882 --> 03:37:02.132
ASHLEY: Got it.

5629
03:37:02.132 --> 03:37:02.965
Great.

5630
03:37:02.965 --> 03:37:03.798
Okay so--

5631
03:37:03.798 --> 03:37:04.880
MATT: Like sneak attack.

5632
03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:06.380
You can do it once per round as the first on that hits.

5633
03:37:06.380 --> 03:37:09.937
(dramatic music)

5634
03:37:09.937 --> 03:37:11.057
ASHLEY: 21.

5635
03:37:11.057 --> 03:37:12.215
MATT: Nice.

5636
03:37:13.724 --> 03:37:15.297
The first one hits and the second time

5637
03:37:15.297 --> 03:37:18.321
you swing upward and it takes the impact.

5638
03:37:18.321 --> 03:37:19.697
Underneath its proboscis,

5639
03:37:19.697 --> 03:37:22.599
there's this tiny little jaw that opens up,

5640
03:37:22.599 --> 03:37:25.639
slobber pours out and elements of what was Fjord's blood

5641
03:37:25.639 --> 03:37:28.180
spill out and spatter into the basin in the ground

5642
03:37:28.180 --> 03:37:29.452
right next to you.

5643
03:37:29.452 --> 03:37:31.468
ASHLEY: Sheesh. Okay.

5644
03:37:33.478 --> 03:37:34.478
MATT: That ends your turn?

5645
03:37:34.478 --> 03:37:37.988
ASHLEY: No. Is anyone within ten feet of me?

5646
03:37:37.988 --> 03:37:39.655
TALIESIN: Just, uh... no.

5647
03:37:40.540 --> 03:37:41.993
MATT: Nope.

5648
03:37:41.993 --> 03:37:42.826
ASHLEY: Okay.

5649
03:37:42.826 --> 03:37:43.659
TALIESIN: Not conscious.

5650
03:37:43.659 --> 03:37:44.576
ASHLEY: I will...

5651
03:37:48.731 --> 03:37:50.444
Let me see if this works.

5652
03:37:50.444 --> 03:37:52.085
I'm going to poof up my--

5653
03:37:52.085 --> 03:37:53.591
MATT: Is that an action or a bonus action?

5654
03:37:53.591 --> 03:37:58.231
ASHLEY: It is a--I'm--ugh, hold on.

5655
03:37:58.231 --> 03:38:00.944
(reading quickly)

5656
03:38:00.944 --> 03:38:01.788
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind it's not.

5657
03:38:01.788 --> 03:38:02.737
Nevermind.

5658
03:38:02.737 --> 03:38:03.629
MATT: Okay.

5659
03:38:03.629 --> 03:38:05.386
ASHLEY: It's an action.

5660
03:38:05.386 --> 03:38:06.219
I saw bonus action, but I could end

5661
03:38:06.219 --> 03:38:08.359
it as a bonus action. So apologies.

5662
03:38:08.359 --> 03:38:09.250
MATT: It's all good.

5663
03:38:09.250 --> 03:38:10.092
ASHLEY: I'm still raging.

5664
03:38:10.092 --> 03:38:11.025
MATT: Yep, still raging.

5665
03:38:11.025 --> 03:38:14.566
ASHLEY: Okay, so then that's it.

5666
03:38:14.566 --> 03:38:15.399
That'll do.

5667
03:38:15.399 --> 03:38:16.237
MATT: That's your turn.

5668
03:38:16.237 --> 03:38:17.070
ASHLEY: That'll do, pig.

5669
03:38:17.070 --> 03:38:19.244
Do I need to roll for anything?

5670
03:38:19.244 --> 03:38:20.077
MATT: Nope.

5671
03:38:20.077 --> 03:38:21.244
ASHLEY: Constitutions to be done with these things?

5672
03:38:21.244 --> 03:38:23.494
MATT: Nope, only at the top of your turn.

5673
03:38:23.494 --> 03:38:26.684
The chasme's turn now.

5674
03:38:26.684 --> 03:38:28.044
As you strike it.

5675
03:38:28.044 --> 03:38:30.647
You strike it and it goes (whooshing)

5676
03:38:30.647 --> 03:38:33.905
looking towards you but its already had a taste.

5677
03:38:33.905 --> 03:38:36.169
(yelling)

5678
03:38:36.169 --> 03:38:37.100
TRAVIS: I'm anemic!

5679
03:38:37.100 --> 03:38:38.577
LAURA: Matthew Mercer!

5680
03:38:38.577 --> 03:38:39.959
ASHLEY: Do I get an attack of opportunity

5681
03:38:39.959 --> 03:38:41.495
since it turned away from me?

5682
03:38:41.495 --> 03:38:43.415
MATT: It does because of your Sentinel.

5683
03:38:43.415 --> 03:38:44.634
Because it's attacking somebody else

5684
03:38:44.634 --> 03:38:46.817
in this space, I believe.

5685
03:38:46.817 --> 03:38:48.859
With advantage, that's going to be--

5686
03:38:48.859 --> 03:38:50.026
I rolled a four and 19.

5687
03:38:50.999 --> 03:38:53.436
So it's a 24 to hit.

5688
03:38:53.436 --> 03:38:54.417
TRAVIS: On who?

5689
03:38:54.417 --> 03:38:55.250
MATT: On you.

5690
03:38:55.250 --> 03:38:56.433
TRAVIS: Aren't I unconscious?

5691
03:38:56.433 --> 03:38:58.099
MATT: Yes.

5692
03:38:58.099 --> 03:39:02.226
TRAVIS: Natural--isn't that two failed saving throws?

5693
03:39:02.226 --> 03:39:03.209
SAM: You're unconscious--

5694
03:39:03.209 --> 03:39:04.254
TALIESIN: But you're not dead.

5695
03:39:04.254 --> 03:39:05.956
MATT: You're unconscious; you're not at zero hit points.

5696
03:39:05.956 --> 03:39:06.789
ASHLEY: You're sleepies.

5697
03:39:06.789 --> 03:39:08.105
TRAVIS: Sorry. Okay.

5698
03:39:08.105 --> 03:39:09.479
MATT: But it is an auto-crit.

5699
03:39:09.479 --> 03:39:10.312
TRAVIS: Okay.

5700
03:39:10.312 --> 03:39:12.153
TALIESIN: Can I dispel that auto-crit from where I am?

5701
03:39:12.153 --> 03:39:12.986
MATT: Are you in the range of it?

5702
03:39:12.986 --> 03:39:14.603
TALIESIN: I'm within 30 feet of him.

5703
03:39:14.603 --> 03:39:15.444
MATT: Yes, you can.

5704
03:39:15.444 --> 03:39:17.202
TALIESIN: Then I can dispel that auto-crit.

5705
03:39:17.202 --> 03:39:18.280
MATT: Yeah, you can!

5706
03:39:18.280 --> 03:39:19.433
You're just within 30 feet.

5707
03:39:19.433 --> 03:39:21.464
Okay.

5708
03:39:21.464 --> 03:39:23.347
TRAVIS: The second one hits. Oh.

5709
03:39:23.347 --> 03:39:24.346
MATT: Yeah, the second, yeah.

5710
03:39:24.346 --> 03:39:25.846
MARISHA: Wait. Is he depleting hit points

5711
03:39:25.846 --> 03:39:28.015
or is he rolling for death saves now?

5712
03:39:28.015 --> 03:39:29.306
MATT: No death saves.

5713
03:39:29.306 --> 03:39:31.347
He's unconscious so it's a critical hit

5714
03:39:31.347 --> 03:39:32.299
against an unconscious creature.

5715
03:39:32.299 --> 03:39:34.092
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

5716
03:39:34.092 --> 03:39:35.558
ASHLEY: I get to roll an attack on him?

5717
03:39:35.558 --> 03:39:36.948
MATT: Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit

5718
03:39:36.948 --> 03:39:39.141
if the attacker within five feet of the creature.

5719
03:39:39.141 --> 03:39:39.974
ASHLEY: I get to an attack on him?

5720
03:39:39.974 --> 03:39:42.819
MATT: You do, but let me roll the damage on Travis first.

5721
03:39:42.819 --> 03:39:44.408
So it's not a critical hit because Caduceus

5722
03:39:44.408 --> 03:39:46.766
just saved your fucking ass.

5723
03:39:46.766 --> 03:39:49.116
You take--

5724
03:39:49.116 --> 03:39:50.308
MARISHA: Caddy MVP!

5725
03:39:50.308 --> 03:39:51.540
TRAVIS: I love that grave cleric.

5726
03:39:51.540 --> 03:39:53.340
MATT: 12 points of piercing damage

5727
03:39:53.340 --> 03:39:54.548
as it pierces into your chest.

5728
03:39:54.548 --> 03:39:55.707
TALIESIN: That would be 24.

5729
03:39:55.707 --> 03:39:56.574
SAM: Here's the big roll.

5730
03:39:56.574 --> 03:39:58.056
MATT: Yeah, that would have been 24.

5731
03:39:58.056 --> 03:40:00.149
Then necrotic would've been doubled, too.

5732
03:40:00.149 --> 03:40:01.557
LAURA: Oh my god.

5733
03:40:01.557 --> 03:40:03.922
(dice rattling)

5734
03:40:03.922 --> 03:40:05.300
MARISHA: That's a lot of dice.

5735
03:40:05.300 --> 03:40:06.253
TALIESIN: Yep.

5736
03:40:07.428 --> 03:40:08.948
TRAVIS: That's not doing what I wanted.

5737
03:40:08.948 --> 03:40:10.460
LAURA: Did you guys see that thing where somebody--

5738
03:40:10.460 --> 03:40:12.068
MATT: 22 points of necrotic damage.

5739
03:40:12.068 --> 03:40:13.075
LAURA: --videoed all of our dice roll styles?

5740
03:40:13.075 --> 03:40:13.908
TRAVIS: Okay.

5741
03:40:13.908 --> 03:40:16.142
MATT: Your maximum hit points is reduced by another 22.

5742
03:40:16.142 --> 03:40:18.084
MARISHA: Sam's the Vegas casino--

5743
03:40:18.084 --> 03:40:19.750
TRAVIS: Holy shit. Okay.

5744
03:40:19.750 --> 03:40:21.469
MATT: Mark that.

5745
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:23.364
That would've been another 44

5746
03:40:23.364 --> 03:40:26.082
if he hadn't have stopped that.

5747
03:40:26.082 --> 03:40:28.714
SAM: Oh, are you alive?

5748
03:40:28.714 --> 03:40:29.876
TRAVIS: Barely.

5749
03:40:29.876 --> 03:40:31.940
LAURA: Are the points lowered by that much, then, too?

5750
03:40:31.940 --> 03:40:34.265
MATT: Yes. Reduced by another 22.

5751
03:40:35.205 --> 03:40:36.038
I'm just putting it out there,

5752
03:40:36.038 --> 03:40:37.745
you reducing that critical hit,

5753
03:40:37.745 --> 03:40:39.040
probably saved his life because

5754
03:40:39.040 --> 03:40:40.746
if that attack reduces him to maximum hit points, they die.

5755
03:40:40.746 --> 03:40:41.579
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

5756
03:40:42.687 --> 03:40:44.112
We got to get him off that right away.

5757
03:40:44.112 --> 03:40:45.545
MATT: There would've been no death saves.

5758
03:40:45.545 --> 03:40:46.838
LIAM: You hear that?

5759
03:40:46.838 --> 03:40:48.113
SAM: You just almost died!

5760
03:40:48.113 --> 03:40:49.509
LIAM: You almost died. No death saves.

5761
03:40:49.509 --> 03:40:51.723
Fuck you. Fjord gone.

5762
03:40:51.723 --> 03:40:53.117
MATT: Caduceus is your best friend, buddy--

5763
03:40:53.117 --> 03:40:53.950
MARISHA: What do you mean, what do you mean?

5764
03:40:53.950 --> 03:40:55.251
Why, why, why?

5765
03:40:55.251 --> 03:40:56.690
MATT: He canceled the critical hit.

5766
03:40:56.690 --> 03:40:58.048
SAM: Because the hit point maximum--

5767
03:40:58.048 --> 03:40:58.881
LAURA: It's like Finger of Death.

5768
03:40:58.881 --> 03:41:00.158
SAM: --would've gone gone to zero.

5769
03:41:00.158 --> 03:41:01.141
TALIESIN: Mm hm.

5770
03:41:02.158 --> 03:41:04.497
LIAM: With the nature of what it--this thing---

5771
03:41:04.497 --> 03:41:05.330
MATT: So--

5772
03:41:05.330 --> 03:41:06.629
LIAM: Cool, cool, cool.

5773
03:41:06.629 --> 03:41:07.604
MATT: Go ahead and

5774
03:41:07.604 --> 03:41:09.595
roll your damage, Yasha. Make your save, by the way--

5775
03:41:09.595 --> 03:41:11.701
TALIESIN: It's not her turn yet.

5776
03:41:11.701 --> 03:41:12.534
It's still--

5777
03:41:12.534 --> 03:41:13.519
MATT: I know, but I mean for the previous--

5778
03:41:13.519 --> 03:41:14.352
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

5779
03:41:14.352 --> 03:41:15.268
ASHLEY: Fuck you!

5780
03:41:15.268 --> 03:41:17.985
No. I rolled a ten.

5781
03:41:17.985 --> 03:41:20.123
(worried chatter)

5782
03:41:20.123 --> 03:41:21.798
MATT: Yeah, so you're still doing half damage.

5783
03:41:24.896 --> 03:41:26.758
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5784
03:41:26.758 --> 03:41:28.485
16, does 16 hit?

5785
03:41:28.485 --> 03:41:29.765
MATT: 16 does hit.

5786
03:41:29.765 --> 03:41:31.431
ASHLEY: Okay. You can roll damage on

5787
03:41:31.431 --> 03:41:34.969
this extra reaction attack as it went after Fjord.

5788
03:41:34.969 --> 03:41:35.802
ASHLEY: (counting)

5789
03:41:35.802 --> 03:41:38.535
(dramatic music)

5790
03:41:38.535 --> 03:41:40.274
ASHLEY: 16 points of damage.

5791
03:41:40.274 --> 03:41:41.538
MATT: 16 points of damage.

5792
03:41:41.538 --> 03:41:43.130
Half that so takes eight.

5793
03:41:43.130 --> 03:41:44.321
ASHLEY: (frustrated growl)

5794
03:41:44.321 --> 03:41:46.898
MATT: Because that effect from the Weakening Gaze.

5795
03:41:46.898 --> 03:41:47.837
All right.

5796
03:41:47.837 --> 03:41:49.959
SAM: He was so good in the Buddy Holly story.

5797
03:41:49.959 --> 03:41:53.239
(laughter)

5798
03:41:53.239 --> 03:41:55.917
MATT: Now, the Landspeaker peeks up from behind

5799
03:41:55.917 --> 03:42:00.390
and grabs another stone and chucks it at the creature

5800
03:42:00.390 --> 03:42:01.671
shouting a curse in Giant.

5801
03:42:01.671 --> 03:42:03.533
"(speaks in Giant)"

5802
03:42:03.533 --> 03:42:05.704
Which you know says, "Shitface, die."

5803
03:42:05.704 --> 03:42:06.537
TALIESIN: Mm.

5804
03:42:06.537 --> 03:42:07.868
ASHLEY: Yeah, fair.

5805
03:42:07.868 --> 03:42:09.287
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

5806
03:42:09.287 --> 03:42:11.825
MATT: That's going to be--ooh, a 15

5807
03:42:11.825 --> 03:42:12.946
just barely hits.

5808
03:42:12.946 --> 03:42:15.654
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

5809
03:42:15.654 --> 03:42:18.004
Information is good.

5810
03:42:18.004 --> 03:42:18.845
15.

5811
03:42:18.845 --> 03:42:20.525
MATT: That'll be 4d10.

5812
03:42:22.450 --> 03:42:23.950
TRAVIS: Come on, 4d10. All tens!

5813
03:42:26.725 --> 03:42:27.605
MATT: Eight, nine, nine, nine.

5814
03:42:27.605 --> 03:42:28.438
I'm not even joking.

5815
03:42:28.438 --> 03:42:29.271
SAM: Whoa!

5816
03:42:29.271 --> 03:42:32.292
MATT: You are charming your NPC allies attacks.

5817
03:42:32.292 --> 03:42:33.986
TRAVIS: Giant damage!

5818
03:42:33.986 --> 03:42:36.027
MATT: (laughs)

5819
03:42:36.027 --> 03:42:37.027
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

5820
03:42:38.370 --> 03:42:39.370
MARISHA: Holy shit.

5821
03:42:42.739 --> 03:42:45.847
TRAVIS: I'm so afraid of being beaten to a pulp.

5822
03:42:45.847 --> 03:42:48.189
MATT: 31 points of bludgeoning damage.

5823
03:42:48.189 --> 03:42:49.022
TRAVIS: Say it.

5824
03:42:50.064 --> 03:42:51.346
MATT: How do you want to do this?

5825
03:42:51.346 --> 03:42:53.200
(screaming)

5826
03:42:53.200 --> 03:42:54.861
MATT: Landspeaker Soorna.

5827
03:42:54.861 --> 03:42:55.694
SAM: The NPC.

5828
03:42:55.694 --> 03:42:57.879
MATT: The NPC got the How Do You Want To Do This?

5829
03:42:57.879 --> 03:43:02.098
TRAVIS: Thank god we aligned ourselves with some giants.

5830
03:43:02.098 --> 03:43:03.138
MARISHA: (groans in relief)

5831
03:43:03.138 --> 03:43:05.159
TALIESIN: Really I'm taking credit for this one.

5832
03:43:05.159 --> 03:43:05.992
LAURA: Yeah.

5833
03:43:07.042 --> 03:43:09.585
SAM: You can describe it for the giant.

5834
03:43:09.585 --> 03:43:10.418
MARISHA: Yeah.

5835
03:43:10.418 --> 03:43:12.034
MATT: Wow, that's really funny.

5836
03:43:12.034 --> 03:43:13.698
As Landspeaker pulls around

5837
03:43:13.698 --> 03:43:15.634
and curses and chucks the rock,

5838
03:43:15.634 --> 03:43:18.760
you see now the bleeding proboscis

5839
03:43:18.760 --> 03:43:20.940
of the chasme dripping off gore

5840
03:43:20.940 --> 03:43:24.751
after piercing a second time Fjord's chest.

5841
03:43:24.751 --> 03:43:26.789
You can see both wounds now opening, gaping.

5842
03:43:26.789 --> 03:43:31.141
The creature spins around (buzzing) towards Yasha.

5843
03:43:31.141 --> 03:43:34.430
It's tiny little crusty arms clawed

5844
03:43:34.430 --> 03:43:36.034
and reaching out towards you

5845
03:43:36.034 --> 03:43:39.008
and suddenly it (buzzing, smack),

5846
03:43:39.008 --> 03:43:41.735
and full on splats against the side of the wall.

5847
03:43:41.735 --> 03:43:45.777
The rock rolls off of it, hits the ground, and the creature,

5848
03:43:45.777 --> 03:43:47.559
is this giant mess.

5849
03:43:47.559 --> 03:43:48.392
TRAVIS: Yes.

5850
03:43:48.392 --> 03:43:50.067
MATT: Across the stone side.

5851
03:43:50.067 --> 03:43:50.900
SAM: Ray!

5852
03:43:50.900 --> 03:43:55.458
MATT: Peels off and falls into the water basin.

5853
03:43:56.855 --> 03:43:58.557
It's now floating in the water.

5854
03:43:58.557 --> 03:44:01.321
You see the waters turning this dark brackish

5855
03:44:01.321 --> 03:44:04.662
black-brown color as it's unmoving and dead.

5856
03:44:05.562 --> 03:44:07.021
ASHLEY: ♪ Fuck the chasme. ♪

5857

(laughter)
(applause)

5858
03:44:15.950 --> 03:44:17.399
TALIESIN: Yeah, is there anything coming

5859
03:44:17.399 --> 03:44:18.614
up from that hallway or I'm--

5860
03:44:18.614 --> 03:44:19.447
MATT: Make a perception check.

5861
03:44:19.447 --> 03:44:21.015
TALIESIN: I'm making a perception check right now.

5862
03:44:21.015 --> 03:44:23.053
SAM: The bone ally or whatever.

5863
03:44:23.053 --> 03:44:23.886
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

5864
03:44:23.886 --> 03:44:24.754
ASHLEY: Fuck yeah.

5865
03:44:24.754 --> 03:44:25.587
MATT: Okay.

5866
03:44:25.587 --> 03:44:26.420
SAM: Natural one.

5867
03:44:26.420 --> 03:44:28.551
(laughter)

5868
03:44:28.551 --> 03:44:30.609
MATT: You glance down the hallway...

5869
03:44:30.609 --> 03:44:31.442
TALIESIN: Mm hm.

5870
03:44:34.084 --> 03:44:34.925
ASHLEY: Uh oh.

5871
03:44:34.925 --> 03:44:36.050
TALIESIN: Yep.

5872
03:44:36.050 --> 03:44:37.158
MATT: Move this back a bit if you don't mind.

5873
03:44:37.158 --> 03:44:38.499
TALIESIN: We ain't done yet.

5874
03:44:38.499 --> 03:44:39.332
SAM: Wait, what, what?

5875
03:44:39.332 --> 03:44:40.288
LAURA: Somebody wake us up, please.

5876
03:44:40.288 --> 03:44:41.456
SAM: There's more map?

5877
03:44:41.456 --> 03:44:42.289
MATT: There is.

5878
03:44:42.289 --> 03:44:43.400
LIAM: That's super cool.

5879
03:44:43.400 --> 03:44:48.400
SAM: This combat is still brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

5880
03:44:48.968 --> 03:44:50.212
TALIESIN: How the fuck am I going to wake you up?

5881
03:44:50.212 --> 03:44:51.295
We've got to also--

5882
03:44:51.295 --> 03:44:52.517
TRAVIS: We got it, we got it.

5883
03:44:52.517 --> 03:44:53.350
SAM: No!

5884
03:44:53.350 --> 03:44:56.134
They have to know that this combat is sponsored

5885
03:44:56.134 --> 03:44:58.543
by Dwarven Forge! Oh, okay.

5886
03:44:59.845 --> 03:45:00.747
TRAVIS: Oh god.

5887
03:45:00.747 --> 03:45:02.681
Do we need more space?

5888
03:45:02.681 --> 03:45:04.091
MATT: We may.

5889
03:45:04.091 --> 03:45:05.467
SAM: What the fuck, Matt?

5890
03:45:05.467 --> 03:45:06.384
LIAM: More!

5891
03:45:06.384 --> 03:45:07.707
MATT: Move that back just a little bit.

5892
03:45:07.707 --> 03:45:09.142
LIAM: Can we touch the camera?

5893
03:45:09.142 --> 03:45:10.091
MARISHA: Steve?

5894
03:45:10.091 --> 03:45:10.924
Steve?

5895
03:45:10.924 --> 03:45:12.229
SAM: Steve's right next to you.

5896
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:14.859
He's literally three feet away from you.

5897
03:45:14.859 --> 03:45:16.642
He's literally behind you.

5898
03:45:16.642 --> 03:45:18.123
MARISHA: I need an adult!

5899
03:45:18.123 --> 03:45:19.627
LIAM: We did it! We did it!

5900
03:45:20.477 --> 03:45:22.629
TALIESIN: I don't like this at all.

5901
03:45:22.629 --> 03:45:24.654
MATT: Looking down the hallway there, Caduceus--

5902
03:45:24.654 --> 03:45:25.812
SAM: I'm sorry, Liam.

5903
03:45:26.832 --> 03:45:31.832
MATT: You see a few portions of the stone-carved walls

5904
03:45:32.140 --> 03:45:34.215
begin to get a little more rough.

5905
03:45:34.215 --> 03:45:37.907
You see a rather

5906
03:45:37.907 --> 03:45:41.473
narrow entrance to a chamber across the way

5907
03:45:41.473 --> 03:45:44.817
and the path goes into two different directions.

5908
03:45:44.817 --> 03:45:46.099
TALIESIN: Nothing's coming down yet?

5909
03:45:46.099 --> 03:45:47.280
MATT: Nothing is coming down.

5910
03:45:47.280 --> 03:45:48.341
TALIESIN: I don't hear anything.

5911
03:45:48.341 --> 03:45:49.664
Has the buzzing stopped?

5912
03:45:49.664 --> 03:45:50.603
MATT: The buzzing has stopped.

5913
03:45:50.603 --> 03:45:53.440
TALIESIN: We are--I am immediately grabbing Jester,

5914
03:45:53.440 --> 03:45:55.117
moving her to the side and trying

5915
03:45:55.117 --> 03:45:56.819
to wake her up as I pull her aside

5916
03:45:56.819 --> 03:45:57.652
and--

5917
03:45:57.652 --> 03:45:58.885
MATT: (whacking)

5918
03:45:58.885 --> 03:45:59.877
TALIESIN: She's out.

5919
03:45:59.877 --> 03:46:00.757
I'm moving.

5920
03:46:00.757 --> 03:46:01.873
Watch her.

5921
03:46:01.873 --> 03:46:03.216
I'm running over to Fjord and I'm going to

5922
03:46:03.216 --> 03:46:06.096
blast some healing into him.

5923
03:46:06.096 --> 03:46:07.729
MATT: Okay.

5924
03:46:07.729 --> 03:46:09.386
Fjord, you are conscious by the way.

5925
03:46:09.386 --> 03:46:10.219
TRAVIS: I'm awake?

5926
03:46:10.219 --> 03:46:11.419
MATT: You wake up (gasping).

5927
03:46:11.419 --> 03:46:13.419
The pain is what knocked you out of it.

5928
03:46:13.419 --> 03:46:16.219
The piercing of the proboscis

5929
03:46:16.219 --> 03:46:17.499
managed to bring you to consciousness

5930
03:46:17.499 --> 03:46:19.100
and you're like (grunts).

5931
03:46:19.100 --> 03:46:20.563
TRAVIS: Oh my fucking chest.

5932
03:46:20.563 --> 03:46:21.819
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5933
03:46:21.819 --> 03:46:22.955
Seeing that I run

5934
03:46:22.955 --> 03:46:26.155
over to Jester and I go boof!

5935
03:46:26.155 --> 03:46:27.515
MATT: All right, roll damage.
MARISHA: I punch her.

5936
03:46:27.515 --> 03:46:28.896
MATT: (laughs)

5937
03:46:28.896 --> 03:46:29.729
MARISHA: Sorry, Jesty.

5938
03:46:29.729 --> 03:46:30.822
MATT: With the holy weapon hand.

5939
03:46:30.822 --> 03:46:32.053
SAM: Oh no!

5940
03:46:32.053 --> 03:46:33.469
MARISHA: Wait, just straight damage?

5941
03:46:33.469 --> 03:46:35.035
MATT: Yeah.

5942
03:46:35.035 --> 03:46:36.037
If you're afraid--

5943
03:46:36.037 --> 03:46:37.177
TALIESIN: Did you hit with her like the glowing fist

5944
03:46:37.177 --> 03:46:38.059
or like your stick or something.

5945
03:46:38.059 --> 03:46:39.701
MARISHA: Can I just give her a love tap?

5946
03:46:39.701 --> 03:46:40.757
MATT: I'll let you do it, yeah.

5947
03:46:40.757 --> 03:46:42.423
MARISHA: Okay, 11.

5948
03:46:42.423 --> 03:46:43.256
11 damage.

5949
03:46:43.256 --> 03:46:45.148
MATT: I'll say you can pull your punch a bit.

5950
03:46:45.148 --> 03:46:47.224
You're not going to just, "Sorry, Jester."

5951
03:46:47.224 --> 03:46:48.057
Whack!

5952
03:46:49.725 --> 03:46:51.522
MARISHA: She's a little--we'll wake her up.

5953
03:46:51.522 --> 03:46:52.540
MATT: Let's say elbow.

5954
03:46:52.540 --> 03:46:53.381
You elbow her a bit.

5955
03:46:53.381 --> 03:46:54.420
MARISHA: I'll elbow her

5956
03:46:54.420 --> 03:46:55.253
across the jaw.

5957
03:46:55.253 --> 03:46:56.086
MATT: You take a point of damage.

5958
03:46:56.086 --> 03:46:57.025
TRAVIS: Across the jaw.

5959
03:46:57.025 --> 03:46:58.675
MARISHA: She's fine.

5960
03:46:58.675 --> 03:47:01.168
TRAVIS: Not in the arm or in the hip.

5961
03:47:01.168 --> 03:47:03.765
LIAM: Not how it went with Kynan.

5962
03:47:03.765 --> 03:47:05.707
Not how it went with Kynan.

5963
03:47:05.707 --> 03:47:07.040
MATT: Nope.

5964
03:47:07.040 --> 03:47:07.902
TALIESIN: So...

5965
03:47:09.316 --> 03:47:10.149
LAURA: Am I awake?

5966
03:47:10.149 --> 03:47:11.565
LIAM: Blood out the eyes.

5967
03:47:11.565 --> 03:47:12.715
MATT: Yeah, well you were going for

5968
03:47:12.715 --> 03:47:14.031
unconsciousness on that one.

5969
03:47:14.031 --> 03:47:14.869
LIAM: That is absolutely true.

5970
03:47:14.869 --> 03:47:15.702
MATT: There's a difference between waking

5971
03:47:15.702 --> 03:47:17.269
you up and going, "I want this guy out in one hit."

5972
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:19.051
LIAM: You're 100% correct.

5973
03:47:19.051 --> 03:47:21.466
MATT: You come to consciousness after Beau cracks

5974
03:47:21.466 --> 03:47:23.968
you in the face with the shoulder, with an elbow.

5975
03:47:23.968 --> 03:47:25.733
MARISHA: I might've broken a molar. I'm real sorry.

5976
03:47:25.733 --> 03:47:27.032
SAM: Beau is corrupted.

5977
03:47:27.032 --> 03:47:27.865
Kill her!

5978
03:47:27.865 --> 03:47:29.448
LAURA: No!

5979
03:47:29.448 --> 03:47:30.788
Did that really happen?

5980
03:47:30.788 --> 03:47:31.969
Are you corrupted?

5981
03:47:31.969 --> 03:47:33.130
TALIESIN: How bad are you?

5982
03:47:33.130 --> 03:47:35.455
LAURA: What happened? I had a nightmare about a mosquito.

5983
03:47:35.455 --> 03:47:36.946
TRAVIS: (expressive groaning)

5984
03:47:36.946 --> 03:47:38.380
SAM: Fjord looks bad.

5985
03:47:38.380 --> 03:47:41.696
He's bleeding from the ears and eyes.

5986
03:47:41.696 --> 03:47:43.308
ASHLEY: What's eight?

5987
03:47:43.308 --> 03:47:45.838
TALIESIN: Let's very quietly pull into the corner

5988
03:47:45.838 --> 03:47:49.150
and I'm going to do a quick ten minute thing.

5989
03:47:49.150 --> 03:47:50.368
MATT: What corner are you pulling into?

5990
03:47:50.368 --> 03:47:51.445
TALIESIN: That one over there.

5991
03:47:51.445 --> 03:47:52.628
MATT: Okay.

5992
03:47:52.628 --> 03:47:54.688
TALIESIN: Yeah, we are getting far away from anyone.

5993
03:47:54.688 --> 03:47:56.085
MATT: You guys move into this far corner.

5994
03:47:56.085 --> 03:47:59.417
LIAM: Caleb is crouching down and watching.

5995
03:47:59.417 --> 03:48:01.120
MATT: The rest of you are over here.

5996
03:48:01.120 --> 03:48:01.953
TALIESIN: Where's my...

5997
03:48:03.461 --> 03:48:05.933
SAM: As they gather, I'm going to search the giant for loot.

5998
03:48:05.933 --> 03:48:07.877
(laughter)

5999
03:48:07.877 --> 03:48:08.710
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.

6000
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:09.910
MATT: The one over here?

6001
03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:10.743
SAM: Yeah.

6002
03:48:10.743 --> 03:48:11.592
MATT: Okay.

6003
03:48:11.592 --> 03:48:14.075
Well, a couple things, first off.

6004
03:48:14.075 --> 03:48:17.936
As you enter the chamber, Caduceus?

6005
03:48:17.936 --> 03:48:18.769
TALIESIN: Mm hm.

6006
03:48:18.769 --> 03:48:20.269
MATT: You notice this.

6007
03:48:21.686 --> 03:48:24.213
Underneath one of these stone tables

6008
03:48:24.213 --> 03:48:28.954
there's a faint glow that catches your eye.

6009
03:48:28.954 --> 03:48:32.286
You glance over and there underneath the table,

6010
03:48:32.286 --> 03:48:36.679
you see a jagged line drawn in the air

6011
03:48:36.679 --> 03:48:38.480
that is slightly wide.

6012
03:48:39.505 --> 03:48:42.146
A faint dull reddish purple glow underneath it.

6013
03:48:42.146 --> 03:48:43.271
TALIESIN: Can you take care of this?

6014
03:48:43.271 --> 03:48:44.362
LAURA: I think so, hold on.

6015
03:48:44.362 --> 03:48:46.645
SAM: Wait, but before you get rid of it,

6016
03:48:46.645 --> 03:48:49.263
just examine it to see if it goes to the same place.

6017
03:48:49.263 --> 03:48:52.884
Does it look the same as the one we saw before?

6018
03:48:52.884 --> 03:48:54.962
MATT: It looks--I mean, it looks like a

6019
03:48:54.962 --> 03:48:59.467
similar tear that's aloft.

6020
03:48:59.467 --> 03:49:01.787
SAM: Can we see through to the other side?

6021
03:49:01.787 --> 03:49:02.768
MATT: Make a perception check.

6022
03:49:02.768 --> 03:49:03.930
SAM: Me?

6023
03:49:03.930 --> 03:49:04.930
I'm terrible at this.

6024
03:49:04.930 --> 03:49:05.914
14.

6025
03:49:05.914 --> 03:49:07.038
LIAM: Oh, that's pretty good.

6026
03:49:07.038 --> 03:49:08.704
MATT: 14, you look through.

6027
03:49:11.071 --> 03:49:12.204
TRAVIS: (whooshing sound)

6028
03:49:12.204 --> 03:49:13.037
MATT: (laughs)

6029
03:49:13.037 --> 03:49:15.813
SAM: I don't even know if I saw the last one.

6030
03:49:15.813 --> 03:49:18.900
MATT: This one, it's a different perspective.

6031
03:49:18.900 --> 03:49:19.898
What you saw previously was

6032
03:49:19.898 --> 03:49:22.356
a dark reddish rocky interior.

6033
03:49:22.356 --> 03:49:23.770
This side is a forest.

6034
03:49:23.770 --> 03:49:24.603
LAURA: Oh.

6035
03:49:24.603 --> 03:49:25.610
MATT: A very very deep forest.

6036
03:49:25.610 --> 03:49:26.443
LIAM: Oh wow.

6037
03:49:28.003 --> 03:49:31.471
MATT: It's odd because the trees are moving.

6038
03:49:31.471 --> 03:49:33.677
The branches shift and what you can see

6039
03:49:33.677 --> 03:49:36.314
is the tips of these branches are snake heads.

6040
03:49:36.314 --> 03:49:37.147
LAURA: What?

6041
03:49:37.147 --> 03:49:38.352
MATT: The branches of these trees

6042
03:49:38.352 --> 03:49:40.193
are large snakes they're all (hissing),

6043
03:49:40.193 --> 03:49:42.255
they all look in your direction.

6044
03:49:42.255 --> 03:49:43.589
TALIESIN: Close it, close it.

6045
03:49:43.589 --> 03:49:44.422
SAM: Close it! Close it!

6046
03:49:44.422 --> 03:49:45.255
I don't like this.

6047
03:49:45.255 --> 03:49:46.088
I don't like this.

6048
03:49:46.088 --> 03:49:47.709
LAURA: I use the Dispel Magic and I try to close her.

6049
03:49:47.709 --> 03:49:49.327
MATT: Roll d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

6050
03:49:49.327 --> 03:49:50.186
SAM: Oh shit.

6051
03:49:50.186 --> 03:49:51.436
TRAVIS: Do a good roll.

6052
03:49:53.469 --> 03:49:54.302
LAURA: Oh.

6053
03:49:54.302 --> 03:49:56.863
Why am I rolling so bad tonight?

6054
03:49:56.863 --> 03:49:58.363
Wisdom modifier.

6055
03:49:59.602 --> 03:50:00.604
Ten.

6056
03:50:00.604 --> 03:50:01.439
MATT: Ten.

6057
03:50:01.439 --> 03:50:05.527
Dispel Magic hits and you see it shrink slightly,

6058
03:50:05.527 --> 03:50:07.320
but it's still holding.

6059
03:50:07.320 --> 03:50:09.493
ASHLEY: Can I just use Magician's Judge--?

6060
03:50:09.493 --> 03:50:10.326
MATT: Yes, you can.

6061
03:50:10.326 --> 03:50:11.708
ASHLEY: --to dispel the rest of the--

6062
03:50:11.708 --> 03:50:12.541
TRAVIS: Yeah!

6063
03:50:12.541 --> 03:50:13.426
MATT: Just roll a d20 for me.

6064
03:50:13.426 --> 03:50:14.259
MARISHA: Yashley!

6065
03:50:14.259 --> 03:50:15.847
(laughter)

6066
03:50:15.847 --> 03:50:17.266
ASHLEY: Do I add anything to it?

6067
03:50:17.266 --> 03:50:18.941
MATT: I'll tell you in a second.

6068
03:50:20.967 --> 03:50:22.024
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

6069
03:50:22.024 --> 03:50:24.306
(exclamations)

6070
03:50:24.306 --> 03:50:25.191
LAURA: That's much better.

6071
03:50:25.191 --> 03:50:27.589
(laughter)

6072
03:50:27.589 --> 03:50:28.786
TRAVIS: Go to jail.

6073
03:50:28.786 --> 03:50:31.393
MATT: As Jester diminishes a part

6074
03:50:31.393 --> 03:50:33.575
of this portal, leaving it in this somewhat,

6075
03:50:33.575 --> 03:50:36.508
in a somewhat unstable position,

6076
03:50:36.508 --> 03:50:38.763
Ashley steps forward, holds forth Magician's Judge.

6077
03:50:38.763 --> 03:50:39.922
SAM: Ashley steps (laughs)...

6078
03:50:39.922 --> 03:50:41.340
MATT: No, not Yasha, Ashley.

6079
03:50:41.340 --> 03:50:43.714
(laughter)

6080
03:50:43.714 --> 03:50:46.615
She breaks through the fourth wall.

6081
03:50:46.615 --> 03:50:49.198
(laughter)

6082
03:50:50.189 --> 03:50:51.698
ASHLEY: It's Ace Ventura out of the...

6083
03:50:51.698 --> 03:50:54.281
(laughter)

6084
03:50:55.316 --> 03:50:57.580
MATT: You watch as Yasha steps forward

6085
03:50:57.580 --> 03:50:59.382
and, much like the Eye of Thundara,

6086
03:50:59.382 --> 03:51:00.813
takes Magician's Judge in front

6087
03:51:00.813 --> 03:51:02.568
and focuses and concentrates.

6088
03:51:02.568 --> 03:51:04.615
There's a flash of arcane energy

6089
03:51:04.615 --> 03:51:07.858
off the runes that begin to glow and emanate up the front

6090
03:51:07.858 --> 03:51:09.474
of the blade and you watch as the light

6091
03:51:09.474 --> 03:51:10.654
focuses into a singular beam

6092
03:51:10.654 --> 03:51:12.316
that blasts the center of this.

6093
03:51:12.316 --> 03:51:13.819
Jester, seeing this refocuses

6094
03:51:13.819 --> 03:51:16.763
her Dispel Magic and the combination

6095
03:51:16.763 --> 03:51:18.620
of the two of you at once causes the rift to

6096
03:51:18.620 --> 03:51:21.036
(crackling) (pop) and vanish.

6097
03:51:21.036 --> 03:51:21.996
TRAVIS: Nice.

6098
03:51:21.996 --> 03:51:24.418
TALIESIN: 13 hit points to you.

6099
03:51:24.418 --> 03:51:25.251
TRAVIS: Yeah.

6100
03:51:25.251 --> 03:51:26.084
TALIESIN: You.

6101
03:51:26.084 --> 03:51:26.951
Two.

6102
03:51:26.951 --> 03:51:28.791
I have three more to give out.

6103
03:51:28.791 --> 03:51:30.390
SAM: Give another one to Fjord (laughs).

6104
03:51:30.390 --> 03:51:31.390
MARISHA: 13?

6105
03:51:32.267 --> 03:51:33.247
LAURA: But he's got a max.

6106
03:51:33.247 --> 03:51:36.332
TRAVIS: I also feel like my normal healthy self

6107
03:51:36.332 --> 03:51:37.751
has been diminished by--

6108
03:51:37.751 --> 03:51:38.791
MARISHA: Yeah, it's tough.

6109
03:51:38.791 --> 03:51:39.927
TRAVIS: --quite a fuck ton.

6110
03:51:39.927 --> 03:51:41.646
SAM: Maybe you sit out the next round.

6111
03:51:42.729 --> 03:51:43.626
LAURA: How do we heal that?

6112
03:51:43.626 --> 03:51:45.328
How do we make you better, Fjord?

6113
03:51:45.328 --> 03:51:46.161
SAM: Can we restore?

6114
03:51:46.161 --> 03:51:46.994
Can we restore?

6115
03:51:46.994 --> 03:51:47.827
That's you, that's you.

6116
03:51:47.827 --> 03:51:48.660
Come on.

6117
03:51:48.660 --> 03:51:50.228
LAURA: I don't have that spell.

6118
03:51:50.228 --> 03:51:51.061
SAM: Sure you do.

6119
03:51:51.061 --> 03:51:52.684
Of course, all clerics prepare

6120
03:51:52.684 --> 03:51:54.114
some sort of restoration spell.

6121
03:51:54.114 --> 03:51:55.930
TALIESIN: Would it be, is this a thing

6122
03:51:55.930 --> 03:51:59.015
that would be Lesser or Greater Restoration?

6123
03:52:00.240 --> 03:52:01.890
MATT: Make a wisdom check for me.

6124
03:52:01.890 --> 03:52:03.650
LAURA: I don't think I have either.

6125
03:52:03.650 --> 03:52:04.483
TALIESIN: Not wisdom--

6126
03:52:04.483 --> 03:52:05.591
MATT: Actually, make a medicine check

6127
03:52:05.591 --> 03:52:07.052
because you're inspecting the wounds

6128
03:52:07.052 --> 03:52:09.682
and the corruption with it.

6129
03:52:09.682 --> 03:52:10.707
SAM: The literal worst.

6130
03:52:10.707 --> 03:52:11.540
TALIESIN: 12.

6131
03:52:11.540 --> 03:52:14.194
TRAVIS: I'm helping him with it because health--help me.

6132
03:52:14.194 --> 03:52:15.575
MATT: All right, I'll allow it.

6133
03:52:15.575 --> 03:52:16.935
(laughter)

6134
03:52:16.935 --> 03:52:18.015
MATT: I'll allow it.

6135
03:52:18.015 --> 03:52:19.778
Usually got to say it beforehand.

6136
03:52:19.778 --> 03:52:20.611
TALIESIN: 20.

6137
03:52:20.611 --> 03:52:21.444
MATT: All right, 20.

6138
03:52:21.444 --> 03:52:22.540
TALIESIN: Where does it hurt?

6139
03:52:22.540 --> 03:52:23.761
MATT: Whatever the corruption within

6140
03:52:23.761 --> 03:52:25.984
these wounds is, it is pretty intense.

6141
03:52:25.984 --> 03:52:29.063
It is fiendish by nature and you gather

6142
03:52:29.063 --> 03:52:31.563
this would probably require more than a lesser.

6143
03:52:31.563 --> 03:52:32.764
TALIESIN: It would be a Greater Restoration.

6144
03:52:32.764 --> 03:52:36.077
MATT: It would be a Greater Restoration to correct this.

6145
03:52:36.077 --> 03:52:37.222
TALIESIN: I don't have Greater Restoration right now.

6146
03:52:37.222 --> 03:52:38.413
SAM: Why don't we just sit you out for

6147
03:52:38.413 --> 03:52:40.121
the next round of this stuff.

6148
03:52:41.494 --> 03:52:43.364
TRAVIS: But I want to play.

6149
03:52:43.364 --> 03:52:44.444
No you're right, I'm going to stop.

6150
03:52:44.444 --> 03:52:46.382
SAM: There's nothing we can do.

6151
03:52:46.382 --> 03:52:47.404
ASHLEY: Stay here for the moment.

6152
03:52:47.404 --> 03:52:49.666
We'll see what the rest of this place has

6153
03:52:49.666 --> 03:52:50.883
and we'll come back from you.

6154
03:52:50.883 --> 03:52:52.701
TRAVIS: I'll make sure nobody makes it past you.

6155
03:52:52.701 --> 03:52:53.534
How about that?

6156
03:52:53.534 --> 03:52:55.200
TALIESIN: Yeah. I burned my fifth already

6157
03:52:55.200 --> 03:52:56.033
because we only have--

6158
03:52:56.033 --> 03:52:58.953
we have, like, 40 more minutes of you with the--

6159
03:52:58.953 --> 03:53:00.818
MARISHA: I could scout. I could--

6160
03:53:00.818 --> 03:53:02.301
I don't want to go anywhere without my captain.

6161
03:53:02.301 --> 03:53:03.868
TALIESIN: We should all move together

6162
03:53:03.868 --> 03:53:05.145
but I think, yeah.
LIAM: Does Caleb hear, smell,

6163
03:53:05.145 --> 03:53:08.505
or see anything from where he is?

6164
03:53:08.505 --> 03:53:09.612
MATT: Make a perception check.

6165
03:53:09.612 --> 03:53:10.445
LIAM: Okay.

6166
03:53:10.445 --> 03:53:12.445
SAM: I was checking the body.

6167
03:53:12.445 --> 03:53:13.794
MATT: Make a perception check as well.

6168
03:53:13.794 --> 03:53:14.627
LIAM: Total shit.

6169
03:53:14.627 --> 03:53:15.527
Eight.

6170
03:53:15.527 --> 03:53:16.508
MATT: You don't see anything.

6171
03:53:16.508 --> 03:53:18.247
SAM: Perception or investigation?

6172
03:53:18.247 --> 03:53:19.468
MATT: Perception at first.

6173
03:53:19.468 --> 03:53:20.301
SAM: 16.

6174
03:53:20.301 --> 03:53:21.330
MATT: 16, okay.

6175
03:53:21.330 --> 03:53:24.268
You approach the body and the body itself is torn in two.

6176
03:53:24.268 --> 03:53:26.322
It's nowhere near as pulled apart as the other one,

6177
03:53:26.322 --> 03:53:29.127
but there is still a good amount of flesh on this.

6178
03:53:29.127 --> 03:53:30.735
You approach it

6179
03:53:30.735 --> 03:53:32.810
and this little bit of light catches your eye

6180
03:53:32.810 --> 03:53:34.039
and you're like, "Oh, is it another rift?"

6181
03:53:34.039 --> 03:53:37.451
You look up and there's this beautiful little jellyfish.

6182
03:53:37.451 --> 03:53:40.724
This jellyfish that emerges out of the wall like--

6183
03:53:40.724 --> 03:53:41.607
LAURA: (distrusting) Mm-mm.

6184
03:53:41.607 --> 03:53:44.604
MATT: It drifts and then touches and enters the body.

6185
03:53:44.604 --> 03:53:45.853
TALIESIN: No. Goddamn it.

6186
03:53:45.853 --> 03:53:46.728
TRAVIS: Of who? Of what?

6187
03:53:46.728 --> 03:53:47.570
MATT: Of the corpse.

6188
03:53:47.570 --> 03:53:49.352
You watch the giant's head go (cracking).

6189
03:53:49.352 --> 03:53:51.193
SAM: Uh, guys. Guys.

6190
03:53:51.193 --> 03:53:52.834
MATT: And look right towards you with

6191
03:53:52.834 --> 03:53:54.250
this terrible grin that begins to tear.

6192
03:53:54.250 --> 03:53:55.575
Its jaw unhinges to the point

6193
03:53:55.575 --> 03:53:57.117
where the flesh tears at the corners

6194
03:53:57.117 --> 03:53:59.495
into this wide twisted smile.

6195
03:53:59.495 --> 03:54:00.328
TRAVIS: No, no.

6196
03:54:00.328 --> 03:54:01.362
MATT: That's we'll pick up next week.

6197
03:54:01.362 --> 03:54:03.567
ALL: No!

6198
03:54:03.567 --> 03:54:04.400
MARISHA: Why, though?

6199
03:54:04.400 --> 03:54:06.249
MATT: Because it's almost 11 o'clock.

6200
03:54:06.249 --> 03:54:07.082
LIAM: No!

6201
03:54:07.082 --> 03:54:08.849
TALIESIN: I'm into it. I'm into it.

6202
03:54:08.849 --> 03:54:10.563
We cool. We cool.

6203
03:54:10.563 --> 03:54:12.333
That's the other thing. If you go down, you're

6204
03:54:12.333 --> 03:54:13.699
just going to get up again.

6205
03:54:13.699 --> 03:54:16.160
MARISHA: That was such a good game.

6206
03:54:16.160 --> 03:54:18.121
MATT: We're still going.

6207
03:54:18.121 --> 03:54:19.576
TALIESIN: I'm excited.

6208
03:54:19.576 --> 03:54:20.802
I'm built for this room.

6209
03:54:20.802 --> 03:54:22.722
I'm going to tear some shit up, man.

6210
03:54:22.722 --> 03:54:25.202
MARISHA: You can fight from a far distance, right?

6211
03:54:25.202 --> 03:54:27.740
Like 120 is a far distance.
LIAM: That was cool.

6212
03:54:27.740 --> 03:54:29.740
TRAVIS: I'll pull a wizard move; get the fuck out.

6213
03:54:29.740 --> 03:54:30.839
MATT: (laughs)

6214
03:54:30.839 --> 03:54:32.748
LIAM: (like a kid) What's that thing?

6215
03:54:32.748 --> 03:54:34.631
MATT: It was one of the various structures

6216
03:54:34.631 --> 03:54:36.389
that were built in this crafting room.

6217
03:54:36.389 --> 03:54:37.735
You can see a statue that's partially made--

6218
03:54:37.735 --> 03:54:39.234
TALIESIN: Sometimes it's just parts.

6219
03:54:39.234 --> 03:54:40.613
MATT: Yeah, there's a lot of things in there

6220
03:54:40.613 --> 03:54:42.046
that are partially made and sculpted,

6221
03:54:42.046 --> 03:54:44.359
stone work. This room was used for stone crafting.

6222
03:54:44.359 --> 03:54:46.280
LIAM: (like a kid) That's a big boss. That one, Taliesin.

6223
03:54:46.280 --> 03:54:47.238
MATT: Could be.

6224
03:54:47.238 --> 03:54:48.370
LIAM: That's the fucked up boss.

6225
03:54:48.370 --> 03:54:49.420
TALIESIN: Is that the big boss?

6226
03:54:49.420 --> 03:54:50.503
MATT: So we'll pick up on this next week.

6227
03:54:50.503 --> 03:54:51.453
TALIESIN: That looks like the statue you move

6228
03:54:51.453 --> 03:54:52.636
to unlock another potion.

6229
03:54:52.636 --> 03:54:53.469
LAURA: That's the big boy.

6230
03:54:53.469 --> 03:54:55.363
MATT: I will move--

6231
03:54:55.363 --> 03:54:57.391
SAM: Did you take a picture of where we were and stuff?

6232
03:54:57.391 --> 03:54:58.916
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's photograph for posterity.

6233
03:54:58.916 --> 03:55:00.008
MARISHA: What a game.

6234
03:55:01.532 --> 03:55:02.615
LIAM: Got it.

6235
03:55:03.756 --> 03:55:04.898
TALIESIN: I'm going to ruin everything.

6236
03:55:04.898 --> 03:55:05.731
LIAM: Got it.

6237
03:55:05.731 --> 03:55:07.014
SAM: You got it?

6238
03:55:07.014 --> 03:55:07.855
MATT: All right.

6239
03:55:07.855 --> 03:55:08.905
We'll leave this here for next week.

6240
03:55:08.905 --> 03:55:09.986
We'll take it from there.

6241
03:55:09.986 --> 03:55:12.610
In the mean time, guys, we're going to take

6242
03:55:12.610 --> 03:55:13.746
a little half an hour break here,

6243
03:55:13.746 --> 03:55:14.731
get ourselves situated

6244
03:55:14.731 --> 03:55:16.749
and then at 11:30,

6245
03:55:16.749 --> 03:55:20.032
about 30 minutes from now, approximately. Yeah.

6246
03:55:20.032 --> 03:55:20.865
MARISHA: What was it now?

6247
03:55:20.865 --> 03:55:22.475
MATT: 34 minutes from now we're going to be closing

6248
03:55:22.475 --> 03:55:24.841
up the Kickstarter with a countdown.

6249
03:55:24.841 --> 03:55:25.905
Hanging out, watching the final moments

6250
03:55:25.905 --> 03:55:27.707
to with our friend, Joel Hodgson,

6251
03:55:27.707 --> 03:55:29.627
from Mystery Science Theater will be here with us.

6252
03:55:29.627 --> 03:55:30.768
Super excited.

6253
03:55:30.768 --> 03:55:31.867
MARISHA: A friend!

6254
03:55:31.867 --> 03:55:32.848
MATT: I know! It's crazy to say that!

6255
03:55:32.848 --> 03:55:33.744
What the shit is life?

6256
03:55:33.744 --> 03:55:34.577
I don't even know.

6257
03:55:34.577 --> 03:55:35.904
(laughter)

6258
03:55:35.904 --> 03:55:37.820
Anyway, we'll see you guys hopefully here shortly.

6259
03:55:37.820 --> 03:55:40.962
So (hands rubbing), because some of you have to go,

6260
03:55:40.962 --> 03:55:41.937
and because it's the end of the episode,

6261
03:55:41.937 --> 03:55:43.237
I'll say, thank you so much,

6262
03:55:43.237 --> 03:55:45.147
we love you very much, and

6263
03:55:45.147 --> 03:55:45.980
is it Thursday yet?

6264
03:55:45.980 --> 03:55:46.813
LIAM: Aw.

6265
03:55:46.813 --> 03:55:47.646
SAM: No, it's not.

6266
03:55:47.646 --> 03:55:48.629
MATT: Goodnight. See you soon.

6267
03:55:48.629 --> 03:55:49.462
Like real soon.

6268
03:55:49.462 --> 03:55:51.236
(cheering)

6269
03:55:51.236 --> 03:55:56.119
(dramatic music)

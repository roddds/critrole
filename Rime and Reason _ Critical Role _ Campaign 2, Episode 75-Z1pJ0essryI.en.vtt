00:00:00.195 --> 00:00:02.043
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.043 --> 00:00:04.220
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.839
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.771
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:12.286
MATT: We do have-- after the announcements, our friend Liam

6
00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:14.494
is going to be attempting to Skype in for the game.

7
00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:16.471
He is out in the middle of nowhere,

8
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:19.124
but has apparently gotten some aid from some Critters

9
00:00:19.124 --> 00:00:21.207
at the place he's staying, and we're hoping

10
00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:22.302
the connection's enough on get him through here,

11
00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:23.375
so we're going to try.

12
00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:27.377
So thank you, whoever you are helping Liam out on that end.

13
00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:28.945
So before we get into it, we have some
announcements to get through.

14
00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:32.435
First and foremost, we have two wonderful sponsors tonight.

15
00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:34.745
First, our friends since the beginning of campaign two,

16
00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:37.749
and the ones who endure this gentleman every week,

17
00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:39.993
D&amp;D Beyond, Sam?
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

18
00:00:39.993 --> 00:00:43.125
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond. Happy birthday, D&amp;D Beyond.

19
00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.391
This week marks the second anniversary

20
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:48.535
of our favorite official digital tool set

21
00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:50.574
for Fifth Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

22
00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:52.941
Join us in wishing them well and check it out

23
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:56.663
if you have not at dndbeyond.com.

24
00:00:56.663 --> 00:00:59.595
Now, often Laura goes next in the announcements

25
00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:02.000
with merch stuff, but I always feel like there could be

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.700
more stuff focusing on my characters,

27
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.400
so I thought I'd use some of my time tonight

28
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.884
to pitch a few merch ideas to Laura.

29
00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:10.762
LAURA: Oh, okay.

30
00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:12.172
SAM: Now these are just prototypes.

31
00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.830
They're not finished products.

32
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.753
But maybe if you guys like them and she likes them,

33
00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:19.770
you can find these things in the Crit Role store

34
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.514
later this year.
LAURA: Hmm.

35
00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:22.814
SAM: First up:

36
00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:25.375
Nott's Bag of Buttons.

37
00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:26.740
(laughter)

38
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.837
SAM: Our favorite goblin rogue loves buttons,

39
00:01:28.837 --> 00:01:30.190
and so will you when you pick up

40
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.954
this limited edition giant sack of stolen buttons.

41
00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:34.633
Buttons sold separately.

42
00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:36.347
(laughter)

43
00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:37.921
TRAVIS: Is that a resealable plastic bag?

44
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:38.994
SAM: Shut up, Travis.

45
00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:40.327
(laughter)

46
00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:44.005
SAM: Collect all 743. Warning, choking hazard.

47
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.320
TALIESIN: I was about to ask.
(laughter)

48
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.161
SAM: Next, Doty would always comb and maintain

49
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:51.053
Taryon Darrington's hair and beard,

50
00:01:51.053 --> 00:01:55.036
and now you can, too, with Chia Taryon.

51
00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:57.896
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

52
00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:00.159
SAM: With a little sunlight, water, and love,

53
00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.661
you, too, can have fun, fun, fun with your own

54
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.436
Taryon Gary Darrington.

55
00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:06.532
Warning, contains choking hazard.

56
00:02:06.532 --> 00:02:07.863
(laughter)

57
00:02:07.863 --> 00:02:09.426
TRAVIS: ♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia ♪

58
00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:10.799
MATT: ♪ Ch-ch-ch-choking ♪

59
00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.993
SAM: Oh, and for our younger viewers, you might have

60
00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:16.609
a fancy doll house, but you don't have a magnificent one.

61
00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.015
This is going to break.

62
00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:20.617
LAURA: Oh god. Oh god.
TRAVIS: How big is this?

63
00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:22.284
MICA: Oh no!
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

64
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:26.359
LAURA: I like to sell <i>quality</i> items in our store.

65
00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.942
SAM: It's a prototype.
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

66
00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:32.817
SAM: Introducing Scanlan's Magnificent Doll House,

67
00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:37.187
complete with vegan kitchen, training pit, and a sex room.

68
00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:39.243
(laughter)

69
00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:41.500
SAM: Invisible servants included.

70
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.023
See, they're right there.

71
00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:45.596
TRAVIS: Is that a toilet?

72
00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:46.653
SAM: I don't know.

73
00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:48.006
TRAVIS: Right there below your right hand.

74
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:49.581
MARISHA: Yes, that's a toilet.

75
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:52.467
TRAVIS: Okay, on the side of the-- yeah.

76
00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:54.508
SAM: There's some poop in there!

77
00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:55.429
(laughter)

78
00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.054
TRAVIS: Is it blue?
SAM: Yep.

79
00:02:58.054 --> 00:03:01.831
Last but not least, for our adult Critters

80
00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:03.831
who want to spice things up in the bedroom.

81
00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:04.831
LAURA: Oh no.

82
00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:07.647
SAM: Strap on this shiny new cube cock ring.

83
00:03:07.647 --> 00:03:09.567
(laughter)

84
00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:13.607
SAM: Just like the kind worn by Scanlan himself.

85
00:03:13.607 --> 00:03:16.745
This sterling silver wanger hanger

86
00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:20.605
will make your love life sing all night long.

87
00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:24.567
Warning, is a choking hazard.

88
00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:27.697
Be sure to tweet your favorites at Laura Bailey

89
00:03:27.697 --> 00:03:30.836
and keep checking the store to see which ones made the cut.

90
00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:34.499
LAURA: Yep, just keep on checking that store.

91
00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:35.651
TRAVIS: Wanger hanger.

92
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:37.023
LAURA: No, stop it.

93
00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:38.153
SAM: This one's been used.

94
00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:40.353
(groaning)

95
00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.001
MICA: Can I go home?

96
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:43.056
(laughter)

97
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.165
MATT: If you need to go, go.

98
00:03:45.165 --> 00:03:46.524
Thank you, Sam.

99
00:03:46.524 --> 00:03:48.839
And thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

100
00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.983
An optimal app for use in your D&amp;D games,

101
00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:53.637
where you can keep your character information

102
00:03:53.637 --> 00:03:56.241
and dungeon mastering abilities very clean, and--

103
00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:58.699
LAURA: I love how Matt always has to like actually--

104
00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.377
MATT: It's important.
SAM: That's the secret.

105
00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:03.120
MATT: Exactly, I see how this works now.

106
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.601
For our second sponsor tonight,

107
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.850
our returning friends at Idle Champions.

108
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.041
For those who aren't familiar--

109
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.800
and we thank them for their continued support.

110
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.912
They run a game called Idle Champions

111
00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:16.039
of the Forgotten Realms. It's an awesome game

112
00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.316
where you get to build your own party

113
00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:19.711
of characters from all over the D&amp;D lore universe,

114
00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:21.906
as well as numerous streams, and you get to

115
00:04:21.906 --> 00:04:23.724
put them into a party and fight through dungeons

116
00:04:23.724 --> 00:04:26.218
and adventures based on official D&amp;D adventures.

117
00:04:26.218 --> 00:04:29.896
It's available on PC, I think iOS, and Android,

118
00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:31.695
all sorts of other places. It's awesome.

119
00:04:31.695 --> 00:04:33.160
This month, Idle Champions has partnered

120
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.562
with the charity Take This, and is releasing

121
00:04:35.562 --> 00:04:39.027
the Vizier the Steller's Jay Familiar NPC Pack.

122
00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:40.648
So the pack that contains the familiar itself

123
00:04:40.648 --> 00:04:42.721
plus a variety of potions, apparently.

124
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:45.025
All the net proceeds are going to special AFK rooms,

125
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:46.244
which are volunteer-run safe spaces

126
00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.999
for anyone who feels overwhelmed

127
00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:49.907
and needs a place to stay to regain their clam

128
00:04:49.907 --> 00:04:54.177
at upcoming PAX events, which is a great thing

129
00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:56.870
that I'm so glad conventions are now beginning to provide,

130
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.349
'cause man, can those places get

131
00:04:58.349 --> 00:04:59.610
real overwhelming real fast.

132
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.329
LAURA: Yeah.
MICA: Mm-hmm.

133
00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:03.219
MATT: So go ahead and support this great cause

134
00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.252
with our fantastic friends at Idle Champions.

135
00:05:05.252 --> 00:05:08.378
You can head out to IdleChampions.com/CriticalRole

136
00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:10.847
for more details on this awesome endeavor.

137
00:05:10.847 --> 00:05:12.891
TALIESIN: That is so cool.

138
00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:15.467
MATT: All right, so we've also got, for those

139
00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:17.280
that haven't seen it, the second issue

140
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.145
of the next installment of our comic book series,

141
00:05:19.145 --> 00:05:21.392
Vox Machina Origins, came out yesterday.

142
00:05:21.392 --> 00:05:22.349
(groaning)

143
00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:23.863
Issue two.

144
00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:29.663
Fantastic cover art from our Critter artist, Will Kirkby.

145
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:32.805
It's bad-ass and it just gets more intense

146
00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:33.957
from here on out, too.

147
00:05:33.957 --> 00:05:35.165
TALIESIN: So good.
TRAVIS: Oh man.

148
00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:37.372
MATT: So some folks may know the origin history,

149
00:05:37.372 --> 00:05:38.799
we briefly discussed in the past,

150
00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:41.334
get to see all the original stories we played at home

151
00:05:41.334 --> 00:05:44.485
now played out in awesome comic fashion.

152
00:05:44.485 --> 00:05:46.766
Continues to be written by our fantastic writer Jody Houser

153
00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:48.768
in this series, too. She does an amazing job.

154
00:05:48.768 --> 00:05:50.884
Olivia, of course, is our amazing artist.

155
00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:53.184
Just super proud of this. It's getting better each time.

156
00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:54.693
So check it out if you haven't yet.

157
00:05:54.693 --> 00:05:59.693
It's available at local comic stores or digitally online.

158
00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:03.047
For Laura, you have something to note as well?

159
00:06:03.047 --> 00:06:05.088
LAURA: Oh yes, you may have noticed

160
00:06:05.088 --> 00:06:07.666
on our store online this morning,

161
00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:08.912
oh, shit I knocked it over.

162
00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:09.745
SAM: Oh god.

163
00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:10.664
(laughter)

164
00:06:10.664 --> 00:06:12.414
MATT: Well-oiled machine!

165
00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:15.754
LAURA: (trumpet fanfare)

166
00:06:15.754 --> 00:06:17.726
It's the Tal'Dorei map!

167
00:06:17.726 --> 00:06:19.176
(cheering)

168
00:06:19.176 --> 00:06:20.609
LAURA: Whoa!

169
00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:21.879
SAM: High quality paper.

170
00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:23.646
LAURA: I know!

171
00:06:23.646 --> 00:06:27.934
It's the same size as our other maps by Deven Rue.

172
00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:29.459
TALIESIN: Nice.

173
00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:31.545
LAURA: It's beautiful, it's glorious.

174
00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:33.204
You can check it out on our shop.

175
00:06:33.204 --> 00:06:35.261
TRAVIS: It's so sweet.
MARISHA: So good.

176
00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:37.564
LAURA: I know, I know.
MATT: Bad-ass.

177
00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.532
SAM: Each one come with a cock ring.

178
00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:40.735
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: No.

179
00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:41.568
SAM: No?

180
00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:42.847
MATT: That's not a thing.

181
00:06:42.847 --> 00:06:45.311
TALIESIN: That's just a shipping tube.

182
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:47.561
It's just a shipping tube, man.

183
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:48.523
You're doing it wrong.

184
00:06:48.523 --> 00:06:51.472
LAURA: It's in our US and our UK store.

185
00:06:51.472 --> 00:06:53.749
MARISHA: Round hole, square peg.

186
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:55.131
(laughter)

187
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:56.032
MATT: Square hole, rounds peg.

188
00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:57.752
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
TALIESIN: I beg to differ.

189
00:06:57.752 --> 00:06:59.328
MARISHA: That's the joke, man.

190
00:06:59.328 --> 00:07:01.542
MATT: No, it can go both ways.

191
00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:03.175
It goes both ways.

192
00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:04.008
Anyway.

193
00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.209
Thank you, Laura.

194
00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:07.505
Thank you, everyone.

195
00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:08.754
TALIESIN: Trying to get that cube joke--

196
00:07:08.754 --> 00:07:10.041
MATT: I believe that's the end of our announcements,

197
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:11.370
so let's go ahead and get us in to--

198
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.805
TRAVIS: Can I, can-- ?
MATT: Oh wait.

199
00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:13.951
TRAVIS: Thank you.

200
00:07:13.951 --> 00:07:18.901
I had the lucky, prestigious honor of joining

201
00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:21.918
the future Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys

202
00:07:21.918 --> 00:07:23.390
at their training camp--

203
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.507
SAM: Boo!

204
00:07:24.507 --> 00:07:27.123
TRAVIS: --earlier this week, and I just want to send

205
00:07:27.123 --> 00:07:31.523
a special shout-out to all-pro center Travis Frederick

206
00:07:31.523 --> 00:07:35.462
and his D&amp;D adventuring party, The Janitors,

207
00:07:35.462 --> 00:07:38.503
for allowing me and my brother to attend.

208
00:07:38.503 --> 00:07:40.686
It was amazing, they gave us gear,

209
00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:42.716
and I'm going to wear it for the fucking game.

210
00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:44.392
(laughter)

211
00:07:44.392 --> 00:07:46.347
TRAVIS: Love the Cowboys.
MATT: Yes!

212
00:07:46.347 --> 00:07:47.472
MICA: So is it safe to assume

213
00:07:47.472 --> 00:07:48.972
your favorite team is the Cowboys?

214
00:07:48.972 --> 00:07:49.805
LAURA: Yes.

215
00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:51.180
TRAVIS: I'm from Dallas! I love the Cowboys!

216
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.479
They're the best! They're the best!

217
00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:53.312
MICA: I'm sorry!

218
00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:54.392
(laughing)

219
00:07:54.392 --> 00:07:56.009
TALIESIN: This has been him all week.
MATT: Awesome.

220
00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.534
MICA: Sportsball.
MARISHA: Yeah, man.

221
00:07:57.534 --> 00:07:59.989
MATT: I have never seen him so excited.

222
00:07:59.989 --> 00:08:02.716
Thank you guys for, you know, I mean,

223
00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:07.531
Laura's a great wife, but I've never seen him this excited.

224
00:08:07.531 --> 00:08:09.103
TRAVIS: It was awesome.

225
00:08:09.103 --> 00:08:10.228
MATT: He's a father.

226
00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:11.539
MATT: You have a child.
TRAVIS: But it was awesome.

227
00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:12.442
TALIESIN: You're beaming.

228
00:08:12.442 --> 00:08:13.275
(laughter)

229
00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:14.108
TRAVIS: It was so cool.

230
00:08:14.108 --> 00:08:15.690
(laughter)

231
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.063
MATT: All righty, well, on that note,

232
00:08:19.063 --> 00:08:23.079
let's go ahead and jump in to tonight's episode of...

233
00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:25.445
(scratching sounds)

234
00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:26.650
(laughter)

235
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.483
TRAVIS: They're real sticky.

236
00:08:31.301 --> 00:08:32.460
MATT: Critical Role.

237
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.467
TRAVIS: (growling)

238
00:08:35.467 --> 00:08:37.629
(water bubbling)

239
00:08:37.629 --> 00:08:42.183

(dragon roaring)

272
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:12.262
MATT: Little late on that, Sam.

273
00:10:12.262 --> 00:10:13.220
Welcome back.

274
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.579
(laughs)

275
00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:18.654
So last we left off, as we try to get

276
00:10:18.654 --> 00:10:21.771
a Liam O'Brien to connect here.

277
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:23.003
Well-oiled machine.

278
00:10:23.003 --> 00:10:25.428
(laughter)

279
00:10:25.428 --> 00:10:27.089
MATT: Almost 200 episodes of this series.

280
00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:28.198
Well-oiled machine.

281
00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:29.296
(laughing)

282
00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:31.526
MATT: That's part of the charm, I like to think.

283
00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:34.366
So last we left off, the Mighty Nein,

284
00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:36.251
heading northward to the Greying Wildlands

285
00:10:36.251 --> 00:10:39.498
in search of the means to assemble two broken pieces

286
00:10:39.498 --> 00:10:41.171
of an artifact that they've acquired

287
00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:43.146
over the breadth of their adventures,

288
00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:45.258
as well as seek for the means to pursue

289
00:10:45.258 --> 00:10:48.083
the visions that Caduceus had received from the Wildmother,

290
00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:50.332
had found themselves in the subterranean

291
00:10:50.332 --> 00:10:52.605
dwarf-elf city of Uthodurn.

292
00:10:52.605 --> 00:10:55.545
While searching about, you encountered

293
00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:57.613
an individual named Reani.

294
00:10:57.613 --> 00:11:02.319
Reani, who was a vigilante protector, it seems,

295
00:11:02.319 --> 00:11:05.875
of the local neighborhood, and had an aligned interest

296
00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:08.957
in the venture that you were notified,

297
00:11:08.957 --> 00:11:11.568
that required a white dragon to be sought

298
00:11:11.568 --> 00:11:14.567
to acquire this material known as iceflex,

299
00:11:14.567 --> 00:11:17.502
which is mithral treated with the breath of a white dragon.

300
00:11:17.502 --> 00:11:20.280
A dangerous mission, you researched where this white dragon

301
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.988
may be, and with the help of your ally there,

302
00:11:22.988 --> 00:11:25.002
acquire some materials, make some connections,

303
00:11:25.002 --> 00:11:27.922
and prepare yourselves for the journey.

304
00:11:27.922 --> 00:11:31.888
You called in an additional favor with Shadowhand Essek,

305
00:11:31.888 --> 00:11:34.876
teleported northward to the Myth Burrow,

306
00:11:34.876 --> 00:11:39.359
which seems to be the den, or domain,

307
00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:41.285
depending how you want to pronounce it, of this entity,

308
00:11:41.285 --> 00:11:45.518
this white dragon known as Gelidon, the Nightmare in Ivory.

309
00:11:47.561 --> 00:11:49.669
MARISHA: I'm sorry. We were trying to remember exactly--

310
00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:51.048
yeah, as you were saying.

311
00:11:51.048 --> 00:11:52.407
MICA: We just didn't know what the adjective was.

312
00:11:52.407 --> 00:11:53.648
MATT: No worries.

313
00:11:55.092 --> 00:11:59.524
You arrive via teleportation to the outskirts

314
00:11:59.524 --> 00:12:03.090
of this mountain at the base, being blasted

315
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.850
with wind and snow and ice. Glancing up, you can see

316
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.675
a little ways up a cavern

317
00:12:09.675 --> 00:12:11.513
that enters into the base of the mountain

318
00:12:11.513 --> 00:12:14.496
with icy veins

319
00:12:14.496 --> 00:12:17.810
curling out from this entrance.

320
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.879
And that was where we left off.

321
00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:22.484
So as the wind is howling through,

322
00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:26.375
being spattered and smacked with hail and hard snow,

323
00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:29.474
Essek immediately takes a step back and goes,

324
00:12:29.474 --> 00:12:33.386
"All right, friends. I'm not staying very long.

325
00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:35.813
"This is ridiculous, have fun," and turns around

326
00:12:35.813 --> 00:12:36.818
and starts walking away.

327
00:12:36.818 --> 00:12:37.817
LAURA: Thank you!

328
00:12:37.817 --> 00:12:39.600
TRAVIS: Walking or hovering?

329
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.587
MATT: Hard to tell at this distance.

330
00:12:40.587 --> 00:12:41.737
LAURA: What about his footprints? Is he leaving

331
00:12:41.737 --> 00:12:43.398
footprints in the snow?

332
00:12:43.398 --> 00:12:44.559
MATT: Make a perception check.

333
00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.794
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, first roll of the night!

334
00:12:45.794 --> 00:12:47.917
(laughter)

335
00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:51.317
LAURA: I don't have my stuff, oh my god!

336
00:12:51.317 --> 00:12:52.428
SAM: Plus four to--
LAURA: Is it?

337
00:12:52.428 --> 00:12:53.436
SAM: Plus five?

338
00:12:53.436 --> 00:12:55.302
LAURA: Is it 14? 14?

339
00:12:55.302 --> 00:12:57.449
MARISHA: Tell me it's a single tire track.

340
00:12:57.449 --> 00:12:58.718
Just one.

341
00:12:58.718 --> 00:13:02.201
MICA: Like a snail?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

342
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:04.248
MATT: It's two wheelie tracks.

343
00:13:04.248 --> 00:13:05.763
LAURA: Oh! 15.

344
00:13:05.763 --> 00:13:06.721
MATT: 15?

345
00:13:06.721 --> 00:13:08.174
What'd you--
TALIESIN: Oh, like 11.

346
00:13:08.174 --> 00:13:09.132
MATT: 11? Okay.

347
00:13:09.132 --> 00:13:11.877
What you do see-- you don't see any footsteps.

348
00:13:11.877 --> 00:13:15.502
What you see are two grooves dragging forward.

349
00:13:15.502 --> 00:13:16.378
SAM: He's on skates?

350
00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:17.984
MICA: It's his toes!
MATT: It's his toes.

351
00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:20.663
TALIESIN: He's hovering, but the snow is too--

352
00:13:20.663 --> 00:13:21.704
LAURA: Oh, wow.

353
00:13:21.704 --> 00:13:23.392
MICA: Is he wearing shoes?

354
00:13:23.392 --> 00:13:26.272
MATT: You can't tell. The cloak goes just past that.

355
00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:27.948
MICA: Hope his toes are okay.

356
00:13:27.948 --> 00:13:29.136
MATT: Probably pretty cold at this point.

357
00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:30.360
TALIESIN: You can get frostbite that way.

358
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.326
That's pretty heavy.

359
00:13:31.326 --> 00:13:32.367
MATT: (chuckling)

360
00:13:32.367 --> 00:13:34.200
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, here we are.

361
00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:36.646
SAM: Hi.

362
00:13:36.646 --> 00:13:40.422
TALIESIN: Well, I'm really glad we bought jackets.

363
00:13:40.422 --> 00:13:41.637
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

364
00:13:41.637 --> 00:13:45.304
TALIESIN: Do we want to maybe batten down somewhere?

365
00:13:46.252 --> 00:13:50.087
LAURA: Is there anything nearby, like a-- not a dragon cave.

366
00:13:50.087 --> 00:13:51.373
MICA: Please not that cave.

367
00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:53.103
TALIESIN: Are there any other clearings or caves?

368
00:13:53.103 --> 00:13:55.270
Is there anywhere that seems like it might give us shelter

369
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.954
that isn't the big entrance of doom?

370
00:13:58.954 --> 00:14:01.357
MATT: Make a perception check in the space.

371
00:14:01.357 --> 00:14:02.373
TALIESIN: (groans)

372
00:14:02.373 --> 00:14:04.507
MATT: I'll say, at the storm at this distance,

373
00:14:04.507 --> 00:14:07.523
do it with disadvantage, just because

374
00:14:07.523 --> 00:14:09.917
your vision is somewhat obscured by the storm--

375
00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:11.700
LAURA: Can I look, too, because I said it, too?

376
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.533
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: 11.

377
00:14:12.533 --> 00:14:13.705
LAURA: I did say it.

378
00:14:13.705 --> 00:14:15.147
TALIESIN: I was fine before disadvantage.

379
00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:17.185
MATT: Sorry, man.
LAURA: Oh, disadvantage.

380
00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:18.768
MATT: Weather's shitty.

381
00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:23.766
LAURA: 13?
MATT: 13.

382
00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:26.569
Looking around, there might be a couple of rocks

383
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:28.714
you could try and push yourselves up against

384
00:14:28.714 --> 00:14:31.362
to get out of the extent of the storm,

385
00:14:31.362 --> 00:14:35.089
but there's no other shelter-like caverns

386
00:14:35.089 --> 00:14:37.600
within the mountain that are immediately in the vicinity.

387
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.121
The teleportation spell was very accurate

388
00:14:39.121 --> 00:14:40.739
and brought you straight towards the base

389
00:14:40.739 --> 00:14:42.691
of Mythburrow per your request.

390
00:14:42.691 --> 00:14:44.232
MARISHA: When we look up, can we see any

391
00:14:44.232 --> 00:14:46.345
caves in the mountainside?

392
00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:48.023
MATT: That's what they were looking for.

393
00:14:48.023 --> 00:14:48.856
MARISHA: Oh.

394
00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:51.071
MICA: Can you see inside the giant mouth of the cave?

395
00:14:51.071 --> 00:14:53.317
MATT: It looks like it's a couple of hundred feet from you,

396
00:14:53.317 --> 00:14:54.987
so you're not able to tell at this distance,

397
00:14:54.987 --> 00:14:57.416
with all the mess of weather pushing in its way.

398
00:14:57.416 --> 00:14:58.563
You'd have to get closer to look.

399
00:14:58.563 --> 00:15:00.555
TRAVIS: With the mess of weather,

400
00:15:00.555 --> 00:15:03.585
daylight breaking through at all, time of day?

401
00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:05.061
MATT: No daylight breaking through.

402
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:07.480
You guys had taken a day's rest before traveling

403
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.486
to Rosohna, so if I recall, and we'll say for now

404
00:15:11.486 --> 00:15:13.834
it's like midday, maybe early afternoon.

405
00:15:13.834 --> 00:15:18.314
So there's light out, but the sky itself is dark gray,

406
00:15:18.314 --> 00:15:22.047
heavy clouds, coming through storm, not quite blizzard,

407
00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.834
but it's still an intense storm.

408
00:15:23.834 --> 00:15:25.957
TRAVIS: And several hundred yards to the mouth of the cave.

409
00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:28.840
Vegetation, trees, in the distance, or--?

410
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.838
LAURA: Several hundred yards to the base of the mountain

411
00:15:31.838 --> 00:15:34.220
or to the mouth of the--
MATT: To the mouth of the cave.

412
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.624
There are levels where it evens off

413
00:15:36.624 --> 00:15:38.634
and then climbs up further and then climbs up further.

414
00:15:38.634 --> 00:15:40.028
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

415
00:15:40.028 --> 00:15:42.633
MATT: From what you can see, there are a handful

416
00:15:42.633 --> 00:15:45.599
of leafless tree trunks with

417
00:15:45.599 --> 00:15:48.359
completely barren branches

418
00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:50.060
that are visible at certain points,

419
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.288
even just in the vicinity around you

420
00:15:51.288 --> 00:15:53.647
and along the mountains here.

421
00:15:53.647 --> 00:15:57.780
You're not sure if they're just old and have long been dead

422
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.113
or if there's an actual cycle of

423
00:16:02.113 --> 00:16:03.563
weather and nature

424
00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:06.400
that occasionally the storms allow things to grow.

425
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.382
TALIESIN: I feel like I might get a sense.

426
00:16:08.382 --> 00:16:11.425
Can I walk over to one of them and--?

427
00:16:11.425 --> 00:16:13.180
Are you sleeping over there?

428
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.323
Sorry.

429
00:16:14.323 --> 00:16:15.490
You all right?

430
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:17.864
MATT: Make a nature check.

431
00:16:17.864 --> 00:16:18.758
TALIESIN: Thank you.

432
00:16:18.758 --> 00:16:20.641
(laughter)

433
00:16:20.641 --> 00:16:22.342
TRAVIS: I love it.

434
00:16:22.342 --> 00:16:24.371
TALIESIN: Wow, I hope I don't keep rolling like this,

435
00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:26.890
because that's exciting.

436
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:27.723
Where'd it go?

437
00:16:27.723 --> 00:16:30.148
Eight.

438
00:16:30.148 --> 00:16:31.183
TALIESIN: Hard to--

439
00:16:31.183 --> 00:16:32.110
MARISHA: Yeah.

440
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.565
MATT: The tree is barren.

441
00:16:34.565 --> 00:16:35.819
It looks like a tree that exists

442
00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:37.704
in a cold space, unfortunately.

443
00:16:37.704 --> 00:16:38.920
TALIESIN: Yeah.

444
00:16:40.554 --> 00:16:42.752
MICA: Should we peek into the cave

445
00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.778
and see if we see the dragon?

446
00:16:44.778 --> 00:16:46.031
SAM: That's what I was going to ask. I mean,

447
00:16:46.031 --> 00:16:47.564
before we bed down for the night,

448
00:16:47.564 --> 00:16:49.158
should we just at least establish

449
00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:50.898
that this is the correct cave?

450
00:16:50.898 --> 00:16:52.834
MICA: That wasn't my idea. My idea was

451
00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:54.394
if the dragon's far back in the cave,

452
00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:56.946
we can take a corner to ourselves and take a nap.

453
00:16:56.946 --> 00:16:58.374
LAURA: What if he's not far back in the cave--

454
00:16:58.374 --> 00:16:59.966
SAM: What if it's not the right cave?

455
00:16:59.966 --> 00:17:02.139
MICA: Then we run?

456
00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:04.330
MARISHA: Well, let's do a little scouting trip.

457
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.824
A little scouting trip.

458
00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.466
TALIESIN: We have things for this. We have a cat, don't we?

459
00:17:08.466 --> 00:17:09.910
SAM: We have a cat.
LAURA: Yeah.

460
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.666
MARISHA: (as Caleb) Oh, yes. Oh, <i>ja</i>.

461
00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:14.033
I have a cat. Oh <i>scheiße</i>.

462
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.482
TRAVIS: Oh, oh boy.

463
00:17:16.482 --> 00:17:17.919
LAURA: Oh, hello!

464
00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:19.495
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

465
00:17:19.495 --> 00:17:21.109
MICA: What was that accent again?

466
00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.430
TALIESIN: I am so excited.

467
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.694
MARISHA: Okay, I have a cat. Oh <i>ja</i>.

468
00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:28.722
(laughter)

469
00:17:28.722 --> 00:17:31.596
MICA: Matt is horrified.

470
00:17:31.596 --> 00:17:34.730
SAM: Is your cat a cat today, Mr. Caleb?

471
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.746
MARISHA: Oh, <i>ja</i>.

472
00:17:35.746 --> 00:17:37.417
(laughter)

473
00:17:37.417 --> 00:17:40.078
SAM: Only ask him yes or no questions.

474
00:17:40.078 --> 00:17:42.233
MATT: My birthday was two months ago, but--

475
00:17:42.233 --> 00:17:45.060
TALIESIN: Liam, wherever you are, thank you for this gift.

476
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.593
Thank you for this gift, Liam.

477
00:17:46.593 --> 00:17:47.734
TRAVIS: Oh god.

478
00:17:49.426 --> 00:17:54.110
I mean, not only do we need to carefully scout the cave,

479
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.239
but also in case the dragon is in there

480
00:17:56.239 --> 00:18:00.283
and if we agitate it, how the fuck do we get out of here?

481
00:18:00.283 --> 00:18:01.971
We don't really have a quick means of escape.

482
00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:02.804
LAURA: Well--

483
00:18:02.804 --> 00:18:06.083
MARISHA: <i>Ja</i>, I have a Teleportation Circle.

484
00:18:06.083 --> 00:18:09.890
LAURA: You also have the hut that we can be in.

485
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:10.948
TRAVIS: Ah yes.

486
00:18:10.948 --> 00:18:12.136
How long does the hut last?

487
00:18:12.136 --> 00:18:13.014
10 hours?

488
00:18:13.014 --> 00:18:16.689
MATT: Eight hours, as long as he stays within it.

489
00:18:16.689 --> 00:18:17.830
TRAVIS: Right.

490
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.746
TALIESIN: (Percy voice) So we can get ourselves--

491
00:18:19.746 --> 00:18:21.046
(normal voice) wow, you did that to me.

492
00:18:21.046 --> 00:18:22.246
Wow.

493
00:18:22.246 --> 00:18:24.657
Too much accent happening here.

494
00:18:24.657 --> 00:18:27.340
SAM: But Mr. Caleb.

495
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.665
(laughter)

496
00:18:28.665 --> 00:18:33.473
SAM: You know that you can be inside the dome

497
00:18:33.473 --> 00:18:37.712
and controlling the cat at the same time,

498
00:18:37.712 --> 00:18:38.962
isn't that correct?

499
00:18:38.962 --> 00:18:39.894
MARISHA: Oh <i>ja</i>.

500
00:18:39.894 --> 00:18:40.952
SAM: Please elaborate.

501
00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:43.202
(laughter)

502
00:18:44.146 --> 00:18:45.396
TRAVIS: Oh, you know.

503
00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:47.934
LAURA: Oh, well...

504
00:18:47.934 --> 00:18:49.539
SAM: Herdy gerdy gerdy.

505
00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:50.740
(laughter)

506
00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.952
TALIESIN: It's good we're getting the positivity out now

507
00:18:52.952 --> 00:18:56.119
before we're all--
MICA: Before we all die.

508
00:18:57.877 --> 00:19:00.227
MATT: Swedish wizard is my favorite addition to this team.

509
00:19:00.227 --> 00:19:05.002
(laughter)

510
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:10.002
LAURA: Caleb doesn't feel like talking

511
00:19:10.002 --> 00:19:11.506
very much, I can tell.

512
00:19:11.506 --> 00:19:13.279
SAM: I think he's already going in to his trance.

513
00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:15.420
LAURA: You've got a lot of text messages.

514
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.939
TRAVIS: (German accent) Yeah, set up the dome, send cat out.

515
00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:20.324
(laughter)

516
00:19:20.324 --> 00:19:21.447
Jah.

517
00:19:21.447 --> 00:19:22.943
MICA: Jah!
SAM: Jah?

518
00:19:22.943 --> 00:19:25.674
MATT: Yeah, Liam actually-- yeah.

519
00:19:25.674 --> 00:19:28.505
Which is actually German, yeah.

520
00:19:28.505 --> 00:19:29.758
TRAVIS: Pretty sure.

521
00:19:29.758 --> 00:19:32.721
MARISHA: <i>Meine</i> kitty, he go forth.

522
00:19:32.721 --> 00:19:35.023
TRAVIS: (blowing raspberry)
MICA: That got Russian real quick.

523
00:19:35.023 --> 00:19:36.465
MATT: Yeah, it went to cave man.

524
00:19:36.465 --> 00:19:37.754
(laughter)

525
00:19:37.754 --> 00:19:38.824
MATT: Okay, all right.

526
00:19:38.824 --> 00:19:40.994
So are you setting up the--

527
00:19:40.994 --> 00:19:42.932
SAM: Cast the dome?
LAURA: Right, right, right?

528
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.157
MARISHA: Okay, what does it look like?

529
00:19:44.157 --> 00:19:45.323
What does this landscape--

530
00:19:45.323 --> 00:19:46.433
TRAVIS: We should creep closer.

531
00:19:46.433 --> 00:19:48.309
LAURA: We can go up against the rocks that I saw,

532
00:19:48.309 --> 00:19:49.229
the outcropping.

533
00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:51.931
MATT: There is a gradual incline up the side of the

534
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:55.798
mountain. It climbs at places and then levels out a bit

535
00:19:55.798 --> 00:19:57.334
and then climbs more, and the further in you get,

536
00:19:57.334 --> 00:20:00.432
the more the incline of rock begins to raise and raise

537
00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:03.261
to meet the actual heavy mountainside.

538
00:20:03.261 --> 00:20:06.919
You're about 250 feet or so from the entrance

539
00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:10.735
of this cavern, and around you is just

540
00:20:10.735 --> 00:20:14.175
snow and ice and dead trees and rock.

541
00:20:14.175 --> 00:20:16.285
TALIESIN: We don't hear anything. We don't see

542
00:20:16.285 --> 00:20:17.838
any dragons around, there's no--

543
00:20:17.838 --> 00:20:20.330
MATT: Not at the moment, no.
TALIESIN: Okay.

544
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.777
Because if we catch its attention, we're going to be

545
00:20:23.777 --> 00:20:25.027
in some trouble right now.

546
00:20:25.027 --> 00:20:26.547
TRAVIS: Yes, and then we'll be sitting there

547
00:20:26.547 --> 00:20:29.470
for eight hours hoping it goes away.

548
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:30.376
TALIESIN: Which it won't.

549
00:20:30.376 --> 00:20:32.258
MICA: I don't think dragons just disappear.

550
00:20:32.258 --> 00:20:33.772
SAM: You know what we could do.

551
00:20:33.772 --> 00:20:37.053
If I may, we could create the dome,

552
00:20:37.053 --> 00:20:41.237
and by we I mean you, Mr. Caleb, and as soon as it's set up,

553
00:20:41.237 --> 00:20:44.787
I believe it can keep everything out, right?

554
00:20:44.787 --> 00:20:47.832
However, it will also keep snow out,

555
00:20:47.832 --> 00:20:49.807
so if we covered it with snow,

556
00:20:49.807 --> 00:20:51.501
like covered it up with snow, like--

557
00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:52.834
LAURA: It would be really hard to see.

558
00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:55.049
SAM: It would be really hard to see is what I am saying.

559
00:20:55.049 --> 00:20:56.949
MATT: He can also make it look however he wants it to.

560
00:20:56.949 --> 00:20:58.419
LAURA: So he can make it look like snow.

561
00:20:58.419 --> 00:20:59.477
SAM: Could make it look white

562
00:20:59.477 --> 00:21:01.416
and we could also just puff it up a little bit.

563
00:21:01.416 --> 00:21:02.249
TRAVIS: That's not terrible, yeah.

564
00:21:02.249 --> 00:21:03.868
MICA: I can make us a campfire.

565
00:21:03.868 --> 00:21:06.297
TRAVIS: That would be a bad thing, I think.

566
00:21:06.297 --> 00:21:07.793
LAURA: The smoke would come out of it.

567
00:21:07.793 --> 00:21:08.976
TRAVIS: Light and the-- yeah.

568
00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:11.267
TALIESIN: Do we have any supernatural fire, maybe?

569
00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:12.569
MICA: I have supernatural fire.

570
00:21:12.569 --> 00:21:14.071
TALIESIN: Well then, I don't think supernatural fire

571
00:21:14.071 --> 00:21:15.544
makes smoke, if I recall.

572
00:21:15.544 --> 00:21:17.804
TRAVIS: I don't even know what supernatural fire is.

573
00:21:17.804 --> 00:21:20.006
LAURA: It's like Caleb's light balls that he has.

574
00:21:20.006 --> 00:21:23.153
MICA: Does Produce Flame make smoke?

575
00:21:23.153 --> 00:21:24.117
MATT: I'm going to have to turn off my buzzer here

576
00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:27.244
because we're getting a shitton of Liam texts in the thread.

577
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:31.384
SAM: Also, knowing from past experience and text messages,

578
00:21:31.384 --> 00:21:35.054
the hut is actually warm inside.

579
00:21:35.054 --> 00:21:36.197
MARISHA: Quite warm, <i>ja</i>.

580
00:21:36.197 --> 00:21:38.245
TRAVIS: Can control the temperature outside, okay.

581
00:21:38.245 --> 00:21:41.339
SAM: Right, Mr. Caleb?
MARISHA: <i>Ja</i>, it's toasty.

582
00:21:41.339 --> 00:21:43.130
TALIESIN: It's got a Nest.
TRAVIS: Jah.

583
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.034
MARISHA: Jah.
SAM: No, it's <i>ja</i>.

584
00:21:44.034 --> 00:21:45.575
MATT: I would say because it is magically created,

585
00:21:45.575 --> 00:21:46.783
the bonfire would not create smoke.

586
00:21:46.783 --> 00:21:48.036
MICA: Oh, good to know.

587
00:21:48.036 --> 00:21:48.869
MATT: Because why not.

588
00:21:48.869 --> 00:21:51.143
MARISHA: I took German. That's the funny part.

589
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.393
(laughter)

590
00:21:52.393 --> 00:21:53.776
TRAVIS: Damn.

591
00:21:53.776 --> 00:21:55.426
SAM: All right, so we make the dome,

592
00:21:55.426 --> 00:21:58.505
and then once we're all cozy inside,

593
00:21:58.505 --> 00:22:01.449
Frumpkin can go in and peek around.

594
00:22:01.449 --> 00:22:03.836
LAURA: Yeah, or you can do it, because you can be invisible.

595
00:22:03.836 --> 00:22:04.878
SAM: I can.

596
00:22:04.878 --> 00:22:09.228
LAURA: I can also, you know, send messages to the dragon.

597
00:22:09.228 --> 00:22:10.353
SAM: (high-pitched concern) Mmm!

598
00:22:10.353 --> 00:22:13.774
TALIESIN: That seems like a bad idea.

599
00:22:13.774 --> 00:22:15.161
LAURA: Here's the thing, I mean,

600
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:17.934
I can wait to say all this when we're in the hut,

601
00:22:17.934 --> 00:22:20.643
but here's the thing.
TALIESIN: Hmm.

602
00:22:20.643 --> 00:22:22.337
LAURA: It's not like we're going to sneak up

603
00:22:22.337 --> 00:22:23.682
on this dragon, right?

604
00:22:23.682 --> 00:22:26.370
I mean, we're not going to sneak into the thing

605
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.345
and sneakily make him or her

606
00:22:29.345 --> 00:22:32.670
breathe on this thing of metal.

607
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.763
They're going to know we're there,

608
00:22:34.763 --> 00:22:36.652
so might as well talk to them and see if maybe

609
00:22:36.652 --> 00:22:38.549
they'll just breathe on it without fighting us.

610
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:39.734
MICA: They could be nice.

611
00:22:39.734 --> 00:22:41.161
LAURA: They could be a nice dragon.

612
00:22:41.161 --> 00:22:43.774
SAM: I'm okay with that. However, maybe we should

613
00:22:43.774 --> 00:22:45.577
talk with them after we've rested

614
00:22:45.577 --> 00:22:47.997
and have all of our capabilities.

615
00:22:47.997 --> 00:22:50.497
LAURA: No, maybe we should talk with them before,

616
00:22:50.497 --> 00:22:52.499
that way I don't waste my spell.

617
00:22:52.499 --> 00:22:53.909
SAM: I see, I see.

618
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:56.187
TRAVIS: I have a question. Have any of you ever

619
00:22:56.187 --> 00:23:00.380
actually spoken or dealt with a dragon?

620
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.531
MICA: No.
TALIESIN: No.

621
00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:03.061
SAM: Have you?
TRAVIS: No.

622
00:23:03.061 --> 00:23:06.649
MARISHA: (as Beau) Well, we did in a happy fun ball.

623
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:09.387
We actually all did and kind of arrogant.
TRAVIS: Oh, yes!

624
00:23:09.387 --> 00:23:11.198
TALIESIN: But that was--

625
00:23:11.198 --> 00:23:12.076
LAURA: Did you talk to him?

626
00:23:12.076 --> 00:23:15.008
TRAVIS: I did, yes. I did, yes.

627
00:23:15.008 --> 00:23:16.666
Sorry, I repressed that

628
00:23:16.666 --> 00:23:19.034
memory, apparently.
MARISHA: We've been through a lot of shit.

629
00:23:19.034 --> 00:23:20.017
TRAVIS: Wow.
MARISHA: A lot happens

630
00:23:20.017 --> 00:23:21.525
in a day.
TRAVIS: They're very smart and--

631
00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:22.585
MARISHA: You all ever think about that?

632
00:23:22.585 --> 00:23:24.701
Like, are we really living in the moment?

633
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:27.880
Are we processing--
SAM: I don't know, Caleb.

634
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.415
(laughter)
LAURA: No.

635
00:23:29.415 --> 00:23:30.638
SAM: No? Is that Beau?
LAURA: No, that's Beau.

636
00:23:30.638 --> 00:23:32.896
SAM: I can't tell. It's almost the same.

637
00:23:32.896 --> 00:23:35.674
(laughter)

638
00:23:35.674 --> 00:23:37.817
MARISHA: Threw a button at you.

639
00:23:37.817 --> 00:23:40.282
TALIESIN: You can get the doll for a visual aid if you need.

640
00:23:40.282 --> 00:23:41.115
MATT: Oh my god.

641
00:23:41.115 --> 00:23:44.595
MICA: Liam's somewhere in the wilderness like, "Let me in."

642
00:23:44.595 --> 00:23:47.603
TRAVIS: I will say that dragon was very intelligent.

643
00:23:47.603 --> 00:23:51.163
It seemed very clever and dark, and--

644
00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:52.840
MATT: If you want, make an arcana check.

645
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.348
You read a lot on the white dragon, right?

646
00:23:54.348 --> 00:23:55.181
MARISHA: Yeah.

647
00:23:55.181 --> 00:23:56.627
MATT: You actually know that white dragons,

648
00:23:56.627 --> 00:23:58.752
of all the chromatics, are known to be

649
00:23:58.752 --> 00:24:00.258
the least intelligent.

650
00:24:00.258 --> 00:24:03.162
That doesn't mean that they're stupid by any means,

651
00:24:03.162 --> 00:24:08.162
but as far as the scales of the chromatics, they have--

652
00:24:08.604 --> 00:24:11.581
the most intelligent of white dragons

653
00:24:11.581 --> 00:24:16.256
sometimes range the average intelligence of

654
00:24:16.256 --> 00:24:17.706
a person.

655
00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:20.307
MARISHA: Aren't they also the most vengeful or something?

656
00:24:20.307 --> 00:24:22.202
MATT: They're the most feral in some ways.

657
00:24:22.202 --> 00:24:24.993
The most animalistic, hunt, eat.

658
00:24:24.993 --> 00:24:26.886
They're intelligent, you know,

659
00:24:26.886 --> 00:24:28.531
like any intelligent creature is,

660
00:24:28.531 --> 00:24:31.891
but they're not the kind to outsmart

661
00:24:31.891 --> 00:24:33.868
one of wits, necessarily.

662
00:24:33.868 --> 00:24:38.868
LAURA: So maybe we could send in an animal

663
00:24:38.868 --> 00:24:42.383
with the metal strapped to it or something, and then--

664
00:24:42.383 --> 00:24:45.683
TRAVIS: That would be amazing.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, and--

665
00:24:45.683 --> 00:24:46.933
MICA: I have animals.

666
00:24:46.933 --> 00:24:48.638
LAURA: Do you have animals?
MICA: I can make animals.

667
00:24:48.638 --> 00:24:49.922
LAURA: You can also turn into an animal.

668
00:24:49.922 --> 00:24:51.000
MICA: I can also turn into an animal.
LAURA: But I don't want

669
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.301
you to be the one that we try to set on, not fire but ice--

670
00:24:55.301 --> 00:24:58.137
MICA: True, but I can make an animal that we can set on ice.

671
00:24:58.137 --> 00:24:59.335
LAURA and MICA: Yeah!

672
00:24:59.335 --> 00:25:01.584
LAURA: And tie the metal to it, and then the dragon

673
00:25:01.584 --> 00:25:03.246
will just be like, "Oh man, I'm so hungry!"

674
00:25:03.246 --> 00:25:04.559
SAM: "I'm so feral!"

675
00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:07.753
MICA: Wait, but if it's hungry, what if it eats the bar?

676
00:25:07.753 --> 00:25:09.812
MARISHA: That's a good point.
TALIESIN: Very good point.

677
00:25:09.812 --> 00:25:12.160
MARISHA: We need to agitate it. We need--

678
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.503
LAURA: We need a fast animal that just runs around.

679
00:25:14.503 --> 00:25:15.959
MICA: What if it's like a cheetah?

680
00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:17.370
Cheetahs would die in the snow.

681
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.969
What if it's like a snow leopard?

682
00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:20.976
SAM: A snow leopard.
LAURA: (gasps)

683
00:25:20.976 --> 00:25:23.265
SAM: But then, if the dragon kills it,

684
00:25:23.265 --> 00:25:24.859
we still have the problem of a big dragon

685
00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:26.832
going and eating its body or something.

686
00:25:26.832 --> 00:25:30.282
TRAVIS: Or taking the ore, I mean, it's a shiny metal.

687
00:25:30.282 --> 00:25:31.697
Don't dragons like--

688
00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:34.060
SAM: We could attach the piece of metal to a rope,

689
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.167
so if the snow cheetah dies--

690
00:25:37.167 --> 00:25:39.704
TALIESIN: I thought about that, I thought about that.

691
00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.243
The rope might burn.

692
00:25:41.243 --> 00:25:45.325
LAURA: What if we--
TALIESIN: I did think about that.

693
00:25:45.325 --> 00:25:47.279
LAURA: Okay wait, what if we put the metal

694
00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:49.444
in the snow leopard's mouth.
MICA: Uh-huh.

695
00:25:49.444 --> 00:25:52.087
LAURA: It runs, it gets sprayed on, everything like that.

696
00:25:52.087 --> 00:25:53.293
The snow leopard dies.

697
00:25:53.293 --> 00:25:57.710
He's about to get eaten, and then you send in your Mage Hand

698
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.260
and you snatch up the ingot out of the dragon's mouth

699
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.278
before it ever gets to eat it,

700
00:26:03.278 --> 00:26:05.140
and then you bring it back into the hut,

701
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.883
and then we're all safe and then Caleb,

702
00:26:06.883 --> 00:26:08.801
you can do teleportation, then we're gone--

703
00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:11.621
TRAVIS: How far away do you need to be for your hand?

704
00:26:11.621 --> 00:26:13.375
SAM: I think it's about 60 feet.

705
00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:15.808
TALIESIN: I'll also say that we do have a little

706
00:26:15.808 --> 00:26:19.826
talky button that we could attach to--
SAM: Oh, 30 feet.

707
00:26:19.826 --> 00:26:22.464
LAURA: To the snow leopard
MICA: And the snow leopard

708
00:26:22.464 --> 00:26:25.680
could send a message that says, "We're friends. Hi!"

709
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.250
TALIESIN: Do we now have a talking snow leopard?

710
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.427
LAURA: Might as well.

711
00:26:28.427 --> 00:26:29.911
TRAVIS: Another thing to keep in mind,

712
00:26:29.911 --> 00:26:33.120
with all this drawing things out of the cave,

713
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.905
look around our feet. Are we leaving prints

714
00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:38.046
in the snow, tracks?

715
00:26:38.046 --> 00:26:40.116
MATT: Where you're standing right now, yes, very much so.

716
00:26:40.116 --> 00:26:44.503
TRAVIS: So if we go in and flee or throw something in

717
00:26:44.503 --> 00:26:47.893
and retract it, it will lead a straight line directly to--

718
00:26:47.893 --> 00:26:50.000
LAURA: Yeah, but we have the hut.

719
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.058
TRAVIS: Yeah, the dome.

720
00:26:51.058 --> 00:26:53.150
LAURA: Right, and then we do the Teleportation Circle

721
00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:57.763
within the dome, and then we just bamf out from the dome.

722
00:26:57.763 --> 00:26:59.205
TRAVIS: That sounds like it could work.

723
00:26:59.205 --> 00:27:01.901
TALIESIN: Don't know if that can, does that work?

724
00:27:01.901 --> 00:27:04.663
MICA: Or I can send in a snow leopard,

725
00:27:04.663 --> 00:27:07.443
and then I turn into a giant spider,

726
00:27:07.443 --> 00:27:08.966
and then I send out a spider web,

727
00:27:08.966 --> 00:27:11.685
and then pull on the spider web, and then we run away.

728
00:27:11.685 --> 00:27:13.769
MARISHA: Yeah, there's also no guarantee

729
00:27:13.769 --> 00:27:17.171
that one hit of ice breath on this thing is going to cut it.

730
00:27:17.171 --> 00:27:18.884
This might take a few rounds.

731
00:27:18.884 --> 00:27:19.941
SAM: On the metal, you mean?

732
00:27:19.941 --> 00:27:20.866
MARISHA: Yeah.

733
00:27:20.866 --> 00:27:23.681
SAM: Because they said it had to change color.

734
00:27:23.681 --> 00:27:25.712
TRAVIS: It has to glow blue, right?
LAURA: Yeah.

735
00:27:25.712 --> 00:27:27.829
TALIESIN: I feel like we have two approaches that we can

736
00:27:27.829 --> 00:27:30.503
take here, which is we can either try and

737
00:27:30.503 --> 00:27:33.253
reason with this dragon

738
00:27:33.253 --> 00:27:34.910
and try and--
MICA: Or we kill it.

739
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.362
TALIESIN: Well--
LAURA: Or we just try to trick it.

740
00:27:37.362 --> 00:27:39.628
TALIESIN: Or we try and trick it, which may lead to killing.

741
00:27:39.628 --> 00:27:42.632
MARISHA: I would just like to point out that its name

742
00:27:42.632 --> 00:27:44.799
is the Nightmare in Ivory.

743
00:27:45.925 --> 00:27:49.656
It sounds look a woman scorned on her wedding day,

744
00:27:49.656 --> 00:27:50.938
I don't know--
LAURA: Maybe it is.

745
00:27:50.938 --> 00:27:52.286
TALIESIN: Or a good electronica band.

746
00:27:52.286 --> 00:27:55.556
MICA: So somebody has to marry it, problem solved.

747
00:27:55.556 --> 00:27:57.379
LAURA: Fjord, you're very attractive.

748
00:27:57.379 --> 00:27:58.503
MARISHA: You are very attractive.

749
00:27:58.503 --> 00:27:59.833
TRAVIS: I don't want to marry a dragon.
MARISHA: Honestly, a

750
00:27:59.833 --> 00:28:01.598
proposal might soften--

751
00:28:01.598 --> 00:28:04.331
MICA: Does anybody have a ring?

752
00:28:05.263 --> 00:28:07.379
LAURA: I have lots of rings on my fingers.

753
00:28:07.379 --> 00:28:08.751
SAM: I think it's Liam.

754
00:28:08.751 --> 00:28:10.442
MICA: Problem solved.

755
00:28:10.442 --> 00:28:12.627
TALIESIN: But no, this is, I mean--

756
00:28:12.627 --> 00:28:15.444
TRAVIS: An important question for Caleb is can the dome

757
00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:19.393
be up and then can he also conjure, draw, whatever

758
00:28:19.393 --> 00:28:21.180
the transportation--
LAURA: Teleportation Circle.

759
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.488
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one, circle.

760
00:28:22.488 --> 00:28:25.109
MARISHA: (as Caleb) I'm pretty sure, <i>ja</i>.

761
00:28:25.109 --> 00:28:28.567
If I, ooh, awkward.

762
00:28:28.567 --> 00:28:30.516
(laughter)
MICA: Can she hear us?

763
00:28:30.516 --> 00:28:32.072
SAM: Scratch your arm, scratch your arm.

764
00:28:32.072 --> 00:28:33.786
TALIESIN: Yes, he can.

765
00:28:33.786 --> 00:28:36.450
MATT: I didn't realize he was even gone for a second.

766
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:41.304
MARISHA: 'Cause, you know,
dome is a concentration spell, <i>ja</i>,

767
00:28:41.304 --> 00:28:42.337
and I can have one of those

768
00:28:42.337 --> 00:28:44.615
up at a time, <i>ja</i>.
MATT: Well, the dome is not concentration.

769
00:28:44.615 --> 00:28:45.448
MARISHA: (normal voice) Oh, it's not.

770
00:28:45.448 --> 00:28:46.956
MATT: No, it just lasts for eight hours.

771
00:28:46.956 --> 00:28:48.007
MARISHA: So I can do it, can we--

772
00:28:48.007 --> 00:28:49.329
MATT: Neither of them are concentration,

773
00:28:49.329 --> 00:28:52.041
but each take a minute to cast.

774
00:28:52.041 --> 00:28:53.295
MARISHA: The Teleportation Circle as well?

775
00:28:53.295 --> 00:28:54.128
MATT: Yes.

776
00:28:54.128 --> 00:28:55.111
LAURA: But that's fine.

777
00:28:55.111 --> 00:28:56.820
If we're inside the dome then the dragon

778
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.707
can't get in the dome, and then you can draw

779
00:28:58.707 --> 00:28:59.873
at your leisure.

780
00:28:59.873 --> 00:29:02.614
TALIESIN: That also means that any contact we have

781
00:29:02.614 --> 00:29:05.065
with the dragon will be no Caleb.

782
00:29:05.065 --> 00:29:07.450
LAURA: Here's a question.
TRAVIS: Yep.

783
00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:12.009
LAURA: If I use Dimension Door and I do pop over,

784
00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:15.310
then would I be able to pop into the dome,

785
00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.763
or would I have to pop, just probably next to it--

786
00:29:17.763 --> 00:29:20.284
TRAVIS: You are allowed to. You're welcome in the dome.

787
00:29:20.284 --> 00:29:22.012
He decides who comes in and out.

788
00:29:22.012 --> 00:29:24.279
MARISHA: Is it considered on the same plane of existence?

789
00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:26.345
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

790
00:29:26.345 --> 00:29:27.710
MARISHA: Then yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

791
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.300
TRAVIS: So I think we have a good exit plan.

792
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.520
We should get closer and see what we'll be informed by--

793
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.736
SAM: It seems like, talking it through with these animals

794
00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:40.174
and the mage hands and everything,

795
00:29:40.174 --> 00:29:42.122
it seems like some of us are going to

796
00:29:42.122 --> 00:29:44.825
have to get close to do this.

797
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:47.052
MICA: What if we go in and the dragon's like an old man

798
00:29:47.052 --> 00:29:49.168
and we can just slit its throat and leave?

799
00:29:49.168 --> 00:29:52.632
MARISHA: The older they get, the worse they get.

800
00:29:52.632 --> 00:29:54.519
TALIESIN: It would be called like the Nap in Ivory

801
00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:55.711
if it was that old--

802
00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:58.152
MICA: Maybe he hasn't had his name updated. We don't know!

803
00:29:58.152 --> 00:30:01.144
SAM: Also, regarding killing, I don't think the dragon

804
00:30:01.144 --> 00:30:03.230
can breathe once it's dead, so that will have

805
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.257
foiled our plans.
LAURA: This is true.

806
00:30:06.257 --> 00:30:07.090
MICA: Hmm.

807
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.472
LAURA: I think we go in, we get the breath,

808
00:30:09.472 --> 00:30:11.188
it turns blue, and we leave.

809
00:30:11.188 --> 00:30:12.873
I don't think we should try to kill it

810
00:30:12.873 --> 00:30:15.193
because it's going to be very strong.

811
00:30:15.193 --> 00:30:16.122
TRAVIS: I agree.

812
00:30:16.122 --> 00:30:18.085
LAURA: And that blue dragon was really little.

813
00:30:18.085 --> 00:30:20.523
I mean, he was kind of a baby,

814
00:30:20.523 --> 00:30:23.405
and he was really hard to kill.

815
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:25.380
SAM: I've got a pitch, I've got a pitch.

816
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.965
It's not a good pitch.
TRAVIS: Let's hear it.

817
00:30:26.965 --> 00:30:29.366
We're excited to hear it.

818
00:30:29.366 --> 00:30:31.896
SAM: It's a really bad pitch. (laughs)

819
00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:33.872
What if we all go in together,

820
00:30:33.872 --> 00:30:35.269
because we're better as a team.

821
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:36.176
TRAVIS: Yep.
TALIESIN: Sure.

822
00:30:36.176 --> 00:30:39.796
SAM: We have some fast folks among us.

823
00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:42.719
Namely you, Beauregard.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

824
00:30:42.719 --> 00:30:44.816
SAM: Also you can bamf around

825
00:30:44.816 --> 00:30:46.678
with your Dimension Door a little bit.

826
00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:47.578
LAURA: A couple of times.

827
00:30:47.578 --> 00:30:50.564
SAM: Yeah, so what if we spread out as much as we can.

828
00:30:50.564 --> 00:30:52.425
We'll obviously have to see what the inside

829
00:30:52.425 --> 00:30:54.671
of this cave is like, but if we spread out a lot

830
00:30:54.671 --> 00:30:56.418
and sort of do like a hot potato thing

831
00:30:56.418 --> 00:30:59.993
with the mithral, right?

832
00:30:59.993 --> 00:31:02.860
That way, even if it blasts one of us,

833
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.744
maybe we won't die, and then we can just

834
00:31:05.744 --> 00:31:08.292
hot potato it somewhere else, and then

835
00:31:08.292 --> 00:31:11.159
the dragon will shoot that person,

836
00:31:11.159 --> 00:31:13.360
and that person won't die either, maybe.

837
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.629
MARISHA: You know, I'm actually down for this

838
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:16.770
on a conceptual level.

839
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.987
I hear your pitch, and I'm going to, yeah.

840
00:31:19.987 --> 00:31:22.448
I think we can start with some of the illusion stuff,

841
00:31:22.448 --> 00:31:26.464
but eventually, if that this piece of hunk of metal

842
00:31:26.464 --> 00:31:29.070
gets stuck, someone's going to have to run and get it,

843
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.279
and then I think the baton pass-off

844
00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:33.830
is actually not a bad call.

845
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.409
LAURA: But, okay.
TALIESIN: Once it's blue.

846
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:38.392
LAURA: What, if though,

847
00:31:38.392 --> 00:31:42.650
one hit from his breath does kill us?

848
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.704
SAM: Well then, we'll find that out very quickly.

849
00:31:44.704 --> 00:31:48.075
I was going to suggest that maybe Reani could go first.

850
00:31:48.075 --> 00:31:49.764
MICA: I can go first.

851
00:31:49.764 --> 00:31:52.535
TRAVIS: Let's just get--
SAM: I'm sorry--

852
00:31:52.535 --> 00:31:54.776
TRAVIS: How about we just get closer and we actually

853
00:31:54.776 --> 00:31:56.995
take a look, yes?

854
00:31:56.995 --> 00:31:58.370
LAURA: Frumpkin?

855
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.221
Will you go?
MARISHA: (meows)

856
00:32:02.221 --> 00:32:04.240
LAURA: Caleb, will you send Frumpkin in?

857
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.981
TRAVIS: We should go around the side, set up the dome,

858
00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:10.235
and then send in Frumpkin, yes?

859
00:32:10.235 --> 00:32:12.292
LAURA: Set up the dome.
SAM: Yes, yes, yes.

860
00:32:12.292 --> 00:32:14.498
LAURA: Caleb, can you cast the dome twice in one day?

861
00:32:14.498 --> 00:32:15.814
If we set it up now, will you also be able

862
00:32:15.814 --> 00:32:17.939
to set it up so we can--

863
00:32:17.939 --> 00:32:22.079
MARISHA: (as Caleb) <i>Ja</i>, as long as I sleep.

864
00:32:22.079 --> 00:32:23.643
MATT: It's a 3rd-level spell, so it can be cast

865
00:32:23.643 --> 00:32:25.111
multiple times a day.

866
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:25.986
MARISHA: (as Beau) Okay, well yeah,

867
00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:27.544
but we're going to sleep though, right?

868
00:32:27.544 --> 00:32:28.377
We're going to sleep?

869
00:32:28.377 --> 00:32:29.758
TRAVIS: Let's go check it out.
MARISHA: All right.

870
00:32:29.758 --> 00:32:31.598
TRAVIS: We move closer.

871
00:32:31.598 --> 00:32:33.801
On a flank.
LAURA: Quietly, quietly, quietly.

872
00:32:33.801 --> 00:32:35.598
I cast Pass Without a Trace.

873
00:32:35.598 --> 00:32:36.852
MATT: All right, you cast Pass Without a Trace.

874
00:32:36.852 --> 00:32:38.529
Everybody go ahead and roll stealth checks, please.

875
00:32:38.529 --> 00:32:40.147
TALIESIN: (groans)
MARISHA: Oh god.

876
00:32:40.147 --> 00:32:43.137
TALIESIN: Oh god, which one am I going to use?

877
00:32:43.137 --> 00:32:44.878
MICA: Oh, thank goodness.

878
00:32:46.117 --> 00:32:48.114
TALIESIN: Hey!
MICA: 17?

879
00:32:48.114 --> 00:32:50.540
MATT: Plus 10 with Pass Without a Trace.

880
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.137
MICA: 27.
MATT: Nice.

881
00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:53.532
TALIESIN: 27.
MATT: All righty.

882
00:32:53.532 --> 00:32:55.773
MICA: Aww yeah.
MATT: Nature bros.

883
00:32:55.773 --> 00:32:57.429
LAURA: I rolled this thing, but I don't know

884
00:32:57.429 --> 00:32:59.732
how to tell what number it landed on?

885
00:32:59.732 --> 00:33:02.594
SAM: I think it's a nine.
TALIESIN: It's a nine.

886
00:33:02.594 --> 00:33:04.104
LAURA: How do you know that?

887
00:33:04.104 --> 00:33:05.340
MATT: You rolled a satellite.

888
00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.810
TRAVIS: What is that? Is that a UFO?

889
00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.976
LAURA: It's supposed to be a shield.

890
00:33:07.976 --> 00:33:09.495
I feel like I should a roll different dice,

891
00:33:09.495 --> 00:33:11.629
just because I don't know what it actually says.

892
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:12.968
MATT: Then go for it.

893
00:33:12.968 --> 00:33:15.201
MARISHA: (laughs)

894
00:33:16.087 --> 00:33:18.504
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Well, that's a thing.

895
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.858
LAURA: 33.

896
00:33:20.858 --> 00:33:22.009
MATT: Okay.

897
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:24.115
SAM: 43.

898
00:33:24.115 --> 00:33:25.025
MARISHA: 31.

899
00:33:25.025 --> 00:33:27.506
MATT: And that was for Beau, for Caleb?

900
00:33:27.506 --> 00:33:29.701
SAM: Oh wait, we don't have Pass-- we do have--

901
00:33:29.701 --> 00:33:31.850
LAURA: We do have Pass Without a Trace.
SAM: 43, yeah.

902
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.633
LAURA: You added ten?
MICA: Yes.

903
00:33:34.943 --> 00:33:35.843
MARISHA: 28.

904
00:33:35.843 --> 00:33:36.858
TRAVIS: 15.

905
00:33:36.858 --> 00:33:38.118
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Sorry.

906
00:33:38.118 --> 00:33:40.924
MATT: You guys, trudging through the snow,

907
00:33:40.924 --> 00:33:42.595
making your way up the side of this mountain.

908
00:33:42.595 --> 00:33:43.857
Are you going towards the right

909
00:33:43.857 --> 00:33:45.186
or the left side of the cavern entrance?

910
00:33:45.186 --> 00:33:46.827
TRAVIS: I like left.

911
00:33:46.827 --> 00:33:51.180
LAURA: Is there one that has more of a flat area next to it?

912
00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.030
MATT: Between the two of them, the side of the mountain

913
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.663
tends to be pretty similar. There's some variations,

914
00:33:55.663 --> 00:33:58.038
but it doesn't seem to be a difference one way or the other.

915
00:33:58.038 --> 00:34:00.284
LAURA: There's no plateaus on either side?

916
00:34:00.284 --> 00:34:02.356
MATT: Slight plateau on both sides.

917
00:34:02.356 --> 00:34:04.425
LAURA: Okay, then the left.

918
00:34:04.425 --> 00:34:05.287
MATT: Okay.

919
00:34:05.287 --> 00:34:09.221
You guys curve to the left, make your way to the side,

920
00:34:09.221 --> 00:34:14.212
unnoticed, no other scenario, no issues.

921
00:34:15.285 --> 00:34:17.615
TRAVIS: Do we hear anything being closer?

922
00:34:17.615 --> 00:34:20.672
MATT: Make a perception check.

923
00:34:20.672 --> 00:34:21.650
TRAVIS: Natural one.

924
00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.696
(laughter)

925
00:34:22.696 --> 00:34:25.304
SAM: I'm going to sniff the air.

926
00:34:25.304 --> 00:34:26.814
MATT: Make a perception check.

927
00:34:26.814 --> 00:34:28.147
SAM: 17.

928
00:34:28.147 --> 00:34:29.372
MATT: 17.

929
00:34:31.457 --> 00:34:33.755
It's a very, very clean smell,

930
00:34:33.755 --> 00:34:35.890
with the ice and the wind cutting through,

931
00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:37.145
and the smell has been very familiar to you.

932
00:34:37.145 --> 00:34:40.069
You do catch a slight whiff of something on the wind

933
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:42.167
that is different from everything else.

934
00:34:42.167 --> 00:34:44.681
It's somewhat pungent. It's very faint

935
00:34:44.681 --> 00:34:47.603
and only comes a little bit here and there.

936
00:34:47.603 --> 00:34:50.761
It's almost like wet dog.

937
00:34:50.761 --> 00:34:52.518
MICA: As we get closer to the cave,

938
00:34:52.518 --> 00:34:53.993
can I see inside of it yet?

939
00:34:53.993 --> 00:34:55.616
MATT: You guys are moving on the left side of it.

940
00:34:55.616 --> 00:34:56.634
Do you want to head towards the front of the cave?

941
00:34:56.634 --> 00:34:58.450
MARISHA: Yetis.

942
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.188
LAURA: (gasps)

943
00:35:00.188 --> 00:35:01.589
MARISHA: They mentioned yetis.

944
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:02.422
TRAVIS: They did.

945
00:35:02.422 --> 00:35:03.753
They have hair.
TALIESIN: Let's stay as a group.

946
00:35:03.753 --> 00:35:05.077
MICA: Yeah, let's stay as a group.

947
00:35:05.077 --> 00:35:07.359
TRAVIS: You need to cast that fucking dome.

948
00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:10.458
MICA: Can we make our campsite now?

949
00:35:10.458 --> 00:35:11.462
SAM: Mm-hmm.

950
00:35:11.462 --> 00:35:12.512
MARISHA: (as Caleb) Oof. I, uh--

951
00:35:12.512 --> 00:35:14.643
SAM: You can do it right at the mouth of the cave, or--

952
00:35:14.643 --> 00:35:16.895
TALIESIN: Just right off to the side.

953
00:35:16.895 --> 00:35:17.858
MARISHA: <i>Ja, ja, ja, ja.</i>

954
00:35:17.858 --> 00:35:18.691
MATT: Okay.

955
00:35:18.691 --> 00:35:20.150
(laughter)

956
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.592
All right.

957
00:35:21.592 --> 00:35:24.393
SAM: We need a counter for how many times she says "ja."

958
00:35:24.393 --> 00:35:26.080
TRAVIS: CritRoleStats is on the job.

959
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.599
(laughter)

960
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.201
MARISHA: You don't want to give them the task,

961
00:35:29.201 --> 00:35:30.226
that's a fool's errand.

962
00:35:30.226 --> 00:35:32.097
MICA: Everybody just sighed.

963
00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:33.420
MATT: Yeah.

964
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.003
TALIESIN: This is just making my miss my lederhosen.

965
00:35:37.003 --> 00:35:40.179
MARISHA: I pull out my pocket kitchen sink

966
00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:44.075
and my air mattress and

967
00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:48.481
I take 60 seconds to set up.

968
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:50.491
SAM: I love how he always describes

969
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:53.469
the magical process with such vivid detail.

970
00:35:53.469 --> 00:35:55.487
MATT: So the small crystal bead that is the required

971
00:35:55.487 --> 00:35:59.489
material component for the spell is produced.

972
00:35:59.489 --> 00:36:02.815
A brief moment of concentration and uttering of incantations

973
00:36:02.815 --> 00:36:07.244
before everyone surrounding Caleb, you're completely wrapped

974
00:36:07.244 --> 00:36:09.426
in a semi-transparent dome.

975
00:36:09.426 --> 00:36:11.066
MARISHA: I make it white.

976
00:36:11.066 --> 00:36:12.405
MATT: Right.

977
00:36:12.405 --> 00:36:14.466
So it has a textured exterior,

978
00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:16.232
where it looks like a pile of snow

979
00:36:16.232 --> 00:36:17.520
against the side of the cavern

980
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.303
from the outside. From the inside, it looks

981
00:36:19.303 --> 00:36:21.779
like a slightly shaded glass.

982
00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:23.021
LAURA: Ooh, cool.

983
00:36:23.021 --> 00:36:24.804
MATT: It's warm on the inside. The freezing temperature

984
00:36:24.804 --> 00:36:26.275
is causing you to chatter your teeth

985
00:36:26.275 --> 00:36:28.842
and keep your legs and body muscles moving,

986
00:36:28.842 --> 00:36:30.106
suddenly becomes comfortable.

987
00:36:30.106 --> 00:36:34.474
LAURA: ♪ Rod of warmth, if anybody needs some help here ♪

988
00:36:34.474 --> 00:36:36.670
TRAVIS: It's warm in the hut.

989
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.670
LAURA: Yeah, but it takes a minute for your body

990
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.433
to warm up.
MARISHA: It feels good.

991
00:36:40.433 --> 00:36:43.409
MICA: I also want to cast Produce Flame

992
00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:46.643
and just pass it around, just to warm people up.

993
00:36:46.643 --> 00:36:48.248
MATT: Reani comes around and warms each person

994
00:36:48.248 --> 00:36:51.079
individually with this roaring, crackling fire

995
00:36:51.079 --> 00:36:52.953
in the middle of the, yeah, exactly.

996
00:36:52.953 --> 00:36:54.098
MICA: Anybody, anybody?

997
00:36:54.098 --> 00:36:57.055
SAM: I've a little old bacon that I'll hold up and--

998
00:36:57.055 --> 00:36:58.938
MICA: Just toast it.

999
00:36:58.938 --> 00:37:00.909
(laughter)

1000
00:37:00.909 --> 00:37:01.939
LAURA: What are we doing?

1001
00:37:01.939 --> 00:37:06.344
MARISHA: Should I send out my kitty cat?

1002
00:37:06.344 --> 00:37:08.241
MICA: There's a kitty cat?

1003
00:37:08.241 --> 00:37:10.219
MARISHA: Oh, <i>ja.</i>

1004
00:37:10.219 --> 00:37:11.099
Boof.

1005
00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:14.421
MATT: You watch this fey cat apparate.

1006
00:37:14.421 --> 00:37:17.059
Orange in color with slight stripes across the fur.

1007
00:37:17.059 --> 00:37:20.327
(meows)
MICA: I'm going to gently pet him.

1008
00:37:20.327 --> 00:37:22.533
MATT: (purring)
MICA: (gasps)

1009
00:37:22.533 --> 00:37:23.610
MATT: Leans up against.

1010
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.898
MICA: (gasps)

1011
00:37:24.898 --> 00:37:27.481
This is the greatest day.

1012
00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:29.108
MARISHA: He likes you.

1013
00:37:29.108 --> 00:37:30.257
(laughter)

1014
00:37:30.257 --> 00:37:33.192
MATT: She's getting there, she's getting there, yeah.

1015
00:37:33.192 --> 00:37:35.952
MICA: A single tear rolls down my face.

1016
00:37:35.952 --> 00:37:37.455
TALIESIN: She's beginning to see.

1017
00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.653
(laughter)

1018
00:37:39.653 --> 00:37:41.116
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: She's starting to believe.

1019
00:37:41.116 --> 00:37:42.271
(laughter)

1020
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:46.438
MARISHA: Every actor needs a warmup process, okay?

1021
00:37:46.438 --> 00:37:47.796
TALIESIN: Yours is a muppet.

1022
00:37:47.796 --> 00:37:50.477
SAM: Don't forget, Caleb, when you're looking

1023
00:37:50.477 --> 00:37:53.656
through Frumpkin's eyes, lean on Beauregard.

1024
00:37:53.656 --> 00:37:55.305
(laughter)

1025
00:37:55.305 --> 00:37:56.709
Put your hand on her shoulder.

1026
00:37:56.709 --> 00:37:58.109
MARISHA: I always do.

1027
00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:00.359
(laughter)

1028
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:04.363
TALIESIN: Do we have a Frumpkin?

1029
00:38:04.363 --> 00:38:06.346
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bless on Frumpkin.

1030
00:38:06.346 --> 00:38:07.179
Will that work?

1031
00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:08.012
MATT: Yeah, it will.

1032
00:38:08.012 --> 00:38:10.829
TALIESIN: I'm casting Bless on Frumpkin, Caleb, and Nott.

1033
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:13.230
MATT: So for one minute, I believe is the--

1034
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.929
the length of time?
TALIESIN: Looking for that.

1035
00:38:14.929 --> 00:38:16.735
One minute.
MATT: Yes.

1036
00:38:16.735 --> 00:38:17.725
Frumpkin is blessed.

1037
00:38:17.725 --> 00:38:21.202
So Frumpkin manages to curl away from your grasp

1038
00:38:21.202 --> 00:38:24.371
after the spell apparates around him,

1039
00:38:24.371 --> 00:38:26.532
giving this like, slight, warm glow,

1040
00:38:26.532 --> 00:38:28.699
and Frumpkin is going to delve out into the snow.

1041
00:38:28.699 --> 00:38:30.290
Make a stealth check for Frumpkin.

1042
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:31.790
MARISHA: Does he have Pass Without a Trace?

1043
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.139
MATT: He won't once he leaves the radius of Jester.

1044
00:38:34.139 --> 00:38:36.032
MARISHA: Poop.

1045
00:38:36.032 --> 00:38:37.672
MATT: You get to add a d4 to it.

1046
00:38:37.672 --> 00:38:39.866
TALIESIN: No, it's not a save or an attack.

1047
00:38:39.866 --> 00:38:41.093
MATT: Oh, right, it's not an ability check.

1048
00:38:41.093 --> 00:38:43.476
So yeah, just a straight roll plus Frumpkin's--

1049
00:38:43.476 --> 00:38:45.224
TALIESIN: Darn it.

1050
00:38:45.224 --> 00:38:47.161
MARISHA: Frumpkin's stats, did he give me Frumpkin's stats?

1051
00:38:47.161 --> 00:38:49.627
MATT: Here, I got a Monster Manual right here.

1052
00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:52.521
MARISHA: Cats. It's just a cat, fey cat?

1053
00:38:52.521 --> 00:38:54.429
MATT: Just a cat.
MARISHA: Cat.

1054
00:38:54.429 --> 00:38:57.013
MATT: Dexterity bonus for stealth is plus four.

1055
00:38:57.013 --> 00:38:58.179
MARISHA: Six.

1056
00:38:58.179 --> 00:38:59.886
MATT: Okay.

1057
00:38:59.886 --> 00:39:02.319
So looking through Frumpkin's eyes, Frumpkin--

1058
00:39:02.319 --> 00:39:03.202
MARISHA: It's Frumpkin's roll, not mine.

1059
00:39:03.202 --> 00:39:04.231
I had nothing to do with it.

1060
00:39:04.231 --> 00:39:05.072
MATT: Exactly.

1061
00:39:05.072 --> 00:39:07.245
TALIESIN: Cat in snow is adorable, though.

1062
00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:11.370
MATT: Yep. Keeping really low and leaping,

1063
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:12.933
like disappearing into each cluster,

1064
00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:15.878
coming around the circle to the front of the cavern.

1065
00:39:15.878 --> 00:39:19.186
You can see the ice that is gathered around the edges

1066
00:39:19.186 --> 00:39:21.690
and how it spindles out.

1067
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.507
MARISHA: I describe all of this to Beauregard.

1068
00:39:24.507 --> 00:39:26.609
MATT: All right.

1069
00:39:26.609 --> 00:39:28.366
MARISHA: And everybody else.

1070
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:30.277
MATT: All right.

1071
00:39:30.277 --> 00:39:34.628
Go ahead and make a perception check with Frumpkin, please.

1072
00:39:34.628 --> 00:39:36.205
So roll again.

1073
00:39:37.122 --> 00:39:39.450
There is no light in there.
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

1074
00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:42.447
LAURA: That's okay, Caleb always
rolls shittily for Frumpkin.

1075
00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:43.297
MATT: It's true.

1076
00:39:43.297 --> 00:39:46.065
TALIESIN: Perfect Liam simulator so far.

1077
00:39:46.065 --> 00:39:47.180
MATT: Add a plus three to your roll.

1078
00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.938
It has disadvantage, because it is dark inside.

1079
00:39:48.938 --> 00:39:49.771
LAURA: Oh.

1080
00:39:52.524 --> 00:39:54.299
MARISHA: Seven.
MATT: Okay.

1081
00:39:56.018 --> 00:40:00.976
Frumpkin glances in, looks in the darkness.

1082
00:40:02.375 --> 00:40:04.325
Doesn't see much on the inside.

1083
00:40:04.325 --> 00:40:06.235
What little bit of daylight's coming in

1084
00:40:06.235 --> 00:40:08.683
is scattering across the bits of ice and snow

1085
00:40:08.683 --> 00:40:11.270
that's blowing into the main entrance.

1086
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:14.975
Frumpkin enters slightly and looks around the corner.

1087
00:40:14.975 --> 00:40:19.750
You just hear (growling)

1088
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.958
and Frumpkin turns around to run

1089
00:40:21.958 --> 00:40:25.436
as a big, furry hand grabs Frumpkin

1090
00:40:25.436 --> 00:40:28.189
and Frumpkin just warps out of its hands.

1091
00:40:28.189 --> 00:40:29.400
MARISHA: I do that thing.
MATT: Yes.

1092
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.724
MARISHA: Okay.

1093
00:40:31.724 --> 00:40:36.224
TRAVIS: What did it see before it bamfed the fuck out?

1094
00:40:36.224 --> 00:40:38.036
Big furry hand?

1095
00:40:38.036 --> 00:40:40.688
MARISHA: It was the dragon.

1096
00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:43.480
TRAVIS: Was it?
MICA: Are dragons furry?

1097
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.589
TRAVIS: What color was the hand?

1098
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:46.951
MARISHA: Right, was it? You said it was furry?

1099
00:40:46.951 --> 00:40:49.291
MATT: It looked like a humanoid hand,

1100
00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:51.290
but with a bunch of fur on the back of it.

1101
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:55.623
MARISHA: Ah, sorry, it's really dark in there.

1102
00:40:55.623 --> 00:40:57.259
It's got to be a yeti, right?

1103
00:40:57.259 --> 00:40:58.100
SAM: I don't know.

1104
00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.050
TALIESIN: What's a yeti?

1105
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:02.396
LAURA: Why would a yeti be living in there with the dragon?

1106
00:41:02.396 --> 00:41:04.333
MICA: Are they friends?
SAM: This is not the dragon's cave.

1107
00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:06.295
Maybe this is a yeti cave.

1108
00:41:06.295 --> 00:41:07.931
We have no idea!
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1109
00:41:07.931 --> 00:41:10.368
MICA: Question, can we kill a yeti?

1110
00:41:10.368 --> 00:41:11.862
LAURA: I don't know.
MICA: Please?

1111
00:41:11.862 --> 00:41:12.835
LAURA: I don't know what a yeti--

1112
00:41:12.835 --> 00:41:16.171
TRAVIS: Do you have a desire to kill a yeti in particular?

1113
00:41:16.171 --> 00:41:18.823
LAURA: Should I send a message to the yeti?

1114
00:41:18.823 --> 00:41:20.518
SAM: I don't think, can they speak?

1115
00:41:20.518 --> 00:41:22.685
LAURA: I don't know!

1116
00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:26.777
MARISHA: I just got fuzzy claw.

1117
00:41:26.777 --> 00:41:28.177
MATT: Yeah, because Frumpkin began to turn around

1118
00:41:28.177 --> 00:41:31.208
after hearing the sound and just, the hand reached out,

1119
00:41:31.208 --> 00:41:33.218
grabbed, and as soon as it did, you bamfed it out, so.

1120
00:41:33.218 --> 00:41:34.458
TRAVIS: That complicates things.

1121
00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:37.742
One dragon is one thing. Dragon and several other occupants

1122
00:41:37.742 --> 00:41:39.676
is entirely another matter.

1123
00:41:39.676 --> 00:41:42.810
LAURA: Maybe the dragon has a yeti for a butler.

1124
00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:46.041
MARISHA: Maybe they're just scavengers.

1125
00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:46.874
SAM: (sighs)

1126
00:41:46.874 --> 00:41:49.652
TRAVIS: We have to know more.
We have to go in, we have to see.

1127
00:41:49.652 --> 00:41:51.669
SAM: You want me to get super drunk and go in?

1128
00:41:51.669 --> 00:41:53.361
LAURA: No.

1129
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:54.509
TRAVIS: Not particularly.

1130
00:41:54.509 --> 00:41:57.485
SAM: I can invisible myself and probably sneak past--

1131
00:41:57.485 --> 00:42:00.430
LAURA: Can you invisible somebody who's not drunk?

1132
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.904
TRAVIS: Could you go invisible and not be shit-faced?

1133
00:42:03.904 --> 00:42:05.681
SAM: Yes.

1134
00:42:05.681 --> 00:42:07.598
TRAVIS: That might be better.

1135
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.609
Can you only make yourself invisible?

1136
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:12.983
SAM: I think I can only make myself invisible.

1137
00:42:12.983 --> 00:42:16.895
MICA: What if I send in an animal that can see in the dark,

1138
00:42:16.895 --> 00:42:20.452
like a bat, and then we can see what it is?

1139
00:42:20.452 --> 00:42:23.419
TRAVIS: Can you see through that animal's eyes?

1140
00:42:23.419 --> 00:42:25.665
MICA: No, but it can come back and then I can talk to it.

1141
00:42:25.665 --> 00:42:26.838
TRAVIS: What if it doesn't survive?

1142
00:42:26.838 --> 00:42:28.276
SAM: I can make someone else invisible.

1143
00:42:28.276 --> 00:42:29.856
MICA: What if it's upstairs on the ceiling?

1144
00:42:29.856 --> 00:42:32.076
Then they can't see it, right?

1145
00:42:32.076 --> 00:42:34.088
TALIESIN: I mean--
MICA: It's worth a try.

1146
00:42:34.088 --> 00:42:35.082
TALIESIN: It's not a terrible idea.

1147
00:42:35.082 --> 00:42:37.391
LAURA: A bat is, you know, they would just go in the cave.

1148
00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:38.889
TRAVIS: Sure, let's go for it, yeah.

1149
00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:41.172
LAURA: Is there such a thing as a snow bat?

1150
00:42:41.172 --> 00:42:44.366
MICA: I don't know, but I think
bats are pretty strong, right?

1151
00:42:44.366 --> 00:42:46.302
TRAVIS: How smart are they?

1152
00:42:46.302 --> 00:42:48.483
MARISHA: Bats are actually pretty smart.

1153
00:42:48.483 --> 00:42:50.736
I tried to convince my dad to give me one,

1154
00:42:50.736 --> 00:42:53.888
I wanted a pet bat, and he wouldn't let me.

1155
00:42:53.888 --> 00:42:55.886
MICA: You read lots of books so I trust you.

1156
00:42:55.886 --> 00:42:57.742
TRAVIS: You you wanted a pet bat?
MARISHA: Thank you.

1157
00:42:57.742 --> 00:43:01.815
Yeah, this was after I asked for the snake.

1158
00:43:01.815 --> 00:43:02.905
TRAVIS: Okay.

1159
00:43:02.905 --> 00:43:04.229
MICA: Oh, Mr. DM.
MATT: Yes.

1160
00:43:04.229 --> 00:43:05.602
MICA: Do you happen to have bat stats?

1161
00:43:05.602 --> 00:43:08.221
MATT: I do.
LAURA: We also have them right here.

1162
00:43:08.221 --> 00:43:09.237
MICA: Oh, we do?

1163
00:43:09.237 --> 00:43:11.043
MARISHA and MICA: ♪ Bat stats ♪

1164
00:43:11.043 --> 00:43:12.263
TRAVIS: Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

1165
00:43:12.263 --> 00:43:13.347
MICA: Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

1166
00:43:13.347 --> 00:43:15.299
I forgot to put it in my extras

1167
00:43:15.299 --> 00:43:17.258
because I didn't think that I would need a bat.

1168
00:43:17.258 --> 00:43:21.154
MATT: Armor class of 12, one hit point,
speed of 30 feet flying,

1169
00:43:21.154 --> 00:43:23.199
but they do have blindsight 60 feet,

1170
00:43:23.199 --> 00:43:25.384
so they can sense things without light

1171
00:43:25.384 --> 00:43:26.467
within 60 feet of them.

1172
00:43:26.467 --> 00:43:27.498
MICA: Bat.

1173
00:43:27.498 --> 00:43:29.509
Does anybody have any other suggestions

1174
00:43:29.509 --> 00:43:32.858
of an animal that should go in and look?

1175
00:43:32.858 --> 00:43:35.371
TRAVIS: No, actually your idea is great. It's very low risk.

1176
00:43:35.371 --> 00:43:36.389
LAURA: Bat is smart.

1177
00:43:36.389 --> 00:43:37.770
SAM: Seems like it would fit right in.

1178
00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:40.945
MICA: Cool, I would like to cast--

1179
00:43:42.392 --> 00:43:46.079
SAM: Will you see through the bat's eyes?

1180
00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:47.698
MICA: With Conjure Woodland Beings, I don't.

1181
00:43:47.698 --> 00:43:49.325
TRAVIS: The bat comes back out and she talks to it.

1182
00:43:49.325 --> 00:43:51.261
SAM: Okay.
MICA: Right?

1183
00:43:52.194 --> 00:43:53.305
LAURA: No, you don't.

1184
00:43:53.305 --> 00:43:54.915
MATT: You do not, no, you just--

1185
00:43:54.915 --> 00:43:58.431
SAM: Are you summoning a bat or a swarm of bats?

1186
00:43:58.431 --> 00:44:01.735
LAURA: One bat.
SAM: I disagree with that.

1187
00:44:01.735 --> 00:44:04.368
MICA: At a 4th-level, I can summon--

1188
00:44:04.368 --> 00:44:06.966
TRAVIS: Save the 4th-level. (pigeon coos)

1189
00:44:06.966 --> 00:44:09.261
MICA: That's the only level I can cast it at. (coos)

1190
00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:10.693
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

1191
00:44:10.693 --> 00:44:14.852
MICA: Yeah, I want to summon-- what's the challenge rating?

1192
00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:16.238
MATT: Challenge rating is zero.

1193
00:44:16.238 --> 00:44:17.790
MICA: Can I summon eight bats, please?

1194
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.811
MATT: Yes, you may.
MICA: I would like to summon eight bats.

1195
00:44:19.811 --> 00:44:20.914
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Amazing.

1196
00:44:20.914 --> 00:44:22.574
TRAVIS: Do they obey what you say and stuff?

1197
00:44:22.574 --> 00:44:23.407
MICA: Yes.

1198
00:44:23.407 --> 00:44:25.084
MATT: All these bats skitter and land

1199
00:44:25.084 --> 00:44:26.651
inside the dome, where it's warm--

1200
00:44:26.651 --> 00:44:28.602
TRAVIS: Get out of the fucking dome! (yelling)

1201
00:44:28.602 --> 00:44:30.118
MICA: No, they're friends, they're friends!

1202
00:44:30.118 --> 00:44:34.532
Then I would like to cast Speak With Animals.

1203
00:44:34.532 --> 00:44:35.409
MATT: All right.

1204
00:44:35.409 --> 00:44:38.814
MICA: I would like to say: Hello, friends,

1205
00:44:38.814 --> 00:44:41.078
we have a special mission for you,

1206
00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:43.983
I would like you to go into the cave, be quiet,

1207
00:44:43.983 --> 00:44:46.777
really quiet, and I want you to see what's in there

1208
00:44:46.777 --> 00:44:49.124
and then come back and then tell me, pretty please.

1209
00:44:49.124 --> 00:44:51.070
MATT: All right, double-checking one thing real fast.

1210
00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:52.818
Perfect, yeah, Speak With Animals is not concentration.

1211
00:44:52.818 --> 00:44:56.165
So all eight bats look at each other and back at you and go,

1212
00:44:56.165 --> 00:44:58.068
"Okay! "Okay!" "Okay!" "Okay!"

1213
00:44:58.068 --> 00:45:00.344
MICA: Okay, bye, be safe!

1214
00:45:00.344 --> 00:45:03.478
MATT: You watch them emerge, and the wind hits and they all

1215
00:45:03.478 --> 00:45:05.226
have to like, bear down before,

1216
00:45:05.226 --> 00:45:06.282
but they make their way around

1217
00:45:06.282 --> 00:45:07.814
and they all enter the cavern.

1218
00:45:07.814 --> 00:45:11.578
TRAVIS: Big-ass roc comes up,
picks them out of the sky. Fuck.

1219
00:45:11.578 --> 00:45:12.657
MICA: Don't kill my bats.
TRAVIS: No no no,

1220
00:45:12.657 --> 00:45:15.133
I don't want a roc, I don't want a roc.

1221
00:45:15.133 --> 00:45:19.489
MATT: About a minute and a half, two minutes pass.

1222
00:45:19.489 --> 00:45:21.072
Three minutes pass.

1223
00:45:22.613 --> 00:45:25.089
Then you see come around the corner.

1224
00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:26.814
(squeaking)

1225
00:45:26.814 --> 00:45:29.686
A bunch of these bats return and land inside,

1226
00:45:29.686 --> 00:45:31.303
landing on your arms and shoulders.

1227
00:45:31.303 --> 00:45:33.771
MICA: I'm like a Disney princess, like oh.

1228
00:45:33.771 --> 00:45:34.966
(laughter)

1229
00:45:34.966 --> 00:45:36.507
Yeah, exactly!

1230
00:45:38.442 --> 00:45:39.957
MATT: The best Disney princess ever.

1231
00:45:39.957 --> 00:45:41.221
MARISHA: Fucking dope.

1232
00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:42.639
MICA: Covered in bats.

1233
00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:43.639
MATT: I love it.

1234
00:45:45.482 --> 00:45:49.368
All right, so yeah, the bats express to you,

1235
00:45:49.368 --> 00:45:51.790
with their rudimentary intelligence,

1236
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:55.207
to the best of their ability, that,

1237
00:45:56.615 --> 00:46:00.476
"There's a room with, like, a cave across it."

1238
00:46:00.476 --> 00:46:01.634
MICA: Uh-huh.

1239
00:46:01.634 --> 00:46:03.956
MATT: "And there's some tents in there."

1240
00:46:03.956 --> 00:46:04.798
MICA: Oh.

1241
00:46:04.798 --> 00:46:06.744
MATT: "And some fuzzy people."

1242
00:46:06.744 --> 00:46:07.905
MICA: Oh!

1243
00:46:07.905 --> 00:46:09.092
Fuzzy people. Okay.

1244
00:46:09.092 --> 00:46:10.750
Then I go: Thank you, darlings!

1245
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.619
And I un-summon them.

1246
00:46:12.619 --> 00:46:13.724
LAURA: What'd they say?

1247
00:46:13.724 --> 00:46:16.497
MICA: They said that there is a room with another room,

1248
00:46:16.497 --> 00:46:18.665
the rooms have tents and fuzzy people.

1249
00:46:18.665 --> 00:46:19.940
LAURA: Tents?
MICA: Tents.

1250
00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.441
TALIESIN: They didn't saw how many fuzzy people, did they?

1251
00:46:21.441 --> 00:46:22.947
MICA: Nope, they just said people.

1252
00:46:22.947 --> 00:46:24.575
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait.

1253
00:46:24.575 --> 00:46:26.800
So the yetis live in tents?

1254
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.757
SAM: If they're yetis.
TRAVIS: Yeah, if they're yetis.

1255
00:46:28.757 --> 00:46:32.243
MICA: On the plus side, no dragon.

1256
00:46:32.243 --> 00:46:34.061
Or on the downside, no dragon.

1257
00:46:34.061 --> 00:46:35.680
TRAVIS: I think it's on the downside.

1258
00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.706
MARISHA: You're a fuzzy person.
TALIESIN: Am I?

1259
00:46:38.706 --> 00:46:39.678
MARISHA: A little.

1260
00:46:39.678 --> 00:46:41.842
SAM: They said that there was another cave?

1261
00:46:41.842 --> 00:46:43.844
MICA: Yes. There were rooms.

1262
00:46:43.844 --> 00:46:47.475
SAM: So there could be a further cave beyond this

1263
00:46:47.475 --> 00:46:48.796
that the dragon is in.

1264
00:46:48.796 --> 00:46:49.997
TALIESIN: Deeper in.

1265
00:46:49.997 --> 00:46:52.184
MICA: Is that what they communicated to me?

1266
00:46:52.184 --> 00:46:54.556
MATT: It seems the best you can ascertain. They're bats.

1267
00:46:54.556 --> 00:46:57.033
SAM: This is an outer lair.

1268
00:46:57.033 --> 00:46:57.866
TALIESIN: All right.

1269
00:46:57.866 --> 00:47:00.017
SAM: We might have to surpass this one first

1270
00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:04.140
before we get to the gooey white dragon center.

1271
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.154
MARISHA: Unless there's just a whole other cave

1272
00:47:06.154 --> 00:47:08.230
on the other side of the mountain.

1273
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:09.428
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: We'll find that out--

1274
00:47:09.428 --> 00:47:12.120
LAURA: Or like higher up? How tall is the mountain?

1275
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.223
Are we looking at a cave really low on the mountain

1276
00:47:14.223 --> 00:47:16.661
and there's like, a lot of mountain?

1277
00:47:16.661 --> 00:47:19.661
MATT: Make an intelligence check for me.

1278
00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:26.471
LAURA: ♪ It's about as good as I expected ♪

1279
00:47:26.471 --> 00:47:27.441
MATT: Three.

1280
00:47:27.441 --> 00:47:29.807
LAURA: Oh, wait, that's a saving throw.

1281
00:47:29.807 --> 00:47:32.159
Yeah, no, it's still a three.

1282
00:47:32.159 --> 00:47:32.992
MATT: It's fine.

1283
00:47:32.992 --> 00:47:35.952
No, you ascertain, by Essek's communication,

1284
00:47:35.952 --> 00:47:40.318
that this teleportation spell was successful directly.

1285
00:47:40.318 --> 00:47:41.662
TRAVIS: To where we said to go.

1286
00:47:41.662 --> 00:47:42.837
MATT: To where you said to go.

1287
00:47:42.837 --> 00:47:46.457
So you're pretty sure this is Mythburrow,

1288
00:47:46.457 --> 00:47:47.751
where you were looking for.

1289
00:47:47.751 --> 00:47:49.313
TALIESIN: We just may have to go deeper in.

1290
00:47:49.313 --> 00:47:52.136
SAM: Or higher up, or down below.
LAURA: That's what I mean, like--

1291
00:47:52.136 --> 00:47:52.969
SAM: Sure.

1292
00:47:52.969 --> 00:47:55.268
TALIESIN: At the very least, I think we should explore.

1293
00:47:55.268 --> 00:47:57.283
SAM: How wide is the mouth of the cave?

1294
00:47:57.283 --> 00:48:00.468
MATT: It's roughly 20-ish feet wide.

1295
00:48:00.468 --> 00:48:01.687
20, 25 feet wide.

1296
00:48:01.687 --> 00:48:03.820
LAURA: How high on the mountain is the cave

1297
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.511
comparatively to the rest of the height of the mountain?

1298
00:48:06.511 --> 00:48:10.381
MATT: Oh, it's, I'm going to say it's about maybe

1299
00:48:10.381 --> 00:48:14.648
150 feet from like the base level of most of this valley

1300
00:48:14.648 --> 00:48:17.108
at the base of the mountain, and the mountain itself

1301
00:48:17.108 --> 00:48:21.204
is probably, at least this range can go up to

1302
00:48:21.204 --> 00:48:24.449
three, four, five, 6000 feet at times.

1303
00:48:24.449 --> 00:48:26.312
Like, it's a mountain range.

1304
00:48:26.312 --> 00:48:27.145
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1305
00:48:27.145 --> 00:48:30.504
MICA: If we make sure we sleep and we rest,

1306
00:48:30.504 --> 00:48:34.192
I can turn into a giant hawk and I can go

1307
00:48:34.192 --> 00:48:35.838
check out the mountain to see if there are other caves,

1308
00:48:35.838 --> 00:48:37.354
if you want me to.
LAURA: I can do that, too

1309
00:48:37.354 --> 00:48:38.787
and so can Caleb.

1310
00:48:38.787 --> 00:48:40.318
We turn into giant eagles.

1311
00:48:40.318 --> 00:48:42.371
MICA: Should we go on an adventure?

1312
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:44.095
SAM: You want to do that now, before bed?

1313
00:48:44.095 --> 00:48:46.820
LAURA: We can check out the higher up and see if

1314
00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.762
there's a higher cave.

1315
00:48:47.762 --> 00:48:49.097
TALIESIN: Before bedtime might be a good idea.

1316
00:48:49.097 --> 00:48:51.185
Some of us can stay here and a couple of people

1317
00:48:51.185 --> 00:48:53.302
can do a scouting--

1318
00:48:53.302 --> 00:48:56.129
MARISHA: Caleb has to stay here.

1319
00:48:56.129 --> 00:48:57.884
LAURA: Okay, so we can go.

1320
00:48:57.884 --> 00:48:59.460
TRAVIS: Lots of wind, right?

1321
00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.960
If the dragon happens to be out and about or whatever,

1322
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.429
then you're on your own, and in the air.

1323
00:49:04.429 --> 00:49:07.133
TALIESIN: Message immediately if you see anything.

1324
00:49:07.133 --> 00:49:10.602
LAURA: I don't think I can message if I'm an eagle,

1325
00:49:10.602 --> 00:49:14.368
but I can dive really fast

1326
00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:15.961
back to the dome.

1327
00:49:15.961 --> 00:49:17.572
SAM: And you're going to use the buddy system, right?

1328
00:49:17.572 --> 00:49:19.145
MICA: Buddy system, we're going to stay together.

1329
00:49:19.145 --> 00:49:19.978
LAURA: Mm-hmm, yeah.

1330
00:49:19.978 --> 00:49:20.894
TRAVIS: Sure, go for it.

1331
00:49:20.894 --> 00:49:22.878
There doesn't seem to be any safe way to do this, so.

1332
00:49:22.878 --> 00:49:23.711
TALIESIN: No.

1333
00:49:23.711 --> 00:49:26.126
LAURA: White eagles so that, you know,

1334
00:49:26.126 --> 00:49:28.151
we'll blend in with the snow and stuff.

1335
00:49:28.151 --> 00:49:30.436
MICA: I think that's a good idea.

1336
00:49:30.436 --> 00:49:31.304
MATT: Okay.

1337
00:49:31.304 --> 00:49:33.414
So you're using your Wild Shape to become a white eagle

1338
00:49:33.414 --> 00:49:34.905
and you're using--
LAURA: Polymorph.

1339
00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:36.946
MATT: Polymorph, all right.

1340
00:49:36.946 --> 00:49:39.585
You both, your physical forms expand,

1341
00:49:39.585 --> 00:49:40.911
the feathers protruding until you both

1342
00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:42.887
are these majestic white eagles that are forced

1343
00:49:42.887 --> 00:49:44.950
to step out of the dome, because of just the size

1344
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:46.989
and the space you take up, but you both

1345
00:49:46.989 --> 00:49:50.506
glance at each other, (caws) (flapping)

1346
00:49:50.506 --> 00:49:53.053
and begin to you make your way, pushing through the wind.

1347
00:49:53.053 --> 00:49:55.127
With your size and your wingspan,

1348
00:49:55.127 --> 00:49:56.833
it's not too much of a challenge for you

1349
00:49:56.833 --> 00:49:58.432
in comparison to the bats necessarily,

1350
00:49:58.432 --> 00:50:00.262
though it is challenging, you begin to make your way

1351
00:50:00.262 --> 00:50:01.941
up the side of the mountain.

1352
00:50:01.941 --> 00:50:03.277
You have a little more time than she does,

1353
00:50:03.277 --> 00:50:06.355
but you have an hour before this spell fades.

1354
00:50:06.355 --> 00:50:07.755
MICA: What do we see?

1355
00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:09.434
MATT: Both of you guys make a perception check

1356
00:50:09.434 --> 00:50:11.859
using the perception of a giant eagle.

1357
00:50:11.859 --> 00:50:14.480
LAURA: Ah, plus four.
MICA: Plus four, okay.

1358
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.914
MATT: Because it is a giant eagle,

1359
00:50:18.914 --> 00:50:21.746
they do, I believe, have advantage on sight,

1360
00:50:21.746 --> 00:50:24.281
but because of the snow storm, your vision is halved,

1361
00:50:24.281 --> 00:50:25.295
so it's just a straight roll.

1362
00:50:25.295 --> 00:50:27.006
MICA: It's okay, I rolled 23.

1363
00:50:27.006 --> 00:50:27.839
MATT: Nice.

1364
00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:28.689
LAURA: I rolled a 14.

1365
00:50:28.689 --> 00:50:31.018
MATT: A 14, okay.

1366
00:50:31.018 --> 00:50:32.679
It's hard for you to see at this distance

1367
00:50:32.679 --> 00:50:34.594
going up the side of the mountain, but Reani,

1368
00:50:34.594 --> 00:50:36.707
as you scan about and make your way up,

1369
00:50:36.707 --> 00:50:39.505
you do see a handful of other caves

1370
00:50:39.505 --> 00:50:41.982
across the surface of the nearby mountain range,

1371
00:50:41.982 --> 00:50:45.352
in the 40 minutes or so as you circle around.

1372
00:50:45.352 --> 00:50:46.724
They're all fairly small.
MICA: Okay.

1373
00:50:46.724 --> 00:50:49.111
MATT: 10-foot, five-foot, a lot of them appear to be

1374
00:50:49.111 --> 00:50:51.904
just natural areas where either the rock

1375
00:50:51.904 --> 00:50:54.597
just slightly recesses in, or the entrance

1376
00:50:54.597 --> 00:50:56.390
of the caves themselves are meant

1377
00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:01.390
to house smaller creatures or were areas where long ago,

1378
00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:04.948
the volcanic activity that may have formed

1379
00:51:04.948 --> 00:51:08.544
some of these mountains had created some sort of a hole,

1380
00:51:08.544 --> 00:51:11.207
but nothing that seems to be large enough

1381
00:51:11.207 --> 00:51:15.155
to allow the entry and exit of something

1382
00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:16.867
as large as the white dragon you seek.

1383
00:51:16.867 --> 00:51:18.155
MICA: Got it.

1384
00:51:18.155 --> 00:51:19.799
So I guess after 40 minutes as an eagle,

1385
00:51:19.799 --> 00:51:22.655
I shake my head and then point my head back down,

1386
00:51:22.655 --> 00:51:24.421
like we should go back.

1387
00:51:24.421 --> 00:51:26.878
LAURA: We've gone as high as the mountain?

1388
00:51:26.878 --> 00:51:30.408
MATT: You've gone pretty close to the peak, yeah.

1389
00:51:30.408 --> 00:51:33.891
LAURA: I go and use my feathers and go:

1390
00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:38.638
(laughter)

1391
00:51:38.638 --> 00:51:41.423
MICA: The thumbs-up as a giant eagle.

1392
00:51:41.423 --> 00:51:43.491
Yeah, so I guess I'll make my way back to the hut.

1393
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:44.763
MATT: All right.

1394
00:51:44.763 --> 00:51:46.531
You guys dive back down.

1395
00:51:46.531 --> 00:51:47.922
While they're away--

1396
00:51:47.922 --> 00:51:50.554
TRAVIS: Fuck.
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1397
00:51:50.554 --> 00:51:53.111
You guys are sitting there, and you hear

1398
00:51:53.111 --> 00:51:55.996
this guttural grunting sound,

1399
00:51:55.996 --> 00:51:58.782
and around the edge, you see

1400
00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:03.773
roughly a nine to 10-foot tall humanoid creature.

1401
00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:09.131
Blue-gray, thick, hide-like skin around the face

1402
00:52:09.131 --> 00:52:13.242
and fingers, but a thick, thick, white matted fur

1403
00:52:13.242 --> 00:52:16.062
that covers most of the body.

1404
00:52:16.062 --> 00:52:18.220
It looks across between a man

1405
00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:21.187
and like an albino gorilla.

1406
00:52:23.028 --> 00:52:26.285
You see two of them come around the edge,

1407
00:52:26.285 --> 00:52:28.702
just glancing around.

1408
00:52:32.062 --> 00:52:34.487
They walk by.

1409
00:52:37.128 --> 00:52:39.638
One of them leans on the dome as it pushed by

1410
00:52:39.638 --> 00:52:42.046
and it its hand hits and

1411
00:52:42.046 --> 00:52:43.288
uses it to push along.

1412
00:52:43.288 --> 00:52:44.795
MARISHA: How big did it look like?

1413
00:52:44.795 --> 00:52:49.795
MATT: The hand, from thumb to pinky was probably about

1414
00:52:49.795 --> 00:52:52.687
a foot and a half, if not two.

1415
00:52:54.224 --> 00:52:57.451
If not a little bigger.

1416
00:52:57.451 --> 00:52:59.899
Eventually, they meander back and return

1417
00:52:59.899 --> 00:53:02.687
to the edge of the cave where they came from.

1418
00:53:02.687 --> 00:53:03.912
TALIESIN: Were they just wandering?

1419
00:53:03.912 --> 00:53:05.017
Were they wearing anything?

1420
00:53:05.017 --> 00:53:08.129
Did they have tools or were they just wandering?

1421
00:53:08.129 --> 00:53:10.230
MATT: The ones that you saw wandering out

1422
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:12.335
weren't wearing anything.

1423
00:53:12.335 --> 00:53:14.341
You didn't see any tools on them necessarily.

1424
00:53:14.341 --> 00:53:15.578
LAURA: (snickers)

1425
00:53:15.578 --> 00:53:17.534
TRAVIS: No bandoliers, no weapons, no spears.

1426
00:53:17.534 --> 00:53:19.436
No rifles--
SAM: Unfrozen lawyers?

1427
00:53:19.436 --> 00:53:21.433
(laughter)

1428
00:53:21.433 --> 00:53:22.738
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

1429
00:53:22.738 --> 00:53:23.871
Those are more to the south.
TALIESIN: No pouches with

1430
00:53:23.871 --> 00:53:25.549
material or anything like that.

1431
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:26.382
MATT: Didn't look like it.

1432
00:53:26.382 --> 00:53:27.594
TALIESIN: Okay, that's nice.

1433
00:53:27.594 --> 00:53:29.594
MATT: The eagles return.

1434
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.338
SAM: ♪ The Hotel California ♪
TRAVIS: Looks like the yetis wandered

1435
00:53:33.338 --> 00:53:35.345
back to where they came from?

1436
00:53:35.345 --> 00:53:37.242
Were they smelling the air?

1437
00:53:37.242 --> 00:53:39.174
MATT: Yes.

1438
00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:40.800
TRAVIS: Right.
LAURA: Nice.

1439
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.812
SAM: Turn back into people so we can talk to you.

1440
00:53:44.812 --> 00:53:47.886
LAURA: Yeah, right as I land, I'm going to like,

1441
00:53:47.886 --> 00:53:50.154
a foot off the ground turn into Jester.

1442
00:53:50.154 --> 00:53:52.794
MICA: Reani also does that, but not as gracefully

1443
00:53:52.794 --> 00:53:54.634
and trips a little bit, like catches herself.

1444
00:53:54.634 --> 00:53:56.948
MATT: Catches herself, perfect.

1445
00:53:56.948 --> 00:53:59.690
SAM: What did you discover?
LAURA: Thank you, thank you.

1446
00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:03.303
It's really snowy and the mountain's very high.
MICA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1447
00:54:03.303 --> 00:54:04.817
LAURA: There's a couple little caves, but they're

1448
00:54:04.817 --> 00:54:06.543
not big enough for a dragon, probably.

1449
00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:08.301
MICA: Unless it was a baby dragon,

1450
00:54:08.301 --> 00:54:09.364
but I don't think it's a baby dragon.

1451
00:54:09.364 --> 00:54:10.622
LAURA: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh,

1452
00:54:10.622 --> 00:54:12.063
I just had an idea.

1453
00:54:12.063 --> 00:54:13.879
MICA: Do we get to keep the baby dragon as a pet?

1454
00:54:13.879 --> 00:54:17.210
LAURA: Well, what if the dragon went in when he was a baby,

1455
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:20.614
he was, you know, the Terror in Ivory,

1456
00:54:20.614 --> 00:54:23.811
and then he grew and couldn't get back out,

1457
00:54:23.811 --> 00:54:26.212
and that's why nobody has seen him for 100 years.

1458
00:54:26.212 --> 00:54:28.612
SAM: It's a sailboat in a bottle.

1459
00:54:28.612 --> 00:54:30.363
He can't get out!

1460
00:54:30.363 --> 00:54:31.841
He's stuck in there!

1461
00:54:31.841 --> 00:54:33.576
MICA: If we can get him out, then maybe like,

1462
00:54:33.576 --> 00:54:36.248
he'll do things to us for a favor.

1463
00:54:36.248 --> 00:54:38.260
LAURA: Maybe we can just ride on him.

1464
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.615
MICA: Oh my god, do you think he'd let us?

1465
00:54:39.615 --> 00:54:41.873
MARISHA: (as Beau) Yeah!

1466
00:54:41.873 --> 00:54:46.873
The Nightmare in Ivory is just a metaphor to his situation.

1467
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:51.093
It's his nightmare, and he's stuck in this ivory mountain.

1468
00:54:51.093 --> 00:54:53.257
MICA: See, he was nice the entire time.

1469
00:54:53.257 --> 00:54:57.060
SAM: Fjord, you're on board with this idea, aren't you?

1470
00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.623
TRAVIS: Yes.

1471
00:54:58.623 --> 00:55:01.239
Definitely baby dragon

1472
00:55:01.239 --> 00:55:04.825
stuck in frosty mountain.

1473
00:55:04.825 --> 00:55:07.581
MARISHA: (as Caleb) <i>Ja</i>, I'm playing two people today,

1474
00:55:07.581 --> 00:55:10.065
and <i>ja</i>, I agree with them.

1475
00:55:10.065 --> 00:55:11.664
SAM: She gets two votes!

1476
00:55:11.664 --> 00:55:13.115
(laughter)

1477
00:55:13.115 --> 00:55:17.365
TRAVIS: Caduceus has said nothing; it's not agreed upon--

1478
00:55:18.406 --> 00:55:20.176
TALIESIN: I just don't see the point of disagreeing

1479
00:55:20.176 --> 00:55:21.304
with anything yet.

1480
00:55:21.304 --> 00:55:24.556
TRAVIS: Oh, goddamn it--
MICA: See, Pinky's on our side, we win.

1481
00:55:24.556 --> 00:55:27.128
TALIESIN: I will speak when I think something

1482
00:55:27.128 --> 00:55:30.725
has particular value. I think right now it's going to be

1483
00:55:30.725 --> 00:55:32.491
an awful lot of seeing what comes at us,

1484
00:55:32.491 --> 00:55:34.413
and a lot of the plans we're making right now

1485
00:55:34.413 --> 00:55:36.912
I think are going to fall apart once we hit

1486
00:55:36.912 --> 00:55:40.182
the giant furry, pale--
MICA: Oh, fuzzy men.

1487
00:55:40.182 --> 00:55:41.249
TRAVIS: While you were away,

1488
00:55:41.249 --> 00:55:44.449
two of those furry-pawed creatures

1489
00:55:44.449 --> 00:55:48.774
that Frumpkin saw came out.

1490
00:55:48.774 --> 00:55:50.490
About nine to 10 feet tall,

1491
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:52.980
white fur, bluish-gray skin.

1492
00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.514
MARISHA: (as Beau) Big fucking hands.
TRAVIS: Very large, big paws.

1493
00:55:55.514 --> 00:55:56.482
LAURA: Did they seem nice?

1494
00:55:56.482 --> 00:55:58.657
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.
MICA: Have the Glassblades ever seen yetis

1495
00:55:58.657 --> 00:56:00.129
and would we know about them?

1496
00:56:00.129 --> 00:56:04.091
MATT: You have probably encountered

1497
00:56:04.091 --> 00:56:06.024
these entities once or twice.

1498
00:56:06.024 --> 00:56:07.271
MICA: Have I probably fought them?

1499
00:56:07.271 --> 00:56:08.770
MATT: You've probably fought them off,

1500
00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:11.202
or at least directed them away from individuals.

1501
00:56:11.202 --> 00:56:12.035
MICA: Got it.

1502
00:56:12.035 --> 00:56:13.197
MATT: So you are aware of the yetis,

1503
00:56:13.197 --> 00:56:14.528
and as they describe them, you know

1504
00:56:14.528 --> 00:56:15.672
exactly they're talking about.

1505
00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:16.968
MICA: Oh.

1506
00:56:16.968 --> 00:56:19.620
Okay, so we have to kill these guys.

1507
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.980
They're not nice, they attack townspeople,

1508
00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.666
and I think it'd be best if they were eradicated.

1509
00:56:24.666 --> 00:56:25.724
TRAVIS: So you've fought them before?

1510
00:56:25.724 --> 00:56:26.749
MICA: Yes.

1511
00:56:26.749 --> 00:56:29.969
TRAVIS: What are their weaknesses, do they have any?

1512
00:56:29.969 --> 00:56:31.804
(laughter)

1513
00:56:31.804 --> 00:56:34.245
MATT: Not too much in the way of weaknesses.

1514
00:56:34.245 --> 00:56:35.953
They definitely do well with cold,

1515
00:56:35.953 --> 00:56:39.567
and probably not the best means of assaulting them

1516
00:56:39.567 --> 00:56:41.794
with anything cold-related.

1517
00:56:41.794 --> 00:56:43.104
LAURA: So fire is better.

1518
00:56:43.104 --> 00:56:45.529
MICA: They like snow and they like cold,

1519
00:56:45.529 --> 00:56:48.529
so don't blow them with ice.

1520
00:56:48.529 --> 00:56:52.355
Other than that, they're meat, and meat can be stabbed.

1521
00:56:52.355 --> 00:56:53.667
SAM: All right.
TRAVIS: Yes.

1522
00:56:53.667 --> 00:56:57.433
SAM: Big question is should we assault these creatures

1523
00:56:57.433 --> 00:57:01.273
tonight, before we bed down, or tomorrow?

1524
00:57:01.273 --> 00:57:05.204
LAURA: I mean, it's look a whole city of them or something.

1525
00:57:05.204 --> 00:57:07.042
MICA: The bats only said tents.

1526
00:57:07.042 --> 00:57:08.233
How many did you guys see?

1527
00:57:08.233 --> 00:57:09.713
TRAVIS: Two.
TALIESIN: Only two.

1528
00:57:09.713 --> 00:57:11.491
MICA: Two is easy.

1529
00:57:11.491 --> 00:57:12.743
TALIESIN: Probably more.
MARISHA: (as Beau) Might be a good idea.

1530
00:57:12.743 --> 00:57:15.513
Then we get to sleep and be fully rested for the dragon.

1531
00:57:15.513 --> 00:57:18.395
SAM: We can draw them out with some noise,

1532
00:57:18.395 --> 00:57:20.685
and then we can wait for them at the mouth of the cave,

1533
00:57:20.685 --> 00:57:23.519
and when they come out, we ambush.

1534
00:57:23.519 --> 00:57:27.103
MARISHA: Seems like they take their patrol fairly

1535
00:57:27.103 --> 00:57:29.577
frequently. So yeah.

1536
00:57:29.577 --> 00:57:31.227
MICA: What if we drew them out a few at a time?

1537
00:57:31.227 --> 00:57:32.511
SAM: Yeah.

1538
00:57:32.511 --> 00:57:34.047
MARISHA: I think that's a good idea.

1539
00:57:34.047 --> 00:57:36.988
TRAVIS: Are we able to ration our ability

1540
00:57:36.988 --> 00:57:39.163
to attract them in that way?
LAURA: How hard were they to kill before?

1541
00:57:39.163 --> 00:57:42.527
MICA: How hard were they to kill before, oh great DM?

1542
00:57:42.527 --> 00:57:46.490
MATT: I mean, they usually, from your experience,

1543
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:50.171
they can be solitary or sometimes they travel in packs.

1544
00:57:50.171 --> 00:57:52.921
Three, four, at most you've seen.

1545
00:57:54.307 --> 00:57:57.453
They're hearty, but not impossible by any means.

1546
00:57:57.453 --> 00:57:59.187
MICA: But I took them down myself?

1547
00:57:59.187 --> 00:58:02.971
MATT: By yourself, yeah, one.
MICA: Okay.

1548
00:58:02.971 --> 00:58:04.315
MATT: Usually you had other Glassblades

1549
00:58:04.315 --> 00:58:06.225
at your disposal as part of this,

1550
00:58:06.225 --> 00:58:08.159
or you led them away into a situation

1551
00:58:08.159 --> 00:58:10.392
where they ended up getting themselves hurt or trapped

1552
00:58:10.392 --> 00:58:12.499
and then you managed to escape.

1553
00:58:12.499 --> 00:58:15.245
Though you do know that they have pretty nasty claws.

1554
00:58:15.245 --> 00:58:16.483
MICA: Ah.

1555
00:58:16.483 --> 00:58:18.978
I think with team work, we can take them out,

1556
00:58:18.978 --> 00:58:20.939
but be sure not to get scratched.

1557
00:58:20.939 --> 00:58:23.544
SAM: I love your can-do spirit.
MICA: Yeah!

1558
00:58:23.544 --> 00:58:25.113
TRAVIS: We need to rest tonight either way

1559
00:58:25.113 --> 00:58:26.355
before we do anything, right?.

1560
00:58:26.355 --> 00:58:27.379
MICA: Agreed.
TRAVIS: Don't we, yes?

1561
00:58:27.379 --> 00:58:28.762
MICA: Yes.
TRAVIS: Okay.

1562
00:58:28.762 --> 00:58:31.647
LAURA: Also, I don't want to fight all of them

1563
00:58:31.647 --> 00:58:33.668
and use up all of our abilities

1564
00:58:33.668 --> 00:58:36.798
and then be on empty when we fight the dragon.

1565
00:58:36.798 --> 00:58:40.983
MICA: Who is feeling up to fighting at least one fuzzy man?

1566
00:58:40.983 --> 00:58:43.028
TALIESIN: I'm good to support.

1567
00:58:43.028 --> 00:58:44.826
MICA: So we draw out one fuzzy man,

1568
00:58:44.826 --> 00:58:47.739
we see how we feel, we take a nap, we fight a dragon.

1569
00:58:47.739 --> 00:58:49.824
TRAVIS: I would love to have your enthusiasm,

1570
00:58:49.824 --> 00:58:52.307
but two just came out and we did nothing.

1571
00:58:52.307 --> 00:58:54.264
MICA: We draw out two fuzzy men, there are

1572
00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:58.534
one, two, three, four, five--
SAM: There's nine of us.

1573
00:58:58.534 --> 00:58:59.902
We're the Mighty Nein.

1574
00:58:59.902 --> 00:59:02.167
TALIESIN: There's never actually been nine.

1575
00:59:02.167 --> 00:59:03.562
SAM: I'm sorry?
MICA: What?

1576
00:59:03.562 --> 00:59:05.567
LAURA: Just ignore, it's fine.

1577
00:59:05.567 --> 00:59:07.695
MICA: There's seven.

1578
00:59:07.695 --> 00:59:09.526
One, two, three, four, five, six--

1579
00:59:09.526 --> 00:59:11.782
MARISHA: Just go like this, Mighty Nein!

1580
00:59:11.782 --> 00:59:12.681
MICA: Mighty Nein!

1581
00:59:12.681 --> 00:59:13.579
MARISHA: There you go, you got it now.

1582
00:59:13.579 --> 00:59:14.693
MICA: Okay.

1583
00:59:14.693 --> 00:59:18.703
There's seven, and so seven versus two means we win.

1584
00:59:18.703 --> 00:59:21.029
TRAVIS: Look--
MICA: Two fuzzy men.

1585
00:59:21.029 --> 00:59:24.490
TRAVIS: We made this dome close to the entrance of the cave,

1586
00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:26.708
so if there's a ruckus, I'm sure it will be loud.

1587
00:59:26.708 --> 00:59:28.457
MICA: They can't see us in the dome.

1588
00:59:28.457 --> 00:59:29.290
TALIESIN: We also don't have

1589
00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:30.582
Caleb if we get into to this fight,

1590
00:59:30.582 --> 00:59:31.845
because Caleb's got to stay in the dome.

1591
00:59:31.845 --> 00:59:35.115
MICA: Oh, there's six of us.
TRAVIS: Right, and I am a little bit

1592
00:59:35.115 --> 00:59:37.732
under-equipped at the moment.

1593
00:59:37.732 --> 00:59:39.517
SAM: So five.

1594
00:59:39.517 --> 00:59:40.609
MICA: You can't fight?

1595
00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:43.676
TRAVIS: No, I can fight, I can fight.

1596
00:59:43.676 --> 00:59:46.516
LAURA: He can grapple them.

1597
00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:50.000
TRAVIS: I have a whip and a dagger and a glove.

1598
00:59:51.428 --> 00:59:53.241
MICA: A dagger can stab through meat.

1599
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:56.761
Fuzzy men are meat, we can fight.

1600
00:59:56.761 --> 00:59:58.436
MARISHA: I think it'd better if we cleared out

1601
00:59:58.436 --> 01:00:00.761
some of this now.

1602
01:00:00.761 --> 01:00:02.091
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

1603
01:00:02.091 --> 01:00:04.261
TALIESIN: There are two currently walking around.

1604
01:00:04.261 --> 01:00:05.907
LAURA: Did they go back in the--

1605
01:00:05.907 --> 01:00:07.043
MATT: They went back inside.

1606
01:00:07.043 --> 01:00:08.293
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

1607
01:00:08.293 --> 01:00:11.346
What if I take the handy dandy stone that you gave me.

1608
01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:12.317
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
MICA: Oh.

1609
01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:16.234
LAURA: I toss it out in front of it, and then like,

1610
01:00:16.234 --> 01:00:19.343
(growling), and that's the sound that it makes.

1611
01:00:19.343 --> 01:00:20.765
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
(laughter)

1612
01:00:20.765 --> 01:00:24.406
LAURA: Then they come out,

1613
01:00:24.406 --> 01:00:26.131
and we can tie a rope

1614
01:00:26.131 --> 01:00:28.533
across the thing, and then as soon as they come out,

1615
01:00:28.533 --> 01:00:31.377
they trip, and then they're prone, and then we attack them.

1616
01:00:31.377 --> 01:00:33.852
TRAVIS: In the front of the cave?

1617
01:00:33.852 --> 01:00:36.451
LAURA: We stealthily pull a rope across--

1618
01:00:36.451 --> 01:00:38.972
MARISHA: Yeah, in the mouth of the cave.

1619
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:42.247
MICA: In addition to this plan, I think that we take

1620
01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:44.228
the people that want to fight the most,

1621
01:00:44.228 --> 01:00:47.289
which seems like me and you and you and you,

1622
01:00:47.289 --> 01:00:50.293
to help, and you and maybe sometimes you,

1623
01:00:50.293 --> 01:00:52.365
and we go a little bit down the mountain,

1624
01:00:52.365 --> 01:00:53.920
just enough so they can come out,

1625
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.419
and we won't disturb possibly the fuzzy men sleeping,

1626
01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.278
because what if the morning we have to fight

1627
01:00:58.278 --> 01:00:59.890
more fuzzy men, and then we have to fight a dragon,

1628
01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.475
and then we all die.

1629
01:01:01.475 --> 01:01:03.411
So I think we take out some fuzzy men now,

1630
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:04.954
so we don't have to take out more fuzzy men later.

1631
01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:09.838
MARISHA: Can Caleb hang out the hut and throws fireballs?

1632
01:01:09.838 --> 01:01:12.850
MATT: You can throw spells outside of the dome,

1633
01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:16.392
but from inside, nothing can come inside.

1634
01:01:17.334 --> 01:01:18.559
MARISHA: (as Caleb) <i>Ja</i>, so, you know,

1635
01:01:18.559 --> 01:01:20.643
if you get them close enough,

1636
01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:22.837
you know, I can, as you all know,

1637
01:01:22.837 --> 01:01:26.162
fire is my specialty, ha ha ha ha.

1638
01:01:26.162 --> 01:01:29.616
SAM: From the dome, do we have line of sight

1639
01:01:29.616 --> 01:01:30.848
on the mouth of the cave?

1640
01:01:30.848 --> 01:01:31.681
MATT: No.
SAM: Great.

1641
01:01:31.681 --> 01:01:33.865
MATT: Because you guys made the dome on the side.

1642
01:01:33.865 --> 01:01:36.290
LAURA: Okay, so we bring them towards the dome.

1643
01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:38.362
TRAVIS: What is the range on Fireball and the other--

1644
01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:40.387
SAM: I think it's like 120 or something?

1645
01:01:40.387 --> 01:01:42.994
LAURA: So we just need to get them within sight of the dome.

1646
01:01:42.994 --> 01:01:46.059
MICA: We take them 119 feet down the mountain.

1647
01:01:46.059 --> 01:01:50.219
MARISHA: Fireball is 150 feet.
TRAVIS: Great, okay, good.

1648
01:01:50.219 --> 01:01:51.726
MATT: Wait, no, all other creatures and objects

1649
01:01:51.726 --> 01:01:52.962
are barred from passing through it.

1650
01:01:52.962 --> 01:01:54.465
Spells and other magical effects can't extend

1651
01:01:54.465 --> 01:01:55.869
through the dome or be cast through it, so no.

1652
01:01:55.869 --> 01:01:57.364
TRAVIS: Fucking shit!

1653
01:01:57.364 --> 01:01:58.339
MATT: So he is stuck in there.

1654
01:01:58.339 --> 01:01:59.332
MICA: Through it or around it?

1655
01:01:59.332 --> 01:02:00.957
Can he poke his head out and be like, "Pew pew?"

1656
01:02:00.957 --> 01:02:03.561
MATT: I will say if he pokes his head out, the spell ends.

1657
01:02:03.561 --> 01:02:06.474
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, so no, he's sitting in that bitch.

1658
01:02:06.474 --> 01:02:11.219
MARISHA: Is it because it's like his-- can he like, no.

1659
01:02:11.219 --> 01:02:12.494
TRAVIS: Nope.

1660
01:02:12.494 --> 01:02:14.494
MATT: It's-- yeah.

1661
01:02:14.494 --> 01:02:16.938
Otherwise, the spell would be a little too powerful.

1662
01:02:16.938 --> 01:02:18.086
TRAVIS: Let's try it.

1663
01:02:18.086 --> 01:02:20.645
Let's try to lure one or two.

1664
01:02:20.645 --> 01:02:22.402
MICA: Green man wants to try, yay!

1665
01:02:22.402 --> 01:02:23.845
SAM: You seem nervous about this.

1666
01:02:23.845 --> 01:02:26.305
TRAVIS: I am excited.

1667
01:02:26.305 --> 01:02:27.205
SAM: Care for a drink?

1668
01:02:27.205 --> 01:02:28.780
TRAVIS: Inspired-- yes actually, I would not--

1669
01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.882
SAM: Here.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1670
01:02:29.882 --> 01:02:31.981
(sniffs) Ooh.
SAM: That's my breath.

1671
01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.920
LAURA: We can prep our spells, prep our attacks.

1672
01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.693
MATT: So you guys are plotting the entranceway.

1673
01:02:37.693 --> 01:02:38.958
MICA: I think we're plotting a little, like--

1674
01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:41.578
LAURA: Yeah, so what we're going to try to do is lure them.

1675
01:02:41.578 --> 01:02:42.747
MATT: Let me show you the layout, then,

1676
01:02:42.747 --> 01:02:44.149
if that's what you're going to do.
(cheering)

1677
01:02:44.149 --> 01:02:45.377
MATT: Because it'll help you strategize better.

1678
01:02:45.377 --> 01:02:47.117
TALIESIN: That's all we really wanted this entire time.

1679
01:02:47.117 --> 01:02:49.970
MICA: We just wanted to see your maps, Matt.

1680
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:51.236
TALIESIN: Show me your maps.

1681
01:02:51.236 --> 01:02:53.618
SAM: Matt is getting us ready for combat,

1682
01:02:53.618 --> 01:02:56.340
which is powered by Dwarven Forge.

1683
01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.331
They just launched Plaguestone, a new line of sets

1684
01:02:59.331 --> 01:03:00.933
tied to Pathfinder Second Edition--

1685
01:03:00.933 --> 01:03:02.092
Pathfinder Second Edition?

1686
01:03:02.092 --> 01:03:05.881
Check it out now at Dwarvenforge.com.

1687
01:03:05.881 --> 01:03:08.060
LAURA and MICA: Whoa!
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

1688
01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.736
MARISHA: That's cool, that's cool.

1689
01:03:09.736 --> 01:03:11.224
TALIESIN: ♪ Oh the weather outside is ♪

1690
01:03:11.224 --> 01:03:12.644
SAM: Whoa.

1691
01:03:12.644 --> 01:03:13.477
MATT: All right.

1692
01:03:13.477 --> 01:03:14.861
SAM: It's not me, I've only--

1693
01:03:14.861 --> 01:03:16.164
MICA: This is so rad!

1694
01:03:16.164 --> 01:03:17.943
MATT: So you guys are all situated over here.

1695
01:03:17.943 --> 01:03:20.267
SAM: Whoa, there's a fine powder all over it.

1696
01:03:20.267 --> 01:03:22.400
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Matt, this is so cool.

1697
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.874
MICA: If I sneezed, would that make a mess?

1698
01:03:23.874 --> 01:03:25.582
MATT: Yes, it would.

1699
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:29.144
TRAVIS: Wow, is that table salt?

1700
01:03:29.144 --> 01:03:30.867
MATT: No, this is actually fake snow from the hobby shop.

1701
01:03:30.867 --> 01:03:32.128
TRAVIS: That's awesome.

1702
01:03:32.128 --> 01:03:33.474
SAM: Imagine the street value.

1703
01:03:33.474 --> 01:03:36.309
TALIESIN: I was hooping for it.

1704
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:38.563
MATT: So this is the arrangement. Here's the front

1705
01:03:38.563 --> 01:03:40.655
of the cavern, and the mountain continues further down.

1706
01:03:40.655 --> 01:03:43.070
This is one of the plateaus as it rises up further

1707
01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:45.455
up this direction, but this is the entryway.

1708
01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:46.905
TALIESIN: Do I have a laser anymore?

1709
01:03:46.905 --> 01:03:49.926
MICA: How far away is that, is right here?

1710
01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.270
MATT: Each one of these is five feet,

1711
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:53.824
so from where you guys are here, it's about like--

1712
01:03:53.824 --> 01:03:55.471
TRAVIS: You know, just given the topography,

1713
01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:57.195
if we could lure one to the edge--

1714
01:03:57.195 --> 01:03:58.597
MATT: About 90, 95 feet to the edge.

1715
01:03:58.597 --> 01:04:00.852
MICA: Yeah, we should get it to like here.

1716
01:04:00.852 --> 01:04:02.596
We should lure it to--

1717
01:04:02.596 --> 01:04:06.977
MARISHA: <i>Ja</i>, you know, I can always recast my hut.

1718
01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:07.818
SAM: Oh!

1719
01:04:07.818 --> 01:04:09.406
So you could be part of this fight?

1720
01:04:09.406 --> 01:04:11.536
MARISHA: I will be a part of this fight.

1721
01:04:11.536 --> 01:04:13.826
SAM: Well then, let's station you somewhere hidden.

1722
01:04:13.826 --> 01:04:15.680
MARISHA: Very far away.

1723
01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.340
SAM: 149 feet away.

1724
01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.545
TALIESIN: In the meantime, perhaps it's good to keep the

1725
01:04:19.545 --> 01:04:22.850
hut up as a place of safety, if we need to retreat.

1726
01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:24.911
SAM: Setting ourselves for the ambush, right?

1727
01:04:24.911 --> 01:04:27.009
TALIESIN: Or if someone is knocked unconscious,

1728
01:04:27.009 --> 01:04:28.366
we can bring them somewhere.

1729
01:04:28.366 --> 01:04:31.582
SAM: Okay, so Caleb will be 149 feet away,

1730
01:04:31.582 --> 01:04:33.965
and you'll have your fire powers ready.

1731
01:04:33.965 --> 01:04:34.798
MARISHA: <i>Ja</i>.

1732
01:04:34.798 --> 01:04:36.048
SAM: I will be--

1733
01:04:37.381 --> 01:04:39.880
I will be hidden as well, and I can fire upon them

1734
01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.589
when they emerge from the cave.

1735
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:42.727
LAURA: Okay.

1736
01:04:42.727 --> 01:04:44.809
SAM: When they emerge, is there any way to get them

1737
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:48.116
to stick or to trip or to fall?

1738
01:04:48.116 --> 01:04:50.265
Are we doing that trip wire plan?

1739
01:04:50.265 --> 01:04:52.023
LAURA: I mean, we can try, yeah.

1740
01:04:52.023 --> 01:04:53.508
TALIESIN: I can throw some sounds.

1741
01:04:53.508 --> 01:04:55.415
LAURA: It'd probably be hard to see-- Me, too.

1742
01:04:55.415 --> 01:04:56.248
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1743
01:04:56.248 --> 01:04:57.081
MARISHA: (as Beau) Could attempt to stun them,

1744
01:04:57.081 --> 01:05:00.457
which I will do regardless, but I'm assuming

1745
01:05:00.457 --> 01:05:01.523
that they're pretty hearty.
LAURA: Caleb does have a lot of

1746
01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:04.048
silver wire. We can run it

1747
01:05:04.048 --> 01:05:07.203
along, and then they can trip and fall off the side.

1748
01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:11.076
MARISHA: That's true, from where he always makes his thing.

1749
01:05:11.076 --> 01:05:15.917
MATT: The silver thread is quite thin.

1750
01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:17.880
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

1751
01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.547
TRAVIS: Like dental floss.

1752
01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:25.926
TALIESIN: I say we get them down over here.

1753
01:05:25.926 --> 01:05:27.812
LAURA: This is dumb, this is so dumb.

1754
01:05:27.812 --> 01:05:28.645
SAM: No, it's perfect.

1755
01:05:28.645 --> 01:05:30.832
TALIESIN: We can lure them down here, then we just have

1756
01:05:30.832 --> 01:05:32.181
some coverage, and we can do it,

1757
01:05:32.181 --> 01:05:34.638
and it'll take them too long to get back to the cave--

1758
01:05:34.638 --> 01:05:36.618
TRAVIS: The same on either side, so.
MICA: Question.

1759
01:05:36.618 --> 01:05:37.984
MATT: Yes.

1760
01:05:37.984 --> 01:05:41.853
MICA: Would this planning session count
as a brief short rest,

1761
01:05:41.853 --> 01:05:43.088
since we're just sitting in the hut

1762
01:05:43.088 --> 01:05:44.628
and we've just been sitting for a while?

1763
01:05:44.628 --> 01:05:45.461
MATT: I'd allow it.

1764
01:05:45.461 --> 01:05:46.542
MICA: Thank you!

1765
01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:47.897
MATT: I'd allow it.

1766
01:05:47.897 --> 01:05:49.703
MICA: I just wanted my Wild Shape back so bad!

1767
01:05:49.703 --> 01:05:50.830
MATT: If you guys want to take the hour here,

1768
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:52.574
yeah, you can do that.

1769
01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:54.432
MICA: Bless you, DM.

1770
01:05:55.426 --> 01:05:56.858
TRAVIS: All right, so what are we doing?

1771
01:05:56.858 --> 01:05:59.008
SAM: All right, Caleb where you going to be?

1772
01:05:59.008 --> 01:06:01.817
MARISHA: (as Caleb) As far away as possible.

1773
01:06:01.817 --> 01:06:04.161
TALIESIN: Stay in the dome for now.

1774
01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:06.885
LAURA: Yeah, you can just drop it as soon as he crosses,

1775
01:06:06.885 --> 01:06:08.074
he needs to, yeah.

1776
01:06:08.074 --> 01:06:09.931
TALIESIN: In the meantime, it's a safe place to bring--

1777
01:06:09.931 --> 01:06:11.711
MARISHA: (as Beau) Okay, I dig it, I'm into it.
TALIESIN: -- unconscious people, just in case.

1778
01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:13.978
SAM: I will call for you when they--

1779
01:06:13.978 --> 01:06:16.128
LAURA: Where should I toss the stone to?

1780
01:06:16.128 --> 01:06:17.366
SAM: -- come out.

1781
01:06:17.366 --> 01:06:18.916
TALIESIN: Down here, maybe.
MICA: Yeah.

1782
01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:21.629
LAURA: To where it lures them like over here?

1783
01:06:21.629 --> 01:06:23.299
MICA: I think, yeah, because behind the rock,

1784
01:06:23.299 --> 01:06:25.084
because then they're trapped behind the rock.

1785
01:06:25.084 --> 01:06:29.267
TRAVIS: I will stay with Caleb also, just because

1786
01:06:29.267 --> 01:06:31.075
someone needs to watch out for him.

1787
01:06:31.075 --> 01:06:33.004
TALIESIN: Well, are we going to tie it to a rope

1788
01:06:33.004 --> 01:06:34.598
and then make it move?

1789
01:06:34.598 --> 01:06:36.365
SAM: What are we trying to a rope?
MICA: That's smart.

1790
01:06:36.365 --> 01:06:37.644
TALIESIN: Because then we can start it over there

1791
01:06:37.644 --> 01:06:39.955
and then we can reel it back in as they start to come out.

1792
01:06:39.955 --> 01:06:43.477
MICA: So if we throw the stone in the front of the cave

1793
01:06:43.477 --> 01:06:46.004
and then we reel it in, so they come to here,

1794
01:06:46.004 --> 01:06:47.359
so they're backed up against this,

1795
01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:49.272
and then we can attack them.

1796
01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:50.937
LAURA: Then we hit everything--

1797
01:06:50.937 --> 01:06:52.485
TALIESIN: I'll hit them with Bane and you guys

1798
01:06:52.485 --> 01:06:54.053
can hit them with some other stuff.

1799
01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:56.075
MICA: I can turn into a scorpion and poison then.

1800
01:06:56.075 --> 01:06:57.233
TALIESIN: It could be fun.

1801
01:06:57.233 --> 01:06:58.833
TRAVIS: Let's start--

1802
01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:00.355
MARISHA: That's a good plan, that's a good plan.

1803
01:07:00.355 --> 01:07:01.480
SAM: I like this plan.

1804
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.346
However, recall that the talking stone

1805
01:07:03.346 --> 01:07:06.061
only says a word every five minutes.

1806
01:07:06.061 --> 01:07:07.797
So we're going to get one word out of this thing.

1807
01:07:07.797 --> 01:07:08.630
TRAVIS: That's right.

1808
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:10.125
LAURA: Well no, it doesn't say one word,

1809
01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:11.875
it says a message every five minutes.

1810
01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:14.130
So technically, I could talk for like,

1811
01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.249
four and a half minutes into it,

1812
01:07:16.249 --> 01:07:18.243
drop it, and it would make a noise every 30 seconds.

1813
01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:19.877
SAM: Is that true?

1814
01:07:19.877 --> 01:07:21.958
MATT: I'll say I'll limit it to about a minute of audio.

1815
01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:23.761
(laughter)

1816
01:07:23.761 --> 01:07:25.342
LAURA: I could talk into it for a like minute,

1817
01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:27.418
and then every four minutes it would do something.

1818
01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:28.376
TALIESIN: We also have Thaumaturgy,

1819
01:07:28.376 --> 01:07:30.240
so we can make sounds happen

1820
01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.566
within 30 feet.
MICA: Once they get close.

1821
01:07:32.566 --> 01:07:34.061
SAM: Then we don't need the rock at all.

1822
01:07:34.061 --> 01:07:36.426
LAURA: We do because we can do it at a distance.

1823
01:07:36.426 --> 01:07:38.782
MICA: Also yetis can see things, they'll look at the rock

1824
01:07:38.782 --> 01:07:40.642
and follow it like a dog.

1825
01:07:40.642 --> 01:07:42.595
MARISHA: I also have firecrackers.

1826
01:07:42.595 --> 01:07:45.294
TALIESIN: That might be a lot to bring too many.

1827
01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:46.605
MARISHA: I'm just pointing it out.

1828
01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:47.654
TALIESIN: We know.

1829
01:07:47.654 --> 01:07:48.751
LAURA: So what should I do?

1830
01:07:48.751 --> 01:07:51.265
Like, I'm just going to maybe sound like a baby yeti

1831
01:07:51.265 --> 01:07:54.102
or like an animal that's hurting.

1832
01:07:54.102 --> 01:07:55.441
TRAVIS: What does a baby yeti sound like?

1833
01:07:55.441 --> 01:07:56.522
TALIESIN: I'm very-- yeah.

1834
01:07:56.522 --> 01:07:58.344
LAURA: (croaking)

1835
01:07:58.344 --> 01:07:59.344
SAM: Yeah.

1836
01:07:59.344 --> 01:08:00.922
MICA: Yeah.

1837
01:08:00.922 --> 01:08:03.973
SAM: Yeah, should it be howling, howling loud.

1838
01:08:03.973 --> 01:08:06.444
LAURA: (loud croaking)

1839
01:08:06.444 --> 01:08:07.968
TRAVIS: What if it's like a little lower,

1840
01:08:07.968 --> 01:08:09.340
like a little more gruff?

1841
01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:12.154
LAURA: (growling)

1842
01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.686
TALIESIN: Yeah, it needs a [inaudible] component.

1843
01:08:13.686 --> 01:08:15.498
LAURA: I'm going to talk into the stone.
MATT: Okay.

1844
01:08:15.498 --> 01:08:19.928
LAURA: (growling)

1845
01:08:19.928 --> 01:08:21.327
MATT: All right.
SAM: Are you recording right now?

1846
01:08:21.327 --> 01:08:22.160
LAURA: Yeah, squeezing.

1847
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.905
SAM: Sorry, start again.

1848
01:08:23.905 --> 01:08:25.603
(laughter)

1849
01:08:25.603 --> 01:08:26.633
TRAVIS: Jesus.
SAM: Sorry.

1850
01:08:26.633 --> 01:08:28.803
MARISHA: Okay, everyone, quiet, everyone quiet.

1851
01:08:28.803 --> 01:08:30.474
SAM and MARISHA: Room tone.

1852
01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:32.833
(laughter)

1853
01:08:32.833 --> 01:08:34.927
LAURA: (growling)

1854
01:08:34.927 --> 01:08:36.411
I'm not going to do this for a minute.

1855
01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:39.418
(laughter)

1856
01:08:39.418 --> 01:08:40.924
SAM: Performance check?

1857
01:08:40.924 --> 01:08:42.844
LAURA: I was doing it pretty loud, he was probably rolling

1858
01:08:42.844 --> 01:08:44.785
a perception check.

1859
01:08:44.785 --> 01:08:46.270
MATT: Yep.

1860
01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.440
SAM: Shit.

1861
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:51.982
MATT: One of them begins to peek around the side there,

1862
01:08:51.982 --> 01:08:53.483
going (grunting).

1863
01:08:53.483 --> 01:08:55.565
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a little bit of sound down there

1864
01:08:55.565 --> 01:08:57.659
using Thaumaturgy, and it's going to make--

1865
01:08:57.659 --> 01:08:59.275
SAM: The whole plan is gone?

1866
01:08:59.275 --> 01:09:02.279
MATT: No spell can pass by the shell while you're inside it.

1867
01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:04.076
LAURA: I'm going to toss, oh god.

1868
01:09:04.076 --> 01:09:04.909
Gimme the stone.

1869
01:09:04.909 --> 01:09:06.860
SAM: Don't do anything, just let it go back in the cave.

1870
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:08.156
LAURA: I'm going to use the silver thread

1871
01:09:08.156 --> 01:09:10.649
and tie it around the stone.

1872
01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:11.743
MATT: Okay, you tie it around the stone.

1873
01:09:11.743 --> 01:09:14.843
SAM: Don't do anything!

1874
01:09:14.843 --> 01:09:17.019
Just let it go back in the cave.

1875
01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:17.860
LAURA: Why?

1876
01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:20.133
SAM: Because we're not ready for an ambush.

1877
01:09:20.133 --> 01:09:22.847
MARISHA: Well, we can cut it off.
MATT: It moves over to the edge there.

1878
01:09:22.847 --> 01:09:24.839
LAURA: I'm just going to toss it.
SAM: All right.

1879
01:09:24.839 --> 01:09:25.784
LAURA: I'm going to toss--

1880
01:09:25.784 --> 01:09:27.303
MATT: Another one comes out here.

1881
01:09:27.303 --> 01:09:29.636
MICA: Oh, that one looks angrier.

1882
01:09:29.636 --> 01:09:31.523
SAM: I'm not in posish!

1883
01:09:31.523 --> 01:09:33.073
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to squeeze the rock

1884
01:09:33.073 --> 01:09:35.806
so it doesn't make noise again.

1885
01:09:35.806 --> 01:09:37.876
MARISHA: Let's see what they do.

1886
01:09:39.336 --> 01:09:41.953
MATT: They scope around a bit in the area,

1887
01:09:41.953 --> 01:09:43.873
glance by and look off this way,

1888
01:09:43.873 --> 01:09:45.981
and then both eventually go back inside.

1889
01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:48.406
SAM: Okay, now we can set our ambush.

1890
01:09:49.306 --> 01:09:50.990
LAURA: (groans) Okay, okay, okay.

1891
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:53.131
So what I need to do is come down,

1892
01:09:53.131 --> 01:09:56.313
make the noise into the rock and then leave.

1893
01:09:56.313 --> 01:09:58.180
MATT: Okay, so you head down this way?
LAURA: Yeah, quietly.

1894
01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.063
MICA: Isn't the noise already in the rock?

1895
01:09:59.063 --> 01:10:00.458
SAM: The noise is already in the rock.

1896
01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:02.556
MICA: So it's just going to play in another four minutes?

1897
01:10:02.556 --> 01:10:04.119
LAURA: It's going to play, I already squeezed it,

1898
01:10:04.119 --> 01:10:07.340
so if I squeeze it again will it just play the noise?

1899
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.823
MATT: It would, yeah, unless you're resetting it.

1900
01:10:08.823 --> 01:10:09.847
LAURA: Yeah.

1901
01:10:09.847 --> 01:10:12.901
MATT: Okay, so you move over here and you set it down where?

1902
01:10:12.901 --> 01:10:14.380
LAURA: That looks good.

1903
01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:18.126
MATT: Okay, so you're putting the rock--
MARISHA: I'm going to get into place as well.

1904
01:10:18.126 --> 01:10:20.048
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to set it down right here.

1905
01:10:20.048 --> 01:10:21.592
MATT: All right, so we'll say you put the rock there.

1906
01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:22.675
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay,

1907
01:10:22.675 --> 01:10:23.587
and then where are you going?

1908
01:10:23.587 --> 01:10:25.858
LAURA: Going to scamper away over here.

1909
01:10:25.858 --> 01:10:26.734
MATT: Okay, and you hide there.

1910
01:10:26.734 --> 01:10:28.697
SAM: Time's ticking! I'm going to leave the dome

1911
01:10:28.697 --> 01:10:32.539
and come out over the edge on the first platform down.

1912
01:10:32.539 --> 01:10:33.423
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1913
01:10:33.423 --> 01:10:34.520
SAM: Oh yes, yes, yes.

1914
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.982
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
LAURA: Ooh ooh! Can I--

1915
01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:37.967
SAM: 27.

1916
01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.482
LAURA: Can I move and try to get here

1917
01:10:39.482 --> 01:10:40.889
and hide behind this little outcropping?

1918
01:10:40.889 --> 01:10:41.750
MATT: Sure, I'll let do you that.

1919
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:43.734
MARISHA: I'm going to head in the same direction as Nott.

1920
01:10:43.734 --> 01:10:46.229
MATT: All right. Stealth check
SAM: I'm going to go ahead and be invisible.

1921
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:47.816
MATT: Okay, you cast Invisibility on yourself,

1922
01:10:47.816 --> 01:10:49.282
you are invisible.
MARISHA: 18.

1923
01:10:49.282 --> 01:10:52.797
MATT: 18, all right, where are you going?

1924
01:10:52.797 --> 01:10:54.610
MARISHA: Put me like right here.

1925
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:56.368
MATT: Right there? You got it.

1926
01:10:56.368 --> 01:10:57.497
Nott will be--

1927
01:10:59.354 --> 01:11:00.952
LAURA: You got to hide good, or else they're going to--

1928
01:11:00.952 --> 01:11:03.164
MARISHA: I know. Can I--

1929
01:11:03.164 --> 01:11:05.352
MATT: We'll say that's Nott right there.

1930
01:11:05.352 --> 01:11:06.687
MICA: Can I go where Beau's going?

1931
01:11:06.687 --> 01:11:07.803
MATT: Sure, roll a stealth check.

1932
01:11:07.803 --> 01:11:09.151
LAURA: Make sure they can't see you,

1933
01:11:09.151 --> 01:11:10.291
because they're going to come and look

1934
01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:11.698
over over the edge right here.
MICA: Oh shit, you're right.

1935
01:11:11.698 --> 01:11:13.187
SAM: They might even climb down the edge.

1936
01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:14.267
MICA: 17.

1937
01:11:14.267 --> 01:11:17.210
MATT: 17, okay, and you're heading over that way?

1938
01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.517
SAM: Let's not group up.

1939
01:11:18.517 --> 01:11:20.051
MICA: Can I go there, actually?

1940
01:11:20.051 --> 01:11:22.373
Will I be seen if I'm like, in that outcropping?

1941
01:11:22.373 --> 01:11:23.337
MATT and TRAVIS: You'll find out.

1942
01:11:23.337 --> 01:11:25.085
MICA: Fuck. (laughter)

1943
01:11:25.085 --> 01:11:27.306
MATT: You knew it was coming.

1944
01:11:27.306 --> 01:11:29.810
All right, Caduceus, Fjord, and Caleb,

1945
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:31.560
what are you guys doing?

1946
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.425
Caleb's staying, right?

1947
01:11:32.425 --> 01:11:35.307
MARISHA: (as Caleb) I will stay in the dome.

1948
01:11:35.307 --> 01:11:38.693
TALIESIN: I'm going to hide behind the dome.

1949
01:11:38.693 --> 01:11:41.726
So that I can run out and sling a spell when it's time

1950
01:11:41.726 --> 01:11:43.184
and then use it for cover.
MICA: Actually, wait,

1951
01:11:43.184 --> 01:11:45.518
hold on, that's way too close to the stone.

1952
01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:47.467
Can I go-- Is that possible?

1953
01:11:47.467 --> 01:11:49.020
Like behind there.
MATT: Right there, or up here?

1954
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.735
MICA: Like in there, yeah, in that little nook.

1955
01:11:50.735 --> 01:11:52.226
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Cool.

1956
01:11:52.226 --> 01:11:55.134
LAURA: I'm going to prepare--

1957
01:11:55.134 --> 01:11:58.709
I'm going to prepare to Invoke Duplicity.

1958
01:12:00.113 --> 01:12:03.008
As soon as they come out, I want to make

1959
01:12:03.008 --> 01:12:05.440
a duplicate of Jester come around here,

1960
01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.178
since it would be within--
MATT: You got it.

1961
01:12:07.178 --> 01:12:09.742
You're situated there or to the front, or where you want?

1962
01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:11.545
TALIESIN: Behind, yeah, that way I can run.

1963
01:12:11.545 --> 01:12:14.052
MATT: We'll say you're there, all right.

1964
01:12:14.052 --> 01:12:15.685
You guys wait a moment, that quiet,

1965
01:12:15.685 --> 01:12:18.480
you hear the (whooshing) of the wind,

1966
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.480
and then you hear the sudden eruption of (growling).

1967
01:12:24.042 --> 01:12:26.158
(laughter)

1968
01:12:26.158 --> 01:12:27.800
As soon as the noise happens, did you want to--

1969
01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.625
LAURA: Oh, no, I'm waiting till they come out

1970
01:12:30.625 --> 01:12:32.460
into the little--
MATT: Okay, got you.

1971
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.343
ALL: (exaggerated growling)

1972
01:12:34.343 --> 01:12:36.015
MATT: These two come out once more and

1973
01:12:36.015 --> 01:12:39.823
rush towards edge here and here,

1974
01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:42.340
and glance down.

1975
01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.762
This one begins to climb down.

1976
01:12:43.762 --> 01:12:44.977
MARISHA: (as Beau) I'm pressed up against the wall,

1977
01:12:44.977 --> 01:12:46.515
SAM: <i>I'm</i> pressing up against the wall.

1978
01:12:46.515 --> 01:12:48.996
MICA: I'm in the snow, I'm in the snow.

1979
01:12:50.213 --> 01:12:51.732
MATT: This one here leaps down.

1980
01:12:51.732 --> 01:12:54.560
MARISHA: I'm trying not to breathe.
SAM: Oh, leaps?

1981
01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.008
Oh!

1982
01:12:56.008 --> 01:12:57.442
MICA: Makes a superhero landing.

1983
01:12:57.442 --> 01:13:01.469
MATT: They both turn, this one lands

1984
01:13:01.469 --> 01:13:03.315
and they both look to the stone,

1985
01:13:03.315 --> 01:13:04.338
and out of the corner of its eye

1986
01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:05.848
begins to turn this direction,

1987
01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:09.389
something caught its eye this way as it turns.

1988
01:13:09.389 --> 01:13:12.589
MARISHA: I jump up and I fucking punch the one in his face!

1989
01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:13.947
MICA: Oh my god!

1990
01:13:13.947 --> 01:13:15.420
LAURA: Invoke Duplicity right here.

1991
01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:16.503
MATT: You got it.

1992
01:13:16.503 --> 01:13:18.507
All right, and with that, I need everyone

1993
01:13:18.507 --> 01:13:19.644
to roll initiative.

1994
01:13:19.644 --> 01:13:22.899
You do have a surprise attack on them, so go for it.

1995
01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.156
MARISHA: I just go right now?

1996
01:13:25.156 --> 01:13:25.989
MATT: Yes.

1997
01:13:25.989 --> 01:13:27.280
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to jump off,

1998
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.103
and with like a flying leap

1999
01:13:30.103 --> 01:13:33.516
with my stick, I'm going to come down with a big slap.

2000
01:13:33.516 --> 01:13:34.425
MATT: All right, go for it.

2001
01:13:34.425 --> 01:13:36.208
SAM: Slap it.

2002
01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:38.950
TRAVIS: ♪ Slappy Joe, slap slappy Joe ♪

2003
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:41.088
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a natural 19.

2004
01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:42.094
MATT: That'll hit.

2005
01:13:42.094 --> 01:13:43.465
MARISHA: 29.

2006
01:13:43.465 --> 01:13:44.298
TALIESIN: Ow.

2007
01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:49.186
MARISHA: Okay, nine damage and Stunning Strike.

2008
01:13:49.186 --> 01:13:52.279
MATT: Whew. All right.

2009
01:13:52.279 --> 01:13:53.629
MARISHA: Come on.

2010
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:55.379
MATT: Natural 16 plus three, 19.

2011
01:13:55.379 --> 01:13:57.271
It succeeds on the first Stunning Strike.

2012
01:13:57.271 --> 01:13:58.104
TRAVIS: Fucking yeti.

2013
01:13:58.104 --> 01:14:00.912
MARISHA: Plus three, plus three, okay, okay.

2014
01:14:00.912 --> 01:14:02.718
MICA: Ooh, I want the battle music.

2015
01:14:02.718 --> 01:14:04.132
MARISHA: 60% chance.

2016
01:14:04.132 --> 01:14:05.242
Okay.

2017
01:14:05.242 --> 01:14:06.474
Attack, attack.

2018
01:14:06.474 --> 01:14:07.378
I get to go again, right?

2019
01:14:07.378 --> 01:14:09.785
MATT: You do, you have your second attack.

2020
01:14:09.785 --> 01:14:11.503
MARISHA: Ew, 13.

2021
01:14:11.503 --> 01:14:13.245
MATT: 13 hits.

2022
01:14:13.245 --> 01:14:15.183
TALIESIN: Low AC, they're big.

2023
01:14:15.183 --> 01:14:17.170
MARISHA: Low AC, they're big.

2024
01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:21.109
Okay, eight damage and Stunning Strike.

2025
01:14:21.109 --> 01:14:22.350
MATT: All righty.

2026
01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:23.433
MARISHA: Roll lower.

2027
01:14:24.441 --> 01:14:27.165
MATT: That's a 16 total.

2028
01:14:27.165 --> 01:14:28.111
MARISHA: Nope.

2029
01:14:28.111 --> 01:14:31.070
MATT: Nope, resists it again.

2030
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:33.917
TRAVIS: What's the save, is it 16?

2031
01:14:33.917 --> 01:14:37.344
MARISHA: 15 is my ki save, which sucks.

2032
01:14:37.344 --> 01:14:38.448
TALIESIN: I'll have Bane up soon.

2033
01:14:38.448 --> 01:14:40.052
MATT: You have your bonus action still.

2034
01:14:40.052 --> 01:14:43.156
MARISHA: Bonus action, Patient Defense.

2035
01:14:43.156 --> 01:14:45.064
MATT: You go into your Patient Defense,

2036
01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:46.930
and now everyone roll initiative.

2037
01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:48.346
SAM: Woo!
MICA: I got 16.

2038
01:14:48.346 --> 01:14:49.672
MATT: 16, all right.

2039
01:14:49.672 --> 01:14:50.997
So 25 to 20.

2040
01:14:50.997 --> 01:14:51.988
LAURA: 20.

2041
01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.252
All right.

2042
01:14:53.252 --> 01:14:54.184
We have Jester.

2043
01:14:54.184 --> 01:14:56.097
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2044
01:14:56.097 --> 01:14:57.365
MATT: 20 to 15?

2045
01:14:57.365 --> 01:14:58.198
MARISHA: 19.

2046
01:14:58.198 --> 01:14:59.031
MATT: 19 for Beau.

2047
01:14:59.031 --> 01:15:00.932
SAM: 19 for Nott.

2048
01:15:00.932 --> 01:15:02.943
MATT: Beau, and we'll say Nott's going to go first,

2049
01:15:02.943 --> 01:15:04.253
because Nott has the higher dexterity.

2050
01:15:04.253 --> 01:15:05.381
16 for Reani.

2051
01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:06.214
MARISHA: (whispered) Jester.

2052
01:15:06.214 --> 01:15:07.479
MICA: You guys go in order, my bad.

2053
01:15:07.479 --> 01:15:09.137
MATT: No, it's all good. It's your first time in our battle.

2054
01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:10.127
MICA: I'm learning, I'm learning!

2055
01:15:10.127 --> 01:15:13.850
TALIESIN: Welcome to the Thunderdome.
MATT: 15 to 10?

2056
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:16.201
TRAVIS: Caleb is--
MARISHA: 16 for Caleb.

2057
01:15:16.201 --> 01:15:17.376
Sorry, sorry.

2058
01:15:17.376 --> 01:15:19.445
MATT: Caleb and Reani are up at the same time.

2059
01:15:19.445 --> 01:15:22.715
MARISHA: Beau, Caleb, Reani.
MATT: Okay.

2060
01:15:22.715 --> 01:15:23.966
Anyone else?

2061
01:15:23.966 --> 01:15:25.094
TRAVIS: Four.

2062
01:15:25.094 --> 01:15:26.177
TALIESIN: Six.
MATT: Oh no.

2063
01:15:26.177 --> 01:15:28.790
MICA: Womp womp.
MATT: Cad and then Fjord.

2064
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:30.106
TALIESIN: You'd think I'd have my shit together,

2065
01:15:30.106 --> 01:15:31.114
but I don't.

2066
01:15:31.114 --> 01:15:33.258
MATT: Jester, you're up first.

2067
01:15:33.258 --> 01:15:35.132
LAURA: I'm going to cast Inf--

2068
01:15:35.132 --> 01:15:37.373
I'm going to run up with my duplicate,

2069
01:15:37.373 --> 01:15:41.840
and touch its leg and cast Inflict Wounds at 2nd-level.

2070
01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:45.460
MATT: All righty, go ahead and roll a melee spell attack.

2071
01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:47.023
LAURA: 17 plus nine, 26.

2072
01:15:47.023 --> 01:15:50.601
MATT: That definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2073
01:15:50.601 --> 01:15:53.200
TRAVIS: Damn, look at all those dice.

2074
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.712
MATT: At 2nd-level you cast it?

2075
01:15:54.712 --> 01:15:55.795
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Nice.

2076
01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:58.920
LAURA: 16, 18.

2077
01:15:59.876 --> 01:16:00.709
18.

2078
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:03.433
MATT: 18 points of damage.

2079
01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:06.483
LAURA: Necrotic.
MATT: Slick.

2080
01:16:06.483 --> 01:16:09.598
So you watch as the duplicate rushes out.

2081
01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:11.560
As it turns and sees Reani against the mountain,

2082
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.887
suddenly it hears this like charging of divine energy,

2083
01:16:15.887 --> 01:16:17.756
turns around and sees the duplicate reach out,

2084
01:16:17.756 --> 01:16:19.798
grab the leg, and suddenly watch the fur

2085
01:16:19.798 --> 01:16:21.965
strike in like a black-gray color

2086
01:16:21.965 --> 01:16:23.384
from where the hand grabs it.

2087
01:16:23.384 --> 01:16:26.036
It pulls back, (roaring), trying to pull his leg away

2088
01:16:26.036 --> 01:16:27.538
and you can see the muscle atrophy

2089
01:16:27.538 --> 01:16:29.603
from where it contacted.
TRAVIS: Dope!

2090
01:16:29.603 --> 01:16:31.866
LAURA: I have my duplicate back up and act like

2091
01:16:31.866 --> 01:16:33.760
she's defending herself.
MATT: You got it.

2092
01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.461
TRAVIS: Nice.
MATT: All righty.

2093
01:16:35.461 --> 01:16:36.909
You're going to stay put then, Jester?

2094
01:16:36.909 --> 01:16:37.916
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: All right.

2095
01:16:37.916 --> 01:16:39.091
Nott, you're up.

2096
01:16:39.091 --> 01:16:41.357
SAM: I will, I assume, losing Invisibility,

2097
01:16:41.357 --> 01:16:43.282
I will fire my crossbow bolt

2098
01:16:43.282 --> 01:16:45.626
at the one locked in with Beau.

2099
01:16:45.626 --> 01:16:46.709
MATT: You got it.

2100
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:49.100
SAM: Ooh, not good, 15.

2101
01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:50.178
MATT: You have advantage on the attack roll

2102
01:16:50.178 --> 01:16:52.700
because it doesn't see you.
SAM: That's right, I do.

2103
01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:53.867
That's cocked.

2104
01:16:55.207 --> 01:16:56.043
18.

2105
01:16:56.043 --> 01:16:58.010
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack.

2106
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.843
SAM: Yeah!

2107
01:16:59.884 --> 01:17:01.551
All right, yes.

2108
01:17:07.045 --> 01:17:12.045
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, still working on it. (laughs)

2109
01:17:12.724 --> 01:17:13.875
32.

2110
01:17:13.875 --> 01:17:16.172
MATT: (shocked laughter)

2111
01:17:16.172 --> 01:17:17.627
Nice!
SAM: Ah, you know what?

2112
01:17:17.627 --> 01:17:19.425
I'll pump in the Fury of the Small.

2113
01:17:19.425 --> 01:17:20.959
ALL: Yeah!

2114
01:17:20.959 --> 01:17:23.947
SAM: 41 points of damage.

2115
01:17:23.947 --> 01:17:25.768
MATT: All right, as you appear out of your Invisibility

2116
01:17:25.768 --> 01:17:29.179
screaming, fire the bolt, the creature just got pummeled

2117
01:17:29.179 --> 01:17:32.274
by Beauregard, and then turns around,

2118
01:17:32.274 --> 01:17:34.771
Beau gets into defense, and turns around its claws.

2119
01:17:34.771 --> 01:17:37.734
You can now see them up close, these large,

2120
01:17:37.734 --> 01:17:42.188
nasty looking pointed claws, its mouth is open, its teeth,

2121
01:17:42.188 --> 01:17:45.546
(roaring) roars in your face with these burning red eyes.

2122
01:17:45.546 --> 01:17:50.174
One of the eyes takes a crossbow bolt. (collapsing)

2123
01:17:50.174 --> 01:17:53.101
ALL: Oh!
MATT: And falls to the ground.

2124
01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:54.805
MARISHA: Oh!

2125
01:17:54.805 --> 01:17:55.957
MICA: Nice!

2126
01:17:55.957 --> 01:17:57.267
MARISHA: Amazing!
TALIESIN: Okay.

2127
01:17:57.267 --> 01:17:59.122
MICA: All right, all right, all right.

2128
01:17:59.122 --> 01:18:02.340
SAM: I will use my movement to climb back up

2129
01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.268
to the next level up.

2130
01:18:04.268 --> 01:18:05.243
MATT: All right.

2131
01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.868
SAM: How much further can I run, half distance, right?

2132
01:18:09.868 --> 01:18:12.401
MATT: Yeah, this is all, although you,

2133
01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:15.065
because of your ring I'm saying, I'm allowing to move--

2134
01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:16.318
SAM: Yeah, but climbing up, is that--

2135
01:18:16.318 --> 01:18:17.545
MATT: Oh, climbing up, sorry.

2136
01:18:17.545 --> 01:18:18.911
From that point there is going to take you

2137
01:18:18.911 --> 01:18:19.970
about 10 feet of movement.

2138
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:20.803
SAM: Okay.

2139
01:18:20.803 --> 01:18:22.674
Can I get close to the mouth of the cave?

2140
01:18:22.674 --> 01:18:26.766
MATT: Sure, you can get back 25 more feet.

2141
01:18:27.842 --> 01:18:28.771
There is where you can get.

2142
01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:30.236
SAM: Tuck there, and I'm going to bonus action

2143
01:18:30.236 --> 01:18:32.695
look down the cave and see if anyone's coming.

2144
01:18:32.695 --> 01:18:33.528
MATT: Okay.

2145
01:18:33.528 --> 01:18:35.237
SAM: I don't know if I can bonus action perceive.

2146
01:18:35.237 --> 01:18:36.467
MATT: You don't have that ability, unfortunately.

2147
01:18:36.467 --> 01:18:38.448
SAM: Okay, well then I'll just bonus action

2148
01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:39.844
crouch down, hide if I can.

2149
01:18:39.844 --> 01:18:40.726
MATT: You have nothing to hide behind.

2150
01:18:40.726 --> 01:18:42.021
SAM: Great.

2151
01:18:42.021 --> 01:18:42.858
Then I will--

2152
01:18:42.858 --> 01:18:44.041
MATT: You rush up, and you're just

2153
01:18:44.041 --> 01:18:46.202
looking inside the cavern right now.

2154
01:18:46.202 --> 01:18:48.665
SAM: Then I will bonus action to move

2155
01:18:48.665 --> 01:18:50.138
and tuck myself around the corner.

2156
01:18:50.138 --> 01:18:51.096
MATT: There you go.

2157
01:18:51.096 --> 01:18:52.020
TRAVIS: Good call, good call.

2158
01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.240
MATT: You got it. All right.

2159
01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.672
You do have darkvision, though.

2160
01:18:55.672 --> 01:18:58.272
SAM: Mm-hmm.
MATT: So I'll say you do see.

2161
01:18:58.272 --> 01:18:59.439
LAURA: Oh god.

2162
01:19:00.546 --> 01:19:01.379
MICA: Hello.

2163
01:19:01.379 --> 01:19:02.876
SAM: Oh god, it's right there.

2164
01:19:02.876 --> 01:19:04.004
MICA: Oh hell no.

2165
01:19:04.004 --> 01:19:06.250
MATT: Rushing out, the other two are

2166
01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:07.379
following up from behind.

2167
01:19:07.379 --> 01:19:08.435
LAURA: Oh god, oh god.

2168
01:19:08.435 --> 01:19:10.508
MATT: All right, but none of you know this,

2169
01:19:10.508 --> 01:19:11.986
only Nott knows this.

2170
01:19:11.986 --> 01:19:13.035
Beauregard, your turn.

2171
01:19:13.035 --> 01:19:16.099
MARISHA: All right, with an adrenaline kick from watching

2172
01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:18.869
Nott kill this guy, I'm going to leap over his body

2173
01:19:18.869 --> 01:19:21.518
and go for the one with the Jester duplicate.

2174
01:19:21.518 --> 01:19:24.777
MATT: Easy enough with your movement to get up next to it.

2175
01:19:24.777 --> 01:19:25.865
MARISHA: A-pop pop.

2176
01:19:25.865 --> 01:19:28.395
MATT: Rushing by the rock, it's going (growling).

2177
01:19:28.395 --> 01:19:29.901
(laughter)

2178
01:19:29.901 --> 01:19:31.459
The other yeti, go for it.

2179
01:19:31.459 --> 01:19:34.092
MARISHA: First attack.

2180
01:19:34.092 --> 01:19:36.055
15.
MATT: 15 hits.

2181
01:19:36.055 --> 01:19:38.604
MARISHA: That's good, that's good, 14 damage.

2182
01:19:38.604 --> 01:19:39.720
MATT: Nice.

2183
01:19:40.964 --> 01:19:43.280
MARISHA: And second attack.

2184
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.795
Yep, 21?

2185
01:19:45.795 --> 01:19:46.833
MATT: 21 hits.

2186
01:19:46.833 --> 01:19:48.439
MARISHA: And that's eight damage.

2187
01:19:48.439 --> 01:19:50.198
MATT: Slick.

2188
01:19:50.198 --> 01:19:51.570
SAM: Slick, slick.

2189
01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:55.232
MARISHA: I'm just going to Flurry of Blows this.

2190
01:19:55.232 --> 01:19:57.732
MATT: Go for it, two more strikes.

2191
01:20:00.804 --> 01:20:03.469
MARISHA: Yeah, those both hit with a seven and a 17.

2192
01:20:03.469 --> 01:20:04.302
MATT: Great.

2193
01:20:05.789 --> 01:20:09.825
MARISHA: Okay, that's 11 damage for the first,

2194
01:20:09.825 --> 01:20:12.775
and nine damage, no sorry,

2195
01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:15.600
10 damage for the second.

2196
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.668
MATT: All righty.

2197
01:20:22.503 --> 01:20:25.094
MARISHA: One more ki point, Stunning Strike?

2198
01:20:25.094 --> 01:20:26.361
On that last one?

2199
01:20:26.361 --> 01:20:28.263
MATT: Well, I would say you don't have to.

2200
01:20:28.263 --> 01:20:29.161
TRAVIS: Nice!

2201
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:30.735
MATT: Because you just--

2202
01:20:30.735 --> 01:20:32.218
between that and what Jester had done

2203
01:20:32.218 --> 01:20:34.397
the previous round to that one, as you pummel

2204
01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:36.479
the back of the head he falls to one knee

2205
01:20:36.479 --> 01:20:38.153
and looks up as that final hit, you come down

2206
01:20:38.153 --> 01:20:40.118
and crack it right square in the face

2207
01:20:40.118 --> 01:20:42.494
as you pull your fist back, it has a smear

2208
01:20:42.494 --> 01:20:44.930
and a bit of a trail of blood scatters across the snow

2209
01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:47.707
as the front of its face has caved in slightly.

2210
01:20:47.707 --> 01:20:48.540
LAURA: Yeah!

2211
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.979
MARISHA: Stunning Strike worked, you guys!

2212
01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.937
TALIESIN and LAURA: (shushing)

2213
01:20:52.937 --> 01:20:54.639
MARISHA: Sorry.

2214
01:20:54.639 --> 01:20:57.531
LAURA: I call over to Beau from my hiding spot.

2215
01:20:57.531 --> 01:21:00.251
Beau, grab the stone before it makes noise again

2216
01:21:00.251 --> 01:21:01.165
and squeeze it.

2217
01:21:01.165 --> 01:21:03.146
MARISHA: Okay, yeah I mean this fight's over, so.

2218
01:21:03.146 --> 01:21:04.347
(laughter)

2219
01:21:04.347 --> 01:21:05.732
MATT: Well, that's your next turn.

2220
01:21:05.732 --> 01:21:07.989
All right, that brings us to Reani's turn.

2221
01:21:07.989 --> 01:21:08.822
MICA: Everybody's dead, right?

2222
01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:10.830
MATT: It looks like it, yeah.

2223
01:21:12.393 --> 01:21:15.050
MICA: Fuck, all right, then I'm going to use my turn

2224
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:18.067
to sneak over to where Nott is and look into the cavern.

2225
01:21:18.067 --> 01:21:19.847
MATT: Okay.
MICA: Yeah.

2226
01:21:19.847 --> 01:21:21.034
And I have darkvision.

2227
01:21:21.034 --> 01:21:22.730
MATT: Right as you turn the corner, you can see now,

2228
01:21:22.730 --> 01:21:25.503
stepping into the light, another one of these yetis.

2229
01:21:25.503 --> 01:21:27.574
The fur, (growling).

2230
01:21:27.574 --> 01:21:28.407
MICA: Sweet.

2231
01:21:28.407 --> 01:21:29.253
MATT: It looks straight towards you,

2232
01:21:29.253 --> 01:21:30.567
and you see it was following, it was looking

2233
01:21:30.567 --> 01:21:31.818
to turn the corner.
MICA: Yeah?

2234
01:21:31.818 --> 01:21:34.019
MATT: It looks like it had noticed Nott rushing up

2235
01:21:34.019 --> 01:21:36.161
into the middle of the open and was following a path

2236
01:21:36.161 --> 01:21:38.132
until you jumped in the center.

2237
01:21:38.132 --> 01:21:39.159
MICA: I still have my action, right?

2238
01:21:39.159 --> 01:21:40.489
MATT: You do, that was just your movement.

2239
01:21:40.489 --> 01:21:42.448
MICA: I want to use Blight at the 4th-level.

2240
01:21:42.448 --> 01:21:43.281
TALIESIN: Jeez!

2241
01:21:43.281 --> 01:21:44.225
MATT: Okay!

2242
01:21:44.225 --> 01:21:46.429
MICA: I just want to see it and go: Huh!

2243
01:21:46.429 --> 01:21:47.998
MATT: You got it, reactionary.
MICA: Yeah.

2244
01:21:47.998 --> 01:21:49.892
MATT: Is that a constitution saving throw?

2245
01:21:49.892 --> 01:21:51.494
MICA: That is, yes, Con 16.

2246
01:21:51.494 --> 01:21:52.494
MATT: All right.

2247
01:21:53.416 --> 01:21:55.885
MICA: It's 8d8.
MATT: Rolled a natural 16, so--

2248
01:21:55.885 --> 01:21:57.181
MICA: So it's half.
MATT: It's half damage.

2249
01:21:57.181 --> 01:21:58.823
Still takes damage.

2250
01:21:58.823 --> 01:22:02.267
MATT: Man, good rolls so far for just saving throw stuff.

2251
01:22:02.267 --> 01:22:03.425
MICA: Can somebody help me math?

2252
01:22:03.425 --> 01:22:04.897
LAURA: Yes.
MICA: Thank you.

2253
01:22:04.897 --> 01:22:07.314
LAURA: 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 26, 32.

2254
01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:10.272
MICA: Half of 32.

2255
01:22:10.272 --> 01:22:13.941
MATT: All right, so that'd bring it to 16 points of

2256
01:22:13.941 --> 01:22:15.032
necrotic damage.

2257
01:22:15.032 --> 01:22:16.891
As you put your hands out in front of you,

2258
01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:18.702
invoking the spell, you watch as at

2259
01:22:18.702 --> 01:22:21.367
the base of its throat, where the fur is, that all blackens,

2260
01:22:21.367 --> 01:22:24.008
reaches up and grabs its throat for a second

2261
01:22:24.008 --> 01:22:26.909
and begins coughing and sputtering.

2262
01:22:26.909 --> 01:22:28.953
MICA: Then as my bonus action I want to summon

2263
01:22:28.953 --> 01:22:31.073
my Flame Blade, just so I'm ready.

2264
01:22:31.073 --> 01:22:33.035
MARISHA: Oh, cool.
MICA: Yeah.

2265
01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:35.488
MATT: Flame Blade is what level spell?

2266
01:22:35.488 --> 01:22:37.101
MICA: I'm going to cast it at my 2nd-level.

2267
01:22:37.101 --> 01:22:39.512
MATT: You can't cast two spells in the same round

2268
01:22:39.512 --> 01:22:41.828
unless one of them is a cantrip, unfortunately.

2269
01:22:41.828 --> 01:22:43.197
MICA: It says it's a bonus action.

2270
01:22:43.197 --> 01:22:45.196
MATT: It is, but that's the limitation.

2271
01:22:45.196 --> 01:22:46.753
MICA: Fine, then as my bonus action,

2272
01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:48.685
I want to turn into a giant fucking scorpion.

2273
01:22:48.685 --> 01:22:50.636
MATT: That is definitely viable.

2274
01:22:50.636 --> 01:22:52.365
MICA: Yeah! Somehow that's okay.

2275
01:22:52.365 --> 01:22:54.448
TALIESIN: Druids: Somehow That's Okay.

2276
01:22:54.448 --> 01:22:55.895
MICA: Druids, we're broken.

2277
01:22:55.895 --> 01:22:57.763
MARISHA: I love it.

2278
01:22:57.763 --> 01:23:00.647
MATT: So as it turns around and coughs and looks up at you

2279
01:23:00.647 --> 01:23:04.763
like it's vengeful, suddenly you transform into this

2280
01:23:04.763 --> 01:23:07.415
large, dark, chitinous scorpion,

2281
01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:10.787
claws out front, tail whipping and dripping venom.

2282
01:23:10.787 --> 01:23:13.724
The yeti goes, and looks taken aback

2283
01:23:13.724 --> 01:23:17.311
and a little unnerved by what it sees in front of you.

2284
01:23:17.311 --> 01:23:20.381
Nott, this happens two feet from you,

2285
01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:23.181
and is very unnerving.

2286
01:23:23.181 --> 01:23:24.929
SAM: (screaming)

2287
01:23:24.929 --> 01:23:26.445
MATT: You guys all hear Nott screaming

2288
01:23:26.445 --> 01:23:28.128
on the top of the mountainside.

2289
01:23:28.128 --> 01:23:29.418
TALIESIN: Well, I guess that's happening.

2290
01:23:29.418 --> 01:23:31.169
MATT: That finishes Reani's turn, Caleb is up.

2291
01:23:31.169 --> 01:23:32.660
Caleb sees this happen.

2292
01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:36.293
MARISHA: (as Caleb) Oh no, my friend is in need.

2293
01:23:36.293 --> 01:23:38.318
(laughter)

2294
01:23:38.318 --> 01:23:40.408
MATT: Caleb can see Nott, so.

2295
01:23:40.408 --> 01:23:42.300
MARISHA: Yeah, he can.

2296
01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.031
So he's going over.

2297
01:23:44.031 --> 01:23:45.723
MATT: Stepping over?

2298
01:23:45.723 --> 01:23:47.547
MARISHA: Yeah, his 30 feet, his movement.
TALIESIN: Dropping the dome.

2299
01:23:47.547 --> 01:23:49.109
MATT: Okay, the dome vanishes.

2300
01:23:49.109 --> 01:23:50.914
MARISHA: And hopefully he, yeah.

2301
01:23:50.914 --> 01:23:52.964
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, that's as far

2302
01:23:52.964 --> 01:23:55.507
as he can get right there.
MARISHA: That's as far as he can get?

2303
01:23:55.507 --> 01:23:56.923
MATT: He's not a monk. I know you're used to

2304
01:23:56.923 --> 01:23:57.931
a lot of movement.

2305
01:23:57.931 --> 01:23:59.295
Just a regular dude.

2306
01:23:59.295 --> 01:24:01.263
MARISHA: He can't see anything?

2307
01:24:01.263 --> 01:24:02.374
He can't see anything.

2308
01:24:02.374 --> 01:24:04.508
MATT: Right now, he can see a scorpion, he can't see--

2309
01:24:04.508 --> 01:24:07.255
MARISHA: I'll have him back up
and hug the wall a little bit.

2310
01:24:07.255 --> 01:24:08.128
MATT: Okay, like there?

2311
01:24:08.128 --> 01:24:09.119
MARISHA: Yeah.

2312
01:24:09.119 --> 01:24:10.945
MATT: Okay, that works.
SAM: Caleb, what are you doing?

2313
01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:11.899
MARISHA: What's going on?

2314
01:24:11.899 --> 01:24:13.122
SAM: There's yetis!

2315
01:24:13.122 --> 01:24:15.432
TRAVIS: Are you Schwarzenegger?
MARISHA: <i>Ja</i>!

2316
01:24:15.432 --> 01:24:17.726
TRAVIS: What's going on?

2317
01:24:17.726 --> 01:24:19.568
MARISHA: Get to the hut!

2318
01:24:19.568 --> 01:24:22.308
(laughter)

2319
01:24:22.308 --> 01:24:23.377
MATT: All righty.

2320
01:24:23.377 --> 01:24:25.219
That finishes Caleb's turn, now it's their go.

2321
01:24:25.219 --> 01:24:27.008
TRAVIS: You smell like poopy!

2322
01:24:27.008 --> 01:24:29.605
MATT: So this yeti's going to rush up, seeing the scorpion,

2323
01:24:29.605 --> 01:24:31.635
which has definitely distracted it,

2324
01:24:31.635 --> 01:24:33.109
It's going to glance over in your direction

2325
01:24:33.109 --> 01:24:35.083
and you're like, this is one thing that,

2326
01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:38.652
you noticed, you haven't really been the target of it yet,

2327
01:24:38.652 --> 01:24:40.669
but it looks at you angrily

2328
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:42.479
and you feel this chill run past you.

2329
01:24:42.479 --> 01:24:45.226
I need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw

2330
01:24:45.226 --> 01:24:47.527
using the scorpion's constitution.

2331
01:24:47.527 --> 01:24:49.996
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking shit!

2332
01:24:49.996 --> 01:24:51.571
LAURA: Oh no.

2333
01:24:51.571 --> 01:24:52.704
MICA: It's a solid five.

2334
01:24:52.704 --> 01:24:54.960
MATT: Ooh, okay.

2335
01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.986
The chill runs through you and you feel your body lock up,

2336
01:24:57.986 --> 01:24:59.522
and you are paralyzed.

2337
01:24:59.522 --> 01:25:02.296
MICA: Cool, I love this, I'm so happy.

2338
01:25:02.296 --> 01:25:03.129
SAM: You know.

2339
01:25:03.129 --> 01:25:03.964
MATT: You know, like you do.

2340
01:25:03.964 --> 01:25:04.797
MICA: You know, like you do.

2341
01:25:04.797 --> 01:25:06.021
TRAVIS: I've got an item for that.

2342
01:25:06.021 --> 01:25:07.790
MATT: There it is.

2343
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:08.857
Paralyzed.

2344
01:25:08.857 --> 01:25:10.145
LAURA: Oh no.

2345
01:25:10.145 --> 01:25:14.462
MATT: You do take, in your scorpion form,

2346
01:25:14.462 --> 01:25:17.381
13 points of cold damage.

2347
01:25:17.381 --> 01:25:21.151
MICA: Oh, shit, yeah, you're right, I do.

2348
01:25:21.151 --> 01:25:23.494
MATT: The other yeti rushes forward,

2349
01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:25.722
now angry at both what you did

2350
01:25:25.722 --> 01:25:28.313
and the creature that now you've turned into before,

2351
01:25:28.313 --> 01:25:31.695
it's going to take two claw attacks against you.

2352
01:25:31.695 --> 01:25:34.327
Which have advantage because you are paralyzed.

2353
01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:37.603
That's going to be a 20 to hit, does that hit your--

2354
01:25:37.603 --> 01:25:38.436
MICA: It does.

2355
01:25:38.436 --> 01:25:41.738
MATT: All right, and the second hit's going to be 13 to hit.

2356
01:25:41.738 --> 01:25:42.692
MICA: Does not hit.

2357
01:25:42.692 --> 01:25:43.822
MATT: What's the scorpion's armor class?

2358
01:25:43.822 --> 01:25:44.655
MICA: 15.

2359
01:25:44.655 --> 01:25:45.488
MATT: Nice.

2360
01:25:45.488 --> 01:25:46.653
So yeah, the second one misses entirely.

2361
01:25:46.653 --> 01:25:48.492
It rolled really low on the advantaged one.

2362
01:25:48.492 --> 01:25:50.587
So the first strike, since you are paralyzed,

2363
01:25:50.587 --> 01:25:52.812
is an automatic crit.

2364
01:25:52.812 --> 01:25:55.596
So you do take--
TALIESIN: Um! (babbling)

2365
01:25:55.596 --> 01:25:56.602
Can I do a thing?

2366
01:25:56.602 --> 01:25:57.855
Am I not close enough?
MATT: You are not within 30 feet.

2367
01:25:57.855 --> 01:25:59.154
TALIESIN: I'm not within 30 feet, nevermind.

2368
01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.631
Goddamn it.

2369
01:26:00.631 --> 01:26:02.746
Boo.
MICA: It's all right.

2370
01:26:02.746 --> 01:26:05.477
TALIESIN: I know.
MICA: I'm okay.

2371
01:26:05.477 --> 01:26:06.774
MATT: You take 12 points of damage.

2372
01:26:06.774 --> 01:26:09.016
MICA: Oh, that's not bad.

2373
01:26:09.908 --> 01:26:11.315
MATT: Not too bad on that there.

2374
01:26:11.315 --> 01:26:12.531
MICA: I'm still fine.

2375
01:26:12.531 --> 01:26:14.516
MATT: That ends their go, Caduceus, you're up.

2376
01:26:14.516 --> 01:26:18.220
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and skirt

2377
01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:22.862
as close as I can to seeing what's up.

2378
01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:26.567
Can I get on that little edge that's on the corner there?

2379
01:26:26.567 --> 01:26:27.492
MATT: Right here?

2380
01:26:27.492 --> 01:26:29.495
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't think I want
to be quite in the realm of--

2381
01:26:29.495 --> 01:26:30.546
MATT: You can get there.

2382
01:26:30.546 --> 01:26:32.022
TALIESIN: That'll do.

2383
01:26:32.022 --> 01:26:33.470
MATT: With your movement, that's as far as you can get.

2384
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:36.441
TALIESIN: That's fine, there's so much happening here,

2385
01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:40.191
I'm just going to use Bless on

2386
01:26:41.432 --> 01:26:44.466
Caleb, Nott, and the scorpion.

2387
01:26:44.466 --> 01:26:45.632
MATT: Okay.

2388
01:26:45.632 --> 01:26:47.476
MICA: Reani's no longer Reani, Reani's just The Scorpion.

2389
01:26:47.476 --> 01:26:48.830
SAM: Are we blessed?

2390
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:50.179
TALIESIN: You're blessed.

2391
01:26:50.179 --> 01:26:51.908
MICA: Does the blessing remove paralysis?

2392
01:26:51.908 --> 01:26:53.875
TALIESIN: No, but when you roll your save,

2393
01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.386
you get to add a d4 to it.

2394
01:26:55.386 --> 01:26:57.044
SAM: Nice.
MATT: Which is nice.

2395
01:26:57.044 --> 01:26:58.660
All right, is that your turn, Caduceus?

2396
01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:01.310
TALIESIN: Yeah, my bonus actions are bullshit.

2397
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:02.424
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

2398
01:27:02.424 --> 01:27:03.623
TRAVIS: Yes, I am.

2399
01:27:03.623 --> 01:27:05.807
MATT: The dome has vanished now,

2400
01:27:05.807 --> 01:27:07.074
your friend has turned into scorpion.

2401
01:27:07.074 --> 01:27:08.238
MICA: Hello.

2402
01:27:08.238 --> 01:27:10.529
TRAVIS: Uh. (stuttering)

2403
01:27:10.529 --> 01:27:12.341
Yes, I will--

2404
01:27:15.119 --> 01:27:18.376
I am not going to do, nope, yes.

2405
01:27:18.376 --> 01:27:20.984
I will use 30 feet.

2406
01:27:20.984 --> 01:27:22.996
Five, 10, 15.

2407
01:27:22.996 --> 01:27:25.288
MATT: Five, 10, right there.

2408
01:27:25.288 --> 01:27:27.946
So climb a bit, you have 20 feet of movement.

2409
01:27:27.946 --> 01:27:30.929
TRAVIS: I think I'll use another 10 feet

2410
01:27:30.929 --> 01:27:33.110
just to come up so I can get eyes on that first--

2411
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:34.604
MATT: Yep, you do have a view of it there

2412
01:27:34.604 --> 01:27:36.463
between the edge of the cave and the mountainside

2413
01:27:36.463 --> 01:27:37.832
and where the scorpion is.

2414
01:27:37.832 --> 01:27:41.250
TRAVIS: And I'll use the Glove of Blasting!

2415
01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:42.501
(laughter)

2416
01:27:42.501 --> 01:27:43.334
MATT: All righty.

2417
01:27:43.334 --> 01:27:44.513
SAM: (British accent) Eldritch Blast!

2418
01:27:44.513 --> 01:27:46.004
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, yes.

2419
01:27:46.004 --> 01:27:48.144
(laughter)

2420
01:27:48.144 --> 01:27:48.977
19.

2421
01:27:48.977 --> 01:27:51.502
MATT: That hits. Second one.

2422
01:27:51.502 --> 01:27:52.638
TRAVIS: Is an 11?

2423
01:27:52.638 --> 01:27:53.888
MATT: 11 misses.

2424
01:27:53.888 --> 01:27:56.204
TRAVIS: Okay, and the third one is a 28.

2425
01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:58.767
MATT: Yes, so that's two hits out of three.

2426
01:27:58.767 --> 01:28:01.096
So 4d6 fire damage.

2427
01:28:01.096 --> 01:28:02.677
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2428
01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:04.385
4d6?

2429
01:28:04.385 --> 01:28:05.525
I thought it was like 2d6.

2430
01:28:05.525 --> 01:28:07.149
MATT: It's 2d6 per hit.

2431
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:08.837
TRAVIS: 2d6 per hit, okay great.

2432
01:28:08.837 --> 01:28:13.520
So that's seven, sorry, 18,

2433
01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.586
and five more for 20.

2434
01:28:15.586 --> 01:28:17.643
20 points of fire damage.

2435
01:28:19.851 --> 01:28:21.751
MATT: (roaring)

2436
01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:24.039
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

2437
01:28:24.039 --> 01:28:25.960
MATT: But it felt good to fire something out of your hand.

2438
01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:29.052
TALIESIN: Did it seem like the fire, like bad,

2439
01:28:29.052 --> 01:28:30.033
it seemed like it really didn't--

2440
01:28:30.033 --> 01:28:31.019
TRAVIS: Fire bad!

2441
01:28:31.019 --> 01:28:33.565
(laughter)

2442
01:28:33.565 --> 01:28:37.009
MATT: You have a not quite a quick glance,

2443
01:28:37.009 --> 01:28:39.323
however you do see, and Reani, you do see

2444
01:28:39.323 --> 01:28:41.699
as the fire hits it, its eyes do light up

2445
01:28:41.699 --> 01:28:44.437
and it starts going like (scared grunting).

2446
01:28:44.437 --> 01:28:45.587
The flames are still curling up

2447
01:28:45.587 --> 01:28:47.908
and burning away the fur. It looks like it's

2448
01:28:47.908 --> 01:28:49.890
really put off guard by the flames.

2449
01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:51.616
TRAVIS: Fire is good, fire is good!

2450
01:28:51.616 --> 01:28:52.928
SAM: Fire good.

2451
01:28:52.928 --> 01:28:54.543
MATT: All right, that finishes your go, Fjord?

2452
01:28:54.543 --> 01:28:55.660
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: Jester, you're up.

2453
01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:56.836
LAURA: Oh.

2454
01:28:56.836 --> 01:28:58.138
Okay.

2455
01:28:58.138 --> 01:29:00.719
I'm going to send my duplicate up,

2456
01:29:00.719 --> 01:29:02.517
and I'm assuming she doesn't have to actually

2457
01:29:02.517 --> 01:29:04.613
make acrobatics checks to climb, she can just move.

2458
01:29:04.613 --> 01:29:06.035
120 feet up.

2459
01:29:06.035 --> 01:29:07.251
MATT: 120 feet?

2460
01:29:07.251 --> 01:29:08.308
Can she move that far?

2461
01:29:08.308 --> 01:29:09.141
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: That's awesome!

2462
01:29:09.141 --> 01:29:10.428
Duplicate can move within--

2463
01:29:10.428 --> 01:29:13.011
Yeah, move all, she's like wee!

2464
01:29:14.018 --> 01:29:16.138
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, hold on, let me double-check.

2465
01:29:16.138 --> 01:29:17.564
MICA: This shimmery Jester like doing flips in the air.

2466
01:29:17.564 --> 01:29:19.298
LAURA: I think I have to keep her within 120 feet of me,

2467
01:29:19.298 --> 01:29:20.817
maybe she can only move 30 feet.

2468
01:29:20.817 --> 01:29:24.313
She can only move 30 feet, I'm a liar.

2469
01:29:24.313 --> 01:29:27.544
MATT: 15, 20, 25, I'll let her go up to there,

2470
01:29:27.544 --> 01:29:29.384
because she can just like, float diagonally,

2471
01:29:29.384 --> 01:29:31.397
she's not burdened by gravity.

2472
01:29:31.397 --> 01:29:33.609
LAURA: Okay, so she can't actually get up next to them.

2473
01:29:33.609 --> 01:29:35.010
MATT: No.

2474
01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:37.250
LAURA: Is she within, okay.

2475
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:39.697
Then I'm going to, with that--

2476
01:29:39.697 --> 01:29:41.281
MATT: Plus, you don't have visual on them,

2477
01:29:41.281 --> 01:29:43.296
so you couldn't even cast anything through her

2478
01:29:43.296 --> 01:29:45.016
on something if you couldn't see them.

2479
01:29:45.016 --> 01:29:48.294
LAURA: Then I'm going to climb up as Jester.

2480
01:29:48.294 --> 01:29:50.610
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: For my movement.

2481
01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:51.673
Can I see them now?

2482
01:29:51.673 --> 01:29:55.738
MATT: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, you can if you get right there.

2483
01:29:55.738 --> 01:29:58.718
LAURA: Oh, god, would I be able to just climb to like,

2484
01:29:58.718 --> 01:30:00.633
right here and peek my head up so I could get--

2485
01:30:00.633 --> 01:30:02.360
MATT: Unfortunately no, it's too high.

2486
01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.458
LAURA: Okay.

2487
01:30:03.458 --> 01:30:05.208
MATT: So you want to head over there?

2488
01:30:05.208 --> 01:30:06.962
TALIESIN: I feel like we're clumping.
MATT: It's up to you.

2489
01:30:06.962 --> 01:30:07.923
LAURA: We are definitely--

2490
01:30:07.923 --> 01:30:09.166
MICA: It's a doggy pile, it's fine.

2491
01:30:09.166 --> 01:30:10.973
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

2492
01:30:10.973 --> 01:30:13.244
LAURA: Definitely clumped.
TALIESIN: Thank you, Matt.

2493
01:30:14.227 --> 01:30:16.202
I hate it when you say these things.

2494
01:30:16.202 --> 01:30:19.194
MICA: The wink made it more disturbing.
TALIESIN: I know, it's so bad.

2495
01:30:19.194 --> 01:30:20.342
This is awful.

2496
01:30:20.342 --> 01:30:21.332
TALIESIN: It makes my tummy rumble.

2497
01:30:21.332 --> 01:30:25.109
LAURA: Okay, well, that takes some of my choices out.

2498
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:28.404
I'm going to--
TALIESIN: It's not happy.

2499
01:30:28.404 --> 01:30:29.758
MATT: It's okay, you have wiped out half

2500
01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:32.289
of the current threat in the first round, so.

2501
01:30:32.289 --> 01:30:33.342
LAURA: Yeah.

2502
01:30:33.342 --> 01:30:35.717
MATT: Can't all be sunshine and roses.

2503
01:30:35.717 --> 01:30:38.667
LAURA: Okay, no, that's concentration,

2504
01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:39.775
and that is also concen--

2505
01:30:39.775 --> 01:30:44.569
wait, is my, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I've never done this.

2506
01:30:44.569 --> 01:30:47.038
SAM: Never played D&amp;D before.

2507
01:30:47.038 --> 01:30:49.535
LAURA: I never concentrate on a spell. Okay, okay, okay.

2508
01:30:49.535 --> 01:30:52.360
As a spell, I'm going to cast

2509
01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.476
Guiding Bolt at level four

2510
01:30:55.476 --> 01:30:57.631
at the guy in the front.

2511
01:30:57.631 --> 01:30:59.355
MATT: Right there, okay, roll for an attack.

2512
01:30:59.355 --> 01:31:02.285
MARISHA: Vogue.
MATT: And Nott, you're on deck.

2513
01:31:02.285 --> 01:31:03.682
LAURA: 15 plus nine.

2514
01:31:03.682 --> 01:31:05.167
MATT: That definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2515
01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:08.742
LAURA: So that is Guiding Bolt, 7d6.

2516
01:31:08.742 --> 01:31:09.908
MICA: Yikes.

2517
01:31:09.908 --> 01:31:12.004
SAM: 76 points of damage.

2518
01:31:12.004 --> 01:31:13.254
MICA: 76, yeah.

2519
01:31:17.538 --> 01:31:18.706
LAURA: Ooh.

2520
01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:20.114
12.

2521
01:31:21.251 --> 01:31:23.768
14, 17.

2522
01:31:23.768 --> 01:31:26.418
18, 20, 24 points.

2523
01:31:26.418 --> 01:31:27.546
MATT: 24 points.

2524
01:31:27.546 --> 01:31:30.076
LAURA: Then the next attack is at advantage.

2525
01:31:30.076 --> 01:31:32.710
MATT: It's a very, very shiny falling corpse

2526
01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:35.567
as you blast it in the front of its neck and chest area,

2527
01:31:35.567 --> 01:31:39.994
where the fire is burning and now there's a concave area

2528
01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:41.788
where the flesh has been punctured inward,

2529
01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:44.746
and it like, tries to breathe for a second

2530
01:31:44.746 --> 01:31:47.796
before grabbing out, putting one claw on the front

2531
01:31:47.796 --> 01:31:50.030
of the scorpion and then falling forward

2532
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:54.359
and it falls limp, its hand scraping off of its armor.

2533
01:31:54.359 --> 01:31:56.406
MICA: If I wasn't paralyzed, I'd be disgusted.

2534
01:31:56.406 --> 01:31:57.419
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

2535
01:31:57.419 --> 01:31:58.760
MICA: Like: Eh.

2536
01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:00.809
TALIESIN: I want to see a scorpion go, "Gross."

2537
01:32:00.809 --> 01:32:01.892
MARISHA: Yeah.

2538
01:32:01.892 --> 01:32:03.461
MATT: Nott, your turn.

2539
01:32:03.461 --> 01:32:05.777
SAM: There's one more live yeti?

2540
01:32:05.777 --> 01:32:06.765
MATT: There is.

2541
01:32:06.765 --> 01:32:09.730
LAURA: Out right now.

2542
01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:12.434
SAM: And he can't see me or I can't see him?

2543
01:32:12.434 --> 01:32:13.714
MATT: You're not hidden.

2544
01:32:13.714 --> 01:32:15.499
He saw you before and saw you run behind,

2545
01:32:15.499 --> 01:32:16.639
but you're not currently hidden.

2546
01:32:16.639 --> 01:32:18.302
SAM: I'm not currently hidden, but I could be,

2547
01:32:18.302 --> 01:32:20.710
if I bonus action hide right now.

2548
01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:21.655
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

2549
01:32:21.655 --> 01:32:23.575
SAM: All right, I will bonus action hide,

2550
01:32:23.575 --> 01:32:25.898
tucking in to the rocks.

2551
01:32:25.898 --> 01:32:27.019
27.

2552
01:32:27.019 --> 01:32:28.285
MATT: 27, sure.

2553
01:32:28.285 --> 01:32:32.759
SAM: And then I will attack.

2554
01:32:32.759 --> 01:32:34.816
MATT: Okay, so you dart out this way to do so?

2555
01:32:34.816 --> 01:32:36.997
SAM: I mean, I don't know how this works,

2556
01:32:36.997 --> 01:32:39.805
so I have to hide but then expose myself to shoot?

2557
01:32:39.805 --> 01:32:40.885
MATT: Kind of.
SAM: How does it work?

2558
01:32:40.885 --> 01:32:42.683
LAURA: Then you might get sneak attack, at least.

2559
01:32:42.683 --> 01:32:45.911
SAM: Yeah, but will that negate the hide, or will it--

2560
01:32:45.911 --> 01:32:48.287
MATT: No no no, the idea is essentially

2561
01:32:48.287 --> 01:32:49.876
you're firing as you go out that way.

2562
01:32:49.876 --> 01:32:51.247
SAM: Okay.

2563
01:32:51.247 --> 01:32:52.832
Okay, so you'll allow this?

2564
01:32:52.832 --> 01:32:54.348
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Okay, all right, so I shoot.

2565
01:32:54.348 --> 01:32:56.324
Ew, 13.

2566
01:32:56.324 --> 01:32:57.157
MATT: 13 hits.

2567
01:32:57.157 --> 01:32:58.061
(gasping)

2568
01:32:58.061 --> 01:32:59.369
SAM: Wow.

2569
01:32:59.369 --> 01:33:00.435
MICA: It's a big chungus.

2570
01:33:00.435 --> 01:33:02.294
SAM: Sneak attack.

2571
01:33:02.294 --> 01:33:04.656
LAURA: See, this is an occasion that you should've

2572
01:33:04.656 --> 01:33:07.597
shaken them instead of just doing what you did.

2573
01:33:07.597 --> 01:33:08.831
SAM: 23 points.

2574
01:33:08.831 --> 01:33:11.193
LAURA: His rolls are like--

2575
01:33:11.193 --> 01:33:12.931
Come on.

2576
01:33:12.931 --> 01:33:14.655
SAM: That's all I can do.

2577
01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:16.581
Except we are clumped, so I'll use

2578
01:33:16.581 --> 01:33:18.205
any remaining movement I have to go

2579
01:33:18.205 --> 01:33:21.171
to that other rock formation across the way.

2580
01:33:21.171 --> 01:33:22.004
MATT: Over here?

2581
01:33:22.004 --> 01:33:23.523
SAM: Yeah.

2582
01:33:23.523 --> 01:33:25.984
TALIESIN: Who has the ingot, by the way, at the moment?

2583
01:33:25.984 --> 01:33:27.402
MATT: Right there.

2584
01:33:27.402 --> 01:33:28.533
LAURA: Fjord.

2585
01:33:28.533 --> 01:33:31.093
MATT: All right, that finishes Nott's turn. Beau, you're up.

2586
01:33:31.093 --> 01:33:32.129
TALIESIN: The reason for the season.

2587
01:33:32.129 --> 01:33:33.896
SAM: Oh, I have Bless. What does Bless do?

2588
01:33:33.896 --> 01:33:35.524
TALIESIN: You add a d4 to your attack.

2589
01:33:35.524 --> 01:33:36.686
SAM: I hit anyway.

2590
01:33:36.686 --> 01:33:40.512
MARISHA: I pick up the TalkBack.

2591
01:33:40.512 --> 01:33:42.255
(laughter)

2592
01:33:42.255 --> 01:33:43.582
Because I said I was going to do it.

2593
01:33:43.582 --> 01:33:45.183
SAM: The TalkBack button?

2594
01:33:45.183 --> 01:33:47.274
MATT: You hear the roaring and screams

2595
01:33:47.274 --> 01:33:48.918
and combat up top of the mountain.

2596
01:33:48.918 --> 01:33:51.116
MARISHA: Jester, I got it.

2597
01:33:53.781 --> 01:33:55.737
I go up. (laughs)

2598
01:33:55.737 --> 01:33:59.131
MATT: Okay, so that's 10, 15, 20, 25.

2599
01:33:59.131 --> 01:34:01.591
MARISHA: Acrobatics.

2600
01:34:01.591 --> 01:34:03.026
SAM and MARISHA: Parkour.

2601
01:34:03.026 --> 01:34:05.083
LAURA: Hardcore parkour.

2602
01:34:06.958 --> 01:34:08.620
Athletics usually-- it's a climbing check

2603
01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:11.203
for these things if you want to try and push up.

2604
01:34:11.203 --> 01:34:12.351
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: It's fine,

2605
01:34:12.351 --> 01:34:13.901
it's just hard to go up there.

2606
01:34:13.901 --> 01:34:14.734
MARISHA: Yeah.

2607
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:18.840
MATT: It's also snow and ice-covered rocks.

2608
01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.118
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2609
01:34:20.118 --> 01:34:21.333
In the middle of a storm.

2610
01:34:21.333 --> 01:34:25.067
MARISHA: But I'm a monk and I can walk on water, so--

2611
01:34:25.067 --> 01:34:27.243
MATT: Frozen water's different.

2612
01:34:27.243 --> 01:34:29.010
SAM: But Matt, she said parkour.
MATT: Roll an acrobatics check

2613
01:34:29.010 --> 01:34:31.131
with disadvantage.

2614
01:34:31.131 --> 01:34:32.750
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2615
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:34.741
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

2616
01:34:34.741 --> 01:34:37.209
MICA: Damn, you mess with the DM, you get the teeth.

2617
01:34:37.209 --> 01:34:38.446
MARISHA: Ooh!

2618
01:34:38.446 --> 01:34:40.569
LAURA: Did you roll a one, did you roll a one?!

2619
01:34:40.569 --> 01:34:41.903
MARISHA: 19 and a one.

2620
01:34:41.903 --> 01:34:43.038
LAURA: Oh no!

2621
01:34:43.038 --> 01:34:45.371
TRAVIS: You had to talk that shit!

2622
01:34:45.371 --> 01:34:46.796
MATT: So.

2623
01:34:46.796 --> 01:34:48.341
(laughter)

2624
01:34:48.341 --> 01:34:49.285
TALIESIN: I am so excited.

2625
01:34:49.285 --> 01:34:50.627
MATT: Sometimes the haggle works in your favor,

2626
01:34:50.627 --> 01:34:52.219
sometimes it doesn't.

2627
01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:54.415
In an attempt to get to the top of the mountain

2628
01:34:54.415 --> 01:34:56.305
without losing movement, you rush up,

2629
01:34:56.305 --> 01:34:59.352
and as you're partway up, you barely see above the edge

2630
01:34:59.352 --> 01:35:02.342
where your friends are. As your foot hits one edge

2631
01:35:02.342 --> 01:35:04.046
where your momentum's been building,

2632
01:35:04.046 --> 01:35:06.900
and your foot hits smooth ice.

2633
01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:07.816
TRAVIS: Hey, Beau.

2634
01:35:07.816 --> 01:35:09.668
MATT: Goes out, you watch her like bob up

2635
01:35:09.668 --> 01:35:11.610
and then tumble back down.

2636
01:35:13.768 --> 01:35:15.594
TRAVIS: Home Alone style.

2637
01:35:15.594 --> 01:35:18.565
MATT: Landing prone on the stone

2638
01:35:18.565 --> 01:35:20.227
TALIESIN: On dead yeti.

2639
01:35:20.227 --> 01:35:21.430
MICA: Yeah.

2640
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:24.218
MATT: You do have Slow Fall, so you do manage to like

2641
01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:27.403
reach out into the snow and the rock, and I'll say you--

2642
01:35:27.403 --> 01:35:31.537
TRAVIS: Snap your forearm in the process.
MARISHA: Just knocks the air out of me.

2643
01:35:31.537 --> 01:35:33.011
MATT: No, you have Slow Fall, so.

2644
01:35:33.011 --> 01:35:34.017
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, oh.

2645
01:35:34.017 --> 01:35:36.106
MATT: But no, this is less the fall impact

2646
01:35:36.106 --> 01:35:38.524
and this is more the stone, hitting stone.

2647
01:35:38.524 --> 01:35:40.048
You take six points of bludgeoning damage.

2648
01:35:40.048 --> 01:35:42.076
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.
I imagine just seeing a top knot

2649
01:35:42.076 --> 01:35:44.717
and then the top knot disappears, yeah. (laughter)

2650
01:35:44.717 --> 01:35:47.634
TALIESIN: Who was that mysterious top knot?

2651
01:35:51.224 --> 01:35:52.057
Anyone who's had to live through--

2652
01:35:52.057 --> 01:35:55.231
MATT: So that's your movement, you're prone on the ground.

2653
01:35:55.231 --> 01:35:56.932
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

2654
01:35:56.932 --> 01:35:58.080
MATT: Sorry.

2655
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.923
TRAVIS: "Sorry."

2656
01:35:59.923 --> 01:36:04.108
MICA: He says sorry with a giant grin on his face.

2657
01:36:04.108 --> 01:36:07.254
MARISHA: It's okay, I'm two characters today.

2658
01:36:07.254 --> 01:36:08.908
MATT: That's true.

2659
01:36:08.908 --> 01:36:11.059
LIAM: Save it for Caleb.

2660
01:36:11.059 --> 01:36:13.254
MARISHA: I will stand up and keep trying

2661
01:36:13.254 --> 01:36:15.329
to go up the fucking mountain.

2662
01:36:15.329 --> 01:36:17.036
MATT: Okay, well you don't have any more movement,

2663
01:36:17.036 --> 01:36:18.737
so you have to use Step of the Wind to do so.

2664
01:36:18.737 --> 01:36:20.187
MARISHA: I have my action, I haven't--

2665
01:36:20.187 --> 01:36:21.671
MATT: Oh that's right, with your action you can, yes.

2666
01:36:21.671 --> 01:36:23.452
So you can burn your action to move.

2667
01:36:23.452 --> 01:36:25.223
So you've got 20 feet left?

2668
01:36:25.223 --> 01:36:26.861
TRAVIS: Please eat shit again.

2669
01:36:26.861 --> 01:36:29.260
MATT: 15, 20, that's as far as you get with your movement.

2670
01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:30.574
TRAVIS: We're just missing Macaulay Culkin to make this--

2671
01:36:30.574 --> 01:36:31.424
LAURA: Yeah, but you can see.

2672
01:36:31.424 --> 01:36:32.265
MATT: You can see.

2673
01:36:32.265 --> 01:36:33.279
Now you have a view.

2674
01:36:33.279 --> 01:36:36.095
There's a dead yeti on the ground.

2675
01:36:36.095 --> 01:36:38.492
You can see like burnt, blackened fur

2676
01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:40.876
all around its neck and head, it's face down in the snow.

2677
01:36:40.876 --> 01:36:42.792
Behind it's one that looks partially wounded

2678
01:36:42.792 --> 01:36:44.499
that's roaring and turning around

2679
01:36:44.499 --> 01:36:48.415
while there's a giant scorpion just locked in place.

2680
01:36:48.415 --> 01:36:49.970
MARISHA: Dope.

2681
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.710
MATT: All right, ending Beau's turn, Reani, you're up.

2682
01:36:52.710 --> 01:36:55.323
You're paralyzed, make a saving throw.

2683
01:36:55.323 --> 01:36:57.604
MICA: I guess we'll add a d4, add a d4?

2684
01:36:57.604 --> 01:36:58.530
MATT: Add a d4 to it.

2685
01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:00.363
LAURA: Woo.

2686
01:37:00.363 --> 01:37:03.392
MICA: That's 18, 19, 20.

2687
01:37:03.392 --> 01:37:05.612
MATT: Yeah, you manage to shrug off the paralysis effect.

2688
01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:07.564
LAURA: Yes.
MICA: Fuck yeah.

2689
01:37:07.564 --> 01:37:09.197
I'm fine.

2690
01:37:10.082 --> 01:37:13.647
So as a giant scorpion, I have three attacks.

2691
01:37:13.647 --> 01:37:16.505
I would like to claw, claw, sting.

2692
01:37:16.505 --> 01:37:18.266
MATT: It says at the end of each of its turns,

2693
01:37:18.266 --> 01:37:20.418
but I'll allow it, why not.

2694
01:37:20.418 --> 01:37:22.422
MICA: I'll allow it, you'll allow it?

2695
01:37:22.422 --> 01:37:23.908
MATT: Go for it.
MICA: It says multi-attack.

2696
01:37:23.908 --> 01:37:24.944
MATT: I know, go for it.

2697
01:37:24.944 --> 01:37:27.964
I'll let you do it.
MICA: Yay, okay.

2698
01:37:27.964 --> 01:37:31.628
So first is a 16 to hit?

2699
01:37:31.628 --> 01:37:33.182
MATT: That hits.
MICA: That hits?

2700
01:37:33.182 --> 01:37:35.844
Second is a, that hits, it's a 17 plus four.

2701
01:37:35.844 --> 01:37:37.266
MATT: That hits.
MICA: That hits.

2702
01:37:37.266 --> 01:37:41.166
Then, probably not, that's three,

2703
01:37:41.166 --> 01:37:42.891
four, five, six, seven, seven.

2704
01:37:42.891 --> 01:37:44.215
MATT: That does not hit, unfortunately.

2705
01:37:44.215 --> 01:37:46.244
MICA: Okay, so the two claws, that hits.

2706
01:37:46.244 --> 01:37:49.735
So that's only 1d8 plus two.

2707
01:37:50.766 --> 01:37:51.933
Here they are.

2708
01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:54.911
Oh, yikes.

2709
01:37:57.807 --> 01:38:00.046
Nine, nine points of claw damage.

2710
01:38:00.046 --> 01:38:01.756
Oh, it's also grappled.

2711
01:38:01.756 --> 01:38:03.499
MATT: And it's grappled, okay.
MICA: Yeah.

2712
01:38:03.499 --> 01:38:05.108
TALIESIN: That's excellent.
MICA: Yeah.

2713
01:38:05.108 --> 01:38:07.377
TRAVIS: In your pincers?
MICA: In my pincers.

2714
01:38:07.377 --> 01:38:09.649
MATT: The tail misses as it manages to pull out of the way,

2715
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:12.697
but you are now holding it in place so it cannot move.

2716
01:38:12.697 --> 01:38:14.526
All right, that finishes your turn?

2717
01:38:14.526 --> 01:38:16.472
MICA: Yes, but as a bonus action, I want to hiss at it.

2718
01:38:16.472 --> 01:38:17.305
MATT: Go for it.

2719
01:38:17.305 --> 01:38:18.138
MICA: (hisses)

2720
01:38:18.138 --> 01:38:19.099
MATT: Well done.
MICA: That's it, thank you.

2721
01:38:19.099 --> 01:38:21.199
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

2722
01:38:21.199 --> 01:38:26.158
MARISHA: (as Caleb) <i>Ja</i>, I'm going to move forward.

2723
01:38:27.197 --> 01:38:29.132
MATT: To there?

2724
01:38:29.132 --> 01:38:29.965
MARISHA: <i>Ja.</i>

2725
01:38:29.965 --> 01:38:30.798
TRAVIS: We're leaving tracks,

2726
01:38:30.798 --> 01:38:32.201
that's awesome.
MARISHA: He's looking pretty--

2727
01:38:32.201 --> 01:38:33.601
pretty rough I'm assuming, right?

2728
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:35.384
MATT: He's not looking great.

2729
01:38:35.384 --> 01:38:37.803
TRAVIS: <i>Ja</i>, get close and do something with your hands.

2730
01:38:37.803 --> 01:38:42.283
MARISHA: I'm going to do exactly that, Fee-yor-dih.

2731
01:38:42.283 --> 01:38:45.238
(laughter)

2732
01:38:45.238 --> 01:38:49.108
I'm going to move around and I'm going to--

2733
01:38:49.108 --> 01:38:50.424
TRAVIS: Is there a medic over here?

2734
01:38:50.424 --> 01:38:52.441
She's going to implode.

2735
01:38:52.441 --> 01:38:53.562
MARISHA: Is that my movement?

2736
01:38:53.562 --> 01:38:54.872
MATT: No, you can move further if you want to.

2737
01:38:54.872 --> 01:38:58.519
MARISHA: Can I move forward a little bit
closer to the scorpion?

2738
01:38:58.519 --> 01:39:01.698
MATT: There you can, right there.

2739
01:39:01.698 --> 01:39:02.964
MARISHA: Burning Hands.

2740
01:39:02.964 --> 01:39:04.009
MATT: Okay.

2741
01:39:04.009 --> 01:39:05.811
Over this way?

2742
01:39:05.811 --> 01:39:06.752
MARISHA: Yeah.

2743
01:39:06.752 --> 01:39:08.811
To try and not get the scorpion.

2744
01:39:08.811 --> 01:39:12.559
MATT: 15-foot, yeah, you can definitely do that.

2745
01:39:12.559 --> 01:39:14.550
TRAVIS: Boosh.

2746
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:17.113
What the fuck is Burning Hands?

2747
01:39:17.113 --> 01:39:19.377
TALIESIN: Burning Hands is a festival that they have, sorry.

2748
01:39:19.377 --> 01:39:20.716
(laughter)

2749
01:39:20.716 --> 01:39:24.445
MATT: All right, so that's 3d6 fire damage.

2750
01:39:24.445 --> 01:39:26.409
Dexterity save.

2751
01:39:26.409 --> 01:39:28.266
TRAVIS: Burning Hands and Traveler Con.

2752
01:39:28.266 --> 01:39:31.288
MATT: 13, I do not thinks that makes his DC.
MARISHA: Fail.

2753
01:39:31.288 --> 01:39:32.846
Ooh, ooh!

2754
01:39:32.846 --> 01:39:33.835
13.

2755
01:39:33.835 --> 01:39:36.235
MATT: 13 points of--
MARISHA: Fire damage.

2756
01:39:36.235 --> 01:39:37.404
LAURA: Matthew.

2757
01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:38.678
MATT: Nice.

2758
01:39:38.678 --> 01:39:40.114
LAURA: Fjord fell from the mountain and--

2759
01:39:40.114 --> 01:39:42.325
MATT: Oh, that's it, it's done, sorry Fjord.

2760
01:39:42.325 --> 01:39:43.392
MICA: Fjord died.

2761
01:39:43.392 --> 01:39:46.814
MATT: Okay, thank you for the heads up on that.

2762
01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:51.814
So the body of the already dead yeti is just immolated.

2763
01:39:52.617 --> 01:39:54.878
It's now burning, the other one, the flames

2764
01:39:54.878 --> 01:39:56.693
lick the front of its face and its chest,

2765
01:39:56.693 --> 01:39:58.152
there's fire now across its shoulders

2766
01:39:58.152 --> 01:40:01.080
and it's trying to pull back, but it's currently

2767
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:05.439
caught in the pincers of the scorpion, it's like (roaring).

2768
01:40:05.439 --> 01:40:07.544
LAURA: Oh god.
MATT: It looks pretty rough. (laughs)

2769
01:40:07.544 --> 01:40:09.948
SAM: Feel bad for these things.
LAURA: I know, I do too.

2770
01:40:09.948 --> 01:40:14.931
MARISHA: I don't know what else to do.

2771
01:40:15.923 --> 01:40:18.056
MATT: That's your action and your move.

2772
01:40:18.056 --> 01:40:19.426
MARISHA: I did the thing.

2773
01:40:19.426 --> 01:40:20.963
MATT: All righty, it's now the yeti's turn.

2774
01:40:20.963 --> 01:40:22.447
Can't get away since it's grappled,

2775
01:40:22.447 --> 01:40:24.810
it's going to attempt to its attacks against you.

2776
01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:25.947
MICA: That's fine.

2777
01:40:25.947 --> 01:40:27.288
MATT: However, it has disadvantage on them

2778
01:40:27.288 --> 01:40:29.359
because it was hit by fire.

2779
01:40:29.359 --> 01:40:31.259
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

2780
01:40:32.343 --> 01:40:33.387
MARISHA: <i>Ja</i>, I knew that.

2781
01:40:33.387 --> 01:40:36.249
That's going to be a natural one.

2782
01:40:36.249 --> 01:40:37.799
(laughter)

2783
01:40:37.799 --> 01:40:38.859
MICA: Does it punch itself in the face?

2784
01:40:38.859 --> 01:40:39.750
LAURA: I know, right?

2785
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:40.583
MATT: Yeah, both miss.

2786
01:40:40.583 --> 01:40:42.957
The first swing goes towards you

2787
01:40:42.957 --> 01:40:46.075
and as it goes down, your claw actually grabs it

2788
01:40:46.075 --> 01:40:49.899
and squeeze and you hear the wrist snap,

2789
01:40:49.899 --> 01:40:52.233
it goes (grunting).

2790
01:40:52.233 --> 01:40:54.382
LAURA: Oh no, I feel bad.
MATT: It's now held in the other claw

2791
01:40:54.382 --> 01:40:56.374
and jams down and hits the top of the head

2792
01:40:56.374 --> 01:40:58.676
like near where the eyes are, but as it pulls back,

2793
01:40:58.676 --> 01:41:00.888
you manage to withdraw the head slightly

2794
01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:03.235
into the armor a bit, and it just completely misses

2795
01:41:03.235 --> 01:41:05.856
anything of value, just scrapes across the outside

2796
01:41:05.856 --> 01:41:07.087
of the scorpion's armor.

2797
01:41:07.087 --> 01:41:08.771
No effect.

2798
01:41:08.771 --> 01:41:10.685
All right, that finishes that turn, Caduceus, you're up.

2799
01:41:10.685 --> 01:41:12.991
TALIESIN: I'm just going to step up a little bit,

2800
01:41:12.991 --> 01:41:14.594
and just so I can get eyes on this thing,

2801
01:41:14.594 --> 01:41:18.095
and I'm just going to do some basic,

2802
01:41:18.095 --> 01:41:20.316
I feel like this is coming to an end.

2803
01:41:20.316 --> 01:41:21.730
Let's just Sacred Flame this thing.

2804
01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:22.979
MATT: Sure.

2805
01:41:22.979 --> 01:41:25.390
Dexterity check.

2806
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:27.354
That is a 15.
TALIESIN: Nope.

2807
01:41:27.354 --> 01:41:29.823
MATT: All right, so go ahead and do damage.

2808
01:41:29.823 --> 01:41:32.975
TALIESIN: That's 11 points of radiant flame damage.

2809
01:41:32.975 --> 01:41:35.600
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2810
01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.411
TALIESIN: I just see where it's going already

2811
01:41:37.411 --> 01:41:38.783
and I just start from the feet up

2812
01:41:38.783 --> 01:41:40.337
and I'm just going to roll it all way up

2813
01:41:40.337 --> 01:41:42.180
and just pull the whole furry thing.

2814
01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.315
MATT: The red burning fire atop meets the

2815
01:41:45.315 --> 01:41:48.996
yellow-gold burning sacred fire from underneath,

2816
01:41:48.996 --> 01:41:50.465
and as the two meet in the center,

2817
01:41:50.465 --> 01:41:53.931
the entire yeti is immolated in the claws of the scorpion.

2818
01:41:53.931 --> 01:41:55.619
TALIESIN: Shush, that's fine.

2819
01:41:55.619 --> 01:41:56.897
(laughter)

2820
01:41:56.897 --> 01:41:57.773
LAURA: Aww.

2821
01:41:57.773 --> 01:42:00.567
MATT: And it is no more.

2822
01:42:00.567 --> 01:42:02.825
LAURA: Does Caleb have to make a saving throw

2823
01:42:02.825 --> 01:42:03.658
so he doesn't--

2824
01:42:03.658 --> 01:42:05.274
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: -- have a thing.

2825
01:42:05.274 --> 01:42:06.340
MATT: He does.

2826
01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:07.437
SAM and TALIESIN: No, that's only if he kills with it.

2827
01:42:07.437 --> 01:42:08.673
MATT: Oh no, he didn't kill it, that's right.

2828
01:42:08.673 --> 01:42:10.623
He did not.

2829
01:42:10.623 --> 01:42:14.461
TALIESIN: Eyes on it, are more things coming?

2830
01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:16.302
I'll take the rest of my movement to back up

2831
01:42:16.302 --> 01:42:18.189
if they're still going to be coming in.

2832
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:19.495
SAM: Is there another one?

2833
01:42:19.495 --> 01:42:20.768
TALIESIN: I don't know.

2834
01:42:20.768 --> 01:42:21.601
I want to look.

2835
01:42:21.601 --> 01:42:23.141
MATT: Make a perception check.

2836
01:42:23.141 --> 01:42:26.693
At disadvantage, because it is in darkness.

2837
01:42:26.693 --> 01:42:29.093
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry) 12.

2838
01:42:29.093 --> 01:42:32.693
MATT: You see nothing beyond probably

2839
01:42:32.693 --> 01:42:35.443
20 feet into the cavern where the light ends.

2840
01:42:35.443 --> 01:42:38.889
MARISHA: Caleb will take out his globules

2841
01:42:38.889 --> 01:42:41.131
and send them down the cave.

2842
01:42:41.131 --> 01:42:42.387
MATT: All right, so as the light blobs--

2843
01:42:42.387 --> 01:42:45.231
MARISHA: Oh, don't judge my choices for my friend.

2844
01:42:45.231 --> 01:42:47.073
(laughter)

2845
01:42:47.073 --> 01:42:49.845
MATT: As the light globes drift inside the cavern,

2846
01:42:49.845 --> 01:42:52.149
light up the perimeter,

2847
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:55.803
a moment, two moments, a few moments pass,

2848
01:42:55.803 --> 01:42:58.777
and there are no yetis following up this band

2849
01:42:58.777 --> 01:43:02.974
of which you have destroyed at the mouth of the cave.

2850
01:43:02.974 --> 01:43:04.822
MARISHA: I bring the globules back.

2851
01:43:04.822 --> 01:43:07.054
SAM: Excellent choice.

2852
01:43:07.054 --> 01:43:09.331
TALIESIN: Do we want to sneak in here and maybe

2853
01:43:09.331 --> 01:43:11.272
take our rest in their camp?

2854
01:43:11.272 --> 01:43:13.435
LAURA: Yeah, it would be probably better.

2855
01:43:13.435 --> 01:43:15.034
MICA: Before we do that, I want to un-Wild Shape

2856
01:43:15.034 --> 01:43:17.109
and turn around and go: See, it was easy!

2857
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:18.477
SAM: You're totally right.

2858
01:43:18.477 --> 01:43:21.244
MARISHA: The scorpion form is awesome.

2859
01:43:21.244 --> 01:43:22.086
MICA: Thanks.

2860
01:43:22.086 --> 01:43:22.919
MARISHA: Yeah.

2861
01:43:22.919 --> 01:43:24.676
SAM: You became like a crazy monster.

2862
01:43:24.676 --> 01:43:27.554
MICA: Yeah, it's fun, I didn't get to poison them, though,

2863
01:43:27.554 --> 01:43:29.947
but usually that's what I like do.

2864
01:43:29.947 --> 01:43:31.198
TRAVIS: You know yetis, there's nothing

2865
01:43:31.198 --> 01:43:32.724
to harvest off of them, right?

2866
01:43:32.724 --> 01:43:37.380
Venomous fang or crazy claw, anything of worth?

2867
01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:40.163
MICA: You burned most of them,

2868
01:43:40.163 --> 01:43:42.021
so there's nothing to harvest.

2869
01:43:42.021 --> 01:43:44.879
SAM: But they might have some stuff back at their camp.

2870
01:43:44.879 --> 01:43:45.720
TRAVIS: Good call.

2871
01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:46.937
LAURA: Yeah, let's check their tents.

2872
01:43:46.937 --> 01:43:49.297
TALIESIN: Let's stealthily.
TRAVIS: Yes.

2873
01:43:49.297 --> 01:43:52.752
LAURA: Both me and my duplicate walk up and high five you.

2874
01:43:52.752 --> 01:43:53.807
MICA: Yeah!

2875
01:43:54.981 --> 01:43:56.397
MATT: You go high five the duplicate and

2876
01:43:56.397 --> 01:43:57.938
your hand just passes through.

2877
01:43:57.938 --> 01:44:00.144
MICA: Oh.
LAURA: Whiff.

2878
01:44:01.677 --> 01:44:03.002
MATT: So you guys are entering the cavern?

2879
01:44:03.002 --> 01:44:04.010
TRAVIS: Stealthily.
MATT: Stealthily,

2880
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:05.210
everyone roll stealth checks, please.

2881
01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:07.545
LAURA: Oh, let me look, let me look.

2882
01:44:07.545 --> 01:44:08.414
TALIESIN: Can we do this with--

2883
01:44:08.414 --> 01:44:10.200
LAURA: I'm out of 2nd-levels, so.

2884
01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:11.554
MATT: All right, so straight rolls.

2885
01:44:11.554 --> 01:44:12.844
LAURA: Straight rolls.

2886
01:44:12.844 --> 01:44:14.747
MICA: Ooh, that's a natural one.

2887
01:44:14.747 --> 01:44:17.963
SAM: Why don't I go ahead to the party, then?

2888
01:44:17.963 --> 01:44:19.121
MATT: You all decided to enter,

2889
01:44:19.121 --> 01:44:20.321
you don't get to decide not to

2890
01:44:20.321 --> 01:44:21.209
because you rolled poorly.

2891
01:44:21.209 --> 01:44:23.268
SAM: No, no, no, but I can go further into the cavern.

2892
01:44:23.268 --> 01:44:24.460
MATT: You can.
SAM: Yeah.

2893
01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:26.081
TRAVIS: 14.
MATT: All right.

2894
01:44:26.081 --> 01:44:28.471
MARISHA: 18 for Beau, 16 for Caleb.

2895
01:44:28.471 --> 01:44:29.308
MATT: All righty.

2896
01:44:29.308 --> 01:44:30.141
SAM: 32.

2897
01:44:30.141 --> 01:44:31.737
LAURA: 10.

2898
01:44:31.737 --> 01:44:32.789
TALIESIN: 10.

2899
01:44:32.789 --> 01:44:34.599
MICA: It's a four total.
MATT: Okay.

2900
01:44:34.599 --> 01:44:39.104
You guys all carefully begin to make your way

2901
01:44:39.104 --> 01:44:42.496
into the entrance of Mythburrow.

2902
01:44:44.216 --> 01:44:47.938
So within and beyond the whipping winds

2903
01:44:47.938 --> 01:44:50.694
lies the rocky cavern, with snow-packed stone

2904
01:44:50.694 --> 01:44:53.248
and the veins of ice spiraling out from around the cave

2905
01:44:53.248 --> 01:44:58.042
to span the ceiling and beyond. This oblong cave

2906
01:44:58.042 --> 01:45:01.084
stands about 60 feet tall and about 100 feet across

2907
01:45:01.084 --> 01:45:04.014
to the opposite end, whilst the western left-hand side

2908
01:45:04.014 --> 01:45:06.357
of the chamber, you can see a cluster of

2909
01:45:06.357 --> 01:45:10.204
makeshift structures made of stretched leather.

2910
01:45:11.095 --> 01:45:14.668
Just thrown together, not, you know,

2911
01:45:14.668 --> 01:45:19.066
great craftsmanship, but very makeshift.

2912
01:45:19.066 --> 01:45:21.278
On the opposite end of the chamber, you can begin to see,

2913
01:45:21.278 --> 01:45:23.155
as you bring the light into,

2914
01:45:23.155 --> 01:45:25.215
you feel more comfortable opening the space a little bit.

2915
01:45:25.215 --> 01:45:27.473
You can see a wide 25-foot tunnel

2916
01:45:27.473 --> 01:45:29.131
that presses further into the mountain.

2917
01:45:29.131 --> 01:45:30.631
LAURA: Okay.

2918
01:45:30.631 --> 01:45:33.228
SAM: That's Valhalla.

2919
01:45:33.228 --> 01:45:36.390
So there's leather structures around?

2920
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:38.654
MATT: Mm-hmm, to the left, western side of where you are.

2921
01:45:38.654 --> 01:45:41.869
SAM: I'm going to go stealthily peek into

2922
01:45:41.869 --> 01:45:44.063
one or two of those, if I can.

2923
01:45:44.063 --> 01:45:45.548
MATT: Sure, all right.

2924
01:45:45.548 --> 01:45:46.408
SAM: Inspect or--

2925
01:45:46.408 --> 01:45:47.849
MATT: You can make an investigation check

2926
01:45:47.849 --> 01:45:49.463
or a perception check, up to you.

2927
01:45:49.463 --> 01:45:50.346
SAM: Investigation.

2928
01:45:50.346 --> 01:45:51.774
MATT: Go for it.

2929
01:45:51.774 --> 01:45:53.364
SAM: 30.

2930
01:45:53.364 --> 01:45:54.862
MATT: Okay!
TRAVIS: Yo.

2931
01:45:54.862 --> 01:45:55.695
MATT: Okay.

2932
01:45:56.731 --> 01:45:59.887
Checking the tents, you find numerous bones

2933
01:45:59.887 --> 01:46:03.616
of all manner of creatures, as well as

2934
01:46:03.616 --> 01:46:07.972
a cache of frozen meat still on some bones.

2935
01:46:07.972 --> 01:46:11.363
When I say bones, I mean probably a good

2936
01:46:11.363 --> 01:46:13.410
300 pounds of bones.

2937
01:46:13.410 --> 01:46:14.780
SAM: Whoa.
TALIESIN: That's a lot of bones.

2938
01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:16.493
MATT: Some look to be from creatures or elk,

2939
01:46:16.493 --> 01:46:18.381
or other things that probably

2940
01:46:18.381 --> 01:46:21.216
live amongst these mountains. Some look humanoid,

2941
01:46:21.216 --> 01:46:22.948
some look larger than humanoid.

2942
01:46:22.948 --> 01:46:24.852
It looks like whatever these things were devouring

2943
01:46:24.852 --> 01:46:28.844
and eating to subsist, they just toss them into

2944
01:46:28.844 --> 01:46:31.922
this back corner on the outskirts of where these tents were

2945
01:46:31.922 --> 01:46:36.390
and then just built this graveyard of bones.

2946
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:38.668
LAURA: ♪ Items in the bones ♪

2947
01:46:38.668 --> 01:46:41.089
MATT: You do see some basic tools.

2948
01:46:41.089 --> 01:46:43.080
Probably what was used to construct this element here.

2949
01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:44.818
It's very basic. It's the equivalent of like

2950
01:46:44.818 --> 01:46:48.207
Stone Age type materials.

2951
01:46:48.207 --> 01:46:49.681
You also see some basic weapons

2952
01:46:49.681 --> 01:46:51.522
and traveling and climbing equipment,

2953
01:46:51.522 --> 01:46:53.856
things that were probably left by some of the individuals

2954
01:46:53.856 --> 01:46:57.221
that were eaten by the yeti here.

2955
01:46:57.221 --> 01:46:58.532
You also notice there are tents here

2956
01:46:58.532 --> 01:47:02.030
for far more than four yetis, probably about nine.

2957
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:03.934
SAM: Oh.

2958
01:47:03.934 --> 01:47:04.925
MATT: So.

2959
01:47:04.925 --> 01:47:06.045
MARISHA: But they're not here?

2960
01:47:06.045 --> 01:47:07.728
MATT: They're not here.
SAM: They might be out hunting.

2961
01:47:07.728 --> 01:47:09.228
MARISHA: 100%.

2962
01:47:10.519 --> 01:47:14.601
SAM: Amid the bones or the basic tools,

2963
01:47:14.601 --> 01:47:17.835
anything shiny, any buckles or anything?

2964
01:47:17.835 --> 01:47:20.208
MATT: Oh yeah, plenty of, like, leftover belts

2965
01:47:20.208 --> 01:47:23.121
and a couple of brass buttons you might find

2966
01:47:23.121 --> 01:47:25.318
from a coat that's torn, you grab a couple of those.

2967
01:47:25.318 --> 01:47:26.495
SAM: Yes, yes.

2968
01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.010
MATT: Yeah. Other than that, it's just the general tools

2969
01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:30.140
and climbing equipment and what anyone

2970
01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:32.075
would bring themselves up a mountain, essentially.

2971
01:47:32.075 --> 01:47:32.908
SAM: Caduceus.

2972
01:47:32.908 --> 01:47:34.636
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm going to walk through

2973
01:47:34.636 --> 01:47:38.285
and do Detect Magic just to--
MATT: Okay.

2974
01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.661
MATT: No Detect Magic.

2975
01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:44.642
Nothing magical in the vicinity, unfortunately.

2976
01:47:44.642 --> 01:47:47.606
There are daggers, swords, random odds things.

2977
01:47:47.606 --> 01:47:50.618
Within these rudimentary stretched pieces of leather,

2978
01:47:50.618 --> 01:47:51.671
as you're looking around,

2979
01:47:51.671 --> 01:47:54.684
you glance up and look, and on the inside,

2980
01:47:54.684 --> 01:47:58.292
there are very, very simple drawings.

2981
01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:03.929
It looks to be made from dirt, or you know,

2982
01:48:03.929 --> 01:48:05.750
the colors, there are variations in color,

2983
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:07.569
so it could be, you know, dirt, urine, blood,

2984
01:48:07.569 --> 01:48:08.594
all sorts of things that could've been used,

2985
01:48:08.594 --> 01:48:11.514
but there are pieces of artwork and such

2986
01:48:11.514 --> 01:48:13.911
put across the inside of the stretched leather.

2987
01:48:13.911 --> 01:48:16.142
MARISHA: Beau will go check those out.

2988
01:48:16.142 --> 01:48:17.056
MATT: Okay.

2989
01:48:17.056 --> 01:48:18.633
MARISHA: Can I get a story from them?

2990
01:48:18.633 --> 01:48:21.858
TALIESIN: You should probably clean up the bodies out front.

2991
01:48:21.858 --> 01:48:24.015
LAURA: I'm really good at understanding art work.

2992
01:48:24.015 --> 01:48:24.848
MARISHA: Yeah.

2993
01:48:24.848 --> 01:48:26.952
MARISHA: No, come on, art history major.

2994
01:48:26.952 --> 01:48:27.785
LAURA: Yeah.

2995
01:48:27.785 --> 01:48:30.118
(chuckling)

2996
01:48:31.795 --> 01:48:35.287
MARISHA: Oh, sitting next to Laura has rubbed off on you.

2997
01:48:35.287 --> 01:48:38.333
(laughter)

2998
01:48:38.333 --> 01:48:39.847
MATT: Now--
TALIESIN: Sorry.

2999
01:48:39.847 --> 01:48:41.485
MATT: It's okay. Sam, with your investigation check,

3000
01:48:41.485 --> 01:48:42.932
because you rolled super high,

3001
01:48:42.932 --> 01:48:44.931
as you guys arrive, you've already ascertained

3002
01:48:44.931 --> 01:48:46.848
what these designs are.

3003
01:48:48.747 --> 01:48:50.782
You can see some sort of

3004
01:48:50.782 --> 01:48:53.219
a lizard-like creature with wings

3005
01:48:53.219 --> 01:48:56.986
depicted in this elevated, almost god-like position,

3006
01:48:56.986 --> 01:49:00.622
and little figures that look probably representative

3007
01:49:00.622 --> 01:49:05.610
of the yetis that live here beneath, arms up beneath it.

3008
01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:09.084
You can see gifts and things

3009
01:49:09.084 --> 01:49:13.809
brought from far away to this creature,

3010
01:49:13.809 --> 01:49:15.649
and just at a quick glance at the different pieces

3011
01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:17.354
of artwork, you can see there's almost like

3012
01:49:17.354 --> 01:49:20.911
a microcosm religion or some sort of a relationship

3013
01:49:20.911 --> 01:49:25.911
of worship to this dragon creature depicted in the artwork.

3014
01:49:26.475 --> 01:49:29.304
SAM: We're on the right track, kiddos.

3015
01:49:29.304 --> 01:49:31.286
LAURA: I have an idea.

3016
01:49:31.286 --> 01:49:33.843
SAM: You want us to pretend to be yetis.

3017
01:49:33.843 --> 01:49:36.476
LAURA: Yes, but what if we

3018
01:49:36.476 --> 01:49:39.164
cut out all of the guts from the yeti

3019
01:49:39.164 --> 01:49:40.585
and put on the yeti suit?

3020
01:49:40.585 --> 01:49:41.830
SAM: Oh, yes.

3021
01:49:41.830 --> 01:49:42.663
TALIESIN: That's--

3022
01:49:42.663 --> 01:49:44.683
LAURA: Then we could walk in like a yeti.

3023
01:49:44.683 --> 01:49:46.024
TRAVIS: You want a tauntaun in there?

3024
01:49:46.024 --> 01:49:48.308
SAM: We can all be, like three of us could be in one.

3025
01:49:48.308 --> 01:49:49.631
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3026
01:49:49.631 --> 01:49:51.389
We could walk in and like

3027
01:49:51.389 --> 01:49:52.849
sit down--
MARISHA: Can't we also like,

3028
01:49:52.849 --> 01:49:54.873
do the Polymorph thing?

3029
01:49:54.873 --> 01:49:56.875
SAM: Oh, oh yeah.
LAURA: Oh, yeah, we could do that.

3030
01:49:56.875 --> 01:50:00.492
(laughter)

3031
01:50:00.492 --> 01:50:02.232
SAM: Wait, go back to the first idea.

3032
01:50:02.232 --> 01:50:03.489
MICA: I thought it was a good plan.

3033
01:50:03.489 --> 01:50:04.841
SAM: I still like the first idea,

3034
01:50:04.841 --> 01:50:06.637
because we can't all Polymorph.

3035
01:50:06.637 --> 01:50:07.765
MATT: Polymorph only allows you

3036
01:50:07.765 --> 01:50:09.671
to turn into beasts, if you remember.

3037
01:50:09.671 --> 01:50:10.767
SAM: And yetis are not--

3038
01:50:10.767 --> 01:50:12.245
MATT: Yetis are not considered beasts.

3039
01:50:12.245 --> 01:50:13.203
LAURA: Oh, see?

3040
01:50:13.203 --> 01:50:15.353
SAM: So we're back to plan A.

3041
01:50:15.353 --> 01:50:16.923
TRAVIS: No, I don't think we're there at all.

3042
01:50:16.923 --> 01:50:17.794
TALIESIN: I don't think that that's a--

3043
01:50:17.794 --> 01:50:19.557
TRAVIS: Have we looked for anything magical?

3044
01:50:19.557 --> 01:50:20.390
TALIESIN: There's nothing.

3045
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:24.775
MICA: Will the dragon be mad we killed its friends?

3046
01:50:24.775 --> 01:50:27.152
SAM: It won't know yet, unless we tell it.

3047
01:50:27.152 --> 01:50:29.424
MARISHA: I feel like the dragon just looks at these guys

3048
01:50:29.424 --> 01:50:31.639
as like a means to an end. I don't know,

3049
01:50:31.639 --> 01:50:33.563
"friends" feels look a strong word

3050
01:50:33.563 --> 01:50:34.685
for a dragon.
TALIESIN: Worshipers

3051
01:50:34.685 --> 01:50:36.698
is the vibe I'm getting.

3052
01:50:36.698 --> 01:50:39.150
SAM: These creatures bring the dragon things,

3053
01:50:39.150 --> 01:50:43.477
present it to the dragon. So we could bring an item,

3054
01:50:43.477 --> 01:50:46.172
present it to the dragon, and now we have to

3055
01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:49.232
get the dragon to breathe on it.

3056
01:50:49.232 --> 01:50:51.634
What is something that you like to breathe on?

3057
01:50:51.634 --> 01:50:54.722
What would a dragon just be like, (hissing) to?

3058
01:50:54.722 --> 01:50:56.465
Something--
MICA: Food.

3059
01:50:56.465 --> 01:50:58.135
SAM: But then it would eat it.

3060
01:50:58.135 --> 01:51:01.452
LAURA: Yeah, but doesn't it, would it breathe

3061
01:51:01.452 --> 01:51:04.562
with ice breath onto something it wanted to eat?

3062
01:51:04.562 --> 01:51:08.839
MATT: As you did read, and you did the pre-research on this,

3063
01:51:08.839 --> 01:51:13.280
white dragons specifically enjoy freezing their prey

3064
01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:16.543
through intense frost breath, and then eating them

3065
01:51:16.543 --> 01:51:17.890
in their frozen state.

3066
01:51:17.890 --> 01:51:18.886
MICA: Oh.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3067
01:51:18.886 --> 01:51:20.955
SAM: They like icicles, popsicles.

3068
01:51:20.955 --> 01:51:24.483
They like frozen crudités, meats.

3069
01:51:24.483 --> 01:51:27.082
LAURA: So we like, put it on a goat or something.

3070
01:51:27.082 --> 01:51:28.645
SAM: Yeah, and it'll freeze the goat.

3071
01:51:28.645 --> 01:51:32.174
TALIESIN: Is it possible to put it beneath some offering

3072
01:51:32.174 --> 01:51:34.768
for the dragon and then either teleport it out

3073
01:51:34.768 --> 01:51:37.685
or grab it away and leave the meat?

3074
01:51:38.991 --> 01:51:40.362
LAURA: I mean, we can use Mage Hand,

3075
01:51:40.362 --> 01:51:43.528
and try to grab it away before the dragon does it.

3076
01:51:43.528 --> 01:51:44.947
TRAVIS: 30 feet, though.

3077
01:51:44.947 --> 01:51:47.058
SAM: If we brought multiple animals,

3078
01:51:47.058 --> 01:51:48.300
can you make multiple animals?

3079
01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:49.605
MICA: I can make a lot of them.

3080
01:51:49.605 --> 01:51:51.023
TALIESIN: And we've already got yetis.

3081
01:51:51.023 --> 01:51:54.433
LAURA: Caleb can, or I can turn myself into a wooly mammoth.

3082
01:51:54.433 --> 01:51:56.027
SAM: That's true, but what I'm saying is,

3083
01:51:56.027 --> 01:51:58.999
if we presented as yetis, if we presented like say,

3084
01:51:58.999 --> 01:52:02.958
four goats to the dragon, and the one in the back

3085
01:52:02.958 --> 01:52:06.084
is the one that has our little piece of ingot in it,

3086
01:52:06.084 --> 01:52:08.284
it's going to freeze all of them, maybe start

3087
01:52:08.284 --> 01:52:10.943
munching on the first one, and when it gets to like

3088
01:52:10.943 --> 01:52:14.597
number three, we just go get the last one and say,

3089
01:52:14.597 --> 01:52:15.910
"Oh, didn't mean to give you this one,

3090
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:18.509
"sorry, dragon," and then leave.

3091
01:52:18.509 --> 01:52:20.743
TALIESIN: Why do we have to steal the goat back?

3092
01:52:20.743 --> 01:52:22.436
SAM: Well, we need the thing that's inside it.

3093
01:52:22.436 --> 01:52:23.370
TALIESIN: Well, why don't we just take the thing

3094
01:52:23.370 --> 01:52:25.014
that's inside and leave the goat?
SAM: How do we do that?

3095
01:52:25.014 --> 01:52:27.574
TALIESIN: Well, if it's in a pile, it doesn't have to be

3096
01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:28.481
inside of it, it's just--

3097
01:52:28.481 --> 01:52:31.193
MARISHA: Maybe the goat has a really cool tag on its collar.

3098
01:52:31.193 --> 01:52:33.404
MICA: I can talk to the goat to make it come back.

3099
01:52:33.404 --> 01:52:34.734
MARISHA: Or it's a cow with a cowbell.

3100
01:52:34.734 --> 01:52:37.449
TALIESIN: Never go wrong with a cowbell.

3101
01:52:37.449 --> 01:52:41.828
LAURA: Or we can send in a wooly mammoth, and--

3102
01:52:41.828 --> 01:52:43.077
MARISHA: Also with a cowbell.

3103
01:52:43.077 --> 01:52:45.043
LAURA: Yeah, and put a cowbell on it--

3104
01:52:45.043 --> 01:52:47.435
TALIESIN: And let it burn the wooly mammoth.

3105
01:52:47.435 --> 01:52:49.769
LAURA: Yeah, and then possibly, the wooly mammoth

3106
01:52:49.769 --> 01:52:52.555
would be able to take it, because they're pretty strong.

3107
01:52:52.555 --> 01:52:55.203
SAM: Even if not, you have the power to then, like,

3108
01:52:55.203 --> 01:52:57.693
Dimension Door out of there and save yourself.

3109
01:52:57.693 --> 01:52:59.659
MARISHA: So wait, we're putting you up as bait?

3110
01:52:59.659 --> 01:53:00.492
SAM: Yeah.

3111
01:53:00.492 --> 01:53:01.680
LAURA: But I'd be a wooly mammoth.

3112
01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.016
MICA: I can conjure a wooly mammoth.

3113
01:53:04.016 --> 01:53:04.855
SAM: Oh.

3114
01:53:04.855 --> 01:53:07.184
LAURA: What if we're both wooly mammoths?

3115
01:53:07.184 --> 01:53:09.195
MICA: Then it won't know what wooly mammoth to breathe on.

3116
01:53:09.195 --> 01:53:11.085
TALIESIN: And like, how much damage can the flame do,

3117
01:53:11.085 --> 01:53:13.556
100, 200 points of damage in one shot?

3118
01:53:13.556 --> 01:53:14.559
300?

3119
01:53:14.559 --> 01:53:16.097
I mean, we'll be fine.

3120
01:53:16.097 --> 01:53:17.180
SAM: What are you talking about?

3121
01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:18.874
TALIESIN: That's a lot of kittens.

3122
01:53:18.874 --> 01:53:20.213
TRAVIS: What are points?

3123
01:53:20.213 --> 01:53:22.026
TALIESIN: That's one kitten, I think we've established this,

3124
01:53:22.026 --> 01:53:23.109
haven't we?
MARISHA: One, yeah.

3125
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:24.124
MARISHA: 200 kittens.

3126
01:53:24.124 --> 01:53:24.974
TALIESIN: 200 kittens.

3127
01:53:24.974 --> 01:53:28.776
LAURA: What if the minute that, you know, the form drops,

3128
01:53:28.776 --> 01:53:31.825
as the wooly mammoth, then I just Dimension Door away.

3129
01:53:31.825 --> 01:53:33.395
SAM: I like it.

3130
01:53:33.395 --> 01:53:35.349
TALIESIN: This seems--
SAM: I like it.

3131
01:53:35.349 --> 01:53:36.182
TALIESIN: This seems--

3132
01:53:36.182 --> 01:53:37.685
SAM: We'll be close at hand to protect her,

3133
01:53:37.685 --> 01:53:39.680
because we will be in a yeti costume.

3134
01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:41.171
(laughter)

3135
01:53:41.171 --> 01:53:43.708
I am not getting up on this yeti costume.

3136
01:53:43.708 --> 01:53:48.249
MARISHA: (as Caleb) I can also make a

3137
01:53:48.249 --> 01:53:53.199
tiny hut near the battle, <i>ja</i>.

3138
01:53:53.199 --> 01:53:55.119
(laughter)

3139
01:53:55.119 --> 01:53:56.545
SAM: (Arnold Schwarzenegger voice) I had to let him go.

3140
01:53:56.545 --> 01:53:57.944
(laughter)

3141
01:53:57.944 --> 01:54:00.769
MARISHA: Come with me to the hut.

3142
01:54:00.769 --> 01:54:04.263
TALIESIN: Dragons are a lot, though, I mean, I think we're--

3143
01:54:04.263 --> 01:54:06.935
SAM: Yeah, we could have a hut to retreat to.

3144
01:54:06.935 --> 01:54:09.814
TALIESIN: This seems like, I don't know.

3145
01:54:09.814 --> 01:54:12.616
SAM: It's very simple, Caleb, I mean Caduceus.

3146
01:54:12.616 --> 01:54:15.004
You, me, and Fjord are in a yeti costume.

3147
01:54:15.004 --> 01:54:15.837
TALIESIN: No.

3148
01:54:15.837 --> 01:54:19.367
SAM: We're escorting two wooly mammoths up as tribute,

3149
01:54:19.367 --> 01:54:21.732
the dragon freezes both wooly mammoths,

3150
01:54:21.732 --> 01:54:24.275
one of them has our mithral on it--

3151
01:54:24.275 --> 01:54:26.057
LAURA: I'm going to keep an eye on the door,

3152
01:54:26.057 --> 01:54:28.480
in case other things are coming back.

3153
01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:29.539
TALIESIN: They'll be very angry because there's

3154
01:54:29.539 --> 01:54:31.372
a bunch of dead yetis out there.
LAURA: I know.

3155
01:54:31.372 --> 01:54:33.036
MICA: I hate to be a party, hmm?

3156
01:54:33.036 --> 01:54:35.150
MATT: What are you using to conjure the mammoth?

3157
01:54:35.150 --> 01:54:36.744
MICA: Conjure Animals.

3158
01:54:36.744 --> 01:54:39.016
MATT: What's the highest--
MICA: CR2.

3159
01:54:39.016 --> 01:54:42.649
MATT: CR2, wooly mammoths are CR6, just as a heads up.

3160
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:44.511
It's all good.

3161
01:54:44.511 --> 01:54:46.618
SAM: One mammoth.

3162
01:54:46.618 --> 01:54:49.849
MICA: I hate to be a party pooper, but I did counting,

3163
01:54:49.849 --> 01:54:52.635
and there are lots of tents, and there are more tents

3164
01:54:52.635 --> 01:54:55.161
than we killed, and if we're going to keep talking here,

3165
01:54:55.161 --> 01:54:57.103
we should be prepared to fight or we should go outside.

3166
01:54:57.103 --> 01:54:59.492
MARISHA: <i>Ja</i>, you're actually very right.

3167
01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:03.393
I will, as Caleb, will go to the front of the cave

3168
01:55:03.393 --> 01:55:06.096
and he will take out his silver thread,

3169
01:55:06.096 --> 01:55:07.375
and he will start doing--

3170
01:55:07.375 --> 01:55:08.267
MATT: Set up an Alarm spell

3171
01:55:08.267 --> 01:55:09.117
around there.
TALIESIN: Hiding some of these

3172
01:55:09.117 --> 01:55:11.483
bodies so that they're not just sitting out here.

3173
01:55:11.483 --> 01:55:14.881
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to go out, because I'm really strong,

3174
01:55:14.881 --> 01:55:17.595
and move the bodies and hide them under snow.

3175
01:55:17.595 --> 01:55:18.713
MATT: Okay.

3176
01:55:18.713 --> 01:55:23.363
MICA: Will Conjure Flame

3177
01:55:23.363 --> 01:55:25.504
burn yeti bodies?

3178
01:55:25.504 --> 01:55:27.922
MATT: Over time, maybe.

3179
01:55:27.922 --> 01:55:30.890
It'll take you probably about an hour to an hour and a half

3180
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:32.595
per body, because it's a lot of body,

3181
01:55:32.595 --> 01:55:34.901
and even then, it's still going to be a charred corpse.

3182
01:55:34.901 --> 01:55:36.917
They're not going to turn to ash,

3183
01:55:36.917 --> 01:55:38.863
you'd need a really hot flame for that.

3184
01:55:38.863 --> 01:55:41.512
MICA: Can I not, like, turn up the dial on my palm?

3185
01:55:41.512 --> 01:55:42.547
MATT: Probably not that high.

3186
01:55:42.547 --> 01:55:43.383
MICA: Okay. (laughs)

3187
01:55:43.383 --> 01:55:45.908
MATT: You can't like, conjure a phosphorus grenade,

3188
01:55:45.908 --> 01:55:47.784
in the middle of, with a cantrip.

3189
01:55:47.784 --> 01:55:48.828
MICA: I was hoping I could make like a torch,

3190
01:55:48.828 --> 01:55:50.079
like a blue flame torch.

3191
01:55:50.079 --> 01:55:51.654
MATT: (scorching)

3192
01:55:51.654 --> 01:55:53.078
TRAVIS: From the simple weapons that Nott found,

3193
01:55:53.078 --> 01:55:56.854
can I find a sword, just a simple sword?

3194
01:55:56.854 --> 01:55:59.583
MATT: Yeah, there is actually a longsword amongst there,

3195
01:55:59.583 --> 01:56:02.016
it looks like it's cold to the touch

3196
01:56:02.016 --> 01:56:03.479
and hasn't been poorly treated,

3197
01:56:03.479 --> 01:56:05.094
it's a little dinged on a couple edges,

3198
01:56:05.094 --> 01:56:07.000
but it's still very serviceable and balanced.

3199
01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.617
TRAVIS: Is that like a plus,

3200
01:56:08.617 --> 01:56:11.858
or a plus eight versatile weapon?

3201
01:56:11.858 --> 01:56:14.551
Or not a plus eight, but a d8?

3202
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:15.720
MATT: It's just a d8, yeah.

3203
01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:18.030
TRAVIS: Okay, I will take that.

3204
01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:18.963
MATT: You got it.
LAURA: As I'm down

3205
01:56:18.963 --> 01:56:21.321
on the ground dragging the yeti bodies

3206
01:56:21.321 --> 01:56:25.464
into hiding, I miss Yasha a lot, because me and her

3207
01:56:25.464 --> 01:56:30.441
were always the ones that carried heavy things.

3208
01:56:30.441 --> 01:56:32.154
MATT: Aww, okay.

3209
01:56:32.154 --> 01:56:34.205
TRAVIS: Shall we send the cat in a little further

3210
01:56:34.205 --> 01:56:35.861
to see what's inside?

3211
01:56:35.861 --> 01:56:36.749
See if--

3212
01:56:36.749 --> 01:56:39.885
TALIESIN: Perhaps put the dome up first before we do that.

3213
01:56:39.885 --> 01:56:42.293
MARISHA: Caleb cast the Alarm spell

3214
01:56:42.293 --> 01:56:44.276
at the mouth of the cave.
MATT: Correct.

3215
01:56:44.276 --> 01:56:47.554
MARISHA: He'll go back inside, by the tents.

3216
01:56:47.554 --> 01:56:49.196
We want to pop up a dome, or maybe

3217
01:56:49.196 --> 01:56:50.503
on the other side of the tents?

3218
01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:53.960
On the opposite side, he'll make another dome.

3219
01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:56.879
Oh, yeah, <i>ja</i>, jah.

3220
01:56:56.879 --> 01:57:00.970
Make a dome, and then

3221
01:57:00.970 --> 01:57:03.820
Frumpkin, be stealthier this time.

3222
01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.416
(laughter)

3223
01:57:05.416 --> 01:57:08.024
MATT: You chuck Frumpkin into which direction, to do what?

3224
01:57:08.024 --> 01:57:10.963
MARISHA: Oh, deeper in the cave.
MATT: Okay.

3225
01:57:10.963 --> 01:57:14.434
So go ahead and roll stealth for Frumpkin.

3226
01:57:14.434 --> 01:57:16.156
MICA: Yeet cat.

3227
01:57:16.156 --> 01:57:17.424
TALIESIN: I love that show.

3228
01:57:17.424 --> 01:57:18.515
MICA: Yeet the Cat?

3229
01:57:18.515 --> 01:57:20.023
(laughter)

3230
01:57:20.023 --> 01:57:21.856
MARISHA: Oh, it's cockapooed.

3231
01:57:22.872 --> 01:57:24.595
MATT: Never hurts to help.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3232
01:57:24.595 --> 01:57:27.308
MARISHA: Plus four. What's the cat's dex?

3233
01:57:27.308 --> 01:57:28.246
12.

3234
01:57:28.246 --> 01:57:29.154
MATT: 12, okay, and then

3235
01:57:29.154 --> 01:57:31.042
roll a perception check with disadvantage,

3236
01:57:31.042 --> 01:57:32.705
because there is no light.

3237
01:57:32.705 --> 01:57:34.638
SAM: The cat's scanning deeper in the cave?

3238
01:57:34.638 --> 01:57:37.414
TALIESIN: We're looking at a good CAT scan.

3239
01:57:37.414 --> 01:57:39.360
I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me.

3240
01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:41.506
TRAVIS: Fuckity fuck, fuck, fuck.

3241
01:57:41.506 --> 01:57:42.339
MICA: What'd you do?

3242
01:57:42.339 --> 01:57:43.172
MARISHA: Natural one.

3243
01:57:43.172 --> 01:57:44.416
(groaning)

3244
01:57:44.416 --> 01:57:46.596
LAURA: On stealth or perception?
MARISHA: Perception.

3245
01:57:46.596 --> 01:57:51.244
MATT: So Frumpkin wanders further into the cavern.

3246
01:57:51.244 --> 01:57:55.094
The chill grows more intense,

3247
01:57:56.052 --> 01:57:59.156
and the cavern itself seems to begin to corkscrew,

3248
01:57:59.156 --> 01:58:03.094
like it's shifting and wandering and winding.

3249
01:58:03.094 --> 01:58:06.660
Frumpkin gets about 120 or so feet in,

3250
01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:09.757
and has been able to really make out no details at all.

3251
01:58:09.757 --> 01:58:11.016
MARISHA: Okay.

3252
01:58:11.016 --> 01:58:11.921
(snaps fingers)

3253
01:58:11.921 --> 01:58:13.962
MATT: Okay, you bamf Frumpkin came back.

3254
01:58:13.962 --> 01:58:18.929
MARISHA: I explain to them in an incredible Zemnian accent

3255
01:58:20.136 --> 01:58:24.303
that's it's really fucking cold and about 120 feet

3256
01:58:27.298 --> 01:58:30.122
of a journey, yeah.

3257
01:58:30.122 --> 01:58:31.620
LAURA: Am I back from hiding the bodies yet

3258
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:33.746
or am I still hiding bodies?

3259
01:58:33.746 --> 01:58:34.879
MATT: Is it just you?

3260
01:58:34.879 --> 01:58:35.970
MICA: I'm helping.
MATT: You're helping?

3261
01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:36.803
MICA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

3262
01:58:36.803 --> 01:58:39.506
I'll say it takes you about an hour or so to properly

3263
01:58:39.506 --> 01:58:41.111
feel comfortable with hiding the bodies.

3264
01:58:41.111 --> 01:58:43.488
Though there is still a mess of, you know,

3265
01:58:43.488 --> 01:58:45.573
charred gore and stuff at the face of the cave

3266
01:58:45.573 --> 01:58:46.825
you can try and cover with snow, and that'll

3267
01:58:46.825 --> 01:58:48.108
take a little longer.
LAURA: Yeah.

3268
01:58:48.108 --> 01:58:50.597
MATT: Okay, so an hour and a half, I'd say.

3269
01:58:50.597 --> 01:58:55.560
SAM: So we have it rest, we have to evade yetis

3270
01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:57.987
who come in here.
TALIESIN: We might.

3271
01:58:57.987 --> 01:59:00.756
SAM: We have to still formulate a plan for--

3272
01:59:00.756 --> 01:59:02.622
TALIESIN: I like the idea of offering a sacrifice

3273
01:59:02.622 --> 01:59:03.468
and then getting,

3274
01:59:03.468 --> 01:59:06.825
I just don't think we should offer it one of us,

3275
01:59:06.825 --> 01:59:08.845
that feels dangerous.

3276
01:59:08.845 --> 01:59:10.387
I think we should offer it something

3277
01:59:10.387 --> 01:59:12.848
and maybe just try and get what we need.

3278
01:59:12.848 --> 01:59:13.862
SAM: We don't have anything to offer it.

3279
01:59:13.862 --> 01:59:15.160
TALIESIN: We can make things.

3280
01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.895
SAM: We can make a small animal, right?

3281
01:59:16.895 --> 01:59:19.011
TALIESIN: Well how big, what's the biggest--

3282
01:59:19.011 --> 01:59:20.610
SAM: Can you make a cow, with a cowbell?

3283
01:59:20.610 --> 01:59:22.777
MICA: How big is challenge rating two?

3284
01:59:22.777 --> 01:59:24.978
TRAVIS: It's a dragon, doesn't it like treasure?

3285
01:59:24.978 --> 01:59:25.991
MATT: How big is?

3286
01:59:25.991 --> 01:59:27.966
MICA: Challenge rating two, like how big can I get?

3287
01:59:27.966 --> 01:59:28.964
MATT: Oh, for you?

3288
01:59:28.964 --> 01:59:31.445
MICA: Like if I'm conjuring a challenge rating two creature.

3289
01:59:31.445 --> 01:59:32.783
TALIESIN: We can add some stuff.
MATT: Gotcha.

3290
01:59:32.783 --> 01:59:36.562
TRAVIS: Yeah, we have gold, we have platinum, we have--

3291
01:59:36.562 --> 01:59:38.729
SAM: To talk to it, you mean?

3292
01:59:40.492 --> 01:59:42.449
MATT: Like a brown bear is challenge rating one.

3293
01:59:42.449 --> 01:59:43.465
MICA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh.

3294
01:59:43.465 --> 01:59:44.932
MATT: Dire wolf is challenge rating one.

3295
01:59:44.932 --> 01:59:46.044
MICA: Oh!

3296
01:59:46.044 --> 01:59:48.634
So challenge rating two would be like a--

3297
01:59:48.634 --> 01:59:50.449
MATT: Giant boar is a challenge rating two.

3298
01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:52.239
LAURA: Ooh.
MATT: Yeah.

3299
01:59:53.105 --> 01:59:55.112
MICA: Do you think it would like to eat a boar?

3300
01:59:55.112 --> 01:59:57.316
LAURA: A giant one.
MICA: A giant boar.

3301
01:59:57.316 --> 01:59:58.649
LAURA: That sound good.

3302
01:59:59.995 --> 02:00:01.025
TALIESIN: I don't know.

3303
02:00:01.025 --> 02:00:03.718
SAM: Well, do we want to try to buy it off?

3304
02:00:03.718 --> 02:00:05.749
MATT: A giant elk is challenge rating two.

3305
02:00:05.749 --> 02:00:09.915
MICA: Or an elk, or something hoofed,

3306
02:00:09.915 --> 02:00:13.732
or something fuzzy.

3307
02:00:13.732 --> 02:00:14.717
TALIESIN: Bacon's always, I'm told--

3308
02:00:14.717 --> 02:00:16.600
SAM: Well, whatever you think would last the longest

3309
02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:21.600
against ice. So what about a wintry type creature?

3310
02:00:22.305 --> 02:00:24.722
Polar bear or some sort of--

3311
02:00:26.462 --> 02:00:28.567
TALIESIN: That ain't bad.

3312
02:00:28.567 --> 02:00:32.276
MICA: What about an ice spider queen?

3313
02:00:32.276 --> 02:00:35.067
SAM: Is that a thing that can resist some ice damage?

3314
02:00:35.067 --> 02:00:36.202
MICA: That is challenge rating two.

3315
02:00:36.202 --> 02:00:37.093
MATT: Is it?
MICA: 'Tis.

3316
02:00:37.093 --> 02:00:39.126
MATT: Then I'd allow it.

3317
02:00:39.126 --> 02:00:40.933
Is it a beast?

3318
02:00:40.933 --> 02:00:42.352
SAM: Is it a beast?

3319
02:00:42.352 --> 02:00:43.480
LAURA: Large beast.

3320
02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:44.908
MATT: Yep, you got it.

3321
02:00:44.908 --> 02:00:47.169
SAM: So and it can resist some ice damage.

3322
02:00:47.169 --> 02:00:49.300
MICA: It's an ice queen, I would assume.

3323
02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:51.416
SAM: All right. That seems like a plan.

3324
02:00:51.416 --> 02:00:53.090
MICA: Can it resist cold damage?

3325
02:00:53.090 --> 02:00:53.923
MATT: I don't know, does it say

3326
02:00:53.923 --> 02:00:55.514
that it has resistance on it?

3327
02:00:57.876 --> 02:01:00.647
TALIESIN: At the top, maybe.
MICA: Maybe the top?

3328
02:01:00.647 --> 02:01:02.262
Resistant to cold, yes.

3329
02:01:02.262 --> 02:01:03.468
SAM: That's good.

3330
02:01:03.468 --> 02:01:05.150
TALIESIN: So really take some extra.

3331
02:01:05.150 --> 02:01:07.372
MICA: Do you think it wants to eat spiders?

3332
02:01:07.372 --> 02:01:08.709
LAURA: I mean, maybe.

3333
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:10.516
Anything that comes into its lair, probably.

3334
02:01:10.516 --> 02:01:13.254
SAM: We could put a bunch of steaks all over the spider,

3335
02:01:13.254 --> 02:01:15.764
just in case.

3336
02:01:15.764 --> 02:01:18.432
Like a cape of steak, a steak cape.

3337
02:01:18.432 --> 02:01:20.094
MATT: An ice steak spider queen.

3338
02:01:20.094 --> 02:01:21.679
(laughter)

3339
02:01:21.679 --> 02:01:23.980
TALIESIN: In the tent painting, what are they offering?

3340
02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:26.186
What does it seem like-- what's on the altar

3341
02:01:26.186 --> 02:01:29.179
if you're trying to work it out?

3342
02:01:29.179 --> 02:01:30.455
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3343
02:01:30.455 --> 02:01:31.576
TALIESIN: Why investigation?

3344
02:01:31.576 --> 02:01:33.137
MATT: Because this is the kind of thing,

3345
02:01:33.137 --> 02:01:35.615
this is what deducing is all about, buddy.

3346
02:01:35.615 --> 02:01:37.378
TRAVIS: Caducing.
MICA: I thought you said Caducing.

3347
02:01:37.378 --> 02:01:39.695
TALIESIN: Five, man, five.

3348
02:01:39.695 --> 02:01:43.371
MATT: You're not a person who

3349
02:01:43.371 --> 02:01:44.955
appreciates a lot of fine art.

3350
02:01:44.955 --> 02:01:47.088
TALIESIN: To be fair, this yeti who drew this:

3351
02:01:47.088 --> 02:01:48.444
not very talented.

3352
02:01:48.444 --> 02:01:49.735
MATT: No, it's not on you, it's on him.

3353
02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:51.225
LAURA: You could call me over, I'm just saying.

3354
02:01:51.225 --> 02:01:52.489
TALIESIN: Hey, Jester.

3355
02:01:52.489 --> 02:01:54.065
LAURA: I am good at looking at art.

3356
02:01:54.065 --> 02:01:55.112
TALIESIN: You are literally sitting next me

3357
02:01:55.112 --> 02:01:56.779
saying this right now, I feel like.

3358
02:01:56.779 --> 02:01:58.623
LAURA: Could call me over anytime you want.

3359
02:01:58.623 --> 02:01:59.707
TALIESIN: Should I do it now?

3360
02:01:59.707 --> 02:02:01.167
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Hey Jester.

3361
02:02:01.167 --> 02:02:02.158
LAURA: Yeah?

3362
02:02:02.158 --> 02:02:03.895
TALIESIN: What do you think about this?

3363
02:02:03.895 --> 02:02:05.739
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3364
02:02:05.739 --> 02:02:07.037
(laughter)

3365
02:02:07.037 --> 02:02:09.096
TALIESIN: I don't know.

3366
02:02:09.096 --> 02:02:10.479
LAURA: 16.

3367
02:02:12.243 --> 02:02:13.848
MATT: It's not very well drawn.

3368
02:02:13.848 --> 02:02:15.109
You're not sure.

3369
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:16.786
LAURA: It's a pretty shitty drawing.

3370
02:02:16.786 --> 02:02:18.054
TALIESIN: That's what I said.

3371
02:02:18.054 --> 02:02:21.772
I mean, it's what I was thinking.
LAURA: I think it's drawn with poop?

3372
02:02:21.772 --> 02:02:23.418
TALIESIN: (sniffing)

3373
02:02:23.418 --> 02:02:25.249
It's too cold, I can't tell.

3374
02:02:25.249 --> 02:02:27.499
(laughter)

3375
02:02:28.418 --> 02:02:29.567
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

3376
02:02:29.567 --> 02:02:30.595
TALIESIN: Maybe, well, we're going to take a--

3377
02:02:30.595 --> 02:02:32.083
MICA: Can we take a nap?

3378
02:02:32.083 --> 02:02:33.691
SAM: Well, okay, but if we take a nap here,

3379
02:02:33.691 --> 02:02:36.126
there's good odds that the yetis are going to come back.

3380
02:02:36.126 --> 02:02:37.376
MICA: There's an Alarm spell.

3381
02:02:37.376 --> 02:02:39.111
SAM: Sure, but then we have to wake up and fight them.

3382
02:02:39.111 --> 02:02:39.949
That's okay.

3383
02:02:39.949 --> 02:02:41.257
TALIESIN: We don't have to wake up and fight them.

3384
02:02:41.257 --> 02:02:43.393
SAM: That's true.
MICA: They won't see us if we--

3385
02:02:43.393 --> 02:02:44.324
TALIESIN: Stay chill.

3386
02:02:44.324 --> 02:02:45.663
MICA: Stay at the side of the wall.

3387
02:02:45.663 --> 02:02:46.715
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.
SAM: All right.

3388
02:02:46.715 --> 02:02:48.831
TALIESIN: We'll know that they're home and then we can

3389
02:02:48.831 --> 02:02:51.785
take care of it once we wake up.

3390
02:02:51.785 --> 02:02:53.685
SAM: All right, Caleb, do you want to make a dome inside

3391
02:02:53.685 --> 02:02:54.518
their tent?

3392
02:02:54.518 --> 02:02:56.437
MARISHA: Oh, it's already done.

3393
02:02:56.437 --> 02:02:59.240
MATT: So you're taking a long rest on the opposite wall

3394
02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:00.923
within the yeti cave.
SAM: Okay.

3395
02:03:00.923 --> 02:03:02.271
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: So I'm understanding that right?

3396
02:03:02.271 --> 02:03:03.337
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Yes.

3397
02:03:03.337 --> 02:03:04.266
MATT: Okay, all right.

3398
02:03:04.266 --> 02:03:05.814
LAURA: It's made to look like rock.

3399
02:03:05.814 --> 02:03:06.888
MATT: Okay.

3400
02:03:06.888 --> 02:03:09.111
TALIESIN: Kind of trying to--
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

3401
02:03:09.111 --> 02:03:11.302
TRAVIS: I just want to double-check.

3402
02:03:11.302 --> 02:03:12.935
We want to be inside the cave

3403
02:03:12.935 --> 02:03:14.997
for for when the tripwire goes off and lets them know

3404
02:03:14.997 --> 02:03:16.629
that they are in the cave with us

3405
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:17.909
instead of outside of the cave.

3406
02:03:17.909 --> 02:03:19.033
LAURA: They don't hear the tripwire.

3407
02:03:19.033 --> 02:03:21.807
TRAVIS: No, we do, but then we're in there with them.

3408
02:03:21.807 --> 02:03:23.446
MICA: But they can't see us.

3409
02:03:23.446 --> 02:03:25.717
TALIESIN: Well, the can see us, can't they?

3410
02:03:25.717 --> 02:03:29.068
TRAVIS: There's a big-ass dome
where there wasn't one before.

3411
02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:31.455
MATT: There is something new in their living space

3412
02:03:31.455 --> 02:03:34.047
that they've never seen before on the opposite side.

3413
02:03:34.047 --> 02:03:35.755
TRAVIS: -- outside the cave, please?

3414
02:03:35.755 --> 02:03:37.584
TALIESIN: That is a fair point.

3415
02:03:37.584 --> 02:03:38.710
MATT: You'd have to cast it again.

3416
02:03:38.710 --> 02:03:40.784
MARISHA: But they can't get through the dome.

3417
02:03:40.784 --> 02:03:42.493
LAURA: Yeah, but it's only eight hours.

3418
02:03:42.493 --> 02:03:45.137
TALIESIN: Then they can go poke the dragon

3419
02:03:45.137 --> 02:03:47.719
and say, "Hey, there's some stuff in a dome."

3420
02:03:47.719 --> 02:03:48.886
LAURA: Maybe we should just--

3421
02:03:48.886 --> 02:03:51.332
TRAVIS: What's the intelligence of a yeti, Reani?

3422
02:03:51.332 --> 02:03:53.267
How smart?
MARISHA: I can do it one more time.

3423
02:03:53.267 --> 02:03:54.494
SAM: Okay, then let's go outside.

3424
02:03:54.494 --> 02:03:57.605
LAURA: Let's go outside, we'll put our dome--

3425
02:03:57.605 --> 02:03:59.705
MATT: Okay. (laughs)
LAURA: -- outside.

3426
02:03:59.705 --> 02:04:00.894
SAM: Where it was before.

3427
02:04:00.894 --> 02:04:04.445
MATT: All right, same space, you set up the dome.

3428
02:04:04.445 --> 02:04:06.907
Caleb, you're off your game today.

3429
02:04:06.907 --> 02:04:08.829
(laughter)

3430
02:04:08.829 --> 02:04:09.662
MATT: All right.

3431
02:04:09.662 --> 02:04:12.090
TALIESIN: Yeah, before we go to sleep, I do have one thing

3432
02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:13.794
I want to do if we're all--

3433
02:04:13.794 --> 02:04:16.262
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Liam has like eight things he wants to do.

3434
02:04:16.262 --> 02:04:17.634
MATT: Of course he does, what's he want to do?

3435
02:04:17.634 --> 02:04:19.634
MARISHA: He sent me a document.

3436
02:04:21.687 --> 02:04:24.935
He wants to change the Transmuter Stone

3437
02:04:24.935 --> 02:04:26.810
to resistance to cold damage.

3438
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:27.643
MATT: Got it.

3439
02:04:27.643 --> 02:04:29.263
MARISHA: Then he wants to cast Identify

3440
02:04:29.263 --> 02:04:31.924
on all of those things that spilled out of the library book.

3441
02:04:31.924 --> 02:04:35.327
SAM: Oh, the fucking, the two boxes and the bag or whatever.

3442
02:04:35.327 --> 02:04:37.266
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: That came out of the page.

3443
02:04:37.266 --> 02:04:38.377
TRAVIS: That came out of the page of the spell--

3444
02:04:38.377 --> 02:04:40.551
MATT: Oh, right, yes, yes.

3445
02:04:40.551 --> 02:04:42.711
MARISHA: Then Leomund's Tiny Hut for the dome.

3446
02:04:42.711 --> 02:04:43.965
SAM: Yeah, that's not bad.

3447
02:04:43.965 --> 02:04:45.960
MARISHA: Yeah, that's not too bad.

3448
02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:48.461
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Just giving him shit because I can.

3449
02:04:48.461 --> 02:04:49.313
MATT: No worries.

3450
02:04:49.313 --> 02:04:51.249
MICA: You're going to get like eight angry texts.

3451
02:04:51.249 --> 02:04:52.181
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter)

3452
02:04:52.181 --> 02:04:53.014
TRAVIS: That's a very detailed page,

3453
02:04:53.014 --> 02:04:54.186
I got to give him credit.

3454
02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:56.315
SAM: It's written in German.

3455
02:04:56.315 --> 02:04:57.460
LAURA: Good thing you took that class.

3456
02:04:57.460 --> 02:04:59.243
MARISHA: Thank god.
MICA: That one class.

3457
02:04:59.243 --> 02:05:01.068
MARISHA: Two semesters.

3458
02:05:01.068 --> 02:05:02.801
LAURA: Whoa.

3459
02:05:02.801 --> 02:05:04.858
MATT: All right, so.

3460
02:05:04.858 --> 02:05:07.174
Some of the things that fell out,

3461
02:05:07.174 --> 02:05:09.864
the little box containers, one of them

3462
02:05:09.864 --> 02:05:11.564
appears to be a snuff box.

3463
02:05:11.564 --> 02:05:13.239
MARISHA: Okay.

3464
02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:17.122
MATT: Second one looks to be a small,

3465
02:05:17.122 --> 02:05:21.042
jangly container of coin,

3466
02:05:21.042 --> 02:05:23.567
contains 25 platinum pieces.

3467
02:05:23.567 --> 02:05:25.008
SAM and MICA: Ooh.

3468
02:05:25.008 --> 02:05:28.531
MATT: The third item is a scroll case.

3469
02:05:28.531 --> 02:05:29.760
(gasping)

3470
02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:31.866
MARISHA: Oh my god, he's going to be so happy.

3471
02:05:31.866 --> 02:05:35.151
MATT: The scroll case does contain three specific spells.

3472
02:05:35.151 --> 02:05:36.800
LAURA: (gasps)

3473
02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:38.963
MATT: Greater Invisibility.

3474
02:05:38.963 --> 02:05:42.012
Major Image, and Levitate.

3475
02:05:42.012 --> 02:05:43.543
LAURA: Whoa!

3476
02:05:43.543 --> 02:05:46.668
Wait, does that mean that he can learn those spells?

3477
02:05:46.668 --> 02:05:48.695
MARISHA: How long does take for him to learn?

3478
02:05:48.695 --> 02:05:52.230
Greater Invisibility, greater, something image, Major Image?

3479
02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:53.936
MATT: Major Image.

3480
02:05:53.936 --> 02:05:55.434
TRAVIS and MATT: And Levitate.

3481
02:05:55.434 --> 02:05:57.884
MARISHA: And Levitate.
SAM: Ooh.

3482
02:05:57.884 --> 02:05:59.283
MARISHA: That's sick.

3483
02:05:59.283 --> 02:06:01.606
LAURA: If Liam was here, he'd be so pissed

3484
02:06:01.606 --> 02:06:03.412
that we were learning the spells.

3485
02:06:03.412 --> 02:06:07.234
Yeah, he would be like, "You don't know what my spells are."

3486
02:06:07.234 --> 02:06:09.087
Sorry, Liam.

3487
02:06:09.087 --> 02:06:10.826
SAM: We love you.

3488
02:06:10.826 --> 02:06:11.851
MICA: Cue angry texts.

3489
02:06:11.851 --> 02:06:13.188
(laughter)

3490
02:06:13.188 --> 02:06:14.429
MARISHA: He did say,

3491
02:06:14.429 --> 02:06:16.754
if useful for dragon dealings, he would share.

3492
02:06:16.754 --> 02:06:20.058
If not, he would keep it under wraps until next game.

3493
02:06:20.058 --> 02:06:21.441
MICA: Oh!

3494
02:06:21.441 --> 02:06:22.651
MATT: Welp.
TALIESIN: Well.

3495
02:06:22.651 --> 02:06:24.434
TRAVIS: You deemed them useful!

3496
02:06:24.434 --> 02:06:26.628
MARISHA: I deem them useful.

3497
02:06:26.628 --> 02:06:28.033
LAURA: They are useful.
MARISHA: They are.

3498
02:06:28.033 --> 02:06:30.189
MICA: You can levitate a dragon and then drop it.

3499
02:06:30.189 --> 02:06:34.217
We can Greater Invisibility all of us.

3500
02:06:34.217 --> 02:06:36.350
TRAVIS: ♪ I think they have truesight. ♪

3501
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:37.257
TALIESIN: I, yeah.

3502
02:06:37.257 --> 02:06:38.474
LAURA: I don't know though, but do you--

3503
02:06:38.474 --> 02:06:42.332
MATT: Okay, it does take two hours for each level

3504
02:06:42.332 --> 02:06:44.957
of the spell to inscribe it, and he'll be not getting

3505
02:06:44.957 --> 02:06:47.060
a long rest if he does that tonight,

3506
02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:49.075
and he'll be exhausted if he doesn't sleep.

3507
02:06:49.075 --> 02:06:51.130
So these are the things he might need to scribe

3508
02:06:51.130 --> 02:06:52.912
down the road when he has some down time.

3509
02:06:52.912 --> 02:06:54.495
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

3510
02:06:55.428 --> 02:06:56.403
MATT: All right.

3511
02:06:56.403 --> 02:06:58.318
MARISHA: But useful for dragons--

3512
02:06:58.318 --> 02:07:00.844
TALIESIN: The snuff box, nothing fancy about the snuff box?

3513
02:07:00.844 --> 02:07:02.468
MATT: You open it up and it's filled with

3514
02:07:02.468 --> 02:07:05.150
some sort of ashy powder.

3515
02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:06.900
MARISHA: Do I recognize it?

3516
02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:07.733
MATT: Snuff.

3517
02:07:07.733 --> 02:07:08.634
MARISHA: Snuff?

3518
02:07:08.634 --> 02:07:11.108
TALIESIN: I've already burned my Detect Magic for the day.

3519
02:07:11.108 --> 02:07:12.616
LAURA: Oh, I might have Detect--

3520
02:07:12.616 --> 02:07:14.266
no wait, I have Dispel Magic.

3521
02:07:14.266 --> 02:07:17.121
SAM: He used Identify, he knows what it is, it's snuff.

3522
02:07:17.121 --> 02:07:18.596
MATT: Ash.

3523
02:07:18.596 --> 02:07:19.429
TRAVIS: Right.

3524
02:07:20.608 --> 02:07:21.918
TALIESIN: I mean, that was--

3525
02:07:21.918 --> 02:07:23.143
LAURA: That's true, he did use Identify,

3526
02:07:23.143 --> 02:07:25.185
he would have known.

3527
02:07:25.185 --> 02:07:26.935
SAM: All right, so, we've made our hut.

3528
02:07:26.935 --> 02:07:28.535
We're going to sleep?

3529
02:07:28.535 --> 02:07:30.547
TALIESIN: Fjord, if you've got a second.

3530
02:07:30.547 --> 02:07:31.549
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

3531
02:07:31.549 --> 02:07:33.850
TALIESIN: Talk outside if a second.

3532
02:07:33.850 --> 02:07:35.255
TRAVIS: Sure.

3533
02:07:36.138 --> 02:07:40.413
MATT: You guys walk out, the light has dimmed.

3534
02:07:40.413 --> 02:07:44.044
There's just that faint bit of silvery light

3535
02:07:44.044 --> 02:07:46.190
that crests the white snow in the fields

3536
02:07:46.190 --> 02:07:49.682
down below the mountain on the edge of it.

3537
02:07:49.682 --> 02:07:52.265
Night is coming rather rapidly.

3538
02:07:54.221 --> 02:07:56.613
TALIESIN: I know you're having a hard time with everything,

3539
02:07:56.613 --> 02:08:00.505
and I know you have a lot of questions.

3540
02:08:02.542 --> 02:08:04.333
My family

3541
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:09.080
came originally from

3542
02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:10.858
disciples of one god

3543
02:08:10.858 --> 02:08:15.783
and we were given to another, and then that goddess

3544
02:08:16.888 --> 02:08:20.188
has put us in the service

3545
02:08:20.188 --> 02:08:23.944
of yet another.

3546
02:08:23.944 --> 02:08:26.014
While we do worship the Wildmother,

3547
02:08:26.014 --> 02:08:28.051
and we are clerics of the Wildmother,

3548
02:08:28.051 --> 02:08:32.536
and followers of the Wildmother, and paladins and otherwise,

3549
02:08:32.536 --> 02:08:35.251
I am so sorry, my bag is just going everywhere.

3550
02:08:35.251 --> 02:08:37.766
I'm pulling things out and setting a thing up anyway,

3551
02:08:37.766 --> 02:08:39.246
so it all works.

3552
02:08:39.246 --> 02:08:41.413
Setting up a little thing.

3553
02:08:42.334 --> 02:08:46.967
One of the prime--

3554
02:08:46.967 --> 02:08:48.433
prime tenants of what we do

3555
02:08:48.433 --> 02:08:53.161
is we're about gift giving, and we are

3556
02:08:53.161 --> 02:08:58.144
the Wildmother's expression of joy and bounty.

3557
02:08:59.568 --> 02:09:02.598
I know that she has seen you,

3558
02:09:02.598 --> 02:09:07.022
and deemed you worthy of her consideration.

3559
02:09:08.521 --> 02:09:10.685
I'm very, very glad that she has decided

3560
02:09:10.685 --> 02:09:13.458
to take you through this next part of your voyage

3561
02:09:13.458 --> 02:09:15.534
towards whoever you're going to be,

3562
02:09:15.534 --> 02:09:19.537
but part of what we do, the Clays,

3563
02:09:19.537 --> 02:09:22.348
is about finding what's true for you,

3564
02:09:22.348 --> 02:09:27.161
and it may be her, or it may be another deity,

3565
02:09:27.161 --> 02:09:31.419
it, may not be, but

3566
02:09:31.419 --> 02:09:33.002
she is here to help you

3567
02:09:33.002 --> 02:09:36.904
become who you need to be, but you don't necessarily

3568
02:09:36.904 --> 02:09:39.210
need to end up in her charge, and that may not be

3569
02:09:39.210 --> 02:09:43.814
what we're trying to blossom within you.

3570
02:09:43.814 --> 02:09:46.332
You may be a gift for another god.

3571
02:09:46.332 --> 02:09:50.113
TRAVIS: You said you were, you worshiped one god

3572
02:09:50.113 --> 02:09:54.196
and then were gifted to another and then another?

3573
02:09:55.532 --> 02:09:59.161
TALIESIN: The Raven Queen was
our original patron, the Clays,

3574
02:09:59.161 --> 02:10:03.917
and when we asked questions about

3575
02:10:03.917 --> 02:10:08.637
what she would want from us, she sent us to the Wildmother,

3576
02:10:08.637 --> 02:10:12.787
and we became her-- well,

3577
02:10:12.787 --> 02:10:14.965
we became her charges,

3578
02:10:14.965 --> 02:10:17.925
and when we asked the Wildmother what she would have of us,

3579
02:10:17.925 --> 02:10:21.542
we became the makers of fine gifts.

3580
02:10:22.554 --> 02:10:24.527
Graves are gifts.

3581
02:10:24.527 --> 02:10:25.535
TRAVIS: Oh.

3582
02:10:26.853 --> 02:10:30.166
TALIESIN: Often for the living and for those who remain,

3583
02:10:30.166 --> 02:10:31.624
but also,

3584
02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:36.207
the gods and goddesses have to talk to each other

3585
02:10:36.207 --> 02:10:37.835
and communicate with each other,

3586
02:10:37.835 --> 02:10:39.538
and one of the ways that they do that

3587
02:10:39.538 --> 02:10:43.979
is by reminding themselves that they are

3588
02:10:45.015 --> 02:10:48.321
all part of a larger tapestry and interconnected.

3589
02:10:48.321 --> 02:10:51.904
You can't have civilization without nature,

3590
02:10:53.066 --> 02:10:56.370
you can't have a storm without nature,

3591
02:10:56.370 --> 02:10:58.028
you can't have

3592
02:11:00.136 --> 02:11:03.820
stories and dreams without civilization.

3593
02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:06.001
All these things, they have to connect to each other,

3594
02:11:06.001 --> 02:11:08.887
and sometimes it's about finding out

3595
02:11:08.887 --> 02:11:11.439
where something's supposed to be.

3596
02:11:11.439 --> 02:11:13.724
I'm casting Commune.

3597
02:11:13.724 --> 02:11:14.557
MATT: Okay.

3598
02:11:15.734 --> 02:11:18.739
TALIESIN: I'm going to let you speak to her.

3599
02:11:18.739 --> 02:11:19.572
TRAVIS: To who?

3600
02:11:19.572 --> 02:11:21.239
TALIESIN: To the Wildmother.

3601
02:11:22.166 --> 02:11:25.374
You have three questions.

3602
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:31.153
The answers will be simple, just yes and no,

3603
02:11:31.153 --> 02:11:34.032
simple positives or negatives.

3604
02:11:34.032 --> 02:11:38.307
But if you want, and it can be--

3605
02:11:38.307 --> 02:11:40.107
I know we have a lot here,

3606
02:11:40.107 --> 02:11:42.568
and if you have any questions about what we're getting into,

3607
02:11:42.568 --> 02:11:45.992
that's fine, but I wanted to give you the opportunity of

3608
02:11:45.992 --> 02:11:49.425
maybe clarifying something that's inside of you.

3609
02:11:50.644 --> 02:11:52.485
TRAVIS: Right, three questions,

3610
02:11:52.485 --> 02:11:56.251
simple yes or no answers.

3611
02:11:57.501 --> 02:11:59.501
TALIESIN: Or complex yes or nos.

3612
02:12:01.644 --> 02:12:02.921
TRAVIS: All right.

3613
02:12:02.921 --> 02:12:05.827
TALIESIN: I have set up a small, little fire

3614
02:12:05.827 --> 02:12:09.204
and I'm breathing in the incense and starting my trance.

3615
02:12:09.204 --> 02:12:10.037
MATT: Okay.

3616
02:12:14.277 --> 02:12:18.361
TRAVIS: I have felt

3617
02:12:18.361 --> 02:12:22.176
your presence, Wildmother.

3618
02:12:24.977 --> 02:12:28.885
Is there a reason that you intervened

3619
02:12:28.885 --> 02:12:33.410
in my particular journey?

3620
02:12:36.896 --> 02:12:39.521
MATT: You carry this question on?
TALIESIN: I do.

3621
02:12:41.085 --> 02:12:42.784
TALIESIN: Just bring along.
MATT: Yeah.

3622
02:12:42.784 --> 02:12:45.108
The warmth of her presence comes and encircles you

3623
02:12:45.108 --> 02:12:48.907
and the biting cold of the growing night fades

3624
02:12:48.907 --> 02:12:51.978
around both of you, though you do not have

3625
02:12:51.978 --> 02:12:55.876
a direct connection, there is a presence

3626
02:12:55.876 --> 02:12:59.503
and a warmth that unexpectedly encircles your space,

3627
02:12:59.503 --> 02:13:02.670
beyond just the small fire you've set.

3628
02:13:04.592 --> 02:13:07.914
The answer comes through unclear.

3629
02:13:07.914 --> 02:13:10.500
TALIESIN: I think it's the wrong question.

3630
02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:14.686
I don't think that that has that kind of answer.

3631
02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:16.103
TRAVIS: Wrong question.

3632
02:13:20.663 --> 02:13:25.235
I miss having the ability to affect greater change

3633
02:13:25.235 --> 02:13:30.127
by having more at my fingertips.

3634
02:13:31.137 --> 02:13:35.537
If I were to change the way that I live,

3635
02:13:37.047 --> 02:13:42.047
change what I focus on, or do, would you be able

3636
02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:46.521
to help me regain some sort of standing in a way

3637
02:13:46.521 --> 02:13:49.604
that's similar to what I knew before?

3638
02:13:53.039 --> 02:13:58.039
MATT: The warmth becomes a

3639
02:13:58.073 --> 02:14:01.681
jovial understanding,

3640
02:14:01.681 --> 02:14:06.681
and the wind picks up slightly around you,

3641
02:14:06.710 --> 02:14:09.227
but it's a warm wind, and you swear for a second

3642
02:14:09.227 --> 02:14:12.866
you see a green leaf or two scatter by

3643
02:14:12.866 --> 02:14:17.041
before vanishing into the shadow of night.

3644
02:14:17.041 --> 02:14:21.274
The answer appears to be a definitive yes.

3645
02:14:22.801 --> 02:14:24.809
TALIESIN: I think so.

3646
02:14:24.809 --> 02:14:26.540
Something akin.

3647
02:14:29.171 --> 02:14:33.052
TRAVIS: Oh god, I have so many more questions.

3648
02:14:33.052 --> 02:14:35.802
Why did I ask a stupid one first?

3649
02:14:39.533 --> 02:14:43.257
I don't know about any of this.

3650
02:14:43.257 --> 02:14:46.203
It's all a bit overwhelming.

3651
02:14:46.203 --> 02:14:50.220
Cities and nature and deities overlapping.

3652
02:14:52.874 --> 02:14:55.215
Would you please

3653
02:14:59.052 --> 02:15:02.221
do something or show me something

3654
02:15:02.221 --> 02:15:07.212
or intervene or take agency in

3655
02:15:08.463 --> 02:15:13.463
my life and show me how best to move

3656
02:15:14.221 --> 02:15:17.613
towards achieving that sort of change?

3657
02:15:19.370 --> 02:15:21.620
TALIESIN: (chuckles)

3658
02:15:23.827 --> 02:15:27.702
MATT: The warmth has almost like

3659
02:15:28.727 --> 02:15:31.618
a gentle breeze passing through the bows of a tree,

3660
02:15:31.618 --> 02:15:33.726
like a forest sighing,

3661
02:15:33.726 --> 02:15:37.872
and it very much has a playful sigh to it.

3662
02:15:38.873 --> 02:15:40.873
The answer comes through

3663
02:15:42.168 --> 02:15:46.477
unclear, but asking.

3664
02:15:46.477 --> 02:15:49.341
You understand the answer, as you are a man of faith,

3665
02:15:49.341 --> 02:15:53.008
to know that the answer is to require faith.

3666
02:15:54.370 --> 02:15:57.827
TALIESIN: I mean, Fjord, I could answer that one,

3667
02:15:57.827 --> 02:16:00.417
what do you think this is?

3668
02:16:00.417 --> 02:16:03.968
All of us, me here, you here, these people.

3669
02:16:03.968 --> 02:16:05.718
This is intervention.

3670
02:16:09.287 --> 02:16:10.453
TRAVIS: Right.

3671
02:16:13.344 --> 02:16:14.644
TALIESIN: Eventually, one day,

3672
02:16:14.644 --> 02:16:17.860
somebody will pray for a miracle,

3673
02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:22.860
pray for something to save them to whatever gods are nearby,

3674
02:16:22.893 --> 02:16:26.733
and that prayer will be answered because you'll show up.

3675
02:16:26.733 --> 02:16:31.300
That's how it works. That's what a champion is.

3676
02:16:33.132 --> 02:16:35.715
TRAVIS: How often do you talk to her?

3677
02:16:37.383 --> 02:16:42.141
TALIESIN: I mean, never stop.

3678
02:16:46.181 --> 02:16:49.998
TRAVIS: I don't have your stuff.

3679
02:16:51.678 --> 02:16:54.761
TALIESIN: Even for my family, I'm a little...

3680
02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:00.153
TRAVIS: A little eccentric?

3681
02:17:00.153 --> 02:17:02.403
TALIESIN: That's a good word, yeah.

3682
02:17:03.705 --> 02:17:07.538
TRAVIS: Without all of that, is it still possible to

3683
02:17:09.221 --> 02:17:12.221
talk to her?

3684
02:17:12.221 --> 02:17:14.019
TALIESIN: She's always listening.

3685
02:17:14.019 --> 02:17:15.069
TRAVIS: She is?

3686
02:17:15.069 --> 02:17:16.405
TALIESIN: Yeah, the answers that you get

3687
02:17:16.405 --> 02:17:18.852
may not be the ones you want, and the answers may come

3688
02:17:18.852 --> 02:17:22.063
in ways that you don't necessarily understand

3689
02:17:22.063 --> 02:17:26.563
or are almost too obvious to see.

3690
02:17:26.563 --> 02:17:30.578
The answers may be that you need to find

3691
02:17:30.578 --> 02:17:32.001
where your power is.

3692
02:17:32.001 --> 02:17:34.822
Where is the place that you are strongest?

3693
02:17:34.822 --> 02:17:37.395
And nature is very big.

3694
02:17:37.395 --> 02:17:42.253
And you are a mystery, in many ways.

3695
02:17:43.599 --> 02:17:48.031
I think inevitably, something's going to come out

3696
02:17:48.031 --> 02:17:51.888
and show itself within you, and that'll be the moment

3697
02:17:51.888 --> 02:17:56.888
you know that what element of righteousness

3698
02:17:56.913 --> 02:17:59.764
you were supposed to champion and represent.

3699
02:17:59.764 --> 02:18:03.147
What is the thing that inspires you?

3700
02:18:03.147 --> 02:18:06.169
TRAVIS: I love the oceans. I always have.

3701
02:18:06.169 --> 02:18:08.963
TALIESIN: What do you like about the oceans?

3702
02:18:08.963 --> 02:18:11.467
TRAVIS: You can get lost out there.

3703
02:18:11.467 --> 02:18:14.136
It's easy to fall away from everything else.

3704
02:18:14.136 --> 02:18:18.996
It's calming, it's meditative, it's humbling.

3705
02:18:18.996 --> 02:18:23.512
You're at the mercy of, well, the elements.

3706
02:18:24.390 --> 02:18:27.640
Perhaps the greatest one on this plane.

3707
02:18:28.578 --> 02:18:29.569
TALIESIN: What do you dream about

3708
02:18:29.569 --> 02:18:31.460
when your dreams are your own?

3709
02:18:33.701 --> 02:18:36.001
TRAVIS: It's been so long.

3710
02:18:37.982 --> 02:18:39.397
I don't know what I dream about,

3711
02:18:39.397 --> 02:18:42.188
but I used to remember going down to the shore

3712
02:18:42.188 --> 02:18:44.994
and just enjoying the sound of the ocean.

3713
02:18:44.994 --> 02:18:47.068
It would wipe out everything else.

3714
02:18:47.068 --> 02:18:48.516
It's calming there.

3715
02:18:48.516 --> 02:18:50.680
It's also powerful.

3716
02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:52.258
Seeing things wash up on the shore,

3717
02:18:52.258 --> 02:18:56.174
be pulverized, made into smaller pieces.

3718
02:18:56.174 --> 02:18:57.507
It's relentless.

3719
02:18:59.388 --> 02:19:04.254
TALIESIN: Maybe when you were lost on that ship,

3720
02:19:04.254 --> 02:19:06.959
you were heading towards something good and perfect

3721
02:19:06.959 --> 02:19:10.985
at the bottom of the ocean, and maybe you just got

3722
02:19:10.985 --> 02:19:14.392
caught by something that was down there

3723
02:19:14.392 --> 02:19:16.992
hoping to catch something.

3724
02:19:16.992 --> 02:19:20.565
Heading towards that purity, that goodness.

3725
02:19:21.814 --> 02:19:23.470
Maybe there's still something down there

3726
02:19:23.470 --> 02:19:27.970
that's what you're describing.

3727
02:19:29.045 --> 02:19:33.147
And not that thing that was a corruption of it.

3728
02:19:33.147 --> 02:19:34.447
TRAVIS: Maybe.

3729
02:19:35.459 --> 02:19:40.459
That reminds me, I should've asked if

3730
02:19:41.142 --> 02:19:43.877
Uk'otoa is finished with me or not.

3731
02:19:43.877 --> 02:19:44.710
MARISHA: (whispered) Uk'otoa.

3732
02:19:46.514 --> 02:19:48.878
TALIESIN: Oh, I can answer that.

3733
02:19:48.878 --> 02:19:49.711
No.

3734
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:53.906
TRAVIS: What do you mean, no?

3735
02:19:53.906 --> 02:19:56.156
TALIESIN: Why would he be finished?

3736
02:19:57.187 --> 02:19:59.045
TRAVIS: I don't...

3737
02:19:59.045 --> 02:20:02.795
I don't have the key or the sword,

3738
02:20:02.795 --> 02:20:05.795
or any gifts.

3739
02:20:10.641 --> 02:20:13.581
TALIESIN: I think that might not be a story that's over yet.

3740
02:20:13.581 --> 02:20:15.203
That may be something you are battling

3741
02:20:15.203 --> 02:20:17.626
for the rest of your life.

3742
02:20:17.626 --> 02:20:21.986
But we're going to arm you, and you're going to be fine.

3743
02:20:21.986 --> 02:20:25.887
But no, this isn't gone. It's just sleeping.

3744
02:20:25.887 --> 02:20:26.720
TRAVIS: Great.

3745
02:20:27.973 --> 02:20:29.939
Good, yes.

3746
02:20:29.939 --> 02:20:33.933
TALIESIN: It's good it's angry at you.

3747
02:20:33.933 --> 02:20:35.290
Maybe it means that it fears you.

3748
02:20:35.290 --> 02:20:37.257
TRAVIS: Oh, mmm.

3749
02:20:37.257 --> 02:20:38.657
TALIESIN: Maybe it's right to.

3750
02:20:39.508 --> 02:20:40.996
TRAVIS: (sighs)

3751
02:20:40.996 --> 02:20:42.775
I wish that were true.

3752
02:20:42.775 --> 02:20:47.369
If I wanted to learn more about all these deities

3753
02:20:47.369 --> 02:20:52.252
that seem to trade amongst us, like cards,

3754
02:20:53.217 --> 02:20:54.662
how would I do that?

3755
02:20:54.662 --> 02:20:58.245
TALIESIN: Well, there's the big ones, the ones that are

3756
02:20:58.245 --> 02:20:59.878
the big ideas.

3757
02:21:01.195 --> 02:21:04.399
Entities that rule large swaths of the world--

3758
02:21:04.399 --> 02:21:06.959
TRAVIS: Yeah, I read that book when we were waiting

3759
02:21:06.959 --> 02:21:08.267
about the Calamity and the

3760
02:21:08.267 --> 02:21:12.399
Betrayer Gods, and all of that.

3761
02:21:12.399 --> 02:21:15.807
Does that serve as a menu

3762
02:21:15.807 --> 02:21:18.583
of things to choose from?

3763
02:21:18.583 --> 02:21:20.235
TALIESIN: Well, there's no menu, you may--

3764
02:21:20.235 --> 02:21:24.019
TRAVIS: Uk'otoa was not in that book.

3765
02:21:24.019 --> 02:21:26.927
TALIESIN: It's a very big world,

3766
02:21:26.927 --> 02:21:29.718
and there are lots of little ideas

3767
02:21:29.718 --> 02:21:32.036
looking for champions, and there are lots of big ideas

3768
02:21:32.036 --> 02:21:37.015
looking for champions, and maybe something that

3769
02:21:37.015 --> 02:21:41.024
we don't know about, like a Traveler,

3770
02:21:41.024 --> 02:21:43.173
might come your way, or maybe a big idea

3771
02:21:43.173 --> 02:21:44.818
will get ahold of you, I don't know.

3772
02:21:44.818 --> 02:21:49.163
TRAVIS: Good, good, good, yes, more unknown. I like it.

3773
02:21:49.163 --> 02:21:50.091
TALIESIN: You will.

3774
02:21:50.091 --> 02:21:51.424
It'll feel good.

3775
02:21:53.443 --> 02:21:57.392
TRAVIS: Thank you, I know you don't have to do any of this.

3776
02:21:57.392 --> 02:21:59.227
It's very much appreciated.

3777
02:21:59.227 --> 02:22:03.666
TALIESIN: I am your sign from the Wildmother.

3778
02:22:03.666 --> 02:22:05.418
This is what I'm doing.

3779
02:22:05.418 --> 02:22:07.205
This is what I'm supposed to do.

3780
02:22:07.205 --> 02:22:09.990
You asked for a sign and this is it.

3781
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:11.048
We're going to keep doing this.

3782
02:22:11.048 --> 02:22:13.897
We're going to keep meditating,

3783
02:22:13.897 --> 02:22:17.336
keep looking for the thing that you need.

3784
02:22:17.336 --> 02:22:19.643
Starting with the sword.

3785
02:22:19.643 --> 02:22:21.193
TRAVIS: Yes.

3786
02:22:21.193 --> 02:22:24.001
I'm all for that.

3787
02:22:24.001 --> 02:22:24.912
Thank you.

3788
02:22:24.912 --> 02:22:26.412
TALIESIN: It's worthwhile.

3789
02:22:27.881 --> 02:22:29.893
Oh god, it got cold.

3790
02:22:29.893 --> 02:22:32.165
TRAVIS: I'm actually quite warm.

3791
02:22:32.165 --> 02:22:34.451
TALIESIN: I'm going inside.

3792
02:22:34.451 --> 02:22:36.201
I have no meat on me.

3793
02:22:37.549 --> 02:22:39.093
MATT: You head inside?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

3794
02:22:39.093 --> 02:22:40.289
MATT: You head inside?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

3795
02:22:40.289 --> 02:22:41.321
MATT: Okay.

3796
02:22:41.321 --> 02:22:43.759
TRAVIS: A quick look out to the horizon

3797
02:22:43.759 --> 02:22:45.330
just to see if there are any shapes.

3798
02:22:45.330 --> 02:22:47.063
MATT: Perception check.

3799
02:22:48.958 --> 02:22:49.946
TRAVIS: 20.

3800
02:22:49.946 --> 02:22:51.335
MATT: 20.

3801
02:22:51.335 --> 02:22:53.621
It is dark, so at disadvantage, technically.

3802
02:22:53.621 --> 02:22:56.531
Although you have darkvision, so, yeah, you're fine.

3803
02:22:56.531 --> 02:22:57.823
TRAVIS: 60.
MATT: 60 feet out.

3804
02:22:57.823 --> 02:23:00.081
Within 60 feet you don't see anything,

3805
02:23:00.081 --> 02:23:02.458
other than just the perpetual storm,

3806
02:23:02.458 --> 02:23:04.584
and the storm is perpetual, it doesn't swell,

3807
02:23:04.584 --> 02:23:07.853
it doesn't go away, it just seems like in this proximity

3808
02:23:07.853 --> 02:23:12.849
there is just a constant blowing of snow and wind.

3809
02:23:12.849 --> 02:23:17.416
TRAVIS: I wonder if that's because of our honored guest.

3810
02:23:18.925 --> 02:23:20.174
I go inside.

3811
02:23:20.174 --> 02:23:21.929
MATT: All right.

3812
02:23:21.929 --> 02:23:24.217
You guys all rest up for the night? Full long rest?

3813
02:23:24.217 --> 02:23:25.158
Okay.

3814
02:23:25.158 --> 02:23:27.582
In the comfort of the dome, you take your eight hours

3815
02:23:27.582 --> 02:23:32.245
of rest, give or take a few minutes and excursions,

3816
02:23:32.245 --> 02:23:34.379
and as you wake up in the morning,

3817
02:23:34.379 --> 02:23:36.062
we're going to go ahead and take a break.
(low cheer)

3818
02:23:36.062 --> 02:23:37.824
MATT: Let's pick it up from there.

3819
02:23:37.824 --> 02:23:41.230
See where that stands and where your morning takes you.

3820
02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:43.799
We have our giveaway of tonight.

3821
02:23:43.799 --> 02:23:46.224
It is the black walnut dice vault

3822
02:23:46.224 --> 02:23:47.972
from our friends at Wyrmwood.

3823
02:23:47.972 --> 02:23:50.130
One lucky winner in the chat will get this.

3824
02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:52.195
The keyword tonight is celestial.

3825
02:23:52.195 --> 02:23:53.445
TRAVIS: Ooh, celestial.
SAM: Celestial.

3826
02:23:53.445 --> 02:23:56.900
MATT: C-E-L-E-T-- S-T-I-A-L.

3827
02:23:56.900 --> 02:24:00.483
Because I messed it up, C-E-L-E-S-T-I-A-L.

3828
02:24:00.483 --> 02:24:03.471
We'll have a winner here-- put it once in the chat,

3829
02:24:03.471 --> 02:24:04.448
more than once, you're disqualified,

3830
02:24:04.448 --> 02:24:07.111
once again, US and Canada only, excluding Quebec.

3831
02:24:07.111 --> 02:24:08.390
We'll have you guys back here shortly

3832
02:24:08.390 --> 02:24:09.884
and see who's the winner.

3833
02:24:09.884 --> 02:24:10.996
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah!

3834
02:24:10.996 --> 02:24:12.107
(cheering)

3835
02:24:12.107 --> 02:24:13.589
MATT: Perfect.

3836
02:24:13.589 --> 02:24:15.127

(eerie music)

3856
02:25:11.022 --> 02:25:13.349
BINWIN: Hi, I'm Binwin Bronzebottom, celebrity dwarf

3857
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:16.335
and video game enthusiast, and this is my sidekick Crowy.

3858
02:25:16.335 --> 02:25:17.856
CROWY: Hello.
BINWIN: We're here to tell you about

3859
02:25:17.856 --> 02:25:19.827
Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms,

3860
02:25:19.827 --> 02:25:22.270
a Dungeons &amp; Dragons based strategy management game

3861
02:25:22.270 --> 02:25:23.781
from Code Name Entertainment.

3862
02:25:23.781 --> 02:25:26.048
They're Canadian, so you know it's good.

3863
02:25:26.048 --> 02:25:27.151
CROWY: Let's talk about the game.

3864
02:25:27.151 --> 02:25:28.319
Did you ever play Cookie Clicker?

3865
02:25:28.319 --> 02:25:29.307
BINWIN: Of course not.

3866
02:25:29.307 --> 02:25:30.875
CROWY: This game is a management game like that,

3867
02:25:30.875 --> 02:25:32.573
but with far more emphasis on strategy,

3868
02:25:32.573 --> 02:25:35.125
and with a flavory of D&amp;D's lore and legendary heroes,

3869
02:25:35.125 --> 02:25:36.807
you can unlock your favorite champions,

3870
02:25:36.807 --> 02:25:39.659
like Farideh from Erin M. Evans' Brimstone Angels saga,

3871
02:25:39.659 --> 02:25:41.467
Minsc and Boo from Baldur's Gate,

3872
02:25:41.467 --> 02:25:42.527
and the fourth and final member

3873
02:25:42.527 --> 02:25:44.066
of Acquisitions Incorporated The C-Team,

3874
02:25:44.066 --> 02:25:46.693
Amy Falcone's Walnut Dankgrass.

3875
02:25:46.693 --> 02:25:47.848
BINWIN: The K is silent.

3876
02:25:47.848 --> 02:25:49.716
CROWY: Create the best adventuring party possible

3877
02:25:49.716 --> 02:25:52.165
based on formation options, your character's ability,

3878
02:25:52.165 --> 02:25:53.902
and the obstacles and enemies you face.

3879
02:25:53.902 --> 02:25:56.091
BINWIN: Or you just randomly click on things like I do

3880
02:25:56.091 --> 02:25:57.135
and hope for the best.

3881
02:25:57.135 --> 02:25:58.768
CROWY: You can click on enemies to assist your champions,

3882
02:25:58.768 --> 02:26:00.322
or you can set 'em up and walk away

3883
02:26:00.322 --> 02:26:02.316
and let 'em do their thing, it's entirely up to you.

3884
02:26:02.316 --> 02:26:04.011
BINWIN: I'm playing on the toilet right now.

3885
02:26:04.011 --> 02:26:05.228
CROWY: Why wouldn't you be?

3886
02:26:05.228 --> 02:26:07.328
Idle Champions is available on all your favorite

3887
02:26:07.328 --> 02:26:09.021
gaming platforms, including tablets,

3888
02:26:09.021 --> 02:26:11.263
for the low, low price of free.

3889
02:26:11.263 --> 02:26:12.268
So download it now.

3890
02:26:12.268 --> 02:26:13.229
BINWIN: End it with joke.

3891
02:26:13.229 --> 02:26:14.132
CROWY: You're not supposed to read that.

3892
02:26:14.132 --> 02:26:14.973
BINWIN: It says "end with joke."

3893
02:26:14.973 --> 02:26:16.813
CROWY: No, we're supposed to come up with a joke to go with

3894
02:26:16.813 --> 02:26:18.255
where it says "end with joke."

3895
02:26:18.255 --> 02:26:20.014
BINWIN: Oh, I don't know, "end with joke" is pretty funny.

3896
02:26:20.014 --> 02:26:21.270
CROWY: Wait, on three, ready?

3897
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:22.895
BINWIN: Yeah.
CROWY: One, two, three.

3898
02:26:22.895 --> 02:26:24.119
BOTH: End with joke.

3899
02:26:24.119 --> 02:26:25.424
(laughter)

3900
02:26:25.424 --> 02:26:29.382
BINWIN: I think it's funny, very funny.

3901
02:26:29.382 --> 02:26:31.950
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time, on Talks Machina.

3902
02:26:31.950 --> 02:26:33.903
MICA: I've always like, loved role play,

3903
02:26:33.903 --> 02:26:36.976
because I have an acting major, so I've loved

3904
02:26:36.976 --> 02:26:40.515
the improv and stuff like that for ages,

3905
02:26:40.515 --> 02:26:42.648
and so the fact that D&amp;D is just like,

3906
02:26:42.648 --> 02:26:46.473
all the things I love, fantasy, improv, like dice.

3907
02:26:46.473 --> 02:26:48.875
Love dice, oh my god! I have an addiction to them.

3908
02:26:48.875 --> 02:26:50.863
BRIAN: Yeah, I couldn't tell, because I watched it

3909
02:26:50.863 --> 02:26:53.694
on a very small device. How much dice

3910
02:26:53.694 --> 02:26:55.286
did you bring with you, because there was obviously

3911
02:26:55.286 --> 02:26:56.749
a reaction from Laura.

3912
02:26:56.749 --> 02:26:59.760
MICA: I only brought, like, a fourth of my dice collection.

3913
02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:03.141
BRIAN: For real?
MICA: A good chonky set of them,

3914
02:27:03.141 --> 02:27:04.528
but it was all my prettiest ones.

3915
02:27:04.528 --> 02:27:06.912
So I picked through the night before Critical Role.

3916
02:27:06.912 --> 02:27:08.218
It was like my first day of school,

3917
02:27:08.218 --> 02:27:09.824
I was like, I got to get my dice ready,

3918
02:27:09.824 --> 02:27:11.081
I got to get my outfit ready.

3919
02:27:11.081 --> 02:27:13.159
BRIAN: My highlighters, my binder.
MICA: I got to get my Trapper Keeper

3920
02:27:13.159 --> 02:27:15.380
and all of that. So I picked all my prettiest dice

3921
02:27:15.380 --> 02:27:16.820
and I brought it with me.

3922
02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:19.127
MARISHA: It's been very difficult to separate

3923
02:27:19.127 --> 02:27:22.743
Beau's feelings from mine, because

3924
02:27:22.743 --> 02:27:24.710
you know when Travis,

3925
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:27.651
when Ashley was playing a barbarian in those early games,

3926
02:27:27.651 --> 02:27:30.099
and Travis kept being like, "My child."

3927
02:27:30.099 --> 02:27:31.018
BRIAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3928
02:27:31.018 --> 02:27:33.689
MARISHA: So I have similar like druid vibes.

3929
02:27:33.689 --> 02:27:36.473
Especially when you were talking about curling up as a dog,

3930
02:27:36.473 --> 02:27:38.142
because I used to do that as Minxy.

3931
02:27:38.142 --> 02:27:39.814
MICA: No way, oh my god!
MARISHA: Uh-huh!

3932
02:27:39.814 --> 02:27:41.364
MARISHA: I'd go into my animal forms,

3933
02:27:41.364 --> 02:27:43.925
and then you were like, "It's so comfy," and I was like--

3934
02:27:43.925 --> 02:27:45.668
MICA: It is so comfy. You get it!

3935
02:27:45.668 --> 02:27:46.651
MARISHA: She knows.

3936
02:27:46.651 --> 02:27:50.964
So yeah, so I keep being like (gasps).

3937
02:27:50.964 --> 02:27:52.871
(groaning)

3938
02:27:52.871 --> 02:27:55.796
Because I think Beau is--

3939
02:27:55.796 --> 02:27:58.895
she finds you very endearing

3940
02:27:58.895 --> 02:28:03.009
and charming, but also Beau kind of thinks

3941
02:28:03.009 --> 02:28:05.501
Reani might be a psycho.
MICA: Valid.

3942
02:28:05.501 --> 02:28:08.451
MARISHA: So that's kind of where she is.

3943
02:28:08.451 --> 02:28:10.862
MICA: New poisons open up new opportunities, like--

3944
02:28:10.862 --> 02:28:11.825
BRIAN: I've been saying that for years.

3945
02:28:11.825 --> 02:28:12.658
MICA: Right? You know.

3946
02:28:12.658 --> 02:28:14.929
Fast-acting poisons, slow-acting poisons,

3947
02:28:14.929 --> 02:28:16.851
gross poisons, like Game of Thrones poisons

3948
02:28:16.851 --> 02:28:19.494
where it's like ooh, purple face, like really painful.

3949
02:28:19.494 --> 02:28:20.843
BRIAN: Retirement home poisons.

3950
02:28:20.843 --> 02:28:22.590
MICA: Retirement home poisons, mothballs.

3951
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:23.692
BRIAN: Puddin' poisons.

3952
02:28:23.692 --> 02:28:25.568
MICA: Puddin' poisons. You can get frozen poisons,

3953
02:28:25.568 --> 02:28:29.227
give it to them in the Otter Pop, exactly.

3954
02:28:29.227 --> 02:28:30.466
BRIAN: I mean, we don't really,

3955
02:28:30.466 --> 02:28:31.641
those are made from otters, right?

3956
02:28:31.641 --> 02:28:33.268
MICA: Yeah, absolutely, ground up otters.

3957
02:28:33.268 --> 02:28:34.405
BRIAN: Wow, dirty.

3958
02:28:34.405 --> 02:28:36.152
DANI: Wow.
BRIAN: How do you grind 'em up, in a blender?

3959
02:28:36.152 --> 02:28:37.985
MICA: No, in one of those wood chippers.

3960
02:28:37.985 --> 02:28:39.110
MARISHA: Poor otters!

3961
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:42.769
No, it's all comes full circle!

3962
02:28:42.769 --> 02:28:44.718
MICA: That's what their slick bodies are for.

3963
02:28:44.718 --> 02:28:46.442
BRIAN: Like a New York City trash bag

3964
02:28:46.442 --> 02:28:48.253
into the back of the thing, just--

3965
02:28:48.253 --> 02:28:51.453
MARISHA: That's what the woodcutter otters are!

3966
02:28:51.453 --> 02:28:53.366
MICA: They're just Otter Pops.

3967
02:28:53.366 --> 02:28:54.595
They're otter pops!

3968
02:28:54.595 --> 02:28:59.056
MARISHA: Matt was highly complimentary of you, by the way,

3969
02:28:59.056 --> 02:29:01.153
before we even got on the show--

3970
02:29:01.153 --> 02:29:02.030
MICA: Cue me crying.

3971
02:29:02.030 --> 02:29:06.415
MARISHA: Because you apparently
sent in a four-page backstory.

3972
02:29:06.415 --> 02:29:10.189
MICA: I did, yeah.
BRIAN: Jesus Christ, good for you.

3973
02:29:10.189 --> 02:29:13.279
MARISHA: Matt, in the way that he does, just came

3974
02:29:13.279 --> 02:29:15.521
careening out of his office in our room

3975
02:29:15.521 --> 02:29:17.994
and he went, "I love Mica Burton."

3976
02:29:17.994 --> 02:29:19.231
(laughter)

3977
02:29:19.231 --> 02:29:21.040
BRIAN: CritRole.com

3978
02:29:22.777 --> 02:29:24.035
slash

3979
02:29:25.424 --> 02:29:26.939
submit.

3980
02:29:26.939 --> 02:29:29.335
Rules for our contest are available at CritRole.com,

3981
02:29:29.335 --> 02:29:30.379
that's our website.

3982
02:29:30.379 --> 02:29:33.013
Why are you making that face?

3983
02:29:33.013 --> 02:29:37.482
MARISHA: She doesn't, I'm living--
MICA: No one told me.

3984
02:29:37.482 --> 02:29:40.448
MARISHA: No one told her about--

3985
02:29:40.448 --> 02:29:42.772
BRIAN: Wait, do it again, do it again, make it,

3986
02:29:42.772 --> 02:29:45.301
wait, wait, no, have Mica do it.

3987
02:29:45.301 --> 02:29:46.271
MARISHA: Slash.

3988
02:29:46.271 --> 02:29:48.340
MICA: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3989
02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:49.574
All right, are you ready, are you ready?

3990
02:29:49.574 --> 02:29:50.817
BRIAN: Yeah, look at that camera.

3991
02:29:50.817 --> 02:29:53.151
MICA: Ah! Yeah!

3992
02:29:53.151 --> 02:29:57.305
BRIAN: Our winner for this week was sent in by @Koalois.

3993
02:29:57.305 --> 02:30:00.173
Wait, oh it says pronounced Koalois?

3994
02:30:00.173 --> 02:30:01.439
I did it!

3995
02:30:01.439 --> 02:30:02.272
(clapping)

3996
02:30:02.272 --> 02:30:03.232
DANI: Did you do it?

3997
02:30:03.232 --> 02:30:04.387
BRIAN: I fucking think I did it.

3998
02:30:04.387 --> 02:30:05.565
DANI: Am I proud of you for once?

3999
02:30:05.565 --> 02:30:08.708
BRIAN: Well, that's it folks, I'm leaving.

4000
02:30:08.708 --> 02:30:12.207
MARISHA: I wish we had a balloon drop just waiting

4001
02:30:12.207 --> 02:30:13.532
for so long,

4002
02:30:13.532 --> 02:30:15.158
like we know.

4003
02:30:15.158 --> 02:30:17.655
DANI: Marisha, you wanted a balloon drop for so long.

4004
02:30:17.655 --> 02:30:19.149
MARISHA: It keeps coming up.

4005
02:30:19.149 --> 02:30:20.520
MICA: Whoa!

4006
02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:24.068
MARISHA: That's it, that's the celebration we needed.

4007
02:30:24.068 --> 02:30:27.934
BRIAN: Photo by @AmynTheOutcast on Instagram,

4008
02:30:27.934 --> 02:30:29.659
let's take a look.

4009
02:30:32.121 --> 02:30:34.509
DANI: Hey, it's Jester!
MARISHA: Oh my goodness.

4010
02:30:34.509 --> 02:30:37.022
MICA: I'm 99% sure I know exactly where that was taken.

4011
02:30:37.022 --> 02:30:37.872
BRIAN: Where?
MARISHA: Really?

4012
02:30:37.872 --> 02:30:40.239
MICA: Colossal Con, at the Kalahari,

4013
02:30:40.239 --> 02:30:41.526
because I have photos in that field.

4014
02:30:41.526 --> 02:30:42.507
I know exactly where that is.

4015
02:30:42.507 --> 02:30:43.348
BRIAN: Jesus.

4016
02:30:43.348 --> 02:30:45.669
MICA: I probably passed that cosplayer at the con.

4017
02:30:45.669 --> 02:30:46.903
DANI: Also, she looks amazing.

4018
02:30:46.903 --> 02:30:49.001
MICA: She looks amazing, are you kidding me?

4019
02:30:49.001 --> 02:30:50.900
DANI: Oh no.

4020
02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:53.704
BRIAN: Wait look, this is how small it is,

4021
02:30:53.704 --> 02:30:55.990
it fits right between my fingers.

4022
02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:58.121
MICA: So tiny, look at the tiny man.

4023
02:30:58.121 --> 02:30:59.372
BRIAN: Look at the tiny man.

4024
02:30:59.372 --> 02:31:00.716
MICA: He looks like he's seen too much.

4025
02:31:00.716 --> 02:31:03.605
BRIAN: He has seen too, oh!

4026
02:31:03.605 --> 02:31:05.431
Wow.
MICA: What?

4027
02:31:05.431 --> 02:31:07.756
I'm sorry, what?

4028
02:31:07.756 --> 02:31:09.864
MARISHA: We're big sports fans on this network.

4029
02:31:09.864 --> 02:31:11.409
MICA: Oh my god, I love sportsball.

4030
02:31:11.409 --> 02:31:13.270
When you have the things with the uprights,

4031
02:31:13.270 --> 02:31:15.622
and then you put--
MARISHA: And then you--

4032
02:31:15.622 --> 02:31:18.664
BRIAN: Mica, take a look at that camera right there.

4033
02:31:18.664 --> 02:31:19.731
Hi camera.

4034
02:31:19.731 --> 02:31:22.321
BRIAN: And say "it's breaking news."

4035
02:31:22.321 --> 02:31:24.071
MICA: It's breaking news.

4036
02:31:25.473 --> 02:31:27.108
ALL: Hey!

4037
02:31:27.108 --> 02:31:29.423
(laughter)

4038
02:31:29.423 --> 02:31:31.617
MICA: That's so good, oh my god!

4039
02:31:31.617 --> 02:31:33.735
DANI: Did we put a Brian in a fucking--

4040
02:31:33.735 --> 02:31:35.293
BRIAN: No, that wasn't me.
MARISHA: Yeah, it was.

4041
02:31:35.293 --> 02:31:38.580
BRIAN: That was Tom Brady or Brad Pitt

4042
02:31:38.580 --> 02:31:39.832
or one of those guys who looks like me.

4043
02:31:39.832 --> 02:31:41.107
MICA: That was Brad Pitt.

4044
02:31:41.107 --> 02:31:42.425
DANI: Oh no.
BRIAN: Is that me?

4045
02:31:42.425 --> 02:31:43.915
MICA: That's you.

4046
02:31:43.915 --> 02:31:45.237
BRIAN: Damn it!

4047
02:31:45.237 --> 02:31:47.820
(upbeat music)

4048
02:31:57.075 --> 02:31:59.166
BRIAN: What do the Critters in the other

4049
02:31:59.166 --> 02:32:01.038
'verses say about me?

4050
02:32:01.038 --> 02:32:03.291
ASHLEY: "Shut up, you emaciated bitch!"

4051
02:32:03.291 --> 02:32:04.124
LIAM: "String bean!"

4052
02:32:04.124 --> 02:32:04.957
BRITTANY: "Bean pole!"

4053
02:32:04.957 --> 02:32:07.430
LIAM: "You sandwich-sized Ziploc full of shit."

4054
02:32:07.430 --> 02:32:10.369
ASHLEY: "You moldy, rusted spit can."

4055
02:32:10.369 --> 02:32:12.972
LIAM: "You ignorant, disgusting waste of blood cells.

4056
02:32:12.972 --> 02:32:14.983
"You're so fucking stupid, you couldn't

4057
02:32:14.983 --> 02:32:16.699
"track a giraffe in snow."

4058
02:32:16.699 --> 02:32:18.782
BRITTANY: "You re-animated trash heap!"

4059
02:32:18.782 --> 02:32:21.394
LIAM: "You disowned Olsen twin."

4060
02:32:21.394 --> 02:32:23.595
BRIAN: That doesn't sound appealing at all.

4061
02:32:23.595 --> 02:32:26.567
SAM: "Yes, not appealing, just like your shovel mouth,

4062
02:32:26.567 --> 02:32:28.295
"you ugly little dirt merchant."

4063
02:32:28.295 --> 02:32:29.953
TRAVIS: Oh. (laughter)

4064
02:32:29.953 --> 02:32:32.848
TRAVIS: Shovel mouth, dirt merchant?

4065
02:32:32.848 --> 02:32:35.364
LIAM: "I've never been happier to see your

4066
02:32:35.364 --> 02:32:39.148
"chiseled, handsome face, chosen one,

4067
02:32:39.148 --> 02:32:43.072
"and your dried-up cow shit excuse for a mug too, chestnut."

4068
02:32:43.072 --> 02:32:44.148
TRAVIS: Oh no.

4069
02:32:44.148 --> 02:32:46.481
BRIAN: But if Travis is the chosen one,

4070
02:32:46.481 --> 02:32:47.889
what does that make me?

4071
02:32:47.889 --> 02:32:49.434
BRITTANY: "A liability."

4072
02:32:49.434 --> 02:32:50.797
(laughter)

4073
02:32:50.797 --> 02:32:53.302
MARISHA: "That's the liability."

4074
02:32:53.302 --> 02:32:54.271
ASHLEY: Oh, god.

4075
02:32:54.271 --> 02:32:57.503
MARISHA: "He's a disgusting man with flesh-colored beard.

4076
02:32:57.503 --> 02:33:00.403
"He'll probably die alone because no one wants to

4077
02:33:00.403 --> 02:33:03.255
"hitch their wagon to a two-legged horse

4078
02:33:03.255 --> 02:33:05.421
"with macular degeneration

02:33:05.421 --> 02:33:07.879
and permanent resting bitch face."

4080
02:33:07.879 --> 02:33:11.087
ASHLEY: Oh, that is harsh! Man, he sounds like

4081
02:33:11.087 --> 02:33:13.825
a trough filled with shit.

4082
02:33:13.825 --> 02:33:17.389
SAM: "And remember, this isn't me saying this.

4083
02:33:17.389 --> 02:33:20.542
"They say a tether ball's pole's

4084
02:33:20.542 --> 02:33:23.307
"got more meat on it than you.

4085
02:33:23.307 --> 02:33:25.916
"That you're a malnourished, dried up

4086
02:33:25.916 --> 02:33:27.989
"volleyball-looking little fuck."

4087
02:33:27.989 --> 02:33:29.726
(laughter)

4088
02:33:29.726 --> 02:33:32.053
"Once again, keep in mind, this is not me,

4089
02:33:32.053 --> 02:33:34.900
"I am merely just a messenger of the many bards

4090
02:33:34.900 --> 02:33:35.980
"across the lands."

4091
02:33:35.980 --> 02:33:37.034
TRAVIS: I don't believe this.

4092
02:33:37.034 --> 02:33:38.200
BRIAN: Okay, okay.

4093
02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:40.291
Do all the critters hate me?

4094
02:33:40.291 --> 02:33:41.235
TRAVIS: I think so.

4095
02:33:41.235 --> 02:33:44.379
I am in their good graces, being the chosen one.

4096
02:33:44.379 --> 02:33:49.379
You, however, (clears throat) are a piece of shit.

4097
02:33:51.010 --> 02:33:53.927
(mysterious music)

4098
02:33:57.192 --> 02:34:00.013
TALIESIN: A lonely tavern set, strangely absent

4099
02:34:00.013 --> 02:34:02.783
of streaming content, its patrons waiting

4100
02:34:02.783 --> 02:34:05.669
for a way to reach their Critical Role content.

4101
02:34:05.669 --> 02:34:10.162
Travelers waiting to board the subscription train.

4102
02:34:10.162 --> 02:34:14.070
Through a twisting series of tubes and satellite waves,

4103
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:16.558
we here at Critical Role deliver digital content

4104
02:34:16.558 --> 02:34:21.558
in the form of what society has come to know as "shows."

4105
02:34:21.562 --> 02:34:24.186
If you would like to view these "shows" on demand

4106
02:34:24.186 --> 02:34:26.790
after the live premiere, you need to enter

4107
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:31.201
the shadow land known as The Twitch Subscription Zone.

4108
02:34:31.201 --> 02:34:33.586
It is simple to subscribe, but there are

4109
02:34:33.586 --> 02:34:35.481
many paths one may take.

4110
02:34:35.481 --> 02:34:39.407
This Gordian Knot can easily be cut with a credit card.

4111
02:34:39.407 --> 02:34:42.987
However, if one has an Amazon Prime account,

4112
02:34:42.987 --> 02:34:46.395
you are guaranteed one free Twitch subscription a month

4113
02:34:46.395 --> 02:34:48.999
to the channel of your choosing.

4114
02:34:48.999 --> 02:34:53.399
But remember, freedom demands agency.

4115
02:34:53.399 --> 02:34:56.629
For Twitch Prime subscriptions do not auto-renew,

4116
02:34:56.629 --> 02:34:59.858
and you must resubscribe each month.

4117
02:34:59.858 --> 02:35:02.144
For those already in the subscription zone

4118
02:35:02.144 --> 02:35:03.885
who want to spread their fortune,

4119
02:35:03.885 --> 02:35:05.942
you can gift tickets to the sub train

4120
02:35:05.942 --> 02:35:10.942
by invoking the gift a sub button on Twitch.

4121
02:35:11.173 --> 02:35:16.061
Yes, join us, there's plenty more room for Critters

4122
02:35:16.061 --> 02:35:18.436
in the shadow land.

4123
02:35:18.436 --> 02:35:20.475
We here at Critical Role want to say thank you

4124
02:35:20.475 --> 02:35:23.791
to our esteemed subscribers, and hope you enjoy

4125
02:35:23.791 --> 02:35:26.735
as much of our content as you can consume,

4126
02:35:26.735 --> 02:35:30.314
including our emojis by ArseQueef.

4127
02:35:30.314 --> 02:35:33.727
And so ends another inexplicable journey,

4128
02:35:33.727 --> 02:35:38.727
a twisted car ride shrouded in fog with your high beams on.

4129
02:35:39.117 --> 02:35:41.367
A complicated parody promo.

4130
02:35:43.181 --> 02:35:45.598

4132
02:35:56.245 --> 02:35:59.028
You need to subscribe.

4134
02:36:04.023 --> 02:36:06.056
Gift subscribe.

4135
02:36:08.086 --> 02:36:12.336
Subscribe.

4136
02:36:15.417 --> 02:36:18.167
(dramatic music)

4137
02:49:17.698 --> 02:49:19.053
MATT: And welcome back.

4138
02:49:19.053 --> 02:49:20.507
Aww, almost.

4139
02:49:20.507 --> 02:49:21.340
Almost.

4140
02:49:23.224 --> 02:49:26.349
So we have our winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway.

4141
02:49:26.349 --> 02:49:29.810
The winner is Moonsstorm, with two S's,

4142
02:49:29.810 --> 02:49:32.115
Moonsstorm, congratulations.

4143
02:49:32.115 --> 02:49:36.374
We'll get you your victory Wyrmwood dice tray ASAP.

4144
02:49:36.374 --> 02:49:41.060
Now, in the interim, Mighty Nein,

4145
02:49:41.060 --> 02:49:43.951
you come to consciousness within the cavern

4146
02:49:43.951 --> 02:49:48.525
after a long rest within the eight hours

4147
02:49:48.525 --> 02:49:49.711
that you've rested,

4148
02:49:49.711 --> 02:49:52.555
which was not long after the sun set.

4149
02:49:52.555 --> 02:49:53.780
It is still dark.

4150
02:49:53.780 --> 02:49:54.702
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

4151
02:49:54.702 --> 02:49:57.147
MATT: The sun hasn't quite risen yet

4152
02:49:57.147 --> 02:50:00.987
when you come to your point of full rest.

4153
02:50:00.987 --> 02:50:04.216
The dome fades, because it only lasts for eight hours,

4154
02:50:04.216 --> 02:50:08.176
so it lasts for the length of the long rest.

4155
02:50:08.176 --> 02:50:11.836
The chill creeps in in the darkened shadow

4156
02:50:11.836 --> 02:50:14.728
lightless interior of the cavern.

4157
02:50:14.728 --> 02:50:15.652
What would you like to do?
LAURA: Oh, no,

4158
02:50:15.652 --> 02:50:17.027
we're outside of the cavern.

4159
02:50:17.027 --> 02:50:18.350
MATT: That's right, on the outskirts.

4160
02:50:18.350 --> 02:50:19.862
TRAVIS: Even colder.

4161
02:50:19.862 --> 02:50:21.225
MATT: Much colder now.

4162
02:50:22.525 --> 02:50:24.142
MICA: So first I Produce Flame so everybody

4163
02:50:24.142 --> 02:50:26.456
can huddle around it.

4164
02:50:26.456 --> 02:50:28.577
LAURA: People can see it though, it's dark, it's dark!

4165
02:50:28.577 --> 02:50:29.528
MICA: Oh, sh-- just kidding.

4166
02:50:29.528 --> 02:50:32.457
LAURA: (pigeon cooing)

4167
02:50:32.457 --> 02:50:36.199
I pull out the rod and just pass the Rod of Warmth around

4168
02:50:36.199 --> 02:50:37.353
from person to person.

4169
02:50:37.353 --> 02:50:39.192
TRAVIS: Grab the rod, all hands on the rad.

4170
02:50:39.192 --> 02:50:42.636
MATT: Warm, warm, pass, warm, warm, all right.

4171
02:50:42.636 --> 02:50:47.114
All of you desperately clinging to a semblance of body heat.

4172
02:50:47.114 --> 02:50:48.758
Thankfully, like you said, you brought some furs with you

4173
02:50:48.758 --> 02:50:49.678
and prepared yourself for the journey,

4174
02:50:49.678 --> 02:50:52.201
but it's still fucking cold.

4175
02:50:52.201 --> 02:50:53.039
MICA: Question.
MATT: Yes.

4176
02:50:53.039 --> 02:50:55.843
MICA: Was the tripwire alert spell still up?

4177
02:50:55.843 --> 02:50:56.932
Do we know if yetis--

4178
02:50:56.932 --> 02:50:59.585
MATT: It did not trip in the evening's, so.

4179
02:51:01.493 --> 02:51:05.788
MARISHA: All right, are we doing this yeti costume idea?

4180
02:51:05.788 --> 02:51:06.809
TRAVIS: No.

4181
02:51:06.809 --> 02:51:08.929
MICA: Can I send in more bats first

4182
02:51:08.929 --> 02:51:11.846
to see if there's a dragon, please?

4183
02:51:12.826 --> 02:51:13.853
Pretty please?

4184
02:51:13.853 --> 02:51:16.513
SAM: Let's get a little further in first.

4185
02:51:16.513 --> 02:51:17.688
TRAVIS: It's occurred to me that since

4186
02:51:17.688 --> 02:51:18.829
they didn't come in the night,

4187
02:51:18.829 --> 02:51:23.740
those missing yeti are probably the dragon's dinner.

4188
02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:24.926
LAURA: Did you just fart?

4189
02:51:24.926 --> 02:51:26.513
TRAVIS: No--
SAM: It sounded like it.

4190
02:51:26.513 --> 02:51:28.385
TRAVIS: It's the chair.
MARISHA: It's all right, Fjord.

4191
02:51:28.385 --> 02:51:29.835
SAM: You can try and do it again, but it's doing it.

4192
02:51:29.835 --> 02:51:33.792
TRAVIS: No, no, it's embarrassing, I wish it would.

4193
02:51:33.792 --> 02:51:36.217
It sounds like I farted.

4194
02:51:36.217 --> 02:51:39.010
SAM: Because it was a fart is why.

4195
02:51:39.010 --> 02:51:39.843
TRAVIS: Oh god.

4196
02:51:39.843 --> 02:51:41.517
(laughter)

4197
02:51:41.517 --> 02:51:44.403
MARISHA: We've been on Caduceus's mushroom diet, it's fine.

4198
02:51:44.403 --> 02:51:47.156
SAM: You can't recreate it because it was a legitimate fart.

4199
02:51:47.156 --> 02:51:47.989
TRAVIS: Shit.

4200
02:51:47.989 --> 02:51:48.866
(laughter)

4201
02:51:48.866 --> 02:51:51.556
I've got to fart before the end of this episode.

4202
02:51:51.556 --> 02:51:52.807
Chair fart, please.

4203
02:51:52.807 --> 02:51:56.597
MATT: <i>So</i> what would you guys like to do?

4204
02:51:56.597 --> 02:51:59.473
LAURA: We should sneak into the cave again.

4205
02:51:59.473 --> 02:52:04.473
(laughter)

4206
02:52:04.866 --> 02:52:06.288
MATT: Everyone roll stealth checks, please,

4207
02:52:06.288 --> 02:52:09.562
since you enter the cavern, in shadow.

4208
02:52:09.562 --> 02:52:11.604
LAURA: Should I Pass Without a Trace us?

4209
02:52:11.604 --> 02:52:15.121
MARISHA: What the fuck is wrong with me today?

4210
02:52:15.121 --> 02:52:16.295
TALIESIN: Hey!
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

4211
02:52:16.295 --> 02:52:17.300
MATT: Ooh, Beauregard?

4212
02:52:17.300 --> 02:52:18.583
MARISHA: One for Beauregard--

4213
02:52:18.583 --> 02:52:19.849
MATT: All right, those cancel each other out.

4214
02:52:19.849 --> 02:52:21.290
MARISHA: And 18.
SAM: 31.

4215
02:52:21.290 --> 02:52:22.452
MATT: 31, 18.

4216
02:52:22.452 --> 02:52:24.010
LAURA: 10.
MICA: 11.

4217
02:52:24.010 --> 02:52:26.052
TALIESIN: Natural 20.
MATT: Okay.

4218
02:52:27.220 --> 02:52:29.656
That came in clutch, okay.

4219
02:52:29.656 --> 02:52:31.959
You guys quietly enter the cavern,

4220
02:52:31.959 --> 02:52:36.042
the distant, faint element of early morning sunrise blue

4221
02:52:36.042 --> 02:52:40.218
beginning to crest on the horizon towards the east.

4222
02:52:40.218 --> 02:52:44.662
You make your way into the shadowed yeti cavern.

4223
02:52:44.662 --> 02:52:46.345
MARISHA: (laughing) Still trying.

4224
02:52:47.622 --> 02:52:48.999
SAM: He can't do it.
MARISHA: He can't.

4225
02:52:48.999 --> 02:52:50.523
He can't let it rest.

4226
02:52:50.523 --> 02:52:52.304
MATT: Passing within the shadow.

4227
02:52:52.304 --> 02:52:53.439
Sorry, I didn't mean to use the word passing,

4228
02:52:53.439 --> 02:52:54.699
I know it's a sensitive word.

4229
02:52:54.699 --> 02:52:56.935
(laughter)

4230
02:52:56.935 --> 02:52:58.970
It looks like they have not returned,

4231
02:52:58.970 --> 02:53:01.709
wherever these yeti may have been.

4232
02:53:01.709 --> 02:53:05.132
There is the larger, further end of the cavern to explore,

4233
02:53:05.132 --> 02:53:06.127
what would you guys like to do?

4234
02:53:06.127 --> 02:53:09.614
SAM: All right, one more recap of the plan.

4235
02:53:09.614 --> 02:53:11.068
You turn in to a wooly mammoth.

4236
02:53:11.068 --> 02:53:11.901
LAURA: Yes.

4237
02:53:11.901 --> 02:53:14.506
SAM: You're holding the mithral in your somewhere.

4238
02:53:14.506 --> 02:53:16.292
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to hold it in my trunk.

4239
02:53:16.292 --> 02:53:18.122
SAM: Oh wait, no, no, no, what am I saying?

4240
02:53:18.122 --> 02:53:19.730
No no, you're doing a queen spider.

4241
02:53:19.730 --> 02:53:20.593
MICA: Or a spider.

4242
02:53:20.593 --> 02:53:22.077
SAM: Yeah, you're going to be a queen ice spider,

4243
02:53:22.077 --> 02:53:23.437
and you're going to have the mithral.

4244
02:53:23.437 --> 02:53:25.200
MICA: No!
LAURA: She's summoning an ice spider.

4245
02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:26.817
MICA: I'm summoning a spider, and we're putting it

4246
02:53:26.817 --> 02:53:29.173
around the spider's neck, and then it goes in.

4247
02:53:29.173 --> 02:53:30.472
SAM: Okay, great.
MICA: Okay.

4248
02:53:30.472 --> 02:53:31.987
SAM: But it's just going to walk in,

4249
02:53:31.987 --> 02:53:33.489
we need someone to present it.

4250
02:53:33.489 --> 02:53:35.730
MICA: That's where the mammoth comes, or the yeti.

4251
02:53:35.730 --> 02:53:37.644
SAM: We don't have it yet.

4252
02:53:37.644 --> 02:53:39.381
LAURA: We're not going to do the yeti costume.

4253
02:53:39.381 --> 02:53:41.787
SAM: I think we need to do the yeti costume.

4254
02:53:41.787 --> 02:53:43.552
Unless you want to do Disguise Self

4255
02:53:43.552 --> 02:53:46.015
and be the smallest yeti history.

4256
02:53:46.015 --> 02:53:48.048
TRAVIS: I can't do that.
SAM: Oh.

4257
02:53:48.048 --> 02:53:49.566
LAURA: I can!
SAM: I can.

4258
02:53:49.566 --> 02:53:51.688
We'll be very small yetis.

4259
02:53:51.688 --> 02:53:53.959
TALIESIN: Can dragons see through illusions, though?

4260
02:53:53.959 --> 02:53:55.115
SAM: Should I sit on your shoulder?

4261
02:53:55.115 --> 02:53:57.696
LAURA: Then we could disguise ourselves as like--

4262
02:53:57.696 --> 02:53:59.050
SAM: I could be the top half.

4263
02:53:59.050 --> 02:54:01.147
LAURA: And I'll be the bottom half of the yeti?

4264
02:54:01.147 --> 02:54:02.780
Let's do it.
TRAVIS: Who knows dragons really well?

4265
02:54:02.780 --> 02:54:04.524
MARISHA: Would I have read if dragons can see through

4266
02:54:04.524 --> 02:54:08.757
illusions or bad body puppets?

4267
02:54:10.185 --> 02:54:13.396
MATT: They don't specifically refer to those topics,

4268
02:54:13.396 --> 02:54:15.712
usually that's involved in the cognitive capabilities

4269
02:54:15.712 --> 02:54:17.323
of a dragon.

4270
02:54:17.323 --> 02:54:19.996
Take that as you will.
TRAVIS: Normal people will normally see--

4271
02:54:19.996 --> 02:54:21.347
MARISHA: That it's a kigurumi?

4272
02:54:21.347 --> 02:54:22.248
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4273
02:54:22.248 --> 02:54:25.095
LAURA: No no no, me and Nott are going to disguise ourselves

4274
02:54:25.095 --> 02:54:28.316
as a bottom half of a yeti and the top half of a yeti.

4275
02:54:28.316 --> 02:54:29.457
MARISHA: Oh wait, you're combining--

4276
02:54:29.457 --> 02:54:32.230
MATT: Your disguises have to still be humanoid in form.

4277
02:54:32.230 --> 02:54:34.850
You can't be half a humanoid with Disguise Self.

4278
02:54:34.850 --> 02:54:38.251
SAM: Which is why we need a yeti skin--

4279
02:54:38.251 --> 02:54:39.301
TALIESIN: They are all gone.
SAM: -- to wear.

4280
02:54:39.301 --> 02:54:41.483
What do you mean they're gone?
TALIESIN: We set them all on fire.

4281
02:54:41.483 --> 02:54:42.895
MICA: No, we didn't,
LAURA: I buried them.

4282
02:54:42.895 --> 02:54:43.749
MATT: You didn't burn them all, you buried them.

4283
02:54:43.749 --> 02:54:44.840
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, we buried them.

4284
02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:46.598
MATT: The discussion was that the fire would take too long

4285
02:54:46.598 --> 02:54:48.273
to dispose of the bodies.
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4286
02:54:48.273 --> 02:54:50.882
LAURA: But they're probably rather frozen right now.

4287
02:54:50.882 --> 02:54:52.094
They'd be hard to open up.

4288
02:54:52.094 --> 02:54:53.413
MICA: I could warm them up.

4289
02:54:53.413 --> 02:54:56.306
TALIESIN: Do you know how to make a yeti costume?

4290
02:54:56.306 --> 02:54:59.034
TRAVIS: You know there is an option of just offering food

4291
02:54:59.034 --> 02:55:02.795
and paying this dragon handsomely in treasure.

4292
02:55:02.795 --> 02:55:04.753
MARISHA: I mean, I spent a lot of money

4293
02:55:04.753 --> 02:55:06.111
on a teleportation--
LAURA: That's what I was saying,

4294
02:55:06.111 --> 02:55:06.944
I could send a message

4295
02:55:06.944 --> 02:55:10.418
to the dragon and see if they would just do it.

4296
02:55:11.602 --> 02:55:14.516
Why is, I can do that and see.

4297
02:55:14.516 --> 02:55:18.109
SAM: And if they say no, then we're fjucked.

4298
02:55:18.109 --> 02:55:20.424
LAURA: What if I pretend like I'm really far way

4299
02:55:20.424 --> 02:55:24.877
and I'll be like: I'm across the planet from you,

4300
02:55:24.877 --> 02:55:27.390
but I heard of how amazing you are.

4301
02:55:27.390 --> 02:55:29.966
Can you breathe on some mithral for me?

4302
02:55:29.966 --> 02:55:31.909
I'll give you shit.

4303
02:55:31.909 --> 02:55:32.800
TRAVIS: Do it.
I think that's

4304
02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:35.624
under 25 words, what I just said.

4305
02:55:35.624 --> 02:55:37.982
TRAVIS: I'm ready, let's go.

4306
02:55:37.982 --> 02:55:41.214
SAM: I don't think this is--
MICA: What's the worst it could say, no?

4307
02:55:41.214 --> 02:55:42.047
SAM: Yes.

4308
02:55:42.047 --> 02:55:43.530
MICA: And then that's it.

4309
02:55:43.530 --> 02:55:46.712
Then we go with plan B, which is yeti puppets.

4310
02:55:46.712 --> 02:55:49.400
SAM: No no no no, once you send a message saying,

4311
02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:54.057
"Hey, brace yourself for some mithral and money soon,"

4312
02:55:54.057 --> 02:55:56.604
and then half of a yeti walks in

4313
02:55:56.604 --> 02:55:58.937
five minutes later holding--

4314
02:56:00.018 --> 02:56:03.685
MATT: To help cut through some of the confusion,

4315
02:56:04.541 --> 02:56:07.090
Message does require you to be familiar with the creature.

4316
02:56:07.090 --> 02:56:11.651
LAURA: I am, it's his name is Nightmare in Ivory.

4317
02:56:11.651 --> 02:56:13.659
MATT: You are aware of it.
LAURA: It's like a dragon.

4318
02:56:13.659 --> 02:56:16.770
MATT: I don't know if I would be considering this familiar.

4319
02:56:16.770 --> 02:56:18.896
LAURA: Aw, man.

4320
02:56:18.896 --> 02:56:22.187
MICA: Question, if my bats echolocate around the dragon

4321
02:56:22.187 --> 02:56:26.312
and then I describe it, would that then be familiar?

4322
02:56:26.312 --> 02:56:28.920
MATT: For the bats.
MICA: Shit.

4323
02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:32.728
LAURA: Let's just send in an ice spider queen

4324
02:56:32.728 --> 02:56:36.691
with some mithral around, and then you know what?

4325
02:56:36.691 --> 02:56:38.837
We can make ourselves look like a yeti,

4326
02:56:38.837 --> 02:56:40.966
but we'll stay far away and we'll just

4327
02:56:40.966 --> 02:56:44.627
wave in like the shadow and be like, There's some shit!

4328
02:56:44.627 --> 02:56:47.986
SAM: If I stood far enough away, I'd look like,

4329
02:56:47.986 --> 02:56:52.563
I'm a big regular-sized yeti, we're just far, far away.

4330
02:56:52.563 --> 02:56:53.572
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

4331
02:56:53.572 --> 02:56:55.201
TRAVIS: Are we sending the bats in first

4332
02:56:55.201 --> 02:56:56.725
to do a little recon or no?

4333
02:56:56.725 --> 02:56:58.128
MICA: I can do that.

4334
02:56:58.128 --> 02:57:02.312
MARISHA: (as Caleb) I can also always send in my shitty cat,

4335
02:57:02.312 --> 02:57:06.620
Frumpkin, that fucking fails at everything.

4336
02:57:07.571 --> 02:57:09.484
SAM: Caleb, that's your cat!

4337
02:57:09.484 --> 02:57:13.177
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, I love him so much.
TRAVIS: The bats are a bit more

4338
02:57:13.177 --> 02:57:15.643
potentially native to this area,

4339
02:57:15.643 --> 02:57:17.817
aside from an orange, tawny cat.
MICA: Also they can see in the dark

4340
02:57:17.817 --> 02:57:18.861
and the cat cannot.

4341
02:57:18.861 --> 02:57:20.462
LAURA: That's true.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4342
02:57:20.462 --> 02:57:22.216
So maybe we send--
MARISHA: Fucking.

4343
02:57:22.216 --> 02:57:24.468
(laughter)

4344
02:57:24.468 --> 02:57:27.884
MATT: Aggressively un-summon your familiar.

4345
02:57:27.884 --> 02:57:32.216
MICA: She just throws Frumpkin and it disappears.

4346
02:57:32.216 --> 02:57:35.143
MATT: Doesn't do well on YouTube these days.

4347
02:57:35.143 --> 02:57:36.951
SAM: Go ahead and send in the bats,

4348
02:57:36.951 --> 02:57:38.851
but I'm going to still push

4349
02:57:38.851 --> 02:57:41.689
one more time for the yeti costume.

4350
02:57:41.689 --> 02:57:43.072
TRAVIS: I'm not saying no anymore.

4351
02:57:43.072 --> 02:57:44.985
MICA: The yeti costume can come after the bats.

4352
02:57:44.985 --> 02:57:46.369
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, send in the bats.

4353
02:57:46.369 --> 02:57:48.017
MICA: Okay, on that note.

4354
02:57:48.017 --> 02:57:49.862
MARISHA and TALIESIN: ♪ Send in the bats ♪

4355
02:57:49.862 --> 02:57:50.695
(laughter)

4356
02:57:50.695 --> 02:57:52.776
MATT: You resummon and send in a cluster of bats?

4357
02:57:52.776 --> 02:57:55.450
MICA: Yes, I resummon, I Conjure Woodland Beings,

4358
02:57:55.450 --> 02:57:58.415
it's like a huge cluster, I tell them the same spiel.

4359
02:57:58.415 --> 02:58:01.148
Make their way deeper into the cavern.

4360
02:58:01.148 --> 02:58:04.565
They head their way through the 25-foot wide entrance,

4361
02:58:04.565 --> 02:58:07.238
they follow the corkscrew spiral,

4362
02:58:07.238 --> 02:58:10.071
they disappear for a bit.

4363
02:58:13.063 --> 02:58:16.301
About 10 or so minutes they return.

4364
02:58:16.301 --> 02:58:18.092
TRAVIS: Shit.

4365
02:58:18.092 --> 02:58:21.314
MICA: Okay, I cast Speak With Animals.
TRAVIS: All of them?

4366
02:58:21.314 --> 02:58:23.188
MATT: All of them.
MICA: Okay.

4367
02:58:23.188 --> 02:58:25.498
MATT: They impart to you the information.

4368
02:58:25.498 --> 02:58:30.498
"The cave goes around, and there's a lot of ice,

4369
02:58:30.575 --> 02:58:34.379
"it's really cold, then it goes straight up,

4370
02:58:34.379 --> 02:58:37.871
"and then there's a tall bit, and then

4371
02:58:37.871 --> 02:58:39.923
"there's a little bit forward in again,

4372
02:58:39.923 --> 02:58:41.695
"and then there's a wall of ice."

4373
02:58:41.695 --> 02:58:42.968
MARISHA: Oh fuck.

4374
02:58:42.968 --> 02:58:44.646
MICA: Did you not see a dragon?

4375
02:58:44.646 --> 02:58:45.479
MATT: "No."

4376
02:58:46.949 --> 02:58:50.058
MICA: Oh, and how tall is far up?

4377
02:58:51.014 --> 02:58:53.536
Like how many flaps?

4378
02:58:53.536 --> 02:58:55.330
MATT: They all start quietly flapping

4379
02:58:55.330 --> 02:58:57.821
to themselves trying to count.

4380
02:58:59.118 --> 02:59:00.531
"A lot."

4381
02:59:00.531 --> 02:59:01.591
MICA: A lot of flaps.

4382
02:59:01.591 --> 02:59:03.751
Okay, thank you everyone.
MATT: They have an intelligence of two,

4383
02:59:03.751 --> 02:59:04.584
I don't know.

4384
02:59:04.584 --> 02:59:06.667
MICA: That's fine. I un-summon them.

4385
02:59:06.667 --> 02:59:08.184
TRAVIS: Barely talked to them.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4386
02:59:08.184 --> 02:59:11.678
MICA: So flag on the play.

4387
02:59:11.678 --> 02:59:14.502
There's a hallway, it goes around and around,

4388
02:59:14.502 --> 02:59:17.108
and then it goes straight up. The bats said it took

4389
02:59:17.108 --> 02:59:19.917
a lot of flaps-- not so sure how many--

4390
02:59:19.917 --> 02:59:23.305
and then there's a wall of ice, no dragon.

4391
02:59:23.305 --> 02:59:25.520
LAURA: I bet the dragon is behind the wall of ice.

4392
02:59:25.520 --> 02:59:27.198
TALIESIN: Of course.

4393
02:59:27.198 --> 02:59:29.816
MARISHA: That does further go towards our theory

4394
02:59:29.816 --> 02:59:32.407
that he got trapped here as a baby.

4395
02:59:32.407 --> 02:59:33.260
TRAVIS: Oh god.

4396
02:59:33.260 --> 02:59:36.464
SAM: Listen to this, no yeti can climb up a thing

4397
02:59:36.464 --> 02:59:38.384
and then bust through a wall of ice,

4398
02:59:38.384 --> 02:59:40.378
so if they're bringing these gifts,

4399
02:59:40.378 --> 02:59:41.963
they're probably setting it at the bottom

4400
02:59:41.963 --> 02:59:45.865
of the tunnel or the shaft.

4401
02:59:45.865 --> 02:59:49.205
LAURA: Or maybe there's a pulley system!

4402
02:59:49.205 --> 02:59:50.454
Maybe there's like a basket and--

4403
02:59:50.454 --> 02:59:51.287
SAM: No, there's no pulley system.

4404
02:59:51.287 --> 02:59:52.845
LAURA: I bet there is, I bet there's something

4405
02:59:52.845 --> 02:59:54.894
you can set something in and then pull it all the way

4406
02:59:54.894 --> 02:59:56.928
to the top and let it be up there.

4407
02:59:56.928 --> 02:59:57.845
SAM: Negative.

4408
02:59:59.236 --> 03:00:01.300
I'll bet you five gold.

4409
03:00:01.300 --> 03:00:03.344
LAURA: Then I think it doesn't matter,

4410
03:00:03.344 --> 03:00:05.746
we should still try to send in the ice spider

4411
03:00:05.746 --> 03:00:09.929
and have it get breathed on.
SAM: Of course, agreed.

4412
03:00:09.929 --> 03:00:11.281
LAURA: Let's just head up there.

4413
03:00:11.281 --> 03:00:12.611
SAM: The only question is: Do we need a yeti

4414
03:00:12.611 --> 03:00:13.868
to bring it and leave it?

4415
03:00:13.868 --> 03:00:15.927
LAURA: Ooh.

4416
03:00:15.927 --> 03:00:16.760
No.

4417
03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:18.212
SAM: Okay, that's fine.

4418
03:00:18.212 --> 03:00:20.210
MARISHA: I think as long as, wait,

4419
03:00:20.210 --> 03:00:22.429
can anyone cast Invisibility on me?

4420
03:00:22.429 --> 03:00:23.778
SAM: Yes, I can.
MARISHA: You can?

4421
03:00:23.778 --> 03:00:24.876
SAM: Yes, I can.

4422
03:00:24.876 --> 03:00:26.660
MARISHA: Can you do it to you, too?

4423
03:00:26.660 --> 03:00:28.794
SAM: Not at the same time, but that's okay.

4424
03:00:28.794 --> 03:00:30.176
MATT: You can if it's a higher level.

4425
03:00:30.176 --> 03:00:31.878
SAM: I don't think I have any higher levels.

4426
03:00:31.878 --> 03:00:33.782
MATT: A 3rd-level spell? You don't have 3rd-level yet?

4427
03:00:33.782 --> 03:00:35.787
Yeah, then no, so you can only do it to one.

4428
03:00:35.787 --> 03:00:38.461
MARISHA: Can I do that?

4429
03:00:38.461 --> 03:00:41.974
MATT: I don't think Caleb has access to it yet.

4430
03:00:41.974 --> 03:00:42.807
MARISHA: Nope.

4431
03:00:42.807 --> 03:00:45.945
TRAVIS: Who goes in the yeti outfit?

4432
03:00:45.945 --> 03:00:48.153
SAM: Caduceus for the body.

4433
03:00:49.012 --> 03:00:50.431
TRAVIS: Are you volunteering for this?

4434
03:00:50.431 --> 03:00:52.939
SAM: Me for the head, Jester for the arms.

4435
03:00:52.939 --> 03:00:53.772
TALIESIN: What?

4436
03:00:53.772 --> 03:00:56.701
TRAVIS: We're going to lose three of you to this idea?

4437
03:00:56.701 --> 03:00:57.805
SAM: Lose?

4438
03:00:57.805 --> 03:01:00.054
You can go in there, you're pretty dextrous.

4439
03:01:00.054 --> 03:01:03.824
TALIESIN: I don't really understand, well, you know what?

4440
03:01:03.824 --> 03:01:05.772
For the moment, I'm going to be on board with this

4441
03:01:05.772 --> 03:01:07.314
because I don't actually think it's going to get that far.

4442
03:01:07.314 --> 03:01:10.701
TRAVIS: Stop doing that, no, don't give in!

4443
03:01:10.701 --> 03:01:13.259
Reason, rationale!

4444
03:01:13.259 --> 03:01:15.579
TALIESIN: I'm not giving in, I'm simply going with the flow.

4445
03:01:15.579 --> 03:01:17.296
LAURA: Or maybe it'll be a baby yeti.

4446
03:01:17.296 --> 03:01:18.990
SAM: You know what, if we're leaving a present

4447
03:01:18.990 --> 03:01:20.986
at the bottom of the shaft, then it doesn't matter.

4448
03:01:20.986 --> 03:01:22.511
The dragon's not going to see us.

4449
03:01:22.511 --> 03:01:24.034
MICA: What if the dragon's never seen a yeti

4450
03:01:24.034 --> 03:01:25.467
and this whole point is moot?

4451
03:01:25.467 --> 03:01:27.462
SAM: We'll just bring the spider, leave it,

4452
03:01:27.462 --> 03:01:29.925
make some noise like arr, and we'll leave.

4453
03:01:29.925 --> 03:01:31.686
MICA: Jester's so good at yeti noises.

4454
03:01:31.686 --> 03:01:33.733
LAURA: I am, I'm really good at it.

4455
03:01:33.733 --> 03:01:35.270
TRAVIS: Has it changed since yesterday?

4456
03:01:35.270 --> 03:01:36.432
LAURA: I was being a baby yeti.

4457
03:01:36.432 --> 03:01:39.128
TRAVIS: Oh. What does a real yeti sound like?

4458
03:01:39.128 --> 03:01:43.558
LAURA: (growling) Roar!

4459
03:01:43.558 --> 03:01:45.199
(strangled growling)

4460
03:01:45.199 --> 03:01:48.690
That was the one dying from fire, though.

4461
03:01:48.690 --> 03:01:51.724
That was its death gurgles.

4462
03:01:51.724 --> 03:01:54.391
SAM: We can just make a loud sound.

4463
03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:57.839
TRAVIS: I am here for this plan.

4464
03:01:57.839 --> 03:02:00.575
SAM: All right.
MARISHA: Looser Caduceus.

4465
03:02:00.575 --> 03:02:02.492
LAURA: We should check for traps as we go up,

4466
03:02:02.492 --> 03:02:04.315
I bet the dragon has set a lot of traps

4467
03:02:04.315 --> 03:02:06.285
at the corkscrew and the thing.

4468
03:02:06.285 --> 03:02:08.425
TALIESIN: Figuring out my spells, but yeah, all right.

4469
03:02:08.425 --> 03:02:10.803
LAURA: Oh shit, good call.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4470
03:02:10.803 --> 03:02:13.101
SAM: ♪ I'm going to get my drink on. ♪

4471
03:02:13.101 --> 03:02:15.152
TALIESIN: That's why I'm staring at my thing right now.

4472
03:02:15.152 --> 03:02:18.599
MARISHA: So wait, you're pro-yeti costume

4473
03:02:18.599 --> 03:02:21.318
until the rest of the group isn't yeti costume?

4474
03:02:21.318 --> 03:02:22.809
TALIESIN: It's not that I'm pro yeti costume,

4475
03:02:22.809 --> 03:02:26.423
I'm just a deep believer in learning through failure.

4476
03:02:26.423 --> 03:02:27.653
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

4477
03:02:27.653 --> 03:02:29.311
TALIESIN: I figure this'll end when they figure out

4478
03:02:29.311 --> 03:02:30.578
they can't make a yeti costume,

4479
03:02:30.578 --> 03:02:32.556
because I've never seen any of these people sew before,

4480
03:02:32.556 --> 03:02:33.847
and I know I can sew a bit,

4481
03:02:33.847 --> 03:02:35.264
but I'm not going to--
LAURA: I'm not saying we have to sew,

4482
03:02:35.264 --> 03:02:39.200
I'm saying, Caduceus, we can cut one of the yetis up--

4483
03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:40.727
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

4484
03:02:40.727 --> 03:02:43.085
LAURA: All of its insides out, just skin it basically,

4485
03:02:43.085 --> 03:02:44.323
and then just wear--
TRAVIS: No.

4486
03:02:44.323 --> 03:02:46.287
TALIESIN: We've had to do some of this before,

4487
03:02:46.287 --> 03:02:48.838
it's just not that easy.
SAM: All right, forget about it.

4488
03:02:48.838 --> 03:02:49.779
Let's just go.

4489
03:02:49.779 --> 03:02:51.933
TALIESIN: All the parts are stuck together.

4490
03:02:51.933 --> 03:02:52.766
LAURA: Oh.

4491
03:02:53.715 --> 03:02:54.653
I didn't think about that.

4492
03:02:54.653 --> 03:02:57.412
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, it's not just like a pocket

4493
03:02:57.412 --> 03:02:58.728
with a zipper on the back.

4494
03:02:58.728 --> 03:03:00.329
(laughter)

4495
03:03:00.329 --> 03:03:02.169
MARISHA: On paper--
TALIESIN: Would that it were.

4496
03:03:02.169 --> 03:03:03.410
MARISHA: -- this is a great plan,

4497
03:03:03.410 --> 03:03:05.034
I just want to point it out.

4498
03:03:05.034 --> 03:03:08.387
(laughter)

4499
03:03:08.387 --> 03:03:10.315
TALIESIN: Trying to paint that picture in my head--

4500
03:03:10.315 --> 03:03:12.009
SAM: -- stealthily into the tunnel.

4501
03:03:12.009 --> 03:03:14.167
MICA: Am I summoning the spider?
SAM: Not until we get closer.

4502
03:03:14.167 --> 03:03:16.296
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, is the spider friendly or is it--

4503
03:03:16.296 --> 03:03:18.974
MICA: It's my spider, so it listens to me.

4504
03:03:18.974 --> 03:03:21.557
TALIESIN: How long is the spider alive?

4505
03:03:26.649 --> 03:03:27.718
MICA: Up to one hour.

4506
03:03:27.718 --> 03:03:29.516
TALIESIN: Well, we'll get a little further.

4507
03:03:29.516 --> 03:03:31.987
Could be good to have a spider friend.

4508
03:03:31.987 --> 03:03:33.486
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4509
03:03:33.486 --> 03:03:38.486
MARISHA: (as Caleb) I will cast Mage Armor on myself.

4510
03:03:38.772 --> 03:03:41.190
MATT: Okay, so Caleb gets Mage Armor.

4511
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:44.139
MARISHA: Minor stealthing.
MATT: Got it.

4512
03:03:44.139 --> 03:03:46.960
MATT: You guys all progressing further into the cavern?

4513
03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:47.941
TALIESIN: Sure.
SAM: Yes.

4514
03:03:47.941 --> 03:03:48.826
MATT: With a light source or not?

4515
03:03:48.826 --> 03:03:50.332
Because it is pitch black in this cave,

4516
03:03:50.332 --> 03:03:54.999
and currently, only three of you do not have darkvision.

4517
03:03:56.116 --> 03:03:59.655
LAURA: You could do the globules, they're pretty faint.

4518
03:03:59.655 --> 03:04:00.783
MARISHA: <i>Ja</i>.

4519
03:04:00.783 --> 03:04:02.533
Do we want the light?

4520
03:04:03.583 --> 03:04:05.479
SAM and MARISHA: Jah.

4521
03:04:05.479 --> 03:04:07.318
LAURA: Should I have Sending today, do you think

4522
03:04:07.318 --> 03:04:10.499
we're going to need it?

4523
03:04:10.499 --> 03:04:12.878
SAM: Maybe if we need Essek.

4524
03:04:12.878 --> 03:04:16.786
LAURA: We won't though, we have, oh, if Caleb dies, though.

4525
03:04:16.786 --> 03:04:17.827
SAM: Caleb's not going to die,

4526
03:04:17.827 --> 03:04:19.301
we're not going to let Caleb die.

4527
03:04:19.301 --> 03:04:21.677
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to not have it.

4528
03:04:21.677 --> 03:04:25.259
TRAVIS: Wait, did we cast the dome to run back into?

4529
03:04:25.259 --> 03:04:26.874
SAM: When we get closer, possibly?

4530
03:04:26.874 --> 03:04:28.293
LAURA: Yeah, when we get closer.

4531
03:04:28.293 --> 03:04:32.067
TRAVIS: If we manage to get closer.

4532
03:04:32.067 --> 03:04:33.173
(laughter)

4533
03:04:33.173 --> 03:04:34.916
MATT: I like the way you think.

4534
03:04:34.916 --> 03:04:36.828
MICA: Oh.
MATT: No.

4535
03:04:36.828 --> 03:04:39.892
All right, so are you summoning the globes of light?

4536
03:04:39.892 --> 03:04:42.317
MARISHA: Foomph, foomph, foomph.
MATT: All right.

4537
03:04:42.317 --> 03:04:44.795
Traveling with you, ahead of you, what's the plan?

4538
03:04:44.795 --> 03:04:46.076
MARISHA: Who's up front?

4539
03:04:46.076 --> 03:04:47.468
SAM: How about some darkvisions up front

4540
03:04:47.468 --> 03:04:49.559
and the globules can be just behind.

4541
03:04:49.559 --> 03:04:51.460
TALIESIN: In the back, with the blind people.

4542
03:04:51.460 --> 03:04:53.908
MATT: Okay, so marching order is--
SAM: I'll go first.

4543
03:04:53.908 --> 03:04:55.159
MARISHA: I'll go behind Nott.

4544
03:04:55.159 --> 03:04:57.133
LAURA: I'll go behind Beau.

4545
03:04:57.133 --> 03:04:59.522
MICA: I can go behind Jester.

4546
03:04:59.522 --> 03:05:02.197
MATT: All right, Jester.
LAURA: Takes a minute.

4547
03:05:04.378 --> 03:05:06.240
Then we have Caleb, Fjord, and Caduceus.

4548
03:05:06.240 --> 03:05:08.556
TALIESIN: I'll take the back and I'll just keep an eye on--

4549
03:05:08.556 --> 03:05:09.922
MARISHA: Oh, leave it, perfectly,

4550
03:05:09.922 --> 03:05:11.397
they're ordered from height.

4551
03:05:11.397 --> 03:05:14.770
MICA: Oh!
MARISHA: It's amazing.

4552
03:05:14.770 --> 03:05:15.708
MATT: That's pretty great.

4553
03:05:15.708 --> 03:05:17.258
TALIESIN: So I can keep an eye on the back,

4554
03:05:17.258 --> 03:05:19.421
I'll be focusing where the blind is.

4555
03:05:19.421 --> 03:05:20.570
MATT: All right.

4556
03:05:20.570 --> 03:05:22.986
SAM: Can do, like, Fluffernutter and it gets hit with it.

4557
03:05:22.986 --> 03:05:25.160
If we need [inaudible] on the way out.

4558
03:05:25.160 --> 03:05:26.142
TALIESIN: Perfect.

4559
03:05:26.142 --> 03:05:28.455
MICA: Oh, scary cave music.

4560
03:05:28.455 --> 03:05:30.246
MATT: Oh, it's fine.

4561
03:05:30.246 --> 03:05:31.481
TALIESIN: He does this.

4562
03:05:31.481 --> 03:05:34.258
TRAVIS: Could be chanting, meditative cave music.

4563
03:05:34.258 --> 03:05:37.657
MATT: So you guys begin to enter,

4564
03:05:37.657 --> 03:05:42.422
slowly making your way into this extended tunnel

4565
03:05:42.422 --> 03:05:43.828
towards the back.

4566
03:05:43.828 --> 03:05:47.547
You're at the front there, Nott, what are you doing?

4567
03:05:47.547 --> 03:05:50.479
SAM: I'm going to take a big swig.

4568
03:05:50.479 --> 03:05:51.693
MATT: Okay.

4569
03:05:51.693 --> 03:05:53.793
SAM: And slowly proceed ahead,

4570
03:05:53.793 --> 03:05:55.477
just checking for traps as I go.

4571
03:05:55.477 --> 03:05:56.810
MATT: Okay.

4572
03:05:58.335 --> 03:06:00.042
You continue forward.

4573
03:06:00.042 --> 03:06:03.839
The temperature is increasingly colder

4574
03:06:03.839 --> 03:06:06.124
as you begin to step a few feet into this cavern,

4575
03:06:06.124 --> 03:06:09.711
you can see your breath is extremely visible,

4576
03:06:09.711 --> 03:06:11.741
and as you're quietly making your way through,

4577
03:06:11.741 --> 03:06:16.031
you hear this faint tinking sound around you

4578
03:06:16.031 --> 03:06:17.965
that you begin to realize is the sound of

4579
03:06:17.965 --> 03:06:21.513
the faint bit of moisture in your breath freezing

4580
03:06:21.513 --> 03:06:22.979
and then shattering on the ground.

4581
03:06:22.979 --> 03:06:24.822
SAM: It's cold.

4582
03:06:24.822 --> 03:06:27.980
MATT: Your noses and ears begin to go numb.

4583
03:06:27.980 --> 03:06:30.338
It is freezing cold.

4584
03:06:30.338 --> 03:06:32.938
Go ahead and make an investigation check.

4585
03:06:32.938 --> 03:06:34.378
SAM: Oh.

4586
03:06:34.378 --> 03:06:35.824
TRAVIS: I don't think we can touch the walls.

4587
03:06:35.824 --> 03:06:37.165
SAM: 14.

4588
03:06:37.165 --> 03:06:38.835
MATT: 14, okay.

4589
03:06:38.835 --> 03:06:40.778
Seems to be safe.

4590
03:06:40.778 --> 03:06:44.687
You continue on for about 30, 40 or so feet carefully.

4591
03:06:44.687 --> 03:06:48.489
Make another check as you progress forward.

4592
03:06:48.489 --> 03:06:50.511
SAM: Even worse, 13.

4593
03:06:50.511 --> 03:06:51.661
MATT: 13, no.

4594
03:06:51.661 --> 03:06:54.451
SAM: I'm getting scared, I'm going to take another swig.

4595
03:06:54.451 --> 03:06:55.511
MATT: Okay.

4596
03:06:55.511 --> 03:06:59.687
Continuing on, the tunnel begins to shift upward

4597
03:06:59.687 --> 03:07:01.999
and curve at the upper part of the spiral.

4598
03:07:01.999 --> 03:07:04.429
You move a little slower as you guys are having to,

4599
03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:06.829
in the slight incline, make sure you don't slip,

4600
03:07:06.829 --> 03:07:08.383
as it is relatively slick here.

4601
03:07:08.383 --> 03:07:10.611
The light, as it pushes through, you can see

4602
03:07:10.611 --> 03:07:13.309
it gleams across the ice surrounding you,

4603
03:07:13.309 --> 03:07:16.706
the little bit of modicum of light you carry.

4604
03:07:16.706 --> 03:07:18.482
Go ahead and try again.

4605
03:07:18.482 --> 03:07:19.733
SAM: (exhales)

4606
03:07:21.975 --> 03:07:23.359
17.

4607
03:07:23.359 --> 03:07:24.276
MATT: 17, okay.

4608
03:07:25.580 --> 03:07:27.593
You don't notice any traps.

4609
03:07:27.593 --> 03:07:29.711
Continue moving, you begin to see these

4610
03:07:29.711 --> 03:07:32.468
unique pillars, like stalagmites of ice

4611
03:07:32.468 --> 03:07:34.710
appearing in different areas

4612
03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:36.793
as you guys push through and continue forward

4613
03:07:36.793 --> 03:07:39.277
for another 30 or so feet.

4614
03:07:41.450 --> 03:07:42.846
What are you doing?
SAM: Roll again?

4615
03:07:42.846 --> 03:07:44.122
MATT: If you want to check again, yeah.

4616
03:07:44.122 --> 03:07:45.613
TRAVIS: (groaning)

4617
03:07:45.613 --> 03:07:47.700
(garbled panicking)

4618
03:07:47.700 --> 03:07:48.956
ALL: What?

4619
03:07:48.956 --> 03:07:50.238
(laughter)

4620
03:07:50.238 --> 03:07:52.210
TRAVIS: Mm!

4621
03:07:52.210 --> 03:07:54.570
Are they--
SAM: You can talk, Fjord.

4622
03:07:54.570 --> 03:07:58.453
TRAVIS: Yes, are there two on either side of the pathway

4623
03:07:58.453 --> 03:07:59.355
that we're walking down?

4624
03:07:59.355 --> 03:08:00.188
MTT: They're a little more scattered.

4625
03:08:00.188 --> 03:08:02.263
You see right now currently probably like four of them

4626
03:08:02.263 --> 03:08:03.477
with the light you have, and there's like

4627
03:08:03.477 --> 03:08:05.396
one immediately to your left, two

4628
03:08:05.396 --> 03:08:06.908
off to the right up there, and there's one

4629
03:08:06.908 --> 03:08:09.062
that's just out of range from the faint bit of light

4630
03:08:09.062 --> 03:08:10.102
that's given your darkvision.

4631
03:08:10.102 --> 03:08:11.410
TRAVIS: Are they all about the same size,

4632
03:08:11.410 --> 03:08:12.701
or different sizes?

4633
03:08:12.701 --> 03:08:15.159
MATT: Different sizes, but they're all about like,

4634
03:08:15.159 --> 03:08:17.854
six, seven feet in height.

4635
03:08:17.854 --> 03:08:20.082
TRAVIS: You should inspect them.

4636
03:08:20.082 --> 03:08:21.710
SAM: All right.

4637
03:08:21.710 --> 03:08:24.082
TRAVIS: I don't know if those are stalagmites.

4638
03:08:24.082 --> 03:08:28.582
MATT: Make a perception or investigation check, your call.

4639
03:08:30.689 --> 03:08:32.951
TRAVIS: I'll do it if you--
SAM: No no no, I'll do it.

4640
03:08:32.951 --> 03:08:35.071
I will take one more swig first.

4641
03:08:35.071 --> 03:08:35.928
MATT: Okay.

4642
03:08:35.928 --> 03:08:37.505
TRAVIS: Do you roll better when you're fucked up?

4643
03:08:37.505 --> 03:08:39.163
SAM: No, I roll worse.

4644
03:08:39.163 --> 03:08:40.364
MATT: You are now drunk.

4645
03:08:40.364 --> 03:08:41.197
SAM: Great.

4646
03:08:41.197 --> 03:08:44.145
LAURA: Why do you do this shit, Sam?

4647
03:08:44.145 --> 03:08:46.343
SAM: Okay, 14.

4648
03:08:46.343 --> 03:08:47.771
MATT: 14, okay.

4649
03:08:47.771 --> 03:08:49.475
You're looking for traps or you're inspecting the--

4650
03:08:49.475 --> 03:08:51.316
SAM: You said to look for what?

4651
03:08:51.316 --> 03:08:52.705
TRAVIS: Just inspect it.

4652
03:08:52.705 --> 03:08:53.693
SAM: Looking for traps.

4653
03:08:53.693 --> 03:08:55.296
LAURA: To see if it's actually a stalagmite or--

4654
03:08:55.296 --> 03:08:58.387
MATT: It's like smooth ice with a faint dust of snow.

4655
03:08:58.387 --> 03:09:01.556
You look over, it looks like a weird

4656
03:09:01.556 --> 03:09:02.656
stalagmite of ice, nothing else

4657
03:09:02.656 --> 03:09:03.789
catches your attention.
MARISHA: Do I see anything

4658
03:09:03.789 --> 03:09:06.901
that looks like it could be any type of mechanism?

4659
03:09:06.901 --> 03:09:09.014
MATT: Make a perception or investigation check.

4660
03:09:09.014 --> 03:09:10.930
TRAVIS: People that have been frozen in this hallway?

4661
03:09:10.930 --> 03:09:14.401
MARISHA: Or yeah, it's some-- goddamn it.

4662
03:09:14.401 --> 03:09:16.490
I'm supposed to be good at this shit.

4663
03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:17.657
11.

4664
03:09:17.657 --> 03:09:18.840
MATT: 11.

4665
03:09:18.840 --> 03:09:21.161
Nothing gets your attention.

4666
03:09:21.161 --> 03:09:21.994
Do you continue on?

4667
03:09:21.994 --> 03:09:23.535
SAM: Yeah, let's keep going.

4668
03:09:23.535 --> 03:09:25.303
TALIESIN: Do I see anything coming from behind?

4669
03:09:25.303 --> 03:09:26.886
MATT: Perception check.

4670
03:09:28.484 --> 03:09:29.318
TALIESIN: 27.

4671
03:09:29.318 --> 03:09:30.151
MATT: 27?

4672
03:09:30.151 --> 03:09:31.818
Nothing from behind.
TALIESIN: All right.

4673
03:09:33.519 --> 03:09:34.499
MATT: Okay.

4674
03:09:34.499 --> 03:09:35.748
You continue on.

4675
03:09:35.748 --> 03:09:37.757
You guys are just now stepping into,

4676
03:09:37.757 --> 03:09:40.292
you begin to see right at the end of the your darkvision

4677
03:09:40.292 --> 03:09:44.692
an end, like a slightly curved wall.

4678
03:09:44.692 --> 03:09:47.169
LAURA: What does the ceiling look like right now?

4679
03:09:47.169 --> 03:09:48.898
MATT: You glance up, and it looks like

4680
03:09:48.898 --> 03:09:52.459
a smooth ice tunnel, elements of it look

4681
03:09:52.459 --> 03:09:54.862
broken a bit and there are some very faint

4682
03:09:54.862 --> 03:09:57.218
icicle-like protrusions at the top of it,

4683
03:09:57.218 --> 03:09:58.581
but they're thin, they're like,

4684
03:09:58.581 --> 03:10:00.894
maybe a foot long, two feet long.

4685
03:10:00.894 --> 03:10:03.279
MICA: So we haven't reached the part where the bats said

4686
03:10:03.279 --> 03:10:05.810
it goes up yet, that's just in front of us?

4687
03:10:05.810 --> 03:10:07.503
MATT: Not yet.
MICA: Okay.

4688
03:10:07.503 --> 03:10:09.182
MATT: You do see an end to the tunnel.

4689
03:10:09.182 --> 03:10:11.466
SAM: Okay, I'll go all the way to the end,

4690
03:10:11.466 --> 03:10:14.498
and then going off what the bats said,

4691
03:10:14.498 --> 03:10:17.721
I'll just look all around, there's nothing else around here?

4692
03:10:17.721 --> 03:10:19.523
MATT: Looking straight up, indeed,

4693
03:10:19.523 --> 03:10:23.384
the tunnel shifts into an entire vertical path.

4694
03:10:23.384 --> 03:10:28.379
Same width, same space, it's about 25, 30 feet diameter,

4695
03:10:28.379 --> 03:10:30.589
like almost circular cavern.

4696
03:10:30.589 --> 03:10:32.905
But it shoots straight up at this point.

4697
03:10:32.905 --> 03:10:35.451
SAM: Are there any pulleys?

4698
03:10:35.451 --> 03:10:36.592
MATT: Make a perception check.

4699
03:10:36.592 --> 03:10:38.274
(laughter)

4700
03:10:39.591 --> 03:10:40.694
SAM: One.

4701
03:10:40.694 --> 03:10:43.999
MATT: No pulleys, and you don't see any other details.

4702
03:10:43.999 --> 03:10:45.161
Which is funny, because the rest of you can see

4703
03:10:45.161 --> 03:10:48.353
a lot of details around, just instinctually around Nott.

4704
03:10:48.353 --> 03:10:51.310
SAM: There's nothing here.
The bats were wrong.

4705
03:10:51.310 --> 03:10:53.235
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?
There's stuff everywhere.

4706
03:10:53.235 --> 03:10:55.567
MATT: You see a bunch of broken ice

4707
03:10:55.567 --> 03:10:59.206
just scattered across the ground here at the base.

4708
03:10:59.206 --> 03:11:02.699
Just broken, shattered chunks of different sizes of ice

4709
03:11:02.699 --> 03:11:04.570
that Nott pushes out of the way

4710
03:11:04.570 --> 03:11:07.035
and is like, I don't see anything.

4711
03:11:07.035 --> 03:11:10.407
LAURA: Does it look like the ice came from above?

4712
03:11:10.407 --> 03:11:12.848
MATT: It looks like it's not--

4713
03:11:14.106 --> 03:11:16.256
it's hard to tell, it's ice.

4714
03:11:16.256 --> 03:11:19.122
MICA: So if this is where the bats said it goes up

4715
03:11:19.122 --> 03:11:22.307
and there's a wall, should we just put the spider here,

4716
03:11:22.307 --> 03:11:25.433
back up, scream a bit and see what happens?

4717
03:11:25.433 --> 03:11:29.008
TRAVIS: Are we currently standing with the length above us?

4718
03:11:29.008 --> 03:11:30.125
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4719
03:11:30.125 --> 03:11:33.187
MATT: The vision of your darkvision is 60 feet, right?

4720
03:11:33.187 --> 03:11:37.715
Yeah, it continues up past the range of your darkvision.

4721
03:11:37.715 --> 03:11:39.178
TRAVIS: Just smooth surfaces of ice.

4722
03:11:39.178 --> 03:11:40.306
MATT: Smooth surfaces of ice.

4723
03:11:40.306 --> 03:11:44.176
MARISHA: We're literally fish in a barrel
if we stay down here.

4724
03:11:44.176 --> 03:11:46.899
MICA: So maybe we should back up.
TALIESIN: Who puts fish in a barrel?

4725
03:11:46.899 --> 03:11:51.135
TRAVIS: Or if we wanted to make a dome,
this might be a good spot.

4726
03:11:51.135 --> 03:11:53.572
TALIESIN: Oh, oh.
SAM: Yeah, should we dome it?

4727
03:11:53.572 --> 03:11:56.899
TALIESIN: Maybe not in this room.
MICA: No, back a bit.

4728
03:11:56.899 --> 03:11:59.200
TALIESIN: And then make a spider.

4729
03:11:59.200 --> 03:12:01.397
MICA: And then I can make a spider.

4730
03:12:01.397 --> 03:12:03.193
TRAVIS: What do you say, Caleb?

4731
03:12:03.193 --> 03:12:06.406
LAURA: But what if we put the spider down here

4732
03:12:06.406 --> 03:12:08.723
and the dragon doesn't come?

4733
03:12:08.723 --> 03:12:09.556
And then--

4734
03:12:09.556 --> 03:12:11.901
SAM: Can you make a spider a second time?

4735
03:12:11.901 --> 03:12:14.134
MICA: I can make a spider two more times.

4736
03:12:14.134 --> 03:12:15.472
SAM: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4737
03:12:15.472 --> 03:12:16.755
TALIESIN: We have an hour with the spider, too.

4738
03:12:16.755 --> 03:12:18.421
SAM: There's nothing else down here,

4739
03:12:18.421 --> 03:12:22.421
there's no ladders, no bones, there's no anything?

4740
03:12:22.421 --> 03:12:25.039
TRAVIS: Do we see any sort of equipment, weapons--?

4741
03:12:25.039 --> 03:12:26.753
MATT: You can make a perception or investigation check.

4742
03:12:26.753 --> 03:12:31.086
MARISHA: Also is there anything to like, climb up the wall?

4743
03:12:32.926 --> 03:12:33.859
TRAVIS: 18.

4744
03:12:33.859 --> 03:12:36.650
MATT: 18, the broken ice that's around the ground,

4745
03:12:36.650 --> 03:12:39.155
you begin to look down and see elements of it.

4746
03:12:39.155 --> 03:12:41.837
You see a hand in one of the pieces,

4747
03:12:41.837 --> 03:12:43.371
you see part of a head in another.

4748
03:12:43.371 --> 03:12:44.204
MICA: Oh!

4749
03:12:44.204 --> 03:12:45.092
TALIESIN: That's what I thought.

4750
03:12:45.092 --> 03:12:48.305
MATT: These are remnants of things that have been

4751
03:12:48.305 --> 03:12:51.894
sundered entirely, frozen and pulled apart.

4752
03:12:51.894 --> 03:12:55.287
Each chunk you see is but a part

4753
03:12:55.287 --> 03:12:59.814
where the majority of where the bodies would be is missing.

4754
03:12:59.814 --> 03:13:01.720
These are the scraps.

4755
03:13:01.720 --> 03:13:04.031
TALIESIN: Maybe this is where they leave the stuff.

4756
03:13:04.031 --> 03:13:05.978
So if we leave some stuff here,

4757
03:13:05.978 --> 03:13:08.894
we get into our little hiding place,

4758
03:13:08.894 --> 03:13:12.065
and then pull the metal out when it's time.

4759
03:13:12.065 --> 03:13:13.546
MICA: Hopefully the metal is still--

4760
03:13:13.546 --> 03:13:17.260
SAM: So you mean like, hide the metal among this ice stuff?

4761
03:13:17.260 --> 03:13:20.218
TALIESIN: We'll put the metal with the spider.

4762
03:13:20.218 --> 03:13:21.876
When it cooks the spider--

4763
03:13:21.876 --> 03:13:23.938
SAM: But like on the spider or under the spider?

4764
03:13:23.938 --> 03:13:26.760
MICA: Under the spider so it doesn't get (whooshes).

4765
03:13:26.760 --> 03:13:28.507
TALIESIN: Or maybe just hang it around

4766
03:13:28.507 --> 03:13:29.828
the spider's neck or something.

4767
03:13:29.828 --> 03:13:31.435
SAM: Well, this is my question. If we hang it around

4768
03:13:31.435 --> 03:13:33.066
the spider's neck, if the spider goes away,

4769
03:13:33.066 --> 03:13:34.004
the metal goes away.

4770
03:13:34.004 --> 03:13:35.438
TALIESIN: Well, it's going to cook it first.

4771
03:13:35.438 --> 03:13:37.281
SAM: I understand, but it still goes away.

4772
03:13:37.281 --> 03:13:40.537
So do we leave the metal on the ground

4773
03:13:40.537 --> 03:13:41.916
or put it on the spider?

4774
03:13:41.916 --> 03:13:43.337
TALIESIN: If it's on the spider, and the spider

4775
03:13:43.337 --> 03:13:45.391
and the metal get cooked, then we can Mage Hand

4776
03:13:45.391 --> 03:13:47.675
and as long as it's not like a tight cord,

4777
03:13:47.675 --> 03:13:49.484
just you know, or put in the spider's hand.

4778
03:13:49.484 --> 03:13:50.884
SAM: It'll be in a block of ice?

4779
03:13:50.884 --> 03:13:52.122
TALIESIN: It's not going to be in a block--

4780
03:13:52.122 --> 03:13:54.068
LAURA: It <i>will</i> be in a block of ice.

4781
03:13:54.068 --> 03:13:56.215
TRAVIS: It seems like he's been freezing these people

4782
03:13:56.215 --> 03:13:59.519
and then eating the ice and the person around it.

4783
03:13:59.519 --> 03:14:00.801
TALIESIN: Hmm.

4784
03:14:00.801 --> 03:14:02.750
TRAVIS: I mean, if a hand and a head and all these things

4785
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:05.184
are sticking out, the rest of the body was consumed.

4786
03:14:05.184 --> 03:14:07.034
MARISHA: What makes me nervous about just leaving it

4787
03:14:07.034 --> 03:14:09.389
on the ground though, is if the spider blocks

4788
03:14:09.389 --> 03:14:13.104
the path of the breath-- I mean, we could just try

4789
03:14:13.104 --> 03:14:16.608
and be on it and with it with Mage Hand

4790
03:14:16.608 --> 03:14:18.184
and make sure it's in the path.

4791
03:14:18.184 --> 03:14:20.448
MICA: Wouldn't it be impervious to being frozen

4792
03:14:20.448 --> 03:14:22.938
if the whole point is to get it frozen?

4793
03:14:22.938 --> 03:14:25.176
LAURA: Yeah, but it might be stuck to the spider.

4794
03:14:25.176 --> 03:14:27.083
MICA: Oh.

4795
03:14:27.083 --> 03:14:31.365
Not if it's on a rope, like a dangly rope.

4796
03:14:31.365 --> 03:14:33.634
LAURA: If we put it on the ground next to the spider,

4797
03:14:33.634 --> 03:14:38.005
I bet, you know-- this breath, it goes really far.

4798
03:14:38.005 --> 03:14:39.080
MARISHA: Fjord.
TRAVIS: Yep.

4799
03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:40.365
LAURA: It's got a cone sort of effect.

4800
03:14:40.365 --> 03:14:43.030
MICA: Can you turn it invisible just in casies?

4801
03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:45.866
But then would we know when it's done?

4802
03:14:45.866 --> 03:14:48.731
SAM: Also, I don't think we can turn it invisible.

4803
03:14:48.731 --> 03:14:52.527
MARISHA: Fjord, you're a sailor, you're good with knots,

4804
03:14:52.527 --> 03:14:57.368
isn't there some sort of like a cool rip-- what?

4805
03:14:57.368 --> 03:14:58.918
SAM: Dragon knot.

4806
03:14:58.918 --> 03:15:00.548
TRAVIS: That's not a thing.

4807
03:15:00.548 --> 03:15:02.722
MARISHA: Kind of a rip cord situation

4808
03:15:02.722 --> 03:15:05.889
where you can pull it and slip it off?

4809
03:15:07.076 --> 03:15:09.176
TRAVIS: Oh, like you can yank on the piece of rope

4810
03:15:09.176 --> 03:15:11.676
and release the knot?
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

4811
03:15:12.529 --> 03:15:15.137
TRAVIS: Gee, I don't think so.

4812
03:15:16.245 --> 03:15:17.939
Not with like a yank.

4813
03:15:17.939 --> 03:15:18.772
I mean, you could--

4814
03:15:18.772 --> 03:15:23.161
LAURA: What if we put the ingot on top of a shield,

4815
03:15:23.161 --> 03:15:25.094
and it's round, right, so it's like a sled,

4816
03:15:25.094 --> 03:15:27.136
and then we tie the rope to like a thing.

4817
03:15:27.136 --> 03:15:29.484
So like, when we go to pull,

4818
03:15:29.484 --> 03:15:32.636
we can just pull the shield and it pulls out faster.

4819
03:15:32.636 --> 03:15:34.143
SAM: I like it.
MICA: Hmm.

4820
03:15:34.143 --> 03:15:37.980
LAURA: We'll just sit it on the ground next to the spider.

4821
03:15:39.238 --> 03:15:40.630
MICA: Works for me.

4822
03:15:40.630 --> 03:15:43.112
LAURA: It looks like the spider maybe killed something,

4823
03:15:43.112 --> 03:15:45.220
you know, with a shield.

4824
03:15:45.220 --> 03:15:47.412
TRAVIS: Is there something just standing inside of the dome

4825
03:15:47.412 --> 03:15:50.586
and holding the ingot on the outside of it?

4826
03:15:52.477 --> 03:15:54.293
SAM: We could do that, too.

4827
03:15:54.293 --> 03:15:56.075
The dragon might think it's odd

4828
03:15:56.075 --> 03:15:57.957
that there's a gigantic 20-foot dome

4829
03:15:57.957 --> 03:15:59.655
right next to a weird spider.

4830
03:15:59.655 --> 03:16:01.215
TRAVIS: This dragon's stupid.

4831
03:16:01.215 --> 03:16:02.954
TALIESIN: Well--

4832
03:16:02.954 --> 03:16:04.520
TRAVIS: No, I'm kidding, it's a person.

4833
03:16:04.520 --> 03:16:06.530
A stupid person.

4834
03:16:06.530 --> 03:16:07.980
SAM: I say we hide it among the

4835
03:16:07.980 --> 03:16:09.643
shards of glass on the ground

4836
03:16:09.643 --> 03:16:11.347
and maybe tie something to it.

4837
03:16:11.347 --> 03:16:12.543
LAURA: Yeah.

4838
03:16:12.543 --> 03:16:14.118
TRAVIS: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah.

4839
03:16:14.118 --> 03:16:15.902
SAM: Do we have an extra shield?

4840
03:16:15.902 --> 03:16:17.173
LAURA: We have my shield.

4841
03:16:17.173 --> 03:16:18.999
TRAVIS: Or mine.

4842
03:16:18.999 --> 03:16:20.741
SAM: You need it.

4843
03:16:20.741 --> 03:16:22.349
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do.

4844
03:16:22.349 --> 03:16:24.574
(laughter)

4845
03:16:25.433 --> 03:16:29.344
SAM: Are there any shields lying it around on the ground?

4846
03:16:29.344 --> 03:16:31.527
TALIESIN: I could take one of the plates off of my old--

4847
03:16:31.527 --> 03:16:33.874
I mean, I have one of the beetle plates--

4848
03:16:33.874 --> 03:16:35.581
TRAVIS: We have a plain wooden shield.

4849
03:16:35.581 --> 03:16:37.487
SAM: Great, perfect.
TALIESIN: Oh, that'll do it.

4850
03:16:37.487 --> 03:16:38.725
LAURA: Hey.

4851
03:16:38.725 --> 03:16:40.415
MATT: All righty, so what's the plan?

4852
03:16:40.415 --> 03:16:42.687
LAURA: We're going to--
MARISHA: Yeah, what's the plan?

4853
03:16:42.687 --> 03:16:43.979
SAM: Put the ingot on the shield.

4854
03:16:43.979 --> 03:16:46.030
LAURA: Put the ingot on the shield, put the shield face down

4855
03:16:46.030 --> 03:16:47.619
so it's like slidey on the thing,

4856
03:16:47.619 --> 03:16:51.167
tie rope to the handle of the shield,

4857
03:16:51.167 --> 03:16:55.617
back way up, and keep that on like a thing ready to pull.

4858
03:16:55.617 --> 03:16:56.815
SAM: Who's going to pull?

4859
03:16:56.815 --> 03:16:57.800
LAURA: I'll pull.

4860
03:16:57.800 --> 03:16:58.887
I'm really strong.
SAM: Okay.

4861
03:16:58.887 --> 03:17:01.535
LAURA: And then we're going to send in the spider

4862
03:17:01.535 --> 03:17:06.166
to sit under the tunnel, and then we're going to yeti call.

4863
03:17:06.166 --> 03:17:07.695
SAM: Or just make a noise.

4864
03:17:07.695 --> 03:17:08.861
It doesn't have to be a yeti noise.

4865
03:17:08.861 --> 03:17:11.237
MICA: Do we still have the rock so we're
not making the noise,

4866
03:17:11.237 --> 03:17:13.005
so it doesn't come swooping down the hallway,

4867
03:17:13.005 --> 03:17:14.913
but it comes to the spider?

4868
03:17:14.913 --> 03:17:17.939
MATT: How much rope are you guys going to put on this thing?

4869
03:17:17.939 --> 03:17:19.411
TALIESIN: How much do we have?

4870
03:17:19.411 --> 03:17:20.739
TRAVIS: 50 feet from me.

4871
03:17:20.739 --> 03:17:21.910
MARISHA: I have 50 feet as well.

4872
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:23.606
LAURA: So 100 feet of rope.
MARISHA: 150 feet.

4873
03:17:23.606 --> 03:17:25.314
LAURA: 150 feet of rope.

4874
03:17:25.314 --> 03:17:28.280
MATT: Okay, so you can tie end to end and have 100--,

4875
03:17:28.280 --> 03:17:33.280
we'll say tied together, 145 feet of rope.

4876
03:17:34.026 --> 03:17:34.859
LAURA: Cool.

4877
03:17:34.859 --> 03:17:38.939
TALIESIN: How deep down is this head underneath the ice?

4878
03:17:38.939 --> 03:17:40.180
TRAVIS: Are you going to be able to pull

4879
03:17:40.180 --> 03:17:43.013
140 feet--
MATT: Oh, the one that's mostly eaten?

4880
03:17:43.013 --> 03:17:45.396
You see part of a forehead and an eye that's locked in

4881
03:17:45.396 --> 03:17:48.845
about-- there's like two inches of ice around it,

4882
03:17:48.845 --> 03:17:50.895
and it looks like it's--

4883
03:17:50.895 --> 03:17:52.636
TALIESIN: There's not a face.

4884
03:17:52.636 --> 03:17:54.252
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Okay.

4885
03:17:55.099 --> 03:17:56.507
I was hoping.

4886
03:17:58.122 --> 03:18:01.060
This is the perfect place to bring Speak With Dead.

4887
03:18:01.060 --> 03:18:02.259
You never know.

4888
03:18:02.259 --> 03:18:05.034
MATT: Yeah, that's true.

4889
03:18:05.034 --> 03:18:06.758
You have to find a more complete corpse, unfortunately.

4890
03:18:06.758 --> 03:18:08.047
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4891
03:18:08.047 --> 03:18:10.398
MICA: Some words you'd never thought you'd hear.

4892
03:18:10.398 --> 03:18:13.912
LAURA: I wonder how the yetis let the dragon know

4893
03:18:13.912 --> 03:18:15.950
that something's here.

4894
03:18:15.950 --> 03:18:18.298
SAM: Do you see anything around that they bang on?

4895
03:18:18.298 --> 03:18:21.881
LAURA: Yeah, can we see any sort of alarm system?

4896
03:18:21.881 --> 03:18:23.731
MATT: Make a perception check.

4897
03:18:25.072 --> 03:18:27.050
SAM: We have firecrackers.

4898
03:18:27.050 --> 03:18:28.963
MARISHA: You beat me to it.

4899
03:18:28.963 --> 03:18:30.374
LAURA: 23.

4900
03:18:30.374 --> 03:18:31.996
MATT: 23.

4901
03:18:31.996 --> 03:18:35.693
You don't see any tools or implements

4902
03:18:35.693 --> 03:18:38.143
that would be used to gather attention.

4903
03:18:38.143 --> 03:18:40.544
SAM: She's got firecrackers.

4904
03:18:40.544 --> 03:18:43.190
That'll do it, or we have the Thaumaturgy.

4905
03:18:43.190 --> 03:18:45.509
LAURA: Yeah, we can shout with Thaumaturgy up the tunnel.

4906
03:18:45.509 --> 03:18:47.231
TALIESIN: We can shake it a little bit--

4907
03:18:47.231 --> 03:18:48.438
LAURA: Make it sound like yetis.

4908
03:18:48.438 --> 03:18:50.543
TALIESIN: Some yeti noises, yeah.

4909
03:18:50.543 --> 03:18:52.066
Some kind.
SAM: Let's do it.

4910
03:18:52.066 --> 03:18:54.330
MATT: So you have the rope.
SAM: This is a good plan.

4911
03:18:54.330 --> 03:18:57.133
You're tying the rope to the ingot of mithral?

4912
03:18:57.133 --> 03:18:59.915
MARISHA: To the shield.
MATT: Oh, to the shield, okay.

4913
03:18:59.915 --> 03:19:01.274
With the mithral on top of it.

4914
03:19:01.274 --> 03:19:03.710
On top of the shield, and you're placing it where?

4915
03:19:03.710 --> 03:19:05.581
LAURA: Right next to the spider as we're going

4916
03:19:05.581 --> 03:19:07.153
like under the path.

4917
03:19:07.153 --> 03:19:10.531
MATT: Okay, so central to the bottom of the tunnel.

4918
03:19:10.531 --> 03:19:13.840
MARISHA: (as Caleb) I-- hang on, I have an idea.

4919
03:19:13.840 --> 03:19:17.016
And he takes out some of his gum.

4920
03:19:18.165 --> 03:19:19.196
TRAVIS: Chewing gum?

4921
03:19:19.196 --> 03:19:20.216
MATT: It's not chewing gum.

4922
03:19:20.216 --> 03:19:22.530
MARISHA: Well he's got like a Xanthan gum type of thing.

4923
03:19:22.530 --> 03:19:23.879
MATT: Okay.

4924
03:19:23.879 --> 03:19:25.978
MARISHA: He does this all the time.
MATT: All right.

4925
03:19:25.978 --> 03:19:28.494
MARISHA: He sticks it to the bottom,

4926
03:19:28.494 --> 03:19:31.667
and puts it on the-- sticks the ingot to the shield.

4927
03:19:31.667 --> 03:19:32.954
MATT: You got it.

4928
03:19:32.954 --> 03:19:35.188
MICA: My spider can also climb up the wall

4929
03:19:35.188 --> 03:19:36.547
and knock on the door.

4930
03:19:36.547 --> 03:19:38.573
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.
MICA: Should we have him do that?

4931
03:19:38.573 --> 03:19:40.399
TRAVIS: Is there a door?
MICA: Or her.

4932
03:19:40.399 --> 03:19:42.920
Well, on the the giant door of ice.

4933
03:19:42.920 --> 03:19:44.606
SAM: The ice wall.

4934
03:19:44.606 --> 03:19:48.693
MARISHA: Well, we want the spider to stay by the ingot.

4935
03:19:48.693 --> 03:19:50.509
MICA: It can knock and then crawl back down,

4936
03:19:50.509 --> 03:19:52.647
so we don't have to scream and put ourselves at risk.

4937
03:19:52.647 --> 03:19:54.458
LAURA: We can use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like

4938
03:19:54.458 --> 03:19:56.635
the yetis are calling.

4939
03:19:56.635 --> 03:19:58.500
MARISHA: All right.
MATT: Okay.

4940
03:19:58.500 --> 03:20:01.808
MARISHA: You want to cast Invisibility on me, just in case?

4941
03:20:01.808 --> 03:20:06.415
SAM: Are you going to be closer than 150 feet?

4942
03:20:06.415 --> 03:20:07.390
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: All right.

4943
03:20:07.390 --> 03:20:10.135
MICA: We need somebody nearby to see
if the ingot turns blue.

4944
03:20:10.135 --> 03:20:11.613
TRAVIS: I'll stay nearby.

4945
03:20:11.613 --> 03:20:14.618
ALL: No!
SAM: No, you will not.

4946
03:20:14.618 --> 03:20:18.222
You are a little cherub boy, you cannot be anywhere

4947
03:20:18.222 --> 03:20:19.950
near a fierce creature.

4948
03:20:19.950 --> 03:20:22.166
LAURA: I'm cold resistant.

4949
03:20:22.166 --> 03:20:23.476
Maybe I should stay.

4950
03:20:23.476 --> 03:20:25.561
MICA: If you want to stay inside a hut for yetis,

4951
03:20:25.561 --> 03:20:27.424
you should stay inside a hut for dragons.

4952
03:20:27.424 --> 03:20:28.493
SAM: Absolutely, it should be Jester.

4953
03:20:28.493 --> 03:20:31.775
She can Dimension Door away if it gets too close.

4954
03:20:31.775 --> 03:20:34.690
TRAVIS: All right, I just wanted to help.

4955
03:20:34.690 --> 03:20:36.668
MICA: You can help by being safe.

4956
03:20:36.668 --> 03:20:39.367
SAM: You're super strong, I saw you in that last fight

4957
03:20:39.367 --> 03:20:41.426
with the whip, why don't you pull the rope?

4958
03:20:41.426 --> 03:20:42.603
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

4959
03:20:42.603 --> 03:20:44.470
SAM: It's like a whip.

4960
03:20:44.470 --> 03:20:46.010
TRAVIS: All right.

4961
03:20:46.010 --> 03:20:48.673
MATT: Okay, so you're handling the rope

4962
03:20:48.673 --> 03:20:49.975
with the end of the length.

4963
03:20:49.975 --> 03:20:50.808
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

4964
03:20:50.808 --> 03:20:52.250
MATT: You guys have placed the shield in place.

4965
03:20:52.250 --> 03:20:55.480
SAM: Caduceus, Bless him, he can't pull a rope.

4966
03:20:55.480 --> 03:20:57.788
TALIESIN: Bless only lasts a minute.
SAM: That's all he'll need.

4967
03:20:57.788 --> 03:20:59.874
TALIESIN: I actually-- yeah, I might-- well--

4968
03:20:59.874 --> 03:21:02.342
MICA: I want to reach over, just pat him on the head.

4969
03:21:02.342 --> 03:21:03.558
MATT: Okay.

4970
03:21:03.558 --> 03:21:05.899
All right, is Caleb producing the--

4971
03:21:05.899 --> 03:21:07.428
SAM: Oh yes, Caleb going to make the--

4972
03:21:07.428 --> 03:21:10.318
MARISHA: He's making the hut.

4973
03:21:10.318 --> 03:21:12.430
MATT: 145 feet back?
MARISHA: Yeah.

4974
03:21:12.430 --> 03:21:14.893
MATT: Okay, that'll still put you inside like,

4975
03:21:14.893 --> 03:21:16.946
right towards the entrance of the cavern,

4976
03:21:16.946 --> 03:21:20.365
so you guys are near in between where the yeti

4977
03:21:20.365 --> 03:21:23.327
village area is, the entrance to the cavern,

4978
03:21:23.327 --> 03:21:24.397
you guys are right on that cusp.

4979
03:21:24.397 --> 03:21:25.872
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Okay.

4980
03:21:26.840 --> 03:21:27.971
MATT: Okay.

4981
03:21:27.971 --> 03:21:29.638
The dome is created.

4982
03:21:31.513 --> 03:21:33.963
SAM: I will cast Invisibility on Beauregard.

4983
03:21:33.963 --> 03:21:35.240
MATT: Beauregard is invisible.

4984
03:21:35.240 --> 03:21:36.415
LAURA: Okay.

4985
03:21:36.415 --> 03:21:40.040
But maybe I should be invisible, because
I'm going to be next to--

4986
03:21:40.040 --> 03:21:42.316
It's okay, I'll just be out there.

4987
03:21:42.316 --> 03:21:43.698
MARISHA: Yeah.

4988
03:21:43.698 --> 03:21:45.635
SAM: No, you should be invisible.

4989
03:21:45.635 --> 03:21:48.278
LAURA: I'm going to disguise myself as--

4990
03:21:48.278 --> 03:21:50.435
SAM: I will cast Invisibility on you.

4991
03:21:50.435 --> 03:21:52.614
SAM: Actually wait, Caleb can cast Invisibility.

4992
03:21:52.614 --> 03:21:54.921
MATT: I don't think he has the spell, does he?

4993
03:21:54.921 --> 03:21:56.607
You have to check his inventory.

4994
03:21:56.607 --> 03:21:57.440
He might.

4995
03:21:58.407 --> 03:22:00.235
He had a scroll once, but I think he used it as a scroll.

4996
03:22:00.235 --> 03:22:01.620
MARISHA: He used it as a scroll.
MATT: Yeah.

4997
03:22:01.620 --> 03:22:02.632
MARISHA: He doesn't have it.

4998
03:22:02.632 --> 03:22:05.149
LAURA: He didn't get to scribe it.

4999
03:22:05.149 --> 03:22:07.265
SAM: So should I do it to you?

5000
03:22:07.265 --> 03:22:09.542
Or do you want to disguise yourself or something?

5001
03:22:09.542 --> 03:22:10.375
LAURA: Or...

5002
03:22:12.099 --> 03:22:14.365
MARISHA: I just thought I could run real fast.

5003
03:22:14.365 --> 03:22:15.487
LAURA: Yeah.

5004
03:22:15.487 --> 03:22:16.368
MARISHA: That's all.

5005
03:22:16.368 --> 03:22:17.764
SAM: I can only do it to one person.

5006
03:22:17.764 --> 03:22:19.460
MARISHA: It's kind of what I got right now.

5007
03:22:19.460 --> 03:22:21.235
SAM: Who should I do it to?

5008
03:22:21.235 --> 03:22:22.632
LAURA: Are you cold resistant?

5009
03:22:22.632 --> 03:22:24.476
MARISHA: No, but I can run real fast.

5010
03:22:24.476 --> 03:22:26.707
LAURA: I can Dimension Door 500 feet.

5011
03:22:26.707 --> 03:22:27.639
TRAVIS: Are you saying you want to be invisible

5012
03:22:27.639 --> 03:22:28.481
or you don't?

5013
03:22:28.481 --> 03:22:32.869
MARISHA: No, I'm saying I can be invisible
and be a runner in case--

5014
03:22:32.869 --> 03:22:34.298
TRAVIS: All right, if you're cold resistant,

5015
03:22:34.298 --> 03:22:35.913
and you can get out quickly, then perhaps--

5016
03:22:35.913 --> 03:22:38.297
LAURA: All right, I'll just be me.

5017
03:22:38.297 --> 03:22:39.917
TRAVIS: Unless you wanted to disguise yourself?

5018
03:22:39.917 --> 03:22:43.834
LAURA: I'll hide behind one of those stalag...

5019
03:22:43.834 --> 03:22:45.800
mites on the ground.

5020
03:22:45.800 --> 03:22:48.357
MATT: Okay, so you go back and get behind one of those.

5021
03:22:48.357 --> 03:22:49.190
Totally.

5022
03:22:49.190 --> 03:22:53.690
The one that's closest, or-- it's about 60, 70 or so feet

5023
03:22:53.690 --> 03:22:56.055
away from the center of the cavern for that last one.

5024
03:22:56.055 --> 03:22:58.282
LAURA: Is it close enough so I can see if it's turning blue?

5025
03:22:58.282 --> 03:22:59.823
MATT: You have darkvision?
LAURA: Yeah.

5026
03:22:59.823 --> 03:23:02.582
MATT: It's on the cusp.
LAURA: Okay.

5027
03:23:04.831 --> 03:23:06.112
MARISHA: What are you doing?

5028
03:23:06.112 --> 03:23:09.353
SAM: I'm going to be up there with you.

5029
03:23:09.353 --> 03:23:10.775
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: You're not cold resistant.

5030
03:23:10.775 --> 03:23:13.332
SAM: No, I know, but I'm good at hiding.

5031
03:23:13.332 --> 03:23:14.790
LAURA: But what if you get breathed on?

5032
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:15.623
You could die.

5033
03:23:15.623 --> 03:23:17.159
SAM: You can Dimension Door me out.

5034
03:23:17.159 --> 03:23:18.486
LAURA: I'd have to get to you.

5035
03:23:18.486 --> 03:23:20.558
SAM: I'll be near you.

5036
03:23:20.558 --> 03:23:22.347
LAURA: Stay right next to me.

5037
03:23:22.347 --> 03:23:24.452
SAM: I always follow orders.

5038
03:23:24.452 --> 03:23:27.150
(laughter)

5039
03:23:27.150 --> 03:23:29.154
TALIESIN: Oh boy.
TRAVIS: God.

5040
03:23:29.154 --> 03:23:31.542
LAURA: This is going to shit really fast.

5041
03:23:31.542 --> 03:23:34.915
TRAVIS: I want to push pause and hit the save icon.

5042
03:23:34.915 --> 03:23:37.027
(laughter)

5043
03:23:37.027 --> 03:23:37.860
MATT: If only.

5044
03:23:37.860 --> 03:23:39.068
TRAVIS: Save point.
MICA: Save in an extra slot.

5045
03:23:39.068 --> 03:23:40.805
MATT: Some pieces are set.

5046
03:23:40.805 --> 03:23:43.603
What are the next things to do?

5047
03:23:43.603 --> 03:23:44.810
MICA: Shall I make my--

5048
03:23:44.810 --> 03:23:46.565
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5049
03:23:46.565 --> 03:23:47.398
MICA: Okay, so.

5050
03:23:47.398 --> 03:23:51.904
MARISHA: Caleb says: If anything goes wrong,

5051
03:23:51.904 --> 03:23:55.096
you send me a message.

5052
03:23:55.096 --> 03:23:55.985
Okay.

5053
03:23:55.985 --> 03:23:59.182
SAM: It won't get to you because you'll be in the dome.

5054
03:23:59.182 --> 03:24:00.252
LAURA: Yes, it--
TALIESIN: Yeah, it will.

5055
03:24:00.252 --> 03:24:02.760
TRAVIS: Nope, nothing goes through the dome.

5056
03:24:02.760 --> 03:24:04.257
(laughing)

5057
03:24:04.257 --> 03:24:05.793
But sound travels.

5058
03:24:05.793 --> 03:24:07.582
Sound travels.

5059
03:24:07.582 --> 03:24:09.690
MATT: You can hear outside of it, yeah.

5060
03:24:09.690 --> 03:24:12.519
MICA: If you scream like a little bitch.

5061
03:24:12.519 --> 03:24:14.641
TRAVIS: (shouting) Come fucking save me!

5062
03:24:14.641 --> 03:24:16.241
(laughter)

5063
03:24:16.241 --> 03:24:17.074
MATT: Okay.

5064
03:24:18.225 --> 03:24:19.058
So.

5065
03:24:20.516 --> 03:24:22.007
What's next? You summon your spider?

5066
03:24:22.007 --> 03:24:24.507
MICA: Yes, I use Conjure Woodland Beings

5067
03:24:24.507 --> 03:24:26.875
to summon an ice spider queen.

5068
03:24:26.875 --> 03:24:31.756
MATT: You see emerge from this green-blue glowing tear,

5069
03:24:31.756 --> 03:24:33.639
this horizontal tear through the middle of the air

5070
03:24:33.639 --> 03:24:35.907
in front of you. As it splits open

5071
03:24:35.907 --> 03:24:40.875
like a weird ethereal wound, this spindly series of legs,

5072
03:24:40.875 --> 03:24:43.122
black with blue stripes

5073
03:24:43.122 --> 03:24:46.042
and striations to them pour out as this large,

5074
03:24:46.042 --> 03:24:49.251
thin, elongated spider emerges.

5075
03:24:49.251 --> 03:24:53.241
You can see from tip of its multi-eyed face

5076
03:24:53.241 --> 03:24:56.258
to the back of its swollen blue abdomen,

5077
03:24:56.258 --> 03:24:59.931
probably about six and a half, seven feet.

5078
03:24:59.931 --> 03:25:03.209
Its legs go out to about 10 from side to side.

5079
03:25:03.209 --> 03:25:06.607
It is a unique, intimidating sight.

5080
03:25:06.607 --> 03:25:10.855
It (chittering), looks towards you.

5081
03:25:10.855 --> 03:25:14.415
MICA: So I want to first Druidcraft a little flower crown

5082
03:25:14.415 --> 03:25:16.896
for it, since it is a queen, and I want to

5083
03:25:16.896 --> 03:25:19.519
place it upon its head, and I pat it and I go:

5084
03:25:19.519 --> 03:25:22.133
You're going to do a good job for us today,

5085
03:25:22.133 --> 03:25:25.224
and I'm sorry, you're probably going to be eaten,

5086
03:25:25.224 --> 03:25:27.352
but I don't love you any less.

5087
03:25:27.352 --> 03:25:28.792
MATT: (chittering)

5088
03:25:28.792 --> 03:25:29.842
MICA: Go forth.

5089
03:25:29.842 --> 03:25:33.370
LAURA: I'm going to-- before this, I'm going to take

5090
03:25:33.370 --> 03:25:37.591
Sprinkle out of my hood and give him to Caleb--

5091
03:25:37.591 --> 03:25:39.977
no, to Caduceus-- no, to Caleb,

5092
03:25:39.977 --> 03:25:41.764
because he's definitely staying in the hut.

5093
03:25:41.764 --> 03:25:43.627
MARISHA: Oh, <i>ja</i>.

5094
03:25:43.627 --> 03:25:47.002
LAURA: Caleb, take care of Sprinkle, okay?

5095
03:25:47.002 --> 03:25:48.974
Oh my god, if Sprinkle would have been in my hood

5096
03:25:48.974 --> 03:25:50.310
when I tried to Dimension Door us out,

5097
03:25:50.310 --> 03:25:52.504
I wouldn't have been able to take you.

5098
03:25:52.504 --> 03:25:54.737
SAM: Oh my god, that's crazy.

5099
03:25:54.737 --> 03:25:56.432
LAURA: How terrible would that have been?

5100
03:25:56.432 --> 03:25:59.528
SAM: You've never Dimension Door'ed
with that creature on you before.

5101
03:25:59.528 --> 03:26:00.887
LAURA: I haven't.

5102
03:26:00.887 --> 03:26:02.190
(laughter)

5103
03:26:02.190 --> 03:26:03.028
MATT: All right.

5104
03:26:03.028 --> 03:26:05.489
(laughter)

5105
03:26:05.489 --> 03:26:06.722
(chittering)

5106
03:26:06.722 --> 03:26:08.963
MICA: Is the spider taking the shield?

5107
03:26:08.963 --> 03:26:10.421
How's this happening?

5108
03:26:10.421 --> 03:26:11.990
LAURA: No, the shield is already right there.

5109
03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:13.981
MICA: Oh, the shield's already placed? Okay.

5110
03:26:13.981 --> 03:26:16.342
MATT: The spider stands over, you direct her over.

5111
03:26:16.342 --> 03:26:17.522
(chittering)

5112
03:26:17.522 --> 03:26:21.689
MICA: Then I back up, I back far, I back back to the hut.

5113
03:26:21.689 --> 03:26:24.626
Okay, so you're in the hut, you're in the hut--

5114
03:26:24.626 --> 03:26:29.626
MARISHA: I am-- Caleb's in the hut, Beau is in invisible

5115
03:26:29.803 --> 03:26:33.787
with Nott and Jester on the opposite side.

5116
03:26:33.787 --> 03:26:36.381
TALIESIN: Before, just in case, I'm going to tap you

5117
03:26:36.381 --> 03:26:39.190
and give you Freedom of Movement.

5118
03:26:39.190 --> 03:26:40.742
MARISHA: Yes, queen.

5119
03:26:40.742 --> 03:26:44.882
Oh, and then Caleb wanted to

5120
03:26:44.882 --> 03:26:48.462
do Gift of Alacrity

5121
03:26:48.462 --> 03:26:52.224
on someone doing a crucial action.

5122
03:26:52.224 --> 03:26:55.339
MATT: Gift of Alacrity or you mean the other one?

5123
03:26:55.339 --> 03:26:58.577
SAM: The fate thing, probably.
MATT: Yeah.

5124
03:26:58.577 --> 03:27:00.870
MARISHA: Oh, he wants that on himself.

5125
03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:02.099
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

5126
03:27:02.099 --> 03:27:03.834
MARISHA: He made a point to make that.

5127
03:27:03.834 --> 03:27:07.371
Then Gift of Alacrity we'll put on Reani.

5128
03:27:07.371 --> 03:27:09.403
MATT: Okay, so you have a plus eight
to your initiative rolls.

5129
03:27:09.403 --> 03:27:11.019
MICA: Oh, damn.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

5130
03:27:11.019 --> 03:27:12.221
MATT: For the next hour, or eight hours.
SAM: He wanted the

5131
03:27:12.221 --> 03:27:14.405
fate thing for himself, got it.
LAURA: But okay. Okay.

5132
03:27:14.405 --> 03:27:16.616
TRAVIS: Shouldn't Jester have something?

5133
03:27:16.616 --> 03:27:19.564
LAURA: Doesn't matter, it's fine, I will just be out here

5134
03:27:19.564 --> 03:27:23.381
with Nott with no extra anything from anybody.

5135
03:27:23.381 --> 03:27:25.436
(laughter)

5136
03:27:25.436 --> 03:27:27.047
Thanks a lot, everyone.

5137
03:27:27.047 --> 03:27:28.683
We can take care of ourselves.

5138
03:27:28.683 --> 03:27:31.144
TRAVIS: We're <i>au naturale.</i>

5139
03:27:31.144 --> 03:27:32.807
(laughter)

5140
03:27:32.807 --> 03:27:34.090
SAM: See you, Fjord.

5141
03:27:34.090 --> 03:27:35.992
TRAVIS: You smell like booze.

5142
03:27:35.992 --> 03:27:38.077
(laughter)

5143
03:27:38.077 --> 03:27:39.479
You smell flammable.

5144
03:27:39.479 --> 03:27:41.426
(laughter)

5145
03:27:41.426 --> 03:27:42.427
MATT: Caduceus, where are you staying?

5146
03:27:42.427 --> 03:27:45.381
TALIESIN: I'm staying just behind dome,

5147
03:27:45.381 --> 03:27:47.556
if that makes sense, using it as cover.

5148
03:27:47.556 --> 03:27:48.457
MATT: Okay.

5149
03:27:48.457 --> 03:27:52.193
Behind the the dome, in the dome, in the dome.

5150
03:27:52.193 --> 03:27:54.504
TALIESIN: Or actually maybe in the dome.
MATT: Caleb definitely in the dome,

5151
03:27:54.504 --> 03:27:55.477
All right, Caduceus in the dome.

5152
03:27:55.477 --> 03:27:56.879
So you four are in the dome, the other three

5153
03:27:56.879 --> 03:28:00.816
are ahead, up, about 60 feet from ground zero

5154
03:28:00.816 --> 03:28:02.102
where the spider has been summoned

5155
03:28:02.102 --> 03:28:03.318
and is currently lording over the shield.

5156
03:28:03.318 --> 03:28:06.301
TRAVIS: I will be augment, I will be 30 feet--

5157
03:28:06.301 --> 03:28:08.516
25 feet of out of the dome.

5158
03:28:08.516 --> 03:28:12.019
That way if I need to pull, I grab and I just run in

5159
03:28:12.019 --> 03:28:13.679
instead of trying to do this shit.

5160
03:28:13.679 --> 03:28:14.928
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
LAURA: Oh, smart.

5161
03:28:14.928 --> 03:28:16.556
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: 25 feet from the dome.

5162
03:28:16.556 --> 03:28:19.048
MATT: All right, got it.

5163
03:28:20.198 --> 03:28:22.334
So, what's next?

5164
03:28:22.334 --> 03:28:23.408
SAM: We got to make some noise.

5165
03:28:23.408 --> 03:28:24.723
LAURA: Oh, right.
TRAVIS: 50 feet.

5166
03:28:24.723 --> 03:28:26.366
I'll be 50 feet outside of the dome.

5167
03:28:26.366 --> 03:28:27.924
MATT: Okay. You got it.

5168
03:28:27.924 --> 03:28:30.026
SAM: (laughing)
MICA: He's getting brave.

5169
03:28:30.026 --> 03:28:31.603
MARISHA: It's The Price is Right.

5170
03:28:31.603 --> 03:28:34.472
LAURA: I want to see-- wait,
let me look how far of a distance Thaumaturgy--

5171
03:28:34.472 --> 03:28:36.700
TALIESIN: You have 60 feet of movement
if you burn your action.

5172
03:28:36.700 --> 03:28:39.525
TRAVIS: I know. That's why I'm only using 50.

5173
03:28:39.525 --> 03:28:42.358
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use Thaumaturgy.

5174
03:28:43.507 --> 03:28:44.947
Then, oh, I'm going to-- oh fuck.

5175
03:28:44.947 --> 03:28:48.062
I'm going to get up close to the top of the tunnel,

5176
03:28:48.062 --> 03:28:50.916
to where it goes, and I'm going to use Thaumaturgy

5177
03:28:50.916 --> 03:28:55.916
to echo yeti noises up the tunnel shaft,

5178
03:28:56.110 --> 03:28:57.574
and then I'm going to make a run for it

5179
03:28:57.574 --> 03:29:00.240
and hide behind that stalagmite.

5180
03:29:00.240 --> 03:29:01.331
MATT: Okay.

5181
03:29:03.276 --> 03:29:04.626
Okay.

5182
03:29:07.428 --> 03:29:09.812
Make a performance check for me.

5183
03:29:13.817 --> 03:29:14.650
LAURA: 20.

5184
03:29:14.650 --> 03:29:16.438
MATT: All right.

5185
03:29:16.438 --> 03:29:17.366
SAM: When it counts.

5186
03:29:17.366 --> 03:29:21.292
MATT: This is a stretch of Thaumaturgy's capabilities.

5187
03:29:21.292 --> 03:29:23.062
So you make a noise, a thunderous noise

5188
03:29:23.062 --> 03:29:24.635
similar to a rumble of thunder,

5189
03:29:24.635 --> 03:29:26.764
but you sculpt it to be similar to

5190
03:29:26.764 --> 03:29:29.839
what you remember the yeti sounds to be like.

5191
03:29:29.839 --> 03:29:33.495
(growling)

5192
03:29:33.495 --> 03:29:35.270
Echoes through and you hear the echo

5193
03:29:35.270 --> 03:29:37.329
go up to the top.

5194
03:29:39.938 --> 03:29:41.663
A moment passes.

5195
03:29:43.660 --> 03:29:45.493
About a minute passes.

5196
03:29:50.388 --> 03:29:54.101
MICA: (whispering) Should I have my spider knock?

5197
03:29:54.101 --> 03:29:55.607
TRAVIS: What, like climb up and knock?

5198
03:29:55.607 --> 03:29:56.950
MICA: Yeah.

5199
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:58.422
TRAVIS: Climb up the ice wall?

5200
03:29:58.422 --> 03:30:00.522
MICA: It has sticky feets.

5201
03:30:02.796 --> 03:30:04.624
SAM: Sure.
TRAVIS: Yes.

5202
03:30:04.624 --> 03:30:07.292
MATT: (cracking) You hear this cracking impact sound.

5203
03:30:07.292 --> 03:30:09.542
(cracking)

5204
03:30:10.710 --> 03:30:12.915
Chunks of ice begin to fall and plummet.

5205
03:30:12.915 --> 03:30:15.249
(impacts)

5206
03:30:15.249 --> 03:30:18.277
A huge piece slams into the ground next to the spider.

5207
03:30:18.277 --> 03:30:20.628
(chittering) Backs out of the way.
TRAVIS: I wanna go home.

5208
03:30:20.628 --> 03:30:21.821
LAURA: I don't like it.

5209
03:30:21.821 --> 03:30:25.451
MATT: You hear-- (impacts)

5210
03:30:26.418 --> 03:30:29.251
With each heavy impact grinding sound,

5211
03:30:29.251 --> 03:30:31.729
more ice chunks fall, slamming into the ground.

5212
03:30:31.729 --> 03:30:34.963
It gets louder and the vibrations, the impact of the tunnel

5213
03:30:34.963 --> 03:30:38.263
rumbles, rumbles, and vibrates underneath you.

5214
03:30:42.408 --> 03:30:44.161
Right at the top of this tunnel,

5215
03:30:44.161 --> 03:30:48.022
you see these two white claws scraping into the ice

5216
03:30:48.022 --> 03:30:52.850
just into your view, as these two expanded wings

5217
03:30:52.850 --> 03:30:55.382
unfurl, covering the entirety

5218
03:30:55.382 --> 03:30:56.582
of the upper part of the cavern.

5219
03:30:56.582 --> 03:30:59.444
As it slowly holds itself looking down,

5220
03:30:59.444 --> 03:31:00.669
you can see the snout

5221
03:31:00.669 --> 03:31:03.110
of an ancient white dragon.

5222
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:04.479
LAURA and TRAVIS: Ancient?!

5223
03:31:04.479 --> 03:31:05.925
Fuck!
MICA: (groaning)

5224
03:31:05.925 --> 03:31:07.049
MATT: Peer down.

5225
03:31:07.049 --> 03:31:08.551
SAM: We've got this one.

5226
03:31:08.551 --> 03:31:12.716
MATT: Peer down and, maybe about 15 or so feet

5227
03:31:12.716 --> 03:31:17.447
from the spider, just-- (breathing heavily)

5228
03:31:17.447 --> 03:31:18.280
MARISHA: Oh god.

5229
03:31:18.280 --> 03:31:20.872
MATT: Blue mist (whooshing) out of its mouth.

5230
03:31:20.872 --> 03:31:24.689
You just barely see its glowing icy blue eyes.

5231
03:31:24.689 --> 03:31:25.922
It goes,

5232
03:31:27.714 --> 03:31:30.097
"Interesting."

5233
03:31:32.192 --> 03:31:33.871
(ice breath)

5234
03:31:33.871 --> 03:31:38.871
You watch as a blast of icy white blue force

5235
03:31:39.906 --> 03:31:42.511
just sprays out against this spider

5236
03:31:42.511 --> 03:31:45.378
and it billows out and pushes into the chamber.

5237
03:31:45.378 --> 03:31:48.243
It doesn't do damage to you guys from your proximity,

5238
03:31:48.243 --> 03:31:50.847
but the burst of cold still numbs

5239
03:31:50.847 --> 03:31:52.841
the surface of your skin at this distance.

5240
03:31:52.841 --> 03:31:53.936
LAURA: It feels kind of nice.

5241
03:31:53.936 --> 03:31:56.379
MATT: I need your spider to make a constitution

5242
03:31:56.379 --> 03:31:57.640
saving throw, please.

5243
03:31:57.640 --> 03:31:58.484
MICA: Okay.

5244
03:31:58.484 --> 03:32:01.731
TRAVIS: This is going to dictate whether
we bail on this or not.

5245
03:32:01.731 --> 03:32:02.619
MICA: All right.
SAM: Bail?

5246
03:32:02.619 --> 03:32:03.637
TRAVIS: Yeah, because if this is like--

5247
03:32:03.637 --> 03:32:04.498
SAM: No surrender!

5248
03:32:04.498 --> 03:32:07.119
TRAVIS: If this is like 12d12, we're
fucking getting out of here.

5249
03:32:07.119 --> 03:32:08.805
MICA: That's a solid 13.

5250
03:32:08.805 --> 03:32:09.958
MATT: 13, that's a failure.

5251
03:32:09.958 --> 03:32:11.876
MICA: Yeah, I figured.

5252
03:32:11.876 --> 03:32:13.446
But it has a resistance to cold.

5253
03:32:13.446 --> 03:32:15.776
MATT: It does, and that's useful.

5254
03:32:15.776 --> 03:32:19.101
All righty, so.
TRAVIS: That's helpful.

5255
03:32:21.879 --> 03:32:23.791
MATT: Let me roll some dice here for a second.

5256
03:32:23.791 --> 03:32:25.551
MICA: Yeah, I may need more spiders.

5257
03:32:25.551 --> 03:32:27.662
TRAVIS: Ancient white dragon.

5258
03:32:27.662 --> 03:32:30.694
LAURA: That's it? Oh god.
TALIESIN: Should've cast Bless.

5259
03:32:30.694 --> 03:32:34.323
LAURA: Should've done a fucking mammoth.

5260
03:32:34.323 --> 03:32:36.578
MARISHA: Mammoth is round two, round two.

5261
03:32:36.578 --> 03:32:38.146
You can tag in a mammoth.

5262
03:32:38.146 --> 03:32:39.422
MICA: Yeah, then you would die.

5263
03:32:39.422 --> 03:32:40.909
LAURA: Okay, yeah, you're right.

5264
03:32:40.909 --> 03:32:42.355
MATT: 74 points of cold damage.

5265
03:32:42.355 --> 03:32:43.694
LAURA: Oh!
SAM: It's okay. No, no, no.

5266
03:32:43.694 --> 03:32:44.925
MATT: Reduced to half.
MICA: Oh.

5267
03:32:44.925 --> 03:32:46.287
SAM: Resistant.
MARISHA: Resistant, yeah yeah yeah.

5268
03:32:46.287 --> 03:32:48.097
MICA: Can somebody math for me?

5269
03:32:48.097 --> 03:32:49.325
SAM: You're okay.

5270
03:32:49.325 --> 03:32:50.885
LAURA: 74 is 32.

5271
03:32:50.885 --> 03:32:52.039
MATT: Well, no.
LAURA: No.

5272
03:32:52.039 --> 03:32:54.397
MATT: 37 points of cold damage.

5273
03:32:54.397 --> 03:32:55.916
MICA: It's okay.
LAURA: 37.

5274
03:32:55.916 --> 03:33:00.653
MATT: So it blasts into the spider,
you see ice collecting

5275
03:33:00.653 --> 03:33:02.893
around the outside of its carapace.

5276
03:33:04.527 --> 03:33:07.481
The dragon looks down curiously at it

5277
03:33:07.481 --> 03:33:11.199
still surviving there, its head turning a bit.

5278
03:33:11.199 --> 03:33:14.046
The mist still (whooshing) out of its mouth.

5279
03:33:14.046 --> 03:33:15.433
LAURA: We look in, can we see--

5280
03:33:15.433 --> 03:33:16.974
MATT: Make a perception check.
MARISHA: The mithral.

5281
03:33:16.974 --> 03:33:19.457
SAM: I will also make one.
MARISHA: Okay, are you looking at the mithral?

5282
03:33:19.457 --> 03:33:21.660
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Can I do the same?

5283
03:33:21.660 --> 03:33:23.281
MATT: Sure.

5284
03:33:23.281 --> 03:33:24.114
SAM: Six.

5285
03:33:25.692 --> 03:33:27.926
LAURA: 23.
MATT: 23, and--?

5286
03:33:28.832 --> 03:33:29.665
MARISHA: 16.

5287
03:33:29.665 --> 03:33:31.179
MATT: 16, okay.

5288
03:33:32.171 --> 03:33:35.695
With all the ice, and all the insanity that's happened,

5289
03:33:35.695 --> 03:33:37.646
the only person with clear enough eyes

5290
03:33:37.646 --> 03:33:39.647
to see the mithral is Jester.

5291
03:33:39.647 --> 03:33:42.433
Peering through all of it, you look and see,

5292
03:33:42.433 --> 03:33:43.900
it's not quite glowing yet.

5293
03:33:43.900 --> 03:33:45.214
MARISHA: Yeah.

5294
03:33:45.214 --> 03:33:46.795
MATT: What's the spider do, if anything?

5295
03:33:46.795 --> 03:33:49.342
MICA: So can I still communicate with it

5296
03:33:49.342 --> 03:33:50.385
even though I'm in the hut?

5297
03:33:50.385 --> 03:33:52.092
MATT: You're giving it-- from this distance,

5298
03:33:52.092 --> 03:33:54.095
I'd say you'd probably have to step out to try and--

5299
03:33:54.095 --> 03:33:57.770
MICA: Okay, so, the dragon can't see me
if I step out, right?

5300
03:33:57.770 --> 03:33:58.795
MATT: You don't think so.

5301
03:33:58.795 --> 03:34:00.493
LAURA: Just put your face barely through.

5302
03:34:00.493 --> 03:34:03.662
MICA: So I want to put my face barely out,

5303
03:34:03.662 --> 03:34:06.780
just so I can tell the spider to,

5304
03:34:06.780 --> 03:34:09.361
in its own spider way, like flip off the dragon,

5305
03:34:09.361 --> 03:34:11.269
since it's still alive. (laughs)

5306
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:13.864
A little just leg just goes up and goes--

5307
03:34:13.864 --> 03:34:15.253
MATT: Okay.

5308
03:34:15.253 --> 03:34:17.295
MICA: And then I pop back in.
MATT: Can the spider heal itself?

5309
03:34:17.295 --> 03:34:21.063
MATT: The spider, which looked like it was
about to back away instinctually,

5310
03:34:21.063 --> 03:34:24.352
its need to run from this massive creature,

5311
03:34:24.352 --> 03:34:27.275
it resists it at your will, by which it's been

5312
03:34:27.275 --> 03:34:30.832
brought to bear at your beck and call.

5313
03:34:30.832 --> 03:34:32.091
MICA: Sorry, buddy.

5314
03:34:32.091 --> 03:34:35.385
MATT: Bears back, and its the third right leg

5315
03:34:35.385 --> 03:34:38.707
curls up under its abdomen and sticks it

5316
03:34:38.707 --> 03:34:40.524
straight up towards the dragon.

5317
03:34:40.524 --> 03:34:42.182
(laughter)

5318
03:34:42.182 --> 03:34:45.530
Which gets its breath back. And the dragon goes,

5319
03:34:45.530 --> 03:34:49.389
"Heh, (breathing heavily)," and just releases

5320
03:34:49.389 --> 03:34:51.848
an even angrier torrent of ice blasting down.

5321
03:34:51.848 --> 03:34:54.701
This blasts back into all of you,

5322
03:34:54.701 --> 03:34:57.081
I'll say just make a dexterity saving throw,

5323
03:34:57.081 --> 03:34:58.498
the three of you.

5324
03:34:59.583 --> 03:35:02.359
MICA: Sorry, this is for the greater good.

5325
03:35:02.359 --> 03:35:03.345
LAURA: 14.

5326
03:35:03.345 --> 03:35:04.631
SAM: 23.

5327
03:35:04.631 --> 03:35:06.153
MARISHA: You said dex saving throw?

5328
03:35:06.153 --> 03:35:07.561
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: 16.

5329
03:35:07.561 --> 03:35:08.871
MATT: 16, okay.

5330
03:35:08.871 --> 03:35:12.273
MATT: The proximity does seven points of cold damage to--

5331
03:35:12.273 --> 03:35:13.777
what'd you roll? Sorry, it was--?

5332
03:35:13.777 --> 03:35:15.867
MARISHA: 16.
MATT: 16, fail.

5333
03:35:15.867 --> 03:35:17.281
LAURA: 14.
MATT: 14, fail.

5334
03:35:17.281 --> 03:35:18.478
SAM: 23.
MARISHA: Evasion.

5335
03:35:18.478 --> 03:35:19.366
MATT: 23, you succeed.

5336
03:35:19.366 --> 03:35:21.968
So you take only three points of cold damage,

5337
03:35:21.968 --> 03:35:23.415
seven to both of you.
LAURA: I'm resistant.

5338
03:35:23.415 --> 03:35:24.442
MATT: So three to you as well.

5339
03:35:24.442 --> 03:35:26.117
SAM: Evasion.
MARISHA: Evasion.

5340
03:35:26.117 --> 03:35:27.486
MATT: There you go.
MARISHA: Evasion.

5341
03:35:27.486 --> 03:35:29.644
MATT: Take nothing.

5342
03:35:29.644 --> 03:35:31.782
MARISHA: Wait, I thought I take half damage if I fail.

5343
03:35:31.782 --> 03:35:33.459
MATT: No, you take half damage if you fail.

5344
03:35:33.459 --> 03:35:35.105
So--
MARISHA: And I failed.

5345
03:35:35.105 --> 03:35:39.272
MATT: Yeah, so you take three, and you take none.

5346
03:35:40.756 --> 03:35:44.156
LAURA: <i>You</i> get three cold damage,
<i>you</i> get three cold damage!

5347
03:35:46.648 --> 03:35:49.414
MATT: The spider takes--
MICA: The spider's fucked.

5348
03:35:49.414 --> 03:35:50.747
SAM: Spider's gone.

5349
03:35:52.706 --> 03:35:56.191
MATT: 68 points of cold damage, reduced by half.

5350
03:35:56.191 --> 03:35:57.840
MICA: That's a little bit of an overkill,

5351
03:35:57.840 --> 03:36:00.278
but yeah, the spider is <i>no mas</i>.

5352
03:36:00.278 --> 03:36:02.899
MATT: So after the torrent of (hissing) blast downward,

5353
03:36:02.899 --> 03:36:05.395
the mist subsides and you can see now,

5354
03:36:05.395 --> 03:36:07.756
there's this large block of ice

5355
03:36:07.756 --> 03:36:10.732
that has encased and entombed the spider.

5356
03:36:10.732 --> 03:36:14.311
The dragon snarls its nostrils

5357
03:36:14.311 --> 03:36:19.004
and then bites down, sinks its teeth into the block of ice,

5358
03:36:19.004 --> 03:36:22.143
and then scurries up into the cavern, lifting it up with it.

5359
03:36:22.143 --> 03:36:24.320
The rope begins to zip along with it.

5360
03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:26.238
LAURA: The mithral was on the ground!

5361
03:36:26.238 --> 03:36:27.178
MARISHA: The mithral's on the ground.

5362
03:36:27.178 --> 03:36:28.403
What does it look like?

5363
03:36:28.403 --> 03:36:30.068
MATT: It looks like this chunk of ice is carrying

5364
03:36:30.068 --> 03:36:32.054
the mithral with it and rope with it.

5365
03:36:32.054 --> 03:36:34.851
You can see now, the slack go and start pulling you forward.

5366
03:36:34.851 --> 03:36:36.131
Fjord, what are you doing?

5367
03:36:36.131 --> 03:36:37.648
TRAVIS: I'm holding onto that bitch.

5368
03:36:37.648 --> 03:36:39.998
LAURA: We see the rope going past us,
I grab onto the rope, too.

5369
03:36:39.998 --> 03:36:42.093
MICA: Can I hold onto Fjord?
Because I'm in the hut with him?

5370
03:36:42.093 --> 03:36:43.387
Oh no, I'm not, no, I'm out of the hut.

5371
03:36:43.387 --> 03:36:44.470
SAM: He's 50 feet away.
MICA: Shit.

5372
03:36:44.470 --> 03:36:46.822
MATT: Yeah, Fjord just darts away from you guys.

5373
03:36:46.822 --> 03:36:48.630
LAURA: We're seeing the rope slide past us, right?

5374
03:36:48.630 --> 03:36:49.540
MATT: You are.

5375
03:36:49.540 --> 03:36:50.752
LAURA: So yeah, I grab onto the rope, too.

5376
03:36:50.752 --> 03:36:51.585
MATT: You grab onto the rope?

5377
03:36:51.585 --> 03:36:53.712
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

5378
03:36:53.712 --> 03:36:57.395
SAM: I will also grab onto the rope?

5379
03:36:57.395 --> 03:36:59.745
LAURA: We might be able to just yank the rope down.

5380
03:36:59.745 --> 03:37:02.111
Like, with whatever it is.

5381
03:37:02.111 --> 03:37:03.384
Knock it loose, because it's at the bottom

5382
03:37:03.384 --> 03:37:04.743
of whatever ice chunk it would be going up.

5383
03:37:04.743 --> 03:37:05.692
MATT: Yes, it's lifting up.

5384
03:37:05.692 --> 03:37:06.989
Make a strength check.
LAURA: Yeah.

5385
03:37:06.989 --> 03:37:08.650
MATT: Is anyone helping?

5386
03:37:08.650 --> 03:37:10.051
SAM: I will help.
MARISHA: I will help as well.

5387
03:37:10.051 --> 03:37:11.636
MATT: All right, so you get advantage
on this strength check.

5388
03:37:11.636 --> 03:37:12.469
LAURA: Okay.

5389
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:16.072
MARISHA: Can I help by throwing two of my shurikens

5390
03:37:16.072 --> 03:37:18.128
and seeing if I can cut--

5391
03:37:18.128 --> 03:37:20.275
SAM: Well, you can't help pull a rope and throw.

5392
03:37:20.275 --> 03:37:23.208
MARISHA: No, I'm not, that's what I'm saying,

5393
03:37:23.208 --> 03:37:25.775
see if I can throw--
LAURA: Did I get Bless, did you Bless me?

5394
03:37:25.775 --> 03:37:26.861
TALIESIN: How close are you to me?

5395
03:37:26.861 --> 03:37:28.795
MARISHA: Cut the rope.
MATT: Sure, roll an attack.

5396
03:37:28.795 --> 03:37:31.171
TRAVIS and LAURA: Don't cut the rope!

5397
03:37:31.171 --> 03:37:33.295
LAURA: We need the rope!

5398
03:37:33.295 --> 03:37:36.931
MARISHA: After the thing, after, I'm throwing it.

5399
03:37:36.931 --> 03:37:40.493
After the-- so it's not connected to the dragon.

5400
03:37:40.493 --> 03:37:41.421
LAURA: No no no no--

5401
03:37:41.421 --> 03:37:43.578
TRAVIS: No, I'm holding onto the rope, I could let go.

5402
03:37:43.578 --> 03:37:44.861
I don't want to lose the ore.

5403
03:37:44.861 --> 03:37:47.230
SAM: The rope is frozen to the--

5404
03:37:47.230 --> 03:37:49.532
LAURA: The rope is frozen onto the shield
which is connected to the ice chunk.

5405
03:37:49.532 --> 03:37:51.419
If you cut the rope, we'll lose the mithral.

5406
03:37:51.419 --> 03:37:54.578
MATT: We'll say-- you're invisible, right?
MARISHA: Yes.

5407
03:37:54.578 --> 03:37:56.057
MATT: They wouldn't even see you doing this.

5408
03:37:56.057 --> 03:37:57.337
MARISHA: Okay, it's fine.

5409
03:37:57.337 --> 03:38:00.391
MATT: Roll an attack with your shuriken.

5410
03:38:00.391 --> 03:38:01.853
There's no way to communicate this

5411
03:38:01.853 --> 03:38:03.723
in the moment it happened, this was the first instinct.

5412
03:38:03.723 --> 03:38:04.830
SAM and LAURA: It's fine.

5413
03:38:04.830 --> 03:38:06.769
MARISHA: This is my ranged dex?
MATT: Correct.

5414
03:38:06.769 --> 03:38:07.616
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on.

5415
03:38:07.616 --> 03:38:10.491
TRAVIS: It might be shitty, it might be shitty.

5416
03:38:10.491 --> 03:38:12.461
MARISHA: Hang on, 13.

5417
03:38:12.461 --> 03:38:13.785
MATT: 13?
MARISHA: Yes.

5418
03:38:13.785 --> 03:38:17.013
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.
SAM: Oh boy.

5419
03:38:17.013 --> 03:38:18.410
Shuriken!

5420
03:38:22.276 --> 03:38:24.847
MARISHA: Okay, what is it for the darts?

5421
03:38:24.847 --> 03:38:26.481
MATT: 1d4 plus your dexterity modifier.

5422
03:38:26.481 --> 03:38:27.923
MARISHA: Plus my dex modifier.

5423
03:38:27.923 --> 03:38:29.232
Okay, okay.

5424
03:38:30.326 --> 03:38:32.676
MARISHA: Eight damage.
MATT: Okay.

5425
03:38:32.676 --> 03:38:35.158
The rope goes slack in your guys'--

5426
03:38:35.158 --> 03:38:37.164
LAURA: Would she have done it before I was yanking the rope,

5427
03:38:37.164 --> 03:38:39.423
would she have done that before I--

5428
03:38:39.423 --> 03:38:40.745
MATT: What did you roll with your strength check?

5429
03:38:40.745 --> 03:38:42.485
LAURA: 19?
MATT: 19.

5430
03:38:42.485 --> 03:38:46.648
You yank, the rope actually snaps with your strength.

5431
03:38:46.648 --> 03:38:49.665
There is no way you're holding an ancient dragon

5432
03:38:49.665 --> 03:38:51.245
pulling up into an ice cavern--

5433
03:38:51.245 --> 03:38:53.565
LAURA: No, I wanted to yank the shield off.

5434
03:38:53.565 --> 03:38:56.444
MATT: Unfortunately no, because as it pulls up and you see,

5435
03:38:56.444 --> 03:38:59.844
like, it froze the ice that was underneath

5436
03:38:59.844 --> 03:39:01.157
to whatever is there.

5437
03:39:01.157 --> 03:39:03.512
So a lot of the chunks of people, including the ice,

5438
03:39:03.512 --> 03:39:05.789
the ice is somehow captured up in the ice,

5439
03:39:05.789 --> 03:39:07.332
and it's now being lifted up the cavern.

5440
03:39:07.332 --> 03:39:08.885
SAM: We're going up, then.

5441
03:39:08.885 --> 03:39:10.828
MATT: So as the rope goes slack, you guys all

5442
03:39:10.828 --> 03:39:14.768
take a moment as you hear (impacts),

5443
03:39:14.768 --> 03:39:16.271
a couple other odd pieces falling.

5444
03:39:16.271 --> 03:39:18.240
TRAVIS: It's all right.

5445
03:39:19.331 --> 03:39:21.648
SAM: As it was flying away, did we happen to see

5446
03:39:21.648 --> 03:39:23.591
a glowing piece of mithral in the ice?

5447
03:39:23.591 --> 03:39:26.405
LAURA: Yeah, could we see if it was glowing?

5448
03:39:26.405 --> 03:39:28.783
LAURA: You would've been far away.
MATT: You would've been further away.

5449
03:39:28.783 --> 03:39:31.216
I'll say both of you make a perception check.

5450
03:39:33.576 --> 03:39:34.561
SAM: Not me.

5451
03:39:34.561 --> 03:39:36.274
LAURA: 24.
MATT: 24?

5452
03:39:36.274 --> 03:39:39.986
You did see a faint blue glow about a foot or so

5453
03:39:39.986 --> 03:39:42.178
within the bottom of the ice crystal

5454
03:39:42.178 --> 03:39:43.411
being dragged up to the top.

5455
03:39:43.411 --> 03:39:44.577
SAM: Okay, okay.

5456
03:39:44.577 --> 03:39:48.650
TALIESIN: So this is definitely a
glass half-full proposition.

5457
03:39:48.650 --> 03:39:50.855
TRAVIS: (laughing) Sure.

5458
03:39:50.855 --> 03:39:53.804
MICA: Or we could just go get another piece.

5459
03:39:53.804 --> 03:39:55.576
LAURA: No, no, no.

5460
03:39:55.576 --> 03:39:57.834
SAM: We're going up there.
MARISHA: All right.

5461
03:39:57.834 --> 03:39:59.084
LAURA: We sneak up.

5462
03:39:59.084 --> 03:40:01.115
TALIESIN: This is now a theft.
LAURA: Now it's a stealth mission.

5463
03:40:01.115 --> 03:40:02.830
SAM: That's right.
MARISHA: Yeah, now it's recovery.

5464
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:05.212
SAM: This couldn't have gone any better!

5465
03:40:05.212 --> 03:40:06.979
TALIESIN: It really could've, but that's okay.

5466
03:40:06.979 --> 03:40:08.491
(laughter)

5467
03:40:08.491 --> 03:40:09.774
I can think of a number of scenarios

5468
03:40:09.774 --> 03:40:11.082
where this could've gone way better.

5469
03:40:11.082 --> 03:40:14.076
TRAVIS: We need to wait for the dragon
to eat the ice, right?

5470
03:40:14.076 --> 03:40:15.429
Break up the block.

5471
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:17.715
SAM: Most people, when they eat, they get tired

5472
03:40:17.715 --> 03:40:19.618
and go to sleep afterwards.

5473
03:40:19.618 --> 03:40:23.329
TRAVIS: All right, yes, could be a nap after.

5474
03:40:23.329 --> 03:40:25.944
LAURA: I don't think we should take the whole group,

5475
03:40:25.944 --> 03:40:28.404
I think it should be a couple sneakies,

5476
03:40:28.404 --> 03:40:31.521
go in, get the mithral, and bamf out.

5477
03:40:31.521 --> 03:40:36.138
TRAVIS: I would say Nott, but she reeks of petrol.

5478
03:40:36.138 --> 03:40:37.964
It's insane.

5479
03:40:37.964 --> 03:40:40.642
LAURA: Nott, can you turn me invisible?

5480
03:40:40.642 --> 03:40:42.661
SAM: Yes, but I'm not sending you in alone.

5481
03:40:42.661 --> 03:40:44.599
LAURA: I can cast Pass Without a Trace on myself.

5482
03:40:44.599 --> 03:40:46.833
SAM: I'm not sending you in alone.

5483
03:40:46.833 --> 03:40:49.913
MICA: I have Pass Without a Trace, I can go.

5484
03:40:49.913 --> 03:40:51.496
LAURA: Are you stealthy?

5485
03:40:53.067 --> 03:40:54.285
MICA: Eh.
MARISHA: I'm stealthy.

5486
03:40:54.285 --> 03:40:55.292
SAM: I'm stealthy.

5487
03:40:55.292 --> 03:40:58.181
TRAVIS: How much worse do you roll when you're hammered?

5488
03:40:58.181 --> 03:40:59.247
SAM: Just a little.

5489
03:40:59.247 --> 03:41:00.293
TRAVIS: (laughing)

5490
03:41:00.293 --> 03:41:02.606
This is what you do, rogues going to rogue.

5491
03:41:02.606 --> 03:41:04.862
SAM: Yeah, I'm still amazing.

5492
03:41:04.862 --> 03:41:06.229
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah, yeah.

5493
03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:09.117
SAM: First of all, stealth I get advantage on every roll,

5494
03:41:09.117 --> 03:41:11.784
so I'm actually totally fine.

5495
03:41:11.784 --> 03:41:13.543
MATT: Yeah, for you it counteracts the effect.

5496
03:41:13.543 --> 03:41:15.446
SAM: It counteracts, so I'm fine with stealth.

5497
03:41:15.446 --> 03:41:17.170
TRAVIS: That's a given, that's a given.

5498
03:41:17.170 --> 03:41:19.847
TALIESIN: We should maybe get everybody a little closer

5499
03:41:19.847 --> 03:41:23.255
to the den so that when we do bamf out, we can bamf out.

5500
03:41:23.255 --> 03:41:27.236
We only need 60 seconds unencumbered.

5501
03:41:27.236 --> 03:41:30.067
LAURA: I can Dimension Door 500 feet.

5502
03:41:30.067 --> 03:41:32.090
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, yeah, exactly, we should be

5503
03:41:32.090 --> 03:41:35.855
close to the dome and let them do--

5504
03:41:35.855 --> 03:41:37.595
SAM: You could turn into something that flies, right?

5505
03:41:37.595 --> 03:41:38.561
MICA: Mm-hmm.
SAM: So you could get

5506
03:41:38.561 --> 03:41:40.042
out of there in a hurry as well.

5507
03:41:40.042 --> 03:41:40.875
MICA: Mm-hmm.

5508
03:41:40.875 --> 03:41:41.809
TRAVIS: Flying dragon.

5509
03:41:41.809 --> 03:41:43.639
MICA: Dragons can also fly, yeah.

5510
03:41:43.639 --> 03:41:46.096
SAM: But you're super fast and awesome.

5511
03:41:46.096 --> 03:41:47.912
You're a superhero.

5512
03:41:47.912 --> 03:41:49.041
TRAVIS: That thing's faster.

5513
03:41:49.041 --> 03:41:50.723
MICA: That is true.

5514
03:41:50.723 --> 03:41:51.707
That is true.

5515
03:41:51.707 --> 03:41:53.422
SAM: You make your own decisions, Reani, but--

5516
03:41:53.422 --> 03:41:55.800
TRAVIS: We should move quite quickly, just in case.

5517
03:41:55.800 --> 03:41:57.258
SAM: You were told in a dream that you needed

5518
03:41:57.258 --> 03:41:59.266
to tangle with this dragon.

5519
03:41:59.266 --> 03:42:00.766
MICA: I'll go with you to protect you.

5520
03:42:00.766 --> 03:42:01.988
SAM: Thank you.

5521
03:42:01.988 --> 03:42:03.184
LAURA: But you've got to be stealthy.

5522
03:42:03.184 --> 03:42:04.017
MICA: Okay.

5523
03:42:05.292 --> 03:42:08.736
TALIESIN: We should all start heading in that direction.

5524
03:42:08.736 --> 03:42:10.448
MARISHA: No, I didn't say anything.

5525
03:42:10.448 --> 03:42:12.962
TRAVIS: Go, go, whatever you're going to do,
but do it quickly.

5526
03:42:12.962 --> 03:42:14.250
TALIESIN: Yeah, we should move.

5527
03:42:14.250 --> 03:42:16.358
LAURA: Reani, what if you turn into

5528
03:42:16.358 --> 03:42:19.895
a giant eagle or something, stealthily fly us up,

5529
03:42:19.895 --> 03:42:21.695
you can drop me and Nott up at the top.

5530
03:42:21.695 --> 03:42:23.636
MICA: And I will be your getaway car.

5531
03:42:23.636 --> 03:42:24.902
LAURA: Well, I have Dimension Door.

5532
03:42:24.902 --> 03:42:26.329
MICA: Just kidding.

5533
03:42:26.329 --> 03:42:27.854
LAURA: So that's probably faster.

5534
03:42:27.854 --> 03:42:29.012
MICA: That makes sense.

5535
03:42:29.012 --> 03:42:31.560
LAURA: But if something goes wrong--

5536
03:42:31.560 --> 03:42:32.462
MICA: I'll save you.

5537
03:42:32.462 --> 03:42:34.380
LAURA: Yes.
MICA: Okay.

5538
03:42:34.380 --> 03:42:35.547
I can do that.

5539
03:42:37.455 --> 03:42:38.288
TRAVIS: Go.

5540
03:42:39.922 --> 03:42:40.922
MICA: All right.

5541
03:42:42.065 --> 03:42:45.559
LAURA: Or you can go in and, you know, fight the dragon

5542
03:42:45.559 --> 03:42:49.087
and distract it, since it is,

5543
03:42:49.087 --> 03:42:52.782
you know, your call to action, and maybe you will land

5544
03:42:52.782 --> 03:42:55.354
a killing blow on its secret weak spot,

5545
03:42:55.354 --> 03:42:58.951
and your god will be very proud of you.

5546
03:42:58.951 --> 03:43:00.323
MICA: If that's what you want me to do--

5547
03:43:00.323 --> 03:43:01.629
LAURA: No, I don't.

5548
03:43:01.629 --> 03:43:02.973
TRAVIS: Must go, must go.

5549
03:43:02.973 --> 03:43:05.613
MATT: You can hear the very faint sound of crunching

5550
03:43:05.613 --> 03:43:08.504
echoing from further down the hall.

5551
03:43:08.504 --> 03:43:10.187
TALIESIN: From the other end of the hall?

5552
03:43:10.187 --> 03:43:12.212
MATT: No, from the direction the dragon went.

5553
03:43:12.212 --> 03:43:13.578
TALIESIN: The dragon's eating right now,

5554
03:43:13.578 --> 03:43:15.278
we should probably move.

5555
03:43:15.278 --> 03:43:16.974
TRAVIS: No, we're not all going, it's only

5556
03:43:16.974 --> 03:43:19.018
the three of you, or the two of you.

5557
03:43:19.018 --> 03:43:21.141
SAM: Chaos crew?
MARISHA: Chaos crew.

5558
03:43:21.141 --> 03:43:23.329
LAURA: Jesus Christ, chaos crew.
SAM: Let's go.

5559
03:43:23.329 --> 03:43:24.606
MICA: Am I going?
MARISHA: Yeah.

5560
03:43:24.606 --> 03:43:27.347
MICA: Okay.
MARISHA: All right.

5561
03:43:27.347 --> 03:43:29.634
MATT: So what's going on, who's going where?

5562
03:43:29.634 --> 03:43:31.284
SAM: We're going to start climbing the ice. Beau--

5563
03:43:31.284 --> 03:43:32.492
MICA: Wait, I can carry you.

5564
03:43:32.492 --> 03:43:34.458
LAURA: I can also--
SAM: Okay. Great, even better.

5565
03:43:34.458 --> 03:43:36.126
LAURA: I can Dimension Door us up and--

5566
03:43:36.126 --> 03:43:39.018
MATT: It is smooth ice, there are like grooves in it,

5567
03:43:39.018 --> 03:43:40.603
you can see now from the dragon

5568
03:43:40.603 --> 03:43:42.893
first dragging its way down in areas

5569
03:43:42.893 --> 03:43:44.134
where its claws hit there.

5570
03:43:44.134 --> 03:43:45.476
Without climbing gear,

5571
03:43:45.476 --> 03:43:47.389
it's going to be difficult to climb straight up,

5572
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:49.245
just as a note.

5573
03:43:49.245 --> 03:43:51.374
MICA: If I Pass Without a Trace as--

5574
03:43:51.374 --> 03:43:53.559
I can't cast that as an eagle.

5575
03:43:53.559 --> 03:43:57.155
MATT: You can cast it and maintain concentration
while in eagle form.

5576
03:43:57.155 --> 03:43:59.898
MICA: Okay. Would that be a sneaky eagle?

5577
03:43:59.898 --> 03:44:02.044
MATT: Yeah, I'd say that would be a quiet way

5578
03:44:02.044 --> 03:44:04.714
of making sure there's the least amount of wind noise

5579
03:44:04.714 --> 03:44:06.067
and landing gently.

5580
03:44:06.067 --> 03:44:09.237
MICA: Like one of those stealth jets, would I just hover up?

5581
03:44:09.237 --> 03:44:11.433
MATT: Yeah. It's a little bit more of an owl type maneuver.

5582
03:44:11.433 --> 03:44:13.659
MICA: Okay, actually wait, I can be an owl.

5583
03:44:13.659 --> 03:44:15.703
Are owls sneakier?

5584
03:44:15.703 --> 03:44:18.014
MATT: Generally, from a knowledge of nature,

5585
03:44:18.014 --> 03:44:21.455
the feathers of owls are designed to be stealthy predators.

5586
03:44:21.455 --> 03:44:22.288
MICA: Okay.

5587
03:44:22.288 --> 03:44:23.857
MATT: Do you have a giant owl at your disposal?

5588
03:44:23.857 --> 03:44:25.066
MICA: I have a giant owl.

5589
03:44:25.066 --> 03:44:27.487
MATT: A giant owl I would say would probably be--

5590
03:44:27.487 --> 03:44:28.400
TALIESIN: Also night vision.

5591
03:44:28.400 --> 03:44:29.376
MICA: Also night vision.

5592
03:44:29.376 --> 03:44:30.338
MATT: Yeah.
MICA: Okay.

5593
03:44:30.338 --> 03:44:32.759
So I would like to first cast Pass Without a Trace.

5594
03:44:32.759 --> 03:44:33.752
MATT: Okay.

5595
03:44:33.752 --> 03:44:35.786
TRAVIS: Hold on, hold on.
MICA: Huh?

5596
03:44:35.786 --> 03:44:40.134
TRAVIS: You have the ability to just get there, no sound.

5597
03:44:40.134 --> 03:44:41.432
LAURA: Yeah, I have Dimension Door.

5598
03:44:41.432 --> 03:44:43.291
TRAVIS: Then why don't you just do that?

5599
03:44:43.291 --> 03:44:45.607
TALIESIN: You have to see where you're going.

5600
03:44:45.607 --> 03:44:47.668
LAURA: Right, it could be useful.

5601
03:44:47.668 --> 03:44:50.847
If we're on your back as a giant owl,

5602
03:44:50.847 --> 03:44:52.933
is that what we're doing?

5603
03:44:52.933 --> 03:44:56.357
MICA: Either on my back or in my claws.

5604
03:44:56.357 --> 03:44:58.590
LAURA: Can you carry three of us?

5605
03:44:58.590 --> 03:45:01.024
MICA: Well, you're small, so, yeah.

5606
03:45:01.024 --> 03:45:02.754
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

5607
03:45:02.754 --> 03:45:03.671
MARISHA: You sure?

5608
03:45:04.881 --> 03:45:07.247
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Sure.

5609
03:45:07.247 --> 03:45:08.624
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend--

5610
03:45:08.624 --> 03:45:10.780
LAURA: Then you can be in charge of getting Beau back down,

5611
03:45:10.780 --> 03:45:12.866
because I can only take one person.

5612
03:45:12.866 --> 03:45:13.737
MICA: Okay.

5613
03:45:13.737 --> 03:45:15.241
LAURA: Back with me.

5614
03:45:15.241 --> 03:45:17.226
TALIESIN: I'm going to put Freedom of Movement
on you, too, then,

5615
03:45:17.226 --> 03:45:19.446
before we--
LAURA: Okay.

5616
03:45:19.446 --> 03:45:21.826
TALIESIN: Just going to burn through a couple spells.

5617
03:45:21.826 --> 03:45:25.026
MICA: Don't I have something special from Caleb?

5618
03:45:25.026 --> 03:45:26.537
Oh, that's just--
MARISHA: Plus to initiative.

5619
03:45:26.537 --> 03:45:27.579
MICA: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5620
03:45:27.579 --> 03:45:28.995
MATT: Yeah.
MICA: All right.

5621
03:45:28.995 --> 03:45:32.308
MATT: All right, so who's going with the giant owl?

5622
03:45:32.308 --> 03:45:33.894
MICA: All three of them are.

5623
03:45:33.894 --> 03:45:35.649
LAURA: Will you be able to move stealthily

5624
03:45:35.649 --> 03:45:38.231
with three of us in tow?

5625
03:45:38.231 --> 03:45:41.619
MATT: With Pass Without a Trace, you can certainly try.

5626
03:45:41.619 --> 03:45:43.366
TRAVIS: Boy.

5627
03:45:43.366 --> 03:45:44.422
Boy.

5628
03:45:44.422 --> 03:45:46.825
MATT: I mean, Nott's pretty small,
Beau's pretty light weight,

5629
03:45:46.825 --> 03:45:49.327
you have some more armor on, but--

5630
03:45:49.327 --> 03:45:50.424
LAURA: A little bit.

5631
03:45:50.424 --> 03:45:53.442
MICA: If Nott's like hanging on to the scruff, very small,

5632
03:45:53.442 --> 03:45:56.479
and then carrying the two in the claws, it's balanced.

5633
03:45:56.479 --> 03:45:57.312
MATT: It's better.

5634
03:45:57.312 --> 03:45:58.744
MICA: It's better, right?

5635
03:45:58.744 --> 03:45:59.809
MATT: You want to give it a shot?

5636
03:45:59.809 --> 03:46:02.627
LAURA: I'm going to Blessing of the Trickster you as well,

5637
03:46:02.627 --> 03:46:04.930
so you can be even-- you can roll with advantage.

5638
03:46:04.930 --> 03:46:06.167
MATT: So you get advantage on your stealth checks,

5639
03:46:06.167 --> 03:46:07.772
so that is great.
MICA: Wonderful.

5640
03:46:07.772 --> 03:46:12.160
SAM: Caduceus, any blessings you want to do right now?

5641
03:46:12.160 --> 03:46:14.664
LAURA: It's only a--
TALIESIN: I cast Sober on Nott.

5642
03:46:14.664 --> 03:46:16.959
(laughter)

5643
03:46:16.959 --> 03:46:18.841
MATT: Yeah, the giant eagle does get a plus four--

5644
03:46:18.841 --> 03:46:20.071
or sorry, the giant owl gets plus four

5645
03:46:20.071 --> 03:46:21.365
to its stealth checks, which is nice.

5646
03:46:21.365 --> 03:46:23.298
MICA: So I get plus four and advantage.

5647
03:46:23.298 --> 03:46:24.131
MATT: Correct.

5648
03:46:24.131 --> 03:46:27.289
TALIESIN: At least for the next minute, you get--

5649
03:46:27.289 --> 03:46:31.171
add a d4 to any save, for like 60 seconds.

5650
03:46:31.171 --> 03:46:32.434
I don't have a long-term--

5651
03:46:32.434 --> 03:46:34.645
LAURA: It's only within 30 feet, Bless.

5652
03:46:34.645 --> 03:46:37.480
TALIESIN: Oh, actually, oh, I can do this
really quickly, can't I?

5653
03:46:37.480 --> 03:46:38.495
LAURA: But I can Bless us.

5654
03:46:38.495 --> 03:46:39.328
TALIESIN: Nope, everything's a minute,

5655
03:46:39.328 --> 03:46:40.670
I don't have anything that lasts longer than a minute.

5656
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:41.503
SAM: All right.

5657
03:46:41.503 --> 03:46:43.330
LAURA: I'm going to Bless us as we go up.

5658
03:46:43.330 --> 03:46:44.340
MATT: All right.

5659
03:46:44.340 --> 03:46:47.659
So the three of you, so we have currently,

5660
03:46:47.659 --> 03:46:51.255
we'll say the-- I'll use the giant eagle as an example.

5661
03:46:51.255 --> 03:46:52.596
TALIESIN: Three non-animals.

5662
03:46:52.596 --> 03:46:55.662
MATT: With Nott--
MARISHA: That's cool.

5663
03:46:55.662 --> 03:46:59.377
MATT: Jester, and Beau heading upward, right?

5664
03:46:59.377 --> 03:47:00.995
The rest of you are staying behind.

5665
03:47:00.995 --> 03:47:03.294
Caleb is staying in the dome, you guys are staying

5666
03:47:03.294 --> 03:47:05.941
at the bottom of the tunnel. Okay.

5667
03:47:05.941 --> 03:47:07.280
TALIESIN: All my Freedom of Movement.

5668
03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:09.036
MICA: Just a nice little girls' trip, you guys, it's fine.

5669
03:47:09.036 --> 03:47:10.791
MATT: Making your way upward through the tunnel,

5670
03:47:10.791 --> 03:47:13.119
I need you all to make-- well technically with this one,

5671
03:47:13.119 --> 03:47:14.686
I'd say you make a stealth check for all of you,

5672
03:47:14.686 --> 03:47:15.696
since they're on your back.

5673
03:47:15.696 --> 03:47:16.529
MICA: So with advantage.

5674
03:47:16.529 --> 03:47:18.287
MATT: With advantage, plus four to the roll.

5675
03:47:19.133 --> 03:47:20.953
SAM: Plus 10 for Pass Without--
MATT: Yep.

5676
03:47:20.953 --> 03:47:24.231
MICA: Okay, so that's 14 plus 10, 24.

5677
03:47:24.231 --> 03:47:25.237
LAURA: Plus four to the roll.

5678
03:47:25.237 --> 03:47:26.854
SAM: Plus a d4.
LAURA: A d4 to the roll.

5679
03:47:26.854 --> 03:47:29.579
MICA: Oh, shit, plus a d4, okay.

5680
03:47:29.579 --> 03:47:30.887
That's another one.

5681
03:47:30.887 --> 03:47:32.134
So that's 25.

5682
03:47:32.134 --> 03:47:32.967
MATT: 25.

5683
03:47:34.395 --> 03:47:35.228
Okay.

5684
03:47:35.228 --> 03:47:36.696
TALIESIN: (moans)

5685
03:47:36.696 --> 03:47:37.546
MATT: So.

5686
03:47:37.546 --> 03:47:40.145
SAM: What's the dragon's wisdom?
TRAVIS: Ancient.

5687
03:47:40.145 --> 03:47:43.008
MATT: You come up towards the top, reach the crest

5688
03:47:43.008 --> 03:47:46.732
of where the tunnel straightens out once more,

5689
03:47:46.732 --> 03:47:49.235
and there you can see what was once the ice wall,

5690
03:47:49.235 --> 03:47:51.934
but the center of it has been carved out and broken.

5691
03:47:51.934 --> 03:47:55.838
The dragon, without an issue, burrowed through,

5692
03:47:55.838 --> 03:47:59.327
it seemed, as part of its affinity

5693
03:47:59.327 --> 03:48:02.770
for the elements around it.

5694
03:48:02.770 --> 03:48:04.396
It pushed through without issue.

5695
03:48:04.396 --> 03:48:06.355
Now you see there's this opening where

5696
03:48:06.355 --> 03:48:09.237
within, you can actually see past the ice wall

5697
03:48:09.237 --> 03:48:11.324
into the lair.

5698
03:48:11.324 --> 03:48:14.042
Now the tunnel opens into a multi-tiered chamber

5699
03:48:14.042 --> 03:48:16.339
of extreme cold.

5700
03:48:16.339 --> 03:48:21.259
A weirdly heart-shaped chamber, oblong and strange,

5701
03:48:21.259 --> 03:48:24.364
entirely comprised of ice while massive, jagged icicles

5702
03:48:24.364 --> 03:48:27.962
jut from the ceiling like a field of Damocles' swords.

5703
03:48:27.962 --> 03:48:30.705
You can see the topography shifts and changes.

5704
03:48:30.705 --> 03:48:32.612
There is a center, almost like

5705
03:48:32.612 --> 03:48:35.293
an ice lake or puddle of some kind

5706
03:48:35.293 --> 03:48:38.534
frozen over in front of you,

5707
03:48:38.534 --> 03:48:40.509
and the weird topography

5708
03:48:40.509 --> 03:48:42.203
reminds you of a frightful playground

5709
03:48:42.203 --> 03:48:45.149
of jutting winter crystal.

5710
03:48:45.149 --> 03:48:46.632
If anyone wants to make a perception check

5711
03:48:46.632 --> 03:48:49.894
as they step and glance through the space.

5712
03:48:49.894 --> 03:48:50.769
TALIESIN: The heartbeat sound--

5713
03:48:50.769 --> 03:48:52.311
MICA: It's really--
LAURA: Feaking me out.

5714
03:48:52.311 --> 03:48:53.144
MICA: Yeah.

5715
03:48:55.810 --> 03:48:58.469
LAURA: 24 perception.

5716
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:59.841
MATT: All righty.

5717
03:48:59.841 --> 03:49:02.258
MICA: Where is my owl perception?

5718
03:49:06.081 --> 03:49:07.917
Ah, plus eight. Oh damn, owl.

5719
03:49:07.917 --> 03:49:09.288
MATT: Yeah, they're perceptive.

5720
03:49:09.288 --> 03:49:11.767
MICA: Thank god, that's a nine.

5721
03:49:11.767 --> 03:49:13.402
MATT: Okay.

5722
03:49:13.402 --> 03:49:15.442
Well, you glance past.

5723
03:49:15.442 --> 03:49:18.675
You can see in the far back chamber,

5724
03:49:18.675 --> 03:49:21.648
the large, white-scaled form of the dragon,

5725
03:49:21.648 --> 03:49:24.936
its wings folded in as it faces

5726
03:49:24.936 --> 03:49:26.660
loosely away and in the corner,

5727
03:49:26.660 --> 03:49:29.938
and it is-- one foot is up on this raised platform

5728
03:49:29.938 --> 03:49:32.281
with stone steps leading up to it.

5729
03:49:32.281 --> 03:49:34.334
The back half of it's sitting towards the edge

5730
03:49:34.334 --> 03:49:37.238
of that ice lake in the center, and it is

5731
03:49:37.238 --> 03:49:41.191
just chewing and biting through the cluster of ice.

5732
03:49:41.191 --> 03:49:43.668
LAURA: Does it seem like it noticed us at all?

5733
03:49:43.668 --> 03:49:45.475
MATT: It doesn't seem to have noticed your presence.

5734
03:49:45.475 --> 03:49:46.957
MICA: (exhaling)

5735
03:49:46.957 --> 03:49:49.171
MATT: You rolled higher than its passive perception.

5736
03:49:49.171 --> 03:49:50.251
SAM: Oh, nice.

5737
03:49:50.251 --> 03:49:51.750
MATT: 23, by the way.

5738
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:55.528
LAURA and MICA: (groaning)
(laughter)

5739
03:49:55.528 --> 03:49:56.863
MICA: I'm getting sweaty.

5740
03:49:56.863 --> 03:49:59.179
MATT: You also see within here,

5741
03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:02.612
not with the light,

5742
03:50:02.612 --> 03:50:04.192
but just through your darkvision,

5743
03:50:04.192 --> 03:50:06.968
amongst elements of the ice that surrounds the chamber,

5744
03:50:06.968 --> 03:50:10.735
you can see textures that catch your eye.

5745
03:50:12.489 --> 03:50:15.874
Like a faint shine of gold and silver,

5746
03:50:15.874 --> 03:50:18.608
bits of the treasure hoard embedded

5747
03:50:18.608 --> 03:50:20.858
in the ice walls around it.

5748
03:50:22.974 --> 03:50:27.203
Who knows what things are ensnared and locked

5749
03:50:27.203 --> 03:50:31.178
within the icy exterior of this lair.

5750
03:50:31.178 --> 03:50:34.587
You do also notice these very faint,

5751
03:50:34.587 --> 03:50:37.290
blue-purple lights that are like pulsing.

5752
03:50:37.290 --> 03:50:39.894
You see one in the far, far corner,

5753
03:50:39.894 --> 03:50:42.850
not too far from where Gelidon is.

5754
03:50:42.850 --> 03:50:46.477
You see a faint glow coming from a little alcove

5755
03:50:46.477 --> 03:50:47.445
that's off to the side.

5756
03:50:47.445 --> 03:50:48.609
Let me go ahead and show you, actually--

5757
03:50:48.609 --> 03:50:49.615
SAM: Oh boy!

5758
03:50:49.615 --> 03:50:53.026
MATT: You can see what you're dealing with.

5759
03:50:53.026 --> 03:50:54.509
SAM: I am so scared.

5760
03:50:54.509 --> 03:50:55.546
MARISHA: (laughing)

5761
03:50:55.546 --> 03:50:57.601
MICA: Are people known to like, get heart attacks

5762
03:50:57.601 --> 03:50:59.764
at the table and pass out, because I'm getting there.

5763
03:50:59.764 --> 03:51:01.600
TALIESIN: I'm seeing stars.

5764
03:51:01.600 --> 03:51:04.196
SAM: I want to remind you guys that all combats are

5765
03:51:04.196 --> 03:51:05.512
powered by Dwarven Forge.

5766
03:51:05.512 --> 03:51:08.370
Check them out at Dwarvenforge.com.

5767
03:51:08.370 --> 03:51:09.721
They sent me this helmet.

5768
03:51:09.721 --> 03:51:11.096
MICA: Holy fucking shit.

5769
03:51:11.096 --> 03:51:12.570
TALIESIN: Fuck.

5770
03:51:13.561 --> 03:51:15.743
SAM: Wow, that is such a fucking cool map.

5771
03:51:15.743 --> 03:51:17.393
TRAVIS: That is amazing.

5772
03:51:17.393 --> 03:51:18.912
MICA: Matt, did you make that?

5773
03:51:18.912 --> 03:51:20.039
ALL: (yelling)

5774
03:51:20.039 --> 03:51:21.541
TALIESIN: Oh no!

5775
03:51:21.541 --> 03:51:23.170
(laughter)

5776
03:51:23.170 --> 03:51:24.003
MICA: Oh no!

5777
03:51:24.003 --> 03:51:27.454
SAM: That is the biggest thing I've ever seen!

5778
03:51:27.454 --> 03:51:31.471
TRAVIS: Why, why are we doing this?!

5779
03:51:31.471 --> 03:51:32.620
Level nine!

5780
03:51:33.832 --> 03:51:36.153
TALIESIN: Because someone had a bad breakup.

5781
03:51:36.153 --> 03:51:37.819
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5782
03:51:37.819 --> 03:51:39.337
Yeah.

5783
03:51:39.337 --> 03:51:41.078
(groaning and laughing)

5784
03:51:41.078 --> 03:51:43.703
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5785
03:51:43.703 --> 03:51:46.742
MATT: Unnoticed here, the faint glow seems to be

5786
03:51:46.742 --> 03:51:49.681
coming from this end here.

5787
03:51:49.681 --> 03:51:50.932
LAURA: What?

5788
03:51:50.932 --> 03:51:52.787
MATT: And right off here.
LAURA: Okay, that's where the purple--

5789
03:51:52.787 --> 03:51:54.338
MATT: A weird pulsing purple glow.

5790
03:51:54.338 --> 03:51:56.274
MARISHA: Purple glow.

5791
03:51:56.274 --> 03:51:57.107
LAURA: Okay.

5792
03:51:57.107 --> 03:51:58.881
SAM: We need you guys.

5793
03:51:58.881 --> 03:52:00.562
TRAVIS: To do what?!

5794
03:52:00.562 --> 03:52:02.437
SAM: To catch us when we fall.

5795
03:52:02.437 --> 03:52:04.495
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

5796
03:52:04.495 --> 03:52:06.161
LAURA: Okay.

5797
03:52:06.161 --> 03:52:11.161
MARISHA: So wait, purple glows, but no sign of the blue?

5798
03:52:11.618 --> 03:52:13.100
Of the mithral?

5799
03:52:13.100 --> 03:52:16.033
MATT: You don't have a visual point on it.

5800
03:52:16.033 --> 03:52:17.039
A bead.

5801
03:52:17.039 --> 03:52:20.740
SAM: Does it look from the back that it's still eating, or--?

5802
03:52:20.740 --> 03:52:22.677
MATT: It looks like it's (snarling).

5803
03:52:22.677 --> 03:52:23.635
SAM: It's with the thing.

5804
03:52:23.635 --> 03:52:25.159
MATT: Like, the distance it's at, you can just barely

5805
03:52:25.159 --> 03:52:26.327
make out the shape with your darkvision, and

5806
03:52:26.327 --> 03:52:28.022
it's right on the cusp, and there's no light

5807
03:52:28.022 --> 03:52:29.563
in this chamber, it is pitch black.

5808
03:52:29.563 --> 03:52:32.305
SAM: We have to hide, we have to hide right now.

5809
03:52:32.305 --> 03:52:33.657
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're going to have to go invisible,

5810
03:52:33.657 --> 03:52:35.054
draw him out, run around.

5811
03:52:35.054 --> 03:52:37.901
MATT: Yeah. Beau sees nothing, it is just black.

5812
03:52:37.901 --> 03:52:41.257
MARISHA: I've got my goggles.
MATT: Oh, you have your goggles, nevermind, sorry.

5813
03:52:41.257 --> 03:52:43.700
I'm used to human, sorry.

5814
03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:44.690
You're right.

5815
03:52:44.690 --> 03:52:46.898
SAM: Let's go hide.
MATT: That's my bad.

5816
03:52:46.898 --> 03:52:49.183
LAURA: Beau, can I have the stone?
SAM: Hide. She's invisible.

5817
03:52:49.183 --> 03:52:51.255
MICA: Wait, am I still flying or have I landed?

5818
03:52:51.255 --> 03:52:52.589
MATT: You've landed.
MICA: Okay.

5819
03:52:52.589 --> 03:52:53.571
SAM: Oh wait, you're not invisible,

5820
03:52:53.571 --> 03:52:55.750
you attacked with your shuriken.

5821
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:56.641
MATT: You did.

5822
03:52:56.641 --> 03:52:58.765
LAURA: So you're not invisible anymore.

5823
03:52:58.765 --> 03:52:59.598
Okay.

5824
03:52:59.598 --> 03:53:00.803
SAM: But I can make you invisible.

5825
03:53:00.803 --> 03:53:02.602
LAURA: Well--

5826
03:53:02.602 --> 03:53:03.920
Okay.

5827
03:53:03.920 --> 03:53:05.271
SAM: Who needs to be invisible?

5828
03:53:05.271 --> 03:53:06.115
TRAVIS: (laughs)

5829
03:53:06.115 --> 03:53:08.493
MARISHA: I'm fine, I'll be great.
TRAVIS: We're great.

5830
03:53:08.493 --> 03:53:10.693
SAM: Let's go over there and hide.

5831
03:53:10.693 --> 03:53:13.897
LAURA: We're going to hide behind this.

5832
03:53:13.897 --> 03:53:15.261
MARISHA: It's a lot to do.

5833
03:53:15.261 --> 03:53:17.175
TALIESIN: It is, it's two iPads.

5834
03:53:17.175 --> 03:53:19.460
SAM: Are you going drop your form or are you going to--

5835
03:53:19.460 --> 03:53:21.200
LAURA: Are all of us going to go fucking in,

5836
03:53:21.200 --> 03:53:22.359
or is it just like--

5837
03:53:22.359 --> 03:53:24.471
SAM: We just need somewhere to hide for now

5838
03:53:24.471 --> 03:53:25.894
and then we can figure it out.

5839
03:53:25.894 --> 03:53:28.301
LAURA: Just, like you and me can go try to sneak in

5840
03:53:28.301 --> 03:53:29.747
and I can Dimension Door us out.

5841
03:53:29.747 --> 03:53:31.830
I can't Dimension Door four people out.

5842
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:34.013
SAM: Well, you can Dimension Door us in and out.

5843
03:53:34.013 --> 03:53:37.377
Yeah, I could, I could Dimension Door--
MARISHA: But we don't know where it is.

5844
03:53:37.377 --> 03:53:40.440
LAURA: We would see it glow, because it's pitch dark in here,

5845
03:53:40.440 --> 03:53:41.284
so we could see--

5846
03:53:41.284 --> 03:53:43.600
MARISHA: -- down the tunnel at any place.

5847
03:53:43.600 --> 03:53:46.425
LAURA: If we peek our head in,

5848
03:53:47.441 --> 03:53:49.695
can we see a faint blue glow

5849
03:53:49.695 --> 03:53:52.154
from within this cavern anywhere?

5850
03:53:52.154 --> 03:53:55.119
MATT: From your perspective there?

5851
03:53:55.119 --> 03:53:56.623
Make another perception check for me.

5852
03:53:56.623 --> 03:53:58.904
SAM: I'm going to be next to Jester,
if I can get over there

5853
03:53:58.904 --> 03:54:01.083
without the dragon seeing.

5854
03:54:01.083 --> 03:54:03.654
MATT: You guys-- I'll let you get up to there

5855
03:54:03.654 --> 03:54:05.846
with your same stealth check.

5856
03:54:05.846 --> 03:54:06.701
SAM: That's cocked.

5857
03:54:06.701 --> 03:54:08.488
TALIESIN: That's so weird.
LAURA: That was horrible.

5858
03:54:08.488 --> 03:54:09.747
TRAVIS: There's one.

5859
03:54:09.747 --> 03:54:12.678
(groaning)

5860
03:54:12.678 --> 03:54:15.052
LAURA: One, it was almost 19 and it's a one.

5861
03:54:15.052 --> 03:54:18.218
MATT: There is no sign of the blue glow

5862
03:54:18.218 --> 03:54:20.743
from this perspective, unfortunately.

5863
03:54:22.722 --> 03:54:27.722
MICA: I have a huge darkvision,
I have 120 feet of darkvision.

5864
03:54:27.930 --> 03:54:29.554
MATT: You have 120 feet.
MICA: Yeah.

5865
03:54:29.554 --> 03:54:31.012
Do I see anything?

5866
03:54:31.012 --> 03:54:32.971
Do I see a faint blue glow anywhere?

5867
03:54:32.971 --> 03:54:34.581
MATT: Not from this point.

5868
03:54:34.581 --> 03:54:36.105
Actually, if you want to make a perception check,

5869
03:54:36.105 --> 03:54:37.310
are you still in eagle form?

5870
03:54:37.310 --> 03:54:38.629
MICA: I'm still in my owl form.

5871
03:54:38.629 --> 03:54:39.487
MATT: I'm sorry, owl form, you can go ahead

5872
03:54:39.487 --> 03:54:41.683
and roll perception from your owl.

5873
03:54:41.683 --> 03:54:43.646
SAM: They might have advantage on perception checks

5874
03:54:43.646 --> 03:54:45.109
or something, they're owls.

5875
03:54:45.109 --> 03:54:46.161
MICA: 16.

5876
03:54:46.161 --> 03:54:47.443
LAURA: Keen hearing.

5877
03:54:47.443 --> 03:54:49.102
Oh, keen hearing and sight.

5878
03:54:49.102 --> 03:54:50.285
Advantage.
MICA: Oh, I have advantage!

5879
03:54:50.285 --> 03:54:51.118
SAM: Yeah.

5880
03:54:52.883 --> 03:54:54.200
MICA: That's better! What's 14 plus eight?

5881
03:54:54.200 --> 03:54:55.321
MATT: The owl has darkvision of 120 feet?

5882
03:54:55.321 --> 03:54:57.615
MICA: Yeah. 22 plus my 120 feet of darkvision.

5883
03:54:57.615 --> 03:55:00.255
MATT: You see right in front of it, in the midst

5884
03:55:00.255 --> 03:55:03.426
of this chaos there is a faint bit of blue glow

5885
03:55:03.426 --> 03:55:06.550
of the imbued iceflex mithral,

5886
03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:09.789
covered in chunks of broken ice and crushed ice,

5887
03:55:09.789 --> 03:55:13.917
all emanating. You can see bits and pieces of the spider.

5888
03:55:13.917 --> 03:55:16.867
Unfortunately, as usual with some of these spells,

5889
03:55:16.867 --> 03:55:20.201
the fey creatures are, upon death,

5890
03:55:20.201 --> 03:55:22.094
reverted back to wherever you pulled them from.

5891
03:55:22.094 --> 03:55:23.468
MICA: Ah.

5892
03:55:23.468 --> 03:55:24.546
MATT: The spider is--

5893
03:55:24.546 --> 03:55:27.117
Or this doesn't summon fey creatures, this is--

5894
03:55:27.117 --> 03:55:28.373
MICA: No, it was a fey creature.

5895
03:55:28.373 --> 03:55:29.440
MATT: That's right, because it's Woodland Beings.

5896
03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:32.406
MICA: Yeah.
MATT: So yeah, so the ice is being eaten,

5897
03:55:32.406 --> 03:55:33.440
but there is no spider.

5898
03:55:33.440 --> 03:55:34.385
MICA: Ha, fuck you, dragon.

5899
03:55:34.385 --> 03:55:36.596
MATT: The dragon seems very unhappy with that circumstance.

5900
03:55:36.596 --> 03:55:37.499
MICA: I am sorry, Mr. Dragon.

5901
03:55:37.499 --> 03:55:38.826
MATT: Agitated and trying desperately

5902
03:55:38.826 --> 03:55:41.184
to chew through the ice to find the meat of its meal,

5903
03:55:41.184 --> 03:55:42.948
of which there is none.

5904
03:55:42.948 --> 03:55:47.948
MARISHA: Why don't Reani and I act as the distraction?

5905
03:55:48.441 --> 03:55:53.439
We bolt out while you guys go grab it.

5906
03:55:53.439 --> 03:55:54.343
SAM: Yeah, yeah yeah.
MARISHA: And then go.

5907
03:55:54.343 --> 03:55:55.845
SAM and LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5908
03:55:55.845 --> 03:55:56.686
MARISHA: Okay.

5909
03:55:56.686 --> 03:55:58.448
MICA: So I nod with my owl head.

5910
03:55:59.448 --> 03:56:01.380
LAURA: Actually, get down to the bottom,

5911
03:56:01.380 --> 03:56:03.669
make noise at the bottom of the tunnel.

5912
03:56:03.669 --> 03:56:04.810
MARISHA: Okay.

5913
03:56:04.810 --> 03:56:06.756
SAM: Well--
TALIESIN: How are we going to--

5914
03:56:06.756 --> 03:56:10.105
SAM: You can flap your, yeah, make a sound

5915
03:56:10.105 --> 03:56:12.239
and then just dart down on the owl.

5916
03:56:12.239 --> 03:56:14.526
MICA: So I can't speak as an owl, can I?

5917
03:56:14.526 --> 03:56:16.702
MATT: No.
MICA: So I want to just hold out my claw

5918
03:56:16.702 --> 03:56:19.795
to summon like, get in it.

5919
03:56:19.795 --> 03:56:20.854
Get in it.

5920
03:56:20.854 --> 03:56:22.344
LAURA: We hide, we're going to hide.

5921
03:56:22.344 --> 03:56:23.460
SAM: Super hide.

5922
03:56:23.460 --> 03:56:25.212
LAURA: Can you make both of us invisible?

5923
03:56:25.212 --> 03:56:26.680
SAM: Can I make boulders invisible?

5924
03:56:26.680 --> 03:56:28.967
LAURA: Both of us.
SAM: No.

5925
03:56:28.967 --> 03:56:30.247
SAM: Boners invisible?

5926
03:56:30.247 --> 03:56:32.768
LAURA: We're going to hide as much as we can over here.

5927
03:56:32.768 --> 03:56:34.476
SAM: I can make one of us invisible.

5928
03:56:34.476 --> 03:56:37.155
LAURA: Can I Blessing of the Trickster myself?

5929
03:56:37.155 --> 03:56:39.153
I'm not sure if I can.

5930
03:56:39.153 --> 03:56:41.268
"A willing creature other than yourself," nope.

5931
03:56:41.268 --> 03:56:42.495
MATT: Yeah.

5932
03:56:42.495 --> 03:56:43.975
LAURA: Can you make me invisible?

5933
03:56:43.975 --> 03:56:44.808
SAM: Yeah.

5934
03:56:44.808 --> 03:56:46.772
LAURA: Then you have advantage on stealth.

5935
03:56:46.772 --> 03:56:49.876
SAM: I boop her on the nose and turn her invisible.

5936
03:56:49.876 --> 03:56:51.114
LAURA: Then I'm going to--

5937
03:56:51.114 --> 03:56:52.489
MATT: So this is your second Channel Divinity you've used.

5938
03:56:52.489 --> 03:56:53.398
You have no more--
LAURA: No no,

5939
03:56:53.398 --> 03:56:55.067
I didn't actually do Blessing of the Trickster,

5940
03:56:55.067 --> 03:56:56.798
I didn't need to, because she already has--

5941
03:56:56.798 --> 03:56:57.816
MATT: Oh, gotcha.

5942
03:56:57.816 --> 03:56:59.066
LAURA: Before you do that, I'm going to

5943
03:56:59.066 --> 03:57:00.107
Pass Without a Trace us

5944
03:57:00.107 --> 03:57:03.410
so that we have higher, and then you can be invisible.

5945
03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:05.521
MATT: Okay, you cast Pass Without a Trace again.

5946
03:57:05.521 --> 03:57:09.028
MICA: Did anybody give me that, I can go however far I want,

5947
03:57:09.028 --> 03:57:11.011
however fast I want?

5948
03:57:11.011 --> 03:57:13.042
What was that, no?

5949
03:57:13.042 --> 03:57:15.704
TALIESIN: I only had three, and it's less far and how fast,

5950
03:57:15.704 --> 03:57:18.405
it's just if you try and get caught--

5951
03:57:18.405 --> 03:57:20.037
MATT: Grappled.
MICA: Oh.

5952
03:57:20.037 --> 03:57:21.496
TALIESIN: It doesn't make you faster.

5953
03:57:21.496 --> 03:57:26.299
MICA: Question, if I as an owl wanted to bolt,

5954
03:57:26.299 --> 03:57:28.684
could I just bolt?

5955
03:57:28.684 --> 03:57:29.623
MARISHA: Freedom of Movement?

5956
03:57:29.623 --> 03:57:30.738
MATT: I mean, if you--

5957
03:57:30.738 --> 03:57:33.146
MICA: Like if I bolted out of the cavern and like,

5958
03:57:33.146 --> 03:57:34.730
through the tunnel.

5959
03:57:34.730 --> 03:57:36.367
LAURA: Yeah, you could do that.

5960
03:57:36.367 --> 03:57:37.425
MICA: Yeah? Cool.

5961
03:57:37.425 --> 03:57:38.980
MATT: At your owl speed, yeah.

5962
03:57:38.980 --> 03:57:41.272
MICA: At my owl speed?
MARISHA: How fast is your owl speed?

5963
03:57:41.272 --> 03:57:43.412
MICA: Can owl out-speed a dragon?
MATT: I don't know.

5964
03:57:43.412 --> 03:57:44.743
LAURA: That's why I feel like you should make noise

5965
03:57:44.743 --> 03:57:46.942
at the bottom of the tunnel.

5966
03:57:46.942 --> 03:57:48.400
MARISHA: How fast, what's your owl speed?

5967
03:57:48.400 --> 03:57:50.909
MICA: Five feet, and I fly 60 feet.

5968
03:57:50.909 --> 03:57:52.830
MARISHA: Okay. Fly 60 feet.

5969
03:57:52.830 --> 03:57:56.551
TRAVIS: You could do 120 if you did your action--
MARISHA: In a round.

5970
03:57:56.551 --> 03:58:01.071
So we're going to take off, and then I'll do the thing,

5971
03:58:01.071 --> 03:58:03.625
once we get momentum going.

5972
03:58:03.625 --> 03:58:06.967
But I want to wait for you guys to get in place.

5973
03:58:06.967 --> 03:58:08.614
LAURA: Okay.

5974
03:58:08.614 --> 03:58:10.757
TRAVIS: For the record, I don't think
you can outfly a dragon,

5975
03:58:10.757 --> 03:58:12.717
but we're going to fucking find out.

5976
03:58:12.717 --> 03:58:14.099
MARISHA: Get a head start.

5977
03:58:14.099 --> 03:58:15.637
MICA: I'm going to get a head start.

5978
03:58:15.637 --> 03:58:20.481
So to recap, I'm going to lift off the ground,

5979
03:58:20.481 --> 03:58:21.723
you're going to make a noise,

5980
03:58:21.723 --> 03:58:23.442
and then I'm going to fucking go.

5981
03:58:23.442 --> 03:58:26.411
MARISHA: Yeah, you just go, and I'll time it.

5982
03:58:26.411 --> 03:58:27.989
LAURA: Me and Nott are hiding, hiding, hiding.

5983
03:58:27.989 --> 03:58:28.822
MICA: Okay.

5984
03:58:28.822 --> 03:58:30.224
SAM: But we're super hiding.

5985
03:58:30.224 --> 03:58:31.662
MATT: Go ahead and roll stealth checks

5986
03:58:31.662 --> 03:58:33.217
with your additional hiding benefits,

5987
03:58:33.217 --> 03:58:34.671
since you guys are now moved behind in position.

5988
03:58:34.671 --> 03:58:36.604
You're attempting to hunker down

5989
03:58:36.604 --> 03:58:39.616
and not be perceived by this entity.

5990
03:58:39.616 --> 03:58:41.943
SAM: This is a check, I just do a straight roll.

5991
03:58:41.943 --> 03:58:42.776
MATT: Exactly.

5992
03:58:42.776 --> 03:58:45.233
SAM: Oh, terrible.

5993
03:58:45.233 --> 03:58:46.405
LAURA: Advantage.

5994
03:58:46.405 --> 03:58:48.893
SAM: No, no, no advantage.

5995
03:58:48.893 --> 03:58:50.039
I'm drunk.

5996
03:58:50.039 --> 03:58:53.286
So 18 plus Pass Without a Trace, 28.

5997
03:58:53.286 --> 03:58:55.960
LAURA: 29.
MATT: 29, okay.

5998
03:58:55.960 --> 03:58:57.696
TRAVIS: That's not terrible.
MATT: So you guys are

5999
03:58:57.696 --> 03:58:58.821
hiding in position.

6000
03:58:58.821 --> 03:58:59.862
MICA: Okay.

6001
03:58:59.862 --> 03:59:01.065
MATT: And what are you doing?
LAURA: And I'm invisible.

6002
03:59:01.065 --> 03:59:01.898
MATT: And you're invisible.

6003
03:59:01.898 --> 03:59:04.357
MICA: So I'm holding Beau, and gently--

6004
03:59:04.357 --> 03:59:08.998
MARISHA: And I pull out my

6005
03:59:08.998 --> 03:59:10.074
bottle rockets.

6006
03:59:10.074 --> 03:59:10.907
SAM: Yes!

6007
03:59:10.907 --> 03:59:13.640
MARISHA: My firecrackers.
MATT: The Hupperdook firecrackers, okay.

6008
03:59:13.640 --> 03:59:15.810
MARISHA: And I hold up a match.

6009
03:59:15.810 --> 03:59:17.704
MICA: I gently lift off the ground,

6010
03:59:17.704 --> 03:59:20.752
and before anything happens, I just like,

6011
03:59:20.752 --> 03:59:23.767
nuzzle Beau in hopes that we're not going to die.

6012
03:59:23.767 --> 03:59:26.266
MARISHA: I nuzzle her back, and while I nuzzle her back,

6013
03:59:26.266 --> 03:59:27.382
I think:

6014
03:59:27.382 --> 03:59:29.448
Fuck you, Professor Thaddeus.

6015
03:59:29.448 --> 03:59:31.787
(laughter)

6016
03:59:31.787 --> 03:59:33.951
MICA: I guess that's sweet.

6017
03:59:33.951 --> 03:59:35.438
(laughter)

6018
03:59:35.438 --> 03:59:36.974
MATT and MICA: All right.

6019
03:59:37.957 --> 03:59:40.040
MICA: And I gave a small nod.

6020
03:59:41.019 --> 03:59:45.306
MARISHA: As we take flight, I light the firecracker.

6021
03:59:45.306 --> 03:59:47.479
MICA: And I'm heading down there.

6022
03:59:47.479 --> 03:59:49.312
MARISHA: And I wait and wait.

6023
03:59:50.801 --> 03:59:52.754
MATT: (firecrackers popping)

6024
03:59:52.754 --> 03:59:55.789
You guys, from down there, hear the series of explosions.

6025
03:59:55.789 --> 03:59:59.783
Suddenly from behind, (growling).

6026
03:59:59.783 --> 04:00:01.854
Suddenly the dragon turns around,

6027
04:00:01.854 --> 04:00:05.978
the wings beat up and jumps and leaps, spinning

6028
04:00:05.978 --> 04:00:09.194
(shouting)

6029
04:00:09.194 --> 04:00:11.515
in an area as you guys dart down, (whooshing)

6030
04:00:11.515 --> 04:00:14.636
you hear it slam into the frozen wall behind you

6031
04:00:14.636 --> 04:00:16.191
and dive after you.

6032
04:00:16.191 --> 04:00:19.530
Its fly speed is 80 feet, and it is gaining.

6033
04:00:19.530 --> 04:00:21.243
MICA: I want to go into the hut,

6034
04:00:21.243 --> 04:00:22.854
because the hut can protect me from everything, right?

6035
04:00:22.854 --> 04:00:25.216
MATT: All right, so, at double speed, for your turn,

6036
04:00:25.216 --> 04:00:27.993
that puts you at, sorry, 60 speed?

6037
04:00:27.993 --> 04:00:29.155
So 120 feet.

6038
04:00:29.155 --> 04:00:31.649
So you get over the edge to the bottom tunnel

6039
04:00:31.649 --> 04:00:34.637
and about 40 feet inward, so you're down close

6040
04:00:34.637 --> 04:00:35.914
to where you guys were hiding before.

6041
04:00:35.914 --> 04:00:36.747
MICA: Okay.

6042
04:00:36.747 --> 04:00:38.649
MATT: The dragon comes through
from the whole distance there,

6043
04:00:38.649 --> 04:00:40.058
trying to catch up with you.

6044
04:00:40.058 --> 04:00:41.897
It gets down and lands on the bottom.

6045
04:00:41.897 --> 04:00:43.883
MICA: Okay. Right.

6046
04:00:43.883 --> 04:00:47.511
MATT: As it slams down, I'd say, yeah, because it drops.

6047
04:00:47.511 --> 04:00:49.676
It doesn't even try and fly, it just falls.

6048
04:00:49.676 --> 04:00:51.918
Hits there. (deep inhale)

6049
04:00:51.918 --> 04:00:53.284
MARISHA: Oh god.
MATT: He's going to take a

6050
04:00:53.284 --> 04:00:58.201
deep breath and blow outward.

6051
04:00:59.171 --> 04:01:00.740
At 40 feet out from it on the ground,

6052
04:01:00.740 --> 04:01:03.170
it will catch you in its breath.

6053
04:01:03.170 --> 04:01:05.711
I need constitution saving throws

6054
04:01:05.711 --> 04:01:07.389
from all three of you, please.

6055
04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:08.393
SAM and LAURA: All three?

6056
04:01:08.393 --> 04:01:12.147
MATT: Or sorry, just the two of you, sorry, sorry, my bad.

6057
04:01:12.147 --> 04:01:13.764
They're fine, you're fine.

6058
04:01:13.764 --> 04:01:14.819
LAURA: (pretend sobbing)

6059
04:01:14.819 --> 04:01:16.477
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

6060
04:01:20.522 --> 04:01:21.617
SAM: Don't you have some bonuses?

6061
04:01:21.617 --> 04:01:23.880
MARISHA: Oh yeah, do I have a bonus, Bless?

6062
04:01:23.880 --> 04:01:25.777
TALIESIN: I didn't Bless, did you Bless?

6063
04:01:25.777 --> 04:01:28.254
LAURA: I Blessed us.
MARISHA: You blessed, right?

6064
04:01:28.254 --> 04:01:29.712
MATT: You cast Pass Without a Trace, though.

6065
04:01:29.712 --> 04:01:30.545
LAURA: I did.

6066
04:01:30.545 --> 04:01:32.202
Sorry.
MARISHA: 11.

6067
04:01:32.202 --> 04:01:34.158
MICA: I'm going to use my Luck and I'm going to roll again.

6068
04:01:34.158 --> 04:01:35.112
MATT: Go for it.

6069
04:01:35.112 --> 04:01:37.112
MICA: Because fuck that one.

6070
04:01:38.938 --> 04:01:42.452
Oh thank god, oh, I'm an owl, though, right?

6071
04:01:42.452 --> 04:01:44.231
Okay, so that's--

6072
04:01:44.231 --> 04:01:46.763
MATT: Good luck, because he's rolling shitty so far.

6073
04:01:46.763 --> 04:01:51.689
MICA: That is, and you said constitution, that's just a 13.

6074
04:01:51.689 --> 04:01:56.689
MATT: That is 61 points of cold damage to each of you.

6075
04:01:57.288 --> 04:01:59.679
MICA: I turn back into Reani.

6076
04:01:59.679 --> 04:02:01.619
MARISHA: No, it's a dex save.
MICA: Oh fuck.

6077
04:02:01.619 --> 04:02:03.398
MATT: You turn back to to Reani.
MICA: Yeah.

6078
04:02:03.398 --> 04:02:04.231
MATT: Okay.

6079
04:02:04.231 --> 04:02:06.529
LAURA: But you're already at the bottom at that point.

6080
04:02:06.529 --> 04:02:07.696
MARISHA: 67?

6081
04:02:07.696 --> 04:02:09.767
MATT: 61 points of cold damage I think, is that right?

6082
04:02:09.767 --> 04:02:10.783
LAURA: 61, yeah.

6083
04:02:10.783 --> 04:02:12.967
MATT: So you get 61, and so any leftover damage

6084
04:02:12.967 --> 04:02:15.545
goes to you in Reani form.

6085
04:02:15.545 --> 04:02:18.775
MICA: Okay, so 61 minus 19 is what?

6086
04:02:18.775 --> 04:02:21.025
TALIESIN: Um, 51--

6087
04:02:23.095 --> 04:02:24.995
It's 42?

6088
04:02:24.995 --> 04:02:25.828
SAM: 42.

6089
04:02:25.828 --> 04:02:27.482
TRAVIS: Siri, what's 61 minus--

6090
04:02:27.482 --> 04:02:28.876
MATT: So you take 42 points of cold damage,.

6091
04:02:28.876 --> 04:02:30.595
MICA: I'm still up, I'm still up.

6092
04:02:30.595 --> 04:02:33.890
MATT: Okay.
MICA: Jesus Christ, I'm still up.

6093
04:02:33.890 --> 04:02:34.961
Ha!

6094
04:02:34.961 --> 04:02:37.394
LAURA: The minute the dragon passed us,

6095
04:02:37.394 --> 04:02:40.731
I'm Dimension Dooring me and Nott to the other side--

6096
04:02:40.731 --> 04:02:41.920
MARISHA: Get it, get it, get it.

6097
04:02:41.920 --> 04:02:43.980
LAURA: -- of the cavern.

6098
04:02:43.980 --> 04:02:46.387
MATT: You guys leap over to where it was.

6099
04:02:46.387 --> 04:02:48.182
SAM: What do we see? Is it in ice, or--

6100
04:02:48.182 --> 04:02:49.080
LAURA: Can we see the mithral?

6101
04:02:49.080 --> 04:02:50.614
MATT: You can see the faint blue glow.

6102
04:02:50.614 --> 04:02:52.525
You have to rummage through to get to it,

6103
04:02:52.525 --> 04:02:54.675
but you can see it, you both reach out, grab it.

6104
04:02:54.675 --> 04:02:56.124
It still has a bit of ice around it.

6105
04:02:56.124 --> 04:02:57.330
Freezes your fingers to the touch,

6106
04:02:57.330 --> 04:02:59.618
it hurts, it burns to grab--
LAURA: I'm resistant.

6107
04:02:59.618 --> 04:03:01.558
MATT: So you grab it and like (groans).

6108
04:03:01.558 --> 04:03:03.295
It burns the skin, but it's fine, it's fine,

6109
04:03:03.295 --> 04:03:05.447
you can deal with this, so you take half damage

6110
04:03:05.447 --> 04:03:06.954
of the frost on it. Double ones.

6111
04:03:06.954 --> 04:03:08.283
You take one point of cold damage

6112
04:03:08.283 --> 04:03:11.437
as you grab the frozen iceflex mithral.

6113
04:03:11.437 --> 04:03:12.270
LAURA: Okay.

6114
04:03:12.270 --> 04:03:13.604
SAM: I'm just going to quickly look around.

6115
04:03:13.604 --> 04:03:14.922
MATT: Make a perception check.

6116
04:03:14.922 --> 04:03:16.170
(laughter)

6117
04:03:16.170 --> 04:03:17.113
SAM: Just four.

6118
04:03:17.113 --> 04:03:17.946
MATT: Just four?

6119
04:03:17.946 --> 04:03:21.959
I mean, easy to see, all of these is just

6120
04:03:21.959 --> 04:03:24.384
piles of gold and silver and platinum,

6121
04:03:24.384 --> 04:03:27.093
you can see chain mail glowing, you can see weapons,

6122
04:03:27.093 --> 04:03:29.889
this is a dragon's hoard that is half frozen

6123
04:03:29.889 --> 04:03:34.400
and half exposed or covered in snow and slush.

6124
04:03:34.400 --> 04:03:36.334
All around you, everywhere you look

6125
04:03:36.334 --> 04:03:37.526
in this moment of clarity--

6126
04:03:37.526 --> 04:03:39.112
LAURA: You want to take your action and grab something

6127
04:03:39.112 --> 04:03:41.503
and then we will bamf, but do it--

6128
04:03:41.503 --> 04:03:44.330
SAM: Do I get a movement and action?

6129
04:03:44.330 --> 04:03:45.269
MATT: If you want it.

6130
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:46.474
(laughter)

6131
04:03:46.474 --> 04:03:50.368
SAM: I will move, grab one thing and run back to her.

6132
04:03:50.368 --> 04:03:51.526
MATT: Okay. Okay.

6133
04:03:51.526 --> 04:03:54.179
SAM: Move, grab the first shiny thing that's exposed.

6134
04:03:54.179 --> 04:03:58.096
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Whatever it may be.

6135
04:03:58.096 --> 04:03:58.977
MATT: Okay.

6136
04:03:58.977 --> 04:04:00.122
SAM: And run back to her.

6137
04:04:00.122 --> 04:04:03.259
MATT: You reach and grab in a pile and pull out

6138
04:04:03.259 --> 04:04:05.658
a rainbow-colored stone

6139
04:04:05.658 --> 04:04:07.558
that has layers of color to it.

6140
04:04:07.558 --> 04:04:09.420
You look at it briefly and the colors

6141
04:04:09.420 --> 04:04:12.295
shift slightly, and you rush back.

6142
04:04:12.295 --> 04:04:14.232
SAM: Pretty good.

6143
04:04:14.232 --> 04:04:15.878
LAURA: Can I use another action?

6144
04:04:15.878 --> 04:04:16.711
MATT: Yeah.

6145
04:04:16.711 --> 04:04:19.414
LAURA: I'm going to Dimension Door us again.

6146
04:04:19.414 --> 04:04:20.523
MATT: Oh, that's right, you can't,

6147
04:04:20.523 --> 04:04:21.728
you used one action this turn to rummage through

6148
04:04:21.728 --> 04:04:23.299
and find the mithral, so you can't do it this turn.

6149
04:04:23.299 --> 04:04:24.423
LAURA: Okay.

6150
04:04:24.423 --> 04:04:26.218
SAM: Yeah, we also Dimension Doored over here.

6151
04:04:26.218 --> 04:04:28.006
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I'm sitting.

6152
04:04:28.006 --> 04:04:30.882
MATT: Okay, if you Dimension Doored over with your action,

6153
04:04:30.882 --> 04:04:32.287
I'll say technically you're still rummaging through

6154
04:04:32.287 --> 04:04:34.484
to get the mithral, you're just now pulling it out, okay.

6155
04:04:34.484 --> 04:04:36.409
LAURA: As you ran over and got shiny thing,

6156
04:04:36.409 --> 04:04:38.444
I got the mithral, okay, okay.

6157
04:04:38.444 --> 04:04:40.926
MATT: So now, your guys' turn.

6158
04:04:40.926 --> 04:04:44.428
MARISHA and MICA: Hut, hut.

6159
04:04:44.428 --> 04:04:45.465
LAURA: Can you book it?

6160
04:04:45.465 --> 04:04:47.878
MICA: No, I'm going to Wild Shape into an ice spider queen.

6161
04:04:47.878 --> 04:04:48.770
MARISHA: The hut, get to the hut.

6162
04:04:48.770 --> 04:04:50.085
MATT: You're going to Wild Shape into an ice spider queen?

6163
04:04:50.085 --> 04:04:51.556
MICA: I'm going to Wild Shape into an ice spider queen.

6164
04:04:51.556 --> 04:04:54.317
MATT: All right, is it a bonus action for you,

6165
04:04:54.317 --> 04:04:55.532
because you're Circle of the Moon?

6166
04:04:55.532 --> 04:04:57.567
MICA: Yes, it's a bonus action.
MATT: Yes, you do, bonus action.

6167
04:04:57.567 --> 04:05:00.600
MATT: You watch as Reani turns into a replica

6168
04:05:00.600 --> 04:05:03.722
of the ice spider queen in front of you. You are--

6169
04:05:03.722 --> 04:05:06.307
MICA: How far away is the hut?

6170
04:05:06.307 --> 04:05:07.798
MATT: You're 40 feet in, you guys put that

6171
04:05:07.798 --> 04:05:09.832
about 145 feet back, right?

6172
04:05:09.832 --> 04:05:11.803
MICA: Fuck us in the ass for that.

6173
04:05:11.803 --> 04:05:14.322
MATT: So you have about 100 feet to get to that.

6174
04:05:14.322 --> 04:05:15.343
TALIESIN: But you can double speed.

6175
04:05:15.343 --> 04:05:17.475
MATT: 95, 90 feet to get to the dome,

6176
04:05:17.475 --> 04:05:18.460
because it's a 10-foot radius.

6177
04:05:18.460 --> 04:05:21.390
MICA: So is that only 60 for me? If I double it?

6178
04:05:21.390 --> 04:05:22.488
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're 60 feet.

6179
04:05:22.488 --> 04:05:23.720
MICA: God mother fuck.

6180
04:05:23.720 --> 04:05:25.310
MARISHA: I'm going to jump off the spider.

6181
04:05:25.310 --> 04:05:26.626
MATT: Uh-huh.
MARISHA: And run.

6182
04:05:26.626 --> 04:05:27.816
MATT: Okay.

6183
04:05:27.816 --> 04:05:30.931
So you run a distance of, your speed is 45?

6184
04:05:30.931 --> 04:05:31.992
MARISHA: 90 feet.

6185
04:05:31.992 --> 04:05:33.552
MATT: So 90 feet, double action.

6186
04:05:33.552 --> 04:05:35.243
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Okay.

6187
04:05:35.243 --> 04:05:39.651
So that's your, so yeah, you can make it

6188
04:05:39.651 --> 04:05:41.429
just into the dome from here.

6189
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:43.029
TRAVIS: I'm like--

6190
04:05:43.029 --> 04:05:43.877
SAM: Are you in the dome?

6191
04:05:43.877 --> 04:05:46.516
TRAVIS: Yeah, Caduceus and I are, yeah.

6192
04:05:46.516 --> 04:05:49.106
TALIESIN: I'm going to be just hanging by the door,

6193
04:05:49.106 --> 04:05:51.213
seeing if I need to help anybody.

6194
04:05:51.213 --> 04:05:52.085
MATT: Okay.

6195
04:05:52.085 --> 04:05:54.465
TALIESIN: I'm inside, but like--
MATT: Yeah.

6196
04:05:54.465 --> 04:05:55.974
TRAVIS: The three of us are in here.

6197
04:05:55.974 --> 04:05:57.308
MATT: All right.

6198
04:05:57.308 --> 04:05:59.177
So you three are in there. You see Beauregard

6199
04:05:59.177 --> 04:06:02.575
rush through and just barely make it inside.

6200
04:06:02.575 --> 04:06:05.415
Her hair and flesh is frostbitten

6201
04:06:05.415 --> 04:06:09.453
and covered in snow and ice. She's like (shivering),

6202
04:06:09.453 --> 04:06:14.295
shaking with just absolute interior frozen cold.

6203
04:06:14.295 --> 04:06:15.428
MARISHA: Reani?

6204
04:06:15.428 --> 04:06:18.265
MATT: You move at double speed, is what, 60?

6205
04:06:18.265 --> 04:06:20.165
It's 30 foot speed?

6206
04:06:20.165 --> 04:06:21.036
MICA: 30 foot, yeah.

6207
04:06:21.036 --> 04:06:23.355
MATT: So yeah, you're just running away.

6208
04:06:23.355 --> 04:06:25.364
That gets you-- you'd have another 30 feet

6209
04:06:25.364 --> 04:06:26.579
before you make it into the dome.

6210
04:06:26.579 --> 04:06:27.684
The dragon does have a turn, though,

6211
04:06:27.684 --> 04:06:28.517
as soon as you're running--

6212
04:06:28.517 --> 04:06:30.294
MARISHA: Does Caleb have a turn?

6213
04:06:30.294 --> 04:06:31.127
MATT: Caleb has a turn.

6214
04:06:31.127 --> 04:06:33.327
TRAVIS: Don't fucking go out of that dome.

6215
04:06:33.327 --> 04:06:34.603
MATT: Caleb can't cast anything out of the dome.

6216
04:06:34.603 --> 04:06:35.532
TRAVIS: You sit your ass in there.

6217
04:06:35.532 --> 04:06:36.874
MARISHA: Fuck, you're right, you're right, you're right.

6218
04:06:36.874 --> 04:06:38.040
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

6219
04:06:38.040 --> 04:06:40.506
Okay.
LAURA: The dome is so important.

6220
04:06:40.506 --> 04:06:42.045
(laughter)

6221
04:06:42.045 --> 04:06:43.615
MATT: The dragon, at this point, after landing

6222
04:06:43.615 --> 04:06:46.142
and breathing the blast of snow,

6223
04:06:46.142 --> 04:06:48.923
it's too thin-- I mean, the space in here

6224
04:06:48.923 --> 04:06:51.092
is about 25 feet wide. It can't fly through,

6225
04:06:51.092 --> 04:06:52.420
so it loses its fly speed.

6226
04:06:52.420 --> 04:06:54.950
TALIESIN: How close is the spider at this point?

6227
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:56.852
How close is she to the dome?

6228
04:06:56.852 --> 04:06:59.654
MATT: She is roughly 30 feet out at this point.

6229
04:06:59.654 --> 04:07:02.859
TALIESIN: I'm just going to, as coming, I'm just going to

6230
04:07:02.859 --> 04:07:06.999
try and pop a Bless on you, Caleb, and Beau.

6231
04:07:06.999 --> 04:07:09.333
MATT: Okay. Blesses are all up and around.

6232
04:07:09.333 --> 04:07:10.980
All right.

6233
04:07:10.980 --> 04:07:14.161
It is now the dragon's turn. The dragon will see

6234
04:07:14.161 --> 04:07:17.004
if it gets its breath weapon back.

6235
04:07:17.004 --> 04:07:17.837
Yep.

6236
04:07:17.837 --> 04:07:19.218
LAURA: Of course it does.
MATT: Of course it does.

6237
04:07:19.218 --> 04:07:21.149
I'm so sorry.

6238
04:07:21.149 --> 04:07:21.982
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

6239
04:07:21.982 --> 04:07:23.875
MATT: So--
MARISHA: Roll high.

6240
04:07:23.875 --> 04:07:26.536
MATT: I just rolled five and then a five again

6241
04:07:26.536 --> 04:07:28.287
for getting its breath weapon back.

6242
04:07:28.287 --> 04:07:29.815
So go ahead and make another constitution saving throw

6243
04:07:29.815 --> 04:07:31.687
for your ice spider.

6244
04:07:31.687 --> 04:07:32.862
TALIESIN: With a d4.

6245
04:07:32.862 --> 04:07:35.116
MICA: With a d4. I'm going to use my other Luck,

6246
04:07:35.116 --> 04:07:37.617
because that was shitty.
MATT: Okay.

6247
04:07:37.617 --> 04:07:40.199
MARISHA: Yes, come on.
MICA: With a d4.

6248
04:07:40.199 --> 04:07:45.124
That's 10 plus-- still only 11.

6249
04:07:45.124 --> 04:07:48.299
TALIESIN: Does it have-- with the damage resistance, though.

6250
04:07:48.299 --> 04:07:52.266
MICA: Yeah, well that's-- yeah.

6251
04:07:52.266 --> 04:07:53.553
I fail it, 11.

6252
04:07:53.553 --> 04:07:54.755
MATT: 64 points of cold damage.

6253
04:07:54.755 --> 04:07:56.049
MICA: No, 32.

6254
04:07:56.049 --> 04:07:57.634
MATT: Because it is resistant, so you take 32.

6255
04:07:57.634 --> 04:07:59.102
MICA: I am still a spider!
MATT: You're still up?

6256
04:07:59.102 --> 04:08:00.335
MICA: I am still a spider!

6257
04:08:00.335 --> 04:08:02.494
(laughter)

6258
04:08:02.494 --> 04:08:03.353
TALIESIN: That's the way to do it.

6259
04:08:03.353 --> 04:08:05.532
MATT: All right, now it's your guys' turn.

6260
04:08:05.532 --> 04:08:06.982
So using your next action, you now

6261
04:08:06.982 --> 04:08:07.815
have rummaged through while--

6262
04:08:07.815 --> 04:08:08.648
LAURA: I have the mithral.

6263
04:08:08.648 --> 04:08:09.981
MATT: You pull the mithral out

6264
04:08:09.981 --> 04:08:11.097
and you now have it in your hand,

6265
04:08:11.097 --> 04:08:12.975
and it's freezing your hand. You run over.

6266
04:08:12.975 --> 04:08:14.299
Do you want to head back to Jester

6267
04:08:14.299 --> 04:08:15.799
or do you want to try and make another pull from the--

6268
04:08:15.799 --> 04:08:17.872
LAURA: Fuck it, get something else! If I've got to waste

6269
04:08:17.872 --> 04:08:19.439
a whole other action just before I can

6270
04:08:19.439 --> 04:08:20.594
even do my Dimension Door.

6271
04:08:20.594 --> 04:08:21.444
SAM: You're not ready yet?

6272
04:08:21.444 --> 04:08:23.281
All right, great! I'll go over to another pile

6273
04:08:23.281 --> 04:08:24.424
and just grab something.

6274
04:08:24.424 --> 04:08:25.933
MATT: Okay, roll an investigation check for me.

6275
04:08:25.933 --> 04:08:27.545
With disadvantage because you're drunk.

6276
04:08:27.545 --> 04:08:29.584
SAM: That was-- that hit the side.

6277
04:08:29.584 --> 04:08:30.624
With disadvantage?

6278
04:08:30.624 --> 04:08:31.457
MATT: Because you're drunk.

6279
04:08:31.457 --> 04:08:32.511
SAM: Oh, that's right, you're right.

6280
04:08:32.511 --> 04:08:33.416
LAURA: God. Oh god!

6281
04:08:33.416 --> 04:08:34.721
SAM: That's okay, 18.

6282
04:08:34.721 --> 04:08:36.351
MATT: 18, okay.

6283
04:08:36.351 --> 04:08:38.395
You go ahead and reach in. Out of the corner of your eye,

6284
04:08:38.395 --> 04:08:40.367
you see like a faint blue glow and you reach in and grab,

6285
04:08:40.367 --> 04:08:41.961
your fingers touch something. It has a weird

6286
04:08:41.961 --> 04:08:44.091
moving metallic texture and it's cold to the touch,

6287
04:08:44.091 --> 04:08:45.679
and you pull it out and drag it over,

6288
04:08:45.679 --> 04:08:47.410
and as you reach over and you look in your hand

6289
04:08:47.410 --> 04:08:48.977
there is a piece of like chain mail

6290
04:08:48.977 --> 04:08:50.250
that's dangling out of your hand.

6291
04:08:50.250 --> 04:08:51.485
SAM: Just a piece of chain mail?

6292
04:08:51.485 --> 04:08:52.821
MATT: Like a chain shirt.

6293
04:08:52.821 --> 04:08:55.310
SAM: Oh, it's a chain shirt. Okay, cool.

6294
04:08:55.310 --> 04:08:58.799
Jester, we're alone in a dragon's lair.

6295
04:08:58.799 --> 04:09:02.940
Think how much the Traveler would love

6296
04:09:02.940 --> 04:09:07.090
a dick in this place.

6297
04:09:07.090 --> 04:09:10.273
Or at least a pamphlet, something!

6298
04:09:10.273 --> 04:09:12.036
LAURA: Oh, okay, yeah.

6299
04:09:12.036 --> 04:09:13.549
MATT: So both of your action this turn.

6300
04:09:13.549 --> 04:09:14.774
You get to contemplate what you do next turn

6301
04:09:14.774 --> 04:09:16.599
while the dragon is still distracted at the moment.

6302
04:09:16.599 --> 04:09:18.010
LAURA: For my bonus action.
MATT: Yes?

6303
04:09:18.010 --> 04:09:20.274
LAURA: Can I at least pull out one of my little

6304
04:09:20.274 --> 04:09:23.008
Traveler figurines that I made a bunch of with my paint?

6305
04:09:23.008 --> 04:09:23.841
MATT: Yeah.

6306
04:09:23.841 --> 04:09:26.054
Okay, I'll allow that.

6307
04:09:26.054 --> 04:09:28.373
Coming back, you're up, Reani.

6308
04:09:28.373 --> 04:09:33.365
MICA: I use my actions to sprint into the hut

6309
04:09:33.365 --> 04:09:36.369
and turn back into Reani.

6310
04:09:36.369 --> 04:09:39.616
Wait, wait, wait, question, how far away is it?

6311
04:09:39.616 --> 04:09:40.966
MATT: 30 feet.
MICA: 30 feet?

6312
04:09:40.966 --> 04:09:42.525
Cool, so I want to use--

6313
04:09:42.525 --> 04:09:44.632
MATT: 30 feet will get you just to the cusp of it.

6314
04:09:44.632 --> 04:09:47.190
You'll have to action to try and move the rest of the way.

6315
04:09:47.190 --> 04:09:48.635
MICA: Fuck it, I'll do it!

6316
04:09:48.635 --> 04:09:49.468
MATT: Okay.

6317
04:09:49.468 --> 04:09:50.301
MICA: I'm inside now, please.

6318
04:09:50.301 --> 04:09:51.134
MATT: Okay.

6319
04:09:51.134 --> 04:09:52.267
TALIESIN: You don't even have to-- yeah.

6320
04:09:52.267 --> 04:09:53.469
MICA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Ice spider.

6321
04:09:53.469 --> 04:09:55.451
MATT: Using your whole turn, you rush in,

6322
04:09:55.451 --> 04:09:57.462
skittering through the snow, up on the side,

6323
04:09:57.462 --> 04:10:00.551
as you can, you know, wall walk on the ice without issue,

6324
04:10:00.551 --> 04:10:04.979
scooting right in as the spider would be too large to enter

6325
04:10:04.979 --> 04:10:06.709
the actual interior of this dome

6326
04:10:06.709 --> 04:10:08.446
and would push other people out just from pushing in,

6327
04:10:08.446 --> 04:10:11.115
right as she hits the barrier, Reani (whooshes)

6328
04:10:11.115 --> 04:10:12.509
shifts back into regular form.

6329
04:10:12.509 --> 04:10:16.600
MICA: Before I shift back, I would like to

6330
04:10:16.600 --> 04:10:19.466
use a bonus action to expend one spell slot

6331
04:10:19.466 --> 04:10:21.904
to regain some hit points.

6332
04:10:21.904 --> 04:10:24.595
Okay, is it a bonus action to lose your form,

6333
04:10:24.595 --> 04:10:26.214
or do you drop it as a free action, that's my question.

6334
04:10:26.214 --> 04:10:27.281
MICA: Ah, fuck.

6335
04:10:27.281 --> 04:10:29.503
I think I drop it as a free action.

6336
04:10:29.503 --> 04:10:30.511
MATT: Double-check here.

6337
04:10:30.511 --> 04:10:31.770
TALIESIN: It's been a little while.
MICA: It's been a while.

6338
04:10:31.770 --> 04:10:32.879
MATT: ♪ It's been a while ♪

6339
04:10:32.879 --> 04:10:34.312
LAURA and TALIESIN: ♪ It's been a while! ♪

6340
04:10:35.495 --> 04:10:37.171
MICA: It just says you can revert back to normal form

6341
04:10:37.171 --> 04:10:38.283
as a bonus action.

6342
04:10:38.283 --> 04:10:39.123
MATT: So yeah.

6343
04:10:39.123 --> 04:10:40.460
MICA: Nevermind, all right, that's fine.

6344
04:10:40.460 --> 04:10:41.561
MATT: Yeah, the spider's too big to fit in there,

6345
04:10:41.561 --> 04:10:43.646
so it's up to you.
MICA: I'm in a hut with a cleric.

6346
04:10:43.646 --> 04:10:44.479
MATT: Okay.

6347
04:10:44.479 --> 04:10:45.749
MICA: So I'm back in.

6348
04:10:45.749 --> 04:10:47.700
MATT: You come rushing in, that extra bit of movement

6349
04:10:47.700 --> 04:10:49.233
as you push in, and right as you're about to--

6350
04:10:49.233 --> 04:10:51.189
you guys see the spider just barreling towards you,

6351
04:10:51.189 --> 04:10:53.242
like this isn't going to work, this isn't going to work!

6352
04:10:53.242 --> 04:10:56.233
Right as it impacts, reverts back into Reani,

6353
04:10:56.233 --> 04:10:58.302
and you guys catch her with the momentum

6354
04:10:58.302 --> 04:11:02.011
that she had rushing forward. She is far more frozen

6355
04:11:02.011 --> 04:11:04.418
and in pain than you expected, given the spider form,

6356
04:11:04.418 --> 04:11:05.786
but still surviving and standing.

6357
04:11:05.786 --> 04:11:08.758
TRAVIS: Oh my god, oh my god.

6358
04:11:08.758 --> 04:11:10.559
MICA: Just tears streaming down my face.

6359
04:11:10.559 --> 04:11:11.803
MATT: All right.

6360
04:11:11.803 --> 04:11:12.636
You guys.

6361
04:11:12.636 --> 04:11:13.927
MARISHA: Come on, come on!

6362
04:11:13.927 --> 04:11:14.872
SAM: What do we do?

6363
04:11:14.872 --> 04:11:16.926
LAURA: I'm going to Dimension Door us out of here!

6364
04:11:16.926 --> 04:11:18.718
SAM: What's that purple thing over there?

6365
04:11:18.718 --> 04:11:21.177
LAURA: Do you want to look at it while I set

6366
04:11:21.177 --> 04:11:23.553
the Traveler thing down and then Dimension Door.

6367
04:11:23.553 --> 04:11:25.854
MATT: Okay, you glance over, and you see

6368
04:11:25.854 --> 04:11:28.620
locked into the ice of the wall,

6369
04:11:28.620 --> 04:11:31.521
there's some strange metallic contraption.

6370
04:11:31.521 --> 04:11:35.233
You don't recognize its make. It looks weird and alien,

6371
04:11:35.233 --> 04:11:37.698
and that weird blue pulsing glow

6372
04:11:37.698 --> 04:11:41.704
that's just slowly lighting and then fading,

6373
04:11:41.704 --> 04:11:43.532
and lighting and then fading. You've never seen

6374
04:11:43.532 --> 04:11:45.574
something of this type of construction.

6375
04:11:45.574 --> 04:11:47.098
It's mostly embedded in the wall,

6376
04:11:47.098 --> 04:11:50.416
and it's huge. It's like 20 feet tall, five feet wide.

6377
04:11:50.416 --> 04:11:51.656
You have no idea what it is.

6378
04:11:51.656 --> 04:11:52.489
LAURA: You can't get it--

6379
04:11:52.489 --> 04:11:53.925
SAM: I can get it out. It'll be very loud.

6380
04:11:53.925 --> 04:11:57.216
LAURA: No, don't get it. Don't get it out, it's fine.

6381
04:11:57.216 --> 04:11:58.483
SAM: What is that thing?

6382
04:11:58.483 --> 04:12:00.374
LAURA: I don't know! I'm going to set the Traveler

6383
04:12:00.374 --> 04:12:03.683
figure down exactly where it can see it.

6384
04:12:03.683 --> 04:12:05.584
SAM: But that purple thing could be important.

6385
04:12:05.584 --> 04:12:07.286
LAURA: I don't know.

6386
04:12:07.286 --> 04:12:09.576
Nott, our friends could be dying down there!

6387
04:12:09.576 --> 04:12:10.927
We have to go save them.

6388
04:12:10.927 --> 04:12:12.661
SAM: You're right?

6389
04:12:12.661 --> 04:12:15.766
LAURA: I'm going to Dimension Door us.

6390
04:12:15.766 --> 04:12:16.932
MATT: To?

6391
04:12:16.932 --> 04:12:19.329
LAURA: The opposite side of the dome.

6392
04:12:19.329 --> 04:12:20.273
MATT: Okay.

6393
04:12:20.273 --> 04:12:21.719
(whooshes)
SAM: (gasps)

6394
04:12:21.719 --> 04:12:23.911
MATT: You guys appear, the dome right there,

6395
04:12:23.911 --> 04:12:26.802
and in that brief moment of like, oh, we made it,

6396
04:12:26.802 --> 04:12:30.939
you watch as Gelidon leaps towards--

6397
04:12:30.939 --> 04:12:32.114
LAURA: Step into the dome.

6398
04:12:32.114 --> 04:12:35.241
MATT: --the dome, and you guys step in right as you watch

6399
04:12:35.241 --> 04:12:37.732
this large, ancient white dragon (snarling)--

6400
04:12:37.732 --> 04:12:38.673
(screaming)

6401
04:12:38.673 --> 04:12:41.650
MATT: --just like scraping on and biting, its jaws opening,

6402
04:12:41.650 --> 04:12:43.496
grinding at the side.

6403
04:12:43.496 --> 04:12:48.013
(screaming)

6404
04:12:48.013 --> 04:12:51.369
MATT: Slamming into the side as hard as it can.

6405
04:12:51.369 --> 04:12:52.484
So what's happening?

6406
04:12:52.484 --> 04:12:53.673
You guys are all inside the dome.

6407
04:12:53.673 --> 04:12:55.137
SAM: Do the circle, draw the circle!

6408
04:12:55.137 --> 04:12:56.096
TALIESIN: You can't!

6409
04:12:56.096 --> 04:12:58.138
MARISHA: Oh <i>ja</i>, I take out my licorice--

6410
04:12:58.138 --> 04:12:59.820
Inside? Yeah, it's not concentration.

6411
04:12:59.820 --> 04:13:01.207
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

6412
04:13:01.207 --> 04:13:03.388
MATT: So it'll take a full minute.

6413
04:13:03.388 --> 04:13:05.267
All right, so Caleb begins drawing the circle

6414
04:13:05.267 --> 04:13:07.387
across the ice. You're setting it down.

6415
04:13:07.387 --> 04:13:09.734
You see the dragon's like angrily roaring

6416
04:13:09.734 --> 04:13:11.820
and slamming its claws, and on the opposite side,

6417
04:13:11.820 --> 04:13:14.031
you can see a handful of yetis that apparently

6418
04:13:14.031 --> 04:13:17.140
have come in since you last arrived are like, nope.

6419
04:13:17.140 --> 04:13:18.280
(laughter)

6420
04:13:18.280 --> 04:13:20.018
MATT: They just turn the other way.

6421
04:13:20.018 --> 04:13:21.205
(laughter)

6422
04:13:21.205 --> 04:13:24.738
MATT: You watch about 20 seconds in, Gelidon's anger

6423
04:13:24.738 --> 04:13:29.738
subsides, and begins like a caged lion stalking around.

6424
04:13:30.005 --> 04:13:31.713
MICA: Oh no!

6425
04:13:31.713 --> 04:13:33.109
MATT: The inside of the circle.

6426
04:13:33.109 --> 04:13:36.231
About 40 seconds in he goes, "Where do you think

6427
04:13:36.231 --> 04:13:38.081
"you're going?"

6428
04:13:38.081 --> 04:13:40.253
SAM: Oh no.
MICA: Oh no.

6429
04:13:40.253 --> 04:13:42.783
MATT: (sniffing)

6430
04:13:42.783 --> 04:13:45.313
(snarling)

6431
04:13:45.313 --> 04:13:46.501
50 seconds in.

6432
04:13:46.501 --> 04:13:48.359
TRAVIS: We didn't want to disturb you.

6433
04:13:48.359 --> 04:13:50.708
TALIESIN: For the record, we're really sorry.

6434
04:13:50.708 --> 04:13:53.615
I just throw seven platinum out the door.

6435
04:13:53.615 --> 04:13:56.149
(laughter)

6436
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:57.927
TALIESIN: We're really sorry.

6437
04:13:57.927 --> 04:13:59.471
MATT: Mark seven platinum off.

6438
04:13:59.471 --> 04:14:01.679
(laughter)

6439
04:14:01.679 --> 04:14:04.879
MATT: "I know your scent now."

6440
04:14:04.879 --> 04:14:06.129
MARISHA: Five seconds.

6441
04:14:07.164 --> 04:14:10.856
SAM: Mister, mister, are you sure

6442
04:14:10.856 --> 04:14:12.819
you can cast this inside this place?

6443
04:14:12.819 --> 04:14:14.862
MATT: (blowing)
LAURA: (screaming)

6444
04:14:14.862 --> 04:14:17.297
MATT: Unleashes a torrent, you watch the ice (cracking)

6445
04:14:17.297 --> 04:14:19.812
crackle up around and form this igloo dome

6446
04:14:19.812 --> 04:14:22.826
over the outside, right as the circle is finished.

6447
04:14:22.826 --> 04:14:25.175
You see it (whooshes), all of the same runes flair,

6448
04:14:25.175 --> 04:14:27.357
familiar from before. You have six seconds.

6449
04:14:27.357 --> 04:14:28.254
LAURA: Get in!

6450
04:14:28.254 --> 04:14:30.733
(all shouting)

6451
04:14:30.733 --> 04:14:33.013
MATT: You all rush in, that brief moment as you feel

6452
04:14:33.013 --> 04:14:35.599
the air pull out of your lungs and you all stumble forward,

6453
04:14:35.599 --> 04:14:39.729
gravityless, and then land onto the wooden,

6454
04:14:39.729 --> 04:14:42.168
warm floor interior of the Vellum Steeple

6455
04:14:42.168 --> 04:14:44.581
in the middle of Uthodurn.

6456
04:14:44.581 --> 04:14:46.834
As you all push through, knocking over a table,

6457
04:14:46.834 --> 04:14:49.114
as one of the various archivists there

6458
04:14:49.114 --> 04:14:51.186
loses all her papers, "(shouts),"

6459
04:14:51.186 --> 04:14:54.007
and everyone turns around and glances down at you guys,

6460
04:14:54.007 --> 04:14:58.070
breathing heavily, covered in frost, sweating.

6461
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:59.597
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

6462
04:14:59.597 --> 04:15:01.134
(shouting)

6463
04:15:01.134 --> 04:15:03.329
(laughter)

6464
04:15:03.329 --> 04:15:05.035
MATT: So if you're cool to join us for a little bit

6465
04:15:05.035 --> 04:15:06.455
next Thursday--
MICA: Yeah!

6466
04:15:06.455 --> 04:15:09.258
MATT: We'll finish out the rest of this little

6467
04:15:09.258 --> 04:15:10.477
mini story with you.

6468
04:15:10.477 --> 04:15:11.849
TALIESIN: I can't feel my toes!

6469
04:15:11.849 --> 04:15:15.005
(laughter)

6470
04:15:15.005 --> 04:15:16.491
TALIESIN: You did so good!

6471
04:15:16.491 --> 04:15:17.662
You did so good!

6472
04:15:17.662 --> 04:15:19.008
MATT: There were some clever moments in that.

6473
04:15:19.008 --> 04:15:20.344
I'll give you that, man.

6474
04:15:20.344 --> 04:15:21.714
TALIESIN: That was so clutch.

6475
04:15:21.714 --> 04:15:22.857
The spider was so clutch.

6476
04:15:22.857 --> 04:15:24.973
MICA: The spider saved my life.

6477
04:15:24.973 --> 04:15:25.865
LAURA: Oh my god.

6478
04:15:25.865 --> 04:15:27.326
TRAVIS: The spider saved a lot.

6479
04:15:27.326 --> 04:15:29.626
Dimension Door saved a lot.

6480
04:15:29.626 --> 04:15:32.904
Invisible drunk-ass goblin saved a lot.

6481
04:15:32.904 --> 04:15:33.927
MATT: (laughs)

6482
04:15:33.927 --> 04:15:37.639
MICA: And Fjord sat there watching it all happen.

6483
04:15:37.639 --> 04:15:39.114
MATT: Damn, guys.

6484
04:15:39.114 --> 04:15:41.106
LAURA: Oh my god.

6485
04:15:41.106 --> 04:15:42.443
MICA: I need a drink.

6486
04:15:42.443 --> 04:15:43.572
TALIESIN: I don't feel good.

6487
04:15:43.572 --> 04:15:46.409
MATT: Oh, we'll get a drink after this. That's the plan.

6488
04:15:46.409 --> 04:15:47.262
Oh man.

6489
04:15:47.262 --> 04:15:48.095
SAM: I'm shaking.

6490
04:15:48.095 --> 04:15:49.692
MARISHA: Yeah.

6491
04:15:49.692 --> 04:15:51.786
I can feel it, I can feel my neck.

6492
04:15:51.786 --> 04:15:53.647
TRAVIS: He said he knows our scent scent now.

6493
04:15:53.647 --> 04:15:54.480
MICA: Oh fuck.

6494
04:15:54.480 --> 04:15:55.313
LAURA: Yeah, yeah he did.

6495
04:15:55.313 --> 04:15:56.169
TALIESIN: We don't smell that--

6496
04:15:56.169 --> 04:15:57.519
it's going to take him a while.

6497
04:15:57.519 --> 04:15:59.100
MATT: You don't know if that was an idle threat

6498
04:15:59.100 --> 04:16:00.702
or just get into your mind, or if there is

6499
04:16:00.702 --> 04:16:01.952
something to it, who knows?

6500
04:16:01.952 --> 04:16:02.934
Dragons are weird.

6501
04:16:02.934 --> 04:16:03.915
LAURA: He's an ancient dragon.

6502
04:16:03.915 --> 04:16:05.409
MICA: I can just imagine everybody take nap somewhere

6503
04:16:05.409 --> 04:16:07.938
and a dragon shows up and goes "I found you!"

6504
04:16:07.938 --> 04:16:10.790
TALIESIN: Those two weird machines, that was just a TiVo

6505
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:13.302
and a Netflix. I mean, like, he doesn't leave that cave.

6506
04:16:13.302 --> 04:16:16.580
MATT: Yeah, it's like the hoardiest of hoarder dragons.

6507
04:16:16.580 --> 04:16:18.418
TRAVIS: I love how one of them was a TiVo.

6508
04:16:18.418 --> 04:16:19.251
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6509
04:16:19.251 --> 04:16:21.175
He's a dragon, he doesn't get out much.

6510
04:16:21.175 --> 04:16:22.027
He's old.

6511
04:16:22.027 --> 04:16:23.153
MATT: He's about a decade behind the times.

6512
04:16:23.153 --> 04:16:24.753
TALIESIN: He doesn't know how Netflix works.

6513
04:16:24.753 --> 04:16:26.154
Doesn't have grandkids.

6514
04:16:26.154 --> 04:16:27.448
MATT: I was super excited for that.

6515
04:16:27.448 --> 04:16:29.061
I had no idea how that was going to be done.

6516
04:16:29.061 --> 04:16:30.901
There was a lot of possible pieces around here--

6517
04:16:30.901 --> 04:16:35.229
like, I'm fucking-- I'm all about that, man.

6518
04:16:35.229 --> 04:16:37.025
That was awesome!

6519
04:16:37.025 --> 04:16:37.858
Okay.

6520
04:16:37.858 --> 04:16:39.147
SAM: That map!

6521
04:16:39.147 --> 04:16:41.814
MATT: And thank you to Dwarven Forge.

6522
04:16:43.566 --> 04:16:45.582
Most of these pieces are from their Kickstarter last year,

6523
04:16:45.582 --> 04:16:47.076
but they haven't shipped yet, so they were nice enough

6524
04:16:47.076 --> 04:16:50.091
to send out a lot of these sample prototypes for use

6525
04:16:50.091 --> 04:16:51.481
in this map--
SAM: Oh really? These are prototypes?

6526
04:16:51.481 --> 04:16:52.835
MATT: Yeah, a lot of them are.

6527
04:16:52.835 --> 04:16:54.755
So these sets will be available I think in a couple months,

6528
04:16:54.755 --> 04:16:56.933
so thank you Nate and the whole team at Dwarven Forge

6529
04:16:56.933 --> 04:17:00.214
for letting me play with this awesome ice set for this.

6530
04:17:00.214 --> 04:17:01.866
TALIESIN: This die didn't roll too badly.

6531
04:17:01.866 --> 04:17:02.699
MATT: But yeah.

6532
04:17:02.699 --> 04:17:03.763
TALIESIN: Oh, there it was.

6533
04:17:03.763 --> 04:17:06.106
MATT: Okay, well.

6534
04:17:06.106 --> 04:17:09.264
We'll pick this up next Thursday. (laughs)

6535
04:17:09.264 --> 04:17:10.786
MICA: If I'm still alive by then.

6536
04:17:10.786 --> 04:17:12.235
MATT: Yeah, if we all survive until then.

6537
04:17:12.235 --> 04:17:13.983
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to heal everybody. It's all good.

6538
04:17:13.983 --> 04:17:16.210
MATT: Until then guys, thank you for joining us tonight,

6539
04:17:16.210 --> 04:17:19.933
as always, we love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

6540
04:17:19.933 --> 04:17:20.830
Good night.

6541
04:17:20.830 --> 04:17:23.044
(cheering and laughing)

6542
04:17:23.044 --> 04:17:27.986
(dramatic music)

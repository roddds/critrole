00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.898
MATT: Hello, and welcome to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

00:00:04.898 --> 00:00:07.084
actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:09.202
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:14.541
MATT: We are already in top form tonight, if you
couldn't tell. Before we go ahead and jump into

00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:19.064
our story, let's go ahead and get through some
announcements for the evening. First, we have two

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:23.643
wonderful sponsors tonight, beginning with our
friends, who have continued through the first part

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:27.048
of this campaign and to the new year,
D&amp;D Beyond. Sam?

00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:32.957
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond! Is the camera on me? I can't
tell. It is on me! D&amp;D Beyond, everybody. Last

00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:39.391
week we kicked off my campaign to become president
of D&amp;D Beyond. That campaign will continue through

00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:47.686
a lot of the year. We have lots of big things
planned, but the campaign is taking a week off

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:54.971
this week. Instead, I spent most of this week
making an infomercial for our good friends at D&amp;D

00:00:55.028 --> 00:01:00.370
Beyond. I shot, I edited it, I added music. It's a
really cool piece. It talks about all the great

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.465
features of D&amp;D Beyond, how it streamlines
game-play, and you should all go subscribe to it

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:11.240
right now at dndbeyond.com. Anyway, I made this
infomercial. I'm going to give it to Max right now.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.880
LIAM: I am so nervous right now.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.779
SAM: He's going to pop it up there and play it. I
think you guys will like it. I'm an &lt;i&gt;auteur&lt;/i&gt;, so

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:25.051
don't be too critical. Whenever it's loaded up,
Max, take it away.

00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:39.165
(muffled, singing the D&amp;D Beyond theme song)

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:45.784
Okay, that was not the right video. Sorry about
that. That was a technical glitch, Max; that was

00:01:45.784 --> 00:01:51.159
not the right one. You know what, play the next
video on the thumb drive. I'm sure it's the next

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.731
one down in the folder, so go ahead and hit play
on-- the next video will probably be the one.

00:01:57.731 --> 00:02:09.234
Kids, kids, let me in. Let me in the house. Kids,
this isn't funny. Kids?

00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:18.546
Okay, no, this is embarrassing. You know what,
Max, it's probably not that folder. Try the other

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:24.660
folder, the one labeled "Sam awesome stuff". Try
that folder on the thumb drive and play--

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.091
I'm auditioning for the role of Joel on the
movie-- the video game Last on Us? Last on Us.

00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:37.367
(clears throat) Take one. (high-pitched) Ellie, do
you realize what your life means, running

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:38.685
off like that?

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:44.655
No, Max, no! It's "Sam awesome stuff 2019", not
"Sam awesome stuff 2012". That was the wrong

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:52.155
folder! Go to the one marked 2019 and play that
one. Come on, Max, get it right. Play it!

00:02:52.155 --> 00:03:02.700
Hey, Liam. I'm waiting. When you get home
tonight, I might be asleep, but it's okay.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.027
Wake me up, okay? (kiss noise)
Love you, baby. Bye.

00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:09.809
TRAVIS: (screaming)

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:15.570
I'm sorry, that was not supposed to be for the
public. That was something that I sexted to Liam.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.912
It was not supposed to be released.

00:03:18.913 --> 00:03:20.845
TRAVIS: (retching)

00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:26.417
SAM: The video that I made, it talked about how
affordable D&amp;D Beyond is, how you can get your

00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:32.629
content, your guides, your campaign guides, all in
one place. There's content for DMs and players. It

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.350
really makes the whole process great. You know
what, I think it would be safe to play all the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.440
rest of the videos. Go ahead and
play all of the rest of the videos.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.698
[sensual music]

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.030
[beep]

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.715
Come on, guys, let me in the house.

00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:49.304
[beep]

00:03:49.304 --> 00:03:51.316
[rock music]

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:51.905
[beep]

00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:58.753
[pop music]

00:03:58.753 --> 00:04:00.016
[beep]

00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:08.339
SAM: Now that I'm thinking about it, I think that
was the other thumb drive that I left at home, and

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:14.647
I think this one-- Max, I apologize. I think this
one's on me, so I apologize, and I apologize to

00:04:14.647 --> 00:04:17.978
D&amp;D Beyond. Please subscribe now.

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:21.861
LIAM: Technically still awesome stuff, though.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.232
TRAVIS: I can't unsee that.

00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:27.804
MARISHA: Don't let Travis lie to you;
he's got a half-er.

00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:30.188
TRAVIS: I am doing the forward lean.

00:04:30.188 --> 00:04:31.542
MATT: I thought I felt it under the table.

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:33.830
TALIESIN and LAURA: No!

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.060
MATT: Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for being our
fantastic sponsor in spite of Sam Riegel

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.844
giving your announcements every week.

00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:42.419
LIAM: Are they still our sponsor?
Can we check on that?

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.296
SAM: Yeah, they have canceled the contract.

00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:48.626
TRAVIS: All of our pages are blank.

00:04:48.626 --> 00:04:54.251
MATT: Sam is not doing this next intro. As for our
second sponsor tonight, our friends at Idle

00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:59.679
Champions. For those who aren't familiar with Idle
Champions-- Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.598
is the full name of it. It's a D&amp;D strategy video
game that brings a variety of popular D&amp;D

00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:13.079
characters together for the first time in one
world. You can play it on PC, Steam and mobile,

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:17.316
iPad and Android, but apparently now it's
available on Xbox and PS4, which is awesome. You

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:21.607
have characters from Drizzt of the Forgotten
Realms all the way up to Arkhan, who you saw--

00:05:21.607 --> 00:05:22.516
LIAM: The Cruel?

00:05:22.516 --> 00:05:30.647
MATT: Arkhan the Cruel. The scourge of Vecna and
Vox Machina. There's 200 unique quests based on

00:05:30.647 --> 00:05:35.866
official D&amp;D content like Waterdeep: Dragon Heist,
Curse of Strahd, and all those previous stories.

00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:43.121
It's all in there, so you can check it out at
critrole.com/idlechampions for more information.

00:05:43.122 --> 00:05:50.256
On next Wednesday, January 23rd at 5:00pm
Pacific, here on our Twitch channel,

00:05:50.256 --> 00:05:52.532
here at Critical Role, tune into Pub Draw--

00:05:52.532 --> 00:05:54.094
MARISHA: Pub Draw!

00:05:54.094 --> 00:05:58.419
MATT: The new creative series featuring art
lessons from our fantastic friend of the family,

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.681
Babs Tarr. She teaches Marisha and then other
members of the extended family how to draw. And

00:06:04.681 --> 00:06:10.002
you as well, as you follow along and do your own
artwork. Between the Sheets is coming back very

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:15.683
soon. The first episode of season two of Between
the Sheets airs on Monday January 28th and 7:00pm

00:06:15.683 --> 00:06:22.567
Pacific here at twitch.tv/criticalrole. It's going
to be awesome. This whole next season's awesome,

00:06:22.567 --> 00:06:32.340
so look forward to that. January 18th to the 20th,
this weekend-- tomorrow! Saturday and Sunday, at

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.135
Gallery Nucleus in Los Angeles, we have the Art of
Exandria art show. We've been wanting to do an art

00:06:37.136 --> 00:06:41.626
show for so long, it's our first time actually
being able to get it done! We saw pictures today;

00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:46.058
the setup looks amazing. Over 50 pieces of art
from our fantastic Critter community will be on

00:06:46.058 --> 00:06:52.103
display there. If you're in the area, come check
it out, hang out, run into other Critters. It

00:06:52.103 --> 00:06:56.909
looks to be a lot of fun this weekend, so hope to
see you guys there. For more details on that, you

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:03.645
can go to critrole.com/events. Then on January
19th, this Saturday, we're bringing back most of

00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:07.486
Vox Machina for our Search for Grog live show here
in Los Angeles.

00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:09.325
LIAM: What do you mean?

00:07:09.326 --> 00:07:13.049
MARISHA: Spoilers, he doesn't know yet.

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:19.575
MATT: Sorry! Watch the last episode before coming
to the show on Saturday. The VOD will be available

00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:24.138
in February. Check out critrole.com for the
announcement and be sure to stay tuned for more

00:07:24.138 --> 00:07:28.135
info as it becomes available. All right, I
believe--

00:07:28.136 --> 00:07:29.665
LIAM: I've got one announcement.

00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:31.619
MATT: Well then, throw it in there, Liam!

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:37.460
LIAM: Tomorrow on Netflix, Carmen Sandiego, the
new cartoon starts! Mary Elizabeth and I play

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.717
bad guys. It is a gorgeous cartoon.
I can't wait. The whole thing's going to

00:07:42.717 --> 00:07:45.205
vomit onto Netflix tomorrow. Check it out.

00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:48.042
LAURA: No. I mean not that, he showed me
a picture of his nipples, and I said no.

00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:50.198
Yes to Carmen Sandiego, though.

00:07:50.198 --> 00:07:52.698
SAM: I don't think she likes Carmen Sandiego.

00:07:55.438 --> 00:07:58.337
TRAVIS: Where in the world is-- no!

00:08:00.312 --> 00:08:02.361
MARISHA: That's such strong feelings.

00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:05.943
MATT: Well, all of us had strong feelings
when it comes to a capella. Don't we, Sam?

00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:11.437
SAM: (singing) Hmm-bop, boop ba doop a mmmbop.

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:19.347
MATT: Bow! Without further ado friends, at the end
of the announcements, I think it is time

00:08:19.347 --> 00:08:23.645
for us to dive into tonight's episode
of Critical Role.

00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:28.646
[water bubbling]

00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:33.241
[thunder]

00:08:33.631 --> 00:08:35.313
[explosion]

00:08:35.905 --> 00:08:40.185
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:08:40.482 --> 00:08:44.404
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:57.617
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:08:57.617 --> 00:09:05.131
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:09.108
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:19.068
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:09:19.068 --> 00:09:26.597
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:09:26.597 --> 00:09:30.304
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:09:30.756 --> 00:09:38.298
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:09:38.758 --> 00:09:44.127
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:09:44.127 --> 00:09:53.497
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:09:54.596 --> 00:10:00.869
[fire burning]

00:10:01.908 --> 00:10:05.830
MATT: You guys are slow on the draw tonight.
Welcome back.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:14.406
SAM: I don't know. I said "burglary taint." I was
caught between two Carmen Sandiego things.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:17.328
LIAM: For some reason, not as funny
as just "bobs."

00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:22.762
MATT: Getting creative now.

00:10:22.762 --> 00:10:25.916
TALIESIN: You're giving people a peek
behind the curtain right now.

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.968
LIAM: We've been doing this for four years.

00:10:27.968 --> 00:10:29.064
TALIESIN: I know, fair.

00:10:29.064 --> 00:10:36.007
MATT: So last we left off, The Mighty Nein, after
finishing their journey to the secondary temple of

00:10:36.007 --> 00:10:42.003
Uk'otoa's sealing, managed to deliver the second
of the collected orbs and bring him one step

00:10:42.004 --> 00:10:47.723
closer to his release. You then exited back to
your ship, which another ship was found to be

00:10:47.723 --> 00:10:52.426
giving chase, apparently notified by your presence
from the large geyser that erupted from the ocean

00:10:52.427 --> 00:10:58.956
due to the unsealing. A short chase then
commenced, leading to a much shorter battle.

00:10:58.956 --> 00:11:00.616
TALIESIN: Thank you, next.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:05.814
TRAVIS: Disadvantage the whole game.

00:11:05.814 --> 00:11:15.419
MATT: Yeah. All said and done, hearing rumors
about possible dangers continuing to push deeper

00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:20.843
into the empire from the Xhorhasian hordes, you
begin to make your way back towards the direction

00:11:20.843 --> 00:11:26.003
of the empire. Getting your things in order,
you've made your way back through the Swavain

00:11:26.004 --> 00:11:30.032
Islands and you are just now entering
the port of Nicodranas.

00:11:30.032 --> 00:11:32.604
LAURA: Nicodranas!

00:11:32.604 --> 00:11:41.558
MATT: As you approach, Mighty Nein, what would you
like to do? There's a person on the deck right now

00:11:41.558 --> 00:11:46.597
who's waving down and bringing you in, bringing
out a spyglass to check your banner, your ship

00:11:46.597 --> 00:11:50.654
name. It looks like you're probably going to be in
the process of checking in shortly.

00:11:50.654 --> 00:11:53.081
TRAVIS: We forged those documents, right?

00:11:53.081 --> 00:11:55.393
LAURA: Yes, we did. We forged them real good.

00:11:55.393 --> 00:11:58.190
TRAVIS: What was the ship's name?

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.684
LAURA: We never changed it;
it's still The Balleater.

00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:02.911
TRAVIS: Okay, just checking. That makes sense.

00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:07.819
MARISHA: I think I just got his name as
Wharfmaster. Male dwarf,

00:12:07.819 --> 00:12:10.003
matted beard, thick gold hoops.

00:12:10.734 --> 00:12:12.827
MATT: Wharfmaster Ignus.

00:12:12.827 --> 00:12:14.729
TRAVIS: That's right, Ignus.

00:12:14.729 --> 00:12:20.062
LIAM: Are we making any attempt to hide our
persons, disguise our persons?

00:12:20.062 --> 00:12:21.329
LAURA: I think so, yeah.

00:12:22.129 --> 00:12:24.178
SAM: Smart, smart, always smart.

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:31.626
TRAVIS: I will Mask of Many Faces and give myself
a bald head with a nice little red flavor saver

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:37.391
right here, and very expensive red and
gold-looking flowy stuff.

00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:41.382
MATT: Okay, all right. Anybody else changing their
appearance upon entry?

00:12:41.382 --> 00:12:48.140
TALIESIN: Sure. I'll go for my standard shaggy
red-headed mess.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.520
MATT: You got it.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:59.827
LAURA: Yeah. I guess I'm going to be human with
black hair instead of blue hair.

00:13:01.853 --> 00:13:09.642
SAM: I will also change. I want to see
what it would be like to be a goblin still,

00:13:10.303 --> 00:13:15.819
except with not green skin.
Let's pick a different color.

00:13:15.819 --> 00:13:17.665
MATT: What different color?

00:13:17.665 --> 00:13:20.379
LAURA: Do you want to be blue?
Blue's a really good color.

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:23.524
SAM: Maybe pink. Something that's like,
"Oh, that's not a monster."

00:13:23.524 --> 00:13:26.097
TRAVIS: Not ostentatious, or attracts
attention at all.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:29.343
LAURA: Really nice to look at. Like,
"Look at that little pink girl!"

00:13:29.344 --> 00:13:32.105
SAM: Yeah. "That's a little pink pixie thing"
or something.

00:13:32.105 --> 00:13:34.006
TRAVIS: Someone might try to kidnap you.

00:13:34.006 --> 00:13:35.742
LAURA: Give yourself wings!

00:13:35.743 --> 00:13:37.173
SAM: Wings?

00:13:37.173 --> 00:13:39.797
LAURA: Yeah, little cute dragonfly wings on you.

00:13:39.797 --> 00:13:41.224
SAM: The tiniest wings.

00:13:41.224 --> 00:13:44.244
LAURA: Little teeney. You want dragonfly, or--?

00:13:44.244 --> 00:13:46.253
SAM: Dragonfly wings, yes.

00:13:46.983 --> 00:13:49.468
MATT: Okay. All right.

00:13:49.468 --> 00:13:57.822
LIAM: Six inches shorter, brown hair, no beard
and brown robes, like the simplest student.

00:13:58.722 --> 00:13:59.973
MATT: Understood.

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:02.914
LAURA: I'm going to put some makeup
on Beau over here.

00:14:02.914 --> 00:14:05.125
MARISHA: And I brush my hair.

00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:07.723
TALIESIN: Who are you? My god,
what happened to Beau?

00:14:07.723 --> 00:14:12.400
LAURA: I'm going to do Yasha's makeup again, but
I'm not going to make her look like a snake person

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.640
this time. This time she's going to look real
cute. I'm going to put some red lipstick on her,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.113
and maybe put her hair in a topknot.

00:14:22.322 --> 00:14:27.345
MATT: Yasha accepts, does not really care to see
what it looks like, but just trusts your opinion.

00:14:27.345 --> 00:14:31.867
MARISHA: I grab one of Avantika's coats,
rip the sleeves off of them, put it on.

00:14:31.867 --> 00:14:34.252
MATT: (laughs) Avantika's coats
don't have sleeves.

00:14:35.252 --> 00:14:36.867
MARISHA: My kind of woman.

00:14:36.867 --> 00:14:38.973
TALIESIN: Baller move.

00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:49.780
MATT: You guys are pulled into the Restless Wharf.
You are brought into the side, the ship is brought

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:55.922
up against the dock, a couple of dockhands start
to go on and help get the ship pulled in, tied

00:14:55.922 --> 00:15:04.775
off. Planks are put down. Ignus eventually comes
back over and goes, "All right, so tell me,

00:15:04.775 --> 00:15:07.481
"what is your ship? Paperwork, please!"

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:17.747
TRAVIS: This is the Balleater. It's been quite a while
since we were in Nicodranas. I'm Captain Tristan.

00:15:17.747 --> 00:15:21.324
MATT: "Captain Tristan."

00:15:21.348 --> 00:15:27.208
TRAVIS: We will probably be here for, I don't
know, an extended period of time. We might make

00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:34.106
our way up into the Empire. Do you have any
extended rentals on the dock here?

00:15:34.106 --> 00:15:39.918
MATT: At this point, behind, Orly leans in
and goes: "Ahem.

00:15:39.918 --> 00:15:45.190
"Captain, wasn't there a plan to run
business in your stead?"

00:15:45.687 --> 00:15:50.467
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, thank you, Orly.
I'm so forgetful. Yes.

00:15:50.467 --> 00:15:54.149
LAURA: Here's your documentation sir, Orly, sir.

00:15:54.149 --> 00:16:01.243
MATT: Orly takes it. "Here you are." Hands it over
to the Wharfmaster. Steps away for a minute, goes

00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:09.699
and checks everything, eventually comes back.
That's the Wharfmaster. Misfires, finally.

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:14.963
SAM: Is he mocking Orly? Oh my god!
The Wharfmaster's a dick!

00:16:16.306 --> 00:16:23.983
MATT: He comes back. "Paperwork is all fine. All
right, we will be talking." He points to Orly, and

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:33.589
Orly gives him a nod. Looks back at the rest of
you. "Well, you all be safe. Even if you got some

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:40.638
"of that fancy m-m-magic word stuff, right?"

00:16:40.638 --> 00:16:43.967
LAURA: Yes, I will definitely send you a message
if we need anything.

00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:45.356
MATT: "I can too, probably."

00:16:45.356 --> 00:16:48.988
LAURA: Oh! Awesome!

00:16:48.988 --> 00:16:49.834
SAM: Really?

00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:52.210
LAURA: He's magic.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.316
MATT: "Y'all travel safe."

00:16:54.316 --> 00:16:56.621
TRAVIS: Be well, Orly. Carry on.

00:16:56.621 --> 00:17:00.249
LAURA: Take care of that crew,
they're real good!

00:17:00.249 --> 00:17:03.848
MATT: You watch as Marius, off the side, hands
something to Orly, and Orly looks off to you all.

00:17:03.848 --> 00:17:08.282
"Don't worry, I fully intend to,"
and puts a captain hat on.

00:17:08.282 --> 00:17:10.025
ALL: Yeah!

00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:13.122
SAM: One of the cannons is broken.
I found it that way, though, so

00:17:13.122 --> 00:17:15.649
you should probably fix that while we're gone.

00:17:16.443 --> 00:17:27.231
MATT: Marius makes a note. With that, you guys
have made your way back to Nicodranas. The

00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:32.363
bustling streets are there. It's early afternoon
we'll say, about 1:30, 2:00 in the afternoon.

00:17:32.363 --> 00:17:38.802
There are a bunch of people currently dealing with
shipments being taken out of ships, put back into

00:17:38.802 --> 00:17:44.861
ships. As when you were coming in, there's a
number of naval vessels in the outskirts of the

00:17:44.862 --> 00:17:53.092
harbor as well. It's a busy time of the day, but
no one seems to be paying you too much mind. The

00:17:53.092 --> 00:17:59.386
zhelezo are present, haven't gotten thicker
immediate arrival, but you're still nervously

00:17:59.386 --> 00:18:06.235
keeping an eye out, though you have no real
conspicuous presentation other than Beau.

00:18:06.235 --> 00:18:09.514
So what would you like to do?
Where are you off to?

00:18:09.675 --> 00:18:16.956
TALIESIN: I've had a thing I've been wanting
to do for a while, and I figure now is

00:18:16.957 --> 00:18:21.971
possibly the time to take care of this.
I want to find a blacksmith.

00:18:23.085 --> 00:18:26.864
SAM: You seem unreasonably excited about that.

00:18:26.944 --> 00:18:33.188
TALIESIN: Well, it's not often that I have a pet
project. I haven't had one in a while, and that

00:18:33.189 --> 00:18:39.705
was the way I used to keep myself excited and busy
back when I was home, so I've got a pet project.

00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:40.728
It's been a while.

00:18:40.729 --> 00:18:43.774
SAM: Do you need any help? What, are you going to
make something?

00:18:43.774 --> 00:18:48.368
TALIESIN: I pull out the broken sword hilt that I
have.

00:18:48.368 --> 00:18:49.905
SAM: Oh, yeah, that.

00:18:49.905 --> 00:18:56.672
TALIESIN: I'd love to see about getting this
fixed, maybe, as a token of appreciation for

00:18:56.672 --> 00:19:00.595
Mr. Fjord for doing such a good job taking
care of himself on his own quest and

00:19:00.595 --> 00:19:04.945
not getting sidelined into some bad thoughts.

00:19:05.065 --> 00:19:08.391
TRAVIS: That is very thoughtful of you.
Thank you!

00:19:08.391 --> 00:19:10.862
TALIESIN: I also don't know
how to find a blacksmith.

00:19:10.862 --> 00:19:12.961
LAURA: Oh, I think I know a pretty good one!

00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:13.958
MATT: Okay.

00:19:16.043 --> 00:19:21.314
TRAVIS: Access the memory banks. (warbling)

00:19:21.315 --> 00:19:26.676
MATT: You can make a history check. As you,
however, have not spent a lot of time traveling

00:19:26.676 --> 00:19:30.634
around Nicodranas, as much as you grew up here,
you stayed indoors most of the time.

00:19:30.634 --> 00:19:35.134
LAURA: I know of a really good one!

00:19:35.134 --> 00:19:36.770
I rolled a four.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.910
MATT: You know of a really good one in Zadash.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:44.925
LAURA: Oh, shit, I think it's in Zadash. That's
where I got that box made, right?

00:19:44.925 --> 00:19:47.302
SAM: Yeah, that metal box? Yeah.

00:19:47.302 --> 00:19:49.015
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, never mind.

00:19:49.016 --> 00:19:49.968
TALIESIN: Metal box?

00:19:49.968 --> 00:19:51.022
LAURA: Do you want it?

00:19:51.022 --> 00:19:54.234
TALIESIN: I don't know, I've never had a metal box
before.

00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:56.619
SAM: We could probably ask around
for a blacksmith.

00:19:56.619 --> 00:19:58.190
TALIESIN: What do you do with it?

00:19:58.191 --> 00:20:00.142
LAURA: Wait, I left it at the blacksmith.

00:20:00.142 --> 00:20:03.142
TALIESIN: Oh, we're getting so afar. You just
mimed a metal box.

00:20:03.142 --> 00:20:04.060
LAURA: I did, yeah.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.299
TALIESIN: That's amazing. You're very talented.

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:08.334
SAM: Let's go ask around for a blacksmith.

00:20:08.334 --> 00:20:10.780
TRAVIS: I think Caleb had something to say.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.032
LIAM: Jester.

00:20:12.032 --> 00:20:12.927
LAURA: Yeah?

00:20:12.927 --> 00:20:17.561
LIAM: What about a place that has writing
materials? Paper and ink and that sort of thing?

00:20:17.561 --> 00:20:20.288
LAURA: Oh, yeah, my mom was big on books.

00:20:23.768 --> 00:20:25.393
TALIESIN: There's a joke in there.

00:20:25.393 --> 00:20:27.026
MATT: Make a history check.

00:20:28.115 --> 00:20:30.662
LAURA: It was a little bit better. 11.

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:35.918
MATT: You have not been to a bookstore,
necessarily. Most of the books that you had were

00:20:35.918 --> 00:20:40.424
brought to you by your mom, but you could probably
wander around and find one eventually.

00:20:40.424 --> 00:20:42.610
LAURA: Yeah, I'll lead the way.

00:20:42.611 --> 00:20:45.187
MATT: Okay, are you guys beelining it to a
bookshop, then?

00:20:45.187 --> 00:20:49.527
SAM: Why don't we split off and some of us can
look for a blacksmith and some can look for a

00:20:49.528 --> 00:20:53.126
bookshop and then we'll reconnoiter somewhere.

00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:58.023
TALIESIN: If the people looking for a bookstore
find a blacksmith, they can send a little Message,

00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:03.105
and if the people looking for a blacksmith find a
bookshop, I assume we should buy everything we see.

00:21:03.938 --> 00:21:10.279
TRAVIS: Sure. I'll go to blacksmith with Caduce.

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:13.437
LAURA: I was going to lead Caleb
to the bookstore.

00:21:13.437 --> 00:21:16.142
MARISHA: I'll go to the blacksmith with the guys.

00:21:16.143 --> 00:21:18.259
LIAM: Are you going to come along?

00:21:18.259 --> 00:21:20.122
SAM: I would love to come along, yes.

00:21:20.752 --> 00:21:26.264
MATT: Who's going to the blacksmith? Team
blacksmith, you begin to wander through the

00:21:26.264 --> 00:21:31.950
streets, asking questions around. Eventually, some
of the local zhelezo lead you over to the place

00:21:31.951 --> 00:21:41.485
called Ingots and Hammers. It seems to be a humble
size, but this isn't a very big smithing town,

00:21:41.485 --> 00:21:47.647
necessarily. In fact, one of them you speak to
goes like, "Port Zoon would be more the place to

00:21:47.647 --> 00:21:53.663
"go if you're looking for good, brawny blacksmiths,
but there is Ingots and Hammers, maybe." They head

00:21:53.663 --> 00:21:58.463
you over in that direction. The exterior of it,
most of it the heavy stone base of the building--

00:21:58.463 --> 00:22:04.904
it's a standard rectangle, most of it open on the
side facing the street so you can see the smoke

00:22:04.904 --> 00:22:13.150
from the forge itself pouring out. It doesn't have
a specific chimney built more than it billows out

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:19.193
in two places to create these two drifting streams
that head up. As you walk up, you can see there

00:22:19.193 --> 00:22:23.540
isn't immediately work being done. It looks like
perhaps there is a mid-afternoon break, and you do

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:35.154
see a tan skinned, heavyset, burly looking fellow,
human, smooth bald head, a split lip that healed

00:22:35.154 --> 00:22:39.603
back and it has this big scar piece that gives him
a little bit of character, and he sits there in

00:22:39.603 --> 00:22:44.957
the middle of eating a bowl of fruit and glances
up at you. "Hello? Can I help you?"

00:22:45.747 --> 00:22:51.494
TALIESIN: Yes. I was looking to have a sword
repaired, a very unusual sword.

00:22:51.494 --> 00:23:03.175
MATT: "Let me see it." He sets down his bowl and
walks over. "Oh. Just a second, hold on." Sets it

00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:09.805
down and rummages through a small shelf unit in
the back and pulls out a few books and pulls out

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:17.690
one tome, opens it up and sets it down and begins
thumbing through, page to page. Takes about five,

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:27.053
six minutes to find something before he stops and
goes, "My apologies. This is not really a form of

00:23:27.053 --> 00:23:31.726
"forging that I can repair. This is Uthudurnian."

00:23:31.726 --> 00:23:33.478
TALIESIN: Uthudurnian?

00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:40.922
MATT: "It's a very far north, very isolated
people. Dual society, dwarves and elves together."

00:23:41.332 --> 00:23:42.345
LAURA: Whoa.

00:23:42.345 --> 00:23:48.554
MATT: "Merger of the two styles of forging make
for very unique weaponry, but a little bit

00:23:48.554 --> 00:23:50.929
"out of my skill range. My apologies."

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:56.127
TALIESIN: No, that's good to know. Would you know
of anyone who could point us in the right

00:23:56.127 --> 00:23:59.283
direction or would we have to
probably venture that direction?

00:23:59.284 --> 00:24:01.287
MATT: "It's north of the Empire."

00:24:01.287 --> 00:24:03.036
TALIESIN: North of the Empire?

00:24:03.806 --> 00:24:05.911
MATT: "Up in them Wildlands."

00:24:06.451 --> 00:24:07.508
TALIESIN: Well, now.

00:24:10.168 --> 00:24:12.887
TRAVIS: North of the Dunrock Mountains,
would you say?

00:24:12.887 --> 00:24:14.590
MATT: "Yes, that's the place!"

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:23.091
TRAVIS: That's fucking way up there.
We are here, and we got to go there.

00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:29.726
TALIESIN: That's barely two-and-a-half,
three feet. I mean, what's the scale on that?

00:24:29.726 --> 00:24:32.207
It's like one-half scale, double?

00:24:32.207 --> 00:24:33.748
TRAVIS: Hundred miles.

00:24:34.978 --> 00:24:35.764
TALIESIN: Wow!

00:24:35.764 --> 00:24:45.078
TRAVIS: So, one, two-- in a straight line-- three,
four, five, six, seven, eight hundred miles, if we fly.

00:24:45.078 --> 00:24:52.058
TALIESIN: We may be sitting on this for a little
while. That's good to know, thank you, friend.

00:24:52.058 --> 00:24:57.379
MATT: "Happy to help. Wish I could be of
assistance, I could use the coin, but-- good luck."

00:24:57.379 --> 00:25:02.582
TALIESIN: Thank you, here's a couple coin for your
trouble, anyway. I throw three gold at him.

00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:08.653
MATT: Three gold, he goes, "Thank you very much!
You are very generous, thank you. Thank you all."

00:25:09.343 --> 00:25:11.234
MARISHA: What's your name, by the way?

00:25:11.234 --> 00:25:12.340
MATT: "Dreef."

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.122
MARISHA: Dreef?

00:25:13.123 --> 00:25:14.677
MATT: "Dreef. What's your name?"

00:25:14.677 --> 00:25:15.414
MARISHA: Beau.

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:16.279
MATT: "Beau."

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:18.911
MARISHA: Yeah. Like a staff.

00:25:20.326 --> 00:25:21.814
MATT: "Do you use staffs?"

00:25:22.324 --> 00:25:25.733
MARISHA: Yeah, I do, actually.
Do you sell staffs?

00:25:25.883 --> 00:25:30.089
MATT: "No, it'd be really funny if you used
them, and you do, so that's quite funny."

00:25:30.089 --> 00:25:32.852
TALIESIN: You would call that the Beau bo.

00:25:32.853 --> 00:25:33.673
MARISHA: I know.

00:25:33.673 --> 00:25:35.078
TALIESIN: Would be Beau's bo.

00:25:35.078 --> 00:25:36.937
MATT: "That is what I'm talking about."

00:25:36.937 --> 00:25:39.940
MARISHA: Are you all really just making
this connection? Really?

00:25:39.941 --> 00:25:42.353
TRAVIS: I mean, truthfully, yeah.

00:25:43.043 --> 00:25:44.728
MARISHA: Pull out my bo staff.

00:25:44.729 --> 00:25:47.089
MATT: (laughs) "Yeah."

00:25:47.089 --> 00:25:49.615
TALIESIN: You could put a bow on the bo.
On Beau's bo.

00:25:49.615 --> 00:25:52.188
TRAVIS: You could, yeah. Then it'd be
Beau-bo-bows. Bo.

00:25:52.188 --> 00:25:56.379
MATT: "Wait." He turns around and rushes off
real fast to rummage in the same cabinet and

00:25:56.379 --> 00:25:59.715
comes back with piece of ribbon, then
leans in to tie it around the bo.

00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:05.960
TRAVIS: Now that is something. Beau's bo's bow.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.292
MATT: (laughs) "You're not into this, I'm sorry."

00:26:08.292 --> 00:26:11.867
MARISHA: I put it away and I smack Fjord
in the face as I put my staff back.

00:26:11.867 --> 00:26:13.687
TRAVIS: Ugh!

00:26:13.688 --> 00:26:15.417
MARISHA: Your lip's bleeding.

00:26:15.417 --> 00:26:17.298
MATT: "The ribbon's for you, I suppose."

00:26:17.298 --> 00:26:18.357
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:26:18.357 --> 00:26:19.894
MATT: "Anyway. Have a good day!"

00:26:19.894 --> 00:26:21.178
TALIESIN: You too, as well.

00:26:21.178 --> 00:26:26.446
MATT: "Good luck." He sits down and takes his bowl
back on his lap and watches you intensely as you leave.

00:26:27.946 --> 00:26:34.273
TALIESIN: That's interesting. We have to
take care of that at some point.

00:26:34.273 --> 00:26:35.424
TRAVIS: Is it bigger?

00:26:35.424 --> 00:26:40.424
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a little poofy. Yeah. That's
a good one, man, I had good aim on that.

00:26:40.424 --> 00:26:42.574
MATT: All right. Bookshop farers!

00:26:42.574 --> 00:26:49.845
LAURA: It's this way. You just walk over here and
then you go down this street.

00:26:49.845 --> 00:26:53.132
SAM: I feel like we've walked down this
road before, at least twice.

00:26:53.132 --> 00:26:54.046
LAURA: Really?

00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:54.776
SAM: Yeah.

00:26:54.776 --> 00:26:57.980
LIAM: That is exactly what we've done. You've been
to this place before, but when you were a child?

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.471
Maybe you've forgotten the way.

00:26:59.471 --> 00:27:01.917
LAURA: Oh, I never went here, no.

00:27:03.527 --> 00:27:09.925
LIAM: Did you get out? Did your mother take you
around, or did you have maybe a babysitter?

00:27:09.925 --> 00:27:10.732
LAURA: No.

00:27:11.362 --> 00:27:12.271
SAM: Neither?

00:27:12.311 --> 00:27:13.108
LAURA: No.

00:27:13.108 --> 00:27:16.078
SAM: You were just let up to your own
devices as a small child?

00:27:16.078 --> 00:27:21.432
LAURA: No, no, no! My mom was there,
but we didn't, you know, go places.

00:27:21.432 --> 00:27:24.535
But I did see a bookstore, I swear,
from my window.

00:27:24.535 --> 00:27:31.636
MATT: About then, you pick up a visual on a
cornershop that's called Front to Back and has

00:27:31.636 --> 00:27:34.460
books hanging underneath that
on a little wooden placard.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.787
LAURA: See? This is what I was talking about, this
one right here, Front to Back.

00:27:40.317 --> 00:27:46.367
LIAM: Before we go in: you never went out, or
just rarely? You mean, just rarely went out?

00:27:46.367 --> 00:27:54.299
LAURA: I did go out sometimes, yeah. I got to go,
you know, on errands sometimes, yeah.

00:27:55.289 --> 00:27:57.997
SAM: That's fun. Did you have many friends,
growing up?

00:28:00.557 --> 00:28:03.446
LAURA: The Traveler's really cool.

00:28:04.686 --> 00:28:06.223
MARISHA: (whispering) So tragic.

00:28:06.223 --> 00:28:09.424
SAM: Oh. So you were starved for--

00:28:09.424 --> 00:28:13.583
LAURA: And Bluud! I mean, you know, that guy,
he hung out with me sometimes.

00:28:13.583 --> 00:28:14.802
SAM: The minotaur?

00:28:14.802 --> 00:28:15.634
LAURA: Yeah.

00:28:16.934 --> 00:28:18.656
SAM: That must have been fun.

00:28:18.656 --> 00:28:22.221
LAURA: It was, he let me hang on his horns.

00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:29.968
LIAM: What about just outside of the Chateau? Did
you go out to play?

00:28:31.289 --> 00:28:32.156
LAURA: No.

00:28:33.376 --> 00:28:36.158
LIAM: Well, let's see what books
they have inside here.

00:28:37.828 --> 00:28:43.021
MATT: You step inside. It's a smaller building and
there's no other customers, it's actually pretty

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:48.992
quiet in there. The only sound you hear is a
silent purring from the owner's cat. It's curled

00:28:48.992 --> 00:28:53.801
up on one of the shelves and it's (purring). As
soon as you enter and make your first creaking

00:28:53.801 --> 00:29:04.009
step against the floorboard, one eye pokes open,
(yawns), stretches out, stands up and looks at

00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:06.835
you all, and then turns around
and just walks away.

00:29:07.495 --> 00:29:09.264
LAURA: What color was the cat?

00:29:09.265 --> 00:29:15.431
MATT: Oh, the cat was a calico. All splotches of
brown, dark brown, black. Half-and-half nose.

00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:21.076
There's three shelves on the left side, the right
side is just a window, it's open and what little

00:29:21.076 --> 00:29:25.961
bit of light is in there is the daylight being let
in, it's filling the space of this warm interior.

00:29:25.961 --> 00:29:33.503
There is a desk towards the back where you see a
scrawny, scrappy-looking man in his late 30s or

00:29:33.503 --> 00:29:43.071
early 40s. His hair is combed back, slicked, but
little pieces of it are falling in front of his

00:29:43.071 --> 00:29:48.822
eyes. He has a little bit of scruff on his upper
lip, not enough to actually be considered a

00:29:48.822 --> 00:29:56.459
mustache. He glances up from a book that he's in
the middle of reading and goes, "Hello? Look

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:01.659
"around, anything you want, I'm Rusan. Anything
that you may require, let me know! Pay at the front."

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:06.612
LIAM: Before I step forward, I lean down to the
ground, snap my fingers, and bring Frumpkin the

00:30:06.612 --> 00:30:13.614
cat into existence. Telepathically say: Go,
say hello to that cat. And he scuttles off.

00:30:13.614 --> 00:30:15.112
MATT: (meows)

00:30:15.112 --> 00:30:16.625
LIAM: Russo, you said?

00:30:16.625 --> 00:30:17.625
MATT: "Rusan."

00:30:17.625 --> 00:30:27.564
LIAM: Rusan, oh. My apologies. I am looking to buy
a bit of paper. Quite a bit, but whatever you

00:30:27.564 --> 00:30:34.627
might have. Also, do you specialize in a kind of
book here, or is it a wide array? What's your

00:30:34.627 --> 00:30:37.264
specialty? What's your favorite
that you have for sale?

00:30:37.264 --> 00:30:41.878
MATT: "This is a lot of questions. Hold on." He
sits there and has to file through in his head for

00:30:41.878 --> 00:30:51.400
a second. "There is paper, of course. We have
very nice parchment for presentation, for events,

00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:58.391
"parties, invitations, if that's what you're
looking for. As far as books, we have all sorts

00:30:58.391 --> 00:31:06.991
"of it. The front shelf here is mainly discussions
on various cultural philosophies. There is also

00:31:06.991 --> 00:31:15.841
"a number of cooking manuals, if you're interested
in that. There are an entire part of fiction that

00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:23.001
"deals with fictional accounts of the various
gods, of the various Marquis, the Empire's rise.

00:31:23.001 --> 00:31:29.705
"That seems to be very popular among the visiting
crownsguard. I mean, there's a lot of things!

00:31:29.705 --> 00:31:31.899
"Are you looking for something in particular?"

00:31:31.899 --> 00:31:37.103
LIAM: History of the area, of Nicodranas itself, I
would be interested in reading. Anything you have

00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:42.486
of arcane nature, I would be especially interested
in, even if it was just histories of.

00:31:42.486 --> 00:31:48.456
MATT: "That is a bit specific, unfortunately. We
do not have anything in particular for that."

00:31:48.456 --> 00:31:52.564
LIAM: Well, I will look through your fictional
works and also history if you have it.

00:31:52.565 --> 00:31:56.739
LAURA: Do you know where we would go
to find arcane books and stuff?

00:31:56.739 --> 00:32:01.744
MATT: "I do not, unfortunately. Most of that is
organized by the guildmasters under the Marquis.

00:32:01.744 --> 00:32:09.735
"The Concord generally deals with things that are
of particular price points and interests. I mainly

00:32:09.736 --> 00:32:14.306
"deal with people who come to travel in and out,
people that want something to read when they are

00:32:14.306 --> 00:32:22.044
"going on a boat for a very long time. There's not
a lot of business to be made from the books you requested."

00:32:22.044 --> 00:32:29.724
LIAM: Okay. Well, priority one is, I deal
in prose and poetry quite a bit, so I need

00:32:29.724 --> 00:32:32.830
a good amount of basic blank paper
for my work.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.985
LAURA: He's a really good poet.

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:36.224
SAM: It all rhymes.

00:32:36.224 --> 00:32:37.294
LAURA: Mm-hmm!

00:32:37.295 --> 00:32:38.795
MATT: "Have you been published?"

00:32:39.495 --> 00:32:46.956
LIAM: I am working up the courage for that point.
I am almost ready. I just have to take that first step--

00:32:46.956 --> 00:32:50.565
LAURA: Slam poetry, right now!
Anything that comes to your mind!

00:32:50.566 --> 00:32:54.524
SAM: (vocal accompaniment)

00:32:54.524 --> 00:33:03.525
LIAM: I am pink. I sometimes stink. I need to
think. I want to get out of this store right now.

00:33:03.526 --> 00:33:09.746
SAM: And get a drink? A-wicka-record scratch!

00:33:09.746 --> 00:33:11.284
MATT: "Keep at it."

00:33:12.514 --> 00:33:15.795
LIAM: So just the paper, I suppose.

00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:23.055
MATT: "Hey." He leans forward and pats you on the
shoulder. "Everyone starts somewhere, right?"

00:33:23.055 --> 00:33:35.514
LIAM: Ooh. Now, DM question. I have that ink
from the library that can take basic-ass paper

00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:40.583
and have it serve the purpose of 500 gold
worth of that high-quality paper.

00:33:40.584 --> 00:33:41.444
MATT: Correct.

00:33:41.444 --> 00:33:45.783
LIAM: Okay. I would like to buy that
specific amount of paper. I want to--

00:33:45.794 --> 00:33:49.314
MATT: 500 gold-- I mean, to equivalent,
to fill up that much ink--

00:33:49.314 --> 00:33:52.135
LIAM: The equivalent of, which would be
much less, I assume.

00:33:52.135 --> 00:33:57.406
MATT: Correct. Yeah. He has a fair amount of
paper. Some of it, he seems to have to leave for a

00:33:57.406 --> 00:34:01.739
few minutes and then come back with it. He seems
to be going off and probably buying it from other

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:06.974
friends of his. Like the time I remember as a kid,
I ordered a cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant,

00:34:06.974 --> 00:34:10.074
and it took 30 minutes to get there,
and I realized it was because

00:34:10.074 --> 00:34:12.134
they went up the street to get it.

00:34:12.813 --> 00:34:14.663
LIAM: Yeah, we make that, yeah!

00:34:14.914 --> 00:34:19.405
MATT: I was a dumb 12-year-old. Anyway.

00:34:19.405 --> 00:34:24.819
LIAM: While he is making those trips,
I will find one interesting fictional work

00:34:24.819 --> 00:34:30.194
and also any history book on Nicodranas
that I can find.

00:34:30.194 --> 00:34:37.806
LAURA: While he's also out, I will paint
a little dick next to the front and a

00:34:37.806 --> 00:34:42.603
little booty next to the back of his sign.
Front to Back.

00:34:43.824 --> 00:34:46.825
MATT: With typical ink or magic ink?

00:34:46.824 --> 00:34:48.056
LAURA: Typical ink.

00:34:48.056 --> 00:35:02.428
MATT: Okay. Just checking. Okay! You find one
fictional piece that talks of a sailors' tryst.

00:35:02.429 --> 00:35:07.725
Two sailors, two separate ships that continuously
meet up at different island ports throughout the

00:35:07.725 --> 00:35:12.203
Swavain Islands, eventually finding themselves on
opposite sides of a conflict: one as part of the

00:35:12.204 --> 00:35:18.222
Revelry, and one that is part of the Clovis
Concord's naval fleet. Yet these two sailors

00:35:18.222 --> 00:35:25.654
eventually come together and find that this conflict
was not enough to keep their passions apart.

00:35:25.654 --> 00:35:27.084
LIAM: Edubational.

00:35:27.084 --> 00:35:31.384
MATT: You find a book about the history of
Nicodranas, and I'll email you information after

00:35:31.384 --> 00:35:33.284
the game. I don't want to sit here and--

00:35:33.284 --> 00:35:35.525
LIAM: Please don't. But I do want to have that.

00:35:35.525 --> 00:35:38.253
MATT: Yes, I'll send that to you.

00:35:38.253 --> 00:35:41.485
LAURA: I would like to buy the book
about cooking, please.

00:35:41.485 --> 00:35:46.085
MATT: "Which one? There are many types. There are
ones that focus on various ways of steaming and

00:35:46.085 --> 00:35:52.168
"spicing vegetables, from Marquet. There are ones
about the actual coastal tropical fruits that can

00:35:52.168 --> 00:35:55.887
"be prepared in a way that is more savory than
sweet. What is your preference?"

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:58.543
LAURA: Cinnamon in pastries.

00:35:58.543 --> 00:36:03.065
MATT: "A pastry book. That can be done, of course.
That will be--" He goes and looks through his

00:36:03.065 --> 00:36:08.530
ledger, goes and pulls one off of the shelf, comes
by. "This will be two silver pieces."

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.746
LAURA: Do you also have a book about mushrooms?

00:36:11.746 --> 00:36:15.902
MATT: "There are a few that contain
mushrooms, I'm sure. I can look around."

00:36:15.902 --> 00:36:17.993
LAURA: I would like one of those, thank you.

00:36:17.993 --> 00:36:20.915
MATT: "Any preference? I mean, there are--
location-wise?"

00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:24.019
LAURA: Something where you can cook the
mushrooms.

00:36:24.019 --> 00:36:29.805
MATT: "Okay, I'll pick one. All right,
that will be four silver."

00:36:29.806 --> 00:36:31.153
LAURA: You got it.

00:36:31.153 --> 00:36:38.674
MATT: "There you are. Your cinnamon pastry
and mushroom book. Enjoy."

00:36:38.675 --> 00:36:40.685
TALIESIN: Great Nicodranas Bake Off.

00:36:44.175 --> 00:36:45.447
LAURA: Thank you.

00:36:45.672 --> 00:36:50.139
MATT: "No worries. Well, good luck,
and keep it up, my friend."

00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:55.161
LIAM: Oh, what do I owe you? For all
the paper, and these two books.

00:36:55.161 --> 00:37:01.398
MATT: That's right. "Each book is two silver
pieces, so that's four silver pieces for that. For

00:37:01.398 --> 00:37:06.920
"the total amount of paper, that is going to
run you about-- we'll say 25 gold pieces."

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.107
LIAM: Excellent. Okay, so I hand that over.

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:12.142
MATT: It's a lot of paper.

00:37:13.962 --> 00:37:16.688
LIAM: Where are we going to stay tonight,
do you think?

00:37:16.688 --> 00:37:20.488
LAURA: Do you want to put that in the bag?

00:37:21.758 --> 00:37:23.337
LIAM: That would be helpful.

00:37:23.337 --> 00:37:24.247
LAURA: Here.

00:37:24.247 --> 00:37:26.816
LIAM: (paper sliding)

00:37:27.976 --> 00:37:33.450
MATT: It's like feeding an endless printer,
(paper sliding), or those dollar counter

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.210
machines that go (dull whirring).

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.949
LAURA: Oh wait, what did you ask me?

00:37:36.949 --> 00:37:38.847
SAM: Where are we sleeping tonight?

00:37:38.847 --> 00:37:41.888
LAURA: At the Lavish Chateau. Where
else would we stay?

00:37:41.888 --> 00:37:43.076
SAM: Well, I don't know--

00:37:43.076 --> 00:37:45.931
LIAM: Well, it was a little contentious
when we left, but I--

00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:47.718
LAURA: What are you talking about?

00:37:47.718 --> 00:37:50.768
SAM: Well, we hustled out of town because
we had caused a ruckus.

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:54.344
LAURA: Yeah, but we don't look like ourselves.
What difference does it make?

00:37:54.344 --> 00:37:58.052
SAM: Not for very much longer. Mine's
going to wear off in a couple of minutes.

00:37:58.052 --> 00:37:59.534
LAURA: Oh. Should we recast it?

00:37:59.534 --> 00:38:00.404
SAM: Maybe.

00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:02.411
LAURA: I recast it.

00:38:02.601 --> 00:38:04.377
SAM: I'll recast it, too.

00:38:04.377 --> 00:38:05.630
LIAM: Samesies.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.942
MATT: Mark off another level one spell slot.

00:38:09.732 --> 00:38:11.285
LAURA: Shall we go home?

00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:13.463
SAM: Sure.

00:38:13.653 --> 00:38:20.151
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;. Nott, do you want to contact the
others and let them know where--

00:38:20.151 --> 00:38:21.741
oh, they're too far away. Jester?

00:38:21.742 --> 00:38:23.690
SAM: You can contact the others.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:26.680
LAURA: That's a really high-level spell, but--

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.419
LIAM: Are you going to pick any fights
with anybody today?

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.194
SAM: We should have maybe said a place
where we would meet later.

00:38:33.194 --> 00:38:35.925
LAURA: I did, sort of, but they were
walking away.

00:38:35.925 --> 00:38:37.114
SAM: Oh, shit.

00:38:37.404 --> 00:38:48.141
LAURA: I cast Sending to Caduceus. So we're going
to my mama's house. You guys should meet us there.

00:38:48.141 --> 00:38:51.762
We're going to stay there tonight. I don't
know for sure if that's happening,

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:56.571
but I'm sure it'll be okay. Also,
we get to see Nugget again--

00:38:56.571 --> 00:39:00.912
TALIESIN: We'll meet you there and maybe talk
about tomorrow's thing. I think we're probably

00:39:00.912 --> 00:39:03.870
going to want to take a look at that tower
while we're in town.

00:39:03.871 --> 00:39:06.821
LAURA: I don't have a "you can reply
to this message," so you--

00:39:06.821 --> 00:39:08.172
TALIESIN: I said it anyway.

00:39:08.172 --> 00:39:12.317
(laughter)

00:39:12.317 --> 00:39:18.765
MATT: I love it. It's so good. As you guys finish
your business, you all eventually come and

00:39:18.765 --> 00:39:23.051
reconvene. Unless you have other business you want
to attend to while you're out and about?

00:39:23.052 --> 00:39:27.550
SAM: On the walk towards Mom's house,
is there any little patch of grass or dirt?

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:33.065
MATT: Plenty of patches of dirt. I would
say, in the streets--

00:39:33.065 --> 00:39:34.641
SAM: A park that we pass?

00:39:34.641 --> 00:39:38.252
MATT: If you go a little bit out of your way,
yes, you can find a patch of--

00:39:38.252 --> 00:39:44.504
SAM: I want to-- maybe while they were in there
shopping, I want to put my hand in the dirt,

00:39:44.504 --> 00:39:49.524
feel soil, know that I'm on solid land.

00:39:49.524 --> 00:39:54.752
MATT: As your fingers dig into the dirt and you
squeeze it and appreciate it, you glance over to

00:39:54.753 --> 00:39:58.790
the side. There's a seven-year-old boy
who's sitting there, looking at you.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:03.559
SAM: I thought I'd dropped a coin in there.
I was looking for it.

00:40:04.399 --> 00:40:08.680
MATT: He reaches down and grabs a big handful of
dirt, too, and squishes it in his fingers.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.481
SAM: It's fun.

00:40:09.481 --> 00:40:10.482
MATT: "Yeah."

00:40:10.682 --> 00:40:11.562
SAM: (mud squelch)

00:40:12.983 --> 00:40:14.274
MATT: (crying)

00:40:14.274 --> 00:40:17.613
SAM: Oh god, no. I thought we were playing!

00:40:17.613 --> 00:40:25.051
(laughter)

00:40:25.052 --> 00:40:31.965
TRAVIS: You assaulted a seven-year-old.
"I thought we were playing!"

00:40:31.978 --> 00:40:36.793
MATT: A strange little pink creature with
fairy wings just threw dirt in his eye.

00:40:37.042 --> 00:40:40.351
MARISHA: Sam attempted to have a dad moment,
and it failed.

00:40:40.351 --> 00:40:45.391
TALIESIN: I'm so excited for our next campaign. You've
already created a backstory for your next character.

00:40:45.391 --> 00:40:48.493
SAM: Yeah. (deep voice) I hate monsters.

00:40:50.073 --> 00:40:52.583
TALIESIN: Little boy with a knife.

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:55.580
TRAVIS: If it's pink, I kill it.

00:40:57.791 --> 00:41:00.313
MARISHA: It's a very unhealthy relationship
with pink.

00:41:00.313 --> 00:41:09.391
MATT: If it pinks, the knife sinks. Eventually you
guys reconvene outside of the Lavish Chateau. You

00:41:09.391 --> 00:41:14.735
see Tyral, the young man who had helped you with
your cart, but does not recognize any of you,

00:41:14.735 --> 00:41:21.374
really. Nods as you walk into the establishment.
It's still early enough where the clientele--

00:41:21.374 --> 00:41:27.832
there is no presentation. It is mainly a
relatively quiet midday dining experience. There

00:41:27.832 --> 00:41:32.236
are maybe three people in the interior, and
they're probably having business meetings. There

00:41:32.236 --> 00:41:37.633
might be merchants who are using this space as a
location away, to have more hushed conversations

00:41:37.633 --> 00:41:43.631
in a less public environment. You have arrived.
What would you like to do?

00:41:43.631 --> 00:41:47.622
LAURA: I look up into the rafters and see if
Professor Thaddeus came home.

00:41:47.622 --> 00:41:49.462
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:41:49.463 --> 00:41:52.382
MARISHA: Yes, beat me to it. Yes.

00:41:52.382 --> 00:41:55.952
LAURA: Even with a natural 20 I don't
think I would see Professor Thaddeus,

00:41:55.952 --> 00:41:58.665
but I did not roll that. I rolled a ten.

00:41:58.665 --> 00:42:01.206
MATT: You do not see Professor Thaddeus
in the rafters.

00:42:01.206 --> 00:42:04.235
LAURA: Too bad, man. That would have been
really cool, huh?

00:42:04.235 --> 00:42:05.951
MARISHA: It would have been so cool.

00:42:05.951 --> 00:42:07.415
TALIESIN: He flew the coop.

00:42:07.415 --> 00:42:08.422
TRAVIS: Shame on you.

00:42:08.422 --> 00:42:10.902
TALIESIN: That was bad. I don't feel
good about that.

00:42:10.902 --> 00:42:12.286
LAURA: I go running upstairs.

00:42:13.046 --> 00:42:17.392
MATT: I am sad-- there's a little part of me that,
when you first got that owl and you made your

00:42:17.392 --> 00:42:21.892
first animal handling check, I was hoping you
would roll a one. It would be like, "Go, do this!"

00:42:21.892 --> 00:42:26.667
(fluttering). I was praying so hard
that would happen.

00:42:26.667 --> 00:42:30.581
(laughter)

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:32.772
MATT: It would have been so on brand for Beau.

00:42:32.772 --> 00:42:34.066
MARISHA: Yeah, it would've.

00:42:34.716 --> 00:42:40.200
MATT: It just took a little longer for it happen.
You head upstairs. You make your way up the

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.933
staircase to the second floor, then make your way
up towards where your mother's room is. There, as

00:42:44.933 --> 00:42:52.341
you begin to step up the way, you hear the heavy
footfall of Bluud, who sits in the middle of the

00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:59.721
top of the staircase towards where your mother's
room is. Looks down towards you, (grunts).

00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:04.166
Leans back and folds his arms. Are the rest of
you going up with her or staying down there?

00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:05.631
SAM and TRAVIS: Sure.

00:43:05.631 --> 00:43:07.442
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, if we're all here.

00:43:07.442 --> 00:43:09.201
TRAVIS: Unless you want some privacy.

00:43:09.201 --> 00:43:10.152
LAURA: No, come!

00:43:10.152 --> 00:43:16.641
MATT: You all head up. Bluud puts his hand out, this
big meaty hand, before the others and goes: "Jester?"

00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:20.534
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:43:20.763 --> 00:43:26.884
MATT: Leans back again, his shoulders hitting
the wall as Jester does the classic

00:43:26.884 --> 00:43:30.049
international symbol for "let us through please."

00:43:30.259 --> 00:43:31.620
TRAVIS: Long established.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:35.940
MATT: Yeah. You come to the door?

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.732
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:36.732 --> 00:43:44.983
MATT: Knock on it, Nadine opens it up. Glances,
recognizes you, and goes, "Ah, right." Pulls the

00:43:44.983 --> 00:43:54.750
door open. Lounging in her fainting couch in the
far corner is your mother, with a small book open.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:59.901
Her hair is pulled and tied back tightly; she's in
her casual space. She doesn't look like she's

00:43:59.901 --> 00:44:04.752
expecting any clientele any time soon.
She glances over and looks at--

00:44:04.752 --> 00:44:07.288
LAURA: Drop it. Mama!

00:44:07.289 --> 00:44:11.152
MATT: "Jester! Oh my goodness, Jester!" She puts
the book down and sits up and runs across and

00:44:11.152 --> 00:44:15.600
picks you up with a big swinging hug.
Starts showering the top of your forehead

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.212
and cheeks with kisses and goes:
"Jester, you're back."

00:44:18.213 --> 00:44:22.361
LAURA: We're back! We're pirates.

00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:24.390
MATT: "Oh, these are your same friends?"

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:25.749
LAURA: Yes. Oh, yes.

00:44:25.749 --> 00:44:27.221
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll drop.

00:44:27.222 --> 00:44:28.659
SAM: We'll drop our disguises.

00:44:28.659 --> 00:44:34.371
MATT: "Right. Welcome back, friends, welcome back.
Thank you so much for taking care of my little sapphire."

00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:37.114
LAURA: How was the city when we left?
Was everything okay?

00:44:37.114 --> 00:44:42.750
MATT: "Everything was fine. I was a little worried
from the message that you told me, so I inquired

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:51.770
"around. There was a disturbance. Apparently
there was a ghost story, so thank you for

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:56.549
"letting me know. But now you have a ghost
story in Nicodranas."

00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:57.989
LAURA: I know! We're infamous.

00:44:57.989 --> 00:45:03.150
MATT: "Apparently. Be careful with that wording,
you guys. Best not to have too much attention.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:07.555
"Especially in this world, it can be
very dangerous."

00:45:07.555 --> 00:45:09.808
SAM: Do they know our names?

00:45:09.808 --> 00:45:17.352
MATT: "No, not what I could figure out, at least.
It was more of a marauding band of murderers on

00:45:17.352 --> 00:45:25.812
"the ship side of the docks that stole a ship, but
apparently killed a number of other illegal

00:45:25.812 --> 00:45:31.788
"peoples, and so they write it off as illegal
people doing illegal things to illegal people."

00:45:31.789 --> 00:45:32.697
LAURA: Cool.

00:45:32.747 --> 00:45:34.182
TRAVIS: I think we're good.

00:45:34.322 --> 00:45:39.011
MATT: "Just be careful. Anyway."

00:45:39.011 --> 00:45:40.429
LAURA: How's Nugget?

00:45:40.429 --> 00:45:47.783
MATT: "Oh." She goes and there's what used to be
your room, with the double doors that close. She

00:45:47.783 --> 00:45:54.969
opens it up and pulls it open. You can see all
these scratch marks on the inside of the wood. The

00:45:54.969 --> 00:46:05.567
immediate smell of dog shit and pee hits you.
"Nugget?" (whistling) All of a sudden, right there

00:46:05.567 --> 00:46:12.483
in front of you, you see Nugget, but larger. Over
the weeks that you've gone, the tiny puppy is now

00:46:12.483 --> 00:46:17.460
a fairly decent-sized puppy. Halfway to full
grown, and even that's the size of a fairly big

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:27.269
dog. Nugget (pants) and jumps up into your arms,
and you fall back onto the ground as (slurping).

00:46:27.269 --> 00:46:29.118
LAURA: This dog got big!

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.141
SAM: They do that.

00:46:30.171 --> 00:46:32.652
LAURA: Hi! Have you been training him?

00:46:32.952 --> 00:46:38.858
MATT: "I've been training him as much as I can.
He's been a bit of a handful, but is very adorable."

00:46:38.858 --> 00:46:40.151
LAURA: He's so cute!

00:46:41.861 --> 00:46:49.382
MATT: He's slobbering on the chest of your armor.
"But are you taking him?"

00:46:49.732 --> 00:46:51.288
LAURA: Yeah! Of course we are!

00:46:51.288 --> 00:46:57.499
MATT: "Wonderful! Wonderful. I am so happy to hear
that. He's missed his mommy, haven't you? Haven't you?"

00:46:57.499 --> 00:47:02.107
LAURA: I feel like he's known you longer, though.
If you're going to miss him, you know, you can--

00:47:02.108 --> 00:47:03.871
MATT: "No! No, it's quite all right."

00:47:03.881 --> 00:47:05.122
LAURA: Are you sure, Mama?

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:10.999
MATT: "He's adorable, but it is meant to be.
It is destiny, kismet. Please take him."

00:47:10.999 --> 00:47:15.294
LAURA: Okay. Can we stay here?

00:47:15.294 --> 00:47:18.578
MATT: "Of course! Of course. I mean, here?"

00:47:18.579 --> 00:47:19.759
LAURA: In the rooms.

00:47:19.759 --> 00:47:25.994
MATT: "Yeah, oh, of course. Hold on a second." She
pulls Nadine over and they talk a bit, and Nadine

00:47:26.004 --> 00:47:31.556
checks and comes back up and says that there are
only two rooms available for the evening that

00:47:31.556 --> 00:47:36.229
aren't already checked out. She goes, "If anyone
needs to, they are welcome to stay in this room as

00:47:36.229 --> 00:47:40.877
"well, and the other two are at your disposal. I
put them at my tab, do not worry."

00:47:40.877 --> 00:47:42.636
TRAVIS: Very gracious of you.

00:47:42.636 --> 00:47:44.777
TALIESIN: Two rooms ought to cover it for us.

00:47:44.777 --> 00:47:46.528
MATT: "Just for the night?"

00:47:46.528 --> 00:47:51.160
TALIESIN: How long are we going to be-- maybe just
a couple nights, maybe, at best. There's a few

00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:53.734
things we should do in town before we head--

00:47:53.734 --> 00:47:55.467
LAURA: I don't know what we're doing.

00:47:55.467 --> 00:47:59.849
LIAM: Did you want to stay for a while, though?
A few days?

00:47:59.849 --> 00:48:04.207
LAURA: I mean, I don't want to impose
or anything, you know?

00:48:04.207 --> 00:48:07.779
MATT: "It's not an imposition. I just need
to make sure that there are rooms

00:48:07.779 --> 00:48:10.500
"available for each progressive night."

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:16.018
LIAM: Pardon me. After tonight, we could find
another place, give you a day or two with your mother.

00:48:16.568 --> 00:48:17.618
LAURA: Sure.

00:48:18.558 --> 00:48:20.757
MATT: "I mean, I would not argue."

00:48:21.207 --> 00:48:24.699
LAURA: We can hang out. I know there's
stuff we need to do and stuff.

00:48:24.699 --> 00:48:27.697
Now that we're back on land, I feel better.

00:48:29.197 --> 00:48:39.438
MATT: "It is welcoming. Well, tell me,
how was your time? Apparently you

00:48:39.438 --> 00:48:43.548
"left under interesting circumstances."

00:48:43.548 --> 00:48:52.026
TRAVIS: Hurried circumstances, I think, would
sum it up. We did have to borrow a boat. A ship.

00:48:52.727 --> 00:48:54.475
LIAM: We did not bring it back.

00:48:54.475 --> 00:48:55.429
TRAVIS: That's true.

00:48:55.429 --> 00:48:59.427
LAURA: We got another boat! It's way cooler.

00:49:00.827 --> 00:49:03.097
SAM: We're giving that one to Orly, right?

00:49:03.097 --> 00:49:04.715
LAURA: But he's holding it for us.

00:49:04.715 --> 00:49:10.022
TRAVIS: We'll be landlocked for a while.
Are you familiar with Darktow Isle?

00:49:10.622 --> 00:49:15.649
MATT: "I have heard of it. There are stories,
but I have not been there, of course."

00:49:15.649 --> 00:49:19.243
TRAVIS: Your daughter was very brave. Our
adventure took us over there.

00:49:19.243 --> 00:49:22.576
MATT: "Oh, wow! Are you being serious right now?"

00:49:22.576 --> 00:49:24.728
LAURA: Serious? We're pirates! Well, we were.

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:28.215
MATT: "I had one client from Darktow once,
told me a little bit about it.

00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:30.075
"Sounds like a very frightening place."

00:49:30.075 --> 00:49:32.114
LAURA: Who was the client?

00:49:32.114 --> 00:49:33.677
MATT: "I cannot tell."

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:36.887
LAURA: Did he have hair from another guy on?

00:49:38.997 --> 00:49:40.238
MATT: "No?"

00:49:40.238 --> 00:49:42.926
LAURA: Was he bald? Was he big and bald?

00:49:43.526 --> 00:49:48.029
MATT: "No, but that doesn't narrow down my
clients, necessarily, either."

00:49:48.029 --> 00:49:50.617
LAURA: Okay, well, we only met a couple
people, so.

00:49:50.617 --> 00:49:51.932
MATT: "That's okay."

00:49:51.932 --> 00:49:55.017
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't think the Plank King
leaves very often.

00:49:55.017 --> 00:50:01.457
LAURA: He could, my mom is really,
really cool and worth traveling for.

00:50:01.767 --> 00:50:07.777
TRAVIS: Without a doubt. Our travels took
us far and wide, and we are all the more

00:50:07.777 --> 00:50:12.768
excited to be back on land and to explore
this beautiful city that most of us

00:50:12.768 --> 00:50:16.215
haven't had a chance to really peek about.

00:50:16.215 --> 00:50:19.766
LIAM: You two are very curious about that tower.

00:50:19.766 --> 00:50:21.191
TRAVIS: Very much.

00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:24.238
MARISHA: Just, you know, as a
historical landmark.

00:50:24.238 --> 00:50:28.623
SAM: Do you know that tower that gets bigger
and smaller the closer you are to it?

00:50:29.053 --> 00:50:35.162
MATT: "I assume that you're referring
to the Tidal--"

00:50:35.162 --> 00:50:36.778
SAM and MARISHA: The Tide Peak?

00:50:36.778 --> 00:50:44.772
MATT: "Tide Peak? Yes. I have not been there,
of course, but it is a mysterious place."

00:50:44.772 --> 00:50:51.113
LIAM: What have you heard about it,
for Fjord and Beau's benefit?

00:50:51.113 --> 00:50:58.933
MATT: "Well, as far as I know, there is a very
wealthy mage who lives there who is responsible

00:50:58.933 --> 00:51:12.174
"for the organization of the Open Quay, who is
kind of a hermit, from what I've heard, but is

00:51:12.174 --> 00:51:16.705
"supposedly at least looking out for the benefit
of the people who live there so as not to be

00:51:16.705 --> 00:51:25.124
"completely under the control of the monopoly
of the Concord. That's as much as I know."

00:51:26.674 --> 00:51:32.434
TRAVIS: That sounds like what we've gathered
before. Interesting. I think that's where we want

00:51:32.434 --> 00:51:38.785
to go next. You notice as you walk towards it and
walk further away, it looks like it grows and shrinks?

00:51:38.785 --> 00:51:40.057
MARISHA: Like a dick.

00:51:40.127 --> 00:51:43.797
TRAVIS: Well, I was going to say
like a telescope.

00:51:44.497 --> 00:51:50.560
LAURA: Well, then it would be like the tower
curves down sometimes and then lifts back up.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.791
You know what I mean?

00:51:53.281 --> 00:51:58.334
LIAM: Well, that's true, but I feel
there's a difference.

00:51:58.394 --> 00:52:03.029
SAM: Between dicks and buildings?

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.780
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;. The movement of it.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:07.807
LAURA: Yeah, it's different!

00:52:07.807 --> 00:52:11.575
LIAM: Of course, one is a building, &lt;i&gt;ja&lt;/i&gt;?

00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:17.187
MATT: "As an expert, I would say yes. Anyway."

00:52:17.227 --> 00:52:24.321
TRAVIS: You know it goes up and down; it doesn't
lay over on its side and shrink up and then extend itself.

00:52:24.321 --> 00:52:27.442
MARISHA: What happens in the cold?

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:31.668
MATT: "You have been at sea for quite some time,
I can tell."

00:52:31.668 --> 00:52:35.414
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. Yeah, we got sea dementia.
It's really rampant.

00:52:35.414 --> 00:52:42.501
MATT: "It is all right. Well, take your time. I
will ask to see if we can have a special dinner

00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:46.797
"prepared for you when you come back tonight,
and I'm happy to have you home."

00:52:46.797 --> 00:52:47.709
LAURA: Thank you.

00:52:47.709 --> 00:52:49.187
SAM: What time is it about now?

00:52:49.187 --> 00:52:54.180
MATT: At this point, it's later afternoon. I'd say you
probably have about another hour or so before dusk.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.508
LAURA: I don't think we should look at the tower.

00:52:56.508 --> 00:52:59.600
SAM: Let's go fucking break into it right now.
Let's go right now!

00:52:59.601 --> 00:53:02.918
LAURA: I don't think we should do that.
I used up three spells already.

00:53:02.918 --> 00:53:07.260
SAM: So what? We'll be fine! There's nothing in
there. We're just going to steal some stuff.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.740
LIAM: Can I make out, from the spine or the cover,
what book she was reading that she set down?

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.301
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:53:14.921 --> 00:53:17.252
LIAM: Books, books, books!

00:53:17.412 --> 00:53:19.236
MATT: Really, really great for the DM!

00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:20.146
LIAM: 21.

00:53:22.696 --> 00:53:30.808
MATT: Sure. It's called Hireling, because that was
the first word I saw on the back of my DM's

00:53:30.818 --> 00:53:35.623
screen. Who knows what that story's about?

00:53:38.907 --> 00:53:41.965
TRAVIS: We rip it out of her hand.
What's the first chapter say?

00:53:42.935 --> 00:53:45.278
MARISHA: It's just a Player's Handbook.

00:53:45.918 --> 00:53:52.407
MATT: The first chapter's called "Obscured Areas:
Lightly obscured has the effect of creatures--"

00:53:52.725 --> 00:53:55.428
(laughter)

00:53:55.678 --> 00:53:57.511
SAM: She's making a game system!

00:53:58.431 --> 00:54:00.278
MARISHA: What class do you play?

00:54:00.278 --> 00:54:04.658
TRAVIS: Jester makes a valid point. We actually
probably should go first thing in the morning

00:54:04.659 --> 00:54:08.397
so we're all nice and rested, and I would
enjoy a nice meal.

00:54:08.397 --> 00:54:09.098
LAURA: Yeah.

00:54:09.098 --> 00:54:13.667
MARISHA: We've got a little bit of time. We still
don't know how to get into this tower. Maybe we

00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:17.377
could do a little bit more research before
the night is out before dinner time?

00:54:17.378 --> 00:54:20.146
LAURA: Let's go scope it out. Let's go
stare at it a while.

00:54:20.146 --> 00:54:21.910
MARISHA: Ask questions? I don't know.

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:22.786
TRAVIS: I dig it.

00:54:22.786 --> 00:54:23.785
SAM: Bring the paint.

00:54:23.785 --> 00:54:26.189
LAURA: Yeah. The paint is always with me.

00:54:26.189 --> 00:54:27.979
TRAVIS: May the paint be with you.

00:54:27.979 --> 00:54:32.519
SAM: Caleb, I promise you, if we go scope
it out tonight, we are going in tonight.

00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:34.444
LIAM: I don't think that is a good idea.

00:54:34.445 --> 00:54:36.879
SAM: Have you met these people before?

00:54:37.359 --> 00:54:45.728
TALIESIN: I would definitely prefer to wait
as well. I'm a fan of taking a minute

00:54:45.728 --> 00:54:47.707
to take a look around and have a plan.

00:54:47.707 --> 00:54:53.499
LIAM: We need to dial it back a little bit.
We've been going at an 11 out of ten

00:54:53.499 --> 00:54:55.718
for a while. We need to slow down.

00:54:55.719 --> 00:55:00.312
TRAVIS: I'm sure there are some stores that might
have healing potions and other things we could

00:55:00.312 --> 00:55:07.005
stock up on before the sun goes down and they
close up, right? Might as well take a gander.

00:55:07.085 --> 00:55:12.999
Ms. Ruby, do you have any sorts of shops you might
recommend that would have stuff of that nature?

00:55:12.999 --> 00:55:19.908
MATT: "If you're looking for general shops that
have things that are useful in travels like that?

00:55:19.909 --> 00:55:27.709
"Healing potions, I don't really deal with those at
all. There is The Seafloor's Bounty in the Open

00:55:27.709 --> 00:55:34.506
"Quay. If you're planning to go by the strange dick
tower, then that is a possibility. If not there,

00:55:34.506 --> 00:55:40.749
"there is also Meandering Treasures in the
Restless Wharf is a destination of interest,

00:55:40.749 --> 00:55:43.517
"if that's what you're looking for,
odds and ends, maybe."

00:55:43.517 --> 00:55:45.165
TRAVIS: That's beautiful.

00:55:45.166 --> 00:55:49.510
MATT: "There is no specialty stores in healing
potions in Nicodranas."

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:52.786
TRAVIS: I'm sure either of those will do nicely.

00:55:52.786 --> 00:55:55.017
MATT: "All right. Good luck."

00:55:55.017 --> 00:55:57.638
TRAVIS: Shall we? A little light shopping?

00:55:58.318 --> 00:56:04.772
LAURA: Let's do it! I kiss her on the cheek.
Should we take Nugget with us as we go?

00:56:04.772 --> 00:56:05.665
SAM: Please, no.

00:56:05.665 --> 00:56:10.988
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe not into the stores with
things that break and then we have to pay for it.

00:56:10.988 --> 00:56:15.801
SAM: Also, we might be doing a covert
walk-by of this place.

00:56:15.801 --> 00:56:20.487
LAURA: Good idea. But what if Nugget could
go poof and go into it?

00:56:20.487 --> 00:56:22.130
SAM: That could definitely happen.

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:27.710
LAURA: And then we're like: Oh no, my dog! He went
in and now I have to go in too to get him out.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:28.788
SAM: That's valid.

00:56:28.788 --> 00:56:31.228
TRAVIS: He's certainly your dog, Jester.
It's your call.

00:56:32.118 --> 00:56:33.632
LAURA: Let's leave him here.

00:56:33.632 --> 00:56:36.897
TRAVIS' PHONE: I don't know how to
respond to that.

00:56:36.897 --> 00:56:39.895
MATT: You beat me to it, Siri.

00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:43.392
LIAM: What lazy roleplaying.

00:56:43.392 --> 00:56:45.109
TRAVIS: "Yes, and," bitch!

00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:52.402
(laughter)

00:56:52.402 --> 00:56:54.838
LAURA: I guess we can leave him here
for the time being.

00:56:54.838 --> 00:56:58.594
LIAM: You know, I'm going to stay here and
do a little bit of reading, so if you

00:56:58.594 --> 00:57:02.568
want me to watch your dog, I will.

00:57:02.568 --> 00:57:06.044
LAURA: Really? Do you want any company?

00:57:06.044 --> 00:57:07.218
LIAM: While I read?

00:57:07.218 --> 00:57:12.145
LAURA: Yeah. Someone to stare over your shoulder
and see what you're reading and talk to you while

00:57:12.145 --> 00:57:13.018
you're trying to--

00:57:13.018 --> 00:57:18.066
LIAM: I feel a little uncomfortable. Who are we
talking about? You?

00:57:18.066 --> 00:57:22.377
SAM: No, I don't like to be near when he reads. He
needs to focus.

00:57:22.377 --> 00:57:24.268
LAURA: Are you sure Nugget won't bother you?

00:57:24.268 --> 00:57:30.070
LIAM: No, but go, find out what you can about this
place and get your shopping done. Ask about the

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:32.287
tower. Subtly.

00:57:32.287 --> 00:57:33.350
LAURA: Do you need anything?

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:36.630
LIAM: Mm, no.

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:37.791
LAURA: Okay.

00:57:37.791 --> 00:57:39.464
MATT: (panting)

00:57:39.464 --> 00:57:55.606
LAURA: Nugget. I love you. Stay with Caleb. Don't
bamf away. Stay with him. He loves you so much.

00:57:55.606 --> 00:57:58.934
You're going to have a good time. Okay, bye!

00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:00.977
LIAM: Watch the dog. (poof)

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:05.080
MATT: The dog immediately-- they both port in
opposite directions as he ports right up next to

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:08.786
you and pushes you over.

00:58:10.906 --> 00:58:19.314
LIAM: Okay. You want to do some spell research
with me? Come on. Come on, Frumpkin.

00:58:19.333 --> 00:58:27.475
MATT: Frumpkin comes over slowly, (growling).
Frumpkin leaps up and perches around your

00:58:27.475 --> 00:58:33.595
shoulders, taking the territory and staring at
Nugget.

00:58:33.595 --> 00:58:39.705
LIAM: You are in charge. You are the guard cat.
Don't let him push you around. I start to read and write.

00:58:39.746 --> 00:58:43.678
MATT: All right. The rest of you, where are you
going?

00:58:43.678 --> 00:58:49.824
SAM: In the interest of time, are there any
potions that we find around?

00:58:49.824 --> 00:58:51.888
MATT: You have two locations you go to.

00:58:51.888 --> 00:58:53.036
TRAVIS: The Seafloor Bounty is over by the--

00:58:53.036 --> 00:58:56.366
LAURA: I think we should go to the one in the Open
Quay.

00:58:56.366 --> 00:59:02.611
MATT: Heading to the Seafloor's Bounty, it seems
to be a fairly decent general store. It

00:59:02.649 --> 00:59:08.159
specializes in pawning scavenged goods and loot
and things that are found at sea or people come

00:59:08.159 --> 00:59:14.397
upon through whatever means they come upon them
near the wharf. There is a female gnome who runs

00:59:14.397 --> 00:59:22.395
it. Older looking, the equivalent of a human 60s,
which means she's been around for quite some time,

00:59:22.396 --> 00:59:26.988
but very crotchety and nasty. As you walk in,
there's one other customer who, as soon as you

00:59:26.988 --> 00:59:32.477
enter, looks nervously and then exits immediately,
brushes past you, and disappears into the now

00:59:32.477 --> 00:59:40.352
setting sun as the gnome turns around to you.
"Yeah, can I help you?"

00:59:40.352 --> 00:59:41.167
SAM: Hello!

00:59:41.168 --> 00:59:42.072
MATT: "Hello?"

00:59:42.072 --> 00:59:42.690
SAM: Hello!

00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:43.940
MATT: "Hello!"

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.179
SAM: Is she mocking me?

00:59:45.179 --> 00:59:46.629
LAURA and TRAVIS: I don't think so.

00:59:46.629 --> 00:59:50.237
LAURA: Are we disguised still? We're not disguised
anymore.

00:59:50.237 --> 00:59:52.795
TALIESIN: Probably not. Probably it wore off.

00:59:52.795 --> 00:59:57.077
SAM: I think we need some items here. Why am I the
face of the group? Hi! We need some items. We're

00:59:57.077 --> 00:59:58.647
looking for some potions.

00:59:58.647 --> 01:00:03.446
MATT: She leans over the top to look down at your
also-tiny frame over the top. "You need potions,

01:00:03.446 --> 01:00:04.587
"you said?"

01:00:04.588 --> 01:00:08.808
SAM: Potions. I will also need some-- I was
looking for some oil.

01:00:08.808 --> 01:00:09.781
MATT: "Oil?"

01:00:09.781 --> 01:00:10.427
SAM: Some oil.

01:00:10.427 --> 01:00:13.035
MATT: "I can get you some oil, sure."

01:00:13.035 --> 01:00:16.698
SAM: All right! (increasingly shrill) And do you
have any healing potions?

01:00:16.698 --> 01:00:18.708
MATT: "Maybe."

01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:20.887
SAM: (shrilly) We've got coin!

01:00:20.887 --> 01:00:25.071
MATT: "That's the secret password! I'll be right
back."

01:00:25.071 --> 01:00:27.199
SAM: I feel like she's mocking me.

01:00:27.199 --> 01:00:28.802
TALIESIN: If anything, you're mocking her.

01:00:28.802 --> 01:00:34.593
MATT: She leaps off her stool and vanishes behind
the counter. You hear the footsteps walk away and

01:00:34.639 --> 01:00:38.356
go into a back chamber, and you're left alone on
the floor in the room for a second.

01:00:38.405 --> 01:00:39.901
LAURA: Whoa. Do we see anything cool?

01:00:39.901 --> 01:00:41.343
TALIESIN: Anything interesting on the wall?

01:00:41.343 --> 01:00:51.205
MATT: There's all sorts of interesting. Decorative
scabbards containing what you assume to be a blade

01:00:51.205 --> 01:00:58.860
decorating the walls, you can see large conch
shells and various sea trophies that were taken

01:00:58.903 --> 01:01:02.274
from people making the journey all across the
Swavain Islands.

01:01:02.274 --> 01:01:03.587
SAM: Anything shiny?

01:01:03.588 --> 01:01:06.256
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:01:06.256 --> 01:01:08.906
SAM: Eight.

01:01:08.906 --> 01:01:10.267
MATT: There's a few shiny things.

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:11.765
TALIESIN: Just for fun, Detect Magic.

01:01:11.766 --> 01:01:12.594
MATT: Okay.

01:01:12.594 --> 01:01:13.133
LAURA: Yeah.

01:01:13.133 --> 01:01:14.926
MATT: You cast Detect Magic.

01:01:14.927 --> 01:01:16.327
TALIESIN: Anything sparkly?

01:01:16.327 --> 01:01:21.885
MATT: Looking around in the room, you get some
faint magical glow or a sense from behind the

01:01:21.885 --> 01:01:25.836
counter. Nothing on display. There's probably a
reason for that.

01:01:25.836 --> 01:01:29.294
TALIESIN: That's fair. Anything behind the counter
look particularly interesting?

01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:30.908
MATT: Are you going to look over behind the
counter?

01:01:30.908 --> 01:01:31.459
TALIESIN: Yeah, I mean--

01:01:31.459 --> 01:01:32.024
LAURA: You're tall.

01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:35.359
TALIESIN: As long as I can-- I'm not going to
break a rule or anything, but yeah.

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:41.715
MATT: Okay. You glance over and look, and tucked
underneath, there is a small wooden case. It's

01:01:41.715 --> 01:01:47.735
closed currently. It looks maybe about two foot by
one foot, maybe six or seven inches high, and

01:01:47.735 --> 01:01:52.665
that's what's giving you the faint magical aura.

01:01:52.665 --> 01:01:54.477
TALIESIN: All right.

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:59.989
MATT: Okay. A few moments pass and you hear some
more footsteps come in, and another (heft) onto

01:01:59.989 --> 01:02:07.665
the stool again. She steps up and she has a small
satchel that you hear the clanking of crystal or

01:02:07.665 --> 01:02:15.212
glass on the inside. "Okay, I have three healing
potions I could muster. Is that what you want?"

01:02:15.213 --> 01:02:16.824
SAM: How much are they?

01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:17.627
MATT: "What?"

01:02:17.627 --> 01:02:21.303
SAM: (louder) How much are they?

01:02:21.303 --> 01:02:23.326
MATT: "60 gold apiece."

01:02:23.326 --> 01:02:24.805
SAM: (quietly) That fair?

01:02:24.805 --> 01:02:25.895
LAURA: I don't think so.

01:02:25.896 --> 01:02:26.906
SAM: We'll take them.

01:02:26.906 --> 01:02:29.556
MATT: "All right. Pay up!"

01:02:29.556 --> 01:02:30.215
SAM: Sure.

01:02:30.215 --> 01:02:30.975
TRAVIS: I'll buy one.

01:02:30.975 --> 01:02:33.455
SAM: Thank you. Anybody else chipping in?

01:02:33.455 --> 01:02:35.415
TALIESIN: I'll chip in for this, yeah.

01:02:35.415 --> 01:02:38.085
LAURA: I don't need them. I can heal people on my
own.

01:02:38.085 --> 01:02:39.247
SAM: You can?!

01:02:39.247 --> 01:02:39.714
LAURA: Yeah.

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:42.328
TALIESIN: I mean, we should distribute them to
other people.

01:02:42.328 --> 01:02:43.623
MARISHA: I'll chip in for one, 60 gold.

01:02:43.623 --> 01:02:45.245
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's a good point.

01:02:45.245 --> 01:02:47.747
TALIESIN: I'll chip in for-- how many do we have
now?

01:02:47.747 --> 01:02:48.337
LAURA: Three.

01:02:48.337 --> 01:02:49.596
MATT: Just the three basic potions.

01:02:49.596 --> 01:02:51.638
TALIESIN: Three basic healing potions. I'll chip
in for one.

01:02:51.638 --> 01:02:52.848
MARISHA: Yeah, let's buy them out.

01:02:52.848 --> 01:02:55.946
SAM: Do you have any flammable oils?

01:02:55.983 --> 01:02:58.147
MATT: "There's oil. How much do you need?"

01:02:58.147 --> 01:03:08.606
SAM: Enough for a larger flask. Something that I
could make a long line of oil with, if I needed to.

01:03:08.606 --> 01:03:14.227
MATT: "All right, that'll run you 40 gold
pieces."

01:03:14.227 --> 01:03:14.986
LAURA: Whoa.

01:03:14.986 --> 01:03:15.868
SAM: I'll take it!

01:03:15.869 --> 01:03:20.378
MATT: "All right!" She jumps off the stool, and
this takes a while. You start hearing heavy

01:03:20.378 --> 01:03:25.197
clanging of metal and things dropping in the back.
You glance around the corner and there's a slight

01:03:25.197 --> 01:03:33.317
curtain, and it looks like she's just emptying out
lanterns into a vial. Just pouring one after

01:03:33.317 --> 01:03:42.325
another, after another into this small jug, and
eventually corking it. Comes out, "Careful, now!"

01:03:42.325 --> 01:03:45.234
SAM: Thank you.

01:03:45.235 --> 01:03:46.608
MATT: "You're welcome. Thank you."

01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:47.742
SAM: What is your name again?

01:03:47.742 --> 01:03:48.681
MATT: "Sheila."

01:03:48.681 --> 01:03:49.876
SAM: Sheila.

01:03:49.876 --> 01:03:51.788
MATT: "Sheila Bobsnopper."

01:03:51.788 --> 01:03:53.350
SAM: Sheila Plobs--

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:55.476
MATT: "Bobsnopper."

01:03:55.476 --> 01:03:58.823
SAM: Bobsnopper.

01:03:58.823 --> 01:04:00.728
TALIESIN: Miss Sheila, I had a question.

01:04:00.728 --> 01:04:02.337
MATT: "What's your question?"

01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:10.534
TALIESIN: I was curious about any magical items
you might have for sale. I got a vibe that you

01:04:10.534 --> 01:04:12.649
might have something here that might be
interesting.

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:14.172
MATT: "Nothing for sale, sorry."

01:04:14.172 --> 01:04:16.972
TALIESIN: Do you have anything that's not for
sale, that's just for show?

01:04:16.972 --> 01:04:19.305
MATT: "Not for show!"

01:04:19.345 --> 01:04:21.417
LAURA: What do you have that's secret?

01:04:21.418 --> 01:04:22.638
MATT: "None of your business!"

01:04:22.638 --> 01:04:26.822
LAURA: (gasps) Okay.

01:04:26.822 --> 01:04:31.386
MATT: "Trust me, you don't want to be the kind of
person that comes in here and gets a chance to see it."

01:04:31.386 --> 01:04:33.261
LAURA: Oh, it's a weapon.

01:04:33.261 --> 01:04:34.609
MATT: "Maybe."

01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:38.970
LAURA: Is it a wand?

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:41.540
MATT: "I don't play this game, missy!"

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:42.654
TALIESIN: Is that a yes or no on the--

01:04:42.654 --> 01:04:44.389
MATT: "Are you casing my joint?"

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:45.500
LAURA: Hmm?

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.920
MATT: "I said, are you casing my joint?"

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.880
LAURA: What?

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.525
MATT: "What?"

01:04:48.525 --> 01:04:49.206
LAURA: Huh?

01:04:49.206 --> 01:04:51.709
MATT: "Are you--" (grunt)

01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:52.725
TALIESIN: What is casing?

01:04:52.725 --> 01:04:55.035
SAM: Do you buy things as well, ma'am?

01:04:55.035 --> 01:04:57.169
MATT: "Yes, I do. What, do you have something to
sell?"

01:04:57.169 --> 01:05:02.261
SAM: I have some studded leather armor that I
don't need any more.

01:05:02.261 --> 01:05:05.999
MATT: "Oh! Show it to me."

01:05:05.999 --> 01:05:12.542
SAM: All right, get it out of the haversack.
Here's some old studded armor. Studded leather.

01:05:12.665 --> 01:05:16.954
MATT: She reaches down and takes a cloth, and
starts cleaning off the bits of grime and stuff on

01:05:16.954 --> 01:05:23.028
it. Takes a few minutes to inspect it, the
interior, seeing how it fits together and belts.

01:05:23.028 --> 01:05:32.508
"That's a good set, not too bad. For sale..." Let
me look at the price here. (singing) Studded

01:05:32.508 --> 01:05:34.011
leather armor.

01:05:34.012 --> 01:05:36.394
SAM: Says 45 on-- That's new, though.

01:05:36.394 --> 01:05:38.633
MATT: "I'll give you 15 gold for it."

01:05:38.633 --> 01:05:39.759
SAM: I'll take it.

01:05:39.759 --> 01:05:41.429
LAURA: (groans)

01:05:41.429 --> 01:05:43.014
MATT: "All right, here you go."

01:05:43.014 --> 01:05:44.365
LAURA: Ugh, it hurts me.

01:05:44.365 --> 01:05:49.317
MATT: So you take 15 gold back. She goes and
throws it in a pile in the corner. "Is that it?

01:05:49.318 --> 01:05:52.905
"Anything else?" She narrows her eyes at you.

01:05:52.905 --> 01:05:57.121
LAURA: (grumpily) No. Nothing else.

01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:59.177
MATT: Narrows even harder at you.

01:05:59.177 --> 01:06:01.763
LAURA: I don't think she likes us, Caduceus.

01:06:01.763 --> 01:06:06.741
TALIESIN: That's nonsense, we're very likeable. Is
there something in your eyes? Do you have a

01:06:06.742 --> 01:06:08.614
problem, I can--

01:06:08.614 --> 01:06:10.093
LAURA: Are you tired? Are you falling--

01:06:10.093 --> 01:06:14.643
MATT: "I'm always tired! I'm just tired of you
coming in here being nosy! Get your friends out.

01:06:14.643 --> 01:06:17.015
"I like you. You, you can all piss off!"

01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:19.924
TALIESIN: This is why you did the talking. Have a
nice day.

01:06:19.925 --> 01:06:21.538
SAM: We chose wisely.

01:06:21.538 --> 01:06:22.888
MATT: "Bye, bye!"

01:06:22.888 --> 01:06:30.676
SAM: Nice to meet you, whatever, bye-bye! I liked
her, she was nice.

01:06:30.676 --> 01:06:32.692
TRAVIS: A real spitfire.

01:06:32.692 --> 01:06:35.027
SAM: She was great. Bobsnopper?

01:06:35.151 --> 01:06:37.653
LAURA: Bobstomper.

01:06:37.653 --> 01:06:39.120
MATT: Bobsnopper.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.127
TRAVIS: I got a feeling she had more fight in her
than you'd think.

01:06:41.128 --> 01:06:43.473
LAURA: Yeah. I bet she could do some damage.

01:06:43.621 --> 01:06:47.014
TRAVIS: So before the sun goes all the way down--

01:06:47.014 --> 01:06:49.918
LAURA: We're going to sneak into her shop and
steal what's behind the counter?

01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:52.359
TRAVIS: I was going to say let's go look at the
tower.

01:06:52.359 --> 01:06:54.542
LAURA: Yeah, all right.

01:06:54.542 --> 01:06:56.254
SAM: We could probably kill her.

01:06:56.254 --> 01:07:01.323
MATT: I love the prospect of you finally coming
back to Nicodranas and immediately just fucking

01:07:01.323 --> 01:07:02.987
everything up again.

01:07:02.987 --> 01:07:04.582
TRAVIS: Everything's chill.

01:07:04.582 --> 01:07:05.891
MARISHA: Two hours.

01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:07.155
MATT: Do what you want, mind you.

01:07:07.155 --> 01:07:12.342
TALIESIN: Finally calmed down, everything's fine.
This is a holdup! Empty your wallets!

01:07:12.342 --> 01:07:15.775
MATT: Why not embrace destiny?

01:07:15.775 --> 01:07:19.801
TRAVIS: Let's make our way over to the, what was
it?

01:07:19.801 --> 01:07:23.239
MARISHA: The Wayfarer's Cove-- The Open Quay.

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.846
LAURA: We're in the Open Quay.

01:07:25.846 --> 01:07:28.099
SAM: The Tide Peak. The tower, right?

01:07:28.099 --> 01:07:31.999
MATT: Yeah. Easy to find, the tower is visible. By
now, at this point in time, the sun is in the

01:07:31.999 --> 01:07:38.475
process of setting, so the sky has transitioned
now into its vibrant oranges and reds, and across

01:07:38.476 --> 01:07:44.944
the way on the other side of the horizon the dark
blues and purples are starting to take. But there

01:07:44.944 --> 01:07:53.909
it is, the dark shadow of the monolithic tower of
Tide Peak, visible. The closer you get, the taller

01:07:53.909 --> 01:08:00.207
it becomes, and the taller it becomes, until what
looks to be maybe hundreds of floors up. It's

01:08:00.207 --> 01:08:03.388
absurd how tall it looks from the base floor.

01:08:03.388 --> 01:08:05.274
LAURA: How wide is it, though?

01:08:05.274 --> 01:08:10.489
MATT: I'd say it's maybe no more than 50 feet
across, 50 feet wide.

01:08:10.489 --> 01:08:12.678
SAM: Fjord?

01:08:12.678 --> 01:08:14.234
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm?

01:08:14.235 --> 01:08:18.791
SAM: Don't you have an ability where you can
disappear and reappear a few feet somewhere else?

01:08:18.791 --> 01:08:20.927
TRAVIS: Sure do.

01:08:20.926 --> 01:08:24.752
SAM: Could you not do that and just be quickly
inside?

01:08:24.752 --> 01:08:26.831
LAURA: What if you get stuck?

01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:31.183
TRAVIS: If I look up, is that balcony that we saw
before about 15, 20 feet above our heads?

01:08:31.183 --> 01:08:34.178
MATT: That balcony is not visible.

01:08:34.178 --> 01:08:37.618
MARISHA: What do you mean? It's not there
anymore?

01:08:37.618 --> 01:08:38.987
MATT: Yeah.

01:08:38.987 --> 01:08:40.683
MARISHA: Did we do that?

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:43.926
TRAVIS: Did what? Make it appear? And disappear?

01:08:43.926 --> 01:08:47.783
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:08:47.783 --> 01:08:56.001
TRAVIS: Do a quick speed round, and we walk around
the perimeter looking out for fucking windows and

01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:58.195
balconies and we meet around the other side.

01:08:58.194 --> 01:09:01.845
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you go around, and where the
balcony was last time, there's nothing. It's

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:08.031
solid. In fact, there are no windows for about 60
or so feet up, and then you see a balcony similar

01:09:08.031 --> 01:09:11.157
to the one you saw, but it is shorter, like
truncated on each side.

01:09:11.157 --> 01:09:13.596
TRAVIS: Oh. How high up?

01:09:13.595 --> 01:09:15.352
MATT: About 50 or 60 feet up.

01:09:15.353 --> 01:09:24.077
TRAVIS: 50 to 60. Yeah, that's too high. I mean, I
can get up there, but it makes a real big noise.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:31.090
SAM: But you could just disappear and reappear
inside the wall, couldn't you?

01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:33.135
TRAVIS: I mean, I don't know what's inside there.

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:35.521
MARISHA: Yeah, could you get stuck?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:41.192
TRAVIS: Yep, and it would hurt a lot, I imagine.
Just from my simple knowledge of basic physics.

01:09:41.192 --> 01:09:43.446
SAM: I'm just a caveman.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.075
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:09:45.075 --> 01:09:47.541
SAM: All right.

01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:50.014
MARISHA: No doors, nothing.

01:09:50.014 --> 01:09:55.442
TRAVIS: But hey, there's nothing that says if we
come back in the morning, that son of a bitch

01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:59.429
might be in a different place, I'll bet you,
crackfire, slopdolly.

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:02.397
SAM: What?!

01:10:02.397 --> 01:10:04.278
TALIESIN: I don't even...

01:10:04.278 --> 01:10:06.953
(laughter)

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.652
SAM: Hick queens?

01:10:08.652 --> 01:10:09.912
TRAVIS: (spits)

01:10:09.912 --> 01:10:11.568
MATT: Dimplewood!

01:10:11.568 --> 01:10:13.844
TRAVIS: Yeah! Pick wood!

01:10:13.844 --> 01:10:21.184
MARISHA: I get this feeling that this is all a
forced perspective thing, like an illusion. What

01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:25.652
if we get in there and it's actually just a
shack?

01:10:25.652 --> 01:10:29.019
TRAVIS: There's no way. That's not possible.

01:10:29.019 --> 01:10:30.829
MARISHA: Maybe he's an enthusiast of tiny homes.

01:10:30.829 --> 01:10:34.638
TRAVIS: And it just looks like it grows and
shrinks and grows and shrinks?

01:10:34.638 --> 01:10:38.327
MARISHA: Compensating.

01:10:38.327 --> 01:10:40.297
TRAVIS: Maybe.

01:10:40.297 --> 01:10:44.119
MARISHA: I don't know. Just a theory.

01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:51.144
TRAVIS: I can't get up there without making a real
loud ruckus, so tomorrow morning's our best bet.

01:10:51.145 --> 01:10:52.887
SAM: Jester could get us up there.

01:10:52.887 --> 01:10:59.236
LIAM: I'm not here, but just out of curiosity: The
change in size, is it slight, that you just barely

01:10:59.236 --> 01:11:01.702
notice it, or is it like, "Whoa, whoa!"

01:11:01.702 --> 01:11:06.086
MATT: It's, "Whoa, whoa!" unless you're watching
it the whole time. So it's like, "Oh, we'll head

01:11:06.086 --> 01:11:07.885
"that way," and you walk, and all of a sudden
you're at the base and you look up and you're

01:11:07.885 --> 01:11:11.791
like, "Whoa, why is it so tall?" If you're
watching it, which I imagine you probably were, as

01:11:11.791 --> 01:11:21.598
you were heading through the Open Quay, it's
pretty immediate, meaning within about 500 feet or

01:11:21.598 --> 01:11:26.235
so the transition really hits. From any distance
in the city it just looks like any other large

01:11:26.235 --> 01:11:32.490
tower, though it looks like one of the more
visible and apparent ones across the skyline. It

01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:36.702
isn't until you get within 500 feet that all of a
sudden it drastically seems to grow.

01:11:36.702 --> 01:11:40.326
LIAM: So its impressiveness is in the extreme when
you're right there with it.

01:11:40.326 --> 01:11:41.712
MATT: Correct.

01:11:41.712 --> 01:11:43.299
LIAM: Okay.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.945
SAM: Caduceus has a tree.

01:11:45.977 --> 01:11:47.327
TRAVIS: What about the tree?

01:11:47.327 --> 01:11:55.443
LAURA: What about Blink? Oh, that's fucking hot
when you put a hot thing in it! Ow!

01:11:55.443 --> 01:12:01.260
MATT: Metal is funny when it conducts heat. Oh
Laura, you okay?

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.577
LAURA: Yeah, I'm fine.

01:12:02.577 --> 01:12:03.887
TRAVIS: What about the tree?

01:12:03.887 --> 01:12:05.379
SAM: Caduceus, don't you have a magic tree?

01:12:05.379 --> 01:12:06.989
TALIESIN: Am I there?

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.021
MATT: I mean, unless you haven't gone with them.

01:12:09.021 --> 01:12:11.888
TALIESIN: I was trying to remember if we'd split
for the two-- I do have a magic tree.

01:12:11.888 --> 01:12:13.654
TRAVIS: But how does that work?

01:12:13.654 --> 01:12:17.974
TALIESIN: I drop it on the ground and a 60-foot
tree immediately appears.

01:12:17.974 --> 01:12:19.208
TRAVIS: Immediately?

01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:20.058
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:12:20.058 --> 01:12:21.165
LAURA: Wouldn't that be a bit obvious?

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:22.219
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:12:22.219 --> 01:12:27.589
SAM: Not if we ride it up to the top, then leave
someone behind to chop it down real quick.

01:12:27.589 --> 01:12:29.894
TALIESIN: It's a five foot thick, tall tree.

01:12:29.894 --> 01:12:31.222
TRAVIS: That's a shitty plan.

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:33.009
MARISHA: I mean, what do we want out of this,
right?

01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:34.601
SAM: To be inside.

01:12:34.601 --> 01:12:38.357
MARISHA: Yeah, but then what? To immediately be
arrested and thrown out of Nicodranas?

01:12:38.357 --> 01:12:39.566
SAM: Profit!

01:12:39.566 --> 01:12:42.655
TRAVIS: Well, there's no rule that says don't ride
up a tree and jump on a fucking balcony.

01:12:42.655 --> 01:12:47.250
MARISHA: No, there definitely is. It's called
breaking and entering. There is a rule about that.

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:48.950
LAURA: Can't we just knock on the door?

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:50.459
TRAVIS and SAM: There's no door.

01:12:50.459 --> 01:12:52.108
LAURA: Can't we just knock on the wall?

01:12:52.108 --> 01:12:53.490
TRAVIS: Try it.

01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:54.272
LAURA: I did.

01:12:54.272 --> 01:12:55.894
MATT: Okay, you knock on the wall.

01:12:55.895 --> 01:12:57.184
LAURA: Uh-huh.

01:12:57.184 --> 01:12:59.208
MARISHA: What's it sound like?

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.513
MATT: It sounds like you're knocking on hard
stone, and it hurts your knuckle a little bit.

01:13:02.599 --> 01:13:06.841
TRAVIS: Can I turn around and look at the
storefront-- Unless something happens when she knocks.

01:13:06.975 --> 01:13:09.199
MATT: At the moment, nothing.

01:13:09.199 --> 01:13:16.003
TRAVIS: I turn around and look at the storefronts.
Are there any that are obviously still open? Right

01:13:16.003 --> 01:13:18.692
across from, maybe that are facing the...

01:13:18.692 --> 01:13:29.918
MATT: There is one that looks to be a small fish
market. It's not huge by any means, it looks like

01:13:29.918 --> 01:13:32.361
it's open, but it's probably going to be closing
fairly soon, probably when the sun goes--

01:13:32.361 --> 01:13:35.166
TRAVIS: Can I just jog over and try and find
somebody that might be working a desk over there?

01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:39.214
TALIESIN: While he does that, I'm going to just
walk the tower with my hand on the tower and see

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:42.388
if I feel any change at all.

01:13:42.388 --> 01:13:52.524
MATT: As you're doing that, you hear a door (creaking)
on the opposite side on the tower.

01:13:52.524 --> 01:13:56.025
MARISHA: (sound of running feet) Walking casual.

01:13:56.025 --> 01:14:07.150
MATT: All right. As you hear it slowly open up,
this little hand curls around the outside. Short,

01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:19.400
maybe around knee-height for you, Fjord. As the
door peeks open, you see a male goblin, really

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:26.458
well dressed, in a tiny little accountant's outfit,
where it's double-breasted to one side

01:14:26.458 --> 01:14:37.482
with a nice lapel. Has small spectacles across the
bulbous and pointed nose. No hair. The

01:14:37.483 --> 01:14:43.532
teeth-- which characteristically of a goblin tend
to overlap and protrude-- have been really

01:14:43.532 --> 01:14:52.991
well-kept. Very well-groomed goblin! Pokes around
the corner, "Hello?"

01:14:53.359 --> 01:14:55.864
LAURA: Hi!

01:14:55.864 --> 01:14:57.272
MARISHA: Hello.

01:14:57.272 --> 01:14:58.983
MATT: "Can I help you?"

01:14:58.983 --> 01:15:00.690
LAURA: Can he help us?

01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:02.750
TALIESIN: We were hoping to make an appointment
with--

01:15:02.751 --> 01:15:07.875
MARISHA: With Yussa. Yussa Errenis. It would be
really fantastic to talk to him.

01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:11.211
MATT: "Do you have an appointment?"

01:15:11.211 --> 01:15:13.164
SAM: We were going to make one.

01:15:13.164 --> 01:15:17.585
MARISHA: Yes. Or at least if you can inform us how
to make an appointment.

01:15:17.585 --> 01:15:23.694
MATT: He relaxes a second after the chest is
puffed up, his presentation relaxes and the

01:15:23.694 --> 01:15:27.751
gut (puffing) underneath the outfit as he no
longer feels that he needs to put on a

01:15:27.751 --> 01:15:33.940
presentation. He goes, "Well, let me take a
look at the book. Hold on just a second."

01:15:34.038 --> 01:15:35.794
He closes the door behind him.

01:15:35.795 --> 01:15:38.044
LAURA: Can we still see the door?

01:15:38.044 --> 01:15:41.182
MATT: You can see the door, yeah. It wasn't there
when you walked around previously.

01:15:41.182 --> 01:15:43.675
MARISHA: Maybe it's his assistant.

01:15:43.676 --> 01:15:45.433
LAURA: What does the door look like?

01:15:45.433 --> 01:15:52.756
MATT: It looks like a standard door. It's circular
at the top. It looks like it's wood slats, metal

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:59.196
crossbars hold it all together. There's no handle
or knocker. It appears to only open from the inside.

01:15:59.196 --> 01:16:00.999
LAURA: Whoa.

01:16:00.999 --> 01:16:05.239
TRAVIS: What knockers! Young Frankenstein, just to
be clear.

01:16:05.239 --> 01:16:16.705
MATT: Oh yeah. A few moments pass. The door
opens up again and he has a tiny leather journal

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:29.228
and he, "All right, soonest that we've got here--" pulls
it back, "The soonest we've got here-- let's see,

01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:36.354
"about 17 months, three weeks, and four days."

01:16:36.354 --> 01:16:40.840
TALIESIN: Is it possible to maybe move that up
into a very quick emergency meeting?

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.088
MATT: "What's the emergency?"

01:16:43.088 --> 01:16:46.563
TALIESIN: We have to leave town and will not back
for quite a while.

01:16:46.563 --> 01:16:48.373
LAURA: Yeah.

01:16:48.373 --> 01:16:51.168
MATT: "Well, come back in a number of months--"

01:16:51.168 --> 01:16:53.183
TALIESIN: It's time sensitive.

01:16:53.184 --> 01:16:55.418
LAURA: We could all be dead.

01:16:55.418 --> 01:17:01.085
MATT: Make a persuasion check. Actually, no, make
a deception check because this is--

01:17:01.085 --> 01:17:04.099
TALIESIN: I have genuine questions for this
person.

01:17:04.099 --> 01:17:08.383
MATT: But you're pushing that this is an
emergency. Do you consider it an emergency?

01:17:08.383 --> 01:17:13.934
TALIESIN: For the things I want? Okay, I'm
boasting a little. Deception, right?

01:17:13.934 --> 01:17:16.599
MATT: I'm going to call you on that.

01:17:16.599 --> 01:17:17.933
TALIESIN: All right, that's fair.

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:19.357
LAURA: I'm boasting a little.

01:17:19.357 --> 01:17:21.096
TALIESIN: Eight?

01:17:21.096 --> 01:17:24.380
MATT: (mistrustful noise)

01:17:24.381 --> 01:17:26.803
TALIESIN: Does the Blooming Grove mean anything?

01:17:26.803 --> 01:17:28.648
MATT: "Not to me."

01:17:28.648 --> 01:17:32.020
LAURA: But it might to the dude you work for.

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:36.519
MARISHA: Listen. I'm sure you've heard about the
war that's happening in the Empire?

01:17:36.832 --> 01:17:38.379
MATT: "Yes?"

01:17:38.379 --> 01:17:46.565
MARISHA: We have reason to believe that people
with magical interests might be threatened in this

01:17:46.565 --> 01:17:54.339
time of war and having heard that "Ooh-sah" might
be a man magical prowess, we thought that he might

01:17:54.339 --> 01:17:58.309
have some information or at least we could hand
off our fair warning?

01:17:58.309 --> 01:18:08.792
MATT: "I'll tell you what, &lt;i&gt;Yu&lt;/i&gt;ssa has bedded down
for the evening. You want to come by tomorrow

01:18:08.792 --> 01:18:14.181
"morning, maybe he's in a particularly good mood
and could spare you a minute or two of his time,

01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:25.486
"but as of right now I cannot force a meeting at
dusk with a few unknowns with no particular truth

01:18:25.486 --> 01:18:37.744
"to their purpose wanting to bypass our entire
system of entry. So have a good night and hope for

01:18:37.744 --> 01:18:39.316
"a better tomorrow."

01:18:39.316 --> 01:18:40.548
MARISHA: What was your name?

01:18:40.548 --> 01:18:42.119
MATT: Door closes.

01:18:42.119 --> 01:18:43.764
MARISHA: Tomorrow morning.

01:18:43.765 --> 01:18:45.855
TRAVIS: I'm at the fish mart.

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:47.032
MATT: Yep.

01:18:47.033 --> 01:18:48.726
SAM: What?

01:18:48.726 --> 01:18:49.925
TRAVIS: I'm at the fish mart.

01:18:49.926 --> 01:18:52.634
SAM: Oh, jesus!

01:18:52.634 --> 01:18:54.573
TALIESIN: With an axe in your hand going, "Who are
you?!"

01:18:54.573 --> 01:19:01.415
MATT: The fishmonger at the fish mart right now
is going like, "I know, it's fucking weird, right?

01:19:01.415 --> 01:19:03.479
"It scares me. I don't like it."

01:19:03.479 --> 01:19:10.016
TRAVIS: You don't see a particular door that
appears every couple of days or is there a pattern?

01:19:10.016 --> 01:19:13.531
MATT: "Yeah. It does when they come in and out, but
then it's gone. It's really creepy. I don't like it."

01:19:13.532 --> 01:19:19.943
TRAVIS: Yeah, all right. You're an observant one.
Anything else that you can share that might help

01:19:19.943 --> 01:19:22.515
me understand this structure more?

01:19:22.813 --> 01:19:25.535
LAURA: (coos) What does the guy look like? (coos)

01:19:25.535 --> 01:19:31.162
TRAVIS: Pigeons! Really unsanitary for these
fish.

01:19:31.162 --> 01:19:37.291
MATT: "I want to help you. I can say that there is
a very nice special on red snapper."

01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:39.120
TRAVIS: How much?

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:42.128
MATT: "Well, for the entire fish, we're looking at
least three silver."

01:19:42.128 --> 01:19:44.530
TRAVIS: I'll flip him four silver.

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:48.445
MATT: "Well, there you are." It's a sizable
snapper.

01:19:48.445 --> 01:19:51.880
TALIESIN: To be fair, you probably haven't had
meat in quite a while because I haven't been

01:19:51.881 --> 01:19:53.151
cooking it.

01:19:53.151 --> 01:19:55.144
TRAVIS: Wrapped in the paper stuff, right? Or is
it just the fish?

01:19:55.144 --> 01:19:57.743
MATT: "For the extra silver, you get paper."

01:19:57.743 --> 01:19:59.898
TRAVIS: Oh. Thank you.

01:19:59.898 --> 01:20:01.236
MATT: Wraps it up for you.

01:20:01.236 --> 01:20:04.173
TRAVIS: Very appreciative. You have yourself a
fancy fucking evening.

01:20:04.173 --> 01:20:09.737
MATT: At this point, the door is closed and you
guys look back and Fjord approaches holding a fish.

01:20:09.737 --> 01:20:12.553
TRAVIS: Success!

01:20:12.553 --> 01:20:14.840
LAURA: Oh good!

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.415
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a red snapper. Anybody a fan?

01:20:16.415 --> 01:20:18.005
LAURA: Mom loves it.

01:20:18.005 --> 01:20:19.294
TRAVIS: Oh good.

01:20:19.294 --> 01:20:21.151
SAM: You missed a bunch.

01:20:21.151 --> 01:20:23.012
MARISHA: Yeah, it turns out you could just knock.

01:20:23.012 --> 01:20:24.800
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

01:20:24.801 --> 01:20:27.263
MARISHA: We talked to a little goblin accountant
dude. Made an appointment for tomorrow morning,

01:20:27.263 --> 01:20:28.394
but not really an appointment, an off-the-books
appointment.

01:20:28.394 --> 01:20:33.351
TRAVIS: Haven't we been through enough that the
jokes are unnecessary at this point?

01:20:33.351 --> 01:20:38.373
SAM: No, it's true, but we need to figure out how
we're going to talk our way into this place tomorrow.

01:20:38.373 --> 01:20:40.442
LAURA: You should have said something, Nott.

01:20:40.443 --> 01:20:44.131
SAM: I tried but the little guy got away before I
spoke--

01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:46.289
TRAVIS: What little guy?

01:20:46.289 --> 01:20:50.684
SAM: There was a little goblin guy. Which, by the
way, none of you should trust.

01:20:50.685 --> 01:20:53.400
LAURA: But why?

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.128
SAM: He will turn around and stab you in the back
the second you're not looking.

01:20:56.128 --> 01:20:57.129
LAURA: Why will he do that?

01:20:57.129 --> 01:21:00.876
SAM: Because he's a goblin.

01:21:00.877 --> 01:21:03.162
TRAVIS: I grab the snapper by the tail and I start
gesturing. Let me get this straight. I went to ask

01:21:03.162 --> 01:21:08.595
questions, you knocked, and some goblin came out
of what, the balcony and started answering your

01:21:08.595 --> 01:21:10.397
questions and then disappeared.

01:21:10.397 --> 01:21:12.212
SAM: The front door. Can't you see it right
there?

01:21:12.212 --> 01:21:14.790
TRAVIS: Is it still there?

01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:17.258
MATT: At this point, as you guys are all talking
and you look back, the door is not there anymore.

01:21:17.258 --> 01:21:22.910
TRAVIS: You motherfuckers. I don't need this shit.
I toss it like SeaWorld.

01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:27.632
MARISHA: Toss it like SeaWorld!

01:21:27.632 --> 01:21:30.911
SAM: (dolphin squeaking)

01:21:30.911 --> 01:21:35.311
LAURA: Oh, save that paper. Caleb will want it.

01:21:35.311 --> 01:21:37.181
SAM: Oh yes.

01:21:37.181 --> 01:21:39.259
TRAVIS: Ducey! Did this happen?

01:21:39.259 --> 01:21:40.542
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:21:40.542 --> 01:21:41.624
TRAVIS: Really?

01:21:41.624 --> 01:21:42.505
TALIESIN: Really.

01:21:42.505 --> 01:21:44.340
TRAVIS: And you just knocked and a door appeared?

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.631
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:21:45.631 --> 01:21:48.694
MARISHA: Sorry, it shouldn't have come out of my
mouth. It's inherently untrustworthy.

01:21:48.694 --> 01:21:50.600
TALIESIN: I don't know, I liked it.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.884
LAURA: That is not true, Beau.

01:21:51.884 --> 01:21:54.221
TRAVIS: It just seemed so fantastic.

01:21:54.221 --> 01:22:00.661
MARISHA: Yeah, honestly it was the path of least
resistance that surprised me as well. I'm used to

01:22:00.662 --> 01:22:03.691
things being difficult. Maybe I just make things
difficult.

01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:05.665
TRAVIS: No, I don't think that's it.

01:22:05.665 --> 01:22:07.774
MARISHA: Maybe I'm having a moment of
self-realization.

01:22:07.774 --> 01:22:09.729
TRAVIS: Let's not do that.

01:22:09.729 --> 01:22:12.875
TALIESIN: Ride it. I approve of this. This is
great.

01:22:12.875 --> 01:22:14.036
MARISHA: Anyway.

01:22:14.036 --> 01:22:16.347
TRAVIS: So we come back in the morning--

01:22:16.347 --> 01:22:19.054
SAM: We're going to need some information to give
to get in.

01:22:19.055 --> 01:22:20.648
TRAVIS: What information?

01:22:20.648 --> 01:22:24.489
SAM: I don't know. Something that would make a
powerful mage want to talk to us. We need to know

01:22:24.489 --> 01:22:25.873
a magical secret--

01:22:25.873 --> 01:22:26.776
TRAVIS: Uk'otoa.

01:22:26.776 --> 01:22:30.049
SAM: Or talk to him about Uk'otoa--

01:22:30.049 --> 01:22:31.604
MARISHA: We have a ton of magical secrets.

01:22:31.604 --> 01:22:33.761
LAURA and MARISHA: We also have the dodecahedron.

01:22:33.761 --> 01:22:35.983
MARISHA: We have the Happy Fun Time Ball.

01:22:35.983 --> 01:22:38.315
LAURA: Oh my gosh, the Happy Fun Time Ball!

01:22:38.315 --> 01:22:42.688
MARISHA: We witnessed an attack on another
wizard's tower in Zadash. I wasn't lying when I

01:22:42.689 --> 01:22:47.042
said magic people might be under attack.

01:22:47.098 --> 01:22:49.373
SAM: That's true. These are all truths.

01:22:49.373 --> 01:22:50.776
MARISHA: I know!

01:22:50.776 --> 01:22:54.943
LAURA: What if-- You know how all these things
were stolen from people?

01:22:54.943 --> 01:22:56.427
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

01:22:56.427 --> 01:22:58.768
LAURA: What if maybe they were stolen from this
guy?

01:22:58.769 --> 01:23:02.220
TRAVIS: We walk in and we say, "Are you missing
anything?"

01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:05.546
LAURA: But then we'll have to give it back to
him.

01:23:05.546 --> 01:23:08.220
SAM: Not without money.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:13.284
LAURA: No, it's his. We'd have to give it back.
That's how it works here in Nicodranas.

01:23:13.284 --> 01:23:16.440
TRAVIS: That might be okay though, Jester. What if
we give it back and he answers us some amazing

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.588
questions or--

01:23:18.588 --> 01:23:21.005
LAURA: I don't want questions. I want to go back
to the Fappy--

01:23:21.006 --> 01:23:23.504
LIAM: Oh my god!

01:23:23.504 --> 01:23:30.382
LAURA: The Happy Fun Time Ball! There are so many
secrets there! The Fappy Fun Time Ball.

01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:33.492
MATT: That's a true artifact, to be fair.

01:23:33.493 --> 01:23:36.350
LIAM: (as Jester) I will never come out again.

01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:38.465
TRAVIS: Well, maybe we don't offer that right
away.

01:23:38.465 --> 01:23:43.645
MARISHA: I don't think we have to offer the
dodecahedron, either. We have our eyewitness

01:23:43.645 --> 01:23:45.365
accounts of--

01:23:45.365 --> 01:23:47.156
SAM: Caleb will know what to say.

01:23:47.156 --> 01:23:49.402
LAURA: Caleb should have been here.

01:23:49.402 --> 01:23:53.544
TRAVIS: Yeah and we really should go back and get
some good dinner and some sleep so we can get

01:23:53.544 --> 01:23:55.982
back here toot-sweet!

01:23:55.982 --> 01:23:59.694
MARISHA: Don't get me wrong. Caleb is very smart.
I know we all know that--

01:23:59.694 --> 01:24:01.538
SAM: With magic especially.

01:24:01.538 --> 01:24:05.347
MARISHA: But you guys have noticed he's not
necessarily the best talker, right?

01:24:05.347 --> 01:24:09.308
SAM: He's an amazing talker. He's charming and
handsome.

01:24:09.308 --> 01:24:13.722
TALIESIN: I think also, since you seem to be
leaning towards honesty, I'm always a big fan of

01:24:13.722 --> 01:24:19.565
honesty being the best way to approach these. Or
as much of the truth as is possible at any moment.

01:24:19.565 --> 01:24:21.808
MARISHA: Well, you can justify anything.

01:24:21.809 --> 01:24:28.484
TALIESIN: I'm always happier to omit than lie if
we have to. Lying's weird.

01:24:28.484 --> 01:24:32.819
MARISHA: I feel like we're bonding. Why have
you never told me this before? You should

01:24:32.819 --> 01:24:35.130
have led with that.

01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:39.849
TALIESIN: Huh. I don't know what that means, but I
agree.

01:24:39.849 --> 01:24:43.933
SAM: Get a room!

01:24:43.933 --> 01:24:51.004
LAURA: We have one! Let's go back to it.

01:24:51.004 --> 01:24:55.166
TALIESIN: Too much has been happening here.

01:24:55.166 --> 01:24:59.386
MATT: So you guys return to the Lavish Chateau?

01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:02.610
LIAM: How long were roughly did all this mess
last before they come back? How long have I

01:25:02.610 --> 01:25:04.603
been in the room?

01:25:04.603 --> 01:25:06.179
MATT: Well, it depends if you guys are going back.
Are you--

01:25:06.179 --> 01:25:07.643
TRAVIS and SAM: We're going back.

01:25:07.643 --> 01:25:09.995
MATT: So they've been gone for roughly, I'd say,
two hours.

01:25:09.995 --> 01:25:11.932
LIAM: Ugh. Okay.

01:25:11.932 --> 01:25:13.605
MARISHA: Is that bad?

01:25:13.605 --> 01:25:16.647
TALIESIN: Potion I bought is for Caleb, so Caleb
gets the healing potion.

01:25:16.648 --> 01:25:18.569
MATT: You have a standard healing potion Caleb.

01:25:18.569 --> 01:25:20.244
LIAM: I'm busy. Come back later.

01:25:20.244 --> 01:25:22.708
TALIESIN: We're going to the tower tomorrow.

01:25:22.708 --> 01:25:25.092
MATT: Do you still have the fish or did you eat
the fish?

01:25:25.092 --> 01:25:30.674
SAM: I ate just a part of the tail but the rest of
is a little chewed on but in paper for dinner.

01:25:30.674 --> 01:25:36.761
MATT: The chef offers to prepare that as your
dinner is already being set for the rest of the

01:25:36.761 --> 01:25:39.831
group at the request of the Ruby.

01:25:39.831 --> 01:25:44.385
LIAM: I would have been in whatever chambers were
given to us so if Caduceus came in with that

01:25:44.385 --> 01:25:47.166
potion, I barely nodded and just kept doing what I
was doing.

01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:52.459
MATT: By the way, Caleb's hair is this cowlick
mess where it's perpetual dog tongue

01:25:52.459 --> 01:25:58.312
licking the entire time that he's been having to
concentrate on his business.

01:25:58.312 --> 01:26:06.173
LIAM: Frumpkin is bushed out. The tail is bushed
out. It's all over and is just staring at Nugget.

01:26:06.173 --> 01:26:09.166
LAURA: As soon as I come home, I go: Nugget,
home!

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:15.173
MATT: (dog panting) Then jumps towards you, but
from ten feet and then appears right in front of

01:26:15.173 --> 01:26:17.630
you and knocks you into the wall.

01:26:17.856 --> 01:26:21.865
LAURA: I love him. We're home.

01:26:21.865 --> 01:26:30.786
MATT: Marion comes and greets you guys. Dinner is
prepared. Meal is enjoyed and you all prepare

01:26:30.787 --> 01:26:34.468
yourselves to bed down for the evening and take on
your events of the following day.

01:26:34.468 --> 01:26:36.117
MARISHA: Dope.

01:26:36.118 --> 01:26:41.583
MATT: We'll go ahead and take our break. A good
point to kick into the next day when we return.

01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:46.714
We'll be back here in a few minutes after we have
our short break. As a reminder, we have our

01:26:46.715 --> 01:26:49.509
Wyrmwood giveaway of tonight.

01:26:49.509 --> 01:26:51.715
LIAM: What kind of wood is it?

01:26:51.715 --> 01:26:57.365
MATT: This is a very nice white oak tabletop tray.
Leather interior. White oak. From our friends at

01:26:57.365 --> 01:27:03.897
Wyrmwood for one lucky winner this evening. The
keyword tonight is "home."

01:27:03.897 --> 01:27:06.333
ALL: Aww.

01:27:06.333 --> 01:27:13.031
MATT: To enter this contest, go ahead and hop
over to the Critical Role twitch at

01:27:13.032 --> 01:27:18.944
twitch.tv/criticalrole and enter the word "home"
once in chat room. Any more than that and you

01:27:19.048 --> 01:27:21.911
would be disqualified. We'll come back from the
break with the winner. Once again, unfortunately

01:27:21.912 --> 01:27:26.157
we can only do people in the U.S. and Canada
excluding Quebec, but between that we'll have a

01:27:26.157 --> 01:27:28.745
winner of you guys when we come back here in a few
minutes. See you then.

01:27:29.249 --> 01:27:34.185
MATT: And welcome back. So before we get back
into the story, our winner of our Wyrmwood

01:27:34.186 --> 01:27:41.501
giveaway this week is Sasudo456. Sasudo456,
congratulations, we'll have that sent off to you

01:27:41.501 --> 01:27:54.043
ASAP. After an evening's rest in the luxurious
rooms of the Lavish Chateau and a fine breakfast,

01:27:54.043 --> 01:27:56.484
what would you like to do for the day
in Nicodranas?

01:27:56.778 --> 01:27:59.506
TRAVIS: Run, double-dash back towards
the wizard's tower.

01:27:59.506 --> 01:28:02.198
MARISHA: Yeah, appointment in the morning,
he said come back in the morning.

01:28:03.518 --> 01:28:09.483
SAM: Caleb, what is going to get us in that door?
Is it information about Uk'otoa?

01:28:09.483 --> 01:28:11.579
LIAM: What door, what are you talking about?

01:28:11.579 --> 01:28:13.910
SAM: We talked about this over dinner
last night--

01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:15.432
LIAM: No, I didn't eat with you.

01:28:15.432 --> 01:28:19.129
SAM: We definitely did, we had a big dinner.
Anyway--

01:28:19.129 --> 01:28:23.286
LAURA: You didn't come to the dinner at all,
Caleb?

01:28:23.286 --> 01:28:24.068
LIAM: No.

01:28:24.068 --> 01:28:30.383
SAM: He's just being coy. We need a story to get us
past the fucking goblin-man who's keeping us from

01:28:30.383 --> 01:28:38.017
getting in the tower. Something to share, something
that his master Yussa Errenis would find yussa-ful.

01:28:39.567 --> 01:28:45.471
LIAM: Before we go down that road, may I ask
what is our actual purpose that we are

01:28:45.471 --> 01:28:47.671
not telling him about? Why are we doing this?

01:28:47.731 --> 01:28:49.319
TRAVIS: I want to see the inside!

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.136
LAURA: I'm pretty sure it's just because
we think it's cool.

01:28:52.136 --> 01:28:54.084
SAM: I have an actual reason.

01:28:54.974 --> 01:28:55.900
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;?

01:28:56.270 --> 01:29:01.609
SAM: A powerful mage, with access
to magical spells and books.

01:29:01.609 --> 01:29:05.170
LIAM: So we are going to go in and case
the joint to rob him blind?

01:29:05.170 --> 01:29:07.890
SAM: No! Maybe we just take a few books.

01:29:07.891 --> 01:29:10.794
LAURA: Maybe he's really nice and he wants
to be our best friend.

01:29:10.794 --> 01:29:16.162
TALIESIN: I have some legitimate questions about
things that I am curious about, and we do actually

01:29:16.163 --> 01:29:23.314
own some objects that maybe we should have
a learned man take a look at.

01:29:23.594 --> 01:29:27.434
MARISHA: We told him it was an emergency,
so we still have to go forward with that.

01:29:27.434 --> 01:29:28.789
TALIESIN: Mine is.

01:29:29.169 --> 01:29:30.470
MARISHA: For you.

01:29:30.471 --> 01:29:31.281
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:29:31.441 --> 01:29:35.051
MARISHA: But what is going to be an
emergency for a man that's not threatened

01:29:35.052 --> 01:29:36.961
by the things that you're threatened by?

01:29:38.231 --> 01:29:39.111
TRAVIS: Uk'otoa.

01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:42.705
TALIESIN: There seems to be a lot of weird
things happening.

01:29:42.712 --> 01:29:46.326
MARISHA: Is no one into talking about the
tower getting attacked in Zadash?

01:29:46.326 --> 01:29:49.761
SAM: It's true, and it's impending danger,
I like that one a lot.

01:29:49.761 --> 01:29:54.236
LIAM: I do too, there is a war brewing in the
Empire, it is going to spill south. That is not a

01:29:54.236 --> 01:30:02.298
lie, that is an inevitability. So I feel that we
can talk to him, and trust me, no one in this room

01:30:02.298 --> 01:30:09.692
is more curious about the inside of that tower
than I am, but to what end are we doing this? Like

01:30:09.692 --> 01:30:15.152
are we going to go to the hilt, are we going to
slay this mage and take his books, or make nice

01:30:15.152 --> 01:30:17.635
conversation and steal a book? It seems like--

01:30:18.575 --> 01:30:21.800
MARISHA: We could just make nice
conversation and ask for a book. Oh god,

01:30:21.801 --> 01:30:23.836
I'm starting to sound like Caduceus!

01:30:23.836 --> 01:30:25.743
TRAVIS: Yeah, you better watch yourself.

01:30:25.743 --> 01:30:28.311
LAURA: No, that didn't really sound
like him very much.

01:30:28.311 --> 01:30:29.883
TALIESIN: You can be a lot lower.

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:32.022
LIAM: Caduceus is very soothing to listen to.

01:30:32.022 --> 01:30:35.303
TRAVIS: I'd like to know what he knows,
if he knows more about Uk'otoa

01:30:35.303 --> 01:30:36.781
or maybe how to counteract him.

01:30:36.781 --> 01:30:42.041
SAM: That's right, there is still one Uk'otoa
gate out there that we don't know where it is,

01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:43.661
maybe this mage knows where it is.

01:30:43.661 --> 01:30:48.081
TRAVIS: Maybe he's up for a friendly conversation.
I don't think we're your average fisherman.

01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:49.473
I mean, we've seen some shit.

01:30:49.473 --> 01:30:53.892
LIAM: Well, I am curious, and Beauregard is
correct that it is something we could legitimately

01:30:53.892 --> 01:30:58.135
talk about without spilling the beans about
everything that everyone has got going on with

01:30:58.135 --> 01:31:03.673
themselves, and I am, of course, curious. I just
want to make sure. You know, I've talked about

01:31:03.673 --> 01:31:10.166
calculated risks before, and I don't want to run
willy-nilly towards folly like we have done with

01:31:10.166 --> 01:31:13.233
the boat. We are all standing here,
but that was foolish.

01:31:13.233 --> 01:31:17.602
MARISHA: Look, at the end of the day, this
guy has access, right? Making him our ally

01:31:17.602 --> 01:31:22.881
in some way could come in useful, even in
ways we might not be aware yet.

01:31:23.532 --> 01:31:25.169
LAURA: What do you think, Yasha?

01:31:26.779 --> 01:31:33.469
MATT: "Well, I mean, do what you're going to do,
just try not to get us killed by a wizard, please?"

01:31:34.805 --> 01:31:35.779
LAURA: Good call.

01:31:37.778 --> 01:31:39.422
TRAVIS: Yep, of the utmost importance.

01:31:39.455 --> 01:31:41.314
MARISHA: She's so poignant when she speaks.

01:31:45.562 --> 01:31:47.899
LIAM: We just don't need to be too pushy.

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.181
ALL: No!

01:31:50.181 --> 01:31:56.050
SAM: We all have questions, and there's a lot of
unknowns out there, and if this person could check

01:31:56.050 --> 01:32:05.999
off just one of the boxes, then that would
be worth it. Maybe we make an ally and he

01:32:05.999 --> 01:32:09.809
can check off more than one box, tell us
about the dodecahedron.

01:32:09.810 --> 01:32:11.678
TRAVIS: Check off a bunch of boxes.

01:32:13.499 --> 01:32:18.925
LIAM: Yeah, well potentially he could turn us over
to people that we are not interested in

01:32:18.926 --> 01:32:22.863
turned over to. But I'm not saying no,
let's just be careful, that's all.

01:32:22.863 --> 01:32:24.253
TRAVIS: Yeah, fair enough.

01:32:24.292 --> 01:32:30.478
MARISHA: Well, this guy is anti-Clovis Concord,
so, I don't know. I don't think he's--

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:33.541
LAURA: I worry that he's going to do
something to you Caleb, personally.

01:32:36.441 --> 01:32:37.880
LIAM: I don't think so.

01:32:37.907 --> 01:32:41.541
MARISHA: I have a feeling this guy is a
bit of a rogue agent in terms of-- Right?

01:32:41.541 --> 01:32:45.959
Because the Clovis Concord-- Sorry, a
little repeat of the Concord?

01:32:45.959 --> 01:32:49.818
MATT: The Clovis Concord is a union of all
the various city-states that make up--

01:32:49.819 --> 01:32:51.634
MARISHA and MATT: The Menagerie Coast.

01:32:51.634 --> 01:32:52.402
MATT: Correct.

01:32:52.402 --> 01:32:54.790
MARISHA: They're like the government
for Menagerie.

01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:59.402
MATT: Yes. While each city is locally governed in
and of itself, for the marquis that run all the

01:32:59.402 --> 01:33:03.363
various merchant guilds-- It's very much a
guild-centric government.

01:33:03.363 --> 01:33:04.727
MARISHA: Like an oligarchy?

01:33:04.727 --> 01:33:05.847
MATT: Kind of.

01:33:05.847 --> 01:33:07.527
LIAM: Like the early colonies here?

01:33:07.528 --> 01:33:12.011
MATT: Yeah, in a way. But all the marquis work
together to maintain a generally consistent rule

01:33:12.011 --> 01:33:16.161
of law and maintain peace and order through that.

01:33:16.169 --> 01:33:20.519
MARISHA: They're anti this guy because
he's outside of their--

01:33:20.519 --> 01:33:25.260
MATT: You don't know how they feel about him,
but from what you heard from the Ruby is that

01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:30.269
he seems to be the one person who won't
sell their house in the neighborhood

01:33:30.269 --> 01:33:33.781
to get the train tracks built, you know?
That kind of thing.

01:33:33.781 --> 01:33:39.370
MARISHA: I just wrote down "the chagrin of the
Clovis Concord," so I'm assuming that's what she said.

01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:40.368
TRAVIS: You're there.

01:33:40.369 --> 01:33:41.372
MATT: There you go.

01:33:42.812 --> 01:33:45.153
TRAVIS: So who did the knocking last time?

01:33:45.645 --> 01:33:46.743
MARISHA: Jester.

01:33:46.743 --> 01:33:48.144
TRAVIS: Did you do anything special?

01:33:48.234 --> 01:33:50.243
LAURA: Yeah. It was a real special knock.

01:33:50.243 --> 01:33:52.093
TRAVIS: Can you replicate it today?

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:53.214
LAURA: I think I can.

01:33:53.214 --> 01:33:54.403
TRAVIS: Then get after it.

01:33:54.404 --> 01:33:56.565
LAURA: Are we right in front of the tower?

01:33:56.565 --> 01:33:57.502
SAM: We are.

01:33:58.592 --> 01:34:00.405
LIAM: We had a walk-and-talk just now.

01:34:00.423 --> 01:34:05.336
MATT: As you guys have been walking and talking
towards the tower in the early morning hours.

01:34:06.087 --> 01:34:07.324
TRAVIS: Power-walking.

01:34:08.284 --> 01:34:13.937
MATT: All right, as you guys make your way to the
Open Quay, you approach the tower. All right, you knock?

01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:21.057
LAURA: Take notes, Fjord. Knock, knock, knock.

01:34:21.884 --> 01:34:23.267
TRAVIS: Grabbed her elbow.

01:34:23.396 --> 01:34:26.677
MATT: There's a pause. "Can I help you?"

01:34:27.952 --> 01:34:30.836
LAURA: Wait, does that not sound like
a goblin? Where is it?

01:34:30.836 --> 01:34:32.722
SAM: Is it on our side, or around the--

01:34:32.722 --> 01:34:34.385
MATT: You're hearing it around you.

01:34:34.386 --> 01:34:35.115
LAURA: Look up!

01:34:35.115 --> 01:34:39.821
MATT: You see about 30 feet up, that balcony that
was there originally is there, and standing at the

01:34:39.821 --> 01:34:44.291
edge of it you see a figure. Hard to see at this
angle and this distance, but a figure is there

01:34:44.292 --> 01:34:51.955
with long, dull golden robes, holding a
small teacup and a saucer, glancing

01:34:51.955 --> 01:34:54.325
over the edge and looking down.

01:34:57.205 --> 01:35:00.783
TALIESIN: We were hoping for an audience
if you have time this morning?

01:35:04.294 --> 01:35:08.644
MATT: "You just happened to approach and
knock for an audience?"

01:35:09.784 --> 01:35:14.809
TALIESIN: We came by yesterday, and we
were told it might be best to come back

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:16.727
in the morning. We brought tea.

01:35:16.727 --> 01:35:19.142
MATT: "Did you make an appointment
with Wensfeld?"

01:35:19.142 --> 01:35:22.175
TALIESIN: Yes, he said to come back
in the morning.

01:35:22.745 --> 01:35:24.185
MARISHA: It's an emergency.

01:35:24.517 --> 01:35:26.108
LAURA: We have really good tea!

01:35:26.199 --> 01:35:27.190
MARISHA: Earl Grey!

01:35:27.367 --> 01:35:29.279
MATT: Both of you make persuasion checks.

01:35:29.279 --> 01:35:30.092
TRAVIS: Damn it!

01:35:30.092 --> 01:35:32.428
TALIESIN: We don't have Earl Grey, I don't think.

01:35:35.218 --> 01:35:36.492
SAM: First good roll of the night.

01:35:36.631 --> 01:35:37.867
TRAVIS: We do have Earl.

01:35:38.235 --> 01:35:39.251
LAURA: 21!

01:35:39.997 --> 01:35:42.198
MARISHA: Natural one. We don't have Earl Grey.

01:35:42.204 --> 01:35:43.252
SAM: That's true.

01:35:44.542 --> 01:35:45.479
TALIESIN: We don't.

01:35:47.135 --> 01:35:55.547
MATT: "Well, it appears that you have not
made an appointment, and you do not

01:35:55.547 --> 01:35:57.649
"have the tea that you are promising."

01:35:58.225 --> 01:36:00.498
LAURA: But we have better tea than that.

01:36:00.498 --> 01:36:03.286
TALIESIN: I'm a fine tea-maker.

01:36:03.938 --> 01:36:05.465
SAM: Give him some information!

01:36:05.869 --> 01:36:08.417
TRAVIS: We also have news of grave import.

01:36:08.817 --> 01:36:10.937
MARISHA: From Zadash, from the Empire.

01:36:10.937 --> 01:36:12.367
SAM: Dangerous information.

01:36:12.387 --> 01:36:16.718
MATT: "Then, please, would you be so kind as to
present me with this dangerous information."

01:36:17.615 --> 01:36:19.470
LAURA: Don't you want our tea, though?

01:36:19.471 --> 01:36:22.324
SAM: We might not want to shout it
in the streets, up to you!

01:36:22.324 --> 01:36:25.842
MATT: "You don't have to shout it." You
notice that his voice is a whisper,

01:36:25.842 --> 01:36:27.701
even though he's 30 feet away from you.

01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:30.264
TALIESIN: We feel a bit exposed, I would admit.

01:36:31.426 --> 01:36:35.908
MATT: "You're safe." There's some sort of
amplification to his voice and it's placing it

01:36:35.953 --> 01:36:39.448
omnipresent around you at this low volume,
like he's right there.

01:36:39.448 --> 01:36:42.489
LIAM: Can we tell from where we are if he's
human or elven, or--?

01:36:42.489 --> 01:36:43.997
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:36:48.755 --> 01:36:49.479
LIAM: 21.

01:36:51.616 --> 01:37:01.410
MATT: Glancing up, he appears to be elven, a
darker complexion, which is different from the

01:37:01.455 --> 01:37:09.117
elves of Bysaes Tyl, up in the Empire, which come
from the north near Uthudurn, which was mentioned

01:37:09.117 --> 01:37:14.354
before, so this is probably an elf from Gwardan,
which is one of the coastal cities here, which

01:37:14.354 --> 01:37:19.955
originated from Marquet long ago, like
a lot of the Menagerie Coast did.

01:37:19.955 --> 01:37:21.448
TALIESIN: Mr. Deep Lore.

01:37:24.818 --> 01:37:26.116
LAURA: Knows it all!

01:37:26.116 --> 01:37:29.098
MATT: Some people have hobbies, I stay
at home and write this.

01:37:30.210 --> 01:37:36.176
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull a pouch of my better
tea and... I'm not really sure what to do with it.

01:37:37.295 --> 01:37:38.710
SAM: Give him some info!

01:37:39.379 --> 01:37:41.304
TALIESIN: Have you ever heard of
The Blooming Grove?

01:37:45.555 --> 01:37:53.532
MATT: He takes a second. "I'm sure that
it's crossed my path, but it is not in my

01:37:53.532 --> 01:37:55.210
"immediate peripheral."

01:37:56.168 --> 01:37:59.899
TALIESIN: This tea is made from a flower
that only grows there in the north,

01:38:00.239 --> 01:38:04.843
from one of the original families.
It's very rare.

01:38:07.673 --> 01:38:10.152
MATT: "Choose one, and enter."

01:38:11.872 --> 01:38:15.418
LAURA: (whispers) Just one person gets to go in?

01:38:16.911 --> 01:38:20.448
MATT: You look down to talk amongst yourselves,
and there's a door on the wall that wasn't there

01:38:20.449 --> 01:38:23.127
when your attention was faced away from it.

01:38:23.817 --> 01:38:27.225
TRAVIS: We all bum-rush it! No, I'm good.
I'm not fucking with this one.

01:38:28.811 --> 01:38:30.858
MATT: And you punch Fjord for no reason?

01:38:32.131 --> 01:38:33.671
MARISHA: Eliminate your enemies!

01:38:34.982 --> 01:38:37.993
SAM: (quietly) Maybe take someone who can
get word out?

01:38:39.612 --> 01:38:42.839
TALIESIN: You're making a big assumption
that word can leave.

01:38:42.849 --> 01:38:44.992
SAM and TRAVIS: That's true.

01:38:45.729 --> 01:38:51.050
TALIESIN: Let's not. It's either probably
you or me, I suppose. I don't know.

01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:52.101
TRAVIS: You plus one.

01:38:52.101 --> 01:38:53.908
SAM: You plus one. You get a plus one.

01:38:53.908 --> 01:38:56.004
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was just choose one.

01:38:56.051 --> 01:38:59.511
MATT: He was telling him to choose one
and enter, so there is a plus one.

01:38:59.523 --> 01:39:01.011
LAURA: Oh, there is a plus one!

01:39:01.011 --> 01:39:05.014
TALIESIN: Let's get all the things we might
want to show him together really quickly.

01:39:05.224 --> 01:39:06.990
SAM: What might we want to show him?

01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:08.609
TALIESIN: I want the dodecahedron.

01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:10.944
LAURA: I don't want to show him the dodecahedron.

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:11.654
SAM: No.

01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:15.094
LAURA: (singing) But you can look at it
and get a little lucky luck!

01:39:15.094 --> 01:39:17.094
MARISHA: Maybe he'll see us looking at it.

01:39:17.094 --> 01:39:19.396
LIAM: Did he just hear that entire conversation?

01:39:19.396 --> 01:39:20.267
MATT: Probably.

01:39:22.276 --> 01:39:23.796
TALIESIN: We'll talk about it.

01:39:23.796 --> 01:39:27.404
TRAVIS: Three notes are ask about Uk'otoa,
I trust you, make good decisions.

01:39:27.404 --> 01:39:33.726
SAM: Is there any evidence? Do we have any items
from the Xhorhasian-- the crick that we found?

01:39:33.726 --> 01:39:34.833
TALIESIN: We have the--

01:39:34.833 --> 01:39:36.046
LAURA: Don't call him a--

01:39:36.046 --> 01:39:39.315
TALIESIN: Do you trust me?

01:39:39.315 --> 01:39:41.168
LAURA: Well yeah, but I don't know him.

01:39:41.168 --> 01:39:42.784
TALIESIN: Okay, you keep it, but--

01:39:42.784 --> 01:39:44.305
SAM: Do you want Fappy Fun Ball?

01:39:44.305 --> 01:39:45.362
TALIESIN: Yes, please.

01:39:45.362 --> 01:39:46.885
SAM: You do want Fappy Fun Ball?

01:39:46.885 --> 01:39:47.933
TALIESIN: Yes, please.

01:39:47.933 --> 01:39:49.794
SAM: Should we give him Fappy Fun Ball?

01:39:49.794 --> 01:39:50.542
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:39:50.543 --> 01:39:56.316
TALIESIN: And I may, with your permission,
mention what we have? Thank you.

01:39:56.828 --> 01:39:58.970
LAURA: Don't lose this, okay?

01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:00.110
TRAVIS: What is it?

01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:01.679
LAURA: That's the Fappy Fun Ball.

01:40:01.679 --> 01:40:04.104
TALIESIN: Only if it leads to something better.

01:40:04.104 --> 01:40:06.034
LAURA: Caduceus!

01:40:06.034 --> 01:40:07.336
TALIESIN: Try and be good.

01:40:10.266 --> 01:40:16.831
SAM: Caduceus, just bringing this up: you know
that Beau ruins every situation she's in.

01:40:18.131 --> 01:40:19.667
LAURA: You don't do that, Beau.

01:40:19.683 --> 01:40:24.267
SAM: And is horribly abrasive to talk to
and sometimes look at.

01:40:24.267 --> 01:40:28.286
LAURA: That's not true. You're beautiful
and you're also really nice.

01:40:28.286 --> 01:40:32.247
TALIESIN: I feel like between Beau and I,
we cover everything very well.

01:40:32.247 --> 01:40:34.590
SAM: You're not taking the dodecahedron
in, right?

01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:35.707
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

01:40:35.707 --> 01:40:38.277
SAM: But one of you should look at it
before you go in.

01:40:38.277 --> 01:40:39.798
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I said.

01:40:39.798 --> 01:40:41.040
TALIESIN: I don't need it.

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.187
TRAVIS: You've got some high charisma, right?

01:40:43.187 --> 01:40:44.335
LAURA: Look at it, Beau.

01:40:44.335 --> 01:40:46.434
LAURA: Just for a minute. Look at it.

01:40:46.434 --> 01:40:49.648
MARISHA: I look up at Yussa. Is he watching?

01:40:49.648 --> 01:40:50.367
MATT: Yeah.

01:40:50.367 --> 01:40:52.749
SAM: You should take Caleb,
he's a master of magic!

01:40:52.749 --> 01:40:54.437
TALIESIN: No, we're going in.

01:40:54.437 --> 01:40:56.523
TRAVIS: Yeah, go in. Go, that's your fate.

01:40:56.523 --> 01:40:57.802
MARISHA: I go in!

01:40:59.397 --> 01:41:03.795
MATT: As you reach out, there's no handle for the
door, you place your hand on it, and it opens

01:41:03.795 --> 01:41:11.234
inside. As soon as you look within-- and the rest
of you can see around the rather hulking form of

01:41:11.235 --> 01:41:16.106
Caduceus, which you have to duck to get through
the doorway-- on the inside it looks to be a very

01:41:16.106 --> 01:41:25.986
simple sitting room, a den. You can see two
couches facing each other at an angle, with a deep

01:41:25.986 --> 01:41:31.553
red-brown maroon upholstery to it,
a velvety texture.

01:41:31.553 --> 01:41:36.066
MARISHA: Before we went in, I wanted to--
can I bring Frumpkin?

01:41:36.066 --> 01:41:38.825
MATT: You've got to do that now,
because you're walking in.

01:41:38.825 --> 01:41:39.937
MARISHA: Yep, Frumpkin.

01:41:39.937 --> 01:41:40.624
LIAM: What?

01:41:40.624 --> 01:41:41.867
MARISHA: Give me Frumpkin.

01:41:41.867 --> 01:41:42.604
LIAM: For what?

01:41:42.604 --> 01:41:44.525
MARISHA: Do you not want to see in this?

01:41:44.525 --> 01:41:46.528
MATT: The door is closing behind Caduceus.

01:41:46.528 --> 01:41:49.337
MARISHA: Fuck it, I'll leave. He won't give me
his damn cat.

01:41:49.357 --> 01:41:55.194
MATT: You enter behind Caduceus. On the inside,
there is a singular staircase that spirals down

01:41:55.195 --> 01:42:03.075
from the upper floor, maybe about 15 feet up.
There's this set of two couches, a small table,

01:42:03.667 --> 01:42:18.480
there's already a small platter that has a couple
of small teacups and a teakettle of some kind.

01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:21.741
TALIESIN: Brewed or unbrewed? Just ready
to be brewed?

01:42:21.741 --> 01:42:28.658
MATT: You don't know. The rest of the chamber has
no windows, it's all locked off. There is a

01:42:28.658 --> 01:42:37.229
chandelier above, very simple metal ring that has
these glass baubles placed in six different places

01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:45.431
along it that give a soft, pulsing-- similar to
firelight-- a warm, orange glow. It's a nice dark,

01:42:45.431 --> 01:42:49.989
comfortable den atmosphere. What do you guys do?

01:42:50.877 --> 01:42:56.688
TALIESIN: I'm going to check to see if there's
tea brewed, and if there isn't, I'll brew tea.

01:42:56.732 --> 01:42:58.113
MATT: There is no tea brewed.

01:42:58.114 --> 01:42:59.605
TALIESIN: I will brew some tea.

01:42:59.684 --> 01:43:06.008
MATT: All right. As you begin that process, you
hear the soft footsteps beginning to descend the

01:43:06.008 --> 01:43:18.857
stairs, and there you see the figure come down. It
is a male elf, light-brown, tan skin. The hair is

01:43:18.857 --> 01:43:32.448
short-- cut very short in the back, and it curls
up into this side wave. Jet-- not jet. Jet-white

01:43:32.448 --> 01:43:42.378
is not a thing. Stark white hair, and very
chiseled features, but you can see the crow's nest

01:43:42.378 --> 01:43:47.888
wrinkles coming in. From what elves you've seen,
this is a very old elf. Of what age begins to come

01:43:47.888 --> 01:43:53.688
through, there are a lot of years on this elf.
Shorter than most elves that you've seen, probably

01:43:53.688 --> 01:44:02.684
comes to about maybe five feet, maybe a little
under that. The robes themselves have a golden

01:44:02.684 --> 01:44:09.519
shimmer that looks like the threads themselves may
actually be gold or something that very much

01:44:09.519 --> 01:44:16.269
mimics the properties of gold. As he steps down,
the rest of the robe drags down the spiral.

01:44:16.269 --> 01:44:20.112
He comes and sits on-- Are you both sitting
at the same couch?

01:44:21.472 --> 01:44:22.832
MARISHA: Sure.

01:44:23.009 --> 01:44:28.308
MATT: All right. He goes and quietly sits in
the one across. Sits back. There is a stoic,

01:44:28.308 --> 01:44:39.093
emotionless face there, head cocked to the side
out of curiosity. "Well, while you finish your tea

01:44:39.093 --> 01:44:43.995
"you have promised, what is this emergency
you have brought to my attention

01:44:43.995 --> 01:44:47.104
"and interrupted my morning routine for?"

01:44:48.534 --> 01:44:57.928
MARISHA: I deeply-- You have a morning routine?
Oh that's impressive-- Sorry! Deeply apologize for

01:44:57.928 --> 01:45:08.050
interrupting. We're from Zadash. We are a hired
mercenary group here to deliver very specific

01:45:08.051 --> 01:45:16.247
information, from Zadash, about an attack
that happened on the Zauber Spire.

01:45:17.429 --> 01:45:22.696
MATT: "And at whose behest have you been
hired to deliver this information to me?"

01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:31.033
MARISHA: Well, it is a joint effort between
the Hall of Erudition and the Cobalt Soul.

01:45:34.776 --> 01:45:38.136
MATT: He eyes you very closely.

01:45:40.047 --> 01:45:43.950
MARISHA: A lot of people are banding together
now that war is on the home front.

01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:49.232
So unlikely alliances are happening
all across the continent.

01:45:50.056 --> 01:45:53.958
MATT: "So part of this is requesting
alliance with the Cobalt Soul?"

01:45:55.194 --> 01:45:58.286
MARISHA: Just a friendly passing off
of information.

01:45:58.907 --> 01:46:00.852
MATT: "Very well. Is the tea ready?"

01:46:00.852 --> 01:46:02.475
TALIESIN: The tea is indeed ready.

01:46:02.476 --> 01:46:05.339
MATT: "How wonderful. Pour it if you
do not mind. Thank you."

01:46:05.339 --> 01:46:09.448
MARISHA: Of course, if you would like to
discuss alliances...

01:46:10.949 --> 01:46:13.165
TALIESIN: Stick to what we know, for now.

01:46:17.435 --> 01:46:18.654
MATT: "It is quite good."

01:46:19.696 --> 01:46:22.423
TALIESIN: Thank you. I'll leave some extra
for later.

01:46:22.705 --> 01:46:31.238
MATT: "I'd appreciate it. Blooming Grove, yes. Is
there a name to this one?"

01:46:31.918 --> 01:46:37.071
TALIESIN: That family was one of the first four--
I think it may have been the Graves, actually,

01:46:37.071 --> 01:46:45.108
which is ironic, the more I think about it.
Each tea is made mystically from a family

01:46:45.108 --> 01:46:49.286
that is buried within our graveyard.

01:46:49.286 --> 01:46:55.091
MATT: "This I recall since you brought it up,
yes. Thank you. Continue, please."

01:46:55.468 --> 01:47:02.188
MARISHA: Yes, I guess just a friendly passing
of information and that maybe you would

01:47:02.188 --> 01:47:08.443
like to exchange information in return,
if you might know anything.

01:47:10.199 --> 01:47:17.434
MATT: "Well, offer your information and if
there is something I can offer that seems

01:47:17.434 --> 01:47:21.385
"relative or involved, I will be happy to
pass it along as well."

01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:25.229
MARISHA: Fantastic, thank you. Uh...

01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:32.139
(laughter)

01:47:32.139 --> 01:47:33.901
MARISHA: Trying real hard here, guys.

01:47:33.901 --> 01:47:35.286
TRAVIS: Yes. Good. Excellent.

01:47:38.539 --> 01:47:47.307
MARISHA: Well, as we mentioned, the Xhorhasian
army has breached into the empire. We witnessed

01:47:47.307 --> 01:47:51.407
an attack from crick assassins on the tower.

01:47:51.407 --> 01:47:53.040
TALIESIN: I didn't. I was told--

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:59.140
MARISHA: Sorry. He wasn't with us at the time,
but the rest of us did witness an attack and

01:47:59.141 --> 01:48:01.891
encountered the Xhorhasian ourselves.

01:48:01.891 --> 01:48:04.555
MATT: "This was the assault on
the Tri-Spire, correct?"

01:48:04.555 --> 01:48:06.551
MARISHA: Correct. I see you've heard.

01:48:06.761 --> 01:48:09.155
MATT: "Word gets around, in certain circles."

01:48:09.785 --> 01:48:15.234
MARISHA: Beyond that we've recently heard
that the Xhorhasians have reached Felderwin.

01:48:15.865 --> 01:48:17.425
MATT: "I've heard this as well."

01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:28.540
MARISHA: Our group has been on the ocean, in
search for further information on behalf of the Empire.

01:48:29.209 --> 01:48:33.278
MATT: "The ocean seems a strange place to
seek for information when the Xhorhasians

01:48:33.279 --> 01:48:34.563
"are fighting in the East."

01:48:34.603 --> 01:48:42.643
MARISHA: You're not wrong. We got word halfway
through, in a jungle, that a lesser god that likes

01:48:42.643 --> 01:48:49.290
to go by the name of Uk'otoa might have some
sway in everything that's going on.

01:48:51.217 --> 01:49:00.842
MATT: "Uk'otoa is a mythological entity in the
history of the Ki'Nau, the people who were of this

01:49:01.842 --> 01:49:08.599
"coast before the Marquesians came. So I've
heard of it, but it has been long gone."

01:49:08.982 --> 01:49:17.283
MARISHA: I don't think so. I think he's on
the verge of returning, and I think there

01:49:17.283 --> 01:49:21.092
might be followers and patrons who
might be aiding that cause.

01:49:21.142 --> 01:49:24.473
MATT: "You think this Uk'otoa is connected
to this war in the east?"

01:49:24.952 --> 01:49:30.432
MARISHA: We have reason to believe that
maybe some Xhorhasian spies and soldiers

01:49:30.432 --> 01:49:32.209
might be worshipers of Uk'otoa.

01:49:32.664 --> 01:49:36.432
TALIESIN: There are a lot of strange things
all happening in congruence.

01:49:37.356 --> 01:49:41.761
MATT: "There are strange things happening all
across Exandria at any given time. To find the

01:49:41.762 --> 01:49:47.053
"threads that truly tie them, that takes
an insightful mind. Continue."

01:49:48.732 --> 01:49:50.477
TRAVIS: (nervous laugh) Fuck.

01:49:52.097 --> 01:49:59.242
MARISHA: We've received a vision, through mystical
means that I do not feel comfortable sharing, of a

01:49:59.297 --> 01:50:10.772
potential location for where Uk'otoa is captured.
A jungle landscape somewhere on the continent.

01:50:10.772 --> 01:50:13.979
You wouldn't happen to have any ideas would you?

01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:23.261
MATT: "Well, to be honest, there are many jungle
landscapes on this coast. I have not heard

01:50:23.262 --> 01:50:31.472
"anything of Uk'otoa's location, nor is it of
any particular interest to me at the moment."

01:50:36.657 --> 01:50:37.568
MARISHA: Okay.

01:50:38.415 --> 01:50:39.381
SAM: (quietly) Next!

01:50:39.692 --> 01:50:41.024
MARISHA: Beyond that--

01:50:41.269 --> 01:50:43.459
LAURA: Checking the boxes, checking the boxes!

01:50:49.044 --> 01:50:50.327
MARISHA: We found a thing.

01:50:50.989 --> 01:50:51.774
SAM: Yep.

01:50:52.407 --> 01:50:54.444
MATT: "Tell me of this thing you found."

01:50:59.017 --> 01:51:01.487
MARISHA: (aside) Which thing should I
tell him about?

01:51:01.487 --> 01:51:05.005
TALIESIN: Start with the least interesting
and work your way up, I suppose.

01:51:07.503 --> 01:51:12.345
MARISHA: It was presented to us as
the Happy Fun Time Ball.

01:51:12.878 --> 01:51:17.539
TALIESIN: I actually have it, if I recall, I grabbed
it from you. I'm going to put it on the table.

01:51:20.250 --> 01:51:27.198
MATT: You see his fingers trace a few small gestures
in the air, speaking very quietly under his breath.

01:51:28.221 --> 01:51:30.381
LAURA: And all three of you bamf to...

01:51:30.432 --> 01:51:32.407
(laughter)

01:51:32.438 --> 01:51:34.350
TRAVIS: A bright green dragon.

01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:38.334
MATT: "Interesting."

01:51:38.875 --> 01:51:39.709
TALIESIN: Odd.

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.457
MATT: "How did you come about this?"

01:51:42.959 --> 01:51:48.242
MARISHA: Stumbled upon us through a little girl.
I think she thought it was a toy.

01:51:48.773 --> 01:51:51.040
TALIESIN: Things keep stumbling upon us.

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:54.560
MATT: "How does this connect to the war
in the east?"

01:51:55.275 --> 01:52:01.978
TALIESIN: Things that should not be... Things are
becoming misplaced that should not be misplaced. I

01:52:01.978 --> 01:52:09.156
feel like that fact that we have this means that a
powerful magic user is no longer available. People

01:52:09.156 --> 01:52:13.541
of great power going missing and getting
attacked. The tower. All these things.

01:52:15.026 --> 01:52:19.626
MATT: "You are not wrong. The individual
who this belongs to, however,

01:52:19.627 --> 01:52:21.481
"has been missing for quite some time."

01:52:21.481 --> 01:52:24.292
TALIESIN: Apparently, if I recall,
is no longer with us now.

01:52:24.314 --> 01:52:28.514
MATT: "Well there is no confirmation of that,
but has not been seen in many, many years."

01:52:29.288 --> 01:52:35.905
MARISHA: Seems like everyone is getting butterfingers
with their magical items or magical folk.

01:52:38.292 --> 01:52:39.203
MATT: "Interesting."

01:52:39.254 --> 01:52:45.474
TALIESIN: There's more. I'm going to show
the sword, just because this is odd.

01:52:47.003 --> 01:52:52.754
And there was also-- The grove is dying.

01:52:55.694 --> 01:52:59.942
MATT: "Is this related to the corruption
from Malaismere?"

01:52:59.942 --> 01:53:07.184
TALIESIN: I don't know. Perhaps. I asked
the Wildmother for guidance and it brought

01:53:07.184 --> 01:53:12.529
me to this. That certainly sparks my interest.

01:53:13.826 --> 01:53:17.966
MATT: "If I recall this Blooming Grove
exists in the Savalierwood, correct?"

01:53:17.966 --> 01:53:18.895
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:53:20.038 --> 01:53:23.255
MATT: "The fact that it's been able to resist
the corruption of the forest this long

01:53:23.255 --> 01:53:26.467
"is in itself a testament to its guardians"

01:53:26.525 --> 01:53:33.265
TALIESIN: Do you know anything of its sister
temples? Of whether they hold or not? If...

01:53:34.567 --> 01:53:40.635
MATT: "I do not think that is my specialty,
unfortunately. I am not a purveyor of faith."

01:53:41.774 --> 01:53:46.267
TALIESIN: There is no reason for this
magic to be diminishing. It's very odd.

01:53:46.267 --> 01:53:47.606
Why would it be diminishing?

01:53:47.614 --> 01:53:52.095
MATT: "I could not tell you. Perhaps it was an
imperfect enchantment, or perhaps the magic that

01:53:52.095 --> 01:53:55.614
"holds sway over the Savalierwood is
growing stronger. But that would be--"

01:53:55.614 --> 01:53:57.422
TALIESIN: That would be odd in itself.

01:53:57.422 --> 01:54:00.845
MATT: "It would, but unfortunately
that is beyond my specialties."

01:54:01.087 --> 01:54:06.094
MARISHA: Do you not find it concerning
that the Savalierwood is on the

01:54:06.094 --> 01:54:08.856
borderlines of the Xhorhasian Empire?

01:54:09.715 --> 01:54:14.204
MATT: "It is on the borders, actually, of the
Greying Wildlands in the north. It is closer to

01:54:14.204 --> 01:54:19.944
"the Empire than it is Xhorhas, so it would a
bigger threat to the King Bertrand Dwendal than

01:54:19.944 --> 01:54:22.384
"it would be to any of the Kryn Dynasty."

01:54:24.628 --> 01:54:27.857
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I actually knew that.

01:54:31.389 --> 01:54:35.880
MATT: "But it seems to only spread through the
forest and seems to be proximity to Malaismere's

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:44.749
"ruins, so it has been that way for a number of
centuries. If there is a sign of it expanding into

01:54:44.749 --> 01:54:53.670
"the Pearlbow Wilderness, then that is something you
should definitely let the king know, but I do not

01:54:53.670 --> 01:55:00.200
"know of any signs of that. Once again,
I do not mean to rush you, but--"

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:04.868
TALIESIN: The last thing-- Well I don't know. I'm
not going to say it because you're the smart one,

01:55:04.869 --> 01:55:14.679
but I think perhaps it is worth mentioning the
thing you saw when the tower fell, the thing that

01:55:14.679 --> 01:55:22.051
was being ferretted, the thing you saw.
I don't know how to best describe it.

01:55:22.141 --> 01:55:27.701
MARISHA: I'm sure you have very keen eyes
and you saw the artifact that I was looking at

01:55:27.701 --> 01:55:29.850
before I entered into this tower?

01:55:30.659 --> 01:55:33.305
MATT: "I saw something. I do not know
the nature of it."

01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:41.981
MARISHA: It appears to be a magical geometric
orb that has the ability to bend

01:55:41.981 --> 01:55:50.620
elements of time and space and fate.

01:55:52.403 --> 01:55:54.779
MATT: "These are radical claims that you make."

01:55:55.610 --> 01:55:57.290
MARISHA: I've seen into it.

01:55:57.807 --> 01:56:06.045
MATT: "How much capability does it have? How did
you come upon it? These are now two extremely

01:56:06.045 --> 01:56:11.651
"powerful things in your grasp that you seem to
not have a full understanding of its capabilities.

01:56:11.651 --> 01:56:12.751
"That is dangerous."

01:56:12.752 --> 01:56:16.886
TALIESIN: I think that would be a longer
conversation for when you have time if you feel

01:56:16.886 --> 01:56:21.349
like investing in what we're doing and
how we're moving about the world.

01:56:22.177 --> 01:56:27.878
MARISHA: We mentioned we were not
your ordinary folk. So, as you can see,

01:56:29.518 --> 01:56:32.667
things happen to fall into our lap.

01:56:34.192 --> 01:56:36.079
MATT: "And you bring them to me why?"

01:56:37.445 --> 01:56:38.823
MARISHA: We need allies.

01:56:38.823 --> 01:56:41.391
TALIESIN: We need people who are
better than ourselves.

01:56:43.256 --> 01:56:52.510
MARISHA: As you mentioned, we have very powerful
artifacts that we're not very sure about. But our

01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:58.321
options are turning them over to the empire,
which doesn't seem attractive.

01:56:58.373 --> 01:57:04.100
MATT: "So you are from the Empire. You are of the
Cobalt Soul in Zadash, but you are not aligned

01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:09.565
"with the Dwendalian Empire yourself.
Where are your allegiances?"

01:57:10.516 --> 01:57:11.500
MARISHA: Depends.

01:57:11.588 --> 01:57:12.657
TALIESIN: To the Wildmother.

01:57:14.392 --> 01:57:15.606
MATT: "And you?"

01:57:19.123 --> 01:57:21.365
MARISHA: Depends on who's offering at the time.

01:57:21.365 --> 01:57:25.697
MATT: "So you have no allegiances? You can be
bought any which way, depending on the offer?"

01:57:25.697 --> 01:57:27.409
TALIESIN: She has allegiances to us.

01:57:27.427 --> 01:57:28.247
MARISHA: Correct.

01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:30.713
MATT: "That does not inspire trust."

01:57:31.339 --> 01:57:32.354
MARISHA: I know.

01:57:32.355 --> 01:57:36.438
MATT: "I want to know the individuals that
I would work with can be trusted."

01:57:39.011 --> 01:57:44.540
MARISHA: I tend to like fellow trustworthy people,
even though I'm not necessarily trustworthy

01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:51.420
myself, but, ironically, I fucking hate
untrustworthy people.

01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:59.081
So, if you're down, I'm down,
is what I'm saying.

01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:02.900
MATT: "What are the terms you're offering?"

01:58:07.770 --> 01:58:15.541
TALIESIN: As I've spent some time with these
people, they are people of the world, but I've

01:58:15.554 --> 01:58:24.233
found Ms. Beau and the rest of them to be loyal to
each other, which I find to be a very admirable trait.

01:58:24.233 --> 01:58:28.084
MATT: "But she says she has no loyalty unless
the world pulls her in a direction."

01:58:28.084 --> 01:58:32.139
MARISHA: No! I didn't say I didn't have loyalty.
I said I had loyalty to these people.

01:58:32.147 --> 01:58:36.604
LIAM: Oh god, I need to stress eat. Get it open!

01:58:38.174 --> 01:58:40.269
MATT: "But that is indeed a loyalty, then."

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:50.524
MARISHA: Of course, and I have a few slots
open in my loyalty bank, so if you're

01:58:50.524 --> 01:58:53.684
willing to pay the price of rental--

01:58:53.915 --> 01:59:02.194
MATT: At this point, a voice comes around the
corner from the staircase above that goes, "Sir!

01:59:02.195 --> 01:59:06.572
"Just got some sort of a--" and the goblin
starts running. He goes, "Not now, Wensfeld!"

01:59:07.889 --> 01:59:09.460
Turns back up the steps.

01:59:09.685 --> 01:59:18.249
TALIESIN: Ms. Beau is not as used to speaking
plainly as some of us are. It's okay. One of your

01:59:18.249 --> 01:59:25.470
better attributes is your ability to talk around
something. We need friends. We need assurances.

01:59:25.471 --> 01:59:34.239
We would like to know that you are a good and
trustworthy person and we would, respectfully,

01:59:34.239 --> 01:59:40.734
like to trade, perhaps, some information
and have a friendly face on the coast

01:59:40.734 --> 01:59:42.460
we would be most grateful for.

01:59:42.632 --> 01:59:52.251
MATT: "So what you are saying is you are a band of
unaligned roving mercenaries in search of

01:59:52.253 --> 01:59:56.584
"alliances outside of the political interests
of this current conflict?"

01:59:57.954 --> 01:59:58.765
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:59:58.765 --> 02:00:08.534
TALIESIN: Yes. The others do not know, I believe,
how things may change soon and I think it would be

02:00:08.534 --> 02:00:12.741
good. And I think they're going to turn well. I
think they're going to turn out very well, but I

02:00:12.741 --> 02:00:16.403
think it would be good to have the right
people in the corner when it is time.

02:00:16.403 --> 02:00:19.674
MATT: "Then what do you hope to gain
from my alliance?"

02:00:19.674 --> 02:00:21.631
TALIESIN: Information, for the moment.

02:00:22.672 --> 02:00:23.526
MATT: "About?"

02:00:26.516 --> 02:00:31.613
TALIESIN: About the things in our possession,
powers that we are tapping into,

02:00:31.613 --> 02:00:33.376
the people we may come across.

02:00:33.823 --> 02:00:36.222
MATT: "And eventually what favors
would you be asking?"

02:00:37.114 --> 02:00:42.356
MARISHA: We all know corruption runs rampant
in both the Empire and the Clovis Concord.

02:00:44.277 --> 02:00:49.376
I don't want anything to do with that.
I just want the truth.

02:00:50.225 --> 02:00:52.068
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:00:54.985 --> 02:00:59.354
MARISHA: This is not my fucking best. I'm
better at lying! That's not too bad! 18.

02:01:02.056 --> 02:01:09.344
MATT: You see his right eye just-- and both of
you being relatively insightful people, you see

02:01:09.344 --> 02:01:15.987
just this faint twitch at the corner of the right
eye at the mention of the Concord. He goes,

02:01:24.627 --> 02:01:33.999
"My loyalty is something that is gradually earned.
This is as much as you've earned." And he looks to

02:01:34.014 --> 02:01:40.466
the room. "There are many floors in this tower.
With more loyalty earned, perhaps you'll see more

02:01:40.467 --> 02:01:48.104
"of my tower. But for now," and he looks over to
the door. The door opens up. "The rest of your

02:01:48.103 --> 02:01:51.894
"friends can enter. Let's have a conversation."

02:01:54.454 --> 02:01:56.357
TRAVIS: Did that door just fucking open?

02:01:56.357 --> 02:01:57.279
SAM: I think so.

02:01:57.279 --> 02:02:00.466
LAURA: Can we go in? Does it mean we can go in?
Are they coming out?

02:02:00.466 --> 02:02:01.563
SAM: (crossbow cocking)

02:02:01.563 --> 02:02:02.914
TRAVIS: (falchion summoning)

02:02:03.103 --> 02:02:07.463
LIAM: Caleb puts away the romance novel
that he has sped read halfway through.

02:02:07.835 --> 02:02:10.816
SAM: I drop the fish that I was half-done eating.

02:02:12.181 --> 02:02:20.151
TALIESIN: Our host is aware of our positions and
otherwise. I would ask that everyone try and be

02:02:20.151 --> 02:02:25.582
respectful of the space. Try not to break
anything, steal anything, or otherwise.

02:02:25.582 --> 02:02:28.701
LAURA: Most definitely.

02:02:28.716 --> 02:02:29.785
TALIESIN: Try not to.

02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:33.108
LAURA: I walk in very politely.

02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:35.788
MATT: All right. As you guys enter again,
the rest of the group--

02:02:35.809 --> 02:02:38.110
LIAM: It's the goblin at the door, not this mage?

02:02:38.111 --> 02:02:41.449
MATT: No, the goblin is gone. Literally,
he's still sitting on the couch,

02:02:41.449 --> 02:02:44.282
the door just opened and he's waiting
for you all to enter.

02:02:44.282 --> 02:02:45.622
LIAM: Can we all see him from where we are?

02:02:45.621 --> 02:02:46.313
MATT: Yeah.

02:02:46.313 --> 02:02:47.733
LIAM: Total poker face?

02:02:47.733 --> 02:02:49.282
MATT: Yeah.

02:02:49.282 --> 02:02:51.358
LAURA: (humming)

02:02:51.359 --> 02:02:52.238
SAM: Yeah, let's go in.

02:02:52.287 --> 02:02:54.523
LAURA: (singing) I'm already in the door.

02:02:54.523 --> 02:02:56.636
LIAM: Caleb takes the rear.

02:02:56.636 --> 02:03:04.566
MATT: Okay. So you got a marching order on this?
All right. So you go out to retrieve them.

02:03:04.566 --> 02:03:06.021
You stayed on the couch?

02:03:06.021 --> 02:03:07.793
MARISHA: Did I? Yeah, sure.

02:03:07.792 --> 02:03:09.583
TALIESIN: I stood up and waved everybody in.

02:03:09.583 --> 02:03:10.743
MATT: So you guys are staying.

02:03:10.743 --> 02:03:12.222
TRAVIS: Jester, Nott, Fjord, Caleb.

02:03:12.222 --> 02:03:19.313
MATT: All right. At this point, Yussa closes his
eyes for a second, whispers something. "Welcome to

02:03:19.313 --> 02:03:24.262
"my chambers. So, now that we've gotten some
conversation underway, I would like to know who I

02:03:24.262 --> 02:03:28.259
"am speaking with. You are all what? Who?"

02:03:28.259 --> 02:03:29.853
MARISHA: The Mighty Nein.

02:03:29.853 --> 02:03:31.501
MATT: "Very well."

02:03:31.502 --> 02:03:34.392
TALIESIN: Oh!

02:03:34.392 --> 02:03:41.310
MATT: "Don't even attempt. You are?"

02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:44.886
TRAVIS: I'm Fjord.

02:03:44.886 --> 02:03:45.935
MATT: "Fjord."

02:03:45.935 --> 02:03:47.251
MARISHA: Beauregard.

02:03:47.251 --> 02:03:48.800
LIAM: I'm Caleb Widogast.

02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:54.367
SAM: I'm Nott.

02:03:54.367 --> 02:03:57.949
LAURA: Jester Lavore.

02:03:57.949 --> 02:04:02.019
TALIESIN: And I'm Caduceus.
Again, it's a pleasure.

02:04:02.019 --> 02:04:14.892
MATT: Yasha just gives a nod. "Yasha." "I am Yussa
Errenis. I am the owner of the Open Quay, and I

02:04:14.892 --> 02:04:23.571
"have been a practitioner of the arcane arts in
seclusion for over 200 years. You carry with you

02:04:23.571 --> 02:04:29.462
"something that is very dangerous and I would very
much like to stay here, because the longer it's on

02:04:29.462 --> 02:04:35.788
"your persons, the larger chance there is you
misuse it and destroy yourselves, or it falls in

02:04:35.789 --> 02:04:37.752
"the hands of someone who should not have it."

02:04:37.752 --> 02:04:40.047
LAURA: We almost died in there.

02:04:40.047 --> 02:04:42.006
MATT: "Case in point."

02:04:42.006 --> 02:04:44.678
TRAVIS: I'm assuming he's talking about
the Happy Fun Ball?

02:04:44.678 --> 02:04:46.000
MATT: Yes.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:53.634
TALIESIN: I would ask, just so that it doesn't
get me into trouble with my compatriots

02:04:53.634 --> 02:04:58.110
that I convinced that honesty and
forthrightness was the best policy--

02:04:58.110 --> 02:05:02.650
MATT: "Should you wish to come and discuss
or see it, or we can compare notes

02:05:02.650 --> 02:05:04.493
"on our experiences, you know where it is."

02:05:04.494 --> 02:05:09.072
TALIESIN: I was hoping for, perhaps, a trade so
that they felt that they got something back in

02:05:09.072 --> 02:05:13.384
return. It doesn't have to, obviously, be so
dangerous. If you have something that at least

02:05:13.384 --> 02:05:16.377
they can feel like they can hold something
in the meantime.

02:05:16.377 --> 02:05:20.049
MATT: "This was something that did not belong to
you to begin with that came into your possession

02:05:20.049 --> 02:05:25.616
"from a third party, and you are just the current
custodian of it and nearly got yourself killed.

02:05:25.616 --> 02:05:32.090
"I am doing you a favor. I will study it. I will keep
it here where it's safe. If you have need of it,

02:05:32.090 --> 02:05:37.668
"if you need to come look at it, or wish to
learn of its secrets, do so in my presence,

02:05:37.784 --> 02:05:40.699
"where it can be done safely."

02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:43.861
MARISHA: How about a non-monetary exchange?

02:05:43.861 --> 02:05:47.281
MATT: "You."

02:05:47.281 --> 02:05:48.771
LIAM: Hmm.

02:05:48.771 --> 02:05:56.026
MATT: "It looks like within your coat you are
holding tomes. Are you a practitioner of the

02:05:56.026 --> 02:05:57.979
"arcane arts yourself?"

02:05:57.979 --> 02:05:59.793
LIAM: Hmm.

02:05:59.793 --> 02:06:06.796
MATT: "Have you the capabilities to transport your
compatriots via circles of arcane nature?"

02:06:06.796 --> 02:06:12.729
LIAM: Via circles of arc-- Transportation, you mean
to jump from one city to another? That sort of thing?

02:06:12.729 --> 02:06:14.090
MATT: "Yes."

02:06:14.090 --> 02:06:15.726
LIAM: Not as of yet.

02:06:15.726 --> 02:06:18.409
SAM: But he learns very fast.

02:06:18.409 --> 02:06:20.140
LAURA: Can you teach him?

02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:27.595
MATT: "I may perhaps have something like that,
but at the very least I do keep such a circle

02:06:27.595 --> 02:06:31.378
"reserved for the select friends I keep."

02:06:31.379 --> 02:06:32.823
LIAM: Here in your home?

02:06:32.823 --> 02:06:41.686
MATT: "Yes. So, as part of our trust of me
keeping this sphere, you would be granted the

02:06:41.686 --> 02:06:49.971
"capabilities, once you are able to make this
journey, to return here with your friends. You

02:06:49.971 --> 02:06:56.902
"would have an anchor here on the coast and you
would be under my protection when you arrive.

02:06:56.902 --> 02:07:01.913
"Does that seem like a fair trade, those
who seek friends and allies?"

02:07:01.913 --> 02:07:06.566
TRAVIS: I have no objection.

02:07:06.566 --> 02:07:08.835
SAM: Seems very fair, yes!

02:07:08.835 --> 02:07:10.814
LAURA: How long until you can do
something like that, Caleb?

02:07:10.814 --> 02:07:13.104
SAM: Probably any day. He reads a lot of books.

02:07:13.104 --> 02:07:18.294
MARISHA: Do you have any type of scrolls
or spell books--

02:07:18.294 --> 02:07:19.999
LAURA: Or candy.

02:07:19.999 --> 02:07:27.467
MARISHA: Or candy that you could lend to Caleb's
aid, further advancing his ability to learn that?

02:07:27.467 --> 02:07:30.969
TALIESIN: I'm, by the way, already putting the
ball on the table and leaving it by the tea tray

02:07:30.969 --> 02:07:34.008
as we have this discussion. I have definitely
moved it to the center of the room.

02:07:34.008 --> 02:07:38.086
MATT: Okay. He takes it and lifts it,
inspects it.

02:07:38.086 --> 02:07:41.596
TALIESIN: We can let you know what we saw inside.

02:07:41.596 --> 02:07:43.635
MATT: He wraps it into his robe.

02:07:43.635 --> 02:07:45.420
LAURA: It drops gold sometimes, though.

02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:51.274
MATT: The robe, you watch as he places it over the
sphere and the shape beneath just dissipates.

02:07:51.274 --> 02:07:54.777
LIAM: You have some knowledge of
where that leads?

02:07:54.777 --> 02:08:00.771
MATT: "Of where this leads? I do. And
the mage it once belonged to."

02:08:00.771 --> 02:08:03.622
LIAM: You know him personally?

02:08:03.622 --> 02:08:09.184
MATT: "No, I do not know him personally, but there
are few in my circles that have not heard of his

02:08:09.184 --> 02:08:11.609
"exploits in the past."

02:08:11.610 --> 02:08:13.913
LAURA: Was he a good guy or a bad guy?

02:08:13.913 --> 02:08:20.578
MATT: "At a certain level of arcane practitioning,
morality becomes a bit ambiguous, but to the

02:08:20.578 --> 02:08:28.626
"common man, I would say probably
not a very team player."

02:08:28.626 --> 02:08:33.167
TALIESIN: Did we ever get confirmation
on the owner's death or did we not?

02:08:33.167 --> 02:08:35.411
SAM: No, we just assumed.

02:08:35.411 --> 02:08:38.602
LAURA: Yeah, because his pet dragon hadn't
seen him in a long time or something.

02:08:38.603 --> 02:08:51.417
MATT: "And yes, I do have access to various
spells, but I've earned them. I'm willing to share

02:08:51.417 --> 02:08:58.222
"knowledge based on the development of our
friendship and proven loyalty."

02:08:58.222 --> 02:09:02.167
SAM: How do we prove our loyalty?

02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:05.922
MATT: "By not fucking me over."

02:09:05.923 --> 02:09:10.368
SAM: We've been here the whole afternoon.
We haven't fucked you over once!

02:09:10.368 --> 02:09:12.633
LAURA: We gave you a cool ball.

02:09:12.633 --> 02:09:21.625
MATT: "You did, and I made a trade of information
and a safe haven. When you find more information

02:09:21.625 --> 02:09:26.752
"like this, and more items like this, bring them
back to me. There may be times where, perhaps, I

02:09:26.752 --> 02:09:33.873
"could use some help in doing things that I'm not
comfortable leaving my tower for. Maybe you could

02:09:33.873 --> 02:09:39.325
"be of aid in that case. There will be
opportunities, I'm sure, to earn more trust."

02:09:39.326 --> 02:09:43.763
LIAM: Caleb extends his hand out slowly.

02:09:45.553 --> 02:09:49.709
MATT: "Sad one."

02:09:49.710 --> 02:09:53.868
LIAM: Thank you.

02:09:53.952 --> 02:10:00.381
MATT: "But you have to earn."

02:10:00.381 --> 02:10:09.096
TRAVIS: Is there anything that we can do
for you in the short term?

02:10:09.096 --> 02:10:11.401
SAM: Anything to keep an eye out for?

02:10:11.401 --> 02:10:17.019
MATT: "I would like very much to see this
other... thing that you have come across. If this

02:10:17.019 --> 02:10:24.604
"is a powerful artifact, I am very curious as to
what other geometric shapes you've come across."

02:10:24.604 --> 02:10:33.486
TALIESIN: That we-- I think we feel also would be
something that we would be interested in doing

02:10:33.487 --> 02:10:38.760
once we feel even more comfortable with
this arrangement, and once trust is built.

02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:41.195
LIAM: Once you have earned our trust.

02:10:41.195 --> 02:10:45.109
TALIESIN: Obviously, you are so much more
powerful than we are that it would

02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:50.005
behoove us to be a little careful.

02:10:50.005 --> 02:10:53.633
LAURA: Yeah, you could probably just kill us
right now if you wanted to.

02:10:53.633 --> 02:10:55.405
TALIESIN: I mean, really, he probably could.

02:10:55.406 --> 02:10:57.423
MATT: "You are not incorrect."

02:10:57.423 --> 02:11:03.135
LIAM: This one has sentimental value.
It is not to be left here.

02:11:03.135 --> 02:11:13.725
MATT: "Well, might I at least possibly inquire as
to what it is capable of? You may not know the

02:11:13.725 --> 02:11:19.026
"dangers you carry with you as you obviously
did not understand of this sphere."

02:11:19.026 --> 02:11:21.747
LIAM: We have a better understanding of this one.

02:11:21.747 --> 02:11:25.601
MARISHA: As traveling mercenaries,
we're used to being in danger.

02:11:25.602 --> 02:11:27.668
MATT: "Very well."

02:11:27.668 --> 02:11:30.842
LAURA: It makes babies.

02:11:30.842 --> 02:11:34.654
MARISHA: (quietly) It does.

02:11:34.654 --> 02:11:37.016
SAM: Well, they talked about-- yeah.

02:11:37.016 --> 02:11:39.519
TALIESIN: I have a--

02:11:39.519 --> 02:11:45.135
MATT: "You have a geometric shape
that makes babies?"

02:11:45.135 --> 02:11:46.706
LAURA: Yeah.

02:11:46.706 --> 02:11:48.874
TALIESIN: Would it be possible to get an
assurance that we could leave this place

02:11:48.874 --> 02:11:50.647
with it and that no harm would come to us?

02:11:50.648 --> 02:11:54.580
TRAVIS: Well, I think if he knew that
it helps us on our exploits--

02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:55.878
TALIESIN: It does.

02:11:55.878 --> 02:11:58.288
TRAVIS: Which thereby helps him. I mean,
we are sharing, aren't we?

02:11:58.288 --> 02:12:01.907
TALIESIN: I'm willing to take a certain
person at their word.

02:12:01.907 --> 02:12:06.942
LIAM: I take him at his word that he could
kill us all if he wanted to. If he wanted

02:12:06.942 --> 02:12:12.214
to take it against our will, he would.
I am comfortable with you examining it,

02:12:12.214 --> 02:12:16.090
but we don't wish to leave it here.
We wish to bring it with us when we leave.

02:12:16.090 --> 02:12:25.758
TALIESIN: No matter what. Also, we would
appreciate it if you would not speak of who owns

02:12:25.758 --> 02:12:31.071
this artifact with anyone. If you have to discuss
the artifact, that's one thing, but we would

02:12:31.071 --> 02:12:43.646
prefer us to be anonymous. It's a dangerous
world. And it would show great trust.

02:12:43.646 --> 02:12:52.495
MATT: "I am generally uncomfortable in
making deals regarding passing glances at

02:12:52.495 --> 02:13:02.346
"world-shattering artifacts, if that be the case, but
you have blessed me with some fine tea this day."

02:13:02.346 --> 02:13:06.761
TALIESIN: Bring more the next time I go
home, if there's a home to go to.

02:13:06.761 --> 02:13:10.922
MATT: "You have my assurance. And if it is indeed
such a dangerous item and you wish to carry it

02:13:10.922 --> 02:13:17.014
"with you, then woe be unto you.
So. Let me see it."

02:13:17.014 --> 02:13:20.328
LAURA: Really? Are we sure about this?

02:13:20.328 --> 02:13:22.497
TALIESIN: It's time to trust somebody.

02:13:22.497 --> 02:13:24.578
SAM: We're all in.

02:13:24.578 --> 02:13:27.426
TALIESIN: It's the iron safe, and then-- yeah.

02:13:27.426 --> 02:13:30.263
TRAVIS: (singing) Give us a helping hand.

02:13:30.323 --> 02:13:34.676
SAM: Did you already look at it today?

02:13:34.676 --> 02:13:36.221
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:13:36.221 --> 02:13:40.481
MATT: Takes it and begins to cast a spell
that you recognize as an Identify spell.

02:13:40.481 --> 02:13:56.087
Casts another spell that you don't recognize.
(sighs) Takes a moment and concentrates on it,

02:13:56.087 --> 02:14:01.330
and you watch his face go slack-- a familiar
expression that many of you have seen

02:14:01.330 --> 02:14:03.419
your friends as they concentrate on it do so.

02:14:03.419 --> 02:14:04.661
TRAVIS: Now!

02:14:04.661 --> 02:14:12.214
(laughter)

02:14:12.214 --> 02:14:15.566
MATT: Aww, it'll be so disappointing when
they pass through the illusion.

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.549
LAURA: Oh!

02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:24.417
MATT: You don't know. You think a mage lets
people into his living room unprotected,

02:14:24.417 --> 02:14:28.194
are you kidding me? You don't live as long
as he has without some sort of backup.

02:14:28.194 --> 02:14:30.656
TALIESIN: I got Banishment on hold, just in case.

02:14:30.657 --> 02:14:40.612
MATT: About a minute passes, and then the muscles
in his face tighten back into his neutral

02:14:40.612 --> 02:14:59.948
expression. "This is-- I have studied much, and
this is new to me. I'd be worried if this was

02:14:59.948 --> 02:15:08.352
"something dangerous that I knew and understood
well. I find it far more concerning that this is

02:15:08.352 --> 02:15:18.500
"something I know nothing of. Where was
this found?"

02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:23.444
MARISHA: Zadash. After the Spire attack.

02:15:23.444 --> 02:15:25.778
TRAVIS: In the hands of an assassin.

02:15:25.778 --> 02:15:33.614
MARISHA: Either it was in the Tri-Spire
and they successfully exited with it,

02:15:33.614 --> 02:15:38.822
or the Xhorhasian were trafficking it.

02:15:38.822 --> 02:15:44.562
LAURA: I think the Tri-Spire stole it from the
Xhorhasians and they were trying to get it back.

02:15:44.562 --> 02:15:46.812
MARISHA: That's what we believe.

02:15:46.812 --> 02:16:04.227
MATT: "Very interesting. (sighs) Whatever magic
this is, it blends elements of arcane and divine,

02:16:04.228 --> 02:16:14.064
"but is outside of what I know, can sense.
It's very alien."

02:16:14.064 --> 02:16:26.046
MARISHA: Yussa, do you know of the Empire, the
Clovis Concord, stealing artifacts from other shores?

02:16:26.046 --> 02:16:36.676
MATT: "I mean, if there is any sort of dominion
to hold, you take what is available. I mean,

02:16:36.676 --> 02:16:44.680
"everything as far as Vasselheim to Emon to
Ank'Harel. Anyone in power has their threads and

02:16:44.681 --> 02:16:49.965
"eyes out for what could possibly help them
maintain their positions in power and what dangers

02:16:49.965 --> 02:16:55.816
"there are out there. That is beyond morality, that
is just simple intelligence to survive in a world

02:16:55.816 --> 02:17:03.250
"that is continuously beset by darker powers and
things beyond our control. If this was taken

02:17:03.250 --> 02:17:06.263
"from Xhorhas, then god knows what they
were attempting to do with it."

02:17:06.263 --> 02:17:08.096
LAURA: Make babies.

02:17:08.096 --> 02:17:09.902
MATT: "Make babies."

02:17:09.902 --> 02:17:12.224
LAURA: Well, that's what the guy said.

02:17:12.224 --> 02:17:15.400
LIAM: Very bad people want this thing.

02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:19.979
MATT: "Then very bad people will be after you."

02:17:19.979 --> 02:17:22.474
SAM: Well, we're also sometimes bad people, so.

02:17:22.475 --> 02:17:30.336
MATT: "That does not necessarily mean you're
protected. Just be careful."

02:17:30.417 --> 02:17:35.783
LAURA: Do you have any ways to protect us?
Right now, we're keeping it in this bag.

02:17:35.783 --> 02:17:40.126
Do you have any better way to keep it secret?

02:17:40.126 --> 02:17:46.811
MATT: "I think that is probably the best method
you have. Remove it only when absolutely necessary

02:17:46.811 --> 02:17:54.366
"and for short periods of time. That will protect
from divination on this plane, but only this plane."

02:17:54.366 --> 02:17:57.870
LAURA: Oh, right. Okay.

02:17:57.871 --> 02:18:06.148
TALIESIN: That's very good to know. I hope that,
now that you understand how much we appreciate

02:18:06.148 --> 02:18:09.239
your gesture of trust, and how much--

02:18:09.239 --> 02:18:11.379
LAURA: (quietly) That's my name.

02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:16.697
TALIESIN: Jester of trust. And how much
we are putting our faith that you are on

02:18:16.697 --> 02:18:19.754
the side of good and right, if--

02:18:19.754 --> 02:18:23.140
MATT: "I did not say I'm on the side of good
and right. I am on the side of maintaining

02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:27.852
"a balance in which society can exist."

02:18:27.853 --> 02:18:29.611
TALIESIN: That'll do.

02:18:29.611 --> 02:18:31.848
MARISHA: We haven't showed--

02:18:31.848 --> 02:18:34.721
LAURA: (gasps) Have you ever heard
of the Traveler?

02:18:34.721 --> 02:18:37.117
MATT: "No."

02:18:37.117 --> 02:18:41.766
LAURA: I look in my bag and I get out
a little figure that I made of him.

02:18:41.766 --> 02:18:46.435
MATT: "I have no idea what this is."

02:18:46.435 --> 02:18:50.634
LAURA: He's really big on balance too. Here, I'll
leave it for you. That's also a present, okay?

02:18:50.634 --> 02:18:53.724
SAM: Do you want to leave a pamphlet too,
so he can find out more information?

02:18:53.724 --> 02:18:59.092
LAURA: Yeah, okay. There we go.
I'll stick it under the-- there you go.

02:18:59.092 --> 02:19:00.893
MATT: He's glancing to you all, like--

02:19:00.893 --> 02:19:03.334
SAM: She does this a lot.

02:19:03.334 --> 02:19:05.074
TRAVIS: Yeah, she talks to him.

02:19:05.074 --> 02:19:06.508
MATT: "Thank you."

02:19:06.508 --> 02:19:08.588
LAURA: He's really powerful!

02:19:08.588 --> 02:19:10.000
MATT: "I'm sure."

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:18.836
TALIESIN: We would appreciate any information
that you may glean about this, Uk'otoa, Traveler,

02:19:18.836 --> 02:19:29.418
the Blooming Grove. I am of the belief that these
things are connected, that these chaotic forces

02:19:29.418 --> 02:19:33.258
are moving towards something unsettling
and unbalancing.

02:19:33.353 --> 02:19:44.064
MATT: "Then I will do my best to do what I can on
my end of things. Well, that's been my morning tea."

02:19:44.064 --> 02:19:47.195
SAM: Thank you for your time.

02:19:47.195 --> 02:19:55.419
MATT: "Well, we have one more business to attend.
Follow me. The rest of you," and he waves his hand

02:19:55.419 --> 02:20:00.740
across the table, and on the side of
the platter where the teacups were,

02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:04.306
this conjured plate of biscuits appears.

02:20:04.306 --> 02:20:06.017
LAURA: Yay!

02:20:06.017 --> 02:20:08.118
MATT: "Enjoy."

02:20:08.118 --> 02:20:11.418
TRAVIS: And you die.

02:20:11.418 --> 02:20:14.367
MATT: He walks away, gesturing for you to follow.

02:20:14.367 --> 02:20:16.238
LAURA: That's my name!

02:20:16.238 --> 02:20:18.092
LIAM: I'll promptly follow.

02:20:18.093 --> 02:20:24.102
MATT: You head up the stairs. Doesn't say a word
to you. It curls around and around for a good two

02:20:24.102 --> 02:20:36.796
minutes. No windows, very little light. The
occasional similar sparkling globe emitting a low

02:20:36.796 --> 02:20:41.679
torchlight until eventually, you come to another
door. The staircase continues upward in a spiral,

02:20:41.679 --> 02:20:49.790
but there's a doorway to the right and a small
landing. It opens. He enters, and you enter with

02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:55.837
him. This chamber-- it is a small domed room,
maybe about 15 feet across, and it is

02:20:55.837 --> 02:21:00.079
circular on the base. It domes to the top,
and there is no other exit.

02:21:00.079 --> 02:21:02.413
TRAVIS: Just him and Caleb, right?

02:21:02.414 --> 02:21:04.442
MATT: Mm-hmm. You enter?

02:21:04.442 --> 02:21:05.650
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;.

02:21:05.650 --> 02:21:14.292
MATT: The door closes. Darkness. All of a sudden,
you see a rune above you that emits a bright blue

02:21:14.586 --> 02:21:23.739
light that lights the chamber. Everything is in
shades of blue. He gestures to the floor, and as

02:21:23.739 --> 02:21:29.193
you glance down, you can see now, where the
blue light hits, this large, runic circle that

02:21:29.193 --> 02:21:37.027
encompasses the entire chamber is now
glowing in response. You recognize it. This is

02:21:37.027 --> 02:21:47.896
a teleportation circle. This is a receiving
teleportation circle. He looks to you.

02:21:47.896 --> 02:21:49.125
LIAM: One way?

02:21:49.239 --> 02:21:56.302
MATT: He says, "There are transports I have in
other parts of this tower to different places.

02:21:56.302 --> 02:22:05.736
"Earning my trust, perhaps, you may gain more
access. But for now, you have a place to return to.

02:22:05.737 --> 02:22:19.820
"How much time do you need?" He gestures
to the symbol. "To memorize it."

02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:30.235
LIAM: Oh. DM question: I don't know what
level, off the top of my head, Teleportation--

02:22:30.235 --> 02:22:32.203
MATT: I believe it's 5th-level.

02:22:32.203 --> 02:22:34.787
LIAM: So how much time?

02:22:34.788 --> 02:22:42.180
MATT: This isn't the spell; this is the
receiving rune. When you learn the spell,

02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:45.114
you can use that spell to return here.

02:22:45.114 --> 02:22:46.524
LIAM: Right.

02:22:46.524 --> 02:22:48.307
MATT: Do you have access to the spell?

02:22:48.308 --> 02:22:51.409
LIAM: No. Oh! Sorry.

02:22:51.409 --> 02:22:55.366
MATT: You can either choose it at a higher
level when you decide to go up--

02:22:55.366 --> 02:23:02.906
LIAM: Yes, I do have it, but it would
take me a lot of hours.

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:05.469
LAURA: But you can memorize the rune.

02:23:05.469 --> 02:23:08.527
LIAM: I mean, he would look at it for
a minute and have the rune in his head.

02:23:08.527 --> 02:23:18.885
MATT: Then there you go. When you finish, he goes,
"A quick learner. Good to know. Where did you train?"

02:23:18.885 --> 02:23:26.557
LIAM: Mostly on my own, to be honest.
For years.

02:23:26.557 --> 02:23:36.475
MATT: "Impressive. You have a talented eye
for picking up arcanic sigils and glyphs."

02:23:36.475 --> 02:23:44.526
LIAM: It was not my intention to bother
you here. My friends were very curious.

02:23:44.526 --> 02:23:46.645
MATT: "That they are."

02:23:46.645 --> 02:23:57.140
LIAM: It was fairly obvious to me that this building
was real estate owned by someone of great skill.

02:23:57.140 --> 02:24:03.430
MATT: "It is designed to keep people like
you out, but sometimes, tenacity makes

02:24:03.431 --> 02:24:06.677
"for interesting breakfast conversations."

02:24:06.677 --> 02:24:11.077
LIAM: I actually thought it was a very
bad idea to come here.

02:24:11.077 --> 02:24:15.716
MATT: "It was. But you came anyway, and
look where you are."

02:24:15.717 --> 02:24:21.125
LIAM: Sometimes follow my friends
places I shouldn't.

02:24:21.125 --> 02:24:28.491
MATT: "That might one day get you killed.
Or may one day get you what you seek."

02:24:28.491 --> 02:24:43.208
LIAM: Well, my apologies on my group's
presumptuousness. I hope that we have not

02:24:43.208 --> 02:24:52.510
made a grave error here today, and if we
haven't, I hope to earn that trust, as you say.

02:24:52.510 --> 02:25:08.365
MATT: "I've lived quite a long while, and the only
reason I've lived this long is I have made allies.

02:25:08.365 --> 02:25:22.039
"I followed them into sometimes stupid, unnecessary
circumstances. Many of them died helping me. Many

02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:31.826
"of them I outlived. But I wouldn't be where I am
today if I didn't at least trust in the power of others."

02:25:35.666 --> 02:25:38.178
LIAM: That's good advice.

02:25:38.178 --> 02:25:50.333
MATT: "Use who you need to, but know, everyone can
be useful if you can mete out their skills."

02:25:50.382 --> 02:26:03.948
LIAM: (sighs) I'm sure you have much to do today.

02:26:04.038 --> 02:26:06.909
MATT: "I'm sure you do as well." The
door behind you opens up again,

02:26:06.909 --> 02:26:10.020
the light turns dark, and the stairway's
behind you.

02:26:10.021 --> 02:26:15.322
LIAM: Feel for the wall.

02:26:15.322 --> 02:26:22.244
MATT: Eventually, you find your way to the staircase;
the faint light below guides you to the exit.

02:26:22.244 --> 02:26:27.064
LIAM: That eventually spills out down here?

02:26:27.064 --> 02:26:30.342
MATT: Yeah, eventually leads you back down to
the chamber. You guys are down there waiting.

02:26:30.342 --> 02:26:32.813
TALIESIN: I saved you a biscuit.

02:26:32.813 --> 02:26:34.119
SAM: These biscuits are real good.

02:26:34.119 --> 02:26:35.939
LAURA: There's cinnamon in 'em!

02:26:35.939 --> 02:26:37.477
LIAM: Cinnamon-a-mon-a-mon.

02:26:37.477 --> 02:26:41.837
MATT: Uniquely, each biscuit tastes different. It
is specially designed for your personal interests.

02:26:41.837 --> 02:26:44.318
SAM: Mine tastes like fish!

02:26:44.318 --> 02:26:50.068
(laughter)

02:26:50.068 --> 02:26:52.965
MARISHA: Oh, bourbon.

02:26:52.965 --> 02:26:56.392
LAURA: Bourbon biscuit? That's delicious.

02:26:56.392 --> 02:26:57.979
MARISHA: It sounds really good!

02:26:57.979 --> 02:27:00.494
LAURA: Honestly, a fish biscuit
doesn't sound terrible.

02:27:00.495 --> 02:27:02.870
MARISHA: It's like a Red Lobster biscuit.

02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:05.449
TALIESIN: A lobster biscuit? That a thing?

02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:08.761
SAM: Well, thanks.

02:27:08.761 --> 02:27:11.232
LAURA: Lobster?

02:27:11.232 --> 02:27:13.604
TALIESIN: Lobster biscuit is a thing?

02:27:13.604 --> 02:27:16.283
MARISHA: Some places call them lobster rolls.

02:27:16.283 --> 02:27:20.638
LIAM: Come on. We are quitting while we're ahead,
let's go. Oh, streusel.

02:27:20.639 --> 02:27:24.768
MATT: You guys exit the tower, closes behind you.

02:27:24.845 --> 02:27:26.739
SAM and MARISHA: How'd it go? How'd it go?

02:27:26.739 --> 02:27:28.638
SAM: What new spell do you know?

02:27:28.639 --> 02:27:30.542
LAURA: What did you do? What'd you learn?
What did he sell you?

02:27:30.542 --> 02:27:32.417
SAM: I feel his forehead. Does he
have a third eye?

02:27:32.417 --> 02:27:35.341
LAURA: Did you see a cool room or anything?
Maybe multiple rooms?

02:27:35.341 --> 02:27:37.247
MARISHA: Was it made of marble?

02:27:37.247 --> 02:27:44.370
LAURA: What did he talk to you about? Did
he talk at all or was he just like, "Hmm?"

02:27:44.371 --> 02:27:47.097
TRAVIS: Hey, Caleb. What happened in there?

02:27:47.097 --> 02:27:51.331
(laughter)

02:27:51.331 --> 02:27:53.301
LIAM: We talked about you guys, actually.

02:27:53.301 --> 02:27:56.399
LAURA: What did you say? Did you say we're
really cool and you love us so much?

02:27:56.399 --> 02:27:58.557
TALIESIN: He said we were foolish.

02:27:58.558 --> 02:28:01.950
LIAM: I didn't say anything. I listened.

02:28:01.950 --> 02:28:03.974
TALIESIN: He said we were foolish.

02:28:03.974 --> 02:28:05.952
LIAM: No.

02:28:05.952 --> 02:28:09.136
TALIESIN: I don't believe you.

02:28:09.137 --> 02:28:13.797
LIAM: I say you are foolish.

02:28:13.797 --> 02:28:15.696
TALIESIN: It's true.

02:28:15.696 --> 02:28:21.786
SAM: Well, that was great! We got everything;
it was exactly what I said! We would go in,

02:28:21.786 --> 02:28:26.777
we'd get some magic for you, we'd get
some knowledge. Good job, Beau!

02:28:26.777 --> 02:28:29.430
LIAM: We are lucky that we are not dead!

02:28:29.430 --> 02:28:32.329
MARISHA: Thank you. I could barely speak;
I could barely get words out.

02:28:32.329 --> 02:28:35.385
LAURA: He did a great job, apparently!
What, the door opened, you guys.

02:28:35.385 --> 02:28:36.923
SAM: Caduceus, good job!

02:28:36.923 --> 02:28:42.067
TALIESIN: We are lucky we're not dead. But we are
also lucky that, going forward, we're going to get

02:28:42.067 --> 02:28:47.688
you access to learn more and to grow in an avenue
you didn't have open to you before.

02:28:47.688 --> 02:28:52.083
MARISHA: See, access! That's what
I said earlier! He's smart.

02:28:52.083 --> 02:28:59.587
TALIESIN: I think he's going to be a-- if he isn't
the death of us, I think he's going to be a good

02:28:59.587 --> 02:29:09.104
ally. But something's going to be the death of
us and it's better just to trust a few people.

02:29:09.104 --> 02:29:13.870
MARISHA: You met a rockstar and you
look like you want to barf.

02:29:13.871 --> 02:29:17.612
LAURA: (singing) It was so cool. You
learned something new.

02:29:17.645 --> 02:29:19.827
SAM: (monkey noises)

02:29:19.827 --> 02:29:25.100
MARISHA: Access. The international sign
for entrance, for let me in.

02:29:25.101 --> 02:29:30.591
LIAM: We're very lucky the way it worked out.
You can't bullshit everyone in this world.

02:29:30.591 --> 02:29:32.611
TALIESIN: We didn't bullshit.

02:29:32.611 --> 02:29:33.954
LIAM: We got luck--

02:29:33.954 --> 02:29:37.517
TALIESIN: I will actually--

02:29:37.517 --> 02:29:41.108
LIAM: How did it go? What kind of conversation
did you have before we got in there?

02:29:41.108 --> 02:29:42.930
What did you guys talk about?

02:29:42.930 --> 02:29:47.335
TALIESIN: I watched Beau tell the truth.
It was very impressive. You're not very

02:29:47.335 --> 02:29:49.172
good at it, but it was very impressive.

02:29:49.172 --> 02:29:50.704
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:29:50.704 --> 02:29:52.011
TALIESIN: Yeah, I could tell you were struggling.

02:29:52.011 --> 02:29:59.100
MARISHA: It started out as a half-truth. We got
there without exposing anything too deeply.

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:01.726
TALIESIN: You were honest without oversharing.

02:30:01.726 --> 02:30:03.416
MARISHA: He might think we work for the Empire.

02:30:03.416 --> 02:30:05.322
TRAVIS: You expose yourself?

02:30:05.322 --> 02:30:10.628
MARISHA: Oh no, not like that. Thought about
it, though. Worst case scenario, flash a guy,

02:30:10.628 --> 02:30:12.224
see what happens.

02:30:12.224 --> 02:30:14.209
LAURA: Tell him about your open slots.

02:30:14.209 --> 02:30:17.448
MARISHA: I did tell him-- wait, I did tell
him about-- how'd you know that, Jester?!

02:30:17.448 --> 02:30:21.016
Am I talking about my slots too much?

02:30:21.095 --> 02:30:22.834
LAURA: You talk about slots a lot.

02:30:22.835 --> 02:30:24.058
MARISHA: Fuck.

02:30:24.058 --> 02:30:32.632
SAM: Well, now what? What place-- what tower do we
break into next? What do we get out of here?

02:30:32.632 --> 02:30:35.296
LAURA: I mean, honestly, Nott.

02:30:35.296 --> 02:30:37.137
SAM: Hmm?

02:30:37.137 --> 02:30:40.998
LAURA: Isn't, you know, your hometown
in a little bit of danger?

02:30:40.998 --> 02:30:46.191
SAM: Oh, is it? I hadn't been thinking
about that every day. But yeah, it is.

02:30:46.192 --> 02:30:48.817
LAURA: I mean, maybe we should, you know?

02:30:48.817 --> 02:30:51.627
SAM: Wait, don't you want to spend more
time with your momsies?

02:30:51.627 --> 02:30:59.027
LAURA: Well, of course I do, but my Mama's here and
people you care about could be in danger.

02:30:59.534 --> 02:31:02.452
SAM: Well, we could swing by, I wouldn't be
opposed to that. But--

02:31:02.452 --> 02:31:07.286
LIAM: But let's stay in one place for a few days
first, right? Before moving on. That way we could

02:31:07.287 --> 02:31:12.345
stay a few days when we get there. Don't want to
run off. Your mother misses you; she wants

02:31:12.345 --> 02:31:15.034
to see you. She wants to spend time with you.

02:31:15.034 --> 02:31:17.833
LAURA: Well yes, of course, Caleb, but
people could be in danger.

02:31:17.834 --> 02:31:21.915
TRAVIS: She has a good point. I thought we'd
hurry back so that we could check.

02:31:21.915 --> 02:31:27.064
LIAM: One more day. Or you'll regret it.

02:31:27.064 --> 02:31:33.746
LAURA: Only if it's okay with everyone.
I could always catch up with you all.

02:31:33.746 --> 02:31:40.273
TALIESIN: We're going to need a day to get
ourselves together anyway. We don't have--

02:31:40.273 --> 02:31:45.352
we're going to have to put everything together.
So why don't you just--

02:31:45.352 --> 02:31:46.906
LAURA: One more night.

02:31:46.906 --> 02:31:50.468
TALIESIN: Why don't you just spend some time
with your family and we'll get the cart together

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:52.605
and get the supplies together--

02:31:52.605 --> 02:31:53.751
LAURA: Set off in the morning?

02:31:53.751 --> 02:31:54.871
SAM: That's fine with me.

02:31:54.871 --> 02:31:55.848
TALIESIN: Set off.

02:31:55.848 --> 02:31:56.780
LAURA: Yeah?

02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:57.714
MARISHA: Yeah. Good with me.

02:31:57.714 --> 02:31:59.030
TRAVIS: Sounds like a deal.

02:31:59.030 --> 02:32:01.026
LAURA: All right.

02:32:01.026 --> 02:32:10.029
LIAM: Just for future plans and operations, a mage
of that skill level will know if a familiar is--

02:32:10.778 --> 02:32:19.764
if someone is staring at him. He invited two
in, not three. Here's my cat (poof). Out here.

02:32:19.764 --> 02:32:24.116
That was not a good idea. I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

02:32:24.116 --> 02:32:26.450
TALIESIN: You made a good call.

02:32:26.450 --> 02:32:28.030
MARISHA: Caleb.

02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:29.672
LIAM: Yeah?

02:32:29.672 --> 02:32:49.929
MARISHA: I didn't lie to him. Not really, anyway,
so, believe what you want. And I &lt;i&gt;walk away&lt;/i&gt;.

02:32:49.929 --> 02:32:52.789
LAURA: (singing) Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:32:52.789 --> 02:33:02.252
MATT: All right. In the rest of the day that comes
about, lest you have any other particular plans to

02:33:02.252 --> 02:33:12.940
deal with, you get to spend the remainder of this
day and the evening with your mother. You guys can

02:33:12.940 --> 02:33:18.441
pick out your food and supplies for the road. If
you're wishing to purchase things, we'll say for

02:33:18.441 --> 02:33:23.608
the bulk of your journey-- I mean, making stops
along the way, at least to get you from Nicodranas

02:33:23.608 --> 02:33:27.113
to Trostenwald. We'll say if you're heading--
are you heading by way of Zadash

02:33:27.113 --> 02:33:31.238
to Felderwin or are you crossing over
from Alfield to Felderwin?

02:33:31.238 --> 02:33:34.170
LAURA: What are we doing? Fjord?

02:33:34.170 --> 02:33:37.515
TRAVIS: We go through the Wuyun Gates.
Trostenwald. Zadash.

02:33:37.515 --> 02:33:40.285
MARISHA: If we go through Alfield, we can
check in on our old contact.

02:33:40.285 --> 02:33:42.507
TRAVIS: Are we going to Felderwin village?

02:33:42.507 --> 02:33:43.735
LAURA: Yeah.

02:33:43.736 --> 02:33:47.601
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, it'd be Alfield, really.
Zadash is west of Felderwin.

02:33:47.601 --> 02:33:50.679
LAURA: I think we should go straight
to Felderwin, right?

02:33:50.679 --> 02:33:53.787
TRAVIS: Yeah. Trostenwald by way of Alfield
and then we'll take the Rillway Road?

02:33:53.787 --> 02:33:55.558
SAM: To Alfield?

02:33:55.558 --> 02:33:56.637
TRAVIS: To Felderwin.

02:33:56.637 --> 02:33:57.844
MATT: You can do that.

02:33:57.844 --> 02:33:59.764
TRAVIS: It's a straight shot.

02:33:59.764 --> 02:34:00.853
SAM: Sure.

02:34:00.853 --> 02:34:04.338
MATT: All right. As you complete your
business and have another--

02:34:04.338 --> 02:34:05.922
MARISHA: Bryce!

02:34:05.923 --> 02:34:06.998
MATT: Yes.

02:34:06.998 --> 02:34:08.349
MARISHA: Is Bryce in Alfield?

02:34:08.349 --> 02:34:09.436
MATT: Bryce is in Alfield.

02:34:09.436 --> 02:34:11.054
MARISHA: They're in Alfield, right?

02:34:11.054 --> 02:34:12.109
MATT: Yes, they are.

02:34:12.109 --> 02:34:13.103
SAM: Bryce!

02:34:13.103 --> 02:34:14.194
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:34:14.194 --> 02:34:18.000
MATT: That's okay. You gather your things, the
next morning comes after a day of comparative

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:25.590
relaxation in the city, which has been not too
bad. The next morning comes, the cart has been

02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:32.866
fetched, you have the rest of your things. Your
mother catches you as you're about to head out

02:34:32.866 --> 02:34:39.553
and goes, "Jester, would you like any of your
things from your room before you leave?"

02:34:39.553 --> 02:34:41.718
LAURA: Oh. Well, I mean--

02:34:41.719 --> 02:34:43.676
SAM: The O-Town Posters?

02:34:43.676 --> 02:34:47.184
LAURA: No no no, those can stay. I've moved on.

02:34:47.184 --> 02:34:51.106
(laughter)

02:34:51.106 --> 02:34:56.604
LAURA: Sure. I guess I could use like,
you know, a change of clothes.

02:34:56.604 --> 02:34:59.069
This dress is a little bit messed up now.

02:34:59.069 --> 02:35:02.952
MATT: "All right, no worries." She goes off and
begins packing a few things in a little bag, and

02:35:02.952 --> 02:35:07.929
she comes out with the rest of you. You guys
are getting things in the cart and she steps out

02:35:07.929 --> 02:35:19.184
and there's a little bit of hesitance as she steps
beyond the threshold of the Chateau. Takes a deep

02:35:19.184 --> 02:35:25.021
breath, and then takes a few more steps. Takes
like the 15 feet to the cart and goes, "Here."

02:35:25.022 --> 02:35:27.751
LAURA: (whispers) Mama.

02:35:27.751 --> 02:35:38.018
MATT: "I had something made for you while you
were at sea." She pulls out of a small pouch

02:35:38.018 --> 02:35:44.254
that she has on the side this thin, golden chain
with, about the size of a raisin, a little ruby

02:35:44.255 --> 02:35:51.111
set in with really pretty filigree, and places it
around your neck. "This way, no matter where

02:35:51.111 --> 02:35:55.668
"you are, no matter what's happening,
you always have the Ruby with you."

02:35:55.668 --> 02:36:01.607
LAURA: Oh Mama, thank you so much.
I got you something, too.

02:36:01.607 --> 02:36:03.599
MATT: "What did you get me?"

02:36:03.599 --> 02:36:09.778
LAURA: I get out one of my jars of honey.
It comes from an island in the middle

02:36:09.778 --> 02:36:14.770
of the sea. Very, very sweet;
just like your little sapphire.

02:36:14.770 --> 02:36:20.938
MATT: "Aww. Thank you so much." Pulls you in and
kisses you on the forehead and rubs your cheek.

02:36:20.938 --> 02:36:22.595
"I'm going to miss you."

02:36:22.595 --> 02:36:24.396
LAURA: I miss you already.

02:36:24.397 --> 02:36:25.443
MATT: "Aww."

02:36:25.443 --> 02:36:28.238
LAURA: I'll send you messages
as much as I can, you know.

02:36:28.238 --> 02:36:30.046
MATT: "Please do. Every day, if you can."

02:36:30.046 --> 02:36:31.013
LAURA: Okay.

02:36:31.013 --> 02:36:34.032
MATT: "Take care of her."

02:36:34.032 --> 02:36:35.512
TRAVIS: Of course.

02:36:35.512 --> 02:36:40.625
MATT: "You know not the vengeance I will
bring upon you; and the army of men,

02:36:40.958 --> 02:36:45.088
"and women, and in-between, that
will do what I tell them to."

02:36:45.088 --> 02:36:48.888
MARISHA: Oh, no... Yeah, no. We-- Yeah.

02:36:48.889 --> 02:36:53.021
SAM: Yeah. We love her; almost
as much as you do.

02:36:53.021 --> 02:36:54.763
MATT: "Not possible."

02:36:54.763 --> 02:36:56.978
SAM: Half as much as you do!

02:36:56.978 --> 02:37:01.729
MATT: She puts the honey back in the pouch.
"Be safe, everyone."

02:37:01.729 --> 02:37:06.757
LAURA: Love you, Mama.

02:37:06.757 --> 02:37:08.399
MATT: "I love you too, Jester."

02:37:08.399 --> 02:37:10.173
LAURA: Come on Nugget, let's go!

02:37:10.174 --> 02:37:12.059
MATT: (panting) Jumps into the cart.

02:37:12.059 --> 02:37:14.656
TALIESIN: Oh that's-- No. Yeah,
that's the-- Okay.

02:37:14.657 --> 02:37:21.462
MATT: You feel Sprinkle starting to back up
around your neck.

02:37:21.462 --> 02:37:33.528
LAURA: (whispering) It's okay. I just stare at
Mama, watch the Chateau as we go. Don't take

02:37:33.529 --> 02:37:35.132
my eyes off it.

02:37:35.204 --> 02:37:36.392
SAM: Hyah!

02:37:36.392 --> 02:37:37.784
TALIESIN: Why are you saying hyah?

02:37:37.784 --> 02:37:39.042
SAM: Don't we have horses?

02:37:39.042 --> 02:37:40.447
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've got them right here, but--

02:37:40.447 --> 02:37:42.890
SAM: Hyah!

02:37:42.890 --> 02:37:45.159
MATT: As the cart takes off, making its way to the
northward streets to exit Nicodranas, Marion

02:37:45.159 --> 02:37:51.688
Lavore watches you all leave and gives a quiet
wave as you all disappear into the streets. As she

02:37:51.688 --> 02:37:59.082
disappears around the bend and you turn around in
your seat to look ahead, you can see the open blue

02:37:59.082 --> 02:38:06.779
sky above you, and looking towards the distant
Cyrios Mountains in the path before you, you make

02:38:06.779 --> 02:38:13.567
your way northward. So this is quite a few days
travel. I'll put aside my Nicodranas notes.

02:38:13.567 --> 02:38:16.212
TALIESIN: Roll for initiative.

02:38:16.212 --> 02:38:24.211
MATT: It's about four and a half days to the
Wuyun Gates. For the sake of brevity, because

02:38:24.211 --> 02:38:34.033
we've done this once before. The guards that
are posted at the Wuyun Gates, there's much

02:38:34.033 --> 02:38:40.858
more of a force of security here. As you
approach, there is a back up to the caravan,

02:38:40.858 --> 02:38:44.737
more than you previously experienced exiting.
Each person coming through is having to

02:38:44.737 --> 02:38:52.961
provide paperwork that says where you're
going, who you're going to see-- It's customs,

02:38:52.961 --> 02:38:59.892
essentially. It's getting close to your
passing through; what do you do?

02:38:59.892 --> 02:39:06.042
LAURA: I should forge something really fast.
Who do we know--

02:39:06.042 --> 02:39:09.092
MARISHA: I forgot about this. We've done this
before.

02:39:09.135 --> 02:39:11.408
LIAM: It took four days to get here, we've
done it before, we would have known this

02:39:11.408 --> 02:39:14.832
was going to happen. Not the amount of
security, but that there was security.

02:39:14.832 --> 02:39:18.564
SAM: Didn't we have a way to get back in? No.

02:39:18.564 --> 02:39:33.568
LAURA: From somebody in Zadash? Didn't we?
Shit. What was that guy's name? That,

02:39:33.568 --> 02:39:40.797
after we won the thing and then we were in his--
Where you met the guy!

02:39:40.798 --> 02:39:42.612
LIAM: Super specific so far.

02:39:42.612 --> 02:39:45.259
LAURA: Trent Iki-- Ichi--

02:39:45.259 --> 02:39:46.428
LIAM: Ikithon.

02:39:46.428 --> 02:39:47.753
LAURA: When you met him--

02:39:47.753 --> 02:39:48.938
LIAM: I didn't meet him.

02:39:48.938 --> 02:39:51.503
LAURA: When Yasha met him-- Remember
we were in that party?

02:39:51.503 --> 02:40:00.428
MATT: Okay, so there was Yedaka, who's the guy who
runs the actual event and helms the Victory Pit,

02:40:00.428 --> 02:40:07.434
if that's what you're talking about. If not, then
you're referring to the Starosta of the city.

02:40:07.434 --> 02:40:09.142
LAURA: Starosta!

02:40:09.142 --> 02:40:10.748
SAM: What city is it?

02:40:10.748 --> 02:40:12.420
MATT and LAURA: Zadash.

02:40:12.420 --> 02:40:23.396
MATT: That was... Starosta Wyatt Fedar.

02:40:23.396 --> 02:40:26.376
SAM: We don't have paperwork from him.

02:40:26.376 --> 02:40:28.395
LAURA: Yeah, but I could forge something.

02:40:28.395 --> 02:40:30.748
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:40:30.748 --> 02:40:32.823
MARISHA: The way you did in Zadash?

02:40:32.823 --> 02:40:35.347
LAURA: Yeah, but that's where we're heading to.

02:40:35.347 --> 02:40:36.896
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:40:36.897 --> 02:40:38.983
TRAVIS: Do it.

02:40:38.983 --> 02:40:40.345
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:40:40.345 --> 02:40:43.268
MATT: Do you have any pieces of paperwork
that have his handwriting? Or his signature?

02:40:43.268 --> 02:40:50.062
LAURA: No, but I guess we could say we are
going to Starosta What's-His-Fuck in Al--

02:40:50.062 --> 02:40:52.164
MARISHA: Field?

02:40:52.165 --> 02:40:54.295
MATT: You do have paperwork.

02:40:54.295 --> 02:40:56.358
LAURA: Yeah, I do have his.

02:40:56.358 --> 02:40:58.349
MARISHA: Is that what we were looking for?

02:40:58.349 --> 02:41:00.446
LAURA: Yeah, the smarmy guy.

02:41:00.446 --> 02:41:02.324
SAM: The gnome? Kosh Starosta?

02:41:02.324 --> 02:41:05.022
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Costa... rosta?

02:41:05.022 --> 02:41:06.951
MATT: Kosh was his name.

02:41:06.951 --> 02:41:08.891
SAM: Kosh, Kosh, Starosta Kosh.

02:41:08.891 --> 02:41:12.350
MATT: So would you like to go ahead
and attempt that?

02:41:12.350 --> 02:41:14.312
LAURA: Yeah.

02:41:14.312 --> 02:41:16.102
MATT: All right, what would you want it to say?

02:41:16.103 --> 02:41:19.042
LAURA: That we are heading back--

02:41:19.042 --> 02:41:20.845
MATT: Kosh Clearbarker.

02:41:20.845 --> 02:41:22.429
SAM: Kosh what?

02:41:22.430 --> 02:41:23.991
MATT: Clearbarker.

02:41:23.991 --> 02:41:25.530
SAM: Clearbarker.

02:41:25.530 --> 02:41:32.719
LAURA: That we were in Nicodranas on his
behalf, and that we are heading back

02:41:32.719 --> 02:41:37.865
to Alfield to return with his new... pet.

02:41:37.865 --> 02:41:45.677
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a d20 roll
with your proficiency bonus and your dexterity.

02:41:45.677 --> 02:41:51.548
TALIESIN: Well, it ought to be on a day that--
You should use the mote.

02:41:51.549 --> 02:41:54.115
LAURA: I should use the mote.
Zoom zoom zoom. Okay.

02:41:54.115 --> 02:41:56.675
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make your roll.

02:41:56.675 --> 02:42:03.165
LAURA: Add proficiency and dexterity?

02:42:03.165 --> 02:42:04.873
MATT: Correct.

02:42:04.873 --> 02:42:10.759
LAURA: Okay, that would be 20 plus proficiency--
23.

02:42:10.859 --> 02:42:16.095
MATT: You feel pretty confident about your
piece of paperwork you presented. The DC was

02:42:16.095 --> 02:42:21.332
definitively lowered because it was something
that you had existing paperwork as an example

02:42:21.333 --> 02:42:26.277
of handwriting on, so upon passing through, you
present your paperwork and the guard there gives

02:42:26.277 --> 02:42:34.223
you a look. "All right. You are returning to
Alfield, what is your business in Nicodranas?"

02:42:34.223 --> 02:42:41.663
LAURA: Yes, we were getting his new pet. They're
very rare apparently, or something, hmm.

02:42:41.663 --> 02:42:46.469
MATT: "Okay, and you are returning to the
Empire? You're not staying in the Empire."

02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:49.500
LAURA: We are returning to the Empire.

02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:51.218
MATT: "All right, and whom do you pray to?"

02:42:51.219 --> 02:43:00.613
LAURA: To... To the old platinum dragon
of course! Just like everybody else!

02:43:00.613 --> 02:43:02.197
MATT: (laughing) Make a deception check.

02:43:02.636 --> 02:43:05.900
(laughter)

02:43:05.900 --> 02:43:10.206
LAURA: Shit. That's cocked! Balls, I wanted to
take the 17 that was barely there. Deception?

02:43:10.206 --> 02:43:11.771
MATT: Yeah.

02:43:11.771 --> 02:43:13.076
LAURA: Nine?

02:43:13.076 --> 02:43:14.312
MARISHA: Nine!

02:43:14.312 --> 02:43:21.423
LAURA: Nein! That old platinum dragon. Ooh.
Sure do love that guy.

02:43:21.423 --> 02:43:25.502
(laughter)

02:43:25.502 --> 02:43:29.384
MATT: "Hold here for a second." And makes
a whistle and some the other guards

02:43:29.384 --> 02:43:31.734
begin to circle and they're going to do
a full inspection on the cart.

02:43:31.734 --> 02:43:33.306
SAM: Aww, do we have anything?

02:43:33.306 --> 02:43:34.449
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:43:34.449 --> 02:43:35.297
TALIESIN: No.

02:43:35.297 --> 02:43:36.640
MARISHA: Do we have anything bad?

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:38.154
LAURA: No, we just have Nugget.

02:43:38.155 --> 02:43:40.310
SAM: Wait, is this our invisible cart or
did we ditch that?

02:43:40.310 --> 02:43:42.046
TRAVIS: I think this is just a regular cart.

02:43:42.072 --> 02:43:44.121
SAM: The cart with invisible shit on it?

02:43:44.121 --> 02:43:47.786
TALIESIN: This is the invisible cart, but
we told them how it worked last time.

02:43:47.946 --> 02:43:50.075
And we'll do the same thing this time.

02:43:50.075 --> 02:43:53.821
MATT: They just look through it and go, and
he reaches in to go and rummage through

02:43:53.821 --> 02:44:00.039
and passes through the illusion.
And you explain how it works?

02:44:00.039 --> 02:44:05.981
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. It's to ward off bandits,
makes it a little easier to-- Feel free though,

02:44:05.981 --> 02:44:08.324
it's just an illusion on the cart.

02:44:08.324 --> 02:44:15.450
MATT: "Let them through." They go ahead and wave
you though. The high-rolling paperwork helped you.

02:44:15.450 --> 02:44:17.259
LAURA: Ooh!

02:44:17.259 --> 02:44:24.663
MATT: All right. Now, the open blue skies
of the coast give to the winter gray of the

02:44:24.663 --> 02:44:28.707
Marrow Valley. You have four days to
Trostenwald. Is there anything you

02:44:28.707 --> 02:44:31.842
wish to do in that four day period, or no?

02:44:31.842 --> 02:44:35.675
LAURA: I'm going to try to teach Nugget.
You know, just work on that whole

02:44:35.675 --> 02:44:39.027
bamfing in and out and staying with us.

02:44:39.027 --> 02:44:41.185
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

02:44:41.185 --> 02:44:47.912
LAURA: Okay. 12?

02:44:47.912 --> 02:44:54.597
MATT: Nugget hasn't spent some time with you.
And occasionally will listen to you, but mostly

02:44:54.597 --> 02:44:58.265
just seems excited that things are around and he
gets to go out. You get the sense that the entire

02:44:58.265 --> 02:45:04.346
time you were gone he was cooped up in your old
room and is just like (excited panting) looking at

02:45:04.346 --> 02:45:07.823
everything around and occasionally leaps out of
the cart after something and chases it down

02:45:07.823 --> 02:45:10.115
and then just bamfs back.

02:45:10.115 --> 02:45:11.940
LAURA: Okay, at least there's that.

02:45:11.941 --> 02:45:15.624
MATT: It's like a tether teleport. You
make your way to Trostenwald?

02:45:15.624 --> 02:45:20.913
LIAM: I walk over while she's training the
dog. He's getting very good at that.

02:45:20.913 --> 02:45:23.913
You're doing a good job.

02:45:23.913 --> 02:45:25.471
LAURA: Thanks, Caleb.

02:45:25.471 --> 02:45:29.814
LIAM: I really don't like dogs, I'm sorry.
I finished this book; I thought

02:45:29.815 --> 02:45:32.436
you might like it. It's about romance
at sea with a sailor.

02:45:32.436 --> 02:45:35.592
LAURA: What is it called?

02:45:35.592 --> 02:45:41.493
LIAM: Did I get a name for it? If I did,
Liam does not remember it.

02:45:41.493 --> 02:45:45.642
MATT: I don't think you got a name for it, you
just got a description of what it contained.

02:45:45.642 --> 02:45:47.572
LAURA: What is the name of it?

02:45:47.572 --> 02:45:49.204
MATT: The Salty Sea.

02:45:49.204 --> 02:45:51.690
LAURA: The Salty Sea! Oh, wait. I feel like I--

02:45:51.691 --> 02:45:54.971
LIAM: I was going to say The Salty Sea Nuts, but
I was like, I'm not going to say &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; out loud.

02:45:54.971 --> 02:45:57.860
(laughter)

02:45:58.077 --> 02:46:02.250
LAURA: The Salty Sea, huh? Heyo.

02:46:02.250 --> 02:46:03.815
LIAM: That's it. Enjoy.

02:46:03.815 --> 02:46:09.080
SAM: I'm going to try to refine that oil
that I bought into more... burn-y oil?

02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:12.763
Is that something I can do on a moving cart?

02:46:12.763 --> 02:46:14.955
MATT: Do you have your alchemical supplies
with you?

02:46:14.955 --> 02:46:17.779
SAM: I mean I have, it says alchemist supplies.

02:46:17.779 --> 02:46:24.829
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make-- This will
be proficiency plus intelligence modifier;

02:46:24.829 --> 02:46:28.622
make it with disadvantage because
you're on a moving cart.

02:46:28.622 --> 02:46:35.596
SAM: Sure, sure. They were both the same.
Intelligence modifier?

02:46:35.596 --> 02:46:37.423
MATT: Yep.

02:46:37.424 --> 02:46:39.056
SAM: 16.

02:46:39.056 --> 02:46:44.393
MATT: Okay. I'd say if you focus on it
entirely from your trip between Nicodranas

02:46:44.393 --> 02:46:48.050
and Trostenwald, you could probably
prepare half of that amount.

02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:49.810
SAM: Okay.

02:46:49.810 --> 02:46:56.346
MATT: So as far as the vials of oil, what would
be considered a singular vial, the whole

02:46:56.346 --> 02:47:01.141
amount that you purchased could make four,
you have two completed that can be used.

02:47:01.141 --> 02:47:03.936
They're prepared as Alchemist Oil.

02:47:03.936 --> 02:47:04.910
SAM: Great!

02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:08.572
MATT: All right, you guys make your way
to Trostenwald?

02:47:08.572 --> 02:47:12.024
MARISHA: And one of these nights,
I talk to Jester.

02:47:12.024 --> 02:47:14.669
MATT: This is perfect. As we're moving along if
at any point you want to interject just jump in.

02:47:14.669 --> 02:47:22.561
MARISHA: You have that spell that you can talk to
people? Send them messages very far away?

02:47:22.561 --> 02:47:24.140
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:25.664
MARISHA: How far away?

02:47:25.665 --> 02:47:26.562
LAURA: Anywhere.

02:47:26.562 --> 02:47:27.649
MARISHA: That's awesome.

02:47:27.649 --> 02:47:28.671
LAURA: As long as you know they're on this plane.

02:47:28.947 --> 02:47:34.983
MARISHA: I do. Could you do one of those for me?
To somebody? Is that a thing you can do?

02:47:34.983 --> 02:47:40.073
LAURA: Yeah, maybe I can try. It's usually
somebody that I know of, so if you

02:47:40.073 --> 02:47:42.370
describe them pretty well, maybe I can?

02:47:42.370 --> 02:47:45.802
MARISHA: Her name is Dairon.

02:47:45.802 --> 02:47:49.846
LAURA: Dairon, okay.

02:47:49.846 --> 02:47:54.444
MARISHA: She was a... roommate
at the Cobalt Soul.

02:47:54.444 --> 02:47:57.680
LAURA: Okay, extra-special roommate.

02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:02.210
MARISHA: She taught me a lot of
really great things.

02:48:02.210 --> 02:48:04.033
LAURA: Okay.

02:48:04.033 --> 02:48:08.125
MARISHA: I just want to make sure she's
okay because she got sent to the war

02:48:08.125 --> 02:48:11.570
front on the Xhorhasian Coast.

02:48:11.570 --> 02:48:12.998
LAURA: Oh, no!

02:48:12.998 --> 02:48:16.533
MARISHA: Yeah. I think she's fine. She was
just there to check it out.

02:48:16.533 --> 02:48:18.283
LAURA: When did she get sent away?

02:48:18.283 --> 02:48:25.221
MARISHA: When we were still in Zadash. Last time
that I was there, I talked to her and she was

02:48:25.221 --> 02:48:31.887
leaving, and then went back and she hadn't
come back yet, so it's been a few months.

02:48:31.888 --> 02:48:34.349
LAURA: What does she look like? It helps me.

02:48:34.349 --> 02:48:43.488
MARISHA: She's got a shaved head, and she
wears dark-colored clothes.

02:48:43.488 --> 02:48:45.673
LAURA: Okay, dark clothes...

02:48:45.674 --> 02:48:51.202
MARISHA: She's got super buff muscles--

02:48:51.301 --> 02:48:53.399
LAURA: Super buff, got it.

02:48:53.399 --> 02:48:56.197
MARISHA: 'Cause she's been working out.

02:48:56.197 --> 02:48:58.096
LAURA: Do you love her?

02:48:58.096 --> 02:49:02.146
MARISHA: You know, I-- We've had good times.

02:49:02.147 --> 02:49:04.694
LAURA: Good times. Good times, okay.

02:49:04.694 --> 02:49:15.204
MARISHA: I think that's just the thing.
I have notes somewhere in here.

02:49:15.266 --> 02:49:22.545
LAURA: You can keep-- in my head, just keep saying
those things as I'm like: Think about her, picture her.

02:49:22.545 --> 02:49:27.603
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm meditating on Dairon
and as I meditate, I--

02:49:27.698 --> 02:49:29.478
LAURA: What do you want me to say?

02:49:29.478 --> 02:49:32.926
MARISHA: Hey, girl--

02:49:32.926 --> 02:49:34.776
LAURA: Hey, girl.

02:49:34.776 --> 02:49:36.966
MARISHA: Heading to Felderwin.

02:49:36.966 --> 02:49:39.339
LAURA: Heading to Felderwin. This is Beau.

02:49:39.339 --> 02:49:42.061
MARISHA: This is Beau. Might be
heading to Zadash after that.

02:49:42.061 --> 02:49:44.114
LAURA: Maybe heading to Zadash after that.

02:49:44.114 --> 02:49:47.983
MARISHA: You know, if you're in the area,
hit me up.

02:49:47.983 --> 02:49:50.438
LAURA: You know, if you're in the area,
hit me up.

02:49:50.438 --> 02:49:51.851
MARISHA: Booty call.

02:49:51.851 --> 02:49:53.200
LAURA: Booty call?

02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:54.755
TRAVIS: How many words? That's 22.

02:49:54.755 --> 02:49:56.883
SAM: Three more. I think it's 25 words.

02:49:56.883 --> 02:49:58.271
MARISHA: Call me back.

02:49:58.271 --> 02:49:59.904
LAURA: Call me back!

02:49:59.904 --> 02:50:01.831
SAM: Has no means to call you back.

02:50:01.831 --> 02:50:03.336
MARISHA: Nope.

02:50:03.336 --> 02:50:05.517
LAURA: Yeah, she can't call you back.
I should have told you that.

02:50:05.517 --> 02:50:07.262
MARISHA: Oh, right, but she kn-- yeah.

02:50:07.263 --> 02:50:09.056
MATT: Wait, is this Sending?

02:50:09.056 --> 02:50:10.253
LAURA: Yeah.

02:50:10.253 --> 02:50:12.117
MATT: Sending, they can respond to you.

02:50:12.117 --> 02:50:13.462
LAURA: Oh, sweet. Really?

02:50:13.462 --> 02:50:14.965
MATT: Yeah. That's how it's done in the past.

02:50:14.965 --> 02:50:17.088
LAURA: Sending, they can respond to me,
that's right! I totally forgot!

02:50:17.088 --> 02:50:21.202
MARISHA: Ooh! She'll be gone for the next month
to the Bladegarden to help with the assault!

02:50:21.202 --> 02:50:23.091
LAURA: She's in Bladegarden, got it.

02:50:23.092 --> 02:50:25.357
MARISHA: She's in Bladegarden. Narrow it down.

02:50:25.357 --> 02:50:26.998
LAURA: Got it, Bladegarden.

02:50:26.998 --> 02:50:29.281
MARISHA: I told her that, though, before
she sent it, that she was in Bladegarden,

02:50:29.282 --> 02:50:30.985
because I would have known that.

02:50:30.985 --> 02:50:32.629
LAURA: Waiting for the call back.

02:50:32.629 --> 02:50:34.655
MATT: I will say, roll an intelligence check, Beau.

02:50:34.655 --> 02:50:40.781
MARISHA: Just straight intelligence?

02:50:40.781 --> 02:50:41.551
MATT: Yep.

02:50:41.551 --> 02:50:46.305
MARISHA: Lucky jade. Okay, okay, okay.
17, natural 15.

02:50:46.412 --> 02:50:50.639
MATT: Okay, yeah. You are particularly
descriptive in your ability to recall

02:50:50.639 --> 02:50:54.772
details about Dairon, because you are not
familiar with this individual.

02:50:54.772 --> 02:50:59.364
MARISHA: She's got a longer nose, pointed--

02:50:59.364 --> 02:51:00.968
MATT: Yeah, you give a very specific
detail about them.

02:51:00.969 --> 02:51:03.225
MARISHA: Fierce eyebrows.

02:51:03.225 --> 02:51:05.038
MATT: I'll allow it.

02:51:05.038 --> 02:51:06.793
MARISHA: Thanks, Dungeon Master.

02:51:06.793 --> 02:51:11.870
LAURA: Just waiting for a, "Hey," back.

02:51:11.871 --> 02:51:18.801
TALIESIN: On a fast one, I want to take a moment
on the first night, also, to let Fjord know.

02:51:18.801 --> 02:51:24.480
I just want to let you know that, while we're
on the sea, I had a talk with my goddess

02:51:24.866 --> 02:51:28.786
and that friend of yours is still out there.

02:51:28.786 --> 02:51:30.900
TRAVIS: Friend of mine?

02:51:30.900 --> 02:51:35.169
TALIESIN: Yeah, that old friend of yours that
you haven't seen in a while. What's his name?

02:51:35.169 --> 02:51:37.304
TRAVIS: Vandran?

02:51:37.304 --> 02:51:39.272
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the one.

02:51:39.273 --> 02:51:41.316
TRAVIS: How do you know that?

02:51:41.316 --> 02:51:44.798
TALIESIN: I asked the Wildmother.

02:51:44.798 --> 02:51:54.955
TRAVIS: Is this the same as Jester talking to the
Traveler? You hear from the Wildmother?

02:51:54.955 --> 02:51:59.892
TALIESIN: I feel like I would be speaking to
things I didn't necessarily know about. I don't

02:51:59.892 --> 02:52:05.513
entirely know the Traveler, nor entirely understand
what the Traveler is, but I know the Wildmother.

02:52:05.514 --> 02:52:09.884
TRAVIS: You asked about him for me?

02:52:09.884 --> 02:52:16.133
TALIESIN: Yeah. "Making amends,"
whatever that means.

02:52:16.133 --> 02:52:18.918
TRAVIS: He was making amends?

02:52:18.918 --> 02:52:20.961
TALIESIN: One way or another.

02:52:20.961 --> 02:52:23.669
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:52:23.669 --> 02:52:34.292
TALIESIN: It's a very particular flavor of
goodness that come from those who are

02:52:34.292 --> 02:52:43.413
offered so much temptation. I have some
faith in you. Back to the horses.

02:52:43.414 --> 02:52:45.999
LIAM: I got one, too.

02:52:45.999 --> 02:52:49.865
MATT: All right, hold on. Let me finish up here
while this conversation's happening. You hear a

02:52:49.865 --> 02:53:08.253
response: (strained) "I do not recognize this
voice, but I'm familiar with this magic. I am

02:53:08.253 --> 02:53:16.780
"recovering in Bladegarden, but am safe."
That's all.

02:53:16.780 --> 02:53:18.877
LAURA: She hit me up!

02:53:18.877 --> 02:53:20.772
MARISHA: What? Really-- I mean--

02:53:20.772 --> 02:53:24.061
LAURA: Not me, not, "She was hitting me up,"-- you
up, through me.

02:53:24.061 --> 02:53:25.828
MARISHA: Sure!

02:53:25.828 --> 02:53:27.333
LAURA: She's in Bladegarden.

02:53:27.334 --> 02:53:29.101
MARISHA: What?

02:53:29.101 --> 02:53:32.514
LAURA: She's recovering. She was hurt or something.
She sounded either sleepy or injured or something.

02:53:32.514 --> 02:53:34.042
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

02:53:34.042 --> 02:53:36.350
LAURA: But she's safe now. So Bladegarden.

02:53:36.350 --> 02:53:37.910
MARISHA: Okay.

02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:39.842
LAURA: She sounded way into you.

02:53:39.842 --> 02:53:40.928
MARISHA: Really?

02:53:40.928 --> 02:53:42.444
LAURA: Yeah, like super-duper.

02:53:42.444 --> 02:53:49.027
MARISHA: Thanks, Jester. That's a big deal. Okay.

02:53:49.027 --> 02:53:50.949
MATT: Caleb?

02:53:50.949 --> 02:53:54.521
LIAM: On a different night-- I assume
we're camping every night, &lt;i&gt;ja&lt;/i&gt;?

02:53:54.521 --> 02:53:55.880
MATT: Yeah.

02:53:55.880 --> 02:53:58.496
TRAVIS: Off the path.

02:53:58.496 --> 02:54:05.511
MATT: As you get to a higher level and travel
further distances, it's less and less fun to make

02:54:05.511 --> 02:54:10.364
you roll survival every night you camp.
The general roadside issues that would

02:54:10.364 --> 02:54:13.184
come your way are less of a challenge.

02:54:13.184 --> 02:54:14.900
LIAM: Just for setting.

02:54:14.900 --> 02:54:16.399
MATT: Yeah.

02:54:16.399 --> 02:54:18.983
LIAM: May I borrow you for a word?

02:54:18.984 --> 02:54:20.553
MARISHA: What? Me?

02:54:20.553 --> 02:54:22.631
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:54:22.631 --> 02:54:24.535
MARISHA: Yeah. 'Sup?

02:54:24.535 --> 02:54:38.713
LIAM: I was very brusque, back in Nicodranas,
with you. (sighs) I'm sorry.

02:54:38.713 --> 02:54:52.795
I felt very exposed with that man. Um--

02:54:52.795 --> 02:54:54.964
MARISHA: What was that?

02:54:54.964 --> 02:54:59.093
LIAM: I was just collecting my thoughts.

02:54:59.093 --> 02:55:00.510
MARISHA: Okay.

02:55:00.510 --> 02:55:13.986
LIAM: With a man like Yussa, if he wanted to find
us-- maybe not me, but the rest of you-- he will,

02:55:13.986 --> 02:55:22.373
and I do not know his allegiances or his motives
or anything. Neither did you, none of us did.

02:55:22.373 --> 02:55:33.446
There are people who would flay me like a cat
if they could get their hands on me, so--

02:55:33.446 --> 02:55:41.346
MARISHA: Did he say something to you about your
past when you were in there with him?

02:55:41.346 --> 02:55:44.527
LIAM: No, but he was hard to read.

02:55:44.527 --> 02:55:47.531
MARISHA: You think he saw into you?

02:55:47.532 --> 02:55:52.529
LIAM: (sighs) I don't know, Beauregard.

02:55:52.529 --> 02:55:54.035
MARISHA: You're a man of--

02:55:54.035 --> 02:56:01.351
LIAM: But I don't like to not know. I like
traveling with you people and I don't want to take

02:56:01.352 --> 02:56:08.092
unnecessary risks, so, I'm not telling you what to
do-- I could not tell you what to do-- but if--

02:56:08.092 --> 02:56:19.463
for me to stay with you all, I can't keep poking
my head up like a mole from a hole in the ground

02:56:19.463 --> 02:56:27.610
because someone is going to cave my skull in if I
do it in the wrong place, and if you all are with

02:56:27.610 --> 02:56:41.532
me, you will die with me. That man in Rexxentrum,
he would spread my guts out onto the stone floor

02:56:41.532 --> 02:56:47.440
if he could get his hands on me now, if he knew
where I was, so I factor that into all of my

02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:53.064
thinking everywhere we go. Everywhere I have been
for five years, I have been looking over my

02:56:53.064 --> 02:57:08.482
shoulder, so it's not really fair to all of you
because we are linked like this now. He is

02:57:08.482 --> 02:57:13.508
arguably the most powerful man in the Empire.

02:57:13.508 --> 02:57:18.101
MARISHA: The man in Rexxentrum or Yussa?

02:57:18.102 --> 02:57:34.373
LIAM: Ikithon. I just wanted you to understand me
better. As much as I am able to have friends,

02:57:34.373 --> 02:57:42.841
I like you, all right? I don't people very well,
I am well aware. It's been a long time since I had

02:57:42.842 --> 02:57:51.863
a lot of practice, but I have to be careful, and
if we can't be careful enough, I have to go.

02:57:51.863 --> 02:58:04.720
MARISHA: Do you have to go, or do you want to
go? Because what I'm hearing from you, Caleb,

02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:10.555
is that you don't understand that you have
friends. We're here, willing to defend you

02:58:10.556 --> 02:58:13.208
and kick some ass just like we did for Fjord--

02:58:13.208 --> 02:58:15.185
LIAM: That is beside the point!

02:58:15.185 --> 02:58:16.623
MARISHA: Is it, though?

02:58:16.623 --> 02:58:25.696
LIAM: Yes, it is very much beside the point!
Because if I care for any of you at all, and that

02:58:25.696 --> 02:58:33.367
man in the northern end of this Empire knows where
any one of you are, he knows he can get to me.

02:58:33.367 --> 02:58:41.609
If he finds us, you all will just be thrown
into the fire with me.

02:58:41.609 --> 02:58:48.633
MARISHA: Caleb, unfortunately, you don't
get to choose who cares for you.

02:58:48.633 --> 02:58:57.238
It's not a choice you get to make. You can
either accept this--

02:58:57.238 --> 02:59:02.472
LIAM: We're talking around each other. That is not
the point that I am arguing; I am saying that

02:59:02.472 --> 02:59:09.388
if we are going to stay together we have
to be careful. Careful.

02:59:09.389 --> 02:59:14.458
MARISHA: What do you want? We can't find anything
out if we don't talk to people, if we're not

02:59:14.458 --> 02:59:20.799
careful. I don't like not knowing either, Caleb.
It's why I thought I would talk to people.

02:59:20.799 --> 02:59:24.873
LIAM: Just persons like that one in that tower.

02:59:24.873 --> 02:59:34.574
MARISHA: I thought you'd be excited. I thought
I did a damn good job in there. I thought

02:59:34.575 --> 02:59:41.131
me and Caduceus both did. I was talking to
Nott and we thought for damn sure that

02:59:41.131 --> 02:59:44.216
you would be so stoked about this goddamn
fucking tower.

02:59:44.217 --> 02:59:56.386
LIAM: You know, in the abstract, I am,
but the problem with friends is that

02:59:56.386 --> 03:00:00.464
you have to care about them.
And I wander away.

03:00:00.464 --> 03:00:07.339
MARISHA: Wow! (shouting) Wow!
Fucking cool, Caleb!

03:00:07.339 --> 03:00:12.904
LAURA: Caleb is really cool!

03:00:12.904 --> 03:00:17.595
MARISHA: Yeah, he's cool. (shouting)
You're cool, Caleb! See, Jester thinks

03:00:17.595 --> 03:00:20.617
you're fucking cool! Because she's
your fucking friend!

03:00:20.617 --> 03:00:22.918
TRAVIS: I'm trying to sleep. What are
y'all doing?

03:00:22.918 --> 03:00:24.814
MARISHA: (even louder) Sorry, Fjord!

03:00:24.814 --> 03:00:26.940
TRAVIS: Aw, fuck.

03:00:26.940 --> 03:00:29.032
TALIESIN: What? Oh god.

03:00:29.032 --> 03:00:32.901
MATT: All right. Do you have any business
in Trostenwald while you're there?

03:00:32.901 --> 03:00:38.827
LIAM: Well, I'm going to go stand in front
of a tree for 20 seconds and do this.

03:00:38.827 --> 03:00:41.679
(laughter)

03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:43.185
MATT: Perfect.

03:00:43.185 --> 03:00:45.884
TALIESIN: This is everything I liked about
both those characters happening all at once.

03:00:45.884 --> 03:00:49.022
It was amazing, just amazing.

03:00:49.022 --> 03:00:56.793
MATT: Two incongruent conversationalists,
I love it. All right, cool.

03:00:56.793 --> 03:00:58.661
SAM: Gustav's out of jail, right?

03:00:58.661 --> 03:00:59.993
LAURA: Yeah.

03:00:59.993 --> 03:01:03.085
SAM: Cool, we're done there.
Nothing in Trostenwald.

03:01:03.085 --> 03:01:05.181
MATT: You get some more supplies for the
next leg of your journey, if you'd like to.

03:01:05.181 --> 03:01:14.883
To get you to Alfield, we'll say, amongst
the whole crew, maybe-- let's see here...

03:01:15.007 --> 03:01:17.906
LAURA: We still can create food and water.

03:01:17.907 --> 03:01:20.391
MATT: If you want to create food and water,
then you don't have to pay for anything.

03:01:20.391 --> 03:01:25.587
All right, cool. You travel--
this would be two days.

03:01:25.587 --> 03:01:28.813
TALIESIN: Is Gustav still in the town, or has
he left town? Just out of idle curiosity.

03:01:28.813 --> 03:01:30.929
MATT: You want to ask around?

03:01:30.929 --> 03:01:32.654
TALIESIN: Just while we're there.

03:01:32.654 --> 03:01:34.716
MATT: Okay, while you're there, go ahead
and make an investigation check.

03:01:34.716 --> 03:01:38.428
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 14.

03:01:38.428 --> 03:01:41.794
MATT: Asking around? No sign of Gustav.

03:01:41.794 --> 03:01:43.224
TALIESIN: That'll do.

03:01:43.224 --> 03:01:52.278
MATT: The few people that knew of him, only
because of the conversation and local talk about

03:01:52.278 --> 03:01:54.918
(old person's voice) that terrible circus
that came through town,

03:01:54.918 --> 03:01:57.765
that carnival that killed all them people.

03:01:57.765 --> 03:01:59.672
TALIESIN: Greatest show on Earth.

03:01:59.673 --> 03:02:03.152
MATT: Gustav fucked off as soon as
he was let out.

03:02:03.152 --> 03:02:04.707
TALIESIN: Cool.

03:02:04.707 --> 03:02:08.442
SAM: We're going to Alfield, or are we
bypassing Alfield?

03:02:08.442 --> 03:02:11.223
MATT: You're going to Alfield and then
bypassing Zadash, is what you were saying,

03:02:11.223 --> 03:02:13.223
and then going straight to Felderwin.

03:02:13.223 --> 03:02:14.963
TRAVIS: Veering right.

03:02:14.963 --> 03:02:20.894
MATT: You make your way, two days, to Felderwin--
I'm sorry, to Alfield. Any business in Alfield?

03:02:20.894 --> 03:02:23.051
SAM: Are we checking in with Bryce?

03:02:23.051 --> 03:02:23.819
MARISHA: Yeah, do we--?

03:02:23.819 --> 03:02:26.777
LAURA: Yeah, sure. Just say what's up.

03:02:26.777 --> 03:02:33.574
MATT: Okay. As you approach the city, the people
here go about their business per normal, though it

03:02:33.574 --> 03:02:41.493
does look like there is a presence of Righteous
Brand soldiers, maybe a hundred or so that have

03:02:41.493 --> 03:02:46.055
been stationed here on top of the crownsguard. The
crownsguard were here before, and you see

03:02:46.055 --> 03:02:51.894
Righteous Brand patrolling the major ins and outs
and doing passes around the vicinity. General

03:02:51.894 --> 03:03:01.391
protection to this city has been increased in the
presence of this war. You approach the city and

03:03:01.391 --> 03:03:07.511
ask around. Bryce is both available, though
looking a bit harried. They approach.

03:03:07.511 --> 03:03:14.545
"My goodness, it's been some time, friends!
You look traveled."

03:03:14.545 --> 03:03:16.538
MARISHA: Thanks!

03:03:16.538 --> 03:03:18.591
MATT: "What can I do to help you?"

03:03:18.591 --> 03:03:22.746
LAURA: Well, mostly, we're just wondering if you
have any information about what's been going on.

03:03:22.746 --> 03:03:29.662
MATT: "Well, best that we can-- best that I know,
at least-- we're just being as careful as

03:03:29.662 --> 03:03:35.381
"possible. We didn't expect things to press this
far east this quickly. From what I know is

03:03:35.381 --> 03:03:42.518
"Felderwin just recently took an assault from the
brief missives that have been sent around to

03:03:42.518 --> 03:03:48.434
"various lawmasters in the vicinity.
The attacks came from underground."

03:03:48.434 --> 03:03:51.027
TRAVIS: Underground?

03:03:51.027 --> 03:03:52.508
SAM: What?

03:03:52.508 --> 03:04:00.060
MATT: "It wasn't a direct assault. Apparently--
and this put us in a bit of a tizzy recently--

03:04:00.060 --> 03:04:05.726
"they managed to just appear
in the city from underneath."

03:04:05.727 --> 03:04:09.320
TRAVIS: Were they able to repel these attacks?

03:04:09.320 --> 03:04:15.709
MATT: "They burned some of the fields and
destroyed a few buildings and then left.

03:04:15.710 --> 03:04:20.992
"I don't know the exact number of dead;
you'd probably have to ask."

03:04:20.992 --> 03:04:24.227
LAURA: Are you worried? It's pretty
close to here!

03:04:24.227 --> 03:04:29.135
MATT: "I'm a bit worried, yes. We're all a bit
worried. We don't want to alarm the populace, but

03:04:29.135 --> 03:04:33.944
"(sighs) rumors spread and we do our best
to quell them."

03:04:33.944 --> 03:04:36.206
LAURA: What's your sewer system like here?

03:04:36.206 --> 03:04:42.846
MATT: "It's more of a-- we don't have any of the
fancy subterranean sewers as cities like Zadash

03:04:42.846 --> 03:04:49.119
"to the north. It's mostly a dig-a-hole,
outhouse-type scenario."

03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:52.084
SAM: That might actually be safer.

03:04:52.084 --> 03:05:00.418
MATT: "Good. We're just hoping that there isn't
much of a reason to stop in Alfield. At least we

03:05:00.418 --> 03:05:08.116
"know that Felderwin supplies most of the Empire
with its food and crops and such, so there seems

03:05:08.116 --> 03:05:13.579
"to be some strategic reason for that assault,
though I don't see what purpose Alfield has in the

03:05:13.579 --> 03:05:16.431
"larger spectrum, so I'm banking on that."

03:05:16.432 --> 03:05:18.512
LAURA: Cool.

03:05:18.512 --> 03:05:20.299
MATT: "Where are you off to?"

03:05:20.299 --> 03:05:21.963
TRAVIS: Felderwin.

03:05:21.963 --> 03:05:26.646
MATT: "Well, good news is they've already been
attacked. Hopefully the lightning doesn't strike twice."

03:05:26.647 --> 03:05:29.628
TRAVIS: Indeed.

03:05:29.628 --> 03:05:34.304
TALIESIN: They stole whatever it was
they were trying to steal, I guess.

03:05:34.304 --> 03:05:36.033
MARISHA: That's exactly what I think.

03:05:36.033 --> 03:05:37.777
TALIESIN: Hi, by the way.

03:05:37.777 --> 03:05:40.712
MATT: "Hi, yes, we met briefly when you
passed through here earlier."

03:05:40.712 --> 03:05:42.493
TALIESIN: Good to see you again.

03:05:42.494 --> 03:05:44.224
MATT: "Pleasure to see you again as well."

03:05:44.224 --> 03:05:49.186
TRAVIS: We should be on our way.

03:05:49.186 --> 03:05:52.093
SAM: Say hi to everyone for us.

03:05:52.094 --> 03:05:54.860
TRAVIS: A bit quicker than we thought,
I'm afraid.

03:05:54.860 --> 03:05:59.389
MATT: "That's all right. If there's anything that
I can do to aid you if you need to pass through

03:05:59.389 --> 03:06:01.875
"again, just let me know. You know
where to find me."

03:06:01.875 --> 03:06:03.534
TRAVIS: Good to see you.

03:06:03.534 --> 03:06:05.768
MATT: "Good to see you as well. Travel safe."

03:06:05.768 --> 03:06:13.209
TALIESIN: Actually, would a letter of good note
get us any further in case we run into anybody?

03:06:13.210 --> 03:06:16.787
SAM: Maybe not from Bryce. I mean, I like Bryce.

03:06:16.787 --> 03:06:19.198
TALIESIN: I don't know.

03:06:19.198 --> 03:06:22.087
SAM: Bryce is cool.

03:06:22.087 --> 03:06:27.797
MATT: "There's not much I can really help with.
I'm not really involved in the red tape of most

03:06:27.798 --> 03:06:30.935
"things. If it's another lawmaster you're going
to speak with, that's one thing, but--"

03:06:30.935 --> 03:06:33.693
TALIESIN: It's worth asking, I suppose.

03:06:33.693 --> 03:06:38.685
MARISHA: You wouldn't happen to have any
handwriting samples of some lawmasters?

03:06:38.685 --> 03:06:42.162
SAM: We have the handwriting samples.

03:06:42.163 --> 03:06:46.927
MARISHA: I know! But for more, other ones.
Other than, you know.

03:06:46.927 --> 03:06:51.687
SAM: Happen to have any forgeable paperwork
of other cities' lawmasters?

03:06:51.687 --> 03:06:54.297
TRAVIS: Do you have any deposited checks
or bank statements?

03:06:54.297 --> 03:06:55.896
MARISHA: Stolen mail?

03:06:55.896 --> 03:06:58.067
MATT: "No, I don't."

03:06:58.067 --> 03:06:59.786
MARISHA: Sign-in sheets, even?

03:06:59.786 --> 03:07:03.338
SAM: Good! Because that would be illegal
and you're a person of the law.

03:07:03.338 --> 03:07:06.003
MATT: "I am indeed, and that would be illegal."

03:07:06.004 --> 03:07:08.898
MARISHA: Great. We don't have to arrest you.

03:07:08.898 --> 03:07:10.433
LIAM: You passed.

03:07:10.433 --> 03:07:11.699
MARISHA: Yep.

03:07:11.699 --> 03:07:13.400
SAM: It was a trick!

03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:17.450
TRAVIS: Well done. Virtuous indeed.

03:07:17.451 --> 03:07:18.655
MARISHA: Yep.

03:07:18.655 --> 03:07:22.312
MATT: "Wonderful, thank you for the opportunity
to prove my virtue."

03:07:22.312 --> 03:07:25.661
TRAVIS: Thank you, Bryce. Thank you.

03:07:25.661 --> 03:07:28.414
LAURA: I'm sorry we're so weird sometimes,
you know?

03:07:28.414 --> 03:07:31.703
MATT: "To be honest, weirder come through
here fairly often, especially these days."

03:07:31.757 --> 03:07:34.562
LIAM: We have grown since the last time
we rolled through this town.

03:07:34.562 --> 03:07:36.432
LAURA: Grown weirder.

03:07:36.433 --> 03:07:41.823
MATT: "Yeah. The direction you've grown is
curious, but in all sincerity, it's good to see

03:07:41.823 --> 03:07:45.185
"you all. All right, be safe."

03:07:45.185 --> 03:07:46.984
LAURA and TALIESIN: Be safe.

03:07:46.984 --> 03:07:48.234
LAURA: Jinx.

03:07:48.234 --> 03:07:51.448
MATT: "Jinx indeed. All right, back to business."

03:07:51.448 --> 03:07:53.610
TRAVIS: We should move quickly.

03:07:53.610 --> 03:07:55.830
MATT: They head to the rest of their day's work.

03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:58.218
LAURA: Up and out, I say.

03:07:58.219 --> 03:08:01.209
TALIESIN: Hyah.

03:08:01.209 --> 03:08:02.999
SAM: Yep, that.

03:08:02.999 --> 03:08:04.675
TALIESIN: Let's go, guys.

03:08:04.675 --> 03:08:06.148
TRAVIS: Nott, give us a hyah.

03:08:06.148 --> 03:08:07.066
SAM: Hyah!

03:08:07.164 --> 03:08:08.541
TRAVIS: There we go.

03:08:08.541 --> 03:08:10.210
TALIESIN: The horses are going to go if I
ask them to--

03:08:10.210 --> 03:08:12.224
SAM: Git along, little doggies!

03:08:12.224 --> 03:08:20.749
MATT: Okay, I'll say from Alfield's about a
three-and-a-half days' travel. Gathering your

03:08:20.749 --> 03:08:25.842
supplies there, making your way eastward
towards Felderwin, is there any business

03:08:25.843 --> 03:08:27.795
you wish to attend to on the way?

03:08:27.795 --> 03:08:29.254
LAURA: Hey, Caduceus?

03:08:29.254 --> 03:08:30.449
TALIESIN: Yeah?

03:08:30.449 --> 03:08:33.867
TRAVIS: The Rillway Road, and we're going
to get to a bridge before we hit Felderwin.

03:08:33.867 --> 03:08:43.902
LAURA: I want to have wrapped up the little
cookbooks that I bought, nice and pretty.

03:08:43.902 --> 03:08:46.482
I used the ribbon from my mom's house.

03:08:46.482 --> 03:08:47.899
MATT: Okay.

03:08:47.899 --> 03:08:49.644
LAURA: I got you a present.

03:08:49.644 --> 03:08:52.870
TALIESIN: Thank you! Aww, that's so nice.

03:08:52.870 --> 03:08:56.857
LAURA: They're cookbooks, and one of them
uses mushrooms a lot!

03:08:56.857 --> 03:08:58.852
TALIESIN: Aww, that's so exciting!

03:08:58.852 --> 03:09:00.552
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:00.552 --> 03:09:01.708
TALIESIN: Wow!

03:09:01.708 --> 03:09:02.718
LAURA: Just in case, you know, you wanted
to change up your recipes, or you

03:09:02.718 --> 03:09:05.680
thought you needed anything cool like that.

03:09:05.680 --> 03:09:08.771
TALIESIN: It never even occurred to me that you
get a book about cooking. That's so great.

03:09:08.771 --> 03:09:11.608
LAURA: Right? The pictures are really nice.

03:09:11.608 --> 03:09:17.198
TALIESIN: Yeah, the illustrations are amazing.
Yeah. Oh, this is cool. Aww, thank you.

03:09:17.198 --> 03:09:18.901
LAURA: You're welcome.

03:09:18.901 --> 03:09:23.012
LIAM: He's 7'5". She's 5'1".

03:09:23.013 --> 03:09:30.228
TALIESIN: I'm going to do my best to make
it through this mushroom cookbook.

03:09:30.228 --> 03:09:34.368
MARISHA: Oh no.

03:09:34.368 --> 03:09:41.590
LIAM: Not a whole thing, but I've gone through
most of the paper purchased, and read the history

03:09:41.590 --> 03:09:47.084
of Nicodranas, (goofy voice) the general
knowledge of the history of Nicodranas.

03:09:47.084 --> 03:09:50.617
MATT: (equally goofy voice) There you go.
I'll send you an email later. Congratulations.

03:09:50.617 --> 03:09:54.677
(normal voice) That, my friends,
is the sound of history.

03:09:54.677 --> 03:09:57.198
TALIESIN: I've often wondered.

03:09:57.198 --> 03:10:01.185
LIAM: (goofy voice) Their main export
is oysters. Carry on.

03:10:01.185 --> 03:10:09.180
SAM: You meet a dragon. "What is
the main export of Nicodranas?"

03:10:09.181 --> 03:10:19.622
MATT: "No! I've been defeated! Curse
your worldly understanding of trade!"

03:10:19.622 --> 03:10:26.355
LIAM: "I knew I should have gone with entertainment
as the subject! You get a piece of the pie!"

03:10:26.355 --> 03:10:36.079
MATT: Take your orange piece! That's not even
an orange piece. Anyway, in crossing the bridge

03:10:36.189 --> 03:10:45.973
to cross the Eistus River, cresting the hills before
it, you can already see the low haze of gray and

03:10:45.973 --> 03:10:56.818
brown that's gently fading over the region. As you
reach the peak and look down upon the familiar

03:10:56.818 --> 03:11:00.877
sight of the once-green farmland that you had
passed by when you were heading north toward

03:11:00.878 --> 03:11:08.600
Shadycreek Run, you can already see a fair patch
of the Tillage lies black and ashen. Probably a

03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:15.910
quarter of it. As you begin to make your way
towards the outskirts of the city, you can already

03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:24.476
see small squadrons of Righteous Brand patrolling
the fields. I mean, a dozen small squadrons of

03:11:24.477 --> 03:11:26.591
about 50 soldiers each.

03:11:26.591 --> 03:11:28.011
MARISHA: (whistles)

03:11:28.011 --> 03:11:30.930
MATT: You can see quite a few military has been
relegated and probably sent southward from

03:11:30.930 --> 03:11:41.056
Bladegarden since this incursion a few weeks back.
As you come upon the outside of Felderwin, which

03:11:41.056 --> 03:11:47.218
is built not too far from the Eistus River, you
can already see there are a number of buildings

03:11:47.218 --> 03:11:56.892
burned and blackened on the opposite end of the
fields. The fields are on the northern side of the

03:11:56.892 --> 03:12:05.173
city. On the southeastern side, there's a section
of the town that appears to have burned or burnt

03:12:05.173 --> 03:12:07.820
down to varying degrees, depending on buildings.

03:12:07.820 --> 03:12:10.878
SAM: I'm going to put my hood up, the mask on.

03:12:10.879 --> 03:12:12.430
MATT: Okay. Anyone else?

03:12:12.605 --> 03:12:15.916
TALIESIN: I'll human up for a second.

03:12:15.916 --> 03:12:17.857
LAURA: Nott, where are--

03:12:17.857 --> 03:12:19.554
SAM: Yeah, no. Yeah?

03:12:19.554 --> 03:12:27.766
LAURA: Where is your family? Where are they
located? I'm sure not the actual city-city, right?

03:12:28.084 --> 03:12:31.157
SAM: You mean the clan?

03:12:31.157 --> 03:12:33.087
LAURA: Yeah?

03:12:33.087 --> 03:12:35.399
SAM: No, they don't live in the city.

03:12:35.399 --> 03:12:37.704
LAURA: What about... you know?

03:12:37.704 --> 03:12:40.147
SAM: The fellow? My friend?

03:12:40.148 --> 03:12:41.928
LAURA: Yeah, the guy.

03:12:41.928 --> 03:12:47.834
SAM: Yeah, they're in the city. He's in the city
somewhere. Yeah, I know where the house is.

03:12:47.835 --> 03:12:52.892
I'll lead them towards--

03:12:52.892 --> 03:12:58.816
MATT: Okay, lead them to the city. You see that
there are crownsguard, a little more than usual.

03:12:58.817 --> 03:13:04.891
Definitely on the perimeter of the city, you can
see bands of ten to 12 Righteous Brand set along

03:13:04.891 --> 03:13:15.045
at fairly intense positions to look outward.
They're doing their best to lock things down as

03:13:15.045 --> 03:13:18.258
this investigation is still being completed
as to what transpired here.

03:13:18.258 --> 03:13:21.244
SAM: I'm going to start heavily drinking.

03:13:21.244 --> 03:13:32.171
MATT: You make your way to that part of the city.
Glancing over towards the first main plaza

03:13:32.171 --> 03:13:37.777
intersection of this part of Felderwin, there's
a few people talking. A blue flash catches

03:13:37.777 --> 03:13:42.432
your attention out of the corner of your eye.
You see three Righteous Brand soldiers that are

03:13:42.491 --> 03:13:46.302
standing with an elven woman in fine
flowing clothes of green and black.

03:13:46.302 --> 03:13:53.425
She angrily gives a few offhanded orders
at a distance, while it looks like the

03:13:53.425 --> 03:14:00.014
source of this blue flash, a male figure,
is standing where previously was not.

03:14:00.014 --> 03:14:02.339
MARISHA: Oh shit, okay.

03:14:02.339 --> 03:14:09.459
MATT: This figure that apparates is wearing deep
blue robes and appears to be elven, with very long

03:14:09.459 --> 03:14:16.409
white hair. Also an elder elf, though of pale skin
in comparison to the one you met previously.

03:14:16.409 --> 03:14:26.095
Approaches with haste towards this woman. They
begin to whisper for a moment before he shoos off

03:14:26.095 --> 03:14:32.531
the rest of the guards, and the two of them begin to
walk together, the pair of them having a conversation.

03:14:32.532 --> 03:14:35.907
MARISHA: Caleb?

03:14:35.907 --> 03:14:38.193
SAM: I don't recognize either?

03:14:38.193 --> 03:14:39.850
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:14:39.851 --> 03:14:41.839
MARISHA: You recognize those people?

03:14:41.839 --> 03:14:43.507
SAM: 19.

03:14:43.507 --> 03:14:48.650
MATT: You see them. You don't recognize them.

03:14:48.650 --> 03:14:51.533
LAURA: Did you recognize them?

03:14:51.533 --> 03:14:53.761
TRAVIS: You said they look like
someone we met previously?

03:14:53.762 --> 03:14:57.139
MATT: Meaning it was a male elder
elven figure, but--

03:14:57.139 --> 03:14:58.924
LAURA: Just like Yussa.

03:14:58.924 --> 03:15:05.742
MATT: Just like Yussa, but Yussa was of Gwardan
descent. This appears to be of northern elf, which

03:15:05.742 --> 03:15:12.085
most of that bloodline stems from Malaismere
and what split off into Bysaes Tyl.

03:15:12.085 --> 03:15:16.292
LAURA: Learn about that too, okay?

03:15:16.292 --> 03:15:18.762
TALIESIN: You've got a lot of reading
to do this weekend.

03:15:18.763 --> 03:15:22.521
MARISHA: My notes look like a serial killer's.
It's bad.

03:15:22.521 --> 03:15:27.523
MATT: They're talking amongst each other and
then walk and disappear around a corner.

03:15:27.523 --> 03:15:29.459
LAURA: Did we hear anything they said?

03:15:29.459 --> 03:15:31.213
MATT: You're too far away.

03:15:31.213 --> 03:15:35.652
LAURA: Okay. Man, I wish I could read lips.

03:15:35.652 --> 03:15:37.905
SAM: Do you want me to go sneak up or anything?

03:15:37.905 --> 03:15:39.773
TRAVIS: Was the blue flash from him apparating?

03:15:39.773 --> 03:15:43.337
MATT: Yes. Do you continue on?

03:15:43.337 --> 03:15:44.698
LAURA: Yeah?

03:15:44.699 --> 03:15:48.198
SAM: I guess. Are we curious about that?

03:15:48.198 --> 03:15:49.921
TRAVIS: Yes, we are!

03:15:49.921 --> 03:15:52.629
LIAM: Do I recognize that person from
my time at school?

03:15:52.629 --> 03:15:57.822
MATT: You recognize both of them.

03:15:57.822 --> 03:16:02.280
SAM: (gasps) Holy boly. All you've got
to do is ask.

03:16:02.280 --> 03:16:08.426
MATT: The woman is Lady Vess DeRogna, the Archmage
of Antiquity at the Cerberus Assembly.

03:16:08.426 --> 03:16:10.625
LIAM: Sorry, I didn't hear you there.

03:16:10.625 --> 03:16:17.164
MATT: Lady Vess DeRogna, the Archmage of
Antiquity of the Cerberus Assembly.

03:16:17.164 --> 03:16:19.213
LIAM: (gagging)

03:16:19.213 --> 03:16:22.458
SAM: Archmage of something, Cerberus Assembly.

03:16:22.458 --> 03:16:23.966
MATT: Antiquity.

03:16:23.966 --> 03:16:26.459
MARISHA: Antiquity at the Cerberus--

03:16:26.459 --> 03:16:28.343
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

03:16:28.343 --> 03:16:31.014
SAM: Oh my god, I'm shaking right now.

03:16:31.014 --> 03:16:32.882
LIAM: I recognize them.

03:16:32.882 --> 03:16:37.405
TALIESIN: Percy's in my head dissecting that title
so hard right now. I can't, though. I don't know.

03:16:37.406 --> 03:16:44.398
MATT: The man, the elder elf, is Martinet Lunidus
Da'leth.

03:16:44.398 --> 03:16:46.919
LIAM: One more time, please.

03:16:46.919 --> 03:16:48.297
MARISHA: Largemont?

03:16:48.297 --> 03:16:55.372
MATT: Martinet. Lunidus. L-U-N-I-D-U-S. Da'leth.
D-A-apostrophe-L-E-T-H.

03:16:55.372 --> 03:16:59.813
TRAVIS: Nope. I get two letters in
and that's all she wrote.

03:16:59.813 --> 03:17:01.797
SAM and MARISHA: MLD!

03:17:01.797 --> 03:17:04.660
MATT: This won't come back to bite you.

03:17:04.660 --> 03:17:06.753
LAURA: Martinet Lunidus-- that's all I got.

03:17:06.753 --> 03:17:09.250
SAM: He's making the names so hard now
that we can't make fun of them.

03:17:09.250 --> 03:17:10.527
LAURA: I know!

03:17:10.527 --> 03:17:15.568
LIAM: These are names I got on a list over
a year ago that I'm remembering now.

03:17:15.568 --> 03:17:17.476
SAM: What is he the Archmage of?

03:17:17.477 --> 03:17:19.463
MATT: Archmage of Domestic Protections.

03:17:19.463 --> 03:17:21.784
MARISHA: Oh jeez, he's Homeland Security!

03:17:21.784 --> 03:17:23.667
LIAM: I'm going to go fucking dig through
my emails. Jesus.

03:17:23.667 --> 03:17:25.097
MARISHA: Wait, Archmage of what?

03:17:25.097 --> 03:17:26.700
MATT: Domestic Protection.

03:17:26.701 --> 03:17:31.080
LIAM: We're fine. We're just going into Nott's
backstory. I don't need to review nothing.

03:17:31.223 --> 03:17:33.838
TRAVIS: Lady Ve DeRogna?

03:17:33.838 --> 03:17:35.461
SAM: Vess DeRogna.

03:17:35.461 --> 03:17:37.946
TRAVIS: Lasagna?

03:17:37.946 --> 03:17:39.712
SAM: Yep.

03:17:39.712 --> 03:17:41.159
TRAVIS: What is it? Vess--

03:17:41.159 --> 03:17:42.605
MATT: DeRogna.

03:17:42.605 --> 03:17:45.063
MARISHA: Fuck! Domestic Protection.

03:17:45.063 --> 03:17:49.197
TRAVIS: Nope, not there. Yeah. Lady Vess DeRogna.

03:17:49.197 --> 03:17:58.180
LIAM: If that is the case, and we're in the wagon at
this point, Caleb just fucking lies down in the cart.

03:17:58.180 --> 03:18:00.828
TALIESIN: As long as you're in the back,
they can't see.

03:18:00.828 --> 03:18:02.754
LIAM: Yeah. Lies down in the cart.

03:18:02.755 --> 03:18:06.981
LAURA: What's going on? Are you sleepy?
Are you getting sleepy, Caleb?

03:18:06.981 --> 03:18:09.611
SAM: No, there's people out there he knows,
you dummy.

03:18:09.612 --> 03:18:11.470
TALIESIN: We're moving on anyway.

03:18:11.470 --> 03:18:13.223
MATT: You guys continue on.

03:18:13.223 --> 03:18:17.349
SAM: I'm a little on edge. You're not dumb.

03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:30.728
MATT: You head down that eastern thoroughfare,
passing by a number of homes and businesses. You

03:18:30.728 --> 03:18:37.032
start coming upon the ones that were damaged. You
see one looks to be a warehouse that burned down.

03:18:37.032 --> 03:18:41.825
There is an inn called the Glassy Grass Inn
that you're familiar with, Nott.

03:18:41.825 --> 03:18:43.494
SAM: Glassy Grass?

03:18:43.494 --> 03:18:48.870
MATT: That has burned to the ground. There
is another building next to that. There is

03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:56.220
the Brenatto Apothecary that is also burned
to the ground. There are people rummaging

03:18:56.220 --> 03:19:01.490
through the rubble, through some of their
homes, still looking and pulling out

03:19:01.490 --> 03:19:05.202
elements of whatever they can gather
of their former life.

03:19:05.202 --> 03:19:07.458
SAM: Stop the cart.

03:19:07.459 --> 03:19:10.741
LAURA: (neighing)

03:19:10.741 --> 03:19:13.438
SAM: Is anyone around?

03:19:13.438 --> 03:19:19.175
MATT: You can see there is a crownsguard-- a
pair of crownsguard that are walking this way.

03:19:19.175 --> 03:19:29.870
SAM: I'll cast Disguise Self and be some
gnomish old lady. I'm going to walk over

03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:34.941
to the burned-down apothecary
and start looking around.

03:19:34.941 --> 03:19:41.380
MATT: For anything in particular, or just trying
to make it look like you're looking around?

03:19:41.380 --> 03:19:46.710
SAM: I'm looking for identifying
signs of life or--

03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:48.461
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:19:48.461 --> 03:19:50.256
SAM: 15.

03:19:50.256 --> 03:19:59.578
MATT: You glance around, looking through the
visible rubble, moving a few things. Don't appear

03:19:59.578 --> 03:20:06.370
to be any signs of life, nor any signs
of death, immediately.

03:20:06.371 --> 03:20:09.588
SAM: Can I look for buttons?

03:20:09.588 --> 03:20:14.425
MATT: Make an investigation check
now that you're poring through.

03:20:14.425 --> 03:20:18.848
SAM: Aw shit. 11.

03:20:18.848 --> 03:20:24.953
MATT: Unfortunately, in this scattering of
rubble-- I mean, you can still see the frame of

03:20:24.953 --> 03:20:30.747
the building standing, with an element of the roof
that's still there, but most of it has fallen

03:20:30.747 --> 03:20:36.181
inward. This was a place of business that appeared
to have a few rooms of homestead attached to the

03:20:36.182 --> 03:20:42.956
back of it, but all that has burned and fallen in.
The crownsguard walk by and stop. One of them,

03:20:42.956 --> 03:20:47.278
a female, looks over and goes, "Hey,
you looking for help?"

03:20:47.278 --> 03:20:54.564
SAM: No, I was just looking to see--
I knew the man who worked here.

03:20:54.564 --> 03:20:57.168
MATT: "It's terrible, isn't it?"

03:20:57.168 --> 03:20:59.248
SAM: What's terrible? What happened?

03:20:59.248 --> 03:21:04.068
MATT: "We don't get this kind of thing this far
west. We're not supposed to. I don't want to

03:21:04.068 --> 03:21:05.672
"fight those things."

03:21:05.673 --> 03:21:07.171
SAM: What things?

03:21:07.171 --> 03:21:09.533
MATT: "The cricks. The things that came in
and did this."

03:21:09.533 --> 03:21:13.550
SAM: Do you know what-- were you here? Do
you know what happened to this place?

03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:15.018
MATT: "Yeza?"

03:21:15.018 --> 03:21:16.245
SAM: Yes.

03:21:16.245 --> 03:21:21.913
MATT: "I don't know. They haven't found a body,
so that's something. His boy Luke was found safe

03:21:21.913 --> 03:21:27.478
"and is staying with... what's her name?"
Looks over to the other guy. The other person,

03:21:27.478 --> 03:21:32.717
the woman, looks at him and goes,
"At Old Edith's house."

03:21:32.717 --> 03:21:35.224
SAM: Do I know Edith?

03:21:35.224 --> 03:21:38.981
MATT: You know of Old Edith, yeah. An older
woman a few buildings down.

03:21:38.981 --> 03:21:40.893
SAM: He's okay?

03:21:40.893 --> 03:21:42.896
MATT: "Yeah, Luke's okay."

03:21:42.896 --> 03:21:50.412
SAM: Did the party that came in to attack-- were
they taking prisoners, or were they killing?

03:21:50.412 --> 03:22:00.691
MATT: "From what I heard, they just burned and
slashed. Just under a hundred crownsguard were

03:22:00.691 --> 03:22:11.273
"killed, a few of my friends. 14 civilians died
in the fires. It was the weirdest thing.

03:22:11.273 --> 03:22:22.444
"I watched friends of mine begin
to slow down. Anyway."

03:22:22.444 --> 03:22:24.909
SAM: Were you there?

03:22:24.909 --> 03:22:28.498
MATT: "Yeah. Thankfully not on the front line."

03:22:28.498 --> 03:22:37.133
SAM: How did they get away, the cricks?
Did they go underground?

03:22:37.133 --> 03:22:41.980
MATT: "They went back where they came, through
the tunnels, and collapsed them behind them."

03:22:41.980 --> 03:22:44.413
SAM: Which tunnels? Where?

03:22:44.413 --> 03:22:55.051
MATT: "There. Between the city and the tillage." He
points in the direction where those two were walking.

03:22:55.051 --> 03:23:01.313
SAM: All right. Thank you.
I'm sorry for your loss.

03:23:01.313 --> 03:23:03.406
MATT: "Did you know them?"

03:23:03.407 --> 03:23:05.439
SAM: Yes.

03:23:05.439 --> 03:23:10.663
MATT: "I'm sorry for yours, too." The two
continue walking.

03:23:10.663 --> 03:23:12.440
LAURA: Nott?

03:23:12.440 --> 03:23:13.847
SAM: Hmm?

03:23:13.847 --> 03:23:17.101
LAURA: Do you want help looking?

03:23:17.102 --> 03:23:26.872
SAM: Yes. If you could, could you look
around this wreckage a bit and see

03:23:26.872 --> 03:23:29.599
if you find anything interesting?

03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:30.976
LAURA: Of course.

03:23:30.976 --> 03:23:34.808
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a general look
around to see if I can get a sign of life

03:23:34.808 --> 03:23:38.029
coming from anywhere in the rubble.

03:23:38.029 --> 03:23:40.919
MATT: This would be more of an investigation,
since you're looking through rubble

03:23:40.919 --> 03:23:43.457
as opposed to peering through.

03:23:43.457 --> 03:23:45.464
LIAM: Where are the nearest guards
at this moment?

03:23:45.464 --> 03:23:47.037
MATT: The ones that you were just speaking to.

03:23:47.037 --> 03:23:48.609
LIAM: They walked off?

03:23:48.609 --> 03:23:50.230
MATT: They're walking off now.

03:23:50.230 --> 03:23:57.836
LIAM: I'm going to hop out of the cart, go over
to Nott, and trip. Fall face flat into the dirt.

03:23:57.836 --> 03:24:06.239
Wipe dirt on my face and into my beard,
stand up, and pull my hood up.

03:24:06.239 --> 03:24:09.892
LAURA: I'm going to help Nott search
through the rubble.

03:24:09.892 --> 03:24:12.391
LIAM: Yes, I'm going to start searching
through the rubble.

03:24:12.391 --> 03:24:13.653
MARISHA: Same.

03:24:13.653 --> 03:24:16.737
MATT: Let's make an investigation check
as a group. One of you helms it.

03:24:16.737 --> 03:24:18.469
LIAM: I'll helm it.

03:24:18.469 --> 03:24:20.934
MATT: With their help, you have advantage
on the roll.

03:24:20.934 --> 03:24:35.024
LIAM: Holy shit. Let's roll this die.
Ooh, two 14s. That is a 23.

03:24:35.053 --> 03:24:46.231
MATT: You find a bunch of shattered alchemist's
equipment: glass vials, metallic containers of

03:24:46.350 --> 03:24:54.355
different kinds that all have charred elements to
them. You find in a back room elements of bedding

03:24:54.355 --> 03:24:59.670
that are mostly burned away, some child's toys,
wooden, that have been charred and burned

03:24:59.670 --> 03:25:07.836
to a crisp. No signs of any bodies. You do
find the basement, which you do know of.

03:25:07.836 --> 03:25:10.541
The basement door is locked.

03:25:10.541 --> 03:25:13.828
SAM: I will unlock it.

03:25:13.828 --> 03:25:16.305
MATT: Go ahead and make an attempt.

03:25:16.305 --> 03:25:19.925
SAM: Not good. 15.

03:25:19.925 --> 03:25:24.137
MATT: It's not moving at all.

03:25:24.137 --> 03:25:26.110
SAM: Jester, open the door.

03:25:26.110 --> 03:25:27.684
LAURA: Okay.

03:25:27.684 --> 03:25:29.198
LIAM: I'm casting Mage Armor.

03:25:29.199 --> 03:25:30.844
SAM: Caleb. Open it.

03:25:30.844 --> 03:25:32.542
LAURA: I try to slam into the door to open it.

03:25:32.542 --> 03:25:34.022
MATT: Make a strength check.

03:25:34.023 --> 03:25:38.860
LAURA: Ten.

03:25:38.860 --> 03:25:41.639
MATT: It's not budging.

03:25:41.639 --> 03:25:45.242
LAURA: I'm sorry, Nott. Yasha?

03:25:45.242 --> 03:25:53.728
MATT: Yasha's going to get extremely angry and
rage and attempt to make her way through.

03:25:53.728 --> 03:25:56.089
At advantage, strength check.

03:25:56.089 --> 03:25:58.499
TRAVIS: That's a 19.

03:25:58.499 --> 03:26:06.813
MATT: (thud) It's not budging. That lock is holding
tight, far more than it should for its design.

03:26:06.813 --> 03:26:09.213
SAM: Is it magical?

03:26:09.213 --> 03:26:12.307
LAURA: Maybe I can cast Dispel Magic?
Is it magic? Is it trapped?

03:26:12.308 --> 03:26:15.222
SAM: It wasn't.

03:26:15.222 --> 03:26:19.135
LAURA: I'm going to cast Dispel Magic.

03:26:19.135 --> 03:26:33.209
MATT: Okay. Yeah, that'll do it. The Arcane Lock
on it dissipates, and the pressure that has been

03:26:33.209 --> 03:26:39.344
placed on it-- we'll say the lock falls open.
Do you open the basement?

03:26:39.344 --> 03:26:40.817
SAM: Mm-hmm.

03:26:40.817 --> 03:26:45.605
MATT: Stepping down the stairs underneath, it's a
small chamber, no more than 15 by 15 feet. The

03:26:45.605 --> 03:26:54.109
room is tossed, not like you remember. There's
a pile of broken table shards in the far right

03:26:54.109 --> 03:26:59.882
corner. There's additional shattered glass all
over the floor here. There's an iron chest,

03:26:59.882 --> 03:27:05.063
roughly three feet long by a foot wide, that sits
in the far left corner. A single chair holds the

03:27:05.063 --> 03:27:10.266
center of the room. That's what remains inside.

03:27:10.266 --> 03:27:12.885
TALIESIN: Lighting it up in here.

03:27:12.885 --> 03:27:24.737
SAM: Does it look like there was a struggle in here,
or it's been turned by someone looking for something?

03:27:24.737 --> 03:27:26.418
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:27:26.418 --> 03:27:27.881
LIAM: Or blood, or injury.

03:27:27.881 --> 03:27:29.230
LAURA: Or maybe they came in through--

03:27:29.230 --> 03:27:31.029
SAM: 22. 21.

03:27:31.029 --> 03:27:36.792
MATT: It looks like there was definitely a
struggle in here. Looking at the walls, it looks

03:27:36.792 --> 03:27:41.134
like there are blade scrapes against bits of
stone. A lot of the furniture in here has been

03:27:41.134 --> 03:27:46.945
destroyed as part of that from heavy impacts.
But the center chair seems perfect.

03:27:46.945 --> 03:27:56.988
TALIESIN: Huh. You know what that makes me
think of? I mean, that seems-- that's weird.

03:27:56.988 --> 03:28:01.048
MARISHA: I mean, did you want to finish that?

03:28:01.049 --> 03:28:07.042
TALIESIN: I figured you would know
because I'm guessing.

03:28:07.042 --> 03:28:11.449
MARISHA: I have an idea. I have my opinion. I'm
just curious–

03:28:11.450 --> 03:28:13.094
TALIESIN: Well, what's your opinion?

03:28:13.094 --> 03:28:15.101
MARISHA: Someone was interrogated.

03:28:15.101 --> 03:28:16.711
TALIESIN: That's way better than mine.
Never mind.

03:28:16.711 --> 03:28:18.124
MARISHA: What was yours?

03:28:18.124 --> 03:28:21.376
TALIESIN: I was thinking that maybe there was
an invisible person tied to the chair.

03:28:21.376 --> 03:28:24.498
SAM: That's way worse. Yours is much better.

03:28:24.498 --> 03:28:29.179
LAURA: I go up, and can I touch and see if
there's an invisible person in the chair?

03:28:29.179 --> 03:28:30.836
MATT: There is not an invisible person.

03:28:30.836 --> 03:28:32.857
TALIESIN: I really appreciate that.
I was a little spooked.

03:28:32.857 --> 03:28:35.124
LIAM: That's the Mighty Nein special.

03:28:35.124 --> 03:28:44.319
MARISHA: Nott. You clearly have some
personal attachment to this.

03:28:44.319 --> 03:28:49.190
LAURA: I'm going to sit in the chair and see what
I see. What does it look like from the chair?

03:28:49.191 --> 03:28:51.602
MATT: It looks like the room.

03:28:51.602 --> 03:28:53.696
LIAM: She's Will Graham-ing it.

03:28:53.696 --> 03:28:55.539
TALIESIN: You're tearing me apart.

03:28:55.539 --> 03:28:57.861
MATT: Based on your investigation check,
you gather that the chair was probably

03:28:57.861 --> 03:29:01.137
placed here after this, whatever transpired
in this room.

03:29:01.137 --> 03:29:06.496
MARISHA: What would someone want from here?

03:29:06.496 --> 03:29:09.445
SAM: I don't know.

03:29:09.445 --> 03:29:11.555
TRAVIS: Is there another way out of here?

03:29:11.555 --> 03:29:14.177
SAM: Chemicals. There was chemicals here.
He kept chemicals.

03:29:14.177 --> 03:29:15.878
TRAVIS: Second set of stairs into the house?

03:29:15.879 --> 03:29:17.693
MATT: There is no other exit from this chamber.

03:29:17.693 --> 03:29:19.536
TALIESIN: No hidden ones, nothing?

03:29:19.537 --> 03:29:20.830
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:29:20.830 --> 03:29:22.434
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll search with him.

03:29:22.434 --> 03:29:24.324
MATT: Make your separate rolls here.
Oh, are you helping?

03:29:24.325 --> 03:29:25.963
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll help.

03:29:25.963 --> 03:29:27.743
MATT: So you get advantage on this.

03:29:27.743 --> 03:29:29.438
SAM: There's a box, you said?

03:29:29.438 --> 03:29:31.149
MATT: There's an iron chest.

03:29:31.149 --> 03:29:32.393
TRAVIS: 21.

03:29:32.393 --> 03:29:37.102
MATT: As you guys are inspecting all this, you
and Caduceus are giving a fair play on the walls.

03:29:37.103 --> 03:29:42.100
No doors, no other exits. It's just that
stairway, from what you can find.

03:29:42.100 --> 03:29:46.031
TALIESIN: That chest, it's probably trapped.
We should be very careful.

03:29:46.031 --> 03:29:50.037
SAM: I'm going to go over and open it.
Or is it locked?

03:29:50.037 --> 03:29:51.202
MATT: It is locked.

03:29:51.202 --> 03:29:54.302
SAM: I will unlock it. That's 29.

03:29:54.302 --> 03:30:01.346
MATT: That breaks the Arcane Lock on it.
In spite of the resistance, the spell,

03:30:01.346 --> 03:30:09.320
you (click) and see a brief (poof) as the
Arcane Lock is dispelled and unlocked.

03:30:09.320 --> 03:30:10.689
SAM: I open it.

03:30:10.689 --> 03:30:13.439
MATT: You open it up. Make a constitution
saving throw for me, please.

03:30:13.439 --> 03:30:17.930
SAM: 19.

03:30:17.930 --> 03:30:27.977
MATT: A brief puff of what looks like a dull black
gas (small explosion) in your face, and you pull

03:30:27.977 --> 03:30:33.960
out of the way and inhale a little bit. It's a
weird dizzying sensation that comes over

03:30:33.960 --> 03:30:36.757
your body for a second, but
you manage to shrug it off.

03:30:36.757 --> 03:30:39.119
SAM: I'll take another drink of booze
and look in there.

03:30:39.120 --> 03:30:47.052
MATT: You see inside a retractable silver tripod
of some kind. The apex looks like it's set to hold

03:30:47.052 --> 03:30:51.748
something. It's three of them that come together,
and you imagine, where it'd open up, there's

03:30:51.748 --> 03:30:58.314
a little platform beneath it. They all don't
meet, really, at the top. There's three things

03:30:58.314 --> 03:31:00.386
that are set to hold a device of some kind.

03:31:00.386 --> 03:31:01.824
SAM: Hold something.

03:31:01.824 --> 03:31:04.537
LAURA: Like maybe this old dodecahedron
down here?

03:31:04.537 --> 03:31:13.075
SAM: Maybe. Does it look like the same metal of
the dodecahedron? Any similar characteristics?

03:31:13.075 --> 03:31:17.056
MATT: It doesn't look like it has similar
characteristics or metal, per se,

03:31:17.056 --> 03:31:19.389
but you can try and fit it in if you want to.

03:31:19.389 --> 03:31:20.877
TALIESIN: Later, somewhere else.

03:31:20.877 --> 03:31:22.119
SAM: Try it?

03:31:22.119 --> 03:31:23.446
TALIESIN: Somewhere else.

03:31:23.446 --> 03:31:24.552
LAURA: Not here.

03:31:24.552 --> 03:31:27.383
LIAM: Let's get out of here. Let's take it to--
have you ever seen this before?

03:31:27.383 --> 03:31:30.704
SAM: No. No, I've never seen this before.

03:31:30.704 --> 03:31:32.974
TALIESIN: Anything else in the chest?

03:31:32.974 --> 03:31:41.363
MATT: Yes, there are three empty vials. One full
one that seems to contain-- it seems like it's on

03:31:41.363 --> 03:31:45.923
the verge of liquid and gas. There is liquid in
there, but a lot of it seems to be this heavy,

03:31:45.963 --> 03:31:48.830
fog-like condensation, a dull gray color.

03:31:48.830 --> 03:31:51.582
SAM: I'll grab it and throw it to Caleb.

03:31:51.582 --> 03:32:00.821
MATT: There appears to be a conglomeration
of notes that were destroyed, burned.

03:32:00.821 --> 03:32:09.877
Most of it looks like shreds that are piled
up in case someone were to attempt to try

03:32:09.877 --> 03:32:16.308
and do something with it later. There are two
pieces of paper that appear to be still legible.

03:32:16.308 --> 03:32:19.134
(cheering)

03:32:19.134 --> 03:32:21.843
TRAVIS: And a picture, and a picture!

03:32:21.843 --> 03:32:30.328
SAM: "As we continue to invoke the beacon with
extremely focused energy of different spectrums

03:32:30.328 --> 03:32:38.726
"and sources, the effects unleashed are curious, and
reach far beyond this laboratory. The dunamis field--"

03:32:38.727 --> 03:32:41.930
Is that right? Have we heard that before?

03:32:41.930 --> 03:32:43.416
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:43.416 --> 03:32:49.663
SAM: "-- sightlessly encompassed an entire portion
of the town, with locals complaining of an ill,

03:32:49.663 --> 03:32:55.671
"sluggish sensation--" that's the Slow "--being

03:33:03.787 --> 03:33:07.666
MARISHA: That guy mentioned people feeling slow.

03:33:07.666 --> 03:33:14.302
SAM: "Based on our previous experiments and extracted
techniques from captured Kryn operatives--"

03:33:14.302 --> 03:33:18.203
LAURA: Wait, "rumors we squashed by
spreading a batch of molded fruit crop."

03:33:18.203 --> 03:33:20.568
SAM: Yeah. Kryn operatives?

03:33:20.568 --> 03:33:23.650
LAURA: Kryn, that's what they actually are.

03:33:23.650 --> 03:33:29.584
SAM: "Based on our previous experiments extracted
from captured Kryn operatives, the abilities of

03:33:29.585 --> 03:33:35.982
"dunamis and dunamancy within Xhorhas appears to
focus around the manipulation of gravity--"

03:33:35.982 --> 03:33:38.038
MARISHA: Time. Yeah, gravity and time.

03:33:38.038 --> 03:33:43.970
SAM: "--entropy, and time. Yet, while the basis of
what dunamancy origin glyphs we were able to

03:33:43.970 --> 03:33:49.843
"acquire show it to exist outside of the
established schools of magic--" What you got?

03:33:49.844 --> 03:33:51.458
LIAM: May I?

03:33:51.458 --> 03:33:52.601
SAM: Yes.

03:33:52.601 --> 03:33:55.638
LAURA: (gasps) "Blah blah blah, extremely
difficult to work with. Attempts to isolate

03:33:55.638 --> 03:34:01.435
"a substance capable containing and sustaining
the dunamantic energies within a casing has

03:34:01.435 --> 03:34:05.216
"proven both time-consuming and costly--" You
have some of the same stuff. Wait, look--

03:34:05.216 --> 03:34:09.355
SAM: "This magic, by my theory, is deeply rooted
in ancient history of some arcana we take for

"granted. If these beacons are just the surface,
what eons-old rituals have been lurking beneath

03:34:14.629 --> 03:34:20.869
"the citadel in Ghor Dranas?" Ghor Dranas?

03:34:20.869 --> 03:34:24.091
LAURA: I don't know. "In these past weeks,
we have successfully distilled a single vial

03:34:24.091 --> 03:34:30.400
"that should enable a temporary influx of
dunamis to even an untrained soldier.

03:34:30.400 --> 03:34:36.798
"Once I can remove the beacon itself from the
process, I hope to have this alchemist produce

"a number of batches over the next 12 to 16
months, refining the method with each step

03:34:41.864 --> 03:34:46.423
"until we can certify its use in combat."
Is that your friend, the alchemist?

03:34:46.424 --> 03:34:48.523
SAM: They were using the alchemist.
They were using Yeza.

03:34:48.523 --> 03:34:55.843
LAURA: Listen, listen! "Word has found me of Trent
finding a few of his proteges have a knack

"for early dunamancy--" blah blah, something,
something. "I am eager to look over their findings

things I can't read because it's burned away!
"--existence. The dreams are already thrilling."

03:35:14.758 --> 03:35:24.536
SAM: "I'm beginning to believe it goes deeper.
Between the fragments of power we've only begun to

"unlock within these beacons, and the capabilities

them favorably either, though the thought brings

"a laugh to my lips." Do I recognize any
of this handwriting? No?

03:35:46.434 --> 03:35:47.912
MATT: You do not.

03:35:47.913 --> 03:35:49.312
SAM: Does he?

03:35:49.312 --> 03:35:53.480
MATT: You do not recognize any handwriting.

03:35:53.480 --> 03:36:01.818
LAURA: You don't? They're going to be so pissed
when they find out we have that thing.

03:36:01.818 --> 03:36:04.669
MARISHA: We have a beacon. Yeah.
We have a piece of dunamis.

03:36:04.669 --> 03:36:06.730
SAM: We have a vial.

03:36:06.730 --> 03:36:08.872
TRAVIS: We have a tripod.

03:36:08.872 --> 03:36:13.698
MARISHA: I think Jester's right. I think
this dodecahedron goes into that tripod.

03:36:13.699 --> 03:36:15.415
TRAVIS: Hundred percent.

03:36:15.415 --> 03:36:22.234
MARISHA: I don't think we should do it here because,
like Yussa said, we pull this thing out selectively.

03:36:22.234 --> 03:36:28.705
LIAM: How does your friend fit into all of this?

03:36:28.705 --> 03:36:36.008
SAM: I don't know. He's an excellent alchemist.
They would probably need someone like that,

03:36:36.008 --> 03:36:42.401
but the Xhorhasians weren't doing this.
Someone else was. Right? Your people.

03:36:42.401 --> 03:36:44.065
MARISHA: Your people.

03:36:44.065 --> 03:36:50.865
SAM: Your people were doing experiments and
trying to find out and harness the power of--

03:36:50.865 --> 03:36:56.985
What? It's your people! It's the people
that you know and trained with.

03:36:57.100 --> 03:37:01.711
MARISHA: It's because they haven't--
he hasn't, in terms of--

03:37:01.711 --> 03:37:04.038
SAM: Well, fuck him!

03:37:04.039 --> 03:37:05.812
MARISHA: Oh. Wow, yeah.

03:37:05.812 --> 03:37:10.359
SAM: It's your people that have done this to my
people, and we have to find them both.

03:37:10.359 --> 03:37:16.926
TRAVIS: We sent a message once.
Is it worth trying it again?

03:37:16.926 --> 03:37:21.892
SAM: Not right now. I have to go see
Lady Edith right now.

03:37:21.892 --> 03:37:27.939
TALIESIN: Is there any way to
cover our tracks here?

03:37:27.939 --> 03:37:32.819
LIAM: Caleb absolutely pukes
in the middle of the room.

03:37:32.819 --> 03:37:36.628
LAURA: Oh no, that's going to be
way harder to cover up.

03:37:36.629 --> 03:37:51.024
TALIESIN: I got that. Come on. I'm going to
pick up Caleb. You're not at fault here.

03:37:51.024 --> 03:38:00.797
You're the solution here. You know that,
right? We're here to fix this. Don't let

03:38:00.798 --> 03:38:07.516
her anger-- it's not about you.
This is not about you.

03:38:07.516 --> 03:38:12.081
TRAVIS: Anything else in this room that we
need to turn over before we get out?

03:38:12.081 --> 03:38:15.022
MATT: From the investigations that you've
already put through, that seems to be

03:38:15.022 --> 03:38:18.823
most of anything of interest. Everything
else has either been removed, or is just

03:38:18.823 --> 03:38:23.725
broken furniture and whatever
this laboratory once was.

03:38:23.725 --> 03:38:29.916
TRAVIS: Put everything back in the chest and bring
it with us. Put the chest in the haversack.

03:38:29.916 --> 03:38:31.799
MATT: The chest is a little big for a haversack.

03:38:31.799 --> 03:38:33.426
LAURA: We can put the foldable tripod--

03:38:33.426 --> 03:38:34.894
MATT: It's a three-foot by one-foot--

03:38:34.894 --> 03:38:36.682
TALIESIN: Can we re-lock the chest?

03:38:36.682 --> 03:38:40.551
LIAM: The haversack is limited, right?

03:38:40.551 --> 03:38:44.511
MATT: Actually, three-foot by-- you might
be able to fit it in longways into the

03:38:44.512 --> 03:38:48.237
Bag of Holding. The Haversack's pouches
aren't large enough.

03:38:48.237 --> 03:38:50.593
MATT: You do have a Bag of Holding from...

03:38:50.593 --> 03:38:53.010
LIAM: That Fjord is in possession of?

03:38:53.010 --> 03:38:54.703
LAURA: We have a Bag of Holding?

03:38:54.703 --> 03:38:56.778
MATT: You found it under the bed of...

03:38:56.779 --> 03:39:01.070
LIAM: Who has it? I will gladly carry it.

03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:05.020
MATT: My brain's not working.
The Iron Shepherds, with Lorenzo.

03:39:05.020 --> 03:39:07.131
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

03:39:07.131 --> 03:39:12.340
TALIESIN: I think we should try and lock
everything up and maybe break the chair.

03:39:12.341 --> 03:39:14.841
LAURA: Why should we break the chair?

03:39:14.841 --> 03:39:19.448
MARISHA: Can I actually do a little pass
on the chair and see if I see any signs

03:39:19.448 --> 03:39:22.179
that someone's been tied to it,
someone's been questioned?

03:39:22.179 --> 03:39:24.228
TRAVIS: How was it locked from the outside?

03:39:24.228 --> 03:39:26.974
MARISHA: Things that Beau would know that
people would do in her realm?

03:39:26.974 --> 03:39:29.304
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:39:29.304 --> 03:39:32.359
MARISHA: Aww, Jesus fucking Christ. 13.

03:39:32.359 --> 03:39:37.099
MATT: It's a chair that was probably
placed here after this attack.

03:39:37.099 --> 03:39:39.772
MARISHA: We already knew that.

03:39:39.772 --> 03:39:44.517
MATT: I mean, I'll say, based on the chair's
placement, the chest, and the fact that it was

03:39:44.517 --> 03:39:49.839
locked when you left, people had to have come back
in and back out since this attack happened.

03:39:49.839 --> 03:39:57.187
Probably whoever locked this chest put this chair
here and then locked the room as they left.

03:39:57.187 --> 03:39:58.923
LAURA: We need to get out of here.

03:39:58.924 --> 03:40:00.438
TALIESIN: Right now.

03:40:00.438 --> 03:40:01.665
MARISHA: Yeah, I agree.

03:40:01.665 --> 03:40:03.328
LAURA: Let's go. Quickly.

03:40:03.328 --> 03:40:05.145
MARISHA: Fjord?

03:40:05.146 --> 03:40:09.961
TALIESIN: I want to try and-- There's no way to--?
Actually, I'm going to try and lock the chest

03:40:09.961 --> 03:40:15.893
again when we leave. I'm going to use--
not magically, obviously, but Thaumaturgy

03:40:15.893 --> 03:40:19.361
to close it and lock it, or will that
not work with Thaumaturgy?

03:40:19.361 --> 03:40:25.660
MATT: I'll allow it. It's simple enough for
you to do with your hand if you want to.

03:40:25.660 --> 03:40:29.041
It's not Arcane Locked, but it's locked.

03:40:29.041 --> 03:40:31.278
TRAVIS: You didn't see anything when you
sat in the chair, right?

03:40:31.278 --> 03:40:33.730
LAURA: No, I just saw the room.

03:40:33.730 --> 03:40:39.870
TALIESIN: Let's have this conversation elsewhere.
This place is creeping me out.

03:40:39.871 --> 03:40:44.224
LAURA: Was there anything under the chair?
On the underside of the chair?

03:40:44.224 --> 03:40:46.430
MATT: Appears to be a chair.

03:40:46.430 --> 03:40:52.358
SAM: Huh? No? Nothing under the chair?

03:40:52.358 --> 03:40:55.603
TALIESIN: I think we're-- I think we should--

03:40:55.603 --> 03:41:00.054
MARISHA: Someone's come back in. Whoever--

03:41:00.054 --> 03:41:04.113
TRAVIS: Why the chair? Why in middle
of the room? Why lock it?

03:41:04.113 --> 03:41:10.019
MARISHA: Well, the chair is facing the chest,
correct, is what you said? I mean, look at the

03:41:10.019 --> 03:41:13.307
amount of time that we've all lost staring in the
dodecahedron.

03:41:13.307 --> 03:41:22.175
LIAM: Is there anything in my time of torture and
awful that would tell me what this chair is?

03:41:22.175 --> 03:41:29.443
MATT: Yes. It's a chair. It's a standard chair.

03:41:29.443 --> 03:41:33.513
LIAM: No, I don't mean a magic chair. I mean
the setup in the room, the mess around it...?

03:41:33.514 --> 03:41:40.189
MATT: Correct. No, you gather that whoever came
down here last brought the chair with them to

03:41:40.189 --> 03:41:46.805
probably lock their things and leave it here
and then lock the basement behind them,

03:41:46.805 --> 03:41:50.914
not expecting anyone to make their way in
in the interim.

03:41:50.914 --> 03:41:53.273
TALIESIN: We need to go now.

03:41:53.273 --> 03:41:58.095
LAURA: Go, go. Do we need to clean up Caleb's puke?
Will somebody be able to find us with his puke?

03:41:58.095 --> 03:42:00.109
MATT: Caduceus has been cleaning it.

03:42:00.110 --> 03:42:03.230
TALIESIN: I have cleaned it up.
I have beetles; they eat things.

03:42:03.230 --> 03:42:05.490
SAM: We took the trap out? We took the vial?

03:42:05.490 --> 03:42:07.943
TALIESIN: We took everything. We're going.

03:42:07.943 --> 03:42:09.867
MATT: You exit the basement.

03:42:09.868 --> 03:42:11.851
TALIESIN: Lock it as well.

03:42:11.851 --> 03:42:18.062
MATT: Okay. The lock is pretty rough now.
You think it locked. It got bashed open

03:42:18.062 --> 03:42:22.105
by Yasha, and between that and the Dispel,
it's probably not going to hold.

03:42:22.105 --> 03:42:25.605
TALIESIN: Sure. Let's get away from here.

03:42:25.605 --> 03:42:27.366
MARISHA: Nott?

03:42:27.366 --> 03:42:28.574
SAM: What?

03:42:28.574 --> 03:42:29.929
MARISHA: Where do we go?

03:42:29.929 --> 03:42:31.542
SAM: I need to check on--

03:42:31.542 --> 03:42:33.028
MARISHA: You said Old Edith?

03:42:33.028 --> 03:42:35.884
TALIESIN: Lead the way. We're going to
move the cart. You need to not panic.

03:42:35.884 --> 03:42:38.565
TRAVIS: We need to not use that
dodecahedron anymore.

03:42:38.565 --> 03:42:40.189
TALIESIN: Not right around here, no.

03:42:40.189 --> 03:42:43.234
LAURA: Not here, no. It's staying
in the bag, don't worry.

03:42:43.234 --> 03:42:49.536
SAM: I'll take another drink and then look
outside to see if anyone's watching.

03:42:49.536 --> 03:42:55.120
MATT: Okay. You look around the vicinity. It looks
like there are some people who are looking over,

03:42:55.120 --> 03:43:03.732
seeing you in the ruins. They're other civilians,
a couple farmers and townsfolk. They're not

03:43:03.732 --> 03:43:11.374
staring; they're just walking and noticing you all
standing in the rubble. They keep walking.

03:43:11.374 --> 03:43:14.465
SAM: We'll go back to the cart. How far is Edith?

03:43:14.465 --> 03:43:16.838
MATT: Like a five minute walk.

03:43:16.838 --> 03:43:18.831
SAM: Okay. Cart or walk?

03:43:18.831 --> 03:43:21.376
TALIESIN: Cart.

03:43:21.376 --> 03:43:22.839
SAM: Cart? Okay.

03:43:22.839 --> 03:43:27.541
MATT: Okay. You roll the cart along. It's
not even a five minute walk, actually.

03:43:27.541 --> 03:43:29.888
It's a few houses down. It's very quick.

03:43:29.888 --> 03:43:34.553
TALIESIN: I don't want the cart parked in front of
the creepy rubble house. I'm going to move it.

03:43:34.553 --> 03:43:39.499
MATT: You come to the humble hovel of thatched
roof and stone walls where Old Edith lives.

03:43:39.499 --> 03:43:42.403
The door is currently closed.

03:43:42.403 --> 03:43:54.682
SAM: I'll Disguise Self as a halfling. Plump face,
tan skin, braids. I'll start pounding on the door.

03:43:54.682 --> 03:44:02.222
MATT: Okay. A moment passes, and the door opens
up, and an elderly human woman comes to the door.

03:44:02.222 --> 03:44:08.315
Gray hair that goes past her shoulders. It's a
little wild and unkempt and wiry at the edges.

03:44:08.315 --> 03:44:15.295
There are wrinkles that scrunch the face in this
perpetual smile, and the eyes are almost beady

03:44:15.295 --> 03:44:22.455
behind the folded forehead and lids that have
fallen with time. "Hello? Can I help you?"

03:44:22.455 --> 03:44:26.173
SAM: Edith, it's me. Where's my son?

03:44:26.173 --> 03:44:31.026
MATT: "Ah, I thought you were dead."

03:44:31.026 --> 03:44:33.432
SAM: I'm not. Let me see him right now.

03:44:33.432 --> 03:44:48.029
MATT: "My goodness. Luke? Luke?" You see a small
halfling boy, maybe no more than five years old,

03:44:48.029 --> 03:44:57.284
peek around the doorway. Shaggy,
light brown hair, blue eyes. "Yeah?"

03:44:57.284 --> 03:45:05.078
SAM: (sniffles) Hi.

03:45:05.078 --> 03:45:11.937
MATT: "Daddy said the goblins killed you."

03:45:11.937 --> 03:45:21.070
SAM: No, they didn't. I'll pull out the
doll of King Bertrand and give it to him.

03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:32.856
I brought you that and other toys. How are you?
Are you okay? Did they hurt you?

03:45:32.856 --> 03:45:44.320
MATT: "Edith says Daddy went away to help the war,
but I think she's lying. He's probably dead too,

03:45:44.320 --> 03:45:46.418
"like I thought you were."

03:45:46.418 --> 03:45:51.851
SAM: No, no, no. He's alive. I know he is.
Did they touch you?

03:45:51.852 --> 03:45:57.077
MATT: "No. Daddy locks me away when
the mean lady comes by."

03:45:57.077 --> 03:46:06.350
SAM: The mean lady? What does she look like? Who
is she? Oh my gosh, it's so wonderful to see you.

03:46:06.351 --> 03:46:09.513
I pick him up and give him a big hug and a kiss.

03:46:09.513 --> 03:46:15.431
MATT: He stiffens up. He's overwhelmed
and untrusting of this scenario--

03:46:15.431 --> 03:46:16.958
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry.

03:46:16.958 --> 03:46:24.137
MATT: But you still pick him up. "The mean lady
with the pointy ears."

03:46:24.137 --> 03:46:29.462
SAM: Yes. She comes often?

03:46:29.462 --> 03:46:31.493
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

03:46:31.493 --> 03:46:35.110
SAM: You go somewhere safe when she comes?

03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:38.370
MATT: "Daddy would put me in my room."

03:46:38.370 --> 03:46:41.231
SAM: What about the last time?

03:46:41.231 --> 03:46:47.923
MATT: "That was the night when all
the loud noises happened."

03:46:47.924 --> 03:46:53.008
SAM: Yes?

03:46:53.008 --> 03:47:05.368
MATT: "Daddy pushed me out of the house and said
go, so I ran to Edith. Everything was on fire."

03:47:05.368 --> 03:47:14.113
SAM: Very smart. You're very smart. You've always
been a very smart boy. You're a good boy.

03:47:14.113 --> 03:47:22.276
Good job. Stay safe. When you were running away,
did you see anything of Dad?

03:47:22.276 --> 03:47:30.920
MATT: "No. It was just a lot of scary
people in armor."

03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:41.427
SAM: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I wasn't
there to protect you. I--

03:47:41.427 --> 03:47:46.506
MATT: "Mommy, where were you?"

03:47:46.506 --> 03:47:59.492
SAM: I was far away. I was trying to get back. I
was trying to come back, I was. I was trying so

03:47:59.493 --> 03:48:13.314
hard, but I don't have-- I'm not strong enough to
come back yet. (stutters) But know that I'm always

03:48:13.471 --> 03:48:21.070
thinking of you. I send you things so you remember
me, and I hope Dad gives them to you.

03:48:21.070 --> 03:48:34.663
MATT: "I get presents, but he just says
they're from somebody."

03:48:34.663 --> 03:48:45.730
SAM: Oh. Well, that's fine. Yeah, it would be hard
to understand, but I love you so much, and I've

03:48:45.900 --> 03:48:55.813
never stopped thinking about you and trying to
come home. I didn't want to go away. I'm going to

03:48:55.813 --> 03:49:07.361
find your father. I will, and then maybe we can be
a family again. Maybe-- I will find him. I promise

03:49:07.487 --> 03:49:13.967
you, all right? You just have to be that smart boy
that I know and stay safe, all right?

03:49:13.967 --> 03:49:16.026
MATT: "Is Daddy alive?"

03:49:16.026 --> 03:49:22.778
SAM: In my heart I think he is.

03:49:22.778 --> 03:49:27.173
MATT: "And you're alive again?"

03:49:27.173 --> 03:49:31.980
SAM: I will be, too.

03:49:31.980 --> 03:49:38.703
MATT: "Then don't die." He turns around
and walks back into the house.

03:49:38.703 --> 03:49:45.687
SAM: Thank you. Sorry, Edith.

03:49:45.687 --> 03:49:59.606
MATT: "I'm just happy to see you're okay. I'll
watch the boy. Is there anything I can do to...?

03:49:59.606 --> 03:50:02.115
"I'm real sorry."

03:50:02.115 --> 03:50:09.369
SAM: Do you have family somewhere else, somewhere
out of the city? Out of the village, I mean?

03:50:09.370 --> 03:50:13.997
MATT: "My husband passed away seven years ago,
and it's just been me."

03:50:13.997 --> 03:50:32.599
SAM: Ah. Is this--? I don't know. Are there
any strong-- How do I--?

03:50:32.599 --> 03:50:35.192
LAURA: You need somewhere--?

03:50:35.192 --> 03:50:37.020
SAM: To protect them.

03:50:37.020 --> 03:50:40.636
Travis: I think they got what they came for.
I think it's safe here now.

03:50:40.636 --> 03:50:51.225
SAM: You think? Here, here, take this.
I'll give her 200 gold. Use this to

03:50:51.225 --> 03:50:57.792
buy new locks, or a bigger door, or--

03:50:57.792 --> 03:51:03.733
TRAVIS: You could send them to Alfield if you
wanted. I'm sure Bryce could take care of them.

03:51:03.734 --> 03:51:06.097
SAM: What if the next attack is there?

03:51:06.097 --> 03:51:12.270
MARISHA: I agree with Fjord. I don't think they
necessarily found what they were looking for

03:51:12.270 --> 03:51:16.728
when they came here, but I think they
didn't find it and they might move on.

03:51:16.728 --> 03:51:22.111
SAM: So they'll be okay here?

03:51:22.111 --> 03:51:24.878
TRAVIS: If you don't feel comfortable here,
you should tell them--

03:51:24.878 --> 03:51:27.386
SAM: No. I don't know. I don't know.

03:51:27.386 --> 03:51:32.173
MARISHA: I'm making guesses like the
rest of us. None of us can honestly

03:51:32.173 --> 03:51:34.747
tell you what the right call is here.

03:51:34.747 --> 03:51:44.609
MATT: "Look, Veth, wherever you go, let me know
how I can help. If you need us to leave,

03:51:44.610 --> 03:51:48.699
"we'll leave. I mean, you've given me enough
to at least get out of town for a while."

03:51:48.699 --> 03:51:58.281
SAM: Okay, maybe lay low for a little while,
a few days, a few weeks, and then--

03:51:58.281 --> 03:52:00.234
MATT: "I can do that."

03:52:00.234 --> 03:52:02.703
LAURA: We can send a message anytime.

03:52:02.703 --> 03:52:08.896
SAM: Okay, yes. She can send you a magical
message, and you can tell us where you are.

03:52:08.897 --> 03:52:11.346
MATT: "Okay, I can do that."

03:52:11.346 --> 03:52:16.643
TRAVIS: Worst case scenario, they could go south.
You could send them to Nicodranas, I'm sure.

03:52:16.643 --> 03:52:19.468
LAURA: Yeah, my mama--

03:52:19.468 --> 03:52:21.679
SAM: I don't know if they would make that.
That's a long journey.

03:52:21.679 --> 03:52:25.207
TRAVIS: It is. I don't know how far or fast
this is moving.

03:52:25.207 --> 03:52:34.203
SAM: I don't either. I don't know.
I'm not thinking straight right now.

03:52:34.203 --> 03:52:38.254
MARISHA: I think we all need to talk.

03:52:38.255 --> 03:52:47.682
SAM: Okay. Stay here for now, and stay safe.
We'll come back soon. Thank you.

03:52:47.682 --> 03:52:52.680
MATT: "He's a good boy, Veth. You did good."

03:52:52.680 --> 03:52:54.209
SAM: "Yeah?"

03:52:54.209 --> 03:52:56.027
MATT: "Take care of yourself."

03:52:56.027 --> 03:52:57.503
SAM: All right.

03:52:57.503 --> 03:53:08.990
MATT: She closes the door. At that point,
back where you rode from, walking across

03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:13.571
the street are the two figures that you saw
when you first came towards the plaza.

03:53:13.571 --> 03:53:19.914
Walking and quietly talking to each other,
heading towards the rubble of the apothecary.

03:53:19.915 --> 03:53:22.078
TALIESIN: We're going to get in the cart
and move now.

03:53:22.078 --> 03:53:23.993
MATT: That's where we're going to
end tonight's episode.

03:53:24.401 --> 03:53:26.829
(groaning)

03:53:26.829 --> 03:53:28.628
MATT: Pick up next week.

03:53:28.629 --> 03:53:32.480
LAURA: You sneaky motherfucker!

03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:36.414
TALIESIN: I was looking forward to a
shopping episode. This was really good.

03:53:36.415 --> 03:53:37.889
MATT: It was!

03:53:37.889 --> 03:53:39.186
TALIESIN: This was good, guys.

03:53:39.186 --> 03:53:40.611
MATT: For a while.

03:53:40.612 --> 03:53:42.425
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, this was nice and gentle.

03:53:42.425 --> 03:53:44.326
MARISHA: Sam Riegel!

03:53:44.326 --> 03:53:48.513
TALIESIN: I was waiting for the Riegel shoe
to drop, man.

03:53:48.513 --> 03:53:52.019
(laughter)

03:53:52.019 --> 03:53:55.457
SAM: Oh, boy.

03:53:55.457 --> 03:53:58.031
LAURA: I can't wait to interrogate you.

03:53:58.031 --> 03:54:01.430
TALIESIN: Hey, we're going to use a chair!
That's so exciting!

03:54:01.430 --> 03:54:06.384
SAM: The chair is the key to everything.
It's the thread that holds it all together.

03:54:06.384 --> 03:54:08.906
TRAVIS: Why the chair, though?

03:54:08.906 --> 03:54:11.695
MATT: Hey, I mean, look at it this way. If you
guys had come here instead of Nicodranas,

03:54:11.695 --> 03:54:13.734
you would have been here when
all this went down.

03:54:13.734 --> 03:54:15.444
SAM: Oh, &lt;i&gt;fuck&lt;/i&gt;.

03:54:15.444 --> 03:54:24.136
TALIESIN: Wow, dude. Wow. As Beau might say, "Wow!
Wow."

03:54:24.137 --> 03:54:26.680
LIAM and TALIESIN: (shouting) Wow!

03:54:26.680 --> 03:54:29.204
LIAM: (shouting) Hey, Caleb!

03:54:29.204 --> 03:54:32.547
LIAM, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: (shouting) Wow!

03:54:32.548 --> 03:54:44.301
MATT: Anyway-- I know, RIP, ears at the
end of the episode.

03:54:44.442 --> 03:54:46.639
MARISHA: RIP, ears. Don't at me.

03:54:46.639 --> 03:54:49.702
MATT: Yep. All right, guys. We'll pick up here
next Thursday. It's going to be a hell of a week

03:54:49.702 --> 03:54:55.385
for all of us. We'll see some of you guys at the
art gallery this weekend. We'll see some of you

03:54:55.386 --> 03:54:58.967
guys at the live show on Saturday. Super excited
to have everyone step back into their

03:54:58.967 --> 03:55:03.673
Vox Machina shoes. We'll pick up at this
crazy point next Thursday.

03:55:03.673 --> 03:55:05.271
SAM: Oh, boy.

03:55:05.271 --> 03:55:09.037
MATT: We'll see you then. We love you very much.
Have a wonderful week, and is it Thursday yet?

03:55:09.037 --> 03:55:11.367
Good night.

03:55:11.367 --> 03:55:18.499

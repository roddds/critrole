00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.855
MATT: Hello everybody, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:09.308
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:10.504
(cheering)

00:00:10.504 --> 00:00:11.589
MATT: Now from our own studio!

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:12.500
TALIESIN: It's so weird!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.727
MATT: I know, not a whole lot has changed at the
moment. A few things, a few little bells and

00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:20.498
whistles here. But yeah, we're at our own place,
which is crazy.

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:22.164
TALIESIN: This is a crazy thing above us.

00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:22.682
MATT: I know.

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:28.009
LIAM: We're surrounded with people in white robes.
I don't know why.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.630
SAM: Just keep saying Fidelio.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.339
TALIESIN: Fidelio.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.628
MATT: Perfect. So welcome, glad you guys can join
us. Guys, still with the clap thing too much.

00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:41.746
Before we jump into tonight's game, let's get
through our announcements. First and foremost, our

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:45.923
fantastic sponsor for this evening, and has been
for quite some time, our friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond!

00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:47.460
SAM: D&amp;amp;D Beyond!

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.036
MATT: Sam, if you want to take that away.

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:55.603
SAM: Yes, D&amp;amp;D Beyond wanted to announce that their
826LA donation campaign has officially come to an

00:00:55.603 --> 00:01:05.138
end, and they've raised $11,400 for 826LA based on
114 natural ones rolled through the end of June.

00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:12.962
We are terrible, but our bad luck is the kids'
good fortune. The main thing that people have been

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:22.046
wondering and talking about on The Facebooks and
stuff is the new baby. Travis and Laura aren't

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:28.163
here, you guys might have noticed, and everyone's
like, "How was the birth? How did it all go down

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:35.263
"two Thursdays ago?" So I have taken a little
license, but I have scripted a bit of a radio play

00:01:35.263 --> 00:01:41.750
that we're all going to participate in to show our
viewers how it all went down two Thursdays ago,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.905
and how the birth came to be. Taliesin will be
narrating, I will be playing the role of Travis,

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:49.651
Marisha will be playing the role of Laura.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.688
MARISHA: Sorry, Laura.

00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:52.155
SAM: Liam will be the doctor.

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:53.479
LIAM: A real job, Dad!

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.287
SAM: And Matt will be a couple of different roles,
including Matt Mercer.

00:01:58.287 --> 00:02:00.212
MATT: Oh, I can probably do that.

00:02:00.212 --> 00:02:06.188
SAM: We're going to see what happens, this is a
first performance of its kind. Take it away, Taliesin.

00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:10.594
TALIESIN: Exactly two weeks ago, at the Willingham
house.

00:02:10.594 --> 00:02:17.517
SAM: Babe, can you bring me some onion rings and
Miller Ice with lime? The Cowboys game starts in

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.658
six weeks and I want to be ready.

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:27.464
MARISHA: Darling, something magical is happening.
Our boy, the magical light that will illuminate

00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:30.629
the universe, will join us soon.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.034
SAM: Huh, what?! Right now?! But the Cowboys!

00:02:33.034 --> 00:02:40.237
MARISHA: Travis, dear, your stallion is galloping
to earth, humanity must welcome him with loving arms.

00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:42.783
SAM: Ugh, I'll get the stupid hospital bag.

00:02:42.783 --> 00:02:45.304
TALIESIN: Later, in the hospital waiting room.

00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:49.330
SAM: Hey, Matt, heads up, Laura's having that
stupid baby.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.245
MATT: Oh yeah, no problem, I'll just throw out the
next three weeks of story I planned out and

00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:56.468
totally rework everything to accommodate this. I
don't need to sleep. Ever.

00:02:56.468 --> 00:03:00.382
SAM: Cool, bro. Hey, can you also tape the Dallas
Cowboys game for me?

00:03:00.382 --> 00:03:03.060
TALIESIN: Meanwhile, inside the delivery room.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.517
LIAM: Okay, Mrs. Willingham.

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.216
MARISHA: It's Bailey.

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:13.542
LIAM: Oh right, sorry. Anyway, I have checked your
charts and you should be in a lot of pain right now.

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:19.523
MARISHA: I feel nothing but the sweet nectar of
Mother Nature coursing through me. My love

00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:24.192
radiates like luminescent rainbows that will
create a new life this day.

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:28.517
LIAM: Really? Well, you should get ready for a
long labor, this one could take up to 36 hours--

00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:31.792
MATT: (infant crying)

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:33.345
MARISHA: It is done.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:36.465
(laughter)

00:03:36.465 --> 00:03:39.954
MARISHA: The mortal world has received its divine
cherub.

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:43.425
LIAM: What?! That's medically impossible! You
didn't even push!

00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:50.442
MARISHA: Does one need push for the summer to
shine down its radiance upon us? No, we merely

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:55.925
bask in its glory. Lo, my baby is perfection.

00:03:55.925 --> 00:04:02.762
MATT: Yes, I am perfection. Mother, I bring news
from the womb. The newly revamped digital

00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:34.152

00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:37.712
MARISHA: You are a miracle baby. I love you.

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.823
MATT: I love you, Mama Willingham.

00:04:39.823 --> 00:04:41.074
MARISHA: It's Bailey.

00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:42.909
TALIESIN: And scene.

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.735
SAM: Thank you guys, this was great. That was
theater!

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:48.380
MATT: And strangely accurate.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.299
MARISHA: That was handed to us two minutes ago.

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:52.850
SAM: You were fantastic as Laura Bailey.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.192
LIAM: It was like Travis was here!

00:04:55.192 --> 00:05:01.973
SAM: Yeah, my Travis is pretty good. Also from D&amp;amp;D
Beyond, next Wednesday, July 18 at 1:00 PM

00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:09.491
Pacific, &amp;amp; BEYOND, a new weekly stream hosted by
Adam Bradford and Todd Kenreck, kicks off with

00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:12.891
super-special guest Matthew Mercer.

00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:13.518
MATT: Yay!

00:05:13.518 --> 00:05:18.899
SAM: Did you know that? Okay, cool. Each week, the
show will cover not only D&amp;amp;D, but also the guest's

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:23.069
other passions outside of D&amp;amp;D, like D&amp;amp;D.

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.294
MATT: Maybe they shouldn't have started with me.

00:05:26.294 --> 00:05:32.866
SAM: Shenanigans will ensue, so don't miss it. Be
sure to check it out at Twitch.tv/dndbeyond to

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:34.855
watch. That's our sponsor shoutout.

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:40.369
MATT: Boom! Well done, Sam. Laura and Travis,
direct all that fury at Sam, please.

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:42.180
LIAM: Send your emails.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:50.025
MATT: Thank you, Sam. A couple of quick notes
here: we are headed to San Diego Comic-Con next

00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:54.340
week for our Critical Role panel and, as we
announced today, we're also going to New York

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.945
Comic-Con later this year. For details on either
of those events, go to Critrole.com for all the

00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:04.590
information. It's there for you. The "Nott the
Best Detective Agency" shirt is up in the store

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.372
right now. Once again, head to shop.critrole.com
to check it out. Our fantastic, terrible detectives.

00:06:11.372 --> 00:06:14.025
SAM: We'll see. Tonight.

00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:19.259
MATT: We'll see. Yeah. Starting this week, the
Wyrmwood giveaways are back for Critical Role

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.955
intermission. The giveaways will be hosted on the
Critical Role Twitch channel, however, and moving

00:06:23.955 --> 00:06:27.579
forward, so when we're coming to the break, if you
want to jump over to the Critical Role Twitch,

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:32.481
it's Twitch.tv/criticalrole. There, you can enter
the Wyrmwood giveaways. Keep an eye out for that

00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:36.250
and we'll remind you before we jump to the break
as well. You can watch our hosted stream and our

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.819
sweepstakes there, at that location. As a
reminder, Talks Machina, our after-discussion show

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.090
about whatever transpires here at this table, is
every Tuesday evening. The next episode will be

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.953
next Tuesday at 7:00 PM Pacific time, hosted by
our fantastic Brian W. Foster, if he can get away

00:06:52.953 --> 00:07:00.072
from Lancaster long enough. He'll be giving out
prizes for Gif of the Week, for Fanart of the

00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:07.054
Week, and all that fun stuff, so check it out on
Tuesday. Other than that, let's go ahead and jump

00:07:07.054 --> 00:07:12.334
in to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:07:12.334 --> 00:07:14.500
SAM: (baby-like wailing)

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.460
[click, TV static]

00:07:18.460 --> 00:08:35.731
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:37.764
MATT: And welcome back.

00:08:37.764 --> 00:08:47.836
SAM: Come in, Harry, come in. Take off your
robes.

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:55.679
MATT: So. Welcome back. Last we left off, The
Mighty Nein were making their way north after

00:08:55.777 --> 00:09:00.014
making a deal with the Gentleman in Zadash. They
had completed the first of two tasks for him, the

00:09:00.014 --> 00:09:05.671
second one requiring them to make their way to the
northern city of Shadycreek Run, outside of the

00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:10.182
Empire, to meet with a business operative of his,
who had been busy with some other elements and

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:16.948
needed some help to reconnect about what their
business together was. Along this journey, you had

00:09:16.948 --> 00:09:22.805
made a stop in the gnomish city of Hupperdook,
where you discovered the work-hard-play-hard

00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:29.723
gnomish society, got all your money taken from
you, got it returned to you as you found out the

00:09:29.723 --> 00:09:35.811
thieves were the young children of a family, the
parents of which had been arrested and had been

00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:41.532
imprisoned for a while. You went to the prison,
helped destroy one of their long-haywire

00:09:41.532 --> 00:09:47.992
guardians, and paid off the rest of the fine for
those parents, to set them free, returning them to

00:09:47.992 --> 00:09:53.577
their children, and decided to leave your
temporary companion for a while, Kiri, with them,

00:09:53.577 --> 00:09:59.463
as a safer means of continuing her journey, now
with her new family.

00:09:59.463 --> 00:10:05.447
With that, you gathered your things, found
yourself a better crossbow, and began heading back

00:10:05.447 --> 00:10:12.716
on the trail along the Crispvale Road and making
your way northward. There, you had set up camp for

00:10:12.716 --> 00:10:20.016
the evening about a day's travel outside of
Hupperdook, and during the night, while Yasha and

00:10:20.016 --> 00:10:25.545
Fjord were taking their watch, wakening Jester
with their conversation, and the three of them

00:10:25.545 --> 00:10:33.424
deciding to step away from the camp as not to wake
the rest of you, they were... Well, they went missing.

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:34.779
SAM: We don't know.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:44.088
MATT: We begin today's story as morning slowly
creeps over the distant mountains. The cold,

00:10:44.088 --> 00:10:50.302
frosted dew on the tops of the nearby grasses
glistening like tiny crystals, the bits of

00:10:50.302 --> 00:10:56.923
sunlight begin to just break past the ridge. The
sky, previously clear the night before showing the

00:10:56.923 --> 00:11:03.793
stars above, now is matted with cloud cover and
small breaks that show the blue sky above. The

00:11:03.793 --> 00:11:09.570
cold weather is definitely shaking you awake as
you all begin to come to, rubbing your eyes.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.569
Glancing about the cold atmosphere, you come to
the hard, dirt ground patch that you had cleared

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:24.726
out for your evening's rest, your packs and tents
ready to be reassembled... But it's just the four

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:25.167
of you.

00:11:30.677 --> 00:11:39.075
SAM: Jester, I need some pocket bacon for
breakfast. Jester? Jester-- oh, she's probably

00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:41.374
taking a dump in the woods.

00:11:41.374 --> 00:11:43.361
MARISHA: I think I have some pocket bacon still.

00:11:43.361 --> 00:11:44.494
SAM: Oh, can I have some?

00:11:44.494 --> 00:11:46.228
MARISHA: Yeah. It's a little moldy.

00:11:46.228 --> 00:11:51.430
SAM: Oh, that's even better. (eating noises)

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.157
MARISHA: Okay.

00:11:52.157 --> 00:11:54.829
TALIESIN: Fjord never came back after watch last
night.

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:57.099
LIAM: I stand up and scan the area.

00:11:57.099 --> 00:11:58.614
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:11:58.614 --> 00:12:06.341
LIAM: What is that? That's a six plus something.
Nine.

00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:14.807
MATT: Looking about, there is a faint mist that is
still burning off that clouds your vision far

00:12:14.807 --> 00:12:19.621
enough to the point where you can't quite see some
elements of the mountain range you had just come

00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:26.023
from, but glancing about around you, there's no
sign of your three companions. There's no visuals

00:12:26.023 --> 00:12:28.935
that guide you to where they might be.

00:12:28.935 --> 00:12:31.181
MARISHA: Where's Yasha? She's gone too.

00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:34.237
SAM: She does that sometimes. I'm sure it's
nothing.

00:12:34.237 --> 00:12:34.993
MARISHA: Yeah, but--

00:12:34.993 --> 00:12:35.746
TALIESIN: Fjord?

00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:39.226
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Jester?

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:41.340
TALIESIN: The Traveler's bullshit!

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.945
SAM: That's playing--

00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:44.257
TALIESIN: That really would've worked.

00:12:44.257 --> 00:12:46.006
SAM: That's playing with fire.

00:12:46.006 --> 00:12:54.963
TALIESIN: I'm going to check the tents. I'm going
to check the tents to see if their stuff is still there.

00:12:54.975 --> 00:13:02.871
MATT: As you go about to their sleeping
arrangement spaces, everything except for whatever

00:13:02.871 --> 00:13:09.791
they had on them as they took their watch is still
there. The haversack is left behind, the rest of

00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:12.678
their goods lying on the ground where they were
left.

00:13:12.678 --> 00:13:14.417
SAM: Their personal belongings and stuff?

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:14.915
MATT: Yep.

00:13:14.915 --> 00:13:15.753
MARISHA: Falchion?

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:19.015
MATT: The falchion's always with him.

00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:25.433
MARISHA: Right, but his holster thingy. Right?
Didn't he have a holster thing, or did I just

00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:27.443
imagine that because he's Texblade?

00:13:27.443 --> 00:13:33.580
MATT: He would have a belt with pouches and such,
but no, that was on him at the time.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.747
SAM: His spats and spurs?

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.359
MATT: Those are not there, unfortunately.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:37.953
SAM: Oh, wow.

00:13:37.953 --> 00:13:45.549
MATT: Essentially, everything but the equipment
they had on them-- in fact, if you look, you can

00:13:45.549 --> 00:13:51.050
see Jester's shield is there, currently
untouched.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.951
MARISHA: It's not right.

00:13:51.951 --> 00:13:53.222
TALIESIN: Yasha's stuff is still here?

00:13:53.222 --> 00:13:57.667
MATT: Yasha doesn't have much on her. Whatever she
does have, she generally keeps on her, so she

00:13:57.667 --> 00:13:58.828
hasn't left anything behind.

00:13:58.828 --> 00:13:59.934
TALIESIN: So there's nothing behind?

00:13:59.934 --> 00:14:01.156
LIAM: Are their weapons here?

00:14:01.156 --> 00:14:06.804
MATT: You don't see any weapons. Yasha keeps her
weapon on her at all times; Fjord, from what you

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:14.454
understand, weirdly never seems to have need. But
Jester's weapon is left next to the shield as well

00:14:14.454 --> 00:14:15.826
as you begin to rummage through.

00:14:15.826 --> 00:14:21.312
SAM: I'll take a swig to calm my morning nerves
and start searching around to see if there's any

00:14:21.312 --> 00:14:23.920
notes or any signs of anything around.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.182
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:14:25.182 --> 00:14:27.036
SAM: Okay. That's terrible.

00:14:27.036 --> 00:14:28.638
TALIESIN: That's unbelievably bad.

00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:30.376
SAM: That's an eight.

00:14:30.376 --> 00:14:38.595
MATT: All right then. As you begin to rummage
around in the nearby grasses, tossing over the

00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:44.682
remains of their left behind materials, even
pushing through the fire just in case some of them

00:14:44.682 --> 00:14:46.948
may have fallen in, no sign.

00:14:46.948 --> 00:14:52.881
TALIESIN: I'm going to check the road for fresh
tracks, see if anything looks like it was disturbed.

00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:54.060
MATT: You'd make an investigation check then.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.333
MARISHA: Are there trees nearby?

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:57.818
MATT: Not within the next mile or so.

00:14:57.818 --> 00:15:01.060
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake. Same roll. Two.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:01.682
MATT: Okay.

00:15:01.682 --> 00:15:12.425
LIAM: I am going to sit down and bring Frumpkin
out, and pull out my book and begin to do what's

00:15:12.425 --> 00:15:20.424
needed to cast it again-- Find Familiar-- but I'm
going to turn Frumpkin into, uh... a peregrine falcon.

00:15:20.424 --> 00:15:21.381
MATT: Okay.

00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:22.066
SAM: Whoa.

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:26.095
MARISHA: That was very specific for an "uh" to
come before it.

00:15:26.095 --> 00:15:31.501
MATT: (laughs) So, as you are both losing
yourselves amongst the nearby grasses, and trying

00:15:31.501 --> 00:15:35.467
to look for any sign of where they may have been,
you are focusing on your spell. What are you

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:36.589
doing, Beauregard?

00:15:36.589 --> 00:15:42.197
MARISHA: Can I see if I see any grass that's been
laid down, like a direction that there might be

00:15:42.197 --> 00:15:43.674
people who have walked through?

00:15:43.674 --> 00:15:45.628
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

00:15:45.628 --> 00:15:51.935
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

00:15:51.935 --> 00:15:54.418
SAM: Oh my god, we're not even going to know
they're gone.

00:15:54.418 --> 00:15:57.521
(laughter)

00:15:57.521 --> 00:15:59.603
TALIESIN: They're literally scarecrows in the
background.

00:15:59.603 --> 00:16:01.609
LIAM: They're probably skinny dipping somewhere!

00:16:01.609 --> 00:16:04.949
MATT: This is amazing.

00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:08.297
SAM: We got a two, a two, a one. What was your
first roll?

00:16:08.297 --> 00:16:10.172
LIAM: I rolled a six, which turned into a nine.

00:16:10.172 --> 00:16:12.071
SAM: Okay, so six is our top roll so far.

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:14.959
MATT: Knocking it out of the park, y'all.

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:20.533
TALIESIN: We are children lost at a Ross Dress for
Less. We're never going to see our parents again.

00:16:20.533 --> 00:16:21.593
It's all over.

00:16:21.593 --> 00:16:23.535
MARISHA: First roll in the new studio, it's a
one!

00:16:23.535 --> 00:16:29.253
MATT: We'll get them out now! In the time that you
guys have begun to shout, you're continuing to

00:16:29.253 --> 00:16:33.912
shout their names out, and forge through the
nearby grasses. Caleb, you complete your spell,

00:16:33.912 --> 00:16:39.815
and Frumpkin's form suddenly, slowly shifts, then,
with a puff of steam and smoke, turns into the

00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:46.570
falcon. Lands on your shoulder. (caws)

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:53.880
LIAM: I know, I am sorry. I will change you back
as fast as I can. I need you to look for the three

00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:00.245
that you do not see here. The green one, the blue
one, and the goth one. Go!

00:17:00.245 --> 00:17:06.018
MATT: You watch as Frumpkin takes off into the sky
and does a few loops. Go ahead and make a

00:17:06.018 --> 00:17:09.755
perception check from a bird's eye view, which
makes it a little easier.

00:17:09.755 --> 00:17:11.929
TALIESIN: (cawing)

00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:14.442
LIAM: Natural 20.

00:17:14.442 --> 00:17:16.075
TALIESIN: Hey! Thank God.

00:17:16.075 --> 00:17:21.727
MATT: There you go! When humanity fails, bring in
the hawks.

00:17:21.727 --> 00:17:24.335
MARISHA: We know nature is better at everything.

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:30.165
MATT: With a quick, singular pass overhead, you
watch as Frumpkin sends you an immediate bit of

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:35.180
information. You focus through the eyes, and
glancing down, you see a clearing where a large

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:41.059
portion of grass, maybe about 60 or so feet from
where you guys are, has been pushed down. And you

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:44.409
see tracks and drag marks and grooves in the dirt.

00:17:44.409 --> 00:17:54.577
LIAM: Oh shit. There was a-- This way! I come out
of it so I don't trip on rocks. There's a struggle

00:17:54.577 --> 00:17:57.588
this way. And I lead the group back to this.

00:17:57.588 --> 00:18:02.288
MATT: All right. You guys rush over, and there you
can see on the ground this patch of disturbed

00:18:02.565 --> 00:18:08.199
grass that has been pushed down, along with the
dirt that has been jammed and shoved up into small

00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:13.921
side piles and trenches that were dug in. There's
definitely signs of a struggle here. At a quick

00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:20.184
glance, looking around, footprints and signs,
there looks to be somewhere between five to eight

00:18:20.184 --> 00:18:27.022
sets of footprints you can see from all different
angles. And you can see three grooves being

00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:31.216
dragged through the dirt into the grass, towards
the road a little bit northward.

00:18:31.216 --> 00:18:35.178
SAM: Can we follow those grooves?

00:18:35.178 --> 00:18:40.850
MATT: Yeah. You guys go ahead and follow these the
best you can, eventually making your way to the

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:47.684
outer side of the Crispvale Road, the path that
you were on already, but a little ways north of

00:18:47.684 --> 00:18:55.550
where you were. And there you can see the grooves
end, and a number of sets of heavy wagon wheels

00:18:55.550 --> 00:19:02.041
begin, or at least have previously pulled off the
trail and then pushed themselves back onto the road.

00:19:02.528 --> 00:19:06.378
MARISHA: So it's impossible to tell if it's the
same one?

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:11.589
SAM: Can we see which direction those wagon tracks
went in?

00:19:11.589 --> 00:19:20.742
MATT: It's hard to tell which direction wagon
tracks go in, necessarily. Make a survival check.

00:19:20.742 --> 00:19:23.787
SAM: Survival. Nine.

00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:30.066
MATT: (laughs) Could be going north. Could be
going south. You're not entirely sure.

00:19:30.445 --> 00:19:32.374
SAM: That narrows it down! It's not east or west,
guys!

00:19:32.374 --> 00:19:35.114
MATT: Northeast or southwest.

00:19:35.114 --> 00:19:35.863
SAM: God damn it!

00:19:35.863 --> 00:19:45.872
MARISHA: Well, that's more narrow. When it was
going on the road, was it going towards the

00:19:45.872 --> 00:19:49.233
direction we were going, or were we following it?

00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:54.622
MATT: You're not entirely certain. The tracks seem
to be traveling either in the northeast direction

00:19:54.622 --> 00:19:59.520
that the road goes that you were traveling, or
heading back towards Hupperdook. What you do

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.470
notice, though, and what keys you in that this has
something to do with this, is the tracks grind off

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:15.326
the road by about five or ten feet, and that's
where the grooves of these dragged individuals or

00:20:15.326 --> 00:20:19.972
sacks stop. And then it pushes back onto the
road.

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:35.155
LIAM: Here is what I am wondering: why we are
still here. Yasha and Jester and Fjord, they

00:20:35.155 --> 00:20:37.185
didn't know each other before a month ago.

00:20:37.185 --> 00:20:41.955
SAM: Who was on watch? It was Fjord and Yasha,
right?

00:20:41.955 --> 00:20:42.443
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:20:42.443 --> 00:20:47.099
SAM: So they would have been awake. But what about
Jester? She was asleep, right?

00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:50.809
MARISHA: She also has a big old crushie on Fjord.

00:20:50.809 --> 00:20:59.341
LIAM: If they were taken, that means they came to
our camp and took her, possibly. And even if they

00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:01.174
did not, it's not like we were hiding.

00:21:01.174 --> 00:21:02.804
MARISHA: Why couldn't we hear anything?

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:10.389
SAM: Maybe they weren't targeting anyone specific,
just coming to grab folks, and those were the ones

00:21:10.389 --> 00:21:12.652
that were awake, or closest to the road, or--

00:21:12.652 --> 00:21:16.136
LIAM: You'd take the three beefiest of a group of
strangers?

00:21:16.136 --> 00:21:19.516
SAM: Well, they took the three ugliest ones. I
mean, they left us.

00:21:19.516 --> 00:21:25.995
TALIESIN: First, thank you. Second, they may have
just taken the ones that were furthest away from

00:21:25.995 --> 00:21:31.029
the light. They just picked them off, maybe? You
walk away from camp, that's what happens. I mean,

00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:32.588
it's not the biggest or strongest. It's the--

00:21:32.588 --> 00:21:40.250
SAM: Wait. I'm going to examine the tracks for
blood.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.002
MATT: Make another investigation check.

00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:46.147
SAM: Mmm. That's an 11.

00:21:46.147 --> 00:21:56.134
MATT: It's better. In looking through near where
these cart tracks begin, there's no signs of

00:21:56.134 --> 00:22:01.091
blood. Going back and following the grooves
through the dirt, you find a few small traces.

00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:06.116
SAM: Anything weird about the blood? Is it green
blood, purple blood, blue blood?

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:10.858
MATT: No, just standard dark, dusted-over blood at
this point.

00:22:10.858 --> 00:22:12.297
MARISHA: Censored video game blood.

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:18.458
SAM: That means that they weren't bleeding when
they were dragged, which means that either they

00:22:18.458 --> 00:22:24.125
were killed by vampires and all their blood was
sucked out of them first, or they were still alive.

00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:32.271
MARISHA: And that blood was far away from our
camp. Maybe they were just triggered by a sound

00:22:32.271 --> 00:22:34.215
that they heard, and they went to go investigate
it.

00:22:34.215 --> 00:22:36.978
TALIESIN: I'm going to freak out. Is there any
trash or anything on the road? I'm just going to

00:22:36.978 --> 00:22:37.653
look for any--

00:22:37.653 --> 00:22:38.889
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:22:38.889 --> 00:22:44.231
TALIESIN: That's better. 14.

00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:50.533
MATT: 14? As you look off, looking for any sign of
change, there's the fog at the far peripheral of

00:22:50.533 --> 00:22:56.139
where you're watching. Nothing on the road, except
for a couple of tufts of scrub brush, catch your

00:22:56.139 --> 00:23:01.265
eyes, until you see a dark shape on the road to
the south.

00:23:01.265 --> 00:23:02.456
TALIESIN: Moving?

00:23:02.456 --> 00:23:09.049
MATT: Moving. It looks to be a shadowed outline of
a person.

00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:12.846
TALIESIN: I'm going to draw both swords and head
towards it.

00:23:12.846 --> 00:23:20.441
SAM: Seeing that, I will draw my new crossbow.
Turn it on. I imagine it's battery-powered.

00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:22.513
(powering-up noise)

00:23:22.513 --> 00:23:23.876
(laughter)

00:23:23.876 --> 00:23:26.143
MARISHA: Four D batteries. It's very obnoxious.

00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:28.108
MATT: They run out in half an hour. It's like a
Game Gear.

00:23:28.108 --> 00:23:31.065
LIAM: Do you want my not-cat to go look first?

00:23:31.065 --> 00:23:34.248
TALIESIN: I may have already moved. I didn't think
of that.

00:23:34.248 --> 00:23:35.329
MATT: I think Molly's already off.

00:23:35.329 --> 00:23:42.161
MARISHA: I'm following Molly. As I follow Molly, I
turn to Nott and Caleb, and I say, just stay back

00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:44.559
for a second. Back us up if we need it.

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:45.041
SAM: Sure.

00:23:45.041 --> 00:23:52.223
MATT: So you've nocked your bolt into your
crossbow for the first time. As it winds back, you

00:23:52.223 --> 00:23:58.084
crank it, and it slips into place. You hear this
faint spring tension.

00:23:58.084 --> 00:24:00.165
SAM: Ooh!

00:24:00.165 --> 00:24:05.138
MATT: As you're preparing for this, Molly and Beau
start rushing up.

00:24:05.138 --> 00:24:08.751
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm just going to be obvious.

00:24:08.751 --> 00:24:09.519
MARISHA: I flank.

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:12.082
MATT: Okay, so you head off into the brush?

00:24:12.082 --> 00:24:12.662
MARISHA: Stealth.

00:24:12.662 --> 00:24:13.957
MATT: Make a stealth check.

00:24:13.957 --> 00:24:15.748
LIAM: I send Frumpkin to do a lazy circle.

00:24:15.748 --> 00:24:21.974
MARISHA: Man. This feels like last game. 12.

00:24:21.974 --> 00:24:28.184
MATT: 12, okay. Good to know. Molly, as you get
closer, the shape takes more form. As the mist

00:24:28.184 --> 00:24:38.536
fades and your proximity grows closer, you see a
squat figure. Wide and muscular, armored, with a

00:24:38.536 --> 00:24:41.110
sack over the shoulder. Ashly, if you want to
enter?

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.687
SAM: What?! Whoa!

00:24:43.687 --> 00:24:44.993
TALIESIN: That was fast.

00:24:44.993 --> 00:24:46.742
LIAM: This is Your Life!

00:24:46.742 --> 00:24:49.764
MATT: Ashly Burch joins us at the table.

00:24:49.764 --> 00:24:53.458
LIAM: Hey, Ashly. Welcome.

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:57.536
MATT: So Ashly, if you'd like to describe what
Molly sees as he approaches?

00:24:57.536 --> 00:25:08.869
ASHLY: What Molly sees is a dwarven woman with a
five o'clock shadow, a cigarette hanging out of

00:25:08.869 --> 00:25:20.613
her mouth, extremely battered, bloodied, rusted
armor, full armor, and short, greasy hair. And she

00:25:20.613 --> 00:25:30.060
has a big ol' axe in one hand, and a big ol'
hammer in the other. Does she see these folk now?

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.769
MATT: Roll a perception check for me.

00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:33.805
ASHLY: I don't have dice.

00:25:33.805 --> 00:25:35.273
MATT: Oh! We should get that for you.

00:25:35.273 --> 00:25:36.890
SAM: How? This is terrible, here.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.395
LIAM: The Laura Bailey bladder was right here.
Where'd it go?

00:25:39.395 --> 00:25:41.705
MARISHA: Yeah, do you want--? Pick a dice bag.

00:25:41.705 --> 00:25:43.129
MATT: We got plenty.

00:25:43.129 --> 00:25:44.809
TALIESIN: And here, have a thing.

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:50.712
ASHLY: Oh, hey, thanks guys! It's like I'm part of
the crew. Okay. So I'm rolling perception?

00:25:50.712 --> 00:25:52.966
MATT: Yes. So roll a d20, add your perception
modifier.

00:25:52.966 --> 00:25:53.478
ASHLY: Okay.

00:25:53.478 --> 00:25:56.002
SAM: So much better than us.

00:25:56.002 --> 00:25:58.359
ASHLY: It's 18.

00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:06.351
MATT: So you see one figure coming towards you,
difficult to make out gender, of lavender skin,

00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:11.398
curled horns filled with jewelry, big long coat of
multi-colors, maroon, but then it goes into a

00:26:11.398 --> 00:26:18.299
rainbow pattern almost, with two glowing scimitars
to each side, staring you down. Behind that, you

00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:22.447
see two figures a little bit beyond your sight to
make out all the details, but one seems to be a

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:27.586
tall humanoid, the other seems to be much shorter
and smaller, probably halfling, gnome. And then

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:32.892
off in the bushes, not hiding very well, you see
another figure, keeping low to your left.

00:26:32.892 --> 00:26:38.517
ASHLY: Ah, son of a dick. All right, let's get
this over with. And then she holds up her

00:26:38.517 --> 00:26:40.414
battleaxe and her warhammer.

00:26:40.414 --> 00:26:41.248
SAM: Oh, she's challenging us.

00:26:41.248 --> 00:26:46.585
MARISHA: As I make eye-contact, I'm like, Aw,
shit. Was it the blue? Was I too tall?

00:26:46.585 --> 00:26:51.518
ASHLY: I mean, you guys have your weapons drawn.
I'm assuming-- Are we going to do this or what?

00:26:51.518 --> 00:26:55.363
MARISHA: I would just like a little bit of
feedback so I know how to perfect it later.

00:26:55.363 --> 00:26:57.523
ASHLY: Are you asking about your hiding?

00:26:57.523 --> 00:26:58.012
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:26:58.012 --> 00:27:00.152
ASHLY: It's shit, man. You gotta choose a new--

00:27:00.152 --> 00:27:01.222
MARISHA: Fuck. All right.

00:27:01.222 --> 00:27:04.290
ASHLY: I saw you. I thought you weren't trying
to hide.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.591
MARISHA: You've got great eyesight.

00:27:05.591 --> 00:27:06.335
ASHLY: Not really.

00:27:06.335 --> 00:27:08.137
MARISHA: I'm complimenting you.

00:27:08.137 --> 00:27:09.784
TALIESIN: What the fuck is going on?

00:27:09.784 --> 00:27:11.156
MARISHA: What's your name?

00:27:11.156 --> 00:27:12.275
LIAM: Through the wire I whisper--

00:27:12.275 --> 00:27:14.781
ASHLY: What's your fucking name? You guys got
weapons out. What's going on?

00:27:14.781 --> 00:27:15.899
MARISHA: What's your fucking name?!

00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:17.063
ASHLY: What's your fucking name?!

00:27:17.063 --> 00:27:18.920
LIAM: I put the wire away.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.538
(laughter)

00:27:20.538 --> 00:27:21.761
SAM: What's going on up there?!

00:27:21.761 --> 00:27:22.253
TALIESIN: We don't know!

00:27:22.253 --> 00:27:23.817
SAM: Should I kill something?

00:27:23.817 --> 00:27:24.324
TALIESIN: Probably!

00:27:24.324 --> 00:27:28.733
ASHLY: I got a place to be, so if we could move
this along. Are we fighting or not?

00:27:28.733 --> 00:27:30.909
MARISHA: Molly, ask her. We're at an impasse.

00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:35.796
TALIESIN: I haven't really thought this through.
Where did you come from? What are you doing in the

00:27:35.796 --> 00:27:37.690
bloody bushes by our campsite?

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:44.304
ASHLY: I was walking up the road, man. I didn't
expect to see a bunch of poorly hidden weirdos

00:27:44.304 --> 00:27:45.679
with fucking weapons drawn.

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:48.025
LIAM: (shouts) Just make conversation.

00:27:48.025 --> 00:27:50.112
MARISHA: How's your day?

00:27:50.112 --> 00:27:53.606
(laughter)

00:27:53.606 --> 00:27:54.255
ASHLY: Weird now!

00:27:54.255 --> 00:27:58.513
MARISHA: Sorry. Happens sometimes.

00:27:58.513 --> 00:28:05.369
ASHLY: Wait, where are you guys from? Are you from
the Run?

00:28:05.369 --> 00:28:11.701
MARISHA: What's the Run? No, really, what's the
Run? That sounds fascinating.

00:28:11.701 --> 00:28:12.553
ASHLY: So you're not from the Run.

00:28:12.553 --> 00:28:14.460
SAM: (shouts) I think she means Shadycreek Run.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.528
ASHLY: Yeah, that.

00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:23.148
MARISHA: Oh, shit. We should have thought about
that. I don't know your street lingo.

00:28:23.148 --> 00:28:26.064
ASHLY: It's just a shortened version of the name.

00:28:26.064 --> 00:28:27.393
MARISHA: Yeah, you're right again.

00:28:27.393 --> 00:28:31.240
TALIESIN: I'm putting down one of the swords.
We're having a very weird day.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:31.604
SAM: Just one?

00:28:31.604 --> 00:28:34.244
TALIESIN: Just one. There's still one glowing
sword.

00:28:34.244 --> 00:28:35.751
ASHLY: Here, I'll put away the hammer.

00:28:35.751 --> 00:28:37.450
(laughter)

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.028
MATT: The de-escalation has begun.

00:28:39.028 --> 00:28:43.946
TALIESIN: We more or less got robbed last night
and you're the first living human being that we've

00:28:43.946 --> 00:28:45.393
seen-- or, not human being.

00:28:45.393 --> 00:28:46.063
ASHLY: Dwarf.

00:28:46.063 --> 00:28:51.794
MARISHA: And by "robbed," he means half of our
party got abducted. "Robbed?" That's such a light

00:28:51.794 --> 00:28:52.901
way of putting it.

00:28:52.901 --> 00:28:55.244
ASHLY: Whoa! Your party got abducted? When?

00:28:55.244 --> 00:28:56.852
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Last night.

00:28:56.852 --> 00:28:59.496
ASHLY: Son of a bitch. Yeah, okay.

00:28:59.496 --> 00:29:03.682
MARISHA: We were actually headed to the Run. It
does sound pretty cool.

00:29:03.682 --> 00:29:05.651
ASHLY: All right.

00:29:05.651 --> 00:29:08.162
SAM: I'm going to walk up next to Molly.

00:29:08.162 --> 00:29:10.180
MARISHA: (shouts) Yeah, hey, Caleb! Nott!

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:18.384
MATT: This tiny figure, hooded, with wrappings,
and a creepy porcelain doll face that covers--

00:29:18.384 --> 00:29:20.012
ASHLY: All right, I pull my hammer back out.

00:29:20.012 --> 00:29:21.147
SAM: Should I kill her?

00:29:21.147 --> 00:29:23.713
TALIESIN: Not yet. But keep it drawn.

00:29:23.713 --> 00:29:31.022
ASHLY: So all you guys are trying to do right now
is to try to get these people back that got got?

00:29:31.022 --> 00:29:32.117
Is that right?

00:29:32.117 --> 00:29:33.934
LIAM: (shouts) They have great sentimental value!

00:29:33.934 --> 00:29:36.131
SAM: You can come up now, Caleb.

00:29:36.131 --> 00:29:37.404
LIAM: (shouts) No, I'm good!

00:29:37.404 --> 00:29:44.900
TALIESIN: We're having a very bad morning. I
apologize if we came off a little terse. All

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:45.604
right, fine.

00:29:45.604 --> 00:29:51.147
MARISHA: We're a little on edge, considering
family-- I mean, party members-- were abducted.

00:29:51.147 --> 00:29:54.385
ASHLY: All right, I got a question. Does anyone
have booze?

00:29:54.385 --> 00:29:57.124
SAM: (smug giggling)

00:29:57.124 --> 00:29:57.751
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:29:57.751 --> 00:29:58.426
SAM: Why?

00:29:58.426 --> 00:30:04.054
ASHLY: Because I'm more partial to talking... I'm
out. My flask is done.

00:30:04.054 --> 00:30:07.302
SAM: Oh, your flask runs out?

00:30:07.302 --> 00:30:10.878
ASHLY: Yes, weird creepy doll girl!

00:30:10.878 --> 00:30:14.293
SAM: (smug giggling)

00:30:14.293 --> 00:30:18.162
ASHLY: Can anyone explain this shit to me? The
fuck is happening right now?

00:30:18.162 --> 00:30:18.582
SAM: Sorry.

00:30:18.582 --> 00:30:19.343
LIAM: (calling) It's complicated!

00:30:19.343 --> 00:30:22.540
ASHLY: Can you come out of the bush?! Please?!

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.953
SAM: He's very weak.

00:30:23.953 --> 00:30:26.678
(laughter)

00:30:26.678 --> 00:30:28.645
LIAM: Frumpkin lands on Nott's shoulder.

00:30:28.645 --> 00:30:30.708
MATT: A giant falcon (caw) lands.

00:30:30.708 --> 00:30:31.281
ASHLY: Ah!

00:30:31.281 --> 00:30:34.772
SAM: Don't worry. It's a cat, usually.

00:30:34.772 --> 00:30:35.288
ASHLY: What?!

00:30:35.288 --> 00:30:45.210
TALIESIN: I have an idea. We've all had a bit of a
morning. Let's sit down. Have a drink. We can get

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:53.185
you liquor. We can talk about anything you've seen
traveling on the road in the last day or two.

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:54.734
ASHLY: What's your name? I like you.

00:30:54.734 --> 00:30:55.738
TALIESIN: I'm Molly.

00:30:55.738 --> 00:30:57.311
ASHLY: Pleasure.

00:30:57.311 --> 00:30:59.810
TALIESIN: Is your name Pleasure, then?

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:00.449
ASHLY: No.

00:31:00.449 --> 00:31:02.617
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. That would've been very
inconvenient parenting.

00:31:02.617 --> 00:31:05.916
ASHLY: I'm trying this thing where I'm trying to
be more polite, and people say shit like that I guess.

00:31:05.916 --> 00:31:06.816
TALIESIN: There's weird parents that do things.

00:31:06.816 --> 00:31:07.241
ASHLY: My name's Keg.

00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:07.844
SAM: Ooh!

00:31:07.844 --> 00:31:09.387
ASHLY: As in powder or booze.

00:31:09.387 --> 00:31:11.255
TALIESIN: Never mind. They're very weird parents.

00:31:11.255 --> 00:31:15.757
SAM: I like you already. Here, do you have a cup
or something I could pour into?

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:17.016
ASHLY: Yeah, I got a flask.

00:31:17.016 --> 00:31:17.666
TALIESIN: Let's sit.

00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:22.853
SAM: All right, I'm going to take out my flask and
pour a good, healthy, half quantity. You have to

00:31:22.853 --> 00:31:25.356
drink it fast. It will disappear soon.

00:31:25.356 --> 00:31:26.503
ASHLY: What?

00:31:26.503 --> 00:31:27.351
TALIESIN: Is that true?

00:31:27.351 --> 00:31:27.984
SAM: Yes.

00:31:27.984 --> 00:31:30.671
ASHLY: What the fuck is with you people? All
right, Keg knocks it back.

00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:32.577
MATT: It's harsh but functional.

00:31:32.577 --> 00:31:37.661
ASHLY: Okay. I know who took your friends.

00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:45.679
SAM: What? I am the greatest detective of all
times! I poured one drink, and I solved the case!

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:50.343
(laughter)

00:31:50.343 --> 00:31:58.601
ASHLY: I know who took your friends. They're not
nice people, as you may have gathered. Good thing

00:31:58.601 --> 00:32:01.486
you were heading to Shadycreek Run because that's
where they operate out of.

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.084
SAM: How do you know? Who are they?

00:32:03.084 --> 00:32:07.149
ASHLY: I know. Okay? I know. I'm looking for them
too.

00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:09.251
SAM: Did you lose someone?

00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:11.115
ASHLY: (quietly) Yeah.

00:32:11.115 --> 00:32:15.632
MARISHA: Wait, I thought you were coming from
Shadycreek Run.

00:32:15.632 --> 00:32:17.759
ASHLY: No. I ain't been there in a while.

00:32:17.759 --> 00:32:20.174
MARISHA: Ah. But you've been there.

00:32:20.174 --> 00:32:29.213
ASHLY: Yeah, I've been there. I know it pretty
well. It ain't a nice place. It's probably the

00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:32.291
least nice place that you could all possibly go
to, so--

00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:33.643
MARISHA: It's named Shady.

00:32:33.643 --> 00:32:35.523
ASHLY: Shady. Aptly named.

00:32:35.523 --> 00:32:37.410
TALIESIN: Well we're not necessarily nice people,
so that'll work out fine.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.753
LIAM: We are well traveled.

00:32:38.753 --> 00:32:44.857
ASHLY: Okay. Are you tough? Because you don't look
it.

00:32:44.857 --> 00:32:46.090
SAM: (weak growl)

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:46.755
TALIESIN: We're not.

00:32:46.755 --> 00:32:48.409
ASHLY: Was I supposed to be scared?

00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:52.404
SAM: Oh, I should take off the mask. It's more
scary that way. (growl)

00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:54.301
ASHLY: Ah! Okay, yeah, that works.

00:32:54.301 --> 00:32:57.649
MARISHA: Molly doesn't speak for me. I feel like I
can hold my own pretty well.

00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:58.759
LIAM: Yeah, she's all right.

00:32:58.759 --> 00:33:03.136
MARISHA: I might actually be the only tough one
here. Shit.

00:33:03.136 --> 00:33:08.554
ASHLY: That's not great to hear. Okay. How much do
these people mean to you?

00:33:08.554 --> 00:33:15.012
MARISHA: Well, they're the only people I've had in
my life since my father, so. Parents.

00:33:15.012 --> 00:33:19.261
TALIESIN: We don't leave people behind, and that's
the deal.

00:33:19.261 --> 00:33:23.166
ASHLY: All right. What are your names?

00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:24.710
MARISHA: Plus, we had to go up there anyway.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:25.692
ASHLY: So it's Molly--

00:33:25.692 --> 00:33:26.437
TALIESIN: Molly, pleasure.

00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:28.389
ASHLY: What's the creepy little one?

00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:29.876
SAM: (stuttering) Jeff.

00:33:29.876 --> 00:33:30.657
TALIESIN: Nott.

00:33:30.657 --> 00:33:32.497
ASHLY: Thank you, Molly.

00:33:32.497 --> 00:33:33.740
SAM: It's Nott.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.891
ASHLY: You're going to be a fucking piece of work.
What's your name?

00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:37.669
MARISHA: Beau.

00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:39.965
ASHLY: Beau. And Bush Man?

00:33:39.965 --> 00:33:41.545
LIAM: Ah, I like that.

00:33:41.545 --> 00:33:44.016
ASHLY: All right, Bush Man. Okay.

00:33:44.016 --> 00:33:47.992
LIAM: My name is Caleb, but you could still call
me Bush Man.

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:49.508
ASHLY: Do you prefer Bush Man?

00:33:49.508 --> 00:33:51.047
LIAM: Well, let's think about it.

00:33:51.047 --> 00:33:57.581
SAM: Herr Bush. Why don't you come back to our
camp?

00:33:57.581 --> 00:33:59.301
ASHLY: Ain't I at your camp?

00:33:59.301 --> 00:34:00.756
TALIESIN: We are at the camp right now.

00:34:00.756 --> 00:34:03.131
SAM: No, aren't we in the road? Oh, did we come
back?

00:34:03.131 --> 00:34:03.662
LIAM: Yeah.

00:34:03.662 --> 00:34:05.312
MATT: Walked over as you poured the drink.

00:34:05.312 --> 00:34:06.519
SAM: Oh, okay. Cool.

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:09.183
TALIESIN: I'm going to nervously pack while this
is going on.

00:34:09.183 --> 00:34:10.843
LIAM: Yeah, I'm scooping up the haversack.

00:34:10.843 --> 00:34:16.338
ASHLY: So here's the deal. Shadycreek Run is full
of a bunch of shitty lowlifes. They're all

00:34:16.338 --> 00:34:20.690
murderers. They're all pieces of shit. The people
that took your friends are the biggest pieces of

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.390
shit in the entire place.

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:23.771
MARISHA: That's nice.

00:34:23.771 --> 00:34:25.081
SAM: Who are they?

00:34:25.081 --> 00:34:36.172
ASHLY: They're called the Iron Shepherds. Slavers.
Murderers. Basic pieces of shit. They're very good

00:34:36.172 --> 00:34:44.177
at what they do. They are the scariest, most
powerful people that I've probably ever met, and

00:34:44.177 --> 00:34:47.061
I've met a lot of people. I grew up in Shadycreek
Run.

00:34:47.061 --> 00:34:53.430
LIAM: When you say powerful, are you talking about
ability, or connections, or both?

00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.966
ASHLY: Both.

00:34:53.966 --> 00:34:54.791
LIAM: Shit.

00:34:54.791 --> 00:35:00.109
ASHLY: Everybody knows them there.

00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:02.518
MARISHA: You said slavers?

00:35:02.518 --> 00:35:08.599
ASHLY: Yeah. Sorry to break it you, but your pals
just got taken into slavery.

00:35:08.599 --> 00:35:17.046
SAM: Why are they operating this far from "the
Run?" Also what kind of slavers-- These are

00:35:17.046 --> 00:35:19.958
powerful people that they just kidnapped.

00:35:19.958 --> 00:35:22.039
ASHLY: Yeah. That's what they want.

00:35:22.039 --> 00:35:25.093
LIAM: This is why maybe they took the beefy ones.

00:35:25.093 --> 00:35:32.859
ASHLY: They're not trying to find weaklings on the
side of the road. Which is why it seems like most

00:35:32.859 --> 00:35:34.353
of you people got spared--

00:35:34.353 --> 00:35:36.319
SAM: Okay, okay. You don't know us.

00:35:36.319 --> 00:35:39.142
ASHLY: Hey, you bared your teeth at me five times,
little man!

00:35:39.142 --> 00:35:46.976
SAM: I gave you a little bourbon! I'm a lady. I
gave you some booze. The least you could do is

00:35:46.976 --> 00:35:48.963
afford us the benefit of the doubt.

00:35:48.963 --> 00:35:49.564
ASHLY: Sorry.

00:35:49.564 --> 00:35:53.551
TALIESIN: She does have a fair point, though. We
are a little squishy.

00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:58.183
ASHLY: I'm not really good at the people thing.

00:35:58.183 --> 00:35:59.984
TALIESIN: You're in good company right now.

00:35:59.984 --> 00:36:03.448
SAM: Beau is terrible with relationships and
social interactions!

00:36:03.448 --> 00:36:07.442
MARISHA: That's why we clearly got off to a great
start. Sorry.

00:36:07.442 --> 00:36:11.032
LIAM: I'm not very good at it either, and you are
an exile.

00:36:11.032 --> 00:36:13.588
MARISHA: I'm also trying to work on the manners
thing.

00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:15.227
ASHLY: Cool, all right.

00:36:15.227 --> 00:36:23.266
MARISHA: The guy who actually got taken from us
was helping me.

00:36:23.266 --> 00:36:25.668
TALIESIN: We lost the charm.

00:36:25.668 --> 00:36:28.646
SAM: Do you know any of their names, the
Shepherds?

00:36:28.646 --> 00:36:30.565
ASHLY: Yeah, I know all of them.

00:36:30.565 --> 00:36:32.433
SAM: Who are they?

00:36:32.433 --> 00:36:42.665
ASHLY: Okay. Before that, here's the deal. I have
some beef, as you may have gathered, with this

00:36:42.665 --> 00:36:48.043
crew. I'm not interested in just getting your
friends and getting out. I want to fucking kill

00:36:48.043 --> 00:36:53.063
every single last one of them. If you want any
more information from me, I'm going to need a

00:36:53.063 --> 00:36:54.293
little bit of buy-in.

00:36:54.293 --> 00:36:57.729
TALIESIN: I just toss 20 gold and I'm like, throw
me a cigarette please.

00:36:57.729 --> 00:37:07.700
SAM: 20 gold is expensive. Wait, so if you could
rescue your friends, or friend, or whatever--

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.310
ASHLY: There ain't nobody left to rescue, man.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.987
SAM: Are you sure?

00:37:11.987 --> 00:37:14.315
ASHLY: Yeah, pretty fucking sure.

00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:16.382
SAM: So it's revenge, then.

00:37:16.382 --> 00:37:17.116
ASHLY: Yeah.

00:37:17.116 --> 00:37:21.338
MARISHA: If Shadycreek Run is full of a bunch of
criminals, and you said you lived there for a

00:37:21.338 --> 00:37:23.181
while, what were you doing there?

00:37:23.181 --> 00:37:24.968
ASHLY: It's not important.

00:37:24.968 --> 00:37:27.393
MARISHA: Well that's pretty clear.

00:37:27.393 --> 00:37:36.669
ASHLY: No one there did anything nice. Okay? So
fucking imagine something shitty, and I probably

00:37:36.669 --> 00:37:44.170
did it, okay? I'm not proud of it! I'm trying to
turn a new leaf, as it were.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.881
SAM: I just imagined some crazy shit.

00:37:46.881 --> 00:37:49.465
(laughter)

00:37:49.465 --> 00:37:53.953
MARISHA: It's like a horror film. The more you
leave it up to your imagination, the worse it is.

00:37:53.953 --> 00:38:02.687
TALIESIN: I'm not one to interrogate someone's
past. Information's information. We could use some help.

00:38:02.687 --> 00:38:10.963
ASHLY: If you want my aid, I know that place like
the back of my hand. I need some kind of assurance

00:38:10.963 --> 00:38:15.418
that when we find these motherfuckers you're not
just going to grab your friends and run. Because

00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:18.348
I'm going to need some backup if I'm going to take
them out.

00:38:18.348 --> 00:38:21.036
MARISHA: How about equal assurance that you don't
fuck us over?

00:38:21.036 --> 00:38:22.293
TALIESIN: You could also hire us.

00:38:22.293 --> 00:38:23.529
ASHLY: Hire you?

00:38:23.529 --> 00:38:24.270
TALIESIN: 20 gold.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.289
ASHLY: You just gave me 20 gold.

00:38:26.289 --> 00:38:27.685
TALIESIN: Yes, that's how I know you can afford
us.

00:38:27.685 --> 00:38:30.592
(laughter)

00:38:30.592 --> 00:38:33.405
ASHLY: 20 gold, all told?

00:38:33.405 --> 00:38:36.124
TALIESIN: And we split whatever we find.

00:38:36.124 --> 00:38:42.232
MARISHA: And you don't fuck us, and we don't fuck
you. Unless, like... you know...

00:38:42.232 --> 00:38:45.895
TALIESIN: You pay at the end of the deal.

00:38:45.895 --> 00:38:49.330
ASHLY: All right, deal.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:51.751
MARISHA: It's been a while.

00:38:51.751 --> 00:38:56.256
SAM: You're confident that you can lead us to
these Shepherds.

00:38:56.256 --> 00:38:58.518
ASHLY: I've been tracking them for a while.

00:38:58.518 --> 00:39:04.964
LIAM: You know, we are, some of us, a
self-deprecating lot. We have some skill between

00:39:04.964 --> 00:39:10.968
the four of us, but it would help a lot to know
what kind of people-- not just assholes; we are

00:39:10.968 --> 00:39:14.695
assholes-- what kind of assholes we are talking
about.

00:39:14.695 --> 00:39:22.450
ASHLY: Sorcerers. Barbarians. There's a little
shit that's a rogue.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.875
SAM: How many of them are there?

00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:27.875
ASHLY: There's five.

00:39:27.875 --> 00:39:30.421
SAM: Hey, we're five!

00:39:30.421 --> 00:39:36.353
ASHLY: Yeah, kind of. We're probably a good three
and a half, if we're being honest.

00:39:36.353 --> 00:39:41.380
SAM: Don't put yourself down like that. I'm sure
you can hold your own.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:47.194
ASHLY: I'm talking about you mostly, sweet cheeks.
There's five.

00:39:47.194 --> 00:39:53.731
LIAM: Are they part of a larger organization, or
are they off themselves? It's just them?

00:39:53.731 --> 00:39:58.858
ASHLY: They work for someone, a family in Shady
Creek Run. They're powerful.

00:39:58.858 --> 00:40:00.045
MARISHA: They're mobsters!

00:40:00.045 --> 00:40:03.692
Weird question: have I heard about this
group, considering my background?

00:40:03.692 --> 00:40:05.054
MATT: Make a history check.

00:40:05.054 --> 00:40:17.183
MARISHA: History. My history changed here
recently. That's my second natural one in a row.

00:40:17.183 --> 00:40:21.676
I'm going to get rid of this one. Where's Laura
with her dice jail when you need it? That's an 18

00:40:21.676 --> 00:40:23.446
that I just rolled now.

00:40:23.446 --> 00:40:30.782
MATT: You have not heard of the Iron Shepherds
before. You have some base knowledge of some

00:40:30.782 --> 00:40:35.148
families that might do business in the outside,
but the information you've been given so far, the

00:40:35.148 --> 00:40:37.060
Iron Shepherds don't ring a bell.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.662
MARISHA: Okay.

00:40:37.662 --> 00:40:47.274
SAM: You know, when we were in Zadash, we heard
the town crier talking about kidnappings in

00:40:47.518 --> 00:40:54.202
Nogvurot. That's close to Shadycreek Run. Could
that be the same people, do you think?

00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:58.578
ASHLY: I mean, possibly. There's a lot of folks
doing the same kind of work. These folk happen to

00:40:58.578 --> 00:40:59.825
be the best at it.

00:40:59.825 --> 00:41:05.968
MARISHA: Do you know all of the members of this
Iron Brigade-- what's it called?

00:41:05.968 --> 00:41:06.568
ASHLY: Close enough.

00:41:06.568 --> 00:41:07.545
MARISHA: Iron Shepherds.

00:41:07.545 --> 00:41:08.920
SAM: Iron Chef.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.871
MARISHA: Iron Shep.

00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:16.993
ASHLY: That's my favorite travelling cuisine
entertainment.

00:41:16.993 --> 00:41:20.029
LIAM: I prefer Iron Fem Shepard.

00:41:20.029 --> 00:41:21.450
MARISHA: For sure.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:28.035
(laughter)

00:41:28.035 --> 00:41:31.049
ASHLY: This is my favorite D&amp;amp;D game on the
Citadel.

00:41:31.049 --> 00:41:37.225
MATT: There it was. I was waiting for it. If
someone else wasn't going to get there, I was

00:41:37.225 --> 00:41:39.597
going to do it. So thank you for taking it.

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:51.286
MARISHA: One of them wouldn't happen to be named
Ophelia Mardun, were they? No? Okay. That's the

00:41:51.286 --> 00:41:55.691
woman we have to find for The Gentleman. That's
part of the reason we're going.

00:41:55.691 --> 00:41:58.153
TALIESIN: I try not to learn their names. I don't
want to get attached.

00:41:58.153 --> 00:42:00.005
ASHLY: No.

00:42:00.005 --> 00:42:06.859
MATT: There is an aspect of that name that does
ring a bell: the last name.

00:42:06.859 --> 00:42:08.607
ASHLY: Oh shit, say that again?

00:42:08.607 --> 00:42:10.070
MARISHA: Mardun.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:12.449
SAM: Here, let me pour you some more booze.

00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:13.297
ASHLY: Thank you.

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:15.754
SAM: Does that help?

00:42:15.754 --> 00:42:27.414
ASHLY: Yes, I suddenly remember that name. I know
the family. They've got connections there. In

00:42:27.414 --> 00:42:33.369
fact, the folks that the Iron Shepherds work for
happen to hate that family.

00:42:33.369 --> 00:42:35.842
SAM: This is all connected!

00:42:35.842 --> 00:42:37.747
MARISHA: Rival mob gangs!

00:42:37.747 --> 00:42:42.019
SAM: It's like a conspiracy, and we're in the
middle of it!

00:42:42.019 --> 00:42:46.256
ASHLY: You being a detective, you hear other
people say information and then you remark upon

00:42:46.256 --> 00:42:49.360
it, and then that's you saying you're a great
detective?

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.256
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:42:50.256 --> 00:43:01.277
SAM: In large part. The subject was confused as to
what a detective is. I'm not writing. I don't have

00:43:01.277 --> 00:43:11.913
a quill. It's something that me and one of our
lost friends talked about a lot. Sorry.

00:43:11.913 --> 00:43:16.333
ASHLY: Sorry. Again, I'm not great with people.

00:43:16.333 --> 00:43:23.033
LIAM: Do we have an arrangement here? A deal?

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:26.289
SAM: We'll kill these folks, or try to anyway.

00:43:26.289 --> 00:43:28.918
ASHLY: I don't like that last part.

00:43:28.918 --> 00:43:34.699
SAM: What if one gets away? We're going to hunt
them down over our lifetime? I don't know, what if

00:43:34.699 --> 00:43:42.920
they go far away? Are we indebted to you forever
now, or can we put a 30 day cap on this?

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:50.501
LIAM: These three are of great value to us and
they are our friends, and we are better off with

00:43:50.501 --> 00:43:55.596
them, and it is worth the trouble. We cannot
accomplish what we've come out here to do in the

00:43:55.596 --> 00:43:58.329
first place without them. What?

00:43:58.329 --> 00:44:03.050
SAM: Nothing. You sure sound like our new leader.

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.899
MARISHA: Wait, what about me?

00:44:05.899 --> 00:44:07.932
TALIESIN: Don't panic about it, it's going to be
fine.

00:44:07.932 --> 00:44:08.947
SAM: Oh yeah, no.

00:44:08.947 --> 00:44:10.549
MARISHA: Aw, cool. Real cool, Nott.

00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:12.403
SAM: I mean, he's got the intelligence.

00:44:12.403 --> 00:44:16.325
LIAM: You be the leader. But do we have a deal?

00:44:16.325 --> 00:44:18.731
ASHLY: Yeah, we have a deal.

00:44:18.731 --> 00:44:21.590
TALIESIN: I'm all in for this.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:25.819
ASHLY: All right. Well, let's get going, then.

00:44:25.819 --> 00:44:30.532
SAM: Are you just walking? Do you have any means
of transportation?

00:44:30.532 --> 00:44:31.932
ASHLY: Do I look like I have-- no!

00:44:31.932 --> 00:44:33.923
TALIESIN: We have spare horses now.

00:44:33.923 --> 00:44:34.506
SAM: We do.

00:44:34.506 --> 00:44:37.859
MATT: At which point, you look over past the camp
where they are, and there's a cart and there are a

00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:43.495
number of horses that are currently hitched to it
at the moment. For a brief moment, you're like,

00:44:43.495 --> 00:44:47.203
Oh, the thought of not having to travel on foot
sounds fantastic.

00:44:47.203 --> 00:44:49.813
ASHLY: Let's do that. Let's please, god, do that.

00:44:49.813 --> 00:44:51.533
TALIESIN: We're half packed already.

00:44:51.533 --> 00:44:59.104
MATT: As you guys pack up your goods, get the rest
of your material packed up, couple things to keep

00:44:59.104 --> 00:45:03.630
in mind. Looking at the map, if you want to pull
it out and get an idea of the direction you're traveling.

00:45:04.405 --> 00:45:08.831
SAM: Oh, we have a map of some sort? Should we lay
it out on the table and see if--

00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:17.160
MATT: As long you guys can see it is more the job
here. You can travel with your horses--

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:17.927
SAM: Weights?

00:45:17.927 --> 00:45:19.015
MARISHA: Sam take one side.

00:45:19.015 --> 00:45:20.805
MATT: With your horse and cart--

00:45:20.805 --> 00:45:23.318
MARISHA: Sponsored by Wyrmwood.

00:45:23.318 --> 00:45:25.554
MATT: Look at that! Timing.

00:45:25.554 --> 00:45:27.066
TALIESIN: That's how it's done.

00:45:27.066 --> 00:45:27.883
SAM: Thank you.

00:45:27.883 --> 00:45:29.934
TALIESIN: There you go.

00:45:29.934 --> 00:45:39.601
MATT: You guys are currently right... here. So you
just left Hupperdook, you're on the Crispvale

00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:46.981
Roadway making your way to the Crispvale Thicket
which is the large forest at the crossroads. You

00:45:46.981 --> 00:45:54.954
can travel about 24 miles per an eight hour day at
a normal pace with the horses and cart, you can go

00:45:54.954 --> 00:46:04.158
30 miles at a fast pace, and you can force a march
to go for another hour, or two, or three afterward

00:46:04.158 --> 00:46:08.941
but you start making constitution saving throws or
take exhaustion points at that point. But you can

00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:13.569
get quite a good distance depending on how fast
you're going. The cart keeps you at a slower pace.

00:46:13.569 --> 00:46:16.162
If you were to leave the cart behind as an option,
you could go faster.

00:46:16.162 --> 00:46:20.815
SAM: But we'd have to ditch some gear, or do we
have enough horses to carry everything including shields?

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.742
TALIESIN: We would have to ditch some.

00:46:22.742 --> 00:46:27.393
LIAM: Yeah, I think we ditch the cart. They've got
hours on us, we need to make time.

00:46:27.393 --> 00:46:28.448
MARISHA: I agree.

00:46:28.448 --> 00:46:31.376
TALIESIN: How much can we carry?

00:46:31.376 --> 00:46:36.991
SAM: Can we carry all of our friends' stuff on a
horse? We have six horses, I think.

00:46:36.991 --> 00:46:40.046
MATT: You have six horses between five of you, as
long as one of you takes the horse head you can

00:46:40.046 --> 00:46:46.832
have a pack horse, essentially. It's going to be
hard to direct it, unless someone keeps it hitched

00:46:46.832 --> 00:46:52.836
on the side. Having an additional horse right now,
how are you going to get that to come with you at

00:46:52.836 --> 00:46:56.034
a fast pace... without a rider?

00:46:56.034 --> 00:46:58.118
LIAM: And we can't carry their stuff without.

00:46:58.118 --> 00:47:04.230
MATT: You can probably carry a few things. You
still have horses to help carry things, most of

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:08.340
your gear you can still put on yourself. Are there
any large things? You're not carrying a manticore

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.245
head anymore.

00:47:09.245 --> 00:47:13.723
LIAM: We leave the shield. It's not a magical
shield, it's not special.

00:47:13.723 --> 00:47:14.468
SAM: It's not?

00:47:14.468 --> 00:47:14.982
MARISHA: Jester's?

00:47:14.982 --> 00:47:15.932
LIAM: It's run of the mill.

00:47:15.932 --> 00:47:16.784
MARISHA: Well, hang on.

00:47:16.784 --> 00:47:17.861
SAM: It's not special to her in any way?

00:47:17.861 --> 00:47:19.518
MARISHA: I open the haversack.

00:47:19.518 --> 00:47:20.598
LIAM: Life is more special.

00:47:20.598 --> 00:47:22.054
MARISHA: And start trying to shove as much as I
can in the haversack.

00:47:22.054 --> 00:47:23.947
LIAM: Ow, what are you doing?

00:47:23.947 --> 00:47:26.295
MARISHA: I'm trying to-- Just wait, don't move.

00:47:26.295 --> 00:47:33.329
MATT: The main pack, I'd say you can-- I'm going
to say the shield's not going to fully fit in it

00:47:33.329 --> 00:47:36.352
unfortunately. It's a fairly wide shield and won't
quite fit.

00:47:36.352 --> 00:47:39.247
MARISHA: What about a tent? Can I shove a tent in
here?

00:47:39.247 --> 00:47:44.993
MATT: A tent you can probably mangle and push in
there and you manage to get the tent in. But the

00:47:44.993 --> 00:47:47.453
shield someone will have to wear on their back or
strap to a horse.

00:47:47.453 --> 00:47:48.755
MARISHA: Yeah, let's strap it to a horse.

00:47:48.755 --> 00:47:51.466
TALIESIN: Are we going to try and pack horse this?
Is that how we're--?

00:47:51.466 --> 00:47:52.824
MARISHA: No I think we can...

00:47:52.824 --> 00:47:55.036
LIAM: Go faster without a spare horse.

00:47:55.036 --> 00:47:56.254
MARISHA: I think the shield and--

00:47:56.254 --> 00:47:58.811
SAM: The big things we're leaving?

00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:01.837
MARISHA: We put a tent in there and if we want to
attach another tent to the back.

00:48:01.837 --> 00:48:04.244
LIAM: DM, you said we could put the shield on the
side of a horse?

00:48:04.244 --> 00:48:08.199
MATT: You can put the shield-- strap it to a
horse, it's fine because it's just an additional

00:48:08.199 --> 00:48:10.727
thing you're strapping on to it. It's up to you.

00:48:10.727 --> 00:48:11.378
LIAM: Okay.

00:48:11.378 --> 00:48:16.294
MATT: It's just the additional horse is going to
be a problem if you're going to travel at a fast pace.

00:48:16.304 --> 00:48:19.942
LIAM: Well then, we shouldn't do that, we should
go as fast as we can right now.

00:48:19.942 --> 00:48:20.436
SAM: All right.

00:48:20.436 --> 00:48:22.483
MARISHA: So we're leaving behind a horse and a
cart.

00:48:22.483 --> 00:48:26.581
TALIESIN: Or we take the horse and cart at
reasonable speed.

00:48:26.581 --> 00:48:28.191
SAM: No, we should leave them.

00:48:28.191 --> 00:48:35.241
MARISHA: Is there a town coming up? Or some place
where we can quickly sell the horse and cart?

00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:36.103
TALIESIN: Or stow it.

00:48:36.103 --> 00:48:42.555
MATT: No, there is the Crispvale Thicket ahead
which has the crossroads, but there's no town

00:48:42.555 --> 00:48:48.487
there-- Hupperdook behind you, or, honestly,
Nogvurot or Shadycreek Run.

00:48:48.487 --> 00:48:52.940
MARISHA: We lead the horse to water, we force it
to drink, we give it some food, hope it lives.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.622
LIAM: We set it free.

00:48:54.622 --> 00:48:56.061
MARISHA: Maybe come back and find it.

00:48:56.061 --> 00:48:58.882
LIAM: Or it's free or somebody gets a new horse.

00:48:58.882 --> 00:49:01.091
MARISHA: We hang a sign on it. "Free horse."

00:49:01.091 --> 00:49:06.644
SAM: Why don't we kill it and take some meat? All
right, let's just leave it.

00:49:06.644 --> 00:49:10.705
ASHLY: I mean, not to put a damper on it, but if
you leave a horse around here, it's probably going

00:49:10.705 --> 00:49:12.793
to get killed. There's a lot of shady folks around
here.

00:49:12.793 --> 00:49:15.121
SAM: I mean, the horses are all named after--

00:49:15.121 --> 00:49:16.382
MARISHA: Poop.

00:49:16.382 --> 00:49:18.458
SAM: Poop. So we can probably--

00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:21.599
MATT: So which one do you leave behind then?

00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:26.319
SAM: I believe we're going to take WC, Loo, John,
Crapper, and Toilet, but we're going to leave Loaf.

00:49:26.319 --> 00:49:29.118
(laughter)

00:49:29.118 --> 00:49:33.319
TALIESIN: So we're going to drop a Loaf.

00:49:33.319 --> 00:49:38.277
SAM: We're going to drop a quick Loaf, then go.
It's always better to drop a Loaf before you go.

00:49:38.277 --> 00:49:41.294
TALIESIN: Let's leave a marker.

00:49:41.294 --> 00:49:43.588
ASHLY: I'm starting to rethink my agreement to
work with you guys.

00:49:43.588 --> 00:49:45.283
MATT: Welcome to the Mighty Nein.

00:49:45.283 --> 00:49:49.389
TALIESIN: If he's going to die, we have to leave a
marker so we can come back and find where he's

00:49:49.389 --> 00:49:50.056
been interred.

00:49:50.056 --> 00:49:50.702
SAM: Sure.

00:49:50.702 --> 00:49:53.318
TALIESIN: Poop joke.

00:49:53.318 --> 00:49:55.874
SAM: Skidmark.

00:49:55.874 --> 00:49:57.552
MATT: As you say goodbyes to Loaf...

00:49:57.552 --> 00:49:57.994
LIAM: Pinch him off.

00:49:57.994 --> 00:50:03.098
(laughter)

00:50:03.098 --> 00:50:04.839
TALIESIN: We squeezed about as much as we can out
of that one.

00:50:04.839 --> 00:50:09.412
MATT: You strap your materials to the horses you
are taking with you.

00:50:09.412 --> 00:50:11.727
TALIESIN: It's been a while.

00:50:11.727 --> 00:50:14.762
MATT: So you're going at a fast pace. That's 30
miles.

00:50:14.762 --> 00:50:16.081
SAM and MARISHA: Yep.

00:50:16.081 --> 00:50:24.619
MATT: You travel in day. Which will get you well
within the Crispvale Thicket. As you guys are

00:50:24.619 --> 00:50:30.412
riding, who's guiding this trip? Who's keeping an
eye on the road ahead of you as you go?

00:50:30.412 --> 00:50:37.227
SAM: Is one of us steering the journey, and can
another one of us be looking for clues or things

00:50:37.227 --> 00:50:38.292
along the way?

00:50:38.292 --> 00:50:39.399
MATT: You can do that. Sure.

00:50:39.399 --> 00:50:40.557
TALIESIN: I was going to say--

00:50:40.557 --> 00:50:41.525
MARISHA: Keg should lead.

00:50:41.525 --> 00:50:43.471
TALIESIN: Keg's been on this road before.

00:50:43.471 --> 00:50:48.657
ASHLY: Yeah, can someone do me a favor? Does
anyone have a piece of cloth or something they're

00:50:48.657 --> 00:50:49.129
not using?

00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:51.400
TALIESIN: I have a giant dragon tapestry.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.393
ASHLY: Could I borrow that maybe?

00:50:53.393 --> 00:50:54.427
SAM: Are you cold?

00:50:54.427 --> 00:50:57.759
MATT: This is the one thing you see strapped,
laying over the back of his horse. This giant,

00:50:57.759 --> 00:51:01.434
rolled up, thick, blue and silver tapestry.

00:51:01.434 --> 00:51:07.644
ASHLY: Okay, I wrap my head around it-- with it, I
should say. So you can't really see my face.

00:51:07.644 --> 00:51:09.272
TALIESIN: You now have a cape, it's huge.

00:51:09.272 --> 00:51:09.706
ASHLY: Okay.

00:51:09.706 --> 00:51:11.524
MATT: As you take the full tapestry or just a
piece of it.

00:51:11.524 --> 00:51:13.225
TALIESIN: I think the full tapestry.

00:51:13.225 --> 00:51:15.588
MATT: All right, so yeah-- it's you are just--

00:51:15.588 --> 00:51:17.306
SAM: Swimming in it.

00:51:17.306 --> 00:51:17.886
MATT: Yeah.

00:51:17.886 --> 00:51:19.817
SAM: Why are you hiding your face?

00:51:19.817 --> 00:51:24.741
ASHLY: I didn't leave with a lot of friends last
time I was here. So I'm trying to keep a low profile.

00:51:24.742 --> 00:51:30.859
TALIESIN: You're well disguised as a stoner's
bedroom at the moment. A dragon on a sheet.

00:51:31.404 --> 00:51:32.550
ASHLY: Perfect, I'll fit right in.

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:33.201
MATT: There you go.

00:51:33.201 --> 00:51:35.940
ASHLY: I guess I can lead, since I know where I'm
going.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:41.583
MATT: Okay. You've traveled this path before, so
it's well known. Who's keeping watch?

00:51:41.583 --> 00:51:42.734
MARISHA: I'll keep watch.

00:51:42.734 --> 00:51:44.837
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check
for me, Beau.

00:51:44.837 --> 00:51:49.441
MARISHA: Hopefully there are no more ones hiding
in there.

00:51:49.441 --> 00:51:53.750
SAM: Do you want to look at the thing, the orb?

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:54.152
MARISHA: 18.

00:51:54.152 --> 00:51:54.985
SAM: Okay, you're good.

00:51:54.985 --> 00:51:57.818
TALIESIN: Yeah, the orb, we haven't--

00:51:57.818 --> 00:52:02.252
SAM: We have to look at the orb at some point too
or hexagon. Dexa--

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:03.877
MATT and TALIESIN: Dodecahedron.

00:52:03.877 --> 00:52:04.825
SAM: Thank you.

00:52:04.825 --> 00:52:11.952
MATT: All right, as you're heading down into the
center part of the northern side of the Marrow

00:52:11.952 --> 00:52:17.998
Valley. Keeping a look ahead, you can see just as
you crest over this one little embankment, the

00:52:17.998 --> 00:52:23.046
Crispvale Thicket ahead of you. This beautiful
cluster of dark-green trees. The clouds have

00:52:23.046 --> 00:52:32.693
completely taken the sky back and it's this low,
gloomy gray as the air gets chilly, as the day

00:52:32.693 --> 00:52:39.696
progresses onward getting closer and closer to
dusk. You manage to get to the outskirts of the

00:52:39.696 --> 00:52:46.590
thicket itself. You see the trees growing thicker
and the actual canopy of dark green pine trees

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:53.228
starting to gather. You now have the opportunity,
if you want to, you can travel into the crossroads

00:52:53.228 --> 00:52:59.406
and head north, or you can skirt around the forest
off the path. Those are your-- because you

00:52:59.406 --> 00:53:04.476
haven't-- you're basically having to go to the
center and then back north, but you're on the road

00:53:04.476 --> 00:53:09.653
the whole time. Or if you wanted to skip past it,
you'll travel a little slower-- basically a

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:10.888
similar pace.

00:53:10.888 --> 00:53:13.300
SAM: But we won't encounter as many foes.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:14.160
MATT: Well you don't know.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:14.776
SAM: Okay.

00:53:14.776 --> 00:53:15.243
MATT: It just depends on your--

00:53:15.243 --> 00:53:17.872
SAM: Are we trying to avoid people or--

00:53:17.872 --> 00:53:22.064
TALIESIN: I'm more than happy to kill something at
this point. I've got some anger and aggression to

00:53:22.064 --> 00:53:22.739
work out.

00:53:22.739 --> 00:53:24.118
MARISHA: What's the faster route?

00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:26.781
MATT: Make a survival check.

00:53:30.985 --> 00:53:32.384
MARISHA: 12.

00:53:32.384 --> 00:53:38.189
MATT: Looking about, you gather the faster route
would probably be to skirt around the outside of

00:53:38.189 --> 00:53:47.875
the forest. Because you don't have to switch back
even though the terrain isn't quite as well tread.

00:53:47.875 --> 00:53:52.482
However, you've left the cart behind which means
the one factor that would've really come into

00:53:52.482 --> 00:53:53.962
that, is no longer an issue.

00:53:53.962 --> 00:53:55.666
MARISHA: We're on horses, let's just cut through.

00:53:55.666 --> 00:53:58.715
ASHLY: Do we get a sense of where they're headed?
Do we see any sign of--

00:53:58.715 --> 00:54:04.577
MATT: At this point, in the main road, there are a
number of tracks. Whether it be horse, foot, and

00:54:04.577 --> 00:54:10.737
cart and wheels of all different sizes. You're not
able to really tell what's the freshest from a

00:54:10.737 --> 00:54:13.095
glance. If you want to get off your horse and
inspect you can try.

00:54:13.095 --> 00:54:15.171
ASHLY: I'll try. Would that be--

00:54:15.171 --> 00:54:15.684
MATT: That would be survival.

00:54:15.684 --> 00:54:21.810
ASHLY: How good is my survival? Eh, it's okay. A
natty one.

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:23.096
TALIESIN: Welcome to the team.

00:54:23.096 --> 00:54:24.446
ASHLY: I don't even know what horses are anymore.

00:54:24.446 --> 00:54:27.208
MARISHA: This is a donkey.

00:54:27.208 --> 00:54:34.229
MATT: You glance down-- From atop your horse you
look down and see these smattering of patterns,

00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:39.812
and as you get down closer it just becomes dirt,
and you have no idea how to discern what came when.

00:54:39.812 --> 00:54:41.834
ASHLY: I'm drunk. That was pointless, let's keep
going.

00:54:41.834 --> 00:54:43.609
TALIESIN: (vomit sound)

00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:47.753
MATT: So, which path do you guys wish to choose?

00:54:48.376 --> 00:54:51.213
SAM: Caleb, you're in charge. Which way are we
going?

00:54:51.213 --> 00:54:52.378
TALIESIN: Oh, for gods' sakes.

00:54:52.378 --> 00:54:53.128
SAM: Well he's so--

00:54:53.128 --> 00:54:54.224
LIAM: Which way are we going?

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:55.930
MARISHA: I say we go through the woods, but you're
the leader.

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:57.842
LIAM: I said you were the leader.

00:54:57.842 --> 00:54:59.100
SAM: Caleb.

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.261
LIAM: I'm not a leader.

00:55:00.261 --> 00:55:02.492
TALIESIN: Oh, for gods' sakes, I'm going to start
going through the woods.

00:55:02.492 --> 00:55:05.312
MATT: So you're going through the thicket or
around the outside of it?

00:55:05.312 --> 00:55:06.583
MARISHA: Sorry, around. The shortcut.

00:55:06.583 --> 00:55:09.003
MATT: Okay. So you're skirting the outside of the
thicket.

00:55:09.003 --> 00:55:09.656
MARISHA: Yes.

00:55:09.656 --> 00:55:19.552
MATT: Okay. As you start cresting around the side
of the forest, within the first mile or so, you

00:55:19.552 --> 00:55:28.284
see an abandoned homestead. Maybe 200 feet or so
away from the forest on the northern side. It may

00:55:28.284 --> 00:55:33.502
have been at one time a small farmhouse, but part
of the roof is caved in. There once was a window

00:55:33.502 --> 00:55:39.112
that had pane glass that has since been shattered,
and you can see jagged edges along the bottom side

00:55:39.112 --> 00:55:39.913
of its sill.

00:55:39.913 --> 00:55:41.530
TALIESIN: What time is it?

00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:47.881
MATT: Right now? I'd say it's probably close to
four or five in the afternoon. You have a couple

00:55:47.881 --> 00:55:49.614
hours before dusk really starts hitting.

00:55:49.614 --> 00:55:53.540
TALIESIN: Do we want to head a couple hours or
have this unbelievably safe place. What looks like

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:57.476
a very safe place, although-- never mind. We're
going to-- terrible things are just going to

00:55:57.476 --> 00:56:02.646
happen. I'm accepting it, this is going to be a
cursed trip. Do we want to stay in the haunted house?

00:56:02.646 --> 00:56:06.141
MARISHA: Do you want to send in Frumpkin, bird
Frumpkin, see what he finds?

00:56:06.141 --> 00:56:09.613
LIAM: Does it look like Frumpkin could make it
through that window?

00:56:09.613 --> 00:56:18.961
MATT: Frumpkin could, yeah. And it's a one story
farmhouse. It's a modest home. Single story, maybe

00:56:18.961 --> 00:56:23.593
from first glance, three to four rooms, and the
partially collapsed roof on one side shows you

00:56:23.593 --> 00:56:27.764
that's it's been in disuse for some time. Who
knows how weathered it may be on the interior.

00:56:27.764 --> 00:56:29.249
LIAM: And what hour is it?

00:56:29.249 --> 00:56:31.079
MATT: About four or five in the afternoon.

00:56:31.079 --> 00:56:38.138
LIAM: In the afternoon. I don't see anything in
there. I mean, you want to raid an old house or

00:56:38.138 --> 00:56:40.574
keep going?

00:56:40.574 --> 00:56:42.621
MARISHA: Sleep in it, is what we're thinking.

00:56:42.621 --> 00:56:43.616
LIAM: You want to cut for the day?

00:56:43.616 --> 00:56:45.815
SAM: We want to keep going, don't we? As fast as
we can.

00:56:45.815 --> 00:56:51.873
TALIESIN: Well here's the question: do we just go
until we have to stop and then we camp wherever

00:56:51.873 --> 00:56:56.775
we're going to camp, or do we find something like
this, which is possibly a little safer and then

00:56:56.775 --> 00:57:00.350
just wake up very early and run and go further?

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:04.662
ASHLY: If you ask me, keep going. No place in this
area is going to be safer than any other.

00:57:04.662 --> 00:57:07.737
MARISHA: All right, let's keep going.

00:57:07.737 --> 00:57:09.101
LIAM: She's the local.

00:57:09.101 --> 00:57:10.464
TALIESIN: Trust the local.

00:57:10.464 --> 00:57:12.862
MATT: So you guys continue.

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:15.882
MARISHA: As we go by it-- we're headed that way,
right?

00:57:15.882 --> 00:57:17.865
SAM: Was there anyone in that house?

00:57:17.865 --> 00:57:19.528
MATT: You didn't get close enough to inspect.

00:57:19.528 --> 00:57:20.045
SAM: Oh.

00:57:20.045 --> 00:57:21.982
MARISHA: Should we check it out and see if there's
anything good?

00:57:22.379 --> 00:57:23.244
TALIESIN: Throw a falcon through the window.

00:57:23.244 --> 00:57:26.028
LIAM: Well that's what I was asking. You described
a window that was jagged glass, ja?

00:57:26.028 --> 00:57:26.536
MATT: Yeah.

00:57:26.536 --> 00:57:29.754
LIAM: But if my smallish falcon went in there, is
he going to get cut up?

00:57:29.754 --> 00:57:32.006
MATT: You can certainly try.

00:57:32.006 --> 00:57:32.778
TALIESIN: Chimney.

00:57:32.778 --> 00:57:33.625
LIAM: Going to get cut.

00:57:33.625 --> 00:57:39.580
MATT: Yeah, Frumpkin's wingspan in this form is
pretty wide, wider than the window. So Frumpkin

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.233
would have to land on the window and then probably
gingerly step in.

00:57:42.233 --> 00:57:45.026
TALIESIN: Or you could go through the chimney or
the collapsed roof.

00:57:45.026 --> 00:57:47.348
ASHLY: Or I can just go in.

00:57:47.348 --> 00:57:49.132
TALIESIN: We have--

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:51.156
ASHLY: Keg just goes to the door and kicks it
open.

00:57:51.156 --> 00:57:54.585
MATT: You guys watch as the horse rides off to the
edge. Keg leaps off the horse.

00:57:54.585 --> 00:57:55.208
TALIESIN: I like her.

00:57:55.208 --> 00:57:58.984
MATT: Stomps up and just kicks the door open. The
door is already partially ajar so it (creaks) and

00:57:58.984 --> 00:58:06.636
it falls off the top end and leans against the
back inside of the farmhouse. There's a brief

00:58:06.636 --> 00:58:12.333
moment where you feel a couple things settle, a
slight creak and the fall of dust, and as you step

00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:18.689
inside you can see the furniture is in disarray.
There is a layer of dust everywhere. There is a

00:58:18.689 --> 00:58:26.772
smell of old rot and mildew. And glancing inside,
you can see there's another window on the opposite

00:58:26.772 --> 00:58:31.585
side that's also been busted out. This place is
pretty thrashed.

00:58:31.585 --> 00:58:33.285
ASHLY: There's nothing in here!

00:58:33.285 --> 00:58:34.532
LIAM: Are there any books?

00:58:34.532 --> 00:58:36.685
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop in there as well.

00:58:36.685 --> 00:58:38.467
SAM: I'll go take a look.

00:58:38.467 --> 00:58:39.092
LIAM: Books!

00:58:39.092 --> 00:58:40.982
SAM: I'll look for you.

00:58:40.982 --> 00:58:42.039
TALIESIN: We always know to look.

00:58:42.039 --> 00:58:43.654
ASHLY: I'm not going to look for boo-- Oh god.

00:58:43.654 --> 00:58:44.709
MATT: Are you looking for--

00:58:44.709 --> 00:58:46.313
ASHLY: Keg sits down on one of the pieces of
furniture.

00:58:46.313 --> 00:58:50.501
TALIESIN: I also want to see if there's-- does it
look like people have been in here recently?

00:58:50.501 --> 00:58:55.736
MATT: Well you make an investigation check on
that. And you make an investigation check to look

00:58:55.736 --> 00:58:57.166
for things. And if you want--

00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:58.328
ASHLY: Can I look for booze?

00:58:58.328 --> 00:58:58.875
SAM: 18.

00:58:58.875 --> 00:58:59.703
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

00:58:59.703 --> 00:59:01.291
TALIESIN: Nothing of value.

00:59:01.291 --> 00:59:02.514
ASHLY: Three.

00:59:02.514 --> 00:59:05.082
MATT: Oh. Sadly no booze.

00:59:05.082 --> 00:59:05.701
ASHLY: Damn it.

00:59:05.701 --> 00:59:06.669
MATT: What did you roll?

00:59:06.669 --> 00:59:07.291
TALIESIN: A two.

00:59:07.291 --> 00:59:10.738
MATT: Hard to tell in this space.

00:59:10.738 --> 00:59:12.084
TALIESIN: That's not fair.

00:59:12.084 --> 00:59:18.260
MATT: A lot of the furniture looks damaged, some
of it looks burned weirdly. As you, looking around

00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:25.808
on the inside, you're rummaging around for any
possible books or anything that can be useful. You

00:59:25.808 --> 00:59:32.785
don't find any books, you do manage to find a
bundle of unused torches, five. You have a handaxe

00:59:32.785 --> 00:59:40.039
that's a little old and rusted, but it's still
functional. It's well made. That was left under

00:59:40.039 --> 00:59:45.610
one of the shelves that had fallen over. And you
find a mostly filled oil lantern. While the glass

00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:50.522
of the actual lantern is broken, it still is
pretty filled with oil. So if you wanted to-- if

00:59:50.522 --> 00:59:53.698
you had a container, you could fill it and have a
flask of oil.

00:59:53.698 --> 00:59:55.586
SAM: I have an extra flask.

00:59:55.586 --> 00:59:57.265
MATT: Then you can go ahead and fill it with oil.

00:59:57.265 --> 00:59:58.049
SAM: I will fill that with oil.

00:59:58.049 --> 00:59:59.950
MATT: Now you have a flask of oil at your
disposal.

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:00.466
SAM: Nice.

01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:04.043
TALIESIN: Is there a crest on the fireplace or
anything like that? Any markings of who might have

01:00:04.043 --> 01:00:05.572
lived here at one point?

01:00:05.572 --> 01:00:14.807
MATT: No crests. You glance and you do see a
small, iron symbol that looks like a star or sun.

01:00:14.807 --> 01:00:19.605
You recognize it to be the symbol of Pelor. It
probably was a mantle of worship here, but it's,

01:00:19.605 --> 01:00:26.776
looking on it, the metal looks scarred, strangely.
It's almost like elements of-- as you pick it up

01:00:26.776 --> 01:00:32.077
and glance at it, the pockmark scarring on it is
strange. And the mantle around it, you can see, a

01:00:32.077 --> 01:00:35.811
lot of the wood and stonework seems to have been
smoothed over in its damage.

01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:36.875
TALIESIN: Can I remove the piece?

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:38.069
MATT: Yeah. It snaps off.

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:41.555
TALIESIN: I'm going to take it. Well this
obviously brought luck to whoever was here.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:43.769
(quietly) I have a symbol of Pelor.

01:00:43.769 --> 01:00:48.725
SAM: I'll just go around and ask: does anyone need
any torches? I found a bunch.

01:00:48.725 --> 01:00:50.350
MARISHA: I'll take a couple torches.

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:51.048
TALIESIN: I'll take a torch.

01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:52.411
SAM: You can each have one.

01:00:52.411 --> 01:00:54.862
ASHLY: Sure, I'll take a torch.

01:00:54.862 --> 01:00:57.488
MATT: You get a torch, and you get a torch.

01:00:57.488 --> 01:01:00.812
SAM: And how about a handaxe, anyone?

01:01:00.812 --> 01:01:02.613
LIAM: Nein.

01:01:02.613 --> 01:01:04.274
MARISHA: Nah, I'm good.

01:01:04.274 --> 01:01:10.338
TALIESIN: Caleb, you want to do a little scan
while we're here? See if anything tingles your fancy?

01:01:10.344 --> 01:01:16.018
LIAM: (sighs) We're killing time but yes I do. I
take the ten minutes to take the book out of the

01:01:16.018 --> 01:01:21.149
holster, and set it on the ground and while
everyone just sits there in the dust, I cast

01:01:21.149 --> 01:01:22.005
Detect Magic.

01:01:22.005 --> 01:01:23.632
MATT: Okay. So how long does it take for that?

01:01:23.632 --> 01:01:24.873
LIAM: Ten minutes.

01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:26.210
MATT: Ten minutes, okay.

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.957
LIAM: Wait. Wait.

01:01:26.957 --> 01:01:27.964
TALIESIN: Wait.

01:01:27.964 --> 01:01:28.522
MATT: Wait.

01:01:28.522 --> 01:01:29.538
MATT: As a ritual I believe it's ten minutes,
correct?

01:01:29.538 --> 01:01:30.083
LIAM: Yeah.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:35.008
MATT: All right, so Caleb-- you're having this
moment where you're waiting as he's just poring

01:01:35.008 --> 01:01:40.231
over this tome and drawing a circle on the ground
and inscribing strange symbols in the air. It

01:01:40.231 --> 01:01:42.163
doesn't make any sense. You're like, "Ah, magic
stuff."

01:01:42.163 --> 01:01:42.765
ASHLY: Right.

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:43.806
SAM: Want another drink?

01:01:43.806 --> 01:01:44.881
ASHLY &amp;amp; TALIESIN: Yes.

01:01:44.881 --> 01:01:46.471
SAM: (pouring noise)

01:01:46.471 --> 01:01:47.100
ASHLY: Thank you.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.403
TALIESIN: Bless you.

01:01:48.403 --> 01:01:50.303
MATT: Everybody else roll a perception check, if
you don't mind.

01:01:50.303 --> 01:01:53.631
SAM: Okay.

01:01:53.631 --> 01:01:54.509
TALIESIN: Ah.

01:01:54.509 --> 01:01:55.120
SAM: 13.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:55.687
TALIESIN: 14.

01:01:55.687 --> 01:01:56.420
ASHLY: 17.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:57.325
MATT: 17, what did you get?

01:01:57.325 --> 01:01:57.948
TALIESIN: 14.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:58.887
ASHLY: (counting) 19 actually.

01:01:58.887 --> 01:01:59.610
MARISHA: 16.

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:09.166
MATT: Beau and Keg, you guys hear some noises out
back. The horses are getting a little restless and

01:02:09.166 --> 01:02:14.992
nervous. They're like (anxious chuffing) and you
see two of them are starting to clomp back a bit

01:02:14.992 --> 01:02:21.272
away from the house. Starting to pull at the reins
that have been hitched off to the side of the home.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:24.842
ASHLY: Hey, you might want to finish your fairy
shit. There's something going on outside.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:32.943
MATT: At that point, trying to take in what is
sending these horses into a weird tizzy, and you

01:02:32.943 --> 01:02:38.649
feel this faint vibration in the ground, this very
subtle quaking.

01:02:38.649 --> 01:02:42.216
MARISHA: I'm still outside on my horse. So I'm
going to ride around to the back of the house, and

01:02:42.216 --> 01:02:43.439
see if I see anything.

01:02:43.439 --> 01:02:46.430
ASHLY: I'm going to run outside, and see if I see
anything.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:50.968
MATT: Okay, still utilizing the same perception
checks you have, looking in both directions,

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:58.328
nothing. There is-- you're maybe a little over a
hundred feet or so from the tree line. Which is

01:02:58.328 --> 01:03:03.325
what you were staying close to, to not be out in
the middle of the open field. But you don't see

01:03:03.325 --> 01:03:04.545
anything coming or going.

01:03:04.545 --> 01:03:06.881
TALIESIN: I'll pull a single sword and guard
Caleb.

01:03:06.881 --> 01:03:07.921
MATT: Okay.

01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:13.283
MARISHA: I'm going to jump off my horse and get on
the ground and feel the ground. Do I feel any vibrations?

01:03:13.283 --> 01:03:29.063
MATT: You do. There's this faint (soft rumbling),
and it seems to be moving in shifts or in pulses

01:03:29.063 --> 01:03:32.959
of intensity, getting more intense and some of
them longer and some of them shorter.

01:03:32.959 --> 01:03:35.399
MARISHA: I-- were you going to keep going?

01:03:35.399 --> 01:03:37.335
MATT: No, that's what you're sensing.

01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:40.997
MARISHA: I say: Get off the ground!

01:03:40.997 --> 01:03:41.776
TALIESIN: All right.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:46.368
MARISHA: And I run, and I'm going to try and
parkour up onto the roof of this thing.

01:03:46.368 --> 01:03:50.654
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and push Caleb awake
and go for a tree.

01:03:50.654 --> 01:03:51.482
LIAM: Oh yeah, I hear everything.

01:03:51.482 --> 01:03:52.015
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:03:52.015 --> 01:03:52.801
LIAM: Okay, what--

01:03:52.801 --> 01:03:54.954
TALIESIN: Let's go! let's go! And we're going to
head for a tree.

01:03:54.954 --> 01:03:56.485
MATT: Okay, you guys are headed for the trees?

01:03:56.485 --> 01:03:57.089
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

01:03:57.089 --> 01:03:57.788
LIAM: Dispel the spell.

01:03:57.788 --> 01:04:03.824
MATT: Spell's lost, Molly and Caleb start running
out of the home to the tree line. And you're just

01:04:03.824 --> 01:04:04.778
going up on the roof?

01:04:04.778 --> 01:04:07.529
MARISHA: Is there a roof to be got upon?

01:04:07.529 --> 01:04:09.470
MATT: You're still on horseback, you can jump off
your horse.

01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:12.311
MARISHA: No, I jumped off my horse to feel the
ground.

01:04:12.846 --> 01:04:15.699
MATT: Right, right. So you're leaving your horse
there and if-- you can try and look up on the

01:04:15.699 --> 01:04:18.134
roof. Part of it's collapsed. You don't know the
state it's in, but you can try.

01:04:18.134 --> 01:04:20.654
MARISHA: I'll get on my horse and head for the
tree line with everyone else.

01:04:20.654 --> 01:04:23.641
MATT: Okay (galloping). You start heading back to
the tree line. What are you guys doing?

01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:28.474
ASHLY: So we can't tell if this is a creature or
a-- we just can feel the ground rumbling.

01:04:28.474 --> 01:04:31.602
MATT: You can't, you haven't sensed anything.
Everyone has just started getting nervous and

01:04:31.602 --> 01:04:35.814
rushing for the tree line. You can hear the faint
rumbling, and it is getting louder.

01:04:35.814 --> 01:04:42.104
MARISHA: I'm going to take-- as I get closer to
the tree line-- how far away am I?

01:04:42.104 --> 01:04:46.631
MATT: You're about 20 or so feet from the tree
line.

01:04:46.631 --> 01:04:51.581
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take my horse and I'm
going to whip it around the opposite way, going

01:04:51.581 --> 01:04:59.307
away from us, and I'm going to give it a good kick
and jump off of it. And head towards the tree line

01:04:59.307 --> 01:05:02.599
with everybody else. I'm going to head it away
from us.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:06.298
MATT: Okay. Your horse begins to head in a
southward direction.

01:05:06.896 --> 01:05:12.135
ASHLY: I'm staying where I am, and I'm taking out
my battleaxe and my warhammer. I'm going, "Come

01:05:12.135 --> 01:05:13.330
"out, you piece of shit!"

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:14.662
MATT: So you're staying by the house?

01:05:14.662 --> 01:05:15.256
ASHLY: Yeah.

01:05:15.256 --> 01:05:22.373
SAM: I'm staying in the house, and I'm going to
cover myself up with some detritus of different

01:05:23.207 --> 01:05:26.377
chairs and things, near the window. I'm hiding.

01:05:26.377 --> 01:05:26.963
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:05:26.963 --> 01:05:28.268
LIAM: What are we running from?

01:05:28.268 --> 01:05:28.966
SAM: 13.

01:05:28.966 --> 01:05:32.339
MATT: Caleb and Molly, you guys are riding towards
the treeline.

01:05:32.339 --> 01:05:34.426
TALIESIN: We're getting some distance from
whatever.

01:05:34.426 --> 01:05:44.569
MATT: First thing you notice is a splash of dirt
to the south. You see a small detonation out of

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:50.899
the earth in the direction of where your horse had
been traveling off. You see something emerge from

01:05:50.899 --> 01:05:57.402
the ground and your horse ride up and hoof down
and begin to run back in your direction away from

01:05:57.402 --> 01:05:59.639
it. It seemed to cut it off at the south. As it is
running towards you--

01:05:59.639 --> 01:06:02.144
MARISHA: Come on, WC, come on!

01:06:02.144 --> 01:06:09.378
MATT: You see something spray or splash in its
direction as it turns, and it whinnies in horrible

01:06:09.378 --> 01:06:12.250
pain before it collapses onto the ground,
spinning.

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:13.541
MARISHA: Water Closet!

01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:14.248
SAM: Aw.

01:06:14.248 --> 01:06:20.405
MATT: It lies there on the ground, making this
horrible (squealing) sound. As you're watching,

01:06:20.405 --> 01:06:23.212
from what you can see in the distance, its flesh
burning.

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.770
ASHLY: Is it dying?

01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:34.009
MATT: It looks in a really bad place. At this
point in time, Molly and Caleb, you hear the

01:06:34.009 --> 01:06:41.007
vibration as the ground bursts to the right and
left of you. Let me get the map, since that's

01:06:41.007 --> 01:06:41.951
where we're going now.

01:06:41.951 --> 01:06:42.802
SAM: Oh! Should we move this map?

01:06:42.802 --> 01:06:44.277
MATT: Yeah, we're going to move this map out of
the way.

01:06:44.277 --> 01:06:44.852
SAM: Oh boy.

01:06:44.852 --> 01:06:47.523
TALIESIN: Oh man.

01:06:47.523 --> 01:06:49.919
ASHLY: Ah!

01:06:49.919 --> 01:06:51.156
SAM: Oh gosh!

01:06:51.156 --> 01:06:52.301
ASHLY: Ah jeez!

01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:54.455
SAM: Ashly, welcome to the show.

01:06:54.455 --> 01:06:56.164
ASHLY: Hey, thanks for having me, guys.

01:06:56.164 --> 01:06:56.800
SAM: It's been a while.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.272
ASHLY: I know. It's been a minute. Since your
one-shot, right?

01:07:00.272 --> 01:07:04.504
SAM: Yes, but that doesn't count. Weren't you on
the show-show at some point?

01:07:04.504 --> 01:07:06.223
ASHLY: Mm-mm. This is my first time on the
show-show.

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:08.499
MARISHA: Yeah, she did that goblins thing with
us.

01:07:08.499 --> 01:07:10.873
ASHLY: I've done three one-shots, but no
show-show.

01:07:10.873 --> 01:07:12.123
SAM: (gasps) That's terrible.

01:07:12.123 --> 01:07:13.282
ASHLY: (laughs) I'm here now.

01:07:13.282 --> 01:07:14.769
SAM: I mean, we're rectifying it right now.

01:07:14.769 --> 01:07:22.784
ASHLY: Goblins, The Screw Job, and then the Ass
Sailor? What was it called?

01:07:22.784 --> 01:07:25.063
SAM: The romantic cruise thing.

01:07:25.063 --> 01:07:25.588
ASHLY: Yeah.

01:07:25.588 --> 01:07:26.183
SAM: Yeah.

01:07:26.183 --> 01:07:27.378
TALIESIN: The Ass Sailor?

01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:33.114
SAM: Yeah, The Ass Sailor was the name of the--
Oh! You were in the bar! The bar was, yes, The Ass Sailor.

01:07:33.128 --> 01:07:37.418
LIAM: I keep looking over at you and thinking I'm
on the Jerry Lewis telethon.

01:07:37.418 --> 01:07:40.470
SAM: I thought we were all going to dress up
tonight.

01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:45.999
MATT: There is Caleb. There's Molly, just on the
outskirts of the forest, this way. Bursting to

01:07:45.999 --> 01:07:53.179
each side of you, you see these large insectoid
creatures that burst out of the dirt and ground.

01:07:53.179 --> 01:08:01.226
Beau, you are right over on this side, as you left
your horse on a southern direction there. Both

01:08:01.226 --> 01:08:08.126
Nott and Keg are about 100 feet that direction.

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:11.137
MATT: Your horses are currently--

01:08:11.137 --> 01:08:13.283
ASHLY: Oh, so they went after them?

01:08:13.283 --> 01:08:13.795
MATT: Yeah.

01:08:13.795 --> 01:08:14.130
ASHLY: Oh.

01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:19.249
MATT: While you guys are over by the house, you
watch as this is going on, and there doesn't

01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:22.885
appear to be any action immediately near you, so
you're quite a distance away.

01:08:22.885 --> 01:08:24.137
ASHLY: Can I rush forward now?

01:08:24.137 --> 01:08:28.457
MATT: You can. If your horse is still right by
the-- No, your horses rushed off towards the--

01:08:28.457 --> 01:08:30.989
TALIESIN: Her horse is still there.

01:08:30.989 --> 01:08:32.142
ASHLY: I think my horse is still there.

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:34.017
MATT: Your horse is still there, that's right. You
still have your horse there. You can jump on your

01:08:34.017 --> 01:08:35.084
horse and head that direction, if you want to.

01:08:35.084 --> 01:08:36.054
ASHLY: Okay, I'm going to do that.

01:08:36.054 --> 01:08:39.154
MATT: All right, so you rush onto that. I need
everybody to roll initiative, please, because we

01:08:39.154 --> 01:08:41.449
are now in combat.

01:08:41.449 --> 01:08:45.137
ASHLY: God! I think I spent all of my 20 juice on
all these one-shots.

01:08:45.644 --> 01:08:46.383
SAM: You got that.

01:08:46.383 --> 01:08:47.787
ASHLY: I know, but it's still a one!

01:08:47.787 --> 01:08:50.781
MATT: 25 to 20?

01:08:50.781 --> 01:08:51.485
MARISHA: 20.

01:08:51.485 --> 01:08:55.923
MATT: Beau's up first. 20 to 15?

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:56.578
TALIESIN: 16.

01:08:56.578 --> 01:09:00.255
MATT: Molly's up next. 15 to ten?

01:09:00.255 --> 01:09:00.855
SAM: Ten.

01:09:00.855 --> 01:09:03.074
TALIESIN: It's the anti-snitch.

01:09:03.074 --> 01:09:05.690
SAM: Nega-snitch.

01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:07.627
MATT: Caleb, what did you get?

01:09:07.627 --> 01:09:08.424
LIAM: Drei.

01:09:08.424 --> 01:09:12.880
MATT: All right. And? Ooh.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.629
ASHLY: Yeah. It makes sense. I'm riding in late.

01:09:16.629 --> 01:09:18.004
MARISHA: You're also three?

01:09:18.004 --> 01:09:18.922
ASHLY: I'm three, yes.

01:09:18.922 --> 01:09:26.079
MATT: Not so great for Keg. That's all right. Top
of the round, Beau.

01:09:26.079 --> 01:09:34.667
MARISHA: Okay. So I have this one in front of me.
Oh, man. Oh my god.

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:39.562
MATT: There's a third one down that way that's
maybe about 30 feet away from you that is heading

01:09:39.562 --> 01:09:42.509
your direction. It's up to you if you want to
pursue that or come help out your friends.

01:09:42.509 --> 01:09:47.363
MARISHA: No, I'm going to go for this one here. I
should have enough speed to clear it, 40 feet.

01:09:47.363 --> 01:09:50.684
MATT: Yeah, you should. Yeah, you can easily get
there.

01:09:50.684 --> 01:09:59.128
MARISHA: Pop, pop. Okay, so first attack. 15?

01:09:59.128 --> 01:09:59.798
MATT: 15 hits.

01:09:59.798 --> 01:10:09.181
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to spend a ki point to
stun this thing, and hopefully it doesn't save again.

01:10:09.181 --> 01:10:14.079
MATT: That is a six, a five plus one. It does not
save.

01:10:14.079 --> 01:10:17.112
MARISHA: It's stunned! Finally!

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:21.941
MATT: As you rush up to the side, you look for
what-- and what you see now, at a close look, is

01:10:21.941 --> 01:10:31.247
this massive almost eight to nine feet tall to its
head, insect-like, large cockroach-type creature.

01:10:31.247 --> 01:10:39.751
Its chitinous armored body is segmented in places.
There's large antennae and these massive pincers

01:10:39.751 --> 01:10:46.806
come out of its mouth, with its strange insectoid
eyes, this gooey saliva that's dripping out of the

01:10:46.806 --> 01:10:51.408
center of its mouth. As it spins around towards
you, you see a moment where, between its plates

01:10:51.408 --> 01:10:56.122
and its body, seems to be a soft, muscle-like
underbelly. You jam your fist in there and attack,

01:10:56.122 --> 01:11:00.024
and it seems to lock up its body for a moment.
Roll damage.

01:11:00.024 --> 01:11:12.588
MARISHA: Oh, right. Oh god, I rolled a one in
damage. So that's plus four, five damage. I'm so nervous.

01:11:12.588 --> 01:11:14.350
MATT: All right, so that's your first strike?

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:20.528
MARISHA: Yeah. Then second strike. That's a
natural 14, so I'm pretty sure that hits, plus

01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:33.403
seven, so 21. Ooh, that's an eight; it's the total
other end of the spectrum. I keep getting there.

01:11:33.403 --> 01:11:38.204
Sorry, my brain is all over the place. 12 damage.

01:11:38.204 --> 01:11:44.989
MATT: Nice. The first strike ends up as just
enough to cut past its defenses to stun it. As

01:11:44.989 --> 01:11:49.999
it's reeling from the impact, your other blow,
crack! with your staff to the side, hits it, and

01:11:49.999 --> 01:11:54.080
part of its armor cracks inward, exposing more of
its tender underbelly.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.357
MARISHA: Okay, and then I am going to spend
another ki point and do extract aspects.

01:11:58.357 --> 01:12:01.380
MATT: Okay, you want to learn three things from
it. What do you want to learn?

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:09.163
MARISHA: Three things, okay. What is its dexterity
modifier, or its dexterity saving throw?

01:12:09.163 --> 01:12:11.305
MATT: Dexterity saving throw is zero. Plus zero.

01:12:11.305 --> 01:12:18.271
MARISHA: Okay. Sorry. Dex zero. What is its
constitution saving throw?

01:12:18.271 --> 01:12:19.125
MATT: Plus one.

01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:25.531
MARISHA: Does it have any vulnerabilities?

01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:27.071
MATT: No vulnerabilities.

01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:34.901
MARISHA: Okay. I still have a bonus attack,
right?

01:12:34.901 --> 01:12:38.318
MATT: Still have a bonus attack.

01:12:38.318 --> 01:12:41.280
LIAM: Oh, wow. The suspense.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.182
MARISHA: 13.

01:12:45.182 --> 01:12:51.738
MATT: 13. Technically, your attacks have advantage
while it's stunned, so you get to roll again.

01:12:51.738 --> 01:12:55.851
MARISHA: Oh, that's right! That's even worse.

01:12:55.851 --> 01:13:00.642
MATT: Does not hit. Even while stunned, you swing
back with your fist, and your knuckles glide off

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:05.125
of part of the armor that is still hardened, and
it hurts your knuckles and you pull back a second,

01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:09.215
but it's not immediately able to do anything back
at you. That's your turn, I believe?

01:13:09.215 --> 01:13:16.271
MARISHA: Yeah. I yell to everybody and be like:
These guys don't seem very quick and shifty!

01:13:16.271 --> 01:13:18.312
SAM: Okay.

01:13:18.312 --> 01:13:26.419
MARISHA: Not too dex-y or anything. They seem
clumsy as fuck.

01:13:26.419 --> 01:13:29.142
MATT: All right, that ends your turn?

01:13:29.142 --> 01:13:31.040
MARISHA: It has shitty dexterity.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.502
MATT: Molly, you're up next.

01:13:32.502 --> 01:13:40.616
TALIESIN: I'm going to try something fancy. I'm
going to tap my new fancy sword, and I'm going to,

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:49.048
like a Pepper's ghost effect, fade out and
disappear, and move right into what would be-- get

01:13:49.048 --> 01:13:51.465
some advantage on the one that Beau's been
hitting.

01:13:51.465 --> 01:13:58.706
MATT: (counting) 30, so you're just out of range
of it, but you can use your movement to move up to it.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.340
TALIESIN: I'll use my movement to get right where
I need to be.

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.323
MATT: There you go.

01:14:01.323 --> 01:14:02.231
TALIESIN: So I have advantage now?

01:14:02.231 --> 01:14:07.430
MATT: You do. You watch as Molly fades out of
existence and then appears, Nightcrawler

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:09.490
teleport-style right behind Caleb.

01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:10.849
SAM: They killed Molly!

01:14:10.849 --> 01:14:13.117
TALIESIN: I'll take two attacks.

01:14:13.117 --> 01:14:13.768
MATT: Go for it.

01:14:13.768 --> 01:14:19.589
TALIESIN: All right. First one, a natural one and
an 18, yeah, so one hits.

01:14:20.053 --> 01:14:20.545
MATT: Yep.

01:14:24.015 --> 01:14:27.973
TALIESIN: Ooh! That's ten damage plus three.

01:14:30.213 --> 01:14:31.699
MATT: So 13 damage?

01:14:31.699 --> 01:14:42.171
TALIESIN: Yeah, 13, ten plus three. Next attack.
That's a 19.

01:14:42.171 --> 01:14:43.123
MATT: 19 hits.

01:14:43.123 --> 01:14:50.801
TALIESIN: That's nine plus two, so that's 11.

01:14:50.801 --> 01:14:57.361
MATT: 11 points of damage. All right, that'll do
it. With that, you teleport next to it and carve

01:14:57.650 --> 01:15:04.374
it asunder. It screams as you slice through it all
three times, and you bisect it in the center of

01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:10.274
where its thorax begins. Falls to the ground and
crumples into pieces, its greenish blood spilling

01:15:10.274 --> 01:15:13.922
into the dirt and floor of the forest underbrush.

01:15:13.922 --> 01:15:16.591
MARISHA: Clink! Take her staff and clink weapons.

01:15:16.591 --> 01:15:18.218
TALIESIN: Yeah, we have a little clink, and turn
and face the other one.

01:15:18.218 --> 01:15:20.106
MATT: All right, ends Molly's turn. Nott, you're
up.

01:15:20.106 --> 01:15:21.665
TALIESIN: Actually, do I have any movement left?

01:15:21.665 --> 01:15:23.454
MATT: You do. You have 25 feet of movement.

01:15:23.454 --> 01:15:27.845
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull back, and I'm going to
get ten feet in front of Caleb, right between

01:15:27.845 --> 01:15:34.979
Caleb and the insect. No, the other side of that.
Right there, to make a wall there.

01:15:34.979 --> 01:15:39.681
MATT: Perfect. There you go. Finishing your go.
Nott, you are way off that way.

01:15:39.681 --> 01:15:44.350
SAM: Yeah, I'm looking through the window of the
house, the homestead, and I'm 100 feet away?

01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:46.115
MATT: You're about 100 feet away, yeah.

01:15:46.115 --> 01:15:52.020
SAM: There's nothing I can do. I'll start walking
towards the fight.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:57.149
MATT: That's 30 feet. You could dash as a bonus
action, if you wanted to.

01:15:57.149 --> 01:16:00.115
SAM: Yeah, that'll take me 60 feet.

01:16:00.115 --> 01:16:04.050
MATT: It does seem to lose your stealth,
unfortunately.

01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:04.560
SAM: Sure.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.455
MATT: You could be low in the brush, but you're
not moving quiet, carefully.

01:16:07.455 --> 01:16:08.340
SAM: I'm going fast.

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.008
MATT: We'll say at that point, that'll get you
about to the edge of the board there.

01:16:11.008 --> 01:16:14.720
TALIESIN: Hey, you might be able to-- oh, you
burned your move, though.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.716
SAM: Where is Keg? Did I just run past Keg on my
way?

01:16:20.716 --> 01:16:21.481
ASHLY: I'm on a horse.

01:16:21.481 --> 01:16:23.889
MATT: Keg is going to be catching up to you at
this point.

01:16:23.889 --> 01:16:36.529
SAM: Can I hold my action until Keg gets in range?
You're on a horse?

01:16:36.529 --> 01:16:40.229
ASHLY: Yeah, I jumped on a horse. Before we rolled
initiative, real fast-like.

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:47.872
SAM: I'll hold my action until someone gets within
melee range of the thing, and then I will fire a crossbow.

01:16:47.872 --> 01:16:59.222
MATT: Okay. Got you. That ends Nott's turn. It's
now their turn. As one of them that previously

01:16:59.222 --> 01:17:01.878
killed Beau's horse--

01:17:01.878 --> 01:17:04.873
MARISHA: Rest in peace, Water Closet.

01:17:04.873 --> 01:17:08.018
MATT: To that side there. Another one bursts from
the ground--

01:17:08.018 --> 01:17:10.889
SAM: Aw, come on! This is not fair.

01:17:10.889 --> 01:17:20.058
MATT: --On this side, and skitters over this
direction. This one's going to move up to there.

01:17:20.504 --> 01:17:28.386
If your horse is there, it can't quite move to
that space, which is frustrating it. That's fine.

01:17:28.386 --> 01:17:34.755
It'll pull back a bit, then, and stay there.
Actually, no, because you killed the fourth one,

01:17:34.755 --> 01:17:41.698
so it's not present. As they all turn around and,
watching its one friend get cut down, they begin

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:49.806
to line up, all three of them pull back and its
pincers open as it releases this splashing stream

01:17:49.806 --> 01:17:57.036
of deep green-like liquid that sprays out in front
of it, for 30 feet, five foot wide.

01:17:57.036 --> 01:18:02.972
TALIESIN: This is not anything I can try and give
them disadvantage on?

01:18:02.972 --> 01:18:12.392
MATT: Nope, this is a saving throw scenario. I
need Molly and Caleb to make dexterity-- actually,

01:18:12.392 --> 01:18:16.683
for this one, it's just Molly and the horse,
because it doesn't quite get to Caleb on that one.

01:18:16.683 --> 01:18:20.244
TALIESIN: Dexterity saving throw?

01:18:20.244 --> 01:18:20.855
MATT: Yep.

01:18:20.855 --> 01:18:25.070
TALIESIN: Yay! That's a 22!

01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:31.229
MATT: Okay, so you take half damage. There you go.
You take seven points of acid damage.

01:18:31.784 --> 01:18:32.865
TALIESIN: I can live with that.

01:18:32.865 --> 01:18:41.700
MATT: As it streaks across your body. Your horse
does not make the saving throw. Your horse gets

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:47.232
sprayed on the side and makes a horrible, pained
neighing sound as it falls to the ground, its body

01:18:47.232 --> 01:18:48.877
now acidically burning away.

01:18:48.877 --> 01:18:50.327
TALIESIN: Loo! No!

01:18:50.327 --> 01:18:51.801
MATT: It's not surviving this.

01:18:51.801 --> 01:18:53.421
TALIESIN: That's the end of Loo.

01:18:53.421 --> 01:18:56.237
SAM: Now we're down to John, Crapper, and Toilet.

01:18:56.237 --> 01:19:00.913
MATT: This one right here is going to spray you as
well, Molly. Another dexterity saving throw, please.

01:19:00.922 --> 01:19:02.396
ASHLY: I really hope Toilet makes it.

01:19:05.426 --> 01:19:06.061
TALIESIN: 11.

01:19:06.061 --> 01:19:14.362
MATT: 11 does not succeed. You suffer 14 points of
acid damage as another stream blasts into your

01:19:14.362 --> 01:19:19.431
back and shoulder, burning through your flesh, and
the side of your face begins to pull away and

01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:27.517
smoke. Back here, this one is going to shoot in a
stream that hits Beau, Caleb, and the horse. I

01:19:27.517 --> 01:19:28.219
need you to--

01:19:28.219 --> 01:19:29.303
LIAM: Can I use my natural 20 now?

01:19:29.303 --> 01:19:31.443
MARISHA: Dex saves?

01:19:31.443 --> 01:19:32.522
MATT: Dex save, yes.

01:19:32.522 --> 01:19:34.748
LIAM: That time it's a three.

01:19:34.748 --> 01:19:36.876
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

01:19:36.876 --> 01:19:38.157
MATT: Your horse made it, though.

01:19:38.157 --> 01:19:40.790
MARISHA: Hey, Crapper!

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:53.420
MATT: That is 14 points of acid damage to both of
you. The horse takes seven. It's hurt, still

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.935
surviving. That's going to end their go. It's now
the horses' turn.

01:19:56.935 --> 01:19:59.252
SAM: The horses' turn?

01:19:59.252 --> 01:19:59.976
MATT: Yeah.

01:19:59.976 --> 01:20:01.542
ASHLY: I got worse initiative than the horse?

01:20:01.542 --> 01:20:05.774
MATT: This one's running. Yep. And it's going to
run off the battlefield there.

01:20:05.774 --> 01:20:07.087
SAM: Run, Crapper, run!

01:20:07.087 --> 01:20:07.918
MATT: He's dead.

01:20:07.918 --> 01:20:09.995
SAM: Run like the wind!

01:20:09.995 --> 01:20:15.087
MATT: All righty. That's going to end their go.
Caleb and Keg, you guys are up.

01:20:15.087 --> 01:20:16.764
LIAM: Oh, guests first.

01:20:16.764 --> 01:20:20.910
ASHLY: Oh, thank you. So how far can I go on this
horse?

01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:21.942
MATT: On horseback?

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:22.453
ASHLY: Yes.

01:20:22.453 --> 01:20:24.328
MATT: That's a fairly good distance speed of 60
feet.

01:20:24.328 --> 01:20:24.992
SAM: Wow.

01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:32.804
MATT: That'll get you up to... we'll say up to
there. Pretty much right to the edge of where that

01:20:32.804 --> 01:20:34.818
is there.

01:20:34.818 --> 01:20:36.799
ASHLY: So I can't get up on any of these boys?

01:20:36.799 --> 01:20:40.515
MATT: I'll say because a horse doesn't get any
attack on-- and it would normally get an action,

01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.945
I'll let the horse dash.

01:20:41.945 --> 01:20:42.536
ASHLY: Ey!

01:20:42.536 --> 01:20:43.429
SAM: That's nice.

01:20:43.429 --> 01:20:45.677
MATT: So that'll get you right up next to this
one.

01:20:45.677 --> 01:20:49.672
ASHLY: Okay. So can I leap off the horse and come
down with the axe?

01:20:49.672 --> 01:20:50.156
MARISHA: Yes!

01:20:50.156 --> 01:20:53.512
MATT: Yeah. Just for the hell of it, make an
acrobatics check for me.

01:20:53.512 --> 01:20:54.480
ASHLY: Okay! Why not?

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.724
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

01:20:55.724 --> 01:20:56.462
ASHLY: Natural 20.

01:20:56.462 --> 01:20:58.344
(cheering)

01:20:58.344 --> 01:20:59.889
SAM: That's like Cirque du Soleil shit.

01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:02.384
MATT: So as the horse is galloping, you watch--

01:21:02.384 --> 01:21:04.125
ASHLY: She goes like this.

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:08.450
MATT: You watch as Keg gets up on top, holding the
reins. (hoofbeats) Pulls the warhammer out and

01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:12.450
then at the right moment just leaps off while
pulling the battleaxe out, doing a flip in the

01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:17.515
air, landing and coming down with both weapons. Go
ahead and make your attacks on the opposite side

01:21:17.515 --> 01:21:18.153
of it.

01:21:18.153 --> 01:21:19.250
ASHLY: 17?

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:20.272
MATT: 17 hits.

01:21:20.272 --> 01:21:23.441
ASHLY: And then the other attack is an 18
naturally.

01:21:23.441 --> 01:21:27.156
MATT: Yeah, that hits. So go ahead and roll both
those damage.

01:21:27.156 --> 01:21:32.041
ASHLY: So that's six... and then help me do math,
12.

01:21:32.041 --> 01:21:32.894
MATT: Six and 12?

01:21:32.894 --> 01:21:33.425
ASHLY: Yeah.

01:21:33.425 --> 01:21:35.696
MATT: Nice. Still have your bonus action.

01:21:35.696 --> 01:21:37.140
ASHLY: So I get to attack again, right?

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:39.571
MATT: Yeah, because you're dual wielding. So you
attack, attack, and then attack.

01:21:39.571 --> 01:21:43.370
ASHLY: Eight plus seven. Does that hit?

01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:44.148
MATT: 15. Still hits.

01:21:44.148 --> 01:21:44.735
ASHLY: Hey!

01:21:44.735 --> 01:21:46.311
MATT: Yep. Armor class of...

01:21:46.311 --> 01:21:47.268
ASHLY: Nine.

01:21:47.268 --> 01:21:52.874
MATT: Nine points of damage. Oof! So as you come
down, both weapons (whack) clanging onto it, you

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:59.053
hear the armor crack from underneath and you watch
as its light green blood begin to seep through the

01:21:59.053 --> 01:22:06.413
wounds you left. As it turns around, this weird
clicking, sucking sound out of its face, you laugh--

01:22:06.413 --> 01:22:07.003
ASHLY: Shut up!

01:22:07.003 --> 01:22:11.159
MATT: --and slam it in the side of the face with
your warhammer. (screech) It pulls back and it's

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:13.287
now bleeding out of its jaw as it looks pretty
hurt.

01:22:13.287 --> 01:22:13.841
ASHLY: Nice.

01:22:13.841 --> 01:22:19.959
SAM: I will release my bolt. At disadvantage
because more than 30 feet away.

01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:21.067
MATT: It is, yes.

01:22:21.067 --> 01:22:22.486
SAM: (inhale through teeth) Ooh, that's only a
12.

01:22:22.486 --> 01:22:29.606
MATT: 12 misses, unfortunately. (ping) The bolt
streaks off-- actually, it hits the side of Keg's

01:22:29.606 --> 01:22:29.856
armor--

01:22:29.856 --> 01:22:30.522
ASHLY: Hey!

01:22:30.522 --> 01:22:31.449
MATT: Shearing off.

01:22:31.449 --> 01:22:33.848
SAM: Sorry, sorry! That's-- that's on me.

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:34.860
ASHLY: Who are you aiming for?

01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:35.599
SAM: I did not--

01:22:35.599 --> 01:22:36.754
ASHLY: It's nine feet tall!

01:22:36.754 --> 01:22:39.968
SAM: I'm sorry! I'm just drunk. I'm drunk, I'm day
drunk.

01:22:39.968 --> 01:22:42.190
TALIESIN: This is your perfect opportunity for
"New crossbow, who dis?"

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:43.562
(laughter)

01:22:43.562 --> 01:22:44.803
SAM: Oh yeah, I got a new crossbow.

01:22:44.803 --> 01:22:45.433
MATT: All right. Caleb, you're up.

01:22:45.433 --> 01:22:49.580
LIAM: Yeah. I go rummaging through my pack really
quick and I pull out a licorice root and stick it

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.838
into my mouth and bite onto and I start muttering
to myself and I say, "Pick up the pace," and I

01:22:53.838 --> 01:22:55.586
cast Haste on Beauregard.

01:22:55.586 --> 01:22:56.154
MATT: All righty.

01:22:56.154 --> 01:23:01.411
MARISHA: Aw, I hate licorice. (groaning) Why is
that taste in my mouth? That's weird.

01:23:01.411 --> 01:23:05.219
LIAM: And then I will move as far as I can towards
Nott.

01:23:05.219 --> 01:23:10.420
MATT: All right. So you are Hasted there. You're
going to move as far as you can to Nott.

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.209
LIAM: Towards Nott, ja.

01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:14.678
MATT: There you go.

01:23:14.678 --> 01:23:15.261
LIAM: Okay.

01:23:15.261 --> 01:23:18.141
MATT: That finishes your turn. Top of the round,
Beau you're up and hasted.

01:23:18.141 --> 01:23:21.594
MARISHA: (panting) I'm going to turn to this guy
and I'm going to lay into him.

01:23:21.594 --> 01:23:24.527
MATT: You step around the trunk of the tree.

01:23:24.527 --> 01:23:27.466
MARISHA: So that means, do I get three attacks?
Base attacks?

01:23:27.466 --> 01:23:29.109
MATT: You get three base attacks, correct.

01:23:29.109 --> 01:23:29.616
TALIESIN: Woo.

01:23:29.616 --> 01:23:32.037
MATT: (singing) Haste. (hits)

01:23:32.037 --> 01:23:33.190
MARISHA: (hits) First one!

01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:34.551
LIAM: Advantage on dex saves too.

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:36.203
MARISHA: And advantage on dex saves. 15.

01:23:36.203 --> 01:23:37.928
MATT: That hits.

01:23:37.928 --> 01:23:39.157
TALIESIN: It will come in handy with these--

01:23:39.157 --> 01:23:39.738
LIAM: Yes.

01:23:39.738 --> 01:23:48.287
MARISHA: That is... nine damage. Nine! Second one.
Ooh. Yeah, yeah. that's 16.

01:23:48.287 --> 01:23:49.725
MATT: All righty.

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:54.310
MARISHA: And that is... 11 damage.

01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:56.519
MATT: Nice. Third strike.

01:23:56.519 --> 01:23:59.334
MARISHA: That's a natural 14.

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:00.548
MATT: Yep, that'll hit.

01:24:00.548 --> 01:24:01.553
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:24:01.553 --> 01:24:04.844
MARISHA: Okay. Seven damage.

01:24:04.844 --> 01:24:08.295
MATT: Seven points of damage on that, fantastic.
And you still have your bonus.

01:24:08.295 --> 01:24:14.234
MARISHA: Yep and I'm going to spend a ki point
again to do flurry of blows and get two more attacks.

01:24:14.951 --> 01:24:15.521
MATT: Two more attacks.

01:24:15.521 --> 01:24:16.693
(cheering)

01:24:16.693 --> 01:24:20.342
MATT: Hasted monks. (blows) Just full on Wang
Chung over here.

01:24:20.342 --> 01:24:24.169
MARISHA: Mm. One's a natural 19, the other's a
two.

01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:27.806
MATT: So you do get one more hit. So roll damage
for that.

01:24:27.806 --> 01:24:28.381
LIAM: Get it.

01:24:28.381 --> 01:24:31.153
MARISHA: Aw, yeah! 11 damage.

01:24:31.153 --> 01:24:32.263
MATT: 11 damage.

01:24:32.263 --> 01:24:36.098
MARISHA: No, ten damage. Sorry.

01:24:36.098 --> 01:24:37.557
MATT: That's okay.

01:24:39.297 --> 01:24:40.397
LIAM: Right in the ball sack.

01:24:40.397 --> 01:24:41.142
MARISHA: Is he dead?

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.112
MATT: That'll do it.

01:24:42.112 --> 01:24:43.406
MARISHA: Is he dead?

01:24:43.406 --> 01:24:44.066
(cheering)

01:24:44.066 --> 01:24:47.009
MATT: You just spin around, the adrenaline pumping
through your veins from Caleb's spell instilling

01:24:47.009 --> 01:24:54.721
you with unnatural speed. You rush forward and
just (hits) and just do the fastest full on combo.

01:24:54.721 --> 01:24:59.962
You watch as she basically pummels this giant nine
foot insect creature into submission.

01:24:59.962 --> 01:25:01.767
MARISHA: (hits)

01:25:01.767 --> 01:25:05.404
MATT: It falls to the ground as you're just
pummelling its face until it eventually collapses

01:25:05.404 --> 01:25:08.633
and sputters out the remaining breath before it
stops moving.

01:25:08.633 --> 01:25:10.576
LIAM: Street Fighter combo.

01:25:10.576 --> 01:25:11.382
TALIESIN: Epic combo.

01:25:11.382 --> 01:25:14.366
MATT: Fantastic. You still have...

01:25:14.366 --> 01:25:15.696
MARISHA: Oh, movement!

01:25:15.696 --> 01:25:17.034
MATT: 75 feet of movement.

01:25:17.034 --> 01:25:17.783
SAM: Oh wow.

01:25:17.783 --> 01:25:18.810
ASHLY: Holy cow.

01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:19.822
SAM: Because you're fast.

01:25:19.822 --> 01:25:21.058
MATT: Because you're hasted.

01:25:21.058 --> 01:25:22.350
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:23.176
TALIESIN: It's a fresh one.

01:25:23.176 --> 01:25:31.289
MARISHA: I am going to make my way behind this
guy... if I can.

01:25:31.289 --> 01:25:32.395
MATT: Oh, yeah.

01:25:32.395 --> 01:25:33.554
SAM: (car zoom)

01:25:33.554 --> 01:25:34.274
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:25:34.274 --> 01:25:34.770
LIAM: Wow.

01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:36.928
MATT: You go around the tree and then tap it on
the shoulder.

01:25:36.928 --> 01:25:40.455
TALIESIN: Circle the tree a couple times, holding
onto it.

01:25:40.455 --> 01:25:41.474
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:25:41.474 --> 01:25:42.136
MATT: Just to be a dick.

01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:43.760
MARISHA: (singing) Singing in the rain.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.264
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn, Beau?

01:25:45.264 --> 01:25:45.816
MARISHA: Yes.

01:25:45.816 --> 01:25:47.010
MATT: All right. Molly, you're up next.

01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:50.813
TALIESIN: I'm going to run and get into flanking
position with this one over here.

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:51.609
MATT: All righty.

01:25:51.609 --> 01:25:54.227
TALIESIN: Thumpety, thumpety.

01:25:54.915 --> 01:25:55.892
MATT: So move over and push into this space--

01:25:55.892 --> 01:25:56.581
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:25:56.581 --> 01:25:58.227
MATT: Because it's an ally, I'll let you move into
the horse's space there.

01:25:58.227 --> 01:26:08.500
TALIESIN: And now we're going to take a slice at
this one. And that's... that'll do it. (counting)

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.428
25 to hit.

01:26:09.428 --> 01:26:10.223
MATT: That'll hit.

01:26:10.223 --> 01:26:15.411
TALIESIN: So. (counting) Ten plus four, 14.

01:26:15.756 --> 01:26:17.430
MATT: 14 points of damage, nice.

01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:24.830
TALIESIN: And again. 19 and a one.

01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:25.935
MATT: That'll hit.

01:26:25.935 --> 01:26:27.215
TALIESIN: Why I love advantage.

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:29.471
MATT: Advantage is nice.

01:26:29.471 --> 01:26:32.172
TALIESIN: And that's... 14 points of damage.

01:26:32.778 --> 01:26:33.511
SAM: Wow.

01:26:33.511 --> 01:26:34.180
ASHLY and MATT: Ooh.

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:35.093
MATT: All right.

01:26:35.093 --> 01:26:36.742
TALIESIN: It's got to be dead by now, right?

01:26:36.742 --> 01:26:37.933
MATT: No, it's still alive.

01:26:37.933 --> 01:26:39.244
(groans)

01:26:39.244 --> 01:26:40.612
TALIESIN: How is that-- the one that... really?

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:41.579
MATT: That one hadn't taken any damage.

01:26:41.579 --> 01:26:42.059
TALIESIN: It had!

01:26:42.059 --> 01:26:45.338
MATT: Oh wait, no! Oh sorry. I was writing that
down under the wrong one.

01:26:45.338 --> 01:26:48.735
TALIESIN: (explosions, screeching)

01:26:48.735 --> 01:26:51.725
MATT: My apologies. Yes, it is dead.

01:26:51.725 --> 01:26:52.996
ASHLY: (laughter)

01:26:52.996 --> 01:26:58.395
MATT: I was writing it under the wrong one. So as
you dart off behind, the first two strikes you

01:26:58.395 --> 01:27:03.847
unleash carve it into two pieces. You watch as the
creature, as it's turning around to hiss and rear

01:27:03.847 --> 01:27:09.316
back, its pincers about to carve into your face,
you watch as the head just rolls off of its body

01:27:09.316 --> 01:27:11.900
and there behind you see Molly standing there with
the blades out.

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:12.331
ASHLY: Whoa.

01:27:12.331 --> 01:27:16.515
TALIESIN: I needed this. And I'm going to hide
behind the tree trunk from the other one.

01:27:16.515 --> 01:27:18.358
MATT: Okay, you're going to-- right there?

01:27:18.358 --> 01:27:19.677
TALIESIN: Last of my movement. Yeah.

01:27:19.677 --> 01:27:23.782
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go, Molly. Nott,
you're up.

01:27:23.782 --> 01:27:29.856
SAM: I'll move within range, crossbow bolt range.
You know what?

01:27:29.856 --> 01:27:31.938
MATT: The inner range is what?

01:27:31.938 --> 01:27:32.705
SAM: 30.

01:27:32.705 --> 01:27:34.865
MATT: It's just out of your 30 range.

01:27:34.865 --> 01:27:43.735
SAM: No, you know what? I'll stay put and I will
cast... I will cast Silent Image in a flanking

01:27:43.735 --> 01:27:52.400
position to Beau. And I will create a second Beau
just standing there in front of the creature and

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.171
try to help Beau.

01:27:54.171 --> 01:27:55.191
MATT: So mysteriously...

01:27:55.191 --> 01:27:57.759
MARISHA: It's a different color palette? Color
palette swaps.

01:27:57.759 --> 01:27:59.119
TALIESIN: It's Street Fighter-style.

01:27:59.119 --> 01:27:59.741
SAM: Yeah.

01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:01.824
TALIESIN: Beau and Ken.

01:28:01.824 --> 01:28:06.772
(laughter)

01:28:06.772 --> 01:28:11.781
MATT: Perfect. All right, so. As the image of Beau
appears before, just standing there quietly

01:28:11.781 --> 01:28:13.546
shifting, holding its space.

01:28:13.546 --> 01:28:16.937
SAM: And I'll bonus action hide, just behind that
little--

01:28:16.937 --> 01:28:19.858
MATT: You can use your movement to go behind and
then hide if you want to.

01:28:19.858 --> 01:28:20.451
SAM: Sure, great.

01:28:20.451 --> 01:28:21.568
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a stealth
check.

01:28:21.568 --> 01:28:23.932
SAM: Natural 20.

01:28:23.932 --> 01:28:25.249
(cheering)

01:28:25.249 --> 01:28:27.372
TALIESIN: Oh! This is cool.

01:28:27.372 --> 01:28:30.578
MATT: You teleport through campaigns. You're
somehow in campaign one.

01:28:30.578 --> 01:28:32.848
SAM: Great. Ooh.

01:28:32.848 --> 01:28:34.089
MATT: All right. That finishes Nott's turn.

01:28:34.089 --> 01:28:37.734
SAM: It's not as emotionally deep as this one.

01:28:37.734 --> 01:28:40.593
TALIESIN: Give it time, give it time.

01:28:40.593 --> 01:28:42.127
MATT: All right.

01:28:42.127 --> 01:28:43.298
TALIESIN: Nice patronus, by the way.

01:28:43.298 --> 01:28:43.841
LIAM: Time travel too far.

01:28:43.841 --> 01:28:44.495
SAM: Yep.

01:28:44.495 --> 01:28:49.701
MATT: So it's now that guy's turn. Currently
surrounded by Beaus--

01:28:49.701 --> 01:28:52.170
TALIESIN: Too many Beaus.

01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:57.194
MATT: Too many Beaus. It's going to go ahead and
see if it can gather which one is the real threat.

01:28:57.194 --> 01:29:03.742
Rolls a natural 19. So even with its low
intelligence, it can discern the nature of which--

01:29:03.742 --> 01:29:05.782
TALIESIN: That palette swap's terrible.

01:29:05.782 --> 01:29:07.465
(laughter)

01:29:07.465 --> 01:29:11.990
MATT: Really? Puce? It's going to go ahead and
make a bite attack towards you, Beau.

01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.609
MARISHA: Okay.

01:29:12.609 --> 01:29:15.236
MATT: That is going to be a 12 to hit?

01:29:15.236 --> 01:29:15.802
MARISHA: Miss.

01:29:15.802 --> 01:29:20.358
MATT: Yeah. It just reaches out with its pincers.
You manage to go ahead and duck out of the side

01:29:20.358 --> 01:29:27.872
and slam your bo into it, causing it to just
completely miss you. It rears back. It does not

01:29:27.872 --> 01:29:31.000
regain its acid spray and that's its turn.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.501
SAM: Wow. That's great.

01:29:32.501 --> 01:29:40.548
MATT: Both horses just go running off the board
into the fray. Or away from the fray.

01:29:41.073 --> 01:29:42.633
TALIESIN: We have oats, they'll come back.

01:29:42.633 --> 01:29:43.768
SAM: Maybe.

01:29:43.768 --> 01:29:46.587
MATT: All right, that brings us to Keg.

01:29:46.587 --> 01:29:50.036
ASHLY: Can I get there with the 25 feet speed?

01:29:50.036 --> 01:29:52.959
MATT: You can.

01:29:52.959 --> 01:29:55.072
ASHLY: Delightful. I'm going to smack him.

01:29:55.072 --> 01:29:56.154
SAM: Nope.

01:29:56.154 --> 01:29:58.673
ASHLY: I won't smack him. I'll try again to smack
him.

01:29:58.673 --> 01:29:59.143
SAM: Ooh.

01:29:59.143 --> 01:30:04.339
ASHLY: I will smack him. And then I'm going to do
nine damage to that boy.

01:30:04.339 --> 01:30:05.504
MATT: Nine damage to that one.

01:30:05.504 --> 01:30:10.040
ASHLY: As a bonus action, I'll smack him again. I
will smack him, and then I'll smack him one more

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.667
time, and that's going to be seven damage.

01:30:11.667 --> 01:30:17.817
MATT: Seven points of damage. The first one swings
wide, no impact. The second one slams as a

01:30:17.817 --> 01:30:21.077
backhand into its armor, causing it to crack.
Using that opening, you pull back with your

01:30:21.077 --> 01:30:24.893
battleaxe and jam it into the wound, carving in
deeper. It's looking pretty hurt, but it's still

01:30:24.893 --> 01:30:26.980
standing. Anything else you wanted to do in your
turn?

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.866
ASHLY: No, I'm going to hang.

01:30:29.866 --> 01:30:30.586
MATT: You're going to hang back?

01:30:30.586 --> 01:30:32.802
SAM: You're going to keg stand there?

01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:38.638
ASHLY: I'm going to keg stand there. I'm proud of
you, Sam.

01:30:38.638 --> 01:30:44.975
MATT: That's what happens when you get Emmy award
winners at the table. You get that.

01:30:44.975 --> 01:30:47.209
ASHLY: That's the height that we can accomplish
though.

01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:50.660
MATT: Yeah, that's about it. You've peaked at this
point, we're done after this. It's all downhill.

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:55.040
SAM: There's horses around, there might be a pony
keg at some point, I don't know. We're going to

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:55.689
work on it.

01:30:55.689 --> 01:30:59.204
MATT: We'll work on it. That ends your go, Keg.
Caleb, you're up.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:04.103
LIAM: I feel the wind and then shoot three Magic
Missiles out of my hand at the thing.

01:31:04.529 --> 01:31:10.106
MATT: As you finish your attacks, you glance over
your shoulder as you hear this sound. You look in

01:31:10.106 --> 01:31:15.095
the distance; you see Caleb-- who at this point
has been this dirty hobo in the background-- all

01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:21.044
of a sudden, fire these three mystical arcane
missiles that glow and arc off anime-missile

01:31:21.044 --> 01:31:25.432
style, through the woods, avoiding trees, and all
three slamming into the sides of this creature. Go

01:31:25.432 --> 01:31:26.794
ahead and roll damage.

01:31:26.794 --> 01:31:37.286
LIAM: That's a four and also (counting) six-- I've
got to change this dice, that is a ten total.

01:31:37.286 --> 01:31:44.223
MATT: Ten total. (multiple impacts) It sits there
for a second after the impact, leaving these large

01:31:44.223 --> 01:31:49.800
craters in the side of its chitinous armor where
it's cracked and bits of liquid are spilling out

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.877
of it. It looks heavily wounded, but it's still
alive.

01:31:51.877 --> 01:31:53.626
LIAM: Was ist los?

01:31:53.626 --> 01:31:55.021
MATT: You're going to stay where you're put?

01:31:55.021 --> 01:31:57.563
LIAM: I will go crouch by Nott.

01:31:57.563 --> 01:32:00.123
MATT: Revealing her position.

01:32:00.123 --> 01:32:02.108
SAM: Hey! Get away from me! No!

01:32:02.108 --> 01:32:04.839
LIAM: I didn't make any noise. I just sit down.

01:32:04.839 --> 01:32:07.722
MATT: That's all good. That finishes Caleb's go.
Beau, you're up.

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:11.581
MARISHA: First attack. 14.

01:32:11.581 --> 01:32:13.298
MATT: That just hits.

01:32:13.298 --> 01:32:19.983
MARISHA: Wait, no, 13. Sorry, my math is wonky
today. That doesn't hit, does it?

01:32:19.983 --> 01:32:21.106
MATT: 13 does not hit.

01:32:21.106 --> 01:32:23.308
SAM: There's no advantage because my Silent Image
is there?

01:32:23.308 --> 01:32:27.609
MATT: Unfortunately, no. Nothing is actually
flanking it.

01:32:27.609 --> 01:32:31.415
MARISHA: Second attack. That hits, that's 18.

01:32:31.415 --> 01:32:32.169
MATT: 18 hits.

01:32:32.169 --> 01:32:41.352
MARISHA: That is-- what did I roll on that one? I
forgot. I don't know what it was. Sorry, 15 damage

01:32:41.352 --> 01:32:43.061
for the first one.

01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:44.465
MATT: 15 points of damage on the first hit?

01:32:44.465 --> 01:32:45.014
MARISHA: Yes.

01:32:45.014 --> 01:32:51.821
MATT: Beau, how do you want to do this? As you and
Keg are both there clamoring on two sides of it,

01:32:51.821 --> 01:32:54.558
the image of yourself on the opposite end, what do
you want to do?

01:32:54.558 --> 01:33:00.268
MARISHA: As I see Keg bash it in a little bit of
its insect armor, I take my staff and I get up

01:33:00.268 --> 01:33:07.188
under its exoskeleton and I start prying it off
and I punch it to death.

01:33:07.188 --> 01:33:18.333
MATT: As you crowbar off a large part of its
exterior insectoid armor skeleton, it exposes this

01:33:18.333 --> 01:33:26.111
horrible yellowish, sinewy muscle interior as all
the striations are pulling off of the armor. As

01:33:26.111 --> 01:33:34.137
it's exposed, it tries to go in to protect itself,
but you're too quick, and you zero in and plunge

01:33:34.137 --> 01:33:41.626
your fist into its body as it falls to the ground
with a horrible sucking, guttural, slimy death and

01:33:41.626 --> 01:33:42.798
pull it out.

01:33:42.798 --> 01:33:45.712
TALIESIN: If you squeeze and twist, you can make
it stand up again and you can make the arms move.

01:33:45.712 --> 01:33:48.009
MATT: Technically--

01:33:48.009 --> 01:33:49.858
LIAM: (singing) Hello my baby!

01:33:49.858 --> 01:33:53.303
ASHLY: You guys nasty, I like it.

01:33:53.303 --> 01:33:55.807
MARISHA: Does anybody have a Wet-Nap?

01:33:55.807 --> 01:33:58.807
TALIESIN: Use the ground.

01:33:58.807 --> 01:34:01.865
SAM: I'm going to take off running after the
horses to see if I can catch up with them.

01:34:01.865 --> 01:34:02.558
MATT: Okay.

01:34:02.558 --> 01:34:04.669
MARISHA: Please check on Water Closet!

01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:09.591
TALIESIN: This is a dead horse or can it be
revived?

01:34:09.591 --> 01:34:12.196
MATT: You can go ahead and make a medicine check.

01:34:12.196 --> 01:34:14.111
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a medicine check for
my horse.

01:34:14.111 --> 01:34:15.363
LIAM: Does it have Jester's shield on it?

01:34:15.363 --> 01:34:18.833
SAM: Didn't we leave the shield?

01:34:18.833 --> 01:34:20.732
MATT: No, the shield was strapped onto one of the
horses.

01:34:20.732 --> 01:34:22.827
TALIESIN: My medicine check is nine.

01:34:22.827 --> 01:34:25.914
MATT: You're not sure but it looks dire.

01:34:25.914 --> 01:34:26.987
ASHLY: Can I check?

01:34:26.987 --> 01:34:30.732
MATT: Sure, if you want to go ahead and step up to
the horse. Make a medicine check.

01:34:30.732 --> 01:34:32.984
ASHLY: 13?

01:34:32.984 --> 01:34:41.085
MATT: Unless this horse gets some serious
treatment, it's done.

01:34:41.085 --> 01:34:42.319
LIAM: It's suffering, put it down.

01:34:42.319 --> 01:34:45.715
ASHLY: I take my axe and I slam it down on its
neck.

01:34:45.715 --> 01:34:48.057
MATT: Instantly mercy killed.

01:34:48.057 --> 01:34:49.554
TALIESIN: Neigh.

01:34:49.554 --> 01:34:56.066
MATT: Nott, you do manage to catch up to the other
horses. They didn't go full sprint into infinity.

01:34:56.066 --> 01:35:00.660
They slowed down and once they got a safe distance
from the action-- you manage to recover two of

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:05.923
them. There's still your horse by the house; you
still have three horses.

01:35:05.923 --> 01:35:07.052
MARISHA: Check Water Closet.

01:35:07.052 --> 01:35:10.597
SAM: John, Crapper, and Toilet. Water Closet's
dead.

01:35:10.597 --> 01:35:12.165
MARISHA: Oh, he's very dead.

01:35:12.165 --> 01:35:14.488
MATT: You can go check.

01:35:14.488 --> 01:35:18.584
TALIESIN: Water Closet is possibly new pocket
jerky at this point.

01:35:18.584 --> 01:35:22.960
SAM: We can go check Water Closet I guess?

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.835
MATT: Go ahead and make a medicine check as you
approach.

01:35:24.835 --> 01:35:27.667
SAM: That would be a three.

01:35:27.667 --> 01:35:34.131
MATT: Water Closet looks not long for this world.

01:35:34.131 --> 01:35:41.536
SAM: I'm going to try to cut out the tongue. Maybe
that's something I can eat later.

01:35:41.536 --> 01:35:46.285
MATT: Okay. Water Closet is still technically
holding onto life.

01:35:46.285 --> 01:35:49.104
SAM: Ugh. I don't know that.

01:35:49.104 --> 01:35:56.676
MATT: No. Water Closet's final horrible moment is
its riders cutting its tongue out.

01:35:56.676 --> 01:35:58.345
SAM: (sobbing)

01:35:58.345 --> 01:36:01.514
ASHLY: Why do you hang out with this guy-- lady.

01:36:01.514 --> 01:36:03.877
MARISHA: He came up with this one; they were a
package deal.

01:36:03.877 --> 01:36:05.823
ASHLY: Why do you hang out with it?

01:36:05.823 --> 01:36:08.285
LIAM: She is extremely useful.

01:36:08.285 --> 01:36:10.717
ASHLY: At cutting out horse tongues?

01:36:10.717 --> 01:36:12.177
SAM: (eating noises)

01:36:12.177 --> 01:36:13.618
LIAM: Among other things, yeah.

01:36:13.618 --> 01:36:18.569
ASHLY: That's the most fucked-up shit I've ever
seen, and I grew up in Shadycreek Run.

01:36:18.569 --> 01:36:24.003
MARISHA: We have three horses, and there's five of
us.

01:36:24.003 --> 01:36:24.536
MATT: Correct.

01:36:24.536 --> 01:36:25.971
MARISHA: Can we double up?

01:36:25.971 --> 01:36:28.472
MATT: It's possible.

01:36:28.472 --> 01:36:30.324
MARISHA: Nott doubles up with Caleb.

01:36:30.324 --> 01:36:32.727
SAM: Maybe the two smalls should--

01:36:32.727 --> 01:36:34.383
ASHLY: I'm not going on a horse with her.

01:36:34.383 --> 01:36:37.638
SAM: What? I've bonded with its essence now.

01:36:37.638 --> 01:36:40.072
ASHLY: I'm not going on a horse with her!

01:36:40.072 --> 01:36:42.641
TALIESIN: Keg can ride with me, this is not a
problem. If you want.

01:36:42.641 --> 01:36:43.512
ASHLY: Yeah, that's fine.

01:36:43.512 --> 01:36:44.817
SAM: I've got the booze.

01:36:44.817 --> 01:36:49.496
ASHLY: You know, for the first time in my life,
I'm willing to sacrifice booze--

01:36:49.496 --> 01:36:50.264
LIAM: Scared straight.

01:36:50.264 --> 01:36:54.066
ASHLY: Scared straight. You can take that shit on
the road.

01:36:54.066 --> 01:36:56.645
TALIESIN: You're already taking a good hard look
at your decisions. This is good.

01:36:56.645 --> 01:37:02.129
MATT: As you guys begin to try and work out your
arrangements and the horses, unfortunately, due to

01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:10.348
the heavy nature of your armor and the broad form
and heavy body of Keg, it looks like you won't be

01:37:10.348 --> 01:37:16.039
able to fit Keg and one other individual on a
horse. But there are other combinations that might work.

01:37:16.039 --> 01:37:17.650
MARISHA: Nott, team up with Caleb.

01:37:17.650 --> 01:37:19.666
TALIESIN: I'll ride with you then.

01:37:19.666 --> 01:37:20.661
SAM: Would that work?

01:37:20.661 --> 01:37:21.619
TALIESIN: You get your own horse.

01:37:21.619 --> 01:37:22.317
ASHLY: Ay.

01:37:22.317 --> 01:37:24.366
MARISHA: Can me and Molly team up?

01:37:24.366 --> 01:37:25.348
MATT: You and Molly can do it, yeah.

01:37:25.348 --> 01:37:25.858
MARISHA: Okay.

01:37:25.858 --> 01:37:27.820
TALIESIN: I have their armor.

01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:29.638
SAM: Wait, we have three-- yeah, okay.

01:37:29.638 --> 01:37:30.748
TALIESIN: Yeah, that'll do it.

01:37:30.748 --> 01:37:32.003
MATT: Keg's about as dense as two of you.

01:37:32.003 --> 01:37:32.872
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:37:32.872 --> 01:37:37.435
(laughter)

01:37:37.435 --> 01:37:43.982
SAM: I noticed back there that you were using your
hands and weapon stuff and things. You're not a

01:37:43.982 --> 01:37:46.020
healer or anything?

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.854
ASHLY: You cracked the case, my man.

01:37:48.854 --> 01:37:53.416
TALIESIN: Truly nothing escapes your astute
observation.

01:37:53.416 --> 01:37:59.013
SAM: You don't have any potions of healing or
anything that could maybe heal someone if anyone

01:37:59.013 --> 01:38:00.860
needing healing would--

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:01.568
ASHLY: Who needs healing?

01:38:01.568 --> 01:38:05.966
SAM: No one now, but in the future-- it's a
frequent occurrence for us.

01:38:05.966 --> 01:38:08.508
TALIESIN: Going to go back to that cabin and take
a short rest for a minute.

01:38:08.508 --> 01:38:10.375
SAM: Do any of us have any potions?

01:38:10.375 --> 01:38:11.871
MARISHA: I have a potion.

01:38:11.871 --> 01:38:17.815
LIAM: I have a potion. I start to look to see what
Jester's got inside the haversack other than the

01:38:17.815 --> 01:38:19.449
dodecahedron and our tent.

01:38:19.449 --> 01:38:21.951
MATT: Unless I am mistaken--

01:38:21.951 --> 01:38:27.007
SAM: She had a Greater Healing potion, however, I
don't know if she had that on her or kept it in

01:38:27.007 --> 01:38:27.493
the sack.

01:38:27.493 --> 01:38:28.643
TALIESIN: It would have been in the sack.

01:38:28.643 --> 01:38:30.231
LIAM: She had a Heroes' Feast in there, I think.

01:38:30.231 --> 01:38:34.639
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and check one element
of this because it will--

01:38:34.639 --> 01:38:37.829
SAM: I think we have her notebook in the locker.

01:38:37.829 --> 01:38:41.510
TALIESIN: Do you want me to go look at the
locker?

01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:42.827
MARISHA: Yeah, her notebook might even be--

01:38:42.827 --> 01:38:44.902
SAM: No, I felt around in there.

01:38:44.902 --> 01:38:46.256
MARISHA: Oh, it might be in the locker then.

01:38:46.256 --> 01:38:49.359
ASHLY: What time is it now, after all the
bug-battling?

01:38:49.359 --> 01:38:52.843
MATT: The battle was pretty quick. You still have
probably another hour and a half, two hours,

01:38:52.843 --> 01:38:53.599
before sundown.

01:38:53.599 --> 01:38:56.970
ASHLY: Of daylight? Is there anything to harvest
from those bugs?

01:38:56.970 --> 01:39:01.195
MATT: If you want to go ahead and take a shot at
trying--

01:39:01.195 --> 01:39:02.995
SAM: Did the light just change in here?

01:39:02.995 --> 01:39:03.464
MATT: Yeah.

01:39:03.464 --> 01:39:05.627
MARISHA: It was in battle mode, did you notice?

01:39:05.627 --> 01:39:07.902
ASHLY: Ooh, fancy!

01:39:07.902 --> 01:39:09.295
TALIESIN: Look at the fancy.

01:39:09.295 --> 01:39:11.239
SAM: The light is moving.

01:39:11.239 --> 01:39:13.486
MATT: New toys.

01:39:13.486 --> 01:39:15.396
TALIESIN and MARISHA: New toys.

01:39:15.396 --> 01:39:24.240
MATT: I've wanted to have a setup like that since
high school. And now I can.

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:24.815
MARISHA: 12.

01:39:24.815 --> 01:39:32.157
MATT: You've never encountered these creatures;
you don't have much of an understanding of their

01:39:32.157 --> 01:39:37.500
anatomy beyond the experience you had extracting
the aspects from them, which actually would give

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:43.622
you a little better idea of their physicality in
some places. Because you looked at their

01:39:43.622 --> 01:39:50.608
constitution and dexterity, I'll say that you know
that the tendons and some of the muscle sinew that

01:39:50.608 --> 01:39:54.667
they use in the inside of their body is very
strong and very tight and can be used as cording.

01:39:54.667 --> 01:40:00.579
It can be used for anything that would involve a
very strong piece of cord or rope.

01:40:00.579 --> 01:40:04.551
MARISHA: What about their acidic venom situation,
their venom sacs?

01:40:04.551 --> 01:40:06.122
LIAM: Caleb comes up behind.

01:40:06.122 --> 01:40:10.814
MATT: That could possibly be harvested. It's a
dangerous process, you can certainly try.

01:40:10.814 --> 01:40:12.565
MARISHA: Like I might die trying?

01:40:12.565 --> 01:40:17.679
MATT: I don't know, you can certainly try. It's
trying to carefully remove a giant sac of natural

01:40:17.679 --> 01:40:22.466
acid from a creature's body. You want to roll the
dice?

01:40:22.466 --> 01:40:25.642
TALIESIN: Are you feeling lucky, punk?

01:40:25.642 --> 01:40:29.942
LIAM: Hold on. Here, there's the dodecahedron.

01:40:29.942 --> 01:40:30.584
MARISHA: Okay.

01:40:30.584 --> 01:40:35.839
MATT: All right. Well, you have to pull it out.
You have to remove it.

01:40:35.839 --> 01:40:36.555
MARISHA: I did.

01:40:36.555 --> 01:40:37.825
SAM: Just stare back.

01:40:37.825 --> 01:40:44.679
MATT: You watch as they pull this pack out and
Beau, reaching in, pulls out this strange,

01:40:44.679 --> 01:40:57.021
12-sided construction. It looks like it's some
sort of an opaque crystal, almost like a marble

01:40:57.021 --> 01:41:03.269
type of color. It's grayish and it's undulating
with some slight pulsing light, like a faint

01:41:03.269 --> 01:41:08.059
heartbeat, with these golden handles affixed to
it. As she pulls it out and begins to focus on it,

01:41:08.059 --> 01:41:13.787
there's this moment of distant meditation before
she comes back with a breath and places it back

01:41:13.787 --> 01:41:15.854
in. It's a strange sight.

01:41:15.854 --> 01:41:17.374
ASHLY: You're all into some freaky shit.

01:41:17.374 --> 01:41:18.824
LIAM: Made by gnomes.

01:41:18.824 --> 01:41:19.632
MARISHA: Okay.

01:41:19.632 --> 01:41:23.593
MATT: Do you have a blade to harvest?

01:41:26.823 --> 01:41:28.603
LIAM: I have a dagger. Here, use mine.

01:41:28.603 --> 01:41:30.088
MARISHA: I do have a dagger.

01:41:30.088 --> 01:41:34.100
LIAM: I shoot out the globules of light to float
around the corpse.

01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:36.738
MARISHA: And I put my goggles on. Safety first.

01:41:36.738 --> 01:41:38.837
LIAM: It's very bright. Super bright.

01:41:38.837 --> 01:41:40.350
MATT: Super bright right now.

01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:49.546
MARISHA: Pull up the hood and I buckle myself up.
I take my scarf from around my waist and tie it

01:41:49.851 --> 01:41:51.243
around me for a facemask.

01:41:51.243 --> 01:41:53.944
LIAM: You can do this, and I walk twenty feet
back.

01:41:53.944 --> 01:42:03.793
MATT: I will say, because of your understanding of
its body from extracting the aspects of it, do you

01:42:03.793 --> 01:42:12.371
wish to utilize nature or medicine for this roll?
Giving you the choice.

01:42:12.371 --> 01:42:14.991
MARISHA: Medicine, it's higher.

01:42:14.991 --> 01:42:17.936
MATT: Go ahead and make your check.

01:42:17.936 --> 01:42:19.449
MARISHA: Just a straight check?

01:42:19.449 --> 01:42:23.639
MATT: Just a straight check. Skill check with
medicine bonus, whatever that may be.

01:42:23.639 --> 01:42:26.617
MARISHA: Natural 20!

01:42:26.617 --> 01:42:28.606
ASHLY and TALIESIN: Whoa!

01:42:28.606 --> 01:42:29.420
TALIESIN: Finally!

01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:31.638
MARISHA: I'm back!

01:42:31.638 --> 01:42:37.890
MATT: You've seen Beau be pretty precise in combat
and pinpointing the weak elements of an opponent's

01:42:37.890 --> 01:42:45.967
body. This is almost poetry. The surgical
precision in which Beauregard takes the dagger and

01:42:45.967 --> 01:42:52.612
cuts, pulls, rips, pulls and lifts. Tucks, finds,
cuts, removes, and within a matter of about a

01:42:52.612 --> 01:43:00.684
minute, a minute and a half, there is a sac about
the size of a basketball-- the ends have been tied

01:43:00.684 --> 01:43:04.210
off and feels like a water balloon.

01:43:04.210 --> 01:43:05.326
ASHLY: Keg is aroused.

01:43:05.326 --> 01:43:14.217
MARISHA: Got the sac, now what? Do you have any
more flasks or anything to put it in?

01:43:14.217 --> 01:43:20.755
SAM: I have a couple of empty vials, but they're
small. I've worked with chemicals before, I could

01:43:20.755 --> 01:43:25.171
try to put this acid in the vials and stopper
them.

01:43:25.171 --> 01:43:30.074
MARISHA: If we poke-- if you have a little tube or
something that is straw, a little bamboo straw,

01:43:30.074 --> 01:43:32.506
put it in there, and go down?

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:36.303
SAM: Sure. Would three vials of acid be useful to
us?

01:43:36.303 --> 01:43:39.369
MARISHA: I think it would be useful to you for
sure.

01:43:39.369 --> 01:43:46.998
SAM: Sure, all right. I'll try to make a little
needle prick in the bladder and try to pour them

01:43:46.998 --> 01:43:49.753
into these vials that I got from The Gentleman.

01:43:49.753 --> 01:43:52.473
MARISHA: Can I help with my natural 20?

01:43:52.473 --> 01:43:55.978
MATT: Make a dexterity check, just a straight
dexterity check.

01:43:56.479 --> 01:43:59.514
SAM: Okay. That's 16.

01:43:59.514 --> 01:44:08.258
MATT: That's good. You do not just puncture a
balloon while looking directly at it. You manage

01:44:08.258 --> 01:44:14.312
to find one of the areas that taper within this
organ, whatever it is that was removed, and manage

01:44:14.312 --> 01:44:19.686
to siphon it off in a way where you can fill the
rest of your vials, however many empty vials you have.

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:20.935
SAM: I have three from The Gentleman.

01:44:20.935 --> 01:44:23.226
MATT: Yeah. You have three vials of acid now.

01:44:23.226 --> 01:44:27.989
SAM: Okay. Great. Would you like one? You did
this.

01:44:27.989 --> 01:44:32.283
MARISHA: I think they're better to be used on your
bolts and things like that.

01:44:32.283 --> 01:44:34.330
SAM: I don't know how I would put it on there.

01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:35.817
MARISHA: Can't he--?

01:44:35.817 --> 01:44:42.580
MATT: It's more of a tossed weapon or used to
dissolve things.

01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:43.485
SAM: Why don't you take one?

01:44:43.485 --> 01:44:44.393
MARISHA: All right, I'll take one.

01:44:44.393 --> 01:44:46.949
SAM: Molly, do you want some acid? Do you want to
drop some acid?

01:44:46.949 --> 01:44:51.002
TALIESIN: I feel like if you give it to me, I'm
going to end up dropping it and it's not really

01:44:51.002 --> 01:44:52.090
going to be that useful.

01:44:52.090 --> 01:44:53.159
SAM: Caleb, do you want--?

01:44:53.159 --> 01:44:55.321
LIAM: You're far more dexterous than I.

01:44:55.321 --> 01:44:59.070
SAM: How about I'll give you two, and I'll keep
one since I already have one that I made.

01:44:59.070 --> 01:45:00.522
ASHLY: You didn't ask me if I wanted some acid.

01:45:00.522 --> 01:45:01.408
LIAM: Are you dexterous?

01:45:01.408 --> 01:45:02.149
ASHLY: Yeah?

01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:05.088
LIAM: Show us.

01:45:05.088 --> 01:45:09.151
ASHLY: 15. I do a back flip, I don't know.

01:45:09.151 --> 01:45:13.882
(laughter)

01:45:13.882 --> 01:45:15.085
ASHLY: It's acrobatics, but fuck it.

01:45:15.085 --> 01:45:16.498
LIAM: I'd say she earned one, yeah?

01:45:16.498 --> 01:45:18.176
SAM: All right. Here you go.

01:45:18.176 --> 01:45:19.090
ASHLY: Thank you.

01:45:19.090 --> 01:45:20.477
SAM: Are we friends again?

01:45:20.477 --> 01:45:21.488
ASHLY: Were we ever?

01:45:21.488 --> 01:45:25.998
(laughter)

01:45:25.998 --> 01:45:28.103
TALIESIN: I'm very happy.

01:45:28.103 --> 01:45:33.194
MATT: You guys have taken a short time-- it's
taken about half an hour or so for you to go

01:45:33.309 --> 01:45:36.481
through this process of extracting that and
carefully filling these vials and discussing

01:45:36.481 --> 01:45:40.206
amongst yourselves who would get what. You have
about an hour until dusk hits.

01:45:40.206 --> 01:45:48.440
TALIESIN: I say we just camp at the house, at this
point. I need rest and we have... Not going to get

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:49.257
much further.

01:45:49.257 --> 01:45:50.798
MARISHA: It's fine with me. You guys fine with
that?

01:45:50.798 --> 01:45:53.832
LIAM: Short rest, you said? Sorry, was reading my
book.

01:45:53.832 --> 01:45:56.962
TALIESIN: I say we wake up early. It's going to be
dusk in less than an hour.

01:45:56.962 --> 01:45:59.369
ASHLY: The house feels a little exposed to me.

01:45:59.369 --> 01:45:59.992
TALIESIN: Well...

01:45:59.992 --> 01:46:05.114
ASHLY: Plus all the weird buggy guys were around
there. If there are more, they would come back.

01:46:05.114 --> 01:46:09.853
LIAM: I'm sorry, did we get any horses? Just
enough to fit us all on, condensed, right.

01:46:09.853 --> 01:46:11.042
SAM: What time is it? Sorry.

01:46:11.042 --> 01:46:12.503
MATT: About an hour until dusk.

01:46:12.503 --> 01:46:19.655
SAM: Oh, well, we can make some more headway on
the road and then go at full dark. We could camp

01:46:19.655 --> 01:46:20.543
at full dark.

01:46:20.543 --> 01:46:22.431
TALIESIN: Wherever we happen to find ourselves.

01:46:22.431 --> 01:46:26.400
ASHLY: Are we within range of the forests?

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:31.508
MATT: Yes, about here is where the forest begins,
and that is where you began your confrontation.

01:46:31.508 --> 01:46:33.410
You're right on the edge of the forest.

01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:36.234
LIAM: I think we should continue to make time as
well.

01:46:36.234 --> 01:46:45.469
MARISHA: Okay. Can I climb a tree and do I see
anything on the horizon in where we're going, like

01:46:45.469 --> 01:46:48.470
another tree clearing that looks like it might be
up ahead?

01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:49.878
MATT: Make an athletics check.

01:46:49.878 --> 01:46:50.999
MARISHA: Athletics?

01:46:50.999 --> 01:46:51.462
MATT: Yes.

01:46:53.192 --> 01:46:54.670
MARISHA: 24.

01:46:54.670 --> 01:46:55.484
SAM: Jesus.

01:46:55.484 --> 01:46:56.048
MARISHA: Rolled an 18.

01:46:56.048 --> 01:47:04.410
MATT: Like a monkey that was raised in the jungle,
you watch Beauregard leap from branch to bough,

01:47:04.410 --> 01:47:09.548
effortlessly diving through this forest.

01:47:09.548 --> 01:47:10.506
ASHLY: Keg is aroused.

01:47:10.506 --> 01:47:15.401
MARISHA: Whatever you cast on me, Caleb, is
like... I feel so good!

01:47:15.401 --> 01:47:16.652
MATT and LIAM: It's gone.

01:47:16.652 --> 01:47:19.692
MARISHA: But the lingering effects, you know, I'm
in the afterglow!

01:47:19.692 --> 01:47:22.447
MATT: The afterglow of Haste.

01:47:22.447 --> 01:47:24.802
TALIESIN: It was just tea. We just gave you tea to
smoke, it wasn't really...

01:47:24.802 --> 01:47:27.613
(laughter)

01:47:27.613 --> 01:47:29.270
TALIESIN: Herbal tea, man. Just chamomile tea.

01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:31.044
MARISHA: So relaxed.

01:47:31.044 --> 01:47:35.130
MATT: You make it up into the canopy. Make a
perception check.

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:41.833
MARISHA: Okay. 17.

01:47:41.833 --> 01:47:48.247
MATT: Even at the tallest tree, most around you,
all you can see are other trees of varying

01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:54.728
heights. Looking in the northeast direction,
beyond where you just came from, you can see the

01:47:54.728 --> 01:48:03.777
house, you can see bits of natural rock that maybe
had either been left by some long-ago volcanic

01:48:03.777 --> 01:48:10.612
detonation in the distance, or pushed up through
the ground by tectonic movement, you're not sure.

01:48:10.612 --> 01:48:16.020
You see elements of stone that have broken through
bits of the grass and open fields, part of the

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:21.374
natural fields here. You haven't actually traveled
this far north, so it's unfamiliar topography to

01:48:21.374 --> 01:48:25.775
you-- you've only heard about it-- but it's
interesting to see that the further north you get,

01:48:25.775 --> 01:48:31.198
the more rocky the terrain seems to get in the
direction you're traveling. You do see, far in the

01:48:31.198 --> 01:48:36.378
distance, what could possibly be the road that
you're getting to, but it's a ways off to get to

01:48:36.378 --> 01:48:37.174
that direction.

01:48:37.174 --> 01:48:43.870
MARISHA: I climb back down. I say we gather some
branches, some scrap wood for firewood, in case

01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:50.079
this might be the only forest we come across in a
while. See as far as we can get, maybe we can hide

01:48:50.079 --> 01:48:51.989
under a rock for shelter or something.

01:48:51.989 --> 01:48:54.381
TALIESIN: I've still got my tent, so, sure.

01:48:54.381 --> 01:48:56.130
MARISHA: I shoved one in the haversack too.

01:48:56.130 --> 01:48:56.875
TALIESIN: All right.

01:48:56.875 --> 01:49:00.135
MATT: You guys continue for the next hour or so,
skirting along the forest.

01:49:00.135 --> 01:49:01.344
MARISHA: I gathered some stuff.

01:49:01.344 --> 01:49:05.490
LIAM: As they leave, Caleb scooches Frumpkin on
the head and says: You know, she always forgets

01:49:05.490 --> 01:49:08.807
about you, but I do not.

01:49:08.807 --> 01:49:14.205
MARISHA: It's such a quiet bird. I'm used to very
loud birds.

01:49:14.205 --> 01:49:18.983
MATT: You guys gather some kindling, get back to
your three horses and your comparatively

01:49:18.983 --> 01:49:24.471
uncomfortable riding arrangement, and continue on
for another hour on the outside of the forest

01:49:24.471 --> 01:49:30.268
before the sun does eventually vanish. The graying
sky is getting darker and darker, the faint bits

01:49:30.268 --> 01:49:35.534
of orange that poke through-- it's not a beautiful
sunset, you only catch the faint hues that manage

01:49:35.534 --> 01:49:39.834
to push through the gloom, but the sky grows dark
enough to the point where you think you should set

01:49:39.834 --> 01:49:42.939
up camp. Are you setting up camp at the edge of
the forest, on the inside of the forest, on the

01:49:42.939 --> 01:49:44.498
outside of the forest, what's your preference?

01:49:44.498 --> 01:49:46.149
LIAM: Off inside, I think.

01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:47.601
ASHLY: Yeah, I think inside as well.

01:49:47.601 --> 01:49:52.230
MATT: Okay. You guys set up camp. Who's keeping
first watch?

01:49:52.230 --> 01:49:53.352
LIAM: I will.

01:49:53.352 --> 01:49:54.704
TALIESIN: I'll also do first watch.

01:49:54.704 --> 01:49:59.226
LIAM: I will begin it by putting out the silver
thread around the group.

01:49:59.226 --> 01:50:07.739
MATT: You guys want to both individually roll
perception or one aid the other? With the help action.

01:50:07.739 --> 01:50:08.728
SAM: Help action!

01:50:09.676 --> 01:50:10.494
LIAM: Individual.

01:50:10.494 --> 01:50:11.207
TALIESIN: Individual.

01:50:11.207 --> 01:50:12.121
LIAM: Because I can't decide.

01:50:12.121 --> 01:50:12.995
MATT: Go for it.

01:50:12.995 --> 01:50:15.473
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

01:50:15.473 --> 01:50:17.804
LIAM: Better than my 16.

01:50:17.804 --> 01:50:18.760
MATT: Plus?

01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:22.336
TALIESIN: Oh. Plus... three. 23.

01:50:22.336 --> 01:50:31.358
MATT: All righty. As everyone's settling in,
begins to find their initial portions of rest, you

01:50:31.358 --> 01:50:36.561
guys have your small fire there on the edge.
Molly, you glance off deeper into the forest...

01:50:36.561 --> 01:50:45.216
and your eyes, even at this distance, catch a
faint glimmer of matching flame. You see a faint

01:50:45.216 --> 01:50:50.584
bit of firelight sparkling about 200 feet deeper
into the forest.

01:50:50.584 --> 01:50:55.167
TALIESIN: There's another... there's another
campfire.

01:50:55.167 --> 01:50:58.450
LIAM: How far away?

01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:00.627
TALIESIN: 200 feet, give or take.

01:51:00.627 --> 01:51:03.049
LIAM: Uh...

01:51:03.049 --> 01:51:06.189
TALIESIN: Do you want to send a bird, maybe?

01:51:06.189 --> 01:51:13.507
LIAM: I would send one of two things. One is our
little friend here, or--

01:51:13.507 --> 01:51:14.951
TALIESIN: She's sleeping.

01:51:14.951 --> 01:51:21.937
LIAM: Or I... lose the peregrine and go back to
something else a little less noticeable.

01:51:21.937 --> 01:51:26.432
TALIESIN: I'd say go ahead. I figure if they were
meaning us any harm they wouldn't set a fire.

01:51:26.432 --> 01:51:28.531
LIAM: And it's dark out now, yeah?

01:51:28.531 --> 01:51:32.158
MATT: It is dark, yeah. It's probably pushing
10:00, 10:30.

01:51:32.158 --> 01:51:37.860
LIAM: (sighs) I would know if an owl-- Owls can
see in the dark?

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:40.255
MATT: Owls are nocturnal yes. You would know
that.

01:51:40.255 --> 01:51:50.904
LIAM: Yeah, okay. Okay. I'm going to change
Frumpkin again, out of peregrine into an owl. I

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:54.177
will mark that off on my supplies. I've got one
more after this that I can do.

01:51:54.177 --> 01:51:54.808
MATT: Okay.

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:56.341
TALIESIN: We get a long rest.

01:51:56.341 --> 01:52:00.174
LIAM: And uh-- No, I mean I need incense but
anyway--

01:52:00.174 --> 01:52:02.530
MATT: You don't have your long rests yet, so don't
mark that yet.

01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:03.139
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:52:03.139 --> 01:52:09.967
LIAM: Yeah. I send Frumpkin tree to tree in that
direction. Maybe, 20 feet and wait a moment and

01:52:09.967 --> 01:52:11.230
then another 20 feet.

01:52:11.230 --> 01:52:15.582
MATT: Okay. So as Frumpkin begins to crawl through
the forest in the direction of the fire, we're

01:52:15.582 --> 01:52:16.525
going to go ahead and take a break.

01:52:16.525 --> 01:52:18.040
SAM: Oh. Wait, no. What? Huh? Oh.

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:20.447
(laughter)

01:52:20.447 --> 01:52:21.914
MATT: Yeah. It's almost nine o'clock so we're
going to take a break.

01:52:21.914 --> 01:52:22.507
SAM: Okay.

01:52:22.507 --> 01:52:27.097
MATT: So we'll be back here in a few minutes.
Thank you for coming along with us for this bit so

01:52:27.097 --> 01:52:32.436
far. We'll be back to continue from where we left
off there. We do have our first giveaway at our

01:52:32.436 --> 01:52:33.708
first break in the new studio.

01:52:33.708 --> 01:52:35.763
(cheers)

01:52:35.763 --> 01:52:41.542
MATT: There are some changes and such so reminding
you guys that moving forward we'll be doing the

01:52:41.542 --> 01:52:45.391
Wyrmwood giveaway at the Critical Role Twitch
chat. So you need to head to

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:51.694
twitch.tv/criticalrole for the break to enter. If
you're watching on Alpha or Geek &amp;amp; Sundry just

01:52:51.694 --> 01:52:55.372
switch over and you can head on back over when
you're done. Right now, the offer, once again,

01:52:55.372 --> 01:52:59.729
only stands for people in the US and Canada
excluding Quebec because of weird giveaway rules

01:52:59.729 --> 01:53:07.298
and laws. However, tonight's prize is a Wyrmwood
cherry dice tower with this fantastic cartography

01:53:07.298 --> 01:53:14.230
burned in of maps designed by our fantastic Deven
Rue, who you may recognize, who's done the map of

01:53:14.230 --> 01:53:19.660
the Dwendalian Empire that we have here as well as
other amazing bits and also designed the compass

01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:25.282
rose on our map. She's amazing. Her work's amazing
and while this isn't available with Wyrmwood yet,

01:53:25.282 --> 01:53:29.117
keep an eye out because cool stuff like this might
be showing up more often. So this will be given

01:53:29.117 --> 01:53:34.586
away to some lucky person in the break. Need to go
into the Critical Role Twitch chat and enter only

01:53:34.586 --> 01:53:45.847
one time. Enter the key phrase "Kegstand." So
enter it once. Magnets, it's magic. So enter it

01:53:45.847 --> 01:53:48.990
once; more than once, you'll be disqualified and
we'll announce the winner here at the end of the

01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:50.476
break so we'll see you here in a few minutes.

01:53:50.476 --> 01:53:51.151
ASHLY: That's cute.

01:53:51.151 --> 01:53:52.285
SAM: Wait, which chat?

01:53:52.285 --> 01:53:53.461
MATT: Critical Role.

01:53:53.461 --> 01:53:55.713
SAM: Okay, cool. You've said that. You said that,
right?

01:53:55.713 --> 01:54:00.501
MATT: I did. Like twice. All righty. Break time
guys, let's go.

01:54:02.186 --> 01:54:08.959
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. We have our winner
of our giveaway for this fantastic Deven Rue

01:54:08.959 --> 01:54:17.312
map-etched dice tower by Wyrmwood. It is
GottaBeKD18. Congratulations, GottaBeKD18, you are

01:54:17.312 --> 01:54:20.602
the winner! Danoba will get your contact
information and we'll get this sent out to you

01:54:20.602 --> 01:54:25.385
ASAP. Well done! You've won the first giveaway in
the new studio. I am excited for you to try it

01:54:25.385 --> 01:54:34.701
out; it's quite delightful. All righty. Bringing
us back into where we left off. Frumpkin wanders

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:36.437
off through the darkened forest.

01:54:36.437 --> 01:54:39.535
SAM: (hooting)

01:54:39.535 --> 01:54:42.395
MARISHA: Oh yeah, he's an owl now. He's so cute.

01:54:42.395 --> 01:54:44.878
SAM: One, two, three.

01:54:44.878 --> 01:54:48.018
MARISHA: Mr. Owl was a dick. It was a dick move.

01:54:48.018 --> 01:54:49.318
ASHLY: Yeah, it really was.

01:54:49.318 --> 01:54:57.716
MATT: One, two, three, fuck you. As Frumpkin
begins--

01:54:57.716 --> 01:54:59.049
[owl hooting]

01:54:59.049 --> 01:55:03.839
SAM: What the fuck was that, Matt?! There was an
owl that just hooted on the soundtrack.

01:55:03.839 --> 01:55:12.889
MATT: Yeah. We're in a forest at night, guys.
Frumpkin makes his way through the dark tree

01:55:12.889 --> 01:55:18.961
bottoms, eventually coming upon-- actually, this
would be a more creepy setting for this, I think.

01:55:18.961 --> 01:55:31.934
That's better. Frumpkin slowly comes upon the
warmth of this distant fire, closer and closer

01:55:31.934 --> 01:55:39.987
until coming around the corner, seeing a small
fire heating a cauldron of some kind, some metal

01:55:39.987 --> 01:55:50.035
bowl. A bit of steam is rising off of whatever
liquid is in the interior. You see an elderly

01:55:50.035 --> 01:56:00.069
woman in darker, tattered clothing that drapes off
of the body, hunched but tall, very tall, like six

01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:09.563
and a half feet tall at a hunch. Make a perception
check for Frumpkin, please, at this distance with disadvantage.

01:56:09.568 --> 01:56:11.215
LIAM: With disadvantage?

01:56:11.215 --> 01:56:11.866
MATT: Yes.

01:56:11.866 --> 01:56:16.554
LIAM: Okay. Perception, you said? 14.

01:56:16.554 --> 01:56:30.980
MATT: The skin of this woman is a faint gray
color, almost a gray-blue tint. The hair is this

01:56:31.324 --> 01:56:37.366
matted mess of tangled white and gray that is
pulled back and tied behind the head where it

01:56:37.366 --> 01:56:46.672
cascades over the shoulders. The ears are long and
pointed, out to the sides a bit. The nose is wide

01:56:46.672 --> 01:56:54.758
and pressed up into the face. She is going back
and forth from this little hovel that's on the

01:56:54.758 --> 01:56:59.939
opposite side, that's built between two trees: a
large thick one and another that seems to have

01:56:59.939 --> 01:57:05.826
fallen and come to rest at an angle next to it. In
that small cranny between the two trees, you can

01:57:05.826 --> 01:57:15.485
see this little hut built of thatch and sticks and
rope to construct this little home. It's almost

01:57:15.485 --> 01:57:22.496
like an arch that's holding it up. Near the ground
of this cauldron, you see a child of some kind

01:57:22.496 --> 01:57:28.902
that is sitting on the ground, holding knees to
its chest. It looks to be a boy.

01:57:28.902 --> 01:57:30.227
LIAM: Knees to chest?

01:57:30.227 --> 01:57:30.885
MATT: Yes.

01:57:30.885 --> 01:57:37.408
LIAM: Okay. She is paying him no mind at the
moment?

01:57:37.408 --> 01:57:41.967
MATT: At the moment, no. It looks like she is
going to and from this little homestead and

01:57:41.967 --> 01:57:44.541
putting things into this cauldron.

01:57:44.541 --> 01:57:53.540
LIAM: I whisper in fragments what I saw through
Frumpkin's eyes the whole time, but I'm still

01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.266
looking and I can't hear anybody.

01:57:55.266 --> 01:57:57.421
MARISHA: Do you have any awake?

01:57:57.421 --> 01:57:59.556
TALIESIN: Just us.

01:57:59.556 --> 01:58:08.281
LIAM: Oh, right, I would be holding onto Molly.
This is reminding me of stories that my mother

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:17.904
told me when I was very young. Not good ones,
things to scare me into following the rules. I

01:58:17.904 --> 01:58:18.790
come out of it.

01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:22.486
TALIESIN: A child?

01:58:22.486 --> 01:58:27.060
LIAM: And a woman, or not.

01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:41.883
TALIESIN: That does have a vibration, doesn't it?
I'm not at my best right now. If they're human,

01:58:41.883 --> 01:58:46.223
even if they're friendly, I'm not the first face
you'd want to see.

01:58:46.223 --> 01:58:53.669
LIAM: Quickly. Have to think here, because
everyone else is sleeping and that didn't look

01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:57.729
good for that little boy, but then it doesn't
really help us with what we are doing, but then

01:58:57.729 --> 01:58:59.528
the child. What to do?

01:58:59.528 --> 01:59:00.912
TALIESIN: You have a friendly owl.

01:59:00.912 --> 01:59:05.052
LIAM: I go back into Frumpkin to see what's going
on.

01:59:05.052 --> 01:59:18.883
MATT: Okay. You watch now as the woman takes a
small clay cup and dips it into this cauldron and

01:59:18.883 --> 01:59:25.702
pulls out this steaming mass of liquid that she's
contained within it, turns to the child, walks

01:59:25.702 --> 01:59:33.861
over and kneels down beside. Places the long
fingers along the shoulder and hands the cup to

01:59:33.861 --> 01:59:40.341
the child. The child takes it, looking at her, and
slowly sips from it. Burns the mouth a little bit.

01:59:40.341 --> 01:59:43.093
LIAM: I swat at Molly and say: Wake the others.

01:59:43.093 --> 01:59:45.991
TALIESIN: Fine. I start quietly waking.

01:59:45.991 --> 01:59:51.001
MARISHA, SAM, and ASHLY: What? What?

01:59:51.001 --> 01:59:56.136
TALIESIN: I somehow woke everyone at the exact
same time. It's one of my many powers.

01:59:56.136 --> 01:59:58.264
SAM: We were all spooning.

01:59:58.264 --> 02:00:03.818
TALIESIN: Left hand, right hand, tail. I got it
all working at once. We've got a bit of a

02:00:03.818 --> 02:00:04.876
situation outside.

02:00:04.876 --> 02:00:05.514
SAM: Where?

02:00:05.514 --> 02:00:07.645
TALIESIN: It's going to require some delicacy.

02:00:07.645 --> 02:00:09.110
SAM: Is Caleb gone?

02:00:09.110 --> 02:00:11.357
TALIESIN: Caleb's dead. It's all over.

02:00:11.357 --> 02:00:11.961
SAM: No!

02:00:11.961 --> 02:00:13.970
MARISHA: You're looking at him.

02:00:13.970 --> 02:00:16.870
SAM: Okay. I didn't know if he was a phantom or
something.

02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:18.932
ASHLY: What's going on?

02:00:18.932 --> 02:00:20.969
TALIESIN: There's a boy, there's an old woman.

02:00:20.969 --> 02:00:26.708
LIAM: I'm not sure, but I think there is a young
child that's in danger there. We seemed to care

02:00:26.708 --> 02:00:29.735
about the bird child, maybe we care about this
one. I don't know.

02:00:29.735 --> 02:00:30.409
SAM: Of course.

02:00:30.409 --> 02:00:32.035
ASHLY: Why do we give a shit?

02:00:32.035 --> 02:00:33.849
SAM: It's a baby.

02:00:33.849 --> 02:00:35.728
ASHLY: Ah, fuck.

02:00:35.728 --> 02:00:38.853
LIAM: We got to act right now.

02:00:38.853 --> 02:00:40.749
ASHLY: What does the woman look like?

02:00:40.749 --> 02:00:46.396
MARISHA: I'm going to groggily stumble over, put
on my googles as I start stumbling towards the light.

02:00:46.926 --> 02:00:48.819
LIAM: She looked dead. She did not look natural.

02:00:48.819 --> 02:00:52.266
TALIESIN: I'm going to stay 30 feet behind and try
and stealth.

02:00:52.266 --> 02:00:53.994
MATT: Beauregard, you're leading up?

02:00:53.994 --> 02:00:58.225
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to walk and I'm like:
It's bright enough, and I got to pee anyway. I'll

02:00:58.225 --> 02:00:59.037
be right back.

02:00:59.037 --> 02:01:00.866
MATT: So not stealthing?

02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:03.725
SAM: Maybe you should not go first.

02:01:03.734 --> 02:01:05.769
MARISHA: Okay, no, I'll stealth a little bit.

02:01:05.769 --> 02:01:06.743
MATT: Roll a stealth check, Beau.

02:01:10.233 --> 02:01:13.883
MARISHA: Okay. That was almost good. 11.

02:01:13.883 --> 02:01:16.885
MATT: Who else is following Beau?

02:01:16.885 --> 02:01:21.965
SAM: I'm going to not follow, but go off to the
side and try to go around the other way.

02:01:21.965 --> 02:01:23.225
MATT: Stealth check from you.

02:01:23.225 --> 02:01:24.789
TALIESIN: We have not had a short rest yet, have
we?

02:01:24.789 --> 02:01:25.280
MATT: Nope.

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:26.137
TALIESIN: Okay, just checking.

02:01:26.137 --> 02:01:28.643
LIAM: A short rest? I thought we did, back at the
house.

02:01:28.643 --> 02:01:31.861
MATT: A short rest-- You didn't call it out.

02:01:31.861 --> 02:01:34.808
MARISHA: But he was on first watch.

02:01:34.808 --> 02:01:38.118
LIAM: I happily went, "I get to use arcane
recovery" in my head because of the conversation

02:01:38.118 --> 02:01:38.884
that was happening.

02:01:38.884 --> 02:01:42.138
MATT: I will allow a short rest before you guys
went to bed. It's fine, I'll allow it.

02:01:42.138 --> 02:01:42.732
SAM: 16.

02:01:42.732 --> 02:01:43.459
LIAM: Thank you, Matt.

02:01:43.459 --> 02:01:53.217
MATT: The two of you have branched off and are
stealthing, you think. What are you doing, Caleb?

02:01:53.217 --> 02:01:59.636
LIAM: I wanted to go with Nott, about 20 feet
behind, and cast Mage Armor as I go.

02:02:00.255 --> 02:02:01.431
MATT: Okay, and what's your stealth check?

02:02:01.431 --> 02:02:03.377
LIAM: It is a big ten.

02:02:03.377 --> 02:02:05.803
MATT: Okay. What are you doing, Keg?

02:02:05.803 --> 02:02:12.816
ASHLY: I pick up my battleaxe and there's a little
medallion hanging from the bottom of it and I look

02:02:12.816 --> 02:02:17.742
at it and I go: Goddamn it, and I try to stealth
after them. Natural 20.

02:02:17.742 --> 02:02:19.661
MATT: You have disadvantage, however, in your
armor.

02:02:19.661 --> 02:02:21.194
ASHLY: Natural 20.

02:02:21.194 --> 02:02:25.005
ALL: Whoa!

02:02:25.005 --> 02:02:26.462
TALIESIN: That die never does that for me.

02:02:26.462 --> 02:02:29.429
LIAM: You did this last time. You're not human!

02:02:29.429 --> 02:02:31.575
MATT: The anti-Wheaton has been found.

02:02:31.575 --> 02:02:34.925
LIAM: You can't come back!

02:02:34.925 --> 02:02:38.912
MATT: You can never touch Wil Wheaton, or you guys
will cancel each other out like the bad guy in

02:02:38.912 --> 02:02:48.036
Time Cop. Oh my god. Strangely, the stealthiest of
all of you is the dwarf in plate armor.

02:02:48.036 --> 02:02:55.058
MARISHA: Amazing. It's lubricated with all the
blood of her enemies.

02:02:55.058 --> 02:02:59.447
MATT: Exactly. All right, Molly, you're staying 30
feet back?

02:02:59.447 --> 02:03:07.767
TALIESIN: I'm staying 30 feet back and attempting
a stealth check. That's cocked. That's better.

02:03:07.767 --> 02:03:11.790
That's (counting) 12.

02:03:11.790 --> 02:03:20.097
MATT: You all slowly begin to approach this fire,
seeing the shapes and the figures described by

02:03:20.097 --> 02:03:28.126
Caleb previously. Beau, you step forward and your
foot catches an under root and stumble for a

02:03:28.126 --> 02:03:35.096
moment. You hear the scrambling of her arms across
the bottom of the forest floor, the moving and

02:03:35.096 --> 02:03:40.172
shifting of leaves and branches. The old woman
looks up in that direction and looks back at you,

02:03:40.172 --> 02:03:46.840
immediately making eye contact with you about 30
feet away. Her arms immediately jump up in your

02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:52.554
direction as she begins to shout, "You! You will
not take any more of us! I will sooner die!"

02:03:52.554 --> 02:04:02.286
MARISHA: I reach back out to her and I go: Yes,
right?! We are so going to die. I'm with you.

02:04:02.286 --> 02:04:04.739
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

02:04:09.099 --> 02:04:10.206
MARISHA: Saving throw?

02:04:10.206 --> 02:04:10.725
MATT: Yes.

02:04:10.725 --> 02:04:13.313
MARISHA: 15?

02:04:13.313 --> 02:04:20.418
MATT: You feel some sort of magical force suddenly
penetrate your mind, and this sparkle of colors

02:04:20.866 --> 02:04:25.175
begin to spray in front of your face that
completely distract you and obscure your vision

02:04:25.175 --> 02:04:31.496
momentarily, but you blink out of it and find the
effect drift off of your brain. The old woman goes

02:04:31.496 --> 02:04:37.304
"(panting)," and reaches down and puts herself in
front of the boy, between you and the child.

02:04:37.304 --> 02:04:48.740
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not bad. I'm not one of the bad
guys... That you were definitely talking about.

02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:53.595
That I'm aware of, right? What bad guys are you
talking about?

02:04:53.595 --> 02:04:55.070
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:04:55.070 --> 02:04:55.663
MARISHA: Okay.

02:04:57.903 --> 02:04:59.207
LIAM: Ooh, that's craziness.

02:04:59.207 --> 02:05:03.324
MARISHA: That's in the middle of nowhere. Okay,
18.

02:05:03.324 --> 02:05:11.245
MATT: Her immediate tension drops slightly. She's
still maintaining a very defensive position in

02:05:11.245 --> 02:05:17.552
front of the child. One hand is still up, but it
seems that she's pulled back a bit from the

02:05:17.552 --> 02:05:22.993
aggressive stance she was previously in. As she
lifts her face a bit, you can see a bit more of

02:05:22.993 --> 02:05:28.836
her expression in the light as the hair pulls away
as she lifts her chin. You can see that the face

02:05:28.836 --> 02:05:39.015
is humanoid, but with a wider nose. The skin is
grayish, almost a blue tint, with bits of a soft

02:05:39.015 --> 02:05:44.581
fur. It takes you a second to recognize where
you've seen these features before. This appears to

02:05:44.581 --> 02:05:48.932
be the same type of race that Pumat Sol is.

02:05:48.932 --> 02:05:49.462
MARISHA: Firbolg?

02:05:49.462 --> 02:05:50.576
MATT: It is a firbolg.

02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:52.541
MARISHA: Amazing!

02:05:52.541 --> 02:05:59.417
MATT: You can see there is a series of necklaces
that looks to be bones and rocks and stones that

02:05:59.953 --> 02:06:05.836
have been polished that dangle around her neck as
adornments and trinkets. A few bird skulls hanging

02:06:05.836 --> 02:06:12.770
on it, as well. The child, also you see, is a
young firbolg, as well. Knees tucked against his

02:06:12.770 --> 02:06:18.915
chest. You can see that the child looks scraped up
and bruised, and appears to have been injured.

02:06:18.915 --> 02:06:31.149
MARISHA: I say, Bad guys kidnapping kids, right?
That's scary stuff. Trying to protect your son?

02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:36.684
MATT: "Not my son, but we have lost a few, yes."

02:06:39.494 --> 02:06:40.375
MARISHA: Who--

02:06:40.375 --> 02:06:46.635
MATT: Looks past you, for a second, to Molly, who
is not being stealthy, either. "How many are you?"

02:06:47.220 --> 02:06:49.145
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four, five--

02:06:49.145 --> 02:06:50.413
MARISHA: Currently five--

02:06:50.413 --> 02:06:51.008
TALIESIN: Five!

02:06:51.008 --> 02:06:55.933
MARISHA: But just call us the Nein. The Mighty
Nein.

02:06:55.933 --> 02:06:57.193
MATT: "Very well."

02:06:57.193 --> 02:07:04.813
MARISHA: Here, M. Nein? (whistles)

02:07:04.813 --> 02:07:06.350
TALIESIN: I'm just walking out at this point.

02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:08.910
SAM: I'll slowly emerge from the shadows.

02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:10.257
ASHLY: I'm staying in the forest.

02:07:10.257 --> 02:07:10.926
LIAM: Same.

02:07:12.986 --> 02:07:24.792
MATT: Okay. "I apologize, I've been on edge for a
number of days. You seem to know these people or

02:07:24.792 --> 02:07:27.257
"have heard of them at least?"

02:07:27.257 --> 02:07:31.340
TALIESIN: We've lost a few recently.

02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:43.661
MATT: "I'm sorry. I am Jumnda. I'm a healer in my
aged years for the Guiatao Clan. We are small in

02:07:43.979 --> 02:07:46.167
"number and, now, yet smaller still."

02:07:46.167 --> 02:07:48.651
MARISHA: The Guitaya Clan?

02:07:48.651 --> 02:07:49.705
MATT: Guiatao.

02:07:49.705 --> 02:07:51.351
MARISHA: Guai--

02:07:51.351 --> 02:07:53.911
MATT: G-U-I-A-T-A-O.

02:07:53.911 --> 02:07:59.228
MARISHA: Guiatao Clan.

02:07:59.809 --> 02:08:09.613
MATT: "This little one is Umbo. He is awake now,
which is good fortune. I've been trying to bring

02:08:09.613 --> 02:08:12.251
"him back to health for a couple of days."

02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:19.271
MARISHA: You say he's not your son, but part of
your clan?

02:08:19.271 --> 02:08:22.676
MATT: "Yes, he is under my care now."

02:08:22.676 --> 02:08:27.241
MARISHA: Is the whole clan wiped out? Who's left?

02:08:27.241 --> 02:08:39.951
MATT: The woman, Jumnda, looks around for second
and takes a deep breath. "Three days back, the

02:08:39.951 --> 02:08:46.004
"clan was in celebration for the coming of age for
young Duma. Roasted boar was prepared, and the

02:08:46.004 --> 02:08:53.851
"twenty of us were dancing around the fire when the
murderers came. Slew Toffah and Wolya with their

02:08:53.851 --> 02:09:01.892
"arrows as they danced together. Others fought.
Fennis died protecting me, and I managed to grab

02:09:01.892 --> 02:09:10.397
"Ombo here as he had been beaten within an inch of
his life to unconsciousness. We fled. But I

02:09:10.397 --> 02:09:16.800
"watched as they grabbed others in nets, pulling
them away as they screamed and yet made no noise."

02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:27.683
You know exactly who and what she's talking about.
The methods are very familiar. "When they left, I

02:09:27.683 --> 02:09:34.565
"returned to nurse those I could back to health.
Nila, by some luck, was off when the attack

02:09:34.565 --> 02:09:39.525
"happened. She returned to find her love and child
taken.

02:09:39.525 --> 02:09:47.051
MATT: "Nila went off to find them alone. I begged
her to stay, else she join their fate, but it's

02:09:47.051 --> 02:09:55.662
"impossible to stop a mother when the child is in
danger. So I fear for her life but I understand

02:09:55.662 --> 02:10:12.055
"her drive. So here I am, here he is, and a few
survivors care to what remains of our village a

02:10:12.055 --> 02:10:22.294
"ways back that direction." She points deeper into
the forest. "So, you know my story, what's yours?"

02:10:27.019 --> 02:10:31.805
MARISHA: Other half of our party members were
taken from us in the middle of the night, just

02:10:31.805 --> 02:10:38.655
last night. Seems very similar ways, considering
neither of the rest of us heard anything.

02:10:38.655 --> 02:10:41.389
TALIESIN: Just woke up and they were gone.

02:10:41.389 --> 02:10:43.356
MATT: "They were lucky."

02:10:43.356 --> 02:10:46.261
TALIESIN: We'll see.

02:10:46.261 --> 02:10:53.622
MATT: "Had you been awake, you might have had the
urge or instinct to defend them."

02:10:54.125 --> 02:11:01.272
TALIESIN: Well, we're making our way to see if
something can be done.

02:11:01.272 --> 02:11:01.834
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:11:01.834 --> 02:11:06.243
MATT: "Well, you're as brave as Nila."

02:11:06.243 --> 02:11:12.216
MARISHA: Nila? She's the one going after them?

02:11:12.216 --> 02:11:19.471
MATT: "She was. I don't know where she is or if
she has fared well-- if they've found her. I think

02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:21.489
she overestimates her capability."

02:11:21.489 --> 02:11:24.967
MARISHA: What was her son's name?

02:11:24.967 --> 02:11:28.148
MATT: "Her son was Dua."

02:11:28.148 --> 02:11:33.790
ASHLY: Can I do an insight check just to make sure
that she's telling the truth?

02:11:33.790 --> 02:11:34.632
MATT: You may.

02:11:34.632 --> 02:11:36.878
ASHLY: 15.

02:11:36.878 --> 02:11:37.686
MATT: 15?

02:11:37.686 --> 02:11:43.643
SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Whispers?

02:11:43.643 --> 02:11:52.913
SAM: Guys, D&amp;amp;D Beyond is a wonderful platform, in
which you can organize your statistics and your

02:11:52.913 --> 02:11:59.137
equipment and they've just recently done a revamp
of their layout. Liam, how do you like it?

02:11:59.137 --> 02:12:01.642
LIAM: I like it. It feels like I am looking at the
paper.

02:12:01.642 --> 02:12:03.441
SAM: And it's customizable!

02:12:03.567 --> 02:12:06.102
LIAM: It's customizable. I haven't customized mine
yet.

02:12:06.102 --> 02:12:07.785
ASHLY: We're talking about D&amp;amp;D Beyond?

02:12:07.785 --> 02:12:08.473
LIAM: Always.

02:12:08.473 --> 02:12:09.037
SAM: Nice.

02:12:09.037 --> 02:12:10.603
LIAM: Yes, Keg, we are.

02:12:10.603 --> 02:12:12.317
ASHLY: I heard it's a wonderful service.

02:12:12.317 --> 02:12:28.338
MATT: "Well, if we indeed have an enemy in common,
you are welcome to stay with us." And she glances

02:12:28.338 --> 02:12:33.916
across you. "I can perhaps maybe tend to some of
your wounds. We have tea that's ready that may

02:12:33.916 --> 02:12:36.959
"help you in your journey ahead."

02:12:36.959 --> 02:12:39.436
TALIESIN: I genuinely don't know how to say no to
tea.

02:12:39.436 --> 02:12:46.029
MARISHA: You couldn't bring a horse back from the
dead, could you? Just didn't know how far your

02:12:46.029 --> 02:12:47.305
abilities stretch.

02:12:47.305 --> 02:12:49.981
MATT: "I'm afraid that is beyond my capability."

02:12:49.981 --> 02:12:51.915
TALIESIN: You can't heal a dead horse.

02:12:51.915 --> 02:12:54.655
MARISHA: Water Closet's gone forever--

02:12:54.655 --> 02:12:55.405
SAM: Yes.

02:12:55.405 --> 02:12:57.832
TALIESIN: Downtrodden.

02:12:57.832 --> 02:13:00.954
MARISHA: He saved our lives a lot. (laughing)
Downtrodden.

02:13:00.954 --> 02:13:03.536
SAM: Stop! (whispering) Bastard.

02:13:03.536 --> 02:13:06.957
ASHLY: Keg comes out from the forest.

02:13:06.957 --> 02:13:12.114
SAM: Ah! I forgot you were with us!

02:13:12.114 --> 02:13:17.945
ASHLY: Thanks a lot, Nott! What are we doing
here?

02:13:17.945 --> 02:13:22.700
SAM: Well these people have suffered the same fate
that our frie--

02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:24.520
ASHLY: We going to help every single person we see
along this road?

02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:31.964
SAM: We're mutually-- We're going after the same
people that have affected them.

02:13:31.964 --> 02:13:36.405
LIAM: (yelling) We were going to camp back there,
but instead we are going to camp over there!

02:13:36.405 --> 02:13:40.030
MARISHA: That's Caleb. He always stands about 20
feet back.

02:13:40.030 --> 02:13:40.921
LIAM: (yelling) At least!

02:13:40.921 --> 02:13:47.839
MATT: "Well, if there are more of you, they are
welcome as well. I do not know if I have enough

02:13:48.247 --> 02:13:50.229
"tea for everyone if there is more, but--"

02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:52.786
TALIESIN: I'm feeling all right, but--

02:13:52.786 --> 02:13:54.932
LIAM: It's just the five Neins.

02:13:54.932 --> 02:14:02.093
ASHLY: So you're just offering us a place to stay?
You don't want anything out of this?

02:14:02.093 --> 02:14:02.926
MATT: "No."

02:14:02.926 --> 02:14:05.531
ASHLY: All right.

02:14:05.531 --> 02:14:07.710
SAM: Some people are just good.

02:14:07.710 --> 02:14:11.667
TALIESIN: Some people make tea. I'm going to head
in.

02:14:11.667 --> 02:14:15.725
MARISHA: Can you do anything about this acid burn?
And I sit down next to her.

02:14:15.725 --> 02:14:21.074
MATT: "I see that you have encountered some of the
ankheg variety."

02:14:21.074 --> 02:14:24.085
MARISHA: Oh! They are called ankhegs, you guys!

02:14:24.085 --> 02:14:25.706
SAM: Related to you?

02:14:25.706 --> 02:14:33.324
ASHLY: No, Nott. Keep trying, you little
detective. You'll get it one day.

02:14:33.324 --> 02:14:43.017
SAM: The subject seems to be exhibiting signs of
distress, or at least annoyance.

02:14:43.017 --> 02:14:44.094
ASHLY: Annoyance!

02:14:44.094 --> 02:14:53.159
MATT: You gather over to their space. It's a nice,
lived-in space. You get the sense this is the home

02:14:53.159 --> 02:14:58.321
for this medicine woman, who doesn't live directly
with the rest of the village. She inspects your

02:14:58.321 --> 02:15:06.525
wounds, has some balms and natural remedies to
help prevent infection. The tea, while it is not

02:15:06.525 --> 02:15:13.820
necessarily delicious by any means-- it is very
herbal and medicinal-- it does fill you with a

02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:18.966
sense of rest and relief, and what restlessness
you may have been struggling with through a

02:15:18.966 --> 02:15:21.378
night's rest is absolved.

02:15:21.378 --> 02:15:24.625
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Chamomile.

02:15:24.625 --> 02:15:34.650
MATT: As you guys manage to say here for the
evening, you get the benefits of a long rest. You

02:15:34.650 --> 02:15:41.617
come to consciousness. Now in the morning day,
which is a little more peaceful.

02:15:41.617 --> 02:15:45.089
TALIESIN: I have cards. We could have played
cards.

02:15:45.089 --> 02:15:53.901
MATT: You awaken. Over by the fire the little boy,
Ombo, is sitting there, currently with these two

02:15:53.901 --> 02:16:02.239
small wooden pikes that are jammed into the side
and some squirrel-like critters that are hanging

02:16:02.239 --> 02:16:08.908
on them that are put towards the fire, cooking. As
you awaken, Ombo turns and smiles. Doesn't say

02:16:08.908 --> 02:16:15.221
anything, but looks over and inspects them and
then brings them back and hands them out to you.

02:16:15.221 --> 02:16:18.048
SAM: It's breakfast.

02:16:18.048 --> 02:16:19.631
TALIESIN: I will definitely take some.

02:16:19.631 --> 02:16:21.052
SAM: I'll take one. Yes, thank you.

02:16:21.052 --> 02:16:31.752
LIAM: Do you understand what I am saying? Do you
speak? Is his ward awake?

02:16:31.752 --> 02:16:37.807
MATT: You don't see her at the moment, but you do
hear a bit of rustling in the actual little hovel

02:16:37.807 --> 02:16:39.760
in the tree archway.

02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:45.794
ASHLY: Can I make a perception check around to
make sure everything is copacetic?

02:16:45.801 --> 02:16:47.088
MATT: You can.

02:16:47.088 --> 02:16:48.871
ASHLY: 16.

02:16:48.871 --> 02:16:54.292
MATT: You notice that the horses have actually
been brought closer. They've been hitched together

02:16:54.292 --> 02:17:00.691
to one of the local stumps, to the circle here. It
seems that in your rest, your very deep rest

02:17:00.691 --> 02:17:08.112
through the evening, a lot of things have been
tended to and taken care of in your presence.

02:17:08.112 --> 02:17:09.624
TALIESIN: They've got turn-down service here.

02:17:09.624 --> 02:17:17.468
MATT: As part of your long rest, and the tea which
you took in the evening, you do have advantage on

02:17:17.468 --> 02:17:21.394
perception checks for the next eight hours.

02:17:21.394 --> 02:17:28.409
LIAM: I bring Frumpkin-- without saying a word,
telepathically, I have Frumpkin come down in front

02:17:28.409 --> 02:17:36.858
of the child, and do a little owl nonsensical
shimmy dance on the ground, just for ten seconds,

02:17:36.858 --> 02:17:44.555
to catch his attention, then have Frumpkin flutter
up and land on his head and gently find purchase

02:17:44.555 --> 02:17:45.450
and sit.

02:17:45.450 --> 02:17:49.745
MATT: Okay. He freezes on the arrival.

02:17:49.745 --> 02:17:50.438
LIAM: I smile.

02:17:50.438 --> 02:18:04.418
MATT: He seems to smile again, looking up at you,
looking up at Frumpkin. Stays frozen in place. At

02:18:04.418 --> 02:18:14.285
which point, the doorway opens from the hut and
Jumna emerges with a small pouch of some kind.

02:18:14.285 --> 02:18:22.371
Steps up to the rest of you. "I see you have
awoken. I know you'll be on your way shortly, but

02:18:22.371 --> 02:18:30.802
"maybe this can help." She pulls back the top of
the leather pack and reaches in, and pulls out a

02:18:30.802 --> 02:18:37.754
cluster of moss that has been dried, and holds it
out to whoever's closest or wishes to take it.

02:18:37.754 --> 02:18:38.966
LIAM: Mollymauk will take that.

02:18:38.966 --> 02:18:39.686
TALIESIN: Always.

02:18:39.686 --> 02:18:41.523
SAM: What does it do?

02:18:41.523 --> 02:18:52.092
MATT: "Should you find yourself in a wounded
state, this should help you with some rapid

02:18:52.092 --> 02:19:01.509
"recovery of the wounds." It acts as a greater
healing potion, but it takes a minute to

02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:04.184
administer, so it's a non-combat scenario.

02:19:04.184 --> 02:19:05.752
SAM: Do you smoke it?

02:19:05.752 --> 02:19:14.619
MATT: "No, it is crumbled and then ingested. You
can also put some in the actual wounds, if you

02:19:14.619 --> 02:19:17.304
"like, but it is meant for ingestion."

02:19:17.304 --> 02:19:20.177
SAM: See? People are just nice sometimes.

02:19:20.177 --> 02:19:22.021
ASHLY: Never in my experience.

02:19:22.021 --> 02:19:24.835
LIAM: Only sometimes.

02:19:24.835 --> 02:19:30.754
TALIESIN: Do you know which way this friend of
yours was heading to find them? It was north on

02:19:30.754 --> 02:19:32.019
the path, I suppose.

02:19:32.019 --> 02:19:36.286
MATT: "Just north is what I know. North,
northeast?"

02:19:36.286 --> 02:19:38.339
TALIESIN: We'll see what we can do.

02:19:38.339 --> 02:19:47.984
MATT: "If you find her and whatever state you find
her... if it's not a good state, will you promise

02:19:47.984 --> 02:19:52.098
"me to at least bring her back so we can give her a
proper burial?"

02:19:52.098 --> 02:19:54.864
ASHLY: This ain't part of my deal.

02:19:54.864 --> 02:19:57.616
TALIESIN: If it's possible we'll see what we can
do.

02:19:57.616 --> 02:19:58.491
MATT: "That's all I can ask."

02:19:58.491 --> 02:20:00.010
TALIESIN: All things being equal.

02:20:00.010 --> 02:20:06.818
MATT: "Anyway. I thank you. Ombo thanks you.
And--"

02:20:06.818 --> 02:20:14.152
TALIESIN: I look at the kid. Is he freaked out by
the way I look? Is he--?

02:20:14.152 --> 02:20:15.437
MATT: No, not at all.

02:20:15.437 --> 02:20:17.569
TALIESIN: I'm going to go down and try something.

02:20:17.569 --> 02:20:21.895
MATT: He does have a giant owl on his shoulder and
is currently preoccupied with the owl.

02:20:21.895 --> 02:20:29.183
TALIESIN: I'm going to try this. I haven't tried
this yet. I'm going to hold up the moon card, and

02:20:29.183 --> 02:20:36.276
I'm going to try and do a sleight of hand trick
and flip it to one of my little moon trinkets,

02:20:36.276 --> 02:20:37.149
moon baubles.

02:20:37.149 --> 02:20:39.105
MATT: Ooh. Make a sleight of hand check.

02:20:39.105 --> 02:20:44.492
TALIESIN: It would be the most hilarious natural
one-- eight.

02:20:44.492 --> 02:20:50.776
MATT: Eight? Okay. It happens but--

02:20:50.776 --> 02:20:52.364
TALIESIN: It's not beautiful yet--

02:20:52.364 --> 02:20:56.446
MATT: The trick is very visible, what you did, the
kid still seems amused.

02:20:56.446 --> 02:20:58.504
TALIESIN: I give him the bauble.

02:20:58.504 --> 02:21:05.535
MATT: Smiles. Frumpkin ruffles his feathers, looks
a bit spooked.

02:21:06.090 --> 02:21:09.527
TALIESIN: I give him a little scratch. The
horses?

02:21:09.527 --> 02:21:13.347
SAM: Yes, we should keep going to find their
friends.

02:21:13.347 --> 02:21:15.845
LIAM: Thank you both.

02:21:15.845 --> 02:21:22.519
MATT: "Thank you for hopefully doing some good in
a very dark world."

02:21:22.519 --> 02:21:26.199
LIAM: Well. Dark business at hand.

02:21:26.199 --> 02:21:31.206
SAM: Do you know someone named Pumat Sol?

02:21:31.206 --> 02:21:38.639
MATT: "Uh... that does not ring a bell?"

02:21:38.639 --> 02:21:47.716
SAM: How about one of his friends Pumat Sol or
Pumat Sol or Pumat Sol?

02:21:47.716 --> 02:21:51.359
MATT: "I apologize, I do not."

02:21:51.359 --> 02:21:53.521
SAM: I just thought maybe they knew each other.

02:21:53.521 --> 02:21:54.773
LIAM: They all know each other.

02:21:54.773 --> 02:21:56.933
SAM: I don't know how many of these there are!

02:21:56.933 --> 02:21:58.467
SAM: Me? I'm--

02:21:58.467 --> 02:22:01.110
LIAM: Do you know a goblin named Furgle Burgle?

02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:06.015
SAM: No! I don't know every goblin! There's lots
of goblins! I never-- All right, all right, point

02:22:06.015 --> 02:22:07.089
taken, point taken.

02:22:07.089 --> 02:22:10.753
(laughter)

02:22:10.753 --> 02:22:21.381
MATT: As you guys gather your things, get the
horses ready, Ombo approaches and gives a little

02:22:21.381 --> 02:22:27.150
wave. You watch as Jumma approaches from behind
and rests her hand on his shoulder. Looks up to

02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:29.479
you and says, "Please, be safe."

02:22:29.479 --> 02:22:38.861
MARISHA: We'll try. Thank you. Man, normally Fjord
is here to do this part.

02:22:38.861 --> 02:22:40.083
SAM: No, that was really good!

02:22:40.083 --> 02:22:41.371
TALIESIN: You did very well.

02:22:41.371 --> 02:22:43.645
LIAM: That is the best you ever did.

02:22:43.645 --> 02:22:51.515
MARISHA: Thank you. that does feel good. I did
something today.

02:22:51.515 --> 02:22:54.503
TALIESIN: You were nearly charming.

02:22:54.503 --> 02:22:56.876
MATT: Charming adjacent?

02:22:56.876 --> 02:23:00.383
MARISHA: All right. We leave.

02:23:00.383 --> 02:23:06.912
LIAM: As we leave, Frumpkin's head does that crazy
owl thing that goes 180 and flips around and just

02:23:06.912 --> 02:23:07.951
looks as--

02:23:07.951 --> 02:23:16.615
MATT: As you vanish into the treeline, Ombo the
child seems transfixed by the owl's behavior

02:23:16.615 --> 02:23:22.798
before disappearing behind the trees, and you guys
find your way back to the open fields of the

02:23:22.798 --> 02:23:28.886
northern Marrow Valley. So. Now back on horseback,
what pace are you traveling at? Are you still

02:23:28.886 --> 02:23:30.368
going at a fast pace?

02:23:30.368 --> 02:23:32.356
LIAM: We are well-rested.

02:23:32.356 --> 02:23:38.386
MARISHA: We've already lost two of our horses, why
not lose a few more?

02:23:38.386 --> 02:23:40.695
TALIESIN: We're the Three Amigos is really--

02:23:40.695 --> 02:23:49.847
LIAM: Now all of us know-- ooh I went Vax. All of
us know, what you already knew, which is-- yes,

02:23:50.193 --> 02:23:56.761
still hurts-- that these people are terrible. And
deserve no mercy.

02:23:56.761 --> 02:24:03.721
SAM: Not the firbolgs we just met, right? You were
talking about the people who kidnapped our friends.

02:24:03.721 --> 02:24:04.805
LIAM: What do you think?

02:24:04.805 --> 02:24:08.244
SAM: I think-- we're still talking about the
people who kidnapped our friends.

02:24:08.244 --> 02:24:13.703
TALIESIN: Everybody's doing so much better
suddenly. It's as if the vacuum means other people

02:24:13.703 --> 02:24:16.683
have to start pulling some slack. It's nice.

02:24:16.683 --> 02:24:18.118
MARISHA: What?

02:24:18.118 --> 02:24:25.226
TALIESIN: Well suddenly you're being kind of
charismatic. Nott's making moralistic judgments

02:24:25.226 --> 02:24:29.508
that are in the direction of reasonable.

02:24:29.508 --> 02:24:30.863
SAM: Sure, sure.

02:24:30.863 --> 02:24:35.428
ASHLY: I will say that I don't want to get hung up
trying to help those people while we're in Shady Run.

02:24:35.773 --> 02:24:40.565
LIAM: Oh, you know. If we can. We're not
altruistic by nature, either.

02:24:40.565 --> 02:24:42.421
ASHLY: All right.

02:24:42.421 --> 02:24:48.872
MARISHA: You know, if we stumble upon one of them
maybe be like, "Hey. Met your grandma."

02:24:48.872 --> 02:24:52.164
TALIESIN: Some days it's not hard to do a good
turn.

02:24:52.164 --> 02:24:58.058
LIAM: But let's be clear, we're going to eliminate
the problem.

02:24:58.058 --> 02:24:58.942
TALIESIN: Cheers.

02:24:58.942 --> 02:25:03.815
LIAM: Save our friends. And if we can do something
extra, we do something extra. When we can.

02:25:03.815 --> 02:25:06.776
SAM: And maybe even complete our mission.

02:25:06.776 --> 02:25:10.155
TALIESIN: I'd forgotten about that.

02:25:10.155 --> 02:25:16.526
MARISHA: I know that's a big deal, that whole
mission completing thing.

02:25:16.526 --> 02:25:18.364
TALIESIN: Been a little distracted.

02:25:18.364 --> 02:25:19.253
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:25:19.253 --> 02:25:21.412
LIAM: All right, let's run these bastards down,
ja?

02:25:21.412 --> 02:25:23.974
MATT: All right. Are you going at a normal pace,
or a fast pace?

02:25:23.974 --> 02:25:25.161
MARISHA: Fast pace.

02:25:25.161 --> 02:25:34.697
SAM: At a fast pace Matthew-- I'm on horseback
with Caleb right? Could I be on the back, maybe

02:25:34.697 --> 02:25:38.700
just flipping through Jester's sketchbook?

02:25:39.292 --> 02:25:40.131
MATT: Sure.

02:25:40.131 --> 02:25:43.129
SAM: Okay, I'm going to look through the whole
thing.

02:25:43.129 --> 02:25:53.528
MATT: All right. It is absurd. There are sketches
across the spectrum of silly-faced interpretations

02:25:53.528 --> 02:26:00.665
and caricatures of the people you've met, of each
of you. There are little notes to The Traveler

02:26:00.665 --> 02:26:11.131
throughout. You see people that you've liked in
the past looking beautiful, with tiny bodies, you

02:26:11.131 --> 02:26:17.430
see people who you've hated in the past getting
stepped on by a poop monster. It's childish in all

02:26:17.430 --> 02:26:20.459
the delightful ways that you'd expect from
Jester's capability.

02:26:20.459 --> 02:26:26.010
SAM: Is it all drawings? Are there any notes, or
letters, or clues to her past?

02:26:26.010 --> 02:26:40.105
MATT: There are notes. (pause) I will say, Laura
is not here to specify necessarily, that there are

02:26:40.105 --> 02:26:45.235
passages in Common to The Traveler. What languages
do you know?

02:26:45.235 --> 02:26:47.849
SAM: Common, Goblin, Halfling.

02:26:47.849 --> 02:26:52.595
MATT: And there are a number of passages in a
language you don't understand. Meatier passages.

02:26:52.973 --> 02:26:54.009
Longer ones.

02:26:54.009 --> 02:26:59.310
TALIESIN: If only there were a tiefling here, who
possibly spoke and read the same language.

02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:01.610
LIAM: Or a wizard who can read anything.

02:27:01.610 --> 02:27:05.555
LIAM and TALIESIN: Keep it to yourself.

02:27:05.555 --> 02:27:10.582
SAM: Keep it to myself. [yelling] Keep steering
Caleb, I'm looking at nudie pictures!

02:27:10.582 --> 02:27:20.052
MATT: So you carry on at a pretty good pace, and
you're traveling rather swiftly. Though traveling

02:27:20.379 --> 02:27:28.443
at this speed, it's harder to perceive things at a
distance. Thankfully, this renewed vigor from the

02:27:28.443 --> 02:27:33.873
tea that you had for the evening may help you in
that endeavor as well. So, who is keeping watch on

02:27:33.873 --> 02:27:35.112
the roads ahead of you?

02:27:35.112 --> 02:27:35.725
LIAM: I am.

02:27:35.725 --> 02:27:40.652
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a perception
check with advantage, and minus five to whatever you--

02:27:41.444 --> 02:27:43.473
LIAM: So advantage minus five on both?

02:27:43.473 --> 02:27:44.307
MATT: Correct.

02:27:44.307 --> 02:27:54.085
LIAM: Okay that's not good; that's a one. Okay,
that means I got a seven.

02:27:54.085 --> 02:27:55.050
MATT: Okay then.

02:27:55.050 --> 02:27:55.906
MARISHA: Seven?

02:27:55.906 --> 02:28:03.361
LIAM: At advantage minus five on both the rolls I
rolled a nine, and a one. So hey.

02:28:03.361 --> 02:28:09.469
MATT: For the next eight hours or so, you guys
continue on the trek on the outskirts of the

02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:17.608
Crispvale Thicket. Eventually coming to meet up
with the Glory Run Road that heads northward to

02:28:17.608 --> 02:28:22.448
the direction of Nogvurot. You can see there's a
road sign that specifically points up to Nogvurot,

02:28:22.448 --> 02:28:31.924
southward to the crossroads. Following the map and
the path you've charted out, in your experience as

02:28:31.924 --> 02:28:37.184
well, you travel for quite a ways along Glory Run
and then just head straight north towards the

02:28:37.184 --> 02:28:43.109
Quannah Breach, so you'll be going off into just
grassland and scrubland at a certain point.

02:28:43.109 --> 02:28:44.238
TALIESIN: Off-roading.

02:28:44.238 --> 02:28:53.900
MATT: Essentially. About then eight hours hit, you
have another hour or so before the sun begins to

02:28:53.900 --> 02:29:02.968
go down. You can continue to push for another hour
if you'd like to, and all take constitution saving

02:29:02.968 --> 02:29:04.258
throws, it's up to you.

02:29:04.258 --> 02:29:06.339
LIAM: If we do the one more hour it's constitution
checks?

02:29:06.339 --> 02:29:08.427
MATT: You can do the one more hour, or you can
stop and set an early camp and get another

02:29:08.427 --> 02:29:13.317
evening's rest. But, you do not spot anything along
the way. It's a beautiful open field.

02:29:13.317 --> 02:29:16.469
LIAM: I'm sharp. I should always do this.

02:29:16.469 --> 02:29:20.866
SAM: Are we getting close to where you think their
headquarters are?

02:29:20.866 --> 02:29:23.919
ASHLY: How far do we have to Shadycreek?

02:29:23.919 --> 02:29:27.688
MATT: You probably have maybe two days' more travel
before you get there.

02:29:27.688 --> 02:29:33.689
ASHLY: I'm down to push the other hour, but my
constitution is (clicks tongue).

02:29:33.689 --> 02:29:35.760
MARISHA: I'm down as well, but--

02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:36.587
TALIESIN: Let's do it.

02:29:36.587 --> 02:29:37.174
LIAM: Same.

02:29:37.174 --> 02:29:43.445
MARISHA: And in that hour we can look for a place
to rest? It's like pushing for the next rest stop.

02:29:43.786 --> 02:29:45.172
LIAM: Yes, one more. We push it one more hour.

02:29:45.172 --> 02:29:50.363
TALIESIN: Do we want to go at a steady pace for
this last hour, or do we want to push for a fast pace?

02:29:50.504 --> 02:29:52.977
LIAM: Fast equals a constitution check, right?

02:29:52.977 --> 02:29:57.093
MATT: No, you travel for another hour of
additional movement, which will get you probably

02:29:57.093 --> 02:30:01.145
another six miles ahead, then we'll see if you get
a point of exhaustion.

02:30:01.145 --> 02:30:02.131
SAM: Let's do it.

02:30:02.131 --> 02:30:06.803
MATT: You push for the ninth hour. I need you all
to make constitution saving throws, please.

02:30:06.803 --> 02:30:10.504
MARISHA: Can we look for a good camping spot?

02:30:10.504 --> 02:30:11.702
ASHLY: Natural 20.

02:30:11.702 --> 02:30:13.807
MARISHA: Oh shit!

02:30:13.807 --> 02:30:18.567
LIAM: Natural 20? I don't want to hear it!

02:30:18.567 --> 02:30:20.453
TALIESIN: Natural 19. 21.

02:30:20.453 --> 02:30:22.064
SAM: 13 total.

02:30:22.064 --> 02:30:23.307
MARISHA: 18.

02:30:23.307 --> 02:30:24.243
LIAM: Eight.

02:30:24.243 --> 02:30:27.175
ASHLY: Oh no!

02:30:27.175 --> 02:30:30.177
MATT: Caleb, you take a point of exhaustion. The
rest of you do not.

02:30:30.177 --> 02:30:33.229
LIAM: Sweet, this is my first. What happens to me?
Do I die on the spot?

02:30:33.229 --> 02:30:34.819
MARISHA: Disadvantage on your checks.

02:30:34.819 --> 02:30:36.250
MATT: On ability checks, that's all.

02:30:36.250 --> 02:30:37.437
TALIESIN: And you're hangry.

02:30:37.437 --> 02:30:41.447
LIAM: That's my secret, Taliesin. I'm always
hangry.

02:30:41.447 --> 02:30:47.875
MATT: As the sky grows dark, the still gray clouds
that have taken the sky overhead, the temperature

02:30:47.875 --> 02:30:51.812
is dropping significantly. It looks like it's
going to be a particularly cold night. Do you wish

02:30:51.812 --> 02:30:52.983
to continue pushing on?

02:30:52.983 --> 02:30:57.163
MARISHA: Along the way, do we see anything that
looks like a good alcove or somewhere that would

02:30:57.163 --> 02:30:57.783
be nice?

02:30:57.783 --> 02:30:58.660
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:30:58.660 --> 02:31:01.449
MARISHA: Which we have advantage on, right?

02:31:01.449 --> 02:31:04.465
LIAM: Eight hours, and you said the eight hours
was--?

02:31:04.465 --> 02:31:07.777
MATT: You've push now past hour nine, so you
cannot have advantage.

02:31:08.270 --> 02:31:16.445
MARISHA: A six and-- oh, no advantage? I'll take
that six with my add perception of three, so nine.

02:31:16.445 --> 02:31:16.889
MATT: Nine.

02:31:16.889 --> 02:31:18.357
MARISHA: Nein.

02:31:18.357 --> 02:31:24.986
MATT: Best you can find looking around, there are
a few small boulders or pieces of natural rock

02:31:24.986 --> 02:31:29.613
formations that have pushed up out of the local
hills, as you are moving through this more hilly

02:31:29.613 --> 02:31:34.433
area of the northern valley, but there's no
alcoves or caves that you're catching a vision of

02:31:34.433 --> 02:31:37.970
that would give you safe and out of the public
eye.

02:31:37.970 --> 02:31:42.004
TALIESIN: Does it look like if we push a little
bit further, there's any change in terrain?

02:31:42.004 --> 02:31:43.342
MATT: There's only one way to find out.

02:31:43.342 --> 02:31:44.967
TALIESIN: Even in far distance?

02:31:44.967 --> 02:31:46.626
MATT: You can travel for another hour.

02:31:46.626 --> 02:31:48.931
LIAM: Yeah, there's a way to do that.

02:31:48.931 --> 02:31:50.628
TALIESIN: Want to do one more hour and call it?

02:31:50.628 --> 02:31:51.908
ASHLY: Or Owl Boy.

02:31:51.908 --> 02:31:55.238
MARISHA: He's hangry.

02:31:55.238 --> 02:31:58.496
LIAM: We could push it, too. I'm good.

02:31:58.496 --> 02:32:00.891
TALIESIN: Let's send the owl.

02:32:00.891 --> 02:32:03.478
LIAM: Okay. Five minute little fly-ahead?

02:32:03.478 --> 02:32:07.328
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

02:32:07.328 --> 02:32:14.205
LIAM: I hold on to my horse and stop hearing
everybody. Disadvantage?

02:32:14.205 --> 02:32:17.196
MATT: It's the owl, technically, not him.

02:32:17.776 --> 02:32:22.311
LIAM: It's terrible. It's perception, was that
what I was doing? Five.

02:32:22.311 --> 02:32:30.294
MATT: At this distance, it looks like it's
straight, moving, rolling hills and bursts of stone.

02:32:30.294 --> 02:32:33.228
LIAM: It's getting dark out here, and I'm tired.

02:32:33.228 --> 02:32:35.587
TALIESIN: If we can find a stone for cover,
maybe.

02:32:35.587 --> 02:32:37.482
ASHLY: I'll take watch.

02:32:37.482 --> 02:32:40.044
TALIESIN: We'll set up a proper camp.

02:32:40.044 --> 02:32:42.955
SAM: I'll take watch with Keg.

02:32:42.955 --> 02:32:43.625
ASHLY: Great.

02:32:43.625 --> 02:32:47.995
LIAM: Before I go to sleep, I do the silver
thread.

02:32:47.995 --> 02:32:56.725
MATT: First watch is you two. Do you wish to
combine your perception checks for this watch, or

02:32:56.725 --> 02:32:57.757
take them individually?

02:32:57.757 --> 02:32:59.902
ASHLY: No.

02:32:59.902 --> 02:33:00.716
MATT: Roll individually.

02:33:00.716 --> 02:33:01.953
SAM: 13.

02:33:01.953 --> 02:33:03.074
ASHLY: Ten.

02:33:03.074 --> 02:33:10.826
MATT: First watch manages to go by. You both keep
a very sharp eye out in the distance. Nothing

02:33:10.826 --> 02:33:16.074
seems to catch your attention, though the night is
getting quite cold. Towards the end of your watch,

02:33:16.074 --> 02:33:22.422
snowfall begins to slowly descend upon the
northern valley.

02:33:22.422 --> 02:33:28.573
SAM: Chilly. Sure glad I have all this booze to
drink to keep me warm. Wouldn't you like some?

02:33:28.573 --> 02:33:32.794
ASHLY: I have 200 pounds of pure muscle. I never
get cold.

02:33:32.794 --> 02:33:38.390
SAM: Well, it tastes good, though. So there's
that, too.

02:33:38.390 --> 02:33:40.331
ASHLY: Why you trying to cozy up to me?

02:33:40.331 --> 02:33:44.649
SAM: I'm not trying to cozy up to you! I think we
got off on the wrong small feet.

02:33:44.649 --> 02:33:48.900
ASHLY: You mean when you bared your teeth at me
four times?

02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:52.687
SAM: I have to bare my teeth at everyone! Look at
these things, they're huge!

02:33:52.687 --> 02:33:54.849
ASHLY: You have no choice?

02:33:54.849 --> 02:34:00.652
SAM: No, I have very thin lips, very long teeth,
some would call them fangs. It's not my fault.

02:34:00.652 --> 02:34:04.474
When I smile, it looks like I'm trying to bite
your throat off.

02:34:04.474 --> 02:34:05.269
ASHLY: Show me?

02:34:05.269 --> 02:34:06.435
SAM: (snarls)

02:34:06.435 --> 02:34:07.113
ASHLY: Ooh.

02:34:07.113 --> 02:34:13.796
SAM: And I like tongue. I was eating some tongue
when you saw me.

02:34:13.796 --> 02:34:15.447
ASHLY: Oh, I forgot about that. I thought you were
coming on to me.

02:34:15.447 --> 02:34:17.888
SAM: No! Oh god, no.

02:34:17.888 --> 02:34:21.192
ASHLY: Well, you don't have to be that
disgusted.

02:34:21.192 --> 02:34:25.055
SAM: You're a handsome woman, but-- you're a
woman, right?

02:34:25.055 --> 02:34:25.807
ASHLY: Yes.

02:34:25.807 --> 02:34:27.203
SAM: Okay, good. Just making sure.

02:34:27.203 --> 02:34:30.297
ASHLY: Just because I have a five o'clock shadow,
doesn't mean I'm not a woman.

02:34:30.297 --> 02:34:32.080
SAM: I don't know! I don't want to presume
anything.

02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:33.715
ASHLY: All right, I'll have some booze.

02:34:33.715 --> 02:34:37.752
SAM: All right, here you go. You know, it never
runs out.

02:34:37.752 --> 02:34:39.871
ASHLY: It doesn't?

02:34:39.871 --> 02:34:40.469
SAM: No.

02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:41.818
ASHLY: Huh.

02:34:41.818 --> 02:34:49.447
SAM: Special trick. So, uh, who got took? Who are
you missing?

02:34:49.447 --> 02:34:51.779
ASHLY: Oh, that's where this conversation stops,
friend.

02:34:51.779 --> 02:34:56.378
SAM: No! What? I thought we were getting to know
each other.

02:34:56.378 --> 02:35:00.362
ASHLY: That's a big gun to pull out right after
you gave me a little bit of libation.

02:35:00.362 --> 02:35:01.715
SAM: All right, did you go to school?

02:35:01.715 --> 02:35:07.045
ASHLY: Fucking guess, detective. Do you think I
went to school?

02:35:07.045 --> 02:35:08.444
SAM: Hmm, I would say no.

02:35:08.444 --> 02:35:10.082
ASHLY: Yeah. Accurate.

02:35:10.082 --> 02:35:14.560
SAM: Did you have a happy home life growing up?

02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:24.711
ASHLY: I grew up in Shadycreek Run. Everyone's
favorite pastime there is stabbing people. No. I

02:35:24.711 --> 02:35:27.722
didn't have a nice... growing up.

02:35:27.722 --> 02:35:35.156
SAM: Hmm. I'm trying to think of a topic that's
less charged. Do you have a favorite sports team

02:35:35.156 --> 02:35:35.820
you like?

02:35:35.820 --> 02:35:39.412
(laughter)

02:35:39.412 --> 02:35:41.875
ASHLY: We could talk about Iron Chef.

02:35:41.875 --> 02:35:48.184
SAM: Iron Chef? I love Iron Chef. Never mind.

02:35:48.184 --> 02:35:49.501
ASHLY: Sorry.

02:35:49.501 --> 02:35:51.445
SAM: I just thought, well--

02:35:51.445 --> 02:35:54.804
ASHLY: Yeah, I know. You're trying to be nice.

02:35:54.804 --> 02:35:59.882
SAM: No, I just thought if we knew more about your
situation, it would maybe lead to clues that would

02:35:59.882 --> 02:36:05.572
help us track down, or know the weaknesses of
these Shepherds who stole or killed your friends.

02:36:05.572 --> 02:36:10.223
If we knew the circumstances around their untimely
demise.

02:36:10.223 --> 02:36:13.721
ASHLY: I know the Shepherds well.

02:36:13.721 --> 02:36:16.335
SAM: Were you one of them?

02:36:16.335 --> 02:36:20.601
ASHLY: No. I wasn't. I just know them well.

02:36:20.601 --> 02:36:29.807
SAM: Did you go to high school-- no, you didn't go
to school-- Hmm, everyone else is snoring.

02:36:29.807 --> 02:36:39.918
ASHLY: They're well known. Everyone there knows
them. There's no way to not know them.

02:36:39.918 --> 02:36:41.459
SAM: All right.

02:36:41.459 --> 02:36:47.494
ASHLY: So you're not trying to chat me up so much
as you're trying to siphon information.

02:36:47.494 --> 02:36:54.390
SAM: I'm doing what any good detective does, which
is just lay the groundwork for the case--

02:36:54.390 --> 02:36:57.481
ASHLY: Under who?! Who considers you the greatest
detective?

02:36:57.481 --> 02:37:07.468
SAM: Jester. Jester's one of the folks that got
stolen. Together we were a dynamic duo of mystery

02:37:07.468 --> 02:37:14.450
solving. We could solve any mystery. Find any
criminal mastermind, no matter how nefarious. We

02:37:14.450 --> 02:37:21.505
had all the tools, all the insights, all the
instincts! It was amazing. We were a well oiled

02:37:21.505 --> 02:37:27.187
machine and then... she was taken. And now it's
just me.

02:37:27.187 --> 02:37:33.167
ASHLY: I'm guessing she had most of the brains of
this duo.

02:37:33.167 --> 02:37:34.097
SAM: I resent that.

02:37:34.097 --> 02:37:40.422
ASHLY: I'm sorry. I'm sorry your friend got taken.
I'm going to try to help get her back.

02:37:40.422 --> 02:37:47.401
SAM: All right. Well, I'll try to help you get
revenge on your vague past.

02:37:47.401 --> 02:37:53.910
(laughter)

02:37:53.910 --> 02:37:57.074
ASHLY: You don't have to say it like that, I'm
just not much of a sharer!

02:37:57.074 --> 02:38:01.945
SAM: Sure, sure. How about you tell me one fact
about you and I'll tell you one about me?

02:38:01.945 --> 02:38:10.709
SAM: Something you haven't told anyone. It'll be
like a game! And we'll each take a shot.

02:38:10.709 --> 02:38:12.648
ASHLY: Shot first.

02:38:12.648 --> 02:38:17.172
SAM: Here you go. (pouring noise)

02:38:17.172 --> 02:38:28.812
ASHLY: Uh... My friend was a slave. Was enslaved
by them... By the Shepherds. So?

02:38:28.812 --> 02:38:30.803
SAM: I'm a pretty good dancer!

02:38:30.803 --> 02:38:35.231
ASHLY: I thought we were doing like some deep dive
shit!

02:38:35.231 --> 02:38:36.610
SAM: I didn't know!

02:38:36.610 --> 02:38:40.152
ASHLY: You were asking me some deep dive
questions! You're going to fucking give me the

02:38:40.152 --> 02:38:40.989
dancer shit?

02:38:40.989 --> 02:38:44.773
SAM: I didn't know! I thought we were going to
start small and then build!

02:38:44.773 --> 02:38:49.002
ASHLY: No, because you set the precedent of asking
a serious question and then you gave me the shot--

02:38:49.338 --> 02:38:50.563
SAM: You gave me the heaviest shit first though!

02:38:50.563 --> 02:38:51.984
ASHLY: That's what you wanted, I thought!

02:38:51.984 --> 02:38:52.799
SAM: Of course!

02:38:52.799 --> 02:38:56.030
TALIESIN: (yelling) We're trying to sleep for
gods' sakes!

02:38:56.030 --> 02:38:57.746
LIAM: (hoot owl call)

02:39:02.476 --> 02:39:04.934
SAM: Well, this has been fun.

02:39:04.934 --> 02:39:09.066
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm up too. Molly, you want to take
next watch?

02:39:09.066 --> 02:39:10.189
TALIESIN: Let's take the next one.

02:39:10.189 --> 02:39:10.686
MARISHA: All right.

02:39:10.686 --> 02:39:11.696
ASHLY: Yeah, I'm going to fucking bed.

02:39:11.696 --> 02:39:18.306
MATT: All right. So, Molly and Beau taking the
second watch, would you mind deciding who's making

02:39:18.306 --> 02:39:19.983
perception checks, please?

02:39:19.983 --> 02:39:21.161
Taliesin: Want to both go for it?

02:39:21.161 --> 02:39:21.828
Marisha: Yeah.

02:39:21.828 --> 02:39:23.956
MATT: All right, both roll.

02:39:23.956 --> 02:39:27.904
MARISHA: 13.

02:39:27.904 --> 02:39:28.574
TALIESIN: Nine.

02:39:28.574 --> 02:39:33.922
MATT: Okay. As you guys go to bed, the both of you
keep an eye out for the rest of the evening. For

02:39:33.922 --> 02:39:38.920
the rest of your watch, at least; and seemingly
uneventful.

02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:39.926
TALIESIN: Want to gamble?

02:39:39.926 --> 02:39:43.657
MARISHA: I'm not much of a gambler, you're
thinking of Jester.

02:39:43.657 --> 02:39:44.775
TALIESIN: No, I'm not.

02:39:44.775 --> 02:39:45.617
MARISHA: What?

02:39:45.617 --> 02:39:47.470
TALIESIN: This is a game we used to play.

02:39:47.470 --> 02:39:48.112
MARISHA: What?

02:39:48.112 --> 02:39:55.719
TALIESIN: Take my cards, set the deck down. Put a
question on the deck, whoever draws the highest

02:39:55.719 --> 02:39:57.190
card has to answer it.

02:39:57.190 --> 02:40:01.782
MARISHA: Wait are these like playing cards or
tarot cards?

02:40:01.782 --> 02:40:03.236
TALIESIN: Tarot cards but they have numbers.

02:40:03.236 --> 02:40:04.820
MARISHA: You know I fucking hate those things.

02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:05.503
TALIESIN: I know.

02:40:05.503 --> 02:40:08.448
MARISHA: I don't want anything to do with them.

02:40:08.448 --> 02:40:13.587
TALIESIN: I'll throw one out there for you. What's
the best lie you've ever told?

02:40:13.587 --> 02:40:18.426
MARISHA: The best lie I've ever told?

02:40:18.426 --> 02:40:21.490
TALIESIN: I'll give you mine if you give me yours.
Whoever gets the highest has to tell.

02:40:21.490 --> 02:40:24.254
MARISHA: Hmm...

02:40:24.254 --> 02:40:26.328
TALIESIN: Or whoever gets the lowest has to tell.

02:40:26.328 --> 02:40:29.458
MARISHA: All right, deal.

02:40:29.458 --> 02:40:33.143
TALIESIN: Let's roll d20's, see whose number is
lower.

02:40:33.143 --> 02:40:34.270
MATT: Yeah.

02:40:34.270 --> 02:40:36.294
MARISHA: Let me flip to my backstory.

02:40:36.294 --> 02:40:40.479
(laughing)

02:40:40.479 --> 02:40:41.350
MARISHA: Just in case here.

02:40:41.350 --> 02:40:46.522
TALIESIN: You can be a little vague with it. You
don't have to be... I rolled very high.

02:40:46.522 --> 02:40:51.392
MARISHA: Natural twenty.

02:40:51.392 --> 02:40:54.285
TALIESIN: Seventeen, shit.

02:40:54.285 --> 02:40:56.846
ALL: Ooh.

02:40:56.846 --> 02:40:57.743
LIAM: You played yourself.

02:40:57.743 --> 02:40:58.675
TALIESIN: I did.

02:40:58.675 --> 02:41:01.966
MARISHA: This one has a pretty big number on it.

02:41:01.966 --> 02:41:13.701
TALIESIN: Shite. Best lie I've ever told... I
pretended to be royalty for three weeks. For a scam.

02:41:14.249 --> 02:41:18.123
MARISHA: That's fascinating, what kind of scam?

02:41:18.123 --> 02:41:25.697
TALIESIN: I was-- Just a little while after I had
gotten my consciousness sort of sorted out, and we

02:41:25.697 --> 02:41:36.459
got into a town and figured out that we could
actually get some nice digs and they were seeing

02:41:36.459 --> 02:41:45.309
if I could maybe bullshit my way through it, and
it was kind of my test. So I pretended to be a

02:41:45.309 --> 02:41:48.467
reincarnated royalty from across the sea.

02:41:48.467 --> 02:41:49.454
MARISHA: Wow.

02:41:49.454 --> 02:41:52.799
TALIESIN: Yeah. (laughing)

02:41:52.799 --> 02:41:53.725
MARISHA: That's pretty fascinating.

02:41:53.725 --> 02:41:54.591
TALIESIN: That was a lot of fun.

02:41:54.591 --> 02:42:02.451
MARISHA: Do you not like knowing your past, that
way you can have multiple backstories? Be multiple

02:42:02.451 --> 02:42:03.445
people at once?

02:42:03.445 --> 02:42:14.067
TALIESIN: I like knowing that because it's not
there that it doesn't matter? And it helps knowing

02:42:14.067 --> 02:42:19.331
I don't think it matters for anybody. I don't care
where anybody's from, it's nice. I certainly don't

02:42:19.331 --> 02:42:22.241
care where I'm from.

02:42:22.241 --> 02:42:26.002
MARISHA: I'll tell you one of my best lies, the
one I was most proud of.

02:42:26.002 --> 02:42:27.748
TALIESIN: I pour-- I pass the drink.

02:42:27.748 --> 02:42:29.745
MARISHA: Just because it was a pretty good one.

02:42:29.745 --> 02:42:30.996
TALIESIN: That's usually how this rolls.

02:42:30.996 --> 02:42:39.288
MARISHA: Yeah. There was a politician in the town
where I grew up that I didn't like very much.

02:42:39.288 --> 02:42:39.940
TALIESIN: Politician?

02:42:39.940 --> 02:42:46.400
MARISHA: Didn't like his wife, either. Wanted to
find some dirt on them. Pretended to be a house

02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:51.718
hand for them, a little handyman. Found some dirt,
found out they were cheating on each other and

02:42:51.718 --> 02:42:57.340
destroyed their relationships and their lives.
Maybe I shouldn't be proud of that actually.

02:42:57.340 --> 02:43:01.618
TALIESIN: No, no I'm very impressed, actually,
that's-- you are a good friend to have and a

02:43:01.618 --> 02:43:03.423
terrible enemy to make.

02:43:03.423 --> 02:43:06.655
MARISHA: Yeah... anyway.

02:43:06.655 --> 02:43:08.609
TALIESIN: To not quite being the worst people.
Cheers.

02:43:08.609 --> 02:43:09.104
MARISHA: Cheers.

02:43:09.104 --> 02:43:09.630
TALIESIN: Night.

02:43:09.630 --> 02:43:14.066
MARISHA: Just maybe don't have a job that relies
on relationships, either.

02:43:14.066 --> 02:43:14.981
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

02:43:14.981 --> 02:43:16.169
MARISHA: Public opinion--

02:43:16.169 --> 02:43:17.390
TALIESIN: They really had it coming.

02:43:17.390 --> 02:43:17.969
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:43:17.969 --> 02:43:25.723
MATT: The rest of your watch goes uneventful,
leaving to Caleb the final watch.

02:43:25.723 --> 02:43:26.990
LIAM: I'll take this myself.

02:43:26.990 --> 02:43:32.686
MATT: All right. Make a perception check. Actually
you and Frumpkin can both make separate ones, I'll

02:43:32.686 --> 02:43:33.685
let you do that.

02:43:33.685 --> 02:43:45.948
LIAM: Good. Frumpkin got-- I'm going to use my cat
stats, because I don't have owl stats handy.

02:43:45.948 --> 02:43:47.308
MATT: I can pull those up pretty quick.

02:43:47.308 --> 02:43:48.646
LIAM: Oh okay, good.

02:43:48.646 --> 02:43:55.076
SAM AND TALIESIN: Cat stats. (musical riff) Cat
stats!

02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:01.197
MATT: All right, so that would be a plus one.

02:44:01.197 --> 02:44:02.175
LIAM: Eleven.

02:44:02.175 --> 02:44:07.402
MATT: That rely on hearing or sight, so you have
advantage on it though, because the owl does have

02:44:07.402 --> 02:44:09.192
keen hearing and sight.

02:44:09.192 --> 02:44:09.912
LIAM: Thirteen.

02:44:09.912 --> 02:44:17.060
MATT: Thirteen, okay. Looks like this watch is
uneventful as well. You guys had a clean night.

02:44:17.468 --> 02:44:24.429
LIAM: Okay, so, sitting in the silence, are any of
these people awake, that I can tell?

02:44:24.429 --> 02:44:26.596
MATT: They all seem pretty asleep.

02:44:26.596 --> 02:44:35.926
LIAM: Look at the lot of you. Look at these
people.

02:44:35.926 --> 02:44:51.085
I should go right now. I don't know you at
all. Look at this one. He's like a walking

02:44:51.085 --> 02:45:00.763
rainbow, what is this? Why are you with him? It
makes no sense. He's a circus performer, he's not

02:45:00.763 --> 02:45:09.599
going to help you. This one you told everything
to, to try to get into a library. You learned

02:45:09.599 --> 02:45:18.632
nothing. On your gamble, you failed. You're
stupid. Smart as you are, you're stupid with this.

02:45:18.632 --> 02:45:38.473
She could cave in everything. This three that have
been stolen: yeah, they're nice. Two of them.

02:45:38.473 --> 02:45:52.049
One's weird. One of them tried to kill you. The
other one, she's adorable, but-- Stupid. This one

02:45:52.049 --> 02:46:06.323
here. What do you expect to do with her? How is
she going to help you do what you want to do? She

02:46:06.323 --> 02:46:07.209
can watch your back--

02:46:07.209 --> 02:46:08.200
MATT: (hooting)

02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:18.147
LIAM: I know. Don't worry, you're fine. She's as
much a liability as anything else. You know you're

02:46:18.147 --> 02:46:31.670
fucking mad when you're gesticulating this much.
You should just go. You have told too much. I am

02:46:31.670 --> 02:46:52.047
going to go. It's time to go. He sits there for a
solid five minutes. Then two hours. Wait for

02:46:52.047 --> 02:46:54.094
everyone to wake up.

02:46:54.094 --> 02:46:57.619
MATT: Your watch comes to a close just as the
morning light begins to crest into the sky.

02:46:57.682 --> 02:47:02.190
There's a mild break in the clouds on the eastern
horizon over the Ashkeeper and the Dunrock

02:47:02.190 --> 02:47:11.973
Mountains. You're still getting a mostly cloudy
sky, but there are occasional bits of morning

02:47:11.973 --> 02:47:20.451
light, faint light blues and yellows, and soft
white. The snowfall that has come throughout the

02:47:20.451 --> 02:47:27.345
evening and packed up the very chilly cold night
is beginning to faintly thaw, but it is still a

02:47:27.345 --> 02:47:33.141
very cold morning. As you all begin to come to
consciousness and gather your things, the clouds

02:47:33.141 --> 02:47:42.630
close once more, and you look off towards the
northeast side of the valley and you can see

02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:51.245
another darkened cloud coming with more snow and a
less forgiving turn of weather. Although it's a

02:47:51.245 --> 02:48:00.605
ways off, you can see it this far away. You pick
up your things, horses at the ready. Do you

02:48:00.605 --> 02:48:02.918
continue your journey? Anything you want to do
before you head off?

02:48:02.918 --> 02:48:05.544
MARISHA: I do my morning push-up and pull-up
routine.

02:48:05.544 --> 02:48:06.831
TALIESIN: Squats.

02:48:06.831 --> 02:48:09.329
MARISHA: And then I'm ready to go.

02:48:09.329 --> 02:48:13.865
MATT: Okay. You have to set two horses side by
side and use your staff there to give you pull

02:48:13.865 --> 02:48:16.200
ups. There's not any trees here, but you manage to
pull it together.

02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:18.332
MARISHA: Dope as fuck, yes I do.

02:48:18.332 --> 02:48:19.832
LIAM: She can do it on the road.

02:48:19.832 --> 02:48:23.949
MARISHA: Holy shit you guys I just figured out how
we can save 30 minutes.

02:48:23.949 --> 02:48:29.218
MATT: On the road while you're-- You're just Chuck
Norris-ing it between the two horses. (galloping noises)

02:48:29.218 --> 02:48:31.968
ASHLY: It goes without saying that Keg is
aroused.

02:48:31.968 --> 02:48:36.707
LIAM: You should do that Arnold monologue from
that documentary, (Schwarzenegger voice) "You know

02:48:36.707 --> 02:48:41.492
"when I am with my-- I am coming. And then when I'm
working out I am coming always."

02:48:41.492 --> 02:48:43.354
MARISHA: (Schwarzenegger voice) I feel like I'm
always coming.

02:48:43.354 --> 02:48:45.422
MATT: (Schwarzenegger voice) Always pulling up.
Always.

02:48:45.422 --> 02:48:48.107
TALIESIN: That's a deep callback, wow.

02:48:48.179 --> 02:48:54.603
MATT: Pushing on at what pace? I imagine
continuing at your hurried pace?

02:48:54.603 --> 02:48:55.969
TALIESIN: Ja.

02:48:55.969 --> 02:49:00.639
MATT: Pushing on for the remainder of this day,
who is keeping watch?

02:49:00.639 --> 02:49:02.405
TALIESIN: I'll take a round.

02:49:02.405 --> 02:49:03.513
MARISHA: All right.

02:49:03.513 --> 02:49:05.492
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception for me,
please.

02:49:05.492 --> 02:49:06.763
TALIESIN: Minus five?

02:49:06.763 --> 02:49:09.252
MATT: Yes, minus five because you're traveling at
fast pace.

02:49:09.252 --> 02:49:15.360
TALIESIN: Natural 20. 23, minus five is--

02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:23.632
MATT: Still an 18. That's good. About three or so
hours into your journey, Molly, you look up ahead

02:49:23.632 --> 02:49:32.975
and you can see a cluster of horses and a couple
of carts heading your direction, heading

02:49:32.975 --> 02:49:33.994
southward.

02:49:33.994 --> 02:49:39.272
You're not quite there yet, but you're
getting close to where the direction you should

02:49:39.272 --> 02:49:47.241
continue on breaks off of Glory Run, but you're
still on the road. You do see a small caravan

02:49:47.241 --> 02:49:49.310
making their way southward in your direction.

02:49:49.310 --> 02:49:53.595
TALIESIN: Once they get a little closer, let's
slow down and walk to the side of the road and

02:49:53.595 --> 02:49:55.146
take a look at this.

02:49:55.146 --> 02:49:57.754
MATT: Okay. You guys move off to the side.

02:49:57.754 --> 02:50:04.737
ASHLY: Can I tell from looking at the cart if
there's anything off about it?

02:50:04.737 --> 02:50:06.805
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:50:06.805 --> 02:50:09.293
SAM: It's got five wheels.

02:50:09.293 --> 02:50:10.363
ASHLY: 17.

02:50:10.363 --> 02:50:15.820
MATT: Glancing off, as you approach, you begin to
make out details. You do not recognize this

02:50:15.820 --> 02:50:23.493
troupe, and the cart seems like there are tarps
and cloths laid over large bundles. They are

02:50:23.493 --> 02:50:30.086
obscured from view specifically so the contents
cannot be seen, which is not what you're looking for.

02:50:30.086 --> 02:50:31.417
ASHLY: Okay.

02:50:31.417 --> 02:50:38.262
MATT: They don't want anyone to see what's under
the tarp, which is not the usual operation that

02:50:38.262 --> 02:50:46.983
you've seen. The folks that travel southward,
they're dressed like normal traveling merchants:

02:50:46.983 --> 02:50:53.656
not of a wealthy regard, but those who probably
bring common supplies, things from the northern

02:50:53.656 --> 02:50:57.900
side, bringing them southward. It looks like they
have supplied up for a trade run and they're

02:50:57.900 --> 02:51:02.948
heading southward. As they ride past you guys to
the right side, they give a nod.

02:51:02.948 --> 02:51:05.675
SAM: Caleb, should I go check them out?

02:51:05.675 --> 02:51:07.668
MATT: The next rider gives a nod.

02:51:07.668 --> 02:51:09.567
ASHLY: They're not who we're looking for.

02:51:09.567 --> 02:51:11.134
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:51:11.134 --> 02:51:12.530
ASHLY: You can if you want to.

02:51:12.530 --> 02:51:13.797
SAM: Are they suspicious?

02:51:13.797 --> 02:51:15.998
ASHLY: Not from what I can see.

02:51:15.998 --> 02:51:18.619
TALIESIN: What kind of traders do they look like?
What are they trading in?

02:51:18.619 --> 02:51:23.675
MATT: With the perception roll you made, it's hard
to see because they've covered it specifically.

02:51:23.675 --> 02:51:31.086
You can see underneath edges and pieces that are
pushing out, and the shape in places. It looks

02:51:31.086 --> 02:51:39.840
like they're bringing farming supplies. It looks
like they're bringing possibly grains and foods.

02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:47.011
It looks like things that would be easy pickings.
They're not the kind of people that can defend it, so

02:51:47.067 --> 02:51:50.098
it's maintain mystery and keep pushing.

02:51:50.098 --> 02:51:54.047
SAM: All right. We can go.

02:51:54.047 --> 02:52:02.614
MATT: Okay. You continue on. On this next leg of
your journey, we're riding on your perception roll

02:52:02.614 --> 02:52:10.808
off the road, your natural 20. I'll let that stand
for a bit. The pace that you've been keeping on

02:52:10.808 --> 02:52:21.343
this without being kept by your cart has gained
you quite a bit of ground and about another two

02:52:21.423 --> 02:52:27.798
hours or so into this afternoon, your eyes catch
another cluster of carts facing the same direction

02:52:27.798 --> 02:52:29.115
you are.

02:52:29.115 --> 02:52:30.917
ASHLY: Can I make a perception check on this one?

02:52:30.917 --> 02:52:32.412
MATT: You may.

02:52:32.412 --> 02:52:33.707
ASHLY: 15.

02:52:33.707 --> 02:52:40.887
MATT: It takes you a moment of getting close and
you're about, I'd say, a quarter mile back from

02:52:40.887 --> 02:52:55.015
this troupe. You can see the familiar two larger
carts, one smaller. It stinks of familiarity to you.

02:52:55.015 --> 02:52:57.148
ASHLY: This might be them.

02:52:57.148 --> 02:52:58.508
MARISHA and SAM: What?

02:52:58.508 --> 02:53:00.002
MARISHA: Did we catch up to them?

02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:01.561
ASHLY: We may have.

02:53:01.561 --> 02:53:05.940
SAM: Caleb, look at this picture of you in
Jester's book. It's really funny.

02:53:05.940 --> 02:53:07.257
ASHLY: It's not the time, Nott!

02:53:07.257 --> 02:53:08.645
SAM: Oh, no?

02:53:08.645 --> 02:53:11.435
MARISHA: We shouldn't clue them off that we're
here.

02:53:11.435 --> 02:53:12.905
TALIESIN: No, let's slow our pace.

02:53:12.905 --> 02:53:18.023
MARISHA: Okay. Maybe a couple of us could flank
around? What's the terrain?

02:53:18.023 --> 02:53:19.958
SAM: They're moving, right?

02:53:19.958 --> 02:53:21.361
MATT: They're moving, yeah.

02:53:21.361 --> 02:53:35.525
ASHLY: Can your owl see if there's a big human
man, fighter-looking guy?

02:53:35.525 --> 02:53:38.386
LIAM: Bigger than average-sized man, you mean?

02:53:38.386 --> 02:53:46.106
ASHLY: Yeah. He's pretty surly, intimidating
looking. He might have a half-elf with him.

02:53:46.106 --> 02:53:48.481
LIAM: Well, we're about to get into it, yeah?

02:53:48.481 --> 02:53:53.146
TALIESIN: I think we should wait until they start
to set up camp. They've got to stop at some point.

02:53:53.146 --> 02:53:54.749
SAM: We don't even know who they are yet, though.

02:53:54.749 --> 02:53:55.907
MARISHA: What time is it?

02:53:55.907 --> 02:54:01.420
MATT: It's mid-afternoon at this time. You've been
traveling since shortly after daybreak, so it's three

02:54:01.420 --> 02:54:06.166
o'clock in the afternoon. You have another hour or
so before you hit your eight hour mark and your

02:54:06.166 --> 02:54:07.858
horses start tiring and you start tiring.

02:54:07.858 --> 02:54:09.412
MARISHA: We're nowhere near Shadycreek?

02:54:09.412 --> 02:54:15.133
MATT: You're a couple days' travel or so from it
at this pace.

02:54:15.133 --> 02:54:17.020
TALIESIN: They're going to have to camp.

02:54:17.020 --> 02:54:23.898
LIAM: I'll tell you what I do is, I dab my thumb
into my belt for a bit of sweet oil and I rub it

02:54:23.898 --> 02:54:33.560
on my bottom lip and mutter an arcane word or two
and say: I suggest you tell us any details you've

02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:41.768
been holding back about these people so that we
are fully prepared. That is a Suggestion spell.

02:54:41.768 --> 02:54:51.253
MATT: Yes, it is. I'm going to have to ask you,
Keg, to make a wisdom saving throw, please.

02:54:51.253 --> 02:54:54.730
ASHLY: Nine.

02:54:54.730 --> 02:54:56.278
LIAM: No.

02:54:56.278 --> 02:55:03.764
MATT: That is not a success. You feel, strangely,
though it is out of character for your intent,

02:55:03.764 --> 02:55:09.558
magically compelled to offer up a fair amount of
information that would seem useful in the coming

02:55:09.558 --> 02:55:12.767
scenario about these individuals.

02:55:12.767 --> 02:55:17.068
SAM: We love our guests. We love them.

02:55:17.068 --> 02:55:33.597
ASHLY: There should be five of them. The leader's
name's Lorenzo. He's a human. This is weird. Ruzza

02:55:33.597 --> 02:55:48.506
the half-elf sorcerer. Protto, shitty little
halfling rogue. Dwelma is a half-orc druid woman.

02:55:48.506 --> 02:55:53.306
How much more do I have to tell?

02:55:53.306 --> 02:55:56.700
MATT: As much as would seem useful for this.

02:55:56.700 --> 02:56:00.299
LIAM: It was details that would help us in the
situation.

02:56:00.299 --> 02:56:02.188
ASHLY: I have to say everything?

02:56:02.188 --> 02:56:08.970
LIAM: You're compelled to say anything that's
useful in what we're about to do with these

02:56:08.970 --> 02:56:10.140
people.

02:56:10.140 --> 02:56:13.495
MATT: Yes. Interpret that as you feel necessary.

02:56:13.495 --> 02:56:16.268
LIAM: Any other details that you've been holding
back that would help us in this situation.

02:56:16.268 --> 02:56:18.077
MARISHA: Lorenzo is a fighter type?

02:56:18.077 --> 02:56:19.389
ASHLY: Yes.

02:56:19.389 --> 02:56:28.960
MATT: You do know that he walks with this
nasty-looking glaive. It's a polearm with a large

02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:36.744
hooked blade at the end of it that he uses as both
a symbol of station and a very dangerous weapon,

02:56:36.744 --> 02:56:40.360
if need be. Gives him reach, gives him range.

02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:52.196
ASHLY: I tell you about that, and Juam. She's a
human barbarian. She's not as bad as the rest of

02:56:52.196 --> 02:56:56.793
them. That's all I know.

02:56:56.793 --> 02:56:58.660
LIAM: No magic?

02:56:58.660 --> 02:57:01.054
ASHLY: There's a sorcerer.

02:57:01.054 --> 02:57:02.495
TALIESIN: And a druid.

02:57:02.495 --> 02:57:05.530
MATT: You're pretty sure there's a sorcerer,
you're pretty sure there's a druid. You don't know

02:57:05.530 --> 02:57:10.430
a lot about magic stuff, but you know one of them
seems to be more nature-based and the other seems

02:57:10.430 --> 02:57:16.702
to throw spells, but is cock-sure and
charismatic.

02:57:16.702 --> 02:57:19.670
TALIESIN: Do you know anything about the cages
they keep their prisoners in? Are they magically

02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:21.769
enchanted or are they just cages?

02:57:21.769 --> 02:57:29.848
ASHLY: They'll look like normal trade from the
outside. They'll look like they'll be shuttling

02:57:29.848 --> 02:57:38.144
around food, innocuous items, but there's a
magical obfuscation over them.

02:57:38.144 --> 02:57:42.330
LIAM: The ones with the arcane ability look like?

02:57:42.330 --> 02:57:49.906
ASHLY: The half-elf and the half-orc are the ones
that are magical.

02:57:49.906 --> 02:57:53.178
LIAM: What color is the half-elf's hair?

02:57:53.178 --> 02:57:55.931
ASHLY: I don't remember.

02:57:55.931 --> 02:58:02.360
MATT: The half-elf is a very short, pointed pixie
cut that is ashy blonde.

02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:07.298
MARISHA: What was the name of the rogue again?

02:58:07.298 --> 02:58:09.767
ASHLY: The rogue is Protto.

02:58:09.767 --> 02:58:11.038
MARISHA: Protto.

02:58:11.038 --> 02:58:19.944
ASHLY: And I lied, Nott. I used to work with
them.

02:58:19.944 --> 02:58:24.749
LIAM: That is a pretty big matzo ball.

02:58:24.749 --> 02:58:28.251
ASHLY: Yeah. I'm not proud.

02:58:28.251 --> 02:58:32.705
TALIESIN: I sort of figured. I figured everyone
else figured at this point, really?

02:58:32.705 --> 02:58:41.332
SAM: I definitely deduced that from our
conversation. It's not surprising to me in the least.

02:58:41.332 --> 02:58:44.892
LIAM: I take people at their word.

02:58:44.892 --> 02:58:50.646
TALIESIN: I do, too. But, you know, people say
things.

02:58:50.646 --> 02:58:56.237
SAM: I lied too. I'm an average dancer.

02:58:56.237 --> 02:59:04.132
(laughter)

02:59:04.132 --> 02:59:07.069
ASHLY: So we're even Steven.

02:59:07.069 --> 02:59:11.303
TALIESIN: How bad are the terms that you're on
with these people?

02:59:11.303 --> 02:59:13.165
ASHLY: Pretty bad!

02:59:13.165 --> 02:59:16.444
SAM: Want some more booze?

02:59:16.444 --> 02:59:21.562
ASHLY: Yeah. Shot, shot, shot. Yeah, not great.

02:59:21.562 --> 02:59:27.167
MATT: The spell comes to a close now because you
have fulfilled the suggestion.

02:59:27.167 --> 02:59:29.338
ASHLY: Ah, you guys are assholes.

02:59:29.338 --> 02:59:31.134
SAM: We told you that.

02:59:31.134 --> 02:59:32.332
TALIESIN: That's fair.

02:59:32.332 --> 02:59:34.250
SAM: We said that multiple times.

02:59:34.250 --> 02:59:35.658
ASHLY: Can we see if it's them?

02:59:35.658 --> 02:59:38.450
SAM: Yeah, how? Can you go owl it out?

02:59:38.450 --> 02:59:40.314
LIAM: Yeah, lay low.

02:59:40.314 --> 02:59:43.168
TALIESIN: We're starting to get a plan.

02:59:43.168 --> 02:59:50.833
LIAM: I plant my hand on Nott's head and go into
Frumpkin's eyesight and send him up there.

02:59:50.833 --> 03:00:01.534
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin takes off and begins to coast
at a fair enough distance to keep an eye down. Make a

03:00:01.534 --> 03:00:03.998
perception check for Frumpkin with advantage.

03:00:03.998 --> 03:00:05.556
LIAM: Advantage, you say?

03:00:05.556 --> 03:00:08.134
MATT: Yeah, he's an owl still. Owl has keen sight
and hearing.

03:00:08.134 --> 03:00:11.532
LIAM: Yeah! Owl rolls, yeah! 20.

03:00:11.532 --> 03:00:18.750
MATT: Frumpkin, getting a nice view from this
distance, makes out that there are three carts.

03:00:18.750 --> 03:00:26.659
There is a figure at each cart. The two larger
ones have two horses at each front, the third one

03:00:26.659 --> 03:00:32.632
has one horse. There is a rider on each of the
horses, or at least there is a rider on the

03:00:32.632 --> 03:00:35.840
smaller horse and there are two that are sitting
at the front of the carts that are currently

03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:42.289
holding onto the reins of the other two. You do
see, sitting next to the individual at the reins

03:00:42.289 --> 03:00:49.333
at the front, a very thick, muscular man, bald
with tattoos across the back of his head--

03:00:49.333 --> 03:00:50.904
MARISHA: This is our fucking guy!

03:00:50.904 --> 03:01:01.156
MATT: With the glaive resting at the side, staring
ahead. Everyone else seems to have hoods up and

03:01:01.156 --> 03:01:05.326
are trying to keep their image obfuscated.

03:01:05.326 --> 03:01:07.209
LIAM: All but Lorenzo?

03:01:07.209 --> 03:01:10.591
MATT: Lorenzo, he has a cloak on and stuff, but
right now he has the hood back. You really don't

03:01:10.591 --> 03:01:17.625
see anybody catching their attention. He seems to
be enjoying the air across his hairless head.

03:01:17.625 --> 03:01:22.860
LIAM: It's good. It's true, shaved head. The wind,
it's good.

03:01:22.860 --> 03:01:29.693
MATT: You see seven figures.

03:01:29.693 --> 03:01:33.924
MARISHA: Wait, in the cages?

03:01:33.924 --> 03:01:36.055
TALIESIN: There's no cages, they're magically--

03:01:36.055 --> 03:01:37.780
ASHLY: I assume you communicated all of this to
us?

03:01:37.780 --> 03:01:40.943
SAM: Yeah, he usually narrates as he sees.

03:01:40.943 --> 03:01:42.525
ASHLY: Okay.

03:01:42.525 --> 03:01:44.213
TALIESIN: With his very dulcet tones.

03:01:44.213 --> 03:01:45.742
LIAM: Sure, this time he does.

03:01:45.742 --> 03:01:46.765
SAM: Sometimes you do.

03:01:46.765 --> 03:01:48.481
LIAM: Sometimes I do, lately.

03:01:48.481 --> 03:01:50.854
ASHLY: We can't attack them like this.

03:01:50.854 --> 03:01:53.645
SAM: Why not? There's five of us and--

03:01:53.645 --> 03:01:55.037
ASHLY: There's seven of them!

03:01:55.037 --> 03:01:57.104
SAM: We have an owl.

03:01:57.104 --> 03:02:04.149
TALIESIN: I have a plan. It's a bit of a crazy
plan. They're carrying the means of their own

03:02:04.149 --> 03:02:09.826
undoing. If we can free whoever is in those cages,
we get a lot of allies.

03:02:09.826 --> 03:02:11.666
ASHLY: We don't know if it's your friends.

03:02:11.666 --> 03:02:15.805
TALIESIN: Anybody in there I'm sure is going to
have feelings towards these people.

03:02:15.805 --> 03:02:18.679
ASHLY: Look.

03:02:18.679 --> 03:02:20.113
MARISHA: So we wait until they camp?

03:02:20.113 --> 03:02:23.332
TALIESIN: I like waiting until they camp and
coming in at night.

03:02:23.332 --> 03:02:25.162
MARISHA: What were you going to say, Keg?

03:02:25.162 --> 03:02:37.279
ASHLY: When they take people, they break them. So
if you're counting on whoever's in those cages to

03:02:37.279 --> 03:02:42.934
help, they're not going to be able to. It's going
to be five versus seven, even if we attack at night.

03:02:42.934 --> 03:02:47.311
MARISHA: Like mentally break them?

03:02:47.311 --> 03:02:48.880
ASHLY: Both.

03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:50.555
MARISHA: Fuck.

03:02:50.555 --> 03:02:55.862
MATT: As far as you know, most of that process
happens once they take them back because usually

03:02:55.862 --> 03:03:05.373
it's a grab and run type scenario. But they do
usually have them manacled, hogtied manacle style

03:03:05.373 --> 03:03:06.771
and gagged.

03:03:06.771 --> 03:03:09.655
TALIESIN: If we can just get into that cage and
untie them without them noticing.

03:03:09.655 --> 03:03:11.624
SAM: At night, maybe after they've camped.

03:03:11.624 --> 03:03:16.149
LIAM: This is our best chance because we don't
want them to get to their destination because then

03:03:16.149 --> 03:03:18.223
they are surrounded by many friends.

03:03:18.223 --> 03:03:19.953
SAM: Or a fortress or something.

03:03:19.953 --> 03:03:21.436
LIAM: Yeah. Now is the time.

03:03:21.436 --> 03:03:27.638
SAM: Should we just continue to follow them for
now or attack right now in the broad daylight?

03:03:27.638 --> 03:03:32.180
ASHLY: How far are they from Shadycreek? You said
two days?

03:03:32.180 --> 03:03:33.262
MATT: About two days, yeah.

03:03:33.262 --> 03:03:34.361
ASHLY: Okay.

03:03:34.361 --> 03:03:37.098
MATT: Two days at your pace, probably three days
at theirs.

03:03:37.098 --> 03:03:38.143
ASHLY: Okay.

03:03:38.143 --> 03:03:41.934
TALIESIN: Wait until the sun sets right before
they go to sleep.

03:03:41.934 --> 03:03:50.187
SAM: Oh! We know where they're going. We know
where they are. Why don't we ride ahead of them--

03:03:50.187 --> 03:03:51.528
MARISHA: And set up an ambush?

03:03:51.528 --> 03:03:52.455
SAM: Yes!

03:03:52.455 --> 03:03:53.965
MARISHA: That's a damn good idea.

03:03:53.965 --> 03:03:55.324
ASHLY: I like that.

03:03:55.324 --> 03:03:58.022
TALIESIN: I could be into that.

03:03:58.022 --> 03:04:02.616
LIAM: That is wicked.

03:04:02.616 --> 03:04:08.843
MARISHA: I wonder if we could do a little bit of
both. Free the people in the cage and then ambush

03:04:08.843 --> 03:04:10.542
later? Nah, that seems distracting.

03:04:10.542 --> 03:04:14.730
TALIESIN: Ambush. Free people. All one big thing.
I'm sure they're not used to being attacked by

03:04:14.730 --> 03:04:16.317
people who actually know what they have.

03:04:16.317 --> 03:04:20.332
ASHLY: You actually had a good idea for once.

03:04:20.332 --> 03:04:24.302
SAM: Thank you. I'd better get drunk, then.

03:04:24.302 --> 03:04:30.681
TALIESIN: Let's full-speed blow past them, just
nod and keep moving.

03:04:30.681 --> 03:04:33.270
SAM: On the same road? We're not even going to go
around?

03:04:33.357 --> 03:04:38.808
LIAM: No, wait until they sleep. We're going to
follow at a distance and then when they bed down

03:04:38.808 --> 03:04:42.339
for the night, we leave and then skirt around.

03:04:42.339 --> 03:04:44.138
TALIESIN: All right.

03:04:44.138 --> 03:04:45.352
LIAM: I like this.

03:04:45.352 --> 03:04:46.514
TALIESIN: This is a good plan

03:04:46.514 --> 03:04:48.931
LIAM: Well done Nott, well done.

03:04:48.931 --> 03:04:50.025
MATT: All right.

03:04:50.025 --> 03:04:52.443
(laughter)

03:04:52.443 --> 03:04:56.890
MATT: So keeping your distance behind them, pulling
your pace back to just the normal, even slow pace,

03:04:56.890 --> 03:05:00.051
it's up to you. Probably normal to keep in pace
with them.

03:05:00.051 --> 03:05:01.442
MARISHA: At a medium pace.

03:05:01.442 --> 03:05:03.436
MATT: It was going to happen eventually.

03:05:03.542 --> 03:05:05.441
SAM: You're gross, Marisha.

03:05:05.441 --> 03:05:10.454
MARISHA: I'm the worst.

03:05:10.454 --> 03:05:17.906
MATT: About a few more hours, sundown hits, we'll
say for the purposes of the narrative here. They

03:05:17.906 --> 03:05:22.310
pull off to the side of the road and begin to set
up camp. Keeping an eye on this in the distance,

03:05:22.310 --> 03:05:30.798
you watch them. Keeping far enough away, making
sure you're not in eyeshot of them, as part of

03:05:30.798 --> 03:05:38.648
that, I will say two of you helm a stealth check to
see whether or not they see you on the road behind them.

03:05:38.648 --> 03:05:40.365
TALIESIN: Yeah, it'll be the two of you.

03:05:40.365 --> 03:05:41.454
MARISHA: Helming a stealth check?

03:05:41.454 --> 03:05:43.886
SAM: Why don't you look at that dodec?

03:05:43.886 --> 03:05:47.387
MARISHA: Well, I already have it, I just haven't
used it yet.

03:05:47.387 --> 03:05:49.192
MATT: Well, it lasts for a day.

03:05:49.192 --> 03:05:53.550
MARISHA: Do I still have it? I don't have it. Oh,
but I can look at it again!

03:05:53.550 --> 03:05:57.829
LIAM: Of course you can. This is why I say you
shouldn't just hand it over. Just save it for the

03:05:57.829 --> 03:05:59.235
moment.

03:05:59.235 --> 03:06:05.909
MARISHA: I thought I might have needed it on the
thing, but I rolled a natural 20 on my sack check.

03:06:05.909 --> 03:06:12.908
MATT: All right, you take your fragment of
possibility. So... go ahead and roll.

03:06:12.908 --> 03:06:17.205
MARISHA: Do I have to call that I'm going to use
advantage on it before or I can roll and then choose?

03:06:17.205 --> 03:06:20.408
MATT: It's afterward. You can roll it and then
choose to. It's like a luck point.

03:06:20.408 --> 03:06:25.424
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Yeah, it's 20 total.

03:06:25.424 --> 03:06:27.064
SAM: Wow, mine's 19.

03:06:27.064 --> 03:06:28.448
MATT: All right.

03:06:28.448 --> 03:06:31.167
MARISHA: (whispers) Should I do it again?

03:06:31.167 --> 03:06:40.908
MATT: You guys stay back and watch as they pull
off and make camp. With that, as the cover of

03:06:40.908 --> 03:06:46.440
ever-encroaching night becomes your ally, you
begin to arc around on the opposite end of the

03:06:46.440 --> 03:06:54.135
road going behind one of the larger hill grades,
which manages to hide your horses as you speed up

03:06:54.135 --> 03:07:01.653
and take off ahead. To do this, it's going to cost
you an hour of pushing past, so everyone make your

03:07:01.653 --> 03:07:04.089
constitution saving throws please.

03:07:04.089 --> 03:07:06.864
SAM: 12?

03:07:06.864 --> 03:07:08.642
ASHLY: 15?

03:07:08.642 --> 03:07:09.784
MATT: Okay.

03:07:09.784 --> 03:07:12.134
MARISHA: Oh, that was almost a natural 20, but
instead it's five.

03:07:12.134 --> 03:07:15.685
TALIESIN: You still have your mote, you can use it
now.

03:07:15.685 --> 03:07:25.754
MARISHA: Are we going to rest on the other side?
It lasts a day. Are we going to sleep on the other side?

03:07:25.754 --> 03:07:26.983
SAM: Maybe.

03:07:26.983 --> 03:07:30.311
MARISHA: Yeah? I'm going to save it. Five.

03:07:30.311 --> 03:07:31.965
TALIESIN: All right, 18.

03:07:31.965 --> 03:07:33.704
SAM: This one's aroused, who knows what's going to
happen.

03:07:33.704 --> 03:07:35.246
(laughter)

03:07:35.246 --> 03:07:36.217
LIAM: Six.

03:07:36.217 --> 03:07:41.320
MATT: All right, so Beau and Caleb, you both take a
point of exhaustion. So you're going to have

03:07:41.320 --> 03:07:43.027
disadvantage on ability checks.

03:07:43.027 --> 03:07:49.265
LIAM: Better constitution than Vax, though.

03:07:49.265 --> 03:07:50.378
SAM: Oh, interesting.

03:07:50.378 --> 03:07:55.022
MATT: All righty. So, pushing forward on this, you
come to a point-- how far ahead of the road of

03:07:55.022 --> 03:07:56.931
them do you want to set up your ambush?

03:07:56.931 --> 03:08:03.549
SAM: Well, we would want them to get going in the
morning, right? But not immediately get ambushed,

03:08:03.549 --> 03:08:08.672
like settle into a little bit of a pace for an
hour or two.

03:08:08.672 --> 03:08:10.719
MARISHA: It's got to be just long enough to where
they're zoning out.

03:08:10.719 --> 03:08:14.003
LIAM: One hour in. 90 minutes.

03:08:14.003 --> 03:08:17.787
SAM: Yeah, somewhere around there. A couple
miles.

03:08:17.787 --> 03:08:20.126
TALIESIN: We'll stop when we see somewhere that
seems advantageous.

03:08:20.126 --> 03:08:21.785
SAM: Yeah, that's the key.

03:08:21.785 --> 03:08:23.006
TALIESIN: If we see something--

03:08:23.006 --> 03:08:24.981
SAM: Oh, it's dark now, right?

03:08:24.981 --> 03:08:27.336
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we've got night vision.

03:08:27.336 --> 03:08:31.246
MATT: 60-foot. Maybe.

03:08:31.246 --> 03:08:33.997
TALIESIN: Anything that we were going to do would
be near the road anyway.

03:08:33.997 --> 03:08:38.997
MATT: Right. So who's taking a look for a good
ambushing point?

03:08:38.997 --> 03:08:40.312
MARISHA: Not me, I'm tired.

03:08:40.312 --> 03:08:41.553
ASHLY: I will.

03:08:41.553 --> 03:08:42.522
SAM: Ooh!

03:08:42.522 --> 03:08:46.857
MATT: So roll for disadvantage because it is
night. Even though you have night vision, it's only

03:08:46.857 --> 03:08:49.057
a short distance.

03:08:49.057 --> 03:08:50.052
ASHLY: Perception?

03:08:50.052 --> 03:08:51.147
MATT: Correct.

03:08:51.147 --> 03:08:54.683
ASHLY: Seven?

03:08:54.683 --> 03:08:57.106
MATT: All right, you find a place--

03:08:57.106 --> 03:08:58.775
(laughter)

03:08:58.795 --> 03:09:04.543
MATT: I mean, it's a road. So you guys have an
evening to-- what do you want to do for your

03:09:04.543 --> 03:09:05.450
ambush?

03:09:05.450 --> 03:09:06.464
SAM: We need to plan the ambush.

03:09:06.464 --> 03:09:07.622
MARISHA: We need to plan.

03:09:07.622 --> 03:09:09.294
SAM: We don't have a cart to block the road with.

03:09:09.389 --> 03:09:11.900
MARISA: We don't have a cleric who can Hold
Person.

03:09:11.900 --> 03:09:13.288
SAM: What do we have?

03:09:13.288 --> 03:09:18.560
ASHLY: Just someone with a lot of sordid history
with these motherfuckers. Skeletons in the

03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:19.800
closet.

03:09:19.800 --> 03:09:22.340
SAM: You could stand in the middle of the road and
distract them.

03:09:22.340 --> 03:09:23.366
ASHLY: Yep.

03:09:23.366 --> 03:09:25.358
MARISHA: That's actually not a bad plan, just in
case.

03:09:25.358 --> 03:09:31.043
LIAM: I would recommend-- they will probably be
traveling pretty close together and I could slow

03:09:31.043 --> 03:09:38.821
them down. Magically speaking. If you were to bait
them a bit and talk to them.

03:09:38.821 --> 03:09:47.968
Then if we pick a trigger point I could cast
Slow... most of them, some of them would make it

03:09:47.968 --> 03:09:49.640
through unscathed, but--

03:09:49.640 --> 03:09:51.375
MARISHA: Would they kill you on sight if they saw
you?

03:09:51.375 --> 03:09:52.634
SAM: What if we did like a--

03:09:52.634 --> 03:09:53.751
ASHLY: I don't know.

03:09:53.751 --> 03:10:00.429
SAM: --like a Red Dawn thing? (laughing) We dug a
hole, and then we got in the hole--

03:10:00.429 --> 03:10:01.669
ASHLY: You had one good idea.

03:10:01.669 --> 03:10:05.804
SAM: --and they came over us and we popped out of
the hole and we grabbed onto the cart and we rode

03:10:05.804 --> 03:10:09.654
under it and then we like chopped a hole in the
bottom of the cart.

03:10:09.654 --> 03:10:12.181
LIAM: What does that have to do with the dawn?

03:10:12.181 --> 03:10:14.303
SAM: It would be really cool!

03:10:14.303 --> 03:10:16.050
TALIESIN: First: do we have any dynamite?

03:10:16.050 --> 03:10:18.631
SAM: Oh! (pause) No.

03:10:18.631 --> 03:10:21.136
MARISHA: We used it on the troll and it did
nothing.

03:10:21.136 --> 03:10:22.948
SAM: Let's figure out what we do have, though.

03:10:22.948 --> 03:10:23.889
LIAM: We have acid.

03:10:23.889 --> 03:10:24.881
TALIESIN: We have acid.

03:10:24.881 --> 03:10:26.031
SAM: We have four vials of acid.

03:10:26.031 --> 03:10:28.738
TALIESIN: Do we have enough Dispel Magic that we
could reveal the cart so we could see it?

03:10:28.808 --> 03:10:31.105
LIAM: Dispel Magic?

03:10:31.105 --> 03:10:33.039
TALIESIN: Yeah, like can you make magic go away?

03:10:33.039 --> 03:10:34.626
LIAM: How would that... what?

03:10:34.626 --> 03:10:37.793
TALIESIN: Magic. Have you never seen anybody do
this before? Just make magic go away?

03:10:37.793 --> 03:10:42.736
LIAM: Yes I can, but what does that have to do
with the cart?

03:10:42.736 --> 03:10:52.088
TALIESIN: They're cloaking the cages. You could
maybe free the people inside the cages with your

03:10:52.088 --> 03:11:00.299
magic hand thing that you do. And if their horses
die those carts aren't going anywhere.

03:11:00.299 --> 03:11:02.371
SAM: Oh! We could just kill all the horses.

03:11:02.371 --> 03:11:03.575
TALIESIN: And then they're stuck.

03:11:03.575 --> 03:11:08.303
LIAM: We may have a split second to-- you want to
try to get these people out immediately, that's

03:11:08.365 --> 03:11:09.269
what you're saying?

03:11:09.269 --> 03:11:10.680
TALIESIN: If they're out, they're helping us.

03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:13.889
MARISHA: Horses aren't a big threat, I would
rather focus on the people.

03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:17.570
TALIESIN: But if we kill the horses, the cart
can't leave.

03:11:17.634 --> 03:11:19.685
MARISHA: Yeah, but if we don't kill the people then
they can kill us.

03:11:19.745 --> 03:11:21.865
TALIESIN: That's fair, too, but they could try and
run.

03:11:21.929 --> 03:11:27.894
MARISHA: These seem like people who are confident
in themselves--

03:11:27.894 --> 03:11:29.136
ASHLY: They don't run.

03:11:29.136 --> 03:11:31.754
LIAM: It was two carts, you said?

03:11:31.754 --> 03:11:33.651
MATT: Three carts, two larger ones and one
smaller.

03:11:33.651 --> 03:11:35.980
SAM: We could just ambush the last one.

03:11:35.980 --> 03:11:42.295
LIAM: I couldn't tell from the aerial view, which
one-- they're all hidden, right?

03:11:42.361 --> 03:11:45.911
MATT: All you saw was just goods in the back.

03:11:45.911 --> 03:11:47.372
TALIESIN: They don't drug their prisoners?

03:11:47.372 --> 03:11:48.975
ASHLY: They tie them up and then gag them.

03:11:48.975 --> 03:11:50.168
TALIESIN: They don't drug them?

03:11:50.168 --> 03:11:51.626
SAM: Do you have anything we could use?

03:11:51.626 --> 03:11:54.910
ASHLY: I have an axe and a hammer. And three
javelins!

03:11:54.974 --> 03:12:03.117
TALIESIN: One last question. How secure are these
carts, or do they just trust that nobody's going

03:12:03.176 --> 03:12:04.947
to get out of the hog tie?

03:12:04.947 --> 03:12:06.249
ASHLY: They're in cages.

03:12:06.249 --> 03:12:10.345
TALIESIN: It's cage, cage, cage? It's not wooden
bottom, wooden top? It's with bars? There's no

03:12:10.345 --> 03:12:11.616
weak point?

03:12:11.616 --> 03:12:17.143
MATT: You haven't inspected them for weak points,
you're not the brightest bulb in the shed

03:12:17.143 --> 03:12:22.720
necessarily when it comes to these things. They're
cages, they're made mostly of metal and they seem

03:12:22.720 --> 03:12:25.910
to hold. They got locks.

03:12:25.910 --> 03:12:29.492
TALIESIN: As long as we can pick some locks, untie
some ropes.

03:12:29.492 --> 03:12:37.376
ASHLY: I think the main-- (heavy sigh)-- The main
person to worry about-- so first of all, Protto is

03:12:37.455 --> 03:12:45.933
the lookout. Disabling him, maybe, if you guys are
trying to be stealthy, would be helpful because

03:12:45.933 --> 03:12:47.042
he's got--

03:12:47.042 --> 03:12:48.405
SAM: --we guys.

03:12:48.405 --> 03:12:49.684
ASHLY: "We guys?"

03:12:49.684 --> 03:12:51.667
SAM: You're part of the team now too.

03:12:51.667 --> 03:13:07.069
ASHLY: We guys. Dwelma is the creepiest and the
craziest, she's the half-orc.

03:13:07.069 --> 03:13:08.448
SAM: Druid.

03:13:08.448 --> 03:13:16.412
ASHLY: Yeah, she's pretty gnarly. I mean, they're
all pretty awful, to be honest.

03:13:16.412 --> 03:13:21.020
SAM: What's our primary goal? Just to stop them
and prevent them from fleeing?

03:13:21.020 --> 03:13:23.883
ASHLY: If we're doing this now, we have to kill
them.

03:13:23.883 --> 03:13:29.581
SAM: Yes, so we have to stop the path, right? We
have to block them from escape. How do we do that?

03:13:29.581 --> 03:13:31.853
Do we fell a tree? Can we fell a tree?

03:13:31.853 --> 03:13:35.142
LIAM: That is a good giveaway, though.

03:13:35.142 --> 03:13:38.214
TALIESIN: Honestly, once the combat starts,
especially if you've got Fireballs, we can just

03:13:38.275 --> 03:13:40.104
make sure those horses are toast.

03:13:40.104 --> 03:13:46.904
MATT: Keeping an eye on the area as you're having
this conversation, you glance around and there's

03:13:46.904 --> 03:13:50.758
an area not too far ahead that you can just see a
little bit of the moonlight breaking through the

03:13:50.758 --> 03:13:59.928
clouds. The snow has not quite arrived yet. But
you can see there are these two small hills that

03:13:59.988 --> 03:14:06.330
flank the sides of the road not far ahead where
you can see there are some boulders that protrude.

03:14:06.330 --> 03:14:15.198
it looks like there is a tree stunk-- stunk?--
tree stump and an old rotted tree that's sitting

03:14:15.198 --> 03:14:16.533
on another one.

03:14:16.533 --> 03:14:19.373
SAM: We could fell the tree right on them as they
come by.

03:14:19.373 --> 03:14:21.045
MARISHA: Ooh.

03:14:21.045 --> 03:14:25.647
MATT: It's not a very big tree. If it were to fall
it would just hit the side of the hill and be on

03:14:25.707 --> 03:14:27.526
the side of the road.

03:14:27.526 --> 03:14:32.241
MARISHA: How rocky are those hills in between?
Could we trigger a rock slide?

03:14:32.241 --> 03:14:38.288
MATT: No, they're not very high, they're maybe
seven, ten feet tall at the highest? And it looks

03:14:38.288 --> 03:14:44.397
like there's been some erosion on the sides where
they've just slipped on certain edges.

03:14:44.397 --> 03:14:47.731
MARISHA: Maybe using Keg as a distraction up
front--

03:14:47.731 --> 03:14:56.215
ASHLY: They probably wouldn't kill me on sight.
Lorenzo likes to make examples of people. So what

03:14:56.215 --> 03:14:58.291
would you guys do if I bought you time?

03:14:58.291 --> 03:15:01.917
SAM: Kill all the horses first so they can't get
away?

03:15:01.917 --> 03:15:03.276
MARISHA: Couple Fireballs.

03:15:03.276 --> 03:15:05.730
TALIESIN: I could teleport into one of the cages
and start untying people.

03:15:05.730 --> 03:15:11.204
SAM: Ooh, that's pretty good. I could also Mage
Hand and start unlocking cages.

03:15:11.204 --> 03:15:15.913
ASHLY: Is there a way that we could split them up
somehow?

03:15:15.974 --> 03:15:19.737
SAM: Okay. How do you propose?

03:15:19.737 --> 03:15:25.060
ASHLY: Not split them up necessarily, but have each
of them occupied.

03:15:25.060 --> 03:15:29.377
MARISHA: Have just certain targets between some of
us?

03:15:29.377 --> 03:15:35.271
LIAM: The best thing that I could do in that
department is Slow, hopefully, all of them down.

03:15:35.271 --> 03:15:43.706
All of them, if they are closely grouped. If not,
I could hold one person.

03:15:43.706 --> 03:15:51.371
SAM: If we're trying to split them up, you could
just slow the last carriage further down the road

03:15:51.371 --> 03:15:54.951
and they'd drift apart a bit, I don't know.

03:15:54.951 --> 03:16:01.027
LIAM: We could, but the way I would do that would
be with a giant, earthen cat paw, which would seem

03:16:01.088 --> 03:16:02.421
out of the ordinary.

03:16:02.421 --> 03:16:03.380
SAM: I see.

03:16:03.380 --> 03:16:08.272
TALIESIN: With you at the top of one hill, if we
get you some cover, and you at the other hill, if we

03:16:08.333 --> 03:16:15.349
give you some cover, giving you both some distance,
the three of us getting into the middle of it,

03:16:15.410 --> 03:16:17.633
coming at them at all sides.

03:16:17.699 --> 03:16:22.931
MARISHA: I could stun somebody depending on how
close I get. Maybe Lorenzo, try and square off

03:16:22.931 --> 03:16:27.910
against him. Of course all the spell-slingers are
good to take out early as well.

03:16:27.910 --> 03:16:34.498
ASHLY: I will say the half-orc has a weird liking
for Lorenzo, so just be prepared if he goes down

03:16:34.498 --> 03:16:37.061
first that she's probably going to go insane.

03:16:37.061 --> 03:16:39.170
MARISHA: Maybe we focus on the druid and the
sorcerer?

03:16:39.170 --> 03:16:44.318
TALIESIN: Always take out the magic users first.
And if we can get a few friends in whoever is in

03:16:44.318 --> 03:16:48.416
those cages, for all we know that's where they've
got our people.

03:16:48.416 --> 03:16:55.572
MARISHA: I feel like if you could hold the
barbarian, keep the barbarian away... I could maybe

03:16:55.572 --> 03:16:59.883
stun Lorenzo and focus down on the rogue and the
druid.

03:16:59.883 --> 03:17:03.331
SAM: Do we have any other weapons or any other
special things?

03:17:03.331 --> 03:17:05.794
TALIESIN: Is there a way to embed a spell into the
ground?

03:17:05.794 --> 03:17:07.246
MARISHA: I have ball bearings.

03:17:07.246 --> 03:17:08.352
TALIESIN: Me too.

03:17:08.352 --> 03:17:11.031
LIAM: On a muddy road, probably not very useful.

03:17:11.031 --> 03:17:15.834
TALIESIN: If they try and climb the hills towards
either of you, you can have some ball bearings to

03:17:15.834 --> 03:17:17.536
help slip them back down.

03:17:17.536 --> 03:17:18.916
SAM: I have a gun!

03:17:18.916 --> 03:17:19.913
(laughter)

03:17:19.913 --> 03:17:23.327
SAM: I stole a gun in the last town we were in. I
stole a gun, I have a gun!

03:17:23.327 --> 03:17:24.452
TALIESIN: I'm going to take the gun.

03:17:24.452 --> 03:17:25.633
SAM: No you're not going to take the gun!

03:17:25.633 --> 03:17:26.702
TALIESIN: I'm taking the gun.

03:17:26.702 --> 03:17:27.658
SAM: No you're not!

03:17:27.658 --> 03:17:28.552
TALIESIN: I'm taking the gun.

03:17:28.552 --> 03:17:29.735
MATT: Okay...?

03:17:29.735 --> 03:17:30.870
TALIESIN: Dex?

03:17:30.870 --> 03:17:35.536
MATT: Both of you make a dexterity check. Well,
this would technically be a grapple, so it would be

03:17:35.536 --> 03:17:37.024
athletics for you--

03:17:37.024 --> 03:17:37.772
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:17:37.772 --> 03:17:40.425
MATT: --and then it would be athletics or
acrobatics for you.

03:17:40.425 --> 03:17:43.857
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm screwed.

03:17:43.857 --> 03:17:46.156
SAM: I'll take acrobatics. It's only 11.

03:17:46.156 --> 03:17:47.748
TALIESIN: It's fine, I'm seven.

03:17:47.748 --> 03:17:50.023
MATT: Completely pulled out of your grasp.

03:17:50.023 --> 03:17:51.667
TALIESIN: Does it even have anything in it?

03:17:51.667 --> 03:17:52.854
SAM: I don't know.

03:17:52.854 --> 03:17:59.119
ASHLY: I'm just going to go out and say we're
probably going to die, guys.

03:17:59.119 --> 03:18:00.232
TALIESIN: We know.

03:18:00.232 --> 03:18:04.004
MARISHA: I have rope. Can we set some sort of
tripwire trap?

03:18:04.004 --> 03:18:05.128
SAM: Sure, sure.

03:18:05.128 --> 03:18:08.549
MARISHA: Is that something you can do? You're good
at finding traps. Are you good at setting traps?

03:18:08.549 --> 03:18:14.800
SAM: First of all, I'm not good at finding traps,
but I've found a few and the ones I've found have

03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:16.260
been rope based.

03:18:16.260 --> 03:18:18.238
MARISHA: With that big swinging log thing!

03:18:18.238 --> 03:18:22.615
SAM: I could do a tripwire... for the horses?

03:18:22.615 --> 03:18:29.668
TALIESIN: There's part of me that's wondering if
we hid you in the downed tree if you could sneak

03:18:29.668 --> 03:18:32.628
in and start working on the cages before they even
know there's a problem.

03:18:32.628 --> 03:18:39.529
SAM: Okay, so we fell a tree in front of the road.
They stop to move it. I'm in there, unlocking things.

03:18:39.529 --> 03:18:43.198
MARISHA: We send Keg to distract. You go in--

03:18:43.198 --> 03:18:44.382
SAM: They've already stopped, though.

03:18:44.382 --> 03:18:48.002
MARISHA: --right, but if they try to go around it
or something. It's just a tree.

03:18:48.002 --> 03:18:49.210
SAM: Sure, sure.

03:18:49.275 --> 03:18:50.404
TALIESIN: Between two hills.

03:18:50.404 --> 03:18:54.188
MARISHA: That's the name of this next chapter of
our journey, you guys.

03:18:54.251 --> 03:18:56.239
SAM: Keg goes in to distract, Caleb kills the
horses.

03:18:56.239 --> 03:18:58.851
MARISHA: No, you go in and try and get the people
out of the cage.

03:18:58.851 --> 03:19:00.517
SAM: Yes, of course.

03:19:00.517 --> 03:19:04.893
MARISHA: But wait, you can't see the cages?
They're magically cloaked?

03:19:04.893 --> 03:19:10.412
MATT: They can't see them, from what you know. From
what Keg told you, they're magically cloaked until

03:19:10.412 --> 03:19:11.838
you get there.

03:19:11.838 --> 03:19:16.221
MARISHA: Until you get there. Maybe you have to be
close enough. You go in, try and get them out. You

03:19:16.221 --> 03:19:23.870
come out, send a signal through Caleb that you're
out, and then Caleb does a big Slow thing, slows

03:19:23.870 --> 03:19:28.538
them down. We go in, punk their asses. We win.
We're victorious.

03:19:28.538 --> 03:19:34.208
SAM: (laughing) This is a great plan. The winning
part especially. Amazing.

03:19:34.208 --> 03:19:35.980
(laughter)

03:19:35.980 --> 03:19:37.782
TALIESIN: If we can pick the locks and untie
everybody.

03:19:37.782 --> 03:19:40.897
LIAM: I am not going to destroy three horses in
one shot.

03:19:40.897 --> 03:19:44.122
MARISHA: No, with Slow. Slow.

03:19:44.122 --> 03:19:45.591
LIAM: I thought we talked about horses as well.

03:19:45.591 --> 03:19:49.243
TALIESIN: We don't need to slow the horses. We
have a tree. If we want, we have a--

03:19:49.243 --> 03:19:54.230
MARISHA: No, we slow the people. Hang on, let me
go through this again. We fell the tree. We send

03:19:54.230 --> 03:19:59.718
in Keg. Keg distracts. We send in Nott. Nott tries
to pick the locks to the cages. Get the people

03:19:59.718 --> 03:20:06.151
out. Nott runs. Nott sends the message to Caleb.
Caleb does the Slow spell on the party. We go in,

03:20:06.151 --> 03:20:11.705
we kick ass, we win, we're victorious. I just said
that 30 seconds ago. Did you guys get it this time?

03:20:11.705 --> 03:20:14.228
LIAM: They come upon a tree and somebody--

03:20:14.228 --> 03:20:16.076
SAM: Are you aroused?

03:20:16.076 --> 03:20:17.682
ASHLY: Yes.

03:20:17.682 --> 03:20:21.065
LIAM: They come upon a tree in the road and a
woman that they despise now, and that is not

03:20:21.065 --> 03:20:22.539
suspicious because?

03:20:22.539 --> 03:20:23.977
TALIESIN: We could put her under the tree.

03:20:23.977 --> 03:20:26.983
MARISHA: No, it is suspicious, but it's
distracting.

03:20:26.983 --> 03:20:30.562
SAM: Ah, help, I'm under a tree! Also, you hate
me.

03:20:30.562 --> 03:20:35.804
TALIESIN: If you find somebody bleeding under a
tree, that's not ridiculous. Tree fell, you

03:20:35.804 --> 03:20:37.406
happened to get hit. Good luck.

03:20:37.406 --> 03:20:40.746
MARISHA: That's dumb. Maybe she's standing on the
tree and she's like, "I'm a badass with an axe and

03:20:40.746 --> 03:20:44.083
"a hammer and I took down this tree and now I'm going
to take down you."

03:20:44.145 --> 03:20:46.815
TALIESIN: We could put you on top of the tree if
you feel like you want to have some words with

03:20:46.815 --> 03:20:47.706
these people.

03:20:47.706 --> 03:20:53.813
LIAM: I am not demanding anything, but my counter
proposal is that I walk 500 yards back along the

03:20:53.813 --> 03:20:59.226
road, put the silver thread across the road so we
know they are coming, spend a few hours hiding

03:20:59.226 --> 03:21:03.018
ourselves at the tops of these hills, waiting.
Nobody is in the road.

03:21:03.018 --> 03:21:04.545
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

03:21:04.545 --> 03:21:10.453
LIAM: We wait until they are just below us. I cast
Slow on them, and then we murder them.

03:21:10.453 --> 03:21:13.441
MARISHA: Then we win, we're victorious. Same
plan.

03:21:13.441 --> 03:21:15.298
SAM and MARISHA: Same plan.

03:21:15.298 --> 03:21:21.355
TALIESIN: You guys work on people--I still think
opening the cages is going to be a good call.

03:21:21.355 --> 03:21:25.443
We'll see what happens.

03:21:25.443 --> 03:21:29.073
LIAM: Well, unless we hear a feasible plan for
doing that first--

03:21:29.073 --> 03:21:31.904
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Plan A--

03:21:31.904 --> 03:21:35.227
LIAM: I say we kick them in the goolies as hard as
we can from the beginning.

03:21:35.227 --> 03:21:40.081
MARISHA: Plan A, you do that. We try to slow them.
If that fails, you're our distraction.

03:21:40.081 --> 03:21:41.917
ASHLY: All right.

03:21:41.917 --> 03:21:47.812
SAM: I'm going to dig a hole just in case. This
Red Dawn thing.

03:21:47.812 --> 03:21:49.624
TALIESIN: I'm all right for this plan.

03:21:49.624 --> 03:21:54.253
LIAM: Actually, I mean, that is a good idea. Could
we spend an-- I'm going to go set my thread across

03:21:54.253 --> 03:21:57.079
the road. Could you make hiding places for all of
us, Nott?

03:21:57.079 --> 03:22:02.942
SAM: Sure. On the tops of the hills, and then one
for me right in the middle of the road under the earth.

03:22:02.942 --> 03:22:12.685
ASHLY: Do I have a sense of what they would do,
were they to reach Shadycreek Run? If they would

03:22:12.685 --> 03:22:15.662
disband at any point, if they would stick
together, where they would take--?

03:22:15.662 --> 03:22:25.118
MATT: No, from what your experience would be, they
would probably go to the hideout, to their little

03:22:25.118 --> 03:22:37.048
homestead deeper into the Savalierwood. They would
drop off their payload and celebrate, probably,

03:22:37.048 --> 03:22:43.804
for an evening of revelry, and then come back the
next day to begin the process of preparing them

03:22:43.804 --> 03:22:47.400
for delivery, which involves breaking them.

03:22:47.400 --> 03:22:54.741
ASHLY: Presumably, there are people in Shadycreek
Run who would love to see them dead.

03:22:54.741 --> 03:22:58.436
MATT: Presumably. There are also people that
would--

03:22:58.436 --> 03:23:00.109
ASHLY: Would help them?

03:23:00.109 --> 03:23:01.421
MATT: --would help them. They have allies.

03:23:01.421 --> 03:23:02.379
ASHLY: Okay.

03:23:02.379 --> 03:23:05.354
MATT: I mean, they're working for one of the tribe
families, so yeah.

03:23:05.354 --> 03:23:06.524
ASHLY: Okay.

03:23:06.524 --> 03:23:07.671
NOTT: All right.

03:23:07.671 --> 03:23:13.361
LIAM:I have seen both of you vanish, so if you put
in a little bit of time and elbow grease, you can

03:23:13.361 --> 03:23:18.703
either find places on these two hills that are
conducive to us hiding or create those situations

03:23:18.703 --> 03:23:21.744
with grass or something, I don't know how to do
it.

03:23:21.744 --> 03:23:23.244
SAM: Yes, absolutely. Let's do it.

03:23:23.244 --> 03:23:24.328
MARISHA: Let's do it.

03:23:24.328 --> 03:23:25.939
SAM: Crafting party.

03:23:25.939 --> 03:23:33.354
LIAM: I'm going to tell Frumpkin to go in the sky
and watch and head up the road a ways to set that alarm.

03:23:33.354 --> 03:23:37.909
MATT: To set the alarm. Okay. I'm going to pull
out the map of the location so you guys can plan

03:23:37.909 --> 03:23:39.092
out positioning.

03:23:39.092 --> 03:23:40.312
MARISHA: Oh, snap.

03:23:40.312 --> 03:23:45.320
SAM: But you can't know the map because we just
came up with this ambush plan tonight. There's no

03:23:45.320 --> 03:23:48.047
way that you would have foreseen something like
this happening.

03:23:48.047 --> 03:23:52.534
MATT: Well, the location of hills, if you were to
use that one. I have multiple--

03:23:52.534 --> 03:23:54.413
LIAM: If he were human, Sam.

03:23:54.413 --> 03:23:57.271
MATT: I have multiple maps prepared depending on
where things happen.

03:23:57.271 --> 03:24:02.714
MARISHA: He's a witch, Sam. You know this. He sees
the future.

03:24:02.714 --> 03:24:04.649
MATT: I have multiple maps with different
scenarios.

03:24:04.649 --> 03:24:07.931
SAM: Can he float?

03:24:07.931 --> 03:24:12.200
TALIESIN: He did move four or five maps into this
building today under cover of tarp.

03:24:12.200 --> 03:24:13.458
SAM: Day?

03:24:13.458 --> 03:24:18.610
MARISHA: It wasn't that undercover. It was Max
going, "No cast is allowed in here for ten

03:24:18.610 --> 03:24:22.437
"minutes!" It wasn't that stealthy. You weren't
here for that.

03:24:22.437 --> 03:24:23.407
SAM: I wasn't.

03:24:23.407 --> 03:24:26.285
TALIESIN: I walked in the green room at one point,
and it was literally the, "No, Mom! Private time!"

03:24:26.285 --> 03:24:28.937
SAM: We have a green room?

03:24:28.937 --> 03:24:30.599
ASHLY: I was going to say.

03:24:30.599 --> 03:24:33.781
TALIESIN: It's that weird room with the weird hair
salon stuff.

03:24:33.781 --> 03:24:35.310
SAM: Oh, the makeup room.

03:24:35.310 --> 03:24:38.790
MARISHA: We should get a mapmaking sock for him.

03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:40.828
SAM: Are we going to do a studio tour at some
point?

03:24:40.828 --> 03:24:45.793
MARISHA: We are. We wanted to film it this week,
but we got super distracted with building the studio.

03:24:45.793 --> 03:24:47.341
ASHLY: (laughs)

03:24:47.341 --> 03:24:52.589
SAM: You know, one of the things about the makeup
room is it has those hair salon sinks where you can get

03:24:52.662 --> 03:24:55.024
a haircut in it or get your hair washed in the sink.

03:24:55.043 --> 03:24:56.586
MARISHA: Taliesin wants to get rid of it.

03:24:56.668 --> 03:24:58.430
SAM: Can I get my hair washed in one of those?

03:24:58.430 --> 03:25:00.131
MARISHA: I want to so bad.

03:25:00.131 --> 03:25:01.848
TALIESIN: Anybody who wants me to shave their
head, I'll do it.

03:25:01.848 --> 03:25:03.166
SAM and ASHLY: Ooh.

03:25:03.166 --> 03:25:05.280
MATT: This is the scenario that you've found.

03:25:05.280 --> 03:25:07.105
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Okay.

03:25:07.105 --> 03:25:11.178
MATT: This is the path heading in a north
direction. These are the two hills. This is the

03:25:11.178 --> 03:25:15.670
tree. How would you like to set this up? How do you
want to do this?

03:25:15.739 --> 03:25:19.171
TALIESIN: (indecisive sound) It's less of a tree than I was
hoping for.

03:25:19.232 --> 03:25:21.413
MARISHA: Nott and I look for the best elements of cover.

03:25:21.413 --> 03:25:27.526
SAM: Can we move some of those bushes up? Up on
top of the hill? Can we snap some twigs and make

03:25:27.526 --> 03:25:29.312
the bushes bigger?

03:25:29.312 --> 03:25:33.504
MATT: I could see you probably do something like
that, sure. You have a little bit of time.

03:25:33.504 --> 03:25:35.228
SAM: Yeah, fluff the bushes a little bit.

03:25:35.228 --> 03:25:39.100
MATT: So where are you going to fluff the bushes
up here? Like what are you doing? Point it out to me.

03:25:39.164 --> 03:25:40.670
SAM: Yeah, let's do that.

03:25:40.730 --> 03:25:42.410
TALIESIN: Here's your paintbrush. Sculpt.

03:25:42.410 --> 03:25:45.881
SAM: Oh my god. We're Minecrafting.

03:25:45.881 --> 03:25:47.051
MATT: (laughs)

03:25:47.051 --> 03:25:47.991
SAM: About there.

03:25:47.991 --> 03:25:48.878
MATT: All righty.

03:25:48.878 --> 03:25:50.134
TALIESIN: I'm so proud you know what that is.

03:25:50.134 --> 03:25:52.673
SAM: And we're going to do that over here a little
bit.

03:25:52.673 --> 03:25:54.702
MARISHA: That's good. That's good.

03:25:54.702 --> 03:25:56.594
SAM: This thing can't move, right?

03:25:56.594 --> 03:25:59.376
ASHLY: We're strong. I'm a beefy boy.

03:25:59.376 --> 03:26:01.093
MATT: You can try. You can certainly try.

03:26:01.093 --> 03:26:02.303
ASHLY: Should I roll something?

03:26:02.303 --> 03:26:05.863
MATT: Make a strength check. This would be
athletics, actually. So make it athletics, because

03:26:05.863 --> 03:26:08.432
this is you, not just lifting it, but also
bringing it along.

03:26:08.432 --> 03:26:09.463
SAM: Holy shit.

03:26:09.463 --> 03:26:10.389
ASHLY: 19.

03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:11.345
MARISHA: Oh, she's fine.

03:26:11.345 --> 03:26:16.844
MATT: You begin to drag it, actually. You watch as
this burly dwarf woman with a five-o-clock shadow

03:26:16.844 --> 03:26:21.460
that is now coming into actual faint stubble grabs it--

03:26:21.574 --> 03:26:23.881
SAM: It's like Rocky IV.

03:26:23.881 --> 03:26:27.293
MATT: --begins just dragging it through this big
groove in the ground as you pull it over. Where do

03:26:27.293 --> 03:26:29.777
you want to put it?

03:26:29.837 --> 03:26:31.168
ASHLY: Is anybody else aroused?

03:26:31.168 --> 03:26:34.510
SAM: --in the middle, or should we-- I'm aroused.
Sam Riegel is.

03:26:34.741 --> 03:26:37.200
MARISHA: You beat me to it. I'm aroused.

03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:40.827
SAM: Should we put it here, to narrow the passage?

03:26:40.827 --> 03:26:42.031
ASHLY: Yeah, that's a good idea.

03:26:42.031 --> 03:26:42.879
SAM: Okay.

03:26:42.879 --> 03:26:44.145
ASHLY: I like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like that.

03:26:44.145 --> 03:26:47.070
TALIESIN: You can also dig a hole right underneath
it too so you can hide--

03:26:47.070 --> 03:26:48.303
ASHLY: And the shrubberies?

03:26:48.303 --> 03:26:50.273
MATT: And you have this tree here.

03:26:50.302 --> 03:26:51.783
SAM: Is this thing hollow at all?

03:26:51.783 --> 03:26:56.145
MATT: That tree is actually somewhat hollow. Not
completely all the way through, but there is an

03:26:56.145 --> 03:26:58.913
alcove in it where some of it has rotted out.

03:26:58.913 --> 03:27:00.600
SAM: That's where I'll hide. Tomorrow.

03:27:00.600 --> 03:27:07.286
MATT: All right. So Nott, I'll go ahead and mark
you as-- this will be where you're hiding, just as

03:27:07.286 --> 03:27:08.407
a note there.

03:27:08.407 --> 03:27:12.567
SAM: Caleb, any other terraforming we want to do
over here?

03:27:12.567 --> 03:27:15.714
TALIESIN: We want to push the tree over, don't we
want to give it a good shove?

03:27:15.714 --> 03:27:16.743
SAM: Are we--

03:27:16.743 --> 03:27:20.719
LIAM: As Caleb comes back from setting the Alarm
spell, tell me what you have worked out so far. I

03:27:20.719 --> 03:27:24.255
set the Alarm spell and I took a wee over that
way.

03:27:24.255 --> 03:27:25.385
ASHLY: (laughs)

03:27:25.385 --> 03:27:31.962
SAM: We added some bush up here and up here-- to
hide in, so then one person can hide here, one

03:27:31.962 --> 03:27:33.413
person can maybe hide here.

03:27:33.413 --> 03:27:35.886
MATT: I'm excited. We've been gone for two weeks.
I'm like, let's do this.

03:27:35.886 --> 03:27:37.229
ASHLY: (laughs)

03:27:37.229 --> 03:27:41.604
SAM: We moved this over and it's got a little nook
in it, so Nott can stay in there.

03:27:41.604 --> 03:27:42.791
LIAM: That's great.

03:27:42.791 --> 03:27:47.418
SAM: But we have this tree here. Do we want to
knock over that tree and block the path?

03:27:47.418 --> 03:27:49.120
MARISHA: You have an awesome axe, right?

03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:50.157
ASHLY: I do.

03:27:50.157 --> 03:27:54.232
TALIESIN: We also have a-- no, we left the axe.
Never mind.

03:27:54.232 --> 03:27:58.343
LIAM: I think that we don't want to gild the lily.
That log is good--

03:27:58.343 --> 03:28:00.106
MARISHA: I enjoy gilding lilies.

03:28:00.106 --> 03:28:01.311
LIAM: --and it makes--

03:28:01.311 --> 03:28:02.874
SAM: How tall is this tree, Matt?

03:28:02.874 --> 03:28:05.596
MATT: That tree is maybe 15 feet, 20 feet?

03:28:05.596 --> 03:28:06.596
SAM: So it only--

03:28:06.596 --> 03:28:08.159
MATT: Actually, that one would be 20 feet tall.

03:28:08.159 --> 03:28:14.302
LIAM: If you come to a road and there's trees
along it, your dander goes up. You're on guard.

03:28:14.302 --> 03:28:16.279
MARISHA: You would think, there was a tornado that
came through here.

03:28:16.279 --> 03:28:22.615
SAM: How about this? If I may. This log that we've
set on this side, what if we set it on this side

03:28:22.615 --> 03:28:23.683
over here--

03:28:23.683 --> 03:28:24.526
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:28:24.526 --> 03:28:27.111
SAM: --and then we weaken the tree in case we need
to tip it over--

03:28:27.111 --> 03:28:28.782
LIAM: Yeah. I'm in favor of that.

03:28:28.782 --> 03:28:30.116
SAM: --and block the other half.

03:28:30.116 --> 03:28:31.718
ASHLY: Should I lift again? Or am I just going
to-- okay great.

03:28:31.718 --> 03:28:32.961
MATT: That you can do.

03:28:32.961 --> 03:28:35.349
SAM: So now we can weaken this tree, maybe, with
some chops and then--

03:28:35.349 --> 03:28:36.600
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can do that angle--

03:28:36.600 --> 03:28:38.105
SAM: --it can block the other half.

03:28:38.105 --> 03:28:40.589
TALIESIN: --you can do that angle so that you can
just hit it and know which side it will fall to--

03:28:40.589 --> 03:28:41.568
SAM: Sure.

03:28:41.568 --> 03:28:42.865
ASHLY: Do I have to roll anything--

03:28:42.865 --> 03:28:44.228
LIAM: You can stick a branch in there--

03:28:44.228 --> 03:28:45.472
ASHLY: --to smack it with my axe?

03:28:45.574 --> 03:28:46.432
SAM: To controlled--

03:28:46.432 --> 03:28:48.255
ASHLY: To controlled smack it with my axe? I'm so
powerful.

03:28:48.255 --> 03:28:49.548
MATT: You can certainly try.

03:28:49.548 --> 03:28:50.631
ASHLY: What do I roll?

03:28:50.631 --> 03:28:52.263
MATT: Go ahead and roll an athletics check for
this one.

03:28:52.263 --> 03:28:54.212
LIAM: And Nott's trap making skills for help?

03:28:54.212 --> 03:28:56.879
MATT: Just--

03:28:56.963 --> 03:28:57.910
ASHLY: 15.

03:28:57.910 --> 03:29:01.920
MATT: 15, okay. So you're able to carve into it,
and use your knowledge of where to hit properly

03:29:01.983 --> 03:29:06.660
and where the strength should be applied, you
manage to cut a few wedges into it. It begins to

03:29:06.660 --> 03:29:08.989
move slightly, and you're like, now's the time to
stop.

03:29:08.989 --> 03:29:10.413
ASHLY: Nice.

03:29:10.413 --> 03:29:15.162
TALIESIN: Um, just for-- no, that would be too
much. I was about to say, I could make a bullshit

03:29:15.162 --> 03:29:19.592
trip wire, that when the tree went down, it would
tighten a rope. It would pop it.

03:29:19.592 --> 03:29:20.746
ASHLY: Hmm.

03:29:20.746 --> 03:29:21.856
SAM: Interesting.

03:29:21.856 --> 03:29:23.505
TALIESIN: It would be rope on the ground. I don't
know if it would hide in that.

03:29:23.505 --> 03:29:24.540
ASHLY: Yeah, it might be too obvious.

03:29:24.540 --> 03:29:25.648
TALIESIN: It might be too obvious.

03:29:25.648 --> 03:29:27.899
MARISHA: I think the best trap we have is Keg
standing behind the tree.

03:29:27.899 --> 03:29:36.611
TALIESIN: Let's, just for fun, I'm going to have
some of our hemp rope already tied around this

03:29:36.611 --> 03:29:42.833
rock, with just a big mess of it ready to go, so
if we need it, we've already got one anchor point.

03:29:42.833 --> 03:29:49.105
SAM: Do we want to do any digging? Any mudding?
Anything else? Is this our ambush?

03:29:49.105 --> 03:29:50.338
MARISHA: Where are you going to hide?

03:29:50.338 --> 03:29:51.376
SAM: Me?

03:29:51.376 --> 03:29:52.294
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:29:52.294 --> 03:29:56.807
SAM: I'm going to be in the log, someone's going
to be up here in bush one, someone's going to be

03:29:56.807 --> 03:29:57.945
in bush two.

03:29:57.945 --> 03:29:59.018
MARISHA: I'll be in bush two.

03:29:59.018 --> 03:30:00.424
SAM: Someone will be behind the tree.

03:30:00.424 --> 03:30:01.374
ASHLY: I'll be behind the tree.

03:30:01.374 --> 03:30:02.765
SAM: Caleb, where are you going to be?

03:30:02.765 --> 03:30:08.255
LIAM: I am going to be way ahead, behind these
bushes, because what I'm going to contribute I can

03:30:08.255 --> 03:30:11.590
do from far away and I can be knocked down like
that, so.

03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:13.248
MARISHA: Molly, are you taking bush one?

03:30:13.248 --> 03:30:14.424
TALIESIN: I'll take bush one.

03:30:14.424 --> 03:30:16.582
MATT: Okay, so Molly, you're going here?

03:30:16.582 --> 03:30:20.070
SAM: Wait, I thought Caleb was the Bush Man.

03:30:20.070 --> 03:30:21.351
(laughter)

03:30:21.351 --> 03:30:22.649
TALIESIN: Caleb's going to be all the way back
there.

03:30:22.649 --> 03:30:24.325
MATT: Beau?

03:30:24.325 --> 03:30:28.263
MARISHA: I'm bush two.

03:30:28.263 --> 03:30:29.586
MATT: Bush two here?

03:30:29.586 --> 03:30:30.572
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:30:30.572 --> 03:30:32.003
MATT: All right. Beau's going to be here.

03:30:32.003 --> 03:30:33.133
MARISHA: These are great codenames.

03:30:33.133 --> 03:30:34.717
MATT: And you're going to be behind the tree?

03:30:34.717 --> 03:30:35.556
ASHLY: Yeah.

03:30:35.556 --> 03:30:36.661
MATT: All righty.

03:30:36.661 --> 03:30:45.342
MARISHA: Do we have a signal as to when we go?
You're going to do the Slow spell, and then we

03:30:45.342 --> 03:30:46.419
fuck shit up.

03:30:46.419 --> 03:30:52.500
LIAM: I'm going to have to improvise. If they can
all be clumped together for the best, but I'm

03:30:52.500 --> 03:30:57.343
going to wait and I'm going to call it in the
moment, if there's two together and not three, I

03:30:57.343 --> 03:30:59.807
will go for two. If all three are together, great.

03:30:59.807 --> 03:31:01.803
SAM: Just dry run it here, dry run it.

03:31:01.803 --> 03:31:03.316
MARISHA: Dry running it.

03:31:03.316 --> 03:31:08.828
SAM: Okay. The cart's coming, it gets slowed. "Oh,
what the fuck's going on?"

03:31:08.828 --> 03:31:11.115
TALIESIN: It gets slowed when it reaches a log.

03:31:11.115 --> 03:31:12.616
LIAM: Oh, I thought they were coming from the
other direction.

03:31:12.616 --> 03:31:13.846
MARISHA: No, this way.

03:31:13.846 --> 03:31:15.846
MATT: That's the north side.

03:31:15.846 --> 03:31:18.697
TALIESIN: I was going to say, either that or you
hid up a rock.

03:31:18.697 --> 03:31:22.010
MARISHA: Do you want to tradesies with Molly?

03:31:22.074 --> 03:31:26.158
TALIESIN: Once the first caravan passes the log.

03:31:26.158 --> 03:31:29.148
SAM: Then Slow it? But it doesn't stop, it just
slows.

03:31:29.148 --> 03:31:30.877
TALIESIN: Does it just slow, not stop?

03:31:30.877 --> 03:31:36.121
MARISHA: Yeah, well, it's called Slow, not Stop.
If it was a Stop spell, it would be called a Stop spell.

03:31:36.121 --> 03:31:39.057
LIAM: The horses will slow, the people will slow.

03:31:39.057 --> 03:31:43.421
SAM: So right here, it slows. They're like, "What
the fuck's going on?"

03:31:43.522 --> 03:31:46.460
ASHLY: We saw that Lorenzo was in the leading
cart, right?

03:31:46.476 --> 03:31:47.506
MATT: The leading cart, yeah.

03:31:47.575 --> 03:31:49.554
MARISHA: How far is your distance?

03:31:49.554 --> 03:31:51.466
TALIESIN: I think we want to be a little further.

03:31:51.466 --> 03:31:53.167
MARISHA: Okay, so, further.

03:31:53.167 --> 03:31:54.024
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:31:54.024 --> 03:32:00.407
MARISHA: I think we want to try and get the Slow
spell off after it's past the log, right?

03:32:00.407 --> 03:32:02.120
SAM: They're already past us, then. We'll stop
them.

03:32:02.120 --> 03:32:06.327
MARISHA: No! Because I'm here, I'm here, Caleb's
here, you're there. Because this will make them

03:32:06.327 --> 03:32:09.773
funnel, which will gather them for Caleb's spell.

03:32:09.773 --> 03:32:12.187
LIAM: And a row of carts, though, not a group.

03:32:12.187 --> 03:32:13.347
MARISHA: What?

03:32:13.347 --> 03:32:18.770
LIAM: It will make for a train, which will not get
them all within what I need. Maybe two of them.

03:32:18.770 --> 03:32:20.831
MARISHA: Why don't you tradesies with me, then?

03:32:20.831 --> 03:32:27.587
LIAM: They're still on a road, they're still
probably going to go, well. The risk of a straight

03:32:27.587 --> 03:32:28.737
line of them.

03:32:28.737 --> 03:32:32.653
ASHLY: How big were they? Would two, three of them
fit in that space?

03:32:32.653 --> 03:32:33.983
MATT: The carts are about that wide.

03:32:33.983 --> 03:32:35.036
ASHLY: Okay.

03:32:35.036 --> 03:32:36.068
MARISHA: How wide is your spell?

03:32:36.068 --> 03:32:37.444
MATT: They'd be going through one at a time.

03:32:37.444 --> 03:32:40.125
MARISHA: Okay. It's a 40-foot radius?

03:32:40.125 --> 03:32:42.041
ASHLY: Do we want them to go through one at a
time?

03:32:42.041 --> 03:32:43.392
LIAM: It is a 40-foot cube.

03:32:43.392 --> 03:32:44.258
SAM: Yeah.

03:32:44.258 --> 03:32:46.060
MARISHA: A cube? I mean, it's a 40-foot cube.

03:32:46.060 --> 03:32:48.757
TALIESIN: They'll always be in a line.

03:32:48.757 --> 03:32:54.987
LIAM: Maybe. It's dicey. It's right on the cusp,
probably, for two or three. Two is better than

03:32:54.987 --> 03:32:57.632
none, slowed down.

03:32:57.632 --> 03:33:02.163
TALIESIN: If the front one is slowed down then
they're all going to be slowed through there.

03:33:02.163 --> 03:33:05.250
SAM: Or we do this, we slow them or whatever, and
then--

03:33:05.250 --> 03:33:06.433
TALIESIN: And now they're ready for a fight.

03:33:06.433 --> 03:33:12.975
SAM: Then they get here, "Oh, crack!" Or maybe we
stop them first, crash, stop, everything stops,

03:33:12.975 --> 03:33:14.927
then we hit them with Slow.

03:33:14.927 --> 03:33:16.306
LIAM: That's great, but they're still in a line.

03:33:16.306 --> 03:33:19.792
MARISHA: Why would they be in a line? You're just
assuming they're going to be in a line instead of

03:33:19.792 --> 03:33:21.270
clumped together.

03:33:21.270 --> 03:33:28.094
LIAM: That's awesome, excuse me, that is fucking
wunderbar. That is wunderbar if they were all

03:33:28.094 --> 03:33:31.964
clumped together, but I'm going to give it a 50/50
chance of them being in a line.

03:33:31.964 --> 03:33:34.537
TALIESIN: If you slow the first cart, then the
other two behind it are not going to be able to go

03:33:34.537 --> 03:33:35.844
any faster, either.

03:33:35.844 --> 03:33:37.062
(metal clanging)

03:33:37.062 --> 03:33:38.171
SAM: Oh, fuck!

03:33:38.171 --> 03:33:41.993
ASHLY: Then we should probably wait until they're
deeper in, and we can attack them, right?

03:33:41.993 --> 03:33:49.896
LIAM: That is true. If they're in a train, we wait
for cart number two to be in that bottleneck, and

03:33:49.896 --> 03:33:54.550
then I try to get the first two. The third one's
not going to go anywhere. What we're losing is--

03:33:54.550 --> 03:34:00.728
the more of these assholes who you used to be a
part of are, it's not just the carts, it's them.

03:34:00.728 --> 03:34:07.158
They can do less to us if I hit them. But you
know, it's not perfect. There's no perfect situation.

03:34:07.158 --> 03:34:09.434
SAM: So should we let one cart go first, and
then?

03:34:09.434 --> 03:34:10.604
LIAM: Yeah.

03:34:10.604 --> 03:34:13.088
ASHLY: I think so. The second cart in the
bottleneck is when we should go.

03:34:13.088 --> 03:34:16.835
TALIESIN: And then we can push the tree on the
first cart. That'll be fun.

03:34:16.835 --> 03:34:18.437
LIAM: Oh, that is a lot of fun.

03:34:18.437 --> 03:34:19.714
SAM: On the first cart?

03:34:19.714 --> 03:34:20.866
LIAM: Ja, on the first one.

03:34:20.866 --> 03:34:27.427
MARISHA: On the first one, you Slow the second
one. We attack, we win. Still winning is part of

03:34:27.427 --> 03:34:29.692
this plan. I just want to make sure that that's
clear.

03:34:29.692 --> 03:34:30.942
LIAM: Thank you, Mr. Sheen.

03:34:30.942 --> 03:34:32.006
MARISHA: Yes.

03:34:32.006 --> 03:34:37.330
SAM: So the first thing that happens is the trunk,
the tree.

03:34:37.330 --> 03:34:38.366
LIAM: Correct.

03:34:38.366 --> 03:34:39.237
ASHLY: Yes.

03:34:39.237 --> 03:34:44.722
SAM: The second thing that happens is Slow. The
third thing that happens is I pop out of the tree trunk--

03:34:44.722 --> 03:34:45.949
MARISHA: Look for our friends.

03:34:45.949 --> 03:34:47.765
SAM: Which cart are they going to be on?

03:34:47.765 --> 03:34:49.275
ASHLY: Do I know that?

03:34:49.275 --> 03:34:50.979
MATT: You have no idea.

03:34:51.299 --> 03:34:55.764
SAM: Which should I start with? The small one or a
big one?

03:34:55.764 --> 03:34:57.381
TALIESIN: The first one, since it's damaged.

03:34:57.381 --> 03:35:02.887
ASHLY: Yeah, there's no way to know. If you go on
the third, then you might be less likely to be seen.

03:35:02.887 --> 03:35:05.355
TALIESIN: Or the first one would be more engaged
with us.

03:35:05.355 --> 03:35:06.327
ASHLY: Or that.

03:35:06.327 --> 03:35:11.061
SAM: Did I give you a scroll of Invisibility?

03:35:11.061 --> 03:35:16.144
MARISHA: Oh yeah, who has that shit? Yeah, you do,
don't you?

03:35:16.144 --> 03:35:21.085
TALIESIN: If you're invisible, you could maybe
help get everybody out.

03:35:21.085 --> 03:35:26.328
SAM: Could you use it on me? Or would that ruin
your books?

03:35:26.328 --> 03:35:35.788
LIAM: No, it won't ruin my books, it's just. I would
only be able to use it this one time, then it's gone.

03:35:35.788 --> 03:35:37.372
MARISHA: Because you haven't transcribed it?

03:35:37.372 --> 03:35:42.436
LIAM: Do you have any paper? Yeah. It would be
gone either way.

03:35:42.436 --> 03:35:45.374
TALIESIN: You wouldn't be able to commit it to
memory and then rewrite it later?

03:35:45.374 --> 03:35:47.183
MARISHA: You're out of paper?

03:35:47.183 --> 03:35:51.857
LIAM: (sighs) No, I mean, I do have a very
near-perfect memory.

03:35:51.857 --> 03:35:52.942
TALIESIN: But it's near-perfect.

03:35:52.942 --> 03:35:54.044
LIAM: Near-perfect.

03:35:54.044 --> 03:35:55.154
MARISHA: But you're out of paper?

03:35:55.154 --> 03:35:56.137
LIAM: Yeah.

03:35:56.137 --> 03:35:57.916
TALIESIN: How long does Invisibility last?

03:35:57.916 --> 03:36:03.008
SAM: An hour?

03:36:03.008 --> 03:36:05.172
MATT: I think it lasts for an hour, or until--

03:36:05.172 --> 03:36:11.424
LIAM: But there's no Slow if there's Invisibility.
Oh, but it's a scroll.

03:36:11.424 --> 03:36:14.862
MATT: Yeah, it ends for a target that attacks or
casts a spell. But it'll last for an hour

03:36:14.862 --> 03:36:16.100
concentration, yes.

03:36:16.100 --> 03:36:20.952
LIAM: I'm popping out of my German accent. If I
cast a concentration spell and then I use a

03:36:20.952 --> 03:36:23.782
scroll, does it drop the concentration check on--

03:36:23.782 --> 03:36:25.696
MATT: Yes it does. It's still you concentrating on
the spell.

03:36:25.696 --> 03:36:28.785
LIAM: I think Slow is more beneficial than
Invisibility.

03:36:28.785 --> 03:36:34.819
TALIESIN: Sure, but if you use the scroll once we
hear the bells, then we've got an hour. Your trap

03:36:34.819 --> 03:36:39.817
goes off, your little alarm goes off,
Invisibility, then you wouldn't drop Invisibility,

03:36:39.817 --> 03:36:41.383
that's not concentration.

03:36:41.383 --> 03:36:42.682
MATT: They both are.

03:36:42.682 --> 03:36:43.659
TALIESIN: Oh, then fine.

03:36:43.659 --> 03:36:44.606
MATT: You can only have one or the other.

03:36:44.606 --> 03:36:46.789
ASHLY: When is the trap going off? When does the
alarm go off?

03:36:46.789 --> 03:36:52.590
LIAM: When they cross the finish line. I've set a
silver thread across the road and if they move

03:36:52.590 --> 03:36:58.627
through that-- Anyone but us who walks through that
line will set it off and I will hear.

03:36:58.689 --> 03:37:00.083
ASHLY: But they won't hear?

03:37:00.083 --> 03:37:01.751
LIAM: No, no, no. It's in here.

03:37:01.751 --> 03:37:03.401
MARISHA: And how many feet ahead did you set that?

03:37:03.401 --> 03:37:05.226
LIAM: I wanted to do--

03:37:05.226 --> 03:37:06.337
MATT: It's like 500--

03:37:06.337 --> 03:37:11.012
LIAM: No, I wanted to do more than that. Let's say
200 yards.

03:37:11.012 --> 03:37:12.268
MATT: Okay.

03:37:12.268 --> 03:37:13.555
SAM: Meters.

03:37:13.555 --> 03:37:17.340
TALIESIN: I like this plan. It's ridiculous.

03:37:17.340 --> 03:37:20.084
MARISHA: So are we doing Invisibility or no?

03:37:20.084 --> 03:37:20.851
TALIESIN: No.

03:37:20.851 --> 03:37:23.166
MATT: Are you guys happy to pull the trigger on
this?

03:37:23.230 --> 03:37:30.227
LIAM: No, I am in favor of Slow over Invisibility.
I want to kill them.

03:37:30.227 --> 03:37:31.619
MATT: Okay then.

03:37:31.619 --> 03:37:32.457
LIAM: Sorry.

03:37:32.457 --> 03:37:40.057
MATT: You have your placements. You've set the
scene. The evening requires some rest, if you're

03:37:40.057 --> 03:37:41.882
to prepare for this by the morrow.

03:37:41.882 --> 03:37:43.441
MARISHA: Yeah, I need to rest, I'm exhausted.

03:37:43.441 --> 03:37:47.632
MATT: So, you set up a small camp here, without
light? Without fire?

03:37:47.632 --> 03:37:58.311
LIAM: To confirm, step one is tree goes down on
cart one, if it's that way, right? Slow happens,

03:37:58.311 --> 03:38:02.244
you can get a sneak attack in if it's an ambush.

03:38:02.244 --> 03:38:10.024
SAM: I'm not going to attack, I'm just going to
jump on a cart in the fracas and try to find a

03:38:10.024 --> 03:38:12.690
cage or two.

03:38:12.690 --> 03:38:16.121
LIAM: And everyone else is going to start
whaling.

03:38:16.388 --> 03:38:18.800
SAM: On people. On magic users.

03:38:18.800 --> 03:38:26.042
LIAM: And that was a blonde pixie cut and a
half-orc? A bald half-orc?

03:38:26.042 --> 03:38:27.978
MARISHA: The sorcerer is the half-elf.

03:38:27.978 --> 03:38:29.415
SAM: Can you?

03:38:29.415 --> 03:38:31.196
TALIESIN: There we are.

03:38:31.196 --> 03:38:32.760
SAM: That's my voice, Ashly.

03:38:32.760 --> 03:38:35.247
ASHLY: It's so beautiful.

03:38:35.247 --> 03:38:37.922
SAM: Up there, in bush land, are you going to be
able to do anything?

03:38:37.922 --> 03:38:42.985
MARISHA: Yeah, I can move 40 feet, my speed. I'm
pretty quick.

03:38:42.985 --> 03:38:49.322
SAM: But that would get you on the cart with the
bad guys. You can't just rain down terror from above?

03:38:49.322 --> 03:38:52.799
ASHLY: That's true, are any of us doing ranged
attacks?

03:38:52.799 --> 03:38:54.434
TALIESIN: We're not ranged people.

03:38:54.434 --> 03:38:56.435
SAM: I'm ranged.

03:38:56.435 --> 03:38:59.800
MARISHA: I've got some pretty dope mobility.

03:38:59.800 --> 03:39:03.669
TALIESIN: And you can do stuff once Slow's cast,
you can also do other things once it's rolling.

03:39:03.669 --> 03:39:11.200
LIAM: Sure, I can dispel any magical stuff going
on in the cages shortly after, or improvise and

03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:12.982
switch to long range destruction.

03:39:12.982 --> 03:39:16.234
TALIESIN: If things look like they're trouble,
we'll just go with it.

03:39:16.234 --> 03:39:24.448
LIAM: Ja, the plan will fuck up I'm sure, but we
will scrap through, or die. Rather than choose who

03:39:24.448 --> 03:39:31.360
we're going to attack in the moment, I saw through
my owl the half-orc with his hood down is a bald

03:39:31.360 --> 03:39:34.394
man. I would say let's look for that one first.

03:39:34.394 --> 03:39:37.819
ASHLY: That's the leader, that's Lorenzo.

03:39:37.819 --> 03:39:42.094
LIAM: That's Liam, not Caleb. Everyone else was
hooded, so we don't know.

03:39:42.094 --> 03:39:46.344
MARISHA: I think Lorenzo is going to be a problem,
because he has reach, and he's a leader.

03:39:46.344 --> 03:39:53.858
LIAM: I would say then that whichever one reveals
them first, either half-orc or woman with a

03:39:53.858 --> 03:39:59.894
pixie cut, whoever reveals themself first, we'll
say that is the one that we all target at the same

03:39:59.894 --> 03:40:07.544
time. We focus our attention to one and kill them,
and they are out of the picture, instead of

03:40:07.544 --> 03:40:08.829
splitting between two.

03:40:08.829 --> 03:40:11.858
MARISHA: If we find that half-orc, druids tend to have
healing abilities.

03:40:11.858 --> 03:40:16.659
LIAM: Ja, but if they don't reveal themselves
first--

03:40:16.659 --> 03:40:20.443
MARISHA: I'm just saying, if they reveal
themselves at the same time.

03:40:20.443 --> 03:40:21.790
TALIESIN: Go for the druid first?

03:40:21.790 --> 03:40:23.792
LIAM: Correct. That's wise.

03:40:23.792 --> 03:40:30.329
TALIESIN: All right. That'll do. We've got a
plan.

03:40:30.329 --> 03:40:38.062
MATT: You're setting up camp without fire for the
evening? Or are you lighting a fire for warmth?

03:40:38.062 --> 03:40:41.819
ASHLY: I feel like we shouldn't.

03:40:41.819 --> 03:40:43.244
MARISHA: I feel like we shouldn't, either.

03:40:43.244 --> 03:40:44.353
SAM: We'll huddle together.

03:40:44.353 --> 03:40:47.465
MARISHA: We share body warmth by all spooning in a
chain.

03:40:47.465 --> 03:40:48.616
TALIESIN: We do set up the tent.

03:40:48.616 --> 03:40:52.961
MATT: You set up the tent behind the hill. You
spoon for warmth.

03:40:52.961 --> 03:40:54.290
ASHLY: I hate it.

03:40:54.290 --> 03:40:57.433
SAM: Who's Lucky Pierre? Who's in the middle?

03:40:57.433 --> 03:40:59.329
TALIESIN: Aren't we all?

03:40:59.329 --> 03:41:01.958
LIAM: Probably Mollymauk.

03:41:01.958 --> 03:41:06.139
TALIESIN: I'm very cold, but yeah, that'll work.

03:41:06.139 --> 03:41:15.448
MATT: You muster through an evening of
uncomfortable but necessary closeness, which, it's

03:41:15.448 --> 03:41:23.056
a very cold night. A faint bit of snowfall greets
you in the morning. Not enough to coat the place

03:41:23.056 --> 03:41:31.641
in white yet. It's these soft little flakes making
their way down. A ways up on the road, a few miles

03:41:31.641 --> 03:41:40.571
out, there is a front of gray heading your way. It
looks to be a wall of snowfall that probably is

03:41:40.571 --> 03:41:46.745
going to be coming about mid-day or so in your
direction. There's some mist in the distance. You

03:41:46.745 --> 03:41:53.191
come to; you shake it off. You're a bit stiff from
a night of not necessarily comfortable rest, but a

03:41:53.191 --> 03:42:02.591
long rest is had. You lose your exhaustion points.
As you take a moment, Caleb, the bells go off.

03:42:02.591 --> 03:42:05.341
SAM: They're already here.

03:42:05.341 --> 03:42:06.383
LIAM: Up, up!

03:42:06.383 --> 03:42:07.887
MARISHA: Do I still have the dodecahedron?

03:42:07.887 --> 03:42:12.751
MATT: You do, if you want. You would have to redo
it again. Whoever wants to do it has to do it now.

03:42:12.751 --> 03:42:15.091
MARISHA: I toss it to Nott.

03:42:15.091 --> 03:42:16.775
SAM: I look in.

03:42:16.775 --> 03:42:21.708
MATT: Okay. You guys aren't treating it like a--

03:42:21.708 --> 03:42:24.390
LIAM: It's totally whippets.

03:42:24.390 --> 03:42:28.176
MATT: Whippets from Xhorhas. This is great.

03:42:28.176 --> 03:42:32.216
LIAM: No, every time it's magical and very
special.

03:42:32.216 --> 03:42:36.496
TALIESIN: I imagine it's a whippet that looks like
the Matrix of Leadership from Transformers.

03:42:36.496 --> 03:42:38.961
(singing) "You got the touch!"

03:42:38.961 --> 03:42:43.351
LIAM: Anytime Caleb does it, he sees all
timelines, but in the interest of brevity--

03:42:43.351 --> 03:42:50.464
MATT: As you guys are in your places, the first
cart comes up.

03:42:50.464 --> 03:42:52.121
TALIESIN: Are we really doing this now?

03:42:52.121 --> 03:42:58.583
SAM: Before we go, I'm going to whisper to Caleb:
Caleb, if anything goes shitty, I'm going to throw

03:42:58.583 --> 03:43:05.101
my flask of oil on the first cart. Light it on
fire.

03:43:05.101 --> 03:43:06.266
LIAM: Understood.

03:43:06.266 --> 03:43:17.203
MATT: All right. As this one comes through, you
notice the person who's guiding it is your friend, Protto.

03:43:17.203 --> 03:43:18.498
SAM: Clarota?

03:43:18.498 --> 03:43:19.536
ASHLY: Protto.

03:43:19.536 --> 03:43:21.306
TALIESIN: Wrong timeline.

03:43:21.306 --> 03:43:29.157
MATT: Continues to push it along, and they
separate as they see the coming pinch of the road.

03:43:29.157 --> 03:43:44.757
Behind that, you see the central one. This has the
one figure that you don't recognize who's driving

03:43:44.757 --> 03:44:00.944
the cart, and walking alongside it is Lorenzo.
This one begins to continue forward, and this

03:44:00.944 --> 03:44:02.228
pushes forward as well.

03:44:02.228 --> 03:44:03.823
SAM: Oh shit! I'm so scared.

03:44:03.823 --> 03:44:06.560
MARISHA: Me too. I'm so scared.

03:44:06.560 --> 03:44:07.985
SAM: Hold me, Ashly!

03:44:07.985 --> 03:44:22.421
MATT: On the sides of this, there is the half-orc
druid. That's Dwelma, and Ruzza, who's the

03:44:22.421 --> 03:44:24.111
half-elf.

03:44:24.111 --> 03:44:26.938
MARISHA: That's the sorcerer. These are the two
magic users.

03:44:26.938 --> 03:44:33.732
MATT: In the back is the small singular cart
that's being ridden by one figure, and there,

03:44:33.732 --> 03:44:43.744
helming the end, is Juam, the human rage-filled
warrior, the one that you've had the better

03:44:43.832 --> 03:44:44.960
experience with.

03:44:44.960 --> 03:44:46.255
MARISHA: The barbarian is a human?

03:44:46.255 --> 03:44:53.420
MATT: Correct. Pushing forward until about there.

03:44:53.420 --> 03:44:54.751
SAM: Come on, Keg.

03:44:54.751 --> 03:44:56.461
ASHLY: Okay. Am I doing this?

03:44:56.461 --> 03:44:57.623
MATT: Are you doing this?

03:44:57.623 --> 03:45:01.042
ASHLY: I'm felling the tree? Okay. Is this a
strength check?

03:45:01.042 --> 03:45:05.776
MARISHA and SAM: (chanting) Keg, Keg, Keg!

03:45:05.776 --> 03:45:08.349
MATT: Roll a strength check.

03:45:08.349 --> 03:45:10.118
ASHLY: That is an 18.

03:45:10.118 --> 03:45:24.740
MATT: The tree immediately falls forward off the
side, snapping at where it was left.

03:45:24.740 --> 03:45:26.197
SAM: How did you have that?

03:45:26.197 --> 03:45:30.146
(laughter)

03:45:30.146 --> 03:45:35.210
MATT: Actually, all of these tree pieces were sent
by our friends at Steamforge as gifts. I was like,

03:45:35.265 --> 03:45:40.567
"I get to use these at some point," and you guys
are using them tonight. Falling and snapping right

03:45:40.567 --> 03:45:48.675
at the front half of the cart, breaking through.
I'm going to give Protto an attempt to try and

03:45:48.675 --> 03:45:53.415
dodge out of the way. He succeeds with a dexterity
saving throw, because he's quite dexterous. He

03:45:53.415 --> 03:45:59.938
jumps back into the front of the cart, and you
watch his lower half vanish as he stops there.

03:45:59.938 --> 03:46:01.998
ASHLY: Am I revealed, or am I hidden by the
stump?

03:46:01.998 --> 03:46:08.763
MATT: You don't know. Actually, that's a valid
point. I'm going to have you guys all roll stealth checks.

03:46:08.763 --> 03:46:10.269
TALIESIN: With advantage, because we had time?

03:46:10.269 --> 03:46:11.687
LIAM: In advance, you mean?

03:46:11.687 --> 03:46:13.481
MATT: Yeah, I'll say in advance.

03:46:13.481 --> 03:46:18.573
ASHLY: Am I at disadvantage? I'm not moving,
though.

03:46:18.573 --> 03:46:22.609
LIAM: Yes, Vax die, yes!

03:46:22.609 --> 03:46:24.064
ASHLY: 12.

03:46:24.064 --> 03:46:25.697
LIAM: 19.

03:46:25.697 --> 03:46:26.669
MARISHA: 20.

03:46:26.669 --> 03:46:27.632
SAM: 18.

03:46:27.632 --> 03:46:28.573
TALIESIN: 20.

03:46:28.573 --> 03:46:34.653
MATT: All of you are pretty stealthy, except for
you. As the tree falls onto the ground, all the

03:46:34.653 --> 03:46:40.845
horses suddenly rear up, and you've actually
broken where the horses are attached to that cart.

03:46:40.926 --> 03:46:42.165
The axel snaps.

03:46:42.165 --> 03:46:43.580
LIAM: That was my trigger.

03:46:43.580 --> 03:46:51.250
MATT: At which point, the carts back up at this
point. There's a shout in the back and you hear

03:46:51.250 --> 03:46:55.723
Protto go like, "Boss, what is--" At which point,
you're doing what?

03:46:55.723 --> 03:47:01.994
LIAM: Slow, and I will target these four assholes
right here, I think I can get in one go, probably.

03:47:01.994 --> 03:47:03.631
40-foot cube.

03:47:03.631 --> 03:47:10.342
MATT: First, for the sake of order here, because
we are engaging in a series of aggressive actions,

03:47:10.342 --> 03:47:11.772
let's all roll initiative, please.

03:47:11.772 --> 03:47:19.615
SAM: Ah! Is that cocked? I can't tell if that's
cocked. I need a ruling from-- oh, it fell.

03:47:19.615 --> 03:47:21.880
LIAM: Roll again.

03:47:21.880 --> 03:47:25.636
MARISHA: Add my boots.

03:47:25.636 --> 03:47:34.467
TALIESIN: Pretty good.

03:47:34.467 --> 03:47:41.603
LIAM: Miss the Percy mega-initiative?

03:47:41.603 --> 03:47:48.027
TALIESIN: Yes. I didn't even really understand how
good I had it. I was so used to being okay no

03:47:48.027 --> 03:47:50.872
matter what, even if I rolled a one.

03:47:50.872 --> 03:47:53.557
MATT: First order of business here for initiative.
I'm going to sit down for this one real fast,

03:47:53.557 --> 03:47:55.875
write it down. 25 to 20, anybody?

03:47:55.875 --> 03:47:57.440
SAM: 21.

03:47:57.440 --> 03:47:58.476
MARISHA: 20.

03:47:58.476 --> 03:48:01.855
TALIESIN: I'm so glad you're first. That's great.

03:48:01.855 --> 03:48:10.076
MATT: Beau and Nott up first. 20 to 15?

03:48:10.076 --> 03:48:11.317
TALIESIN: 18.

03:48:11.317 --> 03:48:14.738
LIAM: 14.

03:48:14.738 --> 03:48:32.766
MATT: 14, you said, Caleb?

03:48:32.766 --> 03:48:34.427
LIAM: Ja, vierzehn.

03:48:34.427 --> 03:48:36.278
MARISHA: A lot of bad guys there.

03:48:36.278 --> 03:48:38.481
MATT: That brings us to--

03:48:38.481 --> 03:48:40.776
LIAM: Evil party, evil party.

03:48:40.776 --> 03:48:45.523
MATT: What'd you get?

03:48:45.523 --> 03:48:49.000
ASHLY: Eight. I'm rolling poop on initiative.

03:48:57.905 --> 03:49:00.387
SAM: Hey, don't leave! We might be ending now!

03:49:00.459 --> 03:49:10.652
MATT: As the tree snaps and hits, he shouts back.
Immediately the group looks out at all sides,

03:49:10.652 --> 03:49:21.590
taking this as a means of assault, Lorenzo
glancing over and directly locking eyes with you,

03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:29.859
Keg. There's a look of taken aback and surprised.
Before any reaction happens, though, you do get

03:49:29.859 --> 03:49:33.949
your action. You are casting Slow, you said?

03:49:33.949 --> 03:49:41.031
LIAM: Indeed I am. Molasses goes across my hand
and I draw my hand down through the air, and I

03:49:41.031 --> 03:49:48.658
focus on these four, if I can. It's a 40-foot
cube, putting this one in a corner.

03:49:48.658 --> 03:49:50.273
MATT: How many can you target with this?

03:49:50.273 --> 03:49:52.078
LIAM: Up to six in a 40-foot cube.

03:49:52.078 --> 03:50:03.138
MATT: Up to six? That'll be quite a lot. You can
get all of these guys, if you want to.

03:50:03.138 --> 03:50:05.366
LIAM: All of them?

03:50:05.366 --> 03:50:11.290
MATT: Well, let's see, because it's (counting) 40,
yeah. This whole section here.

03:50:11.290 --> 03:50:13.267
LIAM: Well, you know, fuck it. Let's also get this
horse.

03:50:13.267 --> 03:50:18.250
MATT: There's six people there.

03:50:18.250 --> 03:50:20.137
LIAM: Oh, there's six of them? Oh, wow, yes!

03:50:20.137 --> 03:50:22.724
MATT: There's the one who's helming this horse,
the one who's helming these horses, the back of

03:50:22.724 --> 03:50:23.994
the cart, and then those four.

03:50:23.994 --> 03:50:26.605
LIAM: Yes, never mind. I didn't think we were
getting all of those people. Good. All of the humanoids.

03:50:26.605 --> 03:50:34.204
MATT: For the two thugs that are on the horses,
two and a three. Natural two and a three. They are

03:50:34.204 --> 03:50:36.328
both slowed.

03:50:36.328 --> 03:50:39.773
TALIESIN: What does Slow mean, by the way?

03:50:39.773 --> 03:50:46.724
LIAM: Half speed, negative two to armor class, no
reactions, and they can either do an action or a

03:50:46.724 --> 03:50:48.601
bonus action; they can't do both.

03:50:48.601 --> 03:50:49.867
TALIESIN: Oh my god, that's amazing.

03:50:49.867 --> 03:50:56.245
LIAM: They can attempt to cast a spell, but--

03:50:56.245 --> 03:50:59.463
TALIESIN: That means you can attack and then
disengage for free. That's amazing!

03:50:59.463 --> 03:51:04.835
MATT: Ruzza does not succeed. Ruzza is slowed.

03:51:04.835 --> 03:51:09.167
MARISHA: Ruzza, the sorcerer! Did the druid save?

03:51:09.167 --> 03:51:20.555
MATT: The druid does save. The barbarian-- the
barbarian does not save.

03:51:20.555 --> 03:51:23.252
MARISHA: The druid saved, Dwelma.

03:51:23.252 --> 03:51:30.063
MATT: And Lorenzo-- that is a 17. Saves.

03:51:30.063 --> 03:51:32.474
MARISHA: That's pretty dope, though.

03:51:32.474 --> 03:51:45.092
MATT: This all happens. Combat has begun. Starting
at the top of the combat order: Beau, you're up first.

03:51:45.092 --> 03:51:49.745
MARISHA: No, Nott is. Nott rolled a 21 and I
rolled a 20.

03:51:49.745 --> 03:51:52.517
MATT: Oh! Got you. I put them in the wrong order.

03:51:52.517 --> 03:51:57.501
SAM: We're starting this? I don't know how I'm
going to get on this fucking cart! How am I going to

03:51:57.560 --> 03:51:59.348
get on this cart? I'm not invisible!

03:51:59.348 --> 03:52:01.607
LIAM: Your charisma, Sam! Your charisma.

03:52:01.607 --> 03:52:18.429
SAM: All right. I'll run past Lorenzo. As I run, I
will dump all my oil on him.

03:52:18.429 --> 03:52:21.076
MATT: Okay, that's your action.

03:52:21.076 --> 03:52:22.747
SAM: Yep, that's my action.

03:52:22.747 --> 03:52:28.306
MATT: (splashing) He looks at it, sees you dart
by.

03:52:28.306 --> 03:52:30.445
SAM: Bonus action disengage.

03:52:30.445 --> 03:52:33.282
MATT: Okay. He can't make an attack of opportunity
on you.

03:52:33.282 --> 03:52:36.446
SAM: And jump into the cart and start doing this.

03:52:36.446 --> 03:52:38.195
MATT: This big one there?

03:52:38.195 --> 03:52:39.335
SAM: Yeah.

03:52:39.335 --> 03:52:43.263
MATT: You dart in, and as soon as your vision
comes through, you come face-to-face with a metal cage.

03:52:43.263 --> 03:52:44.367
SAM: Oh, shit!

03:52:44.367 --> 03:52:50.460
MATT: Right there in front of you. For you who can
watch, the back half of Nott is still visible. The

03:52:50.460 --> 03:52:54.053
entire cart is filled with cages. Front to back.

03:52:54.053 --> 03:52:55.772
SAM: They're invisible cages?

03:52:55.772 --> 03:52:58.564
MATT: The cages are blanketed by some sort of
illusion.

03:52:58.564 --> 03:53:00.767
SAM: The part of me that hit the cage is now
invisible also?

03:53:00.767 --> 03:53:06.618
MATT: Correct, but just the front half. It looks
like Nott vanishes partway through, like you've

03:53:06.618 --> 03:53:14.657
stepped through part of a doorway. On the inside,
you see a very sweaty human man who is gagged and

03:53:14.657 --> 03:53:18.736
leaned up against the cage like, (whines). He
looks up towards you.

03:53:18.736 --> 03:53:20.309
SAM: That's all I've got.

03:53:20.309 --> 03:53:21.394
MATT: That's all you've got.

03:53:21.394 --> 03:53:25.195
TALIESIN: Can you get a little bit more around
the-- or is that all your movement?

03:53:25.195 --> 03:53:26.765
SAM: I'm sure I pushed as far as I could.

03:53:26.765 --> 03:53:31.812
MARISHA: Okay. I'm probably more than 40 feet away
from the druid?

03:53:31.812 --> 03:53:40.695
MATT: You can just get to the druid at 40 feet.
(counting) You do have to get down there.

03:53:40.695 --> 03:53:42.617
MARISHA: Sweet jump.

03:53:42.617 --> 03:53:46.679
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

03:53:46.679 --> 03:53:50.061
SAM: Come on, this is what you live for!

03:53:50.061 --> 03:53:52.208
MARISHA: It is what I live for! Ten!

03:53:52.208 --> 03:53:57.567
MATT: You manage to land without losing your
footing. You get right up to the druid there.

03:53:57.567 --> 03:54:11.821
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. Okay. Two attacks. First
attack, okay! That's a natural 16, plus seven is

03:54:11.821 --> 03:54:15.758
21. Right? 16 plus seven?

03:54:15.758 --> 03:54:17.023
TALIESIN: 21.

03:54:17.023 --> 03:54:20.233
MARISHA: 21, and that's eight damage.

03:54:20.233 --> 03:54:21.380
MATT: That is.

03:54:21.380 --> 03:54:23.261
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point to do
Stunning Strike.

03:54:23.261 --> 03:54:30.448
MATT: That is a natural 15 plus three is 18.

03:54:30.448 --> 03:54:32.187
MARISHA: That really sucks.

03:54:32.187 --> 03:54:34.255
SAM: You've got ball bearings!

03:54:34.255 --> 03:54:37.297
MARISHA: I do have ball bearings. Take my second
hit.

03:54:37.297 --> 03:54:38.372
MATT: Go for it.

03:54:38.372 --> 03:54:43.285
MARISHA: That's 20 total.

03:54:43.285 --> 03:54:45.619
MATT: 20 total? Okay.

03:54:45.619 --> 03:54:51.726
MARISHA: Yeah. Another eight damage. I'm going to
spend another ki point to try Stunning Strike again.

03:54:51.821 --> 03:54:53.251
MATT: All righty.

03:54:53.251 --> 03:54:54.973
MARISHA: What was that, plus three?

03:54:54.973 --> 03:54:57.264
MATT: 15. What's the DC?

03:54:57.264 --> 03:54:58.614
MARISHA: 14.

03:54:58.614 --> 03:55:01.192
LIAM: Nope.

03:55:01.192 --> 03:55:02.590
SAM: It's a perfect plan.

03:55:02.590 --> 03:55:07.194
MARISHA: I'm burning through so many ki points.

03:55:07.194 --> 03:55:08.896
SAM: It's now or never.

03:55:08.896 --> 03:55:13.067
MARISHA: I'm going to spend one more ki point to
do Patient Defense because I'm probably going to

03:55:13.234 --> 03:55:14.454
need it now.

03:55:14.454 --> 03:55:16.998
MATT: Okay, going into defensive mode. That
finishes Beau's go.

03:55:16.998 --> 03:55:19.127
MARISHA: Three ki points! Burning them out.

03:55:19.127 --> 03:55:21.472
SAM: Ki questions.

03:55:21.472 --> 03:55:24.254
MATT: All right. It's now Ruzza's turn, who is
slowed.

03:55:24.254 --> 03:55:32.037
LIAM: If you attempt to cast a spell with a
casting time of one action--

03:55:32.037 --> 03:55:33.642
MATT: It doesn't go off until the next turn.

03:55:33.642 --> 03:55:34.608
LIAM: Right.

03:55:34.608 --> 03:55:36.165
SAM: Wow, Slow is the best!

03:55:36.165 --> 03:55:48.718
MATT: Ruzza's going to step back, looking towards
Lorenzo, and goes, "Boss, this is so weird." It's

03:55:48.718 --> 03:55:52.445
weird to hear this slowed-down, deeper voice
coming out of this female half-elf, but

03:55:52.513 --> 03:56:02.694
nevertheless, here we are. As she steps away and
begins-- She does give a bit of bardic inspiration

03:56:02.694 --> 03:56:06.608
to Lorenzo, because she's technically not a
sorcerer.

03:56:06.608 --> 03:56:10.835
SAM: Not a sorcerer?! You got it wrong!

03:56:10.835 --> 03:56:13.225
MATT: That's as much as you know.

03:56:13.281 --> 03:56:17.054
TALIESIN: Is that a bonus action, though? You have
to do an action or a bonus action, you can't do both.

03:56:17.054 --> 03:56:19.668
MATT: Oh, that's right! So they're not doing
that.

03:56:19.668 --> 03:56:22.910
LIAM: Read the cards, people! Read the cards!

03:56:22.910 --> 03:56:26.613
TALIESIN: No dubstep today. No wub wub.

03:56:26.613 --> 03:56:35.147
MATT: Still saying that phrase, but not in an
inspirational way. Is going to cast, glancing over

03:56:35.147 --> 03:56:37.390
in your direction as the source of it.

03:56:37.390 --> 03:56:40.561
LIAM: Knew where I was? My stealth was that
shitty?

03:56:40.561 --> 03:56:45.717
MATT: Once you cast the spell you reveal yourself,
buddy. That's how it works, unfortunately.

03:56:45.717 --> 03:56:47.373
SAM: The cover of bush?

03:56:47.373 --> 03:56:48.543
ASHLY: He's bushman!

03:56:48.543 --> 03:56:49.816
SAM: Yeah, we had him all bushed.

03:56:49.816 --> 03:56:54.694
LIAM: I'm going to die. It's fine.

03:56:54.694 --> 03:56:59.586
MATT: This is going to be-- Yeah, let's do some
Hypnotic Pattern. Why not?

03:56:59.586 --> 03:57:03.226
SAM: He'll resist it.

03:57:03.226 --> 03:57:17.487
MATT: He begins (slow incantation) and slowly
backs to here, getting up on the hill, climbing to

03:57:17.487 --> 03:57:22.237
get some better visual perspective over the
battlefield. That's going to end Ruzza's turn,

03:57:22.237 --> 03:57:23.660
Molly, you're up.

03:57:23.660 --> 03:57:28.291
TALIESIN: I look at Keg and: You got that one?

03:57:28.291 --> 03:57:30.319
ASHLY: Yeah.

03:57:30.319 --> 03:57:41.178
TALIESIN: Right. I'm going to start my movement.
I've got 30 feet of movement. I can get almost to

03:57:41.178 --> 03:57:42.752
the edge of this mountain, right?

03:57:42.752 --> 03:57:43.886
MATT: You can get right there.

03:57:43.886 --> 03:57:44.674
TALIESIN: That's 30 feet?

03:57:44.674 --> 03:57:45.542
MATT: That's 30 feet there.

03:57:45.542 --> 03:57:47.009
TALIESIN: Then I can teleport how far?

03:57:47.009 --> 03:57:47.995
MATT: 30 feet.

03:57:47.995 --> 03:57:49.605
TALIESIN: Can I get to flanking?

03:57:49.605 --> 03:57:53.923
MATT: Flanking? To there, you mean?

03:57:53.923 --> 03:57:56.278
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

03:57:56.278 --> 03:57:57.495
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

03:57:57.495 --> 03:58:02.004
TALIESIN: Is that way more than-- I have a 30 foot
teleport, right?

03:58:02.004 --> 03:58:02.841
MATT: Yeah.

03:58:02.841 --> 03:58:05.594
TALIESIN: Is it possible to do it halfway through
my movement so I still have two steps that I can

03:58:05.594 --> 03:58:12.109
take? No, never mind. Eff it, I'm good. I'm not
going to fight it. I'm going to take two attacks.

03:58:12.109 --> 03:58:13.264
SAM: Yes!

03:58:13.264 --> 03:58:14.254
MATT: Go for it.

03:58:14.254 --> 03:58:15.346
TALIESIN: I have advantage.

03:58:15.346 --> 03:58:16.350
MATT: You do.

03:58:16.350 --> 03:58:17.136
TALIESIN: All right.

03:58:17.136 --> 03:58:18.499
MATT: I assume you had your rites prepared.

03:58:18.499 --> 03:58:19.633
TALIESIN: Both are up.

03:58:19.633 --> 03:58:21.943
SAM: Come on, motherfucker!

03:58:21.943 --> 03:58:33.392
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's 19. Yeah, that hits. The
first one is awful: seven points of damage.

03:58:33.392 --> 03:58:35.515
MATT: Seven points of damage? All righty.

03:58:35.515 --> 03:58:43.786
TALIESIN: Second one is 16, 17, yeah, that's 16
plus seven.

03:58:43.786 --> 03:58:45.225
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

03:58:45.225 --> 03:58:48.933
TALIESIN: That's better. 12 points of damage.

03:58:48.933 --> 03:58:59.356
MATT: 12 points of damage! You're carving through.
She's not slowed by the impact of the spell and

03:58:59.356 --> 03:59:05.730
taking these wounds, hurting her quite a bit.
She's not horribly maimed, but is starting to show

03:59:05.730 --> 03:59:23.613
some wear from the strikes that she's suffered.
That ends your turn. That brings us to Lorenzo. Hmm.

03:59:23.613 --> 03:59:25.046
SAM: Wow, we stumped him.

03:59:25.046 --> 03:59:26.738
MARISHA: I know, so quiet!

03:59:26.738 --> 03:59:33.938
SAM: The only good plan that we've ever made is
without Travis and Laura here. Let's make that clear.

03:59:33.938 --> 03:59:41.614
MARISHA: I'm still stoked on our-- was it
Umbrasyl? The frost dragon?

03:59:41.614 --> 03:59:42.937
TALIESIN: That was pretty solid.

03:59:42.937 --> 03:59:44.173
SAM: Are you doing a throwback right now?

03:59:44.173 --> 03:59:45.353
MARISHA: Yes, I am.

03:59:45.353 --> 03:59:47.484
LIAM: Vorugal was the frost. Umbrasyl was black
acid.

03:59:47.484 --> 03:59:49.931
MARISHA: When Vorugal fought Yenk.

03:59:49.931 --> 03:59:57.020
MATT: Lorenzo, watching you and your friends,
shouts out in your direction and goes--

03:59:57.020 --> 03:59:59.221
LIAM: Slowed.

03:59:59.221 --> 04:00:00.366
MATT: Well, he's not slowed.

04:00:00.366 --> 04:00:01.400
LIAM: Oh, he saved.

04:00:01.400 --> 04:00:11.211
MATT: "Keg! I don't know what you're trying here,
but I think the line's been drawn." He's going to

04:00:11.211 --> 04:00:18.498
step over here, pushing through the horses,
leaping over in the direction of where Nott is

04:00:18.498 --> 04:00:34.939
there and is going to shout out, "Hey! Move
aside!" and holds his hand out in front of him.

04:00:34.939 --> 04:00:37.408
That's going to end his turn.

04:00:37.408 --> 04:00:38.364
SAM: Oh no.

04:00:38.364 --> 04:00:39.459
LIAM: He's casting!

04:00:39.459 --> 04:00:43.160
SAM: He can cast?! I thought you said he was a
fighter! Your information is the worst!

04:00:43.160 --> 04:00:45.472
ASHLY: I'm not very smart!

04:00:45.472 --> 04:00:53.046
MATT: Protto is currently like freaking out by
this, sees this all happening, narrowingly missed

04:00:53.113 --> 04:00:59.856
the tree slamming into him, goes and pulls out his
bow and nocks an arrow into it and is going to

04:00:59.856 --> 04:01:05.994
take a shot. Let's see, the one he saw dart that
way's going to be Molly. He's going to fire at Molly.

04:01:06.010 --> 04:01:09.570
TALIESIN: He's going to have a hard time doing
that. Disadvantage.

04:01:09.570 --> 04:01:10.905
MATT: What's the range on it?

04:01:10.905 --> 04:01:12.965
TALIESIN: Of my Blood Maledict?

04:01:12.965 --> 04:01:14.115
MATT: Yeah.

04:01:14.115 --> 04:01:18.260
TALIESIN: Let's see. I'm not looking at the right
thing. Where is it?

04:01:18.260 --> 04:01:20.651
MATT: Is it a 30 or 60 foot range?

04:01:20.651 --> 04:01:24.739
TALIESIN: Blood Maledict!

04:01:24.739 --> 04:01:27.513
MATT: For your Blood Curse of the Eyeless?

04:01:27.513 --> 04:01:28.948
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's 60 feet!

04:01:28.948 --> 04:01:30.516
MATT: 60 feet? Yeah, that'll do it!

04:01:30.516 --> 04:01:31.510
TALIESIN: Amplified.

04:01:31.510 --> 04:01:35.396
MATT: Amplified, so disadvantage on-- He gets two
strikes.

04:01:35.396 --> 04:01:38.522
TALIESIN: Yeah, I take a lot of damage for that.
Five points of damage.

04:01:38.522 --> 04:01:44.912
MATT: First one with disadvantage is going to be
16 to hit? What's your armor class?

04:01:44.912 --> 04:01:46.256
TALIESIN: For fuck's sake! 15.

04:01:46.256 --> 04:01:51.920
MATT: 15, so that hits. Because you're adjacent to
an ally of his, he gets sneak attack bonus on that.

04:01:51.920 --> 04:01:53.875
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it!

04:01:53.875 --> 04:01:55.588
SAM: Rogues are the worst.

04:01:55.657 --> 04:01:56.677
MATT: That's going to put him--

04:01:56.677 --> 04:01:58.088
LIAM: Slash the best!

04:01:58.088 --> 04:02:05.560
MATT: To be fair, it's a shitty sneak attack roll.
That's a total of 14 points of piercing damage

04:02:05.560 --> 04:02:08.617
from the first arrow into your shoulder.

04:02:08.617 --> 04:02:09.734
TALIESIN: All right.

04:02:09.734 --> 04:02:10.903
MATT: The other one is going to be--

04:02:10.903 --> 04:02:18.836
TALIESIN: Did he get disadvantage on the other
attack as well?

04:02:18.836 --> 04:02:19.866
MATT: He did, yeah.

04:02:19.866 --> 04:02:20.733
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:02:20.733 --> 04:02:21.912
MATT: 16, on this one.

04:02:21.912 --> 04:02:22.764
SAM: Oh!

04:02:22.764 --> 04:02:23.615
TALIESIN: 16?

04:02:23.615 --> 04:02:25.254
MATT: Because it was an 11 and a ten he rolled
and it's plus six on his attacks.

04:02:25.328 --> 04:02:27.654
TALIESIN: Okay, so they both hit.

04:02:27.716 --> 04:02:30.052
MATT: Okay, the other one just deals six points of
piercing damage.

04:02:30.121 --> 04:02:32.445
SAM: Oh, that wasn't damage. I thought that was
damage, okay.

04:02:32.546 --> 04:02:44.330
MATT: He's going to jump off and move over here,
up onto the top to get a good view since he's a

04:02:44.401 --> 04:02:47.045
ranged guy with his arrows. He's keeping down and
getting ready for that.

04:02:47.045 --> 04:02:49.795
MARISHA: No, I ran over there. I'm fighting the
druid!

04:02:49.795 --> 04:02:51.152
SAM: Oh, you ditched. That's fine.

04:02:51.152 --> 04:03:01.660
MATT: That's going to go ahead and-- that was his
action surge and everything, so he's done. Next

04:03:01.660 --> 04:03:05.164
up. Bear with me, guys. There is a lot going on
right here.

04:03:05.164 --> 04:03:08.361
SAM: Yeah, there's 12 players.

04:03:08.361 --> 04:03:10.101
MATT: Caleb, your turn.

04:03:10.101 --> 04:03:11.502
LIAM: We're back to me?

04:03:11.502 --> 04:03:15.592
MATT: Yeah, you had the ambush round technically
because it was the trigger, Slow, and then

04:03:15.592 --> 04:03:23.137
everything happened at once. The tree triggered
the ambush seeing you, so the only one who got a

04:03:23.137 --> 04:03:25.526
round off was you for the spell.

04:03:25.526 --> 04:03:30.412
LIAM: I cast Dispel Magic on the cages or I could
attack the person about to attack me.

04:03:30.412 --> 04:03:32.864
MARISHA: Who's going to attack you?

04:03:32.864 --> 04:03:39.655
LIAM: That's what I would do. I will use the Glove
of Blasting to fire on the person attacking me.

04:03:39.714 --> 04:03:40.796
SAM: Which one?

04:03:40.796 --> 04:03:41.724
TALIESIN: The one on the hill.

04:03:41.724 --> 04:03:42.674
LIAM: The one on the hill.

04:03:42.674 --> 04:03:43.508
MARISHA: The sorcerer.

04:03:43.508 --> 04:03:44.236
LIAM: Yeah.

04:03:44.236 --> 04:03:45.978
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll for attacks on that.

04:03:45.978 --> 04:03:47.635
LIAM: Yeah, three of those.

04:03:47.635 --> 04:03:48.833
MATT: Minus two to their armor class.

04:03:48.833 --> 04:03:52.364
LIAM: First one does not hit, that is a 12.

04:03:52.364 --> 04:03:53.805
MATT: Goes wide.

04:03:53.805 --> 04:04:01.337
LIAM: Second is-- Sorry. 17?

04:04:01.337 --> 04:04:02.613
MATT: 17 hits.

04:04:02.613 --> 04:04:06.097
LIAM: Oh, it was 16 on the last one! Does that
hit?

04:04:06.097 --> 04:04:07.109
MATT: That would hit!

04:04:07.109 --> 04:04:11.567
LIAM: Thank you! The third one definitely misses.
That's a two plus eight, that's ten.

04:04:11.567 --> 04:04:13.299
MATT: Okay, so two hits. It's 4d6.

04:04:13.299 --> 04:04:14.891
LIAM: 4d6.

04:04:14.891 --> 04:04:16.446
MATT: Not a bad opening round.

04:04:16.446 --> 04:04:25.686
LIAM: Not that great. Ten damage, fire damage.
They have to make a constitution save?

04:04:25.686 --> 04:04:29.565
MATT: Yes. To maintain?

04:04:29.565 --> 04:04:33.792
LIAM: Oh, they were casting an attack. Well, I
don't know what they were casting.

04:04:33.792 --> 04:04:37.422
MATT: They still have to make a concentration
check to see if they can finish with their

04:04:37.422 --> 04:04:43.567
casting, yeah. That is a 13 plus two. That is a
15. So yeah, they're fine.

04:04:43.567 --> 04:04:44.745
LIAM: Yeah, they're fine.

04:04:44.745 --> 04:04:48.174
MATT: Is that the end of your turn, Caleb? Staying
where you are?

04:04:48.174 --> 04:04:54.789
LIAM: I will lie down flat on my back.

04:04:54.789 --> 04:05:03.447
MATT: Okay! You go prone? Caleb goes prone. Okay,
now it's the thugs' turn. They are slowed, so they

04:05:03.447 --> 04:05:10.939
can't move too far. This one is going to move
back. That's as far as he can move, and he's going

04:05:10.939 --> 04:05:15.001
to pull out his crossbow and he gets one shot,
because of the Slow spell. He's going to take it

04:05:15.001 --> 04:05:21.688
towards you, Caleb, with disadvantage because
you're so far away.

04:05:21.688 --> 04:05:22.984
TALIESIN: And prone.

04:05:22.984 --> 04:05:29.340
MATT; Yeah, you're still within the minimum
distance, so with disadvantage regardless. That

04:05:29.340 --> 04:05:35.435
is, with disadvantage, a 13. What's your armor
class?

04:05:35.435 --> 04:05:37.281
LIAM: Shield. It doesn't hit.

04:05:37.281 --> 04:05:44.658
MATT: The bolt goes wide. This guy here is also
slowed. He's going to attempt to back away.

04:05:44.658 --> 04:05:46.823
SAM: Do the horses get an attack of opportunity?

04:05:46.823 --> 04:05:55.494
MATT: They do not. He's going to attempt to use
the edge of the tree for some cover as he takes a

04:05:55.494 --> 04:05:57.787
shot at Beau.

04:05:57.787 --> 04:06:00.570
MARISHA: Disadvantage.

04:06:00.570 --> 04:06:04.947
MATT: Yep. And that is going to be a 13 again!

04:06:04.947 --> 04:06:09.879
MARISHA: Miss, yeah.

04:06:09.879 --> 04:06:13.074
SAM: We're still alive!

04:06:13.074 --> 04:06:21.550
MATT: Now it is Juam's turn, who is slowed, and
right here, next to Caleb, is going to take a

04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:34.720
strike at you. Not technically-- only gets one
attack, so the first one would've been 12.

04:06:34.720 --> 04:06:36.299
TALIESIN: Yeah, nope.

04:06:36.299 --> 04:06:41.999
MATT; Spends 15 feet of movement backing away
there, as the boss said. You do get an attack of

04:06:41.999 --> 04:06:43.328
opportunity if you'd like to take it.

04:06:43.328 --> 04:06:44.715
TALIESIN: I used my reaction.

04:06:44.715 --> 04:06:46.127
MATT: Oh, you did! That's right, you do not.

04:06:46.127 --> 04:06:50.249
TALIESIN: Do I still have a second Blood Maledict,
by the way, this round? I can spend another round

04:06:50.249 --> 04:06:55.853
doing it. I know we changed the rules slightly. At
fifth level, do I get two uses or just two options?

04:06:55.853 --> 04:06:57.408
MATT: I'll have to double check.

04:06:57.408 --> 04:06:58.637
TALIESIN: All right. When we get there.

04:06:58.637 --> 04:07:03.322
MATT: That's the two thugs' turns. That's Juam's
turn. Keg, you're up.

04:07:03.322 --> 04:07:07.445
SAM: All right, Keg! Kill them all in one turn!
From 45 feet away.

04:07:07.445 --> 04:07:17.949
ASHLY: I feel like narratively, Keg is actually
pretty freaked right now. Is it weird to ever give

04:07:17.949 --> 04:07:21.822
yourself disadvantage on things narratively?

04:07:21.822 --> 04:07:24.315
MATT: No, it makes sense! We've all done it to
some degree.

04:07:24.315 --> 04:07:26.626
LIAM: It's Sam's raison d'être.

04:07:26.626 --> 04:07:32.074
ASHLY: Okay, so I'm going to give myself
disadvantage on everything I'm going to try to do

04:07:32.074 --> 04:07:37.306
this turn, because seeing Lorenzo again I think
has really freaked Keg out.

04:07:37.306 --> 04:07:41.235
SAM: He is covered in oil, which makes him kind of
sexy.

04:07:41.235 --> 04:07:44.004
ASHLY: I'm aroused and scared?

04:07:44.004 --> 04:07:48.256
MATT: Which, the armor that Lorenzo is wearing--
you've seen it before. It's studded leather, but

04:07:48.256 --> 04:07:58.178
it's straps and hooks. The theme of it resembles
very much elements of his profession, or at least

04:07:58.178 --> 04:08:06.511
reminding you what he does. So the oil weirdly
does make it strangely erotic. It's your turn, you

04:08:06.511 --> 04:08:10.514
have 25 feet of movement, so that'll only get you
about five squares of movement.

04:08:10.514 --> 04:08:15.407
ASHLY: Okay, I'm going to run. I'm going to run--

04:08:15.407 --> 04:08:16.669
SAM: Away?

04:08:16.669 --> 04:08:17.670
ASHLY: Away.

04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:20.326
SAM: Jesus. Ugh, you're the worst!

04:08:20.326 --> 04:08:22.438
ASHLY: I'm roleplaying!

04:08:22.438 --> 04:08:25.898
MATT: Are you running towards the action or away
from it?

04:08:25.898 --> 04:08:33.863
ASHLY: I'll run towards this-- no, I'm going to
run towards those horses. I'm going to run that way.

04:08:33.863 --> 04:08:37.382
MATT: Make an acrobatics check to leap down.

04:08:37.382 --> 04:08:41.796
ASHLY: Terrible. Awful. Five.

04:08:41.796 --> 04:08:44.742
MATT: Okay, so you lose the last five feet of
movement. That's your movement there.

04:08:44.742 --> 04:08:50.600
ASHLY: My javelin can't go very far, right?

04:08:50.600 --> 04:08:57.816
MATT: Your javelin has a pretty decent range. Does
it have the ranges next to it in the app? That's

04:08:57.816 --> 04:09:04.188
okay, I have it here. The javelin-- it's 30 and
120 feet. So it can go 30 feet without

04:09:04.188 --> 04:09:06.934
disadvantage and 120 feet with disadvantage.

04:09:06.934 --> 04:09:08.946
LIAM: But you said everything's at disadvantage?

04:09:08.946 --> 04:09:10.372
MATT: So you might as well.

04:09:10.372 --> 04:09:14.103
ASHLY: Might as well, yeah. So is Protto within 120
feet?

04:09:14.103 --> 04:09:17.242
MATT: Protto is. Right up there on the hill,
getting his arrows nocked.

04:09:17.242 --> 04:09:26.905
ASHLY: Okay. I hate him definitively, so I'm going
to throw at Protto. With disadvantage. Five.

04:09:26.905 --> 04:09:30.626
MATT: Completely passes over.

04:09:30.626 --> 04:09:37.370
ASHLY: I can use my bonus action to move again? Or
no, I can't.

04:09:37.370 --> 04:09:41.251
MATT: No, you can't. That's where you are. You can
take another javelin attack, because you have

04:09:41.251 --> 04:09:42.299
three javelins.

04:09:42.299 --> 04:09:43.203
ASHLY: I'll try again.

04:09:43.203 --> 04:09:44.536
MATT: You get one more swing at him.

04:09:44.536 --> 04:09:50.211
ASHLY: No. Doesn't work. That's terrible. I won't
even bother.

04:09:50.211 --> 04:09:53.543
MATT: Both javelins miss. You're shaken by this
experience.

04:09:53.543 --> 04:09:58.221
TALIESIN: You did throw two javelins at an
irritating creature, so that's good.

04:09:58.221 --> 04:10:02.390
LIAM: Get the nerves out. Get the nervousness
out.

04:10:02.390 --> 04:10:09.017
MATT: It's now Dwelma's turn. Dwelma is going to
cast Dispel Magic.

04:10:09.017 --> 04:10:12.583
MARISHA: Does that mean I get to take an attack on
her?

04:10:12.583 --> 04:10:15.010
MATT: Not unless you have the War Caster--

04:10:15.010 --> 04:10:15.937
MARISHA: Mage Slayer?

04:10:15.937 --> 04:10:17.005
MATT: Mage Slayer, I mean.

04:10:17.005 --> 04:10:21.247
MARISHA: I almost took that. Took Sentinel
instead.

04:10:21.247 --> 04:10:22.599
TALIESIN: It's going to take two turns though,
right?

04:10:22.599 --> 04:10:23.910
MATT; She wasn't affected by Slow.

04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:25.185
TALIESIN: Ah, really?

04:10:25.185 --> 04:10:29.029
MARISHA: Yeah. She was one of the ones that saved.
That's why I was trying to stun her.

04:10:29.029 --> 04:10:30.680
SAM; What do you cast Dispel Magic on?

04:10:30.680 --> 04:10:33.189
MATT: The magical effect, which is the Slow
effect.

04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:35.003
SAM: And it will do it over all of the--?

04:10:35.003 --> 04:10:39.180
MATT: If it's any spell third level or lower, the
target ends, so Slow fades.

04:10:39.180 --> 04:10:41.152
SAM: Oh no.

04:10:41.152 --> 04:10:46.156
MARISHA: Fuck! That's why I was trying to stun
her! I think she still could have done it, though.

04:10:46.156 --> 04:10:48.997
MATT: Not from being stunned, she couldn't.

04:10:48.997 --> 04:10:51.801
MARISHA; Oh, well, cool. Feels really good about
failing it twice now.

04:10:51.801 --> 04:11:05.880
MATT; Sorry! She's going to move to this side.
Actually, and is going to run. So you both get

04:11:05.880 --> 04:11:07.072
attacks of opportunity on her.

04:11:07.072 --> 04:11:09.186
TALIESIN: You get an attack of opportunity.

04:11:09.186 --> 04:11:13.380
MARISHA: That's not very good at all. 12.

04:11:13.380 --> 04:11:18.949
MATT: 12 is not going to hit! Not with Barkskin,
sorry. Actually, no! She doesn't have Barkskin

04:11:18.949 --> 04:11:23.287
because of the ambush. She hasn't had time to cast
it, so it's an AC of 11. You do hit!

04:11:23.287 --> 04:11:25.488
MARISHA: What? She doesn't move anywhere!

04:11:25.488 --> 04:11:26.954
MATT: She is stuck there.

04:11:26.954 --> 04:11:29.850
TALIESIN: Well actually, no. Can you freeze her?

04:11:29.850 --> 04:11:35.465
MARISHA: She's not moving. She can't move and she
takes five damage.

04:11:35.465 --> 04:11:39.194
TALIESIN: She's still between the two of us. She
couldn't have circled.

04:11:39.194 --> 04:11:45.378
MATT: No, she circled around. It's when she leaves
the range, so she gets stuck there. That ends her

04:11:45.378 --> 04:11:49.438
turn. Now Lorenzo's turn's going to trigger.

04:11:49.438 --> 04:11:56.214
SAM: What the fuck is that?! He's a dragon-man?!
What is this?

04:11:56.214 --> 04:11:57.772
ASHLY: What is happening?

04:11:57.772 --> 04:12:00.011
LIAM: That is huge.

04:12:00.011 --> 04:12:04.468
SAM: Jesus! What the fuck is that?!

04:12:04.468 --> 04:12:06.533
LIAM: I don't know. That's your call.

04:12:06.533 --> 04:12:10.724
MATT: I think it just misses you. It's right
there.

04:12:10.724 --> 04:12:13.047
LIAM: That's why I go far away.

04:12:13.047 --> 04:12:14.110
ASHLY: What the fuck?!

04:12:14.110 --> 04:12:21.371
MATT: As a Cone of Cold bursts forth from--
(whooshing) Lorenzo smiles as his friends have

04:12:21.371 --> 04:12:26.129
come out of the way, and this burst of freezing
cold arcane energy swirls in front of him,

04:12:26.129 --> 04:12:31.247
flash-freezing everything in front, including the
cart, actually.

04:12:31.247 --> 04:12:32.887
ASHLY: So Nott gets frozen too?

04:12:32.887 --> 04:12:40.674
MATT: Nott has to make a reflex save. Beau and
Molly have to make-- sorry, dexterity save. Oh,

04:12:40.674 --> 04:12:41.871
that's a relic!

04:12:41.871 --> 04:12:43.051
MARISHA: Natural 20.

04:12:43.051 --> 04:12:43.841
MATT: Nice!

04:12:43.841 --> 04:12:47.063
SAM: You know what? I'll use my luck.

04:12:47.063 --> 04:12:48.174
TALIESIN: 19.

04:12:48.174 --> 04:12:49.268
MATT: Go for it.

04:12:49.268 --> 04:12:50.387
MARISHA: Yeah, don't get frozen.

04:12:50.387 --> 04:12:51.590
SAM: Terrible!

04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:53.907
MARISHA: Oh no!

04:12:53.907 --> 04:12:54.849
ASHLY: Oh no, what was it?

04:12:54.849 --> 04:12:56.105
SAM: 11.

04:12:56.105 --> 04:13:06.445
MATT: Oh, buddy. All right. Okay. What did you
roll?

04:13:06.445 --> 04:13:07.704
TALIESIN: 19.

04:13:07.704 --> 04:13:13.166
MATT: 19, okay. Nott, you take 41 points of cold
damage.

04:13:13.166 --> 04:13:14.826
SAM: I'll halve that.

04:13:14.826 --> 04:13:16.701
MATT: Okay, so you use your reaction to halve
that.

04:13:16.701 --> 04:13:21.525
ASHLY: Did you say, I'm sorry, 41? Four-one?
Okay.

04:13:21.525 --> 04:13:27.509
MATT: Molly, you take-- that would be 20 points of
cold damage.

04:13:27.509 --> 04:13:28.734
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ.

04:13:28.734 --> 04:13:30.412
MATT: Beau, you take 20 points of cold damage.

04:13:30.412 --> 04:13:31.546
MARISHA: Fuck!

04:13:31.546 --> 04:13:33.605
TALIESIN: 20 points?

04:13:33.605 --> 04:13:46.970
MATT: Yep. As it triggers and the frost finishes
off in the space there, Lorenzo, grinning, looks

04:13:46.970 --> 04:13:52.108
over his shoulder back at Keg and goes like, "Am I
going to have to make a lesson here?"

04:13:52.108 --> 04:13:54.137
SAM: Oh no, he's winning!

04:13:54.137 --> 04:13:56.606
MATT: That brings us to the top of the round.
Nott, you're up.

04:13:56.606 --> 04:14:05.811
SAM: All right, I think I have to use an action to
unlock this cage. To pick the lock.

04:14:05.811 --> 04:14:08.191
MATT: Go for it. Make your lockpick check.

04:14:08.191 --> 04:14:14.306
SAM: Fuck you! Five plus, I don't know. What is it
usually, seven?

04:14:14.306 --> 04:14:15.787
MATT: Dex and proficiency, so it would be seven,
yeah.

04:14:15.787 --> 04:14:16.980
SAM: 12?

04:14:16.980 --> 04:14:22.740
MATT: It's not enough. You spend a moment and the
lock is not going. These are pretty intense cages,

04:14:22.740 --> 04:14:25.237
and you look over there, and Lorenzo's standing
there with the glaive.

04:14:25.237 --> 04:14:33.598
SAM: I'm going to move around the cages or between
them, so that I turn completely invisible.

04:14:33.598 --> 04:14:36.012
MARISHA: That's a good call.

04:14:36.012 --> 04:14:44.852
MATT: You move through a very small gap, they're
pushed up against each other. Make a strength

04:14:44.852 --> 04:14:47.776
check to see if you can push through; you might
not be able to.

04:14:47.776 --> 04:14:50.975
SAM: Nope! That's a three.

04:14:50.975 --> 04:14:54.628
MATT: You can't push through it; the cages are too
close. The small gap there, you try to muscle it,

04:14:54.712 --> 04:14:57.508
but there are two to three people in each cage,
and you can't push though.

04:14:57.508 --> 04:15:06.337
SAM: Can I use my bonus action to-- Jesus, what
can I do for my bonus action? I can't hide. Can I hide?

04:15:06.337 --> 04:15:09.080
MATT: You could try, you're partially obscured.

04:15:09.080 --> 04:15:17.836
SAM: I got nothing else to do on a bonus action.
So yeah, I will try to hide.

04:15:17.836 --> 04:15:20.062
ASHLY: Lorenzo's eyeing him right now, you said?

04:15:20.062 --> 04:15:22.541
SAM: I'll go on the side of the cart and--

04:15:22.541 --> 04:15:24.696
MATT: Lorenzo's eyeing in that direction.

04:15:24.696 --> 04:15:26.994
SAM: I'll hide off the side of the cart.

04:15:26.994 --> 04:15:28.671
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

04:15:28.671 --> 04:15:31.670
SAM: Oh, that's wonderful. It's 29!

04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:38.877
MATT: You appear, within your mind, to have
vanished from the current sight.

04:15:38.877 --> 04:15:40.286
SAM: Of at least Lorenzo.

04:15:40.286 --> 04:15:49.676
MATT: All righty. That brings us to, finishing
Nott, Beau, your turn.

04:15:49.676 --> 04:15:58.603
MARISHA: Oh God! Damn, this fucking druid. I'm
just going to lay into the druid.

04:15:58.603 --> 04:15:59.927
MATT: Go for it.

04:15:59.927 --> 04:16:03.307
MARISHA: Okay, first attack. Natural 20!

04:16:03.307 --> 04:16:04.907
MATT: Oh, snap!

04:16:04.907 --> 04:16:17.393
MARISHA: Thank you, Gil! That's doubling dice
damage. Big money, come on! Six plus four: ten.

04:16:17.393 --> 04:16:21.036
MATT: Ten damage. Oof, Dwelma's looking rough.

04:16:21.036 --> 04:16:22.094
MARISHA: Really?

04:16:22.094 --> 04:16:22.985
MATT: Yeah.

04:16:22.985 --> 04:16:28.006
MARISHA: Second attack. 14 plus seven, so 21.

04:16:28.006 --> 04:16:33.854
MATT: Although technically when the Slow spell
finished, a Hypnotic Pattern may have gone off.

04:16:33.854 --> 04:16:38.982
Yeah, that would have gone off. So make your
wisdom saving throw, if you don't mind.

04:16:38.982 --> 04:16:40.366
LIAM: No, I don't mind at all.

04:16:40.366 --> 04:16:41.791
SAM: May I ask a weird question, Matt?

04:16:41.791 --> 04:16:42.737
MATT: Yes.

04:16:42.737 --> 04:16:46.613
SAM: The guy that I was trying to break out of the
cage: is he alive?

04:16:46.613 --> 04:16:52.593
MATT: Glancing around the area, it looks like the
people that were right on the outer edge of the

04:16:52.593 --> 04:16:55.053
cages are frozen.

04:16:55.053 --> 04:16:59.874
SAM: Would I have seen that before I tried to
unlock the cage?

04:16:59.874 --> 04:17:05.787
MATT: The guy who's near you, he's fine. They
blocked the impact there. It was your latter half

04:17:05.787 --> 04:17:07.349
that was sticking out that got blasted.

04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:09.988
SAM: Okay, cool.

04:17:09.988 --> 04:17:11.603
LIAM: I rolled a 22.

04:17:11.603 --> 04:17:16.724
MATT: 22, all right, so the Hypnotic Pattern does
not affect you. Well done.

04:17:16.724 --> 04:17:19.134
MARISHA: I did 11 damage on my second attack on
her.

04:17:19.134 --> 04:17:20.320
MATT: She goes down.

04:17:20.320 --> 04:17:21.260
MARISHA: Fuck yes!

04:17:21.260 --> 04:17:22.452
SAM: Down like dead?

04:17:22.452 --> 04:17:25.045
MATT: Like unconscious and bleeding out.

04:17:25.045 --> 04:17:28.055
TALIESIN: Do you have any more attacks left?

04:17:28.055 --> 04:17:30.377
MARISHA: I have my bonus. Can I move and then
attack again?

04:17:30.377 --> 04:17:31.544
MATT: Yeah, if you want to.

04:17:31.544 --> 04:17:41.736
TALIESIN: Or you could hit them while they're down
and help them bleed out.

04:17:41.736 --> 04:17:45.759
MARISHA: I thought about that, but I have enough
movement that I can make it to the barbarian, right?

04:17:45.759 --> 04:17:47.456
MATT: You could.

04:17:47.456 --> 04:17:54.346
MARISHA: Are you going to handle Lorenzo? Who's
going to handle Lorenzo? (shouting) Who's going to

04:17:54.346 --> 04:18:02.677
handle Lorenzo? Fuck! I'm going to jump over the
horses' asses and get to Lorenzo.

04:18:02.677 --> 04:18:04.103
MATT: You are.

04:18:04.103 --> 04:18:05.169
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

04:18:05.169 --> 04:18:09.934
MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.

04:18:09.934 --> 04:18:15.222
MARISHA: 14.

04:18:15.222 --> 04:18:21.052
MATT: You get over the horses. Where are you going
to stand, on the cart? There's not a lot of room

04:18:21.052 --> 04:18:22.944
here to stand to fight and you'd have to get
over--

04:18:22.944 --> 04:18:24.664
MARISHA: I have 40 feet of movement, so wherever I
can go.

04:18:24.664 --> 04:18:27.113
MATT: I'll say you can get back right here.

04:18:27.113 --> 04:18:29.374
SAM: Yes, land on the horse's back!

04:18:29.374 --> 04:18:31.524
MARISHA: Can I land on the horse's back?

04:18:31.524 --> 04:18:32.527
MATT: Sure, why not?

04:18:32.527 --> 04:18:34.285
LIAM: Now you're mounted!

04:18:34.285 --> 04:18:35.767
MATT: So you're on the horse.

04:18:35.767 --> 04:18:39.494
MARISHA: I'm on a horse. Am I within range of
him?

04:18:39.494 --> 04:18:40.586
MATT: Yeah.

04:18:40.586 --> 04:18:41.530
LIAM: He's right there.

04:18:41.530 --> 04:18:43.987
MARISHA: I'm in combat range of him.

04:18:44.049 --> 04:18:45.056
MATT: Yes you are.

04:18:45.056 --> 04:18:56.933
MARISHA: I'm going to spend another ki point to do
Patient Defense. I don't trust this motherfucker.

04:18:56.933 --> 04:19:00.087
Hopefully that's useful.

04:19:00.087 --> 04:19:02.394
MATT: That ends your turn?

04:19:02.394 --> 04:19:03.263
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:19:03.263 --> 04:19:14.195
MATT: That brings us to Ruzza. Ruzza, who watched
the druid go down, sees you over there being

04:19:14.195 --> 04:19:26.248
really defensive and looks around. He's going to
attempt to cast Hold Person at level three. I need

04:19:26.248 --> 04:19:29.756
Mollymauk and Beau to make wisdom saving throws
please.

04:19:29.756 --> 04:19:31.056
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.

04:19:31.056 --> 04:19:33.887
SAM: You got this, guys. You got this. Big rolls!

04:19:33.887 --> 04:19:38.213
TALIESIN: 25.

04:19:38.213 --> 04:19:39.419
MARISHA: 21.

04:19:39.419 --> 04:19:42.188
MATT: Completely resists it. Shit.

04:19:42.188 --> 04:19:44.146
LIAM: Burned it! Burn that shit!

04:19:44.146 --> 04:19:53.258
MATT: Back up around the tree trunk there. That
ends her turn. Molly, you're up.

04:19:53.258 --> 04:19:57.413
TALIESIN: There's no way to get through--

04:19:57.413 --> 04:20:00.552
MATT: Thank you for sticking with us. I know this
is going late, but I want to see how this turns

04:20:00.552 --> 04:20:02.866
out. We've been gone for two weeks. Consider it a
bonus episode.

04:20:02.866 --> 04:20:06.719
TALIESIN: There's no way I can make it to Lorenzo
from here, is there?

04:20:06.719 --> 04:20:08.356
MATT: It's possible.

04:20:08.356 --> 04:20:09.596
TALIESIN: Not anymore.

04:20:09.596 --> 04:20:12.823
MATT: You can climb over the cart if you want to.

04:20:12.823 --> 04:20:18.280
TALIESIN: I'm going to get my ass kicked if I get
there. I'm going to try and engage the barbarian

04:20:18.280 --> 04:20:19.813
before raging happens.

04:20:19.813 --> 04:20:23.583
MATT: It's up to you.

04:20:23.583 --> 04:20:30.918
TALIESIN: God damn it. Fuck it, if you're in with
Lorenzo, I'm going for Lorenzo.

04:20:30.918 --> 04:20:34.614
MATT: Okay, make an acrobatics check to try and
get over the cart without issue.

04:20:34.614 --> 04:20:38.286
TALIESIN: Ten.

04:20:38.286 --> 04:20:43.786
MATT: Ten? You lose some movement, but you still
have enough to get right there. That's as close as

04:20:43.786 --> 04:20:45.623
you get. Lorenzo's technically supposed to be in
that space.

04:20:45.623 --> 04:20:53.128
TALIESIN: I'm going to take three attacks. I do
not have advantage, obviously.

04:20:53.128 --> 04:20:54.306
MATT: No, you do not.

04:20:54.306 --> 04:21:00.222
TALIESIN: First attack. Is that cocked or is that
okay?

04:21:00.222 --> 04:21:02.671
SAM: Is it your big dice? It's cocked.

04:21:02.671 --> 04:21:09.385
TALIESIN: Damn it! It was a 20. Now it's a 22.

04:21:09.385 --> 04:21:11.611
ALL: Whoa!

04:21:11.611 --> 04:21:13.383
MATT: Take your damage.

04:21:13.383 --> 04:21:22.289
TALIESIN: That's (counting) 18 points of damage.

04:21:22.289 --> 04:21:23.681
MATT: Nice!

04:21:23.681 --> 04:21:29.892
TALIESIN: Not happy. Swipe number two. That's a
ten.

04:21:29.892 --> 04:21:31.330
MATT: Ten does not hit.

04:21:31.330 --> 04:21:37.556
TALIESIN: Then the other one is a three. That does
not hit either.

04:21:37.556 --> 04:21:43.166
MATT: That first strike carves past. You see blood
spatter across the edge of the hillside. Lorenzo's

04:21:43.166 --> 04:21:54.610
like, "All right, I see what you're doing. One for
one." Slams the glaive onto the ground. That ends

04:21:54.610 --> 04:22:02.572
your turn, Molly. It is Lorenzo's turn. Lorenzo's
going to go ahead and make two glaive attacks

04:22:02.572 --> 04:22:03.722
against you.

04:22:03.722 --> 04:22:05.989
TALIESIN: I think I have a second Blood Maledict
usage now.

04:22:05.989 --> 04:22:08.930
MATT: You're still level five.

04:22:08.930 --> 04:22:13.573
TALIESIN: I know. I was looking, because I know
you changed things, and it says "Blood Maledict:

04:22:13.573 --> 04:22:17.173
"You can invoke a blood curse a number of times per
short rest based on your levels. 2nd one, 5th two,

04:22:17.173 --> 04:22:26.063
"9th three." I'm taking-- hoping this die rolls
worse, come on. For fuck's sake! My Blood Maledict

04:22:26.063 --> 04:22:29.869
literally kills me. Actually, no, fuck, was I
going to do it advanced? I was going to do it

04:22:29.869 --> 04:22:33.445
advanced. My own Blood Maledict knocks me
unconscious.

04:22:33.445 --> 04:22:34.734
MARISHA: You get knocked unconscious?

04:22:34.734 --> 04:22:38.607
TALIESIN: I was at four hit points. What was I
going to do?

04:22:38.607 --> 04:22:40.168
MARISHA: Not that!

04:22:40.168 --> 04:22:42.434
SAM: Oh god, is he still going to attack you?

04:22:42.434 --> 04:22:55.355
MATT: First hit. You guys watch as Molly falls
back unconscious, Lorenzo looks confused. His

04:22:55.355 --> 04:22:59.371
vision still obscured, the blindness.

04:22:59.371 --> 04:23:01.106
MARISHA: Am I flanking Molly?

04:23:01.106 --> 04:23:07.917
MATT: Yeah. Actually, you're not flanking, because
you're at an angle. You're on the horse. So no.

04:23:07.917 --> 04:23:16.324
The first strike slams down into Molly's chest,
the blade actually sinking about seven inches into

04:23:16.324 --> 04:23:23.413
the chest. Blood spatters out of your mouth. You
can use your reaction to make an attack.

04:23:23.413 --> 04:23:25.165
MARISHA: I can, as Sentinel.

04:23:25.165 --> 04:23:26.406
MATT: As Sentinel you can, yes.

04:23:26.406 --> 04:23:27.784
TALIESIN: Thank you.

04:23:27.784 --> 04:23:29.869
MARISHA: 14?

04:23:29.869 --> 04:23:32.608
MATT: 14 does not hit, so it misses there.

04:23:32.608 --> 04:23:34.104
MARISHA: Fuck!

04:23:34.104 --> 04:23:47.163
MATT: Lorenzo looks back over towards Keg. Looks
up at you, Beau, and says, "An example it is."

04:23:47.163 --> 04:23:53.963
Molly, in the brief moments of consciousness, what
do you want to be your last words?

04:23:53.963 --> 04:23:56.278
SAM: Oh no!

04:23:56.278 --> 04:23:57.552
ASHLY: Can I say: Wait!

04:23:57.552 --> 04:23:58.619
MATT: No.

04:23:58.619 --> 04:23:59.835
ASHLY: He's in it? It's done?

04:23:59.835 --> 04:24:01.035
MATT: This is done.

04:24:01.035 --> 04:24:04.096
SAM: Do you get a reaction? Do you have anything?

04:24:04.096 --> 04:24:07.187
ASHLY: Maybe I could talk to him?

04:24:07.187 --> 04:24:13.862
MATT: Molly, you have a brief moment. As the
consciousness and life leaves you, what are your

04:24:13.862 --> 04:24:15.554
last words?

04:24:15.554 --> 04:24:17.589
TALIESIN: (spitting) With blood.

04:24:17.589 --> 04:24:19.237
SAM: Oh, god.

04:24:19.237 --> 04:24:30.674
MATT: As it slams into his face, "Respect," and
then twists the blade. The life leaves Molly.

04:24:30.674 --> 04:24:33.975
TALIESIN: Eyes never shut.

04:24:37.145 --> 04:24:47.027
MATT: It's now Protto's turn. Protto is going to
take a single shot, because he used his action

04:24:47.027 --> 04:24:56.354
surge. Now that he's gotten two javelin tossed,
he's going to fire at you, seeing that you're in

04:24:56.354 --> 04:25:02.624
the proximity. That's a natural two, misses, off
your armor. You're not even paying attention.

04:25:02.624 --> 04:25:07.995
You're looking over at this and you feel it
deflect. No impact. Caleb, your turn.

04:25:07.995 --> 04:25:22.992
LIAM: I'm going to hold my turn, and cast a
Scorching Ray at the sorcerer the moment they do

04:25:22.992 --> 04:25:31.259
anything. First, I will get up off of prone, into
a crouch.

04:25:31.259 --> 04:25:44.414
MATT: Okay. The thugs take their turn. Both of
them are going to--

04:25:44.414 --> 04:25:46.996
TALIESIN: I might need to leave the table for a
while.

04:25:46.996 --> 04:25:49.260
MARISHA: No!

04:25:49.260 --> 04:25:54.252
MATT: They're both going to back up and take two
crossbow shots at Beau. You have your Patient

04:25:54.252 --> 04:25:55.197
Defense on?

04:25:55.197 --> 04:25:56.914
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can't watch this.

04:25:56.914 --> 04:25:58.332
SAM: Oh, god.

04:25:58.332 --> 04:26:01.978
MATT: That is still a 16 and a 17 they rolled.

04:26:01.978 --> 04:26:05.054
MARISHA: 16 misses, 17 hits.

04:26:05.054 --> 04:26:09.619
MATT: That's right! First one, you deflect out of
the air.

04:26:09.619 --> 04:26:10.759
SAM: Catch it.

04:26:10.759 --> 04:26:15.871
MATT: No, she already used her reaction. And the
other one is--

04:26:15.871 --> 04:26:18.498
MARISHA: I can still use Deflect Missiles, right,
to lower it?

04:26:18.498 --> 04:26:25.648
MATT: You use your reaction to do it. But it
rolled a 15 to hit. You, watching this happen,

04:26:25.648 --> 04:26:35.418
hear it deflected off. The other one you catch and
drop, still looking down at Molly's not-moving

04:26:35.418 --> 04:26:46.986
body. As Lorenzo now grins back at you and says,
"Is it time for another, or have you learned your lesson?"

04:26:46.986 --> 04:26:52.940
MARISHA: You should know: I have no respect for
authority.

04:26:52.940 --> 04:26:59.611
MATT: "Then another life it is." All right, that
ends thugs' turn.

04:26:59.611 --> 04:27:08.328
SAM: I'm invisible!

04:27:08.328 --> 04:27:10.816
MATT: He does not see you.

04:27:10.816 --> 04:27:12.698
ASHLY: As a quick reminder!

04:27:12.698 --> 04:27:21.051
MATT: (counting) You're the closest there. The
barbarian goes pulling in, is going to use an

04:27:21.128 --> 04:27:30.615
action to move up into melee with you, but that's
their turn. This is not looking good, guys. Which

04:27:30.615 --> 04:27:44.701
brings us to Keg. Keg, you've seen these
situations before. What are you going to do?

04:27:44.701 --> 04:27:49.214
ASHLY: Can I reach them with my speed?

04:27:49.214 --> 04:27:50.462
MATT: Can you reach who?

04:27:50.462 --> 04:27:54.035
ASHLY: Lorenzo and Beau.

04:27:54.035 --> 04:27:55.148
MATT: No.

04:27:55.148 --> 04:27:58.280
ASHLY: How close can I get?

04:27:58.280 --> 04:28:05.313
MATT: With the tree there, about there is as close
as you can get. You can use your action to move,

04:28:05.313 --> 04:28:06.965
but you wouldn't be able to do anything else.

04:28:06.965 --> 04:28:08.626
ASHLY: But I can talk to him?

04:28:08.626 --> 04:28:16.098
MATT: You can. You move up over the log, and it
gets you there.

04:28:16.098 --> 04:28:34.129
ASHLY: I say: Stop! Stop! Make me the example.
Stop. Just stop attacking them.

04:28:34.129 --> 04:28:39.548
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

04:28:39.548 --> 04:28:43.648
ASHLY: 11.

04:28:43.648 --> 04:28:57.928
MATT: Okay, that's your turn. Dwelma's bleeding
out. Nott, your turn.

04:28:57.928 --> 04:29:03.331
SAM: What do I do? Lorenzo hasn't been hit yet,
has he?

04:29:03.331 --> 04:29:04.991
ASHLY and MATT: He got hit once.

04:29:04.991 --> 04:29:06.973
SAM: Once, but he's not going to go down.

04:29:06.973 --> 04:29:08.982
MARISHA: He's covered in shit.

04:29:08.982 --> 04:29:17.811
MATT: You hear Keg shouting and mid-battle
parleying.

04:29:17.811 --> 04:29:24.430
MARISHA: There's the barbarian on Caleb, which is
not good.

04:29:24.430 --> 04:29:37.231
SAM: I will first try to use a bonus action to use
item and pour acid on one of the locks. See if

04:29:37.231 --> 04:29:39.251
that opens it.

04:29:39.251 --> 04:29:44.375
MATT: Okay. You pour acid on the lock. It's going
to take a moment. Acid isn't an immediate thing,

04:29:44.445 --> 04:29:46.909
if you're not going to splash it on somebody. It
has to eat through metal.

04:29:46.909 --> 04:29:48.728
SAM: Well, shit. Then I won't do that.

04:29:48.728 --> 04:29:50.438
MATT: You would know that as an alchemist.

04:29:50.438 --> 04:29:58.654
SAM: I will-- Shit, what do I do? I can't kill
anything here. I'm going to try the lock. I'm

04:29:58.654 --> 04:30:00.960
going to try the lock. there's nothing else I can
do.

04:30:00.960 --> 04:30:02.151
MATT: All right.

04:30:02.151 --> 04:30:04.451
SAM: It's a natural one.

04:30:04.451 --> 04:30:09.515
MATT: I think the signs are pointing in a
direction. What are you doing, Nott?

04:30:09.515 --> 04:30:19.189
SAM: Yes, so movement and bonus, I will run
towards Caleb, but not directly at the barbarian.

04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:23.257
MARISHA: That's a lot of time.

04:30:23.257 --> 04:30:30.206
MATT: Beau, it's your turn. You see Nott run.

04:30:30.206 --> 04:30:34.717
SAM: Let's see, movement is 30. How far could I
have gotten with just movement?

04:30:34.717 --> 04:30:36.101
MATT: With just your movement?

04:30:36.101 --> 04:30:36.874
SAM: Yeah.

04:30:36.874 --> 04:30:38.566
MATT: Right there.

04:30:38.566 --> 04:30:41.256
SAM: Ah, okay. Yeah, so that's fine.

04:30:41.256 --> 04:30:48.120
MATT: Beau, you see Keg rushing to parley. What do
you do?

04:30:48.120 --> 04:31:01.159
MARISHA: I say: Hey Keg-- no wait, that's your
name-- Hey Lorenzo, this one's for Beau-- no,

04:31:01.159 --> 04:31:06.152
fuck! I'm getting all my names fucked up because
I'm so stressed out! This one's for Molly and

04:31:06.152 --> 04:31:12.009
Yasha, because we failed on this before. I'm going
to get it right this time. I'm going to take my

04:31:12.009 --> 04:31:18.054
tinderbox and light it, and I'm going to-- right
onto him, light him on fire.

04:31:18.054 --> 04:31:19.843
MATT: Okay, he's going to make a dexterity saving
throw.

04:31:19.843 --> 04:31:21.361
MARISHA: I mean, I'm touching him with it.

04:31:21.361 --> 04:31:22.433
MATT: I know. He fails.

04:31:22.433 --> 04:31:23.448
MARISHA: Okay.

04:31:23.448 --> 04:31:28.040
MATT: (flames erupting) Roll a d6 damage. He is on
fire.

04:31:28.040 --> 04:31:32.231
MARISHA: d6 plus what?

04:31:32.231 --> 04:31:34.327
MATT: Just d6 fire damage.

04:31:34.327 --> 04:31:35.392
MARISHA: Four.

04:31:35.392 --> 04:31:42.737
MATT: Four points of fire damage. There's now
flames curling off of his body. He's taking it.

04:31:42.737 --> 04:31:51.046
MARISHA: I take my staff and pure brute anger,
right across his face.

04:31:51.046 --> 04:31:54.786
MATT: Roll for it.

04:31:54.786 --> 04:31:56.560
MARISHA: 12.

04:31:56.560 --> 04:31:57.944
SAM: Get out of there!

04:31:57.944 --> 04:32:02.158
MATT: (whoosh) He's not even looking at you. He's
looking at Keg.

04:32:02.158 --> 04:32:03.258
SAM: Run!

04:32:03.258 --> 04:32:04.399
MATT: She has his attention.

04:32:04.399 --> 04:32:08.045
MARISHA: 18.

04:32:08.045 --> 04:32:09.575
MATT: 18 does hit.

04:32:09.575 --> 04:32:14.218
MARISHA: Six damage.

04:32:14.218 --> 04:32:15.596
MATT: Okay.

04:32:15.596 --> 04:32:17.575
SAM: Run!

04:32:17.575 --> 04:32:31.965
MARISHA: I take my movement and go towards Caleb
and Nott. Fuck.

04:32:31.965 --> 04:32:41.091
MATT: There's a reflex for him to go ahead and
take an attack of opportunity on you with his

04:32:41.091 --> 04:32:50.837
glaive, and then he flickers and looks back to
Keg, seeming more interested in what she has to

04:32:50.837 --> 04:32:56.079
say. That ends your turn?

04:32:56.079 --> 04:32:58.503
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:32:58.503 --> 04:33:04.224
MATT: All right. Ruzza's going to walk up.

04:33:04.224 --> 04:33:07.532
MARISHA: Didn't you have a thing held for the
sorceress?

04:33:07.532 --> 04:33:15.881
LIAM: The moment she does anything. That depends
on how you want to interpret that.

04:33:15.881 --> 04:33:18.798
MATT: The moment she does anything, what were you
going to cast?

04:33:18.798 --> 04:33:21.073
LIAM: Well, I meant do anything-- I guess do
anything to hurt us.

04:33:21.073 --> 04:33:33.984
MATT: Okay. As you're watching her very
carefully-- She's going to do it. She's going to

04:33:33.984 --> 04:33:37.400
step up and cast Cure Wounds.

04:33:37.400 --> 04:33:43.704
SAM: (whispering) Oh, it's a slave. They get a
slave.

04:33:43.704 --> 04:33:45.224
MARISHA: They're going to try and capture Molly?

04:33:45.224 --> 04:33:46.160
SAM: Yeah.

04:33:46.160 --> 04:33:52.390
MATT: Molly's dead. Cure Wounds isn't going to
affect him. She reaches out and touches Lorenzo,

04:33:52.390 --> 04:34:02.262
and he heals up a bit. She starts to try and pat
the flames out a little bit and he shoos her off.

04:34:02.262 --> 04:34:13.432
Now it is Lorenzo's turn, because Molly doesn't
have a turn. Lorenzo's looking at you and says,

04:34:13.432 --> 04:34:22.567
"Looks like we have an eye-for-an-eye scenario."
Points off at Dwelma, who at this point has bled out.

04:34:22.567 --> 04:34:24.255
MARISHA: She's dead?

04:34:24.255 --> 04:34:30.713
MATT: We'll say yes, she's bled out at this point.
"You say you want to be an example, huh?"

04:34:30.713 --> 04:34:33.253
ASHLY: Will you let them go?

04:34:33.253 --> 04:34:40.130
MATT: "Sure." Puts his hand up, flames still
curling up and burning his body, which, roll

04:34:40.130 --> 04:34:41.705
another d6.

04:34:41.705 --> 04:34:44.880
MARISHA: Another four damage.

04:34:44.880 --> 04:34:48.578
SAM: Use your teleport spell!

04:34:48.578 --> 04:34:50.144
ASHLY: I don't have one!

04:34:50.144 --> 04:34:55.564
MATT: Puts his hand up with the glaive in the air,
and you watch as all the other thugs looking off

04:34:55.564 --> 04:35:03.330
pull back their crossbows to the side. The
barbarian in front of you, Caleb, this woman whose

04:35:03.330 --> 04:35:18.091
face is twisted in absolute rage, (panting,
snarling), puts the hammer down. Lorenzo says,

04:35:18.091 --> 04:35:31.461
"We're going to make an example of our old friend.
Round up what you can. You walk with me, Keg," and

04:35:31.461 --> 04:35:43.284
leads you back over to where the rest of you are.
As the warrior steps back, still burning, takes

04:35:43.284 --> 04:35:53.680
and leads you here. They begin to move forward and
push the carts, begin to push the log off of this

04:35:53.680 --> 04:36:02.617
to the side, and the warrior woman grabs the front
of the cart where the horses were and begins to

04:36:02.617 --> 04:36:06.843
drag it forward. As it begins to pull away--

04:36:06.843 --> 04:36:10.039
LIAM: Isn't one of them encased in ice?

04:36:10.039 --> 04:36:20.249
MATT: It's a flash freeze, and then it goes away.
It's not like it keeps it there. As this one pulls

04:36:20.249 --> 04:36:28.820
forward, one of the thugs grabs the body of their
druid and throws it over the top of the cart where

04:36:28.820 --> 04:36:39.084
she seems to vanish, except for a leg dangling out
the side of the illusion. They go forward. Grabs

04:36:39.084 --> 04:36:44.822
your shoulder and pushes you down onto your knees.
Do you do anything?

04:36:44.822 --> 04:36:47.374
ASHLY: No.

04:36:47.374 --> 04:37:01.745
MATT: Looks at the three of you. "The Iron
Shepherds have a reputation, and I expect you to

04:37:01.745 --> 04:37:12.888
"tell everyone you come across what happened here
today, and what a mistake it is to turn against

04:37:12.888 --> 04:37:27.820
"us." Pulls the glaive back slowly and leans into
your ear and says, "That's a bit too quick. I want

04:37:27.820 --> 04:37:38.130
"you to live with the memory of what you did
today," and kicks you in the back and knocks you

04:37:38.130 --> 04:37:51.895
onto your face. Turns around, finally pats out the
flames. "We're moving on! If I see any of your

04:37:51.895 --> 04:38:00.960
"faces again-- (chuckles) Well, at least you'll be
able to see your friend on the other side."

04:38:00.960 --> 04:38:04.039
MARISHA: Fuck you, Lorenzo.

04:38:04.039 --> 04:38:10.435
MATT: "Fuck me, indeed," and he turns and joins
the rest of the caravan as it begins to pull back

04:38:10.435 --> 04:38:19.550
on the path, leaving the four of you beaten,
bruised, and glancing off at the lifeless,

04:38:19.550 --> 04:38:28.717
bloodied body of Mollymauk Tealeaf. And that's
where we're going to leave tonight's episode.

04:38:28.717 --> 04:38:34.963
(exhales)

04:38:34.963 --> 04:38:36.110
ASHLY: Fun guest star.

04:38:36.110 --> 04:38:37.237
SAM: Wow, Ash.

04:38:37.237 --> 04:38:39.054
MATT: Uh, sorry!

04:38:39.054 --> 04:38:44.649
SAM: Good job, Ashly. Welcome to the game.

04:38:44.649 --> 04:38:47.410
LIAM: You have destroyed the show.

04:38:47.410 --> 04:38:52.710
ASHLY: Go ahead and see my way out!

04:38:52.710 --> 04:38:55.784
MATT: No, this is part of the game.

04:38:55.784 --> 04:38:59.804
SAM: No, it wasn't all your fault, just mostly.

04:38:59.804 --> 04:39:04.511
MATT: That was a terrible convergence of events.

04:39:04.511 --> 04:39:05.714
LIAM: Yeah, bad shit happens.

04:39:05.714 --> 04:39:06.799
MATT: It does.

04:39:06.799 --> 04:39:08.858
LIAM: Bad shit happens to mediocre people.

04:39:08.858 --> 04:39:14.884
MATT: Wow. I'm going to sit down.

04:39:14.884 --> 04:39:18.184
SAM: Oh, boy.

04:39:18.184 --> 04:39:26.921
MATT: Well, thank you guys for sticking with us
this long. I know it's been a late night. Our

04:39:26.921 --> 04:39:34.782
return after a week off, and the drama has
certainly kicked in. We'll pick this up next week.

04:39:34.782 --> 04:39:39.916
Let's use this week to love each other.

04:39:39.916 --> 04:39:44.187
MARISHA: Yeah, don't ream us for all the things we
probably did wrong.

04:39:44.187 --> 04:39:50.032
MATT: No, please don't. Everyone here is playing
the game as best they can in the moment, and

04:39:50.032 --> 04:39:53.895
honestly, a lot of it was dice swings and a lot of
it was circumstantial, and this is how the game

04:39:53.895 --> 04:40:02.053
works. It's going to make for a great story, and
will continue to, because you guys have one

04:40:02.053 --> 04:40:13.214
fucking villain now in your campaign. Oh, this is
going to be delicious. Be kind to each other. We

04:40:13.214 --> 04:40:17.559
love you all very much. Let's take a week to
remember Mollymauk.

04:40:17.559 --> 04:40:21.523
MARISHA: There's nothing we can do to bring him
back, is there? There's nothing we got.

04:40:21.523 --> 04:40:22.945
LIAM: Not with what we got.

04:40:22.945 --> 04:40:24.452
MATT: Not with what you got.

04:40:24.452 --> 04:40:28.022
SAM: I've got another vial of acid.

04:40:28.022 --> 04:40:39.069
MATT: On that note, once again, we love you guys.
Have a wonderful week, and is it Thursday yet?

04:40:39.069 --> 04:40:41.291
Good night.

04:40:51.372 --> 04:53:35.342

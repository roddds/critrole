00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:01.661
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:01.661 --> 00:00:02.782
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:02.782 --> 00:00:04.090
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.873
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:09.890
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.935
LAURA: Thank you, Liam.

7
00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:11.768
MATT: Wow.

8
00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:14.468
So---
MARISHA: There are so

9
00:00:14.468 --> 00:00:15.301
many puns.

10
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:16.134
MATT: Oh yeah.

11
00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:18.343
We've returned from our Gen Con live show last week,

12
00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:20.818
which went amazingly

13
00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:22.698
and since we are back in our home front

14
00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:23.531
here at the table,

15
00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:24.772
let's go ahead and jump into some announcements

16
00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:27.367
before the show, beginning with our fantastic sponsor,

17
00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.468
our friends in Campaign 2 since the beginning,

18
00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:32.196
D&amp;D Beyond.
TRAVIS: D&amp;D Beyond!

19
00:00:32.196 --> 00:00:34.505
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, they wanted me to let you guys know

20
00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:36.646
that a few of our cast members participated in

21
00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:39.135
a series called "Fandom Uncovered,"

22
00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:41.618
which explores a variety of amazing and intense fandoms,

23
00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:42.561
like this one.

24
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.406
The most recent episode is about D&amp;D,

25
00:00:44.406 --> 00:00:48.655
and you can find it at fandom.link/dnd.

26
00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:51.227
Now, you guys might've caught the end

27
00:00:51.227 --> 00:00:55.164
of the D&amp;D Beyond presidential campaign last week,

28
00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:59.031
where Liam and myself were elected

29
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:02.543
co-presidents of D&amp;D Beyond.

30
00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:03.376
TRAVIS: Oh!

31
00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:06.859
SAM: And we have held that title--

32
00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.191
well, we held that title.

33
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:12.526
Something happened and maybe we should

34
00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:14.130
tell you guys what happened

35
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.614
or maybe it's just better to just show them what happened.

36
00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:19.084
MARISHA: Oh yeah.
LAURA: I thought this was done.

37
00:01:19.084 --> 00:01:21.341
SAM: It is done. It is done,

38
00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:23.633
but we have to show the people how it really ended.

39
00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:24.912
LIAM: Turn back the clock.

40
00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:26.969
SAM: So this video will start right after

41
00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.285
last week's show stopped.

42
00:01:30.285 --> 00:01:31.652
Roll it.

43
00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:34.138
BRIAN: I'm being told that the election results are in.

44
00:01:34.138 --> 00:01:35.062
[cheering]

45
00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:38.605
The winner-- stop celebrating early.

46
00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:41.982
The winner, everyone in the world,

47
00:01:41.982 --> 00:01:43.939
is Mr. Liam O'Brien!

48
00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.264
[cheering]

49
00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:48.774
LIAM: Critters...

50
00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:52.024
[cheering]

51
00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:55.695
You are the wind beneath my dead wings.

52
00:01:55.695 --> 00:01:58.784
I could not be here today without my goblin,

53
00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.431
Sam, my beautiful husband,

54
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:03.547
I would like to propose a partnership.

55
00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:08.505
From here on out, we will president as one.

56
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.253
Will you make me the happiest president

57
00:02:13.253 --> 00:02:15.197
of D&amp;D Beyond on Earth?

58
00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:20.197
[cheering]

59
00:02:20.197 --> 00:02:23.455
[cheering]

60
00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:28.362
SAM: Liam, I've never lost anything in my life,

61
00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:33.086
and by accepting this, I keep that streak going.

62
00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.120
[cheering]

63
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.858
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!

64
00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:40.191
I will be your co-president!

65
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.314
SAM: Woo, we did it!

66
00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:44.741
Wow!

67
00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:46.931
Wow! What a great show!

68
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:48.572
What a great ending to the show!

69
00:02:48.572 --> 00:02:49.756
TRAVIS: Hey, congrats guys!

70
00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:51.290
SAM: Get out of the way.
LIAM: Out of the way, wiener dog.

71
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.843
SAM: Ow, yes!

72
00:02:52.843 --> 00:02:54.907
Yes, what a show!

73
00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.176
What a finish to the show!

74
00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.388
You won, but then I won, too, and we won together!

75
00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:03.098
We're co-presidents of D&amp;D Beyond, yes!

76
00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:03.931
Thank you.

77
00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:06.756
Thank you for bringing me along for the ride, man.

78
00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:08.569
LIAM: We are stronger together.

79
00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.598
SAM: Yeah, we are.

80
00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:11.574
LIAM: D&amp;D Beyond isn't going to know what them.

81
00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:12.407
SAM: No, no.

82
00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:15.022
What do we do first?

83
00:03:15.022 --> 00:03:15.951
What do we do?

84
00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:16.951
LIAM: Oh, bubby.

85
00:03:18.183 --> 00:03:19.862
We celebrate.

86
00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:24.787
(electronic dance music)

87
00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.671
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

88
00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:33.460
I love money!

89
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.360
(electronic dance music)

90
00:04:57.733 --> 00:05:00.387
(birds chirping)

91
00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:02.865
(laughing and whooping)

92
00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:05.745
SAM: I did not think you could fit that your nose,

93
00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:08.004
but you did! Whoa!

94
00:05:08.004 --> 00:05:09.860
LIAM: You doubt me, Sam Riegel?

95
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.797
SAM: Wow.

96
00:05:10.797 --> 00:05:12.362
Wow, I mean, that's a tough--

97
00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:13.906
LIAM: Ah! Our day has come.

98
00:05:13.906 --> 00:05:15.115
ADAM: You idiots.

99
00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:15.948
SAM: Hey, Adam--

100
00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:17.224
ADAM: What are you doing?

101
00:05:17.224 --> 00:05:19.332
LIAM: We are the presidents of D&amp;D Beyond.

102
00:05:19.332 --> 00:05:20.973
SAM: Yeah, <i>dos presidentes</i>.

103
00:05:20.973 --> 00:05:24.126
ADAM: Presidents of the party planning committee.

104
00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:26.338
We've been through this so many times.

105
00:05:26.338 --> 00:05:29.602
But you're not anymore because you're both fired.

106
00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:30.560
SAM: Fired?

107
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.098
LIAM: We have so much work to do!

108
00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:32.931
SAM: Yeah!

109
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:34.197
ADAM: Considering that you just blew

110
00:05:34.197 --> 00:05:36.520
the entire year's party planning budget,

111
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.162
no, you don't have anything else to do.

112
00:05:39.162 --> 00:05:39.995
It's over.

113
00:05:41.823 --> 00:05:45.382
I'm going to need you to pay the overages on this bill,

114
00:05:45.382 --> 00:05:48.932
especially this 1984 Chianti.

115
00:05:51.096 --> 00:05:54.229
I am so disappointed in you.

116
00:05:56.325 --> 00:05:57.633
(melancholy music)

117
00:05:57.633 --> 00:06:00.032
LIAM: Holy crap.

118
00:06:00.032 --> 00:06:01.757
SAM: What? Let me see the...

119
00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:02.590
Ooh.

120
00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:05.723
Hold on, I can't.

121
00:06:05.723 --> 00:06:07.055
LIAM: You like wine too much.

122
00:06:07.055 --> 00:06:09.794
SAM: Wow, that's a lot.

123
00:06:09.794 --> 00:06:11.290
Oh, man.

124
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.957
He seemed really sad or mad or I can't tell.

125
00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:19.562
LIAM: We had it all, Sam.

126
00:06:19.562 --> 00:06:21.414
SAM: We had it.

127
00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:23.113
But then we blew it.

128
00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:27.160
Here, you take this.

129
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.978
You got more votes, so you should pay for it.

130
00:06:30.978 --> 00:06:32.621
LIAM: That's fair.

131
00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:33.924
Come here.

132
00:06:33.924 --> 00:06:34.757
Come here.

133
00:06:34.757 --> 00:06:37.272
SAM: Can we still be the presidents of I don't know,

134
00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.380
each other?

135
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.875
LIAM: You'll always be my number one, Mr. President.

136
00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:44.701
SAM: That means a lot, man.

137
00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:45.873
That means a lot.

138
00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:50.389
(melancholy music)

139
00:07:00.483 --> 00:07:03.508
SAM: And that's the end of our presidential reign,

140
00:07:03.508 --> 00:07:06.966
unfortunately. We were presidents for about 90 minutes.

141
00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:09.612
LIAM: We flew too close to the sun.

142
00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:11.920
TRAVIS: I feel like leaving on Sunday early

143
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.377
or Saturday was a mistake.

144
00:07:13.377 --> 00:07:14.210
LAURA: Yeah.

145
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.043
TRAVIS: We missed out.

146
00:07:15.043 --> 00:07:15.876
MARISHA: No, you made the right call.

147
00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:19.180
SAM: Thank you again to D&amp;D Beyond for allowing us

148
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.426
to go on this journey and we learned a lot

149
00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:25.984
and we'll never make those mistakes again.

150
00:07:25.984 --> 00:07:27.458
LAURA: You'll never be allowed to.

151
00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:29.822
SAM: That's true. That is absolutely true.

152
00:07:29.822 --> 00:07:30.655
MATT: Legally.

153
00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:31.656
(laughter)

154
00:07:31.656 --> 00:07:32.726
MATT: We have it in writing.

155
00:07:32.726 --> 00:07:34.176
(laughter)

156
00:07:34.176 --> 00:07:35.852
MATT: Thank you Sam, and thank you, D&amp;D Beyond,

157
00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:38.305
a fantastic resource for D&amp;D players

158
00:07:38.305 --> 00:07:40.244
and Dungeon Masters out there

159
00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:42.739
that allows you to create characters and run campaigns

160
00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:43.716
with a new encounter builder

161
00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:45.818
that they've been having in Alpha that's awesome.

162
00:07:45.818 --> 00:07:47.227
Check it out.

163
00:07:47.227 --> 00:07:51.074
SAM: That whole fucking campaign.
(laughter)

164
00:07:51.074 --> 00:07:52.301
TRAVIS: Didn't fucking shave.

165
00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:53.657
LAURA: You guys.

166
00:07:53.657 --> 00:07:55.323
TALIESIN: Oh, god.
SAM: What? It was--

167
00:07:55.323 --> 00:07:56.304
LAURA: Worth it!

168
00:07:56.304 --> 00:07:57.325
LIAM: It was worth it.

169
00:07:57.325 --> 00:07:59.415
SAM: That party was off the hook!

170
00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:01.015
(laughter)

171
00:08:01.015 --> 00:08:02.641
MARISHA: It was really awesome.

172
00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:04.371
TRAVIS: Erika Ishii and the one-arm pushups.

173
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:05.221
MARISHA: Yeah!

174
00:08:05.221 --> 00:08:06.415
MATT: She doesn't fuck around.

175
00:08:06.415 --> 00:08:07.248
TRAVIS: Shit.

176
00:08:07.248 --> 00:08:09.853
MATT: Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

177
00:08:09.853 --> 00:08:12.539
All right, so once again,

178
00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:13.576
thank you, everyone, for coming to the live show,

179
00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:14.417
watching our live show,

180
00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:15.953
and if you haven't already seen it yet,

181
00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:17.524
you're going to be really confused about tonight's episode

182
00:08:17.524 --> 00:08:19.284
and you should watch it.

183
00:08:19.284 --> 00:08:21.419
We did announce that we're headed to Austin--

184
00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:22.252
LAURA: Yay!

185
00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.410

Where we get to follow Taryon Darrington and the Brigade

189
00:08:34.145 --> 00:08:36.987
after the adventures of Vox Machina.

190
00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:39.810
It's going to have the rest of the cast

191
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.893
playing members of the Brigade.

00:08:41.893 --> 00:08:44.291

Tuesday, August 13, at 9:00 AM--

196
00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:51.683
I got a bubble in my throat.

197
00:08:51.683 --> 00:08:53.248
Don't give me that face, Laura Bailey.

198
00:08:53.248 --> 00:08:54.529
It happens.

199
00:08:54.529 --> 00:08:55.950
We are imperfect creatures!

200
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.775
(laughter)

201
00:08:59.775 --> 00:09:03.465

It's a great talk.

209
00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:20.719
MARISHA: And she just had a music video drop today.

210
00:09:20.719 --> 00:09:22.958
MATT: Yeah, yeah, "Drowning in the Sound."

Check it out if you have the chance.

212
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.621
I believe that's all the announcements,

213
00:09:27.621 --> 00:09:29.681
so without further ado,

214
00:09:29.681 --> 00:09:30.643

(dragon roaring)

253
00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:14.753
MATT: And welcome back.

254
00:11:14.753 --> 00:11:16.286
LAURA: (laughs)

255
00:11:16.286 --> 00:11:20.351
You guys are getting lazy. (laughs)

256
00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:24.808
So last we left off,

257
00:11:24.808 --> 00:11:26.947
The Mighty Nein had found their way

258
00:11:26.947 --> 00:11:29.893
to the northern realm of the Greying Wildlands

259
00:11:29.893 --> 00:11:33.598
in search of answers regarding Caduceus' visions

260
00:11:33.598 --> 00:11:37.148
he's been granted multiple times through the Wildmother

261
00:11:37.148 --> 00:11:40.793
and the pursuit of fixing the broken halves

262
00:11:40.793 --> 00:11:43.486
of this blade of which you have discovered

263
00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:48.486
has some ancient power attached to its historical lineage.

264
00:11:48.643 --> 00:11:52.409
You made your way across the mountains of the Flotket Alps

265
00:11:52.409 --> 00:11:56.461
into the subterranean dwarven-elven city of Uthodurn

266
00:11:56.461 --> 00:11:59.478
where you acquired a room to stay

267
00:11:59.478 --> 00:12:02.609
and then made your way to the forge

268
00:12:02.609 --> 00:12:05.549
of the one individual responsible for

269
00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:07.233
previously reinforcing this blade,

270
00:12:07.233 --> 00:12:10.679
a very talented blacksmith.

271
00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:12.652
Legendary, if you will.

272
00:12:12.652 --> 00:12:14.009
However, upon arriving there,

273
00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:16.373
discovered that he had passed away four years previous

274
00:12:16.373 --> 00:12:17.848
and instead were met with his son,

275
00:12:17.848 --> 00:12:19.946
who was an apprentice of his

276
00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:23.426
and is hoping to eventually climb to

277
00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:26.283
that level of notoriety and skill.

278
00:12:26.283 --> 00:12:29.339
A brief discussion between him and you

279
00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:32.058
unveiled that this weapon requires a certain material

280
00:12:32.058 --> 00:12:35.800
to be recreated called iceflex,

281
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.474
which is a form of mithral that has to be enchanted,

282
00:12:39.474 --> 00:12:43.700
essentially, by the breath of a white dragon.

283
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.599
Not knowing where one might be found,

284
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:51.599
you stepped out into the alley on the side of the smithy

285
00:12:52.026 --> 00:12:54.309
to where a hooded, cloaked figure

286
00:12:54.309 --> 00:12:57.152
approached you from the shadows,

287
00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:59.036
and that's where we're going to go ahead and pick up.

288
00:12:59.036 --> 00:12:59.869
TRAVIS: Jesus.

289
00:13:00.886 --> 00:13:03.551
MATT: As you all, mid-discussion, glance over,

290
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:05.742
Caduceus noticing first, Jester quickly second,

291
00:13:05.742 --> 00:13:08.579
and the rest of you, this figure approaching.

292
00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:11.010
If I could have the player please come to the table.

293
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.501
Mica Burton is joining us as our guest.

294
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:15.458
SAM: This is a quick join.

295
00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:17.144
MARISHA: Yeah, it is.

296
00:13:17.144 --> 00:13:17.977
MATT: I was not going to have

297
00:13:17.977 --> 00:13:20.381
another Noelle Stevenson happen.

298
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:21.889
LIAM: Fastest ever, maybe.

299
00:13:22.725 --> 00:13:24.342
MATT: Welcome, Mica!
MICA: Thank you!

300
00:13:24.342 --> 00:13:25.258
MATT: Glad you could join us.

301
00:13:25.258 --> 00:13:28.055
TRAVIS: (clapping) Aw, yeah!

302
00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:30.957
SAM: Do you need me to recap you on the D&amp;D Beyond campaign?

303
00:13:30.957 --> 00:13:32.266
MICA: Uh, no.

304
00:13:32.266 --> 00:13:33.315
SAM: Or should we just get into it?

305
00:13:33.315 --> 00:13:35.322
MICA: I saw your codpiece and that's all I needed,

306
00:13:35.322 --> 00:13:37.425
so I'm all caught up.

307
00:13:37.425 --> 00:13:38.258
LAURA: I'm sorry.

308
00:13:38.258 --> 00:13:40.259
MICA: Yeah, thank you.
MATT: I'm so sorry.

309
00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:42.050
MATT: If you'd like to describe

310
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.165
what they see as you approach.

311
00:13:44.165 --> 00:13:44.998
MICA: Yes!

312
00:13:44.998 --> 00:13:46.434
(dice clattering)

313
00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:47.556
SAM: Oh!
MATT: Yes!

314
00:13:47.556 --> 00:13:51.287
SAM: Laura Bailey has a run for her money!

315
00:13:51.287 --> 00:13:52.535
TRAVIS: Oh no.
TALIESIN: That's a lot.

316
00:13:52.535 --> 00:13:54.593
LAURA: And they're beautiful!

317
00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:55.640
MICA: Thank you!

318
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.190
SAM: How will you roll any of them?

319
00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.023
MICA: This is my special one.

320
00:13:58.023 --> 00:13:58.856
LAURA: (gasps)

321
00:13:58.856 --> 00:13:59.849
MICA: Okay, now I'm done.

322
00:13:59.849 --> 00:14:00.707
MATT: (laughs) She came prepared.

323
00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:01.961
MICA: I came prepared.

324
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:03.061
This one says fuck on the one.
LAURA: I don't want to touch

325
00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:04.561
them. Can I touch them?

326
00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:05.504
MICA: Yeah, you can touch them.

327
00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:07.221
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

328
00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.741
TRAVIS: Dice protocol is very important.

329
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:10.290
LIAM: Well, we'll see you next week, ladies and gentlemen.

330
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.524
(laughter)

331
00:14:11.524 --> 00:14:13.989
TALIESIN: Been a great show.

332
00:14:13.989 --> 00:14:16.455
MICA: Right, so you see before you

333
00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:20.838
a warm brown-skinned aasimar,

334
00:14:22.064 --> 00:14:26.261
halo above her head, white cloak, white dress,

335
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:29.262
thigh-high brown boots, gold freckles all over her skin,

336
00:14:29.262 --> 00:14:30.718
and bright gold eyes.

337
00:14:30.718 --> 00:14:34.507
She has a scimitar and a wand stuck in her brown belt

338
00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:38.547
and she has long long long white blonde hair

339
00:14:38.547 --> 00:14:42.501
down to her waist up in a super-high ponytail on her head.

340
00:14:42.501 --> 00:14:43.827
TRAVIS: Fucking dope.
LAURA: Aw shit!

341
00:14:43.827 --> 00:14:45.494
TRAVIS: A halo?
MICA: A halo.

342
00:14:45.494 --> 00:14:47.707
MATT: A faint glowing halo just above the head.

343
00:14:47.707 --> 00:14:51.550
SAM: Is there any physical resemblance to Yasha,

344
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.166
not like facial resemblance,

345
00:14:55.166 --> 00:14:57.266
but is it the same body type?

346
00:14:57.266 --> 00:14:58.724
TRAVIS: Stature-wise?
MATT: No.

347
00:14:58.724 --> 00:14:59.557
TRAVIS: Whoa.

348
00:15:00.627 --> 00:15:03.409
Uh, wings?

349
00:15:03.409 --> 00:15:04.242
MICA: No wings.

350
00:15:04.242 --> 00:15:05.508
TRAVIS: No wings.
MICA: Just a halo.

351
00:15:05.508 --> 00:15:06.483
TRAVIS: And a cloak.

352
00:15:06.483 --> 00:15:07.574
Like a cloak with a hood?

353
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.032
MICA: A white cloak with a hood and a gold trim

354
00:15:10.032 --> 00:15:11.566
and it matches the gold trim on her dress.

355
00:15:11.566 --> 00:15:12.956
LAURA: Is your hood up or down right now?

356
00:15:12.956 --> 00:15:13.870
MICA: My hood is down right now.

357
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.866
TRAVIS: Brown-skinned, gold, golden eyes, and freckles?

358
00:15:16.866 --> 00:15:18.187
MICA: Golden freckles all over her body.

359
00:15:18.187 --> 00:15:19.937
SAM: Golden freckles, that is so cool.

360
00:15:19.937 --> 00:15:21.588
LAURA: That's so fucking cool.

361
00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:24.251
SAM: I mean: Oh, who's this?

362
00:15:24.251 --> 00:15:26.501
(laughter)

363
00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:30.536
MARISHA: I think we've died.

364
00:15:30.536 --> 00:15:31.871
We died, right?

365
00:15:31.871 --> 00:15:35.071
SAM: Fjord, draw your-- nope.

366
00:15:36.194 --> 00:15:38.507
LAURA: She's beautiful.

367
00:15:38.507 --> 00:15:41.409
MICA: I'm just here to make sure that everything's fine,

368
00:15:41.409 --> 00:15:44.810
but I see that you've met Umi.

369
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.435
TRAVIS: Umi?
LAURA and SAM: Umagorn?

370
00:15:47.435 --> 00:15:48.386
MICA: You've met Umi.

371
00:15:48.386 --> 00:15:51.612
LAURA: Yes? Is that the guy in there that we talked to?

372
00:15:51.612 --> 00:15:53.353
MICA: Yeah, and I couldn't help but overhearing

373
00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:55.436
something about a dragon.

374
00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:56.269
LAURA: (gasps)

375
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:58.556
MICA: I couldn't help but overhearing

376
00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:01.647
something about going to find this dragon.

377
00:16:01.647 --> 00:16:03.643
MARISHA: Wait wait wait wait wait.

378
00:16:03.643 --> 00:16:05.070
His nickname's Umi?

379
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.903
MICA: Yeah!

380
00:16:05.903 --> 00:16:06.736
MARISHA: (laughs)

381
00:16:06.736 --> 00:16:08.204
TALIESIN: I'm glad I wasn't the only one.

382
00:16:08.204 --> 00:16:09.914
LAURA: You were listening to our entire--

383
00:16:09.914 --> 00:16:11.546
SAM: Are you a spy?

384
00:16:11.546 --> 00:16:13.380
MICA: I just...

385
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.889
I was eavesdropping just a little bit.

386
00:16:14.889 --> 00:16:17.238
I'm sorry. I'm not sorry. I'm...

387
00:16:17.238 --> 00:16:18.838
TRAVIS: You heard the whole conversation, then,

388
00:16:18.838 --> 00:16:20.071
or just the end?

389
00:16:20.071 --> 00:16:21.648
MICA: The whole conversation.

390
00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.314
TRAVIS: Fair enough.
MARISHA: What's your name?

391
00:16:23.314 --> 00:16:24.588
SAM: Were you invisible?

392
00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:25.841
MICA: My name is Reani.

393
00:16:25.841 --> 00:16:27.327
TRAVIS: Reani.

394
00:16:27.327 --> 00:16:29.512
MICA: I just wanted to make sure that he was safe.

395
00:16:29.512 --> 00:16:30.877
I just want to make sure you guys aren't bad.

396
00:16:30.877 --> 00:16:34.129
And you guys don't seem bad, you just seem...

397
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:36.037
LAURA: Awesome and colorful.

398
00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.559
MICA: Like you need help.

399
00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:39.405
TALIESIN: That, too, is very fair.

400
00:16:39.405 --> 00:16:41.238
MARISHA: Are we that transparent?

401
00:16:41.238 --> 00:16:42.544
MICA: Kind of.

402
00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:43.759
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.

403
00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:45.389
LIAM: You and Umagorn are--

404
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:47.374
MICA: Umi.

405
00:16:47.374 --> 00:16:50.500
LIAM: Yes, are friends or family or?

406
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.396
MICA: He's my friend.

407
00:16:51.396 --> 00:16:52.229
LIAM: Okay.

408
00:16:52.229 --> 00:16:53.062
LAURA: How long have you known him?

409
00:16:53.062 --> 00:16:54.142
MICA: For about four years.

410
00:16:54.142 --> 00:16:54.975
LAURA: That's cool.
MICA: Yeah.

411
00:16:54.975 --> 00:16:56.172
SAM: Are you guys together?

412
00:16:56.172 --> 00:16:57.841
MICA: No.
SAM: Oh.

413
00:16:57.841 --> 00:16:58.674
Because he's--

414
00:16:58.674 --> 00:17:00.825
MICA: But I like to bake him things--

415
00:17:00.825 --> 00:17:01.658
LAURA: (gasps)

416
00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:03.553
MICA: -- and I like to make him things.

417
00:17:03.553 --> 00:17:06.892
He's my friend and we like to,

418
00:17:06.892 --> 00:17:09.072
sometimes we tell each other secrets

419
00:17:09.072 --> 00:17:13.655
and sometimes we like to plant flowers together

420
00:17:13.655 --> 00:17:16.814
and sometimes, even though he grumbles about it,

421
00:17:16.814 --> 00:17:19.037
he lets me leave him little presents in his forge,

422
00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:20.096
I don't know if you saw them,

423
00:17:20.096 --> 00:17:22.256
if you saw the flowers on the wall, that was me.

424
00:17:22.256 --> 00:17:24.155
SAM: We did, but that guy?

425
00:17:24.155 --> 00:17:26.439
MATT: "Don't listen to a single word she's saying!"

426
00:17:26.439 --> 00:17:28.845
MICA: Umi, be quiet, you know you love me!

427
00:17:28.845 --> 00:17:30.336
LAURA: Umi, you love it!

428
00:17:30.336 --> 00:17:31.573
MATT: You see his arms splayed out

429
00:17:31.573 --> 00:17:32.755
on both sides of the doorframe,

430
00:17:32.755 --> 00:17:36.235
his face wet with sweat and bright red

431
00:17:36.235 --> 00:17:38.377
and he's just like,

432
00:17:38.377 --> 00:17:42.065
"Would you please be so kind as to maybe, you know,

433
00:17:42.065 --> 00:17:46.095
"not just go rambling about things to strangers?"

434
00:17:46.095 --> 00:17:49.685
MARISHA: Hey Umi, you be proud of your sleepovers.

435
00:17:49.685 --> 00:17:50.794
All right?

436
00:17:50.794 --> 00:17:53.474
There's nothing to be ashamed.

437
00:17:53.474 --> 00:17:54.551
LAURA: Of.

438
00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:56.364
(laughter)

439
00:17:56.364 --> 00:17:58.484
SAM: It's like we finish each other's sentences.

440
00:17:58.484 --> 00:18:00.150
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

441
00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:06.421
MATT: "Look, what you're looking for, it's not easy.

442
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:07.773
"Sure you could use some help.

443
00:18:07.773 --> 00:18:10.374
"Go for it, but just, you know,

444
00:18:10.374 --> 00:18:12.607
"friends keep certain things between friends."

445
00:18:12.607 --> 00:18:16.523
MICA: So you don't want me to bring you back a souvenir?

446
00:18:16.523 --> 00:18:20.050
MATT: "I mean, yes, a souvenir'd be great, I'd love that."

447
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:20.883
MICA: That's what I thought.

448
00:18:20.883 --> 00:18:22.974
MATT: "And just ask-- it's too late now.

449
00:18:22.974 --> 00:18:23.807
"There, fine.

450
00:18:23.807 --> 00:18:27.101
"Anyway, good luck, stay alive, I'll be here."

451
00:18:27.101 --> 00:18:28.144
LAURA: You bake things?

452
00:18:28.144 --> 00:18:28.977
MICA: I do.

453
00:18:28.977 --> 00:18:29.992
LAURA: What kind of things?

454
00:18:29.992 --> 00:18:30.825
MICA: I like cakes.

455
00:18:30.825 --> 00:18:32.602
Umi likes my cakes, right, Umi?

456
00:18:32.602 --> 00:18:33.435
LAURA: Yeah, you do!

457
00:18:33.435 --> 00:18:36.439
MATT: "They're tasty, I'll give you that."
MICA: Thank you.

458
00:18:36.439 --> 00:18:37.321
Umi likes my cakes.

459
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:38.506
LAURA: Do you want a cupcake?

460
00:18:38.506 --> 00:18:39.339
MICA: You have cupcakes?

461
00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:41.017
LAURA: Oh, do I have cupcakes!

462
00:18:41.017 --> 00:18:41.850
MICA: Can I have a cupcake?

463
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.884
LAURA: Yes, and you can choose your flavor, though!

464
00:18:43.884 --> 00:18:44.809
MICA: I can choose my flavor?

465
00:18:44.809 --> 00:18:45.987
LAURA: I've got to see how many I have left,

466
00:18:45.987 --> 00:18:48.265
hold on, let me look at my thingie.

467
00:18:48.265 --> 00:18:49.540
TALIESIN: You actually wrote that down,

468
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.873
how many cupcakes you have.
LAURA: Fuck yes I did.

469
00:18:51.873 --> 00:18:54.891
MATT: ♪ Keeping tabs on your inventory! ♪

470
00:18:54.891 --> 00:18:58.684
LAURA: Other possessions. I have four cupcakes left!

471
00:18:58.684 --> 00:19:00.149
SAM: And they're fresh!

472
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:02.247
LAURA: They are fresh, I just got them.

473
00:19:02.247 --> 00:19:04.453
MICA: Do you have a vanilla?

474
00:19:04.453 --> 00:19:05.995
LAURA: Let me look.

475
00:19:05.995 --> 00:19:07.133
SAM: Ooh, I think they were blueberry.

476
00:19:07.133 --> 00:19:09.573
LAURA: There was blueberry, but she did put a couple,

477
00:19:09.573 --> 00:19:12.523
there's one black moss flavor left.

478
00:19:12.523 --> 00:19:14.049
Have you had a black moss cupcake?

479
00:19:14.049 --> 00:19:15.064
MICA: Never.

480
00:19:15.064 --> 00:19:15.897
LAURA: You've got to try it.

481
00:19:15.897 --> 00:19:16.730
MICA: Well, then I'll try it!

482
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.839
LAURA: Okay, here you go.

483
00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:21.213
It's like the opposite of vanilla, but it's so good!

484
00:19:21.213 --> 00:19:22.858
It kind of tastes like matcha.

485
00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:24.093
MICA: (gasps)

486
00:19:24.093 --> 00:19:24.926
LAURA: I know!

487
00:19:24.926 --> 00:19:26.036
MICA: I just shove it in my face.

488
00:19:26.036 --> 00:19:29.295
TRAVIS: Jester, I hate to interrupt the cupcake bonanza,

489
00:19:29.295 --> 00:19:30.505
but we are supposed to be--

490
00:19:30.505 --> 00:19:31.424
MARISHA: (blows raspberry)

491
00:19:31.424 --> 00:19:33.140
LAURA: Don't get a little frosting on your cloak,

492
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.483
because it's so pristine.

493
00:19:34.483 --> 00:19:35.316
MICA: Thank you, I won't.

494
00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:36.328
SAM: Is it good, do you like it?

495
00:19:36.328 --> 00:19:37.161
MICA: It's so good!

496
00:19:37.161 --> 00:19:39.034
SAM: Insight check.

497
00:19:39.034 --> 00:19:42.181
MATT: Roll!
(laughter)

498
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.014
SAM: Five.

499
00:19:44.446 --> 00:19:46.892
MATT: She's hard to read, Nott.

500
00:19:46.892 --> 00:19:48.850
She got a tough exterior.

501
00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:52.550
She seems to be enjoying the cupcake, but who knows?

502
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.813
LAURA: What were you saying, Fjord?

503
00:19:53.813 --> 00:19:55.509
LIAM: Yeah, we have a to-do list.

504
00:19:55.509 --> 00:19:57.671
Are we going to stand in the street or what are we doing?

505
00:19:57.671 --> 00:19:59.570
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go somewhere.

506
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.888
Do you want to go with a bunch of strangers

507
00:20:01.888 --> 00:20:05.537
back to a hotel room?

508
00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.607
MICA: I don't see what could be wrong with that.

509
00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:10.257
MARISHA: Awesome, she's great.

510
00:20:10.257 --> 00:20:14.341
MATT: "You'll be fine, they're curious."

511
00:20:14.341 --> 00:20:15.918
MICA: I'll make sure they don't die!

512
00:20:15.918 --> 00:20:17.228
MATT: "And I'll have one of those."

513
00:20:17.228 --> 00:20:20.845
LAURA: Oh, I've only got-- okay.

514
00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:22.962
We got to stop back by this bakery, you guys.

515
00:20:22.962 --> 00:20:26.380
SAM: We know where it is, it'll be fine.

516
00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.707
Reani?

517
00:20:27.707 --> 00:20:28.540
MICA: Yes.

518
00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.594
SAM: Are we going to walk and talk?

519
00:20:29.594 --> 00:20:31.510
MICA: Yes! Let's walk and talk!

520
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.515
MARISHA: I look around, make sure no one's listening.

521
00:20:33.515 --> 00:20:34.348
SAM: What do you do?

522
00:20:34.348 --> 00:20:38.633
How do you know, are you a blacksmith like Umi? Uni?

523
00:20:38.633 --> 00:20:39.667
MICA: Umi.
SAM: Umi.

524
00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:40.922
MICA: No, I'm not a blacksmith,

525
00:20:40.922 --> 00:20:44.462
I kind of keep this place safe.

526
00:20:44.462 --> 00:20:45.796
TRAVIS: This place, Uthodurn?

527
00:20:45.796 --> 00:20:46.915
MICA: Yeah!

528
00:20:46.915 --> 00:20:49.748
SAM: From invaders, are you in the military?

529
00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:53.324
MICA: No, well, there's a lot of bad people here and--

530
00:20:53.324 --> 00:20:54.157
LAURA: Here?

531
00:20:54.157 --> 00:20:56.170
MICA: Yeah, there's a lot of underground crime.

532
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.794
You wouldn't think it, but,

533
00:20:58.794 --> 00:21:00.116
well, now they're not that much around

534
00:21:00.116 --> 00:21:01.565
because I like to take care of them.

535
00:21:01.565 --> 00:21:03.699
I like to wander and help people, you know?

536
00:21:03.699 --> 00:21:06.925
I found Umagorn and he was,

537
00:21:06.925 --> 00:21:10.242
he took me in when I accidentally--

538
00:21:10.242 --> 00:21:11.916
it's a long story.

539
00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:13.139
MARISHA: You're a vigilante?

540
00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:13.972
MICA: Kind of.

541
00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:14.971
How about you guys come over to my house

542
00:21:14.971 --> 00:21:16.921
and I'll make you guys tea and then we can talk.

543
00:21:16.921 --> 00:21:17.873
TRAVIS: You have a house?
SAM: Tea?

544
00:21:17.873 --> 00:21:19.016
TALIESIN: You have tea?

545
00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:19.849
MICA: I have tea!

546
00:21:19.849 --> 00:21:20.682
Do you like tea?
MARISHA: You have a house?

547
00:21:20.682 --> 00:21:22.036
MICA: Yeah!

548
00:21:22.036 --> 00:21:25.136
LAURA: I feel like you're our dream come true.

549
00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:28.200
MICA: No, I'm just me.

550
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.266
SAM: She likes tea, she likes baked goods,

551
00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:33.576
do you also like whiskey?

552
00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:34.676
MICA: Who doesn't?

553
00:21:34.676 --> 00:21:35.923
SAM: I love this person.

554
00:21:35.923 --> 00:21:38.711
(laughter)

555
00:21:38.711 --> 00:21:41.238
MICA: I have wine if that's more your style.

556
00:21:41.238 --> 00:21:42.786
MARISHA: Who do you work for?

557
00:21:42.786 --> 00:21:43.619
Who sent you?

558
00:21:43.619 --> 00:21:44.452
MICA: Myself.

559
00:21:45.449 --> 00:21:48.531
MARISHA: You said you know about
secret underground organizations?

560
00:21:48.531 --> 00:21:50.737
MICA: Because I fight them.

561
00:21:50.737 --> 00:21:54.778
MARISHA: Have you... are you playing both parties right now?

562
00:21:54.778 --> 00:21:55.611
Are you a spy?
MICA: No.

563
00:21:55.611 --> 00:21:57.779
MARISHA: Are you a double agent?
MICA: No.

564
00:21:57.779 --> 00:22:01.573
TRAVIS: You've said you've known Umi for about four years.

565
00:22:01.573 --> 00:22:03.740
Have you been in this city longer than that?

566
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.260
MICA: I've been here for about five years.

567
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.426
TRAVIS: About five years. What were you doing before that?

568
00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:10.584
MICA: Well, before that I was wandering around

569
00:22:10.584 --> 00:22:12.845
saving other people, and before that,

570
00:22:12.845 --> 00:22:17.220
I was dropped off by my mom

571
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.369
in Nicodranas,

572
00:22:18.369 --> 00:22:21.799
and before that, I don't know, I was born, I guess.

573
00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:23.367
LIAM: What is--

574
00:22:23.367 --> 00:22:24.282
SAM: Nicodranas?

575
00:22:24.282 --> 00:22:26.889
Jessie's from Nicodranas!

576
00:22:26.889 --> 00:22:28.226
MICA: What, no way!

577
00:22:28.226 --> 00:22:30.667
LAURA: You're from Nicodranas, too.

578
00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:31.718
MICA: We're going to be friends.

579
00:22:31.718 --> 00:22:33.352
SAM: Are you guys called Nicodranians?

580
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:34.609
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

581
00:22:34.609 --> 00:22:35.596
Nicodranians.

582
00:22:35.596 --> 00:22:36.543
SAM: Nicodranians.

583
00:22:36.543 --> 00:22:37.578
LAURA: Yeah.

584
00:22:37.578 --> 00:22:38.986
LIAM: They're from the Drans.

585
00:22:38.986 --> 00:22:41.163
MICA: I'm sorry, were you asking about...

586
00:22:41.163 --> 00:22:43.514
TRAVIS: I was a little bit curious,

587
00:22:43.514 --> 00:22:46.514
I've never seen a--

588
00:22:46.514 --> 00:22:47.464
what is that?

589
00:22:47.464 --> 00:22:49.786
MICA: Well, Landon told me that it means that

590
00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:52.376
I'm part angel or celestial or something,

591
00:22:52.376 --> 00:22:54.231
but I don't know, some really nice angel

592
00:22:54.231 --> 00:22:55.868
talks to me from time to time in my dreams

593
00:22:55.868 --> 00:22:58.784
and tells me what to do, so I'm just going to trust it.

594
00:22:58.784 --> 00:23:01.228
SAM: Landon is the name of your angel?

595
00:23:01.228 --> 00:23:02.961
MICA: No, Landon's like my dad.

596
00:23:02.961 --> 00:23:03.794
LAURA: Like your dad?

597
00:23:03.794 --> 00:23:06.268
MICA: He's kind of my dad, I don't know my dad.

598
00:23:06.268 --> 00:23:08.961
MARISHA: You have daddy issues too?
LAURA: I don't know my dad either!

599
00:23:08.961 --> 00:23:10.336
MARISHA: Damn it!

600
00:23:12.069 --> 00:23:13.851
She's too perfect.

601
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:16.004
SAM: That's four out of six.

602
00:23:16.004 --> 00:23:17.167
LAURA: Do you like fire?

603
00:23:17.167 --> 00:23:20.562
Do you shove balls into your stomach?

604
00:23:20.562 --> 00:23:22.574
MICA: I don't shove anything into anywhere.

605
00:23:22.574 --> 00:23:23.407
LAURA: That's okay.

606
00:23:23.407 --> 00:23:25.640
MARISHA: Is that your actual accent?

607
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.451
Do you have another accent that you're hiding?

608
00:23:27.451 --> 00:23:29.061
MICA: No?

609
00:23:29.061 --> 00:23:31.359
LIAM: I feel like we are losing focus.

610
00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:33.193
MARISHA: You're right.

611
00:23:33.193 --> 00:23:37.394
LIAM: We have to find a dragon and deal with it.

612
00:23:37.394 --> 00:23:41.341
I don't understand why you want to accompany us on that.

613
00:23:41.341 --> 00:23:42.940
MICA: Well, it's funny you mention that,

614
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.408
because remember the whole angel thing

615
00:23:44.408 --> 00:23:45.793
that I was telling you about?

616
00:23:45.793 --> 00:23:47.283
LIAM: Yeah, just 20 seconds ago.

617
00:23:47.283 --> 00:23:48.949
MICA: He's been telling me about a white dragon.

618
00:23:48.949 --> 00:23:51.306
Then I heard you guys talking about a white dragon,

619
00:23:51.306 --> 00:23:53.533
so I feel like I have to go with you, right?

620
00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:55.654
SAM: Your angel's been talking about a white dragon?

621
00:23:55.654 --> 00:23:56.595
MICA: Yeah, in my dreams.

622
00:23:56.595 --> 00:23:58.207
I get dreams sometimes that tells me what to do

623
00:23:58.207 --> 00:23:59.223
so I follow it.

624
00:23:59.223 --> 00:24:00.403
SAM: What's this angel's--

625
00:24:00.403 --> 00:24:02.136
MARISHA: It is you, too!

626
00:24:02.975 --> 00:24:04.182
SAM: Look, it's five out of six!

627
00:24:04.182 --> 00:24:05.157
(shouting)

628
00:24:05.157 --> 00:24:06.331
MICA: I'm so confused, what's happening?

629
00:24:06.331 --> 00:24:09.573
SAM: You are perfect.

630
00:24:11.297 --> 00:24:13.129
But wait.

631
00:24:13.129 --> 00:24:14.320
LAURA: Have you ever been in jail?

632
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.284
Have you ever pretended to be someone else?

633
00:24:16.284 --> 00:24:17.137
SAM: Do you like to burn things?

634
00:24:17.137 --> 00:24:18.778
MICA: No, no, sometimes.

635
00:24:18.778 --> 00:24:20.469
SAM: Oh!

636
00:24:20.469 --> 00:24:22.206
MARISHA: She's like a horoscope.

637
00:24:22.206 --> 00:24:23.661
LIAM: Who doesn't like to burn things from time to time?

638
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:24.752
TRAVIS: Do you like cats?
SAM: Me!

639
00:24:24.752 --> 00:24:25.931
MICA: I love cats!

640
00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:26.764
TALIESIN: There, you've got six out of six.

641
00:24:26.764 --> 00:24:27.831
TRAVIS: Do you like books?

642
00:24:27.831 --> 00:24:29.759
MICA: Eh.
SAM: Oh.

643
00:24:30.853 --> 00:24:31.812
LIAM: Down the drain.

644
00:24:31.812 --> 00:24:34.400
(whistles)

645
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.787
SAM: What is your angel?

646
00:24:36.787 --> 00:24:38.737
LAURA: Is he dressed in a green cloak?
MICA: No.

647
00:24:38.737 --> 00:24:40.361
LAURA: Is he named the Traveler?
MICA: No.

648
00:24:40.361 --> 00:24:43.903
My angel's name is Samliel, and he likes to talk to me

649
00:24:43.903 --> 00:24:47.337
and he came to me when I was really little

650
00:24:47.337 --> 00:24:49.693
and he tells me to go help people

651
00:24:49.693 --> 00:24:51.990
and he told me to come here

652
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.962
and so I've been here for five years

653
00:24:53.962 --> 00:24:56.311
and he hasn't really talked to me since,

654
00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:57.144
for a few years now,

655
00:24:57.144 --> 00:24:59.149
but then he started telling me about this dragon

656
00:24:59.149 --> 00:25:00.587
and then you guys said dragon,

657
00:25:00.587 --> 00:25:02.468
and so I feel like I should be here, right?

658
00:25:02.468 --> 00:25:04.889
TRAVIS: Yeah no, you definitely should.

659
00:25:04.889 --> 00:25:06.742
TALIESIN: I think we all need to sit down with a cup of tea.

660
00:25:06.742 --> 00:25:07.876
LAURA: We're your destiny!

661
00:25:07.876 --> 00:25:10.059
TRAVIS: You're part angel or celestial

662
00:25:10.059 --> 00:25:11.888
but you have an angel that speaks to you,

663
00:25:11.888 --> 00:25:14.247
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to play catch-up.

664
00:25:14.247 --> 00:25:15.080
MICA: Yeah.

665
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.529
LAURA: Oh, that would've been amazing.
MARISHA: Did you get it?

666
00:25:16.529 --> 00:25:18.674
LAURA: No.
MARISHA: Oh, so close.

667
00:25:18.674 --> 00:25:21.023
MATT: Damn, that would've been cool.

668
00:25:21.023 --> 00:25:24.075
TRAVIS: Yes, your house, how far is that from here

669
00:25:24.075 --> 00:25:26.226
and who is, who lives at your house?

670
00:25:26.226 --> 00:25:27.276
MICA: Oh, it's just me.

671
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:29.881
TRAVIS: You have your own house after five years?

672
00:25:29.881 --> 00:25:31.730
MICA: Well, I've been traveling--

673
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.351
SAM: You don't know what the real estate market is here.

674
00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:35.293
LAURA: Plus, we have our own house

675
00:25:35.293 --> 00:25:37.820
after like two days in Xhorhas.

676
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.478
SAM: It's true.
TRAVIS: Yes, but we came by it

677
00:25:39.478 --> 00:25:41.450
under very questionable circumstances.

678
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.505
LAURA: Oh, no, she made the--

679
00:25:42.505 --> 00:25:47.292
have you ever carried a dodecahedron across enemy lines?

680
00:25:47.292 --> 00:25:48.125
MICA: No.

681
00:25:49.078 --> 00:25:54.078
TRAVIS: Jester, maybe not with all of our stuff.

682
00:25:54.445 --> 00:25:55.904
LAURA: Sorry, Fjord.

683
00:25:55.904 --> 00:25:57.315
SAM: Are we close to your home?

684
00:25:57.315 --> 00:25:58.577
MICA: We are, it's on the Liber Disk

685
00:25:58.577 --> 00:25:59.910
so we're just going to walk a little bit further

686
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.458
and we're going to get to my house

687
00:26:01.458 --> 00:26:03.665
and if you want tea, I have tea,

688
00:26:03.665 --> 00:26:05.158
if you have wine, I have wine,

689
00:26:05.158 --> 00:26:06.211
I can also bake cookies,

690
00:26:06.211 --> 00:26:07.951
TRAVIS: She's going to kill us all.

691
00:26:07.951 --> 00:26:08.997
MICA: Does anybody want cookies?

692
00:26:08.997 --> 00:26:11.055
LAURA: I would love them!

693
00:26:11.055 --> 00:26:11.888
TALIESIN: That's very exciting.

694
00:26:11.888 --> 00:26:13.528
MICA: All right, well then follow me!

695
00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:15.478
MARISHA: I'm still not redacting

696
00:26:15.478 --> 00:26:18.272
my theory that we might be dead.

697
00:26:18.272 --> 00:26:19.772
LAURA: I'm following behind her very

698
00:26:19.772 --> 00:26:22.622
enthusiastically.
TALIESIN: This is precisely what we've needed.

699
00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:24.698
MATT: Traveling through the neighborhood,

700
00:26:24.698 --> 00:26:27.156
you guys still generally stick out like a sore thumb

701
00:26:27.156 --> 00:26:30.431
amongst the general populace of Uthodurn, you know.

702
00:26:30.431 --> 00:26:32.816
A few eyes turn curiously as you walk by,

703
00:26:32.816 --> 00:26:37.168
some seem just confounded, some seem untrusting,

704
00:26:37.168 --> 00:26:40.065
some seem dubious.

705
00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:42.719
LIAM: Do people react to her?

706
00:26:42.719 --> 00:26:46.882
MATT: It's hard to tell, you're moving as a cluster.

707
00:26:46.882 --> 00:26:49.801
Nobody seems to cause any sort of stir

708
00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:50.939
for a being that walks around

709
00:26:50.939 --> 00:26:53.339
with a faint halo visible half the time.

710
00:26:53.339 --> 00:26:54.382
TRAVIS: Yeah.

711
00:26:54.382 --> 00:26:56.457
MATT: Nobody seems to be having any sort of adverse reaction

712
00:26:56.457 --> 00:26:58.302
or calling additional attention to it.

713
00:26:58.302 --> 00:27:01.970
Probably as if they have seen it a number of times.

714
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.099
TRAVIS: As we're walking, can we just keep an eye out

715
00:27:04.099 --> 00:27:06.930
for anyone else that has glowing circles above their heads?

716
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.222
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

717
00:27:08.222 --> 00:27:10.139
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's try this.

718
00:27:11.012 --> 00:27:12.240
20.

719
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.458
MATT: Nice.

720
00:27:13.458 --> 00:27:15.729
Currently the only one.

721
00:27:15.729 --> 00:27:19.117
TRAVIS: There's your class, roll amazing.

722
00:27:19.117 --> 00:27:20.867
Okay, only one, good.

723
00:27:21.747 --> 00:27:23.533
Those were shit before.

724
00:27:23.533 --> 00:27:26.204
MARISHA: What's your class? Roll amazing.

725
00:27:26.204 --> 00:27:29.365
MATT: Hey, man, at least there's balance somewhere.

726
00:27:29.365 --> 00:27:30.664
As you move along for a few minutes,

727
00:27:30.664 --> 00:27:35.516
gauging this unexpected conversation

728
00:27:35.516 --> 00:27:39.599
and companion, you turn to see

729
00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:42.273
the domicile of Reani,

730
00:27:42.273 --> 00:27:44.641
if would you like to describe the home that they encounter?

731
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:48.894
MICA: It's a small home, mostly elven details,

732
00:27:48.894 --> 00:27:52.826
only one story, but once you enter, it goes far back

733
00:27:52.826 --> 00:27:55.990
so it's like a studio apartment,

734
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.265
so it's kitchen, then living room, and then two small doors,

735
00:27:59.265 --> 00:28:01.182
so bedroom and bathroom.

736
00:28:01.182 --> 00:28:02.574
MATT: It's like the shotgun houses of New Orleans.

737
00:28:02.574 --> 00:28:03.504
MICA: Exactly, yeah, yeah.

738
00:28:03.504 --> 00:28:04.610
TALIESIN: One of those train car---

739
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.794
MICA: Yeah, like a train car. Train car apartment. Yeah.

740
00:28:07.794 --> 00:28:09.482
It's filled with little knickknacks and books,

741
00:28:09.482 --> 00:28:12.042
definitely from places that aren't from around here,

742
00:28:12.042 --> 00:28:13.342
they look like they're from all over,

743
00:28:13.342 --> 00:28:18.342
like little keepsakes, lots of plants

744
00:28:18.745 --> 00:28:21.437
and a little dog bed in the corner.

745
00:28:21.437 --> 00:28:22.966
(gasps)

746
00:28:22.966 --> 00:28:25.324
TRAVIS: You have so many plants.

747
00:28:25.324 --> 00:28:28.190
That's unusual, there's no sunlight, yes?

748
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.482
SAM: We're underground, aren't we?

749
00:28:29.482 --> 00:28:32.498
MICA: Well, I can keep them looking nice and I love plants.

750
00:28:32.498 --> 00:28:34.584
TRAVIS: How do you do that?

751
00:28:34.584 --> 00:28:35.874
MICA: Well, once when I was a kid,

752
00:28:35.874 --> 00:28:37.828
and Landon told me to go get herbs,

753
00:28:37.828 --> 00:28:40.847
because he likes herbs, he's like an alchemist,

754
00:28:40.847 --> 00:28:41.781
and I was his apprentice

755
00:28:41.781 --> 00:28:43.201
and that's where my mom dropped me off,

756
00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:44.807
still haven't met her though, that sucks,

757
00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:48.953
but I ran into these fey and they gave me powers

758
00:28:48.953 --> 00:28:51.786
and now I can do cool druid stuff.

759
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.371
TRAVIS: Right, yes.

760
00:28:54.371 --> 00:28:56.454
SAM: See, Fjord, you just meet someone

761
00:28:56.454 --> 00:28:58.222
and they give you powers.

762
00:28:58.222 --> 00:28:59.681
MICA: Yeah!

763
00:28:59.681 --> 00:29:01.419
TRAVIS: Right. Good, good.

764
00:29:01.419 --> 00:29:03.087
MICA: Do you need a fairy or something,

765
00:29:03.087 --> 00:29:05.649
is that what's happening?

766
00:29:05.649 --> 00:29:06.991
LAURA: Do you need a fairy, Fjord?

767
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:08.276
TRAVIS: Not currently.

768
00:29:08.276 --> 00:29:09.819
LIAM: Well--

769
00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:11.610
MARISHA: Can you like rent them or something?

770
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.168
MICA: I don't know.
MARISHA: For like training?

771
00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:14.770
MICA: If we go to a forest, I'm sure I could find one.

772
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.863
LIAM: Dragon, bringing it back to the dragon.

773
00:29:16.863 --> 00:29:19.063
MICA: Oh right, the dragon, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

774
00:29:19.063 --> 00:29:20.220
LAURA: As this conversation is going on,

775
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.135
I'm going to wander around and look at all your knickknacks.

776
00:29:22.135 --> 00:29:25.836
TALIESIN: It's like someone dropped an ADD bomb.

777
00:29:25.836 --> 00:29:27.350
MATT: Pretty much.

778
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.911
TRAVIS: I'm very interested in hearing what Samliel--

779
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:30.744
MICA: Samliel.

780
00:29:30.744 --> 00:29:32.736
TRAVIS: Has been telling you about a dragon.

781
00:29:32.736 --> 00:29:34.104
MICA: Only that there is one.

782
00:29:34.104 --> 00:29:35.132
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

783
00:29:35.132 --> 00:29:37.236
SAM: Give you any can he or they give you any details

784
00:29:37.236 --> 00:29:39.971
about where or--
MICA: Nope!

785
00:29:39.971 --> 00:29:42.716
SAM: Well, can you ask?

786
00:29:42.716 --> 00:29:44.198
MICA: That's not how that works.

787
00:29:44.198 --> 00:29:46.701
LIAM: Any specific type of breed?

788
00:29:46.701 --> 00:29:47.546
MICA: A white dragon.

789
00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:48.533
LIAM: White dragon.

790
00:29:48.533 --> 00:29:50.142
SAM: So he just came to you in a dream and said,

791
00:29:50.142 --> 00:29:51.464
"There is a white dragon?"

792
00:29:51.464 --> 00:29:52.581
MICA: Mm-hmm.

793
00:29:52.581 --> 00:29:53.414
SAM: Wake up!

794
00:29:53.414 --> 00:29:54.247
MICA: Mm-hmm!

795
00:29:54.247 --> 00:29:57.631
TRAVIS: How often do you communicate with your angel?

796
00:29:57.631 --> 00:29:59.890
MICA: Well, he's been telling me about a white dragon

797
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.984
every night for the past two weeks,

798
00:30:01.984 --> 00:30:05.464
and last night I didn't get anything,

799
00:30:05.464 --> 00:30:07.273
and today I met you!

800
00:30:07.273 --> 00:30:09.095
So I'm guessing that's going to be it for a while.

801
00:30:09.095 --> 00:30:11.327
LAURA: So he just pops in and goes, "White dragon,"

802
00:30:11.327 --> 00:30:12.160
and then goes away.

803
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.160
MICA: Mm-hmm, or "Bad guys," or sometimes, "Big quest,"

804
00:30:17.167 --> 00:30:20.245
or sometimes, "There's a war you have to stop!"

805
00:30:20.245 --> 00:30:21.299
Or, you know, stuff like that.

806
00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:23.037
SAM: Is there a war that you have to stop?

807
00:30:23.037 --> 00:30:23.870
MICA: Not right now.

808
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:24.703
SAM: Oh.

809
00:30:24.703 --> 00:30:26.810
MARISHA: How old are you?
MICA: 33.

810
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:27.643
LAURA: 33.

811
00:30:27.643 --> 00:30:30.211
MARISHA: I feel so under-accomplished.

812
00:30:30.211 --> 00:30:31.123
LAURA: She's done a lot.

813
00:30:31.123 --> 00:30:33.161
TALIESIN: How long has it been since we messed up

814
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:37.025
underneath the ground with the King Who Crawls?

815
00:30:37.025 --> 00:30:41.691
MATT: Oh, it's probably been

816
00:30:41.691 --> 00:30:42.533
a few days.

817
00:30:42.533 --> 00:30:43.637
TALIESIN: Okay, just a few days.

818
00:30:43.637 --> 00:30:45.374
MATT: I'd say close to a week.

819
00:30:45.374 --> 00:30:46.918
You guys have taken a few evenings to recover

820
00:30:46.918 --> 00:30:50.010
or for transitions to Nicodranas, so about a week.

821
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:50.958
TALIESIN: That's- no, this is good.

822
00:30:50.958 --> 00:30:52.320
This is good, this is good.

823
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.807
LAURA: I'm going to leave a little figurine of the Traveler

824
00:30:55.807 --> 00:30:59.425
that I have made amongst the rest of her knickknacks.

825
00:30:59.425 --> 00:31:00.397
MATT: Okay.

826
00:31:00.397 --> 00:31:02.127
Like, quietly?

827
00:31:02.127 --> 00:31:04.502
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

828
00:31:07.452 --> 00:31:08.285
LAURA: Ooh.

829
00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:12.240
26.

830
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.319
MATT: Cleverly, expertly placed

831
00:31:14.319 --> 00:31:16.735
as you just wander past one of the shelves

832
00:31:16.735 --> 00:31:19.475
and without even a moving or twitch of the arm,

833
00:31:19.475 --> 00:31:23.901
suddenly, something is there that previously wasn't.

834
00:31:23.901 --> 00:31:26.438
LIAM: Bringing the conversation back to our dragon,

835
00:31:26.438 --> 00:31:28.932
which could possibly be her dragon,

836
00:31:28.932 --> 00:31:31.607
is this, are we doing this now,

837
00:31:31.607 --> 00:31:35.455
we are set out in the morning to find this thing or--

838
00:31:35.455 --> 00:31:37.506
SAM: What time is it?

839
00:31:37.506 --> 00:31:40.139
MATT: At this point in time, you would know

840
00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:42.973
it's pushing close to noon.

841
00:31:42.973 --> 00:31:45.711
Probably about 11:00 in the morning.

842
00:31:45.711 --> 00:31:47.143
LIAM: It's 11:52.

843
00:31:47.143 --> 00:31:48.706
TALIESIN: Then figure out where we're going

844
00:31:48.706 --> 00:31:50.205
and head out in the morning.

845
00:31:50.205 --> 00:31:51.891
SAM: Well, don't we need materials first?

846
00:31:51.891 --> 00:31:54.200
We need the sword, right?

847
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.352
LAURA: We have the sword.

848
00:31:55.352 --> 00:31:57.676
LIAM: Caleb does, but Liam doesn't remember,

849
00:31:57.676 --> 00:31:59.751
did they give us directions to where this thing is

850
00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:00.960
or it's just out in the wild?

851
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.890
MATT: You have, nobody knows.

852
00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.909
Or at least that you've encountered.

853
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:08.763
You're given a couple possibilities,

854
00:32:08.763 --> 00:32:11.353
you were mentioned that there was the Vellum Steeple,

855
00:32:11.353 --> 00:32:13.858
which is an archive,

856
00:32:13.858 --> 00:32:16.238
might be a good place to go for information.

857
00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:17.815
You were told of the Plexus Post,

858
00:32:17.815 --> 00:32:22.637
which is an odd trading post run by an individual named Ava,

859
00:32:22.637 --> 00:32:26.249
and those are the only real clues you have at the moment,

860
00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:29.230
the rest is up to you guys to try and figure out.

861
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:33.312
SAM: The items that we needed, we needed the sword--

862
00:32:33.312 --> 00:32:34.393
MATT: You have the sword pieces.

863
00:32:34.393 --> 00:32:35.226
LAURA: We need some mithral.

864
00:32:35.226 --> 00:32:36.951
MATT: You need some mithral to take with you

865
00:32:36.951 --> 00:32:39.750
to be enchanted and whatever else you guys are looking for

866
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.706
as far as like--

867
00:32:40.706 --> 00:32:41.844
TALIESIN: And then the refined residuum.

868
00:32:41.844 --> 00:32:42.942
MATT: Refined residuum, if that's something

869
00:32:42.942 --> 00:32:44.115
you're looking for as well.

870
00:32:44.115 --> 00:32:47.186
TRAVIS: Mithral is what we need to have for iceflex.

871
00:32:47.186 --> 00:32:48.800
Like, the breath on the mithral.

872
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.300
LAURA: Yes.

873
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.290
MARISHA: I mean, I imagine we could go try and talk to Ava,

874
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:54.602
see if she has any?

875
00:32:54.602 --> 00:32:56.007
MICA: (pained) Oh.

876
00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:58.651
SAM: What's that, you have a stomachache?

877
00:32:58.651 --> 00:33:00.794
MICA: No, she's mean.

878
00:33:00.794 --> 00:33:02.650
LAURA: Ava?
TRAVIS: Who's mean?

879
00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:04.914
MICA: Ava.
LAURA: Ava Endlewood.

880
00:33:04.914 --> 00:33:07.818
LIAM: Mean like she would hit us, or--

881
00:33:07.818 --> 00:33:08.891
MICA: No, mean like she doesn't like

882
00:33:08.891 --> 00:33:11.924
my flower crowns when I give them to her.

883
00:33:11.924 --> 00:33:14.317
TRAVIS: Flower crowns?

884
00:33:14.317 --> 00:33:16.226
MICA: Do you want one?

885
00:33:16.226 --> 00:33:18.751
LAURA: Do you want one?

886
00:33:18.751 --> 00:33:20.184
MICA: Before he even answers I immediately start

887
00:33:20.184 --> 00:33:21.933
Druidcrafting little flowers

888
00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:24.237
and start weaving them together super fast

889
00:33:24.237 --> 00:33:28.144
and I just place the flower crown on his head.

890
00:33:28.144 --> 00:33:30.869
TRAVIS: I feel... ♪ pretty! ♪

891
00:33:30.869 --> 00:33:33.038
(laughter)

892
00:33:33.038 --> 00:33:34.057
TALIESIN: It suits you.

893
00:33:34.057 --> 00:33:35.167
TRAVIS: Thank you.

894
00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:36.709
MICA: See, he likes it.

895
00:33:36.709 --> 00:33:38.526
She doesn't.

896
00:33:38.526 --> 00:33:40.495
LAURA: She's obviously got problems.

897
00:33:40.495 --> 00:33:42.945
SAM: Well, we're quite likable,

898
00:33:42.945 --> 00:33:44.570
so maybe we can turn the tide

899
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.755
and go speak with her and get her--

900
00:33:47.755 --> 00:33:50.696
MICA: You can try!
SAM: To like us, maybe?

901
00:33:50.696 --> 00:33:51.849
MICA: Yeah!

902
00:33:51.849 --> 00:33:53.827
SAM: Do you know where she, she has this Plexus Post?

903
00:33:53.827 --> 00:33:54.819
LAURA: She's at the Plexus Post.

904
00:33:54.819 --> 00:33:55.652
MICA: She is, yeah.

905
00:33:55.652 --> 00:33:56.557
SAM: Do you know where that is?

906
00:33:56.557 --> 00:33:59.585
MICA: I do, but can we go there after wine?

907
00:33:59.585 --> 00:34:01.199
SAM: Sure.

908
00:34:01.199 --> 00:34:02.421
I thought, yeah?

909
00:34:02.421 --> 00:34:04.028
MICA: Wine and tea first, yeah?

910
00:34:04.028 --> 00:34:05.972
TALIESIN: Wine and tea for the moment, sure.

911
00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:06.805
MICA: Yeah!

912
00:34:09.052 --> 00:34:10.196
I immediately start bustling around the kitchen

913
00:34:10.196 --> 00:34:13.953
and making tea and pouring glasses of wine for everyone.

914
00:34:13.953 --> 00:34:16.336
MARISHA: Okay, so this Master Ava,

915
00:34:16.336 --> 00:34:21.336
maybe she requires a certain disposition.

916
00:34:21.472 --> 00:34:23.522
Maybe--

917
00:34:23.522 --> 00:34:24.938
SAM: She doesn't like frilly things.

918
00:34:24.938 --> 00:34:26.225
LIAM: Maybe she just doesn't want party favors

919
00:34:26.225 --> 00:34:28.407
placed on top of her head.

920
00:34:28.407 --> 00:34:30.965
MARISHA: Maybe you should talk to her.

921
00:34:30.965 --> 00:34:33.315
LIAM: I'm going to the archive, so...

922
00:34:33.315 --> 00:34:34.283
SAM: Oh!

923
00:34:34.283 --> 00:34:36.789
MARISHA: I would like to join you at the archives

924
00:34:36.789 --> 00:34:38.834
but you could also,

925
00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:43.216
we could go and we could talk to Ava first, or Fjord.

926
00:34:43.216 --> 00:34:44.654
TRAVIS: If you want to go to the archives,

927
00:34:44.654 --> 00:34:46.987
I'd be happy to talk to her.

928
00:34:47.831 --> 00:34:50.118
LIAM: That's your strong suit.

929
00:34:50.118 --> 00:34:52.912
LAURA: I could help you, Fjord.

930
00:34:52.912 --> 00:34:53.745
MARISHA: I'll go with you, too.

931
00:34:53.745 --> 00:34:57.747
LAURA: He can hold entire worms with a whip.

932
00:34:57.747 --> 00:35:01.114
TRAVIS: Hold worms, yep. Hold the worms.

933
00:35:01.114 --> 00:35:04.121
TALIESIN: Possibly refined residuum.

934
00:35:04.121 --> 00:35:08.275
And we need to find some mithral.

935
00:35:08.275 --> 00:35:10.439
TRAVIS: Yes, do we have a lead on mithral?

936
00:35:10.439 --> 00:35:11.272
LIAM: Well, maybe the trading post,

937
00:35:11.272 --> 00:35:13.268
that's a good place to start for that.

938
00:35:13.268 --> 00:35:15.387
SAM: Didn't Umi tell us that she would have some?

939
00:35:15.387 --> 00:35:16.728
TALIESIN: -- everybody who's looking for everything

940
00:35:16.728 --> 00:35:17.787
everywhere.

941
00:35:17.787 --> 00:35:18.620
SAM: Let's go talk to her.

942
00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.789
TALIESIN: Inevitably, the right path is going to open up.

943
00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:23.577
We already have divine intervention.

944
00:35:23.577 --> 00:35:25.203
LIAM: I don't know how long we're going to be here,

945
00:35:25.203 --> 00:35:26.777
we never seem to stay in one place for long,

946
00:35:26.777 --> 00:35:29.380
so I would like to go to the archive as soon as possible.

947
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.521
After tea and wine, I assume.

948
00:35:30.521 --> 00:35:32.442
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll go with you, we can do some research,

949
00:35:32.442 --> 00:35:34.293
figure out the white dragon, maybe some mithral,

950
00:35:34.293 --> 00:35:38.425
maybe some other things, we'll hit the books.

951
00:35:38.425 --> 00:35:39.590
TALIESIN: Do you actually hit the book?

952
00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.254
I can imagine you hitting the the books, though.

953
00:35:41.254 --> 00:35:43.260
MARISHA: They make great targets.

954
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.119
TRAVIS: Then let's have that tea and wine and be on our way.

955
00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:49.487
MICA: I start to serve everyone their tea and wine.

956
00:35:49.487 --> 00:35:50.543
And cookies from last week.

957
00:35:50.543 --> 00:35:51.376
LAURA: Yes!

958
00:35:51.376 --> 00:35:52.600
MICA: Sorry, they're a little stale.
LAURA: What kind of cookies?

959
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.624
MICA: They're chocolate chip.

960
00:35:53.624 --> 00:35:56.016
LAURA: That's delicious. Do you have any milk?

961
00:35:56.016 --> 00:35:57.506
MICA: I don't.

962
00:35:57.506 --> 00:35:59.595
LAURA: That's okay, that's okay, tea is really good.

963
00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:00.539
SAM: Insight check.

964
00:36:00.539 --> 00:36:02.147
(laughter)

965
00:36:02.147 --> 00:36:03.787
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

966
00:36:03.787 --> 00:36:05.203
SAM: 10.

967
00:36:06.057 --> 00:36:08.635
TALIESIN: (laughs)

968
00:36:08.635 --> 00:36:10.721
MATT: You can't tell if you're getting the entire truth,

969
00:36:10.721 --> 00:36:14.387
but a little part of you thinks that maybe,

970
00:36:14.387 --> 00:36:16.105
she might be out of milk.

971
00:36:16.105 --> 00:36:18.596
Maybe didn't have it to begin with.

972
00:36:18.596 --> 00:36:20.465
SAM: This one's hard to read.

973
00:36:20.465 --> 00:36:22.099
TALIESIN: Only soy milk or almond milk,

974
00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:23.564
there's no actual milk in this.

975
00:36:23.564 --> 00:36:25.172
LIAM: No cattle.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

976
00:36:25.172 --> 00:36:27.129
MATT: There's goats. They have goat milk here.

977
00:36:27.129 --> 00:36:28.457
TALIESIN: Goat milk, is that beast milk?

978
00:36:28.457 --> 00:36:29.598
MATT: Goat milk is actually pretty popular

979
00:36:29.598 --> 00:36:30.732
in dwarven societies.

980
00:36:30.732 --> 00:36:31.565
TRAVIS: I don't mean to pry,

981
00:36:31.565 --> 00:36:34.318
but that scimitar you have is quite impressive.

982
00:36:34.318 --> 00:36:37.742
MICA: Thanks, I kill a lot of things with it!

983
00:36:37.742 --> 00:36:39.205
TRAVIS: I gather.
MICA: Yeah.

984
00:36:39.205 --> 00:36:41.231
TRAVIS: Is that a wand in your belt?

985
00:36:41.231 --> 00:36:42.601
MICA: Yeah!

986
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:45.401
TRAVIS: What do you prefer, the wand or the sword?

987
00:36:45.401 --> 00:36:48.215
MICA: Well, I prefer...

988
00:36:48.215 --> 00:36:49.382
I prefer to...

989
00:36:50.725 --> 00:36:52.473
Maybe I should just show you.

990
00:36:52.473 --> 00:36:57.005
I want to Wild Shape into a wolf.

991
00:36:57.005 --> 00:36:58.388
MATT: A standard wolf?
MICA: A standard wolf.

992
00:36:58.388 --> 00:37:00.804
I don't think a dire wolf would fit in here.

993
00:37:00.804 --> 00:37:02.562
MATT and MICA: It'd be pretty tight quarters.

994
00:37:02.562 --> 00:37:04.827
MATT: You watch as Reani takes a moment and then

995
00:37:04.827 --> 00:37:09.827
shifts the entire body magically into a wolfen form.

996
00:37:09.915 --> 00:37:11.037
MARISHA: She's a druid.

997
00:37:11.037 --> 00:37:12.266
MICA: I'll spin around in a circle

998
00:37:12.266 --> 00:37:15.244
and I'll sit in the dog bed.

999
00:37:15.244 --> 00:37:17.744
LAURA: Is the dog bed for you?

1000
00:37:19.552 --> 00:37:22.397
How long can you stay a dog?

1001
00:37:22.397 --> 00:37:23.549
LIAM: That is a wolf.

1002
00:37:23.549 --> 00:37:26.822
MICA: Un-wild shape.
TRAVIS: Can you bark?

1003
00:37:26.822 --> 00:37:29.722
MICA: I just, I don't know, sometimes it's comfy.

1004
00:37:29.722 --> 00:37:30.555
SAM: Wow.

1005
00:37:30.555 --> 00:37:32.401
LAURA: I really like, sometimes I'm an animal, too

1006
00:37:32.401 --> 00:37:33.234
MICA: What?

1007
00:37:33.234 --> 00:37:34.233
LAURA: And it's really really fun.

1008
00:37:34.233 --> 00:37:35.066
MICA: Right?

1009
00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:36.351
Sometimes I like to sleep as a dog

1010
00:37:36.351 --> 00:37:38.322
because I dunno, it's comfy.

1011
00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:39.639
LAURA: I will try that.

1012
00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:40.504
I've never thought to do that.

1013
00:37:40.504 --> 00:37:44.936
MICA: You'll get a great night's sleep, I promise.

1014
00:37:44.936 --> 00:37:47.929
LAURA: This one time I was a moth and I ate curtains.

1015
00:37:47.929 --> 00:37:48.998
MICA: Are curtains tasty?

1016
00:37:48.998 --> 00:37:50.158
LAURA: They were at the time.

1017
00:37:50.158 --> 00:37:51.504
MICA: Well, now I got to try it!
LAURA: Yeah.

1018
00:37:51.504 --> 00:37:54.286
MICA: I'll take your word for it!

1019
00:37:54.286 --> 00:37:57.293
TRAVIS: How far is the archive from where we are now,

1020
00:37:57.293 --> 00:37:59.104
do you know, Reani?

1021
00:37:59.104 --> 00:38:01.426
MATT: It's maybe about an hour's walk.

1022
00:38:01.426 --> 00:38:03.582
MICA: It's about an hour's walk.

1023
00:38:03.582 --> 00:38:05.912
I can pack snacks. Does anybody want snacks?

1024
00:38:05.912 --> 00:38:07.163
LAURA: Yes!
TALIESIN: I always like snacks.

1025
00:38:07.163 --> 00:38:08.540
SAM: Well, we're going to two different places, right?

1026
00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.373
MICA: Wait, what?

1027
00:38:09.373 --> 00:38:10.859
SAM: Some of us are going to the Plexus Post

1028
00:38:10.859 --> 00:38:12.976
with you to meet Ava.

1029
00:38:12.976 --> 00:38:13.809
MICA: Okay.

1030
00:38:13.809 --> 00:38:15.982
SAM: Then our learned gentleman here

1031
00:38:15.982 --> 00:38:17.616
wants to go to the archive.

1032
00:38:17.616 --> 00:38:18.583
MICA: I know guys at the archives,

1033
00:38:18.583 --> 00:38:21.545
I can go with you after if you want!

1034
00:38:21.545 --> 00:38:22.880
LIAM: Could you--

1035
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.356
is the archive on the way to the Plexus Post?

1036
00:38:26.356 --> 00:38:28.125
Further down into the city?

1037
00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:30.474
MATT: (laughs)

1038
00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:32.242
The Plexus Post is actually on the way to the archive.

1039
00:38:32.242 --> 00:38:35.096
The archive is the furthest distance.

1040
00:38:35.096 --> 00:38:36.625
It's right on the cusp of the bottom disc.

1041
00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:37.458
MARISHA: We should all go together.

1042
00:38:37.458 --> 00:38:38.775
MICA: It's better to stick together.

1043
00:38:38.775 --> 00:38:39.957
SAM: We'll be on the way.

1044
00:38:39.957 --> 00:38:42.414
MARISHA: Listen to the angel, it's better to stick together.

1045
00:38:42.414 --> 00:38:46.447
TRAVIS: At the first sign of hesitation, you can leave.

1046
00:38:46.447 --> 00:38:48.442
LIAM: Books.

1047
00:38:48.442 --> 00:38:50.355
TALIESIN: Hopefully you'll get a presentation.

1048
00:38:50.355 --> 00:38:52.627
MICA: If I give you one of my books to hold,

1049
00:38:52.627 --> 00:38:53.705
would you feel better?

1050
00:38:53.705 --> 00:38:55.442
LIAM: Do you have any good books?

1051
00:38:55.442 --> 00:38:58.648
MICA: I have a lot of books about plants.

1052
00:38:58.648 --> 00:39:00.260
LIAM: I'll take it.
MICA: Do you want a book about plants?

1053
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.612
LIAM: Could one be a loaner?

1054
00:39:02.612 --> 00:39:05.482
MICA: Okay I'll, no, you can have it!

1055
00:39:05.482 --> 00:39:06.477
(giggles)

1056
00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.234
I'm going to go to my tiny little bookshelf

1057
00:39:08.234 --> 00:39:10.526
and just get a book.

1058
00:39:10.526 --> 00:39:11.734
Here.

1059
00:39:11.734 --> 00:39:13.989
It's about plants you can make poisons out of,

1060
00:39:13.989 --> 00:39:15.012
I hope you like it.

1061
00:39:15.012 --> 00:39:16.133
SAM: Ooh.

1062
00:39:16.133 --> 00:39:17.629
LIAM: I start to speed read.

1063
00:39:17.629 --> 00:39:19.114
SAM: I might want to take a look at that one.

1064
00:39:19.114 --> 00:39:22.033
MARISHA: So you know, actually we had a,

1065
00:39:22.033 --> 00:39:25.942
we have-- we <i>have</i> a friend

1066
00:39:25.942 --> 00:39:29.279
who was also, <i>is</i> also,

1067
00:39:29.279 --> 00:39:30.913
fuck, an aasimar.

1068
00:39:30.913 --> 00:39:33.761
MICA: Cool.
SAM: She's an enemy.

1069
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:35.484
MICA: I was trying to be positive.

1070
00:39:35.484 --> 00:39:38.651
LAURA: She had a bad time.

1071
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:42.159
She is no longer a good person.

1072
00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:43.096
MICA: Oh.

1073
00:39:43.096 --> 00:39:44.105
LAURA: Maybe.

1074
00:39:44.105 --> 00:39:45.696
TALIESIN: She's still a good person.

1075
00:39:45.696 --> 00:39:48.546
LAURA: She's stuck being a bad person right now.

1076
00:39:48.546 --> 00:39:50.303
SAM: She might not have ever been a good person.

1077
00:39:50.303 --> 00:39:51.227
LAURA: Yes, she was.

1078
00:39:51.227 --> 00:39:52.993
MICA: I'm getting a lot of different stories here.

1079
00:39:52.993 --> 00:39:54.141
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it.

1080
00:39:54.141 --> 00:39:55.666
MARISHA: She was very enigmatic.

1081
00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:57.762
LIAM: We've lost a friend for the moment.

1082
00:39:57.762 --> 00:39:59.461
MICA: Okay.

1083
00:39:59.461 --> 00:40:00.845
LIAM: It's a raw subject.

1084
00:40:00.845 --> 00:40:02.269
MICA: That sucks.

1085
00:40:02.269 --> 00:40:04.269
MARISHA: I just didn't know if,

1086
00:40:05.259 --> 00:40:07.198
this is going to sound like a dumb question,

1087
00:40:07.198 --> 00:40:12.081
but if there wasn't some sort of communication system--

1088
00:40:13.325 --> 00:40:14.490
SAM: Among the aasimar?

1089
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:15.323
MARISHA: Yeah.

1090
00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:18.181
MICA: No.

1091
00:40:19.769 --> 00:40:22.535
I mean, do you know

1092
00:40:22.535 --> 00:40:26.418
if your friend has an angel friend, too?

1093
00:40:26.418 --> 00:40:28.917
SAM: Bad devil friend.

1094
00:40:28.917 --> 00:40:32.944
MICA: Oh, well then, if she was bad, I'd have to kill her.

1095
00:40:32.944 --> 00:40:34.223
SAM: Ooh.

1096
00:40:34.223 --> 00:40:36.260
MICA: Sorry, those are the rules.

1097
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.546
TRAVIS: Sorry, what rule is that?

1098
00:40:37.546 --> 00:40:40.429
MICA: The rule is that evil dies.

1099
00:40:40.429 --> 00:40:41.262
TRAVIS: Evil dies.

1100
00:40:41.262 --> 00:40:42.174
MICA: Evil dies.

1101
00:40:42.174 --> 00:40:44.814
LAURA: Oh no, does this mean this white dragon is evil?

1102
00:40:44.814 --> 00:40:46.939
MICA: I don't know, Samliel didn't tell me.

1103
00:40:46.939 --> 00:40:48.469
All I heard was "Dragon!"

1104
00:40:48.469 --> 00:40:49.637
LAURA: He didn't go "Dragon: kill?"

1105
00:40:49.637 --> 00:40:51.300
MICA: No, just "Dragon!"

1106
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.150
TRAVIS: You have to kill evil, not evil dies in general,

1107
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.891
you are tasked with destroying evil?

1108
00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:59.714
MICA: If there is evil, I will kill it.

1109
00:40:59.714 --> 00:41:02.325
MARISHA: How do you know the difference between what's evil

1110
00:41:02.325 --> 00:41:05.451
and maybe someone who's just confused or complicated?

1111
00:41:05.451 --> 00:41:06.564
LIAM: Yes, what is your stance on--

1112
00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:09.371
MICA: Samliel usually tells me, and I just listen to him.

1113
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:11.285
LIAM: Does he have a stance on gray areas?

1114
00:41:11.285 --> 00:41:12.721
MICA: No.

1115
00:41:12.721 --> 00:41:14.249
TRAVIS: What if you disagree?

1116
00:41:14.249 --> 00:41:15.832
MICA: I don't disagree.

1117
00:41:18.587 --> 00:41:19.674
SAM: Wow.

1118
00:41:19.674 --> 00:41:20.975
MICA: None of you are evil, right?

1119
00:41:20.975 --> 00:41:21.908
LAURA: Nope!
MICA: Cool.

1120
00:41:21.908 --> 00:41:23.648
MARISHA: No.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1121
00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:26.563
TRAVIS: Not today.
TALIESIN: Not really.

1122
00:41:26.563 --> 00:41:27.396
LAURA: He's joking.

1123
00:41:27.396 --> 00:41:28.229
MICA: Okay.

1124
00:41:29.388 --> 00:41:31.509
He liked my flower crown, so he can't be evil.

1125
00:41:31.509 --> 00:41:34.811
LAURA: He's a good guy, he's a super good guy.

1126
00:41:34.811 --> 00:41:37.569
SAM: Shall we set off to the Plexus Post?

1127
00:41:37.569 --> 00:41:38.884
MICA: Yeah!
LAURA: Let's do it!

1128
00:41:38.884 --> 00:41:41.494
MICA: This way, everybody.

1129
00:41:41.494 --> 00:41:43.785
MARISHA: Caduceus, as we walk.

1130
00:41:43.785 --> 00:41:46.061
Does the Wildmother tell you if people are evil

1131
00:41:46.061 --> 00:41:49.955
and gives you assassination tasks?

1132
00:41:49.955 --> 00:41:51.806
TALIESIN: Well, yeah.

1133
00:41:51.806 --> 00:41:52.997
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1134
00:41:52.997 --> 00:41:54.177
Shut the fuck up!

1135
00:41:54.177 --> 00:41:56.844
TALIESIN: No.
(laughter)

1136
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.536
MARISHA: You're just playing the long con!

1137
00:42:05.536 --> 00:42:06.811
MATT: How do you think all those bodies

1138
00:42:06.811 --> 00:42:09.426
made it into that graveyard he grew up in?

1139
00:42:09.426 --> 00:42:11.009
TALIESIN: I made it myself.

1140
00:42:12.435 --> 00:42:13.268
Oh no.

1141
00:42:14.282 --> 00:42:18.541
I do want to just, on the way out, ask her plants:

1142
00:42:18.541 --> 00:42:21.361
Is she on the up-and-up? Everything seems all right?

1143
00:42:21.361 --> 00:42:23.427
You guys see a lot.

1144
00:42:23.427 --> 00:42:25.294
Is she all right?

1145
00:42:25.294 --> 00:42:28.275
MATT: The plants flicker a vibrant green and healthy

1146
00:42:28.275 --> 00:42:30.560
in their sunless abode.

1147
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.845
TALIESIN: That's what I thought. All right, good.

1148
00:42:33.845 --> 00:42:34.903
Excellent.

1149
00:42:36.578 --> 00:42:37.411
MATT: All right.

1150
00:42:37.411 --> 00:42:40.373
LAURA: As we walk, I'm going to whisper to the Traveler.

1151
00:42:40.373 --> 00:42:44.098
Hey, so, apparently

1152
00:42:44.098 --> 00:42:46.055
some people talk to their people

1153
00:42:46.055 --> 00:42:48.467
in dreams and say, "Hey, go find these people,"

1154
00:42:48.467 --> 00:42:51.233
and you don't really tell me

1155
00:42:51.233 --> 00:42:53.712
anybody to really look for necessarily,

1156
00:42:53.712 --> 00:42:56.936
but if you ever want to, you know, feel free.

1157
00:42:56.936 --> 00:42:59.127
Also, do you know anything about the white dragon,

1158
00:42:59.127 --> 00:43:01.544
because that could be helpful.

1159
00:43:04.919 --> 00:43:06.353
MATT: Out of the corner of your eye, Reani,

1160
00:43:06.353 --> 00:43:11.353
you just see Jester quietly talking to herself emphatically.

1161
00:43:12.204 --> 00:43:15.815
Continuing, you guys are led through the main auger,

1162
00:43:15.815 --> 00:43:19.729
Auger Road, further down, through the Liber Disk,

1163
00:43:19.729 --> 00:43:20.846
until eventually you come upon

1164
00:43:20.846 --> 00:43:23.826
a rather gaudy-looking building that you can see

1165
00:43:23.826 --> 00:43:27.539
already the entranceway is like a double-set door

1166
00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:29.069
and with a little bit of the window light

1167
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:30.404
you can see inside,

1168
00:43:30.404 --> 00:43:32.614
there are multi-colored paper lanterns that are

1169
00:43:32.614 --> 00:43:35.542
clustered and jammed in corners.

1170
00:43:35.542 --> 00:43:38.879
You can see bits and scraps of colored material and silks

1171
00:43:38.879 --> 00:43:41.882
covering most of the windows themselves.

1172
00:43:41.882 --> 00:43:45.009
There's a sign out front that says The Plexus Post.

1173
00:43:45.009 --> 00:43:47.396
It just remains still,

1174
00:43:47.396 --> 00:43:48.855
not much in the way of noise or traffic

1175
00:43:48.855 --> 00:43:51.527
making its way in or out.

1176
00:43:51.527 --> 00:43:53.947
TRAVIS: Remind me again, we're talking to Ava?

1177
00:43:53.947 --> 00:43:55.252
MARISHA: Ava.

1178
00:43:55.252 --> 00:43:57.045
Master Ava.

1179
00:43:57.045 --> 00:43:58.706
TALIESIN: Well, this looks good.

1180
00:43:58.706 --> 00:44:00.405
MARISHA: She's apparently the collector.

1181
00:44:00.405 --> 00:44:04.407
I mean, Reani seems to know far more about her.

1182
00:44:04.407 --> 00:44:05.959
MICA: Don't make her mad!

1183
00:44:05.959 --> 00:44:08.558
TRAVIS: Don't make her mad, don't offer any flower wreaths.

1184
00:44:08.558 --> 00:44:09.913
LIAM: No flowers.
MICA: Unfortunately.

1185
00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:11.830
LIAM: Or crowns, no crowns.

1186
00:44:13.254 --> 00:44:14.943
TRAVIS: And we're looking for mithral.

1187
00:44:14.943 --> 00:44:17.838
SAM: Yes, and anything about dragons she might know.

1188
00:44:17.838 --> 00:44:19.343
TRAVIS: All right.

1189
00:44:19.343 --> 00:44:23.193
MARISHA: I'm going to stay out here and keep watch, I think.

1190
00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:25.026
Just survey the scene.

1191
00:44:26.004 --> 00:44:28.962
TALIESIN: So paranoid.
LAURA: I'll stay out there with Beau.

1192
00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:32.291
TALIESIN: All right.

1193
00:44:32.291 --> 00:44:33.421
SAM: I'm going in as well.

1194
00:44:33.421 --> 00:44:34.876
TALIESIN: I'm definitely going in.

1195
00:44:34.876 --> 00:44:37.675
MATT: Okay, who all's going inside?

1196
00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:40.532
LAURA: I will be going in in a moment after I finish

1197
00:44:40.532 --> 00:44:44.841
making the Plexus Post look like the Penis Post.

1198
00:44:44.841 --> 00:44:46.731
MATT: So you're painting on the sign?

1199
00:44:46.731 --> 00:44:48.225
MARISHA: I stand guard.

1200
00:44:48.225 --> 00:44:49.720
MATT: Okay.

1201
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.076
Make a sleight of hand check.

1202
00:44:52.076 --> 00:44:53.188
SAM: It's pretty easy.

1203
00:44:53.188 --> 00:44:54.644
LAURA: Yeah, I looked, I checked it out.

1204
00:44:54.644 --> 00:44:55.719
TRAVIS: What if Reani thinks you're evil

1205
00:44:55.719 --> 00:44:56.977
and kills you for doing this?

1206
00:44:56.977 --> 00:44:58.222
LAURA: It's not evil, it's fun.

1207
00:44:58.222 --> 00:45:01.165
19! Plus

1208
00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:02.242
eight, 27.

1209
00:45:02.242 --> 00:45:03.625
MICA: Power of the penis.

1210
00:45:03.625 --> 00:45:07.991
MATT: In a very impressive display

1211
00:45:07.991 --> 00:45:10.574
of Banksy-level street art,

1212
00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:14.123
you rapidly scrawl across the Plexus Post sign

1213
00:45:14.123 --> 00:45:16.887
and leave it as intended.

1214
00:45:16.887 --> 00:45:18.502
LIAM: Hope you didn't use your magic paint.

1215
00:45:18.502 --> 00:45:19.335
LAURA: Nope.

1216
00:45:19.335 --> 00:45:21.585
LIAM: (thudding)

1217
00:45:24.408 --> 00:45:25.889
SAM: ♪ Jester's world of dicks! ♪

1218
00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:28.139
(laughter)

1219
00:45:29.253 --> 00:45:30.285
MATT: All right.

1220
00:45:30.285 --> 00:45:31.852
You enter through the front doors; a familiar sight to you,

1221
00:45:31.852 --> 00:45:34.554
but the rest of you see

1222
00:45:34.554 --> 00:45:39.549
the most organized hoarder experience you could imagine

1223
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:41.883
in a subterranean elf-dwarven city.

1224
00:45:41.883 --> 00:45:46.700
It is just floor-to-ceiling canisters and bags,

1225
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.156
and little boxes, each with little labels and tags on them,

1226
00:45:50.156 --> 00:45:53.988
just from floor to ceiling, awkwardly set in ways

1227
00:45:53.988 --> 00:45:56.727
where some look like they're about to tumble over.

1228
00:45:56.727 --> 00:46:00.054
Everything looks cluttered but organized,

1229
00:46:00.054 --> 00:46:01.082
if that makes sense.

1230
00:46:01.082 --> 00:46:04.864
Like, it's a mass amount of all sorts of

1231
00:46:04.864 --> 00:46:06.462
containers of different sizes

1232
00:46:06.462 --> 00:46:08.358
and strange scents immediately hit you

1233
00:46:08.358 --> 00:46:11.133
that are a combination of

1234
00:46:11.133 --> 00:46:13.543
scented candles and dried ceder

1235
00:46:13.543 --> 00:46:17.468
meets a musty fungal smell

1236
00:46:17.468 --> 00:46:19.081
and as soon as you take the next step,

1237
00:46:19.081 --> 00:46:21.946
that shifts again into dried meats

1238
00:46:21.946 --> 00:46:26.321
and long-dusty leather,

1239
00:46:26.321 --> 00:46:27.523
and the next step leads you into

1240
00:46:27.523 --> 00:46:31.003
the smells of wet metal.

1241
00:46:31.003 --> 00:46:35.150
It is a strange interior and is immediately imposing

1242
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:39.632
and it feels like you're walking into a warehouse

1243
00:46:39.632 --> 00:46:42.942
that you have no idea what lies in here.

1244
00:46:42.942 --> 00:46:44.481
As soon as you enter with what low light

1245
00:46:44.481 --> 00:46:45.636
there is from some lanterns around you,

1246
00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:47.122
and the scraps of material that hang

1247
00:46:47.122 --> 00:46:50.122
in front of the windows and parts of the ceiling.

1248
00:46:50.122 --> 00:46:52.221
Across the way, you see a figure spin around

1249
00:46:52.221 --> 00:46:55.790
in a little swiveling stool, currently in the process of

1250
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:58.359
holding a tiny knickknack

1251
00:46:58.359 --> 00:47:00.754
in hand with a paintbrush.

1252
00:47:00.754 --> 00:47:05.444
You see an elven woman with wide shoulders

1253
00:47:05.444 --> 00:47:08.513
and a faint mustache of dark gray-green color

1254
00:47:08.513 --> 00:47:13.198
that matches her long gray-green hair, very fine and thin.

1255
00:47:13.198 --> 00:47:15.889
She's dressed in a patterned frock

1256
00:47:15.889 --> 00:47:20.889
of Marquesian make under a cotton robe.

1257
00:47:21.277 --> 00:47:24.861
She turns around, looks at you,

1258
00:47:25.708 --> 00:47:27.658
places her little knickknack

1259
00:47:27.658 --> 00:47:30.967
and brush on the side, and stands up,

1260
00:47:30.967 --> 00:47:35.967
in this awkward, stilted way, and approaches,

1261
00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:38.309
upper body almost unmoving as the feet swivel

1262
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:42.163
one in front of the other, the head slightly tilted.

1263
00:47:42.163 --> 00:47:44.669
"Might I help you?"

1264
00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:48.097
LIAM: Yeah, we are new to this city,

1265
00:47:48.097 --> 00:47:50.127
and we are here for a few things,

1266
00:47:50.127 --> 00:47:52.811
some supplies for our journey

1267
00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:55.811
and also to do a bit of fact-finding

1268
00:47:56.945 --> 00:47:58.888
and believe it or not,

1269
00:47:58.888 --> 00:48:00.734
we are searching for some mithral in town,

1270
00:48:00.734 --> 00:48:03.412
I don't suppose you have anything for sale, ha ha ha?

1271
00:48:03.412 --> 00:48:06.112
MATT: "Ha ha ha, I can check.

1272
00:48:06.112 --> 00:48:07.695
"I have many things.

1273
00:48:10.256 --> 00:48:11.387
"Many things."

1274
00:48:11.387 --> 00:48:13.097
MARISHA: Hey, Mark!

1275
00:48:13.097 --> 00:48:15.832
MATT: "All I ask is you stay put, please."

1276
00:48:15.832 --> 00:48:17.033
TALIESIN: Of course.

1277
00:48:17.033 --> 00:48:18.780
MATT: "Stay put, I'll look."

1278
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.313
SAM: Okay.

1279
00:48:20.313 --> 00:48:23.031
MATT: She turns around (whooshes) and whisks off

1280
00:48:23.031 --> 00:48:24.045
and then vanishes down one of the aisles

1281
00:48:24.045 --> 00:48:27.028
and you can hear things shifting out of sight,

1282
00:48:27.028 --> 00:48:30.557
boxes being moved, and things clattering to the ground.

1283
00:48:30.557 --> 00:48:31.854
It sounds like a pot, almost like

1284
00:48:31.854 --> 00:48:34.084
ping ping ping ping ping over the side,

1285
00:48:34.084 --> 00:48:35.046
and "Oh, shit!"

1286
00:48:35.046 --> 00:48:38.985
TRAVIS: Reani, how often do you speak with Ava?

1287
00:48:38.985 --> 00:48:41.939
MICA: I try not to, but I got to pay rent.

1288
00:48:41.939 --> 00:48:43.653
She takes all my things and she gives me money

1289
00:48:43.653 --> 00:48:44.838
and so like, I dunno.

1290
00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:47.553
SAM: She pays you?
MICA: Once a month I give her stuff.

1291
00:48:47.553 --> 00:48:49.388
TRAVIS: She knows you're resourceful.

1292
00:48:49.388 --> 00:48:51.488
MICA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

1293
00:48:51.488 --> 00:48:52.850
LAURA: She takes your things?

1294
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:53.862
MICA: She takes my things.

1295
00:48:53.862 --> 00:48:55.633
SAM: What do you mean, she takes your things?

1296
00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:57.703
MICA: I give her, I give her things.

1297
00:48:57.703 --> 00:48:58.977
Trade things.
SAM: Oh, I see, I see.

1298
00:48:58.977 --> 00:49:01.226
LIAM: What kind of things do you trade to her?

1299
00:49:01.226 --> 00:49:03.527
MICA: Things, you know, I've been around.

1300
00:49:03.527 --> 00:49:05.606
Just stuff that I found, I found some dungeons

1301
00:49:05.606 --> 00:49:08.463
and they had some mystical artifacts in them or whatever,

1302
00:49:08.463 --> 00:49:10.017
and so I keep them,

1303
00:49:10.017 --> 00:49:13.246
and so sometimes I give them to her because she wants them.

1304
00:49:13.246 --> 00:49:14.079
LIAM: Okay.

1305
00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:18.038
MICA: She still doesn't take my flower crowns, whatever.

1306
00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:19.875
MATT: The figure turns back, coming along the way

1307
00:49:19.875 --> 00:49:23.070
with a small wooden box

1308
00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:26.633
with a number of shiny things poking out the top,

1309
00:49:26.633 --> 00:49:30.425
and sets it down on the table where she was sitting.

1310
00:49:30.425 --> 00:49:34.770
"You may come now, please, to my desk, if you don't mind."

1311
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:35.708
TALIESIN: Of course, of course.

1312
00:49:35.708 --> 00:49:38.842
SAM: Does she look like a bunch of kobolds in a--

1313
00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:40.747
(laughter)

1314
00:49:40.747 --> 00:49:42.542
MATT: Make a perception check.

1315
00:49:42.542 --> 00:49:43.650
TRAVIS: Come on, higher than 10.

1316
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:46.659
SAM: 17.
MATT: 17.

1317
00:49:46.659 --> 00:49:50.913
You glance around, across the robe, intently looking.

1318
00:49:50.913 --> 00:49:53.484
No signs of kobolds, but your eyes meet her

1319
00:49:53.484 --> 00:49:56.117
intently noticing you intently looking at her and goes,

1320
00:49:56.117 --> 00:49:57.592
"Tsk, tsk tsk."

1321
00:49:57.592 --> 00:49:59.328
SAM: Sorry, sorry.

1322
00:49:59.328 --> 00:50:00.686
MARISHA: She didn't like eye contact?

1323
00:50:00.686 --> 00:50:02.603
SAM: I was scoping her.

1324
00:50:04.674 --> 00:50:07.182
MATT: "I have some mithral things,

1325
00:50:07.182 --> 00:50:08.982
"perhaps you're interested,"

1326
00:50:08.982 --> 00:50:10.447
and sets the box down. You look inside.

1327
00:50:10.447 --> 00:50:15.047
There are a mithral teacup,

1328
00:50:15.047 --> 00:50:16.665
a small figurine,

1329
00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:18.731
they're all just little things that've been

1330
00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:22.685
crafted or pressed or molded to be collectibles,

1331
00:50:22.685 --> 00:50:24.883
and apparently made of mithral,

1332
00:50:24.883 --> 00:50:27.590
the material itself looks beautiful,

1333
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:32.087
but it's not like a bar of ore by any means.

1334
00:50:32.087 --> 00:50:36.944
LAURA: Oh man, I wonder how much old Umi needs.

1335
00:50:36.944 --> 00:50:39.444
TALIESIN: What do you do with a mithral teacup?

1336
00:50:39.444 --> 00:50:40.514
LAURA: Drink out of it!

1337
00:50:40.514 --> 00:50:43.407
TALIESIN: Well-- well, that's fair.

1338
00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:44.887
Yeah.

1339
00:50:44.887 --> 00:50:47.141
MICA: If you're really fancy.

1340
00:50:47.141 --> 00:50:49.003
MATT: "The nobles have strange tastes,

1341
00:50:49.003 --> 00:50:50.228
"and when they get

1342
00:50:50.228 --> 00:50:53.036
"sick of their old things and buy new ones,

1343
00:50:53.036 --> 00:50:55.284
"well, they find their way to me."

1344
00:50:55.284 --> 00:50:56.117
TALIESIN: Huh.

1345
00:50:56.117 --> 00:51:00.019
TRAVIS: Just as a means of measure, that particular teacup,

1346
00:51:00.019 --> 00:51:01.393
very charming.

1347
00:51:01.393 --> 00:51:04.531
How much would you require for that?

1348
00:51:04.531 --> 00:51:06.801
MATT: "Oh, for that teacup there? Let's see.

1349
00:51:06.801 --> 00:51:09.151
"Fine craftsmanship, mithral as itself

1350
00:51:09.151 --> 00:51:12.044
"is a fantastic material, especially for crafting,

1351
00:51:12.044 --> 00:51:15.286
"pliable, but light, and strong and sturdy.

1352
00:51:15.286 --> 00:51:16.859
"That is meant to last many lifetimes,

1353
00:51:16.859 --> 00:51:19.276
"something you pass down from generation to generation.

1354
00:51:19.276 --> 00:51:23.526
"That teacup I'd say would run you about

1355
00:51:23.526 --> 00:51:25.337
"75 gold pieces."

1356
00:51:25.337 --> 00:51:26.711
LAURA: Oh, okay okay!

1357
00:51:26.711 --> 00:51:28.379
SAM: How much for all of it together?

1358
00:51:28.379 --> 00:51:29.690
MATT: "All of this, the box here?

1359
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:31.552
"Oh, you're looking for quite a bit, aren't you,

1360
00:51:31.552 --> 00:51:33.959
"little one? You're such a minx."

1361
00:51:33.959 --> 00:51:37.859
(laughter)

1362
00:51:37.859 --> 00:51:41.589
She looks very passively-aggressively unhappy

1363
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:43.922
with being eyeballed by you.

1364
00:51:44.774 --> 00:51:47.441
"For the box entirely, I'd say...

1365
00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:52.165
"800 gold."

1366
00:51:52.165 --> 00:51:54.194
LAURA: That's a lot.

1367
00:51:54.194 --> 00:51:55.832
MATT: "It's a lot of mithral."

1368
00:51:55.832 --> 00:51:57.736
LAURA: Yeah, I know, I just don't know if we need that much,

1369
00:51:57.736 --> 00:51:58.914
I'm not sure.

1370
00:51:58.914 --> 00:51:59.988
MATT: "Well, then, grab a few things

1371
00:51:59.988 --> 00:52:01.503
"and we'll pay for them individually.

1372
00:52:01.503 --> 00:52:03.802
"I don't have all day, make your choices."

1373
00:52:03.802 --> 00:52:04.745
LAURA: She's so mean.

1374
00:52:04.745 --> 00:52:06.453
MICA: I told you she's mean!

1375
00:52:06.453 --> 00:52:09.787
TALIESIN: I quite like it, it's fascinating.

1376
00:52:09.787 --> 00:52:12.604
I don't mean to ask, but since it seems like

1377
00:52:12.604 --> 00:52:14.364
we might do a bit of shopping here, I'm also,

1378
00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:16.134
we're looking for some refined residuum,

1379
00:52:16.134 --> 00:52:18.910
if you have anything like that.

1380
00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.917
MATT: "I'm not entirely certain I know what that is."

1381
00:52:21.917 --> 00:52:24.787
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, wow, you don't know what residuum?

1382
00:52:24.787 --> 00:52:25.620
Wow.

1383
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.887
MATT: "I know of residuum.

1384
00:52:26.887 --> 00:52:28.964
"I have some residuum.

1385
00:52:28.964 --> 00:52:30.741
"Refined residuum, describe that to me."

1386
00:52:30.741 --> 00:52:33.380
TALIESIN: Oh, it's like residuum,

1387
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.604
but a denser, larger, pure crystal,

1388
00:52:37.604 --> 00:52:39.338
a big green crystal of it,

1389
00:52:39.338 --> 00:52:41.219
I guess would be the best way of--

1390
00:52:41.219 --> 00:52:42.402
MATT: "Green crystal."

1391
00:52:42.402 --> 00:52:43.348
TALIESIN: Big green crystal.

1392
00:52:43.348 --> 00:52:45.312
MATT: "I'll be back, pink one!"

1393
00:52:45.312 --> 00:52:48.258
She stands up and drifts off again.

1394
00:52:48.258 --> 00:52:49.599
The feet moving quickly.

1395
00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.066
SAM: Should I steal all the mithral?
TRAVIS: No no no no no.

1396
00:52:51.066 --> 00:52:54.317
SAM: Should I steal some of the mithral? Yes?

1397
00:52:54.317 --> 00:52:58.814
LIAM: Just no, we are going to use our words.

1398
00:52:58.814 --> 00:53:01.929
There is no reason to flip this whole situation upside down.

1399
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:03.813
TALIESIN: We're on a divine mission.

1400
00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.884
You can't be weird about a divine mission.

1401
00:53:05.884 --> 00:53:07.854
MICA: Also, if you steal it, I'll have to kill you.

1402
00:53:07.854 --> 00:53:09.354
TRAVIS: Yes, right.

1403
00:53:11.238 --> 00:53:12.071
SAM: Just wait, so--

1404
00:53:12.071 --> 00:53:14.458
LAURA: But if she's stealing from a bad person.

1405
00:53:14.458 --> 00:53:18.018
MICA: Even though she doesn't take my flower crowns,

1406
00:53:18.018 --> 00:53:21.499
she isn't a bad person, she's just mean.

1407
00:53:21.499 --> 00:53:23.100
SAM: So Reani, you're that hard line,

1408
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:27.386
so if I jaywalked across the street, insta-death.

1409
00:53:27.386 --> 00:53:29.473
Beheading instantly.

1410
00:53:29.473 --> 00:53:31.223
Like where is the line?

1411
00:53:31.223 --> 00:53:33.474
LAURA: What if you're stealing a loaf of bread

1412
00:53:33.474 --> 00:53:34.957
to give it to an orphan?

1413
00:53:34.957 --> 00:53:36.244
SAM: Like in "Les Mis?"

1414
00:53:36.244 --> 00:53:38.350
(laughter)

1415
00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.395
MICA: Well, that's different because then you're doing good.

1416
00:53:40.395 --> 00:53:42.908
But if you're stealing for your own means, then that's bad.

1417
00:53:42.908 --> 00:53:44.495
LAURA: What if we're stealing the mithral

1418
00:53:44.495 --> 00:53:49.235
so we can create a sword that will help save the world?

1419
00:53:49.235 --> 00:53:51.359
LIAM: These are those gray areas we were talking about.

1420
00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:53.901
MICA: Oh, oh gosh, Samliel didn't prepare me for this.

1421
00:53:53.901 --> 00:53:55.892
LAURA: It's all about balance, really.

1422
00:53:55.892 --> 00:53:57.357
MICA: Mmm...

1423
00:53:57.357 --> 00:53:59.399
MATT: You hear an impact heavily and you see

1424
00:53:59.399 --> 00:54:02.321
a jar of some kind

1425
00:54:02.321 --> 00:54:04.520
slams into the ground from off the side alley

1426
00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.547
where you watched Ava disappear down and then

1427
00:54:06.547 --> 00:54:10.022
roll a bit before the top opening

1428
00:54:10.022 --> 00:54:12.593
and a bunch of dust spilling out and you hear,

1429
00:54:12.593 --> 00:54:14.321
"Aw, shit!"

1430
00:54:14.321 --> 00:54:15.781
TRAVIS: Do you need a hand?

1431
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:19.795
MATT: "No, it's all right, just ashes,"

1432
00:54:19.795 --> 00:54:20.926
and darts back off into the side.

1433
00:54:20.926 --> 00:54:22.809
TRAVIS: Does it look like ashes?
MATT: It looks like ashes.

1434
00:54:22.809 --> 00:54:24.042
MICA: You said you're saving the world, right?

1435
00:54:24.042 --> 00:54:26.125
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
MICA: Which is good.

1436
00:54:28.631 --> 00:54:29.834
Can I go to sleep and take a nap

1437
00:54:29.834 --> 00:54:30.878
and see if my angel will talk to me

1438
00:54:30.878 --> 00:54:32.158
because this is really confusing.

1439
00:54:32.158 --> 00:54:33.578
SAM: Okay Reani, don't worry about it,

1440
00:54:33.578 --> 00:54:35.377
I won't steal anything from here,

1441
00:54:35.377 --> 00:54:37.878
you don't have to make a life or death call.

1442
00:54:37.878 --> 00:54:39.112
MICA: Okay.

1443
00:54:39.112 --> 00:54:40.068
TRAVIS: As we're looking around the shop,

1444
00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:43.583
are there any arms or shields or plate armor

1445
00:54:43.583 --> 00:54:47.792
or any other things that adventurers might be looking to--

1446
00:54:47.792 --> 00:54:48.709
MATT: Make a perception check.

1447
00:54:48.709 --> 00:54:50.154
TRAVIS: Acquire.

1448
00:54:50.154 --> 00:54:52.301
LAURA: Also anything that just looks cool.

1449
00:54:52.301 --> 00:54:53.134
TRAVIS: 13.

1450
00:54:53.134 --> 00:54:54.058
MATT: You can make a perception check as well.

1451
00:54:54.058 --> 00:54:56.837
SAM: Yes, I would like to also look for shiny things.

1452
00:54:56.837 --> 00:54:58.058
TALIESIN: I'm also going to cast Detect Magic

1453
00:54:58.058 --> 00:55:00.104
and see if anything pops up.

1454
00:55:00.104 --> 00:55:01.228
MATT: All right.
MICA: I'm going to stand there

1455
00:55:01.228 --> 00:55:02.603
and start crafting more flower crowns.

1456
00:55:02.603 --> 00:55:03.544
MATT: Okay.
SAM: 10.

1457
00:55:03.544 --> 00:55:04.712
MATT: 17, 10.

1458
00:55:04.712 --> 00:55:06.461
LAURA: 14, wait.

1459
00:55:06.461 --> 00:55:07.296
15.

1460
00:55:07.296 --> 00:55:09.283
MATT: 15, okay.

1461
00:55:09.283 --> 00:55:12.897
Looking around, you don't see anything

1462
00:55:12.897 --> 00:55:14.619
that looks visibly armor.

1463
00:55:14.619 --> 00:55:16.790
Most things are put away, like they're locked in the boxes

1464
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:19.335
or set into crates and above higher shelves

1465
00:55:19.335 --> 00:55:22.500
and there's just row after row after row of high shelves,

1466
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.783
floor to ceiling, and the ceiling itself

1467
00:55:23.783 --> 00:55:26.881
probably goes to about 11 or 12 feet up.

1468
00:55:26.881 --> 00:55:29.726
TRAVIS: Entering a Room of Requirement.

1469
00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:31.695
MATT: A little bit.

1470
00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:35.110
At a first glance, you're not entirely certain

1471
00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:36.632
what could be a weapon.

1472
00:55:36.632 --> 00:55:38.066
Some of them are long boxes, short boxes,

1473
00:55:38.066 --> 00:55:40.770
tall boxes, wide boxes, some of them are baskets,

1474
00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:45.283
some-- this is the most mighty haberdashery

1475
00:55:45.283 --> 00:55:47.950
beneath the surface of Exandria.

1476
00:55:49.158 --> 00:55:52.361
Yeah, between you and Nott both,

1477
00:55:52.361 --> 00:55:53.790
you'd have to pore through these

1478
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.633
to really make ends of what's inside.

1479
00:55:56.633 --> 00:56:00.083
SAM: They're boxes, nothing is out and exposed.

1480
00:56:00.083 --> 00:56:01.455
MATT: No, no.

1481
00:56:01.455 --> 00:56:03.167
TRAVIS: No price tag swinging.

1482
00:56:03.167 --> 00:56:05.371
LAURA: Are there any boxes that could be opened?

1483
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:06.762
MATT: I'm sure there's plenty.

1484
00:56:06.762 --> 00:56:08.316
TALIESIN: Anything glowing, though?

1485
00:56:08.316 --> 00:56:09.774
MATT: There are a few things glowing,

1486
00:56:09.774 --> 00:56:12.715
actually, in the vicinity. You...

1487
00:56:15.957 --> 00:56:17.374
do not see anything sticking out,

1488
00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:20.780
but what you do notice is at the top of two of these stacks,

1489
00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.192
you see two tiny creatures.

1490
00:56:23.192 --> 00:56:27.922
They have dark, ashen-gray skin,

1491
00:56:27.922 --> 00:56:31.842
little humanoid face with a pointed nose

1492
00:56:31.842 --> 00:56:34.199
and fanged teeth, little sets of wings,

1493
00:56:34.199 --> 00:56:35.963
they're just perched on top, looking down at you

1494
00:56:35.963 --> 00:56:37.885
with these faintly glowing yellow eyes.

1495
00:56:37.885 --> 00:56:39.049
Little imps, just watching.

1496
00:56:39.049 --> 00:56:40.273
SAM: Security cameras.

1497
00:56:40.273 --> 00:56:41.190
MARISHA: Jester...

1498
00:56:42.503 --> 00:56:44.228
TRAVIS: Imps?
LAURA: Imps.

1499
00:56:46.211 --> 00:56:48.420
TALIESIN: Very standard in any type of shop like this.

1500
00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:50.168
LAURA: Have you seen this before?
MICA: Yeah.

1501
00:56:50.168 --> 00:56:52.236
LAURA: Aren't those bad things?

1502
00:56:52.236 --> 00:56:53.069
MICA: Eh.

1503
00:56:54.129 --> 00:56:56.992
Samliel hasn't said anything, so I let them live.

1504
00:56:56.992 --> 00:56:58.734
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Moral servitude,

1505
00:56:58.734 --> 00:57:00.673
I'm so glad that we're finally getting a bit of this,

1506
00:57:00.673 --> 00:57:02.782
I feel like it's been missing from this group for a while.

1507
00:57:02.782 --> 00:57:04.747
(laughter)

1508
00:57:04.747 --> 00:57:07.046
I'm not saying it's a flavor we have to have all the time,

1509
00:57:07.046 --> 00:57:07.879
but I'm glad--

1510
00:57:07.879 --> 00:57:09.237
TRAVIS: All we needed was the threat of imminent death,

1511
00:57:09.237 --> 00:57:10.238
that's all we needed.

1512
00:57:10.238 --> 00:57:12.058
TALIESIN: I'm glad you're getting a taste.

1513
00:57:12.058 --> 00:57:12.891
That's all I'm saying.
TRAVIS: I don't know,

1514
00:57:12.891 --> 00:57:14.390
if we steal that, you might have to die.

1515
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:15.739
LAURA: Can I wave at them?

1516
00:57:15.739 --> 00:57:16.995
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1517
00:57:16.995 --> 00:57:19.187
The head just turns.

1518
00:57:19.187 --> 00:57:20.558
LAURA: Can I hold up a little bit of cookie

1519
00:57:20.558 --> 00:57:23.445
that I took from her house?

1520
00:57:23.445 --> 00:57:26.130
MATT: The one on, that'd be your left side.

1521
00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:28.983
takes off and snatches out of your hand

1522
00:57:28.983 --> 00:57:31.949
and rushes back up to the perch and (chewing).

1523
00:57:31.949 --> 00:57:33.293
"Thank you."

1524
00:57:33.293 --> 00:57:35.138
TRAVIS: Oh shit, it talks!

1525
00:57:35.138 --> 00:57:36.880
LAURA: You're welcome!

1526
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:38.942
MATT: Then it just keeps watching.

1527
00:57:38.942 --> 00:57:40.878
At which point, Ava turns the corner again,

1528
00:57:40.878 --> 00:57:44.385
has two baskets under each arm,

1529
00:57:44.385 --> 00:57:46.404
different, one's like a dark brown shade

1530
00:57:46.404 --> 00:57:47.796
and the other one's just a dull gray,

1531
00:57:47.796 --> 00:57:49.224
it looks like it's been woven.

1532
00:57:49.224 --> 00:57:51.170
Sets them down.

1533
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:52.243
"All right.

1534
00:57:52.243 --> 00:57:54.927
"Let's see if we have what's necessary,"

1535
00:57:54.927 --> 00:57:56.344
and pulls out what looks to be,

1536
00:57:56.344 --> 00:57:57.792
there are different shards of glass.

1537
00:57:57.792 --> 00:57:59.786
One looks like pieces of elongated crystal

1538
00:57:59.786 --> 00:58:02.222
that have been made into points.

1539
00:58:02.222 --> 00:58:03.799
The coloration's a little off,

1540
00:58:03.799 --> 00:58:06.947
it looks more of like a blueish-clear crystal.

1541
00:58:06.947 --> 00:58:08.503
"I don't think that's it.

1542
00:58:08.503 --> 00:58:10.781
"I do have some residuum."

1543
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:12.263
Sets down a small pouch,

1544
00:58:12.263 --> 00:58:13.961
looks like a snuff pouch if you will,

1545
00:58:13.961 --> 00:58:15.601
but opening it up, you can see inside

1546
00:58:15.601 --> 00:58:18.876
there's a condensed block of residuum

1547
00:58:18.876 --> 00:58:22.093
that's just been pressed.

1548
00:58:22.093 --> 00:58:25.999
She goes ahead and pulls open a wooden box

1549
00:58:25.999 --> 00:58:28.068
with a lock on it.

1550
00:58:28.068 --> 00:58:29.073
You watch Ava look at it

1551
00:58:29.073 --> 00:58:30.580
and do a little signal with a finger

1552
00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.756
and the lock (clicking) opens up.

1553
00:58:32.756 --> 00:58:34.232
(creaks) Opens up and on the inside,

1554
00:58:34.232 --> 00:58:38.944
you do see five elongated shards,

1555
00:58:38.944 --> 00:58:41.519
almost diamond-shape of

1556
00:58:41.519 --> 00:58:44.402
familiar green glass.

1557
00:58:44.402 --> 00:58:47.169
TALIESIN: That's what I'm looking for, right there.

1558
00:58:47.169 --> 00:58:48.911
MATT: "Fantastic, glad to hear it."

1559
00:58:48.911 --> 00:58:51.893
SAM: How much would that cost us?

1560
00:58:51.893 --> 00:58:54.447
MATT: "Ah well, let me go look at my books.

1561
00:58:54.447 --> 00:58:57.783
"I'm not sure what the going rate is for refined residuum."

1562
00:58:57.783 --> 00:58:58.874
TALIESIN: I'll also mention

1563
00:58:58.874 --> 00:59:00.782
that we are happy to discuss trade

1564
00:59:00.782 --> 00:59:04.672
or any sorts of work that may need to be done.

1565
00:59:04.672 --> 00:59:06.058
MATT: "Work, you say?

1566
00:59:06.058 --> 00:59:08.719
"What's your specialties?"

1567
00:59:08.719 --> 00:59:09.552
TALIESIN: Well...

1568
00:59:11.085 --> 00:59:12.892
MATT: "Are you in league with this one?

1569
00:59:12.892 --> 00:59:15.318
"As unique as she may be,

1570
00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:18.755
"she does occasionally bring useful things to me.

1571
00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:23.315
"Are you in a similar sort of wanderlust type lifestyle?"

1572
00:59:23.315 --> 00:59:26.807
TRAVIS: We may be in that very sort of position, actually.

1573
00:59:26.807 --> 00:59:28.961
LIAM: Definitely some overlap.

1574
00:59:28.961 --> 00:59:32.711
MATT: "Now," and you see the eyes look back to you,

1575
00:59:34.634 --> 00:59:39.634
"are you more of the bold creature-hunting type

1576
00:59:39.731 --> 00:59:44.315
"or do your skills lean more subtle?

1577
00:59:44.315 --> 00:59:47.046
"Unseen, quiet?"

1578
00:59:47.046 --> 00:59:50.121
TRAVIS: Actually, we're quite talented in both arenas.

1579
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:51.346
SAM: We were talking about going to

1580
00:59:51.346 --> 00:59:53.431
tangle with a white dragon.

1581
00:59:53.431 --> 00:59:54.820
MATT: "That's ridiculous."

1582
00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:56.962
SAM: Is it, do you know of one around here?

1583
00:59:56.962 --> 00:59:58.247
MATT: "No."
SAM: Okay.

1584
00:59:58.247 --> 01:00:02.380
TALIESIN: We will probably be having an encounter

1585
01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.452
with a white dragon, perhaps before the week is up.

1586
01:00:05.452 --> 01:00:08.702
TRAVIS: However, if you needed more subtle work,

1587
01:00:08.702 --> 01:00:09.544
as you put it,

1588
01:00:09.544 --> 01:00:13.127
accomplished, we might be able to help out.

1589
01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.665
MATT: "Well, then."

1590
01:00:16.665 --> 01:00:19.826
She takes the two baskets off the table,

1591
01:00:19.826 --> 01:00:24.826
leaving the one unlocked case of the residuum glass and goes

1592
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:31.416
"Are you able to bypass barriers unseen,

1593
01:00:31.416 --> 01:00:33.913
"only to return with this none the wiser?"

1594
01:00:33.913 --> 01:00:35.330
LIAM: We have before.

1595
01:00:36.463 --> 01:00:38.421
MATT: "Good.

1596
01:00:38.421 --> 01:00:42.871
"I have a bit of a personal issue

1597
01:00:42.871 --> 01:00:45.836
"with one to the noble families in Uthodurn.

1598
01:00:45.836 --> 01:00:50.835
"They're not very nice, they're not very gracious.

1599
01:00:50.835 --> 01:00:53.635
"They're, well,

1600
01:00:53.635 --> 01:00:55.793
"how do I say it, classless."

1601
01:00:55.793 --> 01:00:57.191
TALIESIN: Mm.

1602
01:00:57.191 --> 01:00:59.685
MATT: "And they've come into the ownership

1603
01:00:59.685 --> 01:01:04.268
"of something that was intended for me, not lawfully so.

1604
01:01:05.939 --> 01:01:08.939
"I would be interested in perhaps you

1605
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:12.371
"finding your way subtly into their estate

1606
01:01:12.371 --> 01:01:16.781
"and returning it to its rightful, paid-for owner."

1607
01:01:16.781 --> 01:01:18.435
LAURA: So they stole it from you.

1608
01:01:18.435 --> 01:01:19.268
MATT: "Yes."

1609
01:01:19.268 --> 01:01:20.768
MICA: So they're evil.

1610
01:01:21.955 --> 01:01:24.788
MATT: "They are immoral and scrupulous."

1611
01:01:26.715 --> 01:01:28.412
LIAM: How believable is this story?

1612
01:01:28.412 --> 01:01:29.978
TALIESIN: I was going to insight check some of this.

1613
01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:31.978
MATT: Make an insight check.

1614
01:01:34.244 --> 01:01:35.202
LIAM: Pretty believable.

1615
01:01:35.202 --> 01:01:36.035
TALIESIN: 14.

1616
01:01:37.963 --> 01:01:39.947
LIAM: Oh, 15.
MATT: 15?

1617
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.897
Her demeanor is so strange and off-kilter

1618
01:01:44.897 --> 01:01:48.004
that you're having a hard time really discerning

1619
01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:51.369
any subtle motive. Seems pretty straightforward.

1620
01:01:51.369 --> 01:01:52.369
LIAM: All right.

1621
01:01:55.102 --> 01:01:59.904
SAM: Who is this royal person and where do they reside?

1622
01:01:59.904 --> 01:02:02.839
MATT: "They are known as the Tumblecarves."

1623
01:02:02.839 --> 01:02:04.181
SAM: Tumblecarves?

1624
01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:06.881
MATT: "Their residence is near the end of the Liber Disk

1625
01:02:06.881 --> 01:02:09.631
"in the affluent Demerant Circle.

1626
01:02:10.921 --> 01:02:14.302
"There's a number of wealthy families that live there, but

01:02:14.302 --> 01:02:15.932
"it shouldn't be too hard to find their estate,

1628
01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:18.079
"a three-story home towards the back wall,

"dual balconies on the second floor.

01:02:23.149 --> 01:02:24.978
"Keep an eye for it."

1632
01:02:24.978 --> 01:02:26.228
SAM: And the item?

1633
01:02:27.984 --> 01:02:31.003
MATT: "They have a ring that belongs to me.

1634
01:02:31.003 --> 01:02:35.447
"They made it part of their personal museum collection.

1635
01:02:35.447 --> 01:02:38.780
"It's a red metal spiral across the band,

01:02:39.621 --> 01:02:41.999
"filigreed ring with elven script set atop

01:02:41.999 --> 01:02:45.665
"by an oval-shaped polished stone of jet.

1638
01:02:45.665 --> 01:02:49.535
"That is my quarry and I would like my property back."

1639
01:02:49.535 --> 01:02:51.302
LAURA: What does the ring do?

1640
01:02:51.302 --> 01:02:52.728
MATT: "That's none of your concern."

1641
01:02:52.728 --> 01:02:54.444
LAURA: Well, what if it's going to kill us

1642
01:02:54.444 --> 01:02:55.277
the minute we pick it up?

1643
01:02:55.277 --> 01:02:56.749
MATT: "It's going to kill you, I assure you."

1644
01:02:56.749 --> 01:02:57.703
LAURA: Is it a good ring then?

1645
01:02:57.703 --> 01:03:00.026
Will it help people when you put it on?

1646
01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:02.848
MATT: "It will help me quite a bit."

1647
01:03:02.848 --> 01:03:04.369
TRAVIS: We only ask in case it's something

1648
01:03:04.369 --> 01:03:07.862
we might be able to utilize in need of quick escape

1649
01:03:07.862 --> 01:03:09.050
to return it to you.

1650
01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:10.598
MATT: "Unfortunately not.

1651
01:03:10.598 --> 01:03:15.281
"It's more of a, more of a subtle enchantment.

1652
01:03:15.281 --> 01:03:16.585
"Don't worry yourself with it."

1653
01:03:16.585 --> 01:03:17.418
TALIESIN: I imagine this'll be

1654
01:03:17.418 --> 01:03:18.751
something that we'd take care of

1655
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:23.077
perhaps after our more pressing matter?

1656
01:03:23.077 --> 01:03:23.910
TRAVIS: Well...

1657
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:26.833
TALIESIN: We can-- one thing at a time, of course.

1658
01:03:26.833 --> 01:03:28.320
Did you want to see anything else in the shop,

1659
01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.056
by the way, since we're here?

1660
01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:33.397
TRAVIS: You noticed a few magical pings, yeah?

1661
01:03:33.397 --> 01:03:36.647
TALIESIN: I was curious about that, that, that.

1662
01:03:37.745 --> 01:03:38.908
LIAM: You keep saying that, like 12 times.

1663
01:03:38.908 --> 01:03:41.945
TALIESIN: That, that, that, that, that.

1664
01:03:41.945 --> 01:03:45.979
Come up with it, Matt! Sorry.

1665
01:03:45.979 --> 01:03:47.449
MATT: So what are you asking about, just...?

1666
01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:48.722
TALIESIN: I am pointing specifically at everything

1667
01:03:48.722 --> 01:03:50.725
that glowed when I was looking around.

1668
01:03:50.725 --> 01:03:52.141
MATT: Okay.

1669
01:03:53.155 --> 01:03:54.182
MICA: Those things.

1670
01:03:54.182 --> 01:03:55.898
MATT: Three of the blips that you saw

1671
01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:58.003
were from a similar space.

1672
01:03:58.003 --> 01:04:03.003
Goes over and takes this small, long box off the shelf,

1673
01:04:03.027 --> 01:04:05.282
sets it down, and slides it open.

1674
01:04:05.282 --> 01:04:08.136
The lid actually pulls outward and leaves it open.

1675
01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:09.995
You can see in there these

1676
01:04:09.995 --> 01:04:13.092
river stone-looking pieces of rock

1677
01:04:13.092 --> 01:04:15.972
that are faintly blue and they almost look

1678
01:04:15.972 --> 01:04:20.900
somewhat translucent, like a polished quartz crystal,

1679
01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.963
semi-opaque, semi-transparent,

1680
01:04:22.963 --> 01:04:24.777
and they're a little soft,

1681
01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:27.141
she pulls one out and sets it down and it like,

1682
01:04:27.141 --> 01:04:29.182
it seems to have a little give to it as its placed.

1683
01:04:29.182 --> 01:04:30.470
SAM: Like a mochi ball?

1684
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:33.318
MATT: Kind of, I guess you could say.

1685
01:04:33.318 --> 01:04:34.776
TALIESIN: That's interesting.

1686
01:04:34.776 --> 01:04:36.719
SAM: What does it do, what does it do?

1687
01:04:36.719 --> 01:04:38.382
MATT: "I have to go check, I'll be right back."

1688
01:04:38.382 --> 01:04:40.510
LAURA: Why doesn't she know these things?

1689
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.193
SAM: Why don't you bring the books to the front?

1690
01:04:42.193 --> 01:04:44.033
All right, it's fine.

1691
01:04:44.033 --> 01:04:45.467
TRAVIS: You know what you should do, Nott?

1692
01:04:45.467 --> 01:04:47.861
You should touch it and see what happens.

1693
01:04:47.861 --> 01:04:49.018
SAM: I'll touch it.

1694
01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:52.183
MATT: As your hand gets close, you hear (hissing)

1695
01:04:52.183 --> 01:04:54.398
from both of the imps up there.

1696
01:04:54.398 --> 01:04:56.215
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1697
01:04:56.215 --> 01:04:57.347
LAURA: I guess it's good you didn't try

1698
01:04:57.347 --> 01:04:58.981
to steal all the mithral, hm?

1699
01:04:58.981 --> 01:05:01.189
MATT: She returns.
SAM: We could kill them very quickly.

1700
01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:03.366
MATT: "These are echo stones."

1701
01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:04.619
TALIESIN and LAURA: Echo stones?

1702
01:05:04.619 --> 01:05:06.160
MATT: "Yes. Watch."

1703
01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.550
She takes it and squeezes it in her hand

1704
01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:10.924
and you watch it glows faintly, and she goes,

1705
01:05:10.924 --> 01:05:12.265
"It's useful.

1706
01:05:12.265 --> 01:05:15.233
"Hopefully, depending on the situation,"

1707
01:05:15.233 --> 01:05:16.986
and then releases it, and tosses it

1708
01:05:16.986 --> 01:05:18.744
about five feet behind you. (clicks)

1709
01:05:18.744 --> 01:05:20.719
It makes almost no sound as it hits the ground.

1710
01:05:20.719 --> 01:05:21.552
MARISHA: It's a talk back.

1711
01:05:21.552 --> 01:05:22.885
MATT: And that's it.

1712
01:05:24.137 --> 01:05:25.500
SAM: But what does it...

1713
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:29.986
I go over and wave my hand over it, touch it.

1714
01:05:29.986 --> 01:05:31.770
MATT: It's kind of squishy.

1715
01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:32.836
SAM: Jump over it.

1716
01:05:32.836 --> 01:05:33.993
MATT: You leap over it.

1717
01:05:33.993 --> 01:05:35.025
TRAVIS: Rather disappointing.

1718
01:05:35.025 --> 01:05:37.121
LAURA: I'm going to pick it up and squeeze it in my hand.

1719
01:05:37.121 --> 01:05:39.024
MATT: As you go and pick it up, it suddenly says

1720
01:05:39.024 --> 01:05:42.928
the exact phrase in the exact voice she left into it.

1721
01:05:42.928 --> 01:05:43.896
SAM: Interesting.

1722
01:05:43.896 --> 01:05:46.938
LAURA: It's a way to leave messages for each other or?

1723
01:05:46.938 --> 01:05:48.611
TRAVIS: Or distraction, perhaps?

1724
01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.216
MATT: "It'll repeat it over time."

1725
01:05:51.216 --> 01:05:54.799
Let me pull the exact object up here.

1726
01:05:57.167 --> 01:05:58.000
SAM: That's pretty cool.

1727
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.150
I don't know how we would use it, but

1728
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:01.188
we could come up with something.

1729
01:06:01.188 --> 01:06:02.105
MARISHA: It's like the whiteboard on--

1730
01:06:02.105 --> 01:06:04.701
MATT: "It repeats it ever five minutes."

1731
01:06:04.701 --> 01:06:05.589
LAURA: On its own?

1732
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:08.464
MATT: "On its own until its been squeezed once more

1733
01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:12.780
"and no longer in continuing its

1734
01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.297
"repetition."

1735
01:06:14.297 --> 01:06:17.820
LAURA: Oh, it's a diversion.

1736
01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:18.987
TRAVIS: That's cool.

1737
01:06:19.846 --> 01:06:20.859
MATT: There are five of them in the box,

1738
01:06:20.859 --> 01:06:23.036
or four in the box, now and the one that's,

1739
01:06:23.036 --> 01:06:24.114
"Oh, if you wouldn't mind, please."

1740
01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:25.609
LAURA: Oh, sorry, I was chewing on it a little bit,

1741
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:26.830
it's probably okay, though.

1742
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:29.879
TRAVIS: How much would one of those run?

1743
01:06:29.879 --> 01:06:33.414
MATT: "Oh, each of these runs about 100 gold pieces.

1744
01:06:33.414 --> 01:06:37.234
"You could say 450 for the lot if you're interested."

1745
01:06:37.234 --> 01:06:40.038
TRAVIS: Could be useful when infiltrating.

1746
01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:44.838
LIAM: May I ask, would you mind if I inspected your

1747
01:06:44.838 --> 01:06:46.913
residuum?

1748
01:06:48.316 --> 01:06:49.365
MATT: "By all means,"

1749
01:06:49.365 --> 01:06:50.858
and slides it forward on the table.

1750
01:06:50.858 --> 01:06:52.775
LAURA: The refined residuum?

1751
01:06:57.196 --> 01:07:01.443
MATT: It's a familiar color and texture to you.

1752
01:07:01.443 --> 01:07:04.518
TALIESIN: What?!
LAURA: (gasps)

1753
01:07:04.518 --> 01:07:07.757
That's what the crystals were!

1754
01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:08.773
SAM: What crystals?

1755
01:07:08.773 --> 01:07:10.074
LAURA: That he had to shove into his arm!

1756
01:07:10.074 --> 01:07:11.666
SAM: Oh shit!

1757
01:07:11.666 --> 01:07:12.499
MARISHA: That makes sense.

1758
01:07:12.499 --> 01:07:14.570
LAURA: We're not saying that out loud, don't worry.

1759
01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:16.656
SAM: I'm saying it out loud! No.

1760
01:07:16.656 --> 01:07:18.629
(laughter)

1761
01:07:18.629 --> 01:07:19.483
LIAM: Thank you.

1762
01:07:19.483 --> 01:07:20.316
LAURA: (sighs)

1763
01:07:20.316 --> 01:07:21.316
MATT: "Of course.

1764
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:24.996
"So.

1765
01:07:24.996 --> 01:07:27.003
"If you wish for these stones,

1766
01:07:27.003 --> 01:07:29.576
"one, two, or the lot, whatever you'd like to purchase."

1767
01:07:29.576 --> 01:07:30.660
LAURA: How much--

1768
01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:35.454
TALIESIN: Before we do, is there anything else that I saw

1769
01:07:35.454 --> 01:07:37.194
popping up?

1770
01:07:37.194 --> 01:07:38.721
MATT: She pulls over and you can see

1771
01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:43.277
a small vial, it has swirling, a dull,

1772
01:07:43.277 --> 01:07:45.720
let me look at the coloration on this one here.

1773
01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.576
TALIESIN: Yep.

1774
01:07:46.576 --> 01:07:48.826
SAM: You've got all the items.

1775
01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:53.686
MATT: This one has a pinkish-purple tint to it.

1776
01:07:53.686 --> 01:07:54.519
TALIESIN: Oh, that's cool.

1777
01:07:54.519 --> 01:07:56.490
MATT: And goes like,

1778
01:07:56.490 --> 01:08:00.582
"This in particular is an elixir that can purify the body

1779
01:08:00.582 --> 01:08:03.907
"of any sort of ailments, I believe so,"

1780
01:08:03.907 --> 01:08:05.198
and she grabs it and looks underneath

1781
01:08:05.198 --> 01:08:06.771
and puts the little tag.

1782
01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:09.162
"That is exactly what it is."

1783
01:08:09.162 --> 01:08:10.854
TALIESIN: That labeling system's a really good idea,

1784
01:08:10.854 --> 01:08:12.397
that's actually--
MATT: "It's occasionally helpful."

1785
01:08:12.397 --> 01:08:13.655
LAURA: You should maybe write what it does

1786
01:08:13.655 --> 01:08:17.448
on the outside of the box, so you don't have to--

1787
01:08:17.448 --> 01:08:19.169
MATT: "Then it just makes it that much easier

1788
01:08:19.169 --> 01:08:22.042
"for it to be pilfered by wandering eyes."

1789
01:08:22.042 --> 01:08:23.554
LAURA: This is true.

1790
01:08:23.554 --> 01:08:24.807
TALIESIN: What does... nevermind.

1791
01:08:24.807 --> 01:08:27.558
MATT: "Don't doubt my techniques, I don't doubt yours."

1792
01:08:27.558 --> 01:08:28.962
MICA: See, she's mean!

1793
01:08:28.962 --> 01:08:30.719
SAM: She's kind of abrasive.

1794
01:08:30.719 --> 01:08:33.800
TALIESIN: Was there anything else that was glowing up

1795
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.245
that like I might have picked?

1796
01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:38.421
MATT: There was the stones, there was the vial,

1797
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:41.188
and I'll say there is probably one--

1798
01:08:41.188 --> 01:08:42.111
TALIESIN: One more.

1799
01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:43.666
I won't push any further past this one.

1800
01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:44.568
MATT: Okay, okay.

1801
01:08:44.568 --> 01:08:46.423
(laughs)

1802
01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:47.974
TALIESIN: Got to do three.

1803
01:08:47.974 --> 01:08:49.784
MATT: Brings it over and pulls up

1804
01:08:49.784 --> 01:08:52.447
a small jewelry box, about that big.

1805
01:08:52.447 --> 01:08:53.851
Pulls it up out of a larger container,

1806
01:08:53.851 --> 01:08:56.754
rummaging through, lifts it and opens it up,

1807
01:08:56.754 --> 01:08:59.008
looks for the little tag on the side and goes,

1808
01:08:59.008 --> 01:09:02.736
"Yes, this is a ring that's enchanted.

1809
01:09:02.736 --> 01:09:05.667
"A simple application with the intent of just

1810
01:09:05.667 --> 01:09:09.984
"enabling a minor bit of passive protection

1811
01:09:09.984 --> 01:09:13.297
"to an individual who, you know,

1812
01:09:13.297 --> 01:09:15.332
"wishes to survive in a very harsh world."

1813
01:09:15.332 --> 01:09:19.778
SAM: Fjord, do you think you could use one of those?

1814
01:09:19.778 --> 01:09:23.278
LAURA: Who has on a ring of protection already?

1815
01:09:24.352 --> 01:09:28.769
TRAVIS: How much for that useful ring you have there?

1816
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:31.477
MARISHA: They're expensive.

1817
01:09:33.462 --> 01:09:36.879
MATT: "Ah, let's see, that would run you about

1818
01:09:36.879 --> 01:09:40.257
"3000 gold pieces for that."

1819
01:09:40.257 --> 01:09:44.125
TRAVIS: Right, what is that, a plus two to AC or plus one?

1820
01:09:44.125 --> 01:09:47.866
MATT: Plus one to AC and saving throws.

1821
01:09:47.866 --> 01:09:50.666
MICA: Do you need protection, Mr. Green Man?

1822
01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:51.564
LAURA: His name is Fjord.

1823
01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:53.463
MICA: Fjord, do you need protection, Fjord?

1824
01:09:53.463 --> 01:09:54.811
TRAVIS: Uh, yes.

1825
01:09:54.811 --> 01:09:56.335
MICA: I can protect you.

1826
01:09:56.335 --> 01:09:57.299
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1827
01:09:57.299 --> 01:09:59.366
LAURA: We never told her our names.
MARISHA: We didn't.

1828
01:09:59.366 --> 01:10:01.672
MICA: No, but you guys seem nice so I just trusted you.

1829
01:10:01.672 --> 01:10:02.745
SAM: Wow!

1830
01:10:02.745 --> 01:10:03.864
You're so nice.

1831
01:10:03.864 --> 01:10:08.710
You know, Ava, Reani here tells us so much about you

1832
01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.362
and about how wonderful you are to work with

1833
01:10:11.362 --> 01:10:14.355
and how kind you are to her and--

1834
01:10:14.355 --> 01:10:15.492
MICA: That's not what I said.

1835
01:10:15.492 --> 01:10:18.092
SAM: Oh, well, I was trying to help out with your

1836
01:10:18.092 --> 01:10:20.961
relationship a little bit.
MICA: No, it's okay.

1837
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:23.941
MATT: "We're very aware of our relationship.

1838
01:10:23.941 --> 01:10:26.328
"Thank you for whatever you're attempting,

1839
01:10:26.328 --> 01:10:28.551
"but it's unnecessary."

1840
01:10:28.551 --> 01:10:30.994
MICA: I'm guessing you still don't want a flower crown?

1841
01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:33.975
MATT: "I will destroy you."

1842
01:10:33.975 --> 01:10:37.487
TRAVIS: Ava, could I offer you 850 gold

1843
01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:39.258
for all of the mithral that you have

1844
01:10:39.258 --> 01:10:42.258
and one of those little echo stones?

1845
01:10:44.971 --> 01:10:48.030
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1846
01:10:49.663 --> 01:10:51.730
TRAVIS: 16.
MATT: 16.

1847
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:54.880
"Deal."

1848
01:10:56.666 --> 01:11:00.473
Shuffles the pile of various mithral knickknacks

1849
01:11:00.473 --> 01:11:04.918
and sets one of the stones amongst the pile.

1850
01:11:04.918 --> 01:11:06.839
Closes the box.

1851
01:11:06.839 --> 01:11:08.167
TALIESIN: We have some business to take care of

1852
01:11:08.167 --> 01:11:09.563
and then once we're finished with it,

1853
01:11:09.563 --> 01:11:11.130
we'll be back to have our conversation,

1854
01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:13.608
perhaps about the residuum.

1855
01:11:13.608 --> 01:11:18.331
MATT: "Well, if you manage to return this object I seek,

1856
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:22.522
"then I'm very excited of this transaction."

1857
01:11:22.522 --> 01:11:23.693
TALIESIN: I am excited as well,

1858
01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:26.380
I think this may work out well for everybody involved.

1859
01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:29.896
MATT: "I'm curious, and just because I'm a curious creature,

1860
01:11:29.896 --> 01:11:33.767
"what is your intent with this refined residuum?"

1861
01:11:35.674 --> 01:11:39.332
TALIESIN: I am on a mission for the Wildmother.

1862
01:11:39.332 --> 01:11:43.170
She asked me to procure this and so I shall.

1863
01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:45.378
MATT: "Hm.

1864
01:11:45.378 --> 01:11:46.961
"Sure.

1865
01:11:46.961 --> 01:11:48.326
"Very well.

1866
01:11:48.326 --> 01:11:49.579
"Anything else you require?"

1867
01:11:49.579 --> 01:11:51.161
TRAVIS: Did you want the residuum?

1868
01:11:51.161 --> 01:11:53.242
TALIESIN: We'll be back.

1869
01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:54.665
I do, but--

1870
01:11:54.665 --> 01:11:55.683
LIAM: One step at a time, right?

1871
01:11:55.683 --> 01:11:56.870
TALIESIN: One step at a time.

1872
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:58.449
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

1873
01:11:58.449 --> 01:12:01.366
LIAM: You don't deal in spells, do you?

1874
01:12:02.655 --> 01:12:05.645
MATT: "No, unfortunately the Steeple

1875
01:12:05.645 --> 01:12:08.065
"tends to run most of that business."

1876
01:12:08.065 --> 01:12:10.367
LIAM: Of course.

1877
01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:13.326
MARISHA: Is that where we're going next?

1878
01:12:13.326 --> 01:12:16.689
Did I notice anything suspicious while watching outside?

1879
01:12:16.689 --> 01:12:17.588
MATT: Watching outside,

1880
01:12:17.588 --> 01:12:21.097
nothing caught your attention specifically.

1881
01:12:21.097 --> 01:12:25.257
This is out of the way, and it's so strange,

1882
01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:27.178
doesn't seem like a lot of people tend to enjoy

1883
01:12:27.178 --> 01:12:31.216
coming through just to check in on you.

1884
01:12:31.216 --> 01:12:34.321
TRAVIS: I put the mithral in the bag of holding

1885
01:12:34.321 --> 01:12:37.404
and I throw the echo stone to Jester.

1886
01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:40.274
TALIESIN: Let's double-check that this is enough mithral

1887
01:12:40.274 --> 01:12:43.013
and then the right--
TRAVIS: Sure.

1888
01:12:43.013 --> 01:12:45.093
TALIESIN: If we can just maybe keep it in the box

1889
01:12:45.093 --> 01:12:48.042
and just have the box get hit, or I don't know.

1890
01:12:48.042 --> 01:12:50.945
TRAVIS: After we let them get to the archive.

1891
01:12:50.945 --> 01:12:52.502
TALIESIN: Yeah, of course.

1892
01:12:52.502 --> 01:12:53.593
TRAVIS: Yes.

1893
01:12:53.593 --> 01:12:54.529
LAURA: That would suck if we had to hold up

1894
01:12:54.529 --> 01:12:56.696
every single item one by one.

1895
01:12:57.545 --> 01:12:58.795
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1896
01:13:00.092 --> 01:13:03.275
TRAVIS: Breathe here, breathe here, breathe here.

1897
01:13:03.275 --> 01:13:04.875
(frost breath)

1898
01:13:04.875 --> 01:13:06.173
(laughter)

1899
01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:08.006
TALIESIN: Like licking stamps.

1900
01:13:09.098 --> 01:13:12.337
SAM: Before we leave, Ms. Ava,

1901
01:13:12.337 --> 01:13:17.192
do you know what iceflex are and do you have any of it?

1902
01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:20.519
MATT: "I haven't the foggiest idea what that is.

1903
01:13:20.519 --> 01:13:21.613
"Sorry."

1904
01:13:21.613 --> 01:13:25.898
SAM: Can you check, can you check?

1905
01:13:25.898 --> 01:13:27.414
MATT: "Sure."

1906
01:13:27.414 --> 01:13:30.421
She turns around and goes off.

1907
01:13:30.421 --> 01:13:31.790
SAM: Should we just kill the imps and steal everything?

1908
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:33.656
LAURA: I don't think we should kill the imps.

1909
01:13:33.656 --> 01:13:35.929
TALIESIN: I think that would go very badly.

1910
01:13:35.929 --> 01:13:36.968
SAM: They're little!

1911
01:13:36.968 --> 01:13:38.259
MICA: I'll have to kill you.

1912
01:13:38.259 --> 01:13:39.480
SAM: Oh, that's right!

1913
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.918
TRAVIS: How can you forget--

1914
01:13:40.918 --> 01:13:41.859
LAURA: Hey, imps!

1915
01:13:41.859 --> 01:13:44.371
TRAVIS: -- great security is right here.

1916
01:13:44.371 --> 01:13:45.686
LIAM: They've also just been listening

1917
01:13:45.686 --> 01:13:46.960
to us have this entire conversation.

1918
01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.911
SAM: They can't speak Common.
LAURA: They can!

1919
01:13:48.911 --> 01:13:49.908
MICA: Then also if you kill them,

1920
01:13:49.908 --> 01:13:51.353
then maybe she'll kick me out of my house

1921
01:13:51.353 --> 01:13:52.607
and then where am I supposed to go?

1922
01:13:52.607 --> 01:13:53.502
LAURA: Did she give you your house?

1923
01:13:53.502 --> 01:13:56.373
MICA: She's the reason I have it, I did a lot of trading,

1924
01:13:56.373 --> 01:13:57.908
it was a long story, and I kind of don't

1925
01:13:57.908 --> 01:14:00.246
want to be homeless, you guys.

1926
01:14:00.246 --> 01:14:03.350
TRAVIS: Good context, yes!

1927
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:06.032
Not stealing from her!

1928
01:14:06.032 --> 01:14:09.514
MICA: Then once again, I'd have to kill you.

1929
01:14:09.514 --> 01:14:10.347
SAM: All right.

1930
01:14:10.347 --> 01:14:11.235
MICA: And you seem so nice.

1931
01:14:11.235 --> 01:14:13.947
TALIESIN: I assure you they can speak Common.

1932
01:14:13.947 --> 01:14:14.780
Right?

1933
01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.943
LAURA: They can.

1934
01:14:15.943 --> 01:14:17.128
TRAVIS: We hate to die.
MATT: "Yes."

1935
01:14:17.128 --> 01:14:18.486
TALIESIN: Thank you.
LAURA: Yeah.

1936
01:14:18.486 --> 01:14:20.978
You guys are real cute.
SAM: They just know a couple of phrases--

1937
01:14:20.978 --> 01:14:22.464
MARISHA: Not today.

1938
01:14:22.464 --> 01:14:24.331
SAM: Oh, see!

1939
01:14:26.413 --> 01:14:28.246
LAURA: Yes, I am very cute!

1940
01:14:29.295 --> 01:14:31.692
MATT: "No."
TRAVIS: Ava's still in the back?

1941
01:14:31.692 --> 01:14:34.186
SAM: Ava, did you find anything?

1942
01:14:34.186 --> 01:14:36.086
MATT: Comes by a moment later.

1943
01:14:36.086 --> 01:14:37.688
"No iceflex, sorry, fresh out."

1944
01:14:37.688 --> 01:14:39.551
SAM and LAURA: All right.

1945
01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:42.215
TRAVIS: All right, thank you, we'll be returning,

1946
01:14:42.215 --> 01:14:44.411
hopefully with your item.

1947
01:14:44.411 --> 01:14:46.650
MATT: "Yes, please. I'd love that."

1948
01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:47.826
TALIESIN: Exciting.

1949
01:14:47.826 --> 01:14:51.553
MATT: "Ta-ta! Be careful."

1950
01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:53.805
TRAVIS: Did you see anything while we were inside?

1951
01:14:53.805 --> 01:14:55.305
MARISHA: Uh, no.

1952
01:14:56.755 --> 01:15:00.200
Turns out people aren't that interested or

1953
01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.784
they're pretty normal.

1954
01:15:02.784 --> 01:15:04.516
How'd it go with you?
LIAM: You sound slightly disappointed.

1955
01:15:04.516 --> 01:15:05.681
MARISHA: Ah, yeah.

1956
01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:06.578
SAM: We got some stuff.

1957
01:15:06.578 --> 01:15:08.919
MARISHA: I waited for 30 minutes and nothing happened.

1958
01:15:08.919 --> 01:15:11.596
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got a box of mithral and--

1959
01:15:11.596 --> 01:15:13.162
LAURA: Ooh!
MARISHA: Can I see?

1960
01:15:13.162 --> 01:15:14.736
TRAVIS: It's in the-- oh, I have the Bag of Holding,

1961
01:15:14.736 --> 01:15:16.262
Yes.

1962
01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:17.810
I take out the box.

1963
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:20.548
There's a teacup and a bunch of other fragments of shit.

1964
01:15:20.548 --> 01:15:23.038
MARISHA: That little soldier guy is cool.

1965
01:15:23.038 --> 01:15:23.871
TRAVIS: Yes.

1966
01:15:23.871 --> 01:15:24.983
MARISHA: Can I hold the soldier guy?

1967
01:15:24.983 --> 01:15:26.862
LIAM: That is a game piece.
TRAVIS: Sure.

1968
01:15:26.862 --> 01:15:29.794
MICA: Mr. Coat Man, did you want to go see books?

1969
01:15:29.794 --> 01:15:31.737
LIAM: Oh...
TRAVIS: ♪ Mr. Coat Man! ♪

1970
01:15:31.737 --> 01:15:33.146
LIAM: The answer to that is always yes.

1971
01:15:33.146 --> 01:15:35.716
MARISHA: My name is Beauregard, by the way.

1972
01:15:35.716 --> 01:15:36.725
MICA: Hi, Beauregard!

1973
01:15:36.725 --> 01:15:37.963
MARISHA: Yeah, good to meet you.

1974
01:15:37.963 --> 01:15:39.061
MICA: Nice to meet you.

1975
01:15:39.061 --> 01:15:39.977
MARISHA: Don't kill us.

1976
01:15:39.977 --> 01:15:40.810
LIAM: Let's all--
MICA: I won't!

1977
01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:41.643
Don't be bad.

1978
01:15:41.643 --> 01:15:42.759
TALIESIN: And that's Caleb.

1979
01:15:42.759 --> 01:15:43.592
Caleb, Coat Man.

1980
01:15:43.592 --> 01:15:46.819
LIAM: Thank you, Caleb "Coat Man" Widogast.

1981
01:15:46.819 --> 01:15:48.210
SAM: I'm Nott the Brave.

1982
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.467
MICA: Nott the Brave.

1983
01:15:49.467 --> 01:15:51.795
And you're Jester. You whispered it to me.

1984
01:15:51.795 --> 01:15:54.151
TALIESIN: Caduceus Pink Guy, apparently.

1985
01:15:54.151 --> 01:15:55.118
MICA: Can I call you Pinky?

1986
01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:56.096
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1987
01:15:56.096 --> 01:15:56.929
MICA: Hi, Pinky.
TALIESIN: Hi.

1988
01:15:56.929 --> 01:15:58.437
TRAVIS: Caduceus Pink Eye?

1989
01:15:58.437 --> 01:16:00.751
(laughter)

1990
01:16:00.751 --> 01:16:01.826
MICA: So we have--

1991
01:16:01.826 --> 01:16:03.654
LAURA: Caduceus plays with his poop!

1992
01:16:03.654 --> 01:16:06.333
(laughter)

1993
01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:08.587
MARISHA: The lead singer of a ska band.

1994
01:16:08.587 --> 01:16:09.476
Caduceus Pink Eye.

1995
01:16:09.476 --> 01:16:11.295
TALIESIN: No, too far, too far.

1996
01:16:11.295 --> 01:16:13.979
There's a line on this table and you fucking crossed it.

1997
01:16:13.979 --> 01:16:14.906
MICA: Ska is the line?

1998
01:16:14.906 --> 01:16:18.800
TALIESIN: Ska is, by gods, always the line.

1999
01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.580
SAM: He's the drummer for Yasha and Orphans.

2000
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.130
(laughter and groaning)

2001
01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:25.897
LIAM: I cast Conjunctivitis.

2002
01:16:25.897 --> 01:16:27.870
(laughter)

2003
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:29.495
MATT: It's a 6th-level spell. You're not there yet.

2004
01:16:29.495 --> 01:16:30.570
TALIESIN: Too much of a day.

2005
01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:32.653
(laughter)

2006
01:16:32.653 --> 01:16:36.526
MICA: So we have Fjord Green Man, Beauregard,

2007
01:16:36.526 --> 01:16:39.118
Caleb Coat Man, Nott the Brave,

2008
01:16:39.118 --> 01:16:41.318
Jester, and Pinky.

2009
01:16:42.942 --> 01:16:43.775
SAM: And Reani.

2010
01:16:43.775 --> 01:16:44.608
MICA: And Reani. That's me.

2011
01:16:44.608 --> 01:16:45.520
SAM: Is Reani short for anything?

2012
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.939
MICA: Yeah, Reanminere.

2013
01:16:46.939 --> 01:16:47.772
LAURA: Oh, that's beautiful!

2014
01:16:47.772 --> 01:16:48.605
MICA: Thank you!

2015
01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:49.561
SAM: Reanminere is beautiful!

2016
01:16:49.561 --> 01:16:51.176
MICA: But it takes a lot of people a long time to learn that

2017
01:16:51.176 --> 01:16:52.355
so it's Reani.

2018
01:16:52.355 --> 01:16:54.905
ALL: Reanminere.

2019
01:16:56.065 --> 01:16:57.428
LAURA: That's beautiful.

2020
01:16:57.428 --> 01:16:59.489
Have you ever heard of the Ruby of the Sea?

2021
01:16:59.489 --> 01:17:01.922
MICA: Actually I have. I've met her once!

2022
01:17:01.922 --> 01:17:03.626
LAURA: You have?
MICA: Yeah!

2023
01:17:03.626 --> 01:17:05.398
LAURA: That's my mom!

2024
01:17:05.398 --> 01:17:07.307
MICA: I love your mom!

2025
01:17:07.307 --> 01:17:08.595
LAURA: I know, she's so great, right?

2026
01:17:08.595 --> 01:17:09.470
MICA: She's so pretty.

2027
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.796
LAURA: Oh my god, did you hear her perform?

2028
01:17:10.796 --> 01:17:11.848
MICA: Yes.

2029
01:17:11.848 --> 01:17:13.442
LAURA: When were you there?

2030
01:17:13.442 --> 01:17:15.519
MICA: When I was a kid, but

2031
01:17:15.519 --> 01:17:18.285
I know I wasn't supposed to be there, but

2032
01:17:18.285 --> 01:17:19.898
I went and I wanted to visit your mom

2033
01:17:19.898 --> 01:17:20.786
because I followed Landon

2034
01:17:20.786 --> 01:17:22.960
because my dad wanted to go see her performance.

2035
01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.391
So I went behind and then I was like, whoa!

2036
01:17:24.391 --> 01:17:26.185
She's so pretty. I wanted to be her when I grew up.

2037
01:17:26.185 --> 01:17:27.176
LAURA: How old were you?

2038
01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:28.009
MICA: I was five.

2039
01:17:28.009 --> 01:17:30.175
LAURA: Oh, that was before I was born probably.

2040
01:17:30.175 --> 01:17:31.008
MICA: Aww.

2041
01:17:31.008 --> 01:17:32.098
LIAM: I grab Beauregard by the shoulder and say,

2042
01:17:32.098 --> 01:17:33.269
come on, we're going to the archive.

2043
01:17:33.269 --> 01:17:35.862
MARISHA: Yes, thank you.
MATT: (laughs)

2044
01:17:35.862 --> 01:17:37.013
Just the two of you?

2045
01:17:37.013 --> 01:17:38.825
SAM: We're all going.
MARISHA: We're going to--

2046
01:17:38.825 --> 01:17:39.658
LIAM: Catch up.

2047
01:17:39.658 --> 01:17:41.066
MARISHA: (laughs)

2048
01:17:41.066 --> 01:17:43.280
LAURA: We go running after them being very noisy.

2049
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.113
TRAVIS: We should go.

2050
01:17:44.113 --> 01:17:45.810
MATT: All right, you guys step ahead

2051
01:17:45.810 --> 01:17:48.296
and with a little bit of guidance from Reani

2052
01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:51.262
and your general streetwise awareness,

2053
01:17:51.262 --> 01:17:54.566
you eventually find your way towards the Vellum Steeple,

2054
01:17:54.566 --> 01:17:56.162
but you see--
MARISHA: Hey, DM question?

2055
01:17:56.162 --> 01:17:56.995
MATT: Yes?

2056
01:17:56.995 --> 01:17:59.782
MARISHA: Okay, you mentioned before that this is primarily

2057
01:17:59.782 --> 01:18:03.095
dwarven and elven in terms of population?

2058
01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:03.928
MATT: Correct.

2059
01:18:03.928 --> 01:18:07.906
MARISHA: We're out of Xhorhas, of Xhorhasian borders?

2060
01:18:07.906 --> 01:18:12.090
MATT: Yes, you guys are outside of the elements of the war.

2061
01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:14.037
You are far north of the Empire.

2062
01:18:14.037 --> 01:18:16.933
TRAVIS: North and west, or just straight-up north?

2063
01:18:16.933 --> 01:18:19.284
MATT: It's more north of the Empire,

2064
01:18:19.284 --> 01:18:21.762
and northwest of Xhorhas.

2065
01:18:21.762 --> 01:18:22.766
TRAVIS: Cool.

2066
01:18:22.766 --> 01:18:23.882
MARISHA: Okay.

2067
01:18:23.882 --> 01:18:27.172
SAM: Oh, northwest of Xhorhas, got it.

2068
01:18:27.172 --> 01:18:28.602
TRAVIS: All right.
MATT: Make everybody look.

2069
01:18:28.602 --> 01:18:30.759
TRAVIS: There's a map, point with a finger.

2070
01:18:30.759 --> 01:18:31.952
SAM: Well, that's just the whole--

2071
01:18:31.952 --> 01:18:33.052
TALIESIN: Right there, right smack dab.

2072
01:18:33.052 --> 01:18:34.260
(tapping)
TRAVIS: Ow!

2073
01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:37.568
(laughter)

2074
01:18:39.732 --> 01:18:40.862
LAURA: That was pretty stupid.

2075
01:18:40.862 --> 01:18:43.112
(laughter)

2076
01:18:44.135 --> 01:18:46.010
TRAVIS: (cracking)

2077
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:48.434
TALIESIN: That was gross.

2078
01:18:48.434 --> 01:18:49.297
SAM: Off to the Steeple.

2079
01:18:49.297 --> 01:18:50.317
MATT: Indeed.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2080
01:18:50.317 --> 01:18:54.430
MATT: You come upon the grand, curving tower of blue marble

2081
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:56.127
that glitters as it ascends,

2082
01:18:56.127 --> 01:18:58.948
blending into the rock above it.

2083
01:18:58.948 --> 01:19:02.776
The exterior of it seems to reveal the presence

2084
01:19:02.776 --> 01:19:05.799
of very wide, cavernous halls on the inside.

2085
01:19:05.799 --> 01:19:09.042
You can see what looks to be,

2086
01:19:09.042 --> 01:19:11.521
very limited color palette on stained glass

2087
01:19:11.521 --> 01:19:14.561
that sits primarily between red and yellow

2088
01:19:14.561 --> 01:19:17.186
to be complementary to the

2089
01:19:17.186 --> 01:19:20.252
mostly blue structure itself.

2090
01:19:20.252 --> 01:19:24.309
The outside of it looks to have a

2091
01:19:24.309 --> 01:19:28.868
colorless courtyard of bushes that have a gray tint,

2092
01:19:28.868 --> 01:19:31.470
the leaves looking to be heavily textured.

2093
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:33.337
This is a unique form of subterranean plant life

2094
01:19:33.337 --> 01:19:36.063
that you haven't really come across.

2095
01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:39.827
It's a makeshift garden on the outside

2096
01:19:39.827 --> 01:19:44.278
of an odd type of lightless plant life.

2097
01:19:44.278 --> 01:19:46.713
You saw elements of this, actually,

2098
01:19:46.713 --> 01:19:49.984
underneath in the Shadowshire of Rosohna,

2099
01:19:49.984 --> 01:19:53.974
usually used in less decorative and more

2100
01:19:53.974 --> 01:19:57.890
an element of the subterranean planting process and farming

2101
01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:00.539
as a separator to various fields.

2102
01:20:00.539 --> 01:20:03.968
But here it's given a slightly beautiful

2103
01:20:03.968 --> 01:20:07.557
manicured presence on the exterior of the Steeple.

2104
01:20:07.557 --> 01:20:10.374
You can see the door is open.

2105
01:20:10.374 --> 01:20:12.740
There is curved archway

2106
01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:16.774
and a very tall door, probably 10-foot to the top,

2107
01:20:16.774 --> 01:20:19.115
and on the inside it's warmly lit,

2108
01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:21.231
kind of an orange--
(phone chime)

2109
01:20:21.231 --> 01:20:22.779
MATT: --and you hear a chime as you approach.

2110
01:20:22.779 --> 01:20:24.429
(laughter)

2111
01:20:24.429 --> 01:20:26.687
MARISHA: Oh, they have a door chime.

2112
01:20:26.687 --> 01:20:28.082
TALIESIN: Oh good. Everybody needs one.

2113
01:20:28.082 --> 01:20:32.348
MATT: They have a lucky cat in there.

2114
01:20:32.348 --> 01:20:34.269
As you step and approach,

2115
01:20:34.269 --> 01:20:37.084
you can see there are a few figures that walk out.

2116
01:20:37.084 --> 01:20:40.357
They look to be well-dressed noble folk.

2117
01:20:40.357 --> 01:20:44.364
You see a pair of elves, a male and female,

2118
01:20:44.364 --> 01:20:46.805
walking arm-in-arm, watch you as you pass

2119
01:20:46.805 --> 01:20:49.839
and continue out into the city and as you step inside,

2120
01:20:49.839 --> 01:20:53.728
you can see a long, curved table

2121
01:20:53.728 --> 01:20:55.838
with two individuals at the front.

2122
01:20:55.838 --> 01:20:59.463
You see a young,

2123
01:20:59.463 --> 01:21:02.204
elven man

2124
01:21:02.204 --> 01:21:04.514
in cream-colored robes

2125
01:21:04.514 --> 01:21:07.979
with a sash of golden burgundy,

2126
01:21:07.979 --> 01:21:10.979
that has a cool stitched pattern throughout it,

2127
01:21:10.979 --> 01:21:12.525
and he is sitting there

2128
01:21:12.525 --> 01:21:15.523
looking bored out of his fucking mind.

2129
01:21:15.523 --> 01:21:17.675
To the left of him, you can see

2130
01:21:17.675 --> 01:21:21.972
a dwarf woman, middle aged or so,

2131
01:21:21.972 --> 01:21:26.025
who has a very thick pair of spectacles on

2132
01:21:26.025 --> 01:21:30.649
and is currently in the process of sketching

2133
01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:34.137
or writing in a tome of some kind on the table.

2134
01:21:34.137 --> 01:21:35.873
As you step into the chamber,

2135
01:21:35.873 --> 01:21:40.063
the bored elf gentleman, without even looking up, goes,

2136
01:21:40.063 --> 01:21:41.926
"Can I help you?"

2137
01:21:41.926 --> 01:21:44.534
LIAM: Yeah, good afternoon.

2138
01:21:44.534 --> 01:21:46.496
New to town and we have heard great things

2139
01:21:46.496 --> 01:21:48.554
about the Archive,

2140
01:21:48.554 --> 01:21:51.704
wanted to inquire as to the--

2141
01:21:51.704 --> 01:21:54.689
MATT: "Are you here to meet with the Woodset Auditors?"

2142
01:21:54.689 --> 01:21:57.267
LIAM: The Woodset Auditors?

2143
01:21:57.267 --> 01:22:00.976
MATT: "You are not here to meet with the Woodset Auditors."

2144
01:22:00.976 --> 01:22:02.570
TALIESIN: They're otters?

2145
01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:04.914
LAURA: (laughs)

2146
01:22:04.914 --> 01:22:06.484
MATT: "Otters would be interesting."

2147
01:22:06.484 --> 01:22:07.317
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2148
01:22:08.413 --> 01:22:09.596
MATT: "Can I help you?"

2149
01:22:09.596 --> 01:22:13.095
He finally looks up and starts making eye contact.

2150
01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:15.595
LIAM: We hear you have some books.

2151
01:22:16.911 --> 01:22:20.201
Are they open to the public? Is there any method by which

2152
01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:23.303
visitors to the city may peruse your shelves?

2153
01:22:23.303 --> 01:22:24.526
MATT: "No.

2154
01:22:24.526 --> 01:22:26.104
"You can request a book

2155
01:22:26.104 --> 01:22:28.919
"and it will be brought to you under supervision."

2156
01:22:28.919 --> 01:22:29.802
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

2157
01:22:29.802 --> 01:22:31.903
MATT: "But this is not an open library.

2158
01:22:31.903 --> 01:22:34.929
"This is a place of research."

2159
01:22:34.929 --> 01:22:36.042
LIAM: Understood.

2160
01:22:36.042 --> 01:22:40.276
MARISHA: I apologize. The thing is we're here

2161
01:22:40.276 --> 01:22:42.743
under a diplomatic mission.

2162
01:22:42.743 --> 01:22:47.743
I'm actually Beauregard Lionett with the Cobalt Soul.

2163
01:22:48.474 --> 01:22:50.247
MATT: Kind of reaches-- brow ruffles.

2164
01:22:50.247 --> 01:22:51.201
"Cobalt Soul?"

2165
01:22:51.201 --> 01:22:52.401
MARISHA: Yeah.

2166
01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:53.926
MATT: "You probably want to speak to--

2167
01:22:53.926 --> 01:22:56.209
"what's his name. Demid?"

2168
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:57.898
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm sure you have a representative here.

2169
01:22:57.898 --> 01:23:00.656
We didn't have them throughout the Empire.

2170
01:23:00.656 --> 01:23:02.509
MATT: "They just occasionally wander through.

2171
01:23:02.509 --> 01:23:04.656
"I'll look into it."

2172
01:23:04.656 --> 01:23:06.971
MARISHA: Check and see if he's in.

2173
01:23:06.971 --> 01:23:07.804
LIAM: That's the first time you said

2174
01:23:07.804 --> 01:23:08.813
the last name out loud, right?

2175
01:23:08.813 --> 01:23:09.922
MARISHA: Yes, it is.

2176
01:23:09.922 --> 01:23:11.451
TRAVIS: Yeah, I thought so.

2177
01:23:11.451 --> 01:23:12.735
MATT: He gets up and walks away.

2178
01:23:12.735 --> 01:23:13.756
The old woman's still sitting there,

2179
01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:15.723
just not paying any attention--

2180
01:23:15.723 --> 01:23:16.556
MARISHA: Lionett.

2181
01:23:16.556 --> 01:23:19.743
MATT: --or giving two shits about your presence.

2182
01:23:19.743 --> 01:23:24.743
You wait for two minutes, three minutes.

2183
01:23:24.843 --> 01:23:26.109
LAURA: Hi.

2184
01:23:28.508 --> 01:23:30.497
MATT: "Right."

2185
01:23:30.497 --> 01:23:34.147
LAURA: Do you have any books about weasels?

2186
01:23:35.913 --> 01:23:36.765
MATT: "Yes."

2187
01:23:36.765 --> 01:23:37.973
LAURA: Can I see one?

2188
01:23:37.973 --> 01:23:39.378
MATT: "No."

2189
01:23:39.378 --> 01:23:42.712
LAURA: Do you have any books about...

2190
01:23:44.194 --> 01:23:45.843
the Traveler?

2191
01:23:45.843 --> 01:23:47.360
MATT: "Don't know what that is."

2192
01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.624
LAURA: What kind of a-- anyway.

2193
01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:52.678
(laughter)

2194
01:23:52.678 --> 01:23:55.262
SAM: Do you have any books about alchemy?

2195
01:23:55.262 --> 01:23:56.095
MATT: "Yes."

2196
01:23:56.095 --> 01:23:56.928
LAURA: Can we see it?

2197
01:23:56.928 --> 01:23:57.769
MATT: "Nope."

2198
01:23:57.769 --> 01:23:59.504
SAM: How can we see it?

2199
01:23:59.504 --> 01:24:02.212
MATT: "Your representative is already on his way

2200
01:24:02.212 --> 01:24:06.196
"to get you some person to speak to.

2201
01:24:06.196 --> 01:24:07.400
"You've already been helped.

2202
01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.691
"Leave me to my business."

2203
01:24:09.691 --> 01:24:11.284
LAURA: What is she doing?

2204
01:24:11.284 --> 01:24:12.770
MATT: It's a puzzle book.

2205
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:14.740
She's essentially doing--
ALL: Sudoku?

2206
01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:17.343
MATT: Like Sudoku, crossword puzzles.

2207
01:24:17.343 --> 01:24:18.176
LAURA: Amazing.

2208
01:24:18.176 --> 01:24:19.009
TALIESIN: Wow.

2209
01:24:19.009 --> 01:24:20.219
SAM: Do you come here, Reani, a lot?

2210
01:24:20.219 --> 01:24:21.052
MICA: I do.

2211
01:24:22.499 --> 01:24:24.999
SAM: Do you have a card or something, a library card?

2212
01:24:24.999 --> 01:24:26.875
MICA: Noticing this, how long have we been waiting?

2213
01:24:26.875 --> 01:24:28.738
MATT: About four minutes.
MICA: Only four minutes?

2214
01:24:28.738 --> 01:24:29.854
MATT: Four to five minutes.

2215
01:24:29.854 --> 01:24:30.919
TALIESIN: (groans)

2216
01:24:30.919 --> 01:24:32.093
(laughter)

2217
01:24:32.093 --> 01:24:34.176
LAURA: (groans)

2218
01:24:36.491 --> 01:24:37.996
MICA: I'll step up to the desk

2219
01:24:37.996 --> 01:24:40.003
and be like: Um, excuse me,

2220
01:24:40.003 --> 01:24:42.206
I know you're busy with your puzzle book

2221
01:24:42.206 --> 01:24:45.248
and I know that she had a really cool fancy last name,

2222
01:24:45.248 --> 01:24:48.456
but the Ivae'ess has sent me,

2223
01:24:48.456 --> 01:24:51.415
so we have to go see books now.

2224
01:24:51.415 --> 01:24:52.515
Is that cool?

2225
01:24:52.515 --> 01:24:54.589
We have to go see books now.

2226
01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:55.422
MATT: "What kind of piece of--

2227
01:24:55.422 --> 01:24:56.996
"What, what did you say?"

2228
01:24:56.996 --> 01:24:59.612
MICA: The Ivae'ess has sent me,

2229
01:24:59.612 --> 01:25:02.607
so we have to go see books now.

2230
01:25:02.607 --> 01:25:03.440
Whatever they need.

2231
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.678
MATT: "I'll go fetch the Scribewarden. Hold on."

2232
01:25:06.678 --> 01:25:07.967
MICA: Thank you!

2233
01:25:07.967 --> 01:25:09.739
Have a good day!

2234
01:25:09.739 --> 01:25:10.572
SAM: What is that?

2235
01:25:10.572 --> 01:25:12.540
TRAVIS: How are you executive platinum? What just happened?

2236
01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.755
SAM: What is Ivae'ess?

2237
01:25:13.755 --> 01:25:14.588
MICA: Oh so...

2238
01:25:16.095 --> 01:25:17.467
(inaudible whispering)

2239
01:25:17.467 --> 01:25:18.300
SAM: Yeah yeah yeah.

2240
01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.130
LAURA: (whispering) Okay, what?

2241
01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:23.061
MICA: Remember the time that I keep everybody safe?

2242
01:25:23.061 --> 01:25:23.894
LAURA: Yeah.

2243
01:25:23.894 --> 01:25:28.327
MICA: So I do it as only animals,

2244
01:25:28.327 --> 01:25:30.647
and I keep everybody safe,

2245
01:25:30.647 --> 01:25:32.599
and they've of started calling me Ivae'ess

2246
01:25:32.599 --> 01:25:35.282
and that means the Lightbringer or whatever

2247
01:25:35.282 --> 01:25:37.179
and it's kind of a cool legend around here.

2248
01:25:37.179 --> 01:25:38.012
LAURA: Are you a superhero?

2249
01:25:38.012 --> 01:25:39.140
MICA: Kinda?

2250
01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:39.973
SAM: What?

2251
01:25:39.973 --> 01:25:41.610
MICA: Shh, nobody knows!

2252
01:25:41.610 --> 01:25:43.582
SAM: But that's-- so this is your secret identity?

2253
01:25:43.582 --> 01:25:44.496
MICA: Shh.

2254
01:25:44.496 --> 01:25:47.246
SAM: So Reani is your secret--
MICA: Shh!

2255
01:25:48.739 --> 01:25:51.303
SAM: (softly) So Reani's really Ivae'ess?

2256
01:25:51.303 --> 01:25:52.136
MICA: Yeah.

2257
01:25:52.136 --> 01:25:54.844
SAM: Do you change your personalities, your persona,

2258
01:25:54.844 --> 01:25:55.914
do you--

2259
01:25:55.914 --> 01:25:59.935
MICA: I change into a scorpion or a bear

2260
01:25:59.935 --> 01:26:03.635
or a wolf or an eagle or a snake.

2261
01:26:03.635 --> 01:26:05.206
SAM: How do they know it's you, then?

2262
01:26:05.206 --> 01:26:07.241
LAURA: Because where else are there going to be animals

2263
01:26:07.241 --> 01:26:08.355
around like that down here?

2264
01:26:08.355 --> 01:26:09.419
SAM: Well, there's animals.

2265
01:26:09.419 --> 01:26:11.636
MICA: It's kind of rare to see

2266
01:26:11.636 --> 01:26:13.652
animals with halos and gold eyes.

2267
01:26:13.652 --> 01:26:14.485
SAM: Ah.

2268
01:26:14.485 --> 01:26:15.318
LAURA: They haven't caught on

2269
01:26:15.318 --> 01:26:16.778
that you have a halo and gold eyes?

2270
01:26:16.778 --> 01:26:17.611
MICA: No.

2271
01:26:17.611 --> 01:26:18.444
LAURA: They're dumb.

2272
01:26:18.444 --> 01:26:20.592
(laughter)

2273
01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:21.425
SAM: Wow.

2274
01:26:21.425 --> 01:26:23.359
MICA: It's kind of fun, and I've been here for five years,

2275
01:26:23.359 --> 01:26:24.800
and so people keep talking about it

2276
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.310
and sometimes there are drawings and stuff

2277
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:28.695
of me as an eagle. I'm like:

2278
01:26:28.695 --> 01:26:29.528
Whoa, that's me!

2279
01:26:29.528 --> 01:26:30.425
But I can't tell them that it's me

2280
01:26:30.425 --> 01:26:31.363
because then that'll blow my cover

2281
01:26:31.363 --> 01:26:32.376
and then people would come to kill me

2282
01:26:32.376 --> 01:26:34.503
because lots of the crime families that I keep,

2283
01:26:34.503 --> 01:26:36.308
you know, on the DL,

2284
01:26:36.308 --> 01:26:38.637
they would want to kill me so--

2285
01:26:38.637 --> 01:26:41.616
LIAM: So this is like another identity for yourself?

2286
01:26:41.616 --> 01:26:42.774
MICA: Yeah, and if you tell anybody

2287
01:26:42.774 --> 01:26:43.940
I'm going to have to kill you.

2288
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:46.380
MARISHA: Ehh!
LAURA: Oh-ho-ho!

2289
01:26:47.942 --> 01:26:49.547
MATT: The door opens and you watch as

2290
01:26:49.547 --> 01:26:52.721
the old dwarf woman returns and then sits down at the desk,

2291
01:26:52.721 --> 01:26:56.596
followed by what you see is a very tall,

2292
01:26:57.441 --> 01:26:59.218
pale-skinned elven woman with

2293
01:26:59.218 --> 01:27:01.479
a platinum blonde pompadour, short in the back,

2294
01:27:01.479 --> 01:27:03.224
but just billowing in the front.

2295
01:27:03.224 --> 01:27:04.443
LIAM: Rockabilly!

2296
01:27:04.443 --> 01:27:06.867
MATT: These bright blue piercing eyes,

2297
01:27:06.867 --> 01:27:11.193
you recognize as the Scribewarden, approaches.

2298
01:27:11.193 --> 01:27:13.056
"Hello, Reani.

2299
01:27:13.056 --> 01:27:18.051
"Word is that you've come on the request of the Ivae'ess?"

2300
01:27:18.051 --> 01:27:18.884
MICA: Yeah.

2301
01:27:18.884 --> 01:27:19.905
MATT: And gives a wink.

2302
01:27:19.905 --> 01:27:21.352
MICA: (laughs) Uh-huh!

2303
01:27:21.352 --> 01:27:24.185
MATT: You get the immediate sense that

2304
01:27:25.686 --> 01:27:27.313
she's not good with keeping that--

2305
01:27:27.313 --> 01:27:28.493
(laughter)

2306
01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:30.518
MATT: -- secret identity.

2307
01:27:31.419 --> 01:27:32.252
TALIESIN: Is Reani Clark--

2308
01:27:32.252 --> 01:27:33.787
everyone knows Clark Kent's really Superman.

2309
01:27:33.787 --> 01:27:35.324
Everyone's like, "Oh no!

2310
01:27:35.324 --> 01:27:37.047
"Superman, you just showed up!

2311
01:27:37.047 --> 01:27:38.067
"Where did Clark go?"

2312
01:27:38.067 --> 01:27:39.395
(laughs)

2313
01:27:39.395 --> 01:27:42.780
MATT: "So what can we do to help the Ivae'ess?"

2314
01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:46.338
MICA: So he likes books.

2315
01:27:46.338 --> 01:27:48.535
She likes weasels,
LAURA: (whispers) I do!

2316
01:27:48.535 --> 01:27:50.536
MICA: And we need to find a dragon.

2317
01:27:50.536 --> 01:27:52.329
A white dragon.

2318
01:27:52.329 --> 01:27:53.218
MATT: "A white dragon?"

2319
01:27:53.218 --> 01:27:55.232
MICA: Yeah.

2320
01:27:55.232 --> 01:27:56.984
MARISHA: Also if you do have a representative of

2321
01:27:56.984 --> 01:27:59.247
the Cobalt Soul here, that would be cool,

2322
01:27:59.247 --> 01:28:01.401
because I did mention that.

2323
01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:03.381
LIAM: But if you're offering, we would love to peruse

2324
01:28:03.381 --> 01:28:06.476
any books you have on the subject of mythical beasts

2325
01:28:06.476 --> 01:28:09.667
or creatures of great repute or dunamancy

2326
01:28:09.667 --> 01:28:12.785
or local legends or--
MICA: And weasels!

2327
01:28:12.785 --> 01:28:14.035
LAURA: Or Laughing Hands.

2328
01:28:14.035 --> 01:28:16.305
MATT: "One book at a time."

2329
01:28:16.305 --> 01:28:18.010
SAM: Let's prioritize. Caleb?

2330
01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:21.789
MATT: "What do you wish us to retrieve?"

2331
01:28:21.789 --> 01:28:23.622
LIAM: Creatures of this realm.

2332
01:28:23.622 --> 01:28:25.347
TALIESIN: White dragons.
LIAM: Local legends that

2333
01:28:25.347 --> 01:28:27.974
might talk of--

2334
01:28:27.974 --> 01:28:29.257
SAM: White dragons.
LIAM: --beasts like,

2335
01:28:29.257 --> 01:28:30.732
yeah, I think you've said it multiple times,

2336
01:28:30.732 --> 01:28:32.261
I think she heard.

2337
01:28:32.261 --> 01:28:33.782
White dragons.
LAURA: White dragons.

2338
01:28:33.782 --> 01:28:34.850
TALIESIN: Yeah, white dragons.

2339
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:37.210
MATT: "I'll return with such a tome.

2340
01:28:37.210 --> 01:28:40.873
"The price is 10 gold per hour of research."

2341
01:28:40.873 --> 01:28:43.474
LAURA: And you can only look at one book at a time?

2342
01:28:43.474 --> 01:28:44.307
SAM: Per person?

2343
01:28:44.307 --> 01:28:47.434
MATT: "Multiple books, as one per individual,

2344
01:28:47.434 --> 01:28:49.763
"of course each paying independently.

2345
01:28:49.763 --> 01:28:52.580
"We have to fund our research somehow.

2346
01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.614
"As you know, Reani."

2347
01:28:53.614 --> 01:28:54.447
SAM: Sure.

2348
01:28:54.447 --> 01:28:56.213
LIAM: Excellent, so if we are getting a couple books

2349
01:28:56.213 --> 01:28:58.778
for a few of us to read, I will cover the costs.

2350
01:28:58.778 --> 01:29:01.923
Do you have anything also on

2351
01:29:01.923 --> 01:29:04.331
more intricate forms

2352
01:29:04.331 --> 01:29:08.106
of transmutative magic here?

2353
01:29:08.106 --> 01:29:10.011
MATT: "I can certainly look.

2354
01:29:11.348 --> 01:29:12.181
"So who will be taking

2355
01:29:12.181 --> 01:29:15.069
"the possible tome of transmutative magic?"

2356
01:29:15.069 --> 01:29:16.305
LIAM: That will be for me.

2357
01:29:16.305 --> 01:29:17.138
MATT: "Right.

2358
01:29:17.138 --> 01:29:18.366
"Then who is taking the interest

2359
01:29:18.366 --> 01:29:20.144
"in mythological creatures and folklore?"

2360
01:29:20.144 --> 01:29:21.126
MARISHA: I'll take that.

2361
01:29:21.126 --> 01:29:22.464
MATT: "All right, that's two.

2362
01:29:22.464 --> 01:29:23.808
"Who else needs one?"

2363
01:29:23.808 --> 01:29:26.273
TALIESIN: Anything have pictures in it, is mostly pictures?

2364
01:29:26.273 --> 01:29:27.106
MATT: "There's a lot of pictures.

2365
01:29:27.106 --> 01:29:28.431
"I'll get you a picture book."

2366
01:29:28.431 --> 01:29:29.612
TALIESIN: All right.

2367
01:29:29.612 --> 01:29:31.171
With like, what's on, books on--

2368
01:29:31.171 --> 01:29:35.306
TRAVIS: I'll take a book on deities, new and old, perhaps?

2369
01:29:35.306 --> 01:29:36.139
TALIESIN: That'll do.

2370
01:29:36.139 --> 01:29:36.972
MATT: "Very well.

2371
01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:41.568
"Pantheon's would be probably pre-Calamity, is such a thing.

different chemistry mixtures and sticky things

2375
01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:53.401
or puffy things or acid-y things?

2376
01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:54.832
MATT: "All right, five books."

2377
01:29:54.832 --> 01:29:57.047
LIAM: And Jester, you were saying you wanted a book about

2378
01:29:57.047 --> 01:29:59.664
ancient forms of the arcane,

2379
01:29:59.664 --> 01:30:02.684
like the origin of magic in Exandria?

2380
01:30:02.684 --> 01:30:04.200
LAURA: (deadpan) That's what I've been looking for

2381
01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:05.450
my entire life.

2382
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:06.773

2383
01:30:06.773 --> 01:30:10.849
LAURA: Books on the ancient forms of arcane.

2384
01:30:10.849 --> 01:30:14.099
MATT: "Very well."
(laughter)

2385
01:30:16.945 --> 01:30:20.059
TALIESIN: Do you have to roll damage for that?

2386
01:30:20.059 --> 01:30:23.099
TRAVIS: (like Jester) My brain just fell out of my ear!

2387
01:30:23.099 --> 01:30:24.942
MICA: I thought you said weasels.

2388
01:30:24.942 --> 01:30:28.460
LAURA: Ancient arcane weasels, specifically.

2389
01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:29.426
MATT: "I will do my best.

2390
01:30:29.426 --> 01:30:31.996
"And the Ivae'ess requests one."

2391
01:30:31.996 --> 01:30:33.388
MICA: A book of new poisons, please.

2392
01:30:33.388 --> 01:30:34.738
Anything poisonous plants,

2394
01:30:36.818 --> 01:30:38.240

MARISHA: Can I just walk and talk with you

2407
01:31:01.213 --> 01:31:02.990
for a second as we go?

2408
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.617
MATT: "Well, no, I'm retrieving the books for you.

2409

"You must stay here."

MARISHA: Can I walk and talk with you to the threshold

2411
01:31:09.448 --> 01:31:11.207
of which then I will stay behind?

MARISHA: You see, that's what--

2419
01:31:18.682 --> 01:31:20.579
I would like if we could just,

2420
01:31:20.579 --> 01:31:21.912
just real quick.

2421

MATT: She goes ahead and steps off to the side,

2424
01:31:29.926 --> 01:31:30.759
joins you.

2425
01:31:32.336 --> 01:31:33.576
"So?"

2426
01:31:33.576 --> 01:31:36.659
MARISHA: Yes, you may know Archivist Zeenoth

2427
01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:40.406
from Cobalt Soul in Zadash.

2428
01:31:40.406 --> 01:31:42.593
MATT: "I'm familiar with the Cobalt Soul, yes.

2429
01:31:42.593 --> 01:31:45.757
"We do have one such representative

2430
01:31:45.757 --> 01:31:48.042
"here on a research mission."

2431
01:31:48.042 --> 01:31:49.042
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

2432
01:31:49.042 --> 01:31:52.270
That would be good if we could maybe connect with him.

2433
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:56.478
And, if you know, the Cobalt Soul is always interested in

2434
01:31:56.478 --> 01:31:58.482
sharing any type of information

2435
01:31:58.482 --> 01:32:03.415
and having that free flow communication, so--

2436
01:32:03.415 --> 01:32:05.489
MATT: "Of course, what have you for trade then?"

2437
01:32:05.489 --> 01:32:07.104
MARISHA: Sure.

2438
01:32:07.104 --> 01:32:08.801
Sure.

2439
01:32:08.801 --> 01:32:09.753
Yeah.

2440
01:32:09.753 --> 01:32:11.719
I will pull...

2441
01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:15.185
What do I have for trade?

2442
01:32:17.362 --> 01:32:19.122
TRAVIS: You've got some crossbows.

2443
01:32:19.122 --> 01:32:22.200
(laughter)

2444
01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:25.707
MATT: "Look, I know there is free traded information

2445
01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:29.290
"within your troop, your--"

2446
01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:30.514
MARISHA: I have my Crick history book.

2447
01:32:30.514 --> 01:32:33.909
MATT: "--your faction. However, we are a legitimate business

2448
01:32:33.909 --> 01:32:35.336
and there needs to be--"

2449
01:32:35.336 --> 01:32:36.540
MARISHA: I pull out my history book.

2450
01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:37.969
MATT: Okay. You pull out a history book.

2451
01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:41.179
MARISHA: And Courting of the Crick, the smut.

2452
01:32:41.179 --> 01:32:42.612
MATT: Okay, just the general history book?

2453
01:32:42.612 --> 01:32:43.528
What history book do you have?

2454
01:32:43.528 --> 01:32:46.203
MARISHA: It was the one on the Kryn.

2455
01:32:46.203 --> 01:32:47.126
TRAVIS: The smutty one?

2456
01:32:47.126 --> 01:32:47.959
MARISHA: No, I had two.

2457
01:32:47.959 --> 01:32:48.792
TRAVIS: Oh.

2458
01:32:48.792 --> 01:32:49.933
LAURA: Did we already read that whole book?

2459
01:32:49.933 --> 01:32:50.924
The history book?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2460
01:32:50.924 --> 01:32:51.840
MARISHA: I did.
LAURA: Okay.

2461
01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.307
MATT: Yeah. Okay.

2462
01:32:56.721 --> 01:32:58.285
Thumbs through the history book.

2463
01:32:58.285 --> 01:32:59.376
"Interesting."

2464
01:32:59.376 --> 01:33:00.468
MARISHA: The second one's really valuable, too.

2465
01:33:00.468 --> 01:33:03.706
You don't have to look through it.

2466
01:33:03.706 --> 01:33:04.747
MATT: "Oh my."

2467
01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:05.580
MARISHA: Told you.

2468
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.830
LAURA: (tongue clicking)

2469
01:33:09.810 --> 01:33:12.810
MARISHA: She has a bit of anxiety.

2470
01:33:14.252 --> 01:33:15.669
MATT: "Terribly sorry.

2471
01:33:16.911 --> 01:33:21.265
"We'll go ahead and consider this trade for two of the

2472
01:33:21.265 --> 01:33:23.947
"research periods, so 50 gold for the first hour."

2473
01:33:23.947 --> 01:33:25.994
TRAVIS: Here's 10 gold.
LAURA: Not bad, not bad.

2474
01:33:25.994 --> 01:33:27.368
SAM: Sure, 10 gold from me.

2475
01:33:27.368 --> 01:33:29.822
LAURA: Oh, yes, same, same, same, same, same.

2476
01:33:29.822 --> 01:33:31.858
Even though I'm probably just researching for Caleb.

2477
01:33:31.858 --> 01:33:33.658
TRAVIS: Here's two more. That's 40.

2478
01:33:33.658 --> 01:33:35.308
Who's got 10 gold for Scribewarden?

2479
01:33:35.308 --> 01:33:36.922
LIAM: Oh, sorry.

2480
01:33:36.922 --> 01:33:38.512
I was looking through my things.

2481
01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:40.459
I will cover all of it if need be.

2482
01:33:40.459 --> 01:33:42.017
MARISHA: I'll put forward 10 gold, too,

2483
01:33:42.017 --> 01:33:43.467
and give me back the smut.

2484
01:33:43.467 --> 01:33:44.472
TRAVIS: We're covered.

2485
01:33:44.472 --> 01:33:45.472
MARISHA: Thank you.

2486
01:33:47.734 --> 01:33:48.847
MATT: "I'll return,"

2487
01:33:48.847 --> 01:33:50.854
and she leaves, and as soon as she passes by,

2488
01:33:50.854 --> 01:33:53.537
you can see the elven man who was originally here

2489
01:33:53.537 --> 01:33:55.665
enters, giving a bow of respect

2490
01:33:55.665 --> 01:33:59.414
towards the Scribewarden and behind, you see entering,

2491
01:33:59.414 --> 01:34:01.635
looks to be a male gnome with

2492
01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:06.388
a curly mop of red hair, blue eyes, and Cobalt Soul attire,

2493
01:34:06.388 --> 01:34:07.221
familiar to you guys

2494
01:34:07.221 --> 01:34:09.342
who have been by the archives in Zadash.

2495
01:34:09.342 --> 01:34:11.572
Comes in with himself,

2496
01:34:11.572 --> 01:34:13.866
a pair of his own large, wide spectacles

2497
01:34:13.866 --> 01:34:16.068
to match the dwarven woman who met you at the front

2498
01:34:16.068 --> 01:34:17.651
and as he steps in,

2499
01:34:18.838 --> 01:34:22.205
"Hello, sorry. I was called here for someone?"

2500
01:34:22.205 --> 01:34:23.451
MARISHA: Yeah, that's me.

2501
01:34:23.451 --> 01:34:26.730
MATT: "Right, right, I was in the middle of my research."

2502
01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:27.563
MARISHA: Cool.

2503
01:34:28.431 --> 01:34:30.134
You want to chat?

2504
01:34:30.134 --> 01:34:30.967
MATT: "Certainly.

2505
01:34:30.967 --> 01:34:33.966
"Are you here as well studying the moons?"

2506
01:34:33.966 --> 01:34:36.304
MARISHA: Absolutely.

2507
01:34:36.304 --> 01:34:38.824
MATT: "Are you a specialist?"

2508
01:34:38.824 --> 01:34:41.137
MARISHA: I... am.

2509
01:34:41.137 --> 01:34:44.276
MATT: "Well, please tell me all about your mission here!

2510
01:34:44.276 --> 01:34:45.288
"I'm curious."

2511
01:34:45.288 --> 01:34:46.163
LIAM: Me, too.

2512
01:34:46.163 --> 01:34:47.750
MARISHA: Him ,too.

2513
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:50.227
MATT: "Right, all right. Who're you both with?"

2514
01:34:50.227 --> 01:34:53.310
MARISHA: I'm actually from the Cobalt Soul from Zadash.

2515
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:54.538
MATT: "Oh, really?"
MARISHA: Yeah.

2516
01:34:54.538 --> 01:34:56.161
MATT: "How interesting!

2517
01:34:56.161 --> 01:34:57.490
"Are you as well?"

2518
01:34:57.490 --> 01:34:58.366
MARISHA: Yeah.

2519
01:34:58.366 --> 01:35:00.250
MATT: "All right!"

2520
01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:01.535
Make a deception check.

2521
01:35:01.535 --> 01:35:03.760
(laughter)

2522
01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.316
MARISHA: 24.

2523
01:35:09.316 --> 01:35:10.198
MATT: "Wonderful!

2524
01:35:10.198 --> 01:35:13.642
"Wonderful to meet others so far north here!

2525
01:35:13.642 --> 01:35:16.138
"I felt a bit isolated for some time,

2526
01:35:16.138 --> 01:35:20.007
"so it's very exciting to meet other scholars."

2527
01:35:20.007 --> 01:35:21.482
LIAM: Lonely work.

2528
01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:22.954
MATT: "Oh very, very.

2529
01:35:22.954 --> 01:35:26.037
"So I'm primarily researching Ruidus,

2530
01:35:27.333 --> 01:35:29.664
"the smaller of our moons."

2531
01:35:29.664 --> 01:35:31.611
MARISHA: Ruidus.

2532
01:35:31.611 --> 01:35:36.286
MATT: So you do know there are two moons of Exandria.

2533
01:35:36.286 --> 01:35:37.881
There's Catha, which is the main moon,

2534
01:35:37.881 --> 01:35:40.068
that's the one that's largely associated with the Moonweaver

2535
01:35:40.068 --> 01:35:43.770
and the bright one that moves in the sky,

2536
01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:45.383
and there's Ruidus, there's the secondary moon,

2537
01:35:45.383 --> 01:35:47.925
which is a dull brown color,

2538
01:35:47.925 --> 01:35:49.661
is much smaller and further

2539
01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:53.653
and is mostly not visible throughout most of the day

2540
01:35:53.653 --> 01:35:57.876
and usually only during certain points of night.

2541
01:35:57.876 --> 01:36:02.876
"So I'm hoping and working here with the Woodset Auditors

2542
01:36:02.954 --> 01:36:06.096
"to see if there is some information

2543
01:36:06.096 --> 01:36:09.274
"that may have been recovered from the ruins of Molaesmyr,

2544
01:36:09.274 --> 01:36:12.684
"and so far it's been a lot of false leads,

2545
01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:14.679
"but I'm working on it anyway.

2546
01:36:14.679 --> 01:36:16.681
"What have you been looking for?

2547
01:36:16.681 --> 01:36:19.157
"What is your process?

2548
01:36:19.157 --> 01:36:20.636
"Please tell me anything!"

2549
01:36:20.636 --> 01:36:22.178
MARISHA: What was your name, by the way?

2550
01:36:22.178 --> 01:36:23.595
MATT: "Oh! God! Sorry!

2551
01:36:24.484 --> 01:36:26.596
"Archivist Demid Sunlash."

2552
01:36:26.596 --> 01:36:27.429
LIAM: Sunlesh?

2553
01:36:27.429 --> 01:36:28.262
MATT: "Sunlash."

2554
01:36:28.262 --> 01:36:29.095
LIAM: Sunlash.

2555
01:36:29.095 --> 01:36:32.269
MARISHA: Archivist Demid?

2556
01:36:32.269 --> 01:36:33.144
MATT: "Demid, yes."

2557
01:36:33.144 --> 01:36:37.278
MARISHA: Demid Sunlash.
MATT: Raises his glasses a bit.

2558
01:36:37.278 --> 01:36:38.895
He's tiny, like even for a gnome,

2559
01:36:38.895 --> 01:36:40.677
he's slightly hunching his shoulders

2560
01:36:40.677 --> 01:36:44.400
and probably comes up to mid-thigh for you, Beauregard.

2561
01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.233
MARISHA: Okay.

2562
01:36:45.233 --> 01:36:46.701
MATT: He's just looking up at both of you.

2563
01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:48.908
LIAM: You said your focus was on Ruidus?

2564
01:36:48.908 --> 01:36:49.908
MATT: "Personally yes,

2565
01:36:49.908 --> 01:36:52.508
"it's the one we know the least about."

2566
01:36:52.508 --> 01:36:55.122
LIAM: We know a bit more about Catha.

2567
01:36:55.122 --> 01:36:55.955
MATT: "Understood, most do,

2568
01:36:55.955 --> 01:36:58.599
"it's mostly just folklore elements,

2569
01:36:58.599 --> 01:37:01.091
"there's not a lot of specific study on it these days

2570
01:37:01.091 --> 01:37:03.394
"which is why I find it such a fascinating subject."

2571
01:37:03.394 --> 01:37:04.979
LIAM: What have you found so far?

2572
01:37:04.979 --> 01:37:09.286
MATT: "It's been a bit dry so far.

2573
01:37:09.286 --> 01:37:10.127
"Hoping.

2574
01:37:10.127 --> 01:37:13.582
"I mean, there's the standard beliefs of various cultures

2575
01:37:13.582 --> 01:37:18.582
"across Exandria of it being an entity of ill omen,

2576
01:37:19.089 --> 01:37:20.220
"you know."

2577
01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.570
MRAISHA: Yeah, speaking of the ill omen thing,

2578
01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:23.941
we've actually been trying to research

2579
01:37:23.941 --> 01:37:26.861
the convalescence between the moon cycles

2580
01:37:26.861 --> 01:37:30.344
and beasts and fiends that happen

2581
01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:31.989
because maybe there's a correlation.

2582
01:37:31.989 --> 01:37:34.803
Have you heard of anything?

2583
01:37:34.803 --> 01:37:37.453
MATT: "It, I mean that is very possible.

2584
01:37:37.453 --> 01:37:41.023
"The moon cycles themselves are distinctly related to

2585
01:37:41.023 --> 01:37:44.118
"various entities, whether it be bestial curses

2586
01:37:44.118 --> 01:37:46.533
"or creatures themselves that are nocturnal,

2587
01:37:46.533 --> 01:37:48.696
"you know, they come out by Catha's light to hunt."

2588
01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:49.529
MARISHA: Demons?

2589
01:37:49.529 --> 01:37:52.957
MATT: "Demons, now there is a lot of interesting

2590
01:37:52.957 --> 01:37:54.763
"thoughts and ideas about Catha."

2591
01:37:54.763 --> 01:37:55.596
MARISHA: Yeah.

2592
01:37:55.596 --> 01:37:56.718
MATT: "Or about Ruidus.

2593
01:37:56.718 --> 01:37:58.890
"Ruidus itself, some are believed to have been

2594
01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:03.144
"either a pre-creation, back when the elements themselves

2595
01:38:03.144 --> 01:38:05.718
"were consuming all of Exandria, but others believe

2596
01:38:05.718 --> 01:38:07.240
"may have not originally existed,

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.230
"may have been a creation by the Betrayer Gods

2598
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:12.710
"and was some sort of long-running mysterious plot

2599
01:38:12.710 --> 01:38:16.084
"that was cut short during the end of the Calamity

2600
01:38:16.084 --> 01:38:17.595
"and when they were banished away.

2601
01:38:17.595 --> 01:38:19.719
"That's what I'm certainly curious about."

2602
01:38:19.719 --> 01:38:21.918
MRAISHA: You think demons come from the moon?

2603
01:38:21.918 --> 01:38:23.285
MATT: "I don't. Some people do."

2604
01:38:23.285 --> 01:38:24.934
MARISHA: Okay. White dragons?

2605
01:38:24.934 --> 01:38:26.495
Anything with that?

2606
01:38:26.495 --> 01:38:27.437
LAURA: Those aren't demons.

2607
01:38:27.437 --> 01:38:28.295
MARISHA: No, I know.

2608
01:38:28.295 --> 01:38:30.765
MATT: "Don't follow, but anything, please."

2609
01:38:30.765 --> 01:38:31.915
MARISHA: Just it's separate, you know,

2610
01:38:31.915 --> 01:38:32.990
we've been getting pings

2611
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:35.588
and you know, what's a demon, what's a dragon,

2612
01:38:35.588 --> 01:38:38.197
I don't know, have you heard anything about a white dragon?

2613
01:38:38.197 --> 01:38:40.895
MATT: "Very distinctly different creatures,

2614
01:38:40.895 --> 01:38:42.192
"white dragons and demons.

2615
01:38:42.192 --> 01:38:44.032
"There are many varieties of both, actually."

2616
01:38:44.032 --> 01:38:44.865
MARISHA: No, I know!

2617
01:38:44.865 --> 01:38:45.806
People are stupid, though.

2618
01:38:45.806 --> 01:38:48.272
Have you heard anything about a white dragon?

2619
01:38:48.272 --> 01:38:50.754
LIAM: In the area specifically.

2620
01:38:50.754 --> 01:38:52.651
MATT: "I... no."

2621
01:38:52.651 --> 01:38:53.484
MRAISHA: Okay.

2622
01:38:53.484 --> 01:38:55.352
MATT: "I've just been here for about a year and a half.

2623
01:38:55.352 --> 01:38:58.812
"It's not really going anywhere.

2624
01:38:58.812 --> 01:39:00.159
"Sorry.

2625
01:39:00.159 --> 01:39:00.992
"But if I hear anything,

2626
01:39:00.992 --> 01:39:02.785
"I'll send word to Zadash, don't worry."

2627
01:39:02.785 --> 01:39:04.928
MARISHA: He doesn't know anything about white dragons.

2628
01:39:04.928 --> 01:39:06.692
LIAM: But you can ask him more times.

2629
01:39:06.692 --> 01:39:07.525
MATT: "What about you?

2630
01:39:07.525 --> 01:39:10.172
"What are your findings?"

2631
01:39:10.172 --> 01:39:12.371
LIAM: Well, it's illusory, really, it's as you say,

2632
01:39:12.371 --> 01:39:14.669
everything is shrouded in myth and legend,

2633
01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:16.685
it's mostly superstition.

2634
01:39:16.685 --> 01:39:18.977
Some people say it's made of cheese.

2635
01:39:18.977 --> 01:39:20.779
MATT: "No, what, who?"

2636
01:39:20.779 --> 01:39:22.505
MARISHA: People.
LIAM: People.

2637
01:39:22.505 --> 01:39:24.990
MARISHA: I said they're dumb.

2638
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:26.328
MATT: "Interesting, is there a particular culture

2639
01:39:26.328 --> 01:39:29.145
"that believes this because, I mean--"

2640
01:39:29.145 --> 01:39:31.096
LIAM: Yes, Whitestone.

2641
01:39:31.096 --> 01:39:31.929
MATT: "Whitestone?"

2642
01:39:31.929 --> 01:39:34.730
LIAM: Part of the local myth and legend in Whitestone.

2643
01:39:34.730 --> 01:39:38.101
MATT: "Tal'Dorei is such an uncultured land.

2644
01:39:38.101 --> 01:39:40.603
"Interesting, I'll make note of this and bring it back.

2645
01:39:40.603 --> 01:39:42.853
"I wonder how far that goes.

2646
01:39:44.785 --> 01:39:48.676
"All right, thank you for that nugget of information."

2647
01:39:48.676 --> 01:39:50.180
MARISHA: Question.
MATT: "Yes?"

2648
01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:52.463
MARISHA: They're being a little,

2649
01:39:52.463 --> 01:39:55.071
by the books, no pun intended,

2650
01:39:55.071 --> 01:39:58.366
about letting us view the archives?

2651
01:39:58.366 --> 01:39:59.323
MATT: "Right, right, of course,

2652
01:39:59.323 --> 01:40:01.027
"you have to respect the way they do their business."

2653
01:40:01.027 --> 01:40:03.622
MARISHA: Oh, no, I absolutely do!

2654
01:40:03.622 --> 01:40:04.979
MATT: "They wouldn't let just anyone

2655
01:40:04.979 --> 01:40:07.188
"peruse our libraries openly without interest!"

2656
01:40:07.188 --> 01:40:08.779
MARISHA: Of course! But--

2657
01:40:08.779 --> 01:40:12.192
MATT: "Ioun gives us free reign to spread the information.

2658
01:40:12.192 --> 01:40:16.024
"They don't fall under this same form of religious interest

2659
01:40:16.024 --> 01:40:17.160
"so they're a little more protective.

2660
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.473
"Understandably, too, because this place is very remote

2661
01:40:19.473 --> 01:40:20.749
"and not involved in local politics

2662
01:40:20.749 --> 01:40:22.272
"and does not want to be, you know,

2663
01:40:22.272 --> 01:40:24.653
"a continuous drawer of elven information

2664
01:40:24.653 --> 01:40:28.078
"that would be an unwanted attention towards it.

2665
01:40:28.078 --> 01:40:30.440
MARISHA: Do you think you could give us the hookup?

2666
01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.996
Say something, maybe let us go in?

2667
01:40:31.996 --> 01:40:33.300
Like, get a little look-see?

2668
01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.792
MATT: "Um, I--"

2669
01:40:34.792 --> 01:40:37.434
MARISHA: Plus one, plus two?

2670
01:40:37.434 --> 01:40:39.037
You know, do a little research?

2671
01:40:39.037 --> 01:40:41.841
LIAM: Fellow moon archivists.
MATT: "I'll tell you what."

2672
01:40:41.841 --> 01:40:42.674
LIAM: Yes.

2673
01:40:42.674 --> 01:40:44.690
MATT: "What I can do

2674
01:40:44.690 --> 01:40:48.981
"is show you my notes on Catha and Ruidus."

2675
01:40:48.981 --> 01:40:51.631
LIAM: Well, I'll take what I can get.
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah, sure.

2676
01:40:51.631 --> 01:40:53.050
MATT: "Not now.

2677
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:55.409
"Too many prying eyes and ears.

2678
01:40:55.409 --> 01:40:58.424
"But perhaps,

"perhaps in the next two days, if interested,

01:41:01.882 --> 01:41:04.250
"you could go ahead and meet me,

01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:06.037
"let's see, what would work here,

01:41:06.037 --> 01:41:07.620
"we could meet at...

01:41:09.301 --> 01:41:11.585
"The Tumbled Tankards.

"Bit of a seedy place,

"but I think no one'll pay mind or interest

2686
01:41:15.963 --> 01:41:18.096
"and I can tell you all about what I found.

2687
01:41:18.096 --> 01:41:19.712
"It's not much, but it's interesting!"

2688
01:41:19.712 --> 01:41:20.548
LIAM: Tumble what now?

2689
01:41:20.548 --> 01:41:21.986
MARISHA: Tankards.

2690
01:41:21.986 --> 01:41:24.207
TALIESIN: Basically the D&amp;D equivalent
of the Denny's parking lot.

2691
01:41:24.207 --> 01:41:25.495
(laughter)

2692
01:41:25.495 --> 01:41:27.412
MATT: You're not wrong, no.

2693
01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:29.539
MICA: You don't go there, you wind up there.

2694
01:41:29.539 --> 01:41:30.830
MATT: You wind up there.

2695
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:32.370
LIAM: A CD shop?

2696
01:41:32.370 --> 01:41:33.912
MARISHA: It's a CD shop.

2697
01:41:33.912 --> 01:41:36.072
MATT: Yeah, it's--

2698
01:41:36.072 --> 01:41:37.921
MICA: I know the Denny's parking lot all too well.

2699
01:41:37.921 --> 01:41:41.437
LIAM: Red Hot Chili Peppers, yeah!

2700
01:41:42.819 --> 01:41:44.285
MATT: Unfortunately, the Dark Tower shop

2701
01:41:44.285 --> 01:41:46.368
closed down a while back.

2702
01:41:48.133 --> 01:41:49.477
LIAM: Quit while we're ahead, yeah?

2703
01:41:49.477 --> 01:41:51.912
MARISHA: Okay, well, Caleb and I look,

2704
01:41:51.912 --> 01:41:53.857
I look over his shoulder and quickly read his,

2705
01:41:53.857 --> 01:41:56.274
no, he won't let us read his notes right here.

2706
01:41:56.274 --> 01:41:57.153
MATT: "No no no.

2707
01:41:57.153 --> 01:41:57.986
"Not yet."
LAURA: We have to meet him in

2708
01:41:57.986 --> 01:41:59.128
the Denny's parking lot.

2709
01:41:59.128 --> 01:42:01.585
TALIESIN: We'll go to Denny's if you want a hookup, man.

2710
01:42:01.585 --> 01:42:04.093
MARISHA: Well, you know, I...

2711
01:42:04.093 --> 01:42:06.185
can't guarantee that we won't be busy.

2712
01:42:06.185 --> 01:42:07.865
I don't know if we're going to be available,

2713
01:42:07.865 --> 01:42:10.985
but I'll get back to you.

2714
01:42:10.985 --> 01:42:14.818
MATT: "Right, I'm usually here, so just ask for me."

2715
01:42:16.294 --> 01:42:17.192
MARISHA: Thanks.

2716
01:42:17.192 --> 01:42:18.025
MATT: "Of course.

2717
01:42:18.025 --> 01:42:19.425
"Thank you.

2718
01:42:19.425 --> 01:42:21.588
"If you find any additional information,

"please do pass it along,

"I'm kind of flapping in the wind here a bit."

2721
01:42:26.622 --> 01:42:27.455
MARISHA: Yeah.

2722
01:42:27.455 --> 01:42:28.657
MATT: "Oh, oh oh!"

2723
01:42:28.657 --> 01:42:30.605
He turns and watches as the Scribewarden enters.

2724
01:42:30.605 --> 01:42:32.908
"I'll (clears throat),"

2725
01:42:32.908 --> 01:42:35.556
and heads on back to his research chambers.

2726
01:42:35.556 --> 01:42:36.941
MARISHA: Bye, Sunlash!

2727
01:42:36.941 --> 01:42:41.191
LAURA: I always felt kind of sorry for Ruidus, you know?

2728
01:42:42.509 --> 01:42:44.357
LIAM: Less noticed than its sister.

2729
01:42:44.357 --> 01:42:46.550
LAURA: Yeah, like it's--
MARISHA: It's the ugly duckling.

2730
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:47.921
LAURA: Big flashy sister,

2731
01:42:47.921 --> 01:42:50.649
always trying to take all its attention.

2732
01:42:50.649 --> 01:42:52.920
LIAM: Little sister feeling practically invisible.

2733
01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:53.861
LAURA: Yeah.

2734
01:42:53.861 --> 01:42:54.797
TRAVIS: Are you talking about moons?

2735
01:42:54.797 --> 01:42:55.929
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: They are.

2736
01:42:55.929 --> 01:42:57.384
TRAVIS: Okay.

2737
01:42:57.384 --> 01:43:01.701
MARISHA: My fucking contacts were for shit.

2738
01:43:01.701 --> 01:43:04.667
LIAM: We are a long way from home, Ms. Lionett. Lionett?

2739
01:43:04.667 --> 01:43:06.628
SAM: We found some good books, though.

2740
01:43:06.628 --> 01:43:08.690
LIAM: We've been traveling together for a long time.

2741
01:43:08.690 --> 01:43:11.308
Take that long to drop a proper family name?

2742
01:43:11.308 --> 01:43:12.832
MARISHA: You never asked.

2743
01:43:12.832 --> 01:43:14.514
LIAM: That's true.

2744
01:43:14.514 --> 01:43:15.347
TRAVIS: Shit.

2745
01:43:15.347 --> 01:43:16.802
MATT: The Scribewarden returns and leads you all

2746
01:43:16.802 --> 01:43:19.129
to an independent research chamber

2747
01:43:19.129 --> 01:43:22.910
where there's a large table that everyone's able to sit at.

2748
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:26.274
Under supervision of the Scribewarden,

2749
01:43:26.274 --> 01:43:29.824
and is keeping track of how long you are reading,

2750
01:43:29.824 --> 01:43:33.329
and making sure that no undue use of these tomes

2751
01:43:33.329 --> 01:43:35.029
is carried on.

2752
01:43:35.029 --> 01:43:36.545
You're given your respective books,

2753
01:43:36.545 --> 01:43:38.119
and begin to research.

2754
01:43:38.119 --> 01:43:41.618
Interesting tidbits about different elements of nature

2755
01:43:41.618 --> 01:43:42.451
that can be converted,

2756
01:43:42.451 --> 01:43:43.808
whether they are poisonous to begin with,

2757
01:43:43.808 --> 01:43:47.386
or certain processing can be made into a toxin.

2758
01:43:47.386 --> 01:43:49.761
Some of it's information that you already know

2759
01:43:49.761 --> 01:43:50.797
and some of it is information

2760
01:43:50.797 --> 01:43:52.132
about places you've never been.

2761
01:43:52.132 --> 01:43:53.568
You learn about some other herbs

2762
01:43:53.568 --> 01:43:58.568
that are indigenous to maybe south Xhorhas,

2763
01:43:58.575 --> 01:44:02.298
some of the further south islands of the Menagerie Coast,

2764
01:44:02.298 --> 01:44:06.465
some of it speaks of the Vesperwood that surrounds

2765
01:44:07.557 --> 01:44:12.515
an area of Issylra, which is far far far west of here,

2766
01:44:13.676 --> 01:44:15.352
and also some strange blooms that happen

2767
01:44:15.352 --> 01:44:18.549
in the deserts of Marquet as well

2768
01:44:18.549 --> 01:44:22.071
that have been known to have, essentially,

2769
01:44:22.071 --> 01:44:24.561
induced coma-like effects.

2770
01:44:24.561 --> 01:44:29.011
You just take the information, very fascinating.

2771
01:44:29.011 --> 01:44:33.739
Now you were reading about arcane weasels.

2772
01:44:33.739 --> 01:44:34.669
SAM: Well, I think she was--

2773
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:36.318
(laughter)

2774
01:44:36.318 --> 01:44:38.378
She slipped the book to him, I believe.

2775
01:44:38.378 --> 01:44:43.378
LAURA: Yeah, it was arcane origins and whatever the fuck.

2776
01:44:43.497 --> 01:44:44.988
LIAM: That's the title, that's the specific title.

2777
01:44:44.988 --> 01:44:48.677
LAURA: "Arcane Origins and Whatever the Fuck."

2778
01:44:48.677 --> 01:44:50.368
TALIESIN: Somehow got on the bestseller list.

2779
01:44:50.368 --> 01:44:52.618
(laughter)

2780
01:44:54.482 --> 01:44:55.767
MATT: So you're reading it?

2781
01:44:55.767 --> 01:44:56.668
LAURA: Sure.

2782
01:44:56.668 --> 01:44:57.501
MATT: All right.

2783
01:44:57.501 --> 01:45:02.176
It is a fascinatingly deep, scholarly,

2784
01:45:03.514 --> 01:45:08.283
verbose dissertation on various theories

2785
01:45:08.283 --> 01:45:12.199
on the origins of mythological creatures,

2786
01:45:12.199 --> 01:45:13.803
some of them that believe that they stemmed from

2787
01:45:13.803 --> 01:45:15.913
the breaking of the Elemental Planes when they once were

2788
01:45:15.913 --> 01:45:18.761
just a mashed chaos across the surface of Exandria.

2789
01:45:18.761 --> 01:45:21.225
Some that believe they were born from dreams

2790
01:45:21.225 --> 01:45:24.840
of the first beings that were given life by the pantheon.

2791
01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:26.936
There are some that believe that they were creations,

2792
01:45:26.936 --> 01:45:28.884
magically through those that dabbled in arcane

2793
01:45:28.884 --> 01:45:32.473
or divine based magic

2794
01:45:32.473 --> 01:45:34.605
to suit their own needs and then lost control of them

2795
01:45:34.605 --> 01:45:36.408
and thus they became part of the natural world

2796
01:45:36.408 --> 01:45:38.075
as their own accord.

2797
01:45:39.072 --> 01:45:40.900
LAURA: Anything about blink dogs?

2798
01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:41.733
MATT: Yeah, a thing about blink dogs.

2799
01:45:41.733 --> 01:45:44.434
Blink dogs believed to be fey in nature,

2800
01:45:44.434 --> 01:45:46.454
believed to have originally began in the Feywild

2801
01:45:46.454 --> 01:45:47.974
and then were brought in and partially domesticated

2802
01:45:47.974 --> 01:45:51.782
here in Exandria due to their unique talents.

2803
01:45:51.782 --> 01:45:53.624
Spoke of the difficulty in breaking them,

2804
01:45:53.624 --> 01:45:55.125
especially at a young age

2805
01:45:55.125 --> 01:45:57.528
and how they tend to be a bull in a china shop.

2806
01:45:57.528 --> 01:46:01.845
You immediately like yeah, yeah, I know that.

2807
01:46:01.845 --> 01:46:04.558
LAURA: Any tidbits I would know about Nugget?

2808
01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:07.225
MATT: You learn that preferred foods

2809
01:46:08.151 --> 01:46:12.431
tend to be ground nuts made into a meal.

2810
01:46:12.431 --> 01:46:13.947
LAURA: Oh shit.

2811
01:46:15.241 --> 01:46:16.207
LIAM: You were way off.

2812
01:46:16.207 --> 01:46:18.369
LAURA: I was so far off.

2813
01:46:18.369 --> 01:46:20.179
MATT: For a healthy diet.

2814
01:46:20.179 --> 01:46:21.994
They'll eat pretty much anything.

2815
01:46:21.994 --> 01:46:24.676
That is considered a core element

2816
01:46:24.676 --> 01:46:29.676
as part of the fey life in which it originally stemmed from.

2817
01:46:30.048 --> 01:46:33.069
TRAVIS: Blinking causes a high metabolism.
MATT: You are looking for

2818
01:46:33.069 --> 01:46:35.952
SAM: Just looking for things I can make with chemicals.

2819
01:46:35.952 --> 01:46:38.051
MATT: They're a chemistry book that goes there

2820
01:46:38.051 --> 01:46:40.079
that goes delves in alchemy, same thing,

2821
01:46:40.079 --> 01:46:41.130
similar to what Reani was looking for,

2822
01:46:41.130 --> 01:46:43.271
what a lot of you've already learned.

2823
01:46:43.271 --> 01:46:44.669
A few things here. There are some chemicals

2824
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:48.412
that aren't widely distributed here in Wildemount

2825
01:46:48.412 --> 01:46:51.663
because the materials aren't present and you weren't,

2826
01:46:51.663 --> 01:46:55.493
you didn't grow up in a heavy-trade city necessarily

2827
01:46:55.493 --> 01:46:59.180
so other forms of chemicals that are used to

2828
01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:02.941
dissolve certain minerals and elements,

2829
01:47:02.941 --> 01:47:06.831
it's interesting. Nothing that necessarily

2830
01:47:06.831 --> 01:47:08.594
specifically triggers any interest,

2831
01:47:08.594 --> 01:47:10.917
but I will say that you do,

2832
01:47:10.917 --> 01:47:14.755
you do come to find some easier and better methods

2833
01:47:14.755 --> 01:47:18.360
to refining the chemicals you already work with.

2834
01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.950
That may help reduce the cost of

2835
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:22.752
some of the alchemical components that you wish to purchase.

2836
01:47:22.752 --> 01:47:23.585
SAM: Cool.

2837
01:47:24.616 --> 01:47:26.901
MATT: You were looking at a book of?

2838
01:47:26.901 --> 01:47:31.151
LIAM: It was higher, intricate
levels of transmutative magic,

2839
01:47:31.151 --> 01:47:33.353
I'm looking for things about transformation

2840
01:47:33.353 --> 01:47:36.801
and permanence, not transitory,

2841
01:47:36.801 --> 01:47:39.834
locking that change into place.

2842
01:47:39.834 --> 01:47:40.961
MATT: Okay.

2843
01:47:40.961 --> 01:47:45.586
Yeah, it's a lot of arcane theories on

2844
01:47:45.586 --> 01:47:46.644
the challenge

2845
01:47:46.644 --> 01:47:50.886
of permanence when it comes to transmutative spellcraft.

2846
01:47:50.886 --> 01:47:53.888
How a creature's natural form is intended

2847
01:47:53.888 --> 01:47:57.208
and is stubborn against arcane nature.

2848
01:47:57.208 --> 01:47:59.048
However, there are also entities and creatures

2849
01:47:59.048 --> 01:48:03.716
that they are born not in their natural form

2850
01:48:03.716 --> 01:48:07.077
and have a life coming to discovering that transition

2851
01:48:07.077 --> 01:48:09.055
into their natural form and that magic is actually

2852
01:48:09.055 --> 01:48:12.472
easier and more accepted into that space.

2853
01:48:13.579 --> 01:48:16.744
The permanence element of it is challenging

2854
01:48:16.744 --> 01:48:20.026
up until a certain level of magic.

2855
01:48:20.026 --> 01:48:23.705
Discussions of the temporary elements of Polymorph

2856
01:48:23.705 --> 01:48:27.839
and the supposed idea that there is

2857
01:48:27.839 --> 01:48:32.171
levels of Polymorph-based magic that can induce performance.

2858
01:48:32.171 --> 01:48:34.191
You pick up some tidbits and some interesting ideas

2859
01:48:34.191 --> 01:48:35.377
and some things that start getting

2860
01:48:35.377 --> 01:48:37.693
your mind running a bit.

2861
01:48:37.693 --> 01:48:39.592
It isn't exactly what you're looking for,

2862
01:48:39.592 --> 01:48:40.425
LIAM: Yeah.

2863
01:48:40.425 --> 01:48:42.342
MATT: It's helping just add more

2864
01:48:42.342 --> 01:48:43.923
to the breadth of your understanding.

2865
01:48:43.923 --> 01:48:46.181
LIAM: Yeah, and is that the main focus of this book

2866
01:48:46.181 --> 01:48:49.013
or does it touch on

2867
01:48:49.013 --> 01:48:51.749
the nature of reality itself?

2868
01:48:51.749 --> 01:48:54.057
MATT: No, it was primarily on

2869
01:48:54.057 --> 01:48:56.673
the nature of material elements,

2870
01:48:56.673 --> 01:48:57.969
you have the matter, and ore,

2871
01:48:57.969 --> 01:49:00.599
and the attempts to transition those.

2872
01:49:00.599 --> 01:49:01.898
It goes into discussion of the Philosopher's Stone

2873
01:49:01.898 --> 01:49:03.598
and you wanted to make gold out of lead,

2874
01:49:03.598 --> 01:49:05.237
and other material movements there,

2875
01:49:05.237 --> 01:49:09.347
and the success it's had, once again, temporary,

2876
01:49:09.347 --> 01:49:13.129
elements that usually only helps in the process of

2877
01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:17.558
deception and/or temporary use of materials.

2878
01:49:17.558 --> 01:49:22.336
LIAM: The elements, matter, and the manipulation of.

2879
01:49:22.336 --> 01:49:23.428
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Those things.

2880
01:49:23.428 --> 01:49:24.261
Got it.

2881
01:49:25.157 --> 01:49:26.249
MATT: You had a book on...

2882
01:49:26.249 --> 01:49:27.217
TRAVIS: Deities.

2883
01:49:27.217 --> 01:49:28.272
MATT: The deities.

2884
01:49:28.272 --> 01:49:32.403
It is a discussion of the wide pantheon of Exandria.

2885
01:49:32.403 --> 01:49:36.013
It speaks loosely about the creation myth

2886
01:49:36.013 --> 01:49:39.922
of the realm, it speaks of the tethered elements,

2887
01:49:39.922 --> 01:49:42.581
on how these entities came to the planet

2888
01:49:42.581 --> 01:49:47.323
and attempted to quell the elemental chaos

2889
01:49:47.323 --> 01:49:49.269
that was roiling across the surface

2890
01:49:49.269 --> 01:49:52.552
and the elemental titans that resided here

2891
01:49:52.552 --> 01:49:56.495
before the pantheon came, managing to separate

2892
01:49:56.495 --> 01:49:59.200
and disperse them to their separate elemental planes,

2893
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.877
and bring order, and the beginning of life to the planet.

2894
01:50:01.877 --> 01:50:04.469
It goes into the eventual betraying,

2895
01:50:04.469 --> 01:50:06.399
of what came to be known as Betrayer Gods,

2896
01:50:06.399 --> 01:50:08.632
and the creation of other entities

2897
01:50:08.632 --> 01:50:09.867
that were just born out of the malice

2898
01:50:09.867 --> 01:50:12.085
that then began to find its way into the heart

2899
01:50:12.085 --> 01:50:15.695
of those that were created in the life form

2900
01:50:15.695 --> 01:50:17.245
of the initial pantheon.

2901
01:50:17.245 --> 01:50:19.815
It goes into the discussion about the Age of Arcanum

2902
01:50:19.815 --> 01:50:21.633
in which the gods gave the gift of you know,

2903
01:50:21.633 --> 01:50:23.300
first it was divine,

2904
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:26.025
through worship, the divine presence of magic,

2905
01:50:26.025 --> 01:50:28.014
and then eventually the gift of the arcane.

2906
01:50:28.014 --> 01:50:29.261
Which as opposed to

2907
01:50:29.261 --> 01:50:31.159
the lending of one's essence for magic,

2908
01:50:31.159 --> 01:50:34.451
it taught them to create magic from within themself

2909
01:50:34.451 --> 01:50:39.210
and then became the rise of the,

2910
01:50:39.210 --> 01:50:41.701
for lack of better term, the arrogance

2911
01:50:41.701 --> 01:50:44.969
of certain mortal species and races

2912
01:50:44.969 --> 01:50:46.737
as well as cultures that began to see themselves

2913
01:50:46.737 --> 01:50:49.389
as now equal to or above the gods that created them

2914
01:50:49.389 --> 01:50:50.999
which led into the Age of Arcanum.

2915
01:50:50.999 --> 01:50:53.474
You start going a little numb

2916
01:50:53.474 --> 01:50:54.965
getting to this portion of the process.

2917
01:50:54.965 --> 01:50:56.435
Even then, the Age of Arcanum is a bit spotty.

2918
01:50:56.435 --> 01:50:57.970
A lot of the information is still lost

2919
01:50:57.970 --> 01:51:00.215
with the Calamity and pieces of it

2920
01:51:00.215 --> 01:51:02.088
are still being put together. A lot of it's theories

2921
01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:05.195
and a lot of it's different people's notes about it,

2922
01:51:05.195 --> 01:51:06.733
until it continues into the Calamity.

2923
01:51:06.733 --> 01:51:08.723
There've been multiple times in which the gods have warred

2924
01:51:08.723 --> 01:51:11.203
and a lot of terrible destruction's been wrought,

2925
01:51:11.203 --> 01:51:14.291
but the Calamity itself, at the end of the Age of Arcanum,

2926
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:18.717
was what was responsible for destroying most

2927
01:51:18.717 --> 01:51:20.217
standing society.

2928
01:51:20.217 --> 01:51:22.158
Those that survived, either by going underground

2929
01:51:22.158 --> 01:51:26.901
or escaping, managed to begin the seeds of the current age.

2930
01:51:26.901 --> 01:51:30.076
This was, you know, over 800 years ago.
TRAVIS: Fuuu--

2931
01:51:30.076 --> 01:51:31.173
MATT: It speaks of the Divine Gate,

2932
01:51:31.173 --> 01:51:34.384
it speaks of the banishing of the Betrayer Gods,

2933
01:51:34.384 --> 01:51:37.784
the self-imposed banishment of the Prime Deities,

2934
01:51:37.784 --> 01:51:39.671
the creation of the Divine Gate that separates

2935
01:51:39.671 --> 01:51:42.002
any of them from transgressing onto

2936
01:51:42.002 --> 01:51:45.558
the actual prime material plane of Exandria,

2937
01:51:45.558 --> 01:51:50.249
and you finish. It takes you a few hours to finish this

2938
01:51:50.249 --> 01:51:53.039
and when it does, your head just like (pulsing).

2939
01:51:53.039 --> 01:51:55.246
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fair.

2940
01:51:55.246 --> 01:51:57.294
LIAM: Is that a lot to unpack, that one?

2941
01:51:57.294 --> 01:51:58.382
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2942
01:51:58.382 --> 01:52:00.906
Yes, I feel like most of this is stuff

2943
01:52:00.906 --> 01:52:03.242
that most, some of you already know

2944
01:52:03.242 --> 01:52:07.691
but as an introduction, it's a bitch.

2945
01:52:07.691 --> 01:52:09.479
LIAM: Give me the three-line pitch/summary,

2946
01:52:09.479 --> 01:52:11.426
what are the good bits?

2947
01:52:11.426 --> 01:52:15.447
TRAVIS: Yes, there were good gods and bad gods

2948
01:52:15.447 --> 01:52:19.378
and they fought and there were ruined parts of the world

2949
01:52:19.378 --> 01:52:23.278
and littler things were left in its wake

2950
01:52:23.278 --> 01:52:27.016
and some were sealed away and some remained.

2951
01:52:27.016 --> 01:52:28.061
LIAM: Right, right, right.

2952
01:52:28.061 --> 01:52:30.162
TRAVIS: There were planes and alternate dimensions

2953
01:52:30.162 --> 01:52:34.202
and-- I might need to sleep tonight, actually,

2954
01:52:34.202 --> 01:52:35.935
to process all of this.

2955
01:52:35.935 --> 01:52:38.281
LIAM: Are you finished with that one?

2956
01:52:38.281 --> 01:52:40.402
TRAVIS: Yes, would you like to?

2957
01:52:40.402 --> 01:52:41.235
LIAM: Yes.

2958
01:52:41.235 --> 01:52:42.471
TRAVIS: Please, have at it.

2959
01:52:42.471 --> 01:52:43.848
MATT: We're now pushing into hour four of research,

2960
01:52:43.848 --> 01:52:44.810
by the way, guys.

2961
01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:46.367
Every hour is an additional 10 gold

2962
01:52:46.367 --> 01:52:47.322
per book that's brought out

2963
01:52:47.322 --> 01:52:49.851
and there are currently seven books checked out.

2964
01:52:49.851 --> 01:52:52.059
So we're looking at right now--

2965
01:52:52.059 --> 01:52:54.558
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: A total of 200 and--

2966
01:52:54.558 --> 01:52:56.835
Lowered by 20 gold as part of--

2967
01:52:56.835 --> 01:52:58.145
so it's only 50 gold per hour

2968
01:52:58.145 --> 01:53:00.420
so you're looking at about 200 gold cost.

2969
01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:04.051
TRAVIS: If there's anyone still diving deep,

2970
01:53:04.051 --> 01:53:05.914
I don't want to interrupt,

2971
01:53:05.914 --> 01:53:07.223
I'm tapped.

2972
01:53:07.223 --> 01:53:09.593
I can certainly go back to Umi

2973
01:53:09.593 --> 01:53:13.092
and see if the mithral that we've gathered is enough.

2974
01:53:13.092 --> 01:53:14.616
TALIESIN: I'll join you, if you'd like.
TRAVIS: I'll meet you back

2975
01:53:14.616 --> 01:53:16.800
on the outside of the archive, yes?

2976
01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:17.800
MICA: I'll come!

2977
01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:18.633
TRAVIS: Great.

2978
01:53:18.633 --> 01:53:20.467
LIAM: I would like to stay, would you like to swing by

2979
01:53:20.467 --> 01:53:21.868
and pick me up when you're finished?

2980
01:53:21.868 --> 01:53:23.864
TRAVIS: We'll wait for you on the outside, I'm sure.

2981
01:53:23.864 --> 01:53:25.689
If for some reason you come out and we're not they're,

2982
01:53:25.689 --> 01:53:28.050
we'll be back at Umi's, yes.

2983
01:53:28.050 --> 01:53:29.721
LIAM: Our lodgings.

2984
01:53:29.721 --> 01:53:32.873
LAURA: Are there any books about healing?

2985
01:53:32.873 --> 01:53:34.481
MATT: There are books about healing.

2986
01:53:34.481 --> 01:53:36.735
LAURA: Healing spells and stuff?

2987
01:53:36.735 --> 01:53:38.718
MATT: Oh yeah, that could definitely be brought.

2988
01:53:38.718 --> 01:53:40.601
LAURA: Okay.

2989
01:53:40.601 --> 01:53:43.346
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

2990
01:53:46.406 --> 01:53:47.412
LIAM: 18.

2991
01:53:47.412 --> 01:53:48.809
MATT: 18.

2992
01:53:48.809 --> 01:53:50.482
As you're getting towards the end

2993
01:53:50.482 --> 01:53:53.047
of your transmutation book,

2994
01:53:53.047 --> 01:53:56.228
you notice that one of the pages,

2995
01:53:56.228 --> 01:54:00.145
the ink is different from the rest of the book.

2996
01:54:02.046 --> 01:54:06.737
LIAM: And I would know if it was arcane in nature or--

2997
01:54:06.737 --> 01:54:08.809
MATT: Roll an arcana check.

2998
01:54:08.809 --> 01:54:09.825
TRAVIS: Red ink.

2999
01:54:11.286 --> 01:54:12.505
LIAM: 23.

3000
01:54:12.505 --> 01:54:13.338
MATT: 23.

3001
01:54:13.338 --> 01:54:15.676
This page holds a very simple

3002
01:54:15.676 --> 01:54:17.676
transmutative spell on it,

3003
01:54:18.883 --> 01:54:23.687
usually used to conceal or contain something

3004
01:54:23.687 --> 01:54:27.633
just beyond the boundaries of this reality.

3005
01:54:27.633 --> 01:54:29.632
It's like stumbling upon a pocket on your jeans

3006
01:54:29.632 --> 01:54:32.382
you didn't know was there before.

3007
01:54:34.827 --> 01:54:36.175
LIAM: Oh jeez.

3008
01:54:36.175 --> 01:54:37.034
MATT: You are under supervision.

3009
01:54:37.034 --> 01:54:37.867
LIAM: Yeah.

3010
01:54:41.178 --> 01:54:42.663
LIAM: Um.

3011
01:54:42.663 --> 01:54:44.449
SAM: I'm still with you in the library.

3012
01:54:44.449 --> 01:54:45.782
LAURA: Yeah, so am I.

3013
01:54:46.764 --> 01:54:49.920
If you need a distraction...

3014
01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:51.303
LIAM: Where is everybody else at this time?

3015
01:54:51.303 --> 01:54:52.747
MARISHA: We're all still here.

3016
01:54:52.747 --> 01:54:54.604
SAM: Didn't you guys step out?
MARISHA: Unless they left.

3017
01:54:54.604 --> 01:54:55.704
MATT: You guys all stepped out.

3018
01:54:55.704 --> 01:54:58.798
TALIESIN: The three of us have left.

3019
01:54:58.798 --> 01:55:02.756
TALIESIN: All forms of vague moral authority
have left the building.

3020
01:55:02.756 --> 01:55:04.572
MATT: All right, so you two and the Fjord?

3021
01:55:04.572 --> 01:55:06.892
TRAVIS: Guess there won't be any killing.

3022
01:55:06.892 --> 01:55:08.089
MATT: The three of you guys are out?

3023
01:55:08.089 --> 01:55:08.922
Or Beau, did you leave with them?

3024
01:55:08.922 --> 01:55:09.755
MARISHA: I'm with them.

3025
01:55:09.755 --> 01:55:10.852
MATT: All right, so you guys left.

3026
01:55:10.852 --> 01:55:12.902
MARISHA: I still haven't read my fiend book

3027
01:55:12.902 --> 01:55:16.702
about local fiends because that's what I was reading.

3028
01:55:16.702 --> 01:55:19.121
MATT: Sorry, that's the next one.

3029
01:55:19.121 --> 01:55:23.505
Local fiends, like fiends specifically, or just creatures?

3030
01:55:23.505 --> 01:55:24.466
LAURA: Like local legends.

3031
01:55:24.466 --> 01:55:27.458
MARISHA: Local legends, that's what I was getting, yeah.

3032
01:55:27.458 --> 01:55:30.048
MATT: It discusses the idea that the Flotket Alps themselves

3033
01:55:30.048 --> 01:55:35.048
are home to a number of various frost giant clans

3034
01:55:35.396 --> 01:55:37.593
that live amongst and within parts of the mountain.

3035
01:55:37.593 --> 01:55:41.829
It speaks of wyvern nests in the peaks.

3036
01:55:41.829 --> 01:55:45.645
It speaks of terrible,

3037
01:55:45.645 --> 01:55:48.583
large lizards that themselves

3038
01:55:48.583 --> 01:55:51.908
are an embodiment of elemental ice.

3039
01:55:51.908 --> 01:55:52.991
It speaks on,

3040
01:55:53.894 --> 01:55:58.894
it speaks of the known,

3041
01:55:58.953 --> 01:56:03.944
the yeti and the terrible yeti that do sometimes peruse

3042
01:56:03.944 --> 01:56:08.107
and supposedly themselves run from

3043
01:56:08.107 --> 01:56:13.107
a larger, more elder yeti that has long haunted

3044
01:56:13.597 --> 01:56:15.451
the folklore of the Flotket Alps.

3045
01:56:15.451 --> 01:56:18.160
TRAVIS: Fucking yetis?!
SAM: Sasquatch!

3046
01:56:19.017 --> 01:56:20.235
TRAVIS: Is that real?

3047
01:56:20.235 --> 01:56:25.170
MATT: You do also find word of a cursed location

3048
01:56:25.170 --> 01:56:29.453
to the far east, northeast of Uthodurn,

3049
01:56:29.453 --> 01:56:31.766
known as Mythburrow.

3050
01:56:32.701 --> 01:56:34.487
It's about 350 miles from here.

3051
01:56:34.487 --> 01:56:35.856
MARISHA: Ooh!
TRAVIS: 350?

3052
01:56:35.856 --> 01:56:37.228
MATT: 350.

3053
01:56:37.228 --> 01:56:39.565
Along the southern end of the Alps.

3054
01:56:39.565 --> 01:56:42.932
Many speak of an ancient dragon of hoarfrost color

3055
01:56:42.932 --> 01:56:45.540
and quaking roar

3056
01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:49.230
that was thought to possibly nest there,

3057
01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:52.331
now unseen in nearly a century.

3058
01:56:52.331 --> 01:56:56.112
This dragon's name is Gelidon, the Nightmare in Ivory.

3059
01:56:56.112 --> 01:56:57.895
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

3060
01:56:57.895 --> 01:57:02.591
LAURA: ♪ Gelidon, the Nightmare in Ivory. ♪

3061
01:57:02.591 --> 01:57:05.424
LIAM: Couldn't his name just be Simon?

3062
01:57:06.425 --> 01:57:08.872
MATT: Dragons are a bit particular about their titles.

3063
01:57:08.872 --> 01:57:11.058
LIAM: "Hello, I'm Simon!

3064
01:57:11.058 --> 01:57:14.194
"I heard you had some teacups you'd like me to breathe on!"

3065
01:57:14.194 --> 01:57:15.723
MARISHA: She's in northeast?

3066
01:57:15.723 --> 01:57:18.938
MATT: Like farther east and slightly northeast.

3067
01:57:18.938 --> 01:57:20.459
TRAVIS: Gelidon.

3068
01:57:20.459 --> 01:57:21.436
MICA: Can't he be like--

3069
01:57:21.436 --> 01:57:23.218
TALIESIN: The Nap in Teflon or something?

3070
01:57:23.218 --> 01:57:24.917
MICA: The Dream in Feathered Pillows.

3071
01:57:24.917 --> 01:57:26.917
TRAVIS: We are here.

3072
01:57:29.021 --> 01:57:32.571
MARISHA: Ooh, fuck that's far!

3073
01:57:35.094 --> 01:57:36.267
SAM: We can teleport, we're fine.

3074
01:57:36.267 --> 01:57:37.100
TRAVIS: No problem.

3075
01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:38.710
LAURA: Let's go back.

3076
01:57:38.710 --> 01:57:43.335
We'll use Essek to teleport us there.

3077
01:57:43.335 --> 01:57:45.636
Then done, and then he can just go home

3078
01:57:45.636 --> 01:57:47.691
and then we'll teleport with Caleb.

3079
01:57:47.691 --> 01:57:49.192
TRAVIS: You need a circle.

3080
01:57:49.192 --> 01:57:50.025
LAURA: Yeah!

3081
01:57:50.025 --> 01:57:51.471
That's why I'm saying we go back,

3082
01:57:51.471 --> 01:57:53.635
we'll get Essek, we go there,

3083
01:57:53.635 --> 01:57:54.967
Caleb's got a circle to go back.

3084
01:57:54.967 --> 01:57:56.810
LAURA: We don't even know, we don't even know,

3085
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:58.848
what if Reani can teleport us?

3086
01:57:58.848 --> 01:57:59.832
LAURA: Reani, can you--

3087
01:57:59.832 --> 01:58:00.899
SAM: She's not with us anymore.

3088
01:58:00.899 --> 01:58:02.958
MATT: No, she's not.
SAM: We're the chaos crew is--

3089
01:58:02.958 --> 01:58:04.451
LAURA: We're just the chaos crew!

3090
01:58:04.451 --> 01:58:05.831
MARISHA: So how are we stealing this fucking spell?

3091
01:58:05.831 --> 01:58:07.071
TRAVIS: Is this just Beau reading this book?

3092
01:58:07.071 --> 01:58:08.000
This is all in Beau's head.

3093
01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.187
LIAM: You know what Nott and--

3094
01:58:09.187 --> 01:58:11.671
MARISHA: Oh, I tell them what I found real quick,

3095
01:58:11.671 --> 01:58:13.119
to the chaos crew.

3096
01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:14.798
SAM: That's great!
LAURA: Holy moly!

3097
01:58:14.798 --> 01:58:16.304
MARISHA: Fucking Gilidon.

3098
01:58:16.304 --> 01:58:17.728
Gilidon or Gildon?

3099
01:58:17.728 --> 01:58:18.598
MATT: Gelidon.

3100
01:58:18.598 --> 01:58:19.636
MARISHA: Gilidon.

3101
01:58:19.636 --> 01:58:21.579
MATT: Like G-E-L-I-D-O-N.

3102
01:58:21.579 --> 01:58:22.584
LIAM: No and--

3103
01:58:22.584 --> 01:58:23.417
SAM: Yes?

3104
01:58:23.417 --> 01:58:25.077
LIAM: I'm going to move onto this other book,

3105
01:58:25.077 --> 01:58:26.792
but I think you would find this interesting.

3106
01:58:26.792 --> 01:58:30.000
This page especially is not your...

3107
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:30.833
average

3108
01:58:30.833 --> 01:58:32.674
Modern Literature.

3109
01:58:32.674 --> 01:58:33.830
This page.

3110
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:36.580
(paper rustling)

3111
01:58:39.002 --> 01:58:40.857
SAM: The thing that we do.

3112
01:58:40.857 --> 01:58:41.701
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3113
01:58:41.701 --> 01:58:44.501
TRAVIS: It's an old fucking--
MARISHA: An oldie?

3114
01:58:45.373 --> 01:58:47.607
TRAVIS: You're breaking out the fucking Vaudeville?!

3115
01:58:47.607 --> 01:58:49.109
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

3116
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:50.812
LAURA: Oh my god, what?

3117
01:58:50.812 --> 01:58:51.860
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

3118
01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:52.693
LAURA: What?!

3119
01:58:54.086 --> 01:58:59.078
SAM: I understand what you're telling me right now!

3120
01:58:59.078 --> 01:59:00.849
LIAM: Are you sure?

3121
01:59:00.849 --> 01:59:02.395
SAM: I think I do!

3122
01:59:02.395 --> 01:59:04.723
MARISHA: Are we being watched?

3123
01:59:04.723 --> 01:59:07.190
Are they watching this exchange?

3124
01:59:07.190 --> 01:59:08.944
MATT: The Scribewarden is watching you all

3125
01:59:08.944 --> 01:59:11.981
and, you know, is just keeping an eye.

3126
01:59:11.981 --> 01:59:13.247
LIAM: She looks a little manic,

3127
01:59:13.247 --> 01:59:15.397
so I'm just going to turn away

3128
01:59:15.397 --> 01:59:17.813
and start reading the book that Fjord was reading.

3129
01:59:17.813 --> 01:59:21.354
Just that page, give it a read.

3130
01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:22.930
SAM: Here, so you handed me this book,

3131
01:59:22.930 --> 01:59:24.314
this book with the page--

3132
01:59:24.314 --> 01:59:26.033
LIAM: It's open with a page open.

3133
01:59:26.033 --> 01:59:26.866
SAM: Oh, okay!

3134
01:59:26.866 --> 01:59:27.766
MATT: The book that you have.

3135
01:59:27.766 --> 01:59:28.599
SAM: Yeah?

3136
01:59:28.599 --> 01:59:30.212
MATT: The Scribewarden comes up and removes it.

3137
01:59:30.212 --> 01:59:31.589
Like, the one you were reading previously.

3138
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:33.778
SAM: Oh, because I'm only allowed one book at a time.

3139
01:59:33.778 --> 01:59:34.889
MATT: Correct.

3140
01:59:34.889 --> 01:59:36.316
It's gathered into a pile on the table.

3141
01:59:36.316 --> 01:59:37.311
LAURA: What about healing books?

3142
01:59:37.311 --> 01:59:39.262
Do you got a healing book?

3143
01:59:39.262 --> 01:59:41.964
MATT: Goes ahead and summons one of the other workers here

3144
01:59:41.964 --> 01:59:45.090
at the Vellum Steeple and eventually retrieves you one,

3145
01:59:45.090 --> 01:59:47.268
talks of various, you know,

3146
01:59:47.268 --> 01:59:48.564
these books aren't instructional

3147
01:59:48.564 --> 01:59:51.054
and healing magic is a difficult thing to teach,

3148
01:59:51.054 --> 01:59:53.353
a lot of times it's just an instinctual thing

3149
01:59:53.353 --> 01:59:54.757
that comes through faith

3150
01:59:54.757 --> 01:59:58.807
or is largely more applied to balms and

3151
01:59:58.807 --> 02:00:02.828
more the creation of healing salves and potions and such,

3152
02:00:02.828 --> 02:00:04.482
but it's interesting.

3153
02:00:04.482 --> 02:00:06.017
LAURA: Oh, okay.

3154
02:00:06.017 --> 02:00:10.016
SAM: I assume there's some note paper around

3155
02:00:10.016 --> 02:00:12.885
or anything for taking notes here or no?

3156
02:00:12.885 --> 02:00:14.533
MATT: Yeah, you can ask for it.

3157
02:00:14.533 --> 02:00:16.118
You're here to research, so you can take your notes

3158
02:00:16.118 --> 02:00:17.175
but you can't take the book with you.

3159
02:00:17.175 --> 02:00:18.939
SAM: I'm going to just write down a little note

3160
02:00:18.939 --> 02:00:22.312
and I'll pass it over to Jester and it says--

3161
02:00:22.312 --> 02:00:23.979
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

3162
02:00:23.979 --> 02:00:26.862
SAM: Oh, okay, okay, sure.

3163
02:00:26.862 --> 02:00:28.894
MATT: Passing notes is still a very noticeable thing.

3164
02:00:28.894 --> 02:00:30.602
SAM: Sure.

3165
02:00:32.082 --> 02:00:32.915
32.

3166
02:00:32.915 --> 02:00:36.950
TALIESIN: Jesus fucking Christ!

3167
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:39.341
MATT: Yeah, you're good at this.

3168
02:00:39.341 --> 02:00:41.824
SAM: The note says,

3169
02:00:41.824 --> 02:00:44.561
I'm going to create a distraction.

3170
02:00:44.561 --> 02:00:49.228
While I do, rip this page out of this book and steal it.

3171
02:00:51.205 --> 02:00:53.005
LAURA: (clicks tongue)

3172
02:00:54.358 --> 02:00:56.058
SAM: (clears throat)

3173
02:00:56.058 --> 02:00:58.475
I have to go to the bathroom!

3174
02:00:59.698 --> 02:01:01.868
Going to get up and start walking

3175
02:01:01.868 --> 02:01:04.651
and then-- oh shit, I don't know!

3176
02:01:04.651 --> 02:01:09.231
I'm going to turn around, draw my crossbow, and say:

3177
02:01:09.231 --> 02:01:11.672
You know what this is for!

3178
02:01:11.672 --> 02:01:14.465
And I'll shoot Caleb (laughter)

3179
02:01:14.465 --> 02:01:16.224
in his side--
LIAM: I'll turn.

3180
02:01:16.224 --> 02:01:18.523
SAM: -- where he keeps the book.

3181
02:01:18.523 --> 02:01:19.481
MATT: Roll an attack roll.

3182
02:01:19.481 --> 02:01:21.731
(laughter)

3183
02:01:22.698 --> 02:01:23.949
SAM: Not great, 17.

3184
02:01:23.949 --> 02:01:24.901
LAURA: That's probably for the best.

3185
02:01:24.901 --> 02:01:26.256
MATT: That definitely hits you.

3186
02:01:26.256 --> 02:01:27.411
Yeah, you don't--
(laughter)

3187
02:01:27.411 --> 02:01:29.281
LAURA: As soon as--
MATT: Even with Mage Armor, that hits you.

3188
02:01:29.281 --> 02:01:30.975
LAURA: -- the Scribewarden's eyes move,

3189
02:01:30.975 --> 02:01:32.429
I'm going to make a move to take the paper.

3190
02:01:32.429 --> 02:01:34.292
MATT: Okay, well first off,

3191
02:01:34.292 --> 02:01:35.650
TALIESIN: Oh no!

3192
02:01:35.650 --> 02:01:37.042
Oh no!

3193
02:01:37.042 --> 02:01:38.991
MATT: Go ahead and--

3194
02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:41.768
MICA: I never should have left!

3195
02:01:41.768 --> 02:01:43.630
MATT: Just roll an acrobatics check for me.

3196
02:01:43.630 --> 02:01:45.988
This is a mild

3197
02:01:45.988 --> 02:01:48.090
skillful attempt to maneuver.
LAURA: But you knew it was coming.

3198
02:01:48.090 --> 02:01:50.614
MATT: Yeah, which is why I'm allowing this.

3199
02:01:50.614 --> 02:01:51.447
LIAM: Six.

3200
02:01:51.447 --> 02:01:52.858
MATT: Six, all right.

3201
02:01:52.858 --> 02:01:55.230
(laughter)

3202
02:01:55.230 --> 02:01:57.312
It misses the book by about an inch.

3203
02:01:57.312 --> 02:01:58.394
LAURA: Oh no!

3204
02:01:58.394 --> 02:01:59.398
MATT: (arrow firing)

3205
02:01:59.398 --> 02:02:00.867
Go ahead and roll damage.

3206
02:02:00.867 --> 02:02:02.468
SAM: You need sneak attack?

3207
02:02:02.468 --> 02:02:03.301
MATT: No.

3208
02:02:05.770 --> 02:02:06.603
LAURA: Oh.

3209
02:02:08.649 --> 02:02:11.399
SAM: Okay, that's 12 points of damage.

3210
02:02:11.399 --> 02:02:12.266
MATT: So (arrow firing).

3211
02:02:12.266 --> 02:02:14.111
SAM: I'll pump in that Fury of the Small, though.

3212
02:02:14.111 --> 02:02:16.361
(laughter)

3213
02:02:19.523 --> 02:02:20.850
MATT: You turn knowingly, and it's like:

3214
02:02:20.850 --> 02:02:23.097
Oh, that's not how this goes!

3215
02:02:23.097 --> 02:02:24.480
Your acting becomes very believable.

3216
02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:26.050
(laughter)

3217
02:02:26.050 --> 02:02:27.983
LIAM: I clutch the book that I was reading

3218
02:02:27.983 --> 02:02:30.624
and I just topple over to the ground clutching it to me

3219
02:02:30.624 --> 02:02:32.327
and actually whimpering.

3220
02:02:32.327 --> 02:02:35.103
MATT: "What are you do- stop that immediately!"

3221
02:02:35.103 --> 02:02:35.936
SAM: He knew!

3222
02:02:35.936 --> 02:02:37.920
He betrayed me!

3223
02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:40.387
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

3224
02:02:40.387 --> 02:02:41.220
LAURA: Okay.

3225
02:02:42.164 --> 02:02:43.922
MATT: I'll say with the distraction with advantage.

3226
02:02:43.922 --> 02:02:44.755
LAURA: Ooh, that's good!

3227
02:02:44.755 --> 02:02:45.755
SAM: Thank god.

3228
02:02:47.332 --> 02:02:49.348
(gasping)
LAURA: Natural 20!

3229
02:02:49.348 --> 02:02:50.181
MATT: Really?

3230
02:02:50.181 --> 02:02:52.299
(cheering)

3231
02:02:52.299 --> 02:02:53.499
MATT: So what's the total?

3232
02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:54.332
LAURA: Oh man.

3233
02:02:55.561 --> 02:02:56.456
28.

3234
02:02:56.456 --> 02:02:57.401
MATT: 28.

3235
02:02:58.487 --> 02:03:00.060
TALIESIN: Natural 20, holy--

3236
02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:01.477
MICA: That was so lucky.

3237
02:03:04.077 --> 02:03:05.027
MATT: The page tears out

3238
02:03:05.027 --> 02:03:07.885
and slips in the inside of your sleeve.

3239
02:03:07.885 --> 02:03:10.070
The Scribewarden is currently focused on the two of you

3240
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:12.561
and is like, "If you don't place that down immediately,

3241
02:03:12.561 --> 02:03:14.552
"we'll have you arrested and thrown into prison!"

3242
02:03:14.552 --> 02:03:16.135
SAM: He cheated on me!

3243
02:03:17.475 --> 02:03:18.473
MARISHA: I tackle Nott.

3244
02:03:18.473 --> 02:03:20.542
SAM: Oh! Yeah.

3245
02:03:20.542 --> 02:03:22.536
MATT: "Good. Hold her down."

3246
02:03:22.536 --> 02:03:25.080
MARISHA: I'm sorry, Scribewarden!

3247
02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:26.592
LAURA: We'll leave, we'll leave, we're so sorry!

3248
02:03:26.592 --> 02:03:27.609
MATT: Two other people come in

3249
02:03:27.609 --> 02:03:30.552
and they start trying to figure our what's happening.

3250
02:03:30.552 --> 02:03:31.618
LAURA: I get on the ground next to Caleb,

3251
02:03:31.618 --> 02:03:33.403
I try to start healing him.

3252
02:03:33.403 --> 02:03:36.227
MATT: They reclaim all the books off the table,

3253
02:03:36.227 --> 02:03:37.936
putting them in a pile.

3254
02:03:37.936 --> 02:03:41.369
"You all have to leave, pay, and then leave immediately."

3255
02:03:41.369 --> 02:03:43.761
SAM: He shouldn't be cheating on his wife:

3256
02:03:43.761 --> 02:03:45.063
Me!

3257
02:03:45.063 --> 02:03:46.017
MATT: "You two.

3258
02:03:46.017 --> 02:03:48.555
"You two are banished from the Steeple."

3259
02:03:48.555 --> 02:03:49.388
LAURA: Oh!

3260
02:03:50.579 --> 02:03:51.412
MATT: "Get them out."

3261
02:03:51.412 --> 02:03:52.245
LAURA: I... okay.

3262
02:03:52.245 --> 02:03:53.078
SAM: I'm sorry.

3263
02:03:53.078 --> 02:03:53.911
TALIESIN: For 90 days.

3264
02:03:53.911 --> 02:03:56.264
LAURA: Or just like a month maybe?

3265
02:03:56.264 --> 02:03:58.721
MATT: "Until otherwise decided."

3266
02:03:58.721 --> 02:04:01.032
SAM: There's a chance!

3267
02:04:01.032 --> 02:04:01.900
MARISHA: I linger behind.

3268
02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:02.733
LAURA: I'm healing you!

3269
02:04:02.733 --> 02:04:04.886
LIAM: Jester, Jester, pull this out!

3270
02:04:04.886 --> 02:04:05.736
LAURA: Oh, shit!

3271
02:04:05.736 --> 02:04:07.986
(laughter)

3272
02:04:08.936 --> 02:04:10.050
LAURA: Nott, here you go.

3273
02:04:10.050 --> 02:04:11.740
SAM: Thank you!

3274
02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:13.772
MATT: The side of the coat, there's just like this,

3275
02:04:13.772 --> 02:04:16.028
where the other bleeded, you know,

3276
02:04:16.028 --> 02:04:18.009
blood-soaked parts that have dried on the coat

3277
02:04:18.009 --> 02:04:20.268
from various battles, there's this one growing.

3278
02:04:20.268 --> 02:04:23.103
TRAVIS: This leopard spot.

3279
02:04:23.103 --> 02:04:25.702
MATT: You all are escorted out of the Steeple immediately.

3280
02:04:25.702 --> 02:04:27.650
LIAM: I just got this coat!

3281
02:04:27.650 --> 02:04:30.174
MATT: You do owe 250 gold for the time you spent in there.

3282
02:04:30.174 --> 02:04:32.845
MARISHA: I stay behind and I say:

3283
02:04:32.845 --> 02:04:34.786
I am so sorry, you see,

3284
02:04:34.786 --> 02:04:36.612
we've been through a lot

3285
02:04:36.612 --> 02:04:37.934
and we've seen some terrible things.

3286
02:04:37.934 --> 02:04:42.317
MATT: "I'm sure, I don't know how you do business

3287
02:04:42.317 --> 02:04:45.214
"but here, as part of the Steeple,

3288
02:04:45.214 --> 02:04:46.964
"we don't fire weapons

3289
02:04:49.147 --> 02:04:51.307
"in the middle of our research sessions."

3290
02:04:51.307 --> 02:04:52.876
MARISHA: Yes, yes, no,

3291
02:04:52.876 --> 02:04:57.151
sometimes our business

3292
02:04:57.151 --> 02:04:58.767
gets in the way of our personal life

3293
02:04:58.767 --> 02:05:01.129
and you know, it is something we are all actively--

3294
02:05:01.129 --> 02:05:02.693
MATT: "Pay and please leave."

3295
02:05:02.693 --> 02:05:04.084
MARISHA: Absolutely, yeah.

3296
02:05:04.084 --> 02:05:06.429
I give 300 gold.

3297
02:05:06.429 --> 02:05:07.262
MATT: All right.

3298
02:05:07.262 --> 02:05:12.237
MARISHA: Just maybe that extra gold will help

3299
02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:17.126
cleanse your memory of this moment.

3300
02:05:17.126 --> 02:05:19.209
MATT: "It's certainly helping."

3301
02:05:20.797 --> 02:05:23.503
MARISHA: Man, why-- fucking shit.

3302
02:05:23.503 --> 02:05:26.026
SAM: Are Fjord and the others out here or are they gone?

3303
02:05:26.026 --> 02:05:28.452
MATT: They're already, you guys are off to where?

3304
02:05:28.452 --> 02:05:29.645
TALIESIN: We're going back to--

3305
02:05:29.645 --> 02:05:32.686
MICA: Umi's house.
TALIESIN: Umi's place.

3306
02:05:32.686 --> 02:05:34.222
MATT: As you are making your way to,

3307
02:05:34.222 --> 02:05:37.369
towards the Smeltborne, Anvil of the Smeltborne,

3308
02:05:37.369 --> 02:05:38.202
we're going to go ahead and take a break.

3309
02:05:38.202 --> 02:05:40.672
ALL: Yay!

3310
02:05:40.672 --> 02:05:42.151
MATT: We'll be back here in just a few minutes

3311
02:05:42.151 --> 02:05:44.339
to pick up where we left off.

3312
02:05:44.339 --> 02:05:45.407
We do have our Wyrmwood giveaway

3313
02:05:45.407 --> 02:05:47.001
tonight, back in here.

3314
02:05:47.001 --> 02:05:49.084
Tonight we have the- ooh.

3315
02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:52.894
A favorite, return of the purpleheart dice tray.

3316
02:05:52.894 --> 02:05:55.704
The Scanlan special from Campaign 1.

3317
02:05:55.704 --> 02:05:57.535
This will be going to one lucky winner in the chat,

3318
02:05:57.535 --> 02:06:00.085
I'm so sorry about that, microphone.

3319
02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:02.458
I know. (creaking)

3320
02:06:02.458 --> 02:06:03.565
LIAM: Use your words!

3321
02:06:03.565 --> 02:06:04.875
MATT: I'm sure.

3322
02:06:04.875 --> 02:06:06.821
This will be going to one lucky winner in the chat.

3323
02:06:06.821 --> 02:06:08.793
The keyword tonight is snowfall.

3324
02:06:08.793 --> 02:06:10.376
One word, snowfall.

3325
02:06:11.255 --> 02:06:12.090
Enter it once in the chat room,

3326
02:06:12.090 --> 02:06:13.150
more than once and you'll get disqualified,

3327
02:06:13.150 --> 02:06:14.571
and once again, US and Canada only

3328
02:06:14.571 --> 02:06:16.405
excluding Quebec because of stupid laws.

3329
02:06:16.405 --> 02:06:18.943
We'll be back here shortly to tell you who the winner is.

3330
02:06:18.943 --> 02:06:19.776
See you in a minute!

3331
02:06:19.776 --> 02:06:21.443

3353
02:07:15.935 --> 02:07:20.333
a fringe, maligned, weirdo,

3354
02:07:20.333 --> 02:07:23.493
always other kind of kid,

3355
02:07:23.493 --> 02:07:26.634
and then in a band that was was always like,

3356
02:07:26.634 --> 02:07:28.285
we were the weird ones.

3357
02:07:28.285 --> 02:07:29.877
We were never cool.

3358
02:07:29.877 --> 02:07:31.134
We were the Dresden Dolls.

3359
02:07:31.134 --> 02:07:34.223
The Boston music scene hated us.

3360
02:07:34.223 --> 02:07:35.990
We were the gay mime band.

3361
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:37.361
BRIAN: Mm-hmm.

3362
02:07:37.361 --> 02:07:39.734
AMANDA: We were never invited to the party.

3363
02:07:39.734 --> 02:07:40.567
BRIAN: Yeah.

3364
02:07:40.567 --> 02:07:41.650
AMANDA: Ever.
BRIAN: Yeah.

3365
02:07:41.650 --> 02:07:44.003
AMANDA: And we were, you know, we were a posse

3366
02:07:44.003 --> 02:07:46.017
and we were like, fuck your party.

3367
02:07:46.017 --> 02:07:48.464
We have our own party.

3368
02:07:48.464 --> 02:07:51.443
A party where everything is allowed, everyone belongs.

3369
02:07:51.443 --> 02:07:53.010
We're allowed to have feelings,

3370
02:07:53.010 --> 02:07:55.255
fuck your system, fuck being cool,

3371
02:07:55.255 --> 02:07:56.480
fuck your plaid shirts.

3372
02:07:56.480 --> 02:07:57.975
We're not going to stare at our shoes.

3373
02:07:57.975 --> 02:08:01.139
We're going to look at you and be like us doing this now,

3374
02:08:01.139 --> 02:08:04.877
family, community, punk rock, here. Let's do it.

3375
02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:07.464
Have a feather boa, here's a drink,

3376
02:08:07.464 --> 02:08:08.360
let's do this shit.

3377
02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:13.277
(speakeasy music)

3378
02:08:16.877 --> 02:08:19.288
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

3379
02:08:19.288 --> 02:08:20.363
LAURA: I'm telling it like it is.

3380
02:08:20.363 --> 02:08:21.449
I don't know which camera to look at.

3381
02:08:21.449 --> 02:08:23.087
BRIAN: Look at Greg.
SAM: I'm spilling the tea.

3382
02:08:23.087 --> 02:08:25.495
LAURA: I'm spilling the tea.

3383
02:08:25.495 --> 02:08:26.959
Travis, if you're watching--

3384
02:08:26.959 --> 02:08:28.826
BRIAN: He's watching. He just Facetimed us earlier!

3385
02:08:28.826 --> 02:08:31.194
LAURA: He might be putting Ronin to bed by now.

3386
02:08:31.194 --> 02:08:35.215
But, okay, so when we were deciding our characters--

3387
02:08:35.215 --> 02:08:36.048
BRIAN: Hi, buddy!

3388
02:08:36.048 --> 02:08:37.664
Hope your night's going well, man.

3389
02:08:37.664 --> 02:08:38.671
(laughter)

3390
02:08:38.671 --> 02:08:40.755
BRIAN: Miss you and the baby.

3391
02:08:40.755 --> 02:08:42.186
He's so big!

3392
02:08:42.186 --> 02:08:43.019
LAURA: He's so cute!

3393
02:08:43.019 --> 02:08:43.918
BRIAN: Anyway, you were saying.

3394
02:08:43.918 --> 02:08:46.464
LAURA: When we were making our characters, I--

3395
02:08:46.464 --> 02:08:47.297
DANI: Oh my god.

3396
02:08:47.297 --> 02:08:48.599
LAURA: Oh god.

3397
02:08:48.599 --> 02:08:49.432
SAM: Hey!

3398
02:08:49.432 --> 02:08:51.046
(laughter)

3399
02:08:51.046 --> 02:08:51.889
DANI: It's awful!

3400
02:08:51.889 --> 02:08:53.857
SAM: Good night, Ro-ro!

3401
02:08:53.857 --> 02:08:56.513
I love you!

3402
02:08:56.513 --> 02:08:59.081
BRIAN: He's going to have nightmares

3403
02:08:59.081 --> 02:09:00.817
for the rest of his life.

3404
02:09:00.817 --> 02:09:02.380
LAURA: I hope Travis turned it off.

3405
02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:04.340
(laughter)

3406
02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:06.658
LAURA: I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry!

3407
02:09:06.658 --> 02:09:07.491
BRIAN: Lord have Mercer.

3408
02:09:07.491 --> 02:09:08.324
SAM: Is that true?

3409
02:09:08.324 --> 02:09:09.356
BRIAN: Yeah, he owns the building.

3410
02:09:09.356 --> 02:09:10.189
SAM: I did not know that!

3411
02:09:10.189 --> 02:09:11.215
BRIAN: He owns me.

3412
02:09:11.215 --> 02:09:12.619
He owns me.
SAM: Wow.

3413
02:09:12.619 --> 02:09:13.501
DANI: He owns you, Sam.

3414
02:09:13.501 --> 02:09:14.579
MATT: I have to go to his house

3415
02:09:14.579 --> 02:09:16.514
and pick up his dry cleaning after this.

3416
02:09:16.514 --> 02:09:20.440
SAM: I would love to see Matt pissed off in general,

3417
02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:21.972
but I would love to see him so pissed off

3418
02:09:21.972 --> 02:09:22.903
because I've never seen it.

3419
02:09:22.903 --> 02:09:24.153
LAURA: I've seen Matt pissed off.
BRIAN: I have.

3420
02:09:24.153 --> 02:09:26.077
SAM: That he would come in here and be like,

3421
02:09:26.077 --> 02:09:27.548
"Do you know who the fuck I am?"

3422
02:09:27.548 --> 02:09:28.381
BRIAN: Oh wow.

3423
02:09:28.381 --> 02:09:30.590
SAM: "I own all of this shit!

3424
02:09:30.590 --> 02:09:32.184
"I own that camera!

3425
02:09:32.184 --> 02:09:34.227
"I own this fucking table!

3426
02:09:34.227 --> 02:09:35.932
"Fuck you!"
(laughter)

3427
02:09:35.932 --> 02:09:38.063
BRIAN: Could you imagine, dude?

3428
02:09:38.063 --> 02:09:41.022
Oh my god, that would be the fucking day.

3429
02:09:41.022 --> 02:09:43.233
LAURA: Has anybody ever seen Matt yelling?

3430
02:09:43.233 --> 02:09:45.365
BRIAN: Matt's been pissed at me before.

3431
02:09:45.365 --> 02:09:46.443
You do not want that.

3432
02:09:46.443 --> 02:09:47.451
LAURA: I've seen him angry,

3433
02:09:47.451 --> 02:09:48.401
but I haven't seen him yelling.
BRIAN: Travis has been

3434
02:09:48.401 --> 02:09:50.375
pissed at me before. You do not want that.

3435
02:09:50.375 --> 02:09:51.406
SAM: Well, that's--

3436
02:09:51.406 --> 02:09:52.922
BRIAN: Liam...

3437
02:09:52.922 --> 02:09:56.355
has been pissed at me before.

3438
02:09:56.355 --> 02:09:58.684
But that one really bums you out.

3439
02:09:58.684 --> 02:10:00.211
BRIAN: Is Travis calling you?

3440
02:10:00.211 --> 02:10:01.044
LAURA: No.

3441
02:10:01.044 --> 02:10:02.302
BRIAN: I just texted him and asked him

3442
02:10:02.302 --> 02:10:03.927
if he stole warlock from you.

3443
02:10:03.927 --> 02:10:05.297
LAURA: You did not!

3444
02:10:05.297 --> 02:10:06.559
BRIAN: You said it on the air!

3445
02:10:06.559 --> 02:10:08.287
You accused your husband of stealing

3446
02:10:08.287 --> 02:10:10.364
the class that you wanted for this campaign!

3447
02:10:10.364 --> 02:10:12.603
This is a fucking breaking news bulletin!

3448
02:10:12.603 --> 02:10:14.535
Do we have some kind of graphic

3449
02:10:14.535 --> 02:10:16.443
for when he texts me back, Zach?

3450
02:10:16.443 --> 02:10:17.431
SAM: Do we have a breaking news?

3451
02:10:17.431 --> 02:10:19.847
BRIAN: Can we afford some sort of--

3452
02:10:19.847 --> 02:10:22.543
I have not-- I don't want to throw the crew into a--

3453
02:10:22.543 --> 02:10:23.883
All right, in the meantime, Sam,

3454
02:10:23.883 --> 02:10:26.502
while we wait for Travis to confirm.

3455
02:10:26.502 --> 02:10:27.633
SAM: I just learned--

3456
02:10:27.633 --> 02:10:28.758
BRIAN: Breaking news.
SAM: I'm not Liam O'Brien.

3457
02:10:28.758 --> 02:10:29.769
I'm not going to hijack the Twitter.

3458
02:10:29.769 --> 02:10:30.602
LAURA: I trust Liam too,

3459
02:10:30.602 --> 02:10:31.435
I don't think he's going to do that anymore.

3460
02:10:31.435 --> 02:10:32.550
TRAVIS: Breaking news, all caps.

3461
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:34.594
"I was changing Ronin."

3462
02:10:34.594 --> 02:10:36.019
LAURA: Okay.

3463
02:10:36.019 --> 02:10:36.852
SAM: Where's the graphic?

3464
02:10:36.852 --> 02:10:37.756
BRIAN: "Yes, I stole warlock."

3465
02:10:37.756 --> 02:10:39.783
(laughter)

3466
02:10:39.783 --> 02:10:40.882
BRIAN: Yes!

3467
02:10:40.882 --> 02:10:44.165
(laughter)

3468
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:47.639
SAM: Did that have music with it

3469
02:10:47.639 --> 02:10:49.447
or was it just a graphic?

3470
02:10:49.447 --> 02:10:50.960
LAURA: It's just...

3471
02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:52.377
That was amazing!

3472
02:10:53.441 --> 02:10:55.459
BRIAN: Travis confirms-- get ready, Zach.

3473
02:10:55.459 --> 02:10:58.679
Travis confirms he stole warlock.

3474
02:10:58.679 --> 02:11:01.379
(laughter)

3475
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:05.707
SAM: That just comes preloaded with the computer?

3476
02:11:05.707 --> 02:11:06.676
BRIAN: I think so!

3477
02:11:06.676 --> 02:11:11.188
Yeah, the Lenovo we're running all this off of.

3478
02:11:11.188 --> 02:11:12.323
What time do you get up usually?

3479
02:11:12.323 --> 02:11:13.181
You have kids.

3480
02:11:13.181 --> 02:11:14.880
SAM: Just like 6:45.

3481
02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:15.713
BRIAN: Yeah.

3482
02:11:15.713 --> 02:11:19.449
SAM: I try to let them sleep as late as possible,

3483
02:11:19.449 --> 02:11:22.103
so sometimes I dress them

3484
02:11:22.103 --> 02:11:24.506
while they're still in their beds in the morning,

3485
02:11:24.506 --> 02:11:27.218
just so they can lie down just for a couple extra minutes.

3486
02:11:27.218 --> 02:11:29.315
LAURA: What, that's the cutest.

3487
02:11:29.315 --> 02:11:31.528
SAM: I puT ON their little pants

3488
02:11:31.528 --> 02:11:33.299
and their little shirts and stuff

3489
02:11:33.299 --> 02:11:35.318
and while they're still under the blankies.

3490
02:11:35.318 --> 02:11:36.151
LAURA: What?

3491
02:11:36.151 --> 02:11:36.997
SAM: Yeah.

3492
02:11:36.997 --> 02:11:38.534
BRIAN: Until I was 17 years old,

3493
02:11:38.534 --> 02:11:40.080
every single morning at 5:00AM,

3494
02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:43.056
my mom would dump a cup of ice-cold water on my face

3495
02:11:43.056 --> 02:11:44.223
to wake me up.

3496
02:11:45.167 --> 02:11:47.076
SAM: That's not true.

3497
02:11:47.076 --> 02:11:48.303
BRIAN: Look how I turned out.

3498
02:11:48.303 --> 02:11:49.465
Does it seem like that's true or not?

3499
02:11:49.465 --> 02:11:50.298
SAM: It kind of does.

3500
02:11:50.298 --> 02:11:52.065
LAURA: I honestly don't know

3501
02:11:52.065 --> 02:11:53.599
BRIAN: That's the mystery.

3502
02:11:53.599 --> 02:11:54.432
That's the mystery.
LAURA: My mom woke me up

3503
02:11:54.432 --> 02:11:56.541
with a water gun if I would sleep in.

3504
02:11:56.541 --> 02:11:57.374
BRIAN: No way.

3505
02:11:57.374 --> 02:11:58.853
LAURA: Yeah, she would come in with a Super Soaker.

3506
02:11:58.853 --> 02:12:00.087
SAM: You know what I call that?

3507
02:12:00.087 --> 02:12:01.766
LAURA: Hm?
SAM: Breaking News.

3508
02:12:01.766 --> 02:12:02.940
(laughter)

3509
02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:04.190
BRIAN: Zach?

3510
02:12:05.601 --> 02:12:06.734
LAURA: He's like shit, I'm not!

3511
02:12:06.734 --> 02:12:07.693
SAM: He's like, oh fuck!

3512
02:12:07.693 --> 02:12:09.795
(stammering)

3513
02:12:09.795 --> 02:12:14.077
(laughter)

3514
02:12:14.077 --> 02:12:15.268
BRIAN: Oh fuck!

3515
02:12:15.268 --> 02:12:17.299
That was worth it.

3516
02:12:17.299 --> 02:12:20.069
That was worth it.

3517
02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:21.908
BRIAN: Scoot over a little bit, scoot over a little bit.

3518
02:12:21.908 --> 02:12:23.178
Come on, Henry.

3519
02:12:23.178 --> 02:12:25.104
Come on, Bubbas. Come on.

3520
02:12:25.104 --> 02:12:26.090
Here you go.
LAURA: Come on up!

3521
02:12:26.090 --> 02:12:27.031
BRIAN: There you go.

3522
02:12:27.031 --> 02:12:29.103
SAM: Oh, a third guest. That's nice.

3523
02:12:29.103 --> 02:12:31.822
LAURA: Oh, he's going to fart on me, isn't he?

3524
02:12:31.822 --> 02:12:33.935
BRIAN: No.

3525
02:12:33.935 --> 02:12:35.574
There we go.

3526
02:12:35.574 --> 02:12:37.124
Yeah, good boy.

3527
02:12:37.124 --> 02:12:37.957
LAURA: Thanks, Henry.

3528
02:12:37.957 --> 02:12:38.908
BRIAN: Do you want to ask a question?

3529
02:12:38.908 --> 02:12:41.988
(laughter)

3530
02:12:41.988 --> 02:12:42.821
LAURA: I love him.

3531
02:12:42.821 --> 02:12:44.335
BRIAN: He loves it up there.

3532
02:12:44.335 --> 02:12:46.447
Huh, you like to be with your auntie.

3533
02:12:46.447 --> 02:12:48.200
BRIAN: I'm looking at this picture of Ronin that Travis--

3534
02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:50.317
LAURA: Travis sent you a picture of Ronin?

3535
02:12:50.317 --> 02:12:51.439
BRIAN: Yeah, here you go, here you go.

3536
02:12:51.439 --> 02:12:52.620
LAURA: He didn't send it to me!

3537
02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:56.768
SAM: Laura is pure harp music. I would do anything for her.

3538
02:12:56.768 --> 02:12:58.037
LAURA: Look at the baby!

3539
02:12:58.037 --> 02:12:58.870
SAM: Man.

3540
02:12:58.870 --> 02:13:00.436
BRIAN: What a sweetie.

3541
02:13:00.436 --> 02:13:02.558
SAM: Oh, wait, is that breaking news?

3542
02:13:02.558 --> 02:13:03.498
BRIAN: I think it was.

3543
02:13:03.498 --> 02:13:04.954
Zach?

3544
02:13:04.954 --> 02:13:07.796
(laughter)

3545
02:13:09.478 --> 02:13:11.287
BRIAN: Zach, I'm going to need to see some of the other ones

3546
02:13:11.287 --> 02:13:13.734
that you have for future episodes of this show.

3547
02:13:13.734 --> 02:13:14.971
I think we're onto something.

3548
02:13:14.971 --> 02:13:15.804
(laughter)

3549
02:13:15.804 --> 02:13:17.468
SAM: Third down conversion!

3550
02:13:17.468 --> 02:13:18.827
(laughter)

3551
02:13:18.827 --> 02:13:20.202
SAM: Fourth attempt!

3552
02:13:20.202 --> 02:13:22.418
BRIAN: It's only football stuff.

3553
02:13:24.175 --> 02:13:27.677
TRAVIS: (southern accent) Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

3554
02:13:27.677 --> 02:13:29.424
BRIAN: Travis, holy shit,

3555
02:13:29.424 --> 02:13:31.619
what the fuck is going on?

3556
02:13:31.619 --> 02:13:33.105
Where the fuck are we, dude?

3557
02:13:33.105 --> 02:13:35.748
LIAM: ♪ Welcome to the jungle! ♪

3558
02:13:35.748 --> 02:13:38.541
♪ We got fun and games! ♪

3559
02:13:38.541 --> 02:13:40.269
♪ Sha la la la la la le! ♪

3560
02:13:40.269 --> 02:13:42.224
BRIAN: What, it's Tet'nus Terry!

3561
02:13:42.224 --> 02:13:44.389
What the hell's going on? What is this place, Tet'nus?

3562
02:13:44.389 --> 02:13:48.478
LIAM: I warped you boys here to get you away from Bast'Alar!

3563
02:13:48.478 --> 02:13:51.863
BRIAN: Oh man, my head's fucking killing me,

3564
02:13:51.863 --> 02:13:53.673
I can't remember shit.

3565
02:13:53.673 --> 02:13:55.005
LIAM: That's because I put you to sleep,

3566
02:13:55.005 --> 02:13:58.054
you ignorant, disgusting waste of blood salve.

3567
02:13:58.054 --> 02:13:59.159
BRIAN: Jesus.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3568
02:13:59.159 --> 02:14:00.424
BRIAN: Jesus.

3569
02:14:00.424 --> 02:14:02.411
Bast'Alar came out of nowhere

3570
02:14:02.411 --> 02:14:07.035
and had a creature thing called Specimen.exe.

3571
02:14:07.035 --> 02:14:08.062
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3572
02:14:08.062 --> 02:14:12.229
BRIAN: And decapitated poor T.N.Tina!

3573
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:15.096
LIAM: That he did, you disowned Olsen twin.

3574
02:14:15.096 --> 02:14:16.563
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3575
02:14:16.563 --> 02:14:19.146
LIAM: And this is just the beginning.

3576
02:14:20.292 --> 02:14:23.350
I used a little bit of extra game soul energy

3577
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:26.781
to warp you slack jaws here to the jungle ranch!

3578
02:14:26.781 --> 02:14:29.560
BRIAN: Out of all the game realms, why did you take us here?

3579
02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:31.302
This is lame compared to some of these others.

3580
02:14:31.302 --> 02:14:33.352
We got Neo Game Land--

3581
02:14:33.352 --> 02:14:34.868
LIAM: I ain't going to hear any lip about

3582
02:14:34.868 --> 02:14:37.849
where you wanted to go.

3583
02:14:37.849 --> 02:14:39.035
Now listen up!

3584
02:14:39.035 --> 02:14:44.035
Bast'Alar has made a pact with Void Tech Industries.

3585
02:14:44.393 --> 02:14:47.343
This ain't good for our endeavors, boys.

3586
02:14:47.343 --> 02:14:50.676
BRIAN: What the hell is Void Tech Industries?

3587
02:14:51.565 --> 02:14:56.164
LIAM: All right, long before the great rift shatter,

3588
02:14:56.164 --> 02:15:01.164
an evil corporation existed named Void Tech Industries.

3589
02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:03.327
They were the first mega-corp

3590
02:15:03.327 --> 02:15:06.359
to rival the power of the gods!

3591
02:15:06.359 --> 02:15:08.596
It's believed they gained access to

3592
02:15:08.596 --> 02:15:11.930
some ancient eldritch cyber-technology

3593
02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:14.279
that put them ahead of all the other corps!

3594
02:15:14.279 --> 02:15:16.755
And now that Bast'Alar is in cahoots with them,

3595
02:15:16.755 --> 02:15:20.857
his power is sure to be even more unfathomable!

3596
02:15:20.857 --> 02:15:22.943
(babbling)

3597
02:15:22.943 --> 02:15:26.112
That's why you boys need to keep playing games

3598
02:15:26.112 --> 02:15:28.801
and continue to charge up the game souls.

3599
02:15:28.801 --> 02:15:30.735
If we don't move fast, boys,

3600
02:15:30.735 --> 02:15:33.658
we may all be in grave danger

3601
02:15:33.658 --> 02:15:37.623
so pick up your sticks and let's ride, boys!

3602
02:15:37.623 --> 02:15:40.492
Sha la la le le le!

3603
02:15:40.492 --> 02:15:41.992
BRIAN: I'm not slow. I'm going as fast as

3604
02:15:41.992 --> 02:15:43.280
this motorcycle will let me,

3605
02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:46.710
but I got a bunch of freaking LA West Side

3606
02:15:46.710 --> 02:15:48.530
drivers on my ass here.

3607
02:15:48.530 --> 02:15:49.716
Hold on a second.

3608
02:15:49.716 --> 02:15:50.549
Now--

3609
02:15:51.965 --> 02:15:53.176
TRAVIS: It was so pretty!

3610
02:15:53.176 --> 02:15:54.881
BRIAN: I was about to turn the corner and--

3611
02:15:54.881 --> 02:15:56.211
TRAVIS: Show me the replay!

3612
02:15:56.211 --> 02:15:57.044
Oh my god!

3613
02:15:57.044 --> 02:15:58.202
BRIAN: We don't have instant replay.

3614
02:15:58.202 --> 02:16:01.426
TRAVIS: I incorporated a barrel roll. Oh man.

3615
02:16:01.426 --> 02:16:02.637
It's time to bust the tower.

3616
02:16:02.637 --> 02:16:04.260
BRIAN: I'm going to go see about a cheeseburger.

3617
02:16:04.260 --> 02:16:05.507
TRAVIS: Look at this. I don't even have a helmet,

3618
02:16:05.507 --> 02:16:07.415
that's how much I don't care about this scenario.

3619
02:16:07.415 --> 02:16:10.307
I'm so devil-may-care right now.

3620
02:16:10.307 --> 02:16:12.142
I have girlfriends in every city

3621
02:16:12.142 --> 02:16:15.931
because I have dope-ass hair and I can rock

3622
02:16:15.931 --> 02:16:17.181
on a dirt bike.

3623
02:16:18.497 --> 02:16:19.830
With camo pants.

3624
02:16:20.678 --> 02:16:23.352
Oh Jesus, that was a terrible slip.

3625
02:16:23.352 --> 02:16:26.585
(laughs)

3626
02:16:26.585 --> 02:16:27.904
Couldn't take the spotlight!

3627
02:16:27.904 --> 02:16:31.987
BRIAN: I got a little too low. I got a little too low.

3628
02:16:33.627 --> 02:16:34.960
TRAVIS: Where are you?

3629
02:16:36.265 --> 02:16:37.098
BRIAN: Where are you?

3630
02:16:37.098 --> 02:16:38.831
TRAVIS: Over here.
(gunshots)

3631
02:16:38.831 --> 02:16:39.772
BRIAN: No!

3632
02:16:39.772 --> 02:16:42.404
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3633
02:16:42.404 --> 02:16:44.070
BRIAN: See, that's not the objective.

3634
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.903
TRAVIS: The objective--

3635
02:16:44.903 --> 02:16:46.453
BRIAN: I was checking on a little old lady

3636
02:16:46.453 --> 02:16:48.607
who had fallen off of her dirt bike.

3637
02:16:48.607 --> 02:16:50.378
TRAVIS: I haven't seen anybody else on this map so

3638
02:16:50.378 --> 02:16:53.878
I'm wondering how that's possible.

3639
02:16:55.674 --> 02:16:56.915
(explosion)

3640
02:16:56.915 --> 02:16:57.876
(gasp)

3641
02:16:58.976 --> 02:17:00.751
(explosion)

3642
02:17:01.726 --> 02:17:03.509
(explosion)
(rapid beeping)

3643
02:17:05.443 --> 02:17:07.249
(explosion)

3644
02:17:07.249 --> 02:17:08.582
(explosion)

3645
02:17:08.582 --> 02:17:09.415
TRAVIS: Oh!

3646
02:17:10.325 --> 02:17:11.918
(explosions)

3647
02:17:11.918 --> 02:17:15.593
(screaming)
(laughter)

3648
02:17:15.593 --> 02:17:17.326
BRIAN: That's so stupid.

3649
02:17:17.326 --> 02:17:18.412
So stupid.

3650
02:17:18.412 --> 02:17:19.883
(laughter)

3651
02:17:19.883 --> 02:17:22.974
TRAVIS: Easily the best part of the game.

3652
02:17:22.974 --> 02:17:26.190
BRIAN: I was almost out of rockets.

3653
02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:27.407
Should we end it there?

3654
02:17:27.407 --> 02:17:29.842
TRAVIS: I mean, I don't know how it would get any better.

3655
02:17:29.842 --> 02:17:32.549
BRIAN: Yeah, we should probably...

3656
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:37.549
LIAM: Subscribe or don't subscribe.

3657
02:17:39.698 --> 02:17:42.506
That's not a question.

3658
02:17:43.446 --> 02:17:45.427
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

3659
02:17:45.427 --> 02:17:50.152
to ponder the prose and more prose of Twitch or Twitch Prime

3660
02:17:51.383 --> 02:17:54.177
or to take hands and gift new subs to

3661
02:17:54.177 --> 02:17:57.469
Critters who find they can't afford them.

3662
02:17:58.408 --> 02:17:59.916
To play.

3663
02:18:02.251 --> 02:18:03.959
To sleep.

3664
02:18:05.024 --> 02:18:06.774
No more.

3665
02:18:07.796 --> 02:18:11.199
And by a sleep to say the cast and crew of Crit'cal Role

3666
02:18:11.199 --> 02:18:13.972
might find their naps around the hectic schedule

3667
02:18:13.972 --> 02:18:16.766
of a live broadcast that we have brought

3668
02:18:16.766 --> 02:18:20.716
for your consumption, both Critter and fan alike.

3669
02:18:23.388 --> 02:18:26.872
To play or sleep.

3670
02:18:29.825 --> 02:18:33.892
No sleep, but just to stream.

3671
02:18:35.359 --> 02:18:37.301
Ay, there's the rub.

3672
02:18:38.199 --> 02:18:40.567
For with your subscription,

3673
02:18:40.567 --> 02:18:43.600
what streams may come.

3674
02:18:46.763 --> 02:18:49.331
Oh man oh man oh man, that is a fucking tag line.

3675
02:18:49.331 --> 02:18:51.154
Do we got that?

3676
02:18:51.154 --> 02:18:52.403
Oh.

3677
02:18:52.403 --> 02:18:54.236
That is Twitch poetry.

3678
02:18:55.090 --> 02:18:56.423
(grunts)

3679
02:18:56.423 --> 02:19:00.554
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

3680
02:19:00.554 --> 02:19:02.479
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe.

3681
02:19:02.479 --> 02:19:03.995
Gift some subscriptions.

3682
02:19:03.995 --> 02:19:06.212
You... you got it.

3683
02:19:07.255 --> 02:19:12.072
(epic music)

3684
02:31:51.945 --> 02:31:53.292
MATT: And welcome back.

3685
02:31:53.292 --> 02:31:54.710
Before we jump in,

3686
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:56.975
we do have the winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway,

3687
02:31:56.975 --> 02:31:59.387
of our fantastic Purple Heart dice tray.

3688
02:31:59.387 --> 02:32:01.739
The winner is AshenArt.

3689
02:32:01.739 --> 02:32:04.656
AshenArt, congratulations. We'll get that sent to you ASAP.

3690
02:32:04.656 --> 02:32:07.081
SAM: Sometimes I AshenArt my pants.

3691
02:32:07.081 --> 02:32:08.076
MATT: Sam, we don't need to know that.

3692
02:32:08.076 --> 02:32:09.590
SAM: Okay.

3693
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:12.441
MARISHA: I can't-- I don't know what to do!

3694
02:32:12.441 --> 02:32:13.516
LIAM: Are we going after the white dragon

3695
02:32:13.516 --> 02:32:15.074
or the fucking fly?

3696
02:32:15.074 --> 02:32:16.746
MICA: Fly. Kill it.

3697
02:32:16.746 --> 02:32:17.801
MARISHA: Priorities.

3698
02:32:17.801 --> 02:32:20.168
MATT: Either way, so.

3699
02:32:21.463 --> 02:32:25.109
As you guys exit the Steeple,

3700
02:32:25.109 --> 02:32:26.497
and make your way to find the rest of your party,

3701
02:32:26.497 --> 02:32:28.326
the rest of you have gone to go ahead

3702
02:32:28.326 --> 02:32:32.367
and meet up with Umagorn.

3703
02:32:32.367 --> 02:32:36.203
Heading back towards the Anvil of Smeltborne

3704
02:32:36.203 --> 02:32:38.505
outside of Moradin's Mantle Temple,

3705
02:32:38.505 --> 02:32:41.084
you come back to the, to you, very familiar doors

3706
02:32:41.084 --> 02:32:43.139
and the rest of you pseudo-familiar doors,

3707
02:32:43.139 --> 02:32:46.961
where you find both Deilin and Umagorn

3708
02:32:46.961 --> 02:32:48.557
are not currently at the anvil

3709
02:32:48.557 --> 02:32:50.242
but instead are sitting and eating.

3710
02:32:50.242 --> 02:32:53.186
It looks to be a spread of cured meats and some bread.

3711
02:32:53.186 --> 02:32:55.967
Very simple, just hearty foods for a hard day's work,

3712
02:32:55.967 --> 02:32:58.059
It's still that same warm interior and

3713
02:32:58.059 --> 02:33:02.236
there's still sweat across Umagorn's brow.

3714
02:33:02.236 --> 02:33:04.554
As you're sitting there eating,

3715
02:33:04.554 --> 02:33:07.987
Umagorn's talking, Deilin's nodding and signing back,

3716
02:33:07.987 --> 02:33:10.987
and as you guys enter the main chamber doors,

3717
02:33:10.987 --> 02:33:12.677
they both stop and turn and look

3718
02:33:12.677 --> 02:33:15.443
and Deilin waves a bit and Umagorn goes,

3719
02:33:15.443 --> 02:33:18.386
"Okay, you're back.

3720
02:33:18.386 --> 02:33:20.464
"Have we lost everyone already?"

3721
02:33:20.464 --> 02:33:22.690
TRAVIS: No, we're obviously trying to work

3722
02:33:22.690 --> 02:33:25.359
on a little bit of an expedited schedule.

3723
02:33:25.359 --> 02:33:27.577
We managed to stop by Ava's place

3724
02:33:27.577 --> 02:33:29.430
and pick up some mithral.

3725
02:33:29.430 --> 02:33:31.004
MATT: Oh, you got some mithral. That's nice.

3726
02:33:31.004 --> 02:33:33.260
TRAVIS: Yeah, we took whatever she had.

3727
02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:35.253
I'll take the box out of the Bag of Holding,

3728
02:33:35.253 --> 02:33:36.635
hold it up and,

3729
02:33:36.635 --> 02:33:37.925
trinkets, it looks like.

3730
02:33:37.925 --> 02:33:41.459
I don't know if perhaps we could smelt it down

3731
02:33:41.459 --> 02:33:43.786
into one piece that we could then try to--

3732
02:33:43.786 --> 02:33:46.651
MATT: "I can certainly try. Let me see it."

3733
02:33:46.651 --> 02:33:48.151
Sets it down.

3734
02:33:49.718 --> 02:33:52.201
Takes in the trinkets.

3735
02:33:52.201 --> 02:33:53.862
"Hopefully it's enough.

3736
02:33:53.862 --> 02:33:55.515
"Give me just a second. Let me try this.

3737
02:33:55.515 --> 02:33:56.649
"Deilin, if you go ahead and

3738
02:33:56.649 --> 02:33:58.436
bring the spark box for me."

3739
02:33:58.436 --> 02:34:00.100
She nods and slips over

3740
02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:02.801
and you can see behind where the forge is

3741
02:34:02.801 --> 02:34:05.779
and there's the little desk area that he has.

3742
02:34:05.779 --> 02:34:09.070
She rummages through a little side corner and,

3743
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:10.290
"Pardon me."

3744
02:34:10.290 --> 02:34:12.540
(laughs)

3745
02:34:13.572 --> 02:34:15.548
Pulls a box out and brings it over.

3746
02:34:15.548 --> 02:34:18.902
Umagorn goes ahead and grabs

3747
02:34:18.902 --> 02:34:22.671
almost like a bowl or a pot that's on a long metal handle

3748
02:34:22.671 --> 02:34:25.781
and begins placing these various knickknacks

3749
02:34:25.781 --> 02:34:27.337
and cups and everything inside of it

3750
02:34:27.337 --> 02:34:28.477
and you hear (ringing)

3751
02:34:28.477 --> 02:34:29.644
just piling up on the inside

3752
02:34:29.644 --> 02:34:33.074
until they're almost towards-- about to fall out.

3753
02:34:33.074 --> 02:34:36.884
Goes ahead and motions over to Deilin.

3754
02:34:36.884 --> 02:34:39.087
Deilin opens the box

3755
02:34:39.087 --> 02:34:41.561
and pulls out these

3756
02:34:41.561 --> 02:34:46.349
little bits of tinder crystal almost. multi-colored,

3757
02:34:46.349 --> 02:34:48.941
and she scatters them across the fire of the forge.

3758
02:34:48.941 --> 02:34:51.720
The forge flares up brighter

3759
02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:54.340
in almost a multi-color flare.

3760
02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:57.409
He immediately takes and turns and puts it over in the fire

3761
02:34:57.409 --> 02:34:59.196
and the heat in the room almost doubles.

3762
02:34:59.196 --> 02:35:01.094
It's like, yeah, so they take a few steps back.

3763
02:35:01.094 --> 02:35:03.074
It becomes almost unbearable.

3764
02:35:03.074 --> 02:35:05.060
As he holds it there in the flames

3765
02:35:05.060 --> 02:35:07.154
themself stoked by whatever material

3766
02:35:07.154 --> 02:35:08.515
that Deilin threw into it,

3767
02:35:08.515 --> 02:35:11.674
you watch as they slowly begin to soften

3768
02:35:11.674 --> 02:35:14.933
and fold into this pot.

3769
02:35:14.933 --> 02:35:17.614
Eventually, pulling it out

3770
02:35:17.614 --> 02:35:22.597
after it seems to melt into a molten metal form.

3771
02:35:24.864 --> 02:35:26.088
He gives a nod to Deilin.

3772
02:35:26.088 --> 02:35:30.299
"Uh, bring over the ingot mold."

3773
02:35:30.299 --> 02:35:34.861
She brings over and sets down this piece of dark metal

3774
02:35:34.861 --> 02:35:37.726
that has grooves in it and a central piece

3775
02:35:37.726 --> 02:35:42.677
where a rectangular recess is placed within it.

3776
02:35:42.677 --> 02:35:45.639
He turns it and begins pouring it into the edges

3777
02:35:45.639 --> 02:35:47.443
and as it merges down and begins to fill,

3778
02:35:47.443 --> 02:35:49.749
you see now the liquid mithral

3779
02:35:49.749 --> 02:35:53.949
fill up to just about where it

3780
02:35:53.949 --> 02:35:55.628
reaches the top of this mold.

3781
02:35:55.628 --> 02:35:57.023
He turns it back and looks inside.

3782
02:35:57.023 --> 02:35:59.956
"Oh. You've actually got some extra, it looks like.

3783
02:35:59.956 --> 02:36:01.649
"You did good.

3784
02:36:03.437 --> 02:36:05.924
"Go ahead and give me that mold there."

3785
02:36:05.924 --> 02:36:06.757
And Deilin passes over

3786
02:36:06.757 --> 02:36:09.115
and he pours the rest into the smaller mold.

3787
02:36:09.115 --> 02:36:12.386
He says, "Well, I'll set that aside for the time be, but..."

3788
02:36:12.386 --> 02:36:15.929
He sets down the pot, takes the mold,

3789
02:36:15.929 --> 02:36:16.995
but with a pair of tongs,

3790
02:36:16.995 --> 02:36:20.416
and then sets it carefully into a trough of water that

3791
02:36:20.416 --> 02:36:25.030
(hisses) steams around the materials before bringing it up,

3792
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:27.688
turning over and banging the mold

3793
02:36:27.688 --> 02:36:30.138
across the edge of the forge until suddenly,

3794
02:36:30.138 --> 02:36:31.004
(ringing)

3795
02:36:31.004 --> 02:36:35.745
this bar of solid mithral there sits before you.

3796
02:36:35.745 --> 02:36:38.755
He goes, "(sighs)

3797
02:36:38.755 --> 02:36:40.145
"This is going to be warm in here for a bit.

3798
02:36:40.145 --> 02:36:42.142
"Let's step outside, but

3799
02:36:42.142 --> 02:36:45.151
"looks like you got enough maybe to work with. That's good.

3800
02:36:45.151 --> 02:36:46.234
"Good running."

3801
02:36:47.457 --> 02:36:48.966
He goes ahead and takes the tongs,

3802
02:36:48.966 --> 02:36:51.107
takes the bar, and you all step out,

3803
02:36:51.107 --> 02:36:53.125
just outside of the forge.

3804
02:36:53.125 --> 02:36:54.785
He's looking over.

3805
02:36:54.785 --> 02:36:57.501
"This, a few imperfections,

3806
02:36:57.501 --> 02:36:59.998
"but those can be hammered out.

3807
02:36:59.998 --> 02:37:01.172
"This'll do. This'll do.

3808
02:37:01.172 --> 02:37:02.980
"Hopefully.

3809
02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:04.665
"The hard part's up to you."

3810
02:37:04.665 --> 02:37:06.840
TRAVIS: Ideally, we would take this entire piece

3811
02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:10.957
and cover it in iceflex

3812
02:37:10.957 --> 02:37:12.198
from a white dragon.

3813
02:37:12.198 --> 02:37:13.531
MATT: "Supposedly."

3814
02:37:13.531 --> 02:37:15.424
TRAVIS: Right.

3815
02:37:15.424 --> 02:37:18.799
Okay, no problem there.

3816
02:37:19.797 --> 02:37:20.818
MATT: "Hold on a second."

3817
02:37:20.818 --> 02:37:22.984
He hands you-- at the end of the tongs, the bar,

3818
02:37:22.984 --> 02:37:24.329
and you're a little reticent at first,

3819
02:37:24.329 --> 02:37:25.390
afraid that maybe it's still hot,

3820
02:37:25.390 --> 02:37:26.553
but it's cold to your touch

3821
02:37:26.553 --> 02:37:28.333
and it's lighter than you anticipated.

3822
02:37:28.333 --> 02:37:30.769
For it being a solid metal, mithral,

3823
02:37:30.769 --> 02:37:32.650
is known for, not only its strength but

3824
02:37:32.650 --> 02:37:35.355
it's very, very lightweight compared with other materials

3825
02:37:35.355 --> 02:37:37.030
so it's surprising

3826
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:39.051
when the heft is placed in your palm.

3827
02:37:39.051 --> 02:37:39.890
He steps out, comes back with

3828
02:37:39.890 --> 02:37:41.965
that same notebook that he had previously,

3829
02:37:41.965 --> 02:37:43.968
that outlined the process

3830
02:37:43.968 --> 02:37:47.562
in which he was refining the blade

3831
02:37:47.562 --> 02:37:50.395
and then looks up and goes,

3832
02:37:50.395 --> 02:37:53.792
"Well, it says here for iceflex,

3833
02:37:53.792 --> 02:37:58.792
"there's actual change in hue to the metal.

3834
02:37:58.854 --> 02:38:00.656
"That's when you'll know.

3835
02:38:00.656 --> 02:38:02.084
"I don't know what that means,

3836
02:38:02.084 --> 02:38:04.024
"but I guess you got to keep an eye."

3837
02:38:04.024 --> 02:38:05.304
TRAVIS: Right.

3838
02:38:05.304 --> 02:38:07.455
Is there any sense to attaching this

3839
02:38:07.455 --> 02:38:10.744
to the front of a shield or something that might be

3840
02:38:10.744 --> 02:38:13.345
in the direct path of dragon's breath?

3841
02:38:13.345 --> 02:38:14.281
MATT: "That sounds a lot safer than

3842
02:38:14.281 --> 02:38:15.701
"maybe holding it up with your hand."

3843
02:38:15.701 --> 02:38:16.642
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3844
02:38:16.642 --> 02:38:17.475
TALIESIN: Huh.

3845
02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:21.602
TRAVIS: I do have a shield. It's rather plain.

3846
02:38:21.602 --> 02:38:25.129
MATT: "I mean, preferably, however you get this done,

3847
02:38:25.129 --> 02:38:30.009
"you're not anywhere near the bar when this happens."

3848
02:38:30.009 --> 02:38:32.676
TRAVIS: If only that were true.

3849
02:38:32.676 --> 02:38:35.626
Yes, I'm sure we'll come up with something.

3850
02:38:35.626 --> 02:38:36.661
Any ideas?

3851
02:38:36.661 --> 02:38:39.890
MATT: "I hope so."
TALIESIN: Definitely will.

3852
02:38:39.890 --> 02:38:43.907
It's just a matter of getting there and getting back.

3853
02:38:43.907 --> 02:38:45.210
MATT: "Don't be foolish.

3854
02:38:45.210 --> 02:38:47.382
"Where are you going, did you figure out--?"

3855
02:38:47.382 --> 02:38:48.940
TRAVIS: Yes, actually--

3856
02:38:48.940 --> 02:38:51.036
Nope, nope, we don't-- we don't know

3857
02:38:51.036 --> 02:38:52.952
that info. We were not in there.

3858
02:38:52.952 --> 02:38:53.918
(laughter)

3859
02:38:53.918 --> 02:38:56.935
TRAVIS: That was after we left.

3860
02:38:58.649 --> 02:39:01.184
I'm sure our comrades have come up with something.

3861
02:39:01.184 --> 02:39:02.478
MATT: "Right.

3862
02:39:02.478 --> 02:39:03.795
"Good luck.

3863
02:39:03.795 --> 02:39:06.353
"Just be smart.

3864
02:39:06.353 --> 02:39:08.516
"Dragons are...

3865
02:39:08.516 --> 02:39:11.858
"...kind of feared historically for a reason."

3866
02:39:11.858 --> 02:39:12.691
TALIESIN: Really?

3867
02:39:15.431 --> 02:39:16.810
MATT: "Are you going with these yahoos?"

3868
02:39:16.810 --> 02:39:18.111
MICA: Uh-huh.

3869
02:39:18.111 --> 02:39:19.803
MATT: "Really?"
MICA: Uh-huh!

3870
02:39:19.803 --> 02:39:21.872
Come on, it's a white dragon.

3871
02:39:21.872 --> 02:39:24.297
MATT: "I know that."
MICA: Yeah!

3872
02:39:26.193 --> 02:39:28.177
I won't die, I promise,

3873
02:39:28.177 --> 02:39:30.717
and I'll make sure that they won't die, probably,

3874
02:39:30.717 --> 02:39:32.582
and I'm going to come back and am going to give you

3875
02:39:32.582 --> 02:39:34.465
a scale of a dragon and you can hang it up

3876
02:39:34.465 --> 02:39:37.798
and it's going to be a cool keepsake, okay? Promise.

3877
02:39:39.944 --> 02:39:43.270
MATT: It's not the first time you've made that promise."

3878
02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:44.697
MICA: Have I died yet?

3879
02:39:44.697 --> 02:39:46.874
MATT: "No, but you've come back pretty bruised and beaten."

3880
02:39:46.874 --> 02:39:48.982
MICA: But have I died?

3881
02:39:48.982 --> 02:39:51.648
MATT: "Not yet, but each time you're pushing your luck.

3882
02:39:51.648 --> 02:39:52.877
"Look.

3883
02:39:52.877 --> 02:39:56.105
"You know how many strange travelers, mercenaries,

3884
02:39:56.105 --> 02:39:59.436
"make their way across this place looking to find glory

3885
02:39:59.436 --> 02:40:00.978
"and they're never seen again.

3886
02:40:00.978 --> 02:40:03.117
"Just don't be one of them, please."

3887
02:40:03.117 --> 02:40:05.258
MICA: It's not glory. It's a dragon.

3888
02:40:05.258 --> 02:40:06.404
I'll be fine.

3889
02:40:06.404 --> 02:40:08.629
TRAVIS: Does Umi know about your--

3890
02:40:08.629 --> 02:40:09.862
MATT: "Umagorn."

3891
02:40:09.862 --> 02:40:10.695
MICA: Umi.

3892
02:40:10.695 --> 02:40:11.564
TRAVIS: Oh, yes.

3893
02:40:11.564 --> 02:40:12.921
MATT: "Only she calls me--"

3894
02:40:12.921 --> 02:40:14.190
TRAVIS: I apologize, my fault.

3895
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:16.257
My mistake, sorry.

3896
02:40:17.187 --> 02:40:19.313
Does he know about your secret?

3897
02:40:19.313 --> 02:40:21.362
MICA: Yeah, he's one of the first people I told.

3898
02:40:21.362 --> 02:40:23.528
Well, not told, I messed up.

3899
02:40:23.528 --> 02:40:25.516
He caught me changing back.

3900
02:40:25.516 --> 02:40:27.896
But that was a while ago, it's fine now.

3901
02:40:27.896 --> 02:40:29.127
He knows.

3902
02:40:29.127 --> 02:40:31.406
MATT: "They know about Ivae'ess?"
MICA: Yeah.

3903
02:40:31.406 --> 02:40:32.737
MATT: "You got to stop telling people about this!"

3904
02:40:32.737 --> 02:40:34.096
MICA: Well, they seem nice!

3905
02:40:34.096 --> 02:40:36.096
MATT: "It's not a good secret to keep you safe

3906
02:40:36.096 --> 02:40:37.162
if you're not keeping it a secret."

3907
02:40:37.162 --> 02:40:38.448
MICA: They're not going to--

3908
02:40:38.448 --> 02:40:40.453
If they tell, I'll kill them.

3909
02:40:40.453 --> 02:40:41.898
See.

3910
02:40:41.898 --> 02:40:43.646
MATT: "We got to talk about that, too.

3911
02:40:43.646 --> 02:40:45.636
"You've got a very hard line here.

3912
02:40:45.636 --> 02:40:46.830
"It's going to put you in trouble."

3913
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:48.388
TRAVIS: Fatal threats and revealing secrets

3914
02:40:48.388 --> 02:40:50.379
in the first day. It's a lot.

3915
02:40:50.379 --> 02:40:53.243
TALIESIN: I think it's a refreshing change of pace.

3916
02:40:53.243 --> 02:40:57.713
MICA: What if I bring you back <i>two</i> dragon scales?

3917
02:40:57.713 --> 02:40:59.403
MATT: "I mean if you're going for it, bring me back many,

3918
02:40:59.403 --> 02:41:02.545
"but only if it's easy and it's dead.

3919
02:41:02.545 --> 02:41:05.009
"Otherwise, don't.

3920
02:41:05.009 --> 02:41:06.759
"And by the way, don't kill it.

3921
02:41:06.759 --> 02:41:08.470
"Don't try to kill it.

3922
02:41:08.470 --> 02:41:10.303
"It's a fucking dragon."

3923
02:41:11.647 --> 02:41:14.886
MICA: But what if I want to kill it?

3924
02:41:14.886 --> 02:41:17.789
What if Samliel tells me to kill it?

3925
02:41:17.789 --> 02:41:19.785
Then can I kill it?

3926
02:41:19.785 --> 02:41:21.667
I'm going to take that as a yes.

3927
02:41:21.667 --> 02:41:22.504
MATT: "No.

3928
02:41:22.504 --> 02:41:24.149
"No, don't take that as a yes.

3929
02:41:24.149 --> 02:41:26.903
"That was just me exhibiting my frustration.

3930
02:41:26.903 --> 02:41:28.401
"That wasn't an answer.

3931
02:41:28.401 --> 02:41:31.886
"That was a form of social expression."

3932
02:41:31.886 --> 02:41:33.985
MICA: Which I'll take as a yes.
MATT: (frustrated groan)

3933
02:41:33.985 --> 02:41:35.946
TRAVIS: We will keep her safe, as neither of us

3934
02:41:35.946 --> 02:41:38.060
wish to die in this endeavor.

3935
02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:39.818
MATT: "Right."
MICA: They get it!

3936
02:41:39.818 --> 02:41:40.651
MATT: "Look at that."

3937
02:41:40.651 --> 02:41:42.022
TRAVIS: We should be returning to our friends.

3938
02:41:42.022 --> 02:41:43.552
Thank you for your help.

3939
02:41:43.552 --> 02:41:47.856
We'll be back, hopefully sooner rather than later.

3940
02:41:47.856 --> 02:41:50.710
MATT: "All right, I'll be here finishing my orders.

3941
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:51.543
"Be careful."

3942
02:41:51.543 --> 02:41:52.793
MICA: Bye, Umi!

3943
02:41:53.901 --> 02:41:54.944
MATT: "Bye, Reani."

3944
02:41:54.944 --> 02:41:56.410
TRAVIS: Did we say were going to try to meet them

3945
02:41:56.410 --> 02:41:59.093
at our lodgings or outside of the archive?

3946
02:41:59.093 --> 02:42:00.826
TALIESIN: We were very unspecific about

3947
02:42:00.826 --> 02:42:01.776
where we were going to meet.

3948
02:42:01.776 --> 02:42:03.818
MATT: They also followed about a half an hour after,

3949
02:42:03.818 --> 02:42:05.972
so we'll say for the purposes of ease,

3950
02:42:05.972 --> 02:42:08.754
eventually stumbling around, you manage to cross paths.

3951
02:42:08.754 --> 02:42:10.142
Plus they have Sending in their disposal,

3952
02:42:10.142 --> 02:42:12.313
so it wouldn't be too hard.

3953
02:42:12.313 --> 02:42:15.230
Eventually you guys do meet up once more.

3954
02:42:15.230 --> 02:42:19.400
TRAVIS: We have a new single bar of mithral.

3955
02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:21.934
MARISHA: And we have information on a dragon.

3956
02:42:21.934 --> 02:42:23.088
TRAVIS: You do?

3957
02:42:23.088 --> 02:42:24.391
MARISHA: Gelidon.

3958
02:42:24.391 --> 02:42:25.791
He's--

3959
02:42:25.791 --> 02:42:27.655
fucking far.

3960
02:42:27.655 --> 02:42:28.488
TRAVIS: Oh.

3961
02:42:28.488 --> 02:42:31.092
LAURA: Is 100 year-old dragon an old dragon

3962
02:42:31.092 --> 02:42:33.693
or is it a new dragon. What do you guys think?

3963
02:42:33.693 --> 02:42:36.308
MARISHA: I would know that based on reading.

3964
02:42:36.308 --> 02:42:37.608
MATT: From what you read, it said that

3965
02:42:37.608 --> 02:42:38.941
he hadn't been <i>seen</i> in 100 years.

3966
02:42:38.941 --> 02:42:40.839
LIAM: <i>Seen</i> in 100-- he's way older.

3967
02:42:40.839 --> 02:42:41.700
Probably.

3968
02:42:41.700 --> 02:42:43.323
LAURA: I mean, maybe.

3969
02:42:43.323 --> 02:42:45.720
SAM: He's at least 101.

3970
02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:47.043
(laughter)

3971
02:42:47.043 --> 02:42:48.800
MARISHA: Did I get any information on

3972
02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:51.262
how long this myth has been around?

3973
02:42:51.262 --> 02:42:53.762
MATT: The myth has been around for

3974
02:42:55.319 --> 02:42:59.361
maybe close to two to 250 years.

3975
02:42:59.361 --> 02:43:01.607
MARISHA: 250 or something.

3976
02:43:01.607 --> 02:43:03.625
Oh!
MATT: Almost!

3977
02:43:03.625 --> 02:43:04.950
Curse the spiritual weapon!

3978
02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:06.700
LIAM: This is the show.

3979
02:43:07.605 --> 02:43:10.518
SAM: It's just going from cup to cup.
LAURA: Wait, wait!

3980
02:43:10.518 --> 02:43:12.980
Clap above it! You have to clap above it.

3981
02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:15.019
I learned it from Steve Carell.

3982
02:43:15.019 --> 02:43:16.457
Clap above it, clap above it.

3983
02:43:16.457 --> 02:43:18.026
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah, where it's going to go.

3984
02:43:18.026 --> 02:43:19.068
LIAM: Boom!

3985
02:43:19.068 --> 02:43:20.843
LAURA: He was so close. He was so close!

3986
02:43:20.843 --> 02:43:22.026
MARISHA: What do you mean clap above it?

3987
02:43:22.026 --> 02:43:23.126
LAURA: Clap above where it goes.

3988
02:43:23.126 --> 02:43:23.989
Get it, baby.

3989
02:43:23.989 --> 02:43:24.888
(clap)

3990
02:43:24.888 --> 02:43:28.888
(cheering)

3991
02:43:31.252 --> 02:43:32.694
MARISHA: Amazing!

3992
02:43:33.764 --> 02:43:35.347
MICA: That was amazing!

3993
02:43:36.638 --> 02:43:38.775
TALIESIN: Let the bread and circuses commence!

3994
02:43:38.775 --> 02:43:40.073
(laughter)

3995
02:43:40.073 --> 02:43:42.076
MATT: We can just end the game there tonight, guys.

3996
02:43:42.076 --> 02:43:45.143
We're not getting any better than that.

3997
02:43:45.143 --> 02:43:46.662
LIAM: That dragon ain't shit!

3998
02:43:46.662 --> 02:43:47.813
(laughter)

3999
02:43:47.813 --> 02:43:50.179
MATT: After an obnoxiously long period of time

4000
02:43:50.179 --> 02:43:53.702
of being harried by some sort of subterranean insect,

4001
02:43:53.702 --> 02:43:55.342
Fjord snatches it from the air

4002
02:43:55.342 --> 02:43:57.942
just as the rest of the party catches up.

4003
02:43:57.942 --> 02:44:00.710
TRAVIS: Should have lost my powers years ago!

4004
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:02.585
(laughter)

4005
02:44:02.585 --> 02:44:04.858
TRAVIS: That is incredible!

4006
02:44:04.858 --> 02:44:06.739
LIAM: All your other senses are heightening.

4007
02:44:06.739 --> 02:44:09.271
(laughter)

4008
02:44:09.271 --> 02:44:10.921
TRAVIS: Beau, did you see?

4009
02:44:10.921 --> 02:44:14.110
I think you should teach me some shit, I'm just saying.

4010
02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:15.186
MARISHA: Who are you talking--

4011
02:44:15.186 --> 02:44:16.848
LAURA: We just caught up.

4012
02:44:16.848 --> 02:44:18.649
SAM: Hey, so...

4013
02:44:18.649 --> 02:44:20.350
LIAM: How far away are we talking about?

4014
02:44:20.350 --> 02:44:22.019
SAM: 350 miles!

4015
02:44:22.019 --> 02:44:23.912
MICA: That's just a slight trek up the hill.

4016
02:44:23.912 --> 02:44:25.766
That's fine, we can do it.

4017
02:44:25.766 --> 02:44:27.872
SAM: Can you transport long distances?

4018
02:44:27.872 --> 02:44:29.173
MICA: No, I can walk.

4019
02:44:29.173 --> 02:44:31.330
SAM: Oh.
TRAVIS: Right.

4020
02:44:31.330 --> 02:44:32.488
Yes.

4021
02:44:32.488 --> 02:44:36.676
MATT: So 350 miles, looking at the map that you have,

4022
02:44:36.676 --> 02:44:38.884
and there's a few options here.

4023
02:44:38.884 --> 02:44:40.467
LIAM: Hold it up high, Travis.

4024
02:44:40.467 --> 02:44:43.687
MICA: Hit him in the face. Hit him in the face!

4025
02:44:43.687 --> 02:44:45.187
MATT: All right, so--

4026
02:44:46.291 --> 02:44:48.110
MARISHA: I can feel your twitchiness.

4027
02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:49.687
I can feel it.

4028
02:44:49.687 --> 02:44:52.272
MICA: Hit him in the chest!
LAURA: Don't do it!

4029
02:44:52.272 --> 02:44:56.213
MATT: On foot, through the mountains,

4030
02:44:56.213 --> 02:44:57.839
you're looking at 18 days of travel.

4031
02:44:57.839 --> 02:44:59.314
LAURA: What?

4032
02:45:00.257 --> 02:45:02.711
MATT: However, on goatback--

4033
02:45:02.711 --> 02:45:03.893
SAM: Goatback?

4034
02:45:03.893 --> 02:45:05.247
MATT: Because you see goats,

4035
02:45:05.247 --> 02:45:06.080
on the way in.

4036
02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:08.799
These very very large goats.
SAM: Goatback Mountain.

4037
02:45:08.799 --> 02:45:11.796
MATT: That's a whole different campaign.

4038
02:45:11.796 --> 02:45:13.459
That's 12 days.

4039
02:45:13.459 --> 02:45:15.493
SAM: That's still a fuck ton of days.

4040
02:45:15.493 --> 02:45:17.197
MATT: If you go through the Rime Plains,

4041
02:45:17.197 --> 02:45:19.604
which is underneath the mountains,

4042
02:45:19.604 --> 02:45:21.737
you're looking at 15 days of foot travel,

4043
02:45:21.737 --> 02:45:23.487
10 days on horseback.

4044
02:45:24.709 --> 02:45:25.612
LAURA: Okay.

4045
02:45:25.612 --> 02:45:27.288
Are there horses here?

4046
02:45:27.288 --> 02:45:29.857
MATT: They do have some Wildemount horses as well.

4047
02:45:29.857 --> 02:45:31.863
LAURA: Man, I wish we had our moorbounders, you guys.

4048
02:45:31.863 --> 02:45:34.244
MATT: The downside of the Rime Plains is it's--

4049
02:45:34.244 --> 02:45:36.490
you're in open plains so you're much more visible

4050
02:45:36.490 --> 02:45:39.098
as opposed to mountain travel, so the choice is yours.

4051
02:45:39.098 --> 02:45:41.897
SAM: Or, I'm just throwing this out there,

4052
02:45:41.897 --> 02:45:44.784
Reani, how would you feel about doing that

4053
02:45:44.784 --> 02:45:47.944
much-easier-to-handle caper that's in town

4054
02:45:47.944 --> 02:45:52.559
where we go and get the red ring back from the Tumblecarves

4055
02:45:52.559 --> 02:45:53.923
or whatever their names were?

4056
02:45:53.923 --> 02:45:55.225
LAURA: No, we need to kill a dragon.

4057
02:45:55.225 --> 02:45:58.713
SAM: I know, but that's like a month-long ordeal.

4058
02:45:58.713 --> 02:46:01.874
LAURA: No, it doesn't have to be. You guys!

4059
02:46:01.874 --> 02:46:04.044
SAM: Let Reani answer my question.

4060
02:46:04.044 --> 02:46:05.484
Is that evil or good?

4061
02:46:05.484 --> 02:46:09.637
Stealing back a ring that was illegally taken?

4062
02:46:09.637 --> 02:46:12.056
MICA: Samliel hasn't gotten back to me on that one.

4063
02:46:12.056 --> 02:46:13.586
SAM: We got to sleep.

4064
02:46:13.586 --> 02:46:16.903
MICA: But I know I have to see a dragon.

4065
02:46:19.116 --> 02:46:21.282
SAM: Even if it takes us two months?

4066
02:46:21.282 --> 02:46:23.257
LAURA: This is what I'm saying, it won't.

4067
02:46:23.257 --> 02:46:25.097
TALIESIN: That's a long-- yeah.

4068
02:46:25.097 --> 02:46:27.105
LAURA: Why aren't you listening to my idea?

4069
02:46:27.105 --> 02:46:28.608
SAM: What's your idea?

4070
02:46:28.608 --> 02:46:29.479
LAURA: Caleb--

4071
02:46:29.479 --> 02:46:30.438
LIAM: Yeah?

4072
02:46:30.438 --> 02:46:33.520
LAURA: You take us all home to Xhorhas.

4073
02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:35.075
We talk to Essek.

4074
02:46:35.075 --> 02:46:37.483
He transports us to the mountain.

4075
02:46:37.483 --> 02:46:38.813
We kill a dragon.

4076
02:46:38.813 --> 02:46:42.460
And you can use your circle and take us back to Xhorhas

4077
02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:44.291
when we need to go.

4078
02:46:44.291 --> 02:46:46.131
TRAVIS: But we need to come back here.

4079
02:46:46.131 --> 02:46:47.289
LAURA: Well, then we talk to Essek

4080
02:46:47.289 --> 02:46:49.030
and he bamfs us back here.

4081
02:46:49.030 --> 02:46:51.942
TALIESIN: A lot of bamfing.
TRAVIS: Involves a lot of Essek.

4082
02:46:51.942 --> 02:46:52.917
TALIESIN: Is it possible there's already

4083
02:46:52.917 --> 02:46:54.081
a circle where we're going?

4084
02:46:54.081 --> 02:46:55.242
Could we talk to someone?

4085
02:46:55.242 --> 02:46:56.775
MARISHA: There might also be a circle here.

4086
02:46:56.775 --> 02:46:58.390
There's got to be a circle here.

4087
02:46:58.390 --> 02:47:01.037
LAURA: There's got to be a circle here. There's elves here.

4088
02:47:01.037 --> 02:47:05.887
MARISHA: It's just who, and who doesn't hate us yet.

4089
02:47:05.887 --> 02:47:07.986
LAURA: I could send a message to Essek

4090
02:47:07.986 --> 02:47:09.513
and see if he would do it.

4091
02:47:09.513 --> 02:47:11.567
TRAVIS: Plus the archive I'm sure is friendly,

4092
02:47:11.567 --> 02:47:13.312
we've left that in good--

4093
02:47:13.312 --> 02:47:14.844
LAURA: Ooh--
MICA: Oh--

4094
02:47:14.844 --> 02:47:17.326
SAM: Chaos crew kind fucked that up.

4095
02:47:17.326 --> 02:47:18.426
LAURA: Yes, Reani?

4096
02:47:18.426 --> 02:47:19.558
MICA: Hello?
LIAM: Reani.

4097
02:47:19.558 --> 02:47:20.901
MICA: Did somebody say you need an elf

4098
02:47:20.901 --> 02:47:22.309
that doesn't hate you?

4099
02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:23.142
SAM: Yes.

4100
02:47:23.142 --> 02:47:25.130
LAURA: Somebody that's powerfully magical.

4101
02:47:25.130 --> 02:47:26.792
MICA: Oh no, nevermind, then.

4102
02:47:26.792 --> 02:47:27.677
SAM: What were you going to say?

4103
02:47:27.677 --> 02:47:29.326
MICA: I just know a nice elf.

4104
02:47:29.326 --> 02:47:30.787
SAM: Who's that?

4105
02:47:30.787 --> 02:47:31.767
MICA: She works for the Glassblades

4106
02:47:31.767 --> 02:47:33.325
and we could visit her and ask.

4107
02:47:33.325 --> 02:47:35.775
LAURA: Ooh, the Glassblades.

4108
02:47:35.775 --> 02:47:37.974
They might have access to something.

4109
02:47:37.974 --> 02:47:38.858
SAM: Yeah.

4110
02:47:38.858 --> 02:47:40.232
MICA: You said elf.

4111
02:47:40.232 --> 02:47:41.065
SAM: Yeah.

4112
02:47:41.065 --> 02:47:42.418
Yeah, we could.

4113
02:47:42.418 --> 02:47:44.159
MICA: Why do we need elves?

4114
02:47:44.159 --> 02:47:46.266
TALIESIN: Well, they tend to--
LAURA: Be very magical.

4115
02:47:46.266 --> 02:47:48.702
TALIESIN: --have access to maybe intricate magics,

4116
02:47:48.702 --> 02:47:50.960
especially teleportation spells.

4117
02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:53.635
MARISHA: Yeah, we were basically totally being biased

4118
02:47:53.635 --> 02:47:56.809
on the former stereotypes that we've known.

4119
02:47:56.809 --> 02:47:58.191
MICA: That's valid.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4120
02:47:58.191 --> 02:47:59.316
MICA: Okay.

4121
02:48:00.410 --> 02:48:04.478
SAM: We could use your magical paint

4122
02:48:04.478 --> 02:48:06.648
and make a hot air balloon.

4123
02:48:06.648 --> 02:48:08.140
TALIESIN: That's a lot of paint.

4124
02:48:08.140 --> 02:48:09.271
LAURA: That is a lot of paint,

4125
02:48:09.271 --> 02:48:12.521
but I think I might have enough for it.

4126
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:17.725
MATT: It would use most of your paint, but it's possible.

4127
02:48:17.725 --> 02:48:19.756
LAURA: All of the paint.

4128
02:48:19.756 --> 02:48:22.978
And then we could get shot down pretty easy.

4129
02:48:22.978 --> 02:48:24.854
TRAVIS: Also, do you have any experience

4130
02:48:24.854 --> 02:48:26.979
piloting a hot air balloon?

4131
02:48:26.979 --> 02:48:29.068
SAM: Nope, never seen or heard of one.

4132
02:48:29.068 --> 02:48:32.086
(laughter)

4133
02:48:32.086 --> 02:48:33.652
TRAVIS: I was wondering.

4134
02:48:33.652 --> 02:48:34.950
(laughter)

4135
02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:37.059
TALIESIN: Just throwing a bunch of words together.

4136
02:48:37.059 --> 02:48:38.292
MARISHA: Wait, Nott,

4137
02:48:38.292 --> 02:48:40.908
did you just invent the hot air balloon?

4138
02:48:40.908 --> 02:48:42.157
SAM: Canon.
LIAM: Canon.

4139
02:48:42.157 --> 02:48:46.222
(laughter)

4140
02:48:46.222 --> 02:48:48.798
SAM: It just seems like hot air trapped

4141
02:48:48.798 --> 02:48:53.339
in some sort of container could rise up and be able to--

4142
02:48:53.339 --> 02:48:54.704
TALIESIN: Why?

4143
02:48:54.704 --> 02:48:56.179
It's just thermodynamics.

4144
02:48:56.179 --> 02:48:58.479
TALIESIN: I don't-- what? The--

4145
02:48:58.479 --> 02:49:00.015
SAM: Hot air wants to rise.

4146
02:49:00.015 --> 02:49:00.848
TALIESIN: Does it?

4147
02:49:00.848 --> 02:49:03.702
TRAVIS: There's dunamancy and then there's thermodynamics.

4148
02:49:03.702 --> 02:49:06.733
MARISHA: Somewhere, Percy is having a nosebleed.

4149
02:49:06.733 --> 02:49:08.066
TALIESIN: I know.

4150
02:49:09.625 --> 02:49:13.602
TRAVIS: We should certainly explore the Glassblade option.

4151
02:49:13.602 --> 02:49:16.360
In any case, there is someone that has--

4152
02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:18.607
TALIESIN: What an exciting opportunity

4153
02:49:18.607 --> 02:49:20.789
to make more friends and/or enemies.

4154
02:49:20.789 --> 02:49:22.860
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4155
02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:24.528
MARISHA: Schrodinger's friend.

4156
02:49:24.528 --> 02:49:25.844
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4157
02:49:25.844 --> 02:49:27.694
MARISHA: Something else I invented!

4158
02:49:28.531 --> 02:49:29.757
The philosopher.

4159
02:49:29.757 --> 02:49:31.291
TALIESIN: He's the guy who invented cheese on the moon.

4160
02:49:31.291 --> 02:49:33.473
LIAM: Beauregard Schrodinger Lionett.

4161
02:49:33.473 --> 02:49:35.106
SAM: All right, let's go see your Glassblade.

4162
02:49:35.106 --> 02:49:36.840
MARISHA: Canon.

4163
02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:38.101
SAM: What's his or her name?

4164
02:49:38.101 --> 02:49:39.392
MICA: Her name is Fen.

4165
02:49:39.392 --> 02:49:41.654
SAM: Fen is a cool name.

4166
02:49:41.654 --> 02:49:42.780
TALIESIN: The Glassblade.

4167
02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:43.613
MICA: Yeah.

4168
02:49:43.613 --> 02:49:47.142
TRAVIS: How far is she from where we are?

4169
02:49:47.142 --> 02:49:50.360
MATT: She lives in the Glassblade Kaserne,

4170
02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:52.194
which is right by the entrance to the city.

4171
02:49:52.194 --> 02:49:53.788
TALIESIN: All right.

4172
02:49:53.788 --> 02:49:55.887
LAURA: Oh good, that's close to our hotel.

4173
02:49:55.887 --> 02:49:56.902
MICA: Oh, that's nice.

4174
02:49:56.902 --> 02:49:58.400
Did you guys leave anything in your hotel

4175
02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:00.352
that we may need to get?

4176
02:50:00.352 --> 02:50:02.723
SAM: No.
TRAVIS: We seem to travel very lightly.

4177
02:50:02.723 --> 02:50:04.838
LIAM: Your idea is a good one.

4178
02:50:04.838 --> 02:50:06.366
LAURA: Thank you, Caleb.

4179
02:50:06.366 --> 02:50:09.818
LIAM: We should see this Fen and then pivot to that.

4180
02:50:09.818 --> 02:50:10.651
LAURA: Okay.

4181
02:50:10.651 --> 02:50:12.184
I can send a message to Essek

4182
02:50:12.184 --> 02:50:13.493
and see if he'd be down to help us.

4183
02:50:13.493 --> 02:50:14.683
SAM: Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

4184
02:50:14.683 --> 02:50:17.997
Do you want to try that first or after Fen?

4185
02:50:17.997 --> 02:50:19.357
LAURA: We can talk to Fen.

4186
02:50:19.357 --> 02:50:21.618
SAM: Okay, let's go talk to Fen.

4187
02:50:21.618 --> 02:50:24.649
MICA: And at the very least, they have horses.

4188
02:50:24.649 --> 02:50:27.795
Or goats or things we can ride

4189
02:50:27.795 --> 02:50:32.795
and then that'll help and we don't have to walk.

4190
02:50:33.189 --> 02:50:34.522
MARISHA: Goats are cool.

4191
02:50:34.522 --> 02:50:35.936
LAURA: Also riding a goat could be really fun.

4192
02:50:35.936 --> 02:50:37.676
MARISHA: Yep, they got square eyes.

4193
02:50:37.676 --> 02:50:39.255
MICA: But they smell really bad.

4194
02:50:39.255 --> 02:50:40.256
LAURA: No.
MICA: Yeah.

4195
02:50:40.256 --> 02:50:42.331
TALIESIN: I like the way they smell.

4196
02:50:43.536 --> 02:50:47.322
MATT: Strangely, Caduceus smells not entirely dissimilar
to some of the goats.

4197
02:50:47.322 --> 02:50:48.787
TALIESIN: I have been told that.

4198
02:50:48.787 --> 02:50:50.246
(laughter)

4199
02:50:50.246 --> 02:50:52.079
TRAVIS: "I've been told that."

4200
02:50:53.237 --> 02:50:55.820
"You smell like a goat."
"Yeah, I know it."

4201
02:50:58.902 --> 02:51:01.479
MATT: All right, do you guys wish to head to the Kaserne then?

4202
02:51:01.479 --> 02:51:02.312
SAM: Sure.

4203
02:51:02.312 --> 02:51:03.145
MATT: All right.

4204
02:51:03.145 --> 02:51:05.457
You remember seeing elements of this when you first arrived.

4205
02:51:05.457 --> 02:51:08.044
You didn't take too much to stock in the barracks

4206
02:51:08.044 --> 02:51:10.437
because you were instead focused more on

4207
02:51:10.437 --> 02:51:15.437
this entire city opening before you
after you descended the large pit.

4208
02:51:15.965 --> 02:51:18.817
While returning back through the Volition Disk,

4209
02:51:18.817 --> 02:51:20.803
to the entrance of the city, you come to the base of

4210
02:51:20.803 --> 02:51:23.286
the spiral stairs that lead up and out

4211
02:51:23.286 --> 02:51:24.916
of the city of Uthodurn under the mountains.

4212
02:51:24.916 --> 02:51:27.054
And there, to the back of where this pit

4213
02:51:27.054 --> 02:51:28.620
and these descending staircases are,

4214
02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:30.468
you see the three separate chambers that lead

4215
02:51:30.468 --> 02:51:33.700
to the Glassblade Kaserne which is

4216
02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:38.691
a number of embedded housing, training,

4217
02:51:38.691 --> 02:51:42.420
and storage areas for the Glassblades
and all the various elements

4218
02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:46.274
of main military protection that the city itself provides

4219
02:51:46.274 --> 02:51:50.193
to defend itself and to house some of the rangers

4220
02:51:50.193 --> 02:51:52.699
and other ones that keep the exterior elements

4221
02:51:52.699 --> 02:51:54.116
of the city safe.

4222
02:51:55.793 --> 02:51:57.008
You already know where to go.

4223
02:51:57.008 --> 02:51:58.840
There isn't-- you do have an actual guide

4224
02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:02.878
to the city here which helps a lot more
of your wandering fuckery

4225
02:52:02.878 --> 02:52:06.091
that usually a new town entails.

4226
02:52:06.091 --> 02:52:08.601
A few questions are asked as some of the other Glassblades

4227
02:52:08.601 --> 02:52:10.631
see your unfamiliar companions and are just asking for

4228
02:52:10.631 --> 02:52:13.202
confirmation, but they trust you.

4229
02:52:13.202 --> 02:52:15.668
You're not going going to any sort of weird, secret place,

4230
02:52:15.668 --> 02:52:18.606
you're just trying to find out where Fen exists.

4231
02:52:18.606 --> 02:52:22.503
Heading over to Fen's portion of the barracks,

4232
02:52:22.503 --> 02:52:26.638
you find she's in the process of working with a small troop

4233
02:52:26.638 --> 02:52:29.313
practicing archery in this long chamber,

4234
02:52:29.313 --> 02:52:32.198
and you watch as one after one, they're taking arrows out,

4235
02:52:32.198 --> 02:52:35.900
nocking them, and firing for target practice.

4236
02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:37.763
One of the Glassblades that sees you approach goes like,

4237
02:52:37.763 --> 02:52:39.174
"(clears throat)

4238
02:52:39.174 --> 02:52:40.232
"Fen?

4239
02:52:40.232 --> 02:52:42.350
"Fen, you got company."

4240
02:52:42.350 --> 02:52:44.502
And Fen turns and looks back.

4241
02:52:44.502 --> 02:52:45.903
(Fen) "Huh."

4242
02:52:45.903 --> 02:52:48.029
Puts the bow away, throws it over the shoulder,

4243
02:52:48.029 --> 02:52:50.874
comes up and smiles and gives you a hug.

4244
02:52:50.874 --> 02:52:52.250
"Reani."

4245
02:52:52.250 --> 02:52:53.083
MICA: Hi.
SAM: Aww.

4246
02:52:55.380 --> 02:52:57.289
MICA: So, um--

4247
02:52:58.213 --> 02:53:01.096
MATT: "I know that face, you look concerned.

4248
02:53:01.096 --> 02:53:02.726
"What's on your mind, girl?"

4249
02:53:02.726 --> 02:53:03.976
MICA: Don't be mad.

4250
02:53:05.613 --> 02:53:07.696
We need to find a dragon.

4251
02:53:08.655 --> 02:53:11.240
MATT: Pulls the hood back, and you can see now

4252
02:53:11.240 --> 02:53:14.365
this young elf

4253
02:53:14.365 --> 02:53:17.069
with pale skin, almond-shaped eyes,

4254
02:53:17.069 --> 02:53:20.082
bright blue irises, dark hair hair that is

4255
02:53:20.082 --> 02:53:22.205
tucked behind the ears and just tumbles outside

4256
02:53:22.205 --> 02:53:23.966
of the hood as she pulls it back,

4257
02:53:23.966 --> 02:53:26.208
a little more flops behind.

4258
02:53:27.619 --> 02:53:30.192
MICA: We need to kill the dragon.

4259
02:53:30.192 --> 02:53:31.906
But first we need to get the dragon

4260
02:53:31.906 --> 02:53:34.323
to blow on a piece of mithral

4261
02:53:35.865 --> 02:53:39.371
and I promised them I'd take them

4262
02:53:39.371 --> 02:53:41.372
and get them back safe.

4263
02:53:41.372 --> 02:53:43.377
MATT: "You're not doing this."
MICA: I'm gonna.

4264
02:53:43.377 --> 02:53:45.490
MATT: "You're not doing this."
MICA: This isn't a question.

4265
02:53:45.490 --> 02:53:48.300
MATT: "We're not going through this again."
MICA: I'm just telling you what's happening.

4266
02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:50.691
And we need some sort of magic

4267
02:53:50.691 --> 02:53:52.054
that they said the elves know

4268
02:53:52.054 --> 02:53:54.609
and you're an elf that I know.

4269
02:53:54.609 --> 02:53:56.995
So you're going to give us the information

4270
02:53:56.995 --> 02:53:59.844
and I'm going to go free without a lecture, right?

4271
02:53:59.844 --> 02:54:01.185
MATT: "I'm not going to help you run off to your death,

4272
02:54:01.185 --> 02:54:02.193
don't be stupid."

4273
02:54:02.193 --> 02:54:03.201
MICA: I'm not going to run off to my death,

4274
02:54:03.201 --> 02:54:04.067
I'm going to be fine.

4275
02:54:04.067 --> 02:54:04.900
I have a bunch of people with me.

4276
02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:07.105
This dude's huge, and he's fine and we--

4277
02:54:07.105 --> 02:54:08.521
MATT: "How many came back with you from

4278
02:54:08.521 --> 02:54:10.348
the Savalirwood, huh?"

4279
02:54:10.348 --> 02:54:11.937
MICA: One, but that's not the point!

4280
02:54:11.937 --> 02:54:13.741
MATT: "That is the point, that's exactly the point!"

4281
02:54:13.741 --> 02:54:15.816
MICA: That's not the point, I'll be fine!

4282
02:54:17.742 --> 02:54:20.838
I came here because I knew you'd help.

4283
02:54:20.838 --> 02:54:22.622
So let's just skip over this

4284
02:54:22.622 --> 02:54:24.237
and you're going to give me the information

4285
02:54:24.237 --> 02:54:26.053
and we're going to go, okay?

4286
02:54:30.373 --> 02:54:32.434
MATT: "There's no way of stopping you?"

4287
02:54:32.434 --> 02:54:35.667
MICA: You know me well enough to know that there isn't.

4288
02:54:36.884 --> 02:54:39.534
MATT: "Why do you have to kill the dragon?"

4289
02:54:41.498 --> 02:54:42.524
MICA: I don't know if I have to kill it

4290
02:54:42.524 --> 02:54:44.270
but Samliel told me I have to see it.

4291
02:54:44.270 --> 02:54:45.778
I have to go there, I have to know what I have to do,

4292
02:54:45.778 --> 02:54:46.611
I can't--

4293
02:54:47.913 --> 02:54:52.222
I'm not-- I'm not doing this with you right now.

4294
02:54:54.234 --> 02:54:55.531
Please.

4295
02:54:55.531 --> 02:54:57.530
MATT: "(sighs)

4296
02:54:57.530 --> 02:55:00.972
She looks over at the rest of you.

4297
02:55:00.972 --> 02:55:02.862
MARISHA: I avert my gaze.

4298
02:55:02.862 --> 02:55:03.695
TALIESIN: I don't.

4299
02:55:03.695 --> 02:55:05.932
SAM: We're very dependable.

4300
02:55:05.932 --> 02:55:07.682
We won't let her die.

4301
02:55:09.051 --> 02:55:11.552
LAURA: We didn't tell her she had to find the white dragon.

4302
02:55:11.552 --> 02:55:14.567
She just really wants to find one too.

4303
02:55:14.567 --> 02:55:18.692
TRAVIS: It's for a very noble and good cause.

4304
02:55:18.692 --> 02:55:20.723
LAURA: Also, we're pretty strong,

4305
02:55:20.723 --> 02:55:23.140
and she seems pretty strong so--

4306
02:55:24.146 --> 02:55:27.229
MATT: Both of you make persuasion checks.

4307
02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:31.743
LAURA: 13.

4308
02:55:31.743 --> 02:55:32.576
TRAVIS: 17.

4309
02:55:32.576 --> 02:55:33.927
SAM: Okay.

4310
02:55:33.927 --> 02:55:35.260
LIAM: Fjord tough.

4311
02:55:39.091 --> 02:55:41.423
MATT: "And what do you want from me?

4312
02:55:41.423 --> 02:55:42.256
"Again?"

4313
02:55:44.213 --> 02:55:49.135
MICA: I-- they need to know something about a circle or--

4314
02:55:49.135 --> 02:55:50.435
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

4315
02:55:50.435 --> 02:55:54.294
MICA: I don't know, I just, they said an elf might know and--

4316
02:55:54.294 --> 02:55:57.078
LIAM: A teleportation circle. This is a large city,

4317
02:55:57.078 --> 02:56:01.420
we thought perhaps there would be
a means of transportation here.

4318
02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:02.829
MATT: "Probably."

4319
02:56:04.277 --> 02:56:05.710
LIAM: Probably but you do not know--

4320
02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:07.260
MATT: "I'm a grunt, I--

4321
02:56:09.026 --> 02:56:11.747
"I'm more comfortable up top side
than in this city half the time,

4322
02:56:11.747 --> 02:56:13.974
"I don't know much in the ways of magic.

4323
02:56:13.974 --> 02:56:15.513
"I know you assumed but--"

4324
02:56:15.513 --> 02:56:18.680
MICA: Do you know someone that would know?

4325
02:56:22.013 --> 02:56:23.054
Please?

4326
02:56:25.034 --> 02:56:26.207
MATT: "I mean, your best bet's probably with

4327
02:56:26.207 --> 02:56:28.981
where they keep most of the arcane knowledge,
which is the Steeple.

4328
02:56:28.981 --> 02:56:30.149
LAURA: Ooh.

4329
02:56:30.149 --> 02:56:31.649
MARISHA: (chuckles)

4330
02:56:33.854 --> 02:56:34.862
TRAVIS: Fuck.

4331
02:56:34.862 --> 02:56:37.112
SAM: Only <i>we</i> were banned.

4332
02:56:38.292 --> 02:56:41.141
TALIESIN: Beyond that, is there any fast travel west

4333
02:56:41.141 --> 02:56:43.141
that's safer and more--

4334
02:56:44.605 --> 02:56:46.061
contained, we can make this journey

4335
02:56:46.061 --> 02:56:50.478
that are our chances of all coming back in one piece.

4336
02:56:54.845 --> 02:56:57.345
MATT: "Where are you looking to go?"

4337
02:56:59.810 --> 02:57:01.408
TALIESIN: You've got the--
MICA: You've got the map.

4338
02:57:01.408 --> 02:57:04.609
TRAVIS: It's called Mythburrow.

4339
02:57:04.609 --> 02:57:07.950
SAM: Mythburrow, 350 miles northwest?

4340
02:57:07.950 --> 02:57:11.713
MATT: "That's ridiculous, you're traveling to Mythburrow?"

4341
02:57:11.713 --> 02:57:14.322
MICA: I know it's cursed or whatever,

4342
02:57:14.322 --> 02:57:16.107
but I'm sure that's just a rumor.

4343
02:57:16.107 --> 02:57:17.705
TALIESIN: There's a curse?

4344
02:57:17.705 --> 02:57:19.822
MARISHA: I'll tell you later.
TALIESIN: Okay.

4345
02:57:21.378 --> 02:57:22.211
MICA: Come on.

4346
02:57:23.811 --> 02:57:24.877
MATT: "Please don't do this.

4347
02:57:24.877 --> 02:57:26.052
"Not again."

4348
02:57:26.052 --> 02:57:29.014
MICA: I made it back last time, didn't I?

4349
02:57:29.014 --> 02:57:30.468
MATT: "Last time you did."

4350
02:57:30.468 --> 02:57:32.018
SAM: What was this last time?

4351
02:57:32.018 --> 02:57:33.251
Was this a--

4352
02:57:34.629 --> 02:57:36.487
Some deadly mission?

4353
02:57:38.301 --> 02:57:39.771
MATT: "You're not part of this conversation."

4354
02:57:39.771 --> 02:57:42.724
SAM: Oh, but I thought that I was because I was here.

4355
02:57:44.249 --> 02:57:46.832
MICA: Careful, she might shoot you.

4356
02:57:51.041 --> 02:57:54.149
MATT: "There's no stopping you, is there?"

4357
02:57:54.149 --> 02:57:56.399
MICA: I can't let Samliel down.

4358
02:58:01.625 --> 02:58:03.408
MATT: "I love you, but I can't

4359
02:58:03.408 --> 02:58:06.223
"be part of you running to your death."

4360
02:58:06.223 --> 02:58:08.333
MICA: You can't say you love me and then

4361
02:58:08.333 --> 02:58:10.436
turn around and betray me like this, not again.

4362
02:58:10.436 --> 02:58:11.269
SAM: Oh!

4363
02:58:13.408 --> 02:58:15.025
MATT: "Don't put the blame on me."

4364
02:58:15.025 --> 02:58:16.854
MICA: I'm always going to put the blame on you

4365
02:58:16.854 --> 02:58:18.654
if you're always going to stick your foot in the mud

4366
02:58:18.654 --> 02:58:19.881
and just not--

4367
02:58:19.881 --> 02:58:21.973
and I just walk away at that point.

4368
02:58:23.897 --> 02:58:25.610
MATT: Throws her hood up and goes back,

4369
02:58:25.610 --> 02:58:28.397
and starts firing arrows with increased anger

4370
02:58:28.397 --> 02:58:30.880
amongst the rest of the Glassblades.

4371
02:58:33.475 --> 02:58:37.168
TRAVIS: Well, we seem to have struck a sore spot.

4372
02:58:37.168 --> 02:58:38.321
Yes.

4373
02:58:38.321 --> 02:58:40.324
SAM: I feel like we've learned so much about her

4374
02:58:40.324 --> 02:58:42.526
in like two hours.

4375
02:58:42.526 --> 02:58:44.834
No, six hours.

4376
02:58:44.834 --> 02:58:48.073
Secret identities, relationships.

4377
02:58:48.073 --> 02:58:51.881
TRAVIS: We will try to keep her in good care.

4378
02:58:51.881 --> 02:58:53.564
Sorry if we've disturbed you.

4379
02:58:53.564 --> 02:58:55.656
LIAM: She stormed off, didn't she?

4380
02:58:55.656 --> 02:58:58.239
MATT: She's just ignoring you guys.

4381
02:58:59.112 --> 02:59:03.071
LIAM: Perhaps I can make a contribution

4382
02:59:03.071 --> 02:59:05.569
to the archives as an apology.

4383
02:59:07.016 --> 02:59:09.681
If we need to use the circle there.

4384
02:59:09.681 --> 02:59:11.359
SAM: We don't know if there's a circle.

4385
02:59:11.359 --> 02:59:12.692
LIAM: We don't know.

4386
02:59:14.090 --> 02:59:16.101
MARISHA: I can go in and ask them first

4387
02:59:16.101 --> 02:59:18.416
and then we could go from there.

4388
02:59:18.416 --> 02:59:19.249
LIAM: Yeah.

4389
02:59:20.578 --> 02:59:22.898
TRAVIS: Yes, let's try that.

4390
02:59:22.898 --> 02:59:25.137
LAURA: Do you want to look at that spell?

4391
02:59:25.137 --> 02:59:29.554
That page I mean, that page, I don't know what it is.

4392
02:59:31.498 --> 02:59:34.191
LIAM: Yeah, perhaps while Beauregard is speaking inside,

4393
02:59:34.191 --> 02:59:35.287
I will take a moment, yeah.

4394
02:59:35.287 --> 02:59:38.380
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4395
02:59:38.380 --> 02:59:41.906
MARISHA: I guess we should check in with Rena.

4396
02:59:41.906 --> 02:59:43.298
Reani.

4397
02:59:43.298 --> 02:59:44.320
TRAVIS: Reani.

4398
02:59:44.320 --> 02:59:47.310
SAM: Yeah, did she, where'd she huff off to?

4399
02:59:47.310 --> 02:59:48.222
MATT: She huffed off back towards

4400
02:59:48.222 --> 02:59:50.356
the entrance away from the Kaserne.

4401
02:59:50.356 --> 02:59:54.172
All right, well let's catch up with her.

4402
02:59:54.172 --> 02:59:57.058
Reani, Reani, hello?

4403
02:59:57.058 --> 02:59:57.891
Hello?

4404
02:59:57.891 --> 02:59:59.967
MICA: I'm just sitting outside on the sidewalk.

4405
02:59:59.967 --> 03:00:01.191
SAM: Oh, there you are.

4406
03:00:01.191 --> 03:00:04.050
(laughter)

4407
03:00:04.050 --> 03:00:07.163
TRAVIS: I take it that didn't go as planned?

4408
03:00:07.163 --> 03:00:09.344
MICA: No, I knew she'd say that.

4409
03:00:09.344 --> 03:00:11.345
I thought maybe she'd help.

4410
03:00:11.345 --> 03:00:14.486
TALIESIN: It can be difficult for others

4411
03:00:14.486 --> 03:00:17.567
when you answer to a higher power.

4412
03:00:17.567 --> 03:00:18.582
MICA: Yeah.

4413
03:00:18.582 --> 03:00:19.499
But like--

4414
03:00:21.071 --> 03:00:23.062
I'm not going to die!

4415
03:00:23.062 --> 03:00:24.782
I'll be fine.

4416
03:00:24.782 --> 03:00:25.944
I don't know why she won't help me.

4417
03:00:25.944 --> 03:00:27.127
LAURA: Are you immortal?

4418
03:00:27.127 --> 03:00:27.960
MICA: No.

4419
03:00:31.079 --> 03:00:33.633
LIAM: We get pretty banged up.

4420
03:00:33.633 --> 03:00:35.141
MICA: So do I.

4421
03:00:36.678 --> 03:00:40.095
TALIESIN: Eventually, everyone doesn't come back.

4422
03:00:41.292 --> 03:00:42.988
MICA: But it's not my time yet.

4423
03:00:42.988 --> 03:00:44.274
LAURA: Do you know your time?

4424
03:00:44.274 --> 03:00:46.176
MICA: No,

4425
03:00:46.176 --> 03:00:49.009
but I trust Samliel would tell me.

4426
03:00:50.140 --> 03:00:52.140
But Fen doesn't get it.

4427
03:00:54.518 --> 03:00:56.315
TALIESIN: It's important not to get angry at people

4428
03:00:56.315 --> 03:00:58.398
for what they don't know.

4429
03:00:59.236 --> 03:01:00.069
MICA: I guess.

4430
03:01:01.858 --> 03:01:05.129
SAM: This Sam Riegel or however you say it

4431
03:01:05.129 --> 03:01:08.146
is very smart and wise.

4432
03:01:09.422 --> 03:01:12.431
And I know you can trust him.

4433
03:01:14.904 --> 03:01:17.839
So put your faith in Sam Riegel, and he'll be,

4434
03:01:17.839 --> 03:01:20.157
he'll guide you, from the back.

4435
03:01:20.157 --> 03:01:22.610
LIAM: The election's over, Sam.

4436
03:01:22.610 --> 03:01:23.929
SAM: This is just for me.

4437
03:01:23.929 --> 03:01:28.629
(laughter)

4438
03:01:31.314 --> 03:01:32.231
MICA: I mean...

4439
03:01:36.130 --> 03:01:41.108
Do you ever think that maybe

4440
03:01:41.108 --> 03:01:45.275
higher powers don't have the best interest in you?

4441
03:01:47.068 --> 03:01:48.514
TRAVIS: Yes.

4442
03:01:48.514 --> 03:01:49.347
MICA: Oh.

4443
03:01:50.365 --> 03:01:51.373
So a lot of you.

4444
03:01:51.373 --> 03:01:52.513
TALIESIN: I think the higher powers have

4445
03:01:52.513 --> 03:01:54.614
the best interests of everything

4446
03:01:54.614 --> 03:01:56.638
and sometimes the best interests of everything

4447
03:01:56.638 --> 03:01:58.596
don't necessarily line up with

4448
03:01:58.596 --> 03:02:01.165
the best interests of each of us.

4449
03:02:01.165 --> 03:02:02.248
TRAVIS: Or what we want.

4450
03:02:02.248 --> 03:02:03.748
TALIESIN: Or what we want.

4451
03:02:04.636 --> 03:02:05.968
MICA: Well, that sucks.

4452
03:02:05.968 --> 03:02:07.494
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4453
03:02:07.494 --> 03:02:11.434
MICA: Well, I'm still going to help you find your dragon.

4454
03:02:11.434 --> 03:02:15.038
And I'm still going to help you kill the dragon. And--

4455
03:02:15.038 --> 03:02:16.079
LAURA: Maybe we won't have to!

4456
03:02:16.079 --> 03:02:17.360
MICA: Or maybe we won't have to.

4457
03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:21.286
And then, maybe Fen won't be mad at me any more.

4458
03:02:21.286 --> 03:02:24.275
TRAVIS: She mentioned before, who is she to you

4459
03:02:24.275 --> 03:02:26.967
and what happened before?

4460
03:02:26.967 --> 03:02:27.800
MICA: Well...

4461
03:02:31.279 --> 03:02:35.137
She saved me five years ago.

4462
03:02:36.243 --> 03:02:37.470
I was out patrolling

4463
03:02:37.470 --> 03:02:40.711
and I was trying to save

4464
03:02:40.711 --> 03:02:43.211
a trapper out in the snow

4465
03:02:43.211 --> 03:02:46.371
and I was hurt and she saved me and...

4466
03:02:47.891 --> 03:02:51.899
I thought I was going to marry her one day.

4467
03:02:51.899 --> 03:02:54.740
But I wanted to join an expedition

4468
03:02:54.740 --> 03:02:56.747
that she knew was going to get me killed,

4469
03:02:56.747 --> 03:02:58.540
but I wanted to go because I wanted to help

4470
03:02:58.540 --> 03:03:00.835
because I'm supposed to help people.

4471
03:03:00.835 --> 03:03:04.893
We argued and she told me that

4472
03:03:04.893 --> 03:03:06.376
if I'm not going to stay

4473
03:03:06.376 --> 03:03:08.923
and keep the city safe and keep myself safe,

4474
03:03:08.923 --> 03:03:12.090
then we could never be together, so.

4475
03:03:15.432 --> 03:03:17.315
TRAVIS: Right.

4476
03:03:18.968 --> 03:03:20.362
TALIESIN: That's difficult.

4477
03:03:20.362 --> 03:03:22.186
LAURA: Yeah, sometimes the people that love you

4478
03:03:22.186 --> 03:03:24.351
just want to keep you around

4479
03:03:24.351 --> 03:03:26.554
and so that they know you're safe

4480
03:03:26.554 --> 03:03:29.402
and it's only because, you know,

4481
03:03:29.402 --> 03:03:32.316
they care about you so much.

4482
03:03:32.316 --> 03:03:35.948
MICA: But I also have to care about everyone.

4483
03:03:35.948 --> 03:03:37.447
You know, it's my job.

4484
03:03:37.447 --> 03:03:38.280
LAURA: Yeah.

4485
03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:41.766
MICA: How am I supposed to put myself before everyone?

4486
03:03:41.766 --> 03:03:45.908
MARISHA: Well, I think you're included in everyone.

4487
03:03:45.908 --> 03:03:47.768
MICA: Sometimes I just don't feel like that.

4488
03:03:47.768 --> 03:03:49.101
And that's okay.

4489
03:03:51.676 --> 03:03:54.546
TRAVIS: Well, perhaps we should send Beau in

4490
03:03:54.546 --> 03:03:57.445
and acquire if there is a circle to be used in the archive.

4491
03:03:57.445 --> 03:03:59.186
LIAM: Yes. We have a definitive plan,

4492
03:03:59.186 --> 03:04:00.821
a good plan that Jester came up with.

4493
03:04:00.821 --> 03:04:02.442
MICA: Why can't we all go in?

4494
03:04:02.442 --> 03:04:04.646
SAM: Oh, well, um...

4495
03:04:04.646 --> 03:04:08.100
Some of us are banned from ever going back into the--

4496
03:04:08.100 --> 03:04:09.133
TRAVIS: Did you say banned?

4497
03:04:09.133 --> 03:04:12.582
LAURA: Just until further notice is all.
MICA: What happened?!

4498
03:04:12.582 --> 03:04:14.214
TALIESIN: Oh...
TRAVIS: I think we were gone for 30 minutes!

4499
03:04:14.214 --> 03:04:16.225
TALIESIN: I just realized who we left alone.

4500
03:04:16.225 --> 03:04:17.574
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh.

4501
03:04:17.574 --> 03:04:18.407
MICA: Should we not've?

4502
03:04:18.407 --> 03:04:20.248
TALIESIN: No.
MICA: Oh.

4503
03:04:20.248 --> 03:04:24.569
TALIESIN: Wow, ha ha, that's a-- wow.

4504
03:04:24.569 --> 03:04:27.090
LAURA: Chaos crew in the house!

4505
03:04:27.090 --> 03:04:29.614
LIAM: Would you take this, perhaps it will be a help,

4506
03:04:29.614 --> 03:04:34.094
and I give 300 gold to Beauregard.

4507
03:04:34.094 --> 03:04:37.663
If that will help grease the wheels or make amends.

4508
03:04:37.663 --> 03:04:38.703
MARISHA: All right.

4509
03:04:38.703 --> 03:04:41.243
SAM: Why is Beauregard going in? She was part of the chaos.

4510
03:04:41.243 --> 03:04:42.711
LAURA: She's from the Cobalt...

4511
03:04:42.711 --> 03:04:45.294
LIAM: She smoothed things a little.

4512
03:04:46.376 --> 03:04:48.463
SAM: Maybe Reani could go, Reani knows people there.

4513
03:04:48.463 --> 03:04:51.188
MICA: I can go with you!
LIAM: Why don't you both go ahead?

4514
03:04:51.188 --> 03:04:52.597
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do this.

4515
03:04:52.597 --> 03:04:53.430
MICA: Yeah!

4516
03:04:53.430 --> 03:04:55.359
SAM: We'll stay out here and analyze your page.

4517
03:04:55.359 --> 03:04:57.776
LIAM: You know, good cap, asshole cop.

4518
03:04:59.773 --> 03:05:01.133
MARISHA: Yeah, you know that, right?

4519
03:05:01.133 --> 03:05:03.694
Yeah, also something we omitted.

4520
03:05:03.694 --> 03:05:04.527
All right.

4521
03:05:04.527 --> 03:05:06.777
(laughter)

4522
03:05:10.155 --> 03:05:12.029
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

4523
03:05:12.029 --> 03:05:15.837
MATT: You trek your way back to the Volition Disk,

4524
03:05:15.837 --> 03:05:18.064
to the Liber Disk, eventually coming to

4525
03:05:18.064 --> 03:05:22.944
the familiar sight of the exterior of the Vellum Steeple,

4526
03:05:22.944 --> 03:05:27.515
and you both approach and enter the familiar site

4527
03:05:27.515 --> 03:05:29.498
of the two

4528
03:05:29.498 --> 03:05:34.498
front-facing clerks of the Steeple.

4529
03:05:34.919 --> 03:05:36.531
The same older woman still going through the same,

4530
03:05:36.531 --> 03:05:38.290
looks like a few more pages later into

4531
03:05:38.290 --> 03:05:40.074
whatever the next puzzles have her entranced

4532
03:05:40.074 --> 03:05:43.094
and the younger male elf if half asleep, going

4533
03:05:43.094 --> 03:05:45.261
(snoring)

4534
03:05:47.581 --> 03:05:50.124
MARISHA: Is there like a desk, those chimes from earlier

4535
03:05:50.124 --> 03:05:52.291
(ringing)

4536
03:05:53.130 --> 03:05:53.963
MATT: "Hello?"

4537
03:05:53.963 --> 03:05:56.963
MARISHA: Need to speak to the Scribewarden.

4538
03:05:59.133 --> 03:06:00.942
MATT: "It's your funeral."

4539
03:06:00.942 --> 03:06:01.775
Gets up and--

4540
03:06:01.775 --> 03:06:04.867
MARISHA: Wait what, what, why?

4541
03:06:04.867 --> 03:06:06.998
MATT: "Because she's busy!"

4542
03:06:06.998 --> 03:06:09.156
MARISHA: Oh. I don't care about that.

4543
03:06:09.156 --> 03:06:10.991
(laughter)

4544
03:06:14.349 --> 03:06:15.432
MATT: Comes back.

4545
03:06:16.776 --> 03:06:17.856
"Right, hello.

4546
03:06:17.856 --> 03:06:19.839
"Uh, uh.

4547
03:06:20.856 --> 03:06:23.795
"Your friends have caused a ruckus

4548
03:06:23.795 --> 03:06:28.403
"and as such, for the time being,

4549
03:06:28.403 --> 03:06:31.901
"it would be appreciated as to

4550
03:06:31.901 --> 03:06:35.054
"the day's interest in the Steeple come to a close."

4551
03:06:35.054 --> 03:06:37.676
MARISHA: I wanted to extend a deepest apology

4552
03:06:37.676 --> 03:06:39.713
on behalf of my coworkers

4553
03:06:39.713 --> 03:06:43.235
and of course, myself, on what happened.

4554
03:06:43.235 --> 03:06:47.841
It was totally uncalled for, things got out of hand.

4555
03:06:47.841 --> 03:06:50.581
As leader of this ground, I promise

4556
03:06:50.581 --> 03:06:54.121
I will never let that happen again.

4557
03:06:54.121 --> 03:06:58.103
MICA: Also, I vouch for them.

4558
03:06:58.103 --> 03:06:59.823
MARISHA: She likes us.

4559
03:06:59.823 --> 03:07:04.782
Here, this is from the wizard himself.

4560
03:07:05.998 --> 03:07:07.930
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

4561
03:07:07.930 --> 03:07:09.558
LIAM: ♪ (beginning of "Immigrant Song") ♪

4562
03:07:09.558 --> 03:07:10.840

LIAM: Both good, both good.

4566
03:07:16.440 --> 03:07:17.984

4570
03:07:27.625 --> 03:07:29.975
MATT: The Scribewarden reaches out, takes the sack of coins,

4571
03:07:29.975 --> 03:07:32.907
and shakes it a bit.

4572
03:07:32.907 --> 03:07:34.808
"Your apology's accepted."

4573
03:07:34.808 --> 03:07:35.641
MARISHA: Thank you.

4574
03:07:35.641 --> 03:07:38.206
MATT: "Those at the Steeple

4575
03:07:38.206 --> 03:07:41.800

"What do you require of the Steeple?"

MICA: What do we require of the Steeple?

4579
03:07:49.868 --> 03:07:52.359
MARISHA: We're looking for potential arcane

4580
03:07:52.359 --> 03:07:54.592
means of transportation

4581
03:07:54.592 --> 03:07:58.136
and if the Steeple has access to a teleportation circle,

4582
03:07:58.136 --> 03:07:59.997
to be more specific.

4583
03:07:59.997 --> 03:08:02.095
If you don't have access,

4584
03:08:02.095 --> 03:08:04.377
if you could point us in the direction,

4585
03:08:04.377 --> 03:08:08.143
I would be obliged.

4586
03:08:09.349 --> 03:08:13.025
MATT: "If I might ask, what is
your interest with this circle?"

4587
03:08:13.025 --> 03:08:16.810
MARISHA: We have matters to attend to at great haste.

4588
03:08:16.810 --> 03:08:19.317
So it would be good to have that,

4589
03:08:19.317 --> 03:08:24.050
than to travel by goat for two weeks.

4590
03:08:28.373 --> 03:08:30.790
MATT: "We do have one such circle,

4591
03:08:31.702 --> 03:08:35.493
"but it is for the Steeple

4592
03:08:35.493 --> 03:08:39.834
and Diarchy use only."

4593
03:08:40.886 --> 03:08:44.732
MARISHA: These matters that we are attempting to solve

4594
03:08:44.732 --> 03:08:47.315
pose a great threat to not only

4595
03:08:48.965 --> 03:08:50.696
the surrounding communities,

4596
03:08:50.696 --> 03:08:55.696
but the continent and potentially the world at large.

4597
03:08:55.761 --> 03:08:57.236
MATT: "That's very large.

4598
03:08:57.236 --> 03:08:58.673
"Wow."

4599
03:08:58.673 --> 03:09:00.390
MARISHA: So large.

4600
03:09:01.282 --> 03:09:03.040
MATT: "Curious.

4601
03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:04.744
"What are these issues, if you would be specific please,

4602
03:09:04.744 --> 03:09:09.594
"I'm definitely entranced by the possibilities."

4603
03:09:11.832 --> 03:09:13.881
MARISHA: Well, it has to deal a little bit with

4604
03:09:13.881 --> 03:09:17.091
the ongoing conflict between the Dynasty and the Empire

4605
03:09:17.091 --> 03:09:21.091
and the fact that a demon incursion might be

4606
03:09:21.091 --> 03:09:24.018
overwriting those entire events and

4607
03:09:24.018 --> 03:09:28.851
utilizing that to invade us in a very

4608
03:09:28.851 --> 03:09:32.417
insidious way.

4609
03:09:32.417 --> 03:09:33.409
LIAM: That's a good book report.

4610
03:09:33.409 --> 03:09:34.875
LAURA: Yeah, it was.

4611
03:09:34.875 --> 03:09:35.731
TRAVIS: It's amazing teamwork.

4612
03:09:35.731 --> 03:09:37.208
MATT: Make another persuasion check.

4613
03:09:37.208 --> 03:09:39.144
LAURA: And we are very very very very

4614
03:09:39.144 --> 03:09:42.923
very very very very scared.

4615
03:09:42.923 --> 03:09:44.660
MICA: Nice Charlie Brown reference.

4616
03:09:44.660 --> 03:09:46.376
MARISHA: 10?

4617
03:09:48.255 --> 03:09:49.088
MATT: "Well...

4618
03:09:50.406 --> 03:09:51.815
"Such foreign political matters are

4619
03:09:51.815 --> 03:09:53.815
"of little interest in the Diarchy.

03:09:53.815 --> 03:09:57.815
"We'll wish to remain absolved of such scenarios.

4621

"I'm sorry I can be of no help to you."

4622
03:10:04.014 --> 03:10:06.793
MICA: At this point, I shuffle over and am like:

4623
03:10:06.793 --> 03:10:09.567
The faster the Lightbringer can go help them,

4624
03:10:09.567 --> 03:10:10.730
and come back,

4625
03:10:10.730 --> 03:10:14.364
the faster everyone will be safe here.

4626
03:10:18.774 --> 03:10:20.691
MATT: Are you doing this--

4627
03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:23.493
Are you doing this with the subtlety of

4628
03:10:23.493 --> 03:10:25.388
trying to be very convincing

4629
03:10:25.388 --> 03:10:27.184
or doing this as a veiled threat?

4630
03:10:27.184 --> 03:10:28.339
MICA: As a veiled threat.

4631
03:10:28.339 --> 03:10:29.999
MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

4632
03:10:29.999 --> 03:10:33.082
MARISHA: Come on, come on, come on, make it.

4633
03:10:34.232 --> 03:10:36.399
MICA: Oh!

4634
03:10:36.399 --> 03:10:37.614
That's a solid five.

4635
03:10:37.614 --> 03:10:38.993
LIAM: (old timey mobster) Nice outpost you've got here,

4636
03:10:38.993 --> 03:10:41.077
it'd be a shame if something happened to it.

4637
03:10:41.077 --> 03:10:42.819
(laughter)

4638
03:10:45.483 --> 03:10:48.445

"will have to do their best

03:10:50.900 --> 03:10:54.420

4641
03:10:54.420 --> 03:10:55.380
(sighs)

4642
03:10:55.380 --> 03:10:59.230
MARISHA: Well, luckily, the resources at our disposal

4643
03:10:59.230 --> 03:11:02.909
happen to involve a decent amount of cash.

4644
03:11:02.909 --> 03:11:04.417
Gold.

4645
03:11:05.906 --> 03:11:07.522
Platinum?

4646
03:11:11.682 --> 03:11:12.860
MATT: "100 platinum."

4647
03:11:12.860 --> 03:11:15.042
(gasps)

4648
03:11:15.042 --> 03:11:17.896
"And you gain access to the circle."

4649
03:11:17.896 --> 03:11:19.729
MARISHA: In perpetuity.

4650
03:11:22.352 --> 03:11:26.189
MATT: "500 platinum for perpetuity.

4651
03:11:26.189 --> 03:11:28.094
"100 for the month."

4652
03:11:28.094 --> 03:11:28.927
LIAM: Shit.

4653
03:11:28.927 --> 03:11:29.760
SAM: The month?
TRAVIS: The month.

4654
03:11:29.760 --> 03:11:30.593
SAM: Okay.

4655
03:11:30.593 --> 03:11:32.543
MARISHA: No, fuck that. That's not good enough.

4656
03:11:32.543 --> 03:11:34.154
SAM: 100 platinum is 1000 gold?

4657
03:11:34.154 --> 03:11:35.169
Is that right?

4658
03:11:35.169 --> 03:11:36.002
MARISHA: Yeah.

4659
03:11:36.002 --> 03:11:36.967
SAM: Okay.

4660
03:11:36.967 --> 03:11:37.800
Right?

4661
03:11:37.800 --> 03:11:39.029
TRAVIS: We can't afford that.

4662
03:11:39.029 --> 03:11:41.696
MARISHA: Just, hang on, hang on, hang on.

4663
03:11:42.638 --> 03:11:45.454
I need a hair tie. What is my hair--

4664
03:11:45.454 --> 03:11:46.637
LIAM: Summoning Traci!

LAURA: Traci!

TALIESIN: I haven't seen it in game very often.

4667

03:11:54.793 --> 03:11:57.107
teleportation circle on the other side (pigeon coo).

4669
03:11:57.107 --> 03:11:58.415
LAURA: We don't need another one, we've got Essek.

4670
03:11:58.415 --> 03:11:59.923
LIAM: It's 500--

4671
03:11:59.923 --> 03:12:01.833
SAM: You don't need a circle--

4672
03:12:01.833 --> 03:12:02.666
MATT: "If that's too rich for your blood,

4673
03:12:02.666 --> 03:12:04.091
"I entirely understand,

4674
03:12:04.091 --> 03:12:05.889
"but it was your offer."

4675
03:12:07.270 --> 03:12:10.291
MARISHA: What did you say, 500 permanent?

4676
03:12:10.291 --> 03:12:11.541
LAURA: Yes.

4677
03:12:14.422 --> 03:12:17.714
MARISHA: 200 platinum in perpetuity.

4678
03:12:19.542 --> 03:12:22.095
And you have full access to any of our findings

4679
03:12:22.095 --> 03:12:23.678
along our journeys.

4680
03:12:28.474 --> 03:12:29.628
(laughter)

4681
03:12:29.628 --> 03:12:31.094
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

4682
03:12:31.094 --> 03:12:32.734
MARISHA: No, what, come on!

4683
03:12:32.734 --> 03:12:33.646
LIAM: Just roll really high!

4684
03:12:33.646 --> 03:12:36.922
LAURA: Two natural 20s! It's not unheard of.

4685
03:12:36.922 --> 03:12:38.962
LIAM: Will it into existence!

4686
03:12:38.962 --> 03:12:39.940
Not bad.

4687
03:12:39.940 --> 03:12:40.773
Not bad.

4688
03:12:41.820 --> 03:12:43.299
MARISHA: 11.

4689
03:12:43.299 --> 03:12:44.182
SAM: Bad, pretty bad.

4690
03:12:44.182 --> 03:12:46.432
(laughter)

4691
03:12:47.432 --> 03:12:52.362
MATT: "I'm sorry, but your interesting, I'm sure, excursions

4692
03:12:52.362 --> 03:12:54.008
"hold very little interest for us

03:12:54.008 --> 03:12:57.312
"up here in the Greying Wildlands.

"Your political matters are your own.

"The deal sits where it is."

4696
03:13:04.566 --> 03:13:05.399
MARISHA: Fuck.

4697
03:13:05.399 --> 03:13:06.746
LAURA: Well--

4698
03:13:06.746 --> 03:13:08.163
I'm not in there.

4699
03:13:10.437 --> 03:13:11.270
TALIESIN: Hmm.

4700
03:13:13.078 --> 03:13:15.296
MARISHA: Hang on, I'm...

4701
03:13:15.296 --> 03:13:17.126
Looking at Reani.

4702
03:13:17.126 --> 03:13:18.632
LIAM: Come back for a fourth try.

4703
03:13:18.632 --> 03:13:20.394
(laughter)

4704
03:13:20.394 --> 03:13:22.194
MICA: I lost a piece of information.

4705
03:13:22.194 --> 03:13:24.458
TRAVIS: I turn into a bear and I rip him into pieces.

4706
03:13:24.458 --> 03:13:27.196
(laughter)

4707
03:13:27.196 --> 03:13:29.275
MICA: I turn into a giant scorpion

4708
03:13:29.275 --> 03:13:32.906
and I start murdering everyone I see.

4709
03:13:32.906 --> 03:13:34.128
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

4710
03:13:34.128 --> 03:13:36.827
MICA: What could possibly go wrong in that moment?

4711
03:13:36.827 --> 03:13:38.627
SAM: Sam Riegel knows all.

4712
03:13:39.714 --> 03:13:40.547
MICA: Ah--

4713
03:13:40.547 --> 03:13:41.380
TALIESIN: Sam Rieg<i>el.</i>

4714
03:13:41.380 --> 03:13:42.555
MICA: Aha!

4715
03:13:45.036 --> 03:13:46.031
MARISHA: Unless you got something.

4716
03:13:46.031 --> 03:13:47.864
MICA: I do have something.

4717
03:13:52.144 --> 03:13:53.227
200 platinum.

4718
03:13:54.769 --> 03:13:56.140
And the Lightbringer accompanies

4719
03:13:56.140 --> 03:13:59.223
another excursion to the Savalirwood.

4720
03:14:08.782 --> 03:14:10.199
MATT: "Let me go speak

4721
03:14:12.428 --> 03:14:14.625
"with my compatriots,"

4722
03:14:14.625 --> 03:14:18.146
and she leaves the complex for a second.

4723
03:14:18.146 --> 03:14:19.750
She's gone for--

4724
03:14:19.750 --> 03:14:21.813
LIAM: I can draw it.

4725
03:14:21.813 --> 03:14:23.228
LAURA: Once you see it you can draw it?

4726
03:14:23.228 --> 03:14:26.222
LIAM: No, no, I can draw my own on the floor.

4727
03:14:26.222 --> 03:14:27.929
MARISHA: You have to see the circle though, right?

4728
03:14:27.929 --> 03:14:31.537
LAURA: You can draw our own in her house!

4729
03:14:31.537 --> 03:14:33.869
MATT: Yeah, to go to the Dynasty.

4730
03:14:33.869 --> 03:14:35.591
Which still gets us to Essek.

4731
03:14:35.591 --> 03:14:37.345
Who can still take us to wherever.

4732
03:14:37.345 --> 03:14:41.032
So I can keep bring us back to the Dynasty, right?

4733
03:14:41.032 --> 03:14:42.553
MATT: Yeah, you can keep bringing them back to the Dynasty,

4734
03:14:42.553 --> 03:14:45.405
you just can't scribe a new circle.

4735
03:14:45.405 --> 03:14:48.564
LAURA: No, no, no, yeah, you can't bring us back here.

4736
03:14:48.564 --> 03:14:49.916
LIAM: I thought the plan was to go to Essek, though.

4737
03:14:49.916 --> 03:14:50.749
LAURA: Yeah!

4738
03:14:50.749 --> 03:14:54.789
MARISHA: Once we kill the dragon, we have to come back here.

4739
03:14:54.789 --> 03:14:56.497
LIAM: So we'd then go to Essek again.

4740
03:14:56.497 --> 03:14:58.739
LAURA: Yeah, that ultimately would be great.

4741
03:14:58.739 --> 03:15:03.406
MARISHA: Then we also said that that's tapping Essek a lot.

4742
03:15:04.265 --> 03:15:07.375
If I can get you this arcane circle for 200 platinum,

4743
03:15:07.375 --> 03:15:09.167
I'm going to do it for you!

4744
03:15:09.167 --> 03:15:10.369
LIAM: It's all good, it's great, it's great.

4745
03:15:10.369 --> 03:15:11.621
LAURA: And then you'll have it forever!

4746
03:15:11.621 --> 03:15:12.877
LIAM: True.
MARISHA: Yeah!

4747
03:15:12.877 --> 03:15:15.015
LAURA: And then we can come to Umi, no.

4748
03:15:15.015 --> 03:15:16.466
MARISHA: Umadurn? Umagorn!

4749
03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:20.537
MATT: Ten minutes of awkward silence pass

4750
03:15:20.537 --> 03:15:22.981
in the main entry chamber of the Steeple.

4751
03:15:22.981 --> 03:15:24.679
MARISHA: Is it just me and Reani?

4752
03:15:24.679 --> 03:15:26.345
MATT: Just you and Reani.
MICA: In that 10 minutes.

4753
03:15:26.345 --> 03:15:27.578
MATT: Then the two clerks there at the front.

4754
03:15:27.578 --> 03:15:30.700
MICA: Okay, in that 10 minutes, I made another flower crown,

4755
03:15:30.700 --> 03:15:32.975
and just placed it on Beau's head.

4756
03:15:32.975 --> 03:15:35.734
LIAM: I've also checked out that ripped-out page.

4757
03:15:35.734 --> 03:15:37.717
MATT: Right, we'll get to that in just a moment.

4758
03:15:37.717 --> 03:15:38.951
MICA: Just to kill the time.

4759
03:15:38.951 --> 03:15:39.953
MARISHA: I like it.

4760
03:15:39.953 --> 03:15:41.874
MATT: Eventually, the Scribewarden returns

4761
03:15:41.874 --> 03:15:44.374
with two other figures behind.

4762
03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:47.365
Not dressed in similar robes to the Steeple,

4763
03:15:47.365 --> 03:15:49.434
instead they are dressed in

4764
03:15:49.434 --> 03:15:54.364
a little more green and blue-themed noble attire

4765
03:15:54.364 --> 03:15:56.770
but also appear to be scholars of some kind.

4766
03:15:56.770 --> 03:15:59.929
You recognize them as being, at least their attire,

4767
03:15:59.929 --> 03:16:02.116
as members of the Woodset Auditors.

4768
03:16:02.116 --> 03:16:05.389
LIAM: Otters.
MARISHA: What are these these Woodset otters.

4769
03:16:05.389 --> 03:16:07.128
TALIESIN: Otters?

4770
03:16:07.128 --> 03:16:09.355
TRAVIS: O-T-T-E-R-S or no?

4771
03:16:09.355 --> 03:16:10.188
MATT: Auditors.

4772
03:16:10.188 --> 03:16:11.021
TALIESIN: Oh.

4773
03:16:12.298 --> 03:16:14.451
LIAM: I love it when the auditors put a rock on their chest

4774
03:16:14.451 --> 03:16:16.267
and they bang--

4775
03:16:16.267 --> 03:16:19.080
TALIESIN: And they hold hands when they're--!
MARISHA: They hold hands when they're sleeping!

4776
03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:20.101
LIAM: Just floating in the water.

4777
03:16:20.101 --> 03:16:21.433
MATT: The third part of the society here

4778
03:16:21.433 --> 03:16:24.117
is just adorable fucking otters, guys.

4779
03:16:24.117 --> 03:16:25.388
Just thousands of them.

4780
03:16:25.388 --> 03:16:26.796
TRAVIS: Otters can take down alligators.

4781
03:16:26.796 --> 03:16:30.485
LIAM: Oh, you thought the word auditor was safe, didn't ya?

4782
03:16:30.485 --> 03:16:32.511
MATT: Keep pushing me, book boy.

4783
03:16:32.511 --> 03:16:33.808
TRAVIS: "Book boy?"

4784
03:16:33.808 --> 03:16:36.058
(laughter)

4785
03:16:37.841 --> 03:16:39.236
Keep pushing me, Barnes &amp; Noble.

4786
03:16:39.236 --> 03:16:41.486
(laughter)

4787
03:16:43.463 --> 03:16:46.754
MATT: Say, Borders would be the tougher one to say.

4788
03:16:46.754 --> 03:16:47.837
All righty, so.

4789
03:16:49.633 --> 03:16:53.701
The Scribewarden "(clears throat)

4790
03:16:53.701 --> 03:16:56.868
"Should you pass on to the Lightbringer

4791

MICA: Six months, 150.

MATT: Make a persuasion check.

4799
03:17:24.167 --> 03:17:25.750
MARISHA: Ooh.
TRAVIS: Go get them!

4800
03:17:27.151 --> 03:17:28.234
Go get them!

MICA: (squeals)

03:17:32.385 --> 03:17:33.529
MATT: 12.

"(laughs)

MARISHA: Hey, don't--
MICA: Fine.

MARISHA: Don't do this if you're--
MICA: Fine.

4810

MARISHA: We can just--
MICA: Fine.

MARISHA: Don't, okay, just saying.

4812
03:17:49.303 --> 03:17:51.053
I'm letting you know.

4813
03:17:52.065 --> 03:17:53.704
MATT: The Scribewarden raises a hand and you see

4814
03:17:53.704 --> 03:17:57.125
one of the auditors approaches, paperwork already drawn up.

4815
03:17:57.125 --> 03:17:58.791
Places it on the table.
MARISHA: But he's adorable.

4816
03:17:58.791 --> 03:18:01.041
(laughter)

4817
03:18:02.260 --> 03:18:03.197
MICA: He swims up!

4818
03:18:03.197 --> 03:18:06.935
MATT: The process of handing you the quill
is extremely cute.

4819
03:18:06.935 --> 03:18:09.037
(laughter)
Goddamn it, guys.

4820
03:18:09.037 --> 03:18:10.827
MICA: Bangs it on a rock on his chest.

4821
03:18:10.827 --> 03:18:12.351
MATT: Oh, I'm going to kill you all.

4822
03:18:12.351 --> 03:18:14.256
(laughter)

4823
03:18:14.256 --> 03:18:17.197
LIAM: (As David Attenborough)
Here we see the Vellum Archive auditors

4824
03:18:17.197 --> 03:18:18.739
in their natural habitat.

4825
03:18:18.739 --> 03:18:20.989

4826

(laughter)

4828

MATT: Every DM out there,

4829
03:18:30.822 --> 03:18:32.807
you understand me.

4830
03:18:32.807 --> 03:18:34.165
You know this pain.

4831
03:18:34.165 --> 03:18:36.118
SAM: Then suddenly, a predator.

4832
03:18:36.118 --> 03:18:38.603
(laughter)

4833
03:18:38.603 --> 03:18:41.380
MARISHA: It's got a little wand.

4834
03:18:41.380 --> 03:18:42.743
Sorry, keep going.

4835
03:18:42.743 --> 03:18:46.245
LIAM: Druid swoops in for the attack!

4836
03:18:46.245 --> 03:18:47.149
MATT: Do you sign the paperwork?

4837
03:18:47.149 --> 03:18:48.208
MICA: I sign the paperwork.

4838
03:18:48.208 --> 03:18:50.237
Reluctantly, I sign the paperwork.

4839
03:18:50.237 --> 03:18:53.679
MARISHA: I hand over the 2000 gold

4840
03:18:54.756 --> 03:18:56.126
worth of cash.

4841
03:18:56.126 --> 03:18:57.352
MATT: All right.

4842
03:18:57.352 --> 03:19:01.486
MARISHA: Which is everything I have.

4843
03:19:04.417 --> 03:19:05.250
MATT: "Well.

4844
03:19:06.113 --> 03:19:08.780
"I look forward to doing business

4845
03:19:10.595 --> 03:19:11.890
"with each of you."

4846
03:19:11.890 --> 03:19:13.850
Accepts the money.

4847
03:19:13.850 --> 03:19:17.011
MARISHA: How do we, ooh, wait, wait.

4848
03:19:17.011 --> 03:19:18.448
I meant to remove.

4849
03:19:18.448 --> 03:19:20.865
I wish I could've added that.

4850
03:19:21.732 --> 03:19:24.503
Who do we contact when we want to come in?

4851
03:19:24.503 --> 03:19:26.109
MATT: "Me."

4852
03:19:26.109 --> 03:19:28.046
MARISHA: Awesome.

4853
03:19:28.046 --> 03:19:29.476
Thank you.
(laughter)

4854
03:19:29.476 --> 03:19:34.393
MARISHA: I'm distracted with the
amount of money I lost right now.

4855
03:19:35.492 --> 03:19:36.325
TRAVIS: Dope.

4856
03:19:37.588 --> 03:19:39.838
(laughter)

4857
03:19:41.327 --> 03:19:42.610
MATT: All right, so...

4858
03:19:42.610 --> 03:19:43.443
TRAVIS: Word.

4859
03:19:44.348 --> 03:19:45.181
MICA: Dope.

4860
03:19:45.181 --> 03:19:46.058
MARISHA: All right!

4861
03:19:46.058 --> 03:19:47.835
MATT: That's very Beau, though.

4862
03:19:47.835 --> 03:19:49.551
MICA: Swag.

4863
03:19:49.551 --> 03:19:51.051
MATT: All right.

4864
03:19:51.893 --> 03:19:53.118
You've made the deal.

4865
03:19:53.118 --> 03:19:55.223
You guys get the fuck out of the steeple.

4866
03:19:55.223 --> 03:19:56.463
LIAM: I hear you have a yeet circle.

4867
03:19:56.463 --> 03:19:57.598
(laughter)

4868
03:19:57.598 --> 03:19:59.294
MICA: Fucking yeet ourselves.

4869
03:19:59.294 --> 03:20:00.685
(laughter)

4870
03:20:00.685 --> 03:20:02.775
Excuse me, we'd like to yeet ourselves into the mountains.

4871
03:20:02.775 --> 03:20:04.386
MARISHA: Yeet back to Rosohna.

4872
03:20:04.386 --> 03:20:07.010
MATT: All right, so in the meantime, you are doing that.

4873
03:20:07.010 --> 03:20:10.449
LIAM: High fantasy, yes, checking out that page.

4874
03:20:10.449 --> 03:20:11.326
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

4875
03:20:11.326 --> 03:20:12.159
The page.

4876
03:20:12.159 --> 03:20:13.489
LAURA and LIAM: The page.

4877
03:20:13.489 --> 03:20:15.537
LIAM: I mean, that was like two hours at least so--

4878
03:20:15.537 --> 03:20:17.810
MATT: Yeah, so what do you wish to do?

4879
03:20:17.810 --> 03:20:21.550
LIAM: it's been a long time since I've had a page.

4880
03:20:21.550 --> 03:20:23.883
I will take the time to cast

4881
03:20:26.156 --> 03:20:28.612
Comprehend Languages to read it.

4882
03:20:28.612 --> 03:20:30.256
MATT: All right.

4883
03:20:30.256 --> 03:20:35.256
The page itself has nothing to do with the enchantment

4884
03:20:35.503 --> 03:20:37.306
you seem to sense on it.

4885
03:20:37.306 --> 03:20:41.701
The ink is different and there is definitely something

4886
03:20:41.701 --> 03:20:44.458
subtly hidden amongst the script

4887
03:20:44.458 --> 03:20:47.338
to bind some sort of magic to this page.

4888
03:20:47.338 --> 03:20:49.292
The text itself appears to be picking up

4889
03:20:49.292 --> 03:20:54.099
in the middle of an expository write-down on

4890
03:20:56.699 --> 03:21:01.477
the ability to take various forms of earth

4891
03:21:01.477 --> 03:21:06.086
and raw materials and craft them

4892
03:21:06.086 --> 03:21:09.599
through magical means into structures,

4893
03:21:09.599 --> 03:21:12.783
and essentially discussing about how in the Age of Arcanum,

4894
03:21:12.783 --> 03:21:14.651
there was very little need for masonry

4895
03:21:14.651 --> 03:21:16.249
as most all major construction

4896
03:21:16.249 --> 03:21:18.590
eventually was transitioned into

4897
03:21:18.590 --> 03:21:22.173
purely arcane-based summoning and creation.

4898
03:21:27.028 --> 03:21:30.796
LIAM: The spell is contained within the page

4899
03:21:30.796 --> 03:21:32.436
or that is hard to assess?

4900
03:21:32.436 --> 03:21:33.269
MATT: It's hard to assess.

4901
03:21:33.269 --> 03:21:35.717
There's something enchanted in this page

4902
03:21:35.717 --> 03:21:40.286
and the page-- there's something about this that--

4903
03:21:40.286 --> 03:21:43.757
LIAM: I'm going to spend another 10 minutes and identify.

4904
03:21:43.757 --> 03:21:45.295
I cast Identify on it.

4905
03:21:45.295 --> 03:21:46.128
MATT: Okay.

4906
03:21:46.974 --> 03:21:51.974
There is a strong conjuration

4907
03:21:52.157 --> 03:21:55.187
essence to this page.

4908
03:21:55.187 --> 03:21:58.800
You get the feeling that there is something

4909
03:21:58.800 --> 03:22:01.245
essentially zipped or hidden within this,

4910
03:22:01.245 --> 03:22:04.430
like there is a thin veil,

4911
03:22:04.430 --> 03:22:07.480
like a pocket,

4912
03:22:07.480 --> 03:22:08.945
that doesn't exist on this plane

4913
03:22:08.945 --> 03:22:11.884
that is woven into this page.

4914
03:22:11.884 --> 03:22:13.025
LIAM: This is some sort of portal,

4915
03:22:13.025 --> 03:22:14.385
the page itself is portal.

4916
03:22:14.385 --> 03:22:17.647
SAM: Could you dispel, dispel something?

4917
03:22:17.647 --> 03:22:18.480
LIAM: Perhaps.

4918
03:22:18.480 --> 03:22:23.480
If I study the words, could I see if there is any sort of

4919
03:22:23.876 --> 03:22:27.043
code or pattern hidden in the writing?

4920
03:22:28.036 --> 03:22:29.953
MATT: Make an arcana check.

4921
03:22:34.319 --> 03:22:35.785
LIAM: (snorts)

4922
03:22:35.785 --> 03:22:36.618
14.

4923
03:22:36.618 --> 03:22:37.579
MATT: 14?

4924
03:22:37.579 --> 03:22:40.307
SAM: Mote of possibility?
LIAM: You have to do it in advance.

4925
03:22:40.307 --> 03:22:43.315
MATT: Unfortunately, it escapes you.

4926
03:22:43.315 --> 03:22:44.614
Whoever put this--
LAURA: I look over his shoulder,

4927
03:22:44.614 --> 03:22:47.061
can I see any symbols?

4928
03:22:47.061 --> 03:22:51.153
Like drawing things that would catch my eye?

4929
03:22:51.153 --> 03:22:53.131
MATT: Make an arcana check.

4930
03:22:53.131 --> 03:22:54.173
With disadvantage.

4931
03:22:54.173 --> 03:22:55.006
LAURA: Okay.

4932
03:22:55.006 --> 03:22:56.543
MATT: This is certainly not your specialty.

4933
03:22:56.543 --> 03:22:59.317
LAURA: Well, now I'm just looking for stuff.

4934
03:22:59.317 --> 03:23:00.317
Oof.

4935
03:23:02.824 --> 03:23:03.657
16.

4936
03:23:03.657 --> 03:23:04.490
MATT: 16.

4937
03:23:05.696 --> 03:23:08.363
Not really, but it's pretty ink.

4938
03:23:10.444 --> 03:23:11.395
LAURA: It's shimmery.

4939
03:23:11.395 --> 03:23:12.434
LIAM: Yeah.

4940
03:23:12.434 --> 03:23:13.767
Something to it.

4941
03:23:17.015 --> 03:23:20.116
I will save it for a rainy day.

4942
03:23:20.116 --> 03:23:21.068
TALIESIN: We'll have time.

4943
03:23:21.068 --> 03:23:21.936
LIAM: Yeah.

4944
03:23:21.936 --> 03:23:24.236
MATT: Okay. So you pocket the page.

4945
03:23:24.236 --> 03:23:25.069
LIAM: Yeah.

4946
03:23:25.916 --> 03:23:26.916
MATT: All right.

4947
03:23:28.141 --> 03:23:31.875
The rest of your party catches up to you.

4948
03:23:31.875 --> 03:23:35.464
Is there anything else you guys want to do in the interim?

4949
03:23:35.464 --> 03:23:38.714
MARISHA: All right, well, I'm super broke now.

4950
03:23:40.514 --> 03:23:41.347
TRAVIS: Why?

4951
03:23:42.423 --> 03:23:45.939
MARISHA: Well, I just bought us like a year-long,

4952
03:23:45.939 --> 03:23:48.861
like a forever membership to this place.

4953
03:23:48.861 --> 03:23:49.976
TRAVIS: Hey, that's great!

4954
03:23:49.976 --> 03:23:50.809
MARISHA: Yeah!

4955
03:23:50.809 --> 03:23:51.967
LIAM: Forever?

4956
03:23:51.967 --> 03:23:55.793
MARISHA: Well, we have access to the

4957
03:23:55.793 --> 03:23:59.377
teleportation circle in perpetuity.

4958
03:23:59.377 --> 03:24:01.063
LAURA: In perpetuity?

4959
03:24:01.063 --> 03:24:03.255
MARISHA: It just cost me 2000 gold.

4960
03:24:03.255 --> 03:24:04.740
TRAVIS: Oh!
TALIESIN: Wow.

4961
03:24:04.740 --> 03:24:05.961
MICA: And I might die.

4962
03:24:05.961 --> 03:24:06.794
LAURA: What?!

4963
03:24:06.794 --> 03:24:11.794
MARISHA: And Reani kind of signed up
for a six-month contract.

4964
03:24:12.090 --> 03:24:12.931
LAURA: What?!
MARISHA: Because they

4965
03:24:12.931 --> 03:24:17.931
originally wanted 500 gold.

4966
03:24:18.415 --> 03:24:20.236
SAM: You mean 5000?

4967
03:24:20.236 --> 03:24:21.423
MARISHA: No sorry, 500 platinum.

4968
03:24:21.423 --> 03:24:22.256
SAM: Oh.

4969
03:24:22.256 --> 03:24:23.506
MARISHA: So 5000 gold.

4970
03:24:24.457 --> 03:24:26.200
So we were able to talk them down,

4971
03:24:26.200 --> 03:24:29.685
we tried to go for a little bit less,

4972
03:24:29.685 --> 03:24:33.265
but they wanted 100 platinum for a month,

4973
03:24:33.265 --> 03:24:37.283
and I was like: Fucking ripoff.

4974
03:24:37.283 --> 03:24:39.258
LIAM: This is huge, though.

4975
03:24:39.258 --> 03:24:41.118
MARISHA: Is it? Is it good? Did I do a good thing?

4976
03:24:41.118 --> 03:24:41.951
TRAVIS: You did very well.

4977
03:24:41.951 --> 03:24:43.498
LAURA: We can come here forever!

4978
03:24:43.498 --> 03:24:44.937
MARISHA: Yeah, we can use it forever.

4979
03:24:44.937 --> 03:24:46.744
SAM: And it didn't cost us a thing.

4980
03:24:46.744 --> 03:24:47.577
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

4981
03:24:48.864 --> 03:24:51.042
LIAM: Let me cover half of that.

4982
03:24:51.042 --> 03:24:52.316
MARISHA: You have 1000 gold on you?

4983
03:24:52.316 --> 03:24:53.669
LIAM: I do.

4984
03:24:53.669 --> 03:24:54.622
MARISHA: Deal.

4985
03:24:54.622 --> 03:24:56.039
LAURA: I can help too.

4986
03:24:57.721 --> 03:24:59.206
LIAM: Let me get this.

4987
03:24:59.206 --> 03:25:01.503
MARISHA: Yeah, and I don't mind either.

4988
03:25:01.503 --> 03:25:02.953
I haven't paid for anything in a bit.

4989
03:25:02.953 --> 03:25:05.143
LIAM: You had the idea.

4990
03:25:05.143 --> 03:25:09.207
That seems like a really good deal for me.

4991
03:25:09.207 --> 03:25:11.714
MICA: Does this mean you guys will come back to visit?

4992
03:25:11.714 --> 03:25:14.312
SAM: Yes! This place is awesome.

4993
03:25:14.312 --> 03:25:16.154
TRAVIS: Fuck this place.

4994
03:25:16.154 --> 03:25:16.987
No, I'm just kidding.

4995
03:25:16.987 --> 03:25:19.570
(laughter)

4996
03:25:19.570 --> 03:25:22.279
SAM: So we need to reach out to Essek.

4997
03:25:22.279 --> 03:25:23.404
MICA: Who is Essek?

4998
03:25:23.404 --> 03:25:24.919
LAURA: He's our friend.

4999
03:25:24.919 --> 03:25:25.752
MICA: Is he nice?

5000
03:25:25.752 --> 03:25:27.160
SAM: He floats.
LAURA: He's super cool.

5001
03:25:27.160 --> 03:25:27.993
MICA: He floats?

5002
03:25:27.993 --> 03:25:32.293
LAURA: He floats and he's super duper hot.

5003
03:25:33.267 --> 03:25:35.904
Hot boi.
MICA: When can we go?

5004
03:25:35.904 --> 03:25:36.768
Can we go now?

5005
03:25:36.768 --> 03:25:37.677
SAM: Well, we got to talk to him first.

5006
03:25:37.677 --> 03:25:39.594
LAURA: We got to talk to him.

5007
03:25:40.462 --> 03:25:41.896
I'll talk to him.

5008
03:25:41.896 --> 03:25:43.015
MATT: All right.

5009
03:25:43.015 --> 03:25:45.598
I'm going to send him a message.

5010
03:25:47.896 --> 03:25:49.494
Okay.

5011
03:25:49.494 --> 03:25:52.494
Further developments on our mission.

5012
03:25:53.861 --> 03:25:58.111
We need your help again to travel a great distance.

5013
03:26:02.559 --> 03:26:05.517
It's of dire importance.

5014
03:26:05.517 --> 03:26:07.517
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: That's one word.

5015
03:26:10.662 --> 03:26:12.221
What do you think?

5016
03:26:12.221 --> 03:26:14.560
Can you...

5017
03:26:14.560 --> 03:26:16.810
(laughter)

5018
03:26:30.502 --> 03:26:31.680
MATT: "Why...

5019
03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:33.930
(laughter)

5020
03:26:40.607 --> 03:26:42.771
"If it is of dire importance,

5021
03:26:42.771 --> 03:26:44.438
"I will do what I can,

5022
03:26:46.413 --> 03:26:51.413
"but please, my skills are not

5023
03:26:51.437 --> 03:26:55.242
"given parlor tricks.

5024
03:26:55.242 --> 03:26:57.001
"Be mindful."

5025
03:26:57.001 --> 03:26:58.631
LAURA: I send a message back.

5026
03:26:58.631 --> 03:27:03.133
No no no no no, we don't think that!

5027
03:27:03.133 --> 03:27:07.513
You're very powerful and we just need your help!

5028
03:27:07.513 --> 03:27:09.930
We don't take it for granted.

5029
03:27:12.044 --> 03:27:13.970
Do do do do do.

5030
03:27:13.970 --> 03:27:14.803
MATT: That's the entire message?

5031
03:27:14.803 --> 03:27:15.636
LAURA: Yeah.

5032
03:27:19.894 --> 03:27:22.093
MATT: "Very well.

5033
03:27:22.093 --> 03:27:25.234
"I will

5034
03:27:25.234 --> 03:27:29.157
await your arrival in Rosohna

5035
03:27:29.157 --> 03:27:33.057
"and will do my best to be of aid."

5036
03:27:33.057 --> 03:27:34.850
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

5037
03:27:34.850 --> 03:27:36.791
He's going to help us,

5038
03:27:36.791 --> 03:27:41.027
we just got to get to Rosohna.

5039
03:27:41.027 --> 03:27:42.082
TRAVIS: That's great.

5040
03:27:42.082 --> 03:27:43.530
SAM: Good news, good news.

5041
03:27:43.530 --> 03:27:45.020
Have you ever been to Rosohna?

5042
03:27:45.020 --> 03:27:46.153
MICA: No.

5043
03:27:46.153 --> 03:27:47.167
LAURA: Ooh.

5044
03:27:47.167 --> 03:27:49.000
SAM: It's a little weird.

5045
03:27:50.016 --> 03:27:51.197
LAURA: It's very dark.

5046
03:27:51.197 --> 03:27:52.030
MICA: Oh.

5047
03:27:52.030 --> 03:27:54.097
LAURA: It's pretty dark here, isn't it, too,

5048
03:27:54.097 --> 03:27:55.374
because we're underground.

5049
03:27:55.374 --> 03:27:58.565
SAM: Do you think that, I mean,

5050
03:27:58.565 --> 03:28:02.582
do you think that she'll be accepted there?

5051
03:28:02.582 --> 03:28:03.726
LIAM: She's with us.

5052
03:28:03.726 --> 03:28:05.068
LAURA: You might get some looks.

5053
03:28:05.068 --> 03:28:06.504
MICA: I have a hood.

5054
03:28:06.504 --> 03:28:10.541
If anybody tries to hurt me, I'll stab them.

5055
03:28:10.541 --> 03:28:11.549
SAM: Yeah!

5056
03:28:11.549 --> 03:28:16.090
TRAVIS: Well, maybe we lay low on the stabbing outright,

5057
03:28:16.090 --> 03:28:20.168
and I don't know if the hood will hide your--

5058
03:28:20.168 --> 03:28:21.330
SAM: Does it hide your--
TRAVIS: Light?

5059
03:28:21.330 --> 03:28:22.755
MICA: No.

5060
03:28:22.755 --> 03:28:23.588
TRAVIS: Right.

5061
03:28:23.588 --> 03:28:26.850
Have we ever seen anyone that had

5062
03:28:26.850 --> 03:28:28.568
a halo of light above their head?

5063
03:28:28.568 --> 03:28:29.401
MATT: No.

5064
03:28:29.401 --> 03:28:31.685
SAM: When you're in your beast form,

5065
03:28:31.685 --> 03:28:32.940
do you still have the halo?

5066
03:28:32.940 --> 03:28:34.595
MICA: Uh-huh.

5067
03:28:34.595 --> 03:28:37.012
SAM: Is there any way to dim it?

5068
03:28:38.929 --> 03:28:40.893
MICA: No one can see it if they're dead!

5069
03:28:40.893 --> 03:28:42.068
TRAVIS: Okay.

5070
03:28:42.068 --> 03:28:44.238
Not what we're going for.

5071
03:28:44.238 --> 03:28:45.071
TALIESIN: That's true.

5072
03:28:45.071 --> 03:28:46.566
SAM: What if you put on a hat?

5073
03:28:46.566 --> 03:28:48.250
Does it conceal it a little?

5074
03:28:48.250 --> 03:28:49.416
MICA: No.

5075
03:28:49.416 --> 03:28:50.382
SAM: It just goes around the hat

5076
03:28:50.382 --> 03:28:51.340
no matter how big the hat is?

5077
03:28:51.340 --> 03:28:52.573
MICA: Yeah, and I put up my hood

5078
03:28:52.573 --> 03:28:54.671
to show them the halo's still there.

5079
03:28:54.671 --> 03:28:55.504
SAM: Wow.

5080
03:28:55.504 --> 03:28:57.254
LAURA: That's really cool.

5081
03:28:58.089 --> 03:29:02.220
TRAVIS: We're actually favored people of this Dynasty,

5082
03:29:02.220 --> 03:29:05.472
so they tend not to mess with us, you should be fine.

5083
03:29:05.472 --> 03:29:06.455
MICA: So no stabbing.

5084
03:29:06.455 --> 03:29:08.012
TRAVIS: No.
MICA: Poisoning?

5085
03:29:08.012 --> 03:29:10.277
LAURA: No no no.
MICA: Okay.

5086
03:29:10.277 --> 03:29:12.258
MARISHA: Does this keep you up at night?

5087
03:29:12.258 --> 03:29:13.380
MICA: No, I've learned to live with it.

5088
03:29:13.380 --> 03:29:14.246
MARISHA: Oh.
MICA: Yeah.

5089
03:29:14.246 --> 03:29:17.566
MARISHA: It's just a little neon light all the time.

5090
03:29:17.566 --> 03:29:18.787
MICA: It dims when I sleep.

5091
03:29:18.787 --> 03:29:20.703
LAURA: Does it?
MICA: That's what I've been told.

5092
03:29:20.703 --> 03:29:22.027
MARISHA: It dims when you sleep?

5093
03:29:22.027 --> 03:29:23.605
MICA: Yeah.

5094
03:29:23.605 --> 03:29:27.425
LIAM: Do you mind if we use your home to jump?

5095
03:29:27.425 --> 03:29:29.118
MICA: Please!

5096
03:29:29.118 --> 03:29:30.727
Only if I can cook dinner.

5097
03:29:30.727 --> 03:29:32.068
SAM: Sure. Let's go.

5098
03:29:32.068 --> 03:29:33.916
LIAM and TALIESIN: All right.

5099
03:29:33.916 --> 03:29:35.182
MICA: Yeah?
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

5100
03:29:35.182 --> 03:29:36.598
MICA: Well, let's go then!
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

5101
03:29:36.598 --> 03:29:37.431
MATT: All right.

5102
03:29:37.431 --> 03:29:39.256
Just as a note, you have not yet inspected

5103
03:29:39.256 --> 03:29:41.029
the circle at the Steeple.

5104
03:29:41.029 --> 03:29:43.163
LAURA: Oh yeah, you probably should do that.

5105
03:29:43.163 --> 03:29:44.196
LIAM: Yeah.

5106
03:29:44.196 --> 03:29:47.655
Caleb knew that; Liam's an idiot.

5107
03:29:47.655 --> 03:29:49.748
MARISHA: I wanted to pop back in anyway real quick

5108
03:29:49.748 --> 03:29:52.552
before we left because I forgot something.

5109
03:29:52.552 --> 03:29:54.677
LIAM: Well, let's go, you can run your errand.

5110
03:29:54.677 --> 03:29:56.640
(laughter)

5111
03:29:56.640 --> 03:29:57.485
Here's your deal.

5112
03:29:57.485 --> 03:29:58.928
(laughter)

5113
03:29:58.928 --> 03:30:00.845
MARISHA: Steal the money back.

5114
03:30:02.593 --> 03:30:03.616
MATT: All right, you head back to the Steeple

5115
03:30:03.616 --> 03:30:07.128
as the rest of you are gathering over at Reani's house.

5116
03:30:07.128 --> 03:30:09.139
LAURA: That's good because it's time to prep dinner.

5117
03:30:09.139 --> 03:30:09.972
MICA: Dinnertime.

5118
03:30:09.972 --> 03:30:12.431
MARISHA: (ringing)

5119
03:30:12.431 --> 03:30:16.352
MATT: You enter, the old woman dwarf looks up and goes,

5120
03:30:16.352 --> 03:30:18.083
"You've certainly come in a lot today!"

5121
03:30:18.083 --> 03:30:19.200
MARISHA: Sorry.

5122
03:30:19.200 --> 03:30:20.783
MATT: "What do you need?"

5123
03:30:21.782 --> 03:30:23.007
MARISHA: We need to take a peek at that

5124
03:30:23.007 --> 03:30:24.803
fancy-schmancy teleportation

5125
03:30:24.803 --> 03:30:28.970
that I just spent a lot of money to get access to.

5126
03:30:29.842 --> 03:30:32.013
MATT: "I'll get the Scribewarden.

5127
03:30:32.013 --> 03:30:32.846
"(grunts)"

5128
03:30:32.846 --> 03:30:33.796
She gets up and wanders off,

5129
03:30:33.796 --> 03:30:37.480
the Scribewarden is retrieved, and,

5130
03:30:37.480 --> 03:30:39.954
"Ah, very quick are you to take

5131
03:30:39.954 --> 03:30:42.083
"of this particular arrangement."

5132
03:30:42.083 --> 03:30:44.458
MARISHA: Well, you know WHAT they say.

5133
03:30:44.458 --> 03:30:46.411
Lucky number three.

5134
03:30:46.411 --> 03:30:48.191
We won't bother you any more after this.

5135
03:30:48.191 --> 03:30:49.608
LIAM: Going to maximize our use of it.

5136
03:30:49.608 --> 03:30:53.789
Also, I would like to apologize for my wife

5137
03:30:53.789 --> 03:30:57.295
and my domestic squabble (laughter).

5138
03:30:57.295 --> 03:30:59.922
MATT: "How is your rib doing?"

5139
03:30:59.922 --> 03:31:04.540
LIAM: We have some very accomplished healers in the group.

5140
03:31:04.540 --> 03:31:07.704
MATT: "I hope you have very accomplished therapists as well.

5141
03:31:07.704 --> 03:31:09.154
"Come."

5142
03:31:10.745 --> 03:31:14.415
Leads you guys back from the doorway where you saw

5143
03:31:14.415 --> 03:31:17.189
the people you were gathering entering and exiting

5144
03:31:17.189 --> 03:31:18.772
what you hadn't been in before.

5145
03:31:18.772 --> 03:31:20.857
You are stepping into

5146
03:31:20.857 --> 03:31:25.400
what looks like a sprawling library,

5147
03:31:25.400 --> 03:31:29.551
similar to some of the Cobalt Soul

5148
03:31:29.551 --> 03:31:32.711
libraries that you've come across.

5149
03:31:32.711 --> 03:31:35.701
You can see a lot of them are scrolls as opposed to books,

5150
03:31:35.701 --> 03:31:37.654
like Library of Alexandria style,

5151
03:31:37.654 --> 03:31:40.786
stacked up in sections with labels

5152
03:31:40.786 --> 03:31:42.652
and various notes set aside.

5153
03:31:42.652 --> 03:31:43.928
LIAM: Some "I, Claudius" shit.

5154
03:31:43.928 --> 03:31:44.761
MATT: Yeah.

5155
03:31:46.086 --> 03:31:50.028
It's not as big, comparatively, as some of the libraries.

5156
03:31:50.028 --> 03:31:52.290
There are sections where you can see

5157
03:31:52.290 --> 03:31:54.219
areas of very well guarded and so it looks

5158
03:31:54.219 --> 03:31:58.446
and actually a lot of these appear to be damaged.

5159
03:31:58.446 --> 03:32:00.788
MARISHA: Can I tell what kind of damage?

5160
03:32:00.788 --> 03:32:02.781
MATT: Make a perception check.

5161
03:32:02.781 --> 03:32:04.688
MARISHA: Why is it never investigation?

5162
03:32:04.688 --> 03:32:06.366
MATT: If you want to get close, you can investigate it.

5163
03:32:06.366 --> 03:32:07.708
MARISHA: Will I get in trouble?

5164
03:32:07.708 --> 03:32:09.868
MATT: You don't know until you try.

5165
03:32:09.868 --> 03:32:10.701
LAURA: Try.

5166
03:32:11.818 --> 03:32:12.893
TALIESIN: That sounds like a dare to me.

5167
03:32:12.893 --> 03:32:14.023
LAURA: ♪ Roll the dice! ♪

5168
03:32:14.023 --> 03:32:16.920
MARISHA: It's always a dare, and I have to--

5169
03:32:16.920 --> 03:32:18.595
TRAVIS: You just spent all this money

5170
03:32:18.595 --> 03:32:19.520
MICA: Get re-kicked out.

5171
03:32:19.520 --> 03:32:21.633
MATT: The section of predominantly damaged books

5172
03:32:21.633 --> 03:32:24.265
is surrounded with similarly dressed individuals

5173
03:32:24.265 --> 03:32:25.756
as the ones that you saw referred to

5174
03:32:25.756 --> 03:32:28.783
as the Woodset <i>Auditors.</i>

5175
03:32:28.783 --> 03:32:31.091
TRAVIS: (high-pitched animal cry)

5176
03:32:32.399 --> 03:32:35.107
MARISHA: I don't want to Red Rover them because I know

5177
03:32:35.107 --> 03:32:37.633
they're holding hands and they're super adorable,

5178
03:32:37.633 --> 03:32:40.490
but, if I could--

5179
03:32:40.490 --> 03:32:42.443
TALIESIN: It's why they call them aww-ditors.

5180
03:32:42.443 --> 03:32:43.276
MICA and LAURA: Aww!

5181
03:32:44.576 --> 03:32:46.322
TALIESIN: I'm done, that was my one.

5182
03:32:46.322 --> 03:32:48.253
MATT: Ah, you guys put so much faith in a Teleport spell.

5183
03:32:48.253 --> 03:32:49.648
(laughter)

5184
03:32:49.648 --> 03:32:50.481
TALIESIN: We're so fucked.

5185
03:32:50.481 --> 03:32:53.925
MARISHA: Can I swing wide and take a look?

5186
03:32:53.925 --> 03:32:56.621
LIAM: Yes, you can try to do that.

5187
03:32:56.621 --> 03:32:58.425
This is such a bumblefuck of an episode.

5188
03:32:58.425 --> 03:32:59.580
MATT: Make a stealth check

5189
03:32:59.580 --> 03:33:01.774
to see if you can peel off for a moment

5190
03:33:01.774 --> 03:33:03.471
to get close enough.

5191
03:33:03.471 --> 03:33:04.304
MARISHA: Okay.

5192
03:33:05.243 --> 03:33:06.155
22.

5193
03:33:06.155 --> 03:33:07.051
MATT: 22.

5194
03:33:07.051 --> 03:33:09.496
You find a moment where you peel off away

5195
03:33:09.496 --> 03:33:11.375
from the periphery of the Scribewarden

5196
03:33:11.375 --> 03:33:13.593
and get close enough to look over the shoulder of

5197
03:33:13.593 --> 03:33:15.593
a few of these auditors.

5198
03:33:17.376 --> 03:33:18.209
Good.

5199
03:33:19.898 --> 03:33:22.775
Glance past and take a deep bit of interest,

5200
03:33:22.775 --> 03:33:24.006
now roll a perception check.

5201
03:33:24.006 --> 03:33:25.076
Or no, investigation for this one,

5202
03:33:25.076 --> 03:33:26.185
because you got plus one for investigation.

5203
03:33:26.185 --> 03:33:27.602
MARISHA: I know, I know.

5204
03:33:29.178 --> 03:33:30.120
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

5205
03:33:30.120 --> 03:33:31.011
MARISHA: Shut up.

5206
03:33:31.011 --> 03:33:33.261
I don't need this from you.

5207
03:33:35.657 --> 03:33:36.758
11.

5208
03:33:36.758 --> 03:33:38.426
No!

5209
03:33:38.426 --> 03:33:39.261
10.

5210
03:33:39.261 --> 03:33:41.072
TALIESIN: Oh!

5211
03:33:41.072 --> 03:33:41.979
MATT: It's hard to tell.

5212
03:33:41.979 --> 03:33:44.463
(laughter)

5213
03:33:44.463 --> 03:33:47.705
The pages look sullied and at first glance,

5214
03:33:47.705 --> 03:33:52.401
seems just filthier or oil or some sort of contaminant

5215
03:33:52.401 --> 03:33:55.429
like they were just drudged up out an ocean floor,

5216
03:33:55.429 --> 03:34:00.429
but the coloration is continuously purple.

5217
03:34:00.608 --> 03:34:02.208
The tint is purple.

5218
03:34:02.208 --> 03:34:03.927
Which leads you to be different, that's as much as you get.

5219
03:34:03.927 --> 03:34:05.966
MARISHA: Okay, that's something, I got something.

5220
03:34:05.966 --> 03:34:07.257
MATT: You got something with a 10.
TRAVIS: It was a Color Run.

5221
03:34:07.257 --> 03:34:08.090
MARISHA: Yeah.

5222
03:34:08.951 --> 03:34:11.759
MATT: Then you hear, (throat clearing)

5223
03:34:11.759 --> 03:34:13.378
and the Scribewarden's looking back,

5224
03:34:13.378 --> 03:34:15.946
in your direction as you're sliding back up.

5225
03:34:15.946 --> 03:34:17.213
MARISHA: 45 foot movement speed.

5226
03:34:17.213 --> 03:34:18.046
MATT: Yeah. (whooshing)

5227
03:34:18.046 --> 03:34:20.660
The Scribewarden seems kind of,

5228
03:34:20.660 --> 03:34:23.165
you just ninja catted her essentially.

5229
03:34:23.165 --> 03:34:27.151
Caleb is very innocent-faced and just ogling everything.

5230
03:34:27.151 --> 03:34:30.068
He hasn't been by books in forever.

5231
03:34:30.931 --> 03:34:32.983
You are brought towards the very back

5232
03:34:32.983 --> 03:34:35.601
and center of this large open chamber,

5233
03:34:35.601 --> 03:34:37.431
and you can see now it's called the Steeple because

5234
03:34:37.431 --> 03:34:40.472
the center of it, it's just that rising part of the temple,

5235
03:34:40.472 --> 03:34:45.472
it's this ever, this extremely tall

5236
03:34:45.727 --> 03:34:49.396
gradually gathering point,

5237
03:34:49.396 --> 03:34:51.042
a tower from the inside

5238
03:34:51.042 --> 03:34:54.470
and each 15-foot or 20-foot height

5239
03:34:54.470 --> 03:34:56.995
has a small walkway

5240
03:34:56.995 --> 03:34:59.130
and a staircase that goes up another smaller walkway

5241
03:34:59.130 --> 03:35:00.031
and a staircase that goes up.

5242
03:35:00.031 --> 03:35:00.882
It's like being in Luxor,

5243
03:35:00.882 --> 03:35:02.803
where you look up where all the hotel floors

5244
03:35:02.803 --> 03:35:03.828
that descend to the top,

5245
03:35:03.828 --> 03:35:06.328
and it's much more of a point.

5246
03:35:08.964 --> 03:35:10.321
Right in the center of all that,

5247
03:35:10.321 --> 03:35:14.528
you can see on the ground is a very familiar

5248
03:35:14.528 --> 03:35:18.272
chiseled sigil representing a teleportation circle.

5249
03:35:18.272 --> 03:35:21.367
As you approach, the Scribewarden says,

5250
03:35:21.367 --> 03:35:23.434
"Just so you're aware, this,

5251
03:35:23.434 --> 03:35:25.434
"to step into this circle

5252
03:35:26.438 --> 03:35:29.986
"will send you to Palebank Village

5253
03:35:29.986 --> 03:35:32.497
"which is a bit northwest of here

5254
03:35:32.497 --> 03:35:35.470
"and is involved in our excavations

5255
03:35:35.470 --> 03:35:37.237
"of Eiselcross to the north.

5256
03:35:37.237 --> 03:35:40.125
"That is not of interest to you

5257
03:35:40.125 --> 03:35:42.627
"and I would hate for you to be suddenly stranded

5258
03:35:42.627 --> 03:35:45.661
"in such a small podunk place.

5259
03:35:47.440 --> 03:35:51.237
"However, should this be an element of your returning,

5260
03:35:51.237 --> 03:35:55.365
"to it, it does act as an anchor for such circles

5261
03:35:55.365 --> 03:35:58.701
"which I assume is why you're so interested in this."

5262
03:35:58.701 --> 03:36:00.111
Looking straight towards you.

5263
03:36:00.111 --> 03:36:03.790
LIAM: Well, we have business here and business elsewhere

5264
03:36:03.790 --> 03:36:07.031
so we need to be able to return here expediently.

5265
03:36:07.031 --> 03:36:07.864
MATT: "Good.

5266
03:36:08.960 --> 03:36:12.459
"Then, come here and meet the guardians of the circle

5267
03:36:12.459 --> 03:36:13.718
"so they know what to look for

5268
03:36:13.718 --> 03:36:18.020
"so you aren't immediately assailed when you return."

5269
03:36:18.020 --> 03:36:19.205
Introduces you to

5270
03:36:19.205 --> 03:36:21.027
a set of four different guardians,

5271
03:36:21.027 --> 03:36:24.222
they all take note, you know,

5272
03:36:24.222 --> 03:36:25.688
they meet you briefly,

5273
03:36:25.688 --> 03:36:27.539
take a very intense look over each of you,

5274
03:36:27.539 --> 03:36:30.288
some of them sketch a bit and take notes.

5275
03:36:30.288 --> 03:36:31.242
That seems sufficient enough

5276
03:36:31.242 --> 03:36:33.534
to the point where you won't be attacked on sight

5277
03:36:33.534 --> 03:36:34.946
for suddenly appearing in the middle of

5278
03:36:34.946 --> 03:36:37.226
a very closely guarded.

5279
03:36:37.226 --> 03:36:39.678
LIAM: Give a brief description
of our friends who are not here.

5280
03:36:39.678 --> 03:36:40.511
MATT: All right.

5281
03:36:40.511 --> 03:36:43.411
LIAM: I am the one who will be piloting the expedition.

5282
03:36:43.411 --> 03:36:44.244
Thank you.

5283
03:36:45.088 --> 03:36:46.088
MATT: "Very well.

5284
03:36:48.762 --> 03:36:51.441
"Do you require anything else?"

5285
03:36:51.441 --> 03:36:53.965
MARISHA: Is there any type of certificate or documentation

5286
03:36:53.965 --> 03:36:57.176
that we need to show to the people at the front desk

5287
03:36:57.176 --> 03:37:01.001
so we don't have to bother you every time we come in?

5288
03:37:01.001 --> 03:37:02.993
Or so that we can get our

5289
03:37:02.993 --> 03:37:06.818
very hefty transaction in writing?

5290
03:37:09.295 --> 03:37:11.761
MATT: "A contract I can draw up, yes."

5291
03:37:11.761 --> 03:37:13.385
MARISHA: Thank you.

5292
03:37:13.385 --> 03:37:16.250
MATT: "But I do have to be present whenever you're here,

5293
03:37:16.250 --> 03:37:19.633
"so do not try to abuse this."

5294
03:37:19.633 --> 03:37:21.559
LIAM: So not today, but does this deal

5295
03:37:21.559 --> 03:37:23.912
mean that I have access to the archives again?

5296
03:37:23.912 --> 03:37:25.053
MATT: "No."
LIAM: Okay.

5297
03:37:25.053 --> 03:37:26.561
MATT: "It was for the circle."

5298
03:37:26.561 --> 03:37:28.661
(laughter)

5299
03:37:31.736 --> 03:37:33.005
TALIESIN: Wow.

5300
03:37:33.005 --> 03:37:35.296
MATT: The contract is written up and you now have

5301
03:37:35.296 --> 03:37:37.548
in your disposal and you can add it to your

5302
03:37:37.548 --> 03:37:38.941
equipment section of your character sheet

5303
03:37:38.941 --> 03:37:43.146
that you have a contract with the Scribewarden.

5304
03:37:43.146 --> 03:37:44.442
LIAM: Just a little (squishing)

5305
03:37:44.442 --> 03:37:46.889
MATT: I know, I know. Sorry, buddy.

5306
03:37:46.889 --> 03:37:48.238
LIAM: Yeah, great, good stuff.

5307
03:37:48.238 --> 03:37:50.353
TALIESIN: Caleb's heart broke that day.

5308
03:37:50.353 --> 03:37:52.565
Took it to be repaired.

5309
03:37:52.565 --> 03:37:55.529
MARISHA: All right, we go back to everybody else.

5310
03:37:55.529 --> 03:37:57.483
SAM: Should we rest a night and then go

5311
03:37:57.483 --> 03:37:59.566
or go now and rest there?

5312
03:38:01.329 --> 03:38:03.367
LIAM: I think we should rest there, I think we should go.

5313
03:38:03.367 --> 03:38:05.543
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: All right.

5314
03:38:05.543 --> 03:38:06.836
MARISHA: We have dinner first though, right?

5315
03:38:06.836 --> 03:38:09.233
LIAM: They're making dinner.

5316
03:38:09.233 --> 03:38:10.739
TALIESIN: I think we've been making dinner while you go out.

5317
03:38:10.739 --> 03:38:11.572
LAURA: What did we make?

5318
03:38:11.572 --> 03:38:13.389
MICA: Grilled goat with assorted veggies.

5319
03:38:13.389 --> 03:38:14.589
SAM: Ooh!
TALIESIN: Spiced.

5320
03:38:14.589 --> 03:38:16.505
MICA: Spiced. Absolutely.

5321
03:38:16.505 --> 03:38:17.626
TALIESIN: I have good stuff.

5322
03:38:17.626 --> 03:38:18.740
MICA: And a rice pilaf.

5323
03:38:18.740 --> 03:38:20.157
MARISHA: Oh my god, yes.

5324
03:38:21.155 --> 03:38:26.155
MICA: And then after dinner, some mulled wine.

5325
03:38:26.523 --> 03:38:28.223
LAURA: What about baked goods, probably a big cake?

5326
03:38:28.223 --> 03:38:30.453
MICA: Absolutely, yeah.

5327
03:38:30.453 --> 03:38:33.277
MARISHA: This is making me emotional.

5328
03:38:33.277 --> 03:38:36.532
MICA: It's a cake, and then poorly frosted
is everybody's face

5329
03:38:36.532 --> 03:38:38.344
but like, it looks really bad.

5330
03:38:38.344 --> 03:38:40.783
LAURA: No, I definitely helped with that,

5331
03:38:40.783 --> 03:38:43.084
so it looks pretty good.

5332
03:38:43.084 --> 03:38:45.388
MICA: I take it back, it's a beautifully frosted cake.

5333
03:38:45.388 --> 03:38:46.221
MATT: Make--

5334
03:38:48.319 --> 03:38:49.152
SAM: (whispered) Performance.

5335
03:38:49.152 --> 03:38:50.686
MATT: Make a performance check, yeah.

5336
03:38:50.686 --> 03:38:52.052
Yeah, I was going to say either performance or dexterity,

5337
03:38:52.052 --> 03:38:53.430
I was like no, that'll be a performance check.

5338
03:38:53.430 --> 03:38:54.843
MICA: Make a frosting check.

5339
03:38:54.843 --> 03:38:55.676
MATT: That's exactly what this is,

5340
03:38:55.676 --> 03:38:58.301
this is frosting technique.

5341
03:38:59.768 --> 03:39:00.893
TRAVIS: How's your performance?

5342
03:39:00.893 --> 03:39:05.452
LAURA: My performance is not good, but that's a 19.

5343
03:39:05.452 --> 03:39:06.628
MATT: It's pretty impeccable.

5344
03:39:06.628 --> 03:39:09.565
For the limited icing resources that they have here

5345
03:39:09.565 --> 03:39:11.726
that you've managed to accrue over time,

5346
03:39:11.726 --> 03:39:15.279
or through favors at the local bakeries in the area,

5347
03:39:15.279 --> 03:39:18.635
you pull off some decent mixtures and color shade,

5348
03:39:18.635 --> 03:39:19.636
transitions and stuff,

5349
03:39:19.636 --> 03:39:21.460
where there's actually a little bit of shadow elements--

5350
03:39:21.460 --> 03:39:22.599
MICA: Duff Goldman would be proud.

5351
03:39:22.599 --> 03:39:23.758
MATT: Oh yeah, straight up.

5352
03:39:23.758 --> 03:39:25.987
MICA: Yeah, Ace of Cakes.

5353
03:39:25.987 --> 03:39:27.547
TALIESIN: I don't know how you got the glowing lichen

5354
03:39:27.547 --> 03:39:29.996
to work like that, but that's really impressive.

5355
03:39:29.996 --> 03:39:32.083
MICA: I'm going to let you know: moss.

5356
03:39:32.083 --> 03:39:34.512
TALIESIN: Wow!
MICA: I know. Crazy.

5357
03:39:34.512 --> 03:39:35.768
TALIESIN: Is there anything it can't do?

5358
03:39:35.768 --> 03:39:37.993
(laughter)

5359
03:39:38.943 --> 03:39:41.885
MATT: All right, so your meal is

5360
03:39:41.885 --> 03:39:43.662
much better than you were expecting

5361
03:39:43.662 --> 03:39:47.412
for a podunk portion of the city of Uthodurn.

5362
03:39:48.968 --> 03:39:51.002
The rest of the evening is yours.

5363
03:39:51.002 --> 03:39:52.075
SAM: We're going to go back now?

5364
03:39:52.075 --> 03:39:53.325
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: All right.

5365
03:39:53.325 --> 03:39:54.870
Fire it up, how do we do this?

5366
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:57.068
LIAM: It takes a little bit of time to write on the floors,

5367
03:39:57.068 --> 03:39:59.898
is it okay if I use these chalks here?

5368
03:39:59.898 --> 03:40:01.455
MICA: Yeah, do you want a different color?

5369
03:40:01.455 --> 03:40:03.141
LIAM: No, I'm all set, thank you.

5370
03:40:03.141 --> 03:40:05.883
LAURA: When he is drawing that up,

5371
03:40:05.883 --> 03:40:09.336
I'm just going to send a real quick message to Yeza.

5372
03:40:09.336 --> 03:40:11.309
SAM: Oh, thank you!

5373
03:40:11.309 --> 03:40:12.870
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

5374
03:40:12.870 --> 03:40:14.257
SAM: What are you going to say?

5375
03:40:14.257 --> 03:40:15.174
LAURA: Hey Yeza.

5376
03:40:16.083 --> 03:40:18.912
Found out Nugget really likes ground nuts,

5377
03:40:18.912 --> 03:40:20.853
like in a meal form,

5378
03:40:20.853 --> 03:40:22.391
because I don't think we've been

5379
03:40:22.391 --> 03:40:23.849
feeding him the right things.

5380
03:40:23.849 --> 03:40:25.405
SAM: Also, how's my family?

5381
03:40:25.405 --> 03:40:27.502
LAURA: Also, how's the fam?

5382
03:40:27.502 --> 03:40:31.990
MATT: "How's the--" is about where it ends.

5383
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:34.320
"Oh, I had no idea.

5384
03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:35.507
"That's good to know.

5385
03:40:35.507 --> 03:40:40.166
"I'll go ahead and get some posthaste.

5386
03:40:40.166 --> 03:40:42.816
"I assume you meant family?

5387
03:40:44.435 --> 03:40:46.208
"All is well.

5388
03:40:46.208 --> 03:40:47.199
"Just miss my--"

5389
03:40:47.199 --> 03:40:49.399
And like-- (laughter)

5390
03:40:51.130 --> 03:40:53.297
Somewhere in the neighborhood.

5391
03:40:54.189 --> 03:40:56.384
So that's your response.

5392
03:40:56.384 --> 03:40:57.279
LAURA: They're good, they're good.

5393
03:40:57.279 --> 03:40:58.112
SAM: Perfect.

5394
03:40:58.112 --> 03:40:59.756
MATT: You finish the circle creation,

5395
03:40:59.756 --> 03:41:02.980
mark down the components utilized for that.

5396
03:41:02.980 --> 03:41:04.248
LIAM: I have to get more.

5397
03:41:04.248 --> 03:41:06.823
LAURA: I think he was going to say
he misses me a lot, though.

5398
03:41:06.823 --> 03:41:10.383
TALIESIN: We need more before we
end up where we're ending up?

5399
03:41:10.383 --> 03:41:12.460
LIAM: We can get some in Rosohna.

5400
03:41:12.460 --> 03:41:14.657
MICA: Also, before we take off,

5401
03:41:14.657 --> 03:41:16.816
I finished everyone's flower crowns

5402
03:41:16.816 --> 03:41:19.521
and have delivered them to everyone so now everyone matches.

5403
03:41:19.521 --> 03:41:22.233
MATT: Each of you have matching flower crowns

5404
03:41:22.233 --> 03:41:23.552
in your inventory.

5405
03:41:23.552 --> 03:41:25.715
Do with it as you will.

5406
03:41:25.715 --> 03:41:28.628
TALIESIN: I'm putting mine on my head and I'm starting

5407
03:41:28.628 --> 03:41:32.008
my spell to get it to start sprouting mushrooms in the game.

5408
03:41:32.008 --> 03:41:33.642
MATT: The flower crown immediately begins to,

5409
03:41:33.642 --> 03:41:36.020
and much more rapidly than you expected,

5410
03:41:36.020 --> 03:41:38.883
to produce unique and alien-looking fungus

5411
03:41:38.883 --> 03:41:43.518
that in some ways blends and contrasts with the hair color

5412
03:41:43.518 --> 03:41:45.965
which is transitioning away from pink a little bit.

5413
03:41:45.965 --> 03:41:47.206
TALIESIN: A little bit.

5414
03:41:47.206 --> 03:41:48.385
MARISHA: Wait, what's happening?

5415
03:41:48.385 --> 03:41:49.494
TALIESIN: It's just getting a little...

5416
03:41:49.494 --> 03:41:51.386
SAM: He isn't eating enough salmon or something.

5417
03:41:51.386 --> 03:41:55.716
TALIESIN: Well, we've been in a bit of a rough environment.

5418
03:41:55.716 --> 03:41:57.071
LAURA: What color is it turning?

5419
03:41:57.071 --> 03:41:59.062
TALIESIN: It's still pink,
it's just getting a little lighter,

5420
03:41:59.062 --> 03:42:02.412
and there's also some new colors in the lichen

5421
03:42:02.412 --> 03:42:05.055
and I've got some interesting blue glowing lichens

5422
03:42:05.055 --> 03:42:07.358
starting to spread on my right side.

5423
03:42:07.358 --> 03:42:08.751
MICA: What can make your hair pink again?

5424
03:42:08.751 --> 03:42:12.229
TALIESIN: Oh, that's just a better environment

5425
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:14.775
for what turns it pink, it's just been,

5426
03:42:14.775 --> 03:42:16.445
it's not been a lot of sunlight.

5427
03:42:16.445 --> 03:42:18.494
MICA: I'm going to Druidcraft a small pink flower

5428
03:42:18.494 --> 03:42:21.657
and place it on top of your head

5429
03:42:21.657 --> 03:42:23.928
but I have to climb up on a chair, I'm assuming--

5430
03:42:23.928 --> 03:42:24.830
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm really tall.

5431
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:26.176
MICA: To place it on top of your head.

5432
03:42:26.176 --> 03:42:27.593
MATT: Problem solved.

5433
03:42:29.288 --> 03:42:30.850
All right.

5434
03:42:30.850 --> 03:42:33.262
At this point, while you guys are having this conversation,

5435
03:42:33.262 --> 03:42:37.071
Caleb, you finish the spell and you have in your hand

5436
03:42:37.071 --> 03:42:40.927
the final component to trigger the very brief instant

5437
03:42:40.927 --> 03:42:42.658
in which the circle is active.

5438
03:42:42.658 --> 03:42:45.174
LIAM: Flower crown still on my head, okay.

5439
03:42:45.174 --> 03:42:46.405
Are we ready to go?

5440
03:42:46.405 --> 03:42:48.620
This is very quick, so you have to jump in right away

5441
03:42:48.620 --> 03:42:50.675
as soon as I make this last mark.

5442
03:42:50.675 --> 03:42:51.874
MICA: On it.
LIAM: Okay.

5443
03:42:51.874 --> 03:42:52.716
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

5444
03:42:52.716 --> 03:42:55.443
LIAM: Right, <i>eins, zwei, drei.</i>

5445
03:42:55.443 --> 03:42:57.675
MATT: As soon as he does that, you watch all the

5446
03:42:57.675 --> 03:42:59.261
scrawlings on the ground (whooshing)

5447
03:42:59.261 --> 03:43:02.149
light up with extremely strong whitish,

5448
03:43:02.149 --> 03:43:03.927
almost golden light,

5449
03:43:03.927 --> 03:43:05.785
and you watch as one by one, they all jump in,

5450
03:43:05.785 --> 03:43:08.605
vanish. (whooshing)

5451
03:43:08.605 --> 03:43:10.029
You go with them?
MICA: Yeah.

5452
03:43:10.029 --> 03:43:11.287
MATT: (whooshing) There's a moment where all of a sudden,

5453
03:43:11.287 --> 03:43:13.192
the ground leaves your feet.

5454
03:43:13.192 --> 03:43:14.902
There is no color, no light,

5455
03:43:14.902 --> 03:43:18.926
just the sensation of being pushed through a void expanse.

5456
03:43:18.926 --> 03:43:20.919
Your stomach suddenly knots up in

5457
03:43:20.919 --> 03:43:23.702
that butterfly-type feeling in your stomach

5458
03:43:23.702 --> 03:43:25.558
and then (whooshing) your feet find ground

5459
03:43:25.558 --> 03:43:29.634
and you are inside of a darkly lit, subterranean chamber

5460
03:43:29.634 --> 03:43:32.835
of gray rock, very smoothly carved,

5461
03:43:32.835 --> 03:43:34.994
and a bunch of soldiers around suddenly turning

5462
03:43:34.994 --> 03:43:39.077
with spears, wearing strange, metallic armor

5463
03:43:39.077 --> 03:43:43.694
that looks organic or chitinous with helmets and

5464
03:43:45.369 --> 03:43:47.824
probably one of the first times in a long time

5465
03:43:47.824 --> 03:43:49.772
that you've seen drow.

5466
03:43:49.772 --> 03:43:50.768
MICA: Oh.

5467
03:43:50.768 --> 03:43:54.185
Well, first, I turn and vom a little bit.

5468
03:43:55.052 --> 03:43:56.414
TALIESIN: Yep, that'll, that'll--

5469
03:43:56.414 --> 03:43:59.103
MATT: The weapons relax.
MICA: It's not fun, it's not great.

5470
03:43:59.103 --> 03:44:00.915
SAM: Show our symbols.

5471
03:44:00.915 --> 03:44:02.164
MATT: Yep.

5472
03:44:02.164 --> 03:44:06.722
They escort you through hallways into this

5473
03:44:06.722 --> 03:44:08.814
grandiose-looking walkway

5474
03:44:08.814 --> 03:44:11.760
that you've never seen something quite so large,

5475
03:44:11.760 --> 03:44:15.901
it's like a cathedral of muted color palette,

5476
03:44:15.901 --> 03:44:17.650
but still beautiful and perfunctory

5477
03:44:17.650 --> 03:44:19.242
in the colors that do push out which are

5478
03:44:19.242 --> 03:44:22.824
bright purples and greens and subtle reds.

5479
03:44:22.824 --> 03:44:26.314
The walls themselves are these chiseled,

5480
03:44:26.314 --> 03:44:30.989
refractory, opaque gray marble.

5481
03:44:32.376 --> 03:44:34.371
Heading down this hallway, more soldiers pass you,

5482
03:44:34.371 --> 03:44:35.871
they look curious and there's definitely

5483
03:44:35.871 --> 03:44:37.482
with each moment of recognition,

5484
03:44:37.482 --> 03:44:40.788
an impulse towards intruder

5485
03:44:40.788 --> 03:44:42.268
and then a moment of recognition

5486
03:44:42.268 --> 03:44:46.245
that goes into a moment of relaxation.

5487
03:44:46.245 --> 03:44:50.862
They lead you out to the exterior

5488
03:44:50.862 --> 03:44:53.333
in which you now look upon

5489
03:44:53.333 --> 03:44:56.623
the entirety of the beautiful city of Rosohna.

5490
03:44:56.623 --> 03:44:59.867
It is midnight here, from what you can tell,

5491
03:44:59.867 --> 03:45:02.864
a pitch-black sky, sparse with clouds.

5492
03:45:02.864 --> 03:45:06.404
You can see circle after circle of this city

5493
03:45:06.404 --> 03:45:07.803
sprawling out around you,

5494
03:45:07.803 --> 03:45:10.986
separated by boundary walls,

5495
03:45:10.986 --> 03:45:13.729
themselves made of a similar gray-like material

5496
03:45:13.729 --> 03:45:16.101
with numerous small green lanterns of light

5497
03:45:16.101 --> 03:45:17.517
that flicker and glow across,

5498
03:45:17.517 --> 03:45:21.684
marking the separations to each ring of this city.

5499
03:45:22.822 --> 03:45:25.471
It is strange, it is dark,

5500
03:45:25.471 --> 03:45:27.743
it is beautiful, and it's alien.

5501
03:45:27.743 --> 03:45:31.076
Nothing quite like anything you've seen.

5502
03:45:32.024 --> 03:45:34.125
MICA: I fight the urge to run off and explore

5503
03:45:34.125 --> 03:45:37.272
because adventure is like the greatest thing on earth.

5504
03:45:37.272 --> 03:45:39.110
I'm just kind of, first of all,

5505
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:40.996
getting over the stomachache of--

5506
03:45:40.996 --> 03:45:41.829
MATT: Still a little queasy.

5507
03:45:41.829 --> 03:45:42.782
MICA: Still a little queasy,

5508
03:45:42.782 --> 03:45:44.238
but I'm just spinning around in a circle,

5509
03:45:44.238 --> 03:45:47.646
like not sure where to go first, like a dog.

5510
03:45:47.646 --> 03:45:49.594
MATT: You guys see this push and pull.

5511
03:45:49.594 --> 03:45:52.566
TRAVIS: No, you'll be fine, there's time to explore later.

5512
03:45:52.566 --> 03:45:53.715
MICA: Do we? Can we?

5513
03:45:53.715 --> 03:45:54.548
TRAVIS: In a bit.

5514
03:45:54.548 --> 03:45:56.163
MICA: Okay.

5515
03:45:56.163 --> 03:45:57.629
LAURA: You should see our house!
MICA: You have a house?

5516
03:45:57.629 --> 03:45:59.132
LAURA: We have a tree on the roof!

5517
03:45:59.132 --> 03:45:59.965
MICA: What?
LAURA: Yeah.

5518
03:45:59.965 --> 03:46:00.798
MICA: Can we go?

5519
03:46:00.798 --> 03:46:03.912
TRAVIS: Less stimuli, why we are on an objective, yes.

5520
03:46:03.912 --> 03:46:05.916
MICA: Right, but...

5521
03:46:05.916 --> 03:46:08.005
LAURA: And a hot tub!
MICA: What?

5522
03:46:08.005 --> 03:46:09.671
LAURA: In our house!
MICA: What?

5523
03:46:09.671 --> 03:46:11.411
Can we go now?

5524
03:46:11.411 --> 03:46:13.303
No? They seem like no.

5525
03:46:13.303 --> 03:46:15.502
TRAVIS: We're going to see Essek, right?

5526
03:46:15.502 --> 03:46:16.335
MICA: Can we go?

5527
03:46:16.335 --> 03:46:17.877
MATT: What's the order of operations here?

5528
03:46:17.877 --> 03:46:19.085
LIAM: Well, we should speak to Essek,

5529
03:46:19.085 --> 03:46:20.585
I need to speak to Essek.

5530
03:46:20.585 --> 03:46:22.261
MARISHA: We should check in at the house anyway.

5531
03:46:22.261 --> 03:46:24.405
LAURA: We should show Essek the--

5532
03:46:24.405 --> 03:46:25.406
LIAM: Yeah, absolutely.

5533
03:46:25.406 --> 03:46:27.429
MARISHA: I should make sure Dairon's okay.

5534
03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:30.715
SAM: And that she's properly folded our laundry by now.

5535
03:46:30.715 --> 03:46:31.549
TALIESIN: Perhaps we should

5536
03:46:31.549 --> 03:46:33.149
tell Essek to meet us at the house

5537
03:46:33.149 --> 03:46:34.628
and that's where we should take care of things.

5538
03:46:34.628 --> 03:46:35.944
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

5539
03:46:35.944 --> 03:46:37.116
LAURA: Yeah.

5540
03:46:37.116 --> 03:46:37.949
Oh.

5541
03:46:38.861 --> 03:46:40.135
Yeah, I can do that.

5542
03:46:40.135 --> 03:46:43.862
Yes, I can do that, I have the pearl. I can do that.

5543
03:46:43.862 --> 03:46:47.018
I will send a message to Essek again.

5544
03:46:47.018 --> 03:46:48.310
MATT: All righty.

5545
03:46:48.310 --> 03:46:49.643
MICA: This poor guy.

5546
03:46:50.600 --> 03:46:51.433
TALIESIN: Hey.

5547
03:46:52.989 --> 03:46:55.794
LAURA: It's me again.
MICA: 'Sup, dude.

5548
03:46:55.794 --> 03:46:57.517
TALIESIN: Brah.
MICA: Brah.

5549
03:46:57.517 --> 03:47:01.240
LAURA: Don't worry, we made it totally safe,

5550
03:47:01.240 --> 03:47:03.112
we're back here,

5551
03:47:03.112 --> 03:47:07.973
just heading to the house if you want to meet us there.

5552
03:47:07.973 --> 03:47:10.890
We have something cool to show you.

5553
03:47:12.935 --> 03:47:14.999
We have a friend with us.

5554
03:47:14.999 --> 03:47:18.016
Don't be surprised.

5555
03:47:18.016 --> 03:47:20.024
See you soon.

5556
03:47:23.236 --> 03:47:25.162
Essek's response is,

5557
03:47:25.162 --> 03:47:27.495
"That is quicker than I was expecting.

5558
03:47:27.495 --> 03:47:28.596
"Well, then.

5559
03:47:28.596 --> 03:47:32.105
"I will be heading over towards your abode shortly.

5560
03:47:32.105 --> 03:47:34.388
"Get your things ready."

5561
03:47:34.388 --> 03:47:35.942
LAURA: Get our stuff ready, he's coming.

5562
03:47:35.942 --> 03:47:37.386
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.

5563
03:47:37.386 --> 03:47:38.219
MATT: Is there anything you guys need to do before

5564
03:47:38.219 --> 03:47:40.999
meeting up with Essek at your home?

5565
03:47:40.999 --> 03:47:43.846
LIAM: On the way there, I will probably try to

5566
03:47:43.846 --> 03:47:46.467
find a place where I can replenish my supply

5567
03:47:46.467 --> 03:47:48.541
of fancy chalks for--

5568
03:47:48.541 --> 03:47:50.784
MATT: You know of two locations you've been introduced to

5569
03:47:50.784 --> 03:47:53.556
by Essek in your brief excursion through the city,

5570
03:47:53.556 --> 03:47:54.397
getting a lay of the land

5571
03:47:54.397 --> 03:47:56.300
where this is accessible to you.

5572
03:47:56.300 --> 03:47:58.791
LIAM: Okay, so I'm dropping enough for four more times.

5573
03:47:58.791 --> 03:47:59.624
MATT: Go for it.

5574
03:47:59.624 --> 03:48:03.133
Mark those components down on your inventory.

5575
03:48:03.133 --> 03:48:05.405
TALIESIN: I'm repacking teas, spices,
things that we need for travel

5576
03:48:05.405 --> 03:48:07.201
and I'm going to try and take the flower off my head

5577
03:48:07.201 --> 03:48:09.045
and see if I can get it going in the tree

5578
03:48:09.045 --> 03:48:10.024
once we're back home.

5579
03:48:10.024 --> 03:48:11.091
LAURA: Ooh, yeah.

5580
03:48:11.091 --> 03:48:13.242
TALIESIN: Since we've got some stuff going there anyway.

5581
03:48:13.242 --> 03:48:15.842
MATT: You are brought towards this neighborhood.

5582
03:48:15.842 --> 03:48:18.943
The architecture is familiar, but distinctly different

5583
03:48:18.943 --> 03:48:22.604
and it's really beautiful,

5584
03:48:22.604 --> 03:48:26.988
also the populace here is vastly drow.

5585
03:48:30.804 --> 03:48:34.637
As well as you see bits of other creatures

5586
03:48:34.637 --> 03:48:37.814
you're not used to seeing in and around Uthodurn.

5587
03:48:37.814 --> 03:48:41.217
You do see some orcs and you had some interactions with

5588
03:48:41.217 --> 03:48:46.142
orcs of different ideals and dispositions,

5589
03:48:47.440 --> 03:48:51.798
from Boroftkrah to the south, very

5590
03:48:51.798 --> 03:48:54.135
positive if aloof

5591
03:48:54.135 --> 03:48:56.885
in their interactions and very--

5592
03:48:58.233 --> 03:49:02.122
Very culturally protective, but

5593
03:49:02.122 --> 03:49:04.966
agnostic to anything with Uthodurn specifically

5594
03:49:04.966 --> 03:49:06.742
as opposed to the Jez-Araz,

5595
03:49:06.742 --> 03:49:08.981
orcs which are much more intense

5596
03:49:08.981 --> 03:49:12.586
and hunt whatever comes their path.

5597
03:49:13.745 --> 03:49:16.428
You see occasionally goblins

5598
03:49:16.428 --> 03:49:21.276
and bugbears and other, you know,

5599
03:49:21.276 --> 03:49:25.634
people that you've heard varying degrees of

5600
03:49:25.634 --> 03:49:27.717
communication about being

5601
03:49:28.573 --> 03:49:31.962
considered enemies, villainous,

5602
03:49:31.962 --> 03:49:34.545
killers of dwarf and elf alike.

5603
03:49:36.694 --> 03:49:37.947
It's just a lot of conflicting information

5604
03:49:37.947 --> 03:49:40.852
in your head at once you're trying to get through,

5605
03:49:40.852 --> 03:49:42.746
and as you're struggling with that,

5606
03:49:42.746 --> 03:49:44.953
you're brought into this neighborhood and see a home.

5607
03:49:44.953 --> 03:49:47.010
A very nice two-story home

5608
03:49:47.010 --> 03:49:50.903
where upon a parapet-like tower in the far corner,

5609
03:49:50.903 --> 03:49:54.002
a massive fucking tree

5610
03:49:54.002 --> 03:49:58.454
is growing 60 or so feet out of the top of it,

5611
03:49:58.454 --> 03:50:01.406
covered in lights.

5612
03:50:01.406 --> 03:50:02.469
MICA: Is that the tree?

5613
03:50:02.469 --> 03:50:03.810
LAURA: That's it.

5614
03:50:03.810 --> 03:50:05.270
It's really pretty, right?

5615
03:50:05.270 --> 03:50:07.438
MICA: How did it get there?
SAM: He did it.

5616
03:50:07.438 --> 03:50:09.763
TALIESIN: Hey.
MICA: (gasps)

5617
03:50:09.763 --> 03:50:10.616
It's so nice!

5618
03:50:10.616 --> 03:50:12.685
TALIESIN: Thank you. Yeah, I'm pretty proud of that.

5619
03:50:12.685 --> 03:50:14.409
MICA: I love it!
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5620
03:50:14.409 --> 03:50:16.157
MICA: Does it have a name?

5621
03:50:16.157 --> 03:50:18.040
TALIESIN: You know, I haven't asked.

5622
03:50:18.040 --> 03:50:19.448
I should ask.
MICA: You should ask!

5623
03:50:19.448 --> 03:50:21.148
TALIESIN: It never occurs to me to ask plants' names,

5624
03:50:21.148 --> 03:50:22.391
normally it just doesn't come up.

5625
03:50:22.391 --> 03:50:24.605
I've actually never met a plant with a name.

5626
03:50:24.605 --> 03:50:26.354
Well, wait...

5627
03:50:26.354 --> 03:50:29.252
(laughter)

5628
03:50:29.252 --> 03:50:30.735
LAURA: Clay goes silent for an hour.

5629
03:50:30.735 --> 03:50:32.985
(laughter)

5630
03:50:33.903 --> 03:50:36.294
MATT: As you guys approach the entryway,

5631
03:50:36.294 --> 03:50:38.193
(laughter)

5632
03:50:38.193 --> 03:50:39.952
TALIESIN: Thank you.

5633
03:50:39.952 --> 03:50:44.952
MATT: The familiar face of Dairon's dark elf form goes,

5634
03:50:46.205 --> 03:50:47.538
"You've returned.

5635
03:50:48.897 --> 03:50:50.023
"Well, come inside.

5636
03:50:50.023 --> 03:50:52.356
"Tell me what has transpired."

5637
03:50:53.572 --> 03:50:56.439
And ushers you all in, looks over to you.

5638
03:50:56.439 --> 03:50:58.474
"And you are?"

5639
03:50:58.474 --> 03:51:00.195
MICA: I'm Reani.

5640
03:51:00.195 --> 03:51:01.028
MATT: "Reani."

5641
03:51:02.360 --> 03:51:04.853
MARISHA: She's cool.

5642
03:51:04.853 --> 03:51:06.462
MATT: "Dairon."

5643
03:51:06.462 --> 03:51:08.568
MICA: Kind of like, eying his hand.

5644
03:51:08.568 --> 03:51:09.651
MARISHA: She's cool.

5645
03:51:13.189 --> 03:51:17.022
Yeah, I actually like this though, this, yeah.

5646
03:51:18.543 --> 03:51:21.918
I mean, in terms of how

5647
03:51:21.918 --> 03:51:24.043
protective you all are.

5648
03:51:24.043 --> 03:51:26.087
Stop staring at me, Christ.

5649
03:51:26.087 --> 03:51:27.119
MATT: "Come inside."

5650
03:51:27.119 --> 03:51:29.078
LAURA: Who, what, who is that?

5651
03:51:29.078 --> 03:51:31.542
MARISHA: Sorry, I just mean, nevermind.

5652
03:51:31.542 --> 03:51:34.630
LAURA: Dairon, Essek is on his way over.

5653
03:51:34.630 --> 03:51:38.229
MATT: "I will do my best to be out of sight."

5654
03:51:38.229 --> 03:51:39.644
TALIESIN: No, I haven't.

5655
03:51:39.644 --> 03:51:41.894
(laughter)

5656
03:51:42.989 --> 03:51:44.809
MATT: In the meantime, as you're out shopping

5657
03:51:44.809 --> 03:51:46.591
and gathering everything and you guys are all at the house,

5658
03:51:46.591 --> 03:51:48.498
they give you the tour of the space,

5659
03:51:48.498 --> 03:51:50.161
beautiful interior, it's kept well.

5660
03:51:50.161 --> 03:51:55.161
Dairon's done decent maintenance, at the very least.

5661
03:51:55.583 --> 03:51:58.845
There is a tub of water at the base of the tower

5662
03:51:58.845 --> 03:51:59.983
where the tree is above

5663
03:51:59.983 --> 03:52:02.117
and you can see the roots that have dug down

5664
03:52:02.117 --> 03:52:03.562
through the rock and stone that are

5665
03:52:03.562 --> 03:52:04.395
just tickling

5666
03:52:04.395 --> 03:52:07.915
about five feet above the water's surface.

5667
03:52:07.915 --> 03:52:10.181
It's strange.
LAURA: Pretty cool?

5668
03:52:10.181 --> 03:52:11.122
MICA: I like it.

5669
03:52:11.122 --> 03:52:12.627
TALIESIN: Pretty proud, pretty proud.

5670
03:52:12.627 --> 03:52:13.932
MATT: Leads you up into the base of the tree,

5671
03:52:13.932 --> 03:52:15.490
the top of it, and you can see there's a garden

5672
03:52:15.490 --> 03:52:16.926
that has been established here

5673
03:52:16.926 --> 03:52:19.187
where there are little shrines with little symbols

5674
03:52:19.187 --> 03:52:21.912
placed amongst them, incomplete in full collection,

5675
03:52:21.912 --> 03:52:24.181
but partially in process there

5676
03:52:24.181 --> 03:52:28.569
and little, small packets of

5677
03:52:28.569 --> 03:52:32.084
plants that are in the process of growing,

5678
03:52:32.084 --> 03:52:36.477
though having a tougher time given the environment here.

5679
03:52:36.477 --> 03:52:37.743
MICA: Are these your plants?

5680
03:52:37.743 --> 03:52:38.818
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, they're their own,

5681
03:52:38.818 --> 03:52:40.499
but yeah, I help with them here.

5682
03:52:40.499 --> 03:52:41.948
MICA: Do you want help with them?

5683
03:52:41.948 --> 03:52:43.363
TALIESIN: Always, of course.

5684
03:52:43.363 --> 03:52:45.017
MICA: I want to go over to all of them

5685
03:52:45.017 --> 03:52:48.751
and just generally Druidcraft over them

5686
03:52:48.751 --> 03:52:51.333
and give them love and warmth and growing powers.

5687
03:52:51.333 --> 03:52:54.428
MATT: The way you've established this,

5688
03:52:54.428 --> 03:52:59.245
it's sustainable, but it doesn't allow for rapid--

5689
03:53:01.636 --> 03:53:03.728
what's the word I'm looking for--

5690
03:53:03.728 --> 03:53:06.906
rapid abundance, if you will,

5691
03:53:06.906 --> 03:53:09.402
or flourishing of these different pockets.

5692
03:53:09.402 --> 03:53:11.148
TRAVIS: -- expansion.

5693
03:53:11.148 --> 03:53:14.374
MATT: However, as Reani comes through,

5694
03:53:14.374 --> 03:53:18.872
having a different, but fascinating connection with nature

5695
03:53:18.872 --> 03:53:20.796
than the one that you have.

5696
03:53:20.796 --> 03:53:22.300
You watch as each of these patches,

5697
03:53:22.300 --> 03:53:24.700
suddenly the color becomes more vibrant.

5698
03:53:24.700 --> 03:53:28.431
The leaves, the flowers, everything seems to blossom

5699
03:53:28.431 --> 03:53:31.371
as she runs her hands across the exterior.

5700
03:53:31.371 --> 03:53:34.040
Not to an unfathomable degree,

5701
03:53:34.040 --> 03:53:38.991
but quickly and subtly, in a way that it impresses you.

5702
03:53:38.991 --> 03:53:40.248
LAURA: Wow.

5703
03:53:40.248 --> 03:53:42.295
TALIESIN: Ah, that's great.

5704
03:53:42.295 --> 03:53:43.128
This is--

5705
03:53:44.252 --> 03:53:46.548
Oh, that's great, I was getting a little worried on the--

5706
03:53:46.548 --> 03:53:48.380
MICA: You know, sometimes you just got to talk to them

5707
03:53:48.380 --> 03:53:50.971
in the right way and give them a little more encouragement.

5708
03:53:50.971 --> 03:53:52.446
TALIESIN: Well, I've been trying to encourage.

5709
03:53:52.446 --> 03:53:54.346
I mean, I talk to them as much as--

5710
03:53:54.346 --> 03:53:55.892
MICA: Yeah, I can tell, they like you.

5711
03:53:55.892 --> 03:53:57.347
TALIESIN: Oh, well I like them, too.

5712
03:53:57.347 --> 03:53:58.430
MICA: Yeah, good.

5713
03:53:59.499 --> 03:54:00.503
Well, I'm glad to be of service.

5714
03:54:00.503 --> 03:54:01.643
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

5715
03:54:01.643 --> 03:54:04.360
Thank you for reminding me by the way,

5716
03:54:04.360 --> 03:54:07.193
I meant to ask, what is your name?

5717
03:54:09.704 --> 03:54:10.543
I'm talking to the tree.

5718
03:54:10.543 --> 03:54:11.551
MATT: Yeah.

5719
03:54:11.551 --> 03:54:13.801
(laughter)

5720
03:54:16.822 --> 03:54:17.655
MICA: Is he responding?

5721
03:54:17.655 --> 03:54:18.488
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5722
03:54:18.488 --> 03:54:19.321
MICA: Yeah?

5723
03:54:19.321 --> 03:54:20.585
TALIESIN: Yeah, his name is Silence, apparently.

5724
03:54:20.585 --> 03:54:22.704
MICA: Oh, that's a good name, that's a good name.

5725
03:54:22.704 --> 03:54:23.537
Strong.

5726
03:54:23.537 --> 03:54:24.549
TALIESIN: There's just nothing, yeah.

5727
03:54:24.549 --> 03:54:25.898
It's just quiet, it's kind of nice.

5728
03:54:25.898 --> 03:54:26.731
LIAM: Sylas!

5729
03:54:26.731 --> 03:54:27.573
MICA: We can call him Sy.

5730
03:54:27.573 --> 03:54:28.548
TALIESIN: We can call him Sy.

5731
03:54:28.548 --> 03:54:30.314
MICA: I think he likes it.

5732
03:54:31.602 --> 03:54:32.818
TALIESIN: He just keeps saying his name.

5733
03:54:32.818 --> 03:54:33.738
It's pretty, I think.

5734
03:54:33.738 --> 03:54:35.988
(laughter)

5735
03:54:37.789 --> 03:54:38.789
MATT: All right.

5736
03:54:40.673 --> 03:54:42.027
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

5737
03:54:42.027 --> 03:54:43.728
MATT: You don't happen to have Speak with Plants prepared,

5738
03:54:43.728 --> 03:54:44.561
do you?

5739
03:54:44.561 --> 03:54:46.019
MICA: I don't, actually.

5740
03:54:46.019 --> 03:54:47.594
MATT: That would've been fun.
MICA: I'm so mad!

5741
03:54:47.594 --> 03:54:48.427
MATT: That's okay.

5742
03:54:48.427 --> 03:54:52.026
All right, so, around this time, Caleb returns,

5743
03:54:52.026 --> 03:54:53.240
gathering materials as well

5744
03:54:53.240 --> 03:54:56.797
including what Caduceus was requesting,

5745
03:54:56.797 --> 03:55:00.051
right about the time that Essek arrives.

5746
03:55:00.051 --> 03:55:03.433
Now, who you see arrived at the front,

5747
03:55:03.433 --> 03:55:07.150
a male drow, short white hair,

5748
03:55:08.391 --> 03:55:11.248
a perpetual soft smile,

5749
03:55:11.248 --> 03:55:13.012
a similar mantle of armor

5750
03:55:13.012 --> 03:55:15.426
to the soldiers that you saw exterior,

5751
03:55:15.426 --> 03:55:20.426
but beneath it, a cloak of dark purple

5752
03:55:20.833 --> 03:55:21.884
just drifts below

5753
03:55:21.884 --> 03:55:24.693
and obscures the entirety of his body.

5754
03:55:24.693 --> 03:55:26.830
As he glides in, no bobs or footsteps,

5755
03:55:26.830 --> 03:55:29.780
just drifting to the front of the house

5756
03:55:29.780 --> 03:55:33.585
and entering the chamber upon being met up with the rest.

5757
03:55:33.585 --> 03:55:36.409
"It is good to see all of you well.

5758
03:55:36.409 --> 03:55:40.664
"And this is the friend you were talking about?"

5759
03:55:40.664 --> 03:55:43.088
MICA: I lean over to Jester like:

5760
03:55:43.088 --> 03:55:44.017
He is hot.

5761
03:55:44.017 --> 03:55:44.850
LAURA: I know!

5762
03:55:46.147 --> 03:55:47.421
MICA: Wow.

5763
03:55:47.421 --> 03:55:50.963
MATT: "If I might inquire, what is your name?"

5764
03:55:50.963 --> 03:55:52.333
MICA: Just Reani.

5765
03:55:52.333 --> 03:55:53.986
(laughter)

5766
03:55:53.986 --> 03:55:54.819
MATT: "Well.

5767
03:55:56.415 --> 03:55:57.248
"Welcome.

5768
03:55:58.982 --> 03:56:00.482
"Where do you hail?"

5769
03:56:01.414 --> 03:56:02.520
MICA: Nicodranas.

5770
03:56:02.520 --> 03:56:03.688
SAM: What, um...

5771
03:56:03.688 --> 03:56:04.521
TRAVIS: Sorry.

5772
03:56:04.521 --> 03:56:08.198
I mean, you're speaking very quietly.

5773
03:56:08.198 --> 03:56:11.957
MICA: Um, I'm from Nicodranas.

5774
03:56:11.957 --> 03:56:13.246
MATT: "Hmm."

5775
03:56:13.246 --> 03:56:14.591
LAURA: Me, too!

5776
03:56:14.591 --> 03:56:15.424
MATT: "Indeed.

5777
03:56:16.515 --> 03:56:19.082
"So you required my assistance?

5778
03:56:19.082 --> 03:56:20.904
"My time is--"
SAM: Yes.

5779
03:56:20.904 --> 03:56:22.135
LAURA: Really valuable.

5780
03:56:22.135 --> 03:56:25.246
SAM: Remember how you teleported us somewhere?

5781
03:56:25.246 --> 03:56:27.404
MATT: "Yes, to the Greying Wildlands."

5782
03:56:27.404 --> 03:56:29.165
SAM: We need to go somewhere else.

5783
03:56:29.165 --> 03:56:30.138
MATT: "Whereabouts?"

5784
03:56:30.138 --> 03:56:32.471
LAURA: It's called Mythburrow.

5785
03:56:33.752 --> 03:56:34.585
MATT: "Very well."

5786
03:56:34.585 --> 03:56:36.502
LAURA: Have you heard of it?

5787
03:56:37.455 --> 03:56:38.908
SAM: Oh boy.

5788
03:56:38.908 --> 03:56:40.241
TRAVIS: We have a map.

5789
03:56:41.959 --> 03:56:42.792
MATT: "No."

5790
03:56:42.792 --> 03:56:43.784
(laughter)

5791
03:56:43.784 --> 03:56:45.889
LAURA: So we do have a map, but also I was thinking,

5792
03:56:45.889 --> 03:56:50.355
what if I scryed on the...

5793
03:56:50.355 --> 03:56:51.190
dragon?

5794
03:56:51.190 --> 03:56:52.033
SAM: Can you do that?

5795
03:56:52.033 --> 03:56:52.883
You're familiar--

5796
03:56:52.883 --> 03:56:54.174
LAURA: I'm familiar with it.

5797
03:56:54.174 --> 03:56:55.227
TRAVIS: We know his name.

5798
03:56:55.227 --> 03:56:58.727
LAURA: Yeah, and I know basically what he looks like.

5799
03:56:58.727 --> 03:57:00.676
SAM: Do dragons sense that sort of thing?

5800
03:57:00.676 --> 03:57:02.070
LAURA: Who knows, I don't.

5801
03:57:02.070 --> 03:57:03.174
SAM: All right, let's do it then.

5802
03:57:03.174 --> 03:57:04.063
TALIESIN: I mean, one would assume.

5803
03:57:04.063 --> 03:57:05.563
LIAM: No, that's rare.

5804
03:57:07.274 --> 03:57:08.786
MATT: So what are you doing?

5805
03:57:08.786 --> 03:57:10.487
LAURA: I'm going to try to scry on--

5806
03:57:10.487 --> 03:57:12.204
SAM: Do we need to do this?

5807
03:57:12.204 --> 03:57:13.941
We're doing this to get a location

5808
03:57:13.941 --> 03:57:15.792
so that we can teleport closest.

5809
03:57:15.792 --> 03:57:16.765
LAURA: Wouldn't it be better if

5810
03:57:16.765 --> 03:57:20.852
I could give you a description of what it looks like?

5811
03:57:20.852 --> 03:57:23.085
MATT: "That would probably be helpful to us

5812
03:57:23.085 --> 03:57:24.590
"to a minor extent.

5813
03:57:24.590 --> 03:57:25.990
"As I have not traveled there,

5814
03:57:25.990 --> 03:57:28.081
"it's going to be challenging, but not impossible."

5815
03:57:28.081 --> 03:57:30.525
TALIESIN: Perhaps also not attempting to

5816
03:57:30.525 --> 03:57:32.931
teleport directly on top of the dragon.

5817
03:57:32.931 --> 03:57:33.984
LAURA: Well, yeah, I know that.

5818
03:57:33.984 --> 03:57:35.590
TALIESIN: Like maybe a mile or two away.

5819
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:38.226
MATT: "So I'm just mildly curious.

5820
03:57:38.226 --> 03:57:39.781
"Dragon?"

5821
03:57:39.781 --> 03:57:40.857
TALIESIN: Oh well.

5822
03:57:40.857 --> 03:57:41.690
MARISHA: It's like a--

5823
03:57:41.690 --> 03:57:42.922
LAURA: Have you heard of--

5824
03:57:42.922 --> 03:57:44.264
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Gelidon?

5825
03:57:44.264 --> 03:57:46.881
LIAM: It's a story with many parts.

5826
03:57:46.881 --> 03:57:48.089
MARISHA: He's a piece of the puzzle

5827
03:57:48.089 --> 03:57:51.756
in us trying to accomplish our overall goal.

5828
03:57:52.923 --> 03:57:54.754
MATT: "All right, so you're going to a dragon."

5829
03:57:54.754 --> 03:57:55.587
LAURA: Yeah.

5830
03:57:56.912 --> 03:57:59.754
Have you heard of iceflex?

5831
03:58:03.751 --> 03:58:04.672
MATT: "No."

5832
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:07.676
LAURA: It's mithral that's been breathed on by a dragon,

5833
03:58:07.676 --> 03:58:09.364
a white dragon specifically.

5834
03:58:09.364 --> 03:58:12.092
We have to go there and get him to breathe on the mithral

5835
03:58:12.092 --> 03:58:14.507
so that we can go and get this sword fixed

5836
03:58:14.507 --> 03:58:17.389
so that we can defeat the Laughing Hand and you know,

5837
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:21.060
serve the Bright Queen like she wants us to.

5838
03:58:21.060 --> 03:58:22.485
TALIESIN: Pretty standard stuff, really.

5839
03:58:22.485 --> 03:58:23.449
MARISHA: Yeah.

5840
03:58:23.449 --> 03:58:24.866
MATT: "Quite standard."

5841
03:58:26.163 --> 03:58:30.330
LAURA: Here's the thing, can we sleep before we go?

5842
03:58:31.238 --> 03:58:33.186
TALIESIN: Well, I thought we would sleep once we're there.

5843
03:58:33.186 --> 03:58:34.019
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5844
03:58:34.019 --> 03:58:35.108
LAURA: Why, why would we do that

5845
03:58:35.108 --> 03:58:37.203
when we could sleep here instead?

5846
03:58:37.203 --> 03:58:40.236
TALIESIN: To get a better sense of where we are--

5847
03:58:40.236 --> 03:58:41.343
LAURA: What if something attacks us there

5848
03:58:41.343 --> 03:58:45.236
and we're not rested and we could be rested and go--

5849
03:58:45.236 --> 03:58:47.804
LIAM: Could we put a pin in that for just one moment?

5850
03:58:47.804 --> 03:58:50.134
May I ask, too, this is a separate topic--

5851
03:58:50.134 --> 03:58:50.967
MATT: "Yes."

5852
03:58:50.967 --> 03:58:55.496
LIAM: How is the timeline that we have discussed?

5853
03:58:55.496 --> 03:58:56.973
MATT: "(sighs)

5854
03:58:56.973 --> 03:59:01.723
"We are looking at an extension of maybe two more weeks,

5855
03:59:06.538 --> 03:59:08.947
"but I have pushed to the extent of my ability."

5856
03:59:08.947 --> 03:59:11.641
LIAM: Well, if we leave in the morning,

5857
03:59:11.641 --> 03:59:12.756
we have two weeks, that's good,

5858
03:59:12.756 --> 03:59:15.910
I have time, but perhaps tonight.

5859
03:59:15.910 --> 03:59:17.007
Now?

5860
03:59:17.007 --> 03:59:17.840
Today?

5861
03:59:19.023 --> 03:59:23.733
Would I be able to get in to see this prisoner again?

5862
03:59:23.733 --> 03:59:24.644
Or sometime--

5863
03:59:24.644 --> 03:59:27.811
MATT: "There needs to be a bit more of a--

5864
03:59:28.856 --> 03:59:31.004
"An acknowledgement in advance.

5865
03:59:31.004 --> 03:59:33.296
"Even I have my limitations within my den."

5866
03:59:33.296 --> 03:59:34.129
LIAM: Of course.

5867
03:59:34.129 --> 03:59:35.373
MATT: "And I've already pushed that to a limit

5868
03:59:35.373 --> 03:59:37.790
"to make good on your request.

5869
03:59:41.558 --> 03:59:44.283
"If you intend to leave, well, tomorrow,

5870
03:59:44.283 --> 03:59:46.706
"then I'm not entirely certain why you summon me now.

5871
03:59:46.706 --> 03:59:49.649
"If you intend to leave tonight,

5872
03:59:49.649 --> 03:59:52.654
"either way, you would need a few days

5873
03:59:52.654 --> 03:59:54.826
"for me to bring this to the den."

5874
03:59:54.826 --> 03:59:55.690
LIAM: Before we leave tonight,

5875
03:59:55.690 --> 03:59:58.811
if there's paperwork or logistics involved,

5876
03:59:58.811 --> 04:00:02.127
consider this my formal application, then.

5877
04:00:02.127 --> 04:00:04.037
MATT: "I will go ahead and put it in."

5878
04:00:04.037 --> 04:00:04.870
LIAM: Thank you.

5879
04:00:04.870 --> 04:00:05.717
MATT: Now--"

5880
04:00:05.717 --> 04:00:07.897
LAURA: Show him the thing.

5881
04:00:07.897 --> 04:00:09.847
LIAM: I feel like I'm pushing too much.

5882
04:00:09.847 --> 04:00:11.830
SAM: I'll ask him.
LAURA: But he might like it!

5883
04:00:11.830 --> 04:00:12.885
SAM: Yeah, there's one thing,

5884
04:00:12.885 --> 04:00:16.505
there's one thing. Caleb is such a polite young man,

5885
04:00:16.505 --> 04:00:18.687
he wouldn't bring this up to bother you with this,

5886
04:00:18.687 --> 04:00:22.844
but he found an amazing page filled with magic and wonder

5887
04:00:22.844 --> 04:00:27.044
and you might be the key that unlocks it.

5888
04:00:27.044 --> 04:00:31.280
LAURA: Also, I brought you a present.

5889
04:00:31.280 --> 04:00:32.730
MATT: "Yay."

5890
04:00:32.730 --> 04:00:34.647
LAURA: I pull out a cupcake.

5891
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:37.177
It's fresh, I swear!

5892
04:00:38.198 --> 04:00:39.038
MATT: Extends his hand

5893
04:00:39.038 --> 04:00:42.308
and the cupcake lifts out of your hand--

5894
04:00:42.308 --> 04:00:43.545
LAURA: I did that myself.
MATT: -- and drifts over.

5895
04:00:43.545 --> 04:00:44.730
LIAM: This guy's a germophobe.

5896
04:00:44.730 --> 04:00:46.555
(laughter)

5897
04:00:46.555 --> 04:00:47.704
SAM: That's why he floats.

5898
04:00:47.704 --> 04:00:48.537
TRAVIS: Thank you.

5899
04:00:50.195 --> 04:00:51.395
SAM: Like Howie Mandel?

5900
04:00:51.395 --> 04:00:52.339
MATT: "Thank you."

5901
04:00:52.339 --> 04:00:55.030
It vanishes beneath the cloak.

5902
04:00:55.030 --> 04:00:58.402
SAM: Oh, he eats with his sleeve!

5903
04:00:58.402 --> 04:01:00.137
(laughter)

5904
04:01:00.137 --> 04:01:02.607
MATT: Subtle chewing noises emerge from it.

5905
04:01:02.607 --> 04:01:04.857
(laughter)

5906
04:01:06.005 --> 04:01:08.305
It's like Bishamon from Darkstalkers, anyway.

5907
04:01:08.305 --> 04:01:10.674
LIAM: Sheepishly fishes this page out and says:

5908
04:01:10.674 --> 04:01:14.540
I've only just acquired this, but it stumping me a bit.

5909
04:01:14.540 --> 04:01:17.535
Does this mean anything to you?

5910
04:01:17.535 --> 04:01:20.452
MATT: Reaches out and takes the page.

5911
04:01:20.452 --> 04:01:22.035
Unfurls it.

5912
04:01:26.698 --> 04:01:28.496
(speaking foreign language)

5913
04:01:28.496 --> 04:01:30.933
Begins suddenly incanting some spell

5914
04:01:30.933 --> 04:01:34.063
and you begin to recognize it, hopefully.

5915
04:01:34.063 --> 04:01:35.667
Make an arcana check.

5916
04:01:35.667 --> 04:01:36.565
LIAM: What he's casting?

5917
04:01:36.565 --> 04:01:37.952
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5918
04:01:37.952 --> 04:01:39.869
LIAM: Yeah sure, that's 26.

5919
04:01:40.927 --> 04:01:42.023
MATT: Dispel Magic.

5920
04:01:42.023 --> 04:01:43.245
LAURA: Oh, well.

5921
04:01:43.245 --> 04:01:44.384
LIAM: I was going to do that tonight at bedtime.

5922
04:01:44.384 --> 04:01:45.225
Great.

5923
04:01:45.225 --> 04:01:47.485
MATT: He completes the cast.

5924
04:01:47.485 --> 04:01:52.485
You watch as suddenly all the writing on the page flares,

5925
04:01:52.793 --> 04:01:54.991
you hear a tearing sound,

5926
04:01:54.991 --> 04:01:57.475
and it seems like dropping out of the bottom of the page,

5927
04:01:57.475 --> 04:01:59.241
(whooshing)

5928
04:01:59.241 --> 04:02:02.654
two pouches and a round case

5929
04:02:02.654 --> 04:02:04.687
(rumbling) onto the ground.

5930
04:02:04.687 --> 04:02:05.761
MARISHA: Oh my god.

5931
04:02:05.761 --> 04:02:08.761
MATT: He goes, "I think I figured it out."

5932
04:02:10.831 --> 04:02:14.581
LIAM: Sometimes the simplest solutions escape us.

5933
04:02:16.061 --> 04:02:18.018
I'm in your debt again.

5934
04:02:18.018 --> 04:02:19.268
MATT: "Mm-hmm."
LIAM: Thank you.

5935
04:02:22.385 --> 04:02:23.609
SAM: Cool!
LIAM: Yeah,

5936
04:02:23.609 --> 04:02:28.536
I scoop up the things and hide them away for now.

5937
04:02:28.536 --> 04:02:29.936
SAM: Shall we away then?

5938
04:02:29.936 --> 04:02:31.316
MARISHA: Can I check in with Dairon real quick

5939
04:02:31.316 --> 04:02:32.306
while that was happening?

5940
04:02:32.306 --> 04:02:33.480
MATT: Sure, while this is happening,

5941
04:02:33.480 --> 04:02:35.926
Dairon is off in the other room, arms crossed.

5942
04:02:35.926 --> 04:02:37.929
She's listening in,

5943
04:02:37.929 --> 04:02:39.675
facing away from everything.

5944
04:02:39.675 --> 04:02:43.458
I just back up and lean against her.

5945
04:02:43.458 --> 04:02:46.139
MATT: "How goes everything, Beauregard?"

5946
04:02:46.139 --> 04:02:48.621
MARISHA: It's going pretty good.

5947
04:02:48.621 --> 04:02:50.903
About to head off to some sort of cursed land

5948
04:02:50.903 --> 04:02:55.438
to apparently have a white dragon breathe on a sword.

5949
04:02:55.438 --> 04:02:57.438
How's it going with you?

5950
04:02:58.483 --> 04:03:00.994
MATT: "I'm going to be perfectly honest.

5951
04:03:00.994 --> 04:03:02.244
"I hate it here.

5952
04:03:03.425 --> 04:03:05.925
"I'm not made for housekeeping."

5953
04:03:07.118 --> 04:03:10.436
MARISHA: The housekeeping was a guise.

5954
04:03:10.436 --> 04:03:12.028
MATT: "I know.

5955
04:03:12.028 --> 04:03:13.668
"What am I to do with my time

5956
04:03:13.668 --> 04:03:15.114
"when I have to maintain this guise

5957
04:03:15.114 --> 04:03:17.864
"when people occasionally come by?

5958
04:03:19.555 --> 04:03:20.726
"It's okay.

5959
04:03:20.726 --> 04:03:23.282
"I'm doing my own bits of detective work in the meantime.

5960
04:03:23.282 --> 04:03:25.365
"Just broken with dusting."

5961
04:03:28.847 --> 04:03:32.295
MARISHA: Well, the house looks fucking' fantastic.

5962
04:03:32.295 --> 04:03:33.295
MATT: "Thank you."

5963
04:03:35.737 --> 04:03:37.197
MARISHA: We'll talk more when we get back.

5964
04:03:37.197 --> 04:03:39.512
MATT: "I'm sure we will.

5965
04:03:39.512 --> 04:03:40.595
"White dragon?"

5966
04:03:41.890 --> 04:03:42.723
MARISHA: Yeah.

5967
04:03:42.723 --> 04:03:43.949
MATT: "How old?"

5968
04:03:43.949 --> 04:03:48.575
MARISHA: I don't know, at least 250 years old,
probably more.

5969
04:03:48.575 --> 04:03:52.716
How old is that, what's that mean, you have any information?

5970
04:03:52.716 --> 04:03:54.209
MATT: "It can depend.

5971
04:03:54.209 --> 04:03:58.627
"If it's 250 years old, it could be an adult."

5972
04:03:58.627 --> 04:03:59.460
MARISHA: Hm.

5973
04:03:59.460 --> 04:04:02.809
MATT: "Older, even bigger.

5974
04:04:02.809 --> 04:04:04.773
"You're all very talented people,

5975
04:04:04.773 --> 04:04:06.944
"but you have your limits.

5976
04:04:06.944 --> 04:04:09.104
"Just be careful.

5977
04:04:09.104 --> 04:04:12.495
"If things go poorly,

5978
04:04:12.495 --> 04:04:14.211
run."

5979
04:04:16.919 --> 04:04:17.919
MARISHA: All right.

5980
04:04:19.431 --> 04:04:21.647
MATT: "I say this

5981
04:04:21.647 --> 04:04:23.955
"as an individual who has survived this long

5982
04:04:23.955 --> 04:04:26.201
"because I knew when to run."

5983
04:04:27.097 --> 04:04:29.143
MARISHA: I can't abandon these people.

5984
04:04:29.143 --> 04:04:30.774
MATT: "No.

5985
04:04:30.774 --> 04:04:33.816
"So make them run with you.

5986
04:04:35.313 --> 04:04:38.129
"Bravery has a very fine line

5987
04:04:38.129 --> 04:04:41.012
before it turns into stupidity.

5988
04:04:41.966 --> 04:04:43.624
"Survive."

5989
04:04:44.742 --> 04:04:46.673
MARISHA: So you keep telling me.

5990
04:04:46.673 --> 04:04:48.699
MATT: "Indeed, and you have made it this far,

5991
04:04:48.699 --> 04:04:51.116
"that means you are listening."

5992
04:04:53.056 --> 04:04:55.204
MARISHA: Catch you on the flip.

5993
04:04:55.204 --> 04:04:56.695
Peace!

5994
04:04:58.051 --> 04:05:03.051
MATT: (heavy sigh) You hear a heavy sigh from Dairon.

5995
04:05:04.678 --> 04:05:06.261
You all join Essek,

5996
04:05:07.199 --> 04:05:09.169
gather in a circle,

5997
04:05:09.169 --> 04:05:12.432
he begins to mutter an incantation,

5998
04:05:12.432 --> 04:05:15.006
his voice begins to echo loudly

5999
04:05:15.006 --> 04:05:17.394
until it seems to consume the space around you

6000
04:05:17.394 --> 04:05:20.403
and in a similar, uncomfortable sensation,

6001
04:05:20.403 --> 04:05:23.707
all the color and shape suddenly blurs.

6002
04:05:23.707 --> 04:05:25.293
(whooshing)

6003
04:05:25.293 --> 04:05:27.370
I need someone to go ahead and roll--

6004
04:05:27.370 --> 04:05:28.656
SAM: Oh yeah.

6005
04:05:28.656 --> 04:05:31.314
MATT: A percentage dice for me, please.

6006
04:05:31.314 --> 04:05:32.388
LIAM: Got it.
MARISHA: Are you doing it?

6007
04:05:32.388 --> 04:05:33.701
LIAM: I'm doing it.
TALIESIN: All right.

6008
04:05:33.701 --> 04:05:38.318
MARISHA: Doing it on the map cam?

6009
04:05:38.318 --> 04:05:39.151
Nope.

6010
04:05:39.151 --> 04:05:41.384
LIAM: 87.

6011
04:05:41.384 --> 04:05:43.063
SAM: Ooh, that's good, that's good. I think?

6012
04:05:43.063 --> 04:05:44.688
Or is that bad?
LAURA: I don't know.

6013
04:05:44.688 --> 04:05:46.112
MATT: Hold on, I'm pulling up, I'm pulling it up right now.

6014
04:05:46.112 --> 04:05:47.245
TALIESIN: This is not an exact science.

6015
04:05:47.245 --> 04:05:48.895
MICA: Okay.
SAM: We might die.

6016
04:05:48.895 --> 04:05:49.728
MATT: 87, you said.
LAURA: You could be bamfed

6017
04:05:49.728 --> 04:05:51.241
into a rock.

6018
04:05:51.241 --> 04:05:53.375
MICA: Oh fuck!

6019
04:05:53.375 --> 04:05:55.306
TALIESIN: A lot can happen.
LIAM: Three miles in the air.

6020
04:05:55.306 --> 04:05:56.477
MATT: Let me pull it out of the book here,

6021
04:05:56.477 --> 04:05:58.559
it's a little convoluted in that, so,

6022
04:05:58.559 --> 04:06:02.465
keep the number in mind, thank you for your patience here.

6023
04:06:02.465 --> 04:06:03.622
TALIESIN: We're on the moon!

6024
04:06:03.622 --> 04:06:05.597
(cheering)

6025
04:06:05.597 --> 04:06:08.057
Wait. (gasping)

6026
04:06:08.057 --> 04:06:09.072
MICA: It's made of cheese!

6027
04:06:09.072 --> 04:06:10.207
MATT: Moonweaver ain't going to help you there.

6028
04:06:10.207 --> 04:06:11.575
TALIESIN: Whitestone was right!

6029
04:06:11.575 --> 04:06:12.408
And then I die.

6030
04:06:12.408 --> 04:06:15.045
(laughter)

6031
04:06:15.045 --> 04:06:16.622
MATT: All right, so what'd you roll?

6032
04:06:16.622 --> 04:06:18.188
LIAM: 87.

6033
04:06:18.188 --> 04:06:19.588
MATT: 87.

6034
04:06:20.569 --> 04:06:21.821
TALIESIN: Don't do that!

6035
04:06:21.821 --> 04:06:23.296
That's so mean!

6036
04:06:24.824 --> 04:06:27.075
MATT: With that sudden rush,

6037
04:06:27.075 --> 04:06:28.901
TALIESIN: Fuck.

6038
04:06:28.901 --> 04:06:33.182
MATT: The temperature immediately shifts

6039
04:06:33.182 --> 04:06:36.841
as you find yourselves suddenly sitting

6040
04:06:36.841 --> 04:06:40.822
in the center of a mild snowstorm.

6041
04:06:40.822 --> 04:06:43.511
Familiar to your first arrival here

6042
04:06:43.511 --> 04:06:45.635
in the Greying Wildlands.

6043
04:06:45.635 --> 04:06:47.062
A successful teleport

6044
04:06:47.062 --> 04:06:48.558
(sighing)

6045
04:06:48.558 --> 04:06:50.912
has brought you to the base

6046
04:06:50.912 --> 04:06:53.195
of a heavy mountain range

6047
04:06:53.195 --> 04:06:58.153
just beyond the white blasting of the snow around you.

6048
04:06:59.221 --> 04:07:01.234
You can see the rolling, craggy alps

6049
04:07:01.234 --> 04:07:03.805
just begin to vanish into the storm ahead,

6050
04:07:03.805 --> 04:07:06.771
this region still powdered familiar white

6051
04:07:06.771 --> 04:07:09.019
from the recent and current snowfall

6052
04:07:09.019 --> 04:07:12.744
but one mountainside's mild discoloration before you

6053
04:07:12.744 --> 04:07:14.356
catches your eye.

6054
04:07:14.356 --> 04:07:16.533
A few hundred feet up from its base,

6055
04:07:16.533 --> 04:07:21.533
a faceted, jagged, unnatural frostscape of white-blue ice

6056
04:07:21.591 --> 04:07:24.785
appears to have claimed the rocky incline

6057
04:07:24.785 --> 04:07:27.011
for a few hundred feet more,

6058
04:07:27.011 --> 04:07:28.444
looking like a plague of ice vines

6059
04:07:28.444 --> 04:07:30.824
erupting from the mountain's belly,

6060
04:07:30.824 --> 04:07:32.675
frozen in time after climbing

6061
04:07:32.675 --> 04:07:36.230
and attempting to burst out of the mountain itself.

6062
04:07:36.230 --> 04:07:41.230
In the center of that spiraling web of ice,

6063
04:07:41.397 --> 04:07:44.214
you see a massive cluster

6064
04:07:44.214 --> 04:07:46.181
of cage-like ice growths

6065
04:07:46.181 --> 04:07:49.914
that encircle an oblong mouth.

6066
04:07:51.213 --> 04:07:55.472
A cavern that enters the mountainside.

6067
04:07:57.193 --> 04:08:00.518
This, you assume is Mythburrow.

6068
04:08:03.029 --> 04:08:07.446
Essek turns to you all, his hair blowing in the wind,

6069
04:08:08.614 --> 04:08:10.392
"You're crazy,

6070
04:08:10.392 --> 04:08:12.917
"but good luck."

6071
04:08:12.917 --> 04:08:14.050
And that's where we'll pick up next week.

6072
04:08:14.050 --> 04:08:16.060
(sighing)

6073
04:08:16.060 --> 04:08:17.819
SAM: Oh man.
TRAVIS: Shit.

6074
04:08:17.819 --> 04:08:19.112
MATT: So you'll be joining us again for next week.

6075
04:08:19.112 --> 04:08:21.618
MICA: Yay!
(clapping)

6076
04:08:21.618 --> 04:08:23.250
Or you're like, "And this is where you die,

6077
04:08:23.250 --> 04:08:24.112
"goodbye, get out."

6078
04:08:24.112 --> 04:08:25.925
MATT: Also viable, also viable.

6079
04:08:25.925 --> 04:08:26.851
TRAVIS: Also possible.

6080
04:08:26.851 --> 04:08:29.735
MATT: You skipped a shit ton of possible encounters there.

6081
04:08:29.735 --> 04:08:30.568
MICA: What?

6082
04:08:30.568 --> 04:08:32.389
MATT: Well, yeah, because--
TRAVIS: We're not traveling by goat?

6083
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:33.222
MATT: You're not traveling by goat.

6084
04:08:33.222 --> 04:08:34.055
MICA: Oh.

6085
04:08:34.055 --> 04:08:36.047
MATT: Which is great, you guys did all that.

6086
04:08:36.047 --> 04:08:37.754
Earned some more in Essek's debt by doing so,

6087
04:08:37.754 --> 04:08:41.777
but you managed to avoid a lot of possible dangers

6088
04:08:41.777 --> 04:08:42.677
so well done.

6089
04:08:42.677 --> 04:08:43.897
TRAVIS: Damn it.

6090
04:08:43.897 --> 04:08:45.188
MARISHA: Did he say more Essek debt?

6091
04:08:45.188 --> 04:08:46.238
MATT: That's cool.
TRAVIS: What dangers?

6092
04:08:46.238 --> 04:08:47.143
MATT: I'll show you some of the maps afterwards,

6093
04:08:47.143 --> 04:08:48.164
because I was damn proud of them.

6094
04:08:48.164 --> 04:08:48.997
ALL: Aww.

6095
04:08:50.016 --> 04:08:51.281
MATT: Oh, don't apologize, this is my game, guys,

6096
04:08:51.281 --> 04:08:52.686
that's what I do.
TALIESIN: They come back.

6097
04:08:52.686 --> 04:08:53.754
MATT: It's what I do.

6098
04:08:53.754 --> 04:08:54.988
Anyway.

6099
04:08:54.988 --> 04:08:56.117
Thank you guys so much for joining us,

6100
04:08:56.117 --> 04:08:58.598
we'll be back at the Mythburrow

6101
04:08:58.598 --> 04:09:01.153
next Thursday to see where this leads them

6102
04:09:01.153 --> 04:09:03.365
on this leg of their journey.

6103
04:09:03.365 --> 04:09:05.685
Don't forget, we love you very much,

6104
04:09:05.685 --> 04:09:07.832
and is it Thursday yet?

6105
04:09:07.832 --> 04:09:08.682
Good night!

6106
04:09:08.682 --> 04:09:11.182
[epic music]

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.730
MATT: Hello, everyone. Welcome to Critical Role,

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.001
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.906
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.869
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.317
(laughter)

6
00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:13.117
MATT: We have our fantastic Laura Bailey

7
00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:14.783
and Travis Willingham via Skype

8
00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:16.360
in from San Diego Comic-Con at the moment.

9
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.160
Glad you guys could rush to your hotel room

10
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.339
in time to make this happen.

11
00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.799
LAURA: Yes, we did it.
TRAVIS: Hi, friends.

12
00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:23.896
(laughing)

13
00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:25.600
MATT: So, let's go ahead and get through

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.503
our announcements real fast so we can

15
00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:28.798
jump into tonight's game.

16
00:00:28.798 --> 00:00:30.233
I'm hoping for real fast, Sam.

17
00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.264
(laughter)

18
00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:33.424
As fast as we can.

19
00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:35.496
SAM: Real fast.
MATT: All right.

20
00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:38.001
First, we do have our fantastic sponsor,

21
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.522
returning from the beginning of the campaign

22
00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:43.268
on until now, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

23
00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:44.384
Sam.

24
00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:46.944
SAM: Guys, our sponsor's D&amp;D Beyond, and this week,

25
00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:49.479
they wanted you to know that our D&amp;D Beyond

26
00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:54.479
presidential campaign is coming to an end, next week.

27
00:00:55.158 --> 00:01:00.113
We are opening the polls for you to vote next Thursday.

28
00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:03.024
Starting next Thursday, July 25th, you can cast your vote

29
00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:07.850
for either me or Liam through the D&amp;D Beyond website.

30
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.946
There's information somewhere on your screen now.

31
00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:12.852
Polls will stay open until our Indianapolis live show

32
00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:15.850
during intermission on Friday, August 2nd.

33
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.498
When you vote, and you can vote,

34
00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:21.189
you'll be gifted some cool digital surprises

35
00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.109
from D&amp;D Beyond.
MARISHA: Ooh!

36
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.620
Keep an eye on the Critical Role and D&amp;D Beyond socials

37
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.325
next Thursday for that voting link.

38
00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:32.051
And to celebrate the end of the campaign,

39
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:33.476
we've got a special treat.

40
00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:36.035
As you know, a few weeks ago I challenged Liam O'Brien

41
00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:40.899
to vigorously master debate while you all watched.

42
00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.385
And tonight it is on, so lube yourself up,

43
00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:46.605
dim the lights, and grab some tissue paper,

44
00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:50.211
because it's time to watch me and Liam master debate.

45
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:51.048
MARISHA: Don't dim the lights.

46
00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:55.948
(upbeat music)

47
00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:26.166
DANI: Welcome to the first-ever D&amp;D Beyond master debate.

48
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:29.457
Candidates Riegel and O'Brien will simultaneously

49
00:02:29.457 --> 00:02:32.735
master debate until they are raw and chafed,

50
00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:36.593
climaxing this spunky presidential race.

51
00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:38.411
(snickering)

52
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:39.586
DANI: Can't believe I agreed to do this

53
00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:41.352
before reading the script.

54
00:02:41.352 --> 00:02:44.637
As a palate cleanser, let me introduce our moderator,

55
00:02:44.637 --> 00:02:49.637
the brilliant, the adorable, the impartial Ronin Willingham.

56
00:02:49.856 --> 00:02:54.781
RONIN: (humming and baby sounds)

57
00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:02.981
ALL: Aww.

58
00:03:04.263 --> 00:03:06.855
DANI: After Ronin's questions, each candidate will have

59
00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:11.634
20 seconds to respond, and no, just because I am

60
00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:14.006
Sam's campaign manager, I will definitely not

61
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:16.585
be showing him any favoritism.

62
00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:17.779
SAM: (laughs)

63
00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:18.884
DANI: First question.

64
00:03:18.884 --> 00:03:19.717
Ronin?

65
00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:21.967
RONIN: (babbling)

66
00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:30.363
(laughter)

67
00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:31.946
DANI: Liam, you're first.

68
00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:35.569
LIAM: Thank you, Ronin, and a heartfelt thanks

69
00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.961
to all my supporters as well.

70
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:40.102
Now naturally, my first act as president

71
00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:43.008
will be to oversee the ongoing balance of the app,

72
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:46.442
ensuring the game can be played with maximum efficiency,

73
00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:50.000
precision, and, I guess, fun, if you're

74
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.502
into that kind of thing.

75
00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:53.335
I also plan to--

76
00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:54.176
(bell ringing)

77
00:03:54.176 --> 00:03:55.218
SAM: Oh, that's your time.

78
00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:56.801
Sorry.

79
00:03:57.684 --> 00:04:01.322
My response: blah blah blah, listen to this guy.

80
00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:04.397
Listen, my fellow Samericans, while my opponent

81
00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:07.148
is a stick-in-the-mud, fuddy-duddy rule abider,

82
00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:10.515
I've embraced heart of D&amp;D, so as your president,

83
00:04:10.515 --> 00:04:14.991
I'm going to make the D&amp;D Beyond app cool "AF".

84
00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:18.512
High key, I'll add some sick skateboards,

85
00:04:18.512 --> 00:04:22.082
electric guitars, hover boards. It's going to be woke.

86
00:04:22.082 --> 00:04:24.897
Hundo-P! Extra! Is my time done?

87
00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:25.976
DANI: Nope, 18 more seconds.

88
00:04:25.976 --> 00:04:27.059
SAM: Great. Slay!

89
00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.092
I just want to say I love all you Critters out there,

90
00:04:30.092 --> 00:04:33.289
and when I win, you can expect more of my radical ads,

91
00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.906
and I don't know, some free candy or something.

92
00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:36.948
How am I doing on time?

93
00:04:36.948 --> 00:04:37.993
DANI: 17 seconds left.

94
00:04:37.993 --> 00:04:38.876
SAM: Great.

95
00:04:38.876 --> 00:04:40.483
LIAM: He's been talking longer than 20 seconds!

96
00:04:40.483 --> 00:04:41.874
DANI: You are not Caleb, Liam.

97
00:04:41.874 --> 00:04:43.503
You don't always know what time it is.

98
00:04:43.503 --> 00:04:44.616
LIAM: Slander.

99
00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:46.027
DANI: Ronin, next question.

100
00:04:46.868 --> 00:04:49.118
RONIN: (babbling)

101
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.333
(laughter)

102
00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:04.543
SAM: Thank you, Ronin, for that excellent question.

103
00:05:04.543 --> 00:05:08.085
How would I lead the employees of D&amp;D Beyond?

104
00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:09.916
Well, real leaders have to set the tone

105
00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:12.252
for their employees and subordinates.

106
00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:15.740
So I'll cruise into work at 10:30, 11 most days,

107
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.860
and I'll give my employees cool nicknames,

108
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.881
like Slick Rick in Accounting,

109
00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:22.359
and HR Puff 'n Stuff in HR,

110
00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:25.417
and I'll call the mail room guys Chief, because that's cool.

111
00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:27.986
(laughter)

112
00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:32.874
LIAM: I will be firm, but fair.

113
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.511
I promise to keep this body focused

114
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:37.676
on the time-honored traditions of this great game,

115
00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:41.431
and inspire my employees to strive for honor

116
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:43.273
and excellence in their work.

117
00:05:43.273 --> 00:05:47.225
The tenets of Gygax will be hoisted to dizzying new heights.

118
00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:49.166
SAM: Can I do a quick rebuttal?

119
00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:50.660
Yawn.

120
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.599
LIAM: Rebuttal to your rebuttal, I will destroy you, Riegel!

121
00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.058
Destroy you!

122
00:05:55.058 --> 00:05:57.165
SAM: Bring it on, O'Boring!

123
00:05:57.165 --> 00:05:58.579
LIAM: You know what, why don't you just go write

124
00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:00.576
50 more comedy bits about your own anus?

125
00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:02.360
You Elon Musk clone!

126
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.611
(bell ringing)
DANI: Gentlemen, gentlemen,

127
00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:06.008
there are babies in this skit.

128
00:06:06.008 --> 00:06:07.996
Please be respectful.

129
00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:09.117
LIAM: Sorry.

130
00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:10.428
SAM: Sorry.

131
00:06:10.428 --> 00:06:11.768
It's our fault.

132
00:06:11.768 --> 00:06:14.519
DANI: Ronin, your final question, please.

133
00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:17.269
RONIN: (screams)

134
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.625
(laughter)

135
00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:29.680
TRAVIS: Good question.

136
00:06:30.931 --> 00:06:35.709
LIAM: Well, he has charm, obviously.

137
00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:37.809
But this campaign has changed him.

138
00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:40.211
He's become something I do not recognize.

139
00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:43.274
Driven by ambition, fueled by ego,

140
00:06:43.274 --> 00:06:45.619
but like, more than before.

141
00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:49.424
I just, I wish that no matter who wins,

142
00:06:49.424 --> 00:06:51.443
we can someday return to being

143
00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:54.227
the true friends that we once were.

144
00:06:55.552 --> 00:06:59.273
Deep down you are still my number one, Sam Riegel.

145
00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:00.902
SAM: Wow.

146
00:07:00.902 --> 00:07:02.485
Liam, I am stunned.

147
00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:06.958
I had no idea that you were just going to

148
00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.296
waste your last answer like that.

149
00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:11.223
A nice thing about O'Brainiac?

150
00:07:11.223 --> 00:07:14.207
No, I got nothing nice to say about this turd burglar.

151
00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.884
Vax couldn't make it through Vox Machina campaign,

152
00:07:16.884 --> 00:07:19.527
and Liam isn't going to survive this one.

153
00:07:19.527 --> 00:07:24.527
Riegel for President 2019. Prosecution rests. Boo yah!

154
00:07:24.904 --> 00:07:26.048
That's it.

155
00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:26.881
TRAVIS: Fire!

156
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:28.763
DANI: Well, that is all the time we have.

157
00:07:28.763 --> 00:07:32.331
Thanks for joining us for this public master debating.

158
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:35.256
Please forget this ever happened, please.

159
00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:37.751
SAM: And that's the debate, guys!

160
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:39.365
MATT: Thanks.

161
00:07:39.365 --> 00:07:41.699
(stilted clapping)

162
00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:42.790
MATT: Awesome.

163
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.754
Well done.

164
00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:46.801
(laughter)

165
00:07:46.801 --> 00:07:47.701
LAURA: Damn.

166
00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:48.534
MATT: Great.

167
00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:49.432
LAURA: It's not what I expected.

168
00:07:49.432 --> 00:07:50.425
MATT: D&amp;D Beyond--

169
00:07:50.425 --> 00:07:52.737
(laughter)

170
00:07:52.737 --> 00:07:54.832
MATT: --a fantastic tool, for those of you

171
00:07:54.832 --> 00:07:57.349
who play (laughing) Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

172
00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:59.986
Thank you for (laughing) sponsoring us.

173
00:07:59.986 --> 00:08:02.268
(laughter)

174
00:08:02.268 --> 00:08:04.227
SAM: Matt's reactions to all these

175
00:08:04.227 --> 00:08:06.932
are way better than the bits.

176
00:08:06.932 --> 00:08:11.442
MATT: Thank you for giving us Ronin on loan temporarily,

177
00:08:11.442 --> 00:08:12.722
Laura and Travis. That was great.

178
00:08:12.722 --> 00:08:13.799
LIAM: Thanks for trotting him out.

179
00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:16.201
MARISHA: God.
TALIESIN: Change the oil.

180
00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:18.403
MATT: All righty, so.

181
00:08:18.403 --> 00:08:21.241
Finish up the rest of these announcements real fast.

182
00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:24.413
As a reminder, we are headed down to San Diego Comic-Con

183
00:08:24.413 --> 00:08:29.412
to join these fuckers here for our Saturday panel.

184
00:08:29.412 --> 00:08:32.144
It's going to be at 4PM this Saturday, Pacific,

185
00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:36.511
at San Diego Comic-Con in room 6BCF.

186
00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:37.733
If you're going to be down there,

187
00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:40.383
please come see us, stay for the panel,

188
00:08:40.383 --> 00:08:43.141
crazy questions, and general D&amp;D chaos.

189
00:08:43.141 --> 00:08:45.132
Looking forward to seeing you guys there.

190
00:08:45.132 --> 00:08:47.662
It will be available on YouTube, however,

191
00:08:47.662 --> 00:08:49.727
next Thursday morning, so if you aren't there for it,

192
00:08:49.727 --> 00:08:51.333
it'll still be available for you to watch

193
00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:53.934
a little bit down the road.

194
00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:57.010
Also, as a note, our Mighty Nein and Vox Machina

195
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.387
miniatures box sets are made by our friends

196
00:09:00.387 --> 00:09:02.498
at Steamforged that you saw we Kickstarted last week

197
00:09:02.498 --> 00:09:03.722
with the help of you guys.

198
00:09:03.722 --> 00:09:05.168
A lot of those have gone out to everyone

199
00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:06.163
who helped us support the campaign.

200
00:09:06.163 --> 00:09:07.371
For those who weren't around for it

201
00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:08.545
or didn't have the opportunity then,

202
00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:10.725
they will be available for pre-order,

203
00:09:10.725 --> 00:09:12.786
or <i>are</i> available <i>now</i> for pre-order, actually,

204
00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:14.817
in both the US and the UK shops.

205
00:09:14.817 --> 00:09:17.780
They end on August 6th, and will ship out

206
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.021
at the end of the month, so go ahead and check it out.

207
00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:23.146
As a reminder, our mini sets will be available

208
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:25.424
in our favorite local game shops, too, so please be sure

209
00:09:25.424 --> 00:09:27.053
to support your local game shops

210
00:09:27.053 --> 00:09:29.800
and local businesses whenever you can.

211
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.800
Yeah, look in our shop at shop.critrole.com, I think it is?

212
00:09:35.049 --> 00:09:36.115
.co.uk?

213
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.976
Go to the shop part of the website and you'll figure it out.

214
00:09:40.934 --> 00:09:43.894
I believe that's the last of our announcements.

215
00:09:45.144 --> 00:09:46.870
Without further ado, let's go ahead and jump in

216
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.075
to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

217
00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:52.415

(dragon roaring)

MATT: And welcome back.

255
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.933
God dammit.

256
00:11:30.933 --> 00:11:31.766
TRAVIS: (laughs)

257
00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:32.670
SAM: That was a good one.

258
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.664
MATT: Well done.
TALIESIN: That was good.

259
00:11:34.664 --> 00:11:39.664
MATT: So last we left off, the Mighty Nein,

260
00:11:39.837 --> 00:11:42.918
after traversing the King's Cage,

261
00:11:42.918 --> 00:11:46.695
losing their friend, Yasha, to the will of Obann,

262
00:11:46.695 --> 00:11:50.235
and narrowly escaping the danger of the Laughing Hand,

263
00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:53.557
you gathered yourselves, returned to Rosohna,

264
00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:57.202
informed the Bright Queen of what had transpired,

265
00:11:57.202 --> 00:12:01.646
and began to assess the best course of action going forward.

266
00:12:01.646 --> 00:12:05.174
You heard that the series of attacks

267
00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:07.779
that you seemed to have picked up via scrying

268
00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:10.943
had seemingly gone on and have been thwarted

269
00:12:10.943 --> 00:12:13.156
thanks to the information provided,

270
00:12:13.156 --> 00:12:16.097
and a number of the assassinations attempts

271
00:12:16.097 --> 00:12:19.332
by Scourgers were also thwarted, one of which was captured.

272
00:12:19.332 --> 00:12:21.459
You went ahead and attempted to make contact with them

273
00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:24.037
in the dungeon, and discovered it was

274
00:12:24.037 --> 00:12:26.509
not somebody you recognize.

275
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:29.988
You returned to your house, figured out

276
00:12:29.988 --> 00:12:34.710
a bit of a plan where the next point of direction is to be,

277
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.968
had a bit of a lore dump of Caduceus' background

278
00:12:37.968 --> 00:12:40.401
and personal goals,

279
00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.835
and as you were taking a bit of time

280
00:12:43.835 --> 00:12:48.208
to relax and center yourselves at the Xhorhouse,

281
00:12:49.624 --> 00:12:54.624
the arrival of one Dairon, currently obfuscated

282
00:12:54.624 --> 00:12:58.790
in drow form, arrived, saw Jester upon the balcony,

283
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:02.059
and then was notified of Beauregard being below,

284
00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:05.071
after which she hopped down, approached Beauregard

285
00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:09.358
on the stoop of the Xhorhouse, and requested her attention

286
00:13:09.358 --> 00:13:12.053
to meet on the the inside.

287
00:13:12.053 --> 00:13:14.088
And that is where we left off.

288
00:13:14.088 --> 00:13:17.288
So Beauregard.

289
00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:25.579
As the door opens, and Dairon pushes into the building,

290
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.617
what do you do?

291
00:13:27.617 --> 00:13:29.416
MARISHA: Just be quiet.

292
00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:32.083
I don't want to alert the whole house, okay?

293
00:13:33.909 --> 00:13:35.817
Let's go upstairs.

294
00:13:35.817 --> 00:13:37.272
LAURA: Yes, go upstairs.

295
00:13:37.272 --> 00:13:39.331
MARISHA: Shh, Jester.

296
00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:40.662
Let's go to the roof.

297
00:13:40.662 --> 00:13:43.036
Or wait, is Caduceus on the roof?

298
00:13:43.036 --> 00:13:43.869
Fuck.

299
00:13:45.092 --> 00:13:46.279
Let's stay down here.

300
00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:47.442
We'll just stay here.

301
00:13:47.442 --> 00:13:48.275
Let's just stay here.

302
00:13:48.275 --> 00:13:49.294
LAURA: Hey.
MARISHA: What?

303
00:13:49.294 --> 00:13:51.461
LAURA: We'll go to the hot tub!

304
00:13:53.122 --> 00:13:54.563
MARISHA: Is this conversation appropriate

305
00:13:54.563 --> 00:13:55.746
to have in a hot tub?

306
00:13:55.746 --> 00:13:57.701
(laughter)

307
00:13:57.701 --> 00:13:59.125
MARISHA: Would that be weird?

308
00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:02.413
LAURA: It's a really private room and stuff.

309
00:14:02.413 --> 00:14:03.804
MATT: "We can speak around it,

310
00:14:03.804 --> 00:14:05.645
"but I would prefer not to get in."

311
00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:06.921
MARISHA: Yeah.

312
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:08.887
Yeah, you don't have to get in.

313
00:14:08.887 --> 00:14:10.609
Is it weird if I get in and you don't?

314
00:14:10.609 --> 00:14:11.579
(laughter)

315
00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:12.412
MARISHA: Never mind.

316
00:14:12.412 --> 00:14:13.626
MATT: "Let us not meet at the hot tub."

317
00:14:13.626 --> 00:14:15.844
MARISHA: Okay. We'll just not meet at the hot tub.

318
00:14:15.844 --> 00:14:18.497
MATT: "Just a small private room, please."

319
00:14:18.497 --> 00:14:19.938
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

320
00:14:19.938 --> 00:14:23.878
Jester, let's go to our bedroom, or your bedroom.

321
00:14:23.878 --> 00:14:26.478
Let's just go upstairs.

322
00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:30.494
MATT: Okay, so you guys, all three of you head up into--

323
00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:31.728
MARISHA: Fuck the war room.

324
00:14:31.728 --> 00:14:34.066
(laughter)

325
00:14:34.066 --> 00:14:36.036
MATT: Let's not use it for its actual purpose.

326
00:14:36.036 --> 00:14:37.795
(laughter)

327
00:14:37.795 --> 00:14:38.840
MATT: In one of the few opportunities it could

328
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.353
possibly be functionally done.

329
00:14:42.353 --> 00:14:43.911
All right.

330
00:14:43.911 --> 00:14:48.467
You lead Dairon up into your guys' dual chamber.

331
00:14:48.467 --> 00:14:52.831
Close the door behind. Dairon you can now see,

332
00:14:52.831 --> 00:14:55.480
as you're walking alongside and leading her,

333
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.107
and she is nursing one arm a little bit.

334
00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:01.501
MARISHA: What happened?
MATT: You can see the bandage.

335
00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:03.272
MARISHA: Pretty fucked up?

336
00:15:03.272 --> 00:15:04.563
MATT: "I'm fine.

337
00:15:04.563 --> 00:15:08.134
"It is a dangerous way to come across to Rosohna,

338
00:15:08.134 --> 00:15:09.885
"but I'll be all right."

339
00:15:09.885 --> 00:15:11.832
LAURA: Do you want a Cure Wounds on you?

340
00:15:11.832 --> 00:15:14.539
Because I can cast spells. I'm a cleric.

341
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:20.281
MATT: She just holds the hand out in your direction.

342
00:15:20.281 --> 00:15:21.379
LAURA: Cure Wounds.

343
00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.491
(laughter)

344
00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:24.411
MATT: Through the power of camera lens.

345
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:25.723
LAURA: I will do it at 2nd-level.

346
00:15:25.723 --> 00:15:26.935
MATT: 2nd-level, go ahead and roll.

347
00:15:26.935 --> 00:15:28.602
LAURA: Yeah, I will.

348
00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:33.018
I got to figure out how to do this.

349
00:15:33.018 --> 00:15:34.978
Okay, wait, wait, we have an app.

350
00:15:34.978 --> 00:15:38.587
I'll rolling 2d8 plus five.

351
00:15:39.763 --> 00:15:41.881
SAM: You're not using dice?

352
00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:43.083
LAURA: 11.

353
00:15:43.083 --> 00:15:45.182
MATT: 11, all right.

354
00:15:45.182 --> 00:15:47.613
LAURA: I have a d20,

355
00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:48.997
but I don't have other dice.

356
00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:50.453
MATT: That's all you need.

357
00:15:50.453 --> 00:15:51.453
SAM: The hotel might have some.

358
00:15:51.453 --> 00:15:55.836
MATT: Yeah, just go and check with the concierge.

359
00:15:55.836 --> 00:16:00.836
The somewhat bandaged and crimson bandages

360
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.824
that are hidden beneath the arm

361
00:16:04.824 --> 00:16:08.074
slightly fall off the arm, go loose,

362
00:16:08.074 --> 00:16:11.034
and Dairon pulls them and throws them to the ground,

363
00:16:11.034 --> 00:16:12.155
just leaving them limp there.

364
00:16:12.155 --> 00:16:14.266
You can see the scratches where wounds may have been

365
00:16:14.266 --> 00:16:15.874
seem to have sealed off.

366
00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:17.220
She doesn't say thank you, but gives you

367
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.220
a nod of acknowledgment.

368
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.640
"So I can only say I have many questions.

369
00:16:26.312 --> 00:16:28.549
"What are you doing here?

370
00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:30.568
"How do you have a house?

371
00:16:30.568 --> 00:16:35.568
"How are you staying outside as a human in Rosohna?

372
00:16:36.324 --> 00:16:38.299
"What have you been up to?

373
00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:40.318
"Why is there a tree on the roof?"

374
00:16:40.318 --> 00:16:41.903
(laughter)

375
00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:43.153
MARISHA: Yeah.

376
00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:45.686
No, you're right, it's super weird

377
00:16:45.686 --> 00:16:47.276
when you lay it all out like that.

378
00:16:47.276 --> 00:16:49.656
MATT: "I'm just beginning, but we'll start with that."

379
00:16:49.656 --> 00:16:52.689
MARISHA: Okay, well, hang on, first off,

380
00:16:52.689 --> 00:16:54.405
don't get upset with me,

381
00:16:54.405 --> 00:16:57.240
I'm doing exactly what you told me to do,

382
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.509
which is travel the world, seek corruption,

383
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:02.928
find dark evils--

384
00:17:02.928 --> 00:17:04.767
MATT: "I'm not upset, I'm just confused.

385
00:17:04.767 --> 00:17:07.963
"I know for me, the two look very similar."

386
00:17:07.963 --> 00:17:09.538
MARISHA: Yeah.

387
00:17:10.693 --> 00:17:14.361
Man, people wonder where I get it from.

388
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:15.650
LAURA: Now I know.

389
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.279
MARISHA: Yeah.

390
00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:18.928
What are you doing here?

391
00:17:18.928 --> 00:17:20.655
MATT: "I asked <i>you</i> questions first."

392
00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:24.483
MARISHA: I know, and I am asking you questions back.

393
00:17:24.483 --> 00:17:26.558
MATT: "Very well, I'm doing the exact same thing

394
00:17:26.558 --> 00:17:27.915
"I told you I was coming here to do,

395
00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:30.809
"which was to infiltrate and look for information

396
00:17:30.809 --> 00:17:34.178
"about some sort of connection between the Assembly

397
00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:37.913
"and possibly members of the Dynasty."

398
00:17:37.913 --> 00:17:41.191
MARISHA: Yeah, I think those are actually happening.

399
00:17:41.191 --> 00:17:43.647
We've figured some of that shit out.

400
00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:47.329
I would love to converse with you and share shit,

401
00:17:47.329 --> 00:17:49.527
but don't-- are you going to get mad at me?

402
00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.077
Are you going to get mad at me?

403
00:17:51.077 --> 00:17:53.162
MATT: "It depends on how you came about this information,

404
00:17:53.162 --> 00:17:55.221
"but please go on."

405
00:17:56.584 --> 00:17:57.417
MARISHA: (sighs)

406
00:17:57.417 --> 00:18:00.344
LAURA: Do you want me to leave?

407
00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:01.476
MARISHA: No, it's fine.

408
00:18:01.476 --> 00:18:06.204
Stay here in case, you know, I forget anything.

409
00:18:06.204 --> 00:18:08.594
LAURA: Okay, I sit down on the bed and start eating my

410
00:18:08.594 --> 00:18:10.187
snacks that I hid under the bed.

411
00:18:10.187 --> 00:18:12.721
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

412
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:14.875
MARISHA: All right, so it all started because

413
00:18:14.875 --> 00:18:16.677
we found this thing that we

414
00:18:16.677 --> 00:18:19.173
just started referring to as the dodecahedron,

415
00:18:19.173 --> 00:18:21.575
and you would look into it and you could see

416
00:18:21.575 --> 00:18:24.577
space-time and a lot of like, you know,

417
00:18:24.577 --> 00:18:27.578
"fragments of possibilities," which turns out

418
00:18:27.578 --> 00:18:32.578
it's what it was called, and that led us

419
00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:36.917
getting involved with some Kryn soldiers,

420
00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:41.183
and then we thought, hey,

421
00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:45.632
what if we go to Xhorhas?

422
00:18:47.314 --> 00:18:48.609
And now we're here.

423
00:18:48.609 --> 00:18:52.198
I mean, that's kind of what happened, right?

424
00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:53.534
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

425
00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:55.463
MATT: "And you just decided to buy some real estate

426
00:18:55.463 --> 00:18:57.258
"while you were around, and--"

427
00:18:57.258 --> 00:18:59.916
LAURA: We didn't buy it, they just gave it to us.

428
00:18:59.916 --> 00:19:01.548
MATT: "Who gave it to you?"

429
00:19:01.548 --> 00:19:04.419
MARISHA: The Bright Queen.
LAURA: The people.

430
00:19:04.419 --> 00:19:07.702
MATT: "And why would the Bright Queen

431
00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:09.993
"of the Kryn Dynasty

432
00:19:09.993 --> 00:19:13.339
"provide you, a bunch of Empire folk,

433
00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:15.994
"a house so close to the Bastion?"

434
00:19:15.994 --> 00:19:19.651
MARISHA: Well, we returned their

435
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:22.525
fragment of possibility to them,

436
00:19:22.525 --> 00:19:26.941
which was stolen with members

437
00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:30.050
of the Cerberus Assembly.

438
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.015
And they have the other ones, which is

439
00:19:32.015 --> 00:19:35.598
why this war is happening,

440
00:19:35.598 --> 00:19:39.223
on top of, I think, other things, like people

441
00:19:41.823 --> 00:19:45.417
in cahoots across both of the Empires.

442
00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:46.565
MATT: "I'm going to be honest.

443
00:19:46.565 --> 00:19:49.757
"This war was going to happen eventually,

444
00:19:49.757 --> 00:19:52.750
"with the proximity and the expansion

445
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.977
"and interest politically of both sides.

446
00:19:54.977 --> 00:19:57.430
"The beacons, which I think is what you are talking about--"

447
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.776
MARISHA: Yeah, those things.

448
00:19:58.776 --> 00:20:02.357
MATT: "I have heard whispers of them internally

449
00:20:02.357 --> 00:20:05.465
"back in the Empire."

450
00:20:05.465 --> 00:20:06.298
(sighs)

451
00:20:06.298 --> 00:20:09.542
"I think that was just the catalyst.

452
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:13.828
"I don't believe they were entirely stolen, either.

453
00:20:13.828 --> 00:20:15.814
"Even the Assembly would be hard pressed

454
00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:19.535
"to reach and escape with such artifacts."

455
00:20:19.535 --> 00:20:22.818
MARISHA: You think someone handed them over or staged it?

456
00:20:22.818 --> 00:20:23.913
LAURA: To set up a war?

457
00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:25.302
MARISHA: To set up a war? Yeah.

458
00:20:25.302 --> 00:20:28.234
MATT: "It's possible, or to make a bunch of money,

459
00:20:28.234 --> 00:20:31.178
"or to gain favors in kind."

460
00:20:31.178 --> 00:20:33.232
(sighs)

461
00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:36.653
"I'm here because I'm trying to figure out

462
00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:40.007
"not just an Assembly's connection from them to here,

463
00:20:40.007 --> 00:20:44.199
but perhaps there was a mid-way person, somebody who

464
00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:50.551
"somebody on this end who had equal interests."

465
00:20:53.242 --> 00:20:55.575
MARISHA: It seems you aren't wrong.

466
00:20:56.409 --> 00:21:00.882
We've heard similar rumors about the Dynasty

467
00:21:00.882 --> 00:21:04.649
looking for a fight.

468
00:21:05.684 --> 00:21:08.344
They've been very unhappy with us for quite some time,

469
00:21:08.344 --> 00:21:11.418
as you can imagine, "us" being the Empire,

470
00:21:11.418 --> 00:21:16.143
and I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back.

471
00:21:16.143 --> 00:21:20.444
When conversing with the Bright Queen,

472
00:21:20.444 --> 00:21:23.168
she didn't seem to have any notion

473
00:21:23.168 --> 00:21:26.251
of wanting to relinquish any attacks.

474
00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:30.653
MATT: "Not while we still have access or are controlling

475
00:21:30.653 --> 00:21:34.488
"any more of their beacons, definitely.

476
00:21:34.488 --> 00:21:39.488
"(sighs) Look, there are many things at play here, and

477
00:21:43.982 --> 00:21:46.886
"from what I've been able to figure out,

478
00:21:46.886 --> 00:21:50.114
"there have been many rising tensions for decades

479
00:21:50.114 --> 00:21:52.771
"between the two sides.

480
00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:56.629
"If these items, these artifacts could be returned,

481
00:21:56.629 --> 00:22:00.472
"that would be helpful in hopefully trying to prevent

482
00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:03.864
"any more bloodshed, but it is escalating at a pace that

483
00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:08.605
"I'm only hearing bits and pieces from back in the Empire."

484
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.243
MARISHA: On top of that,

485
00:22:12.243 --> 00:22:16.326
I think there's another war

486
00:22:16.326 --> 00:22:20.836
happening on top of all of this,

487
00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:25.826
beyond other realms and other planar dimensions.

488
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:31.262
I think there's a fight brewing

489
00:22:31.262 --> 00:22:35.399
between angels and demons.

490
00:22:35.399 --> 00:22:39.599
And it might happen here,

491
00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:41.340
in the material plane.

492
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.289
I don't know.

493
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:44.428
That's another little--

494
00:22:44.428 --> 00:22:47.763
LAURA: I think that's valid.

495
00:22:47.763 --> 00:22:49.652
MARISHA: That's another really huge thing

496
00:22:49.652 --> 00:22:51.380
that's also been going on,

497
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.620
and at first I thought that maybe it was a distraction

498
00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:00.562
or a device or plant from the Empire or Xhorhas.

499
00:23:02.606 --> 00:23:04.151
But I don't know.

500
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:05.503
It might be bigger than that, it might be

501
00:23:05.503 --> 00:23:10.233
bigger than all of us, and I don't know if anyone cares,

502
00:23:10.233 --> 00:23:14.483
because everyone is so wrapped up in this fucking war.

503
00:23:17.882 --> 00:23:20.715
MATT: "And which side do you belong to?"

504
00:23:23.359 --> 00:23:25.827
MARISHA: I don't belong to any side.

505
00:23:25.827 --> 00:23:28.521
I told you that when you first asked me

506
00:23:28.521 --> 00:23:31.521
if I even wanted to be an Expositor.

507
00:23:32.595 --> 00:23:35.484
MATT: "Then understand this path is a very difficult one."

508
00:23:35.484 --> 00:23:36.317
MARISHA: Yeah.

509
00:23:37.476 --> 00:23:41.852
MATT: "It will come with hard decisions
with hard consequences.

510
00:23:41.852 --> 00:23:45.569
"You're prepared for that still, with what you've seen?"

511
00:23:47.778 --> 00:23:49.038
MARISHA: What side are you on?

512
00:23:49.038 --> 00:23:50.371
Do you have one?

513
00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:56.239
Is the Soul exclusive to the Empire?

514
00:23:58.268 --> 00:24:01.943
MATT: "I am on the side of civilization."

515
00:24:02.913 --> 00:24:05.347
LAURA: Yeah, that.

516
00:24:05.347 --> 00:24:07.213
I agree.

517
00:24:08.317 --> 00:24:11.948
Sorry. Keep going, you guys are doing really good.

518
00:24:11.948 --> 00:24:13.660
(laughter)

519
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.243
MATT: She raises-- they, she and they.

520
00:24:16.243 --> 00:24:21.235
They raise a stern eyebrow in your direction,

521
00:24:22.397 --> 00:24:26.654
and with a slight skip-step forward,

522
00:24:26.654 --> 00:24:29.379
snatches one of the snacks out from one of your hands.

523
00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:30.879
LAURA: Oh!

524
00:24:31.749 --> 00:24:34.027
I put the bowl in front.

525
00:24:34.027 --> 00:24:36.494
MATT: She puts her hand up and denies it.

526
00:24:36.494 --> 00:24:38.634
MARISHA: You could have asked.

527
00:24:38.634 --> 00:24:41.485
LAURA: I don't mind, it's okay,
I like to share. It's okay.

528
00:24:41.485 --> 00:24:43.625
MATT: "Have you known me to be the type to ask nicely?"

529
00:24:43.625 --> 00:24:45.592
MARISHA: No, but it's something that <i>I'm</i> working on,

530
00:24:45.592 --> 00:24:48.630
so I thought maybe we could work on it together.

531
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.947
MATT: "I think that should be <i>your</i> skill set, then.

532
00:24:51.947 --> 00:24:54.197
"It does not belong in mine.

533
00:24:56.285 --> 00:25:01.285
"Well, while I despise some of those in power,

534
00:25:01.534 --> 00:25:05.900
"I grew up in the Empire, and I do all of this

535
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.896
"to maintain the order for those

00:25:07.896 --> 00:25:10.396
"who cannot protect themselves.

537
00:25:11.387 --> 00:25:15.220
I know not much on this side

538
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.203
of the conflict,

539
00:25:17.203 --> 00:25:21.520
"but from what I've seen, there are elements

540
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.120
"of good and bad as well.

541
00:25:25.548 --> 00:25:29.961
"Even my own prejudices have come to question.

542
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:33.710
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in my time,

543
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:38.210
"political power is rarely wielded by those

544
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:42.955
"who can withstand to be siren's call of abusing it.

545
00:25:43.968 --> 00:25:47.234
"Especially when zealotry is involved."

546
00:25:50.199 --> 00:25:54.496
MARISHA: I don't know if she can be reasoned with,

547
00:25:54.496 --> 00:25:55.913
the Bright Queen.

548
00:25:57.335 --> 00:25:59.418
MATT: "Then there is a war."

549
00:25:59.418 --> 00:26:04.418
MARISHA: There's got to be a way to
dismantle it from the inside.

550
00:26:04.903 --> 00:26:06.394
That's what--

551
00:26:07.278 --> 00:26:09.478
That's what we do, right?

552
00:26:10.321 --> 00:26:12.982
MATT: "The next step would be to try and recover

553
00:26:12.982 --> 00:26:17.168
"what other beacons might be currently held by the Empire.

554
00:26:17.168 --> 00:26:19.716
"That'll be the first step to trying to make this right,

555
00:26:19.716 --> 00:26:24.164
"but as long as we hold something that is so important

556
00:26:24.164 --> 00:26:28.664
"culturally to them, they have no reason to stand down.

557
00:26:29.977 --> 00:26:33.560
"And at the moment they have the upper hand."

558
00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:43.062
MARISHA: I'm willing to compare notes if you are,

559
00:26:43.062 --> 00:26:45.062
but I want to make a deal.

560
00:26:47.328 --> 00:26:52.294
I think what we're doing-- the Mighty Nein--

561
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.163
I think we have this rare fraction of a chance

562
00:27:00.422 --> 00:27:04.314
that we might be able to do something from the inside,

563
00:27:06.803 --> 00:27:09.603
but the Cobalt Soul has to stay out of my way.

564
00:27:09.603 --> 00:27:10.936
They don't know.

565
00:27:13.329 --> 00:27:16.185
The Dynasty has no whiff of me being a part

566
00:27:16.185 --> 00:27:19.185
of any type of Empire establishment.

567
00:27:20.875 --> 00:27:24.966
You cannot jeopardize that.

568
00:27:26.907 --> 00:27:29.074
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

569
00:27:33.996 --> 00:27:35.527
MARISHA: (quietly) Fucking shit.

570
00:27:35.527 --> 00:27:36.963
Persuasion?

571
00:27:36.963 --> 00:27:37.799
It's not good.

572
00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:38.632
Eight?

573
00:27:38.632 --> 00:27:39.465
MATT: Eight.

574
00:27:48.372 --> 00:27:52.852
"I'll tell you this, you continue to do what you wish to do,

575
00:27:52.852 --> 00:27:55.611
"I'll continue to doing mine.

576
00:27:55.611 --> 00:27:59.248
"We have our independent means of achieving

577
00:27:59.248 --> 00:28:01.831
"what we hope is a similar goal."

578
00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:07.305
MARISHA: What exactly are you doing right now?

579
00:28:07.305 --> 00:28:09.670
MATT: "Looking to expunge whatever corruption

580
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.337
"reaches between both sides of this conflict."

581
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.073
MARISHA: Have you heard of a man named Obann?

582
00:28:19.791 --> 00:28:21.320
MATT: "I do not believe I have."

583
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.153
MARISHA: Okay.

584
00:28:23.411 --> 00:28:27.764
MATT: "But you, seemingly, fraternizing with the leader

585
00:28:27.764 --> 00:28:32.756
"of the enemy, have some pull within the Dynasty?"

586
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.560
MARISHA: I don't know if I have pull,

587
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.500
but I would say that I have passage.

588
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.309
LAURA: I pull out the symbol.

589
00:28:49.121 --> 00:28:52.788
MATT: "How long do you intend to stay in Rosohna?"

590
00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:57.381
MARISHA: Not long.

591
00:28:58.612 --> 00:29:00.993
We're heading north.

592
00:29:00.993 --> 00:29:03.243
MATT: "Then let me ask you this.

593
00:29:04.156 --> 00:29:08.576
"Lend me one of your sigils and introduce me

594
00:29:08.576 --> 00:29:11.851
"to one of your contacts as a

595
00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:15.903
"trustworthy representative.

596
00:29:15.903 --> 00:29:20.467
"That would help me get closer to achieving my goals,

597
00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:25.375
"and we do not have to cross our directives."

598
00:29:27.514 --> 00:29:31.101
LAURA: The only thing is is we only have the one sigil.

599
00:29:31.101 --> 00:29:32.178
Just this one.

600
00:29:32.178 --> 00:29:34.648
MATT: "Then let me borrow it until you return."

601
00:29:34.648 --> 00:29:38.027
MARISHA: We need it to pass through the Dynasty.

602
00:29:38.027 --> 00:29:42.450
I am not looked at very kindly here.

603
00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:43.625
MATT: "Well if you intend to leave, I will

604
00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:45.699
"walk you to your point of exit,

605
00:29:45.699 --> 00:29:48.539
"to where you no longer require it."

606
00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:51.878
MARISHA: It has been useful across the entire Empire--

607
00:29:51.878 --> 00:29:54.518
MATT: "Very well, if it's an issue,
then at least introduce me,

608
00:29:54.518 --> 00:29:58.251
"and give me some sort of--

609
00:30:00.176 --> 00:30:03.651
some sort of connection that I can utilize.

610
00:30:05.247 --> 00:30:09.218
"I'm impressed by what you've managed to do in this time,

611
00:30:09.218 --> 00:30:12.878
"and probably with the help of your compatriots,

612
00:30:12.878 --> 00:30:15.895
"with the varied skill sets, I have

613
00:30:15.895 --> 00:30:20.427
"a handful of very powerful and honed capabilities,

614
00:30:20.427 --> 00:30:23.410
"but they are still limited."

615
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.973
MARISHA: We handed over a prized religious artifact

616
00:30:27.973 --> 00:30:30.977
of the Dynasty in order to achieve

617
00:30:30.977 --> 00:30:33.891
this type of favor, and any type of contacts.

618
00:30:33.891 --> 00:30:36.987
LAURA: And also so we wouldn't die.

619
00:30:36.987 --> 00:30:41.254
MARISHA: Yeah, actually that was like, reason number one.

620
00:30:41.254 --> 00:30:42.521
My point is,

621
00:30:45.884 --> 00:30:49.559
I don't foresee any

622
00:30:49.559 --> 00:30:51.784
appropriate way of introducing you

623
00:30:51.784 --> 00:30:56.464
to our contacts, unless you have some use to them,

624
00:30:58.232 --> 00:31:01.504
or some means of gaining their trust.

625
00:31:01.504 --> 00:31:03.298
So what do you have to offer?

626
00:31:03.298 --> 00:31:05.232
Other than that, it's just going to be,

627
00:31:05.232 --> 00:31:10.232
"Hey, contact, meet my friend, she's in town

628
00:31:10.715 --> 00:31:11.856
"for the fall.

629
00:31:11.856 --> 00:31:13.876
"You know, exchange student."

630
00:31:13.876 --> 00:31:17.430
LAURA: Yeah. And I mean, you know, we've worked really hard

631
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.408
to integrate ourselves and stuff,

632
00:31:19.408 --> 00:31:22.110
but the thing I'm a little worried about

633
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.646
is that they don't actually trust us fully,

634
00:31:24.646 --> 00:31:26.837
so if anything happened--

635
00:31:26.837 --> 00:31:29.810
MARISHA: You have the ability to change your appearance.

636
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.560
It's not what I have.

637
00:31:33.054 --> 00:31:35.543
MATT: "I would hope you would understand
that even such magics

638
00:31:35.543 --> 00:31:37.662
"have limitations, especially in places

639
00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:40.254
"of extreme importance.

640
00:31:40.254 --> 00:31:43.138
"This paltry trick can get me through the exterior

641
00:31:43.138 --> 00:31:47.467
"of various city outer limits, but interacting

642
00:31:47.467 --> 00:31:50.210
"towards the center or important areas,

643
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.445
"it would not surprise me if such illusions

644
00:31:52.445 --> 00:31:56.897
"or transmutive properties would be
dispelled or discarded,

645
00:31:56.897 --> 00:31:59.731
"and that would put me very quickly in a place

646
00:31:59.731 --> 00:32:02.949
"of no longer breathing, so--"

647
00:32:02.949 --> 00:32:04.267
MARISHA: I don't want that.

648
00:32:04.267 --> 00:32:05.558
MATT: "Neither do I.

649
00:32:05.558 --> 00:32:07.419
"I've come this far.

650
00:32:07.419 --> 00:32:09.538
"Both of us have come this far."

651
00:32:09.538 --> 00:32:11.410
MARISHA: Then what is the plan?

652
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:12.576
MATT: "You tell me.

653
00:32:12.576 --> 00:32:16.942
"I'm asking you as the one who has been here far longer,

654
00:32:16.942 --> 00:32:21.425
"knows more of the inner workings of these people.

655
00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:28.900
"I want to know your insights, Beauregard, as an Expositor.

656
00:32:30.208 --> 00:32:35.133
"What do you think would be the most useful way

657
00:32:35.133 --> 00:32:37.219
"to leave me behind to do my business

658
00:32:37.219 --> 00:32:39.886
"while go off and search for yours?"

659
00:32:45.472 --> 00:32:48.114
MARISHA: We might need a ward.

660
00:32:51.348 --> 00:32:53.589
Nott's husband is here.

661
00:32:56.148 --> 00:32:57.239
We could--

662
00:32:58.153 --> 00:33:01.666
We do have the means to get him to safety.

663
00:33:01.666 --> 00:33:04.618
The plan was to potentially get him to Nicodranas.

664
00:33:05.585 --> 00:33:07.918
LAURA: That's where my mom lives.

665
00:33:10.436 --> 00:33:15.424
MARISHA: I would have to discuss it
with the others, especially Nott,

666
00:33:15.424 --> 00:33:19.074
but that could be a potential

667
00:33:19.074 --> 00:33:23.323
cause for your company.

668
00:33:24.542 --> 00:33:27.890
MATT: "At the very least, a keeper of the abode

669
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:32.890
"so I'm not slinking in the shadows
the entire time I'm here."

670
00:33:33.377 --> 00:33:37.603
LAURA: Sure, we can say we hired you.

671
00:33:37.603 --> 00:33:39.553
MATT: "That's something."

672
00:33:42.172 --> 00:33:43.851
MARISHA: This is not making me feel good

673
00:33:43.851 --> 00:33:47.018
towards our deal of not being exposed.

674
00:33:48.551 --> 00:33:51.051
Being involved with the Reserve.

675
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:53.453
MATT: "Then it is your choice to say no.

676
00:33:53.453 --> 00:33:55.536
"You do not have to agree."

677
00:33:57.088 --> 00:33:59.280
MARISHA: (quietly) Fuck.

678
00:34:03.082 --> 00:34:04.215
Um--

679
00:34:06.207 --> 00:34:08.040
Would you give me a minute?

680
00:34:09.029 --> 00:34:11.601
I mean, just a minute.

681
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:14.827
Will you go get a beer or something?

682
00:34:14.827 --> 00:34:18.530
LAURA: Go take a dip in the hot tub, it's really relaxing.

683
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.208
MATT: Dairon leaves the room and just closes the door

684
00:34:21.208 --> 00:34:23.349
behind them out in the hallway.

685
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:26.623
MARISHA: Don't listen in, doing your spy shit.

686
00:34:26.623 --> 00:34:29.847
I know, you taught me.

687
00:34:31.482 --> 00:34:33.431
MATT: No response.

688
00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:35.129
LAURA: She's totally listening.

689
00:34:35.129 --> 00:34:36.709
MARISHA: She's totally listening.

690
00:34:36.709 --> 00:34:37.859
LAURA: Yeah.

691
00:34:39.116 --> 00:34:41.283
MARISHA: What do you think, Jess?

692
00:34:43.296 --> 00:34:46.963
LAURA: I think it puts us at risk, honestly.

693
00:34:50.087 --> 00:34:54.328
But if she's important to you, then maybe that's worth it.

694
00:34:58.229 --> 00:34:59.713
MARISHA: She could help.

695
00:34:59.713 --> 00:35:04.713
She could be a bigger risk just being in the city

696
00:35:04.733 --> 00:35:07.241
at odds, potentially, with our plans,

697
00:35:07.241 --> 00:35:11.970
or working against what we might be sowing in the Dynasty.

698
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.890
LAURA: But I thought she said she doesn't work

699
00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.292
for the Empire, right?

700
00:35:15.292 --> 00:35:20.225
She works for civilization, humanity?

701
00:35:21.987 --> 00:35:24.112
All of-- all of the world?

702
00:35:25.403 --> 00:35:26.686
MARISHA: I mean, like she said, though,

703
00:35:26.686 --> 00:35:28.469
still doesn't mean she's not

704
00:35:28.469 --> 00:35:31.522
immune to her own biases.

705
00:35:31.522 --> 00:35:33.556
LAURA: Yeah.

706
00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:35.746
MARISHA: (sighs)

707
00:35:35.746 --> 00:35:37.293
LAURA: I trust you, Beau.

708
00:35:37.293 --> 00:35:39.481
Whatever you think.

709
00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:40.731
MARISHA: Fuck.

710
00:35:43.932 --> 00:35:45.457
Fuck, all right.

711
00:35:47.929 --> 00:35:49.525
I'm going to go talk to her.

712
00:35:49.525 --> 00:35:51.108
I'll be right back.

713
00:35:53.048 --> 00:35:54.324
I go out in the hall.

714
00:35:54.324 --> 00:35:55.173
MATT: Okay.

715
00:35:55.173 --> 00:35:56.581
As you step out into the hallway,

716
00:35:56.581 --> 00:36:00.962
about 10 or so feet down, Dairon's just leaning against--

717
00:36:00.962 --> 00:36:03.153
shoulders pressed against the wall,

718
00:36:03.153 --> 00:36:05.510
slowly turns her head towards you.

719
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.343
MARISHA: Let's go downstairs.

720
00:36:08.395 --> 00:36:11.137
MATT: Gives a head nudge and then follows behind.

721
00:36:12.862 --> 00:36:17.612
As you're walking down, Dairon just says under her voice,

722
00:36:19.523 --> 00:36:21.758
"Look, my coming here I already understood

723
00:36:21.758 --> 00:36:23.758
"to be a suicide mission.

724
00:36:24.972 --> 00:36:27.648
"I've already made my peace with that.

725
00:36:27.648 --> 00:36:30.275
"If you truly believe that I am going to put

726
00:36:30.275 --> 00:36:35.242
"the rest of you in danger, then I would not wish to

727
00:36:37.014 --> 00:36:39.977
"make this as dangerous for the rest of you

728
00:36:39.977 --> 00:36:42.810
"as I agreed to make it for myself.

729
00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:47.508
"At the very least, just give me a name.

730
00:36:48.944 --> 00:36:52.009
"It'll be a harder-fought path for me, but

731
00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:57.008
"I don't wish to undo anything you've already set up."

732
00:37:01.614 --> 00:37:04.016
MARISHA: It doesn't have to be a suicide mission,

733
00:37:04.016 --> 00:37:06.349
and it shouldn't have to be.

734
00:37:08.763 --> 00:37:13.014
The Expositors should be able to work together as a network.

735
00:37:13.855 --> 00:37:16.023
Working individually, we're going to get nowhere

736
00:37:16.023 --> 00:37:18.331
and run in circles.

737
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:28.300
I know you're my mentor, and I still have a lot to learn.

738
00:37:29.318 --> 00:37:34.032
But if we're going to do this, you have to listen to me,

739
00:37:34.032 --> 00:37:35.790
and trust me.

740
00:37:37.859 --> 00:37:39.859
(sighs)

741
00:37:41.288 --> 00:37:43.455
MATT: "Then you tell me, Beauregard."

742
00:37:49.755 --> 00:37:51.047
MARISHA: We'll talk in the morning about you

743
00:37:51.047 --> 00:37:53.702
maybe being our ward, with the others.

744
00:37:54.677 --> 00:37:56.594
A name will come later.

745
00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:00.725
Until then,

746
00:38:03.812 --> 00:38:05.479
let's compare notes.

747
00:38:07.123 --> 00:38:10.860
And I take the next however long it takes

748
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.596
to go through and tell her everything about the portals

749
00:38:14.596 --> 00:38:19.596
and splitting into the Abyss, and Obann,

750
00:38:19.978 --> 00:38:23.947
and the Laughing Hand, and the connection, and all of that.

751
00:38:23.947 --> 00:38:25.164
MATT: Okay, great.

752
00:38:25.164 --> 00:38:26.604
MARISHA: And the war machines.

753
00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:27.732
MATT: All right.

754
00:38:27.732 --> 00:38:30.973
Information you get from Dairon

755
00:38:32.917 --> 00:38:36.374
involves the fact that, you know,

756
00:38:36.374 --> 00:38:38.988
she was doing other own research on the beacons,

757
00:38:38.988 --> 00:38:41.834
trying to find the points of what caused this conflict

758
00:38:41.834 --> 00:38:45.609
to begin, Assembly's direct involvement,

759
00:38:45.609 --> 00:38:49.973
and how the Expositors have intercepted

760
00:38:49.973 --> 00:38:52.433
some communications between the crown and the Assembly

761
00:38:52.433 --> 00:38:55.359
regarding research into these beacons

762
00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:58.476
and whatever properties they contain,

763
00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:03.355
though the information has been very vague,

764
00:39:03.355 --> 00:39:05.930
as well as information regarding continuously moving them

765
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:09.375
from place to place, so they're not kept

766
00:39:09.375 --> 00:39:11.834
in a solitary location.

767
00:39:12.965 --> 00:39:14.795
As well as the frustration of one of them

768
00:39:14.795 --> 00:39:19.453
being recovered, or being absconded with.

769
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.353
Gives you a little point of pride

770
00:39:22.353 --> 00:39:25.072
when you get to that point.

771
00:39:25.072 --> 00:39:28.808
Dairon also notifies you that she has been in contact

772
00:39:28.808 --> 00:39:33.441
with the Archive, the library,

773
00:39:33.441 --> 00:39:34.854
back in Zadash.

774
00:39:34.854 --> 00:39:35.687
MARISHA: Yeah.

775
00:39:37.163 --> 00:39:40.830
MATT: That very recently, attempts to retake

776
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.657
the Ashguard Garrison have failed,

777
00:39:44.706 --> 00:39:47.288
at a loss of many lives,

778
00:39:47.288 --> 00:39:49.847
and Kryn assassins have managed to

779
00:39:49.847 --> 00:39:51.569
take out military-linked nobles

780
00:39:51.569 --> 00:39:55.627
in both Bladegarden and Zadash during that conflict.

781
00:39:57.524 --> 00:39:59.867
Also, Hupperdook apparently is mobilizing

782
00:39:59.867 --> 00:40:02.773
a next wave of experimental weaponry,

783
00:40:02.773 --> 00:40:05.399
and from what Dairon's been able to ascertain

784
00:40:05.399 --> 00:40:09.855
from her contacts, they seem to be developing

785
00:40:09.855 --> 00:40:12.998
small mobile war sky ships.

786
00:40:12.998 --> 00:40:15.627
SAM: Ooh.

787
00:40:15.627 --> 00:40:16.967
MARISHA: Yeah.

788
00:40:16.967 --> 00:40:19.078
I leave out all the stuff about

789
00:40:19.078 --> 00:40:24.025
being the one telling them about the attack.

790
00:40:24.025 --> 00:40:26.162
That's not what I tell her.

791
00:40:26.162 --> 00:40:27.445
MATT: Okay.

792
00:40:29.446 --> 00:40:31.613
But that does ring to you.

793
00:40:33.432 --> 00:40:36.265
You don't know to the extent, but--

794
00:40:37.464 --> 00:40:39.505
MARISHA: Do I gather

795
00:40:40.664 --> 00:40:43.297
that the Empire-Dynasty contact

796
00:40:43.297 --> 00:40:48.286
that she has been potentially looking for is us?

797
00:40:49.809 --> 00:40:51.067
Is it-- no?

798
00:40:52.017 --> 00:40:56.162
MATT: She doesn't seem to make that connection.

799
00:40:56.162 --> 00:40:58.160
MARISHA: But do <i>I</i> make that connection with the--

800
00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.632
MATT: No, the way that Dairon speaks about it,

801
00:41:00.632 --> 00:41:02.996
it's more about somebody who's been

802
00:41:02.996 --> 00:41:06.410
a liaison between since before the conflict began.

803
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:09.236
She knows that you guys have been Empire-side

804
00:41:09.236 --> 00:41:12.253
up until recently, and to be perfectly honest,

805
00:41:12.253 --> 00:41:14.151
from her standpoint, you gather that she also doesn't think

806
00:41:14.151 --> 00:41:17.237
you guys would be capable of such a thing.

807
00:41:17.237 --> 00:41:18.753
MARISHA: Good.

808
00:41:19.707 --> 00:41:22.739
MATT: Yeah, Dairon seems to be specifically looking--

809
00:41:22.739 --> 00:41:26.146
there is either somebody from the Empire,

810
00:41:26.146 --> 00:41:29.511
or most likely the Assembly, but somebody from the Empire

811
00:41:29.511 --> 00:41:34.345
that is coming and working with the Dynasty,

812
00:41:35.512 --> 00:41:40.227
like somebody here who is allowing them to take the beacons,

813
00:41:40.227 --> 00:41:44.402
or the beacons were then taken out of Rosohna

814
00:41:44.402 --> 00:41:47.666
and then delivered to the Empire.

815
00:41:47.666 --> 00:41:51.191
That's her theory.

816
00:41:52.111 --> 00:41:54.789
That's primarily what she came here to try and find,

817
00:41:54.789 --> 00:41:58.729
was to suss out any connections there,

818
00:41:58.729 --> 00:42:02.771
you know, what individuals might have

819
00:42:02.771 --> 00:42:04.927
some communication back and forth,

820
00:42:04.927 --> 00:42:06.473
and a motive specifically.

821
00:42:06.473 --> 00:42:07.663
LIAM: I know I'm not in on this,

822
00:42:07.663 --> 00:42:10.107
but implying that there's a major turncoat on each side?

823
00:42:10.107 --> 00:42:11.282
MATT: Possibly.

824
00:42:11.282 --> 00:42:12.744
SAM: Or one that goes back and forth.

825
00:42:12.744 --> 00:42:14.401
MATT: Or at least one turncoat very heavily in the Dynasty

826
00:42:14.401 --> 00:42:17.997
that was able to smuggle these beacons out.

827
00:42:17.997 --> 00:42:21.076
MARISHA: I mean, they would have to be so high ranked.

828
00:42:21.076 --> 00:42:22.489
MATT: Or very, very good.

829
00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:23.960
MARISHA: Or very, very good.

830
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.512
Do I have anything in my notes in comparison

831
00:42:27.512 --> 00:42:29.463
of the people we've come across

832
00:42:29.463 --> 00:42:32.560
that would like, fit any of that?

833
00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.001
That is a broad question.

834
00:42:34.001 --> 00:42:37.115
MATT: Not really. You've only really met political figures.

835
00:42:37.115 --> 00:42:40.432
You haven't met anybody from like a

836
00:42:41.347 --> 00:42:45.555
main espionage, you know,

837
00:42:45.555 --> 00:42:48.416
saboteur skill set, that you know of,

838
00:42:48.416 --> 00:42:51.177
and at the same time, most everyone you've interacted with

839
00:42:51.177 --> 00:42:53.910
has had pretty much the same--

840
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:55.518
disposition against the Dynasty.

841
00:42:55.518 --> 00:42:57.501
Sorry, against the Empire.

842
00:42:57.501 --> 00:43:02.496
So nothing jumps out at you, no.

843
00:43:03.866 --> 00:43:05.675
MARISHA: Huh, okay.

844
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:10.273
MATT: Well, anyway, you finish comparing notes for a bit.

845
00:43:12.198 --> 00:43:14.655
Dairon, after finishing this conversation goes,

846
00:43:14.655 --> 00:43:18.425
"All right, well, (sighs) I will go find a place

847
00:43:18.425 --> 00:43:20.986
"to stay for the evening and return tomorrow,

848
00:43:20.986 --> 00:43:23.646
"once you have finished your conversation."

849
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:26.212
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: I'm distracting your wife.

850
00:43:26.212 --> 00:43:28.153
MATT: You did.
MARISHA: Sorry.

851
00:43:28.153 --> 00:43:30.828
Is the blond spy guy,

852
00:43:32.011 --> 00:43:34.127
the blond guy that we saw in the scry,

853
00:43:34.127 --> 00:43:36.264
the blond sply-- the bron scry--

854
00:43:36.264 --> 00:43:38.183
SAM: Lebron Spy Guy.

855
00:43:38.183 --> 00:43:40.945
MATT: Lebron Sky Guy. Scry Guy.

856
00:43:40.945 --> 00:43:42.498
Can't even say it.

857
00:43:42.498 --> 00:43:44.306
What about him?

858
00:43:44.306 --> 00:43:49.272
MARISHA: I mention him in the smuggling of the--

859
00:43:50.223 --> 00:43:51.770
of the stuff, and Obann,

860
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:56.770
and ask if she's seen any of-- knows of that description.

861
00:43:57.336 --> 00:43:59.377
LIAM: Heard of a blond fry guy.
MARISHA: Yeah.

862
00:43:59.377 --> 00:44:01.093
MATT: "I don't know this individual

863
00:44:01.093 --> 00:44:03.043
from how you describe it, but--"

864
00:44:03.043 --> 00:44:04.864
and Dairon begins to pull out a little book

865
00:44:04.864 --> 00:44:06.678
and starts writing notes in as well and goes,

866
00:44:06.678 --> 00:44:11.670
"Tell me everything you know about this individual."

867
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.745
SAM: That's it.
MARISHA: He's blond.

868
00:44:13.745 --> 00:44:15.626
LAURA: Zemnian.
MARISHA: Zemnian accent.

869
00:44:15.626 --> 00:44:17.340
SAM: His last name is Fryguy.

870
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.782
(laughter)

871
00:44:19.782 --> 00:44:22.463
LIAM: F-R-E-I-G-U-Y.

872
00:44:22.463 --> 00:44:24.237
LAURA: Doesn't he wear, no.

873
00:44:24.237 --> 00:44:28.004
MARISHA: He was in the room with King Dwendal.

874
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:29.783
MATT: "So--"

875
00:44:29.783 --> 00:44:30.957
LAURA: But he might have been hidden.

876
00:44:30.957 --> 00:44:34.990
MARISHA: But he might have been like a demon in disguise.

877
00:44:36.636 --> 00:44:39.159
MATT: "That is extremely worrying, but very important

878
00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:42.259
"to know that this individual might have access

879
00:44:42.259 --> 00:44:44.370
"to such powerful figures."

880
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.223
MARISHA: Honestly, it's been super hard trying to figure out

881
00:44:46.223 --> 00:44:49.306
who's just a traitor and who's a demon.

882
00:44:50.499 --> 00:44:51.568
MATT: "(sighs)

883
00:44:51.568 --> 00:44:53.477
"How about this?

884
00:44:57.611 --> 00:45:00.486
"When all of this-- whatever you're heading towards,

885
00:45:00.486 --> 00:45:03.715
"is finished, hopefully soon,

886
00:45:03.715 --> 00:45:06.833
"and you come back here, if all goes well,

887
00:45:06.833 --> 00:45:08.196
"I should still be here.

888
00:45:08.196 --> 00:45:13.194
"Or if not, returned, at least hopefully safely.

889
00:45:13.194 --> 00:45:16.580
"We could probably use you and all your friends' help

890
00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:21.580
"back in the Empire to find out whoever this individual is.

891
00:45:22.108 --> 00:45:25.221
"If this is an individual of some repute,

892
00:45:25.221 --> 00:45:28.454
"nobility, political involvement, it shouldn't be

893
00:45:28.454 --> 00:45:33.454
"too hard to find, whether through illusory recreations

894
00:45:34.394 --> 00:45:37.514
"of their description, to find out who this individual is,

895
00:45:37.514 --> 00:45:40.514
"and that is a strong thread, if any."

896
00:45:43.477 --> 00:45:45.771
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, you know, we'll check our schedule.

897
00:45:45.771 --> 00:45:47.968
SAM: (laughing)

898
00:45:47.968 --> 00:45:51.326
MATT: "See if you can squeeze me in, I understand."

899
00:45:51.326 --> 00:45:53.720
MARISHA: That's not what I mean, it's a little--

900
00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.397
yeah, I'll process that information.

901
00:45:56.397 --> 00:45:59.246
MATT: "All right, just, when you return,

902
00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:01.931
"and you have the time to do so, have the blue one

903
00:46:01.931 --> 00:46:05.934
"let me know, and we'll reconvene on the other side."

904
00:46:05.934 --> 00:46:08.779
MARISHA: Okay-- you know, her name's Jester.

905
00:46:08.779 --> 00:46:12.448
You were in a room with her for like 45 minutes.

906
00:46:12.448 --> 00:46:17.440
I will introduce you to the rest of the team in the morning.

907
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.762
Crash here tonight and we'll talk

908
00:46:20.762 --> 00:46:25.762
about you being the new ward of the Xhorhaus, okay?

909
00:46:26.063 --> 00:46:29.112
MATT: "Fair enough."
MARISHA: And learn everyone's names,

910
00:46:29.112 --> 00:46:32.995
because Fjord will appreciate that.

911
00:46:32.995 --> 00:46:37.492
MATT: "Jester, Fjord, Nott, Caleb,

912
00:46:37.492 --> 00:46:41.992
Yasha, Mollymauk,

913
00:46:43.637 --> 00:46:48.296
"and I believe that's it."

914
00:46:48.296 --> 00:46:50.063
MARISHA: Caduceus.

915
00:46:51.494 --> 00:46:55.324
MATT: "I do not believe I have met this Caduceus."

916
00:46:55.324 --> 00:46:58.183
MARISHA: Also, apparently you're just an asshole.

917
00:47:01.035 --> 00:47:02.793
MATT: "I'm not arguing.

918
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:09.958
"I'm going to go use the hot tub,"

919
00:47:09.958 --> 00:47:11.458
and Dairon leaves.

920
00:47:12.921 --> 00:47:16.447
TALIESIN: Best purchase we've ever made,
that hot tub.

921
00:47:16.447 --> 00:47:18.218
Paid for itself already.

922
00:47:18.218 --> 00:47:20.091
LIAM: Walking away, it's a useful tool.

923
00:47:20.091 --> 00:47:22.457
(laughter)

924
00:47:22.457 --> 00:47:24.087
MARISHA: Okay.

925
00:47:24.087 --> 00:47:25.695
I go to bed.

926
00:47:27.979 --> 00:47:28.943
MATT: All right.

927
00:47:28.943 --> 00:47:30.122
MARISHA: I guess, fuck.

928
00:47:30.122 --> 00:47:31.338
LAURA: How'd it go, how'd it go?

929
00:47:31.338 --> 00:47:32.508
What happened?

930
00:47:32.508 --> 00:47:34.191
MARISHA: Oh I, um--

931
00:47:37.031 --> 00:47:39.197
It went-- it went good.

932
00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.238
Apparently a bunch of, um--

933
00:47:45.689 --> 00:47:48.528
Empire soldiers died.

934
00:47:48.528 --> 00:47:50.786
LAURA: I know, I was listening at the door, I heard.

935
00:47:50.786 --> 00:47:52.019
MARISHA: Yeah.

936
00:47:53.063 --> 00:47:56.752
Also Hupperdook is now mobilizing, and skyships.

937
00:47:56.752 --> 00:47:59.118
LAURA: Yeah, I wonder if Kiri's with them.

938
00:47:59.118 --> 00:48:00.957
Probably not.

939
00:48:00.957 --> 00:48:02.832
MARISHA: Oh, god.

940
00:48:08.527 --> 00:48:11.410
I think this war is about to get real bad.

941
00:48:12.633 --> 00:48:14.501
LAURA: Yeah.

942
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:16.418
MARISHA: Anyway, I don't know.

943
00:48:20.772 --> 00:48:24.489
I'm curious to hear what the others say in the morning.

944
00:48:24.489 --> 00:48:29.239
LAURA: Do you think that she's going to
sleep in Yasha's room?

945
00:48:31.556 --> 00:48:36.415
MARISHA: Well, I guess we'll see if she likes sunflowers.

946
00:48:37.545 --> 00:48:38.995
LAURA: Yeah.

947
00:48:40.906 --> 00:48:43.224
MARISHA: She can always take my bed if she wants

948
00:48:43.224 --> 00:48:44.796
while I'm not here.

949
00:48:44.796 --> 00:48:47.096
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh, right.

950
00:48:48.006 --> 00:48:50.633
MARISHA: Yeah, when I'm not here, you know.

951
00:48:50.633 --> 00:48:53.541
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, totally.

952
00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:55.354
TRAVIS: (laughs)

953
00:48:55.354 --> 00:48:58.146
MARISHA: Okay, my head hurts, I'm going to go lay down.

954
00:48:58.146 --> 00:49:00.479
MATT: (chuckling)

955
00:49:01.986 --> 00:49:03.730
All righty, so.

956
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:05.609
Any other business before the evening is closed?

957
00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.330
You guys go to the next morning?

958
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:11.266
You come to consciousness in the Xhorhaus in Rosohna,

959
00:49:11.266 --> 00:49:15.266
the new day, though still night out, greets you.

960
00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:18.283
As you all begin to rouse from your slumber

961
00:49:18.283 --> 00:49:22.144
and regather for what the next endeavor,

962
00:49:22.144 --> 00:49:25.963
the next path that lies before you and you discuss this,

963
00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:28.743
as you all have your breakfast,

964
00:49:28.743 --> 00:49:30.778
largely prepared by Caduceus, probably.

965
00:49:30.778 --> 00:49:35.778
MARISHA: I try to get down early-ish,
definitely before Dairon,

966
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.235
so I can start introducing people to the

967
00:49:41.706 --> 00:49:44.951
idea that she stayed the night and might be staying here.

968
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:46.455
MATT: All right.

969
00:49:46.455 --> 00:49:48.879
As everyone else is gathered around for food,

970
00:49:48.879 --> 00:49:51.119
Dairon has not come down yet.

971
00:49:52.044 --> 00:49:53.393
TALIESIN: I'm just kind of curious.

972
00:49:53.393 --> 00:49:54.730
How high would I have to roll to notice

973
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:57.945
that there's possibly somebody in the house?

974
00:49:57.945 --> 00:50:00.088
MATT: Roll a perception check.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

975
00:50:00.088 --> 00:50:01.457
TRAVIS: Roll a doorbell check.

976
00:50:01.457 --> 00:50:02.290
TALIESIN: 20.

977
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:03.700
MATT: 20?

978
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.019
TALIESIN: I'm okay if no.

979
00:50:06.019 --> 00:50:09.139
MATT: I would say no, because of Dairon's skill set.

980
00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:10.097
TALIESIN: Done.

981
00:50:10.097 --> 00:50:11.802
MATT: She's too good at what she does,

982
00:50:11.802 --> 00:50:16.195
so you do not pick up any signs of Dairon's arrival.

983
00:50:16.195 --> 00:50:18.870
MARISHA: Caduceus, what are you making this morning?

984
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.078
TALIESIN: Oh, I was going to make like a scramble,

985
00:50:21.078 --> 00:50:22.420
it's going to be good.

986
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.334
MARISHA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

987
00:50:23.334 --> 00:50:25.400
MARISHA: What's in the-- do we have bacon?

988
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.923
TALIESIN: We don't have bacon, because I don't

989
00:50:27.923 --> 00:50:29.597
actually usually buy--

990
00:50:29.597 --> 00:50:30.741
MARISHA: Do we have coffee?

991
00:50:30.741 --> 00:50:31.773
TALIESIN: We do have coffee.

992
00:50:31.773 --> 00:50:32.913
MARISHA: Okay.

993
00:50:32.913 --> 00:50:33.882
Okay.

994
00:50:33.882 --> 00:50:36.146
SAM: I have some bacon in my pocket, if you want it.

995
00:50:36.146 --> 00:50:37.613
MARISHA: You still have some of that?

996
00:50:37.613 --> 00:50:39.784
SAM: I just always keep a little in there, just in case.

997
00:50:39.784 --> 00:50:41.220
TALIESIN: You want me to cook the pocket bacon?

998
00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:44.240
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just heat it up, though.

999
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.092
TALIESIN: I'll heat it up, that's fine.

1000
00:50:45.092 --> 00:50:46.965
We're just going to use a separate pan, because this is--

1001
00:50:46.965 --> 00:50:49.162
MARISHA: You might want to make, just, you know,

1002
00:50:49.162 --> 00:50:53.987
a little extra, like one serving extra?

1003
00:50:53.987 --> 00:50:55.287
TALIESIN: Are you feeling peckish?

1004
00:50:55.287 --> 00:50:58.081
Are you feeling like you really want to like--

1005
00:50:58.081 --> 00:51:00.397
I mean, this is not very carby, but I can like--

1006
00:51:00.397 --> 00:51:02.573
MARISHA: Yeah, no, we have a guest.

1007
00:51:02.573 --> 00:51:07.148
We have-- not a guest, we have a person here.

1008
00:51:07.148 --> 00:51:10.527
SAM: Did you bone someone last night?
MARISHA: No.

1009
00:51:10.527 --> 00:51:14.063
TALIESIN: Did you kidnap somebody and put them in--

1010
00:51:14.063 --> 00:51:16.511
we have a cell, don't we?

1011
00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:17.495
We have a cell, right?

1012
00:51:17.495 --> 00:51:19.766
SAM: I don't think we do.
LAURA: I don't think we do.

1013
00:51:19.766 --> 00:51:22.176
SAM: We have a war room. That's all we have.

1014
00:51:22.176 --> 00:51:25.724
MARISHA: Oh, fuck, I forgot about that war room.

1015
00:51:25.724 --> 00:51:27.292
LIAM: Who is this guest?

1016
00:51:27.292 --> 00:51:29.123
TALIESIN: Good question.

1017
00:51:29.123 --> 00:51:31.189
MARISHA: You all remember Dairon?

1018
00:51:31.189 --> 00:51:32.388
TALIESIN: Nope.
MARISHA: Remember Dairon?

1019
00:51:32.388 --> 00:51:33.279
SAM: Sure.
LIAM: Of course.

1020
00:51:33.279 --> 00:51:35.280
LAURA: I remember her, them.

1021
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.495
LIAM: Dairon is here.

1022
00:51:36.495 --> 00:51:38.539
TALIESIN: Who?

1023
00:51:38.539 --> 00:51:40.405
MARISHA: My mentor.
SAM: Did you meet Dairon?

1024
00:51:40.405 --> 00:51:42.555
MARISHA: My mentor, Dairon.

1025
00:51:42.555 --> 00:51:43.388
TALIESIN: No idea.

1026
00:51:43.388 --> 00:51:45.461
MARISHA: You might've briefly run into--

1027
00:51:45.461 --> 00:51:47.646
SAM: After the little fight at the bar--

1028
00:51:47.646 --> 00:51:49.904
LAURA: I don't think Caduceus ever--

1029
00:51:49.904 --> 00:51:50.889
TALIESIN: Ah.

1030
00:51:50.889 --> 00:51:52.496
LAURA: Oh, yes.

1031
00:51:52.496 --> 00:51:54.504
TALIESIN: Wait.
LAURA: Wait.

1032
00:51:54.504 --> 00:51:55.808
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't remember.

1033
00:51:55.808 --> 00:51:58.532
MARISHA: I don't know if you participated in that fight.

1034
00:51:58.532 --> 00:51:59.832
I don't know.

1035
00:51:59.832 --> 00:52:02.841
LIAM: How did she find us here?

1036
00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:07.841
MARISHA: She's a spy, and she's good at finding people.

1037
00:52:11.076 --> 00:52:13.317
LIAM: Is there anything more to this story?

1038
00:52:14.784 --> 00:52:16.533
MARISHA: She's, um--

1039
00:52:18.676 --> 00:52:22.426
She's here, and our--

1040
00:52:22.426 --> 00:52:24.876
it seems our goals

1041
00:52:24.876 --> 00:52:28.042
and motivations

1042
00:52:28.917 --> 00:52:30.267
have aligned.

1043
00:52:30.267 --> 00:52:31.645
SAM: Oh, good, that's good.

1044
00:52:31.645 --> 00:52:32.924
TRAVIS: She's just a good spy?

1045
00:52:32.924 --> 00:52:34.236
Like, we've been out in the desert

1046
00:52:34.236 --> 00:52:35.941
for the last few fucking days.

1047
00:52:35.941 --> 00:52:37.254
How'd she track us here?

1048
00:52:37.254 --> 00:52:39.237
MARISHA: Okay.

1049
00:52:39.237 --> 00:52:40.511
W-we called her.

1050
00:52:40.511 --> 00:52:41.508
SAM: Oh.

1051
00:52:41.508 --> 00:52:42.824
TRAVIS: Who called her?

1052
00:52:42.824 --> 00:52:45.249
LAURA: Oh, you know, me and Beau.

1053
00:52:45.249 --> 00:52:47.095
TALIESIN: What? Oh, what?

1054
00:52:47.095 --> 00:52:49.497
SAM: That's fine, I mean, she's your friend, right?

1055
00:52:49.497 --> 00:52:51.975
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Pretty good spy.

1056
00:52:51.975 --> 00:52:53.086
MARISHA: Yeah.

1057
00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:54.568
TRAVIS: Isn't this the one you were like oh,

1058
00:52:54.568 --> 00:52:56.218
"Dairon, she's going to kick my ass,

1059
00:52:56.218 --> 00:52:58.359
they're going to kick my ass if they find me."

1060
00:52:58.359 --> 00:52:59.952
I mean, this is the same Dairon,

1061
00:52:59.952 --> 00:53:03.863
and you called her?
MARISHA: Yes, it is the same Dairon.

1062
00:53:03.863 --> 00:53:07.785
It appears she's not going to kick my ass.

1063
00:53:07.785 --> 00:53:09.066
SAM: Great.

1064
00:53:09.066 --> 00:53:10.658
TALIESIN: Already an improvement.

1065
00:53:10.658 --> 00:53:14.647
MARISHA: Here doing the same type of stealth

1066
00:53:14.647 --> 00:53:19.022
and espionage.

1067
00:53:20.046 --> 00:53:21.671
Intrigue.

1068
00:53:21.671 --> 00:53:23.364
LAURA: She's actually here at the house,

1069
00:53:23.364 --> 00:53:26.861
and she's probably under the table or something.

1070
00:53:26.861 --> 00:53:28.343
TALIESIN: I'm going to look under the table.

1071
00:53:28.343 --> 00:53:29.700
MATT: Make a perception check.

1072
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.182
TALIESIN: Awesome.

1073
00:53:31.182 --> 00:53:32.698
LAURA: I look at, like, cabinets.

1074
00:53:32.698 --> 00:53:35.400
Maybe she disguised herself as a cabinet.

1075
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.491
MATT: Okay.

1076
00:53:36.491 --> 00:53:38.864
Make a perception check, Jester.
LIAM: I rolled a one.

1077
00:53:38.864 --> 00:53:40.833
MATT: You do not see Dairon beneath the table.

1078
00:53:40.833 --> 00:53:43.133
LAURA: Natural 20!

1079
00:53:43.133 --> 00:53:44.354
MATT: (laughs)

1080
00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:47.832
You go to the cabinet and inspect it.

1081
00:53:47.832 --> 00:53:49.171
It's definitely a cabinet, but out of

1082
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:52.031
the corner of your eye-- I trust you--

1083
00:53:52.031 --> 00:53:54.058
you do see up at the top of the stairs

1084
00:53:54.058 --> 00:53:57.942
leading down to the upper floor, you do see Dairon crouched

1085
00:53:57.942 --> 00:54:00.235
and she's listening in to the conversation.

1086
00:54:00.235 --> 00:54:01.467
TALIESIN: Wow.

1087
00:54:01.467 --> 00:54:03.500
Got all the way up there from here, they're really good.

1088
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.400
That's good.

1089
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.640
LIAM: What is she doing here?

1090
00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.640
What is she after, spy things, what?

1091
00:54:12.216 --> 00:54:14.450
SAM: Laura can't figure out how to refocus it

1092
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:18.118
since she focused the camera to her dice.
LAURA: Oh no, what do I do?

1093
00:54:18.118 --> 00:54:20.328
SAM: Sit in the middle, sit in the middle.

1094
00:54:20.328 --> 00:54:23.054
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah make it-- it'll auto-focus.

1095
00:54:23.054 --> 00:54:26.181
SAM: Go in the middle. Yeah, there.
MARISHA: It'll auto-focus.

1096
00:54:26.181 --> 00:54:28.258
Oh, you're good.

1097
00:54:28.258 --> 00:54:31.091
(laughter)

1098
00:54:31.091 --> 00:54:31.924
SAM: You're going to be out of focus

1099
00:54:31.924 --> 00:54:33.173
for the next three hours.
TRAVIS: It's okay, I didn't spend fucking

1100
00:54:33.173 --> 00:54:36.501
half an hour setting this shit up.
LAURA: I'm sorry!

1101
00:54:36.501 --> 00:54:38.342
MARISHA: There it goes, see?
MATT: There we go, we're good.

1102
00:54:38.342 --> 00:54:39.900
LAURA: Yay!

1103
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.832
LIAM: Are we bringing her with us?

1104
00:54:41.832 --> 00:54:43.096
I don't understand.

1105
00:54:43.096 --> 00:54:47.099
MARISHA: No, she's here investigating and attempting to find

1106
00:54:47.099 --> 00:54:50.734
a potential turncoat or double agent,

1107
00:54:50.734 --> 00:54:55.701
who she thinks might be responsible

1108
00:54:55.701 --> 00:54:59.476
for potentially triggering this whole war to begin with.

1109
00:54:59.476 --> 00:55:04.159
That maybe someone here in the Dynasty has--

1110
00:55:04.159 --> 00:55:05.850
organized,

1111
00:55:06.734 --> 00:55:10.248
in association with the Cerberus Assembly,

1112
00:55:10.248 --> 00:55:14.031
stealing the fragments of possibility.

1113
00:55:14.031 --> 00:55:14.925
The beacons.

1114
00:55:14.925 --> 00:55:15.867
TRAVIS: I'm fucking down with that,

1115
00:55:15.867 --> 00:55:17.233
100%.
SAM: That sounds great.

1116
00:55:17.233 --> 00:55:20.400
TALIESIN: That's actually really good.
SAM: That's exactly what we want.

1117
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.486
MARISHA: Yeah?

1118
00:55:22.486 --> 00:55:24.836
SAM: Give her whatever she needs to accomplish that.

1119
00:55:24.836 --> 00:55:27.746
TALIESIN: (shouting) Do you need breakfast? Hey.

1120
00:55:27.746 --> 00:55:29.032
LIAM: Who are you yelling at?

1121
00:55:29.032 --> 00:55:30.781
LAURA: Dairon, come on down.

1122
00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:33.013
MATT: Dairon descends from the stairs and joins the chamber

1123
00:55:33.013 --> 00:55:34.048
with everybody.

1124
00:55:34.048 --> 00:55:35.325
TALIESIN: It's vegan.

1125
00:55:35.325 --> 00:55:38.939
And there's bacon, pocket bacon, it's warm.

1126
00:55:38.939 --> 00:55:41.575
MARISHA: Did I describe that aptly enough?

1127
00:55:41.575 --> 00:55:45.905
MATT: "I think that was as close as could be done concisely.

1128
00:55:45.905 --> 00:55:47.501
"Hello everyone.

1129
00:55:47.501 --> 00:55:48.410
"Good to see you all again."

1130
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:49.948
SAM: Hi, there.

1131
00:55:49.948 --> 00:55:51.552
TALIESIN: Hi.

1132
00:55:51.552 --> 00:55:54.098
MATT: "Pleasure."
TALIESIN: Pleasure.

1133
00:55:54.098 --> 00:55:59.098
MARISHA: I don't want my comrade to die

1134
00:55:59.168 --> 00:56:02.120
out here without any assistance.

1135
00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.634
Dairon is aware and I have made things very clear

1136
00:56:04.634 --> 00:56:08.494
that I want to make sure that we're not compromised

1137
00:56:08.494 --> 00:56:10.919
in any way by having some sort of

1138
00:56:10.919 --> 00:56:14.336
outside connection that can be uncovered.

1139
00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:17.202
But you're good at not being found.

1140
00:56:17.202 --> 00:56:19.921
MATT: "That is very specifically what I am good at."

1141
00:56:21.579 --> 00:56:26.563
MARISHA: Dairon is requesting that maybe they become

1142
00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:30.913
the ward of the the Xhorhaus?

1143
00:56:30.913 --> 00:56:31.913
TALIESIN: Ward?

1144
00:56:31.913 --> 00:56:33.326
MARISHA: Keeper.

1145
00:56:33.326 --> 00:56:34.918
TALIESIN: Keeper.

1146
00:56:34.918 --> 00:56:37.491
SAM: Like a maid?

1147
00:56:37.491 --> 00:56:38.912
TALIESIN: Butler.

1148
00:56:38.912 --> 00:56:40.777
LAURA: Like the house manager, you know.

1149
00:56:40.777 --> 00:56:41.893
TALIESIN: Manager.

1150
00:56:41.893 --> 00:56:45.259
MATT: Loudly cracks her knuckles as you say "maid."

1151
00:56:45.259 --> 00:56:47.512
TRAVIS: Can you get some groceries and like,

1152
00:56:47.512 --> 00:56:50.338
the beds made and stuff?

1153
00:56:50.338 --> 00:56:53.805
SAM: Yeah, Jester, you grew up with house servants, right?

1154
00:56:53.805 --> 00:56:57.002
You would know how to command one around the house.

1155
00:56:57.002 --> 00:56:59.830
LAURA: You don't-- well, you be nice,

1156
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:02.410
they are people that are at the house that are helping.

1157
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:04.869
SAM: I mean, we learn their names or whatever, but--

1158
00:57:04.869 --> 00:57:06.098
LAURA: Nott.

1159
00:57:06.098 --> 00:57:08.431
MARISHA: Your Scanlan is showing.
TALIESIN: I know.

1160
00:57:08.431 --> 00:57:09.470
(laughter)

1161
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:11.089
SAM: My Sam Riegel is showing.

1162
00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:13.654
(laughter)

1163
00:57:13.654 --> 00:57:15.071
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

1164
00:57:17.442 --> 00:57:19.690
LIAM: You don't mean to just stay in this home, though,

1165
00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:21.901
you have business here in Rosohna?

1166
00:57:21.901 --> 00:57:23.291
MATT: "I have quite a bit of business,

1167
00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:27.627
"but I need to have a place to stay that is moderately safe,

1168
00:57:27.627 --> 00:57:29.477
"perhaps easier to get

1169
00:57:29.477 --> 00:57:32.803
closer to the inner circles of this city.

1170
00:57:32.803 --> 00:57:36.634
"And hopefully with such an appointment,

1171
00:57:36.634 --> 00:57:39.684
"would have a reasonable alibi,

1172
00:57:39.684 --> 00:57:43.849
"should anyone inquire my reasoning for being here."

1173
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:45.937
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got a question for you, actually.

1174
00:57:45.937 --> 00:57:48.786
I feel like we're being watched enough as it is,

1175
00:57:48.786 --> 00:57:50.917
maybe even inside this building.

1176
00:57:50.917 --> 00:57:54.217
Do you got any of those skills that can keep people from,

1177
00:57:54.217 --> 00:57:58.131
I don't know, checking in on us without us knowing?

1178
00:57:58.131 --> 00:58:00.804
MATT: "Unfortunately, that is not my bailiwick."

1179
00:58:00.804 --> 00:58:02.038
TRAVIS: Your what?

1180
00:58:02.038 --> 00:58:03.818
MATT: "My specialty.

1181
00:58:03.818 --> 00:58:05.818
"I do not have the skill."

1182
00:58:07.942 --> 00:58:10.060
LAURA: If somebody were to ask you, you know,

1183
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.487
"Where did you come from? Why did they hire you?"

1184
00:58:12.487 --> 00:58:14.425
What will you say?

1185
00:58:14.425 --> 00:58:17.128
MATT: "I will say that I was originally raised

1186
00:58:17.128 --> 00:58:19.985
"here on the outskirts of Rosohna,

1187
00:58:19.985 --> 00:58:24.835
"and I, you know, am a skilled

1188
00:58:24.835 --> 00:58:27.326
keeper of homes,

1189
00:58:27.326 --> 00:58:30.987
"and we had met not but a week beforehand,

1190
00:58:30.987 --> 00:58:34.545
"myself needing work, and you being too busy to stay,

1191
00:58:34.545 --> 00:58:36.978
"hired me to take care of it in your stead

00:58:36.978 --> 00:58:39.178
"while you are off handling whatever business

1193
00:58:39.178 --> 00:58:40.906
"you're handling, of which did I not ask,

1194
00:58:40.906 --> 00:58:44.073
"as a professional keeper of your home."

1195
00:58:45.124 --> 00:58:47.750
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, it makes sense if we're sending

1196
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:52.192
Yeza to safety, that we hired security

1197
00:58:52.192 --> 00:58:55.499
to just watch over the place in his stead.

1198
00:58:55.499 --> 00:58:57.535
TALIESIN: Water the plants.
MARISHA: Water the plants.

1199
00:58:57.535 --> 00:58:59.211
LIAM: That seems plausible to me.

1200
00:58:59.211 --> 00:59:00.552
MARISHA: Okay.

1201
00:59:02.393 --> 00:59:03.226
TRAVIS: Sure.

1202
00:59:03.226 --> 00:59:05.861
LIAM: I'm sorry, I don't mean to be presumptuous.

1203
00:59:05.861 --> 00:59:07.217
May I?

1204
00:59:07.217 --> 00:59:10.818
MARISHA: You may speak to Dairon, is that what you mean?

1205
00:59:10.818 --> 00:59:11.651
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

1206
00:59:11.651 --> 00:59:14.134
MARISHA: Yes, please, address Dairon.

1207
00:59:15.152 --> 00:59:17.452
LIAM: Everything you're doing here is in coordination

1208
00:59:17.452 --> 00:59:19.321
with the Cobalt Soul.

1209
00:59:19.321 --> 00:59:20.246
MATT: "Yes."

1210
00:59:20.246 --> 00:59:22.917
LIAM: They know everything you're doing.

1211
00:59:22.917 --> 00:59:25.475
MATT: "There are occasional check-ins, yes."

1212
00:59:25.475 --> 00:59:28.627
LIAM: You are plugged in to a network.

1213
00:59:28.627 --> 00:59:33.183
MATT: "Well, they have an individual who reaches out to me

1214
00:59:33.183 --> 00:59:36.405
"in very much the same way that your Jester has.

1215
00:59:36.405 --> 00:59:40.422
"About twice a week, to which we exchange

1216
00:59:40.422 --> 00:59:44.731
"truncated information and updates."

1217
00:59:45.636 --> 00:59:48.885
LIAM: I think we probably have an overlap of goals,

1218
00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:49.787
to an extent.

1219
00:59:49.787 --> 00:59:52.871
If we were to help you in Rosohna to fit in

1220
00:59:52.871 --> 00:59:55.219
and give you shelter here, would you be able to offer

1221
00:59:55.219 --> 00:59:59.294
the same sort of access back in the Empire,

1222
01:00:00.228 --> 01:00:01.196
for us?

1223
01:00:01.196 --> 01:00:03.288
MATT: You see Dairon looks over towards Beauregard

1224
01:00:03.288 --> 01:00:05.505
and looks back to you and goes,

1225
01:00:05.505 --> 01:00:08.142
"If you're forthright in aiding what I am doing,

1226
01:00:08.142 --> 01:00:10.624
"and indeed your goals align with what

1227
01:00:10.624 --> 01:00:12.777
"we are attempting to achieve, and <i>I</i> am

1228
01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:16.827
"attempting to achieve, that is no issue."

1229
01:00:16.827 --> 01:00:19.082
LIAM: You wish to root out corruption
in the Cerberus Assembly,

1230
01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.295
you said so yourself.

1231
01:00:20.295 --> 01:00:21.842
MATT: "Very much so."

1232
01:00:21.842 --> 01:00:23.323
LIAM: We wish to do the same.

1233
01:00:23.323 --> 01:00:24.156
MATT: "Good."

1234
01:00:24.156 --> 01:00:27.205
LIAM: We wish to end the war, as foolish as that seems.

1235
01:00:27.205 --> 01:00:30.449
MATT: "Foolish, yes, but I've seen more foolish ideas

1236
01:00:30.449 --> 01:00:32.032
"still come to pass."

1237
01:00:33.509 --> 01:00:34.871
LIAM: This could work.

1238
01:00:34.871 --> 01:00:38.109
MARISHA: Thank God, my friends like each other.

1239
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:39.334
Oh, fuck.

1240
01:00:40.991 --> 01:00:42.181
(sighs)

1241
01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:44.348
MATT: "Make no mistake, though."

1242
01:00:45.579 --> 01:00:46.894
TALIESIN: Shh.

1243
01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:48.415
That was entirely your fault.

1244
01:00:48.415 --> 01:00:49.248
MATT: Yeah.

1245
01:00:49.248 --> 01:00:52.496
(laughter)

1246
01:00:52.496 --> 01:00:55.489

"you will be tried."

1252
01:01:16.056 --> 01:01:16.896
SAM: Okay.

1253
01:01:16.896 --> 01:01:17.751
TALIESIN: All right, that seems--

1254
01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:19.757
SAM: I think we're okay with that.

1255
01:01:19.757 --> 01:01:20.879
LIAM: Good deal.

1256
01:01:20.879 --> 01:01:21.712
MATT: "Good.

1257
01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:23.768
"You walk an extremely fine and dangerous line

1258
01:01:23.768 --> 01:01:27.051

"This is information I will not be sharing.

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:35.598
"Be careful who you share this with."

1261
01:01:37.529 --> 01:01:39.652
LIAM: I don't think you need to be on guard for this

1262
01:01:39.652 --> 01:01:41.359
as much as you think.

1263
01:01:41.359 --> 01:01:43.816
There is corruption on both sides.

1264
01:01:43.816 --> 01:01:45.112
MATT: "I've lived as long as I have

1265
01:01:45.112 --> 01:01:48.895
"because I trust no one but myself."

1266
01:01:51.683 --> 01:01:54.191
LAURA: Have you lived a really long time?

1267
01:01:54.191 --> 01:01:55.207
TALIESIN: I feel like that would be

1268
01:01:55.207 --> 01:01:57.179
pertinent information, actually.

1269
01:01:57.179 --> 01:02:00.043
MATT: "Towards the end of my second century, yes."

1270
01:02:00.043 --> 01:02:01.532
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1271
01:02:01.532 --> 01:02:02.857
TALIESIN: All right.

1272
01:02:05.466 --> 01:02:08.291
MARISHA: (hesitantly) My friends like each other.

1273
01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.892
(nervous laughter)

1274
01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:12.728
LIAM: The Empire is most of our home.

1275
01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:14.472
MATT: "It is a good home."

1276
01:02:14.472 --> 01:02:15.716
LIAM: Could be better.
MATT: "Yes."

1277
01:02:15.716 --> 01:02:17.614
LIAM: We wish to see it.

1278
01:02:17.614 --> 01:02:19.266
MATT: "As do we."

1279
01:02:19.266 --> 01:02:22.767
LIAM: With this place, with our place here,

1280
01:02:22.767 --> 01:02:27.134
who better poised to have to make a difference?

1281
01:02:28.151 --> 01:02:29.797
MATT: "Good.

1282
01:02:29.797 --> 01:02:33.539
"Then whatever you do, Caleb,

1283
01:02:33.539 --> 01:02:37.294
don't fuck it up."

1284
01:02:37.294 --> 01:02:39.101
LIAM: Well, I don't know if I can promise that.

1285
01:02:39.101 --> 01:02:40.475
SAM: We've already fucked a lot of things up,

1286
01:02:40.475 --> 01:02:42.164
but we'll try our best.

1287
01:02:42.164 --> 01:02:43.323
TALIESIN: Calling card.

1288
01:02:43.323 --> 01:02:45.013
MARISHA: That's a compliment.

1289
01:02:45.013 --> 01:02:46.058
That's like--

1290
01:02:46.058 --> 01:02:47.090
LIAM: That was a joke.

1291
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:49.492
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1292
01:02:50.384 --> 01:02:52.948
I was just trying to--

1293
01:02:52.948 --> 01:02:55.352
SAM: Then it's decided.

1294
01:02:55.352 --> 01:02:56.883
You'll stay in the house while we

1295
01:02:56.883 --> 01:02:59.106
go on a little bit of a journey.

1296
01:02:59.106 --> 01:03:01.171
MARISHA: Let's work on your backstory a little bit more,

1297
01:03:01.171 --> 01:03:06.113
it was a little shaky, just professional criticism.

1298
01:03:07.446 --> 01:03:08.791
MATT: "Very well.

1299
01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:12.078
"Introduce me to at least a handful of individuals

"prowler or an individual who has chosen this home."

1302
01:03:18.778 --> 01:03:22.698
MARISHA: Well, we'll introduce you to Essek,

1303
01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:27.361
and let him know that you're our new housekeeper.

1304
01:03:27.361 --> 01:03:32.361
SAM: And maybe our neighbors, Lord Bilan?

1305
01:03:32.361 --> 01:03:33.790
MARISHA: Yeah, they kind of like us.

1306
01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:35.720
SAM: They hate us.

1307
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.989
LAURA: They don't like the tree.

1308
01:03:36.989 --> 01:03:38.334
I don't know why.

1309
01:03:38.334 --> 01:03:40.236
MATT: "I can't imagine why they would be--"

1310
01:03:40.236 --> 01:03:42.145
TALIESIN: Still taking their vegetables, I'm just saying.

1311
01:03:42.145 --> 01:03:44.530
TRAVIS: Are you good with people like Beauregard is?

1312
01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:48.615
You know, like a real charmer, affable people person?

1313
01:03:48.615 --> 01:03:49.448
MATT: "Hmm!

1314
01:03:50.779 --> 01:03:51.612
"No."

1315
01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:55.397
TRAVIS: Yeah, you'll fit in just fine.

1316
01:03:56.704 --> 01:03:58.055
SAM: That actually makes it more believable.

1317
01:03:58.055 --> 01:03:58.888
MARISHA: It does.

1318
01:03:58.888 --> 01:04:00.023
SAM: That they work for us.

1319
01:04:00.023 --> 01:04:02.388
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

1320
01:04:02.388 --> 01:04:03.479
SAM: All right.

1321
01:04:03.479 --> 01:04:04.790
LAURA: Hey Dairon?

1322
01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:05.822
MATT: "Yes."

1323
01:04:05.822 --> 01:04:09.489
LAURA: Have you ever heard of the Angel of Irons?

1324
01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:13.475
MATT: "I cannot say that I have.

1325
01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.058
"Is it important?"
LAURA: Okay, just checking.

1326
01:04:15.058 --> 01:04:18.171
SAM: It's just a name we heard.

1327
01:04:18.171 --> 01:04:20.589
MATT: "I can send back word and put our researchers on it,

1328
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:22.513
"if you'd like."

1329
01:04:22.513 --> 01:04:24.412
TALIESIN: The Cobalt Soul?

1330
01:04:24.412 --> 01:04:25.245
MARISHA: Yeah.

1331
01:04:25.245 --> 01:04:26.330
MATT: "If there is one thing we are good at,

1332
01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:28.323
"it's acquiring information."

1333
01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:29.702
TALIESIN: Sure.
LAURA: It might be good to have.

1334
01:04:29.702 --> 01:04:30.803
SAM: Let's do that.

1335
01:04:30.803 --> 01:04:32.601
TALIESIN: Anything could help.

1336
01:04:32.601 --> 01:04:34.691
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, if you're going to be sending out

1337
01:04:34.691 --> 01:04:36.753
like a wire or anything, if you also wanted

1338
01:04:36.753 --> 01:04:40.022
to do a little research on the name Uk'otoa, I mean,

1339
01:04:40.022 --> 01:04:41.910
some of us want, you know.

1340
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:43.524
MATT: "All right, Uk'otoa."

1341
01:04:43.524 --> 01:04:45.669
TRAVIS: Anything could be great.

1342
01:04:45.669 --> 01:04:49.056
MATT: "And also the Angel of Irons.

1343
01:04:49.056 --> 01:04:49.889
"I will inquire."

1344
01:04:49.889 --> 01:04:52.570
MARISHA: You also might as well throw in the Crawling King.

1345
01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:53.521
TRAVIS: Yeah, about that--

1346
01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:55.014
MATT: "I know about the Crawling King."

1347
01:04:55.014 --> 01:04:55.847
MARISHA: Well.

1348
01:04:55.847 --> 01:04:56.680
TALIESIN: What was the other one?

1349
01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:01.656
MARISHA: I mean, we do too, I was just, the Laughing Hand?

1350
01:05:01.656 --> 01:05:04.227
LIAM: One of the main characters in the lore and religion

1351
01:05:04.227 --> 01:05:06.431
of the realm in which we live.

1352
01:05:06.431 --> 01:05:08.171
SAM: Oh yeah.

1353
01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:11.167
MATT: "The Laughing Hand I will also look into."

1354
01:05:11.167 --> 01:05:12.737
SAM: This is great.

1355
01:05:12.737 --> 01:05:14.252
MARISHA: Yeah, I had access to this,

1356
01:05:14.252 --> 01:05:15.666
but we've just been so connected,

1357
01:05:15.666 --> 01:05:16.957
and I didn't want to be found out,

1358
01:05:16.957 --> 01:05:19.538
because I thought that they'd be pissed.

1359
01:05:19.538 --> 01:05:20.816
MATT: "Well, I'm still very angry with the fact

1360
01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:24.261
"that you've gone ahead and taken such bold moves

"and instead try and, what is the adage?

1365
01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:43.348
"Make lemonade out of sour fruit?"

1366
01:05:43.348 --> 01:05:44.963
TALIESIN: This is precisely the sort of positive attitude

1367
01:05:44.963 --> 01:05:47.791
I've been saying everybody should be having.

1368
01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:49.756
This is what I've been waiting for.

1369
01:05:49.756 --> 01:05:51.415
This is great.

1370
01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:54.334
SAM: Honestly, Beauregard, this is how everyone treats you

1371
01:05:54.334 --> 01:05:58.384
and talks to you, so this is not news to us.

1372
01:05:58.384 --> 01:06:02.682
MARISHA: It is a, yes, it is a mirror.

1373
01:06:02.682 --> 01:06:05.034
(laughter)

1374
01:06:05.034 --> 01:06:07.384
MATT: "I appreciate your trust in me.

1375
01:06:09.013 --> 01:06:10.330
"Be careful."

1376
01:06:12.228 --> 01:06:13.800
TRAVIS: Yeah, same to you.

1377
01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.684
Are we going to be sticking around here a few days,

1378
01:06:15.684 --> 01:06:18.091
or are we going to find this fucking kiln?

1379
01:06:18.091 --> 01:06:20.196
LAURA: We're going to Nicodranas, I thought.

1380
01:06:20.196 --> 01:06:21.743
LIAM: Yeah, I was about to--
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, that's right.

1381
01:06:21.743 --> 01:06:24.561
LIAM: About to ask, are we pushing back our departure time

1382
01:06:24.561 --> 01:06:28.746
so that we can plant the seeds of our new security guard

1383
01:06:28.746 --> 01:06:29.579
here at the house?
SAM: We can probably

1384
01:06:29.579 --> 01:06:32.055
just take an hour or so

1385
01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:37.055
to mention it to Essek and our neighbors?

1386
01:06:37.249 --> 01:06:39.966
TALIESIN: They were going to, I think, give us a little bit

1387
01:06:39.966 --> 01:06:41.067
of help on the way out.

1388
01:06:41.067 --> 01:06:42.392
MARISHA: We also don't all have to necessarily

1389
01:06:42.392 --> 01:06:43.843
have to go to Nicodranas.

1390
01:06:43.843 --> 01:06:45.010
SAM: That's true.

1391
01:06:46.981 --> 01:06:48.189
MARISHA: What?
TRAVIS: Why?

1392
01:06:48.189 --> 01:06:49.039
MARISHA: Huh?

1393
01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:50.893
MATT: You can see in the back of the room.

1394
01:06:50.893 --> 01:06:55.321
You see Yeza kind of, "Oh, okay."

1395
01:06:55.321 --> 01:06:56.154
MARISHA: What?

1396
01:06:56.154 --> 01:06:57.592
SAM: No, you're going.

1397
01:06:57.592 --> 01:06:59.384
We're going.

1398
01:07:00.338 --> 01:07:02.237
MATT: "Right."
SAM: Yeah.

1399
01:07:02.237 --> 01:07:03.751
MARISHA: What?

1400
01:07:03.751 --> 01:07:05.325
MATT: "I just heard we weren't going to Nicodranas."

1401
01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:09.480
SAM: No, she said not <i>all</i> of us have to go to Nicodranas.

1402
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.313
MATT: "Okay."
SAM: We're going to go.

1403
01:07:10.313 --> 01:07:11.676
We're going to go, we're going to go.

1404
01:07:11.676 --> 01:07:13.484
MARISHA: Does Yeza not want to go to Nicodranas?

1405
01:07:13.484 --> 01:07:14.767
Insight check?

1406
01:07:14.767 --> 01:07:16.765
MATT: Make an insight check.

1407
01:07:19.949 --> 01:07:21.082
TALIESIN: Hey.

1408
01:07:21.082 --> 01:07:23.156
MATT: No, Yeza very much wants to go.

1409
01:07:23.156 --> 01:07:23.989
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

1410
01:07:23.989 --> 01:07:26.516
MATT: Yeza seemed briefly heartbroken

1411
01:07:26.516 --> 01:07:29.564
at the possibility of not going.

1412
01:07:29.564 --> 01:07:30.424
MARISHA: Oh.

1413
01:07:30.424 --> 01:07:32.584
MATT: Knowing that perhaps Luc--

1414
01:07:32.584 --> 01:07:36.096
TALIESIN: To be fair, it is the Orlando of Exandria.

1415
01:07:36.096 --> 01:07:37.246
(laughter)

1416
01:07:37.246 --> 01:07:40.538
SAM, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: ♪ Orlando ♪

1417
01:07:40.538 --> 01:07:41.887
(laughter)

1418
01:07:41.887 --> 01:07:43.887
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: Bless you all.

1419
01:07:43.887 --> 01:07:45.388
MATT: It is.

1420
01:07:45.388 --> 01:07:47.765
And Dalen's Closet is the Boca Raton.

1421
01:07:47.765 --> 01:07:50.773
(laughter)

1422
01:07:50.773 --> 01:07:52.481
All right, so yeah, if you guys would like to--

1423
01:07:52.481 --> 01:07:55.037
LAURA: I pass some of my food under the table to Nugget.

1424
01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:57.178
(laughter)

1425
01:07:57.178 --> 01:08:01.611
SAM: Should we just send a message to Essek or something,

1426
01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:03.161
and then skedaddle?

1427
01:08:03.161 --> 01:08:05.192
TALIESIN: I would love to grab a few supplies

1428
01:08:05.192 --> 01:08:06.515
so we could have--
SAM: Supplies?

1429
01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:08.265
TALIESIN: Like a map of where we're going,

1430
01:08:08.265 --> 01:08:09.969
if we can get some maps and maybe some--

1431
01:08:09.969 --> 01:08:11.607
SAM: We're going to Nicodranas.

1432
01:08:11.607 --> 01:08:12.910
TALIESIN: Well, you're going to Nicodranas.

1433
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:15.103
SAM: Oh, okay, okay.

1434
01:08:15.103 --> 01:08:16.291
TALIESIN: Some of us could stick up here

1435
01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:18.436
and just get a few things for our trip.

1436
01:08:18.436 --> 01:08:19.436
SAM: All right.

1437
01:08:22.394 --> 01:08:23.495
SAM: Well then--
MARISHA: Is that weird?

1438
01:08:23.495 --> 01:08:27.447
SAM: Me and Caleb and I guess Jester can go to Nicodranas,

1439
01:08:27.447 --> 01:08:30.603
and we'll see you back tomorrow?

1440
01:08:30.603 --> 01:08:31.436
MARISHA: Fjord?

1441
01:08:33.639 --> 01:08:34.472
TRAVIS: Yes?

1442
01:08:36.342 --> 01:08:37.617
MARISHA: Do you want to go to Nicodranas,

1443
01:08:37.617 --> 01:08:39.583
or you want to stay?

1444
01:08:39.583 --> 01:08:40.654
LAURA: Nicodranas?

1445
01:08:40.654 --> 01:08:42.089
TRAVIS: Do I want to?

1446
01:08:42.089 --> 01:08:43.922
SAM: It's near the water.

1447
01:08:45.315 --> 01:08:47.154
LAURA: Only if you want to.

1448
01:08:47.154 --> 01:08:50.223
TRAVIS: What's everybody doing back here while we're gone?

1449
01:08:50.223 --> 01:08:51.056
If I go.

1450
01:08:52.417 --> 01:08:54.145
LIAM: Well, first of all, I don't think we should just

1451
01:08:54.145 --> 01:08:56.613
send a message to Essek if we're just introducing him

1452
01:08:56.613 --> 01:08:59.844
to a human from the, elf, excuse me,

1453
01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:04.094
elf from, are they going to appear as themself, or?

1454
01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:06.757
MARISHA and TALIESIN: No.

1455
01:09:06.757 --> 01:09:10.174
MATT: "I will maintain the alteration."

1456
01:09:11.618 --> 01:09:13.714
TRAVIS: Alteration of what, what do you mean by that?

1457
01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:15.298
SAM: Becoming a drow, right?

1458
01:09:15.298 --> 01:09:17.017
You can seem like a drow.

1459
01:09:17.017 --> 01:09:19.381
LIAM: Face to face rather than a cell phone message.

1460
01:09:19.381 --> 01:09:21.994
LAURA: Does Dairon look like a drow now, or--

1461
01:09:21.994 --> 01:09:25.306
MATT: Dairon has not dropped the form that you met Dairon in

1462
01:09:25.306 --> 01:09:27.414
back in Asarius.

1463
01:09:27.414 --> 01:09:29.364
TRAVIS: If you look like a drow, you're going to need to say

1464
01:09:29.364 --> 01:09:34.364
that you're with a particular clique, clan, pal, smack,

1465
01:09:34.769 --> 01:09:36.152
what are they called?

1466
01:09:36.152 --> 01:09:37.576
Den?
LAURA and SAM: Den.

1467
01:09:37.576 --> 01:09:39.407
MATT: "Right, as far as my research goes,

1468
01:09:39.407 --> 01:09:41.537
"not everyone belongs to a den.

1469
01:09:41.537 --> 01:09:43.458
"They eventually can be brought into one,

1470
01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:45.629
"if they're not born into one, or if their soul

1471
01:09:45.629 --> 01:09:49.597
"once belonged to one, they can be returned to a den.

1472
01:09:49.597 --> 01:09:52.585
"But in most cases, you have to earn your way into one.

1473
01:09:52.585 --> 01:09:55.069
"As I am a servant, I figure as part of this

1474
01:09:55.069 --> 01:09:59.476
"it would be easy to believe that this is a first life

1475
01:09:59.476 --> 01:10:02.486
"for myself, and a den has not yet accepted

1476
01:10:02.486 --> 01:10:06.547
"or have I found one that was of my interest."

1477
01:10:06.547 --> 01:10:08.938
LIAM: What if we say that you are living in beast town

1478
01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:12.347
so that it makes sense that no one has seen you before.

1479
01:10:12.347 --> 01:10:14.708
MATT: "Asarius is not a bad idea.

1480
01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:18.216
"I will go with that."

1481
01:10:18.216 --> 01:10:21.459
SAM: The question remains: are we going to introduce

1482
01:10:21.459 --> 01:10:26.459
Dairon to Essek, or just splitskis?

1483
01:10:26.738 --> 01:10:29.571
MARISHA: No, I think we should introduce.

1484
01:10:31.156 --> 01:10:34.057
But we could do that, if you guys want to go ahead

1485
01:10:34.057 --> 01:10:36.272
and get a head start.

1486
01:10:36.272 --> 01:10:37.484
SAM: Fine by me.

1487
01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:39.133
LIAM: I agree, but I would say that I'm

1488
01:10:39.133 --> 01:10:43.105
not entirely sure of Essek's intentions.

1489
01:10:43.105 --> 01:10:47.605
So if we introduce you to this individual,

1490
01:10:47.605 --> 01:10:50.645
be extremely careful with him.

1491
01:10:50.645 --> 01:10:53.895
MATT: "I am extremely careful with everyone."

1492
01:10:54.811 --> 01:10:55.752
MARISHA: Are we all--

1493
01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:58.252
LAURA: He's pretty hot, so.

1494
01:10:58.252 --> 01:10:59.577
MATT: "Hmm."

1495
01:11:01.226 --> 01:11:03.588
TRAVIS: Plus doesn't he possibly have the ability

1496
01:11:03.588 --> 01:11:05.745
to see through disguises and stuff?

1497
01:11:05.745 --> 01:11:07.453
TRAVIS: What was that?

1498
01:11:07.453 --> 01:11:09.670
TRAVIS: Doesn't he have the ability to see through

1499
01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:11.337
disguises and stuff?

1500
01:11:13.407 --> 01:11:14.518
SAM: Maybe.
MARISHA: Essek?

1501
01:11:14.518 --> 01:11:15.351
MATT: Maybe.

1502
01:11:16.999 --> 01:11:19.243
TRAVIS: Just saying, if you're going to be here by yourself,

1503
01:11:19.243 --> 01:11:23.418
introducing your spy friend to Essek,

1504
01:11:23.418 --> 01:11:25.650
it better go well.

1505
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:28.061
MATT: "This is not an illusion, in particular.

1506
01:11:28.061 --> 01:11:31.698
"It is a transmutation of the flesh."

1507
01:11:31.698 --> 01:11:33.147
LAURA: Oh.

1508
01:11:33.147 --> 01:11:36.364
MATT: "There are some forms of magic that can see through,

1509
01:11:36.364 --> 01:11:38.353
"but I will not be delving close enough

1510
01:11:38.353 --> 01:11:41.627
"or in circles where such disenchantments

1511
01:11:41.627 --> 01:11:45.288
"are hopefully present."

1512
01:11:45.288 --> 01:11:47.205
TALIESIN: Pretty fancy.
LIAM: Fingers crossed.

1513
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.721
SAM: All right.

1514
01:11:49.721 --> 01:11:54.688
MARISHA: Are we all comfortable splitting up for 24 hours?

1515
01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:58.490
Y'all aren't going to get into any fights in Nicodranas

1516
01:11:58.490 --> 01:12:00.311
that we're not going to be a part of?

1517
01:12:00.311 --> 01:12:01.502
SAM: Definitely not.

1518
01:12:01.502 --> 01:12:04.328
MARISHA: Because you know I would feel super left out

1519
01:12:04.328 --> 01:12:06.110
if I didn't get to fight.

1520
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:07.580
SAM: If we fight anyone in Nicodranas,

1521
01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.229
we will bring the fight back to you.

1522
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:11.229
MARISHA: All right.

1523
01:12:12.775 --> 01:12:14.241
I like it.

1524
01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:19.580
LIAM: So the question of what we are doing with your family,

1525
01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:23.854
and you, when we are there, are you staying there?

1526
01:12:23.854 --> 01:12:28.717
SAM: I mean, we need to talk about that with Yeza, probably.

1527
01:12:28.717 --> 01:12:30.919
MARISHA: Wait, is this goodbye, you're not coming back?

1528
01:12:30.919 --> 01:12:34.375
SAM: I don't know, I'll see you, yeah, no, I'll come back.

1529
01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:37.218
I don't know, I want to talk about it with Yeza first.

1530
01:12:37.218 --> 01:12:39.991
LIAM: If we leave, two of you or three of you,

1531
01:12:39.991 --> 01:12:43.909
I have spoken of my reservations before.

1532
01:12:43.909 --> 01:12:48.900
I don't know if you have a plan for living there.

1533
01:12:50.236 --> 01:12:52.819
LAURA: They can stay at the Chateau.

1534
01:12:53.825 --> 01:12:57.733
LIAM: Well, I still worry about that letter.

1535
01:12:59.089 --> 01:13:00.429
LAURA: Oh.

1536
01:13:00.429 --> 01:13:03.890
SAM: Maybe we'll see some evidence if we get there,

1537
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:06.061
can snoop around see if anyone's

1538
01:13:06.061 --> 01:13:08.761
keeping their eye on the Chateau.

1539
01:13:08.761 --> 01:13:11.404
LAURA: And Bluud is really really tough, I mean,

1540
01:13:11.404 --> 01:13:16.195
he's done a good job of keeping secure and safe.

1541
01:13:17.216 --> 01:13:19.162
TALIESIN: If we put in a request for everything we need

1542
01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.525
to be delivered tomorrow, then we could all move one

1543
01:13:21.525 --> 01:13:23.476
and then come back and everything should be here,

1544
01:13:23.476 --> 01:13:26.258
and then we can all do the introduction

1545
01:13:26.258 --> 01:13:28.841
when they deliver what we need.

1546
01:13:30.264 --> 01:13:32.003
MARISHA: So we're all here to introduce Dairon?

1547
01:13:32.003 --> 01:13:33.947
TALIESIN: And then we all go, but we would just have to

1548
01:13:33.947 --> 01:13:38.947
break the order of operations up.

1549
01:13:39.994 --> 01:13:41.155
LIAM: That's fine, too.

1550
01:13:41.155 --> 01:13:43.607
But what I am talking about, Nott,

1551
01:13:43.607 --> 01:13:46.435
is as a long-term problem.

1552
01:13:46.435 --> 01:13:48.437
Something could happen in two days or three days,

1553
01:13:48.437 --> 01:13:49.307
or two weeks.

1554
01:13:49.307 --> 01:13:50.657
MARISHA: Yeah, but there's a war

1555
01:13:50.657 --> 01:13:52.248
raging across the continent.

1556
01:13:52.248 --> 01:13:57.024
That could be true for anywhere, at any time.

1557
01:13:57.024 --> 01:13:58.560
TRAVIS: Yeah, leap of faith time.

1558
01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.933
LIAM: I worry.

1559
01:13:59.933 --> 01:14:02.520
SAM: Of course, I worry, too.

1560
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.887
LAURA: I have a feeling, you know, there's lots of things

1561
01:14:04.887 --> 01:14:06.953
happening, Caleb, and maybe they're not going to focus

1562
01:14:06.953 --> 01:14:10.868
all their energy on looking for you right now, you know?

1563
01:14:10.868 --> 01:14:15.416
Or looking for whoever knew their name, I mean,

1564
01:14:15.416 --> 01:14:19.241
especially all the way in Nicodranas.

1565
01:14:20.378 --> 01:14:23.878
TALIESIN: Would seem to be a poor use of resources, really.

1566
01:14:23.878 --> 01:14:25.234
LAURA: I agree.

1567
01:14:25.234 --> 01:14:26.067
TALIESIN: Hmm.

1568
01:14:29.931 --> 01:14:31.914
Maybe you've got a little more invisibility

1569
01:14:31.914 --> 01:14:34.302
than you thought for a while.

1570
01:14:34.302 --> 01:14:36.059
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> okay.

1571
01:14:36.059 --> 01:14:36.892
TALIESIN: Maybe.

1572
01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:41.495
So is that a plan?

1573
01:14:41.495 --> 01:14:43.965
SAM: What is the plan? Are we all going or we all staying?

1574
01:14:43.965 --> 01:14:45.148
TALIESIN: We're going to put in an order for some food

1575
01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:49.356
and some maps to be delivered tomorrow, to the house.

1576
01:14:50.344 --> 01:14:52.907
Do we have transportation at this point,

1577
01:14:52.907 --> 01:14:57.199
or are we just going to be up north?

1578
01:14:57.199 --> 01:15:00.210
LAURA: The Bright Queen said she could offer transportation.

1579
01:15:00.210 --> 01:15:01.276
TALIESIN: Excellent.

1580
01:15:01.276 --> 01:15:03.218
Food, maps, transportation.

1581
01:15:03.218 --> 01:15:05.461
Nothing too expensive or fancy.

1582
01:15:05.461 --> 01:15:07.929
Then we'll go now, be back tomorrow

1583
01:15:07.929 --> 01:15:10.732
and ask them to bring it tomorrow.

1584
01:15:10.732 --> 01:15:13.346
LAURA: Then we all go to Nicodranas,

1585
01:15:13.346 --> 01:15:15.870
and we have a nice beach day.

1586
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:18.508
TALIESIN: If we wanted.

1587
01:15:18.508 --> 01:15:20.281
Just in case something goes wrong.

1588
01:15:20.281 --> 01:15:24.956
MARISHA: It is really fucking cold

1589
01:15:24.956 --> 01:15:25.790
up here.

1590
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:28.873
TALIESIN: I'm nervous splitting the group up.

1591
01:15:31.176 --> 01:15:32.176
MARISHA: All right.
SAM: Let's stay together,

1592
01:15:32.176 --> 01:15:34.384
and then we can introduce Essek tomorrow.

1593
01:15:34.384 --> 01:15:36.251
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: All righty.

1594
01:15:36.251 --> 01:15:40.680
MARISHA: Dairon, can you not be seen for 24 hours?

1595
01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.340
MATT: "I think I could handle a day."

1596
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.192
MARISHA: Yeah.

1597
01:15:44.192 --> 01:15:46.595
Don't answer the door if anyone comes by.

1598
01:15:46.595 --> 01:15:47.928
MATT: "Not a problem."

1599
01:15:49.411 --> 01:15:52.938
TALIESIN: If we can message them for our list of supplies,

1600
01:15:52.938 --> 01:15:55.311
food, maps.

1601
01:15:55.311 --> 01:15:56.277
MATT: Okay.

1602
01:15:56.277 --> 01:15:58.532
Just figure out what it is you'd like to acquire

1603
01:15:58.532 --> 01:16:03.278
before the journey, and who you're sending it to.

1604
01:16:03.278 --> 01:16:06.195
SAM: Yeah, who are we asking for this?

1605
01:16:07.491 --> 01:16:10.518
TALIESIN: Who do we want to introduce your friend to?

1606
01:16:10.518 --> 01:16:12.143
SAM: Well, we can do that tomorrow.

1607
01:16:12.143 --> 01:16:12.976
MARISHA: Essek?

1608
01:16:12.976 --> 01:16:14.342
TALIESIN: Yeah, so we'll have Essek,

1609
01:16:14.342 --> 01:16:17.130
see if we can get Essek to put it together, then, or?

1610
01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:19.594
MARISHA: Does Essek do that type of thing?

1611
01:16:19.594 --> 01:16:21.288
MATT: You guys had discussed with the Bright Queen

1612
01:16:21.288 --> 01:16:24.296
about possibly acquiring a map of the Greying Wildlands,

1613
01:16:24.296 --> 01:16:27.954
which is not a readily available map at all.

1614
01:16:27.954 --> 01:16:29.369
(chuckles)

1615
01:16:29.369 --> 01:16:31.009
So they're looking into that.

1616
01:16:31.009 --> 01:16:32.509
Any other maps you want to acquire,

1617
01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:34.341
you can ask about that, as well as any other supplies

1618
01:16:34.341 --> 01:16:36.432
that you're looking for the journey.

1619
01:16:36.432 --> 01:16:40.062
MARISHA: I guess, yeah, we'll put it in with Essek.

1620
01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:41.552
SAM: With Essek?
MARISHA: I guess, yeah.

1621
01:16:41.552 --> 01:16:44.439
MATT: Okay. That's easy enough to handle.

1622
01:16:44.439 --> 01:16:46.065
LAURA: He's kind of our liaison.

1623
01:16:46.065 --> 01:16:48.077
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Exactly.

1624
01:16:48.077 --> 01:16:49.407
MARISHA: Our handler.

1625
01:16:49.407 --> 01:16:51.241
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

1626
01:16:51.241 --> 01:16:52.982
All right, cool.

1627
01:16:52.982 --> 01:16:54.869
TALIESIN: That list can go in.

1628
01:16:54.869 --> 01:16:56.653
MATT: Perfect.
LIAM: Essek is Brittany Walloch.

1629
01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:58.621
(laughter)

1630
01:16:58.621 --> 01:17:00.666
MATT: All righty, so.

1631
01:17:00.666 --> 01:17:04.437
Having your things prepared for the time being,

1632
01:17:04.437 --> 01:17:07.324
and it being late afternoon, or I'm sorry, late morning,

1633
01:17:07.324 --> 01:17:10.157
about close to midday, you assume.

1634
01:17:12.244 --> 01:17:16.119
You are welcome to make your journey to the Menagerie Coast,

1635
01:17:16.119 --> 01:17:18.057
if you'd like.

1636
01:17:18.057 --> 01:17:19.660
LIAM: Okay, okay.

1637
01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.233
SAM: This I've got to see.

1638
01:17:21.233 --> 01:17:23.790
LAURA: I want to take Nugget, I run upstairs to the tree

1639
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:26.538
and ask if Sprinkle wants to come, too.

1640
01:17:26.538 --> 01:17:27.625
SAM: Oh.

1641
01:17:27.625 --> 01:17:29.062
(chuckles)

1642
01:17:29.062 --> 01:17:31.677
LAURA: Sprinkle definitely is like attached to you,

1643
01:17:31.677 --> 01:17:35.806
and seems to be eager to go wherever you're going.

1644
01:17:35.806 --> 01:17:36.639
MARISHA: Aww.

1645
01:17:36.639 --> 01:17:38.028
LAURA: Did you miss me, buddy?

1646
01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:40.093
TRAVIS: Oh, but Jester, think, you could just leave him here

1647
01:17:40.093 --> 01:17:41.866
with this beautiful tree, and wouldn't it be great--

1648
01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:44.333
LAURA: No, no, he wants to come, hang out at my ear.

1649
01:17:44.333 --> 01:17:45.822
TRAVIS: He probably made like a little house

1650
01:17:45.822 --> 01:17:47.800
out of twigs and shit, like maybe put some paint--

1651
01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.743
LAURA: No.

1652
01:17:48.743 --> 01:17:49.990
TRAVIS: Okay.

1653
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:51.673
(laughter)

1654
01:17:51.673 --> 01:17:54.254
MATT: The crimson ferret remains curled up
behind Jester's neck,

1655
01:17:54.254 --> 01:17:57.013
almost like a fur collar to a coat.

1656
01:17:57.013 --> 01:17:58.109
MARISHA: What?
TALIESIN: The crimson ferret.

1657
01:17:58.109 --> 01:17:59.483
MARISHA: The crimson ferret.

1658
01:17:59.483 --> 01:18:00.930
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a good bar title.

1659
01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:02.163
TRAVIS: The crimson ferret.

1660
01:18:02.163 --> 01:18:03.974
(laughter)

1661
01:18:03.974 --> 01:18:06.685
LAURA: He's a weasel, they're different, okay?

1662
01:18:06.685 --> 01:18:07.518
MATT: Yeah.

1663
01:18:07.518 --> 01:18:08.604
TALIESIN: That would be a red weasel.

1664
01:18:08.604 --> 01:18:09.795
It's a crimson ferret.

1665
01:18:09.795 --> 01:18:12.285
(laughter)

1666
01:18:12.285 --> 01:18:13.835
SAM: Caleb, what do we need to do?

1667
01:18:13.835 --> 01:18:16.976
LIAM: I'm going to go to our laboratory,

1668
01:18:16.976 --> 01:18:18.658
and I will just take a couple of minutes

1669
01:18:18.658 --> 01:18:19.814
and then meet me in there.

1670
01:18:19.814 --> 01:18:21.078
Are we ready now-ish?

1671
01:18:21.078 --> 01:18:22.327
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, okay.

1672
01:18:22.327 --> 01:18:25.494
I will go to the laboratory, and

1673
01:18:27.808 --> 01:18:32.808
use 50 gold worth of chalk, and I'm going to minus that now.

1674
01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:34.580
TALIESIN: That's a lot of chalk.

1675
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.335
LIAM: Trace the circle and the correct sigils on the ground,

1676
01:18:39.335 --> 01:18:42.239
and it is prepared and ready to go for when they join.

1677
01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:43.072
MATT: All right.

1678
01:18:43.072 --> 01:18:45.145
As everyone gathers there, Caleb completes--

1679
01:18:45.145 --> 01:18:47.074
TALIESIN: Even marked his chalk.

1680
01:18:47.074 --> 01:18:49.742
MATT: Caleb completes the final sketches

1681
01:18:49.742 --> 01:18:52.335
within the center of the large circular equation

1682
01:18:52.335 --> 01:18:55.062
that he has drawn across the floor.

1683
01:18:55.062 --> 01:18:57.765
As it does, you watch the familiar exterior of it

1684
01:18:57.765 --> 01:19:00.117
begin to glow, and the runes begin to click in

1685
01:19:00.117 --> 01:19:02.638
and rotate until it forges itself

1686
01:19:02.638 --> 01:19:05.060
a final glowing point in the center,

1687
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:07.238
and you can see this lifting energy

1688
01:19:07.238 --> 01:19:10.854
just slowly gliding up

1689
01:19:10.854 --> 01:19:11.979
from the center of it,

1690
01:19:11.979 --> 01:19:14.867
and you acknowledge that you have six seconds

1691
01:19:14.867 --> 01:19:15.765
to dive into this.

1692
01:19:15.765 --> 01:19:17.148
LIAM: Yeah, okay, here we go, here we go, come on, come on.

1693
01:19:17.148 --> 01:19:19.850
LAURA: I grab Nugget too, and go through.

1694
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:22.222
MATT: You all dart into the center of the circle.

1695
01:19:22.222 --> 01:19:26.237
There's that sensation of feeling lifted suddenly.

1696
01:19:26.237 --> 01:19:30.129
That kind of, you know, almost roller coaster drop

1697
01:19:30.129 --> 01:19:32.452
type butterflies in the stomach,

1698
01:19:32.452 --> 01:19:37.344
and you all emerge within a dark stone chamber.

1699
01:19:37.344 --> 01:19:38.553
LIAM: Yeah.

1700
01:19:38.553 --> 01:19:39.628
SAM: Where are we?

1701
01:19:39.628 --> 01:19:40.760
What's the guy's name?

1702
01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.593
Where are we?

1703
01:19:41.593 --> 01:19:44.560
LIAM: His name is, let's keep our heads,

1704
01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.961
Yussa, his name is Yussa.

1705
01:19:45.961 --> 01:19:46.794
SAM and MARISHA: Yussa.

1706
01:19:46.794 --> 01:19:49.815
LIAM: We are at the, it was the top of his tower, correct?

1707
01:19:49.815 --> 01:19:52.449
MATT: It was higher up than the floor.

1708
01:19:52.449 --> 01:19:53.995
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: Than you guys arrived.

1709
01:19:53.995 --> 01:19:56.537
LAURA: Oh no, he's going to be so mad!

1710
01:19:56.537 --> 01:19:57.429
TRAVIS: Why?

1711
01:19:57.429 --> 01:19:59.603
LIAM: Not necessarily.

1712
01:19:59.603 --> 01:20:02.593
MARISHA: We probably should've told him that we were coming.

1713
01:20:02.593 --> 01:20:03.667
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: We probably should've told him

1714
01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:05.644
we don't have the thing any more.

1715
01:20:05.644 --> 01:20:06.921
TRAVIS: What thing?

1716
01:20:06.921 --> 01:20:10.261
SAM: The what? Oh yeah, he wanted that thing.

1717
01:20:10.261 --> 01:20:11.502
LIAM: We'll get to that.

1718
01:20:11.502 --> 01:20:12.636
(clears throat)

1719
01:20:12.636 --> 01:20:14.091
MARISHA: (laughs)

1720
01:20:14.091 --> 01:20:16.231
LIAM: Hello?
MARISHA: Oh.

1721
01:20:16.231 --> 01:20:17.190
Oh.

1722
01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:18.440
LIAM: Anybody home?

1723
01:20:20.127 --> 01:20:21.460
MATT: You hear some

1724
01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.651
footsteps about a minute and a half later,

1725
01:20:23.651 --> 01:20:27.176
(clicking), and the door opens,

1726
01:20:27.176 --> 01:20:30.929
and peeking through, you see the older goblin

1727
01:20:30.929 --> 01:20:35.781
with the really nice vest on and rolled up sleeves

1728
01:20:35.781 --> 01:20:38.290
glance through.

1729
01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:40.371
"Hello?

1730
01:20:40.371 --> 01:20:41.773
LIAM: Ah, hello.

1731
01:20:41.773 --> 01:20:45.421
Apologies for coming in unannounced.

1732
01:20:45.421 --> 01:20:48.382
Your master has given me an open invitation to return,

1733
01:20:48.382 --> 01:20:51.560
and in hindsight, I think we should have

1734
01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.994
sent some sort of message in advance--

1735
01:20:52.994 --> 01:20:55.267
MATT: "Probably, yes, but that's fine.

1736
01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.617
"Follow me to the downstairs chamber

1737
01:20:57.617 --> 01:21:00.053
"and I'll retrieve the master.

1738
01:21:00.053 --> 01:21:01.444
"This way."

1739
01:21:02.604 --> 01:21:05.965
The goblin leads you all down the spiraling staircase

1740
01:21:05.965 --> 01:21:07.962
towards the familiar base of the tower,

1741
01:21:07.962 --> 01:21:10.478
where you had previously first encountered

1742
01:21:10.478 --> 01:21:15.444
both this goblin and the master of the tower, Yussa.

1743
01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:18.624
The chairs and furniture have been rearranged.

1744
01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:19.869
In fact, there's more furniture here

1745
01:21:19.869 --> 01:21:22.102
than there was last time.

1746
01:21:22.102 --> 01:21:26.243
You're not sure if it has been changed upon your arrival

1747
01:21:26.243 --> 01:21:28.463
or has been in the interim.

1748
01:21:28.463 --> 01:21:31.370
Nevertheless, there's enough places to sit

1749
01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:32.537
for everybody.

1750
01:21:34.077 --> 01:21:36.185
You watch as the goblin leaves for a bit,

1751
01:21:36.185 --> 01:21:39.024
and you sit in the quiet chamber.

1752
01:21:39.024 --> 01:21:42.344
There's a small fireplace that's built into the side,

1753
01:21:42.344 --> 01:21:44.027
and as you guys sit and get comfy,

1754
01:21:44.027 --> 01:21:47.437
the fire flares up brighter, and the room gets warmer.

1755
01:21:47.437 --> 01:21:48.786
It's cozy.

1756
01:21:48.786 --> 01:21:51.619
The smell is a mixture of,

1757
01:21:53.387 --> 01:21:56.892
the burning wood from the fireplace with hints of jasmine,

1758
01:21:56.892 --> 01:21:59.961
it's a very pleasant, comfortable inferior.

1759
01:21:59.961 --> 01:22:02.530
No windows to the exterior.

1760
01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:07.530
A few moments pass before you hear the footfalls

1761
01:22:07.938 --> 01:22:09.923
of a figure returning, and there you see

1762
01:22:09.923 --> 01:22:14.054
descend from the staircase Yussa, his lithe elven form,

1763
01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:18.443
draping behind a long train of his robe.

1764
01:22:18.443 --> 01:22:19.276
LIAM: I stand.

1765
01:22:20.401 --> 01:22:22.357
MARISHA: I follow suit.

1766
01:22:22.357 --> 01:22:23.198
MATT: Okay.

1767
01:22:23.198 --> 01:22:25.411
You see his arms tucked into each of the sleeves,

1768
01:22:25.411 --> 01:22:27.711
where you can't see his hands.

1769
01:22:27.711 --> 01:22:30.546
Head is carried up with an air of,

1770
01:22:30.546 --> 01:22:32.054
you would almost mistake it for arrogance,

1771
01:22:32.054 --> 01:22:34.331
but this individual just seems to carry themselves

1772
01:22:34.331 --> 01:22:38.215
with an air of importance where they stand.

1773
01:22:38.215 --> 01:22:39.048
"All right.

1774
01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:42.172
"You have returned, it seems."

1775
01:22:42.172 --> 01:22:46.079
LIAM: Yes, I beg your pardon for doing so unannounced.

1776
01:22:46.079 --> 01:22:49.164
MATT: "I would prefer a heads up next time,

1777
01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:52.237
"but nevertheless, here we are.

1778
01:22:52.237 --> 01:22:56.237
"What brings you back to the Menagerie Coast?"

1779
01:22:57.159 --> 01:23:02.159
LIAM: We are transporting some

1780
01:23:02.417 --> 01:23:04.715
asylum seekers.

1781
01:23:04.715 --> 01:23:07.624
MATT: "Right," and looks over to Yeza, who's like,

1782
01:23:07.624 --> 01:23:11.089
"Hi, this is a very nice place you have."

1783
01:23:11.089 --> 01:23:12.430
"Thank you."

1784
01:23:14.162 --> 01:23:15.743
LIAM: We don't intend to stay long,

1785
01:23:15.743 --> 01:23:17.519
in fact, I think I can get us back

1786
01:23:17.519 --> 01:23:20.568
to where we came from on my own.

1787
01:23:20.568 --> 01:23:21.818
MATT: "That is good.

1788
01:23:22.852 --> 01:23:27.093
"Well, if I might inquire, out of personal

1789
01:23:27.093 --> 01:23:29.343
"and professional curiosity.

1790
01:23:32.459 --> 01:23:34.542
"What have you been up to?"

1791
01:23:36.517 --> 01:23:38.267
SAM: You know, you know.

1792
01:23:39.591 --> 01:23:41.152
Avoiding the war.

1793
01:23:41.152 --> 01:23:43.239
It's crazy out there.

1794
01:23:43.239 --> 01:23:45.650
If you get close to the Empire and Dynasty.

1795
01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:50.000
TALIESIN: I feel like we should mention the

1796
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.483
most recent encounter.

1797
01:23:55.092 --> 01:23:56.950
LIAM: There were so many.

1798
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:58.579
TALIESIN: With the Laughing Hand.

1799
01:23:58.579 --> 01:23:59.452
SAM: The Laughing Hand?

1800
01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:02.843
TALIESIN: Is at least probably worth mentioning.

1801
01:24:02.843 --> 01:24:04.071
I mean, that's--
MATT: "The Laughing Hand."

1802
01:24:04.071 --> 01:24:05.979
TALIESIN: Something we should probably tell everybody,

1803
01:24:05.979 --> 01:24:06.812
I imagine.

1804
01:24:06.812 --> 01:24:08.260
SAM: Sure, sure.

1805
01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:10.733
Unkillable monster that was released

1806
01:24:10.733 --> 01:24:13.126
way, way far away from here.

1807
01:24:13.126 --> 01:24:14.676
LIAM: Does that name mean anything to you?

1808
01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:15.830
MATT: "(sighs)

1809
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:17.796
"It does not ring any particular bells,

1810
01:24:17.796 --> 01:24:20.796
"but I can look into my tomes.

1811
01:24:22.249 --> 01:24:24.408
"If this creature you say is dangerous,

1812
01:24:24.408 --> 01:24:27.681
"it may call my attention to study."

1813
01:24:27.681 --> 01:24:31.793
LIAM: It is a long ways off, we have just come from

1814
01:24:31.793 --> 01:24:35.460
over the mountains, and over more mountains.

1815
01:24:36.868 --> 01:24:39.368
MATT: "Which mountains and how far?"

1816
01:24:40.484 --> 01:24:42.984
LIAM: The very edge of the Empire.

1817
01:24:44.545 --> 01:24:47.396
Have you heard news of the war?

1818
01:24:47.396 --> 01:24:49.135
MATT: "I have kept my eye, yes.

1819
01:24:49.135 --> 01:24:51.635
"It's important to be informed."

1820
01:24:53.062 --> 01:24:54.520
LIAM: Is it going well?

1821
01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.496
MATT: "From whose perspective?"

1822
01:24:56.496 --> 01:24:57.329
LIAM: Mine.

1823
01:24:58.806 --> 01:25:01.938
MATT: "What side is your perspective?"

1824
01:25:01.938 --> 01:25:03.688
LIAM: You know my accent.

1825
01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:07.727
MATT: "Not well.

1826
01:25:08.726 --> 01:25:10.059
"Not well at all.

1827
01:25:11.478 --> 01:25:14.889
"It's beginning to brim past the Dunrock.

1828
01:25:14.889 --> 01:25:19.872
"There was a series of failed incursions by the Empire.

1829
01:25:20.822 --> 01:25:23.014
"Many were killed.

1830
01:25:23.014 --> 01:25:26.605
"There is worry of them beginning to

1831
01:25:26.605 --> 01:25:30.110
"take land further in to the Marrow Valley."

1832
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:31.957
LIAM: But not yet.

1833
01:25:31.957 --> 01:25:33.865
MATT: "Not yet."

1834
01:25:37.163 --> 01:25:39.418
LIAM: You know, I have a Zemnian accent, I am Zemnian,

1835
01:25:39.418 --> 01:25:41.896
but we are somewhat unaligned.

1836
01:25:41.896 --> 01:25:42.885
MATT: "I gathered."

1837
01:25:42.885 --> 01:25:46.061
LIAM: We're just trying to find our way between the cracks,

1838
01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:49.452
and hopefully do what we can to lessen tensions

1839
01:25:49.452 --> 01:25:50.702
on either side.

1840
01:25:51.784 --> 01:25:53.568
MATT: "Well, I wish you the best of luck."

1841
01:25:53.568 --> 01:25:55.522
LIAM: Wouldn't that be something.

1842
01:25:55.522 --> 01:25:57.676
MATT: "We have similar, but different paths.

1843
01:25:57.676 --> 01:26:01.321
"We both wish to avoid choosing.

1844
01:26:01.321 --> 01:26:03.129
"The difference is, you wade in the flames

1845
01:26:03.129 --> 01:26:07.357
"while I prefer to stay far away."

1846
01:26:07.357 --> 01:26:09.043
SAM: Speaking of staying far away.

1847
01:26:09.043 --> 01:26:11.477
Have you seen, or felt or sensed,

1848
01:26:11.477 --> 01:26:13.431
I don't know what you're capable of,

1849
01:26:13.431 --> 01:26:17.497
any agents of the

1850
01:26:17.497 --> 01:26:21.129
Empire here in Nicodranas, maybe,

1851
01:26:21.129 --> 01:26:23.996
snooping around, asking questions, looking for people?

1852
01:26:23.996 --> 01:26:25.683
TALIESIN: Ooh.

1853
01:26:25.683 --> 01:26:26.958
MATT: "None that I've encountered,

1854
01:26:26.958 --> 01:26:28.800
"but it would not surprise me.

1855
01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.441
"I mean, there are many

1856
01:26:33.441 --> 01:26:35.453
sellswords looking for ways

1857
01:26:35.453 --> 01:26:39.170
"to make money, and wartime is very profitable."

1858
01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:42.122
SAM: But no organized presence here.

1859
01:26:42.122 --> 01:26:44.130
MATT: "No, no.

1860
01:26:44.130 --> 01:26:46.867
"Not that I have seen, at least.

1861
01:26:46.867 --> 01:26:51.867
"Even so, I mostly keep to just my segment of the city."

1862
01:26:52.753 --> 01:26:55.036
LIAM: Have you spent any time tinkering

1863
01:26:55.036 --> 01:26:56.629
with the gift that we left you?

1864
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:58.201
MATT: "Oh, quite a bit, very

1865
01:26:58.201 --> 01:26:59.201
"fascinating.

1866
01:27:01.293 --> 01:27:03.460
"How much time do you have?"

1867
01:27:05.708 --> 01:27:07.225
LIAM: Not much.

1868
01:27:08.696 --> 01:27:09.925
Not much.

1869
01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:11.574
SAM: How much time do you need?

1870
01:27:11.574 --> 01:27:14.591
MATT: "Oh, well, I could go on for weeks

1871
01:27:14.591 --> 01:27:19.149
"about the things that I've just begun to uncover.

1872
01:27:19.149 --> 01:27:21.438
"This is going to keep me busy for quite some time,

1873
01:27:21.438 --> 01:27:24.830
"so I thank you very much for entrusting it to me."

1874
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:27.925
LAURA: Did you get any gold from it?

1875
01:27:27.925 --> 01:27:30.427
MATT: "I've acquired quite a few interesting

1876
01:27:30.427 --> 01:27:34.036
"tidbits of information, and yes."

1877
01:27:34.036 --> 01:27:36.070
SAM: What's like the top one?

1878
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:39.135
(laughter)

1879
01:27:39.135 --> 01:27:41.103
MATT: You watch as he leans forward and looks you over

1880
01:27:41.103 --> 01:27:41.936
and goes,

1881
01:27:44.619 --> 01:27:47.552
"How much do you know of the Age of Arcanum?"

1882
01:27:48.742 --> 01:27:49.928
SAM: How much do I know about--

1883
01:27:49.928 --> 01:27:51.845
MATT: Roll a history check.

1884
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:54.326
SAM: 13.

1885
01:27:54.326 --> 01:27:56.211
MATT: 13, not much.

1886
01:27:56.211 --> 01:27:58.025
SAM: It was a long time ago?

1887
01:27:58.025 --> 01:27:59.854
MATT: "That it was."

1888
01:27:59.854 --> 01:28:04.067
So nothing that would probably be of interest to you.

1889
01:28:04.067 --> 01:28:05.881
LIAM: I'm interested, though.

1890
01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:07.862
Beauregard?
MARISHA: Yeah.

1891
01:28:07.862 --> 01:28:11.103
LIAM: Fjord, do you think that the two of you

1892
01:28:11.103 --> 01:28:15.756
could keep an eye peeled for any trouble?

1893
01:28:15.756 --> 01:28:17.227
Around Jester's house?

1894
01:28:17.227 --> 01:28:19.563
SAM: You want to stay here and learn some while we go back?

1895
01:28:19.563 --> 01:28:20.528
That's fine.

1896
01:28:20.528 --> 01:28:21.948
MARISHA: Yeah.

1897
01:28:21.948 --> 01:28:25.852
We can organize a place for Yeza, get him set up.

1898
01:28:25.852 --> 01:28:27.512
LIAM: I will join you later.

1899
01:28:27.512 --> 01:28:29.164
TALIESIN: I think that's a good plan.

1900
01:28:29.164 --> 01:28:32.581
We'll message you if we run into trouble.

1901
01:28:33.481 --> 01:28:35.133
MATT: "If you have some time, I would be curious

1902
01:28:35.133 --> 01:28:38.911
"to take another look at that device

1903
01:28:38.911 --> 01:28:41.246
"you had brought with you last time we had met."

1904
01:28:41.246 --> 01:28:43.339
TALIESIN: We didn't bring it this round.

1905
01:28:43.339 --> 01:28:46.503
LAURA: Yeah, we have it in a hidden spot.

1906
01:28:46.503 --> 01:28:50.260
MARISHA: It's too dangerous to carry with us.

1907
01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:54.612
MATT: Both Jester and Beauregard, make deception checks

1908
01:28:54.612 --> 01:28:55.858
for me, please.

1909
01:28:55.858 --> 01:28:57.175
(chuckles)

1910
01:28:57.175 --> 01:29:02.175
LIAM: We took your advice, it is significant,

1911
01:29:02.502 --> 01:29:05.596
and we thought carrying it around--

1912
01:29:05.596 --> 01:29:07.416
LAURA: I don't need to look at this.

1913
01:29:07.416 --> 01:29:08.934
Seven.

1914
01:29:08.934 --> 01:29:10.725
MARISHA: I'm good at this, I'm good at this.

1915
01:29:10.725 --> 01:29:11.612
20.

1916
01:29:11.612 --> 01:29:13.138
MATT: 20, okay.

1917
01:29:13.138 --> 01:29:14.745
LIAM: Carrying it through the sewers

1918
01:29:14.745 --> 01:29:16.921
didn't seem like a good idea anymore.

1919
01:29:16.921 --> 01:29:18.588
MATT: "Hmm, it would not.

1920
01:29:20.962 --> 01:29:21.920
"Well.

1921
01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:22.753
"Anyway."

1922
01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:28.022
LAURA: Okay, did you find a chamber
with a dead dragon in it?

1923
01:29:28.022 --> 01:29:31.713
With lots of gold and hordes of treasure.

1924
01:29:31.713 --> 01:29:34.119
MATT: "I did indeed find such a dragon."

1925
01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:35.541
TRAVIS: Ah.

1926
01:29:35.541 --> 01:29:37.611
LAURA: Did you save any of it?

1927
01:29:37.611 --> 01:29:39.722
Because technically we sort of killed it,

1928
01:29:39.722 --> 01:29:41.573
and some of that treasure is ours,

1929
01:29:41.573 --> 01:29:43.729
and we just didn't get to grab it.

1930
01:29:43.729 --> 01:29:45.927
LIAM: Well, technically, none of us killed it,

1931
01:29:45.927 --> 01:29:47.867
it was, never mind.

1932
01:29:47.867 --> 01:29:51.950
MATT: "Technically, you are responsible for destroying

1933
01:29:52.891 --> 01:29:55.040
"what many would consider to be a very

1934
01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:59.431
"arcane powerful creature that might be endangered,

1935
01:29:59.431 --> 01:30:03.731
"by some perspectives, that was owned and

1936
01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.541
"not in a scenario

1937
01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:10.538
"where you would claim ownership over such a haul,

1938
01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:11.650
"if you will.

1939
01:30:11.650 --> 01:30:14.277
LIAM: So that would be a no.

1940
01:30:14.277 --> 01:30:18.103
MATT: "Not to say that at some point down the road,

1941
01:30:18.103 --> 01:30:21.654
"should I manage to completely map out the interior of this,

1942
01:30:21.654 --> 01:30:26.065
"we may discuss some sort of finder's fee."

1943
01:30:26.065 --> 01:30:27.925
LIAM: Have you even begun?

1944
01:30:27.925 --> 01:30:29.487
MATT: "I've begun,

1945
01:30:29.487 --> 01:30:31.619
"but I'll be at this for quite some time."

1946
01:30:31.619 --> 01:30:35.335
LAURA: Did you find any powdered gems there?

1947
01:30:35.335 --> 01:30:37.244
I've been looking for some.

1948
01:30:37.244 --> 01:30:40.507
MATT: "Powdered gems, no,

1949
01:30:40.507 --> 01:30:44.956
"but I can keep an eye out for you, if you'd like."

1950
01:30:44.956 --> 01:30:45.797
LAURA: Okay.

1951
01:30:45.797 --> 01:30:46.797
MATT: "Very well.

1952
01:30:48.215 --> 01:30:49.048
"So."

1953
01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:52.360
LIAM: Do you still need me, then?

1954
01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:56.109
If we do not have the artifact in question?

1955
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:58.381
MATT: "Not in particular.

1956
01:30:58.381 --> 01:31:01.124
"Any other strange things in the world I should know about?"

1957
01:31:01.124 --> 01:31:05.859
TALIESIN: I mean, Laughing Hand is a big deal, I feel like.

1958
01:31:05.859 --> 01:31:07.050
MATT: "Fair enough.

1959
01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:09.926
"All right then, I'll begin to start that research."

1960
01:31:09.926 --> 01:31:12.659
MARISHA: To put it into perspective,

1961
01:31:12.659 --> 01:31:14.275
we've been finding devices

1962
01:31:14.275 --> 01:31:18.257
that have been opening up portals to the Abyss,

1963
01:31:18.257 --> 01:31:21.641
and it seems that there may be some sort of

1964
01:31:21.641 --> 01:31:26.474
incursion being planned by

1965
01:31:26.474 --> 01:31:27.728
demons.

1966
01:31:27.728 --> 01:31:28.561
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1967
01:31:29.736 --> 01:31:31.469
MARISHA: People who might

1968
01:31:31.469 --> 01:31:33.952
want to release this Laughing Hand.

1969
01:31:33.952 --> 01:31:35.292
MATT: "That is curious."

1970
01:31:35.292 --> 01:31:36.245
MARISHA: Yeah.

1971
01:31:36.245 --> 01:31:38.410
That's what we thought, too.

1972
01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:39.964
MATT: "I've been keeping an eye on reports

1973
01:31:39.964 --> 01:31:43.601
"of similar accounts happening within the Empire as well."

1974
01:31:43.601 --> 01:31:44.833
TALIESIN: Really?

1975
01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:46.519
MARISHA: I knew it!

1976
01:31:46.519 --> 01:31:51.436
MATT: "Similar struggles have occurred in Zadash as of late.

1977
01:31:51.436 --> 01:31:54.643
"Another in Pride's Call, I believe."

1978
01:31:54.643 --> 01:31:57.491
MARISHA: Ooh, that answers so many questions!

1979
01:31:57.491 --> 01:31:58.499
TALIESIN: Does it?
MATT: However,

1980
01:31:58.499 --> 01:32:01.013
by all accounts, and public

1981
01:32:01.013 --> 01:32:05.539
and private discussions, all manner of these attacks

1982
01:32:05.539 --> 01:32:07.335
and assaults have been decreed

1983
01:32:07.335 --> 01:32:12.335
as sourced by Kryn demonologists.

1984
01:32:12.626 --> 01:32:14.209
TALIESIN: That's not, yeah.

1985
01:32:16.334 --> 01:32:17.825
No.
MARISHA: Is that--

1986
01:32:19.004 --> 01:32:22.314
Is that a credible source, or is that just--

1987
01:32:22.314 --> 01:32:24.903
MATT: "That comes from both public cries

1988
01:32:24.903 --> 01:32:27.539
"and a number of credible sources

1989
01:32:27.539 --> 01:32:30.347
"from the interior of the Empire.

1990
01:32:30.347 --> 01:32:33.051
"Take that for what it is."

1991
01:32:33.051 --> 01:32:34.962
SAM: So we know that that's false.

1992
01:32:34.962 --> 01:32:36.074
MARISHA: Propaganda?

1993
01:32:36.074 --> 01:32:37.901
TALIESIN: We pretty much know that is not right.

1994
01:32:37.901 --> 01:32:39.555
LIAM: Just like in the city, in Zadash.

1995
01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:40.388
MARISHA: Yeah.

1996
01:32:41.386 --> 01:32:44.222
LIAM: Or no, it's earlier than that.

1997
01:32:44.222 --> 01:32:45.472
TALIESIN: Huh.

1998
01:32:45.472 --> 01:32:46.688
LIAM: Have you noticed--

1999
01:32:46.688 --> 01:32:48.080
I don't know if you leave this place--

2000
01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.502
have you noticed any Empire presence

2001
01:32:50.502 --> 01:32:53.261
more than normal here in Nicodranas?

2002
01:32:53.261 --> 01:32:56.089
MATT: "No, there is always some sort of Empire presence

2003
01:32:56.089 --> 01:32:59.713
"because of its proximity to the Empire here on the border.

2004
01:32:59.713 --> 01:33:02.058
"I believe they're placing as much

2005
01:33:02.058 --> 01:33:04.874
"force as they can towards the east.

2006
01:33:04.874 --> 01:33:08.957
"It is not very swollen on that side of things."

2007
01:33:10.828 --> 01:33:11.661
LIAM: Very well.

2008
01:33:11.661 --> 01:33:15.304
Well, apologies for intruding in your home.

2009
01:33:15.304 --> 01:33:17.731
SAM: Next time we'll call ahead so you can

2010
01:33:17.731 --> 01:33:19.959
get dressed or whatever.

2011
01:33:19.959 --> 01:33:21.709
MATT: "Thank you for that.

2012
01:33:22.554 --> 01:33:26.673
"And welcome to my home," he says to Yeza.

2013
01:33:26.673 --> 01:33:28.731
Yeza's already looking

2014
01:33:28.731 --> 01:33:31.306
at the pieces of furniture and on the shelf, all the books,

2015
01:33:31.306 --> 01:33:34.609
he's like, "Oh yeah, no, thank you.

2016
01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:36.108
"Can we go now?"

2017
01:33:36.108 --> 01:33:39.722
SAM: Yeah, yeah, let's get out of here.

2018
01:33:39.722 --> 01:33:42.246
MATT: You guys turn around, the door

2019
01:33:42.246 --> 01:33:44.937
opens on its own.

2020
01:33:44.937 --> 01:33:47.269
Curiously enough, the hinge is on the opposite side

2021
01:33:47.269 --> 01:33:48.942
from where you first entered it,

2022
01:33:48.942 --> 01:33:52.841
and leads you out into the center of the Open Quay,

2023
01:33:52.841 --> 01:33:54.401
here in Nicodranas.

2024
01:33:54.401 --> 01:33:57.220
(laughter)

2025
01:33:57.220 --> 01:34:02.220
MATT: At this point it's early afternoon, mid afternoon.

2026
01:34:02.383 --> 01:34:05.094
The sky is cloudless and blue.

2027
01:34:05.094 --> 01:34:08.749
The bright sky above you, the sunlight

2028
01:34:08.749 --> 01:34:10.881
warming your skin on contact.

2029
01:34:10.881 --> 01:34:12.624
You can smell the ocean breeze,

2030
01:34:12.624 --> 01:34:16.214
hear the waves and seagulls in the distance.

2031
01:34:16.214 --> 01:34:17.779
TALIESIN: What are we wearing?

2032
01:34:17.779 --> 01:34:18.955
MATT: You're wearing your Xhorhasian clothing.

2033
01:34:18.955 --> 01:34:22.483
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm instantly casting Disguise Self.

2034
01:34:22.483 --> 01:34:25.552
LIAM: I have it, I will, what does everyone want to,

2035
01:34:25.552 --> 01:34:28.426
nope, never mind, just used that spell slot.

2036
01:34:28.426 --> 01:34:31.778
TALIESIN: Yeah, I am casting Disguise Self.

2037
01:34:31.778 --> 01:34:36.443
I am going to look like a tall, old farmer, yeah.

2038
01:34:36.443 --> 01:34:39.960
I'm fisherman, I'm going fisherman this time.

2039
01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:43.643
MARISHA: I shed the coat, go to my

2040
01:34:43.643 --> 01:34:47.343
tank top and Thai pants look.

2041
01:34:47.343 --> 01:34:48.897
MATT: Dock worker Beauregard.

2042
01:34:48.897 --> 01:34:50.563
MARISHA: Yep.

2043
01:34:50.563 --> 01:34:51.571
MATT: Perfect.

2044
01:34:51.571 --> 01:34:52.795
TALIESIN: What's your name again?

2045
01:34:52.795 --> 01:34:57.795
LAURA: I Disguise Self to look my Fiona human persona.

2046
01:34:58.142 --> 01:34:59.218
MATT: You got it.

2047
01:34:59.218 --> 01:35:03.407
SAM: I'll change my armor, which can change,

2048
01:35:03.407 --> 01:35:07.715
just a simple gray, you know,

2049
01:35:07.715 --> 01:35:09.781
raw silk again,

2050
01:35:09.781 --> 01:35:13.695
and I'll put on my mask and gloves.

2051
01:35:13.695 --> 01:35:16.894
LIAM: I am going to make myself look like myself,

2052
01:35:16.894 --> 01:35:20.460
but wearing my old clothes, except that they're all clean.

2053
01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:22.035
MATT: All righty.

2054
01:35:22.035 --> 01:35:23.107
Fjord?

2055
01:35:23.107 --> 01:35:24.571
TRAVIS: Yeah, same thing.

2056
01:35:24.571 --> 01:35:26.796
First-gen Fjord in the house.

2057
01:35:26.796 --> 01:35:28.495
MATT: You got it, first-gen Fjord.

2058
01:35:28.495 --> 01:35:29.328
All right.

2059
01:35:30.453 --> 01:35:35.214
It is a welcome sight, especially for you, Jester and Fjord.

2060
01:35:35.214 --> 01:35:39.194
It is a homecoming after long weeks away

2061
01:35:39.194 --> 01:35:42.093
in environments far harsher than you ever expected

2062
01:35:42.093 --> 01:35:45.693
to have to endure or explore.

2063
01:35:47.248 --> 01:35:50.567
It fills you with a sense of warmth and hope

2064
01:35:50.567 --> 01:35:54.821
to be back to where a lot of this all began for both of you.

2065
01:35:54.821 --> 01:35:58.493
The city is yours, what do you wish to do?

2066
01:35:58.493 --> 01:36:00.955
SAM: Let's go to Jessie's house.

2067
01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:03.401
LAURA: Look Yeza, this is where you will live.

2068
01:36:03.401 --> 01:36:05.074
This city, isn't it beautiful?

2069
01:36:05.074 --> 01:36:06.154
SAM: Temporarily.

2070
01:36:06.154 --> 01:36:08.949
Like, we don't know if it's going to be forever, right?

2071
01:36:08.949 --> 01:36:10.736
MARISHA: Why would you want to leave this place?

2072
01:36:10.736 --> 01:36:11.648
Look at it.

2073
01:36:11.648 --> 01:36:12.481
SAM: It's nice.

2074
01:36:12.481 --> 01:36:13.916
MATT: You watch as Yeza has run off to like

2075
01:36:13.916 --> 01:36:16.258
the nearest intersection and is looking down the straight.

2076
01:36:16.258 --> 01:36:19.280
There's one large road that heads right down to the docks

2077
01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.084
where you can see the horizon and the ocean,

2078
01:36:21.084 --> 01:36:24.613
he's just like, "I'm sorry, I've just

2079
01:36:24.613 --> 01:36:26.322
"never seen the ocean before."

2080
01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:28.086
TALIESIN: It's quite a thing, isn't it?
SAM: It's not that great.

2081
01:36:28.086 --> 01:36:29.183
MARISHA: Let's walk down there.

2082
01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:31.238
SAM: I mean, we don't have to.
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait.

2083
01:36:31.238 --> 01:36:32.850
Don't do it yet, you should grab Luc

2084
01:36:32.850 --> 01:36:35.477
and then you can all see the ocean together.

2085
01:36:35.477 --> 01:36:37.177
MATT: "Okay, yeah, yeah, all right, let's do that."

2086
01:36:37.177 --> 01:36:39.536
SAM: Sure.
TALIESIN: What a good idea.

2087
01:36:39.536 --> 01:36:41.198
MATT: All right, you guys make your way

2088
01:36:41.198 --> 01:36:44.303
towards the Opal Archways and approach

2089
01:36:44.303 --> 01:36:47.347
the familiar sight of the Lavish Chateau.

2090
01:36:47.347 --> 01:36:51.747
LAURA: Oh man, Nugget's going to be so happy to see Mama.

2091
01:36:51.747 --> 01:36:56.029
MATT: As you guys come towards the front, it opens within.

2092
01:36:56.029 --> 01:37:00.427
You see the familiar sight of the dark wood interior.

2093
01:37:00.427 --> 01:37:02.334
The tables, since it is earlier in the day,

2094
01:37:02.334 --> 01:37:04.651
There's only a few customers at the time,

2095
01:37:04.651 --> 01:37:07.394
it tends pick up more around dusk.

2096
01:37:07.394 --> 01:37:09.993
You lead back up at the stairs, where Bluud,

2097
01:37:09.993 --> 01:37:13.191
the minotaur, stands there, looking a bit tired,

2098
01:37:13.191 --> 01:37:15.251
like about to fall asleep at the post,

2099
01:37:15.251 --> 01:37:16.995
and then hears the footsteps arrive,

2100
01:37:16.995 --> 01:37:20.021
and then notices you guys approach, sees you,

2101
01:37:20.021 --> 01:37:24.910
still as your illusory persona, Jester.

2102
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:28.174
LAURA: Yeah, but I look like me only human, it's fine.

2103
01:37:28.174 --> 01:37:29.007
MATT: Yeah, so.

2104
01:37:29.007 --> 01:37:30.562
(laughter)

2105
01:37:30.562 --> 01:37:35.079
So Bluud goes, "Ah, Jester."

2106
01:37:35.079 --> 01:37:36.377
LAURA: I hug him.

2107
01:37:36.377 --> 01:37:37.210
MATT: "Yeah."

2108
01:37:37.210 --> 01:37:38.437
He awkwardly takes the hug

2109
01:37:38.437 --> 01:37:40.205
and pats you on the shoulder.

2110
01:37:40.205 --> 01:37:43.949
Standing almost like, double the size of Jester.

2111
01:37:43.949 --> 01:37:48.305
"Should I fetch your mother?"

2112
01:37:48.305 --> 01:37:49.982
LAURA: Yeah, is she busy?

2113
01:37:49.982 --> 01:37:51.665
MATT: "No, just looking over,"

2114
01:37:51.665 --> 01:37:53.578
and then the door opens,

2115
01:37:53.578 --> 01:37:56.578
and you can see Marion goes, "Jester?"

2116
01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.046
She rushes out, throws the door open,

2117
01:38:00.046 --> 01:38:02.082
it slams into Bluud, who grabs it,

2118
01:38:02.082 --> 01:38:03.977
and she just reaches out and puts her arms up

2119
01:38:03.977 --> 01:38:06.794
under your arms and lifts you up about a foot off the ground

2120
01:38:06.794 --> 01:38:10.794
and just holds you and goes: "Jester, my sapphire.

2121
01:38:13.352 --> 01:38:14.185
"So.

2122
01:38:15.722 --> 01:38:17.757
"You've all returned.

2123
01:38:17.757 --> 01:38:18.590
"Welcome.

2124
01:38:21.355 --> 01:38:25.286
"And you must be," and looks over to Yeza.

2125
01:38:25.286 --> 01:38:27.543
"Hi."

2126
01:38:27.543 --> 01:38:29.778
SAM: This is Jester's mom.
MATT: "Okay."

2127
01:38:29.778 --> 01:38:34.141
SAM: She lives here, and she's a fantastic performer,

2128
01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:38.703
and a great mom, and also, she might know

2129
01:38:38.703 --> 01:38:41.218
where Luc is right now?

2130
01:38:41.218 --> 01:38:42.873
MATT: "Oh, I'm so sorry.

2131
01:38:42.873 --> 01:38:44.370
"Yes, of course, right this way."

2132
01:38:44.370 --> 01:38:45.382
SAM: Oh, oh, okay, okay, hold on.

2133
01:38:45.382 --> 01:38:49.537
I'm going to just cast Disguise Self and change into Veth.

2134
01:38:49.537 --> 01:38:50.370
MATT: Okay.

2135
01:38:51.245 --> 01:38:53.165
LIAM: Are we in the public eye at this point still, or?

2136
01:38:53.165 --> 01:38:55.617
MATT: You guys are upstairs in the,

2137
01:38:55.617 --> 01:38:57.322
there's like a curving staircase

2138
01:38:57.322 --> 01:38:58.475
that leads up to the second floor,

2139
01:38:58.475 --> 01:39:00.404
where Marion stays in the Lavish Chateau.

2140
01:39:00.404 --> 01:39:03.002
It's a little landing with other rooms, but her room is--

2141
01:39:03.002 --> 01:39:04.503
LAURA: It's kind of hidden from the rest.

2142
01:39:04.503 --> 01:39:05.396
LIAM: Right now.

2143
01:39:05.396 --> 01:39:07.456
The entire time we're here, at any point,

2144
01:39:07.456 --> 01:39:10.004
Caleb is trying to subtly look for weirdos.

2145
01:39:10.004 --> 01:39:12.671
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check.

2146
01:39:15.122 --> 01:39:16.715
SAM: Looking for weirdos.

2147
01:39:16.715 --> 01:39:18.268
LIAM: 20, he knows what I mean.

2148
01:39:18.268 --> 01:39:19.360
MATT: 20, okay.

2149
01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.048
TALIESIN: I've got a passive perception of 19, you know.

2150
01:39:23.048 --> 01:39:25.496
MATT: ♪ People are strange. ♪

2151
01:39:25.496 --> 01:39:27.695
LIAM: All the damn vampires.

2152
01:39:27.695 --> 01:39:29.398
(laughter)

2153
01:39:29.398 --> 01:39:30.398
MATT: All right.

2154
01:39:30.398 --> 01:39:34.521
You guys step into Marion's professional chambers,

2155
01:39:34.521 --> 01:39:36.944
where you've met her before.

2156
01:39:36.944 --> 01:39:39.248
You can see there's the back room as well is open.

2157
01:39:39.248 --> 01:39:43.076
There you see, sitting and in the process of knitting,

2158
01:39:43.076 --> 01:39:44.750
is old Edith.

2159
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:45.583
SAM: Ah.

2160
01:39:45.583 --> 01:39:48.997
MATT: Who looks over the shoulder, and goes like,

2161
01:39:48.997 --> 01:39:52.165
"Oh, look, we got all sorts of folks coming.

2162
01:39:52.165 --> 01:39:54.142
"Oh, I know these people.

2163
01:39:54.142 --> 01:39:55.631
"Luc?"

2164
01:39:55.631 --> 01:40:00.088
From off the balcony of the chamber, you can see

2165
01:40:00.088 --> 01:40:05.088
Luc turns and enters the room, and sees both Yeza and Veth,

2166
01:40:05.431 --> 01:40:09.388
and goes, "Mom, Dad?!" and just runs forward,

2167
01:40:09.388 --> 01:40:11.970
and as both of you put your arms out,

2168
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:14.160
he runs into both of your arms, and you just

2169
01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.603
hold him there, and there's this moment that stretches on

2170
01:40:18.603 --> 01:40:23.603
for a minute or more of just the union of this family

2171
01:40:23.785 --> 01:40:27.815
that's been so separated for so long,

2172
01:40:27.815 --> 01:40:30.421
the three of them for the first time in many years

2173
01:40:30.421 --> 01:40:34.771
coming together, framed by the ocean and sky

2174
01:40:34.771 --> 01:40:37.254
beyond the balcony.

2175
01:40:38.475 --> 01:40:42.751
Edith stands up and smiles a bit

2176
01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:44.643
and wipes a tear from her eye,

2177
01:40:44.643 --> 01:40:46.934
and Marion comes over and puts her arm

2178
01:40:46.934 --> 01:40:51.562
and hooks it into Jester's arm as you all watch on.

2179
01:40:51.562 --> 01:40:56.130
Eventually, Luc breaks back a little bit and goes,

2180
01:40:57.138 --> 01:41:00.353
"So what's, where have you guys been?"

2181
01:41:00.353 --> 01:41:02.840
SAM: It's an incredibly long story,

2182
01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:05.116
and we'll tell you sometime.

2183
01:41:05.116 --> 01:41:08.941
Right now, all you need to know

2184
01:41:08.941 --> 01:41:13.866
is we're safe and we're together, and

2185
01:41:16.099 --> 01:41:19.028
things are going to start being better and easier now.

2186
01:41:19.028 --> 01:41:21.548
It must have been such a long journey.

2187
01:41:21.548 --> 01:41:24.705
Edith, how was the road here?

2188
01:41:24.705 --> 01:41:28.293
MATT: "It was sorta bumpy a lot,

2189
01:41:28.293 --> 01:41:31.168
"but that nice Shakäste fella made sure that we were

2190
01:41:31.168 --> 01:41:33.733
"nice and comfortable and safe,

2191
01:41:33.733 --> 01:41:36.975
"and he's smart as a whip, that one."

2192
01:41:36.975 --> 01:41:39.939
SAM: Any dangers before you, when you crossed

2193
01:41:39.939 --> 01:41:41.950
over the border or anything?

2194
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:46.927
MATT: "A lot of them crownsguard were very nosy,

2195
01:41:46.927 --> 01:41:51.278
"but once again, that Shakäste fella,

2196
01:41:51.278 --> 01:41:52.870
"he knew what he was doing."

2197
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:55.506
SAM: Luc, did you see his bird?

2198
01:41:55.506 --> 01:41:56.339
MATT: "Yeah!"

2199
01:41:56.339 --> 01:41:57.449
SAM: Isn't that cool?

2200
01:41:57.449 --> 01:41:58.932
MATT: "It didn't make any sound unless you were

2201
01:41:58.932 --> 01:42:01.407
"really close to it. It was like (buzzing)!

2202
01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:03.571
"He said he could see through it."

2203
01:42:03.571 --> 01:42:05.886
SAM: It's true, he can, it's magic.

2204
01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:07.977
MATT: "That's so cool.

2205
01:42:07.977 --> 01:42:12.541
"And apparently the bird is royalty."

2206
01:42:12.541 --> 01:42:13.611
(laughter)

2207
01:42:13.611 --> 01:42:14.917
SAM: That's true, that is true.

2208
01:42:14.917 --> 01:42:16.641
MATT: "Have you been to the bird kingdom?"

2209
01:42:16.641 --> 01:42:20.375
SAM: No, I haven't, I didn't know there was one.

2210
01:42:20.375 --> 01:42:22.866
MATT: "Oh, well if you talk to him again,

2211
01:42:22.866 --> 01:42:24.116
"see if he'll take you."

2212
01:42:24.116 --> 01:42:28.496
SAM: Okay, I'll get tickets for both of us.

2213
01:42:28.496 --> 01:42:30.157
MATT: Yeza butts in at this point is like,

2214
01:42:30.157 --> 01:42:32.558
"And by the way, I think you should know

2215
01:42:32.558 --> 01:42:37.558
"that your mother here is quite the adventurer.

2216
01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:42.740
"I've been watching her just fighting all sorts of bad guys,

2217
01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:46.482
"and defeating monsters, and well, she kept your papa safe

2218
01:42:46.482 --> 01:42:48.574
"for quite some time."

2219
01:42:48.574 --> 01:42:52.567
SAM: I mean, I think your father's exaggerating a little--

2220
01:42:52.567 --> 01:42:56.816
MATT: Luc goes, "No!"

2221
01:42:56.816 --> 01:42:59.339
He's like, "No, no, I kid you not.

2222
01:42:59.339 --> 01:43:00.965
"Look, cross my heart.

2223
01:43:00.965 --> 01:43:04.716
"Your mama has been, I've watched her scare off

2224
01:43:04.716 --> 01:43:08.566
"terrible creatures, and I mean,

2225
01:43:10.011 --> 01:43:13.533
"why don't you show him your cool device,

2226
01:43:13.533 --> 01:43:15.168
"your crossbow device."

2227
01:43:15.168 --> 01:43:16.144
SAM: Oh, I mean--

2228
01:43:16.144 --> 01:43:17.860
MATT: He's like, "You have a crossbow device?

2229
01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:19.633
"Can I see it, can I see it, can I see it?"

2230
01:43:19.633 --> 01:43:21.494
SAM: No, you cannot play with it.

2231
01:43:21.494 --> 01:43:22.636
MATT: "Can I just look at it?"

2232
01:43:22.636 --> 01:43:24.279
SAM: It's very dangerous.
MATT: "Can I touch it?"

2233
01:43:24.279 --> 01:43:26.230
SAM: I can show it to you.

2234
01:43:26.230 --> 01:43:28.417
I'll show it to you.

2235
01:43:28.417 --> 01:43:32.032
Is there anything in the room fruity?

2236
01:43:32.032 --> 01:43:33.753
Like an apple or something?

2237
01:43:33.753 --> 01:43:34.944
MATT: Actually, yeah.

2238
01:43:34.944 --> 01:43:38.903
Marion does take her meals in the chamber,

2239
01:43:38.903 --> 01:43:41.022
and they're usually a platter with different foods,

2240
01:43:41.022 --> 01:43:42.675
you can see that there was mostly eaten meal

2241
01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:44.723
where there is an orange left,

2242
01:43:44.723 --> 01:43:48.316
only partially eaten.

2243
01:43:48.316 --> 01:43:49.885
SAM: Okay.

2244
01:43:49.885 --> 01:43:52.269
All right, I'll quick draw and fire on it.

2245
01:43:52.269 --> 01:43:54.992
(laughter)

2246
01:43:54.992 --> 01:43:56.420
MATT: (imitates crossbow firing)

2247
01:43:56.420 --> 01:43:58.414
Roll for an attack.

2248
01:43:58.414 --> 01:43:59.624
SAM: Okay, okay.

2249
01:43:59.624 --> 01:44:00.468
Attack.

2250
01:44:00.468 --> 01:44:01.526
MARISHA: I would laugh if it missed that.

2251
01:44:01.526 --> 01:44:02.915
SAM: 28.

2252
01:44:02.915 --> 01:44:03.904
MATT: 28.

2253
01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:06.159
(imitates crossbow firing)

2254
01:44:06.159 --> 01:44:09.441
The orange has been stapled to the wall,

2255
01:44:09.441 --> 01:44:11.286
and is currently still vibrating from the impact.

2256
01:44:11.286 --> 01:44:13.369
Everyone's like (gasps), Luc goes,

2257
01:44:13.369 --> 01:44:16.544
"That is so cool!"

2258
01:44:17.469 --> 01:44:18.960
He's reaching for it.

2259
01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:21.576
SAM: No, no, no, it's really dangerous, really dangerous.

2260
01:44:21.576 --> 01:44:22.577
Guns are bad.

2261
01:44:22.577 --> 01:44:25.206
I mean, crossbows are bad.

2262
01:44:25.206 --> 01:44:28.521
Don't touch this, this is not for you, it's too dangerous.

2263
01:44:28.521 --> 01:44:30.749
Here, I'll take the bolts out and make sure

2264
01:44:30.749 --> 01:44:34.461
that it's nice and, the safety's on, I don't know.

2265
01:44:34.461 --> 01:44:35.811
(laughter)

2266
01:44:35.811 --> 01:44:39.106
I'll let him hold it a little bit.

2267
01:44:39.106 --> 01:44:40.911
MATT: "It's heavy."

2268
01:44:40.911 --> 01:44:41.912
SAM: Yeah.

2269
01:44:41.912 --> 01:44:43.464
Oh, well, okay.

2270
01:44:43.464 --> 01:44:45.503
MATT: He begins to just point it.

2271
01:44:45.503 --> 01:44:47.790
SAM: I mean, you do look pretty cool with it.

2272
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:49.520
MATT: "Do I?"
SAM: Yeah.

2273
01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:53.113
MATT: Yeza's like, "Maybe we should not let him

2274
01:44:53.113 --> 01:44:54.482
"play with it too long?"

2275
01:44:54.482 --> 01:44:56.528
SAM: No no no, I'll take it back soon,

2276
01:44:56.528 --> 01:45:00.115
but maybe I could even teach him how to use it one time.

2277
01:45:00.115 --> 01:45:02.638
MATT: "Really?"
SAM: Yes, yes, of course.

2278
01:45:02.638 --> 01:45:04.482
You've got to know how to protect yourself.

2279
01:45:04.482 --> 01:45:06.447
MATT: He sticks his tongue out at Yeza, who's like (sighs).

2280
01:45:06.447 --> 01:45:09.895
SAM: But also learning science in school is important, too,

2281
01:45:09.895 --> 01:45:12.341
so we have to make sure that you're all signed up.

2282
01:45:12.341 --> 01:45:14.596
You know, it's about time for you to start school.

2283
01:45:14.596 --> 01:45:15.776
MATT: "Okay."
SAM: Yeah.

2284
01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:18.789
But you know, maybe a bit of a balance, right?

2285
01:45:18.789 --> 01:45:20.778
You could go to classes during the day,

2286
01:45:20.778 --> 01:45:24.189
and in the afternoon, training.

2287
01:45:24.189 --> 01:45:27.467
MATT: "With the crossbow?"

2288
01:45:27.467 --> 01:45:28.717
SAM: Not that one.

2289
01:45:30.166 --> 01:45:32.383
We'll get you a little one that shoots little

2290
01:45:32.383 --> 01:45:34.288
suction cup arrows.

2291
01:45:34.288 --> 01:45:36.121
(laughter)

2292
01:45:36.121 --> 01:45:37.659
MATT: "Okay."

2293
01:45:37.659 --> 01:45:38.979
SAM: For now.

2294
01:45:38.979 --> 01:45:42.597
MATT: Yeza tussles Luc's air.

2295
01:45:42.597 --> 01:45:44.168
He's still holding onto the crossbow,

2296
01:45:44.168 --> 01:45:45.893
he's not giving it back.

2297
01:45:45.893 --> 01:45:47.275
SAM: That's all right, I'll steal it form him.

2298
01:45:47.275 --> 01:45:48.737
MATT: All right. (laughter)

2299
01:45:48.737 --> 01:45:50.222
While this is happening, Marion

2300
01:45:50.222 --> 01:45:52.461
looks back towards Jester and just

2301
01:45:52.461 --> 01:45:53.848
put her fingers up into your hair

2302
01:45:53.848 --> 01:45:56.487
and holds her head against yours, and goes, "(sighs)

2303
01:45:56.487 --> 01:45:59.169
"I'm so glad you're safe."

2304
01:45:59.169 --> 01:46:02.197
LAURA: I'm so glad to be back, Mama.

2305
01:46:02.197 --> 01:46:04.674
MATT: "And," looks down, and you can see that

2306
01:46:04.674 --> 01:46:06.719
immediately at that point, Nugget just leaps up

2307
01:46:06.719 --> 01:46:09.852
and almost knocks Marion over, and is like (laughter).

2308
01:46:09.852 --> 01:46:11.614
(slurping)

2309
01:46:11.614 --> 01:46:13.529
Just licking her face, going like (laughs).

2310
01:46:13.529 --> 01:46:16.919
"Oh, wow, you are getting so big."

2311
01:46:16.919 --> 01:46:17.904
LAURA: He really is.

2312
01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:19.054
MATT: "Yeah.

2313
01:46:19.054 --> 01:46:21.929
"Pets are a lot."

2314
01:46:21.929 --> 01:46:23.581
LAURA: Pets are a lot, Mama.

2315
01:46:23.581 --> 01:46:26.833
MATT: "Not as much as tiny sapphires, but they are a lot."

2316
01:46:26.833 --> 01:46:29.221
(chuckles)

2317
01:46:29.221 --> 01:46:32.000
LAURA: I feel honestly a little bad,

2318
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.983
because you know, Nugget's been stuck at home,

2319
01:46:35.983 --> 01:46:38.320
and we've had to go off and do things,

2320
01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:42.237
and I don't want him to be in danger and stuff.

2321
01:46:43.534 --> 01:46:48.259
MATT: "Well, what are you trying to tell me?"

2322
01:46:49.456 --> 01:46:51.397
LAURA: Well, Nott?

2323
01:46:52.769 --> 01:46:53.965
Nott.

2324
01:46:53.965 --> 01:46:55.378
SAM: What, what?

2325
01:46:55.378 --> 01:47:00.378
LAURA: Maybe Luc would like a--

2326
01:47:00.444 --> 01:47:01.869
a pet?

2327
01:47:02.805 --> 01:47:05.267
SAM: A dangerous blink dog?

2328
01:47:05.267 --> 01:47:07.124
LAURA: He's not dangerous, he's sweet.

2329
01:47:07.124 --> 01:47:08.353
TRAVIS: He's a killer.

2330
01:47:08.353 --> 01:47:09.186
MATT: (panting)

2331
01:47:09.186 --> 01:47:10.770
TALIESIN: A sweet blink dog.

2332
01:47:13.047 --> 01:47:14.399
SAM: Yes.

2333
01:47:14.399 --> 01:47:17.880
I will give this child whatever he wants right now, yes.

2334
01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.645
MATT: Luc is still looking at the crossbow,

2335
01:47:19.645 --> 01:47:22.008
and just not even paying attention to the conversation.

2336
01:47:22.008 --> 01:47:23.762
SAM: Hey, Lukie, Luc.

2337
01:47:23.762 --> 01:47:25.645
MATT: "What?"
SAM: Hey.

2338
01:47:27.159 --> 01:47:28.667
Do you want a dog?

2339
01:47:28.667 --> 01:47:32.542
LAURA: Well, okay, look, here's the thing.

2340
01:47:32.542 --> 01:47:33.625
TALIESIN: Ah, that's over.

2341
01:47:33.625 --> 01:47:34.564
LAURA: Oh no.

2342
01:47:34.564 --> 01:47:35.917
(laughter)

2343
01:47:35.917 --> 01:47:38.212
MATT: And just like points at Nugget.

2344
01:47:38.212 --> 01:47:39.920
TALIESIN: With the crossbow.

2345
01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.883
LAURA: Technically, he's on loan, because you know,

2346
01:47:43.883 --> 01:47:47.161
he's my dog who I love very much, but I--

2347
01:47:47.161 --> 01:47:48.485
TRAVIS: You can have him it forever.

2348
01:47:48.485 --> 01:47:50.199
LAURA: I don't want him to be in danger,

2349
01:47:50.199 --> 01:47:54.224
and his name is Nugget, and you have to feed him,

2350
01:47:54.224 --> 01:47:55.897
and you have to take him on walks,

2351
01:47:55.897 --> 01:47:57.790
and you have to teach him how to blink,

2352
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:59.889
because he's still training.

2353
01:47:59.889 --> 01:48:02.417
SAM: Yeah, okay, but he's also five, so you know,

2354
01:48:02.417 --> 01:48:04.660
he's probably not going to take your dog on walks.

2355
01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:09.138
Your man servant or whatever can take the dog on walks.

2356
01:48:09.138 --> 01:48:10.806
MATT: Luc just walks up to Nugget now,

2357
01:48:10.806 --> 01:48:13.469
with the crossbow in hand, and just like,

2358
01:48:13.469 --> 01:48:16.134
reaches out to touch his nose,

2359
01:48:16.134 --> 01:48:19.456
and Nugget just (slurping), and like knocks him over

2360
01:48:19.456 --> 01:48:20.685
and starts licking his face.

2361
01:48:20.685 --> 01:48:21.755
(laughter)

2362
01:48:21.755 --> 01:48:23.787
He's laughing on the ground.

2363
01:48:23.787 --> 01:48:26.643
And Yeza's like, "Okay.

2364
01:48:26.643 --> 01:48:28.156
"Crossbow and a dog."

2365
01:48:28.156 --> 01:48:30.985
SAM: No, he's not going to keep the crossbow, don't worry.

2366
01:48:30.985 --> 01:48:34.373
LAURA: I'll trade you the crossbow for the dog, Luc.

2367
01:48:34.373 --> 01:48:39.373
MATT: Luc stands up, and goes, (sighs).

2368
01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.768
SAM: I'll throw in this grappling hook.

2369
01:48:42.768 --> 01:48:43.601
MATT: "Deal."

2370
01:48:43.601 --> 01:48:45.968
Hands the crossbow back, grabs the grappling hook

2371
01:48:45.968 --> 01:48:47.123
and goes back to petting the dog.

2372
01:48:47.123 --> 01:48:49.018
MARISHA: That's arguably more dangerous.

2373
01:48:49.018 --> 01:48:51.512
TALIESIN: As a child of divorce,
this is exactly what it's like.

2374
01:48:51.512 --> 01:48:52.896
(laughter)

2375
01:48:52.896 --> 01:48:55.282
This is the most amazing divorce simulator

2376
01:48:55.282 --> 01:48:56.922
I've ever experienced.

2377
01:48:56.922 --> 01:48:59.441
(laughter)

2378
01:48:59.441 --> 01:49:00.650
SAM: With every gift, my guilt--

2379
01:49:00.650 --> 01:49:02.973
TALIESIN: Dog, crossbow, what'll it take?

2380
01:49:02.973 --> 01:49:05.223
(laughter)

2381
01:49:06.484 --> 01:49:09.633
MATT: While this is happening, Marion looks back

2382
01:49:09.633 --> 01:49:12.856
and looks at Jester, and looks over at Fjord and goes,

2383
01:49:12.856 --> 01:49:16.124
"Has he been taking care of you?"

2384
01:49:16.124 --> 01:49:17.532
LAURA: Yeah.

2385
01:49:17.532 --> 01:49:18.375
MATT: "Good."

2386
01:49:18.375 --> 01:49:19.832
LAURA: I almost fell to my death.

2387
01:49:19.832 --> 01:49:21.339
He made sure that didn't happen.

2388
01:49:21.339 --> 01:49:23.164
TRAVIS: Yep, caught her on the quick.

2389
01:49:23.164 --> 01:49:27.336
MATT: "Good, very good, keep doing that, please."

2390
01:49:27.336 --> 01:49:28.911
MARISHA: I mean, she's also

2391
01:49:28.911 --> 01:49:31.086
totally been taking care of, you know,

2392
01:49:31.086 --> 01:49:33.593
herself and us as well.

2393
01:49:33.593 --> 01:49:36.701
It's kind of like, you know--

2394
01:49:36.701 --> 01:49:38.839
LAURA: A cycle.
MARISHA: Reciprocal.

2395
01:49:38.839 --> 01:49:40.464
MATT: "Right.

2396
01:49:40.464 --> 01:49:44.317
"A cycle that some would call, I don't know, friendship?"

2397
01:49:44.317 --> 01:49:48.471
MARISHA: Oh, I was going to say unhealthy, true story, yeah.

2398
01:49:48.471 --> 01:49:49.543
(laughter)

2399
01:49:49.543 --> 01:49:51.904
But friendship, yeah.

2400
01:49:51.904 --> 01:49:54.853
MATT: "To be fair, many friendships

2401
01:49:54.853 --> 01:49:59.384
"are not necessarily healthy, but can still be useful.'

2402
01:49:59.384 --> 01:50:01.509
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

2403
01:50:01.509 --> 01:50:03.662
So right.

2404
01:50:03.662 --> 01:50:04.495
Bless you.

2405
01:50:04.495 --> 01:50:07.318
LIAM: Miss Lavore, how many days have your guests been here?

2406
01:50:07.318 --> 01:50:08.585
TALIESIN: I'm okay.

2407
01:50:08.585 --> 01:50:11.447
MATT: "Oh, they've only been here about a week.

2408
01:50:11.447 --> 01:50:14.968
"They have come a long way.

2409
01:50:14.968 --> 01:50:18.878
"They've been asking around about Felderwin, I believe?"

2410
01:50:18.878 --> 01:50:22.609
And Yeza's like yeah, "Felderwin."

2411
01:50:22.609 --> 01:50:25.743
"Asking about how things are going.

2412
01:50:25.743 --> 01:50:29.533
"Apparently it's, you know, it's not quite time

2413
01:50:29.533 --> 01:50:33.145
"to go back yet, there are still challenges

2414
01:50:33.145 --> 01:50:36.687
"and battles being waged up there.

2415
01:50:36.687 --> 01:50:41.290
"Word of a rise in goblin attacks in the city as well,

2416
01:50:41.290 --> 01:50:45.873
"so we're just taking of them for as long as we need to."

2417
01:50:46.934 --> 01:50:48.678
LIAM: Very gracious of you.

2418
01:50:48.678 --> 01:50:51.087
MATT: "They are family of family, so."

2419
01:50:51.087 --> 01:50:52.426
SAM: Thank you so much.

2420
01:50:52.426 --> 01:50:53.259
MATT: "Of course."

2421
01:50:53.259 --> 01:50:54.835
MARISHA: While they're doing this, can I like

2422
01:50:54.835 --> 01:50:59.610
get a scan of Marion's desk and see if I like,

2423
01:50:59.610 --> 01:51:03.549
see any papers lingering out? Can I be nosy?

2424
01:51:03.549 --> 01:51:05.154
MATT: Perception check, go for it.

2425
01:51:05.154 --> 01:51:07.429
MARISHA: Perception, not investigation?

2426
01:51:07.429 --> 01:51:11.262
MATT: Investigation would be rummaging through it.

2427
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:13.533
MARISHA: Okay.

2428
01:51:13.533 --> 01:51:14.710
17?

2429
01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:15.663
MATT: 17.

2430
01:51:15.663 --> 01:51:18.504
Looking at the desk she has, which is like a partial desk,

2431
01:51:18.504 --> 01:51:21.109
partial vanity, this is her, you know,

2432
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:22.688
this is not where she sleeps normally,

2433
01:51:22.688 --> 01:51:24.605
this is her work chambers.

2434
01:51:24.605 --> 01:51:26.812
So this is where she spends most of her time,

2435
01:51:26.812 --> 01:51:28.195
but that way it's dressed up well,

2436
01:51:28.195 --> 01:51:29.446
and everything here has some sort of

2437
01:51:29.446 --> 01:51:30.556
presentational element to it.

2438
01:51:30.556 --> 01:51:32.595
It's beautiful desk-slash-vanity space.

2439
01:51:32.595 --> 01:51:33.967
TALIESIN: Secretary desk.

2440
01:51:33.967 --> 01:51:35.550
MATT: Little bit, yeah.

2441
01:51:36.577 --> 01:51:40.092
You don't see see anything that, you know,

2442
01:51:40.092 --> 01:51:41.741
is glaringly out of place.

2443
01:51:41.741 --> 01:51:45.660
There's papers and, you know, a couple of books.

2444
01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:48.082
Novel, you know, elements that maybe she reads

2445
01:51:48.082 --> 01:51:50.623
on her spare time.

2446
01:51:50.623 --> 01:51:53.410
Nothing that worries you from this distance.

2447
01:51:53.410 --> 01:51:56.200
You'd probably have to do a more thorough investigation.

2448
01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:57.033
MARISHA: Okay.

2449
01:52:00.666 --> 01:52:02.235
MATT: "There's a lot of people here.

2450
01:52:02.235 --> 01:52:04.822
"How long will you be staying, is my question.

2451
01:52:04.822 --> 01:52:06.652
"How many rooms should we look for?"

2452
01:52:06.652 --> 01:52:09.299
LAURA: I think just the one night.
TALIESIN: Just tonight.

2453
01:52:09.299 --> 01:52:10.841
MATT: "Oh, okay.

2454
01:52:11.735 --> 01:52:16.652
"Well, for the night then, you are our guests,

2455
01:52:17.863 --> 01:52:20.638
"we shall have a fine dinner.

2456
01:52:20.638 --> 01:52:22.220
"There is a performance troupe in town

2457
01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:25.811
"that might be able to take you out for an evening

2458
01:52:25.811 --> 01:52:30.620
"in the city, if you don't mind escorting them, Jester,

2459
01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:33.795
"and, you know,

2460
01:52:33.795 --> 01:52:36.795
make an evening of your brief stay,

2461
01:52:36.795 --> 01:52:38.708
"as a thank you."

2462
01:52:38.708 --> 01:52:42.819
MARISHA: You're telling us to go socialize?

2463
01:52:42.819 --> 01:52:44.339
MATT: "Well, you don't have to, I just assumed--"

2464
01:52:44.339 --> 01:52:46.044
MARISHA: No, it's just--

2465
01:52:46.044 --> 01:52:47.541
MATT: "You can stay here if you like.

2466
01:52:47.541 --> 01:52:50.480
"I just assumed that maybe--"

2467
01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:52.784
MARISHA: We don't often get the opportunity.

2468
01:52:52.784 --> 01:52:54.573
TALIESIN: I need a proper change of clothes.

2469
01:52:54.573 --> 01:52:58.713
Just if there's anywhere where we can just get something.

2470
01:52:58.713 --> 01:53:00.353
MATT: "There's plenty of places you can get it."

2471
01:53:00.353 --> 01:53:01.436
TALIESIN: That'll do.

2472
01:53:03.007 --> 01:53:04.318
(sighs)

2473
01:53:04.318 --> 01:53:05.739
LIAM: Jester, you're going to spend some time

2474
01:53:05.739 --> 01:53:07.368
with your mother, yeah?

2475
01:53:07.368 --> 01:53:12.079
LAURA: Oh, I have a feeling Mama might have a guest tonight.

2476
01:53:12.079 --> 01:53:14.099
MATT: "Oh, I can cancel."

2477
01:53:14.099 --> 01:53:16.443
LAURA: No, no.

2478
01:53:16.443 --> 01:53:20.177
MATT: "Yes, you're a little more important than me, huh?"

2479
01:53:20.177 --> 01:53:22.427
(laughter)

2480
01:53:25.167 --> 01:53:26.196
"It's fine."

2481
01:53:26.196 --> 01:53:29.461
TALIESIN: I think a night of relaxation is not uncalled for

2482
01:53:29.461 --> 01:53:32.044
considering the week we've had.

2483
01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:33.743
MARISHA: Yeah.

2484
01:53:34.716 --> 01:53:35.957
LIAM: You want to stay with your boy?

2485
01:53:35.957 --> 01:53:36.790
SAM: Yes.

2486
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:38.309
Yeah, I'll stay.

2487
01:53:38.309 --> 01:53:40.058
We'll just hang out here, probably,

2488
01:53:40.058 --> 01:53:43.670
or walk down to the beach.

2489
01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:44.744
MARISHA: Walk to the beach?

2490
01:53:44.744 --> 01:53:46.913
TALIESIN: Walk to the beach, then we'll see the show.

2491
01:53:46.913 --> 01:53:47.746
SAM: Yeah.

2492
01:53:47.746 --> 01:53:49.404
TALIESIN: I'm going to leave my very obvious jacket,

2493
01:53:49.404 --> 01:53:50.245
just in case.

2494
01:53:50.245 --> 01:53:51.847
MATT: "All right, well--"

2495
01:53:51.847 --> 01:53:54.416
LAURA: Hey Beau, I have some clothes in the room

2496
01:53:54.416 --> 01:53:58.591
if you want to change into something less, you know,

2497
01:53:58.591 --> 01:54:00.666
Xhorhasian.

2498
01:54:01.930 --> 01:54:04.813
MARISHA: Are they super froufrou-y?

2499
01:54:05.678 --> 01:54:07.928
Are they dresses with bows?

2500
01:54:08.945 --> 01:54:09.778
LAURA: Well...

2501
01:54:09.778 --> 01:54:12.076
MARISHA: I don't like bows.

2502
01:54:12.076 --> 01:54:14.151
I go check out her wardrobe.

2503
01:54:14.151 --> 01:54:15.754
Yeah, let's check it out.

2504
01:54:15.754 --> 01:54:17.102
MATT: All right, so Beau goes through your wardrobe.

2505
01:54:17.102 --> 01:54:19.512
What does she find?

2506
01:54:19.512 --> 01:54:23.130
LAURA: Lots of really cool, pretty dresses.

2507
01:54:23.130 --> 01:54:24.131
TALIESIN: Whatever that means.

2508
01:54:24.131 --> 01:54:27.081
LAURA: There's purple ones, there's a yellow one.

2509
01:54:27.081 --> 01:54:28.854
MARISHA: I fucking hate yellow.

2510
01:54:28.854 --> 01:54:31.134
I've been through this.

2511
01:54:31.134 --> 01:54:33.384
(laughter)

2512
01:54:38.961 --> 01:54:40.853
Beau, not me.

2513
01:54:40.853 --> 01:54:43.641
LAURA: This red one would look really nice on you.

2514
01:54:43.641 --> 01:54:45.450
MARISHA: All right, I put on the red one.

2515
01:54:45.450 --> 01:54:46.283
MATT: All right.

2516
01:54:46.283 --> 01:54:47.560
MARISHA: What's it look like?

2517
01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:48.893
Tell me, Jester.

2518
01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:52.126
LAURA: It's sleeveless.

2519
01:54:52.126 --> 01:54:53.477
MARISHA: Okay.

2520
01:54:53.477 --> 01:54:58.477
LAURA: It's fitted through the waist, &amp; then it flairs out.

2521
01:54:58.814 --> 01:55:03.814
It's got two bows, one right here and one right here,

2522
01:55:04.081 --> 01:55:09.081
and then a really nice ribbon that ties around the waist.

2523
01:55:09.085 --> 01:55:10.898
MATT: How long is it?

2524
01:55:10.898 --> 01:55:14.650
LAURA: It comes to just above the knee.

2525
01:55:14.650 --> 01:55:16.041
MATT: Okay.

2526
01:55:17.749 --> 01:55:20.305
LIAM: This is on page 211 of the Player's Handbook.

2527
01:55:20.305 --> 01:55:22.062
MATT: Yeah, right?

2528
01:55:22.062 --> 01:55:24.678
TALIESIN: This is my favorite part.

2529
01:55:24.678 --> 01:55:26.545
MARISHA: Jester--
LAURA: What?

2530
01:55:26.545 --> 01:55:29.728
MARISHA: Did you own this dress when you were 12?

2531
01:55:29.728 --> 01:55:30.561
LAURA: Well,

2532
01:55:31.898 --> 01:55:32.767
yeah.

2533
01:55:32.767 --> 01:55:34.249
MARISHA: Oh.

2534
01:55:34.249 --> 01:55:36.422
LAURA: But you know, you're so slender,

2535
01:55:36.422 --> 01:55:40.095
I thought it would look good on you.

2536
01:55:40.095 --> 01:55:44.975
MARISHA: I look like I'm trying out for a beauty pageant.

2537
01:55:44.975 --> 01:55:48.569
LAURA: You look really lovely, but if you don't like it,

2538
01:55:48.569 --> 01:55:51.652
you don't have to wear it, obviously.

2539
01:55:52.747 --> 01:55:55.616
MARISHA: I'll wear it for Jester.

2540
01:55:55.616 --> 01:55:57.128
MATT: All right.

2541
01:55:57.128 --> 01:55:59.546
LAURA: I'll put on the not yellow dress

2542
01:55:59.546 --> 01:56:02.356
because Beau doesn't like yellow.

2543
01:56:02.356 --> 01:56:03.867
I put on my purple dress.

2544
01:56:03.867 --> 01:56:05.236
MATT: Okay.

2545
01:56:05.236 --> 01:56:07.320
Purple Jester and red Beau.

2546
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.153
(laughter)

2547
01:56:08.153 --> 01:56:10.560
TALIESIN: I remove some layers and head down to the beach.

2548
01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:13.515
MARISHA: I find a hat, too, a big sun hat.

2549
01:56:13.515 --> 01:56:14.360
MATT: All right.

2550
01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:15.389
TALIESIN: Rolled out the sun hats.

2551
01:56:15.389 --> 01:56:16.789
MATT: Yeah, Marion definitely has one of those

2552
01:56:16.789 --> 01:56:17.906
you could borrow.

2553
01:56:17.906 --> 01:56:19.334
All right, as you gather your things,

2554
01:56:19.334 --> 01:56:23.167
and Yeza and Luc as well.

2555
01:56:23.167 --> 01:56:25.216
Edith decides to stay back.

2556
01:56:26.660 --> 01:56:30.039
You begin to make your way walking towards the shoreline

2557
01:56:30.039 --> 01:56:33.054
of Nicodranas to see the beach for the afternoon.

2558
01:56:33.054 --> 01:56:34.423
And that's where we're going to go ahead and take a break.

2559
01:56:34.423 --> 01:56:35.256
MARISHA: Hey!

2560
01:56:36.352 --> 01:56:37.920
MATT: We'll be back here in just a moment.

2561
01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:42.113
Before we get to it, we do have our Wyrmwood giveaway.

2562
01:56:42.113 --> 01:56:46.410
Tonight we have, to give away, the black walnut dice vault.

2563
01:56:46.410 --> 01:56:50.151
This nice, pretty, smooth brown wood,

2564
01:56:50.151 --> 01:56:52.503
for one lucky winner there in the chat.

2565
01:56:52.503 --> 01:56:54.872
To enter tonight, go ahead and enter

2566
01:56:54.872 --> 01:56:59.103
the keyword tonight, which is kiln, K-I-L-N.

2567
01:56:59.103 --> 01:57:00.756
SAM: That's exactly where we're going.

2568
01:57:00.756 --> 01:57:02.508
(laughter)

2569
01:57:02.508 --> 01:57:03.915
LIAM: Killin' it, kiln.

2570
01:57:03.915 --> 01:57:05.723
MATT: K-I-L-N, once.

2571
01:57:05.723 --> 01:57:07.081
More than once and you'll be disqualified,

2572
01:57:07.081 --> 01:57:09.421
in the chat for people in the US and Canada,

2573
01:57:09.421 --> 01:57:11.262
excluding Quebec, we'll have a winner for you

2574
01:57:11.262 --> 01:57:12.330
when we get back here in a few minutes.

2575
01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:13.913
See you soon.

2690

2694
02:02:33.575 --> 02:02:36.816

I'm a fan of a wife so cool, people forget I exist.

2763
02:05:29.978 --> 02:05:31.113
Exist.

2764
02:05:31.113 --> 02:05:33.606
(eerie music)

2765
02:05:33.606 --> 02:05:35.984
(elephant sounds)

2766
02:05:35.984 --> 02:05:37.982
(explosion booms)

2767
02:05:37.982 --> 02:05:40.722
(robot beeping)

2768
02:05:40.722 --> 02:05:45.488
(eerie music and sound effects)

2769
02:05:48.393 --> 02:05:50.893
(baby crying)

2770
02:05:56.473 --> 02:06:01.457
I'm a fan of wearing your skin as a mask.

2771
02:06:05.027 --> 02:06:09.940
["Spring" from Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons"]

2772
02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:14.300
["Spring" from Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons"]

2773
02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:18.889
["Spring" from Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons"]

2774
02:06:18.889 --> 02:06:21.639
(dramatic music)

2775
02:19:18.138 --> 02:19:20.653
MATT: Welcome back.

2776
02:19:20.653 --> 02:19:22.063
Before we get into the game,

2777
02:19:22.063 --> 02:19:25.124
we do have our winner of the Wyrmwood dice vault

2778
02:19:25.124 --> 02:19:28.435
for the evening. The winner is Stonefoxspqr.

2779
02:19:28.435 --> 02:19:30.996
Stonefox-S-P-Q-R.

2780
02:19:30.996 --> 02:19:32.433
Spqr.

2781
02:19:32.433 --> 02:19:33.522
Congratulations.

2782
02:19:33.522 --> 02:19:34.460
LIAM: Speaker.

2783
02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:38.466
MATT: Yes, could be speaker. I like spqr better.

2784
02:19:38.466 --> 02:19:40.703
MARISHA: Isn't that the Spartan...?

2785
02:19:40.703 --> 02:19:41.536
MATT: Could be.

2786
02:19:41.536 --> 02:19:42.666
LIAM: (silly voice) I dunno.

2787
02:19:42.666 --> 02:19:44.379
MATT: But for now, congratulations.

2788
02:19:44.379 --> 02:19:45.474
LAURA: I dunno.

2789
02:19:45.474 --> 02:19:46.689
(laughter)

2790
02:19:46.689 --> 02:19:48.292
MATT: So.

2791
02:19:48.292 --> 02:19:51.225
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (silly voices) I don't know.

2792
02:19:51.225 --> 02:19:52.863
LAURA: Oh, shit.

2793
02:19:52.863 --> 02:19:54.623
MATT: Yes? Oh shit, what?

2794
02:19:54.623 --> 02:19:58.576
LAURA: I just closed my D&amp;D Beyond. I've got to open it.

2795
02:19:58.576 --> 02:19:59.669
MATT: Reopen it.

2796
02:19:59.669 --> 02:20:00.842
LAURA: I'm doing that!

2797
02:20:00.842 --> 02:20:02.121
TALIESIN: It's not working.

2798
02:20:02.121 --> 02:20:03.350
LIAM: It's not working.

2799
02:20:03.350 --> 02:20:04.650
It's only working for us.

2800
02:20:04.650 --> 02:20:05.988
TALIESIN: No, it's only fun for us.

2801
02:20:05.988 --> 02:20:08.519
It's not fun for anybody else.

2802
02:20:08.519 --> 02:20:09.354
There you go.

2803
02:20:09.354 --> 02:20:11.112
LIAM: (groaning)

2804
02:20:11.112 --> 02:20:12.546
Can't get through.

2805
02:20:12.546 --> 02:20:14.608
TALIESIN: Why, man, why?
MATT: Okay then.

2806
02:20:17.158 --> 02:20:19.723
As you guys gather, now in the mid-afternoon

2807
02:20:19.723 --> 02:20:22.334
here in Nicodranas, you walk your way

2808
02:20:22.334 --> 02:20:25.410
towards the ocean side of the port,

2809
02:20:25.410 --> 02:20:28.396
eventually finding the southern lengths of the city

2810
02:20:28.396 --> 02:20:30.348
that lead into the familiar beaches

2811
02:20:30.348 --> 02:20:34.031
where once you had yourselves a stroll, a soak,

2812
02:20:34.031 --> 02:20:36.020
and a battle with a crab.

2813
02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:38.353
(chuckling)

2814
02:20:39.315 --> 02:20:40.398
MATT: So.
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

2815
02:20:41.277 --> 02:20:44.858
MATT: Coming along the Oceanside, beautiful open sky,

2816
02:20:44.858 --> 02:20:48.224
warm sun heating you up through your clothes.

2817
02:20:48.224 --> 02:20:52.349
You can see now Yeza and Luc both

2818
02:20:52.349 --> 02:20:55.272
just marveling quietly at the sight

2819
02:20:55.272 --> 02:20:57.114
for a moment before Luc goes running off

2820
02:20:57.114 --> 02:20:58.343
towards the water and starts

2821
02:20:58.343 --> 02:20:59.852
jumping in it and splashing.

2822
02:20:59.852 --> 02:21:04.196
SAM: No no no! Not too close! Don't go too far out there.

2823
02:21:04.196 --> 02:21:05.137
MATT: Yeza's like, "It's okay, it's okay.

2824
02:21:05.137 --> 02:21:06.553
"I'm keeping a watch."

2825
02:21:06.553 --> 02:21:07.961
SAM: Okay.

2826
02:21:07.961 --> 02:21:09.552
MATT: "Let him play."

2827
02:21:09.552 --> 02:21:12.276
SAM: All right, while they're playing a little bit,

2828
02:21:12.276 --> 02:21:13.651
I'm going to sort of hang back.

2829
02:21:13.651 --> 02:21:15.339
I'm going to walk over to Caleb.

2830
02:21:15.339 --> 02:21:16.328
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2831
02:21:16.328 --> 02:21:19.802
SAM: Trying to grab him, and psst, you got a second?

2832
02:21:19.802 --> 02:21:21.086
LIAM: I do, one moment.

2833
02:21:21.086 --> 02:21:23.713
And Frumpkin appears down on the sand next to me

2834
02:21:23.713 --> 02:21:27.055
and I skritch his head and say: go, look from where we came.

2835
02:21:27.055 --> 02:21:28.923
Tell me if anyone is coming, okay?

2836
02:21:28.923 --> 02:21:31.125
MATT: (meows)

2837
02:21:31.125 --> 02:21:31.958
LIAM: Yeah?

2838
02:21:31.958 --> 02:21:34.058
SAM: Hey, real quick.

2839
02:21:35.211 --> 02:21:36.578
Real quick.

2840
02:21:38.352 --> 02:21:39.646
This is great, right?

2841
02:21:39.646 --> 02:21:41.588
They're great.

2842
02:21:41.588 --> 02:21:43.367
LIAM: It is.
SAM: This is wonderful.

2843
02:21:43.367 --> 02:21:45.564
MATT: Your illusion is about to drop, by the way.

2844
02:21:45.564 --> 02:21:46.830
SAM: I will recast.

2845
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:48.063
MATT: Okay.

2846
02:21:50.545 --> 02:21:53.107
SAM: (groans and laughs)

2847
02:21:54.174 --> 02:21:55.940
LIAM: Why would you come back with us?

2848
02:21:57.735 --> 02:21:59.243
SAM: I don't know.

2849
02:21:59.243 --> 02:22:00.713
I have no idea.

2850
02:22:00.713 --> 02:22:04.106
I mean, I do, I do have an idea.

2851
02:22:04.106 --> 02:22:07.848
The idea is that I have

2852
02:22:07.848 --> 02:22:09.631
four hours left

2853
02:22:09.631 --> 02:22:13.828
before I pop out of this existence

2854
02:22:13.828 --> 02:22:16.623
and go back to being a goblin.

2855
02:22:16.623 --> 02:22:20.490
LIAM: Your husband, does he know?

2856
02:22:20.490 --> 02:22:21.323
Everything?

2857
02:22:21.323 --> 02:22:24.698
SAM: Does he know that I'm a goblin?

2858
02:22:24.698 --> 02:22:26.115
What do you mean?

2859
02:22:27.726 --> 02:22:29.326
LIAM: I'm sorry, your son.

2860
02:22:29.326 --> 02:22:30.301
Excuse me.
SAM: Oh.

2861
02:22:30.301 --> 02:22:32.837
No, no, I haven't told him.

2862
02:22:32.837 --> 02:22:35.686
LIAM: But your husband has accepted it.

2863
02:22:35.686 --> 02:22:38.981
SAM: I mean, a little.

2864
02:22:38.981 --> 02:22:42.997
He hasn't thrown rocks at me or anything,

2865
02:22:42.997 --> 02:22:46.164
but there's a distance there, I mean--

2866
02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:48.607
LIAM: He didn't seem that distant when you were

2867
02:22:48.607 --> 02:22:49.982
hugging each other.

2868
02:22:49.982 --> 02:22:51.407
SAM: Hugging.

2869
02:22:52.334 --> 02:22:54.417
But we haven't, you know.

2870
02:22:56.690 --> 02:22:58.886
LIAM: What? Oh.

2871
02:22:58.886 --> 02:22:59.811
Well...

2872
02:23:01.109 --> 02:23:05.334
I mean, so just because of that,

2873
02:23:05.334 --> 02:23:08.099
you're going to come back with us and--

2874
02:23:08.099 --> 02:23:10.199
SAM: I mean, listen.

2875
02:23:11.582 --> 02:23:14.168
I don't know if I can leave them right now.

2876
02:23:14.168 --> 02:23:17.506
I haven't been together with them in years,

2877
02:23:17.506 --> 02:23:21.139
and it's everything that I want,

2878
02:23:21.139 --> 02:23:23.030
and I've got it right now,

2879
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:25.382
and they both seem happy and we're safe,

2880
02:23:25.382 --> 02:23:27.824
and that's all that I want.

2881
02:23:27.824 --> 02:23:31.174
But it's not real, right?

2882
02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:37.188
I'm still faking. I don't even look like this.

2883
02:23:38.659 --> 02:23:40.079
LIAM: Do you think you could find the courage

2884
02:23:40.079 --> 02:23:44.304
to show yourself to your son and explain it?

2885
02:23:45.986 --> 02:23:47.986
Because you are real.

2886
02:23:52.283 --> 02:23:53.116
SAM: Maybe.

2887
02:23:55.399 --> 02:23:57.020
LIAM: Would you care for him?

2888
02:23:57.020 --> 02:23:58.928
SAM: What do you mean?

2889
02:23:58.928 --> 02:23:59.923
LIAM: You would be a mother to him, yeah?

2890
02:23:59.923 --> 02:24:01.761
SAM: Of course I would.

2891
02:24:02.694 --> 02:24:05.777
Until he's 25, and then I'll be dead.

2892
02:24:09.442 --> 02:24:13.525
I could maybe convince him that I'm okay for now.

2893
02:24:15.369 --> 02:24:18.460
Maybe he would accept me,

2894
02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:20.876
but I don't know if I would, you know?

2895
02:24:21.948 --> 02:24:25.577
There's still something that's not right about this.

2896
02:24:25.577 --> 02:24:29.067
This is not my body.

2897
02:24:29.067 --> 02:24:30.867
It's just not me.

2898
02:24:31.890 --> 02:24:35.624
And people liking you is nice,

2899
02:24:36.548 --> 02:24:39.298
and people accepting you is nice.

2900
02:24:40.794 --> 02:24:45.258
But if you feel wrong inside your own skin, then,

2901
02:24:45.258 --> 02:24:48.334
well, you can't be a good mother or a good wife,

2902
02:24:48.334 --> 02:24:51.309
or a good anything, really.

2903
02:24:52.428 --> 02:24:56.652
LIAM: Well, what if we

2904
02:24:58.195 --> 02:24:59.853
found a way?

2905
02:25:00.843 --> 02:25:03.182
SAM: Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

2906
02:25:03.182 --> 02:25:05.653
I've been reluctant to talk to you about this before,

2907
02:25:05.653 --> 02:25:07.497
because you know, you're on your own path,

2908
02:25:07.497 --> 02:25:11.993
and I don't want to disrupt it or anything.

2909
02:25:11.993 --> 02:25:16.518
I feel like I've been a bit, not lying,

2910
02:25:16.518 --> 02:25:21.043
but I've just concealed-- when we first met,

2911
02:25:21.043 --> 02:25:23.730
we were there for each other.

2912
02:25:23.730 --> 02:25:27.618
To protect each other, keep us alive.

2913
02:25:27.618 --> 02:25:31.776
But we both had our other motives, too.

2914
02:25:32.995 --> 02:25:36.600
For me, I didn't entirely come clean with you,

2915
02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:40.915
and part of the reason that I was sort of instantly

2916
02:25:40.915 --> 02:25:43.598
interested in hanging out with you

2917
02:25:43.598 --> 02:25:47.459
was because you had these amazing magical abilities,

2918
02:25:47.459 --> 02:25:52.009
and you know, I care for you deeply now,

2919
02:25:52.009 --> 02:25:55.150
and I wouldn't leave your side for anything, but...

2920
02:25:57.392 --> 02:25:58.758
I mean, I love you.

2921
02:26:00.223 --> 02:26:03.802
Back then, anyway, and even now, there's a part of me

2922
02:26:03.802 --> 02:26:08.802
that is hoping that you'll become powerful enough

2923
02:26:09.198 --> 02:26:14.152
to do me a great service, and I haven't

2924
02:26:14.152 --> 02:26:16.439
really been explicit with you about that,

2925
02:26:16.439 --> 02:26:19.899
but I've seen you do amazing things,

2926
02:26:19.899 --> 02:26:22.484
and change things into other things.

2927
02:26:23.501 --> 02:26:28.467
I've also seen you be ruthless when you need to be.

2928
02:26:30.179 --> 02:26:32.762
You know how I became this way.

2929
02:26:33.988 --> 02:26:38.738
They drowned me in water and turned me into another body.

2930
02:26:39.736 --> 02:26:43.643
I was hoping, praying that some day,

2931
02:26:43.643 --> 02:26:47.936
when you're able to learn the spell, find the book,

2932
02:26:47.936 --> 02:26:52.308
whatever it is, that you would be strong enough

2933
02:26:52.308 --> 02:26:57.133
to kill me with fire, and change my body like they did.

2934
02:26:59.273 --> 02:27:01.299
I think you could do it.

2935
02:27:01.299 --> 02:27:03.716
You're very powerful.

2936
02:27:03.716 --> 02:27:04.715
LIAM: Well,

2937
02:27:07.199 --> 02:27:09.965
the fact of the matter is I owe you everything,

2938
02:27:11.108 --> 02:27:13.108
and I would not be here.

2939
02:27:14.121 --> 02:27:19.074
I would be dead in a field outside of Alfield without you.

2940
02:27:19.074 --> 02:27:21.324
And many times over.

2941
02:27:24.764 --> 02:27:25.597
Yeah.

2942
02:27:26.571 --> 02:27:28.515
Anything is possible.

2943
02:27:28.515 --> 02:27:30.709
SAM: Well, but is it, though?

2944
02:27:30.709 --> 02:27:33.126
I kind of need to know.

2945
02:27:34.941 --> 02:27:37.953
I want to say something to my child,

2946
02:27:37.953 --> 02:27:40.147
but I don't want to lie.

2947
02:27:40.147 --> 02:27:42.907
If I tell him that I will be back,

2948
02:27:42.907 --> 02:27:47.060
I need to know that it is truly possible.

2949
02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:50.477
Is that something that you can do for me?

2950
02:27:52.053 --> 02:27:53.336
LIAM: Not now,

2951
02:27:54.934 --> 02:27:58.017
but I am on the edges of such things.

2952
02:27:59.199 --> 02:28:00.124
SAM: You could

2953
02:28:01.807 --> 02:28:04.478
kill me and bring me back?

2954
02:28:04.478 --> 02:28:06.266
LIAM: You want to be you.

2955
02:28:06.266 --> 02:28:07.549
SAM: Yes.

2956
02:28:09.439 --> 02:28:13.551
LIAM: We can find a way to make you, you.

2957
02:28:13.551 --> 02:28:18.551
But nothing comes without risk or hard work,

2958
02:28:18.573 --> 02:28:22.064
and I cannot do it tomorrow, and I need

2959
02:28:23.598 --> 02:28:24.431
books.

2960
02:28:25.487 --> 02:28:28.320
MARISHA: (quietly laughs)

2961
02:28:30.525 --> 02:28:31.525
SAM: All right.

2962
02:28:33.307 --> 02:28:37.779
LIAM: But if you're asking me if I will help you,

2963
02:28:37.779 --> 02:28:40.564
of course I will help you.

2964
02:28:40.564 --> 02:28:44.950
SAM: And that's a spell that you've heard of,

2965
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:48.109
or know is possible?

2966
02:28:48.109 --> 02:28:50.484
MATT: Make an Arcana check, if you like.

2967
02:28:52.616 --> 02:28:53.783
LIAM: Total balls.

2968
02:28:55.399 --> 02:28:56.342
Well, 13.

2969
02:28:56.342 --> 02:28:58.325
MATT: 13.
SAM: That's pretty good.

2970
02:28:58.325 --> 02:28:59.441
TALIESIN: A ball.

2971
02:29:00.669 --> 02:29:05.344
MATT: Transmutation is an interesting school, as you know,

2972
02:29:05.344 --> 02:29:07.761
as it is what drew you to it.

2973
02:29:09.296 --> 02:29:11.985
What Nott is talking about sits more in the realm

2974
02:29:11.985 --> 02:29:13.752
of necromancy.

2975
02:29:14.948 --> 02:29:17.427
If there are means of transmutation,

2976
02:29:17.427 --> 02:29:22.252
of permanently, you know, changing one body into another,

2977
02:29:23.277 --> 02:29:26.481
you have no knowledge of that.

2978
02:29:26.481 --> 02:29:31.481
You would have to ask magic practitioners

2979
02:29:31.513 --> 02:29:34.337
of a much higher experience level,

2980
02:29:34.337 --> 02:29:36.580
or research in places that have

2981
02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:38.146
much larger

2982
02:29:41.922 --> 02:29:44.513
caches of older magic study.

2983
02:29:44.513 --> 02:29:45.858
LIAM: Question, though.
MATT: Yes.

2984
02:29:45.858 --> 02:29:49.502
LIAM: I'm unfamiliar of any way to do what she is asking.

2985
02:29:49.502 --> 02:29:51.021
MATT: Correct.

2986
02:29:51.021 --> 02:29:54.359
LIAM: But I have read a ton, and I've read legends,

2987
02:29:54.359 --> 02:29:57.075
and stories and history

2988
02:29:58.026 --> 02:30:00.876
about people doing the unthinkable,

2989
02:30:00.876 --> 02:30:02.196
destroying themselves in the process.

2990
02:30:02.196 --> 02:30:04.869
MATT: You don't doubt that it's possible.

2991
02:30:04.869 --> 02:30:06.113
You just don't know specifically--

2992
02:30:06.113 --> 02:30:08.058
LIAM: Don't know of-- right.

2993
02:30:08.058 --> 02:30:08.891
MATT: --what can do it.

2994
02:30:08.891 --> 02:30:11.659
LIAM: But I would think that with everything that I have

2995
02:30:11.659 --> 02:30:15.730
done and read and know, that I have seen threads branching

2996
02:30:15.730 --> 02:30:20.309
out into other schools, and into other spells

2997
02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:24.634
that logically, taken to the horizon,

2998
02:30:25.514 --> 02:30:28.632
would be able to achieve something like what she wants.

2999
02:30:28.632 --> 02:30:30.199
Improbable, yeah.

3000
02:30:30.199 --> 02:30:31.188
MATT: It's possible,

3001
02:30:31.188 --> 02:30:32.909
but like I said, there are different paths.

3002
02:30:32.909 --> 02:30:36.972
There are asking around for other mages

3003
02:30:36.972 --> 02:30:39.141
that are more powerful than yourself,

3004
02:30:39.141 --> 02:30:41.986
that may have more experience or knowledge on the topic,

3005
02:30:41.986 --> 02:30:44.216
or, like a lot of spells are developed,

3006
02:30:44.216 --> 02:30:48.299
if something doesn't exist to fit what you need,

3007
02:30:50.032 --> 02:30:51.648
develop it.

3008
02:30:51.648 --> 02:30:54.958
You know, that's how many spells were designed.

3009
02:30:54.958 --> 02:30:57.291
There are different avenues to pursue such a thing,

3010
02:30:57.291 --> 02:31:01.533
and you know that, but that's as much as you can ascertain.

3011
02:31:06.872 --> 02:31:09.122
LIAM: I don't want to burn you.

3012
02:31:12.350 --> 02:31:15.887
But if we follow the road long enough,

3013
02:31:15.887 --> 02:31:18.170
I think I could return you.

3014
02:31:20.128 --> 02:31:23.978
SAM: I have no doubt that you can do anything.

3015
02:31:26.766 --> 02:31:30.471
But how long do you think that road is?

3016
02:31:30.471 --> 02:31:35.471
Is it something that is hypothetical, or real?

3017
02:31:35.570 --> 02:31:37.653
LIAM: Veth, I do not know.

3018
02:31:39.087 --> 02:31:40.871
I do not know if we are going to be alive

3019
02:31:40.871 --> 02:31:42.346
two weeks from now.

3020
02:31:42.346 --> 02:31:44.681
So it is a very personal choice for to you make,

3021
02:31:44.681 --> 02:31:47.735
because maybe you would prefer to have

3022
02:31:47.735 --> 02:31:50.735
20 years with your boy.

3023
02:31:50.735 --> 02:31:53.584
Or struggle into the unknown for a while

3024
02:31:53.584 --> 02:31:56.235
and see what it gets you.

3025
02:31:56.235 --> 02:31:57.606
Maybe die sooner.

3026
02:31:57.606 --> 02:31:58.689
I don't know.

3027
02:31:59.764 --> 02:32:01.872
All I can give you is my

3028
02:32:04.539 --> 02:32:05.764
loyalty.

3029
02:32:06.806 --> 02:32:09.989
And I have great loyalty for you.

3030
02:32:13.019 --> 02:32:14.052
SAM: All right.

3031
02:32:14.052 --> 02:32:15.085
LIAM: And

3032
02:32:18.031 --> 02:32:22.714
I'd hate to see you go, but that's selfish.

3033
02:32:29.092 --> 02:32:32.925
SAM: All right, well, thank you for your honesty.

3034
02:32:35.405 --> 02:32:37.072
I'll think about it.

3035
02:32:38.879 --> 02:32:42.937
LIAM: I promise to do all I can, if you want me to.

3036
02:32:45.295 --> 02:32:46.295
SAM: Thank you.

3037
02:32:49.311 --> 02:32:50.144
Thank you.

3038
02:32:52.655 --> 02:32:55.910
I'll walk back over to the boy.

3039
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:58.814
MATT: Okay, you look over and he is currently

3040
02:32:58.814 --> 02:33:00.152
smashing some sort of hermit crab

3041
02:33:00.152 --> 02:33:01.794
with the grappling hook against a rock.

3042
02:33:01.794 --> 02:33:05.512
Just like (crunching) and Yeza's like, "Oh! (sighs)"

3043
02:33:05.512 --> 02:33:06.345
LIAM: Chip off the old block.

3044
02:33:06.345 --> 02:33:08.397
MATT: "Just be careful!"

3045
02:33:08.397 --> 02:33:10.590
SAM: It's okay. He'll be fine.

3046
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:11.740
MATT: Okay.

3047
02:33:12.593 --> 02:33:14.495
Anybody else doing anything in particular

3048
02:33:14.495 --> 02:33:15.845
during your beach trip?

3049
02:33:15.845 --> 02:33:18.292
TALIESIN: I'm just watching Fjord.

3050
02:33:18.292 --> 02:33:19.557
SAM: Oh, yeah.

3051
02:33:19.557 --> 02:33:21.897
Is he swimming out to sea?

3052
02:33:21.897 --> 02:33:25.102
MATT: (chuckles) Fjord, what are you doing?

3053
02:33:25.102 --> 02:33:27.066
TRAVIS: I'm just hanging out.

3054
02:33:27.066 --> 02:33:28.754
LAURA: That's it?

3055
02:33:28.754 --> 02:33:29.704
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3056
02:33:29.704 --> 02:33:33.082
LAURA: You don't seem weird around the water

3057
02:33:33.082 --> 02:33:34.995
or anything like that?

3058
02:33:34.995 --> 02:33:37.600
TRAVIS: I've been around the water a lot.

3059
02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:38.746
LAURA: Yeah, but not since, you know.

3060
02:33:38.746 --> 02:33:40.479
TALIESIN: (like Uk'otoa) Fjord.

3061
02:33:43.004 --> 02:33:45.069
MARISHA: This conch shell is crazy.

3062
02:33:45.069 --> 02:33:46.436
It keeps saying "Fjord."

3063
02:33:46.436 --> 02:33:47.377
(laughter)

3064
02:33:47.377 --> 02:33:48.919
SAM: Mine says "consume."

3065
02:33:48.919 --> 02:33:53.460
(laughter)

3066
02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:55.293
MATT: Gotta catch 'em all.

3067
02:33:56.561 --> 02:33:58.265
LIAM: (like Uk'otoa) Fjord.

3068
02:33:58.265 --> 02:33:59.540
TALIESIN: (like Uk'otoa) Fjord.

3069
02:34:00.421 --> 02:34:02.204
MATT: Fjord just putting seashells into his chest.

3070
02:34:02.204 --> 02:34:05.774
(laughter)

3071
02:34:05.774 --> 02:34:07.074
MATT: All right, yeah.

3072
02:34:07.074 --> 02:34:09.475
From your standpoint, Fjord is just lounging

3073
02:34:09.475 --> 02:34:12.414
and enjoying the atmosphere,

3074
02:34:12.414 --> 02:34:13.969
being back by the ocean.

3075
02:34:13.969 --> 02:34:15.386
TALIESIN: I'm going to collect some shells.

3076
02:34:15.386 --> 02:34:16.219
MATT: Okay.

3077
02:34:16.219 --> 02:34:18.483
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to take a show

3078
02:34:18.483 --> 02:34:20.663
and then we can call it a night.

3079
02:34:20.663 --> 02:34:22.525
MATT: Okay.

3080
02:34:22.525 --> 02:34:27.319
You guys return. There looks to be a traveling troupe

3081
02:34:27.319 --> 02:34:30.192
of performers that make their way through the streets.

3082
02:34:30.192 --> 02:34:32.456
It's a slow procession, people and families

3083
02:34:32.456 --> 02:34:34.771
and merchants and businessmen and nobles

3084
02:34:34.771 --> 02:34:35.878
all come out and watch them

3085
02:34:35.878 --> 02:34:37.881
as they guide their way towards

3086
02:34:37.881 --> 02:34:39.171
the center of the Opal Archway.

3087
02:34:39.171 --> 02:34:40.954
Not directly in front of the Lavish Chateau,

3088
02:34:40.954 --> 02:34:42.639
but not too far away.

3089
02:34:42.639 --> 02:34:44.739
The music carries on through the evening,

3090
02:34:44.739 --> 02:34:48.089
and it's an enjoyable night of simple performances,

3091
02:34:48.089 --> 02:34:49.857
nothing too wild, especially given

3092
02:34:49.857 --> 02:34:50.983
some of the shows that you've seen,

3093
02:34:50.983 --> 02:34:52.957
especially after going to Hupperdook,

3094
02:34:52.957 --> 02:34:56.063
it's a hard basis of comparison.

3095
02:34:56.063 --> 02:34:59.972
It's a fine evening of celebration

3096
02:34:59.972 --> 02:35:04.166
for the tiny victories and

3097
02:35:04.166 --> 02:35:08.493
the long breath before the next leg of your journey.

3098
02:35:08.493 --> 02:35:09.733
So.

3099
02:35:09.733 --> 02:35:13.749
LAURA: Can I go inside and talk to Bluud

3100
02:35:13.749 --> 02:35:14.865
and my mom for a minute?

3101
02:35:14.865 --> 02:35:16.519
MATT: Of course, yeah.

3102
02:35:16.519 --> 02:35:20.021
During the celebration, everyone taking in

3103
02:35:20.021 --> 02:35:21.930
the sights and the colors and lights

3104
02:35:21.930 --> 02:35:26.499
and the manner of spiraling firecrackers and laughter,

3105
02:35:26.499 --> 02:35:29.039
you sneak off towards the Lavish Chateau

3106
02:35:29.039 --> 02:35:30.572
and make your way back up.

3107
02:35:30.572 --> 02:35:33.138
Bluud steps aside and allows you into Marion's chamber,

3108
02:35:33.138 --> 02:35:37.113
where she's out on the balcony watching everything

3109
02:35:37.113 --> 02:35:39.333
on her accord, and hears you enter and turns

3110
02:35:39.333 --> 02:35:42.331
and she goes, "Jester!"

3111
02:35:42.331 --> 02:35:45.491
and she walks up and gives you another hug.

3112
02:35:45.491 --> 02:35:46.480
LAURA: Hi Mama.

3113
02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:48.214
MATT: "Hello.

3114
02:35:48.214 --> 02:35:50.847
"How are you doing?"

3115
02:35:50.847 --> 02:35:53.482
LAURA: I'm doing pretty good.

3116
02:35:53.482 --> 02:35:56.132
You know, it's hard being out

3117
02:35:56.132 --> 02:35:58.049
in the world and stuff.

3118
02:35:59.011 --> 02:36:03.094
MATT: "It's a hard world out there, that is very true."

3119
02:36:04.707 --> 02:36:05.923
LAURA: Yeah.

3120
02:36:08.755 --> 02:36:11.853
Yeah, sometimes I wonder if maybe I should just come here

3121
02:36:11.853 --> 02:36:14.637
and live with you and just give it all up

3122
02:36:14.637 --> 02:36:17.720
and not have to deal with it anymore.

3123
02:36:18.730 --> 02:36:23.328
MATT: "I mean, selfishly I would love that,

3124
02:36:23.328 --> 02:36:28.312
"but I do not think that it's yet safe."

3125
02:36:32.285 --> 02:36:33.126
LAURA: I know.

3126
02:36:33.126 --> 02:36:35.956
MATT: "Lord Sharp is still very much a prick."

3127
02:36:35.956 --> 02:36:37.328
(laughs)

3128
02:36:37.328 --> 02:36:39.304
LAURA: Have you seen him lately?

3129
02:36:39.304 --> 02:36:42.971
MATT: "He is no longer a recurring client of mine,

3130
02:36:44.139 --> 02:36:47.998
"and I prefer it that way.

3131
02:36:47.998 --> 02:36:50.150
"But I just want to know that you're safe.

3132
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:53.791
"And, well,

3133
02:36:55.373 --> 02:36:58.825
"if I can be so bold, can I ask you to tell me

3134
02:36:58.825 --> 02:37:01.325
"about some of your adventures?"

3135
02:37:03.250 --> 02:37:05.083
LAURA: Of course.

3136
02:37:05.083 --> 02:37:09.491
I sit her down and I just tell her everything.

3137
02:37:09.491 --> 02:37:11.179
I tell her about the giant roc

3138
02:37:11.179 --> 02:37:13.312
and what it looked like and how big it was,

3139
02:37:13.312 --> 02:37:16.471
and I tell her about the cavern of crystals,

3140
02:37:16.471 --> 02:37:18.608
it's really pretty.

3141
02:37:18.608 --> 02:37:20.112
(chuckling)

3142
02:37:20.112 --> 02:37:22.145
I tell her about the bridge, the crazy bridge

3143
02:37:22.145 --> 02:37:23.804
with all the voices.

3144
02:37:25.230 --> 02:37:30.230
And I tell her about Yasha and what happened.

3145
02:37:30.547 --> 02:37:34.214
MATT: She holds your hand for that story.

3146
02:37:35.161 --> 02:37:39.742
LAURA: I also tell her in detail about Astrid,

3147
02:37:39.742 --> 02:37:44.742
as much as I know, and what to be aware of and

3148
02:37:45.325 --> 02:37:46.891
look for.

3149
02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:52.013
You know, I'm just a little worried

3150
02:37:52.013 --> 02:37:55.413
that we've put you in danger now, Mama.

3151
02:37:56.672 --> 02:37:59.222
MATT: "I appreciate that.

3152
02:38:00.985 --> 02:38:05.351
"You know, living in Nicodranas,

3153
02:38:05.351 --> 02:38:07.076
"a place where

3154
02:38:07.076 --> 02:38:11.259
"so many people come and go from all walks of life,

3155
02:38:11.259 --> 02:38:15.464
"it can be a beautiful and equally dangerous place,

3156
02:38:15.464 --> 02:38:18.797
"as you know. (chuckles)

3157
02:38:20.186 --> 02:38:24.348
"I'm careful, but I will be more careful.

3158
02:38:24.348 --> 02:38:25.695
LAURA: Okay.

3159
02:38:25.695 --> 02:38:30.042
MATT: "But I also do not want to live my life in fear.

3160
02:38:30.042 --> 02:38:31.125
"I trust Bluud,

3161
02:38:31.125 --> 02:38:35.843
"I trust all of my compatriots

3162
02:38:35.843 --> 02:38:38.289
"here at the Chateau.

3163
02:38:38.289 --> 02:38:42.049
"And to be fair, and not to toot my own horn,

3164
02:38:42.049 --> 02:38:45.038
"there are many people that would wish to see

3165
02:38:45.038 --> 02:38:47.536
"no harm come to me as well. (chuckles)"

3166
02:38:47.536 --> 02:38:48.668
LAURA: That's the truth.

3167
02:38:48.668 --> 02:38:51.076
Lots of people love you, Mama, not just me.

3168
02:38:51.076 --> 02:38:53.414
MATT: "I know.

3169
02:38:53.414 --> 02:38:58.331
"So I will take care, and I appreciate you worrying for me.

3170
02:38:59.592 --> 02:39:02.565
"But I worry about you, too."

3171
02:39:02.565 --> 02:39:05.065
LAURA: I'm fine, everything's fine.

3172
02:39:06.104 --> 02:39:10.436
MATT: "I know that voice. (chuckles)

3173
02:39:10.436 --> 02:39:15.436
"And the times where it's not fine, that's okay, too.

3174
02:39:15.507 --> 02:39:17.868
"You know?

3175
02:39:17.868 --> 02:39:20.785
"If I can't be there to console you,

3176
02:39:21.668 --> 02:39:25.581
"you surrounded yourself with some wonderful people.

3177
02:39:25.581 --> 02:39:28.914
"Don't be afraid to lean on them as well."

3178
02:39:30.201 --> 02:39:31.034
LAURA: Yeah.

3179
02:39:33.322 --> 02:39:36.078
Has a package come for us?

3180
02:39:36.078 --> 02:39:38.233
MATT: "A package?"

3181
02:39:38.233 --> 02:39:41.752
LAURA: Yeah, there was a package that was going to Zadash

3182
02:39:41.752 --> 02:39:44.801
and then we forwarded it to here.

3183
02:39:44.801 --> 02:39:47.199
MATT: "It has not arrived yet.

3184
02:39:47.199 --> 02:39:49.282
"I can go check real fast."

3185
02:39:50.121 --> 02:39:53.767
LAURA: Oh, I'll go see if Bluud can check, okay?

3186
02:39:53.767 --> 02:39:54.976
I will do it, okay.

3187
02:39:54.976 --> 02:39:58.685
I go outside and ask Bluud to go look for the package,

3188
02:39:58.685 --> 02:40:00.952
and I also tell Bluud all about what Astrid looks like

3189
02:40:00.952 --> 02:40:04.262
and tell him to really look out for her.

3190
02:40:04.262 --> 02:40:05.828
MATT: The massive minotaur,

3191
02:40:05.828 --> 02:40:07.725
through the intensity in your voice

3192
02:40:07.725 --> 02:40:11.640
and your expression, seems to somewhat dwindle

3193
02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:14.524
ever so slightly and nod in acknowledgement.

3194
02:40:14.524 --> 02:40:18.411
"All right, I'll keep an eye out."

3195
02:40:18.411 --> 02:40:21.787
LAURA: But also, is the package here?

3196
02:40:21.787 --> 02:40:23.620
MATT: You go ahead and ask him about the package,

3197
02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:25.511
which I will go grab, actually.

3198
02:40:25.511 --> 02:40:26.844
SAM and TALIESIN: What?!

3199
02:40:28.567 --> 02:40:29.599
MARISHA: What was this again?

3200
02:40:29.599 --> 02:40:31.027
LIAM: It's from--

3201
02:40:31.027 --> 02:40:36.027
SAM: This package is brought to you by Dwarven Forge, maybe?

3202
02:40:36.315 --> 02:40:38.420
Maybe it's brought to you by Dwarven Forge?

3203
02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:40.069
Their Dungeon of Doom was nominated

3204
02:40:40.069 --> 02:40:42.107
for an ENnie Award at Gen Con.

3205
02:40:42.107 --> 02:40:45.664
Go vote at at bit.ly/voteDOD.

3206
02:40:45.664 --> 02:40:47.476
TALIESIN: What?

3207
02:40:47.476 --> 02:40:49.545
What is this madness?

3208
02:40:49.545 --> 02:40:50.578
LAURA: Is this from Calianna?

3209
02:40:50.578 --> 02:40:52.077
Is this the package from Calianna?

3210
02:40:52.077 --> 02:40:53.155
MATT: Yes, it is.

3211
02:40:53.155 --> 02:40:57.823
There are letters to Jester and the Mighty Nein,

3212
02:40:57.823 --> 02:40:59.335
and to Mr. Caleb.

3213
02:40:59.335 --> 02:41:01.601
MARISHA: Whoa, there's been a backup in mail.

3214
02:41:01.601 --> 02:41:02.917
SAM: Do you want us to read it, Laura?

3215
02:41:02.917 --> 02:41:03.964
LIAM: Here you go, here's yours.

3216
02:41:03.964 --> 02:41:05.102
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3217
02:41:05.102 --> 02:41:07.513
(laughter)

3218
02:41:07.513 --> 02:41:09.346
SAM: Gimme that.

3219
02:41:09.346 --> 02:41:12.064
LIAM: Do you want the table to read it for you?

3220
02:41:12.064 --> 02:41:13.005
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

3221
02:41:13.005 --> 02:41:14.733
MATT: As well as this.

3222
02:41:14.733 --> 02:41:16.188
ALL: Ooh.

3223
02:41:16.188 --> 02:41:17.804
LIAM: Who's this for?
LAURA: Whoa!

3224
02:41:17.804 --> 02:41:22.254
MARISHA: It matches the dress Beau's wearing.

3225
02:41:22.254 --> 02:41:23.974
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

3226
02:41:23.974 --> 02:41:25.398
Are you like in--

3227
02:41:25.398 --> 02:41:26.772
MARISHA: I'm still in that red poof.

3228
02:41:26.772 --> 02:41:27.605
TALIESIN: Okay.

3229
02:41:27.605 --> 02:41:32.433
SAM: Holy bejesus, it's a three-page, four-page letter.

3230
02:41:32.433 --> 02:41:33.454
TALIESIN: Wow.

3231
02:41:33.454 --> 02:41:34.848
MARISHA: Oh, dang!

3232
02:41:34.848 --> 02:41:36.285
LAURA: Okay, well maybe just save it for me.

3233
02:41:36.285 --> 02:41:38.094
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

3234
02:41:38.094 --> 02:41:39.177
LAURA: Okay, okay.

3235
02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:43.798
TALIESIN: Share, share.

3236
02:41:43.798 --> 02:41:45.774
LIAM: So there's presents.

3237
02:41:45.774 --> 02:41:47.154
TALIESIN: Oh my god, what?

3238
02:41:47.154 --> 02:41:48.792
LIAM: There are presents here.

3239
02:41:48.792 --> 02:41:51.558
She misspelled your name, but this is for you, Nott.

3240
02:41:51.558 --> 02:41:54.883
SAM: Oh, thank you, Calianna.

3241
02:41:54.883 --> 02:41:57.124
LIAM: This is for me. What is this?

3242
02:41:57.124 --> 02:41:57.957
Oh dear.

3243
02:41:57.957 --> 02:41:59.124
SAM: It's a wand?

3244
02:42:00.022 --> 02:42:00.855
LIAM: Oh dear.

3245
02:42:00.855 --> 02:42:01.988
SAM: Did you break it?

3246
02:42:01.988 --> 02:42:02.821
LIAM: No.

3247
02:42:02.821 --> 02:42:05.085
There is something for Mollymauk.

3248
02:42:05.085 --> 02:42:07.204
LAURA: Sam, I mean Nott, I mean Sam.

3249
02:42:07.204 --> 02:42:08.053
SAM: What?

3250
02:42:08.053 --> 02:42:11.003
LAURA: Take pictures of the letter and text it to me.

3251
02:42:11.003 --> 02:42:13.086
SAM: Great idea, great idea.

3252
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:16.736
MARISHA: What's the gift for Mollymauk?

3253
02:42:16.736 --> 02:42:19.411
LIAM: Something for Fjord, so here you are.

3254
02:42:19.411 --> 02:42:21.661
(laughter)

3255
02:42:22.748 --> 02:42:26.317
This one is for you, Jester, here you go.

3256
02:42:26.317 --> 02:42:29.611
This is for you, Beauregard.

3257
02:42:29.611 --> 02:42:30.966
MARISHA: It's a bow.

3258
02:42:30.966 --> 02:42:32.772
SAM: For Beauregard, get it?

3259
02:42:32.772 --> 02:42:37.231
TALIESIN: Oh, that's very cute.

3260
02:42:37.231 --> 02:42:39.064
MARISHA: It is very cute.

3261
02:42:39.064 --> 02:42:41.877
TALIESIN: Oh my god, it's adorable.

3262
02:42:41.877 --> 02:42:43.688
MARISHA: Thanks, Caduceus.

3263
02:42:43.688 --> 02:42:44.999
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's just adorable.

3264
02:42:44.999 --> 02:42:45.860
LIAM: Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah?

3265
02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:48.136
LIAM: I'm not quite ready for this.

3266
02:42:48.136 --> 02:42:51.695
Are any of these things magical?

3267
02:42:51.695 --> 02:42:52.945
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.

3268
02:42:54.370 --> 02:42:55.837
MATT: That's a good question.

3269
02:42:55.837 --> 02:42:57.682
TALIESIN: (laughs)

3270
02:42:57.682 --> 02:42:59.231
MATT: I will...

3271
02:42:59.231 --> 02:43:04.231
LIAM: This is for Yasha. Do you want to hold onto that this?

3272
02:43:04.438 --> 02:43:06.384
TRAVIS: You can throw that in the refuse.

3273
02:43:06.384 --> 02:43:08.458
(laughter)

3274
02:43:08.458 --> 02:43:09.666
TALIESIN: Wow, already.

3275
02:43:09.666 --> 02:43:11.999
MATT: (chuckling)

3276
02:43:13.214 --> 02:43:14.631
Let's see here.

3277
02:43:18.859 --> 02:43:23.266
MARISHA: Forgot how much of a girly-girl Calianna was.

3278
02:43:24.316 --> 02:43:26.832
MATT: I don't believe any of these are magical.

3279
02:43:26.832 --> 02:43:28.536
I think they're just a series of gifts.

3280
02:43:28.536 --> 02:43:32.077
I'll confer with, it's a wand, it's a focus.

3281
02:43:32.077 --> 02:43:33.310
LIAM: Focus.

3282
02:43:33.310 --> 02:43:34.685
MATT: I'll confer and double-check,

3283
02:43:34.685 --> 02:43:35.701
but pretty sure they aren't.

3284
02:43:35.701 --> 02:43:36.676
LIAM: This is for Mollymauk,

3285
02:43:36.676 --> 02:43:38.634
you should hold onto it as well.

3286
02:43:41.466 --> 02:43:45.299
MARISHA: Cool, I get a bow and a dead friend's gifts.

3287
02:43:49.156 --> 02:43:51.323
TALIESIN: You should wear the bow.

3288
02:43:53.862 --> 02:43:56.266
That's right, that's right, just let it happen.

3289
02:43:56.266 --> 02:43:57.631
(laughter)

3290
02:43:57.631 --> 02:44:02.109
LIAM: I slide these little pink flowers behind Nott's ear.

3291
02:44:02.109 --> 02:44:02.942
SAM: Oh.

3292
02:44:07.031 --> 02:44:08.927
MARISHA: Am I doing it right, Caduceus?

3293
02:44:08.927 --> 02:44:09.819
TALIESIN: I don't know.

3294
02:44:09.819 --> 02:44:11.215
MARISHA: Caduceus, help me.

3295
02:44:11.215 --> 02:44:14.621
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah, hold on, I gotcha.

3296
02:44:14.621 --> 02:44:16.775
LIAM: You totally gave us stuff like this at home, though.

3297
02:44:16.775 --> 02:44:17.609
MATT: Oh yeah.

3298
02:44:17.609 --> 02:44:18.650
TALIESIN: All the time.

3299
02:44:18.650 --> 02:44:20.482
SAM: There's perfume on the letter.

3300
02:44:20.482 --> 02:44:23.315
MARISHA: I told you she was a girly-girl!

3301
02:44:25.004 --> 02:44:25.837
TALIESIN: I'm going to make sure this is

3302
02:44:25.837 --> 02:44:27.237
really hard to untie,

3303
02:44:27.237 --> 02:44:29.878
and I'm going to get as much of your hair in it as possible.

3304
02:44:29.878 --> 02:44:30.867
There we go.

3305
02:44:30.867 --> 02:44:33.584
(laughter)

3306
02:44:33.584 --> 02:44:35.666
LAURA: Did you text it to me, Sam?

3307
02:44:35.666 --> 02:44:36.996
SAM: It's big files.

3308
02:44:36.996 --> 02:44:38.404
They're coming.

3309
02:44:38.404 --> 02:44:40.737
TALIESIN: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3310
02:44:42.844 --> 02:44:45.014
LIAM: Hey guys, want me to open your pressies for you

3311
02:44:45.014 --> 02:44:46.766
and hold them up?

3312
02:44:46.766 --> 02:44:48.728
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

3313
02:44:48.728 --> 02:44:50.669
I'll get to my letter in a second.

3314
02:44:50.669 --> 02:44:53.442
TALIESIN: Here, just enjoy this as much as I'm enjoying it.

3315
02:44:53.442 --> 02:44:56.153
(laughter)

3316
02:44:56.153 --> 02:44:57.227
MATT: That's pretty great.

3317
02:44:57.227 --> 02:44:58.178
TALIESIN: Oh man.

3318
02:44:58.178 --> 02:44:59.844
LIAM: (like Jester) So you know,

3319
02:44:59.844 --> 02:45:02.110
Jester opened up her present,

3320
02:45:02.110 --> 02:45:05.338
and it's a little lollipop on a chain.

3321
02:45:05.338 --> 02:45:07.450
LAURA: (gasps) Is it?

3322
02:45:07.450 --> 02:45:08.633
MARISHA: Oh!

3323
02:45:08.633 --> 02:45:09.950
MATT: That's really cute.

3324
02:45:09.950 --> 02:45:10.786
MARISHA: Cute!

3325
02:45:10.786 --> 02:45:11.869
LIAM: (like Jester) That's nice!

3326
02:45:11.869 --> 02:45:13.602
LAURA: That is so cute!

3327
02:45:13.602 --> 02:45:15.449
MARISHA: Not as cute as my bow.

3328
02:45:15.449 --> 02:45:17.726
TALIESIN: Ah! I get it now.

3329
02:45:17.726 --> 02:45:19.152
That's funny.

3330
02:45:19.152 --> 02:45:21.435
LIAM: (like Fjord) Then Fjord's

3331
02:45:21.435 --> 02:45:25.234
got a bunch of shit in a bag,

3332
02:45:25.234 --> 02:45:26.740
what is this?

3333
02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:27.665
TALIESIN: Took me a sec.

3334
02:45:27.665 --> 02:45:29.603
LIAM: (like Fjord) What is all this stuff?

3335
02:45:29.603 --> 02:45:32.318
Shit, I don't know what it is, it's pot-purry.

3336
02:45:32.318 --> 02:45:33.462
SAM: It's potpourri.

3337
02:45:33.462 --> 02:45:35.945
TALIESIN: Pot-purry.

3338
02:45:35.945 --> 02:45:37.166
LIAM: Yeah, that's what that is, pot-purry.

3339
02:45:37.166 --> 02:45:38.277
TRAVIS: I got potpourri?

3340
02:45:38.277 --> 02:45:39.873
TALIESIN: It's pot-purry.
LIAM: Yep.

3341
02:45:39.873 --> 02:45:42.791
TRAVIS: It's not like a teabag, it's fucking potpourri?

3342
02:45:42.791 --> 02:45:45.140
TALIESIN: I genuinely don't know what's happening there.

3343
02:45:45.140 --> 02:45:46.743
SAM: Calianna knows you so well.

3344
02:45:46.743 --> 02:45:49.011
(laughter)

3345
02:45:49.011 --> 02:45:51.855
TRAVIS: I got a bag of smell-good shit?

3346
02:45:51.855 --> 02:45:53.930
TALIESIN: I mean, maybe. (laughs)

3347
02:45:53.930 --> 02:45:55.618
LIAM: (like Fjord) Here's some little silver balls.

3348
02:45:55.618 --> 02:45:57.228
I feel like eating 'em, maybe.

3349
02:45:57.228 --> 02:45:59.478
(laughter)

3350
02:46:00.361 --> 02:46:02.266
I'm not sure, pot-purry.

3351
02:46:02.266 --> 02:46:04.516
(laughter)

3352
02:46:05.763 --> 02:46:08.510
TALIESIN: That was the weirdest--
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that stuff?

3353
02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:09.545
LAURA: That's so cool.

3354
02:46:09.545 --> 02:46:12.158
MARISHA: Is all of this explained in her letter?

3355
02:46:12.158 --> 02:46:13.355
TRAVIS: Is that human skin?

3356
02:46:13.355 --> 02:46:14.679
LAURA: I bet, yes.

3357
02:46:14.679 --> 02:46:16.037
TALIESIN: The short letter, not the long letter.

3358
02:46:16.037 --> 02:46:17.620
MARISHA: Do the short one.

3359
02:46:19.183 --> 02:46:21.923
SAM: I got a little bracelet.

3360
02:46:21.923 --> 02:46:24.443
MARISHA: Oh, you look like a beach-goer now.

3361
02:46:24.443 --> 02:46:25.937
This is great.

3362
02:46:25.937 --> 02:46:28.769
(chuckling)

3363
02:46:28.769 --> 02:46:30.097
TALIESIN: Wow, okay.

3364
02:46:30.097 --> 02:46:30.930
Wow.
SAM: Long letter.

3365
02:46:30.930 --> 02:46:33.263
TRAVIS: Are we opening all this stuff down on the shore?

3366
02:46:33.263 --> 02:46:34.546
LAURA: Yeah.

3367
02:46:34.546 --> 02:46:37.165
No no no, we're outside where the troupe was.

3368
02:46:37.165 --> 02:46:38.483
MATT: Yeah, this is when you guys start coming back in

3369
02:46:38.483 --> 02:46:41.589
from the performance troupe has passed on.

3370
02:46:41.589 --> 02:46:43.922
So this is an evening event.

3371
02:46:45.891 --> 02:46:47.483
TALIESIN: Would you like help removing that?

3372
02:46:47.483 --> 02:46:50.062
MARISHA: I feel like I'm auditioning for Steel Magnolias.

3373
02:46:50.062 --> 02:46:52.350
(laughter)

3374
02:46:52.350 --> 02:46:54.195
Get it out of my hair, Caduceus.

3375
02:46:54.195 --> 02:46:55.990
TALIESIN: Hold on, hold on.
MARISHA: It's pinching!

3376
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:58.465
MATT: It's got a very

3377
02:46:58.465 --> 02:47:00.556
"Gonna Wash That Man Out of My Hair" vibe.

3378
02:47:00.556 --> 02:47:02.555
LIAM: Yeah, I will read this letter.

3379
02:47:02.555 --> 02:47:03.396
MATT: All right.

3380
02:47:03.396 --> 02:47:06.379
LIAM: It is fairly short, and it's kind.

3381
02:47:06.379 --> 02:47:08.179
(reading) Dear Mr. Caleb,

3382
02:47:08.179 --> 02:47:09.445
I wanted to write something for you

3383
02:47:09.445 --> 02:47:11.397
because I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to you

3384
02:47:11.397 --> 02:47:13.700
when I left the swamp.

3385
02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:16.421
I wanted to say thank you for helping me,

3386
02:47:16.421 --> 02:47:19.721
for trying to reassure me and be nice to me as we traveled.

3387
02:47:19.721 --> 02:47:22.025
You also taught me a lot.

3388
02:47:22.025 --> 02:47:25.315
I'm sorry you and Miss Beau had to fight because of me.

3389
02:47:25.315 --> 02:47:28.126
I hope things are okay now, question mark?

3390
02:47:28.126 --> 02:47:30.084
It's so strange.
MARISHA: Oh, that's been sitting in the

3391
02:47:30.084 --> 02:47:31.650
mail for a while.

3392
02:47:31.650 --> 02:47:33.967
LIAM: It's so strange to me, I was obviously grateful

3393
02:47:33.967 --> 02:47:35.834
that she trusted me and stuck up for me,

3394
02:47:35.834 --> 02:47:37.825
but I also know why you had to be sure

3395
02:47:37.825 --> 02:47:40.102
and why you didn't trust me.

3396
02:47:40.102 --> 02:47:41.730
In a way it felt good to have to

3397
02:47:41.730 --> 02:47:43.324
prove my intentions to you.

3398
02:47:43.324 --> 02:47:46.392
It made me realize how important this task is to me,

3399
02:47:46.392 --> 02:47:50.247
even though it is hard, even though it is dangerous.

3400
02:47:50.247 --> 02:47:54.371
Telling you what I intended to do reaffirmed it in myself.

3401
02:47:54.371 --> 02:47:57.867
I have been hurt and betrayed by a lot of people, Mr. Caleb.

3402
02:47:57.867 --> 02:48:00.155
I'm not very good with reading people.

3403
02:48:00.155 --> 02:48:01.928
I'm not used to being lied to.

3404
02:48:01.928 --> 02:48:04.253
I think I've learned a little from you

3405
02:48:04.253 --> 02:48:06.845
and will be careful in the future.

3406
02:48:06.845 --> 02:48:09.089
The last thing I want to say, on our journey

3407
02:48:09.089 --> 02:48:11.889
you kept saying how you and the Mighty Nein

3408
02:48:11.889 --> 02:48:16.017
were assholes, or not good people.

3409
02:48:16.017 --> 02:48:18.888
I don't know much, Mr. Caleb, but I know

3410
02:48:18.888 --> 02:48:21.436
that is not true at all.

3411
02:48:21.436 --> 02:48:25.235
My blood, the way I look, make people hate me.

3412
02:48:25.235 --> 02:48:28.430
They fear me, they tried to kill me,

3413
02:48:28.430 --> 02:48:30.868
call me a monster, a freak.

3414
02:48:30.868 --> 02:48:33.564
Even the people I try and help sometimes

3415
02:48:33.564 --> 02:48:35.767
turn on me when they see me for what I am.

3416
02:48:35.767 --> 02:48:38.451
But when I met you and Jester and the Nein,

3417
02:48:38.451 --> 02:48:40.078
you didn't do that.

3418
02:48:40.078 --> 02:48:41.538
You helped me.

3419
02:48:41.538 --> 02:48:43.158
You made me laugh.

3420
02:48:43.158 --> 02:48:45.167
You apologized and assured me.

3421
02:48:45.167 --> 02:48:48.109
You were kind to me.

3422
02:48:48.109 --> 02:48:51.932
You are not assholes, Mr. Caleb.

3423
02:48:51.932 --> 02:48:53.660
You're strange and a bit weird.

3424
02:48:53.660 --> 02:48:56.668
You protect the people you care about.

3425
02:48:56.668 --> 02:49:00.945
I'd give 1000 treasures to have people like that in my life.

3426
02:49:00.945 --> 02:49:03.764
My friend, Magda, tells me that every time I say

3427
02:49:03.764 --> 02:49:06.330
something bad about myself, I am putting

3428
02:49:06.330 --> 02:49:09.249
iron weights in my pockets.

3429
02:49:09.249 --> 02:49:10.929
Sooner or later you'll drag yourself down

3430
02:49:10.929 --> 02:49:13.225
and not be able to get up.

3431
02:49:13.225 --> 02:49:16.057
Be kind to yourself, Mr. Caleb.

3432
02:49:16.057 --> 02:49:19.583
I don't want your pockets to get too heavy.

3433
02:49:19.583 --> 02:49:21.077
Thank you.

3434
02:49:21.077 --> 02:49:22.318
Calianna.

3435
02:49:24.784 --> 02:49:25.996
TALIESIN: That's a nice letter.

3436
02:49:25.996 --> 02:49:29.152
LAURA: She said, Beau, that the ribbon,

3437
02:49:29.152 --> 02:49:33.329
she said you could put it on your stick, too.

3438
02:49:33.329 --> 02:49:35.780
You don't need to wear it.

3439
02:49:35.780 --> 02:49:38.387
MARISHA: I do need a new stick bow.

3440
02:49:38.387 --> 02:49:40.330
LAURA: And Fjord.
TALIESIN: A Beau bo bow.

3441
02:49:40.330 --> 02:49:42.805
LAURA: This isn't potpourri, do you know what this is?

3442
02:49:42.805 --> 02:49:44.028
TALIESIN: Bow.

3443
02:49:44.028 --> 02:49:45.473
TRAVIS: Skin shavings?

3444
02:49:45.473 --> 02:49:49.279
LAURA: No, she talked to somebody, and it's

3445
02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:52.533
supposed to help with fur allergies.

3446
02:49:52.533 --> 02:49:53.491
TRAVIS: With what?

3447
02:49:53.491 --> 02:49:55.971
LAURA: Your allergies, you're allergic to cats.

3448
02:49:55.971 --> 02:50:00.971
She said if you sniff this, then it helps with allergies.

3449
02:50:01.428 --> 02:50:02.616
TRAVIS: I don't trust it.

3450
02:50:02.616 --> 02:50:04.866
(laughter)

3451
02:50:08.375 --> 02:50:11.518
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to write just the longest letter

3452
02:50:11.518 --> 02:50:12.759
back to Calianna.

3453
02:50:12.759 --> 02:50:14.840
Since this one is four pages long,

3454
02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:17.748
I'm going to write her back six pages.

3455
02:50:17.748 --> 02:50:19.747
TALIESIN: (laughs like Count von Count)

3456
02:50:19.747 --> 02:50:21.102
MARISHA: Oh.

3457
02:50:21.102 --> 02:50:22.450
I've never had a pen pal before.

3458
02:50:22.450 --> 02:50:23.536
Do they escalate?

3459
02:50:23.536 --> 02:50:25.369
Is that part of the deal?

3460
02:50:25.369 --> 02:50:26.718
(laughter)

3461
02:50:26.718 --> 02:50:29.396
LAURA: It does if you're a pen pal with me.

3462
02:50:29.396 --> 02:50:33.569
Oh, and I'm going to draw her lots of cool pictures.

3463
02:50:33.569 --> 02:50:34.623
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: (belches)

3464
02:50:34.623 --> 02:50:37.677
TALIESIN: Jester is basically an escalation machine.

3465
02:50:37.677 --> 02:50:38.690
An escalator.

3466
02:50:38.690 --> 02:50:42.940
MARISHA: I tie the new floral blue bow

3467
02:50:42.940 --> 02:50:44.448
on my Beau bo.

3468
02:50:44.448 --> 02:50:45.814
MATT: All right.

3469
02:50:45.814 --> 02:50:47.473
The bow for the Beau bo?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

3470
02:50:47.473 --> 02:50:48.947
TALIESIN: It's now a blue bo bow.

3471
02:50:48.947 --> 02:50:51.967
There's a blue bow on the bo, on Beau's bo.

3472
02:50:51.967 --> 02:50:53.134
LIAM: I cast Fireball.

3473
02:50:53.134 --> 02:50:55.384
(laughter)

3474
02:50:56.329 --> 02:50:57.522
MATT: Light 'em up.

3475
02:50:57.522 --> 02:50:59.551
All righty.

3476
02:50:59.551 --> 02:51:01.161
LIAM: No, but actually, I'm going to take,

3477
02:51:01.161 --> 02:51:04.054
I fold up the letter and I take out the other book

3478
02:51:04.054 --> 02:51:06.663
and slide it into that book and put that back into its--

3479
02:51:06.663 --> 02:51:08.222
holster.

3480
02:51:08.222 --> 02:51:12.066
MARISHA: I take both the Yasha and the Molly gift,

3481
02:51:12.066 --> 02:51:17.056
and I tuck them away with my circus pamphlet

3482
02:51:17.056 --> 02:51:21.727
and Molly's belt, and the other trinkets that I've kept.

3483
02:51:21.727 --> 02:51:22.773
SAM: You're scrapbooking.

3484
02:51:22.773 --> 02:51:23.806
MARISHA: My scrapbook.

3485
02:51:23.806 --> 02:51:25.944
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: My scrapbook pouch.

3486
02:51:25.944 --> 02:51:27.087
MATT: All righty.

3487
02:51:28.804 --> 02:51:30.161
The evening draws to a close,

3488
02:51:30.161 --> 02:51:32.293
you guys have your quarters arranged by Marion

3489
02:51:32.293 --> 02:51:33.653
while you're out and about.

3490
02:51:33.653 --> 02:51:35.438
You have a comfortable night's sleep

3491
02:51:35.438 --> 02:51:38.207
here in the Lavish Chateau, one of the finest establishments

3492
02:51:38.207 --> 02:51:40.540
to sleep here in Nicodranas.

3493
02:51:42.985 --> 02:51:45.163
Unless you have any other business to handle?

3494
02:51:45.163 --> 02:51:48.917
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to cast a Fortune's Favor on my cat.

3495
02:51:48.917 --> 02:51:49.750
MATT: Okay.

3496
02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:53.998
LIAM: Tell him to find his way to the roof of the Chateau,

3497
02:51:53.998 --> 02:51:56.123
and to stay up all night, and to watch

3498
02:51:56.123 --> 02:51:58.989
around the streets around the Chateau.

3499
02:51:58.989 --> 02:52:00.572
MATT: Okay, all righty.

3500
02:52:02.279 --> 02:52:07.097
Go ahead and roll a perception check for Frumpkin.

3501
02:52:07.097 --> 02:52:08.597
LIAM: Fortune's Favor.

3502
02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:11.552
(scoffs) Balls.

3503
02:52:13.206 --> 02:52:14.355
14.

3504
02:52:14.355 --> 02:52:16.549
MATT: 14, okay, good to know.

3505
02:52:16.549 --> 02:52:17.832
All right.

3506
02:52:17.832 --> 02:52:21.428
You guys have an uneventful evening,

3507
02:52:21.428 --> 02:52:24.299
a night of comfortable rest.

3508
02:52:24.299 --> 02:52:25.966
You come to in the morning,

3509
02:52:25.966 --> 02:52:29.683
the morning sun burning away

3510
02:52:29.683 --> 02:52:32.732
the fog bank that has come in to the marine layer

3511
02:52:32.732 --> 02:52:35.613
that has grayed the skies here along the shore,

3512
02:52:35.613 --> 02:52:39.996
a familiar sight to both Jester and Fjord especially.

3513
02:52:39.996 --> 02:52:42.060
You can already hear the gulls getting loud

3514
02:52:42.060 --> 02:52:44.143
with their morning meals.

3515
02:52:45.341 --> 02:52:47.929
Food is provided downstairs in the Chateau,

3516
02:52:47.929 --> 02:52:50.012
and the morning is yours.

3517
02:52:50.916 --> 02:52:54.824
As you come down as well, Yeza and Luc, there's--

3518
02:52:54.824 --> 02:52:55.728
SAM: Cast Disguise Self.

3519
02:52:55.728 --> 02:52:56.824
MATT: Yep.

3520
02:52:56.824 --> 02:52:58.086
Yeza's trying to convince Luc

3521
02:52:58.086 --> 02:52:59.477
to eat all the food on the plate,

3522
02:52:59.477 --> 02:53:02.599
but Luc is like, focused only on eating the starches,

3523
02:53:02.599 --> 02:53:04.345
and they're having like a small little

3524
02:53:04.345 --> 02:53:07.682
tussle when you come down, after casting the spell.

3525
02:53:07.682 --> 02:53:09.323
"Oh, hi.

3526
02:53:10.509 --> 02:53:12.117
"You're going to make Mommy really angry,

3527
02:53:12.117 --> 02:53:14.256
"and you don't want the woman with the crossbow angry,

3528
02:53:14.256 --> 02:53:16.458
"you want to eat all of the food."

3529
02:53:16.458 --> 02:53:19.989
SAM: What won't he eat, what is he not eating?

3530
02:53:19.989 --> 02:53:24.146
MATT: You look. A steamed fish

3531
02:53:24.146 --> 02:53:27.134
that's been dried out a bit on one side

3532
02:53:27.134 --> 02:53:28.600
he's not touching, because it looks

3533
02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:29.918
partially like a fish still.

3534
02:53:29.918 --> 02:53:32.640
(laughter)

3535
02:53:32.640 --> 02:53:36.445
There looks to be like a dried seaweed type.

3536
02:53:37.462 --> 02:53:41.503
It's actually quite good, but it looks not delectable,

3537
02:53:41.503 --> 02:53:43.152
especially for a child,

3538
02:53:43.152 --> 02:53:44.564
and he's just pushing it as far as he can

3539
02:53:44.564 --> 02:53:46.121
to the edges of the plate.

3540
02:53:46.121 --> 02:53:47.329
SAM: Wow.

3541
02:53:47.329 --> 02:53:50.497
LAURA: Ew, you have the seaweed salad.

3542
02:53:51.343 --> 02:53:53.419
SAM: Did you eat this growing up, Jester?

3543
02:53:53.419 --> 02:53:55.567
LAURA: Ew, no, I always pushed it to the side,

3544
02:53:55.567 --> 02:53:57.267
it looks so nasty.

3545
02:53:57.267 --> 02:53:59.263
MATT: As Marion comes to join you and goes,

3546
02:53:59.263 --> 02:54:02.021
"No, it's true, she was a very difficult eater."

3547
02:54:02.021 --> 02:54:04.881
SAM: But we always have to try new things.

3548
02:54:04.881 --> 02:54:09.040
So take one bite, and then you can be all done.

3549
02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:11.268
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3550
02:54:11.268 --> 02:54:13.085
With the advantage, because you are his mom.

3551
02:54:13.085 --> 02:54:15.537
MARISHA: Against a five-year-old.

3552
02:54:15.537 --> 02:54:16.945
SAM: Not great. (laughs)

3553
02:54:16.945 --> 02:54:19.646
Persuasion is plus one, okay.

3554
02:54:19.646 --> 02:54:20.587
12?

3555
02:54:20.587 --> 02:54:22.658
MATT: 12, that's enough, that's enough.

3556
02:54:22.658 --> 02:54:27.658
Begrudgingly, takes a bite of the seaweed salad and is like,

3557
02:54:28.665 --> 02:54:30.196
"(groans)."

3558
02:54:30.196 --> 02:54:31.029
LAURA: Hey.

3559
02:54:33.487 --> 02:54:35.590
MATT: (groans) He's like, you can tell he

3560
02:54:35.590 --> 02:54:38.146
doesn't mind it so much, but has to act the part,

3561
02:54:38.146 --> 02:54:39.892
and then takes a bit of the fish,

3562
02:54:39.892 --> 02:54:41.508
and actually seems to not mind the fish too much,

3563
02:54:41.508 --> 02:54:44.040
and then sets the fork down with like, absolute aggression,

3564
02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:44.943
across the plate.

3565
02:54:44.943 --> 02:54:46.606
SAM: You did such a good job, here.

3566
02:54:46.606 --> 02:54:49.416
I give him a handful of geode crystals.

3567
02:54:49.416 --> 02:54:51.424
MATT: "Whoa, what?

3568
02:54:51.424 --> 02:54:52.558
"Where did you?"

3569
02:54:52.558 --> 02:54:55.177
SAM: Yeah, that's what you get when you eat your veggies.

3570
02:54:55.177 --> 02:54:56.380
MATT: Looks at Yeza.

3571
02:54:56.380 --> 02:54:57.906
(laughter)

3572
02:54:57.906 --> 02:55:00.768
SAM: Your dad will give you even more cool stuff.

3573
02:55:00.768 --> 02:55:04.574
MATT: Yeza's like, "(sighs), it's good to have you back."

3574
02:55:04.574 --> 02:55:07.173
(laughter)

3575
02:55:07.173 --> 02:55:09.918
SAM: I'll keep spoiling this child as long as I can.

3576
02:55:09.918 --> 02:55:11.929
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

3577
02:55:11.929 --> 02:55:13.284
MATT: So.

3578
02:55:13.284 --> 02:55:15.867
SAM: So what's the plan for today?

3579
02:55:16.782 --> 02:55:19.165
TALIESIN: It's time to head out.

3580
02:55:19.165 --> 02:55:21.932
SAM: (groans)

3581
02:55:21.932 --> 02:55:23.381
You mean right away?

3582
02:55:23.381 --> 02:55:24.287
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3583
02:55:24.287 --> 02:55:26.354
MARISHA: I don't feel comfortable leaving Dairon

3584
02:55:26.354 --> 02:55:28.198
alone at the house alone for long

3585
02:55:28.198 --> 02:55:31.654
without any proper introductions.

3586
02:55:31.654 --> 02:55:34.857
TALIESIN: Things arrive and we're not there.

3587
02:55:34.857 --> 02:55:38.637
MATT: Yeza looks at Marion and goes, "Is it okay

3588
02:55:38.637 --> 02:55:43.637
"if me and Luc stay here, for the time being?"

3589
02:55:44.071 --> 02:55:47.784
Marion, "Of course, of course, trust me.

3590
02:55:47.784 --> 02:55:52.783
"I have my pull around the establishment,

3591
02:55:53.953 --> 02:55:57.929
"and to be fair, they owe me quite a bit,

3592
02:55:57.929 --> 02:56:01.179
"so we can make sure it's taken care of."

3593
02:56:03.382 --> 02:56:06.078
SAM: Well then, I'll grab Yeza and ask him

3594
02:56:06.078 --> 02:56:08.427
to step aside with me, I suppose.

3595
02:56:08.427 --> 02:56:11.609
MATT: "Yeah, of course, of course."

3596
02:56:11.609 --> 02:56:15.546
SAM: So hun-buns, I have to make a decision here,

3597
02:56:15.546 --> 02:56:18.010
I don't know what to do.

3598
02:56:18.010 --> 02:56:21.666
I want to stay with you and Luc so badly,

3599
02:56:21.666 --> 02:56:26.066
but I can't keep doing this spell.

3600
02:56:29.139 --> 02:56:30.747
MATT: "I know.

3601
02:56:34.374 --> 02:56:35.815
"Look.

3602
02:56:39.687 --> 02:56:42.233
"I'm just a lowly chemist.

3603
02:56:42.233 --> 02:56:45.400
"I've done some good things, you know, local to Felderwin,

3604
02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:48.019
"and you've helped me tremendously many times,

3605
02:56:48.019 --> 02:56:51.273
"and been privy to a lot of these, you know,

3606
02:56:51.273 --> 02:56:54.598
"minor accomplishments, but the things

3607
02:56:54.598 --> 02:56:59.311
"that you guys are doing, I mean, look at you.

3608
02:56:59.311 --> 02:57:02.636
"You're a regular

3609
02:57:02.636 --> 02:57:05.211
"(whispers) badass.

3610
02:57:06.131 --> 02:57:10.114
"And, you know,

3611
02:57:10.114 --> 02:57:12.655
"of course I want you to stay.

3612
02:57:14.646 --> 02:57:16.587
"But I can see in your eyes that

3613
02:57:16.587 --> 02:57:20.883
"you still have unfinished business."

3614
02:57:20.883 --> 02:57:21.716
SAM: I do.

3615
02:57:25.643 --> 02:57:30.643
I want the next time I see you to be,

3616
02:57:30.934 --> 02:57:33.134
you know, forever.

3617
02:57:35.406 --> 02:57:39.482
I don't know, I can't just stay here

3618
02:57:39.482 --> 02:57:43.778
and have half of myself here and half of myself

3619
02:57:43.778 --> 02:57:46.854
somewhere else.

3620
02:57:46.854 --> 02:57:50.437
I don't know if I'm strong enough to leave.

3621
02:57:51.538 --> 02:57:55.121
Because being here feels so wonderful, but.

3622
02:57:57.524 --> 02:57:59.616
MATT: "Do you need me to tell to you leave?"

3623
02:57:59.616 --> 02:58:00.866
SAM: Kind of, yeah.

3624
02:58:00.866 --> 02:58:02.432
MATT: "Then go.

3625
02:58:04.077 --> 02:58:07.041
"They'll protect you, right?

3626
02:58:07.041 --> 02:58:08.311
"You'll protect them?"

3627
02:58:08.311 --> 02:58:09.566
SAM: That's more like it, yeah.

3628
02:58:09.566 --> 02:58:11.878
MATT: "That makes more sense.

3629
02:58:11.878 --> 02:58:16.744
"But go, go and

3630
02:58:16.744 --> 02:58:21.694
"fix these problems you guys talk about.

3631
02:58:21.694 --> 02:58:26.694
"I don't know, stop wars, or, you know,

3632
02:58:28.275 --> 02:58:31.483
"whatever this hand thing is you've been worrying about too,

3633
02:58:31.483 --> 02:58:34.022
"go take care of it, because I know you can,

3634
02:58:34.022 --> 02:58:37.185
"I trust and I believe in you.

3635
02:58:37.185 --> 02:58:40.002
"And then we'll be here.

3636
02:58:40.002 --> 02:58:42.618
"We're just waiting for when you can.

3637
02:58:42.618 --> 02:58:44.352
"Even if it's just to stop by for a bit.

3638
02:58:44.352 --> 02:58:47.396
"But, you know, wow, we none of us thought we had

3639
02:58:47.396 --> 02:58:51.931
"this kind of a destiny in us, huh?"

3640
02:58:51.931 --> 02:58:52.891
SAM: No, no.

3641
02:58:52.891 --> 02:58:56.331
MATT: "A couple of backwoods halflings. (laughter)"

3642
02:58:56.331 --> 02:58:58.357
SAM: You were a prisoner of war!

3643
02:58:58.357 --> 02:59:00.275
MATT: "Yeah, that's insane."

3644
02:59:00.275 --> 02:59:01.261
SAM: That's crazy!

3645
02:59:01.261 --> 02:59:02.264
MATT: "I don't want to go back to that."

3646
02:59:02.264 --> 02:59:03.649
SAM: No, definitely not.

3647
02:59:03.649 --> 02:59:06.335
We've both been prisoners now.

3648
02:59:06.335 --> 02:59:08.559
MATT: "That's true, outlaws."

3649
02:59:08.559 --> 02:59:09.780
SAM: We are so cool!

3650
02:59:09.780 --> 02:59:10.910
Coolest parents ever.

3651
02:59:10.910 --> 02:59:12.445
MATT: "Brenattos!

3652
02:59:12.445 --> 02:59:14.695
(laughter)

3653
02:59:15.685 --> 02:59:20.206
"But no, go, take care of the things you need to.

3654
02:59:20.206 --> 02:59:22.352
"Come back whenever you can.

3655
02:59:22.352 --> 02:59:24.582
"We'll be here, let us know if you need anything to change.

3656
02:59:24.582 --> 02:59:29.573
"I mean, you're the head of the family now, so."

3657
02:59:30.857 --> 02:59:33.549
SAM: Well, thank you.

3658
02:59:33.549 --> 02:59:36.467
You've been so supportive of me.

3659
02:59:36.467 --> 02:59:39.214
MATT: "I'm just paying it back."

3660
02:59:39.214 --> 02:59:41.464
SAM: I promise I'll come back.

3661
02:59:42.481 --> 02:59:47.416
Here, I'll give him 500 gold.

3662
02:59:47.416 --> 02:59:48.249
MATT: "Whoa!"

3663
02:59:49.361 --> 02:59:50.834
SAM: Take this.

3664
02:59:50.834 --> 02:59:52.787
Keep spoiling our Luc.
MATT: You hear Luc go,

3665
02:59:52.787 --> 02:59:53.906
"What was that sound?"

3666
02:59:53.906 --> 02:59:55.581
"Nothing!"
SAM: It's fine.

3667
02:59:55.581 --> 02:59:57.084
Grownup talk.

3668
02:59:57.084 --> 02:59:58.540
MATT: It's a lot of gold coins.

3669
02:59:58.540 --> 02:59:59.478
He's like, "Ah!"

3670
02:59:59.478 --> 03:00:00.311
SAM: It's some platinum.

3671
03:00:00.311 --> 03:00:01.268
MATT: Some platinum, okay, that makes it

3672
03:00:01.268 --> 03:00:02.268
a little more manageable.

3673
03:00:02.268 --> 03:00:04.438
(laughter)

3674
03:00:04.438 --> 03:00:08.021
SAM: Keep spoiling our son as much as you can.

3675
03:00:08.912 --> 03:00:11.233
We didn't have much growing up, you and me.

3676
03:00:11.233 --> 03:00:12.657
MATT: "I know."

3677
03:00:12.657 --> 03:00:15.253
SAM: So why shouldn't he have whatever he wants,

3678
03:00:15.253 --> 03:00:16.138
at least for now.

3679
03:00:16.138 --> 03:00:17.206
MATT: "I agree.

3680
03:00:17.206 --> 03:00:19.031
"I also have to make sure that, you know,

3681
03:00:19.031 --> 03:00:20.374
"he grows up to appreciate it, too."

3682
03:00:20.374 --> 03:00:22.741
SAM: Sure, sure, yeah, teach him all the right lessons.

3683
03:00:22.741 --> 03:00:23.574
MATT: "Right, right."

3684
03:00:23.574 --> 03:00:26.713
SAM: But if he wants something, it's okay.

3685
03:00:26.713 --> 03:00:28.630
MATT: "I'll let him earn it."

3686
03:00:30.232 --> 03:00:34.292
SAM: And take this, too.

3687
03:00:34.292 --> 03:00:37.825
I'm going to give him my mask.

3688
03:00:37.825 --> 03:00:41.018
I don't want to use this any more.

3689
03:00:41.018 --> 03:00:43.685
I want to, when I come back,

3690
03:00:45.163 --> 03:00:48.188
I hope to come back to visit, but I really hope

3691
03:00:48.188 --> 03:00:50.842
that the next time that I come back,

3692
03:00:50.842 --> 03:00:54.326
I won't need this anymore.

3693
03:00:56.109 --> 03:01:00.216
MATT: "Whatever makes you happy and comfortable."

3694
03:01:00.216 --> 03:01:01.049
SAM: Okay.

3695
03:01:01.049 --> 03:01:02.529
MATT: "That's what is important to me."

3696
03:01:02.529 --> 03:01:04.010
SAM: Keep it, though, because I might like,

3697
03:01:04.010 --> 03:01:05.894
start a collection of masks or something,

3698
03:01:05.894 --> 03:01:07.637
so just like, put it away.

3699
03:01:07.637 --> 03:01:11.728
MATT: "Yeah, not that we need collections to gather for now.

3700
03:01:11.728 --> 03:01:13.630
"We don't really have a place to keep anything."

3701
03:01:13.630 --> 03:01:15.695
SAM: I just might send you some stuff, so--

3702
03:01:15.695 --> 03:01:18.444
MATT: "Okay."
SAM: Just find a place.

3703
03:01:18.444 --> 03:01:19.277
MATT: "Sure."

3704
03:01:21.037 --> 03:01:23.052
(laughter)

3705
03:01:23.052 --> 03:01:24.052
SAM: All right.

3706
03:01:25.145 --> 03:01:28.625
Well, I'll go say goodbye to the boy.

3707
03:01:28.625 --> 03:01:29.576
MATT: "Okay."

3708
03:01:29.576 --> 03:01:33.378
SAM: I'll go over and give Luc a big kiss,

3709
03:01:33.378 --> 03:01:36.795
and say: Mommy's got to go on another trip.

3710
03:01:38.152 --> 03:01:38.985
MATT: "Aww."

3711
03:01:39.886 --> 03:01:42.561
SAM: Yeah, I know, it--

3712
03:01:42.561 --> 03:01:44.453
it sucks.

3713
03:01:44.453 --> 03:01:46.653
MATT: "Are you going to go shoot more people?"

3714
03:01:46.653 --> 03:01:47.791
SAM: Yes, I am.

3715
03:01:47.791 --> 03:01:49.695
MATT: "Oh, that's so cool!"

3716
03:01:49.695 --> 03:01:51.163
SAM: Only bad people, though.

3717
03:01:51.163 --> 03:01:52.663
MATT: "Yeah, of course."

3718
03:01:54.016 --> 03:01:59.016
SAM: I left some money for dad to get you some,

3719
03:01:59.842 --> 03:02:02.471
like a training crossbow, all right?

3720
03:02:02.471 --> 03:02:03.304
MATT: "Okay."

3721
03:02:03.304 --> 03:02:05.669
SAM: Tell him that if you're really good,

3722
03:02:05.669 --> 03:02:07.384
he should take you practicing once a week.

3723
03:02:07.384 --> 03:02:08.217
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

3724
03:02:09.981 --> 03:02:11.266
SAM: But you have to be good.

3725
03:02:11.266 --> 03:02:12.434
You have to eat those vegetables.

3726
03:02:12.434 --> 03:02:13.851
Eat that seaweed.

3727
03:02:15.936 --> 03:02:17.717
Or else no crossbow!

3728
03:02:17.717 --> 03:02:18.717
MATT: "Okay, Mom."

3729
03:02:20.107 --> 03:02:23.065
SAM: Be good, be kind, be safe.

3730
03:02:26.718 --> 03:02:28.918
MATT: "Make sure you remember all the things that you shoot

3731
03:02:28.918 --> 03:02:29.895
"and tell me when you come back."

3732
03:02:29.895 --> 03:02:31.511
SAM: Okay.
MATT: "Okay."

3733
03:02:32.828 --> 03:02:35.623
SAM: I'll hide my tears and go over to Caleb

3734
03:02:35.623 --> 03:02:38.441
and just say: I'm ready.

3735
03:02:38.441 --> 03:02:40.202
LIAM: In the interest of time, can we say that

3736
03:02:40.202 --> 03:02:41.725
on the walk back from the beach yesterday,

3737
03:02:41.725 --> 03:02:45.528
I would have been able to pick up 150 gold worth

3738
03:02:45.528 --> 03:02:46.922
of the chalks I would need to do--

3739
03:02:46.922 --> 03:02:47.877
MATT: Yeah, I'll allow that.

3740
03:02:47.877 --> 03:02:50.157
LIAM: Okay, thank you.

3741
03:02:50.157 --> 03:02:50.990
Luc.

3742
03:02:53.191 --> 03:02:54.163
We haven't spoken much.

3743
03:02:54.163 --> 03:02:56.337
I'm like your mother's assistant.

3744
03:02:57.296 --> 03:02:58.138
MATT: "Okay."

3745
03:02:58.138 --> 03:03:00.882
LIAM: I need to do some magic, but I need some help,

3746
03:03:00.882 --> 03:03:02.579
in fact I need your mother and your father.

3747
03:03:02.579 --> 03:03:04.746
Will you help me do magic?

3748
03:03:06.220 --> 03:03:07.666
MATT: "Anything."

3749
03:03:07.666 --> 03:03:09.366
LIAM: Jester, is there a better place?

3750
03:03:09.366 --> 03:03:11.174
Should we do it right here, or perhaps

3751
03:03:11.174 --> 03:03:13.091
somewhere more private?

3752
03:03:14.245 --> 03:03:16.550
MATT: Marion steps in and goes, "Actually,

3753
03:03:16.550 --> 03:03:18.777
"there is a room upstairs we can go do this in.

3754
03:03:18.777 --> 03:03:20.374
"Come, come, come."
LIAM: Okay.

3755
03:03:20.374 --> 03:03:21.609
MATT: Leads you up into this antechamber

3756
03:03:21.609 --> 03:03:24.597
based off of her main work quarters.

3757
03:03:24.597 --> 03:03:25.458
LIAM: Okay.

3758
03:03:25.458 --> 03:03:28.643
So Luc, would you, well first,

3759
03:03:28.643 --> 03:03:30.116
will you hold my cat for a second?

3760
03:03:30.116 --> 03:03:30.949
MATT: "Whoa!"

3761
03:03:30.949 --> 03:03:33.565
LIAM: Okay, stand right here.

3762
03:03:33.565 --> 03:03:34.796
(laughter)

3763
03:03:34.796 --> 03:03:38.914
and I take chalk and I draw a small circle around his feet.

3764
03:03:38.914 --> 03:03:41.388
Then I draw a much larger circle

3765
03:03:41.388 --> 03:03:44.734
so that that small one is inside it, but on the perimeter,

3766
03:03:44.734 --> 03:03:49.389
and it's 10 feet across, and then I draw another circle,

3767
03:03:49.389 --> 03:03:54.160
and I say to Yeza: Would you please come stand over here?

3768
03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:57.477
Then I draw a small circle of chalk,

3769
03:03:57.477 --> 03:04:00.810
a third of the way away around his feet.

3770
03:04:01.692 --> 03:04:06.557
Veth, will you come over here, and I draw a third circle.

3771
03:04:06.557 --> 03:04:08.445
MATT: Kind of sit in their places.

3772
03:04:08.445 --> 03:04:10.770
LIAM: Luc, the world is very big,

3773
03:04:10.770 --> 03:04:15.770
and it might feel like the three of you are very far apart.

3774
03:04:16.252 --> 03:04:18.723
But you can always be connected.

3775
03:04:18.723 --> 03:04:22.109
I draw a line from Veth to Luc,

3776
03:04:22.109 --> 03:04:25.478
and then from the circle that Luc is in to his father,

3777
03:04:25.478 --> 03:04:29.113
and from Yeza to Veth.

3778
03:04:29.113 --> 03:04:31.344
Then I start to fill in the patterns

3779
03:04:31.344 --> 03:04:32.729
in the middle of the circle.

3780
03:04:32.729 --> 03:04:36.529
As far away as your mother may seem,

3781
03:04:36.529 --> 03:04:40.612
in the blink of an eye, she can come back to you.

3782
03:04:42.524 --> 03:04:45.024
She's off doing big things, and she has

3783
03:04:45.024 --> 03:04:47.857
a lot of assistants, nine of them.

3784
03:04:49.794 --> 03:04:51.252
MATT: "Okay."

3785
03:04:52.570 --> 03:04:55.073
LIAM: You'll hear from her.

3786
03:04:55.073 --> 03:04:57.073
And she'll be back soon.

3787
03:04:58.616 --> 03:05:01.080
Everybody ready to go?

3788
03:05:01.080 --> 03:05:01.998
SAM: Mm-hmm.

3789
03:05:01.998 --> 03:05:02.948
MATT: As you're about to finish,

3790
03:05:02.948 --> 03:05:05.361
Yeza comes in and just gives you a kiss before you leave.

3791
03:05:05.361 --> 03:05:07.319
SAM: As he does, I'm going to sleight-of-hand and

3792
03:05:07.319 --> 03:05:09.629
slip one of the sex potions into his pocket.

3793
03:05:09.629 --> 03:05:11.615
(laughter)

3794
03:05:11.615 --> 03:05:14.232
MATT: Roll sleight of hand.

3795
03:05:14.232 --> 03:05:15.920
SAM: Oh yeah, like it's a million.

3796
03:05:15.920 --> 03:05:17.088
29 or something.

3797
03:05:17.088 --> 03:05:19.088
MATT: None the wiser.

3798
03:05:19.088 --> 03:05:22.042
LIAM: So enjoy your dog, the cat is mine.

3799
03:05:22.042 --> 03:05:23.332
And I pull Frumpkin back.

3800
03:05:23.332 --> 03:05:25.922
Take a couple of steps back from me, will you?

3801
03:05:25.922 --> 03:05:28.399
MATT: Yeza does the same.

3802
03:05:28.399 --> 03:05:30.101
LIAM: Goodbye, Yeza.

3803
03:05:30.101 --> 03:05:31.309
MATT: "Bye, Caleb."

3804
03:05:32.516 --> 03:05:34.215
LIAM: Okay, six seconds, here we go.

3805
03:05:34.215 --> 03:05:37.513
I draw the last arcane sigil, and it lights up.

3806
03:05:37.513 --> 03:05:39.296
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

3807
03:05:39.296 --> 03:05:41.341
LAURA: I give my mom a big hug!

3808
03:05:41.341 --> 03:05:43.321
MATT: Right as he's finishing up, Marion gives you

3809
03:05:43.321 --> 03:05:48.025
a big hug, Jester, and says, "Take care of yourself."

3810
03:05:48.025 --> 03:05:48.929
LAURA: Yeah.

3811
03:05:48.929 --> 03:05:51.712
We'll be back. We'll be back to see you really soon, okay?

3812
03:05:51.712 --> 03:05:52.545
MATT: "Okay.

3813
03:05:52.545 --> 03:05:54.613
"Shine bright, my sapphire."

3814
03:05:54.613 --> 03:05:55.752
LAURA: I love you, Mama.

3815
03:05:55.752 --> 03:05:57.307
MATT: "Love you, Jester."

3816
03:05:57.307 --> 03:05:59.176
MARISHA: Oh shit, I left the dress on the guest bed!

3817
03:05:59.176 --> 03:06:01.174
(laughter)

3818
03:06:01.174 --> 03:06:03.086
MATT: As you're all gathering, Fjord,

3819
03:06:03.086 --> 03:06:04.888
you're about to step in there and you feel this like

3820
03:06:04.888 --> 03:06:09.059
cold spike shoot through the back of your head for a moment,

3821
03:06:09.059 --> 03:06:12.619
and a voice just gently caresses

3822
03:06:12.619 --> 03:06:15.185
the inside of your ear that says,

3823
03:06:15.185 --> 03:06:17.910
"Return."

3824
03:06:18.988 --> 03:06:21.315
Right as you finish that step, the momentum,

3825
03:06:21.315 --> 03:06:23.208
your eyes wide, the brain numb

3826
03:06:23.208 --> 03:06:26.044
from the sudden moment where time seems to slow

3827
03:06:26.044 --> 03:06:29.751
as you experience this, you step down, entering the circle,

3828
03:06:29.751 --> 03:06:33.017
and (whooshes), all of you are heading towards?

3829
03:06:33.017 --> 03:06:35.656
LIAM: Oh, back to the Dynasty, yes.

3830
03:06:35.656 --> 03:06:40.172
MATT: You all reemerge on the opposite side

3831
03:06:40.172 --> 03:06:43.478
of this transportation circle, now standing

3832
03:06:43.478 --> 03:06:47.139
beneath the Lucid Bastion, the guards familiar

3833
03:06:47.139 --> 03:06:51.973
with your arrival, not far from where you have arrived here,

3834
03:06:51.973 --> 03:06:53.541
greet you and there's not a huge issue at all,

3835
03:06:53.541 --> 03:06:56.451
but you all gather yourselves.

3836
03:06:56.451 --> 03:06:58.784
You've arrived successfully.

3837
03:07:00.564 --> 03:07:03.856
SAM: When Jester's mom was hugging her,

3838
03:07:03.856 --> 03:07:06.517
did the teleportation circle go off

3839
03:07:06.517 --> 03:07:08.434
and like just her arm got teleported?

3840
03:07:08.434 --> 03:07:10.641
(laughter)

3841
03:07:10.641 --> 03:07:12.979
It's just like a severed arm?

3842
03:07:12.979 --> 03:07:15.859
MATT: She just got like Philadelphia Experimented?

3843
03:07:15.859 --> 03:07:17.968
(laughter)

3844
03:07:17.968 --> 03:07:18.801
No.

3845
03:07:18.801 --> 03:07:19.821
SAM: Oh, damn.
MATT: Sorry.

3846
03:07:19.821 --> 03:07:20.990
SAM: That would've been awesome.

3847
03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:22.918
(laughter)

3848
03:07:22.918 --> 03:07:24.835
LIAM: It's not a bear, Sam.

3849
03:07:26.382 --> 03:07:27.725
MATT: All right.

3850
03:07:27.725 --> 03:07:29.591
LIAM: Why don't we go check on our house guest,

3851
03:07:29.591 --> 03:07:30.566
for starters?

3852
03:07:30.566 --> 03:07:31.957
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

3853
03:07:31.957 --> 03:07:34.343
TALIESIN: Wait for our things and get ready to go.

3854
03:07:34.343 --> 03:07:36.814
MARISHA: Anyone different seem to be watching us

3855
03:07:36.814 --> 03:07:38.922
in the arrival chamber?

3856
03:07:38.922 --> 03:07:41.089
MATT: Make a perception check.

3857
03:07:43.733 --> 03:07:44.780
MARISHA: 19.

3858
03:07:44.780 --> 03:07:45.781
MATT: 19.

3859
03:07:45.781 --> 03:07:48.507
Looking about, it seems to be standard

3860
03:07:48.507 --> 03:07:51.074
armored Kryn soldiers, though these all do wear

3861
03:07:51.074 --> 03:07:53.816
the elevated capelets

3862
03:07:53.816 --> 03:07:58.816
of those who are assigned higher levels of responsibility.

3863
03:07:59.384 --> 03:08:01.455
Different design than the ones you saw in Bazzoxan.

3864
03:08:01.455 --> 03:08:03.281
Those are more field, this is more specifically

3865
03:08:03.281 --> 03:08:05.956
assigned to the Lucid Bastion.

3866
03:08:05.956 --> 03:08:09.410
But nothing out of the ordinary.

3867
03:08:09.410 --> 03:08:12.544
You guys are escorted off of the Bastion's premises,

3868
03:08:12.544 --> 03:08:17.220
back into the Firmaments, to where your home is,

3869
03:08:17.220 --> 03:08:19.203
and you return

3870
03:08:19.203 --> 03:08:23.679
without any sort of issue or complications.

3871
03:08:23.679 --> 03:08:28.651
The sky's still, at this point it would be midday.

3872
03:08:28.651 --> 03:08:31.006
You know, let's say late morning.

3873
03:08:31.006 --> 03:08:33.007
Actually, from a distance from Nicodranas,

3874
03:08:33.007 --> 03:08:35.222
I'd say it's probably early morning,

3875
03:08:35.222 --> 03:08:37.900
though the sky is still dark with no sun.

3876
03:08:37.900 --> 03:08:41.226
LIAM: On that walk, telepathically, I ask my cat

3877
03:08:41.226 --> 03:08:44.487
if he saw anything funky outside the Chateau last night.

3878
03:08:44.487 --> 03:08:45.774
MATT: (meows)

3879
03:08:45.774 --> 03:08:47.350
LIAM: Okay, I'm still paranoid, good.

3880
03:08:47.350 --> 03:08:49.376
MATT: Understood.

3881
03:08:49.376 --> 03:08:53.610
You return to the Xhorhouse, Dairon is waiting.

3882
03:08:54.818 --> 03:08:57.072
Now you put in an order for the materials you required,

3883
03:08:57.072 --> 03:08:59.636
and what did you put in the order for?

3884
03:08:59.636 --> 03:09:02.102
TALIESIN: Food and water for the trip.

3885
03:09:03.081 --> 03:09:05.303
Transportation with a cart, if available,

3886
03:09:05.303 --> 03:09:08.136
a way of transporting, and camping supplies

3887
03:09:08.136 --> 03:09:09.553
for cold weather.

3888
03:09:10.512 --> 03:09:12.886
MATT: Yeah, camping supplies is doable, food and water,

3889
03:09:12.886 --> 03:09:17.591
there is a two horses and a cart wagon waiting for you,

3890
03:09:17.591 --> 03:09:20.428
already taken off to the side of the building.

3891
03:09:20.428 --> 03:09:22.221
TALIESIN: Yeah, enough for the travel and like

3892
03:09:22.221 --> 03:09:24.171
a little bit of spending money also, if they have anything,

3893
03:09:24.171 --> 03:09:25.875
but I had a funny feeling they weren't going to give us

3894
03:09:25.875 --> 03:09:26.708
any spending money.

3895
03:09:26.708 --> 03:09:28.977
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3896
03:09:28.977 --> 03:09:30.512
Anybody else have anything they wanted?

3897
03:09:30.512 --> 03:09:33.106
Oh, that's right, there was one other thing.

3898
03:09:33.106 --> 03:09:34.598
Some crossbow bolts.

3899
03:09:34.598 --> 03:09:35.656
SAM: I have some.

3900
03:09:35.656 --> 03:09:36.489
TALIESIN: Okay.

3901
03:09:36.489 --> 03:09:37.406
SAM: I got some--
TALIESIN: Oh, you already--

3902
03:09:37.406 --> 03:09:38.982
SAM: Yep, I got plenty.

3903
03:09:38.982 --> 03:09:40.467
Thank you.

3904
03:09:40.467 --> 03:09:41.432
MATT: Okay.

3905
03:09:41.432 --> 03:09:42.636
TALIESIN: I think that was just basics.

3906
03:09:42.636 --> 03:09:43.924
Nothing too fancy.

3907
03:09:43.924 --> 03:09:45.331
He wouldn't have thought of anything fancy.

3908
03:09:45.331 --> 03:09:46.360
MATT: Okay.

3909
03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:48.457
TALIESIN: Just some augmentation to our current kit.

3910
03:09:48.457 --> 03:09:49.471
MATT: All right.

3911
03:09:49.471 --> 03:09:54.144
You guys handle your introduction of Dairon to Essek?

3912
03:09:54.144 --> 03:09:58.116
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess, if we can summon Essek to do this.

3913
03:09:58.116 --> 03:09:59.847
Or if he, I don't know.

3914
03:09:59.847 --> 03:10:00.743
SAM: Essek!

3915
03:10:00.743 --> 03:10:01.854
MARISHA: Essek!

3916
03:10:01.854 --> 03:10:04.231
If you're fucking watching.

3917
03:10:04.231 --> 03:10:06.822
MATT: I mean, aside from messaging directly with Jester,

3918
03:10:06.822 --> 03:10:09.040
the other other option would be to have to send a runner

3919
03:10:09.040 --> 03:10:13.094
to go ahead and deliver a message, but it's up to you guys.

3920
03:10:13.094 --> 03:10:14.277
LAURA: Walk over to your house,

3921
03:10:14.277 --> 03:10:15.535
you don't have to do it here.

3922
03:10:15.535 --> 03:10:17.295
SAM: Do we know where he lives?

3923
03:10:17.295 --> 03:10:18.512
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: We do?

3924
03:10:18.512 --> 03:10:20.489
MATT: No, you have not been to Essek's place.

3925
03:10:20.489 --> 03:10:23.273
TALIESIN: I figured Essek would come with the delivery

3926
03:10:23.273 --> 03:10:25.949
of the materials anyway, but that was--

3927
03:10:25.949 --> 03:10:27.804
MATT: If you ordered it while you were gone,

3928
03:10:27.804 --> 03:10:29.611
they've already been brought, and Essek isn't going to be,

3929
03:10:29.611 --> 03:10:32.739
you know, not going to escort your delivery supplies.

3930
03:10:32.739 --> 03:10:34.079
TALIESIN: We can just message Essek.

3931
03:10:34.079 --> 03:10:36.644
LIAM: What's his title again? It's dope shit, what is it?

3932
03:10:36.644 --> 03:10:41.194
MATT: I believe, need to look it up again.

3933
03:10:41.194 --> 03:10:43.012
TALIESIN: Or we can stop by on the way out.
LIAM: It's not UPS guy.

3934
03:10:43.012 --> 03:10:44.203
It's a really cool sounding name.

3935
03:10:44.203 --> 03:10:45.501
SAM and LIAM: Shadowhand.

3936
03:10:45.501 --> 03:10:46.999
MATT: Shadow Hand, that's what it is.

3937
03:10:46.999 --> 03:10:48.065
Yes.

3938
03:10:48.065 --> 03:10:49.977
SAM: Yeah, message him, Jess.

3939
03:10:49.977 --> 03:10:51.772
LAURA: Okay.

3940
03:10:51.772 --> 03:10:53.339
SAM: Let's get this how on the road.

3941
03:10:53.339 --> 03:10:55.822
LAURA: Should I just tell him that Dairon's here

3942
03:10:55.822 --> 03:10:57.279
and somebody's watching the house,

3943
03:10:57.279 --> 03:10:59.449
so don't you worry that there's a person here?

3944
03:10:59.449 --> 03:11:00.832
TALIESIN: We're taking off and leaving the house

3945
03:11:00.832 --> 03:11:02.344
in someone's care.

3946
03:11:02.344 --> 03:11:04.309
MARISHA: Well, you have to bring him here so we can do

3947
03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:05.969
a face-to-face meeting.

3948
03:11:05.969 --> 03:11:07.716
Just say like hey, come here, we want to introduce you

3949
03:11:07.716 --> 03:11:09.514
to our new--

3950
03:11:09.514 --> 03:11:13.960
MATT: To remind you, like, this journey you're taking,

3951
03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:15.800
how are you doing this journey?

3952
03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:17.627
The discussion when you were in the Lucid Bastion

3953
03:11:17.627 --> 03:11:21.218
was Essek was going to take you there via magic.

3954
03:11:21.218 --> 03:11:22.051
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

3955
03:11:22.051 --> 03:11:23.542
We should just tell him to come to the house.

3956
03:11:23.542 --> 03:11:25.459
SAM: Essek, come over!

3957
03:11:25.459 --> 03:11:27.579
LAURA: Okay, I'll send a message to Essek.

3958
03:11:27.579 --> 03:11:28.638
MATT: All right.

3959
03:11:28.638 --> 03:11:30.213
TALIESIN: That's right, thank you.
MATT: No worries.

3960
03:11:30.213 --> 03:11:31.583
LAURA: Hey Essek, come over please,

3961
03:11:31.583 --> 03:11:33.938
we're going to leave and we need your help and stuff.

3962
03:11:34.913 --> 03:11:36.308
MATT: Easily enough.

3963
03:11:36.308 --> 03:11:38.533
SAM: Put a bunch of caltrops down on the floor.

3964
03:11:38.533 --> 03:11:41.956
He'll just glide right in.
MARISHA: Ooh.

3965
03:11:41.956 --> 03:11:45.365
I throw down some ball bearings, see if any of them move.

3966
03:11:45.365 --> 03:11:46.400
MATT: Okay.
(laughter)

3967
03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:48.059
All right, fair enough.

3968
03:11:48.059 --> 03:11:49.226
All right, so.

3969
03:11:50.421 --> 03:11:53.434
A short time passes until eventually

3970
03:11:53.434 --> 03:11:54.824
there is a rap at the door.

3971
03:11:54.824 --> 03:11:56.126
(knocking)

3972
03:11:56.126 --> 03:11:58.055
MARISHA: Ooh, I get into position so I have

3973
03:11:58.055 --> 03:11:59.425
view of the ball bearings.

3974
03:11:59.425 --> 03:12:02.762
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Be really bad if he just banana peels.

3975
03:12:02.762 --> 03:12:06.081
MATT: It would amazing, and we'll find out here in a second.

3976
03:12:06.081 --> 03:12:08.531
Who gets the door?

3977
03:12:08.531 --> 03:12:10.681
SAM: I'll get it with my Mage Hand.

3978
03:12:10.681 --> 03:12:11.577
MATT: All right.

3979
03:12:11.577 --> 03:12:12.748
(creaking)

3980
03:12:12.748 --> 03:12:13.855
TALIESIN: Ting-ting ting-ting ting-ting.

3981
03:12:13.855 --> 03:12:16.183
MATT: The door opens, the chimes dingle.

3982
03:12:16.183 --> 03:12:17.526
TALIESIN: Never get old.

3983
03:12:17.526 --> 03:12:18.869
MATT: There are two armed guards that are just

3984
03:12:18.869 --> 03:12:20.356
escorting Essek, who are just waiting outside,

3985
03:12:20.356 --> 03:12:23.457
and Essek arrives and goes, "Hello.

3986
03:12:23.457 --> 03:12:25.675
"It seems you have made your preparations

3987
03:12:25.675 --> 03:12:27.014
"and are ready to leave?"

3988
03:12:27.014 --> 03:12:31.796
MARISHA: Yes, you may enter and cross into the threshold.

3989
03:12:31.796 --> 03:12:33.184
MATT: "Thank you."

3990
03:12:33.184 --> 03:12:34.654
He glides in.

3991
03:12:34.654 --> 03:12:36.945
You watch the ball bearings actually

3992
03:12:36.945 --> 03:12:39.257
separating out around his form.

3993
03:12:39.257 --> 03:12:40.522
ALL: Whoa!

3994
03:12:40.522 --> 03:12:42.047
MATT: Like there is some invisible force

3995
03:12:42.047 --> 03:12:45.046
that is pushing them outward,

3996
03:12:45.046 --> 03:12:48.816
and just generating this strange force

3997
03:12:48.816 --> 03:12:49.743
that keeps them at bay.

3998
03:12:49.743 --> 03:12:51.197
LIAM: Fucking dunamancy.

3999
03:12:51.197 --> 03:12:52.396
TALIESIN: Like a hovercraft.

4000
03:12:52.396 --> 03:12:54.074
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

4001
03:12:54.074 --> 03:12:57.764
SAM: Oh no, did we leave the ball bearings on the floor?

4002
03:12:57.764 --> 03:12:59.770
MARISHA: Silly me.

4003
03:12:59.770 --> 03:13:00.832
(laughter)

4004
03:13:00.832 --> 03:13:02.530
SAM: You know who we should talk to about that?

4005
03:13:02.530 --> 03:13:04.882
Our housekeeper, Dairon.

4006
03:13:04.882 --> 03:13:07.748
MATT: "You're a very curious bunch, indeed."

4007
03:13:07.748 --> 03:13:10.125
(chuckling)

4008
03:13:10.125 --> 03:13:10.958
MARISHA: Dairon?!

4009
03:13:11.810 --> 03:13:13.788
MATT: Dairon is already like right there behind you,

4010
03:13:13.788 --> 03:13:15.303
arms crossed.

4011
03:13:15.303 --> 03:13:17.944
"Yes, I have arrived."

4012
03:13:17.944 --> 03:13:20.679
MARISHA: Be more conscious to pick up all the ball bearings

4013
03:13:20.679 --> 03:13:22.839
next time, please.

4014
03:13:22.839 --> 03:13:25.441
MATT: "My apologies, Beauregard.

4015
03:13:25.441 --> 03:13:28.730
"I will not let this happen again."

4016
03:13:28.730 --> 03:13:29.982
MARISHA: Thank you.

4017
03:13:29.982 --> 03:13:34.208
I would like to introduce you to our liaison.

4018
03:13:34.208 --> 03:13:38.517
Essek, of the Shadowhand?

4019
03:13:38.517 --> 03:13:39.523
Right, is that right?

4020
03:13:39.523 --> 03:13:40.979
SAM: He's the Shadowhand.

4021
03:13:40.979 --> 03:13:43.027
MARISHA: Den Thelyss?

4022
03:13:43.027 --> 03:13:44.707
MATT: "I have heard of you.

4023
03:13:44.707 --> 03:13:45.937
"It is a pleasure."

4024
03:13:45.937 --> 03:13:49.360
He goes, "Ah, well, it is a pleasure to make

4025
03:13:49.360 --> 03:13:52.348
"your acquaintance as well, Dairon."

4026
03:13:52.348 --> 03:13:54.579
TALIESIN: Anything needs handling while we're gone,

4027
03:13:54.579 --> 03:13:57.194
this is a good point of contact for the house,

4028
03:13:57.194 --> 03:13:58.086
or otherwise.

4029
03:13:58.086 --> 03:13:59.990
MARISHA: Since we had to drop Yeza off,

4030
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:04.452
we figured it was smart to get a keeper.

4031
03:14:04.452 --> 03:14:05.677
MATT: "Understood.

4032
03:14:05.677 --> 03:14:07.379
"Well, have you gathered your things,

4033
03:14:07.379 --> 03:14:08.317
"are you ready for your journey, then?"

4034
03:14:08.317 --> 03:14:09.159
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4035
03:14:09.159 --> 03:14:10.883
LIAM: I think so.

4036
03:14:10.883 --> 03:14:13.704
MATT: "Then come, join me outside."

4037
03:14:13.704 --> 03:14:17.046
Turns around and glides out, and the ball bearings

4038
03:14:17.046 --> 03:14:19.527
get pushed off again to the sides of the wall.

4039
03:14:19.527 --> 03:14:22.190
Clatter, looks down as he passes by at them.

4040
03:14:22.190 --> 03:14:23.804
(chuckles)

4041
03:14:23.804 --> 03:14:24.888
SAM: You could call him the Hover Hand.

4042
03:14:24.888 --> 03:14:26.121
LIAM: But he didn't see the fucking water

4043
03:14:26.121 --> 03:14:27.469
we put over the door.

4044
03:14:27.469 --> 03:14:28.725
MATT: Oh, shit!

4045
03:14:28.725 --> 03:14:30.884
(laughter)

4046
03:14:30.884 --> 03:14:33.240
Welcome to Mighty Pranks.

4047
03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:34.603
All right, so.

4048
03:14:34.603 --> 03:14:36.181
SAM: Are you hover-handing?
MARISHA: Yes.

4049
03:14:36.181 --> 03:14:37.264
SAM: She's hover-handing me.

4050
03:14:37.264 --> 03:14:38.539
MATT: Hover-handing?

4051
03:14:38.539 --> 03:14:40.789
(laughter)

4052
03:14:42.482 --> 03:14:44.793
LIAM: Essek Thelyss in every photo.

4053
03:14:44.793 --> 03:14:47.131
(laughter)

4054
03:14:47.131 --> 03:14:48.280
TALIESIN: Sorry.

4055
03:14:48.280 --> 03:14:52.036
MATT: All right, so let me get this spell at the ready here.

4056
03:14:52.036 --> 03:14:56.119
As you all gather, the Shadowhand takes a count.

4057
03:14:58.258 --> 03:14:59.175
"Six, seven.

4058
03:15:00.442 --> 03:15:02.094
"Is it just the seven of us?"

4059
03:15:02.094 --> 03:15:03.974
TALIESIN: And a horse and cart, if possible.

4060
03:15:03.974 --> 03:15:05.310
MATT: "(chuckles)

4061
03:15:05.310 --> 03:15:07.674
"Unfortunately, this particular magic

4062
03:15:07.674 --> 03:15:11.004
"does not allow for such a cart to come."

4063
03:15:11.004 --> 03:15:15.720
Let me double-check here to see if the horse can.

4064
03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:17.470
TALIESIN: Well, without the cart.

4065
03:15:18.945 --> 03:15:20.617
SAM: Why'd you get all this stuff?

4066
03:15:20.617 --> 03:15:22.593
TALIESIN: I mean, we can carry a lot of it with us at least,

4067
03:15:22.593 --> 03:15:24.582
but it seemed--

4068
03:15:24.582 --> 03:15:29.582
MATT: "I can bring you or the cart."

4069
03:15:29.938 --> 03:15:31.618
SAM: Let's go with us.

4070
03:15:31.618 --> 03:15:33.841
TALIESIN: I mean, we should vote on it, I suppose, but.

4071
03:15:33.841 --> 03:15:34.965
(laughter)

4072
03:15:34.965 --> 03:15:38.387
We'll pack as much of the food and supplies as we can.

4073
03:15:38.387 --> 03:15:39.367
MATT: "Very well."
TALIESIN: It's fine,

4074
03:15:39.367 --> 03:15:42.376
we can use the horse later.

4075
03:15:42.376 --> 03:15:45.388
MATT: From underneath the robe, the hand produces the map,

4076
03:15:45.388 --> 03:15:46.377
that was requested.

4077
03:15:46.377 --> 03:15:47.210
TALIESIN: Excellent.

4078
03:15:47.210 --> 03:15:49.137
MATT: Which will be arriving in the mail this next week.

4079
03:15:49.137 --> 03:15:50.594
(laughter)

4080
03:15:50.594 --> 03:15:52.377
Thank you, Deven, for rushing that.

4081
03:15:52.377 --> 03:15:53.210
TALIESIN: Sorry.

4082
03:15:54.380 --> 03:15:56.575
MATT: This'll give you at least a brief overview

4083
03:15:56.575 --> 03:15:59.316
of what the map contains for now.

4084
03:15:59.316 --> 03:16:01.685
LIAM: That's Orange County.

4085
03:16:01.685 --> 03:16:05.602
MATT: "The last request I have is a destination."

4086
03:16:07.614 --> 03:16:08.675
LIAM: Caduceus.

4087
03:16:08.675 --> 03:16:10.905
SAM: Yeah, you know where we're going.

4088
03:16:10.905 --> 03:16:12.215
The Alps, right?

4089
03:16:12.215 --> 03:16:14.023
TALIESIN: The Flotket Alps,

4090
03:16:14.023 --> 03:16:15.498
and I believe it's on the other side

4091
03:16:15.498 --> 03:16:17.808
of the Ivory Lake, if I'm not--

4092
03:16:17.808 --> 03:16:21.217
MARISHA: Hang on, I wrote down the--

4093
03:16:22.219 --> 03:16:23.558
TALIESIN: Sure.

4094
03:16:23.558 --> 03:16:24.942
SAM: Kravaraad?

4095
03:16:24.942 --> 03:16:27.504
TALIESIN: Shadycreek Run, yeah, so it would be--

4096
03:16:27.504 --> 03:16:30.945
MARISHA: Sand,

4097
03:16:30.945 --> 03:16:33.270
Crystalsands Tundra.

4098
03:16:33.270 --> 03:16:34.995
Yeah, the Kravaraad volcano.

4099
03:16:34.995 --> 03:16:36.036
TALIESIN: The Kravaraad Volcano.

4100
03:16:36.036 --> 03:16:38.854
MARISHA: In the Flotket Alps.

4101
03:16:38.854 --> 03:16:40.917
TALIESIN: If we can't get immediately there,

4102
03:16:40.917 --> 03:16:44.638
then I say Cinderrest Sanctum is the closest thing

4103
03:16:44.638 --> 03:16:45.796
I can see on the map.

4104
03:16:45.796 --> 03:16:47.869
MATT: "Well, I need a singular destination.

4105
03:16:47.869 --> 03:16:52.869
"This magic is a bit volatile, if--"

4106
03:16:53.340 --> 03:16:54.882
MARISHA: Kravaraad, yeah.

4107
03:16:54.882 --> 03:16:56.848
MATT: "Kravaraad, you say.

4108
03:16:56.848 --> 03:16:57.992
"Very well.

4109
03:16:57.992 --> 03:16:59.462
"Let us hope for the best, friends."

4110
03:16:59.462 --> 03:17:01.378
You watch the hand that's still out there

4111
03:17:01.378 --> 03:17:03.941
after holding the map just like, begin drawing

4112
03:17:03.941 --> 03:17:07.163
this slow sigil, you watch the hand

4113
03:17:07.163 --> 03:17:09.502
leaving trails behind it as it moves,

4114
03:17:09.502 --> 03:17:11.337
and as it does, each of you feel the ground

4115
03:17:11.337 --> 03:17:13.996
beneath your feet begin to (whooshing),

4116
03:17:13.996 --> 03:17:17.105
more warm, and warmer still.

4117
03:17:17.105 --> 03:17:20.338
You're all suddenly under-lit by this ever-swelling light

4118
03:17:20.338 --> 03:17:22.470
from beneath you.

4119
03:17:22.470 --> 03:17:25.181
Somebody please roll a d100 for me.

4120
03:17:25.181 --> 03:17:26.372
LIAM: I gotcha.
SAM: Whoa, whoa.

4121
03:17:26.372 --> 03:17:27.701
LAURA: 100?!

4122
03:17:27.701 --> 03:17:28.897
SAM: We've never done this before.

4123
03:17:28.897 --> 03:17:30.398
LIAM: Well, I can do a 10 and a 10.

4124
03:17:30.398 --> 03:17:32.894
MATT: I think Caleb's got it.

4125
03:17:32.894 --> 03:17:33.955
LIAM: 32.

4126
03:17:33.955 --> 03:17:34.883
MATT: 32.

4127
03:17:34.883 --> 03:17:38.208
SAM: Ooh, that seems just under or just over something.

4128
03:17:38.208 --> 03:17:39.980
MATT: Okay.

4129
03:17:39.980 --> 03:17:41.863
LIAM: 31, 33.

4130
03:17:41.863 --> 03:17:43.270
(laughter)

4131
03:17:43.270 --> 03:17:46.753
SAM: Well, if it's 33% chance, we're fucked.

4132
03:17:46.753 --> 03:17:48.862
(laughter)

4133
03:17:48.862 --> 03:17:49.779
MATT: Okay, so.

4134
03:17:51.223 --> 03:17:53.680
TALIESIN: We're all dead.

4135
03:17:53.680 --> 03:17:56.190
We're all inside a volcano.

4136
03:17:56.190 --> 03:17:57.946
SAM: Oh no.
TALIESIN: He's laughing way too much.

4137
03:17:57.946 --> 03:18:00.166
LAURA: Oh no, what did he do?
TALIESIN: He's laughing a lot.

4138
03:18:00.166 --> 03:18:02.228
LAURA: Did Essek just kill the party?

4139
03:18:02.228 --> 03:18:04.976
MATT: No, no no, it does not kill the party.

4140
03:18:04.976 --> 03:18:06.411
You said it was 30--?

4141
03:18:06.411 --> 03:18:07.244
LIAM: 32.

4142
03:18:07.244 --> 03:18:09.468
MATT: 32. Okay.

4143
03:18:09.468 --> 03:18:11.449
I need you to go ahead, okay no.

4144
03:18:11.449 --> 03:18:13.340
But you all do suddenly take--

4145
03:18:13.340 --> 03:18:14.450
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

4146
03:18:14.450 --> 03:18:15.283
TALIESIN: Cool.

4147
03:18:15.283 --> 03:18:18.002
LIAM: We just teleported into stone.

4148
03:18:18.002 --> 03:18:20.143
MARISHA: Oh no.

4149
03:18:25.236 --> 03:18:26.924
MATT: 20 points of force damage.

4150
03:18:26.924 --> 03:18:28.707
TALIESIN: Okay.

4151
03:18:28.707 --> 03:18:31.515
MATT: You all feel your body suddenly shift

4152
03:18:31.515 --> 03:18:35.081
in but an instant into an open vacuum of space,

4153
03:18:35.081 --> 03:18:38.866
and then suddenly you exist simultaneously

4154
03:18:38.866 --> 03:18:41.772
with dense matter, and the magic rips you

4155
03:18:41.772 --> 03:18:43.531
back out of the space, and in doing so,

4156
03:18:43.531 --> 03:18:46.469
you feel horrible pain wrack you from head to toe,

4157
03:18:46.469 --> 03:18:49.244
as if you're suddenly just pushed into a wall

4158
03:18:49.244 --> 03:18:52.290
with the might of 100 hands and then pulled back.

4159
03:18:52.290 --> 03:18:54.676
Roll another d100 for me, please.

4160
03:18:54.676 --> 03:18:55.694
LIAM: You got it, you got it.

4161
03:18:55.694 --> 03:18:57.313
MATT: That was a mishap.

4162
03:18:57.313 --> 03:18:58.807
MARISHA: That was a mishap?

4163
03:18:58.807 --> 03:18:59.640
MATT: Yes.

4164
03:18:59.640 --> 03:19:01.134
MARISHA: As in it didn't work?

4165
03:19:01.134 --> 03:19:01.967
LIAM: 92.

4166
03:19:03.514 --> 03:19:05.081
MATT: 92, nice.

4167
03:19:06.243 --> 03:19:07.737
All right.

4168
03:19:07.737 --> 03:19:08.695
So.
TALIESIN: Now we're all dead.

4169
03:19:08.695 --> 03:19:11.028
LIAM: You gain two levels.

4170
03:19:11.028 --> 03:19:14.517
MATT: After that weird little flux of energy,

4171
03:19:14.517 --> 03:19:19.067
suddenly your vision goes white,

4172
03:19:20.096 --> 03:19:23.698
and imagery begins to come back into view.

4173
03:19:23.698 --> 03:19:27.463
You begin to see shapes, crests, heavy peaks,

4174
03:19:27.463 --> 03:19:32.463
mountains all around you, surrounded by tall mountains.

4175
03:19:32.895 --> 03:19:37.255
Jagged peaks and spires that come to dangerous points,

4176
03:19:37.255 --> 03:19:41.078
all coated in snow and ice.

4177
03:19:41.078 --> 03:19:44.549
You're sitting in the center of some sort of a valley

4178
03:19:44.549 --> 03:19:46.417
amongst a mountain range.

4179
03:19:46.417 --> 03:19:47.743
The temperature immediately hits you.

4180
03:19:47.743 --> 03:19:51.093
You thought it was cold in Xhorhas, it's much colder here.

4181
03:19:51.093 --> 03:19:54.550
As you exhale your first breath, you can see the cloud,

4182
03:19:54.550 --> 03:19:57.541
the moisture from your breath

4183
03:19:57.541 --> 03:19:59.637
begins to freeze in the air.

4184
03:19:59.637 --> 03:20:04.447
It's not arctic, but it's pretty cold.

4185
03:20:04.447 --> 03:20:07.879
There is snowfall.

4186
03:20:07.879 --> 03:20:11.087
Heavy, not blizzard, but relatively heavy,

4187
03:20:11.087 --> 03:20:13.134
that is falling all around you,

4188
03:20:13.134 --> 03:20:15.967
and the clouds are obscuring some of the more distant

4189
03:20:15.967 --> 03:20:17.558
peaks of your view.

4190
03:20:17.558 --> 03:20:20.428
It looks like a storm is working its way in,

4191
03:20:20.428 --> 03:20:23.177
and hasn't quite hit its full breadth yet.

4192
03:20:23.177 --> 03:20:24.262
What was that?

4193
03:20:24.262 --> 03:20:25.187
LAURA: Nothing.

4194
03:20:25.187 --> 03:20:27.428
(laughter)

4195
03:20:29.468 --> 03:20:32.473
MATT: Around you in the valley, you can see,

4196
03:20:32.473 --> 03:20:34.208
as you stand on the edge of one of these

4197
03:20:34.208 --> 03:20:38.028
mountain bases, an entire pine tree forest

4198
03:20:38.028 --> 03:20:41.870
dense with snow and white powder

4199
03:20:41.870 --> 03:20:44.354
that has coated it from end to end.

4200
03:20:44.354 --> 03:20:47.348
Just elements of the greenery below visible.

4201
03:20:47.348 --> 03:20:50.524
Across this valley, immediately before you,

4202
03:20:50.524 --> 03:20:54.745
this singular mountain that resists any of this snowfall.

4203
03:20:54.745 --> 03:20:59.119
You see, instead of the gray and white and ice,

4204
03:20:59.119 --> 03:21:03.777
there is black, cragulous, climbing rock.

4205
03:21:03.777 --> 03:21:08.211
From it, you can see three different drifting plumes

4206
03:21:08.211 --> 03:21:13.211
of black smoke from different positions along its side.

4207
03:21:13.459 --> 03:21:17.086
You can just barely see little glowing streams of orange

4208
03:21:17.086 --> 03:21:21.620
pouring from different vents along its side.

4209
03:21:21.620 --> 03:21:25.247
The very base of the center of where these trees are,

4210
03:21:25.247 --> 03:21:27.248
you can see steam rising from

4211
03:21:27.248 --> 03:21:29.121
a small basin or a lake that's gathered

4212
03:21:29.121 --> 03:21:33.596
from what little bit of rainfall or water

4213
03:21:33.596 --> 03:21:36.118
that collects down here into the lake meets

4214
03:21:36.118 --> 03:21:38.945
where this molten rock drifts.

4215
03:21:38.945 --> 03:21:41.278
(whooshing)

4216
03:21:43.182 --> 03:21:45.936
As you collect yourselves and look upon this

4217
03:21:45.936 --> 03:21:48.744
isolated volcano amongst what you assume to be

4218
03:21:48.744 --> 03:21:52.727
the Flotket Alps, the storm mounting,

4219
03:21:53.746 --> 03:21:57.397
you've arrived in the Greying Wildlands.

4220
03:21:57.397 --> 03:22:00.302
And we'll pick up from there next week.

4221
03:22:00.302 --> 03:22:03.267
MARISHA: Dang.
TALIESIN: Yeah!

4222
03:22:03.267 --> 03:22:05.594
Fucking ready for this shit.

4223
03:22:05.594 --> 03:22:06.427
MATT: Oh, man.

4224
03:22:06.427 --> 03:22:08.564
TRAVIS: Is it a lava lake? A lake of lava?

4225
03:22:08.564 --> 03:22:11.926
MATT: It's a lake of water, but the streams of molten rock

4226
03:22:11.926 --> 03:22:15.496
are meeting the lake and causing steam to rise up

4227
03:22:15.496 --> 03:22:17.537
as it cools into rock.

4228
03:22:17.537 --> 03:22:18.613
LAURA: Awesome.

4229
03:22:18.613 --> 03:22:20.975
TALIESIN: All that snow got to go somewhere.

4230
03:22:20.975 --> 03:22:22.069
MATT: Good to know where we are now.

4231
03:22:22.069 --> 03:22:24.471
I had to prepare many locations based on

4232
03:22:24.471 --> 03:22:26.552
what that teleportation roll was going to be.

4233
03:22:26.552 --> 03:22:28.150
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.
SAM: Really?

4234
03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:29.959
MATT: Because it can end up throwing you to a similar area,

4235
03:22:29.959 --> 03:22:30.853
which means you guys could've ended up

4236
03:22:30.853 --> 03:22:32.813
in a volcano in another place in the world entirely.

4237
03:22:32.813 --> 03:22:34.146
TALIESIN: Oh man.

4238
03:22:34.146 --> 03:22:37.058
MATT: It could've been just a slight off-kilter

4239
03:22:37.058 --> 03:22:39.105
and thrown you guys into like, the Savalirwood,

4240
03:22:39.105 --> 03:22:40.383
it could turn you all over--

4241
03:22:40.383 --> 03:22:41.875
SAM: Why would you do that to yourself, Matt?

4242
03:22:41.875 --> 03:22:43.167
TALIESIN: Because it's funny, that's why.

4243
03:22:43.167 --> 03:22:44.710
MATT: Because it's what you guys found,

4244
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:46.700
and it's fun to see where it happens.

4245
03:22:46.700 --> 03:22:47.807
Who knows.
SAM: You're amazing.

4246
03:22:47.807 --> 03:22:49.590
LAURA: That's so cool.

4247
03:22:49.590 --> 03:22:50.915
MATT: We'll pick up there next week.

4248
03:22:50.915 --> 03:22:52.899
Exactly, that's half the fun of this game, man, the chaos.

4249
03:22:52.899 --> 03:22:55.013
MARISHA: How weird would it have been if we would've landed

4250
03:22:55.013 --> 03:22:58.071
on a volcano where Traveler Con was being scouted?

4251
03:22:58.071 --> 03:22:59.221
LIAM: Yeah, I wish we'd gone there.

4252
03:22:59.221 --> 03:23:00.866
MATT: Oh, no, it would've been that one.

4253
03:23:00.866 --> 03:23:02.397
LAURA: That's this volcano.

4254
03:23:02.397 --> 03:23:03.577
MATT: No.

4255
03:23:03.577 --> 03:23:05.734
The one you're talking about is much further south.

4256
03:23:05.734 --> 03:23:06.748
Well no, sorry.

4257
03:23:06.748 --> 03:23:09.194
Sorry, Rumblecusp was where he was saying,

4258
03:23:09.194 --> 03:23:10.810
you were convincing him about this volcano,

4259
03:23:10.810 --> 03:23:11.881
so it might work out.

4260
03:23:11.881 --> 03:23:13.759
We'll see how the conversation goes.

4261
03:23:13.759 --> 03:23:16.341
You got a few more weeks before that happens.

4262
03:23:16.341 --> 03:23:18.265
You got like, I'll look at the timer again,

4263
03:23:18.265 --> 03:23:19.883
but I think you have like two months or so.

4264
03:23:19.883 --> 03:23:21.743
SAM: You got to register for your badge like right away.

4265
03:23:21.743 --> 03:23:22.776
MATT: Exactly, it's real fast.

4266
03:23:22.776 --> 03:23:24.208
LAURA: Yeah, I know, yeah.

4267
03:23:24.208 --> 03:23:25.699
MARISHA: Hotel rooms go fast,

4268
03:23:25.699 --> 03:23:27.449
you got to get in that lottery.

4269
03:23:27.449 --> 03:23:30.028
LIAM: On Ebay for like, so much gold.

4270
03:23:30.028 --> 03:23:31.391
MARISHA: I know.

4271
03:23:31.391 --> 03:23:33.013
We'll just keep the swag bag--

4272
03:23:33.013 --> 03:23:35.621
TALIESIN: No, this is fantasy realm, it's ye-bay.

4273
03:23:35.621 --> 03:23:38.381
(groaning)

4274
03:23:38.381 --> 03:23:39.535
LIAM: Taliesin!

4275
03:23:39.535 --> 03:23:42.336
SAM: Boo! That's a Sam Riegel-worthy joke.

4276
03:23:42.336 --> 03:23:43.548
MATT: That was.

4277
03:23:43.548 --> 03:23:45.387
That definitely was.
TALIESIN: I am so sorry.

4278
03:23:45.387 --> 03:23:47.057
MATT: Oh, man, all righty, cool.

4279
03:23:47.057 --> 03:23:50.591
Well, we will be back here next week, Thursday as well.

4280
03:23:50.591 --> 03:23:53.066
We'll see those of you who are coming up to come Comic-Con

4281
03:23:53.066 --> 03:23:55.727
this Saturday at our panel, in the afternoon.

4282
03:23:55.727 --> 03:23:57.630
In the meantime, have a wonderful week,

4283
03:23:57.630 --> 03:24:00.862
we love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

4284
03:24:00.862 --> 03:24:02.188
Good night, guys.

4285
03:24:02.188 --> 03:24:07.038
[dramatic music]

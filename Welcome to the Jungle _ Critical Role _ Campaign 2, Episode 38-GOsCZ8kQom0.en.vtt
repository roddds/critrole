00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.996
MATT: Hello everybody, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:09.036
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Before we hop into tonight's

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:13.036
episode, let's get through some announcements very
quickly. First and foremost, we have our fantastic

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:20.890
returning sponsor, our friends since the beginning
of Campaign 2, D&amp;amp;D Beyond. Sam!

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:25.925
SAM: D&amp;amp;D Beyond just released-- this is actually
kind of exciting-- just released the new Creatures

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:33.442
section. Users now have a place to add any type of
monster stat block for easy reference during play!

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:39.255
You can add your favorite wild shape or familiar
forms, keep up with your ranger's companion,

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:44.124
summoned creatures, mounts, ferrets-- or what do
we have, a weasel?

00:00:44.124 --> 00:00:45.464
LAURA: Yeah!

00:00:45.464 --> 00:00:50.139
SAM: Followers and more! You can also track hit
points and customize the name and stats for all of

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:57.023
your creatures! To celebrate, I've crafted a quick
little trivia quiz for Laura! We'll start with

00:00:57.023 --> 00:01:04.134
Laura and bounce around. I searched through D&amp;amp;D
Beyond's list of actual familiars listed on their

00:01:04.134 --> 00:01:10.589
site. I will name four creatures. One of these is
actually a board game. The other three are actual

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:20.730
D&amp;amp;D familiars. Which is the board game and not a
familiar? A) Boggle, B) Juiblex, C) Pudding King,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.492
D) Unstable Unicorns.

00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:23.845
LAURA: Boggle!

00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:30.066
SAM: Incorrect. I said, "Which is a board game and
NOT a familiar?" Boggle is also a familiar!

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:34.860
Unstable Unicorns is the correct answer.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.669
LAURA: It's stupid!

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:41.465
SAM: Taliesin, one of these is a West Hollywood
bar--

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:43.142
TALIESIN: Ready!

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:49.506
SAM: Three of these are D&amp;amp;D familiars. Which is
the real bar? The Naughty Pig, the Mantrap, the

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:51.836
Steel Predator, the Cockatrice.

00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:53.648
TALIESIN: Which of these is--

00:01:53.648 --> 00:01:56.235
SAM: Is a real bar!

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:57.746
TALIESIN: The Naughty Pig.

00:01:57.746 --> 00:01:59.897
SAM: Correct!

00:01:59.897 --> 00:02:01.972
TALIESIN: I know my West Hollywood bars, man.

00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:03.863
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:11.961
SAM: Marisha, one of these is an Australian candy.
The other are beasts on the list. Which is the

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:19.277
real Australian candy? (Australian accent) A
nalfeshnee? Musk stick?

00:02:19.277 --> 00:02:20.968
TRAVIS: All of Australia is turning off.

00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:23.911
SAM: Ochre jelly? Vegepygmy?

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.290
MARISHA: What was the last one?

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.269
SAM: Vegepygmy.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.463
TRAVIS: No, that's not a familiar.

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:33.272
MARISHA: What's B?

00:02:33.272 --> 00:02:38.745
SAM: Musk stick. You got it correct! It's actually
a candy from Australia!

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:40.292
TRAVIS: Vegepygmy is a familiar?

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:41.728
MATT: Vegepygmy is legit.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:45.746
SAM: I'm going to skip the next one and go
straight to Travis. Sorry, Liam, you lose. No,

00:02:45.746 --> 00:02:51.839
I'll do Liam's, too! One of these is a Kama Sutra
position. The other three are beasts! Which is a

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:56.632
Kama Sutra position? The Flying Snake, the Curled
Flower--

00:02:56.632 --> 00:02:58.025
LIAM: The Cold Flower?

00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:02.746
SAM: Curled Flower. The Stench Cow, or the Corpse
Flower?

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:04.185
LIAM: Which one is the--

00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:06.678
SAM: Kama Sutra's sexy position.

00:03:06.678 --> 00:03:08.148
LIAM: Which one is?

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:09.655
SAM: Yeah.

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.481
LIAM: Run through those really fast.

00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:14.386
SAM: Flying Snake! Curled Flower! Stench Cow!
Corpse Flower!

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:16.112
LIAM: Oh god, too fast.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.349
TRAVIS: You got it, pick one!

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.679
LIAM: Corpse Flower. It's the only thing I can
remember. He said it too fast!

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:28.945
SAM: Curled Flower is-- Speed round! I'm still
going! Travis, I'm going to say pairs of names.

00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:35.065
One of each is a World Wrestling Entertainment
wrestler, the other is a D&amp;amp;D familiar. Grung or

00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:41.508
Mojo Rawley? Say the one that's the wrestler.
Grung or Mojo Rawley?

00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:42.778
TRAVIS: Grung.

00:03:42.778 --> 00:03:46.208
SAM: No. Manshoon or Fandango?

00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:47.510
TRAVIS: Manshoon!

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.074
SAM: No. Leucrotta or Lou Albano?

00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:53.938
TRAVIS: Lou Albano.

00:03:53.938 --> 00:03:58.490
SAM: Correct. Annis hag or Gran Metalik?

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.018
TRAVIS: Gran Metalik.

00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:04.774
SAM: Correct, and one more: Giff or Mirt? They're
both beasts!

00:04:04.774 --> 00:04:10.587
MATT: I don't think Mirt would appreciate being
called a beast.

00:04:10.587 --> 00:04:13.124
SAM: I don't know what any of these things are!

00:04:13.124 --> 00:04:19.736
MATT: But a familiar, perhaps. Thank you, Sam, and
thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:26.235
SAM: I did a lot of research on D&amp;amp;D Beyond today.
It was fascinating to scroll through the list of

00:04:26.235 --> 00:04:27.955
beasts and familiars!

00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:31.434
TALIESIN: I'm especially impressed you found the
list of West Hollywood bars on D&amp;amp;D Beyond. That's

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:33.537
an obscure crowd.

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:43.340
MATT: It's amazing the reach the program has now.
Thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond, for your sponsorship. Gotta

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.999
catch 'em all. A couple of other updates: the
latest episode of Between the Sheets starring our

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:55.444
fantastic Liam O'Brien right here is now available

00:04:55.444 --> 00:04:57.783
youtube.com/criticalrole.

00:04:57.783 --> 00:05:03.186
MATT: Make sure to check out this coming Monday on

the Sheets with our fantastic Sam Riegel.

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:08.856
SAM: I'm on this show?

00:05:08.856 --> 00:05:10.677
MATT: You're up the next week, yeah, get ready.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.065
SAM: Did they pay me?

00:05:12.065 --> 00:05:14.305
MATT: That would be a conversation to have with
the Creative Director.

00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:20.116
SAM: Brian has to pay me to be anywhere within 500
feet of him. It's the rule.

00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:25.012
MATT: I think legally you're not supposed to be?
Check that out on Monday, 7:00pm Pacific on our

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:30.506
Twitch channel, and the next episode of All Work

as well as the special guest, Stephanie Sheh.

00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:39.692
SAM: We're doing the rage room tomorrow.

00:05:39.692 --> 00:05:42.445
ALL: Rage room!

00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:44.085
SAM: It's going to be fun.

00:05:44.085 --> 00:05:46.212
LIAM: Got almost all of it out.

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:49.090
MATT: (slow motion talking)

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.432
TRAVIS: Benadryl.

00:05:51.432 --> 00:05:55.248
MATT: So there's that. Anybody else have any other
announcements?

00:05:55.248 --> 00:06:03.145
LAURA: The pre-orders for the Keyfish t-shirt
start shipping tomorrow. Outside of that, just go

00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:05.022
to the shop. Y'all know the drill.

00:06:05.022 --> 00:06:06.742
MARISHA: It's fine, we're gods!

00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:12.280
MATT: All right then. Without further ado, I say
it's time we go ahead and dial in for tonight's

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.990
episode of Critical Role.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.993
[TV static, click]

00:06:20.993 --> 00:07:38.731
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:07:39.828 --> 00:07:42.453
MATT: And welcome back.

00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:44.396
TALIESIN: Never an accident.

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:51.709
MATT: No, never! Last we left off: The Mighty
Nein, following their thread of information, in

00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:58.867
pursuit of the source of the strange sphere that
Fjord had come into the possession of-- that

00:07:58.867 --> 00:08:04.388
seemed to tie in some way, shape or form to the
magical powers he had been slowly learning to

00:08:04.388 --> 00:08:11.153
control and manifest-- led you to southward to the
Menagerie Coast where you commandeered a ship

00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:16.163
named the Mist, which you then renamed the
Mistake, hired a crew and made your way

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:25.959
south-southeast towards the island of Urukaxl to
follow the apparent source of this note that

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:32.397
seemed to have some information about where it was
from and where it may go. Upon approaching, you

00:08:32.397 --> 00:08:37.381
were greeted by a much larger ship, which had shot
a warning shot across the bow and demanded you to

00:08:37.381 --> 00:08:44.510
come meet the captain on their deck. You there met
Captain Avantika, who had given you the options of

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:52.117
either proving yourselves beneath her and her crew
by helping them, putting yourself in danger at her

00:08:52.117 --> 00:09:00.184
behest, or they would weigh your corpses down with
rocks within the nearby bay amongst the reefs. You

00:09:00.184 --> 00:09:08.419
agreed to give into these demands and an evening's
stay within the ship known as the Squalleater. A

00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:16.068
little bit of thievery went into the cargo hold of
the ship while Fjord had been called to the

00:09:16.068 --> 00:09:22.107
captain's quarters, where the two of you
discovered that you had something in common. You

00:09:22.107 --> 00:09:31.940
both appeared to have been, from her words, the
chosen of Uk'otoa, an ancient entity referred to

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:40.122
as the leviathan that was a historical creation of
Zehir, the Cloaked Serpent, before it was banished

00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:46.852
along with the rest of the gods in the Calamity
and following Divergence. Now the captain, seeing

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:54.735
herself as the chosen and seeing you in a similar
state -- this kismet was grappled onto quite

00:09:54.735 --> 00:10:00.792
strongly by her-- sent you to bed with the
excitement of this travel, of which you would

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:03.431
embark upon in the next day.

00:10:03.431 --> 00:10:11.191
MATT: Upon waking, you found that Jamedi, a hired
adventurer and dungeoneer who was set out to scope

00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:18.353
the island and find this temple, this supposed
structure that was built in honor of Uk'otoa long

00:10:18.353 --> 00:10:26.734
ago and had since been retaken by followers of the
Cloaked Serpent. Jamedi returned, finding the rest

00:10:26.734 --> 00:10:32.372
of the path too dangerous, but had managed to
locate the whereabouts of this temple. Now you've

00:10:32.372 --> 00:10:38.263
gathered your things, you left the Squalleater
onto a couple of skiffs, rowed yourself onto the

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:47.337
white beach shores of Urukaxl, and as you all step
across the long beach towards the line of trees

00:10:47.337 --> 00:10:56.222
that makes the jungle, you make your way into this
mysterious wooded area. Mighty Nein, welcome to

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:57.300
the jungle.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.079
TRAVIS: (singing) Welcome to the jungle!

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:07.440
MATT: (singing) You're gonna die! (spoken) As
Jamedi begins pushing forward into this, I would

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.254
like to, one, have a marching order.

00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:10.891
LAURA: That fast, huh?

00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:12.721
MATT: I mean, you guys are going into dangerous
territory.

00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:13.666
TRAVIS: I'll be up front.

00:11:13.666 --> 00:11:16.879
SAM: Yasha's first. We're all 60 feet behind her.

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:19.783
MATT: Fjord's up front.

00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:20.457
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:11:20.457 --> 00:11:22.079
LAURA: I'll be behind him.

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:25.381
MATT: Avantika's going to ride up with Fjord.

00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:28.258
MARISHA: I'll be behind Jester.

00:11:28.258 --> 00:11:36.054
MATT: Jamedi's going to be scouting a little bit
ahead. Nott, where are you?

00:11:36.054 --> 00:11:38.968
SAM: I guess I'll scout with Jamedi.

00:11:38.968 --> 00:11:41.812
TRAVIS and LIAM: Yeah!

00:11:41.812 --> 00:11:45.850
MARISHA: I'll be behind Jester, yeah, or with
Jester.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:51.024
MATT: Yasha will hold up the rear from a defensive
standpoint. Caduceus, Caleb?

00:11:51.024 --> 00:11:53.868
TALIESIN: I'll be toward the back, I guess.

00:11:53.868 --> 00:11:57.103
LIAM: I will walk behind Beauregard.

00:11:57.103 --> 00:11:58.565
MATT: Okay.

00:11:58.565 --> 00:12:07.837
LIAM: Also, question: What is the temperature like
here on this island? Are we tropical at this point?

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:14.082
MATT: You are very much in tropical weather. It is
warm, it is humid, and, even within maybe ten

00:12:14.082 --> 00:12:17.482
minutes of walking into the jungle, you can feel
the sweat beginning to gather at the edges of your

00:12:17.482 --> 00:12:19.142
hair and the back of your coat.

00:12:19.142 --> 00:12:24.119
LIAM: Caleb would then have taken his coat off and
twisted it up and tied it to the back of his coat,

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:28.752
so he's just with the holstered books and his
shirt sleeves rolled up at this point since it's

00:12:28.752 --> 00:12:30.294
so hot.

00:12:30.294 --> 00:12:32.311
MATT: So you're leaving the coat behind?

00:12:32.311 --> 00:12:35.232
LIAM: No, I just tied it onto the back of my pack.

00:12:35.232 --> 00:12:36.598
MATT: Ok, gotcha. Cool.

00:12:36.598 --> 00:12:38.927
LIAM: Rolled it up like a carpet.

00:12:38.927 --> 00:12:47.284
MATT: You begin to step through the soft floor of
the island jungle, each footstep coming with a

00:12:47.284 --> 00:12:53.994
sort of spongy pressure before it hits hard earth,
rock, or just compressed compost and soft

00:12:53.994 --> 00:12:59.031
vegetation. I need you all to roll a stealth check
as a group as you press forward.

00:12:59.031 --> 00:13:03.867
LAURA: Can I cast Pass Without a Trace so everyone
around me gets plus ten?

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.629
TALIESIN: Yeah, might be a good idea.

00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:07.779
TRAVIS: She's nice in the middle for a good
spread.

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:10.129
SAM: May I put up my cloaky thing?

00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:11.266
MATT: Of course.

00:13:11.266 --> 00:13:12.568
TALIESIN: I'm also going to--

00:13:12.568 --> 00:13:13.379
MARISHA: (sneezes)

00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:15.544
ALL: Bless you!

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:17.908
TRAVIS: First roll with the new CR die!

00:13:17.908 --> 00:13:18.905
LIAM: Gesundheit.

00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:22.547
TALIESIN: I'm going to politely ask the local
greenery and let them know that we're going to be

00:13:22.547 --> 00:13:27.206
coming through and that we're going to try not to
disturb them so long as nothing disturbs us.

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:29.125
SAM: Did you cast Pass Without a Trace?

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:30.519
LAURA: Yes, I did!

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:31.894
TRAVIS: Do you do that out loud?

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.154
TALIESIN: Yeah, have to.

00:13:33.154 --> 00:13:34.165
TRAVIS: The local greenery?

00:13:34.165 --> 00:13:37.354
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, I got to talk to a couple
of trees and let them know that we're coming through.

00:13:37.355 --> 00:13:43.734
LAURA: I'm going to give the Blessing of the
Trickster to Fjord.

00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:46.337
TRAVIS: I don't need it, but okay.

00:13:46.337 --> 00:13:48.929
TALIESIN: Thank god for that plus ten because that
was terrible.

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:56.051
MATT: Avantika and Jamedi. Got it. All right,
Caduceus.

00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:57.168
TALIESIN: 15.

00:13:57.168 --> 00:13:58.204
MATT: Good.

00:13:58.204 --> 00:13:59.771
LAURA: 32.

00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:01.180
SAM: We're all within the--

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.936
MATT: 30-foot radius, right?

00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:03.542
LAURA: Yeah.

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:05.774
SAM: Okay, 24.

00:14:05.774 --> 00:14:07.620
LIAM: 26.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.937
MARISHA: 29.

00:14:08.937 --> 00:14:10.107
TRAVIS: 25.

00:14:10.107 --> 00:14:19.452
MATT: I'll roll for Yasha as well. Natural 18, all
right. You guys ever so quietly disappear into the

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:26.082
jungle brush without issue. The hanging vines and
heavy palm fronds around you heavily obscuring

00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:28.779
your procession deeper into this--

00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:33.936
TRAVIS: Caduceus, can I ask you: what do you hear
when you converse?

00:14:35.996 --> 00:14:37.296
TALIESIN: Shh.

00:14:37.296 --> 00:14:39.075
TRAVIS: (whispering) Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:14:39.075 --> 00:14:45.204
TALIESIN: If you want to hear it, you have to
listen for it. You hear that?

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:49.437
TRAVIS: No.

00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:52.023
TALIESIN: What're you hearing, then?

00:14:52.023 --> 00:14:53.407
TRAVIS: Nothing.

00:14:53.407 --> 00:14:56.568
TALIESIN: Exactly, yeah. It's good. All right.

00:14:56.568 --> 00:15:00.321
LIAM: (whispering) They're not saying anything.

00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:01.234
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:09.244
MATT: Continuing onward. Who's keeping watch on
this?

00:15:10.312 --> 00:15:11.349
SAM: Me, and--

00:15:11.349 --> 00:15:13.204
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye out.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:15.184
SAM: Who am I out there with? Cosko?

00:15:15.184 --> 00:15:16.099
MATT: Jamedi.

00:15:16.099 --> 00:15:17.761
TALIESIN: Oh, and Frumpkin.

00:15:17.761 --> 00:15:19.163
TRAVIS: Yeah, and Caduceus please.

00:15:19.163 --> 00:15:20.512
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye around as well.

00:15:20.512 --> 00:15:24.291
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll perception for your
vicinity. You guys are rolling perception for the

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:26.645
path ahead of you.

00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:28.089
SAM: Three.

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:31.251
TRAVIS: What the fuck? Plus?

00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:33.728
SAM: Plus zero.

00:15:33.728 --> 00:15:36.978
TRAVIS: Why are you rolling perception checks?

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.224
SAM: I'm in the front. Makes sense!

00:15:40.224 --> 00:15:42.573
MARISHA: Did you get a haircut?

00:15:42.573 --> 00:15:45.747
SAM: No, I just styled it a little bit differently.

00:15:45.747 --> 00:15:46.640
MARISHA: It looks good!

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.839
SAM: Oh, that's nice!

00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:50.538
TALIESIN: It might have been the loss of your
Samson-like powers.

00:15:50.538 --> 00:15:51.329
MATT: So anyway.

00:15:51.329 --> 00:16:03.084
Bring it in. Pushing forward, you look ahead and
it's just endless trees and hanging vines and

00:16:03.084 --> 00:16:08.933
heavy roots in the ground. You feel nice and
confident in the fact that nothing is catching

00:16:08.933 --> 00:16:14.295
your attention. A hand touches your shoulder and
turns you to the right. It's Jamedi, who goes,

00:16:14.295 --> 00:16:20.196
"Shh. Look at this here. This was the first on
my--" He pulls a small piece of paper and is

00:16:20.196 --> 00:16:26.555
taking notes. "I have not looked further within,
but this was the first marker to our entry

00:16:26.555 --> 00:16:33.715
"inside." As he points over to show you, about a
hundred or so feet off, partially obscured by one

00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:44.111
of the nearby heavy fronds, a dilapidated
driftwood shack, with a frond-thatched roof. He

00:16:44.111 --> 00:16:48.553
looks back to the rest of you as you begin to
approach. "This is the first marker. Do you have a

00:16:48.553 --> 00:16:50.441
"need to stop or do we press on?"

00:16:50.441 --> 00:16:52.738
SAM: You've been past here before?

00:16:52.738 --> 00:16:57.683
MATT: "I've walked through but did not stop.
I do not know if it is safe or not."

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:02.724
SAM: Maybe we should go investigate just in
case there's an early warning system or something,

00:17:02.724 --> 00:17:05.139
and there's someone in there watching us?

00:17:06.762 --> 00:17:10.153
TRAVIS: Yeah. Caduceus, Nott, want to check it out?

00:17:10.153 --> 00:17:11.059
SAM: Us?!

00:17:11.059 --> 00:17:12.027
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:17:12.027 --> 00:17:13.384
TALIESIN: Sure.

00:17:13.384 --> 00:17:14.656
TRAVIS: Such a good idea.

00:17:14.656 --> 00:17:16.374
TALIESIN: That is a really good idea.

00:17:16.374 --> 00:17:21.100
SAM: All right. I'll take a big swig and go
towards it.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.488
MATT: Okay. Jamedi begins to move,
and Avantika puts her hand out and stops Jamedi,

00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:29.745
and goes, "Terribly sorry, but you are more
important on this. You two, you can do this

00:17:29.745 --> 00:17:31.394
"without him?"

00:17:31.394 --> 00:17:33.760
SAM: Yes we can, Captain.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.751
MATT: "Very well. We await your return."

00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:39.164
SAM: We're supposed to be listening to her,
or something. I don't know.

00:17:39.164 --> 00:17:41.201
TALIESIN: All right.

00:17:41.201 --> 00:17:46.539
MATT: The two of you tread on. As you approach,
you get a good look at it. It looks like this hut has been

00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:53.059
untouched in a long while. A lot of the overgrowth
in the jungle has reclaimed the base of the wood.

00:17:53.437 --> 00:18:00.050
A lot of it appears to be driftwood, or ramshackle
planks that have been carved from trees that have

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:06.691
fallen over in the vicinity, or possibly scavenged
from shipwrecks that have washed ashore. It is a

00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:13.939
mismatch of different types of wood and cobbled
materials, but it is a shack. It's probably no

00:18:13.939 --> 00:18:28.446
more than ten-foot by ten-foot, it's not extremely
large. You do see a half-rotted sheet of some sort

00:18:28.446 --> 00:18:34.798
of thick material that blocks the doorway. You see
some holes that have been eaten through it.

00:18:40.104 --> 00:18:42.029
SAM: Want me to go knock, or you?

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:49.906
TALIESIN: Well, we have a choice here.
You're harder to see, I suppose, so there's that.

00:18:49.906 --> 00:18:51.518
SAM: All right.

00:18:51.518 --> 00:18:53.506
TALIESIN: I'll come up with you, though.

00:18:53.506 --> 00:18:57.946
SAM: Okay. I'm going to sneak up and peak through the
curtain.

00:18:57.946 --> 00:18:59.464
MATT: Okay. You get to the curtain and

00:18:59.464 --> 00:19:07.272
the material is a thick-- you can see that it
probably once belonged to a sail or of a heavy

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:14.205
tarp that's long rotted and mildewed, and as you
put your hand to it and tug on it, elements of the

00:19:14.205 --> 00:19:21.911
threads separate a little bit. Peering inside, you
see it's mostly empty. There's a simple cot,

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:27.041
there's a chair, a mildewed leather coat that
appears to be half folded over and thrown in the

00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:33.566
corner, and a small box up on the far end of the
table in the room that's just open; there's no lid

00:19:33.566 --> 00:19:37.917
to it. The whole room smells faintly of rot.

00:19:37.917 --> 00:19:42.340
MARISHA, TRAVIS, and LAURA: (pigeon cooing)

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:42.937
MATT: Shh.

00:19:42.937 --> 00:19:46.358
TALIESIN: I'm going to poke
up and put my head in as well. There's no trap

00:19:46.358 --> 00:19:49.489
doors? Nowhere where anybody could be
hiding?

00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:51.181
SAM: I can look for traps.

00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:54.379
MATT: You can make an investigation check
if you want to go check the interior.

00:19:54.379 --> 00:19:55.451
TALIESIN: I was just curious

00:19:55.451 --> 00:19:57.879
immediately if there was anything I notice; I
wasn't going to--

00:19:57.879 --> 00:20:00.603
SAM: I'll look around for traps
on the floor and stuff.

00:20:00.603 --> 00:20:03.508
TALIESIN: I was going to look around. Actually, if
you're doing that, I'll look around the outside to

00:20:03.508 --> 00:20:05.158
see if anybody's watching us.

00:20:05.158 --> 00:20:07.279
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:08.517
SAM: Investigation?

00:20:08.517 --> 00:20:09.416
MATT: Yep.

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:10.941
SAM: 13.

00:20:10.941 --> 00:20:12.774
TALIESIN: 27.

00:20:12.774 --> 00:20:21.400
MATT: Glancing around the space, you see half of
your party hiding, mostly, not too far off, maybe

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:27.484
a hundred feet from the edge. Looking around you,
you notice there are a few animals that are up in

00:20:27.484 --> 00:20:36.534
the top of the trees, leaping. Looks to be some
sort of monkey-type creature, small, leaping from

00:20:36.534 --> 00:20:42.939
branch to branch. You see a few colorful jungle
birds that are up in the higher elements of the

00:20:42.939 --> 00:20:51.126
tree tops. At the moment, no noticeable dangerous
figures that could be lurking nearby.

00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:52.678
TALIESIN: Nothing's really watching.

00:20:52.678 --> 00:20:53.099
MATT: Yeah.

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:54.460
TALIESIN: All right.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:04.877
MATT: Looking about, touching the floor, you don't
notice any trap doors. You find one plank that

00:21:04.877 --> 00:21:12.842
feels loose. You pull it up, and it's just dirt.
Yeah, it's just the table, the cot, the open box.

00:21:12.842 --> 00:21:17.596
SAM: Then I'll use Mage Hand to reach up for that
box and grab it off the shelf.

00:21:17.596 --> 00:21:26.121
MATT: Okay. You pull the box off the shelf and
pull it over. It has a bunch of old, dry-rotted

00:21:26.121 --> 00:21:37.627
navigation tools. You can see a wooden handled
magnifying glass. You can see a piece that held an

00:21:37.627 --> 00:21:44.049
instrument that was used for charting paths along
maps, but the wooden elements of these have warped

00:21:44.049 --> 00:21:48.781
over time and dried out and there are metallic
bits are rusted a bit.

00:21:48.781 --> 00:21:52.485
SAM: Does the magnifying glass look like it might
still work, maybe?

00:21:52.485 --> 00:21:56.191
MATT: It could still work. The glass hasn't been
touched; the housing for it has rusted a little.

00:21:56.191 --> 00:22:02.712
SAM: I'll grab that. Mr. Clay, should we go in
further, or what do you think?

00:22:02.712 --> 00:22:08.320
TALIESIN: I don't know. Has the bed been slept in?
Does it seem like someone's been here recently or

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.816
is this abandoned, do you think?

00:22:09.816 --> 00:22:11.775
SAM: Why don't you go check it out?

00:22:11.775 --> 00:22:14.441
TALIESIN: What? Oh! Well, I'll put my head in.

00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:16.279
MATT: Roll an investigation check as you inspect
the bed.

00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:18.509
TALIESIN: 16.

00:22:18.509 --> 00:22:21.373
MATT: Looking at the cot, it's a simp--

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:23.305
TALIESIN: 12, sorry.

00:22:23.305 --> 00:22:24.408
MATT: 12. Okay.

00:22:24.408 --> 00:22:26.649
SAM: You don't see the cot.

00:22:26.649 --> 00:22:32.195
MATT: It's a simple cot. It looks like the
material bows in the middle where somebody

00:22:32.195 --> 00:22:38.697
would've slept previously. It's stained from
weather over time. Looking up at the thatched

00:22:38.697 --> 00:22:45.082
roof, it looks like there's probably been a few
storms that have battered it enough to the point

00:22:45.082 --> 00:22:49.429
where it leaks through, and the place itself
doesn't really keep any of the rain at bay, what

00:22:49.429 --> 00:22:54.771
manages to filter down through the treetops
nearby, at least. As you push on it, the material

00:22:54.771 --> 00:23:02.479
tears a bit, and beneath it you see a smaller
chest of some kind.

00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:04.370
TALIESIN: Huh.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:06.483
SAM: What?

00:23:06.483 --> 00:23:08.752
TALIESIN: Does look dangerous to you?

00:23:08.752 --> 00:23:09.749
SAM: The chest?

00:23:09.749 --> 00:23:10.898
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:23:10.898 --> 00:23:12.971
SAM: I can come see if it's trappied.

00:23:12.971 --> 00:23:16.535
TALIESIN: Sure. I'm going to take a step back.

00:23:16.535 --> 00:23:20.315
SAM: I'll Mage Hand check for traps.

00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:21.437
MATT: Okay.

00:23:21.437 --> 00:23:26.079
SAM: Wow, so far today, I've rolled two threes and
three fours.

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:27.532
MATT: Buddy!

00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:29.069
LAURA: Switch that fucking dice out!

00:23:29.069 --> 00:23:30.909
SAM: No, it's going to pay off.

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.446
TRAVIS: Just think, slot machine!

00:23:32.446 --> 00:23:33.438
SAM: 13.

00:23:33.438 --> 00:23:37.813
MATT: The chest is locked; it does not appear to
be trapped.

00:23:37.813 --> 00:23:41.257
SAM: Okay. I'll open it. It's not trapped, for
sure.

00:23:41.257 --> 00:23:44.182
TALIESIN: Be my guest.

00:23:44.182 --> 00:23:47.906
SAM: Well, that's better. 24 total.

00:23:47.906 --> 00:23:49.705
MATT: There you go!

00:23:49.705 --> 00:23:51.975
TRAVIS: Ding ding ding ding!

00:23:51.975 --> 00:23:53.406
TALIESIN: Cherry, cherry, cherry.

00:23:53.406 --> 00:23:54.351
MARISHA: Jackpot.

00:23:54.351 --> 00:24:03.425
MATT: You go ahead. It opens up; nothing seems to
happen. It's relatively small; it's maybe six by

00:24:03.425 --> 00:24:10.084
four inches in size. You slowly pull it open,
moving the cot out of the way. Looking inside,

00:24:10.084 --> 00:24:19.064
immediately you see a small, golden statue, maybe
three inches tall, that is a relatively simple

00:24:19.064 --> 00:24:24.976
carving; it's not extremely detailed. The relief
looks like the head of a cobra with the hood open

00:24:24.976 --> 00:24:35.731
and the jaw open with fangs drawn. Next to that
you see three approximately gold piece-sized

00:24:35.731 --> 00:24:40.303
rubies. They're that big around, but they're
fairly thin.

00:24:40.303 --> 00:24:41.987
LAURA: Ooh.

00:24:41.987 --> 00:24:44.196
SAM: I'll grab them all!

00:24:44.196 --> 00:24:45.694
MATT: Okay.

00:24:45.694 --> 00:24:46.972
LAURA: Ruby buttons!

00:24:46.972 --> 00:24:52.167
MATT: You pull them out. As you do, the weight
that's been distributed outside of the chest

00:24:52.167 --> 00:24:55.489
causes it to slide forward. At that point, you
notice that there is a cord attached to the base

00:24:55.489 --> 00:25:02.735
of the chest. The weight was holding it in place.
As you remove the objects, the chest slides back

00:25:02.735 --> 00:25:07.419
against the wall as whatever cable is attached to
it goes through a loop through the ceiling and you

00:25:07.419 --> 00:25:15.052
feel shifting as a large urn of some kind that is
currently set up inside a thatch roof tips over,

00:25:15.052 --> 00:25:18.234
and begins to just release a payload on top of
both of you--

00:25:18.234 --> 00:25:20.878
SAM: Maybe it's just a silly prank, it's
water.

00:25:20.878 --> 00:25:23.245
MATT: It looks to be a cluster of

00:25:23.245 --> 00:25:29.550
poisonous snakes, dozens of them just stumble down
from above. What do you guys do?

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:30.570
SAM: What do we do?

00:25:31.243 --> 00:25:32.550
LAURA: Leap out of the way!

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.731
SAM: I mean, yeah, I guess I will try to not get
hit by the cluster of snakes.

00:25:37.463 --> 00:25:39.407
MATT: Go ahead and make a dexterity check.

00:25:39.407 --> 00:25:40.797
MARISHA: You got any of that rogue shit?

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.401
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

00:25:44.401 --> 00:25:45.169
SAM: Save?

00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.808
MATT: Yes.

00:25:45.808 --> 00:25:47.554
TRAVIS: (hissing) Save friends!

00:25:47.554 --> 00:25:49.398
SAM: 23 to save.

00:25:49.398 --> 00:25:52.461
MATT: You duck out of the way to the back,
get your crossbow ready, and look down. The snakes

00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:59.209
hit the ground with a sludgy slap. All of these
snakes have long been dead, mostly decomposed.

00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:05.549
SAM: They didn't feed the trap snakes?

00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:09.591
MATT: Apparently whoever was been
handling this hut hasn't been here for a while.

00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:12.777
LAURA: Aw, that's sad.

00:26:12.777 --> 00:26:16.194
TALIESIN: Well, that's just sad, that's, yeah.

00:26:16.194 --> 00:26:18.749
SAM: Do you want them to decompose?

00:26:18.749 --> 00:26:22.914
TALIESIN: I mean, that'd be nice, wouldn't it?

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:24.401
SAM: Maybe?

00:26:24.401 --> 00:26:28.848
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll see if I can start the muck
going in here and maybe get a nice little

00:26:28.848 --> 00:26:31.149
indoor terrarium, I don't know what will happen.

00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:35.022
MATT: Sure, they're still mostly
decomposed. But the weather, at least the

00:26:35.022 --> 00:26:44.243
way it was kept up in there, wasn't conducive to
any heavy jungle fungus, it seems. But you harry

00:26:44.243 --> 00:26:52.214
that along. You, through your cantrip, manage to
watch as these dull blue and gray spores begin to

00:26:52.214 --> 00:26:58.349
apparate in a row across the pile of somewhat
sludgy snake remains.

00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:00.156
TALIESIN: That's already better.

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:03.776
SAM: Were they real rubies or was it all
a ruse to get me to pull on them?

00:27:03.776 --> 00:27:05.456
MATT: They appear to be.

00:27:05.456 --> 00:27:06.973
SAM: Do I have them?

00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:08.924
MATT: You have them. You have
everything that's in the

00:27:08.924 --> 00:27:16.176
chest, you have the gold idol, the small snake
head idol, and you have these three gold

00:27:16.176 --> 00:27:24.402
piece-shaped rubies. They're about that thick, and
that big around. Make an investigation check.

00:27:24.402 --> 00:27:25.040
SAM: Me?

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.021
MATT: Yes. It would be perception, actually.

00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:29.575
SAM: 12

00:27:29.575 --> 00:27:33.202
MATT: You look at the rubies

00:27:33.202 --> 00:27:39.106
as you're inspecting them and they have little
scratches at the edges, it's like slight-- I

00:27:39.106 --> 00:27:43.958
wouldn't say imperfections, it's not like they
were originally there. But you can see small

00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:51.992
grooves or lines along the outer edge where
something metal or pointy was used to scrape or picked.

00:27:51.992 --> 00:27:52.612
SAM: Okay.

00:27:52.612 --> 00:27:58.477
TRAVIS: This is good. This is some Uncharted
shit right now.

00:27:58.477 --> 00:28:03.285
TALIESIN: There are some maps in with the compass--
just some tools? All right.

00:28:03.285 --> 00:28:04.389
MATT: Nothing else. Just a few things left behind,
and no sign of who once built or at least lived

00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:09.991
in this space nearby. But they haven't been
here for a while, whoever they were.

00:28:12.051 --> 00:28:17.067
SAM: Let's go tell the others about everything
that we found, except for all the rubies and

00:28:17.067 --> 00:28:22.965
gold. I'm kidding, we'll tell them about it.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:28.883
TALIESIN: All right, I-- you know, okay,
sure. We can do that.

00:28:28.883 --> 00:28:33.513
SAM: Unless you're cool with not telling them,
because that's cool with me, too.

00:28:33.895 --> 00:28:34.948
TALIESIN: Telling who what?

00:28:34.948 --> 00:28:36.911
SAM: All right, you're confusing.

00:28:36.911 --> 00:28:39.313
LAURA: What did you find, what did you find?

00:28:39.313 --> 00:28:48.091
SAM: I found those beautiful eyes of yours.
I can't-- I found two rubies.

00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:49.072
LAURA: Two whole rubies?

00:28:49.072 --> 00:28:49.845
SAM: Yes.

00:28:49.845 --> 00:28:51.674
LAURA: Whoa, what did they look like?

00:28:51.674 --> 00:28:52.741
SAM: Like this.

00:28:52.741 --> 00:28:54.170
LAURA: Ooh!

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.165
TALIESIN: It'd look even better with the golden
snake thing. I mean the whole thing comes together nicely.

00:28:58.165 --> 00:28:59.382
TRAVIS: What golden snake?

00:28:59.382 --> 00:29:01.127
SAM: Oh, there's a golden snake, I forgot.

00:29:01.127 --> 00:29:01.750
LAURA: Ooh!

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.873
TRAVIS: Is it just a cobra head by itself, or is there
also a body?

00:29:04.873 --> 00:29:10.950
MATT: No, it's just a head, about an inch below where
the jaw opens. It's about three inches tall altogether.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.945
LAURA: Is it like our little mini Yasha bust?

00:29:12.945 --> 00:29:17.682
MATT: Kind of, yeah! Only with no
torso. It's just like a snake head that's curled

00:29:17.682 --> 00:29:19.666
up, and it's only from about there to where the
mouth is.

00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:22.146
LAURA: I try to feed the ruby to the snake head.

00:29:22.146 --> 00:29:25.124
LIAM: May I have a look at this one?
Not the rubies.

00:29:25.124 --> 00:29:30.293
LAURA: Do I see anything cool about the rubies?
Do I also see the little (scratching)?

00:29:30.293 --> 00:29:32.074
MATT: You do also notice the small scrapes, yes.

00:29:32.074 --> 00:29:35.983
LIAM: Are there any runes on this
thing, does it seem arcane in nature?

00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:43.019
MATT: It does not appear to have any runes inscripted on
it. There's no language carved or pressed into the

00:29:43.019 --> 00:29:53.303
mold. It looks to be like it was sculpted not by a
master artist or sculptor. Some of the details are

00:29:53.303 --> 00:29:58.711
a little loose and bleed a bit: where the mouth
and the teeth are some of them are a little bent

00:29:58.711 --> 00:30:04.425
or off-kilter. It looks like it was more of a
passion project than a fine piece of craftsmanship.

00:30:04.425 --> 00:30:10.350
LIAM: Yeah, how does everyone feel about a
ten-minute breather here? I sit down and unholster

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:14.057
my book and begin to cast Identify as a ritual.

00:30:14.057 --> 00:30:16.508
MARISHA: Hey, can you do that on multiple things
at a time?

00:30:16.508 --> 00:30:18.227
LIAM: No. One at a time.

00:30:18.227 --> 00:30:20.498
MARISHA: That seems excessive.

00:30:20.498 --> 00:30:22.923
SAM: What do you have that you want to identify?

00:30:22.923 --> 00:30:25.119
LIAM: Do you have a quicker way?

00:30:25.119 --> 00:30:27.312
MARISHA: Just a thing that was given to me.

00:30:27.312 --> 00:30:28.955
LAURA: What thing was given to you?

00:30:28.955 --> 00:30:32.071
MARISHA: A feather from Nila, forever ago.

00:30:32.071 --> 00:30:34.137
LIAM: It's only ten minutes.

00:30:34.137 --> 00:30:35.333
SAM: You don't trust her?

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:36.551
LAURA: Who's Nila?

00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:38.675
MARISHA: I don't know, I'm just saying it might be
magical.

00:30:38.675 --> 00:30:39.754
TALIESIN: Magic feather.

00:30:39.754 --> 00:30:42.494
MARISHA: Magic feather. Maybe it makes me fly.

00:30:42.494 --> 00:30:46.969
TALIESIN: Maybe it makes you fly, maybe it makes
you molt. There's all sorts of things feathers

00:30:46.969 --> 00:30:47.647
could do.

00:30:47.647 --> 00:30:49.493
MARISHA: Oh that's right, you didn't meet Nila.

00:30:49.493 --> 00:30:50.848
LAURA: Nuh-uh.

00:30:50.848 --> 00:30:54.646
MARISHA: Yeah, she looked like Caduceus.

00:30:54.646 --> 00:30:56.281
TALIESIN: She was really nice.

00:30:56.281 --> 00:30:56.975
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:30:56.975 --> 00:30:59.794
TALIESIN: We didn't look anything alike, but yeah
she was very nice.

00:30:59.794 --> 00:31:00.867
MARISHA: Oh sorry.

00:31:00.867 --> 00:31:02.278
TALIESIN: I'm much taller.

00:31:02.278 --> 00:31:05.805
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can take ten minutes, we'll set
out a little perimeter just to make sure we

00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:08.025
deflect any unwanted--

00:31:08.025 --> 00:31:16.827
LAURA: I mean if Avantika thinks it's okay. Does
Captain Avantika think it's okay for us to take

00:31:16.827 --> 00:31:18.317
ten minutes?

00:31:18.317 --> 00:31:23.751
MATT: Captain Avantika crosses her arms and
impatiently goes "Whatever it takes if you think

00:31:23.751 --> 00:31:26.802
"it will give us there safer. I trust you and your
specialties."

00:31:26.802 --> 00:31:28.376
LAURA: Okay.

00:31:28.376 --> 00:31:34.899
SAM: Hey is there any benefit to showing-- I
whisper-- is there any benefit to showing

00:31:34.899 --> 00:31:38.730
Captain Avantika that letter we found that she
wrote?

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:44.280
LAURA: Hmm, we should ask Fjord before we do
that.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.862
SAM: All right. What's Fjord doing right now?

00:31:49.862 --> 00:31:53.923
(laughter)

00:31:53.923 --> 00:31:55.210
SAM: (yelling) Hey Fjord!

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:55.714
TRAVIS: Huh?

00:31:56.355 --> 00:31:58.831
SAM: (yelling) Fjord! (spoken) I whisper.

00:31:58.831 --> 00:32:02.127
(laughter)

00:32:02.127 --> 00:32:07.246
SAM: Is there any benefit to showing Captain
Avantika the letter that I think she wrote?

00:32:07.246 --> 00:32:09.259
TRAVIS: Why would we do that?

00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:17.866
SAM: I don't know. That's why I'm asking. I'm a
simple goblin. I don't know the world weary ways

00:32:17.866 --> 00:32:19.032
of a sailor.

00:32:19.032 --> 00:32:22.013
TRAVIS: You certainly could. I don't see what harm
it could bring.

00:32:22.013 --> 00:32:24.618
LAURA: I'm still picturing you in the stripy
sailor outfit.

00:32:24.618 --> 00:32:26.739
TRAVIS: Sure, go for it.

00:32:26.739 --> 00:32:34.126
SAM: No, I'll just hang on to it. If she ever is
like, I don't know. If we ever need it, we got it!

00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:36.322
MARISHA: I walk over. Hey, are we whispering?

00:32:36.322 --> 00:32:38.687
LAURA: Shh. We're whispering.

00:32:38.687 --> 00:32:41.012
MARISHA: Oh sorry. Sorry, we're whispering.

00:32:41.012 --> 00:32:47.270
SAM: Never mind, we were just talking about this
letter, but don't show Avantika. We can use it to

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.892
copy her handwriting and write a check.

00:32:49.892 --> 00:32:53.736
MARISHA: You never show people their stolen mail.

00:32:53.736 --> 00:32:57.040
SAM: Oh, of course, I should have asked you
first!

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.223
MARISHA: Don't. Absolutely not. Keep that shit on
lock.

00:33:01.223 --> 00:33:08.288
TRAVIS: He's rolling dice, you guys. Is the shack
large enough to house our entire?

00:33:08.288 --> 00:33:10.796
MATT: Not comfortably, by any means.

00:33:10.796 --> 00:33:12.491
TRAVIS: We'll kind of--

00:33:12.491 --> 00:33:16.307
LAURA: We'll be quiet, we'll just stay still and
look around.

00:33:16.307 --> 00:33:29.056
MATT: In this ten minutes, the blanketed heat and
humidity this jungle tends to hold in is

00:33:29.293 --> 00:33:34.937
uncomfortable for those of you more used to the
northern elements of this continent.

00:33:34.937 --> 00:33:36.511
LIAM: Yeah, this sucks.

00:33:36.511 --> 00:33:40.660
MATT: The sweat is definitely collecting beneath
all of your armor and clothing, pooling in areas

00:33:41.067 --> 00:33:48.647
you hadn't expected. Your hair is matted against
your face, the insects are starting to find their

00:33:48.647 --> 00:33:56.431
way to you as the scent of sweaty humanoid draws
them nearby, occasionally being bit here and

00:33:56.431 --> 00:34:05.023
there. You finish casting Identify. This is not
magical, it doesn't have any magical properties.

00:34:05.023 --> 00:34:12.912
It seems to be just an idol, it looks like it was
attached to something in the past, but it's

00:34:12.912 --> 00:34:15.762
probably literally worth its weight in gold.

00:34:15.762 --> 00:34:18.860
LIAM: Nott, here's your toy back.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.564
SAM: Thank you.

00:34:21.564 --> 00:34:28.561
TRAVIS: I have a question for you, Matt. Is it
really just us and Avantika and Jamedi?

00:34:28.561 --> 00:34:29.583
MATT: Yeah.

00:34:29.583 --> 00:34:30.574
TRAVIS: And that's it?

00:34:30.574 --> 00:34:31.759
MATT: Yeah.

00:34:31.759 --> 00:34:34.874
MARISHA: I scan the forest. Are we being
followed?

00:34:34.874 --> 00:34:38.325
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:34:38.325 --> 00:34:41.406
MARISHA: Fuck, balls, shit, six.

00:34:41.406 --> 00:34:43.254
MATT: Looks clear.

00:34:43.254 --> 00:34:45.421
MARISHA: So foggy.

00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:54.569
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's the humidity. I walk over to
Avantika and say: Might I ask, you said your men

00:34:54.569 --> 00:35:00.298
are dedicated to this cause as well. How much do
you share with them?

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:08.252
MATT: "I share what is needed. I share with them
the elements of the dreams and visions I've been

00:35:08.252 --> 00:35:17.536
"given. For me it is one thing to have a loyal
crew; it is another to have a crew that has faith

00:35:17.536 --> 00:35:24.281
"in you beyond being just captain. I do not want a
mutiny, and what's more effective than someone

00:35:24.281 --> 00:35:28.814
"that thinks that not only are you a proper
captain, but you are the link to their god?"

00:35:28.814 --> 00:35:30.214
TRAVIS: Very effective.

00:35:30.214 --> 00:35:39.314
MATT: "There are ranging levels of belief, maybe,
but I think with the time we spend together and

00:35:39.314 --> 00:35:47.266
"the willingness to understand the possibilities of
having a captain with such capabilities at their

00:35:47.266 --> 00:35:53.336
"disposal, that-- well, riches are not that far off
on the horizon, eh?"

00:35:53.336 --> 00:35:58.604
TRAVIS: Blind belief is quite remarkable. I'm
assuming you've shown them things to garner some

00:35:58.604 --> 00:36:03.089
level of expectation of your abilities?

00:36:03.089 --> 00:36:08.034
MATT: "Oh, do not misunderstand, I myself have
gutted and cut down dozens of men who have

00:36:08.034 --> 00:36:10.497
"attempted to take my position."

00:36:10.497 --> 00:36:14.615
TRAVIS: I don't doubt it for a moment.

00:36:14.615 --> 00:36:20.883
MATT: "Speaking of which," and she removes her
dagger and rapier and looks about and you can see

00:36:21.041 --> 00:36:28.775
beautiful weapons, very well made and very well
kept. In fact, most of her equipment that she has,

00:36:28.775 --> 00:36:34.146
you can see her fiddling with occasionally to
adjust and clean things as she moves through.

00:36:34.146 --> 00:36:40.559
There's a very forceful intent to make sure
everything is properly placed and well taken care

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:48.775
of on her person. She looks about and goes, "And
as much as we are keeping an eye on us ahead, I am

00:36:48.775 --> 00:36:51.024
"still keeping and eye on all of you, of course."

00:36:51.024 --> 00:36:52.699
TRAVIS: I would expect nothing less.

00:36:52.699 --> 00:36:58.437
MATT: "Because, while I would like to believe this
new-found kinship could make for some very

00:36:58.437 --> 00:37:05.886
"incredible possibilities in the future, you cross
me and this blade will find your heart faster than

00:37:05.886 --> 00:37:07.570
"anything you've seen move."

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:11.217
TRAVIS: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

00:37:11.217 --> 00:37:16.797
MATT: "I hope not either." She reaches out and
pokes your nose and turns around.

00:37:16.797 --> 00:37:18.424
MARISHA: She booped you. Nope.

00:37:18.424 --> 00:37:20.531
TRAVIS: She just gets a finger full of sweat.

00:37:20.531 --> 00:37:23.536
LIAM: Was all of that for all to hear or are they
off a bit?

00:37:23.536 --> 00:37:26.000
MATT: They were off a bit, away from everybody.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.201
TRAVIS: Are we satisfied?

00:37:29.201 --> 00:37:33.569
SAM: Let's go, let's keep going. Oh, what?

00:37:33.569 --> 00:37:35.723
LIAM: Yeah, I'm good. Break time over.

00:37:35.723 --> 00:37:37.215
TRAVIS: All right.

00:37:37.215 --> 00:37:43.218
MATT: "All right. Jamedi?" "Of course." They begin
falling into the same positions, with both Jamedi

00:37:43.218 --> 00:37:47.480
and Nott taking point. Everybody make another
stealth check, please.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.186
MARISHA: Another stealth check.

00:37:49.186 --> 00:37:51.466
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace still going? It goes
for how long?

00:37:51.466 --> 00:37:52.818
MATT: It lasts for an hour.

00:37:52.818 --> 00:37:53.068
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

00:37:53.068 --> 00:37:55.229
MATT: So yeah, it's still going for a bit.

00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:57.259
LAURA: Oh, Blessing, who needs a Blessing?

00:37:57.259 --> 00:37:58.999
MARISHA: (pigeon cooing)

00:37:58.999 --> 00:38:00.789
MATT: Technically it's still on Fjord.

00:38:00.789 --> 00:38:06.120
TRAVIS: I'll take it. Is that advantage? Better.
21.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.477
MATT: 21? Okay.

00:38:07.477 --> 00:38:08.553
MARISHA: 19.

00:38:08.553 --> 00:38:09.679
LIAM: 29.

00:38:09.679 --> 00:38:10.787
SAM: 29.

00:38:10.787 --> 00:38:11.517
LAURA: 22.

00:38:11.517 --> 00:38:12.584
TALIESIN: 17.

00:38:12.584 --> 00:38:20.188
MATT: Okay. All doing pretty damn well. Continuing
to coast forward for the next hour, hour and a

00:38:20.188 --> 00:38:26.345
half or so, following Jamedi's path. You can see
him pulling out notes here and there and looking

00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:33.458
for different things, and occasionally he'll come
upon a heavy palm tree or jungle tree that he's

00:38:33.458 --> 00:38:37.707
marked with a blade and he's keeping tabs on his
marks to follow his path back to where he

00:38:37.707 --> 00:38:44.387
originally found his way. Along the way, the
insects are getting really obnoxious. The buzzing

00:38:44.387 --> 00:38:51.777
itself becoming this low, droning, ever-present
hum, but the bites are getting extremely

00:38:51.777 --> 00:38:57.106
obnoxious. Jamedi acknowledging, once he starts
seeing it more and more, goes, "I did not find

00:38:57.106 --> 00:39:02.513
"them a problem before. Perhaps they seem to enjoy
your flavors more than mine."

00:39:02.513 --> 00:39:03.990
MARISHA: Ew.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.375
LAURA: I'm really tasty

00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:06.584
TRAVIS: And sweet.

00:39:06.584 --> 00:39:09.571
TALIESIN: Are the insects really not bothering him
at all?

00:39:09.571 --> 00:39:12.612
MATT: They're not bothering him really, it seems.

00:39:12.612 --> 00:39:15.340
TALIESIN: Just out of idle curiosity--

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.835
SAM: Is he a human?

00:39:16.835 --> 00:39:18.250
MATT: He's human.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.399
TALIESIN: I'm going to very quickly cast Eyes of
the Grave.

00:39:21.399 --> 00:39:23.151
TRAVIS: Of the what?

00:39:23.151 --> 00:39:28.815
TALIESIN: Anything undead within 60 feet is going
to glow and I'm going to get a little glow off

00:39:28.815 --> 00:39:30.878
anything that registers as undead.

00:39:30.878 --> 00:39:32.222
MATT: Okay.

00:39:32.222 --> 00:39:33.965
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

00:39:33.965 --> 00:39:36.313
SAM: Beauregard starts glowing.

00:39:36.313 --> 00:39:37.332
MATT: You--

00:39:37.332 --> 00:39:39.762
MARISHA: Twist!

00:39:39.762 --> 00:39:47.523
MATT: You get a very faint undead aura emanating
from Jamedi.

00:39:47.523 --> 00:39:50.807
(gasping)

00:39:50.807 --> 00:39:52.244
TRAVIS: You slick motherfucker.

00:39:52.244 --> 00:39:53.808
MARISHA: Still a twist!

00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:59.057
TRAVIS: Really? Out of the fucking blue.

00:39:59.057 --> 00:40:00.508
LAURA: He's good.

00:40:00.508 --> 00:40:03.501
SAM: Do you share this knowledge with anyone?

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:12.203
TALIESIN: At some point when I can get to Fjord
quietly, at some point.

00:40:12.203 --> 00:40:16.333
MATT: All right. Well, first off, I need everyone
to make a constitution saving throw.

00:40:16.333 --> 00:40:18.561
MARISHA: Why? Because it's so hot?

00:40:18.561 --> 00:40:20.546
MATT and TRAVIS: Just make one.

00:40:20.546 --> 00:40:25.065
MARISHA: Jeez, that was so close.

00:40:25.065 --> 00:40:26.138
TRAVIS: 20.

00:40:26.138 --> 00:40:28.603
MARISHA: Nine.

00:40:28.603 --> 00:40:30.823
TRAVIS and LAURA: Nein!

00:40:30.823 --> 00:40:32.484
LAURA: Is that back?

00:40:35.884 --> 00:40:37.685
LIAM: Natural 20.

00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:40.248
SAM: Natural 12.

00:40:41.668 --> 00:40:42.878
LAURA: 12.

00:40:42.878 --> 00:40:44.882
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:40:44.882 --> 00:40:52.388
MATT: All righty! Not bad. Good spread, guys.
Continuing to press on.

00:40:52.388 --> 00:40:57.299
TRAVIS: Somebody cast something, right? Does that
mean somebody cast something?

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:58.838
LAURA: Yeah, it's Jamedi.

00:40:58.838 --> 00:41:02.732
MARISHA: Is it just so hot? What's happening? Is
it bugs?

00:41:02.732 --> 00:41:12.575
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl up to Fjord in the
line at some point. Been keeping my eye out,

00:41:12.575 --> 00:41:22.626
getting the lay of the land and Jamedi is not
quite alive.

00:41:22.626 --> 00:41:24.889
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, did you say not quite--

00:41:24.889 --> 00:41:28.618
TALIESIN: It's not quite alive.

00:41:28.618 --> 00:41:31.480
MARISHA: Am I close enough to where I can overhear
this?

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.063
MATT: No.

00:41:32.063 --> 00:41:38.941
TALIESIN: I don't think it's an appropriate moment
to bring something like that up, but it's worth--

00:41:38.941 --> 00:41:42.408
TRAVIS: Do you detect anything sinister?

00:41:42.408 --> 00:41:44.530
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's not quite alive.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:47.277
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's inherent, sure. Right.

00:41:47.277 --> 00:41:53.428
TALIESIN: If anything, I feel like I'm exercising
an enormous amount of willpower just not to-- I

00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:59.194
mean, just doesn't seem like we're in-- there's a
good advantage to dealing with this now. But,

00:41:59.194 --> 00:42:02.796
yeah, there's something weird there.

00:42:02.796 --> 00:42:07.137
TRAVIS: Thank you for letting me know. I hope
you'll keep an eye on it for us.

00:42:07.137 --> 00:42:10.276
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm keeping an eye on it. Yeah.

00:42:10.276 --> 00:42:11.906
TRAVIS: All right.

00:42:11.906 --> 00:42:19.277
LIAM: I would also say, as we're tromping through,
that I would push forward and try to catch up with

00:42:19.277 --> 00:42:25.917
Jamedi, momentarily. Oh jeez, what is that?

00:42:25.917 --> 00:42:27.128
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:30.639
LIAM: Excuse me, two questions for you.

00:42:30.639 --> 00:42:33.338
MATT: Looks over his shoulder at you.

00:42:33.338 --> 00:42:39.997
LIAM: What's that? How much further? A day's
travel or more than one day until we reach our destination?

00:42:40.112 --> 00:42:47.245
MATT: "With a full group like this, and trying to
be as quiet as possible. I give us about maybe one

00:42:47.245 --> 00:42:52.072
"day. There will be a night of camping along the
way."

00:42:52.072 --> 00:42:54.937
LIAM: And did you encounter any kind of threats?

00:42:54.937 --> 00:43:02.077
MATT: "There are dangerous things in this jungle,
but it is easy to keep out of sight as one man.

00:43:02.077 --> 00:43:07.078
"This many? Well, not as much."

00:43:07.078 --> 00:43:11.147
LIAM: Anything specific that we should be on guard
for or prepared for?

00:43:11.147 --> 00:43:15.833
MATT: "There are lizardfolk that exist on the
outskirts of this island."

00:43:15.833 --> 00:43:16.774
LIAM: You mentioned that.

00:43:16.774 --> 00:43:23.041
MATT: "They call the rivers, streams and the
inlets home. Then there are the people of scale

00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:32.137
"and fang, the snake-folk that exist further in
near this temple. Variations of their strange

00:43:32.137 --> 00:43:37.044
"physical--" What are you guys doing over there?

00:43:37.044 --> 00:43:38.691
SAM: Trying to open candy.

00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:46.090
MATT: How about we hold off? Congratulations.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.396
TALIESIN: That was sort of my fault. I apologize.

00:43:49.396 --> 00:44:01.497
MATT: "The people that have built around this
temple, their variations in how their worship--

00:44:01.497 --> 00:44:11.856
"the boons of this long-gone snake god they worship
seems to apparate on their person in different

00:44:11.856 --> 00:44:21.826
"ways. I've seen some with heads that are full of
serpent features, patches of scales, yellow eyes,

00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:32.076
"as well as some with limbs themselves transformed
into snake-like forms. It is stuff of nightmares."

00:44:32.076 --> 00:44:34.430
LAURA: Like their arms but their legs are just--

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:36.569
LIAM: You avoided them, you did not tangle with
them yourself.

00:44:36.569 --> 00:44:42.482
MATT: "No, that is not the work I do. I am not a
fighter by any means. My job is to not be seen, to

00:44:42.482 --> 00:44:49.346
"infiltrate, recover, and expedite my exit."

00:44:49.346 --> 00:44:57.074
LIAM: Makes sense. I cast Mage Armor right in
front of him on myself. Thank you. See you later.

00:44:57.074 --> 00:45:00.742
I'm going back to my earlier position.

00:45:00.742 --> 00:45:10.649
MATT: All right. Continuing forward for the next
few hours or so, the heat is getting heavier and

00:45:10.649 --> 00:45:18.272
heavier as the afternoon sky now greets you. You
find yourself stopping to eat and drink water

00:45:18.272 --> 00:45:26.945
along the way with what supplies you have
available to you. The next few hours or so as it

00:45:26.945 --> 00:45:28.524
begins to get darker and darker--

00:45:28.524 --> 00:45:29.532
LAURA: I have a question.

00:45:29.532 --> 00:45:29.965
MATT: Yes?

00:45:29.965 --> 00:45:35.053
LAURA: With my medicine stuff, would I know
anything that would help get rid of bugs and

00:45:35.053 --> 00:45:37.998
stuff? That would keep bugs away from me?

00:45:37.998 --> 00:45:42.578
MATT: It's possible. Make a nature check.

00:45:45.141 --> 00:45:47.214
LAURA: Oh no, a natural one.

00:45:47.214 --> 00:45:48.664
MATT: You have no clue.

00:45:48.664 --> 00:45:50.199
TALIESIN: Bugs! How do they work?

00:45:50.199 --> 00:45:56.382
MATT: Not a whole lot of jungle insects in or
around Nicodranas, unfortunately. Nothing catches

00:45:56.382 --> 00:46:02.317
your attention necessarily.

00:46:02.317 --> 00:46:07.039
LIAM: You said it's also darker now? As I chew on
some liquorice root.

00:46:07.039 --> 00:46:10.212
MATT: Yes, it's getting steadily darker as you
guys move your way through.

00:46:10.212 --> 00:46:13.042
SAM: Were there any flowers on our journey?

00:46:13.042 --> 00:46:13.758
MATT: Were there any what?

00:46:13.758 --> 00:46:15.808
SAM: Flowers. Did we pass any flowers?

00:46:15.808 --> 00:46:19.257
MATT: There are a number of jungle flowers that
you pass.

00:46:19.257 --> 00:46:20.927
SAM: I'm going to pick some as we go.

00:46:20.927 --> 00:46:28.726
MATT: Sure, all right. Most of the ones you come
across are like a dull pink in color that fade to

00:46:28.726 --> 00:46:35.591
a green at the base. It's not a vibrant pink, just
enough of that whitish red crossover to appear. A

00:46:35.591 --> 00:46:39.567
lot of them grow along the base of the roots of
some of these jungle trees and you collect a few

00:46:39.567 --> 00:46:45.393
handfuls of them. Okay. Yes?

00:46:45.393 --> 00:46:52.087
MARISHA: I go over to Fjord while we're taking a
break. Hey, did you find anything out from

00:46:52.087 --> 00:46:59.491
Avantika? About, you know, shit that you guys have
in common?

00:46:59.491 --> 00:47:06.365
TRAVIS: No, I asked if she shared with her men her
passions and all the details that she knows and

00:47:06.365 --> 00:47:12.425
all the knowledge. I thought maybe she might covet
that, but it seems like she's quite forthcoming.

00:47:12.425 --> 00:47:17.634
She's trying to build a following, like a zealot
almost. You know, build believers out of her crew.

00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:19.701
MARISHA: Does she believe it, though?

00:47:19.701 --> 00:47:31.891
TRAVIS: Yeah. She's convincing if she's a liar. I
think she genuinely wants to summon forth this thing.

00:47:31.891 --> 00:47:35.553
MARISHA: But does she believe that she's a zealot,
like connected to some god.

00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:39.309
TRAVIS: That she's the chosen? Yeah.

00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:43.347
MARISHA: How are you feeling from last night?
Seemed like you had a rough night.

00:47:43.347 --> 00:47:50.016
TRAVIS: No, I'm fine. Fine. Rested. REM sleep is
some of the best, so you know. I feel energized.

00:47:50.016 --> 00:47:54.628
Jazzed. Excited to continue on.

00:47:54.628 --> 00:48:01.256
MARISHA: All right. Did you ever read any horror
stories as a kid or did you and your friends tell

00:48:01.256 --> 00:48:03.609
horror stories? Spooky things?

00:48:03.609 --> 00:48:06.020
TRAVIS: Ghost stories? Yeah.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:13.799
MARISHA: You know how there's always a time where
the narrator stops, lets your imagination run wild

00:48:13.799 --> 00:48:16.795
with what happens?

00:48:16.795 --> 00:48:18.428
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:28.747
MARISHA: I just wanted to say. People might have
ideas and thoughts, and I'm trying to look out for

00:48:28.747 --> 00:48:37.246
you because we said we'd have each other's backs.
Sometimes the less you say, the more people's

00:48:37.246 --> 00:48:45.646
minds like to fill in the blanks. From what I've
learned, generally, what's in people's heads is

00:48:45.646 --> 00:48:51.313
worse than the reality of the situation.

00:48:51.313 --> 00:49:00.309
TRAVIS: Wow. Do you want to tell me what's in
people's heads?

00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:03.446
MARISHA: I mean, look, we've seen you do some
weird, fucked up shit, right?

00:49:03.446 --> 00:49:04.818
TRAVIS: Admittedly.

00:49:04.818 --> 00:49:11.249
MARISHA: So any time you're unsure it's going to
make other people even more unsure, with a layer

00:49:11.249 --> 00:49:18.562
of suspicion. It's like a tiramisu of confusion.

00:49:18.562 --> 00:49:22.986
TRAVIS: Well, I admit that I'm not sure about a
lot of this. No pressure, right?

00:49:22.986 --> 00:49:27.949
MARISHA: No pressure.

00:49:27.949 --> 00:49:34.049
TRAVIS: I will try to fill in as many details as I
can.

00:49:34.049 --> 00:49:35.783
MARISHA: Let's go fight some snake people.

00:49:35.783 --> 00:49:36.414
TRAVIS: Totes.

00:49:36.414 --> 00:49:38.341
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:49:38.341 --> 00:49:44.207
LIAM: While that is going on, I walk over and
stand next to Caduceus and say: Hey. Hello, would

00:49:44.207 --> 00:49:47.297
you hang out with me for a moment?

00:49:47.297 --> 00:49:48.652
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:52.843
LIAM: Excellent, let's stand right here. I
casually pull out the wire and I cast Message to

00:49:52.843 --> 00:49:58.357
Nott. Nott, would you please go, I need you to
speak to Avantika and Jamedi together for a

00:49:58.357 --> 00:50:00.010
moment, please?

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:04.105
SAM: You need me to speak to Avantika and Jamedi?

00:50:04.105 --> 00:50:05.186
LAURA: What are you saying?

00:50:05.186 --> 00:50:06.016
SAM: Sorry, what?

00:50:06.016 --> 00:50:07.211
LAURA: Are you talking to yourself?

00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:10.302
SAM: Oh. (whispering) I'm on the phone.

00:50:10.302 --> 00:50:12.964
LAURA: Oh.

00:50:12.964 --> 00:50:14.549
LIAM: Ja.

00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:21.043
SAM: Recast. What do you need me to say? You can
respond to this message.

00:50:21.043 --> 00:50:23.627
LIAM: Just distract them, please.

00:50:23.627 --> 00:50:24.558
SAM: Oh!

00:50:24.558 --> 00:50:25.647
LAURA: What did he say?

00:50:25.647 --> 00:50:26.735
SAM: Got it.

00:50:26.735 --> 00:50:27.780
LAURA: What is it? What did he say?

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.672
SAM: (whispering) I'm on the phone right now,
okay? I'll get to you when I'm done.

00:50:30.672 --> 00:50:32.027
LAURA: Okay.

00:50:32.027 --> 00:50:40.474
SAM: (normal volume) Okay. That was Caleb. He
wants me to go distract Avantika and Jumanji for a

00:50:40.474 --> 00:50:43.020
moment. Do you want to come help me?

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.216
LAURA: Okay!

00:50:44.216 --> 00:50:45.824
SAM: What should we do?

00:50:45.824 --> 00:50:48.176
LAURA: Should we do a dance?

00:50:48.176 --> 00:50:49.257
SAM: We've practiced one.

00:50:49.257 --> 00:50:51.870
LAURA: I mean, we did a really good one before. So
yeah. We could do that for them.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:53.292
SAM: We could try to teach it to them.

00:50:53.292 --> 00:50:54.478
LAURA: Yeah!

00:50:54.478 --> 00:51:02.221
SAM: Great. Ahem. Hoy hoy! Hi, Captain Avantika.

00:51:02.221 --> 00:51:03.955
LAURA: And Jamedi.

00:51:04.036 --> 00:51:07.823
MATT: Jamedi's a few feet ahead. He's currently
leading the path. They're about 20 feet from each other.

00:51:07.823 --> 00:51:09.081
SAM: Oh, sorry.

00:51:09.081 --> 00:51:10.750
LAURA: I'll get Jamedi.

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:11.667
SAM: Sure.

00:51:11.667 --> 00:51:13.484
LAURA: Hey, Jamedi!

00:51:13.484 --> 00:51:15.560
MATT: Jamedi is like, "What?"

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.231
LAURA: Can you come here for a second? I have
something I need to show you.

00:51:19.231 --> 00:51:21.982
MATT: "What is this? This has no bearing on--"

00:51:21.982 --> 00:51:25.341
LAURA: It's really important, though. It's super
important.

00:51:25.892 --> 00:51:28.446
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:51:28.446 --> 00:51:32.929
LAURA: Ooh! 22.

00:51:32.929 --> 00:51:36.004
MATT: He goes, (sigh) "What is it?"

00:51:36.004 --> 00:51:42.058
LAURA: Come here, come here!

00:51:42.058 --> 00:51:44.249
SAM: Hi!

00:51:44.249 --> 00:51:46.759
TRAVIS: You can see the temperature rising.

00:51:46.759 --> 00:51:52.613
MATT: (sigh) He begins to walk over in your
direction.

00:51:52.613 --> 00:51:54.865
LAURA: Okay, now that we have you two together.

00:51:54.865 --> 00:51:55.726
SAM: Yes.

00:51:55.726 --> 00:52:00.145
MATT: Avantika' still ten feet from you, but is
like, "What is it you want?"

00:52:00.145 --> 00:52:01.351
LAURA: Okay, we'll do this very quietly.

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:08.930
SAM: Something that-- Hi, it's me, Gilligan. Nice
to see you again. Something that we used to do on

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:13.530
our ship to relieve the tension.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:15.955
LAURA and SAM: And raise morale.

00:52:15.955 --> 00:52:17.863
SAM: Was we had a boat dance.

00:52:17.863 --> 00:52:21.601
LAURA: Yes, and it was specific when we were on
really important missions and stuff.

00:52:21.601 --> 00:52:24.824
SAM: Do you guys have one of those?

00:52:24.824 --> 00:52:30.971
MATT: "Not specific to the dance, no. Not to the
boat, at the very least."

00:52:30.971 --> 00:52:38.949
LAURA: Well, so you have dances, though? Did you
do to raise morale? Do you and Jamedi do one together?

00:52:38.949 --> 00:52:43.630
MATT: Jamedi goes, "This is completely
inconsequential to me and I need to keep an eye on

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:45.150
"the path ahead."

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:49.723
LIAM: After a moment passes, I stand behind
Caduceus' tall frame and quietly cast Detect Magic.

00:52:49.723 --> 00:53:02.686
MATT: Okay. So, you cast Detect Magic. As your
visual aura expands beyond, giving you faint bits

00:53:02.686 --> 00:53:07.784
of essence of magic around you. All of your
friends that have various magical accoutrements

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:17.838
themselves, begin to glow on their persons and
around their persons. You can see that Avantika,

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:24.581
both blades that are currently sheathed give off a
faint aura. That seems to be all that you can

00:53:24.581 --> 00:53:25.802
notice at the moment.

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:27.575
LIAM: Even for Jamedi?

00:53:27.575 --> 00:53:28.878
MATT: Jamedi, you do not see--

00:53:28.878 --> 00:53:31.623
LIAM: Oh, I need to walk up and learn more about
this dance, then.

00:53:31.623 --> 00:53:36.443
TALIESIN: Wait, I'm going to stop you because I
see what you're doing. You're probably not going

00:53:36.443 --> 00:53:41.520
to get anything off him, but he's got an undead
vibe that I've been picking up.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:48.409
LIAM: Oh. Ja verstehen, okay.

00:53:48.409 --> 00:53:54.672
TALIESIN: I feel you. It's been making me pretty
creeped out, to be honest, but I'm trying to hold

00:53:54.672 --> 00:54:00.650
together and keep chill. Chill. Lots of chill.
It's hot, but--

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:02.251
LIAM: I still want to see what he's carrying.

00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:07.872
TALIESIN: You're really going-- Let me know what
you see and we'll compare notes later.

00:54:07.872 --> 00:54:11.415
LIAM: What are you two doing over here? You're
holding up. We need to move.

00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:15.639
MATT: Jamedi's already moving, by the way, he's
ignored both of you and has continued up with the path.

00:54:15.639 --> 00:54:17.503
LIAM: I try to catch up to him!

00:54:17.503 --> 00:54:19.842
LAURA: Oh. We're just showing the dance, is all.

00:54:19.842 --> 00:54:20.512
SAM: Oh, sorry.

00:54:20.512 --> 00:54:22.101
LIAM: I pass them by. Try to catch up.

00:54:22.101 --> 00:54:25.957
MATT: Okay. As you catch up, the next thing you
see as you turn back is Jamedi, hand up behind in

00:54:25.957 --> 00:54:27.565
your direction.

00:54:27.565 --> 00:54:28.500
TRAVIS: Shh!

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.990
SAM: He's a ninja.

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:38.514
MATT: As you all begin to listen, Beauregard,
Caleb, and Caduceus, you hear the cracking of

00:54:38.514 --> 00:54:55.397
branches and twigs and the shifting of jungle
floor. Jamedi puts two fingers in the air and then--

00:54:55.397 --> 00:54:57.455
LAURA: What does that mean? What does two mean?

00:54:57.455 --> 00:54:59.090
TRAVIS: Two people go up.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.550
LIAM: I creep up to just about 30 feet away.

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:04.948
SAM: Don't! Not you.

00:55:04.948 --> 00:55:09.936
MARISHA: I agree. And I walk up.

00:55:09.936 --> 00:55:11.838
MATT: Okay, so Beauregard and Caleb approach.

00:55:11.838 --> 00:55:15.610
MARISHA: No, why are you following me? Why are you
doing this?

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:23.899
MATT: "Shh!" you hear coming from Jamedi. As you
look just past this clearing, you notice a troop

00:55:23.899 --> 00:55:32.497
of four figures making their way through to brush.
You hear this very low, guttural clicking from one

00:55:32.497 --> 00:55:41.854
of them. You can notice these shapes, these
figures in a little bit of the now somewhat fading

00:55:41.854 --> 00:55:51.129
dusk light, they're muscular, and burly, and
hunched. You see scaled skin, but deeply scaled

00:55:51.129 --> 00:55:58.428
all over. Not snake-like, but more lizard-like.
You see long snouts with rows of sharp teeth and a

00:55:58.428 --> 00:56:04.673
frill down the back of the neck. You can see
makeshift bits of leather strapped together to

00:56:04.673 --> 00:56:10.955
form patches of armor across the torso. Big heavy
shields, carved from some sort of a large shell,

00:56:10.955 --> 00:56:18.096
that has multiple rows of spines and hooks down
the back of it. You see clubs and heavy blades

00:56:18.096 --> 00:56:22.730
that are made of makeshift, scavenged metal or
weapons that have washed up on shore or have been

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:27.024
recovered from others that have been unlucky to
make their way to this island and never returned.

00:56:27.024 --> 00:56:27.940
MARISHA: How many?

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:31.346
MATT: Four of them. Each one of them has a spear.

00:56:31.346 --> 00:56:42.919
MARISHA: I duck down, I turn to the rest of the
group, and I say: (whispering) Snake. Four of

00:56:42.919 --> 00:56:45.779
them. Shields. Weapons.

00:56:45.779 --> 00:56:46.849
TRAVIS: That's a bad gesture.

00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:49.530
LIAM: I quickly turn around and through the wire
say: (whispering) There's four lizard people over

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:53.534
here. Looking in the distance at them and at
Jamedi.

00:56:53.534 --> 00:56:54.965
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

00:56:54.965 --> 00:56:56.523
LIAM: Before this spell fades.

00:56:56.523 --> 00:56:59.347
SAM: (whispering) There's four lizard people up
there.

00:56:59.347 --> 00:57:00.325
LAURA: (whispering) Oh.

00:57:00.325 --> 00:57:01.969
SAM: We should do this quietly.

00:57:01.969 --> 00:57:03.689
LIAM: 16.

00:57:03.689 --> 00:57:11.692
MARISHA: I direct the group and I say: You flank
this way, and then you guys flank that way. We

00:57:11.692 --> 00:57:13.555
flank around.

00:57:13.555 --> 00:57:15.246
SAM: Just for fun, but let's try it!

00:57:15.246 --> 00:57:19.723
MATT: Yasha's cupping behind her ear going,
"What?"

00:57:19.723 --> 00:57:22.369
SAM: Yasha and Fjord to the right. We'll go to the
left.

00:57:22.369 --> 00:57:23.341
LAURA: Okay!

00:57:23.341 --> 00:57:30.560
MATT: At this point, you hear a sudden impact.
(growling and impacts) Glancing over, Caleb, you

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:35.772
watch as behind them on the bushes in the opposite
side of this small path they are walking through,

00:57:35.772 --> 00:57:45.979
you see three arrows. Two of these lizardfolk
tumble to the ground to one knee (growling). They

00:57:45.979 --> 00:57:54.967
turn around and two people in purple-ish robes
with basic jewelry and leather bands rush forward

00:57:54.967 --> 00:58:01.904
with daggers and a scimitar in the other hand and
slash out and start hacking. These lizards are now

00:58:01.904 --> 00:58:08.754
being assaulted by these people and behind them,
one burly man with weathered, dark skin, exposed

00:58:08.754 --> 00:58:18.234
chest, and these large, billowing, thick arms that
look like two very long, five-foot serpents that

00:58:18.234 --> 00:58:23.546
come protruding out the sides of the shoulders
into these two separate snakeheads, full with eyes

00:58:23.546 --> 00:58:30.276
and teeth, rush forward and slam, biting into the
throat of one of the lizardmen. He goes (choking)

00:58:30.276 --> 00:58:31.632
and gets pulled to the ground.

00:58:31.632 --> 00:58:33.304
LAURA: Arm snakes? His arm snakes?!

00:58:33.304 --> 00:58:40.475
MATT: His arms are snakes. The two other people
that you see: you see one male, one female. Both

00:58:40.475 --> 00:58:44.940
look human, but in the middle of this chaos you
can see their eyes are bright yellow with the

00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:51.466
serpentine, snake eye slit in the center. Now the
lizard men are pulling up their shields. One of

00:58:51.466 --> 00:58:56.523
them has been carved down on the ground. The one
with the big hand has pulled the throat closed to

00:58:56.523 --> 00:59:02.381
the point where it's slowly dying on the floor.
They have completely gone into this combat between

00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:03.655
the two of them.

00:59:03.655 --> 00:59:05.421
LIAM: Roughly how far away is that fray?

00:59:05.421 --> 00:59:08.988
MATT: It's about 60 or 70 feet. They haven't
noticed any of you here and you are currently

00:59:08.988 --> 00:59:11.781
completely in shadows. What do you do?

00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:14.607
MARISHA: (whispering) I tell them to hold.

00:59:14.607 --> 00:59:16.667
LIAM: Also, do I see anything glowing on Jamedi?

00:59:16.667 --> 00:59:18.307
MATT: No.

00:59:18.307 --> 00:59:19.839
LIAM: Okay.

00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:24.683
LAURA: Do you see anything glowing on any of the
snake people, though?

00:59:24.683 --> 00:59:26.462
MATT: Too far away.

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:28.322
MARISHA: We duck.

00:59:28.322 --> 00:59:29.528
TRAVIS: We're staying put.

00:59:29.528 --> 00:59:33.321
MARISHA: And watching. So it's snakes versus
lizards, right?

00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:34.368
MATT: Yeah.

00:59:34.368 --> 00:59:36.468
SAM: This is the ultimate Godzilla movie.

00:59:36.468 --> 00:59:38.856
TRAVIS: His big arms are five feet? Like, these
big-ass--

00:59:38.856 --> 00:59:46.231
MATT: Yeah. About a foot wide and they spiral
upward and then they snap into giant fangs that

00:59:46.231 --> 00:59:53.266
protrude and snap on each. His face is intense and
grinning. This is a hunting party. One of the

00:59:53.266 --> 00:59:57.588
lizardmen grabs his spear and jams it into the
abdomen of the man with the snake arms. Looks back

00:59:57.588 --> 01:00:02.278
and hisses at him angrily. Manages to pull the
spear free with one of the snake hands, leaps

01:00:02.278 --> 01:00:07.142
over, pole vaulting off the ground, the other
snakehead coming out and snapping into the

01:00:07.142 --> 01:00:11.931
shoulder and chest area of the snakeman and then
throwing him up into the air. You hear (screech)

01:00:11.931 --> 01:00:16.187
as he goes flying, spinning up into the boughs,
lands on the ground. He stands back up, grabs his

01:00:16.187 --> 01:00:23.416
shield, and you can see him woozy. There's this
black color where the impact of the wound was, and

01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:29.488
you see the veins growing dark. It stumbles and
falls onto its knees and then falls to the ground.

01:00:29.488 --> 01:00:32.158
LAURA: Some people got venomous bites.

01:00:32.158 --> 01:00:37.195
TRAVIS: You ever seen an anaconda mouth? There are
lots of teeth in there. It's real bad.

01:00:37.195 --> 01:00:41.764
MATT: One by one, you watch as each of the
lizardmen are felled from the ambush and--

01:00:41.764 --> 01:00:43.376
TRAVIS: Three of the other party.

01:00:43.376 --> 01:00:48.489
MATT: Yes. Two of which looked to be comparably
smaller creatures, but they just weren't prepared

01:00:48.489 --> 01:00:56.041
and while the three snakeman hunting party
appeared to have sustained a few blows and

01:00:56.041 --> 01:00:59.091
injuries, they were successful.

01:00:59.091 --> 01:01:02.140
TRAVIS: The other two only had eyes that seemed
off?

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:07.673
MATT: Correct. As you're inspecting, you can see
patches of skin across their shoulders and a part

01:01:07.673 --> 01:01:17.282
of the chest, you can see scales that appear and
then vanish. With the battle done, the quiet hits,

01:01:17.282 --> 01:01:24.931
and they begin to walk off to a small patch where
they had dropped some sort of a satchel. They

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:30.798
start pulling out rope and they start tying the
legs together of these lizardmen until they have

01:01:30.798 --> 01:01:36.191
two of them tied on one side and the other two
tied ankle-to-ankle on the other. The one with the

01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:40.980
two snake arms picks up both and begins dragging
them behind him in the jungle while the other two

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:46.313
flank and look out into the grass below. They
begin making their way deeper towards the path

01:01:46.313 --> 01:01:52.196
where they came, away from you. Their hunt
successful, they're bringing their meal back with them.

01:01:52.196 --> 01:01:57.425
LIAM: The path that they took away, does it line
up or deviate from the general direction that we

01:01:57.425 --> 01:01:59.471
have been heading in?

01:01:59.471 --> 01:02:02.772
MATT: The direction you've been traveling has been
a little zig-zaggy, because it's been following

01:02:02.772 --> 01:02:07.875
Jamedi's path and the marking he's making, so
you're not entirely certain. It seems it could be

01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:13.156
parallel to the path you're going, but since you
don't know the final destination, you're not

01:02:13.156 --> 01:02:15.915
entirely certain if it'll line up with it or not.

01:02:15.915 --> 01:02:16.682
LIAM: Okay.

01:02:16.682 --> 01:02:18.139
LAURA: (whispering) Jamedi!

01:02:18.139 --> 01:02:22.003
MATT: His hand's still up, he's just watching
carefully. (whispering) "Shh! What?"

01:02:22.003 --> 01:02:24.775
LAURA: Are we following them or are we going a
different way?

01:02:24.775 --> 01:02:27.954
MATT: "We are not to get anywhere near these
creatures."

01:02:27.954 --> 01:02:30.391
LAURA: Good. They eat lizard people.

01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:32.509
MATT: "So I have noticed."

01:02:32.509 --> 01:02:34.235
LAURA: Did you see his arms?

01:02:34.235 --> 01:02:37.689
MATT: "I did. It was quite frightening."

01:02:37.689 --> 01:02:42.964
LAURA: Oh my god. Imagine if it was his legs. How
would he even walk?

01:02:42.964 --> 01:02:46.984
MATT: "It is a very good question. One that will
keep me up late at night."

01:02:46.984 --> 01:02:48.815
LAURA: Yeah.

01:02:48.815 --> 01:02:54.748
MATT: You're not sure if he's joking. Do you guys
do anything else or you just let them pass and

01:02:54.748 --> 01:02:56.259
continue on?

01:02:56.259 --> 01:02:58.218
TRAVIS: We're going to let them go.

01:02:58.218 --> 01:03:01.920
LAURA: Did they leave anything on the ground? Did
they leave anything? Did they drop anything?

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.471
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:03:03.471 --> 01:03:05.872
TRAVIS: The canopy of trees above, right? There's
no sort of--

01:03:05.872 --> 01:03:09.585
MATT: Yeah, it's a thick jungle canopy. It breaks
in places.

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:17.218
SAM: That was the greatest plan we've ever had. We
flanked. The battle was just over!

01:03:17.218 --> 01:03:18.490
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:19.842
LAURA: 11.

01:03:19.842 --> 01:03:21.836
MARISHA: We didn't punch our way through shit!

01:03:21.836 --> 01:03:23.863
TRAVIS: It's a new day.

01:03:23.863 --> 01:03:25.683
MARISHA: Oh my god!

01:03:25.683 --> 01:03:31.306
MATT: Amongst the ground where the battle took
place, you can see there are mashed plants and

01:03:31.306 --> 01:03:39.602
streaks of thick lizardmen blood, a few broken
teeth that are scattered in the sand there, but

01:03:39.602 --> 01:03:41.425
nothing beyond that of value.

01:03:41.425 --> 01:03:42.491
LAURA: I take some teeth.

01:03:42.491 --> 01:03:43.982
MATT: Okay. So you get three lizardmen teeth.

01:03:43.982 --> 01:03:44.672
LAURA: Okay.

01:03:44.672 --> 01:03:51.165
MARISHA: I turn around and I say: Do we have
anything that resists poison or venom?

01:03:51.165 --> 01:03:58.537
LAURA: I have a spell that I took this morning
that will cure poison, but I don't have anything

01:03:58.537 --> 01:04:00.884
that protects from poison today.

01:04:00.884 --> 01:04:02.538
MARISHA: Caduceus, you raised your hand.

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:07.877
TALIESIN: I've got both, but it's best applied
when needed, really. There's only so much to go around.

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:13.224
MARISHA: I feel like maybe with these people we
should have a frontline party and a backline

01:04:13.224 --> 01:04:18.039
party. And maybe a little frontline poison
resistance could be good.

01:04:18.039 --> 01:04:20.318
SAM: So put our two clerics in front?

01:04:20.318 --> 01:04:27.974
MARISHA: No! I don't mind going in front, mainly
because I have no fucking range.

01:04:27.974 --> 01:04:31.021
LAURA: Do we have to keep whispering? Can we
pretend we're still whispering, but let's not

01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:32.602
actually whisper?

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:33.823
MARISHA: Can we do that?

01:04:33.823 --> 01:04:35.524
MATT: It's up to you.

01:04:35.524 --> 01:04:39.898
MARISHA: But if we give the, "We're stage
whispering!"

01:04:39.898 --> 01:04:44.560
TALIESIN: (normal volume) This is my whisper
voice.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:52.120
MARISHA: Just saying, these guys clearly have
reach and I don't think we want to have all of us

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.121
tangle with them.

01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:55.298
SAM: Who do you think should be in front?

01:04:55.298 --> 01:04:56.241
TRAVIS: Yeah, you make a good point.

01:04:56.241 --> 01:04:58.384
LAURA: What if we're in the middle because we're
so heal-y?

01:04:58.384 --> 01:05:00.563
TALIESIN: That's fair. We'll be in the middle just
in case things go wrong.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.965
MARISHA: You're so heal-y, yeah!

01:05:03.965 --> 01:05:06.166
TALIESIN: I'm pretty heal-y.

01:05:06.166 --> 01:05:11.259
MARISHA: I'm not going to volunteer to speak for
anybody, but I know I'm better when I'm up in close.

01:05:11.259 --> 01:05:16.948
TRAVIS: I'll join you. Anybody else? Everybody
else should stay at least 20, 25 feet back.

01:05:16.948 --> 01:05:19.307
MARISHA: Could you give the both of us
resistance?

01:05:19.307 --> 01:05:24.532
TALIESIN: If we get into an altercation, I'll pop
both of you as quickly as possible.

01:05:24.532 --> 01:05:26.998
LAURA: We should have somebody keeping an eye
behind. Did you notice the snake people came up

01:05:26.998 --> 01:05:28.381
behind the lizard people?

01:05:28.381 --> 01:05:30.779
TRAVIS: Yasha should stay with the healers for
sure.

01:05:30.779 --> 01:05:35.242
MARISHA: Yasha can look behind. (whispering)
Yasha! Behind!

01:05:35.242 --> 01:05:38.326
MATT: "I-- I have been."

01:05:38.326 --> 01:05:44.013
TRAVIS: The whole time! You, me, Jamedi, and
Avantika in the front.

01:05:44.013 --> 01:05:47.332
LAURA: Avantika's in the front? With you?

01:05:47.332 --> 01:05:48.410
TRAVIS: Is that all right?

01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:50.021
LAURA: Whatever.

01:05:50.021 --> 01:05:53.314
(laughter)

01:05:53.314 --> 01:05:59.863
LIAM: I have been spending this entire debate
looking north and remembering everything that I

01:05:59.877 --> 01:06:04.500
saw on the way here from the boat and just
calculating an exit strategy, because I remember

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.629
the things that I saw on the way here.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:13.120
MATT: Good to know. Now that enough time has
passed and Jamedi feels comfortable he puts his

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:20.180
hand down and goes, "All right, we press forward.
Follow me, I feel we'll have to make camp soon.

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:26.933
"There is a ruin in front that might give us some
cover." Continuing on?

01:06:26.933 --> 01:06:31.851
LAURA: Jamedi, what if it was his dick that was
the snake though?

01:06:31.851 --> 01:06:39.380
MATT: He keeps his eyes trained forward but goes,
"I imagine it would be difficult to relieve oneself."

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.474
LAURA: Probably.

01:06:42.474 --> 01:06:44.887
LIAM: (shouting) Or masturbate!

01:06:44.887 --> 01:06:55.260
MATT: He turns around and goes, "Shh! It is a
valid point, but I need you to be quiet, please."

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.077
LIAM: Good riddance.

01:06:58.077 --> 01:07:07.328
MATT: Continuing on, the sun sets, and the sky
goes through its cycle of oranges to pinks to

01:07:07.328 --> 01:07:20.324
purples to blues. You haven't quite reached this
aforementioned ruin before night falls. Now the

01:07:20.324 --> 01:07:26.486
evening insects begin to grow louder and louder.
The nocturnal creatures begin to let out the

01:07:26.486 --> 01:07:35.623
nocturnal calls. The perpetual din of the various
clicks and cricket noises and other various

01:07:35.623 --> 01:07:41.039
flapping insects' mating calls into the night
become this constant droning sound around you.

01:07:41.039 --> 01:07:46.232
While the insect bites have subsided, this sound
itself is uncomfortable. For those of you who are

01:07:46.232 --> 01:07:53.150
used to more comfortable sleep, you begin to dread
the possibility of finding a night's rest in this.

01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:58.567
LAURA: Caleb, if you do the bubble thing, can the
insects come in the bubble? Can you make it?

01:07:58.567 --> 01:08:01.905
TRAVIS: Well, Jester, doesn't it glow?

01:08:01.905 --> 01:08:07.883
LIAM: No, I'm able to affect its color and have it
match. It still looks like a very smooth bubble

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:14.550
that is 8-feet tall-- maybe not that big, but it
can match the general color.

01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:16.619
TRAVIS: Just be dark and not attract any other
attention?

01:08:16.619 --> 01:08:18.135
LIAM: Yeah, it does not glow.

01:08:18.135 --> 01:08:20.363
LAURA: Okay, then do it please!

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:24.639
TALIESIN: Yeah-- this is great.

01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:30.512
LIAM: I spend the next 11 minutes, I pull out the
book, unholster it and start doing a ritual cast, ja?

01:08:30.512 --> 01:08:31.897
MATT: Ritual cast of?

01:08:31.897 --> 01:08:34.616
LIAM: Leomund's tiny hut. Is this where we want to
do it, Jester?

01:08:34.616 --> 01:08:36.753
LAURA: This is where we're camping though, yeah?

01:08:36.753 --> 01:08:41.883
MATT: Jamedi says, "Perhaps we wait until we get
to the ruin, just so we have some cover beyond the trees."

01:08:41.883 --> 01:08:44.644
LIAM: Okay, just a little longer then.

01:08:44.644 --> 01:08:47.987
MATT: Who's keeping watch on this first bit of a
night travel?

01:08:47.987 --> 01:08:49.493
TALIESIN: I'll take one.

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:51.785
MATT: All right. Roll perception, as will Jamedi.

01:08:51.785 --> 01:08:56.066
TALIESIN: 21.

01:08:56.066 --> 01:09:02.568
MATT: 21? Okay.

01:09:02.568 --> 01:09:10.099
TALIESIN: I'll pop in the occasional low-level
Light cantrip as far away from us as possible,

01:09:10.099 --> 01:09:14.029
just popping every now and then, if I think I see
something.

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:21.473
MATT: Okay. Following this little chain of lights
that pop and glow as it goes, eventually you come

01:09:21.473 --> 01:09:28.934
upon the first signs of stone rubble. Some sort of
structure was built here long ago, and has since

01:09:28.934 --> 01:09:36.250
fallen over, and elements of its masonry either
moved or reclaimed for other structures elsewhere

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:43.701
on the island, but you can see the basis of walls
and joining positions where elements of this

01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:50.170
previous building were used to maintain and hold
the ceiling that has since fallen in. There is a

01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:59.059
series of walked paths that carved through the
various ferns and heavy bush, but you do find the

01:09:59.059 --> 01:10:04.177
back of one of these walls where Jamedi says,
"This is where I slept previously. Perhaps this is

01:10:04.177 --> 01:10:11.196
"the best place to rest. So--" He begins to set up
a small tent arranging against the wall. What do

01:10:11.196 --> 01:10:13.433
you guys do?

01:10:14.277 --> 01:10:17.458
LIAM: Do we want it just to be us and they have
the tent?

01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:20.134
SAM: Kind of. I mean, is that rude?

01:10:20.134 --> 01:10:22.905
TALIESIN: They didn't bring any tents for us.

01:10:22.905 --> 01:10:28.474
LAURA: But remember that you can hear through the
bubble, remember still, though. Okay. So we can't

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.445
talk bad about them, though.

01:10:30.445 --> 01:10:35.373
TRAVIS: I think maybe we invite them in and one of
us keeps out--

01:10:35.373 --> 01:10:39.565
LAURA: But do it like, "Do you want to stay with
us?" but do it like this.

01:10:39.565 --> 01:10:42.668
SAM: Do you want to ask them with that stink
face?

01:10:42.668 --> 01:10:43.288
LAURA: Yeah.

01:10:43.288 --> 01:10:44.268
SAM: Okay.

01:10:44.268 --> 01:10:53.312
LAURA: Captain Avantika and Jamedi, did you want
to stay with us in the bubble?

01:10:53.312 --> 01:10:55.990
SAM: There's no facilities or anything.

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.993
LAURA: It's stinky in there, but if you want to.

01:10:58.993 --> 01:11:03.150
MATT: Jamedi goes, "I am unfamiliar with what this
bubble is you speak of?"

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:05.530
LAURA: It's whatever. It's a little bubble.

01:11:05.530 --> 01:11:08.204
SAM: It's like a tent.

01:11:08.439 --> 01:11:10.025
LAURA: It's like a tent, basically.

01:11:10.025 --> 01:11:18.129
MATT: "I am okay." He heads back to configuring
his tent. Avantika tilts her head and goes, "I

01:11:18.129 --> 01:11:21.768
"assume this is some sort of protective measure for
your night's rest?"

01:11:21.768 --> 01:11:23.682
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:11:23.682 --> 01:11:26.218
MATT: "Then I would be delighted to join you."

01:11:26.218 --> 01:11:29.551
SAM: I mean, don't feel like you're obligated--

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.150
MATT: "Believe me, it is my honor."

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:34.038
LAURA: Great, cool.

01:11:34.769 --> 01:11:38.871
MATT: Sheathes the rapier, but keeps the dagger
drawn, turned around in her hand so it's face down

01:11:38.871 --> 01:11:47.154
and looks over her shoulder both ways out towards
the darkness. "So how spacious is this?" As you

01:11:47.154 --> 01:11:55.724
finish the spell, the strange, colored orb appears
there on the side of the ruins.

01:11:55.724 --> 01:12:00.262
LIAM: At the surroundings here or what, we're
behind a little bit of stone ruins, or--?

01:12:00.262 --> 01:12:04.201
MATT: Yeah, there's a couple of small stone
elements there.

01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:10.679
LIAM: Then it's gray, the same color as the stone.
I have control of the color. Also out of

01:12:10.679 --> 01:12:15.964
curiosity, I am a transmutation wizard, so do I
have a sense of how old the stone surrounding us is?

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:23.440
MATT: The stone here-- make an intelligence
check.

01:12:25.676 --> 01:12:28.691
LIAM: Ugh, bad roll. 12.

01:12:28.691 --> 01:12:37.526
MATT: You don't have specific information on it.
It's quite old. It might be older than this age,

01:12:37.526 --> 01:12:42.880
might have existed pre-Calamity, or at least
somewhere in that neighborhood. But you're not

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.495
entirely certain.

01:12:44.495 --> 01:12:53.780
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb, want to take a walk, maybe?
Really quickly around this thing, get a gander at it?

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:57.603
LIAM: The thing is, if I exit this bubble now,
then it goes away.

01:12:57.603 --> 01:12:59.966
TALIESIN: Oh, then I'll just report back in a minute.

01:13:00.078 --> 01:13:01.173
LIAM: I could do it again--

01:13:01.173 --> 01:13:05.464
TALIESIN: No, that's okay, better safe than sorry.
I'll let you know when I see.

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:07.610
LAURA: Do you want company? Do you need anyone
with you?

01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:09.890
TALIESIN: Oh, I'd love company, actually, just in
case.

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:18.278
LAURA: Okay. Beau! Nott! (whispering) Keep an eye
on them, okay? Let me know what happens.

01:13:18.278 --> 01:13:19.076
TRAVIS: On who?

01:13:19.076 --> 01:13:21.132
LAURA: Shut up! I mean--

01:13:21.132 --> 01:13:23.299
SAM: On who, our friends?

01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:27.631
LAURA: Yeah, just-- forget it, let's go.

01:13:27.631 --> 01:13:32.863
TALIESIN: We'll take a look around this thing, and
I also want to cast another Detect Undead, while

01:13:32.863 --> 01:13:33.933
we're walking.

01:13:33.933 --> 01:13:34.921
MATT: You're going to look around what?

01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:39.742
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a walk around this
little ruin. I'm going to have the little Light

01:13:39.742 --> 01:13:47.404
spell up, see if there's any writing on anything,
any carvings. I'm going to have Eyes of the Grave

01:13:47.404 --> 01:13:50.249
up again. I'm going to be looking for any undead.

01:13:50.249 --> 01:13:52.223
MATT: Okay. And you're accompanying him?

01:13:52.223 --> 01:13:53.909
LAURA: I'm watching his back!

01:13:53.909 --> 01:13:59.962
MATT: The rest of you are staying within the
sphere, gray color, dimly lit on the interior? It

01:13:59.962 --> 01:14:05.724
can be whatever light source you want at this
point. The two of you wander around the ruin. Make

01:14:05.724 --> 01:14:08.149
an investigation check, if you don't mind.

01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:11.028
LAURA: Can I help? Does that make it easier?

01:14:11.028 --> 01:14:12.882
TALIESIN: You roll too, maybe.

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:17.038
LAURA: Okay. Nope.

01:14:17.038 --> 01:14:18.484
TALIESIN: 12.

01:14:18.484 --> 01:14:25.094
LAURA: One! I'm not very observant today, okay?
I've got things on my mind.

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:34.807
MATT: Okay. As you walk through and pore over the
ruins, the structure is fairly simple. This wasn't

01:14:34.807 --> 01:14:41.143
some beautifully-made stone hall. Most of the
stones here were probably pulled from rivers or

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:47.305
were smoothed over, and they're varying sizes, and
the masonry is very simple.

01:14:47.305 --> 01:14:50.062
TALIESIN: Couldn't figure what it's a temple to,
or any--?

01:14:50.062 --> 01:14:52.900
MATT: Not particularly. You don't know if it's a
temple; it could have been an abode. It doesn't

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:58.766
appear to be huge. There seem to be one or two
adjacent rooms that were set in that space.

01:14:58.766 --> 01:15:02.955
TALIESIN: And nothing from the Detect Undead?

01:15:02.955 --> 01:15:04.956
MATT: Nothing from the Detect Undead, no.

01:15:04.956 --> 01:15:06.921
TALIESIN: Other than what I already expect to
see?

01:15:06.921 --> 01:15:08.215
MATT: No.

01:15:08.215 --> 01:15:12.345
TALIESIN: What I expect to see is still giving off
a little glow, right?

01:15:12.345 --> 01:15:16.245
MATT: Correct. What's the range on that?

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:24.818
TALIESIN: 60 feet, although I will say divination
magic would also blind me to that, and if it was

01:15:24.818 --> 01:15:28.463
full cover, I would possibly not see it as well.

01:15:28.463 --> 01:15:32.482
MATT: Right, understood. Caduceus, what's your
armor class?

01:15:32.482 --> 01:15:34.958
TALIESIN: 17.

01:15:34.958 --> 01:15:40.890
MATT: As you're looking over the stonework and
turning to Jester to mention you didn't see much--

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:43.218
TALIESIN: The funny thing is--

01:15:43.218 --> 01:15:51.861
MATT: (impact) There is a shape that moves out of
the shadows with incredible speed. The light, the

01:15:51.861 --> 01:15:57.705
faint color being emanated from Caduceus' cantrip
immediately falls away and you see the streak of

01:15:57.705 --> 01:16:02.999
his hair disappear in the nearby shadow. I need
you to make a strength saving throw.

01:16:02.999 --> 01:16:05.102
LAURA: Like he's gone? He's just gone in front of
me?

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:07.991
MATT: You watched him be pushed off into a nearby
bush.

01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:12.503
MARISHA: Football tackled, just gone, okay.

01:16:12.503 --> 01:16:14.312
TALIESIN: Ten.

01:16:14.312 --> 01:16:21.572
MATT: That's a fail. You get pushed off, land on
the ground, you tumble, and are held prone on the

01:16:21.572 --> 01:16:28.331
ground as what little bit of light you can see--
not having darkvision, unfortunately-- what you

01:16:28.331 --> 01:16:38.223
see is a faint glimmer of two large white fangs, a
smattering of whiskers right before you, this

01:16:38.223 --> 01:16:45.966
growl sound, and a cluster of snake heads that
bend around each side of the head.

01:16:45.966 --> 01:16:48.969
TRAVIS: I just peed a little.

01:16:48.969 --> 01:17:01.835
MATT: The bite attack hits you. That is only five
points of piercing damage. Actually, it gets

01:17:01.835 --> 01:17:04.870
advantage on the second one. Okay, with the
advantage it does hit, and the other one, the

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:12.188
snakes all snap onto you, multiple snake bites,
all biting across your face and your throat. For

01:17:12.188 --> 01:17:16.929
that, you suffer eight points of piercing damage
and you need to make a constitution saving throw, please.

01:17:16.929 --> 01:17:22.939
SAM: Mr. Clay.

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:24.987
TALIESIN: I mean, come on.

01:17:24.987 --> 01:17:26.105
MATT: Ooh.

01:17:26.105 --> 01:17:30.318
LAURA: Oh no, don't make that sound, Matthew.

01:17:30.318 --> 01:17:33.304
TALIESIN: And I need to make a constitution saving
throw?

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:35.077
SAM: You've got this, Mr. Clay.

01:17:35.077 --> 01:17:36.694
TRAVIS: Come on, snitch!

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:38.511
TALIESIN: 15.

01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:42.471
MATT: That's a success. You take half damage. You
only take 12 points of poison damage.

01:17:42.471 --> 01:17:44.671
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

01:17:44.671 --> 01:17:46.580
LAURA: But he's not poisoned?

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:52.444
MATT: Correct. Jester, you see the shape and you
glance over and you can see with your darkvision

01:17:52.444 --> 01:18:00.192
this ten-foot-long leopard-like cat that is
currently now pressed onto the chest and body of

01:18:00.192 --> 01:18:06.532
Caduceus. It bites down towards him and all these
strange protrusions from around the shoulders and

01:18:06.532 --> 01:18:11.073
head area all strike down, as a few of them curl
back and look at you and in that bit, you can see

01:18:11.073 --> 01:18:18.358
a few beats of light, faint bits of starlight and
moon that are coming down and reflecting in the

01:18:18.358 --> 01:18:26.192
eyes of these snake heads. And you hear this
(growling) up behind you on the ruin where you

01:18:26.192 --> 01:18:27.922
were just standing. I'll be right back.

01:18:27.922 --> 01:18:31.616
TRAVIS: We got ambushed!

01:18:31.616 --> 01:18:33.558
LAURA: What do we do?!

01:18:33.558 --> 01:18:34.775
SAM: Clever girl.

01:18:34.775 --> 01:18:37.125
LAURA: Oh no!

01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:40.222
TRAVIS: How far away are you guys?

01:18:40.222 --> 01:18:43.375
LAURA: I don't know if we're very far. I don't
think we're very far away.

01:18:43.375 --> 01:18:46.155
LIAM: They went to do a perimeter sweep.

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:48.868
SAM: Find out about these beasts on D&amp;amp;D Beyond!

01:18:48.868 --> 01:18:54.562
TRAVIS: Oh shit! That means there's probably more
than two?

01:18:54.562 --> 01:18:56.962
SAM: Look at these palm trees!

01:18:56.962 --> 01:18:58.295
LAURA: This is really cool, though.

01:18:58.295 --> 01:19:01.965
MATT: Caduceus, you are over here. Jester, you are
here.

01:19:05.902 --> 01:19:09.128
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:19:10.854 --> 01:19:15.998
MATT: Now the rest of you are over-- so Jamedi's
over here in his tent. The rest of you are all

01:19:15.998 --> 01:19:27.976
clustered inside the hut. Caduceus--

01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:32.418
LAURA: Oh god, it's so scary! It's a leopard with
snake heads!

01:19:32.418 --> 01:19:35.289
MARISHA: It's a leopard with snakes!

01:19:35.289 --> 01:19:37.627
TRAVIS: Why would you make that?

01:19:37.627 --> 01:19:43.935
SAM: That's someone who was drunk at night and was
like, "Let's just do this thing!"

01:19:43.935 --> 01:19:52.232
MATT: I need everyone to roll initiative.
Technically you guys don't hear anything, so we'll

01:19:52.232 --> 01:19:54.117
see when it comes around your turn.

01:19:54.117 --> 01:19:57.934
MARISHA: Wait, what? What do you mean, we don't
hear anything? You said we heard through the bubble!

01:19:57.934 --> 01:20:04.783
MATT: You hear sounds, but there's been no sound
yet. You guys have been setting yourselves up for

01:20:04.783 --> 01:20:08.609
the evening there. The only person that would have
probably noticed would have been Caduceus.

01:20:08.609 --> 01:20:11.525
TRAVIS: And he is getting fucked up right now.

01:20:11.525 --> 01:20:15.154
LIAM: The good news is we're totally safe in this
bubble and nothing can happen to us.

01:20:15.154 --> 01:20:16.603
SAM: And both of our clerics--

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:20.551
TRAVIS: Both our healers are outside! Typical.

01:20:20.551 --> 01:20:22.464
MATT: 25 to 20.

01:20:22.464 --> 01:20:23.776
MARISHA: Wow. Cool.

01:20:23.776 --> 01:20:24.960
TRAVIS: Nobody.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.795
SAM: Oh, someone roll for Yasha.

01:20:26.795 --> 01:20:29.180
MATT: If you want to get that?

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:32.945
TRAVIS: Seven, plus-- I got to get her sheet.

01:20:32.945 --> 01:20:34.652
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:20:34.652 --> 01:20:35.779
TRAVIS: I think it's nine.

01:20:35.779 --> 01:20:38.315
LAURA: I need a Turkish delight before I die.

01:20:38.315 --> 01:20:41.984
MATT: 25 to 20. Nobody? 20 to 15?

01:20:41.984 --> 01:20:42.967
MARISHA: 18.

01:20:42.967 --> 01:20:44.501
TALIESIN: 17.

01:20:44.501 --> 01:20:46.538
TRAVIS: Beau, Caduceus.

01:20:46.538 --> 01:20:49.773
LAURA: No! Stop! Look at all the powder falling
off.

01:20:49.773 --> 01:20:52.485
SAM: We're going to eat that whole box.

01:20:52.485 --> 01:20:54.237
MATT: 15 to ten.

01:20:54.237 --> 01:20:56.299
LAURA: 13.

01:21:04.829 --> 01:21:06.750
MATT: All righty. Ten to five.

01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:08.543
TRAVIS: Yasha has nine. I have eight.

01:21:08.543 --> 01:21:14.657
SAM: Nott's sitting at seven. Oh, I'm at eight,
actually. Eight.

01:21:14.657 --> 01:21:18.382
MATT: Fjord and Nott got the same. All right,
Caleb.

01:21:18.382 --> 01:21:19.334
LIAM: Vier.

01:21:19.334 --> 01:21:20.895
TRAVIS: What?

01:21:20.895 --> 01:21:22.895
LIAM: Four.

01:21:22.895 --> 01:21:26.886
SAM: Eins, zwei, drei, vier.

01:21:26.886 --> 01:21:30.954
MATT: Beau, you're up first, but you have not
noticed anything, so your turn is spent fluffing

01:21:30.954 --> 01:21:33.074
your space to sleep for the evening.

01:21:33.074 --> 01:21:37.978
MARISHA: You know what, Fjord? I think Jester is a
little jealous. Just throwing it out there.

01:21:37.978 --> 01:21:39.369
TRAVIS: Jealous? Jealous of what?

01:21:39.369 --> 01:21:41.150
MARISHA: Shit, are you fucking serious right now?

01:21:41.150 --> 01:21:42.145
LIAM: Six seconds. Done.

01:21:42.145 --> 01:21:43.569
MATT: Caduceus.

01:21:43.569 --> 01:21:49.535
TALIESIN: I'm going to yell for help and then I'm
going to--

01:21:49.535 --> 01:21:51.843
MATT: You all immediately hear--

01:21:51.843 --> 01:22:01.095
TALIESIN: Help! Then I'm going to tap my staff to
wake up my beetles as my bonus action. My beetles

01:22:01.095 --> 01:22:09.320
are going to make a bite attack on that. I
actually have that information now thanks to the update.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.144
SAM: On D&amp;amp;D Beyond?

01:22:11.144 --> 01:22:12.117
TALIESIN: On D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

01:22:12.117 --> 01:22:13.017
SAM: Wow.

01:22:13.017 --> 01:22:23.661
TALIESIN: So that's a swarm attack, they have a
bite. That's plus three to hit, I believe. That's a 13.

01:22:23.661 --> 01:22:25.198
MATT: 13 does not hit.

01:22:25.198 --> 01:22:29.321
TALIESIN: Okay. That's okay. Well, they're in the
space right now. I'm panicking, so this is going

01:22:29.321 --> 01:22:35.375
to be fun. I'm going to start making a weird,
awful sound, and I'm going to start getting even

01:22:35.375 --> 01:22:40.675
paler and a little gaunter, and I'm going to grab
it and I'm going to cast-- I'm so panicked--

01:22:40.675 --> 01:22:43.062
Vampiric Touch.

01:22:43.062 --> 01:22:46.867
TRAVIS: I like it! Get some of that shit back.

01:22:46.867 --> 01:22:49.126
TALIESIN: So since I'm in contact with it--

01:22:49.126 --> 01:22:50.076
MATT: It's a melee spell attack.

01:22:50.076 --> 01:22:51.231
TALIESIN: Melee spell attack.

01:22:51.231 --> 01:22:53.866
MATT: Go ahead and roll for an attack.

01:22:56.578 --> 01:23:01.683
TALIESIN: What is a melee attack here?

01:23:01.683 --> 01:23:04.522
MATT: It's a d20 plus your spell attack modifier.

01:23:04.522 --> 01:23:08.987
TALIESIN: Okay, plus eight. 20.

01:23:08.987 --> 01:23:11.455
MATT: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll damage for the
Vampiric Touch.

01:23:11.455 --> 01:23:16.867
TALIESIN: Oh man, this is mean.

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:19.497
MATT: They're next and then Jester, you're up.

01:23:19.497 --> 01:23:20.728
LAURA: Okay.

01:23:20.728 --> 01:23:36.230
TALIESIN: That's 3d6. That's (counting) ten points
of necrotic damage and I regain five hit points.

01:23:36.230 --> 01:23:38.791
TRAVIS: Atta boy!

01:23:41.083 --> 01:23:46.877
MATT: As you reach up, your hand grasps its throat
and this strange hissing sound happens as you pull

01:23:46.877 --> 01:23:52.083
life force energy out of it. It's strange threads
of purplish-black energy that pull into your body,

01:23:52.083 --> 01:23:54.128
your wounds healing up slightly.

01:23:54.128 --> 01:23:55.282
LAURA: So I can see that, huh?

01:23:55.282 --> 01:23:57.386
MATT: You can see a faint bit of energy coming out
of Caduceus.

01:23:57.386 --> 01:23:59.941
TALIESIN: Help!

01:23:59.941 --> 01:24:02.968
MATT: Is that your turn?

01:24:02.968 --> 01:24:06.454
TALIESIN: That is, unless I can try and move
away.

01:24:06.454 --> 01:24:09.850
MATT: You're prone, so it's half movement to try
and crawl away. Or you can spend half your

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:12.990
movement to get up and then you still have half
your movement to try and escape if you want.

01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:14.928
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and half my movement to
get up.

01:24:14.928 --> 01:24:17.107
MATT: All righty. So you get up from prone.

01:24:17.107 --> 01:24:20.214
LAURA: Well, that's good. I thought he was like on
top of you.

01:24:20.214 --> 01:24:23.169
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up against you.

01:24:23.852 --> 01:24:25.374
MATT: To here.

01:24:25.374 --> 01:24:26.818
LAURA: Won't he get an attack of opportunity?

01:24:26.818 --> 01:24:28.217
TALIESIN: Will he get an attack of opportunity?

01:24:28.217 --> 01:24:29.734
MATT: You can go right there and not get an attack
of opportunity.

01:24:29.734 --> 01:24:34.140
TALIESIN: Okay, perfect. That way if you get
poisoned, I can un-poison you.

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:37.124
LAURA: If you get poisoned, I can un-poison you!

01:24:37.124 --> 01:24:38.180
TALIESIN: Cool.

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:42.435
MATT: That finishes Caduceus' turn. It's now their
turn. The one up top who's hissing down at you,

01:24:42.435 --> 01:24:54.379
(long exhale). As its jaw opens, this
semi-translucent rolling cloud of dust and gas

01:24:54.379 --> 01:25:00.159
emanates in a 30-foot-cone.

01:25:00.159 --> 01:25:03.839
LAURA and MARISHA: (intone "Semi-Charmed Life")

01:25:03.839 --> 01:25:06.217
TALIESIN: Both clerics. Why did both clerics go on
a hunting mission?

01:25:06.217 --> 01:25:07.557
LAURA: We're the stupidest.

01:25:07.557 --> 01:25:08.898
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're so dumb.

01:25:08.898 --> 01:25:11.106
MATT: I need you both to make constitution saving
throws, please.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:14.434
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:17.148
SAM: Picking your dice.

01:25:17.148 --> 01:25:20.571
TRAVIS: It's like Avatar in the fucking--

01:25:20.571 --> 01:25:22.235
TALIESIN: 20.

01:25:22.235 --> 01:25:23.652
MATT: 20. You manage to resist the effect.

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:25.747
LAURA: Nine.

01:25:25.747 --> 01:25:31.969
MATT: Jester, you inhale it, suddenly caught
off-guard by it and your eyes blink and go dark as

01:25:31.969 --> 01:25:33.183
you fall unconscious.

01:25:33.183 --> 01:25:34.402
LAURA: So sleepy.

01:25:34.402 --> 01:25:35.637
MARISHA: She's unconscious?!

01:25:35.637 --> 01:25:36.607
MATT: Yep.

01:25:36.607 --> 01:25:38.131
SAM: Wait, like unconscious or asleep?

01:25:38.131 --> 01:25:43.877
MATT: Like unconscious. Not zero hit points, but
asleep unconscious.

01:25:43.877 --> 01:25:45.250
LAURA: Like hardcore.

01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:47.675
MATT: Yes. All right.

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:49.721
TRAVIS: Shit.

01:25:49.721 --> 01:25:57.994
MATT: It is going to move, jump down from here,
and begin to move this way to flank you, Caduceus.

01:25:57.994 --> 01:26:18.865
Now flanking you, is going to attempt to strike at
you twice. Good to know, I forgot about that.

01:26:18.865 --> 01:26:23.676
Bite, this one's claws, so it's going to be with
advantage. Okay, that is going to make it an 18 to hit.

01:26:23.676 --> 01:26:25.167
TALIESIN: Why is it advantage?

01:26:25.167 --> 01:26:26.124
MATT: Because they're flanking you.

01:26:26.124 --> 01:26:27.919
TALIESIN: Oh, goddamn it. Yeah, that hits.

01:26:27.919 --> 01:26:33.345
MATT: All right, so the bite attack. You take six
points of piercing damage and the snakes snap at

01:26:33.345 --> 01:26:37.394
you. That is going to be a 19.

01:26:37.394 --> 01:26:39.073
TALIESIN: That also hits.

01:26:39.073 --> 01:26:44.847
MATT: You take another-- ooh, that's ten points of
piercing damage. At this point, as you're between

01:26:44.847 --> 01:26:50.726
the two of them, the one behind you that just put
Jester to sleep, all its snakes snap around you,

01:26:50.726 --> 01:26:54.399
the back of your head and your neck and your
shoulders, and you feel the poison through your

01:26:54.399 --> 01:26:56.639
veins. Roll another constitution saving throw,
please.

01:26:56.737 --> 01:26:58.736
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:27:00.251 --> 01:27:02.762
MATT: Two of the clerics went out on a solo
mission.

01:27:04.835 --> 01:27:06.680
TALIESIN: 12.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.925
MATT: 12? 12 just-- no, 12 succeeds!

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:13.068
LAURA: Yay!

01:27:13.068 --> 01:27:16.733
TALIESIN: How do you have that spray and the
snakes in the same-- that's just so much.

01:27:16.733 --> 01:27:18.044
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you--

01:27:18.044 --> 01:27:20.837
TALIESIN: Help! I'm standing.

01:27:20.837 --> 01:27:24.454
MATT: Half that is going to be 13 points of poison
damage.

01:27:24.454 --> 01:27:26.719
TALIESIN: I'm kind of still standing.

01:27:26.719 --> 01:27:28.401
LAURA: He's like slumped.

01:27:28.401 --> 01:27:36.362
MATT: All righty, they're done. Jester, you are
unconscious and sleeping.

01:27:36.474 --> 01:27:38.335
LAURA: I'm going to dream about the Traveler.

01:27:38.335 --> 01:27:41.583
MATT: That brings us to Avantika and Jamedi.

01:27:41.583 --> 01:27:46.935
LAURA: I'm dreaming that me and the Traveler are
skipping over hills and picking flowers.

01:27:46.935 --> 01:27:50.252
MATT: "What the shit is that?" pulls out the
rapier and the dagger, and darts, leaping over

01:27:50.252 --> 01:27:57.394
(counting), just seeing these creatures rushes
forward. "Hiyah!" and is leaping forward with her

01:27:57.394 --> 01:28:03.922
rapier and blade and is going to make three
attacks. The gray is going to be with the dagger,

01:28:03.922 --> 01:28:12.023
one rapier shot misses, then one for the rapier
and one for the dagger hits. For the dagger, that is--

01:28:12.023 --> 01:28:15.185
MARISHA: Going for a nighttime stroll.

01:28:15.428 --> 01:28:18.256
TRAVIS: We are in a total danger zone,
and we're taking strolls.

01:28:18.256 --> 01:28:20.904
MARISHA: (singing) Danger zone!

01:28:21.428 --> 01:28:25.054
TALIESIN: It was my own fault. I was suspicious.

01:28:25.054 --> 01:28:26.648
MATT: And another ten points of damage on that.

01:28:26.648 --> 01:28:28.282
TRAVIS: What? On both? Wow.

01:28:28.282 --> 01:28:35.055
MATT: It was a seven and a ten. Then Avantika
seems to be holding both blades ready, preparing

01:28:35.055 --> 01:28:42.327
to defend herself. Jamedi, who stumbles out of his
tent, is only half movement, glances over and can

01:28:42.327 --> 01:28:49.428
barely see what's there. He's on the inside of the
dome, pulls out his shortbow, and is going to

01:28:49.428 --> 01:28:57.103
attempt to shoot it with an arrow and misses with
a four. A natural four. There is no light source

01:28:57.103 --> 01:29:02.670
here; it seems to disappear in the distance. That
finishes with his turn. That brings us to Yasha.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:08.247
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha will use her full movement to
follow Avantika out of the bubble. The Bublé.

01:29:08.247 --> 01:29:11.697
LAURA: Can she flank it?

01:29:11.697 --> 01:29:13.488
MATT: She can get to about there.

01:29:13.488 --> 01:29:14.626
TRAVIS: Is that within melee?

01:29:14.626 --> 01:29:15.648
MATT: That is within melee, yes.

01:29:15.648 --> 01:29:19.836
TRAVIS: Great. She'll take a swipe. That is a 17.

01:29:19.836 --> 01:29:22.346
MATT: 17 will hit!

01:29:22.346 --> 01:29:23.635
TRAVIS: So that's 2d6 right?

01:29:23.635 --> 01:29:25.413
MATT: 2d6 plus an additional d6.

01:29:25.413 --> 01:29:26.832
LAURA: Did she rage?

01:29:26.832 --> 01:29:30.487
TRAVIS: No, she didn't. Because I-- yep.

01:29:30.487 --> 01:29:32.034
LIAM: He doesn't know barbarians.

01:29:32.034 --> 01:29:34.037
MATT: So no, it's just 2d6 because you weren't
raging.

01:29:34.037 --> 01:29:36.126
TRAVIS: Great, six points of damage.

01:29:36.126 --> 01:29:38.364
MATT: All right. You added the three points for
strength, right?

01:29:38.364 --> 01:29:41.319
TRAVIS: No! Nine points of damage.

01:29:41.319 --> 01:29:45.055
MATT: Nine point of damage. You got it. Second
attack?

01:29:45.055 --> 01:29:48.233
MARISHA: It's real fun playing a character when
you don't have their sheet.

01:29:48.233 --> 01:29:51.177
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's 16.

01:29:51.177 --> 01:29:58.144
MATT: 16? That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 2d6
plus three. Plus four technically because--

01:29:58.144 --> 01:30:01.618
TRAVIS: Oh, plus four? So six, so ten. Ten points
of damage.

01:30:01.618 --> 01:30:03.129
MATT: Got it.

01:30:03.129 --> 01:30:05.412
TRAVIS: And with her bonus action, she would like
to rage.

01:30:05.412 --> 01:30:06.613
SAM: Hey!

01:30:06.613 --> 01:30:13.995
MATT: There you go! That finishes up Yasha's turn.
Fjord and Nott, you guys up.

01:30:13.995 --> 01:30:24.321
SAM: I heard Mr. Clay. Let's go. I'll scramble
out, going into the direction that I heard the

01:30:24.321 --> 01:30:27.686
sound and seeing all these folks over here.

01:30:27.686 --> 01:30:30.035
MATT: Okay, so you leave the thing, you can see
everyone right there.

01:30:30.035 --> 01:30:31.459
SAM: Do I see the beast?

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:33.053
MATT: You do. You see that one beast right there.

01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:41.038
SAM: I will kneel down and pew, shoot it in its
hindquarters. That's a miss. 12.

01:30:41.038 --> 01:30:42.832
MATT: 12 does not hit.

01:30:42.832 --> 01:30:53.627
SAM: Reload. Fire again. Wait, do I want to do
this? Nope. I'll keep moving and hide behind that wall.

01:30:53.627 --> 01:30:54.480
MATT: Right here?

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.244
SAM: Yeah.

01:30:55.244 --> 01:30:55.967
MATT: All righty.

01:30:55.967 --> 01:30:56.877
SAM: Bonus action hide.

01:30:56.877 --> 01:30:59.115
MATT: Role a stealth check.

01:30:59.450 --> 01:31:00.929
SAM: Okay, that's a 28.

01:31:00.929 --> 01:31:03.113
LAURA: Don't you get advantage because of your
cloak?

01:31:03.113 --> 01:31:04.521
SAM: Sure.

01:31:04.521 --> 01:31:05.647
LAURA: You could get a 20.

01:31:05.647 --> 01:31:06.719
SAM: Still 28.

01:31:06.719 --> 01:31:08.940
MATT: You are stealthed there. Okay, so that
finishes Nott's go. Fjord, what are you doing?

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:15.186
TRAVIS: Can I use my 30 feet of movement to run
that direction around the far side of the ruin? Yep.

01:31:15.186 --> 01:31:18.842
MATT: You come around the edge and you turn and
see, right there in front of you, another one of

01:31:18.842 --> 01:31:21.644
these leopard-like creatures, and you're like, "Oh
shit!" You didn't even notice there was a second

01:31:21.644 --> 01:31:22.487
one there.

01:31:22.487 --> 01:31:25.930
TRAVIS: Oh shit! I'll just fire both streams of
Eldritch Blast from each hand.

01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:27.708
MATT: Go for it!

01:31:28.806 --> 01:31:30.667
TRAVIS: 13.

01:31:30.667 --> 01:31:32.880
MATT: 13 misses, unfortunately.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.315
TRAVIS: Second one. That'll hit. 23.

01:31:35.315 --> 01:31:36.403
MATT: That'll work.

01:31:36.403 --> 01:31:43.157
TRAVIS: Excellent. Nice. That's 11 points of
Eldritch Blast.

01:31:43.157 --> 01:31:47.568
MATT: You blast and almost force it off of its
feet for a second. It catches itself (growling).

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:49.354
TRAVIS: Nice. Great, that's it.

01:31:49.354 --> 01:31:53.617
MATT: (hissing) All the snakes turn to look at you
for a second. That finishes Fjord's go. Caleb,

01:31:53.617 --> 01:31:54.931
you're up.

01:31:54.931 --> 01:31:57.147
LIAM: I drop the hut, it's gone.

01:31:57.147 --> 01:31:58.814
MATT: It vanishes.

01:31:58.814 --> 01:32:03.815
LIAM: Seeing what I see, I've got the transmuter
stone, I can see in dim light, so I'm feeling into

01:32:03.815 --> 01:32:13.407
my satchel and I take out some molasses and smear
it on my hands and cast Slow on-- I'll come as far

01:32:13.407 --> 01:32:17.115
as I can over here, behind Yasha, to see what I
can see.

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:18.214
MATT: Over here you mean?

01:32:18.214 --> 01:32:23.775
LIAM: I will come this way, not getting closer to
them. Yeah, that's fine. That's good. And cast

01:32:23.775 --> 01:32:26.158
Slow on the two creatures that I see.

01:32:26.158 --> 01:32:28.695
MATT: All righty.

01:32:28.695 --> 01:32:31.385
LIAM: DC 16.

01:32:31.385 --> 01:32:34.597
MATT: Yeah, all right, DC 16. That is a wisdom?

01:32:34.597 --> 01:32:35.988
LIAM: Yeah.

01:32:35.988 --> 01:32:43.832
MATT: All right, that is a success. 16 on the
first roll. That's that one there. The other one,

01:32:43.832 --> 01:32:46.701
natural 17 plus two, they both succeed, I'm so
sorry.

01:32:46.701 --> 01:32:48.640
LIAM: No, no apologies.

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.718
TRAVIS: Good rolls.

01:32:50.718 --> 01:32:53.663
MATT: Those were good rolls on their part. Does
that finish your turn, Caleb?

01:32:53.663 --> 01:32:56.781
LIAM: If I have any movement left, I will back
away from that shit.

01:32:56.781 --> 01:33:05.660
MATT: You have maybe five feet, I'll say right
here. So you start backing away. Back at the top

01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:08.516
of the round. Beau, you're up. The orb has
vanished, everyone has rushed out, you look over

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:12.226
and you can hear these growls, and snarls, and
impacts. Combat is happening. What are you doing?

01:33:12.226 --> 01:33:20.887
MARISHA: Oh my pillow-- ah! Then I just run and I
say: Nott! Duck! I jump over Nott and I'm going

01:33:20.887 --> 01:33:25.117
for this one in the back, 45-speed.

01:33:25.117 --> 01:33:26.328
MATT: Over this way, you mean?

01:33:26.328 --> 01:33:27.543
MARISHA: Yeah, that one in the back.

01:33:27.543 --> 01:33:29.350
TRAVIS: Oh, the one that I've been shooting at or
the closest--

01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:30.767
MARISHA: The one that Fjord's been shooting at.

01:33:30.767 --> 01:33:35.837
MATT: All right. First off, roll an acrobatics
check to make it over the wall.

01:33:35.837 --> 01:33:37.695
MARISHA: Yeah, 25.

01:33:37.695 --> 01:33:43.626
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. (counting)

01:33:43.626 --> 01:33:48.450
MARISHA: I'm going to come down, big Iron Man
three-point landing, punch to its face.

01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:50.485
MATT: Go for it.

01:33:51.544 --> 01:33:55.343
MARISHA: Wow. Cool. Cool story, bro. 12?

01:33:55.343 --> 01:33:57.437
MATT: 12 misses, unfortunately.

01:33:57.437 --> 01:34:03.992
MARISHA: I crack my knuckles on a rock and I'm
like: Ah! And I roundhouse kick it with my second attack.

01:34:03.992 --> 01:34:05.383
MATT: Go for it.

01:34:05.383 --> 01:34:07.739
MARISHA: That's better. That's a 22.

01:34:07.739 --> 01:34:11.407
MATT: 22 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:34:11.407 --> 01:34:16.501
MARISHA: Wow, that's super great. Five points.

01:34:16.501 --> 01:34:18.581
MATT: Five points of damage with your second
strike.

01:34:18.581 --> 01:34:25.086
MARISHA: Then I'm going to go ahead and-- I hit
it, so I can do stunning-- no, I need to hit it

01:34:25.191 --> 01:34:27.218
twice for stunning strike, right?

01:34:27.218 --> 01:34:28.410
MATT: No, you just need to hit it once.

01:34:28.410 --> 01:34:29.626
MARISHA: Just once? Can I stun it?

01:34:29.626 --> 01:34:36.330
MATT: Yeah, all right, constitution saving throw.
That is a natural one. So you miss the first

01:34:36.330 --> 01:34:41.090
strike, but as you roundhouse kick, you manage to
kick right up in its abdomen. You feel ribs break

01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:46.416
and buckle under the impact of the kick. Some sort
of chain reaction spirals across its nervous

01:34:46.416 --> 01:34:52.313
system as it falls to its side. It is stunned
until the end of your next turn.

01:34:52.313 --> 01:34:56.291
MARISHA: I'm going to spend another ki point and
do flurry of blows for my bonus action.

01:34:56.291 --> 01:34:58.442
MATT: Yes, you can do that. Yes.

01:34:58.442 --> 01:35:02.129
MARISHA: And do pop pop, two more punches.

01:35:02.129 --> 01:35:04.682
MATT: Go for it. You have advantage on these, I
believe. Yep.

01:35:04.682 --> 01:35:15.897
MARISHA: First attack. I'll take that natural 17,
which I'm pretty sure hits for nine damage, and

01:35:15.897 --> 01:35:26.706
then second attack is a natural 20. Thank you,
Gil. Roll two dice. That's double sixes! That's 12

01:35:26.706 --> 01:35:34.794
plus four. No, wait. I double my die roll. I only
roll once.

01:35:34.794 --> 01:35:37.974
MATT: It would have been fine. It's the same
either way. So 16 points of damage.

01:35:37.974 --> 01:35:43.122
MARISHA: Sorry, 16 points of damage plus four, so
20 points of damage. Wait. No, 16 points of

01:35:43.122 --> 01:35:45.945
damage. Math!

01:35:45.945 --> 01:35:50.771
MATT: After it's stunned, you get up and wail on
him. The second hit managing to plunge right

01:35:50.771 --> 01:35:56.605
towards where its kidney is, and you don't feel
any sort of muscular resistance as your fist sinks

01:35:56.605 --> 01:36:00.780
about an inch or two into its body. You pull back.
It doesn't break the skin, but you can feel you

01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:06.106
hurt some meaty organs in the inside. Does that
finish your turn, Beau?

01:36:06.106 --> 01:36:06.938
MARISHA: Yes.

01:36:06.938 --> 01:36:08.906
MATT: All right. Caduceus.

01:36:08.906 --> 01:36:12.474
TALIESIN: So there's a stunned one behind me? A
stunned one on one side of me and a not-stunned

01:36:12.474 --> 01:36:13.516
one on the other.

01:36:13.516 --> 01:36:15.193
MATT: Correct.

01:36:15.193 --> 01:36:17.046
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit the stunned one with
the Vampiric Touch.

01:36:17.046 --> 01:36:19.381
MATT: Go for it. You have advantage on it.

01:36:19.381 --> 01:36:20.948
SAM: You're at one hit point!

01:36:20.948 --> 01:36:23.170
TALIESIN: I'm at four.

01:36:23.170 --> 01:36:26.317
LAURA: He's getting Vampiric Touch. That means
he'll get to heal a little bit.

01:36:26.317 --> 01:36:31.066
TALIESIN: It lasts. That's 17?

01:36:31.066 --> 01:36:33.833
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Roll damage.

01:36:33.833 --> 01:36:42.151
TALIESIN: That was close. Seven points of damage.
So I get three back?

01:36:42.151 --> 01:36:43.433
MATT: You heal three back.

01:36:43.433 --> 01:36:53.196
TALIESIN: So now I am at seven hit points. Now I'm
going to vanish. I'm going to disappear.

01:36:53.196 --> 01:36:55.680
MATT: Okay. You turn invisible.

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.066
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn invisible.

01:36:57.066 --> 01:36:58.676
MATT: Until the end of your next turn.

01:36:58.676 --> 01:37:08.634
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm going to circle around and
back off. Yeah. Then take a couple steps back. See

01:37:08.634 --> 01:37:10.005
if anything happens.

01:37:10.005 --> 01:37:16.210
MATT: It hears you moving and swipes out. It has
disadvantage on the strike. The snakes swing out

01:37:16.210 --> 01:37:18.917
towards you. That is a 14 to hit.

01:37:18.917 --> 01:37:20.477
TALIESIN: That misses.

01:37:20.477 --> 01:37:24.327
MATT: You dodge out of the way. The snakes all
snap out in the middle of the air.

01:37:24.327 --> 01:37:32.141
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a little further out.
I'm not going to go off the board or anything.

01:37:32.141 --> 01:37:33.988
That's fine.

01:37:33.988 --> 01:37:39.854
MATT: Okay. That ends your go. It's now their
turn.

01:37:39.854 --> 01:37:43.013
SAM: You're going to be fine, Jessie.

01:37:43.013 --> 01:37:44.765
LAURA: Yeah. Totally.

01:37:44.765 --> 01:37:47.427
SAM: You're asleep.

01:37:47.427 --> 01:37:54.137
MATT: The other one that currently, seeing all the
individuals cluster in the area, begins to back

01:37:54.137 --> 01:38:02.888
up, and its torso swells and its lower jaw opens
and (exhales). The other one now releases a

01:38:02.888 --> 01:38:14.748
similar burbling cloud right there. Avantika's
going to have to make a constitution saving throw.

01:38:14.748 --> 01:38:17.769
Fails. Avantika falls asleep.

01:38:17.769 --> 01:38:19.498
SAM: Is this a spray or a cloud?

01:38:19.498 --> 01:38:20.445
MATT: It's a cloud.

01:38:20.445 --> 01:38:21.937
SAM: So it goes around walls.

01:38:21.937 --> 01:38:23.798
MATT: Yep. I need you to make a constitution save,
Nott.

01:38:23.798 --> 01:38:24.468
TRAVIS: Me too, right?

01:38:24.468 --> 01:38:25.954
MARISHA: Was I in that? Or no?

01:38:25.954 --> 01:38:26.885
TRAVIS: 21.

01:38:26.885 --> 01:38:29.656
MATT: You're fine. Make it.

01:38:29.656 --> 01:38:32.258
MARISHA: 13.

01:38:32.258 --> 01:38:34.264
MATT: You succeed.

01:38:34.264 --> 01:38:35.559
SAM: 17.

01:38:35.559 --> 01:38:37.677
MATT: You succeed.

01:38:37.677 --> 01:38:42.329
LAURA: How about Yasha? Did Yasha roll?

01:38:42.329 --> 01:38:47.980
MATT: Yasha was just out of the range of it,
actually. With that, it's going to attempt to run

01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:51.953
off this way and dart. Yasha gets one strike on
it.

01:38:51.953 --> 01:38:54.804
TRAVIS: She'll make it reckless.

01:38:54.804 --> 01:38:56.574
MATT: Can't, reckless is on your turn.

01:38:56.574 --> 01:38:59.833
TRAVIS: That's right. Yeah! That's a 24.

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:01.436
MATT: That'll hit.

01:39:01.436 --> 01:39:08.596
TRAVIS: She's raging so 3d6. Nice! 14.

01:39:08.697 --> 01:39:19.087
MATT: As she strikes wide with the blade, the
creature (snarling). It's limping a little bit and

01:39:19.087 --> 01:39:23.417
it's trying to back away. It's unable to move from
where it is. Its speed is reduced to zero. So it

01:39:23.417 --> 01:39:29.774
turns to now look at the two unconscious figures
on the ground. That one is stunned so it can't do

01:39:29.774 --> 01:39:33.353
anything. Jester, you're up. You're asleep.

01:39:33.353 --> 01:39:36.311
LAURA: I dream--

01:39:36.311 --> 01:39:41.488
MATT: Avantika can't do anything. She's asleep.
Jamedi is going to move here next to the trees for

01:39:41.488 --> 01:39:47.102
cover. He's going to reload his shortbow and take
a shot at that-- natural 20!

01:39:47.102 --> 01:39:49.407
TRAVIS: Oh! Get it, Jamedi!

01:39:49.407 --> 01:39:52.664
MATT: All right. That's eight damage with the
shortbow.

01:39:52.664 --> 01:39:53.942
LIAM: Palms are sweaty.

01:39:53.942 --> 01:39:55.159
TRAVIS: Knees weak.

01:39:55.159 --> 01:39:57.332
MARISHA: Mom's Jamedi.

01:39:57.332 --> 01:40:03.045
(laughter)

01:40:03.045 --> 01:40:10.655
MATT: (clapping) Well done. That's fantastic.
That's going to end his turn. That brings us to Yasha.

01:40:10.655 --> 01:40:13.897
LIAM: You just roll your eyes at us at this point.
That made me so happy.

01:40:13.897 --> 01:40:16.690
MATT: No, "Mom's Jamedi" is pretty great.

01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:20.247
TRAVIS: She'll run up and take her two swipes,
reckless.

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:21.074
MATT: She going to move?

01:40:21.074 --> 01:40:22.995
TRAVIS: Yes. There you go.

01:40:22.995 --> 01:40:24.263
SAM: Reckless, Great Weapon Master.

01:40:24.263 --> 01:40:25.779
TRAVIS: Yeah! You know it.

01:40:25.779 --> 01:40:27.405
SAM: Is she that? I don't know.

01:40:27.405 --> 01:40:28.913
MATT: She's not Great Weapon Master, no.

01:40:28.913 --> 01:40:32.568
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20. Dope!

01:40:32.568 --> 01:40:35.728
MATT: Roll 3d6 and then double that.

01:40:35.728 --> 01:40:41.946
TRAVIS: That's seven, 14.

01:40:41.946 --> 01:40:49.317
MATT: 14 plus six, I believe. So 20 points of
damage. Yeah. How does Yasha want to do this?

01:40:49.317 --> 01:40:55.476
TRAVIS: She'll see it sit there, and she'll reach
up high, and she'll try and cleave off the front

01:40:55.476 --> 01:40:58.538
of the jaguar's head in one downward swing.

01:40:58.538 --> 01:41:02.031
MATT: The body attempts to leap and the head
stumbles underneath with some of the snake heads.

01:41:02.031 --> 01:41:07.673
The momentum carries it, but it runs straight into
the base of the tree, crossing the way before (impact)

01:41:07.673 --> 01:41:11.318
on the ground. The head, still (growling). Coming
to rest on the ground.

01:41:12.306 --> 01:41:17.807
TRAVIS: She still has one more attack, can she use
the rest of her movement to move towards the

01:41:17.807 --> 01:41:20.589
jaguar? I think she has ten feet of her movement.

01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:22.588
MATT: She could, yeah. If she has the rest of her
movement, she can use it to move up.

01:41:22.588 --> 01:41:23.612
TRAVIS: Is that melee or just outside of it?

01:41:23.612 --> 01:41:24.472
MATT: It's melee.

01:41:24.472 --> 01:41:29.113
TRAVIS: Oh great, reckless as well. 21.

01:41:29.113 --> 01:41:30.857
MATT: That hits.

01:41:30.857 --> 01:41:40.923
TRAVIS: Yeah! 14 points of damage. Plus three,
right? Or no?

01:41:40.923 --> 01:41:44.847
MATT: The 3d6 only happens on the first attack. So
it's only 2d6 for the second one.

01:41:44.847 --> 01:41:48.517
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you. Lets back it down to nine.

01:41:48.517 --> 01:41:59.482
MATT: Okay, got it. Plus six, so 14. Okay, got it.
That finishes Yasha's go. Fjord and Nott, you guys are up.

01:41:59.482 --> 01:42:12.458
SAM: I'll climb up over the wall and take a shot
at the one remaining leopard. A pew pew. 21!

01:42:12.458 --> 01:42:17.392
MATT: 21 hits! You have advantage on that shot
because it is stunned.

01:42:17.392 --> 01:42:23.334
SAM: Advantage! Well, that's a weird roll. I'm
going to do that again. It's still like 21.

01:42:23.334 --> 01:42:25.527
MATT: Yeah, so sneak attack on them.

01:42:25.527 --> 01:42:29.711
SAM: Yeah. Ugh, terrible.

01:42:29.711 --> 01:42:30.924
LAURA: Oh, I spit on you with that.

01:42:30.924 --> 01:42:33.110
SAM: That's okay. 15.

01:42:33.110 --> 01:42:39.472
MATT: 15 points of damage to it, struck. The blow
hits and sinks in. The creature's looking hurt,

01:42:39.472 --> 01:42:42.674
but it's still standing, though it is stunned.

01:42:42.674 --> 01:42:46.466
SAM: Damn. All right, I'll reload and shoot again,
this thing is--

01:42:46.466 --> 01:42:47.708
MATT: With advantage because it's still stunned.

01:42:47.708 --> 01:42:50.617
SAM: Great. 26.

01:42:50.617 --> 01:42:52.907
MATT: 26 will do, yeah.

01:42:52.907 --> 01:42:56.467
SAM: And then this is not a sneaky attacky,
right?

01:42:56.467 --> 01:42:58.237
MATT: Correct. You only get once per round.

01:42:58.237 --> 01:43:03.953
SAM: Much better. 11, and I'll use Fury of the
Small to make it 16.

01:43:03.953 --> 01:43:09.211
MATT: All righty, it's looking really hurt. It's
real hurt.

01:43:09.211 --> 01:43:11.126
LAURA: Fjord gets it.

01:43:11.126 --> 01:43:12.558
MARISHA: Get it, Fjord.

01:43:12.558 --> 01:43:14.311
MATT: Well, Fjord, what are you doing?

01:43:14.311 --> 01:43:18.743
SAM: Oh, you know, maybe don't kill it. We can
interrogate it.

01:43:18.743 --> 01:43:22.124
MATT: Because you guys are going at the same time,
you can figure out, these are simultaneous.

01:43:22.124 --> 01:43:24.741
TRAVIS: I'll take just enough of a step back to
use Eldritch Blast again and I'll fire both of

01:43:24.741 --> 01:43:26.149
them at it.

01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:27.008
MATT: Two strikes on it.

01:43:27.008 --> 01:43:29.877
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast, 14?

01:43:29.877 --> 01:43:36.197
MATT: 14 just hits. These are with advantage
because it's stunned, don't forget.

01:43:36.197 --> 01:43:40.151
TRAVIS: Oh shit. The first one was better. 14 as
well on the second one.

01:43:40.151 --> 01:43:41.269
MATT: Yeah, both hit.

01:43:41.269 --> 01:43:54.909
TRAVIS: Okay, great. (counting) 19 points.

01:43:54.909 --> 01:43:58.673
MATT: 19 points of damage, how do you and Nott
want to do this?

01:43:58.673 --> 01:43:59.907
SAM: What did you use to attack?

01:43:59.907 --> 01:44:00.563
TRAVIS: What did you do?

01:44:00.563 --> 01:44:02.464
SAM: I shot it with the thing.

01:44:02.464 --> 01:44:07.751
TRAVIS: I'll light it up with this crackling green
Eldritch Blast energy coming from both of my

01:44:07.751 --> 01:44:14.144
palms, causing its fur to smoke and burn off and
its snake heads to repel!

01:44:14.144 --> 01:44:19.772
SAM: Oh my god, that's so visceral and amazing.
I'll shoot it in the nose.

01:44:19.893 --> 01:44:29.750
MATT: Its torso erupts in green flame and energy,
just (explosion). The body slinks to the ground in

01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:36.808
a smoldering cinder and as it's head (moaning),
(arrow impact).

01:44:36.808 --> 01:44:40.262
TRAVIS: I'll look over at Nott.

01:44:40.262 --> 01:44:48.460
MATT: You guys all take a moment. Make a
perception check of the jungle around you.

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.075
MARISHA: Wait, who? All of us?

01:44:50.075 --> 01:44:52.314
TRAVIS: All of us. Six.

01:44:52.314 --> 01:44:53.525
LIAM: 12.

01:44:53.525 --> 01:44:54.964
SAM: Oh. Jester's asleep.

01:44:54.964 --> 01:44:55.916
MARISHA: Three.

01:44:55.916 --> 01:44:59.321
SAM: Quick! Hey, hey, hey!

01:44:59.321 --> 01:45:00.226
TALIESIN: 13.

01:45:00.226 --> 01:45:01.625
MATT: 13, okay.

01:45:01.625 --> 01:45:03.325
MARISHA: Ten.

01:45:03.325 --> 01:45:04.884
LAURA: Keep hitting me.

01:45:04.884 --> 01:45:07.860
SAM: Hey! Fjord! She needs some mouth-to-mouth.

01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.736
MATT: You can use an action to wake her.

01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:11.484
SAM and LAURA: Oh.

01:45:11.484 --> 01:45:16.701
MATT: Jester, you come to consciousness and you're
half-curled on Avantika, who's half-curled on you

01:45:16.701 --> 01:45:19.874
since you guys passed out right next to each
other.

01:45:19.874 --> 01:45:23.519
LIAM: Caleb is going to quick-walk over to
Avantika, kneel down and say, "Are you all

01:45:23.519 --> 01:45:30.008
right?!" with his back to Spaghetti and cast
Identify on one of the swords.

01:45:30.008 --> 01:45:36.867
MATT: Okay. Make a deception check.

01:45:36.867 --> 01:45:39.513
LIAM: Okay. My back is to him.

01:45:39.513 --> 01:45:44.235
MATT: I know. There's still motions involved.

01:45:44.235 --> 01:45:46.350
TRAVIS: "Are you okay?"

01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:52.047
LIAM: It was almost a one, but it wasn't. That's
pretty good. It's 19.

01:45:52.047 --> 01:45:57.551
MATT: As you bend down and focus on the blade--
which one, the dagger or the rapier?

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:58.613
LIAM: The rapier.

01:45:58.613 --> 01:46:01.873
MATT: The rapier is a plus one rapier. Nothing too
crazy or special--

01:46:01.873 --> 01:46:03.556
LAURA: Aw, should have focused on the dagger.

01:46:03.556 --> 01:46:04.974
LIAM: Pat the cheeks.

01:46:04.974 --> 01:46:10.413
MATT: Okay. She comes to and pushes you away for a
second and pulls the blade and puts her back up to

01:46:10.413 --> 01:46:14.520
the wall and has both blades out and is coming to
consciousness, but instinctually is defensive.

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:15.747
LIAM: We're good.

01:46:15.747 --> 01:46:21.172
TALIESIN: I'm going to gather in and keep an eye
out before I come back into visual-- I'm about to

01:46:21.172 --> 01:46:23.571
become visible again.

01:46:23.571 --> 01:46:26.014
LAURA: Did we win?

01:46:26.014 --> 01:46:27.557
SAM: We won.

01:46:27.557 --> 01:46:31.821
TRAVIS: I don't know that we did; there were only
two of them, and because Caleb left the bubble, it

01:46:31.821 --> 01:46:33.351
disappeared, right?

01:46:33.351 --> 01:46:37.531
LIAM: It's gone, but it only takes me 11 minutes.
I don't know, are we safe where we are?

01:46:37.531 --> 01:46:43.879
LAURA: We can do the bubble here and have this
wall take up some of the bubble space, or we can

01:46:43.879 --> 01:46:46.156
be right next to this wall.

01:46:46.156 --> 01:46:49.071
TRAVIS: We made a bit of a ruckus, that's the last
thing you want to do in a jungle.

01:46:49.071 --> 01:46:50.911
TALIESIN: Are we what?

01:46:50.911 --> 01:46:51.968
SAM: Are you okay?

01:46:51.968 --> 01:46:53.115
TALIESIN: Uh.

01:46:53.115 --> 01:46:55.494
SAM: You don't look very good, Mr. Clay.

01:46:55.494 --> 01:46:58.765
TALIESIN: Thank you. I'm going to Cure Wounds.

01:46:58.765 --> 01:46:59.623
SAM: On yourself?

01:46:59.623 --> 01:47:00.861
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:47:00.861 --> 01:47:03.799
LIAM: Did they seem like intelligent beasts?

01:47:03.799 --> 01:47:11.298
LAURA: I'm going to do it to you, too.

01:47:11.298 --> 01:47:16.031
MATT: From what brief encounter you had, it's hard
to say. Make a nature check-- actually, no, this

01:47:16.031 --> 01:47:22.755
would not be a nature. This is not a natural
creature. Make a general intelligence check.

01:47:22.755 --> 01:47:25.143
LIAM: That's better. That's a 20.

01:47:25.143 --> 01:47:30.855
MATT: 20? They don't appear to be. They're more
intelligent than some creatures in nature, but

01:47:30.855 --> 01:47:32.422
there isn't any sort of--

01:47:32.422 --> 01:47:33.667
LIAM: Still animalistic.

01:47:33.667 --> 01:47:37.016
MATT: Yeah, still animalistic. They are natural to
this island at the very least.

01:47:37.016 --> 01:47:43.334
LIAM: Knowing that, I would recommend that if I
make the bubble again, even if some more of them

01:47:43.334 --> 01:47:47.446
come, as long as we stay safe for the next ten
minutes, if they come, we will be still and

01:47:47.446 --> 01:47:52.215
sleeping and all they would see is a round stone.
They're animals, they will leave.

01:47:52.215 --> 01:47:56.106
TRAVIS: Agreed. We should rally up back-to-back
while Caleb casts it.

01:47:56.106 --> 01:48:01.241
SAM: Are we going to leave the two dead animal
bodies right here, next to where we're camping?

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:02.970
Because that could stink.

01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:05.571
LAURA: We'll move over to where our bubble was
before, how about that?

01:48:05.571 --> 01:48:06.544
SAM: Okay.

01:48:06.544 --> 01:48:10.138
TALIESIN: I'll start them going too, so that wont
be a thing for very long.

01:48:10.138 --> 01:48:12.052
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Start them going.

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:15.072
LIAM: I will begin my ritual spell in the same
spot.

01:48:15.072 --> 01:48:15.727
MATT: Okay.

01:48:15.727 --> 01:48:17.155
SAM: What were you guys doing out here?

01:48:17.155 --> 01:48:19.389
LAURA: I was sleeping. Did you notice?

01:48:19.389 --> 01:48:21.366
SAM: No, but before that. Why did you come out
here?

01:48:21.366 --> 01:48:22.522
TALIESIN: What?

01:48:22.522 --> 01:48:28.640
SAM: I will whisper to you: Why did you come out
here in the first place? Why were you walking

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:30.465
around in the dark, alone?

01:48:30.465 --> 01:48:31.887
TALIESIN: No need to yell, that's all right.

01:48:31.887 --> 01:48:33.837
SAM: I'm whispering!

01:48:33.837 --> 01:48:40.856
TALIESIN: We were just looking at the temple,
trying to get an idea of what it was.

01:48:40.856 --> 01:48:44.989
LAURA: Yeah, he was holding his light up really
bright and seeing if he could find any words and

01:48:44.989 --> 01:48:48.885
stuff. I think they might notice some light.

01:48:48.885 --> 01:48:52.106
TALIESIN: Yeah, that may have been a poor call.

01:48:52.106 --> 01:48:55.213
LAURA: It's okay! We're learning things.

01:48:55.213 --> 01:49:00.173
TALIESIN: I definitely feel like I've learned-- I
think I need to pass out.

01:49:00.173 --> 01:49:05.255
LAURA: A good night of sleep will do you very
well.

01:49:05.255 --> 01:49:07.796
MARISHA: Does everything in this jungle have snake
heads?

01:49:07.796 --> 01:49:10.061
TRAVIS: I think that's a fair assumption.

01:49:10.061 --> 01:49:15.517
LAURA: Or snake legs or snake arms or snake
dicks.

01:49:15.517 --> 01:49:18.068
LIAM: Mecca lecca hi mecca hiney ho.

01:49:18.068 --> 01:49:21.070
MATT: You complete your ritual spell and the Tiny
Hut is completed.

01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:23.760
LAURA: Into the bubble.

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:32.640
MATT: At this point, Jamedi goes, "Actually, I
will be, if possible, interested in staying within

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:34.724
"this this time."

01:49:34.724 --> 01:49:37.042
SAM: Oh, all right.

01:49:37.164 --> 01:49:40.762
MATT: He grabs a few things from the tent-- and
it's a very tight space. Nine creatures is the

01:49:40.762 --> 01:49:50.271
max, right? You've hit the maximum. You all manage
to fit in there in a not terribly comfortable space.

01:49:50.271 --> 01:49:53.934
LIAM: Ten-foot radius, so 20 from one side to the
other.

01:49:53.934 --> 01:49:59.255
TRAVIS: I still think one of us should stay up in
shifts inside this bubble. Just in case.

01:49:59.255 --> 01:50:03.075
LIAM: Ja, I'll take the first shift. I'm good.
I'm very jittery tonight.

01:50:03.075 --> 01:50:06.073
SAM: I'll stay up with you.

01:50:06.073 --> 01:50:10.728
LIAM: Frumpkin, by the way, is flitting about a
little bit from person to person while we talk.

01:50:10.728 --> 01:50:15.784
Even lands on Avantika's shoulder a little bit and
does a little--

01:50:15.784 --> 01:50:21.099
LAURA: I bring Sprinkle out from inside my hood
and make sure he was okay during that whole fight.

01:50:21.099 --> 01:50:28.223
MATT: Sprinkle, who is not necessarily used to the
type of weather, appears to be very uncomfortable

01:50:28.223 --> 01:50:32.232
in the heat and being tucked into the cloth and is
like, (chittering).

01:50:32.232 --> 01:50:34.565
LAURA: I give him some water and some little
food.

01:50:34.565 --> 01:50:35.718
TRAVIS: What are you doing to that poor dog?

01:50:35.718 --> 01:50:38.538
LAURA: I'm sorry, buddy. (kissing)

01:50:38.538 --> 01:50:47.173
MATT: This is the crimson weasel. The dog is with
the Ruby of the Sea.

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:48.416
TRAVIS: Eh, whatever.

01:50:48.416 --> 01:50:55.257
LIAM: Entschuldigung, I'm sorry. Now the owl is
pitter-patting on Avantika's hat.

01:50:55.257 --> 01:50:58.363
MATT: Just walking along the hat?

01:50:58.363 --> 01:51:02.484
LIAM: Not constantly, but in a cute way.

01:51:02.484 --> 01:51:08.559
LAURA: Caleb-- I whisper in his ear: Make it poop.
Make it poop on her hat.

01:51:08.559 --> 01:51:12.972
LIAM: Are you putting the umlaut over the o's in
the poop? Pyoop?

01:51:12.972 --> 01:51:14.404
LAURA: What are you talking about?

01:51:14.404 --> 01:51:15.669
SAM: You said "pyoop."

01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:20.265
MATT: Avantika puts the finger up towards
Frumpkin.

01:51:20.265 --> 01:51:22.375
MARISHA: Don't do it.

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:25.068
LIAM: He flitters up to the finger.

01:51:25.068 --> 01:51:26.938
LAURA: Make it poop on her finger.

01:51:26.938 --> 01:51:28.477
MARISHA: Unrealistic.

01:51:28.477 --> 01:51:34.456
LIAM: He does whatever I say. He bats his little
one-ounce owl eyes at Avantika.

01:51:34.456 --> 01:51:37.778
MATT: "Interesting."

01:51:37.778 --> 01:51:43.858
MARISHA: Have you never seen an owl before?

01:51:43.858 --> 01:51:46.675
MATT: "Not one so small and adorable and is
docile."

01:51:46.675 --> 01:51:49.205
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. It's pretty cute.

01:51:49.205 --> 01:51:51.018
LIAM: Frumpkin poops.

01:51:51.018 --> 01:52:00.178
MARISHA: Really? Hey, Avantika. How many dudes you
think you killed?

01:52:00.178 --> 01:52:03.812
MATT: "What, in all of my years?"

01:52:03.812 --> 01:52:04.592
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:52:04.592 --> 01:52:08.463
MATT: "I don't know. I stopped counting at around
50."

01:52:08.463 --> 01:52:12.215
MARISHA: Oh. That's awesome.

01:52:12.215 --> 01:52:12.856
TRAVIS: That's a high number.

01:52:12.856 --> 01:52:14.767
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a big number.

01:52:14.767 --> 01:52:21.881
MATT: "But in my line of work, it's important to
not hesitate when some drunk asshole tries to, I

01:52:21.881 --> 01:52:26.220
"don't know, take your ship."

01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:30.185
MARISHA: We can't relate at all, nope.

01:52:30.185 --> 01:52:38.722
MATT: "Well, anyway. I will be taking a nap with
one eye open. Good night, everyone." She settles

01:52:38.722 --> 01:52:52.194
into her camping garb. Who's keeping watch? All
right. Make perception checks for the first watch, guys.

01:52:52.194 --> 01:52:54.330
SAM: We're inside the bubble, right?

01:52:54.330 --> 01:52:55.154
MATT: Yeah.

01:52:55.154 --> 01:52:55.956
LAURA: But you can hear things.

01:52:55.956 --> 01:52:57.713
SAM: 12.

01:52:57.713 --> 01:53:06.010
LIAM: One. Also, we're being very quiet because we
don't want to be heard, but while we're in here,

01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:14.994
Frumpkin, over a period of ten or 15 minutes, you
see this, goes (pitter-patting) along the ground

01:53:14.994 --> 01:53:19.700
and hops onto Avantika's boot.

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:20.851
MATT: Okay.

01:53:20.851 --> 01:53:29.786
LIAM: (pitter-pattering) Eventually stands on top
of her dagger, and I cast Identify through touch

01:53:29.786 --> 01:53:34.351
of my familiar. And he weighs one ounce.

01:53:34.351 --> 01:53:35.527
MATT: Yeah, that's true.

01:53:35.527 --> 01:53:37.255
TRAVIS: One ounce is good.

01:53:37.255 --> 01:53:40.476
TALIESIN: One ounce owl. It's the best band.

01:53:40.476 --> 01:53:45.524
MARISHA: The One Ounce Owl?

01:53:46.081 --> 01:53:55.506
MATT: Avantika, who, as mentioned before, was
sleeping with one eye open, essentially, is rested

01:53:55.506 --> 01:54:03.626
there and then right as you begin to go through
the actions of casting, there is a flash of motion.

01:54:03.626 --> 01:54:07.279
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, no.

01:54:07.279 --> 01:54:11.711
MATT: What is Frumpkin's armor class?

01:54:11.711 --> 01:54:16.224
LIAM: Oh, I'm sure it's terrible. Hold on a
second.

01:54:16.224 --> 01:54:19.725
SAM: Go to the creature tab on D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

01:54:19.725 --> 01:54:21.221
LIAM: I am. It is 11.

01:54:21.221 --> 01:54:32.471
MATT: Frumpkin suffers five points of piercing
damage as Avantika instinctually (slashing, panting).

01:54:32.471 --> 01:54:36.434
LIAM: Why did you do that?

01:54:36.434 --> 01:54:38.622
MATT: "Why did you do that?"

01:54:38.622 --> 01:54:40.827
LIAM: You know why I did that.

01:54:40.827 --> 01:54:44.270
MATT: "And you know why I did that."

01:54:46.549 --> 01:54:48.780
LIAM: Ey.

01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:55.738
MATT: "Be glad it was just your owl. Please do not
go peering where it is not wanted, eh?"

01:54:55.738 --> 01:54:59.882
LIAM: Okay. Don't mind me while I make another
owl. I begin casting Find Familiar to bring back

01:54:59.882 --> 01:55:03.354
Frumpkin as a one-ounce owl.

01:55:03.354 --> 01:55:06.548
(laughter)

01:55:06.548 --> 01:55:08.144
MATT: Recycling Frumpkin.

01:55:08.144 --> 01:55:13.955
LIAM: I promised Beauregard an owl for a week, so
I can't have my cat back. Ten minutes later,

01:55:13.955 --> 01:55:16.028
there's an owl. Watch is over.

01:55:16.028 --> 01:55:20.525
MATT: You finish your watch, seemingly uneventful.
Towards the tail end of it, you do see a shape of

01:55:20.525 --> 01:55:29.942
another one of those leopard-like creatures that
stalks on the outskirts of the strange, opaque orb

01:55:29.942 --> 01:55:39.363
you've created and approaches it. (sniffing)
Circles around it for a bit, prods at it every now

01:55:39.363 --> 01:55:44.371
and then. Spends about 40 minutes or so keeping a
watch and then eventually loses interest and

01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:46.165
wanders off into the jungle.

01:55:46.165 --> 01:55:47.381
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:55:47.381 --> 01:55:49.628
LIAM: (whispering) I like cats.

01:55:49.628 --> 01:55:52.424
SAM: Not that kind.

01:55:52.424 --> 01:55:56.925
MATT: All right, next watch? Who's taking next
watch? We only need one more watch; I think. Jester?

01:55:56.925 --> 01:56:04.924
LAURA: On the way-- because I got a pretty good
amount of sleep during that fight-- can I ask

01:56:04.924 --> 01:56:06.951
Caleb, before he goes to sleep: Hey, Caleb!

01:56:06.951 --> 01:56:07.689
LIAM: Yeah?

01:56:07.689 --> 01:56:10.567
LAURA: Could we stick things through the bubble?

01:56:10.567 --> 01:56:18.543
LIAM: Ja, you can go out and in, and you can--
sorry. You can put your weapons through it, but no

01:56:18.543 --> 01:56:24.245
magic will go in or out. But you can leave and
come back anytime you want.

01:56:24.245 --> 01:56:26.156
LAURA: Okay, just checking.

01:56:26.156 --> 01:56:28.438
LIAM: But please don't go on any walkabouts while
we are sleeping.

01:56:28.438 --> 01:56:29.724
LAURA: I'm not going to, Caleb.

01:56:29.724 --> 01:56:31.075
LIAM: But you already did.

01:56:31.075 --> 01:56:34.326
LAURA: Well, that was for Caduceus. Don't worry
about it, okay?

01:56:34.326 --> 01:56:35.455
LIAM: Do you promise?

01:56:35.455 --> 01:56:38.756
LAURA: Of course I promise. I'm going to stay in
here.

01:56:38.756 --> 01:56:40.339
LIAM: That is good enough for me. Good night.

01:56:40.339 --> 01:56:42.225
LAURA: Good night.

01:56:42.225 --> 01:56:45.299
LIAM: (snoring)

01:56:45.299 --> 01:56:47.787
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:56:48.910 --> 01:56:51.467
SAM and TRAVIS: Jesus.

01:56:51.467 --> 01:56:54.055
LAURA: 20.

01:56:54.055 --> 01:57:02.113
MATT: Jamedi stays up to also take watch with you.
Oh, nice. He sits across the opposite way, and

01:57:02.113 --> 01:57:08.421
you're watching this way over his shoulder, and
he's looking over yours and doesn't engage in

01:57:08.421 --> 01:57:10.746
conversation, unless you wish to.

01:57:10.746 --> 01:57:13.378
LAURA: Have you ever seen those cat things
before?

01:57:13.378 --> 01:57:19.367
MATT: "I have seen them my first time passing
through here, yes, but I was quieter."

01:57:19.367 --> 01:57:22.652
LAURA: Yeah, we're pretty loud sometimes.

01:57:22.652 --> 01:57:29.612
MATT: "You are correct. This has been a bit more
challenging than I originally anticipated."

01:57:29.612 --> 01:57:33.053
LAURA: Have you thought at all about the
Traveler?

01:57:33.053 --> 01:57:35.385
MATT: "No."

01:57:35.385 --> 01:57:38.706
LAURA: Do you want a pamphlet?

01:57:38.706 --> 01:57:42.215
MATT: "I am confused as to what you are speaking
of."

01:57:42.215 --> 01:57:46.752
LAURA: (whispering) The Traveler.

01:57:46.752 --> 01:57:48.003
MATT: "You are strange."

01:57:48.003 --> 01:57:49.726
LAURA: He's everywhere.

01:57:49.726 --> 01:57:50.842
MATT: "And creepy."

01:57:50.842 --> 01:57:56.909
LAURA: He's really great. I'll give you a
pamphlet. I get it out, and I walk it over to him. Here.

01:57:56.909 --> 01:58:04.440
MATT: It takes a solid ten seconds of him
inspecting it and looking up at you before he--

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:09.987
LAURA: Just read it over. There's a lot of
information in there. It's really important.

01:58:09.987 --> 01:58:12.383
MATT: "Much appreciated."

01:58:12.383 --> 01:58:13.934
LAURA: He's here right now.

01:58:13.934 --> 01:58:15.949
MATT: Tucks it away into the inside of his vest.

01:58:15.949 --> 01:58:21.322
LAURA: Traveler! If you're here, you should show
him you're here so that he will like you even more

01:58:21.322 --> 01:58:30.013
than he already does! Just give it a minute.

01:58:30.013 --> 01:58:37.531
MATT: (farting noise) You're not quite sure who it
was on that side that let one loose in their

01:58:37.531 --> 01:58:41.640
sleep, but the inside of the dome suddenly has a
very fragrant air.

01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:42.804
SAM: Dutch oven.

01:58:42.804 --> 01:58:47.285
LIAM: To be fair, we all had Indian for dinner
tonight, so it could be any one of us.

01:58:47.285 --> 01:58:52.830
LAURA: He has cast his blessing upon us.

01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:58.775
MATT: "Really, the most impressive of miracles."

01:58:58.775 --> 01:59:01.264
LAURA: How long have you been working for Captain
Avantika?

01:59:01.264 --> 01:59:03.319
MATT: "Only for this journey and once before."

01:59:03.319 --> 01:59:04.872
LAURA: Do you like her a lot?

01:59:04.872 --> 01:59:07.825
MATT: "She pays well. Does not judge."

01:59:07.825 --> 01:59:10.815
LAURA: What were you doing before you were working
for her?

01:59:10.815 --> 01:59:12.585
MATT: "Working for other people."

01:59:12.585 --> 01:59:16.185
LAURA: What's the craziest thing you've ever
done?

01:59:16.185 --> 01:59:25.555
MATT: His eyes narrow at you. "I was the only
survivor to the escaping singular mines to the

01:59:25.555 --> 01:59:31.326
"north area of the continent. How far have you
traveled outside of the Empire?"

01:59:31.326 --> 01:59:34.448
LAURA: I'm from the Menagerie Coast, actually.

01:59:34.448 --> 01:59:35.941
MATT: "All right."

01:59:35.941 --> 01:59:38.978
LAURA: So that far.

01:59:38.978 --> 01:59:52.633
MATT: "I have delved into a few ruins. I have been
lucky enough to survive by working alone. I have

01:59:52.633 --> 02:00:03.959
"seen many friends fall and disappear, but I have
made my way. What's the craziest thing you have seen?"

02:00:03.959 --> 02:00:06.094
LAURA: Ever? In my life?

02:00:06.094 --> 02:00:08.325
MATT: "Sure."

02:00:08.325 --> 02:00:26.087
LAURA: Oh shit, I've seen some crazy shit. This
one time I saw a bug carrying a piece of bread

02:00:26.201 --> 02:00:34.118
that was like five times its size and he was
carrying it up stairs. Like up and then he would

02:00:34.118 --> 02:00:38.156
turn and then it would go up and then he would
turn.

02:00:38.156 --> 02:00:39.772
MATT: "Will wonders ever cease?"

02:00:39.772 --> 02:00:48.384
(laughter)

02:00:48.384 --> 02:00:54.581
MATT: "I'm going to concentrate on our
surroundings for the remainder of our shift if you

02:00:54.581 --> 02:00:57.251
"do not mind."

02:00:57.251 --> 02:00:59.142
LAURA: Me too.

02:00:59.142 --> 02:01:02.895
MATT: He looks out. Now towards the tail end of
your shift as the sunlight begins to slowly peak--

02:01:02.895 --> 02:01:08.274
LIAM: It's a slow roll laughter. It took a minute
and then it caught like fire.

02:01:08.274 --> 02:01:12.438
(laughter)

02:01:12.438 --> 02:01:16.090
MATT: There is some more shifting in the nearby
bushes and you see two figures beginning to

02:01:16.090 --> 02:01:18.245
approach the sphere.

02:01:18.245 --> 02:01:21.432
LAURA: (whispering) Oh shit!

02:01:21.432 --> 02:01:27.436
MATT: "Shh." He gets his short bow ready and nocks
an arrow.

02:01:27.436 --> 02:01:30.137
LAURA: (whispering) If they stab through--

02:01:30.137 --> 02:01:35.758
MATT: "Maybe. Just shh." As you guys wait you can
see, similar to what you had previously seen in

02:01:35.758 --> 02:01:41.139
your travels on this island, two lizard men
armored. One carrying a net that's slung over his

02:01:41.139 --> 02:01:46.148
shoulder, the other with a long spear both with
shields off to the side. Not ready for aggression,

02:01:46.148 --> 02:01:51.154
but they both approach slowly towards the strange
sphere and begin inspecting it.

02:01:51.154 --> 02:01:53.083
LAURA: (whispering) I put my hand on Fjord's leg.

02:01:53.083 --> 02:01:54.344
SAM: Upper thigh?

02:01:54.344 --> 02:01:57.708
LAURA: Shh.

02:01:57.708 --> 02:02:07.482
MATT: (lizard men talking) He pokes it with the
spear. The other one steps forward and licks it.

02:02:07.482 --> 02:02:20.883
They both begin to walk around and inspect it,
prod and poke it. Jamedi-- you can see he's just

02:02:20.883 --> 02:02:23.980
looking out very intensely, bow notched.

02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:33.759
LAURA: (whispering) I poke Beau.

02:02:33.759 --> 02:02:40.192
MATT: They both circle around the back end of it,
poke the dome a few more times. One of them picks

02:02:40.192 --> 02:02:46.396
up a rock and throws it at it. It skips off of the
exterior of it and rests in a nearby bush. They

02:02:46.396 --> 02:02:56.026
both step forward one more time and smell it
closely. They both turn around and begin to make

02:02:56.026 --> 02:03:02.028
their way in the opposite direction of where the
dome is set, making their way further into the

02:03:02.028 --> 02:03:09.524
jungle clearing. One of them stops and looks back
behind one more time at the dome and turns back

02:03:09.524 --> 02:03:11.750
and both of them vanish into the nearby brush.

02:03:11.801 --> 02:03:13.979
LAURA: Is it getting light yet?

02:03:13.979 --> 02:03:18.430
MATT: It is. There's no sign of the sun but it's
that early morning soft blue that starting to

02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:21.986
overtake the evening's night.

02:03:21.986 --> 02:03:25.170
LAURA: We should wake up. Everybody should wake
up. We should get out of here before they come

02:03:25.170 --> 02:03:26.466
back with more people.

02:03:26.466 --> 02:03:27.098
SAM: Who?

02:03:27.098 --> 02:03:30.178
LAURA: There were I think-- I couldn't tell. They
were shadowy, but I think they were like lizard

02:03:30.178 --> 02:03:31.434
men or snake men.

02:03:31.434 --> 02:03:32.348
SAM: Oh gosh.

02:03:32.348 --> 02:03:33.132
TALIESIN: All right.

02:03:33.132 --> 02:03:34.777
LAURA: Could you tell?

02:03:34.777 --> 02:03:39.883
MATT: "I would say that they are probably very
close to the ones we saw before."

02:03:39.883 --> 02:03:42.475
LAURA: Which ones? The lizard men or the snake
men?

02:03:42.475 --> 02:03:45.895
MATT: "They appear to be of the lizard men
heritage."

02:03:45.895 --> 02:03:51.972
LAURA: We should get out of here even though the
lizard men are obviously the weaker of the two. Caleb.

02:03:51.972 --> 02:03:53.077
LIAM: Hm?

02:03:53.077 --> 02:03:54.534
LAURA: We should get up and get out of here.

02:03:54.534 --> 02:03:55.725
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

02:03:55.725 --> 02:03:57.487
MARISHA: They know where we are. They can ambush
us.

02:03:57.487 --> 02:03:59.190
SAM: Did we get a long rest?

02:03:59.190 --> 02:04:01.588
MATT: You did get a long rest.

02:04:01.588 --> 02:04:03.265
SAM: Oh good.

02:04:03.265 --> 02:04:06.565
LIAM: Okay well, say the word and I'll pull it
down.

02:04:06.565 --> 02:04:08.332
TRAVIS: Let's get everything together first.

02:04:08.332 --> 02:04:10.244
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:04:10.244 --> 02:04:13.073
TRAVIS: Jamedi? Following you.

02:04:13.073 --> 02:04:15.955
MATT: "All right, collect your belongings." He
goes over and starts disassembling his tent

02:04:15.955 --> 02:04:19.173
quickly, rolling it up and putting it into his
pack over his shoulder. You guys gather your things.

02:04:19.173 --> 02:04:25.019
LAURA: Should we make the brush look like we
weren't sleeping on it and stuff?

02:04:25.019 --> 02:04:27.156
SAM: Why?

02:04:27.156 --> 02:04:29.497
LAURA: You know, so that they won't be able to
like--

02:04:29.497 --> 02:04:30.786
MATT: Make a survival check, Beau.

02:04:30.786 --> 02:04:33.751
MARISHA: Okay. Following Jester's lead--

02:04:33.751 --> 02:04:35.286
LIAM: Do the running man in the mud, Beau.

02:04:35.286 --> 02:04:38.527
MARISHA: It's not great. Nine.

02:04:38.527 --> 02:04:41.448
MATT: There are a series of foot grooves in the
dirt--

02:04:41.448 --> 02:04:42.522
MARISHA: Good enough.

02:04:42.522 --> 02:04:43.333
SAM: Yeah.

02:04:43.333 --> 02:04:46.320
MATT: It doesn't look like anybody slept here. It
looks like a bunch of people kicked here.

02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:47.374
LAURA: Okay, good great.

02:04:47.374 --> 02:04:50.387
(laughter)

02:04:50.387 --> 02:04:51.916
TRAVIS: River dancers.

02:04:51.916 --> 02:04:58.553
MATT: Yeah. You gather your things. Jamedi leads
you back towards the jungle. "All right a few more

02:04:58.553 --> 02:05:02.056
"hours and I think we'll be in the outskirts of the
village."

02:05:02.056 --> 02:05:04.546
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us
again.

02:05:04.546 --> 02:05:08.382
MATT: All right. So... yes?

02:05:08.382 --> 02:05:15.517
SAM: Mr. Jamedi? What are we going to find when we
get there? Are there any baddies?

02:05:15.517 --> 02:05:20.840
MATT: "Oh there are plenty of these snake people
where they live. We'll have to be very quiet.

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:26.586
"We'll have to gauge our passage through their town
and try to not be seen. And if we are seen,

02:05:26.586 --> 02:05:32.395
"eliminate whoever catches us before it can notify
the rest of them of our presence. Make our way

02:05:32.395 --> 02:05:39.008
"towards the central structure. Trust me. You'll
know it when you see it." He looks back to

02:05:39.008 --> 02:05:43.795
Avantika and says "And I believe that is the
quarry in which you paid for, beneath that.

02:05:43.795 --> 02:05:54.456
"Correct?" Avantika goes "That is correct. In we go
and see where it takes us. So shall we? Jamedi,

02:05:54.456 --> 02:06:01.540
"lead the way." "All right come forward." You all
begin to slowly make your way into the jungle as

02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:04.565
you cast Pass Without a Trace and we'll come back
at the end of the break.

02:06:04.565 --> 02:06:05.737
LAURA: Whoa!

02:06:05.737 --> 02:06:06.738
LIAM: Owl on your head.

02:06:06.738 --> 02:06:07.362
MATT: There you go.

02:06:07.362 --> 02:06:08.533
MARISHA: Oh no god!

02:06:08.533 --> 02:06:10.923
MATT: Stealth owl. All right, we're going to take
a quick break and come back to that with that

02:06:10.923 --> 02:06:17.282
stealth check and this next leg of the journey
into the island of Urukaxl. Um... what's up?

02:06:17.282 --> 02:06:20.053
SAM: The giveaway just happens now. We don't have
to say anything.

02:06:20.053 --> 02:06:21.354
MATT: Yeah, well...

02:06:21.354 --> 02:06:21.968
SAM: Oh we do?

02:06:21.968 --> 02:06:22.901
MATT: No, we do. It's still here.

02:06:22.901 --> 02:06:23.584
SAM: Awesome.

02:06:23.584 --> 02:06:30.828
MATT: So we have our fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway
tonight. We have-- here we are. So moving forward

02:06:30.828 --> 02:06:34.860
you'll have to move into the chat-- that's how
it's been-- move into the Critical Role chat on

02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:40.909
Twitch. That's twitch.tv/criticalrole. To win
tonight's awesome Wenge Turquoise Inlay Halloween

02:06:40.909 --> 02:06:42.006
Dice Vault.

02:06:42.006 --> 02:06:43.295
(Oohs)

02:06:43.295 --> 02:06:44.272
LAURA: What does it say?

02:06:44.272 --> 02:06:46.582
MATT: It's available now through Halloween on
Kickstarter for it.

02:06:46.582 --> 02:06:47.825
MARISHA: Halloween!

02:06:47.825 --> 02:06:48.924
MATT: Yeah.

02:06:48.924 --> 02:06:50.108
MARISHA: It needs to be all the time.

02:06:50.108 --> 02:06:52.483
MATT: It's a dice vault that keeps all your dice
magnetically held together and it has this cool,

02:06:52.483 --> 02:06:59.460
glowing runic sigils on it as well as this glowing
Wyrmwood symbol. You can find these at Wyrmwood on

02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:04.652
the Kickstarter currently. The keyword tonight is
jungle. So go ahead and put jungle in once. More

02:07:04.652 --> 02:07:09.198
than once you'll be disqualified. Once again, only
available for those in the U.S. and Canada,

02:07:09.198 --> 02:07:14.307
excluding Quebec. We're working on it. Anyway
we'll be back here in a few minutes. We'll see you

02:07:14.307 --> 02:07:14.613
guys shortly.

02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:21.502
MATT: Welcome back everyone. So, before we back
into the story we have our winner for the dice

02:07:21.502 --> 02:07:24.800
vault giveaway. Our winner is wolfstarumbra.

02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:25.866
TRAVIS: Ooh.

02:07:25.866 --> 02:07:28.364
MATT: Now if that doesn't sound like someone's D&amp;amp;D
character, I don't know what does.

02:07:28.364 --> 02:07:35.957
Wolfstar, congratulations. We'll get your
information and the dice vault sent out to you.

02:07:36.257 --> 02:07:37.180
MARISHA: It's like a synth wave album.

02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:39.063
MATT: It is true. We are... wolfstarumbra (synth
noises).

02:07:39.063 --> 02:07:42.156
TALIESIN: Wolfstar is a total space cowboy.

02:07:42.156 --> 02:07:43.835
MATT: That's true. Sorry, wolfstar.

02:07:43.835 --> 02:07:45.041
TALIESIN: Thank you, wolfstar!

02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:47.168
ALL: (laughter)

02:07:47.168 --> 02:07:51.521
MATT: All right. So now in the early morning
daylight--

02:07:51.521 --> 02:07:52.847
LAURA: I'll be right back.

02:07:52.847 --> 02:07:53.724
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:07:53.724 --> 02:07:54.404
SAM: Oh no.

02:07:54.404 --> 02:07:55.279
LAURA: Keep going.

02:07:55.279 --> 02:08:00.989
MATT: In the early morning daylight on Urukaxl
Island, you trudge deeper and deeper into the

02:08:00.989 --> 02:08:09.807
jungles, as the low mist in the jungle begins to
burn away as the day itself grows warmer. All of

02:08:09.807 --> 02:08:16.906
you getting a bit more adjusted to the temperature
and general atmosphere. Beau, you're feeling a

02:08:16.906 --> 02:08:17.851
little rough.

02:08:17.851 --> 02:08:18.692
MARISHA: Ah?

02:08:18.692 --> 02:08:19.618
SAM: What?

02:08:19.618 --> 02:08:24.318
MATT: You get this sweating a little bit and this
soreness in your body and this general body pain,

02:08:24.318 --> 02:08:28.018
kind of a dull pain throughout.

02:08:28.018 --> 02:08:29.199
LIAM: You've got mono.

02:08:29.199 --> 02:08:31.625
MARISHA: Nope. I'm great.

02:08:31.625 --> 02:08:38.974
MATT: Just kind of (sighs)... you're not quite
sure why it's come over you. Pressing on, Jamedi

02:08:38.974 --> 02:08:45.734
leads you for about another hour and a half, two
hours through the jungle before putting his hand

02:08:45.734 --> 02:08:50.858
up once more to stop you all. Oh we didn't make
the stealth check actually. Because I said when

02:08:50.858 --> 02:08:51.900
come back, yes.

02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:53.206
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace.

02:08:53.206 --> 02:08:54.850
MATT: Pass Without a Trace everybody.

02:08:54.850 --> 02:08:56.351
TRAVIS: And do I still have-- no I don't. Not
anymore.

02:08:56.351 --> 02:08:58.825
LIAM: Yeah! Natural 20 plus 10!

02:08:58.825 --> 02:09:00.291
TRAVIS: Do I have the thing?

02:09:00.291 --> 02:09:02.580
SAM: I think that was my--

02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:05.522
TALIESIN: Please tell me you've got Pass Without a
Trace up?

02:09:05.522 --> 02:09:06.597
LAURA: Yeah.

02:09:06.597 --> 02:09:07.499
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:09:07.499 --> 02:09:09.582
SAM: That was my seventh four of the night.

02:09:09.582 --> 02:09:11.268
TRAVIS: I don't happen to have the blessing on me?
Laura!

02:09:11.268 --> 02:09:13.201
LAURA: You rolled with advantage right?

02:09:13.201 --> 02:09:14.707
TRAVIS: Do I have a blessing anymore?

02:09:14.707 --> 02:09:15.584
MATT: No you've slept.

02:09:15.584 --> 02:09:16.381
LAURA: I didn't.

02:09:16.381 --> 02:09:18.182
LIAM: The blessing.

02:09:18.182 --> 02:09:18.663
TRAVIS: 14.

02:09:18.663 --> 02:09:19.369
MATT: 14.

02:09:19.369 --> 02:09:20.699
MARISHA: 33.

02:09:20.699 --> 02:09:22.234
LIAM: Woo!

02:09:22.234 --> 02:09:23.306
TALIESIN: Are you even here?

02:09:23.306 --> 02:09:25.316
LIAM: 30. Maxed out. Jeez.

02:09:25.316 --> 02:09:28.990
SAM: Laura reminds me that I roll with advantage
so I'm at a 30.

02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:30.586
MATT: There you go. Caleb?

02:09:30.586 --> 02:09:31.434
LIAM: 30.

02:09:31.434 --> 02:09:32.496
LAURA: 34.

02:09:32.496 --> 02:09:33.583
TALIESIN: 15.

02:09:33.583 --> 02:09:38.080
MATT: Okay and then Yasha. Natural 18, not bad.

02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:40.941
SAM: Wow. Stealthy mofos.

02:09:40.941 --> 02:09:45.612
MATT: You guys are cruising your way through the
jungle and using that score as you approach,

02:09:46.075 --> 02:09:51.925
Jamedi with his hand out behind him stopping you.
Glancing just past his shoulder, you can see the

02:09:51.925 --> 02:09:56.709
jungle trees begin to clear and the first thing
that catches your eye beyond this treeline, you

02:09:56.709 --> 02:10:02.311
can see a few dozen scattered stone buildings,
most of them in relatively good shape, immediately

02:10:02.311 --> 02:10:10.288
coming into view. You can see the stone coloration
is more of a sandstone, yellowish to a dull gray

02:10:10.288 --> 02:10:16.735
and white with different materials used to accent
elements of the constructions. This doesn't match

02:10:16.735 --> 02:10:23.729
the ruins you previously slept in the night
before. These appear to be fresher. You can see

02:10:23.729 --> 02:10:29.073
the verdant green jungle vines and roots begin to
entwine and tangle near the base of some of them

02:10:29.073 --> 02:10:33.901
and where it's built looks like parts of the
jungle have grown up around and helped camouflage

02:10:33.901 --> 02:10:40.771
elements of this small village. You can see
elements of the exposed stone carry snake-head

02:10:40.771 --> 02:10:48.246
obelisks that appear to be softly carved from bits
of a marble material or recovered stone in a

02:10:48.246 --> 02:10:50.532
similar way that most of the construction has been
done.

02:10:50.532 --> 02:10:54.482
SAM: Does it look like the figurine that I
recovered earlier?

02:10:55.008 --> 02:11:05.054
MATT: Similar sculpt and design though larger and
of more detail. You see these obelisks about ten

02:11:05.054 --> 02:11:13.158
feet tall and they tend to be markers at different
intersections of travel. You can see probably a

02:11:13.158 --> 02:11:19.553
dozen or so folk immediately at this position that
you're at that are wandering through this city.

02:11:19.553 --> 02:11:26.229
Some are gathering materials. You can see--
actually up the way across one of these walls, you

02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:32.084
see four figures that are strung up by their feet.
You can see the remnants of the lizard men that

02:11:32.084 --> 02:11:34.513
are in the process of having the flesh filleted
from their bodies.

02:11:34.513 --> 02:11:36.020
ALL: (moans of disgust)

02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:39.411
MATT: You see one of the more humanoid ones,
probably one of the hunters that you saw alongside

02:11:39.411 --> 02:11:46.402
the snake-armed man, is there with the blade,
stripping it off the bones and sloughing it into a

02:11:46.402 --> 02:11:50.978
pile next to it where you hear (squelching) over
on top of each other.

02:11:50.978 --> 02:11:55.309
LAURA: Oh that's fucked up. What do the obelisk
eyes look like?

02:11:55.309 --> 02:11:59.485
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:11:59.485 --> 02:12:00.886
LAURA: Eight.

02:12:00.886 --> 02:12:04.291
MATT: Hard to tell at this distance. You'd have to
get a lot closer.

02:12:04.291 --> 02:12:05.254
LAURA: Okay.

02:12:05.254 --> 02:12:10.441
TALIESIN: Who's got the mote this morning? Who
moted? Who dodeca-ed?

02:12:10.441 --> 02:12:12.530
LAURA: Oh dang we were going to pass it around.

02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:13.893
MARISHA: We were yeah.

02:12:13.893 --> 02:12:15.430
LIAM: It's somewhere in the building. We'll find
it.

02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:16.395
MARISHA: Okay.

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:18.654
SAM: Give it to Fjord again. This is his day.

02:12:18.654 --> 02:12:19.897
LAURA: Okay, Fjord.

02:12:19.897 --> 02:12:21.069
TRAVIS: Well I was going to--

02:12:21.069 --> 02:12:23.052
LAURA: Stare at it. Look into its eyes.

02:12:23.052 --> 02:12:24.897
TRAVIS: You don't want to give it to Caduceus?

02:12:24.897 --> 02:12:26.625
TALIESIN: I will not say no to it.

02:12:26.625 --> 02:12:27.849
LAURA: Look into its eyes.

02:12:27.849 --> 02:12:28.952
TRAVIS: Give it to him.

02:12:29.366 --> 02:12:30.194
TALIESIN: I don't know-- oh.

02:12:30.194 --> 02:12:32.295
(laughter)

02:12:32.295 --> 02:12:34.438
MATT: All right, you take your mote of
possibility.

02:12:34.438 --> 02:12:37.600
LIAM: And we are hanging back at this point but
not in the thick of it. We're seeing this all from

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:41.295
a distance? I was thinking about spells. Yeah.

02:12:41.295 --> 02:12:51.088
MARISHA: Remember if anything goes down, Fjord and
I will take point. Caduceus, I noticed before it

02:12:51.088 --> 02:12:57.291
seemed like you guys were poisoned immediately,
but not lingering?

02:12:57.291 --> 02:13:00.790
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm feeling fine.

02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:05.946
MARISHA: Are you? I'm not, like, saying anything.

02:13:05.946 --> 02:13:07.881
TALIESIN: Why?

02:13:07.881 --> 02:13:09.319
MARISHA: What?

02:13:09.319 --> 02:13:10.940
TALIESIN: You seem a little--

02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:12.007
MARISHA: Nope!

02:13:12.007 --> 02:13:13.072
TALIESIN: You sure?

02:13:13.072 --> 02:13:13.796
MARISHA: Yep!

02:13:13.796 --> 02:13:14.893
TALIESIN: I can do a--

02:13:14.893 --> 02:13:16.208
MARISHA: Nope. Great.

02:13:16.208 --> 02:13:17.483
SAM: Do you feel okay?

02:13:17.483 --> 02:13:18.018
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:13:18.018 --> 02:13:19.794
TALIESIN: Does she look okay?

02:13:19.794 --> 02:13:23.720
MATT: Make a medicine check.

02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:26.486
TALIESIN: 22.

02:13:26.486 --> 02:13:35.559
MATT: Looking at her; while all of you are fairly
warm and sweaty, her complexion is paler than you

02:13:35.559 --> 02:13:41.751
recall. There is quite a bit of sweat, more so
than expected, that is streaming down her body.

02:13:41.751 --> 02:13:47.646
Her vision appears to be not as focused and she's
not making eye contact with you as she speaks to

02:13:47.646 --> 02:13:52.196
you. Lids are a bit droopy. She doesn't look
healthy.

02:13:52.196 --> 02:13:56.298
TALIESIN: You don't look okay. Are you sure-- you
really don't look okay.

02:13:56.298 --> 02:13:57.437
MARISHA: Fuck you.

02:13:57.437 --> 02:13:58.216
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:13:58.216 --> 02:13:59.027
TALIESIN: Well.

02:13:59.027 --> 02:14:05.582
TRAVIS: There might be some leeches in this
jungle. Maybe some ticks?

02:14:05.582 --> 02:14:09.175
TALIESIN: I'm just offering something medicinal.

02:14:09.175 --> 02:14:11.309
LIAM: I'm ritual casting through this discussion.

02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:12.458
MATT: What are you casting?

02:14:12.458 --> 02:14:13.666
LIAM: Comprehend Languages.

02:14:13.666 --> 02:14:15.170
MARISHA: Do you see red stripes?

02:14:15.170 --> 02:14:15.787
TALIESIN: No.

02:14:15.787 --> 02:14:17.783
MARISHA: I feel stripey, I don't know why.

02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:19.478
TALIESIN: You're clammy and--

02:14:19.478 --> 02:14:20.772
LAURA: Should we try to--

02:14:20.772 --> 02:14:23.028
SAM and LAURA: Heal you or something?

02:14:23.028 --> 02:14:28.703
MARISHA: I'm great. I'm awesome. Are you itchy?

02:14:28.703 --> 02:14:33.256
LAURA: Okay, you haven't been around her as much,
when she tells you don't do something-- well,

02:14:33.256 --> 02:14:36.125
usually don't do it-- but okay, that's weird.

02:14:36.125 --> 02:14:39.240
SAM: Maybe it's a human thing.

02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:43.255
LAURA: She's hiding that she's actually not okay.

02:14:43.255 --> 02:14:45.099
TALIESIN: Hold on.

02:14:45.099 --> 02:14:47.466
MARISHA: (sulky) No.

02:14:47.466 --> 02:14:48.917
TALIESIN: You should take this.

02:14:48.917 --> 02:14:49.972
MARISHA: (sulkier) No.

02:14:49.972 --> 02:14:51.302
SAM: Is it tea, what is that?

02:14:51.302 --> 02:14:54.053
TRAVIS: Yeah, what is it? Give her mushrooms.

02:14:54.053 --> 02:14:59.279
TALIESIN: Take a look at this, just want to take a
look. Smell it, does it smell bad?

02:14:59.279 --> 02:15:00.640
MARISHA: Yeah, you smell bad.

02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:07.792
TALIESIN: It's a clever distraction. I'm touching
her and casting Lesser Restoration. Don't think

02:15:07.792 --> 02:15:10.100
I've never done this before.

02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:11.901
TRAVIS: Smell this. Bip.

02:15:11.901 --> 02:15:19.209
MATT: Okay. You finish casting the spell, the
energy subsides, you pull back and there's no

02:15:19.209 --> 02:15:20.428
change in her demeanor.

02:15:20.428 --> 02:15:21.457
LAURA: Oh no.

02:15:21.457 --> 02:15:23.218
MARISHA: Don't touch me.

02:15:23.218 --> 02:15:25.901
TALIESIN: I apologize. That's weird, though.

02:15:25.901 --> 02:15:28.335
LAURA: Oh I'm sorry, I was wrong: she's just a
bitch.

02:15:28.335 --> 02:15:29.845
MARISHA: I get that a lot.

02:15:29.845 --> 02:15:35.703
TALIESIN: You really don't look okay. Just for
fun, really quickly--

02:15:35.703 --> 02:15:43.468
MATT: Based on your medicine check, it looks to be
not a toxin. This is more of a disease taking hold.

02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:47.655
TALIESIN: Just out of curiosity, one check for
undead really quickly.

02:15:47.655 --> 02:15:49.663
MARISHA: I'm diseased!

02:15:49.663 --> 02:15:51.538
LAURA: Oh no, Beau.

02:15:51.538 --> 02:15:57.411
MATT: For the time being, just as a note, as this
is coming to be noticed, all of your constitution

02:15:57.411 --> 02:15:58.950
saving throws are at disadvantage.

02:15:58.950 --> 02:16:00.350
MARISHA: Oh great!

02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:02.349
TRAVIS: Did you get hit in the fight?

02:16:02.349 --> 02:16:03.155
TALIESIN: No.

02:16:03.155 --> 02:16:04.636
MARISHA: No. I just--

02:16:04.636 --> 02:16:06.770
LAURA: You must have caught something from weird
bugs.

02:16:06.770 --> 02:16:08.973
TALIESIN: Does Eyes of the Grave show anything
here?

02:16:08.973 --> 02:16:09.530
MATT: No.

02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:10.437
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:16:10.437 --> 02:16:12.577
LAURA: Oh, you got malaria!

02:16:12.577 --> 02:16:23.812
TALIESIN: All right. I did what I can. Does it
seem contagious?

02:16:23.812 --> 02:16:29.947
MATT: Not from what you can tell. You're not
entirely certain what the disease is.

02:16:29.947 --> 02:16:33.679
LAURA: Oh no, Beau! I'm just not going to stand
near you, okay?

02:16:33.679 --> 02:16:36.575
MARISHA: That's okay.

02:16:36.575 --> 02:16:45.502
MATT: It's some sort of an insect-distributed
jungle ailment.

02:16:45.502 --> 02:16:50.075
MARISHA: It's the con plague. We just got back
from New York.

02:16:50.075 --> 02:16:54.427
TALIESIN: You joke, but like a third of our people
are down. It's very empty out there.

02:16:54.427 --> 02:16:55.606
MATT: Yeah.

02:16:55.606 --> 02:16:56.763
LIAM: It's just Ed.

02:16:56.763 --> 02:16:58.671
TRAVIS: And nanny fell, too.

02:16:58.671 --> 02:17:04.401
MATT: But at least she got to watch our driver
almost beat up that guy.

02:17:04.401 --> 02:17:06.148
TRAVIS: That's true!

02:17:06.148 --> 02:17:08.344
TALIESIN: Too much for me.

02:17:08.344 --> 02:17:10.767
TRAVIS: Didn't know the Incredible Hulk was in
this motherfucker, did you?

02:17:10.767 --> 02:17:14.169
MATT: That was amazing. Anyway, back to task.

02:17:14.169 --> 02:17:20.204
TALIESIN: Yeah, just be careful what you touch for
a little while, we need--

02:17:20.204 --> 02:17:30.053
MARISHA: I'm always careful with what I touch.
I've... Let's just keep moving.

02:17:30.053 --> 02:17:36.816
MATT: As you guys slightly press forward, Jamedi
showing you a bit of a path off to the side. He

02:17:36.816 --> 02:17:42.387
glances towards the path where he was going and
one thing that catches your attention is you've

02:17:42.387 --> 02:17:49.540
seen the men with the snake arms, you've seen the
folk with the scaled skin patches. What you see

02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:57.314
now, towards this one stairway portion that now
leads to what you previously didn't see below the

02:17:57.314 --> 02:18:03.735
tree line, but a massive stone structure beset by
these stairs on each of its five sides. Envision

02:18:03.735 --> 02:18:11.589
like a semblance of an Aztec pyramid, but a
five-side shape that levels off at the top and

02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:20.046
there are stairs on each of these five sides. At
the base of the nearest one, you see less of a man

02:18:20.046 --> 02:18:27.020
and more of a giant snake, maybe twelve to fifteen
feet long, coiled and muscular. But to a humanoid

02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:35.761
torso with two heavy log-like arms that rest at
its sides. One resting on this large sheathed

02:18:35.761 --> 02:18:42.879
scimitar-like blade, its head curled up into this
heavy, straight serpent snake-like mouth as its

02:18:42.879 --> 02:18:47.828
jaw kind of hangs open and its tongue (hissing
noise). It's just keeping an eye and it slithers

02:18:47.828 --> 02:18:52.858
across the road, bowing from side to side as it
looks across the tree line.

02:18:52.858 --> 02:18:54.693
TRAVIS: At the base of the structure it's doing
that?

02:18:54.693 --> 02:18:59.909
MATT: The base of the structure. You're seeing a
variety of these snake people going about their

02:19:00.181 --> 02:19:06.049
lives. This one is just keeping a watch in that
one element and Jamedi you can hear curse under

02:19:06.049 --> 02:19:18.864
his breath. "It was the path I took to the inside
last time. We're going to have to improvise. Which

02:19:18.864 --> 02:19:20.403
"way do you want to go?"

02:19:20.403 --> 02:19:24.663
SAM: We're trying to get into the center of this,
all of this?

02:19:24.663 --> 02:19:28.064
MATT: Avantika's like, "Of course, inside that big
thing right there."

02:19:28.064 --> 02:19:38.830
TRAVIS: Okay, so if-- I'll go over to Jamedi. If
we can clear him, is the path you've taken before

02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:42.056
clear as far as you can see. I don't know which
way you went?

02:19:42.056 --> 02:19:48.536
MATT: "As far as I can remember it was fairly
clear but it is also-- I had to ensure that there

02:19:48.536 --> 02:19:52.806
"was not many watching. They have these-- like
right there." He points over the side and you can

02:19:52.806 --> 02:20:00.175
see along the stairs almost like
a withered person. You see them, like a smaller

02:20:00.175 --> 02:20:07.537
human, hunched forward, their body a light green
tint to itself, kind of this wrinkled, scaled

02:20:07.537 --> 02:20:13.466
body, its neck protruding and curved outward. It
looks what a-- like the lizard folk you had seen

02:20:13.466 --> 02:20:17.625
earlier but with a longer neck and almost
geriatric in the way they carry themselves

02:20:17.625 --> 02:20:23.474
forward, lumbering. Carrying a large spear and
appears to be watching like a sentinel across the

02:20:23.474 --> 02:20:26.591
upper portion of this large stone structure.

02:20:26.591 --> 02:20:31.451
LAURA: So it's got a lizard face? Not like a human
face with a really long neck?

02:20:31.451 --> 02:20:35.916
MATT: From what you can tell from this distance,
it's hard to see but it looks to be more serpent

02:20:36.167 --> 02:20:37.374
and more snake-like.

02:20:37.374 --> 02:20:41.109
LAURA: Like the Beetlejuice part where his head
goes--

02:20:41.109 --> 02:20:47.671
TRAVIS: Can anyone create a distraction that
doesn't put their own person at risk?

02:20:47.671 --> 02:20:49.073
SAM: Sure.

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:50.114
MARISHA: Jester.

02:20:51.065 --> 02:20:56.976
MATT: And you can see there's about four or so
buildings between where you are and the base of

02:20:56.976 --> 02:21:03.649
the structure. There's a small village that
surrounds the base of this temple. And so you guys

02:21:03.649 --> 02:21:06.524
have to find your way through this city.

02:21:06.524 --> 02:21:09.673
LAURA: This city without being seen? There's a big
group of us.

02:21:09.673 --> 02:21:11.850
TRAVIS: It's not us, clearing, and then the
building. There's stuff.

02:21:11.850 --> 02:21:14.092
LAURA: Can we make ourselves look like the snake
people?

02:21:14.092 --> 02:21:15.635
SAM: Sure! Some us can.

02:21:15.635 --> 02:21:17.074
MARISHA: I can't.

02:21:17.074 --> 02:21:20.818
TRAVIS: Although we could throw you in a net and
act like you were dinner.

02:21:20.818 --> 02:21:22.820
SAM: Yes, yes.

02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:23.832
MARISHA: Okay.

02:21:23.832 --> 02:21:26.180
LAURA: What's wrong with that?

02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:27.568
TRAVIS: Who's got a net?

02:21:27.568 --> 02:21:31.016
LAURA: Hey you two, can you make yourself look
like snake people?

02:21:31.016 --> 02:21:42.000
MATT: Avantika goes, "Uh, that is not really a
specialty of mine. However, I'm very good at not

02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:48.239
"being seen." And Jamedi goes, "It's also my
specialty. Perhaps we can come from a different

02:21:48.239 --> 02:21:51.415
"direction, smaller group. The two of us can meet
on the way."

02:21:51.415 --> 02:21:53.792
MARISHA: You know what, maybe I could go with
them.

02:21:53.792 --> 02:21:57.648
LIAM: I did not prepare the spell to disguise
myself. I thought we would be fighting monster

02:21:57.648 --> 02:21:59.325
people, so...

02:21:59.325 --> 02:22:02.642
MARISHA: Such a bitch. Sucks.

02:22:02.642 --> 02:22:03.456
LIAM: What?

02:22:03.456 --> 02:22:06.354
MARISHA: Saying that as a person. I'm just
commiserating. Moving on.

02:22:06.354 --> 02:22:07.608
LIAM: Are you Marisha or--

02:22:07.608 --> 02:22:16.871
MARISHA: I was, yeah. How about I go with these
guys, with Jamedi and Avantika?

02:22:16.871 --> 02:22:22.674
MATT: They both look at you and say, "The whole
point of this was to make it a small group. The

02:22:22.674 --> 02:22:25.240
"more we add to this group, the harder it is for us
to do this."

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:26.742
MARISHA: Three is a small group.

02:22:26.742 --> 02:22:28.135
LAURA: Can you be invisible?

02:22:28.135 --> 02:22:30.903
TRAVIS: How many of us can change? One, two,
three, four.

02:22:30.903 --> 02:22:32.660
SAM: But not these two.

02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:36.107
TRAVIS: Awesome, great. Two of us, one each take,
tie them up in rope--

02:22:36.107 --> 02:22:40.747
SAM: As prisoners. They're humans, they're
disgusting, filthy pink skins.

02:22:40.747 --> 02:22:42.939
LAURA: But still we move really stealthily.

02:22:42.939 --> 02:22:44.060
SAM: Oh wait, Yasha.

02:22:44.060 --> 02:22:51.160
MATT: Yasha's just sitting there with her arms
crossed just listening to the whole conversation going--

02:22:51.462 --> 02:22:53.201
SAM: Can you change your appearance?

02:22:53.201 --> 02:22:57.698
MATT: "I mean, kind of."

02:22:57.698 --> 02:22:59.540
TRAVIS: Kind of?

02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:01.640
LAURA: I don't think she can do it like we think.

02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:03.654
MATT: "Like, the wings?"

02:23:03.654 --> 02:23:06.395
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's less of what we're looking
for.

02:23:06.395 --> 02:23:11.549
SAM: We could make a distraction. Some of us can
snakey.

02:23:11.549 --> 02:23:17.102
LAURA: Maybe we do separate into smaller groups
and try to stealth it.

02:23:17.102 --> 02:23:21.906
SAM: The ones who can't change can go first and
we'll make a distraction and then the ones who can

02:23:21.906 --> 02:23:25.290
can just walk in after.

02:23:25.290 --> 02:23:27.011
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:23:27.011 --> 02:23:29.300
LAURA: Oh my god, okay.

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.690
LIAM: Comforting.

02:23:31.690 --> 02:23:36.845
SAM: You'll have Yasha with you. And Beau to
protect you.

02:23:36.845 --> 02:23:41.316
TALIESIN: But without you, they're not going to be
as sneaky. We have to stay together if we're going

02:23:41.316 --> 02:23:42.915
to want to be super stealthy.

02:23:42.915 --> 02:23:44.590
LAURA: That's a really good point.

02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:47.806
TALIESIN: Together probably is better.

02:23:47.806 --> 02:23:51.778
SAM: They won't have to be sneaky if we make
enough of a distraction, right?

02:23:51.778 --> 02:23:55.592
LAURA: What if we don't make a distraction. We
make them look like prisoners, we still try to be

02:23:55.592 --> 02:23:59.818
sneaky, but then if we're caught, then we have an
excuse.

02:23:59.818 --> 02:24:04.307
SAM: All right. All in favor of that plan?

02:24:04.307 --> 02:24:05.669
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:24:05.669 --> 02:24:07.914
SAM: That's one vote.

02:24:07.914 --> 02:24:08.605
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:24:08.605 --> 02:24:15.282
LIAM: What do we think that these beings' reaction
will be to not lizard-people being on this island

02:24:15.282 --> 02:24:16.795
all of a sudden?

02:24:16.795 --> 02:24:18.834
TALIESIN: Or for that matter, if we can't speak to
them?

02:24:18.834 --> 02:24:20.590
LAURA: I think they will probably try to--

02:24:20.590 --> 02:24:24.518
LIAM: You think it's an every day or every week or
month occurrence? I think we're probably pretty

02:24:24.518 --> 02:24:25.858
special here.

02:24:25.858 --> 02:24:30.503
LAURA: I think they might try to kill us and then
eat us like that guy over there.

02:24:30.503 --> 02:24:34.355
TRAVIS: I think we should try and be as sneaky as
possible. If for some reason shit hits the fan, I

02:24:34.355 --> 02:24:42.010
can make a pretty, I think, spectacular
distraction that doesn't put me or us at risk. But

02:24:42.010 --> 02:24:44.190
I think we should try stealth first.

02:24:44.190 --> 02:24:46.718
TALIESIN: Stealth with a couple emergency back-up
snake looking people.

02:24:46.718 --> 02:24:49.196
TRAVIS: Stealth, distraction, fuck shit up. Cool?

02:24:49.196 --> 02:24:50.102
MARISHA: Okay, so--

02:24:50.102 --> 02:24:52.471
SAM: Can you make a distraction far away from us?

02:24:52.471 --> 02:24:52.998
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:24:52.998 --> 02:24:59.155
MARISHA: If Caleb and I move together, you have
your Message spell that you can send back and

02:24:59.155 --> 02:25:00.760
forth to Nott.

02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:04.260
TALIESIN: We all have to move together.

02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:06.643
MARISHA: Oh, that's what we're doing?

02:25:06.643 --> 02:25:11.213
LAURA: Well you guys aren't as stealthy without
being within 30 feet of me--

02:25:11.213 --> 02:25:13.463
SAM: Oh boy.

02:25:13.463 --> 02:25:17.871
MARISHA: Maybe we do the live bait thing, I don't
know.

02:25:18.345 --> 02:25:19.395
TRAVIS: What, act like you're tied up?

02:25:19.395 --> 02:25:20.139
MARISHA: Maybe.

02:25:20.139 --> 02:25:20.894
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll do it anyway.

02:25:20.894 --> 02:25:22.191
TALIESIN: That's if they see us.

02:25:22.191 --> 02:25:23.069
TRAVIS: We'll tie your hands in the front.

02:25:23.069 --> 02:25:24.745
TALIESIN: If they don't see us, it doesn't matter
what they look like.

02:25:24.745 --> 02:25:26.048
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:25:26.048 --> 02:25:29.853
LIAM: I think that if anyone that looks like me or
you shows up on this island, anyone who sees it

02:25:29.853 --> 02:25:32.986
is going to come asking questions immediately.

02:25:32.986 --> 02:25:33.844
TRAVIS: I agree.

02:25:33.844 --> 02:25:37.182
LAURA: What if-- do any of the people we see
walking around, do any of them wear cloaks?

02:25:37.182 --> 02:25:40.183
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:25:40.183 --> 02:25:42.608
TRAVIS: That's not a bad thought.

02:25:45.278 --> 02:25:46.428
LAURA: 14.

02:25:46.428 --> 02:25:49.947
MATT: Looking around, you don't see many cloaks.
The weather here is warm enough to the point where

02:25:50.297 --> 02:25:54.545
there isn't the need to bundle. There's no need
for hoods because the society here wants to make

02:25:54.545 --> 02:25:59.137
sure they can very quickly identify who's a part
of their faction and who isn't. So yeah, there's

02:25:59.137 --> 02:26:07.386
no cloaks. You see what are like open robes,
simple bits of cloth just to cover aspects of the

02:26:07.386 --> 02:26:12.377
body for protection from the sun or otherwise, but
beyond that it's mostly just skin and scales.

02:26:12.377 --> 02:26:15.381
LAURA: But there are some people that look just
like people?

02:26:15.381 --> 02:26:18.546
MATT: There are people that look mostly like
people from a distance, but upon closer look,

02:26:18.546 --> 02:26:24.224
their skin in places that gets a greener hue in
patches, their eyes are yellow. Very snake-like

02:26:24.224 --> 02:26:26.276
eyes. Sharper teeth.

02:26:26.276 --> 02:26:31.950
LAURA: I will use my disguise kit and try to make
it look like they've got scales on them. They will

02:26:31.950 --> 02:26:35.455
probably know the people in their own fucking
village, though. Let's be honest.

02:26:35.455 --> 02:26:37.806
TRAVIS: Are there several dozen people, or is
it--

02:26:37.806 --> 02:26:42.980
MATT: Now that you've watched, the first view you
had was only the first few buildings in front of

02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:48.645
you. Now that you've stepped forward and glanced,
you can see there's maybe about 30 to 40 buildings

02:26:48.645 --> 02:26:56.753
that sit around the base of this entire temple.
You've seen a few dozen in the streets, so the

02:26:56.753 --> 02:27:02.768
society here, you can assume somewhere in the
neighborhood of like one to three hundred people

02:27:02.768 --> 02:27:03.937
live in the city total.

02:27:03.937 --> 02:27:05.005
TRAVIS: Let's do that, yeah.

02:27:05.005 --> 02:27:05.944
MARISHA: That's a lot of people.

02:27:05.944 --> 02:27:11.202
TRAVIS: I'll use Mask of Many Faces to look like
one of those fucks and let's try to paint some

02:27:11.202 --> 02:27:13.381
scales on the non-changeling folks.

02:27:13.381 --> 02:27:17.776
LAURA: (makes blipping noises)

02:27:17.776 --> 02:27:21.672
MATT: Okay, so you're applying them to Yasha and
Beau and Caleb?

02:27:21.672 --> 02:27:26.494
LIAM: And the clothes we've seen on these people
are like what? They're purple robes you've mentioned?

02:27:27.231 --> 02:27:35.753
MATT: Purple robes, simple cloth skirts. Most of
the whole thing that's worn there is for general

02:27:35.753 --> 02:27:42.428
protection and adornment. You can see jewelry
adorning some of them, but it's very simple and

02:27:42.428 --> 02:27:46.246
it's more for purpose than anything extravagant or
presentational.

02:27:46.246 --> 02:27:56.951
LIAM: (groaning) I begin to put-- ugh-- my spell
books into Fjord's bag.

02:27:56.951 --> 02:27:58.592
TRAVIS: Of Holding?

02:27:58.592 --> 02:28:08.355
LIAM: Yeah, I can't have ornate book holsters
and-- ugh. Trying to make myself look as simple as possible.

02:28:10.336 --> 02:28:11.886
LAURA: Disguise Self!

02:28:11.886 --> 02:28:17.638
MATT: Avantika goes, "I'll be watching. Au
revoir." And she kind of--

02:28:17.638 --> 02:28:21.412
TRAVIS: Where are you going? Where are we meeting?
At the temple? At the top?

02:28:21.412 --> 02:28:26.042
MATT: "I figure the top of that would be a very
effective place to meet. Is that not correct? That

02:28:26.042 --> 02:28:31.229
is where you entered last time, non?" She turns
to Jamedi, who's keeping low to the ground and

02:28:31.229 --> 02:28:36.988
goes, "That is indeed where I was. There is a room
inside there I could not walk into. I could not

02:28:36.988 --> 02:28:45.684
find a way through. That is when I returned. So
we'll meet there." Avantika goes "Au revoir."

02:28:45.684 --> 02:28:50.060
Waves her hand through the air, and marks a few
symbols and you watch as she disappears.

02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:52.412
LIAM: I had that spell once.

02:28:52.412 --> 02:28:58.262
SAM: Are these guys painted green? Is that what
we're doing?

02:28:58.262 --> 02:29:04.864
MATT: That's what we're going to find out right
now! You're proficient with your disguise kit, so

02:29:04.864 --> 02:29:12.834
it's proficiency bonus plus I'll say dexterity
check to see how well you can apply these details

02:29:12.834 --> 02:29:15.195
to their bodies. Roll for each one of them.

02:29:15.195 --> 02:29:16.870
LIAM: I'll look like a 1980s Halloween costume.
Come on.

02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:17.517
MATT: For Caleb?

02:29:17.517 --> 02:29:20.237
MARISHA: State fair, all the way.

02:29:20.237 --> 02:29:23.057
LIAM: Make me look like Spiderman.

02:29:23.057 --> 02:29:24.905
LAURA: Eight.

02:29:24.905 --> 02:29:35.767
MATT: Caleb has these green circles on his face in
splotches. And you're like, "Great!" For Beau?

02:29:35.767 --> 02:29:39.675
LAURA: Okay, that's way better. 17.

02:29:39.675 --> 02:29:44.684
MATT: Beau, actually, pretty good job; the
linework and shading you had done in these various

02:29:44.684 --> 02:29:49.290
patches on the inside of the brow line helps make
her look a little more snakelike. You've sunken

02:29:49.290 --> 02:29:53.418
the jowls, you've done the scattered patches with
the patchmarks.

02:29:53.418 --> 02:29:58.720
LIAM: You look pretty convincing. How do I look?

02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:01.286
MARISHA: Polio?

02:30:01.286 --> 02:30:05.904
LAURA: Now that I'm seeing how good I did on Beau,
I'm realizing how shitty Caleb is, but I'm not

02:30:05.904 --> 02:30:06.945
going to tell him.

02:30:06.945 --> 02:30:08.595
LIAM: What do you mean-- what did you say?

02:30:08.595 --> 02:30:12.444
MATT: Yasha seems strangely excited. "Me next, me
next."

02:30:12.444 --> 02:30:14.440
LAURA: Okay, okay. Oh.

02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:22.468
TRAVIS: Is that a one? Shit. God-- why did you
roll out that big fucker?

02:30:22.468 --> 02:30:24.244
SAM: It was good before!

02:30:24.244 --> 02:30:26.304
LAURA: This one's from Sam!

02:30:29.784 --> 02:30:37.798
MATT: You guys look amongst yourselves while she's
working on Yasha, and finally she finishes, and

02:30:38.050 --> 02:30:50.840
voila! Pulls back, and it's just Grinch. Just
green, head to toe. Bright green. It's pretty bad.

02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:52.562
But you feel pretty confident about it.

02:30:52.562 --> 02:30:55.741
LAURA: You look amazing. It's a really good color
on you.

02:30:55.741 --> 02:30:58.917
MATT: Yasha goes, "Okay. Let's do this."

02:30:58.917 --> 02:31:05.697
SAM: I'm going to grab Caleb and be like: You're
going to be fine out there. It's going to be fine.

02:31:05.697 --> 02:31:08.240
Just think like a lizard, right?

02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:10.448
LAURA: What do you mean she looks bad? I think she
looks really good, Caleb.

02:31:10.448 --> 02:31:15.231
SAM: I'm going to take some flowers and just stick
one in his hair for good luck.

02:31:15.231 --> 02:31:16.467
LIAM: Is that better?

02:31:16.467 --> 02:31:18.576
SAM: I don't know. It's good luck, though!

02:31:18.576 --> 02:31:23.115
LIAM: I lean in, way in, to Nott's ear, and say:
(whispering) Oh, by the way, Caduceus says that

02:31:23.115 --> 02:31:25.581
Jamedi is actually a dead thing.

02:31:25.581 --> 02:31:37.273
SAM: What?! What?! No, but what? Shit! Why are
we following him, then?!

02:31:37.273 --> 02:31:41.876
MARISHA: I lean in and say, Are we whispering
now? We whispering again?

02:31:41.876 --> 02:31:43.216
SAM: No, they're gone!

02:31:43.216 --> 02:31:49.785
LIAM: (whispering) I was telling Nott that Jamedi
is a dead thing. Caduceus says Jamedi's dead.

02:31:49.785 --> 02:31:50.476
MARISHA: What?

02:31:50.476 --> 02:31:53.287
LIAM: (whispering) Keep it on the DL.

02:31:53.287 --> 02:31:54.808
MARISHA: The dead-low?

02:31:54.808 --> 02:31:57.000
SAM: Why are we following him?

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.871
LAURA: Just because he's dead doesn't mean he's a
bad guy.

02:31:59.871 --> 02:32:01.162
LIAM: (whispering) Are you whispering too?

02:32:01.162 --> 02:32:02.049
LAURA: Yes, of course I am!

02:32:02.049 --> 02:32:03.253
LIAM: (whispering) We don't have a choice!

02:32:03.253 --> 02:32:09.745
SAM: What if he came here, was killed, and was
sent to come get us to bring us back as feeding

02:32:09.745 --> 02:32:11.330
for whatever's down there?

02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:15.547
LIAM: (whispering) What if we let the pirate queen
tie rocks to our feet and we're dead?! We have to

02:32:15.547 --> 02:32:17.537
do this! We can kill them later!

02:32:17.537 --> 02:32:19.101
TRAVIS: Agreed.

02:32:19.101 --> 02:32:20.523
MATT: "Agreed."

02:32:20.523 --> 02:32:24.368
SAM: Ah! You're still here?! Shit!

02:32:24.368 --> 02:32:27.426
MATT: "Well, I hadn't left yet. I was curious to
see your--"

02:32:27.426 --> 02:32:29.166
SAM: Did you know? Where are you?

02:32:29.166 --> 02:32:31.636
MATT: You don't see, the voice is coming from
nowhere.

02:32:31.636 --> 02:32:34.157
SAM: Is Jamedi here?

02:32:34.157 --> 02:32:36.100
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:32:36.100 --> 02:32:38.676
SAM: 18.

02:32:38.676 --> 02:32:41.934
MATT: Looking around, you do not see Jamedi
immediately in the vicinity.

02:32:41.934 --> 02:32:43.504
MARISHA: Is he on speakerphone?

02:32:43.504 --> 02:32:44.930
MATT: No, this is Avantika.

02:32:44.930 --> 02:32:48.219
SAM: Avantika! Did you know he was dead?

02:32:48.219 --> 02:32:52.241
TALIESIN: Specifically he was not telling you,
because I knew you were going to panic.

02:32:52.241 --> 02:32:53.783
SAM: Did you know he was a dead guy?

02:32:53.783 --> 02:32:58.374
MATT: "I was not aware, but now I am very curious
as to where you found this information and what

02:32:58.374 --> 02:33:00.245
"you think this means."

02:33:00.245 --> 02:33:05.469
TALIESIN: I just know things. I don't know what it
means. I was trying to find a moment to figure out

02:33:05.469 --> 02:33:11.687
if you knew, or if we should tell you, or if this
was part of some sort of plan. I hadn't figured it

02:33:11.687 --> 02:33:20.983
out, and for some reason, I had not realized that
I was walking around with a bunch of gossips.

02:33:20.983 --> 02:33:28.320
Well, it's what I get, I suppose, for trying to be
sneaky about things.

02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:32.936
TRAVIS: Nice job. He's going to fucking leave
again. Good job.

02:33:32.936 --> 02:33:34.611
MARISHA: Whose side are you on?

02:33:34.611 --> 02:33:42.705
TALIESIN: I've been doing my best not to be thrown
by it. It seems like he's been standing up all right.

02:33:42.829 --> 02:33:45.377
MATT: "He's done work for me before, and was
successful."

02:33:45.377 --> 02:33:46.715
LAURA: He's pretty cool.

02:33:46.715 --> 02:33:50.797
SAM: Has he always been dead? Is this a recent
thing? Where are you?

02:33:50.797 --> 02:33:56.416
MATT: "Don't worry about it. But nevertheless, he
has done his job so far. I assume we just keep a

02:33:56.416 --> 02:34:03.586
"close eye. If ever he decides to give any sign of
turning on any of us, well, it's eight against one."

02:34:03.586 --> 02:34:07.669
TRAVIS: Indeed. I'll take out several feet of rope
from the bag of holding and say: We should do this

02:34:07.669 --> 02:34:10.806
before he achieves the destination. Forward.

02:34:10.854 --> 02:34:14.594
MATT: "See you on the other side." And you watch
as the dust-- (puffing) the footprints.

02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:19.783
TALIESIN: This is why I was trying to keep it on
the down-low.

02:34:19.783 --> 02:34:21.540
SAM: Why?

02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:27.320
TALIESIN: I knew that certain members of the party
may get a little excited. I, myself, had a moment

02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:33.922
of panic. Had a moment of panic myself. I've been
keeping it contained.

02:34:33.922 --> 02:34:35.305
LAURA: You feel okay now?

02:34:35.305 --> 02:34:40.491
TALIESIN: No, there's a dead guy walking around
with us. That's unsettling. That's unsettling to

02:34:40.491 --> 02:34:45.792
my very core, I've got to admit, but you know.

02:34:45.792 --> 02:34:49.864
LAURA: Well, now we just have to go walk around
snake people and not be seen, so that's fine.

02:34:49.864 --> 02:34:51.628
TALIESIN: It's an improvement, at the very least.

02:34:51.628 --> 02:34:58.779
MARISHA: Hey, Fjord. Avantika can go invisible or
peek into what we're saying. Can you do that?

02:34:58.779 --> 02:35:06.610
TRAVIS: No. Well, kind of. Not really. No.

02:35:06.610 --> 02:35:08.070
MARISHA: How much have you heard?

02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:09.916
TRAVIS: I mean, I can pop in and out, but--

02:35:09.916 --> 02:35:11.604
LIAM: We've seen you flit about.

02:35:11.604 --> 02:35:12.503
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one.

02:35:12.503 --> 02:35:14.867
LAURA: But you can't hear what's on the other side
when you're popping in and out, can you? Oh, yes

02:35:14.867 --> 02:35:17.076
you can! That's right, you can.

02:35:17.076 --> 02:35:19.235
TALIESIN: How many fingers am I holding up?

02:35:19.235 --> 02:35:21.921
TRAVIS: None.

02:35:21.921 --> 02:35:28.817
TALIESIN: Oh. I forgot to-- I'm really distracted
right now. I don't know why I bother.

02:35:28.817 --> 02:35:32.796
LAURA: We should probably get pretty snaking on
here.

02:35:32.796 --> 02:35:41.957
TRAVIS: We'll put two in the front, two in the
back, and put these three in the--

02:35:41.957 --> 02:35:44.584
LAURA: In the middle.

02:35:44.584 --> 02:35:48.338
MATT: Your Pass Without a Trace has probably faded
at this point, with the travel you've made so you

02:35:48.338 --> 02:35:50.874
have to recast it to get the spell bonus.

02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:52.308
LAURA: You guys, we should probably do it again?

02:35:52.308 --> 02:35:53.107
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:35:53.107 --> 02:35:53.834
LIAM: Yeah.

02:35:53.834 --> 02:35:58.387
LAURA: (singing) Pass pass pass pa-pass. I give
Yasha the Blessing of the Trickster.

02:35:58.387 --> 02:36:00.132
TRAVIS: Good call.

02:36:00.132 --> 02:36:02.493
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check, please.

02:36:02.493 --> 02:36:13.496
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on, real quick: (clearing
throat) Real talk, for just a second. If Yasha

02:36:13.496 --> 02:36:18.537
comes with us, and we puppet her, and she dies,
Ashley's going to be real mad. Just pointing this

02:36:18.537 --> 02:36:23.352
out last time, because we did this with Pike. Not
saying one way or the other! Just saying, we're

02:36:23.352 --> 02:36:30.150
going to continue on with Yasha? Okay. Done. Done.
That's all I'm going to say.

02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:33.623
SAM: She's going to be in a defensive stance for
most of the fight.

02:36:33.623 --> 02:36:35.981
TRAVIS: She'll be fine. I'll pilot her.

02:36:35.981 --> 02:36:41.392
LAURA: I would say let's text her, but she's in
another country, so she probably wouldn't get it.

02:36:41.392 --> 02:36:44.182
MATT: Stealth checks, guys.

02:36:44.182 --> 02:36:45.429
TRAVIS: 21.

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:46.601
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:36:46.601 --> 02:36:48.262
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace.

02:36:48.262 --> 02:36:49.514
MARISHA: 20.

02:36:49.514 --> 02:36:50.767
LIAM: 25.

02:36:50.767 --> 02:36:56.489
SAM: Oh, I get advantage. 30. No! 38.

02:36:56.489 --> 02:36:59.314
LIAM: Rogues, man, rogues!

02:36:59.314 --> 02:37:02.368
TRAVIS: What? Natural one?

02:37:06.448 --> 02:37:07.367
TALIESIN: 26.

02:37:07.412 --> 02:37:09.162
SAM: She's a lizard person; she'll be fine.

02:37:09.162 --> 02:37:11.278
MATT: And for Yasha, if you want to roll twice?

02:37:11.278 --> 02:37:16.150
TRAVIS: 25. Natural 15.

02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:20.899
LAURA: At least I look like a snake person.

02:37:20.899 --> 02:37:23.803
SAM: You're going to be a loud snake person.
That's fine.

02:37:23.803 --> 02:37:30.747
MATT: You all begin to make your way towards the
first set of buildings. There's that one

02:37:30.747 --> 02:37:35.904
individual that's flaying the bodies of the
lizardmen. Has made their way through two of them.

02:37:35.904 --> 02:37:41.560
There are two more that are in the process of
being stripped. There is one street that breaks

02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:47.895
through two of the ones closest to you. Do you
wish to take that path? What do you wish to do to

02:37:47.895 --> 02:37:54.059
stealth in? Because part of the pathway here is
out in the open, so you'd have to gauge your timing.

02:37:54.059 --> 02:37:56.216
TRAVIS: Describe the two again?

02:37:56.216 --> 02:38:01.652
MATT: Where you are now, towards the main stairway
that leads at the top, you have about two streets

02:38:01.652 --> 02:38:06.084
or three sets of buildings to get through. The
ones closest to you, there are two large buildings

02:38:06.084 --> 02:38:11.002
that are immediately towards your side. One side
has nobody around it. The other one has one

02:38:11.002 --> 02:38:16.010
individual that is currently flaying the hanging
corpses of the four lizardmen.

02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:19.570
TRAVIS: I vote for the one guy flaying the
lizardmen.

02:38:19.570 --> 02:38:20.812
MARISHA: Agreed.

02:38:20.812 --> 02:38:21.839
LAURA: Because he's distracted?

02:38:21.839 --> 02:38:24.367
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. And it's one guy.

02:38:24.367 --> 02:38:25.528
LAURA: The other one has no guys.

02:38:25.528 --> 02:38:27.873
TRAVIS: That never is no guys.

02:38:27.873 --> 02:38:32.897
LAURA: Okay. I follow your lead, captain.

02:38:32.897 --> 02:38:35.445
TRAVIS: Let's go that way. We'll go towards the
flaying.

02:38:35.445 --> 02:38:46.207
MATT: Okay. You make your way, exiting the jungle
way, and are you going quickly and quietly so

02:38:46.207 --> 02:38:50.901
nobody notices or are you strolling through, using
your stealth as a means of trying to keep any sort of--

02:38:50.901 --> 02:38:52.301
TRAVIS: Trying to blend in.

02:38:52.301 --> 02:38:59.606
MATT: Got you. Okay. All of you move forward. Are
you dragging them behind by ropes?

02:38:59.606 --> 02:39:03.873
MARISHA: No, we're in the middle. We're Assassin's
Creeding it.

02:39:03.873 --> 02:39:05.012
MATT: Got you.

02:39:05.012 --> 02:39:09.308
TRAVIS: If there is a building to walk beside, I
would prefer to have our shittily drawn and one

02:39:09.308 --> 02:39:12.503
very nice one closest to the building with us on
the outside.

02:39:12.503 --> 02:39:15.859
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Yeah, I'll be the barrier.

02:39:15.859 --> 02:39:18.293
TRAVIS: Mama elephants and then baby elephants.

02:39:18.293 --> 02:39:20.597
MARISHA: Aww, yeah!

02:39:20.597 --> 02:39:27.570
MATT: You guys cluster and begin to shift as this
herd of snakefolk making your way towards that direction.

02:39:27.570 --> 02:39:31.557
TRAVIS: Oh god, oh god, oh god.

02:39:31.557 --> 02:39:38.305
MATT: As the light hits you as you leave the
branches of the jungle and begin shifting, fully

02:39:38.305 --> 02:39:43.316
open now in the middle of the midday sun,
immediately you feel the heat on the back of your

02:39:43.316 --> 02:39:49.736
neck and shoulders begin to grow hotter and hotter
as the nerves build up inside. You cruise through

02:39:49.736 --> 02:39:57.275
the open area, and to the left you hear a (whip
cracking). You glance over and you can see another

02:39:57.275 --> 02:40:04.574
one of those massive, mostly-snake, serpentine
hulking individuals is currently wielding a whip.

02:40:04.574 --> 02:40:11.388
There is a cluster of lizardmen that are currently
chained and are currently pushing on a heavy bar

02:40:11.388 --> 02:40:15.804
that is dragging a large piece of stone out of the
jungle and towards the center of the city. They're

02:40:15.804 --> 02:40:21.638
bent into slave labor for these people. They are
now pushing it forward. That catches you off guard

02:40:21.638 --> 02:40:25.570
for a minute, but you continue to focus and move
forward. As you get closer, you can hear the slick

02:40:25.570 --> 02:40:30.561
sound of the flesh being pulled from the back of
the lizardman's body-- (wet ripping)

02:40:30.561 --> 02:40:34.134
TRAVIS: Aww, yeah!

02:40:36.832 --> 02:40:47.052
MATT: Onto the side-- (coughing) Had me a little
bit of spittle on that one. (coughing) Pardon me.

02:40:47.052 --> 02:40:51.754
Moving around the side, the figure finishes and
throws it, and glances over and looks at your

02:40:51.754 --> 02:41:00.265
group. Starts looking somewhat curiously as you
pass.

02:41:00.265 --> 02:41:04.972
SAM and LAURA: (hissing)

02:41:04.972 --> 02:41:07.408
MATT: Make a deception check, Jester.

02:41:07.408 --> 02:41:10.428
LAURA and TRAVIS: Why?

02:41:10.428 --> 02:41:15.937
LAURA: Because I rolled a shitty stealth, that's
why. Oh no.

02:41:15.937 --> 02:41:19.288
MATT: Yasha's going to make a deception check as
well.

02:41:19.288 --> 02:41:24.218
LAURA: (gasp) Natural 20!

02:41:24.218 --> 02:41:33.649
MATT: All right. Yasha rolled pretty high on that,
actually. The figure goes back to its work and

02:41:33.649 --> 02:41:39.133
begins carving it. You move past that into the
first street walkway. It moves on for about

02:41:39.133 --> 02:41:44.162
fifteen or so feet and then it has a crosspath. It
goes to the right and the left, and ahead it goes

02:41:44.162 --> 02:41:47.881
to another set of buildings behind, and there is
an alley that turns to the right and it seems to

02:41:47.881 --> 02:41:53.190
end at that point. So you have a T intersection
before you, and then it ends and curves to the

02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:55.290
right. Where do you go?

02:41:55.290 --> 02:41:57.878
LIAM: So an intersection to go through to get to
the right turn past it?

02:41:57.878 --> 02:42:00.278
MARISHA: I see. So it's like a cross-T
intersection?

02:42:00.278 --> 02:42:03.354
MATT: Right. You keep moving and then there's a
right and left, or you keep moving and then it

02:42:03.354 --> 02:42:04.675
turns to the right.

02:42:04.675 --> 02:42:06.937
TRAVIS: Are there any windows, doors, anything on
these buildings?

02:42:06.937 --> 02:42:13.535
MATT: You see open squares. There's no glass
panes, but there are carved rectangles removed.

02:42:13.535 --> 02:42:17.175
TRAVIS: Can we move up to the side of one and
glance in as we slow down just a little bit to

02:42:17.175 --> 02:42:18.880
peek through?

02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:20.368
MARISHA: On this T intersection?

02:42:20.368 --> 02:42:22.940
TRAVIS: No, before we get to the intersection.

02:42:22.940 --> 02:42:28.587
LAURA: Just to be clear: I always thought that a T
intersection was an intersection like this.

02:42:28.587 --> 02:42:32.074
MATT, TRAVIS and MARISHA: Four-way stop.

02:42:32.074 --> 02:42:38.071
MATT: That's my fault. It's a lower-case t!
Lower-case t.

02:42:38.071 --> 02:42:40.314
LAURA: No, no, no, I get it. I just wanted to make
sure.

02:42:40.314 --> 02:42:41.603
MATT: Sorry, I meant a cross intersection.

02:42:41.603 --> 02:42:43.538
LIAM: Don't you listen to her.

02:42:43.538 --> 02:42:47.965
MATT: No, it's fine. It's an important
clarification. That's my brain fart, man. I

02:42:47.965 --> 02:42:50.175
appreciate the backup. But yeah, you're right on
that.

02:42:50.175 --> 02:42:50.853
LAURA: Okay.

02:42:50.853 --> 02:42:56.069
MARISHA: Okay, guru Liam. Yeah. Liam from Ojai.

02:42:56.069 --> 02:42:57.375
MATT: Namaste.

02:42:57.375 --> 02:43:00.467
LIAM: I'm going to go listen to your tapes, your
level seven tapes.

02:43:00.467 --> 02:43:04.666
TALIESIN: A most expeditious movement towards the
temple, I suppose, would be the--

02:43:04.666 --> 02:43:05.977
TRAVIS: Do we look in the window?

02:43:05.977 --> 02:43:09.964
MATT: As he's saying this, you glance to the
window to your left, and as you look in, make a

02:43:09.964 --> 02:43:11.102
perception check.

02:43:11.102 --> 02:43:12.615
LAURA: Ooh!

02:43:12.615 --> 02:43:15.965
TRAVIS: Ugh, seven.

02:43:15.965 --> 02:43:18.577
MATT: You glance inside, and it's a simple
interior. There's a little bit of sunlight coming

02:43:18.577 --> 02:43:23.613
through from the opposite side of it from the
direction of the light in the sky. It frames

02:43:23.613 --> 02:43:30.395
ambiently the outside of a figure that appears to
be humanoid that is sitting over a table, and you

02:43:30.395 --> 02:43:35.851
can hear some grinding or carving sound, but its
faced away from you. Looks to be some sort of workshop.

02:43:35.851 --> 02:43:37.496
TRAVIS: Keep going?

02:43:37.496 --> 02:43:38.471
SAM: Yeah.

02:43:38.471 --> 02:43:40.197
TRAVIS: All right, we'll push through.

02:43:40.197 --> 02:43:42.012
MATT: You push towards the first intersection.

02:43:42.012 --> 02:43:46.399
MARISHA: Can I see the tower-- the temple at all,
above the buildings?

02:43:46.399 --> 02:43:48.278
MATT: Yeah, you can see the top of the temple from
here.

02:43:48.278 --> 02:43:50.368
MARISHA: Okay, does this curve look like we're
still heading the right way?

02:43:50.368 --> 02:43:54.102
MATT: It'll start making towards the nearest
stairway that leads towards the top.

02:43:54.102 --> 02:43:56.961
LIAM: It's just the bottom of the structure that
curves around.

02:43:56.961 --> 02:44:01.327
MATT: As you approach the T-intersection, you hear
this murmuring of conversation coming from the

02:44:01.327 --> 02:44:05.313
left-hand side of it. (whispering)

02:44:05.313 --> 02:44:06.720
LIAM: I cast Comprehend Languages.

02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:08.417
MATT: You do, and you pick it up. It is Abyssal.

02:44:08.417 --> 02:44:10.074
LIAM: Abyssal?

02:44:10.074 --> 02:44:13.684
LAURA: Oh! No, Yasha can't--

02:44:13.684 --> 02:44:15.951
SAM: Yasha can speak that, no?

02:44:15.951 --> 02:44:18.154
MATT: I don't know, if you had her character
sheet, you would have the benefits of knowing

02:44:18.507 --> 02:44:27.186
that. But, not my responsibility. So you pick you
on it and the muttering is akin to, "Come, we have

02:44:27.186 --> 02:44:33.675
"to pick up the hunts. The food stores are running
dry this season." As that comes to you, you glance

02:44:33.675 --> 02:44:38.273
up to the side and you guys watch as two figures
round the corner. They're both mostly human in

02:44:38.273 --> 02:44:44.583
body, though their bodies are scaled and a dull
green-gray color. Their heads, fully serpentine,

02:44:44.583 --> 02:44:49.710
snake jaws-- the hood's not open, but retracted--
and they both have, strapped across their

02:44:49.710 --> 02:44:56.960
shoulders and torsos, longbows that are at rest,
and they have quivers filled with arrows. They

02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:05.126
walk past and glance over at the rest of your
crew. Make a deception check, Jester.

02:45:05.126 --> 02:45:10.793
SAM and LAURA: (hissing)

02:45:10.793 --> 02:45:16.614
LAURA: Big money. Okay, okay. 22.

02:45:16.614 --> 02:45:27.605
MATT: Yasha as well. The disguise didn't quite go
well, and Yasha and Caleb-- even in the clustered

02:45:27.605 --> 02:45:32.945
section-- catches some attention. The first one
keeps walking. The second one glances over and

02:45:32.945 --> 02:45:45.961
looks to the rest of you and, "Hey!" You hear in
Abyssal, "Hey, what've you got?" You guys hear (Abyssal).

02:45:45.961 --> 02:45:51.531
TRAVIS: As that one turns, I'll turn to Yasha and
I'll go (hisses) and punch her in the face and

02:45:51.531 --> 02:45:53.529
say, "Go down!"

02:45:53.529 --> 02:45:58.805
MATT: She goes (grunting). She's not used to
rolling with the punch.

02:45:58.805 --> 02:46:03.133
LIAM: You're going to take a dive.

02:46:03.133 --> 02:46:10.976
MATT: She goes down and the figure looks up, its
eyes narrowing and the tongue (slurping).

02:46:10.976 --> 02:46:15.921
TRAVIS: Stand over Yasha, take the rope, and start
tying her hands together.

02:46:15.921 --> 02:46:22.044
MATT: "Wait," to the other one, who stops, looks
back and goes-- begins to walk towards you,

02:46:22.044 --> 02:46:26.973
keeping a hand on the bow.

02:46:26.973 --> 02:46:29.546
LAURA: I cast Hold Person.

02:46:29.546 --> 02:46:31.297
TRAVIS: Oh no!

02:46:31.297 --> 02:46:33.267
LAURA: Sorry, I already said it. At 3rd-level.

02:46:33.267 --> 02:46:34.305
MATT: On both of them?

02:46:34.305 --> 02:46:36.044
LAURA: Yes.

02:46:36.244 --> 02:46:42.963
MATT: That's a failure; that's a 12. Oh, that's
cocked. And a natural four. They both fail. They

02:46:42.963 --> 02:46:45.910
both freeze in place.

02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:48.652
LAURA: We should tie them up and then go.

02:46:48.652 --> 02:46:51.190
TRAVIS: We're in the middle of the street. We
can't tie them up. We've got to go.

02:46:51.190 --> 02:46:52.263
LAURA: We're in the middle of the street?

02:46:52.263 --> 02:46:53.631
MATT: You're in the middle of the street.

02:46:53.631 --> 02:46:54.727
LAURA: Let's go. Let's walk quickly.

02:46:54.727 --> 02:46:56.859
MARISHA: Run.

02:46:56.859 --> 02:46:59.152
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're picking up and moving
expeditiously away.

02:46:59.152 --> 02:47:00.862
LAURA: I really should've charmed them instead of
held them, but let's go.

02:47:00.862 --> 02:47:01.936
TRAVIS: Yeah, or distraction.

02:47:01.936 --> 02:47:03.869
SAM: Want to do a distraction now?

02:47:03.869 --> 02:47:05.461
TRAVIS: Not now. We've got to go.

02:47:05.461 --> 02:47:06.911
LIAM: Distraction is them.

02:47:06.911 --> 02:47:11.561
MATT: They are currently paralyzed in the middle
of the street for the next minute. Once they're

02:47:11.561 --> 02:47:15.338
released, they're going to do whatever they do.

02:47:15.338 --> 02:47:19.987
TRAVIS: Do we seen anyone else around besides
those two?

02:47:19.987 --> 02:47:22.926
MATT: Right now? Make a perception check.

02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:26.548
TRAVIS: Oh, 20.

02:47:26.548 --> 02:47:31.662
MATT: Glancing about at this moment, the only
other figure you can see near this intersection is

02:47:31.662 --> 02:47:38.076
one of the patrolling, hunched creatures you saw
up on the temple itself on the second tier, and

02:47:38.076 --> 02:47:40.044
it's currently walking away from you and doesn't
seem to be paying attention.

02:47:40.044 --> 02:47:40.844
LAURA: Grab them.

02:47:40.844 --> 02:47:42.936
LIAM: Yeah, actually, we should chase them and
kill them because they could actually snap out of

02:47:42.936 --> 02:47:44.017
it at any second.

02:47:44.017 --> 02:47:45.193
SAM: We should kill them?

02:47:45.193 --> 02:47:46.728
TRAVIS and LIAM: Kill them.

02:47:46.728 --> 02:47:48.914
LAURA: Grab them; slit their throats.

02:47:48.914 --> 02:47:50.330
TRAVIS: They're large beings, right?

02:47:50.330 --> 02:47:53.025
SAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Pull them off the
street.

02:47:53.025 --> 02:47:54.794
SAM: Okay, Yasha.

02:47:54.794 --> 02:47:58.466
MATT: Hold on. While you guys are deciding on
this, every turn they get to make a save.

02:47:58.466 --> 02:48:00.624
LIAM: Yeah, that's right.

02:48:00.624 --> 02:48:05.344
MATT: Natural two and 11 plus two, 13. Yeah,
they're still held.

02:48:05.344 --> 02:48:07.615
TRAVIS, LAURA, and MARISHA: Pull them off the
street.

02:48:07.615 --> 02:48:09.538
SAM: You and Yasha should pull them off the
street.

02:48:09.538 --> 02:48:11.822
MATT: You guys lift their arms and pull them off.

02:48:11.822 --> 02:48:13.272
MARISHA: Weekend at Bernie's.

02:48:13.272 --> 02:48:14.581
SAM: Are there any doors around here?

02:48:14.581 --> 02:48:18.196
MATT: The building to the left of you was the one
that you saw the craftsman in. The one to the

02:48:18.196 --> 02:48:20.071
right, you can see there is an open doorway.

02:48:20.071 --> 02:48:20.972
LAURA: Is there anybody in there?

02:48:20.972 --> 02:48:21.887
SAM: Let's just go in?

02:48:21.887 --> 02:48:22.982
MATT: All right, you drag them over.

02:48:22.982 --> 02:48:25.552
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk forwards first to peek
in because I look like a snake.

02:48:25.552 --> 02:48:27.268
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

02:48:27.268 --> 02:48:32.435
TALIESIN: All right. That's terrible, 11.

02:48:32.435 --> 02:48:39.375
MATT: You glance inside. You can see what looks to
be a pile of rags on a small table in the corner,

02:48:39.375 --> 02:48:41.277
but nobody else appears to be in there.

02:48:41.277 --> 02:48:42.077
LAURA: Inside.

02:48:42.077 --> 02:48:42.976
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:48:42.976 --> 02:48:44.280
MATT: All right. You guys pull them inside.

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:45.742
LAURA: Wrap them up.

02:48:45.742 --> 02:48:48.893
MATT: Another 11 plus two, 13, failure. An eight
plus two; they're still--

02:48:48.893 --> 02:48:53.853
LAURA: Okay, tie them up as much as we can and
then gag their mouths. Toss them in a corner.

02:48:53.853 --> 02:48:55.824
TRAVIS: We're working the rope.

02:48:55.824 --> 02:48:57.158
MARISHA: Should we kill them?

02:48:57.158 --> 02:49:02.713
LIAM: Ja. They would kill us; we watched them
skinning the inhabitants of this--

02:49:02.713 --> 02:49:04.197
MATT: That's a five.

02:49:04.197 --> 02:49:05.479
SAM: Will they wake up if we hurt them now?

02:49:05.479 --> 02:49:06.569
MATT: 15.

02:49:06.569 --> 02:49:08.277
TRAVIS: Fuck it. I summon the sword, I run over,
and I shove it into his chest.

02:49:08.277 --> 02:49:08.931
MATT: What's your DC?

02:49:08.931 --> 02:49:09.768
LAURA: 15.

02:49:09.768 --> 02:49:10.998
MATT: One of them succeeds.

02:49:10.998 --> 02:49:12.450
LAURA: We're already tying him.

02:49:12.450 --> 02:49:13.923
MATT: You're in the process of it.

02:49:13.923 --> 02:49:16.317
MARISHA: He kills one guy. I snap the other guy's
neck.

02:49:16.317 --> 02:49:18.972
MATT: The guys that's paralyzed, going ahead and
attack.

02:49:18.972 --> 02:49:20.320
TRAVIS: I plunged the sword into his chest.

02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:21.930
MATT: Attack twice, each time with advantage.

02:49:21.930 --> 02:49:22.901
TRAVIS: Okay, with advantage.

02:49:22.901 --> 02:49:24.342
MATT: Both hits are crits because he is
paralyzed.

02:49:24.342 --> 02:49:27.109
TRAVIS: Amazing. That is a 16?

02:49:27.109 --> 02:49:28.112
MATT: 16 hits.

02:49:28.112 --> 02:49:29.409
TRAVIS: Are they automatic crits?

02:49:29.409 --> 02:49:30.336
LAURA: Yeah.

02:49:30.336 --> 02:49:35.654
TRAVIS: Oh, the damage is a crit. The second one
is a 23. Yeah, 23 is the highest one.

02:49:35.654 --> 02:49:37.601
MATT: Yep, both hit, both crit.

02:49:37.601 --> 02:49:39.304
TRAVIS: Both hit, both crit, okay.

02:49:39.304 --> 02:49:40.571
MARISHA: You said one saved?

02:49:40.571 --> 02:49:41.851
MATT: One saved.

02:49:41.851 --> 02:49:43.648
LAURA: But we were putting things into their
mouths.

02:49:43.648 --> 02:49:47.520
MATT: You were tying them up and (gasping) begins
to-- but we'll get to that in just a minute.

02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:49.309
TRAVIS: 29.

02:49:49.309 --> 02:49:57.374
MATT: You carve through him. These are more ranged
hunters; they're not as hardy as some of the other

02:49:57.374 --> 02:50:02.986
ones out there, and this one, you manage to in
just two quick swings, carve through the chest and

02:50:02.986 --> 02:50:09.087
take down most of the throat-- just tears open. It
crumples to the ground, dead. The other, who is

02:50:09.087 --> 02:50:14.726
currently being bound, (snarling), begins to start
making noise and getting ready to--

02:50:14.726 --> 02:50:16.375
LIAM: Are we in a stone room?

02:50:16.375 --> 02:50:17.411
MATT: You're inside a stone room.

02:50:17.411 --> 02:50:18.746
LIAM: Is there wood?

02:50:18.746 --> 02:50:21.962
MATT: There's not much in the way of wood. It's
mostly stone in here.

02:50:21.962 --> 02:50:22.958
LIAM: Fire Bolt.

02:50:22.958 --> 02:50:24.051
TRAVIS and LAURA: No!

02:50:24.051 --> 02:50:26.437
MATT: Fire Bolt or Fireball?

02:50:26.437 --> 02:50:27.913
LIAM: Bolt.

02:50:27.913 --> 02:50:29.320
MATT: Okay.

02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:30.768
LAURA: Wouldn't that still make noise?

02:50:30.768 --> 02:50:32.435
MATT: It'll make a little bit.

02:50:32.435 --> 02:50:33.971
MARISHA: Great, so let's just fucking kill really
stealthily really fast!

02:50:33.971 --> 02:50:35.274
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack, everyone who's
doing this.

02:50:35.274 --> 02:50:38.035
SAM: I'm shooting with a crossbow.

02:50:38.035 --> 02:50:41.293
MATT: Okay, it is definitely flanked, so you get a
sneak attack, but you don't have advantage on it

02:50:41.293 --> 02:50:43.326
because it is not fully bound.

02:50:43.326 --> 02:50:44.248
SAM: 22 to hit?

02:50:44.248 --> 02:50:44.975
MATT: That hits.

02:50:44.975 --> 02:50:45.740
MARISHA: 24.

02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:46.565
MATT: Hits.

02:50:46.565 --> 02:50:52.147
LIAM: 17.

02:50:52.147 --> 02:50:53.449
MATT: Hits.

02:50:53.449 --> 02:50:58.406
MARISHA: Six damage; I'm going to stun him.

02:50:58.406 --> 02:51:01.365
MATT: Natural nine, fails.

02:51:01.365 --> 02:51:03.292
SAM: 17 damage.

02:51:03.292 --> 02:51:05.744
MATT: What's the Fire Bolt do?

02:51:05.744 --> 02:51:11.240
LIAM: It's 2d10, which is 19.

02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:18.900
MATT: Okay. You watch as he (grunting) freezes up
from the stun and then (gasping) takes a bolt to

02:51:18.900 --> 02:51:24.229
the throat. The eyes begin to roll back as a Fire
Bolt blasts in its chest, and you watch as it

02:51:24.229 --> 02:51:29.327
burns the edges of its face up in cinders. It goes
quiet before limping to the ground, the smoke

02:51:29.327 --> 02:51:31.066
coming up from its smoldering corpse.

02:51:31.066 --> 02:51:32.282
TRAVIS: Out.

02:51:32.282 --> 02:51:33.454
LAURA: Cover him up!

02:51:33.454 --> 02:51:36.075
MATT: At this point, the rags in the corner begin
to shift as you watch what appears to be an

02:51:36.075 --> 02:51:39.943
individual sleeping in the corner begins to come
to and it (raspy breathing)--

02:51:39.943 --> 02:51:40.799
MARISHA: God, go.

02:51:40.799 --> 02:51:44.012
MATT: Look up, and you can see what looks to be a
more humanoid-- one of the most humanoid of the

02:51:44.012 --> 02:51:47.677
ones ones you've seen there, but with the scales--
what you managed to make yourself look like--

02:51:47.677 --> 02:51:50.340
begins to come to consciousness and goes
(snarling).

02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:51.607
LAURA: Oh, shit.

02:51:51.607 --> 02:51:52.892
MARISHA: Does he see us?

02:51:52.892 --> 02:51:54.710
MATT: Yeah, you woke him the middle of his sleep.

02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:55.677
LAURA: Charm Person!

02:51:55.677 --> 02:51:56.891
SAM: Jesus.

02:51:56.891 --> 02:51:59.796
MATT: That is 15. it succeeds.

02:51:59.796 --> 02:52:01.852
MARISHA: You're supposed to be better at this.

02:52:01.852 --> 02:52:04.230
LAURA: Somebody do fucking something, because he
shook it off.

02:52:04.230 --> 02:52:06.427
MATT: (snarling)

02:52:06.427 --> 02:52:09.329
MARISHA: Throat punch!

02:52:10.318 --> 02:52:16.610
MATT: Go for it. The words you hear are, "Who are
you? Help!" as the shout is beginning to come out,

02:52:16.610 --> 02:52:18.187
but you go ahead and--

02:52:18.187 --> 02:52:19.587
MARISHA: Uh-huh, 15.

02:52:19.587 --> 02:52:21.430
MATT: Yeah, 15, that hits.

02:52:21.430 --> 02:52:22.985
MARISHA: Stun.

02:52:23.792 --> 02:52:25.266
MATT: That's a failure, yeah.

02:52:25.266 --> 02:52:26.810
MARISHA: Uh-huh, he's stunned.

02:52:26.810 --> 02:52:28.089
MATT: Stuns in the bed.

02:52:28.089 --> 02:52:29.837
TALIESIN: (sigh) Sacred Flame.

02:52:29.837 --> 02:52:33.145
MATT: All right. This individual doesn't have a
lot of hit points, so let's say for the sake of

02:52:33.145 --> 02:52:42.481
brevity here, being stunned, you guys quickly--.
Yep. However, it did have the opportunity to shout

02:52:42.481 --> 02:52:44.624
out one phrase. We'll see if the guard heard it.

02:52:44.624 --> 02:52:45.518
SAM: Oh boy.

02:52:45.518 --> 02:52:48.170
TRAVIS: You know what'd be great right now? A
distraction. Maybe fire?

02:52:48.170 --> 02:52:49.357
MATT: It's a natural 15.

02:52:49.357 --> 02:52:50.110
SAM: Set fire to the house?

02:52:50.110 --> 02:52:51.498
LIAM: It's all stone.

02:52:51.498 --> 02:52:53.153
TRAVIS: It is all stone? There's no wood? There's
no nothing?

02:52:53.153 --> 02:52:57.578
MATT: Inside this chamber, it's all stone.
There're stone tablets that have been carved and

02:52:57.687 --> 02:53:02.015
then placed up against each other. There's
occasional scenes you can see through, and the

02:53:02.015 --> 02:53:06.871
ceiling above appears to be slats of stone that
have been placed in a lattice formation.

02:53:06.871 --> 02:53:12.994
MARISHA: I pull out all of the cherry bombs that I
have and I go-- fucking fireworks!

02:53:12.994 --> 02:53:15.128
LAURA: But wait, maybe nobody heard.

02:53:15.128 --> 02:53:16.476
TRAVIS: Let's just get out.

02:53:16.476 --> 02:53:20.252
SAM: Is there any hole in the ceiling or anything?
Is there a roof?

02:53:20.252 --> 02:53:21.996
TRAVIS: Ceiling stone too?

02:53:21.996 --> 02:53:25.212
MATT: The ceiling, looking up-- there is no second
floor or anything, and it looks like it's just a

02:53:25.212 --> 02:53:33.005
continuation of stone. It looks like a series of
thin slats have been placed one next to the other

02:53:33.005 --> 02:53:35.290
in a layering to create a ceiling.

02:53:35.290 --> 02:53:36.496
TALIESIN: Back door?

02:53:36.496 --> 02:53:38.672
MATT: No, this entrance is the only way in and
out. There's a window--

02:53:38.672 --> 02:53:40.433
TRAVIS: Out.

02:53:40.433 --> 02:53:43.339
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly grab two arrows
from one of the dead lizards and stick them in his

02:53:43.339 --> 02:53:46.879
chest, and I'm going to walk out. I want to go--
yeah.

02:53:46.879 --> 02:53:48.481
SAM: It was a suicide.

02:53:48.481 --> 02:53:51.679
LAURA: Maybe they all fought each other.

02:53:51.679 --> 02:53:57.707
MATT: You guys turn the corner, and as you exit,
you can see that large, looming, slithering snake

02:53:57.707 --> 02:54:04.321
figure with the huge scimitar that's probably 15
foot from tip of tail to nose. Thick, burly body,

02:54:04.321 --> 02:54:06.971
slithering its way towards you.

02:54:06.971 --> 02:54:08.211
SAM: Like, can see us?

02:54:08.211 --> 02:54:09.734
MARISHA: Yeah, what do you mean towards us?

02:54:09.734 --> 02:54:13.894
MATT: Meaning whatever noise, this figure
managed-- I rolled high on its perception-- to

02:54:13.894 --> 02:54:17.150
pick up the sound of its call, and it's making its
way in your direction.

02:54:17.150 --> 02:54:25.078
TRAVIS: Okay. I will point down the street away
from us and go (hissing) and cast Major Image, and

02:54:25.078 --> 02:54:33.729
I will summon the image of a manticore, a large
manticore roaring and thrashing in the streets.

02:54:33.729 --> 02:54:36.360
LAURA: Oh, that's tight.

02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:40.554
MATT: All right, full sound and everything?
Because Major Image you can do the full spread--

02:54:40.554 --> 02:54:43.662
TRAVIS: The whole shebang-- make sound, it smells,
the whole thing.

02:54:43.662 --> 02:54:48.320
MATT: So now, suddenly, in the middle of this
room, all of you turn and look and see as a

02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:53.270
full-grown manticore, akin to the one that you
battled not that long ago beneath the mines near

02:54:53.270 --> 02:55:00.652
Alfield, you see wings unfurl (roaring). All of a
sudden, all eyes in the city shift to this

02:55:01.404 --> 02:55:05.969
creature. In a matter of moments, you can see
arrows being loosed in its direction, hitting the

02:55:05.969 --> 02:55:11.739
ground near it. The snake that was approaching you
spins around, begins to draw its scimitar (snarl)

02:55:11.739 --> 02:55:13.242
and it begins to approach.

02:55:13.242 --> 02:55:14.135
TRAVIS: (shouting) Go!

02:55:14.135 --> 02:55:15.094
SAM: On us, or on the--?

02:55:15.094 --> 02:55:16.367
TRAVIS and MATT: Manticore.

02:55:16.367 --> 02:55:17.175
SAM: Great, let's run.

02:55:17.175 --> 02:55:18.063
LAURA: We run away.

02:55:18.063 --> 02:55:19.608
MATT: You put that behind where the serpent was?

02:55:19.608 --> 02:55:21.446
TRAVIS: Yes, so he has to turn and move away from
us.

02:55:21.446 --> 02:55:25.139
MATT: Okay. You guys arc in the completely
opposite direction heading towards where the base

02:55:25.139 --> 02:55:29.909
of this temple is. There is another one of those
that is currently at the bottom of the stairway

02:55:29.909 --> 02:55:33.456
that is making its way in your direction.

02:55:33.456 --> 02:55:36.184
LAURA: I point at the manticore.

02:55:36.184 --> 02:55:38.927
MATT: You point at the manticore?

02:55:38.927 --> 02:55:44.601
TRAVIS: I can't. I point at the manticore. No, you
did it.

02:55:44.601 --> 02:55:46.090
MATT: She's the one who did it.

02:55:46.090 --> 02:55:47.668
LAURA: Hey man, I look like a snake person!

02:55:47.668 --> 02:55:49.295
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:55:49.295 --> 02:55:52.744
SAM: This is going to be great.

02:55:52.744 --> 02:55:56.589
MATT: The DC's low on these because you're
disguised.

02:55:56.589 --> 02:55:58.209
TALIESIN: Hey!

02:55:58.209 --> 02:55:59.614
LAURA: Nine.

02:55:59.614 --> 02:56:01.004
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:56:01.004 --> 02:56:05.152
SAM: Just had to beat a ten.

02:56:05.152 --> 02:56:10.903
MATT: You had to beat a ten. You push, and it
turns around and sees the manticore and looks at

02:56:10.903 --> 02:56:16.532
you curiously. It has to take a moment to decide
which is more dangerous, the manticore or this

02:56:16.532 --> 02:56:24.000
curious serpent. Goes ahead and grabs you by the
chest and begins dragging you with it.

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:27.163
TALIESIN: It makes a grab for her?

02:56:27.163 --> 02:56:30.871
MATT: Yeah. It can't choose, so it just grabs
you.

02:56:30.871 --> 02:56:33.889
TALIESIN: Blindness. I'm going to blind him before
he grabs her.

02:56:33.889 --> 02:56:38.563
MATT: Okay. Well first, it has to try and grapple
you, so go ahead if you want to fight it.

02:56:38.563 --> 02:56:40.448
LAURA: Okay, yeah, I'll try to back away.

02:56:40.448 --> 02:56:45.252
MATT: All right, so acrobatics check. Natural two,
so make an acrobatics or athletics check to try

02:56:45.252 --> 02:56:46.482
and break it.

02:56:46.482 --> 02:56:47.638
LAURA: Cool. One.

02:56:47.638 --> 02:56:49.793
MATT: Yeah, it grabs you. However, what's the DC
on the spell?

02:56:49.793 --> 02:56:52.146
TALIESIN: Constitution 16.

02:56:52.146 --> 02:56:59.837
MATT: Natural two again! It was like 20-- two. All
of a sudden, it loses sight and you see its eyes

02:56:59.837 --> 02:57:06.658
starting to blink out where once the piercing
yellow snake eyes fade to a snowblind white

02:57:06.658 --> 02:57:14.789
(snarling and hissing). Pulls its blade out and
looks around, looking freaked out at the process.

02:57:14.789 --> 02:57:17.529
You have to break that grapple; it's still holding
you.

02:57:17.529 --> 02:57:18.955
LAURA: Oh, I--

02:57:18.955 --> 02:57:22.465
MATT: Make another athletics or acrobatics check.
What're you making?

02:57:22.465 --> 02:57:25.858
SAM: Jesus. Oh, nope. Do another.

02:57:25.858 --> 02:57:29.904
LAURA: That was a very aggressive roll. Athletics
or acrobatics?

02:57:29.904 --> 02:57:31.059
MATT: Yep, your choice.

02:57:31.059 --> 02:57:32.019
LAURA: Acrobatics.

02:57:32.019 --> 02:57:32.652
MATT: All right.

02:57:32.652 --> 02:57:33.721
TALIESIN: Ah, god!

02:57:33.721 --> 02:57:36.472
LAURA: My dear lord! Fucking seven, but he still
rolled a natural two, right, no?

02:57:36.472 --> 02:57:40.454
MATT: Well, no, that was the last time. He rolled
a natural eight, so he's still holding onto you.

02:57:40.454 --> 02:57:45.972
He's blind, but he's holding on to you. The
scimitar's out and he's swinging it wildly at

02:57:45.972 --> 02:57:49.069
whatever's in the area now that it can't see and
is (gnashing).

02:57:49.069 --> 02:57:52.323
TRAVIS: Can I take the sword and take a shot right
at his wrist that's holding her? With the hand

02:57:52.323 --> 02:57:53.557
that's holding onto Jester?

02:57:53.557 --> 02:57:54.567
MATT: Sure. It's going to be at a major penalty.

02:57:54.917 --> 02:57:56.119
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:57:56.119 --> 02:57:58.316
MATT: So go ahead and roll.

02:57:58.316 --> 02:58:00.671
TRAVIS: 17.

02:58:00.671 --> 02:58:04.132
MATT: 17? Okay. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:58:04.132 --> 02:58:06.165
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:58:06.165 --> 02:58:08.251
SAM: Oh boy, this is going terribly.

02:58:08.251 --> 02:58:13.473
TRAVIS: It's going great, we're doing good. Oh,
that's good! That's a 14.

02:58:13.473 --> 02:58:16.425
MATT: Okay. I'll say that'll give you advantage on
your next check.

02:58:16.425 --> 02:58:17.323
LAURA: Okay.

02:58:17.323 --> 02:58:18.492
MATT: It doesn't break the hold.

02:58:18.492 --> 02:58:30.799
SAM: I will step forward and say to the beast: How
does the Lucidian Ocean say goodbye? It just

02:58:30.799 --> 02:58:35.963
waves. And I'll cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter on
it.

02:58:37.823 --> 02:58:38.963
MATT: Okay. Natural four.

02:58:38.963 --> 02:58:42.363
(cheering)

02:58:42.600 --> 02:58:47.427
MATT: Falls to the ground and begins chuckling,
though in the middle of this chaos it is now

02:58:47.427 --> 02:58:49.210
blinded and laughing. It releases you.

02:58:49.210 --> 02:58:50.177
LAURA: Okay, good.

02:58:50.177 --> 02:58:54.737
MATT: The manticore is still roaring. Creatures
are now flooding out of the city to combat this

02:58:54.737 --> 02:58:58.664
and you can see some of them are swinging and are
beginning to notice something strange...

02:58:58.664 --> 02:58:59.836
LAURA: Ooh, run away!

02:58:59.836 --> 02:59:01.455
MARISHA: Run, run, run!

02:59:01.455 --> 02:59:04.118
MATT: All right, so you guys are charging towards
the temple. You bypass that one. Now you're

02:59:04.118 --> 02:59:10.235
heading up the stairs. Up across the way, there's
one of those crotchety snake people that you saw

02:59:10.235 --> 02:59:14.853
patrolling the upper area who has its longbow out
and is currently firing one after another arrow

02:59:14.853 --> 02:59:18.309
toward the manticore. It's moved off to the side.
It doesn't seem to immediately notice your

02:59:18.309 --> 02:59:21.639
presence as you approach. If you guys are trying
to stealth by without getting its attention, I

02:59:21.639 --> 02:59:24.216
need you all to make another stealth check now
that you've engaged in combat.

02:59:24.216 --> 02:59:25.999
LAURA: Add ten!

02:59:25.999 --> 02:59:27.792
SAM: You'll need it.

02:59:27.792 --> 02:59:30.642
MATT: Well, hold on. Pass Without a Trace, is it
concentration?

02:59:30.642 --> 02:59:31.878
LAURA: Yes.

02:59:31.878 --> 02:59:34.420
MATT: Because you cast Hold Person since then.

02:59:34.420 --> 02:59:36.989
LAURA: Oh, Hold Person is a-- you're right.

02:59:36.989 --> 02:59:40.358
SAM: Spell management!

02:59:40.358 --> 02:59:43.329
LAURA: Sorry, I didn't realize Hold Person was a
concentration.

02:59:43.329 --> 02:59:46.138
MATT: It's okay. It is. So straight stealth
checks, guys.

02:59:46.138 --> 02:59:47.941
TRAVIS: Yep. 13.

02:59:47.941 --> 02:59:49.994
MARISHA: 22.

02:59:49.994 --> 02:59:50.896
LIAM: Seven.

02:59:50.896 --> 02:59:52.062
SAM: Roll for Yasha. 20!

02:59:52.062 --> 02:59:53.245
LAURA: 12.

02:59:53.245 --> 02:59:54.462
TALIESIN: 17.

02:59:54.462 --> 02:59:56.702
TRAVIS: I have Yasha's character sheet and she
rolled a ten.

02:59:56.702 --> 03:00:02.974
MATT: Okay. Hold on.

03:00:02.974 --> 03:00:04.679
TALIESIN: I mean.

03:00:04.679 --> 03:00:06.310
MARISHA: It was super down the middle.

03:00:06.310 --> 03:00:10.137
LIAM: Every week we're like, this is the episode
where we start thinking. This is the one.

03:00:10.137 --> 03:00:11.617
MATT: There we go.

03:00:11.617 --> 03:00:13.481
TALIESIN: (singing and whistling) Something's out
there.

03:00:13.481 --> 03:00:14.888
MATT: Natural 20 on his end.

03:00:14.888 --> 03:00:17.252
ALL: Aww!

03:00:17.252 --> 03:00:19.259
MARISHA: What do you mean?

03:00:19.259 --> 03:00:21.295
MATT: I rolled a natural 20 on my d20.

03:00:21.295 --> 03:00:22.533
MARISHA: No, I know what you mean.

03:00:22.533 --> 03:00:25.533
MATT: (arrows whizzing) (gnashing)

03:00:25.533 --> 03:00:26.930
TRAVIS: How far is this person?

03:00:26.930 --> 03:00:31.023
MATT: About 15 feet above you, above the stairs,
just in the middle of the open. Glancing off to

03:00:31.023 --> 03:00:33.567
the side, the manticore still drawing most of the
attention, but people are starting to figure out

03:00:33.567 --> 03:00:34.972
the weirdness about it.

03:00:34.972 --> 03:00:38.343
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to Misty Step up
behind them and I will kick them down the stairs

03:00:38.343 --> 03:00:39.606
towards the rest of us?

03:00:39.606 --> 03:00:40.585
SAM: Ooh.

03:00:40.585 --> 03:00:41.551
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yes!

03:00:41.551 --> 03:00:42.263
MATT: Yes, you can.

03:00:42.263 --> 03:00:43.352
MARISHA: Oh my god, yes!

03:00:43.352 --> 03:00:46.805
MATT: In a whisp of dark shadow energy you see
Fjord just vanishes from sight and teleports right

03:00:46.805 --> 03:00:49.194
behind. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

03:00:49.194 --> 03:00:53.068
TRAVIS: Oh god, those used to be really great for
me. 17!

03:00:53.068 --> 03:01:02.046
MATT: Natural four. You Sparta this fucker right
off the side of the temple. You watch him tumbling

03:01:02.046 --> 03:01:07.208
down the entire length of the side of this temple
before landing on the ground and skidding and

03:01:07.208 --> 03:01:11.062
looking unconscious and bleeding out of the side
of his mouth at the base of the temple.

03:01:11.062 --> 03:01:12.950
LIAM: Fire Bolt.

03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:14.546
MATT: Okay.

03:01:14.546 --> 03:01:16.359
SAM: On the dead guy?

03:01:16.359 --> 03:01:18.235
LIAM: Yeah. Is he dead or is he unconscious?

03:01:18.235 --> 03:01:19.506
MATT: He's unconscious.

03:01:19.506 --> 03:01:25.080
LIAM: Oh, yeah. That's a 22.

03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:28.002
MATT: Technically, he's prone because he's on the
ground, so it would be at disadvantage. Roll one

03:01:28.002 --> 03:01:29.513
more time.

03:01:29.513 --> 03:01:31.909
LIAM: It's a 23.

03:01:31.909 --> 03:01:40.298
MATT: That hits, roll damage. So with the damage
he took from the fall there. Oh, yeah.

03:01:40.298 --> 03:01:44.917
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not me, jesus. I was looking at
Yasha's and it was like, "When did I get Necrotic Shroud?"

03:01:44.917 --> 03:01:47.501
LIAM: It's five.

03:01:47.501 --> 03:01:50.050
SAM: (exaggerated Arnold Schwarzenegger accent)
Five points of damage.

03:01:50.050 --> 03:01:53.339
LIAM: That's the sound it makes. Phoomph.

03:01:53.339 --> 03:02:01.018
MATT: So he's burning and not moving. You assume.

03:02:01.018 --> 03:02:02.430
LAURA: He's even more unconscious now.

03:02:02.430 --> 03:02:04.008
TRAVIS: Let's get the fuck out of here.

03:02:04.008 --> 03:02:05.254
LAURA: Keep going.

03:02:05.254 --> 03:02:06.936
SAM: Is there an entrance to this tower?

03:02:06.936 --> 03:02:10.607
MATT: Oh, you're going stairs up the side. It
levels off towards the top of it, but you don't

03:02:10.607 --> 03:02:12.021
know what's at the top there.

03:02:12.021 --> 03:02:13.068
MARISHA: Is there anyone following us?

03:02:13.068 --> 03:02:14.516
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:02:14.516 --> 03:02:16.045
SAM: Many people.

03:02:16.045 --> 03:02:17.684
TALIESIN: Everybody.

03:02:17.684 --> 03:02:19.843
MARISHA: Okay. 15.

03:02:19.843 --> 03:02:26.569
MATT: Glancing around, I mean, the manticore's
causing a huge ruckus in the middle of the city

03:02:26.569 --> 03:02:32.968
and those that have begun to realize that it's an
illusion are looking around confusedly and at the

03:02:32.968 --> 03:02:37.237
moment do not see you, but that time is going to
be very short because you're out in the middle of

03:02:37.237 --> 03:02:41.261
the sunlight. The trees aren't above you now. This
is an open clearing in the middle of the jungle

03:02:41.261 --> 03:02:46.103
and you're just running up the side of these
temple stairs with the light down upon you from the sky.

03:02:46.103 --> 03:02:47.979
LIAM: How tall is this person who's just died?

03:02:47.979 --> 03:02:52.371
MATT: Maybe-- from foot to shoulder?

03:02:52.371 --> 03:02:53.067
LIAM: Yeah.

03:02:53.067 --> 03:02:54.264
MATT: About four foot.

03:02:54.264 --> 03:02:55.507
LIAM: He's only four feet?

03:02:55.507 --> 03:02:56.648
MATT: Yeah. It's like a tiny, hunched--

03:02:56.648 --> 03:03:01.754
LIAM: Okay, I take out some iron and I go
(whooshing) and he shrinks to an eighth of that

03:03:01.754 --> 03:03:04.289
and I pick him up.

03:03:04.289 --> 03:03:05.935
MATT: Wait, the one you just shot?

03:03:05.935 --> 03:03:07.258
LIAM: Yeah, I don't want to leave him here.

03:03:07.258 --> 03:03:08.764
MATT: He's at the bottom of the temple.

03:03:08.764 --> 03:03:11.080
LIAM: Oh, he went down there? I thought he was at
our feet.

03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:15.331
MATT: No, you guys have been climbing the temple
and he kicked him down off the side of it. It's all good.

03:03:15.331 --> 03:03:16.959
LIAM: I would only do it if he was right where we
were.

03:03:16.959 --> 03:03:18.032
MATT: Right. No worries.

03:03:18.032 --> 03:03:19.280
LAURA: Let's just keep running.

03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:21.864
TRAVIS: Yeah. In! Out of light. Out of the way.

03:03:21.864 --> 03:03:26.612
MATT: Okay. So as that idea flashes through your
mind, that would be cool, but it's not going to

03:03:26.612 --> 03:03:30.309
work, so you keep rushing and we come back to the
moment as you guys dart up the side of the temple.

03:03:30.309 --> 03:03:34.297
Everyone make one more stealth check now that
you've had that brief encounter and teleported

03:03:34.297 --> 03:03:37.703
behind to make sure that nobody catches you before
you reach the top portion.

03:03:37.703 --> 03:03:38.939
MARISHA: Stealth you said?

03:03:38.939 --> 03:03:40.547
MATT: Stealth, yes.

03:03:40.547 --> 03:03:42.489
MARISHA: Oh god.

03:03:42.489 --> 03:03:46.051
TRAVIS: 12 for me. Natural 18 for Yasha.

03:03:46.051 --> 03:03:47.295
MARISHA: 12.

03:03:47.295 --> 03:03:48.065
LIAM: 11.

03:03:48.065 --> 03:03:48.757
SAM: 20.

03:03:48.757 --> 03:03:49.624
LAURA: 19.

03:03:49.624 --> 03:03:50.596
TALIESIN: 17.

03:03:50.596 --> 03:03:55.348
MATT: That's still a pretty high average and it's
more of an average thing. So a couple of stumbles

03:03:55.348 --> 03:04:00.176
coming up the stairs from some of you, but largely
you make it, cresting to the top of the platform.

03:04:00.176 --> 03:04:06.993
You get there for a second, take a few breaths and
realize glancing over to the side that people are

03:04:06.993 --> 03:04:15.746
still emerging, looking over the side and you can
see dozens of these snake people are emerging from

03:04:15.746 --> 03:04:20.769
the buildings and heading towards the sound of
this raging manticore. There are those that are

03:04:20.769 --> 03:04:23.741
now scattering from the manticore, trying to
engage them to tell them it's not what they think

03:04:23.741 --> 03:04:28.132
it is. There are eyes glancing around and you can
see the sentinels are starting to-- But you guys

03:04:28.132 --> 03:04:31.859
are keeping low and out of sight. No one at the
moment seems to notice where you are and the few

03:04:31.859 --> 03:04:36.823
that have noticed you you've either taken out or
have lost sight of where you were traveling. So

03:04:36.823 --> 03:04:45.768
for the moment, you feel safe. At the top of the
temple, you can see some sort of a worship

03:04:45.768 --> 03:04:52.325
terrace. There's torch-bearing statues of snakes
sitting near the corners of each of these five

03:04:52.325 --> 03:05:00.170
sides of the temple, similar in shape to the one
that you found, the idol. In fact, at the top of

03:05:00.170 --> 03:05:06.163
each of these torches, there's a similar golden
idol, but while the one you have is smooth, each

03:05:06.163 --> 03:05:11.267
of these has a carved divot on the inside where
the torch itself is actually burned in. Or where

03:05:11.267 --> 03:05:16.961
materials are placed in to burn as a torch when
the night comes or for any ceremonial use it requires.

03:05:16.961 --> 03:05:18.969
TRAVIS: The top is open air?

03:05:18.969 --> 03:05:24.135
MATT: Right now, it's just an open platform. You
do see in the center of it a heavy stone tablet

03:05:24.135 --> 03:05:31.859
about 12-foot by six-foot the rests directly in
the center. You can see metal rings that are

03:05:31.859 --> 03:05:40.830
bolted in with metal rivets that hold it on the
sides of the tablet. The stone itself appears to

03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:46.319
be stained with a variety of various shades of
stain.

03:05:46.319 --> 03:05:49.441
SAM: Like blood?

03:05:49.441 --> 03:05:53.685
TALIESIN: Oak, mahogany, rosewood.

03:05:53.685 --> 03:05:55.615
TALIESIN and MATT: So much stain.

03:05:55.615 --> 03:05:57.187
LAURA: Where are we supposed to go?

03:05:57.187 --> 03:05:58.709
TRAVIS: Yeah, we head towards the tablet.

03:05:58.709 --> 03:06:03.761
MARISHA: So wait, you said that there are tablets
with rings on the corners of the tablet and splatter--

03:06:03.761 --> 03:06:09.785
MATT: There was one stone table about 12-foot by
six-foot and on the sides of it there are rings

03:06:09.785 --> 03:06:13.453
that are bolted in and there are stains across the
surface.

03:06:13.453 --> 03:06:15.101
TRAVIS: Of the crimson variety?

03:06:15.101 --> 03:06:16.447
MATT: Yep.

03:06:16.447 --> 03:06:17.593
MARISHA: Yeah, super sacrifice-y.

03:06:17.593 --> 03:06:21.929
LIAM: Obviously for killing. With all the reading
I have done, can I ascertain or have a good guess

03:06:21.929 --> 03:06:24.107
of what this is used for besides?

03:06:24.107 --> 03:06:25.802
MATT: Yeah, you have a good idea.

03:06:25.802 --> 03:06:30.653
LIAM: Yeah, I know it's for killing people, but
does it do something? To do something. Summon

03:06:30.653 --> 03:06:33.245
things, make a god happy...

03:06:33.245 --> 03:06:35.091
TALIESIN: Does it look like a trap door to me?

03:06:35.091 --> 03:06:36.138
LIAM: I have read many books.

03:06:36.138 --> 03:06:40.153
MATT: Well, make an arcana check and make a
religion check.

03:06:40.153 --> 03:06:41.809
TALIESIN: All right.

03:06:41.809 --> 03:06:43.211
LIAM: I got a one.

03:06:43.211 --> 03:06:44.795
MATT: Okay. You're not entirely certain.

03:06:44.795 --> 03:06:45.937
TALIESIN: I got a 12.

03:06:45.937 --> 03:06:47.363
LIAM: Not my neighborhood.

03:06:47.363 --> 03:06:49.513
MATT: You get the sense that this is for
sacrifices, but you're not entirely certain to

03:06:49.513 --> 03:06:54.440
what ends and to what purpose, whether it's just
ceremonial or for a specific purpose.

03:06:54.440 --> 03:06:57.024
TALIESIN: Okay. And it doesn't look like it
moves?

03:06:57.024 --> 03:06:58.359
SAM: We're still out in the open?

03:06:58.359 --> 03:07:00.970
MATT: You're out in the open on the top of this
temple, but you do see, as you're inspecting the

03:07:00.970 --> 03:07:05.023
table and looking around, there is a trap door
made of the same color stone that has a handle

03:07:05.023 --> 03:07:07.327
built on it that you can pull back.

03:07:07.327 --> 03:07:09.406
SAM: Should I check for traps?

03:07:09.406 --> 03:07:10.394
LIAM: Yeah. Is it safe?

03:07:10.394 --> 03:07:15.696
SAM: For sure. I'll check for traps. 18.
Investigation.

03:07:16.220 --> 03:07:21.060
MATT: All right. It looks to not be trapped.
Though it is locked.

03:07:21.060 --> 03:07:25.722
SAM: All right, I'll unlock it. That's 28!

03:07:25.722 --> 03:07:32.123
MATT: 28. Getting down to this device, you can see
it's an intricate, thick, long key, what would

03:07:32.123 --> 03:07:38.375
have probably been that long and have a whole
series of intricately designed cliffs to it to hit

03:07:38.375 --> 03:07:41.082
all of the various--

03:07:41.082 --> 03:07:42.064
SAM: Tumblers?

03:07:42.064 --> 03:07:46.805
MATT: Tumblers, thank you. To get this to open.
However, you manage to get multiple angles and

03:07:46.805 --> 03:07:50.894
press and hold, and press and hold with all of
your tools. It takes everything in your bag to get

03:07:50.894 --> 03:07:57.713
through it, but you manage to just hit each one
properly and lift, and it pulls open with a

03:07:57.713 --> 03:07:58.836
grinding sound.

03:07:58.836 --> 03:07:59.898
LAURA: Shut up, Nott! That was very good.

03:07:59.898 --> 03:08:01.135
SAM: That was not supposed to work!

03:08:01.135 --> 03:08:02.006
LAURA: That was really good.

03:08:02.006 --> 03:08:03.971
SAM: That was luck. That was dumb luck.

03:08:03.971 --> 03:08:05.814
TALIESIN: Let's get in. We're all going to get in.
Come on.

03:08:05.814 --> 03:08:12.991
MATT: You do hear a smattering of hissing and
growling sounds that are getting louder and louder.

03:08:12.991 --> 03:08:16.773
LAURA: Get inside of it. (mumbling) Can you
re-lock the door or something?

03:08:16.773 --> 03:08:19.374
SAM: Probably not, but I can try.

03:08:19.374 --> 03:08:23.097
LAURA: Okay, we'll just shut it and hope they
don't notice that we came up here. Let's go.

03:08:23.097 --> 03:08:27.949
MATT: Okay. You all dart inside. At this point, as
you are stepping inside, you see on the opposite

03:08:27.949 --> 03:08:36.095
end, rushing up the edge, you see Jamedi go,
"(huffing) Very good," and he jumps inside with

03:08:36.095 --> 03:08:37.752
the rest of you.

03:08:37.752 --> 03:08:38.652
MARISHA: Where's Avantika?

03:08:38.652 --> 03:08:39.879
MATT: "I have not seen her."

03:08:39.879 --> 03:08:40.778
MARISHA: Bullshit.

03:08:40.778 --> 03:08:41.783
MATT: "I haven't!"

03:08:41.783 --> 03:08:42.855
MARISHA: Are you lying?

03:08:42.855 --> 03:08:44.274
MATT: Make an insight check.

03:08:44.274 --> 03:08:47.184
TALIESIN: I'll join this one, as well.

03:08:47.184 --> 03:08:51.374
MARISHA: God fucking bull fucking shit.

03:08:51.374 --> 03:08:53.251
TALIESIN: 25.

03:08:53.251 --> 03:08:54.526
MARISHA: Nine.

03:08:54.526 --> 03:08:56.463
MATT: Hard to read.

03:08:56.463 --> 03:08:57.914
TRAVIS: Doesn't matter.

03:08:57.914 --> 03:09:01.695
LAURA: "Hard to read." Whispers!

03:09:01.695 --> 03:09:05.460
SAM: Hey, how great was New York Comic Con?

03:09:05.460 --> 03:09:06.749
TRAVIS: Boy, sure was fun, Sam.

03:09:06.749 --> 03:09:07.934
SAM: We met a lot of great Critters--

03:09:07.934 --> 03:09:09.161
TRAVIS: We did!

03:09:09.161 --> 03:09:15.124
SAM: And thanks for everyone for coming out to the
live show, and we'll be back again next year? I

03:09:15.124 --> 03:09:17.221
don't know.

03:09:17.221 --> 03:09:23.923
TALIESIN: So I keel over mysteriously dead. Just
kidding! Sorry. No, all right, cool.

03:09:23.923 --> 03:09:26.556
MATT: All right. He darts inside, the rest of you
guys are inside. You close it?

03:09:26.556 --> 03:09:29.023
LAURA: Yes!

03:09:29.023 --> 03:09:30.423
TRAVIS: Yes, we close it, yeah.

03:09:30.423 --> 03:09:33.796
TALIESIN: I'm closing, slowly.

03:09:33.796 --> 03:09:39.570
MATT: All right. As you are just closing it
gently, you can see shapes coming up over one, and

03:09:39.570 --> 03:09:47.463
now a second, side of the temple. There are a few
charging up. All right. It locks from the inside.

03:09:47.463 --> 03:09:49.786
The latch locks behind itself.

03:09:49.786 --> 03:09:50.863
SAM: I locked it!

03:09:50.863 --> 03:09:52.955
TRAVIS: We may not have much time. Darkvision,
what do we see?

03:09:52.955 --> 03:09:54.808
MARISHA: Goggles.

03:09:54.808 --> 03:10:02.353
MATT: You're now standing in a small, five-foot by
eight-foot chamber. You are all cramped in there,

03:10:02.353 --> 03:10:05.345
but there is a spiral staircase that leads down.

03:10:05.345 --> 03:10:07.277
TRAVIS: Time to go.

03:10:07.277 --> 03:10:08.468
SAM: One at a time.

03:10:08.468 --> 03:10:09.201
TRAVIS: You first.

03:10:09.201 --> 03:10:10.028
SAM: Why me?

03:10:10.028 --> 03:10:11.214
TRAVIS: Check. For. Traps.

03:10:11.214 --> 03:10:13.437
LAURA: Whoever I'm standing next to, I grab their
butt.

03:10:13.437 --> 03:10:19.595
TALIESIN: Who's rubbing my elbow? It's weird.

03:10:19.595 --> 03:10:24.161
SAM: I'll take a big swig of liquor and start
going down, scanning for traps.

03:10:24.161 --> 03:10:26.936
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

03:10:26.936 --> 03:10:28.805
LAURA: Avantika! Avantika, are you here?

03:10:28.805 --> 03:10:31.412
SAM: Oh, that's shit. I only rolled an 11.

03:10:31.412 --> 03:10:38.962
MATT: All right. There is a faint noise you hear
that goes, "Do not worry. I was waiting for you up

03:10:38.962 --> 03:10:41.696
"top this entire time."

03:10:41.696 --> 03:10:44.187
LIAM: I'm casting Mage Armor.

03:10:44.187 --> 03:10:48.252
MATT: All right. Mage Armor is on. What'd you
roll?

03:10:48.252 --> 03:10:50.372
SAM: 11 for investigation.

03:10:50.372 --> 03:10:52.013
MATT: Seems safe.

03:10:52.013 --> 03:10:54.700
SAM: Coast is clear! Let's go! (running)

03:10:54.700 --> 03:11:03.791
MATT: Okay. Nott's charging down the stairs, the
rest of you follow suit. The chamber beneath has

03:11:03.791 --> 03:11:09.063
some sort of faint, fiery light source, and it
opens up below you. As you begin to move downward,

03:11:09.063 --> 03:11:14.796
you can see a pentagram-like chamber. Not a
perfect pentagram, but there are five sides to it;

03:11:14.796 --> 03:11:20.288
one that's shorter than the rest that gives this
diamond-shape to the interior of the chamber.

03:11:20.288 --> 03:11:26.366
There are two walls on the sides, and there are
bits of green growth in the corners. In the

03:11:26.366 --> 03:11:32.959
center, there's a raised platform with some sort
of fountain that rests in the middle, and there

03:11:32.959 --> 03:11:40.901
are four figures standing around this fountain.
Which is precisely what you notice as Nott, your

03:11:40.901 --> 03:11:47.050
foot hits one of these steps that (clicks) gives
out from underneath and the stairs suddenly shift

03:11:47.050 --> 03:11:51.180
into a sliding platform.

03:11:51.180 --> 03:11:52.980
SAM: Weee!

03:11:52.980 --> 03:11:54.322
LIAM: How steep?

03:11:54.322 --> 03:11:56.084
MATT: It's about a 45-degree angle.

03:11:56.084 --> 03:11:58.230
LIAM: So how fast does the fall feel?

03:11:58.230 --> 03:12:02.722
MATT: It's only about ten feet, 15 feet down, and
what would have stopped you to catch a moment, you

03:12:02.722 --> 03:12:04.771
all of a sudden (slipping).

03:12:04.771 --> 03:12:06.059
LIAM: So it's not that far down?

03:12:06.059 --> 03:12:09.473
MATT: It's not going to be a hard fall, but any
sense of stealth you would've had, or any sort of

03:12:09.473 --> 03:12:15.335
surprise, is gone, as all of you manage to barely
glide your way to the bottom or stumble on your

03:12:15.335 --> 03:12:22.654
ass, sliding to the bottom of this chamber. There
in the darkened, lit interior chamber, three of

03:12:22.654 --> 03:12:28.383
these figures standing around this fountain,
holding bowls, glance over their shoulders towards

03:12:28.383 --> 03:12:33.037
you and hiss with sharpened snake teeth.

03:12:33.037 --> 03:12:35.746
LAURA: Oh, good, this is the bowl drinking party!
We were looking for it, oof.

03:12:35.746 --> 03:12:43.179
MATT: Behind the fountain, you see one jet
black-gray humanoid body. It's a little larger

03:12:43.179 --> 03:12:49.583
than the others with a giant, extended snake head.
The cobra hood, long and wide on each side. Its

03:12:49.583 --> 03:12:52.395
eyes glowing red from the back.

03:12:52.395 --> 03:12:55.022
LIAM: I begin casting Slow.

03:12:55.022 --> 03:12:56.973
MATT: And we'll get to that next week.

03:12:56.973 --> 03:12:59.371
(shrieks of disappointment)

03:12:59.371 --> 03:13:01.461
MARISHA: Oh my god!

03:13:01.461 --> 03:13:07.777
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! The big black cobra hood, arms
or just the serpentine body?

03:13:07.777 --> 03:13:14.966
MATT: It's a slender humanoid body that's tall and
thin, but its body is gray scaled and armor plates

03:13:14.966 --> 03:13:19.203
and then, from its shoulders, it extends up into
the hooded cobra head.

03:13:19.203 --> 03:13:20.686
TRAVIS: Taller than the other three that were in
the chamber?

03:13:20.686 --> 03:13:23.669
MATT: Yeah, it's probably about seven-foot tall,
and the others are about five-and-a-half, six-foot tall.

03:13:23.669 --> 03:13:27.102
LIAM: Let's skip and go to the next episode!

03:13:27.102 --> 03:13:29.248
MATT: We got a week.

03:13:29.248 --> 03:13:33.056
TRAVIS: Don't we have that little box that appears
that's just counting down from ten, nine, eight,

03:13:33.056 --> 03:13:36.316
and it's going to automatically skip to the fight
right now, right? We can just hit it.

03:13:36.316 --> 03:13:37.762
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:13:37.762 --> 03:13:39.070
MATT: We all got shit to do in the morning.

03:13:39.070 --> 03:13:40.714
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, that's so true.

03:13:40.714 --> 03:13:42.413
TRAVIS: Yeah, but cobra fight!

03:13:42.413 --> 03:13:43.741
MATT: I know. We'll pick it up there next week.

03:13:43.741 --> 03:13:45.020
TALIESIN: Tomorrow's a long day.

03:13:45.020 --> 03:13:45.871
MATT: I know.

03:13:45.871 --> 03:13:47.263
TRAVIS: Good shit, Matt!

03:13:47.263 --> 03:13:50.877
MATT: Now, you guys are in the temple. We'll see
where it goes from here. I'm excited.

03:13:50.877 --> 03:13:55.473
MARISHA: It's so Indiana Jones! This is so Nathan
Drake!

03:13:55.473 --> 03:13:58.416
LAURA: I was like, where are we going to stick the
rubies! Where do we stick their-- I don't know

03:13:58.416 --> 03:14:00.006
where to stick the rubies.

03:14:00.006 --> 03:14:01.429
MARISHA: The rubies have a purpose, I know it!

03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:04.619
LAURA: Look at all these dice that fucked me
tonight!

03:14:04.619 --> 03:14:11.573
MATT: (laughing) That's a t-shirt. Well, thank you
guys. We'll pick this up next week. I'm excited.

03:14:11.573 --> 03:14:16.840
Thank you, guys, for sticking around with us
tonight. Have a good week, we love you, and is it

03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:20.225
Thursday yet? Good night!

03:14:27.274 --> 03:25:52.529

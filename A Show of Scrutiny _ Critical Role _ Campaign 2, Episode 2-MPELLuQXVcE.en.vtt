00:00:00.432 --> 00:00:03.662
MATT: And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.662 --> 00:00:05.641
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:08.258
TRAVIS: Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.736
MATT: Or that. We also do that, I guess.

00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:13.641
TALIESIN: That's the same embarrassment that you
feel about us; the way we're feeling about you now.

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.810
MATT: What the fuck was that?!

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.958
SAM: Where we play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:25.793
MATT: Oh my god. Welcome. We're already loopy,
what could possibly go wrong? So yes, welcome!

00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:28.846
Before we jump into tonight's game, we have some
announcements to get through real fast so hold

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:33.484
tight for just a moment. First and foremost,
continuing tonight's sponsorship with our friends

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:41.054
at D&amp;D Beyond. Our now long-term partner. We're
super excited to be working with them for the

00:00:41.054 --> 00:00:44.456
foreseeable future for the time being with the
show. Sam, you have some words, I believe.

00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:49.426
SAM: To plug our good friends at D&amp;D Beyond, I
need my fellow castmates to help me. Can we

00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:51.470
practice? Can you all say, "Boo"?

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.047
ALL: Boo!

00:00:53.047 --> 00:00:54.429
SAM: Can you all say, "Yay"?

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.788
ALL: Yay!

00:00:55.788 --> 00:01:00.199
SAM: Okay, the official digital toolset for
Critical Role is D&amp;D Beyond.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.755
ALL: Yay!

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:06.377
SAM: A great service to organize everything D&amp;D.
Rules, spells, character sheets, and more, all

00:01:06.377 --> 00:01:08.178
with a pesky pen and paper?

00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:10.195
ALL: Boo!

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:14.847
SAM: No! You can access it digitally on your
computer, mobile, or tablet.

00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:16.797
ALL: Yay!

00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:21.484
SAM: The cast is using D&amp;D Beyond every week,
except for Taliesin.

00:01:21.484 --> 00:01:23.207
ALL: Boo!

00:01:23.207 --> 00:01:24.708
SAM: Just kidding, he is!

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:26.428
ALL: Yay!

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:34.583
SAM: I have to use both the boo and the yay or
else it doesn't make sense. He can do cool stuff

00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:39.201
like activate Critical Role content in his
character builder and create a blood hunter.

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:40.740
ALL: Yay!

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.197
SAM: And do you think they charge an arm and a
leg?

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:45.134
ALL: Boo!

00:01:45.134 --> 00:01:47.518
SAM: No, they don't!

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:49.821
ALL: Yay!

00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:54.851
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond is offering a discount of $10 off
any digital book in their shop. Use code

00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:57.016
"beginnings" at checkout.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.610
ALL: Yay!

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.733
SAM: So check them out at dndbeyond.com. Is that D
&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; D Beyond?

00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:04.034
ALL: Boo!

00:02:04.034 --> 00:02:07.012
SAM: No, is that D-N-D Beyond?

00:02:07.084 --> 00:02:08.398
ALL: Yay!

00:02:08.398 --> 00:02:10.650
SAM: And this spot was written by Sam Riegel.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.000
ALL: Boo!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.732
(laughter)

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:21.880
MATT: Thank you so much, Sam. And thank you, D&amp;D
Beyond, for being our partners for this new

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.306
campaign.

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:25.438
LAURA: Marisha, you yay'ed, good for you!

00:02:25.438 --> 00:02:30.866
MARISHA: I did! It was a little complacent, but I
yay'ed. I gave him one.

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:40.932
MATT: Oh man. Talks Machina, of course, our after
talk show about this episode will be on next

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:46.205
Tuesday, as it is every Tuesday, after the show at
7:00pm Pacific here on Twitch and Project Alpha,

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:50.018
with our host Brian W. Foster. (burp) I always
burp when I say his name. I wonder what that says

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:52.019
about him. I don't know why.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.912
LAURA: It's that cabbage smell.

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:57.919
MATT: It's the cabbage. So check that out. Merch,
Laura.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:04.949
LAURA: So, you know, we talked about those posters
last week. They're still in the store on

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:12.081
pre-order. Some of them are getting shipped out
right now, so you should be getting them soon.

00:03:12.081 --> 00:03:14.096
ALL: Yay!

00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:18.562
LAURA: We're going to leave them on pre-order
until Monday night, so if you're watching this on

00:03:18.562 --> 00:03:23.472
YouTube after it's been aired live, you've got until
midnight to put in that order.

00:03:23.472 --> 00:03:25.249
ALL: Yay.

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:29.352
LAURA: Then they're going to be gone. Well, we
might have a small overage that remains in the

00:03:29.352 --> 00:03:34.547
store. But the pre-orders will be done. You know
what I mean. And then hey, check out that other

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:42.657
stuff like shirts, hats, and dice. We should be
getting some more Vox Machina d20s. I know a lot

00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:46.387
of people have been asking about them. They're
going to be restocked, hopefully within the next week.

00:03:46.462 --> 00:03:49.970
More will be coming soon if those sell out. You
know how it goes.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:59.511
MATT: Great, thank you, Laura. Podcast. Episode
one of this campaign is already up. So those of

00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:02.593
you following in podcast form or have friends who
have been waiting to listen to the podcast on

00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:09.020
their commute; it is available, the first episode.
Every Thursday morning, we'll have the episode of

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.557
the previous week available and we'll be keeping
those up consistently as the campaign progresses,

00:04:12.557 --> 00:04:18.874
and we also have the entire story of Vox Machina
currently available on podcast. Makes me happy.

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:27.066
Once again, we are firmly in support of our
longtime charity partners, 826LA. They do awesome

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:31.743
work teaching creative writing classes for
children who normally wouldn't have the

00:04:31.743 --> 00:04:37.558
opportunity to get involved. They do phenomenal
work. I recommend that you research them and if

00:04:37.558 --> 00:04:42.688
you can, either help with a donation or actually,
you can donate your time as well to help teach and

00:04:42.688 --> 00:04:45.569
be part of the program if one is near you. Go
check it out.

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:51.371
MARISHA: We were talking to one of the heads at
826LA over the break, Joel, and he was saying that

00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:59.039
they would love to do D&amp;D, but no one on their
staff knows how to DM or do D&amp;D. So if there's an

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.917
826 in your area, and you're like, "I know, I'll
start a D&amp;D club," I'm sure they'll be open to it,

00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:06.951
just go talk to them and go teach kids D&amp;D!

00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:11.164
MATT: Yeah. Run a game for a bunch of cool
teenagers and show them how awesome this game is.

00:05:11.164 --> 00:05:14.091
MARISHA: Or cool eight-year-olds who are equally
as amazing.

00:05:14.091 --> 00:05:16.676
SAM: Or dorky eight-year-olds or teenagers.

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:18.579
MATT: Those are the same, Sam.

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:20.495
MARISHA: Nerd is chic now.

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:27.572
MATT: I like to think I was always cool. No, it's
not true at all. I'm still trying to get there.

00:05:27.572 --> 00:05:33.691
All right, cool! Appearances. Laura and Travis
will be at Emerald City Comic Con in Seattle,

00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:38.681
March 2nd to the 4th. If you're up in that area,
go over and say hi to them. I will be at Lexington

00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:45.496
Comic and Toy Con in Lexington, Kentucky March 9th
to the 11th. As well as Otafest in Calgary up in

00:05:45.496 --> 00:05:50.092
Canada, May 18th to the 20th, and Akon in Texas,
June 7th to the 10th.

00:05:50.092 --> 00:05:53.528
SAM: Calgary is like the Kentucky of Canada.

00:05:53.528 --> 00:05:55.060
LAURA: Is it?

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.583
SAM: I don't know.

00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:58.792
MARISHA: I'll take that as a compliment.

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:05.814
LIAM: I am also going to Bak-Anime, not to be
confused with SacAnime, on February 3rd and 4th.

00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:07.646
TRAVIS: How do you spell that, B-A-K?

00:06:07.646 --> 00:06:09.966
LIAM: B-A-K, that's real soon. So I'll be there.

00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:13.825
MATT: Beautiful. And I believe--

00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:20.583
LIAM: Wait! Comic book next week. Issue four.
Comic book.

00:06:20.583 --> 00:06:23.690
MATT: Issue four on the 24th, I believe it is?

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.054
TALIESIN: By far the most fourth of all of these
books. It's easily the most fourth.

00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:31.537
TRAVIS: Like the blue hair.

00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:35.302
TALIESIN: Thank you, this is new. Just went for
this, it's going to slowly darken over time.

00:06:35.302 --> 00:06:37.525
MATT: Into pure shadow.

00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:43.202
TALIESIN: It's going to be keyframed and
photoshopped, I'm aware.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:47.162
MATT: The invitation is there, folks. Screencap and
photoshop away.

00:06:47.162 --> 00:06:50.011
TALIESIN: I've already been told that's it's going
to happen.

00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:56.901
MATT: On that note, that concludes our
announcements, thank you for your patience. And I

00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:04.323
believe it's time for us to begin tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:08:26.104
[80s music]

00:08:26.104 --> 00:08:35.740
MATT: And welcome back. Last we left off, our
slowly gathering band of adventurers had begun to

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.613
have their stories intertwine in the city of
Trostenwald, on the southern reaches of western

00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:46.906
Wynandir on the continent of Wildemount. Here we
had Nott and Caleb who had been traveling

00:08:46.906 --> 00:08:53.160
southward coming and meeting, in the center of the
tavern, the Nestled Nook Inn, with Jester,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:09:01.858
Beauregard, and Fjord. They were invited to a
nearby carnival that had begun preparing for their

00:09:01.858 --> 00:09:09.368
performance later that evening, in which they met
Yasha and Molly. After swapping some stories,

00:09:09.368 --> 00:09:17.101
earning and losing some gold, they began to gather
at the outskirts of the Ustaloch, the lake right

00:09:17.177 --> 00:09:22.674
on the eastern edge of Trostenwald, for the first
opening performance of the Fletching and Moondrop

00:09:22.674 --> 00:09:25.160
Carnival of Curiosities.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.064
TALIESIN: Traveling Carnival of Curiosities.

00:09:27.064 --> 00:09:35.230
MATT: Upon entering the tent, they saw a number of
performances. However, during a musical performance

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:41.738
by this young dwarven girl whose voice was this
mysterious, magically enchanting experience, a

00:09:41.738 --> 00:09:51.043
member of the audience rose up and began to
transform into a terrible undead creature that

00:09:51.043 --> 00:09:55.365
began to lash out, killing another member of the
audience, who then began to become one of these

00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:59.709
same creatures. You all, grabbing your weapons
from Yasha, who had been keeping them stashed

00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:04.801
away, leapt into the fray, slaughtered both of
these terrible beasts, just in time for the

00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:12.112
crownsguard to rush in and ask you what the hell
happened. After information had been gathered of

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:19.308
who was immediately available and responsible for
this carnival, Gustav, Bo the Breaker, and Molly

00:10:19.308 --> 00:10:24.211
were marked to be arrested. One of the guards was
escorted outside of the tent by Yasha, who was

00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:30.124
going to show him where this young dwarven girl
was currently resting, and upon being led astray

00:10:30.124 --> 00:10:36.764
to the wrong tent, she just ran into the distant
hills and vanished. And that is where we left off.

00:10:36.764 --> 00:10:39.332
SAM: So we're still at the carnival?

00:10:39.332 --> 00:10:40.924
MATT: You're still in the tent.

00:10:40.924 --> 00:10:42.175
LIAM: With crownsguard?

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:52.085
MATT: With the crownsguard and with Watchmaster
Jossyd. The crownsguard that had left naught but a

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:58.412
moment before comes rushing in, his breath
huffing, sweat dripping from his brow, his eyes

00:10:58.412 --> 00:11:07.281
wild. He goes, "Watchmaster! The big woman is
gone! She's gone!" The Watchmaster turns to him

00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:14.254
and says, "You three, go with him. Search for
her." They all immediately run out back out the

00:11:14.254 --> 00:11:19.189
performer's flap and he turns to the rest of you
in the group, "Shackle and drag those three down

00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:26.016
"to the stockade." About five guards approach and
begin to press Gustav, Bo, and Molly to the ground

00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:28.151
and begin to put chains and shackles on them.

00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:32.372
TALIESIN: I'd like to make a counteroffer?

00:11:32.372 --> 00:11:43.589
MATT: He's in mid-speech, "The rest of you keep an
eye on the performers here. Ask around, see what

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:48.009
"you can find. As for the others, don't go far."

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:50.256
LAURA: The innocent patrons, you mean?

00:11:50.256 --> 00:11:55.537
MATT: "You may be innocent, in which case you have
nothing to worry about. However, we have an

00:11:55.537 --> 00:12:02.274
"investigation to complete, so I would ask that you
stay in the city and wait until you are called in.

00:12:02.274 --> 00:12:06.399
"You will be questioned, and when this
investigation is completed, regardless of how long

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:09.012
"it may take, you are not to leave Trostenwald."

00:12:09.012 --> 00:12:14.707
LIAM: If I could just contribute one word, the 40
or so people who are outside and the rest of us

00:12:14.707 --> 00:12:22.054
will vouch for this one, the colorful one. He
saved many people's lives. Don't take my word for

00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:24.140
it. There's everyone outside.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.765
MATT: All the rest of the crownsguard glance to
each other, he goes, "Well, unfortunately, that is

00:12:30.765 --> 00:12:36.537
"not for me to decide. The Lawmaster would have to
be appealed to. If you wish to come with us, we

00:12:36.537 --> 00:12:41.306
"can bring you along with us to the stockade and
you can speak with her. Then, perhaps, she may

00:12:41.306 --> 00:12:44.244
"grant you leniency, but I can give you no
guarantee."

00:12:44.244 --> 00:12:51.971
MARISHA: Why don't you just question us right now?
I'm confused on why you don't just do that now.

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:58.104
MATT: "Well, we could do that instead. We'll
have you arrested, put you in the stockade as we

00:12:58.104 --> 00:12:59.503
"question the rest of you."

00:12:59.503 --> 00:13:01.615
LAURA: No, let's go to the stockade.

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:03.723
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll all be in one place.

00:13:03.723 --> 00:13:05.237
LAURA: Yeah.

00:13:05.237 --> 00:13:12.378
MARISHA: Jails are not my favored terrain. Just
want to point that out. Not this go-around. No.

00:13:12.378 --> 00:13:14.161
TRAVIS: Good to know.

00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:16.324
LAURA: I would have guessed that about you.

00:13:16.324 --> 00:13:20.413
MARISHA: Not really comfortable with that.

00:13:20.413 --> 00:13:28.450
MATT: "We're leaving. The rest of you, stay in here.
Watch over the performers. Make sure nobody

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:35.210
"leaves. Come if you wish. Otherwise, we'll be in
touch." The Watchmaster gathers alongside the

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.942
other five crownsguard, lifting up the shackles of
the three that had been arrested and begin to drag

00:13:38.942 --> 00:13:41.169
them outside of the tent and into the night air.

00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:42.948
LIAM: I send Frumpkin to follow.

00:13:42.948 --> 00:13:44.233
MATT: Okay.

00:13:44.233 --> 00:13:49.086
MARISHA: Can I double back into the performance
area and see if I can find that little girl that

00:13:49.086 --> 00:13:51.154
they're looking for? Before they do?

00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:54.943
MATT: You may, if you want to. So you send
Frumpkin just to follow them. You guys are staying

00:13:54.943 --> 00:13:56.389
behind, then?

00:13:56.389 --> 00:14:01.737
TRAVIS: Are there three regular crownsguard that
are going with Molly? Or is the Watchmaster going

00:14:01.737 --> 00:14:03.039
with them as well?

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:06.086
MATT: The Watchmaster is going with them, or at
least he's exiting the tent with them. It looks

00:14:06.086 --> 00:14:08.816
like there are five crownsguard attending the three
of them that are shackled.

00:14:08.816 --> 00:14:13.436
TRAVIS: I'll go out the front exit of the tent
just to see if the Watchmaster goes with Molly.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:14.855
MATT: Okay.

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:16.146
LAURA: I'll follow Fjord.

00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:21.561
MATT: Okay, so the two of you are following.
Anybody with them? Currently, it's you two and

00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:22.997
Frumpkin.

00:14:22.997 --> 00:14:28.632
SAM: Are we going with them or not? Should we stay
here? This is not our affair, right?

00:14:28.632 --> 00:14:33.112
LIAM: I don't know. I'm having second thoughts
about being here at all.

00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:35.924
SAM: Well, you sent the kitty, didn't you?

00:14:35.924 --> 00:14:40.586
LIAM: Yes, and we're not going to leave without
him. Why don't we just--?

00:14:40.586 --> 00:14:42.746
SAM: Follow behind a bit?

00:14:42.746 --> 00:14:44.227
LIAM: That's right.

00:14:44.227 --> 00:14:47.717
SAM: Okay. Sounds good.

00:14:47.717 --> 00:14:57.508
MATT: All right, so as you guys exit, keeping
a pace behind, watching the

00:14:57.586 --> 00:15:04.755
crownsguard guiding the current prisoners towards
the actual city, Frumpkin keeping a zig-zagging

00:15:04.755 --> 00:15:06.477
distance behind and following.

00:15:06.477 --> 00:15:07.534
LIAM: DM?

00:15:07.534 --> 00:15:08.331
MATT: Yes?

00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:16.357
LIAM: Is it possible for me, if Nott is holding my
hand and leading me, to go full third eye and walk

00:15:16.357 --> 00:15:20.768
blind and deaf here looking through Frumpkin's
senses?

00:15:20.768 --> 00:15:25.334
MATT: I would say yes, but you are purely like--
because all you're doing is walking forward and

00:15:25.334 --> 00:15:26.526
you need someone to guide you.

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:27.413
LIAM: Right.

00:15:27.413 --> 00:15:29.161
SAM: And he can't communicate to me either so--

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:35.650
LIAM: I can talk, but I can't hear you. I can talk
and hold her hand so she can stop me from

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.484
prat-falling all over myself.

00:15:37.484 --> 00:15:39.095
SAM: Yes. But you can talk?

00:15:39.095 --> 00:15:41.090
MATT: He can talk but he can't hear you.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.580
SAM: Got it. Okay. Great.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:48.866
LIAM: But we've done this before so you know to
squeeze my hand really hard if I should pipe down.

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:50.373
SAM: Sure.

00:15:50.373 --> 00:15:53.140
MATT: All right. So, first off, Beauregard.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.187
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:15:54.187 --> 00:16:00.488
MATT: As you back out of the performer's exit of
the tent into the center of their encampment, the

00:16:00.488 --> 00:16:08.121
immediate exit, there are already four crownsguard
currently searching around and setting up a watch

00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:11.275
perimeter around the different tents. They're
gathering and making sure none of the other

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:16.003
performers have fled and a lot of them are being
brought out into an area where there's a number of

00:16:16.003 --> 00:16:19.713
tents all facing towards a large campfire in the
center. There's a couple of chairs set up there,

00:16:19.713 --> 00:16:23.914
it's kind of the common area for the performers of
the carnival and it looks like they're all being

00:16:23.914 --> 00:16:27.147
put out there so they can get a bead on it and
make sure they know where everyone else is.

00:16:27.147 --> 00:16:34.815
MARISHA: I'm going to try to be aloof, stealth a
little bit. I don't want to make myself completely known.

00:16:34.815 --> 00:16:38.705
MATT: Are you trying to stealth out of sight or
just trying to not draw attention?

00:16:38.705 --> 00:16:40.630
MARISHA: No, just trying not to draw attention.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.682
MATT: Okay, all right. Go and make a stealth check
just to see if--

00:16:45.682 --> 00:16:48.232
SAM: Wait, did we just all ditch Marisha?

00:16:48.232 --> 00:16:49.706
LAURA: She just walked out.

00:16:49.706 --> 00:16:59.274
MARISHA: I ditched you. That's cocked. That's
better. 17.

00:16:59.274 --> 00:17:06.059
MATT: 17. Okay. As you kind of dart through the
flap of the tent and move behind one of the large

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:12.758
carts that currently is still affixed to a horse
that is currently just chewing on an apple, and

00:17:12.758 --> 00:17:16.484
you hear the crunch in its teeth, you glance over
past the edge of the immediate near tent and you

00:17:16.484 --> 00:17:20.624
can see this group gathering there and it appears
that no one's immediately aware of your presence.

00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:24.737
MARISHA: Do I see the little girl whose name was--
what was her name?

00:17:24.737 --> 00:17:30.562
MATT: Toya. You do not see her yet. The guard just
got out there and they're just beginning to pull

00:17:30.562 --> 00:17:41.022
people out. You do see the fire dancer brought out
there. You then see the two-- Yeah, Ornna. The

00:17:41.022 --> 00:17:45.383
Knot sisters are brought out and pushed out there
and they're all looking very frustrated.

00:17:45.383 --> 00:17:46.874
MARISHA: Are people being amicable?

00:17:46.874 --> 00:17:50.717
MATT: Yeah, they're not shoving them around,
they're just calling them out to the front so they

00:17:50.717 --> 00:17:52.072
know where they are.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:57.157
MARISHA: Okay. I want to look around. Do I see any
type of movement in the shadows, anyone looking

00:17:57.157 --> 00:17:58.399
suspicious?

00:17:58.399 --> 00:18:00.281
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:06.805
MARISHA: Ooh yeah! Natural 18. 21.

00:18:06.805 --> 00:18:15.524
MATT: 21. Okay, as you glance about, you don't see
anything lurking in the shadows. What you do

00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:23.705
notice, though, is one of them bring Toya out of
one of the-- the tent that's on the southern side and

00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:31.288
as he brings her out, there's a heavy thud sound,
and you see coming out from behind the tent the

00:18:31.288 --> 00:18:37.706
large form of-- you heard the name Kylre once, but
the ''devil toad." The obese lizard man who's

00:18:37.706 --> 00:18:39.470
stomping up behind.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.967
LAURA: Is he a dude or is he a creature?

00:18:41.967 --> 00:18:51.291
MATT: It looks like a lizard man, so scaled,
humanoid, but extremely thick, bulbous belly,

00:18:51.291 --> 00:18:52.829
large, almost frog-like legs--

00:18:52.829 --> 00:18:57.638
TRAVIS: Bipedal or on all fours?

00:18:57.638 --> 00:19:03.428
MATT: Due to the size of his form, mostly all
fours and lumbering forward on all of them but

00:19:03.428 --> 00:19:06.684
sits back on a bipedal situation.

00:19:06.684 --> 00:19:08.686
MARISHA: So they're bringing the both of them out?

00:19:08.686 --> 00:19:14.751
MATT: The toad is hiding behind the tent and as
soon as Toya comes out, comes up to the guard and

00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:21.113
puffs up its chest. The guard spins around and
goes for the blade and pulls it out just carefully.

00:19:21.113 --> 00:19:23.439
MARISHA: Am I still next to that horse?

00:19:23.439 --> 00:19:31.769
MATT: The horse is currently still up on the cart,
but is about 30 feet from you.

00:19:35.193 --> 00:19:37.384
SAM: Beast Shape!

00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:40.434
(laughter)

00:19:40.486 --> 00:19:48.441
MARISHA: I'm going to take my staff and give a
really nice whack to the horse to get it to run.

00:19:48.441 --> 00:19:51.782
MATT: You know what? Let's go ahead and make an
animal handling check on that.

00:19:51.782 --> 00:19:53.720
SAM: We never get to make those!

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.779
LIAM: First of the show!

00:19:55.779 --> 00:20:01.033
MARISHA: Oh my god, I'm so nervous right now.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.621
TRAVIS: You're good, you're good, you're good.

00:20:02.621 --> 00:20:05.127
MARISHA: That's not great. 11?

00:20:05.127 --> 00:20:09.703
MATT: 11 will do. It wasn't a hard DC, but it was
more knowing where to hit it to where it would

00:20:09.703 --> 00:20:12.234
cause it to bolt versus just get angry.

00:20:12.234 --> 00:20:14.105
MARISHA: Get pissed, sure, kick me.

00:20:14.105 --> 00:20:20.149
MATT: So going for-- not to actually hurt the
creature but just enough to spook it, you hit it

00:20:20.206 --> 00:20:24.169
in the right place towards the back of its
hindquarters to cause it to suddenly rear up

00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:29.697
(neighs) (cart clattering noise) and go into a
sprint. The cart begins to bounce and smash onto

00:20:29.697 --> 00:20:33.636
the ground. You can see the wheels clattering into
the rocks and the stone between the bits of--

00:20:33.636 --> 00:20:38.401
MARISHA: I'm going to bolt in the opposite direction and
try and loop around to the south side of the tent.

00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:39.856
MATT: Make another stealth check, please.

00:20:39.856 --> 00:20:45.156
MARISHA: Big dice, big dice. Okay, 19!

00:20:45.156 --> 00:20:53.114
MATT: Okay. You dart around the north side of
these tents and you're pretty sure you weren't

00:20:53.114 --> 00:20:59.762
seen. As the cart begins to bolt off behind this
horse, you see all the crownsguard turn. The one

00:20:59.762 --> 00:21:03.947
that was currently staring at the devil toad
glances off to the side. As he glances off, the

00:21:03.947 --> 00:21:09.932
devil toad takes Toya and just pulls her to him
protectively and the guard puts his sword away.

00:21:09.932 --> 00:21:16.578
"Check!" Points to them and then bolts off to go
after the horse. The other three stay, watching

00:21:16.578 --> 00:21:17.862
over the group.

00:21:17.862 --> 00:21:19.770
MARISHA: Okay, can I loop around, kind of come up
behind them?

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.968
MATT: I mean, they're scattered a bit but
there's--

00:21:21.968 --> 00:21:23.637
MARISHA: The devil toad and Toya.

00:21:23.637 --> 00:21:27.835
MATT: Oh yeah. Make another stealth check. You're
running through open areas each time you're doing this.

00:21:27.835 --> 00:21:37.507
MARISHA: Yep. (yells) Did you see that?! It leaned
to a four. Ten.

00:21:37.507 --> 00:21:39.323
TRAVIS: That is a bastard die right there.

00:21:39.323 --> 00:21:40.357
MARISHA: That sucked.

00:21:40.357 --> 00:21:41.580
TRAVIS: That's a tease.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.232
MARISHA: Laura, put him in the dice jail.

00:21:43.232 --> 00:21:47.494
LAURA: I don't have my dice jail out yet. It's
okay, he'll chill there.

00:21:47.494 --> 00:21:53.386
MATT: As you come up around the back of the devil
toad, the guard that runs past doesn't immediately

00:21:53.386 --> 00:21:58.008
notice you because he's focused on where this cart
is running off and you can see another guard that

00:21:58.008 --> 00:22:02.243
was far away from this encampment that's circling
back with him. The two of them are now bolting in

00:22:02.243 --> 00:22:05.954
the direction as the cart begins to slow. It's not
just going forward forever but it spooked him and

00:22:05.954 --> 00:22:09.634
it's starting to slow down. They're just going to
inspect it. However, as you slink up behind, the

00:22:09.634 --> 00:22:16.123
devil toad's head curls back towards you and you
hear this deep, guttural (growls).

00:22:16.123 --> 00:22:24.235
MARISHA: "Okay. It's okay. Toya?" And I look at
Toya. "Hey, come on, let's get out of here, let's go."

00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:28.315
MATT: At which point a voice says, "Excuse me?!"

00:22:28.315 --> 00:22:32.787
And you can see the three guards are there
staring at you.

00:22:32.787 --> 00:22:35.969
MARISHA: Fuck. You didn't say there were fucking
guards.

00:22:35.969 --> 00:22:39.551
MATT: I did say there were three guards. The three
guards watching them.

00:22:39.551 --> 00:22:41.571
MARISHA: I thought you said they left.

00:22:41.571 --> 00:22:43.007
MATT: One of them left.

00:22:43.007 --> 00:22:45.806
MARISHA: One of them left. So wait. Oh shit.

00:22:45.806 --> 00:22:50.322
MATT: It's a bad stealth check, I'm sorry. But
there's now three crownsguard right there and

00:22:50.322 --> 00:22:52.165
they're like, "Can I help you?"

00:22:52.165 --> 00:22:53.685
TRAVIS: Time to go to jail.

00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:56.255
LAURA: Oh, this is so exciting.

00:22:56.255 --> 00:22:58.769
SAM: Kill them all.

00:22:58.769 --> 00:23:05.517
MARISHA: Ey! I was actually just looking for the
loo?

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:13.272
MATT: The guard that's closest to you glances to
the other guys and goes, "She was with the group,

00:23:13.272 --> 00:23:20.894
"right?" They recognize you, and they look at each
other. "You're going to the stockade, my dear."

00:23:20.894 --> 00:23:23.366
MARISHA: No!

00:23:23.366 --> 00:23:28.264
MATT: The three guards slowly approach and they
begin to take out chains and manacle you up.

00:23:28.264 --> 00:23:33.286
SAM: In an effort not to go to jail, you went &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt;
the jail.

00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:37.609
MARISHA: I'm trying to get the girl. I was trying
to free the damn girl.

00:23:37.609 --> 00:23:39.062
MATT: I know.

00:23:39.062 --> 00:23:42.106
TALIESIN: You'll be fine.

00:23:42.106 --> 00:23:47.211
MATT: So you're shackled and begin to be dragged
toward the stockade.

00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:51.335
MARISHA: It's just the two guards, right?

00:23:51.335 --> 00:23:55.019
MATT: It's the two guards now. As you're being
brought back, you can see more guards are coming

00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:59.179
from the city to the carnival. They're keeping it
under surveillance.

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:00.964
MARISHA: So are they taking me away?

00:24:00.964 --> 00:24:02.455
MATT: They're taking you to the city, yeah.

00:24:02.455 --> 00:24:04.622
MARISHA: What are they doing with Toya? Anything?
Are they leaving them behind?

00:24:04.622 --> 00:24:07.612
MATT: They're leaving them behind currently with
the guards that are there. They're not arresting

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:13.615
anybody from the carnival, but they're not letting
them leave. But they're keeping them there.

00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:21.618
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do a quick--

00:24:21.618 --> 00:24:23.165
SAM: Kill them all.

00:24:23.165 --> 00:24:24.943
MARISHA: I'm in shackles?

00:24:24.943 --> 00:24:26.218
MATT: You are.

00:24:26.218 --> 00:24:31.726
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do some monk shit
here. I'm going to elbow one of the guards. Right

00:24:31.726 --> 00:24:36.899
in the ribs. And take the other one and bash the
other one in the face and then I'm going to turn

00:24:36.899 --> 00:24:41.375
to Toya and I'm going to say, "Run! Run! Go! Run!"

00:24:41.375 --> 00:24:45.216
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and--

00:24:45.216 --> 00:24:47.020
SAM: Make all kinds of rolls.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.950
MATT: First, go ahead and make an athletics check.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:54.936
MARISHA and SAM: This is a terrible idea.

00:24:54.936 --> 00:25:01.417
LAURA: To not drag any attention towards her, you
are completely shoving her into the limelight.

00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:08.592
MARISHA: Trying to distract these fucking
assholes. That is a six. Ten.

00:25:08.592 --> 00:25:17.933
MATT: As you go back to elbow, you get halfway
there before your chains go taut. They're both

00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:22.631
holding the chain at each side, and you see the
tension of it; you can't even get him from behind.

00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:27.854
You imagine in your head; you go over it two or
three times. As you go through the first step--

00:25:27.854 --> 00:25:30.086
(grunt) doesn't go anywhere.

00:25:30.086 --> 00:25:31.988
TRAVIS: Tried to do the Sherlock Holmes.

00:25:31.988 --> 00:25:37.409
MARISHA: Do I at least get the "Run!" out to
Toya?

00:25:37.409 --> 00:25:40.590
MATT: No. I'm sorry.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:44.089
MARISHA: Is she just standing there? Waiting for a
guard?

00:25:44.089 --> 00:25:46.863
TRAVIS: She sees you having a seizure in the
chains.

00:25:46.863 --> 00:25:49.207
(laughter)

00:25:49.207 --> 00:25:55.056
MARISHA: What is she doing? Is she running?

00:25:55.056 --> 00:26:01.691
MATT: No. Honestly, the devil toad and her seem
pretty close. He is grabbing her in a protective manner.

00:26:01.691 --> 00:26:10.433
MARISHA: No, they can both run. Run for your life!
Fine, whatever. She wants to get arrested at this point.

00:26:10.433 --> 00:26:15.873
MATT: Two bad rolls in a row. I know. Level two.

00:26:15.873 --> 00:26:18.526
MARISHA: I go join my friends.

00:26:18.526 --> 00:26:29.219
MATT: You will shortly. Ahead of her, along the
way, Gustav is just quiet. Bo the Breaker, Bosun,

00:26:29.219 --> 00:26:36.344
as you know him by his full name, is grumbling
under his breath and is trying to out-loud piece

00:26:36.344 --> 00:26:43.445
together thoughts on what may have what
transpired, saying things like, "I don't know, you

00:26:43.445 --> 00:26:48.687
"think it's done on the inside? Or is this somebody
trying to sabotage it?"

00:26:48.687 --> 00:26:52.015
TALIESIN: I think maybe it has nothing to do with
us. I think maybe we were just caught in the crossfire.

00:26:52.015 --> 00:26:53.796
MATT: It is quite possible.

00:26:53.796 --> 00:26:57.383
TALIESIN: Sorry, sir. Trying to keep my mouth
shut.

00:26:57.383 --> 00:27:02.484
MATT: One of the guards tugs on both of your
chains and says, "Quiet now! Save it for the

00:27:02.484 --> 00:27:10.029
"lawmaster." They bring you in-- you go in through
the Lochward into the Hillsward, which is the

00:27:10.102 --> 00:27:13.300
southern portion of Trostenwald. You are brought
to the outside of the stockade, which is a large

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:21.560
single-story, tall, rectangular building of large
stones and masonry. It's built for function. It's

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.564
not a very beautiful building, but it's
defensible and it seems fairly well-made. However,

00:27:27.564 --> 00:27:31.109
there are the banners of the crownsguard marking
the double-door entrance. As you're brought

00:27:31.196 --> 00:27:35.909
within, you can already see there are two central
chairs where two current watch sit, just watching

00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:43.061
the front door. Beyond the right, you see, is an
office that you guys are dragged to-- and the rest

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:48.220
of you eventually catch up to the group. You are all
brought inside this darkened office. Inside,

00:27:48.297 --> 00:27:55.162
relatively simple. This isn't a library-type study
office. This is very much for function. There's a

00:27:55.162 --> 00:28:00.301
couple of small crates that contain materials that
are too far in shadow to see the details of it.

00:28:00.301 --> 00:28:03.955
Look to be pieces of paper, probably gathered
evidence or weapons that have been reclaimed.

00:28:03.955 --> 00:28:13.280
There is a stone desk on the far end, and there,
within this office, already accompanied by a

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.952
messenger dressed for immediate travel, is a tough-looking 
dwarven woman in her middle years rapidly

00:28:18.952 --> 00:28:23.602
scrawling on parchment. Her black hair is streaked
with silver, tumbling past her red and gray

00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:27.101
leather armor. She finishes writing on this
parchment, rolls it up, and hands it to the

00:28:27.101 --> 00:28:32.469
messenger who immediately darts out of the room
without a word past you guys, giving you a brief

00:28:32.469 --> 00:28:37.176
look as he continues on whatever his business is.
As soon as your eyes pass off the messenger, you

00:28:37.176 --> 00:28:42.649
hear a loud slam, and you glance back. She's put
her hands on the table. She glances up, "All

00:28:42.719 --> 00:28:51.381
"right, what riff-raff have you brought in to me
this day?" The watchmaster takes the chains of the

00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:59.338
three of you and pulls you to the front of the
group and says, "Sorry to be a bother, but we have

00:28:59.338 --> 00:29:04.464
"three individuals arrested in connection with, as
you have heard so far, the deaths at the carnival

00:29:04.464 --> 00:29:12.834
"performance this evening." She rolls her eyes.
"All right, bring them forward." They go ahead and

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:19.773
pull the chains up. The watchmaster bows his head
and then leaves the room. She steps forward and

00:29:19.773 --> 00:29:30.601
goes, "I am Norda. It is my job to keep this city
safe and keep shite like what happened tonight

00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:37.995
"from happening. I approved your second time on the
outskirts of our town and you have killed two of

00:29:37.995 --> 00:29:42.421
"my people. What have you to say about yourselves?"

00:29:42.421 --> 00:29:45.865
TALIESIN: Exactly how did we kill them, exactly?

00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:55.394
MATT: She glances over at you. Glances over at
Gustav, "I have been told by my guard that you

00:29:55.394 --> 00:30:01.372
"gave performance, and as part of this performance
you released two beasts into the midst of the

00:30:01.372 --> 00:30:03.169
"population."

00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:07.965
LAURA: Well, technically, he wasn't part of the
performance, technically he was saving everyone.

00:30:07.965 --> 00:30:09.518
Technically.

00:30:09.518 --> 00:30:14.673
TALIESIN: Thank you. Yes, you see--

00:30:14.673 --> 00:30:20.912
MATT: Gustav interrupts you and says, "I'm so
sorry, my liege. Please, I take full

00:30:21.138 --> 00:30:25.810
"responsibility for what happened this evening on
myself. These people around me had nothing to do

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:32.306
"with this. They are not part of the carnival, they
were just merely helping. It is my carnival, and

00:30:32.306 --> 00:30:37.005
"whatever judgement there lies, I take upon myself
and my head." At which point Bo the half-orc steps

00:30:37.005 --> 00:30:42.713
forward, against his chains and goes, "Gustav,
what are you doing?" He's like, "Shut. Up. Please,

00:30:42.713 --> 00:30:52.089
whatever judgement there is, put it upon me," and
he bows his head low. "Is that the case? Is he the

00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:59.283
"only one?" She takes a good, hard look at you and
Bo the Breaker.

00:31:04.307 --> 00:31:08.562
TALIESIN: Oh, are you waiting for me to speak?
Yes, he's the only one.

00:31:08.562 --> 00:31:10.350
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:31:12.063 --> 00:31:18.453
TALIESIN: Natural 20. About fucking time, you
little shit!

00:31:19.565 --> 00:31:27.303
MATT: She gives you a look. Looks over at Bo the
Breaker. Shakes her head. "Keep these two

00:31:27.303 --> 00:31:37.204
downstairs. This one let go. He seems to be free.
We'll be talking to you very soon." At which

00:31:37.204 --> 00:31:41.624
point, the crownsguard drag the chains back and
Gustav gives you a quick look under his eye and

00:31:41.624 --> 00:31:49.293
goes-- as they're pulled out of the room, out of
sight. She glances to you, "Well, you're out of

00:31:49.293 --> 00:31:56.303
chains! That's great. Doesn't mean you're absolved
of the investigation. So, where are you staying?

00:31:56.303 --> 00:31:59.817
You and your compatriots?"

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:03.725
LAURA: Well, technically we just all met,
technically.

00:32:03.725 --> 00:32:08.227
MATT: "Well, technically, as far as I'm concerned,
you're all together as part of this

00:32:08.227 --> 00:32:09.813
investigation."

00:32:09.813 --> 00:32:11.928
LAURA: We're a group you guys!

00:32:11.928 --> 00:32:15.291
(laughter)

00:32:16.981 --> 00:32:22.922
MATT: "So we're going to have our investigators
come to wherever you're staying, which--," and she

00:32:22.922 --> 00:32:27.478
looks down at some papers here, "-- looks to be
the Nestled Nook?"

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:29.070
TRAVIS: That's correct.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:34.137
MATT: "All right. Don't leave the city. We'll be
in touch."

00:32:34.137 --> 00:32:39.855
LAURA: Great, I really like it here so that's good
that we get to stay so long.

00:32:41.816 --> 00:32:44.072
MATT: "Do you have something to say?"

00:32:44.072 --> 00:32:50.554
TALIESIN: No. Just shocked to see someone die in
front of me not more than--

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:55.495
TRAVIS: I can assure you, we're here to cause no
trouble. We will be as compliant as we possibly

00:32:55.495 --> 00:32:57.523
can be.

00:32:58.222 --> 00:33:07.678
MATT: "Good. Dismissed!" She claps the edge of the
table. The remaining crownsguard, who's left there

00:33:07.678 --> 00:33:13.371
to keep watch, escorts you out off the stockade,
escorts you onto the street.

00:33:13.675 --> 00:33:18.189
LAURA: Her accent is really strong! It's hard to
not match her accent!

00:33:18.189 --> 00:33:21.357
(laughter)

00:33:21.357 --> 00:33:23.459
TALIESIN: It's the one accent that I really have
trouble with.

00:33:23.459 --> 00:33:25.457
TRAVIS: Would you call it infectious?

00:33:25.457 --> 00:33:27.252
TALIESIN: Bastard.

00:33:27.252 --> 00:33:28.336
MATT: Sorry.

00:33:28.336 --> 00:33:31.783
TALIESIN: The one that we know is a problem.

00:33:31.783 --> 00:33:39.094
LIAM: I'm going to call my cat back to me and I
drop the telepathy and I just start tugging you

00:33:39.401 --> 00:33:44.281
back to the Nestled Nook. Come on, we have to talk
about this. We have to decide what we're going to do.

00:33:44.281 --> 00:33:45.516
SAM: Right away.

00:33:45.516 --> 00:33:46.459
TRAVIS: Excuse me--

00:33:46.459 --> 00:33:47.545
LAURA: They're not with us.

00:33:47.545 --> 00:33:49.183
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought you were right behind us.

00:33:49.183 --> 00:33:50.613
LIAM: My cat was in there, but not I.

00:33:50.613 --> 00:33:53.271
MATT: Yeah, but you'd have to stay within 100 feet
to maintain that.

00:33:53.271 --> 00:33:58.162
LIAM: Well, we would've walked up to the building,
the cat would've scurried around, if possible. So

00:33:58.162 --> 00:34:01.852
I'd like to think that I heard all that, which is
why just I said all the things I did.

00:34:01.852 --> 00:34:05.594
MATT: You did hear all that. Okay, and I'd say, as
they're making their way out, you can probably

00:34:05.594 --> 00:34:11.519
duck around without them seeing you as they left.
Yeah, you can do that. So, you guys are jettisoned

00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:16.356
into the street. It's now probably just past
midnight.

00:34:16.356 --> 00:34:20.513
TRAVIS: Mollymauk, I don't mean to pry into your
business, but has this ever happened to you

00:34:20.513 --> 00:34:21.794
before?

00:34:21.794 --> 00:34:26.411
TALIESIN: This has never-- anything like this has
ever happened before. And thank you. For the

00:34:26.411 --> 00:34:29.834
record, I don't owe any of you anything--

00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:31.481
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know about that.

00:34:31.481 --> 00:34:36.217
TALIESIN: --I swear, but thank you, and I'm ready
to help with this.

00:34:36.217 --> 00:34:38.435
LAURA: Do you think it was the little girl?

00:34:38.435 --> 00:34:44.870
TALIESIN: No! That's an act, that's not anything.
It's just a show!

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:50.070
TRAVIS: Right, the large toad that was with the
girl, what's the story there?

00:34:51.427 --> 00:34:58.717
TALIESIN: It's nothing special, it's just a guy
making a buck, all right? He's fine!

00:34:58.717 --> 00:35:04.022
MATT: You hear the footfalls of guards approach
and the rattle of chains as you see Beauregard--

00:35:04.022 --> 00:35:08.065
TALIESIN: By the way, where's the obnoxious one?
The really loud--

00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:11.622
MATT: As opposed the rest of you who are gingerly
brought up, you see Beauregard being pulled

00:35:11.622 --> 00:35:15.626
forward but now the chains around her are being
pulled taught on two sides. She's being brought

00:35:15.626 --> 00:35:17.842
forward like a wild animal almost.

00:35:17.842 --> 00:35:20.122
MATT: And she's just being led towards the
stockade.

00:35:20.122 --> 00:35:21.332
MARISHA: Help.

00:35:21.332 --> 00:35:22.229
LAURA: What happened?

00:35:22.229 --> 00:35:24.565
MARISHA: Help. Help help help. Help help. Help
help help.

00:35:24.565 --> 00:35:26.223
(laughter)

00:35:26.223 --> 00:35:28.268
MARISHA: Help. I'm with you, I'm with you. Help
help.

00:35:28.268 --> 00:35:30.350
LAURA: Oh, I thought you didn't like jails.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:34.690
MARISHA: (clears throat) Help.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.278
TALIESIN: Is this part of the show by the way? I
was just curious.

00:35:37.278 --> 00:35:39.871
TRAVIS: Unfortunately, no.

00:35:40.415 --> 00:35:44.735
MATT: Which is the last thing you see as she is
yanked into the stockade and out of sight.

00:35:44.735 --> 00:35:47.259
TALIESIN: I'm going to be very helpful and not go
in there with the two of you while you try and get

00:35:47.259 --> 00:35:48.784
her out.

00:35:48.784 --> 00:35:50.800
LAURA: So should we go in and try to get her out?

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.592
TRAVIS: Well, yeah!

00:35:51.592 --> 00:35:53.186
LAURA: Okay.

00:35:53.186 --> 00:35:54.369
TALIESIN: I'll stand guard.

00:35:54.369 --> 00:35:56.371
LAURA: We'll follow her in.

00:35:56.371 --> 00:35:57.669
TRAVIS: Don't. Leave.

00:35:57.669 --> 00:35:59.624
TALIESIN: I have nowhere to go.

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:06.243
MATT: You walk in behind her. You watch her being
pulled to the stairs. She's bypassing the office

00:36:06.243 --> 00:36:12.607
of the Lawmaster right now and is being brought to
incarceration before being questioned. They bring

00:36:12.607 --> 00:36:17.928
her to the stairs and a torch-lit, subterranean
basement area. As you begin to approach and follow

00:36:17.928 --> 00:36:23.101
behind, you can see one of the guards who is
currently on watch. He sees you guys just exit and

00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:26.359
then walk back in, following another prisoner. And
stands up and goes, "I'm sorry, where are you

00:36:26.359 --> 00:36:27.856
going?"

00:36:27.856 --> 00:36:33.304
TRAVIS: It was a busy day for us. Unfortunately,
we're partially responsible for this one as well.

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:38.106
Bad luck.

00:36:38.108 --> 00:36:43.332
LAURA: She was also helping to save a lot of
people. Big misunderstanding.

00:36:44.485 --> 00:36:47.912
MATT: "Well, see her into her cell and please exit
the vicinity."

00:36:48.643 --> 00:36:50.883
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

00:36:50.883 --> 00:36:56.490
MATT: "Appreciate that." He follows behind you
guys. They're on high alert and they're a bit

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:01.518
scattered. You get the sense right now that they
have a lot of their initial stock of guards

00:37:01.518 --> 00:37:06.456
off-site right now. So they're doing the best they
can to hold on to what they currently have in the

00:37:06.456 --> 00:37:07.678
stockade.

00:37:07.678 --> 00:37:11.808
TRAVIS: To the side I say to Jester, I say: This
does not really fall in with keeping a low

00:37:11.808 --> 00:37:13.430
profile. We talked about this.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.926
LAURA: I know isn't it so weird?

00:37:17.866 --> 00:37:19.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is.

00:37:21.086 --> 00:37:27.549
MATT: You guys follow down to the basement portion
of this. Which there's a heavy locked door

00:37:27.549 --> 00:37:34.173
immediately that is opened from the opposite side.
You hear a couple of keys turn and the shifting of

00:37:34.194 --> 00:37:42.374
wood against metal before the door opens and
reveals the rest of a long hallway that is flanked

00:37:42.374 --> 00:37:49.216
by two rows of cells. Iron bars about maybe two
inches apart going across the entirety of this

00:37:49.216 --> 00:37:54.454
long hallway. You can't quite see the end of it
until you step down to where the door frame is.

00:37:54.454 --> 00:38:00.967
And there is probably a total of ten cells to each
side. As you walk through, you can see in the off

00:38:00.967 --> 00:38:06.439
shadows in the corners a few huddled bodies
hunched or asleep. Keeping to the shadows and out

00:38:06.439 --> 00:38:15.655
of the light. The smell of mildewed wet compost
and piss hits your nose like a wall.

00:38:15.655 --> 00:38:17.707
LAURA: It smells like Caleb down here.

00:38:17.707 --> 00:38:20.881
(laughter)

00:38:22.117 --> 00:38:28.367
MATT: You get about five cells in where you can
see the guard that was previously in there just

00:38:28.367 --> 00:38:34.594
finish off closing the cell that contains both
Gustav and Bo the Breaker. They move to the cell

00:38:34.594 --> 00:38:41.074
just beyond that, open that cell, and then go
ahead and put Beauregard into that one.

00:38:41.074 --> 00:38:43.165
TRAVIS: Are they not going to take her to see the
Lawmaker?

00:38:43.165 --> 00:38:46.484
LAURA: I know, why doesn't she get to talk to the
Lawmaster?

00:38:46.484 --> 00:38:53.101
MATT: As he closes and locks it, "Because she
decided not to come helpfully."

00:38:53.101 --> 00:38:55.619
LAURA: What do you mean?

00:38:55.619 --> 00:39:03.702
MARISHA: Ah, oh, no you misunderstood. See that
was just, I have this spasm that has this twitch.

00:39:03.702 --> 00:39:07.962
It was an injury from, like, a childhood thing.

00:39:07.962 --> 00:39:12.286
LAURA: Oh no, are you guys making fun of her
because of her spasm?

00:39:12.286 --> 00:39:17.156
MARISHA: Yeah that's actually-- (fake crying) it
was very sensitive for me. I had a really tough

00:39:17.156 --> 00:39:21.628
childhood. I was just trying to find a bathroom.

00:39:21.628 --> 00:39:26.616
MATT: The three guards walk away, not caring. Who
were there previously and--

00:39:26.616 --> 00:39:28.804
SAM: Spasm shaming.

00:39:28.804 --> 00:39:33.787
MATT: At this point, a man who is on the far end
of the hall walks up. And you can see him, he's a

00:39:33.787 --> 00:39:42.386
man with a heavy, bushy beard that obscures a lot
of a dark leather mantle, over a general cloth

00:39:42.386 --> 00:39:50.071
tunic. He has burly arms, heavy torso, super
scrawny legs, a widow's peak, and he looks to be

00:39:50.071 --> 00:39:56.950
the jailer. He walks up and puts his hand on the
bars and goes, "Oh well, if you want to be

00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:01.349
"patient, I'm sure the Lawmaster will be here
sometime in the morning and you can discuss

00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:05.045
"whatever this business is. But if you want to say
goodbye, now's the time."

00:40:05.045 --> 00:40:09.567
TRAVIS: Actually, we were just upstairs and it
would really help us if we could, perhaps,

00:40:09.567 --> 00:40:14.150
expedite the process. Perhaps there's an
arrangement we could come to if she could see the

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.694
Lawmaster now.

00:40:16.694 --> 00:40:25.687
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm looking injured, man. I show
him my eight hit points of damage.

00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:30.081
TALIESIN: How many kittens is that again?

00:40:30.081 --> 00:40:33.756
MATT: That's sixteen kittens. Kittens have half of
a hit point, I don't think kittens have more than

00:40:33.756 --> 00:40:34.760
that.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.786
LIAM: That's eight Frumpkins.

00:40:36.786 --> 00:40:39.178
TRAVIS: An audience is all we're asking for. No
favors.

00:40:39.178 --> 00:40:43.183
MARISHA: Yeah, this is just a wrong time, wrong
place thing.

00:40:43.183 --> 00:40:45.215
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:40:46.606 --> 00:40:49.051
SAM: Use it.

00:40:49.051 --> 00:40:51.289
TRAVIS: God bless. 16.

00:40:51.289 --> 00:40:55.285
MATT: He gives you a look and says, "All right,
but if she gets angry, it's not on me."

00:40:55.285 --> 00:40:57.305
TRAVIS: I understand. Thank you for your
understanding.

00:40:57.305 --> 00:41:01.306
LAURA: She's a very calm person. I've never seen
her angry, ever.

00:41:01.306 --> 00:41:06.657
MATT: He gives a whistle. Another crownsguard
comes up and approaches him and he goes, "I'm

00:41:06.657 --> 00:41:13.323
"sorry. Could you go and fetch the Lawmaster? They
are requesting an audience. If she gets angry,

00:41:13.323 --> 00:41:20.853
"just add it to this one's sentence." The guard
exits and a brief time by, you can hear the slight

00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:27.209
muddled cursing of a dwarven female descending the
stairs. You can see she has an overcoat on, was

00:41:27.209 --> 00:41:30.661
halfway out of the stockades finishing up her
evening in her office.

00:41:30.661 --> 00:41:33.263
TRAVIS: Beau, remember your little sister.

00:41:33.263 --> 00:41:35.205
SAM: Oh, what? Little sister? What?

00:41:35.205 --> 00:41:37.961
LIAM: We're not there.

00:41:39.277 --> 00:41:45.467
MATT: So, as the Lawmaster approaches, now pulling
the coat over herself, she goes, "Okay, so you've

00:41:45.467 --> 00:41:52.477
"returned, apparently, needing to poke into what
business now before I go off and get some food?"

00:41:52.477 --> 00:41:56.016
TRAVIS: I do hate to trouble you again, twice in
the same evening. It's incredibly inconvenient.

00:41:56.016 --> 00:41:58.712
MATT: "I hate being troubled twice in the same
evening."

00:41:58.712 --> 00:42:03.339
TRAVIS: If we may, this sweet girl here was also
part of our party and she is quite the protective

00:42:03.339 --> 00:42:12.156
one. I'm afraid that she was also providing aid to
our fellows in that tent. I'm afraid her younger

00:42:12.156 --> 00:42:19.162
sister was attacked in a similar way. I feel it's
only prudent to acknowledge that she was trying to

00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:24.942
protect this young dwarven girl that performed in
the circus. She means no harm.

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:28.149
LAURA: It was an adopted sister.

00:42:28.149 --> 00:42:32.295
MARISHA: I practically raised her. It's a
sensitive subject.

00:42:32.295 --> 00:42:34.734
MATT: Okay. I would like a deception check.

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:45.769
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah baby. 24. Natural 18.

00:42:45.769 --> 00:42:49.671
MATT: Modified by their answers.

00:42:51.247 --> 00:42:53.047
LAURA: I was helping!

00:42:53.047 --> 00:42:55.959
TRAVIS: I'm new at this stat! Don't fuck it up!

00:42:58.168 --> 00:43:02.856
MATT: She gives a narrow look through her eyes,
looks to one of the other guards that you can see

00:43:02.856 --> 00:43:10.555
standing in the back, a familiar one to you, Beau,
and goes, "Is this true?" He goes, "It appeared to

00:43:10.555 --> 00:43:20.018
"us that she was attempting to escape upon us
trying to bring calm to a very tense situation,

00:43:20.468 --> 00:43:29.615
"but I'll leave it in your realm, Lawmaster." She
looks back. "So your sister, apparently, is part

00:43:29.615 --> 00:43:32.492
"of this scenario as well?"

00:43:32.492 --> 00:43:36.106
MARISHA: Adopted sister.

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:40.145
MATT: "Okay. Well, your sister's under
investigation."

00:43:40.145 --> 00:43:43.301
MARISHA: Sure.

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:47.327
LAURA: She's staying at the same place that we
are.

00:43:47.327 --> 00:43:51.298
TRAVIS: Indeed. And we can be found at any hour.
The Nestled Nook Inn is where we are.

00:43:51.298 --> 00:43:56.275
MARISHA: And I'm more than willing to be compliant
with the investigation. In fact, you can see the

00:43:56.275 --> 00:44:03.621
injury the beast left on my ribs, so if you want
to test it for any type of specimen samples, feel

00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:09.282
free. It's very painful, but I'm willing to do it
for the cause.

00:44:09.282 --> 00:44:10.937
LAURA: Do you need me to heal that?

00:44:10.937 --> 00:44:14.524
MARISHA (through gritted teeth): No! For the
cause! Do it for the cause!

00:44:14.524 --> 00:44:18.931
MATT: At which she looks to you now and goes, "Are
you saying you might have been infected by this

00:44:18.931 --> 00:44:20.477
"beast?"

00:44:21.486 --> 00:44:29.671
MARISHA: No. It's a separate issue. There was two
things going on. There was, like, the big angry

00:44:29.671 --> 00:44:35.097
toad beast and he got a swipe at me. And then
there were people who were getting attacked.

00:44:35.097 --> 00:44:39.201
MATT: "Theeds!" And she looks over to the jailer,
who goes, "Aye?" And she goes, "Could you have a

00:44:39.201 --> 00:44:41.865
"look at this wound for me real fast? I want to
make sure this isn't something that's going to

00:44:41.865 --> 00:44:42.966
"spread."

00:44:42.966 --> 00:44:44.682
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:46.993
TRAVIS: A great idea indeed. And thankfully there
was no flesh-to-flesh contact.

00:44:46.993 --> 00:44:48.394
MARISHA: Nope.

00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:54.460
LAURA: Yeah. The big zombie beast especially was
using a lot of, like, sticks and stuff to attack

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.698
people more than any kind of mouth.

00:44:57.698 --> 00:45:02.216
(laughter)

00:45:02.216 --> 00:45:09.710
MATT: The jailer, Theeds, takes a quick look at
the wound and he goes, "No, it appears to mainly

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:19.016
"be just bludgeoning. I mean, we'll keep a close
eye on her." You can see now the Lawmaster is

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:22.655
rubbing her eyes in frustration and goes, "I just
want to sleep."

00:45:23.603 --> 00:45:27.627
TRAVIS: Indeed. It would give us no greater
pleasure than to get out of your hair.

00:45:28.176 --> 00:45:37.769
MATT: "Fine. We'll have guards posted at the
outside of the inn. You're not to leave until this

00:45:37.769 --> 00:45:45.345
"investigation is complete. It may take days. Until
we find out who's responsible for these deaths and

00:45:45.345 --> 00:45:50.710
"bring them to justice, you are not to leave the
tavern."

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:51.763
TRAVIS: Understood.

00:45:51.763 --> 00:45:57.357
LAURA: Like, at all during the day, even? Just a
question. If we wanted to shop or something. Not

00:45:57.357 --> 00:45:59.090
okay?

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.734
MATT: "Not until this is done."

00:46:00.734 --> 00:46:01.918
LAURA: Cool.

00:46:01.918 --> 00:46:05.444
MATT: "Because otherwise, you're welcome to stay
here, instead."

00:46:05.444 --> 00:46:10.395
LAURA: It is really beautiful here, but I think
I'd rather stay at the inn?

00:46:10.395 --> 00:46:15.700
TRAVIS: Indeed we would. This is most gracious of
you, Lawmaster Norda.

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:20.103
MATT: "Get them the fuck out." She turns around
and sighs heavily as she stomps out of the

00:46:20.103 --> 00:46:30.478
chamber. The jailer opens the cell door and allows
Beauregard back out, and he looks a bit confused

00:46:30.478 --> 00:46:37.987
but amused at the same time. The guards that had
originally arrested you escort you out, not

00:46:37.987 --> 00:46:46.972
leaving any element of their sight off of you.
They escort you guys to the actual inn itself, to

00:46:46.972 --> 00:46:53.755
the bottom floor of the Nestled Nook Inn, watch
you enter, and then post up right outside the main

00:46:53.755 --> 00:46:55.411
entrance to the tavern.

00:46:56.342 --> 00:46:59.363
LAURA: You should have spasmed a couple times on
the way here.

00:46:59.363 --> 00:47:00.830
MARISHA: Aw, shit.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.930
LAURA: Yeah. Opportunity missed.

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:05.508
MARISHA: My little sister? What the what?

00:47:05.508 --> 00:47:07.760
LAURA: She's a dwarf! She's human!

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:13.118
TRAVIS: What? No, I was trying to say she had a
little sister that had a similar incident and that

00:47:13.118 --> 00:47:16.646
made you try to protect Toya. I was trying to
throw you a bone.

00:47:16.646 --> 00:47:19.043
LAURA: Oh. You didn't make that clear at all.

00:47:19.043 --> 00:47:21.243
MATT: Are you guys up in your room, or are you in
the tavern?

00:47:21.243 --> 00:47:22.544
LIAM: Yeah. We're having a talk.

00:47:22.544 --> 00:47:24.915
TRAVIS: We're under watch.

00:47:24.915 --> 00:47:26.594
MARISHA: I was just trying to go with what you
said.

00:47:26.594 --> 00:47:28.686
TRAVIS: Yeah. You did all right.

00:47:28.686 --> 00:47:34.219
MARISHA: All right. I mean, it kind of worked. But
you're not entirely wrong! I was trying to go get

00:47:34.219 --> 00:47:38.137
the stupid little girl, who seemed to be stupid.

00:47:38.137 --> 00:47:39.882
TRAVIS: Did you see anything?

00:47:39.882 --> 00:47:43.183
MARISHA: I tried to save her. I was like, get the
hint, what's going on?

00:47:43.183 --> 00:47:46.107
LAURA: Why would you save her? She turned those
people into zombies.

00:47:46.107 --> 00:47:47.725
MARISHA: (stammers)

00:47:47.725 --> 00:47:49.021
TRAVIS: We don't know that.

00:47:49.021 --> 00:47:50.440
LAURA: I mean, she could have.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.833
TALIESIN: She didn't.

00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:54.237
LAURA: Oh, hi! You're here.

00:47:54.237 --> 00:48:00.358
MARISHA: Yeah, if anything, we should be looking
at this guy. Why are we putting our neck out for

00:48:00.358 --> 00:48:02.472
you?

00:48:02.472 --> 00:48:06.303
TALIESIN: You're putting your neck out for Toya
for some strange reason and I don't know why,

00:48:06.303 --> 00:48:08.179
she's perfectly capable of handling herself.

00:48:08.179 --> 00:48:09.858
TRAVIS: Have you been to this town before?

00:48:09.858 --> 00:48:14.039
TALIESIN: Not that I can remember. They all look
the same after a while.

00:48:14.039 --> 00:48:18.344
MATT: You've come through once, but that was a
while back and you weren't really paying

00:48:18.344 --> 00:48:19.449
attention.

00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:20.648
TALIESIN: Busy, yeah.

00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:23.281
TRAVIS: And you've never seen conditions like this
affect any other carnival goer before?

00:48:23.281 --> 00:48:28.491
TALIESIN: Nothing like this. Hundreds, possibly
thousands of shows. Yeah, thousands of shows.

00:48:28.491 --> 00:48:32.708
Nothing. Never. It's not us.

00:48:32.708 --> 00:48:36.014
LAURA: So great! We're stuck in a city that has
zombie issues, that's all.

00:48:36.014 --> 00:48:38.398
TRAVIS: Where are the other two?

00:48:38.398 --> 00:48:40.451
TALIESIN: Which other two?

00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:44.336
TRAVIS: The stinky one and the little one.

00:48:44.336 --> 00:48:46.066
TALIESIN: Oh, your friends!

00:48:46.066 --> 00:48:49.939
TRAVIS: Yeah. Can we look around and see if we
spot Caleb and--

00:48:49.939 --> 00:48:52.997
TALIESIN: You call them Stinky and the little one?
All right.

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:57.144
MATT: You spot around the interior of the tavern.
They don't appear to be nearby.

00:48:57.144 --> 00:48:58.563
TRAVIS: I wonder if they came back.

00:48:58.563 --> 00:49:01.244
LAURA: I'll go up and ask the tavern keeper.

00:49:01.244 --> 00:49:02.164
MATT: Okay. Yorda?

00:49:02.164 --> 00:49:03.634
LAURA: Yeah, Yorda.

00:49:03.634 --> 00:49:09.632
MATT: "Oh, hi! Everything all right? You had a few
bruiser types leading you in here, some of the

00:49:09.632 --> 00:49:10.647
"crownsguard, huh?"

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:13.185
LAURA: Oh my gosh, there was this big trouble at
the carnival, did you go?

00:49:13.185 --> 00:49:15.628
MATT: "I heard about that. I didn't go in there,
but people are coming in here saying--"

00:49:15.628 --> 00:49:16.973
LAURA: Somebody turned into a zombie and then--

00:49:16.973 --> 00:49:18.077
MATT: "I heard that! That's incredible!"

00:49:18.077 --> 00:49:23.126
LAURA: Yeah! And then we're all under
investigation because we saved them! These guards

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:32.909
are weird. Hey, did you see the wizard guy, the
stinky guy and the little halfling?

00:49:32.909 --> 00:49:35.642
MATT: "Yeah, they came in not but a few minutes
before you did. They went upstairs."

00:49:35.642 --> 00:49:36.772
LAURA: Oh, great! They're here!

00:49:36.772 --> 00:49:37.884
TRAVIS: They are?

00:49:37.884 --> 00:49:38.706
LAURA: Yeah.

00:49:38.706 --> 00:49:40.907
TRAVIS: Good.

00:49:40.907 --> 00:49:44.067
MATT: Meanwhile, the two of you are upstairs in
your own chambers.

00:49:44.067 --> 00:49:48.804
LIAM: During all of that, I would have dragged you
back here, brought you upstairs. And I whip off my

00:49:48.804 --> 00:49:54.678
ratty coat, throw it on the bed and sit down on
the ground so that I'm eye level with you, Nott.

00:49:54.678 --> 00:49:55.919
SAM: Hi.

00:49:55.919 --> 00:50:00.895
LIAM: Nott, you and I have to make some decisions
right now, okay?

00:50:00.895 --> 00:50:01.767
SAM: Now?

00:50:01.767 --> 00:50:02.941
LIAM: Yes.

00:50:02.941 --> 00:50:04.439
SAM: Why?

00:50:04.439 --> 00:50:08.355
LIAM: Well, I know why we said we were coming
here.

00:50:08.355 --> 00:50:15.695
SAM: Get some booze, got some books, find a little
taste of civilization, maybe some better food.

00:50:15.695 --> 00:50:26.136
LIAM: Yeah. I didn't say, I also had the idea--
you know, you and I meeting and teaming up has

00:50:26.136 --> 00:50:28.009
been a good thing.

00:50:28.009 --> 00:50:32.515
SAM: Oh, yes, very good. I know everyone else
makes fun of your smell, but I don't smell

00:50:32.515 --> 00:50:34.895
nothing.

00:50:36.704 --> 00:50:45.610
LIAM: That's what I like about you. I have been
thinking, and yesterday just furthers that

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:52.722
thinking, that I don't think you and I are enough.
I had the idea that we would come here maybe and

00:50:52.722 --> 00:51:00.123
find others that we could tag along with, or meet
up the way you and I did. But now I think that is

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:07.646
a terrible idea! The people we spent the day with
are lunatics. I don't think that we can do this.

00:51:07.646 --> 00:51:14.193
I've changed my mind entirely, and I think we
should go, but we can't now because we are stuck

00:51:14.193 --> 00:51:15.449
here for the moment.

00:51:15.449 --> 00:51:18.916
SAM: Under sort of holding arrest or something? We
can't leave the city.

00:51:18.916 --> 00:51:20.180
LIAM: No.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:29.408
SAM: But I was thinking about this. The people we
met down there and spent the day with: they are

00:51:29.408 --> 00:51:37.926
lunatics, but they draw a lot of attention to
themselves, leaving us free to sort of slink back

00:51:37.926 --> 00:51:44.503
into the shadows a little bit. It might be sort of
the perfect camouflage. No one's going to be

00:51:44.503 --> 00:51:49.532
looking for a little goblin girl anymore, because
they'll be looking at the crazy people, the

00:51:49.532 --> 00:51:54.287
tieflings running around smashing shit.

00:51:54.287 --> 00:51:59.774
LIAM: You know, I had not thought of it quite in
that way and that is a good point, but I am not

00:51:59.774 --> 00:52:09.146
convinced. I'm not convinced. And perhaps we're
better off-- maybe I was too ambitious.

00:52:09.146 --> 00:52:18.475
SAM: Well, let's give it a day and if things seem
a little bit, you know, skinky-doodie tomorrow, we

00:52:18.475 --> 00:52:25.248
can fritter away in the middle of the day or
something.

00:52:26.431 --> 00:52:37.340
LIAM: All right. Well, we'll wait and see. While
we're here, one thing, okay? No Money Pot. No Rat

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:41.864
Food. None of those plays. I have silver, we don't
need it right now.

00:52:41.864 --> 00:52:45.938
SAM: But we need to replenish the healing potion
you used. If we don't have that, then what happens

00:52:45.938 --> 00:52:48.616
the next you get in trouble?

00:52:48.616 --> 00:52:56.412
LIAM: We're sealed here, and they are watching.
We're with a couple of tieflings, a little person

00:52:56.468 --> 00:53:02.733
in a doll mask, and a dirty ginger. We've got
people staring at us every second of the day. We

00:53:02.733 --> 00:53:06.442
need to dial it back a little bit.

00:53:06.442 --> 00:53:14.530
SAM: All right, but how on earth are we-- all
right. We can cool it with the cons for a couple

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:21.872
of days. But I can't promise that I won't get the
itch again.

00:53:21.872 --> 00:53:27.316
LIAM: You just talk to me. You hold Frumpkin. Just
keep your hands full with Frumpkin, okay? Hold my

00:53:27.316 --> 00:53:28.573
cat, okay?

00:53:28.573 --> 00:53:30.703
SAM: All right.

00:53:30.703 --> 00:53:34.508
LIAM: And then this is going to blow over because
we didn't do anything! We did something good.

00:53:34.508 --> 00:53:36.492
SAM: No! I didn't do nothing, we just went to a
show.

00:53:36.492 --> 00:53:37.636
LIAM: That's right.

00:53:37.636 --> 00:53:42.831
SAM: It was a pretty good show. Up until, you
know, the dead people part.

00:53:42.831 --> 00:53:44.569
LIAM: But it was a good show, wasn't it?

00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:51.565
SAM: Yeah! Well, we'll lay low. Should we pretend
that we're still friends with these people?

00:53:51.565 --> 00:53:55.307
LIAM: I was going to suggest the same thing. In
fact, I think we should go downstairs. They're

00:53:55.307 --> 00:54:01.863
going to be coming back. We don't want to cause a
stir with them, either. We just want to leave if

00:54:01.863 --> 00:54:03.766
that's what we're going to do.

00:54:03.766 --> 00:54:07.359
SAM: Don't worry! I'll turn on the charm.

00:54:08.376 --> 00:54:09.460
TALIESIN: Thank God.

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:15.425
LIAM: Okay. Let's get a drink.

00:54:15.425 --> 00:54:18.110
SAM: Thank gods.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:19.900
LIAM: We head downstairs.

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:24.872
MATT: You guys head down. You get to the bottom of
the stairs just in time to see Jester, Beauregard,

00:54:24.872 --> 00:54:29.396
Molly, and Fjord looking across the tavern, making
their way in your direction, and you guys notice

00:54:29.396 --> 00:54:32.190
them meeting you in the tavern room, as well.

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:43.358
SAM: Oh, thank God you're here and safe! We missed
you! Somehow we got separated! Friends.

00:54:43.358 --> 00:54:44.824
LAURA: That happens, yes.

00:54:44.824 --> 00:54:46.086
MARISHA: Can I insight check him?

00:54:46.086 --> 00:54:47.973
MATT: Sure.

00:54:47.973 --> 00:54:50.942
SAM and MATT: Her.

00:54:50.942 --> 00:54:53.286
MARISHA: Her. Sam. Natural 20.

00:54:54.806 --> 00:54:56.005
SAM: I'm lying!

00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:59.354
(laughter)

00:55:01.181 --> 00:55:06.536
MARISHA: Front butt?! You just saw that, too?!

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:10.971
(laughter)

00:55:11.989 --> 00:55:15.616
MARISHA: You guys peaced out pretty quickly.

00:55:17.166 --> 00:55:21.157
LIAM: We did, I did not come to Trostenwald to go
to jail.

00:55:22.793 --> 00:55:26.281
TRAVIS: What did you come to Trostenwald for?

00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:35.585
LIAM: We are tired. We've been traveling a long
time. We've been saving. Wanted to take it easy

00:55:35.585 --> 00:55:36.996
for a few days.

00:55:36.996 --> 00:55:41.126
TRAVIS: Sure, I'm not trying to pry. I was just
curious where you were going.

00:55:41.143 --> 00:55:42.821
MARISHA: Just curious why you have a mask.

00:55:42.821 --> 00:55:46.006
TALIESIN: If I'm going to listening to somebody's
life story I'm going to need a drink. You,

00:55:46.006 --> 00:55:47.624
gorgeous, what's your name?

00:55:47.875 --> 00:55:55.033
MATT: You look over and see a woman with darker
hair, the general barmaid. "Adelaine."

00:55:55.033 --> 00:56:00.151
TALIESIN: Adelaine, I would like a round for all
these terrible people and one for myself. What's

00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:04.238
the difference between these three beers? I've
honestly got to admit, they all taste the same to

00:56:04.238 --> 00:56:06.723
me.

00:56:06.723 --> 00:56:09.311
MATT: "Go with the von Brandt."

00:56:09.311 --> 00:56:13.301
TALIESIN: Let's get a round of von Brandt for
everybody.

00:56:13.301 --> 00:56:18.299
TARVIS: Actually, if it's all the same I'm not
really an ale fan. Do you have any fire whiskey?

00:56:18.299 --> 00:56:21.216
MATT: "We can get you some liquor, aye."

00:56:21.216 --> 00:56:22.250
LAURA: Can I have some milk?

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:24.413
SAM: Two, please.

00:56:24.413 --> 00:56:29.172
MATT: "All right." She walks away.

00:56:29.172 --> 00:56:32.547
LAURA: You think she heard that I wanted milk?

00:56:32.547 --> 00:56:35.898
TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm going to ask for one
of each of these beers because I want to have a

00:56:35.898 --> 00:56:39.535
tasting competition. I'm not going to be drinking
alone.

00:56:39.535 --> 00:56:43.267
LIAM: I wander away from these two with their
questions and I sit down with Molly.

00:56:43.267 --> 00:56:45.603
LAURA: Caleb, you want to see something cool?

00:56:45.603 --> 00:56:47.438
LIAM: I would love to see something cool.

00:56:47.438 --> 00:56:51.638
LAURA: I show Caleb where I etched the dick in the
table a couple nights ago.

00:56:51.638 --> 00:56:55.281
MARISHA: Yeah! Bringing it back.

00:56:55.281 --> 00:56:56.577
LIAM: That's pretty good.

00:56:56.577 --> 00:56:58.401
TALIESIN: How'd you etch a deck in the table?

00:56:58.401 --> 00:56:59.639
LAURA: It's a dick.

00:56:59.639 --> 00:57:00.842
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:57:01.125 --> 00:57:03.658
LIAM: Have you always been an artist?

00:57:03.658 --> 00:57:05.943
LAURA: I have actually, I've been an artist since
I was little.

00:57:06.563 --> 00:57:08.643
TALIESIN: You think that's what they look like?

00:57:08.643 --> 00:57:13.047
LAURA: I've seen a lot of dicks. That is what most
of them look like.

00:57:13.437 --> 00:57:15.338
TALIESIN: I'm already in my cups.

00:57:16.618 --> 00:57:17.736
LAURA: What?

00:57:20.059 --> 00:57:23.878
LIAM: So where do you two come from?

00:57:23.878 --> 00:57:25.380
LAURA: Us two?

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.238
LIAM: Yes, you two with the horns.

00:57:27.238 --> 00:57:30.794
LAURA: Well, I don't know where he comes from. You
think we all come from the same place? That was

00:57:30.794 --> 00:57:34.861
really inconsiderate.

00:57:34.861 --> 00:57:36.565
LIAM: No, you are very different it's very clear.

00:57:36.565 --> 00:57:37.817
LAURA: He's purple.

00:57:37.817 --> 00:57:39.319
TALIESIN: She's blue.

00:57:39.771 --> 00:57:41.525
LAURA: Which is pretty rare.

00:57:41.525 --> 00:57:43.164
LIAM: He's every color.

00:57:43.164 --> 00:57:45.877
TALIESIN: It's very true.

00:57:49.223 --> 00:57:55.584
LAURA: I'm from Nicodranas.

00:57:55.584 --> 00:58:01.220
LIAM: Remember when we started the first campaign
and all those places came in a split second and

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:10.823
all that history. I'm from Shrev`nam Chicago. Oh
yes.

00:58:15.373 --> 00:58:17.770
TALIESIN: I'm from the circus.

00:58:18.972 --> 00:58:20.973
LIAM: So you're a traveler then?

00:58:20.973 --> 00:58:23.393
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Quite a while.

00:58:23.393 --> 00:58:26.330
LIAM: Since childhood?

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:34.629
TALIESIN: Long as I can reasonably remember at the
very least. It's been a while. It's nice. I like

00:58:34.629 --> 00:58:37.421
it. They're good people. Work hard.

00:58:37.421 --> 00:58:40.348
LIAM: You have a lot of scars.

00:58:40.348 --> 00:58:43.464
TALIESIN: That's a very funny story, actually.

00:58:43.464 --> 00:58:45.160
TRAVIS: I like funny stories.

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.922
TALIESIN: Me too.

00:58:49.704 --> 00:58:53.202
TRAVIS: You did some crazy shit with that sword of
yours.

00:58:53.202 --> 00:59:03.049
TALIESIN: Thank you. These swords-- you buy a
drink and we'll see.

00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:06.747
TRAVIS: You polish off that one already?

00:59:10.007 --> 00:59:12.130
LAURA: Wow, that's a lot-- okay.

00:59:14.888 --> 00:59:17.730
TRAVIS: Can we get another round? For the--

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:20.125
TALIESIN: How much I owe you for the first round?

00:59:20.125 --> 00:59:22.248
MATT: They are keeping a tally of the table.

00:59:22.248 --> 00:59:24.579
LIAM: Frumpkin scrabbles up onto Nott's shoulder.

00:59:26.889 --> 00:59:30.361
SAM: Hi Frumpy, nice to see you again.

00:59:30.791 --> 00:59:34.095
TALIESIN: Mother always told me to never give a
story away for free.

00:59:34.095 --> 00:59:35.393
TRAVIS: Wise words.

00:59:35.393 --> 00:59:38.042
LAURA: My mother said don't give away other things
for free.

00:59:38.042 --> 00:59:40.242
TALIESIN: I already like your mother.

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:43.354
MARISHA: My mother always said nothing in life is
free.

00:59:43.354 --> 00:59:45.667
TALIESIN: I can tell.

00:59:45.667 --> 00:59:54.662
MARISHA: None of this absolves the dodgy goblin
who slinked past that first question. Where are

00:59:54.662 --> 00:59:57.751
you from? What are you traveling from? Why the
mask?

00:59:57.751 --> 01:00:01.664
TRAVIS: Only because we seem to find ourselves in
quite the predicament.

01:00:01.664 --> 01:00:07.824
SAM: We're just a couple of friends, strolling
around the countryside looking for adventure.

01:00:07.824 --> 01:00:10.032
MARISHA: Sure you are.

01:00:10.032 --> 01:00:14.555
LIAM: Do you see many goblins walking around
cities here?

01:00:15.133 --> 01:00:21.093
MARISHA: It has nothing to do with that. People
who move from place to place frequently tend to

01:00:21.093 --> 01:00:23.977
have other stories as to why they're doing it.

01:00:23.977 --> 01:00:28.460
LIAM: Well, let me make it clear: goblins are not
typically welcome in any cities, that is why the

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.670
mask.

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:35.640
MARISHA: Well, you're going back to the goblin
thing. I'm more curious about the travel thing.

01:00:36.234 --> 01:00:45.510
SAM: We have a string of bad luck. We tend to get
in trouble in places for various reasons. Some of

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:50.271
which is my fault. Most of which is my fault. I
have sticky fingers. I can't help myself

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:58.973
sometimes. I'm fascinated by little bobbles and
fancy pieces of jewelries and I love trinkets so

01:00:58.973 --> 01:01:07.977
much! I just have to take them, and have them
with me, and put them in my pockets. It's gotten

01:01:08.134 --> 01:01:18.332
us in a few scrapes a couple times. Caleb, he is
fantastic. Very patient with me, understands. But

01:01:18.332 --> 01:01:27.483
really it's my fault; it's not him. He's a smart
man, a brilliant magician! Have you seen? Some of

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.981
his tricks are phenomenal, really.

01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:31.491
TRAVIS: No, I'd love to.

01:01:31.491 --> 01:01:36.983
SAM: I feel bad to because we never stay in one
place long enough for him to have a decent shower.

01:01:37.176 --> 01:01:41.730
(laughter)

01:01:42.147 --> 01:01:44.909
TRAVIS: It's a moving story.

01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:51.086
MARISHA: I immediately check my pockets after that
to see is Nott has lifted anything. Is everything

01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:52.703
still there, all my coin?

01:01:52.703 --> 01:01:54.019
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:01:54.019 --> 01:01:55.896
TALIESIN: I'm going to join you on this one.

01:01:57.256 --> 01:02:01.780
MARISHA: Not great. Not great at all. Six.

01:02:02.378 --> 01:02:04.029
TALIESIN: 16.

01:02:04.029 --> 01:02:07.698
MATT: 16? Everything seems to be in order for
you.

01:02:07.698 --> 01:02:12.860
MARISHA: Wait that was a 15! Right? That was the
dice I rolled? 16.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.335
MATT: Everything seems to be in order.

01:02:15.335 --> 01:02:17.869
MARISHA: Okay.

01:02:18.461 --> 01:02:22.455
SAM: Anyway, that's the long and short of it.

01:02:22.455 --> 01:02:25.336
LAURA: What do you do with the things once you
steal them?

01:02:25.336 --> 01:02:28.338
SAM: Well the nice ones I keep. I have a little--

01:02:28.338 --> 01:02:30.067
LAURA: Do you have a collection?

01:02:30.067 --> 01:02:38.918
SAM: I collect a lot of things, but in the last
place we hunkered down, it was all taken from me.

01:02:38.918 --> 01:02:46.587
We were in one of those prisons before-- Am I
sharing too much? I'm sharing too much, aren't I?

01:02:46.587 --> 01:02:52.466
We were in a prison, they took all of our
belongings. I lost all of my collections. I had a

01:02:52.466 --> 01:03:00.177
lovely rock collection. I had a rare coin
collection. I had a stick collection. Yeah, it's

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:02.010
all gone now.

01:03:02.206 --> 01:03:04.380
LAURA: What about shiny things, though?

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.789
SAM: I love them. I just don't have any right
now.

01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:10.538
LAURA: Because I think if you have sticky fingers
for sticks and rocks, I don't think that will get

01:03:10.538 --> 01:03:12.353
you in trouble.

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:17.150
SAM: True. But they were like people's canes and
things.

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:26.724
(laughter)

01:03:26.724 --> 01:03:32.475
SAM: I mean I call them sticks because I don't
need them. But I suppose they really needed them.

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.270
LAURA: Yeah, that makes sense.

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:37.664
TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.

01:03:38.117 --> 01:03:45.769
MARISHA: Wait, I'm sorry. I think I need
clarification. If sticks mean things like valuable

01:03:45.769 --> 01:03:49.414
canes, what do rocks mean to you?

01:03:49.414 --> 01:03:55.804
SAM: You know those rocks that humans wear on
their fingers and around their necks and stuff.

01:03:55.804 --> 01:03:58.509
They're really nice rocks.

01:03:58.509 --> 01:04:01.441
LIAM: We don't have many of those at the moment.

01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:05.735
TRAVIS: Would it be fair to say that the more
someone desires something, the more you're

01:04:05.735 --> 01:04:08.844
interest increases?

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:21.002
SAM: Oh I don't care about the people who have
them. I just like pretty things. Toys, anything

01:04:21.002 --> 01:04:22.343
really.

01:04:22.343 --> 01:04:25.112
LAURA: I'll keep an eye out for things that you
would like.

01:04:25.112 --> 01:04:27.728
SAM: Okay! Can you help with that?

01:04:27.728 --> 01:04:32.053
LAURA: I can if you want me to. Or I can point it
out.

01:04:32.053 --> 01:04:37.084
MARISHA: Is it the joy of taking the things or do
you just like gifts?

01:04:37.084 --> 01:04:39.998
SAM: No, it's the collecting.

01:04:39.998 --> 01:04:45.774
LIAM: It's like a nervous tick a little bit.

01:04:45.774 --> 01:04:49.390
TRAVIS: Are you good at it? Do you get caught very
often?

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:52.561
SAM: Well, would you like a demonstration?

01:04:52.561 --> 01:04:54.623
LAURA: Yes!

01:04:54.623 --> 01:04:59.070
TRAVIS: Now, Jester, if I may, we are already in a
little bit of a pickle.

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:03.540
LAURA: Steal something from me! Do you want me to
close my eyes?

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:12.752
SAM: Sure! That'll make it really easy. Are they
closed?

01:05:12.752 --> 01:05:14.890
LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:16.389 --> 01:05:27.876
SAM: All right. Out of practice here. I'm going to
do a shot. Crack my knuckles.

01:05:28.235 --> 01:05:32.045
LAURA: Just don't take the thing on my waist,
because he'll be pissed.

01:05:32.045 --> 01:05:35.243
SAM: He'll be pissed? What?

01:05:35.243 --> 01:05:36.697
LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:36.697 --> 01:05:37.763
SAM: He?

01:05:37.763 --> 01:05:38.713
LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:38.713 --> 01:05:40.015
SAM: What's on your waist?

01:05:40.015 --> 01:05:41.980
TALIESIN: I'm looking at her waist. What's on her
waist?

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.468
MATT: What's on your waist?

01:05:43.468 --> 01:05:45.562
LAURA: My symbol to the Traveler.

01:05:45.562 --> 01:05:51.847
SAM: Oh. All right, I'll go to her left buttcheek
pocket and fish around.

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:58.864
LAURA: I'm in a dress. I don't have a pocket on my
buttcheek. But you can try.

01:05:58.864 --> 01:06:03.162
SAM: What pockets do you have?

01:06:03.162 --> 01:06:09.458
LAURA: I would have pockets on the front of my
dress, and maybe a little pouch on my hip.

01:06:09.458 --> 01:06:11.225
SAM: I'll do the hip pocket.

01:06:11.225 --> 01:06:13.664
MATT: All right, make a sleight of hand check.

01:06:14.183 --> 01:06:15.639
SAM: Three.

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:18.977
(laughter)

01:06:18.977 --> 01:06:21.904
MATT: You close your eyes and feel a tug and a
shake--

01:06:21.904 --> 01:06:24.744
SAM: Plus eight.

01:06:24.744 --> 01:06:27.070
MATT: What's your passive perception?

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:29.122
TALIESIN: I'm going to guess ten.

01:06:29.122 --> 01:06:30.743
LAURA: No, it's 13.

01:06:30.743 --> 01:06:32.975
MATT: So, yeah, you totally feel--

01:06:32.975 --> 01:06:35.324
LAURA: You're doing great!

01:06:37.383 --> 01:06:46.962
SAM: This is not how it usually works! The person
is not really expecting it. This is embarrassing,

01:06:46.962 --> 01:06:51.222
really. I have the one skill and I failed at it.

01:06:51.222 --> 01:06:54.535
LAURA: It's okay, you can keep practicing.

01:06:54.535 --> 01:06:58.091
LIAM: There is that one magic trick that you're
able to do. Would you like to show them the magic

01:06:58.091 --> 01:07:06.439
trick that you can do? I pull out a small red clay
ceramic bowl. Then I pull out a copper piece.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:09.837
Here, you know the trick, right?

01:07:10.198 --> 01:07:14.256
SAM: Yes, I know the trick. Takes a little bit of
time, doesn't it?

01:07:14.256 --> 01:07:15.738
LIAM: You're good.

01:07:15.738 --> 01:07:22.983
SAM: Okay. (clears throat) I do know one piece of
magic. Feast your eyes--

01:07:22.983 --> 01:07:25.761
TRAVIS: I take one step back.

01:07:25.989 --> 01:07:36.294
on the sacred money pot of school. 
If you place a copper piece into this pot

01:07:36.294 --> 01:07:39.645
and say the magic words-- 
what's the magic word again?

01:07:39.645 --> 01:07:41.168
LIAM: Fibulous.

01:07:41.168 --> 01:07:45.448
SAM: Fibulous! It will turn into a silver piece.

01:07:45.448 --> 01:07:48.495
LAURA: Should I say it?

01:07:48.495 --> 01:07:50.178
TALIESIN: I want to hear you say it, anyway.

01:07:50.178 --> 01:07:51.859
SAM: Only I can say it.

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:57.137
(laughter)

01:07:57.137 --> 01:08:02.917
SAM: For everyone has their own magic word, and it
won't work with you.

01:08:03.343 --> 01:08:10.241
(vocalizing, trills)

01:08:10.241 --> 01:08:15.129
By the ancient order of the school, fibulous!

01:08:16.975 --> 01:08:20.568
LIAM: That is a silver coin right there.

01:08:20.568 --> 01:08:29.813
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Wait a minute. Does this mean
the silver I won from you was actually copper?

01:08:29.813 --> 01:08:32.013
SAM: No, it only works up.

01:08:32.013 --> 01:08:34.810
LAURA: Great! Thanks for the silver.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:41.166
SAM: Well, no, we weren't giving you the silver
piece just showing you a bit of magic. This pot is

01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:46.030
actually quite powerful. It can do that once a
day, so if you'd like to purchase it.

01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:48.879
LAURA: Can you turn this into a gold piece?

01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:51.237
SAM: Well, it only works once a day.

01:08:51.237 --> 01:08:54.533
LAURA: Well, tomorrow can you make it gold?

01:08:54.533 --> 01:08:58.484
SAM: I think it only does the copper to silver?

01:08:58.484 --> 01:09:01.826
LIAM: The magic is not that strong.

01:09:01.826 --> 01:09:08.929
SAM: Yes, it's a mild magic pot. But if you'd like
to purchase it from us, we can sell it to you for

01:09:08.929 --> 01:09:11.214
five gold.

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:15.405
LAURA: Five gold for one silver a day? That
doesn't add up.

01:09:15.405 --> 01:09:17.530
TRAVIS: By the end of the week you made your money
back.

01:09:17.530 --> 01:09:19.457
LAURA: No.

01:09:22.207 --> 01:09:25.485
SAM: At discount for friends, three gold.

01:09:25.672 --> 01:09:29.246
LAURA: Three gold.

01:09:29.246 --> 01:09:32.994
SAM: And for that, we'll teach you your own magic
word.

01:09:32.994 --> 01:09:35.574
LAURA: That's pretty good.

01:09:35.574 --> 01:09:37.990
TALIESIN: That's 40 days.

01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:39.468
LAURA: 40 days?

01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:42.376
SAM: You can do it once a day forever, you have it
for the rest of your life.

01:09:42.376 --> 01:09:45.020
LAURA: Yeah, but I have lots of money. I don't
need it.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.808
SAM: But this is free money, that you don't have
to work for.

01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:52.886
LIAM: Also, you know, they basically helped us out
today. You can do it for one, for them.

01:09:52.886 --> 01:09:55.163
SAM: All right, one gold.

01:09:55.163 --> 01:10:02.820
LAURA: One gold. That's a really good deal. Did
you hear how much he gave me a deal? Okay!

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.965
MATT: Do you give him the gold?

01:10:07.216 --> 01:10:12.647
LAURA: Yes, I'll give him the gold. Hold on, let
me make sure I have it. Where's my--?

01:10:12.647 --> 01:10:14.371
TALIESIN: It's the second button.

01:10:14.371 --> 01:10:19.762
LAURA: Oh, currency! Gold. Okay, one down.

01:10:19.762 --> 01:10:23.346
MARISHA: Do I notice anything shifty about that,
while we were looking at his hands?

01:10:23.346 --> 01:10:25.934
MATT: Perception check.

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:27.976
LAURA: What's my magic word?

01:10:27.976 --> 01:10:31.001
LIAM: It can be whatever you want it to be. You
have to agree upon it and you have to focus on

01:10:31.001 --> 01:10:34.351
that word for one full day while you are in
possession of the pot.

01:10:34.351 --> 01:10:35.391
MARISHA: 21.

01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:40.223
MATT: You watch that copper piece become silver,
magically.

01:10:40.223 --> 01:10:43.671
LAURA: How about skinky doodie?

01:10:43.846 --> 01:10:49.733
LIAM: Skinky doodie, that is unique. I'm sure no
one else has possession of that arcane power word.

01:10:49.922 --> 01:10:55.104
I could consider it yours if you focused on it all
day tomorrow. But you really have to focus.

01:10:55.104 --> 01:11:05.170
LAURA: Okay, I will. Super a lot of focus. Skinky
doodie. Thank you for this.

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:10.766
SAM: It's a pleasure doing business with you. Does
that answer your question? I've got some for you.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:13.982
MARISHA: You have questions for me?

01:11:13.982 --> 01:11:21.318
SAM: Yeah! How does someone like you -- you're
human right?

01:11:21.318 --> 01:11:22.711
MARISHA: Yeah, I am.

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:26.649
SAM: How do you come by learning Halfling?

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:36.697
MARISHA: My parents were in the winery business.
The wine making business. And halflings really

01:11:36.697 --> 01:11:38.705
like wine.

01:11:38.705 --> 01:11:40.794
SAM: Everyone likes wine!

01:11:40.794 --> 01:11:42.810
MARISHA: That's true.

01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:45.143
TRAVIS: Some people more than others.

01:11:45.143 --> 01:11:52.123
MARISHA: Some halflings just deal in wine a lot,
and a lot did in the town that I'm from and then

01:11:52.123 --> 01:11:56.503
my parents wanted me to keep up with the books and
all that stuff so it forced me to learn halfling.

01:11:56.503 --> 01:11:58.226
I was around it a lot.

01:11:58.226 --> 01:12:00.605
SAM: What town was that then?

01:12:00.605 --> 01:12:03.735
LAURA: It's close by here, right?

01:12:03.735 --> 01:12:07.897
MARISHA: It's a bit aways. It's Kamordah.

01:12:07.897 --> 01:12:10.034
SAM: Hmm, haven't heard of it.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:14.566
MARISHA: It's a small farming town, it's no big
deal. It's whatever.

01:12:16.186 --> 01:12:18.422
SAM: Nothing shady there!

01:12:19.874 --> 01:12:25.849
MARISHA: Nope, just a wandering traveler just like
the rest of y'all.

01:12:25.849 --> 01:12:29.436
TRAVIS: Well I mean I was really impressed with
the little trick, I sure would like to see a big

01:12:29.436 --> 01:12:30.564
trick.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.624
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows!

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:41.630
MATT: Being about one o'clock in the morning at
this time, and the energy in the tavern has come

01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:45.982
to a quiet crawl, those who are keeping their cups
are either snoring or in the process of preparing

01:12:45.982 --> 01:12:51.724
to go to sleep, you watch as Adelaine, the
barmaid is walking around cleaning up tables and

01:12:52.939 --> 01:12:59.323
suddenly all the windows in the room slam open
with a heavy impact and there's a burst of wind

01:12:59.323 --> 01:13:05.592
that comes through. The two crownsguard that were
outside flanking the opening doorway suddenly rush

01:13:05.592 --> 01:13:09.392
and look in and look about at the lot of you.

01:13:09.392 --> 01:13:15.630
TALIESIN: Sorry! Drinking! I did order two extra.
Two extra?

01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:18.568
MATT: They both just slowly curl back to their
perimeter.

01:13:18.568 --> 01:13:20.233
TALIESIN: You're no fun.

01:13:20.233 --> 01:13:27.645
MARISHA: Yeah, circus! Woo, circus coming to
town!

01:13:27.645 --> 01:13:30.834
TRAVIS: Jester, I meant a trick from Caleb.

01:13:30.834 --> 01:13:33.473
LAURA: Oh.

01:13:34.334 --> 01:13:36.178
LIAM: You want to see a trick?

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:38.393
TRAVIS: I would love one.

01:13:38.393 --> 01:13:46.016
LIAM: I am well into my second trost at this
point. I can show you a trick. Young lady, if you

01:13:46.016 --> 01:13:48.832
would assist me please. Step up onto the table.

01:13:48.832 --> 01:13:50.458
SAM: Absolutely!

01:13:50.458 --> 01:13:52.524
MARISHA: Just don't break anything.

01:13:52.524 --> 01:14:02.850
LIAM: Adjust your minds. I begin to weave one hand
in a slow circle around the other, and a globe of

01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:05.431
golden light poofs out.

01:14:05.431 --> 01:14:12.659
SAM: I put my hands and feet out in an akimbo
pose.

01:14:12.659 --> 01:14:15.668
LIAM: A second little globule of light comes out.

01:14:15.668 --> 01:14:18.858
SAM: I feel it coming! Hit me!

01:14:18.858 --> 01:14:26.279
LIAM: Then two more at the same time come out of
my hand. Then they amass upon my little companion

01:14:26.279 --> 01:14:36.476
and form a similar sized little humanoid of light
that then coincides with my little friend. She is

01:14:36.476 --> 01:14:40.512
glowing golden on a table in the middle of the
Nestled Nook.

01:14:40.512 --> 01:14:44.561
SAM: (sings)

01:14:44.561 --> 01:14:47.500
LIAM: The Goblight, ladies and gentlemen. The
Goblight!

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.417
SAM: Thank you!

01:14:49.417 --> 01:14:54.596
MATT: There's some claps in the back rooms. You
see one of the drunken gentlemen has come to

01:14:54.596 --> 01:14:58.550
semi-consciousness and goes, "That's impressive!"
(&lt;i&gt;hic&lt;/i&gt;)

01:14:58.550 --> 01:15:00.990
Then passes back out on the table.

01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:03.490
TRAVIS: How did you learn to do that?

01:15:04.371 --> 01:15:15.911
LIAM: I could always do that a little bit, as a
kid. I was always good with magic. I had a knack

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:18.549
for it. That one's easy.

01:15:18.549 --> 01:15:21.315
TRAVIS: That's impressive.

01:15:21.315 --> 01:15:23.885
LIAM: Well, thank you.

01:15:25.147 --> 01:15:27.602
MARISHA: Aw buddy.

01:15:27.602 --> 01:15:30.352
LAURA: Maybe he can teach you how to do that.

01:15:30.352 --> 01:15:34.091
TRAVIS: Is it something that can be taught to
others?

01:15:34.091 --> 01:15:37.021
TALIESIN: Are you trying to learn magic? Is that a
thing?

01:15:37.021 --> 01:15:43.012
TRAVIS: Well, I'm just a little curious about
how people use their magic.

01:15:43.202 --> 01:15:49.996
MARISHA: I've seen you have a few tricks up your
sleeve. You seem like you're not totally magic inept.

01:15:49.996 --> 01:15:56.693
TRAVIS: No, it's relatively new for me though, so
I'm just trying to learn.

01:15:56.693 --> 01:15:58.902
LIAM: Are you reading a lot?

01:15:58.902 --> 01:16:02.913
TRAVIS: No, I wonder if maybe I should be?

01:16:02.913 --> 01:16:12.052
LIAM: Well, it could be helpful. Although, I'm a
bit of an amateur teacher. I taught Nott the one

01:16:12.052 --> 01:16:15.849
trick you saw, but other things. We've been
working together, I suppose I could try to help

01:16:15.849 --> 01:16:17.406
you.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:21.842
MARISHA: Have you had your abilities your whole
life, like a kid?

01:16:21.842 --> 01:16:27.920
TRAVIS: No. Again, fairly recently.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.062
MARISHA: Something happen?

01:16:31.062 --> 01:16:33.547
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:16:34.408 --> 01:16:40.364
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry, do you two not know each
other super well? You seem like you do.

01:16:40.364 --> 01:16:44.353
MARISHA: We got a good 24-48 hours on the rest of
you.

01:16:44.353 --> 01:16:46.333
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not super deep.

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:49.120
MARISHA: Nope.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.475
SAM: Where did you come from then?

01:16:52.475 --> 01:16:56.302
TRAVIS: Well I came up from the town of Port
Damali.

01:16:56.302 --> 01:16:58.167
LAURA: That's where we met!

01:16:58.167 --> 01:17:04.052
TRAVIS: Yeah, I met Jester a while back and after I
Ieft town, coming up to the northeast, I ran

01:17:05.091 --> 01:17:10.916
across her. I'd seen her do some of her magic
before. That's what I'm trying to learn about.

01:17:10.916 --> 01:17:15.131
LAURA: If you need anymore displays, you just let
me know.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:18.394
LIAM: We've seen that window thing a couple times.
It's good.

01:17:18.394 --> 01:17:28.188
MARISHA: Can I request a display? I think I have a
broken rib. It might be getting more purple.

01:17:28.188 --> 01:17:32.764
LAURA: Oh yeah, I mean I can ask, but I think I'm
tapped.

01:17:32.764 --> 01:17:37.019
MARISHA: I'll sleep it off, it's fine.

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:54.607
LAURA: Yeah. I can try! I'll put my hand out. I'll
try to cast Cure Wounds. I got shit. I got

01:17:54.607 --> 01:17:58.170
nothing. It's not happening.

01:17:58.170 --> 01:17:59.910
SAM: It's past midnight!

01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:02.275
LAURA: Oh, no. I've got to sleep.

01:18:02.275 --> 01:18:05.207
MATT: You concentrate for a moment. Make a
medicine check.

01:18:05.207 --> 01:18:07.046
LAURA: Okay!

01:18:09.467 --> 01:18:12.370
SAM: Natural 12!

01:18:12.370 --> 01:18:14.636
LAURA: That's 17.

01:18:14.636 --> 01:18:23.992
MATT: 17. You focus on the bruised area, exposed
out of her monk robes. You watch as the slight

01:18:23.992 --> 01:18:27.076
bruising suddenly turns like a sickly green.

01:18:27.824 --> 01:18:29.482
SAM: Is that good?

01:18:29.482 --> 01:18:32.629
MATT: In a very unhealthy way.

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:45.121
LAURA: You know what? I think this might be worse
than just like a bruised rib. Can I poke it? Does

01:18:45.121 --> 01:18:47.274
it seem infected?

01:18:47.274 --> 01:18:48.545
MARISHA: Does it hurt?

01:18:48.545 --> 01:18:52.786
LAURA: I'm not going to poke it with my finger,
though, I'm going to poke at it with a fork.

01:18:52.786 --> 01:18:57.156
MARISHA: Don't poke at me with a fork!

01:18:57.156 --> 01:19:03.677
MATT: Right now, she's inspecting it. You take a
fork off the table and poke.

01:19:03.694 --> 01:19:05.315
MARISHA: No, you don't!

01:19:05.315 --> 01:19:09.416
LAURA: I'll use the blunt end, don't be such a
baby!

01:19:09.753 --> 01:19:16.162
MATT: She pushes it in and the bruise hurts a bit.
You watch as this sickly pus liquid begins to pour

01:19:16.162 --> 01:19:23.492
out, with a thick viscosity and a lot of it. You
all of the sudden feel like you've punctured a

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:28.357
balloon that's beginning to erupt and you feel
awful. Then you blink a few times and it's just a

01:19:28.357 --> 01:19:33.530
bruise. You hear this distant (cackling).

01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:36.549
LAURA: Oh, motherfucker, he's such a dick!

01:19:36.549 --> 01:19:40.402
SAM: What? Who? What? What's going on?

01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:44.047
MARISHA: My bruise is in the shape of a dick?

01:19:44.047 --> 01:19:45.814
LAURA: That would be really cool.

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:48.308
MARISHA: That would be fun!

01:19:48.308 --> 01:19:53.851
LAURA: I'm just going make sure, I'm going to push
on it a bit more. I think it's okay, you're fine.

01:19:53.851 --> 01:19:56.831
MARISHA: All right. I'll sleep it off.

01:19:56.831 --> 01:19:59.813
LAURA: I think I need some sleep, you guys.

01:19:59.813 --> 01:20:04.928
LIAM: Gustav, the person who runs the circus, is
he your friend?

01:20:04.928 --> 01:20:06.001
TALIESIN: He's family.

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:07.321
LIAM: He's family?

01:20:07.321 --> 01:20:09.521
TALIESIN: We take care of each other. He's a good
man.

01:20:09.521 --> 01:20:12.493
LIAM: So what's your play tomorrow?

01:20:12.493 --> 01:20:19.044
TALIESIN: Well, they have all my things and they
have all my family. I'm going to figure out what is

01:20:19.044 --> 01:20:26.111
going on. Try and find out what's actually doing
this. I assume since it's none of us, it's going

01:20:26.111 --> 01:20:27.932
to happen again.

01:20:27.932 --> 01:20:31.019
LAURA: But how can we because we can't leave this
tavern?

01:20:31.019 --> 01:20:35.585
TALIESIN: Well, I--

01:20:35.585 --> 01:20:40.375
SAM: Were Caleb and I not instructed not to leave
the tavern? We received no formal instruction.

01:20:40.375 --> 01:20:42.684
MATT: No, you weren't part of that formal
instruction. The rest of you were told not to

01:20:42.684 --> 01:20:44.305
leave the tavern until further notice.

01:20:44.305 --> 01:20:46.537
TALIESIN: I'm sure if we sleep on it, we'll think
of something.

01:20:46.537 --> 01:20:51.904
LAURA: Fjord! You and I could leave in the morning
the same way we got in.

01:20:51.904 --> 01:20:53.456
TRAVIS: That's true.

01:20:53.456 --> 01:20:54.899
SAM: How'd you get in?

01:20:54.899 --> 01:21:00.392
LAURA: With magic. I would show you now, but I'm
out of spells!

01:21:00.392 --> 01:21:03.440
SAM: The fork trick wasn't very fun, was it?

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:08.139
LAURA: No. I was making sure she wasn't a zombie.
I thought she might be.

01:21:08.139 --> 01:21:10.181
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:21:10.181 --> 01:21:11.411
LAURA: She got clawed, right?

01:21:11.411 --> 01:21:12.936
TALIESIN: A bit, yeah.

01:21:12.936 --> 01:21:17.598
LAURA: All right. Hey bitches, I'm going to go to
bed.

01:21:17.598 --> 01:21:26.821
TALIESIN: Where exactly am I going to be sleeping,
by the way? I can sleep down here, but it might be nice--

01:21:26.821 --> 01:21:30.324
TRAVIS: Molly, if you would like to share my room,
you can.

01:21:30.324 --> 01:21:37.384
TALIESIN: Excellent. You don't mind? I'm going to
pull the swords off finally and start getting

01:21:37.384 --> 01:21:41.293
comfortable out of the performance clothes.

01:21:41.293 --> 01:21:47.381
MARISHA: I'm in Jester's room, still, I think.
Sleeping on the floor on my bedroll.

01:21:47.381 --> 01:21:54.661
LAURA: As she starts to go to sleep, I want to
draw in my sketchbook and tell the Traveler all

01:21:54.661 --> 01:22:01.493
about the cool things I saw for the day. I'm going
to draw the red faced guard as I pretended I was a

01:22:01.493 --> 01:22:11.745
zombie, and I'm going to draw Molly's horns all
full of jewels and stuff! I'm going to draw the

01:22:11.745 --> 01:22:14.323
stack of books.

01:22:14.323 --> 01:22:17.066
SAM: The monster attack?

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:24.430
LAURA: And I'm going to draw like a zombie, but
like as an old man but as he's biting his dentures

01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:28.534
fall out and he's not no teeth!

01:22:28.534 --> 01:22:32.922
MATT: All righty. Fairly decent sketches,
actually. You eventually find yourself to sleep.

01:22:32.922 --> 01:22:41.157
The rest of you, go to your respective rooms and
find yourselves falling into a night's rest. As

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:45.481
evening comes to a close and the morning brings
you to consciousness, you are rested. You are

01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:48.249
healed up, your spells are restored.

01:22:48.249 --> 01:22:51.626
SAM: I can use the Long Rest feature of D&amp;D
Beyond!

01:22:51.626 --> 01:22:55.148
MARISHA: You hit a button!

01:22:55.148 --> 01:22:56.456
LAURA: And all my spells back!

01:22:56.456 --> 01:22:57.732
TALIESIN: There is a button for it.

01:22:57.732 --> 01:23:08.250
SAM: Whoa, nothing changed! No spells. I lost ten
hit points?! What the fuck?! I've done something

01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:09.683
terribly wrong.

01:23:09.683 --> 01:23:11.538
(laughter)

01:23:11.538 --> 01:23:15.971
TRAVIS: D&amp;D Beyond's watching going, "Fuck you,
Nott!"

01:23:15.971 --> 01:23:19.782
LAURA: Wait no, you're putting temporary hit
points on! What are you doing?

01:23:19.782 --> 01:23:23.174
SAM: We'll work on this during the break.

01:23:23.174 --> 01:23:27.215
LIAM: Self destruct in 10, nine.

01:23:27.215 --> 01:23:29.565
MARISHA: He just throws the iPad.

01:23:29.565 --> 01:23:34.477
MATT: Coming to consciousness in your respective
rooms, cold morning air. It's a bit frosty. The

01:23:34.477 --> 01:23:42.774
windows to each of your rooms have a bit of that
curled bit of frost on the outskirts of the glass.

01:23:42.774 --> 01:23:47.740
It's probably 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning at this
point in time and the day is yours. What do you

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:48.931
wish to do?

01:23:48.931 --> 01:23:52.514
MARISHA: As I wake up, I sit up and I go: Jester?

01:23:52.514 --> 01:23:54.700
LAURA: Hmm?

01:23:54.700 --> 01:24:02.482
MARISHA: Were you laughing to yourself last night?
I just kept hearing giggling. It was obnoxious.

01:24:02.482 --> 01:24:03.864
LAURA: I'm sorry.

01:24:03.864 --> 01:24:08.373
MARISHA: Uh-huh. I just get ready.

01:24:08.373 --> 01:24:11.836
MATT: As a note, too, for all the drinks you guys
drank last night, that probably put you back about

01:24:11.836 --> 01:24:13.702
one and a half gold.

01:24:13.702 --> 01:24:16.724
TRAVIS: Molly, that's your tab, right?

01:24:16.724 --> 01:24:19.836
TALIESIN: All but the one you bought me.

01:24:19.836 --> 01:24:23.201
TRAVIS: Yeah, except for that one.

01:24:23.201 --> 01:24:26.755
TALIESIN: To be fair, I didn't give you that
story.

01:24:26.755 --> 01:24:29.474
TRAVIS: That's true.

01:24:29.474 --> 01:24:35.229
TALIESIN: I very carefully start unfolding my robe
and it has my swords very carefully laid out in

01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:41.530
there from the closet. I do a little prayer and
put everything back on.

01:24:41.530 --> 01:24:44.021
TRAVIS: Are you praying over your swords?

01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:46.161
TALIESIN: I am, of course.

01:24:46.161 --> 01:24:52.519
TRAVIS: Is that part of your thing?

01:24:52.519 --> 01:24:54.242
TALIESIN: You seem honest.

01:24:54.242 --> 01:24:55.611
TRAVIS: I try to be.

01:24:55.611 --> 01:25:05.864
TALIESIN: Well, the swords are magic. According to
my mum, they go back in our family generations to

01:25:05.864 --> 01:25:14.753
a very unusual rare line of tiefling that came
from a demon of ice that lived inside a volcano.

01:25:14.753 --> 01:25:22.895
Our family, and I take this with a grain of salt,
were royal guards, were entrusted with these magic

01:25:22.895 --> 01:25:30.696
swords and these swords can only be activated by
the blood of the royal family. So in honor of any

01:25:30.696 --> 01:25:36.885
fighting I ever do with them, I make sure my blood
is at least drawn once.

01:25:36.885 --> 01:25:39.042
TRAVIS: That's quite the story. Can I insight
check him?

01:25:39.042 --> 01:25:41.432
MATT: Yes, you may.

01:25:43.562 --> 01:25:44.708
TRAVIS: 15.

01:25:44.708 --> 01:25:46.570
TALIESIN: What am I fighting against?

01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:48.195
MATT: This would be deception.

01:25:48.195 --> 01:25:56.540
TALIESIN: That would be deception. All right. I'm
lying like a motherfucker.

01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:01.280
TRAVIS: Well thank you for sharing that
honest story with me. It means a lot.

01:26:06.634 --> 01:26:08.275
TALIESIN: I walk downstairs.

01:26:08.275 --> 01:26:09.693
MATT: All right.

01:26:09.693 --> 01:26:11.625
LAURA: Can I go knock on Fjord's door?

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:13.132
MATT: Sure.

01:26:13.132 --> 01:26:17.250
LAURA: Ey oh ey, good morning!

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:21.235
SAM: She's a morning person too? Jesus.

01:26:21.235 --> 01:26:23.793
TRAVIS: Ey oh ey yourself.

01:26:23.793 --> 01:26:29.533
(laughter)

01:26:29.533 --> 01:26:32.508
LAURA: Hey, do you want to get out of here?

01:26:32.508 --> 01:26:36.331
TRAVIS: Yeah, we said we were going to do that,
didn't we? What did you have in mind?

01:26:36.331 --> 01:26:41.577
LAURA: Well, we sneak out and then we go find out
why there are zombies.

01:26:41.577 --> 01:26:42.992
TRAVIS: That's a detailed plan.

01:26:42.992 --> 01:26:44.298
LAURA: Yes.

01:26:44.298 --> 01:26:46.492
TRAVIS: I like it. Are we taking anybody with us?

01:26:46.492 --> 01:26:49.891
LAURA: Well, if they can make themselves not look
like themselves, then sure.

01:26:49.891 --> 01:26:53.924
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Do you want to ask any of
them?

01:26:53.924 --> 01:26:54.974
LAURA: Hey, Beau.

01:26:54.974 --> 01:26:56.067
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:26:56.067 --> 01:27:03.164
LAURA: Do you have anything you can do to make
yourself not look like you?

01:27:03.164 --> 01:27:09.481
MARISHA: I take my robes and I flip them inside
out and I take some dirt and dirty it up a little

01:27:09.481 --> 01:27:18.651
bit and take my hair down and I steal
a scarf off of Jester's stuff and I do a

01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:21.161
bandana around my head.

01:27:21.161 --> 01:27:24.328
LAURA: No, you look like you with a bandana around
your head.

01:27:24.328 --> 01:27:28.440
TRAVIS: Yeah that's not going to cut it, not quite
like what we had in mind.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.925
LAURA: Yeah.

01:27:29.925 --> 01:27:32.963
MARISHA: What are you guys doing? You guys
leaving? Are you guys fucking leaving? You're not

01:27:32.963 --> 01:27:34.914
leaving without me are you?

01:27:34.914 --> 01:27:36.157
LAURA: No, of course, we're coming back.

01:27:36.157 --> 01:27:37.263
MARISHA: You're skipping town.

01:27:37.263 --> 01:27:39.154
LAURA: No. Oh, but we could.

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:40.509
TRAVIS: She's right here.

01:27:40.509 --> 01:27:42.390
LAURA: Okay.

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:44.594
MARISHA: I could skip town with you, though. Do
you want to skip town?

01:27:44.594 --> 01:27:50.944
LAURA: We'll be back.

01:27:50.944 --> 01:27:56.574
TRAVIS: Let's see if Caleb and his little friend
are downstairs first. He has tricks after all.

01:27:56.574 --> 01:27:58.216
LAURA: Right.

01:27:58.216 --> 01:28:03.113
MATT: Okay, the two of you come to consciousness.
What are you up to?

01:28:03.113 --> 01:28:04.742
SAM: Get some breakfast, I guess?

01:28:04.742 --> 01:28:06.126
LIAM: Yeah, we're already down there.

01:28:06.126 --> 01:28:07.527
MATT: You've already gone down there?

01:28:07.527 --> 01:28:11.592
TALIESIN: I've already gone. I'm having breakfast.
I'm leaving a note with the barkeep for Yasha if

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:12.764
she comes back.

01:28:12.764 --> 01:28:13.935
MATT: Okay.

01:28:13.935 --> 01:28:16.048
MARISHA: I guess I go down and have breakfast as
well.

01:28:16.048 --> 01:28:19.844
MATT: As you guys wander down you find Caleb and
Nott already at a table and Mollymauk returning

01:28:19.844 --> 01:28:26.263
from the bar after delivering that note.

01:28:26.263 --> 01:28:27.706
TRAVIS: Y'all are downstairs?

01:28:27.706 --> 01:28:32.468
SAM: (messy eating noises)

01:28:32.468 --> 01:28:34.555
LAURA: Can I try to pick a piece of bacon off your
plate?

01:28:34.555 --> 01:28:37.947
SAM: (growls) Sure, for you.

01:28:37.947 --> 01:28:40.417
LAURA: Thanks.

01:28:40.417 --> 01:28:51.940
TRAVIS: It's like a little dog. The little back
foot creeps up. (growls) If we could we're-- did

01:28:51.940 --> 01:29:05.012
you just fucking? Shit. We were thinking of maybe
finding our way outside of the inn for a bit. I

01:29:05.012 --> 01:29:11.295
don't want to presume anything, but do you have
the ability to change the way you look?

01:29:11.295 --> 01:29:13.848
LIAM: To change the way I look?

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:15.138
TRAVIS: Yeah. You know

01:29:15.138 --> 01:29:16.227
LIAM: To leave the inn?

01:29:16.227 --> 01:29:17.210
TRAVIS: Yeah, assume a different form.

01:29:17.210 --> 01:29:18.963
LIAM: Why would I do that to leave the inn?

01:29:18.963 --> 01:29:20.752
LAURA: So we can find out why there are zombies.

01:29:20.752 --> 01:29:23.726
LIAM: Why wouldn't I just walk out of the inn?

01:29:23.726 --> 01:29:25.903
LAURA: Well, because we were told we can't leave
the inn.

01:29:25.903 --> 01:29:27.998
SAM: We weren't told that.

01:29:27.998 --> 01:29:29.246
TRAVIS: Right.

01:29:29.246 --> 01:29:31.487
LAURA: Huh. Well, that's convenient.

01:29:31.487 --> 01:29:35.813
SAM: But I can change my appearance.

01:29:35.813 --> 01:29:38.898
LAURA: Wow. I would never know it was you.

01:29:38.898 --> 01:29:42.479
SAM: Yeah.

01:29:42.479 --> 01:29:45.887
TRAVIS: Molly, what about you?

01:29:45.887 --> 01:29:55.264
TALIESIN: Well, I mean look at me. I go into my
bag. I do have a disguise kit. Don't I? I think I

01:29:55.264 --> 01:30:04.469
do. It's so weird to just have things now. Yeah, I
have a disguise kit.

01:30:04.469 --> 01:30:05.932
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:30:05.932 --> 01:30:07.632
SAM: What does that mean?

01:30:07.632 --> 01:30:11.748
MATT: It means he can use to try and disguise
himself. Hide features.

01:30:11.748 --> 01:30:14.757
TALIESIN: It'd be a little tricky for me. I 
look like what I'm going to look like.

01:30:14.757 --> 01:30:17.812
But the rest of you could do a little work.

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:20.921
TRAVIS: Beau, I don't want to leave you behind,
but I--

01:30:20.921 --> 01:30:23.185
LAURA: It's true. I have a disguise kit, too. I
could help you out.

01:30:23.448 --> 01:30:26.909
MARISHA: Would you do my makeup for me?

01:30:26.909 --> 01:30:28.253
LAURA: I'm really good at makeup.

01:30:28.253 --> 01:30:29.123
MARISHA: Are you?

01:30:29.123 --> 01:30:29.816
LAURA: Yeah.

01:30:29.816 --> 01:30:30.785
MARISHA: Let's do that.

01:30:30.785 --> 01:30:32.300
LAURA: I'm really shit at makeup.

01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:34.575
(laughter)

01:30:34.575 --> 01:30:37.637
TALIESIN: We could just shower this one that would
be enough.

01:30:37.637 --> 01:30:40.422
LAURA: He can leave, apparently.

01:30:40.422 --> 01:30:44.552
LIAM: Yeah, we could. But not town, we were told
to stay in town.

01:30:44.552 --> 01:30:47.278
LAURA: No, no, we're going to stay in town.

01:30:47.278 --> 01:30:48.888
SAM: What are we doing again?

01:30:48.888 --> 01:30:52.923
LAURA: We have to find out why there are zombies
so we that don't get arrested for being zombies.

01:30:52.923 --> 01:30:58.521
SAM: So we solve the case to clear our own name.

01:30:58.521 --> 01:31:05.785
LIAM: Why shouldn't we just wait for it all to
blow over? We didn't do anything.

01:31:05.785 --> 01:31:09.750
TALIESIN: I tend to find these things don't blow over
necessarily as more they just eventually decide

01:31:09.843 --> 01:31:12.247
someone's guilty and take their revenge on them.

01:31:12.247 --> 01:31:14.054
LIAM: Do you find yourself in situations like this
often?

01:31:14.054 --> 01:31:16.913
TALIESIN: Not this particular one, but yes.

01:31:16.913 --> 01:31:19.425
MARISHA: I mean, look at him. No offense or
anything.

01:31:19.425 --> 01:31:24.437
TALIESIN: None taken, really. A little taken, but
that's fine.

01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:27.676
TRAVIS: He makes a point. I think that the sooner
we find the cause of this, the sooner we can get

01:31:27.676 --> 01:31:30.007
out of here.

01:31:30.007 --> 01:31:34.177
TALIESIN: She's right, immediately the two of us
are going to get hit with this.

01:31:34.177 --> 01:31:39.528
SAM: If we solve the case we would be absolved.
It's not a terrible plan.

01:31:39.528 --> 01:31:43.640
MARISHA: And you're so concerned with your goblin
friend. I mean he's in the same boat as the

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:44.624
tieflings.

01:31:44.624 --> 01:31:46.575
LIAM: That's a girl.

01:31:46.575 --> 01:31:47.967
LAURA: I know it's hard to tell.

01:31:47.967 --> 01:31:49.853
MARISHA: I said your goblin friend.

01:31:49.853 --> 01:31:50.853
LAURA and LAURA: You said he.

01:31:50.853 --> 01:31:52.424
MARISHA: Whatever.

01:31:52.424 --> 01:31:59.037
SAM: Listen, we've all had a rough night. I know
that my features aren't necessarily the most

01:31:59.465 --> 01:32:08.453
feminine. Among goblin kind, I understand. It's
hard to tell.

01:32:08.453 --> 01:32:09.611
LAURA: I can tell.

01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:11.762
LIAM: Everybody can tell.

01:32:11.762 --> 01:32:13.467
LAURA: Yeah.

01:32:13.467 --> 01:32:16.236
MARISHA: I'm working on it.

01:32:16.236 --> 01:32:23.894
TRAVIS: Let's get out of here. Can I walk back
into a privy, washroom area?

01:32:23.894 --> 01:32:27.891
MATT: Yeah, upstairs at the very end of the hall
is the communal washroom.

01:32:27.891 --> 01:32:32.511
TRAVIS: Can I use my Mask of Many Faces to cast
Disguise Self on myself?

01:32:32.511 --> 01:32:34.176
MATT: Sure, what form so you want to take?

01:32:34.176 --> 01:32:41.443
TRAVIS: Older, white-haired, with a beard. Just
very simple peasant's clothes. Maybe a bit of a

01:32:41.443 --> 01:32:43.458
farmer or a land worker.

01:32:43.458 --> 01:32:52.559
MATT: Okay, easily enough. Basic browns and tans
and general farm worker's tunic and supplies.

01:32:52.559 --> 01:32:53.937
TRAVIS: Smudges, dirt on the fingernails.

01:32:53.937 --> 01:32:55.810
MATT: Yeah, easy enough.

01:32:55.810 --> 01:33:01.319
LAURA: I'm going to help Beau. You know what I'm
going to do for you? I'm going to use my disguise

01:33:01.319 --> 01:33:03.512
kit I'm going to give you a beard.

01:33:03.512 --> 01:33:04.957
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

01:33:04.957 --> 01:33:10.062
LAURA: Yeah and I'm going to turn you into a dude,
that's a good disguise, right?

01:33:10.062 --> 01:33:10.881
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:33:10.881 --> 01:33:15.510
LAURA. Yeah, and a mustache. And a hat.

01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:17.227
MARISHA: Love it.

01:33:17.227 --> 01:33:21.281
SAM: You really have to sell it though, and act
like a dude.

01:33:21.281 --> 01:33:24.457
MARISHA: (low, gravelly voice) I think I can do that.

01:33:24.457 --> 01:33:26.029
SAM: Oh yes!

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:32.337
MARISHA: I'm going to go a step further and tape
down my boobs, bandage them down all the way, you

01:33:32.337 --> 01:33:36.042
know wrap them. Stuff my crotch a little bit.

01:33:36.042 --> 01:33:40.917
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a dexterity
check.

01:33:40.917 --> 01:33:44.317
TALIESIN: Do you want assistance with this?

01:33:44.317 --> 01:33:47.476
LAURA: Was he helping me?

01:33:47.476 --> 01:33:48.819
MATT: If you want to.

01:33:48.819 --> 01:33:49.789
LAURA: Sure.

01:33:49.789 --> 01:33:51.292
MATT: So take it with advantage.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:52.430
TALIESIN: Oh, with advantage.

01:33:52.430 --> 01:34:02.132
LAURA: Good. Okay, with the advantage. Dexterity.
15.

01:34:02.132 --> 01:34:06.190
MATT: 15, okay. You actually manage to sell a
decent disguise.

01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:08.599
MARISHA: Do I have some five o'clock shadow?

01:34:08.599 --> 01:34:15.571
MATT: At a distance, at like three or four feet
would be passable and walking quickly by. Upon

01:34:15.571 --> 01:34:17.868
close inspection, you could see through it.

01:34:17.868 --> 01:34:21.328
LIAM: Is it like one of those old kids toys where
you use the magnet to pull the little filings up?

01:34:21.328 --> 01:34:22.394
MATT: More or less.

01:34:22.394 --> 01:34:24.515
MARISHA: Mr. Woolly?

01:34:24.515 --> 01:34:27.016
MATT: A medieval version of that.

01:34:27.016 --> 01:34:28.978
LIAM: Herr Woolly.

01:34:28.978 --> 01:34:32.893
MATT: But impressive. Using the kit and using
whatever scraps of clothing you can find and amass

01:34:32.893 --> 01:34:41.928
you manage to get a relatively top-knot Silverlake
hobo version of Beau functionally ready to go.

01:34:41.928 --> 01:34:44.928
LAURA: It's good, it's good.

01:34:44.938 --> 01:34:48.395
MARISHA: Wait Fjord how do you sound? Say words,
you're manly.

01:34:49.463 --> 01:34:57.996
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Manly words. Mirror image. I
got nuts.

01:34:57.996 --> 01:35:01.482
(laughter)

01:35:01.482 --> 01:35:17.276
LAURA: And I'll cast Disguise Self on myself, as
well, and turn myself into a human with blonde

01:35:17.276 --> 01:35:23.875
hair and she's going to be very clean-looking.

01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:26.647
SAM: Angelina.

01:35:26.647 --> 01:35:35.637
LAURA: Yes! With big lips, and a couple jewels on
her fingers.

01:35:35.637 --> 01:35:42.056
MATT: Okay. Just double-checking here, Disguise
Self lasts for, is it an hour? Yeah, I thought it

01:35:42.056 --> 01:35:47.208
was an hour. So while they're doing that, are you
using your disguise kit on yourself?

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:53.986
TALIESIN: I assume I've just got some very basic
black robe that just--

01:35:53.986 --> 01:35:57.910
MATT: Yeah, with a cloak and hood and make-up, you
can probably pass for human as long as you keep

01:35:57.910 --> 01:36:01.396
the hood up, and keep most of your more
ostentatious garb hidden.

01:36:01.396 --> 01:36:03.716
TALIESIN: I'm sure I've got a set.

01:36:03.852 --> 01:36:06.996
MATT: Go ahead and make a dexterity check for your
disguise kit.

01:36:06.996 --> 01:36:07.990
LAURA: Do you want help?

01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:12.770
TALIESIN: Yes please, this is a lot of work. It's
a natural 20, that'll do it.

01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:23.511
MATT: All right. Between making your skin tone
more of a natural tan, peach humanoid color, bring

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:27.646
the hood up. You actually pull some of your hair
forward and adhere it a bit around the horns so

01:36:27.646 --> 01:36:33.303
that it looks almost like a cluster of hair in the
front. You manage to tuck in and tie your robe

01:36:33.303 --> 01:36:39.317
behind you, your usual clothing, and then using an
over-robe to hide most of the material, and you

01:36:39.317 --> 01:36:45.700
look like a dude passing through. So with that
your disguises are complete, your spells are cast.

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:48.379
MARISHA: Is that your human face?

01:36:49.874 --> 01:36:53.249
LIAM: While they're doing all that, I want to
stroll outside and see if there's crownsguard

01:36:53.249 --> 01:36:57.134
outside, or what. I'm just going to get a breath
of fresh air and see what's on the street outside

01:36:57.134 --> 01:36:58.384
of this place.

01:36:58.384 --> 01:37:05.009
MATT: Okay. As you exit, there are two gentlemen
in full crownsguard gear. One is standing outside,

01:37:05.009 --> 01:37:08.419
the other is currently sitting in a chair, and as
soon as you walk past, they both scan you up and

01:37:08.419 --> 01:37:11.289
down, continue to watch you pass by.

01:37:11.289 --> 01:37:15.850
LIAM: Good. There's only just the two at the
door?

01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:17.792
MATT: Just the two that you can see at the front,
yes.

01:37:17.792 --> 01:37:24.561
LIAM: Okay, all right. So I just take a minute or
two. I go back inside. And-- on Nott's shoulder

01:37:24.561 --> 01:37:26.514
and say we're good, yeah, I think we're good.

01:37:26.514 --> 01:37:28.307
SAM: Excellent.

01:37:28.307 --> 01:37:30.974
LAURA: Should we try to do this, then?

01:37:30.974 --> 01:37:32.988
TRAVIS: In twos, or singles.

01:37:32.988 --> 01:37:35.765
LAURA: Yeah, of course, not all at the same time,
that's obvious.

01:37:35.765 --> 01:37:38.023
TRAVIS: Level two, trying to get out of a fucking
inn.

01:37:38.023 --> 01:37:39.688
MARISHA: It's so hard.

01:37:39.688 --> 01:37:41.437
TALIESIN: Now I'm kicking myself.

01:37:41.437 --> 01:37:43.911
MARISHA: So anxiety-inducing.

01:37:43.911 --> 01:37:47.489
TALIESIN: No, never mind, I didn't do it at the
time, I can't do it now. No retconning, never

01:37:47.489 --> 01:37:48.598
mind.

01:37:48.598 --> 01:37:55.102
LIAM: I'm going to squat down over with you,
privately. I still think that this is a bad idea,

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:57.727
but I can tell that you want to.

01:37:57.727 --> 01:38:05.628
SAM: Well it's just that-- listen, there's no
offense, I enjoy our talks and your schooling and

01:38:05.628 --> 01:38:13.390
everything, but I haven't talked this openly and
freely with other people in months. It's amazing.

01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:15.391
LIAM: It really is pretty nice, isn't it?

01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:17.030
SAM: Yes!

01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:19.507
LIAM: Still, if this goes south, we leave.

01:38:19.507 --> 01:38:21.318
SAM: We're the first ones out the door.

01:38:21.318 --> 01:38:22.508
LIAM: Easily.

01:38:22.508 --> 01:38:25.128
SAM: Yeah. They'll never know who we were.

01:38:25.128 --> 01:38:26.746
LIAM: Caleb and Nott.

01:38:26.746 --> 01:38:31.256
SAM: Well, don't say that too much. I mean, yes,
they do know that we're Caleb and Nott, yes.

01:38:31.256 --> 01:38:32.624
LIAM: All right.

01:38:32.624 --> 01:38:33.446
SAM: Okay.

01:38:33.446 --> 01:38:34.332
LIAM: So we're doing this?

01:38:34.332 --> 01:38:38.096
SAM: Yeah, let's just go with, and see where it
leads.

01:38:38.096 --> 01:38:40.319
LAURA: Can I walk up to Nott?

01:38:40.319 --> 01:38:43.033
SAM: Hi! Yes, we weren't talking!

01:38:43.033 --> 01:38:44.821
LAURA: (high-pitched) Do you like my outfit?

01:38:44.821 --> 01:38:50.953
SAM: Oh! What are you? I'm sorry, I'm just a young
girl from the village.

01:38:50.953 --> 01:38:54.110
LAURA: And I'm just a young girl from town.

01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:58.371
SAM: I don't know anything. I should go get my
father.

01:38:58.371 --> 01:39:02.256
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) New York is where I'd
rather stay!

01:39:02.256 --> 01:39:06.669
(laughter)

01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:10.205
LAURA: Nott, it's me! It's Jester!

01:39:10.205 --> 01:39:12.278
SAM: But you look like--

01:39:12.278 --> 01:39:19.525
LAURA: I know! This is how good I am at magic!
Check me out. Are we leaving here or not?

01:39:19.525 --> 01:39:23.128
SAM: Are you afraid you'll be propositioned on the
street?

01:39:23.128 --> 01:39:25.579
LAURA: I am really attractive right now.

01:39:25.579 --> 01:39:28.631
SAM: Those lips are very big.

01:39:29.522 --> 01:39:31.864
LAURA: I came over here to give you the blessing!

01:39:31.864 --> 01:39:33.527
SAM: What is that? What does that do?

01:39:33.527 --> 01:39:35.160
LAURA: It helps you with your stealthing!

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.433
SAM: Oh, the stealthy thing, yes, thank you so
much, I'll accept it.

01:39:38.433 --> 01:39:41.578
LAURA: You're welcome. Okay, that's it. But I'll
see you outside at some point, okay? Don't be

01:39:41.578 --> 01:39:42.975
scared, come up to me.

01:39:42.975 --> 01:39:44.345
SAM and LAURA: Okay.

01:39:44.345 --> 01:39:46.099
MATT: Okay, in what order are you leaving?

01:39:46.099 --> 01:39:47.043
TRAVIS: Should I go first?

01:39:47.043 --> 01:39:48.063
LAURA: Sure!

01:39:48.063 --> 01:39:53.306
MARISHA: Are we going out in pairs? Like you said?
(Deeper) Are we going out in pairs?

01:39:53.306 --> 01:39:56.401
TALIESIN: Has Adelaine noticed any of this?

01:39:56.401 --> 01:40:00.760
MATT: I imagine you guys have been using your
disguise kits in your own rooms and chambers.

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:06.045
Other than that, no one immediately seems to be
noticing. Make a perception check.

01:40:06.045 --> 01:40:08.281
TRAVIS: Not command ops in the tavern hall.

01:40:08.281 --> 01:40:12.396
TALIESIN: Let's call that a--

01:40:12.396 --> 01:40:13.398
LAURA: 14!

01:40:13.398 --> 01:40:15.590
TALIESIN: 14, thank you.

01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:22.278
MATT: You do see Yorda, the barkeep, in the
process of wiping out some glasses at the end,

01:40:22.278 --> 01:40:26.926
she's occasionally giving a glance over to you
guys as you're walking around.

01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:33.550
LAURA: (whispering) You go first!

01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:35.714
TRAVIS: You want to come with?

01:40:35.714 --> 01:40:38.257
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:40:38.257 --> 01:40:50.114
TRAVIS: Don't do anything stupid. Mouth shut, eyes
forward. Show me how you walk. Maybe a little

01:40:50.114 --> 01:40:55.790
less. That's nice. I also assume a little limp,
slight.

01:40:57.007 --> 01:41:01.444
MATT: I'll say for the purpose of this, each of
you make a performance check.

01:41:01.444 --> 01:41:02.917
LAURA: Oh, god.

01:41:08.227 --> 01:41:09.122
TRAVIS: 20.

01:41:13.836 --> 01:41:15.283
MARISHA: 16.

01:41:15.283 --> 01:41:20.234
MATT: Okay. The both of you exit out, holding your
breath. Out of your peripheral you can see the

01:41:20.234 --> 01:41:28.785
deep reds and golds of the crownsguard armor
flanking you as you breach the outer porch of the

01:41:28.785 --> 01:41:40.250
tavern, stepping down into the dust to the main
street. You curve to the left and see nor hear any

01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:42.546
reaction from either of them.

01:41:42.546 --> 01:41:44.896
TRAVIS: Just keep moving to the other side of the
street.

01:41:44.896 --> 01:41:49.053
TALIESIN: I go single just a little bit after, and
I rolled a natural 20.

01:41:49.053 --> 01:41:50.340
SAM: Is that three for the night?

01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:51.224
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:41:51.224 --> 01:41:52.401
SAM: Oh my god.

01:41:52.401 --> 01:41:53.554
TRAVIS: What color is that die?

01:41:53.554 --> 01:41:58.642
TALIESIN: It seems to be iron, like my will.

01:42:00.598 --> 01:42:05.603
MATT: It may not have been the snitch after all,
you asshole.

01:42:05.603 --> 01:42:07.591
TALIESIN: Me and my magic swords.

01:42:07.591 --> 01:42:12.221
MATT: Apparently. All right, you saunter by
without an issue. By saunter, I mean you stumble

01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:18.600
through. You hear a cough at one point, and it
causes you a moment, but you just continue on

01:42:19.042 --> 01:42:20.641
without notice.

01:42:20.641 --> 01:42:23.767
LAURA: Oh, everybody's leaving and I didn't have a
partner!

01:42:23.767 --> 01:42:25.653
MARISHA: It's fine, don't worry about it.

01:42:25.653 --> 01:42:28.377
SAM: You can come with us, if you like.

01:42:28.377 --> 01:42:32.831
LAURA: But I feel like you guys are noticeable and
why would I be this really beautiful woman leaving

01:42:32.831 --> 01:42:36.388
with the stinky guy?

01:42:37.372 --> 01:42:50.104
SAM: It's quickly becoming canon that you just
have shit smeared all over you. You could travel

01:42:50.104 --> 01:42:53.630
with me! I could be your daughter.

01:42:53.630 --> 01:42:54.818
LAURA: You're my daughter!

01:42:54.818 --> 01:43:01.899
SAM: Yes! We're a couple, and he's our guard or
something, I don't know.

01:43:01.899 --> 01:43:05.288
LAURA: Yeah! You leave after us Caleb, okay?

01:43:05.288 --> 01:43:07.318
LIAM: Isn't it simpler for you to walk on yourself
like a beautiful woman?

01:43:07.318 --> 01:43:09.742
LAURA: No, me and Nott are going to go together.
Okay, come on, Nott!

01:43:09.742 --> 01:43:12.674
SAM: I'm sorry, she's very forward.

01:43:12.674 --> 01:43:14.234
LAURA: Come on sweetie, let's go.

01:43:14.234 --> 01:43:15.859
SAM: Yes, mommy!

01:43:15.859 --> 01:43:18.102
LAURA: And we walk out.

01:43:18.102 --> 01:43:23.988
MATT: You guys don't have to make a performance
check because you've exited before, and you're

01:43:23.988 --> 01:43:28.327
completely visually a different individual, so you
guys pass through without an issue. Caleb, you can

01:43:28.327 --> 01:43:32.044
follow up behind, as you are not currently under
direct guard in the tavern. They do notice you

01:43:32.266 --> 01:43:39.070
exit, and they're aware of your presence, but you
are not confined to the tavern. So you guys all

01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:44.595
manage to slowly come together a few blocks down
and out of the sight of the crownsguard guarding

01:43:44.595 --> 01:43:48.497
the Nestled Nook Inn, and where are you off to?

01:43:48.497 --> 01:43:51.421
LAURA: We did it! Where should we go?

01:43:51.421 --> 01:43:53.491
TRAVIS: Let's just keep walking for now.

01:43:53.491 --> 01:43:58.999
LAURA: Okay. Should we walk toward the carnival
where the zombies were?

01:43:58.999 --> 01:44:02.101
TALIESIN: Who was he, would be my question.

01:44:02.101 --> 01:44:06.968
LAURA: Oh, right. We should find out where he's
from. How do we do that? Should we ask around and

01:44:06.968 --> 01:44:13.138
say hey, anybody know where the old guy came from
that turned into a zombie?

01:44:13.138 --> 01:44:14.840
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:17.529
TALIESIN: Seems to be the most appropriate thing
to ask at this point.

01:44:17.529 --> 01:44:21.284
LIAM: Well, we could find some public places and
just gossip a bit, see if anybody has heard of

01:44:21.518 --> 01:44:25.267
him, if a friend has died at the circus last
night.

01:44:25.267 --> 01:44:30.010
MARISHA: I mean, you mentioned no sick people. If
he was sick, sometimes that word gets around.

01:44:30.010 --> 01:44:33.452
TRAVIS: Maybe there is a morgue, maybe they
recognized him.

01:44:33.452 --> 01:44:37.565
TALIESIN: These small towns, most everyone knows
everybody else.

01:44:37.565 --> 01:44:39.811
LAURA: Let's go to, is there a market area?

01:44:39.811 --> 01:44:45.089
MATT: They don't have a large bazaar, but there is
an area that is generally where a lot of the

01:44:45.267 --> 01:44:56.032
simple wares and vegetables and meats and people
who sell small things that they craft their own

01:44:56.032 --> 01:45:00.394
at, it's a small market. If you want to make an
investigation check.

01:45:05.639 --> 01:45:07.406
LAURA: 16.

01:45:07.406 --> 01:45:14.584
MATT: Okay, by going around asking questions and
inquiring and trying to prod people to talk about

01:45:14.584 --> 01:45:20.784
what transpired the night before, the information
you gather involves the man who passed away. His

01:45:20.784 --> 01:45:23.166
name is Enon Brinjay.

01:45:23.166 --> 01:45:25.529
LIAM: Grimjay?

01:45:25.529 --> 01:45:42.406
MATT: Brinjay. He's a standard human being in his
early 80s. He's old, but healthy, it seemed.

01:45:44.761 --> 01:45:46.555
TRAVIS: Was he in good health?

01:45:46.555 --> 01:45:49.151
MATT: Seemed to be in good health for his age.

01:45:49.151 --> 01:45:52.570
LIAM: So our war against the old continues.

01:45:52.985 --> 01:45:55.028
MATT: Apparently.

01:45:55.261 --> 01:45:59.655
TALIESIN: We're the Logan's Run of D&amp;D.

01:45:59.655 --> 01:46:06.461
MATT: He seemed to have been retired for quite
some time, but had been making little bits here

01:46:06.461 --> 01:46:14.241
and there, helping the fishermen move fish to and
from the outside of the lake. He wasn't really

01:46:14.241 --> 01:46:18.921
well known. The reason people are talking about
him now is because the word is gotten around and

01:46:18.921 --> 01:46:24.788
gossiped about, but for the most part, he was one
of the many faceless people that live in the town.

01:46:24.788 --> 01:46:27.425
A handful knew his name.

01:46:27.425 --> 01:46:29.635
TALIESIN: Retired fisherman?

01:46:29.635 --> 01:46:31.778
MARISHA: He was helping.

01:46:31.778 --> 01:46:35.492
TALIESIN: Do we know where he was retired from and
where he was staying, maybe where he was drinking?

01:46:35.492 --> 01:46:37.667
He had to go somewhere.

01:46:37.667 --> 01:46:44.578
MATT: Actually, he was known often to be drinking
at The Old Mud Hole Tavern.

01:46:47.068 --> 01:46:50.297
TALIESIN: Is that with the weird "e" spelling?

01:46:50.366 --> 01:46:52.302
MATT: No, just "old."

01:46:52.302 --> 01:46:53.182
TALIESIN: I'm always a fan.

01:46:53.182 --> 01:46:54.297
MATT: I know.

01:46:54.297 --> 01:46:55.573
LAURA: "Ye olde."

01:46:55.573 --> 01:47:00.027
TALIESIN: "Ye olde" It's pronounced "the" when you
see the ye.

01:47:00.027 --> 01:47:06.118
TRAVIS: I should point out this is the second
connection to the Ustaloch.

01:47:06.118 --> 01:47:08.274
TALIESIN: The what?

01:47:08.274 --> 01:47:13.823
TRAVIS: Well, before we met up with you two, we
fought off a wicked, sick water snake.

01:47:13.823 --> 01:47:16.589
LAURA: It came up out of the lake for some
reason.

01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:18.752
TALIESIN: Is this a metaphor or is this actually a
real thing?

01:47:18.752 --> 01:47:21.172
LAURA: It really happened. I almost died.

01:47:21.172 --> 01:47:23.603
MARISHA: I punched a snake to death.

01:47:23.603 --> 01:47:25.169
LAURA: She did.

01:47:25.169 --> 01:47:28.362
SAM: There were the snakes in the circus last
night, but it wasn't related to the attack, I

01:47:28.362 --> 01:47:29.060
suppose.

01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:30.903
LAURA: A little different.

01:47:30.903 --> 01:47:32.879
LIAM: How long of a snake are we talking about?

01:47:32.879 --> 01:47:39.580
MARISHA: Oh, it was a giant water snake, then the
little girls were complaining about more and more

01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:43.351
instances of these snakes coming out of the lake.

01:47:43.351 --> 01:47:47.405
SAM: And this fellow who died worked with the
fishermen in the lake?

01:47:47.405 --> 01:47:52.722
LAURA: Well, he took some jobs with them. Did
anybody see him the day of the carnival? Was he

01:47:52.722 --> 01:47:55.088
working with anyone that day?

01:47:55.088 --> 01:47:59.523
MATT: You don't find any of that information. That
would be an intense investigation. You would have

01:47:59.523 --> 01:48:02.864
to go beyond asking questions around a market.

01:48:02.864 --> 01:48:05.720
SAM: Is the lake within the city limits?

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:06.935
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:48:06.935 --> 01:48:09.962
MATT: It's technically considered part of the
city. It might not be an issue.

01:48:09.962 --> 01:48:16.515
LAURA: Where's Ye Olde Mud Hole Tavern at?

01:48:16.515 --> 01:48:20.252
MATT: The Mud Hole Tavern, you've been to before.

01:48:20.252 --> 01:48:21.880
TALIESIN: I was doing my rounds.

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:24.461
MATT: Yeah, when you first entered the city, so
you can--

01:48:24.461 --> 01:48:26.886
MARISHA: The Lochward, is that what we're talking
about?

01:48:26.886 --> 01:48:32.181
MATT: The Lochward is where the Old Mud Hole would
be at. The Lochward is to the eastern side of the

01:48:32.181 --> 01:48:35.246
entire city. The Lochward is the central one.

01:48:35.246 --> 01:48:38.466
LIAM: The wards border the lake.

01:48:38.466 --> 01:48:45.119
MATT: So you make your way to the Old Mud Hole.
Entering inside, this is a dark dive of a bar,

01:48:45.119 --> 01:48:58.101
you've been there once before. It smells heavily
of old, wet wood, ale stains, and peanut. It's a

01:48:58.656 --> 01:49:03.980
very small area and of the four tables that are
there, they are mostly empty, except for one old

01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:09.738
man who is sitting there in the process of playing
a game of solitaire with his cards and a man in

01:49:09.738 --> 01:49:15.539
his 30s thumbing through a book, who would be the
barkeep if there were more patrons at the moment.

01:49:15.539 --> 01:49:21.614
He's flipping through and glances up and gives you
a look as you enter. "Can I help you? Are you

01:49:21.614 --> 01:49:24.320
"looking for drinks? Can I get you anything?"

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.455
LIAM: Yeah, I would really love a drink and I sit
down next to him. What do you have? I need

01:49:27.455 --> 01:49:31.137
something heavier than a trost. I've had enough
trosts to last me a lifetime.

01:49:31.137 --> 01:49:32.699
MATT: "We have liquor."

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:34.806
LIAM: I will take your liquor.

01:49:34.806 --> 01:49:38.232
MATT: "I will get some whiskey for you then.
Whiskey, everyone?"

01:49:38.232 --> 01:49:39.337
MARISHA: Sure.

01:49:39.337 --> 01:49:41.804
SAM: Two please.

01:49:42.954 --> 01:49:51.999
LAURA: It's okay. She's my daughter. She loves
whiskey. I don't even remember what voice I was doing.

01:49:52.174 --> 01:49:54.782
(laughing)

01:49:54.782 --> 01:49:57.263
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:49:58.133 --> 01:50:07.192
LAURA: I let her have any whiskey she wants. Oh,
that's pretty good. 17.

01:50:07.192 --> 01:50:12.393
TALIESIN: We've been doing a pub crawl.

01:50:12.393 --> 01:50:17.747
MATT: He goes and lines up a few small containers,
fills whiskey for all of you. "All right, that

01:50:17.747 --> 01:50:22.749
"will be eight silver for the batch."

01:50:24.818 --> 01:50:30.425
LIAM: I have that. I pull out eight silver. Oh
wait, silver, did you say? I do not have eight

01:50:30.425 --> 01:50:32.162
silver.

01:50:32.162 --> 01:50:34.790
LAURA: It's okay. I have it.

01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:35.942
LIAM: You do?

01:50:35.942 --> 01:50:39.416
LAURA: Sure. 
(high-pitched voice) I mean, sure.

01:50:39.416 --> 01:50:45.748
MATT: He takes the silver and puts it away, slides
the drinks to the rest of you and goes back to his

01:50:45.748 --> 01:50:48.573
book and starts thumbing through again.

01:50:48.573 --> 01:50:57.405
LIAM: Honestly, it's been a terrible 24 hours. We
were at the circus last night and I did not know

01:50:57.491 --> 01:51:02.681
him well, but old man Brinjay fell.

01:51:02.681 --> 01:51:07.844
MATT: He looks up and goes, "Enon, it's sad to see
him go and many of us were wondering what day it

01:51:07.844 --> 01:51:09.145
"was going to be."

01:51:09.145 --> 01:51:11.067
LIAM: Did you know him?

01:51:11.067 --> 01:51:14.259
MATT: "He came in here most every day to drink.
He's a lonely man."

01:51:14.259 --> 01:51:19.374
LIAM: It was a terrible way to go. I'm sorry.

01:51:19.374 --> 01:51:24.073
MATT: "Doesn't bother me one way or the other.
Just sad to lose a patron."

01:51:24.073 --> 01:51:28.660
LAURA: Do you know who was talking to him the day
of the carnival?

01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:35.726
MATT: "I don't recall. Sometimes he would tell
stories to whoever was willing to listen and not

01:51:35.726 --> 01:51:37.506
"most were willing to listen."

01:51:37.506 --> 01:51:39.131
LAURA: Was he here that day?

01:51:39.131 --> 01:51:40.834
MATT: "Yesterday?"

01:51:40.834 --> 01:51:42.623
LAURA: Yeah.

01:51:42.623 --> 01:51:47.926
MATT: "I think he came in briefly for a drink
before the carnival, but that was it."

01:51:47.926 --> 01:51:52.671
MARISHA: You know, we should drink to old stories
of Brinjay.

01:51:52.671 --> 01:51:55.843
TRAVIS: (shushes)

01:51:55.843 --> 01:52:01.293
TALIESIN: I down my shot. What did the man drink
out of curiosity? What was his final drink? I'm a

01:52:01.293 --> 01:52:03.992
bit of a macabre person myself.

01:52:03.992 --> 01:52:06.190
MATT: "It's this very whiskey you just had."

01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:09.390
TALIESIN: I'll take one more, and I'll get one of
my own.

01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:13.062
LIAM: I heard he was sick, too.

01:52:13.062 --> 01:52:24.602
MATT: "I don't believe he was ill. I hope not. He
seemed to be rather wasting away. You shouldn't be

01:52:24.602 --> 01:52:27.228
doing so much manual labor at that age."

01:52:27.228 --> 01:52:29.327
SAM: What labor was he doing?

01:52:29.327 --> 01:52:33.857
MATT: "He carries stuff around from small tasks
to--

01:52:33.857 --> 01:52:35.225
SAM: Down at the docks?

01:52:35.225 --> 01:52:42.572
MATT: "The docks, up at the North Ward. He carried
crates, boxes. Just odd jobs, ways to get by 'til

01:52:42.572 --> 01:52:47.774
"the end of his days, which now that they've come,
may he rest and not have to do odd jobs ever

01:52:47.774 --> 01:52:51.536
"again." He pours his own bit of whiskey.

01:52:51.536 --> 01:52:53.191
ALL: Cheers.

01:52:53.191 --> 01:52:57.336
LAURA: Do you know who he was doing odd jobs for
that day?

01:52:57.336 --> 01:53:00.830
SAM: Your lady voice is worse than mine.

01:53:03.228 --> 01:53:06.798
MATT: "To be honest, if he did, I wasn't paying
attention."

01:53:06.798 --> 01:53:09.295
LIAM: I'm sure his family will miss him very
much.

01:53:09.295 --> 01:53:16.484
MATT: "There's nobody nearby. He had a son about
35 years ago, but he got married and went up

01:53:16.484 --> 01:53:19.353
"north."

01:53:19.353 --> 01:53:24.504
TRAVIS: Did he work for any of the particular
breweries around?

01:53:24.601 --> 01:53:27.157
MATT: "I don't know. Maybe."

01:53:31.268 --> 01:53:33.092
MARISHA: Brinjay.

01:53:38.969 --> 01:53:42.783
LAURA: Where did he sit in here?

01:53:42.783 --> 01:53:46.912
MATT: He points over to the not the table the guy
is playing solitaire on, but the empty table to

01:53:46.912 --> 01:53:51.153
the right of him. "Usually right there in the
corner."

01:53:51.364 --> 01:53:56.162
LAURA: I go sit in the corner. I'm going to look
for anything I can find that looks like an old man was

01:53:56.162 --> 01:53:57.813
touching it.

01:53:57.883 --> 01:53:59.751
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

01:53:59.751 --> 01:54:06.416
LAURA: Okay. I'm really good at these. 12.

01:54:06.728 --> 01:54:16.751
MATT: 12. It looks like probably old person
touching has been all over here. Yes. The table is

01:54:16.751 --> 01:54:23.069
very old and warped in places, stains all over it.
It's not a very good table. It's seen some rough

01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:24.703
days.

01:54:27.187 --> 01:54:31.381
TRAVIS: If we were to go down to the docks and ask
after a few people he worked with, is there anyone

01:54:31.381 --> 01:54:36.122
you know that we should speak to, familiar of
his?

01:54:36.122 --> 01:54:40.269
MATT: "I apologize. I served him drinks and
pretended to listen to him many times, but I

01:54:40.269 --> 01:54:42.041
"wasn't really paying attention."

01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:44.570
TRAVIS: I understand that.

01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:48.904
MARISHA: Is there anyone who did? That wasn't
hypothetical.

01:54:50.525 --> 01:55:00.005
MATT: "Maybe. I apologize. I spend most of my days
reading." He lifts the book.

01:55:00.005 --> 01:55:02.618
MARISHA: What's the book?

01:55:02.618 --> 01:55:04.466
SAM: You read!

01:55:04.466 --> 01:55:07.076
LIAM: Subtle, guys.

01:55:07.076 --> 01:55:12.131
TALIESIN: We got a reader. While they're doing
this, I'm going to saunter over to the card

01:55:12.131 --> 01:55:13.633
player.

01:55:13.633 --> 01:55:17.441
LIAM: Can I see what's on the spine of that book
from where I am?

01:55:17.441 --> 01:55:29.536
MATT: At a glance at it, it's in Zemnian, which
you can read. The translation would come about to

01:55:29.536 --> 01:55:33.067
The Rosed Embrace.

01:55:33.067 --> 01:55:35.342
MARISHA: A romance novel.

01:55:35.342 --> 01:55:36.710
MATT: Probably.

01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:39.685
LAURA: Is Fabio on the cover?

01:55:39.685 --> 01:55:45.547
LIAM: How's your trashy novel? Is it a good one? No
judgement.

01:55:45.646 --> 01:55:49.331
MATT: "It's not trashy. It's very tasteful."

01:55:50.998 --> 01:55:54.567
LIAM: Oh no, I'm fluent in Zemnian. I've read all
of his works.

01:55:54.567 --> 01:55:55.736
MATT: "Have you?"

01:55:55.736 --> 01:55:58.093
LIAM: Mutual fan.

01:55:58.093 --> 01:56:02.457
MATT: "I didn't realize there was another Samuel
fan in here. Which is your favorite?"

01:56:02.457 --> 01:56:04.796
LIAM: I love the Farthing's Embrace.

01:56:04.796 --> 01:56:07.101
MATT: "I haven't read that one."

01:56:07.101 --> 01:56:11.626
LIAM: It's an early one. He actually did it under
a pseudonym. He did a whole series under that

01:56:11.626 --> 01:56:13.344
pseudonym, short stories.

01:56:13.344 --> 01:56:18.503
MATT: "What is it again?" He goes over and grabs a
piece of chalk in the back and starts, "It was--?"

01:56:18.503 --> 01:56:21.664
LIAM: Farthing's Embrace.

01:56:21.785 --> 01:56:30.785
MATT: "Mein Gott, I did not know about this. I may
have to send out Zadash and see if we can find

01:56:30.785 --> 01:56:32.693
"some of those books. Thank you."

01:56:32.693 --> 01:56:35.159
LIAM: You're a big reader or just Samuel?

01:56:35.159 --> 01:56:39.601
MATT: "Just recently Samuel. I read on occasion.
It depends on what you can find."

01:56:39.601 --> 01:56:45.755
LIAM: I read a lot, but all I've been able to find
in this town is that parchment place.

01:56:45.755 --> 01:56:48.872
MATT: "The parchment place is good for trash. If
you're looking for unique stuff, there's a few

01:56:48.872 --> 01:56:50.276
"places you can go."

01:56:50.276 --> 01:56:51.713
LIAM: Here in town?

01:56:51.713 --> 01:56:57.612
MATT: "Here in town, yeah. If you're having a hard
time finding a specific book, I would recommend

01:56:57.612 --> 01:57:00.211
"going to Burnished Bibelots."

01:57:00.211 --> 01:57:02.452
LIAM: Burnished Bibelots. Which ward is that in?

01:57:02.452 --> 01:57:07.397
MATT: "That is in the North Ward, just on the
outskirts of the main market street. It's a bit of

01:57:07.397 --> 01:57:11.203
"a cluttered mess, but Oglen would be happy to help
you.

01:57:11.203 --> 01:57:12.884
LIAM: Oglen?

01:57:12.884 --> 01:57:15.457
MATT: "Oglen."

01:57:15.457 --> 01:57:19.160
LIAM: That is good to know. Thank you.

01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:21.785
MATT: "Not to worry."

01:57:21.785 --> 01:57:26.816
LIAM: Those are hard to find, the Farthing's
Embrace.

01:57:26.816 --> 01:57:30.784
MATT: "I imagine so. It can't be that bad."

01:57:30.784 --> 01:57:33.767
LIAM: He wasn't as proud of them. Early work and
all that.

01:57:33.767 --> 01:57:37.875
MATT: "Of course. I have a contact in Rexxentrum.
If I cannot find it in Zadash, I will get it from Rexxentrum."

01:57:38.246 --> 01:57:40.262
LIAM: That would be the place.

01:57:40.262 --> 01:57:41.893
MATT: "What's your name?"

01:57:41.893 --> 01:57:43.321
LIAM: My name is Caleb.

01:57:43.321 --> 01:57:46.318
MATT: "Caleb. Pleasure to meet you. I am Vosna."

01:57:46.318 --> 01:57:52.867
TRAVIS: Thank you for the drink, Vosna. I'll be
taking my leave now.

01:57:52.867 --> 01:57:59.768
MATT: "Of course. If anybody else is a reader as
well, come by and talk sometime."

01:58:00.816 --> 01:58:03.400
TALIESIN: Not there at all.

01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:06.555
LIAM: This has been quite a day.

01:58:06.555 --> 01:58:10.890
LAURA: Is there pictures?
(in high-pitched voice) Is there pictures?

01:58:13.857 --> 01:58:16.810
MATT: "Pictures are up in here."

01:58:17.103 --> 01:58:23.311
LAURA: Oh. Sounds exciting.

01:58:27.851 --> 01:58:31.281
LIAM: I sneak my undrunk whiskey to Nott.

01:58:31.610 --> 01:58:36.353
SAM: I take out my flask from my leg, unscrew it,
and pour it in.

01:58:36.353 --> 01:58:39.182
MATT: Okay.

01:58:40.748 --> 01:58:46.052
LAURA: What do you guys think? Should we stay
here? Should we go somewhere else?

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:48.964
TRAVIS: We got to get Molly.

01:58:48.964 --> 01:58:50.983
TALIESIN: I just sat down for a moment with this
solitaire player.

01:58:50.983 --> 01:58:53.604
MATT: Correct.

01:58:55.641 --> 01:58:59.805
TALIESIN: They say that solitaire is the game for
the death-obsessed. There's inevitability to every

01:58:59.805 --> 01:59:07.666
hand, most of them are doomed from the start no
matter what you do. Any interest to buck fate and

01:59:07.666 --> 01:59:12.484
try your hand at an opponent for once? No money,
just friendly.

01:59:19.834 --> 01:59:22.807
I slide the rest of my whiskey over.

01:59:22.807 --> 01:59:25.005
MATT: "Are you a devil?"

01:59:25.005 --> 01:59:27.118
TALIESIN: I've been called worse.

01:59:27.118 --> 01:59:29.829
MATT: "I don't play with devils."

01:59:29.829 --> 01:59:35.599
TALIESIN: I'm just a man who saw another man die
yesterday. It's been heavy on my conscience and I

01:59:35.599 --> 01:59:39.267
was just wondering if there was anything you could
tell me about Enon.

01:59:39.267 --> 01:59:43.676
MATT: "Enon wanted to go to that bloody circus."

01:59:43.676 --> 01:59:46.175
TALIESIN: I'm regretting it myself.

01:59:46.175 --> 01:59:53.514
MATT: "I told him not to go. Stupid, it is for the
common folk and the young. He's always had his

01:59:53.514 --> 01:59:55.406
"head in the clouds."

01:59:55.406 --> 01:59:58.039
TALIESIN: Has he? That's not what other people
have said.

01:59:58.039 --> 02:00:02.309
MATT: "Other people are stupid."

02:00:02.309 --> 02:00:06.381
TALIESIN: Why do you think he went? Why do you
think that happened to him?

02:00:06.381 --> 02:00:15.322
MATT: "He's lonely. Don't trust the carnival.
Nothing but spooks and magicians and things that

02:00:15.322 --> 02:00:24.831
"want to take your life and take your money, take
your family, whisk you away. Fuck the circus."

02:00:24.831 --> 02:00:35.484
TALIESIN: Fuck the circus. So that's what you
think happened to him, then? I feel like there's

02:00:35.484 --> 02:00:38.983
something evil afoot.

02:00:38.983 --> 02:00:41.805
MATT: "Says the devil."

02:00:41.805 --> 02:00:44.751
TALIESIN: Again, I've been called worse. Sure you
have in your time, as well.

02:00:46.111 --> 02:00:50.690
MATT: He takes the drink, sips it. "Don't come
'round here no more."

02:00:54.626 --> 02:01:01.093
TALIESIN: I take my cup back. Down it. I love
small towns.

02:01:02.414 --> 02:01:04.152
MARISHA: Shithead.

02:01:04.620 --> 02:01:10.053
TRAVIS: We head outside. Well, that was
revealing.

02:01:11.096 --> 02:01:12.487
SAM: Was it?

02:01:12.487 --> 02:01:20.908
MARISHA: We learned a few things, actually. He's a
prime target. Perfect victim, perfect candidate.

02:01:20.908 --> 02:01:26.899
No one really paid attention to him, he was old,
he had no family, his son's gone.

02:01:26.899 --> 02:01:28.207
TALIESIN: Awfully convenient.

02:01:28.207 --> 02:01:34.385
MARISHA: Awfully convenient. Still awfully
convenient that your little circus doesn't allow

02:01:34.385 --> 02:01:39.462
the elderly, which you never fully explained, and
he happened to be one of the oldest people in that

02:01:39.462 --> 02:01:46.594
circus. Where did that rule come from?
The sick makes sense, I asked you that

02:01:46.594 --> 02:01:50.139
before, but why elderly?

02:01:50.139 --> 02:01:53.490
TALIESIN: That rule's been around for as long as I
can remember because it makes people think the

02:01:53.490 --> 02:01:58.875
show's dangerous. Gives them a thrill.

02:01:58.875 --> 02:02:01.728
TRAVIS: You're worried about them having a heart
attack or something?

02:02:01.728 --> 02:02:04.289
TALIESIN: We're not really worried about people
having a heart attack; we want people to be

02:02:04.289 --> 02:02:08.761
worried about having a heart attack, because then
they're more excited to come see the show. This is

02:02:08.761 --> 02:02:10.206
how these shows work.

02:02:10.206 --> 02:02:12.397
MARISHA: Do you know who implemented that rule?

02:02:12.397 --> 02:02:14.691
TALIESIN: Before my time.

02:02:14.691 --> 02:02:20.878
LAURA: In his defense, every carnival I've gone to
has said no sick people, no old people.

02:02:20.878 --> 02:02:24.094
TALIESIN: It's a boilerplate.

02:02:24.094 --> 02:02:27.069
MARISHA: Still a good candidate.

02:02:27.069 --> 02:02:30.908
TALIESIN: If you were trying to hide doing
something to someone it's a great candidate. If I

02:02:30.908 --> 02:02:34.448
was trying to get away with something, terrible
idea.

02:02:34.448 --> 02:02:41.031
MARISHA: Or if you were trying to frame someone.
Seems to be a lot of pretty bigoted people in this

02:02:41.031 --> 02:02:47.490
town who don't like tieflings and other strange
lots. Jester, you actually said one of the

02:02:47.490 --> 02:02:57.500
smartest things of the night, which is-- you did,
yeah. Which is, guard's really weird.

02:02:57.500 --> 02:02:58.537
LAURA: Right?

02:02:58.537 --> 02:02:59.773
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:02:59.773 --> 02:03:00.980
TALIESIN: Wait, what?

02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:02.506
LAURA: The guards are really weird.

02:03:02.506 --> 02:03:06.066
MARISHA: The Crownsguards. As you were saying, the
Ustaloch?

02:03:06.066 --> 02:03:07.493
TALIESIN: What kind of weird?

02:03:07.493 --> 02:03:11.519
LAURA: Like, you know, they-- What kind of weird?

02:03:11.519 --> 02:03:14.266
(laughter)

02:03:14.266 --> 02:03:26.494
MARISHA: They seem to be the one connecting
through-line. Also, what's her name, Norda?

02:03:26.494 --> 02:03:35.767
Mentioned that she didn't want to let you lot in,
but made an exception. I don't know, if I wanted

02:03:35.767 --> 02:03:42.100
to do something, and if I already knew a bunch of
people were upset and angry at a circus and

02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:49.213
strange people coming in, it's easy framing, in my
opinion.

02:03:49.213 --> 02:03:51.504
TRAVIS: She makes a valid point, actually.

02:03:51.504 --> 02:03:57.420
LAURA. Oh. If people are scared of carnivals, they
won't want them in the future.

02:03:57.420 --> 02:03:59.554
TRAVIS: Bingo.

02:03:59.554 --> 02:04:05.134
MARISHA: That, or if you're up to no good and you
don't want to get caught, blame it on the easy

02:04:05.134 --> 02:04:08.737
frame. The weirdos who just rolled into town.

02:04:08.737 --> 02:04:13.501
LAURA: Great, so we just need to investigate the
guards.

02:04:13.501 --> 02:04:16.537
TRAVIS: That might be harder to do. Maybe we go
down to the Lochward.

02:04:16.537 --> 02:04:18.541
TALIESIN: Start at the docks, but I'll keep that
in mind.

02:04:18.541 --> 02:04:20.945
MARISHA: I don't know, it might not be the
guards. There might be another through-line

02:04:20.945 --> 02:04:22.287
that we're missing.

02:04:22.287 --> 02:04:25.369
LAURA: Do we need to question the guards?

02:04:25.369 --> 02:04:26.760
SAM: That sounds terrible.

02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:29.039
LAURA: Maybe we should tell them they can't leave
town.

02:04:29.039 --> 02:04:33.380
MARISHA: Ooh, that's a good idea, yeah! Maybe when
they question us--

02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:34.690
LAURA: We turn it around!

02:04:34.690 --> 02:04:36.162
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah!

02:04:36.162 --> 02:04:37.435
MARISHA: I like that.

02:04:37.435 --> 02:04:39.270
TALIESIN: I was about-- nope, nevermind.

02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:40.480
LAURA: What?

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.779
TALIESIN: I was about to be very impressed, but I
take it back.

02:04:42.779 --> 02:04:44.688
MARISHA: Aw.

02:04:47.083 --> 02:04:49.671
TRAVIS: How far is it from where we are to the
Lochward?

02:04:49.671 --> 02:04:55.523
MATT: You guys are technically in the Lochward.
It's a quick jaunt over to the edge of the Ustaloch.

02:04:55.523 --> 02:05:01.046
MARISHA: So the Ustaloch is the docks? It's what
they called the ward, or it's the lake?

02:05:01.046 --> 02:05:04.039
MATT: It's the giant lake that the docks are up
against. The city is built against this giant,

02:05:04.039 --> 02:05:05.713
kidney bean-shaped lake.

02:05:05.713 --> 02:05:08.772
MARISHA: What does "usta" mean? What does "usta"
come from?

02:05:08.772 --> 02:05:11.012
MATT: Do you speak Zemnian?

02:05:11.012 --> 02:05:12.753
MARISHA: You speak Zemnian.

02:05:12.753 --> 02:05:14.066
LIAM: I do speak Zemnian.

02:05:14.066 --> 02:05:15.329
TALIESIN: What does "usta" mean?

02:05:15.329 --> 02:05:17.026
LIAM: It means--

02:05:17.026 --> 02:05:18.020
MATT: Do you know?

02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:19.171
LIAM: Do I know?

02:05:19.171 --> 02:05:21.170
MATT: I just wanted to fuck with you.

02:05:21.170 --> 02:05:26.979
LIAM: It's been a while, but osten means lake. No,
it's not Lake Lake.

02:05:26.979 --> 02:05:28.785
MATT: Essentially, it just means "an east lake."

02:05:28.785 --> 02:05:31.160
LIAM and MARISHA: East Lake.

02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:33.059
TALIESIN: Very good.

02:05:33.059 --> 02:05:35.830
MATT: Not too complicated.

02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:37.518
MARISHA: All right.

02:05:37.518 --> 02:05:41.150
TALIESIN: I'd like to avoid the guards for as long
as possible.

02:05:41.150 --> 02:05:42.161
MARISHA: Agreed.

02:05:42.161 --> 02:05:48.291
TRAVIS: Let's head down to the docks. Keeping an
eye out for crownsguard.

02:05:48.291 --> 02:05:53.935
MATT: As you guys make your way towards the
Ustaloch and the Dockward there, we'll go and take

02:05:53.935 --> 02:05:58.521
a break. We'll be back in a few minutes. We'll
continue to unveil this mystery.

02:05:58.521 --> 02:06:01.514
SAM: This is exciting. Gripping.

02:06:01.514 --> 02:06:10.107
MATT: Indeed. I suppose. Little low level mystery
here. We'll see where this goes. All right guys,

02:06:10.107 --> 02:06:13.929
back here in a few minutes. We're going to take a
quick restroom break, pick it up from here. We

02:06:13.929 --> 02:06:18.692
have video at the break for this week's contest,
so if you're watching on Twitch, feel free to go

02:06:18.692 --> 02:06:23.112
ahead and pay attention to get the password and
enter this contest, and we'll have the victor at

02:06:23.112 --> 02:06:28.138
the end of the break. We'll be back here in a few
minutes, and we'll see you then.

02:06:28.138 --> 02:20:41.677
[break]

02:20:41.677 --> 02:20:47.482
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Before we dive in,
real fast, we do have a winner from the chat.

02:20:47.482 --> 02:20:54.676
Thanks, Sam. Congratulations to AvilynRain,
AvilynRain in the Twitch chat! You won the awesome

02:20:54.676 --> 02:20:59.331
Wyrmwood prize package. Danoba will be in contact
with you to get your contact information and get

02:20:59.331 --> 02:21:02.563
that sent out to you. Congratulations.

02:21:02.677 --> 02:21:07.322
MARISHA: I love how we just went through every
rain song in about 30 seconds.

02:21:07.322 --> 02:21:14.667
MATT: Yeah we did! Most of them. As you guys make
your way across the streets of the Lochward, you

02:21:14.667 --> 02:21:22.448
find yourself to the docks, which are about five
or six main dock structures that protrude anywhere

02:21:22.448 --> 02:21:29.960
from ten to 30 or so feet into the loch itself.
There are no major ships. The biggest river that

02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:33.851
exits the loch heads towards the mountains, so
there is no direct path to the inlet. All the

02:21:33.851 --> 02:21:38.146
boats in here are small fishermen's boats; they're
designed specifically for the lake, for freshwater

02:21:38.146 --> 02:21:45.461
fishing and whatever needs to be transferred from
bank to bank. As you approach, you can see a good

02:21:45.461 --> 02:21:49.610
amount of the boats are still out on the water.
You can look out and see the outline of them

02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:56.259
against the horizon. You see a couple of small
landmasses in the center of the loch, that are

02:21:56.259 --> 02:22:04.963
barely out of view. You approach, and the first
couple of fishermen that walk past you both look

02:22:04.963 --> 02:22:14.199
to be hardened in their years. Their skin is very
battered by the sun, it's wrinkled and dark from

02:22:14.199 --> 02:22:20.620
constant beating of the sky upon them. They glance
over at this unique-looking troupe as they

02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:25.112
approach. They stop and don't say anything, they
just look at you like "What are you doing here?"

02:22:25.112 --> 02:22:26.905
LAURA: Do we still have Disguise Self up?

02:22:26.905 --> 02:22:30.718
MATT: You have it for maybe ten more minutes.

02:22:30.718 --> 02:22:32.680
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:22:34.019 --> 02:22:37.637
TRAVIS: Do we see any King's Guard? Crownsguard?

02:22:37.637 --> 02:22:40.268
MATT: Crownsguard? Make a perception check.

02:22:47.812 --> 02:22:49.811
LAURA: 11.

02:22:49.811 --> 02:22:52.177
TRAVIS: 11, same.

02:22:52.177 --> 02:22:55.388
MATT: Glancing about, you don't see any
crownsguard in the immediate vicinity of the

02:22:55.388 --> 02:23:00.606
Lochward. You've seen them, they patrol the town
and walk through, ward to ward, but you don't see

02:23:00.606 --> 02:23:02.524
any at the moment, no.

02:23:03.577 --> 02:23:08.049
LAURA: Looks like we're ahead of them in the
investigation.

02:23:08.049 --> 02:23:17.138
MARISHA: Hey, Jester. Do you happen to remember
the name of that guy whose daughter we saved from

02:23:17.138 --> 02:23:18.585
the snake?

02:23:18.585 --> 02:23:20.598
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:23:20.598 --> 02:23:22.993
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:23:22.993 --> 02:23:25.921
LAURA: Let's see if I wrote it down in my
sketchbook.

02:23:25.921 --> 02:23:28.830
MARISHA: Yeah, because I didn't write it down.

02:23:28.830 --> 02:23:30.376
LAURA: King Bertrand?

02:23:30.376 --> 02:23:32.126
TRAVIS: No.

02:23:32.126 --> 02:23:46.829
LAURA: Okay. What about-- no, I know that guy.
Nope, I didn't.

02:23:47.180 --> 02:23:48.307
MARISHA: Damn it.

02:23:48.307 --> 02:23:50.473
MATT: You remember where he lives, mostly, because
you were there.

02:23:50.473 --> 02:23:52.064
MARISHA: That's true.

02:23:52.064 --> 02:23:53.517
LAURA: We could go by there.

02:23:53.517 --> 02:23:56.351
MARISHA: We could go by. He seems to like us.

02:23:56.351 --> 02:23:59.061
LAURA: He worked out there, right?

02:23:59.061 --> 02:24:00.811
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

02:24:00.811 --> 02:24:08.225
MATT: You guys make your way along the edge of the
loch to the outside of the fisherman's house. The

02:24:08.225 --> 02:24:15.224
house is currently being repaired. You can see in
the main doorway, the door is off the hinges, and

02:24:15.224 --> 02:24:19.770
there's a large pile of ruined furniture and
cabinets that have been shifted out of the

02:24:19.770 --> 02:24:30.549
building. You can also see a &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; serpentine
body that is currently being skinned by a younger

02:24:30.549 --> 02:24:35.525
man, probably 14 or 15. He's in the process of
carving the skin off of it. This thing is about 20

02:24:35.525 --> 02:24:37.809
to 25 feet long.

02:24:37.809 --> 02:24:39.469
MARISHA: That's the snake I punched.

02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:42.860
LIAM: That's your work? That's impressive. You
took it all by yourself?

02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:48.284
MARISHA: Well, no. They helped me. I'm not an
egomaniac. They fucking helped me.

02:24:48.284 --> 02:24:51.795
LIAM: But I saw your guns last night. You probably
took the lead.

02:24:54.265 --> 02:24:58.681
MARISHA: Give credit to the whole damn group, move
on.

02:25:02.604 --> 02:25:06.028
TRAVIS: Flattery got you nowhere.

02:25:06.028 --> 02:25:10.254
TALIESIN: I'm comparing the snake to the snake
that's tattooed on my hand to try and get the

02:25:10.254 --> 02:25:13.838
heads to be the exact same size.

02:25:13.838 --> 02:25:18.187
LIAM: We have been in the woods for too long. I've
forgotten how to talk to people.

02:25:18.187 --> 02:25:21.534
SAM: Your game is really suffering.

02:25:21.534 --> 02:25:24.608
MARISHA: Thanks for the damn compliment.

02:25:24.608 --> 02:25:31.204
MATT: As you approach, the young man with this
large, sharpened knife-- it looks like it may have

02:25:31.204 --> 02:25:36.870
been a heavy butchering knife that he's using to
fillet and pull the skin off the snake. Looks back

02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:42.832
at you guys and doesn't know what's going on. You
hear a voice go, "Hey!" You look up and you see

02:25:42.832 --> 02:25:45.734
the fisherman that you saw before, the one who
came to you guys in the tavern. He's up on top of

02:25:45.734 --> 02:25:49.474
the roof, and he's currently boarding some
portions of it. It looks like a part of the roof

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:56.282
had been damaged in the fray. He goes, "Hold on,"
gets up, and comes down the ladder on the side and

02:25:56.282 --> 02:26:02.153
approaches. You can see he's sweating. "I'm so
sorry, I didn't know you were coming. What can I

02:26:02.153 --> 02:26:03.416
"do for you?"

02:26:03.416 --> 02:26:05.647
MARISHA: Sorry for dropping in.

02:26:05.647 --> 02:26:07.720
LAURA: Do we look like ourselves yet?

02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:12.412
MATT: No, actually. This is an interesting point.

02:26:12.412 --> 02:26:14.382
TRAVIS: Damn it.

02:26:14.382 --> 02:26:16.288
SAM: Wait. None of you look the same.

02:26:16.288 --> 02:26:20.239
MATT: That's right, no, thank you for reminding
me. He comes out and he goes, "How can I help

02:26:20.239 --> 02:26:21.184
"you?"

02:26:21.184 --> 02:26:23.876
(laughter)

02:26:23.876 --> 02:26:26.318
LAURA: It's us!

02:26:26.318 --> 02:26:35.635
MARISHA: Yeah, it's me. I pull the hat off and
pull my hair up. It's Beauregard. We killed your

02:26:35.635 --> 02:26:37.797
snake?

02:26:39.457 --> 02:26:43.650
LAURA: (in normal voice) Pretend that I don't
talk-- (in human accent) Pretend that I don't talk

02:26:43.650 --> 02:26:44.546
like this.

02:26:44.546 --> 02:26:47.438
TRAVIS: Fuck it, I drop Disguise Self.

02:26:47.438 --> 02:26:49.077
MATT: He goes,"Ah!"

02:26:49.333 --> 02:26:52.220
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to deceive you.

02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:54.397
MATT: I'm very confused.

02:26:54.397 --> 02:26:59.752
MARISHA: Oh no. Don't worry about it. What was
your name, friend?

02:26:59.752 --> 02:27:00.768
MATT: "Rinaldo."

02:27:00.768 --> 02:27:06.186
MARISHA: Rinaldo! That's what it was. I knew it
was an R! Okay, Rinaldo.

02:27:06.186 --> 02:27:09.743
TRAVIS: Rinaldo, this snake that was in your house
is not the only strange occurrence that's been

02:27:09.743 --> 02:27:13.642
happening. We're trying to find out the cause of
it. Have you seen anything else like this in the

02:27:13.642 --> 02:27:16.736
time that's passed?

02:27:16.736 --> 02:27:20.270
MATT: "No, we've been doing repairs on the house
and getting everything underway. This is the first

02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:26.376
"thing that's come on this side. Most of them live
toward the center of the lake and stay underwater.

02:27:26.376 --> 02:27:30.649
"It's been two in the last few months that have
come up. It's a bit of a nuisance."

02:27:30.649 --> 02:27:33.603
LAURA: Have you seen any zombies coming out of the
lake?

02:27:33.603 --> 02:27:36.772
MATT: "Zombies? What are you talking about?"

02:27:36.772 --> 02:27:41.397
TRAVIS: We're asking after a man that helped down
at the docks, named Enon. Have you heard of him?

02:27:41.397 --> 02:27:42.558
MATT: "Enon?"

02:27:42.558 --> 02:27:43.747
TRAVIS: Enon.

02:27:43.747 --> 02:27:48.922
MATT: "Yeah, I worked with him a couple times. He
comes through, looking for work, asking to see

02:27:48.922 --> 02:27:50.115
what's available."

02:27:50.115 --> 02:27:57.201
LIAM: You obviously have not heard the news from
the traveling circus in town. From last night.

02:27:57.201 --> 02:27:59.185
MATT: "No. That's the big blue tent, right?"

02:27:59.185 --> 02:28:00.355
LIAM: That's correct.

02:28:00.355 --> 02:28:01.978
MATT: "No, what's going on?"

02:28:01.978 --> 02:28:03.918
LAURA: (whispering) Enon turned into a zombie.

02:28:03.918 --> 02:28:04.968
SAM: What?

02:28:04.968 --> 02:28:08.916
LAURA: (louder) Enon turned into a zombie!
(whispering) And was killed.

02:28:08.916 --> 02:28:11.459
SAM: What?

02:28:11.459 --> 02:28:20.127
MATT: "I'm sorry to hear that. That's terrible.
Wow, that's really terrible. I'm sorry."

02:28:20.127 --> 02:28:23.467
TRAVIS: We were trying to see if he might have
worked with people that might have known what he

02:28:23.467 --> 02:28:26.075
was doing that day, earlier.

02:28:26.075 --> 02:28:29.112
MATT: "I haven't seen him at the docks in a while.
Not for a week, at least."

02:28:29.112 --> 02:28:30.603
TRAVIS and LAURA: Really?

02:28:30.603 --> 02:28:36.409
LIAM: Is there anything out of the ordinary from
the past week or two that comes to mind? Anything

02:28:36.409 --> 02:28:38.979
off about the run-of-the-mill stuff?

02:28:38.979 --> 02:28:47.793
MATT: "Other than a giant fucking snake ruining my
house, but not that comes to mind, no. Circus

02:28:47.793 --> 02:28:51.053
"coming into town, that's a little weird."

02:28:51.053 --> 02:28:54.577
TRAVIS: I see you're skinning the beast. Can I ask
why?

02:28:54.577 --> 02:28:59.210
MATT: "I'm not going to let it go to waste. That's
some good meat. Some good skin."

02:28:59.210 --> 02:29:04.731
MARISHA: You mentioned the circus coming to town
as weird. Why?

02:29:04.731 --> 02:29:08.144
MATT: "Because there's a circus in town."

02:29:08.144 --> 02:29:10.117
LIAM: He just means out of the ordinary, yeah?

02:29:10.117 --> 02:29:15.822
MATT: "Yeah. We don't get many shows and traveling
folk. Last time this was here, a year ago, it came

02:29:15.822 --> 02:29:18.760
"and went in a week."

02:29:19.181 --> 02:29:25.531
SAM: You said you hadn't seen this-- hi. You said
you hadn't seen this person in a week? Was that

02:29:25.531 --> 02:29:27.662
unusual?

02:29:27.662 --> 02:29:33.508
MATT: "No. I didn't keep up with him. He came
through every now and then. I had a little cash

02:29:33.508 --> 02:29:39.256
"and needed some help hauling things around. I
asked for his assistance. He was an old fella, and

02:29:39.256 --> 02:29:45.504
"it was less that he was helpful and more that we
wanted to help when we could."

02:29:45.953 --> 02:29:49.424
TRAVIS: If we went down to the docks where he
worked, is there anyone that we should ask for, to

02:29:49.424 --> 02:29:52.493
speak to, who might have known him better?

02:29:52.493 --> 02:29:57.516
MATT: "Your guess is as good as mine. To be fair,
although we're a community, we're also relatively

02:29:57.516 --> 02:30:01.714
"competitive. You understand."

02:30:02.097 --> 02:30:04.002
TRAVIS: I do.

02:30:04.002 --> 02:30:07.946
TALIESIN: You think anyone would have wanted him
marked or harmed in some way?

02:30:07.946 --> 02:30:16.660
MATT: "I don't think so. He's an old man. I
haven't seen or heard anyone-- his disposition

02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:21.903
"seemed positive enough, if a little sad and
lonely."

02:30:24.486 --> 02:30:28.769
TRAVIS: If you think of anything, or if you hear
anyone speak about him, you can find us at the

02:30:28.949 --> 02:30:33.437
Nestled Nook Inn. We'd appreciate anything, if it
happens to reach your ears.

02:30:33.437 --> 02:30:38.540
MATT: "Of course. Let me finish up here with the
roof and I'll ask around, see if anything comes up."

02:30:38.598 --> 02:30:40.117
TRAVIS: Much obliged.

02:30:40.117 --> 02:30:48.514
MARISHA: How's your little girl doing? Sorry, I
cover my beard.

02:30:48.514 --> 02:30:50.833
MATT: "It just wasn't expected."

02:30:50.833 --> 02:30:52.177
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:30:52.177 --> 02:30:57.818
MATT: "No, she's doing great. She's been a little
spooked, but she slept well last night. She's

02:30:57.818 --> 02:31:03.890
"doing fine. Thank you again for what you guys did
for me."

02:31:03.890 --> 02:31:06.503
LAURA: You're welcome.

02:31:06.503 --> 02:31:11.033
SAM: What? For what?

02:31:11.033 --> 02:31:12.660
LAURA: We saved a little girl!

02:31:12.660 --> 02:31:14.539
SAM: Oh yes, that's right.

02:31:14.539 --> 02:31:19.790
LAURA: If you see any zombies, please let us
know.

02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:23.636
MATT: "I will. You were so kind to help me when I
saw a snake, I figure if I see a zombie, you'd

02:31:23.636 --> 02:31:24.875
"also be helpful."

02:31:24.875 --> 02:31:29.704
LAURA: We would, definitely. We already killed a
zombie too!

02:31:29.704 --> 02:31:33.557
TALIESIN: This is just a snake. This is a big,
weird snake I'm looking at?

02:31:33.557 --> 02:31:35.400
MATT: You can inspect it if you want.

02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:37.138
TALIESIN: No, I've been looking at the snake this
entire time.

02:31:37.138 --> 02:31:39.871
LAURA: Oh, we have one of its fangs. I pulled it
out.

02:31:39.871 --> 02:31:41.937
MATT: Make a nature check.

02:31:41.937 --> 02:31:43.923
SAM: Ooh, don't do those much either.

02:31:43.923 --> 02:31:45.997
MARISHA: I have a fang too, right?

02:31:48.220 --> 02:31:49.880
TALIESIN: Nine.

02:31:49.880 --> 02:31:53.968
MATT: Nine? You don't know much about snake
biology. It's hard to tell if it's out of the

02:31:53.968 --> 02:31:56.693
ordinary. It's just a big snake.

02:31:56.693 --> 02:31:58.169
TALIESIN: Looks like mine.

02:31:58.169 --> 02:31:59.055
LAURA: Only bigger.

02:31:59.055 --> 02:32:01.542
TALIESIN: Much bigger.

02:32:01.542 --> 02:32:03.140
TRAVIS: Shall we?

02:32:03.140 --> 02:32:04.848
LAURA: Fuck. Sure.

02:32:04.848 --> 02:32:07.408
SAM: We are the best detectives ever.

02:32:08.956 --> 02:32:11.932
LAURA: I feel like we are really doing bad at this
detective thing.

02:32:11.932 --> 02:32:15.166
TRAVIS: We should probably wrap up whatever we're
doing. I imagine they're going to come by the inn

02:32:15.166 --> 02:32:18.054
soon and try and speak with us. Not you two.

02:32:18.054 --> 02:32:21.239
SAM: We didn't leave any sort of Ferris Bueller-y
thing?

02:32:21.239 --> 02:32:27.022
TRAVIS: Nope. No stuffed beds, no recordings on
the old VHS.

02:32:29.465 --> 02:32:31.771
MATT: What are you guys doing? Where are you
going?

02:32:31.771 --> 02:32:36.095
SAM: Is there anywhere else that we need to
inspect? The carnival or more docks stuff?

02:32:36.095 --> 02:32:39.249
LAURA: I feel like going back to the carnival is
probably a bad idea.

02:32:39.249 --> 02:32:42.446
TALIESIN: I'd say the docks are his home, if we
could figure out where he lived.

02:32:42.446 --> 02:32:44.341
SAM: Where he was last seen.

02:32:44.341 --> 02:32:46.341
TALIESIN: He was last seen at the circus!

02:32:46.341 --> 02:32:48.385
LAURA: Rinaldo!

02:32:48.385 --> 02:32:49.669
MATT: "Yeah?"

02:32:49.669 --> 02:32:54.265
LAURA: Do you know where Enon lives?

02:32:54.265 --> 02:33:01.683
MATT: "I can't say I do. I'm sorry. My apologies.
Wish I could be of more help."

02:33:01.683 --> 02:33:04.368
LAURA: It's okay.

02:33:04.368 --> 02:33:07.761
TALIESIN: You don't happen to know what happened
to his son, by any chance?

02:33:07.761 --> 02:33:10.809
MATT: "I didn't even know he had a son."

02:33:10.809 --> 02:33:13.397
LAURA: See? We're better investigators than this
guy.

02:33:13.397 --> 02:33:18.164
SAM: But he's not trying to investigate!

02:33:18.164 --> 02:33:21.208
TALIESIN: I take the compliment. I'm putting it my
pocket. I'm keeping it for later.

02:33:21.208 --> 02:33:23.313
MATT: He climbs back up the ladder to the roof.

02:33:23.313 --> 02:33:26.951
MARISHA: I'm starting to think that following
Enon's story isn't necessarily going to lead us

02:33:26.951 --> 02:33:31.249
here. He seems like a random victim.

02:33:31.249 --> 02:33:34.411
LAURA: Hey, 14 year old kid!

02:33:34.411 --> 02:33:41.973
MATT: He has this puffy red 'fro going on. He
looks pale, fresh to this, scrawny. He's stopped

02:33:41.973 --> 02:33:46.612
drawing his blade across the snake. "Yeah?"

02:33:46.612 --> 02:33:48.075
LAURA: Do you live here?

02:33:48.075 --> 02:33:50.677
MATT: "No, I live about three houses up."

02:33:50.677 --> 02:33:52.397
LAURA: Did you go to the carnival?

02:33:52.397 --> 02:33:53.958
MATT: "Last night? Yeah, I was there."

02:33:53.958 --> 02:33:56.351
LAURA: Okay, where were you at the carnival?

02:33:56.351 --> 02:34:00.955
MATT: "I actually snuck in under the tent after it
had started."

02:34:00.955 --> 02:34:09.513
LAURA: Right, that's a good thing. Were you close
to Enon? In the show. Were you on that side or the

02:34:09.513 --> 02:34:13.768
other side? Did you see the zombie?

02:34:13.768 --> 02:34:18.456
MATT: "I saw him a little bit. He was in the front
and I had people in front of me, but I think I saw

02:34:18.456 --> 02:34:20.532
"some of it. It was pretty cool."

02:34:20.532 --> 02:34:26.914
LAURA: It was kind of crazy, right? Have you heard
any ghost stories around town lately? About scary

02:34:26.914 --> 02:34:29.430
things happening?

02:34:30.716 --> 02:34:39.179
MATT: "My grandma told me a ghost story years ago
about these giant badger creatures that live on

02:34:39.179 --> 02:34:44.548
"the hills of the Ashkeeper that can stand up on
their hind legs, and they come down and they eat

02:34:44.548 --> 02:34:46.981
"kids that don't go to bed in time."

02:34:46.981 --> 02:34:53.953
LAURA: Oh shit. Those guys are scary, I've heard
of them. You should be really careful. Have you

02:34:53.953 --> 02:34:56.350
heard anything about zombies?

02:34:56.866 --> 02:35:00.142
MATT: "No, not since that."

02:35:02.109 --> 02:35:04.298
LIAM: What's up?

02:35:04.298 --> 02:35:07.400
LAURA: Caleb has seen some shit.

02:35:09.060 --> 02:35:11.292
MATT: "I have to finish the--"

02:35:11.361 --> 02:35:15.684
LAURA: Hey, listen, if you hear any other ghost
stories, you come and find us, okay?

02:35:15.684 --> 02:35:16.444
MATT: "Okay."

02:35:16.444 --> 02:35:18.008
LAURA: All right.

02:35:18.008 --> 02:35:20.613
(laughter)

02:35:20.613 --> 02:35:23.798
MARISHA: Are we just going from person to person
in town telling them to come find us?

02:35:23.798 --> 02:35:26.027
SAM: We are really terrible at this!

02:35:26.027 --> 02:35:29.038
TALIESIN: Well, she's making friends with
everybody. I don't see any of you making friends.

02:35:29.038 --> 02:35:31.156
TRAVIS: I'm a little concerned that we've been
gone for a while.

02:35:31.156 --> 02:35:32.724
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe we should get back.

02:35:32.724 --> 02:35:35.412
TRAVIS: Maybe let these two, that aren't under
house arrest--

02:35:35.412 --> 02:35:39.261
SAM: Continue the investigation? Or go back?

02:35:39.261 --> 02:35:44.035
TRAVIS: No, continue. I mean, if you're up for
it.

02:35:44.035 --> 02:35:46.066
SAM: Yeah, yeah, We'll be a regular--

02:35:46.066 --> 02:35:50.887
LIAM: Yeah, we've done nothing wrong. We're not
sweating it. I'm not sweating--

02:35:50.887 --> 02:35:56.234
LAURA: Yeah, I believe you completely. That was
very believable. I'm going to give you another

02:35:56.234 --> 02:35:57.792
blessing before you leave, okay?

02:35:57.792 --> 02:36:01.473
LIAM: What are you talking about? None of us did
anything. None of us! We protected the people of

02:36:01.473 --> 02:36:02.624
this town!

02:36:02.624 --> 02:36:03.613
LAURA: It's true.

02:36:03.613 --> 02:36:04.635
LIAM: It is true.

02:36:04.635 --> 02:36:05.436
LAURA: I know.

02:36:05.436 --> 02:36:09.141
LIAM: That's easy. Let's go solve a mystery,
Nott.

02:36:09.141 --> 02:36:10.570
SAM: All right.

02:36:10.570 --> 02:36:15.035
TALIESIN: Were you being sarcastic-- oh, no you
weren't, okay. Catching up on that.

02:36:15.035 --> 02:36:21.424
MARISHA: So, kids don't know anything about this,
old people don't know anything about this--

02:36:21.424 --> 02:36:23.988
TRAVIS: Tavern-keeper doesn't know anything about
this.

02:36:23.988 --> 02:36:29.815
TALIESIN: Only the pure of heart make their answer
out of riddles. Back to the tavern.

02:36:29.815 --> 02:36:36.880
MARISHA: But pure of heart! Still going back to
the guards thing! Back to the tavern, let's go.

02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:40.252
SAM: Were we just on the docks?

02:36:40.252 --> 02:36:42.301
MATT: Yeah, you guys were at the docks.

02:36:42.301 --> 02:36:43.717
LIAM: We came up with bupkus.

02:36:43.717 --> 02:36:46.090
LAURA: We didn't ask anybody, we went straight to
the house.

02:36:46.090 --> 02:36:48.191
SAM: Okay, we'll walk around the docks and look
for--

02:36:48.191 --> 02:36:50.501
TRAVIS: We'll see you back at the inn.

02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:52.973
SAM: All right.

02:36:52.973 --> 02:36:56.617
LAURA: Should we run back, or should we saunter
back?

02:36:56.617 --> 02:37:00.580
TALIESIN: You're going to probably, you know,
poof.

02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:02.093
MARISHA: Yeah, how much time does she have?

02:37:02.093 --> 02:37:03.643
LIAM: About a minute?

02:37:03.643 --> 02:37:05.585
MATT: Yeah, it's about to fade.

02:37:05.585 --> 02:37:08.607
LAURA: Yeah, I figured it had already happened
probably midway talking to the kid.

02:37:08.607 --> 02:37:10.442
MATT: Probably.

02:37:10.442 --> 02:37:14.318
MARISHA: Maybe super stealthily back?

02:37:14.318 --> 02:37:17.177
LAURA: All right. I put my hood up.

02:37:17.177 --> 02:37:20.891
TALIESIN: I can maybe put a rope through the
window.

02:37:20.891 --> 02:37:23.803
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a good idea.

02:37:23.803 --> 02:37:26.595
LAURA: Is it a two-story?

02:37:26.595 --> 02:37:28.755
MATT: It's a two-story. You guys are up in the
second story.

02:37:28.755 --> 02:37:30.180
TALIESIN: I got rope.

02:37:30.180 --> 02:37:33.195
LAURA: Let's do that, yeah. We'll sneak around the
back of the inn, and try to climb up the upstairs

02:37:33.195 --> 02:37:34.221
window.

02:37:34.221 --> 02:37:36.015
TRAVIS: I can keep them busy at the front door.

02:37:36.015 --> 02:37:38.454
TALIESIN: I'll go through the front like a proper
person.

02:37:38.454 --> 02:37:47.463
MATT: All right, so you guys are setting up a rope
to climb up the back? You go in, on your own, up

02:37:47.463 --> 02:37:48.854
to the top, you put a rope through--

02:37:48.854 --> 02:37:50.180
MARISHA: Fjord's distracting.

02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:52.866
LAURA: In the front. Then we're going to try to
sneak--

02:37:52.866 --> 02:37:56.281
TALIESIN: Right, and then I'm going to drop some
of the rope out the back window for them.

02:37:56.281 --> 02:38:00.221
MATT: Easy enough to do, so those of you who want
to wait and can take the rope up, you wait for a

02:38:00.221 --> 02:38:07.711
moment where nobody's watching and climb your way
up into the inn safely and get to your rooms. You

02:38:07.711 --> 02:38:08.949
two, what are you doing?

02:38:09.159 --> 02:38:11.639
TALIESIN: (singing) 50 feet of hemp rope, it's a
standard!

02:38:11.639 --> 02:38:13.835
LIAM: Hey kiddo, do you want a piggy-back?

02:38:13.835 --> 02:38:15.714
SAM: Sure, that sounds like a good idea.

02:38:15.714 --> 02:38:17.817
LIAM: Scramble up, let's go talk to some people.

02:38:17.817 --> 02:38:19.547
SAM: All right, I'll jump on Caleb's back.

02:38:19.547 --> 02:38:22.567
MATT: All right.

02:38:22.567 --> 02:38:26.655
LIAM: I'll wander down to where people are
working. Where people are moving crates around.

02:38:26.655 --> 02:38:28.536
MARISHA: He's on Caleb's back!

02:38:28.536 --> 02:38:32.176
MATT: Okay, that would be probably closer to the
Northward.

02:38:32.176 --> 02:38:37.107
LIAM: Okay, so that's the plan, is to look for
people moving crap around, the same way that Enon

02:38:37.107 --> 02:38:41.607
is said to have. So that's what we'll do.

02:38:41.607 --> 02:38:42.712
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

02:38:42.712 --> 02:38:43.707
LIAM: All right.

02:38:43.707 --> 02:38:44.907
SAM: Shall I help, or no?

02:38:44.907 --> 02:38:46.521
MATT: If you want to.

02:38:47.244 --> 02:38:48.791
LIAM: Not that great.

02:38:48.791 --> 02:38:53.327
MATT: You aiding him would give him an advantage
in the roll.

02:38:53.327 --> 02:38:58.818
LIAM: Oh! That didn't help. 12 for me.

02:38:58.818 --> 02:39:06.289
MATT: You take a couple hours wandering through
the Northward, asking questions, and most of the

02:39:06.289 --> 02:39:13.823
information you get is, they have no idea who that
is, or like, "Ah, he died? It's about time."

02:39:13.823 --> 02:39:19.553
LIAM: And there's no point even asking questions
because we've asked them all for two hours, yeah?

02:39:19.553 --> 02:39:21.947
MATT: I'd say yeah, based on that roll.

02:39:22.724 --> 02:39:28.814
LIAM: Okay, well that's a big zero. You want to go
book shopping with me?

02:39:28.814 --> 02:39:29.887
SAM: Sure!

02:39:29.887 --> 02:39:37.938
LIAM: Okay. I believe that gentleman said that the
Burnished Bibliots was in the Northward, correct?

02:39:37.938 --> 02:39:42.718
MATT: I believe you are correct. Yeah, it's in the
southern portion of the Northward by where it

02:39:43.023 --> 02:39:44.569
borders the Lochward.

02:39:44.569 --> 02:39:47.256
LIAM: Okay, so I'll start asking questions to get
us there.

02:39:47.256 --> 02:39:53.020
MATT: Easily enough. You eventually are led to it,
and you come to a closet that's affixed to another

02:39:53.020 --> 02:40:02.364
building. The wood used are almost driftwood and
heavily weathered, and the front door is closed as

02:40:02.364 --> 02:40:10.460
you approach. It looks like a glorified storage
shed that has been bolted and put up against

02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:12.345
another structure.

02:40:15.609 --> 02:40:18.833
LIAM: All right, well I will walk up to the door
and knock on it.

02:40:18.833 --> 02:40:22.461
MATT: Okay. (knocks) No response.

02:40:22.461 --> 02:40:32.775
LIAM: Is there any breaks in the door or the
building or cracks that Frumpkin could fit into?

02:40:32.775 --> 02:40:35.929
MATT: Visual glance, there look like there's that
space underneath the door.

02:40:35.929 --> 02:40:38.272
Probably not enough for a cat to slip through.

02:40:38.627 --> 02:40:42.259
LIAM: Are there any windows or anything or is it
all a big, dirty, dingy mess?

02:40:42.259 --> 02:40:46.587
MATT: There are windows, but if you look at the
back of the windows all you see is scraps of

02:40:46.587 --> 02:40:54.648
material, stacks of books, piles of boxes and
crates, it's literally blocked out with things

02:40:54.648 --> 02:40:56.811
stacked up against it from the interior.

02:40:56.811 --> 02:40:59.345
LIAM: How busy is the front of this place?

02:40:59.345 --> 02:41:02.631
MATT: Not busy at all, it's just the two of you,
right now, standing at the front door.

02:41:02.631 --> 02:41:05.014
LIAM: No one's around us, though?

02:41:05.169 --> 02:41:09.979
MATT: It's not on the main street, it's a little
pushed back, recessed about ten or 15 feet from

02:41:09.979 --> 02:41:13.869
the main road so there's no one immediately around
you. But there are people walking back and forth

02:41:13.869 --> 02:41:19.149
on the road behind but you're out in the open, per
se.

02:41:19.149 --> 02:41:21.123
SAM: And no one's coming to the door?

02:41:21.123 --> 02:41:22.892
MATT: No one's come to the door yet, no.

02:41:22.892 --> 02:41:25.523
SAM: Want me to break in?

02:41:25.523 --> 02:41:28.232
LIAM: Yes. No.

02:41:28.232 --> 02:41:30.621
[knocking]

02:41:30.621 --> 02:41:42.820
MATT: Okay. A moment passes and you hear, "Hold
on!" The door opens. It was open. There's the

02:41:43.384 --> 02:41:50.234
sound of heavy sacks go tumbling down to the
interior of it and you glance around and you hear

02:41:50.234 --> 02:41:53.469
a voice go, "Can I help you?"

02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:54.671
LIAM: Hello?

02:41:54.671 --> 02:41:59.882
MATT: You look down, and there's this
crotchety-looking scrawny old gnome who's sitting

02:41:59.882 --> 02:42:06.771
there in the doorway. He's got this vibrant puff,
like a cotton ball, of hair around his head. But

02:42:06.771 --> 02:42:13.515
it's this perfect "U" of bald on top. No glasses,
eyes are very small and beady, and he has this

02:42:13.515 --> 02:42:18.333
bulbous, round nose at the front with this little
bit of a tuft of chin white hair that matches the

02:42:18.333 --> 02:42:23.147
cotton ball tuft on the sides. He's sitting there
clutching the top of the knob on the inside which

02:42:23.147 --> 02:42:28.840
is actually affixed shorter on the door and he
goes, "Well come in."

02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:31.110
LIAM: Yes please, you're open for business I take
it.

02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:33.298
MATT: "Always open, come on in."

02:42:33.298 --> 02:42:34.415
LIAM: All right.

02:42:34.415 --> 02:42:38.380
MATT: Turns around and musters his way inside. As
soon as you step in the door and look around, this

02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:44.696
place looks like an episode of Hoarders. It is
just floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall, stacks of

02:42:44.696 --> 02:42:52.053
anything and everything: knick-knacks, small
stuffed animals, toys, books, glasses, and

02:42:52.053 --> 02:43:01.093
goblets. It is the biggest, crammed flea-market
into a small shed-like space you've seen.

02:43:03.618 --> 02:43:05.721
SAM: I start unscrewing my flask.

02:43:05.721 --> 02:43:08.282
(laughing)

02:43:11.252 --> 02:43:19.364
LIAM: Frumpkin climbs back up onto Nott's shoulder
and nestles in.

02:43:19.364 --> 02:43:23.175
MATT: (meowing)

02:43:24.703 --> 02:43:30.107
LIAM: I am scouting the city for books, I am
starved for books.

02:43:30.107 --> 02:43:31.753
MATT: "Well we've got books here."

02:43:31.753 --> 02:43:34.439
LIAM: Yes sir, I'm sorry what is your name?

02:43:34.439 --> 02:43:38.135
MATT: "Oglen. Oglen Hornsblower."

02:43:38.135 --> 02:43:39.700
LIAM: Oglen Hornsblower.

02:43:39.700 --> 02:43:44.730
MATT: "And welcome to my collection. You want to
buy something, let me know."

02:43:44.730 --> 02:43:50.512
LIAM: Well I see you sell a great many things in
here, books included. This is just things you've

02:43:50.512 --> 02:43:52.268
collected throughout your lifetime?

02:43:52.268 --> 02:43:55.521
MATT: "Right. Boughten, traded for, found."

02:43:55.521 --> 02:44:03.380
LIAM: I don't know what you just said, but I am
interested in books. Particularly in the arcane

02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:10.307
realm, but any kind of book. Do you have anything
that you just outright know is out of the

02:44:10.307 --> 02:44:11.714
ordinary?

02:44:11.714 --> 02:44:17.140
MATT: "I'm sure we've got a few. Look around! See
what you find. It's half the fun, half the

02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:18.753
"journey."

02:44:18.753 --> 02:44:29.438
LIAM: All right, friend, let's-- It's like
Winter's Crest morning for me and I'm scanning the

02:44:29.438 --> 02:44:30.485
shelves.

02:44:30.485 --> 02:44:32.557
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:44:32.557 --> 02:44:37.941
SAM: Can you give me something to look for? To
distract me and give me a mission to go on,

02:44:37.941 --> 02:44:39.556
please?

02:44:39.556 --> 02:44:44.328
LIAM: Yes. You want to find some sort of tool that
helps you do what you do best.

02:44:48.258 --> 02:44:50.066
SAM: All right.

02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:56.132
LIAM: Investigation check, that is a 21.

02:44:56.132 --> 02:44:57.604
MATT: 21?

02:44:57.604 --> 02:45:04.533
SAM: I rolled a 21 investigation check.

02:45:04.533 --> 02:45:05.903
MATT: All right.

02:45:05.903 --> 02:45:09.506
SAM: I'm just looking for baubles to steal.

02:45:09.506 --> 02:45:12.727
(laughter)

02:45:12.727 --> 02:45:19.638
MATT: All right. In thumbing through, there are
plenty of books that, within a first glance,

02:45:19.638 --> 02:45:23.663
"This is not of interest to me." You have to move things
out of the way and push things aside.

02:45:23.735 --> 02:45:28.041
The smell in there is dusty and moldy 
and you do find there is

02:45:28.041 --> 02:45:30.762
some subtle water damage and some mildew growing

02:45:30.762 --> 02:45:36.371
in one far corner and you're like ugh, put that
back. However, you rolled really high. Two things

02:45:36.371 --> 02:45:42.482
catch your eye. One, there appears to be the
remnants of some sort of notebook, a sketchbook

02:45:42.482 --> 02:45:46.685
that is written in a language you do not
understand-- What languages do you know?

02:45:46.685 --> 02:45:54.086
LIAM: Well, off the bat, I don't know where that
is in D&amp;D Beyond yet. But if I open up my binder I

02:45:54.086 --> 02:46:04.434
bet I have a paper version that I can verify with.
I speak Sylvan, Common, and Celestial and I also

02:46:04.434 --> 02:46:09.815
can Comprehend Languages as a ritual spell but I
think that takes some time.

02:46:09.815 --> 02:46:10.882
MATT: It does take ten minutes.

02:46:10.882 --> 02:46:12.694
LIAM: Ten minutes.

02:46:12.694 --> 02:46:16.144
MATT: But you glance through the book, and while
you cannot read the text you do recognize that

02:46:16.144 --> 02:46:26.633
there are elements at the back of the book that
have a hint of arcane nature. That's one of two

02:46:26.633 --> 02:46:28.878
books you find with that roll.

02:46:28.878 --> 02:46:30.822
SAM: It's like the adult section for him.

02:46:30.822 --> 02:46:36.774
MATT: I know. The second book you find is written
in Zemnian, which you can read.

02:46:36.774 --> 02:46:38.109
LIAM: That's correct.

02:46:38.109 --> 02:46:41.653
MATT: The title translates to Fiends of Folklore.

02:46:44.239 --> 02:46:52.991
LIAM: I'm so happy. You have quite a shop here.

02:46:52.991 --> 02:46:55.201
MATT: "I know I do!"

02:46:55.201 --> 02:46:59.659
LIAM: You have some real treasures. I'm
particularly interested in both of these books.

02:46:59.659 --> 02:47:02.921
MATT: "Good choices, good choices."

02:47:05.616 --> 02:47:11.734
LIAM: I don't know though, I don't think that-- I
mean I'm rather tight on coin at the moment so--

02:47:12.208 --> 02:47:13.847
MATT: "That's too bad."

02:47:13.847 --> 02:47:16.471
LIAM: Maybe my eyes are too big for my stomach.

02:47:16.471 --> 02:47:18.016
MATT: He's pulling the books away from you.

02:47:18.016 --> 02:47:21.843
LIAM: How much would you part with these for?

02:47:21.843 --> 02:47:33.317
MATT: (sniffs) He holds of the Fiends of Folklore
book, "Three gold pieces. This one, (sniffs)--

02:47:38.547 --> 02:47:42.704
"ten gold pieces."

02:47:42.711 --> 02:47:44.142
LIAM: Which one is which?

02:47:44.142 --> 02:47:46.824
MATT: The Fiends of Folklore is the three, the
other tome.

02:47:46.824 --> 02:47:49.187
LIAM: The arcane, weird one.

02:47:49.187 --> 02:47:51.105
MATT: You're not quite sure what's in it.

02:47:51.105 --> 02:47:59.543
LIAM: Okay. Would you have any interest in a magic
cat?

02:48:01.653 --> 02:48:03.530
MATT: "I'm sorry?"

02:48:04.372 --> 02:48:13.058
LIAM: Frumpkin disappears from on Nott's shoulder.
Reappears next to the little man.

02:48:13.058 --> 02:48:18.201
MATT: (yelps) He like throws the books and grabs
nearby this large sack and starts--

02:48:20.051 --> 02:48:21.888
angrily beating the cat.

02:48:23.497 --> 02:48:25.251
LIAM: I'll take that as a no!

02:48:25.251 --> 02:48:27.561
TRAVIS: Childhood cat, destroyed!

02:48:28.251 --> 02:48:35.594
MATT: He does hit Frumpkin. Frumpkin takes one
point of bludgeoning damage.

02:48:35.594 --> 02:48:44.595
LIAM: That might be it, I don't really know. I
didn't think that this would happen so quickly.

02:48:44.595 --> 02:48:47.595
TRAVIS: Faced with our own mortality.

02:48:49.616 --> 02:48:51.046
LAURA: Frumpkin point two.

02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:59.922
MARISHA: Yeah, he updates overnight as long as
he's plugged in, right?

02:48:59.922 --> 02:49:02.999
LIAM: Hold on, I have to see if Frumpkin is still
here.

02:49:02.999 --> 02:49:05.047
TRAVIS: Must be plugged in and connected to Wifi.

02:49:05.047 --> 02:49:07.195
MARISHA: Type in your passcode if you agree to the
terms.

02:49:07.195 --> 02:49:08.386
LIAM: One hit point of damage?

02:49:08.386 --> 02:49:09.322
MATT: Yes.

02:49:09.322 --> 02:49:10.772
LIAM: He's still here.

02:49:10.772 --> 02:49:12.532
MATT: There you go. Frumpkin immediately darts off
jumps on your shoulder, turns around and

02:49:12.532 --> 02:49:15.006
(hisses).

02:49:15.006 --> 02:49:19.070
LIAM: So you don't like cats, I understand that.

02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:23.099
MATT: "Sorry, it caught me off-guard."

02:49:23.099 --> 02:49:27.611
LIAM: Well I was trying to sample the merchandise
for you. Because if it was just a cat it was just

02:49:27.611 --> 02:49:33.420
a cat, but this one-- changes to my other
shoulder-- he's a magic cat.

02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:35.852
MATT: "Okay."

02:49:35.852 --> 02:49:39.286
LIAM: You can roll him in mud, he comes back
clean. He disappears, he reappears, he brings you

02:49:39.286 --> 02:49:40.832
things.

02:49:40.832 --> 02:49:43.439
MATT: "Can you make him go away?"

02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:45.128
LIAM: Gone.

02:49:45.128 --> 02:49:48.512
MATT: "Thank you. Now we can continue to talk
money."

02:49:51.831 --> 02:50:03.324
LIAM: Here's what I propose. I do not have ten
gold at the moment. But it doesn't feel like you

02:50:03.324 --> 02:50:12.395
get a lot of thoroughfare here, so I'm going to
come back to purchase this later. That's it.

02:50:12.395 --> 02:50:16.411
That's the end of my spiel; that's all I've got.
I'm interested, and thank you for giving me the

02:50:16.411 --> 02:50:17.495
time.

02:50:17.495 --> 02:50:19.865
MATT: "Of course. Sorry about your cat, friend."

02:50:19.865 --> 02:50:23.535
LIAM: It's okay. Nott?

02:50:23.535 --> 02:50:25.209
SAM: Have I heard all of this conversation?

02:50:25.209 --> 02:50:31.380
MATT: You've been hearing all of it, but you've
also found, amongst the chaos, a brass baby bottle

02:50:31.380 --> 02:50:38.767
that's fairly dented, but it's very shiny and
polished, you can already see on the inside. You

02:50:38.767 --> 02:50:48.404
find a new flask, actually. It's very tarnished,
but you spit and rub it a little bit. It looks to

02:50:48.404 --> 02:50:52.304
be of very fine metallic material. You're not
entirely sure, you'd have to clean it, but it

02:50:52.304 --> 02:50:55.728
looks like very nice quality material.

02:50:55.728 --> 02:51:01.114
SAM: All right. I'll try to trade my flask with
that flask.

02:51:01.114 --> 02:51:03.267
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

02:51:03.267 --> 02:51:04.747
TRAVIS: Indiana Jones style.

02:51:06.267 --> 02:51:07.859
SAM: 22!

02:51:08.279 --> 02:51:09.824
TALIESIN: How?!

02:51:09.824 --> 02:51:13.123
SAM: Wait. More. No, that's right. 22.

02:51:13.123 --> 02:51:17.125
MATT: Now, your flask, which still has liquor in
it, is left behind for the empty flask you

02:51:17.125 --> 02:51:22.802
receive. However, without an instance of anyone
even paying attention. It is yours. You can write

02:51:22.802 --> 02:51:26.500
in your inventory you are now the owner of a
platinum flask.

02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:29.046
ALL: Ooh!

02:51:29.046 --> 02:51:36.319
SAM: Shit! Okay! It's a baby bottle, or maybe a
rattle? What'd you say?

02:51:36.319 --> 02:51:43.325
MATT: Baby bottle. Looks like it was used as a
bottle for a very upper-class family.

02:51:43.325 --> 02:51:45.732
TALIESIN: You're already so ahead, though!

02:51:45.732 --> 02:51:53.620
SAM: I know. But I can't resist. I'll try to take
one more look and pocket that as well.

02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:55.501
MATT: Make another sleight of hand check, please.

02:51:55.501 --> 02:51:57.286
SAM: 20.

02:51:57.286 --> 02:52:03.312
MATT: It just vanishes into your cloak! It's the
craziest thing! It was there and it's gone!

02:52:03.312 --> 02:52:06.309
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:12.503
SAM: Are we going to leave now? Should we leave? I
think we should leave. Maybe we should go. Do you

02:52:12.503 --> 02:52:15.219
need some money? I could lend you some money, if
you want.

02:52:15.219 --> 02:52:17.306
LIAM: Maybe we'll come back tomorrow.

02:52:17.306 --> 02:52:22.102
SAM: All right. Lovely place you got here!

02:52:22.102 --> 02:52:23.389
LIAM: Piggyback?

02:52:23.389 --> 02:52:25.459
SAM: Yes, please!

02:52:25.459 --> 02:52:27.800
MATT: "I'll hold these books for you! Come back
when you can!"

02:52:27.800 --> 02:52:30.384
LIAM: Within the week, I promise.

02:52:30.384 --> 02:52:33.334
MATT: "All right. Have a good day, little girl!"

02:52:33.334 --> 02:52:36.175
SAM: I will!

02:52:36.175 --> 02:52:38.500
MATT: You guys exit the building.

02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:45.604
SAM: I'm sorry! I did it again, I couldn't help
it. I took some things. Do you think he noticed?

02:52:45.604 --> 02:52:49.043
Do you think we're in trouble? Maybe we should
hurry back.

02:52:49.043 --> 02:52:51.768
LIAM: I don't think he saw.

02:52:51.768 --> 02:52:54.994
SAM: All right. Are you cross with me?

02:52:54.994 --> 02:53:00.316
LIAM: No. Just wait one moment, okay? Wait for me
here?

02:53:00.316 --> 02:53:06.374
SAM: Okay. I heard you talking about money, by the
way, I could lend you some, if you'd like.

02:53:06.972 --> 02:53:14.254
LIAM: Wait right here. I cast Detect Magic just
before I walk back into the store. I look all

02:53:14.254 --> 02:53:22.503
around. What are your hours, here? As I look to
see if there is anything besides that book,

02:53:22.503 --> 02:53:24.360
anything.

02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:29.390
MATT: You glance throughout the interior, and you
don't sense anything magical, unfortunately,

02:53:29.390 --> 02:53:31.538
within the piles of rubble.

02:53:31.538 --> 02:53:33.317
LIAM: Besides the book he put down?

02:53:33.317 --> 02:53:39.927
MATT: The book's not radiating any magical aura.
But he answers. "Oh! All hours! I don't really

02:53:39.927 --> 02:53:42.249
"close. I don't really sleep."

02:53:42.249 --> 02:53:43.552
LIAM: Middle of the night, even?

02:53:43.552 --> 02:53:44.667
MATT: "Sure!"

02:53:44.667 --> 02:53:46.947
LIAM: All right. Business is business. Thank you!

02:53:46.947 --> 02:53:49.005
MATT: "No worries. See you then!"

02:53:49.005 --> 02:53:50.725
LIAM: Bis später.

02:53:50.725 --> 02:53:52.678
MATT: "Pee shmiter!"

02:53:54.926 --> 02:53:56.670
LIAM: That guy does not speak Zemnian!

02:53:56.670 --> 02:53:58.522
MATT: No, he does not.

02:54:01.916 --> 02:54:04.311
LIAM: Let's go back to the hotel, shall we?

02:54:04.311 --> 02:54:06.429
SAM: Let's do it.

02:54:06.429 --> 02:54:12.722
MATT: While they're away, you guys wait there for
a bit, getting stir crazy in the process of

02:54:12.722 --> 02:54:18.057
waiting in your room. Jester and Beauregard,
there's a knock at your door.

02:54:20.165 --> 02:54:22.603
LAURA: Hello?

02:54:22.603 --> 02:54:25.555
MATT: "Please open, it's Crownsguard."

02:54:25.555 --> 02:54:28.038
LAURA: Hold on, I'm naked!

02:54:28.038 --> 02:54:33.558
(whispering) Yeah, I don't know. Do you 
want to put clothes on?

02:54:33.558 --> 02:54:35.707
Should we take our clothes off?

02:54:36.839 --> 02:54:40.254
MARISHA: Did you say that because you wanted to
tell me something?

02:54:40.254 --> 02:54:46.121
LAURA: No, I just wanted to make them wait. Okay,
I'm dressed now!

02:54:46.121 --> 02:54:50.632
MARISHA: I like that. We're giving them--
authority. Got the upper hand. Okay.

02:54:50.632 --> 02:54:52.401
LAURA: It's a power play.

02:54:52.401 --> 02:54:56.042
MARISHA: Do we invite them in or are we going
to--? You open the door. I'm going to sit,

02:54:56.042 --> 02:54:57.945
unassuming, on the bed.

02:54:57.945 --> 02:55:00.835
LAURA: Sit! Come in, please.

02:55:00.835 --> 02:55:03.212
MARISHA: Oh!

02:55:04.161 --> 02:55:08.270
MATT: The door opens, and there are two
crownsguards there, standing, shields to the

02:55:08.270 --> 02:55:09.359
side.

02:55:09.359 --> 02:55:12.219
LAURA: Oh hello, I wasn't expecting you.

02:55:12.219 --> 02:55:15.943
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, hi.

02:55:15.943 --> 02:55:20.613
MATT: "We're here to notify you that the
investigation is ongoing. You will not be needed

02:55:20.613 --> 02:55:25.198
"today. Please remain in your premises. Be back
tomorrow."

02:55:25.198 --> 02:55:26.623
TRAVIS: Jury summon.

02:55:26.623 --> 02:55:32.573
MARISHA: Bullshit! Jury duty shit! Goddamn it!

02:55:32.891 --> 02:55:34.542
TALIESIN: We are at D&amp;D Jury Duty.

02:55:34.542 --> 02:55:37.713
MATT: Yes you are.

02:55:37.713 --> 02:55:41.601
MARISHA: Seven dollars a day? What is this shit?

02:55:41.601 --> 02:55:43.654
LAURA: Can I ask you a question before you leave?

02:55:43.654 --> 02:55:45.260
MATT: "Yes, what is your question?"

02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:48.967
LAURA: Are you guys going to be the same people
coming back tomorrow?

02:55:48.967 --> 02:55:49.998
MATT: "Possibly."

02:55:49.998 --> 02:55:52.222
LAURA: What is your names?

02:55:52.222 --> 02:55:56.870
MATT: They look at each other, look back at you.
"I am Jonas." The other guy pipes up, he's a

02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:59.438
little younger, he goes, "I am Lucas."

02:55:59.438 --> 02:56:02.437
LAURA: Jonas and Lucas, very good names.

02:56:02.437 --> 02:56:06.781
MARISHA: You guys should start a band. Like a boy
band or something.

02:56:06.781 --> 02:56:15.613
LAURA: Yeah, that'd be good. Girls would go crazy.
If you guys want to play some games tomorrow,

02:56:15.613 --> 02:56:18.200
we'll just be here!

02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:25.225
MATT: "Very well! Have a good day." They look at
each other like, "What?" and close the door.

02:56:25.225 --> 02:56:28.472
LAURA: I shouldn't have offered the game. What if
we want to leave and then they want to take us up

02:56:28.472 --> 02:56:30.096
on the game thing?

02:56:30.096 --> 02:56:31.574
MARISHA: I thought you enjoyed games.

02:56:31.574 --> 02:56:33.107
LAURA: No, I love games!

02:56:33.107 --> 02:56:34.064
MARISHA: Sure.

02:56:34.064 --> 02:56:37.693
LAURA: But what if we leave and then they want to
&lt;i&gt;play&lt;/i&gt; games?

02:56:37.693 --> 02:56:40.322
MARISHA: Okay.

02:56:40.322 --> 02:56:43.982
MATT: Onto Fjord's door.

02:56:43.982 --> 02:56:45.968
TALIESIN: I'm sitting playing with the cards.

02:56:45.968 --> 02:56:47.539
TRAVIS: I open it.

02:56:47.539 --> 02:56:58.326
MATT: Same two guards there. Lucas and Jonas.
Jonas and Lucas. "Hello. The investigation is

02:56:58.326 --> 02:57:02.294
"ongoing. You'll not be needed for today. We will
return tomorrow."

02:57:02.294 --> 02:57:03.988
TRAVIS: I shut the door.

02:57:03.988 --> 02:57:05.417
TALIESIN: Any progress?

02:57:05.417 --> 02:57:13.286
MATT: There's a pause and then you here the subtle
shifting of greaves against the wooden floor as

02:57:13.286 --> 02:57:15.693
they slowly walk away.

02:57:15.693 --> 02:57:18.868
TRAVIS: Go take that game in the other room, why
don't you?

02:57:18.868 --> 02:57:20.711
TALIESIN: That was a power move right there.

02:57:20.711 --> 02:57:22.767
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:57:22.767 --> 02:57:24.877
MATT: You guys return to the inn.

02:57:27.177 --> 02:57:28.811
SAM: I guess we do.

02:57:28.999 --> 02:57:30.252
MATT: Yes you do.

02:57:31.131 --> 02:57:36.553
SAM: Well. That was terrible. No one found out
anything. It was a waste of a day. We're all

02:57:36.553 --> 02:57:40.568
terrible at this. Goodnight?

02:57:40.568 --> 02:57:42.891
LAURA: What time is it?

02:57:42.891 --> 02:57:48.884
MARISHA: That's not true! I still say that some of
the best information that you can get can be in

02:57:48.884 --> 02:57:51.464
the information that you don't find.

02:57:51.464 --> 02:57:53.571
SAM: That is nonsense.

02:57:53.571 --> 02:57:59.189
MARISHA: I'm just saying! Sometimes the lack of
information can be a process of elimination.

02:58:01.897 --> 02:58:03.518
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:58:03.593 --> 02:58:05.678
MARISHA: It's super broad!

02:58:05.678 --> 02:58:08.723
TALIESIN: No, you know what? I'm going to take
it.

02:58:08.723 --> 02:58:16.296
MARISHA: I'm trying to be fucking silver lining,
so I don't feel like a piece of shit for waste a

02:58:16.296 --> 02:58:19.094
day, and you guys are shitting on that, but it's
fine.

02:58:19.094 --> 02:58:21.234
TRAVIS: You found nothing at the docks, zip,
zero?

02:58:21.234 --> 02:58:25.106
LIAM: We spent hours there, no one knew anything
about the old man.

02:58:25.106 --> 02:58:34.317
MARISHA: See? No one knew anything about him. That
means, prime candidate, someone's little

02:58:34.317 --> 02:58:39.137
experiment. Little Frankenstein. I'm telling you.

02:58:39.137 --> 02:58:41.108
LIAM: I don't really understand what she's
saying.

02:58:41.108 --> 02:58:45.284
LAURA: I don't either. I'm going to run up and
down the stairs for a while.

02:58:46.254 --> 02:58:49.121
MATT: (quick footsteps)

02:58:49.121 --> 02:58:51.814
TALIESIN: How long have you known this one?

02:58:51.820 --> 02:58:53.408
MARISHA: Who are you talking to?

02:58:53.408 --> 02:58:55.619
TALIESIN: Anybody who's watching this happen.

02:58:55.619 --> 02:59:00.339
MARISHA: About 24 hours longer than you have.

02:59:00.339 --> 02:59:01.873
TALIESIN: That explains a lot.

02:59:01.873 --> 02:59:07.668
MATT: At one point, Adelaine the barmaid comes up.
"I'm sorry, can you &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt; stop?"

02:59:08.920 --> 02:59:10.059
LAURA: Okay.

02:59:10.059 --> 02:59:12.521
MATT: "Thank you!"

02:59:12.894 --> 02:59:14.340
SAM: Hey, Dungeon Master?

02:59:14.340 --> 02:59:15.626
MATT: Yes?

02:59:15.626 --> 02:59:23.719
SAM: The other night, when Nott was out carousing
a bit while Caleb was asleep. He saw some figures

02:59:23.719 --> 02:59:30.677
in cloaks dash by. Was there any distinctive
anything about these three figures that

02:59:30.677 --> 02:59:31.764
dashed by?

02:59:31.764 --> 02:59:33.811
MATT: Not that you noticed, unfortunately.

02:59:33.811 --> 02:59:41.895
SAM: Damn it. Okay, I will share that information
with the group. I saw some weirdos running

02:59:41.895 --> 02:59:43.458
around.

02:59:43.458 --> 02:59:45.682
LAURA: When?

02:59:45.682 --> 02:59:47.660
SAM: The other night, when he was asleep.

02:59:47.660 --> 02:59:49.321
TRAVIS: How late?

02:59:49.321 --> 02:59:51.131
SAM: Two in the morning?

02:59:51.131 --> 02:59:53.491
LIAM: You were out that late?

02:59:53.491 --> 02:59:54.921
SAM: Sorry.

02:59:54.921 --> 02:59:57.717
LAURA: Maybe we should go out at two o'clock in
the morning and see if we can find them.

02:59:57.717 --> 02:59:59.036
MARISHA: Ooh, that's a good idea.

02:59:59.036 --> 03:00:00.350
LAURA: Follow them.

03:00:00.350 --> 03:00:04.910
MARISHA: You guys notice that it's weird that no
one's actually really talking about this? This is

03:00:04.910 --> 03:00:09.983
a small town. I come from a small town. Small town
people gossip.

03:00:09.983 --> 03:00:14.976
TALIESIN: I feel like there should be some more
gossip then there is, that's very true.

03:00:14.976 --> 03:00:20.561
MARISHA: Someone is talking about this, we just
haven't found them yet. 2:00AM field trip!

03:00:20.561 --> 03:00:22.997
LAURA: We can always leave through the window this
time.

03:00:22.997 --> 03:00:25.530
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, I like that.

03:00:25.530 --> 03:00:27.688
TRAVIS: I can be down for that.

03:00:27.688 --> 03:00:34.692
TALIESIN: I leave the rope tied in here. Can we
use your cat? Reel it back up in so that there's

03:00:34.928 --> 03:00:38.489
no trace of us until we need to get back there.

03:00:38.489 --> 03:00:41.461
LIAM: Are you asking for my cat to haul up our
rope?

03:00:41.461 --> 03:00:44.214
TALIESIN: No, I'm telling you that your cat is
going to haul up a rope.

03:00:44.214 --> 03:00:46.318
LAURA: How is a cat going to lift up a rope?

03:00:46.318 --> 03:00:49.440
TALIESIN: It's not that heavy of a rope, it's just
hemp.

03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:52.792
MATT: Hemp rope can be pretty heavy.

03:00:52.792 --> 03:00:56.263
TALIESIN: Well, if I throw it back up there then I
imagine you cat can knock it back down at the very

03:00:56.263 --> 03:00:57.299
least.

03:00:57.299 --> 03:00:59.423
LAURA: There, that would work, maybe.

03:00:59.423 --> 03:01:01.829
MARISHA: Oh, is he like an asshole cat?

03:01:01.829 --> 03:01:05.021
TALIESIN: I assume he's an asshole cat. Aren't all
cats asshole cats?

03:01:05.021 --> 03:01:06.830
MATT: This is true.

03:01:06.830 --> 03:01:10.425
LAURA: It might be down before we come back, is
the thing.

03:01:10.872 --> 03:01:13.738
TALIESIN: I assume he's going to-- that's fair.

03:01:13.738 --> 03:01:19.322
TRAVIS: Where were you when you saw these cloaked
figures?

03:01:19.322 --> 03:01:23.567
SAM: I had gone out to do some window shopping.

03:01:23.567 --> 03:01:25.829
TRAVIS: At 2:00AM?

03:01:25.829 --> 03:01:31.674
SAM: Yes, I wasn't very successful. I had walked
by the general store--

03:01:31.674 --> 03:01:33.289
LAURA: Oh, we went there.

03:01:33.289 --> 03:01:34.524
MARISHA: Yeah, we did.

03:01:34.524 --> 03:01:41.611
SAM: I passed by a place called Natural Remedies,
herbs and medicinal things. I went by a spot named

03:01:41.611 --> 03:01:45.344
Jackalwere, it's a smithy.

03:01:45.344 --> 03:01:47.611
LAURA: Okay, but where did you see the cloaked
guys?

03:01:47.611 --> 03:01:50.306
SAM: It was between-- I don't remember.

03:01:50.306 --> 03:01:54.937
MATT: It was one block north of the Natural
Remedies.

03:01:54.937 --> 03:01:58.663
MARISHA: Natural Remedies. What was the other one?
Jackalwere?

03:01:58.663 --> 03:02:00.278
SAM: I think that was what it was called.

03:02:00.278 --> 03:02:02.932
MATT: Yeah, Jackalwere Smiths.

03:02:06.202 --> 03:02:08.277
SAM: We could do a little stakeout!

03:02:08.451 --> 03:02:10.542
TRAVIS: We could.

03:02:10.542 --> 03:02:17.654
MARISHA: That's true. How do people send messages
in this town? Have we figured that out?

03:02:17.654 --> 03:02:20.555
SAM: Probably by foot or by horse, right?

03:02:22.215 --> 03:02:23.964
TALIESIN: Not that big of a town.

03:02:23.964 --> 03:02:26.742
TRAVIS: Should someone stay up? Well, I was
thinking someone should keep a lookout on the roof

03:02:26.742 --> 03:02:29.794
of the inn in case someone comes for us while
everyone else is out.

03:02:29.794 --> 03:02:32.471
LAURA: How would we let anybody know?

03:02:32.471 --> 03:02:39.235
TRAVIS: I don't know. Can you conjure those golden
orbs up into the air as like a signal?

03:02:39.235 --> 03:02:43.780
LIAM: It's pretty limited. They don't go that
far.

03:02:43.780 --> 03:02:46.256
TRAVIS: Maybe we just risk it.

03:02:46.256 --> 03:02:47.235
SAM: Yeah!

03:02:47.235 --> 03:02:49.599
LAURA: Let's risk it.

03:02:49.599 --> 03:02:53.953
TRAVIS: It's 2:00AM, I'm sure everybody will be
asleep. Let's risk it.

03:02:57.941 --> 03:03:03.775
MARISHA: Before we leave--

03:03:08.509 --> 03:03:12.725
is there a window in
the hall? Or are there only windows in our bedrooms?

03:03:12.725 --> 03:03:15.457
MATT: There is no window in the hall, only in the
rooms.

03:03:15.457 --> 03:03:19.155
MARISHA: Okay, that's fine. On our side of the
room--

03:03:19.155 --> 03:03:23.236
MATT: You have three rooms between you.

03:03:23.236 --> 03:03:24.709
TALIESIN: There's three rooms and they all have
windows.

03:03:24.709 --> 03:03:26.227
MATT: Correct.

03:03:26.227 --> 03:03:38.920
MARISHA: On our side of the door, I'm going to
take out my healer's kit. Do I have any bandages

03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:43.483
or medical tape or anything like that?

03:03:43.483 --> 03:03:50.690
MATT: Not medical tape, but there are clean strips
of cloth and some adhesive bandages, basic

03:03:50.690 --> 03:03:51.731
general--

03:03:51.731 --> 03:03:53.494
LAURA: No tape?!

03:03:54.643 --> 03:04:03.585
MARISHA: I'm going to tie a bandage ever so
lightly around one side of the handle onto

03:04:03.607 --> 03:04:10.728
something on to the other side of the door. If
there's something like a lamp or some kind of pipe

03:04:10.728 --> 03:04:12.920
or something I can tie it to.

03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:14.542
LAURA: So that we'll know if someone tried to come
in the room?

03:04:14.542 --> 03:04:15.538
MARISHA: Correct.

03:04:15.538 --> 03:04:17.090
LAURA: Okay.

03:04:17.090 --> 03:04:24.895
MATT: You can pull one bandage out and affix to
one of the chair legs nearby. You could do that.

03:04:24.895 --> 03:04:27.800
TALIESIN: Oh for god's sake. I pull out a big
thing of string.

03:04:29.477 --> 03:04:34.137
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. I'll take some string and
just some twine and--

03:04:34.712 --> 03:04:37.999
LAURA: What are we going to do? Leave through our
window?

03:04:37.999 --> 03:04:39.152
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:04:39.152 --> 03:04:41.749
LAURA: To their window?

03:04:41.749 --> 03:04:44.849
MARISHA: Well, I figured we're all in the same
room at this point.

03:04:44.849 --> 03:04:47.256
LIAM: What are you trying to do?

03:04:47.256 --> 03:04:52.176
MARISHA: I'm trying to make sure that if someone
tries to come in our room we'll know if they come in.

03:04:52.367 --> 03:04:53.890
LIAM: I can take care of that.

03:04:53.890 --> 03:04:55.907
TALIESIN: Oh, well then, I'm taking my string
back.

03:04:55.907 --> 03:04:57.663
MARISHA: What can you do?

03:04:57.663 --> 03:05:01.175
LIAM: I have some magic for that.

03:05:02.513 --> 03:05:08.176
SAM: Yeah, he has a magical spell that alerts you
when someone tries to break in your room.

03:05:08.176 --> 03:05:15.857
LIAM: That is correct. Yeah. I will take a moment
to do that and it will let me know.

03:05:15.857 --> 03:05:19.964
SAM: Best part is, it doesn't alert him when I
sneak in or out.

03:05:19.964 --> 03:05:21.487
LIAM: That you know of.

03:05:21.487 --> 03:05:24.135
SAM: Wait. What?

03:05:28.424 --> 03:05:30.415
LIAM: One mile of the warded area.

03:05:30.415 --> 03:05:31.686
SAM: Ooh!

03:05:31.686 --> 03:05:33.532
MARISHA: That's better! Let's do that.

03:05:33.532 --> 03:05:37.660
LIAM: I just need ten minutes. And I pull out a
little spool of silvered thread and stretch it

03:05:37.660 --> 03:05:42.459
out. Where did you want this? Over the window?

03:05:42.459 --> 03:05:48.437
MARISHA: Well, I was going to say in the door, but
if there's maybe a place in the hall.

03:05:48.437 --> 03:05:54.241
LIAM: Well, I can do the entire room really, I can
go doorknob to-- The funny thing about this

03:05:54.241 --> 03:05:59.870
thread, there's no end to it. So I start looping
it all the way around the room and tie it off, and

03:05:59.870 --> 03:06:05.963
take out one of my books from the holster, the one
on the left side, and I open it up. You guys watch

03:06:05.963 --> 03:06:11.829
as I spend ten minutes referring to the book and
tracing symbols on the floor. Along, underneath

03:06:11.829 --> 03:06:20.194
the thread, and about ten minutes of time, nothing
happens, but that's taken care of.

03:06:20.682 --> 03:06:22.130
LAURA: Nice.

03:06:22.130 --> 03:06:23.760
SAM: See, he's really good.

03:06:23.760 --> 03:06:25.121
LAURA: Yeah.

03:06:25.121 --> 03:06:27.505
TRAVIS: Didn't really look like much.

03:06:27.522 --> 03:06:30.570
LIAM: Yeah, either that or I'm really bullshitting
you and nothing happened.

03:06:30.570 --> 03:06:35.036
LAURA: Either way, I liked it. Let's sneak out.

03:06:35.036 --> 03:06:38.220
TALIESIN: I'm going to do one last thing before we
leave, which is just tussle the room a bit so it

03:06:38.220 --> 03:06:41.792
looks like it's been robbed. Just in case they do
come in.

03:06:41.792 --> 03:06:46.265
MATT: Okay, so you toss the room a bit, muddle up
the space, and you guys, one by one, climb out the

03:06:46.265 --> 03:06:54.000
back of the window, down the rope, and into the
alley behind the inn. Looking about, you're

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:55.771
waiting until about post-midnight, you said?

03:06:55.771 --> 03:06:56.832
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:06:56.832 --> 03:07:02.623
MATT: Okay, so it's dark. The various lanterns
that dangle on the hook poles at different

03:07:02.623 --> 03:07:07.324
intersections of the street are lit. Other than
that, you have a faint bit of moonlight that's

03:07:07.324 --> 03:07:11.046
coming through the sky. There are some clouds, but
they're a bit broken up, so every now and then the

03:07:11.046 --> 03:07:16.345
moon cover can vanish and then return, but for now
you have moonlight in the city. Where are you guys

03:07:16.345 --> 03:07:18.501
going?

03:07:18.501 --> 03:07:20.814
LAURA: Towards the north end.

03:07:20.814 --> 03:07:22.782
TRAVIS: I ought to be leading the way, I reckon.

03:07:22.782 --> 03:07:27.805
SAM: Yeah, I'll go to where I saw the three
cloaked figures.

03:07:27.805 --> 03:07:30.141
MATT: A little ways north of Natural Remedies?
Okay. I would like everybody to make a stealth

03:07:30.141 --> 03:07:32.131
check, please.

03:07:32.194 --> 03:07:34.801
SAM: Stealth check. Do I still have the blessing?
No, I don't.

03:07:34.801 --> 03:07:40.280
LAURA: No, you don't. But I can do it to
everybody, one by one, if we get to an open area.

03:07:40.814 --> 03:07:42.363
SAM: 21.

03:07:42.363 --> 03:07:43.726
TRAVIS: 15.

03:07:43.726 --> 03:07:44.710
MARISHA: 19.

03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:46.450
TALIESIN: 17.

03:07:46.450 --> 03:07:48.784
LAURA: 21.

03:07:48.784 --> 03:07:52.039
LIAM: Forty-- 12.

03:07:52.039 --> 03:07:53.569
SAM: 42.

03:07:53.739 --> 03:07:57.634
MATT: You guys, following Nott, dodge between
alleys, there are a few patrols of the crownsguard

03:07:57.634 --> 03:08:03.684
that you see passing by, and you wait for them to
just cross paths, and then move on. Eventually

03:08:03.684 --> 03:08:08.219
finding your way to Natural Remedies, seemingly
unseen. It's quiet, you can hear the sound of

03:08:08.219 --> 03:08:13.445
crickets in the distance. The cold night air is
causing your breath to show every time you exhale,

03:08:13.445 --> 03:08:19.206
you all bundle your cloaks as you move on. The
moonlight fades a bit, things get darker, but you

03:08:19.206 --> 03:08:25.613
follow Nott's lead, travel from place to place.
You finally get to the outskirts of Natural

03:08:25.613 --> 03:08:30.541
Remedies, and to the northern alleyway where you'd
originally seen those figures pass. You're there.

03:08:30.541 --> 03:08:34.687
SAM: Should we fan out a bit? Cover a couple
corners, so we can still see each other?

03:08:34.687 --> 03:08:35.950
TRAVIS: Good idea.

03:08:35.950 --> 03:08:38.949
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to go with Fjord.

03:08:38.949 --> 03:08:42.549
MARISHA: Let's not spread out too far, though.

03:08:42.549 --> 03:08:44.538
SAM: Are you two like an item?

03:08:45.001 --> 03:08:46.056
LAURA: What?

03:08:46.056 --> 03:08:48.324
SAM: You and Fjord, are you like a thing?

03:08:48.324 --> 03:08:49.998
LAURA: Why, are you interested in him?

03:08:49.998 --> 03:08:51.626
SAM: No, ugh, no!

03:08:51.626 --> 03:08:52.810
LAURA: No?

03:08:52.810 --> 03:08:54.363
SAM: You travel together.

03:08:54.363 --> 03:09:04.084
LAURA: Well yeah, he's a good friend. He watches
out for me, I watch out for him, you know. We're a

03:09:04.084 --> 03:09:08.132
good team. Like you and Caleb.

03:09:08.132 --> 03:09:11.453
SAM: Not at all like that, but yes, all right.

03:09:13.584 --> 03:09:17.602
MATT: As you guys fan out a little bit, everyone
make a perception check.

03:09:21.019 --> 03:09:22.862
LAURA: Natural one.

03:09:24.612 --> 03:09:26.912
SAM: 19.

03:09:27.804 --> 03:09:29.410
LAURA: I don't see shit.

03:09:29.410 --> 03:09:30.386
MARISHA: Perception?

03:09:30.386 --> 03:09:31.688
TALIESIN: 12.

03:09:31.688 --> 03:09:32.842
TRAVIS: Nine.

03:09:32.842 --> 03:09:34.201
MARISHA: 18.

03:09:34.201 --> 03:09:35.466
LIAM: Ten.

03:09:35.466 --> 03:09:38.915
MATT: Okay, so all of you, except for Jester,
manage to get a clear view of your vicinity.

03:09:38.915 --> 03:09:44.191
Jester, you somehow get an eyelash caught in your
eye and spend the next hour trying to get it out,

03:09:44.191 --> 03:09:46.587
but it's in the eyelid.

03:09:46.587 --> 03:09:48.309
LAURA: Fjord, can you see it?

03:09:48.309 --> 03:09:50.664
TRAVIS: Look up. Yeah.

03:09:50.722 --> 03:09:52.695
MARISHA: To the left.

03:09:52.695 --> 03:09:54.541
TRAVIS: Let me get it--

03:09:54.541 --> 03:09:58.554
LAURA: No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay.

03:09:59.039 --> 03:10:01.505
MATT: Occasionally, you can hear the crownsguard
approaching, and they carry their torches with

03:10:01.505 --> 03:10:05.570
them. You can see the light crawling forward, so
you all duck out of the way and let them pass.

03:10:05.570 --> 03:10:15.700
About an hour passes. Two hours pass. Around the
third hour, you get the sensation that whatever

03:10:15.700 --> 03:10:21.638
you saw the other night is not arriving on a
clockwork time or not arriving at all. It's about

03:10:21.638 --> 03:10:26.153
three in the morning, in the center of the city by
yourself. What do you wish to do?

03:10:26.153 --> 03:10:27.197
MARISHA: Three in the morning?

03:10:27.197 --> 03:10:29.339
MATT: Yeah.

03:10:29.339 --> 03:10:35.225
MARISHA: I turn to Caleb. Any tingling from your
alarm system?

03:10:35.225 --> 03:10:37.799
LIAM: No, I wouldn't have brought it up if
something had happened.

03:10:37.799 --> 03:10:40.651
MARISHA: That's a good point.

03:10:40.651 --> 03:10:50.176
TALIESIN: I'm just going to try to meditate on the
strange death and see if I can feel anything.

03:10:50.176 --> 03:10:51.800
MATT: Okay.

03:10:56.025 --> 03:10:57.808
Make an intelligence check.

03:10:57.808 --> 03:11:00.012
TALIESIN: All right. Just see how this goes.

03:11:00.303 --> 03:11:01.800
SAM: Mediation check.

03:11:02.338 --> 03:11:04.727
TALIESIN: 17.

03:11:04.727 --> 03:11:09.584
MATT: Pouring over the details of what has
transpired and what you guys have done so far to

03:11:09.584 --> 03:11:18.019
find information, there are still things to
inquire about. There are still things to wonder

03:11:18.019 --> 03:11:21.614
and discover and there are a few places you
haven't been to. A few places you haven't returned

03:11:21.614 --> 03:11:29.175
to. A few people you haven't even inquired about
closer to the investigation.

03:11:29.175 --> 03:11:31.308
LAURA: Oh, we should talk to the girl.

03:11:31.308 --> 03:11:32.703
SAM: Toya?

03:11:32.703 --> 03:11:33.995
LAURA: Yeah.

03:11:33.995 --> 03:11:36.371
SAM: Let's go wake her ass up.

03:11:36.371 --> 03:11:38.592
MARISHA: Is she under arrest? We don't know.

03:11:38.592 --> 03:11:40.491
TALIESIN: Maybe we have to go back to the circus.

03:11:40.491 --> 03:11:42.358
LAURA: Maybe it was Yasha.

03:11:42.358 --> 03:11:43.957
TALIESIN: It's early enough maybe we should
just--

03:11:43.957 --> 03:11:46.181
TRAVIS: We have a few more hours and the cover of
darkness.

03:11:46.181 --> 03:11:48.529
SAM: Yeah, let's go wake her ass up.

03:11:48.529 --> 03:11:53.177
MARISHA: Maybe we should go back to the circus.
Scene of the crime? That whole thing?

03:11:53.840 --> 03:11:58.832
TALIESIN: I hate to admit it, but maybe-- it's not
us.

03:11:58.832 --> 03:12:01.401
TRAVIS: Who's &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; stealthy?

03:12:01.401 --> 03:12:03.546
MARISHA: I'm all right.

03:12:03.546 --> 03:12:08.359
TRAVIS: Maybe we don't &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; need to go. Maybe
just a few, and the others will hang back.

03:12:08.359 --> 03:12:12.523
SAM: Hang back close by though, right? If
something goes bad--

03:12:12.523 --> 03:12:20.830
MARISHA: Or if you see something. How far are we
from the inn?

03:12:20.830 --> 03:12:27.053
MATT: From the inn? About a 15 minute jog.

03:12:27.053 --> 03:12:29.037
SAM: So we can go to the circus?

03:12:29.037 --> 03:12:30.819
TRAVIS: An hour and a half.

03:12:30.819 --> 03:12:33.677
LAURA: While we're still trying to figure this
out, I'm going to take out my painter's kit and

03:12:33.677 --> 03:12:39.790
draw like a little piece of poop on the side of
the building that we're next to.

03:12:39.815 --> 03:12:41.445
SAM: Tagging? That's good.

03:12:41.445 --> 03:12:42.961
MARISHA: A little tagger.

03:12:42.961 --> 03:12:44.619
TRAVIS: Is it like a mound of poop or like a
single--?

03:12:44.619 --> 03:12:46.291
LAURA: No it's like a mound of poop.

03:12:46.291 --> 03:12:47.590
TALIESIN: It's like an emoji.

03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:49.560
MATT: Make a performance check.

03:12:52.693 --> 03:12:56.035
LAURA: Oh I rolled really low on this one. Four!

03:12:56.035 --> 03:13:02.984
MATT: It takes a little convincing to have them
see the poop in the drawing. You can see it, but

03:13:02.984 --> 03:13:04.410
you've seen better.

03:13:04.410 --> 03:13:06.110
TRAVIS: Is it a worm? It's a snake.

03:13:06.110 --> 03:13:08.239
LAURA: It's poop, I should've--

03:13:08.239 --> 03:13:10.216
LIAM: That's an &lt;i&gt;oval&lt;/i&gt;.

03:13:10.386 --> 03:13:14.993
LAURA: I should have drawn a &lt;i&gt;pile&lt;/i&gt; of poop. I
draw a pile of poop next to it.

03:13:14.993 --> 03:13:16.713
MATT: It helps, but--

03:13:16.713 --> 03:13:18.482
LIAM: That's a triangle.

03:13:18.482 --> 03:13:20.567
TRAVIS: Yeah, I thought it was like chocolate
frozen yogurt.

03:13:20.567 --> 03:13:22.161
TALIESIN: Is math or something?

03:13:22.161 --> 03:13:27.895
LAURA: It's dark okay?! I can usually paint much
better than this. It's really dark and my hands

03:13:27.895 --> 03:13:30.314
feel a little numb.

03:13:31.094 --> 03:13:32.959
SAM: Let's move then.

03:13:32.959 --> 03:13:35.686
MATT: Who's going where? What are you guys doing?

03:13:35.686 --> 03:13:37.421
ALL: We're all going to the circus.

03:13:37.421 --> 03:13:38.948
TRAVIS: &lt;i&gt;Stealthily&lt;/i&gt; to the circus.

03:13:38.948 --> 03:13:40.990
MATT: All right, I would like for all of you to
roll a stealth check.

03:13:40.990 --> 03:13:42.548
MARISHA: Is no one staying behind or--?

03:13:42.548 --> 03:13:43.603
LAURA: Fuck it!

03:13:43.603 --> 03:13:45.032
SAM: Some are staying &lt;i&gt;away&lt;/i&gt; from the tent.

03:13:45.032 --> 03:13:47.922
TRAVIS: Yeah, going in danger close.

03:13:47.922 --> 03:13:48.914
SAM: 13.

03:13:48.914 --> 03:13:50.257
TRAVIS: Nine.

03:13:50.257 --> 03:13:51.341
MARISHA: Oh not great. Nine!

03:13:51.341 --> 03:13:52.364
TALIESIN: Seven.

03:13:52.364 --> 03:13:53.274
LAURA: 19.

03:13:53.274 --> 03:13:54.522
LIAM: 15.

03:13:54.522 --> 03:13:56.174
SAM: 13.

03:13:56.174 --> 03:14:04.625
MATT: Okay, you guys make your way through most of
the Docksward on your way to the large blue tent

03:14:04.625 --> 03:14:08.649
that still stands ominously in the distance.
Thankfully, the moon has come out and cast this

03:14:08.649 --> 03:14:13.116
rimlight against the structure, so it's easy to
see. As you guys are making your way outside of

03:14:13.116 --> 03:14:21.162
the Lochward, you immediately see the approaching
torchlight of crownsguard. One of them you just

03:14:21.162 --> 03:14:27.344
faintly hear 40 or 50 feet ahead of you, "Who goes
there?"

03:14:27.344 --> 03:14:29.672
LAURA: Oh shit.

03:14:29.672 --> 03:14:31.179
SAM: Is there only one guard?

03:14:31.179 --> 03:14:34.638
MATT: It's two guards, side by side. These watches,
they patrol in pairs.

03:14:34.822 --> 03:14:36.638
MARISHA: Are we in like an alleyway, or in the
street?

03:14:36.638 --> 03:14:40.053
MATT: You guys are keeping off to the side. You're
all on the outskirts of the lake and almost made

03:14:40.053 --> 03:14:42.808
your way out of the city towards where the--

03:14:42.808 --> 03:14:44.778
LAURA: Go in the lake. Quick, go into the lake!

03:14:44.778 --> 03:14:47.953
TRAVIS: I cast Disguise Self, and I turn myself
into a crownsguard.

03:14:47.953 --> 03:14:50.669
LIAM: Disguise Self and follow suit.

03:14:50.669 --> 03:14:51.713
MATT: You do as well?

03:14:51.713 --> 03:14:52.576
LIAM: Yeah.

03:14:52.576 --> 03:14:58.483
MATT: All right. So you both become crownsguard.
You've all of a sudden are adorned in the goldish

03:14:58.483 --> 03:15:02.932
brass and red armor.

03:15:03.493 --> 03:15:06.947
TALIESIN: I'm in my black hood. I've got my hood
up now.

03:15:06.947 --> 03:15:08.523
SAM: Anywhere to hide?

03:15:08.523 --> 03:15:13.698
MATT: There are some small alcoves, but you guys
are out in the open, now. They've seen you.

03:15:13.698 --> 03:15:16.101
MARISHA: &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of us?

03:15:16.101 --> 03:15:20.256
MATT: You don't know. They've seen &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. They've
called &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; you, and then both of you guys

03:15:20.256 --> 03:15:23.135
disguised yourselves. What are you doing?

03:15:23.135 --> 03:15:26.390
LAURA: I walk into the lake and crouch down?

03:15:27.284 --> 03:15:34.558
MATT: Jester walks up and wades in about six
inches of water and just-- gives her best duck

03:15:34.558 --> 03:15:35.994
impression.

03:15:35.994 --> 03:15:46.885
SAM: I will take off my mask and start attacking
Caleb in a convincing fashion. Not to draw blood

03:15:46.885 --> 03:15:48.105
but-- yeah.

03:15:48.105 --> 03:15:49.489
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:15:49.489 --> 03:15:50.556
SAM: Deception check?

03:15:50.556 --> 03:15:51.682
MATT: Yes.

03:15:51.682 --> 03:15:53.817
SAM: Oh.

03:15:53.817 --> 03:15:59.075
LIAM: Can I start going (groans) Oh get off, you
little beast! To help with the illusion?

03:15:59.075 --> 03:16:01.533
SAM: (snarling noises)

03:16:01.533 --> 03:16:03.484
MATT: Sure, make a deception check.

03:16:03.484 --> 03:16:05.864
SAM: Oh, my deception check was a three minus
three.

03:16:05.864 --> 03:16:07.378
LIAM: But roll with advantage.

03:16:07.378 --> 03:16:08.692
SAM: At advantage?

03:16:08.692 --> 03:16:10.305
LIAM: I'm helping you, you little--

03:16:10.305 --> 03:16:11.761
SAM: Seven minus three!

03:16:11.761 --> 03:16:13.559
LIAM: Oh no!

03:16:13.559 --> 03:16:20.440
MATT: Okay so as soon as these two crownsguard see
this, they go "Shit!" They pull their blades and

03:16:20.440 --> 03:16:25.431
they start charging you, Nott, to try and protect
their other crownsguard--

03:16:25.617 --> 03:16:31.957
LIAM: I take Nott and slam her into a wall as hard
as I can and say: Down you beast!

03:16:31.957 --> 03:16:37.301
MATT: All right, as you rush up in a jog, blades
drawn, one of them is going to go ahead and

03:16:37.301 --> 03:16:38.425
attempt to strike.

03:16:38.425 --> 03:16:41.382
SAM: Oh god! Sure.

03:16:43.101 --> 03:16:45.167
MATT: That is going to be a 14 to hit.

03:16:45.167 --> 03:16:46.341
SAM: Miss!

03:16:46.341 --> 03:16:52.512
MATT: So you manage to (squeaks) and narrowly
dodge the blade as it strikes through the back of

03:16:52.512 --> 03:16:58.432
your cloak and pins it to the side of a wooden
pole that is on the outside of an overhang where

03:16:58.432 --> 03:17:03.506
some of the fish are being left out to dry and
turn into fish jerky. It holds you in place as

03:17:03.506 --> 03:17:07.268
you're snarling and looking scared. The other one
pulls out his blade and says "Where did this thing

03:17:07.268 --> 03:17:08.592
"come from!?"

03:17:08.592 --> 03:17:10.013
LIAM: I have it! And I punch Nott right in the
face.

03:17:10.013 --> 03:17:11.921
SAM: Oh!

03:17:11.921 --> 03:17:16.827
MATT: All right, you take one point of bludgeoning
damage, Nott, and blood just (flowing noise) from

03:17:16.827 --> 03:17:18.106
the nose.

03:17:18.106 --> 03:17:21.277
LIAM: I have this. We're taking these people across
to jail.

03:17:21.502 --> 03:17:25.535
TRAVIS: (Regal voice) Indeed, stay our blade,
please, obviously he can handle this.

03:17:25.535 --> 03:17:28.034
LIAM: Don't you fucking move you little green
piece of filth.

03:17:28.034 --> 03:17:30.696
SAM: (spits)

03:17:30.696 --> 03:17:36.616
TRAVIS: Right in your face! Haha, incredible.

03:17:36.616 --> 03:17:42.620
LIAM: This one is mine, thank you. Beat her within
an inch of her life.

03:17:42.620 --> 03:17:45.543
MATT: I need you to make a deception check on that
one.

03:17:45.543 --> 03:17:49.461
TALIESIN: We are just the worst. This is just
terrible.

03:17:49.461 --> 03:17:50.947
MARISHA: Oh man.

03:17:50.947 --> 03:17:52.051
LIAM: Natural 20.

03:17:52.051 --> 03:17:54.706
(cheering)

03:17:54.706 --> 03:17:59.391
SAM: We've practiced this before. We got this
routine down.

03:17:59.391 --> 03:18:04.980
MATT: You see a look of disappointment come across
the two crownsguards' faces in their inability to

03:18:04.980 --> 03:18:12.136
help you skewer this small, feral creature. They
both put their blades away. "All right if you see

03:18:12.136 --> 03:18:16.254
"anything else, give a shout. (spits)"

03:18:16.254 --> 03:18:17.833
SAM: Ugh.

03:18:17.833 --> 03:18:19.971
MATT: They both continue their walk past the rest
of you.

03:18:19.971 --> 03:18:24.614
LIAM: The rest of you lot fall in line. I drag the
little one off.

03:18:24.614 --> 03:18:27.565
SAM: (snivels)

03:18:27.565 --> 03:18:33.225
MATT: They look over at the tiefling-- partially
crouched in the water.

03:18:33.225 --> 03:18:35.193
SAM: She's taking a shit.

03:18:35.193 --> 03:18:37.284
LAURA: I really had to pee!

03:18:37.284 --> 03:18:40.247
MATT: "Hey! Not in the Ustaloch!"

03:18:40.247 --> 03:18:44.093
(laughter)

03:18:45.557 --> 03:18:59.810
LAURA: Okay. Oh okay. I get out. I stand up and
slowly dredge out of the water.

03:18:59.810 --> 03:19:07.967
MATT: Your legs are soaked from thigh to foot, and
they both eye you warily and slowly walk past.

03:19:07.967 --> 03:19:10.408
LAURA: (sigh of relief)

03:19:10.408 --> 03:19:12.613
MARISHA: It's real cold out.

03:19:12.613 --> 03:19:15.227
LIAM: Have they cleared the way?

03:19:15.227 --> 03:19:21.162
MATT: Eventually, they pass beyond a point where
you feel absolute dread of their presence.

03:19:21.162 --> 03:19:25.129
TRAVIS: Is that a natural thing for you guys to
just attack each other in moments of stress?

03:19:25.129 --> 03:19:27.219
LIAM: Are you all right? I am so very sorry, I'm
so sorry--

03:19:27.219 --> 03:19:32.386
SAM: No, I'm fine that was good acting. You were
perfect. I panicked, I didn't know what to do. I

03:19:32.386 --> 03:19:34.537
was trying to create some sort of distraction.

03:19:34.537 --> 03:19:38.180
LIAM: Let me see your teeth. Okay. You look all
right.

03:19:38.180 --> 03:19:40.232
SAM: They're all over the place.

03:19:40.232 --> 03:19:45.420
(laughter)

03:19:45.420 --> 03:19:48.873
TRAVIS: Oh, I can't tell if that got worse or
better.

03:19:48.873 --> 03:19:52.144
MARISHA: You fixed them a bit!

03:19:52.745 --> 03:19:56.142
LIAM: Okay. Who wants to go to the circus?

03:19:56.142 --> 03:19:58.925
MARISHA: Yay.

03:19:58.925 --> 03:20:02.268
MATT: All right, you guys are make the rest of the
path to the outskirts of the circus. You see at

03:20:02.268 --> 03:20:09.307
the very front flap of it you see a crownsguard
who's like (yawn) sitting there, his arms crossed

03:20:09.307 --> 03:20:13.966
to the front keeping an eye out, he is doing
late-shift. You do see the faint distant

03:20:13.966 --> 03:20:19.730
flickering glow of firelight from the back side of
the circus.

03:20:19.730 --> 03:20:23.733
MARISHA: What is that? Do you guys have like a
nightlight?

03:20:23.733 --> 03:20:25.396
TALIESIN: It's where we camp.

03:20:25.396 --> 03:20:26.925
MATT: Yeah, you saw it earlier, you saw the
campfire.

03:20:26.925 --> 03:20:28.243
MARISHA: Oh sure.

03:20:28.243 --> 03:20:32.128
TRAVIS: If you want to make your ways around, I
could distract them for a moment, have a

03:20:32.128 --> 03:20:33.349
conversation with them.

03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:34.850
MARISHA: Do they still look like crownsguard?

03:20:34.850 --> 03:20:35.883
MATT: Yes.

03:20:35.883 --> 03:20:37.231
TRAVIS: For an hour.

03:20:37.231 --> 03:20:38.982
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

03:20:38.982 --> 03:20:42.343
LIAM: You you want to go with them? I'll go with
him.

03:20:42.343 --> 03:20:47.886
SAM: Sure, but will you be watching me or no? You
don't have to.

03:20:48.271 --> 03:20:49.824
LIAM: Frumpkin will go with you.

03:20:49.824 --> 03:20:56.049
SAM: All right. I'll go with you and-- who else is
going? Are you stealthy?

03:20:56.249 --> 03:20:59.452
LAURA: We'll take care of you. Don't worry!

03:20:59.452 --> 03:21:02.005
TALIESIN: They're not going to talk to you without
&lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, so I'm coming, too.

03:21:02.005 --> 03:21:04.300
LIAM: I'm a little jittery, do you want to be a
front man for a little while?

03:21:04.300 --> 03:21:05.429
TRAVIS: Sure I got it, yeah.

03:21:05.429 --> 03:21:06.978
LIAM: Okay.

03:21:06.978 --> 03:21:09.035
MATT: All right, so what are the groups here?

03:21:09.035 --> 03:21:10.553
SAM: The girls and the boys.

03:21:10.553 --> 03:21:11.883
TRAVIS: Caleb and me--

03:21:11.883 --> 03:21:13.104
LAURA: And Molly.

03:21:13.104 --> 03:21:14.788
SAM: And whatever Molly is.

03:21:14.788 --> 03:21:15.965
(laughter)

03:21:15.965 --> 03:21:17.534
TALIESIN: I'm fabulous.

03:21:17.534 --> 03:21:19.201
MATT: Molly, who are you going with?

03:21:19.201 --> 03:21:22.690
TALIESIN: I'm going with the girls, because the
circus kids won't talk to them without me.

03:21:22.690 --> 03:21:26.845
MATT: All right, so the three of you are going
forward. What are you doing? I guess I should

03:21:26.845 --> 03:21:27.764
ask.

03:21:27.764 --> 03:21:32.729
TRAVIS: I walk up to the guard. (regal voice) It's
a late night, not much action this evening. See

03:21:32.933 --> 03:21:35.147
anything unusual?

03:21:35.147 --> 03:21:42.115
MATT: "Eh, nothing yet. Mostly I hate this. Ugh, I
just wish this whole fucking circus would just go.

03:21:42.115 --> 03:21:44.340
"I need to sleep. Regular hours."

03:21:44.340 --> 03:21:46.305
TRAVIS: Yeah, have you heard heard? 
How long are they supposed to be here?

03:21:46.324 --> 03:21:50.363
MATT: "Until they finish this fucking
investigation. They keep bugging people for

03:21:50.363 --> 03:21:54.262
"information, but they're all just clammed up and
not saying shit."

03:21:54.262 --> 03:21:56.406
TRAVIS: At least you're by the tent, they've had
us walking the perimeter of the lake the entire

03:21:56.406 --> 03:21:57.499
time.

03:21:57.499 --> 03:22:04.170
MATT: "It's bullshit. I wish they would just go
ahead and execute them. That carnival master or

03:22:04.170 --> 03:22:05.917
whatever and get it over with."

03:22:05.917 --> 03:22:09.476
TRAVIS: Did they find anything inside, today? Tell
me, &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; interesting, please.

03:22:09.476 --> 03:22:13.223
MATT: "They investigated the corpses and found
nothing yet. Still in there if you want to take a

03:22:13.223 --> 03:22:14.637
look at it."

03:22:14.637 --> 03:22:17.075
TRAVIS: Would you mind if we popped in?

03:22:17.075 --> 03:22:19.797
MATT: "I mean I suppose so." Make a deception
check.

03:22:22.947 --> 03:22:25.964
MARISHA: Something good, something good?

03:22:26.072 --> 03:22:27.616
TALIESIN: No.

03:22:27.616 --> 03:22:29.595
TRAVIS: Where is it? Jesus.

03:22:31.228 --> 03:22:32.700
Oh! 13.

03:22:32.700 --> 03:22:38.585
MATT: Okay. He thinks a second on it. "Oh I
suppose so. Go on in."

03:22:41.175 --> 03:22:43.614
TRAVIS: We'll be quick, super fast.

03:22:43.791 --> 03:22:51.711
MATT: "Please, get it over with." He stops you.
"If there's any way to expedite this, if you can

03:22:51.711 --> 03:22:55.834
"pin it on any of them, we can just kill them and
take care of it. Let me know."

03:22:56.701 --> 03:22:58.100
TRAVIS: Let's go.

03:22:59.514 --> 03:23:04.495
(as Grog) That worked way better
than I thought. Like we should-- I mean--

03:23:04.495 --> 03:23:07.433
(as Fjord) should we look around for stuff or what?

03:23:07.433 --> 03:23:10.215
(laughter)

03:23:10.390 --> 03:23:12.611
SAM: Yes. Yes.

03:23:12.611 --> 03:23:16.465
LIAM: You are very good with voices.

03:23:16.465 --> 03:23:19.781
TRAVIS: Well you know, I do a little mimicry here
and there. We should look, come on. Check the

03:23:19.781 --> 03:23:22.632
grounds. Maybe we can find where the bodies are
laying.

03:23:22.710 --> 03:23:24.520
LIAM: Yeah, let's have a look around.

03:23:24.520 --> 03:23:27.758
MATT: You guys look inside, the tent is dark.
There's no light inside.

03:23:31.028 --> 03:23:41.144
LIAM: I take a rag out of my side satchel and I
cast-- what the hell is it called because I've

03:23:41.196 --> 03:23:46.388
only been a wizard for a short time-- one Dancing
Light underneath the rags so it's only dim.

03:23:46.388 --> 03:23:52.367
MATT: All right, so you have this self-made hooded
lantern with the hood you have over it.

03:23:52.367 --> 03:23:53.132
LIAM: Yeah.

03:23:53.132 --> 03:23:54.715
MATT: Okay.

03:23:54.715 --> 03:23:56.857
MARISHA: That's dope.

03:23:56.857 --> 03:23:59.167
LIAM: What the fuck are we looking for in here?

03:23:59.167 --> 03:24:00.655
MATT: And Nott, you're going with them?

03:24:00.655 --> 03:24:02.027
SAM: I'm with the girls.

03:24:02.027 --> 03:24:03.961
TRAVS: Where did the bodies fall? Over there,
didn't they?

03:24:03.961 --> 03:24:05.322
LIAM: That's right, yeah.

03:24:05.322 --> 03:24:07.221
TRAVIS: Well let's search the grounds.

03:24:07.221 --> 03:24:09.963
MATT: You make your way inside, the smell is
pretty bad. You can smell the flesh beginning to

03:24:10.155 --> 03:24:11.283
decay.

03:24:11.283 --> 03:24:13.280
TRAVIS: Have they moved the bodies or are the
bodies still there?

03:24:13.280 --> 03:24:18.364
MATT: With a bit of looking, the bodies are still
there where they left them. They have not moved,

03:24:18.364 --> 03:24:23.679
you can see a couple of remnants of notes and
sheets that have been crumpled, but the bodies

03:24:23.679 --> 03:24:27.015
have been left where they are.

03:24:27.015 --> 03:24:34.842
TRAVIS: Can we check the bodies for anything?

03:24:34.842 --> 03:24:43.862
LIAM: Is there anything arcane? From all my
studies, does anything here ring any bell? I have

03:24:43.862 --> 03:24:45.461
a photographic memory.

03:24:45.476 --> 03:24:48.015
MATT: Go and make a religion check.

03:24:50.114 --> 03:24:54.974
LIAM: All right. That is a ten.

03:24:54.974 --> 03:24:59.451
MATT: Unfortunately, you don't have a lot of
research on the undead, or whatever might be the

03:24:59.451 --> 03:25:03.882
essence of this creature's creation, and the more
you look at it, you're like, "This is not my

03:25:03.882 --> 03:25:05.442
specialty."

03:25:05.442 --> 03:25:09.500
LIAM: Okay. What about the perimeters of here,
where all the people were? There was a swarm of

03:25:09.500 --> 03:25:13.108
people. I spend five minutes seeing anything was
dropped of interest.

03:25:13.108 --> 03:25:16.599
MATT: Make an investigation check, both of you.

03:25:16.599 --> 03:25:18.878
TRAVIS: That's better.

03:25:18.878 --> 03:25:20.482
LIAM: I miss the twins.

03:25:20.482 --> 03:25:21.794
TRAVIS: 16.

03:25:21.794 --> 03:25:23.441
LIAM: Big ten.

03:25:23.441 --> 03:25:28.037
MATT: Glancing about, you can see the track marks
of everyone fleeing. You can see the spatters of

03:25:28.037 --> 03:25:34.886
blood. You can see the place where the
transformation occurred. There is a horrible

03:25:34.886 --> 03:25:44.202
shedding of certain layers of flesh. You can see
previously existing layers of flesh and muscle

03:25:44.202 --> 03:25:54.210
that were shed as whatever this undead thing was
fell to the ground. Once again, you make a

03:25:54.457 --> 03:25:57.669
religion check as well.

03:25:58.915 --> 03:26:01.660
TRAVIS: Okay. Roll high. I did not. Ten.

03:26:01.660 --> 03:26:07.344
MATT: Yeah. This is not your specialty. You have
little experience with the undead and this type of

03:26:07.344 --> 03:26:08.247
magic.

03:26:08.247 --> 03:26:11.448
TRAVIS: We can't spend that long in here. Maybe we
just take a bit of it with us. Do you have a

03:26:11.448 --> 03:26:13.619
pocket?

03:26:13.619 --> 03:26:16.261
LIAM: I have many pockets, of course I have
pockets.

03:26:16.261 --> 03:26:19.695
TRAVIS: Like a jar? I-I got no pockets!

03:26:19.695 --> 03:26:24.392
SAM: You designed a character with no pockets?!
Why would you do that?

03:26:24.495 --> 03:26:27.744
TRAVIS: There's no pockets! All right, but I'll
check.

03:26:27.744 --> 03:26:30.917
LIAM: He's just in the Blue Man Group unitard and
that's it.

03:26:30.917 --> 03:26:34.544
MARISHA: I'm sure Rob Liefeld just got a nosebleed
and he doesn't know why.

03:26:34.544 --> 03:26:40.791
LIAM: So this dead thing is here in front of me?

03:26:41.002 --> 03:26:44.661
MATT: Two of them. There's the main one, the
ground zero one, which is where you were putting

03:26:44.661 --> 03:26:47.753
all your attention, and then there's the woman,
who was transformed as part of the first.

03:26:47.753 --> 03:26:55.251
LIAM: I will take my dagger, and I will slice a
little bit off of the woman, and it's going to get

03:26:55.251 --> 03:27:01.721
dark in here and I will snuff out the light and
use the rag to roll it up and I'll put the little

03:27:01.721 --> 03:27:03.846
piece in my pack.

03:27:03.846 --> 03:27:10.728
MATT: With a squishy sound you place it within
your pack.

03:27:10.728 --> 03:27:12.321
LIAM: Let's get out of here, I'm going to be
sick.

03:27:12.321 --> 03:27:13.436
TRAVIS: Agreed.

03:27:13.436 --> 03:27:18.159
MATT: All right. The four of you, I need you to
roll stealth checks, please.

03:27:20.697 --> 03:27:26.113
MARISHA: Not that one. I don't feel good about it.
Oh not bad! 21.

03:27:26.113 --> 03:27:27.232
TALIESIN: 17.

03:27:27.232 --> 03:27:28.429
LAURA: 18.

03:27:28.429 --> 03:27:29.907
SAM: 25.

03:27:29.907 --> 03:27:35.200
MATT: Without issue, you guys quickly dart around
the side of the tent and make your way right

03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:40.763
towards the central area where the multitude of
tents to this back encampment is placed. There is

03:27:40.763 --> 03:27:47.970
a single campfire. The embers are burning out. It
has not been kept up. You do see two crownsguard

03:27:47.970 --> 03:27:51.896
who are currently keeping watch. One of them is
slumped in a chair across from the fire and is

03:27:51.896 --> 03:27:59.171
nodding off. The other is doing a basic patrol and
looking around. Other than that, you don't hear

03:27:59.171 --> 03:28:04.719
any sounds, you don't see anybody else. Just the
two crownsguard.

03:28:06.385 --> 03:28:10.669
TALIESIN: Which of the tents is currently
occupied?

03:28:10.669 --> 03:28:16.843
MATT: There are four main tents. There are two
very large ones, one of which generally contains

03:28:16.843 --> 03:28:24.027
Toya and Kylre, the devil toad. That's on the
south side. There's the north largest tent, this

03:28:24.027 --> 03:28:32.508
one contains the Knot sisters and Ornna. Then
there's a very small tent to the south side that

03:28:32.508 --> 03:28:40.380
would be Bo the Breaker's tent, but he's not here.
Then there's a medium sized tent on the north

03:28:40.380 --> 03:28:45.722
side. Who would be in that one?

03:28:49.002 --> 03:28:55.462
TALIESIN: Toya and Kylre share a tent, that's
right. It would be Desmond.

03:28:55.669 --> 03:28:59.526
MATT: Desmond would be the other one. It would be
Gustav staying there as well, but Gustav changes

03:28:59.526 --> 03:29:02.326
between the tent and the cart.

03:29:02.326 --> 03:29:04.063
MARISHA: The cart?

03:29:04.063 --> 03:29:05.827
TALIESIN: We have a wagon.

03:29:05.827 --> 03:29:10.929
LAURA: Molly, I have a question. What made you
guys set up your tent here?

03:29:10.929 --> 03:29:13.755
TALIESIN: We were told to set it up here, if I
recall.

03:29:13.755 --> 03:29:18.020
LAURA: In this specific area?

03:29:18.020 --> 03:29:21.981
TALIESIN: That sounds right. If I recall, we were
specifically told to set up tent right here.

03:29:21.981 --> 03:29:24.294
MARISHA: And it's by the lake, right?

03:29:24.294 --> 03:29:28.160
MATT: Maybe 150-200 feet away from it.

03:29:28.160 --> 03:29:30.688
MARISHA: That's pretty close to a lake.

03:29:30.688 --> 03:29:36.391
LAURA: What if they set up their tent on a cursed
land or something?

03:29:36.391 --> 03:29:41.594
MARISHA: It's the lake, it's common?

03:29:41.594 --> 03:29:46.229
TALIESIN: What's the easiest tent to get to
without--

03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:49.007
MATT: Do you want to go to the north side or the
south side of the main tent?

03:29:49.007 --> 03:29:51.053
TALIESIN: I want to go with whatever's furthest
away from the guards.

03:29:51.053 --> 03:29:53.387
SAM: Shouldn't we just go to the Toya tent?

03:29:53.387 --> 03:29:56.029
MATT: The Toya tent's on the south side, that's
the opposite side, you guys would have probably

03:29:56.029 --> 03:29:57.475
come in from the north end.

03:29:57.475 --> 03:29:59.046
TALIESIN: What's the easiest to get to without--

03:29:59.046 --> 03:30:03.251
MATT: That would be the one that contains Ornna
and the Knot sisters.

03:30:03.251 --> 03:30:09.786
TALIESIN: I'm going to go back there and do our
traditional (bird call)

03:30:09.786 --> 03:30:15.483
MATT: Okay. There's actually no response.

03:30:15.483 --> 03:30:18.556
LAURA: (bird call)

03:30:21.505 --> 03:30:27.216
MARISHA: I had Mona and Lena, but maybe it's
Lolie.

03:30:27.216 --> 03:30:35.940
TALIESIN: Yuli. It's Mona and Yuli. I'm going to
try one of the other tents. Am I getting the sense

03:30:35.940 --> 03:30:40.215
that any of them are in?

03:30:40.215 --> 03:30:41.495
SAM: Look over here!

03:30:41.495 --> 03:30:43.144
TALIESIN: Over here!

03:30:43.144 --> 03:30:46.454
MATT: The other tent you get to and you make the
same sound? This would be the one that Desmond

03:30:46.454 --> 03:30:52.246
usually is in, too. There's a pause, and then you
hear a very faint (bird call).

03:30:52.246 --> 03:30:58.176
TALIESIN: I'm going to very gently lift the back
of the tent up and not go in through the front.

03:30:58.176 --> 03:30:59.540
And just--

03:30:59.540 --> 03:31:04.915
MATT: Okay. You glance inside and you can see,
leaning up from a bedroll, Desmond who is

03:31:04.915 --> 03:31:13.570
half-awake, and glances over and sees you. He's
out of outfit, out of makeup, and he gives a nod.

03:31:13.570 --> 03:31:19.409
TALIESIN: (whispering) Do you know what's going
on? (switches to normal volume) Assume we're

03:31:19.409 --> 03:31:20.722
whispering, because this is bullshit.

03:31:20.722 --> 03:31:22.673
MATT: Yeah.

03:31:22.673 --> 03:31:25.850
TALIESIN: How is it? What's happened?

03:31:25.850 --> 03:31:31.858
MATT: "They've come around asking a few questions,
we're trying to figure it out ourselves. Are you

03:31:31.858 --> 03:31:32.862
"okay?"

03:31:32.862 --> 03:31:35.033
TALIESIN: I could be worse.

03:31:35.033 --> 03:31:37.475
MATT: "How's Gustav? And Bosun?"

03:31:37.475 --> 03:31:51.531
TALIESIN: They couldn't be worse. And then Yasha
Yasha'd. I don't know. Did Toya see anything? Did

03:31:51.531 --> 03:31:55.616
she say anything?

03:31:55.616 --> 03:32:02.263
MATT: "We're still trying to figure this out
ourselves. Are you alone?"

03:32:02.263 --> 03:32:06.495
TALIESIN: No, I've picked up a few scragglers.
They're idiots, but they're helping.

03:32:06.495 --> 03:32:08.312
MATT: "Well bring them in."

03:32:08.312 --> 03:32:10.855
SAM: We come in.

03:32:10.855 --> 03:32:14.577
MATT: You guys all enter the tent and you see
Desmond. Previously you saw him in this very

03:32:14.587 --> 03:32:20.097
colorful outfit with the frilled neck piece and
the full facial makeup. Now you see a man in his

03:32:20.145 --> 03:32:25.108
late 30s with a very scarred left side of his
face. It looks like it was shredded at one point

03:32:25.108 --> 03:32:31.474
in his youth, that the makeup hid during the
performance. As soon as you enter, even upon

03:32:31.474 --> 03:32:41.845
greeting him, he has a very sad presence to him.
Even though you're all under the cover of night

03:32:41.845 --> 03:32:49.310
and having this conspiratorial conversation, he
has this melancholy about him that permeates the

03:32:49.310 --> 03:32:58.396
space inside the tent. He says, "So you're all the
ones that helped earlier. Thank you. It would have

03:32:58.396 --> 03:33:00.655
"been far worse if you hadn't."

03:33:00.655 --> 03:33:03.528
LAURA: No problem.

03:33:03.528 --> 03:33:06.160
TALIESIN: What do they think happened? What are
they asking?

03:33:06.160 --> 03:33:11.953
MATT: "They're thinking something about the show.
They're thinking Gustav made this happen. I don't

03:33:11.953 --> 03:33:19.786
think it's Gustav, he's a good man. He makes poor
choices and it's plagued him his whole life, you

03:33:19.786 --> 03:33:29.579
can see it in his brow. But good intentions have
grave consequences. No one that good comes out of

03:33:29.579 --> 03:33:36.020
Shady Creek Run without some mistakes behind them,
but I don't see him doing this."

03:33:36.020 --> 03:33:38.213
TALIESIN: What would be the point?

03:33:38.213 --> 03:33:40.268
LAURA: Has it ever happened like this before?

03:33:40.268 --> 03:33:41.322
MATT: "No."

03:33:41.322 --> 03:33:43.611
LAURA: Anything weird ever happened before?

03:33:43.611 --> 03:33:47.955
MATT: "Weird things? All the time. We're a bunch
of weird folk, work with a lot of weird people.

03:33:47.955 --> 03:33:52.526
Bunch of strange freaks gathered to this show."

03:33:52.938 --> 03:33:57.163
MARISHA: Was there anyone new here recently that
you haven't worked with a lot?

03:33:57.163 --> 03:33:59.466
MATT: "Yeah, she apparently ran off."

03:33:59.466 --> 03:34:04.208
TALIESIN: Yasha's the newest, but she can be
flighty.

03:34:04.208 --> 03:34:09.819
MARISHA: What about Mona and Yuli?

03:34:11.751 --> 03:34:17.048
MATT: "The sisters are bitter, but it's no fault
of theirs."

03:34:17.048 --> 03:34:18.836
MARISHA: Why are they bitter?

03:34:19.312 --> 03:34:21.332
MATT: "Because the world is cruel."

03:34:21.332 --> 03:34:23.359
TALIESIN: You've never met it-- Well, nevermind.

03:34:23.359 --> 03:34:25.669
MATT: "I wish I could help them, but it--"

03:34:25.669 --> 03:34:29.633
MARISHA: (stutters) What happened to them?

03:34:29.633 --> 03:34:31.902
LAURA: Are you drunk? What's going on?

03:34:31.902 --> 03:34:35.126
MARISHA: No, I'm trying to hear and whisper at the
same time.

03:34:35.126 --> 03:34:38.876
LAURA: You can talk at a normal volume.

03:34:38.876 --> 03:34:40.518
MATT: Magical whisper. Cone of Whisper.

03:34:40.595 --> 03:34:43.310
MARISHA: Matt Cone of Whisper!

03:34:43.310 --> 03:34:45.583
TALIESIN: Oh God, that's a new thing now.

03:34:45.583 --> 03:34:50.092
MARISHA: What did they say? Why do they think
that? Why is the world shitty?

03:34:50.092 --> 03:34:53.330
MATT: "Have you been around? Have you travelled to
see anything?"

03:34:53.330 --> 03:34:59.245
MARISHA: Yeah. Listen. The world has its own brand
of shitty depending on whose eyes are looking at

03:34:59.245 --> 03:35:04.640
it, right? So what is their brand of shitty?

03:35:04.640 --> 03:35:05.922
TALIESIN: Circus shitty.

03:35:05.922 --> 03:35:08.235
MATT: "I don't know. Ask them."

03:35:09.875 --> 03:35:11.390
MARISHA: Where are they?

03:35:11.487 --> 03:35:13.730
TALIESIN: In a tent over there.

03:35:13.730 --> 03:35:18.590
MATT: "They don't seem to take much of a liking to
me anyway, so I can't really tell you myself. I'm

03:35:18.590 --> 03:35:19.701
"sorry."

03:35:19.701 --> 03:35:21.853
SAM: They don't like you? Why?

03:35:21.853 --> 03:35:24.862
MATT: "There's a lot of people that don't like
me."

03:35:24.862 --> 03:35:27.486
LAURA: I like you, Desmond. I think you're great.

03:35:27.486 --> 03:35:29.746
SAM: Why? What did you do?

03:35:29.746 --> 03:35:34.320
MATT: He looks at you and goes, "Same reason folks
probably don't like you; you're different."

03:35:34.320 --> 03:35:36.704
SAM: Hmm.

03:35:36.704 --> 03:35:40.074
TALIESIN: Is everybody still here? They've not
taken anyone away other than--

03:35:40.074 --> 03:35:42.914
MATT: "Other than those two, everyone else is
here. We're just keeping under watch until their

03:35:42.914 --> 03:35:44.861
"investigation is complete."

03:35:44.861 --> 03:35:47.844
MARISHA: Molly, why did you laugh when I asked
about the sisters?

03:35:51.204 --> 03:36:00.842
TALIESIN: We're carnival people, we've all got our
issues. You don't end up here if you're not

03:36:00.842 --> 03:36:02.829
a little weird.

03:36:02.879 --> 03:36:09.124
LAURA: Can I try something? I want to try to cast
Detect Good and Evil.

03:36:09.124 --> 03:36:10.150
MATT: Okay.

03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:11.535
LIAM: Cleric shit!

03:36:11.535 --> 03:36:12.704
LAURA: Right?

03:36:12.704 --> 03:36:13.636
SAM: On?

03:36:13.636 --> 03:36:20.674
LAURA: On the area. It lasts up to ten minutes, so
it's within 30 feet of me.

03:36:20.674 --> 03:36:21.687
TRAVIS: You ever cast this before?

03:36:21.687 --> 03:36:22.283
LAURA: No.

03:36:22.283 --> 03:36:24.366
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: First cast!

03:36:24.366 --> 03:36:26.966
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: First blood!

03:36:28.058 --> 03:36:33.892
MATT: So you cast it. You concentrate. You reach
down and grasp the bottom of your symbol that

03:36:33.892 --> 03:36:46.239
hangs around your belt, and there's a faint rush
of divine force given to your consciousness. You

03:36:46.239 --> 03:36:54.686
don't sense within 30 feet of you any fiendish, or
celestial, or fey, or undead, or aberration.

03:36:54.686 --> 03:36:57.075
LAURA: Nothing that's been desecrated?

03:36:57.075 --> 03:36:59.664
MATT: Nothing from this tent or within 30 feet.

03:36:59.664 --> 03:37:00.990
SAM: Does it follow her?

03:37:00.990 --> 03:37:01.990
LAURA: Yeah, it follows me.

03:37:01.990 --> 03:37:03.513
MATT: It's like a radial thing.

03:37:03.513 --> 03:37:05.978
SAM: That's pretty cool, let's keep going then.
Maybe we'll see something?

03:37:05.978 --> 03:37:12.911
LAURA: Yeah. Am I close to the edge of the main
tent?

03:37:12.911 --> 03:37:17.831
MATT: There are two tents to the north. There's a
bigger one, and a medium one. The one that you're

03:37:17.831 --> 03:37:22.907
in right now is the larger one to the north, and
as such contains-- Actually no. The one that you

03:37:22.907 --> 03:37:26.784
guys are in right now is the medium one. The one
that contains Desmond. The larger one contains

03:37:26.784 --> 03:37:30.022
both of the sisters and Ornna.

03:37:30.022 --> 03:37:34.938
LAURA: Okay. And they're closer to the big tent?
Where is the big tent?

03:37:34.938 --> 03:37:37.698
MATT: Correct. The big tent is about ten to 15
feet from the one you're in right now.

03:37:37.698 --> 03:37:43.931
LAURA: Okay, cool. Yeah, let's leave. I'll get up
to the edge of the big tent, and I want to see if

03:37:43.931 --> 03:37:46.665
I can feel anything weird in that area.

03:37:46.665 --> 03:37:48.386
MATT: Okay. Is everyone else staying inside or are
you going with her?

03:37:48.386 --> 03:37:54.321
SAM: We're going with, but before we leave I'll
ask Desmond: From one outcast to another, are

03:37:54.321 --> 03:37:58.524
there any questions that are bugging &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;
about all this?

03:38:02.003 --> 03:38:09.054
MATT: He thinks for a second. "I don't want this
all to fall on Gustav. He's done a lot of good for"

03:38:09.054 --> 03:38:13.286
"all of us, and the way they're talking about the
investigation, they're looking to make a scapegoat"

03:38:13.286 --> 03:38:14.840
"of this."

03:38:18.508 --> 03:38:20.951
SAM: Well, thank you.

03:38:20.951 --> 03:38:22.471
MATT: "Thank you."

03:38:22.471 --> 03:38:34.160
SAM: (mimics bird call poorly) That's how they
talk to each other. That's how carnival folk talk

03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:36.482
to each other.

03:38:36.482 --> 03:38:41.870
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake. I'm going to do my
best.

03:38:41.870 --> 03:38:43.518
MATT: "Thank you."

03:38:43.518 --> 03:38:48.336
TALIESIN: I'm going to quietly sneak out the back
of the tent again and sneak into the--

03:38:48.336 --> 03:38:49.987
MATT: Another stealth check, my friends.

03:38:49.987 --> 03:38:54.067
TALIESIN: Oh god, I hate all of this.

03:38:54.067 --> 03:39:00.489
LAURA: I'm going to give Molly Blessing, so you
get advantage.

03:39:00.489 --> 03:39:01.982
SAM: 21.

03:39:02.035 --> 03:39:04.103
MARISHA: 13. Not great.

03:39:04.103 --> 03:39:05.564
TALIESIN: 13.

03:39:05.564 --> 03:39:06.343
MATT: With advantage?

03:39:06.343 --> 03:39:07.508
TALIESIN: With advantage.

03:39:07.508 --> 03:39:08.579
LAURA: 12.

03:39:08.579 --> 03:39:14.286
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way up to the edge
of the tent.

03:39:19.221 --> 03:39:20.696
TALIESIN: I'm not going to make the noise I'm just
going to--

03:39:20.696 --> 03:39:25.120
MATT: Right. As you make your way over to the edge
of the tent where the sisters and Ornna are, you

03:39:25.120 --> 03:39:34.533
focus and concentrate. Nothing, from the radial
thing. One of the guards, who's standing up and

03:39:34.533 --> 03:39:42.238
making a patrol, looks over right as you duck
behind and you hear a "Huh?"

03:39:42.238 --> 03:39:44.532
SAM: Uh oh.

03:39:45.482 --> 03:39:46.401
LAURA: Quick, go in the tent.

03:39:46.401 --> 03:39:48.139
TALIESIN: We're going to go in the tent.

03:39:48.139 --> 03:39:51.817
LAURA: We all duck under the tent go and act like
we're sleeping.

03:39:51.817 --> 03:39:55.097
MATT: You guys all dodge under the tent just as
the guard begins to pass around. You hear the

03:39:55.097 --> 03:39:58.807
footsteps around. As you step in you watch as the
two Knot sisters--

03:39:58.807 --> 03:40:01.797
TALIESIN: (shushes)

03:40:01.797 --> 03:40:06.317
MATT: They both curl into a ball and stay really
quiet. All of the sudden Ornna comes to

03:40:06.317 --> 03:40:11.551
consciousness and (light footsteps)

03:40:15.112 --> 03:40:22.599
the footsteps finish the circle
and then go back towards where the fire is.

03:40:22.599 --> 03:40:23.925
LAURA: That was close.

03:40:23.925 --> 03:40:27.442
MATT: Ornna leans in, goes like, "Okay, what is
going on."

03:40:27.442 --> 03:40:31.963
TALIESIN: That's what I'm trying to figure out,
what the fuck is going on. They're with me, it's

03:40:31.963 --> 03:40:41.260
been complicated. Gustav's in deep. Bosun's in
deep.

03:40:41.260 --> 03:40:43.921
LAURA: Tell us you know something.

03:40:43.921 --> 03:40:45.061
MATT: "What do you want to know?"

03:40:45.061 --> 03:40:46.450
TALIESIN: What did you see? I don't know.

03:40:46.450 --> 03:40:50.529
SAM: Who did this? What was it?

03:40:50.529 --> 03:40:55.454
MATT: "I don't know. I looked and I saw what you
saw."

03:40:55.454 --> 03:40:56.658
TALIESIN: This is Ornna I assume.

03:40:56.658 --> 03:40:57.617
MATT: This is Ornna, yeah.

03:40:57.617 --> 03:40:58.839
TALIESIN: Ornna is the fire dancer.

03:40:58.839 --> 03:41:00.503
MARISHA: Right, okay.

03:41:00.503 --> 03:41:05.729
TALIESIN: For fuck's sake, they're going
to kill every last fucking one of us unless

03:41:05.729 --> 03:41:07.619
we figure this out.

03:41:07.619 --> 03:41:08.849
MATT: She's like, "Right."

03:41:08.849 --> 03:41:10.008
TALIESIN: What do you think?

03:41:10.008 --> 03:41:14.169
MATT: "Well the sister's over here think it's a
hit job, but this isn't a hit job with zombies?

03:41:14.169 --> 03:41:17.419
"Are you fucking kidding me?"

03:41:17.419 --> 03:41:22.784
TALIESIN: I don't know. I think that they're
trying to cover something.

03:41:22.784 --> 03:41:25.516
MATT: "That's not surprising."

03:41:25.516 --> 03:41:29.206
MARISHA: Can I insight check the sisters? What are
they doing right now?

03:41:29.206 --> 03:41:31.905
MATT: They're both just quietly curled up and
watching you guys talk.

03:41:31.905 --> 03:41:33.032
MARISHA: They're not saying anything, though?

03:41:33.032 --> 03:41:35.505
MATT: Not yet. If you want to ask them something
you can.

03:41:35.505 --> 03:41:37.709
MARISHA: Do they look nervous or are they just
being shifty?

03:41:37.709 --> 03:41:39.054
MATT: Make an insight check to find out.

03:41:39.054 --> 03:41:40.353
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:41:40.353 --> 03:41:43.444
LAURA: While she's doing that I'm going to try and
sneak out the underside of the tent to go to the

03:41:43.444 --> 03:41:46.375
big tent.

03:41:46.375 --> 03:41:48.483
SAM: I'll go with her.

03:41:48.483 --> 03:41:55.721
MATT: This is a bit of a leap. This goes about 25,
30 feet south of where you are around the campfire

03:41:55.721 --> 03:41:57.096
that's open.

03:41:57.096 --> 03:41:59.531
SAM: No problem.

03:41:59.531 --> 03:42:03.074
MATT: Go ahead and make your stealth checks,
guys.

03:42:03.074 --> 03:42:07.502
TALIESIN: Oh god. I miss Pass Without a Trace so
much.

03:42:07.502 --> 03:42:08.982
SAM: 23.

03:42:12.132 --> 03:42:15.938
TALIESIN: That's a number.

03:42:15.938 --> 03:42:17.730
LAURA: Nine.

03:42:19.695 --> 03:42:26.175
MATT: Okay. What was your insight check?

03:42:26.175 --> 03:42:27.349
MARISHA: 15.

03:42:27.349 --> 03:42:32.499
MATT: 15. They both look nervous, but just
untrusting of the scenario. You can't read

03:42:32.499 --> 03:42:41.820
anything deeper than that. There is definitely a,
hmm, but you can't quite get a full bead on them.

03:42:41.820 --> 03:42:46.039
You guys, as you curl around the outside, there's
the one guard that's sitting in the chair by the

03:42:46.122 --> 03:42:53.645
fire that goes like (snores) and opens his eyes a
little bit and looks over in your direction,

03:42:53.645 --> 03:43:01.442
Jester, and there's a brief moment where he's just
looking right at you. Do you do anything?

03:43:01.442 --> 03:43:06.901
LAURA: I freeze.

03:43:06.901 --> 03:43:11.322
SAM: Oh god.

03:43:11.322 --> 03:43:12.706
MATT: Stands up.

03:43:12.706 --> 03:43:18.372
LAURA: Can I use-- oh shit. I'm going shitballs,
shit.

03:43:18.372 --> 03:43:21.978
SAM: I'm just tucking around, getting ready.

03:43:21.978 --> 03:43:23.266
MATT: You're around, you don't see anything.

03:43:23.266 --> 03:43:25.616
SAM: I don't see this?

03:43:25.616 --> 03:43:27.059
MATT: Sorry, he doesn't see you.

03:43:27.059 --> 03:43:32.649
LAURA: I'm going to cast Charm Person on the guard
that sees me.

03:43:32.649 --> 03:43:39.295
MATT: Okay. As he stands up, he goes toward you
and he goes for his blade and he has to make a

03:43:39.295 --> 03:43:40.307
saving throw.

03:43:40.307 --> 03:43:41.900
SAM: Oh boy.

03:43:41.900 --> 03:43:45.693
MATT: Which he does not make. I don't think so,
it's like a six.

03:43:45.693 --> 03:43:47.977
SAM: No, it's like 13 or something.

03:43:47.977 --> 03:43:49.021
LAURA: Yeah.

03:43:49.021 --> 03:43:50.960
MATT: So he goes like--

03:43:50.960 --> 03:43:56.620
LAURA: Hi, I'm not here.

03:43:56.620 --> 03:43:58.077
MATT: "Okay."

03:43:58.077 --> 03:44:04.537
LAURA: Okay. Sit down. Go to sleep, this is a
dream.

03:44:04.537 --> 03:44:06.194
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:44:06.194 --> 03:44:09.774
TALIESIN: That's so good.

03:44:12.087 --> 03:44:19.942
LAURA: That's so close. This is so bad. Five.

03:44:20.028 --> 03:44:24.309
MATT: He doesn't seem to buy the dream thing, but
he's like--

03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:27.731
LAURA: You want it to be a dream.

03:44:27.731 --> 03:44:29.885
MATT: He doesn't go to sleep but he knows
you're there and he's keeping an eye, but

03:44:29.885 --> 03:44:31.490
he's not doing anything.

03:44:31.490 --> 03:44:36.294
LAURA: Okay, well it's good enough, I guess.

03:44:36.478 --> 03:44:40.130
MATT: But he's definitely aware that you're
there.

03:44:40.130 --> 03:44:45.106
LAURA: I'm going to go towards the big tent just
so I can see if I can sense any evil.

03:44:45.106 --> 03:44:54.495
MATT: Okay. Really quickly, just to check because
it's-- That's right, Charm Person is not--

03:44:54.495 --> 03:44:56.561
LAURA: It's not, yes.

03:44:56.561 --> 03:45:04.547
MATT: Okay. It's at this point that you turn your
attention to the tent and focus. There is a hefty,

03:45:04.547 --> 03:45:10.625
radiating warm fiendish source from the inside of
that large tent.

03:45:10.625 --> 03:45:12.505
SAM: We found something!

03:45:12.505 --> 03:45:17.853
LAURA: I can sense something. Let's go in the
tent.

03:45:17.853 --> 03:45:20.402
SAM: Go in? But if it's bad, that's bad.

03:45:20.402 --> 03:45:22.485
LAURA: What if it's just a dead thing?

03:45:22.485 --> 03:45:29.925
SAM: Oh god, will we have to fight a dead thing?
Should we get some help? I turn to Caleb's cat and

03:45:29.925 --> 03:45:38.250
I say go! Go get Caleb! Shoo! (hiss) Go away!
(hiss) I can't speak Cat! Go away!

03:45:38.250 --> 03:45:41.502
MATT: The cat goes, (angry meow).

03:45:41.502 --> 03:45:43.668
SAM: Go away! Go tell Caleb we're here!

03:45:43.668 --> 03:45:45.231
MATT: (hiss)

03:45:45.231 --> 03:45:48.653
LIAM: Yes!

03:45:48.653 --> 03:45:53.515
MATT: Turns around and sprays you and then keep
walking.

03:45:53.515 --> 03:45:54.681
SAM: Okay, I've sent for help.

03:45:54.681 --> 03:45:58.729
LAURA: Okay. Let's go under the tent.

03:45:58.729 --> 03:45:59.812
SAM: All right, let's go.

03:45:59.812 --> 03:46:07.395
MATT: You guys carefully maneuver under the tent.
As soon as you curl into the interior of the tent

03:46:07.395 --> 03:46:17.341
you hear a very heavy (snoring).

03:46:17.341 --> 03:46:18.976
LAURA: This the big tent that you guys were just
in?

03:46:18.976 --> 03:46:19.774
SAM: No.

03:46:19.774 --> 03:46:21.132
MATT: No, it's the one on the south side of it.

03:46:21.132 --> 03:46:22.544
SAM: It's a different one.

03:46:22.544 --> 03:46:23.465
LAURA: Oh!

03:46:23.465 --> 03:46:25.460
MARISHA: Toad guy.

03:46:25.460 --> 03:46:32.869
MATT: You see the slowly expanding and contracting
form of Kylre from the back side. You see this

03:46:32.869 --> 03:46:38.390
giant, scaly, somewhat oily exterior of the body.

03:46:38.390 --> 03:46:41.113
SAM: That's why you detected him, because he's a
fiend.

03:46:41.113 --> 03:46:43.509
LAURA: Maybe he's a good fiend, can fiends be
good?

03:46:43.509 --> 03:46:47.647
SAM: I don't know, you detected--

03:46:47.647 --> 03:46:49.428
LAURA: Is he still sleeping?

03:46:49.428 --> 03:46:51.013
MATT: (snoring)

03:46:51.013 --> 03:46:52.100
LAURA: He's still sleeping.

03:46:52.100 --> 03:46:53.696
SAM: We can wake him up and ask?

03:46:53.696 --> 03:46:55.326
LAURA: And ask if he's good or bad?

03:46:55.326 --> 03:46:56.577
SAM: Yeah?

03:46:56.577 --> 03:46:58.535
LAURA and SAM: Eh.

03:46:58.535 --> 03:47:00.585
SAM: Is anyone else in the tent?

03:47:00.585 --> 03:47:03.008
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:47:03.008 --> 03:47:04.994
SAM: One.

03:47:04.994 --> 03:47:09.814
LAURA: Oh no, we suck at this.

03:47:09.814 --> 03:47:11.182
LIAM: This? Everything!

03:47:11.182 --> 03:47:12.190
LAURA: 17.

03:47:12.190 --> 03:47:17.238
MATT: Okay, that's better. You just stare right at
the body of this toad going, "Nope."

03:47:17.238 --> 03:47:19.792
SAM: This looks really big and scary.

03:47:19.967 --> 03:47:25.540
MATT: You glance and see a faint bit of a whitish
material from the crook of the arm. You take a few

03:47:25.540 --> 03:47:32.871
steps forward and glance from the side and you can
see asleep, cradled in his large, lizardman arms,

03:47:32.871 --> 03:47:38.149
Toya, dwarf girl is curled up and asleep
peacefully.

03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:43.737
SAM: We should talk to her, but if we wake her up
he's going to be mad. I guess we have no choice,

03:47:43.737 --> 03:47:49.782
we should talk to her. She's a dwarf? Do you speak
Dwarvish?

03:47:49.782 --> 03:47:52.004
LAURA: No, I don't.

03:47:52.004 --> 03:47:58.235
SAM: Maybe she speaks Common. We'll be fine. She's
a circus person.

03:47:58.235 --> 03:48:02.367
LIAM: I have that ability, it lets you know
exactly where the fiend is. Which of those

03:48:02.367 --> 03:48:04.036
things is the fiend?

03:48:04.036 --> 03:48:06.521
LAURA: Which of the things is the fiend?

03:48:06.521 --> 03:48:07.666
MATT: It's the large source.

03:48:07.666 --> 03:48:09.218
LAURA: It's definitely the large fiend.

03:48:09.218 --> 03:48:10.303
LIAM: It could have easily been the little girl.

03:48:10.303 --> 03:48:12.064
MATT: It could have been, yeah.

03:48:12.064 --> 03:48:13.314
LAURA: It's the big guy.

03:48:13.314 --> 03:48:14.827
SAM: Let's wake her up!

03:48:14.827 --> 03:48:18.051
MATT: The radiance is around the large creature.

03:48:18.051 --> 03:48:19.158
LAURA: And her name is Toya?

03:48:19.158 --> 03:48:20.856
SAM: Toya. Singing dwarf.

03:48:20.856 --> 03:48:28.279
LAURA: Let's sit down on the ground and look
non-threatening. So we sit down cross-legged. Just

03:48:28.279 --> 03:48:31.195
casual. Like we're having a tea party.

03:48:31.407 --> 03:48:33.368
SAM: Put down my hair.

03:48:33.368 --> 03:48:38.711
LAURA: And then we go: Toya! Toya wake up!

03:48:38.711 --> 03:48:41.828
SAM: Wakey wakey!

03:48:41.828 --> 03:48:45.655
MATT: The breathing stops and there's this
stillness in the interior of the tent.

03:48:45.655 --> 03:48:50.537
SAM: We should light a light or something?
Otherwise we're just in the dark.

03:48:50.537 --> 03:49:01.575
MATT: You hear this faint sound of squeaking as
lubricated folds of lizardman flesh twist over

03:49:01.575 --> 03:49:07.745
each other as the devil toad's head kind of curls
back to look at you quietly, the mouth slightly

03:49:07.745 --> 03:49:17.074
ajar. You can see rows of teeth and this bit of
drool down the edge of the chin onto the ground.

03:49:20.518 --> 03:49:25.676
"What. you. want?"

03:49:25.676 --> 03:49:28.556
LAURA: We're here to talk to Toya.

03:49:28.556 --> 03:49:38.532
MATT: At which point the little girl (yawn) begins
(grunt) (thumping) and rotates in his space. He

03:49:38.532 --> 03:49:43.689
takes up almost the entirety of this tent. And
slowly rotates around inside. Surprisingly quiet

03:49:43.689 --> 03:49:54.874
for his size. And still clutching Toya, Toya sits
up and is like "What's happening? (yawn)"

03:49:54.874 --> 03:49:55.653
LAURA: Hi!

03:49:55.653 --> 03:49:56.818
MATT: "Hi!"

03:49:56.818 --> 03:49:59.179
SAM: Sorry to disturb your slumber.

03:49:59.179 --> 03:50:02.838
MATT: She takes her braids and holds them with her
hands, it's almost a safety blanket she curls into

03:50:02.838 --> 03:50:11.515
herself. She looks about 11 or 12. This close you
can see she looks younger than she did from that

03:50:11.515 --> 03:50:18.562
distance. Whether it be the presence or the mature
voice. But she seems pretty young. But she's not

03:50:18.562 --> 03:50:19.679
childlike.

03:50:19.679 --> 03:50:25.038
LAURA: Oh hey! What's going on.

03:50:25.038 --> 03:50:27.392
MATT: " Well?"

03:50:27.392 --> 03:50:31.157
SAM: Do you recognize us from the other night?
Last night?

03:50:31.157 --> 03:50:32.407
LAURA: Last night.

03:50:32.407 --> 03:50:33.712
SAM: Last night?

03:50:33.712 --> 03:50:35.842
MATT: "I don't remember, I got scared."

03:50:35.842 --> 03:50:39.300
LAURA: It was scary. You have a really pretty
voice.

03:50:39.300 --> 03:50:42.111
MATT: "Thank you."

03:50:42.111 --> 03:50:47.979
LAURA: Did you notice how when you sang that a
dude turned into a zombie?

03:50:47.979 --> 03:50:57.689
MATT: She begins to chuckle. And the big toad
(laughter). "I did. It was really scary! I didn't

03:50:57.689 --> 03:51:01.017
"like it at all. I didn't do that, did I?"

03:51:01.017 --> 03:51:02.754
LAURA: Probably not.

03:51:02.754 --> 03:51:05.132
SAM: Has it happened before, or was that--

03:51:05.132 --> 03:51:09.464
MATT: "No. The guards are saying I probably did
that, they're saying I might have done that." It's

03:51:09.464 --> 03:51:12.808
interesting, you notice now listening to her, she
has this beautiful voice but her speaking voice is

03:51:12.808 --> 03:51:19.379
very crackly. It sounds almost damaged.

03:51:19.379 --> 03:51:21.478
LAURA: Do you sing all the time, Toya?

03:51:21.478 --> 03:51:27.539
MATT: "I sing a lot. It's what keeps me alive,
it's what gets me money."

03:51:27.539 --> 03:51:29.571
LAURA: Right. I understand that.

03:51:29.571 --> 03:51:31.960
SAM: Was that the same song you always sing?

03:51:31.960 --> 03:51:35.190
MATT: "Yeah. It's the one song I know."

03:51:35.190 --> 03:51:39.493
SAM: Did it feel the same coming out of you or was
it different?

03:51:39.493 --> 03:51:40.851
MATT: "It felt the same."

03:51:40.851 --> 03:51:44.252
LAURA: What language is it?

03:51:44.252 --> 03:51:49.239
MATT: "It's an old dwarven tune. My mother taught
it to me before she passed."

03:51:49.239 --> 03:51:51.825
LAURA: What does it mean?

03:51:51.825 --> 03:52:01.684
MATT: "It's a tale of the angels and how they came
from the realms beyond of the gods. They granted

03:52:01.684 --> 03:52:08.360
"each to us our sparks of life."

03:52:08.360 --> 03:52:17.128
LAURA: Granted sparks of life. Does that sound
like a familiar story that I've heard before?

03:52:17.128 --> 03:52:23.042
MATT: It sounds vaguely religious, but--

03:52:23.042 --> 03:52:30.451
SAM: When you were singing, did you hear any other
sounds or words that someone else was saying?

03:52:30.451 --> 03:52:38.669
MATT: "No, not beyond the ordinary. Then I saw
that poor man just start tearing through people. I

03:52:38.669 --> 03:52:44.916
"got scared and Kylre helped me." She puts her arm
up and pats and (grunt).

03:52:44.916 --> 03:52:48.019
LAURA: How did you and Kylre meet?

03:52:48.019 --> 03:52:56.513
MATT: "They brought me into the circus. I was up
in a city north of here, far north of the Marrow

03:52:56.513 --> 03:53:04.105
"Valley and I was just on the streets singing. And
this carnival came by and I met Gustav and he

03:53:04.105 --> 03:53:12.045
"invited me to join and that's how I met Kylre and
I met all these wonderful people."

03:53:12.045 --> 03:53:16.230
SAM: Has anyone new come around and talked to
you?

03:53:16.230 --> 03:53:17.210
MATT: "No."

03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:22.503
SAM: Asked you to do anything? It's so strange.

03:53:22.503 --> 03:53:25.870
LAURA: Man, we suck at this.

03:53:25.870 --> 03:53:29.713
SAM: No, we're really good.

03:53:29.713 --> 03:53:35.472
MATT: "The newest people we've had are Mollymauk
and Yasha."

03:53:35.472 --> 03:53:36.881
LAURA: They're new?

03:53:36.881 --> 03:53:41.907
MATT: "Comparatively. Mollymauk's been here almost
two years now."

03:53:41.907 --> 03:53:44.019
LAURA: Oh. Okay.

03:53:44.019 --> 03:53:52.270
MATT: "He came after I did. We both found our
voice together. I was very scared and he wasn't

03:53:52.270 --> 03:54:03.010
"talking and together we helped each other learn to
have fun again."

03:54:03.010 --> 03:54:09.028
SAM: And yesterday before the show you didn't
notice anything weird, anyone creeping around the

03:54:09.028 --> 03:54:11.721
carnival, setting up anything?

03:54:11.721 --> 03:54:12.534
MATT: "No."

03:54:12.534 --> 03:54:14.287
SAM: Snooping around?

03:54:14.287 --> 03:54:16.354
LAURA: Anybody in weird cloaks?

03:54:16.354 --> 03:54:18.178
SAM: Cloaks, cloaks!

03:54:18.178 --> 03:54:21.041
MATT: "I didn't see anything."

03:54:21.041 --> 03:54:22.676
LAURA: Okay.

03:54:22.676 --> 03:54:27.452
LIAM: DM, on a minor note, I put my hand on
Fjord's shoulder and say I'm going to be blind for

03:54:27.452 --> 03:54:34.877
a second, give me a little slap if anything goes
wrong. And I tune into Frumpkin who should still be--

03:54:34.877 --> 03:54:45.022
MATT: At this point in time you notice (laughter)
Nott going "Shoo! Cah! Go find help!" and you hear

03:54:45.022 --> 03:54:49.540
a (hiss) (grumpy meow). Yeah.

03:54:49.540 --> 03:54:51.664
LIAM: And then Frumpkin takes off?

03:54:51.664 --> 03:54:54.327
MATT: Frumpkin starts heading back around towards
you.

03:54:54.327 --> 03:54:56.745
LIAM: So I'm looking at myself after a moment.

03:54:56.745 --> 03:55:03.252
MATT: Briefly, as you keep concentrating, Frumpkin
finds his way under the tent and comes up to you.

03:55:03.252 --> 03:55:09.505
SAM: Is there anyone you think would want to
destroy the carnival or hurt Gustav? Does Gustav

03:55:09.505 --> 03:55:11.930
have any enemies?

03:55:11.930 --> 03:55:15.867
MATT: "I hope not. I know him and Ornna argue a
lot, but--"

03:55:15.867 --> 03:55:21.046
SAM: Him and Ornna? It's Ornna! Ornna's the one.
Thanks very much, we're out of here.

03:55:21.046 --> 03:55:25.773
(laughter)

03:55:28.464 --> 03:55:29.657
SAM: Hot lead!

03:55:29.657 --> 03:55:32.327
LAURA: Let's go! We've got it, we've solved the
case!

03:55:32.327 --> 03:55:36.037
TALIESIN: I'm going to have a tiny bit of
conversation with her.

03:55:36.037 --> 03:55:39.915
MATT: Yeah. So while they're gone, the two of you
are in the other tent with the sisters and Ornna.

03:55:39.915 --> 03:55:44.967
MARISHA: I would like to talk with the sisters
while that is going on.

03:55:45.841 --> 03:55:49.052
MATT: They're both sitting there, knees tucked to
their chest.

03:55:49.052 --> 03:56:02.038
MARISHA: I go and sit down next to them, putting
my knees up, too. This whole thing is really

03:56:02.038 --> 03:56:03.819
messed up, right?

03:56:03.819 --> 03:56:05.561
MATT: "Yeah, you're telling us."

03:56:05.561 --> 03:56:14.597
MARISHA: Yeah. Man. Like, why would we do anything
like that? I feel like we're all being needlessly

03:56:14.597 --> 03:56:16.358
persecuted.

03:56:17.229 --> 03:56:19.174
MATT: "I'm sorry, who are you?"

03:56:19.174 --> 03:56:30.438
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. I'm Beau. The other Bo, but I
helped fight the zombies the other night. I'm

03:56:30.438 --> 03:56:34.275
under house arrest. We're under the same
situation, just separately. Not really. I don't

03:56:34.275 --> 03:56:38.426
want to compare myself to you, because that would
be rude.

03:56:38.794 --> 03:56:43.122
MATT: The two halfling twins look at each other,
and back at you.

03:56:43.476 --> 03:56:51.408
TALIESIN: Her name's Beau. She's helping, she's
awful, you have a lot in common.

03:56:51.408 --> 03:56:54.689
MATT: "Okay, well, I mean, whatever you want to
know."

03:56:54.689 --> 03:56:58.200
MARISHA: He's such a dick. Why is he such a dick?

03:56:58.274 --> 03:57:00.782
MATT: "Molly's great, why are you such a dick?"

03:57:00.782 --> 03:57:02.949
TRAVIS: Reversal!

03:57:02.949 --> 03:57:06.749
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, he's been talking shit about
you this whole time, I don't know, I just--

03:57:06.749 --> 03:57:08.906
MATT: Make a deception check on that.

03:57:08.906 --> 03:57:10.534
TRAVIS and LIAM: Oh.

03:57:10.534 --> 03:57:12.867
LIAM: Stirring the pot.

03:57:12.867 --> 03:57:17.047
MARISHA: It's okay. 15.

03:57:17.047 --> 03:57:20.295
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk by the two twins,
because I'm circling the tent, trying to get a

03:57:20.295 --> 03:57:23.915
look, and be like, I've absolutely been talking
shit. You're both terrible. I give them both a

03:57:23.915 --> 03:57:26.218
kiss on the head and keep walking.

03:57:26.218 --> 03:57:31.514
MATT: Okay. They both, "All right, so what are you
trying to do?"

03:57:31.514 --> 03:57:37.356
MARISHA: What am I trying to do? I'm trying to
figure out who's behind all this so that we can

03:57:37.356 --> 03:57:40.291
keep moving on with our lives.

03:57:40.291 --> 03:57:44.884
MATT: "All right, well, get it over with. Soon as
this is done, we're out."

03:57:44.884 --> 03:57:49.188
TALIESIN: They may not let us leave. They may be
killing us all.

03:57:49.188 --> 03:57:52.659
MATT: "They're not going to kill us all!" The
other goes, "They're not going to kill us all."

03:57:52.659 --> 03:57:55.642
TALIESIN: They're weird out there. They're very
weird out there.

03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:58.291
MATT: (sighs)

03:57:58.291 --> 03:58:02.123
MARISHA: Your guys' performance was amazing, by
the way.

03:58:02.123 --> 03:58:04.216
MATT: "Thanks."

03:58:04.216 --> 03:58:05.330
MARISHA: I loved it.

03:58:05.330 --> 03:58:07.247
SAM: We're stealthing over to that tent, by the
way.

03:58:07.247 --> 03:58:09.504
LAURA: I thought we were stealthing over to the
main tent.

03:58:09.504 --> 03:58:11.396
SAM: The one with Ornna in it.

03:58:11.396 --> 03:58:13.438
TALIESIN: Ornna's in the tent with us.

03:58:13.438 --> 03:58:15.795
MATT: Oh, you guys are going to the main tent.

03:58:15.795 --> 03:58:19.269
LAURA: I wanted to get to the main tent to see if
I could sense any evil in the big, main tent.

03:58:19.269 --> 03:58:21.034
SAM: Oh, you want to swoop by the main tent?

03:58:21.034 --> 03:58:22.787
LAURA: But if it's really far away.

03:58:22.787 --> 03:58:25.130
MATT: Not too far away from where you were,
because you're backing out the side of it. So you

03:58:25.130 --> 03:58:27.385
can go ahead and stealth around. Make a stealth
check.

03:58:27.385 --> 03:58:30.001
LAURA: Oh, god. Please no one, please no whammies.

03:58:30.001 --> 03:58:31.712
TALIESIN and LAURA: Big money.

03:58:31.712 --> 03:58:32.943
SAM: I'm fine.

03:58:32.943 --> 03:58:34.459
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:58:34.459 --> 03:58:35.684
MATT: Nice, and what did you get?

03:58:35.684 --> 03:58:36.730
SAM: 22.

03:58:36.730 --> 03:58:42.213
MATT: The two of you, without issue, make your way
around towards the large tent without being seen.

03:58:42.213 --> 03:58:43.836
SAM: Any evil?

03:58:43.836 --> 03:58:44.880
LAURA: I'm sensing it.

03:58:44.880 --> 03:58:45.726
MATT: Nothing.

03:58:45.726 --> 03:58:46.602
SAM: Goddamn it.

03:58:46.602 --> 03:58:47.514
LAURA: No fucking evil!

03:58:47.514 --> 03:58:50.121
SAM: It's Ornna! We know who it is! We know who
the killer is!

03:58:50.121 --> 03:58:53.731
TALIESIN: While you're talking to the twins, I'll
be talking to Ornna. Oh, for fuck's sake.

03:58:53.731 --> 03:58:58.933
MATT: "To be honest, if it's any easier, it's
probably Gustav."

03:58:58.933 --> 03:59:02.321
TALIESIN: It's not fucking Gustav.

03:59:02.321 --> 03:59:07.449
MATT: "It probably is, you shut up. He's a prick,
he doesn't know what he's doing, he's going to run

03:59:07.449 --> 03:59:10.910
this whole carnival into the ground. I don't want
to take the fall for it, we all get away on this.

03:59:12.256 --> 03:59:14.566
MARISHA: No!

03:59:14.566 --> 03:59:19.307
TRAVIS: Little feet.

03:59:19.307 --> 03:59:22.957
LIAM: (snarling noises)

03:59:25.927 --> 03:59:30.178
TRAVIS: Eats and shoots the same way. (snarls)

03:59:30.178 --> 03:59:34.674
MARISHA: So wait, it's probably Gustav? What makes
you say that?

03:59:34.674 --> 03:59:37.603
MATT: "Because he's in prison, he's the leader,
he's fucked this whole thing by letting this

03:59:37.603 --> 03:59:39.272
happen."

03:59:39.272 --> 03:59:44.228
MARISHA: Oh. Wow. You have interesting
perspectives. Hey, weird question, how do you guys

03:59:44.228 --> 03:59:54.615
come up with your acts? Is that something that you
guys create yourselves, or do you guys workshop it?

03:59:55.197 --> 03:59:57.651
TALIESIN: It's like she's never experienced
boredom. It's very weird.

03:59:57.651 --> 03:59:59.642
MATT: "Yeah. It's impressive."

03:59:59.642 --> 04:00:01.080
TALIESIN: Hey, Ornna?

04:00:01.080 --> 04:00:03.675
MATT: Ornna goes, "Yes?"

04:00:03.675 --> 04:00:09.449
TALIESIN: (sighs) I mean, I know your feelings on
all this. What do you think?

04:00:09.449 --> 04:00:20.566
MATT: (sighs) "I'd say Bosun's a stand up guy, if
a bit of a self-absorbed dick at times. And we all

04:00:20.566 --> 04:00:25.020
"knew Gustav was going to shit the bed sooner or
later, I mean, this is his karma. I just don't

04:00:25.020 --> 04:00:29.665
"know how, or why, but I can guarantee you, if this
was my carnival, this shit wouldn't have happened.

04:00:29.667 --> 04:00:31.157
TALIESIN: Really?

04:00:31.157 --> 04:00:32.177
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

04:00:32.177 --> 04:00:35.025
TALIESIN: What exactly would you have done?

04:00:35.025 --> 04:00:40.650
MATT: "Well, first off, I would have made sure
that we had better support from the guard before

04:00:40.650 --> 04:00:43.554
this all happened so nobody else got killed."

04:00:43.584 --> 04:00:46.177
TALIESIN: They were useless.

04:00:46.177 --> 04:00:54.161
MATT: "Secondly, I would have made sure that there
weren't any old folks that made it in to fucking

04:00:54.161 --> 04:00:56.641
turn into shit."

04:00:56.641 --> 04:01:00.561
TALIESIN: Well, that's on me and-- That's on me.

04:01:04.221 --> 04:01:06.330
MATT: "I don't know."

04:01:06.685 --> 04:01:11.376
MARISHA: You feel the same way, Knot sisters? Feel
like this is karma on Gustav?

04:01:11.376 --> 04:01:13.298
TALIESIN: They would.

04:01:13.298 --> 04:01:17.736
MATT: At which point, the flap of the tent opens
up and it's Jester.

04:01:17.736 --> 04:01:19.113
LAURA: It's Ornna!

04:01:19.113 --> 04:01:20.615
SAM: Ornna, you have a lot of explaining to do!

04:01:20.615 --> 04:01:21.789
MARISHA: Shut up!

04:01:21.789 --> 04:01:22.789
SAM: You have a lot of explaining to do!

04:01:22.789 --> 04:01:24.963
MARISHA: Shut up!

04:01:24.963 --> 04:01:28.008
SAM: We've talked to Toya. She knows it's you who
did this!

04:01:28.008 --> 04:01:30.504
LAURA: We know you guys are in a fight all the
time.

04:01:30.504 --> 04:01:32.855
SAM: You're the one behind the whole plot! You did
it!

04:01:32.855 --> 04:01:33.988
LAURA: You!

04:01:34.183 --> 04:01:41.896
MATT: The two Knot sisters immediately go, "Ornna?
Is it you? Did you kill that guy?" Ornna's like,

04:01:41.896 --> 04:01:46.858
"I don't know what you're talking about. What the
fuck is this? Who the fuck are you!"

04:01:46.858 --> 04:01:49.335
LAURA: Why did you turn that guy into a zombie?

04:01:49.335 --> 04:01:50.924
SAM: Who do you work for!

04:01:50.924 --> 04:01:51.966
TALIESIN: Ornna, Ornna.

04:01:51.966 --> 04:01:53.845
MARISHA: Insight check on the Knot sisters!

04:01:53.845 --> 04:01:56.053
MATT: Go for it.

04:01:56.053 --> 04:01:58.086
SAM: They've got Nazi in their name!

04:01:58.086 --> 04:02:00.648
MARISHA: What?!

04:02:00.648 --> 04:02:02.068
SAM: Knot &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt;sters.

04:02:03.848 --> 04:02:05.414
MARISHA: Natural 20!

04:02:05.414 --> 04:02:08.334
[all exclaiming]

04:02:08.334 --> 04:02:10.684
LIAM: Whispers!

04:02:10.684 --> 04:02:12.582
LAURA: The first whisper!

04:02:12.702 --> 04:02:15.194
MARISHA: Give me that sweet whisper!

04:02:15.194 --> 04:02:21.454
SAM: Guys, I don't know about you. But my stats
are so neat because of D&amp;D Beyond tonight.

04:02:21.454 --> 04:02:23.251
LIAM: There's no pencil smudges.

04:02:23.251 --> 04:02:26.498
SAM: No, I know right now I've got 14 of 15 hit
points.

04:02:26.498 --> 04:02:30.438
TRAVIS: It opens, it closes, you can see your
spells when you need to see them without

04:02:30.438 --> 04:02:31.391
flipping.

04:02:31.391 --> 04:02:34.825
TALIESIN: I've got a little iPad button on the
back of my pen, it's quite nice.

04:02:34.825 --> 04:02:41.420
SAM: Start talking, or this gnome-- nope! Goblin!
Starts biting.

04:02:41.420 --> 04:02:46.128
MATT: Ornna goes, "To be perfectly honest, I have
no idea what's going on. Y'all just came in here,

04:02:46.128 --> 04:02:50.375
started throwing accusations at me. Gustav got
arrested. Bosun got arrested. &lt;i&gt;Molly&lt;/i&gt; got

04:02:50.375 --> 04:02:58.308
arrested, I'm glad you got off that. But to be
perfectly honest, this whole thing's a shit show.

04:02:58.308 --> 04:03:01.203
And the circus is probably not going to be the
same after this."

04:03:01.203 --> 04:03:02.707
LAURA: Insight check on the--

04:03:02.707 --> 04:03:04.811
MATT: Insight check on Ornna.

04:03:04.811 --> 04:03:08.386
LIAM: My cat is on patrol because we've been
standing with our dicks in our hands for a long

04:03:08.386 --> 04:03:09.496
time.

04:03:09.541 --> 04:03:11.004
MATT: Yeah, I'm sorry.

04:03:11.004 --> 04:03:14.084
LIAM: No! I'm not complaining, but I would have
sent the cat out.

04:03:14.084 --> 04:03:15.671
LAURA: Seven.

04:03:15.671 --> 04:03:20.700
MATT: Kind of hard to read. She seems genuinely
frustrated and caught off guard by this.

04:03:20.700 --> 04:03:22.291
LAURA: I think she's telling the truth.

04:03:22.291 --> 04:03:25.559
TALIESIN: Ornna, you might as well come clean,
this is classic you.

04:03:25.559 --> 04:03:30.711
MATT: She looks at you. "Molly."

04:03:30.711 --> 04:03:31.587
TALIESIN: I'm just trying to--

04:03:31.587 --> 04:03:32.926
MATT: "Fuck you."

04:03:32.926 --> 04:03:40.454
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck you, too. It's no secret that
Ornna and Gustav have their differences, but this

04:03:40.454 --> 04:03:46.137
ridiculous. I mean, she knows damn well that half
the circus would leave if he got fucking arrested

04:03:46.137 --> 04:03:48.037
and died.

04:03:48.037 --> 04:03:55.619
MATT: "You're for real worried about this? You
really think who it could be? Let's play. Gustav:

04:03:55.619 --> 04:04:03.986
he's an idiot. But he's not a murderer. Bosun: bit
of a dick. But he's a stand up fella. Toya:

04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:14.375
absolute doll. Couldn't hurt a fly. Mona and Yuli:
They're cunts. But they're not going to kill

04:04:14.375 --> 04:04:23.944
anyone. Desmond's a weird fellow. There's
something dark in his past; you can see it in his

04:04:23.944 --> 04:04:26.640
melancholy.

04:04:26.640 --> 04:04:28.263
TALIESIN: But this is not his style.

04:04:28.263 --> 04:04:30.040
SAM: It's Desmond. Let's go to his tent!

04:04:30.040 --> 04:04:32.141
TALIESIN: I just grab--

04:04:33.421 --> 04:04:40.229
MATT: "There's some untrustworthy intelligence in
those lizard eyes of that devil."

04:04:43.059 --> 04:04:45.729
LAURA: I did get a very evil kind of vibe off
him.

04:04:45.898 --> 04:04:47.503
TALIESIN: What do you mean evil kind of vibe?

04:04:47.503 --> 04:04:49.641
LAURA: Well, I mean, he's a fiend.

04:04:49.641 --> 04:04:52.408
TALIESIN: He's what?

04:04:52.408 --> 04:04:56.411
LAURA: The devil toad guy. He's a fiend.

04:04:56.411 --> 04:05:02.624
TALIESIN: That's just a name. It's not actually,
like real thing. That just--

04:05:02.624 --> 04:05:05.624
[stammering]

04:05:05.624 --> 04:05:09.699
LAURA: You guys know he's a fiend, right?

04:05:09.699 --> 04:05:13.426
MATT: There's this moment of silence, like, "He's
supposed to be lizardfolk."

04:05:14.323 --> 04:05:16.945
TALIESIN: What do you--

04:05:16.945 --> 04:05:19.131
SAM: It's the lizard man!

04:05:19.131 --> 04:05:28.692
TALIESIN: I grab and push you down into the ground
and hold you. (shushing sounds) Not yet.

04:05:28.692 --> 04:05:30.632
SAM: We're cracking this case wide open.

04:05:30.632 --> 04:05:33.073
MATT: You guys, what are you doing?

04:05:33.073 --> 04:05:37.742
LIAM: I mean, just because we're standing here so
long, I would have been nervous and again held on

04:05:37.822 --> 04:05:40.449
to this guy's big bicep and sent the cat out.

04:05:40.449 --> 04:05:44.194
TRAVIS: Why are you going all catatonic on me?

04:05:44.194 --> 04:05:53.909
MATT: (laughs) Nice. As the cat darts under the
tent and makes its way through, you glance over to

04:05:53.909 --> 04:06:04.269
the fire and sees a large dark shape step out from
one of the tents and you watch as one of the

04:06:04.269 --> 04:06:13.321
guards who's sitting in the chair stands up and
crumples onto the ground without a sound. You see

04:06:13.378 --> 04:06:22.715
the other guard look over, go over and run up to him
and start to check on him. You guys hear a voice

04:06:22.745 --> 04:06:27.322
in the back start saying, "Damon? Damon?"

04:06:27.704 --> 04:06:30.802
MARISHA: Just a guard. One of the guards.

04:06:30.866 --> 04:06:33.589
LIAM: Fjord, something bad is happening.

04:06:33.589 --> 04:06:40.937
MATT: You watch as the dark figure spins and two
flashes of red in the shadow nearby and you watch

04:06:41.120 --> 04:06:47.057
as the other guard suddenly grabs his head and
grasps at his chest and falls on his back as his

04:06:47.073 --> 04:06:48.615
legs curl up.

04:06:48.615 --> 04:06:50.191
MARISHA: What the fuck!

04:06:50.191 --> 04:06:52.571
LIAM: Do I know where in relation to Fjord and I
this is?

04:06:52.571 --> 04:06:54.914
MATT: It is to the east of you, about 150 feet.

04:06:54.914 --> 04:06:57.017
TRAVIS: Can you talk to me when you're looking
through the cat?

04:06:57.017 --> 04:07:00.145
LIAM: I can talk, but I can't hear anything when
I'm doing this.

04:07:00.145 --> 04:07:03.534
MATT: Correct. You watch as the shadow bounds like
a giant frog--

04:07:05.494 --> 04:07:07.914
LIAM: The frog is on the move. Frog is on the
move.

04:07:07.914 --> 04:07:09.232
MATT: --northward.

04:07:09.232 --> 04:07:14.236
LIAM: Away from us? But I don't know where the
others are.

04:07:16.635 --> 04:07:20.611
MATT: You guys hear the name calling, and then
silence once more.

04:07:20.611 --> 04:07:23.371
LAURA: (whispers) Can we peek outside of the tent
and see what's going on?

04:07:23.371 --> 04:07:31.930
MATT: You guys go ahead and you look just as the
guard on the ground is like (gurgling) and just

04:07:31.930 --> 04:07:35.475
stops moving. You see all the veins bulging.

04:07:35.475 --> 04:07:39.628
MARISHA: I run up to the guard and check his
pulse. Is he still alive or is he paralyzed?

04:07:39.628 --> 04:07:47.107
MATT: As you come out of the tent, you watch as
the flesh on his neck and throat splits and a very

04:07:47.107 --> 04:07:52.179
familiar transformation begins to take place as
both of the guards begin to (growling).

04:07:52.179 --> 04:07:54.860
LAURA: Oh no. We have to fight them.

04:07:54.860 --> 04:07:57.686
MARISHA: Yeah, but get under the tent! We can get
the drop!

04:07:57.686 --> 04:08:05.956
LIAM: I come out of it and I-- Zombies. I start
running towards the tent that I saw Jester peek

04:08:06.141 --> 04:08:07.335
out from under.

04:08:07.335 --> 04:08:14.488
MATT: As you guys rush underneath the big blue
tent, you watch as the two guards that are quickly

04:08:14.511 --> 04:08:18.781
bulging and mutating, bits of their flesh
dislodging from their body and falling. You watch

04:08:18.781 --> 04:08:24.161
now, up close, similar to the last time, but now
that you are looking intently for this, you can

04:08:24.161 --> 04:08:31.566
see where there should be blood, it's almost like
dust and sand begin to spill from the wounds.

04:08:31.566 --> 04:08:35.189
Something you had noticed a little bit in the body
of the old man before, but you didn't know if it

04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:37.941
was decomposition or just general dirt.

04:08:37.941 --> 04:08:41.083
TALIESIN: Girls, we're not supposed to be here.
Can you help us handle this?

04:08:41.083 --> 04:08:44.284
MATT: You watch as the two halflings are like,
"Fuck no!"

04:08:46.635 --> 04:08:52.109
TALIESIN: (sighs) We'll do what we can. If
something goes wrong, nudity usually works.

04:08:52.109 --> 04:08:57.299
[laughing]

04:08:57.299 --> 04:09:03.752
MATT: The two mutated guards now, their armor
bulging and broken in places, turn to the noises

04:09:03.783 --> 04:09:05.713
in the tent where you guys are.

04:09:05.713 --> 04:09:08.212
SAM: Are we in the same tent or are we in two
different tents?

04:09:08.212 --> 04:09:11.719
MATT: You guys are all in one tent with the other
girls. You are all jammed into the space. The two

04:09:11.719 --> 04:09:17.510
of you make your way outside of the large tent as
you watch these two bulging, zombified creatures

04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:21.387
making their way towards the tent. And that's
where we're going to pick up next time.

04:09:21.387 --> 04:09:23.497
(groaning)

04:09:23.497 --> 04:09:24.883
SAM: Bastard!

04:09:24.883 --> 04:09:26.869
MATT: Because it is 11 now.

04:09:26.869 --> 04:09:30.489
TRAVIS: But we're not supposed to be there! We're
gonna get framed for it!

04:09:30.649 --> 04:09:33.001
MARISHA: Exactly, we can't get framed!

04:09:33.001 --> 04:09:38.033
SAM: Can I just say, Laura and I busted the case
&lt;i&gt;wide open&lt;/i&gt;!

04:09:38.033 --> 04:09:40.345
(laughter)

04:09:40.345 --> 04:09:42.249
TRAVIS: That is true!

04:09:42.249 --> 04:09:48.561
SAM: We solved the case. Easy.

04:09:48.561 --> 04:09:49.951
LAURA: Totally.

04:09:49.951 --> 04:09:53.111
TALIESIN: Which one's Nancy, which one's Drew?

04:09:53.111 --> 04:09:55.092
SAM: Couple inquisitions. Couple little, uh--

04:09:55.092 --> 04:09:56.995
Following the clues.

04:09:56.995 --> 04:09:58.104
LAURA: That's right.

04:09:58.104 --> 04:10:00.263
TALIESIN: Just one more question.

04:10:00.263 --> 04:10:06.033
TRAVIS: When that demon frog leapt, how high and
how far, approximately, did it look like it went?

04:10:06.033 --> 04:10:11.956
MATT: It looks like it leapt about 20 to 25 feet
in the air and traveled about 40 feet with the

04:10:11.956 --> 04:10:13.641
leap. It was a large arc.

04:10:13.641 --> 04:10:15.776
LAURA: So we definitely can't fight that thing.

04:10:15.776 --> 04:10:16.702
TRAVIS: Sure we can.

04:10:16.702 --> 04:10:17.832
LAURA: Oh my god.

04:10:17.832 --> 04:10:20.088
TRAVIS: Oh god.

04:10:20.088 --> 04:10:22.548
MATT: You saw it escape northward from where you
are.

04:10:22.548 --> 04:10:24.893
MARISHA: And did it look like the same figure?

04:10:24.893 --> 04:10:32.463
MATT: Yasha ran north, northeast. This is just
straight north of where you are.

04:10:33.262 --> 04:10:35.569
Towards the Ustaloch.

04:10:35.569 --> 04:10:39.016
MARISHA: Towards Ustaloch! It's the fucking lake!

04:10:40.286 --> 04:10:42.636
[crosstalk]

04:10:42.636 --> 04:10:45.148
TRAVIS: Oh man, this is good, dude!

04:10:45.323 --> 04:10:54.960
MARISHA: See, here's my thing. Does anyone else
notice that the zombie transformations seem like a

04:10:54.960 --> 04:11:01.657
serpent shedding its skin? Because they always
slough off their skin?

04:11:01.657 --> 04:11:05.031
TRAVIS: It's also done without any contact.

04:11:05.031 --> 04:11:06.101
MARISHA: Wait, what?

04:11:06.101 --> 04:11:08.345
TRAVIS: It's done without any contact. He never
touches him.

04:11:08.345 --> 04:11:09.807
LAURA: Yeah, he touched him, didn't he?

04:11:09.807 --> 04:11:11.023
MATT: No.

04:11:11.023 --> 04:11:12.522
LAURA: I thought he did.

04:11:12.522 --> 04:11:15.322
MATT: No, they just suddenly began to erupt in--

04:11:15.322 --> 04:11:22.095
LAURA: Hey, bonus news, though. The charm spell
guy isn't going to turn me dead!

04:11:22.095 --> 04:11:25.131
MATT: Look at that silver lining!

04:11:25.131 --> 04:11:28.600
TALIESIN: This season got dark. Season got dark.

04:11:28.600 --> 04:11:31.348
LAURA: Whoa. Tight tight tight tight.

04:11:31.348 --> 04:11:34.950
TRAVIS: Good shit. Little damaged voice, fuck
yeah.

04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:36.367
MATT: That'll be fun.

04:11:36.367 --> 04:11:39.824
LAURA: I wanted to cough for her.

04:11:39.824 --> 04:11:45.731
MATT: We'll pick up there next week. The chase is
on, apparently. Thank you guys so much for being

04:11:45.731 --> 04:11:49.505
awesome. Thank you guys for coming along and
watching with us. We'll pick this up next Thursday

04:11:49.505 --> 04:11:55.935
where we left off, right in the middle of this
campsite. Until then, have a wonderful week. See

04:11:55.935 --> 04:11:58.796
you guys then. And, is it Thursday yet?

04:11:59.265 --> 04:12:01.129
Goodnight.

04:12:01.307 --> 04:12:08.449

00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:02.751
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

2
00:00:02.751 --> 00:00:03.999
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:05.502
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:07.581
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:09.261
LIAM: Whoops!

6
00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:10.251
(laughter)

7
00:00:10.251 --> 00:00:12.061
MATT: Just like that.

8
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:13.880
So yeah, before we jump into tonight's session,

9
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.571
let's go ahead and get through some of our announcements,

10
00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:18.781
beginning with our fantastic returning sponsor

11
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.129
for campaign two, D&amp;D Beyond. Sam!

12
00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.480
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond is our returning sponsor again this week.

13
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.761
We love them, you can check them out

14
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:29.543
at dndbeyond.link/criticalrole.

15
00:00:29.543 --> 00:00:31.522
They cheer us on every week.

16
00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:32.790
I thought,

17
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.514
why not cheer them on as well! (laughs)

18
00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.641
Watch Marisha die inside.

19
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.623
(laughter)

20
00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.722
MATT: She wasn't even in cheer squad,

21
00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:43.152
she was in dance.
SAM: Oh, I don't know.

22
00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:44.493
Okay, ready?
TRAVIS: There's a difference, bitch.

23
00:00:44.493 --> 00:00:45.326
SAM: Ready?

24
00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:46.764
Okay!

25
00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:48.097
D&amp;D!

26
00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:49.701
Beyond!

27
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:51.222
D&amp;D!

28
00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:52.834
Beyond!

29
00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.063
Table!

30
00:00:54.063 --> 00:00:55.674
On this side!

31
00:00:55.674 --> 00:00:56.723
Show me!

32
00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.303
Your D&amp;D pride!

33
00:00:58.303 --> 00:00:59.920
Yell D&amp;D!

34
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.586
Beyond!
TRAVIS: Beyond!

35
00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.052
SAM: D&amp;D!
TRAVIS: D&amp;D!

36
00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:04.660
SAM: Beyond!
TRAVIS: Beyond!

37
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.676
SAM: Table!

38
00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:07.087
On this side!

39
00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:08.917
(laughter)

40
00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:10.179
Please make!

41
00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:11.748
This ad die!

42
00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:14.221
(laughter)

43
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.149
Yeah!

44
00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.399
(laughter)

45
00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:20.301
MATT: Wow.

46
00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:23.367
Surprisingly succinct.

47
00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.507
LAURA: You should have been a cheerleader!

48
00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:26.465
TRAVIS: Is that a record?

49
00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:28.692
MATT: It might be, might be.

50
00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:30.461
LIAM: The pithiest D&amp;D Beyond spot.

51
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:32.075
LAURA: Yeah!
MARISHA: It was pretty good.

52
00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:33.701
MATT: Vying for one of the more violent ones.

53
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:34.909
SAM: Yes.
MATT: But not quite there.

54
00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.064
SAM: Sorry, sorry.

55
00:01:36.064 --> 00:01:37.272
TALIESIN: That mic is just going to

56
00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:39.536
keep vibrating for so long.

57
00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:41.906
(laughter)

58
00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:42.914
MATT: Perfect, thank you, Sam.

59
00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:44.172
SAM: Back to you, Matt.

60
00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:45.814
MATT: And thank you, D&amp;D Beyond

61
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:49.298
for many reasons, mainly your endurance.

62
00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:50.644
So let's get to the rest of our announcements,

63
00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:52.703
Travis, you got some things to talk about, I believe.

64
00:01:52.703 --> 00:01:54.164
TRAVIS: Ah, I do!

65
00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:56.175
Yes! For the month of November--

66
00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:58.819
(laughter)

67
00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.029
(stammering) Yes!

68
00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:01.660
MARISHA: Go first.

69
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.493
TRAVIS: The beverage.

70
00:02:02.493 --> 00:02:04.683
For the month of (stammering) November--

71
00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:06.108
(laughter)
Holy shit.

72
00:02:06.108 --> 00:02:07.679
Critical Role has partnered once again

73
00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.009
with one of our favorite charities, OSD.

74
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.016
ALL: Yeah!

75
00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:14.599
TRAVIS: They support active duty and civilian veterans

76
00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.458
that are various stages of their life,

77
00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:19.308
and they have currently served over one million members

78
00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:21.988
of the military and all their different branches,

79
00:02:21.988 --> 00:02:23.858
and we are glad to be a part of the next million

80
00:02:23.858 --> 00:02:24.988
that they will help.

81
00:02:24.988 --> 00:02:26.148
We have a month long push,

82
00:02:26.148 --> 00:02:28.308
so please consider donating or at least sharing the message

83
00:02:28.308 --> 00:02:30.138
and you can see all of that goodness

84
00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:35.138
and all the details and more at critrole.com/OSD.

85
00:02:35.278 --> 00:02:37.007
MARISHA: OSD!
MATT: Hell yeah.

86
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:37.967
Hold that thought, Travis.

87
00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:39.175
Marisha, you're up, go.

88
00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:42.446
MARISHA: Oh, I'll just move, jazz.

89
00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:45.160
(laughter)

90
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.816
MATT: It's fun to throw you off.

91
00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:50.268
MARISHA: On that note, in case you missed it, (laughs)

92
00:02:50.268 --> 00:02:52.538
earlier this week we made an announcement

93
00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:56.394
that we are going to push part four,

94
00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:59.146
the finale of UnDeadwood by one week

95
00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:02.546
to November 15th. That's not this Friday,

96
00:03:02.546 --> 00:03:04.803
not tomorrow, but the Friday after next.
TRAVIS: Got it.

97
00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:08.026
MARISHA: We had some technical difficulties in post,

98
00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:10.594
and a few very frustrating hurdles

99
00:03:10.594 --> 00:03:13.280
that we had to get over,

100
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.248
but we are good and back on track,

101
00:03:15.248 --> 00:03:18.022
but didn't want to destroy our team.

102
00:03:18.022 --> 00:03:19.967
SAM: Was it Brian's hair, is it Brian's hair,

103
00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:22.217
like, you had to CG it all?

104
00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:25.203
MARISHA: We-- oh!

105
00:03:25.203 --> 00:03:27.263
He's going to hate if I out him on this.

106
00:03:27.263 --> 00:03:28.704
TRAVIS: What, his hair product caught fire or what?

107
00:03:28.704 --> 00:03:29.887
SAM: Did you do something to his hair?

108
00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:32.865
MARISHA: He did get a haircut

109
00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:35.995
while we were reviewing the edit.

110
00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:38.985
He just had his girl come to our edit,

111
00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:39.818
so we can just--

112
00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:41.413
(laughter)

113
00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:42.552
I have pictures of it.

114
00:03:42.552 --> 00:03:43.853
Sorry, B!

115
00:03:43.853 --> 00:03:44.992
I'm so sorry!

116
00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.232
TALIESIN: Worth it, worth it.

117
00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:47.085
Burn it to the ground.

118
00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:48.315
LAURA: Amazing.

119
00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:49.156
TRAVIS: Artist's life.

120
00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:50.665
MARISHA: But that doesn't-- (laughs)

121
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:52.753
LAURA: That is such-- to do.

122
00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:55.136
SAM: Wow, Brian.
MARISHA: How hard we've been going on this, man.

123
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:58.801
Anyway.
LIAM: Got to stay fresh in the editing room.

124
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:00.746
MARISHA: It's true.

125
00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:01.579
It was good times.

126
00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.255
But yeah, tune in on the 15th,

127
00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:07.969
that's this next Friday, 7:00pm for part four

128
00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:12.312
of UnDeadwood. Promise you, it's crazy.

129
00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:14.694
MATT: It's a doozy.
MARISHA: It's fucking crazy.

130
00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:15.692
MATT: It's a doozy, it's fun.

131
00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:17.168
Travis, you're up.

132
00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:18.805
TRAVIS: Yeah, also earlier this week,

133
00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:22.808
we announced some pretty major news

134
00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:25.328
around our upcoming animated series,

135
00:04:25.328 --> 00:04:26.839
The Legend of Vox Machina.

136
00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:31.417
It's been picked up by (shouting) Amazon Prime Video!

137
00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:32.368
(normal voice) Which is huge,

138
00:04:32.368 --> 00:04:33.490
and because of that partnership,

139
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.463
we are able to create two additional episodes

140
00:04:35.463 --> 00:04:36.441
for the first season,

141
00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:40.223
so now 10 episodes has become 12 for season one,

142
00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:44.065
(shouting) and a second season of 12 episodes!

143
00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:46.193
24 total episodes!

144
00:04:46.193 --> 00:04:47.039
(laughter)

145
00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.233
Is this too big?

146
00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:50.278
Is this too big?
SAM: No, it's not too big.

147
00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:51.996
TRAVIS: I'm on fire!

148
00:04:51.996 --> 00:04:53.935
(normal voice) We're really excited.

149
00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:55.513
Yeah, it's been amazing.

150
00:04:55.513 --> 00:04:56.844
It was hard to keep under our hats.

151
00:04:56.844 --> 00:04:59.633
They've been amazing to work with.

152
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.231
We've also seen a few questions around

153
00:05:01.231 --> 00:05:02.730
whether the Kickstarter backers will still be able

154
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.260
to see the first season for free,

155
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.324
and the answer is yes, it is at the forefront of our mind.

156
00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:08.663
We wanted to make sure that everybody knows

157
00:05:08.663 --> 00:05:12.712
that backers will get access to the two-part special first,

158
00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:14.564
we are still working on how we do that,

159
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.303
but with all of our brain powers combined,

160
00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:18.953
it shall surely be an easily surmountable task.

161
00:05:18.953 --> 00:05:21.583
And you will get access to the first season for free.

162
00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:22.892
All of those details to come,

163
00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:25.924
and if you want to see where are the details are listed,

164
00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:28.153
you can head to our Kickstarter page,

165
00:05:28.153 --> 00:05:29.924
but I can tell you, we've been hard at work

166
00:05:29.924 --> 00:05:31.764
with all of our friends at Titmouse,

167
00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.175
already making this thing amazing, scripts are in,

168
00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:37.684
designs are in, location, background art is in.

169
00:05:37.684 --> 00:05:38.517
LAURA: It's so good!

170
00:05:38.517 --> 00:05:40.523
TRAVIS: It's so hard not to just like,

171
00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:42.213
should I just show them on my phone?

172
00:05:42.213 --> 00:05:43.866
(laughter)

173
00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:46.492
Okay. In due time, there will be a rollout.

174
00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:47.562
MATT: We will be, right?

175
00:05:47.562 --> 00:05:48.861
We will be rolling out some art pretty soon?

176
00:05:48.861 --> 00:05:50.592
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, we will actually be doing it

177
00:05:50.592 --> 00:05:52.323
in very nice and exciting ways,

178
00:05:52.323 --> 00:05:55.720
but holy fuck, you guys, it's real.

179
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.431
And we are super, super excited.

180
00:05:57.431 --> 00:05:59.253
So thank you again to Amazon Prime Video,

181
00:05:59.253 --> 00:06:00.735
thank you again to our partners at Titmouse.

182
00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.471
SAM: Thank you to the backers for making this--

183
00:06:02.471 --> 00:06:03.862
LAURA: Yes, oh yes!

184
00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:04.695
Thank you!

185
00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:07.173
MATT: We're going to make this as amazing as we possibly can

186
00:06:07.173 --> 00:06:08.006
for you guys.

187
00:06:08.006 --> 00:06:09.504
It's going to be great.

188
00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:11.093
TRAVIS: Yeah!

189
00:06:11.093 --> 00:06:13.563
MATT: Thank you, Travis. (laughs)

190
00:06:13.563 --> 00:06:14.962
Laura, you got some updates, I believe.

191
00:06:14.962 --> 00:06:15.956
LAURA: Well, yeah!

192
00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:17.464
It's not as cool as all of that,

193
00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:19.738
but it's still pretty cool!
MATT: I disagree!

194
00:06:19.738 --> 00:06:22.213
LAURA: So number one!

195
00:06:22.213 --> 00:06:24.070
Merch in the store, it's all merch in the store,

196
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.968
but number one is the finishing of our collection

197
00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:29.006
of our Mighty Nein chibis!

198
00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:30.070
SAM: Aw, they're so cute!

199
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.891
LAURA: So there's Fjord and there's Nott,

200
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:35.009
and there's Molly.
TALIESIN: I love that Molly.

201
00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:35.842
TRAVIS: Love it.

202
00:06:35.842 --> 00:06:38.096
LAURA: I love the backgrounds. I don't know

203
00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:39.407
which one is my favorite,

204
00:06:39.407 --> 00:06:41.370
it's-- they're all so amazing.

205
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.559
The pins were designed by our beautiful friend,

206
00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.758
Jenny Park, who is phenomenal,

207
00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:49.140
and thank you, thank you, thank you for that, Jenny.

208
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.856
And so they're in the store now.

209
00:06:50.856 --> 00:06:52.557
Also!

210
00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:53.477
I have to back up for this,

211
00:06:53.477 --> 00:06:54.977
because this is sitting in my lap.

212
00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:57.395
Keeping me so warm and toasty!

213
00:06:57.395 --> 00:06:58.728
SAM: I'm actually cold right now!

214
00:06:58.728 --> 00:07:01.027
LAURA: Oh, you can have this on during the show.

215
00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:04.166
This is our blanket, it's so incredibly soft,

216
00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:06.157
it's the map by Deven Rue,

217
00:07:06.157 --> 00:07:09.835
and I love it, and I'm just so happy that we got this made.

218
00:07:09.835 --> 00:07:10.898
TRAVIS: Is that Verona?

219
00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:12.010
LAURA: And yes!

220
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.221
SAM: It's a blanket, it's a map.
LAURA: I've stolen many already.

221
00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:15.728
SAM: It's a blap.

222
00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:18.062
LAURA: Here, do you want to snuggle up in it?

223
00:07:18.062 --> 00:07:19.045
Feel how soft it is.

224
00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:21.028
LIAM: It is the softest.
SAM: Mm!

225
00:07:21.028 --> 00:07:23.144
Smells like Tal'Dorei.

226
00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:24.895
LAURA: (laughs)

227
00:07:24.895 --> 00:07:26.048
MATT: Legitimately fell asleep wrapped in that

228
00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:28.125
when we finished Barry season two.

229
00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:29.101
TALIESIN: Yeah.

230
00:07:29.101 --> 00:07:32.287
MATT: It's pretty awesome, it's pretty comfy.

231
00:07:32.287 --> 00:07:34.223
LAURA: I'm just excited we get to make this stuff, you guys.

232
00:07:34.223 --> 00:07:35.882
SAM: I can do anything under here.

233
00:07:35.882 --> 00:07:37.032
(laughter)

234
00:07:37.032 --> 00:07:38.123
MARISHA: Oh.

235
00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:40.115
TRAVIS: Okay, all right.

236
00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:42.621
MATT: You can do anything through the hole in the sheet.

237
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:44.709
TALIESIN: Anything we make is mostly so we get one.

238
00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:45.661
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty nice!

239
00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:47.556
MATT: Essentially our whole merch plan

240
00:07:47.556 --> 00:07:49.105
is just make stuff we want to have.

241
00:07:49.105 --> 00:07:50.380
LAURA: Yes!
MATT: And hopefully you guys want them.

242
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.868
LIAM: I have one of everything in my home office.

243
00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:54.832
I'm running out of room, so slow down!

244
00:07:54.832 --> 00:07:56.405
(laughter)

245
00:07:56.405 --> 00:07:57.942
MATT: All right, thank you so much, Laura.

246
00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:00.167
LAURA: I've been given freedom and I love it!

247
00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:01.490
(laughter)

248
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.272
MATT: You're good at what you do.

249
00:08:03.272 --> 00:08:04.172
All right, then.

250
00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:06.027
I think that concludes our announcements.

251
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:07.417
First time that I didn't actually have

252
00:08:07.417 --> 00:08:09.887
to make any announcements myself, which was nice,

253
00:08:09.887 --> 00:08:11.996
that's why I got to fuck with you guys!

254
00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:13.125
But on that note,

255
00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:16.273
let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of

256
00:08:16.273 --> 00:08:17.632
Critical Role.

257
00:08:19.727 --> 00:08:23.017

258
00:08:23.017 --> 00:08:26.983

LAURA: I missed!
MATT: And welcome back.

292
00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:00.806
(sighs) Children.

293
00:10:00.806 --> 00:10:02.731
TALIESIN: Yes.
MATT: So.

294
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:05.213
Last we left off,

295
00:10:05.213 --> 00:10:06.651
The Mighty Nein,

296
00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:09.418
in search of their allies in the coming struggle

297
00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:12.219
that seemed to be slowly building around Obann,

298
00:10:12.219 --> 00:10:13.877
and the plans that he's making in pursuit of

299
00:10:13.877 --> 00:10:16.919
the will of the Angel of Irons,

300
00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:18.475
you went to find Yussa,

301
00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:20.548
the mage of Tide Peak Tower in Nicodranas,

302
00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:22.787
had vanished into the Folding Halls of Halas,

303
00:10:22.787 --> 00:10:24.155
the Archmage Bane,

304
00:10:24.155 --> 00:10:26.995
the Heirloom Sphere, or as you guys refer to it

305
00:10:26.995 --> 00:10:30.233
as the Happy Fucking Fun Ball.

306
00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:34.504
After spending what was essentially weeks and weeks

307
00:10:34.504 --> 00:10:37.195
of real time, and just for a few days within the ball's

308
00:10:37.195 --> 00:10:39.606
strange time dilation, you manage to make your way

309
00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:42.264
through all sorts of strange chambers and traps

310
00:10:42.264 --> 00:10:45.174
and battle mage-hunter golems, and then eventually

311
00:10:45.174 --> 00:10:50.174
find your way to a lost den of Halas,

312
00:10:50.254 --> 00:10:52.902
the creator of these Halls, who had found his soul

313
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.260
locked within some sort of a

314
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.735
trapped or sabotaged relic,

315
00:10:58.735 --> 00:11:01.174
of which he was using in his research.

316
00:11:01.174 --> 00:11:02.901
Acquiring this gem, questioning him,

317
00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:05.444
and making an alliance to a certain degree

318
00:11:05.444 --> 00:11:10.073
to gain guidance out of this strange sequence of rooms,

319
00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:12.233
you manage to find yourself to the Prison of Soot.

320
00:11:12.233 --> 00:11:15.231
You freed Yussa, who had been silenced and put away

321
00:11:15.231 --> 00:11:16.860
as he began to peruse the interior

322
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.484
of these Halls on his own.

323
00:11:18.484 --> 00:11:19.691
You all managed to escape,

324
00:11:19.691 --> 00:11:22.470
and found yourself outside of the sphere,

325
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.577
partway up Tide Peak Tower.

326
00:11:24.577 --> 00:11:27.697
Along with Allura Vysoren from the Council of Tal'Dorei,

327
00:11:27.697 --> 00:11:32.570
who had aided you as a friend through this small adventure.

328
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.799
And now as you all gathered, her research had brought her

329
00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:38.498
to ask information, and to bring materials and thoughts

330
00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:41.127
and imagery, memories of this individual, Yasha,

331
00:11:41.127 --> 00:11:43.447
of which you spoke of, that seemed to be involved

332
00:11:43.447 --> 00:11:45.636
in this mess with Obann.

333
00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:48.206
As you gathered hands to gather and prepare the ritual,

334
00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:51.425
you peered past the veil of deceit,

335
00:11:51.425 --> 00:11:53.986
and revealed the Angel of Irons

336
00:11:53.986 --> 00:11:57.196
seems to have been a cover,

337
00:11:57.196 --> 00:12:01.116
some sort of a possibly fictional name,

338
00:12:01.116 --> 00:12:04.095
an entity to mask the true intent

339
00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:07.095
of one Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion,

340
00:12:07.095 --> 00:12:09.575
who has been seemingly amassing allies

341
00:12:09.575 --> 00:12:12.926
under the guise of the Angel of Irons,

342
00:12:12.926 --> 00:12:15.308
to what end?

343
00:12:15.308 --> 00:12:17.338
We do not know, necessarily.

344
00:12:17.338 --> 00:12:19.421
But upon this revelation,

345
00:12:20.487 --> 00:12:25.487
we return to the chamber, partway up Tide Peak Tower.

346
00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:27.929
As Allura finishes saying to herself,

347
00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:30.648
"I must inform the council,"

348
00:12:30.648 --> 00:12:32.518
there's a long, pregnant pause,

349
00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.100
the air itself is still.

350
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.948
You can smell the salty, sea air that comes in

351
00:12:36.948 --> 00:12:41.856
from the nearby docks and Ocean of Lucidian nearby.

352
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:45.591
But amongst that is just this sense of dread

353
00:12:45.591 --> 00:12:49.122
and weight on your shoulders as the sheer volume and gravity

354
00:12:49.122 --> 00:12:51.930
of what you've all recently heard

355
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.930
comes to take your mind.

356
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:59.970
SAM: Is that a thing that's happening right now?

357
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.882
MATT: You guys are now, you're in the tower.

358
00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:04.135
You're reacting to the ritual, what would you like to do?

359
00:13:04.135 --> 00:13:04.968
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

360
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:11.631
SAM: Tharizdun, Tharizdun!

361
00:13:11.631 --> 00:13:15.620
I think, I feel like we need to practice saying it.

362
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.453
MARISHA: Tharezdun.

363
00:13:16.453 --> 00:13:17.696
SAM: Tharezdun?
MARISHA: Tharezdun.

364
00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:18.854
TRAVIS: Where's the emphásis?

365
00:13:18.854 --> 00:13:19.973
SAM: Yeah, where is the emphasis?

366
00:13:19.973 --> 00:13:21.608
LAURA: Know about him?

367
00:13:21.608 --> 00:13:23.981
MARISHA: We've been talking about him,
he's come up a few times.

368
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:27.360
LAURA: Yeah, but he's super powerful.

369
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.269
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:13:30.929 --> 00:13:31.962
SAM: Yeah.

371
00:13:34.318 --> 00:13:36.332
TRAVIS: He's also a Betrayer God.

372
00:13:36.332 --> 00:13:39.792
He's like, crazy, crazy old, right?

373
00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:40.884
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

374
00:13:40.884 --> 00:13:43.483
SAM: You think we can take him, because he's real old?

375
00:13:43.483 --> 00:13:46.513
MATT: If someone wishes to make a religion check.

376
00:13:46.513 --> 00:13:47.463
MARISHA: Me!

377
00:13:47.463 --> 00:13:48.870
MATT: All right.

378
00:13:50.407 --> 00:13:51.722
MARISHA: Okay.

379
00:13:51.722 --> 00:13:53.718
What is that?

380
00:13:53.718 --> 00:13:54.551
23.

381
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:56.560
MATT: 23? Okay.

382
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.701
Good to know.
TRAVIS: There it is.

383
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:00.983
MARISHA: Yeah. Not too bad, not too bad.

384
00:14:00.983 --> 00:14:05.983
MATT: As part of this conversation, you do know that

385
00:14:06.224 --> 00:14:09.306
Tharizdun as an entity,

386
00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:12.168
while categorized as a Betrayer God,

387
00:14:12.168 --> 00:14:14.867
does not belong necessarily or stemmed from

388
00:14:14.867 --> 00:14:18.658
the same Founding Entities that the other

389
00:14:18.658 --> 00:14:20.438
Elements of Divinity stem from.

390
00:14:20.438 --> 00:14:21.747
While it is lumped with it,

391
00:14:21.747 --> 00:14:23.717
it is something other entirely,

392
00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:27.793
possibly older in the world, no one knows.

393
00:14:27.793 --> 00:14:28.942
TRAVIS: Cool.

394
00:14:28.942 --> 00:14:31.115
MATT: It is strange, it is aberrant,

395
00:14:31.115 --> 00:14:33.311
and it is--
MARISHA: Cosmic horror shit.

396
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:36.761
MATT: It is very much that.
MARISHA: Some old god shit.

397
00:14:38.075 --> 00:14:41.555
SAM: Do we know, does anyone, do any of us know

398
00:14:42.463 --> 00:14:47.463
what separates Tharizdun from our plane of existence?

399
00:14:47.537 --> 00:14:49.521
Is there a gate or a--

400
00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:52.216
MATT: Because of your religion check you do.

401
00:14:52.216 --> 00:14:57.216
As Allura leans forward and goes,

402
00:14:57.633 --> 00:15:00.787
"Yussa, we need to research how this entity

403
00:15:00.787 --> 00:15:04.170
"was put away, was sealed.

404
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.955
"Where does it exist?"

405
00:15:06.955 --> 00:15:10.557
You at this question pop up and recall a couple of things.

406
00:15:10.557 --> 00:15:15.557
One, you know it was sealed once

407
00:15:15.717 --> 00:15:17.176
long ago in the Founding,

408
00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:20.186
back when the deities first began to give form

409
00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:22.237
to the world after the defeating and scattering

410
00:15:22.237 --> 00:15:25.157
of the Primal Elementals that previously

411
00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:29.346
walked across Exandria in its early days.

412
00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:31.686
They had thought to have banished Tharizdun,

413
00:15:31.686 --> 00:15:34.278
and then he returned during the Calamity.

414
00:15:34.278 --> 00:15:37.944
In that time period, Ioun and Pelor

415
00:15:37.944 --> 00:15:41.285
spearheaded the assault against the roiling, hungry,

416
00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:43.719
black void that was the entity.

417
00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:45.719
MARISHA: Right, right before--
LAURA: The nothing!

418
00:15:45.719 --> 00:15:47.386
MATT: They banished him,

419
00:15:48.703 --> 00:15:52.223
but the struggle left Ioun with a terrible wound

420
00:15:52.223 --> 00:15:53.120
that would not heal.

421
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.390
LAURA: Oh!

422
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.927
MARISHA: Forever.

423
00:15:55.927 --> 00:16:00.885
MATT: For as long as Tharizdun exists,
it seems the wound exists.

424
00:16:00.885 --> 00:16:04.583
It is said, because you've rolled so high on religion--

425
00:16:04.583 --> 00:16:07.057
MARISHA: In the volcano, right?

426
00:16:07.057 --> 00:16:08.298
I don't remember where we learned that.

427
00:16:08.298 --> 00:16:09.131
MATT: No.

428
00:16:09.131 --> 00:16:10.967
MARISHA: Sorry, keep going.
MATT: It's okay.

429
00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:13.166
It is also said that multiple sets of divine shackles

430
00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:17.349
hold the Chained Oblivion at the bottom of the Abyss,

431
00:16:17.349 --> 00:16:20.917
their power anchored somewhere in Exandria.

432
00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:23.134
SAM: (whispering) Shackles!

433
00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:26.561
MATT: And you rolled what on a religion check?

434
00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:27.394
MARISHA: 23.

435
00:16:27.394 --> 00:16:28.950
MATT: 23, okay, that's all you know.

436
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.950
LIAM: I have a question of story.

437
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.950
Is this beyond-- everyone knows what the Calamity is.

438
00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:40.449
Is this beyond common knowledge,

439
00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:43.540
the existence of Tharizdun?

440
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.809
This is something that only people with esoteric knowledge

441
00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:47.769
or vast amounts of study know?

442
00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:49.180
MATT: People know of it in the way

443
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.478
that people know about the boogeyman.

444
00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:53.230
Tharizdun would be the equivalent of the boogeyman,

445
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.017
colloquially in most cultures,

446
00:16:55.017 --> 00:16:56.409
people might say, you know, be careful,

447
00:16:56.409 --> 00:16:58.580
Chained Oblivion will get you if you don't go to bed early.

448
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.365
But it's been so long ago...

449
00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:03.999
A lot of people may not really--

450
00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:07.486
History that old, that has been altered and rewritten

451
00:17:07.486 --> 00:17:09.761
based on whoever's in power in those locations,

452
00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:13.769
and certain interpretations can shift from place to place.

453
00:17:13.769 --> 00:17:16.617
Many people who are of some level of intellectual knowledge

454
00:17:16.617 --> 00:17:20.319
and training acknowledge that it existed,

455
00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.969
but as it is with a lot of mortal entities

456
00:17:22.969 --> 00:17:25.438
that are so caught up with their own day-to-day business,

457
00:17:25.438 --> 00:17:27.137
it seems that something so far off--

458
00:17:27.137 --> 00:17:30.318
LIAM: So it's older and weirder than us knowing stories

459
00:17:30.318 --> 00:17:33.158
of Zeus turning into a bull and, you know, stuff like that.

460
00:17:33.158 --> 00:17:34.199
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Stranger than that.

461
00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:35.032
MATT: Correct.

462
00:17:35.032 --> 00:17:36.840
TRAVIS: It wounded Ioun, and the wound didn't heal.

463
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.260
This thing's like Mike Tyson at the end of Punch Out!

464
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.810
Nobody wants to fight this.

465
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.453
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

466
00:17:42.453 --> 00:17:43.983
You're going to go down with one hit!
TALIESIN: It's like Hercules Mulligan.

467
00:17:43.983 --> 00:17:45.494
Name's too weird to be real.

468
00:17:45.494 --> 00:17:46.332
(laughter)

469
00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:47.953
MATT: Yussa pipes up and goes,

470
00:17:47.953 --> 00:17:49.336
"Ah, well.

471
00:17:50.982 --> 00:17:53.010
"Who do we know who belongs to this cult,

472
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.941
"if there is. If this who all who you are chasing,

473
00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:58.982
"who you are after, who do we know

474
00:17:58.982 --> 00:18:01.622
"is connected to this entity?"

475
00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:02.942
SAM: We know a few folks.

476
00:18:02.942 --> 00:18:05.713
TALIESIN: We have a running list.

477
00:18:05.713 --> 00:18:06.593
LAURA: Yeah.

478
00:18:06.593 --> 00:18:08.591
One is Obann, Obann.

479
00:18:08.591 --> 00:18:09.734
SAM: Yeah, he's a demon.

480
00:18:09.734 --> 00:18:10.673
LAURA: Yeah.

481
00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:11.993
SAM: Demon, devil?

482
00:18:11.993 --> 00:18:12.826
TALIESIN: Devil.

483
00:18:12.826 --> 00:18:15.117
SAM: Devil?
LIAM, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Devil.

484
00:18:15.117 --> 00:18:16.589
SAM: He's Obann.

485
00:18:16.589 --> 00:18:17.790
LAURA: He's got wings.

486
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.980
SAM: Mm-hmm, he can make himself look like other people.

487
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.871
LAURA: Yeah, and he's really good at manipulating people.

488
00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:27.690
So he has control of our friend Yasha, right?

489
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.523
MATT: "Right."

490
00:18:28.523 --> 00:18:30.730
LAURA: And when I was looking at them through scrying,

491
00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.498
you know what that is?

492
00:18:32.498 --> 00:18:33.871
SAM: (laughs)

493
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:36.119
LAURA: When I was looking at them,

494
00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:37.637
she was trying to fight him, right?

495
00:18:37.637 --> 00:18:39.448
And she was like, "I don't want to be with you!"

496
00:18:39.448 --> 00:18:43.569
And the storm god was like, oh, almost took control,

497
00:18:43.569 --> 00:18:47.506
and then Obann touched her chin and something happened,

498
00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:50.689
and she was instantly back to being under his control.

499
00:18:50.689 --> 00:18:52.940
And she's got a thing on the back of her neck!

500
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.239
SAM: But she might have also been evil the whole time,

501
00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:56.948
and just sort of, we didn't know that.

502
00:18:56.948 --> 00:18:57.781
LAURA: I don't think so.

503
00:18:57.781 --> 00:18:59.740
MATT: "What is this thing on the back of the neck, you say?"

504
00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.260
LAURA: It is like, and I describe it,

505
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.860
exactly like I saw it.

506
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.426
MATT: What you saw, it looked, the faint orange glow

507
00:19:07.426 --> 00:19:11.268
reminiscent of the old car cigarette lighters,

508
00:19:11.268 --> 00:19:12.929
that faint reddish--

509
00:19:12.929 --> 00:19:15.262
LAURA: Yeah, yeah!
MATT: -- heated tint to it.

510
00:19:15.262 --> 00:19:18.860
Very, very difficult to see.

511
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.135
Right at the base of the neck, underneath the hair.

512
00:19:21.135 --> 00:19:22.714
LAURA: Lots of little circles.

513
00:19:22.714 --> 00:19:23.547
MATT: Right.

514
00:19:23.547 --> 00:19:25.081
Well, sure.

515
00:19:26.644 --> 00:19:29.903
But Yussa contemplates after what you say and goes,

516
00:19:29.903 --> 00:19:31.603
"If this Obann is able to

517
00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:36.595
"continue to control your ally,

518
00:19:37.952 --> 00:19:40.152
"is this by the same means, or are the others

519
00:19:40.152 --> 00:19:43.035
"as to why he's able to bind
the champions of other betrayers

520
00:19:43.035 --> 00:19:44.869
"to his will as well?"

521
00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:46.686
LAURA: Maybe.

522
00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:50.002
Oh, I did see the light coming from the Laughing Hand,

523
00:19:50.002 --> 00:19:52.122
I think, didn't I?

524
00:19:52.122 --> 00:19:54.198
Yes, I did.
MATT: "If that is the case,

525
00:19:54.198 --> 00:19:57.156
"this Obann is a dangerous entity.

526
00:19:57.156 --> 00:20:00.395
"Because if the Laughing Hand is a champion of Torog,

527
00:20:00.395 --> 00:20:03.224
"and this other one that you had mentioned--"

528
00:20:03.224 --> 00:20:05.702
LAURA: The Inevitable End.

529
00:20:05.702 --> 00:20:07.761
LIAM: Jourrael, the Caedogeist.

530
00:20:07.761 --> 00:20:11.844
MATT: "The Caedogeist, as you said, yes, is born from,

531
00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:15.361
"was it Asmodeus and--?"

532
00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:19.340
SAM: Beauregard knows.
LIAM: Lolth.

533
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.409
MATT: "Of Lolth and Asmodeus.

534
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:24.599
"There is no reason for these things to follow

535
00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:28.174
"the intent of such a creature

536
00:20:28.174 --> 00:20:32.948
"of madness and disparate will as Tharizdun."

537
00:20:32.948 --> 00:20:35.199
LAURA: And we killed him and he instantly came back.

538
00:20:35.199 --> 00:20:36.032
MATT: "So.

539
00:20:37.388 --> 00:20:39.999
"You need to be mindful of what it is

540
00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:41.460
"that affects your friend

541
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.780
"might also be affecting these other creatures,

542
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.613
"these other champions."

543
00:20:46.889 --> 00:20:50.281
Allura turns the head over to Yussa.

544
00:20:50.281 --> 00:20:54.052
"Are they even aware they're worshiping this thing?

545
00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:55.572
"If they follow the Angel of Irons,

546
00:20:55.572 --> 00:20:57.071
"is that just their own cover?

547
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:59.942
"Or have they themselves been duped into believing...

548
00:20:59.942 --> 00:21:01.929
"It is rare for something of sound mind

549
00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:03.921
"to want to follow such utter destruction

550
00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:06.284
"of the planes and beyond."

551
00:21:06.284 --> 00:21:08.793
MARISHA: Yasha had amnesia.

552
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.550
She didn't remember her past,

553
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.772
ever since we met her.

554
00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:17.522
Maybe they all once were conscious followers,

555
00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.001
and something happened.

556
00:21:20.001 --> 00:21:21.834
Or maybe it was always

557
00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:24.561
manipulation.

558
00:21:24.561 --> 00:21:26.481
TRAVIS: Well, if Obann is a devil,

559
00:21:26.481 --> 00:21:29.348
and he's from the...Hells?

560
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.550
It can be that he's working on executing

561
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:39.183
the orders of a devil prince? A king,?

562
00:21:39.183 --> 00:21:41.798
Someone from hell is trying to--

563
00:21:41.798 --> 00:21:43.598
MARISHA: They like their hierarchy.

564
00:21:43.598 --> 00:21:45.335
MATT: "Tharizdun is one of the entities

565
00:21:45.335 --> 00:21:47.917
"that resides at the bottom of the Abyss,

566
00:21:47.917 --> 00:21:51.886
"which is more of the demonic heritage."

567
00:21:51.886 --> 00:21:53.606
LAURA: That's weird, then.

568
00:21:53.606 --> 00:21:55.553
MATT: "There's a lot of mixed up factions here,

569
00:21:55.553 --> 00:21:58.017
"which is why I wonder."

570
00:21:58.017 --> 00:21:59.326
And you actually, because you rolled

571
00:21:59.326 --> 00:22:02.406
so fucking high on religion,

572
00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:03.497
regarding Tharizdun--

573
00:22:03.497 --> 00:22:04.772
MARISHA: It's my circlet.

574
00:22:04.772 --> 00:22:06.846
(laughter)

575
00:22:06.846 --> 00:22:08.636
MATT: Those who are foolhardy enough to follow

576
00:22:08.636 --> 00:22:11.046
such twisting destruction as the Chained Oblivion

577
00:22:11.046 --> 00:22:14.356
are often spurned, hateful, and chaotic souls

578
00:22:14.356 --> 00:22:17.834
who fall through the cracks of society and attention.

579
00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:19.537
A bit of inherent madness left unchecked

580
00:22:19.537 --> 00:22:22.114
opens the door to the creeping void

581
00:22:22.114 --> 00:22:24.636
that draws those who worship and come to the altar

582
00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:27.584
of this unspoken entity.

583
00:22:27.584 --> 00:22:29.783
You also know, since it is rare for those of sound mind

584
00:22:29.783 --> 00:22:32.956
to worship an entity that
brings only madness and destruction,

585
00:22:32.956 --> 00:22:33.789
the Chained Oblivion and his followers

586
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:37.236
often deceive sects into aiding their efforts

587
00:22:37.236 --> 00:22:39.204
from within other sects of worship,

588
00:22:39.204 --> 00:22:41.787
creating a false idol entirely.

589
00:22:42.854 --> 00:22:46.395
And you know that the higher acolytes of Tharizdun,

590
00:22:46.395 --> 00:22:48.334
as part of their ritual of ascension

591
00:22:48.334 --> 00:22:50.093
and to show their true faith,

592
00:22:50.093 --> 00:22:51.894
often remove their eyes so they can peer

593
00:22:51.894 --> 00:22:54.430
through shadow and light with his boon.

594
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.088
SAM: Ew!

595
00:22:56.088 --> 00:22:58.444
TALIESIN: Inconvenient.
TRAVIS: I don't want to play anymore, I'm leaving now.

596
00:22:58.444 --> 00:22:59.519
(laughter)

597
00:22:59.519 --> 00:23:03.030
TRAVIS: Taking a fishing boat--
MARISHA: Nope. I grab Fjord.

598
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.590
TALIESIN: Well, there's also, I mean,

599
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.001
they're connected to this larger conspiracy

600
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:10.230
within the war and factions within it,

601
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.022
so god only knows how deep this runs

602
00:23:13.022 --> 00:23:14.862
and how many people are involved.

603
00:23:14.862 --> 00:23:18.362
MARISHA: Well once again, if they're attracted to

604
00:23:19.361 --> 00:23:23.407
fractured people that they could easily manipulate--

605
00:23:23.407 --> 00:23:25.582
TALIESIN: This is the same cult that's been

606
00:23:25.582 --> 00:23:27.597
pushing warfare on the--

607
00:23:27.597 --> 00:23:31.869
LIAM: We know that Obann was referencing this individual

608
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:34.279
who is within the Empire, high up.

609
00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:35.657
LAURA: Yeah, the blond guy.

610
00:23:35.657 --> 00:23:36.930
What's his name again?

611
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.049
MARISHA: Oh, what was his fucking name?

612
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:40.029
TALIESIN: I like Blondie.

613
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:41.349
MARISHA: Oh, wait, Blondie?

614
00:23:41.349 --> 00:23:43.107
Vence Nuthaleus.

615
00:23:43.107 --> 00:23:44.029
TALIESIN: Yeah.

616
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:45.866
MATT: Yussa leans forward. "You showed and told me

617
00:23:45.866 --> 00:23:48.936
"about this device that was opening rifts."

618
00:23:48.936 --> 00:23:49.769
LAURA: Yeah!

619
00:23:49.769 --> 00:23:51.093
MATT: "Across--"
SAM: Yeah.

620
00:23:51.093 --> 00:23:53.197
MATT: "And was opening rifts to, you were saying?"

621
00:23:53.197 --> 00:23:54.030
SAM: The Abyss.

622
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:54.863
MATT: "The Abyss."

623
00:23:54.863 --> 00:23:56.054
SAM: Yes.
MARISHA: Yeah.

624
00:23:57.176 --> 00:24:01.636
MATT: "(sighs) What purpose do these rifts possibly have

625
00:24:01.636 --> 00:24:03.376
"in this larger plan?"

626
00:24:03.376 --> 00:24:04.959
MARISHA: They seem to have

627
00:24:06.247 --> 00:24:10.206
infantry, monsters, beasts that they were sending through.

628
00:24:10.206 --> 00:24:12.839
LAURA: I wonder if their location had something,

629
00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:15.721
if it was a greater network?

630
00:24:15.721 --> 00:24:17.710
SAM: They seemed randomly placed, remember?

631
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.328
They're somewhere in the backs of caves

632
00:24:19.328 --> 00:24:21.459
and weird mountains and stuff like that.

633
00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:23.542
TRAVIS: Bottom of a well.

634
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:25.809
SAM: Under a livery?

635
00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:27.175
TALIESIN: If you're poking holes in a bucket,

636
00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:29.320
it doesn't matter where the hole is.

637
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.845
Just how many.

638
00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:32.982
MATT: Both of you can make intelligence checks,

639
00:24:32.982 --> 00:24:35.509
because you're the two with highest intellect.

640
00:24:35.509 --> 00:24:36.599
SAM: I beg your pardon.

641
00:24:36.599 --> 00:24:38.398
MATT: As of now, yeah.

642
00:24:38.398 --> 00:24:39.231
LAURA: Okay.

643
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:40.341
TRAVIS: I'll have you know I rolled two.

644
00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:41.198
MARISHA: Just straight intellect?

645
00:24:41.198 --> 00:24:43.330
MATT: Yep, with your intelligence modifier.

646
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.330
MARISHA: 15.

647
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:46.334
LIAM: 18.

648
00:24:47.221 --> 00:24:48.054
MATT: All right.

649
00:24:48.054 --> 00:24:50.182
Caleb, upon hearing this conversation,

650
00:24:50.182 --> 00:24:54.082
you begin to recall your

651
00:24:54.082 --> 00:24:57.871
studying of interplanar effects and how

652
00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:01.690
the veils between planes can shift and thicken and wane.

653
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:05.880
As such, different events through the

654
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.333
actual calendar year occur and such.

655
00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:12.073
You do know, based on

656
00:25:12.073 --> 00:25:13.873
probably putting the pieces together,

657
00:25:13.873 --> 00:25:17.426
that with each rift that probably opens within Exandria,

658
00:25:17.426 --> 00:25:18.735
between that and the Abyss,

659
00:25:18.735 --> 00:25:22.245
the veils between the realms gets slightly weaker

660
00:25:22.245 --> 00:25:24.133
with each one that remains.

661
00:25:24.133 --> 00:25:25.383
If temporarily.

662
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.215
And through this, subtle influence of the Chained Oblivion

663
00:25:30.215 --> 00:25:32.769
may begin to creep into the world.

664
00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:36.287
LIAM: It's like if you have a leather strap

665
00:25:36.287 --> 00:25:39.745
and you punch enough holes it'll eventually--

666
00:25:39.745 --> 00:25:42.315
TALIESIN: That's one way to put it, sure.

667
00:25:42.315 --> 00:25:44.786
MATT: And because you rolled so high on religion,

668
00:25:44.786 --> 00:25:46.946
you also do know that the--

669
00:25:46.946 --> 00:25:48.106
MARISHA: I also know that.

670
00:25:48.106 --> 00:25:50.407
(laughter)

671
00:25:50.407 --> 00:25:53.805
MATT: The characteristics of the
Chained Oblivion's influence,

672
00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:57.315
the madness that it instills subtly,

673
00:25:57.315 --> 00:25:59.977
is said to slowly corrupt people with bouts

674
00:25:59.977 --> 00:26:04.325
of uncontrollable hunger, uncharacteristic aggression,

675
00:26:04.325 --> 00:26:06.742
and eventually violent mania.

676
00:26:08.637 --> 00:26:11.247
TRAVIS: Who wants to join that fishing boat with me?

677
00:26:11.247 --> 00:26:12.357
Anyone?

678
00:26:12.357 --> 00:26:13.961
The mackerel's biting this time of year.

679
00:26:13.961 --> 00:26:16.688
SAM: Hunger, what else?
MATT: Uncharacteristic aggression.

680
00:26:16.688 --> 00:26:18.821
TALIESIN: We think the Chained Oblivion's on a fishing boat?

681
00:26:18.821 --> 00:26:20.321
Under the water!

682
00:26:21.287 --> 00:26:24.047
Yeah, it's really clever.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

683
00:26:24.047 --> 00:26:25.417
MARISHA: I mean, I've been saying for a while

684
00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:28.967
that there's been recurring themes of hunger

685
00:26:28.967 --> 00:26:32.647
and famine and starvation and chains

686
00:26:32.647 --> 00:26:34.217
the entire time we've known each other.

687
00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:36.646
LAURA: Yeah, but who's been hungry other than me and stuff?

688
00:26:36.646 --> 00:26:38.125
SAM: I'm really hungry all the time.

689
00:26:38.125 --> 00:26:39.258
LAURA: I mean, me too.

690
00:26:39.258 --> 00:26:41.178
And I also kind of get pissed sometimes,

691
00:26:41.178 --> 00:26:43.529
I hide it, but what if I'm influenced

692
00:26:43.529 --> 00:26:45.297
by the Chained Oblivion?

693
00:26:45.297 --> 00:26:47.136
TALIESIN: I'm pretty good.

694
00:26:47.136 --> 00:26:51.636
TRAVIS: In Xhorhas, remember that, the furry creature, the--

695
00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:53.986
MARISHA: What?

696
00:26:53.986 --> 00:26:55.003
TRAVIS: The bugbear, right?

697
00:26:55.003 --> 00:26:57.385
He had bouts of violence and--

698
00:26:57.385 --> 00:27:02.385
MARISHA: Anger. And Asarius, and we've talked to the,

699
00:27:02.625 --> 00:27:05.143
oh right, was that Asarius, is that what you just said?

700
00:27:05.143 --> 00:27:09.387
I mean, even going all the way back to Trostenwald,

701
00:27:09.387 --> 00:27:11.671
with the ner-- ner-gill--

702
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:13.397
LAURA: Oh, and the gnolls!

703
00:27:14.336 --> 00:27:15.766
TALIESIN: That, you got me on that one.

704
00:27:15.766 --> 00:27:16.599
LAURA: No wait.

705
00:27:16.599 --> 00:27:19.110
I might have been making that part up, I don't know.

706
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.368
SAM: The gnolls, were they hungry?

707
00:27:20.368 --> 00:27:21.534
TALIESIN: Most are.

708
00:27:21.534 --> 00:27:22.867
LAURA: They came in and--

709
00:27:22.867 --> 00:27:24.037
SAM: They were aggressive, though, they--

00:33:58.353 --> 00:33:59.893
SAM: We didn't, oh sorry, go on.

885
00:33:59.893 --> 00:34:00.726
MARISHA: No, go ahead.
SAM: No, go on, go on.

886
00:34:00.726 --> 00:34:02.333
MARISHA: I was just justifying.

887
00:34:02.333 --> 00:34:04.602
SAM: Oh, I was just going to say,

888
00:34:04.602 --> 00:34:08.471
we didn't attack him, he doesn't know that we're enemies.

889
00:34:08.471 --> 00:34:09.503
TALIESIN: We're not enemies.

890
00:34:09.503 --> 00:34:11.302
SAM: No, I don't think, right?

891
00:34:11.302 --> 00:34:15.213
LAURA: But Trent would know that Caleb is.

892
00:34:15.213 --> 00:34:16.046
Wouldn't he?

893
00:34:16.046 --> 00:34:17.703
SAM: Trent saw Caleb and didn't say anything.

894
00:34:17.703 --> 00:34:19.631
TRAVIS: No. He did not.
LIAM: He didn't.

895
00:34:19.631 --> 00:34:22.842
MATT: "If there is a concern with this Trent,

896
00:34:22.842 --> 00:34:24.451
"who I believe I know who you're speaking of,

897
00:34:24.451 --> 00:34:28.551
"then just avoid him, do not bring him up."

898
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:30.782
SAM: So we can go see Oremid?

899
00:34:30.782 --> 00:34:32.903
LAURA: He's super duper powerful, didn't you know that?

900
00:34:32.903 --> 00:34:34.443
MATT: "So is the rest of the Assembly.

901
00:34:34.443 --> 00:34:35.718
"So am I."

902
00:34:35.718 --> 00:34:37.893
LAURA: Well, yeah, but you're nice.

903
00:34:37.893 --> 00:34:40.951
MATT: "Well. Do not think the entire Assembly is useless.

904
00:34:40.951 --> 00:34:44.263
"They have a few dubious figures,

"but not all of them are bad eggs."

TRAVIS: Oh man, we're going to the Halls of Erudition?

907
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.417
SAM: That's in Zadash.

908
00:34:54.417 --> 00:34:58.041
MATT: Allura goes, "I feel like I should at least

909

SAM: The Council, huh?

915
00:35:11.344 --> 00:35:12.277
LAURA: Who's on the Council?!

916
00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:14.856
MARISHA: Can you give us a list?

917
00:35:14.856 --> 00:35:17.235
SAM: Who would that be?

918
00:35:17.235 --> 00:35:18.237
MATT: She teleports away.

919
00:35:18.237 --> 00:35:23.020
(groans, laughter)

920
00:35:26.077 --> 00:35:27.343
TALIESIN: Mercer!

00:35:30.854 --> 00:35:32.235
MATT: Left with Yussa and Wensforth

00:35:32.235 --> 00:35:33.563
who's in the corner in his chair,

924
00:35:33.563 --> 00:35:35.995
just watching the whole thing, bright eyed.

925
00:35:35.995 --> 00:35:36.828
He just goes--

926
00:35:38.045 --> 00:35:38.878
TALIESIN: Wow.

927
00:35:40.016 --> 00:35:44.899
MATT: "If you are going to Oremid to ask for his expertise,

928

the whole time you guys have been having this conversation,

932
00:35:53.795 --> 00:35:57.414
he's Mage Handing with a quill and ink over on the counter,

933
00:35:57.414 --> 00:35:58.587
it's writing its own letter

934
00:35:58.587 --> 00:36:00.648
about 20 feet away from him.

935
00:36:00.648 --> 00:36:02.438
It then drifts over to--

936
00:36:02.438 --> 00:36:04.688
(laughter)

937
00:36:06.507 --> 00:36:07.736
MARISHA: You fucking motherfucker.

938
00:36:07.736 --> 00:36:09.745
(laughter)

939
00:36:09.745 --> 00:36:11.707
SAM: It's Brian Foster's payback.

940
00:36:11.707 --> 00:36:14.736
(laughter)

941
00:36:14.736 --> 00:36:16.288
MARISHA: Don't put this on him!

942
00:36:16.288 --> 00:36:18.805
TRAVIS: That's a cute turtle, if it makes any difference.

943
00:36:18.805 --> 00:36:21.419
MARISHA: I know Brian's brand of payback,
and that ain't it.

944
00:36:21.419 --> 00:36:23.225
(laughter)

945
00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:24.358
MATT: As the parchment drifts through the air

946
00:36:24.358 --> 00:36:26.589
and then folds, a ribbon ties itself on it,

947
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:28.660
and it lands over on Jester's lap.

948
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.687
LAURA: Me!

949
00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:31.517
(laughter)

950
00:36:31.517 --> 00:36:33.517
TALIESIN: How closely should we trust this person,

951
00:36:33.517 --> 00:36:36.474
how much information should we give them?

952
00:36:36.474 --> 00:36:38.397
MATT: "As much as you deem necessary.

953
00:36:38.397 --> 00:36:41.476
"As much as that would be useful
for what you're going after.

954
00:36:41.476 --> 00:36:44.476
"Be guarded, but Oremid is one of the...

955
00:36:45.887 --> 00:36:48.165
"less problematic members of the Assembly."

956
00:36:48.165 --> 00:36:50.269
TALIESIN: We're naturally mistrusting people,

957
00:36:50.269 --> 00:36:51.938
so it's always important to ask.

958
00:36:51.938 --> 00:36:53.571
MATT: "Good, you've survived this long."
TRAVIS: We've also encountered

959
00:36:53.571 --> 00:36:56.287
a fair number of people that are not who they seem,

960
00:36:56.287 --> 00:36:58.626
or are pretending to be something else.

961
00:36:58.626 --> 00:37:00.997
Is there a question that we could ask

962
00:37:00.997 --> 00:37:04.426
or perhaps some way of verifying that

963
00:37:04.426 --> 00:37:06.426
he is who you say he is?

964
00:37:07.567 --> 00:37:09.067
MATT: "I would say-- hm.

965
00:37:11.157 --> 00:37:15.140
"I couldn't help but notice around
your neck, this...

966
00:37:16.523 --> 00:37:18.414
tiny furred creature."

967
00:37:18.414 --> 00:37:21.330
LAURA: Oh, I thought you were talking about
my ruby necklace, which is very beautiful,

968
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:23.105
but yes, this is Sprinkle.

969
00:37:23.105 --> 00:37:26.578
MATT: "Oremid will react favorably to such a creature."

970
00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:28.888
SAM: Oh, he likes all little furry creatures?

971
00:37:28.888 --> 00:37:31.415
TALIESIN: I think Sprinkle's been dead
since the Happy Fun Ball, right?

972
00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:32.620
(laughter)

973
00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.544
TALIESIN: Covered in acid.
MARISHA: Just dead.

974
00:37:34.544 --> 00:37:36.729
(laughter)

975
00:37:36.729 --> 00:37:40.709
TRAVIS: Don't say it out loud! Are you crazy?

976
00:37:40.709 --> 00:37:42.230
If she hasn't felt--
MARISHA: Hasn't figured it out!

977
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.646
TRAVIS: Just leave him there!

978
00:37:43.646 --> 00:37:47.584
LIAM: He's just stiff, hanging
from a little string around--

979
00:37:47.584 --> 00:37:49.208
TALIESIN: A solid collar now.

980
00:37:49.208 --> 00:37:50.904
(laughter)

981
00:37:50.904 --> 00:37:54.286
LAURA: He hides inside my armor whenever we're in battle,

982
00:37:54.286 --> 00:37:56.574
and he's super duper protected.

983
00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:59.125
LIAM: (Jester accent) I am Vex and he's
in there with Trinket.

984
00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:01.714
(laughter)
LAURA: Shut up!

985
00:38:01.714 --> 00:38:03.182
SAM: He hasn't been fed in months!

986
00:38:03.182 --> 00:38:04.583
(laughter)
LAURA: I've been feeding him!

987
00:38:04.583 --> 00:38:07.424
MATT: It's assumed that she's been feeding him.

988
00:38:07.424 --> 00:38:08.530
TALIESIN: It's like that Tamagotchi.

989
00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.801
LAURA: Every time I eat, imagine that I'm
also giving Sprinkle food, okay?

990
00:38:11.801 --> 00:38:13.692
TRAVIS: Sprinkle gets attention and he's like,

991
00:38:13.692 --> 00:38:14.758
(small high voice) "Please!"

992
00:38:14.758 --> 00:38:16.108

MATT: Let me tell you, the best part
about playing D&amp;D with friends

995
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.183
is making your friends keep track

996
00:38:20.183 --> 00:38:22.809
of all your imaginary animals' responsibilities.

997
00:38:22.809 --> 00:38:25.059
(laughter)

998
00:38:26.923 --> 00:38:28.801
SAM: He likes furry things.

999
00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:29.652
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1000
00:38:29.652 --> 00:38:31.641
MATT: "The smaller, the cuter, the better."

1001
00:38:31.641 --> 00:38:34.198
SAM: (laughs) He's a furry lover!

1002
00:38:34.198 --> 00:38:35.036
Okay, cool!

1003
00:38:35.036 --> 00:38:40.036
LIAM: Yussa, this Oremid is one of the less problematic.

1004
00:38:40.107 --> 00:38:42.699
Which ones do you deem problematic

1005
00:38:42.699 --> 00:38:45.456
and what do you estimate their problems to be?

1006
00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:48.395

will you be going back in?

00:41:05.098 --> 00:41:07.265
"that I managed to recover."

1057
00:41:09.499 --> 00:41:13.327
SAM: Should we look--
TRAVIS: Not in the room, no, thank you!

1058
00:41:13.327 --> 00:41:15.131
MATT: "Speaking of which."

1059
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:17.699
Looks over to the unconscious body of Halas

1060
00:41:17.699 --> 00:41:19.289
(laughs) on the floor.

1061
00:41:19.289 --> 00:41:21.099
TRAVIS: Oh right, where's the jewel?

1062
00:41:21.099 --> 00:41:22.950
TALIESIN: I already handed it over.

1063
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.318
Like, yeah.

1064
00:41:24.318 --> 00:41:25.807
LAURA: I think Nott has it.

1065
00:41:25.807 --> 00:41:27.738
(laughter)

1066
00:41:27.738 --> 00:41:29.829
TALIESIN: Oh, you got it right there,
look at that. That's right.

1067
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:31.276
TRAVIS: Also, just out of curiosity,

1068
00:41:31.276 --> 00:41:34.010
if you touch it, there's still a voice in there, right?

1069
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.180
SAM: Let's find out!

1070
00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.220
Hello?

1071
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.986
MATT: (as Halas) "Hello.

1072
00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.960
"You're the one, you called yourself Nott.

1073
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.629
"Is that right?"

1074
00:41:45.629 --> 00:41:46.462
SAM: Yes.

1075
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:48.401
MATT: "Well."

1076
00:41:48.401 --> 00:41:49.234
TRAVIS: Oh good.

1077
00:41:49.234 --> 00:41:50.842
MATT: "Where are we?

1078
00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:53.850
"Have we been successful in your escape?"

1079
00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.321
SAM: How would you do it?

1080
00:41:56.321 --> 00:41:57.522
MATT: "Do what?"

1081
00:41:57.522 --> 00:41:59.962
SAM: How would you change a body

1082
00:41:59.962 --> 00:42:01.300
if you could?

1083
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.750
MATT: "Oh, that depends on what you
wish to change it into. You see that--"

1084
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:05.583
TRAVIS: Nott.

1085
00:42:05.583 --> 00:42:08.482
MATT: "As I know you've looked into my research,

1086
00:42:08.482 --> 00:42:10.741
"there are ways to, I believe, take a mortal body

1087
00:42:10.741 --> 00:42:13.289
"and make it perpetual."

1088
00:42:13.289 --> 00:42:14.893
TRAVIS: Maybe put the jewel down.

1089
00:42:14.893 --> 00:42:16.773
SAM: Is it a spell or a ritual?

1090
00:42:16.773 --> 00:42:17.606
TRAVIS: Caleb?

1091
00:42:17.606 --> 00:42:18.602
MATT: "Both.

1092
00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:21.393
"They're not mutually exclusive, small one."
TALIESIN: This has gone on long enough.

1093
00:42:21.393 --> 00:42:24.313
SAM: Do you know-- do you know what it is?

1094
00:42:24.313 --> 00:42:27.079
Do you know it, or would you have to find it?

1095
00:42:27.079 --> 00:42:29.582
MATT: "I would have to take a look at my notes.

1096
00:42:29.582 --> 00:42:32.561
"I was not entirely finished.

1097
00:42:32.561 --> 00:42:34.980
"But if you release me from this gem,

1098
00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.160
"I would help you to pursue whatever this may be."
TRAVIS: We don't want to take the jewel from you,

1099
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:38.993
maybe you just put it down.

1100
00:42:38.993 --> 00:42:41.493
SAM: I need something more concrete than that,

1101
00:42:41.493 --> 00:42:43.872
the name of a spell, something.

1102
00:42:43.872 --> 00:42:45.781
LIAM: We discussed this.
MATT: "It is unnamed at the moment,

1103
00:42:45.781 --> 00:42:47.699
"but it was part of my design,

1104
00:42:47.699 --> 00:42:50.621
"for myself and, should you be interested,

1105
00:42:50.621 --> 00:42:52.159
"little goblin girl--"

1106
00:42:52.159 --> 00:42:54.318
LIAM: Set it down!
MATT: "--yours as well."

1107
00:42:54.318 --> 00:42:57.272
SAM: How do I get you out if I wanted to?

1108
00:42:57.272 --> 00:43:00.032
MATT: "Dispel this jewel."

1109
00:43:00.032 --> 00:43:02.170
SAM: Dispel the jewel.

1110
00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:03.557
MARISHA: As I hear--

1111
00:43:03.557 --> 00:43:04.501
MATT: "Near."

1112
00:43:04.501 --> 00:43:05.912
TALIESIN: I cast Silence.

1113
00:43:05.912 --> 00:43:07.872
SAM: Near your--

1114
00:43:07.872 --> 00:43:11.581
MARISHA: I snatch-- I'm going to attempt
to snatch the jewel.

1115
00:43:11.581 --> 00:43:13.701
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

1116
00:43:13.701 --> 00:43:16.665
And you make an insight-- or you make a perception check.

1117
00:43:16.665 --> 00:43:18.098
SAM: Oh, perception?

1118
00:43:18.098 --> 00:43:19.464
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Wow.

1119
00:43:19.464 --> 00:43:21.153
SAM: 11.

1120
00:43:21.153 --> 00:43:23.911
What did you say, sleight of hand?
MATT: Yeah.

1121
00:43:23.911 --> 00:43:24.745
MARISHA: 14.

1122
00:43:24.745 --> 00:43:25.578
MATT: 14.

1123
00:43:25.578 --> 00:43:28.374
As you're in conversation, your voice goes gone,
you look over at Caduceus and you look back,

1124
00:43:28.374 --> 00:43:29.616
the gem's out of your hand.

1125
00:43:29.616 --> 00:43:31.866
(laughter)

1126
00:43:33.375 --> 00:43:36.526
(no sound)

1127
00:43:36.526 --> 00:43:37.601
SAM: Are we all silenced?

1128
00:43:37.601 --> 00:43:38.699
TALIESIN: No, just you.

1129
00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:40.048
(laughter)

1130
00:43:40.048 --> 00:43:41.224
MARISHA: Hang on, wait, wait, wait,

1131
00:43:41.224 --> 00:43:42.864
just let her get it out of her system for a minute.

1132
00:43:42.864 --> 00:43:44.488
(laughter)

1133
00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:46.257
No, it was great. Good work.

1134
00:43:46.257 --> 00:43:49.411
TRAVIS: If you could read lips, I see a lot of Fs and Ss.

1135
00:43:49.411 --> 00:43:50.244
MARISHA: Yeah.

1136
00:43:50.244 --> 00:43:51.229
TRAVIS: A couple Gs.

1137
00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:52.219
TALIESIN: Ferns.

1138
00:43:52.219 --> 00:43:53.439
Soliloquies.

1139
00:43:53.439 --> 00:43:54.749
LAURA: I don't think she's that angry.

1140
00:43:54.749 --> 00:43:55.977
TALIESIN: Gentle.

1141
00:43:55.977 --> 00:43:57.011
TRAVIS: Yep.

1142
00:43:57.011 --> 00:43:59.189
Those hands are not easy to mistake.

1143
00:43:59.189 --> 00:44:00.952
MARISHA: I think she's gotten it out of her-- oh.

1144
00:44:00.952 --> 00:44:01.891
LAURA: Not yet.

1145
00:44:01.891 --> 00:44:03.882
MARISHA: I think she's got it out of her system.
TRAVIS: That means "cracker."

1146
00:44:03.882 --> 00:44:06.534
"More cracker." It's baby sign language.

1147
00:44:06.534 --> 00:44:08.150
LAURA: (laughing)

1148
00:44:11.259 --> 00:44:13.821
MARISHA: You can drop the spell, I think.

1149
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:15.072
SAM: Your face is stupid!

1150
00:44:15.072 --> 00:44:16.912
(laughter)

1151
00:44:16.912 --> 00:44:18.079
MARISHA: That's fair.

1152
00:44:19.051 --> 00:44:20.760
TALIESIN: A very dangerous and powerful mage

1153
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.910
now knows your name.

1154
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:26.512
TRAVIS: It's just good to know that he is still in there,

1155
00:44:26.512 --> 00:44:30.070
which is where we want to keep him, right, Nott?

1156
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:33.043
TALIESIN: Because if he gets out, he knows your name.

1157
00:44:33.043 --> 00:44:36.941
MATT: "If you want, I am more than happy to jettison both

1158
00:44:36.941 --> 00:44:41.651
"that body and that gem far into the scattered planes.

1159
00:44:41.651 --> 00:44:43.283
"I have the means."

1160
00:44:43.283 --> 00:44:46.544
MARISHA: Did he sound like he knew what he could do?

1161
00:44:46.544 --> 00:44:49.272
SAM: He sounded confident that he could do something.

1162
00:44:49.272 --> 00:44:50.733
LIAM: He was telling you what to do.

1163
00:44:50.733 --> 00:44:52.203
You spoke of dispelling that--

1164
00:44:52.203 --> 00:44:54.870
LAURA: Confident that he eats people.

1165
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.182
He definitely eats people.

1166
00:44:58.182 --> 00:44:59.015
SAM: He does?

1167
00:44:59.015 --> 00:44:59.848
LAURA: Yeah.

1168
00:44:59.848 --> 00:45:02.803
TRAVIS: He has a restaurant called the
Carving Board in the Happy Fun Ball.

1169
00:45:02.803 --> 00:45:04.087
TALIESIN: I love the Carving Board.

1170
00:45:04.087 --> 00:45:06.293
LIAM: He built a prison and left chests

1171
00:45:06.293 --> 00:45:08.773
that murdered you in the blink of an eye.

1172
00:45:08.773 --> 00:45:10.883
SAM: It's the first time I've had an opportunity

1173
00:45:10.883 --> 00:45:13.674
to be myself again.

1174
00:45:13.674 --> 00:45:16.174
And I can't just leave it alone!

1175
00:45:17.552 --> 00:45:19.272
It's the thing!

1176
00:45:19.272 --> 00:45:21.163
TALIESIN: It's not an opportunity.
SAM: This is the thing!

1177
00:45:21.163 --> 00:45:21.996
LAURA: Yussa!

1178
00:45:21.996 --> 00:45:23.724
LIAM: Do you think that the man who built that place

1179
00:45:23.724 --> 00:45:25.141
would be willing to help you--

1180
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:25.974
SAM: Maybe.

1181
00:45:25.974 --> 00:45:28.190
LIAM: He would be beneficial to you, he's an altruist?

1182
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.138
That is the impression you got from the person

1183
00:45:30.138 --> 00:45:32.971
who chained a Dreadnought

1184
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:36.400
and built a lever to open its mouth like a door.

1185
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.475
Who has a prison.

1186
00:45:37.475 --> 00:45:39.520
SAM: I don't judge his taste in decor.

1187
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.353
TALIESIN: Nott.

1188
00:45:40.353 --> 00:45:42.259
Nott, you have to understand the difference

1189
00:45:42.259 --> 00:45:45.958
between an opportunity and a temptation.

1190
00:45:45.958 --> 00:45:47.091
That was a temptation.

1191
00:45:47.091 --> 00:45:49.291
There's a big difference.

1192
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:51.600
MARISHA: Look, we have one option, right?

1193
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.949
SAM: Mm-hmm.

1194
00:45:52.949 --> 00:45:55.629
MARISHA: We know that this is here.

1195
00:45:55.629 --> 00:45:58.787
SAM: Not if he sends it away to a far off place.

1196
00:46:00.029 --> 00:46:01.358
LAURA and MARISHA: Yussa.

1197
00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:02.868
MATT: "Yes?"

1198
00:46:02.868 --> 00:46:04.479
LAURA: Do you know of a spell

1199
00:46:04.479 --> 00:46:08.529
that would turn somebody into something else?

1200
00:46:08.529 --> 00:46:11.978
MATT: "There are-- polymorph is a relatively simple--"

1201
00:46:11.978 --> 00:46:13.380
LAURA: Yeah, but permanently.

1202
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.809
Like, put them back in their right body.

1203
00:46:15.809 --> 00:46:19.145
TALIESIN: Someone is in the wrong body.

1204
00:46:19.145 --> 00:46:21.758
MATT: "It's a bit beyond my immediate scope,

1205
00:46:21.758 --> 00:46:26.758
"but there is a-- I've heard whispers of a truest polymorph,

1206
00:46:27.078 --> 00:46:30.795
"though even that is only until dispelled.

1207
00:46:30.795 --> 00:46:33.689
"It is not a permanent endeavor,

1208
00:46:33.689 --> 00:46:35.438
"but it can become most anything."

1209
00:46:35.438 --> 00:46:40.306
LIAM: This one has been dabbling in his time.

1210
00:46:40.306 --> 00:46:42.146
Within the sphere.

1211
00:46:42.146 --> 00:46:45.728
I have notes of his, they're incomplete, but,

1212
00:46:45.728 --> 00:46:48.907
he felt like he was on the right track.

1213
00:46:48.907 --> 00:46:49.882
MATT: You have these notes?

1214
00:46:49.882 --> 00:46:50.715
LIAM: Yes.

1215
00:46:52.737 --> 00:46:55.478
MATT: "And what is your speciality?"

1216
00:46:55.478 --> 00:46:57.203
LIAM: Transmutation.

1217
00:46:59.209 --> 00:47:00.634
MATT: "You're fairly bright."

1218
00:47:05.369 --> 00:47:06.929
LIAM: Is that a challenge?

1219
00:47:06.929 --> 00:47:07.979
MATT: "Always."

1220
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:18.279
LIAM: I'm not going to peel inches of your flesh off

1221
00:47:18.279 --> 00:47:19.918
and eat them.

1222
00:47:19.918 --> 00:47:22.609
(suspenseful music)

1223
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:24.642
SAM: It's so romantic.

1224
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:30.679
LIAM: I'm not as far along as him.

1225
00:47:32.379 --> 00:47:34.865
I'm not nearly as deranged,

1226
00:47:34.865 --> 00:47:37.198
and that's saying something.

1227
00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:40.322
SAM: All right.

1228
00:47:40.322 --> 00:47:43.137
LIAM: You can't change if you're dead.

1229
00:47:43.137 --> 00:47:44.304
Dead and gone.

1230
00:47:49.078 --> 00:47:50.411
SAM: All right, so,

1231
00:47:51.577 --> 00:47:54.561
you'll still work at it and try?

1232
00:47:58.095 --> 00:47:59.928
LIAM: Have a little faith.

1233
00:48:03.266 --> 00:48:04.266
SAM: All right.

1234
00:48:06.809 --> 00:48:07.642
I trust...

1235
00:48:09.027 --> 00:48:11.666
<i>this</i> crazy wizard, I guess.

1236
00:48:11.666 --> 00:48:13.583
More than that one, so.

1237
00:48:14.626 --> 00:48:17.043
MATT: "Then you're a smart goblin."

1238
00:48:18.497 --> 00:48:19.614
LAURA: Halfling.

1239
00:48:21.718 --> 00:48:24.128
LIAM: It's complicated.
MATT: "Halfling."

1240
00:48:24.128 --> 00:48:27.426
MARISHA: Will you promise us that if we want to come back,

1241
00:48:27.426 --> 00:48:31.697
do anymore research on Halas, that we have full access?

1242
00:48:31.697 --> 00:48:33.529
MATT: "Full access to...?"

1243
00:48:33.529 --> 00:48:36.689
MARISHA: This. I don't know, what do
you plan to do with this?

1244
00:48:36.689 --> 00:48:39.510
TRAVIS: We'll send it into the--
MATT: "I was going to get rid of it entirely."

1245
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:42.009
TRAVIS: Yeah, like way out.
MARISHA: (skeptically) Ahh.

1246
00:48:42.009 --> 00:48:45.449
LAURA: Well, the heart was technically sent off into nothing

1247
00:48:45.449 --> 00:48:47.379
and Halas found it.

1248
00:48:47.379 --> 00:48:48.541
MATT: "Well, here.

1249
00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:50.529
"Unless I am mistaken,

1250
00:48:50.529 --> 00:48:55.219
"that spirit can only return to that body, correct?"

1251
00:48:55.219 --> 00:48:57.886
TRAVIS: Yes, that's our understanding.
SAM: That's what he said.

1252
00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:01.281
MATT: You watch Yussa open his hand,

1253
00:49:01.281 --> 00:49:03.790
and you watch as the unconscious body of Halas

1254
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.459
begin to blacken and crackle,

1255
00:49:06.459 --> 00:49:11.459
as he begins to burn into cinder and ash on the floor.

1256
00:49:11.739 --> 00:49:13.601
In but a matter of 20 seconds or so,

1257
00:49:13.601 --> 00:49:15.721
the smell of burned flesh fills the chamber--

1258
00:49:15.721 --> 00:49:18.938
it's disgusting, before it slowly
filters out the open window.

1259
00:49:18.938 --> 00:49:20.409
TALIESIN: I can get behind that.

1260
00:49:20.409 --> 00:49:22.241
TRAVIS: (laughing)
MARISHA: Oh!

1261
00:49:22.241 --> 00:49:24.430
MATT: "Look at that, now there is no longer worry

1262
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.030
"of him returning to his form."

1263
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.910
SAM: Wow!

1264
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.584
LIAM: That was--

1265
00:49:28.584 --> 00:49:29.630
MATT: "Effective?"

1266
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:30.751
LIAM: Decisive.

1267
00:49:30.751 --> 00:49:32.291
TRAVIS: Maybe don't touch the stone

1268
00:49:32.291 --> 00:49:35.641
and see if Halas needs an update.

1269
00:49:35.641 --> 00:49:38.289
MATT: "Let's just let him continue to think otherwise."

1270
00:49:38.289 --> 00:49:40.909
LAURA: Let's see if he's crying.

1271
00:49:40.909 --> 00:49:43.377
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: Let's actually not touch the--

1272
00:49:43.377 --> 00:49:45.151
MARISHA: Can everyone be quiet for a second?

1273
00:49:45.151 --> 00:49:46.234
TALIESIN: No, let's--

1274
00:49:48.186 --> 00:49:49.353
MATT: "Hello, Beau."

1275
00:49:50.295 --> 00:49:52.073
MARISHA: Hey, Halas.

1276
00:49:52.073 --> 00:49:55.422
MATT: "So, might I speak to the goblin girl once more,

1277
00:49:55.422 --> 00:49:56.661
"if you do not mind?"

1278
00:49:56.661 --> 00:49:59.505
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Totally, yeah, you know what?

1279
00:49:59.505 --> 00:50:01.622
She actually just went out for--

1280
00:50:01.622 --> 00:50:02.804
TALIESIN: Silence.

1281
00:50:02.804 --> 00:50:05.113
LAURA: (laughing)

1282
00:50:05.113 --> 00:50:07.673
SAM: Yeah! Doesn't feel so good now, does it?

1283
00:50:07.673 --> 00:50:09.214
Huh, huh?

1284
00:50:09.214 --> 00:50:10.094
TALIESIN: Every word--

1285
00:50:10.094 --> 00:50:11.593
SAM: Your arms are weird.

1286
00:50:11.593 --> 00:50:13.894
Huh, you can't say anything back, can you?

1287
00:50:13.894 --> 00:50:15.774
TALIESIN: Every word will come back to haunt us.

1288
00:50:15.774 --> 00:50:17.844
MATT: "Beauregard, I cannot hear you."

1289
00:50:17.844 --> 00:50:20.132
TALIESIN: I don't actually know if that'll--
she can't hear anything I'm saying.

1290
00:50:20.132 --> 00:50:22.334
MATT: The voice continues through the gem

1291
00:50:22.334 --> 00:50:26.102
because it is telepathic to you.

1292
00:50:26.102 --> 00:50:27.102
TALIESIN: I would--

1293
00:50:28.433 --> 00:50:29.862
Perhaps we could just put that-- yeah.

1294
00:50:29.862 --> 00:50:31.979
TRAVIS: Give this to Yussa.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1295
00:50:31.979 --> 00:50:33.056
Let's do that.

1296
00:50:33.056 --> 00:50:34.765
MATT: The Mage Hand grasps it,

1297
00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:36.314
and as the Mage Hand lifts in the air,

1298
00:50:36.314 --> 00:50:38.544
he will not actually make physical contact with the stone.

1299
00:50:38.544 --> 00:50:41.163
TALIESIN: That's the smart way to do it, drop Silence.

1300
00:50:41.163 --> 00:50:43.313
MATT: Puts it onto a table, the same Mage Hand pulls--

1301
00:50:43.313 --> 00:50:44.832
MARISHA: I was just going to say you were going out to pee,

1302
00:50:44.832 --> 00:50:46.907
and you'll be back never.

1303
00:50:46.907 --> 00:50:48.542
SAM: That would've been clever.

1304
00:50:48.542 --> 00:50:50.375
MARISHA: Yeah. But, you know.

1305
00:50:50.375 --> 00:50:51.458
You cut off my joke, man.

1306
00:50:51.458 --> 00:50:53.190
SAM: I didn't cut off your joke! He did!

1307
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:54.942
MARISHA: You fucking cut off my joke.

1308
00:50:54.942 --> 00:50:56.480
TALIESIN: I think the less said to something

1309
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.468
that may be able to tell the difference

1310
00:50:58.468 --> 00:50:59.920
between the truth and a lie,

1311
00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:02.950
and probably a lot more information just by us touching,

1312
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:05.880
it's a lot, that's not the sort of
thing you should be touching.

1313
00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.691
LAURA: Would have been the last thing he heard,
he would have got a good joke.

1314
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:10.609
TALIESIN: And when he eventually gets out--

1315
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:13.075
MARISHA: And then he'd be like, oh shit.

1316
00:51:13.075 --> 00:51:15.894
SAM: Now he's wondering what the punch line was,

1317
00:51:15.894 --> 00:51:17.584
and he'll wonder forever.

1318
00:51:17.584 --> 00:51:19.734
TALIESIN: No, he'll eventually get out and find you.

1319
00:51:19.734 --> 00:51:21.854
LAURA: He's not going to get out! Don't worry, he's in--

1320
00:51:21.854 --> 00:51:24.614
MATT: You hear these two heavy impacts,
you watch as you're having this conversation,

1321
00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:28.331
Yussa has Mage Handed the gem over onto
the nearby table corners,

1322
00:51:28.331 --> 00:51:30.381
draws a line through the air with the other hand,

1323
00:51:30.381 --> 00:51:31.642
mutters an incantation,

1324
00:51:31.642 --> 00:51:35.002
and you watch as an almost spectral looking chest

1325
00:51:35.002 --> 00:51:37.581
apparates through the air as he draws the line.

1326
00:51:37.581 --> 00:51:39.602
(imitates impact) Lands on the ground.

1327
00:51:39.602 --> 00:51:41.249
It opens. (imitates noisy hinges)

1328
00:51:41.249 --> 00:51:43.089
Mage Hands the gem over onto the inside,

1329
00:51:43.089 --> 00:51:44.892
it closes, and then, (imitates magical pop)

1330
00:51:44.892 --> 00:51:46.162
and then vanishes.

1331
00:51:46.162 --> 00:51:47.437
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: (clapping)

1332
00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:49.037
TALIESIN: But still--
SAM: That was good.

1333
00:51:49.037 --> 00:51:51.555
TALIESIN: Remember that we found that in the middle

1334
00:51:51.555 --> 00:51:56.061
of a Magic Fun Ball, inside a Dreadnought,

1335
00:51:56.061 --> 00:51:59.041
inside a magic space, I mean, it's these things--

1336
00:51:59.041 --> 00:52:01.233
MARISHA: I was there.
TALIESIN: Things get found.

1337
00:52:01.233 --> 00:52:04.010
MATT: "It's a Xhorhasian wooden doll."

1338
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:06.551
TRAVIS: We should be off, we have much to learn.

1339
00:52:06.551 --> 00:52:09.221
LIAM: That chest though, that was, that's not a pocket

1340
00:52:09.221 --> 00:52:10.906
for you to access later,

1341
00:52:10.906 --> 00:52:12.853
that was a random toss--

1342
00:52:12.853 --> 00:52:15.004
MATT: "No, that's a pocket for me to access later,

1343
00:52:15.004 --> 00:52:16.701
"hopefully not until it's needed.

1344
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:18.711
"But until you decide you have no further

1345
00:52:18.711 --> 00:52:20.722
"use of this individual,

1346
00:52:20.722 --> 00:52:23.231
"I will put it somewhere nobody
else can find it but myself."

1347
00:52:23.231 --> 00:52:25.089
LIAM: Excellent.
MARISHA: And you don't have any use?

1348
00:52:25.089 --> 00:52:26.772
MATT: "<i>If</i> you trust me."

1349
00:52:26.772 --> 00:52:30.878
LIAM: I think that Yussa would
prefer to inhabit his own flesh.

1350
00:52:30.878 --> 00:52:32.144
MATT: "Yes, I would."

1351
00:52:32.144 --> 00:52:33.662
SAM: Halas?

1352
00:52:33.662 --> 00:52:35.325
LIAM: No, I'm talking about Yussa.

1353
00:52:35.325 --> 00:52:38.662
Not wanting to be possessed by an all-powerful being.

1354
00:52:38.662 --> 00:52:42.023
TRAVIS: We will trust you, if you tell us who the members

1355
00:52:42.023 --> 00:52:44.783
of the Tal'Dorei Council are.

1356
00:52:44.783 --> 00:52:48.958
(laughter)

1357
00:52:48.958 --> 00:52:51.034
MATT: "I regret to inform you that my only experience

1358
00:52:51.034 --> 00:52:52.463
"has been with Allura.

1359
00:52:52.463 --> 00:52:53.671
"And members of the Pansophical."

1360
00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:55.054
TRAVIS: That's unfortunate.

1361
00:52:55.054 --> 00:52:56.758
MATT: "The Council, I do not--

1362
00:52:56.758 --> 00:52:58.274
"I prefer to avoid politics."

1363
00:52:58.274 --> 00:52:59.499
LIAM: Just one name. Just one.

1364
00:52:59.499 --> 00:53:01.185
(laughter)

1365
00:53:01.185 --> 00:53:04.227
TRAVIS: No newsletter coming by raven?

1366
00:53:05.407 --> 00:53:08.034
LIAM: Your old friend Allura, she told you--

1367
00:53:08.034 --> 00:53:10.174
MATT: The older Seeker Assum.

1368
00:53:10.174 --> 00:53:11.524
(laughter)

1369
00:53:11.524 --> 00:53:13.032
Master of Spies.

1370
00:53:13.032 --> 00:53:15.204
Acid scarred and tattooed,

1371
00:53:15.204 --> 00:53:16.714
but now with a goatee!

1372
00:53:16.714 --> 00:53:18.889
ALL: Ooh!

1373
00:53:18.889 --> 00:53:19.859
TRAVIS: Upgrade!

1374
00:53:19.859 --> 00:53:21.844
(laughter)

1375
00:53:21.844 --> 00:53:23.234
TRAVIS: All right, so where are we off to?

1376
00:53:23.234 --> 00:53:24.600
SAM: To...

1377
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.190
Zadash!

1378
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.894
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1379
00:53:27.894 --> 00:53:29.820
We're going to go see the guy that's creepy.

1380
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.353
Not creepy.

1381
00:53:31.353 --> 00:53:32.992
He's normal.
TRAVIS: Loves furry animals.

1382
00:53:32.992 --> 00:53:35.262
MATT: "I cannot say he's not creepy, some degree, maybe,

1383
00:53:35.262 --> 00:53:37.429
"but just more trustworthy.

1384
00:53:38.352 --> 00:53:39.982

"The last thing you want is to be caught off guard."

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:53.984
SAM: Do you have any means for us to travel to Zadash

1391
00:53:53.984 --> 00:53:56.202
quicker than 14 days on horseback?

1392
00:53:56.202 --> 00:53:57.937
LAURA: No, we can bamf into the Cobalt Soul!

1393
00:53:57.937 --> 00:53:59.729
SAM: Oh, that's right!

1394
00:53:59.729 --> 00:54:02.359
LAURA: I'll send a message to--

1395
00:54:02.359 --> 00:54:05.409
MARISHA: Uh-huh, that's probably a good idea..
LAURA: Yeah.

1396
00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:06.769
MARISHA: To Zeenoth!

1397
00:54:06.769 --> 00:54:09.153
LAURA: Zeenoth, because-- okay.

1398
00:54:10.068 --> 00:54:11.639
MARISHA: Archivist Zeenoth.

1399
00:54:11.639 --> 00:54:13.164
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1400
00:54:14.148 --> 00:54:15.449
SAM: We're setting off?

1401
00:54:15.449 --> 00:54:17.668
MARISHA: Wiry, mousey guy.

1402
00:54:17.668 --> 00:54:19.000
A little annoying.

1403
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.879
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we met him.

1404
00:54:20.879 --> 00:54:22.608
I'm going to send a message.

1405
00:54:22.608 --> 00:54:24.274
What's his name?
MARISHA: Zeenoth.

1406
00:54:24.274 --> 00:54:25.673
LAURA: Zeenoth.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1407
00:54:25.673 --> 00:54:27.900
LAURA: Hey, Archivist Zeenoth!

1408
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.858
This is the Mighty Nein.

1409
00:54:29.858 --> 00:54:31.916
MARISHA: What!
LAURA: I don't think-- what, what!

1410
00:54:31.916 --> 00:54:33.326
I don't think you like us, but--

1411
00:54:33.326 --> 00:54:36.339
(laughter)

1412
00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:37.994
are we allowed to come there yet,

1413
00:54:37.994 --> 00:54:39.967
because we have im--

1414
00:54:39.967 --> 00:54:41.037
(laughter)

1415
00:54:41.037 --> 00:54:43.274
TRAVIS: He has only half a word. "We have im--"?

1416
00:54:43.274 --> 00:54:45.432
LAURA: --portant.
TRAVIS: There you go.

1417
00:54:45.432 --> 00:54:47.182
TALIESIN: We have important.

1418
00:54:47.182 --> 00:54:48.043
MATT: Im--

1419
00:54:48.043 --> 00:54:49.334
TRAVIS: You wasted a "what what."

1420
00:54:49.334 --> 00:54:51.326
(laughter)
LAURA: That was Beau's fault!

1421
00:54:51.326 --> 00:54:53.810
MARISHA: Sorry, I was trying to hype man your message.

1422
00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:56.398
LAURA: I hyped my own--?!

1423
00:54:56.398 --> 00:54:58.090
MATT: Zeenoth responds.

1424
00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.540
"Oh, that should be fine.

1425
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.420
"Everything has been smoothed over,

1426
00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:08.226
"so yes, please do come whenever."

1427
00:55:08.226 --> 00:55:09.297
LAURA: Whoa.

1428
00:55:09.297 --> 00:55:10.413
MARISHA: What did he say?

1429
00:55:10.413 --> 00:55:13.060
LAURA: He sounded super duper brown nosey,

1430
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.170
and he was like, hey.

1431
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:16.003
MARISHA: What?

1432
00:55:16.003 --> 00:55:18.460
LAURA: Everything's been smoothed over,
you're welcome anytime.

1433
00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:20.580
MARISHA: Ooh.
LAURA: Ooh, did he get in trouble?

1434
00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.155
MARISHA: Finally figured it out! That's right, unh!

1435
00:55:24.148 --> 00:55:25.479
We're awesome.

1436
00:55:25.479 --> 00:55:26.700
(laughter)

1437
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.420
LAURA: Oh my God.

1438
00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.588
He loves you now.

1439
00:55:29.588 --> 00:55:31.168
(laughter)

1440
00:55:31.168 --> 00:55:33.468
MARISHA: Or Dairon told him that I'm in charge now.

1441
00:55:33.468 --> 00:55:36.260
LAURA: Probably, I mean, Dairon
probably yelled at him really good.

1442
00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.890
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and was like,

1443
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:41.498
"You call the other branches and you
tell them that Beau's awesome!"

1444
00:55:41.498 --> 00:55:42.548
LAURA: Yeah!

1445
00:55:42.548 --> 00:55:45.218
You want me to send a message to all the other--?

1446
00:55:45.218 --> 00:55:48.788
MARISHA: No, no, that's fine, that's fine.

1447
00:55:48.788 --> 00:55:50.455
SAM: Should we set off?

1448
00:55:51.355 --> 00:55:52.522
MARISHA: Yeah, should we go now?

1449
00:55:52.522 --> 00:55:54.521
LAURA: Oh, oh, yeah.

1450
00:55:54.521 --> 00:55:55.553
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're rested, right?

1451
00:55:55.553 --> 00:55:57.527
TALIESIN: We're eventually going to want to sleep. Did we?

1452
00:55:57.527 --> 00:55:58.467
SAM: Did we rest?

1453
00:55:58.467 --> 00:55:59.300
LAURA: Nope.

1454
00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.133
TALIESIN: No.

1455
00:56:00.133 --> 00:56:01.216
SAM: Did we fight?

1456
00:56:01.216 --> 00:56:04.288
TALIESIN: I mean, we just got out of--
I mean, a lot happened.

1457
00:56:04.288 --> 00:56:06.488
SAM: Yeah, but I'm at-- I'm full.

1458
00:56:06.488 --> 00:56:08.821
LAURA: I got some spells gone.
TALIESIN: I got some spells gone.

1459
00:56:08.821 --> 00:56:11.848
LAURA: Plus if we go to Orly, we gots--

1460
00:56:11.848 --> 00:56:13.494
oh wait, we don't have dusted gems.

1461
00:56:13.494 --> 00:56:15.994
Hey, Yussa, do you have any gem dust?

1462
00:56:15.994 --> 00:56:18.092
TALIESIN: And a diamond.

1463
00:56:18.092 --> 00:56:19.800
LAURA: And a diamond, do you have a diamond?

1464
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.174
TRAVIS: Revivify diamond.

1465
00:56:21.174 --> 00:56:23.122
MATT: "Ah, let me look.

1466
00:56:23.122 --> 00:56:24.160
"Wensforth?"

1467
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.357
(as Wensforth) "Yes master, what can I do for you?"

1468
00:56:28.357 --> 00:56:31.297
(as Yussa) "Could we perhaps look around for a diamond,

1469
00:56:31.297 --> 00:56:32.130
"what--"

1470
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:33.658
LAURA: 300-ish.

1471
00:56:33.658 --> 00:56:35.237
MATT: "What they requested."

1472
00:56:35.237 --> 00:56:36.856
LAURA: And also just some gem dust.

1473
00:56:36.856 --> 00:56:39.546
MATT: "Which-- any specific type of gem?"

1474
00:56:39.546 --> 00:56:41.797
LAURA: Can I remember what Orly said we needed?

1475
00:56:41.797 --> 00:56:44.280
SAM: Different kinds, right?
TALIESIN: Yeah, all sorts of different kinds.

1476
00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.704
MATT: I could go and look it up real fast,

1477
00:56:46.704 --> 00:56:48.065
because I forgot.

1478
00:56:48.065 --> 00:56:50.836
TALIESIN: Write a swank rhyme about it.

1479
00:56:50.836 --> 00:56:52.194
MATT: (laughing)

1480
00:56:52.194 --> 00:56:54.011
MARISHA: There was a printout or something?

1481
00:56:54.011 --> 00:56:56.415
TALIESIN: Somewhere there was a printout,
that was a while ago.

1482
00:56:56.415 --> 00:56:58.412
SAM: Not of the tattoos.

1483
00:56:58.412 --> 00:57:00.228
MATT: I did, I thought I told you!

1484
00:57:00.228 --> 00:57:01.403
That's all right.

1485
00:57:01.403 --> 00:57:02.760
SAM: You told.

1486
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.473
LAURA: You told us.

1487
00:57:04.473 --> 00:57:05.902
MATT: That's okay, we'll--

1488
00:57:05.902 --> 00:57:07.241
LAURA: We're the worst.

1489
00:57:07.241 --> 00:57:10.241
(papers rustling)

1490
00:57:10.241 --> 00:57:12.800
TRAVIS: Think of all the Tusktooth
tattoos out there right now,

1491
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.770
just disappointed in you, Laura.

1492
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:16.507
LAURA: Wha-- why? What?

1493
00:57:16.507 --> 00:57:18.137
SAM: For not taking good notes.

1494
00:57:18.137 --> 00:57:20.590
LAURA: Look at my shit ass notes, of course that--

1495
00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:22.920
TRAVIS: Was that a panda I just saw on--?

1496
00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.345
MATT: So for Orly's talents,

1497
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:33.181
it is ruby dust for strength,

1498
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:35.227
emerald dust for dexterity,

1499
00:57:35.227 --> 00:57:36.850
diamond dust for constitution,

1500
00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:39.740
sapphire dust for intelligence, jade for wisdom,

1501
00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:43.330
aquamarine for charisma, fire opal for resist fire,

1502
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:48.050
starfire sapphire, or black star sapphire for resist cold.

1503
00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:51.428
And the amounts generally range between the 2,200 gold

1504
00:57:51.428 --> 00:57:54.649
to 2,500 gold for all the statistical benefits,

1505
00:57:54.649 --> 00:57:57.149
and 5,000 for the resistances.

1506
00:57:58.199 --> 00:58:03.050
TALIESIN: It doesn't-- it won't push you
beyond natural levels

1507
00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:05.410
either, will it? The tattoos?

1508
00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:06.976
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I mean--

1509
00:58:06.976 --> 00:58:09.478
MARISHA: Ooh!
TALIESIN: Really? Okay.

1510
00:58:09.478 --> 00:58:10.436
MATT: It's only plus one.

1511
00:58:10.436 --> 00:58:12.967
So even if you've hit the maximum of 20--

1512
00:58:12.967 --> 00:58:14.175
TRAVIS: You get a full sleeve?

1513
00:58:14.175 --> 00:58:16.463
MATT: --21 doesn't increase the amount of fire benefits.

1514
00:58:16.463 --> 00:58:18.885
LAURA: True. Okay.

1515
00:58:18.885 --> 00:58:21.191
LIAM: What if you got two tattoos?

1516
00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:22.631
TRAVIS: A quarter sleeve.

1517
00:58:22.631 --> 00:58:26.490
MATT: You can only get one tattoo per individual,
depending on what you have.

1518
00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:27.323
LAURA: Okay.

1519
00:58:28.288 --> 00:58:30.938
I don't know what all the other ones were,
that is as fast as I could write.

1520
00:58:30.938 --> 00:58:32.970
and it was pretty much nothing.

1521
00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:35.675
MATT: Well, if you tell me what statistic
you're looking possibly interested in,

1522
00:58:35.675 --> 00:58:36.883
I could find--

1523
00:58:36.883 --> 00:58:38.671
LAURA: I wrote down diamond for constitution,

1524
00:58:38.671 --> 00:58:41.690
that would be good for me.

1525
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:44.034
MARISHA: I'd be up in that jade.

1526
00:58:44.034 --> 00:58:45.079
For wisdom.

1527
00:58:45.079 --> 00:58:47.412
MATT: Jade for wisdom, plus one.

1528
00:58:48.297 --> 00:58:51.579
MARISHA: (laughs) Wait, what you wrote
down was wrong? (laughs)

1529
00:58:51.579 --> 00:58:52.997
LAURA: I suck!

1530
00:58:52.997 --> 00:58:54.831
My notes are just doodles!

1531
00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:56.756
(laughter)

1532
00:58:59.847 --> 00:59:01.968
SAM: Tonight we learned that Laura is illiterate.

1533
00:59:01.968 --> 00:59:03.227
(laughter)

1534
00:59:03.227 --> 00:59:05.159
LAURA: I need diamond dust.

1535
00:59:05.159 --> 00:59:06.398
Anybody else?

1536
00:59:06.398 --> 00:59:08.308
Anybody else need a stat that they would want--

1537
00:59:08.308 --> 00:59:11.428
SAM: Of course, but it sounds extremely expensive!

1538
00:59:11.428 --> 00:59:13.850
LAURA: Well, I don't know how much money
we just got from Halas.

1539
00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:16.532
TRAVIS: Yeah, J.G. Wentworth probably
has some diamond dust on standby.

1540
00:59:16.532 --> 00:59:18.707
LAURA: Well, it was Halas' stuff.

1541
00:59:19.884 --> 00:59:23.410
SAM: Yeah, I can use charisma, strength, anything.

1542
00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:24.946
LAURA: Yeah, woof, woof.

1543
00:59:24.946 --> 00:59:26.672
SAM: (laughs) Easy!

1544
00:59:26.672 --> 00:59:29.250
(laughter)

1545
00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:30.439
Don't stat shame me.

1546
00:59:30.439 --> 00:59:34.239
LAURA: (laughs) Oh shit! (laughs)

1547
00:59:34.239 --> 00:59:35.297
Okay.

1548
00:59:35.297 --> 00:59:38.999
MATT: All right, so what is it you guys are wanting to do?

1549
00:59:38.999 --> 00:59:41.570
TRAVIS: A 350 gold diamond, and some diamond dust.

1550
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.330
LAURA: A 300 gold diamond, yeah.

1551
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:45.479
MATT: We'll say, given the help with Yussa,

1552
00:59:45.479 --> 00:59:47.748
Wensforth goes ahead and brings you a diamond

1553
00:59:47.748 --> 00:59:49.581
worth 350 gold pieces.

1554
00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:53.476
(as Wensforth) "It's-- it's the largest one I could find.

1555
00:59:53.476 --> 00:59:55.618
"Is this all right, master?"

1556
00:59:55.618 --> 00:59:57.483
(as Yussa) "Yes, give it to them."

1557
00:59:57.483 --> 00:59:59.405
TALIESIN: I'll take it.
LAURA: Because you gave me yours.

1558
00:59:59.405 --> 01:00:01.611
TALIESIN: Oh, well, all right.

1559
01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:04.952
MATT: "And as far-- which gem did you request?"

1560
01:00:04.952 --> 01:00:06.785
LAURA: Diamond dust for me.

1561
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:11.571
MATT: "That is the diamond-- I would have to take a gem

1562
01:00:11.571 --> 01:00:13.688
"to turn it into dust, so I can convert that,

1563
01:00:13.688 --> 01:00:15.371
"but it would still only be about--"

1564
01:00:15.371 --> 01:00:16.390
TRAVIS: 350.

1565
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:17.941
LAURA: Anybody else?

1566
01:00:17.941 --> 01:00:21.171
Oh god, we need a lot of gem dust.

1567
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:24.000
TRAVIS: I mean, you could ask him if he has
an overabundance of rubies?

1568
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.341
MATT: Did anybody check-- pick up the satchel?

1569
01:00:26.341 --> 01:00:29.149
TRAVIS: Oh no, check in the fucking bag!
LAURA: Look in the bag, look in the bag!

1570
01:00:29.149 --> 01:00:30.861
TRAVIS: I open the bag.

1571
01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:32.913
SAM: It's all ruby dust. (laughs)
MATT: Yeah.

1572
01:00:32.913 --> 01:00:36.065
Checking it, it looks, it's-- first off, no gold.

1573
01:00:37.165 --> 01:00:39.020
At first, you're like, oh, the bag is silver.

1574
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.511
But then the light hits it,

1575
01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:43.041
and it's much more polished and much brighter in its color.

1576
01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:44.331
LAURA: Holy shit!

1577
01:00:44.331 --> 01:00:46.384
MATT: It is a satchel of platinum.

1578
01:00:46.384 --> 01:00:48.948
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! (laughs)

1579
01:00:48.948 --> 01:00:50.765
MATT: Do you want to--
LAURA: A whole satchel!

1580
01:00:50.765 --> 01:00:54.541
MATT: If you want to take the time to count it later on,

1581
01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:55.629
you can.

1582
01:00:55.629 --> 01:00:58.759
Or unless you want to count in the middle of his chamber
in front of everything, it's up to you, but--

1583
01:00:58.759 --> 01:00:59.799
LIAM: One.

1584
01:00:59.799 --> 01:01:01.256
LAURA: (laughs) No!

1585
01:01:01.256 --> 01:01:02.436
MATT: (laughs)

1586
01:01:02.436 --> 01:01:04.144
TRAVIS: We'll wait.

1587
01:01:04.144 --> 01:01:05.689
SAM: Pla-inum.

1588
01:01:05.689 --> 01:01:07.009
LAURA: Man, I really want to know.

1589
01:01:07.009 --> 01:01:08.301
MATT: For the of ease everything,

1590
01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:10.928
it comes to about 2,100 platinum.

1591
01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:12.856
SAM: Wait, 2,100 platinum?

1592
01:01:12.856 --> 01:01:13.689
MATT: Correct.

1593
01:01:13.689 --> 01:01:16.625
Which comes to about 21,000 gold pieces.

1594
01:01:16.625 --> 01:01:18.128
SAM: Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge!

1595
01:01:18.128 --> 01:01:19.461
LAURA: Wait, so wait.

1596
01:01:20.446 --> 01:01:21.827
Oh my God.

1597
01:01:21.827 --> 01:01:24.616
TRAVIS: I think it's the most money we've ever had.

1598
01:01:24.616 --> 01:01:25.787
MATT: This campaign, yeah.

1599
01:01:25.787 --> 01:01:27.396
MARISHA: We've been pretty D&amp;D poor.

1600
01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:29.737
MATT: You guys have been D&amp;D poor for a long time, and--

1601
01:01:29.737 --> 01:01:31.872
TRAVIS: We've been sitting in those three digits.
MARISHA: Yeah, we have.

1602
01:01:31.872 --> 01:01:34.405
MATT: And you pulled him out of a very, very
rich series of halls.

1603
01:01:34.405 --> 01:01:36.786
LAURA: So everybody gets 350 platinum.
MATT: And that's your split.

1604
01:01:36.786 --> 01:01:39.384
LIAM: Say that again?
LAURA: Everybody gets 350 platinum.

1605
01:01:39.384 --> 01:01:40.933
TALIESIN: Okay, that's happening.

1606
01:01:40.933 --> 01:01:41.852
TRAVIS: Shit!

1607
01:01:41.852 --> 01:01:43.773
SAM: (shocked laughter)  Wow!

1608
01:01:43.773 --> 01:01:45.362
TRAVIS: I'm Sam Riegel rich.

1609
01:01:45.362 --> 01:01:46.602
LIAM: 350.

1610
01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:49.002
(laughter)

1611
01:01:49.002 --> 01:01:50.420
SAM: Oh man.

1612
01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.402
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

1613
01:01:51.402 --> 01:01:53.021
LAURA: Woo!

1614
01:01:53.021 --> 01:01:54.135
TRAVIS: Cool.

1615
01:01:54.135 --> 01:01:55.526
TALIESIN: That's a number.

1616
01:01:55.526 --> 01:01:58.191
MATT: You got some spending cash.

1617
01:01:58.191 --> 01:01:59.832
SAM: Day-um!

1618
01:01:59.832 --> 01:02:01.241
LAURA: Day-um!

1619
01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:03.015
TRAVIS: Let's go to--
TALIESIN: I'm going to go buy--

1620
01:02:03.015 --> 01:02:05.374
TRAVIS: Pumat Sol's. I just said Gilmore's.

1621
01:02:05.374 --> 01:02:06.781
LAURA: Let's go buy everything!

1622
01:02:06.781 --> 01:02:09.635
MATT: If you're heading to Zadash, yeah, he'll be there.
LIAM: We can afford to now.

1623
01:02:09.635 --> 01:02:11.836
SAM: Are we going to go do these tattoos--
MATT: (as Gilmore) "Sorry, we haven't met quite yet."

1624
01:02:11.836 --> 01:02:13.682
TRAVIS: Those prices have gone up!

1625
01:02:13.682 --> 01:02:14.750
(laughter)

1626
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:15.899
Premium.

1627
01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:19.100
Go with the premium, Gilmore brand.

1628
01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.700
LAURA: I mean, it's up to you guys.

1629
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.757
MATT: (as Gilmore) "It's up to one of our
many dozen or so franchises."

1630
01:02:23.757 --> 01:02:26.083
TRAVIS: Yes!

1631
01:02:26.083 --> 01:02:28.487
LAURA: It's just constitution, I can wait.

1632
01:02:28.487 --> 01:02:29.320
TALIESIN: I mean--

1633
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.215
SAM: We're here.

1634
01:02:30.215 --> 01:02:31.304
TALIESIN: We're here.

1635
01:02:31.304 --> 01:02:33.685
MARISHA: We should probably go check in on our boat, right?

1636
01:02:33.685 --> 01:02:37.375
Do we owe taxes or marina rental or--
TALIESIN: Let's take a second to

1637
01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:38.707
collect ourselves.

1638
01:02:38.707 --> 01:02:40.499
SAM: Where do we go? We have to go to a jewel shop

1639
01:02:40.499 --> 01:02:41.933
for us to buy jewels?

1640
01:02:41.933 --> 01:02:42.973
LAURA: It's a thing.

1641
01:02:42.973 --> 01:02:44.233
Maybe we should just go to Zadash.

1642
01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:46.378
LIAM: What about your home?

1643
01:02:46.378 --> 01:02:47.841
MARISHA: Say hi to mom.

1644
01:02:47.841 --> 01:02:50.315
LAURA: We just said-- oh, I guess it's been a while.

1645
01:02:50.315 --> 01:02:51.605
MATT: You do know that Nicodranas,

1646
01:02:51.605 --> 01:02:52.772
because it is a port town,

1647
01:02:52.772 --> 01:02:55.224
there's a lot of trade, you could probably find

1648
01:02:55.224 --> 01:02:57.392
a number of gems if you're looking for it.

1649
01:02:57.392 --> 01:03:00.904
But you don't have to if you don't want to, either.

1650
01:03:00.904 --> 01:03:03.048
SAM: Do you want to try?

1651
01:03:03.048 --> 01:03:05.405
LAURA: I mean, I could get a tattoo, you guys!

1652
01:03:05.405 --> 01:03:07.296
SAM: I wouldn't mind one either.

1653
01:03:07.296 --> 01:03:10.329
TRAVIS: Sure.
MARISHA: Had my mind on one for a while.

1654
01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:11.656
LAURA: Let's go see Orly.

1655
01:03:11.656 --> 01:03:12.489
MARISHA: Okay.

1656
01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.965
LAURA: But first, let's stop and get gem dust.

1657
01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:16.668
And then go back and like, duh duh duh duh.

1658
01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:18.335
MATT: Fair enough, okay.

1659
01:03:19.872 --> 01:03:20.730
TRAVIS: My god!

1660
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:24.828
MATT: So, you, well for one thing, your ship,

1661
01:03:24.828 --> 01:03:26.953
the Balleater,

1662
01:03:26.953 --> 01:03:28.468
(laughter)

1663
01:03:28.468 --> 01:03:30.690
has been out at sea for quite some time.

1664
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:32.594
You're uncertain as to the location of it, currently.

1665
01:03:32.594 --> 01:03:34.119
TRAVIS: Remember, it's still working and moving.

1666
01:03:34.119 --> 01:03:36.051
LAURA: Oh, I thought Orly was just hanging out here,

1667
01:03:36.051 --> 01:03:37.634
I didn't think he was still going--

1668
01:03:37.634 --> 01:03:39.902
MATT: They've been doing shipping runs,

1669
01:03:39.902 --> 01:03:41.744
and bringing things up along the coast,

1670
01:03:41.744 --> 01:03:43.586
earning you guys money while you've been away.

1671
01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:44.554
LAURA: Oh!

1672
01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:45.604
TRAVIS: Passive income, y'all.

1673
01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:47.304
LAURA: He's been getting us money, too?

1674
01:03:47.304 --> 01:03:49.085
TRAVIS: We might as well just buy Nicodranas.

1675
01:03:49.085 --> 01:03:52.744
LAURA: Fuck, let's go check in and see what we got!

1676
01:03:52.744 --> 01:03:53.964
SAM: 40 gold!

1677
01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:56.968
(laughter)

1678
01:03:56.968 --> 01:03:57.918
LAURA: Okay.

1679
01:03:57.918 --> 01:03:59.778
SAM: But we don't know if they're there,

1680
01:03:59.778 --> 01:04:02.554
so we should go to the port?

1681
01:04:02.554 --> 01:04:03.863
LAURA: Sure.

1682
01:04:03.863 --> 01:04:04.732
SAM: All right.

1683
01:04:04.732 --> 01:04:06.063
We'll go to the docks.

1684
01:04:06.063 --> 01:04:08.617
LAURA: How much diamond dust did I need for constitution?

1685
01:04:08.617 --> 01:04:11.296
MATT: Constitution would've been--
SAM: We'll see if our boat's there.

1686
01:04:11.296 --> 01:04:14.483
MARISHA: We need to see if Orly is, has stuff.

1687
01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:15.316
TRAVIS: Okay.

1688
01:04:16.456 --> 01:04:19.917
MARISHA: In case he's like, oh, I happened to come across

1689
01:04:19.917 --> 01:04:21.725
25 gold.

1690
01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:24.945
MATT: Constitution would be 2500 gold worth of diamond dust.

1691
01:04:24.945 --> 01:04:28.165
TALIESIN: Stat bumps are 2500, resistances are five.

1692
01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:29.818
MATT: Some of them are 2200.

1693
01:04:29.818 --> 01:04:31.989
Strength and dexterity are 22,

1694
01:04:31.989 --> 01:04:33.629
wisdom, charisma are 22.

1695
01:04:33.629 --> 01:04:35.516
Constitution, intelligence are, intelligence--

1696
01:04:35.516 --> 01:04:40.397
so they're all 22 except for constitution, which is 25.

1697
01:04:40.397 --> 01:04:41.230
LAURA: I need it.

1698
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:42.298
TALIESIN: And then the resistances are five.

1699
01:04:42.298 --> 01:04:43.875
MATT: Five, yes.

1700
01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:46.007
But that is a permanent resistance to a specific damage.

1701
01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:47.328
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's impressive.

1702
01:04:47.328 --> 01:04:49.683
TRAVIS: Leave the Tide Peak,
I'm going to head towards the port.

1703
01:04:49.683 --> 01:04:50.516
MATT: All right.

1704
01:04:50.516 --> 01:04:53.325
So you guys make your way towards, there are two ports,

1705
01:04:53.325 --> 01:04:54.358
if you recall.

1706
01:04:54.358 --> 01:04:55.191
TRAVIS: I know.

1707
01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:58.713
MATT: There's the Open Quay [key].

1708
01:04:58.713 --> 01:04:59.546
SAM: Yep.

1709
01:04:59.546 --> 01:05:01.566
MATT: So as not to make people hate me for forever.

1710
01:05:01.566 --> 01:05:02.956
SAM: Oh, the Open Quay [kway], you mean?

1711
01:05:02.956 --> 01:05:03.876
MATT: That one.

1712
01:05:03.876 --> 01:05:04.886
SAM: Or the Restless Wharf?

1713
01:05:04.886 --> 01:05:06.354
LIAM: But they're both correct, we learned that.

1714
01:05:06.354 --> 01:05:07.187
We did.

1715
01:05:07.187 --> 01:05:08.020
They're both correct.

1716
01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:08.853
MATT: True.

1717
01:05:08.853 --> 01:05:11.604
And I've used both, so there you go.

1718
01:05:11.604 --> 01:05:14.604
A gift to everyone on the internet to not be too angry.

1719
01:05:14.604 --> 01:05:16.204
Or everyone's angry, I don't know.

1720
01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:19.375
I'm used to it at this point.

1721
01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:20.844
Or there's the Restless Wharf.

1722
01:05:20.844 --> 01:05:23.175
The Open Quay is the one you're closest to.

1723
01:05:23.175 --> 01:05:25.463
That's the one that's actually owned by Yussa.

1724
01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:28.074
Yussa oversees this entire section of the city

1725
01:05:28.074 --> 01:05:29.674
and keeps it away from the guilds that run

1726
01:05:29.674 --> 01:05:30.648
the rest of Nicodranas.

1727
01:05:30.648 --> 01:05:31.481
TRAVIS: Let's go there.

1728
01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:32.729
LAURA: Yeah, let's go to that one.

1729
01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:33.718
MATT: Mkay.

1730
01:05:33.718 --> 01:05:35.950
LAURA: Where did we leave Orly?

1731
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:38.110
MATT: Restless Wharf.

1732
01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:38.978
But,

1733
01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:42.114
as you approach the seaside, you look out for the ship.

1734
01:05:42.114 --> 01:05:46.651
Who wants to keep, who wants to look for the Ball-Eater?

1735
01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:47.759
LAURA: I'll look!
TALIESIN: I'll look.

1736
01:05:47.759 --> 01:05:50.167
MATT: All right, both of you guys make perception checks.

1737
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:53.703
TALIESIN: 19.

1738
01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.838
LAURA: 11.

1739
01:05:55.838 --> 01:05:57.317
MATT: Okay.

1740
01:05:57.317 --> 01:05:58.220
You look out for a bit,

1741
01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.037
and it's just now, the sun's getting a little

1742
01:06:01.037 --> 01:06:03.398
high in the sky, and as such, the brightness

1743
01:06:03.398 --> 01:06:06.217
of just off the surface of the water itself

1744
01:06:06.217 --> 01:06:08.408
blinds you a bit, but some of the reflections

1745
01:06:08.408 --> 01:06:10.717
catch you from the waves that are coming in.

1746
01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:12.588
Caduceus, you do see the Ball-Eater,

1747
01:06:12.588 --> 01:06:14.457
and it is heading out.

1748
01:06:14.457 --> 01:06:17.105
It is maybe a half mile out of port.

1749
01:06:17.105 --> 01:06:18.487
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's--
TRAVIS: Caleb, Fireball.

1750
01:06:18.487 --> 01:06:20.534
LAURA: Oh, no, I send a message!
(laughter)

1751
01:06:20.534 --> 01:06:23.050
I send a message to Orly!

1752
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:24.027
Orly!

1753
01:06:24.027 --> 01:06:24.860
Come back!

1754
01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.195
We are here in Nicodranas and we see the Ball-Eater

1755
01:06:27.195 --> 01:06:30.974
and you're sailing away. Are you-- come back!

1756
01:06:30.974 --> 01:06:33.315
Because we want to talk to you!

1757
01:06:33.315 --> 01:06:34.744
MARISHA: ♪ Orly, come back! ♪

1758
01:06:34.744 --> 01:06:36.055
LAURA: ♪ Orly, come back! ♪

1759
01:06:36.971 --> 01:06:38.254
TRAVIS: Aw jeez.
MATT: The voice comes back.

1760
01:06:38.254 --> 01:06:39.903
(laughter)

1761
01:06:39.903 --> 01:06:41.016
MATT: Returning.

1762
01:06:41.016 --> 01:06:43.439
(laughter)

1763
01:06:43.439 --> 01:06:45.687
MATT: "Oh, it's been a while."

1764
01:06:45.687 --> 01:06:47.506
(laughter)

1765
01:06:47.506 --> 01:06:50.631
MATT: "Yeah, it's good to hear your voice there,

1766
01:06:50.631 --> 01:06:53.331
"Mmmm...

1767
01:06:53.331 --> 01:06:54.689
"M'lady.

1768
01:06:55.687 --> 01:06:59.343
"We'll go ahead and turn that around for ya.

1769
01:06:59.343 --> 01:07:02.427
"Give us a m-m-moment."

1770
01:07:02.427 --> 01:07:04.857
And you see the ship slowly begin to turn,

1771
01:07:04.857 --> 01:07:06.856
making its way back towards--

1772
01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.707
TALIESIN: It's really calming to watch.

1773
01:07:08.707 --> 01:07:10.289
LAURA: He's on his way back!

1774
01:07:10.289 --> 01:07:14.746
MATT: For the purposes of searching for gems,

1775
01:07:14.746 --> 01:07:18.238
per gem, per gem, you probably couldn't find

1776
01:07:18.238 --> 01:07:21.417
more than 3,000 gold worth of it to be ground into dust,

1777
01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:23.055
and it's a strange request to purchase gems

1778
01:07:23.055 --> 01:07:25.057
from a jeweler and be like, thank you,

1779
01:07:25.057 --> 01:07:26.369
can you grind it up for me, too?

1780
01:07:26.369 --> 01:07:27.307
(laughter)

1781
01:07:27.307 --> 01:07:30.007
MATT: I mean, sure.

1782
01:07:30.007 --> 01:07:32.457
But that means, with what's available in Nicodranas,

1783
01:07:32.457 --> 01:07:34.267
you couldn't double up on a statistic.

1784
01:07:34.267 --> 01:07:35.100
MARISHA: Right.

1785
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.098
LAURA: Okay.

1786
01:07:36.098 --> 01:07:38.139
Who wants what?

1787
01:07:38.139 --> 01:07:40.690
SAM: Do we have enough money to get everything?

1788
01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.928
Like, one of every gem?

1789
01:07:42.928 --> 01:07:44.939
LAURA: Well, if you guys pick what you want

1790
01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:45.772
and we can--

1791
01:07:45.772 --> 01:07:47.227
TALIESIN: I don't need anything. I'm fine.

1792
01:07:47.227 --> 01:07:48.827
LAURA: I want to get constitution.

1793
01:07:48.827 --> 01:07:51.968
MARISHA: I want wisdom, get my ki saving throw up.

1794
01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:54.259
TRAVIS: Y'all are spending 2,500 gold each?

1795
01:07:54.259 --> 01:07:55.617
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1796
01:07:55.617 --> 01:07:56.450
TRAVIS: Just checking.

1797
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:57.591
MARISHA: It's like half of what we just made.

1798
01:07:57.591 --> 01:07:58.667
LAURA: But it's a stat, man!

1799
01:07:58.667 --> 01:07:59.500
MARISHA: Yeah!

1800
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.333
LAURA: It's a full point.

1801
01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:01.747
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

1802
01:08:01.747 --> 01:08:04.139
MARISHA: You could bump some shit up.

1803
01:08:04.139 --> 01:08:06.638
LAURA: Can you increase anything and go to evens?

1804
01:08:06.638 --> 01:08:08.049
TRAVIS: I'm kind of perfect.

1805
01:08:08.049 --> 01:08:09.099
TALIESIN: I'm pretty happy.

1806
01:08:09.099 --> 01:08:11.994
TRAVIS: I'm just going to wait for
a sword of infinite healing.

1807
01:08:11.994 --> 01:08:15.985
SAM: Matt, the resistances are damage type resistances?

1808
01:08:15.985 --> 01:08:17.276
MATT: Yes.

1809
01:08:17.276 --> 01:08:19.436
Fire and cold are the two you can choose.

1810
01:08:20.328 --> 01:08:22.859
SAM: Should I do strength or charisma?

1811
01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:25.619
LAURA: Charisma.

1812
01:08:25.619 --> 01:08:26.910
SAM: I mean-- (laughs)

1813
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:28.470
LAURA: Like, seriously.

1814
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.118
SAM: Uh, okay, I'll do charisma.

1815
01:08:31.118 --> 01:08:32.190
MATT: Okay.

1816
01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:36.118
(laughter)

1817
01:08:36.118 --> 01:08:36.951
MATT: All righty.

1818
01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:40.451
So, for those who have decided to possibly get

1819
01:08:40.451 --> 01:08:43.683
a tattoo from Orly--

1820
01:08:43.683 --> 01:08:44.860
SAM: Possibly get a tattoo.

1821
01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.550
TRAVIS: Fucking group tattoos are always the shit draw.

1822
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:47.806
(laughter)

1823
01:08:47.806 --> 01:08:49.545
SAM: Should we all get the same design?

1824
01:08:49.545 --> 01:08:50.837
LAURA: Or should we get something similar?

1825
01:08:50.837 --> 01:08:52.575
(laughter)

1826
01:08:52.575 --> 01:08:53.803
SAM: Beauregard, should we get one of which--

1827
01:08:53.803 --> 01:08:55.197
what should the design be?

1828
01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:56.030
Oh!

1829
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:57.295
It's the girl-- we're all going to get--

1830
01:08:57.295 --> 01:08:59.386
it's a girl's tattoo day!

1831
01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:00.335
MARSISHA: Wait, is it just the three of us?

1832
01:09:00.335 --> 01:09:02.016
SAM: Yeah, yeah!

1833
01:09:02.016 --> 01:09:03.584
LAURA: Caleb, are you getting anything?

1834
01:09:03.584 --> 01:09:04.996
TRAVIS: Everybody sticks around for the first one.

1835
01:09:04.996 --> 01:09:06.284
SAM: Should we do Chaos Crew?

1836
01:09:06.284 --> 01:09:07.333
Chaos Crew!

1837
01:09:07.333 --> 01:09:08.677
MARISHA: Fuck, that's pretty good.

1838
01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:09.546
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

1839
01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:11.757
MATT: As a note, it's not just a single tattoo,

1840
01:09:11.757 --> 01:09:13.895
it's a series of tattoos that have to cover

1841
01:09:13.895 --> 01:09:16.677
enough of your body to actually have an impact.

1842
01:09:16.677 --> 01:09:18.255
Depending on what you get, like for wisdom,

1843
01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:20.917
it's probably going to be more like a back of the neck.

1844
01:09:20.917 --> 01:09:21.986
LAURA: Oh, that's tight.

1845
01:09:21.986 --> 01:09:23.277
MARISHA: Exactly what I was thinking.

1846
01:09:23.277 --> 01:09:25.234
MATT: Yeah, back of the neck to shoulders.

1847
01:09:25.234 --> 01:09:26.845
For constitution, it's probably going to be

1848
01:09:26.845 --> 01:09:28.465
shoulders and chest, you know.

1849
01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:29.660
MARISHA: Oh!

1850
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.695
LAURA: I wonder if he can make--

1851
01:09:30.695 --> 01:09:33.085
MATT: And you're getting charisma?

1852
01:09:33.085 --> 01:09:34.093
Really, it's your choice.

1853
01:09:34.093 --> 01:09:34.926
SAM: It's a face tattoo?

1854
01:09:34.926 --> 01:09:35.759
MARISHA: A face tattoo!

1855
01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:37.045
MATT: You can if you want to!

1856
01:09:37.045 --> 01:09:39.045
SAM: What are the options?

1857
01:09:39.045 --> 01:09:42.023
MATT: For charisma, I mean, it could either

1858
01:09:42.023 --> 01:09:43.513
be looks or so, it could be something

1859
01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:47.058
that like frames the face in a beautiful way.

1860
01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:50.370
It can be less like a visual ink tattoo

1861
01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:52.581
and more like, you know, those invisible, minor

1862
01:09:52.581 --> 01:09:54.521
body modifications that are more like

1863
01:09:54.521 --> 01:09:58.181
skin color designs and stuff you can put in.

1864
01:09:58.181 --> 01:09:59.311
Charisma's a little more amorphous,

1865
01:09:59.311 --> 01:10:00.722
because it's not actually a location-based thing,

1866
01:10:00.722 --> 01:10:01.555
it's more personality,

1867
01:10:01.555 --> 01:10:02.388
so that's a little more interpretive.

1868
01:10:02.388 --> 01:10:03.221
SAM: And which gem

1869
01:10:03.221 --> 01:10:04.762
is associated with charisma?

1870
01:10:04.762 --> 01:10:06.311
MATT: Charisma is aquamarine dust.

1871
01:10:06.311 --> 01:10:07.240
LAURA: Ooh!

1872
01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.991
That would be so pretty with your skin, Nott!

1873
01:10:09.991 --> 01:10:12.581
SAM: My ugly skin, yes, it would be very pretty.

1874
01:10:12.581 --> 01:10:15.885
LAURA: I wonder if, when you change back,

1875
01:10:15.885 --> 01:10:18.431
if the tattoo will stay?

1876
01:10:18.431 --> 01:10:19.681
SAM: I don't know.

1877
01:10:21.181 --> 01:10:23.762
I guess there's only one way to find out.

1878
01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:25.970
LAURA: I bet Caleb can make it happen.

1879
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:27.770
You're so smart.

1880
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:28.603
SAM: He is.

1881
01:10:28.603 --> 01:10:30.770
LIAM: She and I will work together.

1882
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:32.270
SAM: All right.

1883
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.981
TRAVIS: Did you find all your gems yet?

1884
01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:35.311
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1885
01:10:35.311 --> 01:10:36.610
MATT: So we'll say, you guys--

1886
01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:37.454
TALIESIN: Ground them up.

1887
01:10:37.454 --> 01:10:40.054
MATT: Asking around, it takes, you know,

1888
01:10:40.054 --> 01:10:41.601
say an hour and a half to two hours,

1889
01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:44.973
so you're in the early to mid afternoon now.

1890
01:10:44.973 --> 01:10:46.423
By the time you acquire the gems you require

1891
01:10:46.423 --> 01:10:48.934
and have them ground up based on the specifications

1892
01:10:48.934 --> 01:10:50.574
that Orly last left you, and by the time you have come

1893
01:10:50.574 --> 01:10:53.963
to this point, you wait about 25, 30 minutes or so

1894
01:10:53.963 --> 01:10:56.750
for the ship to turn around and make its way back to port.

1895
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.152
As it comes in, the bell rings, the ropes come off,

1896
01:10:59.152 --> 01:11:01.374
the crew come over the side of the ship

1897
01:11:01.374 --> 01:11:03.094
and moor to the dock,

1898
01:11:03.094 --> 01:11:05.172
and begin to wave to you,

1899
01:11:05.172 --> 01:11:06.462
faces you haven't seen in a while.

1900
01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.923
Some new faces, some old ones from when you made

1901
01:11:08.923 --> 01:11:11.572
your journey through the Lucidian Ocean

1902
01:11:11.572 --> 01:11:14.561
and the Menagerie Coast, to and from Darktow.

1903
01:11:14.561 --> 01:11:17.032
And there you see coming off the edge of the ship,

1904
01:11:17.032 --> 01:11:21.982
the large gnarled, hard shell of Orly,

1905
01:11:21.982 --> 01:11:26.675
eye patch adorned, smiling from beneath the tortle grin,

1906
01:11:26.675 --> 01:11:28.652
lumbers over to each of you,

1907
01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:31.082
and as he steps off the ship, he grabs the edge

1908
01:11:31.082 --> 01:11:35.900
of his bagpipes-type scenario.

1909
01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.071
And gives the (imitates bagpipes)

1910
01:11:38.071 --> 01:11:40.122
sound that is the decree of

1911
01:11:40.122 --> 01:11:42.180
the ship's arrival to dock

1912
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:45.440
that they've become used to here in Nicodranas.

1913
01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.140
As Orly approaches and goes up to you first,

1914
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.522
Captain Tusktooth, and goes--

1915
01:11:50.522 --> 01:11:51.891
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

1916
01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.384
MATT: "Here you are!

1917
01:11:53.384 --> 01:11:54.852
"Been too long."

1918
01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:56.522
TRAVIS: Yes, it's lovely to see you, Orly.

1919
01:11:56.522 --> 01:11:58.622
MATT: Clasps your hand.

1920
01:11:58.622 --> 01:12:01.681
"So, how goes the

1921
01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:06.681
"m-m-majority of your adventures?"

1922
01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.854
TRAVIS: They've been thrilling. We've learned,

1923
01:12:09.854 --> 01:12:14.348
we've seen, and we've grown. How fares the Ball-Eater?

1924
01:12:14.348 --> 01:12:16.163
MATT: "Not terribly!

1925
01:12:16.163 --> 01:12:17.921
"We've been doing business

1926
01:12:17.921 --> 01:12:21.996
"all up and down the Menagerie Coast.

1927
01:12:23.054 --> 01:12:27.470
"Got all sorts of m-money for you."

1928
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:28.622
TRAVIS: Oh really?

1929
01:12:28.622 --> 01:12:30.091
MATT: (whistles) He gives a big whistle,

1930
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:31.610
and they bring a small chest off the edge

1931
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:32.512
and drop it down.

1932
01:12:32.512 --> 01:12:33.552
LAURA: Whoa!

1933
01:12:33.552 --> 01:12:37.503
MATT: Which, delivering to you guys

1934
01:12:37.503 --> 01:12:40.161
what now accounts for

1935
01:12:40.161 --> 01:12:42.969
1,312 gold pieces

1936
01:12:42.969 --> 01:12:45.742
has been your split of the money they've made

1937
01:12:45.742 --> 01:12:47.675
since you've last left them.

1938
01:12:47.675 --> 01:12:48.508
Yes.

1939
01:12:48.508 --> 01:12:50.203
MARISHA: Did you guys take out your money for your gem dust?

1940
01:12:50.203 --> 01:12:51.036
SAM: I just did, yeah.

1941
01:12:51.036 --> 01:12:51.869
MARISHA: It was 2,200?

1942
01:12:51.869 --> 01:12:52.843
SAM: 2,500.

1943
01:12:52.843 --> 01:12:54.424
MARISHA: I thought 2,500 was for diamonds.

1944
01:12:54.424 --> 01:12:55.264
TALIESIN: 22 for--

1945
01:12:55.264 --> 01:12:56.675
LAURA: Yeah, you guys, it's 22.

1946
01:12:56.675 --> 01:13:01.675
MATT: "War time m-makes for very nice profits."

1947
01:13:02.243 --> 01:13:06.293
TRAVIS: We'll take 150 gold out of that pile

1948
01:13:06.293 --> 01:13:08.464
and leave it for Orly, yes?

1949
01:13:08.464 --> 01:13:09.555
LAURA: Oh yes.

1950
01:13:09.555 --> 01:13:11.254
MARISHA: Yes, so wait for that back.

1951
01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:14.454
MATT: "Oh, no need, cap'n.

1952
01:13:14.454 --> 01:13:16.304
"That is your split.

1953
01:13:16.304 --> 01:13:19.832
"We've already been paid from the money that was--"

1954
01:13:19.832 --> 01:13:20.744
LAURA: 280.

1955
01:13:20.744 --> 01:13:22.052
MATT: "--made."

1956
01:13:23.958 --> 01:13:26.957
MARISHA: Are going to tip-- are we going to tip him or not?

1957
01:13:26.957 --> 01:13:31.482
SAM: Orly, we've come to get some ink.

1958
01:13:31.482 --> 01:13:36.482
MATT: "(laughs) I was wondering when y'all be coming 'round

1959
01:13:36.677 --> 01:13:38.543
"and getting yourself some

1960
01:13:38.543 --> 01:13:42.559
"m-mighty fine ink!"

1961
01:13:42.559 --> 01:13:43.856
(laughter)

1962
01:13:43.856 --> 01:13:45.656
MATT: "Let me get my

1963
01:13:45.656 --> 01:13:48.334
m-m-materials."

1964
01:13:48.334 --> 01:13:49.566
He goes back on to the ship

1965
01:13:49.566 --> 01:13:52.936
and eventually sets up on the deck of the Ball-Eater,

1966
01:13:52.936 --> 01:13:56.524
a table, some sort of a strange,

1967
01:13:56.524 --> 01:13:59.267
it's half an alchemical contraption,

1968
01:13:59.267 --> 01:14:03.541
and part of it is some strange tinkered mechanism.

1969
01:14:03.541 --> 01:14:05.829
At the end of it, you can see

1970
01:14:05.829 --> 01:14:10.169
a sort of needle element that rotates on a gear

1971
01:14:10.169 --> 01:14:15.169
and then as he tends to wind it up almost like a loom,

1972
01:14:15.728 --> 01:14:18.808
it begins to, tik-tik-tik-tik-tik, rather rapidly.

1973
01:14:18.808 --> 01:14:21.937
TRAVIS: Orly, can we ask, how painful is this procedure?

1974
01:14:21.937 --> 01:14:24.958
MATT: "(laughs) Quite."

1975
01:14:24.958 --> 01:14:27.976
TRAVIS: When was the last time you did one of these tattoos?

1976
01:14:27.976 --> 01:14:29.147
Is it a common thing?

1977
01:14:29.147 --> 01:14:30.688
MATT: "This one?

1978
01:14:30.688 --> 01:14:31.787
"Quite a while."

1979
01:14:31.787 --> 01:14:33.488
(laughter)

1980
01:14:33.488 --> 01:14:35.254
MATT: "Regular

1981
01:14:35.254 --> 01:14:38.062
"m-m-maybe a week."

1982
01:14:38.062 --> 01:14:40.215
He points over to one of the other deck hands

1983
01:14:40.215 --> 01:14:43.495
who looks young, fresh-faced, one you haven't met yet,

1984
01:14:43.495 --> 01:14:45.717
who waves, and goes, (winces)

1985
01:14:45.717 --> 01:14:46.797
and you can see on his arm,

1986
01:14:46.797 --> 01:14:48.306
there's still a fresh red,

1987
01:14:48.306 --> 01:14:49.757
somewhat swollen tattoo on the arm.

1988
01:14:49.757 --> 01:14:51.288
MARISHA: Is it infected?

1989
01:14:51.288 --> 01:14:52.471
Is that infected?

1990
01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:55.220
MATT: "(clears throat) He's just, hmm,

1991
01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.536
"mmm,

1992
01:14:58.261 --> 01:14:59.836
"mmm,

1993
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:02.603
"pansy."

1994
01:15:02.603 --> 01:15:04.199
(laughter)

1995
01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:05.224
MARISHA: Okay.

1996
01:15:06.690 --> 01:15:08.570
TRAVIS: I totally want to stick around for this.

1997
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.911
I may go get some fish and chips.

1998
01:15:10.911 --> 01:15:13.981
I'll see you in what, call it two and a half hours?

1999
01:15:13.981 --> 01:15:15.350
SAM: Couple hours, yeah?

2000
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:16.610
MARISHA: May be a little bit.

2001
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:17.909
LIAM: I will join you.

2002
01:15:17.909 --> 01:15:19.690
TALIESIN: I'll take some chips.

2003
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:21.916
LAURA: Aww, they're not going to stay
and watch us get tattoos?

2004
01:15:21.916 --> 01:15:23.269
MARISHA: Fuck that, it's girl time!

2005
01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.841
ALL: Girl time!

2006
01:15:24.841 --> 01:15:25.674
MARISHA: Girl time!

2007
01:15:25.674 --> 01:15:26.507
LAURA: Get out!

2008
01:15:26.507 --> 01:15:27.469
Girl time!

2009
01:15:27.469 --> 01:15:29.509
MARISHA: I belly whack Nott.

2010
01:15:29.509 --> 01:15:30.342
SAM: Woo!

2011
01:15:30.342 --> 01:15:31.421
MARISHA: Yeah!

2012
01:15:31.421 --> 01:15:32.254
Hyuh!

2013
01:15:32.254 --> 01:15:33.454
TRAVIS: Make a dexterity save.

2014
01:15:33.454 --> 01:15:34.999
(laughter)

2015
01:15:34.999 --> 01:15:35.839
SAM: Aaah!
TRAVIS: Those abs are lethal.

2016
01:15:35.839 --> 01:15:37.009
(laughter)

2017
01:15:37.009 --> 01:15:39.170
TRAVIS: Boom, ahh!

2018
01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:42.267
TALIESIN: Arm bone breaks between two abs.
TRAVIS: Abs of death.

2019
01:15:42.267 --> 01:15:43.959
Drop to zero hit points.

2020
01:15:43.959 --> 01:15:44.792
MATT: Oh yeah.

2021
01:15:44.792 --> 01:15:46.410
SAM: Can we, in addition to the fancy tattoos,

2022
01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:48.157
can we get just a little regular tattoo

2023
01:15:48.157 --> 01:15:49.951
to just commemorate the day?

2024
01:15:49.951 --> 01:15:51.010
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like to.

2025
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:52.119
It's easy enough to do.

2026
01:15:52.119 --> 01:15:53.202
SAM: Okay, cool.

2027
01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:55.551
MATT: All right.

2028
01:15:55.551 --> 01:16:00.551
LAURA: Oh, I was going to say, maybe
an exploding keg of gunpowder--

2029
01:16:00.581 --> 01:16:01.414
SAM: Pretty cool

2030
01:16:01.414 --> 01:16:02.605
LAURA: That's pretty cool.
MARISHA: That's kind of your thing.

2031
01:16:02.605 --> 01:16:03.660
LAURA: I know, that's what I was going to say,

2032
01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.650
that's stupid.

2033
01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:06.562
MARISHA: Not against chaos--

2034
01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:07.846
LAURA: Just Chaos Crew is--
MARISHA: Pretty good.

2035
01:16:07.846 --> 01:16:09.695
SAM: CC.
MARISHA: Yeah, CC.

2036
01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:13.031
MARISHA: Maybe you can be interlocking like a chain,

2037
01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:14.781
because we're fighting the Chained Oblivion!

2038
01:16:14.781 --> 01:16:16.242
SAM: Ooh!

2039
01:16:16.242 --> 01:16:18.431
LAURA: Like, but a broken chain, yeah!

2040
01:16:18.431 --> 01:16:19.264
MARISHA: Because we're going to break--

2041
01:16:19.264 --> 01:16:21.099
LAURA: Break the chains!

2042
01:16:21.099 --> 01:16:22.274
I like it.
TALIESIN: Fish and chips, huh?

2043
01:16:22.274 --> 01:16:24.474
TRAVIS: Yes, yes.
SAM: I'll go first.

2044
01:16:24.474 --> 01:16:25.609
MATT: All right.

2045
01:16:25.609 --> 01:16:28.151
SAM: I'll take a swig to numb the pain.

2046
01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:29.810
(laughter)

2047
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:31.402
SAM: Does he have to roll a performance check?

2048
01:16:31.402 --> 01:16:32.985
Is this going to work?

2049
01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:36.543
MATT: So, you're taking, you're getting a charisma.

2050
01:16:36.543 --> 01:16:40.351
Correct, so you take the crushed aquamarine dust--

2051
01:16:40.351 --> 01:16:44.180
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to take, I would request eyeliner,

2052
01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:46.162
permanent eyeliner.

2053
01:16:46.162 --> 01:16:46.995
LIAM: Wow.

2054
01:16:46.995 --> 01:16:49.377
SAM: That maybe sort of swirls off

2055
01:16:49.377 --> 01:16:51.257
and swirls up here.

2056
01:16:51.257 --> 01:16:53.318
MATT: Oh, that's cool!

2057
01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:54.379
Okay!

2058
01:16:54.379 --> 01:16:57.240
Yeah, that's, it's almost like a Mardi Gras mask,

2059
01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.263
but it's just your face in some way.

2060
01:16:59.263 --> 01:17:00.760
LAURA: Whoa!

2061
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.349
MATT: So, as you describe it, Orly goes like, "Hmm, hmm.

2062
01:17:04.349 --> 01:17:06.048
"That I can do."

2063
01:17:06.048 --> 01:17:08.309
Takes the dust and you see drip--

2064
01:17:08.309 --> 01:17:09.869
places it in the top of the small device,

2065
01:17:09.869 --> 01:17:11.741
it goes into this glass funnel,

2066
01:17:11.741 --> 01:17:14.480
and begins to wind it up with his large tortle foot,

2067
01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.461
and as it does, you can hear the grinding sound.

2068
01:17:16.461 --> 01:17:17.829
LIAM: Put a stick in that big goblin mouth.

2069
01:17:17.829 --> 01:17:19.131
LAURA: I want to try to learn what he's doing.

2070
01:17:19.131 --> 01:17:20.451
I'm watching everything.

2071
01:17:20.451 --> 01:17:21.617
MATT: Okay.

2072
01:17:22.741 --> 01:17:26.141
Make a perception check and an intelligence check,

2073
01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:27.808
back to back for me.

2074
01:17:29.459 --> 01:17:30.292
Perception first.

2075
01:17:30.292 --> 01:17:31.200
LAURA: Perception.

2076
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.741
Oh, come on!

2077
01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.160
SAM: Ooh!

2078
01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.570
LAURA: My perception was shit, it was eight.

2079
01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:39.949
But my intelligence

2080
01:17:39.949 --> 01:17:41.517
was 16.

2081
01:17:41.517 --> 01:17:42.637
MATT: Okay.

2082
01:17:42.637 --> 01:17:44.888
You can comprehend elements

2083
01:17:44.888 --> 01:17:47.026
of the enchantment process. You watch the device

2084
01:17:47.026 --> 01:17:49.145
as one half of it, but the other half is,

2085
01:17:49.145 --> 01:17:53.387
as he takes the extension to this strange

2086
01:17:53.387 --> 01:17:54.861
tinkered, gear-like device

2087
01:17:54.861 --> 01:17:56.400
where the needle seems to stem from,

2088
01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.821
and the small tube that draws into it

2089
01:17:59.821 --> 01:18:01.421
that blends with the ink,

2090
01:18:01.421 --> 01:18:04.739
there's an element to what Orly's

2091
01:18:04.739 --> 01:18:06.101
muttering under his breath.

2092
01:18:06.101 --> 01:18:08.931
There's a perpetual almost like a chant.

2093
01:18:08.931 --> 01:18:09.905
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: That he does.

2094
01:18:09.905 --> 01:18:13.799
LAURA: He said he would apprentice me a long time ago.

2095
01:18:13.799 --> 01:18:15.358
MATT: He probably had to remember.

2096
01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:16.469
LAURA: (laughs)

2097
01:18:16.469 --> 01:18:17.680
MATT: He's focused on the job at hand.

2098
01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.261
And then-- and while you pick up elements of it,

2099
01:18:20.261 --> 01:18:22.429
you have a hard time focusing,

2100
01:18:22.429 --> 01:18:24.221
there's so many things going on,

2101
01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:27.000
that as he begins to deliver the tattoo to Nott,

2102
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.667
you don't quite grasp the intricacies of it.

2103
01:18:32.112 --> 01:18:35.175
But describe how well you handle--

2104
01:18:35.175 --> 01:18:37.324
I guess make a constitution saving throw for me.

2105
01:18:37.324 --> 01:18:38.157
SAM: Sure.

2106
01:18:39.052 --> 01:18:40.012
I'm drinking.

2107
01:18:40.012 --> 01:18:41.095
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2108
01:18:41.953 --> 01:18:43.409
SAM: A constitution save?

2109
01:18:43.409 --> 01:18:44.723
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2110
01:18:44.723 --> 01:18:45.692
SAM: Nine.

2111
01:18:45.692 --> 01:18:46.631
MATT: Nine!

2112
01:18:46.631 --> 01:18:47.622
You pass out partway through.

2113
01:18:47.622 --> 01:18:50.501
(laughter)

2114
01:18:50.501 --> 01:18:53.151
MATT: You drink, drink to hold on and just go limp.

2115
01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:54.724
TRAVIS: She's just like, aah!

2116
01:18:54.724 --> 01:18:56.489
(laughter)

2117
01:18:56.489 --> 01:18:58.522
SAM: Aaah! Aaah.

2118
01:18:59.753 --> 01:19:01.492
MATT: The three of you guys' tattoos

2119
01:19:01.492 --> 01:19:02.742
will lead into the evening.

2120
01:19:02.742 --> 01:19:04.873
So each tattoo's going to take
a number of hours to go through.

2121
01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.033
They're not extremely elaborate,

2122
01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:07.450
but it's a lot of ground to cover,

2123
01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:10.202
or the intricacy, especially with a face based tattoo,

2124
01:19:10.202 --> 01:19:12.292
it takes a lot of care.

2125
01:19:12.292 --> 01:19:15.612
So, pushing in towards the, at this point--

2126
01:19:15.612 --> 01:19:16.913
SAM: Am I a little puffy?

2127
01:19:16.913 --> 01:19:19.462
MATT: The early onset of dusk seems to be,

2128
01:19:19.462 --> 01:19:21.292
probably start hitting about now

2129
01:19:21.292 --> 01:19:22.351
or in the next half hour or so.

2130
01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:23.934
You come to consciousness in the chair

2131
01:19:23.934 --> 01:19:26.614
on the edge of the ship, you wake up to the immediate smell

2132
01:19:26.614 --> 01:19:30.848
of ocean spray and salt in the air and brine,

2133
01:19:30.848 --> 01:19:31.854
and you glance over and see

2134
01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:35.875
this big, smiling tortle face with the one eye patch go,

2135
01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:39.700
"Hmm, some

2136
01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.533
"of my best work."

2137
01:19:41.533 --> 01:19:42.614
SAM: Oh!

2138
01:19:42.614 --> 01:19:44.454
MATT: Sits up, and you can feel already the puffiness.

2139
01:19:44.454 --> 01:19:45.394
And you guys all look at Nott,

2140
01:19:45.394 --> 01:19:46.606
and Nott is a little swollen.

2141
01:19:46.606 --> 01:19:47.723
TRAVIS: Oh!
MATT: In the face.

2142
01:19:47.723 --> 01:19:49.105
SAM: What, is it okay?

2143
01:19:49.105 --> 01:19:49.938
MARISHA: It's fine.

2144
01:19:49.938 --> 01:19:51.796
LAURA: It's really shimmery, it looks really good.

2145
01:19:51.796 --> 01:19:52.629
MARISHA: Yeah.

2146
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:53.462
SAM: I can barely see!

2147
01:19:53.462 --> 01:19:54.593
MARISHA: You've got a nice glow.

2148
01:19:54.593 --> 01:19:56.185
LAURA: Yeah. It's like natural highlighter.

2149
01:19:56.185 --> 01:19:57.694
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2150
01:19:57.694 --> 01:19:59.314
SAM: All right, I'm going to go to sleep now.

2151
01:19:59.314 --> 01:20:00.425
MARISHA: Okay.

2152
01:20:00.425 --> 01:20:01.629
We're going to get ours done.

2153
01:20:01.629 --> 01:20:03.796
SAM: All right. Chaos crew!

2154
01:20:03.796 --> 01:20:05.125
(laughter)

2155
01:20:05.125 --> 01:20:05.958
MATT: So there you go. With that completed,

2156
01:20:05.958 --> 01:20:07.544
you get a permanent plus one bonus to your charisma.

2157
01:20:07.544 --> 01:20:08.694
SAM: Yes!

2158
01:20:08.694 --> 01:20:10.145
MATT: To increase your ability score there.

2159
01:20:10.145 --> 01:20:11.265
Who's up next?

2160
01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:12.854
MARISHA: You want to go, or you want me to go?

2161
01:20:12.854 --> 01:20:13.734
LAURA: I can go next.

2162
01:20:13.734 --> 01:20:15.083
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Okay!

2163
01:20:15.083 --> 01:20:16.233
MATT: All right.

2164
01:20:16.233 --> 01:20:17.105
You walk up to Orly.

2165
01:20:17.105 --> 01:20:20.205
"So what m-m-might you be looking

2166
01:20:20.205 --> 01:20:22.745
"to put on your canvas?"

2167
01:20:22.745 --> 01:20:26.209
LAURA: Well, I'm using diamond dust, here you go.

2168
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:27.956
MATT: Places it back up into the glass vat,

2169
01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:30.259
it all begins to sift in to the machine.

2170
01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:31.159
"Mm-hmm?"

2171
01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.926
LAURA: I was wondering if you could make it look like,

2172
01:20:33.926 --> 01:20:36.652
almost like a small cape, you know,

2173
01:20:36.652 --> 01:20:38.534
like the one that I used to wear?

2174
01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:39.785
The little short one?

2175
01:20:39.785 --> 01:20:42.492
Like, covering my shoulders and my chest?

2176
01:20:42.492 --> 01:20:45.184
And then right here, I want two hands,

2177
01:20:45.184 --> 01:20:49.085
like this in front, like the Traveler is hugging me.

2178
01:20:49.085 --> 01:20:50.868
MATT: "That I can do."

2179
01:20:51.925 --> 01:20:52.956
Begins to wind up the machine,

2180
01:20:52.956 --> 01:20:55.584
you can hear the grinding sound within.

2181
01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.299
MARISHA: Yo, hands are really hard.

2182
01:20:57.299 --> 01:20:58.839
LAURA: That is true.

2183
01:20:58.839 --> 01:21:00.286
Orly's super talented.

2184
01:21:00.286 --> 01:21:01.465
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2185
01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:05.214
LAURA: Am I getting naked in front of Orly?!

2186
01:21:05.214 --> 01:21:06.172
MATT: You don't have to get--

2187
01:21:06.172 --> 01:21:09.781
LAURA: I mean, as you're doing my tattoo on my chest!

2188
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:11.694
MATT: Orly looks at you and goes,

2189
01:21:11.694 --> 01:21:14.844
"Whatever makes you comfortable."

2190
01:21:14.844 --> 01:21:17.164
MARISHA: Here. I take off my sash.

2191
01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:20.001
Tie this around you like a little tube top.

2192
01:21:20.001 --> 01:21:21.058
There you go.

2193
01:21:21.058 --> 01:21:23.325
MATT: Yeah. So you're there.

2194
01:21:25.204 --> 01:21:28.464
As you take off bits of the armor and the outfit

2195
01:21:28.464 --> 01:21:29.841
and tie the tube top around,

2196
01:21:29.841 --> 01:21:32.374
you can now see, if you guys are there, Jester,

2197
01:21:32.374 --> 01:21:36.881
as cute as she is and as billowing as her outfit is,

2198
01:21:36.881 --> 01:21:38.614
having her just there with the tube top on,

2199
01:21:38.614 --> 01:21:41.033
especially in a Beau-esque type outfit,

2200
01:21:41.033 --> 01:21:42.753
fucking ripped!

2201
01:21:42.753 --> 01:21:44.698
LIAM: Jersey Shore.

2202
01:21:44.698 --> 01:21:47.571
MARISHA: I try to make it not seem
like I'm checking her out.

2203
01:21:47.571 --> 01:21:50.062
MATT: Okay. Orly goes to work.

2204
01:21:50.062 --> 01:21:54.081
It takes about three hours to complete the process.

2205
01:21:54.081 --> 01:21:56.721
Make a constitution saving throw for me.

2206
01:21:56.721 --> 01:21:59.251
LAURA: Do I add my new modifier?

2207
01:21:59.251 --> 01:22:01.059
MATT: You do not.

2208
01:22:01.059 --> 01:22:03.935
LAURA: No! (laughs)

2209
01:22:03.935 --> 01:22:05.172
Five!

2210
01:22:05.172 --> 01:22:07.412
MATT: You're (hyperventilating).

2211
01:22:07.412 --> 01:22:09.988
LAURA: I got this, I got this, I got this.

2212
01:22:09.988 --> 01:22:10.937
(laughter)

2213
01:22:10.937 --> 01:22:13.020
MATT: You go limp again.

2214
01:22:14.532 --> 01:22:17.748
Orly catches Jester in the small of the back

2215
01:22:17.748 --> 01:22:21.331
and looks over towards you, Beau, and goes,

2216
01:22:24.188 --> 01:22:25.489
and goes right back to work.

2217
01:22:25.489 --> 01:22:27.489
It takes a little longer,

2218
01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:30.526
because he's now dealing with a rag doll.

2219
01:22:30.526 --> 01:22:35.131
MARISHA: I'll try and lift her head up occasionally.

2220
01:22:35.131 --> 01:22:37.876
MATT: The sun has set, the night has come,

2221
01:22:37.876 --> 01:22:39.914
as you come to consciousness.

2222
01:22:39.914 --> 01:22:41.585
You can see the stars in the sky,

2223
01:22:41.585 --> 01:22:45.737
a moon slowly coming up over the sea-based horizon.

2224
01:22:45.737 --> 01:22:49.977
And a slight tinge of just ever-present pain

2225
01:22:49.977 --> 01:22:51.315
across your torso.

2226
01:22:51.315 --> 01:22:53.345
LAURA: Ow!

2227
01:22:53.345 --> 01:22:55.977
MATT: Which, you look down, it's a beautiful design.

2228
01:22:55.977 --> 01:22:57.276
It's specifically what you asked for.

2229
01:22:57.276 --> 01:22:59.538
And you get a permanent plus one to your constitution.

2230
01:22:59.538 --> 01:23:00.896
SAM: Wow!
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

2231
01:23:00.896 --> 01:23:02.746
MARISHA: That's so cool.
SAM: That's huge.

2232
01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:08.426
MATT: "So there, you the last one."

2233
01:23:08.426 --> 01:23:09.259
MARISHA: I am.

2234
01:23:09.259 --> 01:23:10.246
You still up for it?

2235
01:23:10.246 --> 01:23:13.221
You've been doing a lot of work. You're not going to

2236
01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:18.221
trip on the fucking finish line?
MATT: "I been bored for m-m-many months.

2237
01:23:18.679 --> 01:23:22.504
"Nice to get the fingers m-m-moving."

2238
01:23:24.651 --> 01:23:26.289
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah.

2239
01:23:26.289 --> 01:23:28.440
MATT: "Sit down."

2240
01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.849
Give him which dust?

2241
01:23:29.849 --> 01:23:30.718
MARISHA: The jade dust.

2242
01:23:30.718 --> 01:23:32.588
MATT: The jade dust.

2243
01:23:32.588 --> 01:23:34.148
He places it in the machine.

2244
01:23:34.148 --> 01:23:36.376
Winds it up, what kind of tattoo do you want?

2245
01:23:36.376 --> 01:23:39.501
MARISHA: I pull out Molly's tarot cards,

2246
01:23:40.847 --> 01:23:43.680
and I flip through the tarot cards

2247
01:23:44.678 --> 01:23:47.947
until I find the design of the All-Seeing Eye.

2248
01:23:47.947 --> 01:23:49.433
MATT: Hmm, okay.

2249
01:23:49.433 --> 01:23:51.832
MARISHA: Because he had that on the back of his neck.

2250
01:23:51.832 --> 01:23:53.037
TALIESIN: Yes he did.

2251
01:23:53.037 --> 01:23:55.138
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Right below.

2252
01:23:55.138 --> 01:23:59.506
And then I point out the other filigree on the card,

2253
01:23:59.506 --> 01:24:01.769
and tell him to just--

2254
01:24:01.769 --> 01:24:02.602
TRAVIS: Get it.

2255
01:24:02.602 --> 01:24:04.538
MARISHA: Embellish it out.

2256
01:24:04.538 --> 01:24:06.538
MATT: "That I can do for you."

2257
01:24:07.546 --> 01:24:09.208
Now you're turning the other way on the chair,

2258
01:24:09.208 --> 01:24:11.122
as opposed to everyone else, who's been sitting in the
front of it,

2259
01:24:11.122 --> 01:24:12.202
you're actually with your chest

2260
01:24:12.202 --> 01:24:14.474
against the back of the chair, leaning forward.

2261
01:24:14.474 --> 01:24:16.533
TRAVIS: Why is Beau entirely naked?

2262
01:24:16.533 --> 01:24:18.412
(laughter)

2263
01:24:18.412 --> 01:24:20.579
MATT: It's the weirdest thing.

2264
01:24:21.802 --> 01:24:24.288
MARISHA: Straddling a chair backwards.

2265
01:24:24.288 --> 01:24:26.173
LIAM: Doing the downward dog in the middle of the wharf.

2266
01:24:26.173 --> 01:24:29.352
TRAVIS: Maybe dessert? Shall we get dessert? We'll be back.

2267
01:24:29.352 --> 01:24:31.735
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Fucking bonbons.

2268
01:24:31.735 --> 01:24:32.635
SAM: Funnel cake.

2269
01:24:32.635 --> 01:24:33.970
TRAVIS: Fuck. Funnel cake.

2270
01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:36.202
MATT: Constitution saving throw for me.

2271
01:24:36.202 --> 01:24:37.059
TALIESIN: Be the one.

2272
01:24:37.059 --> 01:24:40.871
LAURA: You've got this, you've got this.
TALIESIN: Be the one!

2273
01:24:40.871 --> 01:24:42.888
(laughter)

2274
01:24:42.888 --> 01:24:44.309
TALIESIN: You rolled a one.

2275
01:24:44.309 --> 01:24:45.939
LAURA: Oh three, you got a three as well?

2276
01:24:45.939 --> 01:24:46.839
MARISHA: Six.

2277
01:24:46.839 --> 01:24:48.464
(laughter)

2278
01:24:48.464 --> 01:24:50.319
TRAVIS: Bunch of bitches.

2279
01:24:50.319 --> 01:24:52.449
MATT: At first it feels like a tickle,

2280
01:24:52.449 --> 01:24:54.229
you're like, oh, that's not too bad.

2281
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:55.309
LAURA: You've got this, Beau, you've got this.

2282
01:24:55.309 --> 01:24:56.879
MATT: And then it turns into a burning,

2283
01:24:56.879 --> 01:24:59.138
and then it starts hitting the nape of the neck

2284
01:24:59.138 --> 01:25:00.250
where it hits the base of the skull

2285
01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:02.677
and actually tapping on the bone a bit.
All: <i>Oh</i>.

2286
01:25:02.677 --> 01:25:07.548
MATT: And the pain begins to suddenly (pulsing).

2287
01:25:07.548 --> 01:25:08.573
Blackness.

2288
01:25:08.573 --> 01:25:09.949
(laughter)

2289
01:25:09.949 --> 01:25:12.616
Void, darkness, unconsciousness.

2290
01:25:13.645 --> 01:25:15.895
You have the tunnel vision.

2291
01:25:17.126 --> 01:25:19.140
You wake up.
MARISHA: Fuck!

2292
01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.644
MATT: It's a few hours into the night, not quite midnight,

2293
01:25:21.644 --> 01:25:23.427
but it's definitely later in the evening,

2294
01:25:23.427 --> 01:25:27.574
like 10:30 or so, or 10 o'clock at least.

2295
01:25:27.574 --> 01:25:29.187
You come to consciousness, and you can feel

2296
01:25:29.187 --> 01:25:31.907
the pain in the back of your neck.

2297
01:25:31.907 --> 01:25:32.987
MARISHA: I didn't pass out!

2298
01:25:32.987 --> 01:25:34.755
LAURA: It looks so good! No, you were awake the whole time.

2299
01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:36.186
It looks so good!

2300
01:25:36.186 --> 01:25:37.019
MARISHA: Does it?

2301
01:25:37.019 --> 01:25:38.286
SAM: I can't see anything!

2302
01:25:38.286 --> 01:25:42.069
(laughter)

2303
01:25:42.069 --> 01:25:43.963
SAM: I think it looks good!

2304
01:25:43.963 --> 01:25:44.933
Is that Beau?

2305
01:25:44.933 --> 01:25:47.183
(laughter)

2306
01:25:48.155 --> 01:25:49.822
SAM: It's really swollen.

2307
01:25:52.035 --> 01:25:53.603
TRAVIS: Nott's pointing the other direction.

2308
01:25:53.603 --> 01:25:55.853
(laughter)

2309
01:25:57.164 --> 01:25:59.551
MATT: Staring at Orly, Orly just spins Nott around,

2310
01:25:59.551 --> 01:26:01.551
back towards Beauregard.

2311
01:26:03.102 --> 01:26:06.302
Finished, and it's a little sore, but you know,

2312
01:26:06.302 --> 01:26:09.179
Orly goes and takes a hand mirror that they had below deck

2313
01:26:09.179 --> 01:26:10.712
pulls it over and shows you a little bit,

2314
01:26:10.712 --> 01:26:13.654
best you can see from behind over this way.

2315
01:26:13.654 --> 01:26:15.094
From what you can see out of the corner of your eye,

2316
01:26:15.094 --> 01:26:16.910
it looks gorgeous. It's a beautiful interpretation

2317
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:18.142
of the all-seeing eye,

2318
01:26:18.142 --> 01:26:19.662
the filigree wraps around it,

2319
01:26:19.662 --> 01:26:20.963
and then comes out of each corner

2320
01:26:20.963 --> 01:26:24.071
and then wraps up over and then across the shoulder there.

2321
01:26:24.071 --> 01:26:27.232
Comes to a curl at the top of the deltoid.

2322
01:26:27.232 --> 01:26:30.254
And the very point, the filigree actually comes up.

2323
01:26:30.254 --> 01:26:31.912
You can see he had to cut and shave

2324
01:26:31.912 --> 01:26:33.796
a little bit of the hair up the back.

2325
01:26:33.796 --> 01:26:35.222
But the filigree actually spills

2326
01:26:35.222 --> 01:26:36.643
up the back of the skull,

2327
01:26:36.643 --> 01:26:38.711
and stops at the crown.

2328
01:26:38.711 --> 01:26:41.472
TRAVIS: Oh! That's fucking dope!

2329
01:26:41.472 --> 01:26:43.483
MARISHA: Taps into my spinal column!

2330
01:26:43.483 --> 01:26:44.316
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2331
01:26:44.316 --> 01:26:45.149
MARISHA: That's cool!

2332
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:46.483
MATT: So.

2333
01:26:46.483 --> 01:26:49.163
You get a plus one permanently to your wisdom.

2334
01:26:49.163 --> 01:26:51.168
MARISHA: Thank you, Orly.

2335
01:26:51.168 --> 01:26:52.001
LAURA: Nice.

2336
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:54.614
MATT: The evening is here.

2337
01:26:54.614 --> 01:26:56.344
The rest of you come back, greasy-fingered,

2338
01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:57.177
finishing your fish and chips.

2339
01:26:57.177 --> 01:26:58.504
LIAM: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2340
01:26:58.504 --> 01:27:00.294
I want to role play fish and chips!

2341
01:27:00.294 --> 01:27:02.784
(laughter)

2342
01:27:02.784 --> 01:27:03.832
MATT: All right!

2343
01:27:03.832 --> 01:27:05.343
LIAM: Back it up!

2344
01:27:05.343 --> 01:27:06.483
TALIESIN: I've rolled for vinegar.

2345
01:27:06.483 --> 01:27:09.112
(laughter)

2346
01:27:09.112 --> 01:27:10.134
MARISHA: They were out.

2347
01:27:10.134 --> 01:27:11.200
MATT: Yeah.

2348
01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.217
(laughter)

2349
01:27:14.378 --> 01:27:15.822
MATT: Is there anything the three of you

2350
01:27:15.822 --> 01:27:17.152
would like to accomplish while

2351
01:27:17.152 --> 01:27:18.262
they're getting their tattoos?

2352
01:27:18.262 --> 01:27:19.095
LIAM: I want to talk.

2353
01:27:19.095 --> 01:27:20.371
MATT: All right.

2354
01:27:20.371 --> 01:27:21.917
You do have a number of hours to converse, so.

2355
01:27:21.917 --> 01:27:22.792
LIAM: Yeah.

2356
01:27:24.697 --> 01:27:27.280
Halfway through the meal, <i>ja</i>.

2357
01:27:28.179 --> 01:27:32.750
SAM: In the distance you just hear: (screams of pain)

2358
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:33.766
TALIESIN: I think it's going well.

2359
01:27:33.766 --> 01:27:35.584
TRAVIS: "Make it stop!"

2360
01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:37.072
MATT: Whose was this, by the way?

2361
01:27:37.072 --> 01:27:37.991
SAM: That's Halas.

2362
01:27:37.991 --> 01:27:39.504
MARISHA: That's, yeah, it's Halas.

2363
01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:41.683
It was mine, I started role playing with it.

2364
01:27:41.683 --> 01:27:42.683
MATT: It's yours now, there you go.

2365
01:27:42.683 --> 01:27:44.366
MARISHA: I don't roll with it, because it's--

2366
01:27:44.366 --> 01:27:46.032
MATT: Big.
TALIESIN: Comically large.

2367
01:27:46.032 --> 01:27:46.865
MATT: Yeah.

2368
01:27:46.865 --> 01:27:47.698
LAURA: What are you talking about?

2369
01:27:47.698 --> 01:27:49.221
The big ones are fun.

2370
01:27:49.221 --> 01:27:50.821
MATT: Sorry, back to you guys.

2371
01:27:50.821 --> 01:27:55.050
You finish your greasy fish and chips here.

2372
01:27:55.050 --> 01:27:56.763
LIAM: I really wish I had fish and chips right now.

2373
01:27:56.763 --> 01:27:57.596
MARISHA: That sounds really good.

2374
01:27:57.596 --> 01:27:58.429
MATT: I know.

2375
01:27:58.429 --> 01:28:00.880
Based on the journey, the tension,

2376
01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.029
everything that's come your way,

2377
01:28:03.029 --> 01:28:07.929
it is strangely comforting, having a moment of

2378
01:28:09.579 --> 01:28:12.539
quiet to breathe along the shoreline.

2379
01:28:12.539 --> 01:28:14.179
An ocean that you only became familiar with

2380
01:28:14.179 --> 01:28:17.478
for the first time, you know, about months ago.

2381
01:28:17.478 --> 01:28:18.669
As you guys finish your meal,

2382
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:19.640
you have a moment of quiet

2383
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.890
to look amongst yourselves.

2384
01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:30.239
LIAM: Can I ask you a question, and you as well?

2385
01:28:30.239 --> 01:28:31.072
TALIESIN: Sure.

2386
01:28:33.049 --> 01:28:37.241
LIAM: I'm not a man of faith like the two of you.

2387
01:28:39.301 --> 01:28:41.051
I know that there are

2388
01:28:42.752 --> 01:28:47.752
gods on high who look down upon us and interact

2389
01:28:48.537 --> 01:28:51.787
with the mortal coil from time to time.

2390
01:28:52.976 --> 01:28:57.143
But in my life, I have only ever felt like an ant.

2391
01:28:59.325 --> 01:29:01.992
Finding my way about in the mud.

2392
01:29:03.355 --> 01:29:08.288
Certainly, no feeling of...

2393
01:29:09.146 --> 01:29:12.229
fate, no connection to that.

2394
01:29:13.763 --> 01:29:14.596
But.

2395
01:29:17.315 --> 01:29:19.648
Everything that is happening

2396
01:29:21.245 --> 01:29:23.245
with this group of nine,

2397
01:29:26.965 --> 01:29:28.548
continues to build.

2398
01:29:31.376 --> 01:29:33.959
We are so different, all of us.

2399
01:29:37.896 --> 01:29:40.813
Seemingly so little alike, and yet,

2400
01:29:42.224 --> 01:29:45.104
for the first time in my life, I can't shake the feeling

2401
01:29:45.104 --> 01:29:46.104
that we have

2402
01:29:48.273 --> 01:29:50.023
been pulled together,

2403
01:29:51.165 --> 01:29:54.582
and that is a very foreign thought to me.

2404
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:02.275
TALIESIN: I knew that you had a destiny

2405
01:30:02.275 --> 01:30:04.795
from the moment I met you.

2406
01:30:04.795 --> 01:30:07.395
It's in everything you do.

2407
01:30:08.899 --> 01:30:10.849
You are particular.

2408
01:30:15.235 --> 01:30:16.971
LIAM: I don't feel that.

2409
01:30:16.971 --> 01:30:17.804
TALIESIN: Well,

2410
01:30:19.195 --> 01:30:22.528
it's a matter of perspective, I suppose.

2411
01:30:23.453 --> 01:30:27.703
You were always moving towards something, since you--

2412
01:30:30.234 --> 01:30:32.680
since you've been who you are.

2413
01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.311
You're moving towards something,

2414
01:30:35.311 --> 01:30:36.402
right?

2415
01:30:37.864 --> 01:30:39.234
LIAM: I have been.

2416
01:30:39.234 --> 01:30:40.067
TALIESIN: Well.

2417
01:30:41.824 --> 01:30:43.241
It's kind of how--

2418
01:30:44.963 --> 01:30:46.463
how do I put this?

2419
01:30:48.864 --> 01:30:51.193
So have you ever--

2420
01:30:52.733 --> 01:30:55.115
have you ever planted a tree before?

2421
01:30:55.115 --> 01:30:59.315
Or a plant, have you ever planted anything?

2422
01:30:59.315 --> 01:31:00.744
Put anything in the ground?

2423
01:31:00.744 --> 01:31:02.493
LIAM: A long time ago, yeah, plants.

2424
01:31:02.493 --> 01:31:06.352
TALIESIN: Yeah, what did you plant?

2425
01:31:06.352 --> 01:31:07.405
LIAM: Green beans.

2426
01:31:07.405 --> 01:31:09.904
TALIESIN: Green beans, perfect.

2427
01:31:09.904 --> 01:31:14.176
So you put something in the ground.

2428
01:31:14.176 --> 01:31:16.464
It didn't look like much.

2429
01:31:16.464 --> 01:31:20.824
You knew what you were going to get at the end of it.

2430
01:31:20.824 --> 01:31:22.285
You put this thing in the ground,

2431
01:31:22.285 --> 01:31:23.895
and it's going to do what it's going to do.

2432
01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.085
It doesn't know what it is.

2433
01:31:25.085 --> 01:31:26.875
It doesn't know its purpose,

2434
01:31:26.875 --> 01:31:29.458
but it's moving to green beans.

2435
01:31:31.445 --> 01:31:33.704
The gods plant us,

2436
01:31:33.704 --> 01:31:35.445
they plant their will and their desire,

2437
01:31:35.445 --> 01:31:36.944
and we move towards the fruit

2438
01:31:36.944 --> 01:31:39.205
that we will eventually bear for them,

2439
01:31:39.205 --> 01:31:40.622
if all goes well.

2440
01:31:42.304 --> 01:31:44.245
That plant may not have made it,

2441
01:31:44.245 --> 01:31:46.795
that plant may have fallen to a chill

2442
01:31:46.795 --> 01:31:48.745
or circumstance,

2443
01:31:50.515 --> 01:31:52.312
been eaten by something that didn't appreciate

2444
01:31:52.312 --> 01:31:53.812
what put it there.

2445
01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:58.856
But destiny has planted you here and now,

2446
01:31:58.856 --> 01:32:01.656
and it hopes that you will bear its fruit.

2447
01:32:01.656 --> 01:32:03.198
That's destiny.

2448
01:32:05.564 --> 01:32:08.314
TRAVIS: Don't look at me, I'm learning.

2449
01:32:12.165 --> 01:32:14.776
TALIESIN: The tree doesn't know what it's going to fruit.

2450
01:32:14.776 --> 01:32:17.096
You don't know where you're headed, but you were put here,

2451
01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:20.525
and I've always known this, but I will admit,

2452
01:32:20.525 --> 01:32:23.163
I have never felt it, as truly as I have

2453
01:32:23.163 --> 01:32:25.904
since meeting the rest of you.

2454
01:32:25.904 --> 01:32:26.854
This is--

2455
01:32:28.204 --> 01:32:29.037
(sighs)

2456
01:32:30.283 --> 01:32:31.116
This is...

2457
01:32:33.064 --> 01:32:35.113
This is a garden.

2458
01:32:35.113 --> 01:32:36.946
This is a good garden.

2459
01:32:38.384 --> 01:32:39.717
A lot of manure.

2460
01:32:41.163 --> 01:32:45.075
(chuckles) But a good garden.

2461
01:32:45.075 --> 01:32:47.584
And what is the point of a chip

2462
01:32:47.584 --> 01:32:50.132
if not just to douse it in vinegar?

2463
01:32:50.132 --> 01:32:51.835
It's really the only point of this.

2464
01:32:51.835 --> 01:32:52.914
It's bland otherwise.

2465
01:32:52.914 --> 01:32:53.872
TRAVIS: That's true, yeah.

2466
01:32:53.872 --> 01:32:56.205
Really has no other purpose.

2467
01:32:58.721 --> 01:33:00.554
TALIESIN: Does that help, Caleb?

2468
01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:07.266
Well, at least it's worth pondering.

2469
01:33:07.266 --> 01:33:08.601
LIAM: What about you, are you ready to go

2470
01:33:08.601 --> 01:33:12.843
chasing after Tharizdun?

2471
01:33:14.808 --> 01:33:17.680
That's a real sentence that I just said out loud.

2472
01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.220
TRAVIS: You did.

2473
01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.120
You did.

2474
01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:23.770
I am not ready for that.

2475
01:33:25.469 --> 01:33:28.280
I admit, I haven't been ready for any of this.

2476
01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.009
We've just sort of been falling forward,

2477
01:33:30.009 --> 01:33:33.918
one foot catching our momentum after the other.

2478
01:33:33.918 --> 01:33:37.780
It's actually quite nice sitting like this.

2479
01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:41.020
I can't really imagine what life would be like

2480
01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:45.687
if we weren't trying to unravel this incredible mystery.

2481
01:33:47.387 --> 01:33:50.610
I'm sure calm will come again one day,

2482
01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:52.018
but until then,

2483
01:33:53.896 --> 01:33:55.896
listening to my friends,

2484
01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.740
we've been given an incredible opportunity

2485
01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.510
to affect change, maybe change the course of some things.

2486
01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.709
I don't know if we'll do it,

2487
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:11.292
I don't even know how to start.

2488
01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.389
TALIESIN: Start by helping a friend.

2489
01:34:14.389 --> 01:34:17.067
LIAM: A very large part of me still feels

2490
01:34:17.067 --> 01:34:19.509
that this is all stupid,

2491
01:34:19.509 --> 01:34:23.041
that I should run away and stick my head in the sand.

2492
01:34:24.141 --> 01:34:26.391
This is not for us, for me.

2493
01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:29.680
This is our death.

2494
01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.188
TALIESIN: Well, you are the smart one.

2495
01:34:32.188 --> 01:34:34.188
TRAVIS: You're also not wrong.

2496
01:34:35.096 --> 01:34:35.929
LIAM: But...

2497
01:34:40.308 --> 01:34:44.345
I have started to forget what it was like to

2498
01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:46.262
not be with you people.

2499
01:34:47.909 --> 01:34:52.617
And we are missing one, and I am stuck on that,

2500
01:34:52.617 --> 01:34:54.617
that we are missing one.

2501
01:34:56.765 --> 01:34:58.447
TALIESIN: It's good to know your goal,

2502
01:34:58.447 --> 01:35:00.618
to really know it.

2503
01:35:00.618 --> 01:35:01.868
It'll help you.

2504
01:35:03.807 --> 01:35:04.847
TRAVIS: I think the other part of it is,

2505
01:35:04.847 --> 01:35:07.847
if you know everything that we know,

2506
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:11.036
and you have a choice,

2507
01:35:11.036 --> 01:35:13.583
do you choose not to act

2508
01:35:13.583 --> 01:35:18.000
and sit by idly, letting the rest of your life go by?

2509
01:35:18.876 --> 01:35:21.847
Or do you act knowing full well

2510
01:35:21.847 --> 01:35:24.731
that you might fail entirely?

2511
01:35:28.291 --> 01:35:31.991
LIAM: Well, I'm at least familiar
with the concept of failure.

2512
01:35:33.371 --> 01:35:37.778
TRAVIS: I think I'm becoming comfortable
with the idea of failing

2513
01:35:37.778 --> 01:35:39.103
<i>with</i> you.

2514
01:35:40.638 --> 01:35:43.704
Makes it a little less lonely.

2515
01:35:45.121 --> 01:35:47.121
LIAM: (chuckles)

2516
01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:54.036
You two are all right.

2517
01:35:54.036 --> 01:35:56.139
TALIESIN: Getting better.

2518
01:35:56.139 --> 01:35:58.789
TRAVIS: You are as well.
You should give yourself more credit.

2519
01:36:02.872 --> 01:36:03.705
I know.

2520
01:36:05.779 --> 01:36:08.150
Just think about it.

2521
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:11.489
TALIESIN: I saw how hard it was for you in there,

2522
01:36:11.489 --> 01:36:13.156
in the ball.

2523
01:36:14.849 --> 01:36:18.249
You put others before yourself over and over again in there.

2524
01:36:18.249 --> 01:36:19.666
That wasn't easy.

2525
01:36:20.688 --> 01:36:22.605
It was very impressive.

2526
01:36:27.907 --> 01:36:29.824
LIAM: What's our next move?

2527
01:36:30.925 --> 01:36:34.258
TALIESIN: Oof. (laughs)

2528
01:36:37.126 --> 01:36:39.313
LIAM: Going to Zadash, maybe is what we will do,

2529
01:36:39.313 --> 01:36:42.417
but it is complicated for me, Fjord, to go to Zadash,

2530
01:36:42.417 --> 01:36:45.686
to speak to this man. I don't know that I can do that.

2531
01:36:45.686 --> 01:36:48.103
I'm not saying that we don't,

2532
01:36:49.235 --> 01:36:50.903
but I don't know that I can do that.

2533
01:36:50.903 --> 01:36:52.386
TALIESIN: We're going to have to protect you

2534
01:36:52.386 --> 01:36:53.519
while we're there.

2535
01:36:54.466 --> 01:36:55.666
TRAVIS: And I think we'll also need to listen

2536
01:36:55.666 --> 01:36:58.594
to what it is you want to do in case we run across

2537
01:36:58.594 --> 01:37:03.075
any of the unsavory types we've met previously.

2538
01:37:03.075 --> 01:37:06.387
TALIESIN: Specifically, the ones that have it out for you.

2539
01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:07.537
And we're going to have to get out

2540
01:37:07.537 --> 01:37:10.456
as cleanly and quickly as possible.

2541
01:37:10.456 --> 01:37:11.289
TRAVIS: Or.

2542
01:37:13.039 --> 01:37:15.182
What do <i>you</i> want to do?

2543
01:37:15.182 --> 01:37:16.737
TALIESIN: Hmm.

2544
01:37:16.737 --> 01:37:18.487
TRAVIS: Do you want to run?

2545
01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:23.509
Or find some absolution?

2546
01:37:26.131 --> 01:37:28.397
LIAM: If we go there, I want to find

2547
01:37:28.397 --> 01:37:32.088
any information from Hass.

2548
01:37:33.846 --> 01:37:35.198
And leave.

2549
01:37:37.566 --> 01:37:38.816
I don't need to

2550
01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:45.805
get my (sighs) feet wet in that.

2551
01:37:48.907 --> 01:37:50.240
We have a friend

2552
01:37:51.227 --> 01:37:54.727
who needs us and we have something bigger,

2553
01:37:57.635 --> 01:38:00.526
bigger than anything, apparently,

2554
01:38:00.526 --> 01:38:02.616
to deal with, so.

2555
01:38:02.616 --> 01:38:04.866
TALIESIN: First we save our friend.

2556
01:38:06.646 --> 01:38:08.435
LIAM: First we save our friend.

2557
01:38:08.435 --> 01:38:10.768
TALIESIN: Everything else will come.

2558
01:38:13.966 --> 01:38:15.049
TRAVIS: Agreed.

2559
01:38:17.988 --> 01:38:19.745
LIAM: I hate tattoos.

2560
01:38:19.745 --> 01:38:21.583
(laughter)

2561
01:38:21.583 --> 01:38:22.416
SAM: Ah!

2562
01:38:23.545 --> 01:38:25.420
TRAVIS: Yep.
LIAM: They're just not for me.

2563
01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:28.480
TALIESIN: They're frowned upon in my family, so.

2564
01:38:32.345 --> 01:38:34.928
TRAVIS: We pound our pints and we go.

2565
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:38.944
MATT: You eventually catch up with the ship at the dock

2566
01:38:38.944 --> 01:38:42.984
as the three ladies come back a little bruised,

2567
01:38:42.984 --> 01:38:45.784
but happy with the art that has been placed

2568
01:38:45.784 --> 01:38:46.765
upon their canvas.

2569
01:38:46.765 --> 01:38:48.194
TRAVIS: What the fuck!

2570
01:38:48.194 --> 01:38:49.422
TALIESIN: We brought fish and-- oh my. Wow.

2571
01:38:49.422 --> 01:38:51.674
TRAVIS: What is wrong with your face?

2572
01:38:51.674 --> 01:38:54.452
LAURA: She's a little swollen right now. It'll go down!

2573
01:38:54.452 --> 01:38:56.984
Don't look at the swell, look at the design!

2574
01:38:56.984 --> 01:38:57.817
SAM: Who's talking?

2575
01:38:57.817 --> 01:38:59.405
TRAVIS: What happened?

2576
01:38:59.405 --> 01:39:00.238
TALIESIN: Oh!

2577
01:39:00.238 --> 01:39:01.927
SAM: Do I look prettier?

2578
01:39:01.927 --> 01:39:03.298
LIAM: Do you want some chips?

2579
01:39:03.298 --> 01:39:05.414
TALIESIN: We brought fish and chips.

2580
01:39:05.414 --> 01:39:06.392
I'm not--

2581
01:39:06.392 --> 01:39:09.173
LIAM: I start inserting them in her mouth.

2582
01:39:09.173 --> 01:39:10.312
Carefully.

2583
01:39:10.312 --> 01:39:11.872
SAM: Ah!

2584
01:39:11.872 --> 01:39:14.713
TRAVIS: Show us the other ones

2585
01:39:14.713 --> 01:39:17.093
besides the horror on Nott's face.

2586
01:39:17.093 --> 01:39:18.442
MARISHA: Just don't touch me.

2587
01:39:18.442 --> 01:39:19.491
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
TALIESIN: Wow.

2588
01:39:19.491 --> 01:39:21.161
TRAVIS: You got a haircut at the same time.

2589
01:39:21.161 --> 01:39:22.461
MARISHA: Yeah-- oh! You piece of--

2590
01:39:22.461 --> 01:39:24.708
(laughter)

2591
01:39:24.708 --> 01:39:25.921
I punch Fjord.

2592
01:39:25.921 --> 01:39:27.841
MATT: Roll an attack roll.

2593
01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:29.521
With advantage, because he wasn't expecting it.

2594
01:39:29.521 --> 01:39:31.110
(laughter)

2595
01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:31.949
LIAM: A one?

2596
01:39:31.949 --> 01:39:33.762
MARISHA: Natural one!

2597
01:39:33.762 --> 01:39:35.371
11, So 21.

2598
01:39:35.371 --> 01:39:36.858
MATT: Roll damage.

2599
01:39:36.858 --> 01:39:39.250
Think about how hard you want to hit, it's up to you.

2600
01:39:39.250 --> 01:39:40.732
LIAM and TALIESIN: Full force!

2601
01:39:40.732 --> 01:39:42.870
TRAVIS: I just had fish and chips, bring it.

2602
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:47.391
MARISHA: No, I'm doing a d4, I'm doing a d4.
SAM: Stunning strike.

2603
01:39:47.391 --> 01:39:49.577
It's still eight damage.
SAM: Sentinel.

2604
01:39:49.577 --> 01:39:50.472
MATT: Where are you hitting him?

2605
01:39:50.472 --> 01:39:51.305
LIAM: Extract aspects!

2606
01:39:51.305 --> 01:39:52.899
MARISHA: Just in the shoulder.

2607
01:39:52.899 --> 01:39:53.732
TRAVIS: Come on.

2608
01:39:53.732 --> 01:39:55.601
MATT: You go unexpected, and not tensing

2609
01:39:55.601 --> 01:39:57.649
for any sort of battle scenario,

2610
01:39:57.649 --> 01:39:59.739
Beau turns around and clocks you in the shoulder.

2611
01:39:59.739 --> 01:40:01.590
You fall on to your hip and (grinding)

2612
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:04.938
skid across for about three or four feet.

2613
01:40:04.938 --> 01:40:06.489
That shit's going to hurt in the morning.

2614
01:40:06.489 --> 01:40:08.406
TRAVIS: I fall, and I'm like--

2615
01:40:09.259 --> 01:40:11.367
Good. That was a good one.

2616
01:40:11.367 --> 01:40:12.500
MARISHA: I honestly didn't mean to hit you that hard.

2617
01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:14.987
I feel a little bad.
TRAVIS: It's fine, no, I earned it.

2618
01:40:14.987 --> 01:40:16.252
MARISHA: You just caught me off guard.

2619
01:40:16.252 --> 01:40:17.333
LAURA: Just stay down, just stay down.

2620
01:40:17.333 --> 01:40:19.490
TRAVIS: I'll stay here. Jester, what'd you get?

2621
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:21.525
LAURA: Well, I'm still in my tube top.

2622
01:40:21.525 --> 01:40:22.766
I'm just wearing the sash,

2623
01:40:22.766 --> 01:40:24.655
because I can't put my clothes on over it just yet.

2624
01:40:24.655 --> 01:40:26.796
TRAVIS: You are fucking jacked!

2625
01:40:26.796 --> 01:40:27.629
MARISHA: Yeah.

2626
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:29.396
LAURA: Well, yeah!
MARISHA: Right?

2627
01:40:29.396 --> 01:40:30.584
TRAVIS: It's kind of ridiculous.

2628
01:40:30.584 --> 01:40:32.316
MARISHA: I mean, I've seen her in the hot tub and stuff,

2629
01:40:32.316 --> 01:40:35.716
but I think it really just highlights it.

2630
01:40:35.716 --> 01:40:37.596
LAURA: Well, it shimmers on this.

2631
01:40:37.596 --> 01:40:39.762
MARISHA: I know. I've noticed.

2632
01:40:39.762 --> 01:40:40.956
TRAVIS: It looks good.

2633
01:40:40.956 --> 01:40:42.539
LAURA: Thank you!
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2634
01:40:43.425 --> 01:40:47.074
MARISHA: And we also got these awesome Chaos Crew tattoos!

2635
01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:48.185
Look at that!

2636
01:40:48.185 --> 01:40:50.484
You can just see it right there, yeah!

2637
01:40:50.484 --> 01:40:51.433
We just decided!

2638
01:40:51.433 --> 01:40:53.099
TRAVIS: Arm tap.
MARISHA: Ah!

2639
01:40:53.099 --> 01:40:57.991
(laughter)

2640
01:40:58.953 --> 01:41:02.329
TRAVIS: I try and dodge it on the second one!

2641
01:41:02.329 --> 01:41:04.422
MARISHA: Oh, I just hold that one in.

2642
01:41:04.422 --> 01:41:06.021
MATT: All right.

2643
01:41:06.021 --> 01:41:10.332
SAM: Can we sleep on the boat tonight, Orly,

2644
01:41:10.332 --> 01:41:13.072
and then tomorrow away, or should we go to your house?

2645
01:41:13.072 --> 01:41:14.982
LAURA: Either away.

2646
01:41:14.982 --> 01:41:17.422
MATT: "Of course, it's your ship.

2647
01:41:17.422 --> 01:41:21.783
"We got rooms down below for all y'all to be sleeping."

2648
01:41:21.783 --> 01:41:24.244
TALIESIN: I apologize for putting you a day behind.

2649
01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:28.273
MATT: "Day behind? I'm happy to be seeing all of y'all."

2650
01:41:28.273 --> 01:41:29.106
TALIESIN: Appreciate it.

2651
01:41:29.106 --> 01:41:31.753
TRAVIS: Any news to be shared from the open sea,

2652
01:41:31.753 --> 01:41:33.402
anything we should know about?

2653
01:41:33.402 --> 01:41:36.001
Anything from-- what was the name of the pirate island?

2654
01:41:36.001 --> 01:41:36.834
ALL: Darktow.

2655
01:41:36.834 --> 01:41:37.667
TRAVIS: Darktow?

2656
01:41:37.667 --> 01:41:39.649
LAURA: What was the name of the pirate captain guy?

2657
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:41.622
The Darktow, the pirate king?

2658
01:41:41.622 --> 01:41:42.510
MATT: "The Plank King."

2659
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:43.927
LAURA: The Plank King.

2660
01:41:45.452 --> 01:41:48.461
MATT: "Far as I know, ain't been hearing too much

2661
01:41:48.461 --> 01:41:50.390
"from that island.

2662
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:54.701
"But the pirates be out and about.

2663
01:41:54.701 --> 01:41:58.076
"Wartime be m-m-making money

2664
01:41:58.076 --> 01:42:00.982
"for all those moving

2665
01:42:00.982 --> 01:42:02.815
"up and down the coast.

2666
01:42:04.050 --> 01:42:07.372
"That means it's extra gold for those

2667
01:42:07.372 --> 01:42:09.361
"who then attack the ships,

2668
01:42:09.361 --> 01:42:11.611
"so pirates be around."

2669
01:42:14.241 --> 01:42:17.070
TRAVIS: Well, glad to hear you're keeping safe.

2670
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:19.559
If you happen to hear any reports of giant,

2671
01:42:19.559 --> 01:42:21.292
snake-like monsters covered in eyes,

2672
01:42:21.292 --> 01:42:23.092
just be sure to let us know,

2673
01:42:23.092 --> 01:42:25.641
being set free on the seas.

2674
01:42:25.641 --> 01:42:26.542
MATT: "What?"

2675
01:42:26.542 --> 01:42:28.000
TRAVIS: Just, you know, in the back of your head.

2676
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.469
SAM and LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa!

2677
01:42:30.469 --> 01:42:32.300
MATT: "Well, sleep well.

2678
01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:35.419
"I'll come get y'all in the m-m-morning."

2679
01:42:35.419 --> 01:42:36.919
LAURA: Thanks, Orly.

2680
01:42:38.828 --> 01:42:42.569
MATT: You guys find your old places
to sleep within the ship.

2681
01:42:42.569 --> 01:42:45.900
While nowhere near as nice as the Lavish Chateau, of course,

2682
01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.568
there is a weird comfort and a flood of nostalgic memories

2683
01:42:48.568 --> 01:42:53.568
of your previous adventure here in the Lucidian Ocean.

2684
01:42:53.785 --> 01:42:58.477
Sleep comes readily to those of you who ate heavy food.

2685
01:42:58.477 --> 01:42:59.798
Becomes a little more difficult for those

2686
01:42:59.798 --> 01:43:03.260
who are undergoing now progressively heightening

2687
01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:05.020
physical pain from the tattoos you received,

2688
01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:07.289
but does eventually come to you.

2689
01:43:07.289 --> 01:43:10.258
In the morning, the swelling has subsided.

2690
01:43:10.258 --> 01:43:11.860
Still a bit sensitive, but the tattoos

2691
01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:12.929
are there and present,

2692
01:43:12.929 --> 01:43:15.980
their effects fully instated.

2693
01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:17.588
You can already hear the seagulls awakening

2694
01:43:17.588 --> 01:43:20.027
and the end of the lower decks of the ship

2695
01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:22.068
are already beginning, at least near

2696
01:43:22.068 --> 01:43:24.659
the edges of your chambers outside.

2697
01:43:24.659 --> 01:43:27.334
The heat is beginning to rise from the sun

2698
01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:31.137
upon the exterior of the boat itself.

2699
01:43:31.137 --> 01:43:32.004
The morning is yours.

2700
01:43:32.004 --> 01:43:33.097
Is there anything you guys want to do, by the way,

2701
01:43:33.097 --> 01:43:34.257
before you slept?

2702
01:43:34.257 --> 01:43:36.476
TALIESIN: No, just picking my spells.

2703
01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:37.867
LAURA: Oh, yeah, I should do that too.

2704
01:43:37.867 --> 01:43:40.427
Oh my gosh!

2705
01:43:40.427 --> 01:43:42.438
My hit points went up!

2706
01:43:42.438 --> 01:43:43.837
MATT: Yeah.

2707
01:43:43.837 --> 01:43:45.443
Yeah, per level, one per level.

2708
01:43:45.443 --> 01:43:46.276
MARISHA: Per level.

2709
01:43:46.276 --> 01:43:47.184
LAURA: Oh!

2710
01:43:47.184 --> 01:43:48.017
That's awesome!

2711
01:43:48.017 --> 01:43:49.501
MARISHA: Yeah.

2712
01:43:49.501 --> 01:43:52.295
TRAVIS: Is that not why you picked your constitution?

2713
01:43:52.295 --> 01:43:53.684
TALIESIN: You forget that you got all those nifty--

2714
01:43:53.684 --> 01:43:56.894
LAURA: Yeah, those little bonuses from constitution.

2715
01:43:56.894 --> 01:44:01.727
I am going to not wear my under dress on top.

2716
01:44:01.727 --> 01:44:03.118
I'm just going to wear my thing,

2717
01:44:03.118 --> 01:44:07.002
because I want to show off my awesome arm tattoos.

2718
01:44:07.002 --> 01:44:08.562
TRAVIS: There's a lot of definition where your bicep

2719
01:44:08.562 --> 01:44:10.381
meets your deltoid, it's--

2720
01:44:10.381 --> 01:44:11.588
LAURA: (explosions)

2721
01:44:11.588 --> 01:44:12.454
TRAVIS: Shit, yep.

2722
01:44:13.578 --> 01:44:16.381
Like an A on the back of her arm, it's incredible.

2723
01:44:16.381 --> 01:44:17.464
SAM: She's stacked.

2724
01:44:18.458 --> 01:44:21.397
MATT: So rest is had.

2725
01:44:21.397 --> 01:44:22.230
SAM: Caleb?

2726
01:44:22.230 --> 01:44:23.448
MATT: Consciousness comes.

2727
01:44:23.448 --> 01:44:25.328
The morning is yours, what would you like to do?

2728
01:44:25.328 --> 01:44:27.726
SAM: Shall we away?

2729
01:44:27.726 --> 01:44:29.550
How do we do it?

2730
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:31.709
By boat or by teleport?

2731
01:44:31.709 --> 01:44:33.809
TRAVIS: Definitely by foot.
LIAM: Not by boat.

2732
01:44:34.766 --> 01:44:35.915
TRAVIS: We walk.

2733
01:44:35.915 --> 01:44:39.069
LIAM: We're leaving straight away?

2734
01:44:39.069 --> 01:44:41.207
Yeah, you're good?

2735
01:44:41.207 --> 01:44:44.397
LAURA: Yeah, I think number one, I didn't tell my mom

2736
01:44:44.397 --> 01:44:46.470
I was getting a tattoo beforehand, so--

2737
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:47.418
TRAVIS: Oof.

2738
01:44:47.418 --> 01:44:49.018
LAURA: I just want to give a little bit of time

2739
01:44:49.018 --> 01:44:51.077
so I can hide it, you know, before.

2740
01:44:51.077 --> 01:44:52.445
Give her some warning.
TALIESIN: Fair.

2741
01:44:52.445 --> 01:44:54.166
MARISHA: Is she weird about stuff like that?

2742
01:44:54.166 --> 01:44:56.092
LAURA: Well, I mean--
TALIESIN: Never can tell.

2743
01:44:56.092 --> 01:44:58.132
LAURA: I never, you know--

2744
01:44:58.132 --> 01:44:58.965
MARISHA: Right.

2745
01:45:00.079 --> 01:45:03.171
Discussion was never brought up, yeah.

2746
01:45:03.171 --> 01:45:05.807
TRAVIS: Are you going to visit home
in a sweater from now on?

2747
01:45:05.807 --> 01:45:06.640
LAURA: Maybe.

2748
01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.754
TRAVIS: All right.

2749
01:45:07.754 --> 01:45:09.851
TALIESIN: Seeing people who find out their kids have tattoos

2750
01:45:09.851 --> 01:45:12.485
literally at the funeral. It's a thing that happens.

2751
01:45:12.485 --> 01:45:14.576
LAURA: Yeah, you know.

2752
01:45:14.576 --> 01:45:16.885
Plus, you know, I think it makes her sad sometimes

2753
01:45:16.885 --> 01:45:19.725
when we pop in and out so quickly and we don't stay.

2754
01:45:19.725 --> 01:45:22.205
SAM: Makes me very sad, yes.

2755
01:45:22.205 --> 01:45:24.162
TRAVIS: All right. Then let's go.

2756
01:45:24.162 --> 01:45:25.697
Back to the tower?

2757
01:45:25.697 --> 01:45:27.696
LAURA: Yeah, because you didn't even go see your--

2758
01:45:27.696 --> 01:45:30.471
MARISHA: We don't have to go to the tower.
SAM: I know, and it's painful.

2759
01:45:30.471 --> 01:45:32.440
MARISHA: He can do it here.
TRAVIS: Sure, sure.

2760
01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.781
LIAM: We'll do it on the deck.
SAM: It's painful to go and see someone for three hours

2761
01:45:34.781 --> 01:45:35.621
and leave.

2762
01:45:35.621 --> 01:45:36.632
MATT: Okay.

2763
01:45:36.632 --> 01:45:37.718
TRAVIS: I didn't know if you wanted to wait.

2764
01:45:37.718 --> 01:45:41.657
MATT: You guys make your way to the deck of the Balleater.

2765
01:45:41.657 --> 01:45:42.909
The crew are still out and about,

2766
01:45:42.909 --> 01:45:44.748
carousing on the shore,

2767
01:45:44.748 --> 01:45:48.760
as they aren't immediately heading out to sea.

2768
01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:50.749
As you gather around, Caleb takes his chalk

2769
01:45:50.749 --> 01:45:53.800
and sets the ritual ahead, begins to draw the sigil

2770
01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:57.845
on the wood deck that matches that of--?

2771
01:45:57.845 --> 01:45:58.753
LIAM: Zadash.

2772
01:45:58.753 --> 01:46:02.938
MATT: Zadash, the Valley Archive of the Cobalt Soul.

2773
01:46:02.938 --> 01:46:06.029
As you complete the final lines upon the symbol,

2774
01:46:06.029 --> 01:46:09.335
it glows for a moment. You can feel the faint hum

2775
01:46:09.335 --> 01:46:12.344
and the vibration of the wood boards beneath your feet

2776
01:46:12.344 --> 01:46:15.678
that signify that the spell is active.

2777
01:46:15.678 --> 01:46:17.738
At that point, you all start running through.

2778
01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:19.869
Caleb, being the last one to jump through,

2779
01:46:19.869 --> 01:46:22.758
you look up right as Orly comes up from below deck

2780
01:46:22.758 --> 01:46:24.269
with a couple of platters and goes,

2781
01:46:24.269 --> 01:46:27.083
"M-m-made breakfast."

2782
01:46:28.468 --> 01:46:29.885
LAURA: That is so sad!

2783
01:46:31.749 --> 01:46:32.610
MATT: And that's where we'll take our break.

2784
01:46:32.610 --> 01:46:34.519
ALL: Hey!

2785
01:46:34.519 --> 01:46:37.029
MATT: On your way back to Zadash, we'll return

2786
01:46:37.029 --> 01:46:38.698
and see what awaits you there,

2787
01:46:38.698 --> 01:46:39.938
when we return from our break.

2788
01:46:39.938 --> 01:46:42.897
In the interim, we do have our Wyrmwood giveaway

2789
01:46:42.897 --> 01:46:44.210
for the break!

2790
01:46:44.210 --> 01:46:47.498
So, this here

2791
01:46:47.498 --> 01:46:51.130
is the Corrupted Collection Master Vault,

2792
01:46:51.130 --> 01:46:52.729
available via the BackerKit of their Kickstarter.

2793
01:46:52.729 --> 01:46:54.641
For those who haven't seen it, it's this awesome

2794
01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:57.248
turquoise werewolf and skull design

2795
01:46:57.248 --> 01:46:59.676
on the front of its larger Master Vault.

2796
01:46:59.676 --> 01:47:01.300
LAURA: Their stuff keeps getting cooler and cooler!

2797
01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.289
MATT: Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

2798
01:47:03.289 --> 01:47:04.689
Yeah, you can check it now via their BackerKit

2799
01:47:04.689 --> 01:47:07.081
oo their Kickstarter that just finished around Halloween.

2800
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:08.260
But one of you guys gets to win this

2801
01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:09.569
when we come back from the break,

2802
01:47:09.569 --> 01:47:12.311
the key word for tonight is "chain."

2803
01:47:12.311 --> 01:47:14.249
C-H-A-I-N, chain.

2804
01:47:14.249 --> 01:47:15.169
TALIESIN: ♪ Chain! ♪

2805
01:47:15.169 --> 01:47:16.860

We'll be back here shortly with the winner.

TRAVIS: What's up, all you beautiful people?

2833
01:48:17.352 --> 01:48:21.432
Happy November from all of us here at Critical Role.

2834
01:48:21.432 --> 01:48:22.523
Now, you may be asking yourself,

2835
01:48:22.523 --> 01:48:25.123
Travis, why are you so excited that it's November?

2836
01:48:25.123 --> 01:48:27.032
Well, that means it's the end of October,

2837
01:48:27.032 --> 01:48:30.003
which means that it's the end of Halloween,

2838
01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:31.584
and I don't have to worry about anyone else

2839
01:48:31.584 --> 01:48:34.533
trying to jump out and scare me.

2840
01:48:34.533 --> 01:48:35.680
I need a break from all that.

2841
01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:36.915
But because it is November,

2842
01:48:36.915 --> 01:48:38.264
we wanted to take this opportunity

2843
01:48:38.264 --> 01:48:40.041
to announce that Critical Role is once again

2844
01:48:40.041 --> 01:48:43.293
partnering with the amazing folks over at OSD.

2845
01:48:43.293 --> 01:48:45.355
Now, if you guys don't know what OSD is,

2846
01:48:45.355 --> 01:48:46.850
they are an amazing charity

2847
01:48:46.850 --> 01:48:49.605
that supports military service members and their families,

2848
01:48:49.605 --> 01:48:51.736
whether in active duty or in civilian life,

2849
01:48:51.736 --> 01:48:54.485
or even the transition in between, which is so important.

2850
01:48:54.485 --> 01:48:56.187
Coming from a military family myself,

2851
01:48:56.187 --> 01:48:58.117
I've been a fan of OSD for years.

2852
01:48:58.117 --> 01:48:59.576
I've loved working with those guys,

2853
01:48:59.576 --> 01:49:01.113
and we wanted to take a moment

2854
01:49:01.113 --> 01:49:02.604
to congratulate them

2855
01:49:02.604 --> 01:49:03.571
on officially supporting

2856
01:49:03.571 --> 01:49:07.033
over a million-plus service members and their families.

2857
01:49:07.033 --> 01:49:08.222
Guys, a million.

2858
01:49:08.222 --> 01:49:10.073
That is the kind of love we need in this world.

2859
01:49:10.073 --> 01:49:13.978
These people put so much on the line every day for us,

2860
01:49:13.978 --> 01:49:15.839
we want to give back in any way that we can.

2861
01:49:15.839 --> 01:49:18.112
So all month long, charity push,

2862
01:49:18.112 --> 01:49:21.825
the link is critrole.com/OSD,

2863
01:49:21.825 --> 01:49:25.563
again that is critrole.com/OSD.

2864
01:49:25.563 --> 01:49:27.294
Again, and as always, if you're not able

2865
01:49:27.294 --> 01:49:29.873
to financially support, spread the word.

2866
01:49:29.873 --> 01:49:32.004
Share the link, let people know, right?

2867
01:49:32.004 --> 01:49:33.802
This is something that we want to do,

2868
01:49:33.802 --> 01:49:35.103
we want to give back to these people

2869
01:49:35.103 --> 01:49:39.263
that do so much for us every single day.

2870
01:49:39.263 --> 01:49:41.789
We hope we're a part of the next million for OSD,

2871
01:49:41.789 --> 01:49:44.609
and as always, thank you for your support and generosity,

2872
01:49:44.609 --> 01:49:47.889
happy November, happy Thanksgiving,

2873
01:49:47.889 --> 01:49:51.588
bring on the non-spooky holidays.

2874
01:49:51.588 --> 01:49:53.438
Love you guys.

2875
01:49:53.438 --> 01:49:55.817
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

2876
01:49:55.817 --> 01:49:59.150
BRIAN: Oh shit, are we on the internet, Dani?

2877
01:50:00.074 --> 01:50:02.998
DANI: Jerry, get the hell out of my seat!

2878
01:50:02.998 --> 01:50:05.318
BRIAN: We don't need you, Jerry, Dani's back.

2879
01:50:05.318 --> 01:50:06.288
Ah, thank god.

2880
01:50:06.288 --> 01:50:07.651
DANI: I'm back, motherfuckers.

2881
01:50:07.651 --> 01:50:09.498
BRIAN: Dani--
MATT: (laughs)

2882
01:50:09.498 --> 01:50:11.038
LIAM: Guess who's back?

2883
01:50:11.038 --> 01:50:15.938
BRIAN: I feel like I should
apologize for last week's episode.

2884
01:50:15.938 --> 01:50:18.219
Did you have a chance to see it?

2885
01:50:18.219 --> 01:50:19.445
DANI: Yeah.

2886
01:50:19.445 --> 01:50:21.885
Yeah, I did, Brian.

2887
01:50:21.885 --> 01:50:23.727
What the fuck.

2888
01:50:23.727 --> 01:50:25.586
BRIAN: This is what happens when you leave.

2889
01:50:25.586 --> 01:50:27.451
DANI: How many questions did y'all get through?

2890
01:50:27.451 --> 01:50:29.319
BRIAN: 15.
DANI: Wow.

2891
01:50:29.319 --> 01:50:33.084
BRIAN: People were saying that we
got through, like, four questions.

2892
01:50:33.084 --> 01:50:35.527
We got through more questions last week

2893
01:50:35.527 --> 01:50:37.743
than we normally do on the show.

2894
01:50:37.743 --> 01:50:38.576
However...

2895
01:50:40.047 --> 01:50:42.326
we goofed around a lot, and it was quite fun.

2896
01:50:42.326 --> 01:50:44.767
LIAM: Put the question back up, there's so much there!

2897
01:50:44.767 --> 01:50:46.517
I need it, I need it! Thank you.

2898
01:50:50.354 --> 01:50:52.162
There's so much here that I--

2899
01:50:52.162 --> 01:50:54.863
a lot is changing for him.

2900
01:50:54.863 --> 01:50:57.946
Or has changed and is still changing.

2901
01:50:59.103 --> 01:50:59.936
BRIAN: Hmm.

2902
01:51:01.554 --> 01:51:03.452
LIAM: He's very reactive in a lot of ways.

2903
01:51:03.452 --> 01:51:05.122
It's like whatever is laid out in front of him

2904
01:51:05.122 --> 01:51:08.652
in the moment that matters to him,

2905
01:51:08.652 --> 01:51:10.240
or that he can take advantage of,

2906
01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.903
or that he cares about.

2907
01:51:12.903 --> 01:51:14.994
I don't know.

2908
01:51:14.994 --> 01:51:17.823
What has just spilled out onto the table

2909
01:51:17.823 --> 01:51:20.562
is going to be a real egg scramble for him, I think,

2910
01:51:20.562 --> 01:51:24.368
because a fucking Betrayer God coming back

2911
01:51:24.368 --> 01:51:29.268
is so much more important than his bullshit.

2912
01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:33.551
And I don't know that it's going to make him

2913
01:51:33.551 --> 01:51:37.390
let go of that stuff completely, or at all.

2914
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:38.900
Or just a little.

2915
01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:42.602
But if the Betrayer God is trying to come back,

2916
01:51:42.602 --> 01:51:44.324
a Betrayer God is trying to come back

2917
01:51:44.324 --> 01:51:48.463
and just shit on existence,

2918
01:51:48.463 --> 01:51:49.954
then all the stuff that he's been chasing

2919
01:51:49.954 --> 01:51:54.296
really, even for him and his traumatized,

2920
01:51:54.296 --> 01:51:56.585
fucked-up person that he is,

2921
01:51:57.484 --> 01:51:59.594
he has to re-evaluate.

2922
01:51:59.594 --> 01:52:00.427
He has to.

2923
01:52:02.002 --> 01:52:03.855
And I don't think he'll ever let go of it,

2924
01:52:03.855 --> 01:52:06.146
and like someone who is an addict,

2925
01:52:06.146 --> 01:52:09.994
who still, every once in a while, has a weak day,

2926
01:52:09.994 --> 01:52:12.455
and is like, "I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

2927
01:52:12.455 --> 01:52:13.946
"Fuck."

2928
01:52:13.946 --> 01:52:15.316
You know, and slips.

2929
01:52:15.316 --> 01:52:19.124
I don't think that's, I don't know that he's passed it.

2930
01:52:19.124 --> 01:52:19.957
BRIAN: Hold on.

2931
01:52:19.957 --> 01:52:22.164
This character, to me,

2932
01:52:22.164 --> 01:52:23.313
and you don't have to comment on this,

2933
01:52:23.313 --> 01:52:25.564
I'm just going to flatter you for a second,

2934
01:52:25.564 --> 01:52:29.340
but to me, this character is a very interesting lesson

2935
01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:34.114
in a clinic in self-forgiveness, right?

2936
01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:37.404
And the second part of that is, because to me,

2937
01:52:37.404 --> 01:52:38.942
I'm watching Caleb's journey, and I want him

2938
01:52:38.942 --> 01:52:40.954
to become more powerful, and I want him to do

2939
01:52:40.954 --> 01:52:42.274
all these things,

2940
01:52:42.274 --> 01:52:44.154
but at the end of the day,

2941
01:52:44.154 --> 01:52:46.252
I don't give a shit, I want him to forgive himself,

2942
01:52:46.252 --> 01:52:47.124
because at the end of the day,

2943
01:52:47.124 --> 01:52:48.652
after all the creatures,

2944
01:52:48.652 --> 01:52:49.903
and after all the monsters,

2945
01:52:49.903 --> 01:52:53.393
and after all the stuff is done,

2946
01:52:53.393 --> 01:52:56.623
it's not going to change his opinion of himself, right?

2947
01:52:56.623 --> 01:52:58.524
And the other thing is is, people,

2948
01:52:58.524 --> 01:53:00.343
is you can get addicted to grief.

2949
01:53:00.343 --> 01:53:01.284
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

2950
01:53:01.284 --> 01:53:04.461
BRIAN: And stay in that space, and choose to stay

2951
01:53:04.461 --> 01:53:06.452
in that headspace, right?

2952
01:53:06.452 --> 01:53:09.794
And we are watching what that does to a person

2953
01:53:09.794 --> 01:53:11.712
and the internal-- and this is just,

2954
01:53:11.712 --> 01:53:13.822
this just shows how great of an actor he is

2955
01:53:13.822 --> 01:53:15.503
and how great of a role player he is,

2956
01:53:15.503 --> 01:53:18.514
and how great of a character maker you are,

2957
01:53:18.514 --> 01:53:20.614
because you think in layers like this,

2958
01:53:20.614 --> 01:53:23.674
and I think those two themes with Caleb to me

2959
01:53:23.674 --> 01:53:25.112
are the two that really stick out,

2960
01:53:25.112 --> 01:53:28.123
is the self-forgiveness, and then being sort of

2961
01:53:28.123 --> 01:53:30.163
having an attachment to the grief.

2962
01:53:30.163 --> 01:53:32.492
And the reason why he has the attachment to the grief

2963
01:53:32.492 --> 01:53:35.855
is because, that's the only emotional thing

2964
01:53:35.855 --> 01:53:38.630
that he can still have connected to the family!

2965
01:53:38.630 --> 01:53:41.268
Mourning, staying in a consistent--

2966
01:53:41.268 --> 01:53:43.343
Sorry, I'm going fucking nuts on this shit.

2967
01:53:43.343 --> 01:53:44.176
MATT: Dude, go it!

2968
01:53:44.176 --> 01:53:45.074
Go, run!

2969
01:53:45.074 --> 01:53:46.495
LIAM: These are things that I've been thinking about

2970
01:53:46.495 --> 01:53:49.903
for months and months and months.

2971
01:53:49.903 --> 01:53:52.544
And you know, I honestly,

2972
01:53:53.944 --> 01:53:55.515
I think that the loose goal for this

2973
01:53:55.515 --> 01:53:59.200
was to see what happens, and I don't know the answer.

2974
01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:00.917
I legitimately don't know the answer.

2975
01:54:00.917 --> 01:54:03.629
I don't have a spot in mind

2976
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:05.557
where I'm thinking I'm going to try to stick the landing

2977
01:54:05.557 --> 01:54:07.749
and get this perfect ending, where he's

2978
01:54:07.749 --> 01:54:09.939
completely absolved himself and has forgiven himself,

2979
01:54:09.939 --> 01:54:12.037
and it's the best life that he could be

2980
01:54:12.037 --> 01:54:14.757
and is the principal of Hogwarts, or whatever.

2981
01:54:14.757 --> 01:54:18.037
I have no idea, and it's kind of scary,

2982
01:54:18.037 --> 01:54:22.437
and thrilling, and what we love about this game

2983
01:54:22.437 --> 01:54:25.326
is not knowing, and I'm really curious to see

2984
01:54:25.326 --> 01:54:27.997
where he ends up.

2985
01:54:27.997 --> 01:54:30.037
BRIAN: What I like too, let me say one more thing,

2986
01:54:30.037 --> 01:54:31.549
is that you're not,

2987
01:54:31.549 --> 01:54:34.027
you're not railroading your own character,

2988
01:54:34.027 --> 01:54:37.458
and in my sort of newly-DM mind,

2989
01:54:37.458 --> 01:54:39.756
you know, you think about people who just go like,

2990
01:54:39.756 --> 01:54:41.797
"Nope, this is my guy, this is the story

2991
01:54:41.797 --> 01:54:43.808
"I've picked out for him, it's not going to change."

2992
01:54:43.808 --> 01:54:45.059
You're letting what's happening

2993
01:54:45.059 --> 01:54:47.019
and you're letting the other players,

2994
01:54:47.019 --> 01:54:49.706
and what they say to you affect you and change you

2995
01:54:49.706 --> 01:54:52.792
and go, this guy, he's malleable to me,

2996
01:54:52.792 --> 01:54:55.120
you know, I fucking love that, man!

2997
01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:56.661
It's cool to see.

2998
01:54:56.661 --> 01:55:00.192
LIAM: Yeah, and I had some ideas of what he would be like,

2999
01:55:00.192 --> 01:55:01.431
and really, the other players at the table

3000
01:55:01.431 --> 01:55:03.700
have kind of went, (slapping)

3001
01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:06.461
and it's also fun to get

3002
01:55:06.461 --> 01:55:07.891
knocked around in different directions.

3003
01:55:07.891 --> 01:55:08.724
BRIAN: Yeah.

3004
01:55:08.724 --> 01:55:09.557
MATT: That's the beauty of role playing.

3005
01:55:09.557 --> 01:55:11.640
LIAM: We're informing each other's characters.

3006
01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:12.898
MATT: Yeah.
BRIAN: Absolutely.

3007
01:55:12.898 --> 01:55:14.139
MATT: Just like people inform us

3008
01:55:14.139 --> 01:55:14.972
and who we end up becoming.

3009
01:55:14.972 --> 01:55:16.580
I don't know. It's beautiful.

3010
01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:17.413
LIAM: Yes, it is.

3011
01:55:17.413 --> 01:55:18.246
MATT: I love it.

3012
01:55:18.246 --> 01:55:19.079
LIAM: Aww, my goodness.

3013
01:55:19.079 --> 01:55:19.912
MATT: Oh!

3014
01:55:19.912 --> 01:55:21.629
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

3015
01:55:21.629 --> 01:55:23.956
BRIAN: Suchamantis?

3016
01:55:23.956 --> 01:55:25.589
MATT: Such a <i>mantis</i>.

3017
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:30.130
BRIAN: Suchamantis, AKA MK Frisby.

3018
01:55:30.130 --> 01:55:31.455
Let's take a look.

3019
01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.671
MATT: Aww!

3020
01:55:33.671 --> 01:55:34.504
DANI: Yes!

3021
01:55:34.504 --> 01:55:35.689
MATT: That's awesome!

3022
01:55:35.689 --> 01:55:37.060
DANI: Yes!

3023
01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:38.468
MATT: I love the post-effects on it, too.

3024
01:55:38.468 --> 01:55:39.301
LIAM: Yeah.

3025
01:55:39.301 --> 01:55:42.128
There have been a few that they've put up recently.

3026
01:55:42.128 --> 01:55:43.388
BRIAN: That's pretty awesome.

3027
01:55:43.388 --> 01:55:44.221
LIAM: Yeah.

3028
01:55:44.221 --> 01:55:46.268
DANI: They also have a really good video

3029
01:55:46.268 --> 01:55:49.489
of you doing the Wall of Fire.

3030
01:55:49.489 --> 01:55:51.447
LIAM: Of that cosplayer doing the Wall of Fire, yes.

3031
01:55:51.447 --> 01:55:53.359
MATT: That's cool.

3032
01:55:53.359 --> 01:55:54.192
LIAM: One critter's the cosplayer,

3033
01:55:54.192 --> 01:55:55.879
and another critter did all the post-effects.

3034
01:55:55.879 --> 01:55:58.515
DANI: That's @Lieutenant_Jack.

3035
01:55:58.515 --> 01:56:00.045
MATT: Nice!
LIAM: You guys fucking killed it.

3036
01:56:00.045 --> 01:56:01.387
BRIAN: AKA Bane,

3037
01:56:01.387 --> 01:56:03.359
loved him in the movie with that--

3038
01:56:03.359 --> 01:56:05.467
LIAM: (Bane voice) Yes.

3039
01:56:05.467 --> 01:56:07.691
That's Cosplay of the Week!

3040
01:56:07.691 --> 01:56:08.767
(laughter)

3041
01:56:08.767 --> 01:56:10.785
BRIAN: Say you think the darkness is your ally.

3042
01:56:10.785 --> 01:56:13.234
LIAM: (Bane voice) You think the darkness is your ally?

3043
01:56:13.234 --> 01:56:14.759
BRIAN: Yes!

3044
01:56:14.759 --> 01:56:18.452
LIAM: I've petted the good boy named Henry.

3045
01:56:18.452 --> 01:56:20.796
Bonded with him.

3046
01:56:20.796 --> 01:56:23.265
Ruffled his ears.

3047
01:56:23.265 --> 01:56:25.015
You don't know Henry.

3048
01:56:25.932 --> 01:56:29.666
MATT: I think we're finally back to those being funny again.

3049
01:56:29.666 --> 01:56:30.831
It took a while.

3050
01:56:30.831 --> 01:56:32.124
It took a long while.

3051
01:56:32.124 --> 01:56:34.284
DANI: Disagreed. That never went away for me.

3052
01:56:34.284 --> 01:56:39.284
LIAM: Ahem. (Bane voice) It's been a while.

3053
01:56:41.150 --> 01:56:44.092
DANI: Liam's just so good!

3054
01:56:44.092 --> 01:56:45.746
LIAM: It's just a cup!

3055
01:56:45.746 --> 01:56:48.246
(chill music)

3056
01:57:20.343 --> 01:57:23.373
TRAVIS (V.O.): Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

3057
01:57:23.373 --> 01:57:25.214
TRAVIS: You're not Brian!

3058
01:57:25.214 --> 01:57:26.753
What kind of black magic is this?

3059
01:57:26.753 --> 01:57:28.223
Where's my friend?

3060
01:57:28.223 --> 01:57:29.895
Where's that fucking cat?

3061
01:57:29.895 --> 01:57:31.124
Tina!

3062
01:57:31.124 --> 01:57:32.874
Tina!

3063
01:57:32.874 --> 01:57:37.874
LIAM: "Oh, shut your yap, you giant walking thug!

3064
01:57:38.061 --> 01:57:39.061
"Woo hoo hoo!"

3065
01:57:40.855 --> 01:57:44.076
TRAVIS: Well, well, who is that?

3066
01:57:44.076 --> 01:57:46.364
LIAM: "It's me, your old adventuring friend,

3067
01:57:46.364 --> 01:57:49.455
"Minnesota Jones!"

3068
01:57:49.455 --> 01:57:50.687
LAURA: Oh hey, Minnesota Jones!

3069
01:57:50.687 --> 01:57:51.770
How you been?

3070
01:57:52.907 --> 01:57:54.261
LIAM: "Darling!

3071
01:57:54.261 --> 01:57:56.810
"You made it."

3072
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:58.971
TRAVIS: You guys know each other?

3073
01:57:58.971 --> 01:58:02.412
LIAM: "(laughs) Of course we know each other!

3074
01:58:02.412 --> 01:58:04.811
"Who doesn't know the greatest realm walker

3075
01:58:04.811 --> 01:58:06.650
"in all the gameverse!"
LAURA: I'm kind of famous.

3076
01:58:06.650 --> 01:58:09.021
LIAM: "The grand titan of Ove!

3077
01:58:09.021 --> 01:58:11.267
"The mother of all critters!"
TRAVIS: The mother?

3078
01:58:11.267 --> 01:58:15.706
LIAM: "Ms. Laura 'Give Me the Fucking Harps' Bailey!"

3079
01:58:15.706 --> 01:58:18.322
TRAVIS: The mother of-- yeah, of course.

3080
01:58:18.322 --> 01:58:19.155
Of course.

3081
01:58:20.392 --> 01:58:22.762
LIAM: "I'm siphoning energy off the game soul

LAURA: Whatever you need, Minnesota Jones!

3091
01:58:44.772 --> 01:58:45.605
TRAVIS: What?

3092
01:58:45.605 --> 01:58:47.787
LAURA: What are we playing today?
TRAVIS: I will cut you.

3093
01:58:47.787 --> 01:58:49.023
LIAM: "Overcooked 2!

3094
01:58:49.023 --> 01:58:52.623
"This game is known for
bringing people together in harmony."

3095

LAURA: Oh good!

3096
01:58:53.456 --> 01:58:55.623
LIAM: "It's just that we need to get this baby cooking."

3097
01:58:55.623 --> 01:58:57.371
TRAVIS: Minnesota Jones just suggested

3098
01:58:57.371 --> 01:59:01.334
that you should find love with maybe someone else.

3099
01:59:01.334 --> 01:59:02.267
LAURA: That's crazy.

3100
01:59:02.267 --> 01:59:03.983
TRAVIS: I'mma track him down.

3101
01:59:03.983 --> 01:59:05.303
LAURA: He needs to pay.

3102
01:59:05.303 --> 01:59:08.259
TRAVIS: Yeah, I need that glove.

3103
01:59:08.259 --> 01:59:09.092
LAURA: You don't--

3104
01:59:09.092 --> 01:59:09.925
TRAVIS: That's the ceiling!

(laughter)

3106
01:59:13.342 --> 01:59:16.902
TRAVIS: Have some rice, bitches! (laughs)

3107
01:59:16.902 --> 01:59:19.041
LAURA: There's, oh god.

3108
01:59:19.041 --> 01:59:20.601
Why are we so bad?

3109
01:59:20.601 --> 01:59:22.768
TRAVIS: I don't know, it's hard!

3110
01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:25.698
LAURA: Three orders failed!

3111
01:59:25.698 --> 01:59:26.962
We only had four!

3112
01:59:26.962 --> 01:59:29.125
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3113
01:59:29.125 --> 01:59:31.405
TRAVIS: Three of the four were wrong?

3114
01:59:31.405 --> 01:59:33.579
LAURA: If we're this bad--
TRAVIS: That's pretty bad.

3115
01:59:33.579 --> 01:59:37.496
LAURA: -- at management, maybe, our poor child.

3116
01:59:38.806 --> 01:59:41.565
TRAVIS: Hey, nothing's caught fire yet.

3117
01:59:41.565 --> 01:59:44.305
LAURA: It's burning, it's burning, it's burning!

3118
01:59:44.305 --> 01:59:45.426
This is great.

3119
01:59:45.426 --> 01:59:48.093
Oh, your fucking oil is on fire.

3120
01:59:49.055 --> 01:59:49.888
TRAVIS: Well.

3121
01:59:50.834 --> 01:59:55.463
LAURA: There's a fire extinguisher-- (laughs)

3122
01:59:55.463 --> 01:59:57.001
Oh god, your whole kitchen!

3123
01:59:57.001 --> 01:59:58.503
TRAVIS: I got it, I got it!

3124
01:59:58.503 --> 02:00:00.111
LAURA: Go into the corner!

3125
02:00:00.111 --> 02:00:01.071
Oh my god.

3126
02:00:01.071 --> 02:00:02.241
TRAVIS: (screams)

3127
02:00:02.241 --> 02:00:04.281
Gotta throw, you've got to throw something in your mouth

3128
02:00:04.281 --> 02:00:05.721
but do it from right here.

3129
02:00:05.721 --> 02:00:06.554
On the count of three.

3130
02:00:06.554 --> 02:00:07.887
One, two, three.

3131
02:00:09.612 --> 02:00:10.445
Did you get it?
LAURA: No.

3132
02:00:10.445 --> 02:00:12.274
TRAVIS: I did. Ready?
LAURA: One--

3133
02:00:12.274 --> 02:00:13.690
TRAVIS: Two--
BOTH: Three.

3134
02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:14.523
TRAVIS: Did you get it?

3135
02:00:14.523 --> 02:00:15.356
LAURA: No! (laughs)

3136
02:00:15.356 --> 02:00:16.629
TRAVIS: I did.

3137
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:17.462
Come on, it's two-zero.

3138
02:00:17.462 --> 02:00:20.141
LAURA: One, two, three.

3139
02:00:20.141 --> 02:00:21.304
(gasps)

3140
02:00:21.304 --> 02:00:22.243
TRAVIS: You finally got one?

3141
02:00:22.243 --> 02:00:23.734
LAURA: I did, I never get them!

3142
02:00:23.734 --> 02:00:25.442
TRAVIS: That's amazing!
LAURA: BB!

3143
02:00:25.442 --> 02:00:28.155
LAURA: I'm just going to wash some dishes.

3144
02:00:28.155 --> 02:00:30.824
I'm so sick of your shit!

3145
02:00:30.824 --> 02:00:33.574
TRAVIS: I'll take care of everything.

3146
02:00:33.574 --> 02:00:35.403
LAURA: Go, go, go!

3147
02:00:35.403 --> 02:00:36.402
And then I'll do this one.

3148
02:00:36.402 --> 02:00:37.444
TRAVIS: Yeah, put it up there.

3149
02:00:37.444 --> 02:00:38.285
Order up!

3150
02:00:38.285 --> 02:00:39.568
Order up, I got it!

3151
02:00:39.568 --> 02:00:41.726
LAURA: Oh my god!

3152
02:00:41.726 --> 02:00:43.643
TRAVIS: Wow, you son of a bitch!

3153
02:00:43.643 --> 02:00:44.584
LAURA: This is--

3154
02:00:44.584 --> 02:00:46.251
TRAVIS: This is where, aw!

3155
02:00:48.902 --> 02:00:51.686
Damn it! (laughs)

3156
02:00:51.686 --> 02:00:53.334
Fuck! (laughs)

3157
02:00:53.334 --> 02:00:54.533
I can't grab anything!

3158
02:00:54.533 --> 02:00:55.435
I wanna grab it!

3159
02:00:55.435 --> 02:00:58.744
Fire! (laughs)

3160
02:00:58.744 --> 02:00:59.577
Shit!

3161
02:00:59.577 --> 02:01:00.410
LAURA: What--

3162
02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:02.076
TRAVIS: Fucking--
LAURA: What are you doing?

3163
02:01:02.076 --> 02:01:02.909
TRAVIS: Bitch!

3164
02:01:02.909 --> 02:01:05.424
(laughter)

3165
02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:07.423
TRAVIS: Where-- (laughs)

3166
02:01:07.423 --> 02:01:10.504
Where is the damn, give me the turkey nuggets!

3167
02:01:10.504 --> 02:01:12.754
LAURA: Order up, order up, order up.

3168
02:01:12.754 --> 02:01:14.304
(laughter)

3169
02:01:14.304 --> 02:01:15.387
TRAVIS: I'm coming!

3170
02:01:19.334 --> 02:01:20.326
I already appeared!

3171
02:01:20.326 --> 02:01:21.159
LAURA: Oh!

3172
02:01:21.159 --> 02:01:22.504
TRAVIS: We reappeared!

3173
02:01:22.504 --> 02:01:24.460
The gods are merciful!

3174
02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:26.601
This is fucking terrible.

3175
02:01:26.601 --> 02:01:28.640
Cheeto <i>and</i> carrot.

3176
02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:30.292
LAURA: Oh, and carrot?

3177
02:01:30.292 --> 02:01:32.161
A cheeto and a carrot.

3178
02:01:32.161 --> 02:01:33.144
TRAVIS: Aren't they called carrots?

3179
02:01:33.144 --> 02:01:34.535
Candy corn? What are these?

3180
02:01:34.535 --> 02:01:35.382
Oh, they're corn.

3181
02:01:35.382 --> 02:01:37.632
(wheezing laughter)

3182
02:01:42.033 --> 02:01:44.421
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3183
02:01:44.421 --> 02:01:48.902
(laughter)

3184
02:01:48.902 --> 02:01:50.020
TRAVIS: Oh no!

3185
02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:52.234
(laughter)

3186
02:01:52.234 --> 02:01:55.534
LAURA: That is so weird. That is so weird!

3187
02:01:57.247 --> 02:01:58.699
Oh shit!

3188
02:01:58.699 --> 02:02:03.699
TRAVIS: We're not-- I choked! (laughs)

3189
02:02:03.939 --> 02:02:05.189
I saw a carrot!

3190
02:02:07.459 --> 02:02:12.392
(somber Western theme)

3191
02:03:15.175 --> 02:03:16.344
(upbeat jazzy music)

3192
02:03:16.344 --> 02:03:17.197
WILL: Hey, everyone!

3193
02:03:17.197 --> 02:03:19.378
The insanely talented Will Friedle here.

3194
02:03:19.378 --> 02:03:20.517
I'm excited to announce that I have a new

3195
02:03:20.517 --> 02:03:21.887
late night talk show coming to

3196
02:03:21.887 --> 02:03:24.007
the Critical Role YouTube channel on Wednesdays

3197
02:03:24.007 --> 02:03:25.726
called Mini Primetime.

3198
02:03:25.726 --> 02:03:27.906
It's brought to you by the same creators as

3199
02:03:27.906 --> 02:03:30.963
that one show with the hippie kid with the bracelets.

3200
02:03:30.963 --> 02:03:31.846
Whatever that is.

3201
02:03:31.846 --> 02:03:32.954
Anyway.

3202
02:03:32.954 --> 02:03:35.323
My show, Mini Primetime, is a mini-painting show

3203
02:03:35.323 --> 02:03:37.095
for beginners and veterans alike,

3204
02:03:37.095 --> 02:03:39.565
where this handsome face teaches the Critical Role cast

3205
02:03:39.565 --> 02:03:41.535
how to paint their own Mighty Nein minis.

3206
02:03:41.535 --> 02:03:43.679
We're going to be focusing on specific techniques

3207
02:03:43.679 --> 02:03:45.615
like fades, small detail work,

3208
02:03:45.615 --> 02:03:47.165
and taking your mini to the next level

3209
02:03:47.165 --> 02:03:48.524
by adding your base.

3210
02:03:48.524 --> 02:03:52.074
So look for it soon on Critical Role's YouTube.

3211
02:03:52.074 --> 02:03:53.222
Critical Role, what is that?

3212
02:03:53.222 --> 02:03:55.303
What is even a critical role?

3213
02:03:55.303 --> 02:03:56.983
Oh, that's right.

3214
02:03:56.983 --> 02:03:59.316
That was the show with Kash.

3215
02:04:08.703 --> 02:04:11.786
(upbeat jazzy music)

3216
02:04:24.605 --> 02:04:25.605
LIAM: Subscribe.

3217
02:04:27.394 --> 02:04:28.977
Or don't subscribe.

3218
02:04:30.994 --> 02:04:31.827
Hmm.

3219
02:04:31.827 --> 02:04:33.660
That's not a question.

3220
02:04:35.503 --> 02:04:37.415
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

3221
02:04:37.415 --> 02:04:39.605
to ponder the pros and more pros

3222
02:04:39.605 --> 02:04:41.772
of Twitch or Twitch Prime.

3223
02:04:43.289 --> 02:04:46.522
Or to take hands and gift new subs to Critters

3224
02:04:46.522 --> 02:04:49.189
who find they can't afford them.

3225
02:04:50.432 --> 02:04:51.265
To play,

3226
02:04:54.333 --> 02:04:55.166
to sleep,

3227
02:04:57.116 --> 02:04:58.124
no more.

3228
02:04:59.504 --> 02:05:03.272
And by asleep to say the cast and crew of Crit'cal Role

3229
02:05:03.272 --> 02:05:05.840
might find their naps around the hectic schedule

3230
02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:07.352
of a live broadcast,

3231
02:05:07.352 --> 02:05:10.032
that we have brought for your consumption,

3232
02:05:10.032 --> 02:05:12.990
both Critter and fan alike.

3233
02:05:15.472 --> 02:05:16.305
To play,

3234
02:05:17.693 --> 02:05:18.526
or sleep.

3235
02:05:21.844 --> 02:05:22.677
No sleep,

3236
02:05:23.952 --> 02:05:25.535
but just to stream.

3237
02:05:27.451 --> 02:05:29.201
Aye, there's the rub.

3238
02:05:30.251 --> 02:05:35.235
For with your subscription, what streams may come.

3239
02:05:38.851 --> 02:05:41.472
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tag line.

3240
02:05:41.472 --> 02:05:43.261
Do we got that?

3241
02:05:43.261 --> 02:05:44.443
Oh!

3242
02:05:44.443 --> 02:05:47.099
That is Twitch poetry.

3243
02:05:47.099 --> 02:05:48.531
(grunts)

3244
02:05:48.531 --> 02:05:50.162
Oh, anyway.

3245
02:05:50.162 --> 02:05:52.521
Subscribe to Critical Role.

3246
02:05:52.521 --> 02:05:54.580
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe.

3247
02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:56.070
Gift some subscriptions.

3248
02:05:56.070 --> 02:05:58.270
You've got it.

3249
02:06:00.643 --> 02:06:01.991
Hmm.

3250
02:06:01.991 --> 02:06:05.211
Wrong soliloquy for the skull, but

3251
02:06:05.211 --> 02:06:06.730
that's fucking good.

3252
02:06:06.730 --> 02:06:09.563
(classical music)

3253
02:06:12.571 --> 02:06:17.571
(dramatic music)

3254
02:19:07.386 --> 02:19:08.338
MATT: Welcome back.

3255
02:19:08.338 --> 02:19:11.767
So before we jump into-- they're different movies.

3256
02:19:11.767 --> 02:19:14.178
We're debating Hereditary versus Midsommar.

3257
02:19:14.178 --> 02:19:15.617
Anyway.

3258
02:19:15.617 --> 02:19:17.007
Welcome back.

3259
02:19:17.007 --> 02:19:19.717
We have our winner of our fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway!

3260
02:19:19.717 --> 02:19:24.128
Congratulations to McComicker.

3261
02:19:24.128 --> 02:19:26.085
McComicker, congratulations.

3262
02:19:26.085 --> 02:19:29.615
McComicker, we'll have this sent to you ASAP, well done.

3263
02:19:29.615 --> 02:19:31.725
All righty!

3264
02:19:31.725 --> 02:19:33.895
Give you that, done.

3265
02:19:33.895 --> 02:19:36.145
(laughter)

3266
02:19:37.244 --> 02:19:38.077
TRAVIS: Wow!

3267
02:19:38.077 --> 02:19:39.062
TALIESIN: That was almost terrible.

3268
02:19:39.062 --> 02:19:41.313
MATT: That was so on brand.

3269
02:19:41.313 --> 02:19:43.672
TRAVIS: Please slow it down and make it GIF-able.
MATT: That was so on brand.

3270
02:19:43.672 --> 02:19:45.332
TRAVIS: I need it immediately!

3271
02:19:45.332 --> 02:19:46.474
MARISHA: (laughs)

3272
02:19:46.474 --> 02:19:47.624
MATT: That was so on brand.

3273
02:19:47.624 --> 02:19:50.317
TRAVIS: That was the anti-Foster card throw.

3274
02:19:50.317 --> 02:19:52.261
TALIESIN: We had to cut the feed, come back next week

3275
02:19:52.261 --> 02:19:53.678
with an eye patch.

3276
02:19:54.773 --> 02:19:57.170
TRAVIS: First of all, are you okay?

3277
02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:58.003
MATT: I'm fine.

3278
02:19:58.003 --> 02:19:59.690
TRAVIS: No paper cut? Okay.

3279
02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:01.149
MATT: Not physically.

3280
02:20:01.149 --> 02:20:02.370
Emotionally?

3281
02:20:02.370 --> 02:20:03.828
Deeply.

3282
02:20:03.828 --> 02:20:06.797
I can always count on the universe to humble me.

3283
02:20:06.797 --> 02:20:09.061
Every waking moment of every day.

3284
02:20:09.061 --> 02:20:10.010
So.

3285
02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:11.999
TRAVIS: Mustache last week, or this week.

3286
02:20:11.999 --> 02:20:12.998
MATT: Yeah.

3287
02:20:14.088 --> 02:20:15.631
Last we left off,

3288
02:20:17.799 --> 02:20:21.574
you guys have all rushed into the center

3289
02:20:21.574 --> 02:20:24.740
of the deck-built, temporary teleportation circle

3290
02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:27.457
that Caleb had created on your ship.

3291
02:20:27.457 --> 02:20:30.356
As you step through, the warm sea air

3292
02:20:30.356 --> 02:20:32.441
and the sun coming down upon you,

3293
02:20:32.441 --> 02:20:37.298
is immediately replaced with the cold, shaded interior

3294
02:20:37.298 --> 02:20:42.298
of the basement of the Valley Archive of the Cobalt Soul.

3295
02:20:42.334 --> 02:20:44.254
There, waiting for you on the opposite side,

3296
02:20:44.254 --> 02:20:45.812
because you gave them some heads up,

3297
02:20:45.812 --> 02:20:50.812
there is a standard cleric of Ioun there,

3298
02:20:50.961 --> 02:20:54.401
flanked by Zeenoth, Archivist Zeenoth there,

3299
02:20:54.401 --> 02:20:57.822
still looking bandaged and recovering.

3300
02:20:57.822 --> 02:21:00.170
Far better than you last saw him,

3301
02:21:00.170 --> 02:21:03.170
but is still wrapped in,

3302
02:21:03.170 --> 02:21:04.692
leaning against the wall a bit.

3303
02:21:04.692 --> 02:21:07.121
But as you all arrive, (whooshing)

3304
02:21:07.121 --> 02:21:09.671
one after the next, he goes,

3305
02:21:09.671 --> 02:21:10.921
"Welcome, hello.

3306
02:21:12.904 --> 02:21:16.209
"So you've arrived, we've met you here.

3307
02:21:16.209 --> 02:21:18.876
"How can we be of service to you?"

3308
02:21:19.835 --> 02:21:21.464
MARISHA: Well, I guess we're just passing through

3309
02:21:21.464 --> 02:21:22.315
at the moment.

3310
02:21:22.315 --> 02:21:26.016
But we're going to go visit a newfound friend

3311
02:21:26.016 --> 02:21:27.584
at the Halls of Erudition.

3312
02:21:27.584 --> 02:21:30.112
MATT: "Of course, by all means.

3313
02:21:31.976 --> 02:21:35.393
"By the way, I do apologize for how things

3314
02:21:36.245 --> 02:21:38.069
"have progressed,

3315
02:21:38.069 --> 02:21:39.773
"with your previous visit here."

3316
02:21:39.773 --> 02:21:44.273
SAM: Yes, you should be the one to apologize, definitely.

3317
02:21:45.373 --> 02:21:49.558
MATT: "Dairon has returned, and notified us of

3318
02:21:49.558 --> 02:21:53.472
"what you've all managed to accomplish in recent months,

3319
02:21:53.472 --> 02:21:57.239
"and--" looks over to the other monk,

3320
02:21:57.239 --> 02:21:58.271
like, "Oh!"

3321
02:21:58.271 --> 02:21:59.880
And takes a small,

3322
02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:04.261
folded package of some kind

3323
02:22:04.261 --> 02:22:07.060
that's wrapped in twine, in a cross pattern

3324
02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:08.512
and steps forward and hands it to you.

3325
02:22:08.512 --> 02:22:12.095
Says, "These raiments of the Expositor

3326
02:22:12.095 --> 02:22:14.312
"are yours now."

3327
02:22:14.312 --> 02:22:17.979
MARISHA: Ah, yes, I was expecting these, thank you.

3328
02:22:22.783 --> 02:22:25.453
TRAVIS: (whispering) Act cool, act cool.

3329
02:22:25.453 --> 02:22:26.286
MATT: "Yes?"

3330
02:22:27.284 --> 02:22:28.663
MARISHA: I apologize.

3331
02:22:28.663 --> 02:22:31.041
ALL: Whoa!

3332
02:22:31.041 --> 02:22:35.674
(laughter)

3333
02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:41.102
MARISHA: Came through a bit in a hurry and very headstrong

3334
02:22:41.102 --> 02:22:42.744
the last time, and

3335
02:22:46.153 --> 02:22:49.504
could've probably explained the situation better.

3336
02:22:49.504 --> 02:22:51.037
MATT: "Well, I...

3337
02:22:52.478 --> 02:22:57.478
"appreciate your candor and accept it."

3338
02:22:57.712 --> 02:22:59.194
LIAM: That shockwave hit Tal'Dorei.

3339
02:22:59.194 --> 02:23:01.444
(laughter)

3340
02:23:03.853 --> 02:23:08.626
MATT: "So welcome to the formal ranks

3341
02:23:08.626 --> 02:23:10.184
"of the Cobalt Soul, I should say.

3342
02:23:10.184 --> 02:23:15.184
"It's been a privilege to watch you ascend as you have.

3343
02:23:15.373 --> 02:23:17.413
"I've notified Dairon of your arrival,

3344
02:23:17.413 --> 02:23:19.280
"and before you head off to the Hall

02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:21.361
"or wherever else you're going,

"I believe they would like a word with you,

02:23:23.609 --> 02:23:25.109
"if you don't mind."

3348
02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:27.681
LAURA: Just Beau?

3349
02:23:27.681 --> 02:23:29.503
MATT: "All of you, if you wish to be so."

3350
02:23:29.503 --> 02:23:31.310
TALIESIN: Even better.
LAURA: Or if you want to--

3351
02:23:31.310 --> 02:23:32.143
TALIESIN: It's up to you.

3352
02:23:32.143 --> 02:23:34.444
MARISHA: No, no.
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

3353
02:23:34.444 --> 02:23:37.885
MATT: "It's your prerogative, but they're upstairs.

3354
02:23:37.885 --> 02:23:39.462
"Come, come.

3355
02:23:39.462 --> 02:23:40.967
"I'll lead you up."

3356
02:23:40.967 --> 02:23:44.298
LAURA: So are we allowed to go to Port Damali now, too,

3357
02:23:44.298 --> 02:23:45.178
and Rexxentrum?

3358
02:23:45.178 --> 02:23:47.719
MATT: "All of that has been suspended and abolished.

3359
02:23:47.719 --> 02:23:50.218
"You have free rein of the Archives."

3360
02:23:50.218 --> 02:23:51.688
TRAVIS: As it should be.

3361
02:23:51.688 --> 02:23:52.788
MARISHA: Thank you, yes.

3362
02:23:52.788 --> 02:23:53.959
Thank you.

3363
02:23:53.959 --> 02:23:55.546
TALIESIN: Are you going to go apologize some more?

3364
02:23:55.546 --> 02:23:57.546
Because that was awesome.

3365
02:23:58.785 --> 02:24:00.306
MARISHA: Those are sparing.

3366
02:24:00.306 --> 02:24:01.213
TALIESIN: I understand.

3367
02:24:01.213 --> 02:24:03.114
MARISHA: Caduceus, you know.

3368
02:24:03.114 --> 02:24:03.947
TALIESIN: I apologize.

3369
02:24:03.947 --> 02:24:05.816
MARISHA: Pick and choose my apologies.

3370
02:24:05.816 --> 02:24:07.026
TALIESIN: I give mine freely.

3371
02:24:07.026 --> 02:24:08.359
LIAM: And I'm sorry,

3372
02:24:09.925 --> 02:24:12.882
Beauregard's and our access to the stacks

3373
02:24:12.882 --> 02:24:15.232
has been reestablished as well, correct?

3374
02:24:15.232 --> 02:24:16.362
MATT: "Yes.

3375
02:24:16.362 --> 02:24:18.784
"If there's any further research you would like to make,

3376
02:24:18.784 --> 02:24:20.352
"that is at your disposal."

02:24:20.352 --> 02:24:22.381
LIAM: <i>Wunderbar</i>.

3378
02:24:22.381 --> 02:24:25.438
MATT: "Well, it is within her disposal."

3379
02:24:25.438 --> 02:24:27.778
"She can accompany you."
MARISHA: You have to report to me first,

3380
02:24:27.778 --> 02:24:30.050
so, you know, make sure you go through

3381
02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:32.890
the proper chain of command, okay?

3382
02:24:32.890 --> 02:24:34.698
LIAM: I'm comfortable with that.

3383
02:24:34.698 --> 02:24:36.770
SAM: Have our unlimited drinking privileges

3384
02:24:36.770 --> 02:24:40.170
been restored as well around town?

3385
02:24:41.295 --> 02:24:45.085
MATT: "That-- no.

3386
02:24:45.085 --> 02:24:46.666
"That's not a thing."

3387
02:24:46.666 --> 02:24:48.376
SAM: See to it!

3388
02:24:48.376 --> 02:24:51.034
MATT: "I cannot; that is not within my prerogative."

3389
02:24:51.034 --> 02:24:52.234
MARISHA: (laughs)

3390
02:24:52.234 --> 02:24:54.225
MATT: "You would have to speak to the High-Richter,

3391
02:24:54.225 --> 02:24:58.089
"or really anybody who's involved with the actual

3392
02:24:58.089 --> 02:25:00.078
"goings on of the city.

02:25:00.078 --> 02:25:02.649
"I predominantly deal with the Archive itself.

"My apologies."

3395
02:25:04.315 --> 02:25:05.845
SAM: All right.

3396
02:25:05.845 --> 02:25:07.215
MATT: "Nott, correct?"

3397
02:25:07.215 --> 02:25:08.087
SAM: Yes.

3398
02:25:08.087 --> 02:25:09.428
MATT: "Right, all right, I'll remember that.

3399
02:25:09.428 --> 02:25:10.506
"Very good.

3400
02:25:10.506 --> 02:25:11.460
"This way.

"Follow me,"

3402
02:25:12.293 --> 02:25:14.468
and he leads you up the stairs.

3403
02:25:14.468 --> 02:25:15.570
TRAVIS: Hurt?

3404
02:25:15.570 --> 02:25:17.518
LAURA: Yeah, from before.
MARISHA: From the attack.

3405
02:25:17.518 --> 02:25:19.381
It's been a few weeks, I know,

3406
02:25:19.381 --> 02:25:20.378
that's what I was thinking.

3407
02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:21.461
TRAVIS: Shake it off.

3408
02:25:21.461 --> 02:25:22.776
MARISHA: Come on, man.

3409
02:25:22.776 --> 02:25:23.636
What's up?

3410
02:25:23.636 --> 02:25:25.136
TRAVIS: Kidding, kidding, I know it was a slaughter.

3411
02:25:25.136 --> 02:25:26.998
MARISHA: We'll ask him about it when we get upstairs.

3412
02:25:26.998 --> 02:25:29.067
MATT: He was nearly killed!

3413
02:25:29.067 --> 02:25:30.056
Torn apart.

3414
02:25:30.056 --> 02:25:31.218
MARISHA: When we go upstairs, maybe we can

3415
02:25:31.218 --> 02:25:32.555
help him out a little bit.

3416
02:25:32.555 --> 02:25:33.388
LAURA: Yeah, totally!

3417
02:25:33.388 --> 02:25:34.853
I'm willing to give him some healing,

3418
02:25:34.853 --> 02:25:37.028
but I'm just surprised that nobody else has by now.

3419
02:25:37.028 --> 02:25:37.999
MARISHA: I know, me too. I was like,

3420
02:25:37.999 --> 02:25:39.212
oh, I don't, you know--

3421
02:25:39.212 --> 02:25:40.631
TALIESIN: I think it was far enough that it's still

3422
02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:42.691
shaking off.

3423
02:25:42.691 --> 02:25:45.441
MATT: You guys, he's not bleeding through

3424
02:25:45.441 --> 02:25:46.841
or covered in bandages,

3425
02:25:46.841 --> 02:25:49.169
but he has, you know, he's still holding himself

3426
02:25:49.169 --> 02:25:50.087
in a sore way.

3427
02:25:50.087 --> 02:25:51.287
TRAVIS: Pokey, poke.

3428
02:25:51.287 --> 02:25:53.204
MATT: He's not an adventurer, he's not used to this type

3429
02:25:53.204 --> 02:25:54.857
of hard lifestyle that you guys

3430
02:25:54.857 --> 02:25:57.068
progressively throw yourselves into.

3431
02:25:57.068 --> 02:25:58.297
And banned.

3432
02:25:58.297 --> 02:26:00.547
(laughter)

3433
02:26:02.373 --> 02:26:04.864
MATT: As you're led back into
the main chamber of the Archive,

3434
02:26:04.864 --> 02:26:08.533
you step out into the familiar marbled halls,

3435
02:26:08.533 --> 02:26:10.783
the high libraries,

3436
02:26:11.675 --> 02:26:14.675
the shelves, swarming you from all sides

3437
02:26:14.675 --> 02:26:18.423
with the open windows and the somewhat

3438
02:26:18.423 --> 02:26:21.293
arching glass dome atop of you

3439
02:26:21.293 --> 02:26:24.696
that has all sorts of stained glass imagery

3440
02:26:24.696 --> 02:26:26.333
and symbols poured through,

3441
02:26:26.333 --> 02:26:29.123
along with clear sunlight that seems to break through.

3442
02:26:29.123 --> 02:26:33.134
It is a sunnier day than Zadash

3443
02:26:33.134 --> 02:26:35.717
was last time you came through.

3444
02:26:36.891 --> 02:26:38.843
There, as you're stepping into the main chamber,

3445
02:26:38.843 --> 02:26:42.134
heading towards the entrance and/or exit

3446
02:26:42.134 --> 02:26:45.083
of the Archive, their arms crossed

3447
02:26:45.083 --> 02:26:48.991
in the familiar raiments, you see Dairon,

3448
02:26:49.843 --> 02:26:52.302
not in the dark elf guise of which

3449
02:26:52.302 --> 02:26:55.099
you had been dealing with her for quite some time

3450
02:26:55.099 --> 02:26:58.682
in Xhorhas, but in her original elven form.

3451
02:27:01.453 --> 02:27:03.553
"So. Welcome."

3452
02:27:05.713 --> 02:27:07.643
MARISHA: Glad to see you made it back.

3453
02:27:07.643 --> 02:27:09.273
MATT: "Glad to see you did as well.

3454
02:27:09.273 --> 02:27:10.190
"All of you.

3455
02:27:11.563 --> 02:27:14.898
"It was a bit of a mess for me to untangle

3456
02:27:14.898 --> 02:27:16.963
"when I arrived, you were not joking

3457
02:27:16.963 --> 02:27:20.130
"when you said you had left a bit of a,

3458
02:27:21.563 --> 02:27:23.300
"how do you say--?"

3459
02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:24.133
TRAVIS: Stink?

3460
02:27:24.133 --> 02:27:26.233
MATT: "Stink works, yes."

3461
02:27:26.233 --> 02:27:27.913
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry.

3462
02:27:27.913 --> 02:27:29.746
MATT: "It's all right, just

3463
02:27:31.182 --> 02:27:33.822
"be a little more careful now that you have some--"

3464
02:27:33.822 --> 02:27:34.883
MARISHA: Yeah.

3465
02:27:34.883 --> 02:27:35.800
MATT: "You know.

3466
02:27:36.662 --> 02:27:39.037
"Authority around here.

3467
02:27:39.037 --> 02:27:40.787
"Others, younger ones,

02:27:41.690 --> 02:27:44.530
"and those who come in, like you once were,

3469
02:27:44.530 --> 02:27:47.109
"as recruits will be looking up to you.

3470
02:27:47.109 --> 02:27:50.609
"That is a responsibility you hold as well."

3471
02:27:52.919 --> 02:27:54.477
MARISHA: Um.

3472
02:27:55.981 --> 02:27:57.709
MATT: "I don't hold you as any major example,

3473
02:27:57.709 --> 02:27:59.798
"but just be aware, there will be other Beauregards

3474
02:27:59.798 --> 02:28:02.871
"that will come in here acting as you once did.

3475
02:28:02.871 --> 02:28:05.149
"And then you'll have to show them the ropes."

3476
02:28:05.149 --> 02:28:06.858
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

3477
02:28:06.858 --> 02:28:07.875
I hear you.

3478
02:28:07.875 --> 02:28:09.709
TRAVIS: No one will get more detentions than you,

3479
02:28:09.709 --> 02:28:11.595
you'll hold the record forever, it's okay.

3480
02:28:11.595 --> 02:28:12.567
MARISHA: You have no idea.

3481
02:28:12.567 --> 02:28:13.400
TRAVIS: Okay.

3482
02:28:15.292 --> 02:28:18.278
MATT: "So I've taken the information we last spoke about,

3483
02:28:18.278 --> 02:28:23.028
"and I have only told a few trusted individuals about this

"I am keeping it close to my chest for now,

3488
02:28:38.945 --> 02:28:43.736
"as currently the struggles seem to grow.

02:28:44.764 --> 02:28:46.724

"and figuring out what is the best course of action."

3500
02:29:15.836 --> 02:29:17.502
LAURA: (whispering) Do you want to tell?

3501
02:29:17.502 --> 02:29:20.419
Do you want to tell Dairon about--?

3502
02:29:21.678 --> 02:29:24.843
MATT: "I am thinking possibly of,

3503
02:29:24.843 --> 02:29:26.513
"if I can pull some strings by passing

02:29:35.083 --> 02:29:35.916
LAURA: Whoa!

3508
02:29:35.916 --> 02:29:37.996
MATT: "In his council to inform them of this Kryn plot

02:29:37.996 --> 02:29:38.967
"with the Beacon."

3510
02:29:38.967 --> 02:29:39.800
LAURA: Whoa!

3511
02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:42.585
MATT: "Internal corruption that we've been able to suss out

"it may take weeks."

3517
02:29:52.535 --> 02:29:54.042
TRAVIS: Have we shared what we know, possibly,

3518
02:29:54.042 --> 02:29:57.065
about King Dwendal and the audience he keeps?

3519
02:29:57.065 --> 02:29:58.648
MARISHA: I don't think so.
LAURA: Hey, Fjord?

3520
02:30:01.554 --> 02:30:04.935
Can you tell if we're being scryed on right now?

3521
02:30:04.935 --> 02:30:06.723
SAM: You mean like invisible thing or--

3522
02:30:06.723 --> 02:30:07.985
LAURA: Yeah, isn't that--

3523
02:30:07.985 --> 02:30:10.310
TRAVIS: You're right. I haven't looked in a while.

3524
02:30:10.310 --> 02:30:11.566
Dairon?

3525
02:30:11.566 --> 02:30:14.738
Please don't be alarmed. And I summon the broadsword.

3526
02:30:14.738 --> 02:30:16.466
MATT: (whooshing)

3527
02:30:16.466 --> 02:30:19.908
TRAVIS: And I will cast See Invisibility.

3528
02:30:19.908 --> 02:30:20.741
MATT: Okay.

3529
02:30:22.447 --> 02:30:23.780
You go ahead and

3530
02:30:25.607 --> 02:30:26.767
cast the spell,

3531
02:30:26.767 --> 02:30:28.506
your eyes focus,

3532
02:30:28.506 --> 02:30:31.087
you can see the interesting,

3533
02:30:31.087 --> 02:30:33.626
almost ultraviolet, extra spectrum of light

3534
02:30:33.626 --> 02:30:37.247
that overlays that which you grew up with

3535
02:30:37.247 --> 02:30:39.388
and become accustomed to.

3536
02:30:39.388 --> 02:30:41.508
Kind of filters through the chamber.

3537
02:30:41.508 --> 02:30:44.196
Make a perception check.

3538
02:30:44.196 --> 02:30:45.658
(die rolls)

3539
02:30:45.658 --> 02:30:46.491
TRAVIS: 15.

3540
02:30:46.491 --> 02:30:49.327
MATT: 15. You take a moment to scan.

3541
02:30:49.327 --> 02:30:50.916
Nothing seems to catch your eye.

3542
02:30:50.916 --> 02:30:52.666
TRAVIS: We seem to be fine.

3543
02:30:55.018 --> 02:30:57.098
MARISHA: Dairon, a lot has happened

3544
02:30:57.098 --> 02:31:00.767
since last we spoke.

3545
02:31:00.767 --> 02:31:03.396
We've gained a lot of new information.

3546
02:31:03.396 --> 02:31:05.138
MATT: "Please tell me."

3547
02:31:05.138 --> 02:31:08.636
MARISHA: It seems a lot of our leads towards the devices

3548
02:31:08.636 --> 02:31:11.834
that were opening portals towards the Abyss--

3549
02:31:11.834 --> 02:31:12.667
MATT: "Right."

3550
02:31:12.667 --> 02:31:16.108
MARISHA: Everything leaning towards the Chained Oblivion

3551
02:31:16.108 --> 02:31:18.607
and the Angel of Irons

3552
02:31:18.607 --> 02:31:22.756
is starting to culminate and come into focus.

3553
02:31:22.756 --> 02:31:23.839
I don't know.

3554
02:31:26.098 --> 02:31:28.515
I think it's still to be said

3555
02:31:29.748 --> 02:31:32.658
King Dwendal's knowledge or involvement

3556
02:31:32.658 --> 02:31:34.741
in this entire situation.

3557
02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:37.170
But it seems

3558
02:31:39.090 --> 02:31:42.156
a plot for some sort of

3559
02:31:42.156 --> 02:31:45.297
new rise of Tharizdun,

3560
02:31:47.050 --> 02:31:49.159
he's imminent.

3561
02:31:50.170 --> 02:31:52.503
LAURA: There's no Angel of Irons!

3562
02:31:53.428 --> 02:31:54.845
MARISHA: He was a guise.

3563
02:31:56.017 --> 02:31:58.111
SAM: And we know that someone in King Dwendal's

3564
02:31:58.111 --> 02:32:02.277
immediate vicinity is part of that plot.

3565
02:32:02.277 --> 02:32:04.977
MATT: "King Dwendal? Who is this?"

3566
02:32:04.977 --> 02:32:08.833
MARISHA: His name is Vence.

3567
02:32:08.833 --> 02:32:10.524
Nuthaleus.

3568
02:32:11.852 --> 02:32:15.492
He's an Annex to Ludinus.

3569
02:32:15.492 --> 02:32:17.353
MATT: "I know of him, but he is,

3570
02:32:17.353 --> 02:32:19.652
"he's not of the Council directly--"

3571
02:32:19.652 --> 02:32:22.382
MARISHA: You're right, he is, yeah.

3572
02:32:22.382 --> 02:32:26.764
MATT: "He is the associate, assistant, if you were to

3573
02:32:26.764 --> 02:32:28.577
"Ludinus Da'leth, the Martinet."

3574
02:32:28.577 --> 02:32:32.318
MARISHA: We know that, through scrying means

3575
02:32:32.318 --> 02:32:35.976
with Jester's talents, that

3576
02:32:36.889 --> 02:32:40.878
he's had some sort of association with King Dwendal.

3577
02:32:40.878 --> 02:32:45.809
I mean, it mainly seems like some sort of war front approach

3578
02:32:45.809 --> 02:32:49.117
with sending the mages out,

3579
02:32:50.449 --> 02:32:53.918
but we scryed on him and they were--

3580
02:32:53.918 --> 02:32:57.049
TALIESIN: It seems that there's a third party that is

3581
02:32:57.049 --> 02:33:00.736
pushing both sides towards each other.

3582
02:33:00.736 --> 02:33:03.838
MATT: "Where is he now, do you know?"

3583
02:33:03.838 --> 02:33:04.895
MARISHA: Vence?

3584
02:33:04.895 --> 02:33:05.897
No.

3585
02:33:05.897 --> 02:33:06.730
SAM: Maybe.

3586
02:33:07.927 --> 02:33:09.236
Do you want to scry on Blondie?

3587
02:33:09.236 --> 02:33:11.068
Should we, should we?

3588
02:33:11.068 --> 02:33:12.388
LAURA: Want me to?

3589
02:33:12.388 --> 02:33:14.758
TALIESIN: We've got another--

3590
02:33:14.758 --> 02:33:16.231
SAM: Sorry, we have some old fish and chips

3591
02:33:16.231 --> 02:33:17.168
that we've been eating.

3592
02:33:17.168 --> 02:33:18.467
LAURA: Just some chips.

3593
02:33:18.467 --> 02:33:19.508
TALIESIN: They're just so crunchy now.

3594
02:33:19.508 --> 02:33:20.977
TRAVIS: It might be pertinent to what we--

3595
02:33:20.977 --> 02:33:23.906
TALIESIN: Do we do it now or--? We have another meeting.

3596
02:33:23.906 --> 02:33:25.532
Do we, when do we--

3597
02:33:26.438 --> 02:33:29.518
Well, I suppose we have more than one scrying spell.

3598
02:33:29.518 --> 02:33:30.889
Well, if you scry on someone once,

3599
02:33:30.889 --> 02:33:33.118
when can you do it again?

3600
02:33:33.118 --> 02:33:36.670
SAM: I mean, if we need to know where he is, let's find out.

3601
02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:38.920
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's try it.

3602
02:33:40.211 --> 02:33:42.577
LAURA: Let me make sure that I've prepared it.

3603
02:33:42.577 --> 02:33:44.718
TALIESIN: (whispers) Oh man.

3604
02:33:44.718 --> 02:33:45.551
LAURA: I didn't.

3605
02:33:45.551 --> 02:33:47.513
SAM: Crunchy table tonight.

3606
02:33:47.513 --> 02:33:49.094
LAURA: I didn't prepare scrying today.

3607
02:33:49.094 --> 02:33:50.705
SAM: What?! (laughs)

3608
02:33:50.705 --> 02:33:53.894
You use it literally every day!

3609
02:33:53.894 --> 02:33:57.003
LAURA: Well, not on days I don't prepare it.

3610
02:33:57.003 --> 02:33:59.623
TRAVIS: What did you prepare today?

3611
02:33:59.623 --> 02:34:02.968
SAM: It's all healing spells, what?!

3612
02:34:02.968 --> 02:34:05.493
LAURA: Wait a minute.
TALIESIN: Purify Food and Drink.

3613
02:34:05.493 --> 02:34:06.534
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

3614
02:34:06.534 --> 02:34:08.985
MATT: As a note, if a creature succeeds a saving throw,

3615
02:34:08.985 --> 02:34:10.785
it cannot be scryed on for 24 hours.

3616
02:34:10.785 --> 02:34:13.516
If it fails a saving throw, you can keep scrying

3617
02:34:13.516 --> 02:34:16.212
until they succeeds essentially.

3618
02:34:16.212 --> 02:34:17.804
TRAVIS: Did you prepare it?

3619
02:34:17.804 --> 02:34:19.404
LAURA: No.

3620
02:34:19.404 --> 02:34:21.609
No, I prepared Insect Plague.

3621
02:34:21.609 --> 02:34:24.336
(laughter)

3622
02:34:24.336 --> 02:34:25.169
TALIESIN: I knew it.

3623
02:34:25.169 --> 02:34:27.890
LAURA: And Modify-- I have Modify Memory.

3624
02:34:27.890 --> 02:34:30.007
TRAVIS: Unleash your abilities!

3625
02:34:30.007 --> 02:34:30.840
LIAM: Not the bees!

3626
02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:32.753
TRAVIS: Show them what you've got!

3627
02:34:32.753 --> 02:34:34.632
LAURA: And Commune, I have Commune.

3628
02:34:34.632 --> 02:34:35.932
TALIESIN: Ah, Commune.

3629
02:34:35.932 --> 02:34:37.684
LAURA: That's a good one to have today.

3630
02:34:37.684 --> 02:34:40.532
LIAM: Perhaps we could complete our current business

3631
02:34:40.532 --> 02:34:42.164
here in Zadash and tomorrow--

3632
02:34:42.164 --> 02:34:43.497
SAM: Sure!
LIAM: -- you'll be better prepared.

3633
02:34:43.497 --> 02:34:45.295
LAURA: I could, you know, I could just ask the Traveler

3634
02:34:45.295 --> 02:34:48.273
if he knows where exactly.

3635
02:34:48.273 --> 02:34:50.804
SAM: It's not an immediate pressing concern, I suppose,

3636
02:34:50.804 --> 02:34:52.742
let's just go talk to our person.

3637
02:34:52.742 --> 02:34:53.889
LAURA: Mmkay.

3638
02:34:53.889 --> 02:34:55.742
MATT: "Well, if what you're saying is true

3639
02:34:55.742 --> 02:34:59.713
"and this is somehow tied in with Tharizdun,

3640
02:34:59.713 --> 02:35:00.822
"that is definitely worrying,

3641
02:35:00.822 --> 02:35:04.273
"but we need more concrete evidence of this, though.

3642
02:35:04.273 --> 02:35:07.773
"Word is not enough to take it to the King."

3643
02:35:09.065 --> 02:35:11.785
SAM: Well, we'll find some evidence, then.

3644
02:35:11.785 --> 02:35:15.001
LAURA: Allura Vysoren is letting

3645
02:35:15.001 --> 02:35:17.185
Tal'Dorei know about it.

3646
02:35:17.185 --> 02:35:18.456
She was there when we found out.

3647
02:35:18.456 --> 02:35:20.356
MATT: "This goes as far as Tal'Dorei?"

3648
02:35:20.356 --> 02:35:23.454
LAURA: Well, yeah, she's on the Council or something.

3649
02:35:23.454 --> 02:35:24.594
SAM: Do you happen to know any other members of

3650
02:35:24.594 --> 02:35:26.637
the Council of Tal'Dorei, by the way?

3651
02:35:26.637 --> 02:35:28.604
MATT: "I have not traveled there, unfortunately."

3652
02:35:28.604 --> 02:35:29.564
TRAVIS: It's unfortunate.

3653
02:35:29.564 --> 02:35:31.654
LAURA: Maybe King Dwendal will know.

3654
02:35:31.654 --> 02:35:34.225
SAM: In your meeting with King Dwendal, could you ask him?

3655
02:35:34.225 --> 02:35:35.644
(laughter)

3656
02:35:35.644 --> 02:35:37.094
MATT: "If it is pertinent, maybe."

3657
02:35:37.094 --> 02:35:37.927
SAM: Okay.

3658
02:35:37.927 --> 02:35:40.016
LIAM: Just everyone we see for an hour.

3659
02:35:40.016 --> 02:35:41.227
(laughter)

3660
02:35:41.227 --> 02:35:42.060
LAURA: So far we know two.

3661
02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:43.656
TALIESIN: Who do you know?

3662
02:35:43.656 --> 02:35:46.416
TRAVIS: It seems this plot, in all of its connections,

3663
02:35:46.416 --> 02:35:50.521
span outside the continent of just our own.

3664
02:35:50.521 --> 02:35:54.783
It's quite larger than we're able to fathom, actually.

3665
02:35:54.783 --> 02:35:58.391
MARISHA: And with each hole,

3666
02:35:58.391 --> 02:36:00.791
with each opening and,

3667
02:36:00.791 --> 02:36:03.954
from this realm to the Abyss,

3668
02:36:03.954 --> 02:36:08.051
the realms get weaker and closer together.

3669
02:36:08.051 --> 02:36:10.703
The divide between them.

3670
02:36:10.703 --> 02:36:12.791
LAURA: It's like termite damage, you know?

3671
02:36:12.791 --> 02:36:14.562
And then eventually a house will fall.

3672
02:36:14.562 --> 02:36:15.663
MARISHA: Yep.

3673
02:36:15.663 --> 02:36:17.114
If you crack the foundation,

3674
02:36:17.114 --> 02:36:20.902
(snaps fingers) bad news.

3675
02:36:20.902 --> 02:36:21.902
MATT: "Hmm, well,

3676
02:36:22.754 --> 02:36:25.682
"if there's anything you wish to look up or research here,

3677
02:36:25.682 --> 02:36:27.922
"the Archive is at your disposal,

3678
02:36:27.922 --> 02:36:30.823
"otherwise gather your, whatever allies you have,

3679
02:36:30.823 --> 02:36:32.863
"and try and get what information you can

3680
02:36:32.863 --> 02:36:34.823
"before we move forward.

3681
02:36:34.823 --> 02:36:38.652
"I will see if I can

3682
02:36:38.652 --> 02:36:41.074
"muster some sort of an audience,

3683
02:36:41.074 --> 02:36:45.119
"but I do not know how long it will take."

3684
02:36:45.119 --> 02:36:47.922
SAM: Where are you staying, where do you stay here?

3685
02:36:47.922 --> 02:36:48.755
MATT: "Here."

3686
02:36:48.755 --> 02:36:49.588
SAM: Oh.

3687
02:36:49.588 --> 02:36:52.311
MATT: "You have a chamber here now as well."

3688
02:36:52.311 --> 02:36:54.170
MARISHA: Wait, I'm not in a bunk,

3689
02:36:54.170 --> 02:36:56.518
like, shoved in the corner of a wall anymore?

3690
02:36:56.518 --> 02:36:58.069
MATT: "You're an Expositor, you have your own ways here."

3691
02:36:58.069 --> 02:36:59.816
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

3692
02:36:59.816 --> 02:37:01.180
They give you furniture, too?

3693
02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:02.368
MARISHA: What do I got, what do I got?

3694
02:37:02.368 --> 02:37:03.396
Show me, show me my room.

3695
02:37:03.396 --> 02:37:04.519
SAM: Is it en suite bathroom?

3696
02:37:04.519 --> 02:37:06.546
MARISHA: No, it's a monastery.

3697
02:37:06.546 --> 02:37:07.584
TALIESIN: You had a monk bunk.

3698
02:37:07.584 --> 02:37:09.834
(laughter)

3699
02:37:11.256 --> 02:37:12.923
MATT: "I am not to show you this,

3700
02:37:12.923 --> 02:37:15.306
"Zeenoth can take you on the journey."

3701
02:37:15.306 --> 02:37:17.689
MARISHA: Are you all right, by the way?

3702
02:37:17.689 --> 02:37:19.932
MATT: "I'm all right. I'm--

3703
02:37:19.932 --> 02:37:24.182
"I'm thankful to have made it back in one piece, and

3704
02:37:25.713 --> 02:37:29.929
"strangely consolidating my

3705
02:37:29.929 --> 02:37:32.993
prejudice against the Kryn."

3706
02:37:32.993 --> 02:37:34.814
MARISHA: Yeah, you came in real hot,

3707
02:37:34.814 --> 02:37:36.924
like, that first night that we talked about it.

3708
02:37:36.924 --> 02:37:39.032
I was actually planning on eventually

3709
02:37:39.032 --> 02:37:40.802
talking to you about it, if it didn't improve,

3710
02:37:40.802 --> 02:37:42.603
but you kind of, you know, you started come around

3711
02:37:42.603 --> 02:37:43.603
on your own.

3712
02:37:44.622 --> 02:37:46.712
MATT: "More or less, yes.

3713
02:37:46.712 --> 02:37:47.782
"This world is complicated,

3714
02:37:47.782 --> 02:37:51.474
"and it's easy to be blinded by hate and vengeance.

3715
02:37:53.178 --> 02:37:57.240
"But everything is as we are told, I suppose.

3716
02:37:57.240 --> 02:37:58.073
"So.

3717
02:37:59.131 --> 02:38:01.903
"I apologize if I made you uncomfortable."

3718
02:38:01.903 --> 02:38:02.736
MARISHA: Nah.

3719
02:38:03.696 --> 02:38:05.447
It's hard to make me uncomfortable.

3720
02:38:05.447 --> 02:38:07.078
Real hard.

3721
02:38:07.078 --> 02:38:08.547
MATT: "It's true.

3722
02:38:08.547 --> 02:38:10.013
"And they do it enough for you, anyway."

3723
02:38:10.013 --> 02:38:12.046
TRAVIS: (fart sound) Beau!

3724
02:38:12.046 --> 02:38:12.879
Terrible!

3725
02:38:12.879 --> 02:38:15.736
MARISHA: Heh.
TRAVIS: You're an Expositor now.

3726
02:38:15.736 --> 02:38:17.746
MATT: "I have to go."

3727
02:38:17.746 --> 02:38:19.496
TRAVIS: Oh, just walk away.

3728
02:38:20.496 --> 02:38:21.928
MATT: "On that note, I'm going to go ahead

3729
02:38:21.928 --> 02:38:25.496
"and see what connections I cane make towards the crown.

3730
02:38:25.496 --> 02:38:26.656
"Good luck."

3731
02:38:26.656 --> 02:38:29.388
SAM and LAURA: Thank you!

3732
02:38:29.388 --> 02:38:32.206
MATT: Dairon exits the Archive.

3733
02:38:32.206 --> 02:38:33.395
Zeenoth leads you to your chamber,

3734
02:38:33.395 --> 02:38:34.805
which is actually up on,

3735
02:38:34.805 --> 02:38:36.955
there's a series of spiral staircases

3736
02:38:36.955 --> 02:38:38.006
leading to different levels

3737
02:38:38.006 --> 02:38:40.187
within the main chamber of the Archive.

3738
02:38:40.187 --> 02:38:42.347
There is the third floor that goes to the back,

3739
02:38:42.347 --> 02:38:44.155
and which you do know, you've walked around there before,

3740
02:38:44.155 --> 02:38:45.645
but there was this large loop,

3741
02:38:45.645 --> 02:38:48.066
it's like a long semi-circle hallway

3742
02:38:48.066 --> 02:38:49.906
that bends around the back

3743
02:38:49.906 --> 02:38:52.176
about two and a half, three stories up.

3744
02:38:52.176 --> 02:38:54.846
In there, there are multiple, multiple chambers in there

3745
02:38:54.846 --> 02:38:58.654
where a lot of the higher-up members of the Archive exist.

3746
02:38:58.654 --> 02:39:02.856
You are given a room that has a very nice bed,

3747
02:39:02.856 --> 02:39:05.326
it's maybe, I'd say,

3748
02:39:05.326 --> 02:39:07.907
1,000 square feet for a singular chamber.

3749
02:39:07.907 --> 02:39:09.074
SAM: The bed!

3750
02:39:09.986 --> 02:39:10.819
MATT: Window,

3751
02:39:11.854 --> 02:39:13.187
it's a very, very nice chamber,

3752
02:39:13.187 --> 02:39:15.715
much better than the shitty bunk that you had known

3753
02:39:15.715 --> 02:39:17.993
and trained in.

3754
02:39:17.993 --> 02:39:19.998
MARISHA: I'm international, bitches!

3755
02:39:19.998 --> 02:39:21.266
SAM: Can we all sleep here?

3756
02:39:21.266 --> 02:39:23.386
LAURA: I go jump on the bed.

3757
02:39:23.386 --> 02:39:26.633
MATT: You all could sleep here, but there is only one bed.

3758
02:39:26.633 --> 02:39:28.049
There is a chamber at your disposal.

3759
02:39:28.049 --> 02:39:28.990
So you do not have to pay

3760
02:39:28.990 --> 02:39:31.874
for a place to crash, if you'd like.

3761
02:39:33.536 --> 02:39:34.369
So.

3762
02:39:34.369 --> 02:39:35.806
The furniture is minimal, it looks like

3763
02:39:35.806 --> 02:39:37.354
they haven't finished furnishing it yet.

3764
02:39:37.354 --> 02:39:39.736
You had only just recently been given your position

3765
02:39:39.736 --> 02:39:42.834
and these things, so it's a relatively bland chamber.

3766
02:39:42.834 --> 02:39:45.387
You don't know if more furniture or furnishing is coming,

3767
02:39:45.387 --> 02:39:47.045
or if they're expecting you to helm that,

3768
02:39:47.045 --> 02:39:49.224
but it, the chamber is--

3769
02:39:49.224 --> 02:39:50.755
MARISHA: Maybe we can go shopping.

3770
02:39:50.755 --> 02:39:52.164
Get a Murphy bed or something.

3771
02:39:52.164 --> 02:39:53.323
LAURA: Ooh, that'd be cool!

3772
02:39:53.323 --> 02:39:56.022
Then you could turn this into a living room, and then--

3773
02:39:56.022 --> 02:39:57.934
MARISHA: Into a pull-out situation.

3774
02:39:57.934 --> 02:39:59.984
LAURA: Yeah. Beau, you never told us what a big deal

3775
02:39:59.984 --> 02:40:01.774
being an Expositor is!

3776
02:40:01.774 --> 02:40:03.747
(laughter)

3777
02:40:03.747 --> 02:40:04.580
I'm jumping.

3778
02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:08.251
MARISHA: I noticed! (laughs)

3779
02:40:08.251 --> 02:40:10.422
I guess I--

3780
02:40:10.422 --> 02:40:13.672
TRAVIS: That's the most Ronin jump.

3781
02:40:13.672 --> 02:40:15.143
(laughter)

3782
02:40:15.143 --> 02:40:17.784
MARISHA: I don't know, I guess I didn't honestly know.

3783
02:40:17.784 --> 02:40:19.552
LAURA: What does your new outfit look like?

3784
02:40:19.552 --> 02:40:20.574
MARISHA: (gasps)

3785
02:40:20.574 --> 02:40:21.741
I pull it out.

3786
02:40:23.443 --> 02:40:27.312
MATT: Similar to the previous raiments that you've worn,

3787
02:40:27.312 --> 02:40:29.773
but they are far more detailed.

3788
02:40:29.773 --> 02:40:33.534
The elements in the front, it has almost

3789
02:40:33.534 --> 02:40:36.803
a more formal and brocade version

3790
02:40:36.803 --> 02:40:38.302
of a Sub-Zero type outfit,

3791
02:40:38.302 --> 02:40:41.022
has the V that comes up over the shoulders,

3792
02:40:41.022 --> 02:40:44.855
but it curls over with this beautiful,

3793
02:40:46.662 --> 02:40:47.691
the word escapes me.

3794
02:40:47.691 --> 02:40:49.022
LIAM: Massive shoulder pads.

3795
02:40:49.022 --> 02:40:50.249
MATT: Yeah, the trim on the side.

3796
02:40:50.249 --> 02:40:51.912
TRAVIS: Cuff that like--

3797
02:40:51.912 --> 02:40:53.662
MATT: Yeah, it curls off the side there.

3798
02:40:53.662 --> 02:40:55.531
It's just, that goes over whatever else you're wearing.

3799
02:40:55.531 --> 02:40:57.238
It's just a symbol of your status,

3800
02:40:57.238 --> 02:40:59.796
not an entire outfit.
LAURA: It covers up your abs, though?

3801
02:40:59.796 --> 02:41:01.003
MARISHA: I slip it on.

3802
02:41:01.003 --> 02:41:02.778
MATT: Okay. It actually comes pretty low,

3803
02:41:02.778 --> 02:41:04.018
and you can actually, the abs in the bottom--

3804
02:41:04.018 --> 02:41:07.042
LAURA: Tight, tight, tight.

3805
02:41:07.042 --> 02:41:08.607
TALIESIN: Librarian abs.

3806
02:41:08.607 --> 02:41:10.184
MATT: It's not too bulky, and it fits over the outfit

3807
02:41:10.184 --> 02:41:11.264
you currently have.

3808
02:41:11.264 --> 02:41:13.347
MARISHA: Take off my blue belts.

3809
02:41:15.454 --> 02:41:16.287
MATT: Mmkay.

3810
02:41:17.365 --> 02:41:18.270
SAM: Your pants fall off.

3811
02:41:18.270 --> 02:41:19.305
(laughter)

3812
02:41:19.305 --> 02:41:20.138
MARISHA: No!

3813
02:41:21.904 --> 02:41:24.572
LAURA: They're very tight pants.

3814
02:41:24.572 --> 02:41:26.592
MARISHA: Should I keep this?

3815
02:41:26.592 --> 02:41:27.675
This was, like, the--

3816
02:41:29.361 --> 02:41:32.232
this was like the starter colors of the uniform.

3817
02:41:32.232 --> 02:41:34.152
LIAM: Yes, you should keep it.

3818
02:41:34.152 --> 02:41:35.462
LAURA: Yeah, it's important!

3819
02:41:35.462 --> 02:41:37.203
LIAM: It's important to know where you came from.

3820
02:41:37.203 --> 02:41:41.786
TRAVIS: Maybe you'll hand it off to someone else one day.

3821
02:41:42.683 --> 02:41:45.334
TALIESIN: So they can keep their pants up.

3822
02:41:45.334 --> 02:41:46.167
MARISHA: Yeah.

3823
02:41:48.014 --> 02:41:50.243
Belts are important.

3824
02:41:50.243 --> 02:41:53.499
TRAVIS: For god's sake, pick your pants up off the floor.

3825
02:41:53.499 --> 02:41:54.814
TALIESIN: Really uncomfortable.

3826
02:41:54.814 --> 02:41:56.502
(laughter)

3827
02:41:56.502 --> 02:41:59.134
SAM: You should tie a knot in that belt, though.

3828
02:41:59.134 --> 02:42:00.941
Because you're done with it.

3829
02:42:00.941 --> 02:42:03.043
It's what they do in karate, anyway.

3830
02:42:03.043 --> 02:42:03.876
MARISHA: Is that what they do?

3831
02:42:03.876 --> 02:42:04.709
SAM and TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

3832
02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:07.494
SAM: Karate.

3833
02:42:07.494 --> 02:42:10.574
MARISHA: And I drape it over my bedpost.

3834
02:42:10.574 --> 02:42:12.780
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

3835
02:42:12.780 --> 02:42:15.494
MARISHA: And take out the, it's like a gray, right?

3836
02:42:15.494 --> 02:42:17.702
It's like a gray belt?

3837
02:42:17.702 --> 02:42:20.150
Wrap it around.
SAM: When do you get a black belt?

3838
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:21.403
MARISHA: Well, I mean.

3839
02:42:21.403 --> 02:42:22.294
MATT: It doesn't work like that.

3840
02:42:22.294 --> 02:42:24.219
(laughter)

3841
02:42:24.219 --> 02:42:25.635
SAM: That's it? There's no black belt?

3842
02:42:25.635 --> 02:42:27.502
TRAVIS: High-Richter, here we come.

3843
02:42:27.502 --> 02:42:28.531
MARISHA: It's like--

3844
02:42:28.531 --> 02:42:30.242
TRAVIS: One step at a time.

3845
02:42:30.242 --> 02:42:31.380
Talking over.

3846
02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:34.020
MARISHA: No, it's more of an identifier of what your role is

3847
02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:37.452
in the monastery. So the Librarians have a different color,

3848
02:42:37.452 --> 02:42:39.292
and the Expositors have a different color,

3849
02:42:39.292 --> 02:42:42.097
but the, you know.

3850
02:42:42.097 --> 02:42:43.150
SAM: Cool.

3851
02:42:43.150 --> 02:42:44.540
MARISHA: Oh yeah, sorry.

3852
02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:47.762
TRAVIS: So Expositor, where are we off to next?

3853
02:42:47.762 --> 02:42:48.595
MARISHA: Hmm.

3854
02:42:49.431 --> 02:42:51.482
To the Halls of Erudition?

3855
02:42:51.482 --> 02:42:52.820
TRAVIS: Seems that way.

3856
02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:54.652
MARISHA: Do we need to do any more research before we leave?

3857
02:42:54.652 --> 02:42:56.852
TRAVIS: I have a quick question for Caleb, actually,

3858
02:42:56.852 --> 02:42:58.470
if you don't mind.

3859
02:42:58.470 --> 02:43:00.802
Just because we are in your old territory,

3860
02:43:00.802 --> 02:43:02.322
your old hood,

3861
02:43:02.322 --> 02:43:04.602
if we should be so unfortunate as to come across

3862
02:43:04.602 --> 02:43:09.140
any of those Trent Ikithon types,

3863
02:43:09.140 --> 02:43:12.732
are there any identifying features, clothing, garb,

3864
02:43:12.732 --> 02:43:14.031
things that we should watch out for,

3865
02:43:14.031 --> 02:43:15.351
things that you might be able to know

3866
02:43:15.351 --> 02:43:19.851
are them in a low-key, or hiding, or stealth position?

3867
02:43:20.751 --> 02:43:21.584
LIAM: Well.

3868
02:43:23.067 --> 02:43:27.802
When I was training, we wore very, very simple,

3869
02:43:27.802 --> 02:43:30.293
poor garb.

3870
02:43:32.802 --> 02:43:35.652
But I don't think that would be the case now.

3871
02:43:35.652 --> 02:43:38.735
You could try to keep an eye on maybe

3872
02:43:39.642 --> 02:43:41.218
their arms if they're exposed,

3873
02:43:41.218 --> 02:43:44.951
and if you see anything similar to this,

3874
02:43:46.122 --> 02:43:48.140
I can't think elsewise.

3875
02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:51.212
I don't think that I should go with you.

3876
02:43:51.212 --> 02:43:52.892
TRAVIS: At all?

3877
02:43:52.892 --> 02:43:53.725
MARISHA: Really?

3878
02:43:56.940 --> 02:44:00.572
LIAM: I did not study here, I studied in Rexxentrum,

3879
02:44:00.572 --> 02:44:05.119
which is where I'm from, outside of Rexxentrum.

3880
02:44:05.119 --> 02:44:08.619
But the Assembly are a tightly knit group,

3881
02:44:10.951 --> 02:44:14.651
and despite Yussa's

3882
02:44:14.651 --> 02:44:17.639
fondness for this gentleman,

3883
02:44:17.639 --> 02:44:22.639
I have no assurances of his allegiance to the rest.

3884
02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:24.821
LAURA: And you think they would see through

3885
02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:27.191
a magical disguise or something?

3886
02:44:27.191 --> 02:44:28.024
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

3887
02:44:29.191 --> 02:44:32.941
LAURA: Well, what if we used a practical disguise?

3888
02:44:34.471 --> 02:44:35.304
TALIESIN: Or, and--

3889
02:44:37.392 --> 02:44:41.783
obviously we will honor whatever your decision is,

3890
02:44:41.783 --> 02:44:43.533
it might be useful to

3891
02:44:44.443 --> 02:44:47.137
gauge his reaction to you,

3892
02:44:47.137 --> 02:44:48.804
if that makes sense.

3893
02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:51.980
I know that's a risk.

3894
02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:53.559
But we'll learn a lot

3895
02:44:53.559 --> 02:44:55.809
by having you in that room.

3896
02:44:59.226 --> 02:45:00.668
But either way,

3897
02:45:03.362 --> 02:45:05.280
either thought has merit.

3898
02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:08.780
MARISHA: Caduceus does have an interesting point.

3899
02:45:10.231 --> 02:45:12.311
LIAM: What if he does not react,

3900
02:45:12.311 --> 02:45:15.228
and keeps his true feelings hidden?

3901
02:45:16.610 --> 02:45:19.249
TALIESIN: Well, then we were already in trouble.

3902
02:45:19.249 --> 02:45:21.130
TRAVIS: And we would be without one

3903
02:45:21.130 --> 02:45:23.490
very powerful member of the group.

3904
02:45:23.490 --> 02:45:24.323
LAURA: Yeah.

3905
02:45:24.323 --> 02:45:25.940
TRAVIS: It would be a clear disadvantage.

3906
02:45:25.940 --> 02:45:28.551
LAURA: Caduceus is really good at reading people.

3907
02:45:28.551 --> 02:45:29.850
TALIESIN: Pretty good.

3908
02:45:29.850 --> 02:45:33.042
MARISHA: And you're really good
at talking to these mage types.

3909
02:45:33.042 --> 02:45:36.111
LAURA: Can you talk without an accent?

3910
02:45:36.111 --> 02:45:38.061
You know, like a normal voice, like mine or something?

3911
02:45:38.061 --> 02:45:40.489
SAM: Yeah, a <i>normal</i> voice.

3912
02:45:42.730 --> 02:45:43.791
LIAM: What do you mean?

3913
02:45:43.791 --> 02:45:46.330
I speak in a normal voice.

3914
02:45:46.330 --> 02:45:50.271
SAM: No, but not the weird way that you talk,

3915
02:45:50.271 --> 02:45:51.104
the normal way.

3916
02:45:51.104 --> 02:45:53.908
LIAM: Who do you want me to talk like?

3917
02:45:53.908 --> 02:45:54.741
SAM: Normal?

3918
02:45:56.185 --> 02:45:57.911
LAURA: You know, like Nott or like me,

3919
02:45:57.911 --> 02:45:59.660
something very normal.

3920
02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:03.860
SAM: (stilted) Someone from Nicodranas.

3921
02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:07.271
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah! Fjord, he could do your accent

3922
02:46:07.271 --> 02:46:08.938
that you used to do!

3923
02:46:09.959 --> 02:46:12.282
LIAM: (stilted) Why would I do that, though?

3924
02:46:12.282 --> 02:46:15.092
LAURA: So that they won't know it's you.

3925
02:46:15.092 --> 02:46:18.103
LIAM: (stilted) I just don't feel as smooth--

3926
02:46:18.103 --> 02:46:20.324
MARISHA: Jester, this is, do you see what now--

3927
02:46:20.324 --> 02:46:21.284
TRAVIS: Way more obvious.

3928
02:46:21.284 --> 02:46:22.124
MARISHA: This is awful.

3929
02:46:22.124 --> 02:46:23.957
TRAVIS: Big problems.
MARISHA: This is bad.

3930
02:46:23.957 --> 02:46:27.831
TALIESIN: Wait, wait, I want to hear, do Fjord's old accent.

3931
02:46:27.831 --> 02:46:29.543
LIAM: Oh, I thought I had already started.

3932
02:46:29.543 --> 02:46:32.223
(laughter)

3933
02:46:32.223 --> 02:46:33.601
TALIESIN: Wow, real--

3934
02:46:33.601 --> 02:46:35.960
Fjord, are you okay?

3935
02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:37.442
What's happening?

3936
02:46:37.442 --> 02:46:39.192
LIAM: (stilted) Summon barlgura!

3937
02:46:41.343 --> 02:46:42.791
LIAM: Yeah, that's really good.

3938
02:46:42.791 --> 02:46:44.052
LIAM: Bolz-gu-ra.

3939
02:46:44.052 --> 02:46:44.885
MARISHA: It's not--

3940
02:46:44.885 --> 02:46:46.343
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
MARISHA: It's not good.

3941
02:46:46.343 --> 02:46:49.194
SAM: How are you leading it? Are you thinking of--

3942
02:46:49.194 --> 02:46:50.501
SAM: Are you thinking of coming along with--

3943
02:46:50.501 --> 02:46:51.802
TALIESIN: Fjord, your old accent's very weird.

3944
02:46:51.802 --> 02:46:53.402
(laughter)

3945
02:46:53.402 --> 02:46:56.603
I've forgotten how weird that accent is.

3946
02:46:56.603 --> 02:46:58.684
Wow.

3947
02:46:58.684 --> 02:47:00.724
LAURA: I can give you a disguise,

3948
02:47:00.724 --> 02:47:04.254
like a, I can dye your hair.

3949
02:47:04.254 --> 02:47:05.745
I could,

3950
02:47:06.821 --> 02:47:09.240
like, put some eyeliner on you.

3951
02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:10.640
SAM: She could tattoo your face.

3952
02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:13.310
LAURA: I could tattoo your face.

3953
02:47:13.310 --> 02:47:14.143
TALIESIN: Either way--

3954
02:47:14.143 --> 02:47:14.976
SAM: What do you think, coming or no?

3955
02:47:14.976 --> 02:47:16.855
TALIESIN: -- is fine, but it's worth considering.

3956
02:47:16.855 --> 02:47:18.458
LIAM: No, to me everything says no.

3957
02:47:18.458 --> 02:47:19.449
SAM: All right.
TALIESIN: Okay.

3958
02:47:19.449 --> 02:47:21.637
SAM: Well, why don't you stay outside?

3959
02:47:21.637 --> 02:47:23.005
I could always message you, if--

3960
02:47:23.005 --> 02:47:25.050
MARISHA: We could take your cat.

3961
02:47:25.050 --> 02:47:26.261
He loves cats.

3962
02:47:26.261 --> 02:47:27.490
SAM: Oh, that's right!

3963
02:47:27.490 --> 02:47:28.409
TALIESIN: We can take the cat--

3964
02:47:28.409 --> 02:47:30.471
SAM: We could take the cat!

3965
02:47:30.471 --> 02:47:32.708
MARISHA: And things like Sprinkle.

3966
02:47:32.708 --> 02:47:34.028
LAURA: Sprinkle.

3967
02:47:34.028 --> 02:47:37.027
We could turn you into an animal!

3968
02:47:37.027 --> 02:47:38.409
And then,

3969
02:47:38.409 --> 02:47:39.617
you could spy on him!

3970
02:47:39.617 --> 02:47:40.588
What if we were like:

3971
02:47:40.588 --> 02:47:43.687
Oh my god, here's our little Sprinkle, and--

3972
02:47:43.687 --> 02:47:44.828
SAM: A chimpanzee.

3973
02:47:44.828 --> 02:47:47.417
LAURA: No, what if they were friends, and just two weasels,

3974
02:47:47.417 --> 02:47:50.158
and then, you know, we go: Oh, you like Sprinkle so much,

3975
02:47:50.158 --> 02:47:51.725
here, take Cupcake!

3976
02:47:51.725 --> 02:47:54.548
And then he takes Cupcake, and then you're with him

3977
02:47:54.548 --> 02:47:59.130
and then you could spy on him when he's in his bedroom.

3978
02:47:59.130 --> 02:48:01.571
TALIESIN: Or you can just go read and we'll

3979
02:48:01.571 --> 02:48:04.388
have a cat with us.

3980
02:48:04.388 --> 02:48:05.597
You can pop in if you need.

3981
02:48:05.597 --> 02:48:08.447
LIAM: May I have permission to use the Archives here,

3982
02:48:08.447 --> 02:48:09.947
Expositor Lionett?

3983
02:48:11.279 --> 02:48:13.708
MARISHA: Let me think about it.

3984
02:48:13.708 --> 02:48:16.068
Yeah, yeah, I think you're all right.

3985
02:48:16.068 --> 02:48:17.668
TRAVIS: That's a fast review process.

3986
02:48:17.668 --> 02:48:19.527
MARISHA: I had to think about it.

3987
02:48:19.527 --> 02:48:21.765
My brain operates very quickly.

3988
02:48:21.765 --> 02:48:23.141
TALIESIN: Expedited Expositor.

3989
02:48:23.141 --> 02:48:25.047
I've got a bunch of them coming up right now,

3990
02:48:25.047 --> 02:48:26.630
that's really good.
SAM: Oh boy!

3991
02:48:29.377 --> 02:48:30.868
TALIESIN: I've been working on it.

3992
02:48:30.868 --> 02:48:34.607
LIAM: No, I'm going to look up a few things.

3993
02:48:34.607 --> 02:48:35.927
MATT: Is there anything specifically you guys need

3994
02:48:35.927 --> 02:48:38.149
to research while you're here, to look up?

3995
02:48:38.149 --> 02:48:39.402
LIAM: Tharizdun.

3996
02:48:39.402 --> 02:48:40.235
MATT: Okay.

3997
02:48:41.538 --> 02:48:42.371
Specifically?

3998
02:48:42.371 --> 02:48:45.079
MARISHA: There's all those books that I was rambling

3999
02:48:45.079 --> 02:48:48.247
off of that. I recommend him a few books

4000
02:48:48.247 --> 02:48:49.429
that I know of first.

4001
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:50.262
MATT: Like what are you looking for,

4002
02:48:50.262 --> 02:48:52.471
are you looking for, based on the earlier questions

4003
02:48:52.471 --> 02:48:54.527
that were brought up?

4004
02:48:54.527 --> 02:48:58.193
Is there anything specific that you're looking for?

4005
02:48:58.193 --> 02:48:59.534
Like--
LIAM: Well.

4006
02:48:59.534 --> 02:49:00.836
MATT: What holds him in the Abyss?

4007
02:49:00.836 --> 02:49:02.503
What his essence is?

4008
02:49:03.581 --> 02:49:04.812
What are you looking up?

4009
02:49:04.812 --> 02:49:05.671
TALIESIN: Where did it happen?

4010
02:49:05.671 --> 02:49:08.020
LIAM: What it wants, what it's seemed to want,

4011
02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:10.850
what its motives were, how,

4012
02:49:10.850 --> 02:49:13.138
is there a way to find it?

4013
02:49:13.138 --> 02:49:14.490
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Where did it get bound?

4014
02:49:14.490 --> 02:49:15.374
TRAVIS: What are the chains?

4015
02:49:15.374 --> 02:49:16.374
TALIESIN: Who did it?

4016
02:49:16.374 --> 02:49:18.092
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4017
02:49:18.092 --> 02:49:21.191
LIAM: Actually, is there a bathroom
that I could use really quick?

4018
02:49:21.191 --> 02:49:23.202
Is there a bathroom here that I could use?

4019
02:49:23.202 --> 02:49:26.190
MATT: They do have a number of chamber pots available, yeah.

4020
02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:29.941
SAM: Do you need to drop a Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's good!

4021
02:49:29.941 --> 02:49:32.740
LIAM: I excuse myself quickly and cast Fortune's Favor

4022
02:49:32.740 --> 02:49:35.058
onto myself, out of view of anyone.

4023
02:49:35.058 --> 02:49:36.273
And then return.

4024
02:49:36.273 --> 02:49:37.123
MATT: You got it.

4025
02:49:37.123 --> 02:49:37.956
LIAM: Yeah.

4026
02:49:38.828 --> 02:49:39.979
Investigation check, you said?

4027
02:49:39.979 --> 02:49:40.812
MATT: Correct.

4028
02:49:44.125 --> 02:49:44.958
LAURA: Guidance.

4029
02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:47.680
TALIESIN: I don't think we're there.

4030
02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:48.939
LAURA: No, but did we already leave?

4031
02:49:48.939 --> 02:49:50.997
MATT: Well, unless you've left, you're all in there.

4032
02:49:50.997 --> 02:49:53.042
If there's anything you guys want to look up, you can, too.

4033
02:49:53.042 --> 02:49:56.091
LIAM: That's a 25.

4034
02:49:56.091 --> 02:49:57.299
MATT: 25.

4035
02:49:57.299 --> 02:49:58.720
Okay.

4036
02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:01.637
As far as the essence of Tharizdun,

4037
02:50:07.711 --> 02:50:11.279
the scribes who got close enough to record

4038
02:50:11.279 --> 02:50:14.948
what they believed the closest there is to its intent

4039
02:50:14.948 --> 02:50:17.085
were driven mad.

4040
02:50:17.085 --> 02:50:21.537
So it speaks a lot of

4041
02:50:21.537 --> 02:50:24.508
endless growth, devouring.

4042
02:50:24.508 --> 02:50:27.228
It's not a god, it is a world.

4043
02:50:27.228 --> 02:50:31.346
It speaks of it being endless, black, inky,

4044
02:50:31.346 --> 02:50:33.835
filled with teeth and malice,

4045
02:50:33.835 --> 02:50:36.748
laughter, hatred. It just goes into all these

4046
02:50:36.748 --> 02:50:39.156
esoteric descriptions of something that

4047
02:50:39.156 --> 02:50:41.727
isn't a form. All the other Betrayer Gods,

4048
02:50:41.727 --> 02:50:43.729
all the other entities in the pantheon

4049
02:50:43.729 --> 02:50:47.225
that have different interpretations of

4050
02:50:47.225 --> 02:50:51.975
how they're depicted in artwork and tapestries and tomes,

4051
02:50:52.896 --> 02:50:57.765
every single record of Tharizdun seems amorphous

4052
02:50:57.765 --> 02:51:00.836
and without physical manifestation,

4053
02:51:00.836 --> 02:51:05.036
beyond just the actual symbol, which is the seven chains

4054
02:51:05.036 --> 02:51:07.465
and then the black, swirling void amongst them,

4055
02:51:07.465 --> 02:51:09.385
which is the unified symbol

4056
02:51:09.385 --> 02:51:13.505
that has long been held by those that openly worship

4057
02:51:13.505 --> 02:51:17.396
or in ancient temples and such that were built to it.

4058
02:51:17.396 --> 02:51:19.356
As far as what the intent is,

4059
02:51:19.356 --> 02:51:21.045
the best that it can be ascertained

4060
02:51:21.045 --> 02:51:24.520
is to consume and destroy,

4061
02:51:24.520 --> 02:51:29.173
to eventually, to bask over and devour all that is,

4062
02:51:29.173 --> 02:51:30.815
Exandria and beyond,

4063
02:51:30.815 --> 02:51:34.463
and who knows for what purpose and what there is after that,

4064
02:51:34.463 --> 02:51:35.553
if there is a plan after that.

4065
02:51:35.553 --> 02:51:38.271
It is said that those who have come

4066
02:51:38.271 --> 02:51:42.092
to truly understand never came back.

4067
02:51:42.092 --> 02:51:45.009
LIAM: Is there any record or theorizing

4068
02:51:46.897 --> 02:51:49.918
on how or why it was able to be,

4069
02:51:49.918 --> 02:51:52.673
I know that the--

4070
02:51:52.673 --> 02:51:54.543
it's that Beauregard has imparted to us,

4071
02:51:54.543 --> 02:51:58.043
but how or why it was able to be overcome?

4072
02:51:59.684 --> 02:52:01.703
MATT: When it first arrived in the Founding,

4073
02:52:01.703 --> 02:52:04.863
what little bits of information were kept

4074
02:52:04.863 --> 02:52:07.444
and guarded within Vasselheim,

4075
02:52:07.444 --> 02:52:10.764
spoke of, it was never here.

4076
02:52:10.764 --> 02:52:12.604
It began to spill through,

4077
02:52:12.604 --> 02:52:15.993
drawn by either the arrival of the divine,

4078
02:52:15.993 --> 02:52:17.660
the creation of life,

4079
02:52:17.660 --> 02:52:20.614
the imbuing of magic into the world,

4080
02:52:20.614 --> 02:52:23.524
something drew it from wherever it came,

4081
02:52:23.524 --> 02:52:25.271
and it began to spill through.

4082
02:52:25.271 --> 02:52:28.343
And while it was still incomplete in that transition,

4083
02:52:28.343 --> 02:52:30.356
it was originally banished.

4084
02:52:30.356 --> 02:52:32.711
Then during the Calamity,

4085
02:52:32.711 --> 02:52:35.882
something drew it out once more,

4086
02:52:35.882 --> 02:52:38.183
unseated it from that banished plane,

4087
02:52:38.183 --> 02:52:41.423
and began to spill through once more, and grew and grew.

4088
02:52:41.423 --> 02:52:44.282
It was through the fast work and the unified power

4089
02:52:44.282 --> 02:52:46.511
of a number of the Prime Deities,

4090
02:52:46.511 --> 02:52:48.303
that they were able to seal it away.

4091
02:52:48.303 --> 02:52:52.652
And because you rolled so high in your research,

4092
02:52:52.652 --> 02:52:55.012
it is said that there are

4093
02:52:55.012 --> 02:52:57.820
numerous shackles.

4094
02:52:59.172 --> 02:53:00.924
Six in total

4095
02:53:00.924 --> 02:53:04.007
that hold Tharizdun within the Abyss.

4096
02:53:05.514 --> 02:53:08.882
The locations of each shackle fane

4097
02:53:08.882 --> 02:53:11.122
are closely guarded secrets

4098
02:53:11.122 --> 02:53:13.332
within the highest clergy of the Dawnfather

4099
02:53:13.332 --> 02:53:15.380
and Knowing Mentor.

4100
02:53:15.380 --> 02:53:16.871
TRAVIS: You say vein or fane?

4101
02:53:16.871 --> 02:53:17.810
MATT: Fane.

4102
02:53:17.810 --> 02:53:21.092
F-A-N-E, which is a place of power, of worship.

4103
02:53:21.092 --> 02:53:23.122
Like a temple.

4104
02:53:23.122 --> 02:53:25.579
It is feared that the nature of Tharizdun,

4105
02:53:25.579 --> 02:53:27.540
being not entirely like the other divinity

4106
02:53:27.540 --> 02:53:31.140
could shatter the Divine Gate itself if unleashed.

4107
02:53:31.140 --> 02:53:33.831
And no one knows how few shackles must remain

4108
02:53:33.831 --> 02:53:35.331
to keep it at bay.

4109
02:53:37.820 --> 02:53:40.007
And this is what you pulled together from bits and pieces

4110
02:53:40.007 --> 02:53:42.071
of scrolls that have been copied over

4111
02:53:42.071 --> 02:53:43.557
from what is, most of the things

4112
02:53:43.557 --> 02:53:44.938
you read here are hand copied

4113
02:53:44.938 --> 02:53:48.247
from what currently is guarded and held in Vasselheim,

4114
02:53:48.247 --> 02:53:51.386
which is where most of the original remnants

4115
02:53:51.386 --> 02:53:55.397
of that era's history are kept heavily under guard.

4116
02:53:55.397 --> 02:53:58.150
LIAM: I share it with Beauregard
and with the rest of the group.

4117
02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:59.714
MATT: Okay.

4118
02:53:59.714 --> 02:54:02.567
LIAM: But if everyone waited,

4119
02:54:02.567 --> 02:54:04.266
that was the only thing that I was interested

4120
02:54:04.266 --> 02:54:07.747
in researching here, so today.

4121
02:54:07.747 --> 02:54:09.348
SAM: Did that take hours for him to do?

4122
02:54:09.348 --> 02:54:10.800
Because if so, we would have left.

4123
02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:13.378
MATT: I'd say, it probably took a couple hours

4124
02:54:13.378 --> 02:54:14.835
to piece all that information together

4125
02:54:14.835 --> 02:54:16.281
and to find the right books.
LIAM: That's what I thought,

4126
02:54:16.281 --> 02:54:18.030
is that I would be here doing this while they went.

4127
02:54:18.030 --> 02:54:20.134
MATT: In the meantime, what would you guys like to do?

4128
02:54:20.134 --> 02:54:23.087
SAM: We'd like to go to the Halls of Erudition.

4129
02:54:23.087 --> 02:54:23.920
MATT: The Hall of Erudition.

4130
02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:25.124
MARISHA: Before we leave, though,

4131
02:54:25.124 --> 02:54:26.515
I did want to get the--

4132
02:54:26.515 --> 02:54:28.805
sorry, I got a little jumbly on the timeline.

4133
02:54:28.805 --> 02:54:30.021
MATT: It's all good.
MARISHA: Is there anything

4134
02:54:30.021 --> 02:54:35.021
that we should ask Oremid?

4135
02:54:35.557 --> 02:54:36.598
SAM: Hass.
MARISHA: Hass.

4136
02:54:36.598 --> 02:54:38.739
LIAM: Oremid Hass.

4137
02:54:38.739 --> 02:54:39.572
Yeah.

4138
02:54:46.165 --> 02:54:51.165
You could try to subtly ask what the Assembly is doing

4139
02:54:51.202 --> 02:54:52.035
to ensure

4140
02:54:54.174 --> 02:54:56.216
(sighs) the safety of the Empire,

4141
02:54:56.216 --> 02:54:57.299
what they're--

4142
02:54:58.576 --> 02:54:59.696
I don't know, be subtle about it.

4143
02:54:59.696 --> 02:55:01.274
But he is a headmaster, you know,

4144
02:55:01.274 --> 02:55:04.266
he is not in the field so much.

4145
02:55:04.266 --> 02:55:05.834
At least he wasn't, but--

4146
02:55:05.834 --> 02:55:08.917
TRAVIS: Did you just ask Beau to be subtle?

4147
02:55:09.949 --> 02:55:12.132
LIAM: Yeah, I did.
MARISHA: I'm fucking great at being subtle.

4148
02:55:12.132 --> 02:55:14.303
LAURA: She's getting really good at being subtle.

4149
02:55:14.303 --> 02:55:15.303
TALIESIN: Very okay.

4150
02:55:16.455 --> 02:55:18.294
MARISHA: Thanks, Caduceus.

4151
02:55:18.294 --> 02:55:19.962
Thank you, Jester.

4152
02:55:19.962 --> 02:55:22.324
LIAM: Also, Fjord is a very good talker,

4153
02:55:22.324 --> 02:55:26.260
so you know, feel free to share that burden.

4154
02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:28.138
LAURA: Me and Nott are really good talkers, too.

4155
02:55:28.138 --> 02:55:29.505
LIAM: Very.
LAURA: Super, super good.

4156
02:55:29.505 --> 02:55:30.742
LIAM: Lots of talking, yes.

4157
02:55:30.742 --> 02:55:31.575
SAM: Mm-hmm!

4158
02:55:33.205 --> 02:55:35.605
MARISHA and SAM: All right.

4159
02:55:35.605 --> 02:55:37.284
MARISHA: Good luck with your reading.

4160
02:55:37.284 --> 02:55:38.117
SAM: To the Hall!

4161
02:55:38.117 --> 02:55:40.822
MARISHA: Check out Old Gods and Us. It's a great read.

4162
02:55:40.822 --> 02:55:44.192
TALIESIN: We'll meet back up, want to meet back up at,

4163
02:55:44.192 --> 02:55:47.224
a shopping trip afterwards?

4164
02:55:47.224 --> 02:55:50.584
MARISHA: It's very comprehensive, great for the answers.

4165
02:55:50.584 --> 02:55:51.522
TALIESIN: Makes sense.

4166
02:55:51.522 --> 02:55:52.355
All right.

4167
02:55:53.341 --> 02:55:55.030
MATT: All right, are you guys taking Frumpkin with you?

4168
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.863
Or are you--

4169
02:55:55.863 --> 02:55:57.113
TALIESIN: We'd like to.

4170
02:55:58.002 --> 02:56:00.541
LIAM: I mean, you can, but it's not going to do

4171
02:56:00.541 --> 02:56:03.533
what you suggested, because he'll be too far away,

4172
02:56:03.533 --> 02:56:04.893
and I'll be reading.

4173
02:56:04.893 --> 02:56:06.672
TALIESIN: But an extra cuddly animal

4174
02:56:06.672 --> 02:56:07.841
probably will go over well.

4175
02:56:07.841 --> 02:56:09.493
MARISHA: Will he just act like a cat,

4176
02:56:09.493 --> 02:56:10.486
or will he be like--

4177
02:56:10.486 --> 02:56:12.235
LAURA: Weird and not moving.

4178
02:56:12.235 --> 02:56:13.325
MARISHA: Yeah, Frumpkin.

4179
02:56:13.325 --> 02:56:15.304
LIAM: He'll do what I ask him to do.

4180
02:56:15.304 --> 02:56:16.137
TRAVIS: 404.

4181
02:56:17.255 --> 02:56:19.344
MARISHA: (laughs) Not there!

4182
02:56:19.344 --> 02:56:23.535
LIAM: Be especially adorable,

4183
02:56:24.504 --> 02:56:29.301
especially to Hass, and he looks like this.

4184
02:56:29.301 --> 02:56:31.365
And I think of him.

4185
02:56:31.365 --> 02:56:32.573
And then I hand--

4186
02:56:32.573 --> 02:56:33.406
MATT: "Meow!"

4187
02:56:34.533 --> 02:56:36.984
LIAM: -- him to you, because you are like--

4188
02:56:36.984 --> 02:56:39.501
MATT: "Meow!"
LIAM: Sandpaper.

4189
02:56:40.931 --> 02:56:42.244
MATT: All right.

4190
02:56:42.244 --> 02:56:43.663
SAM: Okay.

4191
02:56:43.663 --> 02:56:45.154
TALIESIN: You now have cat hair on your new robe.

4192
02:56:45.154 --> 02:56:47.184
TRAVIS: <i>Don't</i> talk about cat hair.

4193
02:56:47.184 --> 02:56:49.075
LAURA: As we're walking over there--

4194
02:56:49.075 --> 02:56:49.908
MATT: Mm-hmm?

4195
02:56:49.908 --> 02:56:51.053
LAURA: Can I pull Fjord aside--

4196
02:56:51.053 --> 02:56:52.685
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

4197
02:56:52.685 --> 02:56:55.852
LAURA: Like, just to the back of the group?

4198
02:56:56.693 --> 02:56:58.526
Go, just walk forward!

4199
02:56:59.683 --> 02:57:02.184
(whispers) Fjord!
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4200
02:57:02.184 --> 02:57:04.413
LAURA: So, we're in Zadash.

4201
02:57:04.413 --> 02:57:05.504
TRAVIS: Yes.

4202
02:57:05.504 --> 02:57:07.837
LAURA: And The Gentleman is here.

4203
02:57:09.624 --> 02:57:10.457
TRAVIS: Right.

4204
02:57:10.457 --> 02:57:14.774
LAURA: And you know, he could be my dad.

4205
02:57:16.187 --> 02:57:17.465
TRAVIS: Right, yeah, of course.

4206
02:57:17.465 --> 02:57:21.745
LAURA: So I do want to go talk to him,

4207
02:57:21.745 --> 02:57:25.724
but I know what we're doing is really important

4208
02:57:25.724 --> 02:57:29.654
and I don't want to pull the group there.

4209
02:57:29.654 --> 02:57:32.673
Do you think it's stupid of me to want to go

4210
02:57:32.673 --> 02:57:34.993
while all this stuff is going on, or--

4211
02:57:34.993 --> 02:57:36.305
TRAVIS: No!

4212
02:57:36.305 --> 02:57:38.324
No, of course not!

4213
02:57:38.324 --> 02:57:40.254
I mean, this is,

4214
02:57:40.254 --> 02:57:42.764
this is incredibly important to you, isn't it?

4215
02:57:42.764 --> 02:57:44.145
LAURA: Well,

4216
02:57:44.145 --> 02:57:45.665
I mean, I've never met my dad,

4217
02:57:45.665 --> 02:57:48.033
I mean, I did, I guess, but I didn't know

4218
02:57:48.033 --> 02:57:50.473
that it was him, and I thought about him a lot

4219
02:57:50.473 --> 02:57:53.654
when I was growing up, you know, so--

4220
02:57:53.654 --> 02:57:55.734
TRAVIS: That's a tremendous opportunity, Jester,

4221
02:57:55.734 --> 02:57:58.984
you shouldn't just devalue it like that.

4222
02:57:59.913 --> 02:58:01.022
Yes?

4223
02:58:01.022 --> 02:58:01.855
LAURA: Yeah.

4224
02:58:02.942 --> 02:58:03.775
Yeah.

4225
02:58:03.775 --> 02:58:04.662
TRAVIS: Besides, didn't we say that we also thought

4226
02:58:04.662 --> 02:58:08.614
maybe The Gentleman, your dad,

4227
02:58:08.614 --> 02:58:11.054
might know some things?

4228
02:58:11.054 --> 02:58:12.705
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, he might.

4229
02:58:12.705 --> 02:58:16.705
Should we all go as a group, you think?

4230
02:58:16.705 --> 02:58:17.538
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4231
02:58:17.538 --> 02:58:20.145
LAURA: Do you think everyone will want to do that?

4232
02:58:20.145 --> 02:58:22.446
TRAVIS: I think if you tell them how much it means to you,

4233
02:58:22.446 --> 02:58:23.611
they will.

4234
02:58:23.611 --> 02:58:25.144
I certainly do.

4235
02:58:26.926 --> 02:58:27.759
LAURA: Okay.

4236
02:58:28.995 --> 02:58:30.425
But we don't need to go now, we'll go

4237
02:58:30.425 --> 02:58:33.241
after we talk to

4238
02:58:33.241 --> 02:58:35.280
this guy that we're talking to.

4239
02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:37.326
TRAVIS: But we've been here before.

4240
02:58:37.326 --> 02:58:40.934
Let's make sure that we don't leave without doing that.

4241
02:58:40.934 --> 02:58:42.144
LAURA: Okay.

4242
02:58:42.144 --> 02:58:42.977
TRAVIS: All right.

4243
02:58:42.977 --> 02:58:43.810
LAURA: Thank you.

4244
02:58:43.810 --> 02:58:45.254
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4245
02:58:45.254 --> 02:58:48.286
MARISHA: While they talk, I talk with Nott.

4246
02:58:48.286 --> 02:58:49.460
What do you think they're talking about?

4247
02:58:49.460 --> 02:58:51.061
(laughter)

4248
02:58:51.061 --> 02:58:52.539
SAM: Sexy stuff.
MARISHA: You think?

4249
02:58:52.539 --> 02:58:53.522
SAM: Yeah.

4250
02:58:53.522 --> 02:58:57.199
I think, I'm a pretty good judge of this,

4251
02:58:57.199 --> 02:59:00.604
I think Jester likes Fjord.

4252
02:59:00.604 --> 02:59:02.169
MARISHA: Yeah?

4253
02:59:02.169 --> 02:59:04.836
SAM: And I think he likes her back.

4254
02:59:06.274 --> 02:59:08.034
MARISHA: I'm curious.

4255
02:59:08.034 --> 02:59:09.412
Maybe I should check in with Fjord.

4256
02:59:09.412 --> 02:59:10.765
It's been a bit.

4257
02:59:10.765 --> 02:59:12.431
SAM: Yeah. Definitely.

4258
02:59:13.553 --> 02:59:15.854
MARISHA: Think she's confiding in him?

4259
02:59:15.854 --> 02:59:18.874
SAM: I mean, she confides in everybody.

4260
02:59:18.874 --> 02:59:21.657
Just kind of says it, whatever she wants to say

4261
02:59:21.657 --> 02:59:22.815
all the time.

4262
02:59:22.815 --> 02:59:26.424
(laughter)

4263
02:59:26.424 --> 02:59:27.774
MARISHA: It's an interesting point.

4264
02:59:27.774 --> 02:59:30.277
(laughter)

4265
02:59:30.277 --> 02:59:31.110
Hmm.

4266
02:59:32.587 --> 02:59:33.552
Okay.

4267
02:59:33.552 --> 02:59:34.803
Do you want to confide in me?

4268
02:59:34.803 --> 02:59:35.636
SAM: Sure!

4269
02:59:36.964 --> 02:59:40.464
I'll tell you a secret if you tell me one.

4270
02:59:44.227 --> 02:59:45.060
MARISHA: Deal.

4271
02:59:47.188 --> 02:59:50.942
SAM: The flask has been empty this whole time.

4272
02:59:50.942 --> 02:59:51.775
MARISHA: What?

4273
02:59:51.775 --> 02:59:53.225
SAM: Nah, that's not true, I'm sorry.

4274
02:59:53.225 --> 02:59:54.128
I'm just fucking with you.

4275
02:59:54.128 --> 02:59:55.507
That would be cool though, wouldn't it?

4276
02:59:55.507 --> 02:59:56.340
MARISHA: Yeah.

4277
02:59:59.186 --> 03:00:02.485
SAM: I don't have much secrets
that I haven't told you guys, actually.

4278
03:00:02.485 --> 03:00:04.797
MARISHA: That's okay, we'll do this game later.

4279
03:00:04.797 --> 03:00:06.621
SAM: Okay. I'll think-- you know what?

4280
03:00:06.621 --> 03:00:08.079
Think about something.
MARISHA: I'll think about something.

4281
03:00:08.079 --> 03:00:10.601
SAM: And when you have something, come to me.
I'll think about something, too.

4282
03:00:10.601 --> 03:00:13.155
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, because I--

4283
03:00:13.155 --> 03:00:15.737
it was nothing good.

4284
03:00:15.737 --> 03:00:17.177
And now I went to my bad place,

4285
03:00:17.177 --> 03:00:19.410
which was, immediately think of lies.

4286
03:00:19.410 --> 03:00:21.043
SAM: I don't want to hear any of that.

4287
03:00:21.043 --> 03:00:22.588
MARISHA: Oh god!

4288
03:00:22.588 --> 03:00:24.463
Am I confiding in you now?

4289
03:00:26.601 --> 03:00:28.799
Why do I lie all the time?

4290
03:00:28.799 --> 03:00:30.241
What the fuck?
LAURA: (laughs)

4291
03:00:30.241 --> 03:00:31.967
MARISHA: Why was my first thought like,

4292
03:00:31.967 --> 03:00:33.709
what could I say that's not true?

4293
03:00:34.588 --> 03:00:37.809
SAM: You thought-- your instinct was to
lie to me, your friend?

4294
03:00:37.809 --> 03:00:40.249
MARISHA: Well no, it's just-- it's not you,

4295
03:00:40.249 --> 03:00:42.474
I am getting-- I'm actually getting

4296
03:00:42.474 --> 03:00:44.112
a little better at it, fuck.

4297
03:00:44.112 --> 03:00:45.585
God, we're in the fucking public!

4298
03:00:45.585 --> 03:00:46.768
Okay, look.

4299
03:00:46.768 --> 03:00:48.356
I'm getting better at it, but--

4300
03:00:48.356 --> 03:00:50.175
SAM: At what? At lying?

4301
03:00:50.175 --> 03:00:54.892
MARISHA: No, just not feeling like
I have to be something I'm...

4302
03:00:54.892 --> 03:00:56.125
not.

4303
03:00:56.125 --> 03:00:57.489
SAM: Being honest?

4304
03:00:57.489 --> 03:00:58.537
Be honest.

4305
03:00:58.537 --> 03:00:59.370
MARISHA: Being...

4306
03:01:01.321 --> 03:01:02.154
SAM: Yourself?

4307
03:01:02.154 --> 03:01:02.987
MARISHA: Yeah!

4308
03:01:04.929 --> 03:01:05.762
SAM: Boy.

4309
03:01:05.762 --> 03:01:06.849
MARISHA: I didn't just, this is--

4310
03:01:06.849 --> 03:01:08.929
SAM: How did we get here?

4311
03:01:08.929 --> 03:01:12.369
(laughter)

4312
03:01:12.369 --> 03:01:13.670
MARISHA: Holy shit!

4313
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:17.819
SAM: Wow, I feel like I just had a breakthrough with you!

4314
03:01:17.819 --> 03:01:20.089
MARISHA: I'm a little-- I have a heart palpitation!

4315
03:01:20.089 --> 03:01:21.169
(laughter)

4316
03:01:21.169 --> 03:01:23.881
TALIESIN: Can we make a therapy character class, by the way?

4317
03:01:23.881 --> 03:01:25.944
Just as like, as a bard subclass?

4318
03:01:25.944 --> 03:01:26.953
SAM: What just happened?

4319
03:01:26.953 --> 03:01:28.347
MARISHA: I don't know!

4320
03:01:28.347 --> 03:01:30.697
Why do I feel like I'm about to cry?

4321
03:01:30.697 --> 03:01:31.537
SAM: I mean--

4322
03:01:31.537 --> 03:01:32.707
MARISHA: I'm not going to cry--

4323
03:01:32.707 --> 03:01:34.435
SAM: Let it out! No, it's okay!

4324
03:01:34.435 --> 03:01:36.015
TRAVIS: I lean over to Jester and go:

4325
03:01:36.015 --> 03:01:37.503
What do you think they're talking about?

4326
03:01:37.503 --> 03:01:39.320
(laughter)

4327
03:01:41.554 --> 03:01:42.657
TALIESIN: What's everybody doing?

4328
03:01:42.657 --> 03:01:43.682
(laughter)

4329
03:01:43.682 --> 03:01:46.349
MARISHA: I <i>am</i> sweating a lot.
SAM: What a walk!

4330
03:01:47.475 --> 03:01:48.457
MARISHA: God!

4331
03:01:48.457 --> 03:01:49.834
My tattoo stings!

4332
03:01:49.834 --> 03:01:51.089
SAM: Yeah, that's what it is.

4333
03:01:51.089 --> 03:01:52.483
It lets out all these toxins.

4334
03:01:52.483 --> 03:01:54.443
MARISHA: That's true.

4335
03:01:54.443 --> 03:01:55.753
They're coming up.

4336
03:01:55.753 --> 03:01:57.214
SAM: All right, shut up.

4337
03:01:57.214 --> 03:01:58.627
MATT: You guys have passed through the arches

4338
03:01:58.627 --> 03:02:00.822
into the Tri-Spires.

4339
03:02:00.822 --> 03:02:02.555
The familiar--

4340
03:02:02.555 --> 03:02:05.873
LAURA: I like that Caduceus is in between just going--
TALIESIN: I was just watching all this!

4341
03:02:05.873 --> 03:02:07.425
(laughter)

4342
03:02:07.425 --> 03:02:08.497
MATT: And hearing all of it,

4343
03:02:08.497 --> 03:02:10.127
because of his high fucking perception.

4344
03:02:10.127 --> 03:02:13.018
TRAVIS: Fucking hi-fi band radios.
TALIESIN: Everybody's so unhealthy.

4345
03:02:13.018 --> 03:02:14.534
TRAVIS: Catching it all.

4346
03:02:14.534 --> 03:02:16.082
(laughter)

4347
03:02:16.082 --> 03:02:17.229
LIAM: He's also just hears some random dude

4348
03:02:17.229 --> 03:02:19.037
in the Soul go like, "I'm the worst monk!

4349
03:02:19.037 --> 03:02:20.728
"I'm so bad at my job!"

4350
03:02:20.728 --> 03:02:21.561
TALIESIN: Aw, buddy.

4351
03:02:21.561 --> 03:02:25.584
TRAVIS: They fucking rode through on horses,
and now everything's cool?

4352
03:02:25.584 --> 03:02:27.820
LIAM: It's like Superman, he can never turn it off.

4353
03:02:27.820 --> 03:02:29.697
(laughter)

4354
03:02:29.697 --> 03:02:30.635
TALIESIN: Passive, man.

4355
03:02:30.635 --> 03:02:32.218
My passive perception.

4356
03:02:34.137 --> 03:02:36.470
19, passive perception's 19!

4357
03:02:37.657 --> 03:02:41.595
MATT: Passing through the familiar elements of the city,

4358
03:02:41.595 --> 03:02:46.046
you enter the old Zadash Pious District,

4359
03:02:46.046 --> 03:02:48.907
where the Tri-Spire is built upon.

4360
03:02:48.907 --> 03:02:52.337
The familiar gardens of the aristocracy surrounding,

4361
03:02:52.337 --> 03:02:53.347
you can already see

4362
03:02:53.347 --> 03:02:57.530
the massive Gilded Willows neighborhood,

4363
03:02:57.530 --> 03:02:59.067
as it presents to you there,

4364
03:02:59.067 --> 03:03:01.755
you can see the Silken Terrace, the Pillow Trove,

4365
03:03:01.755 --> 03:03:05.735
the familiar glean of the direction of Chastity's Nook,

4366
03:03:05.735 --> 03:03:08.554
where such fine books can be acquired.

4367
03:03:08.554 --> 03:03:10.387
TRAVIS: Fuck, Pumat's here!

4368
03:03:10.387 --> 03:03:11.345
LAURA: Yeah!

4369
03:03:11.345 --> 03:03:13.569
MATT: He's in the Pentamarket,
you guys are in the Tri-Spires.

4370
03:03:13.569 --> 03:03:16.061
TRAVIS: That's what I'm saying, he's close to here.

4371
03:03:16.061 --> 03:03:19.005
TALIESIN: That's where we're going when
we're done with this.

4372
03:03:19.005 --> 03:03:22.794
MATT: And there you see the Halls of Erudition.

4373
03:03:22.794 --> 03:03:26.423
The beautiful bits of white and gray

4374
03:03:26.423 --> 03:03:29.485
marbled, heavy stone towers,

4375
03:03:29.485 --> 03:03:33.314
the walkways that weave between them.

4376
03:03:33.314 --> 03:03:36.645
You can see the beautiful exterior courtyards

4377
03:03:36.645 --> 03:03:38.765
with trees and trimmed hedges

4378
03:03:38.765 --> 03:03:40.853
and little cobblestone walkways.

4379
03:03:40.853 --> 03:03:43.125
It's like this beautifully elegant--

4380
03:03:43.125 --> 03:03:47.018
you can see loosely inspired by elvish design,

4381
03:03:47.018 --> 03:03:48.293
the way everything connects

4382
03:03:48.293 --> 03:03:50.885
and has an organic flow from one place to the next.

4383
03:03:50.885 --> 03:03:53.666
You can see a small class

4384
03:03:53.666 --> 03:03:56.615
of about 10 students in uniforms,

4385
03:03:56.615 --> 03:03:58.114
like these uniform robes

4386
03:03:58.114 --> 03:04:00.335
with a little bit of a fine tabard,

4387
03:04:00.335 --> 03:04:02.954
short, just below the belly, that's hanging there,

4388
03:04:02.954 --> 03:04:04.386
and they're all clutching their books with them,

4389
03:04:04.386 --> 03:04:06.975
and they're being led through by some sort of a teacher

4390
03:04:06.975 --> 03:04:07.965
that's giving them a lecture

4391
03:04:07.965 --> 03:04:10.226
as they walk through the garden to the left.

4392
03:04:10.226 --> 03:04:12.405
You head to the main, heavy staircase

4393
03:04:12.405 --> 03:04:14.994
that is about 20 feet wide and slowly tapers

4394
03:04:14.994 --> 03:04:18.135
until it comes to the double doorway

4395
03:04:18.135 --> 03:04:20.324
that greets you at the top, this beautiful arch

4396
03:04:20.324 --> 03:04:22.153
that starts like a natural apex

4397
03:04:22.153 --> 03:04:23.582
and then curves up into this

4398
03:04:23.582 --> 03:04:27.967
carved, ivory spiral on each side

4399
03:04:27.967 --> 03:04:29.524
before where the doors come and meet.

4400
03:04:29.524 --> 03:04:31.084
And the doors themselves are cut in a similar shape,

4401
03:04:31.084 --> 03:04:33.973
so as one of them is partially open,

4402
03:04:33.973 --> 03:04:36.192
and you can see there are two--

4403
03:04:36.192 --> 03:04:37.734
they're the the crownsguard,

4404
03:04:37.734 --> 03:04:39.522
but you see them dressed in similar attire

4405
03:04:39.522 --> 03:04:41.454
as some of the students, to signify

4406
03:04:41.454 --> 03:04:44.792
the coloration of the halls here.

4407
03:04:44.792 --> 03:04:47.142
Upon approach, they give you all a look

4408
03:04:47.142 --> 03:04:49.725
and one of the guards glances down.

4409
03:04:50.742 --> 03:04:53.614
"Could I inquire your business here?"

4410
03:04:53.614 --> 03:04:54.447
SAM: Fjord!

4411
03:04:54.447 --> 03:04:56.197
TRAVIS: What? Oh, yes.

4412
03:04:57.254 --> 03:04:58.214
Hello.

4413
03:04:58.214 --> 03:05:02.234
We've been sent here on a mission to gather some knowledge.

4414
03:05:02.234 --> 03:05:05.785
If you wouldn't mind showing us to...

4415
03:05:05.785 --> 03:05:07.313
the stacks.

4416
03:05:07.313 --> 03:05:08.374
LAURA: No.

4417
03:05:08.374 --> 03:05:09.207
TRAVIS: Nope.

4418
03:05:09.207 --> 03:05:11.233
(laughter)

4419
03:05:11.233 --> 03:05:12.502
MATT: "If you are seeking research,

4420
03:05:12.502 --> 03:05:16.063
"you'll have better luck with the Archive.

4421
03:05:16.063 --> 03:05:17.890
"This is a place of learning.

4422
03:05:17.890 --> 03:05:19.283
"If you are not a student--"

4423
03:05:19.283 --> 03:05:23.502
LAURA: I pull out the letter that Yussa gave us.

4424
03:05:23.502 --> 03:05:24.577
And...

4425
03:05:25.693 --> 03:05:27.051
it's, um...

4426
03:05:30.792 --> 03:05:32.044
MATT: You say, "It's, um."

4427
03:05:32.044 --> 03:05:34.342
LAURA: It's-- you know, it's--

4428
03:05:34.342 --> 03:05:35.901
we're here on behalf of--

4429
03:05:35.901 --> 03:05:37.134
SAM: We're here to see someone.

4430
03:05:37.134 --> 03:05:39.499
LAURA: We're here on behalf of Yussa.

4431
03:05:39.499 --> 03:05:42.593
SAM: The Headmaster Oremid Hass.

4432
03:05:42.593 --> 03:05:46.035
The Archmage of Cultivation, perhaps you've heard of him?

4433
03:05:46.902 --> 03:05:49.222
MATT: Both of you make persuasion checks.

4434
03:05:49.222 --> 03:05:51.153
SAM: I got a little extra charisma to work with.

4435
03:05:51.153 --> 03:05:51.986
LAURA: Woo!

4436
03:05:51.986 --> 03:05:54.374
I'm going to guide myself beforehand!

4437
03:05:54.374 --> 03:05:55.870
Natural 20!

4438
03:05:55.870 --> 03:05:57.245
(exclaiming)

4439
03:05:58.414 --> 03:05:59.542
SAM: 11 for me.

4440
03:05:59.542 --> 03:06:00.375
MATT: Okay.

4441
03:06:00.375 --> 03:06:01.458
Not terrible.

4442
03:06:02.772 --> 03:06:06.382
Between the two of you-- (laughs)

4443
03:06:06.382 --> 03:06:07.411
Between the two of you,

4444
03:06:07.411 --> 03:06:10.798
the soldier looks at the paper, goes,

4445
03:06:10.798 --> 03:06:14.891
"I will inquire if he is available.

4446
03:06:14.891 --> 03:06:16.561
"Wait here a moment."

4447
03:06:16.561 --> 03:06:18.153
Heads inside.

4448
03:06:18.153 --> 03:06:19.542
As the door opens up,

4449
03:06:19.542 --> 03:06:22.593
you can see the cut portion of the door

4450
03:06:22.593 --> 03:06:25.896
has this nice little tapering top to it.

4451
03:06:25.896 --> 03:06:28.120
TALIESIN: That's very impressive.

4452
03:06:28.120 --> 03:06:32.152
MATT: The front of them very smooth, polished,

4453
03:06:32.152 --> 03:06:35.383
the details are more on the exterior of it.

4454
03:06:36.300 --> 03:06:39.072
About 15 or so minutes pass

4455
03:06:39.072 --> 03:06:40.714
of you tapping your feet on the ground

4456
03:06:40.714 --> 03:06:43.069
before you hear footfalls begin to approach again.

4457
03:06:43.069 --> 03:06:45.160
The other guard just watching you quietly

4458
03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:47.160
as you all wait outside.

4459
03:06:48.258 --> 03:06:49.752
Until eventually the door once again,

4460
03:06:49.752 --> 03:06:51.770
(door creaking) opens, you hear it

4461
03:06:51.770 --> 03:06:53.362
scraping against the (grinding)

4462
03:06:53.362 --> 03:06:55.232
stone of the floor beneath it,

4463
03:06:55.232 --> 03:06:57.952
and the guard arrives, and the secondary guard,

4464
03:06:57.952 --> 03:07:00.770
both flanking to each side,

4465
03:07:00.770 --> 03:07:02.848
Oremid Hass, who you've seen once before.

4466
03:07:02.848 --> 03:07:05.992
You see standing there, somewhat short,

4467
03:07:05.992 --> 03:07:10.071
maybe like, five foot six.

4468
03:07:10.071 --> 03:07:11.546
But a stocky,

4469
03:07:12.821 --> 03:07:14.202
humanoid man,

4470
03:07:14.202 --> 03:07:19.050
appearing human, but the skin is a very dark brown

4471
03:07:19.050 --> 03:07:20.501
with a unique texture to it,

4472
03:07:20.501 --> 03:07:23.152
with each shift, dust seems to almost fall

4473
03:07:23.152 --> 03:07:25.910
from elements of the joints.

4474
03:07:25.910 --> 03:07:28.130
The eyes are pitch black.

4475
03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:29.288
SAM: Whoa.
LAURA: Awesome.

4476
03:07:29.288 --> 03:07:32.512
MATT: Like tiny, polished marbles of obsidian.

4477
03:07:32.512 --> 03:07:33.345
LAURA: Sick!

4478
03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:37.609
MATT: Steps out with similar robes

4479
03:07:37.609 --> 03:07:39.520
to the other instructors you've seen,

4480
03:07:39.520 --> 03:07:41.101
though his are much more elaborate,

4481
03:07:41.101 --> 03:07:43.470
and you can see there's these two long tassels

4482
03:07:43.470 --> 03:07:44.891
that go over each shoulder,

4483
03:07:44.891 --> 03:07:47.773
that drag on the ground behind him

4484
03:07:47.773 --> 03:07:49.472
for an additional two feet.

4485
03:07:49.472 --> 03:07:51.321
They stay clean, for as much

4486
03:07:51.321 --> 03:07:53.653
as they're brought across the grounds behind him

4487
03:07:53.653 --> 03:07:55.344
on the floor itself.

4488
03:07:55.344 --> 03:07:57.632
Upon stepping out, arms still crossed

4489
03:07:57.632 --> 03:08:00.152
and these heavy, long sleeves that drape down

4490
03:08:00.152 --> 03:08:01.985
almost past the knees.

4491
03:08:02.923 --> 03:08:04.228
Looking over all of you,

4492
03:08:04.228 --> 03:08:07.624
this short, dark, kinked hair,

4493
03:08:07.624 --> 03:08:12.580
and this bright smile, but a stern glare to the eyes

4494
03:08:12.580 --> 03:08:15.079
that belittles a social presentation,

4495
03:08:15.079 --> 03:08:18.912
but a very, very intense probing look.

4496
03:08:21.727 --> 03:08:22.560
"Hello.

4497
03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:24.410
"You have made your way to the halls,

4498
03:08:24.410 --> 03:08:27.500
"you have requested my presence.

4499
03:08:27.500 --> 03:08:28.925
"I have but a few moments

4500
03:08:28.925 --> 03:08:32.350
"and would be quite curious as to what you..."

4501
03:08:40.437 --> 03:08:42.859
The corner of the mouth curls into a smile.

4502
03:08:42.859 --> 03:08:45.208
"(laughs)

4503
03:08:45.208 --> 03:08:49.597
"Yussa, you old fool. (laughs)

4504
03:08:49.597 --> 03:08:52.047
"You have my attention.

4505
03:08:52.047 --> 03:08:55.795
"What has he tangled you a lot up in, yes?"

4506
03:08:55.795 --> 03:08:59.645
TALIESIN: We would value some privacy for this conversation.

4507
03:08:59.645 --> 03:09:02.429
Is there somewhere secure?

4508
03:09:03.304 --> 03:09:04.525
MATT: "Allow them to enter.

4509
03:09:04.525 --> 03:09:06.067
"Follow me."

4510
03:09:06.067 --> 03:09:08.123
Turns around, and follows you.

4511
03:09:08.123 --> 03:09:10.677
And you guys watch as, with each step,

4512
03:09:10.677 --> 03:09:14.645
that bit of dust that seems to

4513
03:09:14.645 --> 03:09:17.547
drift off of the side of the neck as it turns,

4514
03:09:17.547 --> 03:09:20.812
with each footfall there's this gentle little trail

4515
03:09:20.812 --> 03:09:23.333
of almost like gravel

4516
03:09:23.333 --> 03:09:26.133
or very, very fine powder, like a gray powder

4517
03:09:26.133 --> 03:09:27.795
that's left in his wake,

4518
03:09:27.795 --> 03:09:30.353
that slowly just vanishes a few feet

4519
03:09:30.353 --> 03:09:32.875
after he passes in front of you,

4520
03:09:32.875 --> 03:09:35.253
leaving no trail behind.

4521
03:09:35.253 --> 03:09:37.453
Heading into the main chamber,

4522
03:09:37.453 --> 03:09:40.344
this is a beautiful, beautiful

4523
03:09:41.461 --> 03:09:43.544
open foyer type region

4524
03:09:43.544 --> 03:09:46.235
of the entryway to the Halls.

4525
03:09:46.235 --> 03:09:47.813
You can see its multiple archways

4526
03:09:47.813 --> 03:09:50.045
with pillars all throughout that seem to give

4527
03:09:50.045 --> 03:09:52.213
this lattice type pattern

4528
03:09:52.213 --> 03:09:54.264
of archway after archway after archway,

4529
03:09:54.264 --> 03:09:56.211
each leading to the next, to the point where

4530
03:09:56.211 --> 03:09:58.620
everything is connected in this continuous

4531
03:09:58.620 --> 03:10:02.952
beautiful, organic wave after wave visual spectrum.

4532
03:10:02.952 --> 03:10:05.590
The sunlight that comes in from the side,

4533
03:10:05.590 --> 03:10:07.870
tall windows, lights, everything with this

4534
03:10:07.870 --> 03:10:10.625
warm sunlight hue,

4535
03:10:10.625 --> 03:10:15.625
like an eggshell and a soft yellow light.

4536
03:10:15.668 --> 03:10:17.158
LAURA: This place is gorgeous!

4537
03:10:17.158 --> 03:10:18.301
MARISHA: This is awesome.

4538
03:10:18.301 --> 03:10:21.117
MATT: You can hear the echoes of voices down distant halls.

4539
03:10:21.117 --> 03:10:22.923
And you can see, it splits into three different hallways

4540
03:10:22.923 --> 03:10:25.081
immediately as you enter the chamber.

4541
03:10:25.081 --> 03:10:28.027
There is a circular desk of some kind in the center

4542
03:10:28.027 --> 03:10:30.629
where a number of books and records are being kept

4543
03:10:30.629 --> 03:10:32.708
for those that pass in and out,

4544
03:10:32.708 --> 03:10:34.291
students' arrivals,

4545
03:10:35.509 --> 03:10:37.189
anything else, and as you guys approach,

4546
03:10:37.189 --> 03:10:41.160
the person at the desk, this older woman,

4547
03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:45.944
looks to be halfling in lineage,

4548
03:10:47.610 --> 03:10:50.141
perched up on the chair, lifts a quill

4549
03:10:50.141 --> 03:10:51.998
to ask a question, Oremid just puts a hand up

4550
03:10:51.998 --> 03:10:55.291
and shakes the head and she goes back to her chair.

4551
03:10:55.291 --> 03:10:57.851
Oremid--
SAM: Hold my calls.

4552
03:10:57.851 --> 03:11:00.686
MATT: Leading you off to the right hand hallway,

4553
03:11:00.686 --> 03:11:02.021
which is-- this hallway,

4554
03:11:02.021 --> 03:11:04.251
while it's maybe 20 foot from side to side,

4555
03:11:04.251 --> 03:11:06.027
stands about 80 foot to its apex,

4556
03:11:06.027 --> 03:11:07.910
the whole thing has this gradual arch to it.

4557
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:09.631
LAURA: That's so cool.

4558
03:11:09.631 --> 03:11:10.464
MATT: Beautiful.

4559
03:11:11.381 --> 03:11:14.099
It's-- you can see why, you know,

4560
03:11:14.099 --> 03:11:16.067
why this is considered a place of higher learning,

4561
03:11:16.067 --> 03:11:18.007
and even just looking at this, you can only imagine

4562
03:11:18.007 --> 03:11:20.621
what the Soltryce Academy must look like.

4563
03:11:20.621 --> 03:11:22.981
About four or five doors down,

4564
03:11:22.981 --> 03:11:24.931
you are led into a left hand chamber,

4565
03:11:24.931 --> 03:11:28.029
and there appears to be a warm meeting room.

4566
03:11:28.029 --> 03:11:32.080
The coloration shifts from the white and grays

4567
03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:35.901
that marbled swirl that seems to be

4568
03:11:35.901 --> 03:11:39.549
the bulk of the interior and exterior design of the Halls,

4569
03:11:39.549 --> 03:11:43.381
and instead it has a dark forest green color.

4570
03:11:43.381 --> 03:11:45.520
The wood is a deep, dark mahogany,

4571
03:11:45.520 --> 03:11:48.720
and you can see there's an octangular table

4572
03:11:48.720 --> 03:11:50.211
with chairs set up around.

4573
03:11:50.211 --> 03:11:52.261
Oremid goes around to the opposite side and sits down,

4574
03:11:52.261 --> 03:11:53.901
arms crossed.

4575
03:11:53.901 --> 03:11:55.989
Addresses for you all to sit down.

4576
03:11:55.989 --> 03:11:57.837
SAM: By the way, before we got here,

4577
03:11:57.837 --> 03:12:01.069
I probably would have disguised myself as something else.

4578
03:12:01.069 --> 03:12:02.491
I assume, right?

4579
03:12:02.491 --> 03:12:05.131
We're in Empire lands now?

4580
03:12:05.131 --> 03:12:06.600
MATT: You are.

4581
03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:07.600
LAURA: But--

4582
03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:09.381
MATT: You've gotten around before with your mask, but you--

4583
03:12:09.381 --> 03:12:10.814
SAM: I don't have a mask--
MATT: You don't have your mask anymore,

4584
03:12:10.814 --> 03:12:12.308
so you probably would have.

4585
03:12:12.308 --> 03:12:13.300
SAM: Yeah.

4586
03:12:13.300 --> 03:12:15.482
MATT: I'll trust you to have the foresight on that, so.

4587
03:12:15.482 --> 03:12:16.457
SAM: Okay.

4588
03:12:16.457 --> 03:12:18.869
I'll have made myself a halfling.

4589
03:12:18.869 --> 03:12:20.039
MATT: You got it.

4590
03:12:20.039 --> 03:12:20.872
All right.

4591
03:12:20.872 --> 03:12:23.611
So you all enter the chamber.

4592
03:12:23.611 --> 03:12:24.878
"So.

4593
03:12:24.878 --> 03:12:27.229
"It is strange for such a motley crew

4594
03:12:27.229 --> 03:12:29.979
"to be so heavily involved with a...

4595
03:12:32.771 --> 03:12:37.771
"I would say, oddball as Yussa, so far south.

4596
03:12:37.949 --> 03:12:40.829
"And then to be sent to me by name via missive

4597
03:12:40.829 --> 03:12:43.187
"is very intriguing.

4598
03:12:43.187 --> 03:12:45.320
"Do tell me, what is your business,

4599
03:12:45.320 --> 03:12:48.359
"what has brought you to the Halls?"

4600
03:12:48.359 --> 03:12:51.225
LAURA: Well, Yussa trusts you.

4601
03:12:52.659 --> 03:12:53.659
MATT: "Very well."

4602
03:12:54.912 --> 03:12:59.904
LAURA: And what we've been through is pretty bad.

4603
03:13:02.800 --> 03:13:03.912
I can keep going.

4604
03:13:03.912 --> 03:13:07.600
SAM: We worry for the fate of the Empire.

4605
03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:08.433
LAURA: I mean, yeah.

4606
03:13:08.433 --> 03:13:12.512
SAM: And are here to tell you some information

4607
03:13:12.512 --> 03:13:15.698
and see if you've heard of anything

4608
03:13:15.698 --> 03:13:17.938
that you could convey to us

4609
03:13:17.938 --> 03:13:22.171
that would help us protect the Empire from impending doom.

4610
03:13:22.171 --> 03:13:24.270
LAURA: And, you know, the world.

4611
03:13:24.270 --> 03:13:26.278
MATT: "Well, these things seem to align

4612
03:13:26.278 --> 03:13:30.078
"with my personal preferences, so yes, let us continue."

4613
03:13:30.078 --> 03:13:32.839
LAURA: Okay, so there was this group of people

4614
03:13:32.839 --> 03:13:35.971
that were worshiping this Angel of Irons, right?

4615
03:13:35.971 --> 03:13:37.771
And they took our friend,

4616
03:13:37.771 --> 03:13:39.680
and she didn't want to go with them,

4617
03:13:39.680 --> 03:13:41.920
but this guy is super powerful,

4618
03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:45.753
and then we were scrying on them,

4619
03:13:45.753 --> 03:13:50.077
and we found out, it wasn't the Angel of Irons at all!

4620
03:13:50.077 --> 03:13:52.232
It was the Chained Oblivion.

4621
03:13:52.232 --> 03:13:54.341
And he's trying to break into the world.

4622
03:13:54.341 --> 03:13:55.701
Basically.

4623
03:13:55.701 --> 03:13:57.000
SAM: Big, it's a big drop.

4624
03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.461
It's a big lore drop there.

4625
03:13:59.461 --> 03:14:02.640
Do you know what Tharizdun is?

4626
03:14:02.640 --> 03:14:04.473
MATT: "I am well aware."

4627
03:14:04.473 --> 03:14:06.319
MARISHA: We have proof.

4628
03:14:06.319 --> 03:14:09.088
MATT: You can see there's a look in the face of,

4629
03:14:09.088 --> 03:14:11.000
who the fuck are these people to walk into my house

4630
03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:12.429
and tell me such ridiculous things,

4631
03:14:12.429 --> 03:14:13.680
but then you see he glances down

4632
03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:15.920
at the partially unrolled missive that still sits there

4633
03:14:15.920 --> 03:14:18.077
and looks over the signature.

4634
03:14:19.568 --> 03:14:21.160
"Hmm."

4635
03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:24.200
TALIESIN: They seem to be making headway.

4636
03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:25.659
MATT: "Do we know where, when?

4637
03:14:25.659 --> 03:14:26.656
"Who's involved?"

4638
03:14:26.656 --> 03:14:28.420
TALIESIN: Ev-- well--

4639
03:14:28.420 --> 03:14:30.222
TRAVIS: That's a bit of a larger story.

4640
03:14:30.222 --> 03:14:32.788
It seems that there's a third party involved

4641
03:14:32.788 --> 03:14:36.148
in bringing both the Dynasty and the Empire to blows,

4642
03:14:36.148 --> 03:14:39.260
as maybe a means of distraction or as a way to upset

4643
03:14:39.260 --> 03:14:41.268
the order of things, but

4644
03:14:41.268 --> 03:14:43.609
there have been devices planted on both continents

4645
03:14:43.609 --> 03:14:46.118
to poke holes between here and the Abyss,

4646
03:14:46.118 --> 03:14:47.196
creatures have escaped,

4647
03:14:47.196 --> 03:14:49.209
we've removed or destroyed some of them,

4648
03:14:49.209 --> 03:14:52.007
but we seem to have uncovered at least the intention

4649
03:14:52.007 --> 03:14:54.718
to weaken the distance between the planes.

4650
03:14:54.718 --> 03:14:57.461
MARISHA: I reach into my pouch and pull out the fragment

4651
03:14:57.461 --> 03:15:01.942
of the homemade portal device, toss it at him.

4652
03:15:01.942 --> 03:15:06.761
TALIESIN: We believe there are agents
on both sides of the war

4653
03:15:06.761 --> 03:15:11.761
working towards possibly freeing this entity.

4654
03:15:12.230 --> 03:15:14.480
TRAVIS: Most of these were found in Xhorhas,

4655
03:15:14.480 --> 03:15:18.212
but we do believe someone from Xhorhas allowed

4656
03:15:18.212 --> 03:15:21.561
one of the dodecahedrons to be brought over to the Empire

4657
03:15:21.561 --> 03:15:23.742
in an effort to upset balance.

4658
03:15:23.742 --> 03:15:27.159
MATT: "What is this dodecahedron you speak of?"

4659
03:15:28.041 --> 03:15:32.092
TRAVIS: It is an item that the Xhorhasians worship,

4660
03:15:32.092 --> 03:15:35.820
it's a structure, a geometric shape,

4661
03:15:35.820 --> 03:15:38.190
they treat it as a deity, a god.

4662
03:15:38.190 --> 03:15:40.910
MATT: "Where did you acquire this information?"

4663
03:15:40.910 --> 03:15:43.577
TRAVIS: We spent some time in Xhorhas.

4664
03:15:44.930 --> 03:15:46.487
MATT: "And that is where you learned that

4665
03:15:46.487 --> 03:15:49.772
"one of these dodecahedrons was taken?"

4666
03:15:49.772 --> 03:15:50.605
LAURA: Yeah.

4667
03:15:51.520 --> 03:15:55.237
MARISHA: We actually learned a bit here in the Empire first.

4668
03:15:57.092 --> 03:15:59.742
Is that a problem for you, Oremid?

4669
03:15:59.742 --> 03:16:01.942
MATT: "It's not a problem, it's just...

4670
03:16:04.134 --> 03:16:04.967
"not...

4671
03:16:06.441 --> 03:16:08.191
"not common knowledge."

4672
03:16:09.078 --> 03:16:10.577
TALIESIN: So you did know?

4673
03:16:10.577 --> 03:16:12.337
MATT: "I'm aware."

4674
03:16:12.337 --> 03:16:14.457
TRAVIS: You can see that we are obviously not the type

4675
03:16:14.457 --> 03:16:19.040
to be privy to this level of information,

4676
03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:21.656
and I think you know that by possessing that letter,

4677
03:16:21.656 --> 03:16:23.518
we're obviously involved in

4678
03:16:23.518 --> 03:16:25.097
something far above our pay grade.

4679
03:16:25.097 --> 03:16:26.178
MATT: "Yes, you are.

4680
03:16:26.178 --> 03:16:28.201
"And I would recommend you tell no one else

4681
03:16:28.201 --> 03:16:30.646
"that you know of this."

4682
03:16:30.646 --> 03:16:31.479
TRAVIS: Agreed.

4683
03:16:31.479 --> 03:16:33.234
MATT: "You're lucky you came to me first."

4684
03:16:33.234 --> 03:16:34.444
MARISHA: Insight check.

4685
03:16:34.444 --> 03:16:35.956
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was about to say.

4686
03:16:35.956 --> 03:16:37.248
MATT: Both of you guys make an insight check.

4687
03:16:37.248 --> 03:16:39.047
MARISHA: Why doesn't he want us--

4688
03:16:39.047 --> 03:16:39.886
LAURA: Well, yeah.

4689
03:16:39.886 --> 03:16:41.828
TALIESIN: I've been watching him like a hawk.

4690
03:16:41.828 --> 03:16:44.068
SAM: We just said three things that could get us arrested.

4691
03:16:44.068 --> 03:16:45.375
TALIESIN: 19.

4692
03:16:45.375 --> 03:16:47.033
Oh, insight, hold on.

4693
03:16:47.033 --> 03:16:48.686
19.

4694
03:16:48.686 --> 03:16:49.577
MARISHA: 27.

4695
03:16:49.577 --> 03:16:51.213
LAURA: Woo!

4696
03:16:51.213 --> 03:16:52.556
SAM: Whispers!

4697
03:16:52.556 --> 03:16:54.471
TRAVIS: Dual whisper, bring both your ears here

4698
03:16:54.471 --> 03:16:56.764
so he can tickle at the same time!

4699
03:16:56.764 --> 03:16:58.123
TALIESIN: You rolled so much better than I did.

4700
03:16:58.123 --> 03:16:59.865
SAM: What's in the shop right now, Laura?

4701
03:16:59.865 --> 03:17:01.305
LAURA: Mm!
TRAVIS: Is there a whisper card?

4702
03:17:01.305 --> 03:17:02.444
SAM: There's not.

4703
03:17:02.444 --> 03:17:03.545
LAURA: This is!

4704
03:17:03.545 --> 03:17:05.425
SAM: Oh, this lovely blanket that's been keeping

4705
03:17:05.425 --> 03:17:06.804
my butt and back warm?

4706
03:17:06.804 --> 03:17:07.637
LAURA: Yeah!

4707
03:17:07.637 --> 03:17:10.044
Mm, smells like Sam butt!

4708
03:17:10.044 --> 03:17:11.727
SAM: Sam butt!

4709
03:17:11.727 --> 03:17:12.868
LAURA: And!

4710
03:17:12.868 --> 03:17:14.485
Some awesome pins!

4711
03:17:14.485 --> 03:17:16.348
Check them out!

4712
03:17:16.348 --> 03:17:18.119
They're chibi!

4713
03:17:18.119 --> 03:17:19.578
SAM: They're chibi.

4714
03:17:19.578 --> 03:17:21.328
LAURA: And they're super cute.

4715
03:17:22.178 --> 03:17:23.011
SAM: What?

4716
03:17:23.011 --> 03:17:24.188
Other whispers?

4717
03:17:24.188 --> 03:17:25.639
A double whisper?

4718
03:17:25.639 --> 03:17:27.187
Have we ever done that before?

4719
03:17:27.187 --> 03:17:28.687
Why not just tell everyone?

4720
03:17:28.687 --> 03:17:30.177
LAURA: They're going to just tell everyone.

4721
03:17:30.177 --> 03:17:31.479
SAM: It's so soft!

4722
03:17:31.479 --> 03:17:33.247
LAURA: I know, it so is!

4723
03:17:33.247 --> 03:17:35.943
MARISHA: It is <i>so</i> soft.

4724
03:17:35.943 --> 03:17:36.876
I love it so much.

4725
03:17:36.876 --> 03:17:39.809
TRAVIS: Also two seasons of Legend of Vox Machina!

4726
03:17:39.809 --> 03:17:40.995
24 episodes!

4727
03:17:40.995 --> 03:17:42.117
Even more story!

4728
03:17:42.117 --> 03:17:44.120
SAM: See it internationally!

4729
03:17:50.610 --> 03:17:51.443
MARISHA: Oremid.

4730
03:17:52.882 --> 03:17:57.882
I know as you said, we appear to be quite the motley crew.

4731
03:17:58.469 --> 03:18:01.202
And you're not wrong.
TRAVIS: (guitar riff)

4732
03:18:01.202 --> 03:18:02.900
MARISHA: We're dope.

4733
03:18:02.900 --> 03:18:05.146
SAM: (laughs)

4734
03:18:05.146 --> 03:18:07.829
MARISHA: But that leniency

4735
03:18:09.530 --> 03:18:11.947
has granted us the ability to

4736
03:18:15.290 --> 03:18:17.373
infiltrate certain lines.

4737
03:18:18.252 --> 03:18:19.981
MATT: "Apparently, if you've been to Xhorhas

4738
03:18:19.981 --> 03:18:21.669
"during this conflict, that says a lot

4739
03:18:21.669 --> 03:18:23.669
"about your capabilities.

4740
03:18:24.629 --> 03:18:26.437
"Now there have been...

"rumors

"the more private echelons of the Empire

"of Imperial defectors working with the enemy.

03:18:41.052 --> 03:18:45.114
"There has been, as far as I know, no identification.

4746
03:18:45.114 --> 03:18:50.114
"Would this perchance pertain to the journeys you've made?"

4747
03:18:50.324 --> 03:18:51.964
MARISHA: Honestly, it's hard to say.

4748
03:18:51.964 --> 03:18:55.903
We've found evidence of potential defectors

4749
03:18:55.903 --> 03:18:57.084
on our path.

4750
03:18:57.084 --> 03:18:59.524
MATT: "As you are an Expositor."

4751
03:18:59.524 --> 03:19:00.712
MARISHA: Yes, sir.

4752
03:19:00.712 --> 03:19:04.612
MATT: "I take it this was part of your intended mission?"

4753
03:19:07.554 --> 03:19:08.737
MARISHA: Yes, sir.

4754
03:19:12.114 --> 03:19:12.947
MATT: "Well.

4755
03:19:14.650 --> 03:19:16.925
"What I do know is that, whatever...

4756
03:19:18.817 --> 03:19:21.452
"whatever Ludinus is attempting to ascertain

"I do not know if I agree with the ramifications of this,

"nor can I speak to as this beacon being specifically

03:19:34.692 --> 03:19:37.092
"the reasons for this conflict."

4762
03:19:37.092 --> 03:19:38.562
MARISHA: I don't think the beacon <i>is</i> specifically

4763
03:19:38.562 --> 03:19:40.052
the reasons for this conflict.

4764
03:19:40.052 --> 03:19:44.017
MATT: "There have been many, many things

4765
03:19:44.017 --> 03:19:47.701
"guiding this tension for quite some time.

4766

"This was just the--"

4767
03:19:51.122 --> 03:19:53.132
MARISHA: Perfect excuse.

4768
03:19:53.132 --> 03:19:54.505
MATT: "Perhaps."

4769
03:19:54.505 --> 03:19:56.185
MARISHA: Beyond the two rivaling factions,

4770
03:19:56.185 --> 03:19:59.654
between the Empire and Xhorhas,

4771
03:19:59.654 --> 03:20:04.487
and this potential incursion from the Abyss and Tharizdun,

4772
03:20:06.214 --> 03:20:11.214
Tharizdun seems to have unified certain elements

4773
03:20:11.294 --> 03:20:13.461
between devils and demons.

4774
03:20:15.523 --> 03:20:19.581
I don't think you worrying about the conflict

4775
03:20:20.963 --> 03:20:22.380
between these two

4776
03:20:25.185 --> 03:20:26.268
mortal beings

4777
03:20:27.915 --> 03:20:30.054
should be your main point of interest.

4778
03:20:30.054 --> 03:20:32.503
MATT: "So you are agreeing with me that this beacon

4779
03:20:32.503 --> 03:20:36.453
"and this cult are possibly unrelated?"

4780
03:20:37.465 --> 03:20:38.875
MARISHA: Yeah.

4781
03:20:38.875 --> 03:20:40.422
MATT: "All right.

4782
03:20:40.422 --> 03:20:42.505
"We're on the same page."

4783
03:20:42.505 --> 03:20:47.105
SAM: If we were able to expose,

4784
03:20:47.105 --> 03:20:48.195
as you called them,

4785
03:20:48.195 --> 03:20:50.206
a defector among your midst,

4786
03:20:50.206 --> 03:20:53.012
what would happen to that person?

4787
03:20:53.012 --> 03:20:57.275
MATT: "If there was Imperial members
who defected to Xhorhas,

4788
03:20:57.275 --> 03:20:58.606
"they would be executed."

4789
03:20:58.606 --> 03:21:01.524
SAM: Well, what if they weren't defecting to Xhorhas,

4790
03:21:01.524 --> 03:21:02.884
what if they were just working with

4791
03:21:02.884 --> 03:21:04.755
this strange, third organization

4792
03:21:04.755 --> 03:21:06.105
that's trying to--

4793
03:21:06.105 --> 03:21:08.475
MATT: "If there are cultists within our immediate midst,

4794
03:21:08.475 --> 03:21:11.686
"they would probably be given the same.

4795
03:21:11.686 --> 03:21:15.025
"They would be hunted by the Vollstreckers,

03:21:15.025 --> 03:21:19.241
"and tortured and probably never seen again."

4797
03:21:22.045 --> 03:21:25.254
TRAVIS: May I ask a question that's
insanely above my pay grade,

4798
03:21:25.254 --> 03:21:28.875
and forgive me if it's insulting in any way.

4799
03:21:28.875 --> 03:21:31.145
Have you considered at all that King Dwendal

4800
03:21:31.145 --> 03:21:35.045
might somehow be knowledgeable of this?

4801
03:21:36.492 --> 03:21:38.132
MATT: "Of this cult activity?"

4802
03:21:38.132 --> 03:21:41.132
TRAVIS: Yes, of this third party movement?

4803
03:21:42.395 --> 03:21:44.075
MATT: "If he's aware,

4804
03:21:44.075 --> 03:21:45.646
"and is not involved,

4805
03:21:45.646 --> 03:21:47.526
"he would have voiced this.

"hmm."

4812
03:22:03.435 --> 03:22:05.326
TRAVIS: Again, no offense intended.

4813
03:22:05.326 --> 03:22:06.159
Merely--

4814
03:22:08.145 --> 03:22:10.355
MATT: "I would need evidence for that."

4815
03:22:10.355 --> 03:22:11.813
MARISHA: Have you noticed anything different

4816
03:22:11.813 --> 03:22:13.896
with him here lately?

4817
03:22:14.887 --> 03:22:19.637
Recurring themes involving the Chained Oblivion,

4818
03:22:20.995 --> 03:22:24.865
involve manipulation, starvation--

4819
03:22:24.865 --> 03:22:25.698
LAURA: Hunger.

4820
03:22:25.698 --> 03:22:26.531
MARISHA: Hunger.

4821
03:22:26.531 --> 03:22:27.843
SAM: Is anyone on the Cerberus Assembly

4822
03:22:27.843 --> 03:22:29.431
like really hungry all the time?

4823
03:22:29.431 --> 03:22:31.673
LAURA: Or aggressive all of a sudden, like all this--

4824
03:22:31.673 --> 03:22:32.506
SAM: Or just like--

4825
03:22:32.506 --> 03:22:34.563

LAURA: Like who? Like Trent, maybe?

4831
03:22:52.032 --> 03:22:53.565
MATT: "What do you know of Trent?"

4832
03:22:53.565 --> 03:22:55.558
SAM: (quietly) Mm-mm.

4833
03:22:55.558 --> 03:22:58.369
LAURA: I don't know, just Yussa was talking about

4834
03:22:58.369 --> 03:23:00.796
some of the members and said that Trent

4835
03:23:00.796 --> 03:23:02.979
was kind of creepy is all.

4836
03:23:02.979 --> 03:23:05.969
MATT: "He is a strange one, yes.

4837
03:23:05.969 --> 03:23:07.769

TALIESIN: We do know that there are
people who cannot be trusted.

MATT: "Who?"

4841
03:23:16.688 --> 03:23:20.147

entirely sure we trust you yet.

MATT: "Then why are you here?"

"I would want some definitive proof

"or direction of which I can be of assistance."

4858
03:23:52.147 --> 03:23:54.227
TALIESIN: We would be happy to offer that,

4859
03:23:54.227 --> 03:23:56.377
we just want to make sure that...

4860
03:23:57.427 --> 03:24:00.377
if the worst is true, and that this is even more tangled

4861
03:24:00.377 --> 03:24:01.695
than it even appears to be,

4862
03:24:01.695 --> 03:24:05.489
that there's going to be no trouble

4863
03:24:05.489 --> 03:24:08.866
if it's disturbing information.

4864
03:24:08.866 --> 03:24:13.866
MATT: "(laughs) We, as the Assembly, wade deeply

4865
03:24:14.089 --> 03:24:16.777
"in disturbing information.

4866
03:24:16.777 --> 03:24:19.946

is betrayed by someone they trust.

SAM: Yes, and speaking of.

4875
03:24:41.566 --> 03:24:43.598
If there is someone in your midst

4876
03:24:43.598 --> 03:24:45.198
who is betraying you,

4877
03:24:45.198 --> 03:24:49.281
you can't just go around investing them, can you?

4878
03:24:50.822 --> 03:24:51.806
MATT: "No.

4879
03:24:51.806 --> 03:24:54.134

SAM: If we wanted to possibly assist you in that effort,

4885
03:25:10.766 --> 03:25:14.275
how best could we go about doing it?

4886
03:25:14.275 --> 03:25:15.108
MATT: "Well--"

4887
03:25:15.108 --> 03:25:19.991
MARISHA: I can tell you that the Cobalt Soul
is already assembling a case

4888
03:25:19.991 --> 03:25:21.995
to take to King Dwendal.

4889
03:25:21.995 --> 03:25:24.366
MATT: "Who is assigned to this?"

4890
03:25:24.366 --> 03:25:26.566
MARISHA: Expositor Dairon.

4891
03:25:26.566 --> 03:25:28.533
MATT: "I know of this Expositor.

4892
03:25:28.533 --> 03:25:30.086
I will reach out to them,

LAURA: The Beacon?

4898
03:25:44.047 --> 03:25:45.561
TRAVIS: Yeah, the Beacon.

4899
03:25:45.561 --> 03:25:48.922
Do you know to what means he is trying to--

4900
03:25:48.922 --> 03:25:51.401
MATT: "He believes that there is something...

4901
03:25:52.301 --> 03:25:55.134
"dangerous and unstudied, untapped,

"slightly beyond the understanding of

"the existing schools of magic."

4908
03:26:16.171 --> 03:26:17.338
LAURA: Interesting.

4909
03:26:18.273 --> 03:26:22.222
MATT: "I believe there is,
as is the case with the Assembly's,

4910

"that any sort of errant or aberrant arcane pursuits

"on the battlefield, and as a means of infiltration,

03:26:51.473 --> 03:26:53.564

03:26:54.847 --> 03:26:58.251
LAURA: Well, we happen to know

4922
03:26:58.251 --> 03:27:02.251
that Ludinus' assistant, the blonde haired guy.

4923
03:27:03.302 --> 03:27:04.135
MATT: "Vence?"

4924
03:27:04.135 --> 03:27:05.102
LAURA: Yeah.

4925
03:27:05.102 --> 03:27:10.102
He's kind of working in conjunction with the cultists.

4926
03:27:10.251 --> 03:27:11.418
MATT: "The lap dog?

4927
03:27:12.381 --> 03:27:13.214
"Him?"

4928
03:27:13.214 --> 03:27:14.802
TALIESIN: He's one of the cultists.

4929
03:27:14.802 --> 03:27:19.310
LAURA: Yeah, he was helping with the rift thingies.

4930
03:27:20.642 --> 03:27:21.494
MARISHA: In fact--

4931
03:27:21.494 --> 03:27:22.625
TALIESIN: That was--

4932
03:27:22.625 --> 03:27:26.433
MARISHA: We found this fabric swatch, linked it to him.

4933
03:27:26.433 --> 03:27:29.433
And that's also where we found that.

4934
03:27:32.707 --> 03:27:33.882
TALIESIN: It's time.

4935
03:27:33.882 --> 03:27:35.523
LIAM: One was glued to the other.

4936
03:27:37.743 --> 03:27:42.618
MARISHA: Those look like Empire robes to us.

4937
03:27:45.354 --> 03:27:47.063
MATT: "This will suffice.

4938
03:27:47.063 --> 03:27:48.674
"I will begin my investigations."

4939
03:27:48.674 --> 03:27:50.111
MARISHA: Are you going to keep that?

4940
03:27:50.111 --> 03:27:50.983
MATT: "I would have to."

4941
03:27:50.983 --> 03:27:52.223
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

4942
03:27:52.223 --> 03:27:53.095
LAURA: I saw him.

4943
03:27:53.095 --> 03:27:55.012
He was writing in a book.

4944
03:27:56.143 --> 03:27:58.335
It was a book that he kept with him.

4945
03:27:58.335 --> 03:28:00.175
MATT: "Do you know where he is now?"

4946
03:28:00.175 --> 03:28:01.008
(laughter)

4947
03:28:01.008 --> 03:28:03.758
SAM: She didn't learn that spell.
LAURA: I'll know tomorrow.

4948
03:28:06.702 --> 03:28:09.044
SAM: But if you need us to check--

4949
03:28:09.044 --> 03:28:11.079
check up on him and get more information--

4950
03:28:11.079 --> 03:28:12.347
MATT: "Please.

4951
03:28:12.347 --> 03:28:13.612
"Notify me."

4952
03:28:13.612 --> 03:28:17.268
LAURA: I'll send you a message the minute I know anything.

4953
03:28:17.268 --> 03:28:18.829
SAM: Is there anything you can give us

4954
03:28:18.829 --> 03:28:23.787
that would help us get closer to his circle

4955
03:28:27.340 --> 03:28:29.964
of assistants or employees--

4956
03:28:29.964 --> 03:28:32.916
LAURA: Yeah, maybe you can hire us as your assistant,

4957
03:28:32.916 --> 03:28:34.865
or one of us, and then

4958
03:28:34.865 --> 03:28:37.662
we'll hang out as assistants together.

4959
03:28:37.662 --> 03:28:38.837
MATT: "Let me--"

4960
03:28:38.837 --> 03:28:41.164
LAURA: Do you have assistant break rooms?

4961
03:28:41.164 --> 03:28:42.935
MATT: You see he closes his eyes,

4962
03:28:42.935 --> 03:28:46.485
the dark glare of his

4963
03:28:46.485 --> 03:28:50.455
colorless pupils vanishing,

4964
03:28:50.455 --> 03:28:53.596
and you see a faint glow from behind the eyelids.

4965
03:28:53.596 --> 03:28:55.962
He speaks out loud, you recognize this as

4966
03:28:55.962 --> 03:28:58.895
a separate flair to the Sending spell.

4967
03:29:01.375 --> 03:29:02.808
"Vence.

"Headmaster Oremid."

03:29:06.255 --> 03:29:07.564
SAM: (whispering) Don't mention us!

03:29:07.564 --> 03:29:10.378
MATT: "I understand if you're still in town,

"and I have some business."

4976
03:29:28.855 --> 03:29:30.104
SAM: He gets extra.

4977
03:29:30.104 --> 03:29:33.837
LAURA: How many words did he just say?
TRAVIS: When you don't have pupils, you can just--

4978
03:29:33.837 --> 03:29:35.994
SAM: May I ask one other strange question

4979
03:29:35.994 --> 03:29:38.324
while you wait for his response?

4980
03:29:38.324 --> 03:29:42.274
Do you have a little bowl of milk for our kitty cat?

4981
03:29:42.274 --> 03:29:43.146
LAURA: Oh, and--

4982
03:29:43.146 --> 03:29:44.975
MATT: Immediately his face goes--

4983
03:29:44.975 --> 03:29:47.225
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4984
03:29:48.186 --> 03:29:50.362
MATT: "Why didn't you say, what is this little one, what is--

4985
03:29:50.362 --> 03:29:52.053
"oh my goodness me!"

entire presentory intimidating visage

4989
03:30:00.395 --> 03:30:01.468
just crumbles.

"What is your name?"

4991
03:30:02.605 --> 03:30:04.121
LIAM: I like the idea that the whole time Frumpkin's

4992
03:30:04.121 --> 03:30:07.597
been hidden just one side of your lapel.

4993
03:30:07.597 --> 03:30:09.672
And then the head pokes out.

4994
03:30:09.672 --> 03:30:10.505
Yeah.

4995
03:30:10.505 --> 03:30:12.980
MATT: "Oh, this is a--

4996
03:30:12.980 --> 03:30:14.650
"you are a familiar!"

LAURA: What about--

4998
03:30:15.639 --> 03:30:17.383
MATT: "Whose familiar is this?"

4999

LAURA: Also Sprinkle.

5000
03:30:18.482 --> 03:30:21.509
SAM: Familiar? I mean, he's just a cat.
MATT: "Oh!"

5001
03:30:21.509 --> 03:30:22.896
SAM: He's not a magical thing.

5002

TRAVIS: Double presents!

03:30:24.087 --> 03:30:27.698
MATT: "(laughs) This is, oh, this is--"

5004
03:30:27.698 --> 03:30:30.727

"we are talking about very important things, but--"

5007
03:30:34.727 --> 03:30:36.069
(laughter)
TRAVIS: The little things in life.

5008
03:30:36.069 --> 03:30:38.310
MATT: "Oh, oh!"

5009
03:30:39.258 --> 03:30:41.402
LAURA: Yeah, Sprinkle likes to cuddle in, yeah.

5010
03:30:41.402 --> 03:30:44.519
LIAM: Remember, I told Frumpkin to be extra adorable.

5011
03:30:44.519 --> 03:30:46.899
MATT: Is just cuddling on-- you can see,

5012
03:30:46.899 --> 03:30:48.816
the shoulders go up.

5013
03:30:50.101 --> 03:30:52.034
LIAM: Kitty biscuits.

5014
03:30:52.034 --> 03:30:54.110
LAURA: Oh yeah, on the back.

5015
03:30:54.110 --> 03:30:54.943
MATT: Yeah.

5016
03:30:54.943 --> 03:30:59.119
As this is happening, his reaction stops for a moment.

5017
03:30:59.119 --> 03:31:01.570
"Vence is not in Zadash."

5018
03:31:01.570 --> 03:31:02.403
LAURA: He's not?

5019
03:31:02.403 --> 03:31:04.026
MATT: "He's in Rexxentrum,

5020
03:31:04.026 --> 03:31:07.595
"on important business for Da'leth, so--"

5021
03:31:07.595 --> 03:31:09.596
LIAM: Oh goodness. Ludinus Da'leth.

5022
03:31:09.596 --> 03:31:10.903
MARISHA: Oh.
LIAM: Mean man.

5023
03:31:10.903 --> 03:31:13.630
TALIESIN: Agents-- agents of...

5024
03:31:14.502 --> 03:31:19.502
this Angel of Irons are moving quickly towards something,

5025
03:31:19.767 --> 03:31:22.367
their plans obviously are to...

5026
03:31:23.996 --> 03:31:26.553
free this thing.

5027
03:31:26.553 --> 03:31:27.983
MATT: "What was that?"

5028
03:31:27.983 --> 03:31:30.905

5029
03:31:30.905 --> 03:31:32.225
"I know, I know.

5030
03:31:32.225 --> 03:31:34.826
"You are-- okay, if you are hungry, I'll get you--

5031
03:31:34.826 --> 03:31:36.597
"hey! (claps)

5032
03:31:36.597 --> 03:31:38.338
"Bring some--

5033
03:31:38.338 --> 03:31:41.018
"bring some from t-t-the mess,

5034
03:31:41.018 --> 03:31:44.312
"bring some of the chopped, small cubed meats, please.

5035
03:31:44.312 --> 03:31:45.318
"Thank you."

5036
03:31:45.318 --> 03:31:46.576
The guard leaves for a bit.

5037
03:31:46.576 --> 03:31:48.498
SAM: Kibble!
TRAVIS: (laughing) He's getting food.

5038
03:31:48.498 --> 03:31:50.058
MATT: "I'm sorry, but what was--"

5039
03:31:50.058 --> 03:31:53.357
TALIESIN: There's-- we do know that

5040
03:31:53.357 --> 03:31:56.535
their plans are in motion, any leads that we could have

5041
03:31:56.535 --> 03:32:01.415
on stopping them before they release this ancient void

5042
03:32:01.415 --> 03:32:03.162
would be--
MATT: "Of course."

5043
03:32:03.162 --> 03:32:04.870
TALIESIN: Helpful?

5044
03:32:04.870 --> 03:32:06.787
MATT: "I would be-- oh!

5045
03:32:07.775 --> 03:32:09.487
"This is such a tiny weasel."

5046
03:32:09.487 --> 03:32:11.826
LAURA: I know, he's just the best, isn't he?

5047
03:32:11.826 --> 03:32:12.725
MATT: "This is adorable!

5048
03:32:12.725 --> 03:32:14.927
"A bit gaunt, but he's beautiful."

5049
03:32:14.927 --> 03:32:17.896
LAURA: Well, you know, he's an adventurer, so he's lithe.

5050
03:32:17.896 --> 03:32:19.629
MATT: "You've been around, haven't you?

5051
03:32:19.629 --> 03:32:21.529
TALIESIN: Hasn't been fed in three or four weeks.
LAURA: Shush shush shush.

5052
03:32:21.529 --> 03:32:22.941
MATT: It bites his finger,

5053
03:32:22.941 --> 03:32:24.768
but his finger's hard,

5054
03:32:24.768 --> 03:32:28.839
and just like, "Oh, (adoring mumbling).

5055
03:32:28.839 --> 03:32:32.364
"I will go ahead and begin to reach out to my contacts,

5056
03:32:34.367 --> 03:32:36.437
"perhaps I may have to make a journey to Rexxentrum

5057
03:32:36.437 --> 03:32:37.839
"myself when the time comes,

5058
03:32:37.839 --> 03:32:40.557
"but I need to ensure that I do not raise any suspicion

5059
03:32:40.557 --> 03:32:43.210
"or do anything to tip them off--"

5060
03:32:43.210 --> 03:32:46.355
SAM: I'm just saying, we could go for you, if you want.

5061
03:32:46.355 --> 03:32:47.363
MATT: "Well, of course.

5062
03:32:47.363 --> 03:32:49.679
"But I feel like we have different avenues we can purs--

5063
03:32:49.679 --> 03:32:51.661
"I know, I know.

5064
03:32:51.661 --> 03:32:55.128
"Different avenues we can pursue simultaneously.

5065
03:32:57.061 --> 03:33:00.486
"Do-- is there anything else you need?"

5066
03:33:01.328 --> 03:33:02.568
MARISHA: Man, I'm so distracted.

5067
03:33:02.568 --> 03:33:04.141
LAURA: I know, it's really cute!

5068
03:33:04.141 --> 03:33:04.974
MARISHA: So cute.

5069
03:33:07.301 --> 03:33:12.279
SAM: This is productive, but what are the other avenues

5070
03:33:12.279 --> 03:33:13.807
that we can pursue right now?

5071
03:33:13.807 --> 03:33:15.250
TRAVIS: We did ask for something that would perhaps

5072
03:33:15.250 --> 03:33:17.861
let us move with a bit more ease, right?

5073
03:33:17.861 --> 03:33:20.668
Something perhaps, a letter or, if it's more important

5074
03:33:20.668 --> 03:33:22.301
for us not to be affiliated with you,

5075
03:33:22.301 --> 03:33:23.821
if you want us to move with some autonomy,

5076
03:33:23.821 --> 03:33:25.541
but independence--

5077
03:33:25.541 --> 03:33:27.039
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

5078
03:33:27.039 --> 03:33:28.221
LAURA: Guidance.

5079
03:33:28.221 --> 03:33:29.054
TRAVIS: Okay.

5080
03:33:29.054 --> 03:33:30.681
TALIESIN: Well, casting a spell--

5081
03:33:30.681 --> 03:33:32.847
LAURA: Oh, is that bad?

5082
03:33:32.847 --> 03:33:34.218
MATT: Guidance isn't just a, (pop)

5083
03:33:34.218 --> 03:33:36.098
it's like a-- in front of a--

5084
03:33:36.098 --> 03:33:38.331
(laughter)

5085
03:33:38.331 --> 03:33:40.346
TRAVIS: It's okay, it's okay.

5086
03:33:40.346 --> 03:33:42.013
Just because I don't--

5087
03:33:42.954 --> 03:33:44.546
21.

5088
03:33:44.546 --> 03:33:45.494
Persuasion?

5089
03:33:45.494 --> 03:33:47.077
MATT: Persuasion check.
TRAVIS: 21.

5090
03:33:50.045 --> 03:33:52.464
MATT: He reaches back into the inside of the robes,

5091
03:33:52.464 --> 03:33:57.055
and pulls out a pin of some kind.

5092
03:33:57.055 --> 03:34:00.154
You can see the shape of it, it's these--

5093
03:34:00.154 --> 03:34:02.775
it looks like this with a series of small spires in it,

5094
03:34:02.775 --> 03:34:06.344
almost, imagine like a curved comb with eight spires

5095
03:34:06.344 --> 03:34:08.986
that all slowly get smaller towards the center.

5096
03:34:08.986 --> 03:34:10.563
Above it, you can see three diamonds

5097
03:34:10.563 --> 03:34:12.045
that face each other, you recognize this

5098
03:34:12.045 --> 03:34:15.114
as the symbol of the Cerberus Assembly.

5099
03:34:15.114 --> 03:34:16.154
The three diamonds are for

5100
03:34:16.154 --> 03:34:17.535
the three heads of the Cerberus,

5101
03:34:17.535 --> 03:34:21.106
and the eight being the Candles of Rexxentrum.

5102
03:34:21.106 --> 03:34:22.906
TRAVIS: That's fucking crazy dope.

5103
03:34:22.906 --> 03:34:25.033
MATT: Hands it to you.

5104
03:34:25.033 --> 03:34:26.775
SAM: Maybe don't put it in the same pocket

5105
03:34:26.775 --> 03:34:28.546
as the other one that we have--

5106
03:34:28.546 --> 03:34:29.433
(laughter)

5107
03:34:29.433 --> 03:34:31.474
LAURA: I accidentally pull-- oh shit, wrong one.

5108
03:34:31.474 --> 03:34:34.016
TALIESIN: If we get the Disney pin trader belt,
it'll be fine.

5109
03:34:34.016 --> 03:34:35.403
(laughter)

5110
03:34:35.403 --> 03:34:36.713
MARISHA: Let us-- fuck.

5111
03:34:36.713 --> 03:34:38.162
Let us in!

5112
03:34:38.162 --> 03:34:39.354
MATT: He goes ahead and waves his hand

5113
03:34:39.354 --> 03:34:41.005
and you can see this faint glow

5114
03:34:41.005 --> 03:34:43.305
solidify in the front of it,

5115
03:34:43.305 --> 03:34:45.034
and a symbol flashes for a second

5116
03:34:45.034 --> 03:34:46.514
and then vanishes.

5117
03:34:46.514 --> 03:34:48.375
"I've marked that with my signature.

5118
03:34:48.375 --> 03:34:51.285
"If any members of the Assembly give you trouble,

5119
03:34:51.285 --> 03:34:54.826
"present that and it should at least lend a bit credibility,

03:34:54.826 --> 03:34:59.313
"but once again, even my influence limitations

03:34:59.313 --> 03:35:02.396
"should you do anything untoward or...

"Extreme.

"You are on your own."

5124
03:35:08.535 --> 03:35:09.368
SAM: Not us.

5125
03:35:09.368 --> 03:35:10.405
No, we're fine.

5126
03:35:10.405 --> 03:35:11.512
MARISHA: We're very even keeled.

5127
03:35:11.512 --> 03:35:13.981
SAM: Speaking of the members of the Assembly,

5128
03:35:13.981 --> 03:35:17.005
in Rexxentrum, if we make our way up there,

5129
03:35:17.005 --> 03:35:19.965
are there any members that you, without a doubt

5130
03:35:19.965 --> 03:35:21.215
and all of your...

5131
03:35:22.885 --> 03:35:25.975
experience points to trusting entirely

5132
03:35:25.975 --> 03:35:28.194
and completely with your life--

5133
03:35:28.194 --> 03:35:29.303
MATT: "No."

5134
03:35:29.303 --> 03:35:30.814
SAM: Wow.

5135
03:35:30.814 --> 03:35:32.674
These are your co-workers.

5136
03:35:32.674 --> 03:35:34.325
That's a problem.

5137
03:35:34.325 --> 03:35:36.714
You should have an HR department or something.

5138
03:35:36.714 --> 03:35:38.297
MATT: "While there is a...

5139
03:35:40.605 --> 03:35:43.688
"a spectrum of trustworthiness within,

5140
03:35:45.623 --> 03:35:49.203

"It is for the good of society.

"The future of the Empire.

"And we, in turn, offer a check

"to the crown."

5148
03:36:10.725 --> 03:36:12.103
MARISHA: Just like the Cobalt Soul.

5149
03:36:12.103 --> 03:36:12.975
SAM: Mm-hmm.

5150
03:36:12.975 --> 03:36:14.953
MARISHA: Right?
LAURA: Makes sense, yeah.

5151
03:36:14.953 --> 03:36:17.034
TRAVIS: Just for clarity, do you want us to avoid

5152
03:36:17.034 --> 03:36:19.181
using your name if at all possible?

5153
03:36:20.623 --> 03:36:23.205
MATT: "If at all possible, yes.

5154
03:36:23.205 --> 03:36:25.114
"But understand,

5155
03:36:25.114 --> 03:36:28.395
"there are many enemies of the Empire in Exandria.

"And many of these enemies rush towards the secrets,

"That requires strange bedfellows at times."

TRAVIS: I think we understand that within our own group.

MATT: "(sighs) Well.

5165

"Time is of the essence.

TRAVIS: One last thing, do you happen to know

5168
03:37:06.746 --> 03:37:09.255
any of the members of the Tal'Dorei Council?

5169

TRAVIS: Very well.

5172

MARISHA: Do you have names?

5173
03:37:16.449 --> 03:37:18.285
We're just curious, you know.

5174

MATT: "What does this have to do--"

MARISHA: We try to keep up with global politics.

SAM: Global politics.
MARISHA: We feel like it's important.

5177
03:37:23.717 --> 03:37:25.662
TRAVIS: Yussa knew of Allura Vysoren,

5178
03:37:25.662 --> 03:37:26.862
and we were just curious.

5179
03:37:26.862 --> 03:37:29.135
MATT: "I've heard of Allura,
but I have not met her personally."

5180
03:37:29.135 --> 03:37:30.863
SAM: Just heard of Allura?

5181

03:37:33.714 --> 03:37:35.695
A yearly photo with, you know.

5184
03:37:35.695 --> 03:37:38.238
LIAM: Christmas card, or...

5185
03:37:38.238 --> 03:37:39.295
TRAVIS: Very well.

5186
03:37:39.295 --> 03:37:40.445
We must be off.

5187
03:37:40.445 --> 03:37:42.265
(laughter)

5188
03:37:42.265 --> 03:37:43.773
MATT: You motherfuckers.

5189

(laughter)

5190
03:37:44.710 --> 03:37:45.995
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you, Travis.

5191
03:37:45.995 --> 03:37:48.245
(laughter)

5192
03:37:51.223 --> 03:37:53.583
TALIESIN: Right, let's meet back up.

5193
03:37:53.583 --> 03:37:55.773
MATT: As you guys are-- stand up,

5194
03:37:55.773 --> 03:37:58.794
Oremid escorts you out, and as you come to the steps

5195
03:37:58.794 --> 03:38:00.613
of the Halls of Erudition,

5196
03:38:00.613 --> 03:38:02.533
there's that moment of like,

5197
03:38:02.533 --> 03:38:04.714
"Very good luck, and please, once again,

03:38:12.063 --> 03:38:15.055
"I can continue the work you could not finish."

5203
03:38:16.805 --> 03:38:19.463
SAM: Can we have the pets back, please?

5204
03:38:19.463 --> 03:38:20.654
I mean...

5205
03:38:21.696 --> 03:38:23.883
TRAVIS: Oh no!
MATT: "I suppose."

5206
03:38:23.883 --> 03:38:25.456
TALIESIN: We'll bring them back.

5207
03:38:25.456 --> 03:38:27.114
MATT: "(chittering) Oh!"

5208
03:38:27.114 --> 03:38:27.947
LAURA: Thank you.

5209
03:38:27.947 --> 03:38:30.253
Can I insight check Sprinkle and see if

5210
03:38:30.253 --> 03:38:33.565
he wants to stay with Hass more than he likes me?

5211
03:38:33.565 --> 03:38:35.143
(laughter)

5212
03:38:35.143 --> 03:38:39.063
MATT: Sure, make an insight check.

5213
03:38:39.063 --> 03:38:41.063
TRAVIS: I mean, he does smell like earth.

5214
03:38:41.943 --> 03:38:43.223
LAURA: 21!

5215
03:38:43.223 --> 03:38:44.886
MATT: 21.

5216
03:38:44.886 --> 03:38:46.531
I mean, Sprinkle comes back to you--

5217
03:38:46.531 --> 03:38:47.364
LAURA: Okay.

5218
03:38:47.364 --> 03:38:48.770
MATT: Happy as it was before, it seemed to have enjoyed

5219
03:38:48.770 --> 03:38:51.016
the brief change of scenery, but--

5220
03:38:51.016 --> 03:38:51.849
LAURA: Don't!

5221
03:38:53.861 --> 03:38:55.794
MATT: Gently puts Frumpkin down and skritches

5222
03:38:55.794 --> 03:38:58.583
his head a little more, and goes like,

5223
03:38:58.583 --> 03:39:01.493
"Feel free to bring them back anytime.

5224
03:39:01.493 --> 03:39:03.303
"You know where to find me, usually."

5225
03:39:03.303 --> 03:39:05.695
TRAVIS: We're going to come back,
he's going to have fucking cat toys.

5226
03:39:05.695 --> 03:39:07.394
MARISHA: Yeah!

5227
03:39:07.394 --> 03:39:10.533
LAURA: Do you know what weasels like to sleep in?

5228
03:39:10.533 --> 03:39:12.623
MATT: "Oh, there are a number of things.

5229
03:39:12.623 --> 03:39:14.890
"As a keeper, you can have a small pouch

5230
03:39:14.890 --> 03:39:17.101
"that you keep over your shoulder they can curl up inside

5231
03:39:17.101 --> 03:39:19.074
"and sleep and keep themselves warm,

5232
03:39:19.074 --> 03:39:22.442
"otherwise, blankets, steamed so there's a slight

5233
03:39:22.442 --> 03:39:24.693
"bit of dampness, but still warmed.

5234
03:39:24.693 --> 03:39:27.234
"Tends to be a very, very calming experience

5235
03:39:27.234 --> 03:39:28.273
"for most weasels."

5236
03:39:28.273 --> 03:39:29.581
LAURA: Oh, that's nice!

5237
03:39:29.581 --> 03:39:33.679
MATT: "Otherwise, shredded bits of parchment,

5238
03:39:33.679 --> 03:39:37.069
"loose, natural cotton, they are able to create

5239
03:39:37.069 --> 03:39:39.194
"a little burrow for themselves--"

5240
03:39:39.194 --> 03:39:40.679
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5241
03:39:40.679 --> 03:39:43.279
What about little special treats?

5242
03:39:43.279 --> 03:39:44.304
MATT: "Oh."

5243
03:39:44.304 --> 03:39:46.701
LAURA: I've been giving him candy, I don't know if that's--

5244
03:39:46.701 --> 03:39:48.288
MATT: "I would not recommend candy."
LAURA: Not candy?

5245
03:39:48.288 --> 03:39:50.525
MATT: "It will cause the rest of their teeth to rot out."

5246
03:39:50.525 --> 03:39:51.358
LAURA: Oh.

5247
03:39:51.358 --> 03:39:52.749
MATT: And leans forward and opens the mouth.

5248
03:39:52.749 --> 03:39:55.658
"Yeah, there's all this sort of blackness to the gums."

5249
03:39:55.658 --> 03:39:56.862
LAURA: Oh, Sprinkle!

5250
03:39:56.862 --> 03:40:00.806
MATT: "I would recommend perhaps tanned meats,

5251
03:40:00.806 --> 03:40:03.479
"you know, dried jerkies, things to help clean the teeth

5252
03:40:03.479 --> 03:40:05.090
"as it's chewed as well."

5253
03:40:05.090 --> 03:40:06.290
LAURA: What about sweets.

5254
03:40:06.290 --> 03:40:10.369
MATT: "Dried flowers as well bits of sugar, maybe.

5255
03:40:10.369 --> 03:40:12.528
"But try to keep it minimal."

5256
03:40:12.528 --> 03:40:13.842
LAURA: Okay.

5257
03:40:15.315 --> 03:40:17.341
MARISHA: He has been looking a little chunky.

5258
03:40:17.341 --> 03:40:18.174
LAURA: No, he's--

5259
03:40:18.174 --> 03:40:19.261
MARISHA: Just a little.

5260
03:40:19.261 --> 03:40:21.850
LAURA: He's not chunky at all, he's super skinny.

5261
03:40:21.850 --> 03:40:23.409
MATT: Super skinny.

5262
03:40:23.409 --> 03:40:26.150
LAURA: He's like super skinny and everyone's like--

5263
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:31.075
(laughter)

5264
03:40:33.617 --> 03:40:35.322
TALIESIN: That image is burned into my head!

5265
03:40:35.322 --> 03:40:36.373
Thank you!

5266
03:40:36.373 --> 03:40:37.951
LIAM: The little rat mammal in Ice Age.

5267
03:40:37.951 --> 03:40:39.867
TRAVIS: Yes!
MATT: Yep!

5268
03:40:39.867 --> 03:40:41.283
Straight up.

5269
03:40:41.283 --> 03:40:43.282
(laughter)

5270
03:40:43.282 --> 03:40:44.213
LAURA: All right, well.

5271
03:40:44.213 --> 03:40:45.373
(laughter)

5272
03:40:45.373 --> 03:40:47.528
I've got-- you know, that's good to know, thank you.

5273
03:40:47.528 --> 03:40:49.502
MATT: "Of course, of course.

5274
03:40:49.502 --> 03:40:51.030
"Good luck!

5275
03:40:51.030 --> 03:40:51.863
"Good bye!"

5276
03:40:53.583 --> 03:40:55.482
SAM: Do you think with his-- bye!

5277
03:40:55.482 --> 03:40:58.754
Do you think with his earth powers

5278
03:40:58.754 --> 03:41:02.342
he can just change a litterbox, just with his mind?

5279
03:41:02.342 --> 03:41:03.175
LAURA: Probably.

5280
03:41:03.175 --> 03:41:04.008
SAM: Amazing.

5281
03:41:04.008 --> 03:41:04.841
LAURA: So easy.

5282
03:41:04.841 --> 03:41:05.674
MARISHA: Oh, I pick up Frumpkin.

5283
03:41:05.674 --> 03:41:06.674
MATT: Okay.

5284
03:41:06.674 --> 03:41:08.033
MARISHA: I don't forget Frumpkin.

5285
03:41:08.033 --> 03:41:09.222
MATT: Mmkay.

5286
03:41:09.222 --> 03:41:10.792
You finished your research,

5287
03:41:10.792 --> 03:41:12.223
where are you guys meeting up?

5288
03:41:12.223 --> 03:41:13.451
SAM: We said we were going to meet at--

5289
03:41:13.451 --> 03:41:14.773
TALIESIN: At The Invulnerable Vagrant.

5290
03:41:14.773 --> 03:41:15.889
SAM: Is that where we said?

5291
03:41:15.889 --> 03:41:18.053
TALIESIN: Yeah, we said we were going to meet at Pumat's.

5292
03:41:18.053 --> 03:41:19.373
TRAVIS: Fucking awesome!

5293
03:41:19.373 --> 03:41:20.206
MATT: All right.

5294
03:41:20.206 --> 03:41:21.554
SAM: (laughs)

5295
03:41:21.554 --> 03:41:23.224
MATT: You guys make your way back to the Pentamarket

5296
03:41:23.224 --> 03:41:26.453
to the familiar smells of various, you know, pastries

5297
03:41:26.453 --> 03:41:27.805
and cooked meats and foods,

5298
03:41:27.805 --> 03:41:32.762
along with the smell of burning wood,

5299
03:41:32.762 --> 03:41:34.633
there's the blacksmithy in the forge itself

5300
03:41:34.633 --> 03:41:37.055
billowing out its own black smoke.

5301
03:41:37.055 --> 03:41:40.223
It's very nostalgic to wander back into the Pentamarket

5302
03:41:40.223 --> 03:41:42.143
after the times you had spent here together

5303
03:41:42.143 --> 03:41:44.341
so early in your adventures.

5304
03:41:44.341 --> 03:41:47.863
Eventually, you come upon the familiar

5305
03:41:47.863 --> 03:41:50.363
green and gold wooden exterior

5306
03:41:51.543 --> 03:41:52.943
of The Invulnerable Vagrant.

5307
03:41:52.943 --> 03:41:54.794
MARISHA: Wow.

5308
03:41:54.794 --> 03:41:55.853
It's been a while.

5309
03:41:55.853 --> 03:41:57.686
TRAVIS: It's been a hot moment.
LAURA and LIAM: ♪ It's been a while! ♪

5310
03:41:57.686 --> 03:41:59.783
SAM: Okay, we're about to go in there.

5311
03:41:59.783 --> 03:42:02.114
We have a lot of money.

5312
03:42:02.114 --> 03:42:03.214
TRAVIS: Well, some of us do,

5313
03:42:03.214 --> 03:42:05.085
some of us went out and got tattoos.

5314
03:42:05.085 --> 03:42:06.436
LAURA: Really badass tattoos.

5315
03:42:06.436 --> 03:42:07.269
TRAVIS: Yep.

5316
03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:09.172
MARISHA: Super stoked about it.
LAURA: Look at, we shimmer!

5317
03:42:09.172 --> 03:42:10.005
I shimmer.

5318
03:42:10.005 --> 03:42:11.103
MARISHA: Look at that, look at that.

5319
03:42:11.103 --> 03:42:12.805
LAURA: Look at this, the shoulder shimmering,

5320
03:42:12.805 --> 03:42:14.525
that's diamond dust in me.

5321
03:42:14.525 --> 03:42:15.692
TRAVIS: Is that pus?

5322
03:42:17.223 --> 03:42:18.733
LAURA: Oh, it is pus!

5323
03:42:18.733 --> 03:42:19.841
Oh god!

5324
03:42:20.685 --> 03:42:21.594
SAM: Just clean it up.

5325
03:42:21.594 --> 03:42:22.828
TRAVIS: Aquaphor.

5326
03:42:25.612 --> 03:42:26.670
MATT: You guys enter?

5327
03:42:26.670 --> 03:42:28.094
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Is Caleb there?

5328
03:42:28.094 --> 03:42:29.244
LIAM: Yeah, I caught up.

5329
03:42:29.244 --> 03:42:31.284
MARISHA: Here, here's your cat.

5330
03:42:31.284 --> 03:42:32.542
Yeah.
LIAM: Is he okay?

5331
03:42:32.542 --> 03:42:34.904
TRAVIS: Yes.
MARISHA: Yeah, look at him, he's fine!

5332
03:42:34.904 --> 03:42:36.746
SAM: We tell Caleb everything that we learned.

5333
03:42:36.746 --> 03:42:39.778
LIAM: Frumpkin visually shows me everything.

5334
03:42:39.778 --> 03:42:41.480
TRAVIS: Does it work like that?

5335
03:42:41.480 --> 03:42:43.158
LIAM: Yeah. Telepathic link, man.

5336
03:42:43.158 --> 03:42:43.991
TRAVIS: Fuck!

5337
03:42:43.991 --> 03:42:44.824
LAURA: That's cool.

5338
03:42:44.824 --> 03:42:46.368
TRAVIS: It's like a camcorder in a cat!

5339
03:42:46.368 --> 03:42:48.525
TALIESIN: It's like a little USB cat.

5340
03:42:48.525 --> 03:42:50.437
(laughter)

5341
03:42:50.437 --> 03:42:53.385
MATT: You enter the warm chamber,

5342
03:42:53.385 --> 03:42:56.106
the lanterns themselves still hanging,

5343
03:42:56.106 --> 03:42:59.547
the lights flickering in the nice

5344
03:42:59.547 --> 03:43:01.802
dark green interior

5345
03:43:01.802 --> 03:43:04.346
with these green velvet curtains

5346
03:43:04.346 --> 03:43:06.866
that go over the windows to each side,

5347
03:43:06.866 --> 03:43:10.738
the little, the lantern light giving this warm feel.

5348
03:43:10.738 --> 03:43:13.655
You can see the tables set out with

5349
03:43:14.646 --> 03:43:15.938
a handful of things on them,

5350
03:43:15.938 --> 03:43:18.472
it's sparse in here.

5351
03:43:18.472 --> 03:43:20.717
SAM: Well, wartime, wartime.

5352
03:43:20.717 --> 03:43:24.797
MATT: You step inside, the door closes behind you,

5353
03:43:24.797 --> 03:43:29.487
there, you can see there's one familiar face.

5354
03:43:29.487 --> 03:43:32.397
Pumat sitting at the counter,

5355
03:43:32.397 --> 03:43:33.786
and is currently in the process,

5356
03:43:33.786 --> 03:43:35.517
you can see he has a band across the forehead

5357
03:43:35.517 --> 03:43:36.677
that's keeping the hair

5358
03:43:36.677 --> 03:43:39.017
out of the front of his eyes, and is in the process,

5359
03:43:39.017 --> 03:43:40.447
with his tongue sticking out of his mouth,

5360
03:43:40.447 --> 03:43:42.487
of writing down on a stack of papers,

5361
03:43:42.487 --> 03:43:44.247
before looking up and going,

5362
03:43:44.247 --> 03:43:45.430
"Oh, hey there!"
SAM: Hey!

5363
03:43:45.430 --> 03:43:47.874
MATT: "Oh, that's some familiar faces I haven't seen here

5364
03:43:47.874 --> 03:43:49.124
"in a long time.

03:43:50.466 --> 03:43:53.666

03:43:54.499 --> 03:43:55.332
Oh well--

TALIESIN: We've been all over.
SAM: For business.

5375
03:44:09.372 --> 03:44:10.213
MARISHA: Work stuff, mainly.

5376
03:44:10.213 --> 03:44:13.389
LAURA: Oh hey, did you finish those bracers?

5377
03:44:13.389 --> 03:44:14.222
SAM: What?

5378
03:44:14.222 --> 03:44:15.895
MATT: "Which bracers are you talking about?

5379
03:44:15.895 --> 03:44:17.141
"I'll look through the paperwork, here--"

5380
03:44:17.141 --> 03:44:18.786
SAM: I think we had them made somewhere else.

5381
03:44:18.786 --> 03:44:20.677
TRAVIS: That was in Xhorhas.

5382
03:44:20.677 --> 03:44:22.210
SAM: Was it?
MATT: "Do you have a receipt, perhaps,

5383
03:44:22.210 --> 03:44:23.845
"or an order form?"

5384
03:44:23.845 --> 03:44:25.392
SAM: Claim ticket?

5385
03:44:25.392 --> 03:44:27.760
MATT: "It's sort of a pickup here?"

5386
03:44:27.760 --> 03:44:29.498
TRAVIS: That big--

5387
03:44:29.498 --> 03:44:32.350
LAURA: Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.
I just knew that she got some. Sorry.

5388
03:44:32.350 --> 03:44:35.303
MATT: "Well here, let me get, Pumat!

5389
03:44:35.303 --> 03:44:37.773
"Pumat, you got some returning customers here

5390
03:44:37.773 --> 03:44:39.442
"I haven't seen in a while.

5391
03:44:39.442 --> 03:44:44.353
"Here, I'll just take this work upstairs in my room here."

5392
03:44:44.353 --> 03:44:45.565
TRAVIS: Everything been okay?

5393
03:44:45.565 --> 03:44:47.671
It looks like you might have been robbed?

5394
03:44:47.671 --> 03:44:48.815
It's very empty in here.

5395
03:44:48.815 --> 03:44:51.601
MATT: "Oh no, it's just," at that point,

5396
03:44:51.601 --> 03:44:53.285
the curtain comes past, and you can see

5397
03:44:53.285 --> 03:44:56.015
the familiar face of Pumat Prime,

5398
03:44:56.015 --> 03:44:58.649
sweat on the forehead, goggles in front of the eyes

5399
03:44:58.649 --> 03:45:01.020
with the long, protracted lens in the front,

5400
03:45:01.020 --> 03:45:03.656
wearing leather apron over the rest, and he goes,

5401
03:45:03.656 --> 03:45:07.346
"Yeah, we've been just running the clock year round.

5402
03:45:07.346 --> 03:45:09.415
"The Assembly had a lot of orders coming in over here

5403
03:45:09.415 --> 03:45:11.746
"the past few months, and it just, you know,

5404
03:45:11.746 --> 03:45:14.425
"has been less of a, less of a shop

5405
03:45:14.425 --> 03:45:17.375
"as much as it's been sort of an aid for the war effort.

5406
03:45:17.375 --> 03:45:18.944
"You know, it's trying to--"

5407
03:45:18.944 --> 03:45:20.047
LIAM: -- to the front?

5408
03:45:20.047 --> 03:45:20.916
MATT: "What's that, sorry?"

5409
03:45:20.916 --> 03:45:22.455
LIAM: Sending supplies to the front, I said.

5410
03:45:22.455 --> 03:45:24.335
MATT: "Oh yeah, trying to keep our soldiers alive,

5411
03:45:24.335 --> 03:45:25.957
"and, you know.

5412
03:45:25.957 --> 03:45:27.766
"Best we can at least, there's only so many of us

5413
03:45:27.766 --> 03:45:30.487
"to go around. (laughs)

5414
03:45:30.487 --> 03:45:31.647
"Where are the other two guys?"

5415
03:45:31.647 --> 03:45:32.583
He goes, "Oh, they're napping."

5416
03:45:32.583 --> 03:45:35.517
He's like, "Ah, they earned it, it's fine.

5417
03:45:35.517 --> 03:45:37.517
"Anyway, yeah, it's just,

5418
03:45:38.374 --> 03:45:39.914
"sorry we're a little low.

5419
03:45:39.914 --> 03:45:41.954
"What you looking for, what can I help you with?"

5420
03:45:41.954 --> 03:45:43.926
TRAVIS: Well, we've come with quite a bit of coin to spend.

5421
03:45:43.926 --> 03:45:45.274
Actually we were quite looking back

5422
03:45:45.274 --> 03:45:47.455
to returning to your place of business.

5423
03:45:47.455 --> 03:45:51.765
Any high value items that perhaps--

5424
03:45:51.765 --> 03:45:53.753
TALIESIN: Unusual or otherwise.

5425
03:45:53.753 --> 03:45:54.586
MATT: "Oh well--"

5426
03:45:54.586 --> 03:45:56.603
TRAVIS: Just so you know, your previous items

5427
03:45:56.603 --> 03:45:59.165
have gone to good use. I'll summon the sword

5428
03:45:59.165 --> 03:46:01.774
and show the hilt of--

5429
03:46:01.774 --> 03:46:03.066
MATT: "Oh!"
TALIESIN: We had it repaired.

5430
03:46:03.066 --> 03:46:05.912
MATT: "Well, that's a sight for
some flipping eyes right there!

5431
03:46:05.912 --> 03:46:07.735
"Let me take a look at that thing!

5432
03:46:07.735 --> 03:46:10.415
"(laughs)

5433
03:46:10.415 --> 03:46:13.525
"Ah, I couldn't make this myself, this is,

5434
03:46:13.525 --> 03:46:15.383
"this is some mighty fine craftsmanship."

5435
03:46:15.383 --> 03:46:17.725
TRAVIS: It all started here at The Invulnerable Vagrant.

5436
03:46:17.725 --> 03:46:21.254
MATT: "Well, that's just, that's just beautiful."

5437
03:46:21.254 --> 03:46:23.696
(laughter)

5438
03:46:23.696 --> 03:46:25.704
"I'm taken aback, I'm going to get a little

5439
03:46:25.704 --> 03:46:29.261
"teary eyed here. I'm just (sniffs) proud."

5440
03:46:29.261 --> 03:46:30.621
Puts the goggles up a bit.

5441
03:46:30.621 --> 03:46:32.343
(laughter)

5442
03:46:32.343 --> 03:46:35.233
"Wow, if you're ever looking to sell that, let me know."

5443
03:46:35.233 --> 03:46:36.982
TRAVIS: I will keep that in mind.

5444
03:46:36.982 --> 03:46:38.274
MATT: "All righty.

5445
03:46:38.274 --> 03:46:39.812
"Um.

5446
03:46:39.812 --> 03:46:42.867
"Hey, you guys are, you guys are still doing

5447
03:46:42.867 --> 03:46:44.815
"the adventuring thing, right?"

5448
03:46:44.815 --> 03:46:47.417
TALIESIN: Quite a bit.
SAM: Yes, yes.

5449
03:46:47.417 --> 03:46:51.217
MATT: "I got a-- quite the problem solvers.

5450
03:46:52.202 --> 03:46:53.826
"Done a few things, right, around here?"

5451
03:46:53.826 --> 03:46:54.872
SAM: Sure, sure.

5452
03:46:54.872 --> 03:46:55.884
TRAVIS: Quite first.

5453
03:46:55.884 --> 03:46:58.954
MATT: "Well, would you be able to help me with something,

5454
03:46:58.954 --> 03:46:59.787
"if you don't mind?"

5455
03:46:59.787 --> 03:47:01.245
SAM: Help you, of course, yeah!

5456
03:47:01.245 --> 03:47:02.104
LAURA: What do you want--

5457
03:47:02.104 --> 03:47:05.024
MATT: "I got gold, I got discounts for, you know,

5458
03:47:05.024 --> 03:47:07.974
"repeat customers especially, and I,

5459
03:47:07.974 --> 03:47:12.974
"you know, do this whole bag up for a favor, just like that.

5460
03:47:13.311 --> 03:47:15.362
"Here, I've been working on a new enchant for months,

5461
03:47:15.362 --> 03:47:17.890
"and I finally got most of the way into finishing it,

5462
03:47:17.890 --> 03:47:20.392
"but I kind of miscounted my materials,

5463
03:47:20.392 --> 03:47:23.950
"and had to halt my progress."

5464
03:47:23.950 --> 03:47:24.783
LAURA: Okay.

5465
03:47:24.783 --> 03:47:26.350
LIAM: What are you in need of?

5466
03:47:26.350 --> 03:47:31.350
MATT: "Well, I need an additional vial
of Swavain basilisk oil.

"My usual contact has been delayed up north,

"Can't tell you, sort of, you know, privileged

5471
03:47:42.831 --> 03:47:44.529
"due to the client, you understand."

5472
03:47:44.529 --> 03:47:45.362
LAURA: Totally.

5473
03:47:46.379 --> 03:47:49.040
MATT: "But I'd be happy to pay, oh,"

5474
03:47:49.040 --> 03:47:50.639
looks at the paperwork here.

5475
03:47:50.639 --> 03:47:53.139
"about 5,700 gold for the vial."

5476
03:47:55.179 --> 03:47:56.490
SAM: 5,700 gold?

5477
03:47:56.490 --> 03:47:58.090
MATT: "Yeah."
SAM: Wow.

5478
03:47:58.090 --> 03:48:00.005
TRAVIS: Swavain basilisk oil.
MATT: "Yeah."

5479
03:48:00.005 --> 03:48:01.690
LAURA: Where would we find that?

5480
03:48:01.690 --> 03:48:03.752
MATT: "Well, you'd probably find it

5481
03:48:03.752 --> 03:48:06.131
"in the Swavain Islands, probably."

5482
03:48:06.131 --> 03:48:07.039
SAM: Oh.

5483
03:48:07.039 --> 03:48:08.293
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

5484
03:48:08.293 --> 03:48:09.426
SAM: Where is that?
LAURA: Those islands.

5485
03:48:09.426 --> 03:48:10.751
SAM: Get out those maps.

5486
03:48:10.751 --> 03:48:12.086
Well, wait, we could just ask him.

5487
03:48:12.086 --> 03:48:13.216
Where are those?

5488
03:48:13.216 --> 03:48:17.266
MATT: "They're south of the Menagerie Coast,

5489
03:48:17.266 --> 03:48:19.593
"go along the southern base of Wildemount,

"you'd find them usually coastal."

03:48:22.301 --> 03:48:25.184
LAURA: Where's that in regards to Rumblecusp?

5492
03:48:25.184 --> 03:48:26.504
TRAVIS: The Swavain Islands?

5493
03:48:26.504 --> 03:48:28.496
Oh shit, right next to them.

5494
03:48:28.496 --> 03:48:30.344
LAURA: Sweet, sweet.

5495
03:48:30.344 --> 03:48:31.177
MARISHA: Yeah.

5496
03:48:31.177 --> 03:48:32.073
How soon do you need this, Pumat?

5497
03:48:32.073 --> 03:48:32.984
MATT: "Oh, I mean, you know.

5498
03:48:32.984 --> 03:48:34.686
"Sooner the better, but it's not a huge push,

03:48:34.686 --> 03:48:37.064
"I just, preferably in the next couple months or so."

5500
03:48:37.064 --> 03:48:39.493
TALIESIN: We may be making our
way that direction pretty soon,

5501
03:48:39.493 --> 03:48:40.586
so that works out well.

5502
03:48:40.586 --> 03:48:42.826
LAURA: What is the date?

5503
03:48:42.826 --> 03:48:45.535
Today, we've been out of commission for a bit,

5504
03:48:45.535 --> 03:48:47.486
I don't know the exact day.

5505
03:48:47.486 --> 03:48:49.602
MATT: Let me get it from CritRoleStats.

5506
03:48:49.602 --> 03:48:52.254
(laughter)

5507
03:48:52.254 --> 03:48:53.943
Well here, I'll get it for you after the episode.

5508
03:48:53.943 --> 03:48:55.094
LAURA: Okay.

5509
03:48:55.094 --> 03:48:57.214
I'm just trying to figure out how much time we've got.

5510
03:48:57.214 --> 03:48:59.832
LIAM: Do you have a rough idea of how close we are to

5511
03:48:59.832 --> 03:49:01.582
go time for Traveler?

5512
03:49:02.439 --> 03:49:04.493
Roughly?
MATT: You are...

5513
03:49:04.493 --> 03:49:07.334
I have to look at the full count of all of our days left,

5514
03:49:07.334 --> 03:49:08.734
I'd say you're a number of weeks off.

5515
03:49:08.734 --> 03:49:09.933
LAURA: Okay. Okay.

5516
03:49:09.933 --> 03:49:11.168
MATT: You know, it's getting there.

5517
03:49:11.168 --> 03:49:12.149
LAURA: Yeah.

5518
03:49:12.149 --> 03:49:15.884
MATT: He says, "Anyway, I need a
full six ounces of this oil,

5519

"so it's going to-- I can procure for you

5521
03:49:23.532 --> 03:49:24.740
LAURA: Okay.

5522
03:49:24.740 --> 03:49:25.725
MATT: "I don't know if you're familiar

03:49:59.904 --> 03:50:01.013
TRAVIS: Sounds right.

5539
03:50:01.013 --> 03:50:02.754
TALIESIN: It's clever, they turn them into stone.

5540
03:50:02.754 --> 03:50:04.184
TRAVIS: Drawn on this very map.

5541

MATT: "Trust me, I almost became a Pumat piece of art

"when I almost forgot my gloves working on this thing."

03:50:09.026 --> 03:50:09.867
LAURA: Whoa.

5544
03:50:09.867 --> 03:50:11.983
MATT: "(laughs) That was a close one.

5545
03:50:11.983 --> 03:50:12.816
"Anyway.

5546
03:50:13.683 --> 03:50:14.516
"Yeah.

5547
03:50:14.516 --> 03:50:16.365
"So if you ever get that around back here,

5548
03:50:16.365 --> 03:50:17.936
"that'd be much appreciated."

5549
03:50:17.936 --> 03:50:21.725
SAM: Yeah, we'll definitely help you with that, Mr. Sol.

5550
03:50:21.725 --> 03:50:23.194
TALIESIN: Do you have anything in right now?

5551
03:50:23.194 --> 03:50:24.416
LIAM: Yeah, in the meantime?

5552
03:50:24.416 --> 03:50:27.551
MATT: "Eh," he pulls out a,

5553
03:50:27.551 --> 03:50:29.963
he says, "Most of the things up there are just for show.

5554
03:50:29.963 --> 03:50:32.874
"They're basic plus one enchantments.

5555
03:50:32.874 --> 03:50:34.885
"Or, you know, you guys seem to,"

5556
03:50:34.885 --> 03:50:36.003
looks at you,

5557
03:50:36.003 --> 03:50:39.296
"you came back here looking all mighty,

5558
03:50:39.296 --> 03:50:40.129
"I'm not going to lie."

5559
03:50:40.129 --> 03:50:41.085
(laughter)

5560
03:50:41.085 --> 03:50:42.464
LAURA: Hey!

5561
03:50:42.464 --> 03:50:44.615
MATT: "Ah, we're trying to keep up.

5562
03:50:44.615 --> 03:50:47.806
"I've got some healing potions," and he pulls up--

5563
03:50:47.806 --> 03:50:49.456
TRAVIS: Always interested in those, yeah.

5564
03:50:49.456 --> 03:50:50.562
MATT: He's got two healing potions,

5565
03:50:50.562 --> 03:50:51.744
two greater healing potions,

5566
03:50:51.744 --> 03:50:55.460
and one potion of superior healing for sale.

5567
03:50:55.460 --> 03:50:56.856
TRAVIS: We'll take all of them.

5568
03:50:56.856 --> 03:50:58.522
LAURA: How much are-- Those are expensive.

5569
03:50:58.522 --> 03:50:59.355
MATT: "Well, they're 50 gold apiece

5570
03:50:59.355 --> 03:51:00.546
"for the base healing potions,

5571
03:51:00.546 --> 03:51:02.445
"they're 250 for the greater,

5572
03:51:02.445 --> 03:51:07.445
"and 2,500 apiece for the single superior healing."

5573
03:51:07.626 --> 03:51:10.634
TRAVIS: 2,800 gold?
MARISHA: That's more expensive than my tattoo.

5574
03:51:10.634 --> 03:51:13.236
(laughter)

5575
03:51:13.236 --> 03:51:14.069
SAM: But in a pinch--

5576
03:51:14.069 --> 03:51:15.546
MARISHA: That was a magic trick.

5577
03:51:15.546 --> 03:51:16.379
SAM: Now these superiors are--

5578
03:51:16.379 --> 03:51:17.597
LIAM: What are you doing?

5579
03:51:17.597 --> 03:51:19.484
TRAVIS: Zero.
LAURA: We took the only superior that we had.

5580
03:51:19.484 --> 03:51:21.221
Fjord guzzled it really fast.

5581
03:51:21.221 --> 03:51:23.062
SAM: In a pinch.
TRAVIS: Well worth it, though.

5582
03:51:23.062 --> 03:51:25.085
You really care about me.

5583
03:51:25.085 --> 03:51:27.605
We'll take the superior and the two greater healings.

5584
03:51:27.605 --> 03:51:28.776
LAURA: Ooh!

5585
03:51:28.776 --> 03:51:29.609
MATT: "All righty."

5586
03:51:29.609 --> 03:51:31.356
TALIESIN: I'd actually say let's just take them all,

5587
03:51:31.356 --> 03:51:33.997
because even a minor healing potion will wake you up

5588
03:51:33.997 --> 03:51:35.336
if you get knocked down.

5589
03:51:35.336 --> 03:51:36.416
LAURA: It's true.

5590
03:51:36.416 --> 03:51:37.664
And then you can get back up again.

5591
03:51:37.664 --> 03:51:39.013
MATT: "Two regular as well, you're saying?"

5592
03:51:39.013 --> 03:51:40.776
TALIESIN: Take the whole kit n' caboodle.

5593
03:51:40.776 --> 03:51:42.557
MATT: "Oh yeah, no worries!"

5594
03:51:42.557 --> 03:51:44.005
LAURA: And get up again.

5595
03:51:44.005 --> 03:51:45.546
MATT: "By the way,

5596
03:51:45.546 --> 03:51:48.146
"can I just say again, how nice it is to see

5597
03:51:48.146 --> 03:51:50.845
"another firbolg this side of the Empire."

5598
03:51:50.845 --> 03:51:52.696
TALIESIN: It's been a while for me too, it's--

5599
03:51:52.696 --> 03:51:54.090
MATT: "Yeah, it was--

5600
03:51:54.090 --> 03:51:55.357
SAM: You guys have met, right?

5601
03:51:55.357 --> 03:51:56.216
You've met before?

5602
03:51:56.216 --> 03:51:57.165
TALIESIN: No, never.

5603
03:51:57.165 --> 03:51:57.998
SAM: You've not met?

5604
03:51:57.998 --> 03:52:00.524
TALIESIN: I was just trying out just being sarcastic.

5605
03:52:00.524 --> 03:52:01.775
SAM: Oh, oh, oh!

5606
03:52:01.775 --> 03:52:02.797
Hey, that was good!

5607
03:52:02.797 --> 03:52:04.016
MATT: "We met once before, yeah.

5608
03:52:04.016 --> 03:52:06.576
"Yeah, it's been a while, you know?

5609
03:52:06.576 --> 03:52:09.077
"Just, yeah, I'm liking the style--"

5610
03:52:09.077 --> 03:52:10.894
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you, I just

5611
03:52:10.894 --> 03:52:12.877
was looking for a bit of a change, you know.

5612
03:52:12.877 --> 03:52:14.976
MATT: "Yeah, all you guys really mixed it up."

5613
03:52:14.976 --> 03:52:16.346
TRAVIS: That'll be 350 gold from everybody.

5614
03:52:16.346 --> 03:52:17.645
TALIESIN: Oh, I can do that.

5615
03:52:17.645 --> 03:52:18.685
MATT: "Here ya go.

5616
03:52:18.685 --> 03:52:20.520
"Just lay these out here for ya.

5617
03:52:20.520 --> 03:52:22.513
"You can disseminate as you see fit."

5618
03:52:22.513 --> 03:52:24.973
LAURA: What kind of plus one things do you have?

5619
03:52:24.973 --> 03:52:26.936
MATT: "Oh, a plus one leather,

5620
03:52:26.936 --> 03:52:29.853
"I got a plus one shield over there.

5621
03:52:30.831 --> 03:52:34.253
"I got two of these potions of maximum power."

5622
03:52:34.253 --> 03:52:35.896
SAM: What is that, what is that?

5623
03:52:35.896 --> 03:52:38.594
MATT: "They're 750 gold apiece."
SAM: What do they do?

5624
03:52:38.594 --> 03:52:41.165
MATT: "Let me pull it out for ya."

5625
03:52:41.165 --> 03:52:43.043
TRAVIS: Maximum power?
SAM: I've never heard of such a thing.

5626
03:52:43.043 --> 03:52:44.192
Sounds metal!

5627
03:52:44.192 --> 03:52:45.125
MATT: He pulls it, shows it to you.

5628
03:52:45.125 --> 03:52:47.942
It's a vial with a glowing, purple liquid

5629
03:52:47.942 --> 03:52:49.285
that just swirls around inside

5630
03:52:49.285 --> 03:52:50.662
as he spins it a bit,

5631
03:52:50.662 --> 03:52:52.896
and the inside, it creates a small little vortex

5632
03:52:52.896 --> 03:52:54.885
that calms down.

5633
03:52:54.885 --> 03:52:56.954
"It doesn't taste real great, to be honest,

5634
03:52:56.954 --> 03:53:00.829
"but it really bolsters

5635
03:53:00.829 --> 03:53:03.074
"release of arcane power,

5636
03:53:03.074 --> 03:53:06.375
"you know, these are supposed to technically go

5637
03:53:06.375 --> 03:53:08.656
"to the front lines, but you know,

5638
03:53:08.656 --> 03:53:10.664
"I can pass it on to some friends here

5639
03:53:10.664 --> 03:53:13.834
"and some repeat customers, if you don't mind."

5640
03:53:13.834 --> 03:53:15.224
Essentially, just so you know what they do,

5641
03:53:15.224 --> 03:53:16.916
is you drink it, and within one minute

5642
03:53:16.916 --> 03:53:18.276
after drinking the potion,

5643
03:53:18.276 --> 03:53:20.455
instead of rolling the dice for damage dealt on something,

5644
03:53:20.455 --> 03:53:23.464
you can choose to instead use the highest number possible

5645
03:53:23.464 --> 03:53:24.780
for each die.

5646
03:53:24.780 --> 03:53:26.888
So it's like a maximum damage.

5647
03:53:26.888 --> 03:53:27.888
LAURA: On one turn?

5648
03:53:27.888 --> 03:53:29.655
MATT: Yeah, you have to use it within a minute.

5649
03:53:29.655 --> 03:53:32.291
No, it's whatever, you have one minute to use it,

5650
03:53:32.291 --> 03:53:33.545
and then if it happens--

5651
03:53:33.545 --> 03:53:35.207
SAM: So 10 rounds of maximum--

5652
03:53:35.207 --> 03:53:36.137
LAURA: No, no, no.

5653
03:53:36.137 --> 03:53:38.796
MATT: You have 10 rounds until it goes away,

5654
03:53:38.796 --> 03:53:40.596
and then once you cast a spell, it uses it.

5655
03:53:40.596 --> 03:53:41.756
SAM: Got it.

5656
03:53:41.756 --> 03:53:43.007
MARISHA: It's a scroll?

5657
03:53:43.007 --> 03:53:43.927
SAM: It's a potion.

5658
03:53:43.927 --> 03:53:45.985
TRAVIS: So if you have one thing that's 5d10 damage,

5659
03:53:45.985 --> 03:53:47.505
you do 50.

5660
03:53:47.505 --> 03:53:48.338
LAURA: So you get--

5661
03:53:48.338 --> 03:53:51.184
MATT: "That's 750 gold pieces for the single use,

5662
03:53:51.184 --> 03:53:53.264
"and he looks at the--"

5663
03:53:53.264 --> 03:53:54.624
LAURA: If you roll a crit and you--

5664
03:53:54.624 --> 03:53:57.064
MATT: "You know, I should probably keep one of these

5665
03:53:57.064 --> 03:53:58.534
"just because they were ordered,

5666
03:53:58.534 --> 03:54:00.085
"but if you want the one."

5667
03:54:00.085 --> 03:54:01.194
SAM: Sure.

5668
03:54:01.194 --> 03:54:04.115
TALIESIN: I think the one, because then,

5669
03:54:04.115 --> 03:54:05.902
I mean, that could be a one-two combo

5670
03:54:05.902 --> 03:54:08.034
that's pretty impressive, because I can also make things

5671
03:54:08.034 --> 03:54:09.715
vulnerable for up to one attack.

5672
03:54:09.715 --> 03:54:11.184
So that would double damage.

5673
03:54:11.184 --> 03:54:12.017
SAM: You could do that?

5674
03:54:12.017 --> 03:54:12.850
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5675
03:54:12.850 --> 03:54:13.683
SAM: Wow.

5676
03:54:13.683 --> 03:54:15.344
TRAVIS: We're definitely taking at least the one,

5677
03:54:15.344 --> 03:54:18.554
we don't want to put you in any precarious positions--

5678
03:54:18.554 --> 03:54:20.184
MARISHA: Any damage, or melee damage?

5679
03:54:20.184 --> 03:54:21.017
Or like--

5680
03:54:21.017 --> 03:54:22.683
TALIESIN: Magic damage.
LAURA: Any damage.

5681
03:54:22.683 --> 03:54:23.534
MARISHA: Wait, what?

5682
03:54:23.534 --> 03:54:25.508
MATT: Your ability?
TALIESIN: It's spell.

5683
03:54:25.508 --> 03:54:26.393
TRAVIS: No, it's only arcane.

5684
03:54:26.393 --> 03:54:27.365
MATT: This is arcane-only.

5685
03:54:27.365 --> 03:54:28.414
LAURA: Oh, okay.

5686
03:54:28.414 --> 03:54:31.081
MATT: But your ability is an attack.

5687
03:54:32.806 --> 03:54:33.742
SAM: Fireball?

5688
03:54:33.742 --> 03:54:35.917
MATT: It would not affect a spell unless the spell

5689
03:54:35.917 --> 03:54:37.845
had to roll to hit.

5690
03:54:37.845 --> 03:54:40.434
So, a ray spell or like, you know, Fire Bolt,

5691
03:54:40.434 --> 03:54:41.855
or something you had to roll.

5692
03:54:41.855 --> 03:54:43.354
TALIESIN: I could double a Fire Bolt.

5693
03:54:43.354 --> 03:54:44.575
MATT: Yeah.

5694
03:54:44.575 --> 03:54:47.396
LIAM: To one target as 12d6.

5695
03:54:47.396 --> 03:54:49.325
TRAVIS: Yes, we'll take that.

5696
03:54:49.325 --> 03:54:50.369
TALIESIN: And then if it hits, I can--

5697
03:54:50.369 --> 03:54:52.469
MATT: "All righty, got that one there for you."

5698
03:54:52.469 --> 03:54:53.646
"And I got this other,

5699
03:54:53.646 --> 03:54:56.897
"this, sorry, everything else is pretty much on order

5700
03:54:56.897 --> 03:54:58.859
"except for this," and he pulls up

5701
03:54:58.859 --> 03:55:03.859
a thick, squat metallic casing.

5702
03:55:04.365 --> 03:55:07.396
Looks like what would be a heavy perfume bottle,

5703
03:55:07.396 --> 03:55:10.245
but it's made of some sort of tin material,

5704
03:55:10.245 --> 03:55:12.284
with a rubber capper on top, it's wrapped around it,

5705
03:55:12.284 --> 03:55:16.467
and he goes, "This is called oil of tempering.

5706
03:55:16.467 --> 03:55:20.400
"You can rub it on a piece of armor

5707
03:55:20.400 --> 03:55:25.067
"and for the next 24 hours or so, it gets a little boost."

5708
03:55:26.451 --> 03:55:27.440
SAM: Oh.

5709
03:55:27.440 --> 03:55:28.859
MATT: "This one's got ah,

5710
03:55:28.859 --> 03:55:32.549
"this one's only got two applications to it."

5711
03:55:32.549 --> 03:55:34.199
TRAVIS: How much of a boost?

5712
03:55:34.199 --> 03:55:36.749
MATT: "Oh, plus one to your armor class for 24 hours."

5713
03:55:36.749 --> 03:55:37.627
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

5714
03:55:37.627 --> 03:55:38.460
How much is it?

5715
03:55:38.460 --> 03:55:40.147
MATT: "Takes about an hour to apply it,

5716
03:55:40.147 --> 03:55:44.838
"and this one'll run you about 1,200 gold pieces."

5717
03:55:44.838 --> 03:55:46.326
TALIESIN: It's a little rich for my blood.

5718
03:55:46.326 --> 03:55:47.757
SAM: For one AC?

5719
03:55:47.757 --> 03:55:50.678
LAURA: How much is that shield of plus one?

5720
03:55:50.678 --> 03:55:52.638
MATT: "What, the plus one shield?

5721
03:55:52.638 --> 03:55:56.138
"Let me go ahead and check there real fast."

5722
03:55:58.780 --> 03:56:01.048
TRAVIS: Plus two, I'd be all over it.

5723
03:56:01.048 --> 03:56:03.298
MARISHA: For 24 hours, it's rough.

5724
03:56:09.709 --> 03:56:12.059
MATT: He goes ahead and starts going through the book,

5725
03:56:12.059 --> 03:56:13.795
in the back there, as you're waiting patiently,

5726
03:56:13.795 --> 03:56:15.545
you're sitting there.

5727
03:56:16.458 --> 03:56:18.708
LAURA: (whistles "Jeopardy!" theme)

5728
03:56:21.628 --> 03:56:23.688
MATT: What's your armor class, Caduceus?

5729
03:56:23.688 --> 03:56:24.521
TALIESIN: 18.

5730
03:56:29.419 --> 03:56:33.236
MATT: You feel this searing pain in your back.

5731
03:56:34.459 --> 03:56:38.242
This sudden burst of intense,

5732
03:56:38.242 --> 03:56:41.366
deep piercing pain.

5733
03:56:41.366 --> 03:56:42.460
SAM: What?

5734
03:56:42.460 --> 03:56:45.270
MATT: Your breath halts in your chest for a second

5735
03:56:45.270 --> 03:56:48.187
as the muscles in your torso seize.

5736
03:56:49.390 --> 03:56:50.223
SAM: Wh-what?

5737
03:56:51.299 --> 03:56:52.310
MATT: You--

5738
03:56:52.310 --> 03:56:53.368
TRAVIS: Did you touch it?

5739
03:56:53.368 --> 03:56:54.990
TALIESIN: I didn't touch anything.

5740
03:56:54.990 --> 03:56:56.019
LAURA: Something's attacking him!

5741
03:56:56.019 --> 03:56:57.835
MATT: Suffer--
LAURA: It's invisible!

5742
03:57:01.763 --> 03:57:02.829
MATT: 13...

5743
03:57:02.829 --> 03:57:04.783
LIAM: It's the fish and chips.

5744
03:57:04.783 --> 03:57:05.616
MATT: Yep.

5745
03:57:05.616 --> 03:57:07.225
SAM: Pumat is the mole.

5746
03:57:11.013 --> 03:57:13.560
What is happening, is there an invisible guy in the shop?

5747
03:57:13.560 --> 03:57:17.056
LAURA: There's got to be somebody invisible.

5748
03:57:17.056 --> 03:57:20.114
MARISHA: Is the searing pain in the back of your neck?

5749
03:57:20.114 --> 03:57:20.947
LAURA: Or in your back?

5750
03:57:20.947 --> 03:57:23.012
TALIESIN: In my back, right?

5751
03:57:23.012 --> 03:57:24.123
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

5752
03:57:24.123 --> 03:57:25.261
TRAVIS: My thing lasts for an hour

5753
03:57:25.261 --> 03:57:26.761
and I cast it in--

5754
03:57:27.850 --> 03:57:30.874
MATT: You take 45 points of slashing damage.

5755
03:57:30.874 --> 03:57:31.837
TALIESIN: Oh shit!

5756
03:57:31.837 --> 03:57:33.536
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw for me, please.

5757
03:57:33.536 --> 03:57:34.369
MARISHA: Attacked.

5758
03:57:34.369 --> 03:57:35.369
You are being attacked.

5759
03:57:35.369 --> 03:57:37.365
LAURA: Would we see it? Can we see it happen?

5760
03:57:37.365 --> 03:57:38.340
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Hold on.

5761
03:57:38.340 --> 03:57:40.092
TALIESIN: I make a constitution saving throw?

5762
03:57:40.092 --> 03:57:42.509
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Okay.

5763
03:57:44.924 --> 03:57:45.922
15.

5764
03:57:45.922 --> 03:57:46.839
MATT: 15, okay.

5765
03:57:48.564 --> 03:57:52.844
From that intense pain, you feel something begin to,

5766
03:57:52.844 --> 03:57:55.863
very briefly begin to corrupt into your veins

5767
03:57:55.863 --> 03:57:58.003
and your body shrugs off

5768
03:57:58.003 --> 03:58:02.764
whatever force or thing is trying to pierce--

5769
03:58:02.764 --> 03:58:06.063
TALIESIN: I cast Detect Magic and swing behind me.

5770
03:58:06.063 --> 03:58:08.804
MATT: You guys hear this strange,

5771
03:58:08.804 --> 03:58:11.164
(stifled gasps) from Caduceus,

5772
03:58:11.164 --> 03:58:13.095
Caduceus leans forward,

5773
03:58:13.095 --> 03:58:14.735
you all spin around and look,

5774
03:58:14.735 --> 03:58:19.670
and there, just creeping up out of the ground, you see

5775
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:22.586
a female form,

5776
03:58:22.586 --> 03:58:27.124
dull, gray, almost blue-purple skin,

5777
03:58:27.124 --> 03:58:30.444
black headband, bright red hair,

5778
03:58:30.444 --> 03:58:32.943
that spills down in front of the face,

5779
03:58:32.943 --> 03:58:36.759
cloak and armor, with a deep grin,

5780
03:58:36.759 --> 03:58:40.575
as she draws one of two dark, envenomed daggers

5781
03:58:40.575 --> 03:58:42.863
from the back of Caduceus.

5782
03:58:42.863 --> 03:58:44.655
And kind of laughs. (laughs softly)

5783
03:58:44.655 --> 03:58:46.213
Before (quiet whoosh)

5784
03:58:46.213 --> 03:58:48.623
shifting back into the ground like a ghost.

5785
03:58:48.623 --> 03:58:49.873
TRAVIS: O-oh--
SAM: What?

5786
03:58:50.954 --> 03:58:52.164
TRAVIS: Oh shit, is that the--

5787
03:58:52.164 --> 03:58:54.503
is that the name, is that the fourth horseman,

5788
03:58:54.503 --> 03:58:55.663
is that the, is that the--

5789
03:58:55.663 --> 03:58:56.496
SAM: What?

5790
03:58:56.496 --> 03:58:58.254
MATT: As Pumat says,

5791
03:58:58.254 --> 03:58:59.421
"W-what was that?"

5792
03:59:00.471 --> 03:59:01.535
SAM: Are you okay?

5793
03:59:01.535 --> 03:59:02.918
TALIESIN: No!

5794
03:59:02.918 --> 03:59:03.751
MATT: And that's where we'll pick up.

5795
03:59:03.751 --> 03:59:05.724
(shouting)

5796
03:59:05.724 --> 03:59:06.935
TRAVIS: What's the name, what's the name, what's the name!

5797
03:59:06.935 --> 03:59:08.103
MARISHA: I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

5798
03:59:08.103 --> 03:59:08.936
LIAM: Caedogast?

5799
03:59:08.936 --> 03:59:10.204
TRAVIS: The invulnerable, no, the--

5800
03:59:10.204 --> 03:59:11.084
LAURA: The Inevitable End!

5801
03:59:11.084 --> 03:59:12.424
TRAVIS: The Inevitable End!

5802
03:59:12.424 --> 03:59:13.959
SAM: Is that what it looks like?

5803
03:59:13.959 --> 03:59:15.209
TRAVIS: I don't know!

5804
03:59:16.138 --> 03:59:17.268
MATT: Caedogeist.

5805
03:59:17.268 --> 03:59:18.717
MARISHA: Huh?
MATT: Caedogeist is the name.

5806
03:59:18.717 --> 03:59:20.726
MARISHA: Is that it?
SAM: Is that who it was?

5807
03:59:20.726 --> 03:59:21.668
LIAM: We'll find out next week.

5808
03:59:21.668 --> 03:59:23.852
MATT: You have no idea, you've never seen them.

5809
03:59:23.852 --> 03:59:25.561
TRAVIS: (gasps) Avantika lives!

5810
03:59:25.561 --> 03:59:26.687
LAURA: I know, I thought of that.

5811
03:59:26.687 --> 03:59:29.668
LIAM: They're the chosen assassin of Lolth, so--

5812
03:59:29.668 --> 03:59:30.909
LAURA: Oh my god!
LIAM: Good chance--

5813
03:59:30.909 --> 03:59:33.308
TALIESIN: I just took a lot of fucking damage, by the way.

5814
03:59:33.308 --> 03:59:34.227
LAURA: 45--

5815
03:59:34.227 --> 03:59:36.727
SAM: Well, we just bought a bunch of health potions, so--

5816
03:59:36.727 --> 03:59:38.588
TRAVIS: What is-- how did you--

5817
03:59:38.588 --> 03:59:41.458
that came out of nowhere!

5818
03:59:41.458 --> 03:59:43.919
MARISHA: That has to be--
TRAVIS: Keep your hands in your pockets!

5819
03:59:43.919 --> 03:59:46.418
TALIESIN: I didn't hit anything with my damn swing, did I?

5820
03:59:46.418 --> 03:59:47.799
No?

5821
03:59:47.799 --> 03:59:49.359
MATT: You could roll--

5822
03:59:49.359 --> 03:59:51.804
TALIESIN: That's okay, I mean--
SAM: You can roll.

5823
03:59:51.804 --> 03:59:55.177
MARISHA: Jourrael.
TRAVIS: That was so out of nowhere!

5824
03:59:55.177 --> 03:59:56.807
SAM: We're shopping, Matt!

5825
03:59:56.807 --> 03:59:57.640
TALIESIN: 23?

5826
03:59:57.640 --> 03:59:59.467
MATT: It's like assassins are really good at what they do.

5827
03:59:59.467 --> 04:00:00.807
MARISHA: That's, yeah.

5828
04:00:00.807 --> 04:00:01.976
TALIESIN: 23.

5829
04:00:01.976 --> 04:00:03.286
MATT: 23?
MARISHA: Holy shit.

5830
04:00:03.286 --> 04:00:04.948
TRAVIS: Into the ground?

5831
04:00:04.948 --> 04:00:07.034
MATT: As you swing outwards towards it,

5832
04:00:07.034 --> 04:00:11.068
you swing wide towards this

5833
04:00:11.068 --> 04:00:14.075
strange, spectral drow-like figure,

5834
04:00:14.075 --> 04:00:15.927
and as it pulls into the ground,

5835
04:00:15.927 --> 04:00:18.028
it uses its reaction to, shink!

5836
04:00:18.028 --> 04:00:19.347
Parry it out of the way.

5837
04:00:19.347 --> 04:00:20.276
It does not hit.

5838
04:00:20.276 --> 04:00:22.418
TALIESIN: Damn.
TRAVIS: 23?

5839
04:00:22.418 --> 04:00:23.479
TALIESIN: Parried that.

5840
04:00:24.446 --> 04:00:27.004
Yep.
MARISHA: You said spectral?

5841
04:00:27.004 --> 04:00:28.647
She's a specter. The Inevitable End,

5842
04:00:28.647 --> 04:00:29.767
I wrote down specter.

5843
04:00:29.767 --> 04:00:31.538
TALIESIN: Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.

5844
04:00:31.538 --> 04:00:32.778
Fuck, all right, that's fine.

5845
04:00:32.778 --> 04:00:36.565
MATT: So we'll take up with whatever's happening now

5846
04:00:36.565 --> 04:00:37.904
in The Invulnerable Vagrant

5847
04:00:37.904 --> 04:00:39.129
next week.
SAM: Shopping episode!

5848
04:00:39.129 --> 04:00:40.938
TRAVIS: Protect Pumat!

5849
04:00:40.938 --> 04:00:42.028
Protect Pumat!

5850
04:00:42.028 --> 04:00:43.527
TALIESIN: Oh, this is like full on Ballroom Blitz,

5851
04:00:43.527 --> 04:00:46.156
we can actually, everything's a weapon.

5852
04:00:46.156 --> 04:00:46.989
MATT: Oh yeah.

5853
04:00:46.989 --> 04:00:48.497
TALIESIN: Everything, there's nothing in the--

5854
04:00:48.497 --> 04:00:50.293
oh, you don't! You don't!
LIAM: Yes, yes!

5855
04:00:50.293 --> 04:00:51.126
We're going to fight.

5856
04:00:51.126 --> 04:00:53.167
There's a map for the shop!
SAM: We're doing a combat cam

5857
04:00:53.167 --> 04:00:55.246

04:01:02.795 --> 04:01:03.628
ALL: Whoa!

5863
04:01:03.628 --> 04:01:06.061
MATT: -- fighting inside The Invulnerable Vagrant next week.

5864
04:01:06.061 --> 04:01:08.038
MARISHA: Oh my god!

5865
04:01:08.038 --> 04:01:09.270
MATT: So!

5866
04:01:09.270 --> 04:01:10.673
We'll pick up on that,

5867
04:01:10.673 --> 04:01:11.754
where's my chair?

5868
04:01:11.754 --> 04:01:13.654
TALIESIN: Fuck!
LAURA: So cool.

5869
04:01:13.654 --> 04:01:17.161
TRAVIS: Holy shit.
MATT: Next Thursday.

5870
04:01:17.161 --> 04:01:18.492
Until then, guys.

5871
04:01:18.492 --> 04:01:20.550
Thank you so much for joining us.

5872
04:01:20.550 --> 04:01:21.541
We love you very much,

04:01:21.541 --> 04:01:23.660
and is it Thursday yet?

5874
04:01:23.660 --> 04:01:25.034
Good night.

5875
04:01:25.034 --> 04:01:27.784
(dramatic music)

00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.910
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.960
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.517
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:09.472
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
LIAM: (triumphant trumpeting)

00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:11.560
MATT: Before we jump into tonight's session,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.170
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.550
including and first up, our two sponsors for tonight,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.219
beginning with our first sponsor, Ravensburger.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.809
Sam.
TALIESIN: Ravensburger.

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:22.600
SAM: Oh! Doc!
TRAVIS: What?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.633
SAM: Doc!

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.302
I'm back from the future with crazy news!

00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:28.910
LIAM: I can barely see the script through these glasses.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.937
We've done this before, Marty, how bad could it be?

00:00:32.937 --> 00:00:37.937
SAM: You don't get it, Doc, I went to the year 2020,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.535
and it was heavy.

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:40.490
LIAM: Heavy?

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.620
What, did Biff stir up more trouble

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.040
with his Sports Almanac?
(laughter)

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.873
SAM: I mean, yeah,

00:00:46.873 --> 00:00:49.606
sports isn't really a thing any more in 2020.

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:51.320
LIAM: Oh, is it your kids, Marty?

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.760
Are they in trouble?

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.660
SAM: Kids, parents, pretty much everyone.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.197
It's kind of a global thing.

00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:58.552
LIAM: No, no, no, don't tell me too much!

00:00:58.552 --> 00:01:01.040
It could affect reality as we know it.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.859
Oh.
(laughter)

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.702
SAM: Whoa, Doc, are you checking a photo

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:06.997
to see if I'm disappearing?

00:01:06.997 --> 00:01:09.440
LIAM: No, Marty, it's a picture of Matt Mercer.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.100
His face, it's so elastic; I love it!

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.460
SAM: Yeah, it is pretty funny.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.440
Listen, Doc, about 2020, it gets pretty rough.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.220
LIAM: No matter what happens, I'm sure you solved it

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.380
with some hilarious antics, like riding a hoverboard

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.980
or wearing a Darth Vader mask to fool your dad.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.808
SAM: I mean, I did wear a mask.

00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:30.500
LIAM: Got a little There Will Be Blood there for a second.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.620
And did you punch Biff in the face?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.960
SAM: No, I didn't get within six feet of Biff,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.170
or really anyone.
LIAM: Great Scott!

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.240
Marty, was there anything good about 2020?

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.420
SAM: Actually, there was.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.830
The folks at Ravensburger released their new

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.430
cooperative dice game,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.761
Back to the Future: Dice Through Time.

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:50.650
In it, Biff steals the DeLorean

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.780
and takes a joyride through time

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.040
doing untold damage to the space-time continuum.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.560
It's up to you to restore the temporal order.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.490
LIAM: Oh, great Scott, that sounds more like it!

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.050
SAM: So jump into your DeLorean,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.830
traverse the Back to the Future film trilogy,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.390
and return items to their...

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:11.954
proper place in time.
(laughter)

00:02:11.954 --> 00:02:14.000
The game includes four miniature--

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.132
Is this close to the voice?

00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:17.203
It's not, is it?
MARISHA: Well--

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.362
MATT: No.
MARISHA: A little Morty, it's fine.

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:21.738
ASHLEY: It sounds great.
(laughter)

00:02:21.738 --> 00:02:25.105
SAM: The game includes four miniature DeLoreans,

00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:27.460
a letter from the future's Doc Brown,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.628
and colorful dice, Scoob!

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:32.190
And you can enter--
(laughter)

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.010
And, like, you can enter for your chance

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.181
to win a copy of the game by heading over

00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.770
to @RavensburgerNA on Twitter to, like,

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.870
see where they're giving away

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.957
10 copies of the game right now!

00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:48.610
It's available at Target and in the UK.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.535
It's at Target, which is a store, or the country--

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:54.505
(laughter)

00:02:54.505 --> 00:02:56.337
of the United Kingdom.

00:02:58.081 --> 00:02:59.840
So two places you can get it, guys:

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.867
at Target, or the entire nation of the United Kingdom.

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:08.750
So go check it out at http://bit.ly/CROUTATIME.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.990
That'll be spelled.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.110
And thanks to Ravensburger for, like,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.830
continuing to support our show.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.870
(laughter)
MATT: Whoa.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.180
SAM: That was a disaster, Liam.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.370
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Wait, what did that sound--

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.536
LIAM: Hold on, let me just get this

00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:23.594
tribble off my head.
LAURA: It sounds like Rick and Morty.

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:25.870
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: You were Morty.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.455
SAM: I don't do voices.

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:29.240
TALIESIN: Have you ever seen Back to the Future?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.265
SAM: I have seen it!
LAURA: Question, Matthew Mercer.

00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:32.098
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Is it

00:03:32.098 --> 00:03:34.320
Rav-ensburger or Ravens-burger?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.650
ASHLEY: Rahv-ensburger.
MATT: I--

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.660
LAURA: Rahv-ensburger?

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.700
MATT: I probably said it incorrectly

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.790
because "raven" is written in the word

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.750
and I said raven, but it's
possibly, probably, Rahv-ensburger.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.850
My apologies to our friends Rahv-ensburger.
SAM: We'll find out, maybe,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.560
from the sponsor.
(laughter)

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.430
If it's not, here, I'll just record it.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.220
Ravens-burger, and they can take that.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.070
TRAVIS: Give us a second one.
SAM: Raven-sburger.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.220
ASHLEY: Rahv-ensburger.
SAM: They can take that

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.060
and put it in in post, right, Marisha?

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.910
Is that how that works?

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.622
MARISHA: I'm not going to make the team do that.

00:04:02.622 --> 00:04:05.533
(laughter)

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:07.580
TRAVIS: You sleep with it.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.876
ASHLEY: Listen, they make world-famous puzzles.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:12.859
LIAM: Wonderful.

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.270
SAM: I've been playing so many of them

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.650
over the lockdown period, oh my god.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.000
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.500
They've won awards, I think.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.226
SAM: Yeah, they're great.
MATT: That's awesome.

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:22.309
ASHLEY: Pretty sure.

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:24.685
LIAM: Also, for the audience's benefit,

00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:26.910
Sam agonized over which part he should play

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.299
for the 10 minutes leading up to the start of the show.

00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:30.520
(laughter)

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.680
SAM: I think I chose wisely.
LIAM: He does them both badly.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.840
MATT: Well, Sam, could you please give us an example

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.380
of your Doc Brown, if you don't mind?

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.920
LAURA: Please.
SAM: (clears throat)

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.635
We've done this before, Marty,

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:42.200
how bad could it be?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.049
Heavy?

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:46.765
Did Biff stir up more trouble with his Sports Almanac?

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:49.015
LIAM: And now, for the feats of strength.

00:04:49.015 --> 00:04:51.265
(laughter)

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.591
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:54.850
MATT: I think you chose properly.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.510
SAM: Thank you.
ASHLEY: Thank you, that was good.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.568
MATT: Thank you, Rahvens-Ravens-burger.

00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:02.500
And thank you to our second sponsor

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.960
who's been with us since the beginning of Campaign 2,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.557
D&amp;D Beyond.
TRAVIS: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.640
MATT: D&amp;D Beyond, as you should know by now,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.140

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.170

your characters, and all sorts of stuff.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.070
They're awesome, and you can currently pre-order

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.370

and a unique set of digital dice

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.020
you can use within the tool.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.570

We have a few more announcements to get through,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.451
beginning with Marisha.

00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:40.840
MARISHA: Yes. Content alert.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.525
You can join us on Tuesday,

00:05:44.525 --> 00:05:47.250

for our next episode of
All Work No Play: Unplugged

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.595
featuring Laura Bailey!

00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.412
(cheering)

00:05:53.412 --> 00:05:54.869
SAM: We had such a great time.

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:56.916
LIAM: Best episode.
MARISHA: See how surprised even she looks?

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:57.749
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah!

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:58.774
TRAVIS: I was like, a Laura Bailey.
MARISHA: If you missed--

00:05:58.774 --> 00:06:00.040
LAURA: I know, a Laura Bailey.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.781
TRAVIS: A Laura Bailey.
MARISHA and ASHLEY: A Laura Bailey.

00:06:01.781 --> 00:06:04.433
LIAM: Allura Vysoren.

00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:05.520
MARISHA: Of course, if you miss the stream,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.190
the VOD will be available on our Twitch channel immediately

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.260
and on YouTube the following Thursday,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.310
like 36 hours, something like that.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.776
TRAVIS: Dope.
LAURA: Tight.

00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:15.860
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Tight, tight, tight.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.210
MATT: Thank you, Marisha.
LIAM: It's the best episode

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.043
we've done of the show.

00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:19.118
LAURA: Definitely.
MARISHA: No doubt.

00:06:19.118 --> 00:06:20.700
SAM: 100%.
LAURA: Definitely.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.670
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.470
MATT: And speaking of Laura Bailey, a Laura Bailey,

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.610
you have some things to talk about, too.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.140
LAURA: I have a few things to talk about right now.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.228
Oh man, you guys.

00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:34.080
TRAVIS: Oh, there she is!
LAURA: This Funko Pop.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.280
So this was released yesterday!

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.310
It was our Comic-Con exclusive,

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.082
and due to circumstances, it is now available...

00:06:45.453 --> 00:06:49.400
(laughter)
...at Best Buy!

00:06:50.348 --> 00:06:52.423
And at funko.com.

00:06:54.368 --> 00:06:56.940
And it's going to be available in our UK shop.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.000
It might be available right now in our UK shop,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.165
I don't know, go check it out.

00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:02.853
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:04.890
LAURA: Our second thing that I want to talk about,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.940
Liam O'Brien, roll that beautiful.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.773
Look at this.

00:07:08.773 --> 00:07:11.200
SAM: What is that?
MARISHA: It's so cute!

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.630
LAURA: Our very first button down, you guys.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.380
SAM: Oh wow.
MATT: It finally happened.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.213
LAURA: I know.

00:07:17.213 --> 00:07:19.880
So it features all the Mighty Nein weapons

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.320
and was designed by Adriann Helton,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.762
and I'm in love with it.

00:07:24.762 --> 00:07:26.920
It's really--
SAM: Could you wear that to work?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.660
LAURA: You could, I think.
SAM: If work happens ever.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.840
LAURA: I feel like it's awesome.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.500
It feels nice.
LIAM: It's got Skingorger on it!

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.333
MATT: It's awesome.

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:37.472
LAURA: I mean, I'm biased, but I think it's pretty cool.

00:07:37.472 --> 00:07:38.810
SAM: That's so--
TRAVIS: Hold it up higher.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.520
LAURA: Yeah, hold it up higher so you can see.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.775
Yeah, there's a little red there on it.

00:07:41.775 --> 00:07:43.270
MARISHA: With the little button!
TRAVIS: A little button at the bottom.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.378
SAM: That's professional.

00:07:44.378 --> 00:07:47.503
ASHLEY: Listen, you guys know I love a good button down.

00:07:47.503 --> 00:07:49.697
I'm very excited about this shirt.

00:07:49.697 --> 00:07:51.805
I will be wearing it under a suit.
TRAVIS: Orphan Maker approved.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.789
LAURA: That's available in the U.S. and the UK shops.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.710
And last thing, we had a ton of requests,

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.360
I got a lot of messages about it,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.110
asking if we would do some masks.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.010
So you may have seen me holding this a couple weeks ago

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.640
but I can finally announce,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.857
these are available.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:13.137
So they come in a two pack.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.430
Like this, one of the Captain Tusktooth, designed by <i>moi</i>,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.850
and the other one is the Mighty Nein little,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.167
oh, I guess it's Vox Machina and Mighty Nein.

00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:27.650
It's the little doodles by Wendy, @WendyDoodles.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.030
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.630
LAURA: So yeah, all of the purchases

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.130
will benefit our friends at Red Nose Day,

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.250
and they are providing vital aid to children

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.150
who are below the poverty line

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.590
and have been impacted negatively by COVID-19,

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.830
and that's not how you wear it.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.860
SAM: You could.
LAURA: You could,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.440
but you shouldn't.
ASHLEY: You could wear one

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.251
on up and then one.
SAM: Yeah.

00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:53.440
LAURA: And it's got a little pocket

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.310
so you can put a filter in it.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.980
And a little metal in it

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.000
so you can squish your nose.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.600
LIAM: You have to protect your blowhole.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.433
LAURA: Yeah.

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:02.090
So yeah, you get two in each packet,

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.371
and then we also have kids' sizes available.

00:09:04.371 --> 00:09:06.430
SAM: Oh!
MARISHA: Yeah, kiddos.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.630
ASHLEY: That is awesome.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.370
LAURA: So yeah, those, we'll donate $10 to Red Nose Day

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.180
for every purchase made.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.160
And our masks are available right now

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.660
in the U.S. and the UK shops,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.130
and will be in our Australian store very soon as well.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.650
SAM: Australian store.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.520
If they're not already.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.070
Go check it out because I don't know,

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.179
they may have shown up by now.

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:27.730
(laughter)

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.880
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.713
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

00:09:29.713 --> 00:09:31.200
TRAVIS: Yay, Red Nose Day!

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.346
LAURA: Yeah, yay Red Nose Day.

00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:34.360
MATT: (sighs) All righty.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.580
That is the last of our announcements.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.900
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.320
MATT: And as such, it's time to bring us

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.324
into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:09:43.324 --> 00:09:46.187
(random cast noises)

00:09:46.187 --> 00:09:48.114
(water bubbling)

00:09:48.114 --> 00:09:50.305
(thunder rumbling)

TRAVIS: That's twice in two weeks

00:11:24.715 --> 00:11:26.046
that we're both super late.

00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:26.879
MATT: Welcome back.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:30.093
(laughter)

00:11:30.093 --> 00:11:33.960
So last we left off: The Mighty Nein,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.926
you had made your way to the island of Rumblecusp

00:11:36.926 --> 00:11:39.400
to prepare the coming of Traveler Con,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.480
where all the various followers of The Traveler

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.000
are to convene and celebrate him,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.770
and as the Traveler would want it,

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.210
probably also convince them to stop following him

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.190
in such a large number.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.010
He can't quite deal with the responsibility,

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.555
it's driving him a little insane,

00:11:53.555 --> 00:11:58.555
and as an archfey, not his thing any more as much.

00:11:59.061 --> 00:12:01.630
Let me see if I can get a better sense of music here.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.463
Here we go.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.810
So upon arriving, you set your crew to watch the ship,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.830
you head into the village of Vo.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.840
You discover there are people who live on this island,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.470
an entire village of individuals

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.720
from different walks of life,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.500
different age groups, different backgrounds,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.280
and all seem to have lost their memory.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.600
But they live as a positive community,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.170
they support each other, a very simple lifestyle

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.540
bereft of trinkets and wealth,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.590
and you find it's because these are given

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.060
to the god of the island, the fire god known as Vokodo,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.160
that lives within the volcano of Rumblecusp.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.470
You wanted to go speak to this god to get permission

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.930
to bring The Traveler here and have this event,

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.600
and as such, you had Viridian,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.010
the druidic spiritual guardian of the Vo

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.760
guide you through dangerous territory

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.450
to the exterior of the volcano itself,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.250
traveling through the tunnels

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.580
and the various challenges that await.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.760
You met with Vokodo,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.620
this strange entity that existed

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.680
in the breathable warm waters

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.283
underneath the mountain itself,

00:13:07.283 --> 00:13:12.270
gave gifts that were accepted, eventually, for some of you,

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.750
and were given permission to, yes, bring them here,

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.580
bring everyone to be part of this event.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.830
You all then exited the mountain

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.320
and decided to stay the night

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.290
at the cusp of the tunnel's exit.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.310
As you all began to bed down,

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.840
sneakily placed a
Greater Restoration spell upon Viridian,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.320
cleansing her of the foggy memory

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.250
that has kept her from understanding who she was

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.100
and where she was from for well over two decades.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.310
And it was revealed that Viridian was not her name,

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.310
her name is Vilya, and apparently is from Tal'Dorei.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.830
And that was where we left off.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.610
So as you all sit in your encampment

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.050
at the edge of the cavern's mouth

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.250
you can see Vilya is now currently in the process

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:05.270
of processing this immediate influx

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.933
of long lost information about herself.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:13.803
"Um."

00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:17.402
LAURA: How long have you been here?

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.610
MATT: "Going on probably

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.397
"two and a half decades, longer."

00:14:26.397 --> 00:14:27.230
LIAM: Oh.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:29.900
And how did you find yourself

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.207
stranded here in the first place?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.378
MATT: "To not go into it too extensively,

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.550
"the people that I belong to, the Ashari,

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.690
"are disparate druidic tribes,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.110
"very much tied to the elements themselves

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.700
"and the plains beyond Exandria,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.160
"and I had gone on a journey to prove myself

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.980
"as the next to come leader of my people.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.100
"I nearly completed it,

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.520
"and one of the final tasks I was to attempt

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.080
"involved a dangerous journey

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.671
"and avoidance of a

00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:10.939
"terrible beast in the Plane of Water,

00:15:10.939 --> 00:15:12.380
"known as a kraken.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.400
"I failed, as I was unable to complete the trial

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.110
"and nearly lost my life in the process,

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.482
"instead losing my leg,"

00:15:21.482 --> 00:15:23.780
and she gestures to the tangle of vines

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.135
that now forms a living prosthetic.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.860
"I almost lost my life.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.633
"I was cut off from the gateway that was my entrance,

00:15:36.633 --> 00:15:38.320
"and I, in trying to flee,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.980
"just followed the currents as best I could

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.120
"to keep at bay from this creature,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.090
"transforming into whatever I could to keep myself alive.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.298
"Going into the dark depths and using my final

00:15:54.298 --> 00:15:59.298
"bit of conserved magics to find the right path.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:04.570
"I managed to come upon a small entrance,

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.700
"or exit, a doorway, a tear between the realms,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.700
"and was, I guess, jettisoned here.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.880
"I was unconscious for the better part of a week

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.100
"and when I came to, the people of Vo had found me

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.460
"by the base of the mountain on the eastern side."

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.870
LAURA: What area is that in?

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.871
MATT: "That's near the Heaven Falls."

00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:31.460
LAURA: Oh.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.420
LIAM: I'm so sorry.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:38.110
MATT: "By then my memory was already fading.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.580
"Whatever magic takes this island,

"whatever this Vokodo is capable

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.143
"of enshrouding upon this island works quickly."

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.103
LAURA: Does that mean we're at risk right now?

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.020
MATT: "I can imagine.

"within but a matter of days

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:02.710
"began to forget quite a bit of who they once were."

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.580
TRAVIS: And you think this magic extends from Vokodo,

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.210
not from the island itself?

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.010
MATT: "I don't know.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.010
"But it all seems to be serving Vokodo directly."

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.800
LIAM: And forgive us, but how has this community grown

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.141
in these two decades, did you say, here?

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.770
MATT: "It depends on individuals that come and stay.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.700
"There are many ships that pass by and leave within a day,

"I guess before the ensnaring charms

"of this island erase who they once were.

"But those that have reasons to stay for a while--

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.520
"we have those who've been shipwrecked,

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.853
"we have those who come here of their own accord to explore,

00:17:45.853 --> 00:17:48.260
"some who wish to leave wealth here.

"Many...

"in hopes of keeping them here

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.790
LIAM: Were there fewer when you arrived?

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.915
MATT: "There were."

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.660
SAM: So all these people are, in a sense,

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.610
being kept here against their will.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.520
MATT: "They wouldn't think so.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.880
"Some of them would be.

"Some have been there their whole life, I believe."

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.480
LIAM: And what do you think now?

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.960
MATT: "Right now?"
LIAM: Yeah.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.910
MATT: "I think this is a travesty.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.290
"These people have been robbed of their will,

"their past, their families.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.787
"I know I've probably been robbed of mine."

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.310
SAM: Did you have a family back there?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.410
MATT: "I think I do.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.277
"It's been some time."

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.630
LAURA: So wait, are you from another dimension?

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.540
You said you came through a portal, or something.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.060
Does that mean you're not from this plane?

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.140
MATT: "I'm from here,

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.320
"but outside of Exandria there are--

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.990
"how versed are you in the overall

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.424
"planar structure of the world and beyond?"

00:19:09.424 --> 00:19:12.270
LAURA: Oh, very, very well versed.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.235
Yeah, we know all about--

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.590
There's a Feywild.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.170
MATT: "Well, let's just say I traveled

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.040
"briefly through a Feywild-like place

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.460
"as part of the trial that I failed and wound up here.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.060
"But I am from Exandria."

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.120
SAM: So you were on a different plane,

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.610
and then you got (whooshes) sent here?

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.060
MATT: "I believe so.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.680
"To be honest, those final moments are a bit foggy,

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.600
"not because of the magic,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.842
"but because I was losing consciousness rapidly.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.980
"Look, I have been interfacing with Vokodo myself personally

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.650
"since practically my arrival here.

"He is an extremely intelligent

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.566
"and an extremely greedy creature.

"He exhibits whatever power this is over the island,

"whether it's himself or he uses it to its will,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.898
"but as individuals forget themselves,

00:20:14.898 --> 00:20:18.862
"so comes the loyalty to Vokodo,

00:20:18.862 --> 00:20:20.240
"so it would not be a stretch of logic

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.448
"to think that they two are related."

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.980
TRAVIS: The last two and a half decades--

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.240
you seem to have a clear recollection

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.498
of your time before here. Do you remember the last

00:20:30.498 --> 00:20:33.480
two and a half decades in a different light?

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.620
MATT: "I remember them unclouded, yes."

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.490
TRAVIS: Do you know what this creature could be?

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.070
MATT: "I can't say I do.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.780
"I've studied quite a bit about the magics of nature,

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.150
"and a number of the strange

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.650
"elements of the world around us,

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.730
"but as one who has been to Pyrah

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.370
"and has seen the Fire Plane,

00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:00.362
"has immersed myself in the very nature of the flame,

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.000
"I have no idea what this Vokodo is."

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.610
LAURA: But you know he's not a god?

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.690
MATT: "I highly doubt it."

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.770
LAURA: He's not.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.890
MARISHA: Is there someone on the island who would know,

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.910
if we cleared their mind, too?

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.290
MATT: "I don't know."

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.970
SAM: Yes, I mean, you have to get off this island.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.428
Your mind could be turned again

00:21:26.428 --> 00:21:27.643
within days.
MATT: "We all have

00:21:27.643 --> 00:21:30.180
"to get off this island."

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.370
SAM: But we can't just leave all these people here.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.895
The V.O. community is extremely important to us.

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:39.400
(laughter)

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.267
Sorry, the Vo community is extremely important.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.720
LIAM: Wow.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.220
TRAVIS: You've seen, I'm sure--
MARISHA: Such a stretch.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.025
TRAVIS: -- challenges before against Vokodo.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.950
MATT: "Not directly, no."

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.630
TRAVIS: No one has challenged this creature?

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.810
MATT: "By the time they've come to him

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.450
"most of any reason they would've had

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.360
"to challenge him had faded."

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.210
TRAVIS: So you wouldn't know of any weaknesses

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.043
that he might have,

00:22:07.043 --> 00:22:11.130
things that they recoil from, or are sensitive to?

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.120
LAURA: Yeah, have you ever witnessed him go,

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.500
"Eugh," about anything,

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.850
or noticed that he has a butthole

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.330
or anything on the underside?

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:19.530
TRAVIS: A butthole?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.640
If you attack somebody in the butthole,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.822
it's instant. They have a reaction.

00:22:24.822 --> 00:22:26.070
SAM: Instant death.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.830
LAURA: Well, I wouldn't say it's instant death,

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.985
but it weakens them pretty hard.

00:22:30.985 --> 00:22:32.675
SAM: I'm going to remember that.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.675
MATT: Through the immense weight of this conversation,

00:22:37.675 --> 00:22:41.820
a chuckle does break through on Vilya's smile.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.319
They kind of--

00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:47.032
"There is wisdom in what you say.

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:51.332
(laughter)

00:22:51.332 --> 00:22:53.760
"Unfortunately--"
TRAVIS: Your butthole.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.610
MATT: "-- I cannot say that I've

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.760
"noticed such a--"

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.812
LAURA: Butthole.
MATT: "-- butthole on Vokodo.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.761
"There is a--"

00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:09.300
SAM: How does he go to the bathroom, then?

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.130
LAURA: He has to have one.
SAM: Yes, he must.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.640
Anyway, sorry, go on.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.207
Time is precious.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.110
MATT: "Precious things are, if anything,

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.693
"what would be a fault to this creature.

00:23:20.693 --> 00:23:23.210
"It's an obsession."
SAM: Oh, that's his greed.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.760
MATT: "And even since I've been here,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.090
"the island has been slowly changing."

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.498
MARISHA: In what way?

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:31.883
MATT: "And I've spoken with those

00:23:31.883 --> 00:23:32.780
"who've been here long before me,

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.300
"but there are shards of other places embedded here,

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:42.300
"like where re walked through, where I took you,

"that darkened area, that swamp-like space

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.930
"was not like that once,

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:51.260
"and from my knowledge, it's almost like an element

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.040
"of the Shadowfell has bled through in just that space."

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.850
LAURA: The Shadowfell!
SAM: What's that? What's that?

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.240
LAURA: No, I heard The Traveler talk about that one time.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.190
SAM: What is that? Is that a--

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.598
LAURA: I think it's scary or something.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.378
MARISHA: I would know what the

00:24:03.378 --> 00:24:04.485
Shadowfell is, right?
MATT: You would know.

00:24:04.485 --> 00:24:07.890
The both of you would have experience in this.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.560
"There's something about the presence of Vokodo,

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.230
"whether it's Vokodo's arrival

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.280
"or just living in this space that is slowly--"

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.480
MARISHA: Breaking down the barriers between planes?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.480
MATT: "Or at least is expanding the influence

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.190
"that these shards have had, as they've always been here.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.330
"The Ruins, these spots have always been here,

"they've just been slowly expanding."

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.530
ASHLEY: What do you mean by--
LAURA: Do you think, sorry.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.660
ASHLEY: -- expanding?

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.090
Just the--
MATT: "Just the--"

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.074
ASHLEY: -- darkness of it?
MATT: "The range."

00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:36.210
ASHLEY: The range of it.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.720
MATT: "The Ruin was once just a singular section

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.040
"with a few buildings that were left in rubble

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.570
"and one spire-like construct,

"and since then the trees around it

TALIESIN: The Heaven's Fall, have you been back since you--?

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.200
MATT: "Not directly.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.767
"It's forbidden by Vokodo to traverse them."

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:03.800
LAURA: That's his weak spot. It's his weak spot.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.030
MARISHA: We should go. Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.490
TALIESIN: I think it's a--
LIAM: Place to go.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.230
TALIESIN: Sounds like maybe that's how you got here, maybe--

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.750
MARISHA: Don't look at the man behind the curtain.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.890
TALIESIN: -- a little too--
TRAVIS: Ticket for seven.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.500
LIAM: That's why you showed up.
TALIESIN: Is that a water,

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.700
Water World?

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.880
MARISHA: Totally Water World.
TALIESIN: Or dimension.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.713
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:25:17.713 --> 00:25:20.750
ASHLEY: That actually could be the butthole.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.380
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, but the butthole--

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.720
SAM: It's the watery butthole.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.595
MARISHA: -- of Vo.

00:25:25.595 --> 00:25:28.190
Okay, so hang on then, because there's also--

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.440
SAM: Frothy.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.050
TRAVIS: The north--
MARISHA: -- the Winding Core,

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:32.883
the mining.

00:25:32.883 --> 00:25:34.550
SAM: There's the Winding Core---
LIAM: The Ruin.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.040
SAM: That's where there's mines and gems.
TRAVIS: They get all the jewels out, though.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.420
MATT: "There is a chasm that carves through the island

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.840
"from the northwest to the southeast beneath the mountain.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.860
"We, ourselves, only find safety

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.560
"in mining the southeast portion of it

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.710
"that's not terribly far from our village."

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.260
TRAVIS: What do you mean safely?
MATT: "<i>Our</i> village.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.985
"That feels weird to say now. (sighs)"

00:25:54.985 --> 00:25:56.800
LAURA: Do we have to free everyone else?

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.960
SAM: Of course we do.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.770
I mean, we have to try.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.520
TALIESIN: There's only so much we can do a day.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.486
I'm tapped out.

00:26:02.486 --> 00:26:03.580
TRAVIS: Well, and beyond that, I mean,

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.530
if this creature's been able to keep minds like this

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.930
tamed for two and a half decades

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.230
we need more than just us.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.700
We should get as many as we can.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.425
LIAM: How many are in Vo?

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.220
SAM: It's really hard to get into.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.267
MATT: "We have somewhere in the neighborhood--"

00:26:20.267 --> 00:26:23.934
(laughter)

00:26:23.934 --> 00:26:26.410
"Close to 120 villages of Vo total."

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.280
LAURA: Oh my god, we could potentially have more people

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.405
coming for Traveler Con

00:26:30.405 --> 00:26:32.805
than already are--
MATT: "How many?"

00:26:32.805 --> 00:26:35.020
LAURA: Maybe like, 200, maybe.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.260
LIAM: This is a bit of a pickle

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.770
for what you have in mind, Jester.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.840
SAM: Yes, we can--
MATT: "And what is to happen

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.310
"to them if they stay for a day, two days?"

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.593
LAURA: Well, I don't know! I didn't know that this could

00:26:45.593 --> 00:26:47.343
happen until just now!
MATT: "I know."

00:26:47.343 --> 00:26:50.948
LAURA: What if, oh, oh, I have an idea!

00:26:50.948 --> 00:26:53.040
What if we free as many people as we can

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.320
in the next couple days,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.510
we keep doing Greater Restorations, right, on everybody,

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.550
and then when everybody comes for Traveler Con,

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.970
we use all the people from the village that are free

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.850
as well as all of the new people

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.840
coming for Traveler Con,

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.230
and we just attack Guacamole.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:13.498
TALIESIN: What happens in two days when I forget who I am?

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:15.748
SAM: Also, how on earth would you--

00:27:15.748 --> 00:27:20.100
would we convince the 200 Traveler fans--

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.182
LAURA: <i>We</i> wouldn't.

00:27:22.182 --> 00:27:24.480
SAM and LAURA: The Traveler would.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.697
SAM: Okay, and so they're going to
arrive here for Traveler Con

00:27:26.697 --> 00:27:28.353
and Traveler's going to be like,

00:27:28.353 --> 00:27:30.580
"Welcome, first things first,

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.763
"let's go attack a lava god."
LAURA: Trial by fire!

00:27:32.763 --> 00:27:34.063
SAM: Ooh, okay.

00:27:34.063 --> 00:27:35.680
Has a nice ring to it.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.210
LIAM: We could also potentially magic away

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.510
all the people here in Vo,

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.640
but it is a trap for your friends who are coming.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.130
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.963
LIAM: I don't know.

00:27:46.963 --> 00:27:48.310
It seems like the numbers are against us,

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:52.970
so we either clear the island, fix the island,

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:57.536
fix Vokodo, or your 200

00:27:57.536 --> 00:28:01.269
or 300, however many it is,

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:04.670
risk not following The Traveler, but Vokodo.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.542
LAURA: Do you think it's possible to defeat...

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.785
(whispers) Guacamole?

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.505
MATT: "If he's not a god, then anything is possible.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.030
"As far as the idea of gathering individuals

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.210
"to help from within the village,

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.420
"there are able-bodied hunters,

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.350
"but the majority, the vast majority of our society

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.758
"are families, builders. They're not warriors.

00:28:32.758 --> 00:28:34.870
"There's a reason only I have been the one interfacing

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:37.190
"to make the various offerings,

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.350
"because as you've seen, the journey to get there

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.000
"is fraught with much peril,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.460
"and very few have the constitution and capability

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.110
"of surviving that journey."

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:50.110
TRAVIS: The other of your triumvirate,
Terra, the hunting leader,

00:28:50.782 --> 00:28:53.190
a fearsome warrior I would imagine, yes?

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.223
MATT: "Quite."

00:28:54.223 --> 00:28:58.406
LIAM: And your bear friends?
TRAVIS: So if we were to be picky with our

00:28:58.406 --> 00:29:01.872
restorations, perhaps they might be

00:29:01.872 --> 00:29:04.847
who we go after next?

00:29:04.847 --> 00:29:07.840
MATT: "I think Terra would be quite the asset

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.630
"if this is something you wish to pursue."

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.563
LAURA: You are quite powerful yourself, yes?

00:29:13.563 --> 00:29:16.690
MATT: "I have capabilities, but I have my limits as well.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.823
"My training was not complete."

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.040
TRAVIS: I worry about time.
LAURA: Traveler?

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.320
TRAVIS: Oh, are you going to make a collect call?

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.570
MARISHA: Yeah, well...

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:31.890
Before you talk to The Traveler,

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.635
could we talk to you?

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.370
You, Jester. Yeah, you.
LAURA: Me?

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.277
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: About what?

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:44.180
MARISHA: How did you get the vision

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.646
for a volcano island?

00:29:45.646 --> 00:29:49.030
How did you find out about Rumblecusp?

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:49.863
LAURA: Oh.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.710
MARISHA: The Traveler pointed you in this direction, right?

00:29:54.836 --> 00:29:56.210
LAURA: Yeah.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.573
I think so.

00:29:57.573 --> 00:30:00.002
I can't remember exactly.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.500
SAM: Did you pitch the idea of a volcano?

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.880
LAURA: I did pitch the idea ov a volcan-- of a vo--

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.713
Yes.

00:30:09.713 --> 00:30:11.332
I did.
TRAVIS: Oh vo vo.

00:30:11.332 --> 00:30:13.150
LAURA: (laughs nervously) I was thinking that volcano

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.691
that we were at with your family--
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:30:15.691 --> 00:30:16.850
LAURA: -- and then it was like,

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.130
well, maybe instead we should do something tropical

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.630
because that would be a nice vacay,

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:26.510
and then there was a tropical volcano.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.648
TALIESIN: I regret not putting
up more of a fight about that.

00:30:28.648 --> 00:30:30.692
SAM: I get what you're saying.

00:30:30.692 --> 00:30:33.810
If The Traveler somehow--
MARISHA: Knows what's going on.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.260
SAM: -- pushed us here, perhaps he knows--

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.220
MARISHA: If he influenced this entire decision.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.200
Didn't you say he wanted to be less busy?

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.940
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.420
He's trying to offload followers.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.490
MARISHA: What if he's trying to
legitimately offload followers?

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.570
We joked about that yesterday or something, I don't know,

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.670
but what if this is all part of his plan?

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.452
He's The Traveler.

00:30:58.692 --> 00:31:01.090
He has to know something weird

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.520
is going on in this place, right?

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.228
LAURA: Well yeah, I mean, I told him that it's weird.

00:31:06.228 --> 00:31:08.120
He knows.
SAM: Did he seem surprised?

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.327
LAURA: He was like, "Oh, seems weird." I don't know.

00:31:11.327 --> 00:31:13.320
TRAVIS: Do you think there's any chance that he would,

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.460
I don't know, materialize again and help us

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.268
in a (clicks) assault against--

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.253
LAURA: I--
TRAVIS: -- Vovo.

00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:24.155
LAURA: -- could ask him to do that.

00:31:24.155 --> 00:31:26.360
SAM: Time is tight.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.610
We've been here one night already, correct?

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.350
MATT: You have.
SAM: This is day two,

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.440
and now it's turning into evening.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.800
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: It is.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.750
SAM: Woof.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:38.600
MATT: And Vilya at this point pipes up and goes,

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.910
"From the experiences I've had,

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:44.910
"usually the first night is not terribly eventful,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.930
"but it begins to quickly take hold after that."

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.130
MARISHA: Well, you know--
SAM: And you two

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.840
Caduceus and Jester, you both have the ability to undo this?

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.990
LAURA: Well, I will have the ability tomorrow.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.520
SAM: If you remember.
TALIESIN: Twice.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.845
LAURA: Yeah, I just have to, you know,

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.550
talk to The Traveler and pick what I want to do for the day.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.900
TRAVIS: How many total, between you two?

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.120
Three or two?
TALIESIN: Good question.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.430
LAURA: It's a 5th-level.
MARISHA: It's an expensive spell.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.010
LAURA: So I can do two.
TALIESIN: Wait, hold on.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:19.690
SAM: And you, Viridi, Vilya--
LAURA: Three, technically.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:20.523
TALIESIN: Three.
SAM: Do you have

00:32:20.523 --> 00:32:24.620
this magical ability that they used?

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.630
MATT: "I believe I do have access to it, yes."

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.030
SAM: Okay, okay, so if we wake
up tomorrow and one of us is--

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.900
TRAVIS: <i>If</i> we wake up tomorrow.
LAURA: What if it's all of us?

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.830
TALIESIN: What if it's the two of us?

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:39.028
TRAVIS: ♪ Just the two of us. ♪
MARISHA: Well, you know,

00:32:39.028 --> 00:32:39.861
Vilya, we've been doing this--

00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:41.590
SAM: Would you prefer we kill you and leave you here,

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.210
or just leave you alive?

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.780
TRAVIS: No, we're not doing that.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.860
ASHLEY: Well, we could sleep in shifts, maybe,

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.930
and each of you could take a shift--

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:54.807
LIAM: Also, for the record, if we want to leave tomorrow

00:32:54.807 --> 00:32:56.414
we can leave.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.740
SAM: That's true.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.040
LIAM: But you have a lot of work to do.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:03.880
I suppose it depends largely

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.690
on what it is you want here, Jester.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.498
We have come here for you.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:13.467
LAURA: Well, The Traveler's depending on me.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.260
LIAM: Do you think there is any validity

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.500
to Beauregard's theory?

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.590
TALIESIN: What happens if we sleep on the ship?

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:27.240
LAURA: Well, I mean, you know, we talked about it,

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.080
me and The Traveler talked about him

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.588
wanting to have less followers.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:35.853
You know.

00:33:39.096 --> 00:33:42.388
I don't know if he knows.

00:33:42.388 --> 00:33:43.810
I don't know if he knew.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.910
LIAM: What do you want?

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:48.560
You've always said you want The Traveler to be a god.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.800
LAURA: Well, not if he doesn't want that.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.410
LIAM: Difficult.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:02.118
MARISHA: Can we all still name our
parents and where we came from?

00:34:02.118 --> 00:34:03.784
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'd know if we did that.
MARISHA: Can we still do that?

00:34:03.784 --> 00:34:05.250
TALIESIN: We did that--

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.360
SAM: Yeah, we are.
MARISHA: We did it earlier,

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.910
but can we do it now?
TRAVIS: Caleb,

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.510
how long did it take us to get here from the village?

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.810
LIAM: Precisely-- I don't know.

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.110
Was it like, a day?

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.160
MATT: It was about...

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:17.993
Let me look at my paper again,

00:34:17.993 --> 00:34:20.070
it was roughly six to eight hours

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:22.160
to get from Vo to where you are here.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.640
TRAVIS: The problem is, the idea of going back

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.830
and getting reinforcements,

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:30.230
whether it's Terra, Lukash, or the were-bear people,

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.600
it's going to take time.
SAM: It's going to take a day.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.539
TRAVIS: Might be worse.

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:38.375
MATT: "Anybody have any means of traversing over?

00:34:38.375 --> 00:34:39.970
"I've seen some of you--"
LAURA: Flying?

00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:41.370
SAM: Yes, yes.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.918
LAURA: I can fly.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:34:43.918 --> 00:34:45.000
TRAVIS: A few of us.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.070
Not me.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.430
MATT: "'Cause if we--"
TRAVIS: Keep watch.

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:51.170
MATT: "If we can bypass having to go through the jungle,

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.625
"that will significantly decrease

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.700
"the time we require to get there."

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.780
SAM: And we would be going there

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:02.590
to get an ally or two to do what?

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.860
TRAVIS: To come help us fight this--

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.768
SAM: We're just going to go in there and like,

00:35:06.768 --> 00:35:08.293
(punches) fight?

00:35:08.293 --> 00:35:09.510
Or should we go to this Falls first?

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.870
MARISHA: I agree with Veth. I think we need more information

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.330
on what's going on here.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.460
LIAM: I think we want to go where Vokodo wants us not to go.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.110
MARISHA: I agree.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.520
SAM: The butthole.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.850
TRAVIS: The chain--
MARISHA: If someone says

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.870
"Don't go to the butthole," that's the first place to go.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.561
LAURA: Well, not necessarily, no.

00:35:26.561 --> 00:35:29.124
You should respect it if they don't want to.

00:35:29.124 --> 00:35:31.270
LIAM: Are we still talking about the same thing?

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.300
MARISHA: I don't know anymore.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.705
Oh god, it's starting.
ASHLEY: You're forgetting.

00:35:34.705 --> 00:35:36.530
(laughter)

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.940
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.240
What are buttholes for?

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.240
MATT: Vilya does say, "The places that are forbidden,

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.170
"from Vokodo's standpoint at least,

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:49.527
"are the Heaven's Falls

00:35:49.527 --> 00:35:53.800
"and the Ruin for protective reasoning.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.260
"I think those are the only primary places

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.939
"that are considered limited."
ASHLEY: That's where we have to go.

00:35:58.939 --> 00:36:03.100
TALIESIN: Which of those two has decent beach access?

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.633
(laughter)
TRAVIS: What?

00:36:05.633 --> 00:36:07.541
MARISHA: Yeah, so we can sleep on the ship.
TALIESIN: I've got an idea.

00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:08.449
SAM: Beachfront property.

00:36:08.449 --> 00:36:09.710
MARISHA: We go. We--

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.010
I know where you're going.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.350
We go, we investigate, we finish our investigation,

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.500
we have Orly pick us up on the beach,

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.090
we sail out by a few hundred meters,

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.453
and we sleep on the ship tonight.

00:36:20.453 --> 00:36:22.019
TALIESIN: Or we sleep on the ship tonight

00:36:22.019 --> 00:36:23.080
and then sail it over there.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.640
LAURA: Or, we cast Breathe Underwater on all of us

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.710
and then we go sleep in the water,

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.080
and we don't need a ship.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.500
TALIESIN: Unless we get attacked by a giant--

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.280
TRAVIS: Also, the Heaven's stair,

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.600
yeah, Heaven's Falls, isn't it quite a journey?

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.800
MATT: "From here,

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.340
"if by wing, not quite as far,

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.258
"but on foot from where we stand now,

00:36:46.258 --> 00:36:47.200
"if we go along the mountain

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.010
"we could probably get there in about six hours,

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:52.090
"but it's a perilous journey to hike along the--"

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:53.600
TRAVIS: By foot it's six hours?

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.720
MATT: "By foot alongside the mountain, yes.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.800
"If we're going through the jungle

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.130
"we're looking at the better part of a day, 10 to 12."

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.330
TALIESIN: And I'm pretty tapped.
TRAVIS: Clock is ticking

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:03.163
on the thing that--

00:37:03.163 --> 00:37:06.764
MATT: "By flight, maybe three."
TRAVIS: -- our memory not being affected, so.

00:37:06.764 --> 00:37:08.340
MARISHA: Yeah, can we--

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.660
How are we feeling?

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.190
Are we feeling?
TRAVIS: Little unsettled,

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:14.620
a little poopy happening.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.830
MARISHA: Marisha's asking the DM how are we feeling?

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.110
Are we starting to feel foggy on things,

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.022
are we like--
MATT: No.

00:37:22.022 --> 00:37:24.249
MARISHA: No? Okay.
TRAVIS: How are the colors right now?

00:37:24.249 --> 00:37:25.830
(laughter)

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.320
TALIESIN: Are you there, DM? It's me, Marisha.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.410
MARISHA: Is it?
LIAM: Sound.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.455
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:37:29.455 --> 00:37:31.660
MATT: This might help you actually
get a little bit of a visual.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.813
LAURA: Hey!

00:37:33.813 --> 00:37:35.705
SAM: Can you touch it?
TRAVIS: Throw.

00:37:35.705 --> 00:37:37.232
SAM: Can you touch it?
LIAM: Oh.

00:37:37.232 --> 00:37:38.065
MATT: That kind of worked.

00:37:38.065 --> 00:37:38.910
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Kind of worked.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.120
TALIESIN: I like the idea of going

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.310
as far away from this place as possible tonight,

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.170
sleeping and then coming back in the morning.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.180
SAM: It's pretty cool.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.020
LAURA: Yeah, text us a picture.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.844
Take a picture of it and text it.

00:37:48.844 --> 00:37:49.677
MATT: Thank you, Deven.

00:37:49.677 --> 00:37:51.302
SAM: Oh, that's a Deven Rue?
MATT: Yeah.

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:55.010
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's very cool.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.843
MARISHA: I agree, though.

00:37:55.843 --> 00:37:57.946
I don't think we can fight this thing yet

00:37:57.946 --> 00:37:59.612
until we have more information on what it does.

00:37:59.612 --> 00:38:01.080
MATT: I could put it right over here,

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.150
in front of the table, if you want to.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.983
SAM: Travvy.

00:38:02.983 --> 00:38:04.230
TRAVIS: Huh?
MATT: If you want to hand me that, I can--

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.068
throw it back, I can put it
right in the middle of the table.

00:38:06.068 --> 00:38:07.168
SAM: We'll see it on these little--

00:38:07.168 --> 00:38:08.493
MATT: Look at that.
LAURA: Hey!

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:11.600
TALIESIN: Well, that's convenient.
LAURA and LIAM: Ooh.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.720
MATT: There we go.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.660
So this is the main mountain.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.790
You guys are currently about there,

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:20.520
on the western side, a little ways up the mountain base.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.540
The village of Vo is about here.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.871
LAURA: Oh, that makes sense.

00:38:23.871 --> 00:38:26.000
MATT: The Falls are in the shadow

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.320
on this side of the island, right there.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.330
So you can go along the mountain this way,

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:32.520
which is the shorter route on foot,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.510
but it's perilous to go along the rocky mountainside

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.343
down to the falls,

00:38:36.343 --> 00:38:37.700
or you can go all the way through the jungle,

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.150
which takes a lot longer,

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.010
or if you can find a way to get everyone to do it,

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.907
you can fly there, but that's...

00:38:42.907 --> 00:38:44.883
Depends on what you guys have at your disposal.
TALIESIN: Or we can fly to the ship.

00:38:44.883 --> 00:38:48.360
SAM: A few of us can fly, and you can, too. Right, Vilya?

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.370
MATT: "I can.

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.777
"I can carry one person at most.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.380
"We could probably carry more than one,

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.600
"but that's going to be challenging,

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.293
"and failure there could have some grave consequences."

00:39:00.293 --> 00:39:02.940
LAURA: I can carry two people.
LIAM: Same.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.560
SAM: That's everybody.
LAURA: Maybe two plus,

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.710
like Veth, you could be on my back, maybe.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.610
LIAM: Where are we saying the butthole is?

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.330
In the shadow of those two rocky crags on that side?

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.750
MATT: Right here.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.120
SAM: It's in that dark place there.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.360
LAURA: Where are the Ruins at?
LIAM: Where the sun don't shine.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.720
MATT: The Ruins are up

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.570
in the center of this open space here.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:26.570
LAURA: Ooh, the complete other direction.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:28.430
I want to see the Ruins too, though.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:30.380
LIAM: I want to see the Ruins.
TALIESIN: What's that

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.300
seemingly separated island off the corner?

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.800
TRAVIS: The upper right hand corner?

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.310
MATT: "I do not know."
ASHLEY: Looks like a little face.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:41.300
LIAM: And DM, Liam asking, Vilya said that Vokodo

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.920
doesn't like people visiting the Ruins, or--

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.753
LAURA: Both.

00:39:45.753 --> 00:39:46.890
SAM: And Heaven Falls.
LIAM: Heaven Falls.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.170
MATT: Both, yes.
LIAM: Okay.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:49.600
And where was the Ruins again?

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.070
Not in the shadow. There.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:52.920
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.670
I think I-
MARISHA: But Vilya came in

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.500
through the Heavens, the Falls.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.323
That's where Vilya came in?
MATT: That's where she believes.

00:40:00.323 --> 00:40:02.500
She was found near there, yes.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.180
SAM: So we need to message Orly

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.130
to get the ship around to the other side,

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.510
we need to sleep with some sort of plan

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:15.510
in case all of us are mind melted overnight.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.310
LAURA: Why can't we Breathe Underwater,

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.310
swim to the bottom, you use your thingy

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:24.210
so nothing can get in, and then we sleep underwater

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.360
beneath the ship?
SAM: Isn't it night time now?

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.680
MATT: Yes, at this point in time it's pushing close

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.780
to like, nine, 10 o'clock.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:33.960
SAM: We would have to hike or fly for hours in the dark

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.500
to get to water.
TALIESIN: Or maybe it's safer

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.030
on that other island, I don't know.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.140
MARISHA: I don't know if I trust

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.500
another uncharted island right now.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.980
TALIESIN: Or back on the boat.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.210
My vote's for back on the boat.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:48.010
MARISHA: We've got a perfectly comfortable boat.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.150
SAM: You can't teleport us today, can you?

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.000
LIAM: I cannot teleport us to the boat.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.060
I could teleport us to a city we know.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.060
MARISHA: But we could fly to the boat.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.640
LIAM: Yeah.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.490
MARISHA: Let's fly to the boat.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:02.530
LAURA: Okay.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.470
MARISHA: And then we can sail around to Heaven's Falls

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.700
and check it out in the morning.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.380
SAM: That would take hours and hours.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.220
MARISHA: We can rest.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.150
MATT: "So you have the capability

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:15.438
"of carrying the entirety of your party through flight?"

00:41:15.438 --> 00:41:17.490
SAM: I think so.
LAURA: You can fly right now?

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:20.280
I thought you couldn't fly earlier, Caleb?

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.620
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Minus one, we need--

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.643
LIAM: I can fly.
SAM: -- you to carry someone.

00:41:22.643 --> 00:41:25.688
LAURA: But that's why we didn't fly earlier.

00:41:25.688 --> 00:41:28.530
LIAM: I was an owl earlier, wasn't I?

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:30.853
LAURA: Oh.

00:41:30.853 --> 00:41:33.120
LIAM: I don't have the Fly spell.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.510
LAURA: Oh, but you could turn into something

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.750
that could carry one person.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.200
I could turn into--
LIAM: Two.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.210
LAURA: Okay, yeah, then we should be able to do it, yeah.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:41.250
MATT: "All right, that's that then.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.270
"I can carry one at most."
LAURA: Okay, good.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.080
Yeah, we should be good.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.440
MATT: "Oh, well that'll make it far easier

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.030
"to get to these destinations then.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:51.410
"That would've been helpful before we made the trek."

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.285
TALIESIN: I say we fly tonight to the boat.

00:41:54.285 --> 00:41:55.350
I don't want to sleep here.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.880
MARISHA: What time is it, Caleb?

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.200
LIAM: It's getting close to--
TRAVIS: Nine-ish.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.900
MATT: Let's say 9:30, 10:00pm.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.991
You know exactly.

00:42:01.991 --> 00:42:03.650
9:53.
LIAM: Thanks.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:04.660
TALIESIN: It's going to be a late night.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.290
We'll sleep in.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.540
If we can collect the crew

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.450
they can sail their way to the other side

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:10.930
maybe while we sleep.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.620
LAURA: Oh my gosh, yeah, the crew.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.050
LIAM: I chose Keen Mind and Identify

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.240
so we'd always know what's up.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.030
MATT: Yeah, it's great.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:19.230
LAURA: All right.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.020
TRAVIS: We're going back to the boat?

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.210
SAM: How long would it take-- Captain?

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:25.200
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.760
SAM: How long, in your esteemed nautical mind,

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.500
would it take us to sail 'round the island.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.160
TRAVIS: Such knowledge can only be gained

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.960
after years upon the sea,

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.130
the wind in your face, the brine in your gums.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.260
I have no clue, no idea.
SAM: Two hours?

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.260
Three?

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.330
Five?

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.570
A day?

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:45.630
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, if I had to guess it

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:48.375
based off of the other big ole map--

00:42:48.375 --> 00:42:50.366
LIAM: Do you have your binder?

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.503
LAURA: Matt knows.

00:42:53.503 --> 00:42:55.590
TRAVIS: Maybe like, three hours?
MATT: What are you asking?

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.830
TRAVIS: To go around the island at 35 miles per hour.

00:42:58.830 --> 00:42:59.750
SAM: 35?

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.660
That's how fast we can go?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.134
SAM: Damn!
TRAVIS: Sorry.

00:43:03.134 --> 00:43:03.967
LAURA: No.
TRAVIS: No.

00:43:03.967 --> 00:43:05.418
Is it 35 feet per second?

00:43:05.418 --> 00:43:08.770
MATT: No, on the ship you mean?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:13.730
MATT: No, you're looking at, pace would be about three--

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.790
Sailing ship should be about two to three miles an hour.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.410
TRAVIS: 35 miles an hour.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.740
LAURA: So it's probably three to five miles an hour, maybe.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.230
TALIESIN: And how big is the, I'm not--

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.470
TRAVIS: Four miles per hour.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.420
TALIESIN: How big is the island across?

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.830
How many miles across is it approximately?

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.780
MATT: You don't know.
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:33.950
LIAM: What if there was another boat

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.386
going in the opposite direction.

00:43:35.386 --> 00:43:37.175
ASHLEY: That is a fast fantasy boat.

00:43:37.175 --> 00:43:38.957
(laughter)

00:43:38.957 --> 00:43:41.020
TALIESIN: A speedboat.

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.200
TRAVIS: Magic, you guys.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.560
LAURA: So yeah, let's fly.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.190
SAM: So we're going to fly at night to the boat?

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.610
LAURA: What else are we--
TALIESIN: No, that's fine.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:49.590
TALIESIN: And let the crew know to get ready.

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:50.423
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:50.423 --> 00:43:52.843
Oh, I'll send a message to Orly right now.

00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:58.390
Hey, Orly! We're going to come back

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:00.270
to the boat and sleep tonight.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.351
Get the crew on there, it's important to do that.

00:44:04.351 --> 00:44:06.880
(laughter)

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.420
Also, we're kind of hungry.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.732
SAM: (laughs) Oh, nice, you ordered in.

00:44:11.732 --> 00:44:12.573
LAURA: Yeah.

00:44:12.573 --> 00:44:13.606
MATT: Okay.

00:44:13.606 --> 00:44:15.331
Orly responds,

00:44:16.231 --> 00:44:18.331
"Understood.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.128
"Slight issue.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:24.668
"We don't have a boat."

00:44:24.668 --> 00:44:25.850
ASHLEY and MARISHA: (gasps)

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.590
SAM: Ooh, this would be a commercial break.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.797
MARISHA: Fuck!
(laughter)

00:44:33.797 --> 00:44:37.034
Oh no.
TALIESIN: We have a ship.

00:44:37.034 --> 00:44:40.817
MATT: "Myself and the crew

00:44:40.817 --> 00:44:42.475
"are in the village."

00:44:42.475 --> 00:44:43.392
LAURA: Oh.

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:48.040
MARISHA: Was it the dragon turtle?

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.171
MATT: That's all he responded with.

00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:50.020
MARISHA: Fuck.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.520
TRAVIS: Ask him what the fuck happened.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.310
LIAM: Yeah, you got one more in you, Jester.

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:55.670
LAURA: Okay.

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:57.760
What the fuck happened?!

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.931
Was it the dragon turtle?

00:44:59.931 --> 00:45:03.870
Was it Vo...kodo?

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.780
MARISHA: Does he remember where he parked it?

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:06.840
Maybe he just forgot.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.540
LAURA: Did it sail away without you?

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.731
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:45:10.731 --> 00:45:12.195
(laughter)

00:45:12.195 --> 00:45:13.261
LAURA: Orly!

00:45:14.291 --> 00:45:15.574
Okay, well.

00:45:15.574 --> 00:45:19.524
(laughter)

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:24.860
MATT: "We set up camp like you requested,

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.026
"but

00:45:27.026 --> 00:45:29.509
"nope, it was the dragon turtle.

00:45:29.509 --> 00:45:32.420
(laughter)

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:35.970
"Heard a terrifying crunch sound,

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:40.170
"and watched her sink."

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.872
ASHLEY: Oh no.
LAURA: Shit.

00:45:42.872 --> 00:45:44.970
TALIESIN: Okay, so.
LAURA: We have to kill him now

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.304
because if we don't we're going to be stuck here forever.

00:45:48.304 --> 00:45:49.503
SAM: Well, <i>we</i> won't.

00:45:49.503 --> 00:45:52.187
LAURA: Well, they will. We can't get everybody out.

00:45:52.187 --> 00:45:53.910
ASHLEY: We told them to stay, to get off of the boat

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:56.830
and sleep on the beach.
TRAVIS: The beach.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:58.228
(laughter)

00:45:58.228 --> 00:45:59.140
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.328
SAM: Whatcha got there, Yasha?

00:46:00.328 --> 00:46:02.193
ASHLEY: I have a cookie.
TALIESIN: Maybe underwater.

00:46:02.193 --> 00:46:03.995
(laughter)

00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:06.666
ASHLEY: I think that's what this is.
TALIESIN: Underwater or that other island?

00:46:06.666 --> 00:46:08.850
LAURA: Huh?
TALIESIN: Underwater or that other island.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.890
LAURA: Underwater, we should sleep underwater.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:12.380
SAM: Whoa, what?

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.590
How does that even work?

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.560
We'll float away, there's currents.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.960
LIAM: Our main escape route is gone,

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.940
and we're not going to just have me

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.130
help us abandon everyone who's on the island

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.400
that is like Vilya was, so we need to commit

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.310
to whatever we're doing here.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.460
And we're not going to be able to save all those people.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.340
We don't have any backup now, there is no boat.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.648
So I think we need to--

00:46:36.648 --> 00:46:39.417
TRAVIS: Go forward.
LIAM: Go to the butthole.

00:46:39.417 --> 00:46:41.560
LAURA: Tonight?
TRAVIS: Go to the dark place in between.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.070
LIAM: We should--

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.980
LAURA: Go try to sleep tonight?
LIAM: We should, yeah.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.390
But your ideas--
MARISHA: In between. (laughs)

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:51.778
LIAM: Both are good. Well, there is no boat, so your idea,

00:46:51.778 --> 00:46:53.991
it's a good one, we sleep underwater.

00:46:53.991 --> 00:46:54.882
LAURA: Caleb agrees with me!

00:46:54.882 --> 00:46:55.715
Caleb agrees with me!

00:46:55.715 --> 00:46:56.790
He said I was smart!
SAM: How would that work?

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:59.780
We have to tether ourselves together to an anchor,

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.710
and how, I mean, what?

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:02.510
MARISHA: Yeah, will we float to the top of the dome

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.030
and just kind of like

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:05.510
sleep in the dome?

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.770
TRAVIS: The dome doesn't really keep you from leaving.

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:10.363
LAURA: So we tie ourselves in.

00:47:10.363 --> 00:47:14.190
TRAVIS: Hmm, this seems unnecessarily complicated.

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:17.870
SAM: We could just sleep in shifts.
TALIESIN: I just thought of a--

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:20.220
What are we going to breathe in the dome?

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.053
LIAM: Water.

00:47:21.053 --> 00:47:22.750
MARISHA: Well, he was saying we cast Water Breathing.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:23.720
TALIESIN: How long does it last for?

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.264
MARISHA: Eight hours.
SAM: A day.

00:47:25.264 --> 00:47:27.193
LAURA: 24 hours.
MARISHA: Oh, 24 hours.

00:47:27.193 --> 00:47:28.720
LAURA: Does it keep concentration when you're sleeping?

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.040
Yes, it does!

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.193
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:47:31.193 --> 00:47:32.168
That work for everybody?

00:47:32.168 --> 00:47:33.648
TRAVIS: Does it?

00:47:33.648 --> 00:47:34.564
LAURA: Does it?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:47:34.564 --> 00:47:35.955
MATT: It is not concentration.
MARISHA: My concern, is we don't--

00:47:35.955 --> 00:47:36.950
LAURA: Oh good.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:38.400
MARISHA: Just because we're underwater

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.280
doesn't mean we're out of the range

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.570
of the island's influence of whatever it is.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.760
We've got to be far enough away from this.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.190
Underwater isn't going to stop us from the vibe.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:53.191
LAURA: Well, then our only option is

00:47:53.191 --> 00:47:55.420
Caleb, you teleport us out

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.800
and then tomorrow morning we teleport back in.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.780
LIAM: That's--

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.410
SAM: You can't teleport back.
LIAM: That's difficult.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.680
LAURA: Teleport us to Essek and he can teleport us back in.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.213
SAM: Oh my god, we're going to travel
5,000 miles just to sleep?

00:48:06.213 --> 00:48:08.527
(laughter)

00:48:08.527 --> 00:48:09.700
LAURA: Or we forget who we are

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.590
and we stay here forever.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:12.580
TALIESIN: If there was a way to counteract it, maybe.

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.750
Do we know how it works, or is it just--

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:17.320
SAM: Odds are not all three of you

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.500
will forget your memory tonight.

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.850
Is there something that we can do

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:25.380
to ensure that you'll be strong of will,

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.320
constitution overnight?

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.930
TRAVIS: Have you seen Caduceus' dexterity checks lately?

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.313
He's going to forget who he is.
LIAM: Vilya.

00:48:31.313 --> 00:48:33.379
TALIESIN: I'm going to forget how to
walk at the rate of this.

00:48:33.379 --> 00:48:35.970
LIAM: Do you know, does this phenomenon

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:38.480
come with sleep specifically?

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.113
LAURA: Were there signs that it was happening?

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.840
MATT: "Commonly it would be upon waking

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.580
"that memories would fade."

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.430
LAURA: And it would happen completely overnight,

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:51.020
or it would be like, you'd wake up and be like,

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.730
"Oh no, I'm starting to forget some stuff,"

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.070
and then the next day--

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.570
MATT: "It would be somewhat gradual.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:00.310
"Within a few days it would all be gone.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:04.360
"But large sections would leave with each morning

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.768
"that one was not prepared."

00:49:09.405 --> 00:49:10.740
TALIESIN: Do you remember how to do things?

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.438
Or do you just forget why you would do them?

00:49:14.438 --> 00:49:16.150
Do you feel like you lost--
MATT: "More that.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.800
"No, I could still use my capabilities,

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.570
"the skills, the things that were not inherent

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:25.340
"to my personal experiences, to my relationships,

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.670
"to my sense of identity, those stayed,

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.910
"everything else just went away."

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:34.810
LIAM: Well, this is very much the same as common amnesia.

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:38.770
You do not lose your total sense of self.

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:41.400
MATT: "It's engineered to keep you from leaving."

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.850
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly.

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:43.958
MATT: "You're still useful."

00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:45.308
MARISHA: You're still a tool.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:47.323
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

00:49:47.323 --> 00:49:49.690
TRAVIS: So are we going to the Heaven's Falls,

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:51.420
or are we going to get Terra first

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.970
and then the Heaven's Falls?

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:54.070
LAURA: I think the village.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.077
SAM: I vote Heaven Falls.

00:49:58.077 --> 00:50:00.340
TRAVIS: There's always a chance that if we try to get Terra

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.420
the other villagers might not let them go.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.140
SAM: There's a chance that Terra won't want to go.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.273
LAURA: Oh god.

00:50:08.325 --> 00:50:12.760
LIAM: I'm more of the inclination
that we stick to ourselves.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.470
MARISHA: Do we want to try and investigate this other island

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.180
that's fairly uncharted,

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.590
or do we think that that's--

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.447
TRAVIS: It's pretty far, pretty far.

00:50:20.447 --> 00:50:22.020
MARISHA: Well, if we're flying.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.220
SAM: But also, we know the places

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.320
that we need to investigate: the Ruins,

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:30.025
the Heaven Falls. We don't need to
add a third place that's--

00:50:30.025 --> 00:50:32.960
MARISHA: If it's just far enough away from Vokodo--

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.420
TALIESIN: I feel like he would send people there

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.990
if it were still under his influence.

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:41.020
Maybe it's just too far so he doesn't bother mining it.

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.670
MARISHA: Right, it's out of his
radius, maybe it's far enough.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.090
LAURA: Why don't we land near Heaven Falls?

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:49.090
Because we won't be able to fly

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:51.790
for that long without landing.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:55.250
My ability to fly will only last an hour at a time.

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:56.840
MARISHA: Get to Heaven Falls and then go from there?

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.673
LAURA: Yeah.

00:50:57.673 --> 00:50:59.000
Maybe Caleb can send Frumpkin

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.550
and scout out the other island.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:04.280
MATT: "If we're carrying as many figures

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.860
"as we're discussing in these forms,

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.830
"we're not going to be able to travel at full speed either,

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:11.290
"so if you can only keep this for an hour,

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.270
"be mindful of the time you have."

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.390
LAURA: Yeah.

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:15.920
I'll be reliant on you, Caleb.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.061
As soon as you start to land I will, too, okay?

00:51:18.061 --> 00:51:18.919
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:18.919 --> 00:51:20.690
TALIESIN: I'll fly with you as well

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:23.410
so we split up the healers.

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:24.720
TRAVIS: Let's do it.
MARISHA: Let's go.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.552
TRAVIS: I feel the need.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:51:26.552 --> 00:51:29.000
TRAVIS: The need for speed.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.710
SAM: Did you just make that up?

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.360
TRAVIS: How'd you like it?
SAM: It was good.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.250
LAURA: It was good.
SAM: It was.

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:34.886
ASHLEY: It really kind of rhymes.
TALIESIN: You should write that down.

00:51:34.886 --> 00:51:36.407
MARISHA: Canon!

00:51:36.407 --> 00:51:38.630
LIAM: If I'm carrying Caduceus,

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:40.230
one of you will need to carry Yasha.

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.308
I can't take that much weight.
LAURA: I can carry Yasha.

00:51:42.308 --> 00:51:44.830
ASHLEY: You can? Okay.

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:49.210
LAURA: And you should carry Fjord.
MATT: "All right."

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:52.470
LAURA: And then Beau and Veth.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.476
LIAM: They're both pretty--
LAURA and LIAM: Light.

00:51:54.476 --> 00:51:56.260
LAURA: So we'll, yeah.

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.093
SAM: Who are we going?

00:51:57.093 --> 00:51:58.490
We're going with Caleb?

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.310
LIAM: I'll take you and Caduceus.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.440
LAURA: I'll take you and Yasha.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.570
TALIESIN: That's the plan.
TRAVIS: Just like you do.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:05.890
MATT: "All right."
MARISHA: Rock.

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:07.170
TRAVIS: Who's leading?

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:09.050
Who's in the--? Okay.

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:10.650
LAURA: Well.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.220
MATT: "I'll lead."

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.857
TRAVIS: I'm ready when you are.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.420
MATT: You watch as Vilya stands up for a second,

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.020
and you guys are about 15 feet

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.350
in from the mouth of the cave,

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:25.770
and you watch as she stands up and (sighs)

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:27.620
takes a breath and looks out

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.860
wistfully into the dark,

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:30.970
the pitch black, lightless night,

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:34.480
the void that exists beyond the barely-lit mouth

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.480
of the cavern you guys sit within.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.080
She takes a couple of steps,

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.310
speeds up, and as she runs

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.470
and looks like she's about to leap out of the hole,

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:46.280
you watch, (whooshes) she transforms once again,

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.600
wings extending out

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.520
and loops out into the shadow.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.350
MARISHA: Catch her Fjord, that's a run and jump.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:53.450
Go, go.
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think she forgot.

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:56.370
MATT: Before looping back around.
(laughter)

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:59.658
LIAM: Wow, she really just left without all of us.

00:52:59.658 --> 00:53:01.110
Wasn't expecting that.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:02.518
TALIESIN: And she's gone.

00:53:02.518 --> 00:53:03.920
MATT: In a giant owl form,

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.672
you see the familiar dark brown,

00:53:08.672 --> 00:53:13.240
textured, massive owl form now
waiting at the exterior of the cavern.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:16.874
TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:53:16.874 --> 00:53:18.960
I don't know how to best do this.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.660
Do I just offer an arm, or--?
LAURA: Both arms out.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.930
TRAVIS: Like this?

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:24.540
LAURA: Yeah, so she can grab you.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.173
TALIESIN: Yeah, that looks--

00:53:26.173 --> 00:53:28.242
LAURA: That looks uncomfortable.

00:53:28.242 --> 00:53:29.533
That's got to suck.

00:53:29.533 --> 00:53:30.890
TRAVIS: (hooting)

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:32.690
MATT: You walk out towards her?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:34.860
MATT: As you approach,

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.090
the owl (whooshes) disappears into the shadow.

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:40.143
TRAVIS: What?

00:53:40.143 --> 00:53:42.140
MATT: (whooshes) Suddenly from above

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.050
these two large talons just grasp

00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:44.930
both sides of your arms

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:47.690
and your feet are just kicking off into air.

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:48.898
TRAVIS: No, no! Slower!

00:53:48.898 --> 00:53:50.472
Slower!

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.640
MATT: There's a rush of wind and darkness.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.180
You now can look up and you can see

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:59.642
a little bit of the moon, or specifically Catha,

00:53:59.642 --> 00:54:01.690
and Ruidus is barely visible behind you that way,

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:04.030
and there are stars and bits of sparse clouds,

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:05.970
and it is just wind rushing past,

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:07.710
and it is a wild sensation.

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:09.267
Your stomach drops.

00:54:09.267 --> 00:54:10.560
TRAVIS: Got to talk about your nails.

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.340
MATT: Immediate sweat.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.350
It's intense.
TRAVIS: (hyperventilating)

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:15.590
LAURA: We should go.

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:18.030
LIAM: Well, when in Vo, hmm?

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:19.530
TALIESIN: Doing the airplane.

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:20.930
TRAVIS: Yovo.

00:54:21.835 --> 00:54:24.560
ASHLEY: "Yovo."
LIAM: I grab my two and follow.

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.077
MATT: All right.

00:54:26.077 --> 00:54:29.176
LAURA: Same. Giant owl

00:54:29.176 --> 00:54:32.480
with navy, inky feathers.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.780
MATT: Okay, okay.

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.162
LIAM: I am my typical dirty brown.

00:54:36.162 --> 00:54:38.760
(laughter)

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.570
MATT: Grasping onto your group,

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:44.670
it is a heavy load to bear,

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.690
even with the size of these creatures

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:49.317
it is a lot of weight to carry.

00:54:49.317 --> 00:54:53.145
You continue now following Vilya's lead.

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.520
You guys begin to crest up

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.090
and around the edge of the southern side of the mountain

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.570
heading towards the eastern edge of the island.

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.170
As you all are making your way around,

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:07.495
and because of the weight--
LAURA: ♪ Making our way ♪

00:55:07.495 --> 00:55:09.000
MATT: -- and the speed you're traveling-- yes?

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.090
LAURA: No, nothing.
MATT: Okay.

00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:13.510
It is a bit of a challenge to maintain height,

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.541
maintain the people you're carrying--

00:55:15.541 --> 00:55:16.680
TRAVIS: Oh shit, a challenge.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.750
MATT: I do need Caleb and Jester

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.370
and I'll have Vilya here

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:24.720
to go ahead and just roll a standard strength check

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.900
as the giant owl.

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.984
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: Which is plus one.

00:55:29.984 --> 00:55:30.967
LAURA: That's it?

00:55:30.967 --> 00:55:33.093
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the--

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:36.710
god, my god, my brain has made of Swiss cheese.
LIAM: Would you know to Bless me, though?

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:39.850
TALIESIN: I'm going to, yeah,
I'm going to give you a Guidance.

00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:40.970
ASHLEY: Guidance.

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.980
MATT: I will say Guidance does not apply to this

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.940
because it's not a very short term--

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.070
TALIESIN: Oh, fair point.
MATT: -- attempt.

00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:51.820
Yeah, this is a prolonged exertion.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.228
LIAM: Nine.

00:55:53.228 --> 00:55:54.396
MATT: All right.
SAM: Oh boy.

00:55:54.396 --> 00:55:55.930
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:56.763
LAURA: 15.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.218
MATT: Okay.

00:55:59.218 --> 00:56:00.301
LIAM: Tracks.

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:05.970
MATT: You guys, as a group, watch as Caleb begins

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:09.225
to falter a little bit with strength.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.960
But between the three of you,

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.590
you did manage to maintain composure.

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:19.440
You end up flying a little lower than you anticipated

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.240
and coast right above

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.480
where the trees and rocks on the outside of the mountain--

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.300
LAURA: I get in front of him and give him my tailwind

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.640
so it's easier for him.
MATT: Okay, okay.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.340
And with that.
LAURA: Farted on you.

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:31.173
MATT: See, there you go.

00:56:31.173 --> 00:56:32.920
And with that you find it a bit easier,

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.930
but those of you who are dangling,

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.770
yourself as well, Fjord, from beneath these birds,

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:41.620
at times you are no more than four or five feet

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.060
above the jagged pinnacle

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.650
of a broken volcanic spire,

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:48.130
or a broken tree trunk

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:49.350
that is now jagging out

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.990
in four or five different bladed tops

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:54.000
as the moonlight just barely frames it

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.160
to where you don't even notice it

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.060
until it's right beneath you

00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:59.440
and you just barely miss it off the top.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.650
SAM: Is this like a wing suit?

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:03.170
MATT: Kind of, that kind of a feel.
LIAM: Terrible, that's terrible.

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:05.533
LAURA: I picture Beau doing a kickoff on one of them.

00:57:05.533 --> 00:57:08.391
MATT: (laughs)

00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:10.230
MARISHA: Lift, lift.
TRAVIS: Smash my shin.

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:15.500
MATT: You have not quite reached your destination yet

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:18.938
when you are aware that the spell is about to fade.

00:57:18.938 --> 00:57:21.755
LIAM: (concerned hooting)

00:57:21.755 --> 00:57:23.653
LAURA: (affirmative hooting)

00:57:23.653 --> 00:57:25.048
(laughter)

00:57:25.048 --> 00:57:27.320
LIAM: Five more minutes of this, please.

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.153
MATT: Continue.

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:29.910
LAURA: I just follow his lead,

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:32.271
if he starts to land, I go down.
MATT: All right.

00:57:32.271 --> 00:57:33.900
So you guys have now made your way

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.050
mostly around the mountain,

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:36.390
and you have to stop.

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:39.430
You're on the eastern side,

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:40.720
a little bit higher up

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.610
from where the entrance to Vokodo's tunnel was

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:44.610
on the other side of the mountain.

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:46.230
You're not to the Falls yet.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:47.480
Right as the spells finish

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:51.890
and as you land it's a little rockslide-y.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:53.790
It's not the most solid terrain,

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:55.620
but you do manage to safely stop

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.540
and revert to your forms.

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.090
You guys are on this slight outcropping

00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:00.790
on the mountain, safe,

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.030
but in still near pitch darkness

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.863
beyond what little bit

00:58:03.863 --> 00:58:06.430
of Catha moonlight is catching you guys.

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:07.540
LIAM: That was a workout.

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.370
LAURA: Maybe try to stay a little
bit higher next time, Caleb.

00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:12.350
LIAM: I forgot that-- it's starting!

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:16.160
MARISHA: Why did you shapeshift into such a scrawny owl?

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:16.993
You can like--

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:19.970
It doesn't have to be like you, right?

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.552
When you shapeshift, you can beef 'em up?

00:58:21.552 --> 00:58:23.322
LIAM: Yeah, well, I'm proud of my smarts, so.

00:58:23.322 --> 00:58:24.263
MARISHA: Well.

00:58:24.263 --> 00:58:29.038
(laughter)

00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:34.250
MATT: Now, Vilya says, "Are you able to do that again?"

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:36.320
LAURA: Sure.
LIAM: Yeah, easily.

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.500
MATT: "Then let's take the rest of the journey."

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.333
SAM: Oh.

00:58:39.333 --> 00:58:44.333
MATT: And she turns right back
into her giant owl form, and--

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.713
TRAVIS: Just let me--
MATT: (whooshes)

00:58:45.713 --> 00:58:48.580
TRAVIS: (shrieks)
(laughter)

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.380
MATT: Immediately lifts off once more with Fjord.

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.082
TRAVIS: Communication!

00:58:53.082 --> 00:58:55.740
LIAM: Caleb changes and his whole head rotates

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.870
180 degrees around and looks at Veth,

00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:59.888
grabs her, grabs Caduceus. Hoo!

00:58:59.888 --> 00:59:00.956
TALIESIN: Oh boy.
(laughter)

00:59:02.431 --> 00:59:04.000
LAURA: Did one of you guys want to ride on my back,

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.250
or are you good dangling?

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:07.820
MARISHA: It's kind of fun dangling.

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.196
ASHLEY: I kind of like dangling.
MARISHA: It's kind of nice.

00:59:09.196 --> 00:59:10.420
LAURA: Tight. All right.

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.857
ASHLEY: Feels a little dangerous.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:59:11.857 --> 00:59:14.120
MATT: It's like both of you guys
in those hanging rollercoasters.

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.336
MARISHA: Yeah, totally.

00:59:15.336 --> 00:59:17.660
LAURA: Ah!

00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:19.117
MARISHA: (sneezes)
LAURA: Bless you.

00:59:19.117 --> 00:59:21.146
SAM: Gesundheit.
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:59:21.146 --> 00:59:22.660
MATT: Careful, don't pop another rib.

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:23.493
MARISHA: I know, right?

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:24.598
LAURA: Oh god.
TALIESIN: Oh man.

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:27.070
MATT: As you guys begin to make your way

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:29.110
down the side of the mountain,

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:30.360
and from this perspective, too,

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.470
the moonlight is hitting the eastern side

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:34.780
of the mountain, so you can see the shape of it

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:39.190
against the blackened silhouette of the night sky above it,

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:41.210
and you can see the plume of smoke

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.930
that is rising up and then vanishing

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:46.440
into the dark abyss of the night sky.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.480
Following Vilya further down,

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.440
eventually, you can see now there are pools of water

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.370
that are up above, gathering in small areas,

00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:57.610
recesses atop this volcanic edge

00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:59.870
where the mountain begins to level out a bit.

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:02.320
The decline is not quite as steep,

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.120
and there are small waterfalls,

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.200
and there's a gentle spray sensation that hits you,

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.148
like nearby waves are crashing.

01:00:09.148 --> 01:00:12.000
And as you follow Vilya towards the edge,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.230
you can see where the cliff ends,

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:14.260
but there is a spray,

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.790
there is a perpetual splash of water,

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:21.540
similar to a brook hitting a rough bit of rocks,

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:24.590
and the white rapids are beginning to gather,

01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:25.940
but it's at the edge of the cliff

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:27.750
and spilling into these pools

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:31.160
and creating this small series of tangled rivers

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.440
that are all gathering in this base area of the mountain.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.880
It is, in its own way, it's strange,

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.040
and you hear the sound of rushing water

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.640
getting louder and louder

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.050
until eventually you, Fjord, being the first one to see it,

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:47.140
it looks like a spraying crashing wave.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.890
Like the moment where the wave

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:50.870
is coming towards the shore and begins to crest

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:52.700
and break the shore,

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.810
but it's coming upward and splashing

01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:57.180
into the top part of this cliff.

01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.240
And it's maybe 10 feet beneath your feet.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.740
And then as you pass over that edge

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:06.176
it is a sheer drop, about 150 feet--

01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:07.280
MARISHA: Oh!

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.350
MATT: -- into a lagoon below.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:13.390
And as you glance underneath and look

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:16.360
you can see it looks like your standard waterfall.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.430
You can see the sheet of water,

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:21.780
but it is all coming upward

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.120
and then splashing and breaking upon that cliff face

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.120
where it's breaking down

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.560
into the various little pools and streams above.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.280
It is quite a surreal sight.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.504
TRAVIS: Breaks my brain a little bit.

01:01:34.504 --> 01:01:35.890
MARISHA: That is so cool.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:37.280
MATT: All of you guys follow suit,

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.800
and as you follow the lead of Vilya, eventually,

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.240
there isn't much of a beach

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.800
in this immediate lagoon vicinity.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.050
A lot of it is sheer cliff and broken rocks

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:49.120
that are piercing through the shoreline,

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.560
just barely visible through the moonlight at this point,

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.320
and there is one area on the southern end of this lagoon

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.840
where it breaks and turns into the beach

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.630
where Vilya ends up stopping and letting Fjord off.

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:04.440
It's about maybe, I'd say 200 or so feet

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.188
from where this waterfall is.

01:02:08.444 --> 01:02:11.990
And eventually after landing Vilya reverts back

01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:13.450
to her half-elven form

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.858
and all of you gather and land in the same little patch.

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:19.740
And it is maybe a five-foot patch of white beach sand

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:23.150
before it turns into the rocky shore and the inlet.

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:25.180
TRAVIS: And completely dark, yes?

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.670
MATT: There are no light sources here

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:27.920
beyond the moonlight that you have.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.538
TRAVIS: I'll summon the sword and make it glow.

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:31.483
MATT: Okay.

01:02:31.483 --> 01:02:33.563
So you guys have that bit of a beacon of glowing light.

01:02:33.563 --> 01:02:36.779
LAURA: Wait, did your sword show up?

01:02:36.779 --> 01:02:37.770
MATT: Yeah.

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:40.740
LAURA: (laughs) Tight.
(Travis snaps)

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.670
SAM: Nice.

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.062
TRAVIS: He'll be pissed.

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:45.063
MATT: So.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.150
TRAVIS: Do we see or hear anything around us?

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:53.800
Noises, movement?
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.620
TRAVIS: Oh, me?
LIAM: I'm going to do the same

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:58.110
but as an owl, I have not changed out yet.

01:02:58.110 --> 01:02:59.600
LAURA: Yeah, should we change back?

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.550
LIAM: I have not yet.

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:02.980
LAURA: I'm going to go off your example.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.790
TRAVIS: 16.
MATT: 16, okay.

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:06.110
And you're both going to check as well?

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:08.435
LIAM: Yeah, at advantage as a giant owl.

01:03:08.435 --> 01:03:09.385
MATT: Okay.

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.200
LAURA: Perception?
MATT: Yep.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.970
TALIESIN: Also, yeah.

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:14.290
MATT: You do not have darkvision, so at disadvantage.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:16.370
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't have darkvision.

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:18.010
I am going to do
Eyes of the Grave, though.

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:18.843
MATT: Okay.

01:03:18.843 --> 01:03:21.590
TALIESIN: And Detect Magic, just because why the fuck not?

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:22.672
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Good idea.

01:03:22.672 --> 01:03:24.754
MATT: What's the range on Detect Magic again? Is it 60 feet?

01:03:24.754 --> 01:03:28.040
TALIESIN: It's-- that's a good question.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.582
It's 30 feet.
MATT: 30 feet?

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.160
Neither one of those vision quests,

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.160
localized vision quests seem to present you

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.280
with anything unique or different

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.370
from the nature that surrounds you.

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:40.250
TALIESIN: Gotcha.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.260
MATT: What'd you get?
LIAM: 19.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.620
MATT: 19, cool. Jester?
LAURA: 14.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.780
MATT: 14.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.590
The three of you taking in the surroundings,

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:49.300
beyond some movement by the shoreline

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.710
and some of the nearby rocks

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:54.370
that begin the walk towards the inlet,

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:56.400
you can see crabs that are gathered

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.233
on the edges of the rock,

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:58.590
and as the waters smash over

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:01.040
some get pulled off and some crawl back on.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.240
Nothing out of the ordinary of what would be expected

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.250
in the natural habitat that you stand at

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.590
catches your attention.

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:10.127
ASHLEY: Do we feel like a--

01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:13.360
Do we still feel like we're being watched,

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.090
or does that feel a little heavier here?

01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:18.687
MATT: That feeling has not subsided.

01:04:18.687 --> 01:04:20.260
It has been present since the moment you came here

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.093
and has never left.

01:04:21.093 --> 01:04:23.080
And you'll forget about it at times,

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.360
and you'll forget that it's there,

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.540
and then the moment you're not in the middle

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.720
of a conversation, not engaged in a challenge

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.070
or a problem-solving thought,

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:32.903
the minute you have a moment

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:36.185
to pull out of the moment and think and breathe,

01:04:36.185 --> 01:04:37.393
you remember it's there,

01:04:37.393 --> 01:04:38.625
and it never left.

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:43.229
LIAM: I do the head twist around to you and then

01:04:43.229 --> 01:04:46.540
(whooshes) back into myself.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.018
TRAVIS: Is your head still backwards?

01:04:48.018 --> 01:04:49.573
(laughter)

01:04:49.573 --> 01:04:51.784
SAM: (yelling)
TRAVIS: Oh god.

01:04:51.784 --> 01:04:56.010
LAURA: How much longer do
we have until the spell breaks?

01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.160
MATT: You probably have about 30 minutes or so.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.440
TRAVIS: You going to go scout?
MATT: Little over 30 minutes.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.460
MARISHA: I'll go with you if you want to try and--

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.778
SAM: "Owl" go with you?

01:05:04.778 --> 01:05:05.986
TRAVIS: Boy. New bar.

01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:09.453
LAURA: Well, I can't-- (hooting).

01:05:09.453 --> 01:05:12.720
MARISHA: (hooting) If you still wanted to go scout.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.130
LAURA: (hooting)
MARISHA: I could, yeah.

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:18.045
LIAM: She's saying she's sleepy is what she said.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.414
MARISHA: Oh, if you're tired, yeah, we could sleep, too.

01:05:20.414 --> 01:05:21.330
LAURA: I just grab her and go.

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:24.260
MARISHA: Okay-- (yells)
(laughter)

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.170
TRAVIS: (yelling)

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:28.250
MATT: You watch as Jester-owl grasps Beau

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.640
and the two take off.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.725
Where are you guys--
MARISHA: Put on my--

01:05:31.725 --> 01:05:32.770
MATT: Night vision goggles?
MARISHA: My night vision goggles.

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:35.040
MATT: Okay, where are you guys headed?

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.430
LAURA: Away from the volcano.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:40.930
I want to get 15 minutes out as far as I can go

01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:42.430
towards the island.

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:44.050
MATT: Towards the one to the northeast?

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:44.883
LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.990
And then as far as we can go out,

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.970
I want to see if that feeling ever subsides

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:53.620
as we get more distant.
MARISHA: Totally.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.890
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Samesies.

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:56.517
MATT: 15 minutes of flying.

01:05:56.517 --> 01:05:57.787
It won't get you close to the island,

01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:00.120
you'll travel a little ways offshore,

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.280
but since you're carrying somebody

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.593
you can't move at the full speed, necessarily.

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:04.738
LAURA: Right.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.660
MATT: Make a perception check, both of you.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.311
MARISHA: Okay.

01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:13.380
All right, don't fuck this up.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:14.213
LAURA: Oh, advantage.

01:06:14.213 --> 01:06:16.290
LIAM: The owl has advantage for perception, for hearing.

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:20.730
MATT: This is less about sight, this is more about just

01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:22.440
sensing something within yourself,

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.240
so the owl sight would not--
LAURA: Internal perception.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.657
LIAM: Advantage wouldn't drop--
MATT: Yes.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.930
TRAVIS: Is it a thought or a hoot?
MARISHA: Uh-oh.

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:35.558
(laughter)

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:38.760
MARISHA: I have a 21.
LAURA: Oh, that's better.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.380
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I don't sense much.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.570
MATT: You don't.
(laughter)

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:44.400
You sense a grumbling stomach

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.050
and visions of small voles

01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:50.235
and other rats fill your head as you hunger.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.870
You sense no change.

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:54.980
MARISHA: Fuck.

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:56.400
We're about 15 minutes offshore?

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.690
MATT: Yeah.

01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:00.647
You can see the vaguest dark shape on the horizon

01:07:00.647 --> 01:07:01.970
of that additional island,

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:05.600
but in the time that you traveled,
there's been no noticeable

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.867
increase or decrease in that presence.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.310
But what you do notice with your perception

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:12.990
as you're looking back over

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:16.020
is the cap atop the volcano itself

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:17.340
is glowing a little redder

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:20.720
and the smoke is a little bit thicker than it was

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.100
when you guys first traversed it.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.158
SAM and LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:07:23.158 --> 01:07:24.820
MATT: At this point you guys can feel a slight, like,

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.390
(rumbling) just a brief burst of an angry rumble.

01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:29.580
LAURA: Uh-oh.
MARISHA: Sword.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.012
TRAVIS: I should have left the sword.

01:07:32.012 --> 01:07:33.062
LAURA: (gasps)

01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:35.163
TRAVIS: No!

01:07:35.163 --> 01:07:38.730
No, don't give me the DM's eyebrow! Come on, man.

01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:41.091
There's a bunch of treasure up there and shit!

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:42.360
LAURA: We got to go--

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.284
MARISHA: Oh shit.
LAURA: We got to go back.

01:07:44.284 --> 01:07:45.610
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:46.758
Do-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:48.229
MATT: All right, so you guys head back.

01:07:48.229 --> 01:07:49.528
TRAVIS: Oh no.

01:07:51.794 --> 01:07:53.950
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check for me.

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:55.492
LAURA: As an owl?
MATT: As an owl.

01:07:57.036 --> 01:07:57.890
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:59.540
LAURA: Jesus Christ. (mumbles)
TALIESIN: Could've waited.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.537
LAURA: -- roll well.
TRAVIS: Could've.

01:08:01.537 --> 01:08:02.970
TALIESIN: Coulda.
TALIESIN: Really coulda.

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:04.390
SAM and MATT: Five?

01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:05.940
You like mice.
MATT: So.

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:08.530
You stop at what you think is about the 15 minute mark

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:09.928
and start heading back.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:08:09.928 --> 01:08:11.430
SAM: Oh no.

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:14.055
MATT: Hard to count precise time when you're an owl.

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:16.680
MARISHA: Oh, well I wouldn't
really know, though, I guess, either.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.360
MATT: No, but what you do notice

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:21.240
is you guys can see in the distance

01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:25.800
Jester, giant owl form, clutching Beauregard from beneath,

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.350
approaching, coasting in

01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:30.558
maybe about 100 or so feet out before--

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.310
And both just going to continue to coast,

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:37.920
dropping about 150 feet up in the air

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.360
towards the water below.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.838
Both of you guys are just plummeting
towards the ocean right now.

01:08:42.838 --> 01:08:44.940
LAURA: I cast Dimension Door.
MATT: Okay.

01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:47.723
LAURA: Grab Beau and cast Dimension Door,
500 feet to the ground.

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:49.560
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.290
I'll say, since you revert, you're no longer grasping her,

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:54.830
since it's just your feet.

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:55.720
This is going to be an attempt

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.540
for you guys to grab each other before you cast it

01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.220
because you are currently now falling

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:00.757
with no anchoring on each other.

01:09:00.757 --> 01:09:02.094
LAURA: Beau Beau Beau Beau!
MARISHA: (yelling)

01:09:02.094 --> 01:09:03.700
MATT: So both of you guys go ahead

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.520
and roll a strength check for me.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.440
Or athletics, athletics.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.720
ASHLEY: Come on.
MARISHA: Athletics?

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.736
MATT: Athletics.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:09:10.736 --> 01:09:13.580
SAM: I really want this to fail.
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.160
LAURA: 22.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.190
MARISHA: 13 plus eight is totally 21 again.

01:09:18.190 --> 01:09:19.890
MATT: Yeah, you guys Beastmaster grasp

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:21.080
in the middle of the air

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.790
and just Nightcrawler bamf out of the air

01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:26.640
and both appear right in the middle of the sand.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.870
There's just enough residual momentum

01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:31.090
to impact the sand,

01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:33.260
and all of you guys watch suddenly as they both vanish

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.280
and then (whooshes) there is a splash of sand

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.430
into all of your faces,

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:39.940
gritting into your mouth and teeth for a second

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.940
as both Beauregard and Jester sit there

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:45.450
and stand up from the base of sand on the beach.

01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:48.290
LAURA: How cool did that look, everyone?

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:49.450
MARISHA: Was it awesome?

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:51.200
I've-- knocked the air out of me.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.866
LAURA: Are you okay? I'm sorry. Are you okay?

01:09:52.866 --> 01:09:54.550
TRAVIS: Looked more panicked than cool.
MARISHA: No, I'm good.

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:55.383
Huh?

01:09:55.383 --> 01:09:57.082
SAM: It was cool. It was really cool.
You guys did great.

01:09:57.082 --> 01:09:59.750
LAURA: It felt pretty cool.
TRAVIS: Your teeth are so messed up right now.

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:00.583
MARISHA: Are they--?

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.470
No, is that true?
LAURA: Oh, I think some bugs

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:04.400
might've been hitting your face.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.420
At least you had the goggles on, though.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.850
MARISHA: Yeah, I can't see through them,

01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:08.683
there's a lot of bugs.
TRAVIS: She removes the goggles

01:10:08.683 --> 01:10:10.342
and it's just like, carnage everywhere else.

01:10:10.342 --> 01:10:12.290
(laughter)

01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:13.424
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Jungle, yeah.

01:10:13.424 --> 01:10:14.630
LIAM: Gnats.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:16.180
The heavy gnat clouds that sit around

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:17.262
the edge of the shoreline

01:10:17.262 --> 01:10:18.750
with all the dead crabs that are out there, yeah.

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:20.217
TRAVIS: Ugh.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:22.630
MARISHA: Good news is...

01:10:25.284 --> 01:10:26.950
I don't know if it's good news.

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:28.350
Yeah, I can still feel the presence

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.090
about 15 or so minutes off the shore, so.

01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:32.780
TRAVIS: That's not good.
LAURA: Bad news--

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:34.650
SAM: That's good to know, though.
MARISHA: It's bad news, right.

01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:39.270
LAURA: Bad news is the volcano looks maybe--

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:40.880
MARISHA: A little madder.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.180
LAURA: Yeah, like it's red and on the top, and it's smoky.

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.810
TRAVIS: That just sounds like a volcano to me,

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.681
no cause for concern.
LAURA: Has it ever been red

01:10:48.681 --> 01:10:51.720
and smoky before like that?

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.710
MATT: "Generally only when something has angered Vokodo."

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:57.170
TRAVIS: Seems fine.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:59.910
LAURA: What would've made him angry, do you think?

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:04.320
MATT: "If a particular delivery of offerings

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.479
"was not quite up to expected--"

01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:08.725
TRAVIS: That seems awful specific.

01:11:08.725 --> 01:11:13.725
(laughter)

01:11:13.864 --> 01:11:17.410
LAURA: What does he usually do
if he gets super mad like that?

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:22.273
MATT: "I mean, it's generally an intimidation tactic."

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:24.612
LIAM: You know, it's funny, Fjord,

01:11:24.612 --> 01:11:26.680
you just threw out your sword thing,

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.330
but you also just gave that to him,

01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:32.296
so there could be some correlation.

01:11:32.296 --> 01:11:34.568
TRAVIS: There-- there-- there might be, mm-hmm.

01:11:34.568 --> 01:11:35.510
LAURA: You think he would notice

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:37.130
that something like that went missing off his back?

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:38.960
TRAVIS: I thought he had an awful lot of treasure,

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.280
that seems really--
SAM: And if he did notice--

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.260
TRAVIS: -- paying attention.
SAM: It's a power move.

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.110
I applaud it, that's a good move.

01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:46.430
TRAVIS: Thank you.
SAM: Yeah.

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:47.780
Showing him who's boss.

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:49.188
TRAVIS: Yes.
SAM: Or them?

01:11:49.188 --> 01:11:51.091
Is it a him? I'm sorry.

01:11:51.091 --> 01:11:53.880
SAM: Is Vokodo a person?

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.570
MATT: "Vokodo's presented as a male deity,

01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:00.990
"but I do not know for certain."

01:12:01.209 --> 01:12:02.609
MATT: "However," and Vilya looks back

01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:03.939
and you can see now at the top

01:12:03.939 --> 01:12:05.859
of the Rumblecusp volcano

01:12:05.859 --> 01:12:08.559
there is a definitive orange glow

01:12:08.559 --> 01:12:09.719
that is, in small ways,

01:12:09.719 --> 01:12:13.399
beginning to spider down the peak of the mountain.

01:12:13.399 --> 01:12:15.809
TRAVIS: That just seems seasonal, really.

01:12:15.809 --> 01:12:17.899
LIAM: Does it look like it could reach here?
TALIESIN: Anything heading our way, or?

01:12:17.899 --> 01:12:18.732
MATT: Nothing your way.

01:12:18.732 --> 01:12:20.209
It doesn't look like a major eruption,

01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:23.339
but there definitely is volcanic activity

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:26.149
at the tip and some element of molten rock

01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:28.989
currently making its way from the peak.

01:12:28.989 --> 01:12:30.302
LIAM: This is just Sauron going like--

01:12:30.302 --> 01:12:31.135
SAM: ♪ Making its way ♪

01:12:31.135 --> 01:12:34.819
TALIESIN: That's all I want.
MATT: (laughs)

01:12:34.819 --> 01:12:37.155
SAM: So do we sleep <i>here</i>?

01:12:38.359 --> 01:12:40.349
LIAM: Yeah, do we want to set up camp right here?

01:12:40.349 --> 01:12:42.329
SAM: I assume that you magic-y folks

01:12:42.329 --> 01:12:44.949
are nearing the end of your magics.

01:12:44.949 --> 01:12:46.479
LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:46.479 --> 01:12:49.239
TALIESIN: Got a little, but not a lot.

01:12:49.239 --> 01:12:51.539
LAURA: That last flight wiped me out.

01:12:52.439 --> 01:12:55.222
TALIESIN: Is there a place that looks safe?

01:12:55.222 --> 01:12:57.339
Could we walk a little bit to find something safe?

01:12:57.339 --> 01:12:58.789
MARISHA: I don't know if anything is safe.

01:12:58.789 --> 01:13:02.429
LAURA: Has Vokodo ever left his lair?

01:13:02.429 --> 01:13:04.029
MATT: "I've not seen him leave his lair, no."

01:13:04.029 --> 01:13:05.429
TRAVIS: 25 years.

01:13:05.429 --> 01:13:06.899
It's hard to know what safe is

01:13:06.899 --> 01:13:09.739
when waterfalls are moving up.

01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:11.649
Are there caves, recesses in the walls?

01:13:11.649 --> 01:13:13.529
Are there any--
LIAM: We should be fine

01:13:13.529 --> 01:13:14.989
with the dome.

01:13:14.989 --> 01:13:17.039
TRAVIS: Anything to just help us camouflage

01:13:17.039 --> 01:13:21.629
if he does leave and looks while we sleep.

01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:25.087
LAURA: He can see us anyway.
LIAM: He sees us everywhere we go.

01:13:26.899 --> 01:13:28.801
TRAVIS: Do we see any caves or any sort of--

01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:31.051
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:13:32.259 --> 01:13:34.126
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:37.270
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:38.569
MARISHA: Oh!

01:13:38.569 --> 01:13:39.509
MATT: With a total of--?

01:13:39.509 --> 01:13:43.419
TRAVIS: Oh, 22.
MATT: 22.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.719
From this distance,

01:13:44.719 --> 01:13:46.449
and with the faint bit of moonlight there,

01:13:46.449 --> 01:13:48.679
it's hard to see anything specific,

01:13:48.679 --> 01:13:50.569
but the edges-- I mean, the whole mountain itself

01:13:50.569 --> 01:13:52.879
being volcanic rock has a number of alcoves

01:13:52.879 --> 01:13:55.079
and natural nooks and crannies

01:13:55.079 --> 01:13:57.399
that form around the exterior.

01:13:57.399 --> 01:13:59.529
You imagine you could probably find an alcove

01:13:59.529 --> 01:14:02.691
or a cavern or a recess that could maybe fit all of you,

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:04.739
but you'd have to climb

01:14:04.739 --> 01:14:06.759
alongside the cliff face to get to it.

01:14:06.759 --> 01:14:10.199
TRAVIS: You know, with all that ooze coming out of the tip

01:14:10.199 --> 01:14:11.159
maybe not the best idea

01:14:11.159 --> 01:14:13.419
to be alongside the mountain on second thought.

01:14:13.419 --> 01:14:15.194
SAM: Smart.
ASHLEY: That's a good idea.

01:14:15.194 --> 01:14:17.739
SAM: How 'bout right here on the beach?
TRAVIS: Sounds good.

01:14:17.739 --> 01:14:18.869
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:14:18.869 --> 01:14:20.639
I still want to check this place out a bit, anyway,

01:14:20.639 --> 01:14:21.939
before I go to bed.

01:14:22.889 --> 01:14:26.069
LIAM: Okay, well I will go about creating the dome.

01:14:26.069 --> 01:14:28.144
MARISHA: You need any help or you good?

01:14:29.169 --> 01:14:32.014
LIAM: Just make sure nobody punches me
in the back of the head while I--

01:14:32.014 --> 01:14:34.119
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha, will you stay here with me

01:14:34.119 --> 01:14:36.774
and we'll guard the--
ASHLEY: Yeah, of course.

01:14:38.079 --> 01:14:40.509
TRAVIS: You going to check out the area?

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:41.739
MARISHA: Yeah, just want to--

01:14:41.739 --> 01:14:43.314
Just going to--

01:14:43.314 --> 01:14:44.980
Yeah, just figure out some shit.

01:14:46.339 --> 01:14:47.172
MATT: Okay.

01:14:48.029 --> 01:14:50.067
Who all's going to figure out some shit then?

01:14:50.067 --> 01:14:51.579
SAM: (laughs)
LAURA: I'm going to

01:14:52.439 --> 01:14:54.209
sit down a little bit away from everyone

01:14:54.209 --> 01:14:57.429
and figure out some shit.

01:14:57.429 --> 01:14:58.262
MATT: Okay.

01:14:58.262 --> 01:14:59.499
LAURA: But with my sketchbook

01:14:59.499 --> 01:15:01.299
and I'm going to try to talk to the Traveler.

01:15:01.299 --> 01:15:02.689
MATT: Okay, no worries.

01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:05.519
TALIESIN: I'm also going to
have a moment with my shit while--

01:15:05.519 --> 01:15:07.559
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Buttholes and shit.

01:15:07.559 --> 01:15:08.759
TALIESIN: Buttholes and shit.
MATT: All right.

01:15:08.759 --> 01:15:09.669
TRAVIS: Episode title.

01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:12.010
MATT: So as you're creating--

01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:16.119
(laughter)

01:15:16.119 --> 01:15:17.110
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:15:19.867 --> 01:15:21.894
MATT: It's not-- it's not going to be the episode title.

01:15:21.894 --> 01:15:25.219
(laughter)

01:15:25.219 --> 01:15:26.472
Not to say that it's not tempting.

01:15:26.472 --> 01:15:29.179
(laughter)

01:15:29.179 --> 01:15:32.212
SAM: Hey dude, what was your
favorite episode of Critical Role?

01:15:32.212 --> 01:15:33.955
TRAVIS and SAM: "Buttholes and Shit."

01:15:33.955 --> 01:15:36.349
(laughter)

01:15:36.349 --> 01:15:38.737
SAM: Always tell people to start on that one.

01:15:38.737 --> 01:15:41.879
(laughter)

01:15:41.879 --> 01:15:44.289
MATT: All right, so you're creating the dome,

01:15:44.289 --> 01:15:46.659
you're watching, Yasha you're watching as well.

01:15:46.659 --> 01:15:47.739
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:15:47.739 --> 01:15:50.739
MATT: The three of you are having your own experiences

01:15:50.739 --> 01:15:51.579
that you're looking for.

01:15:51.579 --> 01:15:53.452
Veth, are you doing anything
in particular or are you just watching?

01:15:53.452 --> 01:15:55.319
SAM: Who's going to look out at stuff? You two?

01:15:55.319 --> 01:15:56.714
MARISHA: I am.
SAM: Just you?

01:15:56.714 --> 01:15:58.263
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
SAM: No Fjord?

01:15:58.263 --> 01:16:00.171
MARISHA: Fjord is standing guard
with Caleb and Yasha.

01:16:00.171 --> 01:16:01.554
SAM: I'll come with you.
MARISHA: Okay, dope.

01:16:01.554 --> 01:16:03.721
MATT: All right, so, Jester, what are you doing?

01:16:03.721 --> 01:16:05.049
LAURA: Yes.

01:16:05.049 --> 01:16:06.540
I'm going to try to...

01:16:07.832 --> 01:16:09.569
(sighs)

01:16:09.569 --> 01:16:12.705
I'll spend 10 minutes casting Commune.

01:16:12.705 --> 01:16:14.859
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:16:14.859 --> 01:16:17.423
TRAVIS: Begrudging.
MARISHA: Most inconvenienced cleric.

01:16:17.423 --> 01:16:20.529
(laughter)
TRAVIS: "Ugh, talk to a god."

01:16:20.529 --> 01:16:24.089
LIAM: Caleb's drawing on the ground
and just watching her huff.

01:16:24.089 --> 01:16:25.442
Kick the sand.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:16:25.442 --> 01:16:26.675
MATT: (laughs)

01:16:28.536 --> 01:16:29.369
All right.

01:16:29.369 --> 01:16:31.469
So you sit with your sketchbook

01:16:31.469 --> 01:16:33.779
and you concentrate and focus,

01:16:33.779 --> 01:16:37.021
and how do you call the Traveler to you?

01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:40.669
LAURA: Come on, man, I really
need to talk to you right now.

01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:42.349
And I know that you're busy and stuff,

01:16:42.349 --> 01:16:45.942
but this is dire stuff right here, you know? Because...

01:16:47.484 --> 01:16:48.984
this could fuck up everything.

01:16:48.984 --> 01:16:51.209
MATT: There's a soft impact

01:16:51.209 --> 01:16:53.549
as you stop and hear it out in front of you,

01:16:53.549 --> 01:16:54.872
and as you look up from your sketchbook

01:16:54.872 --> 01:16:57.929
sitting in the sand maybe two feet from you

01:16:57.929 --> 01:17:01.219
is the Traveler, full cloak, hood back,

01:17:01.219 --> 01:17:02.309
and cross-legged,

01:17:02.309 --> 01:17:05.486
just sitting right in front of you eye to eye.

01:17:06.809 --> 01:17:08.949
"Hello, Jester."
LAURA: Hi.

01:17:08.949 --> 01:17:10.329
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:17:10.329 --> 01:17:11.845
MATT: "What's wrong? You look so..."

01:17:13.029 --> 01:17:14.954
LAURA: This guy here.

01:17:15.941 --> 01:17:17.066
He's a real--

01:17:17.939 --> 01:17:21.374
He's a dick, man, like not in a good way.

01:17:21.374 --> 01:17:23.349
MATT: "There's a lot of them out there, you're not wrong."

01:17:23.349 --> 01:17:26.929
LAURA: But this guy, like, this whole island is weird,

01:17:26.929 --> 01:17:29.479
it's like opening-- look at this waterfall.

01:17:29.479 --> 01:17:30.749
Have you ever seen anything like that?

01:17:30.749 --> 01:17:32.779
This doesn't count as a question.

01:17:32.779 --> 01:17:35.329
Like, come on.
(laughter)

01:17:37.044 --> 01:17:38.749
MATT: He looks back and says,

01:17:38.749 --> 01:17:39.969
"That is quite impressive,

01:17:39.969 --> 01:17:42.289
"I mean, from a mortal standpoint.

01:17:42.289 --> 01:17:43.839
"There are some places in the Fey

01:17:43.839 --> 01:17:45.697
"that are just mind-boggling."

01:17:45.697 --> 01:17:47.999
LAURA: We need to go there.
MATT: "One of these days. You are welcome to."

01:17:47.999 --> 01:17:50.609
LAURA: Can you take everyone there?
Can we sleep in the Feywild?

01:17:50.609 --> 01:17:52.639
MATT: "I would prefer not to go back,

01:17:52.639 --> 01:17:54.699
"but you're welcome to go any time you like.

01:17:54.699 --> 01:17:59.079
"I'll just keep my time here as well.

01:17:59.079 --> 01:18:02.102
"But I'm sorry, you brought me here for a purpose.

01:18:02.102 --> 01:18:04.744
"Did you have any questions?"
LAURA: People lose their memory here.

01:18:06.339 --> 01:18:07.879
They could be here for two or three days

01:18:07.879 --> 01:18:09.729
and then they get stuck here forever.

01:18:10.889 --> 01:18:12.648
Did you know that could happen?

01:18:14.399 --> 01:18:15.707
MATT: "I...

01:18:17.095 --> 01:18:19.139
"I was aware."

01:18:19.139 --> 01:18:21.869
SAM: What a dick. (laughs)

01:18:21.869 --> 01:18:24.439
LAURA: Like, I understand if you want to get rid

01:18:24.439 --> 01:18:25.891
of some of your followers,

01:18:25.891 --> 01:18:28.149
we talked about it, it's okay, you know?

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.709
A few of them could stay, but I don't want to stay.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.935
MATT: "You're not going to stay.

01:18:35.935 --> 01:18:38.069
"(sighs) Jester, Jester, Jester, Jester,"

01:18:38.069 --> 01:18:40.477
and he reaches out and takes your hands and says,

01:18:41.449 --> 01:18:43.809
"Please don't ever think I'm not looking out

01:18:43.809 --> 01:18:45.432
"for your best interest.

01:18:47.549 --> 01:18:49.319
"And I wasn't planning to leave them all here,

01:18:49.319 --> 01:18:50.869
"it was more of a backup plan

01:18:50.869 --> 01:18:54.139
"if things didn't work out well with the Traveler Con thing.

01:18:54.139 --> 01:18:57.856
"You have to have a series of layers
for something like this.

01:19:00.228 --> 01:19:01.529
"Oh, dear thing," and he reaches out

01:19:01.529 --> 01:19:04.696
and puts his thumb on the cheek and says, "I--

01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:07.034
"I don't mean to put you through this.

01:19:13.056 --> 01:19:14.339
"I was never going to abandon you

01:19:14.339 --> 01:19:16.595
"or leave you to this.

01:19:16.595 --> 01:19:18.077
"If things went sideways when we arrived

01:19:18.077 --> 01:19:20.652
"I would've just plucked you
and everyone else of import, and--"

01:19:20.652 --> 01:19:22.099
LAURA: Everyone else, too?

01:19:22.099 --> 01:19:24.009
MATT: "Everyone else of import."

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:25.009
LAURA: My friends?

01:19:25.009 --> 01:19:27.519
MATT: "Oh, your friends, yes, of course.

01:19:27.519 --> 01:19:29.689
"But let's be honest, there are a few individuals

01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:32.929
"on their way here that are a royal pain in my ass.

01:19:32.929 --> 01:19:34.569
"Let me tell you, trying to charter this many ships

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:37.256
"from the middle of the Menagerie Coast--"

01:19:37.256 --> 01:19:38.089
LAURA: It's a lot.

01:19:38.089 --> 01:19:40.689
MATT: "A lot of paperwork."
LAURA: Yeah.

01:19:40.689 --> 01:19:41.522
MATT: "I've been busy.

01:19:41.522 --> 01:19:43.219
"I hate it.

01:19:43.219 --> 01:19:44.420
"I hate all of this.

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.020
"I'm excited to be done.

01:19:47.919 --> 01:19:51.194
"But no, I wasn't going to abandon you and your friends."

01:19:54.009 --> 01:19:57.049
LAURA: So do you think we should get rid

01:19:57.049 --> 01:19:59.415
of this weird...

01:20:00.490 --> 01:20:02.831
Vo greedy guy?

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:05.759
MATT: "Perhaps.

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:07.319
"If you don't think there's much of a purpose

01:20:07.319 --> 01:20:11.919
"or a way to make him useful, then...

01:20:11.919 --> 01:20:13.709
"I mean--

01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:15.666
"what other choice is there?"

01:20:19.219 --> 01:20:20.979
LAURA: Do you want to fight him?

01:20:20.979 --> 01:20:22.609
MATT: "Me? (laughs)

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:23.996
"I don't fight.

01:20:25.509 --> 01:20:30.089
"I hedge my bets on those who fight for me."

01:20:30.089 --> 01:20:31.197
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:36.109 --> 01:20:36.942
Okay.

01:20:39.539 --> 01:20:41.299
You promise?

01:20:41.299 --> 01:20:42.432
You promise?

01:20:46.479 --> 01:20:48.787
MATT: "I am of a...

01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:50.886
"a kind

01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:57.049
"of entity that promises are binding.

01:20:58.089 --> 01:21:02.469
"Makes them dangerous, makes them easy to regret,

01:21:02.469 --> 01:21:04.010
"but binding.

01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:07.026
"And I promise."

01:21:08.399 --> 01:21:10.107
LAURA: (whispered) Okay.

01:21:11.219 --> 01:21:14.223
MATT: "And I'm sorry if you felt abandoned. I...

01:21:15.909 --> 01:21:17.669
"There's no excuse I can put,

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:18.629
"other than the fact that things

01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:22.834
"are a little crazy right now, and I--

01:21:22.834 --> 01:21:26.770
"(laughs ruefully) Oh, mortals are...

01:21:26.770 --> 01:21:28.653
"a special breed."

01:21:28.653 --> 01:21:30.179
LAURA: Hey man, maybe a dragon turtle

01:21:30.179 --> 01:21:32.689
will take out a couple of the boats on the way here.

01:21:34.469 --> 01:21:36.446
MATT: "Well, I don't want them dead necessarily."

01:21:36.446 --> 01:21:38.157
LAURA: No, I mean, that would be terrible.

01:21:38.157 --> 01:21:40.107
That'd be terrible.

01:21:40.107 --> 01:21:42.069
MATT: "The plan was if things went wrong

01:21:42.069 --> 01:21:43.546
"at the very least they'd be left here

01:21:43.546 --> 01:21:46.659
"to live a nice life in a village
with some people, you know?

01:21:46.659 --> 01:21:47.889
"They weren't going to be hurt,

01:21:47.889 --> 01:21:50.029
"they just would've forgotten some things."

01:21:50.029 --> 01:21:50.899
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.

01:21:50.899 --> 01:21:52.459
I mean, they're living a nice life

01:21:52.459 --> 01:21:55.029
and nobody seems to hate it when their memory's gone,

01:21:55.029 --> 01:21:56.499
but I don't want to do it.

01:21:56.499 --> 01:21:59.599
MATT: "And you won't be, it was never even part of this.

01:21:59.599 --> 01:22:00.599
"I should've clarified it.

01:22:00.599 --> 01:22:02.379
"And you're right, I should've been a little more forthright

01:22:02.379 --> 01:22:03.649
"with some of the information."

01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:05.926
LAURA: I'm here extra days, you know?

01:22:05.926 --> 01:22:08.955
Like extra time, that's extra risk.

01:22:08.955 --> 01:22:11.101
(sighs) I'm sorry, I don't mean to yell at you.

01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:14.168
MATT: "It's all right. I would've come back!"

01:22:17.949 --> 01:22:19.024
LAURA: Okay.

01:22:20.509 --> 01:22:21.342
MATT: "Hey.

01:22:22.499 --> 01:22:23.829
"You want to see something very pretty?"

01:22:23.829 --> 01:22:24.870
LAURA: Yeah.

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:28.409
MATT: Points up to the moon,

01:22:28.409 --> 01:22:32.629
and right there on the mostly full surface of Catha

01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:34.729
you see the shadows shift slightly

01:22:34.729 --> 01:22:37.739
and they form these two round googly eyes

01:22:37.739 --> 01:22:41.456
and a little smile, and these two little pointed teeth.

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:42.597
(laughter)

01:22:44.589 --> 01:22:46.131
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

01:22:47.034 --> 01:22:48.529
MATT: And you turn your head back and he's gone.

01:22:48.529 --> 01:22:50.795
LAURA: Oh, man.

01:22:53.103 --> 01:22:54.221
Okay.

01:22:54.221 --> 01:22:55.549
(sighs) Okay.

01:22:55.549 --> 01:22:57.974
LIAM: You okay over there?
LAURA: Yeah, I'm fine.

01:22:58.929 --> 01:23:00.544
Just-- I'm just drawing.

01:23:02.009 --> 01:23:05.299
LIAM: Maybe didn't go as well as you were hoping?

01:23:07.539 --> 01:23:09.364
LAURA: In some ways it went better.

01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:12.382
But no.

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:17.076
(sighs)

01:23:17.076 --> 01:23:18.896
LIAM: I can't speak for him,

01:23:20.139 --> 01:23:22.840
but you do have us.
LAURA: I know.

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.818
LIAM: So whatever you land on,
Jester, we'll make it happen.

01:23:27.818 --> 01:23:29.001
LIAM: So whatever you land on,
Jester, we'll make it happen.

01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:32.682
LAURA: I have to figure out what I want to land on.

01:23:36.099 --> 01:23:39.959
LIAM: That is the sticky wicket, isn't it?

01:23:39.959 --> 01:23:41.069
LAURA: Yeah.

01:23:41.069 --> 01:23:42.669
Everything's confusing.

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:50.229
LIAM: Maybe we sleep on it,

01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:52.809
it'll make more sense in the morning.

01:23:52.809 --> 01:23:53.642
LAURA: Yeah.

01:23:54.759 --> 01:23:55.592
Yeah.

01:23:56.469 --> 01:23:57.577
Thank you, Caleb.

01:23:58.546 --> 01:24:00.046
LIAM: I didn't do anything.

01:24:02.569 --> 01:24:03.744
MATT: Caduceus.

01:24:05.389 --> 01:24:06.881
TALIESIN: Going to take my minute.

01:24:08.508 --> 01:24:10.508
(sighs)

01:24:12.479 --> 01:24:15.382
Calm down, listen carefully.

01:24:16.806 --> 01:24:19.459
MATT: You can hear the sound of the waves

01:24:19.459 --> 01:24:22.579
crashing rhythmically against the shore,

01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:25.661
soft, comforting.

01:24:27.407 --> 01:24:32.397
And with each crash, the waves get fainter and fainter.

01:24:33.389 --> 01:24:35.809
The cold beach air of night

01:24:35.809 --> 01:24:37.729
getting warmer and warmer.

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:40.629
And with your eyes closed,

01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:44.792
you can feel just this warm

01:24:46.429 --> 01:24:48.459
formless embrace around you

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:52.369
as the presence, the consciousness,

01:24:52.369 --> 01:24:55.427
the will of the Wild Mother you sense surround you.

01:24:59.059 --> 01:25:00.334
TALIESIN: This...

01:25:01.359 --> 01:25:05.542
this force that is eating our memories and will,

01:25:08.339 --> 01:25:12.171
does its influence extend to the island on the horizon?

01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:16.359
MATT: You open your eyes, and before you,

01:25:17.369 --> 01:25:18.819
your vision is not where you were sitting,

01:25:18.819 --> 01:25:20.469
but you can see before you the island

01:25:20.469 --> 01:25:22.949
that is beyond the horizon,

01:25:22.949 --> 01:25:25.729
and for a moment you see the wind blow,

01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:29.579
and this strange translucent maroon coloration

01:25:29.579 --> 01:25:32.499
that encircles the island

01:25:32.499 --> 01:25:35.489
and then spreads across the rest of Rumblecusp,

01:25:35.489 --> 01:25:37.159
and you sense that the influence

01:25:37.159 --> 01:25:41.767
of whatever's affecting this region

01:25:41.767 --> 01:25:43.593
is all-encompassing.

01:25:45.524 --> 01:25:46.357
MARISHA: Okay.

01:25:47.869 --> 01:25:51.179
TALIESIN: I know that there's a way to undo the effects.

01:25:52.419 --> 01:25:54.094
Is there any way to block them

01:25:58.059 --> 01:25:59.297
that I might know?

01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:05.054
MATT: The Wild Mother's presence seems tenuous.

01:26:06.499 --> 01:26:08.979
The question seems difficult to answer.

01:26:08.979 --> 01:26:10.089
It's--

01:26:10.089 --> 01:26:13.842
TALIESIN: Is there any place of
safety on this island from it?

01:26:14.909 --> 01:26:16.639
MATT: From that you sense the air get cold,

01:26:16.639 --> 01:26:21.639
and a mournful apology comes from the sound

01:26:21.949 --> 01:26:23.169
of the wind around your ears,

01:26:23.169 --> 01:26:26.679
like a faint whisper saying, "I'm sorry," without language.

01:26:26.679 --> 01:26:28.429
And there is not.

01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:34.299
TALIESIN: Do I have one more, or was that the roll?

01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:36.519
MATT: I'll allow one more.

01:26:36.519 --> 01:26:39.519
We'll say she didn't give an answer, she just--

01:26:39.519 --> 01:26:41.049
there wasn't a way to answer it.

01:26:43.409 --> 01:26:44.959
TALIESIN: Does he know where we are?

01:26:47.789 --> 01:26:49.669
MATT: As you close your eyes once more,

01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:51.779
the sound of the wind

01:26:51.779 --> 01:26:53.349
and the waves entirely fades,

01:26:53.349 --> 01:26:57.839
and instead you can hear the burning of flame,

01:26:57.839 --> 01:27:00.649
the bubbling of heated water

01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:04.524
and a low growl, like a...

01:27:04.524 --> 01:27:07.479
churning bit of earth,

01:27:07.479 --> 01:27:11.291
and you sense that he is paying attention.

01:27:14.159 --> 01:27:14.992
TALIESIN: Darn.

01:27:16.139 --> 01:27:17.231
Darn, darn, darn.

01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:20.749
(sighs)

01:27:20.749 --> 01:27:24.119
MATT: And with that, as you exhale and sigh

01:27:24.119 --> 01:27:26.159
that warmth surrounds you once more,

01:27:26.159 --> 01:27:29.809
giving a comforting blanketing embrace

01:27:29.809 --> 01:27:32.319
before it slips back into the night air,

01:27:32.319 --> 01:27:33.439
your eyes still closed,

01:27:33.439 --> 01:27:34.549
and as you take one deep breath

01:27:34.549 --> 01:27:36.629
and open them once more, you're there back on the beach

01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:38.221
where you last were left.

01:27:40.209 --> 01:27:41.042
TALIESIN: Hmm.

01:27:42.449 --> 01:27:46.981
Well, (sighs) there's no safety anywhere.

01:27:48.892 --> 01:27:52.260
And he does know where we are.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.469
There's no hiding from this.

01:27:58.181 --> 01:27:59.014
TRAVIS: This is strange.

01:27:59.014 --> 01:28:02.589
I don't know what this area would offer us

01:28:02.589 --> 01:28:04.189
that he wouldn't want us to see.

01:28:06.939 --> 01:28:08.449
TRAVIS: I'm sure it'll be obvious in the morning,

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.549
I just don't know what it is now.

01:28:12.199 --> 01:28:14.349
ASHLEY: But what if we forget in the morning?

01:28:15.589 --> 01:28:19.699
TALIESIN: You can cast breathe water

01:28:19.699 --> 01:28:21.569
and it lasts for 24 hours?

01:28:21.569 --> 01:28:23.496
TRAVIS: Every day at 2:30, yeah.

01:28:25.469 --> 01:28:26.619
TALIESIN: Every day at 2:30?

01:28:26.619 --> 01:28:28.800
LAURA: So we still have it on right now?

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.329
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Mmm!

01:28:31.329 --> 01:28:33.329
TALIESIN: So if something happens in the night.

01:28:35.579 --> 01:28:36.720
I don't know.

01:28:38.099 --> 01:28:39.669
That's good.

01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:41.689
LAURA: Maybe the doorway to his lair

01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:43.949
is just through the waterfall, or something.

01:28:43.949 --> 01:28:46.239
TRAVIS: I wouldn't look to the water as a refuge though.

01:28:46.239 --> 01:28:48.879
Remember, he was depicted in fire

01:28:48.879 --> 01:28:51.759
and we had to be in the water where he was.

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:53.489
That doesn't seem right.

01:28:53.489 --> 01:28:56.209
TALIESIN: No, I don't think there's any refuge.

01:28:57.809 --> 01:28:59.579
LAURA: I wonder if we could draw him out.

01:28:59.579 --> 01:29:02.204
I wonder if he'd be weaker out of the water.

01:29:05.889 --> 01:29:07.419
TRAVIS: Hmm.

01:29:07.419 --> 01:29:08.927
TALIESIN: <i>If</i> we could draw him out.

01:29:11.339 --> 01:29:13.309
TRAVIS: That would make sense.

01:29:13.309 --> 01:29:17.851
Didn't Vilya say she was escaping from a water plane?

01:29:19.109 --> 01:29:20.217
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:29:22.621 --> 01:29:23.454
TRAVIS: Hmm.

01:29:25.749 --> 01:29:28.389
MATT: As Vilya was saying, there are,

01:29:28.389 --> 01:29:31.679
as she put it, shards or things on this island

01:29:31.679 --> 01:29:33.499
from different planes.

01:29:33.499 --> 01:29:37.449
There's a weird amalgamation

01:29:37.449 --> 01:29:40.799
aspect to the island that she can't really grasp.

01:29:40.799 --> 01:29:44.089
LAURA: Do you know if those shards were here before him,

01:29:44.089 --> 01:29:46.904
or if he's from another dimension?

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:50.774
Maybe he was pulled here and just decided to...

01:29:52.179 --> 01:29:53.789
you know, bank on it.

01:29:53.789 --> 01:29:56.209
MATT: Vilya goes, "That's possible.

01:29:56.209 --> 01:30:00.309
"I mean, as far as what bare bones lore has been passed

01:30:00.309 --> 01:30:03.659
"to the generations of those that live here on the island,

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:08.309
"since we've been here, he's been here,

01:30:08.309 --> 01:30:10.769
"and since he's been here, those have been here.

01:30:10.769 --> 01:30:13.199
"I don't think there's any information

01:30:13.199 --> 01:30:15.769
"about a time before."

01:30:15.769 --> 01:30:18.339
TALIESIN: How would anyone know who came first?

01:30:18.339 --> 01:30:20.314
TRAVIS: Sure.
MARISHA: They wouldn't.

01:30:22.431 --> 01:30:24.932
MATT: "That's an interesting point."
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:30:25.959 --> 01:30:26.989
TRAVIS: Should we sleep?

01:30:26.989 --> 01:30:29.849
LAURA: Maybe we could send him back to his own plane.

01:30:29.849 --> 01:30:31.182
TALIESIN: Maybe.

01:30:33.639 --> 01:30:37.169
LIAM: Do any of you have any jade?

01:30:37.169 --> 01:30:39.689
TRAVIS: Jade, like the stone?
LIAM: The stone.

01:30:39.689 --> 01:30:40.757
SAM: I do, but I'm not there.

01:30:40.757 --> 01:30:42.389
I think me and Beau are scouting.

01:30:42.389 --> 01:30:43.222
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, right.

01:30:43.222 --> 01:30:45.169
MARISHA: Yeah, (laughs) I don't know if we're there or not.

01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:46.539
MATT: So as you guys have this conversation

01:30:46.539 --> 01:30:48.649
to discuss about jade, "Who has jade?"

01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:51.539
We transition over to Veth and Beauregard.

01:30:51.539 --> 01:30:52.909
What are you guys doing?
SAM: Anyway, Beau,

01:30:52.909 --> 01:30:55.079
like I was saying, I got this jade bracelet

01:30:55.079 --> 01:30:57.049
and this jade rabbit statue.

01:30:57.049 --> 01:31:00.429
MARISHA: Yeah, well, I got this jade earring from my dad.

01:31:00.429 --> 01:31:01.759
SAM: I love it on you.
MARISHA: I kind of really like green.

01:31:01.759 --> 01:31:03.309
SAM: You look great.
MARISHA: Yeah, I really dig jade.

01:31:03.309 --> 01:31:04.879
Well, I mean, that's also why I used

01:31:04.879 --> 01:31:06.769
all of that jade--
SAM: Tons of it.

01:31:06.769 --> 01:31:07.749
We got so much of it,

01:31:07.749 --> 01:31:09.619
I might just throw some in the jungle here.

01:31:09.619 --> 01:31:11.959
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of great.

01:31:11.959 --> 01:31:12.929
SAM: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:31:12.929 --> 01:31:14.819
Anyway.
MARISHA: Anyway.

01:31:14.819 --> 01:31:18.909
All right, there's got to be something about this area

01:31:18.909 --> 01:31:21.959
that can offer us something that Vokodo wouldn't--

01:31:21.959 --> 01:31:25.409
or sorry, Guacamole wouldn't want us to know about, right?

01:31:25.409 --> 01:31:27.601
SAM: Good call, good cover.
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, yeah.

01:31:27.601 --> 01:31:30.679
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Not Voldemort.

01:31:30.679 --> 01:31:33.241
MARISHA: So here's the experiment I want to do.

01:31:34.469 --> 01:31:38.059
We know that that waterfall is going up and in,

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:39.889
and there seems to be

01:31:39.889 --> 01:31:44.889
an inward motion to this island, right?

01:31:45.319 --> 01:31:46.239
SAM: Yes.
MARISHA: Kind of?

01:31:46.239 --> 01:31:47.284
SAM: Yes?
MARISHA: So is it like--

01:31:47.284 --> 01:31:48.706
SAM: You want to throw something in?

01:31:48.706 --> 01:31:50.229
MARISHA: Well, yeah, yeah.

01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:52.299
So I'm going to walk over to the edge,

01:31:52.299 --> 01:31:56.129
the mouth of the waterfall before it goes up.

01:31:56.129 --> 01:31:59.529
MATT: Okay, it is a sheer cliff for about 60 or so feet

01:31:59.529 --> 01:32:02.649
before you get to the edge of the water itself,

01:32:02.649 --> 01:32:04.669
so you can either swim towards it in the water,

01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:06.709
or you can attempt to climb across the cliff itself.

01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:07.719
MARISHA: I don't want to go to the waterfall,

01:32:07.719 --> 01:32:10.419
I want to go to the entrance of the...

01:32:12.099 --> 01:32:16.236
Is it being fed from the ocean, this waterfall?

01:32:17.344 --> 01:32:20.179
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:32:20.179 --> 01:32:21.429
MARISHA: Okay.

01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:26.137
Natural 20.
(cheering)

01:32:26.137 --> 01:32:27.799
MATT: Which brings us to a total of?

01:32:27.799 --> 01:32:29.479
MARISHA: 14.
MATT: 14.

01:32:29.479 --> 01:32:31.804
MARISHA: (to herself) Oh, I need
to up my perception on my sheet.

01:32:31.804 --> 01:32:32.779
TRAVIS: Wait what?
MARISHA: Or sorry, sorry.

01:32:32.779 --> 01:32:33.933
MATT: I was like--
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:32:33.933 --> 01:32:35.181
MARISHA: 24.
MATT: 24.

01:32:35.181 --> 01:32:36.522
MARISHA: 24, plus four, plus four.

01:32:36.522 --> 01:32:37.969
MATT: I was like--
(laughter)

01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:39.386
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:32:39.386 --> 01:32:40.648
TRAVIS: What happened?

01:32:40.648 --> 01:32:42.107
This island's fucked you up.

01:32:42.107 --> 01:32:44.061
MATT: You get--
MARISHA: I don't remember numbers.

01:32:44.061 --> 01:32:45.969
MATT: You guys have walked close enough

01:32:45.969 --> 01:32:50.969
to where the rocky pebble edge

01:32:51.109 --> 01:32:52.649
gives way to the cliff

01:32:52.649 --> 01:32:53.949
where you can get as close as you can

01:32:53.949 --> 01:32:54.829
without actually entering the water

01:32:54.829 --> 01:32:55.662
or having to climb the cliff.

01:32:55.662 --> 01:32:56.849
And you look over.

01:32:56.849 --> 01:32:59.476
You notice, interesting point of order,

01:33:00.449 --> 01:33:04.789
the water around it is not being pulled in.

01:33:04.789 --> 01:33:08.859
There's a faint bit of the water's being disturbed,

01:33:08.859 --> 01:33:11.389
but only by a force from beneath.

01:33:11.389 --> 01:33:14.509
It is not pulling the water--

01:33:14.509 --> 01:33:16.489
SAM: There's a still body of water

01:33:16.489 --> 01:33:17.919
and then from it is shooting up--

01:33:17.919 --> 01:33:19.879
MATT: Is shooting up, and there's
a little bit of disturbance

01:33:19.879 --> 01:33:22.239
just from water breaking the surface,

01:33:22.239 --> 01:33:25.915
and there's a little bit of a slight bubbling with it,

01:33:25.915 --> 01:33:28.419
but the water itself is not pulling the water

01:33:28.419 --> 01:33:31.409
from the surrounding ocean to create this.

01:33:31.409 --> 01:33:33.679
And it's arcing upward in a steady stream

01:33:33.679 --> 01:33:35.099
and then it's just spreading a bit,

01:33:35.099 --> 01:33:37.759
and then crashing upon, at a slight angle,

01:33:37.759 --> 01:33:39.669
upon the edge of that cliff and the side of that mountain

01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:42.791
where it's creating that network of smaller waterfalls.

01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:45.496
LIAM: It's a giant bidet.
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

01:33:45.496 --> 01:33:46.979
SAM: (Grog voice) Bidet.
LIAM: Bring it back.

01:33:46.979 --> 01:33:48.559
MARISHA: Okay, is there a stick on the ground

01:33:48.559 --> 01:33:49.619
or something like that?

01:33:49.619 --> 01:33:51.569
A stick, or--
MATT: There's plenty of rocks.

01:33:51.569 --> 01:33:53.689
MARISHA: Nothing wooden?

01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:55.072
Nothing that floats?

01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:57.502
MATT: Not directly where you are,

01:33:57.502 --> 01:34:01.309
but you could find a section of driftwood

01:34:01.309 --> 01:34:02.209
within a short search,

01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:04.659
I'd say maybe about that long.

01:34:04.659 --> 01:34:08.899
MARISHA: Okay, I toss it into the pool.

01:34:08.899 --> 01:34:10.919
MATT: Okay, it floats.

01:34:10.919 --> 01:34:12.369
It's not being drawn towards the waterfall.

01:34:12.369 --> 01:34:13.799
It's just staying there.

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:16.239
MARISHA: Okay.

01:34:16.239 --> 01:34:17.609
Okay.

01:34:17.609 --> 01:34:18.639
MATT: It's moving just as

01:34:18.639 --> 01:34:21.199
the natural shifting of the waters,

01:34:21.199 --> 01:34:26.079
but there is no steady funneling of water current

01:34:26.079 --> 01:34:28.059
towards where the waterfall's emerging.

01:34:28.059 --> 01:34:29.299
MARISHA: Should I jump in?
SAM: No.

01:34:29.299 --> 01:34:30.666
LAURA: No, no, what?
SAM: Absolutely not.

01:34:30.666 --> 01:34:31.499
LAURA: Oh, sorry.

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:34.829
SAM: I mean, I'm all for doing crazy stupid shit,

01:34:34.829 --> 01:34:37.582
but from what Vilya said to us,

01:34:38.559 --> 01:34:40.559
whatever this waterfall is,

01:34:41.649 --> 01:34:45.309
she was fighting a kraken at the bottom of the ocean

01:34:45.309 --> 01:34:49.329
and then she was pulled here through a portal,

01:34:49.329 --> 01:34:51.339
probably that spout, right?
MARISHA: Yeah, probably.

01:34:51.339 --> 01:34:53.799
SAM: So if you swim through that

01:34:53.799 --> 01:34:55.849
you'll wind up where the kraken was.

01:34:55.849 --> 01:34:57.719
MARISHA: I wasn't going to swim through the thing,

01:34:57.719 --> 01:34:59.639
I just wanted to see, I just want to look.

01:34:59.639 --> 01:35:01.586
I just want to look.
SAM: Well, that's fine.

01:35:01.586 --> 01:35:04.419
MARISHA: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:35:04.419 --> 01:35:05.252
I'm going to jump in.

01:35:05.252 --> 01:35:07.306
TRAVIS: It always turns out to just be a look.

01:35:07.306 --> 01:35:09.209
MATT: So it's like, "Fine," "Fine,"

01:35:09.209 --> 01:35:10.999
and then Beauregard just dives into the water.

01:35:10.999 --> 01:35:14.459
MARISHA: Just if anything bad happens--

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:16.445
SAM: Should I come in after you or get help?

01:35:16.445 --> 01:35:17.659
MATT: She's already in the water.

01:35:17.659 --> 01:35:19.492
You can get back if you want to.

01:35:19.492 --> 01:35:20.325
TRAVIS: Don't you love the water?

01:35:20.325 --> 01:35:22.151
Get in there.

01:35:22.151 --> 01:35:25.259
SAM: (casual humming)
(laughter)

01:35:25.259 --> 01:35:26.809
MATT: All right, so you're now within

01:35:26.809 --> 01:35:28.829
this little lagoon inlet there,

01:35:28.829 --> 01:35:31.089
and you start swimming in the direction of the waterfall,

01:35:31.089 --> 01:35:33.809
and you can hear the sound of it breaking the surface

01:35:33.809 --> 01:35:35.049
and the spray of it up above,

01:35:35.049 --> 01:35:37.369
and the mist is hitting your face.

01:35:37.369 --> 01:35:40.429
MARISHA: Okay, I let out some air and start to sink.

01:35:40.429 --> 01:35:41.589
MATT: You can breathe underwater, so you're fine.

01:35:41.589 --> 01:35:43.839
MARISHA: Oh, right.
(laughter)

01:35:43.839 --> 01:35:44.909
I sink.

01:35:44.909 --> 01:35:46.829
MATT: You instinctually let out air,

01:35:46.829 --> 01:35:49.189
though you don't necessarily need to.

01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:50.022
Okay.

01:35:50.022 --> 01:35:51.949
You dive beneath.

01:35:51.949 --> 01:35:53.179
And I mean, it's hard to see.

01:35:53.179 --> 01:35:54.019
There's very little light down here,

01:35:54.019 --> 01:35:55.719
even though you have night vision.

01:35:56.929 --> 01:35:59.754
You can see what looks like

01:35:59.754 --> 01:36:04.069
some rippling of visuals to--

01:36:04.069 --> 01:36:04.902
at least what you can expect

01:36:04.902 --> 01:36:07.289
to be a very, very heavy stream,

01:36:07.289 --> 01:36:10.422
or jet of water, that is emerging upward

01:36:10.422 --> 01:36:12.669
to create it.
MARISHA: How deep is it?

01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:15.269
MATT: You can swim deeper, if you want.

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:16.859
MARISHA: Just a little.
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:36:16.859 --> 01:36:18.479
MARISHA: Just a little.
MATT: Okay.

01:36:18.479 --> 01:36:19.809
TRAVIS: This is how it happens.
MATT: Okay.

01:36:19.809 --> 01:36:21.099
MARISHA: Every time.

01:36:21.099 --> 01:36:23.499
MATT: 20 feet.
MARISHA: I push the red button.

01:36:23.499 --> 01:36:25.589
MATT: 30 feet.
TRAVIS: Somebody has to.

01:36:25.589 --> 01:36:28.714
LIAM: Go kill that green dragon.
MATT: 40 feet.

01:36:28.714 --> 01:36:31.229
SAM: Oh, "How's it going down there?"

01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:33.109
I'm going to say with my Message spell

01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:34.951
that can go 120 feet.

01:36:36.228 --> 01:36:37.359
MARISHA: (bubbling) It's pretty good.

01:36:37.359 --> 01:36:39.279
SAM: You can reply to this message.

01:36:39.279 --> 01:36:42.257
MARISHA: Sorry, I cut off your last message.

01:36:44.039 --> 01:36:45.579
SAM: Okay.

01:36:45.579 --> 01:36:47.002
I'll call you again in 30 seconds.

01:36:47.002 --> 01:36:49.359
MARISHA: No, yeah, yeah, hold on.

01:36:49.359 --> 01:36:51.319
MATT: Oh god, we've turned Message into Zoom.

01:36:51.319 --> 01:36:54.522
Oh no.
(laughter)

01:36:55.449 --> 01:36:56.969
LIAM: Perfect.
SAM: You're glitching.

01:36:58.209 --> 01:37:00.959
MATT: About 50 feet down you begin to be able to see a shape

01:37:00.959 --> 01:37:05.099
that would be the bottom of where the island rock

01:37:05.099 --> 01:37:07.481
begins to hit a floor.

01:37:10.341 --> 01:37:11.799
You don't see any light or anything,

01:37:11.799 --> 01:37:14.219
but you see there is a crack

01:37:14.219 --> 01:37:16.629
or some sort of an opening in the rock

01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:18.669
where the water jet is streaming out

01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:19.829
at a very intense pressure.

01:37:19.829 --> 01:37:23.329
You can feel the pressure from 20 feet away from it.

01:37:23.329 --> 01:37:28.312
The water is giving a slight bit of pushback against you.

01:37:29.179 --> 01:37:30.399
MARISHA: Okay.

01:37:30.399 --> 01:37:32.559
Do I see anything else that looks interesting

01:37:32.559 --> 01:37:34.949
at the bottom of the pool?

01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:37.782
Anything of interest at all?

01:37:37.782 --> 01:37:40.090
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:37:40.090 --> 01:37:42.249
SAM: Kraken tentacles, an extra leg.

01:37:42.249 --> 01:37:43.565
MARISHA: Not that great. 12.

01:37:43.565 --> 01:37:47.114
TRAVIS: (laughing) An extra leg.
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of, yeah.

01:37:47.114 --> 01:37:48.916
Not great.

01:37:48.916 --> 01:37:50.759
MATT: Not in particular, unfortunately, no.

01:37:50.759 --> 01:37:51.889
There's so little light,

01:37:51.889 --> 01:37:54.555
and there's quite a lot of

01:37:54.555 --> 01:37:57.121
underwater ground to check here,

01:37:57.121 --> 01:38:00.489
but nothing catches your eye in this particular place.

01:38:00.489 --> 01:38:01.939
ASHLEY: Dammit.

01:38:01.939 --> 01:38:04.669
MARISHA: Okay, I go back up.
MATT: Okay.

01:38:05.619 --> 01:38:06.784
MARISHA: It's deep.
SAM: You made it!

01:38:06.784 --> 01:38:07.969
MARISHA: Yeah, it's really--
SAM: Was it glowing?

01:38:07.969 --> 01:38:09.349
Did it try to pull you in?

01:38:09.349 --> 01:38:14.109
MARISHA: No, it's just a big fissure
in the bottom of the pool,

01:38:14.109 --> 01:38:15.679
it's just a jet stream, just--

01:38:15.679 --> 01:38:19.129
SAM: Perfectly circular, like it was designed by a god?

01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:22.629
Or like a crack?
MARISHA: (unsure) Like a crack?

01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:24.519
Like a crack?
MATT: Kind of.

01:38:24.519 --> 01:38:27.599
MARISHA: Yeah, like a crack.
MATT: About 20 feet across.

01:38:27.599 --> 01:38:30.549
15, 20 feet from--
MARISHA: Pretty big crack.

01:38:30.549 --> 01:38:32.739
20 feet, 20-foot crack.
SAM: Okay.

01:38:32.739 --> 01:38:36.279
Okay, that's good intel.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:38:36.279 --> 01:38:37.889
Okay, so, if Vilya came up,

01:38:37.889 --> 01:38:41.049
if she got spat out of this thing,

01:38:41.049 --> 01:38:42.696
where did she land?

01:38:44.819 --> 01:38:45.652
We should ask.

01:38:45.652 --> 01:38:47.876
Did she just plop on one of these rocks?

01:38:49.379 --> 01:38:50.699
SAM: I mean, it could be

01:38:50.699 --> 01:38:53.349
that more than just Vilya came through this.

01:38:53.349 --> 01:38:54.182
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:38:54.182 --> 01:38:56.679
SAM: Those serpent creatures could've come through.

01:38:57.669 --> 01:39:00.009
Or other things, other kinds of monsters.

01:39:00.009 --> 01:39:02.449
We've seen all kinds of crazy monsters on this island

01:39:02.449 --> 01:39:04.749
that aren't native, I can imagine.

01:39:05.879 --> 01:39:08.609
MARISHA: So the big question is,

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:11.209
did Vokodo cause all of these cracks

01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:12.939
in all of these different dimensions,

01:39:12.939 --> 01:39:16.984
or was that the island and he's just feeding off of it?

01:39:19.047 --> 01:39:20.869
It kind of feels like the mystery.

01:39:20.869 --> 01:39:22.579
SAM: It's cool.

01:39:22.579 --> 01:39:23.879
We'll have to ask him that,

01:39:23.879 --> 01:39:28.364
right before we kill him.
(laughter)

01:39:29.249 --> 01:39:30.407
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know if there's--

01:39:30.407 --> 01:39:31.814
I don't know, is there anything else we should look at?

01:39:31.814 --> 01:39:33.339
SAM: No, this is good, this is good.

01:39:33.339 --> 01:39:35.586
MARISHA: Okay, let's go back.
SAM: Yeah.

01:39:35.586 --> 01:39:36.419
MATT: All right.

01:39:36.419 --> 01:39:39.199
You guys return and join the rest of the group.

01:39:39.199 --> 01:39:41.599
Is there anyone else who wish to do anything

01:39:41.599 --> 01:39:43.059
before the night comes to a close?

01:39:43.059 --> 01:39:45.588
TRAVIS: Yasha and I are just sparring swords.

01:39:45.588 --> 01:39:47.639
(groaning)
(slashing)

01:39:47.639 --> 01:39:48.708
Jesus, this thing's huge.

01:39:48.708 --> 01:39:50.199
(laughter)

01:39:50.199 --> 01:39:51.969
TALIESIN: I feel like she looks bored, I don't know.

01:39:51.969 --> 01:39:53.279
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm just one-handing.

01:39:53.279 --> 01:39:56.617
(laughter)
(groaning)

01:39:56.617 --> 01:39:59.497
TRAVIS: (breathing heavily)

01:39:59.497 --> 01:40:01.629
ASHLEY: You're getting better, it's good.
TRAVIS: (out of breath) Thank you.

01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:03.309
ASHLEY: (deadpan) Oh, very strong, very scary.

01:40:03.309 --> 01:40:04.859
TRAVIS: I'm going to vomit.
(laughter)

01:40:04.859 --> 01:40:06.009
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:40:07.039 --> 01:40:08.909
LIAM: When they get back:

01:40:08.909 --> 01:40:10.559
Do either of you two have any jade?

01:40:10.559 --> 01:40:11.989
SAM: So much.

01:40:11.989 --> 01:40:13.742
So much jade.
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

01:40:13.742 --> 01:40:15.069
What do you need 'em for?

01:40:15.069 --> 01:40:17.867
LIAM: I want to do something for us this evening.

01:40:18.749 --> 01:40:20.609
May I trouble you?
SAM: Sure, sure.

01:40:20.609 --> 01:40:24.089
Would you like a jade rabbit statue

01:40:24.089 --> 01:40:27.689
or a jade bracelet, or--
LIAM: The statue would be good.

01:40:27.689 --> 01:40:28.899
SAM: The statue?

01:40:28.899 --> 01:40:30.364
Hop hop hop. (pops)

01:40:30.364 --> 01:40:32.419
LIAM: Here, come with me.
SAM: Oh, sure.

01:40:32.419 --> 01:40:34.299
LIAM: And I will lead Veth into the dome.

01:40:34.299 --> 01:40:35.299
MATT: Okay.

01:40:35.299 --> 01:40:38.286
LIAM: I've been working on a few different things.

01:40:39.386 --> 01:40:42.292
And I lay out a cloth on the floor between us.

01:40:43.549 --> 01:40:44.889
This is not going to last.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:40:44.889 --> 01:40:47.864
LIAM: And I put the statue down on the ground.

01:40:48.699 --> 01:40:50.239
I don't know what was the innuendo

01:40:50.239 --> 01:40:51.521
in any of those sentences.
MATT: I don't either.

01:40:51.521 --> 01:40:53.149
LAURA: No, it wasn't, I just look at Sam. (laughs)

01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:57.329
LIAM: Oh, okay.
(laughter)

01:40:57.329 --> 01:41:00.009
SAM: Yeah, for a second I was trying to think, "Cloth.

01:41:00.009 --> 01:41:02.367
"How in Laura's mind could that be dirty?"

01:41:02.367 --> 01:41:04.999
LAURA: I was just, like, focused and then I looked up.
LIAM: If I hear you snort I just assume

01:41:04.999 --> 01:41:07.190
I said something that reminded you of vag.

01:41:07.190 --> 01:41:08.539
MATT: We all do.
LAURA: I'm sorry, guys.

01:41:08.539 --> 01:41:10.106
ASHLEY: I deserve this this week.

01:41:11.059 --> 01:41:11.975
MATT: So continue.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:41:11.975 --> 01:41:13.383
So a cloth out on the ground

01:41:13.383 --> 01:41:15.039
and I take the jade statue

01:41:15.039 --> 01:41:17.229
and I place it onto that,

01:41:17.229 --> 01:41:20.129
and move my hand a bit through the air

01:41:20.129 --> 01:41:23.339
and then drive my palm across the statue,

01:41:23.339 --> 01:41:27.529
and the statue just sort of crumbles into a fine powder

01:41:27.529 --> 01:41:29.874
as I cast Fabricate

01:41:29.874 --> 01:41:33.299
and change it from a jade statue to jade powder.

01:41:33.299 --> 01:41:36.019
And then I scoop a little bit of that out

01:41:36.019 --> 01:41:37.979
and set it on a different cloth,

01:41:37.979 --> 01:41:40.107
and then I tie that up.

01:41:40.107 --> 01:41:41.931
I will be borrowing this.
SAM: Sure.

01:41:41.931 --> 01:41:44.079
LIAM: Put that in my satchel.
MATT: All righty.

01:41:44.079 --> 01:41:46.039
LIAM: And then I pull out a piece of fleece,

01:41:46.039 --> 01:41:48.359
and I wrap that around my hand,

01:41:48.359 --> 01:41:49.879
and start casting with that.

01:41:49.879 --> 01:41:52.529
And I throw the jade into an arc

01:41:52.529 --> 01:41:55.369
and start weaving my hand through the green that floats up,

01:41:55.369 --> 01:41:57.809
and I start to create as I cast

01:42:01.339 --> 01:42:04.349
Programmed Image.
SAM: Hmm.

01:42:04.349 --> 01:42:08.824
LIAM: And the entire dome becomes filled with

01:42:08.824 --> 01:42:12.032
pale, mostly translucent,

01:42:12.032 --> 01:42:16.839
pale, amber-colored scenes

01:42:16.839 --> 01:42:20.289
of The Mighty Nein in all of their time together,

01:42:20.289 --> 01:42:23.209
just floating like little specters through the dome.

01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:26.917
And as Veth and I watch, we see

01:42:26.917 --> 01:42:31.475
the Nein approaching Caduceus' family home

01:42:31.475 --> 01:42:33.849
in the yard,

01:42:33.849 --> 01:42:36.189
and we see all of them gathered

01:42:36.189 --> 01:42:39.239
in the hot tub together in the Xhorhaus,

01:42:39.239 --> 01:42:42.169
and we see them meeting for the first time,

01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:44.610
and Jester pointing at stinky Caleb on day one,

01:42:44.610 --> 01:42:48.018
and Jester pointing at stinky Caleb on day one,

01:42:48.018 --> 01:42:50.669
and just moments, all of them.

01:42:50.669 --> 01:42:53.539
And then sprinkled amongst that is also

01:42:53.539 --> 01:42:54.919
Caleb's approximation of things

01:42:54.919 --> 01:42:56.319
that he doesn't know about.

01:42:56.319 --> 01:42:59.339
So there is a vaguer image of Yasha

01:42:59.339 --> 01:43:01.902
with the silhouette of a woman

01:43:01.902 --> 01:43:06.509
in an open field, and Fjord with a crew of people,

01:43:06.509 --> 01:43:09.619
not a captain, but amongst a crew at sea,

01:43:09.619 --> 01:43:11.419
and a little blue girl with horns

01:43:11.419 --> 01:43:13.179
dancing around a bedroom,

01:43:13.179 --> 01:43:18.079
and a younger Beauregard training

01:43:18.079 --> 01:43:19.689
and getting her ass whooped

01:43:19.689 --> 01:43:22.759
by people that are vague and you can't make them out,

01:43:22.759 --> 01:43:26.369
and Veth with her child,

01:43:29.054 --> 01:43:30.895
and Caleb's schoolmates,

01:43:30.895 --> 01:43:34.704
and Caleb's schoolmates,

01:43:34.704 --> 01:43:38.080
and his parents,

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:43.080
and a real cat, who's not made of fairy stuff.

01:43:43.139 --> 01:43:44.909
And that is just going to last,

01:43:44.909 --> 01:43:47.839
and while everyone is in here

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:50.389
maybe it will remind us.

01:43:51.289 --> 01:43:53.036
SAM: This is amazing.

01:43:54.026 --> 01:43:55.359
Wow.

01:43:55.359 --> 01:43:57.521
With just a little bit of jade.

01:43:59.749 --> 01:44:00.709
LIAM: We have learned a lot.

01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:01.859
<i>You</i> have learned a lot.

01:44:03.529 --> 01:44:04.989
SAM: Yeah.

01:44:04.989 --> 01:44:08.339
LIAM: I noticed what you did with those bolts the other day.

01:44:08.339 --> 01:44:10.609
That was impressive. You had no help from me on that.

01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:14.659
SAM: Well, I wanted to show you
that I could make a spell, too.

01:44:14.659 --> 01:44:17.499
LIAM: You barely need me at all.

01:44:17.499 --> 01:44:20.582
SAM: Well, I mean, it was just a simple, you know?

01:44:21.429 --> 01:44:25.049
Not like this. This is amazing.

01:44:25.049 --> 01:44:27.499
LIAM: A little illusion of a goblin

01:44:27.499 --> 01:44:31.849
and a dirty beggar in a jail cell floats by.

01:44:32.789 --> 01:44:34.159
SAM: Yeah.

01:44:34.159 --> 01:44:35.789
LIAM: Long time ago, it feels like.

01:44:35.789 --> 01:44:37.889
SAM: It feels like it, yeah.

01:44:37.889 --> 01:44:40.516
And you've got Mollymauk in there.

01:44:41.429 --> 01:44:43.549
We've seen and done so much,

01:44:43.549 --> 01:44:46.736
and it hardly seems real.

01:44:51.649 --> 01:44:54.189
I hope it was--

01:44:54.189 --> 01:44:56.439
You know, of course it was, it was all worth it,

01:44:56.439 --> 01:45:00.434
everything that we've done, all the risks we've taken

01:45:00.434 --> 01:45:03.279
has been worth it so far, even if we--

01:45:04.742 --> 01:45:05.809
even if this is the end,

01:45:05.809 --> 01:45:10.379
or we forget who we are or something, it's been worth it.

01:45:10.379 --> 01:45:12.189
LIAM: Look at what two small town kids

01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:15.906
have accomplished, to date.

01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:19.199
Much more to do.

01:45:20.119 --> 01:45:21.719
SAM: Sure,

01:45:21.719 --> 01:45:24.836
but it's nice to look back every once in a while.

01:45:26.079 --> 01:45:27.487
LIAM: Impossible not to.

01:45:28.929 --> 01:45:32.039
SAM: No, it's good, it's good to look back,

01:45:32.039 --> 01:45:35.159
even back on the painful stuff.

01:45:35.159 --> 01:45:37.609
That's how you know that you've moved forward,

01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:39.759
and you're different and better.

01:45:40.779 --> 01:45:42.412
It's good to look back.

01:45:45.459 --> 01:45:47.749
This is wonderful, we should show the others.

01:45:47.749 --> 01:45:49.129
LIAM: Yeah.

01:45:49.129 --> 01:45:51.369
And I just stand up and the head pops out.

01:45:51.369 --> 01:45:53.782
Oh, come, we made something for you.

01:45:53.782 --> 01:45:54.789
Come in.

01:45:54.789 --> 01:45:55.709
TALIESIN: All right.

01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:57.139
MATT: As you all step in one by one

01:45:57.139 --> 01:46:01.779
you are greeted by this incredible amber

01:46:01.779 --> 01:46:03.429
animated menagerie of memories

01:46:03.429 --> 01:46:04.739
swirling between each other

01:46:04.739 --> 01:46:07.144
from every stage of your adventures

01:46:07.144 --> 01:46:08.799
and those individually before,

01:46:08.799 --> 01:46:13.582
and it's beautiful.

01:46:14.627 --> 01:46:16.049
LAURA: (laughs)

01:46:16.049 --> 01:46:20.269
LIAM: So if we keep watch, we don't have to ordinarily,

01:46:20.269 --> 01:46:22.169
but if two of us up at a time

01:46:22.169 --> 01:46:25.507
we're always being reminded of where we came from.

01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:27.559
LAURA: Wow.

01:46:27.559 --> 01:46:29.299
LIAM: Hopefully that's enough.

01:46:29.299 --> 01:46:31.939
TRAVIS: It's pretty crazy seeing it all played out

01:46:31.939 --> 01:46:34.609
in front of you all over again.

01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:35.629
MARISHA: It's weird that it can all fit

01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:39.611
on the inside of this dome, in a way.

01:46:41.179 --> 01:46:43.747
ASHLEY: This is beautiful.

01:46:43.747 --> 01:46:46.052
MARISHA: (laughs) Look at Fjord getting attacked by turtles.

01:46:46.052 --> 01:46:48.329
That was good.
(laughter)

01:46:48.329 --> 01:46:49.961
TRAVIS: Can we modify some of these?

01:46:49.961 --> 01:46:52.269
MARISHA: No, you got to leave it.

01:46:52.269 --> 01:46:53.953
SAM: He's got that in three places, actually.

01:46:53.953 --> 01:46:54.799
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:46:54.799 --> 01:46:58.069
Oh, tile view, whoa!

01:46:58.069 --> 01:47:01.273
LIAM: Those specific illusions
double in size just for a moment

01:47:01.273 --> 01:47:03.745
and then (whooshes).

01:47:03.745 --> 01:47:05.661
TRAVIS: Om ma ma ma.

01:47:05.661 --> 01:47:08.877
LAURA: Wow, this is amazing, Caleb.

01:47:10.059 --> 01:47:11.269
LIAM: Yeah.

01:47:11.269 --> 01:47:15.374
MATT: Vilya now steps in and looks, and,

01:47:18.259 --> 01:47:21.619
"I can't say I recognize any of this,

01:47:21.619 --> 01:47:25.939
"but there is a strong sense

01:47:27.927 --> 01:47:30.209
"of companionship here.

01:47:30.209 --> 01:47:32.529
"I take it you've been traveling quite some time."

01:47:35.263 --> 01:47:39.379
MARISHA: Are you able to hear one of her stories,

01:47:39.379 --> 01:47:44.184
and see if you can get a memory for her?

01:47:44.184 --> 01:47:47.149
LIAM: I give my best approximation

01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:49.239
of a younger version of Vilya

01:47:49.239 --> 01:47:52.989
with two legs just walking out

01:47:52.989 --> 01:47:54.179
and hovering in front of her

01:47:54.179 --> 01:47:56.869
for a moment before (whooshes).

01:47:56.869 --> 01:48:00.239
MATT: She watches it for a second and goes,

01:48:00.239 --> 01:48:02.999
"Could you do me a favor?"
LIAM: Yeah.

01:48:02.999 --> 01:48:05.149
MATT: "Could you add a man standing next to her,

01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:06.916
"walking next to her?

01:48:07.829 --> 01:48:09.822
"Light hair, half-elf.

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:16.649
"And a little girl, about 14.

01:48:16.649 --> 01:48:18.107
"Red hair."

01:48:19.269 --> 01:48:23.219
LIAM: I can do that.
MATT: "Thank you."

01:48:25.009 --> 01:48:26.689
LIAM: They're a little bit silhouetted

01:48:26.689 --> 01:48:29.157
compared to most things in the dome.

01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:32.103
MATT: "Well.

01:48:33.856 --> 01:48:35.319
"Rest well.

01:48:35.319 --> 01:48:37.444
"We've angered a fire god,"

01:48:38.399 --> 01:48:41.839
and she steps out of the dome.

01:48:41.839 --> 01:48:43.512
TRAVIS: That's really negative of her.

01:48:43.512 --> 01:48:46.799
We <i>might</i> have angered a fire god, no way to know.

01:48:46.799 --> 01:48:48.259
LAURA: I poke my head back out of it.

01:48:48.259 --> 01:48:49.999
Are you not going to sleep in the dome?

01:48:49.999 --> 01:48:52.545
MATT: "I will, I'm just taking a moment to myself."

01:48:52.545 --> 01:48:55.204
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:48:56.554 --> 01:48:58.036
LIAM: Would you like me to seal her out?

01:48:58.036 --> 01:49:00.497
(laughter)

01:49:00.497 --> 01:49:03.479
MATT: (slamming)
LIAM: (knocking)

01:49:03.479 --> 01:49:06.199
TRAVIS: I will actually wait
to make sure that she comes back in

01:49:06.199 --> 01:49:07.289
before falling asleep,

01:49:07.289 --> 01:49:08.729
so she doesn't just stay up.

01:49:08.729 --> 01:49:09.759
MATT: All right.

01:49:09.759 --> 01:49:11.200
ASHLEY: Caleb.

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:15.069
I'm going to go a little bit to the side.

01:49:15.069 --> 01:49:17.279
Could you put that one memory sort of over here

01:49:17.279 --> 01:49:19.449
so I can fall asleep to it?

01:49:19.449 --> 01:49:22.799
The one of me and Zuala.

01:49:22.799 --> 01:49:25.024
LIAM: I would be happy to.

01:49:25.024 --> 01:49:26.765
ASHLEY: Thank you.

01:49:28.289 --> 01:49:29.379
I just turn to the side

01:49:29.379 --> 01:49:32.039
and then just look at it, fall asleep.

01:49:33.579 --> 01:49:34.645
MATT: Okay.

01:49:36.619 --> 01:49:41.261
One by one you all find a night of restful and safe sleep

01:49:42.394 --> 01:49:44.759
to the best of your approximation,

01:49:44.759 --> 01:49:47.489
taking watches as you do,

01:49:47.489 --> 01:49:51.809
until eventually the bright oranges

01:49:51.809 --> 01:49:55.229
and reds and golds of dawn

01:49:55.229 --> 01:50:00.229
break across the ocean horizon, bringing with it a new day.

01:50:00.639 --> 01:50:02.139
And that's where we're going to take a break.

01:50:02.139 --> 01:50:05.169
SAM: I need to know if we're--
TRAVIS: So beautiful.

01:50:05.169 --> 01:50:07.019
MATT: When we come back.
LAURA: That's gorgeous.

01:50:07.019 --> 01:50:07.919
MATT: That was awesome.

01:50:07.919 --> 01:50:09.699
TRAVIS: You 50 First Dated us.
MARISHA: I know.

01:50:09.699 --> 01:50:13.542
Oh my god, you totally 50 First Dated us.

01:50:13.542 --> 01:50:15.831
ASHLEY: Wow.

01:50:15.831 --> 01:50:17.397
TRAVIS: Smart. Super smart.
MARISHA: That was emotional.

01:50:17.397 --> 01:50:19.039
MATT: That was awesome.

01:50:19.039 --> 01:50:20.939
All right, we will take a break here.

01:50:20.939 --> 01:50:23.329
We'll be back in a few minutes.

01:50:23.329 --> 01:50:25.994
Stick around, and we'll see what lies for us

01:50:25.994 --> 01:50:29.599
on the next half of our adventure tonight.

01:50:29.599 --> 01:50:31.449

Hey critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:51:23.422 --> 01:51:25.835
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role's shop.

01:51:27.972 --> 01:51:29.552
Ooh, look at this!

01:51:29.552 --> 01:51:30.802
Look at the details.

01:51:30.802 --> 01:51:31.875
Ooh!

01:51:33.572 --> 01:51:35.792
Darling, I recommend buying two,

01:51:35.792 --> 01:51:39.072
one for you and another for you.

01:51:39.072 --> 01:51:40.185
Let's be honest.

01:51:42.546 --> 01:51:45.296
(thunder cracks)

01:51:46.142 --> 01:51:47.072
It's so cute.

01:51:47.072 --> 01:51:48.215
I can't handle it.

01:51:51.062 --> 01:51:52.552
This is a lot of stuff, you guys,

01:51:52.552 --> 01:51:55.165
we have like so many cool things right now.

01:51:56.682 --> 01:51:57.802
All this and more!

01:51:57.802 --> 01:52:00.400
Now available in the Critical Role shop.

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.900
(jazzy music)

01:52:09.032 --> 01:52:11.232
Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

01:52:11.232 --> 01:52:14.652
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

01:52:14.652 --> 01:52:15.872
Yes.

01:52:15.872 --> 01:52:18.922
That validating and most enthusiastic congregation

01:52:18.922 --> 01:52:22.452
on the other side of the fourth wall.

01:52:22.452 --> 01:52:24.872
And what is this fourth wall

01:52:24.872 --> 01:52:27.482
separating the viewer from the creator,

01:52:27.482 --> 01:52:29.600
a portal to an often sought point of connection

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:33.585
or the Twitch subscriptions zone.

01:52:34.632 --> 01:52:37.282
On the rare occasion that you miss the live bacchanal

01:52:37.282 --> 01:52:40.667
boasted by the ragtag group of thespians on Thursday night,

01:52:40.667 --> 01:52:44.182
you may always view the show on demand in the shadowland

01:52:44.182 --> 01:52:48.122 line:20%
known as the Twitch subscription zone.

01:52:48.122 --> 01:52:50.472
Picture if you will, the necessary pieces

01:52:50.472 --> 01:52:52.542
to complete a jigsaw puzzle,

01:52:52.542 --> 01:52:55.982
but it's up to you to choose how it will be solved.

01:52:55.982 --> 01:52:59.452 line:20%
You could of course subscribe with your debt rectangle,

01:52:59.452 --> 01:53:02.592
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

01:53:02.592 --> 01:53:04.052
Perhaps you found yourself in possession

01:53:04.052 --> 01:53:06.995 line:20%
of an Amazon Prime account,

01:53:08.052 --> 01:53:09.672
you would then wake up to discover

01:53:09.672 --> 01:53:11.852
a free Twitch subscription each month

01:53:11.852 --> 01:53:14.062
for a channel of your choosing.

01:53:14.062 --> 01:53:16.192
But this artifact demands renewal,

01:53:16.192 --> 01:53:18.302 line:20%
for you must resubscribe each month

01:53:18.302 --> 01:53:20.365 line:20%
to quench it's unyielding thirst.

01:53:21.322 --> 01:53:23.312
One need not walk alone.

01:53:23.312 --> 01:53:25.122
Those who have already found their way

01:53:25.122 --> 01:53:27.412
can illuminate the path for others

01:53:27.412 --> 01:53:30.195 line:20%
via the gift of sub button on Twitch.

01:53:31.572 --> 01:53:34.332
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription

01:53:34.332 --> 01:53:36.582
and wishes to thank you from behind the thin veil

01:53:36.582 --> 01:53:39.312
of this fourth wall.

01:53:39.312 --> 01:53:42.942
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

01:53:42.942 --> 01:53:45.802
And so ends another meandering digression,

01:53:45.802 --> 01:53:49.472
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

01:53:49.472 --> 01:53:53.385
to the region we call the Twitch subscriptions zone.

01:53:54.729 --> 01:53:57.479
(dramatic music)

01:54:02.142 --> 01:54:03.485
You will subscribe.

01:54:05.212 --> 01:54:08.032
Twitch Prime subscribe.

01:54:08.032 --> 01:54:09.835
Gift subscribe.

01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:13.595
Subscribe.

01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:19.330
(dramatic music)

02:07:00.754 --> 02:07:02.114
MATT: And welcome back.

02:07:02.114 --> 02:07:07.114
So as everyone comes to in the morning--

02:07:07.384 --> 02:07:08.217
LAURA: Oh no.

02:07:08.217 --> 02:07:09.658
MATT: -- first I need you all to make a wisdom saving throw.

02:07:09.658 --> 02:07:11.261
ALL: Oh!

02:07:11.261 --> 02:07:12.094
LAURA: Should've done it last night,

02:07:12.094 --> 02:07:13.534
we should've done it last night!

02:07:13.534 --> 02:07:15.192
MARISHA: Yeah, did we--

02:07:15.192 --> 02:07:16.794
ASHLEY: We didn't do our thing.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:07:17.734 --> 02:07:19.014
SAM: Wisdom save.

02:07:19.884 --> 02:07:21.534
MARISHA: Wisdom save.
SAM: Oh, great.

02:07:21.534 --> 02:07:23.171
TRAVIS: 12.
MATT: All righty.

02:07:23.171 --> 02:07:25.729
SAM: Ooh. Not good.

02:07:25.729 --> 02:07:26.956
MATT: Jester?

02:07:26.956 --> 02:07:28.054
LAURA: 13.
MATT: 13.

02:07:28.054 --> 02:07:28.887
LIAM: 24.

02:07:30.104 --> 02:07:32.324
SAM: 12 plus five, 17.
MATT: 17.

02:07:32.324 --> 02:07:33.924
ASHLEY: Five.
SAM: Oh!

02:07:33.924 --> 02:07:35.434
TALIESIN: 14.

02:07:35.434 --> 02:07:36.888
MARISHA: 16.

02:07:36.888 --> 02:07:38.605
MATT: Okay.

02:07:38.605 --> 02:07:39.438
LAURA: Balls.

02:07:39.438 --> 02:07:41.494
Do we get advantage because of all the illusions on the--

02:07:41.494 --> 02:07:44.124
MARISHA: Yeah, or did it decrease the DC?

02:07:44.124 --> 02:07:45.025
MATT: No.

02:07:46.054 --> 02:07:47.412
TRAVIS: It's real pretty, though.
MATT: It is very pretty.

02:07:47.412 --> 02:07:49.074
ASHLEY: It gave advantage because I fell asleep

02:07:49.074 --> 02:07:52.413
remembering my life?
TRAVIS: For the last time.

02:07:52.413 --> 02:07:53.884
SAM: What about Vilya?

02:07:53.884 --> 02:07:55.604
What did she roll? Did she have to roll?

02:07:55.604 --> 02:07:56.624
MATT: She does have to roll.

02:07:57.644 --> 02:07:58.494
LAURA: But she just got cured.

02:07:58.494 --> 02:07:59.564
Doesn't it start over for her?

02:07:59.564 --> 02:08:00.864
Wouldn't it be like the first night for her?

02:08:00.864 --> 02:08:01.714
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:08:01.714 --> 02:08:03.524
TRAVIS: I love how you try and sell the DM.

02:08:03.524 --> 02:08:08.003
ASHLEY: I know, we're like,
"We could, we could maybe have--"

02:08:08.003 --> 02:08:10.154
TRAVIS: Haggle, haggle.

02:08:10.154 --> 02:08:13.837
LAURA: Don't know what you guys are talking about.
MATT: As consciousness comes to you...

02:08:15.584 --> 02:08:17.174
Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

02:08:17.174 --> 02:08:18.007
MATT: Yasha.

02:08:19.274 --> 02:08:21.354
You got a 17, you said?
SAM: 17.

02:08:21.354 --> 02:08:22.528
MATT: Jester and Fjord.

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:24.044
ALL: Oh!

02:08:24.044 --> 02:08:25.710
MARISHA: Oh!

02:08:27.994 --> 02:08:30.364
TRAVIS: Oh no, that's the two.
MARISHA: The two clerics.

02:08:30.364 --> 02:08:31.744
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:08:31.744 --> 02:08:33.274
MATT: As you come to consciousness,

02:08:34.234 --> 02:08:36.544
there's a bit of a pounding headache

02:08:37.384 --> 02:08:39.234
and a brief moment where you

02:08:39.234 --> 02:08:40.924
have to rub your eyes,

02:08:40.924 --> 02:08:43.474
and the bright morning sun is starting

02:08:43.474 --> 02:08:45.714
to hit the edge of the beach.

02:08:45.714 --> 02:08:47.984
The dome, thankfully, although the dome would be

02:08:47.984 --> 02:08:49.164
fading about this time,

02:08:49.164 --> 02:08:50.764
since it lasts for eight hours, right?

02:08:50.764 --> 02:08:52.354
And so it goes from the comfortable interior

02:08:52.354 --> 02:08:55.464
to the growing warmth of the sand beneath you,

02:08:55.464 --> 02:08:58.364
and you all shake yourselves awake

02:08:58.364 --> 02:09:00.324
as everyone starts gathering your things.

02:09:03.989 --> 02:09:06.229
You wake up, and Fjord,

02:09:07.094 --> 02:09:10.137
you stretch for a moment.

02:09:12.844 --> 02:09:16.014
MARISHA: Okay, we should go through the little ritual

02:09:16.014 --> 02:09:17.314
that Caduceus makes us do.

02:09:18.489 --> 02:09:19.734
SAM: Don't we do that at night?

02:09:19.734 --> 02:09:20.703
MARISHA: I thought we did it in the morning.

02:09:20.703 --> 02:09:22.347
TALIESIN and SAM: The morning and the night.

02:09:22.347 --> 02:09:24.022
SAM: Okay, sure.

02:09:27.094 --> 02:09:29.210
MARISHA: I guess I'll go first?

02:09:29.210 --> 02:09:30.694
TALIESIN: I mean, we do the round.

02:09:30.694 --> 02:09:33.584
MARISHA: I'm Beauregard Lionett

02:09:33.584 --> 02:09:37.860
from Clara and Thoreau Lionett.

02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:39.301
From Kamordah.

02:09:41.444 --> 02:09:43.194
MATT: It takes you a second.

02:09:43.194 --> 02:09:44.969
F-f-f-- It's an F name.

02:09:47.454 --> 02:09:50.424
Fjord, it's Fjord.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:09:50.424 --> 02:09:54.667
MATT: You're... here with your friends.

02:09:59.474 --> 02:10:01.964
The M--

02:10:01.964 --> 02:10:04.360
Mighty...

02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:06.504
You guys just see this blank look on Fjord's face

02:10:06.504 --> 02:10:09.734
as suddenly you're struggling to recall details.

02:10:11.694 --> 02:10:14.448
Not all of them, but some important ones.

02:10:14.448 --> 02:10:15.439
TALIESIN: Huh.

02:10:15.439 --> 02:10:16.439
TRAVIS: I...

02:10:19.654 --> 02:10:21.954
That's about it.
MARISHA: What's your mentor's name?

02:10:23.514 --> 02:10:26.564
Vuh-?
SAM: (muffled) Vandran.

02:10:26.564 --> 02:10:28.644
TRAVIS: Kranner?
(laughter)

02:10:28.644 --> 02:10:31.370
SAM: (through gritted teeth) Vandran.
TRAVIS: Kandin?

02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:32.403
MARISHA: Vey?

02:10:32.403 --> 02:10:33.384
LIAM: Ralph Kramden?

02:10:33.384 --> 02:10:34.941
TRAVIS: What is the matter with the both of them?

02:10:34.941 --> 02:10:36.254
MARISHA: Vi? (laughs)

02:10:36.254 --> 02:10:37.544
TRAVIS: I think I'm not the only one

02:10:37.544 --> 02:10:39.714
that's been affected here tonight.

02:10:39.714 --> 02:10:41.341
Vey Kamden.

02:10:44.033 --> 02:10:45.124
I don't know.

02:10:45.124 --> 02:10:45.957
MATT: Jester.

02:10:46.844 --> 02:10:49.024
In seeing this, there's a fear that strikes over you

02:10:49.024 --> 02:10:51.084
as Fjord having this challenge.

02:10:51.084 --> 02:10:52.967
And in the moment you think back to yourself also,

02:10:52.967 --> 02:10:56.944
elements, there are gaps.

02:10:56.944 --> 02:10:59.226
Caduceus.
LAURA: Is it disconcerting?

02:10:59.226 --> 02:11:01.184
Is it okay?

02:11:01.184 --> 02:11:02.454
Does it feel okay that you're forgetting?

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:04.747
MATT: It's disconcerting at first.

02:11:04.747 --> 02:11:06.594
And it's not like, everything.

02:11:06.594 --> 02:11:09.024
You remember coming to this island,

02:11:09.024 --> 02:11:11.434
you remember most of the events that happened recently,

02:11:11.434 --> 02:11:13.504
you remember the ship.

02:11:13.504 --> 02:11:14.384
Where did that ship come from?

02:11:14.384 --> 02:11:15.724
What was the ship called?

02:11:15.724 --> 02:11:18.584
TRAVIS: Do we remember that people sometimes forget things

02:11:18.584 --> 02:11:20.054
once they're here?
MATT: Yes.

02:11:20.054 --> 02:11:23.134
There's enough self-awareness where it's not a blank slate,

02:11:23.134 --> 02:11:25.884
but a lot of recent events you can recall.

02:11:26.904 --> 02:11:28.289
You remember you had a boat,

02:11:28.289 --> 02:11:29.447
and you remember it got destroyed.

02:11:29.447 --> 02:11:30.454
You don't remember what the boat was called

02:11:30.454 --> 02:11:31.754
or where you got it.

02:11:31.754 --> 02:11:35.984
You vaguely remember-- you have to have parents.

02:11:35.984 --> 02:11:37.655
TRAVIS: (stunned gasp)
SAM: Oof.

02:11:37.655 --> 02:11:41.444
TALIESIN: There was a turtle involved somehow.

02:11:41.444 --> 02:11:42.364
Were there turtles?

02:11:42.364 --> 02:11:44.334
TRAVIS: Why are you talking about turtles?

02:11:44.334 --> 02:11:46.251
TALIESIN: I'm trying to-- there was a--

02:11:47.594 --> 02:11:49.074
Huh.

02:11:49.074 --> 02:11:51.682
MARISHA: It was a dragon turtle.

02:11:51.682 --> 02:11:52.541
LAURA: What?

02:11:52.541 --> 02:11:54.967
SAM: Do you guys know how to cast spells still?

02:11:54.967 --> 02:11:55.824
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.

02:11:55.824 --> 02:11:59.207
LAURA: Yeah, I use Thaumaturgy to blow everybody's hair.

02:11:59.207 --> 02:12:02.124
SAM: Oh, my hair looks so good now.

02:12:03.678 --> 02:12:05.344
TALIESIN: Is that a trick?

02:12:05.344 --> 02:12:06.177
I don't know.

02:12:06.177 --> 02:12:07.184
SAM: Okay, that's good, that's good,

02:12:07.184 --> 02:12:10.024
they can cast spells, that's good.

02:12:10.024 --> 02:12:12.064
Vilya, how are you doing?

02:12:12.064 --> 02:12:13.304
MATT: "So far so good.

02:12:13.304 --> 02:12:17.046
"I do not believe I've been affected in the same way."

02:12:18.342 --> 02:12:20.767
TALIESIN: Anybody else having a--

02:12:21.608 --> 02:12:24.744
Whatever?
MATT: She rubs her hands together and,

02:12:24.744 --> 02:12:25.934
"I get to return the favor,"

02:12:25.934 --> 02:12:27.574
and she reaches out and touches your shoulder,

02:12:27.574 --> 02:12:29.164
casting Greater Restoration,

02:12:29.164 --> 02:12:31.546
and all your memories rush back to you.

02:12:31.546 --> 02:12:33.963
Let me mark off her casting there.

02:12:35.394 --> 02:12:36.510
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:38.807
LAURA: How do you feel?
TALIESIN: Much better.

02:12:38.807 --> 02:12:41.056
Oh, I didn't like that.

02:12:41.056 --> 02:12:42.304
Mm, wow.

02:12:42.304 --> 02:12:44.104
TRAVIS: Is it only you and I?

02:12:44.104 --> 02:12:45.696
SAM: Yashie?

02:12:45.696 --> 02:12:47.814
ASHLEY: I--

02:12:47.814 --> 02:12:48.647
SAM: Can you--

02:12:50.354 --> 02:12:52.104
Can you still juggle?

02:12:53.754 --> 02:12:55.474
ASHLEY: I think so.

02:12:55.474 --> 02:12:57.141
SAM: You should try.

02:12:59.434 --> 02:13:01.584
ASHLEY: Did I know how to juggle?
SAM: Yes.

02:13:01.584 --> 02:13:03.577
TRAVIS: That seems familiar.

02:13:04.794 --> 02:13:06.394
LAURA: Yeah, I remember you juggling.

02:13:06.394 --> 02:13:08.141
ASHLEY: You remember? I feel like I have a vague memory--

02:13:08.141 --> 02:13:09.054
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:13:09.054 --> 02:13:11.014
That's one of my strongest memories, actually.

02:13:11.014 --> 02:13:13.260
SAM: Two balls, or two rocks.
TRAVIS: Here's a couple of stones. Here.

02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:15.510
SAM: Just two for at first.

02:13:16.394 --> 02:13:18.884
MATT: Make a--

02:13:18.884 --> 02:13:20.684
SAM: What check is this?

02:13:20.684 --> 02:13:22.249
Go to the manual.

02:13:22.249 --> 02:13:23.834
Go to the Player's Handbook.

02:13:23.834 --> 02:13:24.667
TRAVIS: Performance?

02:13:24.667 --> 02:13:25.934
LAURA: Would that be a dexterity?

02:13:25.934 --> 02:13:27.844
MATT: I'm trying to--

02:13:27.844 --> 02:13:30.054
No, for this it would be dexterity.

02:13:30.054 --> 02:13:31.734
Make a dexterity check.
ASHLEY: With advantage?

02:13:31.734 --> 02:13:33.668
MATT: Not a saving throw, just a check.

02:13:33.668 --> 02:13:34.501
ASHLEY: Just a check?

02:13:34.501 --> 02:13:36.226
MATT: Yeah, so add the modifier for your dexterity.

02:13:36.226 --> 02:13:38.756
ASHLEY: Oh, well.
(laughter)

02:13:38.756 --> 02:13:40.514
ASHLEY: Seven.
MATT: Okay.

02:13:40.514 --> 02:13:43.624
MATT: So--
ASHLEY: I forgot how to juggle!

02:13:43.624 --> 02:13:45.724
MATT: As one hits her in the eye.

02:13:47.324 --> 02:13:50.444
ASHLEY: I've forgotten.

02:13:50.444 --> 02:13:51.454
SAM: Oh no, Yasha.

02:13:51.454 --> 02:13:52.754
LIAM: That is vaguely amusing,

02:13:52.754 --> 02:13:54.754
but this is a little frightening.

02:13:54.754 --> 02:13:56.470
MARISHA: What about you, Caleb?

02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:57.954
LIAM: I'm fine.

02:13:57.954 --> 02:14:00.164
My parents are Una and Leofric,

02:14:00.164 --> 02:14:02.484
and my name is Caleb Widogast, sometimes.

02:14:02.484 --> 02:14:03.854
SAM: I'm Veth Brenatto.

02:14:03.854 --> 02:14:06.538
My parents are Travis and Ashley.

02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:08.424
(laughter)

02:14:08.424 --> 02:14:09.934
TALIESIN: I can't.

02:14:09.934 --> 02:14:10.767
All right.

02:14:14.804 --> 02:14:16.634
ASHLEY: I am Yasha.

02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:24.074
I don't know my parents,

02:14:24.074 --> 02:14:28.464
but I don't know if I did.

02:14:28.464 --> 02:14:30.594
MARISHA: Yeah, no, that tracks.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:14:30.594 --> 02:14:31.894
MARISHA: Yeah, you didn't really.

02:14:33.125 --> 02:14:35.025
Do you remember the name of your wife?

02:14:39.424 --> 02:14:41.524
LIAM: What about your old purple friend?

02:14:43.454 --> 02:14:44.374
MATT: You remember a coat.

02:14:44.374 --> 02:14:46.604
Did you wear that coat?

02:14:46.604 --> 02:14:48.177
You don't think you'd wear a colorful coat,

02:14:48.177 --> 02:14:49.166
but you must've worn it.

02:14:49.166 --> 02:14:50.416
There was a coat.

02:14:53.704 --> 02:14:55.295
ASHLEY: I'm--

02:14:57.934 --> 02:14:59.454
SAM: Can you help her?
ASHLEY: I don't like this feeling.

02:14:59.454 --> 02:15:01.164
SAM: Can you help her, Caduceus?

02:15:01.164 --> 02:15:03.584
TALIESIN: Who do you want to take and who should I take?

02:15:03.584 --> 02:15:04.794
LAURA: What are you talking about?

02:15:04.794 --> 02:15:08.274
TALIESIN: Oh, sorry, I'm going to Greater Restoration.

02:15:08.274 --> 02:15:09.674
MATT: Okay.

02:15:09.674 --> 02:15:10.864
Mark off a slot there.

02:15:10.864 --> 02:15:13.118
And you have your memories returned to you.

02:15:13.118 --> 02:15:14.104
LAURA: Ay!

02:15:14.104 --> 02:15:17.594
My name's Jester, my mom's the Ruby of the Sea.

02:15:17.594 --> 02:15:20.910
My dad is Babenon Dosaal,

02:15:20.910 --> 02:15:23.536
also known as The Gentleman.

02:15:23.536 --> 02:15:24.844
TRAVIS: These are incredible names.

02:15:24.844 --> 02:15:26.744
Did you make them up?

02:15:26.744 --> 02:15:27.894
LAURA: No.

02:15:27.894 --> 02:15:30.419
They existed before I was ever born.

02:15:31.384 --> 02:15:32.767
I'm going to--

02:15:32.767 --> 02:15:34.194
TRAVIS: Feel like that's important.

02:15:34.194 --> 02:15:36.714
LAURA: I'm going to pat Fjord on the top of his head

02:15:36.714 --> 02:15:38.503
and Greater Restoration him.

02:15:38.503 --> 02:15:39.336
TRAVIS: (whooshing)

02:15:39.336 --> 02:15:41.340
LAURA: Be blessed, my child.

02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:42.639
TRAVIS: (southern drawl) It's nice to see you--

02:15:42.639 --> 02:15:44.580
(British accent) Nope, no, nope.

02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:47.488
(laughter)

02:15:48.344 --> 02:15:49.619
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:15:51.734 --> 02:15:53.834
MATT: Vilya approaches you and says,

02:15:55.874 --> 02:15:58.474
"One should not forget someone so important,"

02:15:58.474 --> 02:16:01.114
and uses her other 5th-level slot

02:16:01.114 --> 02:16:03.504
to cast Greater Restoration and cleanse you as well.

02:16:03.504 --> 02:16:05.362
TALIESIN: Beat me to it, all right.

02:16:06.914 --> 02:16:09.754
SAM: How many more times can any of you do that today?

02:16:11.074 --> 02:16:13.334
Two more for you, one more for you.

02:16:13.334 --> 02:16:15.262
LAURA: Well, technically two.

02:16:15.262 --> 02:16:16.894
TALIESIN: Technically two for me, too.

02:16:16.894 --> 02:16:19.314
TRAVIS: Those are the big boys for them.

02:16:19.314 --> 02:16:22.401
TALIESIN: That wipes all the big stuff.

02:16:22.401 --> 02:16:23.769
SAM: Okay.

02:16:23.769 --> 02:16:28.367
TRAVIS: You know what happens when you
wipe the big stuff around the b-- (laughs)

02:16:28.367 --> 02:16:32.634
TALIESIN: Especially while
we're going right into the butthole.

02:16:32.634 --> 02:16:34.562
MATT: I also need everyone to make an investigation check.

02:16:34.562 --> 02:16:35.551
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:16:35.551 --> 02:16:37.143
LAURA: Oh, we're going to--
TRAVIS: We just woke up.

02:16:37.143 --> 02:16:39.506
LAURA: Missing our stuff.
LIAM: Oh man.

02:16:39.506 --> 02:16:40.614
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.
LIAM: Oh man.

02:16:40.614 --> 02:16:41.964
LAURA: Ah man, come on, man.

02:16:41.964 --> 02:16:42.797
TRAVIS: Eight.
TALIESIN: Boo.

02:16:42.797 --> 02:16:45.329
MARISHA: Shit.
TALIESIN: I'm putting this die away. It's awful.

02:16:45.329 --> 02:16:47.701
TRAVIS: Roll it fast.
LAURA: Investigation.

02:16:47.701 --> 02:16:50.759
MARISHA: Do I get advantage or something because I'm cool?

02:16:50.759 --> 02:16:52.267
MATT: No.
ASHLEY: "Because I'm cool."

02:16:52.267 --> 02:16:54.514
(laughter)

02:16:54.514 --> 02:16:56.496
LAURA: 16.
MATT: 16, okay.

02:16:56.496 --> 02:16:58.343
LIAM: I rolled balls. 14.
MATT: 14, okay.

02:16:58.343 --> 02:17:00.017
MARISHA: Oh, shit.
SAM: I rolled a four,

02:17:00.017 --> 02:17:02.910
but rogues, 21.
MARISHA: Rolled a nine, that wasn't great.

02:17:02.910 --> 02:17:03.743
TRAVIS: Fuck.

02:17:03.743 --> 02:17:05.874
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: How.

02:17:05.874 --> 02:17:07.584
ASHLEY: 18.
MATT: Okay.

02:17:07.584 --> 02:17:08.984
TALIESIN: Three.
MATT: Okay.

02:17:08.984 --> 02:17:10.584
MARISHA: 17.
MATT: 17.

02:17:10.584 --> 02:17:11.474
Okay.

02:17:11.474 --> 02:17:13.174
While you have your memories back,

02:17:14.134 --> 02:17:16.842
Caduceus and Fjord.

02:17:18.251 --> 02:17:19.651
And what'd you roll, Jester you said?

02:17:21.044 --> 02:17:22.384
LAURA: 16.
MATT: A 16.

02:17:22.384 --> 02:17:23.674
Ah yes, so Caduceus and Fjord,

02:17:23.674 --> 02:17:25.484
I need you both to choose an object

02:17:25.484 --> 02:17:27.621
within your equipment--
MARISHA: Oh, this shit.

02:17:27.621 --> 02:17:29.534
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: The what?

02:17:29.534 --> 02:17:30.900
MATT: Choose something in your equipment.

02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:33.142
An object, an item, something that you have

02:17:33.142 --> 02:17:34.111
that you carry on yourself.

02:17:34.111 --> 02:17:37.247
SAM: Damn, this island sucks.
MARISHA: Yeah, it does.

02:17:37.247 --> 02:17:39.463
LIAM: I don't like it here.
SAM: I love it.

02:17:41.969 --> 02:17:43.111
TRAVIS: I have a hammer.

02:17:43.977 --> 02:17:45.844
SAM: ♪ If I had a-- ♪
MATT: Not anymore you don't.

02:17:45.844 --> 02:17:47.644
TALIESIN: My fucking hat.

02:17:47.644 --> 02:17:50.858
MATT: Make a note that you lost a hammer.

02:17:50.858 --> 02:17:52.162
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:17:52.162 --> 02:17:53.991
TALIESIN: There goes my damn hat.

02:17:53.991 --> 02:17:56.544
LAURA: Oh, your hat?
MATT: Caduceus lost his hat.

02:17:56.544 --> 02:17:58.868
SAM: Oh, your awesome hat? Your straw hat?

02:17:58.868 --> 02:18:00.781
TALIESIN: My straw hat.
MATT: Make a note that you lost your hat.

02:18:00.781 --> 02:18:02.254
TALIESIN: I already deleted it.

02:18:02.254 --> 02:18:05.333
LAURA: Did I lose my hair oil or my beard oil?

02:18:05.333 --> 02:18:06.841
SAM: (gasps) You can't remember.
MATT: Hair oil.

02:18:06.841 --> 02:18:09.082
ASHLEY: I think your hair oil.
LAURA: Okay.

02:18:09.082 --> 02:18:10.098
TRAVIS: Hair oil.

02:18:11.149 --> 02:18:12.499
SAM: (laughs)

02:18:12.499 --> 02:18:15.064
LAURA: Ah, man, my hair oil's gone.

02:18:15.064 --> 02:18:16.463
TRAVIS: The prickle.

02:18:16.463 --> 02:18:17.829
MATT: Just missing.

02:18:17.829 --> 02:18:21.074
Like they were pilfered in your sleep.

02:18:21.074 --> 02:18:23.584
LAURA: I swear--
LIAM: Did you misplace it?

02:18:23.584 --> 02:18:26.151
LAURA: Well--
LIAM: Did you check in the haversack?

02:18:26.151 --> 02:18:29.770
LAURA: Well, I had it next to my beard oil.

02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:32.114
LIAM: Do you have your beard oil?
LAURA: Well, yeah.

02:18:32.114 --> 02:18:34.144
SAM: Why do you have beard oil?

02:18:34.144 --> 02:18:35.924
LAURA: Well, because it was a present

02:18:35.924 --> 02:18:37.724
that I never gave to Fjord.

02:18:37.724 --> 02:18:39.831
Or maybe I did give it to him.

02:18:39.831 --> 02:18:41.031
Did I ever give you a present, Fjord?

02:18:41.031 --> 02:18:43.074
SAM: Why don't you give it to him now?

02:18:43.074 --> 02:18:45.326
MARISHA: I definitely feel like
it was just an impulse purchase.

02:18:45.326 --> 02:18:47.738
I don't know if you had a point
to buying it when you got it.

02:18:47.738 --> 02:18:49.454
LAURA: I did get it for you.

02:18:49.454 --> 02:18:51.854
ASHLEY: What's the difference
between hair oil and beard oil?

02:18:51.854 --> 02:18:54.318
SAM: Good question.
LIAM: Very different.

02:18:54.318 --> 02:18:57.114
TRAVIS: They both smell terrible.
LIAM: There's a very different consistency

02:18:57.114 --> 02:18:59.384
with the hair on your head
to the hair on your face, which is--

02:18:59.384 --> 02:19:00.317
LAURA: I don't--

02:19:01.364 --> 02:19:03.348
LIAM: Growing in.
LAURA: Yeah, I don't know.

02:19:04.192 --> 02:19:06.664
It's to make your beard grow better.

02:19:06.664 --> 02:19:07.497
TRAVIS: Oh!

02:19:09.062 --> 02:19:10.999
(sniffs)

02:19:10.999 --> 02:19:13.744
LAURA: It might make your face smell really bad.

02:19:13.744 --> 02:19:17.794
TRAVIS: I'll use it so much.
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:19:17.794 --> 02:19:19.634
LAURA: You were having trouble when I bought it.

02:19:19.634 --> 02:19:21.074
I just forgot that I got it for you.

02:19:21.074 --> 02:19:23.434
TRAVIS: Trouble with what?
LAURA: Growing your beard.

02:19:23.434 --> 02:19:25.814
TRAVIS: It's not. (laughs) Ah. Ha.

02:19:25.814 --> 02:19:26.647
TALIESIN: Oh, he doesn't remember.

02:19:26.647 --> 02:19:28.436
TRAVIS: I'm not having trouble.
TALIESIN: Oh, we got to do it again.

02:19:28.436 --> 02:19:31.934
TRAVIS: It's just slower than most.

02:19:31.934 --> 02:19:33.924
I'm not having trouble.

02:19:33.924 --> 02:19:34.904
LAURA: It looks good now.

02:19:34.904 --> 02:19:38.934
It was back then, you know, it was kind of dinky.

02:19:38.934 --> 02:19:42.664
But now it's nice and full, Fjord.

02:19:42.664 --> 02:19:44.657
Looks good.
TRAVIS: I want to forget.

02:19:44.657 --> 02:19:46.761
(laughter)

02:19:46.761 --> 02:19:48.035
MARISHA: Take it back.

02:19:49.748 --> 02:19:50.794
TRAVIS: Thank you.
LAURA: You're welcome.

02:19:50.794 --> 02:19:53.324
MATT: So you've gathered most of your things,

02:19:53.324 --> 02:19:56.144
those of you who have all your things still.

02:19:56.144 --> 02:19:58.274
The day is yours, what would you like to do?

02:19:58.274 --> 02:19:59.674
SAM: What would we like to do?

02:19:59.674 --> 02:20:01.834
We came here to piss off Vokodo--

02:20:01.834 --> 02:20:03.104
LAURA: You better put that in your equipment.

02:20:03.104 --> 02:20:05.134
SAM: I'm sorry, the Guacamole.
LAURA: Beard oil.

02:20:05.134 --> 02:20:07.334
SAM: And we've discovered, Beau and I discovered

02:20:07.334 --> 02:20:08.964
that the rift is under the water.

02:20:08.964 --> 02:20:10.214
TRAVIS: I don't know how to do that.

02:20:10.214 --> 02:20:13.164
SAM: And that it is spewing forth water.

02:20:13.164 --> 02:20:16.754
MARISHA: Yeah, I found the tear, found the planal tear.

02:20:16.754 --> 02:20:19.774
SAM: Doesn't seem like that's
an actionable item on our list.

02:20:19.774 --> 02:20:22.024
We're not going to go through the rift.

02:20:22.024 --> 02:20:24.124
MATT: You said "planal tear," right?

02:20:24.124 --> 02:20:25.717
MARISHA: Yeah, I did.
MATT: Okay.

02:20:25.717 --> 02:20:26.584
(laughter)

02:20:26.584 --> 02:20:27.714
MARISHA: I know we're in the butthole,

02:20:27.714 --> 02:20:29.293
but I did say "planal tear."

02:20:29.293 --> 02:20:31.036
MATT: Just.
(laughter)

02:20:31.036 --> 02:20:31.987
LAURA: Vilya!

02:20:31.987 --> 02:20:35.234
That's where you came out of!

02:20:35.234 --> 02:20:37.144
MATT: "That certainly makes sense.

02:20:37.144 --> 02:20:39.126
"You're not wrong."

02:20:39.126 --> 02:20:42.384
TALIESIN: I think we should take a look around it, see if--

02:20:42.384 --> 02:20:45.056
SAM: We, I mean, Beau, did last night and--

02:20:45.056 --> 02:20:46.396
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: -- didn't see much.

02:20:46.396 --> 02:20:48.884
MARISHA: It's about 50, 60 feet down,

02:20:48.884 --> 02:20:52.974
about 20 feet apart, or wide.

02:20:52.974 --> 02:20:53.894
SAM: It's not glowing.

02:20:53.894 --> 02:20:55.314
TALIESIN: Does it disappear at the top?

02:20:55.314 --> 02:20:57.967
Does it turn into--
MARISHA: It's just like a--

02:20:59.824 --> 02:21:02.524
It's just like a spout, like a funnel.

02:21:02.524 --> 02:21:04.334
Although, it is pretty interesting

02:21:04.334 --> 02:21:07.492
that it has such a narrow,

02:21:07.492 --> 02:21:10.175
consistent flow to it.

02:21:10.175 --> 02:21:12.534
TALIESIN: Does it turn into a river at the top, or?

02:21:13.654 --> 02:21:15.544
MARISHA: Yeah, it goes into the mountain

02:21:15.544 --> 02:21:17.044
and then kind of, right?

02:21:17.044 --> 02:21:18.644
TRAVIS: It's like a geyser.
SAM: It's a geyser.

02:21:18.644 --> 02:21:19.874
MARISHA: It's a geyser.

02:21:19.874 --> 02:21:22.214
MATT: There's the fountain jets

02:21:22.214 --> 02:21:23.554
that you see that stream up

02:21:23.554 --> 02:21:24.954
and then crash onto the top part,

02:21:24.954 --> 02:21:26.744
it's like that at a little more of a steeper angle,

02:21:26.744 --> 02:21:27.874
but then breaks.
TALIESIN: But then goes

02:21:27.874 --> 02:21:28.886
into a river that goes--

02:21:28.886 --> 02:21:30.904
LAURA: It's like the Happy Fun Ball!

02:21:30.904 --> 02:21:33.074
Don't you remember when we were in the Happy Fun Ball?

02:21:33.074 --> 02:21:34.244
At one point we went through a door

02:21:34.244 --> 02:21:35.214
and it felt like we were falling,

02:21:35.214 --> 02:21:38.034
and then all of a sudden we weren't falling, we were--

02:21:38.034 --> 02:21:39.254
MARISHA: I thought about that.
SAM: Yeah, we twisted

02:21:39.254 --> 02:21:41.174
and went into another place.
MARISHA: I thought if it was,

02:21:41.174 --> 02:21:42.864
like, a Reverse Gravity thing.

02:21:42.864 --> 02:21:46.134
LAURA: Yeah, what if it's falling down in the other plane?

02:21:46.134 --> 02:21:47.264
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

02:21:47.264 --> 02:21:49.244
MARISHA: I think it could be.

02:21:49.244 --> 02:21:52.812
SAM: But there's nothing that we can do with this knowledge,

02:21:52.812 --> 02:21:56.084
or access to this item, so--

02:21:56.084 --> 02:21:58.694
TALIESIN: Do you think it's--

02:21:58.694 --> 02:22:03.244
That's where the water in his cave?

02:22:03.244 --> 02:22:05.854
MARISHA: When I was over there, does it go into the lava?

02:22:05.854 --> 02:22:07.734
TRAVIS: We also flew in at night, right?

02:22:07.734 --> 02:22:10.364
Should one of us just go straight up and see in the daylight

02:22:10.364 --> 02:22:11.197
if there's anything else--

02:22:11.197 --> 02:22:15.094
MATT: It's flush with the cliff face,

02:22:15.094 --> 02:22:16.604
like, shooting up

02:22:16.604 --> 02:22:19.074
and eventually crashing up on top

02:22:19.074 --> 02:22:20.964
of where the lip of the cliff is,

02:22:20.964 --> 02:22:22.974
and it cascades down into the--

02:22:22.974 --> 02:22:25.744
LAURA: There's nobody behind the waterfall, I'll bet you.

02:22:25.744 --> 02:22:28.484
LIAM: I will, while this debate is
happening in front of Caleb,

02:22:28.484 --> 02:22:32.134
he summons Frumpkin and sends him up

02:22:32.134 --> 02:22:34.934
and slaps his hand on Beauregard's shoulder,

02:22:34.934 --> 02:22:37.184
and I'm going to send him,

02:22:37.184 --> 02:22:40.334
fly all around the top of the bidet geyser

02:22:40.334 --> 02:22:43.267
and look for entrances, caves, anything.

02:22:43.267 --> 02:22:44.575
Thank you.
MATT: Perception check.

02:22:44.575 --> 02:22:48.124
LIAM: That's the other way.
(laughter)

02:22:48.124 --> 02:22:49.574
SAM: There it is.
MARISHA: I think that would work.

02:22:49.574 --> 02:22:51.172
TRAVIS: A long stick.
SAM: Maybe.

02:22:51.172 --> 02:22:53.824
LIAM: Curse you, Frumpkin, curse you!

02:22:53.824 --> 02:22:56.574
Two.
MARISHA: Two?

02:22:56.574 --> 02:23:00.414
MATT: You can see the spray,
you can see the network of pools

02:23:00.414 --> 02:23:04.454
and dribbling water that is making its way down,

02:23:04.454 --> 02:23:06.764
but hard to make out details at this distance,

02:23:06.764 --> 02:23:08.724
especially with the early morning,

02:23:08.724 --> 02:23:10.674
the light is hitting the sea spray,

02:23:10.674 --> 02:23:12.314
and the mist that surrounds a lot of the island

02:23:12.314 --> 02:23:15.364
just obfuscates a lot of the detail.

02:23:15.364 --> 02:23:20.224
LAURA: Is Vokodo-- is the volcano still
red and smoky and stuff?

02:23:20.224 --> 02:23:22.757
Does it still look angry this morning?

02:23:23.774 --> 02:23:25.054
MATT: You can look up and you can see

02:23:25.054 --> 02:23:27.664
the smoke itself is still thick,

02:23:27.664 --> 02:23:29.264
thicker than it's been since you've arrived,

02:23:29.264 --> 02:23:31.354
so the anger hasn't subsided,

02:23:31.354 --> 02:23:34.104
but it isn't erupting vehemently.

02:23:34.104 --> 02:23:38.904
There is a slow trickle of molten rock still.

02:23:38.904 --> 02:23:42.024
You can see elements of the glowing streams

02:23:42.024 --> 02:23:44.644
that have zigzagged down the side of the mountain,

02:23:44.644 --> 02:23:46.664
but because it's not as extreme

02:23:46.664 --> 02:23:48.762
it cools about halfway down.

02:23:49.964 --> 02:23:52.804
But it looks like there is still a--

02:23:55.044 --> 02:23:57.514
If this were connected somehow to Vokodo's emotional state,

02:23:57.514 --> 02:24:00.664
probably a still bit of frustration lingering.

02:24:00.664 --> 02:24:02.964
LIAM: What time in the morning is it?

02:24:02.964 --> 02:24:04.114
MATT: At this point, if you guys have gotten up

02:24:04.114 --> 02:24:04.947
and gone through all this,

02:24:04.947 --> 02:24:06.984
I'd say it's close to 7:00, 7:30.

02:24:06.984 --> 02:24:08.084
7:30.
LIAM: So Fjord,

02:24:08.084 --> 02:24:12.517
we have five hours until

02:24:12.517 --> 02:24:14.294
we can not breathe underwater.

02:24:14.294 --> 02:24:15.127
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:24:15.127 --> 02:24:15.960
LIAM: So my question would be,

02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:18.614
is it worth our time to collectively have

02:24:18.614 --> 02:24:21.964
a real search around the base of this portal,

02:24:21.964 --> 02:24:24.244
this jet of water?
TALIESIN: I think while we're here.

02:24:24.244 --> 02:24:26.174
LIAM: Or do we--
MARISHA: Might as well.

02:24:26.174 --> 02:24:28.004
LIAM: Take what we've gotten and walk?

02:24:28.004 --> 02:24:29.904
Fold 'em and go to the other location.

02:24:31.104 --> 02:24:32.914
MARISHA: It's always good to do a daylight check.

02:24:32.914 --> 02:24:36.024
LIAM: Could spend a couple hours.
TALIESIN: Couple hours.

02:24:36.024 --> 02:24:39.137
MARISHA: And then we can always
hop over to the Ruins from here.

02:24:39.137 --> 02:24:40.712
Yeah. Is that a plan?
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:24:40.712 --> 02:24:43.324
TALIESIN: I like that plan.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:24:43.324 --> 02:24:44.454
MATT and TALIESIN: All right.

02:24:45.294 --> 02:24:46.544
MATT: So what are you guys all doing?

02:24:46.544 --> 02:24:49.714
You're all heading through the water below,

02:24:49.714 --> 02:24:50.994
or through the cliff up top?

02:24:50.994 --> 02:24:51.964
What are you doing?

02:24:51.964 --> 02:24:53.264
TALIESIN: I'd say we start at the water below

02:24:53.264 --> 02:24:54.604
and then we do the cliff up top.

02:24:54.604 --> 02:24:56.664
LIAM: Yeah, let's try to fan out and see

02:24:56.664 --> 02:24:59.014
if there's anything amiss underneath.

02:24:59.884 --> 02:25:01.111
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Including behind it.

02:25:01.111 --> 02:25:02.254
LIAM: Decide after that.

02:25:02.254 --> 02:25:03.337
MARISHA: I went in and I went pretty deep

02:25:03.337 --> 02:25:04.974
down into the pool.

02:25:04.974 --> 02:25:08.784
I don't know if I would recommend going into the stream,

02:25:08.784 --> 02:25:10.434
although it is very tempting,

02:25:10.434 --> 02:25:12.594
I almost did it, but didn't want to die.

02:25:12.594 --> 02:25:14.424
TRAVIS: I'm a pretty good swimmer, I'll try it.

02:25:14.424 --> 02:25:17.314
I'll summon the sword and cast See Invisibility also

02:25:17.314 --> 02:25:20.084
for the next hour.
MATT: Okay, fair enough.

02:25:20.084 --> 02:25:21.994
Summon the sword.

02:25:21.994 --> 02:25:24.794
Nothing distinctly catches your attention at the moment,

02:25:24.794 --> 02:25:27.184
but you are now seeing invisible.

02:25:27.184 --> 02:25:29.434
LIAM: I'm going to take a little time to put my books

02:25:29.434 --> 02:25:31.394
and anything that I don't want water damaged

02:25:31.394 --> 02:25:33.494
into Widogast's Vault of Amber.

02:25:33.494 --> 02:25:34.794
MATT: Okay.

02:25:34.794 --> 02:25:39.794
LIAM: And strip off some of the heavier clothes

02:25:39.824 --> 02:25:41.544
and go looking in the water.

02:25:41.544 --> 02:25:44.104
And I also want to look for pearls at the same time

02:25:44.104 --> 02:25:45.454
as I'm searching.
MATT: Okay.

02:25:47.014 --> 02:25:48.034
All right, so you guys are all now

02:25:48.034 --> 02:25:50.204
just swimming into the inlet

02:25:50.204 --> 02:25:51.744
that heads to the interior

02:25:51.744 --> 02:25:55.254
of where the waterfall meets the edge of the cliff, okay.

02:25:55.254 --> 02:25:56.087
As you guys all begin

02:25:56.087 --> 02:25:57.834
swimming out into that--
SAM: I'm walking.

02:25:57.834 --> 02:25:58.854
MATT: You're walking on the top, of course.

02:25:58.854 --> 02:25:59.829
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

02:25:59.829 --> 02:26:01.794
MATT: But you make your way to the edge.

02:26:01.794 --> 02:26:03.894
Caleb, if you want to go ahead and make a--

02:26:05.744 --> 02:26:06.577
If you're looking for pearls,

02:26:06.577 --> 02:26:08.564
this is less about just looking and seeing,

02:26:08.564 --> 02:26:11.174
this is about combing the floor of the water beneath,

02:26:11.174 --> 02:26:12.874
and that'll be consuming a bit of your time,

02:26:12.874 --> 02:26:13.707
as they're probably going to be able

02:26:13.707 --> 02:26:15.624
to get to do other things--

02:26:15.624 --> 02:26:16.534
LIAM: I'm going to trust in my friends

02:26:16.534 --> 02:26:18.364
to find what we're actually looking for--

02:26:18.364 --> 02:26:22.304
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check for me.
LIAM: -- and I'll look for spell components.

02:26:22.304 --> 02:26:24.174
Good, 27.
MATT: 27, okay.

02:26:24.174 --> 02:26:26.522
So you'll spend some time doing this,

02:26:26.522 --> 02:26:28.758
but you get the sense that

02:26:28.758 --> 02:26:33.614
this is probably an area rife with the necessary situation

02:26:33.614 --> 02:26:37.774
to find pearls and clams and such that would create them,

02:26:37.774 --> 02:26:39.176
oysters, things like that.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:26:39.176 --> 02:26:42.194
LAURA: (laughs) Pearl oysters.
MATT: Pearl oysters.

02:26:42.194 --> 02:26:44.079
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Ploysters.

02:26:45.606 --> 02:26:47.104
TRAVIS: I want to see the stream, you want to go?

02:26:47.104 --> 02:26:49.424
MARISHA: Yeah, that sword can light up under water, right?

02:26:49.424 --> 02:26:50.504
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I want to look, too.

02:26:50.504 --> 02:26:52.097
MARISHA: It's dark.

02:26:52.097 --> 02:26:52.930
All right.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:26:52.930 --> 02:26:53.964
TALIESIN: I cast a Light on your hand

02:26:53.964 --> 02:26:57.835
so you have a flashlight.
MARISHA: (whooshing)

02:26:57.835 --> 02:27:00.374
MATT: The gloves emanate and--
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

02:27:00.374 --> 02:27:03.674
MATT: Vibrating glow. The two of you are helming this first?

02:27:03.674 --> 02:27:04.894
The rest of you are staying behind?

02:27:04.894 --> 02:27:05.728
TALIESIN: I'm just taking a general look around--

02:27:05.728 --> 02:27:06.837
ASHLEY: You want to go?
MARISHA: Yasha.

02:27:06.837 --> 02:27:07.911
TALIESIN: -- to see if there's anything weird.

02:27:07.911 --> 02:27:09.420
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Yasha's joining, too.

02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:10.344
ASHLEY: I'm going to go.
MATT: Okay.

02:27:10.344 --> 02:27:12.214
So the three of you are heading down below,

02:27:12.214 --> 02:27:13.294
Caleb is searching for pearls,

02:27:13.294 --> 02:27:15.464
Veth is staying above on top of the surface,

02:27:15.464 --> 02:27:16.824
and Caduceus is watching from above.

02:27:16.824 --> 02:27:18.553
Jester, what are you doing?

02:27:18.553 --> 02:27:19.874
LAURA: I'm going to look for pearls.

02:27:19.874 --> 02:27:22.764
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check as well.

02:27:22.764 --> 02:27:24.384
SAM: How high is the cliff face

02:27:24.384 --> 02:27:26.824
that the water is shooting up on top?

02:27:27.824 --> 02:27:29.874
MATT: You'd guess probably between 120 to 150 feet.

02:27:29.874 --> 02:27:32.774
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ, that is a powerful fucking geyser.

02:27:32.774 --> 02:27:35.364
MATT: Yeah, it is.
TRAVIS: Might change this.

02:27:35.364 --> 02:27:37.077
SAM: Were we going to check on top, too?

02:27:37.077 --> 02:27:38.152
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:27:38.152 --> 02:27:39.593
SAM: I'll check on top.
LAURA: Oh, is that what I should do?

02:27:39.593 --> 02:27:41.984
SAM: No, no, I mean sure, or I can.

02:27:41.984 --> 02:27:43.164
It's up to you.

02:27:43.164 --> 02:27:45.324
LAURA: I rolled a three on pearls.

02:27:45.324 --> 02:27:47.824
MATT: Okay, so you're searching for a while.

02:27:47.824 --> 02:27:49.014
And it's beautiful.

02:27:49.014 --> 02:27:51.444
There's actually hints of coral underneath here,

02:27:51.444 --> 02:27:53.734
and now that light is coming through

02:27:53.734 --> 02:27:55.544
from the sun rising in the sky.

02:27:55.544 --> 02:27:57.684
You can start seeing all the fish that live down here.

02:27:57.684 --> 02:27:59.119
LAURA: Whoa!

02:27:59.119 --> 02:28:01.414
MATT: It's a vibrant ecosystem.

02:28:01.414 --> 02:28:02.734
And you forget pearls entirely.

02:28:02.734 --> 02:28:04.342
You're just now looking at all the beautiful creatures.

02:28:04.342 --> 02:28:06.007
LAURA: So beautiful!
TRAVIS: Om nom nom nom nom.

02:28:06.007 --> 02:28:07.064
ASHLEY: Om nom nom nom nom.

02:28:07.064 --> 02:28:07.897
MATT: And as you're watching,

02:28:07.897 --> 02:28:11.634
you watch Caleb just come by and go (grasping).

02:28:11.634 --> 02:28:13.294
LAURA: Oh, pearls, I forgot.

02:28:14.972 --> 02:28:15.954
(laughter)

02:28:15.954 --> 02:28:18.954
SAM: I'm going to cast Levitate
and start rising up the side.

02:28:18.954 --> 02:28:20.394
TALIESIN: I can't go up, I'm going to
look behind the waterfall.

02:28:20.394 --> 02:28:21.906
MATT: Okay.
SAM: It'll take a while.

02:28:21.906 --> 02:28:22.824
MATT: It will.
MARISHA: Behind that waterfall.

02:28:22.824 --> 02:28:23.982
MATT: Slowly making your way.

02:28:23.982 --> 02:28:25.034
TALIESIN: I'm going to look behind the waterfall

02:28:25.034 --> 02:28:27.534
because I can't float.
MATT: Okay.

02:28:27.534 --> 02:28:30.004
So you're going to attempt to peer beyond the water.

02:28:30.004 --> 02:28:32.494
TALIESIN: I'm going to go, like the Jungle Cruise,

02:28:32.494 --> 02:28:34.234
I'm going to go on the back side of the water.

02:28:34.234 --> 02:28:35.324
MATT: Okay.

02:28:35.324 --> 02:28:36.744
As you head towards the edge,

02:28:36.744 --> 02:28:38.834
the water itself is pretty much

02:28:38.834 --> 02:28:39.674
right up against the cliff

02:28:39.674 --> 02:28:41.534
and splashing alongside and up.

02:28:41.534 --> 02:28:43.824
Make a perception check.
SAM: Come on, buddy.

02:28:43.824 --> 02:28:44.884
TALIESIN: Let's have one good roll today.

02:28:44.884 --> 02:28:46.466
MARISHA: Big, big big roll.

02:28:46.466 --> 02:28:48.167
TALIESIN: Ah, 21.
SAM: Hey.

02:28:48.167 --> 02:28:49.000
MATT: 21.

02:28:49.864 --> 02:28:51.424
The way the light's hitting the water,

02:28:51.424 --> 02:28:52.859
you can see--

02:28:56.504 --> 02:28:59.064
It looks like there is just rock behind it,

02:28:59.064 --> 02:29:01.714
like it is just a rock flat surface

02:29:01.714 --> 02:29:05.524
that the water is flush against, almost,

02:29:05.524 --> 02:29:07.374
but there is maybe a slight gap

02:29:07.374 --> 02:29:09.494
as it's just jettisoning up in the same shape

02:29:09.494 --> 02:29:10.874
and trajectory as the stone,

02:29:10.874 --> 02:29:12.434
as if it's either sheered itself,

02:29:12.434 --> 02:29:16.194
or it's just mimicking the incline of the cliff,

02:29:16.194 --> 02:29:17.916
but you don't see anything behind it beyond just stone.

02:29:17.916 --> 02:29:19.124
SAM: Well, better trust your eyes.

02:29:19.124 --> 02:29:22.064
TALIESIN: Is it within touchy radius,

02:29:22.064 --> 02:29:23.694
or would I have to get up to it?

02:29:23.694 --> 02:29:27.634
ASHLEY: Leave it be.
MATT: I mean, there's rock,

02:29:27.634 --> 02:29:29.114
but when you get to where the water is,

02:29:29.114 --> 02:29:33.194
there's about 20 or so feet of the jet of water there.

02:29:33.194 --> 02:29:35.254
You couldn't reach through it.

02:29:35.254 --> 02:29:36.234
You could try.

02:29:36.234 --> 02:29:38.284
It's a very, very strong jet.

02:29:38.284 --> 02:29:39.964
TALIESIN: Yeah, even if I just tap it with my finger

02:29:39.964 --> 02:29:41.264
it probably wouldn't--
MATT: Tap the water?

02:29:41.264 --> 02:29:42.354
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:29:42.354 --> 02:29:43.187
MATT: Do you want to try?

02:29:43.187 --> 02:29:44.714
LAURA: Oh, your finger's going to come off.

02:29:44.714 --> 02:29:45.547
TALIESIN: No, I'm okay.

02:29:45.547 --> 02:29:46.654
LIAM: Those things they wash the sidewalk with.

02:29:46.654 --> 02:29:47.784
TALIESIN: No, okay, I thought I was like,

02:29:47.784 --> 02:29:49.874
maybe I could walk up onto the cliff or something,

02:29:49.874 --> 02:29:51.834
but no, I will not swim close to this thing.

02:29:51.834 --> 02:29:52.667
MATT: The cliff is pretty sheer.

02:29:52.667 --> 02:29:54.374
You could try and climb up it if you want to,

02:29:54.374 --> 02:29:57.474
but you're going to be meeting the water itself.

02:29:57.474 --> 02:29:59.915
TALIESIN: But that does look a little weird.

02:29:59.915 --> 02:30:01.048
MATT: A little bit.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:30:01.048 --> 02:30:02.662
MATT: It's up to you. Do you want
to try and climb the cliff?

02:30:02.662 --> 02:30:04.334
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to wait for a friend.

02:30:04.334 --> 02:30:05.167
MATT: Okay.

02:30:05.167 --> 02:30:08.424
You guys, who have dived down below into the water

02:30:08.424 --> 02:30:10.204
with your various light sources,

02:30:10.204 --> 02:30:13.664
you now see what it is that Beauregard saw the night before,

02:30:13.664 --> 02:30:15.274
though much easier at this point.

02:30:15.274 --> 02:30:19.994
You see that there is some silt and deep,

02:30:19.994 --> 02:30:22.704
dark dirt that is being kicked up

02:30:22.704 --> 02:30:25.804
right around where this little crack

02:30:25.804 --> 02:30:28.914
in the floor of this inlet is.

02:30:28.914 --> 02:30:31.944
And where it is, there's just massive pressure

02:30:31.944 --> 02:30:34.294
pushing the water up, and you can see it,

02:30:34.294 --> 02:30:38.204
it is causing the visuals in that space

02:30:38.204 --> 02:30:41.044
to stretch and shift,

02:30:41.044 --> 02:30:45.085
and it's a very unique and

02:30:45.085 --> 02:30:47.126
unexpected sight.

02:30:48.729 --> 02:30:49.854
And then once it hits the surface

02:30:49.854 --> 02:30:51.884
the water does bubble up a little bit around it

02:30:51.884 --> 02:30:52.717
from just the pressure,

02:30:52.717 --> 02:30:54.024
and it emerges and just goes straight up

02:30:54.024 --> 02:30:55.724
with sheer force beyond the surface.

02:30:55.724 --> 02:30:59.484
But from down below, you can just see that faint

02:30:59.484 --> 02:31:01.414
refracting of the vision

02:31:01.414 --> 02:31:04.144
beyond that fast-moving jet of water.

02:31:04.144 --> 02:31:06.534
TRAVIS: And it does look like a fissure in the rocks

02:31:06.534 --> 02:31:08.284
and not like some sort of plane tear,

02:31:08.284 --> 02:31:09.419
or something like that?

02:31:09.419 --> 02:31:10.424
MATT: From what you can see right now?

02:31:10.424 --> 02:31:12.704
Yeah, you can get closer if you want to.

02:31:12.704 --> 02:31:14.134
TRAVIS: I'll go closer.
MATT: Okay.

02:31:14.134 --> 02:31:16.414
MARISHA: I want to get to the bottom of the pool,

02:31:16.414 --> 02:31:17.984
feet on the ground.
TRAVIS: I want to touch it so bad.

02:31:17.984 --> 02:31:19.124
MATT: You guys get down to the bottom.

02:31:19.124 --> 02:31:22.156
It's about 50 feet down.

02:31:22.156 --> 02:31:24.504
You can find your feet scraping the bottom of the floor.

02:31:25.454 --> 02:31:27.264
You get in close to the rift,

02:31:27.264 --> 02:31:29.024
and as you're getting close

02:31:29.024 --> 02:31:31.744
you can sense the nearby water

02:31:31.744 --> 02:31:33.654
is starting to pull in

02:31:33.654 --> 02:31:36.124
because the water nearby is being carried

02:31:36.124 --> 02:31:38.784
with the thrust of this jet.

02:31:38.784 --> 02:31:41.036
I need you guys to each make a strength check--

02:31:41.036 --> 02:31:42.567
(laughter)

02:31:42.567 --> 02:31:44.804
to try and resist it.
SAM: To get pulled in?

02:31:44.804 --> 02:31:45.637
MATT: To avoid.

02:31:45.637 --> 02:31:47.214
SAM: Jesus Christ.
TRAVIS: Strength check?

02:31:47.214 --> 02:31:48.324
LIAM: To not get shot--
MATT: Yes, please.

02:31:48.324 --> 02:31:50.440
LIAM: -- 300 feet in the air.
MARISHA: Just a straight check

02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:51.690
or a saving throw?

02:31:51.690 --> 02:31:55.203
MATT: We'll say it's a strength saving throw.

02:31:55.203 --> 02:31:56.124
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: Man.

02:31:56.124 --> 02:31:57.374
ASHLEY: It's a strength saving throw?

02:31:57.374 --> 02:31:58.207
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Beau does not

02:31:58.207 --> 02:31:59.040
have high strength.
TRAVIS: 20.

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:00.898
MARISHA: I don't.
MATT: 20, nice.

02:32:00.898 --> 02:32:02.323
LIAM: High roll?

02:32:02.323 --> 02:32:04.006
MARISHA: 13 plus four, so 17.

02:32:04.006 --> 02:32:06.022
MATT: 17.
LIAM: Okay.

02:32:06.022 --> 02:32:06.984
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:32:06.984 --> 02:32:08.084
ASHLEY: Just making sure.
SAM: Don't worry,

02:32:08.084 --> 02:32:10.974
Yasha's super strong.
LIAM: Come on, beefcake.

02:32:10.974 --> 02:32:13.744
ASHLEY: 12.
(laughter)

02:32:13.744 --> 02:32:15.304
MARISHA: Shit.

02:32:15.304 --> 02:32:17.694
MATT: Both Beauregard and Fjord

02:32:17.694 --> 02:32:21.374
swim back, and you break against the force

02:32:21.374 --> 02:32:22.534
that is pulling you inward,

02:32:22.534 --> 02:32:24.474
and as you both like, (breathing heavily)

02:32:24.474 --> 02:32:25.544
you look at each other

02:32:25.544 --> 02:32:28.163
and then watch Yasha just go. (whooshes)

02:32:28.163 --> 02:32:30.979
(surprised laughter)

02:32:30.979 --> 02:32:32.535
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

02:32:32.535 --> 02:32:35.294
Oh! (bubbling)

02:32:35.294 --> 02:32:37.014
MARISHA: (bubbling) Yasha!

02:32:37.014 --> 02:32:40.689
MATT: So Veth, as you're slowly

02:32:40.689 --> 02:32:42.472
lifting up and levitating,

02:32:42.472 --> 02:32:45.054
it's beautiful, you hear the nearby birds

02:32:45.054 --> 02:32:46.224
are chirping on the edge

02:32:46.224 --> 02:32:47.204
of the jungles nearby--

02:32:47.204 --> 02:32:48.387
ASHLEY: This is how we're supposed to get

02:32:48.387 --> 02:32:49.370
to where we're supposed to go.

02:32:49.370 --> 02:32:51.565
MATT: And you just hear--
ASHLEY: I'll take on for the team.

02:32:51.565 --> 02:32:55.434
MATT: -- (yells) And you just watch Yasha tumbling

02:32:55.434 --> 02:32:57.394
ass over tea kettle in the middle of this

02:32:57.394 --> 02:32:59.924
extremely powerful upward waterfall

02:32:59.924 --> 02:33:03.924
as she is flung about

02:33:03.924 --> 02:33:05.432
180 feet in the air.

02:33:05.432 --> 02:33:07.654
The force throws her beyond the force of the water,

02:33:07.654 --> 02:33:09.244
the momentum and carrying you further,

02:33:09.244 --> 02:33:12.914
and you are now arcing beyond the water

02:33:12.914 --> 02:33:15.404
and are midair about to begin plummeting

02:33:15.404 --> 02:33:17.054
back towards the rocky cliff face.

02:33:17.054 --> 02:33:17.934
LAURA: Oh no.
ASHLEY: Oh!

02:33:17.934 --> 02:33:19.714
LIAM: Oh man.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:33:19.714 --> 02:33:23.294
SAM: By her trajectory, will she be passing me again

02:33:23.294 --> 02:33:24.781
on the way down, or--
MATT: Nope!

02:33:24.781 --> 02:33:26.214
TRAVIS: She's going to hit the lip.

02:33:26.214 --> 02:33:27.047
SAM: And how far?

02:33:27.047 --> 02:33:28.774
You said that she's 180 feet up.

02:33:28.774 --> 02:33:31.104
TRAVIS: But if the lip's 150 that's
really only a 30-foot fall.

02:33:31.104 --> 02:33:31.937
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:33:31.937 --> 02:33:32.770
yeah, yeah.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

02:33:32.770 --> 02:33:33.874
TRAVIS: It's not great.

02:33:33.874 --> 02:33:35.304
MATT: She's about 70 feet from you right now.

02:33:35.304 --> 02:33:36.954
LIAM: Somewhere under the water--
SAM: Just out of range.

02:33:36.954 --> 02:33:37.884
LIAM: -- Caleb turns to Jester and says:

02:33:37.884 --> 02:33:39.087
Look, I found a black one.

02:33:39.087 --> 02:33:42.054
(laughter)

02:33:43.071 --> 02:33:45.524
SAM: If she should get within 60 feet

02:33:45.524 --> 02:33:46.894
either on the way up or down--

02:33:46.894 --> 02:33:47.864
MARISHA: In the background, you don't even know.

02:33:47.864 --> 02:33:50.264
SAM: -- I could cast something, but--
MATT: She is--

02:33:50.264 --> 02:33:51.244
SAM: Not.
MATT: Not.

02:33:51.244 --> 02:33:54.004
She has passed you, at the rate at which she's going

02:33:54.004 --> 02:33:55.144
she is beyond--

02:33:55.144 --> 02:33:57.044
SAM: Oh well.
(laughter)

02:33:57.044 --> 02:33:59.727
MATT: Yasha, anything?
LIAM: Ah, she died for comedy.

02:33:59.727 --> 02:34:03.087
(laughter)

02:34:03.087 --> 02:34:05.088
ASHLEY: I turn into a goldfish.

02:34:05.088 --> 02:34:06.716
(laughter, clapping)

02:34:06.716 --> 02:34:07.549
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:09.273
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:34:11.724 --> 02:34:13.357
SAM: It's the opposite.

02:34:14.284 --> 02:34:17.444
TRAVIS: Barbarian, huh?
ASHLEY: I just don't know.

02:34:17.444 --> 02:34:20.534
I mean, oh dear.

02:34:20.534 --> 02:34:21.954
LIAM: You got them spectral wings.

02:34:21.954 --> 02:34:22.787
LAURA: Yeah, try 'em!

02:34:22.787 --> 02:34:23.620
ASHLEY: Yeah, I was going to try,

02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:25.614
but I don't know if I think they'll do anything,

02:34:25.614 --> 02:34:27.784
but I'm going to try it.
SAM: They'll look cool.

02:34:27.784 --> 02:34:28.617
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:34:28.617 --> 02:34:30.744
I'll bamf out my spectral wings.

02:34:30.744 --> 02:34:31.577
MATT: Okay.

02:34:31.577 --> 02:34:33.434
ASHLEY: I'll Necrotic Shroud, because--

02:34:33.434 --> 02:34:35.274
MATT: That's once a day, right?

02:34:35.274 --> 02:34:36.224
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

02:34:36.224 --> 02:34:39.254
So as you're in the air you, (groans)

02:34:39.254 --> 02:34:42.164
the air around you darkens immediately

02:34:42.164 --> 02:34:44.704
and the wings shoot out.

02:34:44.704 --> 02:34:47.324
They're like, you know, black, bony--

02:34:47.324 --> 02:34:49.374
ASHLEY: These aren't going to do it.

02:34:49.374 --> 02:34:52.420
MATT: Emerge with the tattered elements

02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:55.544
of what looks like black gossamer cloth

02:34:55.544 --> 02:34:57.614
on the edge that definitely correlates

02:34:57.614 --> 02:35:01.794
with the reveal of your fallen aasimar wings.

02:35:01.794 --> 02:35:03.674
Around the tips of the edges, though,

02:35:03.674 --> 02:35:07.654
you can see there are soft white plumes,

02:35:08.634 --> 02:35:11.834
a gradual transition.
ASHLEY: They're actually there.

02:35:11.834 --> 02:35:13.094
It's not just in the dream!

02:35:13.094 --> 02:35:15.054
MATT: There's a faint bit of white feather

02:35:15.054 --> 02:35:17.784
beginning to emerge from the tips.

02:35:17.784 --> 02:35:19.684
MARISHA: You're getting your pinfeathers.

02:35:19.684 --> 02:35:21.242
TRAVIS: They're all ripped off now, though.

02:35:21.242 --> 02:35:23.044
(laughter)

02:35:23.044 --> 02:35:25.011
TRAVIS: [inaudible] umbrella of fall.

02:35:25.011 --> 02:35:26.907
LAURA: No, no, no!

02:35:26.907 --> 02:35:28.204
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:35:28.204 --> 02:35:30.344
MATT: You flap them frantically.

02:35:31.624 --> 02:35:32.457
LIAM: ♪ Sail. ♪

02:35:32.457 --> 02:35:36.864
MATT: And what it does do, is it adds to the comedic effect

02:35:36.864 --> 02:35:39.531
of you impacting into the side of the cliff.

02:35:39.531 --> 02:35:40.847
ASHLEY: Perfect.

02:35:42.274 --> 02:35:44.119
Okay, okay, okay.

02:35:46.865 --> 02:35:48.944
TRAVIS: I love how you're trying to do something else.

02:35:48.944 --> 02:35:51.344
ASHLEY: Like I have anything.
(laughter)

02:35:51.344 --> 02:35:54.904
MATT: I'll say at this rate--
TRAVIS: Go into a rage.

02:35:54.904 --> 02:35:56.054
MATT: -- as you're thinking about this--

02:35:56.054 --> 02:35:57.014
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:35:57.014 --> 02:35:59.694
I was going to see, can I go into a rage

02:35:59.694 --> 02:36:04.504
even though I just did something?

02:36:04.504 --> 02:36:06.954
MATT: No, I'd say your action was the Necrotic Shroud.

02:36:06.954 --> 02:36:09.144
MATT: You're falling pretty fast.
ASHLEY: I'm falling, it's fine.

02:36:09.144 --> 02:36:09.977
I'll take it.

02:36:09.977 --> 02:36:12.404
MATT: So the wings come out, (whooshing)

02:36:12.404 --> 02:36:14.274
tumble over, and then crack!

02:36:14.274 --> 02:36:16.704
That blinding white flash in the back of your eyes

02:36:16.704 --> 02:36:17.664
as the pain sets in,

02:36:17.664 --> 02:36:20.024
as you, on your back and shoulders,

02:36:20.024 --> 02:36:23.544
impact with the wet cresting bit of volcanic rock

02:36:23.544 --> 02:36:25.444
that is pressing up from one of the pools,

02:36:25.444 --> 02:36:27.264
and it just hurts.

02:36:27.264 --> 02:36:32.264
You do take 12 points of bludgeoning damage, not terrible.

02:36:32.624 --> 02:36:34.992
I did roll pretty high for that.

02:36:34.992 --> 02:36:36.294
And it hurts.

02:36:36.294 --> 02:36:40.024
You're going to be stiff, but you're fine.

02:36:40.024 --> 02:36:42.074
You're soaking wet as the water's now

02:36:42.074 --> 02:36:45.301
just spraying on you, and you're like, (spitting)

02:36:45.301 --> 02:36:48.124
as you slowly sit up, and you are at the top of the cliff.

02:36:48.124 --> 02:36:51.554
As you sit up, you see Veth slowly rise up

02:36:51.554 --> 02:36:52.474
to meet your eyes.

02:36:52.474 --> 02:36:55.332
SAM: Whoa, that was crazy!

02:36:55.332 --> 02:36:57.882
(laughter)

02:36:57.882 --> 02:36:59.237
ASHLEY: I guess that's a way to--

02:37:00.164 --> 02:37:01.944
SAM: Whoa!

02:37:01.944 --> 02:37:03.394
You okay?

02:37:05.914 --> 02:37:08.564
ASHLEY: Sure.
(laughter)

02:37:09.403 --> 02:37:11.654
ASHLEY: It hurts, everything hurts,

02:37:11.654 --> 02:37:13.370
but it's going to be fine.

02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:14.599
I'm going to be fine.

02:37:14.599 --> 02:37:16.384
That was quite a ride.

02:37:16.384 --> 02:37:19.784
SAM: It was amazing; your wings looked magnificent.

02:37:19.784 --> 02:37:21.854
MATT: The wings are still out,
too, at this moment, by the way.

02:37:21.854 --> 02:37:22.828
SAM: Wow.

02:37:22.828 --> 02:37:23.884
MATT: And this is the moment you really get a moment

02:37:23.884 --> 02:37:28.104
to look and inspect the new shift.

02:37:28.104 --> 02:37:29.754
ASHLEY: Are you scared of me?

02:37:31.021 --> 02:37:32.664
SAM: Would you-- should I--?

02:37:32.664 --> 02:37:34.594
ASHLEY: How close to me are you?

02:37:34.594 --> 02:37:37.964
SAM: I'm probably 20 or 30 feet away.

02:37:37.964 --> 02:37:40.744
I can't move--
MATT: No, Veth was far away.

02:37:40.744 --> 02:37:42.044
The moment when the wings come out

02:37:42.044 --> 02:37:43.244
is when that effect takes place.

02:37:43.244 --> 02:37:44.837
ASHLEY: Got it. Okay, good.

02:37:44.837 --> 02:37:47.044
SAM: I mean, yes, you're very, ah!

02:37:47.044 --> 02:37:48.714
You're very scary!
ASHLEY: No, I didn't know.

02:37:48.714 --> 02:37:50.274
It's a good thing if you're not.

02:37:50.274 --> 02:37:51.264
SAM: Oh, oh, it's a good thing.

02:37:51.264 --> 02:37:52.869
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: No, I wasn't at all.

02:37:52.869 --> 02:37:55.791
(laughter)

02:37:55.791 --> 02:37:57.724
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab--

02:37:57.724 --> 02:38:01.257
just touch one of the feathers.

02:38:01.257 --> 02:38:03.060
MATT: It's very soft.

02:38:05.714 --> 02:38:06.547
ASHLEY: This is so weird.

02:38:06.547 --> 02:38:07.694
I had a dream about this,

02:38:07.694 --> 02:38:10.884
but I didn't think that it was actually real.

02:38:10.884 --> 02:38:12.594
SAM: Is this not something that happens

02:38:12.594 --> 02:38:15.281
with your people, or your--?

02:38:16.314 --> 02:38:18.464
ASHLEY: I don't know.

02:38:18.464 --> 02:38:20.674
I never thought that it would happen.

02:38:20.674 --> 02:38:24.763
SAM: Is it something that you...earn?

02:38:24.763 --> 02:38:26.694
Did you earn those?

02:38:27.864 --> 02:38:28.697
ASHLEY: Maybe.

02:38:30.202 --> 02:38:32.178
I don't know.

02:38:32.178 --> 02:38:33.774
I didn't know this could happen.

02:38:34.814 --> 02:38:36.494
SAM: I mean, it looks amazing.

02:38:36.494 --> 02:38:39.334
ASHLEY: I mean, there's just a couple, but I'll take it.

02:38:39.334 --> 02:38:40.167
SAM: Yeah.

02:38:40.167 --> 02:38:42.374
ASHLEY: It didn't help me fly, but--

02:38:42.374 --> 02:38:45.211
SAM: But maybe it will eventually,

02:38:46.473 --> 02:38:47.681
if you keep at it.

02:38:48.926 --> 02:38:50.584
ASHLEY: That's pretty cool.
SAM: Yeah.

02:38:50.584 --> 02:38:51.544
ASHLEY: Even though it hurts,

02:38:51.544 --> 02:38:54.019
I have a little bit of

02:38:55.027 --> 02:38:57.694
happy butterflies in my stomach.

02:38:59.306 --> 02:39:00.139
Okay.

02:39:01.064 --> 02:39:02.247
Well.

02:39:02.247 --> 02:39:03.505
SAM: I can't move.
ASHLEY: You're just floating.

02:39:03.505 --> 02:39:05.834
SAM: Yeah, no, I can't move forward or backward,

02:39:05.834 --> 02:39:07.634
I'm just floating here, so.

02:39:07.634 --> 02:39:08.467
ASHLEY: Well.

02:39:09.439 --> 02:39:10.839
I'm all the way up at the top now?

02:39:10.839 --> 02:39:12.024
MATT: You're at the very top of the cliff

02:39:12.024 --> 02:39:16.134
and about 20 feet away from the cliff edge

02:39:16.134 --> 02:39:17.374
based on the arc that you traveled.

02:39:17.374 --> 02:39:20.834
SAM: Do we see anything up there out of the ordinary?

02:39:20.834 --> 02:39:24.482
MATT: A lot of algae-covered pools.

02:39:26.564 --> 02:39:27.644
It would be algae-like,

02:39:27.644 --> 02:39:29.414
but this is not freshwater, this is saltwater,

02:39:29.414 --> 02:39:34.402
so it's a different saltwater plant life.

02:39:36.624 --> 02:39:38.804
Yeah, it's a lot of green-covered rocks

02:39:38.804 --> 02:39:40.552
and wet surfaces.

02:39:41.514 --> 02:39:44.577
Algae is saltwater, my brain isn't working.

02:39:44.577 --> 02:39:46.814
LAURA: It sounds pretty.
MATT: Yeah, it did, yeah.

02:39:46.814 --> 02:39:48.464
But there are all these different smaller

02:39:48.464 --> 02:39:50.194
elements where the water

02:39:50.194 --> 02:39:51.494
is captured into these pools

02:39:51.494 --> 02:39:53.644
and they're constantly being filled

02:39:53.644 --> 02:39:54.524
by this jet of water,

02:39:54.524 --> 02:39:56.974
so it's just pouring down into smaller waterfalls

02:39:56.974 --> 02:39:58.604
and cascading into tiny rivers

02:39:58.604 --> 02:40:03.274
that then spread down the side of the mountain in both ways.

02:40:03.274 --> 02:40:05.314
That's what you can look at right now.

02:40:05.314 --> 02:40:08.294
You do see a couple of stacks of stones in some places,

02:40:08.294 --> 02:40:09.127
deliberately placed.

02:40:09.127 --> 02:40:10.664
Some elements it looks like

02:40:10.664 --> 02:40:12.254
probably left here by the villagers of Vo,

02:40:12.254 --> 02:40:13.834
or other people who've come through here

02:40:13.834 --> 02:40:16.364
at some point in time.

02:40:16.364 --> 02:40:17.784
That does bring an element

02:40:17.784 --> 02:40:21.644
of intended construct to this space.

02:40:23.209 --> 02:40:24.514
ASHLEY: How am I supposed to get down?

02:40:24.514 --> 02:40:26.474
SAM: I've got a plan for that.
ASHLEY: You do? Okay.

02:40:26.474 --> 02:40:28.784
SAM: In fact, if you want you can jump

02:40:28.784 --> 02:40:32.674
and if we time it right, you can put out your wings

02:40:32.674 --> 02:40:37.294
and I can just have a sort of descend majestically.

02:40:37.294 --> 02:40:39.424
ASHLEY: I can't put them out again.

02:40:39.424 --> 02:40:41.984
It only is a once a day type of a thing, and I-

02:40:41.984 --> 02:40:43.374
SAM: Are they back in?

02:40:43.374 --> 02:40:45.074
Is that it?
MATT: They are now folding

02:40:45.074 --> 02:40:47.954
and then vanishing.
SAM: Oh wait, don't! No!

02:40:47.954 --> 02:40:49.412
ASHLEY: Yeah, they don't--

02:40:50.359 --> 02:40:52.334
And usually, I don't even know why I did it,

02:40:52.334 --> 02:40:55.704
because they're usually just floofy things, you know?

02:40:55.704 --> 02:40:58.382
SAM: I'm glad you did, you found the change.

02:40:59.624 --> 02:41:02.069
ASHLEY: I didn't know that was a possibility.

02:41:02.069 --> 02:41:05.324
SAM: You must be doing the right things.

02:41:05.324 --> 02:41:06.514
ASHLEY: I guess so.

02:41:06.514 --> 02:41:07.347
I hope so.

02:41:09.854 --> 02:41:11.844
Well--
SAM: But anyway--

02:41:11.844 --> 02:41:13.584
ASHLEY: Should we look?
SAM: I can float us down

02:41:13.584 --> 02:41:15.094
when we want to.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:41:15.094 --> 02:41:17.796
But maybe I should just do a look around.
SAM: Yeah, do a look-see.

02:41:17.796 --> 02:41:19.846
I'm just going to float here.

02:41:20.972 --> 02:41:22.040
ASHLEY: Going to look.

02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:23.114
MATT: Okay, so you guys are just inspecting

02:41:23.114 --> 02:41:24.224
the space around the area?
TRAVIS: How long can you float?

02:41:24.224 --> 02:41:25.234
MATT: Is there anything in particular

02:41:25.234 --> 02:41:26.114
you're looking for?
SAM: 10 minutes.

02:41:26.114 --> 02:41:27.254
LAURA: Oh, that's not very long.

02:41:27.254 --> 02:41:29.064
TRAVIS: You can't move forward or backward, though?

02:41:29.064 --> 02:41:31.484
SAM: Nope, up or down.
ASHLEY: Am I on a side

02:41:31.484 --> 02:41:34.270
of a little pool, or am I--?

02:41:35.984 --> 02:41:38.094
MATT: So you're on the edge of the base of the mountain

02:41:38.094 --> 02:41:41.822
and it is a very wide area.

02:41:44.233 --> 02:41:47.424
Imagine you're on an incline of a heavy rock slide trail

02:41:47.424 --> 02:41:48.404
that goes up the side of a mountain.

02:41:48.404 --> 02:41:50.736
So there's a lot to go on either end.

02:41:50.736 --> 02:41:52.514
A lot of it just slowly descends

02:41:52.514 --> 02:41:53.924
to the beaches around,

02:41:53.924 --> 02:41:55.594
but right in front of where you are

02:41:55.594 --> 02:41:56.794
it becomes a cliff face

02:41:56.794 --> 02:41:58.294
in that inlet right there

02:41:58.294 --> 02:41:59.904
where it drops off entirely.

02:41:59.904 --> 02:42:01.364
ASHLEY: There's a lot of--

02:42:01.364 --> 02:42:03.344
MATT: But around you there are dozens and dozens

02:42:03.344 --> 02:42:04.664
of smaller pools and areas

02:42:04.664 --> 02:42:07.024
where the porous volcanic rock itself

02:42:07.024 --> 02:42:09.774
has smaller and larger pockets

02:42:09.774 --> 02:42:11.424
where the water from the spray gathers

02:42:11.424 --> 02:42:12.674
and creates these different pools

02:42:12.674 --> 02:42:14.534
that lead and fill each other.

02:42:16.034 --> 02:42:17.217
It's beautiful.

02:42:18.624 --> 02:42:20.924
ASHLEY: I'll just look around at some of the pools

02:42:20.924 --> 02:42:23.074
to see if there's--
MATT: Okay.

02:42:23.074 --> 02:42:26.104
Make an investigation check for me.

02:42:26.104 --> 02:42:28.877
SAM: Be careful of snea snakes.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:42:30.874 --> 02:42:33.964
I hate this dice.
(laughter)

02:42:33.964 --> 02:42:35.214
ASHLEY: Seven.
MATT: Seven.

02:42:35.214 --> 02:42:36.144
ASHLEY: I'm going to put that one over there.

02:42:36.144 --> 02:42:37.794
MATT: Hard to make any specific details

02:42:37.794 --> 02:42:41.964
that catch your attention as abnormal in this area.

02:42:41.964 --> 02:42:42.964
It's pretty, though.

02:42:43.924 --> 02:42:44.757
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:42:48.044 --> 02:42:49.334
Well, I'll just keep looking around

02:42:49.334 --> 02:42:51.250
until I can figure out how to get down.
MATT: Okay.

02:42:51.250 --> 02:42:52.691
While you guys are doing that,

02:42:52.691 --> 02:42:54.181
you guys are beneath the water.

02:42:54.181 --> 02:42:56.163
TRAVIS: (bubbling) Where do you think she went?

02:42:56.163 --> 02:42:57.884
MARISHA: (bubbling) I don't know.

02:42:57.884 --> 02:42:59.074
She's fine.

02:42:59.074 --> 02:43:00.964
TRAVIS: Do I see anything with my See Invisibility

02:43:00.964 --> 02:43:05.024
around the rift, since we were temporarily closer?

02:43:05.024 --> 02:43:07.494
MATT: Now that you have light, and this time,

02:43:07.494 --> 02:43:08.844
you see the same thing you saw last night.

02:43:08.844 --> 02:43:09.824
You do notice, I'll say,

02:43:09.824 --> 02:43:11.494
as part of the See Invisibility,

02:43:11.494 --> 02:43:15.954
there is a faint aura, a flickering around the outside

02:43:15.954 --> 02:43:18.724
of this open rift where the rock itself is

02:43:18.724 --> 02:43:20.494
protruding a bit, and the dirt's being pulled up.

02:43:20.494 --> 02:43:24.564
There is a faint flickering of energy.

02:43:24.564 --> 02:43:27.024
It's invisible to most eyes.

02:43:27.024 --> 02:43:29.084
It's not like a spell incantation,

02:43:29.084 --> 02:43:31.416
but by nature of this rift,

02:43:31.416 --> 02:43:33.694
the lip of it is not visible,

02:43:33.694 --> 02:43:35.728
except for the spell that you have.

02:43:35.728 --> 02:43:37.074
TRAVIS: I can see something.

02:43:37.074 --> 02:43:39.434
It's definitely not normal.

02:43:41.109 --> 02:43:42.159
MARISHA: No shit.

02:43:43.819 --> 02:43:45.320
TRAVIS: Well, no need to be rude about it.

02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:46.997
(laughter)

02:43:46.997 --> 02:43:49.622
TRAVIS: Maybe we should check on Yasha.

02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:52.264
MARISHA: Two seconds.

02:43:52.264 --> 02:43:56.264
I want to check the floor to see if there's any, like,

02:43:58.234 --> 02:43:59.692
legs,

02:44:00.892 --> 02:44:02.542
armor bits,

02:44:04.504 --> 02:44:06.920
anything scattered on the floor.

02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:09.024
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.
LIAM: 20-year-old leg.

02:44:09.024 --> 02:44:12.474
MARISHA: 20-year-old, yeah, just skelly.

02:44:14.304 --> 02:44:16.484
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

02:44:16.484 --> 02:44:18.844
That's an 18 plus my investigation?

02:44:18.844 --> 02:44:20.154
MATT: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: 26.

02:44:20.154 --> 02:44:21.654
MATT: 26.

02:44:21.654 --> 02:44:23.829
You don't find any legs.

02:44:25.144 --> 02:44:30.144
Any corpses, anything, armor or objects necessarily.

02:44:30.764 --> 02:44:33.306
You do see what looks to be

02:44:36.944 --> 02:44:38.652
a piece of well-carved wood

02:44:38.652 --> 02:44:41.143
that is broken and long-soaked

02:44:41.143 --> 02:44:45.160
and left stuck under a rock there.

02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:49.524
It looks like a 2x4 that has been long broken

02:44:49.524 --> 02:44:52.334
and left to darken, and it's wedged.

02:44:52.334 --> 02:44:53.654
MARISHA: It's wedged?
MATT: Yeah.

02:44:53.654 --> 02:44:54.774
SAM: Oh.

02:44:54.774 --> 02:44:56.734
MARISHA: Can I try to yank it out?

02:44:57.744 --> 02:44:58.744
MATT: Yeah, it takes you a moment,

02:44:58.744 --> 02:45:01.334
but you manage to put a foot there and pull it free.

02:45:01.334 --> 02:45:02.467
MARISHA: Dope.

02:45:03.665 --> 02:45:05.014
TRAVIS: (bubbling) What'd you find?

02:45:06.477 --> 02:45:07.377
MARISHA: (bubbling) Wood.

02:45:08.757 --> 02:45:10.854
(laughter)

02:45:10.854 --> 02:45:12.084
MATT: Dope wood.
MARISHA: (bubbling) I don't know.

02:45:12.084 --> 02:45:14.134
TALIESIN: It would be so much easier to talk underwater

02:45:14.134 --> 02:45:15.659
if you guys weren't doing that.

02:45:15.659 --> 02:45:17.107
MARISHA: (bubbling) Let's go.

02:45:18.088 --> 02:45:20.267
TRAVIS: (bubbling) Okay.
(laughter)

02:45:20.267 --> 02:45:21.364
MARISHA: (bubbling) Are we okay?
MATT: Caduceus.

02:45:21.364 --> 02:45:22.197
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:45:22.197 --> 02:45:23.674
MATT: You were checking what thing?

02:45:23.674 --> 02:45:27.234
TALIESIN: I was just looking at that thing

02:45:27.234 --> 02:45:29.442
and then looking through at the bottom of the water

02:45:29.442 --> 02:45:30.574
to see if anything's clear.

02:45:30.574 --> 02:45:32.914
I also want to taste the water.

02:45:32.914 --> 02:45:35.564
Not the big spigot, but the water that's sitting--

02:45:35.564 --> 02:45:37.744
MATT: Okay, it is sea.
TALIESIN: It is saltwater.

02:45:37.744 --> 02:45:38.994
MATT: Saltwater briny, yeah.

02:45:38.994 --> 02:45:42.094
TALIESIN: Was the water in the cave briny as well?

02:45:42.094 --> 02:45:44.194
MATT: The water in the cave that you were in,

02:45:44.194 --> 02:45:46.364
in the mountain, you mean?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:45:46.364 --> 02:45:47.604
MATT: With Vokodo?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:45:47.604 --> 02:45:49.579
MATT: No, that was fresh.
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:45:51.264 --> 02:45:53.944
MATT: You make an investigation check for me.

02:45:53.944 --> 02:45:55.419
TALIESIN: Oh, that's funny.

02:45:59.024 --> 02:46:00.064
TALIESIN: 11.
MATT: 11.

02:46:00.064 --> 02:46:01.264
TALIESIN: 12.
MATT: Okay.

02:46:02.614 --> 02:46:04.774
Yeah, it's--

02:46:04.774 --> 02:46:06.214
MARISHA: You rolled a 12?

02:46:06.214 --> 02:46:07.564
TALIESIN: Other than that weird little thing

02:46:07.564 --> 02:46:10.054
that I don't even really know if it's really a thing.

02:46:10.054 --> 02:46:10.887
MATT: Yeah.

02:46:12.344 --> 02:46:13.177
TALIESIN: Damn.

02:46:15.064 --> 02:46:16.684
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just waiting for
them to come up at this point.

02:46:16.684 --> 02:46:17.551
MATT: Okay, you guys both again

02:46:17.551 --> 02:46:19.184
(splashing) break the surface,

02:46:19.184 --> 02:46:20.704
and you can see Caduceus looking up

02:46:20.704 --> 02:46:24.804
at the rock cliff face and the water spray.

02:46:24.804 --> 02:46:26.512
TRAVIS: Did you see Yasha go by?

02:46:26.512 --> 02:46:27.570
TALIESIN: What?

02:46:27.570 --> 02:46:29.704
TRAVIS: Yasha just went straight--

02:46:29.704 --> 02:46:31.396
Did she land? Did you see her?

02:46:31.396 --> 02:46:32.853
TALIESIN: Can she fly?

02:46:32.853 --> 02:46:33.814
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

02:46:35.164 --> 02:46:37.884
Start looking for Yasha.

02:46:37.884 --> 02:46:39.374
MARISHA: Yeah, Yasha!

02:46:39.374 --> 02:46:40.354
MATT: At this point you guys are,

02:46:40.354 --> 02:46:41.504
as you're looking around the space,

02:46:41.504 --> 02:46:43.637
you hear your voice being called.

02:46:45.024 --> 02:46:48.124
ASHLEY: Well, listen, if you just jump into it

02:46:48.124 --> 02:46:50.126
it'll take you to the top.

02:46:50.126 --> 02:46:51.074
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:46:51.074 --> 02:46:53.164
ASHLEY: So that's what happened to me.

02:46:53.164 --> 02:46:54.974
TRAVIS: That makes total sense.

02:46:54.974 --> 02:46:57.341
ASHLEY: Yeah, it just did--

02:46:58.314 --> 02:47:00.444
Beau could probably land well,

02:47:00.444 --> 02:47:03.404
but I didn't. I'm fine.

02:47:03.404 --> 02:47:05.044
TALIESIN: I was trying to check the back of this,

02:47:05.044 --> 02:47:07.794
but there is no back of it, so I don't really--

02:47:07.794 --> 02:47:08.627
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

02:47:08.627 --> 02:47:09.568
TALIESIN: I mean, look at it,.

02:47:09.568 --> 02:47:11.217
it's just sort of against the wall.

02:47:11.217 --> 02:47:14.124
I was like, maybe it's covering a picture,

02:47:14.124 --> 02:47:17.364
or a cave, but I can't really,

02:47:17.364 --> 02:47:18.664
I don't want to get into that.

02:47:18.664 --> 02:47:21.104
TRAVIS: I'll go back and look back as well.

02:47:21.104 --> 02:47:22.695
Anything with invisible eyes?

02:47:22.695 --> 02:47:23.553
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:47:23.553 --> 02:47:24.998
LAURA: Have I surfaced yet?

02:47:24.998 --> 02:47:27.354
MARISHA: Invisible eyes, invisible eyes.

02:47:27.354 --> 02:47:28.424
TRAVIS: 19. Ooh.

02:47:28.424 --> 02:47:29.534
MATT: 19.

02:47:29.534 --> 02:47:32.024
As you go over and look at the edge,

02:47:32.024 --> 02:47:33.304
the light as it's hitting the water

02:47:33.304 --> 02:47:34.694
and refracting the nearby rock,

02:47:34.694 --> 02:47:37.174
there's still that early morning light.

02:47:37.174 --> 02:47:40.706
There's something about the way the light hits this stone

02:47:40.706 --> 02:47:42.654
once it gets within 10 feet of the edge of the water

02:47:42.654 --> 02:47:44.044
that feels a little flat.

02:47:44.044 --> 02:47:47.354
There's something about it that's just off.

02:47:47.354 --> 02:47:48.845
TRAVIS: I see something.

02:47:48.845 --> 02:47:49.820
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:51.454
I've been trying to, like,

02:47:51.454 --> 02:47:52.934
there's something weird, but I don't know.

02:47:52.934 --> 02:47:55.094
SAM: I trust Caduceus.

02:47:55.094 --> 02:47:57.565
TRAVIS: We should check it out.

02:47:57.565 --> 02:47:59.744
Are you going to drag that thing with you the whole time?

02:47:59.744 --> 02:48:03.224
MARISHA: Caduceus, can you take this for me?

02:48:03.224 --> 02:48:04.826
TALIESIN: Hey, wood.
MARISHA: What is that?

02:48:04.826 --> 02:48:07.224
TALIESIN: That's wood.
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

02:48:07.224 --> 02:48:10.094
TALIESIN: Well, why'd you ask?
TRAVIS: What kind of wood?

02:48:10.094 --> 02:48:11.684
TALIESIN: Wet wood.

02:48:11.684 --> 02:48:13.274
TRAVIS: What?
MARISHA: What wood?

02:48:13.274 --> 02:48:14.934
LAURA: You guys, what? What about wood?

02:48:14.934 --> 02:48:16.464
TALIESIN: It's wet, it's wet wood.

02:48:16.464 --> 02:48:19.354
TRAVIS: Why did you grab the wood?
MARISHA: We found this wet wood.

02:48:19.354 --> 02:48:22.174
TALIESIN: Where?
(laughter)

02:48:22.174 --> 02:48:24.574
TALIESIN: Sorry, I promised I wouldn't do that anymore.

02:48:24.574 --> 02:48:26.053
MATT: The wet wood is well-worked.

02:48:26.053 --> 02:48:27.494
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Shit.

02:48:27.494 --> 02:48:30.084
So there's actually carving in this thing?

02:48:30.084 --> 02:48:30.917
MATT: It is.

02:48:30.917 --> 02:48:35.434
It has flat edges, it looks like it was part of a structure

02:48:35.434 --> 02:48:36.394
or something of some kind.

02:48:36.394 --> 02:48:38.884
It has four sides to it that are smooth,

02:48:38.884 --> 02:48:42.274
though it has over time grown

02:48:42.274 --> 02:48:45.694
bits of underwater vegetation and rotten places

02:48:45.694 --> 02:48:48.784
where the wood's darkened in a lot of different sections.

02:48:48.784 --> 02:48:50.964
TALIESIN: Does it look like a piece of a boat?

02:48:50.964 --> 02:48:53.414
MATT: Could be a boat, could be furniture.

02:48:53.414 --> 02:48:57.094
It's about that long, and it's jagged on each end.

02:48:57.094 --> 02:48:59.093
SAM: Oh my god, it's the chair.

02:48:59.093 --> 02:49:02.451
(laughter)

02:49:04.354 --> 02:49:06.234
TALIESIN: Clean it off a bit. It looks pretty--

02:49:06.234 --> 02:49:08.414
LAURA: You're going to clean the wood?
LIAM: Would you?

02:49:08.414 --> 02:49:09.314
TALIESIN: I'm going to clean the wood.

02:49:09.314 --> 02:49:12.144
I'm going to polish the wood, at least.

02:49:12.144 --> 02:49:13.624
I'm going to try and scrape it off a bit

02:49:13.624 --> 02:49:16.524
to see if it's possible to--

02:49:16.524 --> 02:49:19.244
Do you mind if I break the wood?

02:49:19.244 --> 02:49:20.874
MARISHA: It's not my wood.

02:49:20.874 --> 02:49:22.384
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and break the wood.

02:49:22.384 --> 02:49:23.550
MATT: Okay.

02:49:25.234 --> 02:49:27.344
It's going to be hard to do while
swimming in the middle of the water.

02:49:27.344 --> 02:49:28.177
TALIESIN: Oh, we're swimming.

02:49:28.177 --> 02:49:29.485
I wasn't, okay. Thought I was--

02:49:29.485 --> 02:49:31.384
MARISHA: Oh, I handed it off to him.

02:49:31.384 --> 02:49:33.014
MATT: Right, right.

02:49:33.014 --> 02:49:34.674
Are you guys leaving?
TALIESIN: Oh no, we're still there.

02:49:34.674 --> 02:49:36.634
I keep forgetting what the train is.

02:49:36.634 --> 02:49:38.094
TRAVIS: You guys keep playing with your wood,

02:49:38.094 --> 02:49:38.994
I'm going to go check out

02:49:38.994 --> 02:49:41.244
this rock surface over here that looked good.

02:49:41.244 --> 02:49:43.134
LAURA: Can I swim up next to Fjord?

02:49:43.134 --> 02:49:45.444
MATT: Sure, you've had no luck getting any pearls.

02:49:45.444 --> 02:49:46.277
TRAVIS: They're playing with their wood.

02:49:46.277 --> 02:49:47.381
MATT: You found two.

02:49:47.381 --> 02:49:49.254
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you Guidance before you go up.

02:49:49.254 --> 02:49:50.694
MATT: One worth 50 gold.

02:49:50.694 --> 02:49:52.694
One worth 150 gold.
SAM: Whoa!

02:49:52.694 --> 02:49:55.294
LIAM: That's the black one.
ASHLEY: My goodness.

02:49:55.294 --> 02:49:57.104
LAURA: What's going on?

02:49:58.693 --> 02:50:00.274
TRAVIS: Caduceus was looking behind the waterfall,

02:50:00.274 --> 02:50:01.944
but I still have See Invisibility up,

02:50:01.944 --> 02:50:03.644
and there's an area of the rock

02:50:03.644 --> 02:50:05.014
that looks strange.

02:50:05.014 --> 02:50:06.904
You want to look at it with me?

02:50:06.904 --> 02:50:07.774
LAURA: Sure.

02:50:07.774 --> 02:50:08.924
I'm going to cast Control Water.

02:50:08.924 --> 02:50:10.223
Where was it?

02:50:10.223 --> 02:50:11.056
TALIESIN: What?

02:50:11.056 --> 02:50:13.044
TRAVIS: Right behind the waterfall?
MATT: Yeah.

02:50:13.044 --> 02:50:13.877
TRAVIS: Right at the edge of the--

02:50:13.877 --> 02:50:17.052
MATT: Right at the edge and about 10 feet to each,

02:50:17.052 --> 02:50:19.704
or the side that you're on, 10 feet beyond that,

02:50:19.704 --> 02:50:21.979
the stone just felt weird.
TRAVIS: There.

02:50:21.979 --> 02:50:24.094
LAURA: I'm going to cast Control Water right below it

02:50:24.094 --> 02:50:27.664
and part the waterfall where it happens

02:50:27.664 --> 02:50:30.354
to where it goes around it.
MATT: Okay.

02:50:30.354 --> 02:50:31.524
You part the waterfall.

02:50:31.524 --> 02:50:32.644
As it sprays and goes up,

02:50:32.644 --> 02:50:36.274
it reveals the rock wall behind it.

02:50:36.274 --> 02:50:39.924
TRAVIS: I swim over and I'll reach out and touch it.

02:50:39.924 --> 02:50:41.254
MATT: Okay.

02:50:41.254 --> 02:50:43.394
Make a strength saving throw for me.

02:50:43.394 --> 02:50:45.404
MARISHA: Oh, to get by the--
LAURA: But I went--

02:50:45.404 --> 02:50:47.324
I'm pushing the--
MATT: You're pushing underneath,

02:50:47.324 --> 02:50:49.754
but it's still pulling the water up around it.

02:50:49.754 --> 02:50:51.904
The DC is much lower because you're doing this,

02:50:51.904 --> 02:50:54.364
but make it for me.
MARISHA: Come on.

02:50:54.364 --> 02:50:56.814
TRAVIS: Natural 20.
(cheering)

02:50:56.814 --> 02:50:57.734
ASHLEY: Nice.

02:50:57.734 --> 02:51:01.209
MATT: You guys watch as Fjord starts swimming through

02:51:01.209 --> 02:51:03.524
hearkening back to your entire upbringing

02:51:03.524 --> 02:51:07.664
of swimming in shores and just being a general water baby.

02:51:07.664 --> 02:51:11.594
Piercing through the center of
this divided upward waterfall,

02:51:11.594 --> 02:51:15.302
he collides with the stone and just goes right through it.

02:51:16.514 --> 02:51:17.887
TRAVIS: (yells)

02:51:17.887 --> 02:51:19.629
I don't know.

02:51:22.927 --> 02:51:24.074
MATT: I'm going to wait and see what you guys do.

02:51:24.074 --> 02:51:25.284
LAURA: Oh, god.

02:51:25.284 --> 02:51:26.894
MARISHA: Well, we got to go, right?

02:51:26.894 --> 02:51:28.114
We got to follow him.

02:51:28.114 --> 02:51:28.947
Fjord!

02:51:28.947 --> 02:51:30.134
Can you still hear us?

02:51:31.704 --> 02:51:33.204
MATT: You can still hear them, yeah.

02:51:33.204 --> 02:51:35.257
It's pitch black in there, there's no light.

02:51:36.232 --> 02:51:37.324
LAURA: Fjord!

02:51:37.324 --> 02:51:38.774
SAM: Fjord's gone.
LAURA: He went through.

02:51:38.774 --> 02:51:40.199
Fjord went through the mountain!

02:51:40.199 --> 02:51:42.184
MARISHA: How long can you hold this?
MATT: You can hear them.

02:51:42.184 --> 02:51:43.017
Just no.

02:51:43.017 --> 02:51:43.954
SAM: I can't hear what they're saying.

02:51:43.954 --> 02:51:45.074
ASHLEY: I can't hear what they're saying either.

02:51:45.074 --> 02:51:47.024
MARISHA: What?

02:51:47.024 --> 02:51:49.274
Fjord got sucked into the wall.

02:51:49.274 --> 02:51:51.592
LIAM: Look at this black pearl I found.

02:51:51.592 --> 02:51:52.734
LAURA: I can hold this for 10 minutes.

02:51:52.734 --> 02:51:54.234
You guys, Fjord is in the mountain.

02:51:54.234 --> 02:51:56.074
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to go, I'm going to go.

02:51:56.074 --> 02:51:57.514
SAM: I'm floating!

02:51:57.514 --> 02:51:58.347
MARISHA: I go in.

02:51:58.347 --> 02:52:01.784
TRAVIS: (deep voice) This is the mountain.

02:52:01.784 --> 02:52:03.384
MARISHA: Fuck you!

02:52:03.384 --> 02:52:05.674
TRAVIS: It's really dark in here.

02:52:05.674 --> 02:52:07.457
TALIESIN: Light up, I mean--

02:52:07.457 --> 02:52:08.432
TRAVIS: Oh, I have a sword.

02:52:08.432 --> 02:52:10.154
(pulses)
MATT: Okay.

02:52:10.154 --> 02:52:11.424
As the sword lights up,

02:52:11.424 --> 02:52:15.129
the interior of a cavern is revealed.

02:52:16.199 --> 02:52:20.761
It's about 45, 50 feet from side to side,

02:52:20.761 --> 02:52:23.589
and you can see that the cliff behind you,

02:52:24.594 --> 02:52:27.886
obviously a heavy portion of this is illusory.

02:52:27.886 --> 02:52:31.754
The waterfall itself is there for whatever reason,

02:52:31.754 --> 02:52:32.984
but it's utilized this part

02:52:32.984 --> 02:52:36.484
of the obfuscation process for this.

02:52:36.484 --> 02:52:39.544
But you are in a large cavern that widens up

02:52:40.444 --> 02:52:43.954
about 80 to 100 feet up,

02:52:43.954 --> 02:52:45.924
the cliff face that is above this

02:52:45.924 --> 02:52:49.014
is almost entirely hollow on the inside.

02:52:49.014 --> 02:52:51.264
And within here you can see water dripping

02:52:51.264 --> 02:52:53.464
in small streams of water.

02:52:53.464 --> 02:52:56.594
It looks like some of those pools above themselves,

02:52:56.594 --> 02:52:57.904
not all the water trails off,

02:52:57.904 --> 02:52:59.454
some of it actually falls inside,

02:52:59.454 --> 02:53:01.344
and there are about two dozen

02:53:01.344 --> 02:53:04.694
small little thin trails of waterfalls

02:53:04.694 --> 02:53:06.606
that are dripping from the ceiling.

02:53:07.644 --> 02:53:10.794
The water in front of you opens up

02:53:10.794 --> 02:53:15.791
into this gargantuan cavern hundreds of feet across,

02:53:15.791 --> 02:53:17.554
and with what little bit of light

02:53:17.554 --> 02:53:19.624
carries beyond the immediate vicinity,

02:53:19.624 --> 02:53:21.344
you can, from this moment,

02:53:21.344 --> 02:53:25.337
see about a dozen ships.

02:53:25.337 --> 02:53:26.404
SAM: (gasps)

02:53:26.404 --> 02:53:28.471
It's Goonies.

02:53:28.471 --> 02:53:30.004
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MARISHA: It's totally Goonies.

02:53:30.004 --> 02:53:31.724
ASHLEY: That is so cool.
MARISHA: "Down here is our time."

02:53:31.724 --> 02:53:35.384
TRAVIS: You all should get in here as quickly as you can.

02:53:35.384 --> 02:53:36.854
TALIESIN: Ah, all right.

02:53:36.854 --> 02:53:38.444
ASHLEY: What's happening down there?

02:53:38.444 --> 02:53:39.804
TALIESIN: We're going into a cave.

02:53:39.804 --> 02:53:42.344
MARISHA: There's a secret behind the waterfall.

02:53:42.344 --> 02:53:43.177
LIAM: DM.

02:53:43.177 --> 02:53:44.294
Where's this entrance

02:53:44.294 --> 02:53:45.704
that Jester made that Fjord went through?

02:53:45.704 --> 02:53:48.204
Where is it height-wise?

02:53:50.026 --> 02:53:52.694
MATT: Right where the water surface meets

02:53:52.694 --> 02:53:54.514
the jet has been now split,

02:53:54.514 --> 02:53:57.914
so there's an area where now there's two upward waterfalls,

02:53:57.914 --> 02:54:00.334
and there is an area that is just smooth water.

02:54:00.334 --> 02:54:02.024
LIAM: So basically-- okay.

02:54:02.024 --> 02:54:04.504
LAURA: But you have to make a strength check in order to--

02:54:04.504 --> 02:54:05.884
LIAM: I know I do.

02:54:05.884 --> 02:54:08.934
LAURA: Wait, Fjord, do you have any rope?

02:54:08.934 --> 02:54:09.767
TRAVIS: I do.

02:54:09.767 --> 02:54:11.984
LAURA: Throw it out so in case, you know,

02:54:11.984 --> 02:54:15.434
Caleb gets sucked into the waterfall.

02:54:15.434 --> 02:54:16.267
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:54:16.267 --> 02:54:18.664
LIAM: Caleb dives in and turns into a giant shark.

02:54:18.664 --> 02:54:19.497
MATT: Nice.

02:54:19.497 --> 02:54:21.346
TALIESIN: We could all use some help.

02:54:21.346 --> 02:54:24.024
TRAVIS: I have 50 feet of hempen rope.

02:54:24.024 --> 02:54:25.164
LAURA: Yeah, chuck it out.

02:54:25.164 --> 02:54:27.244
I'll catch it.

02:54:27.244 --> 02:54:28.574
Hold onto an end.

02:54:28.574 --> 02:54:32.257
MATT: The rope comes through, you catch it.

02:54:32.257 --> 02:54:34.321
You, as a great white shark,

02:54:38.164 --> 02:54:40.004
make a strength saving throw as a great white shark

02:54:40.004 --> 02:54:42.047
with advantage because you are big.

02:54:43.134 --> 02:54:45.774
TRAVIS: And a dope-ass shark.
MATT: And a dope-ass shark.

02:54:45.774 --> 02:54:46.804
LIAM: 21.

02:54:46.804 --> 02:54:49.284
MATT: Yeah, you push through.

02:54:49.284 --> 02:54:53.014
You are about as wide as the division is,

02:54:53.014 --> 02:54:54.174
so it's a little bit of a push,

02:54:54.174 --> 02:54:56.084
but you manage to come through on the side.

02:54:56.084 --> 02:54:57.384
As you're throwing the rope out there,

02:54:57.384 --> 02:54:58.604
you watch as a great white shark

02:54:58.604 --> 02:55:00.334
suddenly comes through.
TRAVIS: No, no, no!

02:55:00.334 --> 02:55:01.574
Eldritch Blast.
MATT: Okay.

02:55:01.574 --> 02:55:03.114
Roll attack on it.
(laughter)

02:55:03.114 --> 02:55:05.254
LAURA: Did you really?

02:55:05.254 --> 02:55:06.087
MATT: He doesn't know!

02:55:06.087 --> 02:55:07.104
Suddenly a great white shark

02:55:07.104 --> 02:55:09.126
comes through the cavern at him.

02:55:10.101 --> 02:55:10.946
TRAVIS: 13.

02:55:11.874 --> 02:55:13.284
MATT: Okay, 13 for the first hit.

02:55:13.284 --> 02:55:14.117
TRAVIS: 13 to hit, yeah.

02:55:14.117 --> 02:55:15.314
MATT: What's the AC for the great white?

02:55:15.314 --> 02:55:16.147
LIAM: 13.

02:55:16.147 --> 02:55:17.774
MATT: So yeah, the first one hits.

02:55:17.774 --> 02:55:20.514
TRAVIS: Oh, and a 19.
MATT: Okay, and the third one?

02:55:20.514 --> 02:55:21.804
TRAVIS: Oh, I do have three, don't I?

02:55:21.804 --> 02:55:22.864
MATT: Yeah.

02:55:22.864 --> 02:55:24.184
TRAVIS: Natural one.
MATT: Okay.

02:55:24.184 --> 02:55:27.544
So roll damage for two Eldritch Blasts

02:55:27.544 --> 02:55:29.194
against a great white shark.

02:55:30.514 --> 02:55:32.694
TALIESIN: This is literally a sharknado.

02:55:32.694 --> 02:55:36.809
LIAM: The white shark does have tiger shark stripes on it.

02:55:36.809 --> 02:55:38.594
TRAVIS: Oh, that's way worse.
LIAM: FYI.

02:55:38.594 --> 02:55:39.974
TRAVIS: 18 points of damage.

02:55:39.974 --> 02:55:41.304
MATT: 18 points of force damage.

02:55:41.304 --> 02:55:42.314
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:55:42.314 --> 02:55:44.214
LIAM: He seems okay.
LAURA: That's, like, all of Caleb's health.

02:55:44.214 --> 02:55:46.074
LIAM: Yeah, but not the shark.
TRAVIS: Tiger shark.

02:55:46.074 --> 02:55:48.771
MATT: The shark shrugs it off.
TRAVIS: Great tiger shark.

02:55:48.771 --> 02:55:49.657
Yeah.

02:55:51.212 --> 02:55:52.514
MATT: But does not seem to be coming right for you.

02:55:52.514 --> 02:55:54.184
TRAVIS: The water around me starts to warm.

02:55:54.184 --> 02:55:57.034
LIAM: I come right before.
(laughter)

02:55:58.234 --> 02:56:00.944
MATT: You pick that up immediately with your shark sense.

02:56:00.944 --> 02:56:02.054
Who else is going through?

02:56:02.054 --> 02:56:04.364
MARISHA: I'm right there, so I'll
try and grab on to that rope

02:56:04.364 --> 02:56:06.384
and start power swimming through.

02:56:06.384 --> 02:56:07.584
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Tap you for Resistance.

02:56:07.584 --> 02:56:08.844
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength saving throw.

02:56:08.844 --> 02:56:10.477
TRAVIS: Going to need a bigger boat.
MARISHA: Is that Bless, or Guidance?

02:56:10.477 --> 02:56:12.051
TALIESIN: That's saving.

02:56:12.051 --> 02:56:13.404
LIAM: (chomps)
TRAVIS: Like a doll's eye.

02:56:13.404 --> 02:56:15.164
SAM: We don't have a boat.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:56:16.194 --> 02:56:17.904
LAURA: Hold on to the rope, Beau.

02:56:17.904 --> 02:56:21.004
MARISHA: Holding on to the rope, I'm holding on--

02:56:21.004 --> 02:56:22.394
Uh-oh.
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

02:56:22.394 --> 02:56:23.824
MATT: Is Resistance a saving throw

02:56:23.824 --> 02:56:25.074
or it's an ability check?

02:56:26.274 --> 02:56:27.524
TALIESIN: 1d4 and add that number to roll,

02:56:27.524 --> 02:56:29.814
one saving throw of its--
LIAM: Are we repeating history?

02:56:29.814 --> 02:56:32.064
MARISHA: Well, I-- probably.

02:56:32.064 --> 02:56:36.544
I rolled a four on my d4 and a two on my d20.

02:56:36.544 --> 02:56:38.894
So that's 12.

02:56:38.894 --> 02:56:39.727
SAM: Hey, that's--

02:56:39.727 --> 02:56:42.314
MARISHA: No, 10.
SAM: Aww.

02:56:42.314 --> 02:56:44.314
MATT: Okay!

02:56:44.314 --> 02:56:46.544
So Beauregard starts pulling in on the rope.

02:56:46.544 --> 02:56:48.574
LIAM: Slow fall, girl.
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:56:48.574 --> 02:56:52.164
MATT: And gets side-pulled into it.
MARISHA: That's exactly what I'm going to do.

02:56:52.164 --> 02:56:56.144
MATT: Your rope goes extremely taut extremely fast,

02:56:56.144 --> 02:56:57.704
right after pissing yourself, what are you going to do?

02:56:57.704 --> 02:56:58.684
SAM: Rope burn.

02:56:58.684 --> 02:56:59.954
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm going to hold on to it, right?

02:56:59.954 --> 02:57:01.544
LAURA: I thought I was holding on to the other side, too?

02:57:01.544 --> 02:57:03.794
Me and Fjord were holding on to the ends and then--

02:57:03.794 --> 02:57:05.324
MARISHA: I was trying to rappel across.

02:57:05.324 --> 02:57:06.157
MATT: All right.

02:57:06.157 --> 02:57:07.904
Both of you guys make

02:57:07.904 --> 02:57:10.074
a strength saving throw for me, please.

02:57:10.074 --> 02:57:11.816
TRAVIS: Saving throw?
MATT: Yeah.

02:57:13.194 --> 02:57:14.794
TRAVIS: 14.

02:57:14.794 --> 02:57:16.434
LAURA: Oh, that was evil.

02:57:17.524 --> 02:57:19.004
TRAVIS: Come on, come on, guns.

02:57:19.004 --> 02:57:21.109
LAURA: Eight.
MATT: Eight, okay.

02:57:22.764 --> 02:57:25.934
So the rope--
(laughter)

02:57:25.934 --> 02:57:27.014
TRAVIS: Come on.

02:57:27.014 --> 02:57:29.643
MARISHA: No, no, come on.

02:57:29.643 --> 02:57:32.844
MATT: The rope, Fjord, suddenly goes, (whooshes)

02:57:32.844 --> 02:57:37.844
and then goes slack on your side back to your direction

02:57:37.904 --> 02:57:39.614
as it glides out of your fingers,

02:57:39.614 --> 02:57:41.254
and Beauregard, you.

02:57:41.254 --> 02:57:42.774
As you guys are getting ready off the edge of the cliff

02:57:42.774 --> 02:57:45.074
you watch Beauregard just, (screaming)

02:57:45.074 --> 02:57:46.734
up and through directly.
(laughter)

02:57:46.734 --> 02:57:48.954
ASHLEY: Can I try to, as she comes up--

02:57:48.954 --> 02:57:51.364
TRAVIS: I got her, I got her.
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

02:57:51.364 --> 02:57:53.794
Go ahead and--
SAM: Going to try to grab her?

02:57:53.794 --> 02:57:55.896
She's coming like a bullet.

02:57:55.896 --> 02:57:57.839
ASHLEY: Well, what else could we do right now?

02:57:57.839 --> 02:57:59.414
MATT: Make an athletics check.

02:57:59.414 --> 02:58:00.604
ASHLEY: Make an athletics check?
MATT: Yeah.

02:58:00.604 --> 02:58:01.854
LIAM: Catch yo' girl.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:58:03.404 --> 02:58:04.237
TRAVIS: Fair catch.

02:58:07.608 --> 02:58:09.854
LIAM: It's the biggest trust exercise ever.
ASHLEY: 19.

02:58:09.854 --> 02:58:10.784
MATT: 19.

02:58:10.784 --> 02:58:12.954
You reach out and grab her arm.

02:58:12.954 --> 02:58:16.314
The weight of it-- you pull her out,

02:58:16.314 --> 02:58:18.224
but the momentum still carries you back

02:58:18.224 --> 02:58:20.514
and you both, holding to this arm,

02:58:20.514 --> 02:58:22.774
do a flip.

02:58:22.774 --> 02:58:25.084
You do not take as much damage from the fall,

02:58:25.084 --> 02:58:26.914
but you both do take--
MARISHA: My shoulder.

02:58:26.914 --> 02:58:27.994
MATT: Two points of bludgeoning damage

02:58:27.994 --> 02:58:29.914
as you both smack on top of each other

02:58:29.914 --> 02:58:32.111
onto the rock right next to there,

02:58:32.111 --> 02:58:35.496
the wind knocked out of you from the impact.

02:58:35.496 --> 02:58:37.104
ASHLEY: (groaning)
TALIESIN: I hate all of this.

02:58:37.104 --> 02:58:39.064
ASHLEY: That one wasn't as bad.
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:58:39.064 --> 02:58:40.664
SAM: This is amazing.

02:58:40.664 --> 02:58:42.322
(laughter)

02:58:42.322 --> 02:58:43.384
LAURA: Hey, hurry up and get down here.

02:58:43.384 --> 02:58:45.944
I can only hold this for another eight minutes.

02:58:45.944 --> 02:58:48.014
MARISHA: Okay, hang on.

02:58:48.014 --> 02:58:50.274
LAURA: Are you okay?
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:58:50.274 --> 02:58:51.819
Yeah, yeah.

02:58:52.974 --> 02:58:56.029
Different approach, different approach,

02:58:57.658 --> 02:58:59.184
I'm going to go to the edge of the cliff.

02:58:59.184 --> 02:59:00.017
MATT: Okay.

02:59:01.164 --> 02:59:03.744
MARISHA: Can I see, how far down am I?

02:59:03.744 --> 02:59:05.144
TRAVIS: There might be a way up from up there.

02:59:05.144 --> 02:59:07.114
MATT: 150 feet.

02:59:07.114 --> 02:59:08.954
MARISHA: 150 feet?
MATT: Yeah.

02:59:08.954 --> 02:59:10.394
TRAVIS: Check the roof.

02:59:10.394 --> 02:59:12.144
MATT: Veth is still just--

02:59:12.144 --> 02:59:13.534
How long can you hold Levitation for?

02:59:13.534 --> 02:59:14.474
SAM: 10 minutes.

02:59:15.394 --> 02:59:16.744
MATT: You're about to run out on Levitation.

02:59:16.744 --> 02:59:18.224
SAM: Hey guys, why don't we go down?

02:59:18.224 --> 02:59:20.404
Just jump, I'll float us down.

02:59:20.404 --> 02:59:22.204
MARISHA: I got this.
SAM: Okay.

02:59:22.204 --> 02:59:25.153
MARISHA: Can you, like--

02:59:25.153 --> 02:59:27.172
TRAVIS: Famous last words.
MARISHA: Ah, shit.

02:59:27.172 --> 02:59:29.623
SAM: No, no, do what you're going to do.

02:59:29.623 --> 02:59:33.298
(laughter)

02:59:34.258 --> 02:59:36.653
TALIESIN: Literally famous last words.
TRAVIS: Only had years to learn.

02:59:36.653 --> 02:59:38.593
(laughter)

02:59:38.593 --> 02:59:39.743
Go on, girl.

02:59:39.743 --> 02:59:41.924
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, come on.

02:59:41.924 --> 02:59:44.077
TRAVIS: Let the spirit move you.

02:59:48.460 --> 02:59:51.144
MARISHA: Okay, can I see the door?

02:59:51.144 --> 02:59:53.536
If I look down, can I see the door?

02:59:53.536 --> 02:59:55.499
LAURA: It's invisible. It looks like a cliff.

02:59:55.499 --> 02:59:56.904
MATT: From this perspective?

02:59:56.904 --> 02:59:57.737
No.

02:59:58.917 --> 03:00:01.974
The arc, the water is spraying up past your guys' direction.

03:00:01.974 --> 03:00:03.414
You have to go around the side to look

03:00:03.414 --> 03:00:04.247
and it'll take you a bit,

03:00:04.247 --> 03:00:06.234
and you'll lose your Levitation by then.

03:00:07.362 --> 03:00:09.135
MARISHA: I'm going to jump.

03:00:09.135 --> 03:00:09.968
I'm going to jump.

03:00:09.968 --> 03:00:12.252
SAM: Do you want me to slow you down or not?

03:00:12.252 --> 03:00:13.574
MARISHA: Nah.

03:00:13.574 --> 03:00:15.099
I got slow fall.

03:00:15.099 --> 03:00:15.932
MATT: Beau's just "Nah,"

03:00:15.932 --> 03:00:17.671
and then just jumps off the edge of the cliff.

03:00:17.671 --> 03:00:19.524
SAM: Oh fuck.

03:00:19.524 --> 03:00:22.334
MARISHA: Okay, I want to, like--
TRAVIS: This is how it happens.

03:00:22.334 --> 03:00:24.193
MARISHA: -- do some dope monk shit,

03:00:24.193 --> 03:00:28.854
and I want to run and leap to get some momentum,

03:00:28.854 --> 03:00:33.073
but then do one of those gymnastics front flip,

03:00:33.073 --> 03:00:35.934
but 180 rotations?
TRAVIS: Pike, yeah.

03:00:35.934 --> 03:00:40.934
MARISHA: And yes, try and see if I can

03:00:41.234 --> 03:00:42.874
jettison myself through the door

03:00:42.874 --> 03:00:45.634
with my slow fall, kind of like--

03:00:45.634 --> 03:00:48.052
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MARISHA: You know, go into the hole.

03:00:48.052 --> 03:00:49.724
TRAVIS: Are you shitting me?
SAM: She's going to try it.

03:00:49.724 --> 03:00:50.694
MATT: Okay.

03:00:52.654 --> 03:00:53.494
Actually, from your perspective,

03:00:53.494 --> 03:00:54.327
you would be able to look down

03:00:54.327 --> 03:00:55.574
because the water doesn't reform into the thing,

03:00:55.574 --> 03:00:57.174
it would be two different jets that are going up

03:00:57.174 --> 03:00:58.554
from where you're dividing it.

03:00:58.554 --> 03:01:00.298
So you can look down and see that space in between.

03:01:00.298 --> 03:01:01.674
LAURA: (laughs) Looking up.

03:01:01.674 --> 03:01:02.507
Don't do it.

03:01:02.507 --> 03:01:03.624
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
LAURA: Don't do it.

03:01:03.624 --> 03:01:05.674
MATT: You say that just as you watch her.

03:01:05.674 --> 03:01:07.044
(whooshing)

03:01:07.044 --> 03:01:08.914
And so you leap, flip, turn,

03:01:08.914 --> 03:01:10.264
and then using your hand--

03:01:10.264 --> 03:01:13.401
MARISHA: I'm going to try and rappel down.

03:01:13.401 --> 03:01:14.284
MATT: Yeah, you're rappelling down

03:01:14.284 --> 03:01:16.374
using the hand to grab and slow things.

03:01:16.374 --> 03:01:19.224
You leap off a bit, you catch the edge of the water,

03:01:19.224 --> 03:01:21.874
and use your finger and that to thrust a bit,

03:01:21.874 --> 03:01:23.814
it burns your fingers for a second from the impact,

03:01:23.814 --> 03:01:25.134
but you do slow and rappel off,

03:01:25.134 --> 03:01:26.714
and you duck down the side,

03:01:26.714 --> 03:01:29.574
and you reach a point where you go for the wall

03:01:29.574 --> 03:01:31.454
and your hand just goes through.

03:01:31.454 --> 03:01:35.154
You hit the illusory portion of the cliff face,

03:01:35.154 --> 03:01:37.824
which means you would fall an additional 70 feet.

03:01:37.824 --> 03:01:39.384
LAURA: Oh!
MARISHA: Okay.

03:01:39.384 --> 03:01:43.174
I'm just going to try and start grasping through the wall

03:01:43.174 --> 03:01:45.254
at anything that might get me through this door.

03:01:45.254 --> 03:01:47.384
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Not 1,000 feet, so--

03:01:47.384 --> 03:01:48.652
MARISHA: No! No.

03:01:48.652 --> 03:01:50.184
MATT: So slow fall specifically--

03:01:50.184 --> 03:01:52.262
TRAVIS: That tone, "No."
MARISHA: No.

03:01:52.262 --> 03:01:53.744
It's not that high.

03:01:53.744 --> 03:01:56.074
It's like 800 less feet this time.

03:01:56.074 --> 03:01:57.674
MATT: Yeah. That makes a difference.

03:01:57.674 --> 03:01:59.523
LAURA: I love that you could've just taken Feather Fall,

03:01:59.523 --> 03:02:01.348
but no.

03:02:01.348 --> 03:02:02.394
MARISHA: I don't want to waste it.

03:02:02.394 --> 03:02:03.811
That's for him, right?

03:02:04.854 --> 03:02:06.767
LAURA: She's still going to use it on Yasha.
LIAM: She can do it with multiple people.

03:02:06.767 --> 03:02:08.728
LAURA: It would've been the same spell slot.

03:02:08.728 --> 03:02:09.654
MARISHA: I thought you could only do it on one.

03:02:09.654 --> 03:02:10.487
MATT: Five times, okay, good.

03:02:10.487 --> 03:02:13.378
ASHLEY: But this is pretty cool if it works.

03:02:13.378 --> 03:02:16.984
TRAVIS: It's like the highest belly flop competition ever.

03:02:16.984 --> 03:02:19.094
MATT: So the damage you would take--

03:02:20.304 --> 03:02:21.321
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

03:02:21.321 --> 03:02:24.194
LIAM: Can't wait to see the campaign three version of this.
LAURA: Oh god.

03:02:24.194 --> 03:02:27.264
Don't dash upon the rocks and be dead, please.

03:02:27.264 --> 03:02:28.874
LIAM: Slow Fall.

03:02:28.874 --> 03:02:30.504
TRAVIS: How many hit points you got?

03:02:30.504 --> 03:02:31.337
Oh.

03:02:31.337 --> 03:02:32.304
MARISHA: I'm good, Slow Fall.

03:02:32.304 --> 03:02:33.234
Slow Falling this whole time.

03:02:33.234 --> 03:02:35.214
MATT: 36 points of bludgeoning damage

03:02:35.214 --> 03:02:37.194
from impacting the surface.

03:02:37.194 --> 03:02:39.454
MARISHA: I negate all of it.
MATT: Yep.

03:02:39.454 --> 03:02:41.044
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: Whoa.

03:02:41.044 --> 03:02:43.492
MARISHA: I negate up to 60 points of fall damage.
MATT: Yep.

03:02:43.492 --> 03:02:47.311
MATT: So you just (soft splash).

03:02:47.311 --> 03:02:50.124
We're talking diver, Olympic-level perfect,

03:02:50.124 --> 03:02:51.964
almost no splash.
LAURA: That's so cool.

03:02:51.964 --> 03:02:53.074
MATT: Goes from flipping to landing,

03:02:53.074 --> 03:02:55.304
and then just straight down into the water.

03:02:55.304 --> 03:02:57.554
LIAM: Abe Sapien dive.
MATT: Yeah.

03:02:57.554 --> 03:02:58.387
Yeah.

03:02:58.387 --> 03:03:00.758
TRAVIS: How deep is the pool?
MATT: You don't know.

03:03:00.758 --> 03:03:02.421
SAM: ♪ How deep is the pool now ♪
MARISHA: Am I on the inside?

03:03:02.421 --> 03:03:03.831
TRAVIS: We went down to the bottom.

03:03:03.831 --> 03:03:05.497
MARISHA: I'm through it?
MATT: Yeah.

03:03:05.497 --> 03:03:06.330
MARISHA: Through the door?

03:03:06.330 --> 03:03:07.714
MATT: Well, on the outside it was 50.

03:03:07.714 --> 03:03:10.969
On the inside of this I'd say it's about...

03:03:10.969 --> 03:03:12.251
You don't hit the floor.

03:03:12.251 --> 03:03:13.474
MARISHA: I don't hit the floor.

03:03:13.474 --> 03:03:16.064
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're, like (crashing)

03:03:16.064 --> 03:03:17.314
on the bottom.
MATT: Ten foot deep.

03:03:17.314 --> 03:03:18.730
Just whack.

03:03:21.791 --> 03:03:24.054
SAM: Want to go down, Yashies?

03:03:24.054 --> 03:03:25.594
ASHLEY: Yeah, you ready?
SAM: Yep, you jump.

03:03:25.594 --> 03:03:27.194
ASHLEY: You sure you can--
SAM: I got this.

03:03:27.194 --> 03:03:28.324
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:03:28.324 --> 03:03:32.194
Run, take a leap.
SAM: Oh wait, I don't--!

03:03:32.194 --> 03:03:35.384
I throw a feather and cast Feather Fall on both of us.

03:03:35.384 --> 03:03:38.894
MATT: All right. Both of you guys gently drift down.

03:03:38.894 --> 03:03:40.264
You both look down and can see

03:03:40.264 --> 03:03:43.544
where Jester's currently spreading the waterfall,

03:03:43.544 --> 03:03:45.444
and you both can, if you want to,

03:03:45.444 --> 03:03:47.604
make your way trajectory towards that,

03:03:47.604 --> 03:03:49.744
pushing off and using that to get around.

03:03:50.874 --> 03:03:51.974
Eventually, you all can make your way

03:03:51.974 --> 03:03:54.314
into the interior cavern to meet up with Fjord.

03:03:55.774 --> 03:03:57.634
And with your Light spell as well

03:03:57.634 --> 03:03:59.594
and still be swimming inside,

03:04:00.654 --> 03:04:03.542
there are a dozen ships visible,

03:04:04.426 --> 03:04:07.004
parked and cluttered on the interior.

03:04:07.004 --> 03:04:09.084
And as you push in further and the light extends more

03:04:09.084 --> 03:04:11.034
there are more ships. There's probably

03:04:12.074 --> 03:04:14.094
in the neighborhood of about 20 or so ships in here.

03:04:14.094 --> 03:04:15.754
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.
MATT: Different sizes.

03:04:15.754 --> 03:04:18.054
Some are small speedy sailing vessels,

03:04:18.054 --> 03:04:19.004
some are trade vessels,

03:04:19.004 --> 03:04:22.124
there's one massive longship in there.

03:04:22.124 --> 03:04:23.484
TRAVIS: Do they look like they've been pushed together

03:04:23.484 --> 03:04:25.216
or docked in an organized fashion?

03:04:25.216 --> 03:04:26.784
LAURA: Or like they crashed in there?

03:04:26.784 --> 03:04:27.744
MATT: No, not crashed.

03:04:27.744 --> 03:04:31.119
They're all in very good,

03:04:31.119 --> 03:04:34.735
relative states of good condition

03:04:34.735 --> 03:04:36.534
from what you can see from this distance point.

03:04:36.534 --> 03:04:39.014
They're not organized meticulously,

03:04:39.014 --> 03:04:40.544
they're all just pushed in here.

03:04:40.544 --> 03:04:43.204
TRAVIS: And grounded up on areas of--

03:04:43.204 --> 03:04:44.154
MATT: From what you can see right now,

03:04:44.154 --> 03:04:46.664
they're just pushing against the edges of the water,

03:04:46.664 --> 03:04:48.034
and you can see some beyond that

03:04:48.034 --> 03:04:50.244
that are pushed up on a little bit of a surface.

03:04:50.244 --> 03:04:52.324
TALIESIN: Like a squirrel hoarding nuts, kind of?

03:04:52.324 --> 03:04:53.157
MATT: Kind of.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:04:53.157 --> 03:04:53.990
LIAM: Point of order.

03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.823
ASHLEY: I wonder if our ship is in here.

03:04:54.823 --> 03:04:56.152
Or no, kraken.

03:04:56.152 --> 03:04:58.724
LIAM: Giant sharks are dumb as rocks.

03:04:58.724 --> 03:05:01.154
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: So it's a very good chance

03:05:01.154 --> 03:05:04.024
that Caleb is aggressive territorial

03:05:04.024 --> 03:05:05.604
with all of the Nein coming in here,

03:05:05.604 --> 03:05:07.284
and if not that, he certainly doesn't know

03:05:07.284 --> 03:05:09.104
to turn himself back into a human

03:05:09.104 --> 03:05:10.844
before the end of the duration of the spell.

03:05:10.844 --> 03:05:13.511
LAURA: Oh my god, really?
LIAM: So you're going to have to deal with a shark.

03:05:13.511 --> 03:05:14.344
SAM: That how this works?

03:05:14.344 --> 03:05:16.644
LAURA: You would know to turn--
MATT: I would say

03:05:16.644 --> 03:05:21.074
you're still Caleb, you still have the intent

03:05:21.074 --> 03:05:22.604
of what you're trying to accomplish

03:05:22.604 --> 03:05:25.174
and know to end a spell.
LIAM: I remember a moth

03:05:25.174 --> 03:05:26.304
with an intelligence of one

03:05:26.304 --> 03:05:28.799
who could not finish her mission.
MATT: Right--

03:05:28.799 --> 03:05:29.862
LAURA: Well--
LIAM: Shark's got the same intelligence.

03:05:29.862 --> 03:05:33.291
LAURA: I at least knew I was Jester.

03:05:33.291 --> 03:05:36.054
MARISHA: (laughs)
LAURA: I was Jester moth.

03:05:36.054 --> 03:05:37.484
MATT: Right.

03:05:37.484 --> 03:05:38.504
There's a difference between not knowing,

03:05:38.504 --> 03:05:39.564
or saying you choose not to.

03:05:39.564 --> 03:05:41.484
So if you would like to--
LIAM: I'd like to eat Fjord,

03:05:41.484 --> 03:05:43.303
but I'll just let the moment play out.

03:05:43.303 --> 03:05:45.138
(laughter)
MATT: Okay.

03:05:45.138 --> 03:05:48.304
Yeah, there is a line there.

03:05:48.304 --> 03:05:51.302
I'll say with a shark intelligence of one,

03:05:53.464 --> 03:05:54.297
it's challenging for you

03:05:54.297 --> 03:05:56.224
to do anything complicated, of course,

03:05:56.224 --> 03:06:00.464
but you still recognize your friends as allies.

03:06:00.464 --> 03:06:02.434
Probably don't eat them.

03:06:02.434 --> 03:06:04.262
TALIESIN: Are you going to turn back, or what?

03:06:04.262 --> 03:06:06.467
LIAM: (chomps) Huh?

03:06:06.467 --> 03:06:08.717
TALIESIN: Are you going to turn back, or what?

03:06:08.717 --> 03:06:11.520
You can actually understand me; I can talk to animals.

03:06:11.520 --> 03:06:12.894
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:06:12.894 --> 03:06:14.205
MATT: You actually can understand him.

03:06:14.205 --> 03:06:16.824
LIAM: (grunts)
TALIESIN: Just, just--

03:06:16.824 --> 03:06:19.240
ASHLEY: Was that a growl?
TALIESIN: Come on. Get some legs.

03:06:19.240 --> 03:06:21.546
We need you with legs, the rest I don't care about,

03:06:21.546 --> 03:06:23.704
but we need legs.

03:06:23.704 --> 03:06:25.414
LIAM: Two early dinosaur legs go--

03:06:25.414 --> 03:06:26.837
MARISHA: Sharks sound like Bullock.

03:06:26.837 --> 03:06:28.364
LIAM: And then I finish out the whole thing.

03:06:28.364 --> 03:06:29.934
TALIESIN: That'll do.
(laughter)

03:06:29.934 --> 03:06:31.884
TRAVIS: Evolution.
(laughter)

03:06:31.884 --> 03:06:32.717
MATT: Perfect.

03:06:33.864 --> 03:06:34.697
All right.

03:06:34.697 --> 03:06:36.994
TALIESIN: One leg, 100 legs, just, you know?

03:06:36.994 --> 03:06:39.164
MATT: It looks like there are two smaller

03:06:39.164 --> 03:06:41.004
sandbank areas where some of the ships

03:06:41.004 --> 03:06:44.934
are pressed up upon, but most of this is just a deep

03:06:44.934 --> 03:06:47.014
subterranean lagoon

03:06:47.014 --> 03:06:48.730
where it's mostly open water.

03:06:48.730 --> 03:06:51.134
LAURA: We should be careful.

03:06:51.134 --> 03:06:54.304
Vokodo probably put all these ships here,

03:06:54.304 --> 03:06:56.474
which means he has access to this cavern.

03:06:56.474 --> 03:07:01.134
MATT: And with your passive investigation being insane,

03:07:02.005 --> 03:07:04.344
and looking at the different types of ships here

03:07:04.344 --> 03:07:06.857
and glancing at some of them being

03:07:07.754 --> 03:07:10.434
in not as good care, or at least a little more rotted,

03:07:10.434 --> 03:07:12.634
similar to the wood you found before,

03:07:12.634 --> 03:07:15.094
you gather that these were probably ships

03:07:15.094 --> 03:07:16.174
of the different people that came

03:07:16.174 --> 03:07:18.764
to this island and never left.

03:07:18.764 --> 03:07:19.597
SAM: Hmm.

03:07:21.334 --> 03:07:25.509
MARISHA: Hiding the evidence so they can't remember,

03:07:25.509 --> 03:07:26.700
or leave.

03:07:28.404 --> 03:07:30.064
TRAVIS: But that would mean someone would have to come out

03:07:30.064 --> 03:07:33.044
and get the ships, and if not him--

03:07:33.044 --> 03:07:33.877
MARISHA: Who?

03:07:35.054 --> 03:07:36.564
LAURA: Maybe he does.

03:07:36.564 --> 03:07:37.924
Maybe he comes out and gets them.

03:07:37.924 --> 03:07:41.214
SAM: Maybe dinosaurs bring them in here.

03:07:41.214 --> 03:07:44.064
TRAVIS: Well, we should certainly search some of these.

03:07:44.064 --> 03:07:47.714
SAM: Yeah, do they look like warships?

03:07:47.714 --> 03:07:49.426
LAURA: Or fancy ships?

03:07:50.314 --> 03:07:52.434
MATT: I mean, there's a multitude of kinds.

03:07:52.434 --> 03:07:53.700
A lot of them look like

03:07:53.700 --> 03:07:57.494
standard sailing ships, trade vessels.

03:07:57.494 --> 03:07:59.714
There are a couple of ships that are outfitted

03:07:59.714 --> 03:08:04.444
with cannonry and weapons.
SAM: Ooh, guns and ships.

03:08:04.444 --> 03:08:08.004
MATT: Yeah, there is one very, very large, long ship

03:08:08.004 --> 03:08:13.004
that is, I'd say, roughly a third of the size larger

03:08:13.084 --> 03:08:16.800
than the Balleater was. That is--

03:08:16.800 --> 03:08:19.004
TRAVIS: (like Lafayette in Hamilton)
And so the balance shifts.

03:08:19.004 --> 03:08:22.974
MATT: But they're all just pressed in here and left.

03:08:22.974 --> 03:08:25.474
TRAVIS: I mean, assuming this is some sort of

03:08:25.474 --> 03:08:27.104
different passage within the mountain,

03:08:27.104 --> 03:08:30.343
we could always use this as a bit of an ambush

03:08:30.343 --> 03:08:33.184
if we wanted to find the remaining cannons,

03:08:33.184 --> 03:08:34.734
any gunpowder that worked,

03:08:34.734 --> 03:08:36.812
and draw him out this way.

03:08:36.812 --> 03:08:38.452
TRAVIS: I have a...

03:08:38.452 --> 03:08:41.824
Do these ships look like they've been picked over?

03:08:41.824 --> 03:08:43.164
MATT: Vilya currently emerges

03:08:43.164 --> 03:08:44.684
from the water beneath behind you guys.

03:08:44.684 --> 03:08:46.111
TRAVIS: Oh, right.
MATT: "(gasping)"

03:08:46.111 --> 03:08:46.944
TALIESIN: Wondering.

03:08:49.808 --> 03:08:50.975
MATT: "What is this place?"

03:08:50.975 --> 03:08:53.574
TRAVIS: Did you ride the geyser out front, too?

03:08:53.574 --> 03:08:54.994
LAURA: No, she came through when I was holding.

03:08:54.994 --> 03:08:56.594
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:08:56.594 --> 03:08:57.914
MARISHA: It's real fun.

03:08:57.914 --> 03:09:01.594
TALIESIN: Have you ever seen a squirrel hide nuts?

03:09:01.594 --> 03:09:03.944
MATT: "I'm quite familiar with the behavior, yes."

03:09:03.944 --> 03:09:07.044
TALIESIN: I think these are just very big nuts.

03:09:07.044 --> 03:09:09.354
MATT: "Yeah, that's a way of putting it."

03:09:09.354 --> 03:09:12.812
TRAVIS: Do you recognize any of these vessels?

03:09:14.749 --> 03:09:15.614
MATT: "I mean, some of these vessels

03:09:15.614 --> 03:09:18.414
"definitely I have seen bring

03:09:18.414 --> 03:09:21.184
"individuals to the island before."

03:09:21.184 --> 03:09:23.794
TRAVIS: Any idea who, or what would move these

03:09:23.794 --> 03:09:25.484
back here besides Vokodo

03:09:25.484 --> 03:09:27.367
who never seems to leave?

03:09:28.974 --> 03:09:31.054
MATT: "If I recall correctly, the individuals,

03:09:31.054 --> 03:09:34.604
"once they had no reason to leave

03:09:34.604 --> 03:09:37.792
"they were told to bring their ships back here."

03:09:37.792 --> 03:09:39.125
LAURA: Oh.

03:09:39.125 --> 03:09:42.454
SAM: Is the entrance to the cave at water level?

03:09:42.454 --> 03:09:45.164
Could the ships be sailed into this?

03:09:45.164 --> 03:09:48.164
MATT: They could if the--
LAURA: Waterfall.

03:09:48.164 --> 03:09:53.164
MATT: -- if the waterfall was moved aside, or braved.

03:09:53.624 --> 03:09:56.233
That's as much as you can imagine.

03:09:56.233 --> 03:09:58.834
TALIESIN: Or stopped.
TRAVIS: We should see how deep this goes.

03:09:58.834 --> 03:10:01.659
LIAM: Did you say if any of them looked seaworthy?

03:10:02.494 --> 03:10:03.584
MATT: You'd have to get--

03:10:03.584 --> 03:10:04.624
At first glance you're like,

03:10:04.624 --> 03:10:05.804
some of these would probably be seaworthy,

03:10:05.804 --> 03:10:08.832
but you'd have to give it a full once over, yeah.

03:10:09.774 --> 03:10:13.634
TRAVIS: The most expensive looking ship, the grandest,

03:10:13.634 --> 03:10:16.314
we can spot it, yeah?
MATT: Yeah.

03:10:16.314 --> 03:10:17.994
TRAVIS: Anyone want to take a look inside?

03:10:17.994 --> 03:10:20.124
Or at least see how deep the cavern is

03:10:20.124 --> 03:10:21.534
before we just go fucking around?

03:10:21.534 --> 03:10:23.654
SAM: We should probably search that first,

03:10:23.654 --> 03:10:25.164
make sure that he's not going to pop out

03:10:25.164 --> 03:10:26.164
and surprise us, right?

03:10:26.164 --> 03:10:27.454
MARISHA: There's got to be another entrance

03:10:27.454 --> 03:10:28.794
into the mountain from here, right?

03:10:28.794 --> 03:10:31.877
SAM: Unless this is just a garage of some sort.

03:10:31.877 --> 03:10:34.124
LIAM: Why don't we just try to
get the lay of the place first,

03:10:34.124 --> 03:10:36.975
and then if we feel like poking about that ship.

03:10:36.975 --> 03:10:38.024
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:10:38.024 --> 03:10:40.474
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll start doing a
perimeter walk on one side.

03:10:40.474 --> 03:10:41.824
I'll take the left.

03:10:41.824 --> 03:10:43.434
MATT: This is a very, very large cavern

03:10:43.434 --> 03:10:44.267
to fit all these ships

03:10:44.267 --> 03:10:45.484
once you get to that point.

03:10:45.484 --> 03:10:47.724
And it goes further and further back than you'd expect

03:10:47.724 --> 03:10:52.724
to fit all these vessels, hundreds of feet.

03:10:53.194 --> 03:10:56.024
And you can see the sandbanks and such

03:10:56.024 --> 03:10:57.154
that are on the side,

03:10:57.154 --> 03:10:58.954
they have a heavy drop off

03:10:58.954 --> 03:11:00.704
into the center of the water there.

03:11:02.424 --> 03:11:04.894
TRAVIS: If you're going around on the surface of the water,

03:11:04.894 --> 03:11:07.554
I'll go under just to make sure there's nothing underneath

03:11:07.554 --> 03:11:09.204
as we're fanning out.

03:11:09.204 --> 03:11:10.944
MATT: Okay, yeah.

03:11:10.944 --> 03:11:13.774
As you dive below, and you guys are watching,

03:11:13.774 --> 03:11:15.604
you're moving between the different vessels,

03:11:15.604 --> 03:11:18.684
and you hear the creaks as some of the waves

03:11:18.684 --> 03:11:21.544
that are coming in from the exterior ocean hit,

03:11:21.544 --> 03:11:24.674
you can hear the gentle (creaking)

03:11:24.674 --> 03:11:26.074
and occasionally (banging)

03:11:26.074 --> 03:11:27.934
as they bang into each other

03:11:27.934 --> 03:11:29.484
from the shifting of the water.

03:11:30.504 --> 03:11:34.470
All the sails are tied up like they're--

03:11:34.470 --> 03:11:36.536
they've been put away

03:11:36.536 --> 03:11:39.654
by people who know how to anchor,

03:11:39.654 --> 03:11:43.402
or moor ships in the middle of a harbor, and just left.

03:11:44.456 --> 03:11:48.024
But you, make a perception check for me.

03:11:48.024 --> 03:11:49.644
TRAVIS: Balls, ass.

03:11:49.644 --> 03:11:52.824
ASHLEY: He had them bring them in here.

03:11:52.824 --> 03:11:54.474
TRAVIS: 18.
MARISHA: And they just forgot.

03:11:54.474 --> 03:11:55.634
MATT: 19? 18?
TRAVIS: 18.

03:11:55.634 --> 03:11:57.824
MATT: 18?

03:11:57.824 --> 03:12:00.054
Looking beneath the water,

03:12:00.054 --> 03:12:04.394
you see a faint orange glow on the opposite end

03:12:04.394 --> 03:12:07.714
of the deep, deep edge of the cavern

03:12:07.714 --> 03:12:10.224
on the furthest portion of it.

03:12:10.224 --> 03:12:12.504
TRAVIS: Distance, estimated?
MATT: From where you are right now

03:12:12.504 --> 03:12:13.924
as you're getting ahead of everyone

03:12:13.924 --> 03:12:15.004
since you have a swimming speed

03:12:15.004 --> 03:12:17.772
that is much faster than everybody else here,

03:12:19.204 --> 03:12:21.654
I'd say it's about 120 feet from you.

03:12:21.654 --> 03:12:24.304
You can see just the faintest element of an orange glow.

03:12:24.304 --> 03:12:27.184
TRAVIS: I'll pop up and just tell everyone what I see.

03:12:27.184 --> 03:12:30.214
Something down there, in case anyone wants to come along.

03:12:30.214 --> 03:12:33.374
TALIESIN: I'll feel better once I'm standing on even--

03:12:33.374 --> 03:12:34.864
LAURA: I wonder if that's--
TALIESIN: -- dry dock land.

03:12:34.864 --> 03:12:36.153
LAURA: -- that's the entrance?
LIAM: It's a back door for him.

03:12:36.153 --> 03:12:37.813
Yeah.
LAURA: (giggles)

03:12:37.813 --> 03:12:40.794
ASHLEY: Are there any of the names visible

03:12:40.794 --> 03:12:42.487
on any of the ships?

03:12:43.504 --> 03:12:46.584
MATT: You'd have to probably go around and check

03:12:46.584 --> 03:12:48.524
if you want to start picking them vessel by vessel.

03:12:48.524 --> 03:12:51.366
ASHLEY: Okay, well, maybe we'll do that in a bit.

03:12:53.234 --> 03:12:55.704
MARISHA: Does there seem to be
any other tunnels or entrances

03:12:55.704 --> 03:12:58.874
on this above water level?

03:12:58.874 --> 03:13:00.124
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:13:01.853 --> 03:13:03.753
MARISHA: Oh, I'm turning in [inaudible] now.

03:13:05.464 --> 03:13:07.344
Okay, okay, 20 total.

03:13:07.344 --> 03:13:09.167
Rolled a 16.
MATT: Okay.

03:13:10.159 --> 03:13:11.425
I mean, a lot of your vision is

03:13:11.425 --> 03:13:13.724
obfuscated by the vessels themselves,

03:13:13.724 --> 03:13:15.004
but from the areas that you're checking

03:13:15.004 --> 03:13:17.874
as you're swimming along and pushing between them,

03:13:17.874 --> 03:13:20.624
you don't make out any other tunnels

03:13:20.624 --> 03:13:22.874
that are visible above the water's surface

03:13:22.874 --> 03:13:26.844
or along the very edges where the sandbanks rise

03:13:26.844 --> 03:13:29.544
very temporarily above the surface of the water.

03:13:30.764 --> 03:13:33.104
MARISHA: And are there any,
as we're walking along the walls,

03:13:33.104 --> 03:13:34.894
are there any tool marks?

03:13:34.894 --> 03:13:38.014
Does this cave look like he just found it and got lucky,

03:13:38.014 --> 03:13:40.704
or is this carved out?

03:13:40.704 --> 03:13:43.024
MATT: From what you can gather,

03:13:43.024 --> 03:13:44.164
make an investigation check

03:13:44.164 --> 03:13:45.964
as you go along and swim to the edge

03:13:45.964 --> 03:13:48.954
of one of the walls on the side.

03:13:48.954 --> 03:13:50.314
MARISHA: Yikes, natural one.

03:13:51.604 --> 03:13:52.521
MATT: Hard to tell.

03:13:52.521 --> 03:13:53.854
You haven't had a lot of experience

03:13:53.854 --> 03:13:56.264
with the ins and outs of volcanic rock,

03:13:56.264 --> 03:14:01.033
both as a tooled material or as natural forming.

03:14:01.033 --> 03:14:05.204
It appears natural porous volcanic rock,

03:14:05.204 --> 03:14:08.094
best to your ability, but the cavern is very large

03:14:08.094 --> 03:14:10.794
and you're uncertain as to what process

03:14:10.794 --> 03:14:12.934
naturally would create such a large space.

03:14:12.934 --> 03:14:13.767
MARISHA: Okay.

03:14:14.714 --> 03:14:16.364
LAURA: Hey, Vilya.

03:14:16.364 --> 03:14:17.724
Is there a certain time of day

03:14:17.724 --> 03:14:21.505
you usually visit

03:14:21.505 --> 03:14:23.455
with Guacamole?

03:14:25.413 --> 03:14:26.534
MATT: "Not in particular.

03:14:26.534 --> 03:14:29.784
"Just about once every week or two

03:14:29.784 --> 03:14:31.904
"we'll bring what we've gathered or made

03:14:31.904 --> 03:14:33.964
"and I'll make a delivery."

03:14:33.964 --> 03:14:35.184
LAURA: Any time of day?

03:14:35.184 --> 03:14:36.634
Any time of day?

03:14:37.664 --> 03:14:41.874
MATT: "I mean, I generally keep it about early afternoon

03:14:41.874 --> 03:14:43.474
"to give me time to get back to the village

03:14:43.474 --> 03:14:45.914
"before it gets too dark."
LAURA: Makes sense.

03:14:45.914 --> 03:14:49.564
MATT: "I can fly quickly to and from when I'm by myself,

03:14:49.564 --> 03:14:52.234
"but even at night I wouldn't trust the airs

03:14:52.234 --> 03:14:55.434
"to just a solo creature like me."

03:14:55.434 --> 03:14:56.267
LAURA: Okay.

03:14:59.234 --> 03:15:01.374
SAM: Well, should we go further in

03:15:01.374 --> 03:15:04.914
to the orange glow and check it out?

03:15:04.914 --> 03:15:08.881
LAURA: I'm afraid that's going to take us into his--

03:15:09.854 --> 03:15:10.687
SAM: Oh.

03:15:10.687 --> 03:15:13.424
TALIESIN: The water that was in the cave was freshwater.

03:15:13.424 --> 03:15:15.494
TRAVIS: Let me go closer and see.

03:15:15.494 --> 03:15:18.124
I'll dive down and get closer to see what it is,

03:15:18.124 --> 03:15:20.870
if it's magma, doorway.
TALIESIN: It's not fed from here.

03:15:20.870 --> 03:15:22.424
MATT: Okay.

03:15:22.424 --> 03:15:26.644
You swim close, the murky depths of the water.

03:15:26.644 --> 03:15:28.634
And you can see now the bottom

03:15:28.634 --> 03:15:29.804
of the interior of the cavern,

03:15:29.804 --> 03:15:34.801
which is about 40 feet deep.

03:15:36.684 --> 03:15:39.704
So a little bit more shallow compared to the exterior,

03:15:39.704 --> 03:15:41.034
and it rises and falls in places,

03:15:41.034 --> 03:15:44.254
but as you get to the edge you look.

03:15:44.254 --> 03:15:47.514
The glow resembles the torch bloom,

03:15:47.514 --> 03:15:51.524
the faintly orange glowing plant-like

03:15:51.524 --> 03:15:55.259
seaweed flowers and such that currently,

03:15:55.259 --> 03:15:58.850
or last time you saw,

03:15:58.850 --> 03:16:01.975
guided you towards the lair of Vokodo.

03:16:01.975 --> 03:16:03.833
TRAVIS: I'll come back up.

03:16:03.833 --> 03:16:05.984
Caleb, where's Caleb?

03:16:05.984 --> 03:16:09.324
Do you have Frumpkin as a cat right now?

03:16:09.324 --> 03:16:12.324
LIAM: He's a bird, and if you want him to be able to swim

03:16:12.324 --> 03:16:14.699
I'd need over an hour.

03:16:17.104 --> 03:16:19.694
TRAVIS: It seems to be, I'll say
it's the same sort of growth

03:16:19.694 --> 03:16:20.664
that led toward his lair.

03:16:20.664 --> 03:16:22.904
LAURA: If we're going to go in and actually

03:16:22.904 --> 03:16:27.904
for real think about fighting today, yeah?

03:16:28.194 --> 03:16:29.364
Then--
TALIESIN: I don't think this is...

03:16:29.364 --> 03:16:31.564
I think this is something else.

03:16:31.564 --> 03:16:33.534
I don't think this is a path to him.

03:16:33.534 --> 03:16:34.674
TRAVIS: You don't think so?

03:16:34.674 --> 03:16:35.984
LAURA: But those are the torch blooms.

03:16:35.984 --> 03:16:38.064
That's what leads to him.

03:16:38.064 --> 03:16:40.226
MARISHA: But--
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something.

03:16:40.226 --> 03:16:42.394
I'm going to--
MARISHA: Maybe he just resides,

03:16:42.394 --> 03:16:47.394
maybe the volcano is just a little slice of the Fire Plane.

03:16:47.504 --> 03:16:51.314
And maybe this is spillage from the Fire Plane.

03:16:51.314 --> 03:16:53.574
TALIESIN: I'm going to dive, not dive,

03:16:53.574 --> 03:16:55.114
I'm going to do that thing where you exhale

03:16:55.114 --> 03:16:57.944
and allow yourself to sink down a little bit.

03:16:57.944 --> 03:17:00.934
I'm going to head to about 30 feet away,

03:17:00.934 --> 03:17:02.704
25 feet away from--
MATT: Okay.

03:17:02.704 --> 03:17:04.014
TRAVIS: You can breathe underwater.

03:17:04.014 --> 03:17:05.044
TALIESIN: Hmm?
TRAVIS: You can breathe underwater.

03:17:05.044 --> 03:17:07.364
TALIESIN: Oh, I know, I'm just--
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:17:07.364 --> 03:17:09.944
TALIESIN: -- gently paying attention to where I'm at.

03:17:09.944 --> 03:17:12.831
I'm going to cast Detect Magic.
MATT: Okay.

03:17:16.299 --> 03:17:18.214
You go ahead and cast Detect Magic.

03:17:18.214 --> 03:17:22.334
You don't sense the plants themselves are magic,

03:17:22.334 --> 03:17:24.616
but there's a faint magical aura

03:17:26.016 --> 03:17:29.461
in the water around you, and just in general.

03:17:31.154 --> 03:17:33.554
If you don't mind, Caduceus--

03:17:33.554 --> 03:17:34.874
SAM: Uh-oh.

03:17:34.874 --> 03:17:35.707
TALIESIN: Never.

03:17:35.707 --> 03:17:38.004
MATT: Could you go ahead and--

03:17:38.004 --> 03:17:40.004
TRAVIS: Swim up and rejoin his friends?
SAM: Roll a death save.

03:17:40.004 --> 03:17:42.320
(laughter)

03:17:44.194 --> 03:17:47.134
MATT: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me,

03:17:47.134 --> 03:17:49.101
if you don't mind.
ASHLEY: Uh-oh.

03:17:50.627 --> 03:17:51.994
LAURA: This is why we should've done the--

03:17:51.994 --> 03:17:54.266
TALIESIN: 13.
MATT: 13.

03:17:56.114 --> 03:18:00.422
You sense this, and you look at the torch bloom,

03:18:02.504 --> 03:18:04.844
and this urge overtakes you.
LAURA: Oh no.

03:18:04.844 --> 03:18:06.204
SAM: Oh no.

03:18:06.204 --> 03:18:08.337
MATT: This leads somewhere.

03:18:08.337 --> 03:18:11.444
This leads somewhere, and will answer all your questions.

03:18:11.444 --> 03:18:13.484
You have to know where this goes.

03:18:13.484 --> 03:18:15.101
You have to know.

03:18:16.394 --> 03:18:17.254
You have to know right now.

03:18:17.254 --> 03:18:18.304
So you swim towards it

03:18:18.304 --> 03:18:20.754
and you watch as the torch bloom opens up.

03:18:20.754 --> 03:18:22.334
TRAVIS: Where the fuck is he going?

03:18:22.334 --> 03:18:24.004
I go after him.

03:18:24.004 --> 03:18:25.864
MATT: You were watching him?
TRAVIS: No, I go after him.

03:18:25.864 --> 03:18:27.974
MATT: Right.
LAURA: You were watching him?

03:18:27.974 --> 03:18:29.124
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:18:29.124 --> 03:18:30.504
MATT: You go after him.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:18:30.504 --> 03:18:34.044
MATT: You watch as Caduceus just swims into a tunnel.

03:18:34.044 --> 03:18:36.814
TRAVIS: I can catch him, can't I?

03:18:36.814 --> 03:18:38.864
MATT: He's far enough away from you,

03:18:38.864 --> 03:18:41.004
I'll say that you can get there right about the time.

03:18:41.004 --> 03:18:42.414
Also make a wisdom saving throw for me.

03:18:42.414 --> 03:18:44.574
TRAVIS: Okay.
LAURA: Oh, god.

03:18:44.574 --> 03:18:47.454
SAM: Oh boy.
ASHLEY: Uh ohs.

03:18:47.454 --> 03:18:48.564
ASHLEY: This was like that--
TRAVIS: 20.

03:18:48.564 --> 03:18:50.554
17 plus three.
MATT: Okay.

03:18:50.554 --> 03:18:52.929
You resist the urge,

03:18:54.854 --> 03:18:56.674
but since you come up,

03:18:56.674 --> 03:18:58.834
he went off and did his own thing.

03:18:58.834 --> 03:19:01.214
You're probably keeping a little back to watch.

03:19:01.214 --> 03:19:04.076
You get to the entrance of this tunnel

03:19:05.064 --> 03:19:06.814
where he is partially in there.

03:19:06.814 --> 03:19:08.834
You can probably catch up to him if you want to.

03:19:10.324 --> 03:19:11.964
LIAM: Super fast.
TRAVIS: Yeah, I am faster.

03:19:11.964 --> 03:19:13.054
MATT: Yeah, you are faster with your armor.

03:19:13.054 --> 03:19:13.904
TALIESIN: Way fast.
TRAVIS: I'm going to try.

03:19:13.904 --> 03:19:15.724
I'm calling out to him through the water,

03:19:15.724 --> 03:19:17.314
but yeah, I'll try.
MATT: You hear it,

03:19:17.314 --> 03:19:18.674
but you'll get to that.

03:19:18.674 --> 03:19:19.924
You'll get to that. This is important.

03:19:19.924 --> 03:19:21.074
This is more important.

03:19:21.984 --> 03:19:23.794
He's not stopping.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:19:23.794 --> 03:19:25.501
I'm going to cast...

03:19:27.333 --> 03:19:30.254
(humming) Command.

03:19:30.254 --> 03:19:32.135
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Command!

03:19:32.135 --> 03:19:32.968
TRAVIS: At Caduceus

03:19:32.968 --> 03:19:35.186
and I'll say "Stop."

03:19:35.186 --> 03:19:36.914
MATT: And that's a wisdom saving throw?

03:19:36.914 --> 03:19:37.794
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:19:37.794 --> 03:19:38.804
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

03:19:38.804 --> 03:19:40.374
TALIESIN: This'll be the first one I make, isn't it?

03:19:40.374 --> 03:19:44.054
MARISHA: I know, that's what I was just thinking.

03:19:44.054 --> 03:19:45.004
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

03:19:45.004 --> 03:19:46.794
13?
TRAVIS: 17.

03:19:46.794 --> 03:19:49.775
MATT: 17.
TALIESIN: I'm rolling real bad today.

03:19:49.775 --> 03:19:52.300
(laughter)
MATT: You stop.

03:19:52.300 --> 03:19:55.514
And so, you used your action to do so,

03:19:55.514 --> 03:19:56.834
so you can catch up to him,

03:19:56.834 --> 03:19:58.894
but Caduceus has listened to you and stops

03:19:58.894 --> 03:20:00.644
and looks back for a second towards you.

03:20:00.644 --> 03:20:02.154
TRAVIS: What the fuck are you doing?

03:20:02.154 --> 03:20:04.169
TALIESIN: I got to go that way. It's very important.

03:20:04.169 --> 03:20:05.604
TRAVIS: I-- I--
MATT: He starts going again.

03:20:05.604 --> 03:20:06.437
TRAVIS: Stop.

03:20:06.437 --> 03:20:07.744
I just grab onto him, I hold him.

03:20:07.744 --> 03:20:09.414
Stop, wait, wait.

03:20:09.414 --> 03:20:11.384
Will someone come fucking help me?

03:20:11.384 --> 03:20:13.914
MATT: They can't hear you. You're far under water,

03:20:13.914 --> 03:20:15.224
and they're currently looking at the ships

03:20:15.224 --> 03:20:16.554
and inspecting the walls.
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

03:20:16.554 --> 03:20:18.229
SAM: This one's got <i>two</i> cannons.

03:20:18.229 --> 03:20:20.084
MATT: I need you guys--
(laughter)

03:20:20.084 --> 03:20:22.154
I need you guys to make contested strength checks

03:20:22.154 --> 03:20:24.294
to see if you can grapple and keep him at bay.

03:20:24.294 --> 03:20:26.169
TRAVIS: You big-ass firbolg.

03:20:29.764 --> 03:20:31.513
12.
TALIESIN: Seven.

03:20:31.513 --> 03:20:32.563
(cheering)

03:20:32.563 --> 03:20:35.174
TALIESIN: I'm not very strong.
TRAVIS: Oh, me neither.

03:20:35.174 --> 03:20:38.789
MATT: So you have him--
(laughter)

03:20:38.789 --> 03:20:40.554
(groaning)

03:20:40.554 --> 03:20:41.644
You have him currently held,

03:20:41.644 --> 03:20:42.864
and thankfully the torch bloom

03:20:42.864 --> 03:20:43.934
is not close enough to the point--

03:20:43.934 --> 03:20:46.624
like, the water is warm here,

03:20:46.624 --> 03:20:49.444
and right now you can sense something,

03:20:49.444 --> 03:20:51.504
while you're holding him,

03:20:51.504 --> 03:20:52.754
while you can breathe underwater,

03:20:52.754 --> 03:20:53.704
you can breathe the water,

03:20:53.704 --> 03:20:56.934
the water itself seems to shift from salty to fresh

03:20:56.934 --> 03:20:59.962
as you guys are struggling.

03:20:59.962 --> 03:21:02.004
MARISHA: It is a pathway, then.
TRAVIS: Do I--

03:21:02.004 --> 03:21:03.564
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah, man.

03:21:03.564 --> 03:21:04.397
ASHLEY: Magic.

03:21:04.397 --> 03:21:05.804
LAURA: Yeah, it was going to lead him

03:21:05.804 --> 03:21:08.974
straight to the--
TRAVIS: Can I take an action?

03:21:08.974 --> 03:21:10.084
MATT: Yes, you can.
MARISHA: Fuck.

03:21:10.084 --> 03:21:10.917
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:21:10.917 --> 03:21:13.114
I'm going to cast, fuck it,

03:21:13.114 --> 03:21:14.124
we've got to get the fuck out of here.

03:21:14.124 --> 03:21:15.684
MATT: Well, actually before you may take an action,

03:21:15.684 --> 03:21:19.137
Caduceus, he's holding you back.

03:21:19.137 --> 03:21:20.184
He doesn't understand.

03:21:20.184 --> 03:21:22.164
You know he means well, he means well.

03:21:22.164 --> 03:21:24.784
SAM: Kill him.
(laughter)

03:21:24.784 --> 03:21:26.574
MATT: But you're going to probably try and break free.

03:21:26.574 --> 03:21:29.504
TALIESIN: Yeah, what have I got?
SAM: Blindness!

03:21:29.504 --> 03:21:30.404
TRAVIS: I remember this.

03:21:30.404 --> 03:21:32.224
I remember this urge from before.

03:21:32.224 --> 03:21:34.091
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is a rough one.

03:21:36.404 --> 03:21:38.964
ASHLEY: Wait, who are the--
TALIESIN: That might work.

03:21:38.964 --> 03:21:40.734
ASHLEY: In the last tunnels, who was the one?

03:21:40.734 --> 03:21:41.567
Me and--
LAURA: Me.

03:21:41.567 --> 03:21:42.784
ASHLEY: You and me.

03:21:42.784 --> 03:21:43.617
We swam.

03:21:43.617 --> 03:21:44.544
TRAVIS: Yeah, we were--
ASHLEY: There were a bunch

03:21:44.544 --> 03:21:45.377
of different tunnels.
LAURA: No, but not you.

03:21:45.377 --> 03:21:46.264
We swam past you.

03:21:46.264 --> 03:21:47.924
ASHLEY: So this is one of them.

03:21:47.924 --> 03:21:49.964
TRAVIS: I was going to.
LAURA: Uh-uh.

03:21:49.964 --> 03:21:52.374
You succeeded.
TALIESIN: What do I got?

03:21:52.374 --> 03:21:53.294
Yeah.
LAURA: It was Nott.

03:21:53.294 --> 03:21:55.254
TALIESIN: I'm not going to hurt him or anything,

03:21:55.254 --> 03:21:57.274
but let's--
ASHLEY: Three of us.

03:21:57.274 --> 03:21:59.064
LIAM: Not too bad.

03:21:59.064 --> 03:22:00.064
TALIESIN: Do I need a...

03:22:00.064 --> 03:22:01.874
I can do everything, I've got verbal,

03:22:01.874 --> 03:22:04.354
I've got everything I need, right?

03:22:04.354 --> 03:22:05.604
For casting a spell?
MATT: Yeah.

03:22:05.604 --> 03:22:07.520
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Blindness.

03:22:07.520 --> 03:22:08.353
SAM: Oh.

03:22:09.384 --> 03:22:10.454
TALIESIN: And then try to break free.
MATT: What's the saving throw on that?

03:22:10.454 --> 03:22:11.414
SAM: That's a good one.

03:22:11.414 --> 03:22:13.774
TALIESIN: That's a constitution 17.

03:22:13.774 --> 03:22:14.879
MATT: Go make a constitution saving throw for me.

03:22:14.879 --> 03:22:18.610
TRAVIS: I'll Counterspell it.
(laughter)

03:22:18.610 --> 03:22:20.426
SAM: We're wasting all of our spells.

03:22:20.426 --> 03:22:21.704
ASHLEY: All the spells.
MATT: Here's my question.

03:22:21.704 --> 03:22:25.704
Counterspell, does it have somatic components?

03:22:25.704 --> 03:22:28.786
Because you are currently holding Caduceus.

03:22:29.791 --> 03:22:31.344
TRAVIS: It does say S.

03:22:31.344 --> 03:22:32.224
MATT: Yeah, so you would not be able

03:22:32.224 --> 03:22:33.810
to Counterspell while you're grappling him.

03:22:33.810 --> 03:22:34.804
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:22:34.804 --> 03:22:36.734
MATT: If you want to let go and counter the spell,

03:22:36.734 --> 03:22:38.204
or keep holding and go blind,

03:22:38.204 --> 03:22:39.984
or attempt to make the save at least.

03:22:39.984 --> 03:22:41.574
Your call.

03:22:41.574 --> 03:22:44.604
LIAM: In five, four, three--
TRAVIS: What are the components?

03:22:44.604 --> 03:22:46.507
MATT: Verbal, somatic, and material.

03:22:46.507 --> 03:22:48.002
TRAVIS: Right, and somatic means?
SAM: Moving.

03:22:48.002 --> 03:22:49.401
MATT: Means you need to be able to move your hands

03:22:49.401 --> 03:22:50.234
and fingers to cast a spell.

03:22:50.234 --> 03:22:51.144
TALIESIN: It's a hand thing.
LIAM: That's all it is

03:22:51.144 --> 03:22:52.224
for a Counterspell.
TRAVIS: I'll let go of him.

03:22:52.224 --> 03:22:54.404
MATT: Okay, so you let go and counter the spell.

03:22:54.404 --> 03:22:55.494
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:22:55.494 --> 03:22:56.794
MATT: So the spell does nothing,

03:22:56.794 --> 03:22:58.754
but you are free of Fjord--
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to head my way.

03:22:58.754 --> 03:23:00.084
MATT: And so, you continue swimming.

03:23:00.084 --> 03:23:01.184
So he's still trying to get away from you.

03:23:01.184 --> 03:23:02.774
TRAVIS: I'm going to catch his bitch-ass again.

03:23:02.774 --> 03:23:04.844
MATT: Okay, make another contesting strength check.

03:23:04.844 --> 03:23:07.214
You can keep up with him.

03:23:07.214 --> 03:23:08.244
Yeah, you can--

03:23:08.244 --> 03:23:09.814
LAURA: And none of us know of any of this.

03:23:09.814 --> 03:23:11.284
MATT: At the moment, no.
ASHLEY: Do we notice at some point

03:23:11.284 --> 03:23:12.117
that they're missing?

03:23:12.117 --> 03:23:13.564
Or we think--
MATT: You will eventually.

03:23:13.564 --> 03:23:14.397
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:23:14.397 --> 03:23:15.834
MATT: But this is all happening very quickly.

03:23:15.834 --> 03:23:16.994
LIAM: All right, Frumpkin,

03:23:16.994 --> 03:23:18.614
we are going to make you into an octopus.

03:23:18.614 --> 03:23:19.859
TRAVIS: 14?
TALIESIN: Seven.

03:23:19.859 --> 03:23:21.024
(laughter)

03:23:21.024 --> 03:23:22.954
MATT: You grab him again.
TRAVIS: Why are you doing this?

03:23:22.954 --> 03:23:25.214
This is ridiculous!
TALIESIN: I've got to go there.

03:23:25.214 --> 03:23:27.074
TRAVIS: Nothing but danger lies ahead.

03:23:27.074 --> 03:23:30.083
Stop fighting me!
TALIESIN: I've got to go there.

03:23:32.534 --> 03:23:35.348
SAM: Burn a couple more spells.
TRAVIS: I'm going to.

03:23:35.348 --> 03:23:36.830
ASHLEY: Don't.
TRAVIS: I'm going to.

03:23:36.830 --> 03:23:38.024
LAURA: Can you pull him back?

03:23:38.024 --> 03:23:39.882
Can you just try to pull him back?

03:23:39.882 --> 03:23:42.349
TRAVIS: I think I'm just able to stop him, right?

03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:44.904
ASHLEY: Tie him up, or something.
MATT: I mean, you can use half your movement

03:23:44.904 --> 03:23:46.124
and drag him back, I'd say,

03:23:46.124 --> 03:23:47.284
which for you is a full movement

03:23:47.284 --> 03:23:48.484
because of the water, so--

03:23:48.484 --> 03:23:50.424
TRAVIS: How far into this tunnel are we?

03:23:50.424 --> 03:23:53.494
MATT: You're probably no more than 15 feet, maybe.

03:23:53.494 --> 03:23:55.384
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I'd love to do that.

03:23:55.384 --> 03:23:56.414
I'll try and--

03:23:56.414 --> 03:23:58.174
MATT: Yeah-- or you'd be about 30 feet at this point

03:23:58.174 --> 03:23:59.007
because you went in after him

03:23:59.007 --> 03:24:01.124
and you moved your double speed to get there,

03:24:01.124 --> 03:24:03.291
which would've been 15 and 15.
TALIESIN: Well, I had to use the action

03:24:03.291 --> 03:24:04.914
to cast the spell.

03:24:04.914 --> 03:24:06.344
MATT: Correct, that was the round after that,

03:24:06.344 --> 03:24:07.177
so you'd be 30 feet.

03:24:07.177 --> 03:24:09.124
So you can pull him back to the entrance

03:24:10.044 --> 03:24:11.554
with a double move.

03:24:11.554 --> 03:24:15.594
And then you now take your turn to try and...

03:24:15.594 --> 03:24:18.894
TALIESIN: Let's try some little more...

03:24:18.894 --> 03:24:22.514
Okay, I can't do that.

03:24:24.271 --> 03:24:26.071
No, that's not good.

03:24:27.105 --> 03:24:27.938
MATT: It's not so much to hurt him.

03:24:27.938 --> 03:24:28.914
He just-- he doesn't understand,

03:24:28.914 --> 03:24:30.622
and this is very important.
TALIESIN: I know, I'm trying not to hurt him,

03:24:30.622 --> 03:24:32.783
I'm trying to be nice.

03:24:32.783 --> 03:24:34.264
MARISHA: (breathy laughter)

03:24:34.264 --> 03:24:35.605
TALIESIN: Let's...

03:24:36.994 --> 03:24:38.444
Fuck it, it worked last time.

03:24:39.286 --> 03:24:41.774
(snaps) Blindness again.
(laughter)

03:24:41.774 --> 03:24:44.774
TALIESIN: Fuck off.
(laughter)

03:24:46.284 --> 03:24:47.574
LIAM: No Contagion?

03:24:47.574 --> 03:24:48.684
TRAVIS: That's--
TALIESIN: I mean--

03:24:48.684 --> 03:24:50.054
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

03:24:50.054 --> 03:24:51.674
TALIESIN: Christmas constitution saving throw.

03:24:51.674 --> 03:24:54.311
MARISHA: Come on.
LAURA: You can do it, Fjord.

03:24:55.441 --> 03:24:56.666
TRAVIS: 12.

03:24:57.784 --> 03:24:59.626
TALIESIN: Constitution save of 17.
MATT: Yeah.

03:24:59.626 --> 03:25:02.414
So you go blind, your eyes just go completely dark

03:25:02.414 --> 03:25:05.474
and you can see nothing.
TRAVIS: Well, this sucks.

03:25:05.474 --> 03:25:06.734
MATT: You're still holding him.

03:25:08.554 --> 03:25:11.124
So you have him at the entrance, you lose sight.

03:25:11.124 --> 03:25:12.634
He took his action,

03:25:12.634 --> 03:25:15.084
which mean he hasn't broken from your grasp,

03:25:15.084 --> 03:25:16.064
and next turn he can try,

03:25:16.064 --> 03:25:18.224
and he'll put you at disadvantage

03:25:18.224 --> 03:25:19.530
to try and continue to hold him, grapple him.

03:25:19.530 --> 03:25:21.234
MARISHA: Use your swimmer's instinct.

03:25:21.234 --> 03:25:23.284
MATT: So what are you going to do?

03:25:23.284 --> 03:25:25.127
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and...

03:25:26.184 --> 03:25:28.864
I will cast my last thing.

03:25:28.864 --> 03:25:31.101
I'll cast Command again.

03:25:32.404 --> 03:25:34.684
MATT: Does Command have a somatic?
TRAVIS: Wisdom save.

03:25:34.684 --> 03:25:37.552
Oh, yeah, I'll let go of him.

03:25:37.552 --> 03:25:38.434
No, it's verbal.

03:25:38.434 --> 03:25:39.884
MATT: Okay, so yeah, you can do it.

03:25:39.884 --> 03:25:41.434
What do you Command him to do?

03:25:41.434 --> 03:25:44.104
TRAVIS: Swim back to our group.

03:25:45.054 --> 03:25:46.114
MATT: It's a single word.

03:25:46.114 --> 03:25:47.305
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:25:49.904 --> 03:25:52.204
Retreat?
MATT: Okay.

03:25:52.204 --> 03:25:54.014
TALIESIN: Yeah, that would--
MATT: Sure.

03:25:54.014 --> 03:25:56.534
Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

03:25:56.534 --> 03:25:58.324
TALIESIN: Keep rolling bad.

03:25:58.324 --> 03:25:59.424
Nope, that's--

03:26:00.444 --> 03:26:05.444
Fine, I rolled a-- finally rolled a 26.

03:26:05.444 --> 03:26:06.277
SAM: Geez.

03:26:06.277 --> 03:26:07.194
MATT: So the Command's not breaking through.

03:26:07.194 --> 03:26:08.027
You still have your movement

03:26:08.027 --> 03:26:09.704
and you can move him 15 feet

03:26:09.704 --> 03:26:11.504
in what you think is the backward direction.

03:26:11.504 --> 03:26:12.784
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

03:26:12.784 --> 03:26:15.067
TALIESIN: 30 because it's half his movement, right?

03:26:16.144 --> 03:26:18.294
MATT: Well, half his movement to do it,

03:26:18.294 --> 03:26:20.194
but he can move 30 feet in water.

03:26:20.194 --> 03:26:21.214
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:26:21.214 --> 03:26:24.084
MATT: So for him it's half speed to pull you back.

03:26:24.084 --> 03:26:25.524
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:26:25.524 --> 03:26:28.454
MATT: So you now pull him a
little bit away from the entrance.

03:26:28.454 --> 03:26:29.604
You're gaining on him,

03:26:29.604 --> 03:26:31.104
unless he was able to break away from you,

03:26:31.104 --> 03:26:33.704
you gather you can probably drag him back,

03:26:33.704 --> 03:26:35.414
you just don't really know which direction's back

03:26:35.414 --> 03:26:36.514
and you're hoping.

03:26:36.514 --> 03:26:38.334
TRAVIS: Yeah, I also don't want to touch

03:26:38.334 --> 03:26:41.224
those fire bloom shit, right?
MATT: Correct.

03:26:41.224 --> 03:26:43.574
You aren't certain where you are.

03:26:43.574 --> 03:26:44.407
TRAVIS: Yep, it's a bitch.

03:26:44.407 --> 03:26:45.614
MATT: Caduceus, what are you doing?

03:26:47.190 --> 03:26:48.504
TRAVIS: How long does Blindness last?

03:26:48.504 --> 03:26:50.704
TALIESIN: As long as-- you don't know.
MATT: It's a minute, right?

03:26:50.704 --> 03:26:52.091
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a minute.

03:26:52.091 --> 03:26:53.854
TRAVIS: I'm going to start Divine Smiting you.

03:26:53.854 --> 03:26:57.187
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and break free,

03:26:57.187 --> 03:26:58.212
finally break free.
MATT: All right, and go ahead and make contested--

03:26:58.212 --> 03:27:00.194
TALIESIN: Like a nice boy.
MATT: -- contested strength checks.

03:27:00.194 --> 03:27:02.554
TALIESIN: And I have advantage?
MATT: Hmm?

03:27:02.554 --> 03:27:04.024
TRAVIS: That's cocked.
MATT: You do because he's blind.

03:27:04.024 --> 03:27:06.854
TALIESIN: Contested strength check.

03:27:06.854 --> 03:27:08.314
One of them was a natural one,

03:27:08.314 --> 03:27:11.404
but the other one was 15.
TRAVIS: Five.

03:27:11.404 --> 03:27:12.824
MATT: Five.
SAM: Oh!

03:27:12.824 --> 03:27:15.834
MATT: Caduceus kicks out of your grip and you are blinded.

03:27:15.834 --> 03:27:17.944
You're not sure where he is,

03:27:17.944 --> 03:27:19.834
and you use the rest of your movement

03:27:19.834 --> 03:27:21.674
to go back into the entrance of the tunnel.

03:27:21.674 --> 03:27:24.584
SAM: Oh, shit.
MATT: Fjord, it's your turn.

03:27:24.584 --> 03:27:27.184
You have no vision, you know that Caduceus

03:27:27.184 --> 03:27:28.964
is somewhere probably in front of you.

03:27:28.964 --> 03:27:30.174
What are you doing?

03:27:30.174 --> 03:27:32.194
TRAVIS: Going backwards.
MATT: You're going backwards.

03:27:32.194 --> 03:27:33.744
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MATT: Okay.

03:27:33.744 --> 03:27:34.577
LIAM: Tried.

03:27:34.577 --> 03:27:35.410
TRAVIS: Can't see what's in front of me.

03:27:35.410 --> 03:27:36.434
LIAM: You tried real hard.
MATT: All right.

03:27:36.434 --> 03:27:38.094
TRAVIS: I'm right near the entrance to the thing, right?

03:27:38.094 --> 03:27:39.214
MATT: Yeah, you're about 15 feet away--

03:27:39.214 --> 03:27:42.244
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just going to do
three big reverse breast strokes

03:27:42.244 --> 03:27:44.404
and then just go straight up and start screaming.

03:27:44.404 --> 03:27:45.404
MATT: Okay.

03:27:45.404 --> 03:27:46.237
You guys--

03:27:46.237 --> 03:27:47.764
TALIESIN: Do I ever get a wisdom saving throw, or no?

03:27:47.764 --> 03:27:50.084
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:27:50.084 --> 03:27:55.084
MATT: So you guys, you hear the
breaking of the water surface,

03:27:55.354 --> 03:27:56.544
and Fjord, what do you?

03:27:56.544 --> 03:27:58.564
TRAVIS: Caduceus is going forward!

03:27:58.564 --> 03:28:00.304
He's being pulled!

03:28:00.304 --> 03:28:01.834
Get in here!
SAM: What?

03:28:01.834 --> 03:28:02.714
LAURA: What?
SAM: What?

03:28:02.714 --> 03:28:03.547
LAURA: What?

03:28:03.547 --> 03:28:05.974
LIAM: Everybody in the pool.
MARISHA: Okay.

03:28:05.974 --> 03:28:08.154
SAM: Oh, okay.
TRAVIS: Now!

03:28:08.154 --> 03:28:09.168
SAM: Okay, okay okay.
MARISHA: Sploosh.

03:28:09.168 --> 03:28:10.001
SAM: We're going!

03:28:10.001 --> 03:28:11.764
LIAM: I dive off whatever boat we're on.

03:28:11.764 --> 03:28:13.563
MATT: All right, you guys all immediately

03:28:13.563 --> 03:28:15.954
(splashing) start diving in the water.

03:28:15.954 --> 03:28:17.954
You are--
TRAVIS: Blind!

03:28:17.954 --> 03:28:19.704
MATT: Yep.
(laughter)

03:28:19.704 --> 03:28:21.034
So you guys, as you all begin to gather

03:28:21.034 --> 03:28:21.874
towards where Fjord is,

03:28:21.874 --> 03:28:24.294
you can see Fjord is treading water

03:28:24.294 --> 03:28:26.034
but is just--
TRAVIS: I can't see.

03:28:26.034 --> 03:28:28.907
He went down through the tunnel.

03:28:29.974 --> 03:28:33.031
Someone go get him. I'm useless.

03:28:33.031 --> 03:28:34.204
LAURA: Oh god.
MARISHA: All right,

03:28:34.204 --> 03:28:35.124
I'm going to go for it.

03:28:35.124 --> 03:28:36.754
MATT: Vilya's going to go ahead and use--

03:28:36.754 --> 03:28:38.814
TRAVIS: He blinded me!
MATT: -- a slot

03:28:38.814 --> 03:28:41.144
to cast Lesser Restoration.
SAM: Oh.

03:28:41.144 --> 03:28:43.224
LAURA: Oh, that's good, because
I don't have that one prepared.

03:28:43.224 --> 03:28:44.624
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think that does it.

03:28:44.624 --> 03:28:45.541
MATT: Yeah, I'm pretty sure Lesser Restoration is--

03:28:45.541 --> 03:28:47.004
LAURA: Yeah, that does Blindness.

03:28:47.004 --> 03:28:47.837
MATT: Blinded, yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:28:47.837 --> 03:28:49.044
MATT: So you have your vision back.

03:28:49.044 --> 03:28:50.534
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

03:28:50.534 --> 03:28:53.374
Can you give me my spell slots back?

03:28:53.374 --> 03:28:55.332
MATT: "I'm afraid I cannot."
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:28:55.332 --> 03:28:57.674
(laughter)

03:28:57.674 --> 03:28:59.434
MARISHA: I'm going to go for it.
LAURA: Yeah, same.

03:28:59.434 --> 03:29:01.198
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

03:29:01.198 --> 03:29:02.054
MARISHA: I dive in with the girls.

03:29:02.054 --> 03:29:05.211
MATT: You all dive in beneath the surface.

03:29:05.211 --> 03:29:06.372
MARISHA: We're going to go for it, I guess.

03:29:06.372 --> 03:29:07.444
ASHLEY: We're going to go for it.

03:29:07.444 --> 03:29:09.114
MATT: Head towards the orange glow

03:29:09.114 --> 03:29:11.864
where the torch bloom plants

03:29:11.864 --> 03:29:14.644
ring the interior of this tunnel sequence,

03:29:14.644 --> 03:29:16.884
where Caduceus is, from your current position,

03:29:16.884 --> 03:29:18.514
nowhere to be seen.
MARISHA: He's winding down.

03:29:18.514 --> 03:29:20.344
MATT: While Caduceus--
ASHLEY: He's winding down.

03:29:20.344 --> 03:29:24.034
MATT: -- you have to get there.
TALIESIN: Fuck me.

03:29:24.034 --> 03:29:25.892
MATT: There's something...

03:29:26.964 --> 03:29:29.524
Something important.
ASHLEY: Don't you do it.

03:29:29.524 --> 03:29:31.332
MATT: And nothing will stop you.

03:29:32.174 --> 03:29:33.834
And as you thrash your way,

03:29:33.834 --> 03:29:37.254
somehow knowing the path through these now

03:29:37.254 --> 03:29:40.764
continuously branching odd tunnels--

03:29:40.764 --> 03:29:42.055
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:29:43.114 --> 03:29:44.300
MATT: We're going to go ahead and pick up next week.

03:29:44.300 --> 03:29:45.644
ASHLEY: No!
(groaning)

03:29:45.644 --> 03:29:46.477
Dang it.

03:29:46.477 --> 03:29:48.724
SAM: What a terrible end.
TRAVIS: I'm fucking totally empty.

03:29:48.724 --> 03:29:50.616
TALIESIN: I'm not cool with this.

03:29:51.542 --> 03:29:53.194
I'm not cool with this at all.
LIAM: It was like a nice happy,

03:29:53.194 --> 03:29:57.094
sleepy, content mid-point, and now just--

03:29:57.094 --> 03:29:59.194
LAURA: I was seriously like, we should all sit down

03:29:59.194 --> 03:30:01.314
and have a Heroes' Feast before we do anything,

03:30:01.314 --> 03:30:04.124
and then we just got sucked in.

03:30:04.124 --> 03:30:05.144
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:30:05.144 --> 03:30:06.434
Just really sucked in.

03:30:06.434 --> 03:30:08.924
MATT: Well, the good news is,

03:30:08.924 --> 03:30:10.864
he's swimming at half speed,

03:30:10.864 --> 03:30:12.454
all of you are swimming at half speed

03:30:12.454 --> 03:30:14.114
unless you take other forms.

03:30:14.114 --> 03:30:15.304
Fjord swims at full speed,

03:30:15.304 --> 03:30:17.424
and while you are behind,

03:30:17.424 --> 03:30:19.554
there is an opportunity to possibly catch up.

03:30:19.554 --> 03:30:20.387
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:30:20.387 --> 03:30:23.424
MATT: But we'll see what that looks like next week

03:30:23.424 --> 03:30:26.064
because now it's a chase for your own party member

03:30:26.064 --> 03:30:28.564
who is being compelled,

03:30:28.564 --> 03:30:31.264
and to see if you can follow him

03:30:31.264 --> 03:30:34.494
through a network of tunnels that he knows the way.

03:30:34.494 --> 03:30:36.174
SAM: Ooh.
LAURA: Ah, jeez.

03:30:36.174 --> 03:30:37.164
LIAM: And no prep time

03:30:37.164 --> 03:30:40.204
for possibly going to knock on Avocado's door.

03:30:40.204 --> 03:30:42.384
SAM: Oh man.
LAURA: And no spells left.

03:30:42.384 --> 03:30:44.764
SAM: It's D&amp;D!
MATT: Yeah.

03:30:44.764 --> 03:30:46.366
MARISHA: Woo!
SAM: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond ♪

03:30:46.366 --> 03:30:48.017
(laughter)
MATT: So.

03:30:48.017 --> 03:30:49.591
LAURA: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: Boy.

03:30:49.591 --> 03:30:50.644
TALIESIN: I love you guys.
LIAM: Love it.

03:30:50.644 --> 03:30:52.235
MATT: I love you guys.
SAM: It's so great.

03:30:52.235 --> 03:30:53.875
MATT: I wasn't expecting that to happen.

03:30:53.875 --> 03:30:55.134
ASHLEY: No way.
SAM: So great.

03:30:55.134 --> 03:30:56.314
MATT: That was exciting.

03:30:56.314 --> 03:30:57.147
All right, cool.

03:30:57.147 --> 03:30:58.344
We're going to pick up there next week

03:30:58.344 --> 03:31:00.514
to see where this goes.

03:31:00.514 --> 03:31:02.476
In the meantime, everyone,

03:31:03.444 --> 03:31:06.084
take time to tell anyone you care about that you love them,

03:31:06.084 --> 03:31:07.464
every chance you get.

03:31:07.464 --> 03:31:11.167
And on that same note, we love you all very much.

03:31:11.167 --> 03:31:13.224
Have a wonderful week, we'll see you soon,

03:31:13.224 --> 03:31:15.614
and is it Thursday yet?

03:31:15.614 --> 03:31:17.973
Good night.
TRAVIS: No!

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.240
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.460
tonight's episode of Critical Role

3
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.620
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.173
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.173 --> 00:00:07.717
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:08.810
MATT: There you have it.

7
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.870
Before we jump into tonight's session,

8
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.869
we do have some announcements

9
00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.069
that'll begin with some sponsors,

10
00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:16.470
but part of the first sponsorship

11
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.510
ties in with one of the announcements,

12
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.060
so I'll go and get to that first.

13
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.600
For those who haven't seen on social media,

14
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.950
the announcements and such,

15
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.760
we've partnered with our friends at

16
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.730
Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Wizards of the Coast

17
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.967
to release an upcoming

18
00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:32.191
Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, an actual--

19
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:33.340
(cheering)

20
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.230
full setting, full campaign setting

21
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.740
for the entirety of the continent

22
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.580
of Wildemount that you guys have watched

23
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.510
in this campaign and so much more beyond that.

24
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.920
It's been, like, a year plus of my life

25
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.180
on top of everything else to work it out.

26
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.050
I'm super proud of it and the wonderful contributors

27
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.610
that helped flesh out the world

28
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150
even just beyond what I had worked on.

29
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.590
It's something I'm really proud of and I hope you guys

30
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590
have an opportunity to check it out.

31
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.600
It's up for preorder now where are places

32
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.500
you can mostly find RPG book preorders

33
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.950
and it'll be coming out on March 17th,

34
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.390
so about two months from now.

35
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.420
It's got not just, like, world lore

36
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.710
and, you know, a lot of elements about

37
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.110
just the story and setting-centric stuff,

38
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.370
there's a lot of player options

39
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.360
including three new sub-classes, dunamancy spells,

40
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.090
some new sub-races, some other fun stuff, new creatures,

41
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.580
new magical items, new artifacts and Vestiges of Divergence.

42
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.570
It's going to be a lot of fun, so I hope you enjoy it.

43
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.720
And for those of you who are looking to buy it

44
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.280
or preorder it and can afford it,

45
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.840
I highly recommend you go do so at your local game store.

46
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.110
You know, online sometimes is the only way people

47
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.580
can afford it, but if you can, support those local shops.

48
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.499
That's where the community thrives, so definitely do so.

49
00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.765
(whooping)

50
00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:51.250
And leading into that, our first sponsor tonight

51
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.740
is our returning friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

52
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.880
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

53
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.810
MATT: Which, on D&amp;D Beyond, preorders for

54
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.280

56
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.070

58
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.380

You can grab the digital version right now and receive

61
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.930
a bonus, looks like six exclusive character sheet

62
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.110
backgrounds in six matching color themes

63
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.610
to go with the book's release,

64
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.020
which is awesome, and they also have

65
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.750
some other great promos going that you can find

66
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.810
on the site at dndbeyond.link/critter.

67
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.780
Go ahead and check that out and thank you guys so much

68
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.270
for supporting our show for as long as you have.

69
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.107
Our second sponsor tonight, (clears throat)

70
00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:40.284
as I prepare myself, is NordVPN. Sam.

71
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.930
SAM: Hold my calls and greetings, netizens!

72
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.700
It's the master of the dark web,

73
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.150
online known as blackwillow73@aol.com.

74
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.100
I'm cracking code and spinning my webs with ease

75
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.290
because my hardware's protected by NordVPN,

76
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.580
a personal virtual private network service provider

77
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.230
with 5,000 servers in 60 countries

78
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.650
that shields you from hackzors like me,

79
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.280
protects you on public wifi, and even blocks annoying ads.

80
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.620
Yeah, I know everything about

81
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.150
the info super-biway except the identity

82
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.110
of that black hat evildoer, Cryptonic Override.

83
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.896
But tonight, I'm going to jack in

84
00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:23.930
(laughter)

85
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.788
to their mainframe

86
00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:29.859
and expose them to the world wide world.

87
00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.620
(keyboard clicking) Here we go.

88
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.630
Jamming the matrix, hashing the DDR.

89
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.360
What, I've been sliced?

90
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.273
CRYPTONIC OVERRIDE (V.O.): Aw, so close, Black Willow,

91
00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:44.898
but I, Cryptonic Override, am also using NordVPN.

92
00:03:44.898 --> 00:03:46.470
They have a promo going on right now

93
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.600
which gives you 70% off a three-year plan

94
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.640
and one extra month for free.

95
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.293
Oh well, have a slice day. (laughs)

96
00:03:57.293 --> 00:03:59.330
SAM: Ah, I failed.

97
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.010
Or did I?

98
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.510
Computer, reload that audio clip

99
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.494
but retro-flop the transmish.

100
00:04:06.494 --> 00:04:07.780
CRYPTONIC OVERRIDE (V.O.): [Fragmented] Have a slice day.

101
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.760
SAM: Okay, now un-route the bus map

102
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.542
and quantize the Fraggle Rock.

103
00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.430
(zapping)

104
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.370
Closer.

105
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.880
Now backdate the disco dongle and enhance.

106
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.844
CRYPTONIC OVERRIDE (V.O.)" Have a slice day,

107
00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:21.870
slice, slice, sli-sli-slice.

108
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.270
LAURA (V.O.): Have a slice day. (laughs)

109
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.303
SAM: Wait, Cryptonic Override is...

110
00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:30.910
Laura Bailey?!

111
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.629
ASHLEY: What?!
TRAVIS: Whoa!

112
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:33.640
SAM: (screaming)

113
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.970
LAURA: You cracked my code, Black Willow.

114
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.928
Let's settle this the way all leet hackzors do,

115
00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:40.519
with a head-to-head hack off.

116
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.050
SAM: (gasping)
LAURA: Do you accept?

117
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.696
SAM: 0111001,

118
00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:48.137
which is binary for

119
00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:49.437
yes!

120
00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:52.238
LAURA: Ready, set, hack!

121
00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:54.060
(keyboards clicking)

122
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.730
SAM: Oh, you're putting spyware on my aux interface?

123
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.005
Try re-troglodyting the CD-ROM.

124
00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:02.940
LAURA: Oh, a triple-ask encounter virus?

125
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.188
1995 called, Sandra Bullock wants her moves back.

126
00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:07.824
(keyboards clicking)
(laughter)

127
00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:10.050
SAM: Oh, you're trying to scramble my jumbotron?

128
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.366
Yeah, good luck. It's password protected.

129
00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.474
LAURA: Ha! It's swordfish.

130
00:05:14.474 --> 00:05:17.390
It's always swordfish.
SAM: Damn it!

131
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.890
(groans) No, you're gleaming my cube!

132
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.500
LAURA: That's right, Black Willow, you're going down--

133
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.040
SAM and LAURA: Huh?!

134
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.100
SAM: Wait, we both got sliced?

135
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.250
LAURA: Simul-sliced.
SAM: But by who?

136
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.570
How?
LAURA: Oh my god.

137
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.470
The Ultra Codex.

138
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.340
It's, it's going to infect the whole world.

139
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.700
SAM: Which means we're going to have to--

140
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.925
SAM and LAURA: Hack the planet.

141
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.360
SAM: Find out what happens next time,

142
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.010

Matt?

147
00:06:00.578 --> 00:06:02.043
SAM and LAURA: Hack to you.

148
00:06:02.043 --> 00:06:04.135
(laughter)

149
00:06:04.135 --> 00:06:08.963
LIAM: I think you mean if, <i>if</i> NordVPN sponsors us.

150
00:06:08.963 --> 00:06:10.617
SAM: Laura Bailey.
MATT: Laura Bailey.

151
00:06:10.617 --> 00:06:12.738
(cheering)

152
00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:14.438
MATT: I'm not going to lie,

153
00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:15.679
now I'm invested.

154
00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.967
(laughter)

155
00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:20.115
SAM: What is the Ultra Codex, Matt?

156
00:06:20.115 --> 00:06:21.900
You don't know.
MATT: I don't know.

157
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.786
Who does, who does?
TRAVIS: It's a new top ten.

158
00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:25.610
MARISHA: That was just well done.

159
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.939
LIAM: Do we have any time left to play D&amp;D, though?

160
00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.406
MATT: We'll try and squeeze it in.
LIAM: Okay.

161
00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:32.789
ASHLEY: Well, apparently the planet needs to be hacked.

162
00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.510
TALIESIN: Yeah.
ASHLEY: We better--

163
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.220
TRAVIS: Troglodyte got me.
MATT: I can't even.

164
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.380
TALIESIN: Swordfish hurt.
MATT: Thank you, Sam,

165
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.600
thank you, Laura, and thank you, NordVPN for sponsoring us.

166
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.510
ASHLEY: Simul-slice?
MATT: Simul-slice.

167
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.750
Simul-slice was pretty good.
ASHLEY: It's hardcore.

168
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.310
SAM: It's a dangerous world.

169
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.900
MATT: So, those are the announcements.

170
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.510
Unless anyone else has anything else they want to mention,

171
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.240
I think that's the end of our list

172
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.750
and we can jump into tonight's session.

173
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.700
So, let's go ahead and jump into

174
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.013
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

175
00:07:02.013 --> 00:07:04.957
(growling)

176
00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:07.078

MATT: And welcome back.

208
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:47.605
So we'll have a Laura Bailey here now, there she is.

209
00:08:47.605 --> 00:08:48.438
(cheering)

210
00:08:48.438 --> 00:08:49.711
Welcome back, welcome back.

211
00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:52.597
LAURA: My leet gear off.
MATT: I understand.

212
00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:55.760
Don't want to lose your focus.

213
00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.249
So last we left off, The Mighty Nein

214
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:02.706
have been working between the Dwendalian Empire

215
00:09:02.706 --> 00:09:05.828
and the Kryn Dynasty to try and arrange some sort of

216
00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:08.866
negotiation to bring us to a semblance of

217
00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:10.831
peace talks between these two places.

218
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:13.088
You were given the option by King Dwendal

219
00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:16.133
to essentially clear the slate of what could be

220
00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:18.655
some problematic behavior from their perspective

221
00:09:18.655 --> 00:09:22.150
in your dealings with the Dynasty by arranging this.

222
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.960
You went ahead and ran some errands,

223
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.449
fought some people in a basement of a butchery,

224
00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:32.163
ordered some musical instruments,

225
00:09:32.163 --> 00:09:35.976
and then eventually made your way back to Rosohna

226
00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:40.776
where you checked into your Xhorhaus in Xhorhas,

227
00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:44.686
met up with Shadowhand Essek, and made your way

228
00:09:44.686 --> 00:09:47.344
to the Bright Queen's throne room.

229
00:09:47.344 --> 00:09:49.996
There, you beseeched her, on behalf of the Dwendalian Empire

230
00:09:49.996 --> 00:09:52.451
and the relationship you already forged,

231
00:09:52.451 --> 00:09:57.135
to listen to what you had to say, what you've discovered,

232
00:09:57.135 --> 00:10:00.605
what you've accomplished, and what you were sent to do.

233
00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:04.497
Through some relatively persuasive arguments

234
00:10:04.497 --> 00:10:08.068
and some key notes made in the center

235
00:10:08.068 --> 00:10:11.677
of that chamber within the Lucid Bastion,

236
00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:13.598
you succeeded in convincing her to allow

237
00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:15.971
not only for it to happen, but for you guys

238
00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:19.958
to be somewhat present during these negotiations.

239
00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:25.420
You were sent to return this information onward to

240
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.546
the Dwendalian Empire and an arrangement will be made

241
00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:32.408
at some point in the future where these will take place,

242
00:10:32.408 --> 00:10:35.855
under the absolutely necessary scenario

243
00:10:35.855 --> 00:10:38.519
that the ceasefire is maintained on both sides.

244
00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:40.967
There is very much a mutually assured

245
00:10:40.967 --> 00:10:45.818
reinstated conflict should anything poorly go down.

246
00:10:45.818 --> 00:10:50.818
You returned towards the Xhorhaus, you

247
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.146
messaged an encroaching series of questions upon Essek,

248
00:10:55.146 --> 00:10:58.159
you went into your home, and after

249
00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:00.843
setting yourselves up in the early parts of the evening

250
00:11:00.843 --> 00:11:04.901
to have a night back in the house that you were gifted

251
00:11:04.901 --> 00:11:08.011
based on your deeds here in Rosohna,

252
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:11.366
began to play a cacophony

253
00:11:11.366 --> 00:11:14.548
of musical something.

254
00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:16.729
Actually, you were doing pretty good

255
00:11:16.729 --> 00:11:18.600
along with the tiny piano and the--

256
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.776
TALIESIN: There's only so much you can do with a--

257
00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:21.645
MATT: There's only so much you can do with a bone flute.

258
00:11:21.645 --> 00:11:23.341
LIAM: I think Frumpkin rolled the highest.

259
00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:26.768
MATT: I think so, but Frumpkin usually does.

260
00:11:26.768 --> 00:11:31.009
When he's not killed in one hit. (laughs)

261
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:32.771
So,

262
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:36.472
after your loud performance display,

263
00:11:36.472 --> 00:11:38.709
thrashing the ears of the neighborhood,

264
00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:40.563
who had thought it calm and silent

265
00:11:40.563 --> 00:11:43.163
for oh so long in your absence--

266
00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:44.072
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

267
00:11:44.072 --> 00:11:46.964
MATT: What would you like to do with the evening?

268
00:11:46.964 --> 00:11:50.040
You're hungry, you're tired.

269
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.989
SAM: Essek isn't with us or anything, right?

270
00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:53.178
MATT: Mm-mm.
SAM: No.

271
00:11:53.178 --> 00:11:54.522
TRAVIS: You want food, you want to sleep?

272
00:11:54.522 --> 00:11:57.165
You're hungry, you're tired, whatta you want?

273
00:11:57.165 --> 00:11:58.691
(laughter)

274
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:00.131
MARISHA: Fjord's been drinking.

275
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:01.731
(laughter)

276
00:12:01.731 --> 00:12:03.329
LIAM: Damn that Mask of Many Faces.

277
00:12:03.329 --> 00:12:04.827
(laughter)

278
00:12:04.827 --> 00:12:06.767
MARISHA: New face, new face!

279
00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:09.250
SAM: Well, maybe before we go to bed, we should plot out

280
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.960
our next moves for the next few days, weeks.

281
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.522
We've done our duty here, we don't have to

282
00:12:16.522 --> 00:12:18.200
hurry back to Rexxentrum, yeah?

283
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.180
Do we?
TRAVIS: That's true.

284
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.303
SAM: I mean, are we, are we meant to contact

285
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.410
the Dwendal's people and tell them about the arrangement?

286
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.530
TRAVIS: In time.
LAURA: We probably should, yeah.

287
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.880
TALIESIN: That will be the next thing and then probably

288
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.930
getting the ship in order, I guess.

289
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.030
TRAVIS: Yes.
SAM: But there's no pressing,

290
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.850
like, we don't have to do that today, right?

291
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.020
LIAM: Well, the longer we wait, the more of a chance

292
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.020
there is for something to slip and the--

293
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.620
LAURA: Oh, right.
LIAM: War to restart.

294
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.880
LAURA: We have to let them know right away

295
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.890
to, like, hey, not fight.
SAM: Yes, yes,

296
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.090
we do have to let them know right away.

297
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.660
LAURA: Yeah, so we should contact them now, tonight?

298
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.210
Did I already do that?
TALIESIN: I think we did that.

299
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.940
MARISHA: We did, you messaged--
MATT: Ludinus, yeah.

300
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.850
LAURA: Oh, that's right, we did, we did.

301
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.400
Hey, we're so, I remember that, of course.

302
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.710
TALIESIN: I say we have a
leisurely evening, a leisurely morning,

303
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.290
make our way back tomorrow.
SAM: To?

304
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.887
TALIESIN: To deliver whatever other information we need to.

305
00:13:15.887 --> 00:13:18.310
TRAVIS: You have armor to pick up here.

306
00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.131
ASHLEY: (gasping)

307
00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:22.973
TRAVIS: Right?
ASHLEY: Yes. I do.

308
00:13:22.973 --> 00:13:25.440
I forgot about that, but I have to--

309
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.600
LAURA: Do you have to finish paying for it?

310
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.520
ASHLEY: Finish paying for it, which I think,

311
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.450
how much do I have left on it?

312
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.340
MATT: Believe it was about 2,000 gold left on that.

313
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.270
LAURA: Yikes!
TALIESIN: We can make that.

314
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.290
ASHLEY: It is 2,000.

315
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.290
SAM: I've been keeping a little mental to do list.

316
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.300
Can I just run it through you guys and you can

317
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.000
tell me what's important on the to do list?

318
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.960
LAURA: Totally.
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course.

319
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.090
SAM: 'Kay, there's Traveler Con.
LAURA: Yeah, that's coming up soon.

320
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.070
SAM: How soon?
TRAVIS: Weeks.

321
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.700
MATT: About five weeks, little over five weeks, maybe.

322
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.350
LAURA: I have to make sure Orly's going to

323
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.830
be there when we get there.

324
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.090
I wonder how long it's going to take

325
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.690
to get from Nicodranas over there.

326
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.970
I'll have to contact Orly.
TALIESIN: Do we need costumes?

327
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.670
Do we need anything, like, is there a uniform?

328
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.700
I don't know.

329
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.210
TRAVIS: Assuming our ship survives this treaty talks.

330
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.250
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Other things in my

331
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.140
mental list to do list that's written down,

332
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.729
Darrow, maybe scry on him.
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

333
00:14:24.729 --> 00:14:25.811
we could do that.
TRAVIS: Why?

334
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:26.790
SAM: Because he's got a client

335
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.226
that he won't tell us about!
LAURA: And he won't tell us who

336
00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:30.810
it is, obviously.
SAM: We could scry on him

337
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.010
and find out who the client is and get useful intel

338
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.690
or at least just fuck with him.

339
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.320
TRAVIS: That's true, yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

340
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.736
All good options.

341
00:14:38.736 --> 00:14:41.150
SAM: Vence, scry on him.

342
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.270
LAURA: He's unscryable.
SAM: Mm.

343
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.880
TRAVIS: With the necklace thingy.
LAURA: Yeah.

344
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.880
SAM: Pride Silk at Pride's Call for Keona?

345
00:14:51.202 --> 00:14:52.519
MARISHA: Yeah, that's kind of like a--

346
00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:53.900
ASHLEY: She wanted the worms--
MARISHA: Yeah,

347
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.070
It's kind of a bonus one.

348
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.060
You have to smuggle out the worms and then we could get paid

349
00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.720
a decent amount of money.
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

350
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.340
MARISHA: But the worms are real big and real sacred

351
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.070
and they're real protective of them,

352
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.920
so it'd be like a worm heist.

353
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.790
TRAVIS: That seems like plenty of areas

354
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.640
for us to fuck up--
MARISHA: Yeah.

355
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.829
LAURA: Cool, though.
SAM: There are Jagentoths

356
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:17.010
in Shadycreek Run that exist.

357
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.320
TRAVIS: Jagentoths.
SAM: I don't know.

358
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.480
MARISHA: I mean, we kind of of knew that, though.

359
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.490
SAM: Yeah, but did we need to go

360
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.710
and look it up or something?

361
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.501
MARISHA: Did we want to murder them?
SAM: I don't know.

362
00:15:25.501 --> 00:15:26.950
MARISHA: Oh, I don't know.
TRAVIS: Are we murdering people?

363
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.510
SAM: Maybe?
MARISHA: Are we--

364
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.350
LAURA: Should I send them a message and let them know that

365
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.104
we're going to kill them?
MARISHA: I feel like,

366
00:15:32.104 --> 00:15:32.937
(laughter)

367
00:15:32.937 --> 00:15:34.690
that, (sputters)

368
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.620
okay, hang on, though.

369
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.860
Should we-- are we above,

370
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.650
we've risen up in echelon in society, right,

371
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.660
to not murder people without cause, right?
TRAVIS: Which society are you talking about?

372
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.630
The Dynasty or the Empire?
MARISHA: The, the human one, the--

373
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.100
TRAVIS: I'm not human.
MARISHA: You know, where--

374
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.860
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself.
MARISHA: Well, no, okay, the--

375
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.190
SAM: Civilization.
MARISHA: Thank you, civilization.

376
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:04.200
LIAM: We are rather high profile everywhere now.

377
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.850
LAURA: There's the, who?

378
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.730
LIAM: We are well known--
LAURA: We are?!

379
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.297
LIAM: We are The Mighty Nein of--
TRAVIS: ♪ We are, we are. ♪

380
00:16:11.297 --> 00:16:12.753
(snapping)

381
00:16:12.753 --> 00:16:13.620
MARISHA: ♪ The youth of the nation. ♪
SAM: Couple other, couple other

382
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.920
options for us.
MARISHA: That's exactly

383
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.364
what I'm saying.
SAM: Caduceus has

384
00:16:17.364 --> 00:16:20.560
some unfinished family business, I believe.

385
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.900
TALIESIN: I figure that's in the direction of Traveler Con.

386
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.310
I figured I would hit you all up for accompanying me

387
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.070
to that.
LAURA: On the way?

388
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.920
TALIESIN: Either on the way or after,

389
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.280
whichever is more convenient.

390
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.470
On the way would be wonderful.

391
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.520
SAM: I also wrote down "snea snake" for some reason.

392
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.870
Don't know what that means.

393
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.968
TRAVIS: I don't know.

394
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.808
SAM: And we need basilisk oil for Pumat Sol.

395
00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:47.920
LAURA: (gasps) Oh.
SAM: Those are the outstanding

396
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.192
to do list items.
LAURA: Did he say where

397
00:16:49.192 --> 00:16:51.710
we were supposed to get that?
TRAVIS: That's a good list.

398
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.800
LAURA: That is a really good list.
TRAVIS: Shit.

399
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.000
You need to stop by somewhere on,

400
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.550
and where is it on our, if we're up

401
00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.130
in Xhorhas and we're going down?

402
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.940
TALIESIN: I'll probably scry a bit more,
but it's a little past,

403
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.100
if I recall, if I--
MATT: The place that you've

404
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.170
been contemplating would be the possible location for this

405
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.140
is south of Xhorhas, to the east of Nicodranas.

406
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.900
It's-- if you want to pull up a--
TALIESIN: Pull up a map.

407
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.870
MATT: A map of the Menagerie Coast, perhaps.

408
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:21.530
ASHLEY: Is this the right one?
TALIESIN: Uh, no.

409
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.750
MATT: Menagerie Coast and/or Xhorhas.

410
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.750
Want to set them both out?

411
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.900
TALIESIN: We have so many maps.

412
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.980
MATT: How far down does the Xhorhas one go?

413
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.110
LAURA: We need the Coast, there it is.

414
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.296
MATT: This is where,

415
00:17:32.296 --> 00:17:33.129
(paper rustling)

416
00:17:33.129 --> 00:17:36.620
(feet scuffling)
(chairs knocking)

417
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.660
that is where you're thinking,

418
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.040
the Whitedawn Lagoon, and--

419
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.180
TALIESIN: Whitedawn, there we are.

420
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.710
MATT: This would link approximately about

421
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.103
there,

422
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.130
in this vicinity.

423
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.440
TALIESIN: Can I invent a Thomas guide?

424
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.100
MARISHA: I was just laughing at that.
TALIESIN: I so felt that.

425
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.450
I felt it, I felt it from you.

426
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.320
MARISHA: So, the negotiation, the location

427
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.470
where you had it agreed upon, which was

428
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.150
between the Whitedawn Lagoon and Nicodranas--

429
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.330
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Which is

430
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.510
just south of the border between Xhorhas and the Empire.

431
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.679
LAURA: Okay.

432
00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:12.080
(paper rustling)

433
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.140
MATT: So, it's either,

434
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.390
depending on where you start,

435
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.420
wherever your ship picks you up, either you go there before,

436
00:18:19.714 --> 00:18:20.890
if you're coming from Xhorhas' direction,

437
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.760
or go there after if you're coming from Nicodranas,

438
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.840
it'd be like your easiest one.

439
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.020
It's up to you.
LAURA: Go through Xhorhas.

440
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.160
TALIESIN: We could do that, I would appreciate that.

441
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.360
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: Not going to pretend

442
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.085
I'm not a little nervous, but yeah.

443
00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:35.390
MATT: (knocking)
MARISHA: Hit your place on the way down to--

444
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.640
SAM: Oh, someone starts knocking on the door.

445
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.640
MATT: There's a knock at the door.

446
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.473
LAURA: Who is--
MARISHA: Wait,

447
00:18:38.473 --> 00:18:39.490
do we need to hide anything?

448
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:40.750
Is anything out that's illegal?

449
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.790
TRAVIS: Like, beside ourselves?

450
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.150
TALIESIN: I'm going to go to the door.

451
00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.630
MATT: Mmkay.

452
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.620
You go ahead and peek through

453
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.400
the curtain there in the front and you see behind it

454
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.290
the familiar visage of Essek, the Shadowhand.

455
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.170
TALIESIN: Oh, hey.
SAM: We just saw you.

456
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.870
TALIESIN: Opening the door.
LIAM: Ting-a-ding-ding-ding.

457
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.970
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MARISHA: Is this a noise complaint?

458
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.130
MATT: "No, it is not a noise complaint.

459
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.302
"I just, ah,

460
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.420
"if you would have a guest for dinner, perhaps?"

461
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.620
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Come on in, Essek,

462
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.710
we invited you before!

463
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.200
Come, come, come.
MATT: "I thought about it.

464
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.160
"I hadn't really, you know, done something like this

465
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.740
"in a while and perhaps it is--

466
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.360
"something I should do."

467
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.246
MARISHA: Insight check.
LAURA: Oh yeah.

468
00:19:27.246 --> 00:19:30.470
MATT: Make an insight check.
TRAVIS: "Do I, do I believe him?"

469
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.800
is what she wants to say.
MARISHA: Does he have,

470
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.010
do I believe him with an

471
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.000
insight check?
MATT: I know,

472
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.390
make an insight check.
SAM: Did he bring the wine?

473
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:38.250
MATT: Actually, he did.
LAURA: Ah!

474
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.710
MATT: He takes it out from under
his cloak and hands it over.

475
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.710
"This is Solvia Groves Diamond Plum Wine."

476
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.740
SAM: Oh!

477
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.366
I'll decant it right away.

478
00:19:48.366 --> 00:19:50.240
(laughter)

479
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.013
MARISHA: Yeah, natural 20.
MATT: Natural 20?

480
00:19:54.013 --> 00:19:55.163
TRAVIS: Holy.
SAM: All right.

481
00:19:55.163 --> 00:19:58.060
TALIESIN: He has do a little spin
on the way over for a natural 20.

482
00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.140
SAM: Wow, wow.
TRAVIS: This whisper is

483
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.460
brought to you by--
SAM: NordVPN.

484
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.400
They can protect you on the internet.

485
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.340
Nothing can protect us from the dangers

486
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.270
that abound in Wildemount, but--

487
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.619
ASHLEY: If you don't split-slicers.
SAM: "Split-slicers"? Simul-slicers?

488
00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:14.719
ASHLEY: That's hard.

489
00:20:14.719 --> 00:20:16.210
I was like, "This isn't it."

490
00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.329
Also, that's very hard to say.

491
00:20:18.329 --> 00:20:20.740
TALIESIN: Spit-slicers.
SAM: This is why Laura got the job.

492
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.790
(laughter)

493
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.560
ASHLEY: I really, I mean, it was a bad audition.

494
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.790
I was having a bad day.

495
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.729
TRAVIS: "This is hard to say."

496
00:20:26.729 --> 00:20:29.130
MATT: (clears throat)

497
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.090
"My apologies."

498
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.160
And you watch as he,

499
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.340
after stepping into the chamber

500
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.680
and handing off the bottle of wine,

501
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.398
he (whoosh) stops hovering and lands on his feet

502
00:20:39.398 --> 00:20:43.073
and unfastens the mantle.
SAM: Oh, we're going to see behind the curtain?

503
00:20:43.073 --> 00:20:43.906
LAURA: His body?

504
00:20:43.906 --> 00:20:45.888
LIAM: It's just a little baby body.

505
00:20:45.888 --> 00:20:47.230
(laughter)

506
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.983
SAM: It's like a reverse Krang.

507
00:20:48.983 --> 00:20:51.790
(laughter)

508
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.518
MATT: Don't Google reverse Krang, by the way.

509
00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:56.230
(laughter)

510
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.803
LIAM: I did that once, in college.

511
00:20:57.803 --> 00:20:59.360
(laughter)

512
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.620
MATT: But no, he removes the mantle and sets it on

513
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.440
one of the chairs in the foyer area of the Xhorhaus

514
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.080
and he's dressed in a nice, comfortable clothes,

515
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.116
well-trimmed.
LAURA: Juicy Couture. (laughs)

516
00:21:10.116 --> 00:21:11.321
(laughter)

517
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:12.293
MATT: Yeah, it's just--

518
00:21:12.293 --> 00:21:13.126
(laughter)

519
00:21:13.126 --> 00:21:15.260
TRAVIS: Just says "juicy" on the ass.
MATT: Yep.

520
00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.847
It's from the Rosohna, it was

521
00:21:16.847 --> 00:21:20.070
Victoria's Secret, comfortable line.

522
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.770
No, it's actually not too different

523
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.860
from your Xhorhasian outfit as you had it tailored,

524
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.320
the design of which you requested is loosely based

525
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.120
on similar designs you've seen around the city

526
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.670
and his is more of a designer version of that,

527
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.171
but comfortable and sleek in that.
MARISHA: Designer, though.

528
00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:37.004
MATT: It would be.
LAURA: Fancy, he's fancy.

529
00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:37.845
MATT: He's fancy.

530
00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:39.540
TRAVIS: Do you float all the time?

531
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.770
I'm sorry, I called it float.

532
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:44.093
It just seems you're always gliding.

533
00:21:44.093 --> 00:21:45.420
MATT: "Not all the time.

534
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.680
"For me, it's more of a, (sighs)

535
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.890
"I don't know. It's an expectation, I guess."

536
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.280
TRAVIS: People expect it of you?

537
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.690
MATT: "When you're young and impetuous,

538
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.570
"you tend to do things to try and impress people

539
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.110
"and then once you've set a sort of expectation

540
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.505
"for a presentation, you have to maintain it."

541
00:22:04.505 --> 00:22:06.213
SAM: It's your gimmick!

542
00:22:06.213 --> 00:22:07.070
MATT: "More or less."

543
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:10.738
ASHLEY: So people just expect you to float everywhere?

544
00:22:10.738 --> 00:22:11.571
MATT: "Yes."

545
00:22:11.571 --> 00:22:13.279
TRAVIS: Does it make you tired?

546
00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:14.504
MATT: "Not particularly."

547
00:22:14.504 --> 00:22:16.113
TALIESIN: I mean, walking makes you tired,

548
00:22:16.113 --> 00:22:16.946
if you think about it.

549
00:22:16.946 --> 00:22:19.160
ASHLEY: Yeah, can you make anyone float?

550
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.970
Or it's just yourself?
MATT: "I mean,

551
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.240
"via certain incantations, of course, but this is

552
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.250
"more of just a developed for myself type trick.

553
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.040
"Gimmick, if you will."
LAURA: Bringing out some wine.

554
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.923
Here you go.
SAM: It still needs more time to aerate.

555
00:22:33.923 --> 00:22:36.640
TALIESIN: I'm going to go get
everything going in the kitchen.

556
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.915
I'll have everything up and running real quick.

557
00:22:38.915 --> 00:22:41.840
LIAM: You're in for a treat. Caduceus is quite a cook.

558
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.833
MATT: "I'm very excited. Thank you very much."

559
00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:45.540
SAM: Come into the dining room.

560
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.960
We have a dining room, right?
LAURA: So are you single?

561
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.810
Do you have kids?

562
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:48.643
What's your last name?

563
00:22:48.643 --> 00:22:49.476
SAM: Let's sit down

564
00:22:49.476 --> 00:22:51.154
and do some small talk first.
LAURA: Okay, come on in.

565
00:22:51.154 --> 00:22:53.651
TRAVIS: Oh, sit down.
ASHLEY: I'll build a fire.

566
00:22:53.651 --> 00:22:54.580
(chuckling)

567
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.262
SAM: Oh, I'll start heating up the
hot tub, just in case later.

568
00:22:57.262 --> 00:22:59.122
It takes like an hour or two to--

569
00:22:59.122 --> 00:23:00.550
TRAVIS: Very presumptuous.
SAM: Yes.

570
00:23:02.138 --> 00:23:04.121
MARISHA: Where you from?

571
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:06.028
MATT: "Here."
MARISHA: Are you married?

572
00:23:06.028 --> 00:23:07.469
MATT: "No."

573
00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:09.913
MARISHA: What's your mother's name?

574
00:23:09.913 --> 00:23:12.592
MATT: "Well, my mother's name is

575
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:20.740
"Deirta Thelyss, she is the Umavi of my den."

576
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.470
TRAVIS: Umavi.
LAURA: Oh, wow.

577
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.770
SAM: What was your last name again?

578
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.280
MATT: "Thelyss."
LAURA: Which den? Thelyss Den.

579
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.251
SAM: Thelyss, Den Thelyss.
MATT: "Yes."

580
00:23:29.251 --> 00:23:30.425
LAURA: Den Thelyss.

581
00:23:30.425 --> 00:23:33.830
MATT: "One of the multitude of dens. (chuckles)

582
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:34.821
"Shall we sit?"

583
00:23:34.821 --> 00:23:35.654
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

584
00:23:35.654 --> 00:23:38.479
Come on, have a seat on this couch.

585
00:23:38.479 --> 00:23:39.312
(chuckling)

586
00:23:39.312 --> 00:23:41.473
Assume we have couches.

587
00:23:41.473 --> 00:23:43.480
LIAM: We have ottomans.
TRAVIS: It's just chaise lounges.

588
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.690
LAURA: Just everywhere.

589
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.525
Please, faint on this fainting couch.

590
00:23:47.525 --> 00:23:48.990
MATT: "I'm not imposing, am I?"

591
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.590
LAURA: No, we were just playing a concert for--

592
00:23:53.253 --> 00:23:56.290
MATT: "I was wondering what that sound was."

593
00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.698
ASHLEY: That was us.

594
00:23:57.698 --> 00:23:59.180
MATT: "It carries quite a distance."

595
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.405
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah?
MATT: Yes.

596
00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:03.010
ASHLEY: Good.
TRAVIS: It's how we focus.

597
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.590
After a huge meeting,

598
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.870
we play

599
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.492
and join our thoughts as one.

600
00:24:10.492 --> 00:24:13.381
(laughter)

601
00:24:13.381 --> 00:24:16.697
MATT: "An unfamiliar custom, but--"

602
00:24:16.697 --> 00:24:18.297
TRAVIS: It grows on you.

603
00:24:18.297 --> 00:24:20.690
MATT: "Hey, it is not unlike some things

604
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.390
"I've seen in Asarius."
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

605
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.948
LIAM: Frumpkin jumps into his lap.
MATT: "Oh!

606
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:27.803
"Hello."

607
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.253
LIAM: So,

608
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.030
what is the mood here

609
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.620
in the Dynasty, here?

610
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.970
MATT: "Right now, it is tension.

611
00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:43.530
"A little bit of frustration in the halting of what was

612
00:24:45.477 --> 00:24:50.217
"to be a very successful raid on Rexxentrum."

613
00:24:52.921 --> 00:24:54.454
LAURA: (sighs)

614
00:24:54.454 --> 00:24:56.750
(muffled laughter)

615
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.151
MARISHA: Sprinkle.

616
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.053
MATT: "Tense.

617
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.970
"That's primarily it.

618
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.750
"This is so far removed from the front lines,

619
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.830
"it's mostly just information disseminated via

620
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:16.350
"word of mouth and the occasional street speaker, but

621
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.753
"warfare makes for...

622
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.685
"not entirely pleasant opinions of the opposing side."

623
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.710
LIAM: The tension in the throne
room was fairly easy to read.

624
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.980
My wonder what the dens, the various dens,

625
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.896
think, the people here?

626
00:25:39.896 --> 00:25:41.290
MATT: "That varies from den to den.

627
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.180
"There are numerous, and it depends

628
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.021
"on which opinion you want."

629
00:25:46.021 --> 00:25:47.563
LIAM: How about Den Thelyss?

630
00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:50.890
MATT: "Den Thelyss,

631
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.100
"they would like very much to see

632
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.950
"our nation established and respected

"in the broader sense of the world.

"Unfortunately, our most neighboring nation

"tends to consider most everything to the east

"dangerous cutthroats and

"drow killers and everything else, so."

639
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.233
LIAM: And that is foolish.

640
00:26:23.233 --> 00:26:25.850
That has not been our experience here.

641
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.366
MATT: "But there are people on our end

642
00:26:27.366 --> 00:26:29.199
"and many folks who assume that the Empire

643
00:26:29.199 --> 00:26:32.000
"is nothing but a bunch of

"money-crazed, murderous villagers ready to kill each other

"for a scrap of meat."

646
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.533
LAURA: That is very true.

647
00:26:39.533 --> 00:26:42.313
That's how everyone is there.

648
00:26:42.313 --> 00:26:43.608
MATT: "Really?"

649
00:26:43.608 --> 00:26:45.491
TRAVIS: Jester, that's not, that's--

650
00:26:45.491 --> 00:26:46.730
LAURA: Not true.

651
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.288
MATT: "I care little for politics, to be honest.

652
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:54.124
"But it seems you did as well, but circumstances

653
00:26:54.124 --> 00:26:57.663
"thrust us into spaces where we least expect."

654
00:26:57.663 --> 00:26:59.830
ASHLEY: What do you care for?

655
00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.610
What are, you know, your hobbies

656
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.602
and things that you like to do?

657
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.511
SAM: Pet peeves?

658
00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:08.430
TRAVIS: Allergies?

659
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.383
TALIESIN: Hopefully none of this.

660
00:27:09.383 --> 00:27:11.300
A cheese and vegetable plate comes out.

661
00:27:12.462 --> 00:27:13.870
MATT: The tension breaks

662
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.320
when you set it down and he's like,

663
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.990
"Thank you so much."
TALIESIN: Right.

664
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.810
Main course coming, thank you, thank you.

665
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.143
SAM: Thank you, Caduceus.
ASHLEY: This looks delicious.

666
00:27:21.143 --> 00:27:23.300
MARISHA: Do you need help in there, Caduceus?

667
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.333
TALIESIN: I'll be, I'll be just a minute, I'm fine.

668
00:27:25.333 --> 00:27:27.041
TRAVIS: That's a "stay the fuck out of the kitchen."

669
00:27:27.041 --> 00:27:28.720
MARISHA: Yeah, I got that.

670
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.816
TALIESIN: I'll cut you.

671
00:27:29.816 --> 00:27:32.884
(laughter)

672
00:27:32.884 --> 00:27:35.680
MARISHA: Wow, this is where Caduceus gets violent.

673
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.400
MATT: "You've asked me quite a few questions

674
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.690
"and I'm willing to converse, but I'm curious,

"What are the things you are looking to do?

"I assume you weren't intending to bring a Beacon here

"and throw yourself into the midst of this chaos, so...

00:28:04.512 --> 00:28:06.260
"what else it is pushes you forward?"

682
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.500
TRAVIS: Would it surprise you to
know that perhaps a year ago,

683
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.490
we didn't even know of a beacon

684
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.705
or of the Dynasty or of any of this?

685
00:28:13.705 --> 00:28:15.063
MATT: "Hmm."

686
00:28:15.063 --> 00:28:16.680
MARISHA: We knew of bacon,

687
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.146
just not of a beacon.

688

SAM: We all have individual goals and

690
00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:26.860
issues that we're working on, but--

691
00:28:28.454 --> 00:28:30.237
MATT: "What about you?"

692
00:28:30.237 --> 00:28:31.871
SAM: Oh, me?
MATT: "Yes."

693
00:28:31.871 --> 00:28:34.725
SAM: Um--
LAURA: Tell him.

694
00:28:34.725 --> 00:28:35.990
Maybe he can do it.

695
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.422
SAM: I'll take a big sip of wine.

696
00:28:38.422 --> 00:28:39.897
I--

697
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.458
I've just had some,

698
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.250
I'm not myself

699
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.980
and haven't been for a while and was--

700
00:28:52.174 --> 00:28:53.757
(sighs)

701
00:28:54.673 --> 00:28:57.814
like many of us, we're all searching for--

702
00:28:57.814 --> 00:29:00.676
well, many of us are searching for who we are,

703
00:29:00.676 --> 00:29:04.917
but mine is much more

704
00:29:04.917 --> 00:29:07.533
odd because I know I'm not,

705
00:29:07.533 --> 00:29:11.810
I'm not supposed to be like this and I'm trying to

706
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.069
change myself, physically.

707
00:29:14.069 --> 00:29:15.143

708
00:29:15.143 --> 00:29:16.860
"So this is not your original form?"

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.740
SAM: No, and actually, being in
the throne room of your Queen,

710
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.590
it actually gave me a lot of hope.

711
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.600
I mean, seeing that people among you

712
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.950
and her and some of the den leaders, I suppose,

713
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:38.950
have changed form and shape many times over and put their

714
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.265
spirits into other bodies.

00:29:41.265 --> 00:29:42.910
MATT: "This is true."

716
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.738
SAM: It's actually given me a lot of hope.

717
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.880
They said that, when we were in there,

718
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.490

00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:04.400

LAURA: Does it take a long time?

723
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.190

Not everyone in the Dynasty is consecuted,

753
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.150
so there are some that expire in this life

the process continues, yes."

you're the same person you were before?

SAM: Sounds very confusing.
MATT: "I'm sure.

"I've not done it myself."
LAURA: But, like,

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:48.290
LAURA: Can you just turn this body into a different body?

861
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.150
MATT: "I do not know of such magic myself, unfortunately.

"There are rumors of extremely powerful

MATT: "But if I hear anything, I will let you know."

867
00:37:08.477 --> 00:37:13.360
SAM: If we hear of something, could we ask your aid?

868
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.802
MATT: "If I can."
SAM: In deciphering it?

869
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.353
MATT: "If I can."

870
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.210
LAURA: So, you live alone, huh?

871
00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.513
MATT: "I do."

872
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:31.010
MARISHA: You mentioned that you felt like the Dynasty

873
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.710
could utilize its time for much better purposes.

874
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.947
What would <i>you</i> see the Dynasty do?

875

TRAVIS: Is that pursuit frowned upon or largely ignored?

890
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.850
Like a standard is kept and additional

891
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.270
knowledge not sought out?

892
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.080
MATT: "It's not so much ignored more than

893
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:34.902
"not as much of a priority."

894
00:38:37.101 --> 00:38:39.210
TRAVIS: It's like not knowing how deep the ocean is.

895
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:40.820
MATT: "Indeed."
MARISHA: Do you know how deep

896
00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.330
the ocean is?
TRAVIS: It's pretty fucking deep.

saying you want to date Fjord?

SAM: I don't think that's what he's saying.

909

MATT: "That isn't what I was saying."

910
00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.160
LAURA: I'm sorry, I was distracted by-- there's cookies.

911
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.140
SAM: Yeah, and also the ocean talk.

912
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.180
LAURA: Yeah, the ocean, dive deep into the ocean.

913
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.110
TRAVIS: It's a metaphor.
LIAM: Rip that open real fast.

TALIESIN: Rip it, rip it. Go for it.

915
00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:38.500
I believe in you.
LIAM: Get it.

916
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.333
TALIESIN: Yeah!

917
00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:40.726
(laughter)

918
00:39:40.726 --> 00:39:42.350

919
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.160
"To pursue beyond the limits of

920

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.210
"to do what every archmage before us has failed to do."

922
00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.460
LIAM: Anything is impossible.

923
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.880
You just have to look long enough and hard enough.

924
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.963
MATT: "Indeed."

925
00:40:04.963 --> 00:40:06.480
TALIESIN: The things we've seen.

926
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.720
LIAM: You don't strike me as having
much of an appetite for war.

927
00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.470
MATT: "No, I have an appetite for knowledge."

928
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.860
MARISHA: Going back to the ocean metaphor,

929
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.567
because it's kind of working.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

930
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.190
MARISHA: You could also get crushed into oblivion

931
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:30.960
by several tons of weight at the bottom of the ocean

932
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.226
or, you know, consumed by some other

933
00:40:35.226 --> 00:40:36.404

934
00:40:36.404 --> 00:40:38.440
LAURA and MARISHA: Uk'otoa.

935
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.980
MARISHA: Are you not remotely humbled or afraid

936
00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.930
of some of the unknowns you might find?

937
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.500
MATT: "I am as afraid as anybody is facing into the unknown,

938

"but that's what makes it worthwhile, is it not?"

939
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.865
LIAM: High risk, high reward.

940
00:40:55.865 --> 00:40:59.330
MATT: "Indeed. But you can mitigate the risk."

941
00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.273
TRAVIS: That's actually an interesting train of thought.
MARISHA: How?

942
00:41:01.273 --> 00:41:02.820
LAURA: How can you mitigate the risk?

943
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.350
TRAVIS: Investigating your Luxon and the Beacons,

944
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:09.030
has anyone ever, I don't know, died researching it

945
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.354
or perhaps gazed in it too deeply, I don't know.

946
00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:16.823
MATT: "There have been those who have not understood

947

"before they were ready to do so.

952

"And that is a lesson we all must learn from."

953
00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:38.170
MARISHA: Maybe the lesson is that it's way too much power

954
00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.800
for any one person to be fucking with.

955
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.642
MATT: "This is possible. But that's why you take care,

TRAVIS: Only because Jester loves the details,

958
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.850
what happened to those people that

959
00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:56.470
messed around with things sooner than they should have?

Is he?

978
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.473
Do I glean, has he made this?
TRAVIS: He killed his wife with a time machine!

979
00:42:59.473 --> 00:43:03.010
MARISHA: He's got some H.G. Wells shit kicking.

980

MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check.

981
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:06.630
MARISHA: Just going based off of his,

TRAVIS: Can I assist her in that?

983

TRAVIS: I assist her, I assist her.

987

MATT: I'd say both you guys, if you guys are both checking,

988
00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.330
it's both of your, this isn't a skill you necessarily

989
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.549
help somebody with for this particular instance.

990

TRAVIS: 16.

So, 15.
MATT: Mmkay.

1002
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.080
all this shit in it?
LAURA: So cool.

1003
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.000
SAM: He thinks of this shit and
then you get to read this shit.

1004
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.216
LIAM: Our canon is canon.
SAM: Yeah.

1005

ASHLEY: Yeah.

Okay.

1008
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:04.120
ASHLEY: What do you mean someone came back

1009
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.050
and then they returned to dust?

1010
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.356
That they came back and then just poof?

1011
00:44:11.356 --> 00:44:16.356
MATT: "This was an assisted ritual and when they returned,

1012
00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.760
"they turned to dust."
TRAVIS: Poof.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.834

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.840
MATT: "Oh, it was but a few moments."

1016
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.015
LAURA: Really?
LIAM: How long ago was this?

1017
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.420
MATT: "70 years."
LAURA: Whoa.

1018
00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.050
ASHLEY: How long, were you able to talk to them

1019
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.373
when they arrived?
MATT: "Oh, I wasn't present for this, but I heard about it."

1020
00:44:34.373 --> 00:44:35.665
LAURA: Hmm.
TRAVIS: Poof.

1021
00:44:35.665 --> 00:44:38.490
LIAM: And you've heard of two instances?

1022
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:39.323
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

1023
00:44:39.323 --> 00:44:41.610
LIAM: But you do not know the result of the other.

1024
00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.413
MATT: "No."

1025
00:44:43.413 --> 00:44:45.620
LIAM: Well, just because we don't know the end of the story

1026
00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.570
does not mean it didn't go on.

1027
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.120
MATT: "This is true."

1028
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.958
LAURA: We met a guy who kind of could control time.

1029
00:44:52.958 --> 00:44:54.820
TALIESIN: I was just thinking about that.

1030
00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.210
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we played in his festival fun house.

1031
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.020
MARISHA: Yeah, his Happy Fun Ball.
LAURA: Yes, Happy Fun Ball.

1032
00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.680
ASHLEY: But even if that person was gone for just a moment,

1033
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.100
that doesn't mean that they weren't

1034
00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.030
gone for a very long time.

1035
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:09.310
TRAVIS: True.
SAM: What was his name again?

1036
00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.707
LAURA: Halas.
MARISHA: Halas, yeah.

1037
00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:12.840
LAURA: Have you ever heard of him?

1038
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.640
MATT: "I have."
LAURA: You have?

1039
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.290
SAM: Was he the other guy, was he the other story?

1040
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.720
LAURA: Did you know he eats people or something?

1041
00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.900
He is like, really weird.

1042
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.130
MATT: "No, I just know of scattered records

1043
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.371
"from the previous age."

1044
00:45:24.371 --> 00:45:26.210
LAURA: He trapped a demon.

1045
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:28.480
It's still trapped in his Happy Fun Ball.

1046
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.168
MATT: "What is this Happy Fun Ball?"

1047
00:45:31.168 --> 00:45:34.350
SAM: It's a dimension that he made or at least used

1048
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.870
to create a space where he could experiment, draw--

1049
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:40.057
MATT: "How did you access this?"

1050
00:45:40.057 --> 00:45:41.240
TALIESIN: It's a weird little puzzle

1051
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.560
and you shift it around just right.

1052
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.456
SAM: It's two turns left and two turns right--

1053
00:45:45.456 --> 00:45:46.960
LAURA: And then all the sudden, you get sucked in

1054
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.900
and you can't get out unless--
MATT: "You have this right now?"

1055
00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:50.860
ALL: No.
SAM: I mean, come on.

1056
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.260
LIAM: We sort of lucked into it, actually.

1057
00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.188
We are not in possession of it anymore.

1058
00:45:56.188 --> 00:45:59.043
TRAVIS: It was called also the Archmage's--

1059
00:45:59.043 --> 00:46:00.140
TRAVIS, LAURA, and MARISHA: Bane.

1060
00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.769
TRAVIS: It was attracted to terminate magic practitioners

1061
00:46:03.769 --> 00:46:05.780
that wandered in.
MARISHA: It had a few names.

1062
00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.290
Nah, I'm not going to look at my notes.

1063
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:08.760
LAURA: Have you heard of that?

1064
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.620
MATT: "I have not."

1065
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.190
SAM: Is Halas the other story that you knew?

1066
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:13.480
MATT: "No, no.

1067
00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.160
"This was all dunamantic-based, within the Dynasty."

1068
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.110
TALIESIN: But the thing that happened--

1069
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:19.800
LAURA: Didn't know if his was too, maybe.

1070
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.680
TALIESIN: Was time moved at a different speed

1071
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.050
on the inside than on the outside

1072
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.280
and apparently it could change, if I recall?

1073
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.570
MARISHA: You couldn't really control it.

1074
00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:31.800
You could be in there for 80 years or eight minutes.

1075
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.860
LIAM: It was more changing the rate of passage.

1076
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.570
MATT: "Mm, that is dunamis-adjacent, though I do not know

1077
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.790
"if that is specifically, or perhaps an,

1078
00:46:43.225 --> 00:46:46.120
"a lack of a realization of what he was dabbling with."

1079
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.510
LAURA: Hey, Essek?
MATT: "Yes?"

1080
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:49.970
LAURA: How come all of a sudden

1081
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.590
you want to talk to us like we're friends?

1082
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:54.960
Not that I mind because I'm really happy that you're here,

1083
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.490
but did we do something cool or something

1084
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.842
that you like us all the sudden?

1085
00:46:58.842 --> 00:47:01.015
MATT: (clears throat)

1086
00:47:01.015 --> 00:47:03.252
He takes his wine, takes a big sip.

1087
00:47:03.252 --> 00:47:04.800
TRAVIS: Throw me a tea cracker-cookie thing.

1088
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.835
LAURA: Oh god, they're so good.

1089
00:47:05.835 --> 00:47:09.035
TRAVIS: Just Frisbee that bitch.

1090
00:47:09.035 --> 00:47:11.110
ASHLEY: Would you like a Frisbee cookie?

1091
00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:12.170
MATT: "I'm all right, thank you."

1092
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:17.170
MARISHA: I'll Frisbee that cookie.
TALIESIN: Do you want to toss one? Okay.

1093
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.909
LIAM: Toss my cookies.

1094
00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:21.326
(laughter)

1095
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:27.323
MATT: "The Dynasty, I've lived here my entire life,

1096
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:31.590
"and while there are benefits and there are other places

1097
00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.330
"that are much more challenging to live in,

1098
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:36.380
"I find it frustrating at times.

1099
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:43.090
"I find that the obsession with this Luxon entity

1100
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:48.150
"belies what the truth may be, that these artifacts,

1101
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:53.230
"I theorize, have nothing to do with a divine being

1102
00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:56.320
"but are just perhaps artifacts designed

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.570
"in the Age of Arcanum that have been misread.

1104
00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:02.620
"In which case, it is being misused

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:05.060
"or at least only the surface

1106
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.960
"has been scratched of what's possible.

1107
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:11.733
"So. My interests

1108
00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:16.800
"leave me not trusting anyone,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.208
"not feeling like I, in some ways, belong.

1110
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.800
"And as such, I spend a lot of my time in solitude."

1111
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.610
LIAM: Why trust us with your interests?

1112
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:29.090
MATT: (inhales)

1113
00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:30.860
"Because I'm thankful to have met you.

1114
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.460
"I don't have much in the way of friends,

00:48:40.081 --> 00:48:43.850

"you are adaptable, you're clever,

"to one flawed society or another.

"to survive in this cold, cruel world,

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.020
"as it's something I pride myself on.

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:04.998
"And...

"I don't know, I haven't felt a kinship with...

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:17.498
"anyone in a long time."

1126
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.298
LIAM: Is this friendship safe for you here?

1127
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.846
MATT: "Nothing I do is safe."

1128
00:49:25.846 --> 00:49:27.078
MARISHA: Fuck.

1129
00:49:27.078 --> 00:49:29.308
Fuck, I like him.

1130
00:49:29.308 --> 00:49:31.412
LAURA: You can go get in the hot tub.

1131
00:49:31.412 --> 00:49:32.695
MATT: "Ah--"

1132
00:49:34.595 --> 00:49:37.200
And he goes and takes some of the food off the plate and,

1133
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.629
"This is very good, Caduceus."

1134
00:49:40.629 --> 00:49:43.590
TRAVIS: We appreciate the trust, it means a lot.

1135
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:44.430
We move around

1136
00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:47.240
quite a bit ourselves.

1137
00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.520
You've been a rock for us and that's appreciated.

1138
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.943
MARISHA: Should I tell him secrets?

1139
00:49:51.943 --> 00:49:53.626
I feel like I should tell him secrets.
TRAVIS: Right now?

1140
00:49:53.626 --> 00:49:55.600
LAURA: We owe him some favors.

1141
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.050
MARISHA: Hey, yeah, let's do that first.

1142
00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.580
What do you mean by that?

1143
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.817
What favors?

1144
00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.140
MATT: "I don't know.

1145
00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.550
"Perhaps some of my research at some time

1146
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:09.438
"might require more hands than those I have myself."

1147
00:50:09.438 --> 00:50:10.920
TRAVIS: How many do you have?

1148
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.378
MATT: "Two."
TRAVIS: Oh.

1149
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.233
TALIESIN: We can get hands.

1150
00:50:15.233 --> 00:50:16.840
We kill a lot of people on occasion.

1151
00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.190
LAURA: Yeah, or we can use our own hands.

1152
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:22.290
TALIESIN: Oh, oh yeah, okay.
LAURA: Yeah.

1153
00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:23.620
TALIESIN: Still.

1154
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.900
MATT: "While we're asking questions,

1155
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.340
"you've asked a few questions of me,

1156
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.130
"I'll ask a few questions, and you can ask some more.

1157
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.500
"This is how conversation works, right?"

1158
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.201
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "I'm a little rusty."

1159
00:50:31.201 --> 00:50:32.585
SAM: Oh, wow.

1160
00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.030
I'm sorry.

1161
00:50:36.858 --> 00:50:38.379
LIAM: Yeah, I can relate.

1162
00:50:38.379 --> 00:50:41.493
ASHLEY: Do you ever get lonely in your solitude?

1163
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.293
MATT: "I didn't think so until recently."

1164
00:50:46.239 --> 00:50:47.756
ASHLEY: Hmm.

1165
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:50.712
MATT: "What about you?"

1166
00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.373
ASHLEY: Um,

1167
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:57.743
yes.

1168
00:50:59.303 --> 00:51:02.643
I think, if I'm answering honestly,

1169
00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.270
I think,

1170
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.511
but I think

1171
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.830
I almost became

1172
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:12.480
more lonely in my solitude

1173
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.360
after I became friends with all of them

1174
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:18.574
because I realized

1175
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:23.190
what having good friends feels like.

1176
00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.293
MATT: "Hmm."

1177
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.251
LAURA: Oh, you're going to be so sad if we leave

1178
00:51:32.251 --> 00:51:34.918
because you like us so much now.

1179
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.581
I'm drawing Essek.

1180
00:51:38.581 --> 00:51:40.681
MATT: "What--

1181
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.070
"what is it that you with to accomplish, Beauregard?"

1182
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:48.690
MARISHA: I'm doing pretty good.

1183
00:51:51.896 --> 00:51:53.728
I'm an Expositor now.

1184
00:51:53.728 --> 00:51:55.053
MATT: "Congratulations."

1185
00:51:55.053 --> 00:51:56.350
MARISHA: Thank you.

1186
00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:00.910
So, considering (takes deep breath) I wasn't sure

1187
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:03.220
if I was going to live past 19

1188
00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.390
or make it out of my hometown or amount to any

1189
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:11.450
remote decent person in society,

1190
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.640
I'm not really, I don't know if I'd say I'm a decent--

1191
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.373
I didn't know if I was going to amount to anything, so.

1192
00:52:16.373 --> 00:52:17.860
Feeling pretty fucking great.

1193
00:52:19.215 --> 00:52:22.540
MATT: "Feels nice sometimes to be the youngest while people

1194
00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.080
expect little of you and then to prove them wrong."

1195
00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:28.140
MARISHA: Yeah, the bar was pretty low.

1196
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.040
MATT: "Just hope you can maintain that

1197
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:36.820
"bar you raise to your own standards, not theirs."

1198
00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.020
MARISHA: Yeah, well, you always hold yourself

1199
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.073
to the highest of standards first, right?

1200
00:52:42.073 --> 00:52:44.171
MATT: "Ha. True.

1201
00:52:44.171 --> 00:52:45.546
"How about you, Fjord?"

1202
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.690
TRAVIS: What do I want?
MATT: "What do you want?"

1203
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:51.980
SAM: He's very religious.

1204
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:56.663
TRAVIS: No, I'm practicing faith.

1205
00:53:04.286 --> 00:53:06.119
I'm not actually sure.

1206
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:11.340
Whatever it was that I started out

1207
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.030
thinking was important to me seems,

1208
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:15.420
with time, to have faded into something else.

1209
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:23.530
I've been pulled into adventures and conflicts

1210
00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.530
with this wonderful group of people and

1211
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.290
I want to see them protected and kept.

1212
00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:34.460
It seems my

1213
00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.820
personal matters from before just have sort of

1214
00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.390
taken a back seat to the

1215
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:47.620
grander things on our stage these days.

1216
00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.453
MATT: "Hmm.

1217
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.065
"And you, Jester.

1218
00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.240
"What is it you are seeking?"

1219
00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.525
LAURA: What am <i>I</i> seeking?
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

1220
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:07.340
LAURA: Well, there's Traveler Con
coming up, so I'm seeking--

1221
00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:10.161
MATT: "I'm not familiar with that."
TRAVIS: He doesn't know what that is.

1222
00:54:10.161 --> 00:54:11.610
LAURA: Well--

1223
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.910
MARISHA: She's seeking a hotel room and--

1224
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:15.920
LAURA: I mean, yeah, we have to find,

1225
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.090
there's so many preparations we have to make.

1226
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:19.960
LIAM: Give him the elevator pitch.

1227
00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.120
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Canon.

1228
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.919
LAURA: Have you heard of the Traveler?

1229
00:54:24.919 --> 00:54:27.110
TRAVIS: Oh no.
MATT: "I have heard of it

1230
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:29.985
"in the context of your arrival."

1231
00:54:29.985 --> 00:54:30.943
LAURA: Oh.

1232
00:54:30.943 --> 00:54:34.543
(muffled laughter)

1233
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.020
LAURA: Well, the Traveler is a god

1234
00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:42.800
who, obviously, like, normally I wouldn't mention it

1235
00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.990
around people here because I don't want to get murdered

1236
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:47.990
because of, you know, but that's okay

1237
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:51.160
because sometimes, you know, if you're super into your god,

1238
00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:54.740
you're supposed to maybe get killed for them, I don't know.

1239
00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:55.980
I don't think the Traveler would want me

1240
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.380
to be killed for him, though, right now.

1241
00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.580
MARISHA: That's not--
LAURA: Anyway,

1242
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.480
the Traveler's really cool, he wears this green cloak,

1243
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.220
he's super powerful, he travels around, he's always with us.

1244
00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.220
He likes, you know, for you to do good things

1245
00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:13.020
and bad things, he likes for there to be a good balance.

1246
00:55:14.483 --> 00:55:17.940
If you feel like doing something funny, he's into it.

1247
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.590
LIAM: Bad things?
LAURA: What?

1248
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.720
SAM: Well, like, little bad things, not like <i>bad</i> things.

1249
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.530
LAURA: No, not like bad things-bad things.

1250
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:25.363
SAM: Tricky things.

1251
00:55:25.363 --> 00:55:28.280
LIAM: Like naughty things?
LAURA: Well yeah, but like,

1252
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.390
that's, you know, everybody shows their

1253
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:33.320
devotion to the Traveler differently.

1254
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.040
I'm sure maybe there's murderers out there or something

1255
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.700
that can be, you know, liking the Traveler

1256
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.860
but at the same time, if they murder people,

1257
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.130
then maybe they have to go and make a lot of babies.

1258
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:46.603
I don't know, you know, it's all about balance.

1259
00:55:46.603 --> 00:55:49.400
Maybe I'm presenting this wrong.

1260
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.320
What I'm saying is we're having a big convention

1261
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.150
for everybody that's super into him

1262
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:57.658
and we're going to get together
and that's happening in a month.

1263
00:55:57.658 --> 00:55:58.491
MATT: "Interesting."

1264
00:55:58.491 --> 00:55:59.700
MARISHA: It's never sounded more like a cult.

1265
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.640
It's never sounded more like a cult.

1266
00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.170
TALIESIN: It's a cult.
LAURA: It's not a cult!

1267
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:04.650
It's not a cult, it's not a cult.

1268
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.190
Because the thing is, here's the thing.

1269
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:09.630
If it's a cult, then it's not,

1270
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.810
you're not actually worshiping a god or something,

1271
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:13.130
you know, you're just worshiping a person

1272
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:14.730
that thinks they're religions

1273
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.997
or a god or something, but this guy really is a god.

1274
00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.769
So it's a religion.
TALIESIN: You have a point.

1275
00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:26.315
MATT: "Well, good luck."

1276
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.560
LAURA: Do you want to hear more about him?

1277
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.353
MATT: "I'm fine."

1278
00:56:32.911 --> 00:56:35.540
LAURA: I have, here, I'm going to get my brochure out.

1279
00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.040
Here, take it.

1280
00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.110
If you just want to read up sometime

1281
00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.330
or if you just, like, want to meditate with me

1282
00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:44.250
and talk, you know, then maybe we can discuss.

1283
00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:45.540
If you want to come to Traveler Con--

1284
00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:46.560
MATT: "Some good pictures in here."

1285
00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.620
TRAVIS: Do you want to tell him

1286
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.040
what happens at Traveler Con, perhaps?

1287
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.290
LAURA: We're going and it's going to be

1288
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:53.310
at the volcano and it's going to be super fun.

1289
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:54.960
We'll probably have some big speakers,

1290
00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.980
maybe a band play, I'm not sure.

1291
00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.860
We'll probably have, like, a party,

1292
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:03.080
a dance party, maybe, you know?

1293
00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.120
Maybe a costume contest, I'm not sure.

1294
00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.000
LIAM: Do you want to come to a volcano?

1295
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.540
LAURA: Do you want to go to a volcano?

1296
00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.495
MATT: "I'm all right."
LAURA: We have a ship.

1297
00:57:10.495 --> 00:57:11.845
SAM: Jessie?
LAURA: Hm?

1298
00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:14.741
SAM: Traveler Con, I'm a hundred percent down with

1299
00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:18.697
and I think it's great, but going to Traveler Con is not

1300
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.100
what you seek, is it?

1301
00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:22.933
LAURA: Well,

1302
00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.140
no,

1303
00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.560
but

1304
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.120
well, I mean, ultimately,

1305
00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.750
you know,

1306
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:34.820
I'm just trying to find,

1307
00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.857
you know, like, where I fit in in the world,

1308
00:57:41.582 --> 00:57:43.123
ultimately.

1309
00:57:43.123 --> 00:57:44.314
MATT: "That is a very,

1310
00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:47.750
"a very noble mortal cause."

1311
00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:53.950
MARISHA: Also, how many babies makes up for a murder?

1312
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:54.960
LAURA: You know, maybe one.

1313
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.860
You take one, you give one, I'm not sure.

1314
00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.925
MARISHA: Give a penny, take a penny, got it.

1315
00:57:58.925 --> 00:57:59.970
LAURA: I'm not sure, you know?

1316
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:02.140
I haven't actually talked to the Traveler about that

1317
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.990
because I don't, you know, murder people on a regular basis,

1318
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:07.260
but he did give me healing powers because,

1319
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.590
you know, maybe because we're out

1320
00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.020
doing these kind of things, you know?

1321
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.540
We fight people so maybe that's why I can heal people.

1322
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.200
LIAM: What is the worst thing you've ever done?

1323
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.128
As far as bad things go.

1324
00:58:18.126 --> 00:58:21.710
LAURA: Oh, well I stuck an axe in a dude's head one time.

1325
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:23.450
LIAM: Yeah, I watched you do it.

1326
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:25.150
LAURA: Yeah, that one was pretty fucked up.

1327
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:28.450
MARISHA: But that was badass and totally justified.

1328
00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:31.010
LAURA: I mean, he was going to potentially kill us.

1329
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:32.590
MARISHA: Yeah.

1330
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:34.952
LAURA: I was just defending.

1331
00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.503
MARISHA: What about you, Essek?

1332
00:58:38.503 --> 00:58:40.719
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

1333
00:58:40.719 --> 00:58:44.502
MATT: (chuckles) (sighs)

1334
00:58:44.502 --> 00:58:45.885
"I would say...

1335
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:55.390
"anger my father to a point where he

1336
00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.580
"went unprepared into the depths of

1337
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.397
"Bazzoxan and didn't return."

1338
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:07.090
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry.
MARISHA: All right, that's--

1339
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:08.450
LAURA: What'd you do to make him so mad?

1340
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:10.040
MARISHA: That's a lot to unpack.

1341
00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.490
And why do you think you're responsible for that?

1342
00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:16.430
Like, even before you tell us what you did,

1343
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:17.700
why do you think you're responsible for

1344
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:20.000
your dad not returning?

1345
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.360
MATT: "It's complicated.

1346
00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.870
"When I say bad in the sense of what is

1347
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:27.540
"largely assumed to be considered a bad thing.

1348
00:59:28.466 --> 00:59:30.180
"It doesn't bother me, necessarily.

1349
00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.593
"He wasn't a great man.

1350
00:59:33.497 --> 00:59:37.040
"He had little aspirations."

1351
00:59:39.266 --> 00:59:41.950
TRAVIS: Do you mind if I ask if is

1352
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:44.600
Bazzoxan near a beacon?

1353
00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:50.140
MATT: "Yes, and there is an
opportunity that he will return."

1354
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:55.377
TRAVIS: Just wanted to check.

1355
00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.600
TALIESIN: That's got to be odd, raising your parents.

1356
01:00:00.903 --> 01:00:02.120
MATT: (chuckling)

1357
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:02.953
LAURA: Oh, weird.

1358
01:00:02.953 --> 01:00:05.241
TALIESIN: Yeah, the more you think about it.

1359
01:00:05.241 --> 01:00:06.730
TRAVIS: Did you say raising your parents?

1360
01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.000
SAM: Well, if he comes back as a kid.

1361
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.980
LAURA: And you know he's your dad but he's also five.

1362
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.780
TRAVIS: Nope, not going there.

1363
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.660
LIAM: It has to have happened.

1364
01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.520
MATT: "Oh, numerous times.

1365
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:21.310
"Not to me yet and I'm

1366
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.250
"curious to see what that would

1367
01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:29.420
"be like when or if he returns."

1368
01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.880
LAURA: When somebody dies and they're in love

1369
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.420
with somebody else and then that person gets

1370
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.140
really old and it's like a 200 year old person, right?

1371
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.170
And then the other person realizes when they were, like,

1372
01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:46.970
15 that, that like, "Oh my god, I loved this person."

1373
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:51.660
Do they marry the person when they're adolescent

1374
01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.200
or does it not transfer that sort of emotional feeling?

1375
01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.370
Like, when you're star-crossed lovers

1376
01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.250
for all time or do you, like--

1377
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.620
TRAVIS: Reset.
LAURA: Yeah.

1378
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.480
MATT: "It-- ah. These are not matters

1379
01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.590
"I've conjectured too often, but there are individuals

1380
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:12.480
"that have relationships that span multiple lifetimes."

1381
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.400
LAURA: Whoa.
MATT: "There are those that,

1382
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.360
"over lifetimes, feelings change,

1383
01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.560
"as the heart itself, for some, does evolve and wander.

1384
01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.140
"For others, it is held straight and narrow."

1385
01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.433
ASHLEY: How long--
LIAM: The 700 year itch.

1386
01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:28.763
(laughter)

1387
01:01:28.763 --> 01:01:31.590
ASHLEY: I'm still figuring a lot of this out.

1388
01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:33.500
MATT: "I understand, it's a lot to take in." (chuckles)

1389
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.710
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LIAM: Terrible.

1390
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:40.710
ASHLEY: So can a person still be dead for a very long time

1391
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:45.780
for them to come back into another body, or does it happen

1392
01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:50.802
(snaps) instantly?
MATT: "As far as I understand it, it's fairly quick."

1393
01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:52.420
ASHLEY: Oh.
MATT: "I mean, as long as

1394
01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:56.160
"it happens in a place where people are being born.

1395
01:01:58.056 --> 01:02:00.050
"I think, theoretically, if a Luxon

1396
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:04.910
"were to be in the presence of, let's say, theoretically,

1397
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:08.890
"thousands of deaths and yet, no children are born,

1398
01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.240
"they would just be waiting.

1399
01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.910
"But then with each progressive birth

1400
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:16.060
"within the radius of the Luxon,

1401
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:20.760
"those souls would then be transferred with each new child."

1402
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.490
LAURA: So, if one of the beacons got

1403
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.800
stolen with a bunch of souls,

1404
01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.973
or does it--

1405
01:02:27.973 --> 01:02:29.600
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1406
01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.950
LAURA: But it would just let out

1407
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.400
the souls as it traveled, right?

1408
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.380
TRAVIS: But only to those that have been consecuted.

1409
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.440
MATT: "Well, the souls that've been captured are the ones

1410
01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.720
"that are consecuted."
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

1411
01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.880
MATT: "If you were to travel with the beacon, in theory,

1412
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.820
"then they would disperse as children

1413
01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.390
"were born within that radius."

1414
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:49.035
TRAVIS and LAURA: Whoa.

1415
01:02:49.035 --> 01:02:50.170
LIAM: Like a fog bomb.

1416
01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:52.453
TRAVIS: That is overreaching.

1417
01:02:52.453 --> 01:02:54.030
MARISHA: Do the other Beacons

1418
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.510
share a pocket universe, are they all connected?

1419
01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:01.840
Or you jettison into

1420
01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.967
a specific beacon?

1421
01:03:02.967 --> 01:03:05.080
TRAVIS: Or is that part of your research?

1422
01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.110
MATT: "That is part of what I'm curious about,

1423
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:09.860
"but such beacons are heavily guarded

1424
01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.280
"and are assigned to certain individuals,

1425
01:03:14.921 --> 01:03:18.840
"for the interests of the religion, to keep."

1426
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.710
LIAM: Is there any knowledge of the

1427
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:23.190
in between, any recollection?

1428
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.730
MATT: "None that have been recorded."

1429
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.480
TRAVIS: Whoa.
MARISHA: Just off in there.

1430
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.870
TRAVIS: How often are you able to interact with a beacon?

1431
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:36.190
Like, you, beacon, study hall.

1432
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:37.050
MATT: "Not often.

1433
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:41.990
"There is a lot of importance in having them

1434
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:46.990
"specifically located and kept safe within approved areas

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.240
"of Xhorhas to ensure that the masses of the population

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.870
"are usually within the radius of one."

1437
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:57.070
MARISHA: Have you ever stared at one for about a minute?

1438
01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.520
MATT: "If you're referring as to whether or not I have

1439
01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.430
"attuned with it for a moment, numerous times, yes."

1440
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:05.510
LIAM: Of course.

1441
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:07.930
MARISHA: I'll trade you a secret if it

1442
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:10.597
crosses off one of those favors.

1443
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.680
MATT: "It better be one heck of a secret."

1444
01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.130
MARISHA: Done some research on the Luxons.

1445
01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:24.060
Beacons, the Luxons, are those the same thing?

1446
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.630
MATT: The Luxon beacons.

1447
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:27.455
MARISHA: I've done some research on the Luxon beaxons.

1448
01:04:27.455 --> 01:04:29.143
Beacons.

1449
01:04:29.143 --> 01:04:31.476
TALIESIN: (beatboxing) Luxon beaxons, Luxon beaxons.
MARISHA: Snea snake.

1450
01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:34.134
(laughter)

1451
01:04:34.134 --> 01:04:36.400
LAURA: You sound very knowledgeable
about them, so this'll be--

1452
01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.391
MARISHA: We've had, like, two bottles of wine, okay?

1453
01:04:40.391 --> 01:04:42.500
With tossing, tossing maple cookies.

1454
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:47.500
LAURA: They're really good.
LIAM: They are very good. Sweet.

1455
01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:50.777
MARISHA: The Empire found another one.

1456
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.040
They uncovered it in the archeological

1457
01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.960
dig site of Pride's Call, where they found

1458
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.860
a lot of arcane weapons

1459
01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:07.401
from the

1460
01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.147
pre-Calamity stuff.

1461
01:05:12.147 --> 01:05:13.500
(laughter)

1462
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.750
LAURA: Secret secrets.
LIAM: Checks out.

1463
01:05:18.104 --> 01:05:20.950
MARISHA: No, that's my notes.
TALIESIN: Over 1.5.

1464
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.050
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

1465
01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.090
MARISHA: From the Age of Arcanum, right?

1466
01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:28.260
That's what I was looking for.

1467
01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.430
MATT: "I ask you this: what are your

1468
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:33.510
"opinions on war, on this conflict?"

1469
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:36.250
TRAVIS: What is it good for?
SAM: Nothing, that's what.

1470
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.685
LIAM: Huh.
TALIESIN: Say it again.

1471
01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:40.685
(wheezing laughter)

1472
01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.420
TRAVIS: That was so fast.
MARISHA: It was.

1473
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.543
LIAM: It was traveled.
MATT: Wow.

1474
01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.571
(laughter)

1475
01:05:48.571 --> 01:05:50.701
LIAM: I mean, that, basically, that's our stance, right?

1476
01:05:50.701 --> 01:05:51.534
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

1477
01:05:51.534 --> 01:05:55.630
MATT: "If you truly intend on maintaining this peace,

1478
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:57.340
"of seeing this negotiation through

1479
01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.610
"and find that this conflict gives

"no benefit to you and your interests,

"it would do well to not let that

"information find its way to the Bright Queen."

1483
01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.680
MARISHA: Don't tell her about that?

1484
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.603
You don't want to tell her about that?
SAM: Why? Why?

1485
01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:15.028
TRAVIS: I think it might tip the scales.

1486
01:06:15.028 --> 01:06:16.086
MATT: "Because then there would be

1487
01:06:16.086 --> 01:06:18.340

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:34.000
SAM: And you care more about stopping

1493
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.113
this war than serving your Queen?

1494
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:41.680
MATT: "The Dynasty is where I live.

MARISHA: Well.
TRAVIS: We're not being watched, right?

1504
01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:07.420
We don't have a little floating ball--

1505
01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.883
MARISHA: Yeah, have we been watched since we've been here?

LAURA: Whoa.
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

1510
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:19.370
If we've been watched, this is bad.

1511
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:20.850
LAURA: Of course we're being watched.

1512
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.750

MARISHA: Oh, shoot.

1513
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:25.810
MATT: Mmkay.
SAM: See, we're fine.

1514
01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:27.760
MATT: You do glance around and you see

1515
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.560
nothing of the sort in the vicinity.

1516
01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.740
MARISHA: Does the Dynasty have us bugged in this house?

they, at times, chimed in.

Did you ever watch us?
TRAVIS: To be specific,

1523
01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.390
we've seen ourselves being watched.

1524
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:53.473
We were hoping it was you?

1525
01:07:53.473 --> 01:07:55.273

LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh.

1527

Did you see us when we were changing clothes?

Were you watching us when we were naked?

01:08:14.233 --> 01:08:18.370
"any chances of undue Empire business

1533
01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:21.290
"finding its way within the proximity of the Bastion."

1534
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:23.870
LAURA: Makes sense.
MARISHA: If you chimed in

1535
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:25.780
when we were changing, would you have kept watching

1536
01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.340
or would you have checked out?

1537
01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:28.440
MATT: "I am more respectful than that

1538
01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.890
"and have no interest in such things.

1539
01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:30.780
"Why?"
ASHLEY: Is there one of us

1540
01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.716
that you would've watched longer than--

1541
01:08:32.716 --> 01:08:34.990
TRAVIS: Wow.
TALIESIN: Wait, okay.

1542
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:37.073
SAM: And which one? You can be open here.

1543
01:08:37.073 --> 01:08:38.241
MATT: "So."

1544
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:39.916
(laughter)

1545
01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:42.430
TRAVIS: How much has he had to drink?

1546
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:46.460
MATT: "This additional beacon, where is it now?"

1547
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:51.170
SAM: We'll tell you if you tell us
which one of us is the hottest.

1548
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:53.613
LAURA: Zone of Truth. (laughs)

1549
01:08:53.613 --> 01:08:58.605
(laughter)

1550
01:09:00.192 --> 01:09:01.442
LIAM: Ohmigosh, you guys.

1551
01:09:01.442 --> 01:09:03.529
Do you want to play seven minutes in the Zone of Truth?

1552
01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:06.030
(laughter)

1553
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:08.101
LIAM: (imitates bottle spinning)

1554
01:09:08.101 --> 01:09:10.659
MATT: Epic fantasy, heroic personalities,

1555
01:09:10.659 --> 01:09:12.183
fighting against the dangers of the world

1556
01:09:12.183 --> 01:09:14.670
to rise the ranks of power and glory to--

1557
01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:15.960
LAURA: Who do you like?
MATT: Find out

1558
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.510
who wants to make out with somebody else!

1559
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:20.060
This is Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

1560
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.765
(laughter)

1561
01:09:21.765 --> 01:09:24.344
LIAM: Don't kid yourselves, that's why we're here.

1562
01:09:24.344 --> 01:09:25.869
(laughter)

1563
01:09:25.869 --> 01:09:27.890
TALIESIN: Yeah, we don't, we don't know where it is.

1564
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:28.723
We've just--

1565
01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:32.060
SAM: Well, we know where it came from.

1566
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:37.060
MARISHA: I can tell you it's the one they plan to give back,

1567
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:41.330
which I find deeply problematic and have since they

1568
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:47.230
poised that plan because I'm assuming as soon as

1569
01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:50.500
the Bright Queen takes one look at it--

1570
01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.030
SAM: Yeah, it's not like a dead goldfish

1571
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:53.670
where you can just, like, swap out another one

1572
01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:55.440
and be like, "Here's your goldfish."

1573
01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.600
Like, she'll know that it's not the same goldfish.

1574
01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.433
LAURA: Will she?

1575
01:10:00.284 --> 01:10:01.609
MATT: "Well, it depends.

1576
01:10:01.609 --> 01:10:03.700
"If they're handing over this new one they've found

1577
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.400
"or if they're returning the one that was taken

1578
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.700
"and then planned to keep this new one for themselves."

1579
01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.400
LAURA: I mean, there's no way to
really know which one is which.

1580
01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.530
LIAM: What you're saying, though, is any one of them,

1581
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:16.020
even this one that has been found,

1582
01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:19.330
dug up within the Empire's reaches,

1583
01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:22.840
would be considered the property of the Dynasty.

1584
01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:27.140
MATT: "By their divine right to own these artifacts that

1585
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.337
"extend their ability to maintain the cycle of life, yes."

1586
01:10:31.337 --> 01:10:34.027
LAURA: What if these things are all over the world, though?

1587
01:10:34.027 --> 01:10:35.210
MATT: "I believe they are.

1588
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:37.240
"That is the assumption."

1589
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.290
LIAM: And you're telling us you would

1590
01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:42.040
prefer to keep this a secret in this room?

1591
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:46.820
MATT: "I am advising, based on your proclivity

1592
01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:49.320
"to not continue this conflict

1593
01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.480
"and the lengths at which you've gone

1594
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.780
"to prevent this war from spreading further and further,

1595
01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.880
"putting yourselves in harm's way to do so,

1596
01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:01.220
"that if that is what you continually wish to do,

1597
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.140
"to not notify the Bright Queen

1598
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.618
"or any other members of the council around her of this."

1599
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:13.555
TALIESIN: Would it be advisable

1600
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.675
for us to urge--

1601
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:20.100
MARISHA: The Empire to give back--
TALIESIN: The Empire to give back

1602
01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:24.850
either the correct one or honestly, both?

1603
01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:28.730
SAM: Or steal it back.

1604
01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:31.660
TALIESIN: I don't think that would accomplish what we're,

1605
01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:34.722
that would just be us plundering them,

1606
01:11:34.722 --> 01:11:36.713
they would have no reason to stop.

1607
01:11:36.713 --> 01:11:38.190
SAM: It's really shiny, though.
MATT: "Well,

1608
01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:40.498
"is it in the hands of

1609
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:43.900
"the Empire--"
SAM: Cerberus Assembly.

1610
01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.420
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: "Of the Assembly?"

1611
01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.760
LIAM: At the top.
MATT: "That both makes sense

1612
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.210
"and confirms that you should not

1613
01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:50.940
"attempt to take it from them."

1614
01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.220
TALIESIN: That's what I thought.

1615
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.210
MARISHA: Plus, if we take it from them,

1616
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.625
they're just going to blame it on the Kryn.

1617
01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:58.200
TALIESIN: Start the war more.

1618
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.120
LIAM: You know about these things.

1619
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.948
What could they do with it to abuse its powers?

1620
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:10.400
MATT: "Well, they have some powerful minds in the Assembly."

1621
01:12:11.308 --> 01:12:12.730
(liquid sloshing)

1622
01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:14.430
MATT: "Or if they are somewhat dubious,

1623
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:18.569
"so does anyone of true intelligence and capability.

1624
01:12:18.569 --> 01:12:21.525
"(chuckling)

1625
01:12:21.525 --> 01:12:24.475
"If your necessary choices are moral choices and

1626
01:12:27.979 --> 01:12:29.329
"in my experience, I'd trust

1627

"they would have similar interests

1628
01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.840
"of seeing what it's capable of.

1629
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.632
"Perhaps they can be reasoned with and perhaps...

1630
01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.363
"I will think on this."

1631
01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.660
TALIESIN: I don't know if-- I'm not sure if the Empire

1632
01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:55.500
even knows that they're giving the wrong one.

1633
01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.670
I don't think they talk to each other enough.

1634
01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.030
I think there may be secrets within secrets.

1635
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:01.900
MARISHA: Oh, there's definitely secrets within secrets.

1636
01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.250
It's just a matter of who knows--

1637
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:05.720
LIAM: Just like here.
TALIESIN: Too many people not lying,

1638
01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.470
too many people telling the truth,

1639
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:08.990
then all the truths conflict.

1640
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:10.700
MATT: "Do you have--"
MARISHA: Someone will know.

1641
01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.926
MATT: "--a relationship with the Assembly?"

1642
01:13:12.926 --> 01:13:13.759
(groaning)

1643
01:13:13.759 --> 01:13:16.390
SAM: Some of them.
LIAM: Somewhat.

1644
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:17.610
LIAM: Our sense is--

1645
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:23.260
and I'm sure that you all have guessed this yourselves,

1646
01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:27.130
but the Assembly has its plans separate from the King.

1647
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:30.277
MATT: "I would assume.

1648
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.133
"Hm.

1649
01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:37.980
"Well, if they have it,

1650
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.190
"at this moment, I cannot see a path to its retrieval

1651
01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:45.270
"nor any true benefit in attempting

1652
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:47.470
"to blow things up, if you will."

1653
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:51.940
MARISHA: Man, I am so glad I talked to you about this first.

1654
01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.310
LAURA: That woulda been super bad if

1655
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:55.180
you'd have just brought that up, woof.

1656
01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.270
MARISHA: Yup.
TALIESIN: I'm really proud of you,

1657
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:58.062
actually, that was really good.

1658
01:13:58.062 --> 01:13:59.380
That was another, that was a good move.

1659
01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.930
TRAVIS: There has to be something
about this new Beacon, right?

1660
01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:04.680
There has to be a reason why they are even offering it up.

1661
01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.610
It has to be different from the first one.

1662
01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:08.520
LIAM: As long as we have been so

1663
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.650
forthright with you already, we

1664
01:14:12.641 --> 01:14:15.230
are very skeptical of the intentions

1665
01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:16.830
of the Assembly in this meeting.

1666
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.000
We are expecting fuckery.

1667
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.132
MATT: "As you should."

1668
01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.180
LIAM: We would like to pull the rug out from under them.

1669
01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.033
Not to topple the Empire but

1670
01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:41.100
maybe to clear the rot a bit from our nation.

1671
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:45.130
MATT: "And you believe that the individuals

1672
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:49.490
"that make the laws and employ them across your empire

1673
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.050
"are more capable than these mages?

1674
01:14:54.481 --> 01:14:57.580
"Do you not think there is perhaps a necessary balance

1675
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.032
"between the two that maintains the order?"

1676
01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.370
LIAM: No.
MARISHA: It's the dance

1677
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:08.750
the Cobalt Soul and the Cerberus Assembly have been in

1678
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:11.230
for hundreds of years now at this point.

1679
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:13.624
MATT: "Understand, the Assembly,

1680
01:15:13.624 --> 01:15:17.929
"and individuals of which I have no sum of,

1681
01:15:17.929 --> 01:15:22.525
"seem to be dangerous and calculating,

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.930
"but anyone of such extended study and pursuits,

1683
01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:32.290
"I can understand far better and see eye to eye with

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.770
"than I can a power hungry monarch

01:15:34.770 --> 01:15:38.513
"who came into their seat through bloodline."

1686
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:44.690
LIAM: I get the sense that they feel they have found

1687
01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:47.220
the upper hand somehow.
MATT: "Well."

1688
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:50.150
LIAM: I want to see the conflict end

1689
01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:53.034
and I do not get that sense from them.

1690
01:15:53.034 --> 01:15:57.950
(gentle music)

1691
01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.800
MATT: "What is the biggest danger to

1692
01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:08.074
"secret research?"

1693
01:16:08.074 --> 01:16:12.632
(gentle music)

1694
01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.960
TRAVIS: People finding out what you're researching

1695
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.210
or what you're--
TALIESIN: Discovery.

1696
01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:18.510
MATT: "Discovery.

"that pries into what you're doing?"

01:16:33.541 --> 01:16:34.374
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1701
01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.570
MARISHA: He's got a point.

1702
01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.540
LIAM: You are suggesting that they want to

1703
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.942
keep their extra.
MATT: "It could be.

1704
01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:53.350
"Or they intend to trap whatever it is they're delivering

1705
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:54.958
"and gain an upper hand.

1706
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:58.747
"Or something else.

1707
01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.352
"I'm but one mind, they are many."

1708
01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:05.390
TRAVIS: It's likely something else.

1709
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:07.940
SAM: We know they can extract things from the Beacons.

1710
01:17:09.977 --> 01:17:10.810
LAURA: Yeah.

1711
01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.940
SAM: Like energy or liquid or something.

1712
01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.740
LAURA: Yeah, they made potions out of it.

1713
01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.413
MATT: "Really.

1714
01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.720
"And where did you see this?"

1715
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.952
LAURA: When we found the-- when we
were in the Empire, we saw it.

1716
01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.500
We found a place that they had been doing

1717
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.650
some of their research and there was, like,

1718
01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.788
potions there.
MATT: "Hm.

1719
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.823
"Well.

1720
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:43.730
"If you have any means of discovering

1721
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:45.570
"more of such experiments that they're

1722
01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:49.000
"doing in their private chambers,

1723
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.760
"that would be of definite interest to me."

1724
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:57.670
MARISHA: What if they're willing to give it back

1725
01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:00.420
because it's not the one that they found that was empty?

1726
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:05.220
Because Nott looked at it and she got a signal.

1727
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.770
What if they drained the other one that they stole?

1728
01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.260
MATT: "That would be an astronomical feat based on

1729
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:16.520
"the sheer volume of power within each of these Beacons."

1730
01:18:18.043 --> 01:18:21.270
TALIESIN: That buried one was just
sitting there, not absorbing.

1731
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:22.720
LAURA: Maybe it was absorbing.

1732
01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.690
TRAVIS: The potential lives in a beacon,

1733
01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:26.680
thousands, hundreds,

1734
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.863
millions?

1735
01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.740
MATT: "It would have to depend on who was

1736
01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.360
"consecuted and passed in its presence.

1737
01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.270
"I have no idea."
LAURA: What does the ritual entail?

1738
01:18:41.731 --> 01:18:43.737
SAM: They cut the foreskin off?

1739
01:18:45.643 --> 01:18:46.476
LAURA: Mm.

1740
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:53.550
MATT: "You are guided by an Umavi
through a soul binding process.

1741
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:58.950
"It is extensive, it entails a bunch of spoken rites.

1742
01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:03.000
"It is usually observed by many individuals

1743
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.260
"of various dens, especially if you belong to one.

1744
01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.700
"And often when you are consecuted,

1745
01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.567
"you are given a path to a den."

1746
01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:13.783
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: "The families are expensive."

1747
01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:20.380
MARISHA: I got a question.
MATT: Mm-hmm?

1748
01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.530
MARISHA: In my research, would I have found anything

1749
01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:26.710
about Pride's Call that talks about them

1750
01:19:28.936 --> 01:19:32.370
having some form of reincarnation

1751
01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:36.170
as part of their culture or city--

1752
01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:38.580
MATT: Pride's Call?
MARISHA: With the dwarven society.

1753
01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.830
Yeah.
MATT: Nothing like that, actually.

1754
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:43.890
MARISHA: Nothing that sounds like--
MATT: Mm-mm.

1755
01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:45.320
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Repackaging--

1756
01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.860
SAM: Hypothetically, if we had one of these potions

1757
01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:49.280
that they had derived from the Beacon,

1758
01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.750
what would you do with it?

1759
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.450
MATT: (as Essek) "I would study it, top to bottom."

1760
01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.620
SAM: What could it tell you?
MATT: "I have no idea.

1761
01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:58.420
"That would be the purpose of researching it.

1762
01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:01.920
"Why, do you have one such thing?"

1763
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.420
SAM: I mean--
LIAM: Let's call this one favor--

1764
01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:07.940
TALIESIN: Whoa.
LIAM: Taken care of.

1765
01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:09.380
LIAM: You fucking drop a thing on the

1766
01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.560
Dynasty every time.
MATT: "That

1767
01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.020
"would be a favor accepted."
LAURA: Oh,

1768
01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:18.140
he didn't accept your secret.
MATT: Do you release it?

1769
01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:18.973
LIAM: Mm.
MATT: Mm.

1770
01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.350
TRAVIS: Wow.
MARISHA: Secrets are very valuable.

1771
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:25.090
SAM: We're giving them up like candy here.

1772
01:20:25.090 --> 01:20:26.350
LAURA: All you got to do is be nice to us.

1773
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:28.030
We don't have enough people being nice to us.

1774
01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:29.250
TALIESIN: I have plenty of people being

1775
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.240
nice to me.
MARISHA: She's got a point

1776
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.054
TRAVIS: And the SWAT team bursts in through the windows

1777
01:20:33.054 --> 01:20:34.030
MARISHA: (chuckles)

1778
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.863
Fuck!

1779
01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.085
MATT: He just sets it aside on the table.

1780
01:20:36.085 --> 01:20:37.190
(laughter)

1781
01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:38.690
MATT: "I can commiserate with that.

1782
01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:44.370
"Honestly, part of the reason I accepted your invitation

1783
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:46.220
"was after thinking and realizing that

1784
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:49.910
"perhaps it's been awhile since

1785
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:52.110
"somebody's extended such niceties to myself.

1786
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.690
"There are (sighs) elements to a solitary life

1787
01:20:58.690 --> 01:21:01.470
"that sometimes can be more challenging

1788
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:03.270
"once you have a basis of comparison."

1789
01:21:04.451 --> 01:21:05.810
MARISHA: The whole returning a favor thing

1790
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:08.040
is kind of a bit in jest.

1791
01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.360
In all honesty, we do deeply appreciate

1792
01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.650
all the things that you've done for us

1793
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.000
over these past several months.

1794
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.460
LAURA: Yeah, if you ever feel like ditching out here

1795
01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.913
and traveling with us, just let us know, you know?

1796
01:21:17.913 --> 01:21:18.746
(Essek chuckling)

1797
01:21:18.746 --> 01:21:20.740
SAM: Yeah, well no, she's not joking.

1798
01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.370
I mean, you know, you said, you said an important part

1799
01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:28.290
of what you do is staying alone and I think

1800
01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:30.290
we all felt that too before we met each other.

1801
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:32.410
LAURA: It's true.
TALIESIN: Literally.

1802
01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:33.680
LAURA: Very lonely, all of us.

1803
01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:35.853
MATT: "Well,

1804
01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.660
"if I can be of help in some way,

1805
01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.300
"perhaps with your predicament as you were requesting--"

1806
01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.490
SAM: Well, I--
MATT: "--let me know."

1807
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:49.920
SAM: There was a woman, a mage,

1808
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.300
who helped them turn me into this.

1809
01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.763
I don't really know anything about her, though.

1810
01:21:55.763 --> 01:21:57.375
LAURA: What was her name?
SAM: I don't know.

1811
01:21:57.375 --> 01:22:00.630
LAURA: What'd she look like?
SAM: A lady.

1812
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.705
LAURA: Like, what color was her hair?

1813
01:22:02.705 --> 01:22:06.260
SAM: I don't know, I was, like, mostly dead when I saw her.

1814
01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.320
MATT: "You, Caleb--"
LAURA: Was she ugly?

1815
01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.860
Was she pretty?
SAM: I mean,

1816
01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.920
not as pretty as you, but she was pretty.

1817
01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.770
MATT: "Your specialty in the arcane

1818
01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:14.770
"lies in the realm of transmutation, yes?"

1819
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:17.400
LIAM: Primarily.

1820
01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:23.100
Although, I, similar to you, I'm an avid reader.

1821
01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:27.340
I'm very curious about everything, everything.

1822
01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:29.790
SAM: He's been studying something to help me lately.

1823
01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.657
Working on equations.
LIAM: Yeah.

1824
01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:35.280
I've been noodling about with something.

1825
01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:37.800
MATT: "Perhaps I can offer some aid."

1826
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:41.810
LIAM: Then we would be willing to accept that.

1827
01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.250
I think we have a full plate for the next couple of days,

1828
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:49.740
but hopefully it will be wrapped up safely.

1829
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.370
LAURA: You just show him now, you just show him now.

1830
01:22:51.370 --> 01:22:52.580
SAM: Well, he's a little drunk.

1831
01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:54.970
He might not be able to--
LAURA: Oh, right.

1832
01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.320
SAM: Maybe we could get into the hot tub

1833
01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.980
and sorta look through the pages.

1834
01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.730
TRAVIS: That makes the drunk worse.
SAM: Does it?

1835
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:00.700
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: Getting in the hot tub?

1836
01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.047
SAM: Then let's do it!

1837
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.076
MARISHA: I'm game.

1838
01:23:05.076 --> 01:23:06.284
LAURA: Come get in the hot tub.
MATT: "You seriously

1839
01:23:06.284 --> 01:23:07.450
"have a hot tub?"
LAURA: We really, really do.

1840
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:09.238
I mean, do you want to see it?

1841
01:23:09.238 --> 01:23:10.110
SAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: It's very nice.

1842
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:13.410
LAURA: It is really great, you will like it.

1843
01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:14.930
MARISHA: Like a bricked-in hole in the ground

1844
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:16.970
that we heated with our magic

1845
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:18.830
LAURA: Or with fire.

1846
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:20.743
MATT: "I'm certainly curious."

1847
01:23:20.743 --> 01:23:22.012
LAURA: (claps) He's doing it!

1848
01:23:22.954 --> 01:23:24.054
He's doing it.
SAM: Let's do it!

1849
01:23:24.054 --> 01:23:25.340
TALIESIN: We've worked very hard on that hot tub.

1850
01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.540
MARISHA: You're right, I'm sorry--
TALIESIN: It's very nice.

1851
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.440
MARISHA: I'm not trying to minimize it.
TALIESIN: Don't minimize it.

1852
01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.273
It's spectacular.
MARISHA: I'm not.

1853
01:23:29.273 --> 01:23:30.140
It's a great hot tub.
LAURA: Yeah.

1854
01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.830
And it's got a good view, you see up into the trees.

1855
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:33.470
TALIESIN: The tree roots, like, the way that they've

1856
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:35.250
been expertly carved--
LAURA: It's true, beautiful.

1857
01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:38.310
SAM: Do you want to borrow some knickers or something?

1858
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:41.610
LAURA: You want to go naked?
MATT: "I just wanted to see it."

1859
01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:44.474
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: You want to get in.

1860
01:23:44.474 --> 01:23:45.340
(laughter)

1861
01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:46.511
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1862
01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:49.128
(laughter)

1863
01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.410
LIAM: Do it.
TALIESIN: Peer pressure.

1864
01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:52.243
LAURA: 15.

1865
01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.440
MATT: "A small dip, maybe."
SAM: Ooh.

1866
01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.320
Like, put your feet in.
MARISHA: He's a feet dangler, yeah.

1867
01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.034
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: Sold him.

1868
01:24:02.034 --> 01:24:04.550
TRAVIS: Pulls the pants up, tucks
them right above the knees.

1869
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:07.900
MATT: So, he takes his boots off and rolls up the legs

1870
01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.190
just beyond the knee and does

1871
01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:10.150
place his feet into the water.

1872
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:10.983
MARISHA: How's his feet look?

1873
01:24:10.983 --> 01:24:12.860
Are they, like, super delicate

1874
01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:15.230
from where he just, like, floats all the time?

1875
01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:16.973
SAM: Like, are they atrophied from not--
LAURA: I bet!

1876
01:24:16.973 --> 01:24:18.681
They're like your feet.

1877
01:24:18.681 --> 01:24:20.516
(laughter)

1878
01:24:20.516 --> 01:24:23.710
LAURA: It's like easily--
TALIESIN: How detailed are your notes?

1879
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:26.820
MATT: They are very, very well kept, soft feet

1880
01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.310
for a man who takes care of himself

1881
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:31.390
in the nobility. Sure, there you go.

1882
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:33.027
Well manicured.

1883
01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:34.310
(laughter)

1884
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:36.909
You can see a glass slipper just fitting right on.

1885
01:24:36.909 --> 01:24:38.975
(talking over each other)

1886
01:24:38.975 --> 01:24:40.861
(laughter)

1887
01:24:40.861 --> 01:24:42.650
(laughs) Writing it in your notes.

1888
01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:43.760
Jesus, you guys.

1889
01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:46.741
ASHLEY: Underneath his floating robes,
he just has glass slippers.

1890
01:24:46.741 --> 01:24:47.670
(laughter)

1891
01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:48.503
Just floating.

1892
01:24:48.503 --> 01:24:50.097
(laughter)

1893
01:24:50.097 --> 01:24:51.310
That's why he does, that's why he floats,

1894
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:52.798
doesn't want to break them.

1895
01:24:52.798 --> 01:24:53.977
MATT: I need some alcohol in this.

1896
01:24:53.977 --> 01:24:54.810
(laughter)

1897
01:24:54.810 --> 01:24:55.790
TRAVIS: Hyperbaric fun chamber.

1898
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:56.830
SAM: Something occurred to me when you were

1899
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:59.860
talking about lives and reborn and stuff like that.

1900
01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:02.150
In your den or when you were growing up--

1901
01:25:02.150 --> 01:25:05.270
wait, how many people live here in Xhorhas?

1902
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:07.460
Like, thousands, right?
MATT: "In Xhorhas,

1903
01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:10.310
"between the Dynasty's influence in particular,

1904
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:17.200
"hm, somewhere between, in the neighborhood of 300,000".

1905
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:19.760
LAURA: Whoa.
MATT: "Within the Dynasty.

1906
01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.820
"That involves multiple cities, probably more than that.

1907
01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:24.530
"There are many of those who exist

1908
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:26.973
"outside of the Dynasty's purview."

1909
01:25:26.973 --> 01:25:27.998
SAM: I just thought maybe you might

1910
01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:30.590
have heard of a friend of ours, maybe.

1911
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:35.560
Have you ever heard of someone named Lucien or Nonagon?

1912
01:25:37.684 --> 01:25:39.320
MATT: "I cannot say I have."

1913
01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.470
SAM: Hm.
MATT: "My apologies."

1914
01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:43.163
SAM: All right.

1915
01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.780
Worth a shot.

1916
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.780
MARISHA: Yeah, there was this story he told me.

1917
01:25:48.948 --> 01:25:49.781
LAURA: What?

1918
01:25:50.784 --> 01:25:52.000
MATT: It was right before he died.

1919
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.420
There was this story he told me

1920
01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:57.130
about how he convinced some town he was a god.

1921
01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:58.490
TRAVIS: Mollytown.
MARISHA: Somewhere.

1922
01:25:58.490 --> 01:26:00.845
Yeah, somewhere out there.
LAURA: Molly has a cult.

1923
01:26:00.845 --> 01:26:02.350
MARISHA: Huh?
LAURA: Molly has a cult.

1924
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:03.300
MARISHA: Molly has a cult.

1925
01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:05.540
Somewhere out there, there is a town

1926
01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.440
that thinks Molly is the shit.

1927
01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.740
SAM: Why did they think that about him?

1928
01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.490
TRAVIS: Do you know more about this story?

1929
01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:15.160
ASHLEY: I vaguely remember it and I feel like

1930
01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.450
it always made me laugh.

1931
01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:18.770
MARISHA: Yeah, it was actually a good story.

1932
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:20.460
LIAM: We're all in the hot tub by now, right?

1933
01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:21.293
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

1934
01:26:21.293 --> 01:26:22.770
MATT: You've all lined in front of the hot tub

1935
01:26:22.770 --> 01:26:24.940
and he just has his feet over the edge.

1936
01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.657
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think that, uh-- (chuckles)

1937
01:26:27.657 --> 01:26:29.637
MARISHA: Nott's in a hoodie on the bench.

1938
01:26:30.765 --> 01:26:32.470
TALIESIN: I'm just making notes on
improvements for the hot tub.

1939
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:34.112
I've got plans for this thing.

1940
01:26:34.112 --> 01:26:34.945
It's going to be great.
LAURA: I wonder if

1941
01:26:34.945 --> 01:26:37.115
we strung up lights from the roots--

1942
01:26:37.115 --> 01:26:38.073
TALIESIN: That's what I was thinking.

1943
01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:39.090
You could do--

1944
01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:40.777
Plus I'm going to try and get some

1945
01:26:40.777 --> 01:26:42.587
plants that like the steam

1946
01:26:42.587 --> 01:26:44.970
that smell really good, so you'll have always have--

1947
01:26:44.970 --> 01:26:47.330
LIAM: Caleb sends the globules of light

1948
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:49.540
to sort of hover around in the roots

1949
01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.190
MARISHA: Can you make them change colors?

1950
01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.192
Can you make them rotate through the color spectrum?

1951
01:26:55.192 --> 01:26:56.794
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus Christ.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1952
01:26:56.794 --> 01:26:58.217
Do it.

1953
01:26:58.217 --> 01:26:59.193
(clunking)

1954
01:26:59.193 --> 01:27:01.093
(laughter)

1955
01:27:01.093 --> 01:27:02.776
TRAVIS: Did you just go (stomps)?
LIAM: Yeah.

1956
01:27:02.776 --> 01:27:04.191
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

1957
01:27:04.191 --> 01:27:05.290
(laughter)

1958
01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:07.280
TALIESIN: Send word to disco.

1959
01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.630
MARISHA: Does it work?
LIAM: They're amber.

1960
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:09.859
MARISHA: Do they work?
MATT: Yeah, they do.

1961
01:27:09.859 --> 01:27:11.060
(cheering)

1962
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.280
MARISHA: Bootie.
MATT: It's

1963
01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.030
simple enough to do with a cantrip.

1964
01:27:15.610 --> 01:27:17.530
MARISHA: Hey, Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Yeah?

1965
01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:19.550
MARISHA: While we're getting real and shit,

1966
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:25.296
why have you never wanted to scry on any of your siblings?

1967
01:27:27.274 --> 01:27:28.270
You've been separated from them.

1968
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:31.110
They went off looking for these things.

1969
01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.160
Why not check in?

1970
01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:38.250
TALIESIN: As the token sober person in this group.

1971
01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:40.120
LAURA: I'm also sober.
TALIESIN: Are you also sober?

1972
01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:40.953
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Have I

1973
01:27:40.953 --> 01:27:42.137
not noticed that you haven't been drinking?

1974
01:27:42.137 --> 01:27:44.630
LAURA: I don't drink.
SAM: She just drinks milk.

1975
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:46.720
LIAM: It's that low perception you have.

1976
01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.800
TALIESIN: Token sober person who's just really not been

1977
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.430
paying attention to what you've been drinking.

1978
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:53.140
LAURA: It's okay. I always seem
slightly drunk anyway, I think.

1979
01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.732
TALIESIN: It's part of your charm.

1980
01:27:57.990 --> 01:28:00.610
I don't know, it's either,

1981
01:28:02.965 --> 01:28:05.530
if you had asked me that a month ago,

1982
01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.680
I would've said, "Because I don't need to."

1983
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:10.710
MARISHA: Why?

1984
01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:14.180
TALIESIN: Because I'm on this path,
it's the right path...

1985
01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.310
TALIESIN: And, uh--
LAURA: But we're asking you now.

1986
01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.040
TALIESIN: I think I'm on this path

1987
01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.790
and I do think it's the right path.

1988
01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:28.240
Maybe I'm afraid.

1989
01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:32.660
MARISHA: Afraid something happened to them?

1990
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.070
TALIESIN: Afraid that if something did

1991
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:37.618
happen to them, what would it mean?

1992
01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:40.143
I,

1993
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:46.460
I don't want to open the envelope, so to say,

1994
01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:52.467
before it's time and be hurt before I'm there.

1995
01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:55.750
I'd rather trust

1996
01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.090
and try to

1997
01:29:01.450 --> 01:29:02.737
process the fear.

1998
01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:05.027
Fear is kind of new.

1999
01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:10.498
For the record, I'm,

2000
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:12.773
my home is dying,

2001
01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.230
slowly, up north.
MATT: (as Essek) "Sorry to hear that."

2002
01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:20.682
TALIESIN: I have been on a

2003
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:25.040
quest, sent by my goddess to

2004
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:30.471
fix my home, to bring it back to life,

2005
01:29:30.471 --> 01:29:32.504
to replenish it.

2006
01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:35.990
My family, all my family,

2007
01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:41.180
already begun this quest without me and

2008
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:44.770
I do not know if they are alive or dead,

2009
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:49.710
but this is the quest and I was given these people

2010
01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:52.809
and I have

2011
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:55.020
done my best to

2012
01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:00.560
support them as they have blossomed into heroes.

2013
01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.450
And I thought I was going to save my home

2014
01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:07.740
and regain my family and that would be my reward

2015
01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:11.232
and now I'm-- (sighs)

2016
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:15.800
this world has changed me, I don't know anymore.

2017
01:30:17.483 --> 01:30:19.977
I don't know what is going to happen,

2018
01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:23.702
not because I think that

2019
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:28.367
I've been lied to or been given the--

2020
01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:34.550
I don't necessarily believe that I understand

2021
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:36.350
what it is I've been asked to do yet

2022
01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:39.860
and I don't understand what it is I want anymore.

2023
01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:43.990
And that has shaken me,

2024
01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.236
but this is a very big world.

2025
01:30:48.236 --> 01:30:51.887
(chuckles) Ah, it's been a lot.

2026
01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:54.860
It's been nice to be useful.

2027
01:30:56.288 --> 01:30:57.520
LAURA: (clears throat)

2028
01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.490
LIAM: It's good to be useful.

2029
01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:02.120
TALIESIN: These are good people, despite themselves.

2030
01:31:03.263 --> 01:31:05.596
(chuckling)

2031
01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:09.580
MATT: "Faith is a strange thing."
TALIESIN: It is.

2032
01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.580
MATT: "That's why I find no use for it."

2033
01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.807
TALIESIN: I understand.
MATT: "But

2034
01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.240
"I hope you find what it is you're looking for."

2035
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:21.790
TALIESIN: Thank you, I'll find something, at the very least,

2036
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:24.598
and whatever it is will be,

2037
01:31:24.598 --> 01:31:26.360
in the end, what I was looking for.

2038
01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:31.750
MATT: "If there is any way I can be helpful,

2039
01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:35.170
"you know how to contact me."

2040
01:31:35.170 --> 01:31:38.263
He looks knowingly at Jester.

2041
01:31:38.263 --> 01:31:40.596
(chuckling)

2042
01:31:41.521 --> 01:31:44.120
LAURA: (laughs) Have you ever been doing something

2043
01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.090
that you were really embarrassed about

2044
01:31:46.090 --> 01:31:49.435
when I was talking to you?

2045
01:31:49.435 --> 01:31:51.700
(giggling)

2046
01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:53.534
MATT: "Not particularly."

2047
01:31:53.534 --> 01:31:55.867
TRAVIS: (chuckles)

2048
01:31:57.597 --> 01:31:58.922
LAURA: (laughs) Insight check.

2049
01:31:58.922 --> 01:32:01.130
(laughter)

2050
01:32:01.130 --> 01:32:02.454
(clapping)

2051
01:32:02.454 --> 01:32:03.685
MATT: Make an insight check.

2052
01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:04.518
(laughter)

2053
01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:06.091
SAM: Ya pooping?
LAURA: Ya pooping?

2054
01:32:06.091 --> 01:32:07.193
LIAM: The DM's blushing.

2055
01:32:07.193 --> 01:32:08.418
TALIESIN: Ah.
SAM: Okay, okay,

2056
01:32:08.418 --> 01:32:09.464
okay, okay.
LAURA: Uh huh, uh huh.

2057
01:32:09.464 --> 01:32:11.410
Insight?
MATT: Yes.

2058
01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:13.122
LAURA: 18.
MATT: 18.

2059
01:32:15.156 --> 01:32:16.256
(laughter)

2060
01:32:16.256 --> 01:32:17.747
(clapping)

2061
01:32:17.747 --> 01:32:19.890
SAM: This whisper is going to be, "He was pooping."

2062
01:32:22.190 --> 01:32:23.834
Oh, guys.

2063
01:32:23.834 --> 01:32:26.885
(talking over each other)
(laughter)

2064
01:32:26.885 --> 01:32:28.770
SAM: You guys, D&amp;D Beyond will feature

2065
01:32:28.770 --> 01:32:30.490
a lot of the stuff that's coming up

2066
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:33.660
in the Wildemount Explorer's Guide.

2067
01:32:35.645 --> 01:32:37.580
TALIESIN: Did you, okay.
MATT: "Anyway.

2068
01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.160
"The evening draws late.

2069
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.750
"I should probably return to my home.

2070
01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:45.203
"Thank you--"
LAURA: You could

2071
01:32:45.203 --> 01:32:46.418
spend the night here.

2072
01:32:46.418 --> 01:32:49.080
MATT: "I live not far from here."

2073
01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.460
LAURA: How come we never seen your house?

2074
01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:52.750
MATT: "Well, perhaps--"
SAM: Next time?

2075
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:55.810
MATT: "Perhaps if you wanted to discuss

2076
01:32:55.810 --> 01:32:58.250
"this equation you're working on--"

2077
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:59.650
SAM: Yes, what's your address?

2078
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:01.650
MATT: "I'll show it to you.

2079
01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:04.840
"Easier to show than to describe, really."

2080
01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.760
SAM: Sure.
MATT: "Let me know when

2081
01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.780
"and I'll come show you to my place."

2082
01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:10.940
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "But."

2083
01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:12.767
He pulls his legs out of the water.

2084
01:33:14.184 --> 01:33:16.830
LAURA: Are they shriveled?
MARISHA: Hee hee hee hee.

2085
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:20.400
MATT: In the natural way a foot would be after spending,

2086
01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.480
you know, 30 minutes in a hot tub, sure.

2087
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.749
TRAVIS: Natural feet.

2088
01:33:23.749 --> 01:33:25.310
(laughter)

2089
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:27.750
SAM: I accidentally, like, brush up against one

2090
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:29.493
to see if it's an illusion.

2091
01:33:29.493 --> 01:33:30.326
(chuckling)

2092
01:33:30.326 --> 01:33:31.507
MATT: No, it's a foot.

2093
01:33:31.507 --> 01:33:33.323
(laughter)

2094
01:33:33.323 --> 01:33:34.821
SAM: Oh, sorry, sorry.

2095
01:33:34.821 --> 01:33:36.230
(laughter)

2096
01:33:36.230 --> 01:33:37.670
TRAVIS: Brush up against it.

2097
01:33:38.996 --> 01:33:39.829
(laughter)

2098
01:33:39.829 --> 01:33:42.463
MATT: You guys are so weird.
SAM: Sorry!

2099
01:33:42.463 --> 01:33:43.725
(laughter)

2100
01:33:43.725 --> 01:33:44.860
I thought that was a piece of soap.

2101
01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:48.390
I was picking it up and didn't want ya to slip on it.

2102
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:50.569
MATT: "I feel like you're over apologizing."

2103
01:33:50.569 --> 01:33:52.260
(laughter)

2104
01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.093
Matt: "It's fine."

2105
01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:58.580
Anyway, he goes and goes ahead and replaces his mantle

2106
01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.880
and returns to the front door and says,

2107
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.923
"This was nice.

2108
01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.750
"Thank you."
LAURA: Thank you!

2109
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:09.723
That was really fun.
LIAM: Could you,

2110
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:12.100
could we walk, could you show me

2111
01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:14.810
where you live so we know where to go?

2112
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:16.140
MATT: "Sure, come with."
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

2113
01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:18.842
MARISHA: I'm coming, too.
MATT: "All right."

2114
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.890
LAURA: I'm going to stay here.
SAM: Yeah, let them go.

2115
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:23.970
LAURA: Watch from the window.
SAM: It's too weird.

2116
01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:25.770
MATT: He leads you outside and as he steps off

2117
01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:29.320
of the threshold of the front door,

2118
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.600
you watch him lift back up into his

2119
01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.890
general hovering persona, shoulders held aloft.

2120
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.790
He guides you through the neighborhood,

2121
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:41.830
the path you would take to the Bastion

2122
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:43.520
that curves into the neighborhood to where your house is,

2123
01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:45.500
it's past that circle and then it leads

2124
01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.800
deeper into an area that would be

2125
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.450
the equivalent of a Rosohna gated community, I guess.

2126
01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:53.550
There are guards there, there are folks that are,

2127
01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:55.650
you know, guarding an estate and there is--

2128
01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.550
it's-- as opposed to a singular,

2129
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:59.510
you're used to the Candles,

2130
01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:02.050
this large, elaborate, you know, wizard towers.

2131
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:05.680
His estate is three towers that are shorter,

2132
01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.930
but they're all connected by walkways

2133
01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:08.830
and they're different heights.
LAURA: Ooh.

2134
01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:13.040
MATT: And atop the--
MARISHA: He's got a fun house.

2135
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.010
MATT: Atop of the tallest one, you can see there

2136
01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:17.410
what looks at first like a weather vane.

2137
01:35:17.410 --> 01:35:18.860
Instead, you can see is a contraption

2138
01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:23.630
that seems to have a series of metallic rings inside

2139
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:26.440
that all are smaller and smaller and smaller within

2140
01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.520
that slowly, like, rotate on its own

2141
01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.980
in a way that you're not understand its purpose

2142
01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:32.510
or really what it does but it's unique

2143
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:35.340
and it's engineered to be

2144
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:38.460
strangely pretty.

2145
01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:44.180
You can see the brick exterior of it falls,

2146
01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:47.040
it looks gray, but what little bit of light there is

2147
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:50.650
as you walk past, you can see now the--

2148
01:35:50.650 --> 01:35:53.500
there's a slight iridescent almost quality

2149
01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.160
to the exterior of the bricks

2150
01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.160
that are laid at the base of the towers.

2151
01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.940
He just points to it and goes,

2152
01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:03.740
"This is where you can find me most of the time--

2153
01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:06.100
LIAM: This is--
MATT: "Ever."

2154
01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.130
LIAM: --fascinating. Is this to do with

2155
01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:11.550
the turning of the heavens or--

2156
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:15.820
MATT: "This has to do more with the adjusting of the--

2157
01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:19.500
"how do I put it?

2158
01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:23.800
"There are almost ley lines of energy

2159
01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.260
"that themselves span like a net across all of Exandria

2160
01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:32.290
"and these ley lines sometimes shift and swell

2161
01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:35.540
"and expand and reduce based on the seasons,

2162
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.859
"based on the time of year, based on

2163
01:36:37.859 --> 01:36:42.080
"celestial gatherings and alignments.

2164
01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.210
"This is part of a device that just

2165
01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:46.520
"keeps track of it."
LIAM: Mirrors it.

2166
01:36:47.469 --> 01:36:50.673
(inhales) Well, now we know where you live.

2167
01:36:51.710 --> 01:36:53.210
I would like to take you up on your offer

2168
01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:56.960
to examine that thing that Nott and I are working on.

2169
01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.630
I have a number of things, including some souvenirs

2170
01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:06.080
from inside the Happy Fun Ball we told you about.

2171
01:37:07.257 --> 01:37:08.650
MATT: "I'm very curious about that."

2172
01:37:08.650 --> 01:37:10.856
LIAM: So am I and I think

2173
01:37:10.856 --> 01:37:14.468
you and I share interests.

2174
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:19.320
I understand the pressure

2175
01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:23.300
being young and the expectation.

2176
01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:29.560
I am not 120 years old, but I feel like

2177
01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.860
I understand a little bit.

2178
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.980
MATT: "I have seen those far older than you that have

2179
01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:38.140
"experienced maybe half the pain I see in your eyes.

2180
01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:39.190
"Age isn't everything.

2181
01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:44.160
"Experience is what hardens you, prepares you for the worst.

2182
01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:46.260
"I think you're prepared for more than

2183
01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.060
"you give yourself credit for, Caleb."

2184
01:37:49.290 --> 01:37:52.280
LIAM: Well, we'll come back later and compare notes.

2185
01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:55.050
MATT: "I'll be here.

2186
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:59.458
"Perhaps I can provide breakfast as a thank you."

2187
01:37:59.458 --> 01:38:00.625
MARISHA: Dope.

2188
01:38:02.901 --> 01:38:04.966
LIAM: I'm just thinking about
mimosas from your house, right?

2189
01:38:04.966 --> 01:38:05.799
(laughter)

2190
01:38:05.799 --> 01:38:07.620
MATT: Oh.
TALIESIN: I have that green jam.

2191
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:09.860
LAURA: Uh huh, it's really good.

2192
01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:13.040
MATT: "Well, good night."
MARISHA: Glad you got home safe.

2193
01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.790
MATT: "Thank you for the escort."
MARISHA: Yep.

2194
01:38:15.918 --> 01:38:17.160
(whooshing)

2195
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.144
(laughter)

2196
01:38:19.144 --> 01:38:22.554
MATT: And he just drifts off to-- the gate opens on its own

2197
01:38:22.554 --> 01:38:24.460
(creaking, slamming)

2198
01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:26.500
and he heads up to the interior.

2199
01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.980
MARISHA: How weird that that's the thing

2200
01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:31.580
you just get stuck with, like, floating.

2201
01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:34.790
Like people who put on an accent for

2202
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:37.790
half of a year and then, and then

2203
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:39.960
how are you going to get yourself out of it?

2204
01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.230
LIAM: Or a name or--
MARISHA: Yeah.

2205
01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:43.590
LIAM: Burning things.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2206
01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:46.490
Basically, like, half of our crew probably has

2207
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:48.690
something like that, but his is floating

2208
01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:52.683
and he's just committed to floating.

2209
01:38:52.683 --> 01:38:54.760
(laughter)

2210
01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:57.900
LIAM: Commit to the bit, Beauregard.

2211
01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.090
MARISHA: But like, why?

2212
01:38:59.090 --> 01:39:01.540
Does he feel, like, is he, he's going to have shame?

2213
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:05.450
Does he feel ashamed if he doesn't float?

2214
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:09.760
It's just so fascinating.

2215
01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.900
LIAM: It's one of many things that are fascinating

2216
01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:13.450
about him, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2217
01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:16.600
LIAM: But at least we know there are feet under there

2218
01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.898
and a full, full adult-sized body, not a tiny baby.

2219
01:39:20.898 --> 01:39:23.148
(laughter)

2220
01:39:26.652 --> 01:39:28.151
So stupid.

2221
01:39:28.151 --> 01:39:29.130
(laughter)

2222
01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:31.060
Let's go back.
MATT: All right.

2223
01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:34.670
You guys return to the Xhorhaus, it is late in the evening.

2224
01:39:34.670 --> 01:39:38.272
Many of you are enjoying the tale end

2225
01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:41.250
of a wine buzz after dinner and spending time

2226
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:42.930
in the hot tub.
LIAM: Yeah.

2227
01:39:42.930 --> 01:39:44.246
MATT: Unless you have any other business

2228
01:39:44.246 --> 01:39:45.429
to attend to this night--

2229
01:39:45.429 --> 01:39:47.390
LAURA: No, but seriously, what am I doing wrong, you guys?

2230
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:48.865
SAM: What do you mean? About what?

2231
01:39:48.865 --> 01:39:51.620
LAURA: Well, like, I feel like I do a really bad job of,

2232
01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.680
you know, recruiting other people to--

2233
01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.410
SAM: It's a tough sell!
LAURA: Why, though?

2234
01:39:56.410 --> 01:39:58.430
Why is it a tough sell?

2235
01:39:58.430 --> 01:40:01.130
SAM: Well, I mean, (sighs) what does he,

2236
01:40:01.130 --> 01:40:04.442
so, what does he do for you?

2237
01:40:04.442 --> 01:40:08.263
LAURA: He gives me really cool powers
and he's a good companion and he loves me.

2238
01:40:08.263 --> 01:40:10.390
SAM: You didn't mention that to Essek.

2239
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:12.410
You didn't say that he gives you cool powers.

2240
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:15.100
You just said that he appears and he's always around

2241
01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:17.762
and he makes you do good stuff and bad stuff.

2242
01:40:17.762 --> 01:40:19.874
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Basically like a mom.

2243
01:40:19.874 --> 01:40:22.620
TRAVIS: You listed some pros and cons and in the con column,

2244
01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:26.210
you mentioned people might get murdered and that was okay.

2245
01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:30.765
SAM: And the pro column was maybe they have to make babies.

2246
01:40:30.765 --> 01:40:32.430
LAURA: But some people like making babies

2247
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:34.300
SAM: Sure, sure, who doesn't like making babies?

2248
01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:39.140
But still, I mean, maybe next time lead with,

2249
01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:42.310
"I have sight beyond sight now because of him."

2250
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:43.540
TRAVIS: Do you?
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

2251
01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:45.860
Well, I mean, yeah, I can see, scry on people.

2252
01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:47.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe pick, like, three bullet points--

2253
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:49.310
LAURA: I should've, like, done the Thaumaturgy thing

2254
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:51.390
and made something look really cool.

2255
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:52.570
MARISHA: Wait, what's in your-- I don't think

2256
01:40:52.570 --> 01:40:53.830
I've ever read your pamphlet.

2257
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:55.290
What do you have in your pam, what,

2258
01:40:55.290 --> 01:40:58.100
read us the bullet points.
SAM: Oh no.

2259
01:40:58.100 --> 01:40:59.919
It's not great.
TRAVIS: You don't want it.

2260
01:40:59.919 --> 01:41:02.420
Yeah, we know that--
MARISHA: Does it talk about murdering

2261
01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:05.420
things in the pamphlet?
TRAVIS: No, she ad-libbed that.

2262
01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:07.900
SAM: Most of it says stuff about how cool he is.

2263
01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:09.270
He's really cool.
LAURA: He is cool!

2264
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:12.064
SAM: No, I know, but that's not a very--

2265
01:41:12.064 --> 01:41:13.340
ASHLEY: Is there pictures of him or anything?

2266
01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:15.020
LAURA: Yeah, drawings, I made drawings.

2267
01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:17.760
TRAVIS: She did the drawings--
ASHLEY: Oh wait, you made this,

2268
01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.220
you made this brochure?
SAM: There's three drawings

2269
01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:21.470
of his cloak.
ASHLEY: I understand, okay.

2270
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:22.740
SAM: I mean, she's really proud of the cloak.

2271
01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.150
LAURA: It's a really cool cloak!

2272
01:41:24.150 --> 01:41:25.630
I mean, I haven't seen what he

2273
01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:26.770
looks like outside the cloak--

2274
01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:28.080
It's like all I see is a cloak.

2275
01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.870
TRAVIS: New candidate for the Traveler, it's me.

2276
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:32.980
Sell me three things about the Trav--

2277
01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:36.253
LAURA: I tried to sell you on
the Traveler and you went Wildmother instead!

2278
01:41:36.253 --> 01:41:38.870
TRAVIS: I'm not Fjord, I'm Jeff.

2279
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:42.610
Tell Jeff what it is about the Traveler in three points.

2280
01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:44.660
SAM: And Jeff just had a traumatic experience.

2281
01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:48.140
He's open, he's available.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay,

2282
01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:49.640
okay, okay, okay.
TRAVIS: I'm seeking

2283
01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:50.680
change and direction.

2284
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.840
TALIESIN: Is your real name Jeff?
TRAVIS: Yes, it's Jeff.

2285
01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.530
TALIESIN: Okay.
TRAVIS: J, J.

2286
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:56.648
MARISHA: Yeah, Jeff with a J.
LAURA: Yes, I understand,

2287
01:41:56.648 --> 01:41:58.098
you're feeling lost right now.

2288
01:41:58.098 --> 01:41:59.106
TRAVIS: (sighs)

2289
01:41:59.106 --> 01:42:00.645
LAURA: You know what could really help you?

2290
01:42:00.645 --> 01:42:02.050
TRAVIS: Hmm?

2291
01:42:02.050 --> 01:42:03.958
LAURA: The Traveler.

2292
01:42:03.958 --> 01:42:06.900
TRAVIS: Who's the Traveler and what does he do?

2293
01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:07.733
TALIESIN: Guidance.

2294
01:42:09.232 --> 01:42:10.065
LAURA: Well,

2295
01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:14.320
he's a really cool guy.

2296
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.600
TRAVIS: Okay, I like cool guys.

2297
01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.960
What else, what else should I know about the Traveler?

2298
01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.390
ASHLEY: He saved my life.
LAURA: He saved my life.

2299
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:22.170
LIAM: A pearl lowers in front of Jester's forehead

2300
01:42:22.170 --> 01:42:24.822
and little geometric shapes come out.

2301
01:42:24.822 --> 01:42:25.663
TALIESIN: (wheezing)

2302
01:42:25.663 --> 01:42:27.507
More Guidance.
LAURA: He,

2303
01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.720
he gave, he-- at one time I was alone and lost in the world

2304
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:38.138
and the Traveler came to me and he

2305
01:42:38.138 --> 01:42:39.340
made me feel better

2306
01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:43.010
and he gave me some really cool powers and he made me

2307
01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:45.720
feel special like he can make you feel special.

2308
01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.778
TRAVIS: He gave you cool powers?

2309
01:42:47.778 --> 01:42:50.278
LAURA: Yeah! Like,

2310
01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:57.780
like, I will, Spirit Guardians. (snaps)

2311
01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.430
And there's fat little unicorns flying around now.

2312
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:04.800
TRAVIS: Are they friendly?
LAURA: Yeah, they love everyone

2313
01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.450
except, unless you're, you know,

2314
01:43:06.450 --> 01:43:08.450
going to harm me and then they'll kill you.

2315
01:43:09.341 --> 01:43:11.080
TRAVIS: I don't want to harm you.
LAURA: I know,

2316
01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.590
and the Traveler doesn't want

2317
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:15.173
to harm you.
ASHLEY: He keeps you safe.

2318
01:43:15.173 --> 01:43:16.370
TRAVIS: I've heard two--
LAURA: Keeps you safe.

2319
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:18.640
TRAVIS: Two great things about the Traveler.

2320
01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:20.543
If only I had one more.

2321
01:43:20.543 --> 01:43:24.620
(wheezing)
(laughter)

2322
01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:25.469
LAURA: Um.

2323
01:43:25.469 --> 01:43:27.319
SAM: Speak from your heart, Jester.

2324
01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.600
LAURA: He--

2325
01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:36.070
SAM: What were you lacking before that he filled?

2326
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:39.820
LAURA: Well, I was really lonely and,

2327
01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:43.612
you know, he's a really good friend and

2328
01:43:47.402 --> 01:43:51.050
he just accepts you for who you are

2329
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:53.720
and he likes all the things that are good about you

2330
01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.712
and he makes them stronger.

2331
01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.570
TRAVIS: Jeff is sold.
LAURA: Really?

2332
01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:01.552
TRAVIS: That's great.

2333
01:44:01.552 --> 01:44:03.126
Jeff needs a friend,

2334
01:44:03.126 --> 01:44:05.803
Jeff needs someone who takes him as he is,

2335
01:44:05.803 --> 01:44:06.894
Jeff is down.

2336
01:44:06.894 --> 01:44:08.904
LAURA: Jeff, do you want to go to Traveler Con?

2337
01:44:08.904 --> 01:44:11.382
We're have a con in a volcano coming up soon.

2338
01:44:11.382 --> 01:44:12.828
TRAVIS: What? No.

2339
01:44:12.828 --> 01:44:15.686
(laughter)

2340
01:44:15.686 --> 01:44:18.770
(clapping)
(laughter)

2341
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:20.370
Jester, that was great.

2342
01:44:20.370 --> 01:44:22.070
Maybe leave out the volcano.

2343
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:23.510
LAURA: But it's an important part.

2344
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:25.987
TRAVIS: "Tropical location."
SAM: Yeah.

2345
01:44:25.987 --> 01:44:26.920
LAURA: Ooh.

2346
01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.860
MARISHA: Some people might be--
ASHLEY: But that's lying--

2347
01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:29.693
TRAVIS: No, it's not.

2348
01:44:29.693 --> 01:44:32.220
It's a tropical location.
ASHLEY: It is?

2349
01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, we don't know if
it's an active or dormant volcano,

2350
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:37.730
but when you say volcano, people go, "Active volcano."

2351
01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:39.540
ASHLEY: Well, some people might think that's cool

2352
01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.410
because they've never seen a volcano.

2353
01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:42.243
LAURA: Right?

2354
01:44:42.243 --> 01:44:44.362
I've never, well I have seen a volcano because we went

2355
01:44:44.362 --> 01:44:45.810
to a volcano.
TALIESIN: We did.

2356
01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:47.970
MARISHA: Also, traveling is expensive.

2357
01:44:47.970 --> 01:44:51.830
Maybe they're just price gated out of the experience.

2358
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:53.810
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Jeff has never left home

2359
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:56.430
and has trouble traveling over open water, so, you know.

2360
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:59.500
SAM: Jeff has a very imaginative back story.

2361
01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:02.779
ASHLEY: Jeff, where are you from?

2362
01:45:02.779 --> 01:45:05.112
(chuckling)

2363
01:45:06.301 --> 01:45:09.267
TRAVIS: Pride's Call, I'm an archeologist.

2364
01:45:09.267 --> 01:45:12.347
SAM: Oh shit, he's responsible for the Beacon.

2365
01:45:12.347 --> 01:45:14.804
Kill him, kill him, flay his flesh!

2366
01:45:14.804 --> 01:45:17.054
(laughter)

2367
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:19.830
TRAVIS: Jester, I think that's great.

2368
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:20.670
SAM: Yeah.

2369
01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:23.660
If Jeff were really, you'd be getting somewhere.

2370
01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:25.785
TRAVIS: Focus on the positive, you can't lose.

2371
01:45:25.785 --> 01:45:26.618
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

2372
01:45:26.618 --> 01:45:29.080
TRAVIS: Maybe leave out the murdering people.

2373
01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.610
ASHLEY: Is this what he looks like, though,

2374
01:45:30.610 --> 01:45:32.410
what you have in the picture?

2375
01:45:32.410 --> 01:45:33.840
LAURA: Well, yeah.

2376
01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.830
Yeah, he is, like, sometimes he's big,

2377
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:38.963
sometimes he's little, sometimes he's,

2378
01:45:38.963 --> 01:45:43.430
you know, just, like, the perfect size.

2379
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:47.580
ASHLEY: Very, so he looks very handsome.

2380
01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:50.920
LAURA: Well, you can't really, that's how I imagine he looks

2381
01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.310
because I haven't actually seen like his face-his face.

2382
01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:55.420
ASHLEY: You just see, like--
LAURA: But sometimes when he turns

2383
01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:57.300
and, like, his cloak moves,

2384
01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:59.390
I see, like, this, like silhouette

2385
01:45:59.390 --> 01:46:00.890
and I can see that it's, like,

2386
01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.670
really good looking.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

2387
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:08.670
LAURA: He's very handsome.
ASHLEY: He's handsome.

2388
01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:14.420
TRAVIS: Caduceus, I was moved by what you said earlier

2389
01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:17.015
about your family and your quest.

2390
01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:21.440
I want to help you with that.
MARISHA: Yeah, same.

2391
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.820
TRAVIS: I don't know if I
quite understood the urgency before

2392
01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:26.800
about your home and it dying and you need to reinstate,

2393
01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.060
the needing to reinstate that--

2394
01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.870
ASHLEY: How do you grow your home again?

2395
01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:33.020
TALIESIN: Well--
ASHLEY: What does that mean?

2396
01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:34.194
TALIESIN: I don't know entirely,

2397
01:46:34.194 --> 01:46:36.685
but I think this has something to do with it.

2398
01:46:36.685 --> 01:46:40.664
And I pull out the--
MATT: The purple crystal.

2399
01:46:40.664 --> 01:46:44.080
You see the, and you guys, most of them were present

2400
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.540
for when you placed the residuum shards

2401
01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:50.190
into the forge in the volcano.

2402
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:53.400
The purple crystals that grew from them

2403
01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.130
and they're not solid, smooth, chiseled crystals,

2404
01:46:56.130 --> 01:46:58.200
they're naturally grown,

2405
01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.140
rock candy-looking purple crystals

2406
01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:02.390
that have expanded off of the residuum glass

2407
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:06.342
into these larger shards that are about that long each.

2408
01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:10.380
And he has a handful of them in his hand.

2409
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.810
LAURA: Have you tried licking them?

2410
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:16.560
TALIESIN: Surprisingly not, no.
LAURA: Maybe you should lick it.

2411
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.540
ASHLEY: Are you supposed to plant it?

2412
01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:20.957
TALIESIN: Do you want to lick it?
TRAVIS: We could ask-- okay.

2413
01:47:20.957 --> 01:47:21.887
TALIESIN: What do you think?

2414
01:47:21.887 --> 01:47:23.213
MATT: It's salty.
LAURA: What does it taste like?

2415
01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:27.750
Like a rock? Like, is it salty?
MATT: Like a salty mineral.

2416
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:30.230
LAURA: It's salty.
TRAVIS: And what is that

2417
01:47:30.230 --> 01:47:32.800
and what is its purpose exactly?

2418
01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:33.850
I'm sure you've told us again,

2419
01:47:33.850 --> 01:47:35.839
I just never listen to anything.

2420
01:47:35.839 --> 01:47:38.370
(laughter)

2421
01:47:38.370 --> 01:47:39.480
TALIESIN: I don't entirely know.

2422
01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.510
It came out of the forge.

2423
01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:46.220
I think that I have to go

2424
01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:49.318
to this,

2425
01:47:51.521 --> 01:47:54.460
this garden, the Menagerie, and

2426
01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:01.710
find some way of taking something

2427
01:48:01.710 --> 01:48:05.480
from it to bring back to my garden.

2428
01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.630
ASHLEY: So is it like a seed?

2429
01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:09.820
TALIESIN: Hopefully.

2430
01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:12.160
LAURA: Interesting.
TRAVIS: We should do that.

2431
01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:13.760
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that on the way.

2432
01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:15.560
MARISHA: Why didn't you tell us sooner?

2433
01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.260
TALIESIN: I mean--
TRAVIS: You kind of did.

2434
01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:19.080
TALIESIN: I did.
MARISHA: You did, but you didn't,

2435
01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.470
every time we brought it up, you were like,

2436
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:22.378
"Yeah, it can wait."

2437
01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:24.330
ASHLEY: Can I see?

2438
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:26.090
TRAVIS: Selfless to a fault, maybe?

2439
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:28.000
MARISHA: Maybe.
TALIESIN: Perhaps fear.

2440
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:28.833
Perhaps I...

2441
01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.050
am afraid of what I'll find.

2442
01:48:35.050 --> 01:48:39.350
I don't know, but I knew I was heading that way

2443
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:42.488
and I knew that I would get there, so

2444
01:48:42.488 --> 01:48:46.957
I was letting the urgency of what had to be done

2445
01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.550
be important that take precedent,

2446
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:52.450
I guess, and I'm glad I did.

2447
01:48:54.138 --> 01:48:56.802
We needed to do what was done

2448
01:48:56.802 --> 01:49:01.785
and I would've hated to have gotten in the way of that, but

2449
01:49:04.230 --> 01:49:08.360
the next step is to go and to the next sacred site

2450
01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.710
and hopefully find my family,

2451
01:49:11.710 --> 01:49:13.990
hopefully find some or at least some sign

2452
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:15.440
that they have been there and

2453
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.800
find the next thing I'm supposed to do.

2454
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.370
TRAVIS: Fuck yes!

2455
01:49:21.370 --> 01:49:22.840
I've been in this hot tub too long

2456
01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.960
and my core body temperature is rising.

2457
01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.170
I'm in, let's do this.

2458
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:30.880
I feel real fucking dizzy.
MARISHA: Oh.

2459
01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.900
Sit, oh no.
TRAVIS: No, give me another drink.

2460
01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:34.340
MARISHA: No, no, no.
TRAVIS: Listen.

2461
01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:35.620
Listen, listen, listen.

2462
01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:39.427
Tomorrow we go, we get your armor, and then we go f--

2463
01:49:39.427 --> 01:49:41.630
MARISHA: There he goes.
SAM and LAURA: Oh no.

2464
01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:45.692
LAURA: I lift him out!

2465
01:49:45.692 --> 01:49:48.150
Yasha, help me get him out of the water now.

2466
01:49:48.150 --> 01:49:50.111
TALIESIN: So heavy even though he's so little.

2467
01:49:50.111 --> 01:49:51.450
(laughter)

2468
01:49:51.450 --> 01:49:53.000
LAURA: He's not, he's gotten bigger.

2469
01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:55.920
He's heavier than he used to be.

2470
01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:59.973
TALIESIN: Family, the family of Stone.

2471
01:49:59.973 --> 01:50:01.549
(reading) "You shall take the limbs of this hero

2472
01:50:01.549 --> 01:50:04.980
"and walk the plains until you find an oasis,

2473
01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.992
"at the mouth of a red and gold-veined cave.

2474
01:50:07.992 --> 01:50:10.770
"There upon my altar, you shall feed these limbs

2475
01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:14.960
"to the beasts that walk there so that they may hold my mark

2476
01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.970
"and to this site, you shall build a menagerie

2477
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:19.770
"whose beasts shall be my gift to the Changebringer

2478
01:50:19.770 --> 01:50:22.295
"to remind her that nature is infinite."

2479
01:50:23.370 --> 01:50:25.495
MARISHA: Do you get all that?

2480
01:50:25.495 --> 01:50:27.990
TRAVIS: No, I--

2481
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:29.331
I got that.

2482
01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.280
The family of S-S-Stone?
TALIESIN: Family of Stone.

2483
01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:37.140
Dust, Clay, and Stone, three families.

2484
01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:38.940
LAURA: What, do you know something, what?

2485
01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.633
TRAVIS: Ah,

2486
01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:47.150
yeah, I mean, yes, no, (scoffs) I find it ironic.

2487
01:50:47.150 --> 01:50:47.983
SAM: What?

2488
01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.720
TRAVIS: When you're at an orphanage, they give you a,

2489
01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:56.870
they give you a shit last name.

2490
01:50:57.970 --> 01:50:59.982
Mine was Stone.

2491
01:50:59.982 --> 01:51:02.610
TALIESIN: (laughs)

2492
01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:04.463
TRAVIS: I never used it because it's not,

2493
01:51:04.463 --> 01:51:06.717
it's not my name, it was just given to me--

2494
01:51:06.717 --> 01:51:09.422
TALIESIN: Insight check.
MATT: Make an insight check.

2495
01:51:10.716 --> 01:51:13.557
TALIESIN: That was terrible, 15.

2496
01:51:13.557 --> 01:51:14.574
TRAVIS: It's the truth.

2497
01:51:14.574 --> 01:51:15.990
TALIESIN: Wow.

2498
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:18.173
SAM: They gave you the name Stone?

2499
01:51:18.173 --> 01:51:21.610
TRAVIS: Yes, but orphans can have

2500
01:51:21.610 --> 01:51:25.420
any kind of bland, ordinary last name.

2501
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.190
LAURA: But you got Stone.
TRAVIS: Yes.

2502
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:29.660
It's very strange, I think it's totally--

2503
01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:32.126
TALIESIN: Family of the Wildmother.

2504
01:51:32.126 --> 01:51:33.900
MARISHA: That you now follow.

2505
01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:37.100
SAM: What a tough name.
LAURA: Wow!

2506
01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:38.719
MARISHA: Fjord Stone, wow.

2507
01:51:38.719 --> 01:51:41.040
TRAVIS: It's fucking--

2508
01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.281
(groaning)

2509
01:51:43.281 --> 01:51:45.728
TALIESIN: I'm not a believer in coincidences.

2510
01:51:45.728 --> 01:51:46.950
TRAVIS: (groaning)

2511
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:48.668
TALIESIN: Even when they happen--

2512
01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:49.990
(laughter)

2513
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:53.022
TRAVIS: Wee-oo wee-oo wee-oo.

2514
01:51:53.022 --> 01:51:56.307
(grunting)
(laughter)

2515
01:51:56.307 --> 01:51:58.178
LIAM: It wouldn't be the first one in this group.

2516
01:51:58.178 --> 01:51:59.700
TALIESIN: No.

2517
01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:01.520
Family of Stone, though.

2518
01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.710
That's one of the three families.

2519
01:52:03.710 --> 01:52:06.100
LAURA: Wow.

2520
01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:07.550
TALIESIN: I've never met any of them.

2521
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:10.064
LAURA: Now you have, you have.
TRAVIS: Either way, either way,

2522
01:52:10.064 --> 01:52:11.600
I'm very interested to go.

2523
01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.730
TALIESIN: I'm somehow even more
interested than I was a minute ago.

2524
01:52:15.730 --> 01:52:17.540
Maybe there'll be something else for you here

2525
01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:20.543
and you certainly found something at the last--

2526
01:52:20.543 --> 01:52:23.920
LAURA: Oh wow.
SAM: This is exciting.

2527
01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:26.420
TRAVIS: I always wondered what my, who my parents were

2528
01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:27.920
and what my real name might be.

2529
01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:30.090
I never cared for that name, so--

2530
01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:33.430
TALIESIN: Well.
TRAVIS: I just find it--

2531
01:52:35.009 --> 01:52:37.297
TALIESIN: I will say as part of what I do

2532
01:52:37.297 --> 01:52:40.835
and part of what we do at the garden,

2533
01:52:42.650 --> 01:52:44.300
names have a funny way of

2534
01:52:46.730 --> 01:52:49.730
sneaking up on you and we definitely,

2535
01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:51.820
the people that we put into our garden,

2536
01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:56.791
their names are, their names have quite the effect, so.

2537
01:52:58.270 --> 01:53:02.015
Yeah, look at that, all the way back around.

2538
01:53:03.171 --> 01:53:04.228
(chuckling)

2539
01:53:04.228 --> 01:53:05.965
TRAVIS: I need ice water, I'm going to burn.

2540
01:53:05.965 --> 01:53:07.920
TALIESIN: Yeah, you look a little green.

2541
01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:10.460
LAURA: Like a really pale green.
TALIESIN: That's like a minty green.

2542
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:12.230
TRAVIS: It's just my pigment, thank you.

2543
01:53:12.230 --> 01:53:14.252
LAURA: No, no, no. This is definitely lighter than--

2544
01:53:14.252 --> 01:53:16.010
ASHLEY: It is a different color.

2545
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:17.930
MARISHA: Uh, work out in the morning, so.

2546
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:19.040
TRAVIS: What?
MARISHA: Yep.

2547
01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:22.056
TRAVIS: That should've been disclosed pre-hot--
MARISHA: I'll knock on your door.

2548
01:53:22.056 --> 01:53:24.297
(laughter)

2549
01:53:24.297 --> 01:53:25.787
SAM: We'll go to sleep.
MATT: All right, you guys all

2550
01:53:25.787 --> 01:53:29.350
scatter to your respective rooms in the Xhorhaus

2551
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:32.681
and post-dinner, post-hot tub--

2552
01:53:32.681 --> 01:53:34.335
MARISHA: Oh yeah, pass out so hard.

2553
01:53:34.335 --> 01:53:37.830
MATT: Enjoy an evening of rest in a home

2554
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:40.197
that you can call, ah, except for?

2555
01:53:41.094 --> 01:53:43.938
LIAM: Just a quick thing, she's wandering the halls.

2556
01:53:45.216 --> 01:53:48.650
Hey, Jester.
LAURA: Me?

2557
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:50.869
I thought you were looking for Nott.
LIAM: Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

2558
01:53:50.869 --> 01:53:51.716
SAM: No--
LAURA: No, it's okay,

2559
01:53:51.716 --> 01:53:53.341
I was just thinking.
SAM: I'll leave.

2560
01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:57.230
LIAM: Good night, but,

2561
01:53:59.130 --> 01:54:02.117
you look like you're knocking yourself a little bit, and

2562
01:54:03.258 --> 01:54:05.820
I don't think you should.

2563
01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:08.303
Do you know what I think about the Traveler?

2564
01:54:08.303 --> 01:54:09.136
LAURA: What?

2565
01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:13.327
LIAM: I think that he is lucky to have you.

2566
01:54:15.695 --> 01:54:18.487
I'm the transmutation wizard, but

2567
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:23.053
you're the one who changes people.

2568
01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:25.522
See it every day.

2569
01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:27.553
LAURA: Really?

2570
01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.753
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

2571
01:54:33.130 --> 01:54:38.130
You're a good friend and you move people.

2572
01:54:38.630 --> 01:54:43.567
I don't know if you see that, but you do, every day.

2573
01:54:46.336 --> 01:54:48.719
LAURA: Thank you.

2574
01:54:48.719 --> 01:54:51.052
LIAM: No, thank you.

2575
01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:56.452
LAURA: Can I tell you something?
LIAM: Yeah.

2576
01:54:57.469 --> 01:55:01.347
LAURA: (clears throat) Earlier, we were in the park

2577
01:55:02.370 --> 01:55:04.610
and I was trying to talk to the Traveler,

2578
01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:07.743
I even bought him some ice cream,

2579
01:55:07.743 --> 01:55:10.526
and he didn't come.

2580
01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:16.420
And, to be honest, it's one of the

2581
01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:19.713
first times that I didn't feel him

2582
01:55:20.956 --> 01:55:22.214
near me

2583
01:55:23.307 --> 01:55:28.307
and I wonder maybe I'm not doing a very good job of,

2584
01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:33.622
you know, being a cleric to him or whatever.

2585
01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:43.672
LIAM: You're trying to bring more people into the fold.

2586
01:55:43.672 --> 01:55:48.350
LAURA: Well, see, that's the thing.

2587
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:52.938
When I set out, when I left Mama, I didn't,

2588
01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:56.880
I didn't leave with the goal of recruiting

2589
01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.100
a bunch of people to,

2590
01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:02.705
to this religion, you know?

2591
01:56:02.705 --> 01:56:07.160
I just, I had this good friend

2592
01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:11.578
that saw me through my life and (sighs)

2593
01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:17.643
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

2594
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:23.243
LIAM: Well, maybe Traveler Con will--

2595
01:56:25.825 --> 01:56:27.300
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Help with that.

2596
01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:28.400
LAURA: Yeah, maybe it will.

2597
01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:34.070
LIAM: I don't know anything about faith.

2598
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:39.067
I am learning from you and the others in the group.

2599
01:56:41.230 --> 01:56:43.660
But it seems

2600
01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:44.785
inexplicable.

2601
01:56:45.859 --> 01:56:47.330
LAURA: Yeah.

2602
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:49.126
LIAM: Otherwise it wouldn't be faith.

2603
01:56:49.126 --> 01:56:50.811
LAURA: Well, if you ever want to worship the Traveler,

2604
01:56:50.811 --> 01:56:55.203
you know, you can just, he's really cool.

2605
01:56:55.203 --> 01:56:57.864
LIAM: Well, everybody kind of made sport in there,

2606
01:56:57.864 --> 01:57:00.720
but we are all low key acolytes of the Traveler,

2607
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:02.503
you realize that, don't you?

2608
01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:07.400
LAURA: Yeah?
LIAM: I mean, we're with you.

2609
01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.550
LAURA: You see his power every day.
LIAM: Every day.

2610
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:11.505
I believe, I have no choice.

2611
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:16.090
LAURA: Sometimes I wonder if maybe
he doesn't come around as much

2612
01:57:16.090 --> 01:57:19.981
because he sees, you know,

2613
01:57:19.981 --> 01:57:22.606
that I have some friends now

2614
01:57:22.606 --> 01:57:26.410
and he doesn't need to be here as much.

2615
01:57:26.410 --> 01:57:28.960
LIAM: That seems like a good theory.

2616
01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:31.670
Also, Traveler Con is coming, so maybe preparations

2617
01:57:31.670 --> 01:57:33.890
are underway on a cosmic level of some sort.

2618
01:57:33.890 --> 01:57:35.190
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, that's true.

2619
01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:37.910
LIAM: You know, I think we should go to bed,

2620
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:42.390
but I want to show you something that I've been working on.

2621
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:46.170
I don't know what you have planned for Traveler Con,

2622
01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:50.312
but if I can help in any way
with something like this. And...

2623
01:57:51.695 --> 01:57:56.428
little lollipops and hamster unicorns that are amber-colored

2624
01:57:56.428 --> 01:58:00.055
start floating around us as I cast

2625
01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:02.520
Major Image?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2626
01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.960
LIAM: In an approximation but it's

2627
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.577
a more Widogast amber flavor.

2628
01:58:09.177 --> 01:58:11.750
I just figured this out a couple of weeks ago,

2629
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:14.930
so I don't know if you need effects or--

2630
01:58:14.930 --> 01:58:17.539
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
LIAM: Decorations.

2631
01:58:17.539 --> 01:58:20.257
MARISHA: That's a step and repeat.
LAURA: I mean, it's beautiful.

2632
01:58:20.257 --> 01:58:22.030
LIAM: Lollipops are just rotating.
LAURA: If I, if I did,

2633
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:24.070
like a performance or something, you know,

2634
01:58:24.070 --> 01:58:27.230
like maybe if we play our musical instruments

2635
01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:29.580
and, like, you can have this, you know, like,

2636
01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:34.158
around us, it'll be, like, this amazing thing.

2637
01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.313
LIAM: Yes.

2638
01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:40.380
I don't know, I'm not a performer.

2639
01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:44.200
LAURA: This is wonderful, Caleb.
LIAM: But

2640
01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:48.540
you have done so much for m-- all of us

2641
01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:50.480
that of course we should do this for you.

2642
01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:53.925
You deserve it.

2643
01:58:53.925 --> 01:58:56.016
LAURA: Thank you.

2644
01:58:56.016 --> 01:58:57.477
I give him a big hug.

2645
01:59:01.150 --> 01:59:03.410
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, okay, good night.
LAURA: Okay.

2646
01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:04.810
Thank you.

2647
01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:07.450
TALIESIN: I got a quick one, too.

2648
01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:08.865
MATT: Can we get to that in just a second, please?

2649
01:59:08.865 --> 01:59:10.065
TALIESIN: Yeah, go.

2650
01:59:11.106 --> 01:59:13.481
MATT: You guys scatter to your rooms

2651
01:59:13.481 --> 01:59:15.414
and you go back feeling better.

2652
01:59:15.414 --> 01:59:18.450
You close the door and you sigh

2653
01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:20.910
and start preparing yourself for the evening's rest

2654
01:59:20.910 --> 01:59:22.380
and then you hear a familiar voice

2655
01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:27.322
creep in over you shoulders: "He's not wrong, Jester."

2656
01:59:30.023 --> 01:59:31.950
LAURA: Wait, he's not wrong about, he's not wrong

2657
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:35.270
about you are doing big preparations?

2658
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:38.490
MATT: "Well, there's a big event coming up, of course.

2659
01:59:38.490 --> 01:59:42.633
"But not wrong coming about you changing those around you.

2660
01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:49.298
"Even if I'm not there in person, I'm always there,"

2661
01:59:49.298 --> 01:59:51.350
and you see the face come over your shoulder

2662
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:52.800
and a familiar hood lean forward,

2663
01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:56.280
the smile across the lips and the arm touch your shoulder.

2664
02:00:00.210 --> 02:00:04.538
"I know faith can be challenging, but

2665
02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:10.360
"you were my first and you'll always be my favorite.

2666
02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:12.610
LAURA: (laughs)

2667
02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:15.590
Do you want me to do a big performance?

2668
02:00:15.590 --> 02:00:18.009
Do you want me to do something special at Traveler Con?

2669
02:00:18.009 --> 02:00:19.670
I realize I haven't asked you any questions, I mean,

2670
02:00:19.670 --> 02:00:23.210
you ask questions about what you want me to do.

2671
02:00:23.210 --> 02:00:24.660
Should I get cloaks together?

2672
02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:30.900
MATT: "Sure."
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay.

2673
02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:31.990
MATT: "I trust your ideas.

2674
02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.980
"I trust your inspirations.

2675
02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:42.140
LAURA: We're going to make it so special.

2676
02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:47.140
MATT: "That we shall."
LAURA: (giggles) I can't wait.

2677
02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:48.920
MATT: Caduceus.

2678
02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:51.614
(laughter)

2679
02:00:51.614 --> 02:00:54.248
TALIESIN: Taking a second, thank you.

2680
02:00:54.248 --> 02:00:58.648
I'm going to quickly just crawl over
to Yasha's room as she's--

2681
02:00:58.648 --> 02:01:00.678
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: -- passing out.

2682
02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:03.430
So--
ASHLEY: Hello.

2683
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:05.360
TALIESIN: Hi, I just wanted to put this

2684
02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:08.707
in your head before we go any further.

2685
02:01:11.790 --> 02:01:16.170
Nobody's really talked about what happened

2686
02:01:16.170 --> 02:01:18.110
during the fight and I'm--

2687
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:25.192
some of the others, and I think you'll agree, are--

2688
02:01:27.850 --> 02:01:30.459
well, this is a group of loners

2689
02:01:30.459 --> 02:01:33.890
and I'm very used to other people's grief and sadness.

2690
02:01:33.890 --> 02:01:35.010
I've been around it my whole life

2691
02:01:35.010 --> 02:01:38.040
and I've seen every way someone can react

2692
02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.740
to the worst things in their life.

2693
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:41.713
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2694
02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:50.460
I understand that that was maybe not the best way to

2695
02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.670
deal with it, but--

2696
02:01:56.670 --> 02:02:01.667
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm not here to speak down to your process.

2697
02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:07.053
I'm not here to tell you how to
feel what you're going to feel.

2698
02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:12.380
Just make sure

2699
02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:16.970
that for whatever grief and rage

2700
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:19.770
and anger that you're going to process,

2701
02:02:19.770 --> 02:02:24.210
that you just put 10, 20% of it

2702
02:02:24.210 --> 02:02:27.526
on someone else and not just yourself.

2703
02:02:27.526 --> 02:02:29.610
You don't have to do too much, but you have to

2704
02:02:29.610 --> 02:02:32.810
do a little bit with other people.

2705
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:34.718
You can't do it alone.

2706
02:02:36.910 --> 02:02:38.201
ASHLEY: Thank you.

2707
02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:41.210
I don't quite know how to do that yet,

2708
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:45.220
but maybe I will learn.
TALIESIN: Stormlord's good for that

2709
02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:49.040
and you have a good group of friends and

2710
02:02:52.810 --> 02:02:57.718
they made a promise to save you from

2711
02:02:57.718 --> 02:02:59.919
the thing that took you and
I'm sure that they're still looking forward

2712
02:02:59.919 --> 02:03:01.457
to fulfilling that promise.

2713
02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:04.633
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2714
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:06.783
I,

2715
02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:13.178
(inhales) this is going to sound very strange, but

2716
02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:16.518
ugh, I'm,

2717
02:03:18.567 --> 02:03:21.440
(exhaling)

2718
02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:25.087
can I sleep in your room?

2719
02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:28.770
Not in a weird way, I just seem to--

2720
02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:34.690
TALIESIN: I shared a single room with a lot of family, yes.

2721
02:03:34.690 --> 02:03:37.970
I may snore, they claim I snore, I don't think it's true.

2722
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:40.850
ASHLEY: I don't care, I've heard crazy things--

2723
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:42.550
TALIESIN: Come on.
ASHLEY: -- when I sleep, but I,

2724
02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:46.700
I think I'm just

2725
02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:50.778
scared to sleep alone.

2726
02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:56.179
TALIESIN: Sure, any time.
ASHLEY: Okay.

2727
02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:03.050
I'm very excited to help you.

2728
02:04:05.250 --> 02:04:07.142
TALIESIN: I'm excited to help you, too.

2729
02:04:10.224 --> 02:04:11.650
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: I really don't snore.

2730
02:04:11.650 --> 02:04:13.148
I don't know why they say it.

2731
02:04:13.148 --> 02:04:15.968
(laughter)

2732
02:04:15.968 --> 02:04:17.268
ASHLEY: Well, I do.

2733
02:04:17.268 --> 02:04:21.474
(laughter)

2734
02:04:21.474 --> 02:04:25.700
MATT: All right, as you all--
ASHLEY: Can I read a little before?

2735
02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:29.070
I have four hours left.
MATT: It's about,

2736
02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:33.000
I'd say at this point, because you guys didn't,

2737
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.040
I'd say about 11.

2738
02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:34.920
It's not too terribly late.

2739
02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:36.850
You could read until three and finish it if you want.

2740
02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:39.516
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's do it.
MATT: Okay.

2741
02:04:39.516 --> 02:04:40.907
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: Staying up late.

2742
02:04:40.907 --> 02:04:44.110
TALIESIN: Do-do-do-doo.
LIAM: Yes, Snore-phan Maker.

2743
02:04:44.110 --> 02:04:45.340
(laughter)

2744
02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:47.530
LAURA: Snore-phan Maker. (laughs)

2745
02:04:47.530 --> 02:04:49.130
TALIESIN: (snoring)

2746
02:04:49.130 --> 02:04:53.950
MATT: Caduceus does snore.
SAM: 100%.

2747
02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:57.420
MATT: But you were engrossed, whether by

2748
02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:00.369
the dynamic of the writing of this book,

2749
02:05:00.369 --> 02:05:05.360
the unrecognized enchantment that draws you in

2750
02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.240
and takes hold and has progressively

2751
02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:11.770
been imprinting upon you the magic it holds,

2752
02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:16.050
and the occasionally delightful, extremely graphic

2753
02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:17.620
short stories that are interspersed

2754
02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:19.153
throughout some of the back pages.

2755
02:05:19.153 --> 02:05:21.240
TALIESIN: Pilates for [Inaudible].
TRAVIS: Yep.

2756
02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:22.350
MATT: You complete your reading of the book

2757
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:24.888
and as you close the final--
ASHLEY: The butter churner.

2758
02:05:24.888 --> 02:05:27.138
(laughter)

2759
02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:31.214
MATT: As you close the final bit--

2760
02:05:31.214 --> 02:05:32.222
ASHLEY: Well, that was a first choice.

2761
02:05:32.222 --> 02:05:34.480
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: So good.

2762
02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:36.700
MATT: As you close the back of the book,

2763
02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:39.230
an overwhelming exhaustion hits you and immediately,

2764
02:05:39.230 --> 02:05:43.190
your eyes dip, dip, and you fall asleep

2765
02:05:43.190 --> 02:05:45.060
holding the book to your chest,

2766
02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:46.860
back still against the wall.

2767
02:05:47.779 --> 02:05:48.970
And that's where we're going to take our break.

2768
02:05:48.970 --> 02:05:50.738
(cheering)

2769
02:05:50.738 --> 02:05:53.280
All righty, we'll be back here in a few minutes

2770
02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.800
after a very role play-heavy first half.

2771
02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:58.030
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Fucking cool, though, man.

2772
02:05:58.030 --> 02:05:58.863
MATT: It was awesome.

2773
02:05:58.863 --> 02:06:01.288
MARISHA: Stone?
MATT: We have our Wyrmwood giveaway tonight is

2774
02:06:01.288 --> 02:06:03.030

02:06:11.991 --> 02:06:13.453
Enter it once and only once,

2779
02:06:13.453 --> 02:06:14.686

and once again, only for folks

in the US and Canada, excluding Quebec.

2782
02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:19.230
We'll come back shortly with a winner

2783
02:06:19.230 --> 02:06:21.423
and then the rest of tonight's session. (clicks tongue)

2784
02:06:21.423 --> 02:06:24.310
MARISHA: There's got to be, right?
TALIESIN: Yes.

2785
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:27.240
MATT (V.O.): In the world of Critical Role's Exandria,

2786
02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:29.110
a fresh conflict threatens to tear

2787
02:06:29.110 --> 02:06:31.560
the continent of Wildemount apart

2788
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:36.020
as the Dwendalian Empire and Kryn Dynasty prepare for war.

2789
02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:38.508
Hidden in this vast landscape are secrets that could

2790
02:06:38.508 --> 02:06:42.030
end the conflict and usher in a new age of peace

2791
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:44.660
or burn the world to a cinder.

2792
02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:47.060
In the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount,

2793
02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:49.920
players and dungeon masters will find a whole new continent

2794

to set their Dungeons &amp; Dragons stories,

2795
02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:53.750
with new adventures and monsters

2796
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:56.530
unique to the setting of Critical Role.

2797
02:06:56.530 --> 02:06:59.160
Players can use the new Heroic Chronicle to create

2798
02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:02.050
backstories that link their characters to Wildemount

2799
02:07:02.050 --> 02:07:04.080
and grow in power with new subclasses,

2800
02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:06.580
spells, and magic items, including the

2801
02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:08.780
reality-bending magic of dunamancy

2802
02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:10.300
and the Vestiges of Divergence,

2803
02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:12.380
which grow in power with their wielder.

in the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount.

2809
02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:27.010
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time, on Talks Machina.

2810
02:07:27.010 --> 02:07:28.360
BRIAN: Have you been on since you've been back?

2811
02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.560
Yeah, once, right?
ASHLEY: I have.

2812
02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:32.650
DANI: Once, with Matt, so.
ASHLEY: Oh, really?

2813
02:07:32.650 --> 02:07:33.483
BRIAN: No way!
MATT: Yeah.

2814
02:07:33.483 --> 02:07:35.330
DANI: It was with Matt.
ASHLEY: Is this just our routine?

2815
02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:37.050
MATT: I think so.

2816
02:07:37.050 --> 02:07:39.500
DANI: Not a baseball card variant, but--

2817
02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:40.620
BRIAN: That's awesome.
DANI: So good.

2818
02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:42.540
MATT: That works out.
ASHLEY: It works, it works.

2819
02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:45.600
BRIAN: Don't touch him again.
ASHLEY: I can't make any promises.

2820
02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:47.660
BRIAN: No, literally it's like an insurance thing.

2821
02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:49.670
Travis told me we're not allowed to touch Matt any more.

2822
02:07:49.670 --> 02:07:50.690
ASHLEY: It's going to happen.

2823
02:07:50.690 --> 02:07:52.394
BRIAN: Oh.

2824
02:07:52.394 --> 02:07:56.200
ASHLEY: It's very close.
BRIAN: Ooh. (alarm noise)

2825
02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:58.030
ASHLEY: Going to put just a little boop.

2826
02:07:58.030 --> 02:07:58.950
MATT: I got a knee boop.

2827
02:07:58.950 --> 02:08:02.080
BRIAN: "In the fight with Kal, was it Yasha's intention

2828
02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:04.500
"to prove to herself that she could be

2829
02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:06.970
"in control of the situation and herself,

2830
02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:09.610
"to do penance, or something else?

2831
02:08:09.610 --> 02:08:14.610
"Did you/Yasha know she was going to throw the fight

2832
02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:17.910
"when she agreed to come to the fight club?"

2833
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:19.780
ASHLEY: It wasn't until we met with

2834
02:08:23.498 --> 02:08:27.900
the person in the, behind the butcher's--

2835
02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.630
MATT: Right, right, the person
who's running the actual event.

2836
02:08:29.630 --> 02:08:31.610
ASHLEY: Yeah, what was their name?
DANI: Jacquel, I think.

2837
02:08:31.610 --> 02:08:32.550
MATT: Jacquel.
DANI: Yeah.

2838
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:34.210
ASHLEY: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: Jacquel.

2839
02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:37.930
ASHLEY: When she was sort of talking about

2840
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:43.840
fighting one of the champions and I think that just

2841
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:49.310
that word specifically triggered something for Yasha

2842
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:52.910
because of, you know, being a champion for--

2843
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:54.210
BRIAN: Yep.
ASHLEY: So

2844
02:08:56.540 --> 02:09:00.748
I, at that point, was like, "Oh, you know what?

2845
02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:04.164
"I think I'm going to throw the fight.

2846
02:09:04.164 --> 02:09:07.605
"I think I'm going to go in,
and I think for Yasha, this is a,

2847
02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:12.280
"this felt like something that she would need

2848
02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:16.500
"and I feel like she's still beating herself up and is,

2849
02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:21.870
"thinks she deserves that punishment for what she did."

2850
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:24.350
I think I've even talked about this before

2851
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:26.020
where I think it's so important

2852
02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:28.320
to give your characters obstacles

2853
02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.750
because it's more interesting to give them something

2854
02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:32.400
that they can overcome.
BRIAN: Right.

2855
02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:36.130
ASHLEY: And so, I'm very excited to see where she--

2856
02:09:36.130 --> 02:09:38.099
how she can pull herself out of this.

2857
02:09:38.099 --> 02:09:39.900
BRIAN: "Yasha has been powering through

2858
02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:41.970
"that tome for several days in a row.

2859
02:09:41.970 --> 02:09:43.800
"Does she enjoy reading?

2860
02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:45.780
"If so, what kinds of books does she like?

2861
02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:50.118
"Fitness-related ones like the tome or smut like the tome?"

2862
02:09:50.118 --> 02:09:52.434
(laughter)

2863
02:09:52.434 --> 02:09:54.930
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think she, she really likes

2864
02:09:54.930 --> 02:09:56.930
activities where she

2865
02:09:59.870 --> 02:10:00.703
gets to be alone.

2866
02:10:00.703 --> 02:10:03.530
I think reading a fitness book isn't necessarily

2867
02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:05.340
the first thing that she would go to.

2868
02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:07.740
BRIAN: Mm-hmm.
ASHLEY: But

2869
02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:08.573
I think

2870
02:10:10.150 --> 02:10:12.430
because Fjord gave it to her,

2871
02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:16.960
it was another gift

2872
02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:19.900
and she takes that very seriously.

2873
02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:22.730
BRIAN: "We knew with this being
the first game back from break,

2874
02:10:22.730 --> 02:10:25.440
"there would be a little finding the groove for the players.

2875
02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:27.610
"How do you balance letting them get their wiggles out

2876
02:10:27.610 --> 02:10:29.773
"with pushing the story forward?"

2877
02:10:29.773 --> 02:10:32.351
MATT: (laughs) Apparently by hiding behind my palms.

2878
02:10:32.351 --> 02:10:33.184
(laughter)

2879
02:10:33.184 --> 02:10:35.190
BRIAN: 20 times, right?

2880
02:10:35.190 --> 02:10:36.890
MATT: If you can sense the players are having fun,

2881
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:39.530
you let them have fun and it's funny in the right moments

2882
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:42.460
to throw some wrenches in that

2883
02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:46.112
or throw a nod to a direction that something's happening.

2884
02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:49.190
So, it's just something you feel with your group.

2885
02:10:49.190 --> 02:10:50.310
You learn it over time and, like,

2886
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:52.040
since I've known these guys for so long,

2887
02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:53.590
I know when they're having fun and they're on a roll

2888
02:10:53.590 --> 02:10:55.190
and they're really enjoying the moment

2889
02:10:55.190 --> 02:10:56.660
and then I don't want to be like,

2890
02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:58.140
"All right guys, back to the narrative,"

2891
02:10:58.140 --> 02:10:59.850
if everyone's on the same page

2892
02:10:59.850 --> 02:11:00.860
and it's not going too long.

2893
02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:03.540
BRIAN: It would be really funny,
though, if Matt out of nowhere

2894
02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:06.406
was like, "Hey, stop."
ASHLEY: Stop it.

2895
02:11:06.406 --> 02:11:07.350
MATT: (claps) Eyes forward!

2896
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:09.340
BRIAN: I was not up til 2:00am

2897
02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:11.830
typing these four pages--
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2898
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:14.560
BRIAN: -- for this farmer to tell you, you know.

2899
02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:17.130
MATT: I demand <i>respect</i> at this <i>table</i>!

2900
02:11:18.303 --> 02:11:20.123
<i>God!</i>
BRIAN: I would die, I would die.

2901
02:11:20.123 --> 02:11:21.331
ASHLEY: We would all start laughing.

2902
02:11:21.331 --> 02:11:22.639
MATT: Yeah, you would.
BRIAN: I would die.

2903
02:11:22.639 --> 02:11:24.273
ASHLEY: We'd be like--

2904
02:11:24.273 --> 02:11:26.080
Ahh! (laughs)

2905
02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:27.710
MATT: Then I just got up and left for, like, 20 minutes.

2906
02:11:27.710 --> 02:11:28.750
ASHLEY: Yeah, and we'd be like, "Oh shit,

2907
02:11:28.750 --> 02:11:30.130
"we really did--"
BRIAN: Oh yeah, the pouty, like--

2908
02:11:30.130 --> 02:11:30.963
MATT: Yeah.
BRIAN: The pouty

2909
02:11:30.963 --> 02:11:31.940
leave of the table.
MATT: And then it

2910
02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:35.700
gets really awkward, then I come back and just, I,

2911
02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:37.502
I'm really sorry about that, guys.

2912
02:11:37.502 --> 02:11:38.974
(laughter)

2913
02:11:38.974 --> 02:11:41.020
DANI: Just Joaquin Phoenix it.

2914
02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:42.720
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah, straight up, straight up.

2915
02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:46.550
BRIAN: "Did Yasha know Molly's cards were incomplete?

2916
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:49.560
"What would she think of Jester continuing the cards?"

2917
02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:51.850
ASHLEY: I don't think Yasha would be upset

2918
02:11:51.850 --> 02:11:54.250
that Jester would sort of complete--

2919
02:11:54.250 --> 02:11:57.267
BRIAN: Continue the cards, yeah.
ASHLEY: -- the deck because

2920
02:11:58.370 --> 02:12:02.216
I think Jester is one of those characters that

2921
02:12:02.216 --> 02:12:04.440
you, she wears her heart on her sleeve

2922
02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:06.880
and you know her heart.

2923
02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:09.980
BRIAN: She's sentimental.
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I think,

2924
02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:11.410
I think if

2925
02:12:11.410 --> 02:12:16.410
if that deck went to anybody who would use them,

2926
02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:19.579
it couldn't have, it just couldn't have

2927
02:12:19.579 --> 02:12:21.990
gone in better hands.
MATT: Yeah,

2928
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:23.840
there couldn't have been a more chaotic person--

2929
02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:24.990
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: -- for Molly to have been

2930
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:28.070
happy to see them go to.
ASHLEY: Yes, yeah.

2931
02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:30.740
I think Yasha knows that Molly

2932
02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:33.220
would be so happy.
BRIAN: Yeah.

2933
02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:35.120
I also am convinced that Jester is

2934
02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:38.120
the evil big bad so she's going to use the cards

2935
02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:40.700
in some sort of magical way to kill all of you.

2936
02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:42.520
MATT: No comment.
ASHLEY: I just can't--

2937
02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.060
I can't wait to see how Laura uses them

2938
02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:46.940
because I know it's going to be amazing.

2939
02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:48.710
BRIAN: Yeah, she doesn't forget about stuff.

2940
02:12:48.710 --> 02:12:51.690
ASHLEY: No.
MATT: Jester has been such

2941
02:12:51.690 --> 02:12:56.690
an unknown, like, pressure valve for Laura's id

2942
02:12:57.220 --> 02:12:58.900
that I don't think any of us could've expected.

2943
02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:00.390
BRIAN: What a great way to put it.
MATT: Like, it's a whole

2944
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:02.270
aspect of her that,

2945
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:03.800
she didn't create Jester outta thin air.

2946
02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:05.000
Jester was a part of her that's been,

2947
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.320
like, dying to be released--
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2948
02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:08.670
MATT: -- for so long and we're all just, like,

2949
02:13:08.670 --> 02:13:11.000
learning so much about Laura through this campaign.

2950
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.930
I'm like, "Oh man, we got to hang out more."

2951
02:13:14.930 --> 02:13:16.570
ASHLEY: Yeah, definitely, yeah.

2952
02:13:16.570 --> 02:13:18.420
BRIAN: And that's the first question he's answered

2953
02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:21.340
without touching the, uh, is that

2954
02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:23.450
the eyes on the octopus there?

2955
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:25.255
MATT: Oh, I'm touching it.

2956
02:13:25.255 --> 02:13:26.621
DANI: (laughs) Oh.

2957
02:13:26.621 --> 02:13:29.675
(laughter)

2958
02:13:29.675 --> 02:13:33.020
DANI: And that question just got a lot stranger.

2959
02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:36.120
BRIAN: Make no mistake, my friend, I am touching it.

2960
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:38.070
LIAM: Subscribe

2961
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:41.280
or don't subscribe.

2962
02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:45.913
That's not a question.

2963
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:51.220
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to ponder the pros

2964
02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:54.797
and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime

2965
02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:58.500
or to take hands and gift new subs

2966
02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:00.947
to Critters who find they can't afford them.

2967
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:04.161
To play,

2968
02:14:06.730 --> 02:14:07.863
to sleep

2969
02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:10.560
no more.

2970
02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:15.710
And by a sleep to say the cast and crew of Crit'cal Role

2971
02:14:15.710 --> 02:14:17.130
might find their naps around

2972
02:14:17.130 --> 02:14:20.140
the hectic schedule of a live broadcast

2973
02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:22.620
that we have brought for your consumption,

2974
02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:25.262
both Critter and fan alike.

2975
02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:29.088
To play

2976
02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:31.366
or sleep.

2977
02:14:34.330 --> 02:14:36.350
No sleep,

2978
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:38.435
but just to stream.

2979
02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:41.160
Aye, there's the rub.

2980
02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:47.623
For with your subscription, what streams may come.

2981
02:14:51.678 --> 02:14:54.040
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tag line.

2982
02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:55.893
Do we got that?

2983
02:14:55.893 --> 02:14:56.810
Oh.

2984
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:58.375
That is Twitch poetry.

2985
02:14:59.871 --> 02:15:04.871
(groans) Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

2986
02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:07.020
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe,

2987
02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:10.533
gift some subscriptions, you, you got it.

2988
02:15:11.687 --> 02:15:14.021
(inhaling)

2989
02:15:14.021 --> 02:15:17.626
Wrong soliloquy for the skull but, uh,

2990
02:15:17.626 --> 02:15:19.163
that's fucking good.

2991
02:15:19.163 --> 02:15:21.996
(classical music)

2992
02:15:25.056 --> 02:15:27.806
(dramatic music)

2993
02:27:15.042 --> 02:27:16.300
MATT: Hello everyone, welcome back.

2994
02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:18.170
So--
MARISHA: Got it in.

2995
02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:20.333
MATT: You did. Before we get back, we have the

2996
02:27:20.333 --> 02:27:21.510
winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway.

2997
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:24.760
The winner tonight is Nick Styles X.

2998
02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:26.230
Like Mega Man X.

2999
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:27.630
Nick Styles X, congratulations.

3000
02:27:27.630 --> 02:27:29.820
We will get that sent out to you ASAP.

3001
02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:34.618
All righty, so.
LIAM: Curse you, Dr. Wowie?

3002
02:27:34.618 --> 02:27:36.102
(laughter)

3003
02:27:36.102 --> 02:27:37.320
MATT: Find that medio.

3004
02:27:38.543 --> 02:27:39.570
(laughter)

3005
02:27:39.570 --> 02:27:41.340
After an evening's rest in the Xhorhaus,

3006
02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:45.295
you all come back to a morning's wake,

3007
02:27:46.170 --> 02:27:48.137
sun not out because Rosohna.

3008
02:27:48.137 --> 02:27:49.843
MARISHA: (knocking)

3009
02:27:49.843 --> 02:27:52.050
Five miles, let's go.
SAM: Oh Jesus.

3010
02:27:52.050 --> 02:27:53.330
TRAVIS: No, no.
MARISHA: Come on.

3011
02:27:53.330 --> 02:27:55.110
TRAVIS: You've got to be fucking kidding me.

3012
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:57.060
MARISHA: You said you wanted to
get buff, man, you got pissed

3013
02:27:57.060 --> 02:27:59.800
at me last time.
TRAVIS: I can smell myself.

3014
02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:01.353
MARISHA: You'll sweat it out.
TRAVIS: All right, all right.

3015
02:28:01.353 --> 02:28:05.100
(clears throat) I'm up, I'm up. I join.

3016
02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:08.740
MATT: Yasha, as you wake up in the morning,

3017
02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:12.280
your whole body is sore like you'd come out of

3018
02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:14.380
an extended battle for a period of time.

3019
02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:17.010
And it's strange and you're like, "Ah."

3020
02:28:17.010 --> 02:28:18.580
MARISHA: Spider Man.
MATT: Yeah, in a very, very

3021
02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:21.290
minor Spider Man-like transformation, like,

3022
02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:25.135
you're slightly more swole than you previously were.

3023
02:28:26.189 --> 02:28:28.290
So your strength goes up by two.

3024
02:28:28.290 --> 02:28:30.650
LAURA: Two!
TRAVIS: Oh ho ho ho

3025
02:28:30.650 --> 02:28:32.646
shit.
LAURA: Two?

3026
02:28:32.646 --> 02:28:33.705
What does that take you to?

3027
02:28:33.705 --> 02:28:34.869
ASHLEY: (explosions)

3028
02:28:34.869 --> 02:28:36.081
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
LAURA: Does that take you to 20?

3029
02:28:36.081 --> 02:28:36.922
TRAVIS: Delts.
ASHLEY: No.

3030
02:28:36.922 --> 02:28:37.755
TRAVIS: Traps.

3031
02:28:38.814 --> 02:28:41.170
Triceps, biceps.
ASHLEY: I rolled so low.

3032
02:28:41.170 --> 02:28:43.380
TRAVIS: Lats, quads--
LIAM: Where you at in strength?

3033
02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:45.495
Where's that strength at?
ASHLEY: Let's see, let's see, let's see.

3034
02:28:45.495 --> 02:28:47.728
TRAVIS: Glutes. Hamstrings.
LAURA: ♪ 19. ♪

3035
02:28:47.728 --> 02:28:48.890
ASHLEY: It's 19, yeah.

3036
02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:52.820
TRAVIS: Rhomboids.
SAM: Coccyx.

3037
02:28:53.774 --> 02:28:56.024
(laughter)

3038
02:28:57.550 --> 02:28:59.284
TRAVIS: Sphincter. (laughs)

3039
02:28:59.284 --> 02:29:00.525
MATT: Go to your ability scores is

3040
02:29:00.525 --> 02:29:01.776
where you would find all of that.

3041
02:29:01.776 --> 02:29:03.206
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's not letting us in, though.

3042
02:29:03.206 --> 02:29:04.039
ASHLEY: You know what?

3043
02:29:04.039 --> 02:29:06.503
Maybe if I go to-- I have an idea.
TALIESIN: Okay.

3044
02:29:06.503 --> 02:29:10.350
TRAVIS: Yo, my sphincter's swole. (laughs)

3045
02:29:10.350 --> 02:29:11.400
(chair creaking)

3046
02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:12.516
Sorry.

3047
02:29:12.516 --> 02:29:13.491
MATT: So.

3048
02:29:13.491 --> 02:29:15.270
(laughter)

3049
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:16.570
SAM: Shit, over the break, we should've

3050
02:29:16.570 --> 02:29:17.710
talked about what we were going to do.

3051
02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:18.670
MATT: Yeah, what are you guys going to do?

3052
02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:20.480
SAM: Shit.
MATT: Hey Sam, whatcha going to do?

3053
02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:21.800
SAM: Uh, we made a to do list.

3054
02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:23.360
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to get that armor.

3055
02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:24.490
SAM: Yeah, let's go there first.

3056
02:29:24.490 --> 02:29:26.900
MARISHA: Well, is it going to fit her anymore?

3057
02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:28.770
LAURA: Yeah, of course, it was bracers.

3058
02:29:28.770 --> 02:29:31.130
MARISHA: Oh.
SAM: They can expand.

3059
02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:33.333
MARISHA: But have you seen her wrists now?

3060
02:29:33.333 --> 02:29:35.500
TRAVIS: Do you arrive back at the house, like--

3061
02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:38.167
Do you arrive back at the house,
like, 20 minutes before I do?

3062
02:29:39.292 --> 02:29:41.455
Five miles is no fucking joke.

3063
02:29:41.455 --> 02:29:42.805
MARISHA: No, it's not.
MATT: Can you not hear the music, Sam?

3064
02:29:42.805 --> 02:29:45.213
MARISHA: But I'm also pretty dope.

3065
02:29:45.213 --> 02:29:46.279
MATT: Okay, there you go.

3066
02:29:46.279 --> 02:29:50.480
TRAVIS: So, 30 minutes before I do?

3067
02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:53.200
SAM: Yasha, if you're awake, let's go get your bracies.

3068
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:56.126
TALIESIN: Wow.
ASHLEY: (low-pitched) Okay.

3069
02:29:56.126 --> 02:29:58.540
(laughter)

3070
02:29:58.540 --> 02:29:59.373
SAM: What the?

3071
02:30:01.152 --> 02:30:02.627
ASHLEY: (drawn out) What?

3072
02:30:02.627 --> 02:30:03.558
(laughter)

3073
02:30:03.558 --> 02:30:04.743
SAM: You talk that way now?!

3074
02:30:04.743 --> 02:30:05.913
Oh my god!

3075
02:30:05.913 --> 02:30:07.049
(laughter)

3076
02:30:07.049 --> 02:30:09.816
TALIESIN: Wow, yeah--
ASHLEY: Cool.

3077
02:30:09.816 --> 02:30:11.269
TALIESIN: Okay.
SAM: Good night's sleep.

3078
02:30:11.269 --> 02:30:13.970
TALIESIN: Okay.
ASHLEY: Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

3079
02:30:13.970 --> 02:30:16.670
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, wow.

3080
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:19.370
That changes so many things.

3081
02:30:19.370 --> 02:30:21.250
This is so cool.

3082
02:30:21.250 --> 02:30:23.632
LAURA: Whoa, your attacks are going
to be better and everything.

3083
02:30:23.632 --> 02:30:25.730
ASHLEY: (exhaling)

3084
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:29.603
Yeah, so I need to go get those bracers, but

3085
02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:34.980
I wonder if maybe they'll give us a deal. (laughs)

3086
02:30:36.028 --> 02:30:38.002
SAM: Do you not have enough money? Didn't we already pay?

3087
02:30:38.002 --> 02:30:40.590
ASHLEY: Well, I paid half.

3088
02:30:40.590 --> 02:30:42.620
SAM: How much do you owe?

3089
02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:46.520
ASHLEY: About 2,000 bones.

3090
02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:49.103
SAM: How much do you have?

3091
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:56.944
ASHLEY: I currently have about just under that.

3092
02:30:56.944 --> 02:30:58.101
LAURA: Okay--

3093
02:30:58.101 --> 02:30:59.333
SAM: Jester can maybe chip in.

3094
02:30:59.333 --> 02:31:00.410
LAURA: Yeah, I can--
ASHLEY: No, no, no,

3095
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:03.207
no, it's, no, I don't want you guys chipping in anymore.

3096
02:31:03.207 --> 02:31:04.100
I can figure this out.
LIAM: So are we

3097
02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:05.970
going to-- <i>heilige</i>.

3098
02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:10.210
ASHLEY: I don't know, I read that book, I finished it.

3099
02:31:10.210 --> 02:31:12.040
But I feel, like, very different.

3100
02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:13.370
TRAVIS: I got that book from Caleb, you know.

3101
02:31:13.370 --> 02:31:16.083
TALIESIN: I think we may have a spider problem in the house.

3102
02:31:16.083 --> 02:31:17.743
SAM: Yeah, she swallowed it.

3103
02:31:17.743 --> 02:31:19.900
LIAM: We should pass that book around.

3104
02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:22.900
ASHLEY: That extra layer that I had,
it's now just like (sucks).

3105
02:31:22.900 --> 02:31:24.740
TRAVIS: Yeah, where is that book now, anyway?

3106
02:31:26.970 --> 02:31:30.950
MATT: You have the book.
ASHLEY: It is, it's here.

3107
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:32.930
TALIESIN: Oh.
ASHLEY: Do you want to read it,

3108
02:31:32.930 --> 02:31:34.480
Fjord, since you gave it to me?

3109
02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:37.120
TRAVIS: I mean, it's clearly got some sort of

3110
02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:39.906
a regiment you're benefiting from.

3111
02:31:39.906 --> 02:31:41.189
LAURA: You know what's weird about it is, like--

3112
02:31:41.189 --> 02:31:43.180
TRAVIS: Can I borrow your P90X discs?

3113
02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:44.700
LAURA: It's got, like, words in it but

3114
02:31:44.700 --> 02:31:47.010
it seems just, like, lame now.

3115
02:31:47.010 --> 02:31:49.380
SAM: Yeah, like not magical anymore.

3116
02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:51.620
ASHLEY: It seems like when I was looking through it

3117
02:31:51.620 --> 02:31:53.810
again this morning that the only thing

3118
02:31:53.810 --> 02:31:58.185
that stuck is the sexy bits.

3119
02:31:58.185 --> 02:32:00.120
LIAM: It still has smut in it.

3120
02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:02.290
LAURA: You can read it, Fjord,
there's some good stuff in there.

3121
02:32:02.290 --> 02:32:05.570
TALIESIN: I thought I found a recipe
for something in there, too.

3122
02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:06.830
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah,

3123
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:09.590
some stuff in there I've never tried.

3124
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:11.870
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: I love a hot shower

3125
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:15.130
after a really long work out, you know,

3126
02:32:15.130 --> 02:32:18.090
where you just, like, sit in the shower for--

3127
02:32:18.090 --> 02:32:19.050
Hey, Yasha.

3128
02:32:19.050 --> 02:32:21.620
TALIESIN: Shower.
ASHLEY: Yeah,

3129
02:32:21.620 --> 02:32:24.180
I think I must must've had a good--

3130
02:32:24.180 --> 02:32:25.400
MARISHA: Are we commenting on this?

3131
02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:26.490
Are we talking about this?
LAURA: She's shredded.

3132
02:32:26.490 --> 02:32:27.770
ASHLEY: We're talking about it, yeah.

3133
02:32:27.770 --> 02:32:29.870
TALIESIN: I'm blaming spiders.
MARISHA: I just wasn't sure

3134
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:31.450
if I should, like, be coy or not.

3135
02:32:31.450 --> 02:32:33.050
LIAM: How did this happen overnight?

3136
02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:35.720
ASHLEY: I don't know.

3137
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:40.860
I didn't work out in my sleep or anything, I just,

3138
02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:44.620
I think, I think maybe it was something that I ate.

3139
02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:47.330
Like, you know when you're prepping for something

3140
02:32:47.330 --> 02:32:50.600
and then, like, I've heard

3141
02:32:52.100 --> 02:32:52.933
sometimes--

3142
02:32:52.933 --> 02:32:53.917
TRAVIS: Carbo loading?

3143
02:32:53.917 --> 02:32:55.267
TALIESIN: There was a lot of carbs in that meal.

3144
02:32:55.267 --> 02:32:58.672
It was a very, I did use, I used a lot of yams,

3145
02:32:58.672 --> 02:33:00.250
there's a lot of--
LIAM: Maybe you

3146
02:33:00.250 --> 02:33:03.510
ate poorly with Obann and now, with Caduceus, you know,

3147
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:04.850
after a couple--
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3148
02:33:04.850 --> 02:33:06.290
TRAVIS: We should switch to gluten free wines.

3149
02:33:06.290 --> 02:33:08.180
TALIESIN: It was like a beet yam--

3150
02:33:08.180 --> 02:33:11.380
SAM: Disgusting.
MARISHA: I have been working out

3151
02:33:11.380 --> 02:33:15.240
since 6:00am, and fucking she wakes up like that?

3152
02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:16.790
LAURA: You look great, Beau.
TALIESIN: I'll make some more

3153
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:18.310
brussel sprouts, whatever is necessary.

3154
02:33:18.310 --> 02:33:19.990
LAURA: You're so cut.
MARISHA: Thank you.

3155
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:21.540
ASHLEY: I mean, I learned a lot of--

3156
02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:23.300
LAURA: It suits your body, you know?

3157
02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:25.240
Like, you're perfect, just the way you are.

3158
02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:26.392
LIAM: You're like diamonds, you're just--

3159
02:33:26.392 --> 02:33:27.225
SAM: You know what?

3160
02:33:27.225 --> 02:33:31.647
Maybe aasimars have, like, a second puberty, you know?

3161
02:33:31.647 --> 02:33:33.810
Like, you just hit it, you just hit it last night.

3162
02:33:33.810 --> 02:33:34.710
LAURA: How old are you?

3163
02:33:37.316 --> 02:33:39.650
ASHLEY: I actually don't really know.

3164
02:33:39.650 --> 02:33:41.640
SAM: There you go, you just hit it.

3165
02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:44.070
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's possible.

3166
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:46.900
I don't know much about--
TRAVIS: Do you smell worse?

3167
02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:49.518
Like, did your BO just (whistles) through the roof?

3168
02:33:49.518 --> 02:33:52.490
ASHLEY: (sniffing)

3169
02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:55.224
TRAVIS: How do you smell?
ASHLEY: I smell like a crayon.

3170
02:33:55.224 --> 02:34:00.224
(laughter)

3171
02:34:01.178 --> 02:34:02.870
SAM: That's a good smell.

3172
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:04.240
(laughter)

3173
02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:05.647
ASHLEY: You know.

3174
02:34:05.647 --> 02:34:07.056
(laughter)

3175
02:34:07.056 --> 02:34:10.247
TRAVIS: Of all the things to say-- (laughs)

3176
02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:14.229
LAURA: That's a good smell.
TRAVIS: And we all went there immediately.

3177
02:34:14.229 --> 02:34:19.221
(laughter)

3178
02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:21.910
ASHLEY: There's a reason for that and

3179
02:34:21.910 --> 02:34:24.340
a story I will tell you all later.

3180
02:34:24.340 --> 02:34:25.840
SAM: All right.
MARISHA: Why?

3181
02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.810
What?
LIAM: Deep backstory cut.

3182
02:34:27.810 --> 02:34:28.643
MARISHA: You--

3183
02:34:28.643 --> 02:34:31.100
(laughter)

3184
02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:32.970
ASHLEY: It's a deep story--

3185
02:34:32.970 --> 02:34:35.550
MARISHA: I kind of want to know.
Can you just tell us right now?

3186
02:34:35.550 --> 02:34:37.216
LAURA: On our way. We'll go get the bracers.

3187
02:34:37.216 --> 02:34:39.891
SAM: We're walking and talking, walking and talking.

3188
02:34:39.891 --> 02:34:42.380
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Um, yeah.

3189
02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:44.100
MATT: So as a group, you leave the house

3190
02:34:44.100 --> 02:34:46.110
and make the way towards the Marble Tomes Conservatory.

3191
02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:47.850
LIAM: Caleb, go, don't talk to me, but Caleb's going to

3192
02:34:47.850 --> 02:34:49.960
do research at home with the spell stuff.

3193
02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:51.340
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

3194
02:34:52.270 --> 02:34:53.103
Okay.

3195
02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:55.870
So you go ahead and make your way

3196
02:34:55.870 --> 02:34:58.590
towards the Marble Tomes Conservatory,

3197
02:34:58.590 --> 02:35:00.280
referring to a different clerk,

3198
02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:03.990
but within a short period of time, you are brought to

3199
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:07.380
the door of the familiar face of Enchanter Yun,

3200
02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:09.860
who steps out after being summoned.

3201
02:35:10.940 --> 02:35:11.920
"Oh, hello.

3202
02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:15.490
"There is quite a few people here, it appears.

3203
02:35:16.931 --> 02:35:19.131
"But you returned."
ASHLEY: Yes, I have returned.

3204
02:35:20.290 --> 02:35:24.360
I have returned and I came to pick up the bracers

3205
02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:26.510
if they are ready, but--
MATT: "They are ready."

3206
02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:29.900
ASHLEY: How much did I owe again?

3207
02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:31.420
Was it?
MATT: "Let me check."

3208
02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:32.253
ASHLEY: Okay.

3209
02:35:32.253 --> 02:35:33.810
MATT: He goes and slips back and you

3210
02:35:33.810 --> 02:35:35.910
look through the crack in the door.

3211
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:38.840
There's a bunch of shelves containing all sorts of

3212
02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:43.360
jars and various, you know, collected materials

3213
02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:45.820
that are probably used in the enchantment process

3214
02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:49.730
or the creation of various enchanted items.

3215
02:35:49.730 --> 02:35:51.456
Eventually he comes back, about a minute later,

3216
02:35:51.456 --> 02:35:53.520
and goes, "Here on the register,

3217
02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:56.420
"we have you still owing 2,000 gold pieces."

3218
02:35:56.420 --> 02:35:58.300
ASHLEY: Okay, that is what I thought.

3219
02:35:58.300 --> 02:35:59.170
Okay so,

3220
02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:03.260
I might not be ready to

3221
02:36:03.260 --> 02:36:04.640
pick them up just yet--
LAURA: She's ready, she's ready.

3222
02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:06.723
TALIESIN: She's absolutely ready.
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no.

3223
02:36:06.723 --> 02:36:08.160
I'm going to give you what I have,

3224
02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:09.190
which is, um,

3225
02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:12.836
I have, um,

3226
02:36:12.836 --> 02:36:16.110
here's 1,710 gold pieces.

3227
02:36:16.110 --> 02:36:19.030
LAURA: Here's 300, well, here's 200 more gold.

3228
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:22.674
MARISHA: And here's the other 110?

3229
02:36:22.674 --> 02:36:23.570
SAM and LAURA: Nope, nope.
ASHLEY: No, we don't--

3230
02:36:23.570 --> 02:36:25.500
MARISHA: 130.
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is all--

3231
02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:29.620
ASHLEY: 290 is left.
TALIESIN: Yep.

3232
02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:30.933
ASHLEY: I promise I'll--
LAURA: No, we paid it all.

3233
02:36:30.933 --> 02:36:33.080
That's everything, that's everything.

3234
02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:36.300
MATT: He just accepts all the gold and goes, "Very well.

3235
02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:38.050
"I will retrieve them for you now."

3236
02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:41.110
Leaves then comes back.

3237
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:43.410
The bracers that you had originally

3238
02:36:43.410 --> 02:36:45.260
commissioned provided as part of it--

3239
02:36:46.457 --> 02:36:50.330
ASHLEY: Oh wait, so I can use that.

3240
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:52.630
TALIESIN: It was counted in there, yeah.

3241
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:54.872
ASHLEY: I understand. Okay.

3242
02:36:54.872 --> 02:36:57.082
MATT: So, it returns with the bracers--
ASHLEY: I don't understand money.

3243
02:36:57.082 --> 02:36:57.998
MATT: It's okay.

3244
02:36:57.998 --> 02:36:59.668
As they were originally commissioned,

3245
02:36:59.668 --> 02:37:03.740
now you see they've been intricately designed upon.

3246
02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:05.320
There is all sorts of incredible

3247
02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:07.210
scrolling and shapes, it looks almost like

3248
02:37:07.210 --> 02:37:10.637
swirling flames across the sides of the metal.

3249
02:37:10.637 --> 02:37:12.830
TRAVIS: Sick.
MATT: They look beautiful.

3250
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:16.030
Polished, fresh, new, unworn.

3251
02:37:16.030 --> 02:37:19.400
And presents them to you and goes,

3252
02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:22.640
"Just to make sure you are aware,

3253
02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:27.640
"that equipment you are wearing with the horns,

3254
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:29.800
"they're not compatible together.

3255
02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:31.670
"You will have to, if you are intending

3256
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:33.480
"to use these yourself or you can give them to

3257
02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:38.130
"somebody else as a gift maybe, but just so you are aware."

3258
02:37:38.130 --> 02:37:39.700
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: "Of course."

3259
02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:41.710
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: "I'll,

3260
02:37:41.710 --> 02:37:42.876
"good day." (door clicks shut)

3261
02:37:43.915 --> 02:37:45.748
LAURA: What does your armor do?

3262
02:37:45.748 --> 02:37:47.960
I know it's, like, that armor

3263
02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:49.570
that you were made to wear before,

3264
02:37:49.570 --> 02:37:51.610
but is it like special armor or something?

3265
02:37:51.610 --> 02:37:53.370
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3266
02:37:53.370 --> 02:37:56.600
SAM: They sold what now?

3267
02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:59.230
MATT: Enchanter Yun. It doesn't sell things

3268
02:37:59.230 --> 02:38:03.734
necessarily as it is a, partially,

3269
02:38:03.734 --> 02:38:05.100
from what you would know,

3270
02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:06.460
and from Caleb's interaction there,

3271
02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:09.260
it's partially a conservatory for teaching

3272
02:38:09.260 --> 02:38:11.490
the enchantment and creation of magical items,

3273
02:38:11.490 --> 02:38:14.157
but they do commissions as well.

3274
02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:20.308
TRAVIS: What does it do, the bracers?

3275
02:38:21.610 --> 02:38:23.810
ASHLEY: I think they just,

3276
02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:29.381
protection, I don't, you know.

3277
02:38:29.381 --> 02:38:30.531
TRAVIS: Mm.
TALIESIN: Do we have a--

3278
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:35.786
Card, card, paper.

3279
02:38:35.786 --> 02:38:37.103
LAURA: Are they just bracers plus--

3280
02:38:37.103 --> 02:38:40.520
MATT: No, Bracers of Defense is what they are in D&amp;D Beyond.

3281
02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:45.244
TALIESIN: So, that would be--
MARISHA: That's what I have.

3282
02:38:45.244 --> 02:38:46.194
MATT: Correct.
ASHLEY: That is what you have?

3283
02:38:46.194 --> 02:38:48.410
MARISHA: Yeah, it gives a plus--

3284
02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:49.370
MATT: Plus two to your armor class.

3285
02:38:49.370 --> 02:38:50.680
MARISHA: Plus two.
LAURA: Tight.

3286
02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:52.400
MATT: As long as you're not wearing armor.

3287
02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:53.630
ASHLEY: As long as you're not wearing--

3288
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:55.080
TALIESIN: So what's your unarmored--

3289
02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:57.910
ASHLEY: Gosh, I wonder if somebody else should take these?

3290
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:59.660
TALIESIN: Oh, easy, easy way to see, actually,

3291
02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:03.870
is just go to your, it's just remove that.

3292
02:39:03.870 --> 02:39:04.820
MARISHA: That's all right.

3293
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:08.930
Oh, I took my--
TALIESIN: Remove.

3294
02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:11.880
Oh, just--
LAURA: So, it's the same.

3295
02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:13.010
ASHLEY: It's the same.

3296
02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:14.380
LAURA: But now you don't have to wear that

3297
02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:16.980
awful armor that Obann made you wear.

3298
02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:19.240
MARISHA: Is that why you smell like a crayon?

3299
02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:22.190
Is it the armor?
ASHLEY: I don't think so, I think--

3300
02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:27.190
MARISHA: Why do you smell like a crayon?

3301
02:39:28.420 --> 02:39:29.530
ASHLEY: Gosh, I don't know what to do.

3302
02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:30.546
TRAVIS: Does she have that funky thing where if she

3303
02:39:30.546 --> 02:39:32.385
wears no armor, her AC's higher,

3304
02:39:32.385 --> 02:39:33.893
unarmored--
MATT: Depends.

3305
02:39:33.893 --> 02:39:35.340
She gets to add her dexterity

3306
02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:37.540
and her constitution modifier without armor.

3307
02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:39.583
LAURA: Mm.
TALIESIN: Oh.

3308
02:39:39.583 --> 02:39:40.416
MATT: Is how it works.

3309
02:39:40.416 --> 02:39:42.380
LAURA: So it's way better without armor.

3310
02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:43.350
MATT: Well, it depends on how high

3311
02:39:43.350 --> 02:39:45.100
your dexterity and constitution is.

3312
02:39:47.410 --> 02:39:48.860
ASHLEY: I need to think about this.

3313
02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:51.853
TALIESIN: Well, the other--
LAURA: Well,

3314
02:39:51.853 --> 02:39:54.630
plus the bracers you'll go back up to 17.

3315
02:39:55.779 --> 02:39:58.030
ASHLEY: Yeah, they're both the same.

3316
02:39:58.030 --> 02:40:02.180
This one, this is, this is--
LAURA: Does other stuff, though?

3317
02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:04.240
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: That's true.

3318
02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:08.790
ASHLEY: I need to think about this for a second.

3319
02:40:12.751 --> 02:40:16.220
Yeah, I need to think about this for a little bit.

3320
02:40:16.220 --> 02:40:20.220
TRAVIS: Caduceus, is there anything we need to

3321
02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:24.850
pick up on our, as we prepare to voyage?

3322
02:40:24.850 --> 02:40:28.230
We obviously have to go back and get
Caleb and stuff, but I mean, do you have a--

3323
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:30.870
TALIESIN: Never say no to a diamond, but other than that--

3324
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:33.590
LAURA: That's true, we could use some diamonds.

3325
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:34.957
SAM: How many?

3326
02:40:34.957 --> 02:40:36.510
LAURA: As many as we can find.

3327
02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:37.610
SAM: Could probably steal some.
LAURA: Because, you know,

3328
02:40:37.610 --> 02:40:41.000
we, they have to be good diamonds, Nott,

3329
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.840
they can't just be little dinky diamonds.

3330
02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:44.550
SAM: Give me two hours.

3331
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:48.520
LAURA: We need a 300 and a 500 worth.

3332
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:52.221
SAM: I'll go buy them. (laughs)

3333
02:40:52.221 --> 02:40:53.537
LAURA: Aww.

3334
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:56.030
SAM: I guess.

3335
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:58.660
MATT: Do you want to go on a shopping trip on your lonesome?

3336
02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:00.395
TRAVIS: Do you want some company?
SAM: Sure.

3337
02:41:00.395 --> 02:41:02.857
TRAVIS: I'll go with her.
MATT: All righty.

3338
02:41:04.850 --> 02:41:06.340
Looking for diamonds.

3339
02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:07.647
Easy enough to find.

3340
02:41:07.647 --> 02:41:11.447
You return to an individual

3341
02:41:11.447 --> 02:41:13.979
known as Besh Turmin,

3342
02:41:13.979 --> 02:41:17.247
who we had previously had an encounter with.

3343
02:41:18.548 --> 02:41:21.770
If you'd like to go to the Turmin's Tinctures and Tonics.

3344
02:41:21.770 --> 02:41:25.540
You return to this unique shop

3345
02:41:25.540 --> 02:41:28.880
run by a duergar figure.

3346
02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:32.760
Stocky, red crew cut figure

3347
02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:35.160
with this giant (wheezes) of a red beard,

3348
02:41:36.232 --> 02:41:37.065
dark duergar skin.

3349
02:41:37.065 --> 02:41:41.453
As you walk in, he goes like, "Hey, can I help you?"

3350
02:41:41.453 --> 02:41:46.453
SAM: Oh hi, um, you're a jeweler, correct?

3351
02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:50.930
MATT: "No, but I can get you jewels?"

3352
02:41:50.930 --> 02:41:55.430
SAM: That's all we need.
TRAVIS: We're returning patrons.

3353
02:41:55.430 --> 02:41:56.760
SAM: Yes, we've been here--
MATT: "Right, right.

3354
02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:59.601
"I recognize you, okay."

3355
02:41:59.601 --> 02:42:01.510
SAM: What's your name again? I'm sorry.
MATT: "Besh."

3356
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:03.100
SAM: Besh, that's right, Besh, Besh.

3357
02:42:03.100 --> 02:42:04.890
MATT: "But you can just call me Turmin.

3358
02:42:04.890 --> 02:42:07.485
"That's what most folks say."
SAM: Is that your last name?

3359
02:42:07.485 --> 02:42:09.985
MATT: "Aye."
SAM: Oh, Besh Turmin.

3360
02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:15.930
Yes, we're interested in some fine jewels.

3361
02:42:15.930 --> 02:42:18.440
MATT: "So, how much you looking for?"
SAM: Two diamonds.

3362
02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:23.310
MATT: "How big?"
SAM: Like, a this and a that.

3363
02:42:23.310 --> 02:42:25.130
MATT: You point out the specific sizes

3364
02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:26.938
that previous spells have used.

3365
02:42:26.938 --> 02:42:27.980
They're not too big,

3366
02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:30.960
they're not like giant, handheld things.

3367
02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:32.850
"Okay, I'll have to ask around.

3368
02:42:32.850 --> 02:42:36.100
"Might take a few hours, but I can look into it."

3369
02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:37.720
SAM: Oh, you don't have them on site.

3370
02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:40.380
MATT: "No, I'm not a jeweler,
but I know people who are jewelers

3371
02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:42.150
"that I can get those for you, lickety split."

3372
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:46.518
SAM: So, you're a middleman.
MATT: "Aye, for certain things."

3373
02:42:46.518 --> 02:42:47.710
SAM: We could just go straight to

3374
02:42:47.710 --> 02:42:49.730
the jeweler, then, maybe get--

3375
02:42:49.730 --> 02:42:52.230
MATT: "Do you know where the jewelers are?"

3376
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:54.420
SAM: I don't, but if you told me where they were.

3377
02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:55.860
MATT: "But then I'd be screwing myself

3378
02:42:55.860 --> 02:42:56.840
"out of some coin, wouldn't I?"

3379
02:42:56.840 --> 02:42:59.412
TRAVIS: This gentleman's connections are worth the coin.

3380
02:42:59.412 --> 02:43:02.183
MATT: "Ah, that's a smart little half-orc, eh?"

3381
02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:04.430
TRAVIS: Not little, all right?

3382
02:43:04.430 --> 02:43:07.570
I ran five miles this morning, it's a process.

3383
02:43:07.570 --> 02:43:09.170
MATT: "Congratulations."
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3384
02:43:09.170 --> 02:43:11.520
I think we should pay this gentleman.

3385
02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:13.740
SAM: Do we have to pay now or upon delivery?

3386
02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:16.348
MATT: "You can pay now if you want to, but--"

3387
02:43:16.348 --> 02:43:18.730
SAM: "How about later?"
MATT: "On pick up, all right.

3388
02:43:18.730 --> 02:43:20.070
"I'll see what I can find."

3389
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:21.370
SAM: Thank you.
MATT: "No worries.

3390
02:43:21.370 --> 02:43:22.203
"And if they're not to your interest,

3391
02:43:22.203 --> 02:43:25.830
"we've got all sorts of delightful tonics and balms

3392
02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:28.920
"and salves and things to help with indigestion,

3393
02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:32.410
"we've got things to-- got all sorts of things,"

3394
02:43:32.410 --> 02:43:33.790
and he starts just pointing across the room

3395
02:43:33.790 --> 02:43:35.920
and there's just these little labels on them and--

3396
02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:39.340
TRAVIS: Is it a he, she?
MATT: It's a he.

3397
02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:40.540
From what you can tell.

3398
02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:43.520
SAM: Those are potions that you have, right, Fjord?

3399
02:43:44.530 --> 02:43:45.771
TRAVIS: All of these?

3400
02:43:45.771 --> 02:43:48.238
LAURA: Yeah, those are ours.
SAM: Do you own those?

3401
02:43:48.238 --> 02:43:51.300
TRAVIS: No, I believe they belong to the group.

3402
02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:53.190
SAM: But, I mean, have you passed them out?

3403
02:43:54.631 --> 02:43:56.870
TRAVIS: I don't think so.
MATT: I don't think so, or you guys

3404
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:57.858
could consolidate it right now.
SAM: We don't need any more

3405
02:43:57.858 --> 02:43:58.982
is what I'm saying.
TRAVIS: All mine.

3406
02:43:58.982 --> 02:44:00.682
TRAVIS: Nope, we're good.

3407
02:44:00.682 --> 02:44:04.010
SAM: Any magical potions or magical oils?

3408
02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:08.680
MATT: "Eh, I, most of it's topical.

3409
02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:10.680
"You know, folks here don't get a whole lot of sunlight,

3410
02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:13.610
"so for those that wants it, I got a few things to help

3411
02:44:13.610 --> 02:44:16.290
"just get some good vitamins in the top surface.

3412
02:44:17.930 --> 02:44:20.510
"Let's see, yeah, things magical."

3413
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:24.380
TRAVIS: Some vitamin D rub.
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

3414
02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:26.160
"I got some willowshade oil."

3415
02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:27.576
SAM: What's that do? What's that?

3416
02:44:27.576 --> 02:44:29.701
MATT: "It's a very rare fruit.

3417
02:44:29.701 --> 02:44:32.090
"It come from the willowshade plant.

3418
02:44:32.090 --> 02:44:34.090
"It's harvested far to the west.

3419
02:44:35.540 --> 02:44:37.480
"I think Feolinn,

3420
02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:41.120
"on the Menagerie Coast, I had it sent over.

3421
02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:43.760
"This, when you put it on, you want to put it on

3422
02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:45.800
"in advance if you want to, a little bit,

3423
02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:47.060
"I'm sure it feel a bit tingly,

3424
02:44:47.060 --> 02:44:49.500
"but there are things and dangers out there

3425
02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:52.690
"that make your skin get all cracky and turn to stone.

3426
02:44:52.690 --> 02:44:55.013
"Supposedly it helps with that."

3427
02:44:55.013 --> 02:44:57.897
SAM: It helps against things that turn your skin to stone.

3428
02:44:57.897 --> 02:44:58.963
LAURA: (gasping)
MATT: "I think so."

3429
02:44:58.963 --> 02:45:02.670
LAURA: We were looking for basilisk oil, remember?

3430
02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:07.110
You should get it. (coos)
SAM: Is it basilisk oil?

3431
02:45:07.110 --> 02:45:09.010
MATT: "No, it's from a fruit."

3432
02:45:09.010 --> 02:45:11.105
LAURA: It helps against being petrified.
TRAVIS: It's in like an açaí berry,

3433
02:45:11.105 --> 02:45:12.688
it's all the craze right now.

3434
02:45:12.688 --> 02:45:14.050
SAM: How much does that cost?

3435
02:45:14.050 --> 02:45:17.950
MATT: "I've got two and it's 40 gold a piece."

3436
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:19.540
SAM: Oh, that seems reasonable.

3437
02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:21.857
Fjord, pay the gentleman.
TRAVIS: You got it.

3438
02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:24.420
Boop.
MATT: "80 gold,

3439
02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:26.020
"thank you very much."

3440
02:45:26.020 --> 02:45:28.310
SAM: Willow wisp, what is it?
LAURA: Willowbark.

3441
02:45:28.310 --> 02:45:29.730
Willow--
MATT: "Willowshade oil."

3442
02:45:29.730 --> 02:45:31.170
SAM: Willowshade oil.
MATT: You got

3443
02:45:31.170 --> 02:45:32.520
two of those you can mark.

3444
02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:34.976
SAM: Great.
LAURA: Willowshade oil.

3445
02:45:34.976 --> 02:45:36.830
TRAVIS: Look at that, that's cool.

3446
02:45:36.830 --> 02:45:39.780
SAM: Thank you, we'll see you in a few hours.

3447
02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:40.613
MATT: "Aye, aye."

3448
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:43.480
LAURA: While they're off doing that,

3449
02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:46.090
I'm going to search out somewhere

3450
02:45:46.090 --> 02:45:49.400
to look for something like beard oil,

3451
02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:51.942
something that can make beards grow.

3452
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:55.403
TALIESIN: Magic beard oil?

3453
02:45:56.800 --> 02:45:59.530
MATT: Go ahead and make--
TALIESIN: Can't make beards grow in D&amp;D, everyone.

3454
02:45:59.530 --> 02:46:01.530
MATT: Make an investigation check, I'll say.

3455
02:46:03.722 --> 02:46:06.712
LAURA: Eight.
LIAM: Have you heard the tale of Grog Strongjaw?

3456
02:46:06.712 --> 02:46:07.545
MARISHA: Yeah.

3457
02:46:09.210 --> 02:46:12.840
MATT: About 20 minutes after they leave

3458
02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:15.770
Turmin's Tinctures and Tonics.
LAURA: Figured as much. (laughs)

3459
02:46:15.770 --> 02:46:17.270
MATT: You end up in the same place.

3460
02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:19.520
"Hi, can I help you?"
LAURA: Hi, yes.

3461
02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:23.350
I am looking for some, like, oil or something

3462
02:46:23.350 --> 02:46:24.960
you put on your face to make a beard

3463
02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:27.540
grow better.
MATT: "Aye?

3464
02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:29.940
"That we've got."
LAURA: Oh, really?

3465
02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:32.200
MATT: "Aye, depends how many
applications you're looking for,

3466
02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:36.090
"but we've got some in big vials, small vials, all sorts.

3467
02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:38.000
"Sorry, it's my assistant.

3468
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:39.900
"She's delivering snacks for the time being."

3469
02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:41.130
LAURA: Oh, wonderful.

3470
02:46:41.130 --> 02:46:43.798
What kind of snacks?
MATT: "Well, they're not for you."

3471
02:46:43.798 --> 02:46:44.852
MARISHA: I don't feel like I should've

3472
02:46:44.852 --> 02:46:46.280
brought these doughnuts right here.

3473
02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:48.373
MATT: "But how much you looking for?

3474
02:46:48.373 --> 02:46:49.966
"Would you like a big vial?"

3475
02:46:49.966 --> 02:46:52.700
LAURA: I don't know, it's just for one person's beard.

3476
02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:54.230
But I don't know how much work it's going to

3477
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:56.924
take to really get it to grow, you know.

3478
02:46:56.924 --> 02:47:01.520
MATT: "Are they perhaps a duergar?"

3479
02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:03.480
LAURA: No.
MATT: "Oh, it's going to be

3480
02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:06.410
"a tough push for a beard then, no matter who they are.

3481
02:47:06.410 --> 02:47:08.440
"I'd recommend getting a larger vial."

3482
02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:10.730
LAURA: How much is that?
MATT: "That would be,

3483
02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:13.440
"it's somewhere around 100 to 150 applications

3484
02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:15.518
"and it takes about, standard,

3485
02:47:15.518 --> 02:47:19.580
"non-duergar lineage individuals,

3486
02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:21.400
"about half that amount to grow a full beard

3487
02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:24.150
"in a short period of time, so I'd say that

3488
02:47:24.150 --> 02:47:27.830
"puts you about, ah, 55 gold."

3489
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:28.960
LAURA: And then, like, what do they do?

3490
02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:31.130
Like, put it on, like three times a day or like?

3491
02:47:31.130 --> 02:47:32.120
MATT: "In the morning when they wake up

3492
02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:33.474
"and at night before they go to sleep."

3493
02:47:33.474 --> 02:47:34.807
TRAVIS: (wheezing laughter)

3494
02:47:34.807 --> 02:47:35.640
LAURA: Okay.

3495
02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:38.160
And then, so how long will it take to grow a beard then?

3496
02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:40.010
MATT: "Depends on who it is, but it'll be

3497
02:47:40.010 --> 02:47:42.655
"thrice as fast as it would be normally.

3498
02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:45.790
"Most likely."

3499
02:47:45.790 --> 02:47:47.780
LAURA: Or it could just be like a normal beard growth

3500
02:47:47.780 --> 02:47:50.880
because isn't that how long it normally takes?

3501
02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:52.880
I don't know, I don't have a beard.

3502
02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:54.888
MATT: "Trust me."

3503
02:47:54.888 --> 02:47:55.888
LAURA: Okay!

3504
02:47:55.888 --> 02:47:56.782
All right.

3505
02:47:56.782 --> 02:47:59.057
(laughter)

3506
02:47:59.057 --> 02:48:00.920
50 gold, you said?
MATT: "55."

3507
02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:02.711
LAURA: 55.

3508
02:48:03.650 --> 02:48:05.482
TALIESIN: This could definitely end well.

3509
02:48:05.482 --> 02:48:08.030
LAURA: I get a giant vial of oil.

3510
02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:09.090
MATT: Of beard oil.

3511
02:48:09.090 --> 02:48:11.630
LIAM: God, the juxtaposition to Vex is just stellar.

3512
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:13.972
TALIESIN: So great, isn't it?

3513
02:48:13.972 --> 02:48:16.216
TRAVIS: (like Jester) Okay!

3514
02:48:16.216 --> 02:48:17.957
LIAM: (chicken cluck)
TALIESIN: This is fine.

3515
02:48:17.957 --> 02:48:19.230
LAURA: Beard oil.

3516
02:48:19.230 --> 02:48:21.693
Thank you so much.
MATT: "Of course, any time.

3517
02:48:21.693 --> 02:48:23.230
"If you need more of that, if you've got more friends

3518
02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:25.656
"who's trying to grow out something fancy like this,

3519
02:48:25.656 --> 02:48:29.021
"(laughs) you let me know."
LAURA: Okay.

3520
02:48:29.021 --> 02:48:30.870
MATT: While this is happening,
you're doing your research, Caleb.

3521
02:48:30.870 --> 02:48:33.186
Go ahead and roll an arcana check.
LIAM: Yeah, this is on, oh,

3522
02:48:33.186 --> 02:48:35.900
I've already cast Fortune's Favor on myself.

3523
02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:37.020
MATT: All righty.

3524
02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:40.020
LIAM: So this is for Nott's problem.

3525
02:48:41.035 --> 02:48:44.250
TRAVIS: A burning wind of peace?
LIAM: Yes.

3526
02:48:44.250 --> 02:48:46.590
And here goes Fortune's Favor, see if I can do better.

3527
02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:50.318
Both 13, so that is a 23.

3528
02:48:50.318 --> 02:48:53.901
TRAVIS: That's the worst, when--
MATT: A 23?

3529
02:48:57.040 --> 02:48:59.750
You get to a point in this equation where you begin to

3530
02:48:59.750 --> 02:49:04.733
see the light at the end of the tunnel in its design.

3531
02:49:06.090 --> 02:49:08.160
Elements of it are still escaping you a bit

3532
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:09.890
and the materials that are going to be needed

3533
02:49:09.890 --> 02:49:13.836
to experiment with the development of this

3534
02:49:13.836 --> 02:49:15.700
is going to start getting a little,

3535
02:49:15.700 --> 02:49:17.140
start costing you some money.

3536
02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:18.030
While they're in this, you could

3537
02:49:18.030 --> 02:49:19.140
rush out and pick up supplies.

3538
02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:20.770
I'd say to continue this thread,

3539
02:49:20.770 --> 02:49:23.550
it would cost you about 250 gold pieces

3540
02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:25.220
to get everything you need to experiment

3541
02:49:25.220 --> 02:49:28.240
with this next portion of the equation.

3542
02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:31.907
LIAM: I will do that, I will go
running out helter skelter, papers--

3543
02:49:31.907 --> 02:49:33.520
MATT: Easy enough to find based on the materials

3544
02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:35.240
you've already tried to gather in this city.

3545
02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:36.940
You come back, slam the door shut.

3546
02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:39.570
You're in that obsessive Beautiful Mind mode.

3547
02:49:39.570 --> 02:49:41.360
TRAVIS: What's wrong, big guy?

3548
02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:43.655
MATT: Focusing on it.
LIAM: Magic stuff!

3549
02:49:43.655 --> 02:49:48.000
(laughter)

3550
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:52.384
MATT: Continuing to push towards its development,

3551
02:49:52.384 --> 02:49:53.230
it's getting close.

3552
02:49:53.230 --> 02:49:54.630
And there's that element of, like,

3553
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:55.650
a breakthrough around the corner

3554
02:49:55.650 --> 02:49:58.530
that's bothering you because it's eluding you.

3555
02:49:58.530 --> 02:49:59.800
But you can sense it now.

3556
02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:01.480
You know you're not terribly far off

3557
02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:03.880
from a design completion.

3558
02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:05.820
As to whether or not it will succeed, who knows,

3559
02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:08.640
and what path'll get you, it'll take for you to get there.

3560
02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:10.130
But that's about as far as you can

3561
02:50:10.130 --> 02:50:11.270
reach with your morning attempt.

3562
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:12.370
LIAM: Got it, great, good.

3563
02:50:13.330 --> 02:50:17.129
SAM: Two more sessions and I'm back.

3564
02:50:17.129 --> 02:50:18.980
I'm calling it right now.
LAURA: Oh my god.

3565
02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:22.240
MATT: All right, so. The rest of you?

3566
02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:24.770
MARISHA: Are you going to call it, like, Nott's Proof?

3567
02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:26.700
Name it after Nott's equation?

3568
02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:28.646
LIAM: Nott's Berry Farm.

3569
02:50:28.646 --> 02:50:30.930
(laughter)

3570
02:50:30.930 --> 02:50:34.056
MATT: So you guys have gathered your things.

3571
02:50:34.056 --> 02:50:35.273
If there's anything else you want to try and accomplish

3572
02:50:35.273 --> 02:50:38.799
in Rosohna, otherwise you can return to the Xhorhaus.

3573
02:50:38.799 --> 02:50:39.982
TRAVIS: Good to return.

3574
02:50:39.982 --> 02:50:43.630
MARISHA: I've got something with
Caduceus because I went home.

3575
02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:45.410
You want me to help you pack?

3576
02:50:45.410 --> 02:50:47.720
TALIESIN: I'm just upstairs.
MARISHA: Do you need anything?

3577
02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:49.130
TALIESIN: Taking care of the trees, making sure

3578
02:50:49.130 --> 02:50:50.970
the plants are all right, picking anything

3579
02:50:50.970 --> 02:50:52.590
I want to bring with me.
MARISHA: I can help you.

3580
02:50:52.590 --> 02:50:55.380
I am so fucking bored.

3581
02:50:55.380 --> 02:50:58.280
Let me do something, please, for the love of gods.

3582
02:50:58.280 --> 02:50:59.113
TALIESIN: You're bored?

3583
02:50:59.113 --> 02:51:00.790
MARISHA: Yeah.

3584
02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:02.348
TALIESIN: Well, it's good, it builds character.

3585
02:51:02.348 --> 02:51:03.510
Yeah, come on in.
MARISHA: Okay.

3586
02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:05.870
TALIESIN: Just going to garden for a little while.

3587
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:07.830
MARISHA: Garden.
MATT: So you guys garden a bit.

3588
02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:11.040
SAM: Go back in a few hours, see if the diamonds are ready.

3589
02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:14.060
MATT: There is one diamond worth 300 gold

3590
02:51:15.470 --> 02:51:18.370
and there is one worth 50 gold, smaller one.

3591
02:51:20.087 --> 02:51:21.640
SAM: Doesn't help us.

3592
02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:24.470
TALIESIN: 300.
SAM: I'll take the 300.

3593
02:51:24.470 --> 02:51:26.303
MATT: "Ooh, all right then.

3594
02:51:26.303 --> 02:51:30.205
"And the smaller one? It's perfect
for tiny jewels and gifts."

3595
02:51:30.205 --> 02:51:31.821
SAM: It is really nice.

3596
02:51:31.821 --> 02:51:33.279
MATT: "That it is."

3597
02:51:34.670 --> 02:51:36.080
SAM: 50 gold, it's just a,

3598
02:51:36.080 --> 02:51:38.930
like a little one?

3599
02:51:38.930 --> 02:51:40.446
MATT: "Ah, look at it."

3600
02:51:40.446 --> 02:51:42.170
It's a little one,

3601
02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:44.462
little grain of diamond.

3602
02:51:44.462 --> 02:51:45.295
SAM: Wonder if I have--

3603
02:51:45.295 --> 02:51:46.580
if only Jester were here, she could

3604
02:51:46.580 --> 02:51:48.360
tell me if that's useful.

3605
02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:51.080
I'll take that one, too.
MATT: "There you go."

3606
02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:51.913
SAM: 350?

3607
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:54.030
All right.
MATT: Mmkay.

3608
02:51:56.370 --> 02:51:57.203
SAM: Done.

3609
02:51:57.203 --> 02:51:59.890
Bye. Thank you, Beth. Besh.

3610
02:51:59.890 --> 02:52:02.110
Besh Turmin.
MATT: "Turmin, just go Turmin."

3611
02:52:02.110 --> 02:52:03.410
TRAVIS: Yeah, bish.
LIAM: Let's go, Besh.

3612
02:52:03.410 --> 02:52:05.630
ASHLEY: Let's go, Besh.
SAM: Cash me outside.

3613
02:52:07.710 --> 02:52:10.090
MATT: While you guys are returning,

3614
02:52:10.090 --> 02:52:12.508
a voice comes to your mind, Jester.

3615
02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:17.570
"This is Ludinus."

3616
02:52:17.570 --> 02:52:18.913
LIAM: Oh shit.

3617
02:52:19.820 --> 02:52:22.930
MATT: "To notify that Vence

3618
02:52:22.930 --> 02:52:26.593
"has been found and incarcerated.

3619
02:52:26.593 --> 02:52:28.760
(gasping)

3620
02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:31.810
"Interrogations will progress.

3621
02:52:34.290 --> 02:52:36.738
"The negotiation is accepted."

3622
02:52:38.420 --> 02:52:40.690
A follow up message continues this thread:

3623
02:52:43.570 --> 02:52:45.160
"The perceived transgressions of

3624
02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:47.377
"The Mighty Nein have been absolved.

3625
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:55.090
"The negotiation is outlined to occur in four weeks.

3626
02:52:55.454 --> 02:52:57.470
LAURA: Whoa.
LIAM: Cutting it close to Traveler Con.

3627
02:52:57.470 --> 02:52:59.560
MATT: Third message comes through:

3628
02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:03.230
"Prolonging the ceasefire as the naval forces

3629
02:53:03.230 --> 02:53:06.783
"on both sides are gathered and outfitted for travel."

3630
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:09.580
Additional message:

3631
02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:12.280
"To the agreed upon neutral location

3632
02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:13.655
"in the Lucidian Ocean."

3633
02:53:16.890 --> 02:53:19.770
That's the completion of the update.

3634
02:53:19.770 --> 02:53:20.886
MARISHA: Wow.

3635
02:53:20.886 --> 02:53:22.611
LAURA: I tell everyone all of it.

3636
02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:26.790
LIAM: Get in, loser, we're torturing people.

3637
02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:31.640
MARISHA: Four weeks.
LAURA: Four weeks.

3638
02:53:31.640 --> 02:53:33.090
MARISHA: When was Traveler Con, five?

3639
02:53:33.090 --> 02:53:34.190
LAURA: Five weeks-ish.

3640
02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:35.470
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: It's close by.

3641
02:53:35.470 --> 02:53:38.750
MARISHA: We go, we do that, and then (snaps) our reward,

3642
02:53:38.750 --> 02:53:40.760
our vacation, is Traveler Con.

3643
02:53:40.760 --> 02:53:41.970
SAM: Yeah, it's perfect.
LAURA: Okay.

3644
02:53:41.970 --> 02:53:43.480
MARISHA: It's dope.
SAM: But we should start

3645
02:53:43.480 --> 02:53:46.140
heading down that way now--
TALIESIN: Get the boat.

3646
02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:47.910
SAM: -- in case we get waylaid.

3647
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:49.090
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3648
02:53:49.090 --> 02:53:50.767
SAM: Oh, by the way, here's a diamond.

3649
02:53:50.767 --> 02:53:52.463
LAURA: Oh, sweet.
SAM: What can that do?

3650
02:53:52.463 --> 02:53:53.320
Can that--?

3651
02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:54.940
LAURA: Well, the 300 gold, that can

3652
02:53:54.940 --> 02:53:56.580
bring somebody back to life is what it can do.

3653
02:53:56.580 --> 02:53:58.290
SAM: Good, the debt is repaid.

3654
02:53:58.290 --> 02:54:00.698
Thank you for saving my life before.

3655
02:54:02.154 --> 02:54:03.690
LAURA: Well, you don't, it's not a debt.

3656
02:54:03.690 --> 02:54:05.310
SAM: Well, it is, and I know it's not

3657
02:54:05.310 --> 02:54:07.018
because I just paid it back.

3658
02:54:07.018 --> 02:54:09.990
(laughter)

3659
02:54:09.990 --> 02:54:11.520
LAURA: Do you have a diamond already?

3660
02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:13.940
TALIESIN: I have a 350, so if you have a--

3661
02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:15.890
LAURA: I only have a 500.

3662
02:54:15.890 --> 02:54:18.090
TALIESIN: So you need a three, take another 350, then.

3663
02:54:18.090 --> 02:54:19.700
LAURA: I'll take the 300 one.

3664
02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:21.270
TALIESIN: It's a 350 diamond, right?

3665
02:54:21.270 --> 02:54:24.180
MATT: 300 gold diamond and then a 50 gold diamond.

3666
02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:26.030
LAURA: Oh, you don't need the other 50 gold diamond.

3667
02:54:26.030 --> 02:54:27.696
We don't know what that does yet.
SAM: I'm keeping the 50.

3668
02:54:27.696 --> 02:54:29.362
LAURA: Yeah, okay.
TALIESIN: Oh come on, where is it?

3669
02:54:29.362 --> 02:54:30.830
SAM: Unless you need it?
LAURA: No.

3670
02:54:30.830 --> 02:54:31.663
SAM: Yeah, that's mine.

3671
02:54:31.663 --> 02:54:33.426
TRAVIS: Nott smiles real big and just.

3672
02:54:33.426 --> 02:54:35.180
(laughter)

3673
02:54:35.180 --> 02:54:37.279
SAM: It's just shoved in between two teeth.

3674
02:54:37.279 --> 02:54:39.190
(laughter)

3675
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:41.140
Like it?
MARISHA: It looks infected.

3676
02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:42.870
I don't--

3677
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:43.753
Oh no.

3678
02:54:43.753 --> 02:54:45.920
LIAM: Tattooed, grill on.

3679
02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:46.970
MATT: As you return, Caleb has been

3680
02:54:46.970 --> 02:54:50.180
shut into his research facility

3681
02:54:50.180 --> 02:54:52.420
and you can hear the clattering around.

3682
02:54:52.420 --> 02:54:55.850
You are in that mad place of

3683
02:54:55.850 --> 02:54:57.600
close, but there's a blockage and you're

3684
02:54:57.600 --> 02:54:58.760
trying desperately to find

3685
02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:01.468
a way around that inspiration block.

3686
02:55:01.468 --> 02:55:03.942
LIAM: (door slams) Come here!
SAM: Ah!

3687
02:55:03.942 --> 02:55:05.720
LIAM: I pull her in and I start dancing around.

3688
02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:08.320
Look at this, look at this, look here.

3689
02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:11.090
I spent a couple of hours and then I ran out

3690
02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:13.280
and I had to bring some components back.

3691
02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:18.190
And I bypassed the hold that was keeping it from, you know,

3692
02:55:18.190 --> 02:55:20.840
from locking in place and I can't do it yet,

3693
02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:25.430
but I think I know a way that I could know, but not yet.

3694
02:55:25.430 --> 02:55:27.165
Does that make sense?
SAM: Doc, doc, doc.

3695
02:55:27.165 --> 02:55:28.840
(laughter)

3696
02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:30.840
TALIESIN: Caleb, were you eating those?

3697
02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:33.530
Because that was a baking experiment gone horribly wrong.

3698
02:55:33.530 --> 02:55:35.860
I used way too much sugar.
LIAM: Those cookies are fantastic!

3699
02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:38.260
TRAVIS: Marty!
LIAM: More of them!

3700
02:55:38.260 --> 02:55:40.023
SAM: This is just--
ASHLEY: Great Nott!

3701
02:55:40.023 --> 02:55:41.728
(laughter)
TRAVIS: "Great Nott."

3702
02:55:41.728 --> 02:55:46.061
(cheering)

3703
02:55:46.061 --> 02:55:47.725
MARISHA: That was good one.

3704
02:55:48.610 --> 02:55:50.710
TALIESIN: Yep, yep, go for it.

3705
02:55:50.710 --> 02:55:53.590
MARISHA: Doughnut reward.
LIAM: 1.21 giga-Notts!

3706
02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:55.587
(laughter)

3707
02:55:55.587 --> 02:55:57.691
SAM: The Libyans?

3708
02:55:57.691 --> 02:56:00.082
(laughter)

3709
02:56:00.082 --> 02:56:01.760
SAM: All right. This is amazing.

3710
02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:02.593
Thank you, Caleb.

3711
02:56:02.593 --> 02:56:05.842
LIAM: But the end result is that I don't know how it works.

3712
02:56:05.842 --> 02:56:07.341
SAM: Oh.
LIAM: But I--

3713
02:56:07.341 --> 02:56:08.191
SAM: All right.

3714
02:56:08.191 --> 02:56:09.416
LIAM: You know how these things go.

3715
02:56:09.416 --> 02:56:10.920
SAM: No, but that's, this is progress.

3716
02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:13.240
We're so close. You're so close.

3717
02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:15.272
LIAM: <i>You</i> are so close.

3718
02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:19.340
SAM: Great.
MARISHA: That's what she said, ha.

3719
02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:21.702
Ha ha ha.
TALIESIN: I don't get it.

3720
02:56:21.702 --> 02:56:23.726
TRAVIS: This is pretty important.
MARISHA: Is it?

3721
02:56:23.726 --> 02:56:27.700
TRAVIS: Walk out here with me.
MARISHA: Ugh.

3722
02:56:27.700 --> 02:56:28.800
LIAM: Cup her by the face.

3723
02:56:30.325 --> 02:56:32.670
A little bit longer, a little bit longer,

3724
02:56:32.670 --> 02:56:36.680
maybe Essek, he'll help me, we will have it.

3725
02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:37.980
SAM: All right, all right.

3726
02:56:37.980 --> 02:56:39.013
LIAM: Do you believe me?

3727
02:56:39.013 --> 02:56:40.950
SAM: Of course I believe you, yes.

3728
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:42.812
LIAM: Good.
SAM: Thank you.

3729
02:56:42.812 --> 02:56:44.203
LIAM: (doors closing)
SAM: Oh!

3730
02:56:44.203 --> 02:56:45.890
LIAM: Shuts himself in.

3731
02:56:45.890 --> 02:56:47.550
MARISHA: Wait.
TALIESIN: We have-- oh.

3732
02:56:47.550 --> 02:56:51.100
MARISHA: Ah, we were going to go.
SAM: Oh yeah, but we're leaving.

3733
02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:53.502
LIAM: I need an hour!
SAM: Okay.

3734
02:56:53.502 --> 02:56:54.570
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, in an hour.

3735
02:56:54.570 --> 02:56:56.890
I'm just going to run out to the store

3736
02:56:56.890 --> 02:56:58.210
and see if I can find somewhere where

3737
02:56:58.210 --> 02:57:00.352
I can buy a bunch of green cloaks. (laughs)

3738
02:57:00.352 --> 02:57:02.510
(laughter)

3739
02:57:02.510 --> 02:57:03.343
MATT: Sure.

3740
02:57:03.343 --> 02:57:04.770
How many green cloaks do you want to buy?

3741
02:57:04.770 --> 02:57:06.300
LAURA: Like, as many as they have.

3742
02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:09.638
TALIESIN: Every green cloak in the kingdom!

3743
02:57:09.638 --> 02:57:11.632
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Where's the supply sergeant?

3744
02:57:11.632 --> 02:57:12.564
Army/Navy surplus.

3745
02:57:12.564 --> 02:57:13.593
LAURA: I don't know if it's like a store

3746
02:57:13.593 --> 02:57:15.832
where it's a bunch of like-- you know when you go to

3747
02:57:15.832 --> 02:57:17.870
the ren faire and there's all a bunch of--

3748
02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:18.703
TALIESIN: The green cloak store?

3749
02:57:18.703 --> 02:57:19.880
LAURA: Yeah, the green cloak section.

3750
02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:21.741
MATT: Yeah, okay.

3751
02:57:21.741 --> 02:57:23.322
I'll say--

3752
02:57:23.322 --> 02:57:25.740
LAURA: Or just a bunch of green fabric, I can do that, too.

3753
02:57:25.740 --> 02:57:27.140
MATT: Green fabric is easier.

3754
02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:30.700
Cloaks, you can find a dozen. 12 green cloaks

3755
02:57:30.700 --> 02:57:34.183
of slightly varying shades, but all green.

3756
02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:37.620
TALIESIN: Some that come in plastic bags

3757
02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:38.853
that are very iffy.

3758
02:57:38.853 --> 02:57:41.353
MATT: Yeah, like, "Satin?"

3759
02:57:44.303 --> 02:57:45.340
ASHLEY: They have an ad on them.

3760
02:57:45.340 --> 02:57:47.917
MATT: For the 12 of them, it'll cost you,

3761
02:57:47.917 --> 02:57:52.460
we'll say five gold pieces all together.

3762
02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:54.930
LAURA: Oh, awesome.
MATT: And for additional material.

3763
02:57:54.930 --> 02:57:57.020
They're not super fancy cloaks, but they're

3764
02:57:57.020 --> 02:58:00.840
decent enough to still cost, you know, a fair sum.

3765
02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:03.704
TALIESIN: Lord of the Rings cloak.
LAURA: Yeah, pretty much.

3766
02:58:03.704 --> 02:58:05.577
MATT: Yep, it's from Party City.

3767
02:58:06.551 --> 02:58:08.350
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3768
02:58:08.350 --> 02:58:10.390
MATT: Material, you could purchase enough material

3769
02:58:10.390 --> 02:58:13.790
for 20 cloaks if you'd like and that'll run you,

3770
02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:17.420
just material-wise, about an additional six gold.

3771
02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:19.420
ASHLEY: You could make them.

3772
02:58:19.420 --> 02:58:20.637
LAURA: Okay.

3773
02:58:20.637 --> 02:58:23.810
And all that fabric will fit in my haversack?

3774
02:58:23.810 --> 02:58:24.987
MATT: It will, but it would push

3775
02:58:24.987 --> 02:58:26.690
the limits of one of the pouches.

3776
02:58:29.195 --> 02:58:30.203
SAM: There's some stuff in there.

3777
02:58:30.203 --> 02:58:32.050
TRAVIS: You don't need 20 acolytes, you only need 12.

3778
02:58:33.780 --> 02:58:34.890
LAURA: Well.
MARISHA: It's very biblical.

3779
02:58:34.890 --> 02:58:36.950
TRAVIS: Of varying sizes.
MATT: In fact, for the haversack,

3780
02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:37.860
it might be a little tough because

3781
02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:40.850
the bolts are pretty, pretty long and the haversack

3782
02:58:40.850 --> 02:58:42.810
has limitations on the pocket size.

3783
02:58:42.810 --> 02:58:45.241
Might be something that you have to
consider with the bag of holding.

3784
02:58:45.241 --> 02:58:47.840
LAURA: Okay, I can just carry them.

3785
02:58:47.840 --> 02:58:49.630
Okay, well, I'm just going to get the additional

3786
02:58:49.630 --> 02:58:52.950
six gold worth of fabric, just in case.

3787
02:58:52.950 --> 02:58:55.140
MATT: So we'll say four bolts of green fabric

3788
02:58:55.140 --> 02:58:57.550
is what you can put down.

3789
02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:59.970
TALIESIN: I hate going to the fabric
district, it's too much.

3790
02:58:59.970 --> 02:59:01.900
LIAM: You love going to the fabric district.

3791
02:59:01.900 --> 02:59:05.235
TALIESIN: I like going to the clothing-- well, yeah.

3792
02:59:05.235 --> 02:59:07.541
TRAVIS: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Raw bolts, though.

3793
02:59:07.541 --> 02:59:09.020
ASHLEY: Raw bolts.
TALIESIN: Raw bolts, it's just like--

3794
02:59:09.020 --> 02:59:10.233
MATT: I like going to the fabric district.

3795
02:59:10.233 --> 02:59:13.378
SAM: Not enough gold?
LAURA: No, I do.

3796
02:59:13.378 --> 02:59:17.277
Wait, okay, but platinum is--

3797
02:59:17.277 --> 02:59:19.943
equals 10 gold.
MATT: Correct.

3798
02:59:19.943 --> 02:59:22.520
LAURA: I thought if I just subtracted the gold,

3799
02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:25.967
it would automatically make my platinum go down.

3800
02:59:25.967 --> 02:59:26.990
LIAM: Got to be careful, though.

3801
02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:28.450
SAM: You can get change, right?

3802
02:59:28.450 --> 02:59:29.780
LAURA: That's what I thought.

3803
02:59:29.780 --> 02:59:32.220
SAM: I mean, with the seller.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3804
02:59:32.220 --> 02:59:34.510
TRAVIS: What's the platinum to gold
exchange rate in Exandria?

3805
02:59:34.510 --> 02:59:38.607
MATT: 10 gold per platinum.
ASHLEY: Changes approved per day, fluctuates.

3806
02:59:38.607 --> 02:59:40.044
TRAVIS: 10.01.

3807
02:59:40.044 --> 02:59:41.320
MATT: You have to keep tabs on that.

3808
02:59:41.320 --> 02:59:43.540
LAURA: So, if I subtract one platinum, I can add 100 gold.

3809
02:59:43.540 --> 02:59:45.677
SAM: 10 gold.
MATT: 10 gold for one platinum.

3810
02:59:45.677 --> 02:59:46.888
LAURA: 10 gold, right.

3811
02:59:46.888 --> 02:59:49.591
Okay, so, okay, so that's--

3812
02:59:49.591 --> 02:59:51.978
MATT: One platinum and one gold will pay for both

3813
02:59:51.978 --> 02:59:54.970
the cloaks and the bolt.
LAURA: Okay.

3814
02:59:57.050 --> 02:59:58.300
SAM: Sugar.
LAURA: That is nine gold.

3815
02:59:58.300 --> 03:00:00.418
Okay, got it.

3816
03:00:01.820 --> 03:00:04.020
SAM: All right, hour's up, Cay.

3817
03:00:04.020 --> 03:00:05.550
We're leaving.
LIAM: Okay.

3818
03:00:05.550 --> 03:00:07.340
ASHLEY: Real quick.

3819
03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:10.700
I want to go up to my room just alone.

3820
03:00:10.700 --> 03:00:11.533
MATT: Okay.

3821
03:00:13.682 --> 03:00:15.770
ASHLEY: I'm going to close the door, make sure

3822
03:00:15.770 --> 03:00:18.380
that it's locked.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

3823
03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:24.760
ASHLEY: Am I able to take off the breastplate?

3824
03:00:25.012 --> 03:00:26.827
TRAVIS: Ooh.
MATT: Yeah, you are.

3825
03:00:28.004 --> 03:00:30.160
It takes a little bit to do it yourself,

3826
03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:31.960
probably five minutes to pull off.

3827
03:00:32.830 --> 03:00:33.663
ASHLEY: Okay.

3828
03:00:38.152 --> 03:00:40.319
(sighs)

3829
03:00:42.220 --> 03:00:44.420
I'm going to put it back on.

3830
03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:45.253
MATT: Okay.

3831
03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:50.353
ASHLEY: Then I go downstairs.
MATT: Okay.

3832
03:00:50.353 --> 03:00:51.953
LIAM: Did it say Crayola underneath?

3833
03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:53.633
MATT: No.
ASHLEY: No.

3834
03:00:55.616 --> 03:00:57.300
MATT: What do you guys want to do?

3835
03:00:57.300 --> 03:01:00.970
TRAVIS: We are preparing to go on a quest.

3836
03:01:00.970 --> 03:01:02.970
LAURA: Yeah.

3837
03:01:02.970 --> 03:01:04.800
MARISHA: Caduceus, where do we go?

3838
03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:05.700
TALIESIN: Where's the map?

3839
03:01:06.860 --> 03:01:09.080
MARISHA: There's no reason to check
back in at the Empire, right?

3840
03:01:09.080 --> 03:01:10.546
We're good for a bit.

3841
03:01:10.546 --> 03:01:12.021
SAM: Yeah, four weeks.

3842
03:01:12.021 --> 03:01:13.490
MARISHA: All right.
LIAM: Did you respond to them?

3843
03:01:13.490 --> 03:01:14.860
LAURA: Oh, I should respond.

3844
03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:16.510
I'm going to send a message back.

3845
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:19.190
Oh, but I could have responded to his messages.

3846
03:01:19.190 --> 03:01:23.990
So yes, I would've done that and said: Cool, good to know.

3847
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:25.190
Everything's good here.

3848
03:01:26.590 --> 03:01:30.370
We are doing what you said and we'll let them know

3849
03:01:30.370 --> 03:01:32.730
about the meet up and it's all good to go.

3850
03:01:32.730 --> 03:01:33.563
MATT: Okay.

3851
03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:36.535
Make an intelligence check, Caleb.

3852
03:01:36.535 --> 03:01:39.790
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
TALIESIN: Whitedawn Lagoon?

3853
03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:44.560
LIAM: I roll terrible in this campaign, 13 total.

3854
03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:45.810
Rolled a three.

3855
03:01:48.862 --> 03:01:51.750
SAM: Oh boy.
LIAM: Hmm.

3856
03:01:51.750 --> 03:01:52.890
TALIESIN: Oh, you might have the map.

3857
03:01:52.890 --> 03:01:55.464
Which map? I'm trying to find the right map.

3858
03:01:55.464 --> 03:01:57.630
MATT: The Whitedawn Lagoon is at
the very bottom of that map.

3859
03:01:57.630 --> 03:01:58.740
TALIESIN: Yeah, Whitedawn Lagoon.

3860
03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:02.295
MATT: It is a challenge to get to from where you are.

3861
03:02:02.295 --> 03:02:04.950
TALIESIN: But?
MATT: So you have to figure out,

3862
03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:06.060
if that's where you're heading next,

3863
03:02:06.060 --> 03:02:09.365
then consider your course of travel.

3864
03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:13.785
LAURA: Essek! (laughs)

3865
03:02:13.785 --> 03:02:17.360
SAM: This is in, in the Dynasty?

3866
03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:19.560
TRAVIS: Yeah, so it's south of where we are right now.

3867
03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:22.562
TALIESIN: So would it be best to leave from

3868
03:02:22.562 --> 03:02:26.330
the Menagerie Coast and take the boat, perhaps?

3869
03:02:26.330 --> 03:02:27.163
LAURA: I mean, maybe.

3870
03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:30.370
TRAVIS: Oh wow.
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

3871
03:02:30.370 --> 03:02:33.338
TRAVIS: Instead of going across land?

3872
03:02:33.338 --> 03:02:35.844
SAM: Does that connect?
LAURA: Yeah.

3873
03:02:35.844 --> 03:02:39.022
MATT: If you go from Nicodranas, you'd head south

3874
03:02:39.022 --> 03:02:41.840
past Rumblecusp, Urukayxl,

3875
03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:44.900
and then you continue to go west, and you'll

3876
03:02:44.900 --> 03:02:47.130
eventually get there.
LAURA: We could do a fly by of where the Con's going to be.

3877
03:02:47.130 --> 03:02:50.110
MATT: But it'll take a while via ship.
SAM: West?

3878
03:02:50.110 --> 03:02:52.480
MATT: Specifically--
MARISHA: Longer?

3879
03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:55.270
MATT: If you're going a fast pace, oh actually no,

3880
03:02:55.270 --> 03:02:59.240
it's just a regular pace on ship there,

3881
03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:02.630
about four miles an hour. Well, if you're a longship,

3882
03:03:02.630 --> 03:03:03.790
about three miles an hour, actually,

3883
03:03:03.790 --> 03:03:05.590
because you're not a galley, you're a longship.

3884
03:03:05.590 --> 03:03:07.670
So three miles an hour is what you're

3885
03:03:07.670 --> 03:03:11.720
looking to be traveling at and the distance around is--

3886
03:03:12.911 --> 03:03:15.631
I'll have to check what the--

3887
03:03:15.631 --> 03:03:18.840
It's going to be a few hundred miles.

3888
03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:19.673
MARISHA: How, huh?

3889
03:03:19.673 --> 03:03:20.977
What'd you say?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3890
03:03:20.977 --> 03:03:21.952
MATT: A few hundred miles.

3891
03:03:21.952 --> 03:03:24.083
TRAVIS: Maybe we should travel magically.

3892
03:03:24.083 --> 03:03:27.080
LAURA: But we still have to get our boat there.

3893
03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:29.040
SAM: Yeah, but we can do that in a--

3894
03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:32.090
LAURA: No, we have to tell Orly to get our boat to meet us

3895
03:03:32.090 --> 03:03:35.126
if we're going to and it'll still take him--

3896
03:03:35.126 --> 03:03:37.150
SAM: Well, we should send him now.

3897
03:03:37.150 --> 03:03:39.160
TALIESIN: We should at least let Orly know

3898
03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:40.460
where he needs to be when.

3899
03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:43.390
LAURA: So where should I tell him to meet us?

3900
03:03:43.390 --> 03:03:46.360
TALIESIN: Well, probably board at the Menagerie Coast

3901
03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:48.560
to head to where the meeting's going to be,

3902
03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:52.360
so however long with a little time extra.

3903
03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:53.660
TRAVIS: So tell him to meet us at the

3904
03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:55.070
Menagerie Coast in three weeks?

3905
03:03:55.070 --> 03:03:57.050
LAURA: And then we just bamf to Menagerie Coast?

3906
03:03:57.050 --> 03:03:59.950
TRAVIS: I mean, ideally, it'd be
Essek to where we need to go,

3907
03:03:59.950 --> 03:04:01.430
Caleb to the Menagerie Coast.

3908
03:04:03.990 --> 03:04:05.680
TALIESIN: Where are we right now?

3909
03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:07.470
SAM: Then the boat to wherever we need to go.

3910
03:04:07.470 --> 03:04:09.430
LAURA: But then, I mean, he said the boat is going to take,

3911
03:04:09.430 --> 03:04:13.820
to the meetup point, the boat will take a few hundred miles?

3912
03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:15.470
TRAVIS: To the Lucidian Ocean, which is

3913
03:04:16.420 --> 03:04:19.710
a hundred miles away?

3914
03:04:19.710 --> 03:04:21.640
MATT: The Menagerie Coast should have a--

3915
03:04:23.260 --> 03:04:26.130
MARISHA: It's really not going to be quicker

3916
03:04:26.130 --> 03:04:29.900
to go by boat than to walk?

3917
03:04:29.900 --> 03:04:33.500
TALIESIN: Or ride.
MARISHA: We got to get horses?

3918
03:04:33.500 --> 03:04:35.010
MATT: Can you go ahead and get my map out?

3919
03:04:35.010 --> 03:04:36.970
Going to double check.
LIAM: Horses would be better. Moorbounders.

3920
03:04:36.970 --> 03:04:38.240
SAM: No, but so where we're going right now

3921
03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:40.660
is not where the Traveler Con is.

3922
03:04:40.660 --> 03:04:44.380
LAURA: No, we're going to Caduceus' place first.

3923
03:04:44.380 --> 03:04:47.010
SAM: Yes, so we don't need the boat there at all.

3924
03:04:47.010 --> 03:04:49.530
LAURA: No, but we just need to
tell the boat where to meet us

3925
03:04:49.530 --> 03:04:50.960
because it's going to take a while

3926
03:04:50.960 --> 03:04:53.211
from wherever we go to get to the meet up,

3927
03:04:53.211 --> 03:04:54.690
right?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3928
03:04:54.690 --> 03:04:57.540
MARISHA: Unless we-- but we don't know

3929
03:04:57.540 --> 03:04:59.300
where the meet up point is yet, right?

3930
03:04:59.300 --> 03:05:00.640
That's part of the problem.

3931
03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:01.820
LAURA: But I thought we did, I thought he just

3932
03:05:01.820 --> 03:05:03.170
told me where the meet up point was.

3933
03:05:03.170 --> 03:05:07.840
MARISHA: Well, we're meeting in the Menagerie,

3934
03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:10.920
in Nicodranas and then setting port from Nicodranas,

3935
03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:11.910
is that's what happening?

3936
03:05:11.910 --> 03:05:14.900
LIAM: Matt, DM, oh, you're already calculating something.

3937
03:05:14.900 --> 03:05:16.230
TRAVIS: What is that?
MATT: What is your question?

3938
03:05:16.230 --> 03:05:18.370
LIAM: I can't remember, did we name a specific place

3939
03:05:18.370 --> 03:05:20.100
or just a region at this point?

3940
03:05:20.100 --> 03:05:25.100
MATT: You named a center point between Nicodranas

3941
03:05:25.720 --> 03:05:28.320
and the Whitedawn Lagoon.

3942
03:05:28.320 --> 03:05:29.545
LIAM: To be determined?

3943
03:05:29.545 --> 03:05:30.811
MATT: It is to be determined,

3944
03:05:30.811 --> 03:05:32.820
and they're going to notify you

3945
03:05:32.820 --> 03:05:34.930
as soon as they find out the specifics there.

3946
03:05:34.930 --> 03:05:37.870
There is no landfall, it is to be at sea on a ship.

3947
03:05:37.870 --> 03:05:39.428
LAURA: Okay.

3948
03:05:39.428 --> 03:05:40.720
MATT: It's going to be just south

3949
03:05:40.720 --> 03:05:42.360
of the southern-most portion of

3950
03:05:42.360 --> 03:05:46.210
the Ashkeeper Peaks is generally where it's going to be.

3951
03:05:46.210 --> 03:05:49.120
TALIESIN: This is also where--
MATT: Which is about, by ship,

3952
03:05:50.472 --> 03:05:54.030
it's about 300 miles ride from Nicodranas

3953
03:05:54.030 --> 03:05:57.510
via reg-standard ship, which is why it's taking four weeks

3954
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:59.920
to arrange this based on the location you guys chose.

3955
03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:01.300
All the naval forces of both sides

3956
03:06:01.300 --> 03:06:03.970
are going to be present here, are all preparing,

3957
03:06:03.970 --> 03:06:05.200
getting things ready, and then doing

3958
03:06:05.200 --> 03:06:07.960
an extended travel there, hence why it's taking

3959
03:06:07.960 --> 03:06:09.880
four weeks before this arrangement happens.

3960
03:06:09.880 --> 03:06:11.450
LAURA: Okay.

3961
03:06:13.980 --> 03:06:15.590
MATT: That is where it stands.

3962
03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:18.467
To the Whitedawn Lagoon from Nicodranas,

3963
03:06:18.467 --> 03:06:23.270
it's going to be roughly 450 miles travel.

3964
03:06:23.270 --> 03:06:24.728
TALIESIN: What's our closest point

3965
03:06:24.728 --> 03:06:29.378
of comfortable teleportation with what we have now

3966
03:06:29.378 --> 03:06:30.670
from the Whitedawn Lagoon?

3967
03:06:31.610 --> 03:06:35.400
MATT: You're looking at either Nicodranas or Asarius.

3968
03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:38.460
TALIESIN: Where is Asarius?
MARISHA: It's north of Nicodranas.

3969
03:06:38.460 --> 03:06:39.293
Right?

3970
03:06:39.293 --> 03:06:40.899
ASHLEY: Where's Nicodranas?

3971
03:06:40.899 --> 03:06:43.686
LIAM: I love that we all have this map.

3972
03:06:43.686 --> 03:06:45.870
TRAVIS: That's the Empire over there.

3973
03:06:45.870 --> 03:06:47.670
MATT: Yeah, the Empire map, it's not on there.

3974
03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:50.369
LAURA: But, yeah. (laughs)

3975
03:06:50.369 --> 03:06:52.594
TRAVIS: Is it on Xhorhas, Asarius?

3976
03:06:52.594 --> 03:06:54.210
MATT: Asarius is on the Xhorhas map, yes.

3977
03:06:54.210 --> 03:06:58.230
It is in the center north area.

3978
03:06:58.230 --> 03:07:00.020
LIAM: So we want to travel south and we want our boat

3979
03:07:00.020 --> 03:07:03.182
to start traveling now to pick us up just off the,

3980
03:07:03.182 --> 03:07:04.574
on the coast underneath where we're going

3981
03:07:04.574 --> 03:07:06.883
for Cad's shizznit.

3982
03:07:06.883 --> 03:07:09.940
LAURA: Because we need to be where for you, here?

3983
03:07:09.940 --> 03:07:11.440
No, for you.

3984
03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:13.140
Oh, it is the lagoon.
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's the

3985
03:07:13.140 --> 03:07:14.410
Whitedawn Lagoon is where we're going.

3986
03:07:14.410 --> 03:07:15.243
LAURA: Well, shit.

3987
03:07:15.243 --> 03:07:17.710
LIAM: Send Orly to the southern tip.

3988
03:07:17.710 --> 03:07:19.140
LAURA: Of the Whitedawn Lagoon.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

3989
03:07:19.140 --> 03:07:20.890
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to--

3990
03:07:20.890 --> 03:07:22.010
MATT: That's for your teleportation as well.

3991
03:07:22.010 --> 03:07:23.800
You guys have been to the Lotusden Greenwood,

3992
03:07:23.800 --> 03:07:25.570
that is where you battled--

3993
03:07:25.570 --> 03:07:27.120
LAURA: Oh yeah, we could bamf there.

3994
03:07:28.210 --> 03:07:30.140
SAM: We don't have a circle, we can go there?

3995
03:07:30.140 --> 03:07:31.870
LAURA: But Essek could take us.
MATT: You do not have the thing.

3996
03:07:31.870 --> 03:07:34.160
Essek took you there last time.

3997
03:07:34.160 --> 03:07:36.350
LIAM: What was that?
MATT: Essek took you guys there last time.

3998
03:07:36.350 --> 03:07:37.570
LIAM: Took us there last time.

3999
03:07:37.570 --> 03:07:39.584
LAURA: He likes us now, he could take us.

4000
03:07:39.584 --> 03:07:40.950
TALIESIN: There's a pass.

4001
03:07:41.880 --> 03:07:43.971
MARISHA: The Lagoon's where we chased

4002
03:07:43.971 --> 03:07:45.512
Yasha and Obann, right?

4003
03:07:45.512 --> 03:07:47.650
Yeah, okay, okay.

4004
03:07:47.650 --> 03:07:49.250
LAURA: Yeah, we chased you.

4005
03:07:49.250 --> 03:07:51.749
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's right.

4006
03:07:53.340 --> 03:07:55.689
TALIESIN: Asarius is right here.

4007
03:07:55.689 --> 03:07:57.497
LAURA: That's really far.

4008
03:07:57.497 --> 03:07:59.620
SAM: Yeah, let's get Essek and go by magic.

4009
03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:00.580
This is crazy.

4010
03:08:00.580 --> 03:08:01.980
LAURA: Let's go to his house, let's go to his house.

4011
03:08:01.980 --> 03:08:03.330
Show us where his house is.

4012
03:08:04.775 --> 03:08:06.610
LIAM: Okay, we can do that.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

4013
03:08:06.610 --> 03:08:08.376
LAURA: Are we ready to go? Let's go.

4014
03:08:08.376 --> 03:08:09.768
SAM: Yep, let's go. Bye!

4015
03:08:09.768 --> 03:08:11.840
MATT: So you're gathering all your
materials and getting ready to move?

4016
03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:13.156
LIAM: We're splitting.

4017
03:08:13.156 --> 03:08:14.422
Is that cool, everybody?
ALL: Yeah.

4018
03:08:14.422 --> 03:08:16.370
LIAM: Okay, Beauregard and Caleb will lead

4019
03:08:16.370 --> 03:08:18.190
the group over to Essek's towers.

4020
03:08:18.190 --> 03:08:20.458
MARISHA: Bamfing straight to the lagoon.

4021
03:08:20.458 --> 03:08:22.160
LAURA: If we can.
MARISHA: Okay.

4022
03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:24.070
MATT: You pack up your materials and make your way across

4023
03:08:24.070 --> 03:08:29.070
the neighborhood to the outside of Essek's property.

4024
03:08:29.110 --> 03:08:30.820
For most of you, aside from the two of you,

4025
03:08:30.820 --> 03:08:33.310
this is your first time seeing it

4026
03:08:33.310 --> 03:08:35.890
in its unique splendor, presented before you.

4027
03:08:36.940 --> 03:08:39.690
You come to the front gate, the gate is closed.

4028
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:43.190
MARISHA: Should we send him a message?

4029
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:44.580
LAURA: Yeah, I'll send him a message.

4030
03:08:46.095 --> 03:08:48.440
Hey Essek, we're out front of your house.

4031
03:08:49.820 --> 03:08:52.030
We're just wondering if you would have breakfast

4032
03:08:52.030 --> 03:08:54.580
with us in your house and also take us somewhere.

4033
03:08:56.370 --> 03:08:58.370
MARISHA: I start waving towards the house.

4034
03:08:59.380 --> 03:09:01.010
TRAVIS: That doesn't go through in the message.

4035
03:09:01.010 --> 03:09:02.850
MARISHA: He might, what if he peeks out?

4036
03:09:02.850 --> 03:09:06.110
MATT: He comes back, "I was wondering whether or not

4037
03:09:06.110 --> 03:09:07.810
"you were going to stop by today."

4038
03:09:09.810 --> 03:09:11.060
There's a brief pause and you see,

4039
03:09:11.060 --> 03:09:12.670
on one of the walkways from one of the towers,

4040
03:09:12.670 --> 03:09:14.840
you see a figure step out and look over.

4041
03:09:14.840 --> 03:09:17.240
MARISHA: Ha, see, see? Hey!

4042
03:09:17.240 --> 03:09:20.000
MATT: Gives a nod and continues to the next tower

4043
03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.300
and then eventually emerges from below.

4044
03:09:22.300 --> 03:09:24.104
Essek approaches, waves a hand, and the gate

4045
03:09:24.104 --> 03:09:26.080
(creaks) opens and lets you guys in.

4046
03:09:26.080 --> 03:09:27.310
LAURA: Yay.

4047
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:31.810
MATT: "Come, come, allow me to--"
LIAM: Sorry we are late.

4048
03:09:31.810 --> 03:09:32.758
MATT: "Oh, it is all right.

4049
03:09:32.758 --> 03:09:35.540
"I do have some food prepared as a

4050
03:09:35.540 --> 03:09:38.090
"return favor for the delicious dinner.

4051
03:09:38.090 --> 03:09:39.090
"Thank you, Caduceus.

4052
03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:42.340
"This way, please."
LAURA: Yay.

4053
03:09:42.340 --> 03:09:46.883
MATT: Leads you into this, what appears to be

4054
03:09:46.883 --> 03:09:49.700
a foyer-ish type chamber with nice

4055
03:09:49.700 --> 03:09:51.948
furniture curved on the edges of it.

4056
03:09:51.948 --> 03:09:55.090
The smell, when you come inside, is very

4057
03:09:56.942 --> 03:09:59.390
strangely herbal, like it has a very

4058
03:09:59.390 --> 03:10:02.780
earthy, herbal smell to the air there with a bit of--

4059
03:10:04.830 --> 03:10:08.680
only thing to describe it is like a hint of electrical fire,

4060
03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:10.380
something like that sort of smell.

4061
03:10:12.321 --> 03:10:14.900
There are these beautiful almost glass-like stairs

4062
03:10:14.900 --> 03:10:17.900
that emerge from the wall that don't have

4063
03:10:17.900 --> 03:10:21.290
a hard-set connecting pivot, they're just

4064
03:10:21.290 --> 03:10:24.180
free-floating, it seems, outside of the stone wall

4065
03:10:24.180 --> 03:10:25.760
and they're just translucent steps

4066
03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:28.310
that lead up the spiral of the tower you're in.

4067
03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:31.390
LAURA: Ultra modernist, got to say.

4068
03:10:31.390 --> 03:10:33.113
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

4069
03:10:33.113 --> 03:10:36.930
MATT: And he, "Allow me to take care of this for you,"

4070
03:10:36.930 --> 03:10:38.660
and he waves his hand for a second

4071
03:10:38.660 --> 03:10:40.945
and you watch as the chairs, the furniture

4072
03:10:40.945 --> 03:10:41.778
(scraping)

4073
03:10:41.778 --> 03:10:43.140
scoots from the edges into the center,

4074
03:10:43.140 --> 03:10:46.122
forming a little seating area, table scoots in.

4075
03:10:46.122 --> 03:10:47.630
LAURA: Caleb, you should learn to do that.

4076
03:10:47.630 --> 03:10:48.880
That's really impressive.

4077
03:10:50.670 --> 03:10:52.440
LIAM: I can do an approximation of it,

4078
03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:54.680
but it's a little more herky-jerky than that.

4079
03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:56.350
SAM: Big cat paw pushes it over.

4080
03:10:56.350 --> 03:10:57.800
LAURA: Oh, that's true, yeah.

4081
03:10:57.800 --> 03:10:59.250
MATT: Eventually, he brings some food

4082
03:10:59.250 --> 03:11:00.350
and sits you all down.

4083
03:11:02.500 --> 03:11:03.333
"So...

4084
03:11:05.604 --> 03:11:07.260
"how do I do this?

4085
03:11:07.260 --> 03:11:09.384
"How was your day?"

4086
03:11:09.384 --> 03:11:10.825
SAM: Really great so far.

4087
03:11:10.825 --> 03:11:14.543
We did some shopping, some errands, we're going on a trip.

4088
03:11:16.020 --> 03:11:18.990
LIAM: We've received word

4089
03:11:18.990 --> 03:11:21.680
of some of the details of this meeting.

4090
03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:23.796
LAURA: Yeah, they found Vence.

4091
03:11:23.796 --> 03:11:26.270
MATT: "Ah, that is good news.

4092
03:11:26.270 --> 03:11:28.080
"It appears now both sides have a

4093
03:11:29.575 --> 03:11:32.300
"cultist of some esteem in our midst.

4094
03:11:32.300 --> 03:11:34.870
"That bodes well for the negotiations."

4095
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:36.250
LAURA: Should I just tell you?

4096
03:11:36.250 --> 03:11:38.090
They said the negotiation's good to go.

4097
03:11:38.090 --> 03:11:39.340
Everyone's getting ready.

4098
03:11:40.900 --> 03:11:43.127
SAM: Four weeks.
LAURA: Four weeks.

4099
03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:46.830
MATT: "They've probably notified at
least someone in the council,

4100
03:11:46.830 --> 03:11:50.080
"but I will pass this on as well.

4101
03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:53.790
"Four weeks, very well.

4102
03:11:53.790 --> 03:11:55.865
"Did you bring that project you were working on?"

4103
03:11:55.865 --> 03:11:58.360
LIAM: I have it with me all the time, yeah.

4104
03:11:58.360 --> 03:12:00.020
Do you want to eat first and then--

4105
03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:01.400
MATT: "Yes, yes, let's eat.

4106
03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:04.820
"Or you could eat and we can take a look at it."

4107
03:12:04.820 --> 03:12:06.903
ASHLEY: How was your day?

4108
03:12:07.750 --> 03:12:10.330
MATT: "Fine, I've been here."
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4109
03:12:10.330 --> 03:12:11.870
LAURA: Do you go out during the day?

4110
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:13.336
Do you go shopping and stuff?

4111
03:12:14.294 --> 03:12:16.184
MATT: "When necessary."

4112
03:12:16.184 --> 03:12:17.375
MARISHA: Do you float in your house

4113
03:12:17.375 --> 03:12:19.300
or do you walk in your house?

4114
03:12:19.300 --> 03:12:20.722
Does he float in his house?

4115
03:12:20.722 --> 03:12:21.821
MATT: He's currently floating and as soon

4116
03:12:21.821 --> 03:12:24.870
as you say that, he goes (footsteps impact).

4117
03:12:24.870 --> 03:12:27.080
MARISHA: You don't have to float around us, man.

4118
03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:27.913
It's cool.

4119
03:12:27.913 --> 03:12:29.163
MATT: "It's a habit."

4120
03:12:30.390 --> 03:12:33.290
TRAVIS: You should walk with, what is it, a swagger.

4121
03:12:33.290 --> 03:12:35.760
You could show, you could show him how to walk with swagger.

4122
03:12:35.760 --> 03:12:36.910
MARISHA: I could totally teach you swagger.

4123
03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:39.530
TRAVIS: Like your ring walk, you know, like how you prep.

4124
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:41.080
MARISHA: Want me to teach you swagger?

4125
03:12:43.390 --> 03:12:44.570
MATT: "I don't know what that is."

4126
03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:45.899
TRAVIS: Sure, sure.
MARISHA: You know, sass?

4127
03:12:45.899 --> 03:12:47.407
TRAVIS: Fucking crack it out, let's go.

4128
03:12:47.407 --> 03:12:49.935
MARISHA: You know?
TRAVIS: What-- are you miming?

4129
03:12:49.935 --> 03:12:51.920
LAURA: What is this, what is--

4130
03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:53.540
MARISHA: I walk with swagger.

4131
03:12:54.862 --> 03:12:55.978
SAM: Oh, oh.

4132
03:12:56.854 --> 03:12:57.950
(laughter)

4133
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:59.520
LIAM: Strut.
TRAVIS: Yeah, do what she does.

4134
03:12:59.520 --> 03:13:01.600
It's, you know.
SAM: Vogue.

4135
03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:03.280
MATT: "I'm good, thank you."
MARISHA: Aw, come on.

4136
03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:04.880
TRAVIS: I follow Beau around the room.

4137
03:13:06.300 --> 03:13:07.133
LAURA: Wow.
MATT: "Very well.

4138
03:13:07.133 --> 03:13:09.130
"Can I have look at your notes?"

4139
03:13:09.130 --> 03:13:11.520
MARISHA: You know this trick, right?

4140
03:13:11.520 --> 03:13:12.471
You know this one?

4141
03:13:12.471 --> 03:13:14.409
TRAVIS: You push up.
MARISHA: Essek, Essek!

4142
03:13:14.409 --> 03:13:15.650
MATT: His cloak is completely

4143
03:13:15.650 --> 03:13:18.400
obscuring his torso and he's--

4144
03:13:18.400 --> 03:13:19.641
MARISHA: Essek, yeah?

4145
03:13:19.641 --> 03:13:21.930
LIAM: You are making him uncomfortable.

4146
03:13:21.930 --> 03:13:23.100
You're making him uncomfortable.

4147
03:13:23.100 --> 03:13:25.774
TRAVIS: Ka-pow, Stormlord, thunder and lightning.

4148
03:13:25.774 --> 03:13:28.365
MARISHA: (whispering) Swagger.

4149
03:13:28.365 --> 03:13:30.540
MATT: "There are cheeses."

4150
03:13:30.540 --> 03:13:32.493
LAURA: Ooh, I like cheese.
TALIESIN: I am so excited for cheese.

4151
03:13:32.493 --> 03:13:35.201
This is good.

4152
03:13:35.201 --> 03:13:36.342
LAURA: What kind of pastries?

4153
03:13:36.342 --> 03:13:38.520
Are we talking good pastries?

4154
03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:41.040
MATT: They're some small

4155
03:13:41.040 --> 03:13:42.800
wafer cookies, nothing too super sweet.

4156
03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:44.970
You're a little disappointed.

4157
03:13:44.970 --> 03:13:46.395
They're okay.

4158
03:13:46.395 --> 03:13:48.002
Dry up the mouth a little bit.

4159
03:13:48.002 --> 03:13:49.756
(laughter)

4160
03:13:49.756 --> 03:13:52.700
SAM: I'm going to put a couple in my pocket.
MARISHA: That's pretty good disappointment.

4161
03:13:52.700 --> 03:13:54.572
MATT: They're functional.

4162
03:13:54.572 --> 03:13:55.405
SAM: Show him!

4163
03:13:55.405 --> 03:13:56.513
MATT: Grandma gives you vanilla wafers

4164
03:13:56.513 --> 03:13:57.500
and you're like, "Mm."

4165
03:13:57.500 --> 03:13:59.440
LIAM: Right here or--
SAM: Yeah, show him the book.

4166
03:13:59.440 --> 03:14:02.480
LIAM: All right, so Caleb starts to move food and drink

4167
03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:03.390
out of the way because he doesn't want to

4168
03:14:03.390 --> 03:14:04.564
harm any of the books.

4169
03:14:04.564 --> 03:14:07.440
MATT: "Here, come to my laboratory.

4170
03:14:07.440 --> 03:14:08.850
"It would be easier."
LIAM: Oh.

4171
03:14:08.850 --> 03:14:10.560
LAURA: Should we all go?
SAM: No, no.

4172
03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:12.670
LAURA: Just them?
SAM: Just me and Caleb.

4173
03:14:12.670 --> 03:14:15.800
TRAVIS: Feed your ferret your crackers or whatever.

4174
03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:16.970
LIAM: All right, for a second.

4175
03:14:16.970 --> 03:14:19.850
Nott, come.
SAM: Of course.

4176
03:14:19.850 --> 03:14:23.570
MATT: He leads you up the stairs, gliding

4177
03:14:23.570 --> 03:14:25.770
for the first few steps and then

4178
03:14:25.770 --> 03:14:28.110
stops and starts actually taking steps.

4179
03:14:28.110 --> 03:14:31.130
There's a bit of

4180
03:14:31.130 --> 03:14:33.650
a disjointed aspect to it. You see him trying to

4181
03:14:33.650 --> 03:14:36.650
change his instinctual behavior around you.

4182
03:14:36.650 --> 03:14:38.600
LAURA: I bet Essek gets really tired when he's

4183
03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:41.100
walking up stairs now because he's not used to doing it,

4184
03:14:41.100 --> 03:14:43.239
so when he's forced to do it, it's like.

4185
03:14:43.239 --> 03:14:44.636
MATT: (laughs)

4186
03:14:44.636 --> 03:14:46.061
LAURA: He doesn't want to act winded but he's

4187
03:14:46.061 --> 03:14:49.290
probably really out of breath by the time he's at the top.

4188
03:14:49.290 --> 03:14:51.580
MATT: You head up to a secondary floor.

4189
03:14:51.580 --> 03:14:53.730
This one has a window that overlooks

4190
03:14:53.730 --> 03:14:55.370
that part of the neighborhood.

4191
03:14:55.370 --> 03:14:57.310
There are a number of shelves of books,

4192
03:14:57.310 --> 03:15:00.940
there are some small glass cases that contain

4193
03:15:00.940 --> 03:15:03.070
what looks to be keepsakes or objects

4194
03:15:03.070 --> 03:15:04.330
that are just out of view.

4195
03:15:04.330 --> 03:15:06.770
He leads you to one of two doors

4196
03:15:06.770 --> 03:15:08.600
that opens up into one of those pathways

4197
03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:10.630
that connects towers and leads you to

4198
03:15:10.630 --> 03:15:13.710
the tallest tower and from there, you go into

4199
03:15:13.710 --> 03:15:16.880
a mid-chamber of this next structure.

4200
03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:20.590
Within here, the smell is almost saccharine-sweet,

4201
03:15:20.590 --> 03:15:21.910
but has a very chemical smell to it.

4202
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:23.830
You recognize it, as an alchemist.

4203
03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:26.720
There are a lot of elements here that remind you

4204
03:15:26.720 --> 03:15:30.710
of very sweet but caustic chemicals

4205
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:33.300
that are used in the creation of potions,

4206
03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:35.640
that are used in the creation of compounds

4207
03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:38.350
that can break down metals and other such things.

4208
03:15:38.350 --> 03:15:40.610
It's a mixture of some alchemy

4209
03:15:40.610 --> 03:15:42.660
or elements close to it are done in here.

4210
03:15:44.155 --> 03:15:46.100
But then he leads you up another set of stairs

4211
03:15:46.100 --> 03:15:49.670
to a tall chamber beneath where you imagine

4212
03:15:49.670 --> 03:15:52.180
that strange moving spherical

4213
03:15:52.180 --> 03:15:54.010
series of rings were on the top.

4214
03:15:54.010 --> 03:15:55.510
As you head into this final room,

4215
03:15:55.510 --> 03:15:59.370
the entire chamber itself has these deep grooves

4216
03:15:59.370 --> 03:16:02.370
dug into stone across and edge to edge.

4217
03:16:02.370 --> 03:16:04.240
And you immediately recognize it.

4218
03:16:04.240 --> 03:16:06.660
It is hundreds and hundreds of lines.

4219
03:16:06.660 --> 03:16:10.150
It looks like someone has dug every possible

4220
03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:12.290
line path connecting element here

4221
03:16:12.290 --> 03:16:16.290
and for certain magicians or sorcerers,

4222
03:16:16.290 --> 03:16:18.880
practitioners of magic, this is essentially

4223
03:16:18.880 --> 03:16:22.597
a bunch of pre-set grooves that most basic

4224
03:16:22.597 --> 03:16:27.597
and advanced runic circles can be drawn within here

4225
03:16:27.840 --> 03:16:30.923
with whatever materials very quickly.

4226
03:16:32.671 --> 03:16:37.570
LIAM: (exhales) This is beautiful.

4227
03:16:37.570 --> 03:16:39.490
MATT: All the candles immediately light

4228
03:16:39.490 --> 03:16:41.135
as you all step inside.

4229
03:16:41.135 --> 03:16:42.926
LAURA: Are we all there or is just--

4230
03:16:42.926 --> 03:16:44.960
MATT: Just the two of them.
LAURA: Oh.

4231
03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:46.580
LIAM: I can't help it, I will always

4232
03:16:46.580 --> 03:16:49.800
love the architecture of a tower.

4233
03:16:51.564 --> 03:16:52.739
MATT: "We stick with them for a reason,

4234
03:16:52.739 --> 03:16:55.590
"it seems, as hackneyed as it may be.

4235
03:16:55.590 --> 03:16:57.170
"Come, come, set it down."

4236
03:16:57.170 --> 03:16:58.930
And he like--
LIAM: Closer to the heavens.

4237
03:16:58.930 --> 03:17:00.330
I start laying stuff out.

4238
03:17:00.330 --> 03:17:04.770
So this is what we acquired.

4239
03:17:04.770 --> 03:17:08.440
This is very old, these are unfinished, but

4240
03:17:08.440 --> 03:17:12.360
but much to be gleaned and I've done my best with them.

4241
03:17:12.360 --> 03:17:14.120
I lay out of Halas' stuff.
MATT: Mmkay.

4242
03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:15.640
LIAM: And then here is--
MATT: He takes his mantle off

4243
03:17:15.640 --> 03:17:17.600
and sets it aside and comes over to join you

4244
03:17:17.600 --> 03:17:18.970
as you guys start laying it out.

4245
03:17:18.970 --> 03:17:21.930
He's listening to you with one ear

4246
03:17:21.930 --> 03:17:23.960
and the rest of his mind is

4247
03:17:23.960 --> 03:17:26.460
in the process of taking in the extent of

4248
03:17:26.460 --> 03:17:28.790
what you've already drawn and connected.

4249
03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:31.180
LIAM: And Caleb recognizes that and says:

4250
03:17:31.180 --> 03:17:33.090
Okay, so while you're taking that in,

4251
03:17:33.090 --> 03:17:34.220
Nott, help me roll this out.

4252
03:17:34.220 --> 03:17:36.100
And here is what Nott and I have been working on.

4253
03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:38.680
This is my approximation, I've tried to

4254
03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:41.320
fill in some of the blanks and this

4255
03:17:41.320 --> 03:17:44.250
particular knot was hard to unravel, but we did.

4256
03:17:44.250 --> 03:17:47.450
And I know that I'm close,

4257
03:17:47.450 --> 03:17:50.010
but I am sure I am missing something.

4258
03:17:50.010 --> 03:17:52.636
SAM: Yeah, but he's got that look in his eye, he's close.

4259
03:17:52.636 --> 03:17:54.410
MATT: "I can see that look.

4260
03:17:55.251 --> 03:17:57.750
"(sighs) All right, I have some ideas,"

4261
03:17:57.750 --> 03:18:00.250
and he walks over to his shelf and starts

4262
03:18:00.250 --> 03:18:03.180
thumbing through different compounds

4263
03:18:03.180 --> 03:18:05.460
and pulling out elements and taking out

4264
03:18:05.460 --> 03:18:06.970
some additional books under his arm

4265
03:18:06.970 --> 03:18:10.320
and basically gets down on the floor with the two of you

4266
03:18:10.320 --> 03:18:12.750
and begins attempting to continue this.

4267
03:18:12.750 --> 03:18:14.590
You guys are having your cheeses and your snacks.

4268
03:18:14.590 --> 03:18:16.330
LAURA: We're practicing our swaggers.

4269
03:18:16.330 --> 03:18:18.770
MATT: About 40 minutes rolls by they've been gone

4270
03:18:18.770 --> 03:18:20.130
and you guys have just been sitting there

4271
03:18:20.130 --> 03:18:22.840
and waiting and talking and they have just not returned.

4272
03:18:22.840 --> 03:18:24.740
TRAVIS: Looking around his place.

4273
03:18:24.740 --> 03:18:26.898
There's a red button to push somewhere.

4274
03:18:26.898 --> 03:18:28.570
MARISHA: I don't want to touch anything,

4275
03:18:28.570 --> 03:18:31.420
but doing the like looky-looks.

4276
03:18:31.420 --> 03:18:33.750
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself.
MATT: Okay.

4277
03:18:34.584 --> 03:18:36.642
MARISHA: I just don't want to, like-- he'll know, right?

4278
03:18:36.642 --> 03:18:39.790
TRAVIS: Boop.
MARISHA: Ugh.

4279
03:18:39.790 --> 03:18:42.150
What'd we find?
MATT: Well, roll an investigation--

4280
03:18:42.150 --> 03:18:44.440
or no, it'd be perception check
if you're just looking around.

4281
03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:45.810
SAM: Are you, like, looking in his bookshelf

4282
03:18:45.810 --> 03:18:46.920
or are you going to the bathroom and, like,

4283
03:18:46.920 --> 03:18:48.120
looking in the medicine cabinet

4284
03:18:48.120 --> 03:18:49.930
to see what weird medicine he takes?

4285
03:18:49.930 --> 03:18:51.480
MARISHA: The medicine cabinet type of stuff.

4286
03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:52.710
LIAM: Ooh, what's this cream? (laughs)

4287
03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:53.860
MARISHA: Is that a difference, between

4288
03:18:53.860 --> 03:18:56.568
medicine cabinet versus just looking?

4289
03:18:57.650 --> 03:18:59.630
MATT: Well, but what do you mean?

4290
03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:03.240
TRAVIS: You find his bedroom and locate his bathroom.

4291
03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:04.740
&lt;ARISHA: Yeah, there's a difference between

4292
03:19:04.740 --> 03:19:06.410
being like, "What room is this?

4293
03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:09.140
Oh, master bath," and being like, "I'm going to go pee,"

4294
03:19:09.140 --> 03:19:11.350
and being like, "Ooh," behind the medicine cabinet.

4295
03:19:11.350 --> 03:19:13.370
TRAVIS and LAURA: That's some shady shit.

4296
03:19:13.370 --> 03:19:15.845
SAM: I do that to every house I go to.

4297
03:19:15.845 --> 03:19:16.678
ASHLEY: You, we know that.

4298
03:19:16.678 --> 03:19:18.416
SAM: If you invite me over,
I'm going to look at all your shit.

4299
03:19:18.416 --> 03:19:20.460
(laughter)

4300
03:19:20.460 --> 03:19:22.050
&lt;ATT So disappointed by the medicated shampoo--

4301
03:19:22.050 --> 03:19:23.750
ASHLEY: That's why I always put
a note in the medicine cabinet

4302
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:25.780
whenever you come over that says, "Hi Sam."

4303
03:19:25.780 --> 03:19:28.040
MATT: Okay, all right.

4304
03:19:29.935 --> 03:19:31.970
You head upstairs, or in the chamber you're in right here,

4305
03:19:31.970 --> 03:19:34.140
you can see plainly most of it's just furniture,

4306
03:19:34.140 --> 03:19:38.690
it's a hosting chamber, it seems,
though a lot of it's dusty.

4307
03:19:38.690 --> 03:19:42.190
It's generally just furniture and decor.

4308
03:19:42.190 --> 03:19:43.840
Do you go in the staircase above?

4309
03:19:45.170 --> 03:19:47.660
MARISHA: Just, which way are you going?

4310
03:19:47.660 --> 03:19:50.340
TRAVIS: Look for yourself, what are you doing?

4311
03:19:50.340 --> 03:19:53.750
MARISHA: Well, I just figured we could divide and conquer.

4312
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:56.650
I'll go upstairs.
MATT: Okay.

4313
03:19:56.650 --> 03:19:59.248
You head up into (laughs).

4314
03:19:59.248 --> 03:20:00.435
SAM: (roaring)

4315
03:20:00.435 --> 03:20:02.635
TALIESIN: Oh, that's the end of Beau right there.

4316
03:20:02.635 --> 03:20:04.430
MATT: This is the next chamber, this is where you see

4317
03:20:04.430 --> 03:20:06.810
there are bookshelves aligned in this area,

4318
03:20:06.810 --> 03:20:08.540
there are the two doorways, they're closed,

4319
03:20:08.540 --> 03:20:10.500
that lead out of the tower to those

4320
03:20:10.500 --> 03:20:12.730
walkways you thought you had seen.

4321
03:20:12.730 --> 03:20:15.940
There are a couple of small glass cases

4322
03:20:15.940 --> 03:20:17.200
that are off to the side.

4323
03:20:17.200 --> 03:20:19.180
MARISHA: What's with those glass cases?

4324
03:20:19.180 --> 03:20:20.970
MATT: You go ahead and look within.

4325
03:20:20.970 --> 03:20:22.970
One of them contains, it a rod,

4326
03:20:22.970 --> 03:20:25.153
maybe about a foot and a half long.

4327
03:20:26.530 --> 03:20:29.850
The other one, glancing inside, you can see

4328
03:20:29.850 --> 03:20:32.017
there's two books that are locked

4329
03:20:34.366 --> 03:20:36.730
with a actual physical lock holding them closed.

4330
03:20:36.730 --> 03:20:39.650
MARISHA: Can I see, like, do they have a name, title?

4331
03:20:39.650 --> 03:20:40.870
MATT: Do you know Undercommon?

4332
03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:44.525
MARISHA: Yes, I do now.
MATT: You do.

4333
03:20:44.525 --> 03:20:45.970
TALIESIN: What?

4334
03:20:45.970 --> 03:20:48.703
Glancing at one of them--
MARISHA: Expositors.

4335
03:20:48.703 --> 03:20:50.970
MATT: -- it goes into,

4336
03:20:50.970 --> 03:20:54.440
the title at least, and only one of them has a title,

4337
03:20:54.440 --> 03:20:58.320
the other one is, like, just a plain leather binding,

4338
03:20:58.320 --> 03:21:00.870
like a deep, deep leather, but there's no actual top.

4339
03:21:00.870 --> 03:21:03.450
The first one you look over and it says

4340
03:21:03.450 --> 03:21:06.450
in Undercommon the equivalent of

4341
03:21:07.610 --> 03:21:10.670
The Connecting Nether Between the Elements.

4342
03:21:11.670 --> 03:21:13.030
You're not quite sure what that refers to

4343
03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:15.970
or what the contents might be toying with,

4344
03:21:15.970 --> 03:21:18.120
but it seems to be something referring to

4345
03:21:19.530 --> 03:21:22.293
the elements.
MARISHA: Okay.

4346
03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:27.800
Dark matter shit, all right, cool.

4347
03:21:27.800 --> 03:21:29.260
Anything else I can check out?

4348
03:21:29.260 --> 03:21:31.050
Do I have time?
TRAVIS: There are double doors.

4349
03:21:31.050 --> 03:21:34.240
MATT: There's the two doors.
MARISHA: And then what else?

4350
03:21:34.240 --> 03:21:36.940
Bookshelves?
MATT: Bookshelves.

4351
03:21:36.940 --> 03:21:40.530
MARISHA: I just peek out the two doors,

4352
03:21:40.530 --> 03:21:42.270
do like a crack and a crack?

4353
03:21:42.270 --> 03:21:43.461
MATT: Neither of the doors open.

4354
03:21:43.461 --> 03:21:45.880
They are closed and they are locked.

4355
03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:47.730
MARISHA: (pen clicking)

4356
03:21:47.730 --> 03:21:50.640
Right, back to the bookshelves, do a quick scan.

4357
03:21:50.640 --> 03:21:52.360
MATT: Okay, it's all manner of collection,

4358
03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:53.970
all in Undercommon for the most part,

4359
03:21:53.970 --> 03:21:55.720
a couple of spattering of Common books.

4360
03:21:55.720 --> 03:21:58.560
Some of them are history, some of them deal with

4361
03:21:58.560 --> 03:22:01.090
studies of alchemical compounds,

4362
03:22:01.090 --> 03:22:05.420
some of them deal with historical recollections

4363
03:22:05.420 --> 03:22:07.970
of the Age of Arcanum and what elements

4364
03:22:07.970 --> 03:22:09.870
have been collected from what ruins have been found

4365
03:22:09.870 --> 03:22:11.830
and it uncovered. Writings of

4366
03:22:13.890 --> 03:22:16.540
prominent figures during that time period.

4367
03:22:16.540 --> 03:22:21.390
You see one that deals with the various societies

4368
03:22:22.664 --> 03:22:26.440
and races of Xhorhas and the social dynamics

4369
03:22:26.440 --> 03:22:29.850
pre- and post-Dynasty involvement.

4370
03:22:29.850 --> 03:22:31.070
These are just the things you,

4371
03:22:31.070 --> 03:22:34.670
it's a wide variety of books.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

4372
03:22:34.670 --> 03:22:36.210
I just head back downstairs

4373
03:22:36.210 --> 03:22:38.420
and I relay what I found to Fjord.

4374
03:22:39.350 --> 03:22:42.040
Glass cases, books.
TRAVIS: Man.

4375
03:22:42.040 --> 03:22:44.140
That's so tempting, but I mean, we just established

4376
03:22:44.140 --> 03:22:44.973
a friendship.
MARISHA: We really,

4377
03:22:44.973 --> 03:22:46.100
I don't want to, I don't want to be a dick.

4378
03:22:46.100 --> 03:22:46.960
TRAVIS: All right, fair, yeah.
MARISHA: I'm just

4379
03:22:46.960 --> 03:22:49.410
trying, I'm just being nosy.

4380
03:22:49.410 --> 03:22:51.620
What'd you find?
TRAVIS: Nothing.

4381
03:22:51.620 --> 03:22:52.880
He has no guests, ever.

4382
03:22:52.880 --> 03:22:54.430
There's, like, nothing in here.

4383
03:22:55.357 --> 03:22:58.122
It's just kind of bland.
TALIESIN: I like it.

4384
03:22:58.122 --> 03:22:59.872
LAURA: I think it's really nice in here.

4385
03:23:02.110 --> 03:23:05.120
TALIESIN: Simple.
LAURA: It's got nice staircases.

4386
03:23:05.120 --> 03:23:06.570
TALIESIN: It's a very nice staircase.

4387
03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:10.290
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out my harp and play a little.

4388
03:23:10.290 --> 03:23:12.410
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: To pass the time.

4389
03:23:12.410 --> 03:23:14.730
LAURA: I'm going to dance while she's playing the harp.

4390
03:23:14.730 --> 03:23:15.770
MATT: Okay, the acoustics--
TALIESIN: I'm going to take out

4391
03:23:15.770 --> 03:23:18.114
my flute--
LAURA: Swaggerly dances.

4392
03:23:18.114 --> 03:23:19.047
MARISHA: There's got to be something about this guy.

4393
03:23:19.047 --> 03:23:20.509
MATT: So, she swagger dances and then starts

4394
03:23:20.509 --> 03:23:23.950
playing the harp with a beautiful sound fills the chamber

4395
03:23:23.950 --> 03:23:28.040
and then the bone flute starts playing.

4396
03:23:28.040 --> 03:23:29.890
TALIESIN: Oh no, I'm not going to
actually, I'm just--

4397
03:23:29.890 --> 03:23:30.723
MATT: Okay.

4398
03:23:30.723 --> 03:23:33.288
(laughter)

4399
03:23:33.288 --> 03:23:34.480
I know.

4400
03:23:35.378 --> 03:23:39.161
In the interim, make an
arcana check with an advantage.

4401
03:23:39.161 --> 03:23:42.950
LIAM: Is it all right if I--
oh, with advantage, great.

4402
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:45.460
No need, no need.
TRAVIS: (deep scary voice) Come on.

4403
03:23:45.460 --> 03:23:48.920
LIAM: Come on.
TRAVIS: (deep scary voice) Roll that shit.

4404
03:23:48.920 --> 03:23:49.850
LIAM: Okay, cool, cool.

4405
03:23:49.850 --> 03:23:51.770
Cool, cool, cool.

4406
03:23:51.770 --> 03:23:53.160
Intelligence or arcana, did you say?

4407
03:23:53.160 --> 03:23:54.350
MATT: Arcana.
LIAM: 28.

4408
03:23:54.350 --> 03:23:56.291
SAM: Yes.
LAURA and TALIESIN: Whoa!

4409
03:23:56.291 --> 03:23:57.250
(whooping)

4410
03:23:57.250 --> 03:23:58.330
SAM: Showing off in front of Essek.

4411
03:23:58.330 --> 03:24:00.703
TALIESIN: Big wizard energy.
MATT: (sighing)

4412
03:24:00.703 --> 03:24:03.260
The three of you begin to sync and, like,

4413
03:24:03.260 --> 03:24:05.650
one person'll posit a question where they're

4414
03:24:05.650 --> 03:24:07.550
at a point in the equation
and the next finishes it,

4415
03:24:07.550 --> 03:24:10.240
they make eye contact and smile, grab something,

4416
03:24:10.240 --> 03:24:12.860
finish that line, grab this
piece of paper, toss it to you,

4417
03:24:12.860 --> 03:24:15.440
this equation finishes, and rapidly you become,

4418
03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:17.990
the three of you become fervored researchers,

4419
03:24:17.990 --> 03:24:19.990
on the cusp of a breakthrough.

4420
03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:23.340
By the close of the hour, the moment hits

4421
03:24:23.340 --> 03:24:25.212
where the equation connects

4422
03:24:25.212 --> 03:24:26.045
(gasping)

4423
03:24:26.045 --> 03:24:29.053
and the spell is complete.

4424
03:24:29.053 --> 03:24:29.895
(gasping)

4425
03:24:29.895 --> 03:24:32.308
SAM: Oh, oh!

4426
03:24:32.308 --> 03:24:33.880
Oh!

4427
03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:35.245
MATT: Essek stands up and he's like,

4428
03:24:35.245 --> 03:24:40.245
(brushes hands together) "I don't--

4429
03:24:40.328 --> 03:24:41.170
"I don't know what to say.

4430
03:24:41.170 --> 03:24:44.830
"This is very impressive."
LIAM: You are amazing.

4431
03:24:44.830 --> 03:24:47.630
This does not happen very often.

4432
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:50.713
This is history, pulled from history.

4433
03:24:52.810 --> 03:24:54.310
Thank you.

4434
03:24:54.310 --> 03:24:56.640
MATT: "Well, you had done most
of the legwork yourselves."

4435
03:24:57.510 --> 03:24:59.730
SAM: Thank you both for this.

4436
03:24:59.730 --> 03:25:02.483
Can we do it?

4437
03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:05.680
LIAM: What are the features of this?

4438
03:25:05.680 --> 03:25:07.630
Time--
MATT: You--

4439
03:25:07.630 --> 03:25:09.810
LIAM: Need-- requirements and components.

4440
03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:14.530
MATT: The component for this requires

4441
03:25:15.470 --> 03:25:18.912
about 50 pounds of raw clay,

4442
03:25:20.940 --> 03:25:22.493
which the spell consumes.

4443
03:25:24.220 --> 03:25:25.620
As well as about

4444
03:25:28.125 --> 03:25:31.030
a hundred gold worth of ground gem dust,

4445
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:34.650
doesn't matter the gem, and it takes

4446
03:25:34.650 --> 03:25:37.317
about an hour to cast the spell.

4447
03:25:41.780 --> 03:25:42.980
SAM: What does it do?

4448
03:25:44.940 --> 03:25:46.970
MATT: I'll give you the specifics,

4449
03:25:46.970 --> 03:25:50.040
but the overall essence of the spell,

4450
03:25:50.040 --> 03:25:52.478
as you look over the final equation, is,

4451
03:25:52.478 --> 03:25:54.619
if done properly,

4452
03:25:54.619 --> 03:25:58.473
it is a permanent alteration

4453
03:25:58.473 --> 03:26:03.470
of the target's body from
one known humanoid race

4454
03:26:03.470 --> 03:26:05.245
to another.
SAM: Oh.

4455
03:26:10.150 --> 03:26:10.983
LIAM: Well.

4456
03:26:14.810 --> 03:26:16.690
(exhales) <i>Mein Gott.</i>

4457
03:26:16.690 --> 03:26:18.590
We need clay, I don't have any.

4458
03:26:18.590 --> 03:26:19.880
SAM: I don't have any.
LIAM: No.

4459
03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:22.000
You don't have that much clay, do you?

4460
03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:23.216
MATT: "I have a yard."

4461
03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:27.010
TALIESIN: I've got a shovel.
LAURA: You're not there.

4462
03:26:27.010 --> 03:26:28.240
TALIESIN: Oh shit, nevermind.

4463
03:26:28.240 --> 03:26:29.258
(laughter)

4464
03:26:29.258 --> 03:26:30.110
I was so into it.

4465
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:31.270
LIAM: A yard, he said?

4466
03:26:32.680 --> 03:26:35.892
LAURA: That's-- clay's just--
SAM: Dirt.

4467
03:26:37.514 --> 03:26:39.579
LAURA: A special kind of dirt.
LIAM: Do you--?

4468
03:26:42.120 --> 03:26:44.760
Caleb just pulls the goblin and the elf in

4469
03:26:44.760 --> 03:26:49.445
for just a huge hug and
then pulls us all out again.

4470
03:26:50.541 --> 03:26:53.350
Do you want to do this now or
do you want to think about it?

4471
03:26:53.350 --> 03:26:54.416
SAM: Ah...

4472
03:26:59.400 --> 03:27:02.575
Maybe I'll just give it a day.
Or an hour.

4473
03:27:03.575 --> 03:27:04.791
Or a day.

4474
03:27:07.370 --> 03:27:08.886
LIAM: Whatever you need.

4475
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:13.080
SAM: This is amazing.
Thank you so much.

4476
03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:14.980
Maybe I'll just give it a day, though.

4477
03:27:16.170 --> 03:27:18.003
Just to figure out...

4478
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:22.467
yeah, just a day.

4479
03:27:26.410 --> 03:27:27.243
Yeah.

4480
03:27:28.930 --> 03:27:30.700
Yeah, yeah.
LIAM: Yes.

4481
03:27:30.700 --> 03:27:33.287
SAM: We can do this tomorrow.
LIAM: Just deliberate on it

4482
03:27:33.287 --> 03:27:35.279
for a bit.
SAM: Yeah.

4483
03:27:37.870 --> 03:27:40.480
LIAM: You know, the others
are probably wondering--

4484
03:27:40.480 --> 03:27:42.870
MATT: "Yes, it has been
some time, my apologies."

4485
03:27:42.870 --> 03:27:45.462
LAURA: They're probably having,
like, a threesome.

4486
03:27:46.330 --> 03:27:48.330
TALIESIN: What do you mean?
TRAVIS: Pssh, I got the books!

4487
03:27:48.330 --> 03:27:49.484
No, I'm just kidding.

4488
03:27:49.484 --> 03:27:50.633
(laughter)

4489
03:27:50.633 --> 03:27:52.266
TALIESIN: Run!
LIAM: But, um--

4490
03:27:52.266 --> 03:27:55.300
ASHLEY: You think Essek and Nott and Caleb?

4491
03:27:55.300 --> 03:27:57.608
TALIESIN: For what?
LAURA: I mean, they could just be, you know,

4492
03:27:57.608 --> 03:27:59.050
having a real good time up there.

4493
03:27:59.050 --> 03:28:01.230
TALIESIN: I assume they are having
a really good time up there.

4494
03:28:01.230 --> 03:28:03.540
LAURA: So you probably think
they're having a threesome?

4495
03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:05.890
TALIESIN: I don't--
ASHLEY: Maybe they're churning butter.

4496
03:28:07.232 --> 03:28:08.273
TALIESIN: That'd be good because

4497
03:28:08.273 --> 03:28:10.822
I'd really like to make
another round of these crackers.

4498
03:28:10.822 --> 03:28:12.355
I feel like we can improve on this.

4499
03:28:12.355 --> 03:28:13.646
LAURA: Yeah, they need more sugar.

4500
03:28:13.646 --> 03:28:16.480
TALIESIN: A little bit more sugar, not what I did,

4501
03:28:16.480 --> 03:28:18.250
let's all forget what I did yesterday,

4502
03:28:18.250 --> 03:28:20.740
but we could-- we could-- oh, I got to

4503
03:28:20.740 --> 03:28:22.940
take a look at the kitchen, see what we got.

4504
03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:25.642
LIAM: We work well together.

4505
03:28:26.680 --> 03:28:28.230
We should explore other things.

4506
03:28:29.920 --> 03:28:31.153
Other things.

4507
03:28:34.280 --> 03:28:36.290
MATT: "I have some ideas.

4508
03:28:36.290 --> 03:28:38.332
"There are favors owed still.

4509
03:28:40.330 --> 03:28:42.638
"Anyway, let's get back to
the rest of your friends."

4510
03:28:42.638 --> 03:28:45.892
SAM: Yes, yes. They're probably
fucking down there or something.

4511
03:28:45.892 --> 03:28:47.162
(laughter)

4512
03:28:47.162 --> 03:28:48.763
LIAM: Probably having a fivesome.

4513
03:28:48.763 --> 03:28:50.320
(laughter)

4514
03:28:50.320 --> 03:28:53.330
MATT: Gather up the notes,
the finalization of the spell,

4515
03:28:53.330 --> 03:28:54.990
hands it to you, and you guys return.

4516
03:28:54.990 --> 03:28:56.650
You hear the door upstairs.

4517
03:28:56.650 --> 03:28:58.190
You go towards where you think

4518
03:28:58.190 --> 03:29:00.040
the kitchen might be and the door is locked.

4519
03:29:01.280 --> 03:29:03.679
TALIESIN: Well, this is half the problem right here.

4520
03:29:03.679 --> 03:29:05.809
(laughter)

4521
03:29:05.809 --> 03:29:07.476
LIAM: Fucking doors.

4522
03:29:08.320 --> 03:29:11.260
MATT: You hear the familiar
footsteps of Caleb and Nott.

4523
03:29:11.260 --> 03:29:13.640
LIAM: Caleb has Nott backpack-style with

4524
03:29:13.640 --> 03:29:16.220
a real spring in his step coming down the stairs.

4525
03:29:16.220 --> 03:29:17.720
LAURA: Hey!
SAM: Hey, sorry to keep you--

4526
03:29:17.720 --> 03:29:19.800
LAURA: Did you guys have so much fun?

4527
03:29:19.800 --> 03:29:23.010
SAM: We did, it's a lovely-- it's a lovely lab.

4528
03:29:23.010 --> 03:29:25.570
LAURA: Do you feel relaxed and carefree?

4529
03:29:25.570 --> 03:29:27.360
LIAM: Energized.
LAURA: Really?

4530
03:29:27.360 --> 03:29:29.373
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Oh shit, you were right.

4531
03:29:29.373 --> 03:29:31.206
LIAM: He is intelligent.

4532
03:29:31.206 --> 03:29:33.177
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

4533
03:29:33.177 --> 03:29:35.753
MARISHA: He knows his way around?
LAURA: And he can float!

4534
03:29:35.753 --> 03:29:36.853
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Just saying.

4535
03:29:36.853 --> 03:29:38.920
SAM: He's right over there.
LAURA: Oh, hi.

4536
03:29:38.920 --> 03:29:41.110
MATT: He's heading down after the two of them.

4537
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:43.537
TRAVIS: You seem like you're in a very good mood.

4538
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:48.050
SAM: Knowledge, knowledge can
do that to you, right?

4539
03:29:49.200 --> 03:29:51.517
TALIESIN: Everything go okay? Everything work out?

4540
03:29:51.517 --> 03:29:53.500
Where are we at?
LIAM: We-- I've learned things

4541
03:29:53.500 --> 03:29:57.310
that I did not know even an hour ago.

4542
03:29:57.310 --> 03:29:58.740
SAM: Yeah.

4543
03:29:58.740 --> 03:30:02.120
TRAVIS: You'll be happy to know
we didn't explore too far.

4544
03:30:02.120 --> 03:30:04.140
We did go upstairs and look at your sort of

4545
03:30:04.140 --> 03:30:06.550
bookshelves and your glass cases

4546
03:30:06.550 --> 03:30:09.390
and we tried to wander further but it's locked.

4547
03:30:09.390 --> 03:30:10.950
LAURA: They did, we stayed here.

4548
03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:13.000
We're very polite.
TRAVIS: Hey, we own that shit.

4549
03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:14.870
TALIESIN: Tried to find the kitchen.
TRAVIS: I'm curious.

4550
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:17.670
ASHLEY: I don't care what you keep in your home, so.

4551
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:20.030
MATT: "Well, I appreciate all of that, mostly.

4552
03:30:21.033 --> 03:30:26.033
(sighs) "But quite a discovery made by these two."

4553
03:30:26.720 --> 03:30:28.598
ASHLEY: Wha--
SAM: Mm-hmm.

4554
03:30:28.598 --> 03:30:30.023
TRAVIS: What discovery?

4555
03:30:30.972 --> 03:30:33.663
SAM: We may-- we may have
a way to, uh...

4556
03:30:35.262 --> 03:30:36.329
to fix me.

4557
03:30:36.329 --> 03:30:37.420
LAURA: (gasping)

4558
03:30:37.420 --> 03:30:38.644
SAM: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Really?

4559
03:30:38.644 --> 03:30:40.377
How do you feel about that?

4560
03:30:40.377 --> 03:30:43.440
SAM: You know, excited.
LAURA: Yeah?

4561
03:30:43.440 --> 03:30:46.310
TRAVIS: The permanent fix you've
been looking for this whole time?

4562
03:30:46.310 --> 03:30:47.530
SAM: So it seems, yeah.

4563
03:30:47.530 --> 03:30:51.170
MARISHA: Back to your original form?
SAM: Uh huh.

4564
03:30:51.170 --> 03:30:53.110
TRAVIS: Essek, that's incredible.
MARISHA: Wow.

4565
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:55.660
MATT: "Don't look at me, I
was merely a final catalyst.

4566
03:30:55.660 --> 03:30:58.890
"This is work they had already continued from--"

4567
03:30:58.890 --> 03:31:00.981
SAM: Well, it's mostly Caleb.
LIAM: You are-- you are both

4568
03:31:00.981 --> 03:31:02.760
downplaying your contribution.

4569
03:31:02.760 --> 03:31:04.380
MATT: "Well, if we're going to be honest,

4570
03:31:04.380 --> 03:31:07.320
"the biggest contribution here is a...

4571
03:31:07.320 --> 03:31:09.802
"mage long before our time."

4572
03:31:10.650 --> 03:31:12.638
TRAVIS: Oh, Halas.
LIAM: True.

4573
03:31:13.850 --> 03:31:16.740
True, standing on the shoulders of giants.

4574
03:31:16.740 --> 03:31:17.573
MATT: "Indeed."

4575
03:31:19.870 --> 03:31:21.157
TALIESIN: Very hard, they're very aggressive.

4576
03:31:21.157 --> 03:31:25.190
TRAVIS: Are we--? If we were successful, yes, are you--

4577
03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:27.470
LAURA: Yeah, why aren't you--
why aren't you already changed?

4578
03:31:27.470 --> 03:31:30.510
SAM: I just, I just need to
maybe let it sit for a second,

4579
03:31:30.510 --> 03:31:35.240
just think about what this would, you know.

4580
03:31:35.240 --> 03:31:36.190
I'm going to do it.

4581
03:31:36.190 --> 03:31:38.151
Of course, I'll do it, I'll do it,

4582
03:31:38.151 --> 03:31:40.890
I just, you know, where there's risks involved.

4583
03:31:40.890 --> 03:31:42.920
We've never done it before.
LAURA: Yeah, what is the risk?

4584
03:31:42.920 --> 03:31:44.670
What happens if it's not successful?

4585
03:31:44.670 --> 03:31:46.200
SAM: Who knows?
LAURA: Do you accidentally

4586
03:31:46.200 --> 03:31:49.580
turn into a wooly mammoth or something?

4587
03:31:49.580 --> 03:31:52.078
SAM: I don't think so, there's not enough clay for that.

4588
03:31:52.078 --> 03:31:53.965
MATT: Gathering-- looking at the equation,

4589
03:31:53.965 --> 03:31:56.910
if done correctly, there's no drawback

4590
03:31:56.910 --> 03:31:59.240
beyond just the cost of materials lost.

4591
03:31:59.240 --> 03:32:00.073
LAURA: Wow.

4592
03:32:00.073 --> 03:32:01.860
SAM: Yeah, but, I mean,
we don't know that, right?

4593
03:32:01.860 --> 03:32:03.501
We don't know, so.

4594
03:32:03.501 --> 03:32:08.170
LIAM: Oh, do any of you
have crushed gem dust left?

4595
03:32:08.170 --> 03:32:09.490
We did have some.
TALIESIN: I'll have to take a look.

4596
03:32:09.490 --> 03:32:14.485
LAURA: We did. We used a lot
of it for, you know, our tattoos.

4597
03:32:15.842 --> 03:32:19.525
LIAM: Don't need much, about a hundred gold pieces worth.

4598
03:32:19.525 --> 03:32:22.210
TALIESIN: Can't be that hard to find.
LIAM: No.

4599
03:32:22.210 --> 03:32:25.558
SAM: I have a diamond worth 50 gold.

4600
03:32:26.640 --> 03:32:28.990
LAURA: I don't have any dust left,

4601
03:32:30.480 --> 03:32:33.360
but we can find some.
TALIESIN: That shouldn't be too hard.

4602
03:32:33.360 --> 03:32:34.193
LIAM: Certainly.

4603
03:32:34.193 --> 03:32:36.380
And it seems like you want to, you know,

4604
03:32:36.380 --> 03:32:39.430
just prepare yourself
because it's been so long--

4605
03:32:39.430 --> 03:32:40.670
SAM: Well also, we don't
have any-- we don't have

4606
03:32:40.670 --> 03:32:42.780
the materials so we
can't do it now anyway.

4607
03:32:42.780 --> 03:32:44.290
TRAVIS: What are the materials needed?

4608
03:32:44.290 --> 03:32:45.970
LIAM: We need clay, which Essek is saying

4609
03:32:45.970 --> 03:32:49.120
he could provide for us.
SAM: A <i>lot</i> of clay, yeah.

4610
03:32:49.120 --> 03:32:49.953
TRAVIS: Okay.

4611
03:32:49.953 --> 03:32:51.530
LIAM: Which he could provide to us.

4612
03:32:51.530 --> 03:32:53.400
And then we would need to get some gemstone dust,

4613
03:32:53.400 --> 03:32:55.932
which either we have some or, um,

4614
03:32:55.932 --> 03:32:58.596
this is a very large, beautiful city.

4615
03:32:58.596 --> 03:33:00.196
I'm sure that we could acquire some.

4616
03:33:00.196 --> 03:33:03.163
TRAVIS: Do you need to be here
in order to perform this spell

4617
03:33:03.163 --> 03:33:05.550
or is it something you want to--
SAM: I don't think so.

4618
03:33:05.550 --> 03:33:07.038
TRAVIS: Travel with and--

4619
03:33:08.690 --> 03:33:11.200
TALIESIN: That's a lot of-- I don't know.

4620
03:33:11.200 --> 03:33:12.490
LIAM: Well--
MARISHA: So you can get clay.

4621
03:33:13.493 --> 03:33:16.178
LIAM: I would recommend doing it--

4622
03:33:17.610 --> 03:33:18.860
TRAVIS: Controlled.
LIAM: Doing it here or somewhere--

4623
03:33:18.860 --> 03:33:21.650
yes, a controlled environment.

4624
03:33:21.650 --> 03:33:23.575
TRAVIS: How long do you need?
SAM: An hour.

4625
03:33:24.777 --> 03:33:26.398
LAURA: Wow.
SAM: I know, right?

4626
03:33:26.398 --> 03:33:28.790
LAURA: No, but you could do it right now.

4627
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:31.230
We just go out, probably, just go out

4628
03:33:31.230 --> 03:33:33.330
and get some gem dust
while people start digging.

4629
03:33:33.330 --> 03:33:34.163
SAM: Yeah.

4630
03:33:34.163 --> 03:33:36.650
TRAVIS: Do you want to go
source another 50 gold of gems

4631
03:33:36.650 --> 03:33:40.270
and I could assist Essek
and certainly Caduceus could

4632
03:33:40.270 --> 03:33:43.050
help us gather how much--
how much clay in particular?

4633
03:33:43.050 --> 03:33:44.339
LAURA: Lots of clay?
SAM: 50 pounds.

4634
03:33:44.339 --> 03:33:46.580
LIAM: 50 pounds, right?
MARISHA: Oh, that's not too bad.

4635
03:33:47.530 --> 03:33:51.790
ASHLEY: Nott, I feel like you're hesitant.

4636
03:33:51.790 --> 03:33:53.880
SAM: Well yeah, I mean, of course.

4637
03:33:53.880 --> 03:33:56.260
It's just been a long time coming.

4638
03:33:56.260 --> 03:33:59.990
I didn't think, like,
this morning would be the time.

4639
03:34:01.990 --> 03:34:05.200
I sort of assumed that it would be an ordeal

4640
03:34:05.200 --> 03:34:08.925
and I'd have to die or something to do it again.

4641
03:34:10.060 --> 03:34:12.260
And so, it's, it's just odd that it's so--

4642
03:34:13.100 --> 03:34:14.658
LAURA: Doable?

4643
03:34:14.658 --> 03:34:15.499
SAM: Easy.

4644
03:34:15.499 --> 03:34:19.999
LIAM: Well, after months of
traveling together and--

4645
03:34:21.207 --> 03:34:22.190
LAURA: Wow.

4646
03:34:23.828 --> 03:34:26.330
MARISHA: I mean, you already died once.

4647
03:34:26.330 --> 03:34:28.650
SAM: No, I don't <i>want</i>
to die again, trust me.

4648
03:34:28.650 --> 03:34:29.916
I just, uh...

4649
03:34:32.940 --> 03:34:35.071
LAURA: Are you kind of used
to being in this body now?

4650
03:34:35.071 --> 03:34:37.710
SAM: No, I hate this body, it's awful.

4651
03:34:37.710 --> 03:34:41.600
It's just, what do I--
you know, what do I do after?

4652
03:34:41.600 --> 03:34:43.860
LAURA: You stay with us for a little bit.

4653
03:34:43.860 --> 03:34:46.430
You help us keep doing what we are doing,

4654
03:34:46.430 --> 03:34:48.070
you just look different.

4655
03:34:48.070 --> 03:34:51.275
SAM: Why would I do that?
LAURA: Because you love us.

4656
03:34:51.275 --> 03:34:53.870
MARISHA: Are you afraid that if you

4657
03:34:53.870 --> 03:34:57.500
get your old body back that it means--

4658
03:34:58.486 --> 03:35:03.472
LAURA: You got to go leave us
and go back to Yeza and your son?

4659
03:35:04.480 --> 03:35:07.700
MARISHA: Because that's, like,
totally a manifested condition

4660
03:35:07.700 --> 03:35:09.550
that you're putting on the situation.

4661
03:35:11.256 --> 03:35:12.600
SAM: Not really.
LAURA: But also, I understand.

4662
03:35:12.600 --> 03:35:15.260
It is important, you know, you have a son.

4663
03:35:15.260 --> 03:35:16.820
SAM: No, I know.
LAURA: He misses you.

4664
03:35:16.820 --> 03:35:17.970
SAM: I know.

4665
03:35:19.020 --> 03:35:20.520
LAURA: That is a--
LIAM: It's hard for a--

4666
03:35:20.520 --> 03:35:21.353
LAURA: Conundrum.

4667
03:35:21.353 --> 03:35:24.260
LIAM: Hard for a son to
be away from a mother.

4668
03:35:24.260 --> 03:35:27.075
SAM: I want to be there.
TRAVIS: What about this?

4669
03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:33.330
You've done so much with us
and it feels like we're close

4670
03:35:33.330 --> 03:35:38.220
to achieving a historic peace
treaty between two nations.

4671
03:35:38.220 --> 03:35:41.228
Maybe that's the punctuation
mark you're looking for?

4672
03:35:42.820 --> 03:35:45.070
SAM: Yeah, like one last run.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4673
03:35:45.070 --> 03:35:47.030
LAURA: Traveler Con?
TRAVIS: The last chapter in--

4674
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:50.221
LAURA: Really important.
TRAVIS: --this book of adventures for you.

4675
03:35:50.221 --> 03:35:51.421
MARISHA: Getting your body back

4676
03:35:51.421 --> 03:35:53.870
just doesn't have to be
a final pin in the story,

4677
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:56.890
is all I'm trying to say.
TRAVIS: We certainly need you.

4678
03:35:56.890 --> 03:35:59.100
We'd be shortsighted.

4679
03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:00.400
LIAM: But we-- you--

4680
03:36:00.400 --> 03:36:01.735
(sighs)

4681
03:36:01.735 --> 03:36:03.201
You know, we wouldn't

4682
03:36:04.545 --> 03:36:07.900
judge you if you wanted
to stay with us for awhile.

4683
03:36:07.900 --> 03:36:09.400
MARISHA: Or if you wanted to go home.

4684
03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:13.840
LIAM: Yeah, but if you wanted
to stay with us for awhile.

4685
03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:15.750
SAM: Yeah, I-- I do.

4686
03:36:17.440 --> 03:36:18.590
Of course I do.

4687
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:20.770
I just don't--

4688
03:36:23.330 --> 03:36:24.163
I want--

4689
03:36:25.290 --> 03:36:26.953
what I want is

4690
03:36:28.840 --> 03:36:32.610
just contrary to what--
what we've been doing,

4691
03:36:32.610 --> 03:36:34.860
and so it's just a bit
of a change, you know?

4692
03:36:36.280 --> 03:36:37.113
Um...

4693
03:36:38.850 --> 03:36:40.810
I mean, yeah, you're right,
I suppose I could just

4694
03:36:40.810 --> 03:36:44.240
change, you know, just
change my body, right,

4695
03:36:44.240 --> 03:36:48.210
and then continue on with
you guys just for a little bit,

4696
03:36:48.210 --> 03:36:50.432
until we come to a--

4697
03:36:51.690 --> 03:36:53.248
a spot where--

4698
03:36:54.780 --> 03:36:55.940
where that's it.

4699
03:36:55.940 --> 03:36:58.706
LIAM: Well, you know we would, um,

4700
03:36:59.615 --> 03:37:01.898
be ensuring peace

4701
03:37:03.240 --> 03:37:04.700
for your family, for your son,

4702
03:37:04.700 --> 03:37:07.720
for the Empire, if we pull this off.

4703
03:37:07.720 --> 03:37:10.748
That is commendable.

4704
03:37:12.670 --> 03:37:13.503
SAM: Yeah.

4705
03:37:16.730 --> 03:37:17.721
Uh, yeah.

4706
03:37:20.050 --> 03:37:21.308
Let's do it, then.

4707
03:37:26.550 --> 03:37:28.075
LIAM: Um, Nott, could you...

4708
03:37:30.860 --> 03:37:33.055
show us what you looked like?

4709
03:37:35.460 --> 03:37:36.984
SAM: Yeah, of course.

4710
03:37:36.984 --> 03:37:37.817
Uh...

4711
03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:44.130
Yeah, I'll transform into Veth.

4712
03:37:44.130 --> 03:37:45.913
MATT: And you've seen Veth--

4713
03:37:45.913 --> 03:37:49.080
the illusion of Veth before many times.

4714
03:37:49.080 --> 03:37:50.640
A very clear vision of the beautiful

4715
03:37:50.640 --> 03:37:53.372
half-elf girl, sorry, halfling girl.

4716
03:37:53.372 --> 03:37:55.084
SAM: Mm-hmm.

4717
03:37:55.084 --> 03:37:56.600
LIAM: (sighs)

4718
03:37:56.600 --> 03:37:58.750
SAM: Hi.
LAURA: Hi.

4719
03:37:58.750 --> 03:38:01.270
LIAM: Caleb, a little shaky, but walks around

4720
03:38:01.270 --> 03:38:06.255
and just gets every detail and angle.

4721
03:38:06.255 --> 03:38:08.290
SAM: Do <i>you</i> have to do this?

4722
03:38:08.290 --> 03:38:10.010
<i>You</i> have to do this.

4723
03:38:10.010 --> 03:38:13.237
The spellcaster has to choose the form,

4724
03:38:14.400 --> 03:38:16.620
is that how this works?

4725
03:38:16.620 --> 03:38:17.560
LIAM: I would think so.

4726
03:38:17.560 --> 03:38:20.650
MATT: It's kind of a combination of the two.

4727
03:38:20.650 --> 03:38:22.610
If the spellcaster wants, it can be

4728
03:38:22.610 --> 03:38:26.010
entirely of their making.

4729
03:38:26.010 --> 03:38:27.753
MATT: But, uh--

4730
03:38:27.753 --> 03:38:31.970
it could be a mutual
agreed upon scenario.

4731
03:38:31.970 --> 03:38:35.950
It's the idea between--
the spell, in theory,

4732
03:38:35.950 --> 03:38:40.070
could be put upon somebody
without their consent.

4733
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:43.251
LAURA: It might be what
happened to her before?

4734
03:38:43.251 --> 03:38:46.240
MATT: It was a different type of experience.

4735
03:38:46.240 --> 03:38:48.033
So, in theory, the spell can be used

4736
03:38:48.033 --> 03:38:49.383
to transform somebody against their will,

4737
03:38:49.383 --> 03:38:52.490
but that would be-- that
would involve a saving throw.

4738
03:38:52.490 --> 03:38:56.057
If it is something that you are
consenting with the caster on,

4739
03:38:56.057 --> 03:38:58.200
then the form can be agreed upon in essentially

4740
03:38:58.200 --> 03:39:01.740
a shared vision and no saving throw required.

4741
03:39:01.740 --> 03:39:04.540
LIAM: We'll do what we always do,
we'll do it together.

4742
03:39:04.540 --> 03:39:06.964
SAM: Mm-hmm, yeah.

4743
03:39:06.964 --> 03:39:09.250
LIAM: Caleb and Nott.

4744
03:39:09.250 --> 03:39:10.358
SAM: All right.

4745
03:39:11.410 --> 03:39:12.585
I guess...

4746
03:39:13.476 --> 03:39:15.367
do you own a shovel?

4747
03:39:16.420 --> 03:39:20.630
TALIESIN: I have, I have a shovel.
LAURA: You just carry it around?

4748
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:22.400
Where does it--
TALIESIN: It's on my belt,

4749
03:39:22.400 --> 03:39:24.050
it's just a little folding thing.

4750
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:26.066
LIAM: Used to live in a cemetery.
LAURA: That's true.

4751
03:39:26.066 --> 03:39:29.132
ASHLEY: Yeah, Nott, we can--
Caduceus and I can go to town.

4752
03:39:29.132 --> 03:39:31.416
LAURA: I can go find some gem dust for you.

4753
03:39:31.416 --> 03:39:34.908
SAM: That would be nice.
MARISHA: I'll help team clay.

4754
03:39:34.908 --> 03:39:36.156
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4755
03:39:36.156 --> 03:39:38.020
LAURA: Think you can find
some gem dust with me, Fjord?

4756
03:39:38.020 --> 03:39:40.120
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah.
SAM: Yeah, he can't dig, so, yeah.

4757
03:39:40.120 --> 03:39:41.262
TRAVIS: What?

4758
03:39:41.262 --> 03:39:42.928
SAM: I mean, come on.

4759
03:39:44.253 --> 03:39:45.086
TRAVIS: Oh--

4760
03:39:45.086 --> 03:39:48.544
(laughter)

4761
03:39:48.544 --> 03:39:50.741
(laughter)

4762
03:39:51.766 --> 03:39:55.708
I will go with Jester, find some gems.

4763
03:39:57.397 --> 03:40:00.917
I will find nothing but cubic
zirconia for your bitch ass.

4764
03:40:00.917 --> 03:40:02.450
(laughter)

4765
03:40:02.450 --> 03:40:04.266
LIAM: She comes out like a Picasso.

4766
03:40:04.266 --> 03:40:05.186
(laughter)

4767
03:40:05.186 --> 03:40:06.625
TRAVIS: I don't know why it didn't work!

4768
03:40:06.625 --> 03:40:08.417
(laughter)

4769
03:40:09.560 --> 03:40:11.150
MATT: It's an easy enough shopping trip

4770
03:40:11.150 --> 03:40:13.710
since the gems themselves are not specific.

4771
03:40:13.710 --> 03:40:15.250
It's just a certain worth of it.

4772
03:40:16.287 --> 03:40:17.220
Once again, requesting them crushed up

4773
03:40:17.220 --> 03:40:19.540
by another jeweler is a unique reaction,

4774
03:40:19.540 --> 03:40:22.350
but you acquire the gem dust easy enough.

4775
03:40:23.280 --> 03:40:26.460
Through the rapid conjuring of water

4776
03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:31.080
and the group aid, you are able to

4777
03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:34.050
both help facilitate and excise

4778
03:40:34.050 --> 03:40:38.795
enough clay to facilitate the spell.

4779
03:40:40.080 --> 03:40:43.380
Within less than an hour,
the materials have been gathered.

4780
03:40:45.030 --> 03:40:46.710
SAM: What time of day is it?

4781
03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:50.050
MATT: At this point, early afternoon.

4782
03:40:50.050 --> 03:40:51.420
Yeah, about early afternoon,

4783
03:40:51.420 --> 03:40:53.320
two o'clock, three o'clock, maybe.

4784
03:40:54.297 --> 03:40:57.729
MARISHA: You want to do this right now
or you still want to sleep on it?

4785
03:40:59.204 --> 03:41:00.810
SAM: I mean, it's the best place to do it,

4786
03:41:00.810 --> 03:41:04.380
in a powerful mage's tower, right?

4787
03:41:04.380 --> 03:41:06.000
MARISHA: We don't have to leave town immediately

4788
03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:07.710
if you wanted to stay here and sleep on it.

4789
03:41:07.710 --> 03:41:10.109
TALIESIN: There's no judgment, you

4790
03:41:10.109 --> 03:41:13.060
don't need to make this decision right away.

4791
03:41:13.060 --> 03:41:13.969
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4792
03:41:13.969 --> 03:41:15.770
TRAVIS: You should do it
when it feels right, too.

4793
03:41:15.770 --> 03:41:17.790
MARISHA: Yasha, you all right?

4794
03:41:17.790 --> 03:41:20.290
ASHLEY: I don't know why, this
is making me weirdly sad.

4795
03:41:22.043 --> 03:41:24.005
SAM: I mean, yeah.

4796
03:41:25.120 --> 03:41:26.481
This has been, uh,

4797
03:41:28.617 --> 03:41:32.095
we've had adventures together

4798
03:41:32.095 --> 03:41:35.218
and loss and success and, um...

4799
03:41:36.703 --> 03:41:39.400
I don't know how I'll
be after this, you know?

4800
03:41:39.400 --> 03:41:42.475
MARISHA: I guess, in a weird way, you are--

4801
03:41:43.650 --> 03:41:46.838
a version of you is dying

4802
03:41:49.162 --> 03:41:50.662
in order to complete this.

4803
03:41:52.330 --> 03:41:53.730
SAM: I don't know if I'll--

4804
03:41:55.943 --> 03:41:58.195
I mean, I won't look the same,
obviously, but I don't know if

4805
03:41:58.195 --> 03:42:01.811
I'll think the same about...

4806
03:42:02.960 --> 03:42:03.960
you all.

4807
03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:05.751
LAURA: Why wouldn't you?
You're the same you.

4808
03:42:05.751 --> 03:42:06.590
SAM: I don't know that.

4809
03:42:06.590 --> 03:42:08.080
LAURA: Just your body's going to be different.

4810
03:42:08.080 --> 03:42:09.722
SAM: I don't know that.

4811
03:42:13.690 --> 03:42:16.870
I've had all sorts of different feelings

4812
03:42:16.870 --> 03:42:20.770
and things happen to me
since becoming this form

4813
03:42:20.770 --> 03:42:22.510
and I don't know what's what anymore.

4814
03:42:22.510 --> 03:42:23.785
It all feels...

4815
03:42:25.140 --> 03:42:27.198
I don't know, normal now.

4816
03:42:28.624 --> 03:42:32.107
You treat me normal, everyone
around here treats me normal.

4817
03:42:33.350 --> 03:42:35.342
ASHLEY: That's because you are.

4818
03:42:38.562 --> 03:42:40.500
TALIESIN: It's just which normal you want.

4819
03:42:40.500 --> 03:42:41.333
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4820
03:42:42.890 --> 03:42:47.890
SAM: But what if I'm not as agile, nimble?

4821
03:42:47.930 --> 03:42:52.930
What if I can't aim as
quickly or hide as easily?

4822
03:42:53.850 --> 03:42:56.013
TALIESIN: Your aim's kind of iffy anyway, I--

4823
03:42:57.150 --> 03:42:59.727
SAM: Wish I'd have got another
one of those explosive ones.

4824
03:42:59.727 --> 03:43:00.590
LAURA: (chuckling)

4825
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:04.465
TALIESIN: Kind of glad you don't.
MARISHA: If you trade out a few traits,

4826
03:43:06.081 --> 03:43:08.322
you're not going to be left without.

4827
03:43:10.970 --> 03:43:12.390
SAM: Are you sure about that?

4828
03:43:12.390 --> 03:43:15.390
LIAM: You will be a member
of The Mighty Nein.

4829
03:43:16.340 --> 03:43:18.533
You will be our friend.

4830
03:43:20.380 --> 03:43:24.100
SAM: Not if I can't shoot
or I can't pick locks or--

4831
03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:28.605
TRAVIS: I think I know what you're saying.

4832
03:43:31.400 --> 03:43:35.310
I had to make a choice
and it changed everything,

4833
03:43:35.310 --> 03:43:38.490
no certainty of what
was on the other side.

4834
03:43:38.490 --> 03:43:42.000
You've been trying so
hard to get to this point

4835
03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:44.500
and you have the ability now.

4836
03:43:44.500 --> 03:43:47.500
There's no reason for
you to do it immediately.

4837
03:43:47.500 --> 03:43:49.980
Unless you absolutely
are sure you want to

4838
03:43:49.980 --> 03:43:53.587
and the time is right,
then you shouldn't.

4839
03:43:54.440 --> 03:43:57.910
Otherwise, that uncertainty
could lead to regret

4840
03:43:57.910 --> 03:44:00.190
or anything else that
you couldn't predict.

4841
03:44:00.190 --> 03:44:02.890
Wait if you're not ready.

4842
03:44:02.890 --> 03:44:04.473
We're here for you.

4843
03:44:13.210 --> 03:44:15.420
SAM: I guess the thing
I'm most scared of is if...

4844
03:44:16.810 --> 03:44:18.426
if I change,

4845
03:44:20.127 --> 03:44:21.835
I won't want to stay.

4846
03:44:25.026 --> 03:44:27.193
LIAM: (sighs)

4847
03:44:29.096 --> 03:44:32.071
TALIESIN: Well, that would be okay, too.

4848
03:44:33.231 --> 03:44:35.898
LIAM: Nott, I don't think any of us can

4849
03:44:37.820 --> 03:44:40.830
give you that answer and you know that,

4850
03:44:40.830 --> 03:44:42.838
but whatever you want to do,

4851
03:44:45.400 --> 03:44:46.739
we're here.

4852
03:44:54.860 --> 03:44:56.243
SAM: I love you all.

4853
03:44:59.170 --> 03:45:00.285
Let's do it.

4854
03:45:08.690 --> 03:45:11.660
MARISHA: Do you want bigger
tits this time around?

4855
03:45:11.660 --> 03:45:15.000
SAM: Yep.
LAURA: They're really big, I mean.

4856
03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:17.330
SAM: Every man likes even a little bigger.

4857
03:45:17.330 --> 03:45:19.110
LAURA: I don't think that's necessarily true.

4858
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:21.510
SAM: Well, Yeza does, he--
LAURA: He likes big--

4859
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:25.400
ASHLEY: Make them how you want them,
don't do it for anybody else.

4860
03:45:25.400 --> 03:45:27.770
SAM: You know what, you're right.

4861
03:45:27.770 --> 03:45:29.160
It'll hurt my back.

4862
03:45:29.160 --> 03:45:30.900
I'll just make them a little smaller.

4863
03:45:30.900 --> 03:45:32.942
ASHLEY: You might be more
agile if they're--

4864
03:45:32.942 --> 03:45:34.516
LAURA: Make them however
you want it to be.

4865
03:45:34.516 --> 03:45:35.349
SAM: Yeah.

4866
03:45:37.801 --> 03:45:40.550
MARISHA: I mean, titties
are just great, regardless.

4867
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:41.908
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: For sure.

4868
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:45.370
ASHLEY: All shapes and sizes are good.
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

4869
03:45:45.370 --> 03:45:47.400
ASHLEY: Small ones, big ones, dangly ones.

4870
03:45:47.400 --> 03:45:50.648
MARISHA: I'll mold your titties, if you
want me to be in charge of that.

4871
03:45:50.648 --> 03:45:52.130
SAM: You'll mold my titties?

4872
03:45:52.130 --> 03:45:53.668
MARISHA: Well, I'm assuming
we have to make, like,

4873
03:45:53.668 --> 03:45:56.180
a clay version of the
view you want to turn into.

4874
03:45:56.180 --> 03:45:58.137
I'm totally just making this shit up.

4875
03:45:58.137 --> 03:45:59.823
MATT: That's not all how it works.

4876
03:45:59.823 --> 03:46:01.810
(laughter)

4877
03:46:01.810 --> 03:46:04.690
SAM: If that is the case,
then I absolutely

4878
03:46:04.690 --> 03:46:07.800
want Beau to mold my
titties and no one else

4879
03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:10.310
because she has the
most experience with them.

4880
03:46:10.310 --> 03:46:11.344
(laughter)

4881
03:46:11.344 --> 03:46:13.027
And she's got deft, deft fingers and hands--

4882
03:46:13.027 --> 03:46:14.843
ASHLEY: That might not entirely be true.

4883
03:46:14.843 --> 03:46:15.746
(laughter)

4884
03:46:15.746 --> 03:46:17.529
TALIESIN: Oh!
SAM: Do tell.

4885
03:46:17.529 --> 03:46:19.217
(laughter)

4886
03:46:19.217 --> 03:46:21.787
ASHLEY: That's a story for another time.

4887
03:46:21.787 --> 03:46:23.320
MARISHA: We'll swap titty tales.

4888
03:46:23.320 --> 03:46:24.787
TALIESIN: Her name was Crayola.

4889
03:46:26.268 --> 03:46:27.766
ASHLEY: Her name was Cerulean.

4890
03:46:27.766 --> 03:46:30.256
(laughter)

4891
03:46:30.256 --> 03:46:31.872
(chuckling)

4892
03:46:35.458 --> 03:46:38.849
MATT: "I suppose I will go
prepare the chamber, and um..."

4893
03:46:38.849 --> 03:46:40.007
(clears throat)

4894
03:46:42.007 --> 03:46:46.353
And he goes ahead and lifts
a hand towards the hunk of clay.

4895
03:46:47.580 --> 03:46:50.787
"If I could have some help?"
TALIESIN: Hmm, yeah, right.

4896
03:46:50.787 --> 03:46:52.400
MATT: You lift it and it's half the weight

4897
03:46:52.400 --> 03:46:54.845
it was before you grabbed it.

4898
03:46:55.770 --> 03:46:56.603
"Come."

4899
03:46:57.869 --> 03:46:59.252
TALIESIN: Is that right?
MATT: Heading upstairs.

4900
03:46:59.252 --> 03:47:00.169
TALIESIN: All right.

4901
03:47:00.169 --> 03:47:02.102
MARISHA: "Is that right?" (laughs)

4902
03:47:03.127 --> 03:47:04.510
TALIESIN: It feels light, but.

4903
03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:08.740
MATT: You all follow?
LAURA: Yeah.

4904
03:47:08.740 --> 03:47:09.640
LIAM: Yeah.

4905
03:47:11.720 --> 03:47:13.980
MATT: Heading back into the research chamber

4906
03:47:13.980 --> 03:47:17.090
where you had completed this equation,

4907
03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:20.070
you begin setting up exactly the ritual that

4908
03:47:20.070 --> 03:47:23.740
you had partially uncovered, partially designed.

4909
03:47:25.210 --> 03:47:27.280
Arranging all manner of materials,

4910
03:47:27.280 --> 03:47:30.570
taking the clay itself and molding it into

4911
03:47:30.570 --> 03:47:34.445
essentially a small trough, if you will,

4912
03:47:35.760 --> 03:47:40.545
to contain Nott as part of the ritual.

4913
03:47:42.370 --> 03:47:44.820
Eventually, you set up
the right incense to burn,

4914
03:47:46.010 --> 03:47:49.110
the light in the chamber
is closed with a curtain,

4915
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:52.700
and as you finish preparations,

4916
03:47:52.700 --> 03:47:54.825
it is set for the hour ritual.

4917
03:47:57.760 --> 03:48:00.990
LIAM: I crouch down before her.

4918
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:04.311
Nott the Brave,

4919
03:48:06.660 --> 03:48:08.051
Veth Brenatto,

4920
03:48:09.660 --> 03:48:11.140
you are here.

4921
03:48:11.140 --> 03:48:13.215
And he taps just above her heart.

4922
03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:16.279
And you are here.

4923
03:48:16.279 --> 03:48:18.321
He touches just between her eyes.

4924
03:48:20.580 --> 03:48:25.150
You are you and you
will continue to be you.

4925
03:48:28.360 --> 03:48:29.660
And we are here.

4926
03:48:32.010 --> 03:48:32.843
You ready?

4927
03:48:34.556 --> 03:48:36.723
SAM: (deep breath)

4928
03:48:39.660 --> 03:48:42.160
I'll just-- I lean forward and

4929
03:48:43.526 --> 03:48:45.934
sweetly kiss him on the lips

4930
03:48:46.993 --> 03:48:49.593
and say,

4931
03:48:50.684 --> 03:48:54.316
Thank you, Caleb, for getting me this far

4932
03:48:54.316 --> 03:48:58.366
and for devoting yourself to--

4933
03:48:59.416 --> 03:49:00.532
to me.

4934
03:49:03.130 --> 03:49:04.438
You're a good man

4935
03:49:09.050 --> 03:49:09.883
and I--

4936
03:49:12.700 --> 03:49:15.691
I hope you find
where you're going, too.

4937
03:49:20.972 --> 03:49:22.320
(sighing)

4938
03:49:22.320 --> 03:49:23.420
All right.

4939
03:49:24.561 --> 03:49:26.450
Do the thing.

4940
03:49:26.450 --> 03:49:29.010
LIAM: Cups the side of her cheek.

4941
03:49:29.010 --> 03:49:30.710
This will be our best trick yet.

4942
03:49:31.843 --> 03:49:33.313
SAM: We have to name it.

4943
03:49:35.220 --> 03:49:37.830
MATT: Preparing, as you pull the sleeves back,

4944
03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:41.010
you take the scattered elements of the crushed gems

4945
03:49:41.010 --> 03:49:43.657
and place them across Nott's body

4946
03:49:43.657 --> 03:49:46.648
as you lay down into the clay.

4947
03:49:46.648 --> 03:49:48.710
SAM: That's wet.

4948
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:52.476
MATT: The ritual begins

4949
03:49:52.476 --> 03:49:54.442
as the lines begin to

4950
03:49:54.442 --> 03:49:57.610
draw around, the incantations begin.

4951
03:49:57.610 --> 03:49:59.210
All of you sit back and watch

4952
03:49:59.210 --> 03:50:00.710
as the wind begins to pick up.

4953
03:50:01.870 --> 03:50:03.190
The temperature shifts and alters,

4954
03:50:03.190 --> 03:50:05.450
the cold of the clay
heats around your body,

4955
03:50:05.450 --> 03:50:08.009
and you feel it begin to actually move.

4956
03:50:08.009 --> 03:50:09.842
You watch as the clay begins to slowly

4957
03:50:09.842 --> 03:50:11.817
almost melt in reverse, upward,

4958
03:50:11.817 --> 03:50:15.717
and then eventually encasing
elements of Nott's body.

4959
03:50:16.610 --> 03:50:20.620
As the magic begins to swirl and gather,

4960
03:50:20.620 --> 03:50:24.860
minutes seem to stretch
longer than you expected.

4961
03:50:24.860 --> 03:50:27.110
It's a place where time momentarily

4962
03:50:27.110 --> 03:50:30.890
seems to not really have an impact.

4963
03:50:30.890 --> 03:50:33.230
Words you try and speak draw out slowly.

4964
03:50:34.410 --> 03:50:37.590
As part of this ritual,
it's an encapsulation within itself

4965
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:39.888
and all of you are just bystanders

4966
03:50:39.888 --> 03:50:42.946
watching a new magic be birthed.

4967
03:50:44.820 --> 03:50:46.380
As you progress, you reach out

4968
03:50:46.380 --> 03:50:50.280
and extend your thoughts towards Nott,

4969
03:50:50.280 --> 03:50:52.980
and Nott, you concentrate and focus on

4970
03:50:52.980 --> 03:50:55.730
the image of who you truly are,
in the heart of hearts.

4971
03:50:57.220 --> 03:51:00.478
As you feel the clay begin to cool

4972
03:51:00.478 --> 03:51:03.403
and turn cold around you,

4973
03:51:03.403 --> 03:51:06.030
you engage the second element of the spell.

4974
03:51:06.030 --> 03:51:09.190
Now, the woven threads of arcane power

4975
03:51:09.190 --> 03:51:13.000
pierce the clay and pierce Nott's body

4976
03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:15.475
to begin the process of rearrangement.

4977
03:51:16.740 --> 03:51:18.880
Excitement begins to flow
through you at the knowledge

4978
03:51:18.880 --> 03:51:21.930
that you have the ability
at your fingertips to do this,

4979
03:51:21.930 --> 03:51:24.350
after so many times of discussing

4980
03:51:24.350 --> 03:51:26.750
and contemplating and daydreaming.

4981
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:29.623
This is the moment where
you are the surgeon at work.

4982
03:51:31.212 --> 03:51:34.932
And you go in for that first incision

4983
03:51:37.770 --> 03:51:39.303
and you're blocked.

4984
03:51:41.199 --> 03:51:42.465
And you pull

4985
03:51:44.241 --> 03:51:47.491
and it should be working and
you push again and you're blocked.

4986
03:51:48.850 --> 03:51:50.680
There's something dark,
something in the way,

4987
03:51:50.680 --> 03:51:53.690
and you don't know what
it is and it's frustrating.

4988
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:55.880
You shake your head and tense your eyes

4989
03:51:55.880 --> 03:51:59.200
and as you push a third
time, it pushes back.

4990
03:51:59.200 --> 03:52:02.520
All of you watch as the
clay suddenly cracks,

4991
03:52:02.520 --> 03:52:05.950
shatters across the room,
sending shards everywhere,

4992
03:52:05.950 --> 03:52:07.960
you're having to block your eyes.

4993
03:52:07.960 --> 03:52:10.490
The window blasts open a little bit.

4994
03:52:10.490 --> 03:52:12.320
The spell itself, the ritual,

4995
03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:14.950
the containment field of energy suddenly drops.

4996
03:52:15.970 --> 03:52:18.470
All you hear, between the two of you,

4997
03:52:18.470 --> 03:52:21.636
as the shadow that encases Nott,

4998
03:52:21.636 --> 03:52:24.169
is this terrible laugh.

4999
03:52:24.169 --> 03:52:28.094
(high-pitched cackling)

5000
03:52:30.790 --> 03:52:33.356
And all that you recall is the last time

5001
03:52:33.356 --> 03:52:35.173
you heard that laugh.

5002
03:52:35.173 --> 03:52:36.414
TRAVIS: That motherfucker.

5003
03:52:36.414 --> 03:52:38.878
MATT: When you were placed beneath that water.

5004
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:44.672
You've sensed this before, things like this,

5005
03:52:46.450 --> 03:52:50.320
but lying deep in the heart of Nott's form

5006
03:52:50.320 --> 03:52:53.102
lies a curse that still holds her.

5007
03:52:55.220 --> 03:53:00.220
Something that still grips her essence

5008
03:53:00.420 --> 03:53:04.137
from whatever creature laid this fate upon her.

5009
03:53:06.270 --> 03:53:07.886
And that's where we'll pick up next time.

5010
03:53:07.886 --> 03:53:10.010
(groaning)

5011
03:53:10.010 --> 03:53:14.731
TRAVIS: Holy shit!
LIAM: Oh.

5012
03:53:14.731 --> 03:53:16.150
SAM: You bastard.

5013
03:53:16.150 --> 03:53:18.366
TALIESIN: Great blue orbs of magic.

5014
03:53:18.366 --> 03:53:20.330
(laughter)

5015
03:53:20.330 --> 03:53:22.549
LAURA: Holy moly.

5016
03:53:22.549 --> 03:53:23.732
ASHLEY: (exhaling)

5017
03:53:23.732 --> 03:53:25.040
TALIESIN: Okay, okay, okay.

5018
03:53:25.040 --> 03:53:28.981
TRAVIS: (slowly) Who was dis bitch?!

5019
03:53:28.981 --> 03:53:30.433
(laughter)

5020
03:53:30.433 --> 03:53:33.208
SAM: I don't know.
TALIESIN: We're going to have to fuck some shit up.

5021
03:53:33.208 --> 03:53:35.500
LAURA: We got to go this find
this-- this here witch.

5022
03:53:35.500 --> 03:53:37.025
TALIESIN: Yep, yep.

5023
03:53:38.110 --> 03:53:40.116
SAM: Am I alive?
TRAVIS: Are you okay?

5024
03:53:40.116 --> 03:53:41.510
SAM: Where am I?
TRAVIS: Are you there?

5025
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:43.710
You're encased in black-- what?

5026
03:53:43.710 --> 03:53:46.690
MATT: To give you some context here--
SAM: We're back in, everybody.

5027
03:53:46.690 --> 03:53:49.070
MATT: For the final moment to return to, Nott--

5028
03:53:49.070 --> 03:53:51.171
Yeah, no no, for the moment, when all of you

5029
03:53:51.171 --> 03:53:52.596
look at this and realize the sound,

5030
03:53:52.596 --> 03:53:55.690
that Nott, you are safe, you are fine,
you are where you were sitting--

5031
03:53:55.690 --> 03:53:57.160
SAM: Am I alive?
MATT: You're alive,

5032
03:53:57.160 --> 03:54:00.168
but you're still in your
goblin body, unchanged.

5033
03:54:01.678 --> 03:54:02.511
So.

5034
03:54:02.511 --> 03:54:04.061
TRAVIS: Who could hear the laugh? Just Caleb?

5035
03:54:04.061 --> 03:54:06.029
MATT: Just Caleb and Nott.

5036
03:54:06.029 --> 03:54:08.643
The two that were directly
connected as part of this ritual.

5037
03:54:08.643 --> 03:54:11.628
LIAM: Alive, spell thwarted.
MATT: Correct.

5038
03:54:11.628 --> 03:54:14.920
And the components consumed
but the spell thwarted

5039
03:54:14.920 --> 03:54:19.914
by whatever-- whatever
strange curse still holds her.

5040
03:54:19.914 --> 03:54:24.010
TRAVIS: Ooh, he made you do the exercise

5041
03:54:24.010 --> 03:54:25.828
and then ripped it from ya!

5042
03:54:25.828 --> 03:54:26.820
(laughter)

5043
03:54:26.820 --> 03:54:29.054
ASHLEY: I wasn't ready to say bye to Nott.

5044
03:54:29.054 --> 03:54:30.362
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

5045
03:54:30.362 --> 03:54:32.927
LIAM: Your eyes got all red and teary, and--

5046
03:54:32.927 --> 03:54:34.020
"Fuck you."

5047
03:54:34.020 --> 03:54:36.816
(laughter)

5048
03:54:36.816 --> 03:54:38.580
TRAVIS: (whoops)

5049
03:54:38.580 --> 03:54:41.160
LAURA: Remove five-- or ten-- how much?

5050
03:54:41.160 --> 03:54:45.100
50 gold from your thing.
LIAM: Interesting, interesting.

5051
03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:47.475
MATT: So, we'll see here this goes next week.

5052
03:54:47.475 --> 03:54:48.716
LAURA: Gosh.

5053
03:54:48.716 --> 03:54:50.449
TALIESIN: (groaning)

5054
03:54:50.449 --> 03:54:52.389
LIAM: Take you down to Goblin Town.

5055
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:54.782
MATT: (chuckling)

5056
03:54:54.782 --> 03:54:57.903
LIAM: Oh, I was so curious to meet the halfling.

5057
03:54:57.903 --> 03:54:58.934
Hoo.
LAURA: I know.

5058
03:54:58.934 --> 03:55:00.583
MATT: You may still yet.

5059
03:55:00.583 --> 03:55:03.495
LIAM: We'd best kill her. We'll
just kill her next episode.

5060
03:55:03.495 --> 03:55:06.083
TRAVIS: If she's a she at all.
SAM: That's right.

5061
03:55:06.083 --> 03:55:07.640
LAURA: We don't know.
SAM: You don't know.

5062
03:55:07.640 --> 03:55:10.458
I lied about my story a hundred times before.

5063
03:55:10.458 --> 03:55:12.451
TRAVIS: You could be paying Yeza.

5064
03:55:12.451 --> 03:55:14.994
That dude's collecting checks.
SAM: That's right.

5065
03:55:14.994 --> 03:55:16.335
(laughter)

5066
03:55:16.335 --> 03:55:19.151
MATT: Completes the ritual
and Nott emerges as a

5067
03:55:19.151 --> 03:55:20.634
like, goliath.

5068
03:55:20.634 --> 03:55:21.679
(laughter)

5069
03:55:21.679 --> 03:55:23.179
TALIESIN: This die, what did you give me?

5070
03:55:23.179 --> 03:55:25.412
TRAVIS: (deep voice) I'm so happy to be back.

5071
03:55:25.412 --> 03:55:27.441
SAM: Yeza was an actor.

5072
03:55:27.441 --> 03:55:29.863
And Luc was, like, a really small actor.

5073
03:55:29.863 --> 03:55:31.122
(laughter)

5074
03:55:31.122 --> 03:55:33.072
"Hey, when do I get my 50 bucks?"

5075
03:55:33.072 --> 03:55:34.963
(loud conversations)

5076
03:55:34.963 --> 03:55:37.482
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

5077
03:55:37.482 --> 03:55:38.315
MATT: Anyway.

5078
03:55:38.315 --> 03:55:39.615
LIAM: We like Andy.

5079
03:55:39.615 --> 03:55:40.448
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Holy fuck!

5080
03:55:40.448 --> 03:55:42.578
MATT: We'll pick that up next week.

5081
03:55:42.578 --> 03:55:44.160
Thank you guys for joining us.

5082
03:55:44.160 --> 03:55:46.300
Please don't forget, we love you very much

5083
03:55:46.300 --> 03:55:48.310
and, is it Thursday yet?

5084
03:55:48.310 --> 03:55:49.468
Good night.

5085
03:55:49.468 --> 03:55:50.528
(cast groaning)

5086
03:55:50.528 --> 03:55:53.261
(dramatic music)

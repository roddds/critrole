00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.100
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.160
of Critical Role, where a bunch

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.380
of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

4
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.890
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.172
TRAVIS: We play Dungeon &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:09.405
TALIESIN: Ahooga!

7
00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.243
MATT: Don't-- never.

8
00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:14.243
Never ready.

9
00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:16.040
TALIESIN: I didn't know if it was going to work.

10
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.540
I didn't know if it was going to work.

11
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.440
MATT: Congratulations, you guys are punking yourselves now.

12
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.408
I love this.

13
00:00:23.408 --> 00:00:24.680
So welcome! Before we get into tonight's game,

14
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.610
we have some quick announcements to get through, starting,

15
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.530
first and foremost-- we have two fantastic sponsors tonight.

16
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.820
Our first sponsor, our friends for the entirety

17
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.250
of Campaign Two, D&amp;D Beyond.

18
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.020
TRAVIS: D&amp;D Beyond!

19
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.090
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond. Hey, guys, D&amp;D--

20
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.120
there's-- all new bundles have been added to D&amp;D Beyond.

The Source Book Bundle gives you all published source books.

That's the Player's Handbook, the DMG,

23

Xanathar's Guide, and more, plus

24

The Adventure Bundle gives you all published adventures.

we all know Waterdeep, we all know Dragon Heist,

there are others, and 10% off all future adventures,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.120
ideal for the intrepid DM who wants access

31
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.980
to the many worlds of D&amp;D.

32
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.820
Check them out now at bit.ly/BeyondBundles,

33
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.430
I'm sure that URL will show up.

34
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.050
But guys, what I wanted to talk to you about tonight--

35
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.883
turn off your phones.

36
00:01:24.883 --> 00:01:26.183
(laughter)

37
00:01:26.183 --> 00:01:29.350
SAM: I don't know about you, but I have been real bad

38
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.170
about keeping up my voiceover career,

39
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.610
because we've been so, we've been so busy, right?

40
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.550
Doing Kickstarter stuff.

41
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.383
Yeah.

42
00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:39.290
TALIESIN: Are we acknowledging that right now?

43
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.123
LAURA: Yeah.

44
00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:41.315
SAM: So my

45
00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:42.148
agent called, and was like,

46
00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:43.800
"You haven't done an audition in weeks,"

47
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.790
and I was like, when do I have time?

48
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.750
And then it hit me, I have

49
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.541
between two and four minutes...

50
00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:52.257
(laughter)

51
00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:54.400
SAM: ...right here, every Thursday night,

52
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.010
that I could do anything with,

53
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.591
so I'm going to do some voiceover auditions.

54
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:00.920
If you guys don't mind--

55
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.630
it's really good sound quality in here.

56
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.810
We have a good sound guy.

57
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.550
TALIESIN: I'm sure this doesn't break any--

58
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.060
SAM: I'm just going to knock them off.

59
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.780
I'm going to substitute D&amp;D Beyond into the ads,

60
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.680
so that, you know, I'll edit it out later,

61
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.940
but at least it feels like it's still an ad for the sponsor.

62
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.350
Travis, you're in one of these, too.

63
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.310
TRAVIS: I am?

64
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.100
SAM: Get it in your email, but for now,

65
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.840
I've got three spots to read,

66
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.480
and I'll just read them real quick. Quiet, please,

67
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.920
because I'm going to use this audio later. Okay.

68
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.860
Hi, this is Sam Riegel.

69
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.460
New in the Super Value Menu, it's D&amp;D Beyond!

70
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.410
Two mouth-watering pure beef patties,

71
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.910
homemade buns, crispy lettuce, juicy tomato,

72
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.720
and enough special sauce to make you say,

73
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.050
Dang! One more D&amp;D Beyond for the road.

74
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.910
Flame-grilled (stutters) D&amp;D Beyond, fuck, pickup.

75
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.940
Flame-grilled D&amp;D Beyond, now on the Super Value Menu

76
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.607
for a limited time. Okay, that's one spot.

77
00:02:52.607 --> 00:02:55.190
I'll edit out the hiccup later.

78
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.220
Travis?
TRAVIS: Uh-huh?

79
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.970
SAM: Okay, yeah, so sometimes when you do auditions,

80
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.690
you do a partner read, yeah, and sometimes--

81
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.694
LAURA: But he's not even next to the mic.

82
00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:05.700
TRAVIS: I'll edit him out later. It's just for me.

83
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.760
I don't care about him, but anyway--

84
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.840
so this'll be a read that you do

85
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.700
with a partner to audition for the role. Anyway.

86
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.650
TRAVIS: You ready?

87
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.780
SAM: You start.

88
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.540
TRAVIS: Whoa, how'd you get to the campsite so fast?

89
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.980
SAM: Easy, I drove here in my 2019 D&amp;D Beyond XLS.

90
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.730
TRAVIS: Sweet ride.

91
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.070
SAM: With true four-wheel drive,

92
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.650
stable tech steering, and a fuel-injected V8,

93
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.490
D&amp;D Beyond gets me anywhere I want to go.

94
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.590
TRAVIS: My truck won't even start in these conditions.

95
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.115
It's so weak and puny,

96
00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:36.140
just like me, (resigned) Travis Willingham.

97
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.940
SAM: Well, do something about it,

98
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.473
lease a 2019 D&amp;D Beyond

99
00:03:39.473 --> 00:03:42.710
and you'll feel as strong and masculine as me, Sam Riegel.

100
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.670
Plus it's got bass lift 7.1 digital stereo system.

101
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.950
On-road or off, the D&amp;D Beyond gets you there in style.

102
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.410
TRAVIS: (through his teeth) Mind if I take it for a spin?

103
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.930
SAM: No way, baby bro! Get your own D&amp;D Beyond.

104
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.387
TRAVIS: Oh, motherfucker. (laughs)

105
00:03:57.387 --> 00:03:59.095
SAM: Okay, okay, some edits there,

106
00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:00.053
but I'll work on it later.

107
00:04:00.053 --> 00:04:01.200
ASHLEY: That was such a cool voice.

108
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.230
SAM: Thank you. You know, as a voice artist,

109
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.490
you want to change your voice to suit the material,

110
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.273
so I think you'll hear that on this next spot.

111
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.600
Okay, this next spot's a little more serious, so.

112
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.750
Hi, this is Sam Riegel,

113
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.310
when I found out I had genital herpes,

114
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.610
I didn't know what to do. I was ashamed, embarrassed,

115
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.830
and I couldn't stop itching my groin.

116
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.234
But my doctor told me about D&amp;D Beyond.

117
00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:27.375
MATT: Oh no.

118
00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:30.070
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond suppresses any mild to moderate case

119
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.640
of genital herpes, and is proven to reduce the sores,

120
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.540
watery blisters, and burning sensation associated

121
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.970
with the virus. Talk to your doctor about D&amp;D Beyond.

122
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.180
D&amp;D Beyond is an over-the-counter,

123
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.630
subscription-based app. If you experience numbness

124
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.080
in your buttocks, or painful urination,

125
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.740
stop using D&amp;D Beyond and consult your doctor.

126
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.950
Say goodbye to genital herpes at D&amp;D Beyond.com.

127
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.760
LAURA: Wow.

128
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.180
SAM: Okay, thanks guys.

129
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.622
I did some good auditions tonight.

130
00:04:59.622 --> 00:05:04.390
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's legally... okay.

131
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.310
SAM: I did some good VO work tonight, guys,

132
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.371
and I think the sponsor's going to love it.

133
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:11.427
(laughter)

134
00:05:11.427 --> 00:05:12.320
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

135
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.153
SAM: Sure!

136
00:05:13.153 --> 00:05:16.075
MATT: We're so sorry. We're so sorry.

137
00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:17.510
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

138
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.710
MATT: Our second sponsor--

139
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.151
(laughter)

140
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:24.760
MATT: -- that Sam is not announcing, our fantastic friends

141
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.970
at Eldritch Foundry. If you guys haven't seen yet,

142
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.540
the Kickstarter is up. They are massive Critters

143
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.410
in their own right, and they are now revealing--

144
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.060
they are now makers of a fully-customizable,

145
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.950
3D-printed miniature

146
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.540
program system, the whole thing.

147
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.690
I don't know what the official title would be,

148
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.200
but it's awesome.

149
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.590
So they have a really cool character creator app

150
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.120
that you can check out that allows you

151
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.590
to create your actual characters

152
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.370
and customize the minis before ordering them.

153
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.470
All the different pieces have actual lore embedded

154
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.860
to help inspire as you're designing a character,

155
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.570
which is pretty rad.

156
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.730
They're working hand-in-hand with actual local game stores

157
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.360
to ensure that every part of the community benefits

158
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.100
from this awesome program they're developing.

159
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.410
But the Kickstarter is live, as of today,

160
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.590
so if you get a chance, check it out.

161
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.610
There's an early bird special you can jump in for,

162
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.440
with a discount, as well as exclusive marker bases

163
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.890
available for them, as well.

164
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.800
To support them, go check out Critrole.com/EldritchFoundry.

165
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.460
That's E-L-D-R-I-T-C-H Foundry.

166
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.468
TRAVIS: (southern accent) Eldritch Foundry.

167
00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:24.643
(laughter)

168
00:06:24.643 --> 00:06:26.240
MATT: Why didn't you read this? Dammit!

169
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.650
TRAVIS: (laughs)

170
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.220
MATT: Thank you so much. All right, quick reminder,

171
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.500
we-- many of our shows, including Talks Machina

172
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.190
and Critical Role you're watching here, are available

173
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.710
in podcast form on iTunes, Google,

174
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.390
and Spotify, as well as other places

175
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.360
where fine podcasts can be found.

176
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.130
Look for the black Critical Role logo

177
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.060
after searching for them in your favorite app,

178
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.600
and check out Critrole.com/FAQ for links

179
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.980
and details about them. We've had some questions

180
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.910
about the podcasts and where they go,

181
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.450
so just making sure some folks know about that.

182
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.070
Remind your friends if they're confused.

183
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.988
We have a merch update from you, Laura, I believe.

184
00:06:57.988 --> 00:06:59.730
SAM: Laura Bailey.

185
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.160
This is an exciting one, guys.

186
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.750
LAURA: This is an exciting one. So you may have noticed

187
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.942
in the store this morning! We released some,

188
00:07:06.942 --> 00:07:09.900
you know, shirts that people have been asking

189
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.180
for for quite a while, and it's our Vox Machina

190
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.160
original first season.

191
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.797
We've got our Grog Strongjaw!

192
00:07:18.797 --> 00:07:20.105
MATT: Yeah!

193
00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:24.029
LAURA: Strongjaw Ale and our Dagger, Dagger, Dagger.

194
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:26.712
(cheering)

195
00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:27.937
SAM: It was stealthing!

196
00:07:27.937 --> 00:07:30.570
LAURA: Those are designed by OG Critter, Kennef Riggles,

197
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.403
so thank you.

198
00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:32.250
MATT: Hell yeah, Kennef.

199
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.420
LAURA: Thank you so much.

200
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.670
And in addition to that, we also have-- oh!

201
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.778
TRAVIS: (gasps)

202
00:07:39.778 --> 00:07:42.297
LAURA: This beautiful pin. You may have noticed Marisha

203
00:07:42.297 --> 00:07:46.540
wearing it on Talks Machina. Sneaky sneak.

204
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.840
Yeah, so these are in the store now, too.

205
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.060
Designed by Lauryn Ipsum. So cool, I know.

206
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.060
We have them in the store, and we have,

207
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.300
I think, some here at the studios,

208
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.700
so we're all going to be taking some home with us.

209
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.383
ASHLEY: I'll put the pin on my jean jacket.

210
00:07:59.383 --> 00:08:01.033
LAURA: Heck yes!

211
00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:03.150
TALIESIN: Metal AF, metal AF.

212
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.940
LAURA: So yeah, the shirts are in the US.

213
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.080
The pins are in US and UK store,

214
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.130
and then the shirts are just in the US store for now,

215
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.689
but they will be coming to the UK store, so.

216
00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:15.131
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Laura.

217
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:16.739
ASHLEY: I love it.

218
00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:18.340
I love this pin.

219
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.200
MATT: Yeah, it's a great pin, and final announcement

220
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.340
for the evening. As of midnight tonight,

221
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.220
we'll be turning over to May 10th,

222
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.888
which is the birthday of our fabulous Marisha Ray.

223
00:08:26.888 --> 00:08:30.227
(cheering)

224
00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:31.243
MARISHA: You know I hate this shit.

225
00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:32.076
MATT: I know you do!

226
00:08:32.076 --> 00:08:33.434
LIAM: It could happen in game,

227
00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:35.242
if we putter around long enough.

228
00:08:35.242 --> 00:08:36.134
MATT: Please don't.

229
00:08:36.134 --> 00:08:37.430
TRAVIS: What's wrong with your face?

230
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.847
MARISHA: Bad guy.

231
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.150
MATT: As we get to invite her into her majestic 30s, so.

232
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.128
Happy to have you, happy birthday.

233
00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:49.970
I love you.

234
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.850
All right, guys.

235
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.010
She's so embarrassed!

236
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.420
Look at her getting all warm and red.

237
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.253
TALIESIN: It's time to settle down,

238
00:08:55.253 --> 00:08:56.620
and start thinking about what you want to do,

239
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.309
and really, you know, get a proper job or something.

240
00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:00.497
MARISHA: You're not wrong.

241
00:09:01.347 --> 00:09:03.630
My parents will be stoked, take my life seriously.

242
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.463
TALIESIN: Yeah.

243
00:09:04.463 --> 00:09:06.810
TRAVIS: Nobody plays imagination their whole life.

244
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.010
You've got to be a real person.

245
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.294
LAURA: A real person.

246
00:09:10.294 --> 00:09:12.740
MARISHA: Twitch dot what?

247
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.393
MATT: So happy birthday.

248
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.300
All right.

249
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.530
I believe that's the end of our announcements,

250
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.490
so let's go ahead and bring ourselves

251
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.465
into tonight's episode of

252
00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:24.390

289
00:11:07.698 --> 00:11:08.531
last we left off.

290
00:11:08.531 --> 00:11:09.764
LIAM: Turducken!

291
00:11:09.764 --> 00:11:13.699

294
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.350
MATT: Last we left off, the Mighty Nein,

295
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.750
upon returning from your journey towards the Penumbra Range,

296
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.530
helping to free a group of surviving stone giants

297
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.400
from a demonic incursion in their cavern,

298
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.320
and in doing so, also helping free one of the local mines

299
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.406
and steelworks on the Kryn Dynasty

300
00:11:37.406 --> 00:11:39.500
from the scourge of these giants,

301
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.230
you return to the city of Rosohna.

302
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.970
You retrieved your reward for this venture,

303
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.210
and towards the end of taking some time

304
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.730
to scout out some of the locations within the city,

305
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.360
were greeted by Essek and presented,

306
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.810
as the other half of your gift of helping the Dynasty

307
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.810
with the retrieval and return of one of the Beacons, a home.

308
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.650
So with this abode loosely furnished,

309
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.960
but open to

310
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.600
whatever customization features you're able to look into,

311
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.460
interested in, and can afford, it is

312
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.380
your house to make of it as you wish.

313
00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.330
So, Mighty Nein, as you step into the cold interior

314
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.450
of your new home,

315
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.940
dark,

316
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.800
dusty, but yours.

317
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.860
What would you like to do?

318
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.385
TALIESIN: Spending all the money on booze,

319
00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:32.543
and we're going to have

320
00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:35.084
just a rager party for a week, trash the place,

321
00:12:35.084 --> 00:12:36.900
top to bottom.

322
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.380
TRAVIS: Trainspotting style.

323
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.284
MARISHA: Yeah. If you leave out a tip jar,

324
00:12:40.284 --> 00:12:43.100
you can make your money back, and then, sometimes.

325
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.640
LAURA: I look at Beau and go, let's claim our room,

326
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.860
and I go running up the stairs

327
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.263
to find the room that we want.

328
00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:49.475
MARISHA: And I chase after her.

329
00:12:49.475 --> 00:12:50.925
TALIESIN: I go walking up the stairs.

330
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.370
MARISHA: I throw open all the doors, and I'm looking at all

331
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.780
of them, and I'm comparing each one,

332
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.220
because there is definitely a better one.

333
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.053
LAURA: Yeah.

334
00:12:58.053 --> 00:12:59.650
MARISHA: Or a best one.

335
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.483
LAURA: Yeah.

336
00:13:00.483 --> 00:13:01.490
SAM: Roll for investigation.

337
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.610
MATT: Yeah, you guys have your own aesthetics here,

338
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.430
and you get to decide amongst yourselves who stays where.

339
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.420
This is for you to decide, not me. (laughs)

340
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.020
LAURA: This is-- can I write on this?

341
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.661
MATT: You may, it is yours.

342
00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:16.682
(laughter)

343
00:13:16.682 --> 00:13:17.515
I can always print more.

344
00:13:17.515 --> 00:13:20.190
TALIESIN: Matt, Laura's in my room, Laura's in my room,

345
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.190
that's my-- Matt, Laura's in my room.

346
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.190
MATT: Both of you roll wisdom saving throws.

347
00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.508
TALIESIN: Eye contact, eye--

348
00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.640
LAURA: I rolled so good.

349
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.390
TALIESIN: Fuck, I rolled terrible.
(laughter)

350
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.750
You get whatever room you want.

351
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.742
MATT: Yeah, sorry.
TALIESIN: (sullenly) I don't care.

352
00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:38.775
(laughter)

353
00:13:38.775 --> 00:13:40.500
LIAM: They're gone, but before we take apart

354
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.760
this entire house,

355
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.910
who is sleeping-- I guess they're bunking up.

356
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.830
SAM: Jester and?

357
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.663
LAURA: And Beau.

358
00:13:47.663 --> 00:13:48.930
TRAVIS: Well, I need a roommate.

359
00:13:51.076 --> 00:13:52.910
TALIESIN: Are we bunk-- wait, what?

360
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.540
LAURA: I guess everybody doesn't need--

361
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.020
there are enough rooms here

362
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.025
that people don't have to bunk up.

363
00:13:58.025 --> 00:13:59.183
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

364
00:13:59.183 --> 00:14:00.333
ASHLEY: How many bedrooms are there?

365
00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:03.390
LAURA: One, two, three, four, five, technically six,

366
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.130
if you want to take that.
TALIESIN: I may take that.

367
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.547
LAURA: And then there's one downstairs, that's seven.

368
00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:12.408
TALIESIN: I mean, you can do a lot with--

369
00:14:12.408 --> 00:14:13.910
SAM: Do we want a spare room for guests?

370
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.623
LAURA: Yeah, they can take the downstairs one.

371
00:14:15.623 --> 00:14:16.590
SAM: Okay.

372
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.270
TRAVIS: Wait, we're going to have guests over?

373
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.103
LAURA: We could.

374
00:14:19.103 --> 00:14:20.590
LIAM: You're taking this one, the two of you?

375
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.020
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

376
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.770
TALIESIN: I have a quick point of contention.

377
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.740
Are we planning to put down a little bit

378
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.600
of roots here, is this the plan?

379
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.020
Because I'm not saying we're necessarily going to stay here,

380
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.703
but is this--

381
00:14:35.703 --> 00:14:38.600
are we deciding that this is just going to be--

382
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.790
are we going to be leaving things here?

383
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.390
TRAVIS: Well, no, right?

384
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.223
TALIESIN: Well, I mean,

385
00:14:43.223 --> 00:14:45.022
this is a good question to put forward,

386
00:14:45.022 --> 00:14:47.800
and I'm fine either way, but--

387
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.610
SAM: It's a base of operations, where you could come

388
00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.080
and go as we please, obviously,

389
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.457
but we're not going to stay here forever.

390
00:14:56.457 --> 00:14:57.573
TALIESIN: Go ahead.

391
00:14:57.573 --> 00:14:59.810
LIAM: We have this together, even if we leave,

392
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.060
I think we still have it, so property is property.

393
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.743
TALIESIN: It might be useful just to have a place

394
00:15:05.743 --> 00:15:10.050
to come back to, to circle round if things go awry.

395
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:12.020
LAURA: I've never had a house before that wasn't,

396
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.822
you know, also like a club.

397
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.260
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've lived in some odd places,

398
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.951
well, one odd place, one place in my life.

399
00:15:19.951 --> 00:15:22.001
TRAVIS: We can <i>mm-chicka-mm-chicka through the night</i>

400
00:15:22.001 --> 00:15:23.250
'till you feel comfortable.

401
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.050
LIAM: Have you ever lived under a roof?

402
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.630
ASHLEY: Not like this, no, just things

403
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.060
that we've sort of built out of, I don't know,

404
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.940
stuff of the earth, but I've never lived

405
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.810
in a home like this before.

406
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.710
SAM: Do you want to sleep on the balcony?

407
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.710
ASHLEY: Well, if there is a room that's close

408
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.830
to the balcony, I wouldn't mind if sometimes I--

409
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.840
I feel a little weird, or a little squirrely,

410
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.650
that I could go outside, and sleep.

411
00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.930
LAURA: You can be next to us, Yasha, if you want to.

412
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.150
SAM: That little room right there.

413
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.327
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll--
LAURA: Or this one.

414
00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:55.585
ASHLEY: I'll take that one in the middle,

415
00:15:55.585 --> 00:15:56.768
if that's not already taken.

416
00:15:56.768 --> 00:15:58.550
LAURA: I'm going to write Yasha on here.

417
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.874
ASHLEY: Okay.

418
00:15:59.874 --> 00:16:02.050
TRAVIS: While we were walking up, how secure is this thing?

419
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.130
Is it made of wood, stone, are there windows

420
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.430
that you can get to off the ground floor?

421
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.550
MATT: Both, actually. The foundation itself is stone,

422
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.900
and it looks like some of the

423
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.430
load bearing portions of the building are stone,

424
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.707
and then there is a painted

425
00:16:20.042 --> 00:16:21.983
Vermaloc wood around those for

426
00:16:21.983 --> 00:16:24.720
decoration and additional support, so it's both.

427
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.590
TRAVIS: Okay, and windows galore?

428
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.701
MATT: There are a number of windows, yes.

429
00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:29.542
TALIESIN: That hardly matters.

430
00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:31.560
It's dark out all day, anyway.

431
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.270
SAM: And Caleb, will you be upstairs or downstairs?

432
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.690
LIAM: I don't-- I don't know-- you're with Yeza.

433
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.482
SAM: Yes, of course, I'll be with Yeza, but

434
00:16:41.482 --> 00:16:43.870
we could take the room next to Yasha.

435
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.930
TALIESIN: I think there's a library, too. Oh.

436
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.620
LAURA: Well, this one has access to a whole other bedroom.

437
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.220
Whoever's staying in this far one, they have

438
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.620
to cross through someone else's room to get here.

439
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.970
LIAM: Oh, this could be a common room,

440
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.693
or used for some other purpose,

441
00:16:56.693 --> 00:16:57.980
beside the bedroom.
LAURA: It's true.

442
00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.470
And then make a bedroom off of that?

443
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.550
LIAM: Yes, correct.

444
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.820
LAURA: Okay, so let's-- I took this bed, anyway,

445
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.493
so let's take this bed, and move it in here.

446
00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:07.957
MARISHA: I help drag beds.

447
00:17:07.957 --> 00:17:09.863
LAURA: This is a happy room.

448
00:17:10.745 --> 00:17:11.890
SAM: A happy room?

449
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.248
LAURA: Yeah, where you go, and you hang out,

450
00:17:13.248 --> 00:17:15.414
and you be happy.

451
00:17:15.414 --> 00:17:16.850
LIAM: This is a bedroom.

452
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.465
SAM: I've never had a happy room.

453
00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:20.550
LAURA: Now you do.

454
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.580
TALIESIN: Are you happy before you go in,

455
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.870
you have to be happy, or is it the room

456
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.170
that you get happy in?

457
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.290
SAM: Who's in the bedroom at the end, the corner suite?

458
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:28.610
TALIESIN: Somebody's really happy.

459
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.923
LAURA: One person gets a corner room that's next

460
00:17:30.923 --> 00:17:33.360
to the happy room, one person gets-- this is you and Yeza.

461
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.476
SAM: Yeza, yes, for--

462
00:17:34.476 --> 00:17:36.842
LAURA: I'm going to go in and push your beds together,

463
00:17:36.842 --> 00:17:39.724
so you can have a nice, comfy room together.

464
00:17:39.724 --> 00:17:42.479
(laughter)

465
00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:44.600
SAM: I don't like that mattress in the middle, the split.

466
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.364
TRAVIS: Yeah, it never works out.
SAM: No, it doesn't.

467
00:17:46.364 --> 00:17:49.005
LAURA: Should I write "Veth" or "Nott" on the map?

468
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.470
Probably "Yeza and Veth," huh?

469
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.803
LIAM: Jester, could you maybe paint the beds together?

470
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.190
LAURA: I don't need to, because-- I mean, I could.

471
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.863
SAM: I don't like the little seam.

472
00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:03.630
Could you just paint out the seam?

473
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.920
LAURA: Well, remember when we tried to do that before,

474
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.430
and I made a plank of wood,

475
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.280
but it was just a loose plank of wood?

476
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.180
I'm afraid if I do that, it'll just be a stripe.

477
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.230
SAM: A waste of paint.

478
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.540
LAURA: Yeah, of fabric or something.

479
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.750
So you're over here, then.

480
00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.610
Or do you want to be downstairs?

481
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.341
What about Fjord?

482
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:25.191
Who's downstairs, and who's in the corner? Fjord?

483
00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:27.300
MARISHA: Who's next to us?

484
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.140
LAURA: Whoever is next to us,

485
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.560
I definitely won't spy on them ever.

486
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.270
LIAM: There is a-- this is a common room,

487
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.490
or this could be a study, or a laboratory.

488
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.810
SAM: And then you could be next to it.

489
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.800
LAURA: So you want this corner one downstairs,

490
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.405
under Nott, okay.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

491
00:18:47.718 --> 00:18:50.290
TRAVIS: If y'all need a strapping protector of courage

492
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.607
and bravery of untold proportions,

493
00:18:52.607 --> 00:18:53.900
I don't mind sleeping next to y'all.

494
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.180
MARISHA: You know, if you sleep, and we share a wall,

495
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.990
we can learn morse code, and we can just tap

496
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.635
to each other throughout the wall.

497
00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:02.940
LAURA: (gasps)

498
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.050
Or, you know what else we could do?

499
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.780
I could paint a hole in the wall,

500
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.840
and then we can talk to each other through the hole.

501
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.470
SAM: Just a big hole in the wall?

502
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.293
LAURA: Like, a little one, we could--

503
00:19:15.293 --> 00:19:16.676
TRAVIS: Is there already a hole in the wall?

504
00:19:16.676 --> 00:19:18.153
LAURA: No, but I could make one.

505
00:19:18.153 --> 00:19:20.052
TRAVIS: I don't think we want to deface the house

506
00:19:20.052 --> 00:19:21.473
that's a gift, right?

507
00:19:21.473 --> 00:19:23.700
SAM: But if we wanted to add to it, we could.

508
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.090
LAURA: Yeah, I could add a hole in the wall.

509
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.940
LIAM: Caduceus, what are you going to do?

510
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.067
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to put down roots.

511
00:19:32.944 --> 00:19:36.004
SAM: And so you're going to be in the tower, outside, right?

512
00:19:36.004 --> 00:19:37.510
TALIESIN: Yeah, I got an idea.

513
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.620
ASHLEY: Okay, is there a place for

514
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.280
training or anything like that?

515
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.210
LAURA: Yeah, let's turn this room that was a bedroom

516
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.562
into a training room.

517
00:19:46.562 --> 00:19:49.424
SAM: This is so visually compelling for our audience.

518
00:19:49.424 --> 00:19:51.495
(laughter)

519
00:19:51.495 --> 00:19:53.513
TALIESIN: And now interpretive dance.

520
00:19:53.513 --> 00:19:55.299
LIAM: It's our game, we're playing for us.

521
00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:56.140
MATT: Welcome to D&amp;D.

522
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.250
LAURA: Can you see?

523
00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.600
LIAM: Yeah, we'll post a picture.

524
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.103
MARISHA: Yeah, it's, you, Jester, Yasha, Fjord,

525
00:20:02.103 --> 00:20:05.053
yeah, Beau, you get it.

526
00:20:07.174 --> 00:20:08.298
SAM: You get it.

527
00:20:08.298 --> 00:20:09.423
MATT: It's fine.

528
00:20:09.423 --> 00:20:10.777
SAM: And the rest.

529
00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:13.400
LIAM: Jester, this is where you're building a training room?

530
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.280
LAURA: Training room.
LIAM: Okay, so I'm going

531
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.020
to mark this as a library and laboratory.

532
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.480
LAURA: Libra-- it's already a library, so--

533
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.540
LIAM: Yeah, but we are going to add a lab for Veth.

534
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.388
LAURA: Okay, plus lab.
LIAM: Yeah.

535
00:20:25.388 --> 00:20:26.650
LAURA: You got it.

536
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.180
SAM: Same room?

537
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.013
LIAM: Yeah.

538
00:20:29.013 --> 00:20:30.340
SAM: Library and lab?

539
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.100
LIAM: Well, different ends-- I don't-- we don't have

540
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.560
a vast library, I just mean a study.

541
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.430
SAM: I know, but if there's a fire or something,

542
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.700
I'm just saying.
LIAM: I can handle that.

543
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.150
LAURA: Hey, I think there's a bloodstain in the basement,

544
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.830
you guys.
TRAVIS: Really?

545
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.170
TALIESIN: I think someone was just eating something

546
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.770
with ketchup when they were holding the map.

547
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.780
LAURA: Oh, okay.
TALIESIN: Oh, wow, no--

548
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.870
LAURA: No, I think there's blood,

549
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.520
can we investigate the basement for blood?

550
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.940
MATT: Sure, you go and investigate the basement.

551
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.380
It is empty, make an investigation check.

552
00:20:58.677 --> 00:20:59.977
TALIESIN: Hey!

553
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.790
LAURA: I am into these dice, 20.

554
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:08.790
MATT: 20, nice. Inspecting the corners of it, you find

555
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:13.110
rat droppings. You find leftover bits of chewed wood.

556
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.870
There is a stain. The stain appears to have been left

557
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.990
by some sort of a ruptured wine cask long ago.

558
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.510
Other than that, the room is empty.

559
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.090
LAURA: It was wine.

560
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.730
SAM: That's harmless.

561
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.590
LAURA: Hey, Beau, you're okay with Nugget being

562
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.490
in our room, right?

563
00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:33.931
MARISHA: Do I have a choice?

564
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.243
LAURA: Yes?

565
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.350
Of course, you know, we have patio access,

566
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.050
maybe I can just, you know, I can--

567
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.171
MARISHA: Yeah, as long as it doesn't get in my bed.

568
00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:46.346
He drools a lot, you know?

569
00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:47.521
LAURA: He won't, he--

570
00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:48.779
TRAVIS: You got a patio?

571
00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:50.337
ASHLEY: He could be in our little outdoor area.

572
00:21:50.337 --> 00:21:52.057
LAURA: Yeah, you don't have one, though.

573
00:21:52.057 --> 00:21:52.890
SAM: He could.

574
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.430
LAURA: He could be our guard Nugget.

575
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.730
LIAM: I have a question.

576
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.563
MATT: Yes?

577
00:21:56.563 --> 00:21:59.063
LIAM: What is this circle here?

578
00:21:59.063 --> 00:22:00.600
MATT: The circle is just a design in the floor.

579
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.810
LIAM: Okay, thank you.

580
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.660
MARISHA: I do want to do a big once over on the house,

581
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.010
and start checking it, and see if I can find any signs

582
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.230
of it being bugged.

583
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.011
MATT: Okay.

584
00:22:11.011 --> 00:22:13.010
TALIESIN: I want to check for vibes.

585
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.830
MATT: For vibes?
TALIESIN: Vibes.

586
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.350
SAM: Is that a Detect Vibes?

587
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.440
TALIESIN: Detect vibes, I want to Lebowski this place.

588
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.318
TRAVIS: Can you walk into a room and know

589
00:22:20.318 --> 00:22:21.959
where people have had sex?

590
00:22:21.959 --> 00:22:23.730
MARISHA: I rolled a natural one, so.

591
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.180
LAURA: But I was looking, too.

592
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.605
MARISHA: But Jester was looking, too.

593
00:22:27.605 --> 00:22:28.692
SAM: Question mark?

594
00:22:28.692 --> 00:22:30.602
LAURA: I'm just not as good at it.

595
00:22:30.602 --> 00:22:32.820
I thought I said I was, did I not say I was?

596
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.761
MATT: Sure, I'll allow it.

597
00:22:35.761 --> 00:22:37.420
Roll an investigation check.

598
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.680
TRAVIS: Do it. Roll. When the DM changes his mind.

599
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.870
TALIESIN: Hey.
SAM: Not great, not great.

600
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.390
LAURA: 11.

601
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.930
MATT: You guys spend the better part of a couple

602
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.710
of hours casing the place, checking the walls,

603
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.890
checking areas, not quite sure what you're looking for,

604
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.710
but for any signs of

605
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.473
tampering.

606
00:22:55.473 --> 00:22:58.020
LIAM: I would trail along with Detect Magic as well.

607
00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.850
MATT: Okay, and what were you doing, Caduceus?

608
00:23:00.924 --> 00:23:03.000
TALIESIN: I'm just checking the place out,

609
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.190
just doing a walkthrough, getting a sense of it.

610
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.023
MATT: Okay.

611
00:23:08.464 --> 00:23:09.670
TALIESIN: Just trying to see if I feel like

612
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.620
this place has good vibes or bad vibes.

613
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.720
MATT: Okay, roll a general wisdom check.

614
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.370
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

615
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.360
18.

616
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.120
MATT: 18?

617
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.190
I mean, the place is

618
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.085
fairly neutral vibes. It's a house.

619
00:23:28.085 --> 00:23:32.040
You don't sense any evil presence. You don't sense

620
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.990
a case somewhere that's exuding--

621
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.950
TALIESIN: Although you did--
MATT: Terrible energy.

622
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.860
TALIESIN: You did just inspire something in me.

623
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.190
I might also to walk around with the Detect Magic up,

624
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.560
just to see if it pings anything.

625
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.393
MATT: All right, so the two of you

626
00:23:44.393 --> 00:23:47.030
are doing a Detect Magic pass, each of you.

627
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:47.863
TALIESIN: Just looking around.

628
00:23:47.863 --> 00:23:50.630
MATT: Okay, as you both scan through the house,

629
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.380
feeling pretty confident in your ability to

630
00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.430
locate or sense anything that gives off any sort

631
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.821
of magical aura, but come up short.

632
00:23:59.821 --> 00:24:01.325
TALIESIN: All right.

633
00:24:01.325 --> 00:24:02.900
It's cool.

634
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.910
SAM: And is the kitchen all stocked with anything,

635
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.060
or do we need to stock it?

636
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.393
MATT: No, you need to stock everything.

637
00:24:09.393 --> 00:24:10.976
The house has been cleaned out, other than

638
00:24:10.976 --> 00:24:14.420
the base furniture there. There's some bookshelves,

639
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.680
but there's no books. There are

640
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.150
some tables, some chairs, some beds, very basic.

641
00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.330
And that's about it, so you're going to have to furnish it.

642
00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.043
I'm sorry.

643
00:24:27.043 --> 00:24:28.450
TRAVIS: What about secret entrances, like,

644
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.440
if we pull up the rugs and look for trapdoors--

645
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.723
TALIESIN: I don't think there are rugs.

646
00:24:31.723 --> 00:24:32.920
TRAVIS: Did you push the clocks out of the way?

647
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.713
TALIESIN: There's no clocks.

648
00:24:34.713 --> 00:24:35.840
TRAVIS: Are you <i>sure</i>?

649
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.223
TALIESIN: They've been pre-pushed

650
00:24:38.223 --> 00:24:39.793
all the way out of the way,

651
00:24:39.793 --> 00:24:42.180
out of the house.

652
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.160
SAM: Then there's some sort of storage shed.

653
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:44.993
LAURA: That's the basement.

654
00:24:44.993 --> 00:24:46.250
SAM: Oh, that's the basement, okay.

655
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.591
LAURA: You access it from the kitchen.

656
00:24:47.591 --> 00:24:49.087
SAM: Okay.

657
00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:50.090
TALIESIN: I guess it's a root cellar.

658
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.060
LIAM: We have dining room area, this is training.

659
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.780
This is the study and the laboratory.

660
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.480
There is another room up here, which is yet

661
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.710
to be chosen what it is, and the same floor,

662
00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.640
this one, and this one.

663
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.802
SAM: No, that's my room.
LIAM: No, this is your room.

664
00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:03.644
SAM: Oh.

665
00:25:03.644 --> 00:25:04.600
LAURA: This is the happy room.
SAM: Oh, you're right.

666
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.943
That's the happy room.
LIAM: What is the happy room for?

667
00:25:05.943 --> 00:25:07.452
SAM: That's the happy room; it's for being happy.

668
00:25:07.452 --> 00:25:10.107
TRAVIS: It's beanbags and stuffed animals and stuff.

669
00:25:10.107 --> 00:25:12.048
LIAM: Like a living space.
LAURA: Yeah.

670
00:25:12.048 --> 00:25:13.470
MARISHA: Lots of lava lamps.

671
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.827
TRAVIS: Pinball machines.
MARISHA: Yeah, hookah.

672
00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:16.693
LIAM: MAME cabinet.

673
00:25:16.693 --> 00:25:17.700
LAURA: But that will be right next to you,

674
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.059
and you'll be far away from me.

675
00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:21.440
MARISHA: It's got a pit built into the floor.

676
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.917
ASHLEY: Maybe entering into the library, we can,

677
00:25:25.917 --> 00:25:29.039
we can put a bookcase, and that's the entrance,

678
00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:31.970
because I've heard of these types of things before.

679
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.010
LAURA: Like a secret entrance?
ASHLEY: Yeah, like a secret entrance

680
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.360
LAURA: So nobody would even know.

681
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.830
Caleb's room would be hidden,

682
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.740
then, if we made that the case.

683
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.010
TRAVIS: Is there a hidden staircase in the house

684
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.843
that we could--?

685
00:25:41.843 --> 00:25:43.610
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, do you want to hide a--

686
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.851
ASHLEY: You have to pull on one of the

687
00:25:45.851 --> 00:25:46.944
books to get in.
SAM: Wait, you had a book

688
00:25:46.944 --> 00:25:49.411
that you got that you got. That porn book, Caleb,

689
00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:50.344
maybe that could be the book

690
00:25:50.344 --> 00:25:53.460
that you have to pull to open the latch.

691
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.290
LIAM: The seafaring,

692
00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.180
yeah, you have it still.

693
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.013
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

694
00:25:57.013 --> 00:25:58.770
SAM: Okay, we could make that the trigger for.

695
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.873
MATT: The copy of The Hidden Staircase.

696
00:26:00.873 --> 00:26:03.290
(oohing)

697
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.501
TALIESIN: That's--

698
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:07.927
SAM: Never.

699
00:26:07.927 --> 00:26:08.760
TALIESIN: I feel bad now.

700
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.380
Yeah, I may--

701
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.440
I've got some ideas. I may ask your assistance

702
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.790
with a couple of things. I need

703
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.514
to do a little stone shaping, maybe in the--

704
00:26:23.514 --> 00:26:26.470
move some earth, if you can help me with that.

705
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.700
SAM: For your room?

706
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.620
TALIESIN: I've got an idea.

707
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.620
LIAM: It would be rough, but yeah, I could--

708
00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.020
LAURA: I could do some stone shaping.

709
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.184
TALIESIN: You know some stone shaping? All right.

710
00:26:35.184 --> 00:26:36.464
LAURA: Maybe I do.

711
00:26:36.464 --> 00:26:37.740
TALIESIN: Okay, maybe.

712
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.865
TRAVIS: Wooden roof, right?

713
00:26:38.865 --> 00:26:40.468
Beams, thatches, stuff like that?

714
00:26:40.468 --> 00:26:45.260
MATT: Correct, with dark tiles on it, like clay tiles.

715
00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.510
TRAVIS: Cool.

716
00:26:49.004 --> 00:26:50.970
Yeah, I want to watch whatever Caduceus is doing.

717
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.700
MATT: Oh, yeah, Caduceus, what are you doing?

718
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.600
TALIESIN: So--

719
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.213
TRAVIS: Not that I don't have great ambition for my room.

720
00:26:56.213 --> 00:26:59.680
TALIESIN: I'm going to want to move a bunch of dirt.

721
00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.905
I'm going to try and make a rooftop garden

722
00:27:01.905 --> 00:27:03.280
at the top of the tower.

723
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.270
MATT: There is dirt to be found.

724
00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.380
You have to relocate it probably

725
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.360
from the immediate vicinity of the home.

726
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.380
So you will dig up a small hole in one of the nearby--

727
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.960
it's like a ten-foot radial yard around the house,

728
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.950
before you start piercing into nearby neighboring territory.

729
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:20.917
TALIESIN: Sure.
MATT: But yeah, you can amass,

730
00:27:20.917 --> 00:27:22.471
how much dirt are you planning to put up there?

731
00:27:22.471 --> 00:27:25.990
TALIESIN: Enough to support some

732
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:27.290
plant growth.

733
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.110
I'm going to do something dumb.

734
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.943
MATT: Okay.

735
00:27:30.943 --> 00:27:32.910
TALIESIN: And I'm going to use a little Stone Shape

736
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.010
to just shape the tower a little bit

737
00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.990
to be supportive of what I'm going to put up there,

738
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.823
if that works out okay.

739
00:27:39.823 --> 00:27:41.170
MATT: What spell is this in particular?

740
00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:42.670
TALIESIN: Stone Shape.
LAURA: Stone Shape.

741
00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:44.030
LIAM: You have that?
LAURA: I have that.

742
00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.840
LAURA: You're magic.

743
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.673
TALIESIN: It'll take a few days.

744
00:27:46.673 --> 00:27:47.914
This is not a one day project.

745
00:27:47.914 --> 00:27:48.840
This is just a--
MATT: Yes, yeah.

746
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.670
You can totally do that, okay.

747
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.100
So between the two of you, definitely easy.

748
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.350
TALIESIN: It's going to be just rounding it

749
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.130
out a little bit to support what I'm building,

750
00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:02.020
and then also creating a little faux cabin-esque

751
00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.250
little chunk of it so that there's a place to sleep

752
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.350
up there that's covered. I'll draw it out for you.

753
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.183
MATT: Okay.

754
00:28:08.183 --> 00:28:10.638
TALIESIN: And getting the dirt up there is good?

755
00:28:10.638 --> 00:28:13.820
LIAM: I can do that. I use Maximilian's Earthen Grasp

756
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.660
to make the cat's claw come up out of the soil,

757
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.820
and then just travel as soil to the top of the tower,

758
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.220
because it can move.

759
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.830
MATT: That's true.
TALIESIN: That'll do it.

760
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.280
MATT: Even easier.
TALIESIN: So--

761
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.760
MATT: You have a comfortable amount

762
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.830
of loose soil now on the top of your tower.

763
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.870
TALIESIN: I'm going to seed it with my--

764
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.810
anything that's dead in there,

765
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.560
I'm just going to start things going.

766
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.393
MATT: Okay.

767
00:28:37.393 --> 00:28:39.130
SAM: Spread your seed all over?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

768
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.464
I'm going to take a look around.

769
00:28:40.464 --> 00:28:41.297
Thank you for that,

770
00:28:41.297 --> 00:28:42.130
I'm going to take a look around.

771
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.180
LIAM: Look out, Xhorhas!
TRAVIS: Going to grow an eggplant.

772
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.620
TALIESIN: Well, if we're going to be here for a while,

773
00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:52.750
might as well get comfortable. And I'm going to drop right

774
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.050
in the center, the feather, token of the tree.

775
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:57.310
MATT: Oh!
SAM: Feather?

776
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.280
TRAVIS: Shit!

777
00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.340
SAM: Wait.
MATT: Hold on.

778
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.567
SAM: Wait, your tree growing thing?

779
00:29:00.567 --> 00:29:03.910
LIAM: It's a massive tree.
LAURA: On the top of the tower.

780
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.120
ASHLEY: Awesome.
MATT: Okay.

781
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.420
TALIESIN: I've tried to create a little section

782
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.790
that'll hold the roots, and hold the--

783
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.250
MATT: Must be outdoors, yeah, so.

784
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.740
So.

785
00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.000
As you take the token, and drop it into the center

786
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.500
of the little gap you've left in the dirt--

787
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.330
TALIESIN: Hang on.

788
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.580
MATT: The token just rests in there.

789
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.672
TALIESIN: Wait for it.

790
00:29:25.672 --> 00:29:27.740
MATT: (rumbling) You hear this heavy rumbling,

791
00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.290
and you watch as roots just split out

792
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.709
from the center of the token, and dig into the dirt,

793
00:29:33.709 --> 00:29:35.710
and down into the stone, and you feel the stone

794
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.200
shift slightly beneath your feet.

795
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.770
The actual tower seems to be adjusting

796
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.000
in some way to the rooting of this.

797
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.240
Suddenly, a series of branches begin

798
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.120
to extend like rapid spider legs,

799
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.240
and as they reach out, leaves flower

800
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.050
on the edges of these branches until eventually

801
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.440
a large trunk (wood splintering)

802
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.580
fires up into the sky, the canopy expanding above,

803
00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.573
to a 60-foot tall tree, a five-foot diameter trunk,

804
00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.440
which in itself is beautiful. Since all the trees

805
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:10.220
in the region are red and brown in color,

806
00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.260
this is the only green-leafed tree in all of Rosohna.

807
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.880
LAURA: Wow.
TALIESIN: All roots put down.

808
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.870
TRAVIS: Well, now we're going to die.

809
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.270
SAM: It's the tree house. We have a tree house now.

810
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.220
LAURA: It goes so high on top of the tower.

811
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.390
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Wow.

812
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.850
MATT: Make a perception check.
LAURA: Ooh.

813
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.513
MARISHA: We just--
LAURA: Announced--

814
00:30:26.513 --> 00:30:28.330
MARISHA: Made a statement.
TALIESIN: 15.

815
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.470
MATT: 15.

816
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.741
You hear out of the corner of your eye.

817
00:30:31.741 --> 00:30:35.000
Your firbolg ear tweaks a bit.

818
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.620
Ear even, (clicks) corner of your ear.

819
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.423
It's been a long--
TALIESIN: It's been a day.

820
00:30:38.423 --> 00:30:39.939
MATT: It's been a day.
TALIESIN: Sorry, my fault.

821
00:30:39.939 --> 00:30:40.960
LIAM: Hundreds and hundreds of hours of narration.

822
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.010
MATT: It's fine. It's cool. You hear a few voices,

823
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.130
and you glance up and down in the street.

824
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:50.650
You can see various civilians of Rosohna gathering

825
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.280
in the street, and all looking up

826
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.760
at this massive tree that has sprung out of nowhere.

827
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.620
They're gathering and pointing, and grabbing other folks,

828
00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.210
and there's a crowd gathering now on the outskirts

829
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.410
of your house, as those of you who have gathered up

830
00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.690
on top of the rooftop and the tower

831
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:07.050
to see what has happened glance over,

832
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.070
and see the neighbors, very curious, and some

833
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:13.068
of them concerned about this massive green tree now,

834
00:31:13.068 --> 00:31:16.210
a spire beacon in the center of this neighborhood

835
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.043
in the Firmaments.

836
00:31:17.043 --> 00:31:18.730
TRAVIS: We haven't even been here half a day.

837
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:19.810
MARISHA: Did we check the lease?

838
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.374
Are we able to make modifications

839
00:31:21.374 --> 00:31:23.360
to the house?

840
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.118
TRAVIS: There goes our security deposit.

841
00:31:25.118 --> 00:31:27.200
(laughter)

842
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.190
LIAM: After a scurrying sound, Frumpkin just starts climbing

843
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.050
up the length of the tree, and disappears into the heights.

844
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.690
LAURA: Nugget goes and pees on it.

845
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.990
MATT: Immediately.
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, I know.

846
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.000
TRAVIS: In the time that we've been here,

847
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.230
is it particularly windy in this area of Xhorhas?

848
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.330
MATT: Make a nature check.

849
00:31:44.708 --> 00:31:47.170
LAURA: Can I see the map?
ASHLEY: Oh, yes, yes.

850
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.003
TRAVIS: 11.

851
00:31:48.003 --> 00:31:49.670
MATT: 11. You didn't need to make the check.

852
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.330
I just wanted to make you.
TRAVIS: Oh.

853
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.780
MATT: You'd know if it was windy or not.

854
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.913
It can vary.
(laughter)

855
00:31:56.913 --> 00:31:59.530
MATT: It can vary. It's not particularly windy,

856
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.350
in the experience of the time that you've been here so far,

857
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.640
except during the storm. The storm,

858
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.420
it got a little windy. You do notice,

859
00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.180
at the height of the tree is at, 60 feet up

860
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.300
from this point, though, there is more wind above

861
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.650
than there is ground level.

862
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:11.990
It seems like the buildings

863
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.170
and the structures seem to guide most--

864
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.440
TALIESIN: If I have to top the tree, I'll top the tree.

865
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.900
You're not supposed to do it, but I'll do it if I have to.

866
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.710
MATT: It's not terribly windy, but you can see

867
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.390
the 20 foot canopy, it's (wind blowing).

868
00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.580
You can hear the rustling of the leaves.

869
00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.000
It's actually really pretty and soothing.

870
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.750
TALIESIN: The trick is now are going to be figuring

871
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.400
out if there's a way that I can...

872
00:32:31.457 --> 00:32:32.630
LAURA: Keep it alive?

873
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.090
TALIESIN: Well, that's the thing, is I'm going to have to

874
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.920
figure out a way of maybe imbuing a couple objects

875
00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.780
with some very basic Daylight spells

876
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.860
that I can trigger off once a day.

877
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.910
MATT: There is that, yeah.

878
00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.420
TALIESIN: So I may have to go looking for that,

879
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.960
or talk to the clever, clever kids about that.

880
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.400
MARISHA: I mean, it's a magic tree that came out

881
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.050
of a token. Does it need sunlight?

882
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.921
TALIESIN: I honestly planned on growing

883
00:32:52.921 --> 00:32:54.444
a lot more than just a tree.

884
00:32:54.444 --> 00:32:55.277
MARISHA: Oh.

885
00:32:55.277 --> 00:32:58.127
LAURA: The tree will be the sun for other things.

886
00:32:58.127 --> 00:33:01.335
(laughter)

887
00:33:01.335 --> 00:33:03.840
TALIESIN: I don't think I can cast a Sunlight spell that--

888
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.670
that's a lot of-- that's a very expensive Sunlight spell.

889
00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:08.968
If we're going to be building a--

890
00:33:08.968 --> 00:33:10.551
that's for the basement, okay.

891
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:11.640
MATT: The campaign ends

892
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.777
with the Mighty Nein opening a dispensary.

893
00:33:13.777 --> 00:33:15.243
in Rosohna.

894
00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:16.276
LIAM: Hydroponics.

895
00:33:16.276 --> 00:33:17.390
LAURA: You know what? It would make perfect sense.

896
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:18.223
MATT: There you go.

897
00:33:18.223 --> 00:33:20.360
TALIESIN: It's a fitting end.

898
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.200
No, but I thought it would be nice

899
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.290
to have a proper garden that reminds us of home,

900
00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.290
and a place where we can have a little sliver

901
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.580
of something that isn't this place

902
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.890
and I'm going to-- I have a few needs

903
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.433
and growing things in some sunlight is one of them--

904
00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:39.350
SAM: Sure, having a giant 60 foot tree

905
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.580
in your bedroom is a totally basic need

906
00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.413
that I think we can all--

907
00:33:42.413 --> 00:33:44.130
TALIESIN: Something I've had my entire life.

908
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:44.963
SAM: Sure.

909
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.910
TALIESIN: Don't have a lot of needs. This is one of them.

910
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.730
MATT: The crowd isn't dispersing, but they definitely are

911
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.060
aware that you're aware of them, so they're being quieter.

912
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.190
TALIESIN: I may go down and say hello to everyone,

913
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:59.601
to people at the gate.

914
00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:03.910
MATT: All right, yeah. You meet some of the passersby.

915
00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.509
They seem...

916
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.200
...curious, and definitely a bit off-put by both the

917
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.150
presence of the tree and the general lack

918
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:18.070
of firbolgs in Rosohna. Some of them are curious,

919
00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.770
some of them are dubious.

920
00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:21.603
TALIESIN: That's fair.

921
00:34:21.603 --> 00:34:24.090
MATT: But nothing, nothing beyond that.

922
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.720
A few hands are shaken, a few conversations are had.

923
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.660
Then slowly, people begin to disperse a bit,

924
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.670
though their attention is still over their shoulder

925
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:36.280
in this strange, new visual wooden monolith

926
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.170
that sits in the center of the district.

927
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.720
TALIESIN: Just going to get weirder.

928
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.370
So excited. I have so many plans.

929
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:43.203
MATT: Perfect.

930
00:34:44.596 --> 00:34:46.000
Anything else anyone wants to do with it?

931
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.490
LIAM: Why don't we make this room a meeting room,

932
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:50.995
a planning room?

933
00:34:50.995 --> 00:34:52.992
LAURA: Sounds like a good idea.

934
00:34:52.992 --> 00:34:53.829
SAM: The war room.

935
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:54.662
LIAM: The war room.

936
00:34:55.556 --> 00:34:56.389
SAM: Okay.

937
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:57.500
TALIESIN: We need a, just a--

938
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.780
SAM: We need to go shopping and stuff.

939
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.023
LAURA: Yeah.

940
00:35:01.023 --> 00:35:01.856
TALIESIN: Hopefully this is just a thing.

941
00:35:01.856 --> 00:35:03.400
We can just hang out in these places. It's nice.

942
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.300
LAURA: These are just open--

943
00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.190
LIAM: This last one could be maybe a guest room?

944
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.780
LAURA: Yeah, sure, why not?
MARISHA: Slash prison.

945
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.530
SAM: But, Beauregard, didn't you want

946
00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.900
some sort of a training pit or something?

947
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.124
ASHLEY: But that's what we're doing downstairs, yeah.

948
00:35:17.124 --> 00:35:18.800
LIAM: Yeah, we have training, we have study,

949
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.980
we have the happy room, the war room,

950
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.813
right next to each other.

951
00:35:22.813 --> 00:35:24.182
SAM: Oh, happy and war room.

952
00:35:24.182 --> 00:35:25.920
(laughter)

953
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.900
LIAM: The kitchen and dining room, the kitchen

954
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.520
and dining room, so really the only--

955
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.158
and Caduceus is up top here, so the only thing--

956
00:35:36.491 --> 00:35:38.624
MARISHA: I love that book, War and Happy.

957
00:35:38.624 --> 00:35:41.230
SAM: Well, let's leave that for when we have a need.

958
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.063
LIAM: That's a good idea.

959
00:35:42.063 --> 00:35:44.670
LAURA: It's guest-room-to-be, but storage right now.

960
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.503
TALIESIN: Room of Requirement.

961
00:35:45.503 --> 00:35:46.520
LAURA: Yes, Room of Requirement, for sure.

962
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.230
ASHLEY: After we talk about things in the war room,

963
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.230
then we can go into the happy room.

964
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.049
MARISHA: To cool off.
ASHLEY: To cool off.

965
00:35:53.049 --> 00:35:54.595
LAURA: And just dance around, and, like.

966
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.259
TALIESIN: Safety dance.

967
00:35:58.392 --> 00:35:59.440
SAM: I feel good about this.

968
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.861
MATT: Great.

969
00:36:00.861 --> 00:36:02.140
(laughter)

970
00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:02.980
MATT: Well done, guys.

971
00:36:05.502 --> 00:36:07.140
TALIESIN: I feel like the neighbor in Mary Poppins,

972
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.180
who just fires off the cannon every hour.

973
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.710
MATT: Yes, there you go.

974
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.010
All righty, so in choosing your rooms,

975
00:36:16.147 --> 00:36:17.890
I imagine you wish to furnish them.

976
00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.640
Are there any specific requests?

977
00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.960
MARISHA: Well, we're going to need sheets, towels--

978
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.180
MATT: They come with sheets. They don't come with towels,

979
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.013
we'll say, we'll say--

980
00:36:28.013 --> 00:36:28.846
TRAVIS: There's a bed and a mattress?

981
00:36:28.846 --> 00:36:31.740
MATT: We'll say for, yeah, there's a bed and mattresses.

982
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.840
For basic functional needs here,

983
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.750
it'll be ten gold to furnish

984
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.210
for all of you guys in the house

985
00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:44.800
for your basic towels, linens,

986
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.050
things like that.
LIAM: Chamber pots.

987
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.350
LAURA: Oh, yeah, we don't have a bathroom.

988
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.183
LIAM: Chamber pots.

989
00:36:50.183 --> 00:36:51.704
TALIESIN: There's probably an outhouse or--

990
00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.493
TRAVIS: There we go.

991
00:36:53.493 --> 00:36:55.259
SAM: We could make that to-be-determined room

992
00:36:55.259 --> 00:36:56.240
just a shit room.

993
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.073
TALIESIN: No, god.

994
00:36:57.073 --> 00:36:58.613
MATT: That explains the stain in the basement.

995
00:36:58.613 --> 00:37:00.440
(groaning)

996
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.240
LIAM: DM, what would I need to pay extra

997
00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.660
for there to be bookshelves

998
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.810
and alchemical laboratory equipment?

999
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.470
MATT: There are bookshelves there. There just aren't any

1000
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.300
books on them, and that would be in the one

1001
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.120
that you've turned into the library slash laboratory,

1002
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.150
as well as the room you're considering a prison room.

1003
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.354
MARISHA: I've got the basic furnishings.

1004
00:37:16.354 --> 00:37:17.220
MATT: If you're looking to

1005
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.400
acquire an alchemical--

1006
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.330
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: For laboratory.

1007
00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:21.163
LIAM: For Nott.

1008
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.728
MATT: That would be.

1009
00:37:24.728 --> 00:37:25.740
TALIESIN: I'm going to be doing a lot of--

1010
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.850
MATT: They're

1011
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.380
50 gold pieces for a set of alchemical supplies.

1012
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.280
LIAM: I cover it.

1013
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.113
MATT: You cover it, all right.

1014
00:37:32.113 --> 00:37:36.653
LAURA: Can I buy a lot of paints?

1015
00:37:36.653 --> 00:37:39.210
MATT: A lot of paints, yeah. For a set of painter supplies,

1016
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.080
it's ten gold. You can buy multiple sets, if you want.

1017
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.030
TALIESIN: I've been thinking about this all week.

1018
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.810
LAURA: Yeah, I need a lot.

1019
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.590
MATT: Define a lot.

1020
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:47.320
SAM: She's going to paint the house.

1021
00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.530
MATT: You're going to paint the house?

1022
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.090
LAURA: I'm going to paint a lot of things

1023
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:51.490
on the walls--
MATT: I would recommend,

1024
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.280
then, dropping somewhere in the neighborhood of

1025
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.330
70 to 80 gold of painter supplies

1026
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:56.680
to paint the entire house.

1027
00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.400
LAURA: Well, not every, all the house.

1028
00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.940
I'm going to paint some of the rooms.

1029
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.700
MATT: Oh, some of the rooms, okay.

1030
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.640
LAURA: Not the outside of the house.

1031
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.111
MATT: How many rooms?

1032
00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:07.890
LAURA: Probably like three rooms or something.

1033
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.830
MATT: I'll put that three painter supply kits.

1034
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:11.997
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: 30 gold.

1035
00:38:11.997 --> 00:38:13.940
LAURA: 30 gold, you got it.
MATT: All righty.

1036
00:38:15.415 --> 00:38:17.240
TALIESIN: I just want to sort of recreate

1037
00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:22.150
what I had at home, so very simple stuff,

1038
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.460
but then I'm going to want some gardening supplies,

1039
00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.407
and some stuff for that, and then--

1040
00:38:26.407 --> 00:38:27.240
MATT: Yeah.

1041
00:38:28.388 --> 00:38:30.360
There aren't any supplies you can easily put together

1042
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.193
with five gold.

1043
00:38:31.193 --> 00:38:33.990
TALIESIN: Some things like that, and then also up there--

1044
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.750
well, the complicated things we'll figure

1045
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.300
out a little bit later with the light,

1046
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.620
but I also want to sculpt it a bit.

1047
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.490
I'm thinking about the garden at Lake Shrine,

1048
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.660
if you remember.

1049
00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:45.493
MATT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1050
00:38:45.493 --> 00:38:48.000
TALIESIN: I want to have little alcoves either

1051
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.260
in the tree or in the stone, as we go together,

1052
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.110
probably a bit of both, that give everybody who has a...

1053
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.830
who has a god a little shrine,

1054
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.990
like a micro shrine for everybody. So there's a--

1055
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.820
MATT: That can totally be done. It's a tight space,

1056
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.053
because it is a five foot tree in the middle

1057
00:39:03.053 --> 00:39:04.790
of what is essentially a 20-foot--

1058
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:07.540
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, it's going to go up the tree, too, so.

1059
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.003
LAURA: Oh, up the trunk, and in the branches?

1060
00:39:10.003 --> 00:39:12.300
MATT: Easy enough for you to do. It'll take you a little bit

1061
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.690
of time to carve the alcoves in the actual tree.

1062
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:14.523
TALIESIN: Take time.

1063
00:39:14.523 --> 00:39:16.050
MATT: The stone is a little easier to shape,

1064
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.000
based on the spell.

1065
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.020
But yeah, you can totally do that without issue.

1066
00:39:22.174 --> 00:39:23.674
TRAVIS: The windows on the bedrooms,

1067
00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.560
glass pane?
MATT: Glass paned, yeah.

1068
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.482
TRAVIS: Yeah, do they open, solid, latched?

1069
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.580
MATT: The ones that are in more open chambers,

1070
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.808
we'll say what is now the training room,

1071
00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:39.960
the dining room, those all can open.

1072
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.390
There are, not every room has it,

1073
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.330
just places for possible cross breeze, and--

1074
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.713
TRAVIS: Would they have wooden shutters,

1075
00:39:47.713 --> 00:39:49.363
like storm shutters?

1076
00:39:51.794 --> 00:39:54.240
MATT: I would say no, it doesn't seem like there are storms

1077
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.610
that bad that come through here

1078
00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.960
to require that, those aren't--

1079
00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.830
TRAVIS: Could I pay to have some wooden shutters put

1080
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.610
on the inside of the windows?

1081
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:01.443
MATT: That can be done.

1082
00:40:01.443 --> 00:40:02.330
TRAVIS: Okay.

1083
00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:03.163
TALIESIN: Interesting.

1084
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.771
MATT: I'd say, on all the windows?

1085
00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:08.780
TRAVIS: Just on mine.

1086
00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.613
MATT: Okay.

1087
00:40:09.613 --> 00:40:11.470
TRAVIS: Unless the ladies also want some

1088
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.130
ability to, I don't know,

1089
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:17.260
get some daytime Zs, you know, outside of curtains.

1090
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.460
LAURA: It's all dark, anyway.

1091
00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:22.871
TRAVIS: Well, yeah. I'm just offering, you can just say no.

1092
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:24.910
(laughter)

1093
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:26.340
LAURA: No, I'm okay, are you okay?

1094
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.845
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm good.
LAURA: Okay.

1095
00:40:27.845 --> 00:40:29.900
TRAVIS: Yeah, shutters for one.

1096
00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.400
MATT: All right, supplies and insulation, a gold piece.

1097
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.160
TRAVIS: You've got it, deal.

1098
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.393
ASHLEY: What were the gardening supplies,

1099
00:40:36.393 --> 00:40:37.751
what did they cost?

1100
00:40:37.751 --> 00:40:38.710
MATT: Oh, those are five gold.

1101
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.730
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, so I'm just ten gold in.

1102
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.400
ASHLEY: I would like to get a set of those, as well,

1103
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.860
because I want to help out--

1104
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.310
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, we can-- oh, man, I'm,

1105
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:47.593
yeah, it's going to be nonstop.
MATT: Okay.

1106
00:40:47.593 --> 00:40:52.195
LAURA: When Yasha and Caduceus are distracted gardening,

1107
00:40:52.195 --> 00:40:56.490
I'm going to go into Yasha's room, and I'm going to--

1108
00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.390
SAM: Paint a mural.

1109
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:58.740
LAURA: I am, though.
SAM: Okay, good.

1110
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.200
LAURA: I'm going to go in her room, and I'm going to paint

1111
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.802
a field of wildflowers on her wall.

1112
00:41:03.802 --> 00:41:04.710
ALL: Aww.

1113
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.690
TRAVIS: So into that shit.

1114
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.610
ASHLEY: Oh no, I'm going to cry.

1115
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:14.318
MATT: I will say make a performance check with advantage.

1116
00:41:16.457 --> 00:41:18.427
LAURA: The big one?
LIAM: Yes!

1117
00:41:18.427 --> 00:41:19.518
MATT: This isn't about accuracy,

1118
00:41:19.518 --> 00:41:21.993
this is about the beauty of the show.

1119
00:41:21.993 --> 00:41:23.910
LAURA: -- advantage. 13?

1120
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.688
MATT: 13, yeah, that's more than enough.

1121
00:41:25.688 --> 00:41:26.680
LAURA: Okay!

1122
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.930
MATT: You do it quickly. They get back before you finish,

1123
00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:34.500
but as you arrive, Yasha, and go to throw supplies

1124
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.200
into your room, you come in as you see a frantic Jester

1125
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.033
trying to finish.
LAURA: Close your eyes, close your eyes,

1126
00:41:37.033 --> 00:41:38.690
close your eyes!

1127
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.250
ASHLEY: I close my eyes, but halfway open one of them.

1128
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.200
LAURA: It's almost done.

1129
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.330
ASHLEY: Jester.

1130
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.848
LAURA: Well, I just remembered how much you loved seeing

1131
00:41:48.848 --> 00:41:53.000
them and everything, and it's very dark here, and--

1132
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.870
ASHLEY: This is so beautiful.

1133
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:59.180
Thank you so much! This is such a nice thing that you did.

1134
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.760
LAURA: Well, you know.

1135
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:03.700
ASHLEY: Is it dry?

1136
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.533
LAURA: No.

1137
00:42:04.533 --> 00:42:05.366
ASHLEY: Okay.

1138
00:42:05.366 --> 00:42:07.140
LAURA: Don't touch it yet.

1139
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.660
But then when it's dry, you can go over

1140
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.878
and touch it all you want.

1141
00:42:10.878 --> 00:42:12.590
ASHLEY: I love it so much, thank you, Jester.

1142
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:13.700
LAURA: You're welcome.

1143
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.950
ASHLEY: Oh, this is beautiful.

1144
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.670
LAURA: If you want anything else painted in there,

1145
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:18.950
you just let me know.

1146
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.090
ASHLEY: Okay, I will let you know, thank you so much.

1147
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:22.140
LAURA: You're welcome.

1148
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.448
There's a dick hidden somewhere in there.

1149
00:42:25.608 --> 00:42:26.441
MATT: A hidden dicky?

1150
00:42:26.441 --> 00:42:27.340
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll see if I can find it.

1151
00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.506
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1152
00:42:29.506 --> 00:42:32.210
I'm going to move my bed close, not touching yet,

1153
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.990
because I know it's not dry, but I'm going to make sure,

1154
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.670
I want to sleep next to it.

1155
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:38.070
MATT: And there is a way, the way it's painted,

1156
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.360
if you put the bed and you lay it back,

1157
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.720
you feel like you're laying in a field,

1158
00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.878
which is really nice.

1159
00:42:42.878 --> 00:42:44.878
ASHLEY: That's the best.

1160
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.013
MATT: All righty.

1161
00:42:47.013 --> 00:42:48.250
LIAM: A couple things for the house?

1162
00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:49.090
MATT: Yes?

1163
00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:52.470
LIAM: So once the laboratory is installed

1164
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.290
with the library, I would take time to check out

1165
00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:58.840
if there are any books of worth or notice left behind.

1166
00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:00.790
MATT: There are no books in the library.

1167
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.060
LIAM: Oh, I thought you said there were a few books--

1168
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.690
MATT: No, I said there were bookshelves, but no books.

1169
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.030
LIAM: I thought you said both, forget that.

1170
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.690
So instead, I would spend a couple

1171
00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:11.500
of hours taking my limitless spool of silver thread,

1172
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.410
and permanently affix silver thread along the windows

1173
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.440
in my room, permanently there,

1174
00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.390
and also on the doorway to my bedroom.

1175
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.510
Also on the door to the laboratory

1176
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.120
that leads to my bedroom, and I would set them so

1177
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.980
that there is a different toned chime in my head

1178
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.720
for each one of those three.

1179
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.770
And that will be my bedtime ritual, any time I go to sleep

1180
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.390
in this house, will be to set those three things.

1181
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.060
MATT: You got it.

1182
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:38.893
Cool.

1183
00:43:38.893 --> 00:43:40.770
MARISHA: Hey, what about my room?

1184
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.587
What about mine and Jester's?

1185
00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.673
LIAM: That's a lot of--

1186
00:43:44.673 --> 00:43:45.506
MARISHA: What about the whole house?

1187
00:43:45.506 --> 00:43:47.030
LIAM: That's a lot of chimes.
LAURA: Can you, would be--

1188
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:48.620
MARISHA: Could you do the house?
LAURA: Would we hear the chimes,

1189
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.300
or would you just hear the chimes?

1190
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.047
LIAM: It could be either or.

1191
00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:55.097
But it would be like a,

1192
00:43:56.077 --> 00:43:58.507
an hour to do that every night.

1193
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.990
ASHLEY: It's a chime whenever you set out--

1194
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:06.210
LIAM: I can work this spell so that an audible chime is

1195
00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.370
heard by anyone within earshot, or I can have it

1196
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:13.150
so just I hear it, but it takes some time, each one, but--

1197
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.610
LAURA: Every night?

1198
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.797
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

1199
00:44:15.797 --> 00:44:16.630
LAURA: Oh.

1200
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.796
TALIESIN: I got an idea.

1201
00:44:17.796 --> 00:44:18.896
MATT: What's your idea?

1202
00:44:18.896 --> 00:44:20.079
ASHLEY: Oh, you have to do it every night.

1203
00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:23.340
TALIESIN: Watch this. I'm going to

1204
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.580
purchase some--

1205
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:27.980
go to the blacksmith, I suppose,

1206
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.060
and purchase some copper tubing.

1207
00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.180
MATT: Okay, which

1208
00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.420
is a little pricey right now,

1209
00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.930
since the mine had been shut down for a while,

1210
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:37.180
and it was the largest source of copper.

1211
00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.470
TALIESIN: It's fine, not a ton.

1212
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:39.900
Just a couple different pieces.

1213
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.440
MATT: Okay, how big and how long?

1214
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.530
TALIESIN: About, about this, this big,

1215
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.290
like, three or four--
LAURA: About. (laughs)

1216
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:48.123
MATT: I knew to look right at Laura after I said that.

1217
00:44:48.123 --> 00:44:48.956
Continue.

1218
00:44:48.956 --> 00:44:50.622
(laughter)

1219
00:44:50.622 --> 00:44:51.690
TALIESIN: I'm going to string them up. I'm just going to--

1220
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:54.900
I'm going to hang, basically, a wind chime

1221
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.530
behind the main door, so that now there's a sound

1222
00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.950
that happens any time someone, that we can all hear.

1223
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:02.710
MATT: I'll say five silver.

1224
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.543
TALIESIN: Done.

1225
00:45:03.543 --> 00:45:04.376
MATT: Five silver for the piece.

1226
00:45:04.376 --> 00:45:05.260
MARISHA: Classic.

1227
00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.210
TALIESIN: We have a sound

1228
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.510
that will make any time someone enters the house now.

1229
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.343
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: If they come

1230
00:45:10.343 --> 00:45:13.619
to kill us through the front door.

1231
00:45:13.619 --> 00:45:15.640
SAM: We're spending some time for a few days

1232
00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.960
getting our house up and running?

1233
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.310
MATT: Well, if you guys are--

1234
00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.420
you were talking about going to the

1235
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.030
Overcrow.
SAM: Oh, yeah.

1236
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.510
MATT: Or at least there is that

1237
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:26.850
meeting happening.

1238
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.220
LAURA: Two weeks before that happens.

1239
00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.280
MATT: Yeah, I'll say, I'll say with all this setup here,

1240
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.467
we're just taking probably a couple days worth of,

1241
00:45:32.467 --> 00:45:34.570
preparing, you have about 11 days left before

1242
00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:35.660
that's supposed to be happening,

1243
00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:36.800
or it'd actually be ten days.

1244
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.830
TALIESIN: I had an irritating thing I wanted to do,

1245
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:40.910
I had an irritating cleric thing I wanted to do at the end

1246
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.850
of the night before we ended the last game.

1247
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:47.450
Which is I have this spell called Legend Lore.

1248
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.330
I wanted to cast it on the sword,

1249
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:52.080
the two sword pieces that I have.

1250
00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.890
LAURA: On the what, on the what?

1251
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.980
SAM: Oh, the sword?
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!

1252
00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.590
SAM: The sword, we got to fucking figure out the sword.

1253
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.310
MARISHA: Yeah, I gave you the sword.

1254
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.304
By the way.

1255
00:46:04.304 --> 00:46:06.704
LIAM and MARISHA: In the days since we've been here.

1256
00:46:06.704 --> 00:46:08.002
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure it happened.

1257
00:46:08.002 --> 00:46:08.934
SAM: (like Beau) Gave you the sword.

1258
00:46:08.934 --> 00:46:10.280
TALIESIN: I want to cast Legend Lore on that.

1259
00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.550
TRAVIS: Can you do that once a day?
TALIESIN: I can do that once a day,

1260
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:14.500
as long as I'm pretty convinced

1261
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.510
that nothing terrible is going to happen.

1262
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.470
LAURA: Right, I could do that, too.

1263
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:19.303
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1264
00:46:19.303 --> 00:46:20.650
LAURA: To help out if, you know.

1265
00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:22.760
MATT: You do have to buy 250 gold worth of incense.

1266
00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.223
TALIESIN: Oh, it is, that's right, it is,

1267
00:46:25.223 --> 00:46:26.180
that's right.
SAM: A spendy spell?

1268
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.390
TALIESIN: It is a spendy spell, that's fair.

1269
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:31.015
MATT: And four ivory strips, and they're worth 50 gold each.

1270
00:46:31.015 --> 00:46:33.569
TALIESIN: Okay.

1271
00:46:33.569 --> 00:46:34.530
MATT: It consumes 250 gold worth

1272
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.113
of incense every time you cast it.

1273
00:46:37.113 --> 00:46:38.590
And you have to have the, it doesn't consume the ivory,

1274
00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:40.770
but you need about 250 gold worth of ivory.

1275
00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:42.503
TALIESIN: Okay.
LAURA: It doesn't consume it, though?

1276
00:46:42.503 --> 00:46:43.336
MATT: It doesn't consume the ivory,

1277
00:46:43.336 --> 00:46:44.819
but it consumes the incense,

1278
00:46:44.819 --> 00:46:46.930
so it essentially costs you--

1279
00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.470
450 first time,

1280
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.620
and then 250 every additional time you want to cast it.

1281
00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.867
SAM: I feel like it's worth it.

1282
00:46:52.867 --> 00:46:54.433
LIAM: Boy, that would have been super sweet

1283
00:46:54.433 --> 00:46:55.266
with the dodecahedron.

1284
00:46:55.266 --> 00:46:57.010
LAURA: I can put in 50 gold.

1285
00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:59.340
TALIESIN: I've got some money, let's see what I got.

1286
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.360
Except first, though, I mean, like,

1287
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.200
that's the thing, is the sun spell is

1288
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.250
by far my biggest thing I'm trying to get,

1289
00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:07.430
so this may have to wait if we--

1290
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:08.890
MATT: Up to you.

1291
00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:10.720
TALIESIN: How difficult would it be to figure out how

1292
00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.830
to enchant some object to just give me a few hours

1293
00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:16.600
of sunlight up there to keep the plants alive,

1294
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.540
and everything copacetic?

1295
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:20.110
MATT: What level's the spell?

1296
00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:21.776
TALIESIN: Sunlight?

1297
00:47:21.776 --> 00:47:22.609
LAURA: I think it's a level five.

1298
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:23.442
Daylight is five.

1299
00:47:23.442 --> 00:47:25.640
TALIESIN: but that's damaging daylight.

1300
00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.430
I mean, technically speaking, if I have,

1301
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.040
a whole bunch of tiny light spells,

1302
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.600
would that be enough to keep a garden?

1303
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.240
LAURA: Like, the cantrip?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1304
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.450
MATT: It is not considered sunlight.

1305
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:36.180
There is Daylight, which is a 3rd-level spell.

1306
00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.390
LAURA and TALIESIN: Okay.

1307
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:42.151
MATT: Lasts for an hour, in order to enchant it permanently,

1308
00:47:42.151 --> 00:47:45.380
I would say, let me double check here.

1309
00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.500
TALIESIN: Yeah, you get what I'm trying.

1310
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.628
Yeah, nothing damaging. I'm just trying to

1311
00:47:49.628 --> 00:47:52.162
make a happy place.

1312
00:47:52.162 --> 00:47:54.170
But I'm aware this is weird.

1313
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:55.720
LIAM: Even the drift globe that I have

1314
00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.490
only casts the spell, so it's one hour, so that idea.

1315
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:59.817
MATT: I would say it would take about--

1316
00:47:59.817 --> 00:48:01.630
MARISHA: ♪ Sun shine in! ♪

1317
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.088
MATT: -- depending on the roll, one to two weeks

1318
00:48:03.088 --> 00:48:03.921
to complete it,

1319
00:48:03.921 --> 00:48:06.160
and costs about 200 gold worth of supplies.

1320
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.177
TALIESIN: Okay.
LAURA: What should we put in our room?

1321
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.673
MATT: So if you wanted to do that,

1322
00:48:10.673 --> 00:48:12.010
it'll take up probably the majority

1323
00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:15.843
of the time you have left, but it can be done.

1324
00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.465
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think, I mean, like--

1325
00:48:22.465 --> 00:48:23.970
MATT: At least eight hours a day of focusing

1326
00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:25.903
on the enchantment and crafting.
SAM: It's going to die otherwise

1327
00:48:25.903 --> 00:48:26.736
TALIESIN: Hmm?

1328
00:48:26.736 --> 00:48:27.569
SAM: That tree's going to die--

1329
00:48:27.569 --> 00:48:28.402
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I got to do it,

1330
00:48:28.402 --> 00:48:29.493
so I'm going to do it. Yeah.

1331
00:48:29.493 --> 00:48:32.120
MATT: Okay, so mark off 200 gold.

1332
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.840
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: Of supplies for that.

1333
00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.673
LAURA: We can help?

1334
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.150
TALIESIN: I'll take a little help.

1335
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:39.960
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll plug in some, too.

1336
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.070
LAURA: I'll put in, I'll put in 30 gold.

1337
00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:45.940
TALIESIN: 30 gold, so that's-- now I'm at 170.

1338
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.023
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll put in--

1339
00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:49.040
MATT: If somebody else has the capability to cast Daylight,

1340
00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.730
as well, and they want to take the time to help you,

1341
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.378
you can reduce the time in half.

1342
00:48:52.378 --> 00:48:54.910
TALIESIN: That would be amazing, okay, awesome.

1343
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:58.810
So I'll spend 100 gold, if you guys can

1344
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:01.540
put 30 in-- Well, here, I'll spend 100 and,

1345
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.373
she spent 30--

1346
00:49:02.373 --> 00:49:03.206
ASHLEY: What's the price on it again?

1347
00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:04.320
TALIESIN: 200 gold.

1348
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.470
So I'll put in, if you've got 30 in already,

1349
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:07.820
I'll put in--
LAURA: This sounds like we're--

1350
00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.830
TALIESIN: 120.
LAURA: Okay.

1351
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:09.850
Figuring out a tab, yes.

1352
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:11.090
TALIESIN: If you've got 50, all right.

1353
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.290
MATT: So what are you enchanting it into?

1354
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:14.490
What is the means of you developing this item,

1355
00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:15.790
since you are creating it?

1356
00:49:16.763 --> 00:49:18.040
And I think it's the first created magical item

1357
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:18.873
in this campaign.

1358
00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:19.706
TALIESIN: It is technically

1359
00:49:19.706 --> 00:49:22.040
the first created magical item.

1360
00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:25.610
I basically want to

1361
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.720
make Christmas lights.
LAURA: Can we put them in, like,

1362
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.861
yeah, like little flasks, like gold--

1363
00:49:30.861 --> 00:49:32.340
TALIESIN: Maybe making a liquid that I can then,

1364
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.140
like a liquid that I can then pour off

1365
00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.002
to fill the tree with.

1366
00:49:36.002 --> 00:49:38.020
LAURA: Like market lights, beautiful.

1367
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.180
TALIESIN: So yeah, a lot of liquid.

1368
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.490
MATT: Okay, I will say, I will say technically,

1369
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:44.240
for that amount of lights--
LAURA: Technically?

1370
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.040
MATT: Technically, for both the tree and the garden, and

1371
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.350
for the length of what you're doing, both working together.

1372
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:51.420
I would say it would take twice as much time

1373
00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.660
to create that amount, but since you're helping

1374
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.580
with it, it reduces the time.

1375
00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.586
It does cost twice as much, so it'd be 400 gold total,

1376
00:49:58.586 --> 00:50:00.510
but that would be for the tree and the garden.

1377
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.210
SAM: Super worth it.

1378
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:03.870
LAURA: Who else can put some gold--

1379
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:05.090
LIAM: I can put in--

1380
00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.830
TALIESIN: All right, I'm doing 100 and

1381
00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.890
I can do

1382
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:10.220
150, so.

1383
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:12.680
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: I'll burn 150 worth.

1384
00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.813
LAURA: I'll put in another 20 gold.

1385
00:50:14.813 --> 00:50:15.788
TRAVIS: I'm can put in 20,

1386
00:50:15.788 --> 00:50:19.479
if you need, or if you're there, no worries.

1387
00:50:19.479 --> 00:50:20.470
MARISHA: I'll toss 20, as well.

1388
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.570
TALIESIN: Thanks. I feel like this is

1389
00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:23.110
a good investment.

1390
00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.710
SAM: So we're the house on the block with a 60 foot tree

1391
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.940
on our roof, and--
LAURA: Market lights.

1392
00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.510
SAM: And lights.
MATT: Yeah.

1393
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.370
LAURA: Our place is going to look so fucking cool.

1394
00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.020
MARISHA: With a bistro.

1395
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:34.890
MATT: So.

1396
00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.600
MARISHA: We could get piano music.

1397
00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.850
MATT: Since Jester's helping you,

1398
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.492
I'll have you guys both roll a d20,

1399
00:50:40.492 --> 00:50:44.380
and then I'll say add your wisdom modifier.

1400
00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.440
TALIESIN: Okay.

1401
00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.376
ASHLEY: Can the lights change colors?

1402
00:50:47.376 --> 00:50:49.534
SAM: Hi, we just moved in!
MARISHA: -- customs!

1403
00:50:50.578 --> 00:50:51.729
LIAM: We're the Griswolds.

1404
00:50:51.729 --> 00:50:54.030
SAM: We are the Griswolds.

1405
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:55.100
TALIESIN: 19.

1406
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.620
MATT: 19?

1407
00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.510
LAURA: 12.

1408
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.200
MATT: That's fine. Yeah, so there wasn't,

1409
00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.550
there was no catastrophic failure. In the process,

1410
00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:04.760
you didn't waste your materials in the time spent.

1411
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.810
So over this period of time, you begin to

1412
00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.780
take thick cording,

1413
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.870
and a series of glass jars, and you instill each one

1414
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.670
of these jars upon where it connects with it,

1415
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:17.170
with an element of the Daylight spell.

1416
00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:19.700
So opposed to the one singular globe of energy,

1417
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:24.140
you produce a string of lights with, I would say,

1418
00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:27.950
between the two, a total of close to 100 feet

1419
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:30.268
of tiny Daylight orbs.

1420
00:51:30.268 --> 00:51:33.741
LIAM: ♪ Deck Xhorhas with balls of Daylight ♪

1421
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:35.620
(electricity sparking)

1422
00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:39.160
MATT: Dividing it in half, you can go all about the canopy

1423
00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.080
of the tree, and that should be sufficient daylight

1424
00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.890
to maintain the tree, and the other half

1425
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:44.500
of it you can take through the garden you're beginning

1426
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.890
to build within the stone top of the tower.

1427
00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:49.203
TALIESIN: Around all the stones, and put them in so--

1428
00:51:49.203 --> 00:51:51.430
LAURA: I think we should do

1429
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:53.360
a canopy of lights, you know what I mean,

1430
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.300
so it goes around the branches, down to, like--

1431
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.240
TALIESIN: Yeah, the hope is so we're not

1432
00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.710
putting light out, we're bringing light in.

1433
00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:01.343
This is all about keeping it in. We don't want to be--

1434
00:52:01.343 --> 00:52:02.650
ASHLEY: Oh, it's on the underside?

1435
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:04.420
MATT: This process takes about a week

1436
00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.850
for them to put all that together,

1437
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.930
and as you're doing it, the neighbors do come by

1438
00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:10.370
and look, and are confused, and then once they go up,

1439
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:14.399
the confusion and mistrust turns into awe and jealousy.

1440
00:52:14.399 --> 00:52:17.070
(laughter)

1441
00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:18.590
TALIESIN: I'm going to be making it very clear

1442
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:20.520
that I'm going to be making things that are edible,

1443
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.010
and that we are going to be sharing with the neighbors,

1444
00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:25.422
is another--
TRAVIS: It won't help.

1445
00:52:25.422 --> 00:52:27.088
TALIESIN: I know.

1446
00:52:27.088 --> 00:52:29.410
LIAM: On day two of this marathon,

1447
00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:33.370
Caleb transcribes Teleportation Circle into his spell book.

1448
00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.148
MARISHA: Oh my god, oh my god!

1449
00:52:35.148 --> 00:52:38.490
(laughter)

1450
00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:41.170
SAM: Where can you send something?

1451
00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:44.380
LIAM: I have to know where a sigil is.

1452
00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:45.820
SAM: And the only one we know is in--

1453
00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:46.950
LIAM: Is in Nicodranas.

1454
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:48.520
SAM: Okay, okay.

1455
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.215
LIAM: Well, and there's one here

1456
00:52:50.215 --> 00:52:51.287
as well, but we'll--

1457
00:52:51.287 --> 00:52:53.583
MATT: You've seen three, technically.

1458
00:52:53.583 --> 00:52:56.070
So by memory, you can remember all three.

1459
00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:58.020
You've sketched one down, which is the one

1460
00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:01.103
that you saw in Yussa's place, but there were two

1461
00:53:01.103 --> 00:53:04.640
that you passed by in Asarius and, when you arrived--

1462
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.820
LIAM: Jumped to, right.

1463
00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.120
LAURA: So we could jump to any of those.

1464
00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.790
LIAM: Asarius to the Empire.

1465
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.020
MATT:So those the three that you know are--

1466
00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:12.520
Yeah, you have none for the Empire.

1467
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.353
LIAM: I just misspoke--

1468
00:53:13.353 --> 00:53:14.730
MATT: Yeah, no worries, yeah, you have Nicodranas,

1469
00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:16.880
Asarius, and Rosohna. Those are the three that you know.

1470
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.380
LIAM: Just as long as I have them in here, I have them.

1471
00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.100
MATT: Correct, you can write them down in,

1472
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.510
for when the 30 days

1473
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:22.800
are up, so you don't forget.

1474
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.330
But I'd recommend that.

1475
00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:26.490
LIAM: Okay, it's done.
MATT: Okay.

1476
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:29.530
LIAM: 72 days of putting up Christmas lights, it's done.

1477
00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:30.363
MATT: Okay.

1478
00:53:30.363 --> 00:53:31.921
TRAVIS: I drop my shit in my room.

1479
00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:33.138
I get the wooden shutters up.

1480
00:53:33.138 --> 00:53:34.880
With the time that's left, can I

1481
00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.630
check out our neighbors? Are there any

1482
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:39.300
shops or fortune tellers,

1483
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.610
or anything strange in our immediate vicinity-- what?

1484
00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:44.950
TALIESIN: No, it's good. It's good to know if you live

1485
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:45.800
in a walkable neighborhood.

1486
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.980
TRAVIS: That's what I'm saying, it's important.

1487
00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:48.955
Is there sushi on my corner or not?

1488
00:53:48.955 --> 00:53:50.962
Pizza, what do we have?

1489
00:53:50.962 --> 00:53:54.330
TALIESIN: If you don't use them, it's how you lose them.

1490
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:56.260
MATT: All right.

1491
00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.373
So looking around the area, there are no

1492
00:53:59.373 --> 00:54:01.160
shopping districts in the Firmaments.

1493
00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.670
It tends to be mostly

1494
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.550
residential and religious.

1495
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:13.680
There are structures for places of worship for the Luxon.

1496
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:18.700
You do see a few shrines that look--

1497
00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.030
sitting out for other gods outside of Luxon,

1498
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.100
but they look largely in disuse,

1499
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.490
and just there as part of the decor.

1500
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:28.928
It's the equivalent of

1501
00:54:28.928 --> 00:54:30.940
seeing a giant crystal cathedral,

1502
00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:33.690
and then a couple of small, little installations

1503
00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:37.210
at a nearby park.

1504
00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.650
The places you do come across:

1505
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:41.380
there is the fine clothing establishment,

1506
00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.910
which is where you guys got your outfits

1507
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:46.750
designed when you first made those custom orders,

1508
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:52.260
and some of the places that did the

1509
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.250
repairs and changes to the house that you requested,

1510
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:57.410
such as your shutters, but most of the

1511
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:58.850
mainstream commerce,

1512
00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:00.420
depending on what you're looking for,

1513
00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.200
would be further in near the Gallimaufry,

1514
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.440
or out to the Coronas.

1515
00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.974
TRAVIS: Coming in out of the house, just the front door,

1516
00:55:06.974 --> 00:55:10.390
anybody watching us?

1517
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:12.580
Following, keeping an eye on the house?

1518
00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.500
MATT: Make a perception check.

1519
00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.630
TRAVIS: Seven.

1520
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:20.530
MATT: Best you can tell, I mean,

1521
00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:21.770
people are definitely paying attention.

1522
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:26.770
You're the new neighbors. The glimpses they get are of a

1523
00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:29.483
non-drow,

1524
00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:32.563
half-human

1525
00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:36.570
crew of people that just wandered into one

1526
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:40.330
of the richer districts of the city without introduction,

1527
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:42.460
and have raised a 60-foot tree covered

1528
00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.900
with Christmas lights. So yeah,

1529
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.830
there's a lot of eyes on your house.

1530
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:50.960
People walk by constantly, and

1531
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.150
when they don't think anyone's watching,

1532
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:53.210
look through the windows.

1533
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:55.070
So, you know, like--
LIAM: Frat house at Christmas.

1534
00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:57.540
MATT: Yeah, you guys, you guys are definitely a curiosity

1535
00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.373
in this neighborhood.

1536
00:55:58.373 --> 00:56:00.209
TRAVIS: Tune to 96.3 AM to--
(laughter)

1537
00:56:00.209 --> 00:56:01.510
(laughter)

1538
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:05.480
LIAM: We're just going to get some new clothes and blend in.

1539
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.130
MATT: Yeah, not so much.

1540
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:11.380
Yeah, the two neighboring buildings.

1541
00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:13.580
There's one very nice house.

1542
00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.160
A similar design, if a little bit larger than the one

1543
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.970
that you guys are in, to the right that nobody's home.

1544
00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:21.460
It looks like it's closed up and locked up.

1545
00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.060
The folks are not there, at least not there for now.

1546
00:56:25.175 --> 00:56:26.660
And definitely no tree.

1547
00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.690
The house to the left, which is equal in size,

1548
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:33.810
if not a little bit smaller, but very finely detailed.

1549
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:35.142
There is

1550
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.940
carved scrolling and lattice

1551
00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.670
in all the corners of the building's construction.

1552
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:43.240
A lot of work and time has gone into the

1553
00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.880
antique-like tiny details in the edges

1554
00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.820
of every joined piece of wood for the structure.

1555
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:56.155
There is a family there. There is

1556
00:56:56.155 --> 00:56:58.380
a drow diplomat and a historian.

1557
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:03.805
Him and his family, known as the Bilan family.

1558
00:57:03.805 --> 00:57:04.801
TRAVIS: Bilan.

1559
00:57:04.801 --> 00:57:06.690
MATT: You meet

1560
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:13.100
Lord Bilan. He is, well, a little more prominent in

1561
00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:16.320
the overall dynamic of the city.

1562
00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:21.450
He's interested to hear about you,

1563
00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:23.000
and what all you're doing here.

1564
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:25.730
Upon first meeting, he

1565
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:30.352
gives you a look over, and goes, "So

1566
00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.910
"if you could possibly tell me how, why are you,

1567
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.630
"why are you here?"

1568
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.353
TRAVIS: We are

1569
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.920
honored guests of the Bright Queen.

1570
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.230
We have traveled far to return an item

1571
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.850
of great importance, and it is important to her

1572
00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:53.300
and the Dynasty that we keep an eye on things.

1573
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:55.190
It's always good to have a third party,

1574
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:58.300
and make sure that your interests are looked after.

1575
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.900
MATT: "Very interesting, okay.

1576
00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:04.150
"And you are?"
TRAVIS: My name is Fjord.

1577
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.690
I feel like I should ask, do you belong

1578
00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:09.520
to a particular regarded

1579
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.150
den?

1580
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:13.440
MATT: "I do belong to one of the dens, yes."

1581
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.060
TRAVIS: Oh, I didn't mean to impose,

1582
00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.940
I just figured that might be a good thing

1583
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:21.240
to know about our neighbors.

1584
00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.140
MATT: "And now you do."

1585
00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.050
TRAVIS: Yep.

1586
00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:25.625
MATT: "If you require anything as

1587
00:58:25.625 --> 00:58:27.880
"friends of the Bright Queen,

1588
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.540
"ask and we'll see what we can do."

1589
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.215
TRAVIS: I appreciate that.

1590
00:58:32.215 --> 00:58:34.115
Likewise, if we make too much ruckus,

1591
00:58:34.115 --> 00:58:36.110
or if you see shit growing out of the top of our house,

1592
00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:39.345
you just come over and knock, okay?

1593
00:58:39.345 --> 00:58:40.990
MATT: (slow knocking)

1594
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:44.600
TRAVIS: Yeah, that, mm.

1595
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.750
Yeah, I walked into that. Anything else,

1596
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:51.070
you just let us know.

1597
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:52.620
MATT: "Will it be that all the time?"

1598
00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.578
TRAVIS: I think that's how trees work.

1599
00:58:55.578 --> 00:58:58.161
(laughter)

1600
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:02.410
MATT: "It's a pleasure to meet you, Fjord."

1601
00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:04.891
TRAVIS: It is nice to meet you, too, Lord Bi--

1602
00:59:04.891 --> 00:59:07.342
MATT: The doors close.

1603
00:59:07.342 --> 00:59:09.666
LIAM, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: (Drawn-out) Bye!

1604
00:59:09.666 --> 00:59:12.198
TRAVIS: ♪ All my friends-- ♪

1605
00:59:12.198 --> 00:59:15.039
LIAM: We have diplomatic immunity.

1606
00:59:15.039 --> 00:59:18.589
(laughter)

1607
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:23.840
MATT: Making a splash already, all right. (laughs)

1608
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.550
SAM: Matthew, if we have some time.

1609
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:26.383
MATT: Yes?

1610
00:59:26.383 --> 00:59:30.320
SAM: I would probably bother Jester a few times

1611
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.170
to use Sending, or send a message.

1612
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:34.060
LAURA: Of course, of course.

1613
00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:37.310
SAM: To Luc and/or Edith, who is watching Luc.

1614
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:39.180
LAURA: What do you want to me to say?

1615
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.800
SAM: How are you, are you alive, how's,

1616
00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:42.870
they're in Alfield, right?

1617
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:44.040
MATT: They're in Alfield, that's where he sent them, yeah.

1618
00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.530
SAM: How's Alfield?

1619
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:49.490
LAURA: I do that. How are you? Are you alive?

1620
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.640
Are you in Alfield still? How is Alfield?

1621
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.570
SAM: Yeah.

1622
00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:54.979
LAURA: Yeah?

1623
00:59:54.979 --> 00:59:57.727
SAM: Your dad and mom are together.

1624
00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:59.573
LAURA: Your dad and mom are together again,

1625
00:59:59.573 --> 01:00:02.420
they love you so much, they're so happy!

1626
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:06.160
MATT: Luc responses to the message, it's like,

1627
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.450
"Yeah, it's okay. It's been fine. It's a little boring.

1628
01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:12.967
"There's a lot of people coming in and out of town.

1629
01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:17.630
"There's a lot of, a lot of coast folk."

1630
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:19.030
LAURA: Coast folk?

1631
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.630
MATT: Edith responses to your...

1632
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:22.640
TALIESIN: 93 FM, The Coast.

1633
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.473
MATT: Yes, exactly.

1634
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.560
"Well, everything's been fine. We've been looking

1635
01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.030
"over your boy, and

1636
01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.700
"all this, this war business is just getting--

1637
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.720
"folks are just tense."

1638
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.290
LAURA: Folks are tense.

1639
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:39.930
SAM: Coast folk?

1640
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:43.600
LAURA: Yeah, oh, that reminds me. Matthew.

1641
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.433
MATT: Yes?

1642
01:00:44.433 --> 01:00:49.130
LAURA: Would I know what the gold mercenary--

1643
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.963
SAM: Oh, yeah.

1644
01:00:49.963 --> 01:00:50.920
MATT: Make a history check.

1645
01:00:51.944 --> 01:00:53.402
TRAVIS: The what?

1646
01:00:53.402 --> 01:00:54.688
SAM: Yeah, he mentioned, he mentioned this

1647
01:00:54.688 --> 01:00:56.900
last game, right?

1648
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.600
LAURA: Oh, come on!

1649
01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.340
MATT: As the epitome of super indoor kid,

1650
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:05.000
with that natural one, unfortunately, you do not have a lot

1651
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.160
of knowledge regarding some of the other smaller factions

1652
01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.300
that might be wandering the coast.

1653
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.740
LAURA: I'm going to go ask Fjord about it.

1654
01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:14.900
MATT: Okay.

1655
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.840
LAURA: Fjord, do you know anything about the gold--?

1656
01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.410
TRAVIS: Why do you have paint all over your forearm?

1657
01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:24.128
LAURA: I'm a painter, Fjord.

1658
01:01:24.128 --> 01:01:25.969
This is what happens when you paint.

1659
01:01:25.969 --> 01:01:27.467
TRAVIS: Okay.

1660
01:01:27.467 --> 01:01:30.170
LAURA: Do you know anything about the gold mercenary

1661
01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.490
guys?
(laughter)

1662
01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.130
TRAVIS: Gold mercenary guys?

1663
01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:36.580
LAURA: What was it? Did you write it down?

1664
01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.990
SAM: I did not. It was something like the gold shield,

1665
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.823
or something.

1666
01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:41.800
ASHLEY: The Gold Chain Mercenary--

1667
01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.860
LAURA: The Gold Chain Mercenaries!

1668
01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.500
Do you not know anything about them?

1669
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.900
They're from the coast.

1670
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.730
My mom mentioned that a lot of them are coming

1671
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:51.980
into Nicodranas because of the war and stuff.

1672
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:54.363
MATT: Make a history check.

1673
01:01:54.363 --> 01:01:56.310
TRAVIS: (elephant noise)

1674
01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:57.430
ASHLEY: Is that what they're called?

1675
01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:00.065
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was it. Gold Chain.

1676
01:02:00.065 --> 01:02:01.423
TRAVIS: (clicks) Natural 20.

1677
01:02:01.423 --> 01:02:03.514
(cheering)

1678
01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:06.243
MATT: So--

1679
01:02:06.243 --> 01:02:08.480
MARISHA: That was so good!

1680
01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.270
MATT: What first was a--

1681
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:12.908
okay, yeah.

1682
01:02:12.908 --> 01:02:15.700
(laughter)

1683
01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.970
TALIESIN: You dated one in high school.

1684
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:17.803
MATT: Yeah.

1685
01:02:17.803 --> 01:02:21.770
So what at first was a group of

1686
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.410
disgruntled Zhelezo that were hired by,

1687
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:27.640
or worked under the Clovis Concord,

1688
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.770
eventually managed to buy out their contracts,

1689
01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:37.090
and began to be a, essentially a bodyguard service

1690
01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:40.170
for more wealthy nobles, and folks

1691
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:41.720
that needed to travel through

1692
01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.390
pirate-infested waters.

1693
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:47.600
You've not had any personal encounters

1694
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.710
with them directly, but you've seen them.

1695
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:53.090
They usually have a signal notch,

1696
01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:56.350
the single thick gold chain, whether it's actual gold,

1697
01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:58.380
or if it's just plated to look like it, you're not sure.

1698
01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.690
But it usually involves a gold chain around the neck,

1699
01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:03.540
and a gold chain that dangles from the sword.

1700
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:06.450
They wrap it around the hilt

1701
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.010
that links to the pommel and dangles,

1702
01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:10.550
and that's their calling sign,

1703
01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:12.030
to be seen in public spaces.

1704
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:14.340
Usually when you see one, and if it's alone,

1705
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.160
they're for hire, if they're with somebody,

1706
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.450
stay the hell away. It's the general sign for it,

1707
01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:20.840
because they're on somebody's watch.

1708
01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:24.150
There's not, at least last you heard,

1709
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:26.430
not an insane amount,

1710
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:28.760
maybe a couple hundred across the entire coast,

1711
01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.730
but that, you know, is years ago.

1712
01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:34.250
And who knows, in the ways of war,

1713
01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:36.420
there could be more that have joined their band.

1714
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:41.420
However, they're expensive, and they're ruthless, and they--

1715
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:44.890
that's why when you see them, you stay away.

1716
01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:47.510
Those that can afford them usually have reasons

1717
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:50.840
for needing to pay for top-line mercenary work,

1718
01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.890
to keep watch on them, and as the tales say,

1719
01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.890
for every Gold Chain Mercenary that's felled in combat,

1720
01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:04.380
or by an assassin, there's 100 that he left

1721
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.580
in his wake before his days came to an end.

1722
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.080
They're pretty intense.

1723
01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.560
TRAVIS: Is it like a guild, or is there a top Gold Chain,

1724
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.500
like an elder chain?

1725
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.680
MATT: Well, Mr. Natural 20, which brings you

1726
01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.380
to a total of what, with your history?

1727
01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:22.920
TRAVIS: With history, it is a 22.

1728
01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.753
MATT: 22, okay.

1729
01:04:26.121 --> 01:04:28.630
You're not sure who's in charge of it currently.

1730
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:33.150
There was somebody in charge, but they were--

1731
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:36.240
they disappeared into Darktow about ten years before.

1732
01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.620
And since then, they haven't,

1733
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:46.150
they haven't formally announced a particular organizer,

1734
01:04:46.547 --> 01:04:48.880
whether that be because they don't have one,

1735
01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.970
or because it's too much of a target

1736
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:52.890
on one person's head, based on what may have happened

1737
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.550
to their previous leader, but they seem

1738
01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:58.050
to activate as an autonomous group,

1739
01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:00.971
and no one really knows how they communicate.

1740
01:05:00.971 --> 01:05:01.804
They tend to be pretty secretive

1741
01:05:01.804 --> 01:05:03.320
about their internal business, and those

1742
01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.480
that are sworn to become-- to join the team

1743
01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.960
are very much under a kind of secrecy

1744
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.800
of business type ordeal.

1745
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.320
TRAVIS: Jester, I'm glad you asked. "Blech",

1746
01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.440
and I give her all that.
MATT: All right, there you go.

1747
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:20.310
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1748
01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.820
So secretive, deadly, expensive.

1749
01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:26.200
LAURA: Wow, a lot of them are around my mama right now.

1750
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.900
TRAVIS: Well, that's good, that means she'll be safe, right?

1751
01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.080
Did she ever hire anyone?
LAURA: No.

1752
01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.750
She's never hired one or anything.

1753
01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.900
TRAVIS: I'm sure she's performed for them,

1754
01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:38.440
though, right? I mean, she's got to be beloved.

1755
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.480
LAURA: Well, I don't know. I mean,

1756
01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.430
I think I remember seeing Gold Chains and stuff

1757
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:48.270
when I was growing up, but I don't know for sure.

1758
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:55.600
Anyway, how are you doing here, Fjord?

1759
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.210
TRAVIS: Hey, no, I'm great. Do me a favor.

1760
01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:03.690
I do not require any color in this room. Just leave her be.

1761
01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:06.240
LAURA: I figured. I thought about making

1762
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.230
an ocean mural in here for you, but--

1763
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:10.280
TRAVIS: No, it's all right.

1764
01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:12.780
LAURA: You seem to be a little

1765
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:16.450
uncomfortable with the water right now.

1766
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:19.610
TRAVIS: Uncomfortable with the water?

1767
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.540
Haven't really been around much water.

1768
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.940
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean. We ran away from it.

1769
01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:28.740
TRAVIS: Who ran away? <i>We</i> ran away from it.

1770
01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.070
LAURA: That's what I said. <i>We</i> ran away.

1771
01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.360
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, okay, yeah.

1772
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.590
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

1773
01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:40.380
I've never been this far away from our neck of the woods.

1774
01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.940
LAURA: Yeah?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1775
01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:44.500
LAURA: This is, you know.

1776
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.200
I mean, I'm just guessing here,

1777
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.490
but have you ever had a house before?

1778
01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:52.040
TRAVIS: No.

1779
01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.590
LAURA: How do you feel in the house?

1780
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.720
TRAVIS: Well, my own room's pretty strange.

1781
01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.880
LAURA: Yeah.

1782
01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.680
TRAVIS: Yep.

1783
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.300
Take it a little bit at a time. I moved in,

1784
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.090
like, (snaps fingers) <i>tout suite</i>.

1785
01:07:08.485 --> 01:07:10.015
Yeah.

1786
01:07:10.873 --> 01:07:12.727
It's cool, I guess.

1787
01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.300
LAURA: You're right next door, so if you're lonely or

1788
01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:20.850
anything, you can just knock, or I can draw a little hole

1789
01:07:20.850 --> 01:07:21.880
in the wall.

1790
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.290
TRAVIS: Jester, there doesn't need to be any damn hole

1791
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.820
in the wall, all right. I don't know if you've heard,

1792
01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:31.249
but Beau snores like a son of a bitch. It's canon.

1793
01:07:31.249 --> 01:07:35.082
(laughter)

1794
01:07:35.082 --> 01:07:36.330
MARISHA: I'll allow it.
TALIESIN: It sounds like a

1795
01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:38.058
what? It sounds like a cannon?

1796
01:07:38.058 --> 01:07:41.480
TRAVIS: (snoring) Like the jaw's open and to the right.

1797
01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.801
It's never opened. It's like--

1798
01:07:42.801 --> 01:07:43.909
LAURA: I know, I room with her all the time.

1799
01:07:43.909 --> 01:07:45.900
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: I don't mind.

1800
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:50.589
TRAVIS: Yeah, I can't stand it. (clears throat)

1801
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:53.810
MARISHA: Glad I'm not rooming with you, then. You're missing

1802
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:54.910
out on my sick fucking abs.

1803
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:56.900
LAURA: I just wanted to make sure and stuff.

1804
01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.950
TRAVIS: Yeah, thanks.
LAURA: Yeah.

1805
01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.058
Okay.

1806
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.220
LIAM: All done?

1807
01:08:04.355 --> 01:08:06.160
I have a few people I need to corner.

1808
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.620
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Specifically.

1809
01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.930
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

1810
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:10.860
The first one is this one.
MATT: All right.

1811
01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.690
LIAM: So on one of our free days here,

1812
01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:15.150
while they're still hanging Xhorhas lights,

1813
01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:17.450
I catch you, bring you into the laboratory.

1814
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:18.750
SAM: Yes.
LIAM: Okay?

1815
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.350
This is for you. I got these for you.

1816
01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:21.350
SAM: Amazing!

1817
01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:22.790
LIAM: So they're at your disposal.

1818
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:24.710
SAM: I'm going to use it right now.

1819
01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:26.120
LIAM: What are you going to make?

1820
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:29.700
SAM: I've got a bonafide chemist with me right now.

1821
01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.790
MATT: He's over in the corner, like,

1822
01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:31.800
"I don't know if you noticed,

1823
01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.188
"but I've been here the whole time."

1824
01:08:33.188 --> 01:08:34.879
LIAM: That's fine. You're-- I don't mind--

1825
01:08:34.879 --> 01:08:37.485
MATT: "It's a nice setup. I get it at lot. It's fine."

1826
01:08:37.485 --> 01:08:39.350
SAM: We're going to make a bunch of shit.

1827
01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.680
LIAM: What's first?

1828
01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.080
MATT: "What do you want?"

1829
01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.540
SAM: I've got-- well,

1830
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.190
I'm going to have to get some more supplies.

1831
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:51.190
But I need-- if you could somehow make these crossbow bolts,

1832
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:52.870
like a flare.

1833
01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:55.643
MATT: "Interesting."

1834
01:08:55.643 --> 01:08:58.930
SAM: Like some sort of substance that would burn up slowly

1835
01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:01.710
and make a bright light as I fired it into the air.

1836
01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:02.750
MATT: "Yeah, we could totally do that.

1837
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:04.450
"We just need some sulfur,

1838
01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:08.010
"probably some bat guano."
SAM: He's very good.

1839
01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.520
MATT: "Some-- fashion a saltpeter-type substance."

1840
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:15.074
SAM: Wouldn't mind, wouldn't mind making a--

1841
01:09:15.074 --> 01:09:17.840
I heard about these little bags

1842
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.450
of things you throw down and it makes the ground all icky

1843
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:22.600
and sticky. It slows people down.

1844
01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.525
MATT: "We could try and work something

1845
01:09:23.525 --> 01:09:26.013
"like that out, maybe. Okay."

1846
01:09:26.013 --> 01:09:26.920
LIAM: You two are dangerous together.

1847
01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.650
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, and anything you want, too, Caleb.

1848
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:33.750
LIAM: I will get back to you on that, if that's all right.

1849
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.058
MATT: "I'm not going anywhere."

1850
01:09:35.058 --> 01:09:36.410
LIAM: Okay.

1851
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:38.180
SAM: Maybe even a smoke bomb or two.

1852
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.930
I don't know what we have time for.

1853
01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:41.980
MATT: "Let's give it a shot."
SAM: Yeah.

1854
01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.130
TALIESIN: What would Batman do?

1855
01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.580
LIAM: I did have a specific question for you.

1856
01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.155
Something that I've been putting off

1857
01:09:49.155 --> 01:09:52.510
for a while, because we had bigger things on our plate, but

1858
01:09:53.918 --> 01:09:56.218
a while back, you mentioned a specific letter.

1859
01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.590
SAM: Oh.

1860
01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:00.630
LIAM: That you wrote on

1861
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.880
my behalf, or...?

1862
01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.320
Tell me again, because I remember what you said,

1863
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.830
but I'm not sure I understand what you said.

1864
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:10.460
SAM: I felt extremely guilty. At the time

1865
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.370
I thought that I was being helpful,

1866
01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:15.880
trying to get you some sort of connection with your past.

1867
01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.590
But I didn't know that your past was--

1868
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:23.810
LIAM: Did you get the sense from my story

1869
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:26.900
that I had fond connections of that past?

1870
01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.517
SAM: Of her, yes.

1871
01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:33.778
LIAM: But what did you say?

1872
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.330
SAM: I didn't--

1873
01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:38.300
I wrote a letter,

1874
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.900
not even to the girl, Astrid,

1875
01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:47.590
but I think it was to her school, if I remember correctly.

1876
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:50.530
LIAM: From whom?

1877
01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:53.190
SAM: From an interested party that was unnamed.

1878
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.473
LIAM: Did you,

1879
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.610
did you name anything, list anything

1880
01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:01.070
that we have any connection to?

1881
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.450
SAM: I think I said something, and I could be wrong

1882
01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:06.330
about this, if only I had your keen memory.

1883
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.642
Jester, get in here!
LAURA: Hmm?

1884
01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:15.090
SAM: Oi, oi, Jester, why is there paint all over you?

1885
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.531
LAURA: I'm making some modifications. What is it?

1886
01:11:19.531 --> 01:11:20.748
SAM: You helped me with this.

1887
01:11:20.748 --> 01:11:22.056
You helped me write this letter

1888
01:11:22.056 --> 01:11:23.247
to Astrid.
LAURA: What are you talking about?

1889
01:11:23.247 --> 01:11:25.390
SAM: There was an Astrid. We wrote a letter to Astrid.

1890
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:26.590
LAURA: What are you talking about?

1891
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:29.700
SAM: Remember? This was a while back. We were in Zadash,

1892
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.283
I want to say?
LIAM: One moment.

1893
01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.850
You have explained Astrid

1894
01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:39.053
to Jester?

1895
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.670
LAURA: You talked to me about Astrid.

1896
01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.450
LIAM: (weakly) Some.

1897
01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:47.220
LAURA: Yeah.

1898
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.520
SAM: I just--
LIAM: You didn't--

1899
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:51.030
she didn't say--
SAM: Was it a secret?

1900
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:52.970
LAURA: -- who Astrid was.

1901
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:54.680
She just said

1902
01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:55.580
Astrid,

1903
01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:58.820
and I just wrote it. If you--

1904
01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:00.920
if there's something I'm not supposed to know or something--

1905
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.440
SAM: I didn't know it was such a secret--

1906
01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.670
LAURA: But you said the name.
SAM: I thought she was

1907
01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:07.061
an old friend of yours from when you were a student.

1908
01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:08.200
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

1909
01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.750
LAURA: You seemed like you liked her a lot, Caleb.

1910
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:12.400
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: That's all.

1911
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.930
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

1912
01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:14.763
SAM: I just inquired

1913
01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:17.250
about her whereabouts as an interested party.

1914
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:20.350
I think we said something about being relatives,

1915
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:22.630
needing to contact her for some sort of--

1916
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:24.340
LAURA: Yes, yes, we said that we were going to offer her a

1917
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.370
lot of money or something, right?

1918
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:26.800
SAM: I think it was an inheritance

1919
01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.510
that we had to find for her.
LAURA: That's right.

1920
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:29.580
So we didn't say anything about--

1921
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.200
LIAM: What about a return address, or?

1922
01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.890
SAM: I believe this was at the Pillow Trove?

1923
01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:36.340
LAURA: Yes, it was at the Pillow-- you know,

1924
01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.040
we should really go back to Zadash.

1925
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.970
SAM: I think we said if you have any information,

1926
01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:42.000
send it to the Pillow Trove.
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh!

1927
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.110
You know what I'm going to do?

1928
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.943
SAM: What?

1929
01:12:44.943 --> 01:12:46.730
LAURA: I'm going to Send a message to the owner

1930
01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:47.730
of the Pillow Trove.

1931
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.490
MATT: Okay.

1932
01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:53.280
LAURA: Hi, it's me, Jester Lavore. I used to stay there.

1933
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.000
Have there been any letters or packages for me?

1934
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.120
SAM: I was blue.

1935
01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.753
LAURA: I was blue.
(laughter)

1936
01:13:00.753 --> 01:13:02.453
MATT: There's a, there's a mild pause.

1937
01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:09.580
"Oh, I-- Yes, I recall.

1938
01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:13.785
"There is a package here, yes."

1939
01:13:15.441 --> 01:13:17.390
(laughter)

1940
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:19.080
SAM: Fuck.
(laughter)

1941
01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.819
LAURA: I cast it again.
MATT: (laughs)

1942
01:13:21.819 --> 01:13:23.490
LAURA: Who's the fucking package from, then?

1943
01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:24.390
SAM: Open it. What's in it?

1944
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:27.830
LAURA: Open it up. What is in it? Tell me about it.

1945
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:30.300
MATT: "We are not allowed to open packages,

1946
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:35.010
"just to deliver them, as is required by senders.

1947
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:37.888
"From a Calianna."

1948
01:13:39.089 --> 01:13:40.460
SAM: What is that? What is that?

1949
01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:43.870
LAURA: Oh, it's our-- my pen pal. Our pen pal.

1950
01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:44.703
SAM: Oh, that's right.

1951
01:13:44.703 --> 01:13:46.347
LAURA: Calianna sent us a package?

1952
01:13:47.679 --> 01:13:50.470
Oh, we have to go back to Zadash.

1953
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.580
What if it was baked goods or something?

1954
01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.900
I bet they're really gross now.

1955
01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.990
MATT: "There is also a letter, it seems."

1956
01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.540
LAURA: There's a letter. There's a letter.

1957
01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:04.310
SAM: Ask if there's-- use your fucking spell again.

1958
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:05.143
LAURA: Okay, I send--

1959
01:14:05.143 --> 01:14:07.290
TALIESIN: Don't you need that stone-- nevermind.

1960
01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:10.900
LAURA: I Send another message. Who's the letter from?

1961
01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:14.488
Is it for, is--

1962
01:14:14.488 --> 01:14:15.940
SAM: Open it.
LAURA: Open it up.

1963
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.760
SAM: You have my permission.
LAURA: You have my permission.

1964
01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.220
MATT: "I would require the permission in person

1965
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:26.220
"to open the letter. It is from the Soltryce Academy."

1966
01:14:26.338 --> 01:14:29.390
(gasping)

1967
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:31.660
MATT: "It seems official."
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

1968
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.248
LAURA: It's from the Soltryce Academy. It seems official.

1969
01:14:35.248 --> 01:14:37.989
TRAVIS: (sings the Terminator 2 theme)

1970
01:14:37.989 --> 01:14:39.190
SAM: We'll never go back to Zadash--

1971
01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:40.480
TALIESIN: Have you seen this wizard?

1972
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.580
SAM: We'll never go back to Zadash, and if we do--

1973
01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.755
LAURA: No, we have to go back,

1974
01:14:44.755 --> 01:14:46.055
because that's where my dad is.

1975
01:14:46.055 --> 01:14:49.960
SAM: We'll kill the owner. Burn down her establishment,

1976
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.350
and no one will ever know that we were ever there,

1977
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:54.046
or that it exists.

1978
01:14:56.438 --> 01:15:00.520
LIAM: Did you make any, any mention of any of us,

1979
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.740
of anyone you know--

1980
01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:04.910
LAURA: I think we said our name was Nott--

1981
01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:10.600
we said our, that Nott and Lavore, lawyer--

1982
01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.140
SAM: Oh, we did.
LAURA: We put our name on it.

1983
01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.740
LIAM: You used-- you used the name Lavore?

1984
01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:19.680
LAURA: Maybe not, maybe I didn't. Maybe it was just Nott.

1985
01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.230
LIAM: But did you maybe?
SAM: I think maybe we did.

1986
01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:24.213
LAURA: I think maybe we did.

1987
01:15:24.213 --> 01:15:26.950
It might have been Nott the Brave,

1988
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:29.240
or-- no, that's probably not what we said.

1989
01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.120
SAM: It was like Lavore and Company,

1990
01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.860
Attorneys at Law, or something.

1991
01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.250
LIAM: Let me elaborate a little bit, Jester,

1992
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:39.530
Nott knows some of this, but

1993
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:40.363
Astrid

1994
01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.110
and other people that I used to know wouldn't-- would

1995
01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:50.840
not take kindly to finding me,

1996
01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:57.060
and I worry about any openings that we have made for them.

1997
01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:00.490
Now, that is mitigated somewhat by the concept

1998
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:04.790
that we have revealed ourselves to hidden eyes

1999
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:08.220
in front of the Empress, but I--

2000
01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:10.580
I worry slightly about your mother,

2001
01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.080
maybe.

2002
01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:18.085
If you used that name, maybe.

2003
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:22.020
TRAVIS: Ms. Lavore of Nott and Brave firm.

2004
01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:22.853
LAURA: Oh, no.

2005
01:16:22.853 --> 01:16:26.920
LIAM: Your mother is famous.

2006
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.555
LAURA: She is.
LIAM: Yeah.

2007
01:16:34.324 --> 01:16:35.530
I don't know.

2008
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:37.500
LAURA: Do you think they're going to hurt her?

2009
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.740
LIAM: Have you spoken to her recently?

2010
01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:43.910
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, I speak to her almost every night.

2011
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:49.140
Every other night-- I go a little long sometimes,

2012
01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.300
and I should call my mama more, honestly.

2013
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:56.020
But I did talk to her very recently.

2014
01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.306
LIAM: I want to help you see her,

2015
01:16:58.306 --> 01:17:00.531
but we should be very careful.

2016
01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:05.620
LAURA: Okay, but you can take us to Nicodranas

2017
01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.020
whenever we need to go.

2018
01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:10.690
LIAM: Now, yes.

2019
01:17:10.690 --> 01:17:13.580
But it's just one layer of complication.

2020
01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.943
Maybe.

2021
01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.410
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: I'm sorry.

2022
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.895
I just wanted to you to have a friend.

2023
01:17:25.411 --> 01:17:27.570
LIAM: I have friends.
SAM: Well, you didn't then.

2024
01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:29.984
LAURA: Yeah, at the time, it was really touch and go.

2025
01:17:29.984 --> 01:17:31.284
SAM: You're really standoffish, and--

2026
01:17:31.284 --> 01:17:33.093
(laughter)

2027
01:17:33.093 --> 01:17:34.443
This was a while back.

2028
01:17:34.443 --> 01:17:36.227
LAURA: I think this was right after you did the mud

2029
01:17:36.227 --> 01:17:40.080
on your face thing, and it was-- I felt really guilty.

2030
01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.110
LIAM: Yeah, it's as much my fault as anyone's.

2031
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:43.500
SAM: No, no, no, no, don't blame yourself,

2032
01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.370
it's our fault--

2033
01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:46.640
LAURA: It's definitely Nott's fault.

2034
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.740
SAM: Well, I mean, you were there, too,

2035
01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:48.880
you could have stopped me,

2036
01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.370
you could have stopped me at any moment.

2037
01:17:50.370 --> 01:17:52.190
LAURA: I didn't know what I was doing, so.

2038
01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:54.210
SAM: Well, neither did I, you think I know what I'm doing?

2039
01:17:54.210 --> 01:17:57.250
LAURA: I'm super--

2040
01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:59.091
LIAM: It's really all right.

2041
01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:01.467
I think the time

2042
01:18:01.467 --> 01:18:03.510
when someone comes to find

2043
01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:07.150
me is inevitable at this point,

2044
01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:10.270
but that is possibly one point of entry, so.

2045
01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:16.023
LAURA: So, but do you like Astrid?

2046
01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.573
LIAM: I did, yeah.

2047
01:18:21.147 --> 01:18:21.980
Yeah.

2048
01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.438
SAM: Maybe she'll just want to hang out

2049
01:18:23.438 --> 01:18:24.757
and be friends again.

2050
01:18:24.757 --> 01:18:26.900
LAURA: Yeah.

2051
01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:30.000
LIAM: I don't know, for a while, she was the one,

2052
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.517
but that was a long time ago.

2053
01:18:35.489 --> 01:18:36.612
Okay.

2054
01:18:37.787 --> 01:18:40.230
Stumbling away from that one.

2055
01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.590
TRAVIS: That's the only corner you had to--

2056
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:45.981
LIAM: No way, so much as I've been waiting on--

2057
01:18:45.981 --> 01:18:47.865
(knocking)

2058
01:18:47.865 --> 01:18:49.156
MARISHA: Gah.

2059
01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:51.970
Just hang on.

2060
01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:53.403
LIAM: Stop snoring and open the door.

2061
01:18:53.403 --> 01:18:56.150
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs)

2062
01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:58.370
MARISHA: I was napping, you bitch.

2063
01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.212
Yeah.

2064
01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:06.580
LIAM: When are you intending to get in touch with Dairon?

2065
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:08.720
SAM: Oh, yeah.

2066
01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.453
LIAM: Because I don't think we should free ball this

2067
01:19:10.453 --> 01:19:13.720
any longer, I think we need to bring her in, and I was--

2068
01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.780
MARISHA: I just slowly close the door on Caleb.

2069
01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.450
LIAM: I'm going to talk to you through the door,

2070
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:19.490
and everyone will hear me, or you can let me in,

2071
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:21.340
because this is important--
MARISHA: I open the fucking door.

2072
01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.060
LIAM: May I come in?

2073
01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.107
MARISHA: Yeah.

2074
01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:36.470
LIAM: We-- we need to have some sort of plan, Beauregard.

2075
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:38.520
MARISHA: Why, with her? Why?

2076
01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.050
LIAM: With her, who?
MARISHA: Dairon.

2077
01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:41.570
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Why?

2078
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:43.450
LIAM: Because we have just made an allegiance

2079
01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:46.074
with the leaders of a foreign power.

2080
01:19:46.074 --> 01:19:47.260
MARISHA: Yeah.

2081
01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.420
She does not want you cavorting with them,

2082
01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.811
but we are, for a purpose.

2083
01:19:52.761 --> 01:19:54.852
I want the Cerberus Assembly

2084
01:19:54.852 --> 01:19:59.590
to burn, but the Dynasty is not going to stop if they do,

2085
01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:01.320
and we need something to fill that vacuum,

2086
01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.270
if we have even a chance of doing that.

2087
01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.359
Are Dairon and your Cobalt Soul willing to fill that vacuum

2088
01:20:09.359 --> 01:20:12.900
to keep the Empire going if we rip the cancer out,

2089
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.720
as we have spoken of?

2090
01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:18.300
What are we doing? I mean, I have ideas, but--

2091
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.750
MARISHA: I have been

2092
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:22.440
going to sleep every night trying to figure that out.

2093
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.940
I don't know what we're doing.

2094
01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:28.640
I'm an initiate,

2095
01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:30.733
I'm--

2096
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:35.362
more or less in training to be an Expositor.

2097
01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.965
LIAM: I think you may have graduated ahead of time,

2098
01:20:39.965 --> 01:20:42.281
Beauregard.
MARISHA: Yeah, I think so, too.

2099
01:20:44.038 --> 01:20:49.038
I don't know if Dairon would hug me or kill me if she knew

2100
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:53.140
what was happening, and I can continue to spin it.

2101
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:57.570
I can do that, I can continue to spin it,

2102
01:20:57.570 --> 01:21:00.490
and let her think that we're continuing

2103
01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.520
to walk the line here, and continue to report.

2104
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:09.870
But everything that I report is going to have

2105
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:13.800
to be cherry picked and strategic,

2106
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.300
and the more information I give up,

2107
01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.130
the more I can jeopardize everything we're doing.

2108
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:23.290
LIAM: But neither of us are traitors to the Empire.

2109
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.065
MARISHA: Not yet.

2110
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:29.988
LIAM: You and I know what we are doing.

2111
01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:33.960
And Dairon can give us legitimacy.

2112
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:38.180
MARISHA: We just--

2113
01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:41.270
We did hand over their super awesome relic

2114
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:44.300
that can change time, or make babies,

2115
01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.420
or whatever, that the Empire definitely stole.

2116
01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:49.500
And now we have a house that was just kind of gifted

2117
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.870
to us in the capital enemy city.

2118
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:53.840
But you're right, we're not traitors yet.

2119
01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.120
LIAM: We have also moved one inch closer

2120
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:01.740
to healing a wound, and there are many, many,

2121
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.418
many steps left.

2122
01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.990
You're here to root out corruption.

2123
01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:11.160
In our home, you want to root out corruption,

2124
01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.670
Dairon wants to root out corruption.

2125
01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:16.430
My whole childhood is mired in it,

2126
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:21.020
and maybe we work one side, and get what we want

2127
01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:21.853
on the other.

2128
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:26.720
But I don't think we can just run roughshod over the Empire,

2129
01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.200
and do whatever we want, we are going to get killed.

2130
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.610
MARISHA: We also might get killed here,

2131
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:34.100
we are humans in a very unwanted territory.

2132
01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:40.360
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, we are gambling, to be sure.

2133
01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.410
MARISHA: I think every day is going to be a gamble.

2134
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:43.400
LIAM: Well, so what do you want to do?

2135
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.970
Do you want to keep Dairon on the outside of this,

2136
01:22:45.970 --> 01:22:46.830
or bring her in?

2137
01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:50.850
Think about it, you don't have to answer me now,

2138
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:53.720
but think about it.

2139
01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.336
MARISHA: I would like to talk to her

2140
01:22:55.336 --> 01:22:57.519
before we run into each other,

2141
01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:01.060
because you know how awkward that is when

2142
01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.670
you left it with things hanging,

2143
01:23:05.670 --> 01:23:07.430
and then you run into each other, and you're like,

2144
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:09.570
oh, I meant to call, I swear.

2145
01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:13.090
Sorry I didn't message you back.

2146
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:16.230
So I don't want that that to happen.

2147
01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.200
LIAM: That's all my conversations.

2148
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:24.010
MARISHA: Hey.
LIAM: Think about it.

2149
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:25.800
Think about it.
MARISHA: I have a question.

2150
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:29.510
It's totally unrelated, I just want to know.

2151
01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:31.870
Are you in love with Nott?

2152
01:23:32.905 --> 01:23:35.488
(Laura laughs)

2153
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:38.619
LIAM: No.

2154
01:23:38.619 --> 01:23:40.840
MARISHA: Are you sure?

2155
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:41.673
LIAM: Very sure.

2156
01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:46.800
MARISHA: All right.

2157
01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.928
Because, man, that tension.

2158
01:23:52.011 --> 01:23:53.767
LAURA: (quietly) Insight check.

2159
01:23:53.767 --> 01:23:54.800
TALIESIN: (pigeon coos)

2160
01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.633
Sorry.

2161
01:23:56.950 --> 01:24:00.490
MARISHA: I don't need an insight check, I know.

2162
01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:02.520
LIAM: Okay, well--
MARISHA: I'm just saying, it got,

2163
01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:06.160
there was (clicks) some vibes kicking,

2164
01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.340
or some pheromones going on when we were

2165
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:09.750
on that moorbounder.

2166
01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.700
LIAM: You are tuned into a specific frequency

2167
01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.620
that is not my frequency.

2168
01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:22.120
So this is not a good conversation.

2169
01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.920
Thank you, think about that, please.

2170
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:27.280
MARISHA: As I close the door, I just whisper to myself,

2171
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.956
I knew that would get him out of my fucking room.

2172
01:24:29.956 --> 01:24:31.387
MATT: (laughs)

2173
01:24:32.779 --> 01:24:35.208
TALIESIN: (snorts and laughs)

2174
01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:38.430
LIAM: Last thing, and I'll just shut up for an hour.

2175
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:42.680
When this guy is out to shop or look around,

2176
01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.350
I'm going to go sit and wait in his room,

2177
01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:45.880
and wait up for him to come back.

2178
01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.570
TRAVIS: Oh, motherfucker.
MATT: Okay.

2179
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:51.290
LAURA: When he's doing that, me and Caduceus

2180
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:54.269
are turning this area--
SAM: No, no.

2181
01:24:54.269 --> 01:24:57.080
(laughter)

2182
01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.904
LAURA: Into a spa.
TALIESIN: Into a hot tub.

2183
01:24:58.904 --> 01:25:00.161
We figured out how to set it up.

2184
01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:01.743
LAURA: We learned how to do it, we're going to do it.

2185
01:25:01.743 --> 01:25:03.036
LIAM: Did you say spa pub?

2186
01:25:03.036 --> 01:25:04.910
TALIESIN: We're making a hot tub.

2187
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:06.330
MATT: With stone shape?
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

2188
01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:07.230
LAURA: With stone shape and create water.

2189
01:25:07.230 --> 01:25:09.938
TALIESIN: And very easy to just make a little heater--

2190
01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.498
MATT: That's very easy to do, actually.

2191
01:25:11.498 --> 01:25:12.655
Well, heater--

2192
01:25:12.655 --> 01:25:14.727
LAURA: For underneath it, we're going to make,

2193
01:25:14.727 --> 01:25:16.900
like, a pizza oven sort of--
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2194
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:18.310
So you just have a thing so that the water--

2195
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:20.380
LIAM: Just have a thing so that I can throw a fire bolt

2196
01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:21.890
in the bottom.

2197
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:23.220
MATT: I will say the--

2198
01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:25.400
Okay, all right.

2199
01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:27.813
Okay.

2200
01:25:27.813 --> 01:25:31.363
(laughter)

2201
01:25:31.363 --> 01:25:32.370
TRAVIS: "Okay."
MATT: Okay.

2202
01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:33.203
TALIESIN: Create and Destroy Water

2203
01:25:33.203 --> 01:25:34.398
would be very helpful here.

2204
01:25:34.398 --> 01:25:36.648
MATT: No, it would be. Okay.

2205
01:25:36.648 --> 01:25:38.370
One thing to note, too,

2206
01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:41.120
the central portion of that tower,

2207
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.240
the roots are growing through the stone.

2208
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.850
LAURA: Oh, even better.
TALIESIN: It's gorgeous.

2209
01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:46.070
MATT: The spa's on the bottom floor,

2210
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:48.130
but I'm just letting you know, on the halfway up--

2211
01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:50.820
the actual roof above, where the tree

2212
01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:51.840
connects with them underneath,

2213
01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.300
there is about a foot and a half of just dozens

2214
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.390
and dozens of thick roots that are all dangling,

2215
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:57.880
through, that are pushed through the stone.

2216
01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.020
TALIESIN: Perfect.

2217
01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.336
MATT: And you build the spa, yeah, you have a spa.

2218
01:26:03.336 --> 01:26:04.844
Yay 5th level spells.

2219
01:26:04.844 --> 01:26:06.250
(laughter)

2220
01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:09.520
First level spells, proper use of magic, all right.

2221
01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.170
TALIESIN: This is where I, this is how I'm getting rid

2222
01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:13.230
of my frustration, that I can't easily figure out

2223
01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:16.130
what the hell that sword is, so I need a soak.

2224
01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.180
I just need a soak to relieve the tension.

2225
01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:19.013
MATT: There you go.

2226
01:26:19.013 --> 01:26:20.620
SAM: Have you just tried putting the pieces back together?

2227
01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:21.670
TALIESIN: Not yet, no.

2228
01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.890
TRAVIS: Like that would do it.

2229
01:26:23.890 --> 01:26:25.170
SAM: It may be magic.

2230
01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.509
LAURA: No, he needs to go north to the elves.

2231
01:26:28.509 --> 01:26:30.010
SAM: All right.

2232
01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:31.592
TRAVIS: Elves and the dwarves.

2233
01:26:31.592 --> 01:26:34.926
MATT: Okay, so you guys take the-- it takes most

2234
01:26:34.926 --> 01:26:37.870
of the time waiting for you to even--

2235
01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:40.503
to create the lights.

2236
01:26:40.503 --> 01:26:43.278
It doesn't take you too long to make the spa.

2237
01:26:43.278 --> 01:26:44.430
Between that and the painting,

2238
01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:46.670
you guys are done with the events until it comes

2239
01:26:46.670 --> 01:26:50.010
to the time that you're expecting.

2240
01:26:50.010 --> 01:26:51.180
All right, you had something, Nott?

2241
01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.610
TALIESIN: Worth it.

2242
01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:55.620
SAM: No, I was just going to chemistry that stuff.

2243
01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:59.800
MATT: Okay, because you have Yeza helping you, I will say

2244
01:27:00.670 --> 01:27:02.310
it is

2245
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:05.850
intelligence-based, so an intelligence modifier,

2246
01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:09.020
with your proficiency modifier, with advantage,

2247
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:11.080
and an additional, I'll say plus two on top of that,

2248
01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.140
just for having Yeza's help.

2249
01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:13.973
SAM: Okay.

2250
01:27:13.973 --> 01:27:15.220
MATT: So your proficiency modifier is plus--

2251
01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:16.053
SAM: Four.
MATT: Four?

2252
01:27:16.053 --> 01:27:17.260
SAM: Intelligence, three.

2253
01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.490
MATT: Seven plus two, it's plus nine

2254
01:27:18.490 --> 01:27:19.710
that these rolls with advantage,

2255
01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:21.210
so what do you want to create?

2256
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:25.200
SAM: Some sort of flare or tracer bolt.

2257
01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.490
MATT: How many do you want to make?

2258
01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:27.410
SAM: Three.

2259
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:30.880
MATT: Three. I would say it would be

2260
01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.580
ten gold worth of materials per bolt,

2261
01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.070
so 30 gold to create the three.

2262
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:35.068
SAM: Okay.

2263
01:27:35.068 --> 01:27:36.310
MATT: Go ahead and make some rolls for me,

2264
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:38.010
first one with advantage.

2265
01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:39.340
SAM: That's cocked.

2266
01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.710
15 plus all those numbers.

2267
01:27:43.710 --> 01:27:46.130
MATT: 24, that's with advantage?
SAM: Yep.

2268
01:27:46.130 --> 01:27:48.280
MATT: Yep, so not a problem with creating that.

2269
01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.160
SAM: 13, plus all those numbers.

2270
01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.200
MATT: All right, and the last one?

2271
01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.320
SAM: 10, plus all those numbers.
MATT: 19.

2272
01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.670
Okay, yeah, so you make three flare bolts.

2273
01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:01.440
SAM: Oh, cool.

2274
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.540
MATT: Essentially what you do is, they have a fuse

2275
01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.240
to the back of it, you ignite the fuse,

2276
01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.002
and then fire upward, and it burns it off as it arcs upward,

2277
01:28:10.002 --> 01:28:13.630
and it burns off by the time it hits the end

2278
01:28:13.630 --> 01:28:15.450
of your range on the bolt.
SAM: Okay.

2279
01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:17.030
MATT: So the long range point.
SAM: Like 120?

2280
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.880
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Cool.

2281
01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.200
MATT: But it burns along the path.

2282
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:24.200
SAM: One tangle foot bag, and one smoke bomb of some sort.

2283
01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:27.243
MATT: Tangle foot bag-- the materials there,

2284
01:28:27.243 --> 01:28:29.480
technically they don't have them in here,

2285
01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:32.270
so we'll be mixing it up as we go.

2286
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:35.510
That will act as, loosely

2287
01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:38.480
an entangle spell.
SAM: Okay.

2288
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:42.380
MATT: With a smaller ten foot radius, as opposed to a--

2289
01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.213
SAM: Okay.

2290
01:28:43.213 --> 01:28:45.820
MATT: Or-- I'm sorry, yeah, I'll say ten foot radius,

2291
01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:46.937
why not, sure.

2292
01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.410
With a DC of 12, so write that down, a DC of 12,

2293
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:53.640
ten foot radius.
SAM: Great.

2294
01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.470
MATT: So to create one of those, I'll say 50 gold,

2295
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:59.950
with the materials.

2296
01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:01.330
SAM: Oof, okay.

2297
01:29:01.330 --> 01:29:04.440
TALIESIN: Welcome to my world.

2298
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.990
SAM: With advantage, still?
MATT: Yep.

2299
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:07.170
SAM: 14 plus a bunch.

2300
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:08.930
MATT: Plus nine, okay, yeah, DC was 20 on that,

2301
01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:10.930
so you have one of those.
SAM: Okay, great.

2302
01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:14.090
MATT: And a smoke bomb?

2303
01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.510
I'll say five gold of materials, it's not too much.

2304
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:19.770
SAM: Okay, yeah.

2305
01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:21.500
MATT: So go ahead and try.

2306
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.498
SAM: 16.
MATT: 16?

2307
01:29:23.498 --> 01:29:25.210
Yeah, totally.
SAM: Great.

2308
01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:26.260
MATT: That's 25.
SAM: All right.

2309
01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.980
MATT: So the smoke bomb is an action to use,

2310
01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:31.340
and until the end of your next round,

2311
01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.080
in a five foot radius around you,

2312
01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.150
you have-- it is heavily obscured.

2313
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:41.420
SAM: Okay, just five foot radius, okay,

2314
01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:42.580
like, five foot on each, both sides?

2315
01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:44.450
MATT: On each, on each side, yeah, so as you throw it down,

2316
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:46.630
and then that area right there becomes heavily obscured.

2317
01:29:46.630 --> 01:29:48.180
TALIESIN: Where did Batman go?

2318
01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:49.290
MATT: Yeah, essentially.

2319
01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:52.180
SAM: I'm just going to enjoy making all of these things

2320
01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:55.040
over the hours with Yeza, helping him,

2321
01:29:55.040 --> 01:30:00.040
watching his deft, nimble hands dance across the chemicals.

2322
01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.680
MATT: Though you have a few things, as well,

2323
01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.790
to surprise him with, and the two of you together,

2324
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:07.250
it's less-- you notice in the time

2325
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:09.320
that you've spent working on your own chemicals,

2326
01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:12.970
and your adventuring, the dynamic becomes less of

2327
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.390
chemist and assistant, and more partners.

2328
01:30:18.549 --> 01:30:19.490
LAURA: Aww.

2329
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:21.150
SAM: And can I try one more thing?

2330
01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:22.520
MATT: Sure.

2331
01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:26.370
SAM: Like a more controlled, contained fluffernutter?

2332
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:31.078
Still not-- no fuse or anything,

2333
01:30:31.078 --> 01:30:33.570
just something I can throw,

2334
01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:36.472
and someone else will blow it up, maybe.

2335
01:30:37.403 --> 01:30:39.220
Or you can throw it, and I can blow it up.

2336
01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:41.620
MATT: Okay, I will consider it the same as

2337
01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.870
blasting powder or a stick of dynamite.

2338
01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.520
I'll say that'll be 50 gold to try and create.

2339
01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:49.820
LAURA: That's so much.

2340
01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.760
SAM: Jeez louise, it's worth it.

2341
01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:53.593
MATT: Well, I--.

2342
01:30:53.593 --> 01:30:56.000
SAM: Yeah, no, it's fine, I'll take it, I'll take it.

2343
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.520
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and check one thing.

2344
01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.212
SAM: I don't need this gold to, you know,

2345
01:30:59.212 --> 01:31:00.879
save my child or anything. It's fine.

2346
01:31:00.879 --> 01:31:03.460
MATT: That might actually--

2347
01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:06.710
MARISHA: Just buy his way into college.

2348
01:31:07.643 --> 01:31:08.980
TRAVIS: Oh.
LIAM: Oh.

2349
01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:09.813
TRAVIS: Oh.

2350
01:31:09.813 --> 01:31:12.910
SAM: Hey, I was a superstar on the lacrosse team,

2351
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:15.500
according to my pictures.
(laughter)

2352
01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.810
And resume.

2353
01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:18.135
TRAVIS: That's believable.

2354
01:31:19.089 --> 01:31:19.922
MATT: You go to--

2355
01:31:19.922 --> 01:31:21.272
ASHLEY: I just thought that you played soccer.

2356
01:31:21.272 --> 01:31:24.320
SAM: Yeah, I was really good.
LIAM: So yoked.

2357
01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:26.540
TRAVIS: What position did you play?

2358
01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:27.780
LIAM: Foot guy.
ASHLEY: Quarterback.

2359
01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.631
LAURA: Kicker, the kicker.
SAM: The catcher.

2360
01:31:29.631 --> 01:31:31.662
TRAVIS: Kicker?
TALIESIN: The kickoff return.

2361
01:31:32.641 --> 01:31:34.066
TRAVIS: I hate all of you.

2362
01:31:34.066 --> 01:31:36.540
SAM: Does anyone else need any chemistry shit?

2363
01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:38.880
TALIESIN: Just a little help setting up the spa.

2364
01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.290
LAURA: Oh, I need you to look at my hair foil.

2365
01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:44.243
LIAM: Hair what?

2366
01:31:44.243 --> 01:31:45.201
TRAVIS: Foil?

2367
01:31:45.201 --> 01:31:46.310
TALIESIN: Oh, that.

2368
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:48.000
LIAM: Do you have a goiter?

2369
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.590
TALIESIN: She bought some stuff.

2370
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:51.423
LIAM: Okay.

2371
01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:52.256
SAM: We can look at the hair oil.

2372
01:31:52.256 --> 01:31:53.530
LIAM: Oh, hair oil.
LAURA: Yeah, let me know,

2373
01:31:53.530 --> 01:31:55.630
and make sure it's not gross or something.

2374
01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.460
MATT: (inaudible)

2375
01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:02.070
SAM: Matt is taking this fluffernutter very seriously.

2376
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:05.980
MATT: I would way, sorry, it's--

2377
01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:07.520
It would be, it would be 50 gold to purchase.

2378
01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:08.710
I'm going to say, for materials, though,

2379
01:32:08.710 --> 01:32:11.550
because you're making it, 25.
SAM: Okay.

2380
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:13.260
Just saved some money.

2381
01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:16.820
TALIESIN: Discount.
SAM: Fluffernutter.

2382
01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.830
SAM: 13 plus nine.

2383
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:21.154
MATT: Yeah, I think-- okay. So you also have

2384
01:32:21.154 --> 01:32:22.987
a fluffernutter pouch.

2385
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:26.778
Which acts as--

2386
01:32:26.778 --> 01:32:28.760
the same as dynamite, or blasting powder.

2387
01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.950
SAM: I am so happy.
MATT: Okay.

2388
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:31.783
SAM: That's it.

2389
01:32:31.783 --> 01:32:33.830
MATT: All right, so you finished the construction there.

2390
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:35.970
Anybody else have anything else they want to accomplish--

2391
01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:36.803
SAM: Yash-er?

2392
01:32:36.803 --> 01:32:41.803
ASHLEY: Yeah, I would love to pick up my bracers, and--

2393
01:32:42.184 --> 01:32:43.990
MATT: Yeah, forged, comfortable, they're made

2394
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:46.270
to the specifications, and the shapes

2395
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:48.450
that Wursh went ahead and--

2396
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:51.900
Wursh crafted for you.
ASHLEY: Yes.

2397
01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:56.723
Is there an enchanter in town, or anything like that?

2398
01:32:56.723 --> 01:32:57.770
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2399
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:58.603
ASHLEY: Okay.

2400
01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.940
LIAM: Yo, girl, pick up my clothes.

2401
01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:04.870
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, we all got to pick up our clothes.

2402
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:06.140
LIAM: You did, but mine's--

2403
01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:07.900
ASHLEY: It's cocked.

2404
01:33:11.787 --> 01:33:14.161
Where is my investigation? 10.

2405
01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:16.385
MATT: Okay.

2406
01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:23.490
Magical enchanting is not a common thing to be found

2407
01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.710
in most areas of the city.

2408
01:33:27.710 --> 01:33:29.040
I mean, even just the encounter you had

2409
01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.540
with the Invulnerable Vagrant in Zadash was one

2410
01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.350
of the few in the Empire, and only

2411
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:35.860
because Zadash is one of the larger cities

2412
01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.750
of the establishment.

2413
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:40.220
Asking around, the best information you get is

2414
01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.280
that you probably have to commission somebody

2415
01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.250
at the Marble Tomes Conservatory.

2416
01:33:46.190 --> 01:33:47.023
ASHLEY: Okay.

2417
01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:50.340
All right.

2418
01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:51.200
MATT: Which you could do.

2419
01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.300
ASHLEY: Yeah, which I could--

2420
01:33:54.058 --> 01:33:55.750
LIAM: Just head on over.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2421
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:57.640
TALIESIN: Head on over to the Marble Tome.

2422
01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:59.870
ASHLEY: Would anyone like to go to the Marble Tomes?

2423
01:33:59.870 --> 01:34:01.368
I'm going to head over there for--

2424
01:34:01.368 --> 01:34:02.820
I just have to ask some things.

2425
01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:04.260
LAURA: Yasha I want to so bad,

2426
01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:06.400
we're just making this spa, and, like--

2427
01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.791
TALIESIN: This thing is really taking up

2428
01:34:07.791 --> 01:34:09.024
everything right now.

2429
01:34:09.024 --> 01:34:10.231
MARISHA: I'll go with you.
ASHLEY: Yeah?

2430
01:34:12.330 --> 01:34:14.000
MATT: So Beau and Yasha are going?

2431
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.510
TRAVIS: Wait, what are the t-- like a library?

2432
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:17.160
LAURA: That's where Waccoh is.

2433
01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.780
LIAM: Yeah, I know.

2434
01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.012
I would go.

2435
01:34:20.012 --> 01:34:21.845
TRAVIS: I'll go, too, because I'm bored.

2436
01:34:21.845 --> 01:34:22.970
ASHLEY: All right.

2437
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:23.803
MATT: Okay.

2438
01:34:23.803 --> 01:34:26.645
TALIESIN: It's like a reverse shopping episode for you.

2439
01:34:27.784 --> 01:34:29.742
TRAVIS: I just wanted shutters.

2440
01:34:29.742 --> 01:34:32.044
(laughter)

2441
01:34:32.044 --> 01:34:33.800
TALIESIN: I was wondering about that, to be honest.

2442
01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.690
Expecting an explanation.
SAM: (as Fjord) Enchanted shutters.

2443
01:34:35.690 --> 01:34:36.870
MATT: We'll get to that in just a second.

2444
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:40.023
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I'm hiding in his room up there.

2445
01:34:40.023 --> 01:34:42.340
MATT: You guys arrive-- you recognize from the time

2446
01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:44.450
that you've been here with Caleb

2447
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:46.800
to eventually talk your way through,

2448
01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.210
and find at least one of the guards

2449
01:34:48.210 --> 01:34:49.750
who was here previously when you had met with Waccoh.

2450
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:53.700
MARISHA: Yes, it's the same humans, yes, those humans, yes.

2451
01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:55.430
LIAM: Yes.

2452
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:58.010
MATT: Perfect.
(laughter)

2453
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.110
TALIESIN: Charmed your way in again.

2454
01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:00.172
MATT: You did.

2455
01:35:00.172 --> 01:35:01.660
TRAVIS: Is that how you talk to them every time?

2456
01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:02.840
MARISHA: I'm trying.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2457
01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.210
MARISHA: We haven't had a manners lesson in a while.

2458
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.821
Getting rusty.

2459
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:10.010
MATT: All right, so the three of you step

2460
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:11.830
into the Marble Tomes Conservatory,

2461
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:14.460
you ask for enchanting services.

2462
01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.140
Normally, they are relegated specifically

2463
01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.970
with these times as part of the war effort.

2464
01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:21.200
They have their approvals you have to go through,

2465
01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.900
because most of the enchanters are currently in the process

2466
01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:26.470
of developing things for use on the front lines,

2467
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:29.050
or any of their various scouting missions,

2468
01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:33.110
or independent strike crews.

2469
01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:36.760
However, because you do have the Beacon

2470
01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.740
of the Bright Queen, and depending

2471
01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:41.980
on the time commitment involved, they say, well,

2472
01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:45.040
at least have a conversation with one of the enchanters.

2473
01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:48.390
And they call out for somebody who arrives.

2474
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:49.223
You see a

2475
01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:54.540
very young, fresh-faced dark-elf woman,

2476
01:35:57.154 --> 01:36:01.320
the equivalent of what you'd expect a late teens human,

2477
01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:04.220
as far as just bright eyed,

2478
01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:07.590
and excited. Smooth, young skin.

2479
01:36:08.458 --> 01:36:10.840
LIAM: (whispers) She's a hundred.

2480
01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.040
MATT: Maybe, you don't know.

2481
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.310
You're not even there.

2482
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:15.791
LIAM: Yes, I am, I thought I went with them.

2483
01:36:15.791 --> 01:36:18.649
Or did they leave Fjord and Caleb behind?

2484
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:20.820
The four of us went walking together.

2485
01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:21.820
MATT: Oh, you're going-- okay,

2486
01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:23.189
I thought you said you were still waiting for him.

2487
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:25.360
LIAM: That happens at some point in this week--

2488
01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.410
MATT: Okay, gotcha, all right,

2489
01:36:26.410 --> 01:36:28.620
so you are joining in, all right.

2490
01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:32.510
But they step out and, "Hello, I am Enchanter Yun,

2491
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:36.820
"and I have been-- this is a curious group."

2492
01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.940
ASHLEY: Hello.

2493
01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:42.220
LIAM: The most curious, yes, but.
ASHLEY: Yes.

2494
01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:43.540
LIAM: Blessed by--
MATT: "Right?"

2495
01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:44.620
LIAM: She herself.

2496
01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:46.513
MATT: "I've heard rumors, people have been talking

2497
01:36:46.513 --> 01:36:49.110
"of the visitors, yes.

2498
01:36:49.110 --> 01:36:50.430
"Are you them?"

2499
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:51.720
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Some of them, yeah.

2500
01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:54.360
ASHLEY: Yeah, just a handful.

2501
01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:56.250
MATT: "I didn't think I would actually get a chance

2502
01:36:56.250 --> 01:37:00.110
"to see who that is. Oh, you've become quite a--

2503
01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.820
"quite a conversation piece in the Conservatory."

2504
01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:07.440
MARISHA: Only good things, I hope.

2505
01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.273
MATT: "Primarily."

2506
01:37:08.273 --> 01:37:10.640
LIAM: Has Waccoh spoken well of us?

2507
01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.763
MATT: "Waccoh, nobody really speaks to Waccoh,

2508
01:37:12.763 --> 01:37:16.000
"but there has been rumors spreading of

2509
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:22.610
"the human folk, the ex-pats,

2510
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:24.522
"helping the Queen."
LIAM: Ouch.

2511
01:37:26.148 --> 01:37:27.388
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2512
01:37:27.388 --> 01:37:28.760
LIAM: We come with a bit of business,

2513
01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.350
though, our friend here is--

2514
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:32.225
ASHLEY: I have these bracers,

2515
01:37:32.225 --> 01:37:33.725
and I wanted to see if you could,

2516
01:37:33.725 --> 01:37:36.400
by chance, enchant them.

2517
01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.940
MATT: "Let me see."
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2518
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:42.400
MATT: "Oh, these are finely made, they are definitely ready

2519
01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.780
"for an-- what sort of enchantment are you looking for,

2520
01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.013
"if I might ask?"

2521
01:37:46.013 --> 01:37:48.930
ASHLEY: I'm looking for something that would

2522
01:37:50.199 --> 01:37:52.430
give me a little bit more protection.

2523
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:54.246
MATT: "Protective magic, right.

2524
01:37:54.246 --> 01:37:55.487
More of an abjuration-based."

2525
01:37:55.487 --> 01:37:56.830
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2526
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:58.140
MATT: "That could be done, yes.

2527
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:01.666
"Something similar to what she

2528
01:38:01.666 --> 01:38:02.500
is holding right there, maybe?"

2529
01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.390
ASHLEY: Yes, that was the inspiration, so.

2530
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:05.680
MATT: "Okay, yes."

2531
01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:07.930
LIAM: Could you do the same with this precious gold ring?

2532
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:11.490
MATT: "Maybe, let me see, yes, something like

2533
01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:15.380
"that could also be done. I will say it is an expensive

2534
01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.960
"and timely process, a time consuming process, depending

2535
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.750
"on how much you want to pay, time can be quicker,

2536
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:25.060
"because we get more enchanters to help out,

2537
01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.250
"to cut the time in half.

2538
01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:31.530
"For one such an enchantment here, it would run about--

2539
01:38:34.753 --> 01:38:37.800
"3,000 gold pieces."

2540
01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.633
ASHLEY: What if--

2541
01:38:38.633 --> 01:38:40.260
MATT: "And would take roughly,

2542
01:38:43.421 --> 01:38:44.637
"I would say,

2543
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:47.670
"about ten weeks."

2544
01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:48.770
ASHLEY: Ten weeks.

2545
01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:52.080
MATT: "But, but if--

2546
01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:56.964
"if you were to pay an additional, say,

2547
01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:59.580
"60 percent onto that price, we can have a second enchanter,

2548
01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:01.180
"and have it done in five weeks."

2549
01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:04.130
LIAM: That is a little rich for my blood,

2550
01:39:04.130 --> 01:39:07.030
I will take the ring. Thank you for the information, though.

2551
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:11.293
MATT: "No problem. Well, our services are available,

2552
01:39:11.293 --> 01:39:16.293
"at least as long as you carry those emblems."

2553
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:24.530
ASHLEY: What if we did a payment plan situation?

2554
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:25.630
LIAM: Layaway.

2555
01:39:25.630 --> 01:39:26.704
ASHLEY: A layaway.

2556
01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:30.670
MATT: "Meaning?"

2557
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:33.090
ASHLEY: Not to brag, but right now,

2558
01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:36.660
I could offer you 455 gold pieces.

2559
01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.147
That's all I have, so.

2560
01:39:44.436 --> 01:39:46.542
It could be to start, and then whenever they're ready,

2561
01:39:46.542 --> 01:39:47.633
I can come back

2562
01:39:47.633 --> 01:39:50.340
and give you more money every time I get some.

2563
01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:52.727
MATT: "Here, I will tell you this.

2564
01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.340
If you could

2565
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:01.280
"provide

2566
01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.835
"at least 1,000 gold,

2567
01:40:04.450 --> 01:40:06.780
"we could begin, and expect the remainder

2568
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:08.596
of payment upon completion."

2569
01:40:09.755 --> 01:40:11.146
TRAVIS: We could do that.

2570
01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:14.388
MATT: "If you wanted quicker still,

2571
01:40:14.388 --> 01:40:16.804
for the half time period,

2572
01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:21.210
"1,500 gold, and a five week creation process.

2573
01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.700
"This is under the expectation that should you not turn up

2574
01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:30.690
"for the remainder amount, the project is forfeited

2575
01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:34.370
"to the Dynasty, and it is to be outfitted

2576
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:36.950
"to one of our elite soldiers."

2577
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:39.890
TRAVIS: What would you say if we were to offer our services

2578
01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:42.260
for a slight discount on that item?

2579
01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.550
Surely there's some dirty work you need done.

2580
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:49.520
MATT: "Me? No, not-- I--

2581
01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:53.390
"I spend most of my time and, well, to be honest,

2582
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:57.700
"most of my life within these halls since coming of age, but

2583
01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:03.110
"I'm sure there are means of making coin throughout,

2584
01:41:03.978 --> 01:41:04.980
"in these times."

2585
01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:06.460
TRAVIS: Oh, there's

2586
01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.200
no shortage of that, just curious if

2587
01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:12.070
you needed any particular itches scratched.

2588
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:13.760
MATT: "Me, no. I--

2589
01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.940
"I'm just--" And you see her eyes get a little,

2590
01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:18.180
a little embarrassed, "I'm,

2591
01:41:19.410 --> 01:41:21.870
"I'm more of a-- a researcher."

2592
01:41:22.770 --> 01:41:25.290
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Yasha, I have the other half

2593
01:41:25.290 --> 01:41:26.790
of that thousand, if you want.

2594
01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:31.380
ASHLEY: That's a lot of money, Fjord.

2595
01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:32.980
TRAVIS: Yeah, but.

2596
01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.710
You got to get some fucking protection.

2597
01:41:35.710 --> 01:41:37.710
You get hit all the time.

2598
01:41:37.710 --> 01:41:38.760
ASHLEY: Yeah, I do.
TRAVIS: Yep.

2599
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.760
It's almost like I've seen it myself.

2600
01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:45.280
ASHLEY: I'll pay you back, how about that?

2601
01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.280
TRAVIS: Deal.
ASHLEY: Okay.

2602
01:41:47.370 --> 01:41:50.010
All right, if we leave you 1,000, I'll leave these,

2603
01:41:51.450 --> 01:41:54.790
and we'll come back for-- I'll bring the rest.

2604
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:56.173
MATT: "All right, ten weeks?"

2605
01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.760
ASHLEY: Ten weeks.

2606
01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.260
MARISHA: Maybe we can speed the process a little--

2607
01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:01.430
ASHLEY: Maybe we can spreed the process up.

2608
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:03.540
LIAM: Throw in a little more later.

2609
01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:04.373
Catch it up.

2610
01:42:04.373 --> 01:42:05.780
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: "All right, yes.

2611
01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:08.190
"You come back, if there is more money to be put down,

2612
01:42:08.190 --> 01:42:11.370
"we can definitely hire then an additional enchanter

2613
01:42:11.370 --> 01:42:16.003
"with the rest of the amount to be given upon receipt.

2614
01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:18.930
"But like I said, we have to agree

2615
01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.780
"that this payment is forfeit if you do not return

2616
01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:24.820
"to pick up the item."

2617
01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:27.015
LIAM: Within the ten weeks.
ASHLEY: Within the ten weeks?

2618
01:42:27.015 --> 01:42:29.007
MATT: "For the full payment, yes."

2619
01:42:29.007 --> 01:42:31.100
LIAM: Yeah, full payment.
ASHLEY: Okay, good to know.

2620
01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.100
LIAM: That is easy for us.
ASHLEY: That's fine.

2621
01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:35.910
We'll make that.
MATT: "Very well."

2622
01:42:36.930 --> 01:42:38.570
All right, so you guys pay the 1,000 gold.

2623
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:39.403
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2624
01:42:39.403 --> 01:42:40.530
MATT: Distributed however you see fit.

2625
01:42:40.530 --> 01:42:42.684
SAM: 1,000 gold?
TRAVIS: I got it.

2626
01:42:42.684 --> 01:42:44.675
SAM: Is Yasha really that important?
LIAM: 3k total.

2627
01:42:44.675 --> 01:42:46.442
TRAVIS: AC? Uh-huh.

2628
01:42:46.442 --> 01:42:49.120
MARISHA: Is there a public book area?

2629
01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.880
Because I know there's a special book area.

2630
01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:53.700
Is there a public book area where we can get to

2631
01:42:54.658 --> 01:42:56.120
in this place, or no?

2632
01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.630
MATT: No. This is-- asking around,

2633
01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:04.870
you get the sense that this library contains a lot

2634
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:08.210
of very sensitive, arcane information

2635
01:43:08.210 --> 01:43:09.852
that is considered both

2636
01:43:11.630 --> 01:43:15.090
important, historically. Powerful,

2637
01:43:15.090 --> 01:43:19.670
as a lot of arcane depositories are.

2638
01:43:22.670 --> 01:43:27.317
But also-- not suppository. Arcane suppository is another,

2639
01:43:27.317 --> 01:43:29.200
whole different thing.
(laughter)

2640
01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.440
I can see forever.
(laughter)

2641
01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:38.990
But also, if they have any dunamantic elements,

2642
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:41.960
those are probably very much considered

2643
01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:44.900
of interest to anyone directly within the state,

2644
01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:48.803
or of approved interest.

2645
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:53.130
ASHLEY: Do you want Fjord and I to create a distraction?

2646
01:43:53.130 --> 01:43:55.710
MARISHA and LIAM: No.
ASHLEY: Okay.

2647
01:43:55.710 --> 01:43:57.730
LIAM: No, we are going to earn this the proper way.

2648
01:43:57.730 --> 01:44:00.800
I, before we leave, write out a handwritten invitation

2649
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.460
to Professor Waccoh to visit the first Kryn tree house here

2650
01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:06.100
in Rosohna.

2651
01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:06.950
MATT: All righty.

2652
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:09.010
LIAM: And leave it with this woman.

2653
01:44:09.010 --> 01:44:10.896
MATT: All right.

2654
01:44:10.896 --> 01:44:12.810
Okay.

2655
01:44:12.810 --> 01:44:16.570
As you guys are returning, as you approach the exterior

2656
01:44:16.570 --> 01:44:19.830
of the house, you see a familiar mantled figure,

2657
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:23.000
arms emerge in the front of the cloak.

2658
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.950
The mantle of Essek is looking up at the tree,

2659
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:29.680
and the lights that are currently being strung

2660
01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.380
across the canopy by both Caduceus and

2661
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:36.600
Jester in a very precarious and dangerous way,

2662
01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.950
as it is a very tall tree. (laughs)

2663
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:41.040
You don't really have a ladder.

2664
01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:45.080
"This is--"
LAURA: I'm definitely up on your shoulders.

2665
01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:49.330
"You've certainly made it comfortable quickly."

2666
01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:50.163
MARISHA: Yeah.

2667
01:44:50.163 --> 01:44:51.970
LIAM: We're making ourselves at home.

2668
01:44:51.970 --> 01:44:53.768
MATT: "I can see that.

2669
01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:59.290
"Made a-- made a splash."

2670
01:44:59.290 --> 01:45:01.600
MARISHA: Do you want to stay for dinner?

2671
01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.960
Caduceus is probably whipping

2672
01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.650
up something delicious and vegan.

2673
01:45:05.650 --> 01:45:09.005
MATT: "No, I'm quite all right, I have some research to do,

2674
01:45:09.005 --> 01:45:11.029
"but I appreciate the offer."

2675
01:45:11.029 --> 01:45:12.746
MARISHA: You want a rain check?

2676
01:45:12.746 --> 01:45:14.390
TRAVIS: Boy, your face just does not look

2677
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:16.460
as inviting as you think it does.

2678
01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:18.147
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, see I hadn't-- sorry.

2679
01:45:18.147 --> 01:45:19.952
TRAVIS: Yeah, just get a little pinch on the--

2680
01:45:19.952 --> 01:45:22.105
LIAM: What is the nature of your research?

2681
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:27.248
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2682
01:45:28.321 --> 01:45:31.037
TRAVIS: (sternly) Do you want to come in for dinner?

2683
01:45:31.037 --> 01:45:32.778
LAURA and MATT: Aww.

2684
01:45:36.690 --> 01:45:39.480
MATT: "My specialities."

2685
01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:41.713
MARISHA: Well, would you like to--

2686
01:45:41.713 --> 01:45:43.163
(clears throat) Sorry.

2687
01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:46.910
Would you like to take a break from your research,

2688
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:48.901
and maybe just get a drink?

2689
01:45:48.901 --> 01:45:49.984
LAURA: So scary.

2690
01:45:49.984 --> 01:45:51.687
LIAM: I start taking notes.

2691
01:45:51.687 --> 01:45:53.670
TALIESIN: It's like a Batman villain.

2692
01:45:53.670 --> 01:45:55.340
MATT: "I'm all right, but thank you."

2693
01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:57.771
MARISHA: All right.

2694
01:45:57.771 --> 01:45:59.570
MATT: "But, interesting.

2695
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:02.390
"Definitely the first."

2696
01:46:03.330 --> 01:46:05.190
TRAVIS: Do you know anything about our neighbors

2697
01:46:05.190 --> 01:46:08.270
to the left, the family of Lord Bilan?

2698
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:11.508
MATT: "Stuffy sort."
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2699
01:46:11.508 --> 01:46:13.553
Not very talkative, or friendly.

2700
01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:17.010
MATT: "Well, let's be real, you--"

2701
01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:20.430
TRAVIS: Yeah, the-- the tree.

2702
01:46:20.430 --> 01:46:22.770
By the way, I tried to ask,

2703
01:46:22.770 --> 01:46:27.370
just in case he was also a member of Den Thalen, Thelyss?

2704
01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:31.380
He didn't volunteer what den he was a part of,

2705
01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:33.690
is that a faux pas?

2706
01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:35.890
LIAM: Touchy subject.

2707
01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:40.550
MATT: "Not particularly, no, but he is from Den Bilan."

2708
01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:43.180
TRAVIS: Den Bilan.

2709
01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:46.022
MATT: "The surnames, they're adopted from the dens."

2710
01:46:47.410 --> 01:46:48.685
MARISHA: But there's four dens, right?

2711
01:46:48.685 --> 01:46:49.518
There's only four dens?

2712
01:46:49.518 --> 01:46:51.540
TRAVIS: Got his own cell service, okay.

2713
01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:53.370
SAM: There's three primary--

2714
01:46:53.370 --> 01:46:54.820
MATT: "Three primary dens, and there are--"

2715
01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:56.673
SAM: And then there's many other dens.

2716
01:46:56.673 --> 01:46:59.290
MARISHA: There's many dens.
MATT: "A dozen dens."

2717
01:46:59.290 --> 01:47:00.570
MARISHA: Dozens and dozens.

2718
01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:02.380
TRAVIS: Yeah, Bilan's not one of the main three, though.

2719
01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:04.705
MATT: "No."

2720
01:47:04.705 --> 01:47:06.300
MATT: "Thelyss is one."

2721
01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.420
ASHLEY: Do you know who lives-- who our other neighbors are?

2722
01:47:10.661 --> 01:47:13.087
LIAM: It seems empty to us, but apparently not?

2723
01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.460
MATT: "I'm not too familiar with this neighborhood."

2724
01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:18.881
TRAVIS: Do I believe him?

2725
01:47:18.881 --> 01:47:20.740
MATT: Make an insight check.

2726
01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:22.930
TRAVIS: He knows that there's a team of mercenaries,

2727
01:47:22.930 --> 01:47:25.090
and they're-- 11.
MATT: 11.

2728
01:47:25.090 --> 01:47:29.200
He seems like he's looking around, not too familiar.

2729
01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:34.343
He just goes, "I-- I don't know.

2730
01:47:34.343 --> 01:47:36.680
"I don't live in this area, so."

2731
01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:38.420
ASHLEY: Where do you live?

2732
01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:39.820
MATT: "Why do you ask?"

2733
01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:43.610
ASHLEY: I was just-- I want to know more about you.

2734
01:47:45.501 --> 01:47:46.701
And get to know the-- the

2735
01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:51.740
place that we are living in at the moment.

2736
01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:55.180
What neighborhood? I'm being very forward, I'm sorry,

2737
01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:57.866
you don't have to tell me, nevermind.

2738
01:47:57.866 --> 01:47:59.475
SAM: What's your home address?

2739
01:47:59.475 --> 01:48:03.933
(laughter)

2740
01:48:03.933 --> 01:48:05.773
SAM: Tell me your address and phone number.

2741
01:48:05.773 --> 01:48:08.135
MATT: If you don't mind, just throwing it out there.

2742
01:48:08.135 --> 01:48:08.968
TRAVIS: You don't have to, but

2743
01:48:08.968 --> 01:48:10.100
if you wanted to write it down--

2744
01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:13.160
MATT: "Most of my den live within the Lucid Bastion,

2745
01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:16.260
"but I spend a lot of my time either researching

2746
01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:18.470
"dunamantic pursuits within the Bastion,

2747
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:21.660
"or within the Conservatory."

2748
01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:24.630
LIAM: Are those the main avenues for learning such?

2749
01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:26.678
MATT: "They are the only avenues.

2750
01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.980
"Why do you ask?"

2751
01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:34.590
LIAM: Well, I am a big learner, I'm curious.

2752
01:48:36.530 --> 01:48:39.030
I know that we are new here, but I am very interested

2753
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:42.800
in tutelage in this field, and you have been privy

2754
01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:46.090
to our conversations with your queen, and--

2755
01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:48.921
MATT: "Show me.

2756
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:53.710
"Show me something impressive, show me something

2757
01:48:53.710 --> 01:48:56.380
"at the height of your power. You are arcanist, yes?"

2758
01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:59.760
MARISHA: Do you want to go inside for this?

2759
01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:02.320
Or at least in the threshold of the walls

2760
01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:03.990
and not be in the street?
MATT: "I think if you are,

2761
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:06.070
"if you are trained enough to be pursuing such things,

2762
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:08.740
"that you would know the limits and the safety

2763
01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:11.057
"of your capabilities, so.

2764
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:14.623
"Show me."

2765
01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:17.263
LIAM: A translucent cat floats

2766
01:49:17.263 --> 01:49:19.390
just in front of Essek's face,

2767
01:49:19.390 --> 01:49:23.430
and (explosion) a gigantic claw flexes

2768
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:25.880
in front of Essek, between me and him,

2769
01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:29.130
and is interposing between me and him.

2770
01:49:29.130 --> 01:49:30.470
MARISHA: I immediately look around

2771
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:31.660
and see if anyone's watching.

2772
01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:32.876
MATT: A lot of people are watching.

2773
01:49:32.876 --> 01:49:34.060
TRAVIS: A whole bunch.

2774
01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:34.893
MATT: I mean--

2775
01:49:34.893 --> 01:49:37.310
SAM: This is the third weirdest thing that's happened.

2776
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:39.430
MATT: Yeah, it's-- you guys have become

2777
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:42.346
the weird neighbors real fast.

2778
01:49:42.346 --> 01:49:45.760
LIAM: And the cat claw does one of these.

2779
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:48.480
MATT: "Interesting.

2780
01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:53.400
"And, if I might ask, what is it that you're seeking?

2781
01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.170
"What is your ultimate goal? Anyone who pursues such magics,

2782
01:49:58.170 --> 01:50:00.970
"to an extent, has something that they wish to do."

2783
01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:06.650
LIAM: I am of middling experience in the traditional sense.

2784
01:50:06.650 --> 01:50:10.750
What I'm very curious about is the arcane here,

2785
01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:15.070
in your country.
MATT: "Yes, you and many.

2786
01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:16.380
"Many, many."
LIAM: Yes.

2787
01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:20.890
But as you know, my people are perverting your magic,

2788
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:25.890
and we wish to work with you to prevent that,

2789
01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:30.221
as we have exhibited, and I wish to understand better,

2790
01:50:30.221 --> 01:50:32.790
so that I can better help.

2791
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:34.270
MATT: Make one more persuasion check.

2792
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:36.550
LAURA: Ooh, come on--
SAM: Come on, Caleb.

2793
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:39.080
Come on, Cay-Cay.

2794
01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:41.340
LIAM: Just the 12.
MATT: Just the 12?

2795
01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:43.140
LIAM: No-- yeah.

2796
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:45.199
SAM: I'll inspire you.

2797
01:50:45.199 --> 01:50:47.300
MATT: Okay. He looks over and goes,

2798
01:50:52.991 --> 01:50:54.291
"Are you busy right now?"

2799
01:50:54.291 --> 01:50:55.541
LAURA: (gasps)

2800
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.760
MATT: "May I enter?"

2801
01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.900
MARISHA: I invited you twice, but yeah,

2802
01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:08.540
yeah, go ahead, enter, yeah.

2803
01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:11.190
TRAVIS: Yes, it would be lovely to have you inside our home.

2804
01:51:11.190 --> 01:51:13.115
MARISHA: I mean, yes--
MATT: "I wasn't asking you."

2805
01:51:13.115 --> 01:51:15.290
MARISHA: The fuck?
TRAVIS: Next time.

2806
01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:17.180
LIAM: The cats claw turns sideways,

2807
01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:20.790
and just one claw hooks into the door, and pulls it open.

2808
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:22.525
TALIESIN: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

2809
01:51:22.525 --> 01:51:24.100
(laughter)

2810
01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:25.390
LAURA: Hi, everyone.

2811
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:27.910
MATT: He looks up.
LAURA: We look down from the tree.

2812
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:30.122
SAM: I'm getting out of the hot tub with Yeza.

2813
01:51:30.122 --> 01:51:32.253
(laughter)

2814
01:51:32.253 --> 01:51:34.451
Oh, did we have company?

2815
01:51:34.451 --> 01:51:36.092
TRAVIS: Put 'em away, put 'em away.

2816
01:51:36.092 --> 01:51:36.934
SAM: Oh--

2817
01:51:37.984 --> 01:51:40.581
(laughter)

2818
01:51:40.581 --> 01:51:45.581
LIAM: A slight bow. Do come in.

2819
01:51:46.293 --> 01:51:47.430
MATT: He just glides over,

2820
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:49.340
and looks toward the closest thing there is

2821
01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:52.291
to the study that you guys have set up at this time.

2822
01:51:52.291 --> 01:51:53.797
"A bit empty, but it could work."

2823
01:51:53.797 --> 01:51:55.340
MARISHA: Do you want that cocktail?

2824
01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:57.440
Caduceus has been making something with turmeric

2825
01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.360
that's really weird.
TRAVIS: Face, face!

2826
01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:02.420
MARISHA: It's a very refreshing cocktail,

2827
01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:05.710
perfect for this nice fall breeze.

2828
01:52:08.347 --> 01:52:10.055
MATT: "Sure."
MARISHA: Jesus Christ.

2829
01:52:10.055 --> 01:52:12.530
Look at that. Did you see that fucking host?

2830
01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:14.621
I'm a fucking host!

2831
01:52:14.621 --> 01:52:15.454
Yeah!

2832
01:52:15.454 --> 01:52:17.710
SAM: Hosting.
MARISHA: Hosting.

2833
01:52:17.710 --> 01:52:20.018
MATT: So--
MARISHA: Take that hospitality.

2834
01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:24.820
MATT: Essek traces something in the air with his finger,

2835
01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:28.290
and you-- this slight glow emerges,

2836
01:52:28.290 --> 01:52:30.590
and you watch from the glow as it pulls out

2837
01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:34.115
and widens, a tome just apparates into his hand.

2838
01:52:34.115 --> 01:52:35.200
TALIESIN: Baller.

2839
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:37.135
His other hand comes out from under the cloak,

2840
01:52:37.135 --> 01:52:39.160
and flicks through.

2841
01:52:40.182 --> 01:52:42.137
"Do you have means of copying?

2842
01:52:45.924 --> 01:52:47.450
"Let me teach you a few things."

2843
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:48.916
(group gasps)

2844
01:52:48.916 --> 01:52:49.758
MARISHA: Dope!

2845
01:52:49.758 --> 01:52:51.480
LAURA: Oh, damn.
MATT: So he--

2846
01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:54.730
he will teach you up to three spell levels

2847
01:52:55.570 --> 01:52:57.003
of dunamantic magic.

2848
01:52:57.003 --> 01:52:59.638
(group cheers)

2849
01:52:59.638 --> 01:53:01.615
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

2850
01:53:01.615 --> 01:53:03.648
Don't smile, motherfucker, don't get excited.

2851
01:53:03.648 --> 01:53:06.200
LIAM: Well, stop flipping out then.

2852
01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.370
MATT: "So this could be three

2853
01:53:10.130 --> 01:53:12.420
"utility, meager spells of dunamancy,

2854
01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:14.600
"you have a few things at your disposal.

2855
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:19.400
"There is also a few with a slight more kick.

2856
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:22.247
"And-- or one,

2857
01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:27.330
"it is a little more of a influence, if you will.

2858
01:53:27.330 --> 01:53:29.750
"What is your interest? Are you interested

2859
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:31.968
"in things such as

2860
01:53:33.110 --> 01:53:38.110
"density, gravity, things that manipulate the relationship

2861
01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:39.607
"between objects?

2862
01:53:39.607 --> 01:53:41.080
"Are you more interested

2863
01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:44.866
"in the bending of fate, destiny?

2864
01:53:44.866 --> 01:53:46.924
SAM: Ding, ding, ding, ding.

2865
01:53:47.970 --> 01:53:50.660
MATT: "Or do you wish to find ways to

2866
01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:56.280
"sap and scatter the potentiality of your enemy?"

2867
01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:57.890
LIAM: Let's go back one.

2868
01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:02.623
MATT: "All right.

2869
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:09.641
"We have--"

2870
01:54:15.637 --> 01:54:17.040
Offers you these two.

2871
01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.180
TRAVIS: Oh, shit crackers.

2872
01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:20.560
LAURA: What is it, what is it?

2873
01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.634
SAM: Don't worry, he'll never tell us.

2874
01:54:22.634 --> 01:54:24.186
LAURA: He'll never tell us.

2875
01:54:25.161 --> 01:54:27.019
SAM: ♪ I'll never tell ♪

2876
01:54:30.674 --> 01:54:32.380
MATT: And so take the necessary time,

2877
01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:34.609
and the necessary cost of paper and ink

2878
01:54:34.609 --> 01:54:36.980
to copy those spells into your spell book.

2879
01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:37.813
LIAM: Okay.

2880
01:54:37.813 --> 01:54:39.340
MATT: And when you complete, you can see

2881
01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:40.760
there's plenty of other spells in the book,

2882
01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.137
but he watches you like a hawk.

2883
01:54:42.137 --> 01:54:44.020
Every time you get interested to peek,

2884
01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:47.940
you can sense his presence looming, and it's--

2885
01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:52.500
you gather you would not want to challenge that trust.

2886
01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.605
Upon the completion of the secondary spell--

2887
01:54:54.605 --> 01:54:57.210
LIAM: I can barely afford to do these two, so.

2888
01:54:57.210 --> 01:54:59.200
MATT: The tome closes, and you watch as it

2889
01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:03.223
almost seems to spark and scatter away into nothing.

2890
01:55:03.223 --> 01:55:04.476
LAURA: Wow.

2891
01:55:06.193 --> 01:55:08.090
MARISHA: (ice cubes clattering)

2892
01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:08.923
MATT: "Thank you."

2893
01:55:08.923 --> 01:55:11.050
TRAVIS: Moscow mule?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2894
01:55:12.570 --> 01:55:15.095
MATT: "I'm interested to see what you do with these."

2895
01:55:16.867 --> 01:55:20.490
LIAM: I need a little bit of time.

2896
01:55:20.490 --> 01:55:21.323
MATT: "Rudimentary,

2897
01:55:21.323 --> 01:55:24.130
but they are the beginning building blocks."

2898
01:55:24.130 --> 01:55:26.980
LIAM: This is a great gift.

2899
01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:28.860
MATT: "Remember it, there may be a time

2900
01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:31.011
"where I need to call a favor back in."

2901
01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:34.170
LIAM: Done.

2902
01:55:35.237 --> 01:55:37.340
MATT: "Very well."
MARISHA: What do you think?

2903
01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:39.130
LIAM: Would you like a closer look at the tree?

2904
01:55:40.842 --> 01:55:42.147
MATT: "I'm fine.

2905
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:45.172
"And it's not bad.

2906
01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:47.513
"Unique, is that

2907
01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:49.800
"turmeric?"
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2908
01:55:50.930 --> 01:55:53.725
Caduceus calls it a White Xhorhasian.

2909
01:55:53.725 --> 01:55:56.010
(laughter)

2910
01:55:56.010 --> 01:55:57.960
MATT: "Mildly racist, but--"

2911
01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.100
(laughter)

2912
01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:02.433
LIAM: Shit!

2913
01:56:02.433 --> 01:56:04.174
(laughter)

2914
01:56:04.174 --> 01:56:06.267
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2915
01:56:06.267 --> 01:56:08.341
Unintended.

2916
01:56:08.341 --> 01:56:10.400
MATT: The room gets real just quiet,

2917
01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:12.449
and awkward for a moment, he goes--

2918
01:56:12.449 --> 01:56:15.830
(laughter)

2919
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:18.453
TRAVIS: Pure intentions.
(laughter)

2920
01:56:18.453 --> 01:56:20.090
MATT: "Enjoy the rest of your evening,"

2921
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:22.010
and he leaves on that note.

2922
01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:23.810
TALIESIN: I really would have leaned with a turmeric,

2923
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:26.027
or not to turmeric.

2924
01:56:26.027 --> 01:56:27.277
MATT: Might be a better choice.

2925
01:56:27.277 --> 01:56:29.645
MARISHA: I was going for the Lebowski pull.

2926
01:56:29.645 --> 01:56:31.979
TALIESIN: No, I'm aware, yeah.

2927
01:56:31.979 --> 01:56:33.262
TRAVIS: My college years thank you.

2928
01:56:33.262 --> 01:56:34.460
TALIESIN: I did a thing today, I know.

2929
01:56:36.409 --> 01:56:37.740
MARISHA: I did a thing today, yeah.

2930
01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:39.595
TALIESIN: I'm excited about this shirt.

2931
01:56:39.595 --> 01:56:41.051
LIAM: Hot.

2932
01:56:41.051 --> 01:56:43.776
MATT: So, you have that at your disposal.

2933
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:48.190
MATT: And

2934
01:56:48.190 --> 01:56:51.090
we'll say, after the shopping is complete,

2935
01:56:51.090 --> 01:56:52.560
and Fjord, you've completed a run

2936
01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:54.560
of some of your work throughout the city,

2937
01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:57.050
you return, open the door to your chambers,

2938
01:56:57.050 --> 01:57:00.240
and Caleb is there, patiently waiting.

2939
01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.005
TRAVIS: Goddammit.
LIAM: Sorry.

2940
01:57:02.005 --> 01:57:03.668
TRAVIS: I meant to put locks on that shit.

2941
01:57:03.668 --> 01:57:05.900
LIAM: Sorry, I can help you out with that, if you wish.

2942
01:57:07.130 --> 01:57:09.255
TRAVIS: What can I-- what can I do for you?

2943
01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:14.630
LIAM: Why have you been talking to us

2944
01:57:14.630 --> 01:57:16.447
with a fake accent for months?

2945
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:20.230
TRAVIS: I'm sorry?

2946
01:57:21.130 --> 01:57:22.450
LIAM: I've heard you do it a few times,

2947
01:57:22.450 --> 01:57:25.610
I've heard a different voice come out of you.

2948
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:28.808
TRAVIS: A different voice?

2949
01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:32.525
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, Fjord, a different voice.

2950
01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:39.030
TRAVIS: I'm-- I'm afraid you've got me a little lost.

2951
01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:42.770
LIAM: I don't think so.

2952
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:45.100
And I am talking to you as one accomplished liar

2953
01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:46.957
to another.

2954
01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:58.970
TRAVIS: What do you-- what do you want me to say here?

2955
01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:05.150
LIAM: I held onto my garbage for a long time,

2956
01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.470
and you don't know all of it, and I am willing

2957
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:10.120
to tell you more.

2958
01:58:11.294 --> 01:58:12.852
I would feel better

2959
01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:15.553
knowing

2960
01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:18.930
who you are,

2961
01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:21.120
because I don't trust that I do.

2962
01:58:25.610 --> 01:58:27.070
I will tell you more if you want,

2963
01:58:27.070 --> 01:58:30.810
I will go first, if it'll make it easier for you,

2964
01:58:30.810 --> 01:58:32.960
or you consider it a better trade, but

2965
01:58:34.290 --> 01:58:35.940
we have bound ourselves together,

2966
01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:39.880
and I feel like I know this group

2967
01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:45.590
pretty well. I know Yasha better than you,

2968
01:58:45.590 --> 01:58:48.063
and she never fucking says anything.

2969
01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.928
SAM: (whispering) I love you, Ashley.
LIAM: (whispering) So do I.

2970
01:59:00.554 --> 01:59:01.387
LIAM: What do you think, we're going to

2971
01:59:01.387 --> 01:59:02.920
chase you out of here,

2972
01:59:03.810 --> 01:59:05.060
run you off?

2973
01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:10.090
I find it hard to believe that anything you tell me,

2974
01:59:10.090 --> 01:59:13.508
maybe I'm wrong, but is worse than what is inside my head.

2975
01:59:16.253 --> 01:59:19.095
TRAVIS: Oh, no, I don't think that's it at all.

2976
01:59:24.710 --> 01:59:28.890
It is not in me to speak about myself, it appears

2977
01:59:30.450 --> 01:59:32.650
that the same is true for you.

2978
01:59:34.641 --> 01:59:35.474
Um.

2979
01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:45.280
I found myself

2980
01:59:47.590 --> 01:59:51.113
reinvented when I woke up on that shore,

2981
01:59:51.113 --> 01:59:52.921
when I wake up at night,

2982
01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:55.725
spitting up water, it's--

2983
01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:58.555
reminders of a time

2984
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:04.645
when the rest of my life no longer mattered, didn't apply.

2985
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:11.503
I didn't care for that life,

2986
02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:14.420
didn't care for me.

2987
02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:20.720
I prefer to

2988
02:00:22.214 --> 02:00:23.779
leave it in the past.

2989
02:00:26.370 --> 02:00:29.093
It's not that I'm hiding anything from you, I--

2990
02:00:38.850 --> 02:00:41.040
I don't want to bring things from my old life

2991
02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:42.390
into this one.

2992
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:48.283
I can sound like

2993
02:00:49.230 --> 02:00:51.100
many people, do

2994
02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:54.150
many things.
LIAM: Yeah.

2995
02:00:54.150 --> 02:00:56.300
But it's just been the one that I've heard,

2996
02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:59.150
when you think no one is listening.

2997
02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:03.270
Is that your past?

2998
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:08.383
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2999
02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.436
Yeah, it is.

3000
02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.153
LIAM: I

3001
02:01:18.630 --> 02:01:20.708
have dealt heavily with my past.

3002
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:24.940
And I worry, now more than ever,

3003
02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:26.400
that it is nipping at my heels.

3004
02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.110
Do you have worries like that,

3005
02:01:28.110 --> 02:01:31.790
do you feel like your past will come back to bite you,

3006
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:34.498
or is it just painful, and you wish to shun it?

3007
02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:39.770
Because that is the main reason I ask, this is our

3008
02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:44.815
family now.

3009
02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:48.885
And we are looking out for each other,

3010
02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:52.033
and I have told all of you

3011
02:01:53.790 --> 02:01:55.780
something I am very ashamed of,

3012
02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:58.910
because I worry about you all.

3013
02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:03.450
And maybe I just want to know that you

3014
02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:07.490
are not worried about something like that, as well.

3015
02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:10.788
I want to know what's at my back.

3016
02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:20.530
TRAVIS: You are right, you have

3017
02:02:21.713 --> 02:02:23.271
been very forthcoming.

3018
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:27.020
I admire that.

3019
02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:29.278
Especially given what you've told us.

3020
02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:35.240
There is nothing that nips at my heels,

3021
02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:37.370
or is at my back that is of danger

3022
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:39.553
to anyone else in this group.

3023
02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:43.505
I appreciate

3024
02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:46.175
you wanting to know more.

3025
02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:52.930
I almost resent you for telling us as much as you have,

3026
02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:57.500
anyone for sharing their pain.

3027
02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:03.097
It seems like the last thing I would ever want to do,

3028
02:03:03.097 --> 02:03:05.410
and to see it done with such

3029
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:11.070
conviction, resistance--

3030
02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:19.363
I'll try.

3031
02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:25.497
Give me some time.

3032
02:03:28.508 --> 02:03:31.902
I do not want to share this with the group.

3033
02:03:33.931 --> 02:03:36.453
I feel like sometimes you hold onto things

3034
02:03:36.453 --> 02:03:41.453
that make you who you are, and if you lose those things,

3035
02:03:41.730 --> 02:03:43.228
you can fall free.

3036
02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:47.190
LIAM: I have had those same thoughts

3037
02:03:48.610 --> 02:03:50.962
for a long time.

3038
02:03:54.110 --> 02:03:56.210
We can remake ourselves

3039
02:03:57.190 --> 02:03:59.528
into something better.

3040
02:04:01.650 --> 02:04:03.092
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's what I--

3041
02:04:03.092 --> 02:04:05.925
that's what I thought I was doing.

3042
02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:13.070
I promise you, here and now, there is no danger

3043
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:14.653
from my past.

3044
02:04:17.590 --> 02:04:22.590
I like this me. I love it.

3045
02:04:26.655 --> 02:04:27.705
If I would have it my way,

3046
02:04:27.705 --> 02:04:29.313
none of you would ever know anything

3047
02:04:29.313 --> 02:04:32.040
about who I was before, and I mean that.

3048
02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:39.090
I find myself on my heels in this room, please understand,

3049
02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:41.808
I'm not trying to be deceptive, just let me

3050
02:04:42.772 --> 02:04:44.770
figure out how the fuck to say it,

3051
02:04:44.770 --> 02:04:47.280
and let me come to you,

3052
02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.670
and I will feel less like I have been--

3053
02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:56.880
less like I've had something taken from me.

3054
02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:00.343
Let me find a way to tell you.

3055
02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:03.228
Please.

3056
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:08.616
LIAM: All right.

3057
02:05:10.242 --> 02:05:11.659
That's fair.

3058
02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:17.140
The only reason people in this group know anything

3059
02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:18.740
about me is because I am

3060
02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:23.847
crazy.

3061
02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:29.617
TRAVIS: I actually don't think you're crazy,

3062
02:05:29.617 --> 02:05:32.649
you're one of the more put together people I know.

3063
02:05:34.514 --> 02:05:36.320
At least that's what I see.

3064
02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.598
That's what you show.

3065
02:05:41.150 --> 02:05:42.475
Thank you for--

3066
02:05:44.435 --> 02:05:45.985
I was going to say "caring."

3067
02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:49.900
LIAM: That's accurate. Give me your hand.

3068
02:05:53.221 --> 02:05:56.158
I'm not a good person, but we are friends.

3069
02:05:57.920 --> 02:05:59.960
We are friends?

3070
02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:01.937
TRAVIS: We are friends.

3071
02:06:03.490 --> 02:06:05.515
LIAM: All right, to be continued.

3072
02:06:07.601 --> 02:06:10.184
(laughter)

3073
02:06:11.076 --> 02:06:13.159
SAM: Was that fire and water mixing?

3074
02:06:13.159 --> 02:06:14.617
LIAM: That's when we start fighting.

3075
02:06:14.617 --> 02:06:17.856
(laughter)

3076
02:06:17.856 --> 02:06:19.538
MARISHA: It was the winds of destiny.

3077
02:06:19.538 --> 02:06:22.449
(laughter)

3078
02:06:22.449 --> 02:06:26.901
MATT: All right, you guys are putting the finishing touches,

3079
02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:30.860
you're filling out the training room,

3080
02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:34.360
you're finishing on your alchemical components.

3081
02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:37.170
I don't know what you're doing right now.

3082
02:06:37.170 --> 02:06:38.553
SAM: Practicing smiling.

3083
02:06:38.553 --> 02:06:40.119

MATT: There you go.

3086
02:06:43.874 --> 02:06:45.460
TALIESIN: Figuring out that wasn't turmeric.

3087
02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:46.756
(laughter)

3088
02:06:46.756 --> 02:06:47.980
I ran out of turmeric a while ago,

3089
02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:51.160
so I don't know what you used.

3090
02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:54.660
I rolled a d20, man.
(laughter)

3091
02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:56.390
LIAM: That's Pop Rocks.

3092
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:57.870
TALIESIN: No, I don't know.

3093
02:06:57.870 --> 02:07:00.060
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

3094
02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:01.443
SAM: Oh.

3095
02:07:01.443 --> 02:07:03.209
Oh god, oh god.

3096
02:07:04.942 --> 02:07:07.582
Could be bad.
LIAM: (whispers) Under his eye.

3097
02:07:07.582 --> 02:07:10.950
TRAVIS: Not great, eight.
MATT: Eight.

3098
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:11.988
Okay.

3099
02:07:13.138 --> 02:07:14.388
We're going to go to break.

3100
02:07:14.388 --> 02:07:17.163
(group groans)

3101
02:07:18.657 --> 02:07:19.957
SAM: What would it have been?

3102
02:07:19.957 --> 02:07:22.380
MARISHA: What do you not see?
LIAM: Spies everywhere.

3103
02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:24.540
MARISHA: It's always what you don't see.

3104
02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:25.640
MATT: So we'll be back here in a few minutes,

3105
02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:27.620
we're going to take a quick little break here.

3106
02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:29.902
LAURA: It's the peephole that I painted in the room.

3107
02:07:29.902 --> 02:07:31.360
MATT: We do have,

3108
02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:32.850

3109
02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:33.683

3140
02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:54.880
TRAVIS: Henry!

3141
02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:56.960
BRIAN: Hey, let him-- let him live, dog.

3142
02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.280
DANI: He completely ignored you.

3143
02:08:58.280 --> 02:08:59.460
His eyes didn't even open.
TRAVIS: I know.

3144
02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:01.610
That is a true cattle dog. Henry!

3145
02:09:02.542 --> 02:09:04.732
DANI: Still, his eyes did not even open.

3146
02:09:04.732 --> 02:09:05.773
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Henry!

3147
02:09:05.773 --> 02:09:08.455

3151
02:09:14.759 --> 02:09:16.426
DANI: That was adorable.

3152

BRIAN: All you need to kill-- all you need

3153
02:09:17.630 --> 02:09:20.000
to kill Caleb's family is a Molotov cocktail.

3154
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.800
MARISHA: Oh!

3155
02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:24.880
TRAVIS: You can't hide behind that digital mug forever.

3156
02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:26.910

3157
02:09:26.910 --> 02:09:27.920
TRAVIS: In the lobby.

3158
02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:30.210
BRIAN: Jesus Christ, someone give me the eyes

3159
02:09:30.210 --> 02:09:31.650
when I start a joke like that.

3160
02:09:31.650 --> 02:09:34.262

3162

DANI: I've tried.

BRIAN: You're the bad guy?

3171
02:10:00.165 --> 02:10:00.998
MARISHA: I've said several times--

3172
02:10:00.998 --> 02:10:02.807
BRIAN: You just said that's what every bad guy does.

3173
02:10:02.807 --> 02:10:04.554
TRAVIS: Freudian fucking slip.
DANI: Oh!

3174
02:10:04.554 --> 02:10:07.270
BRIAN: Wait a second. Wait a second.

3175
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:11.130
MARISHA: The Mighty Nein are the bad guys.

TRAVIS: Oh, shit! We're going to turn on you

3180
02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:21.814
before you turn on us!

3181

MARISHA: I mean as a team!

We're the bad guys.

ASHLEY: For the daughter, and I got pretty close on it,

3196
02:11:07.690 --> 02:11:10.100
to the point where I had to, I had to learn a song,

3197
02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:11.360
because you know how she sings the little song--

3198

3216

02:12:33.930 --> 02:12:36.030
TALIESIN: I don't think there's anything else yet.

3244
02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:38.630
ASHLEY: That is the kick?

3245
02:12:38.630 --> 02:12:40.360
TALIESIN: Yeah, his kick is lame.

3246
02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:43.020
I am the best artist is what that--

3247
02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:43.853
ASHLEY: What does that say?

3248
02:12:43.853 --> 02:12:45.350
TALIESIN: It says, I am the best artist.

3249
02:12:46.731 --> 02:12:48.670
ASHLEY: (laughs)

3250
02:12:48.670 --> 02:12:51.361
What does that thing in the back say?

3251
02:12:51.361 --> 02:12:53.511
TALIESIN: (sounding out letters)

3252
02:12:53.511 --> 02:12:55.287
ASHLEY: Get out of here. Scram.

3253
02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:58.550
TALIESIN: I'm not entirely sure.

3254
02:12:58.550 --> 02:13:00.273
ASHLEY: Don't get crazy.

3255
02:13:00.273 --> 02:13:01.106
TALIESIN: Oh!

3256
02:13:02.253 --> 02:13:03.707
ASHLEY: Oh, come on!
TALIESIN: That's not what I

3257
02:13:03.707 --> 02:13:05.380
wanted! That's not what anybody wanted.

3258
02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:06.521
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, that's fine.

3259
02:13:06.521 --> 02:13:07.354
No!

3260
02:13:08.999 --> 02:13:11.537
No, you had three left!

3261
02:13:11.537 --> 02:13:13.090
TALIESIN: (laughs)

3262
02:13:13.090 --> 02:13:15.660
ASHLEY: You need to do it again. You got so close.

3263
02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:18.030
TALIESIN: It's a wonderful addition to the machine.

3264
02:13:18.030 --> 02:13:19.500
ASHLEY: God, what a great sticker.

3265
02:13:19.500 --> 02:13:20.500
TALIESIN: I know!

3266
02:13:23.127 --> 02:13:23.960
ASHLEY: Do you want Dubble Bubble,

3267
02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:24.793
or do you want Jolly Rancher?

3268
02:13:24.793 --> 02:13:26.170
TALIESIN: I always go with Dubble Bubble, personally.

3269
02:13:26.170 --> 02:13:27.003
ASHLEY: Go Dubble Bubble.

3270
02:13:27.003 --> 02:13:28.150
I'll go Jolly Rancher.

3271
02:13:28.150 --> 02:13:30.550
TALIESIN: Thank you guys so-- what?

3272
02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:33.370
BRITTANY: Hey, are you, are you guys still here?

3273
02:13:33.370 --> 02:13:35.700
Are you guys still here after last time?

3274
02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:36.890
ASHLEY: What time is it?

3275
02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:37.990
BRITTANY: Seriously, seriously, you guys know

3276
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:39.890
that being here after hours is a liability.

3277
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:41.110
TALIESIN: Did you deputize a llama?

3278
02:13:41.110 --> 02:13:42.070
ASHLEY: It's a liability?

3279
02:13:42.070 --> 02:13:44.340
BRITTANY: Yes, it's a liability, so get out. Clear out.

3280
02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:45.173
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

3281
02:13:45.173 --> 02:13:46.281
BRITTANY: Get out.

3282
02:13:46.281 --> 02:13:47.114
TALIESIN: Apparently we've been invaded by puppets.

3283
02:13:47.114 --> 02:13:48.270
This has been a wonderful MAME drop.

3284
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:49.410
ASHLEY: That's not a puppet, that's--

3285
02:13:49.410 --> 02:13:50.600
BRITTANY: You guys, you got five minutes.

3286
02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:51.433
TALIESIN: That's a critter.

3287
02:13:51.433 --> 02:13:52.540
ASHLEY: That's a, who is that?

3288
02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:53.710
BRITTANY: Get! Get!

3289
02:13:53.710 --> 02:13:56.105
ASHLEY: That was-- who was that?

3290
02:13:56.105 --> 02:13:57.645
TALIESIN: I feel like I should know that character,

3291
02:13:57.645 --> 02:13:58.620
like off the top of my head.

3292
02:14:06.898 --> 02:14:11.898
(birds chirp)

3293
02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:14.340
SAM: I'm a fan of hot air balloon rides

3294
02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:16.020
above the Venetian countryside.

3295
02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:20.540
I'm a fan of Momlan. She's always got my back.

3296
02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:24.990
I'm a fan of wine older than Taliesin.

3297
02:14:27.690 --> 02:14:29.600
I'm a fan of Twitch subscriptions.

3298
02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:35.248
I'm a fan of emotes by ArseQueef. They're neat.

3299
02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:38.790
I'm a fan of a wife so cool--

3300
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:39.870
SAM: (distorted) People forget I exist.

3301
02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:41.396
Exist.

3302
02:14:41.396 --> 02:14:42.790
(more distorted) Exist.

3303
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:45.123
(bird caws)

3304
02:14:46.922 --> 02:14:48.392
(explosion)

3305
02:14:48.392 --> 02:14:53.375
(creepy ambient sounds)

3306
02:14:53.375 --> 02:14:58.258
(creepy ambient sounds)

3307
02:14:59.199 --> 02:15:04.199
(baby cries)
(heartbeat)

3308
02:15:07.556 --> 02:15:08.462
SAM: I'm a fan of--

3309
02:15:08.462 --> 02:15:13.274
("Spring" by Vivaldi)

3310
02:15:13.274 --> 02:15:18.237
("Spring" by Vivaldi)

3311
02:15:18.237 --> 02:15:22.897
("Spring" by Vivaldi)

3312
02:15:22.897 --> 02:15:27.863
(slow rock music)

3313
02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:38.810
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back.

3314
02:27:38.810 --> 02:27:40.770
So first, we have our winner of our giveaway,

3315
02:27:40.770 --> 02:27:43.100
it is, congratulations to

3316
02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:47.610
Wombandonly.
TRAVIS: Womandonly?

3317
02:27:47.610 --> 02:27:50.240
MATT: Woman-- The Womand Only, The Womand Only?

3318
02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:54.340
The Womb and Only.

3319
02:27:55.220 --> 02:27:58.490
The Womb Man Donly.

3320
02:27:58.490 --> 02:28:00.400
There's a lot of ways this could get pronounced.

3321
02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:01.950
Anyway, congratulations. We'll get this sent

3322
02:28:01.950 --> 02:28:05.049
to you as soon as possible. (laughs)

3323
02:28:05.049 --> 02:28:06.221
ASHLEY: Just add a little accent.

3324
02:28:06.221 --> 02:28:09.010
MATT: I know, that was great.
(overlapping quiet chattering)

3325
02:28:09.010 --> 02:28:12.110
All rightly.
(overlapping quiet chattering)

3326
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:15.930
So we're back from break, is there anything else you wanted

3327
02:28:15.930 --> 02:28:19.150
to do, any other preparation? Any other deeds taken care of?

3328
02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:20.880
TALIESIN: Just for irony's sake, I was just curious

3329
02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:23.340
what happens if I lay the blade next

3330
02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:24.870
to the broken long sword. Does it auto,

3331
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:27.398
does it just, like--
MATT: Okay, so.

3332
02:28:27.398 --> 02:28:28.231
TALIESIN: I can tell when you're--

3333
02:28:28.231 --> 02:28:29.200
MATT: Take the handle and hilt--

3334
02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:31.700
what?
TALIESIN: Go ahead, carry on.

3335
02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:33.880
MATT: He does that thing.
TALIESIN: For years now.

3336
02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:35.980
MATT: I know.
TALIESIN: I'm learning.

3337
02:28:35.980 --> 02:28:37.780
MATT: You are.
TALIESIN: Trying.

3338
02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:39.530
MATT: You need to change it.
TALIESIN: I know.

3339
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.863
MATT: Have to adapt. I have to change.

3340
02:28:44.863 --> 02:28:47.540
LIAM: Four days later, I realize that Frumpkin never was

3341
02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:51.087
able to climb down from the tree, so I summon him.

3342
02:28:51.087 --> 02:28:51.920
TRAVIS: (meows)

3343
02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:54.963
(mixed meowing)

3344
02:28:54.963 --> 02:28:56.574
MATT: The neighbor's like (groaning).

3345
02:28:56.574 --> 02:28:59.043
(laughter)

3346
02:28:59.043 --> 02:29:00.149
TRAVIS: What is that noise?

3347
02:29:00.149 --> 02:29:01.435
LIAM: That den next door hates us.

3348
02:29:01.435 --> 02:29:02.610
TRAVIS: (meows)

3349
02:29:02.610 --> 02:29:05.290
ASHLEY: I actually wanted to take a peek at that sword.

3350
02:29:05.290 --> 02:29:06.990
TALIESIN: It's upstairs.
MATT: Okay.

3351
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:08.010
TALIESIN: You're up there all the time, anyway.

3352
02:29:08.010 --> 02:29:09.480
LIAM: Did you get anything from the Legend Lore?

3353
02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:11.510
TALIESIN: I don't have the money to, like--

3354
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:13.190
that's a, that's a process.

3355
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:14.959
SAM: Spent it on Sunlight for his tree instead.

3356
02:29:16.130 --> 02:29:17.410
LIAM: We'll get there.

3357
02:29:17.410 --> 02:29:18.260
TALIESIN: This is better.

3358
02:29:20.083 --> 02:29:21.190
MATT: So yeah, so you wanted to inspect it?

3359
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:22.570
ASHLEY: Just look at it, yeah.

3360
02:29:22.570 --> 02:29:23.403
MATT: Okay.

3361
02:29:24.690 --> 02:29:27.110
It's beautifully made. It is, looking at the size

3362
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:29.260
of the blade, it is a long sword.

3363
02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:30.093
ASHLEY: Okay.

3364
02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:33.050
MATT: The way it's snapped

3365
02:29:33.050 --> 02:29:37.970
or broken looks less like a stress break, and more

3366
02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:41.440
internal, like something severed it

3367
02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:44.090
from the inside of the metal, meaning

3368
02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:47.270
whatever shattered it, shattered it

3369
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:50.230
through means beyond just forceful snapping.

3370
02:29:52.430 --> 02:29:55.130
There are a number of runes across

3371
02:29:55.130 --> 02:29:57.067
each side of the blade.

3372
02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:01.190
Both parts are extremely lightweight

3373
02:30:02.330 --> 02:30:04.050
for most metals that you've dealt with,

3374
02:30:04.050 --> 02:30:05.600
and weapons that you've dealt with.

3375
02:30:07.410 --> 02:30:10.300
The actual elements of it that are designed,

3376
02:30:10.300 --> 02:30:13.670
scrolling of it, it looks almost,

3377
02:30:15.340 --> 02:30:18.070
acid marked in places,

3378
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:23.610
but it, where it looks like there's textures, and

3379
02:30:23.610 --> 02:30:27.530
has shifting in the way that the light plays off the metal,

3380
02:30:27.530 --> 02:30:30.940
that looks, at first glance, like it could be imperfect,

3381
02:30:30.940 --> 02:30:32.660
but in looking, it's all meticulously,

3382
02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:34.950
intentionally placed to be a pattern.

3383
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:39.790
So it's beautifully designed, Damascus-esque in places.

3384
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:40.817
ASHLEY: Okay.

3385
02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:43.533
Okay.

3386
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.150
MATT: Anyone else? Anything else?

3387
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:48.620
SAM: Has it been 13 days yet?

3388
02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:49.580
MATT: If you'd like to jump ahead, we can.

3389
02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:51.050
MARISHA: Well.

3390
02:30:51.050 --> 02:30:52.200
Let's have a, let's have a meeting.

3391
02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:53.033
Let's figure out the plan.
SAM: How many days

3392
02:30:53.033 --> 02:30:54.230
has it been?

3393
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:55.860
MATT: It's been, I'd say it's been about eight days.

3394
02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:56.693
You have two days out.

3395
02:30:56.693 --> 02:30:58.730
From everything you guys were preparing and doing,

3396
02:30:58.730 --> 02:31:00.860
the conversations, the shopping, it's been about eight,

3397
02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:01.900
pushing on nine days. You're about a day

3398
02:31:01.900 --> 02:31:04.990
or two away from this date.

3399
02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:06.770
MARISHA: I'd like to scout.

3400
02:31:06.770 --> 02:31:07.730
SAM: Scout what?

3401
02:31:07.730 --> 02:31:09.360
MARISHA: Scout the place.

3402
02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:12.245
SAM: Oh, like the Rusted Crow, or whatever it's called?

3403
02:31:12.245 --> 02:31:14.140
MARISHA: The Overcrow, yeah.

3404
02:31:14.140 --> 02:31:16.520
SAM: We went there once.
TALIESIN: We did.

3405
02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:19.160
SAM: We went there once.
TALIESIN: <i>We</i> did.

3406
02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:21.030
MARISHA: I wasn't with you.
SAM: Oh.

3407
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:22.130
MARISHA: I don't think.

3408
02:31:22.130 --> 02:31:25.030
ASHLEY: We just saw the interior, we didn't-- not all of it.

3409
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:26.663
I feel like we still could--

3410
02:31:26.663 --> 02:31:27.980
TALIESIN: Sparse. There was also--

3411
02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:28.813
LAURA: Mm.
TRAVIS: Overcrow.

3412
02:31:28.813 --> 02:31:31.300
LAURA: Will you look at my hair oil really fast, though?

3413
02:31:31.300 --> 02:31:32.160
Ask Yeza, too.

3414
02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:34.050
SAM: Yeza, what's in this hair oil?

3415
02:31:38.085 --> 02:31:40.410
MATT: "I have to, I have to check," and he goes

3416
02:31:40.410 --> 02:31:43.750
and uncorks it, and takes it to the alchemical station,

3417
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:45.640
and begins taking some of the elements of it,

3418
02:31:45.640 --> 02:31:46.473
and testing it with--
LAURA: Don't waste it,

3419
02:31:46.473 --> 02:31:47.380
though, because it was pretty expensive.

3420
02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:48.400
SAM: He doesn't waste anything.

3421
02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:49.550
He just needs to use a little bit.

3422
02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:50.383
MATT: "Yeah, I have to use a little bit

3423
02:31:50.383 --> 02:31:51.860
to actually test it."

3424
02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:53.350
And he goes through the process.

3425
02:31:53.350 --> 02:31:55.780
It takes about an hour or so for him to run a couple tests,

3426
02:31:55.780 --> 02:31:56.790
and then--

3427
02:31:56.790 --> 02:32:00.740
SAM: Don't micromanage my husband. He's fine.

3428
02:32:01.938 --> 02:32:05.045
(laughter)

3429
02:32:05.045 --> 02:32:08.980
MATT: He turns to you. "I'm not entirely certain what it is.

3430
02:32:08.980 --> 02:32:11.760
"It appears to be an oil derived from some sort of

3431
02:32:12.850 --> 02:32:15.920
"an organic fat, so it probably, at one point,

3432
02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:18.950
"was largely a base taken from a creature.

3433
02:32:22.050 --> 02:32:25.420
"There's nothing caustic or dangerous about it,

3434
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:29.990
"and I guess it might work as a pomade,

3435
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:31.960
"or at least a scalp oil."

3436
02:32:33.290 --> 02:32:34.220
LAURA: Nice.

3437
02:32:34.220 --> 02:32:36.980
MATT: "So it's-- you're safe to use it, I guess."

3438
02:32:36.980 --> 02:32:38.180
LAURA: Thank you so much, Yeza.

3439
02:32:38.180 --> 02:32:39.420
SAM: Thank you, Yeza. (kissing)

3440
02:32:39.420 --> 02:32:41.770
MATT: "You're welcome," and he carefully,

3441
02:32:41.770 --> 02:32:43.420
maneuvers around the teeth.

3442
02:32:44.286 --> 02:32:46.890
LAURA: You spent your time here figuring how to kiss.

3443
02:32:46.890 --> 02:32:48.860
That's great.
SAM: We almost got it.

3444
02:32:50.540 --> 02:32:51.580
Some things you don't need to kiss--

3445
02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:54.130
LAURA: I'm going to use this every night we're here.

3446
02:32:54.130 --> 02:32:55.550
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Okay.

3447
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:58.750
MATT: You guys notice, the following morning, a very, very

3448
02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:01.840
unique sheen to

3449
02:33:02.750 --> 02:33:03.590
Jester's hair.

3450
02:33:04.512 --> 02:33:07.300
♪ Simply irresistible ♪

3451
02:33:07.300 --> 02:33:11.217
MATT: It's shiny, it's full. It does carry a smell.

3452
02:33:12.993 --> 02:33:16.950
And by the second day, it's starting to just turn greasy.

3453
02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:20.358
LIAM: My, how the tables have turned.

3454
02:33:20.358 --> 02:33:22.580
(laughter)

3455
02:33:22.580 --> 02:33:24.010
LAURA: It's going to grow really fast,

3456
02:33:24.010 --> 02:33:25.910
because of the stuff, you guys.

3457
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:26.743
TALIESIN: You're looking very sharp.

3458
02:33:26.743 --> 02:33:27.861
LIAM: Do you want it to grow?

3459
02:33:27.861 --> 02:33:29.719
MARISHA: Caduceus, do you have any incense

3460
02:33:29.719 --> 02:33:32.044
or something for our room?

3461
02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:33.713
Would you mind?

3462
02:33:33.713 --> 02:33:35.850
TALIESIN: I got a little bit, actually. I do.

3463
02:33:35.850 --> 02:33:38.450
LAURA: I pull my hair up in a top knot

3464
02:33:38.450 --> 02:33:39.480
for a while, just to keep--

3465
02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:41.760
Oh, like you, Beau!

3466
02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:43.500
Look, we have Twinkie hairs now.

3467
02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:44.760
MARISHA: Yeah, just like me.

3468
02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:46.720
TRAVIS: Maybe stay away from open flames

3469
02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:48.850
for a hot second--
SAM: Or animals.

3470
02:33:48.850 --> 02:33:50.670
TRAVIS: It looks like you'll go right up.

3471
02:33:50.670 --> 02:33:52.580
LAURA: Nugget really likes me right now, though.

3472
02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:54.730
MATT: Nugget's off in the corner. (whining)

3473
02:33:54.730 --> 02:33:58.480
LAURA: Aww. What about you, Sprinkle?

3474
02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:00.466
MATT: Sprinkle's fine with it.

3475
02:34:00.466 --> 02:34:01.999
MATT: Sprinkle's rolling in it.

3476
02:34:01.999 --> 02:34:03.736
LAURA: I feel like Sprinkle's, like, dead.

3477
02:34:03.736 --> 02:34:05.690
(laughter)

3478
02:34:05.690 --> 02:34:09.280
MATT: And has been for weeks.
(laughter)

3479
02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:10.603
SAM: Drowned, burned.

3480
02:34:10.603 --> 02:34:13.131
(laughter)

3481
02:34:13.131 --> 02:34:14.447
LIAM: What do you think, Sprinkle?

3482
02:34:14.447 --> 02:34:15.505
(ghoulish voice) "I'm fine."

3483
02:34:15.505 --> 02:34:17.730
MATT: I will say--
(laughter)

3484
02:34:17.730 --> 02:34:19.980
MATT: I will say, Sprinkle does look pretty rough.

3485
02:34:20.887 --> 02:34:23.740
(noises of sympathy)

3486
02:34:23.740 --> 02:34:25.456
MATT: What started as a smiley creature

3487
02:34:25.456 --> 02:34:26.872
is now a little skittish.

3488
02:34:26.872 --> 02:34:28.828
(laughter)

3489
02:34:28.828 --> 02:34:31.311
LAURA: Oh, Matt. I scarred my Sprinkle?

3490
02:34:31.311 --> 02:34:32.902
ASHLEY: What does it smell like?

3491
02:34:32.902 --> 02:34:35.140
MATT: Right now, it smells like the pomade.

3492
02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:37.660
Sprinkles is a, Sprinkles is a tough beast,

3493
02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:39.700
but definitely is a little more world weary than

3494
02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:40.533
when you first--

3495
02:34:40.533 --> 02:34:42.250
LAURA: I put Sprinkle in the tree, and make him

3496
02:34:42.250 --> 02:34:44.960
a nice weasel nest.

3497
02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:46.284
MATT: Okay.

3498
02:34:46.284 --> 02:34:47.880
TALIESIN: What's a weasel nest?

3499
02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:49.180
Well, I mean, there's already some stuff

3500
02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:51.460
to get around in the tree. We've got some ropes--

3501
02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:53.068
MATT: You construct

3502
02:34:53.068 --> 02:34:55.268
what you assume a weasel nest would look like.

3503
02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:58.339
Make a nature check.

3504
02:34:59.922 --> 02:35:03.753
ASHLEY: It's like a hammock.

3505
02:35:03.753 --> 02:35:06.890
LAURA: This is good. Nature, three.

3506
02:35:06.890 --> 02:35:07.858
MATT: So.
(laughter)

3507
02:35:07.858 --> 02:35:09.701
TALIESIN: No! No!
(laughter)

3508
02:35:09.701 --> 02:35:14.110
MATT: You made this beautiful mud and thatch,

3509
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:19.380
like an egg hut that you place up

3510
02:35:19.380 --> 02:35:22.750
in one of the branches.
LAURA: Here, weasel.

3511
02:35:22.750 --> 02:35:26.490
Sprinkle.
(laughter)

3512
02:35:26.490 --> 02:35:28.490
MARISHA: You've forgotten his name!

3513
02:35:28.490 --> 02:35:30.480
TRAVIS: Yep, he's one step away from death.

3514
02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:32.760
LIAM: This is like-- my ten-year-old daughter collects

3515
02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:35.753
arts and crafts pieces and makes fairy houses out on

3516
02:35:35.753 --> 02:35:39.160
the trees in the back, it's just construction paper, boxes.

3517
02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:41.664
TALIESIN: One rain away from being mush.

3518
02:35:41.664 --> 02:35:42.672
MATT: Roll an animal handling check.

3519
02:35:42.672 --> 02:35:44.772
MARISHA: He has no identity anymore!

3520
02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:47.673
TRAVIS: There you go, thing.

3521
02:35:47.673 --> 02:35:49.964
(laughter)

3522
02:35:49.964 --> 02:35:51.630
MATT: So,
(laughter)

3523
02:35:51.630 --> 02:35:55.540
so, you guys hear this--

3524
02:35:55.540 --> 02:35:57.710
you hear this

3525
02:35:57.710 --> 02:36:00.670
series of squeaks from above the house.

3526
02:36:00.670 --> 02:36:03.090
You go up and check, and Jester is trying

3527
02:36:03.090 --> 02:36:04.860
to force this weasel into the house

3528
02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:06.819
that she worked so hard to make.

3529
02:36:06.819 --> 02:36:07.885
LAURA: You'll like it.

3530
02:36:07.885 --> 02:36:11.190
MATT: (unhappy squeaking)

3531
02:36:11.190 --> 02:36:13.740
Until eventually (thunk) gets him inside of it.

3532
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:18.288
LAURA: Do you like it in there?
MATT: (angry chatter)

3533
02:36:18.288 --> 02:36:20.871
(laughter)

3534
02:36:22.901 --> 02:36:26.950
LIAM: It's definitely the dragon's first weasel hut.

3535
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:28.550
MATT: The big bad has been revealed.

3536
02:36:29.597 --> 02:36:31.117
(laughter)

3537
02:36:31.117 --> 02:36:33.576
TRAVIS: It will have its revenge.

3538
02:36:33.576 --> 02:36:36.017
TALIESIN: Ow. Ow.
LAURA: I catch some of the--

3539
02:36:36.017 --> 02:36:38.558
What do weasels eat?

3540
02:36:38.558 --> 02:36:40.403
I still don't know what weasels eat.

3541
02:36:40.403 --> 02:36:42.836
TALIESIN: Make an animal handling check!

3542
02:36:42.836 --> 02:36:45.520
LAURA: Would I have known if I had figured it out by now?

3543
02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:47.920
MATT: By your nature check you made earlier--

3544
02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:48.753
TRAVIS: Nope.

3545
02:36:48.753 --> 02:36:50.410
MATT: It doesn't seem to be liking leaves.

3546
02:36:50.410 --> 02:36:52.385
LAURA: No, I'm going to catch some rats

3547
02:36:52.385 --> 02:36:53.720
down in the basement,

3548
02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:55.760
and I'm going to try to feed him that.

3549
02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:56.593
LIAM: Jeez, cannibalism.

3550
02:36:56.593 --> 02:36:58.950
MATT: Okay, you throw some rats in there.

3551
02:37:00.346 --> 02:37:03.073
TRAVIS: Rats are half the size of it.

3552
02:37:03.073 --> 02:37:04.664
LAURA: I gave him little chunks of rat!

3553
02:37:04.664 --> 02:37:07.810
TRAVIS: You're literally throwing some cousins in there.

3554
02:37:07.810 --> 02:37:10.540
LAURA: I give him some rat chunks.

3555
02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:12.823
Then I'll try some bugs next.

3556
02:37:12.823 --> 02:37:15.303
TRAVIS: Here, human, eat this teenager.

3557
02:37:15.303 --> 02:37:18.140
(laughter)

3558
02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:21.430
You must be hungry, here's a leg.

LIAM: Chop, chop, chop, chop. Foomph, foomph, foomph.

3560
02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:27.640
TRAVIS: Holy fuck.

3561
02:37:30.005 --> 02:37:33.126
MATT: ♪ Tell me, is it good, sir, it's too good, at least ♪

MARISHA: Holy shit. Dying.

3566
02:37:40.942 --> 02:37:41.799
MATT: We'll say--

3567
02:37:41.799 --> 02:37:43.940
LAURA: Oh, big prey or mammals, rabbit size or smaller.

3568
02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:46.770
Fuck you guys, he would love the rats.

3569

TRAVIS: Fuck you, you're cool,

3578
02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:06.710
This is real D&amp;D, guys.

3580
02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:12.770
skittish and reserved,

3581
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:16.730
in a strange land after some wild adventures,

3582
02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:19.990
Sprinkle has been forced into an uncomfortable home,

3583
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:22.250
and is staying there for the time being.

3584
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:24.300
Eventually, you do hear some eating sounds,

3585
02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:26.210
out of necessity.

3586
02:38:26.210 --> 02:38:30.324
TRAVIS: Sobbing. (crying)

3587
02:38:30.324 --> 02:38:31.290
LAURA: You don't have to stay in there,

3588
02:38:31.290 --> 02:38:32.900
I just thought you would like it,

3589
02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:35.900
but if you don't like it, you can come on out any time.

3590
02:38:38.212 --> 02:38:39.650
MATT: (chewing)

3591
02:38:39.650 --> 02:38:41.390
LAURA: I think he's really mad at me.

3592
02:38:41.390 --> 02:38:42.750
SAM: That's okay, give him some time,

3593
02:38:42.750 --> 02:38:45.310
he just needs to blow off some steam.

3594
02:38:45.310 --> 02:38:46.990
TALIESIN: She knows you're really mad.

3595
02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:49.240
That's okay, you stay up there as long as you need.

3596
02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:51.290
LAURA: Yeah, help me out, Caduceus, okay?

3597
02:38:51.290 --> 02:38:52.123
TALIESIN: I just did.

3598
02:38:52.123 --> 02:38:54.320
ASHLEY: Maybe he's starting to like it.

3599
02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:56.337
SAM: Yeah!
TALIESIN: Well.

3600
02:38:56.337 --> 02:38:58.780
(laughter)

3601
02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:00.210
SAM: It's a tree house tree house.

3602
02:39:00.210 --> 02:39:02.850
MATT: All righty. (laughs)

3603
02:39:02.850 --> 02:39:06.437
So well done. (laughs)

3604
02:39:06.437 --> 02:39:07.320
SAM: All right, what's our plan?

3605
02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:08.510
MARISHA: We need a plan.

3606
02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:09.350
TALIESIN: There was a--

3607
02:39:09.350 --> 02:39:11.150
LIAM: Let's go to the war room.

3608
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:14.933
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah, let's go to our war room.

3609
02:39:14.933 --> 02:39:15.766
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

3610
02:39:15.766 --> 02:39:17.580
MATT: You guys travel to your war room,

3611
02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:20.200
which has a table and chairs, that's it,

3612
02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:23.080
the walls are still plain, that is your war room.

3613
02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:24.630
MARISHA: We need to decorate the war room.

3614
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:27.200
LAURA: Just tell me what you want, just tell me.

3615
02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:29.390
SAM: Let's focus on the war

3616
02:39:29.390 --> 02:39:31.160
and not on the room.

3617
02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:34.360
So are we going to stake it out

3618
02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:36.450
for another four days? At some point,

3619
02:39:36.450 --> 02:39:38.310
I would like to reconnect my husband

3620
02:39:38.310 --> 02:39:40.770
with our son, or possibly--

3621
02:39:42.250 --> 02:39:45.020
We all made this trip,

3622
02:39:45.020 --> 02:39:47.950
how far was Alfield from Nicodranas?

3623
02:39:47.950 --> 02:39:48.880
LAURA: A couple weeks.

3624
02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:50.680
SAM: Oh, fuck, all right. (laughs)

3625
02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:53.110
LAURA: Right, or is it a week?

3626
02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:55.810
MATT: Nicodranas to Alfield, I'd say you're looking at

3627
02:39:55.810 --> 02:39:58.140
about a week, at least, of travel,

3628
02:39:58.140 --> 02:40:00.340
if it's constant, on horseback.

3629
02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:02.240
LAURA: If it's an old lady and a kid?

3630
02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:03.692
MATT: If it's a little more casual,

3631
02:40:03.692 --> 02:40:05.650
you're looking at a week and a half, maybe.

3632
02:40:05.650 --> 02:40:07.410
TRAVIS: Could we send some money to the Golden Chain gang

3633
02:40:07.410 --> 02:40:09.830
to go up and escort them down or something?

3634
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:11.430
SAM: The mercenaries you were talking about?

3635
02:40:11.430 --> 02:40:14.160
TRAVIS: Yeah. (burps)

3636
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:15.740
SAM: No.

3637
02:40:15.740 --> 02:40:16.910
What?
TRAVIS: Why?

3638
02:40:16.910 --> 02:40:19.120
SAM: But they seem

3639
02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:22.420
ill-suited for escorting a child.

3640
02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:24.110
TRAVIS: I thought they were guardians and protectors--

3641
02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:25.090
LAURA: Yeah, they're guardians.

3642
02:40:25.090 --> 02:40:28.280
SAM: But aren't they the elite hit men force?

3643
02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:30.360
MARISHA: Exactly why they're the best babysitters,

3644
02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:33.090
I don't know why you're fighting this.

3645
02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:37.090
TRAVIS: A bear comes up. Ka-bam!

3646
02:40:37.090 --> 02:40:41.712
MARISHA: Assassin comes up. (slashing)

3647
02:40:41.712 --> 02:40:43.090
SAM: All right, I have 100 gold.

3648
02:40:43.090 --> 02:40:45.250
LAURA: Oh, I think they cost more than that.

3649
02:40:45.250 --> 02:40:47.740
I don't know for sure, but Fjord would probably know.

3650
02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:49.300
We could pop

3651
02:40:49.300 --> 02:40:53.410
Yeza over to Nicodranas,

3652
02:40:53.410 --> 02:40:56.030
and then he can be there and hire people,

3653
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:59.010
and then the people can travel with him up

3654
02:40:59.010 --> 02:41:02.700
to Alfield, and get Luc, and then they can go back down

3655
02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:05.008
to Nicodranas and live with my mama.

3656
02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:09.550
SAM: I would not feel comfortable sending Yeza

3657
02:41:09.550 --> 02:41:11.390
on that journey alone.

3658
02:41:11.390 --> 02:41:12.730
LIAM: What is your ultimate goal, though,

3659
02:41:12.730 --> 02:41:15.530
would you prefer that your husband and son--

3660
02:41:15.530 --> 02:41:16.790
SAM: To reunite my family.

3661
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:18.940
LIAM: I know that, the next part of the question is,

3662
02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:21.350
would you prefer they live here, in this home,

3663
02:41:21.350 --> 02:41:24.270
or in Nicodranas, with Jester's mother, or where?

3664
02:41:26.307 --> 02:41:27.948
LAURA: I would think outside of the Empire

3665
02:41:27.948 --> 02:41:29.114
is probably better.

3666
02:41:29.114 --> 02:41:31.605
SAM: Probably with your mother

3667
02:41:31.605 --> 02:41:33.660
is the safest place I can think

3668
02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:35.670
of for right now.

3669
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:36.550
TALIESIN: A wise course of action.

3670
02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:39.010
LIAM: What if we reached out to Bryce for her advice,

3671
02:41:39.868 --> 02:41:41.670
in hiring someone?
MATT: For their advice?

3672
02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:43.130
LAURA: For their advice?

3673
02:41:43.130 --> 02:41:45.211
LIAM: Yes, thank you.

3674
02:41:45.211 --> 02:41:46.044
TALIESIN: Do we have--

3675
02:41:46.044 --> 02:41:48.285
oh, of course we have the ability to do that,

3676
02:41:48.285 --> 02:41:49.850
that's a thing--

3677
02:41:49.850 --> 02:41:52.200
LIAM: I mean, they have a level head on their shoulders,

3678
02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:56.190
they're not cutthroat mercenaries.

3679
02:41:56.190 --> 02:41:58.840
MARISHA: And we for sure know that your son has made it

3680
02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:01.100
to Alfield?
SAM: Yeah, we checked in.

3681
02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:03.490
MARISHA: Yeah, why wouldn't Bryce want to help us?

3682
02:42:03.490 --> 02:42:05.520
SAM: Because they have a war to fight?

3683
02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:07.363
MARISHA: Yeah.

3684
02:42:07.363 --> 02:42:09.860
LIAM: Well, it, it's not a sure thing, but it's a good lead.

3685
02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:12.965
SAM: We could.

3686
02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:16.220
LAURA: Hold on, I'll send a message.

3687
02:42:16.220 --> 02:42:17.053
SAM: Oh, boy.

3688
02:42:17.053 --> 02:42:20.110
LAURA: Hey-oh, Bryce, it's us.

3689
02:42:20.110 --> 02:42:22.800
Hey, you know the kid and the old lady?

3690
02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:26.250
Could you maybe take them down to Nicodranas, maybe?

3691
02:42:26.250 --> 02:42:28.540
SAM: How much would it cost?
LAURA: How much would it cost?

3692
02:42:30.570 --> 02:42:32.690
MATT: "Hello, huh.

3693
02:42:32.690 --> 02:42:35.250
"Yes, I am watching over them.

3694
02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:37.713
"Things are

3695
02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:43.410
"tense.

3696
02:42:43.410 --> 02:42:45.525
"I have responsibilities.

3697
02:42:46.850 --> 02:42:51.300
"I could send them south."

3698
02:42:52.250 --> 02:42:54.840
LAURA: Ew, Bryce is busy.

3699
02:42:56.220 --> 02:42:58.940
But they could send them south.

3700
02:42:58.940 --> 02:43:01.390
LIAM: Yeah, you asked how much, and they did not,

3701
02:43:01.390 --> 02:43:03.270
did they reply to that?

3702
02:43:03.270 --> 02:43:04.410
LAURA: No.
LIAM: No.

3703
02:43:04.410 --> 02:43:06.360
MARISHA: Did Bryce have any recommendations,

3704
02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:07.790
people that they might know?

3705
02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:10.240
SAM: Very, very short message.

3706
02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:11.730
LAURA: Yeah.

3707
02:43:11.730 --> 02:43:13.505
TALIESIN: I assume that those sorts of things

3708
02:43:13.505 --> 02:43:14.663
could be taken care of

3709
02:43:14.663 --> 02:43:17.730
if we decide that that's the best course of action.

3710
02:43:17.730 --> 02:43:18.580
SAM: I don't think--

3711
02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:19.828
TALIESIN: I don't think we would have to know

3712
02:43:19.828 --> 02:43:21.203
the particulars. In fact, if anything,

3713
02:43:21.203 --> 02:43:23.170
not knowing the particulars might be--

3714
02:43:23.170 --> 02:43:24.760
SAM: No, I would want to know the particulars.

3715
02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:26.970
I mean, we made this trip ourselves,

3716
02:43:26.970 --> 02:43:29.330
and nearly died several times.

3717
02:43:31.380 --> 02:43:33.240
LAURA: Not on that little part, though.

3718
02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:35.740
SAM: To get into Nicodranas out of the Empire

3719
02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:39.040
was very hard. We had to go through the gate,

3720
02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:40.670
and prove who we were, the--

3721
02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:43.700
LAURA: Yeah, we did fight those two-headed people.

3722
02:43:43.700 --> 02:43:45.981
SAM: We got ambushed at some point.

3723
02:43:47.409 --> 02:43:48.320
TALIESIN: We weren't caravan-ing, though,

3724
02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:49.780
I mean, that's the whole point of caravan.

3725
02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:51.090
MARISHA: We also brought three pets,

3726
02:43:51.090 --> 02:43:53.410
and two of them are still with us.

3727
02:43:53.410 --> 02:43:54.950
LAURA: Oh, poor Professor Thaddeus,

3728
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:56.400
I hope he's living his best life.

3729
02:43:56.400 --> 02:43:58.050
TRAVIS: Yeah, that bird was a shithead.

3730
02:43:59.019 --> 02:44:00.330
MARISHA: Fuck him,

3731
02:44:00.330 --> 02:44:01.555
he broke my heart.
TRAVIS: Out eating mice,

3732
02:44:01.555 --> 02:44:02.690
living his best life, get out of here.

3733
02:44:02.690 --> 02:44:04.928
TALIESIN: I'd like to scry on the bird, sorry.

3734
02:44:04.928 --> 02:44:07.111
(laughter)

3735
02:44:07.111 --> 02:44:09.059
Not yet, not yet.

3736
02:44:09.059 --> 02:44:11.810
MARISHA: One day, we're going to do that,

3737
02:44:11.810 --> 02:44:14.210
I want to know what that piece of shit is up to.

3738
02:44:15.989 --> 02:44:19.790
LIAM: We have four days, so part of that, I think,

3739
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:22.250
Beauregard, you're correct, we want to scout out the place,

3740
02:44:22.250 --> 02:44:23.810
and figure out how we're going to handle that.

3741
02:44:23.810 --> 02:44:26.810
But we have a handful of days where we could

3742
02:44:26.810 --> 02:44:31.130
conceivably bring Yeza to Nicodranas,

3743
02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:36.102
visit your mother, hire someone, someone that we choose,

3744
02:44:37.130 --> 02:44:40.410
jump back, set it in motion, and then Yeza--

3745
02:44:41.902 --> 02:44:44.850
we have to trust Yeza to, I don't know--

3746
02:44:44.850 --> 02:44:47.990
LAURA: He's a big halfling, he can take care of himself.

3747
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:49.973
SAM: He's actually below average size.

3748
02:44:49.973 --> 02:44:51.260
LAURA: Oh.

3749
02:44:51.260 --> 02:44:54.130
LIAM: Very skilled, though.

3750
02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:56.950
Or we wait.
SAM: That sounds crazy--

3751
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:58.930
LIAM: It's maybe your call. Do you want to wait until

3752
02:44:58.930 --> 02:45:01.890
after we figure this out in four days?

3753
02:45:01.890 --> 02:45:02.850
TALIESIN: I feel like maybe you're looking

3754
02:45:02.850 --> 02:45:04.180
for an option that doesn't exist.

3755
02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:07.238
SAM: I think, yeah, I think you're right, Mr. Clay.

3756
02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:12.840
I don't think I would feel comfortable sending,

3757
02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:16.500
I mean, Yeza, do you, do you think you would be able

3758
02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:19.700
to go with a bunch of sell-swords up to--

3759
02:45:20.670 --> 02:45:24.090
LAURA: Not a bunch, just like one, they're really expensive.

3760
02:45:24.090 --> 02:45:26.560
SAM: With one sell-sword up to get our son?

3761
02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:28.650
LIAM: Or maybe travel with some merchants or something.

3762
02:45:28.650 --> 02:45:30.850
MARISHA: Or a caravan.
LIAM: Yeah, a caravan.

3763
02:45:30.850 --> 02:45:33.273
MATT: "I mean, I can definitely ride along,

3764
02:45:33.273 --> 02:45:34.670
"I probably need a little bit of guidance

3765
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:37.870
"on how best to do that, I've not--"

3766
02:45:37.870 --> 02:45:38.703
SAM: You haven't been to Alfield.

3767
02:45:38.703 --> 02:45:40.180
MATT: "I haven't really traveled--"

3768
02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:43.330
"much. I kind of grew up in Felderwin, so."

3769
02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:47.080
MARISHA: Well, if he's with a group, moving to Alfield,

3770
02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:49.740
he won't have to know where Alfield is,

3771
02:45:49.740 --> 02:45:52.737
he just has to look for his son once he gets there.

3772
02:45:52.737 --> 02:45:53.570
LIAM: Yeah, keep his head down--

3773
02:45:53.570 --> 02:45:55.680
MARISHA: Also--
SAM: I could go with him.

3774
02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:58.520
MARISHA: If we want--

3775
02:45:58.520 --> 02:45:59.470
SAM: I would trust me.

3776
02:46:00.930 --> 02:46:03.090
MARISHA: But then you'd be gone for a bit.

3777
02:46:03.090 --> 02:46:04.520
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Nott!

3778
02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:05.670
SAM: But just for a bit.

3779
02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:09.260
LAURA: What if you get to your family, and you're like,

3780
02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:10.350
love them, and that--

3781
02:46:10.350 --> 02:46:12.470
SAM: That is absolutely going to happen.

3782
02:46:13.530 --> 02:46:14.363
LAURA: No.

3783
02:46:14.363 --> 02:46:16.087
MARISHA: Do you want to go home, Nott?

3784
02:46:16.927 --> 02:46:17.950
LAURA: I mean.

3785
02:46:17.950 --> 02:46:22.950
SAM: I don't, yes, of course I want to go home,

3786
02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:25.373
but I can't go home right now.

3787
02:46:25.373 --> 02:46:28.080
LIAM: There's maybe not a home to go to at the moment.

3788
02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:32.020
MARISHA: We could split up the party for a little bit.

3789
02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:34.980
You and Caleb and maybe a couple others can go

3790
02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:36.520
to Nicodranas, find

3791
02:46:37.970 --> 02:46:39.310
a group

3792
02:46:39.310 --> 02:46:41.050
to send Yeza up with,

3793
02:46:41.050 --> 02:46:43.948
and the rest of us can stake out the place here--

3794
02:46:43.948 --> 02:46:47.200
SAM: How about this, rather than plotting all of our,

3795
02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:49.500
all of us splitting up, we do have a day or two.

3796
02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:52.350
Maybe, maybe we could test your new spell,

3797
02:46:52.350 --> 02:46:54.633
your new teleport-y spell,

3798
02:46:55.500 --> 02:46:59.422
we could go see the wizard there,

3799
02:46:59.422 --> 02:47:01.900
and maybe he can teleport us to Alfield.

3800
02:47:01.900 --> 02:47:04.160
I don't know, maybe he has that power.

3801
02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:05.880
LIAM: Maybe, that's a big maybe.

3802
02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:08.330
TALIESIN: That's a very big maybe, especially in the middle

3803
02:47:08.330 --> 02:47:11.370
of all this.
LIAM: My relationship with him is

3804
02:47:11.370 --> 02:47:12.730
improvised, at best.

3805
02:47:12.730 --> 02:47:15.238
MARISHA: Alfield was a pretty podunk town.

3806
02:47:15.238 --> 02:47:17.238
TALIESIN: Probably a little strained at this point.

3807
02:47:17.238 --> 02:47:18.550
MARISHA: Also, once you get to Alfield,

3808
02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:20.090
it doesn't mean that Alfield is going

3809
02:47:20.090 --> 02:47:23.970
to have a teleportation circle back to Rosohna.

3810
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:26.857
TALIESIN: Doubt it will.
SAM: I don't know how that works.

3811
02:47:26.857 --> 02:47:27.760
Yeah.

3812
02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:31.291
TALIESIN: This is a month

3813
02:47:31.291 --> 02:47:32.820
to do this.

3814
02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:36.198
With no guarantee it'll go well.

3815
02:47:37.860 --> 02:47:40.560
MATT: "Whatever seems best for you, whatever you guys want."

3816
02:47:42.499 --> 02:47:45.390
TALIESIN: I think,

3817
02:47:45.390 --> 02:47:48.390
if it were me, I would arrange

3818
02:47:49.270 --> 02:47:53.220
a way to get your children south, and not try

3819
02:47:53.220 --> 02:47:57.300
and cross a border twice, and then--

3820
02:47:57.300 --> 02:47:59.530
LAURA: The border's ready well-guarded.

3821
02:47:59.530 --> 02:48:03.030
TALIESIN: One crossing, and then have everyone reunite

3822
02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:06.540
south, away from all of this.

3823
02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:09.770
MATT: "I will say it's probably easier to leave the border,

3824
02:48:09.770 --> 02:48:11.892
"than to get in."
LAURA: Yeah.

3825
02:48:13.879 --> 02:48:17.720
LIAM: I wonder.

3826
02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:19.120
I wonder if

3827
02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:20.230
Essek

3828
02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:23.560
or someone here would be willing

3829
02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:26.960
to send even just a couple of us,

3830
02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:29.670
maybe all of us, but even if it was just a few of us,

3831
02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:32.910
to Alfield.

3832
02:48:32.910 --> 02:48:34.870
I could get us to Nicodranas.

3833
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:36.864
SAM: How would Essek do that?

3834
02:48:36.864 --> 02:48:39.440
LIAM: Well, I'm not the only person in the world

3835
02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:42.290
who knows how to jump across the continents.

3836
02:48:42.290 --> 02:48:44.180
If someone here could send us,

3837
02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:48.400
we could go to your boy, then I could take us

3838
02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:52.498
to Nicodranas from anywhere. Then we'll jump back.

3839
02:48:52.498 --> 02:48:53.800
TRAVIS: We don't even have to go straight to Alfield,

3840
02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:56.910
just if there's a transportation circle close to there.

3841
02:48:56.910 --> 02:48:59.250
MARISHA: But Caleb, how does that work?

3842
02:48:59.250 --> 02:49:01.290
LIAM: I don't know, what I,

3843
02:49:01.290 --> 02:49:03.540
what I am capable of doing is tied

3844
02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:07.280
to very specific locked locations, but--

3845
02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:08.923
LAURA: And if they had the ability to do that,

3846
02:49:08.923 --> 02:49:10.790
call me crazy.
TRAVIS: Crazy.

3847
02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:14.020
LAURA: Wouldn't they have done it

3848
02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:14.970
when they were, you know,

3849
02:49:14.970 --> 02:49:16.203
attacking the Empire?

3850
02:49:16.203 --> 02:49:18.720
SAM: Yeah, rather than going in with tunnels and stuff.

3851
02:49:19.950 --> 02:49:21.310
MARISHA: I feel like just because you can get

3852
02:49:21.310 --> 02:49:24.550
to Nicodranas doesn't mean that you can get back

3853
02:49:25.420 --> 02:49:27.650
here.
LIAM: I can, actually.

3854
02:49:27.650 --> 02:49:28.841
MARISHA: You can?
LIAM: Yeah.

3855
02:49:28.841 --> 02:49:29.830
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

3856
02:49:29.830 --> 02:49:31.460
TALIESIN: But also,

3857
02:49:31.460 --> 02:49:34.690
I don't know, this--
MARISHA: Sure.

3858
02:49:34.690 --> 02:49:38.560
LIAM: The problem is Alfield, getting to Alfield quickly.

3859
02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:40.610
TALIESIN: I'm still of the opinion we don't need

3860
02:49:40.610 --> 02:49:43.370
to necessarily get to Alfield.

3861
02:49:43.370 --> 02:49:45.380
I don't see what's wrong with just--

3862
02:49:45.380 --> 02:49:48.660
SAM: Sending a five-year-old boy halfway across the

3863
02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:51.068
continent, with no one that we know,

3864
02:49:51.068 --> 02:49:52.193
I see a big problem with that.

3865
02:49:52.193 --> 02:49:54.930
I can't do it, I'm sorry.
LIAM: Yes, Mr. Clay,

3866
02:49:54.930 --> 02:49:56.910
we are just not sure about

3867
02:49:58.090 --> 02:50:00.670
the speed of this--
TALIESIN: I didn't say no one

3868
02:50:00.670 --> 02:50:03.150
that you know.
MATT: "Well, I mean, it.

3869
02:50:05.490 --> 02:50:07.540
"We know, we know that Luc is safe, right?"

3870
02:50:07.540 --> 02:50:10.080
SAM: Yeah, right where he is.
MATT: "And Edith, right?"

3871
02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:10.913
SAM: Yeah.

3872
02:50:10.913 --> 02:50:12.830
MATT: "And this seems to be at least one

3873
02:50:12.830 --> 02:50:14.050
"of the areas furthest from

3874
02:50:14.050 --> 02:50:16.020
"where all this war stuff's happening.

3875
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:19.710
"I can stay here a little longer.

3876
02:50:19.710 --> 02:50:21.550
"You have a nicer place to stay than where we were at.

3877
02:50:21.550 --> 02:50:24.880
"I don't want you guys all messing up your

3878
02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:27.130
"plans and everything,

3879
02:50:27.130 --> 02:50:29.320
"just to get me out there, I."

3880
02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:33.000
TALIESIN: We do have friends that we could contact,

3881
02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:34.190
and at some point--

3882
02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:35.418
MATT: "I can clean up the place a bit,

3883
02:50:35.418 --> 02:50:38.100
"while you guys are off. I can just try and straighten up,

3884
02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:40.880
"and make myself useful, you know?"

3885
02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:43.730
MARISHA: I think we should be realistic about what

3886
02:50:43.730 --> 02:50:45.796
we're about to jump into.

3887
02:50:45.796 --> 02:50:46.771
LIAM: Well, let's flip things,

3888
02:50:46.771 --> 02:50:49.530
then, let's focus on this place.

3889
02:50:49.530 --> 02:50:51.450
SAM: On the task at hand.
LIAM: Yes, on the task at hand.

3890
02:50:51.450 --> 02:50:53.560
And in the meantime, perhaps I can

3891
02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:57.020
speak with the powers that be here,

3892
02:50:57.020 --> 02:51:01.830
and maybe get some of us, or all of us passage to Alfield.

3893
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:04.490
If we can get a one way ticket to Alfield,

3894
02:51:04.490 --> 02:51:06.230
I can bring the boy back here.

3895
02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:08.230
If the boy is here, he can live here,

3896
02:51:08.230 --> 02:51:11.140
or we can bring all of you to Nicodranas.

3897
02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:15.080
Are you looking at penises right now?

3898
02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:17.010
SAM: No, I was remembering, no,

3899
02:51:17.010 --> 02:51:18.510
I think you're absolutely right.

3900
02:51:18.510 --> 02:51:20.850
I was just remembering, we do have one other friend

3901
02:51:20.850 --> 02:51:24.260
in Alfield that I would trust.

3902
02:51:24.260 --> 02:51:25.896
LIAM: Remind us?
SAM: Shakäste.

3903
02:51:25.896 --> 02:51:26.729
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

3904
02:51:27.832 --> 02:51:30.057
TRAVIS: Uh!

3905
02:51:31.450 --> 02:51:36.010
SAM: But for now, let's just focus on the, whatever,

3906
02:51:36.010 --> 02:51:39.080
where are we going in three days?

3907
02:51:39.080 --> 02:51:41.320
TALIESIN: Well, I should also mention that

3908
02:51:41.320 --> 02:51:42.670
when we did see the place,

3909
02:51:42.670 --> 02:51:46.550
and I don't know why I keep getting off track,

3910
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:49.610
there was a weird magical glow coming

3911
02:51:49.610 --> 02:51:51.300
from the back.

3912
02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:53.470
MARISHA: What was this place, you all haven't told me.

3913
02:51:53.470 --> 02:51:55.653
LAURA: Oh. It was a shopped owned by a gobliness

3914
02:51:55.653 --> 02:51:58.010
where I got my hair stuff.
TALIESIN: "Shop" is a really,

3915
02:51:58.010 --> 02:52:00.590
is practically a--
TRAVIS: I wouldn't touch it, Jester.

3916
02:52:00.590 --> 02:52:03.262
TALIESIN: Oh, god.
TRAVIS: It's all fucking gross.

3917
02:52:03.262 --> 02:52:04.170
TALIESIN: It's okay. Here.

3918
02:52:04.170 --> 02:52:05.853
LIAM: The Overcrow.
LAURA: Thanks.

3919
02:52:05.853 --> 02:52:07.279
LIAM: The Overcrow.
TALIESIN: Yeah,

3920
02:52:07.279 --> 02:52:08.120
that's okay, just keep going a little bit.

3921
02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:10.240
LAURA: Thanks, Caduceus.
LIAM: Yeah, that's it, isn't it?

3922
02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:12.300
MATT: The Overcrow Apothecary, yes.

3923
02:52:12.300 --> 02:52:14.300
MARISHA: It's an apothecary?

3924
02:52:14.300 --> 02:52:15.940
TALIESIN: It felt a little thin.

3925
02:52:17.873 --> 02:52:18.950
It didn't have a lot of stock,

3926
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:21.100
and was definitely a bit of a mess.

3927
02:52:21.100 --> 02:52:22.940
LIAM: Well, it might just be a front, some kind of--

3928
02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:24.347
SAM: Do you want to distract the--

3929
02:52:24.347 --> 02:52:27.872
TALIESIN: There was a magic aura coming from the back.

3930
02:52:27.872 --> 02:52:29.960
SAM: Do you want to distract the shopkeeper while we

3931
02:52:30.870 --> 02:52:32.770
snoop around in the back or something?

3932
02:52:34.115 --> 02:52:35.915
LAURA: The shopkeeper really liked Fjord.

3933
02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:38.540
SAM: Who doesn't?

3934
02:52:38.540 --> 02:52:40.590
TALIESIN: That's true, the shopkeeper did really like Fjord.

3935
02:52:40.590 --> 02:52:43.760
SAM: He's 130 lean pounds of hot.

3936
02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:45.880
TRAVIS: Okay, add 45,

3937
02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:47.130
no, 60,

3938
02:52:47.130 --> 02:52:48.550
then 95,

3939
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:51.670
yeah, I'll distract her, okay, it's not a problem.

3940
02:52:51.670 --> 02:52:52.853
I can do that.

3941
02:52:52.853 --> 02:52:54.480
MARISHA: Do you know if they had a back entrance?

3942
02:52:55.700 --> 02:52:56.970
LAURA: The goblin, or the--

3943
02:52:56.970 --> 02:52:58.240
MARISHA: The apothecary.

3944
02:52:58.240 --> 02:52:59.880
What?

3945
02:52:59.880 --> 02:53:01.000
What?

3946
02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:02.780
MATT: You didn't really check--

3947
02:53:02.780 --> 02:53:05.113
TALIESIN: We didn't do a full circle of the place, did we?

3948
02:53:05.113 --> 02:53:06.850
LAURA: Mm-mm.

3949
02:53:06.850 --> 02:53:10.030
But there is an upstairs, the goblin lives upstairs.

3950
02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:11.970
MARISHA: We could break in at night.

3951
02:53:11.970 --> 02:53:13.770
SAM: Yep, yep, yep.
LIAM: Yeah.

3952
02:53:13.770 --> 02:53:15.590
You can sneaky sneak, a couple of us

3953
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:17.140
can hide ourselves from vision.

3954
02:53:18.270 --> 02:53:20.270
TALIESIN: Well, I'm a little iffy on that, but.

3955
02:53:20.270 --> 02:53:21.200
LIAM: Oh, yeah?

3956
02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:23.180
TALIESIN: I can do it for a second, I can do it

3957
02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:24.650
for a little while, but I'm not, like.

3958
02:53:24.650 --> 02:53:27.857
LAURA: I could do it, I could do it for ten seconds.

3959
02:53:27.857 --> 02:53:28.690
LIAM: Ten seconds?

3960
02:53:28.690 --> 02:53:30.800
TALIESIN: About ten seconds.
LIAM: Well. Hmm.

3961
02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:32.780
SAM: I could sneaky sneak in--
LIAM: You can sneaky sneak.

3962
02:53:32.780 --> 02:53:35.540
SAM: That's about it. Let's go do it!

3963
02:53:35.540 --> 02:53:36.900
What time is it?

3964
02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:39.366
Hey, look, it's nighttime every day.

3965
02:53:39.366 --> 02:53:41.080
(laughter)

3966
02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:43.230
TALIESIN: We'll wait until the sun goes, never mind.

3967
02:53:44.290 --> 02:53:45.880
MATT: All right, so what's the plan?

3968
02:53:45.880 --> 02:53:46.713
LIAM: It is--

3969
02:53:48.170 --> 02:53:49.730
MATT: You're on the,

3970
02:53:51.360 --> 02:53:53.930
I'd say 11th day.

3971
02:53:53.930 --> 02:53:56.750
13 days is when this is supposed to happen on Grissen.

3972
02:53:56.750 --> 02:54:00.343
TALIESIN: You've got a cat, too.

3973
02:54:00.343 --> 02:54:02.330
MATT: Well, I'm saying also that the time it took you guys

3974
02:54:02.330 --> 02:54:04.120
to set all this stuff up was a week and a half,

3975
02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:06.920
so you're looking at about ten days, 11 days

3976
02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:10.300
of this process, so you have about two,

3977
02:54:10.300 --> 02:54:11.133
a little over two days.

3978
02:54:11.133 --> 02:54:12.340
TALIESIN: Did we tell the powers that be

3979
02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:14.300
that we found another device, or was that not--

3980
02:54:14.300 --> 02:54:15.750
MARISHA: No.
TALIESIN: Or did that not get brought up?

3981
02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:17.150
MATT: No, you found...

3982
02:54:17.150 --> 02:54:19.620
the device and the cloth piece, you kept to yourselves.

3983
02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:23.520
MARISHA: There is also a recurring theme with apothecaries.

3984
02:54:24.690 --> 02:54:28.730
TALIESIN: Do we want to--
MARISHA: Your, Yeza's husband.

3985
02:54:28.730 --> 02:54:29.563
SAM: Yes?

3986
02:54:29.563 --> 02:54:32.686
MARISHA: Their apothecary got targeted.

3987
02:54:32.686 --> 02:54:34.240
SAM: Oh!

3988
02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:36.540
LIAM: Why don't we hold onto our information,

3989
02:54:36.540 --> 02:54:37.660
just for a couple of more days.

3990
02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:38.630
TALIESIN: Trust your opinions--

3991
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:40.220
MARISHA: No, I don't want to tell anyone this shit.

3992
02:54:40.220 --> 02:54:42.690
LIAM: See what we learn in two days.

3993
02:54:42.690 --> 02:54:43.523
MARISHA: I'm really curious as to

3994
02:54:43.523 --> 02:54:45.198
who this blonde haired man is.

3995
02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:50.970
And if, especially now that we're only 13 days out,

3996
02:54:50.970 --> 02:54:53.320
I'm curious if he's already in the city.

3997
02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:55.280
LAURA: I could scry on him again tonight.

3998
02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:56.810
MARISHA: Let's do it.
LIAM: Yeah.

3999
02:54:56.810 --> 02:55:01.270
TALIESIN: Maybe send a cat in for recon, Caleb?

4000
02:55:02.168 --> 02:55:03.670
LIAM: A cat, yeah, yeah.

4001
02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:05.670
MATT: So what's the plan, what are we doing?

4002
02:55:06.660 --> 02:55:07.900
TRAVIS: Are we scrying on him tonight,

4003
02:55:07.900 --> 02:55:08.980
or are we going up there tonight?

4004
02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:10.420
LAURA: We could do both.

4005
02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:11.390
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

4006
02:55:11.390 --> 02:55:13.220
LAURA: Let's scry on him, and then after we scry,

4007
02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:14.610
we can head over.
MARISHA: Yeah,

4008
02:55:14.610 --> 02:55:17.520
because maybe, maybe we can hit both places.

4009
02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:18.353
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

4010
02:55:18.353 --> 02:55:19.186
TALIESIN: Two steins with one bird.

4011
02:55:19.186 --> 02:55:20.150
MATT: So this is two days in advance,

4012
02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:22.321
you'll be going to the Overcrow.

4013
02:55:23.350 --> 02:55:24.450
Scrying first?

4014
02:55:24.450 --> 02:55:25.283
LAURA: Yeah.

4015
02:55:25.283 --> 02:55:27.600
MATT: Okay, so now you know what the figure looks like,

4016
02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:29.970
and you have the piece of material, correct?

4017
02:55:29.970 --> 02:55:32.308
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4018
02:55:33.231 --> 02:55:35.423
Let me bring up this spell here.

4019
02:55:39.051 --> 02:55:42.520
All righty.

4020
02:55:44.570 --> 02:55:47.560
So as you prepare the scry circle,

4021
02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:52.050
you expend the spell, leaving your consciousness,

4022
02:55:52.050 --> 02:55:56.512
a vision and senses in the hands of the divine Traveler.

4023
02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:03.100
And unfortunately, the spell

4024
02:56:04.250 --> 02:56:08.500
is unable to penetrate the space around this figure,

4025
02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:10.730
they made their saving throw.
ASHLEY: Damn it.

4026
02:56:10.730 --> 02:56:13.910
TALIESIN: Does that mean they know that someone was trying--

4027
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:15.710
MATT: You guys have knowledge of this scrying spell.

4028
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:17.750
Generally, no, it does not mean that they're aware,

4029
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:19.310
but it means that they just resisted it,

4030
02:56:19.310 --> 02:56:20.970
you have to try again another day.

4031
02:56:20.970 --> 02:56:23.510
TALIESIN: Or I could try.
MATT: Or you could try.

4032
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:25.050
MARISHA: Oh, shit.
LAURA: Ooh.

4033
02:56:25.050 --> 02:56:26.610
Two clerics.

4034
02:56:26.610 --> 02:56:29.312
TALIESIN: I've got the weird stuff up right now.

4035
02:56:29.312 --> 02:56:32.673
LAURA: Here, here's a fabric, focus on it real hard.

4036
02:56:32.673 --> 02:56:34.910
LIAM: Not one man should have all that power.

4037
02:56:34.910 --> 02:56:36.100
LAURA: Focus on it real hard, it's called--

4038
02:56:36.100 --> 02:56:36.933
TALIESIN: On what?
LAURA: Wavy blonde,

4039
02:56:36.933 --> 02:56:39.450
he's got wavy blonde hair.
TALIESIN: Wavy blonde hair.

4040
02:56:39.450 --> 02:56:42.480
LAURA: He was medium tall, he had a human ear.

4041
02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:44.021
TALIESIN: Everyone's short to me.

4042
02:56:44.021 --> 02:56:46.680
LAURA: He had a blue cloak on.

4043
02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:48.340
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice.

4044
02:56:48.340 --> 02:56:49.173
LIAM: Zemnian accent.

4045
02:56:49.173 --> 02:56:51.160
LAURA: He had a Zemnian accent.

4046
02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:53.040
TALIESIN: Which one's-- okay.

4047
02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:54.980
LAURA: Here, here's my drawing of him.

4048
02:56:54.980 --> 02:56:56.180
Just focus on my drawing.

4049
02:56:56.180 --> 02:56:58.730
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a really nice drawing.

4050
02:56:58.730 --> 02:57:00.423
SAM: His hair smells like rendered donkey fat--

4051
02:57:00.423 --> 02:57:02.200
MATT: You look at his description, you hold the piece,

4052
02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:04.600
and you close your eyes, giving,

4053
02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:06.710
giving your senses over to the Wildmother,

4054
02:57:06.710 --> 02:57:09.090
and you learn a secondary aspect of this spell,

4055
02:57:09.090 --> 02:57:10.890
which is when a target has resisted it,

4056
02:57:10.890 --> 02:57:12.837
they're immune to it for the next 24 hours.

4057
02:57:12.837 --> 02:57:13.910
(groaning)

4058
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:16.990
So you expend your spell slot, but you have

4059
02:57:16.990 --> 02:57:20.029
to wait another day try to again, unfortunately.

4060
02:57:20.029 --> 02:57:22.200
Sorry.
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

4061
02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:25.500
I spend 20 minutes trying to get it to work.

4062
02:57:25.500 --> 02:57:27.900
I got nothing.
MATT: Sorry.

4063
02:57:27.900 --> 02:57:30.390
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

4064
02:57:30.390 --> 02:57:32.480
LIAM: Well, we can still do--
MARISHA: To the Overcrow.

4065
02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:35.710
MATT: Try it again tomorrow.

4066
02:57:35.710 --> 02:57:38.697
MARISHA: The Overcrow. What time is it in--

4067
02:57:38.697 --> 02:57:41.100
TALIESIN: All our fifths are burned at the moment.

4068
02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:43.270
MATT: I'd say, with the day you guys have been planning

4069
02:57:43.270 --> 02:57:44.590
and discussing and mulling about the house,

4070
02:57:44.590 --> 02:57:46.390
you're getting close to what would be dusk,

4071
02:57:46.390 --> 02:57:47.940
though it is still nighttime.

4072
02:57:48.963 --> 02:57:49.860
LAURA: (whistles)

4073
02:57:49.860 --> 02:57:51.958
MARISHA: Do we want to?

4074
02:57:51.958 --> 02:57:52.791
SAM: Let's do this.

4075
02:57:54.099 --> 02:57:56.310
LIAM: While this shop is open, and preoccupied downstairs,

4076
02:57:56.310 --> 02:57:58.883
or waiting until this person, the owner is asleep?

4077
02:57:58.883 --> 02:58:00.090
LAURA: Maybe do it right as the shop is closing,

4078
02:58:00.090 --> 02:58:02.230
and Fjord can knock on the door, and be like,

4079
02:58:02.230 --> 02:58:03.420
"I've just been thinking about you

4080
02:58:03.420 --> 02:58:05.430
"so much these last couple of weeks,

4081
02:58:05.430 --> 02:58:07.370
"and I really hope I can talk to you,

4082
02:58:07.370 --> 02:58:09.320
"maybe upstairs in your quarters."

4083
02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:10.153
TRAVIS: Okay.

4084
02:58:10.153 --> 02:58:12.729
LAURA: And then she can lead you upstairs.

4085
02:58:12.729 --> 02:58:14.360
Follow her, but as you follow,

4086
02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:17.376
you can slowly open up the shirt that you're wearing.

4087
02:58:20.660 --> 02:58:24.042
SAM: Maruo of the goblin, yeah.

4088
02:58:25.240 --> 02:58:26.860
Let's do this.

4089
02:58:26.860 --> 02:58:29.570
MATT: So you guys leave your home in the Firmaments,

4090
02:58:29.570 --> 02:58:30.990
make your way through the Gallimaufry,

4091
02:58:30.990 --> 02:58:33.090
to the Coronas of the city of Rosohna,

4092
02:58:34.050 --> 02:58:37.190
eventually finding your way through the night streets

4093
02:58:37.190 --> 02:58:40.330
to the outskirts of the Overcrow Apothecary.

4094
02:58:40.330 --> 02:58:41.320
Approaching the familiar building,

4095
02:58:41.320 --> 02:58:42.950
for those who have already been here before,

4096
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:44.240
the rest of you seeing it for the first time,

4097
02:58:44.240 --> 02:58:47.300
you can see the two-storied thin

4098
02:58:47.300 --> 02:58:51.220
but tall structure between the nearby buildings.

4099
02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:53.670
There's a larger makeshift inn

4100
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:57.000
to the left side, and another thatched structure

4101
02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:58.290
to the right that looks rickety,

4102
02:58:58.290 --> 02:59:00.570
and put together with sticks, and whatever sort

4103
02:59:00.570 --> 02:59:03.520
of dried reeds could be strapped together.

4104
02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:05.620
But there, in the center, is the structure,

4105
02:59:05.620 --> 02:59:08.230
this painted home with the chains hanging

4106
02:59:08.230 --> 02:59:10.330
from the outside of the roofing elements.

4107
02:59:12.357 --> 02:59:14.480
The door appears to be closed,

4108
02:59:14.480 --> 02:59:15.870
but you do see a little bit of glowing light

4109
02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:20.700
from the top and bottom of it, where there's a slight gap.

4110
02:59:20.700 --> 02:59:23.630
LIAM: Before we go in, Caduceus, will you block my view

4111
02:59:23.630 --> 02:59:26.070
in this alleyway over here for a moment?

4112
02:59:26.070 --> 02:59:27.690
MATT: You do also see the second floor, like,

4113
02:59:27.690 --> 02:59:29.010
there is a bit of roofing up there.

4114
02:59:29.010 --> 02:59:31.460
The second floor does have a window to the front,

4115
02:59:31.460 --> 02:59:34.250
but it is closed, there are two wooden shutters

4116
02:59:34.250 --> 02:59:35.991
that are closed on it.

4117
02:59:35.991 --> 02:59:37.016
LIAM: Okay.

4118
02:59:37.016 --> 02:59:39.050
In an alleyway, if that's possible.

4119
02:59:39.050 --> 02:59:41.820
MATT: Okay, it's tight, you have to probably go

4120
02:59:41.820 --> 02:59:44.650
across the street, or around, because this building is

4121
02:59:44.650 --> 02:59:46.410
right up against the other two.

4122
02:59:46.410 --> 02:59:49.166
LIAM: It's better to go a ways away for a minute.

4123
02:59:49.166 --> 02:59:49.999
So I just need a private space

4124
02:59:49.999 --> 02:59:52.370
to apparate Frumpkin, and then

4125
02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:56.700
I

4126
02:59:56.700 --> 03:00:01.700
use a bit of gum arabic, and cast Invisibility on Frumpkin.

4127
03:00:02.170 --> 03:00:03.540
MATT: Okay.

4128
03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:05.710
LIAM: So I have an invisible cat on my shoulder.

4129
03:00:05.710 --> 03:00:08.610
MATT: Yes, you do, Frumpkin is invisible.

4130
03:00:09.650 --> 03:00:12.240
Anybody else doing anything?

4131
03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:13.973
MARISHA: I put up my hood,

4132
03:00:13.973 --> 03:00:15.570
try and hide my face as much as I can.

4133
03:00:15.570 --> 03:00:17.310
SAM: Are we all going in, or--

4134
03:00:17.310 --> 03:00:20.840
MARISHA: No, I'm going to-- is there a back entrance,

4135
03:00:20.840 --> 03:00:22.980
is there a back alley to this building?

4136
03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:26.630
MATT: You go around the sides, there is a way

4137
03:00:26.630 --> 03:00:28.560
to get to the back, there's not an alleyway.

4138
03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:30.360
A lot of the buildings in this area are kind

4139
03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:32.340
of jammed together, there's not a lot of space between them,

4140
03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:34.440
at least in the side of the street.

4141
03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:37.960
So about eight or nine buildings down,

4142
03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:39.810
there is enough of a gap where you can squeeze through,

4143
03:00:39.810 --> 03:00:41.450
and there is a back alley there,

4144
03:00:41.450 --> 03:00:43.730
but it isn't gridded well.

4145
03:00:45.480 --> 03:00:47.777
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: But it's possible, yeah.

4146
03:00:47.777 --> 03:00:49.788
MARISHA: I'm going to take the long way,

4147
03:00:49.788 --> 03:00:52.790
I'm going to let these guys know we should split up,

4148
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:54.940
so we're not that suspicious, I'm going to go around back,

4149
03:00:54.940 --> 03:00:57.380
and I'm going to loop around.

4150
03:00:57.380 --> 03:00:59.730
And keep an eye out for anyone who might be watching.

4151
03:00:59.730 --> 03:01:01.790
MATT: Got it, make a stealth check and perception check.

4152
03:01:06.490 --> 03:01:08.880
MARISHA: Stealth check is a 22.

4153
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:14.298
Perception check is--
LIAM: Come on.

4154
03:01:14.298 --> 03:01:17.750
MARISHA: Not as good as I wanted it to be, an 11.

4155
03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:19.805
MATT: 11, okay. Keeping your eyes out,

4156
03:01:19.805 --> 03:01:23.480
you feel confident that no one seems to be paying much mind

4157
03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:25.580
to you as you travel through the streets,

4158
03:01:25.580 --> 03:01:27.660
face hidden amongst the cloak.

4159
03:01:27.660 --> 03:01:28.980
You make your way into the back alley,

4160
03:01:28.980 --> 03:01:30.710
glancing about, eventually you walk along,

4161
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:32.790
until you are behind the building in question,

4162
03:01:32.790 --> 03:01:34.980
and you are in position there to watch.

4163
03:01:34.980 --> 03:01:36.980
LIAM: You're going to go in as the face, correct?

4164
03:01:36.980 --> 03:01:40.760
TRAVIS:a Yep, yeah, I guess I'll try and keep her

4165
03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:42.260
by the front door.
LAURA: Do you want me to go in,

4166
03:01:42.260 --> 03:01:44.890
too, because I've got the hair stuff, so I've got a good in.

4167
03:01:44.890 --> 03:01:46.790
MARISHA: Oh, sure, yeah, that-- yeah, why not.

4168
03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:50.570
LIAM: I telepathically command invisible Frumpkin

4169
03:01:50.570 --> 03:01:53.928
to stay by Fjord until they're inside,

4170
03:01:53.928 --> 03:01:58.450
and once I see that the shop keep is preoccupied,

4171
03:01:58.450 --> 03:02:01.030
he will then start to search the building.

4172
03:02:01.030 --> 03:02:02.261
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

4173
03:02:02.261 --> 03:02:03.740
MATT: Are you--

4174
03:02:03.740 --> 03:02:06.430
LIAM: I'm staying outside, I need someone to stay with me.

4175
03:02:06.430 --> 03:02:07.790
TALIESIN: I'm right there.
LIAM: Okay.

4176
03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:09.565
MATT: Okay, so Caduceus is staying with Caleb.

4177
03:02:09.565 --> 03:02:10.723
Yasha, what are you doing?

4178
03:02:10.723 --> 03:02:13.110
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to stay with you guys as well.

4179
03:02:13.110 --> 03:02:14.710
I'm going to stay with Caleb, and--

4180
03:02:15.640 --> 03:02:18.370
MATT: Okay, so we have Caduceus, Yasha, and Caleb outside,

4181
03:02:18.370 --> 03:02:19.770
you find a little pocket on one

4182
03:02:19.770 --> 03:02:20.960
of the nearby buildings, you just sit down.

4183
03:02:20.960 --> 03:02:22.390
TRAVIS: Do you want to keep her at the front door,

4184
03:02:22.390 --> 03:02:24.280
or do you want to actually go in the shop?

4185
03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:26.680
LAURA: I think we should probably go in the shop.

4186
03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:27.560
TRAVIS: All right.

4187
03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:29.340
LAURA: You should see if, you know--

4188
03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:31.251
TRAVIS: Just go in the fucking shop.

4189
03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:37.160
SAM: I'm around back with Beau and rub a little gum arabic

4190
03:02:37.180 --> 03:02:40.180
on my eyebrows, and turn invisible, as well.

4191
03:02:40.180 --> 03:02:42.380
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check with advantage.

4192
03:02:44.390 --> 03:02:46.540
SAM: 28.

4193
03:02:46.540 --> 03:02:48.650
MATT: Okay, you're, you feel pretty good.

4194
03:02:48.650 --> 03:02:50.355
LIAM: So damn good.
MATT: All right,

4195
03:02:50.355 --> 03:02:52.533
so you knock on the door. (knocking)

4196
03:02:52.533 --> 03:02:54.314
"We're closing."

4197
03:02:54.314 --> 03:02:55.447
LAURA: Can I come in for just a moment?

4198
03:02:55.447 --> 03:02:57.570
I have a question about something I bought.

4199
03:02:57.570 --> 03:03:00.087
MATT: "Fine, come in."
LAURA: Thank you.

4200
03:03:02.074 --> 03:03:03.493
MATT: "Oh, hey!"
LAURA: Hi.

4201
03:03:03.493 --> 03:03:05.935
MATT: "Good to see you."
LAURA: You, too.

4202
03:03:05.935 --> 03:03:06.768
MATT: "Yeah."

4203
03:03:07.720 --> 03:03:09.430
MATT: Do you walk in with?
TRAVIS: I do.

4204
03:03:09.430 --> 03:03:13.270
MATT: "And hell-o."

4205
03:03:13.270 --> 03:03:15.280
TRAVIS: Maruo, it is good to see you.

4206
03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:19.450
MATT: "No, the pleasure is mine."
TRAVIS: Mmm.

4207
03:03:19.450 --> 03:03:22.930
LAURA: I have a question about the hair oil that I bought.

4208
03:03:22.930 --> 03:03:26.320
MATT: "Oh, you're using it, I'm so happy."

4209
03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:29.520
LAURA: Yes, I've been using it every night for a week now.

4210
03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:30.353
MATT: "Ooh!"

4211
03:03:30.353 --> 03:03:31.619
LAURA: And I didn't know,

4212
03:03:31.619 --> 03:03:34.010
am I supposed to wash my hair ever,

4213
03:03:34.010 --> 03:03:38.890
or just leave it in? Does it just keep building up

4214
03:03:38.890 --> 03:03:41.000
and up over time, and then all the sudden,

4215
03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.900
my hair grows a foot? I don't understand.

4216
03:03:43.900 --> 03:03:46.407
MATT: "I think that's more of a cultural choice."

4217
03:03:46.407 --> 03:03:48.150
(laughter)

4218
03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:50.200
"I tend to leave it in."
LAURA: Okay.

4219
03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:51.870
MATT: "But, you know, whatever you want."

4220
03:03:51.870 --> 03:03:54.560
LAURA: How-- do you always-- do you ever wash your hair?

4221
03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:55.750
TRAVIS: The fragrance is rather--

4222
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:57.400
MATT: "It just gets in the way."

4223
03:03:57.400 --> 03:03:58.580
LAURA: Oh, okay.

4224
03:03:59.590 --> 03:04:01.910
Cool, I was just wondering how to use it.

4225
03:04:01.910 --> 03:04:03.240
You know, it's the funniest thing,

4226
03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:05.790
every time I put it in, Fjord is like,

4227
03:04:05.790 --> 03:04:07.890
you smell so good, you smell so familiar,

4228
03:04:07.890 --> 03:04:10.410
and I'm like, I smell like Maruo, I think.

4229
03:04:10.410 --> 03:04:11.243
And then he's like, oh--

4230
03:04:11.243 --> 03:04:13.550
TRAVIS: I was wondering where that smell was--

4231
03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:15.240
what it was reminding me of.

4232
03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:18.067
MATT: "Well, you certainly found the source."

4233
03:04:18.067 --> 03:04:20.730
TRAVIS: I did, I did, I tell you.

4234
03:04:20.730 --> 03:04:23.940
LAURA: He won't shut up about how good he thinks it smells.

4235
03:04:23.940 --> 03:04:25.183
MATT: "Really?"

4236
03:04:25.183 --> 03:04:28.216
TRAVIS: So good, just makes my whole body flame,

4237
03:04:28.216 --> 03:04:30.923
tingles galore.

4238
03:04:30.923 --> 03:04:32.440
MATT: "Well."
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4239
03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:36.010
Now, listen, I was wondering, do you have anything

4240
03:04:36.010 --> 03:04:38.530
around here that a feller good drink,

4241
03:04:38.530 --> 03:04:40.890
or pour on himself to, I don't know,

4242
03:04:40.890 --> 03:04:44.820
make someone fall in love with him?

4243
03:04:44.820 --> 03:04:46.868
LIAM: Frumpkin has been on the move for a minute.

4244
03:04:46.868 --> 03:04:49.360
MATT: So all this is happening.

4245
03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:50.680
TALIESIN: So proud.

4246
03:04:50.680 --> 03:04:53.580
SAM: Is there a back window or anything, a back door?

4247
03:04:53.580 --> 03:04:57.046
MATT: There is not a back, no-- there is not a back door.

4248
03:04:57.046 --> 03:04:57.879
SAM: Oh.

4249
03:04:57.879 --> 03:05:00.460
MATT: There is a back window on the side.

4250
03:05:00.460 --> 03:05:02.520
There's a small little room

4251
03:05:02.520 --> 03:05:05.930
on the side of the main two story building

4252
03:05:05.930 --> 03:05:07.620
that has a window that is currently closed.

4253
03:05:07.620 --> 03:05:09.140
SAM: I'm going to go look in it.

4254
03:05:09.140 --> 03:05:10.790
MARISHA: I'm going to give Nott a boost.

4255
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:11.623
SAM: Thank you.

4256
03:05:11.623 --> 03:05:13.280
MATT: Okay, you don't know where to find Nott, but--

4257
03:05:13.280 --> 03:05:14.350
MARISHA: No, we're--
LIAM: Invisible.

4258
03:05:14.350 --> 03:05:15.183
MARISHA: Oh.

4259
03:05:15.183 --> 03:05:16.016
SAM: Pulling on your--

4260
03:05:16.016 --> 03:05:17.137
MARISHA: I thought we were-- yeah.

4261
03:05:17.137 --> 03:05:19.200
MATT: Okay, yeah, it is closed,

4262
03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:21.589
and you go ahead and push, and it is locked.

4263
03:05:21.589 --> 03:05:22.580
MARISHA: Can you lock pick it?
SAM: I'll start to unlock it.

4264
03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:23.413
MATT: Okay.

4265
03:05:23.413 --> 03:05:24.830
So it's latched from the inside,

4266
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:25.930
so you go ahead and get your tools out,

4267
03:05:25.930 --> 03:05:28.270
go ahead and roll proficiency plus dexterity.

4268
03:05:29.950 --> 03:05:30.783
SAM: One.

4269
03:05:30.783 --> 03:05:31.890
MARISHA: No!

4270
03:05:33.410 --> 03:05:34.520
Fuck.

4271
03:05:34.520 --> 03:05:36.370
MATT: You get your hook behind there, and you're like,

4272
03:05:36.370 --> 03:05:39.520
"I got it!" You pull, pull, and it resists,

4273
03:05:39.520 --> 03:05:41.195
and it slips out of your fingers,

4274
03:05:41.195 --> 03:05:42.910
and instead your tool, (clinking)

4275
03:05:42.910 --> 03:05:44.632
on the inside of the building.

4276
03:05:44.632 --> 03:05:46.480
MARISHA: What happened? Oh, no.

4277
03:05:46.480 --> 03:05:47.746
MATT: You guys are talking, and--

4278
03:05:47.746 --> 03:05:48.846
"Huh?"

4279
03:05:48.846 --> 03:05:52.580
TRAVIS: Maruo, I don't know how to say this, but I need you.

4280
03:05:52.580 --> 03:05:54.100
MATT: "Hold on just a second, I'm sorry--"

4281
03:05:54.100 --> 03:05:57.510
TRAVIS: No, listen, my passion is-- and I pull my armor open

4282
03:05:57.510 --> 03:06:00.317
to show my-- my half-orc chest.

4283
03:06:00.317 --> 03:06:02.192
(laughter)

4284
03:06:02.192 --> 03:06:04.693
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

4285
03:06:05.993 --> 03:06:06.826
TRAVIS: 22!

4286
03:06:06.826 --> 03:06:09.258
LAURA: I use thaumaturgy to blow his hair back,

4287
03:06:09.258 --> 03:06:13.580
just a little bit.
(laughter)

4288
03:06:13.580 --> 03:06:14.413
MATT: This--

4289
03:06:15.694 --> 03:06:18.700
paranoid goblin is so torn.

4290
03:06:18.700 --> 03:06:22.066
She's like--
(strangled noise)

4291
03:06:22.066 --> 03:06:24.824
(laughter)

4292
03:06:26.042 --> 03:06:26.875
"Well.

4293
03:06:29.038 --> 03:06:30.990
"What you're asking, maybe don't have much

4294
03:06:30.990 --> 03:06:35.990
"in the way of potions, but oil applications can be helpful.

4295
03:06:36.120 --> 03:06:38.629
And she rolls her arms up a bit.

4296
03:06:38.629 --> 03:06:42.422
TRAVIS: ♪ Light of my life ♪

03:06:49.640 --> 03:06:51.180
MARISHA: Beau gave me her thieves tools.

4302
03:06:51.180 --> 03:06:52.841
MATT: You have thieves tools, as well?

4303
03:06:52.841 --> 03:06:54.258
MARISHA: I always keep thieves tools on me.

4304
03:06:54.258 --> 03:06:55.946
MATT: All right. That's good you have a backup.

4305
03:06:55.946 --> 03:06:57.396
MARISHA: I gave you one set before, and I re-bought them.

4306
03:06:57.396 --> 03:06:59.137
TRAVIS: Singing real loud.
LAURA: Oh, god, oh, god.

4307
03:07:00.235 --> 03:07:01.068
Come on, goddamn it.

4308
03:07:01.068 --> 03:07:01.970
SAM: 18.

4309
03:07:01.970 --> 03:07:03.382
MATT: 18, okay.

4310
03:07:06.437 --> 03:07:07.904
It's not opening.

4311
03:07:07.904 --> 03:07:09.800
(groaning)

4312
03:07:09.800 --> 03:07:11.450
LIAM: Caleb has gone full Bran Stark,

4313
03:07:11.450 --> 03:07:13.800
and is holding onto Yasha and Caduceus' arms,

4314
03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:15.960
and my cat has been in the for two minutes by now.

4315
03:07:15.960 --> 03:07:17.230
MATT: Yes, and at this point,

4316
03:07:19.050 --> 03:07:21.430
Maruo has gone beneath the counter,

4317
03:07:21.430 --> 03:07:24.450
and is pulling out this thick salve, like a balm,

4318
03:07:24.450 --> 03:07:28.068
and is like, "But it needs to be applied directly."

4319
03:07:28.068 --> 03:07:30.353
(laughter)

4320
03:07:30.353 --> 03:07:31.760
LAURA: Do you guys need some privacy?

4321
03:07:31.760 --> 03:07:34.161
I can wait down here.
MATT: "No, it's fine."

4322
03:07:34.161 --> 03:07:36.130
LAURA: Oh.
(laughter)

4323
03:07:36.130 --> 03:07:37.480

4327
03:07:45.322 --> 03:07:47.460
MATT: Fjord is quietly, eyes closed, singing to himself,

4328
03:07:47.460 --> 03:07:49.385
putting his mind elsewhere.

4329
03:07:49.385 --> 03:07:52.420
Maruo goes and grabs a stool. (scraping)

4330
03:07:52.420 --> 03:07:54.650
LIAM: Just thinking about Uk'otoa.
MATT: Jumps onto it

4331
03:07:54.650 --> 03:07:56.510
to get up, and begins to apply it

4332
03:07:56.510 --> 03:07:58.482
on the exposed chest of Fjord.

4333
03:07:58.482 --> 03:07:59.953
(Fjord sings loud and badly)

4334
03:07:59.953 --> 03:08:02.280
LAURA: Can I-- is it-- how distracted is she?

4335
03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:03.240
LIAM: So distracted.

4336
03:08:03.240 --> 03:08:04.250
MATT: She's pretty distracted right now.

4337
03:08:04.250 --> 03:08:07.060
LAURA: Could I just walk backwards over to the window,

4338
03:08:07.060 --> 03:08:08.010
and unlatch it?

4339
03:08:10.380 --> 03:08:11.340
MATT: The--

4340
03:08:11.340 --> 03:08:12.173
MARISHA: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

4341
03:08:12.173 --> 03:08:13.020
MATT: The room they're going into is not--

4342
03:08:13.020 --> 03:08:15.368
it's technically, it's on the side of the chamber you're in.

4343
03:08:15.368 --> 03:08:16.460
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

4344
03:08:16.460 --> 03:08:19.917
MATT: You look around, and you see there is no back

4345
03:08:19.917 --> 03:08:22.110
door, necessarily, there's a small closet back there,

4346
03:08:22.110 --> 03:08:23.630
and there's a door to leads to

4347
03:08:23.630 --> 03:08:26.010
a storage chamber of some kind.

4348
03:08:27.640 --> 03:08:29.580
So, at that point, you're not really in a place

4349
03:08:29.580 --> 03:08:32.038
where you help with that, unfortunately.

4350
03:08:33.270 --> 03:08:35.530
So this whole time, while this is happening.

4351
03:08:35.530 --> 03:08:37.096
MARISHA: Fuck.
LIAM: Three minutes later.

4352
03:08:37.096 --> 03:08:38.473
MARISHA: Fucking doors!

4353
03:08:38.473 --> 03:08:40.325
LIAM: Cat's been over every inch of the house.

4354
03:08:40.325 --> 03:08:41.760
MATT: Make an investigation check, what are you looking for?

4355
03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:43.290
LIAM: I want the lay of the entire building,

4356
03:08:43.290 --> 03:08:44.560
and see if anything is weird or--

4357
03:08:44.560 --> 03:08:45.918
MATT: Oh, perception check, then.

4358
03:08:45.918 --> 03:08:47.047
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, okay.

4359
03:08:47.047 --> 03:08:48.980
SAM: And I will also be casting mage hand.

4360
03:08:48.980 --> 03:08:49.813
MATT: Okay.

4361
03:08:49.813 --> 03:08:51.520
TALIESIN: I also describe where I was seeing the glow

4362
03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:53.830
from-- I did my best to give him a sense

4363
03:08:53.830 --> 03:08:55.690
of where I saw a weird glow last time.

4364
03:08:55.690 --> 03:08:56.720
MATT: Yeah, the glow is in the far back

4365
03:08:56.720 --> 03:08:58.510
corner, so if you're facing

4366
03:08:58.510 --> 03:09:01.550
from the front door inward, there is a countertop where--

4367
03:09:01.550 --> 03:09:03.940
Maruo is stationed there, there are two tables

4368
03:09:03.940 --> 03:09:05.460
that flank the sides, and there's just shit

4369
03:09:05.460 --> 03:09:07.922
on the walls, and boxes and empty things everywhere.

4370
03:09:07.922 --> 03:09:10.680
And then there is the spiral staircase towards the back

4371
03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:12.850
that leads upward to the second floor.

4372
03:09:15.418 --> 03:09:17.650
On the side, back of the chamber,

4373
03:09:17.650 --> 03:09:19.650
the glow, you recall, is in the far back corner.

4374
03:09:19.650 --> 03:09:21.580
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: 22.

4375
03:09:21.580 --> 03:09:25.260
MATT: 22. All right. You,

4376
03:09:25.260 --> 03:09:26.710
through Frumpkin, notice the entire layout

4377
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:29.440
of the interior of this chamber, everyone's location.

4378
03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:32.125
There is the closed door on the far back,

4379
03:09:32.125 --> 03:09:34.120
and then behind where they all are,

4380
03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:35.450
and there is the spiral staircase

4381
03:09:35.450 --> 03:09:37.002
that leads up to the secondary floor.

4382
03:09:38.650 --> 03:09:40.650
Up through the staircase, there is a door there.

4383
03:09:41.504 --> 03:09:42.745
It is closed.
LIAM: Hmm.

4384
03:09:43.645 --> 03:09:45.745
LIAM: That's the end of the road for me.

4385
03:09:45.745 --> 03:09:47.240
End of the road.

4386
03:09:48.260 --> 03:09:49.850
Can Frumpkin peer-- is there a crack,

4387
03:09:49.850 --> 03:09:52.630
is there any kind of slit at the bottom?

4388
03:09:52.630 --> 03:09:53.890
MATT: With the perception check you rolled,

4389
03:09:53.890 --> 03:09:56.210
there is, but there's no light,

4390
03:09:56.210 --> 03:09:57.810
so roll a perception with disadvantage.

4391
03:09:57.810 --> 03:09:58.643
LIAM: Okay.

4392
03:10:01.180 --> 03:10:02.810
Terrible, both terrible.

4393
03:10:04.317 --> 03:10:05.150
Seven.

4394
03:10:05.150 --> 03:10:06.350
SAM: Yasha, just go in and kill everybody.

4395
03:10:06.350 --> 03:10:07.590
MATT: Can't really get a view of the space,

4396
03:10:07.590 --> 03:10:08.750
it's a little too thin,

4397
03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:10.331
Frumpkin can't quite get an eye around it.

4398
03:10:10.331 --> 03:10:12.480
ASHLEY: It's an option.

4399
03:10:12.480 --> 03:10:14.100
SAM: And I try Mage Hand.

4400
03:10:14.100 --> 03:10:15.166
MATT: Okay.

4401
03:10:15.166 --> 03:10:18.170
SAM: Sort of blindly flick to try to open.

4402
03:10:18.170 --> 03:10:19.650
It doesn't have to be within sight,

4403
03:10:19.650 --> 03:10:21.380
it can be any point within range.

4404
03:10:21.380 --> 03:10:22.500
LAURA: You can probably see through it,

4405
03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:23.620
since it's a window.
MATT: Any point within range?

4406
03:10:23.620 --> 03:10:26.080
SAM: It says, any point you choose within range,

4407
03:10:26.080 --> 03:10:28.100
it doesn't have to have a line of sight.

4408
03:10:28.100 --> 03:10:30.410
MATT: That's true, okay, all right.

4409
03:10:30.410 --> 03:10:32.980
SAM: But I won't know what I'm doing.

4410
03:10:32.980 --> 03:10:34.290
I'll be blindly trying to--

4411
03:10:34.290 --> 03:10:36.463
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check without thieves tools,

4412
03:10:36.463 --> 03:10:37.880
so just, just--
SAM: Unstrap the bra.

4413
03:10:37.880 --> 03:10:39.540
MATT: A straight dexterity check with disadvantage.

4414
03:10:39.540 --> 03:10:40.820
SAM: Huh, a straight?

4415
03:10:40.820 --> 03:10:43.090
MATT: A straight dexterity check with disadvantage.

4416
03:10:43.090 --> 03:10:44.360
SAM: With <i>disadvantage</i>?

4417
03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:45.603
MATT: Correct, because you can't see it.

4418
03:10:45.603 --> 03:10:46.710
LIAM: You're doing it blind.

4419
03:10:46.710 --> 03:10:50.870
SAM: I rolled a 17 and a 16, both plus five, both over 20.

4420
03:10:52.420 --> 03:10:54.111
MATT: Opens up.

4421
03:10:54.111 --> 03:10:56.065
(laughter)

4422
03:10:56.065 --> 03:10:57.017
Lucky rolls.
MARISHA: I try to give Nott

4423
03:10:57.017 --> 03:10:58.890
a high five, but she's invisible.

4424
03:10:58.890 --> 03:11:01.510
MATT: Yep.
You hit Nott in the back of the head.

4425
03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:02.835
MARISHA: You're visible again?

4426
03:11:02.835 --> 03:11:04.553
MATT: That's right, you cast Mage Hand.

4427
03:11:04.553 --> 03:11:07.089
SAM: But I cast Invisibility again.

4428
03:11:07.089 --> 03:11:08.360
MARISHA: I give her a boost through the window,

4429
03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:11.790
and then I go in, stealthily as fuck, goggles on.

4430
03:11:11.790 --> 03:11:15.220
MATT: Okay, you both quietly make your way in.

4431
03:11:15.220 --> 03:11:18.740
This is a storage chamber, the smell is extremely strong.

4432
03:11:19.660 --> 03:11:21.280
All the scents that were inside the building

4433
03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:25.050
when you were there last time tripled

4434
03:11:25.050 --> 03:11:28.427
in pungency and intensity.

4435
03:11:28.427 --> 03:11:30.877
All sorts of mildewed,

4436
03:11:32.820 --> 03:11:35.750
composting, earthen-type smells.

4437
03:11:36.970 --> 03:11:38.760
There are a number of small boxes and chests

4438
03:11:38.760 --> 03:11:41.830
that are locked, and there's the door to the right.

4439
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:46.301
And you can hear Fjord singing through the doorway--

4440
03:11:46.301 --> 03:11:49.828
TRAVIS: ♪ I knew when I saw you ♪

4441
03:11:49.828 --> 03:11:51.283
LAURA: Okay, I'm looking for--

4442
03:11:51.283 --> 03:11:53.272
MATT: "And you place it along the sternum."

4443
03:11:53.272 --> 03:11:55.702
LAURA: I'm just watching with heart eyes,

4444
03:11:55.702 --> 03:11:57.507
as I'm watching Fjord get oiled up.

4445
03:11:57.507 --> 03:12:00.447
♪ That I'll ♪

4446
03:12:00.447 --> 03:12:01.838
♪ Until ♪

4447
03:12:01.838 --> 03:12:04.962
MARISHA: Correspondence, letters, mail.

4448
03:12:04.962 --> 03:12:06.003
MATT: Investigation.

4449
03:12:06.003 --> 03:12:07.999
LIAM: Jester with a sweaty upper lip.

4450
03:12:07.999 --> 03:12:09.170
(laughter)

4451
03:12:09.170 --> 03:12:10.710
SAM: What is this room that we're in?

4452
03:12:10.710 --> 03:12:13.624
LAURA: And oily hair just--
MATT: 15 feet by 15 feet.

4453
03:12:13.624 --> 03:12:16.671
LIAM: Right out of Napoleon Dynamite.
ASHLEY: In slow-mo.

4454
03:12:16.671 --> 03:12:19.760
♪ I, I just died in your arms tonight ♪

4455
03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:20.593
MARISHA: 11.

4456
03:12:20.593 --> 03:12:21.426
MATT: Oh, you're helping with this, too?

4457
03:12:21.426 --> 03:12:22.460
SAM: Yeah, I'm looking around, as well.

4458
03:12:22.460 --> 03:12:24.880
MATT: All right, investigation check.

4459
03:12:24.880 --> 03:12:27.640
MARISHA: Please roll better than me.
SAM: 24.

4460
03:12:27.640 --> 03:12:28.870
MATT: 24, okay.

4461
03:12:30.160 --> 03:12:32.900
Looking around the room, you don't find any correspondence.

4462
03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:36.630
There's no papers kept in here. You do find there are a lot

4463
03:12:36.630 --> 03:12:39.860
of boxes that are chained and locked

4464
03:12:41.844 --> 03:12:44.540
of different sizes, and different qualities.

4465
03:12:44.540 --> 03:12:46.330
Half of the room appears to be materials

4466
03:12:46.330 --> 03:12:50.840
for use in the creation of these potions,

4467
03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:52.740
chemicals, balms and such.

4468
03:12:52.740 --> 03:12:54.882
And there are, broken apart,

4469
03:12:54.882 --> 03:12:56.830
a few alchemical supply kits

4470
03:12:56.830 --> 03:12:59.090
that are probably used, not well taken care of

4471
03:12:59.090 --> 03:13:01.156
in the creation of these.

4472
03:13:01.156 --> 03:13:02.565
But then apart from that

4473
03:13:02.565 --> 03:13:04.450
and those supplies, there are these--

4474
03:13:04.450 --> 03:13:06.360
this wide variety of different size boxes,

4475
03:13:06.360 --> 03:13:09.080
some wooden, some metal, some iron.

4476
03:13:09.080 --> 03:13:10.810
There's a small silver box.

4477
03:13:10.810 --> 03:13:13.018
MARISHA: Anything written on them, any signs--

4478
03:13:13.018 --> 03:13:14.459
LIAM: Rhino fat, ostrich fat--

4479
03:13:14.459 --> 03:13:17.480
MARISHA: -- that they've been making dunamancy back here?

4480
03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:20.283
MATT: Nothing that seems to catch your attention there.

4481
03:13:20.283 --> 03:13:21.650
They are locked.

4482
03:13:21.650 --> 03:13:23.250
SAM: I'm going to point towards the front

4483
03:13:23.250 --> 03:13:26.150
of the thing, hold the wire up to my lips,

4484
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:28.640
and say, Mr. Clay, Mr. Clay, come back here right away,

4485
03:13:28.640 --> 03:13:30.890
as fast as you can, to the back of the house.

4486
03:13:33.100 --> 03:13:34.490
TALIESIN: I'm-- all right.

4487
03:13:34.490 --> 03:13:36.060
SAM: You can reply to this message.

4488
03:13:36.060 --> 03:13:37.070
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

4489
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:39.235
ASHLEY: Do you want to stay here, Caleb?

4490
03:13:39.235 --> 03:13:43.010
LIAM: I will stay, I pull out the wire, and say--

4491
03:13:43.010 --> 03:13:46.410
TALIESIN: I'm going to quietly walk to the-- to the--

4492
03:13:46.410 --> 03:13:48.560
nonchalantly walk to the back of the house.

4493
03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:49.932
LIAM: Open the door for my cat please.

4494
03:13:49.932 --> 03:13:52.398
TALIESIN: I'm also going to change my appearance.

4495
03:13:52.398 --> 03:13:53.231
MATT: To?
MATT: I'm going to go to,

4496
03:13:53.231 --> 03:13:56.148
I'm going to go to--
SAM: Oh, to me?

4497
03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:01.700
The closest I can think of to hippy drow.

4498
03:14:02.920 --> 03:14:03.753
MATT: Okay.

4499
03:14:03.753 --> 03:14:05.110
TALIESIN: It's an attempt.
LIAM: Hippy drow.

4500
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:06.472
MATT: All right, all right.
SAM: Hippy drow.

4501
03:14:06.472 --> 03:14:07.755
TALIESIN: Hippy drow.

4502
03:14:07.755 --> 03:14:09.405
LIAM: Hippy drow.
All right, all right, all right.

4503
03:14:09.405 --> 03:14:10.763
MATT: Make a stealth check.

4504
03:14:10.763 --> 03:14:12.480
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right.

4505
03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:13.840
TALIESIN: 12.
MATT: 12, okay.

4506
03:14:16.067 --> 03:14:18.198
SAM: I keep getting older, but I got many lives.

4507
03:14:18.198 --> 03:14:19.635
TALIESIN: I'm not coming in or anything,

4508
03:14:19.635 --> 03:14:21.650
I'm just stopping at the open window and looking in.

4509
03:14:21.650 --> 03:14:23.300
MATT: Okay, you make your way around.

4510
03:14:25.440 --> 03:14:27.120
In your new form, as the drow,

4511
03:14:27.120 --> 03:14:29.320
you do not draw as much attention as you would have before,

4512
03:14:29.320 --> 03:14:31.070
so the DC was not as high as it would have been.

4513
03:14:31.070 --> 03:14:33.490
So no one seems to be following you.

4514
03:14:34.360 --> 03:14:35.870
Eventually, you guys that are behind you watch

4515
03:14:35.870 --> 03:14:39.040
as a hippy-looking drow slowly saunters up

4516
03:14:39.040 --> 03:14:39.980
in your direction.

4517
03:14:42.540 --> 03:14:44.700
SAM: Is it--?

4518
03:14:44.700 --> 03:14:46.840
Is it?
MARISHA: You can tell by the staff.

4519
03:14:46.840 --> 03:14:48.930
Yes.
SAM: Is he holding a staff, I--

4520
03:14:48.930 --> 03:14:50.230
MATT: Same material.
SAM: Oh, oh.

4521
03:14:50.230 --> 03:14:53.960
Hi, hi, do your detect magic thing,

4522
03:14:53.960 --> 03:14:56.250
we don't know which box it is.
TALIESIN: Detect magic.

4523
03:14:57.325 --> 03:14:58.943
MATT: You detect magic.

4524
03:14:58.943 --> 03:15:00.988
Nothing in the chamber draws a magical essence,

4525
03:15:00.988 --> 03:15:03.737
but inside the room, where they are,

4526
03:15:03.737 --> 03:15:06.290
in that same corner where you left it last time.

4527
03:15:06.290 --> 03:15:08.050
SAM: In the room where Fjord and Jester are?

4528
03:15:08.050 --> 03:15:09.230
MATT: Right.
SAM: Shit.

4529
03:15:09.230 --> 03:15:11.113
MARISHA: I pick up the thieves' tools that he dropped,

4530
03:15:11.113 --> 03:15:11.946
by the way.

4531
03:15:11.946 --> 03:15:13.040
MATT: You pick up and regather it.

4532
03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:14.815
TALIESIN: It's in the other room over in the corner,

4533
03:15:14.815 --> 03:15:17.232
over the thing. I'll see you guys later.

4534
03:15:17.232 --> 03:15:18.670
I'm just going to close the window.

4535
03:15:18.670 --> 03:15:20.360
I'm not going to lock it, but I am going to close the window

4536
03:15:20.360 --> 03:15:22.010
and keep walking.
MATT: Okay.

4537
03:15:22.010 --> 03:15:24.220
MARISHA: Should we try and pop open one of these grates?

4538
03:15:24.220 --> 03:15:25.790
TALIESIN: And I keep walking.

4539
03:15:25.790 --> 03:15:27.420
SAM: There's nothing magical in them.

4540
03:15:27.420 --> 03:15:29.480
Sure, yeah, sure, I'll just-- yeah.

4541
03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:31.780
You take one, I'll take one, yeah.

4542
03:15:31.780 --> 03:15:33.610
MARISHA: I'll see if I can pop a crate.
LAURA: Why?

4543
03:15:33.610 --> 03:15:35.590
SAM: I don't know. We gotta do something.

4544
03:15:35.590 --> 03:15:37.300
TRAVIS: I can't keep this up forever, fucking--

4545
03:15:37.300 --> 03:15:39.150
you're not searching that inventory list.

4546
03:15:39.150 --> 03:15:40.530
MARISHA: It'll take 20 seconds--
SAM: Caleb told me,

4547
03:15:40.530 --> 03:15:42.170
did you message me to open the door for the--

4548
03:15:42.170 --> 03:15:44.860
LIAM: I messaged you to open the door for the cat.

4549
03:15:44.860 --> 03:15:46.680
There's a door to this room to the rest of the building.

4550
03:15:46.680 --> 03:15:48.268
You don't have to do it, but that's what--

4551
03:15:48.268 --> 03:15:50.510
SAM: It's upstairs?
LIAM: The room you're in, I think.

4552
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:51.600
MATT: There are two doors, there is the door

4553
03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:52.860
that leads into the chamber that they're in,

4554
03:15:52.860 --> 03:15:54.030
and there's the door that goes upstairs

4555
03:15:54.030 --> 03:15:55.000
in the spiral staircase.

4556
03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:58.014
LIAM: Oh, I have no idea what's in between those two rooms.

4557
03:15:58.014 --> 03:15:59.429
It doesn't matter.

4558
03:15:59.429 --> 03:16:01.020
LAURA: No, no, no, no.

4559
03:16:01.020 --> 03:16:03.140
There's a main shop, there's a door

4560
03:16:03.140 --> 03:16:05.320
to the storage facility, there's a door at the top

4561
03:16:05.320 --> 03:16:06.450
of the stairs.

4562
03:16:06.450 --> 03:16:09.550
So your cat is in the room with the goblin--

4563
03:16:09.550 --> 03:16:10.958
LIAM: We're good.
LAURA: Okay.

4564
03:16:10.958 --> 03:16:11.830
MATT: Cool.

4565
03:16:11.830 --> 03:16:13.260
TALIESIN: Goblin, goblin oil.

4566
03:16:13.260 --> 03:16:14.900
MATT: So you're both grabbing what?

4567
03:16:14.900 --> 03:16:17.190
SAM: Random boxes, random locked boxes.

4568
03:16:17.190 --> 03:16:20.961
MATT: Okay, make a, make sleight of hand checks.

4569
03:16:20.961 --> 03:16:22.011
TRAVIS: Why?

4570
03:16:22.011 --> 03:16:24.053
MARISHA: We're not supposed to be in here.

4571
03:16:24.053 --> 03:16:25.701
SAM: I don't know what else to do.

4572
03:16:25.701 --> 03:16:26.973
TRAVIS: Fucking pull out bison shit--

4573
03:16:26.973 --> 03:16:28.070
MARISHA: 19.

4574
03:16:28.070 --> 03:16:28.910
SAM: 27.

4575
03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:30.850
MATT: 27, and I'd like you both to make stealth checks

4576
03:16:30.850 --> 03:16:33.430
as well, because you're doing this quietly.

4577
03:16:33.430 --> 03:16:34.740
TRAVIS: Can I see them doing this?

4578
03:16:34.740 --> 03:16:37.440
MATT: No, where-- they're in the storage room.

4579
03:16:37.440 --> 03:16:39.530
SAM: 20 something, 29.

4580
03:16:39.530 --> 03:16:40.820
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: 18.

4581
03:16:40.820 --> 03:16:43.707
MATT: Thankfully, because of the loud--

4582
03:16:43.707 --> 03:16:46.280
(Travis wails in falsetto)

4583
03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:49.590
Awkward singing of Fjord, it seems to

4584
03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:51.790
not catch the sound of some of the wood splintering,

4585
03:16:51.790 --> 03:16:54.800
as you crowbar your way into one of the crates.

4586
03:16:54.800 --> 03:16:59.800
You open the inside, and see collections of

4587
03:17:01.230 --> 03:17:02.063
spices.

4588
03:17:04.573 --> 03:17:06.023
LIAM: It's suude.

4589
03:17:07.715 --> 03:17:09.876
Different substances captured in

4590
03:17:09.876 --> 03:17:12.580
jars, in bags, and it's very strong,

4591
03:17:12.580 --> 03:17:16.430
but a different smell from the rest of the chamber.

4592
03:17:16.430 --> 03:17:18.450
You open yours, and on the inside,

4593
03:17:18.450 --> 03:17:21.270
it looks to be this kind of very,

4594
03:17:21.270 --> 03:17:24.400
very fine diamond-like powder.

4595
03:17:26.637 --> 03:17:27.870
SAM: (whispers) Oh, yeah.

4596
03:17:27.870 --> 03:17:31.060
MATT: It has a faint greenish sheen

4597
03:17:31.060 --> 03:17:33.400
to it in certain bits of light.

4598
03:17:33.400 --> 03:17:36.990
SAM: I'm going to take a bunch of that, a bag of that.

4599
03:17:36.990 --> 03:17:40.048
MATT: Okay, so put a--
SAM: A Ziploc bag of that.

4600
03:17:40.048 --> 03:17:40.881
MATT: Make an arcana check.

4601
03:17:40.881 --> 03:17:41.714
LIAM: Snort it.

4602
03:17:43.620 --> 03:17:44.500
SAM: Four.

4603
03:17:44.500 --> 03:17:46.181
MATT: Four, you have no idea what it is.

4604
03:17:46.181 --> 03:17:47.014
(laughs)

4605
03:17:47.014 --> 03:17:49.270
MARISHA: I pocket some spices, just 'cause.

4606
03:17:49.270 --> 03:17:50.940
And then let's get the fuck out of here.

4607
03:17:50.940 --> 03:17:51.773
MATT: Okay.

4608
03:17:51.773 --> 03:17:53.260
SAM: I think we-- mission accomplished.

4609
03:17:53.260 --> 03:17:54.093
MARISHA: I think so, too.

4610
03:17:54.093 --> 03:17:55.255
MATT: All right.

4611
03:17:55.255 --> 03:17:56.913
SAM: On the way out,

4612
03:17:59.195 --> 03:18:03.740
I'm going to slam the window shade as loud as I can,

4613
03:18:03.740 --> 03:18:05.777
after we're out.
MATT: Okay.

4614
03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:09.700
At this point, (laughs)

4615
03:18:09.700 --> 03:18:13.410
Maruo has her hands in the armor,

4616
03:18:13.410 --> 03:18:16.370
has greased up primarily all of the chest,

4617
03:18:16.370 --> 03:18:18.346
and gotten down to the stomach a little bit,

4618
03:18:18.346 --> 03:18:19.570
and is like--

4619
03:18:20.522 --> 03:18:22.083
"And you see, you need

4620
03:18:22.083 --> 03:18:25.022
"to make sure you get all the nooks and--"

4621
03:18:25.022 --> 03:18:27.150
(slamming) "What was that?"

4622
03:18:27.150 --> 03:18:28.830
Turns and pulls the hands out, was about up

4623
03:18:28.830 --> 03:18:30.770
to the elbow in your armor, and goes,

4624
03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:34.426
"Shh, shh, shh, get out, get out, get out."

4625
03:18:34.426 --> 03:18:36.219
TRAVIS: Get out? I'm--
MATT: "Get out!"

4626
03:18:36.219 --> 03:18:38.235
TRAVIS: We leave.

4627
03:18:38.235 --> 03:18:39.630
(crying)

4628
03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:41.221
I run out of the door.

4629
03:18:41.221 --> 03:18:42.110
SAM: Jesus.

4630
03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:44.840
MATT: All right, you guys leave, and she--

4631
03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:47.020
she reaches down beneath the counter for something,

4632
03:18:47.020 --> 03:18:49.060
right as you guys close the door behind you.

4633
03:18:49.060 --> 03:18:50.976
Looking over towards where the sound came from.

4634
03:18:50.976 --> 03:18:52.751
MARISHA: Your cat still in there?
LIAM: Mm-hm.

4635
03:18:52.751 --> 03:18:54.890
The door closes, you're outside.

4636
03:18:54.890 --> 03:18:56.388
SAM: Frumpkin's still in.

4637
03:18:56.388 --> 03:18:57.700
TALIESIN: That's not a problem, though.

4638
03:18:57.700 --> 03:18:58.533
LIAM: Not a problem.

4639
03:18:58.533 --> 03:19:00.143
SAM: But does Frumpkin see anything happening?

4640
03:19:00.143 --> 03:19:01.380
MARISHA: Yeah, what is she grabbing?

4641
03:19:01.380 --> 03:19:03.497
MATT: Perception check for Frumpkin.

4642
03:19:06.230 --> 03:19:08.011
MARISHA: Fucking finally.

4643
03:19:08.011 --> 03:19:10.830
LIAM: It was high before, I just got stopped by a door, 23.

4644
03:19:10.830 --> 03:19:14.620
MATT: Yep, so you watch as the goblin reaches

4645
03:19:14.620 --> 03:19:17.820
underneath the counter, and pulls out

4646
03:19:17.820 --> 03:19:21.240
a regular crossbow that's just

4647
03:19:21.240 --> 03:19:24.168
resting there, cocks it at the ready,

4648
03:19:24.168 --> 03:19:27.243
looks to the corner, and it's empty, and goes--

4649
03:19:27.243 --> 03:19:28.830
LAURA: (gasps)

4650
03:19:28.830 --> 03:19:31.320
MATT: And goes over and turns the lantern down,

4651
03:19:31.320 --> 03:19:32.672
the oil lantern really low.

4652
03:19:35.260 --> 03:19:36.950
Makes a head movement, and you watch as the door--

4653
03:19:36.950 --> 03:19:39.300
(door creaking)

4654
03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:40.924
opens on its own.

4655
03:19:40.924 --> 03:19:44.340
And then brings the crossbow up,

4656
03:19:44.340 --> 03:19:47.100
and enters into the chamber out of sight.

4657
03:19:48.580 --> 03:19:52.150
LIAM: So from my end, and Frumpkin's point of view,

4658
03:19:52.150 --> 03:19:54.630
it looked like an invisible person opened the door?

4659
03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:56.670
MATT: Possibly.
LIAM: Or the door opened, okay.

4660
03:19:58.569 --> 03:20:02.260
All right, we'll just continue to watch for the moment.

4661
03:20:02.260 --> 03:20:05.910
MATT: You hear some rummaging, some more rummaging,

4662
03:20:05.910 --> 03:20:09.090
a few minutes of moving and scuffing feet.

4663
03:20:10.620 --> 03:20:15.150
And you hear a latching, and then Maruo walks out again,

4664
03:20:15.150 --> 03:20:18.350
and is like, "(grumbling)

4665
03:20:21.100 --> 03:20:24.251
"All right, we got to be careful, I don't trust it.

4666
03:20:27.450 --> 03:20:28.283
"Well.

4667
03:20:29.883 --> 03:20:32.133
"I'm going to get to bed. Call in the next shift.

4668
03:20:33.510 --> 03:20:36.360
"I'm closing up shop," and she goes

4669
03:20:36.360 --> 03:20:39.210
and sets the crossbow back underneath the counter,

4670
03:20:40.260 --> 03:20:43.570
walks over, grabs some keys, heads over to the door,

4671
03:20:44.680 --> 03:20:49.540
goes ahead and locks, holds the door open, and you watch as,

4672
03:20:49.540 --> 03:20:51.890
on the far corner, the door closes on its own,

4673
03:20:53.650 --> 03:20:57.160
a figure appears, humanoid, cloaked, hood back,

4674
03:20:58.460 --> 03:21:00.200
is a

4675
03:21:00.200 --> 03:21:03.960
very thin, gaunt-looking bugbear,

4676
03:21:03.960 --> 03:21:08.087
fur trimmed fairly short. Just looks over,

4677
03:21:08.087 --> 03:21:10.300
nods, and follows up, and the two

4678
03:21:10.300 --> 03:21:11.730
of them leave the building.

4679
03:21:11.730 --> 03:21:13.670
The rest of you, are you waiting outside?

4680
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:17.220
LAURA: No, I mean, yeah, me and Fjord are kind

4681
03:21:17.220 --> 03:21:19.845
of standing around you know.

4682
03:21:19.845 --> 03:21:20.830
LIAM: Did you say that Maruo

4683
03:21:20.830 --> 03:21:22.740
and the bugbear left the building at the end of that, is

4684
03:21:22.740 --> 03:21:25.720
that what you said, or just the gang leaves the building?

4685
03:21:25.720 --> 03:21:27.080
MATT: The gang leaves the building,

4686
03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:28.940
Maruo and the bugbear leave for a second,

4687
03:21:28.940 --> 03:21:30.330
but the bugbear stays out there in front.

4688
03:21:30.330 --> 03:21:31.996
LIAM: Stays, stays--
MATT: Holding the door, yeah.

4689
03:21:31.996 --> 03:21:34.240
LIAM: And has dropped its invisibility?

4690
03:21:34.240 --> 03:21:35.073
MATT: For the time being, it seems.

4691
03:21:35.073 --> 03:21:36.190
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4692
03:21:37.850 --> 03:21:41.020
SAM: Was the invisible thing in the room with us?

4693
03:21:41.020 --> 03:21:42.170
LIAM: Yeah, it was in the shop.

4694
03:21:42.170 --> 03:21:43.600
SAM: Oh, shit. We got made.

4695
03:21:44.950 --> 03:21:47.605
TALIESIN: Oh, no, it was--
LIAM: It was in the shop.

4696
03:21:47.605 --> 03:21:50.992
MATT: Oh, sorry, it was in the shop, not with you.

4697
03:21:50.992 --> 03:21:53.050
MARISHA: Because she didn't act like she knew anything.

4698
03:21:53.050 --> 03:21:55.400
She's got invisible help in that room.

4699
03:21:56.870 --> 03:21:57.790
LIAM: Okay, so--

4700
03:21:57.790 --> 03:21:59.461
MARISHA: It's great to know.
SAM: Yeah.

4701
03:21:59.461 --> 03:22:01.795
LIAM: Frumpkin poofs out,

4702
03:22:01.795 --> 03:22:03.470
and then I fill everybody in on what I saw.

4703
03:22:03.470 --> 03:22:05.830
MATT: Okay, you guys left the building, though?

4704
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:06.970
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, we've--

4705
03:22:06.970 --> 03:22:08.448
TALIESIN: Took a walk around.
MATT: Okay, reconvene.

4706
03:22:08.448 --> 03:22:10.615
SAM: Back to the Xhorhouse.

4707
03:22:11.660 --> 03:22:12.530
LAURA: Oh, shit.

4708
03:22:13.580 --> 03:22:15.470
TALIESIN: Well, that's good to know.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4709
03:22:15.470 --> 03:22:18.210
SAM: And I got this shiny stuff.
LAURA: Woo, what is it?

4710
03:22:18.210 --> 03:22:19.050
SAM: I don't know.

4711
03:22:19.050 --> 03:22:20.630
LAURA: Maybe it's gem dust.

4712
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:22.730
MARISHA: I got spices.

4713
03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:24.970
TALIESIN: What kind of spices?
MARISHA: I don't know.

4714
03:22:24.970 --> 03:22:26.020
ASHLEY: You're so shiny, Fjord.

4715
03:22:26.020 --> 03:22:28.290
LAURA: Caleb, Caleb, Caleb, is it magic, is it magic?

4716
03:22:28.290 --> 03:22:29.123
Caleb, look at it.

4717
03:22:29.123 --> 03:22:31.950
LIAM: I will take a look at it, yeah.

4718
03:22:31.950 --> 03:22:33.490
TALIESIN: That's 17.

4719
03:22:33.490 --> 03:22:37.710
MATT: 17, okay. It is not natural,

4720
03:22:37.710 --> 03:22:40.748
at least it isn't in its current form.

4721
03:22:40.748 --> 03:22:43.557
SAM: Synthetic?
MARISHA: Drugs?

4722
03:22:43.557 --> 03:22:46.240
MATT: It's processed in some way. You're not

4723
03:22:46.240 --> 03:22:47.880
too sure of the material.

4724
03:22:47.880 --> 03:22:50.450
In your world experience, I'd say you're actually not sure

4725
03:22:50.450 --> 03:22:51.283
what it is.

4726
03:22:51.283 --> 03:22:53.750
TALIESIN: I have no idea what this is; it's weird.

4727
03:22:53.750 --> 03:22:56.992
MARISHA: It's spice. I bet it's suude. It's got to be drugs.

4728
03:22:58.910 --> 03:23:00.225
MATT: Go ahead and make a--

4729
03:23:00.225 --> 03:23:01.775
MARISHA: Yeah, and with my criminal background,

4730
03:23:01.775 --> 03:23:02.691
would I know?

4731
03:23:02.691 --> 03:23:03.750
MATT: Actually, no, with your criminal background,

4732
03:23:03.750 --> 03:23:04.583
you would know exactly what it is.

4733
03:23:04.583 --> 03:23:05.416
Yeah, it's suude.

4734
03:23:05.416 --> 03:23:08.149
SAM: Oh, it's suude?
MARISHA: It is suude?

4735
03:23:08.149 --> 03:23:10.776
(laughter)

4736
03:23:10.776 --> 03:23:11.884
TRAVIS: Spice is nice!

4737
03:23:11.884 --> 03:23:14.767
TALIESIN: You demanded the crossover, it's finally happened.

4738
03:23:14.767 --> 03:23:17.827
TRAVIS: Holy shit.
(laughter)

4739
03:23:17.827 --> 03:23:21.980
The Mighty Nein proceed to get fucked up all night!

4740
03:23:21.980 --> 03:23:24.710
TALIESIN: So did we just find, like,

4741
03:23:24.710 --> 03:23:27.000
basically, oh my god, we just found,

4742
03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:29.060
like, oh my god, it's a fucking front.

4743
03:23:29.060 --> 03:23:29.893
MARISHA: It's a front.

4744
03:23:29.893 --> 03:23:31.150
TALIESIN: Oh my god, its a fucking front.

4745
03:23:31.150 --> 03:23:33.130
TRAVIS: Well, what's the--
MARISHA: Nothing in the store--

4746
03:23:33.130 --> 03:23:34.530
LIAM: Well, first, I'm just going to make a--

4747
03:23:34.530 --> 03:23:37.410
see if it rings a bell with my arcane knowledge.

4748
03:23:37.410 --> 03:23:39.213
TALIESIN: I am the bugbear that knocks.

4749
03:23:39.213 --> 03:23:40.080
LIAM: The powder.

4750
03:23:40.080 --> 03:23:42.291
MATT: Yeah, make an arcana check.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

4751
03:23:42.291 --> 03:23:45.936
(laughter)

4752
03:23:45.936 --> 03:23:48.183
LIAM: What is that, a natural 20.

4753
03:23:48.183 --> 03:23:50.870
MATT: Oh, shit.
LAURA: Oh, well.

4754
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:53.770
MATT: It is a pouch of residuum, powdered residuum.

4755
03:23:53.770 --> 03:23:55.370
TALIESIN: Out of character: I knew it.

4756
03:23:55.370 --> 03:23:58.402
SAM: Residuum?
LAURA and LIAM: Whitestone.

4757
03:23:58.402 --> 03:24:01.760
SAM: Ah! It's all coming together.

4758
03:24:01.760 --> 03:24:03.390
MATT: This particular--

4759
03:24:03.390 --> 03:24:05.040
so residuum will take different forms.

4760
03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:08.410
This is ground whitestone.

4761
03:24:08.410 --> 03:24:10.710
It looks to be probably the equivalent,

4762
03:24:10.710 --> 03:24:12.730
or what could be utilized up

4763
03:24:12.730 --> 03:24:15.720
to about 1,000 gold worth of enchanting.

4764
03:24:15.720 --> 03:24:18.570
LIAM: Does this mean I'm vaguely familiar with Whitestone?

4765
03:24:18.570 --> 03:24:20.310
MATT: It means you've heard of it.

4766
03:24:20.310 --> 03:24:23.470
I mean, the source of this particular residuum,

4767
03:24:24.410 --> 03:24:26.110
it comes from one location, and is very sought after.

4768
03:24:26.110 --> 03:24:30.040
Which is why the locale was so carefully guarded

4769
03:24:30.040 --> 03:24:32.990
once Whitestone began to rise back to prominence.

4770
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:35.480
LIAM: And since I was just a guy who stabbed things before,

4771
03:24:35.480 --> 03:24:39.060
but now I'm a wizard: what would I use 1,000 gold worth

4772
03:24:39.060 --> 03:24:40.960
of enchanting power for?

4773
03:24:40.960 --> 03:24:43.030
MATT: To enchant objects.

4774
03:24:43.030 --> 03:24:44.850
LIAM: I, myself, can do that?
MATT: Yes.

4775
03:24:44.850 --> 03:24:46.700
LIAM: I used to be a rogue, I don't know what's going on.

4776
03:24:46.700 --> 03:24:48.970
MATT: Yeah, I know, no, you can

4777
03:24:48.970 --> 03:24:50.440
create your own magical items,

4778
03:24:50.440 --> 03:24:52.170
if you'd like to. You don't have to find an enchanter

4779
03:24:52.170 --> 03:24:55.820
to do it. You can, it just takes time and money to do so,

4780
03:24:55.820 --> 03:24:58.370
and certain spells that can be adjacent

4781
03:24:58.370 --> 03:25:00.200
to the kind of magic you want to create.

4782
03:25:00.200 --> 03:25:01.420
ASHLEY: I know.

4783
03:25:01.420 --> 03:25:02.253
LIAM: Hmm?

4784
03:25:02.253 --> 03:25:04.910
ASHLEY: I should have had you, I didn't realize--

4785
03:25:04.910 --> 03:25:06.540
LAURA: You could go get your money back,

4786
03:25:06.540 --> 03:25:08.110
it's only a couple days, maybe.

4787
03:25:09.445 --> 03:25:10.718
SAM: Oh.

4788
03:25:10.718 --> 03:25:12.470
LIAM: Or maybe we go down that path for you,

4789
03:25:12.470 --> 03:25:15.512
and I can make sure that I don't get my head shot off.

4790
03:25:16.659 --> 03:25:17.778
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4791
03:25:17.778 --> 03:25:19.740
We'll think about it, it's not a bad idea.

4792
03:25:19.740 --> 03:25:20.865
TALIESIN: It also might be able,

4793
03:25:20.865 --> 03:25:23.210
this stuff might also work with

4794
03:25:23.210 --> 03:25:25.150
putting the sword back together, possibly.

4795
03:25:25.150 --> 03:25:27.000
MATT: Possibly.

4796
03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:28.300
Residuum is multipurpose.

4797
03:25:28.300 --> 03:25:31.867
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's just magical potential.

4798
03:25:31.867 --> 03:25:33.700
LIAM: Yeah, I also don't own it; it is the group's.

4799
03:25:33.700 --> 03:25:34.533
LAURA: Yes, it is.

4800
03:25:34.533 --> 03:25:37.699
It's actually Nott's because she found it.

4801
03:25:37.699 --> 03:25:40.550
SAM: I gave it to Caleb. Anything I have is Caleb's.

4802
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:42.520
MATT: You take some in your hand, if you want to.

4803
03:25:42.520 --> 03:25:45.410
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: No, it's mine.

4804
03:25:45.410 --> 03:25:47.950
MATT: It's a very, very, very faint glow

4805
03:25:47.950 --> 03:25:49.060
that might be psychosomatic,

4806
03:25:49.060 --> 03:25:50.250
but nevertheless, you're excited.

4807
03:25:50.250 --> 03:25:51.940
TALIESIN: I pull out my black light. I'm going to charge it.

4808
03:25:51.940 --> 03:25:54.434
Does it glow now?
(laughter)

4809
03:25:54.434 --> 03:25:55.267
TRAVIS: "Charge it."

4810
03:25:56.400 --> 03:25:58.560
MATT: All right, you guys have reconvened at the,

4811
03:25:58.560 --> 03:26:00.468
is that a name you're choosing for it now?

4812
03:26:01.517 --> 03:26:02.760
MARISHA: The Xhorhouse.
MATT: The Xhorhouse?

4813
03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:04.605
SAM: The Xhorhouse or the tree house.

4814
03:26:04.605 --> 03:26:09.130
ASHLEY, then ALL: ♪ Xhorhouse in the middle of our street ♪

4815
03:26:09.130 --> 03:26:11.600
MATT: I mean, what else can it be now?

4816
03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:12.890
TALIESIN: And it's locked.

4817
03:26:12.890 --> 03:26:14.930
LIAM: What about the MT house?

4818
03:26:14.930 --> 03:26:16.321
SAM: What's the MT--
LIAM: The MT house.

4819
03:26:16.321 --> 03:26:18.245
The Mollymauk Tealeaf house.

4820
03:26:18.245 --> 03:26:22.367
The MT home.
TALIESIN: I mean, I really like that.

4821
03:26:22.367 --> 03:26:25.763
MATT: It could always be the Xhorhouse with the MT Spa.

4822
03:26:25.763 --> 03:26:27.318
(oohing)

4823
03:26:27.318 --> 03:26:28.151
I think he'd appreciate that.

4824
03:26:28.151 --> 03:26:28.984
LAURA: What if it's just

4825
03:26:28.984 --> 03:26:32.800
Jester's House of Sexy Time and Sweets?

4826
03:26:32.800 --> 03:26:34.730
TALIESIN: MT House, it's got a good vibe.

4827
03:26:34.730 --> 03:26:37.533
TRAVIS: And sweets?

4828
03:26:37.533 --> 03:26:39.628
ASHLEY: I want to go there.

4829
03:26:39.628 --> 03:26:40.630
TALIESIN: It's also good, because it'll make it easier

4830
03:26:40.630 --> 03:26:41.780
to be sly about it.

4831
03:26:41.780 --> 03:26:44.010
TRAVIS: Come to have sex, and have donuts.

4832
03:26:44.010 --> 03:26:45.430
MATT: What do you guys want to do?

4833
03:26:45.430 --> 03:26:46.930
LAURA: What's our what?

4834
03:26:47.868 --> 03:26:48.701
MATT: You don't have to decide now,

4835
03:26:48.701 --> 03:26:49.534
but you have to at some point.

4836
03:26:49.534 --> 03:26:51.180
LAURA: Xhorhouse.
LIAM: MT home.

4837
03:26:51.180 --> 03:26:53.455
LAURA: Xhorhouse with the MT Home Spa.

4838
03:26:55.260 --> 03:26:56.960
LIAM: MT Home, with the Xhorhouse Spa.

4839
03:26:58.143 --> 03:26:59.183
TALIESIN: The clown room.

4840
03:26:59.183 --> 03:27:00.570
LAURA: ♪ Xhorhouse! ♪

4841
03:27:00.570 --> 03:27:02.370
MATT: You deliberate it over time.

4842
03:27:02.370 --> 03:27:03.970
MARISHA: It will present itself--

4843
03:27:03.970 --> 03:27:07.950
MATT: Regardless, you have two days before this time period.

4844
03:27:07.950 --> 03:27:08.820
Anything else you guys want to do,

4845
03:27:08.820 --> 03:27:10.810
or are you just running out the clock?

4846
03:27:10.810 --> 03:27:12.890
TALIESIN: Other than--

4847
03:27:12.890 --> 03:27:15.153
MARISHA: You want to try and scry on this guy again?

4848
03:27:16.210 --> 03:27:19.802
TALIESIN: Next day, but that, also, that burns a 5th-level.

4849
03:27:19.802 --> 03:27:23.030
LIAM: It does, but it's the day before the stakeout.

4850
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:25.470
MARISHA: Are there, do, could we get a,

4851
03:27:25.470 --> 03:27:28.380
could I walk around and figure out the inns

4852
03:27:28.380 --> 03:27:30.350
and the motels in the area?

4853
03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:35.270
MATT: In which area? The Coronas, the Gallimaufry?

4854
03:27:35.270 --> 03:27:37.170
It's a big city, and there are a lot.

4855
03:27:37.170 --> 03:27:39.220
MARISHA: There are a lot. What's the nearest--

4856
03:27:39.220 --> 03:27:41.330
LAURA: Is it possible, I don't know.

4857
03:27:41.330 --> 03:27:43.280
MARISHA: Hmm?
LAURA: Nothing.

4858
03:27:43.280 --> 03:27:44.630
Like, we had the map of Emon,

4859
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:47.313
I wonder if it's possible to get a map of--

4860
03:27:48.420 --> 03:27:49.253
MARISHA: Rosohna?

4861
03:27:49.253 --> 03:27:50.086
MATT: You're looking for a map?

4862
03:27:50.086 --> 03:27:52.350
TALIESIN: That'd be nice.

4863
03:27:52.350 --> 03:27:55.410
It'd be good for the-- and then we could stop calling it

4864
03:27:55.410 --> 03:27:57.300
the war room, and call it the map room.

4865
03:27:57.300 --> 03:27:59.680
MATT: You can make an investigation check, if you want to.

4866
03:27:59.680 --> 03:28:01.261
TALIESIN: I'm not going to make an investigation--

4867
03:28:01.261 --> 03:28:02.840
SAM: Is there any point in bringing some

4868
03:28:02.840 --> 03:28:05.070
of this residuum to the person who's trying

4869
03:28:05.070 --> 03:28:07.900
to make Yasha's thing?
LAURA: 19.

4870
03:28:07.900 --> 03:28:10.820
MATT: There are no cartographers, necessarily,

4871
03:28:10.820 --> 03:28:14.850
but you do find general store. You ask this one

4872
03:28:14.850 --> 03:28:16.660
wayward lizard man in the corner

4873
03:28:16.660 --> 03:28:19.970
who has a small clutch. He's like,

4874
03:28:19.970 --> 03:28:22.850
"Maps, nothing of this city, I'm afraid, but

4875
03:28:24.079 --> 03:28:26.380
"a scout dropped this off not long ago.

4876
03:28:27.280 --> 03:28:30.380
"Not of the city, but,

4877
03:28:30.380 --> 03:28:32.760
"at least of the vicinity."
LAURA: What is it?

4878
03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:35.640
MATT: "That's a map of Xhorhas."

4879
03:28:35.640 --> 03:28:37.290
LAURA: That's would be wonderful, too.

4880
03:28:39.600 --> 03:28:41.960
MATT: "15 gold pieces."

4881
03:28:41.960 --> 03:28:44.880
TALIESIN: A steal at twice the price.

4882
03:28:44.880 --> 03:28:46.860
LAURA: Okay, yeah, 15 gold sounds good.

4883
03:28:48.148 --> 03:28:49.993
TALIESIN: Do you need to borrow any?
SAM: Clink! Plink!

4884

TALIESIN: You all right?

4885
03:28:50.826 --> 03:28:53.370
LAURA: What?
MATT: "It's a bit used."

4887
03:28:55.216 --> 03:28:56.049

TRAVIS: I thought you were just gesturing.

4889
03:28:57.150 --> 03:29:00.627
LAURA: It's slightly used, there's blood on this thing.

4890

03:30:08.518 --> 03:30:09.980
TALIESIN: There's a lot--
SAM: Vermaloc Wildwood.

4925
03:30:09.980 --> 03:30:11.270
Asarius. Oh, we've been there.

4926
03:30:11.270 --> 03:30:12.230
LIAM: Whose blood is that?

4927
03:30:12.230 --> 03:30:14.200
SAM: Is this all of Xhorhas?

4928
03:30:14.200 --> 03:30:16.230
MATT: At least on the map.

4929
03:30:16.230 --> 03:30:17.560
SAM: Whoa!

4930
03:30:17.560 --> 03:30:19.400
LAURA: And which way is the Empire?

4931
03:30:19.400 --> 03:30:21.222
LIAM: That way.
LAURA: Okay.

4932
03:30:22.150 --> 03:30:23.870
LIAM: We're here.

4933
03:30:23.870 --> 03:30:25.669
LAURA: Whoa, we're really far in.
SAM: Yeah,

4934
03:30:25.669 --> 03:30:27.010
we're as far in as you can get.

4935
03:30:27.010 --> 03:30:27.843
MARISHA: Into the map.

4936
03:30:29.100 --> 03:30:30.750
SAM: Is there a coast--

4937
03:30:30.750 --> 03:30:32.230
LAURA: Wait, let's go over here.

4938
03:30:32.230 --> 03:30:34.260
MATT: It looks like there might be, based on the map.

4939
03:30:34.260 --> 03:30:35.670
SAM: But over the mountains, there's a--

4940
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:37.480
MATT: It looks like there might be, yeah.

4941
03:30:37.480 --> 03:30:38.685
LIAM: That's Pennsylvania.

4942
03:30:38.685 --> 03:30:40.567
MATT: You could always ask around.

4943
03:30:40.567 --> 03:30:42.030
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4944
03:30:42.030 --> 03:30:43.040
MARISHA: All right, well, that's cool.

4945
03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:46.940
LIAM: Yeah, very cool.
SAM: Oh, wow.

4946
03:30:46.940 --> 03:30:50.102
TALIESIN: I mean, we could just try and mend the sword.

4947
03:30:51.151 --> 03:30:52.076
MATT: If you're curious about something on the map,

4948
03:30:52.076 --> 03:30:54.840
you could always ask the locals.

4949
03:30:54.840 --> 03:30:56.460
SAM: Hey, Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah?

4950
03:30:56.460 --> 03:30:58.380
SAM: We're giving the whitestone residuum

4951
03:30:58.380 --> 03:31:03.110
to the person who's enchanting Yasha's things?

4952
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:04.510
LIAM: Quite possibly.
SAM: And help?

4953
03:31:04.510 --> 03:31:06.560
TALIESIN: Would they ask where it came from?

4954
03:31:06.560 --> 03:31:07.393
LIAM: Quite possibly.

4955
03:31:07.393 --> 03:31:09.368
LAURA: ♪ Islands in the stream ♪

4956
03:31:10.321 --> 03:31:11.510
MARISHA: I have a feeling the trade of this type

4957
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:14.442
of thing is consider contraband.

4958
03:31:14.442 --> 03:31:15.350
LIAM: What I recommend is that we follow

4959
03:31:15.350 --> 03:31:20.100
that path for Yasha, and decide what we do with the rest.

4960
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:23.770
SAM: Jessie.
LAURA: Hmm, yeah?

4961
03:31:23.770 --> 03:31:28.770
SAM: Can you call, can you ringy dingy Shakäste for me?

4962
03:31:29.130 --> 03:31:32.720
Just find out if he's in Alfield, that'll be a help,

4963
03:31:33.650 --> 03:31:37.368
and free for a mission.
LAURA: Okay.

4964
03:31:38.830 --> 03:31:40.220
SAM: Yes, Matt.

4965
03:31:40.220 --> 03:31:42.122
MATT: I'm sorry, Khary.

4966
03:31:44.010 --> 03:31:44.843
LAURA: Okay.

4967
03:31:47.090 --> 03:31:49.770
Hi, it's Jester.

4968
03:31:51.718 --> 03:31:54.400
Miss you so much! Are you still in Alfield?

4969
03:31:54.400 --> 03:31:58.020
If you are, are you free to help us out?

4970
03:31:59.080 --> 03:32:01.041
There's a little boy--
TRAVIS: "There a little--"

4971
03:32:01.041 --> 03:32:01.990
LAURA: Fuck.

4972
03:32:04.530 --> 03:32:07.460
MATT: "Hey, Jester, baby, been a while.

4973
03:32:09.650 --> 03:32:12.850
"Not in Alfield, but still trudging around the Empire.

4974
03:32:16.205 --> 03:32:20.000
"What's little?"
(laughter)

4975
03:32:21.590 --> 03:32:22.423
LAURA: Okay.

4976
03:32:25.820 --> 03:32:27.470
There's a little boy in Alfield

4977
03:32:29.480 --> 03:32:34.350
who could use help getting to

4978
03:32:34.350 --> 03:32:37.380
my mom in Nicodranas.
SAM: For money.

4979
03:32:37.380 --> 03:32:38.640
LAURA: For money, if you want.

4980
03:32:39.510 --> 03:32:41.360
TRAVIS: There's seven more, six more words.

4981
03:32:42.675 --> 03:32:45.200
LAURA: Also, I really think you're wonderful.

4982
03:32:48.230 --> 03:32:49.230
MATT: "I appreciate that.

4983
03:32:52.340 --> 03:32:54.700
"I'll take no money for my help,

4984
03:32:54.700 --> 03:32:58.250
"but if there's a boy in trouble, and it's for my friends,

4985
03:32:59.460 --> 03:33:00.993
"how could I say no?"

4986
03:33:02.046 --> 03:33:02.879
SAM: That's good, that's good.

4987
03:33:02.879 --> 03:33:04.508
MATT: "Give me a week of travel."

4988
03:33:04.508 --> 03:33:09.259
LIAM and LAURA: Shakäste.

4989
03:33:09.259 --> 03:33:10.092
SAM: Okay.

4990
03:33:10.092 --> 03:33:12.240
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Shakäste, you're so wonderful.

4991
03:33:12.240 --> 03:33:16.100
A week of travel, you got it, his name is Luc.

4992
03:33:16.100 --> 03:33:16.933
SAM: He's with Edith.

4993
03:33:16.933 --> 03:33:19.450
LAURA: He's with Edith, and Bryce is looking after him.

4994
03:33:21.705 --> 03:33:23.097
LIAM: It's like Operation.

4995
03:33:24.720 --> 03:33:26.827
MATT: "Well, I guess I better start packing."

4996
03:33:26.827 --> 03:33:27.660
LAURA: Ooh!

4997
03:33:28.742 --> 03:33:30.605
All your problems are solved.

4998
03:33:30.605 --> 03:33:32.229
SAM: Well, it's a week, but okay.

4999
03:33:33.450 --> 03:33:36.190
MATT: Still responding, he says, "You're lucky you caught me

5000
03:33:36.190 --> 03:33:38.420
"at this time, things have been

5001
03:33:39.790 --> 03:33:40.623
"busy."

5002
03:33:43.160 --> 03:33:45.370
That's the last you hear.

5003
03:33:45.370 --> 03:33:47.470
LAURA: He said things are sounding busy there.

5004
03:33:47.470 --> 03:33:49.610
Man, I bet things are getting crazy.

5005
03:33:49.610 --> 03:33:54.210
SAM: His voice is even sexy secondhand, it's amazing.

5006
03:33:54.210 --> 03:33:55.282
MATT: I'm so sorry, Khary.

5007
03:33:55.282 --> 03:33:56.980
SAM: Amazing.

5008
03:33:56.980 --> 03:33:58.970
LAURA: He called me baby.
SAM: Oof!

5009
03:33:58.970 --> 03:34:02.035
LAURA: Yeah, I know.
SAM: Ooh!

5010
03:34:02.035 --> 03:34:05.859
TRAVIS: Jesus. Minotaur and Shakäste.
LIAM: No minotaur, but

5011
03:34:05.859 --> 03:34:08.442
(laughter)

5012
03:34:10.446 --> 03:34:11.520
SAM: All right.

5013
03:34:11.520 --> 03:34:12.353
LAURA: We should scry

5014
03:34:13.560 --> 03:34:14.470
on our--
SAM: Didn't we do that again?

5015
03:34:14.470 --> 03:34:16.030
LAURA: No, we haven't scried on him again.

5016
03:34:16.030 --> 03:34:16.940
SAM: Scry again.

5017
03:34:16.940 --> 03:34:18.300
MATT: All right, who's trying it?

5018
03:34:18.300 --> 03:34:19.290
SAM: If first you don't succeed.

5019
03:34:19.290 --> 03:34:20.300
LAURA: I'm going to try it, I guess.

5020
03:34:22.350 --> 03:34:26.130
MATT: Taking the pieces once more,

5021
03:34:27.330 --> 03:34:29.430
natural one.
LAURA: Yes.

5022
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:32.530
MARISHA: Fuck yes.
MATT: Okay.

5023
03:34:32.530 --> 03:34:34.330
MARISHA: Talk to me.

5024
03:34:35.390 --> 03:34:39.160
MATT: So you close your eyes, sitting in the circle,

5025
03:34:40.540 --> 03:34:43.110
you feel these fingers grab the end of your hands,

5026
03:34:45.360 --> 03:34:47.830
and you open your eyes, just a second,

5027
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:50.990
and you're not in your room more than you're

5028
03:34:50.990 --> 03:34:52.710
in a white amorphous space,

5029
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:55.280
and there you see the green cloaked visage of

5030
03:34:55.280 --> 03:34:57.260
the Traveler holding your hands, as he

5031
03:34:57.260 --> 03:35:00.940
leans forward and says, "Let me show you."

5032
03:35:00.940 --> 03:35:01.860
LAURA: Okay.

5033
03:35:01.860 --> 03:35:06.250
MATT: You watch his body vanish into the ether,

5034
03:35:06.250 --> 03:35:07.970
surrounded by grayish white clouds,

5035
03:35:07.970 --> 03:35:10.340
you're not sure which way is up, down,

5036
03:35:10.340 --> 03:35:12.380
and your eyes feel like they're unfocused,

5037
03:35:12.380 --> 03:35:13.620
like there's something in them, like a film,

5038
03:35:13.620 --> 03:35:15.180
like you just woke up after a long sleep.

5039
03:35:15.180 --> 03:35:16.690
As you rub your eyes,

5040
03:35:16.690 --> 03:35:18.600
and you open them again, you're now inside

5041
03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:20.242
of a darkened chamber.

5042
03:35:21.890 --> 03:35:24.450
The blonde figure is there in front of you,

5043
03:35:24.450 --> 03:35:26.780
standing at the back of this chamber,

5044
03:35:26.780 --> 03:35:29.670
like a long hall, you can hear voices echoing,

5045
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:31.510
so it's a big interior.

5046
03:35:32.640 --> 03:35:36.990
Looking just by the wall that he's at, there's

5047
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:39.037
fine dark wood

5048
03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:43.210
laid against it, there is a patterned wallpaper,

5049
03:35:43.210 --> 03:35:45.330
and there is a wall-mounted candelabra,

5050
03:35:45.330 --> 03:35:50.330
like, two feet to his right that is flickering flame.

5051
03:35:50.470 --> 03:35:51.761
You see him

5052
03:35:53.100 --> 03:35:55.220
with a book, a small one,

5053
03:35:55.220 --> 03:35:57.240
like a little journal type thing, has it open,

5054
03:35:57.240 --> 03:35:59.800
and is currently writing and looking forward.

5055
03:36:01.350 --> 03:36:05.130
You get the sense that he's essentially taking notes.

5056
03:36:07.100 --> 03:36:09.050
Make a perception check.

5057
03:36:09.050 --> 03:36:10.950
LAURA: And he's facing outward, the wall behind--

5058
03:36:10.950 --> 03:36:12.200
MATT: Correct, the wall's behind him,

5059
03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:14.150
and he's facing outward, and taking notes.

5060
03:36:17.160 --> 03:36:18.110
LAURA: Ten.

5061
03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:21.400
MATT: Ten, okay, you only pick up some of the conversation.

5062
03:36:21.400 --> 03:36:22.233
You hear

5063
03:36:23.200 --> 03:36:25.720
words being said, and it's kind of muffled,

5064
03:36:25.720 --> 03:36:28.610
and occasionally, the voice will raise a bit,

5065
03:36:28.610 --> 03:36:30.330
as things get a little more intense,

5066
03:36:30.330 --> 03:36:32.530
and you pick out a few phrases, you pick up,

5067
03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:37.370
"Mobilizing three legions

5068
03:36:37.370 --> 03:36:40.130
"to hold the Ashguard Garrison back, while our scouts watch

5069
03:36:40.130 --> 03:36:42.280
"the crests of the Ashkeepers for movement."

5070
03:36:44.590 --> 03:36:46.900
The rest of it's just (mumbling),

5071
03:36:46.900 --> 03:36:49.090
other voices going around, and other voices.

5072
03:36:50.010 --> 03:36:53.100
Another voice calls out, "We've Righteous Brand

5073
03:36:53.100 --> 03:36:55.350
"on guard at every major cavern network.

5074
03:36:55.350 --> 03:36:56.520
"While we outnumber their forces,

5075
03:36:56.520 --> 03:36:59.400
"they are wily with their use of passages beneath the world

5076
03:36:59.400 --> 03:37:03.089
"that can strike in small numbers nearly anywhere."

5077
03:37:03.089 --> 03:37:04.330
MARISHA: Yeah.

5078
03:37:04.330 --> 03:37:07.130
MATT: You hear some more conversation, some muttering,

5079
03:37:08.180 --> 03:37:10.070
and then a voice say,

5080
03:37:10.070 --> 03:37:12.060
"Send more declarations for coin

5081
03:37:12.060 --> 03:37:14.590
"for loyal hands to the cities of the coast.

5082
03:37:15.740 --> 03:37:17.130
"I should like a word with the Concord

5083
03:37:17.130 --> 03:37:19.125
"on calling in some favors.

5084
03:37:21.060 --> 03:37:24.270
"When the armies are upon us, release the Scourgers,

5085
03:37:25.210 --> 03:37:27.110
"this destruction will be what we need."

5086
03:37:29.010 --> 03:37:31.102
"Yes, my liege." "Yes, my liege."

5087
03:37:33.390 --> 03:37:35.050
As the figures that are blurred

5088
03:37:35.050 --> 03:37:37.390
in the distance off the cusp of this vision turn

5089
03:37:37.390 --> 03:37:41.002
and begin to walk toward it, the vision flickers,

5090
03:37:41.002 --> 03:37:43.960
striates, and then vanishes. Something seems

5091
03:37:43.960 --> 03:37:48.340
to intercept and prevent the spell from searching,

5092
03:37:48.340 --> 03:37:51.140
as these figures approach the source of your scry.

5093
03:37:53.450 --> 03:37:55.020
Forcefully, you're ejected from the vision,

5094
03:37:55.020 --> 03:37:57.253
and find yourself back in your room.

5095
03:37:57.253 --> 03:37:58.428
LAURA: (coughing)

5096
03:38:01.496 --> 03:38:03.090
TRAVIS: Are you all right, Jester?

5097
03:38:03.090 --> 03:38:05.400
LAURA: Yeah, something just pushed me out.

5098
03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:06.630
LIAM: What do you mean?

5099
03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:09.350
LAURA: Like, like somebody

5100
03:38:09.350 --> 03:38:11.200
got in the way of the scry, you know?

5101
03:38:12.318 --> 03:38:14.730
Like, they, they canceled it.

5102
03:38:14.730 --> 03:38:17.430
LIAM: Caleb starts fingering the necklace around his neck.

5103
03:38:18.720 --> 03:38:21.130
LAURA: I tell them everything that I heard,

5104
03:38:21.130 --> 03:38:22.790
and I draw the picture, you know,

5105
03:38:22.790 --> 03:38:25.330
of the wallpaper, and the candelabra of the,

5106
03:38:26.308 --> 03:38:28.990
I don't know if it means anything, but.

5107
03:38:28.990 --> 03:38:30.620
MATT: You don't recognize the wallpaper specifically,

5108
03:38:30.620 --> 03:38:32.559
but each of you do realize the patterns

5109
03:38:32.559 --> 03:38:37.480
of it some to be Dwendalian.
LIAM: Yeah.

5110
03:38:38.456 --> 03:38:40.320
MATT: But the location doesn't ring a bell.

5111
03:38:41.270 --> 03:38:43.390
LAURA: He sounded, they said, "My liege."

5112
03:38:43.390 --> 03:38:44.660
SAM: To the blondie?

5113
03:38:44.660 --> 03:38:46.300
LAURA: No, no, no, he was taking notes,

5114
03:38:46.300 --> 03:38:49.525
they said my liege to the guy that he was looking at.

5115
03:38:50.410 --> 03:38:53.370
SAM: And they, they are Empire folks?

5116
03:38:53.370 --> 03:38:55.570
LAURA: It was definitely Empire,

5117
03:38:55.570 --> 03:38:59.620
apparently they're hiring the Gold Chain people to be, like,

5118
03:38:59.620 --> 03:39:04.590
an army for them. They're really badass warriors, right?

5119
03:39:04.590 --> 03:39:05.423
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5120
03:39:05.423 --> 03:39:07.490
TALIESIN: Are we entirely sure we should be keeping this

5121
03:39:07.490 --> 03:39:09.370
to ourselves?

5122
03:39:09.370 --> 03:39:12.000
MARISHA: Mention the Scourgers as a distraction,

5123
03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:14.290
which is exactly what I was afraid of,

5124
03:39:14.290 --> 03:39:18.240
that they were doing by opening these rifts to the Abyss.

5125
03:39:18.240 --> 03:39:20.360
SAM: Oh, is that what the Scourgers are, the rifts?

5126
03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:21.840
MARISHA: That's what I'm guessing.
TRAVIS: Could be.

5127
03:39:21.840 --> 03:39:23.770
SAM: They also mention specific attacks

5128
03:39:23.770 --> 03:39:25.810
at specific places, right?

5129
03:39:25.810 --> 03:39:26.870
MARISHA: Ashguard.

5130
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:31.150
SAM: We could, we could warn the Dynasty

5131
03:39:31.150 --> 03:39:33.390
of these specific attacks.

5132
03:39:33.390 --> 03:39:35.120
LAURA: So we want to?

5133
03:39:35.120 --> 03:39:36.220
SAM: We could save lives.

5134
03:39:39.128 --> 03:39:40.660
LAURA: Well, it would save--
LIAM: On which side?

5135
03:39:41.520 --> 03:39:43.330
MATT: Make a history check, both

5136
03:39:45.110 --> 03:39:47.945
Caleb and Beauregard.

5137
03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:51.970
LIAM: Balls.
SAM: Come on, Beau.

5138
03:39:51.970 --> 03:39:55.090
MARISHA: Natural 20!

5139
03:39:55.090 --> 03:39:56.773
Ugh, I've been feeling real bad

5140
03:39:56.773 --> 03:39:59.256
about myself with these rolls.

5141
03:40:02.419 --> 03:40:05.980
MATT: Though the opinion of the time you trained

5142
03:40:05.980 --> 03:40:09.740
with the Cobalt Soul seems to largely be

5143
03:40:09.740 --> 03:40:13.530
that of one who fucks off and doesn't pay the mind

5144
03:40:13.530 --> 03:40:15.530
that a devoted monk would,

5145
03:40:17.290 --> 03:40:19.320
people like Dairon

5146
03:40:19.320 --> 03:40:21.270
have seen the

5147
03:40:21.270 --> 03:40:24.370
keen sense for gathering information

5148
03:40:24.370 --> 03:40:27.730
and the utilitarian usage of it.

5149
03:40:29.060 --> 03:40:31.600
Passing through, as this conversation's happening,

5150
03:40:31.600 --> 03:40:34.720
your memory banks, Scourgers, a phrase that

5151
03:40:34.720 --> 03:40:36.870
lingers for a second in your brain.

5152
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:38.620
You think about, could be the rifts,

5153
03:40:38.620 --> 03:40:41.210
could be the rifts, Scourgers, where have I read

5154
03:40:41.210 --> 03:40:42.620
about that, I've read about that.

5155
03:40:45.800 --> 03:40:47.680
Scourgers is a

5156
03:40:49.270 --> 03:40:50.570
colloquial nickname

5157
03:40:50.570 --> 03:40:53.250
for the Royal Assassins

5158
03:40:55.210 --> 03:40:56.818
underneath the Crown.

5159
03:41:01.290 --> 03:41:03.460
The term itself is used like a

5160
03:41:04.730 --> 03:41:07.930
ghost story. People talk about them,

5161
03:41:07.930 --> 03:41:09.710
and in history, there's references,

5162
03:41:10.590 --> 03:41:13.170
but, you know, how much can be proven?

5163
03:41:13.170 --> 03:41:14.290
They do their job well enough

5164
03:41:14.290 --> 03:41:16.040
that they are just a ghost story.

5165
03:41:19.360 --> 03:41:20.193
MARISHA: Is that it?

5166
03:41:21.308 --> 03:41:22.141
Yeah?

5167
03:41:22.141 --> 03:41:23.110
MATT: You got that with a natural 20,

5168
03:41:23.110 --> 03:41:25.500
not a lot of people know about that.

5169
03:41:25.500 --> 03:41:28.360
MARISHA: Sorry, I thought you said scourges?

5170
03:41:28.360 --> 03:41:29.193
LAURA: Yeah.

5171
03:41:29.193 --> 03:41:31.820
MARISHA: But it's Scourgers.
LAURA: Oh.

5172
03:41:31.820 --> 03:41:33.930
MARISHA: Are you sure, was it Scourgers?

5173
03:41:33.930 --> 03:41:37.050
LAURA: It could have been, scourges sounded,

5174
03:41:37.050 --> 03:41:40.030
yeah, it could have been Scourgers, why?

5175
03:41:40.030 --> 03:41:41.253
LIAM: What are they?

5176
03:41:44.060 --> 03:41:46.680
MARISHA: People who are shadows and stories.

5177
03:41:48.180 --> 03:41:51.520
I honestly wasn't sure if they were real or not,

5178
03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:56.000
but also, people don't think that the Expositors are real.

5179
03:41:57.330 --> 03:42:00.710
They're royal assassins, like,

5180
03:42:03.860 --> 03:42:07.370
people that rich people don't want you to know about,

5181
03:42:07.370 --> 03:42:09.110
that they have killing other people,

5182
03:42:09.110 --> 03:42:10.210
that they don't want--

5183
03:42:11.969 --> 03:42:12.802
LIAM: That sounds like--

5184
03:42:12.802 --> 03:42:13.940
MARISHA: Involved.
LAURA: I scried into,

5185
03:42:13.940 --> 03:42:16.210
like, a really secret meeting.

5186
03:42:16.210 --> 03:42:18.200
MATT: Your conversations--
LAURA: That's really good timing.

5187
03:42:18.200 --> 03:42:20.330
MATT: The conversation strikes you as,

5188
03:42:23.410 --> 03:42:25.830
you've only heard the term,

5189
03:42:25.830 --> 03:42:27.580
you've only heard the term once before,

5190
03:42:27.580 --> 03:42:29.350
and it was a long time ago, you didn't make the connection,

5191
03:42:29.350 --> 03:42:33.200
but--
LIAM: But it's me and my friends.

5192
03:42:33.200 --> 03:42:35.790
MATT: Vollstrecker is the title you're more familiar with.

5193
03:42:37.580 --> 03:42:39.040
MARISHA: You were a Scourger?

5194
03:42:41.180 --> 03:42:42.680
LIAM: No.

5195
03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:45.678
MARISHA: They were training you to be a Scourger?

5196
03:42:47.087 --> 03:42:47.920
LIAM: I think so.

5197
03:42:50.347 --> 03:42:52.820
LAURA: You were going to be a shadow, like an assassin?

5198
03:42:55.280 --> 03:42:59.771
LIAM: Yeah, I failed, though, I broke off.

5199
03:42:59.771 --> 03:43:01.171
I broke.

5200
03:43:03.140 --> 03:43:06.550
LAURA: You'll always be an assassin to me.

5201
03:43:08.680 --> 03:43:12.140
SAM: You can be anything you set your mind to, no.

5202
03:43:12.140 --> 03:43:14.900
MARISHA: It's weird for those sentiments right now.

5203
03:43:16.690 --> 03:43:18.670
SAM: These are bad people.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5204
03:43:18.670 --> 03:43:22.280
SAM: These are bad people, we should tell the Bright Queen.

5205
03:43:23.150 --> 03:43:25.290
LIAM: How do we want to help?

5206
03:43:25.290 --> 03:43:26.123
TALIESIN: My, my--

5207
03:43:26.123 --> 03:43:28.760
LIAM: Not the people who messed you up.

5208
03:43:28.760 --> 03:43:31.360
LAURA: If we tell them about this,

5209
03:43:31.360 --> 03:43:34.430
we're for sure taking a side now,

5210
03:43:34.430 --> 03:43:36.770
we are definitely saying we're for Xhorhas.

5211
03:43:36.770 --> 03:43:38.216
TRAVIS: Jester's right.

5212
03:43:38.216 --> 03:43:40.480
TALIESIN: If we say nothing, we're also taking a side.

5213
03:43:41.447 --> 03:43:43.720
LAURA: If we say nothing.

5214
03:43:43.720 --> 03:43:44.553
LIAM: Yeah.

5215
03:43:44.553 --> 03:43:46.230
MARISHA: What if we capture this blonde bastard?

5216
03:43:48.010 --> 03:43:50.380
LAURA: Yeah, but he's in the Empire,

5217
03:43:50.380 --> 03:43:51.430
like, what are we going to do?

5218
03:43:51.430 --> 03:43:53.890
MARISHA: He's apparently going to be here in two days.

5219
03:43:54.830 --> 03:43:56.310
LAURA: Well,

5220
03:43:56.310 --> 03:43:58.175
I mean--
TRAVIS: You said he was taking notes?

5221
03:43:58.175 --> 03:44:00.230
LAURA: He was taking notes, yeah.

5222
03:44:00.230 --> 03:44:01.512
MARISHA: It sounded like a war meeting.

5223
03:44:01.512 --> 03:44:04.750
LIAM: And talking to a liege, you said?

5224
03:44:04.750 --> 03:44:07.820
LAURA: Everybody was saying, "My liege, my liege."

5225
03:44:07.820 --> 03:44:10.170
TRAVIS: I mean, we should do both.

5226
03:44:10.170 --> 03:44:11.778
We should let the Bright Queen

5227
03:44:11.778 --> 03:44:13.980
and the throne know about the attacks,

5228
03:44:13.980 --> 03:44:16.810
and we should set an ambush with help

5229
03:44:16.810 --> 03:44:18.990
for the man with the blonde hair.

5230
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:21.390
LIAM: You were overhearing a conversation with King Dwendal.

5231
03:44:22.380 --> 03:44:23.930
LAURA: Ooh, yeah, probably.

5232
03:44:23.930 --> 03:44:26.310
SAM: My liege is definitely a king, not just,

5233
03:44:26.310 --> 03:44:28.900
like, a high ranking military person?

5234
03:44:28.900 --> 03:44:31.610
TRAVIS: No, my liege is always a king.

5235
03:44:31.610 --> 03:44:33.440
LAURA: Ooh, damn, I was in there with the king!

5236
03:44:33.440 --> 03:44:35.830
SAM: Oh, did you get a look at him?

5237
03:44:35.830 --> 03:44:37.930
LAURA: No, all I could see was this blonde guy.

5238
03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:40.270
MARISHA: Well, the problem--
LAURA: It's weird,

5239
03:44:40.270 --> 03:44:42.040
it's like, it's like--
SAM: I have a doll.

5240
03:44:42.040 --> 03:44:44.980
LAURA: I can see him, and everything around it's like this

5241
03:44:44.980 --> 03:44:46.970
weird fuzziness and stuff, and then, like,

5242
03:44:46.970 --> 03:44:48.550
sometimes I can hear things around them,

5243
03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:51.340
and sometimes there's just muffled-y sounds.

5244
03:44:51.340 --> 03:44:53.985
It's a really, really cool experience,

5245
03:44:53.985 --> 03:44:57.440
I want you guys to be able to do it sometime.

5246
03:44:59.550 --> 03:45:00.600
MARISHA: It sounds like this is

5247
03:45:00.600 --> 03:45:03.740
a pretty highly orchestrated attack,

5248
03:45:06.100 --> 03:45:09.470
it sounds like this is a several point invasion.

5249
03:45:09.470 --> 03:45:11.020
TRAVIS: Coordinated.

5250
03:45:11.020 --> 03:45:15.530
MARISHA: If they're talking about mobilizing three legions,

5251
03:45:15.530 --> 03:45:19.170
bringing in the Ashguard to, or the Righteous Brand

5252
03:45:19.170 --> 03:45:21.700
to guard, moving to the Ashkeep,

5253
03:45:21.700 --> 03:45:25.450
and then sending out the Scourgers--

5254
03:45:25.450 --> 03:45:29.690
LIAM: Dates, did they say dates, times, when, soon?

5255
03:45:29.690 --> 03:45:30.870
MATT: You didn't pick up any of that.

5256
03:45:30.870 --> 03:45:32.890
LAURA: Not that I could hear.

5257
03:45:33.948 --> 03:45:36.320
I only heard them when they raised their voices,

5258
03:45:36.320 --> 03:45:37.540
you know, sometimes

5259
03:45:38.890 --> 03:45:40.360
it was kind of muffled.

5260
03:45:40.360 --> 03:45:43.550
MARISHA: What if this blonde bastard, this is his side

5261
03:45:43.550 --> 03:45:47.070
of the plan? He's here to get deep,

5262
03:45:47.070 --> 03:45:51.130
get beyond the borders, unleash these rifts, I don't know.

5263
03:45:51.130 --> 03:45:52.955
LIAM: Maybe if we find him,

5264
03:45:52.955 --> 03:45:56.346
we can pull the timing out of him,

5265
03:45:56.346 --> 03:46:00.210
and then go to these places--

5266
03:46:00.210 --> 03:46:01.590
TALIESIN: And then what?

5267
03:46:01.590 --> 03:46:05.320
LIAM: And then take hold of some of these Scourgers,

5268
03:46:06.584 --> 03:46:07.860
and use them

5269
03:46:09.160 --> 03:46:11.160
to reach deeper.

5270
03:46:11.160 --> 03:46:13.930
LAURA: Very intricate plan.
TALIESIN: This seems complicated

5271
03:46:13.930 --> 03:46:16.430
TRAVIS: The only timing we have is in two days, right?

5272
03:46:16.430 --> 03:46:17.263
LIAM: Correct.

5273
03:46:17.263 --> 03:46:18.520
TALIESIN: And what happens in two days?

5274
03:46:18.520 --> 03:46:20.060
TRAVIS: Well, we know something happens at the--

5275
03:46:20.060 --> 03:46:21.630
LAURA: Somebody goes--
ASHLEY: Overcrow.

5276
03:46:21.630 --> 03:46:24.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, so we should set an ambush with help,

5277
03:46:24.490 --> 03:46:27.260
we should let the Bright Queen know about the Ashkeeper.

5278
03:46:29.070 --> 03:46:31.890
That's all we have, I mean, we can make a small movement

5279
03:46:31.890 --> 03:46:33.990
against this, but anything larger than that,

5280
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:36.150
I don't think we have time for.

5281
03:46:36.150 --> 03:46:37.580
We can tip the scales slightly,

5282
03:46:37.580 --> 03:46:40.490
we might not even find balance, but it's a something.

5283
03:46:40.490 --> 03:46:43.650
MARISHA: What if this guy, this blonde asshole is there

5284
03:46:43.650 --> 03:46:45.710
to meet with Maruo, what if he's,

5285
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:47.500
what if those crates were meant for him?

5286
03:46:47.500 --> 03:46:50.710
What if she is a mole?

5287
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:52.940
TRAVIS: Yeah, entirely possible, I mean, look.

5288
03:46:52.940 --> 03:46:55.150
We're not, it's not about choosing a side,

5289
03:46:55.150 --> 03:46:56.710
we said in front of the Bright Queen,

5290
03:46:56.710 --> 03:46:58.770
you said yourself that we want to learn more

5291
03:46:58.770 --> 03:47:00.660
about these people. The only way

5292
03:47:00.660 --> 03:47:02.380
that's going to happen is if we can start some kind

5293
03:47:02.380 --> 03:47:05.420
of a dialogue, and as long as there are ambushes

5294
03:47:05.420 --> 03:47:06.990
and secret plans being carried out,

5295
03:47:06.990 --> 03:47:08.480
there is going to be no peace.

5296
03:47:08.480 --> 03:47:12.170
LIAM: Yes, we have similar goals to the queen,

5297
03:47:12.170 --> 03:47:15.770
but not the same, but perhaps if we work together to

5298
03:47:18.090 --> 03:47:21.110
execute a sting, you know, and get these people,

5299
03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:24.090
perhaps the queen will want one thing,

5300
03:47:24.090 --> 03:47:25.560
and our intentions are another.

5301
03:47:25.560 --> 03:47:27.590
But she does not have to know that.

5302
03:47:27.590 --> 03:47:28.681
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5303
03:47:28.681 --> 03:47:32.650
MARISHA: We also have no proof of this conversation,

5304
03:47:32.650 --> 03:47:34.050
we just heard it.
LIAM: No, but

5305
03:47:35.540 --> 03:47:39.610
this moment happening, and us getting this bastard

5306
03:47:40.870 --> 03:47:42.170
would supply that proof.

5307
03:47:42.170 --> 03:47:44.770
LAURA: Maybe somebody was scrying on us right

5308
03:47:44.770 --> 03:47:47.400
when I was scrying on him, and they already know.

5309
03:47:47.400 --> 03:47:48.760
TRAVIS: They might.
LIAM: Maybe.

5310
03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:50.750
TRAVIS: And they wouldn't have to wait long to find out,

5311
03:47:50.750 --> 03:47:52.416
it's two days.

5312
03:47:53.532 --> 03:47:54.840
I mean, shit, if we're wrong, they can lock us up,

5313
03:47:54.840 --> 03:47:57.050
but something's going to happen one way or the other.

5314
03:47:57.050 --> 03:47:58.620
SAM: Well, let's go tell, let's go tell.

5315
03:47:58.620 --> 03:48:00.060
LIAM: Yes, and from

5316
03:48:01.850 --> 03:48:05.350
the queen's perspective, we are just turncoats, yeah?

5317
03:48:05.350 --> 03:48:08.202
We are helping them against the Empire,

5318
03:48:08.202 --> 03:48:10.240
but what we are really doing, we really need

5319
03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:12.110
to find your contact.

5320
03:48:12.110 --> 03:48:15.300
LAURA: Hey, you guys, just so you know,

5321
03:48:15.300 --> 03:48:19.950
there are spells that can make you tell the truth, so.

5322
03:48:21.130 --> 03:48:24.572
You know, if it seems at all

5323
03:48:24.572 --> 03:48:29.030
like there are things you don't want her to know,

5324
03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:32.273
just be careful, okay?
TRAVIS: Sure.

5325
03:48:33.360 --> 03:48:36.510
TALIESIN: I think what Miss Jester's trying to say,

5326
03:48:36.510 --> 03:48:37.680
Mr. Caleb, is

5327
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:43.470
I understand your impulses to

5328
03:48:43.470 --> 03:48:45.520
get on top of this, but

5329
03:48:46.530 --> 03:48:49.730
some things are too big to get on top of.

5330
03:48:49.730 --> 03:48:51.370
Some,

5331
03:48:51.370 --> 03:48:55.240
some things are just bigger than us.

5332
03:48:56.290 --> 03:48:57.123
And

5333
03:48:58.140 --> 03:49:02.050
any attempt to wrangle or get them to submit

5334
03:49:02.050 --> 03:49:03.540
to our will is just,

5335
03:49:05.120 --> 03:49:06.660
what was the old saying,

5336
03:49:08.710 --> 03:49:10.230
whipping the tide for daring

5337
03:49:10.230 --> 03:49:13.760
to turn without one's leave, maybe--

5338
03:49:13.760 --> 03:49:15.310
MARISHA: Do people say that?

5339
03:49:15.310 --> 03:49:16.230
LAURA: I didn't know that--

5340
03:49:16.230 --> 03:49:18.120
Honestly, that's way more in depth than

5341
03:49:18.120 --> 03:49:18.953
what I was going for.

5342
03:49:18.953 --> 03:49:21.240
SAM: I think she was just saying, like--

5343
03:49:21.240 --> 03:49:22.730
LAURA: Just so you know, there's a spell

5344
03:49:22.730 --> 03:49:24.397
called Zone of Truth, and she could use it.

5345
03:49:24.397 --> 03:49:26.840
TALIESIN: The point I'm making is maybe instead

5346
03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:31.840
of trying to control the situation, which is beyond me,

5347
03:49:32.540 --> 03:49:35.380
maybe we just try and do whatever good is right

5348
03:49:35.380 --> 03:49:37.300
in front of us.

5349
03:49:37.300 --> 03:49:38.950
LIAM: We are talking about the same thing,

5350
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:41.420
and I do not need to tell any lies.

5351
03:49:41.420 --> 03:49:44.370
I will say the same things I have said in her chambers.

5352
03:49:44.370 --> 03:49:45.560
We are going

5353
03:49:45.560 --> 03:49:48.630
to rip the Cerberus Assembly

5354
03:49:49.560 --> 03:49:50.890
down.

5355
03:49:50.890 --> 03:49:52.360
MARISHA: We don't need to control the situation,

5356
03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:54.000
we just need to shine light on it.

5357
03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:57.590
LIAM: That's what she wants, and that's what we want.

5358
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:59.850
TRAVIS: He's right, we're talking about the same thing.

5359
03:49:59.850 --> 03:50:02.720
SAM: How do we get in touch with her?

5360
03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:03.830
LAURA: How do we get what?

5361
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:06.360
SAM: Essek, are you listening to this conversation?

5362
03:50:08.696 --> 03:50:09.954
No.

5363
03:50:09.954 --> 03:50:11.220
LAURA: We should probably just go.

5364
03:50:11.220 --> 03:50:13.010
SAM: Sometimes, I--
LAURA: We should probably go?

5365
03:50:13.010 --> 03:50:14.430
SAM: Just go knock?

5366
03:50:14.430 --> 03:50:15.900
LAURA: To the, to the, yeah.

5367
03:50:15.900 --> 03:50:17.666
TRAVIS: In the morning, maybe,

5368
03:50:17.666 --> 03:50:20.820
so it's not in the dead of night?

5369
03:50:20.820 --> 03:50:22.610
SAM: Okay, yep, sure.

5370
03:50:22.610 --> 03:50:23.443
MARISHA: I don't know.

5371
03:50:23.443 --> 03:50:24.690
LAURA: It seems pretty important.

5372
03:50:24.690 --> 03:50:26.740
TALIESIN: I feel like I would want to know.

5373
03:50:26.740 --> 03:50:29.080
MARISHA: I don't know if these people sleep, right?

5374
03:50:29.080 --> 03:50:30.010
It's just kind of--

5375
03:50:30.010 --> 03:50:31.934
LAURA: They go to sleep, everyone sleeps.

5376
03:50:33.608 --> 03:50:36.293
TALIESIN: I think we should just go.

5377
03:50:36.293 --> 03:50:38.550
ASHLEY: I think we should just go, too, because

5378
03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:41.960
that's an extra day that would give them to plan.

5379
03:50:41.960 --> 03:50:44.120
TALIESIN: Time to think.
ASHLEY: Time to think.

5380
03:50:44.120 --> 03:50:46.140
LIAM: And the angle here is that we are suggesting

5381
03:50:46.140 --> 03:50:48.930
that they use us as the traitors we are.

5382
03:50:50.880 --> 03:50:52.670
TALIESIN: I don't understand that, but.

5383
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:53.820
LAURA: The angle here is.

5384
03:50:57.760 --> 03:51:00.001
LIAM: We tell them what we know,

5385
03:51:00.001 --> 03:51:02.284
we suggest they use as insiders

5386
03:51:02.284 --> 03:51:05.750
to the Empire, and we stay connected

5387
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:07.933
to it the whole way through.

5388
03:51:09.100 --> 03:51:11.270
LAURA: I understand now.

5389
03:51:11.270 --> 03:51:13.320
I'm not from the Empire.
TALIESIN: Neither am I.

5390
03:51:15.331 --> 03:51:16.881
LIAM: You're friends to the Empire.

5391
03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:20.824
LAURA: Friends to everyone, really.

5392
03:51:20.824 --> 03:51:21.810
TALIESIN: I'd agree with that.

5393
03:51:21.810 --> 03:51:22.840
TRAVIS: Maybe they'll give us something

5394
03:51:22.840 --> 03:51:24.380
to help amplify our efforts.

5395
03:51:25.560 --> 03:51:27.370
SAM: That'd be nice.

5396
03:51:27.370 --> 03:51:28.203
Let's go.

5397
03:51:28.203 --> 03:51:30.337
TALIESIN: I see your reasoning, though.

5398
03:51:31.430 --> 03:51:33.521
SAM: To the moorbounders!

5399
03:51:33.521 --> 03:51:35.806
TRAVIS: Or we could just walk.
SAM: Or we could just walk.

5400
03:51:35.806 --> 03:51:37.022
We'll just walk.

5401
03:51:37.022 --> 03:51:38.205
TALIESIN: Is there a bus, maybe?

5402
03:51:39.557 --> 03:51:40.390
ASHLEY: Trolley.

5403
03:51:40.390 --> 03:51:42.490
MATT: All right, so what is now early evening,

5404
03:51:44.280 --> 03:51:48.100
roughly, I mean, a day, tomorrow is the day

5405
03:51:48.100 --> 03:51:51.510
that was chosen for this meeting, whatever it is.

5406
03:51:52.450 --> 03:51:55.010
You are currently gathering your things,

5407
03:51:55.010 --> 03:51:58.713
and heading towards the center of the city.

5408
03:52:00.040 --> 03:52:02.850
Okay, so as you walk towards Lucid Bastion,

5409
03:52:04.490 --> 03:52:06.850
your hearts in your throat,

5410
03:52:08.090 --> 03:52:11.500
preparing for whatever choice you're about to make,

5411
03:52:11.500 --> 03:52:13.500
discussing that as you're making your way.

5412
03:52:13.500 --> 03:52:15.041
MARISHA: Yeah, discuss as--

5413
03:52:15.041 --> 03:52:16.891
Can I pull Fjord back a little bit,

5414
03:52:16.891 --> 03:52:18.470
and just trail behind the others for a minute?

5415
03:52:18.470 --> 03:52:20.376
MATT: Sure.
MARISHA: Can I talk to you?

5416
03:52:20.376 --> 03:52:22.751
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5417
03:52:22.751 --> 03:52:24.220
MARISHA: I am a bit

5418
03:52:25.490 --> 03:52:26.650
in a conflict

5419
03:52:28.420 --> 03:52:29.850
in my brain.

5420
03:52:32.771 --> 03:52:34.490
Having, I don't know what to do.

5421
03:52:35.380 --> 03:52:36.213
TRAVIS: About?

5422
03:52:37.650 --> 03:52:41.630
MARISHA: You remember Dairon, my trainer, my master?

5423
03:52:41.630 --> 03:52:42.463
TRAVIS: Sure.

5424
03:52:45.280 --> 03:52:48.125
MARISHA: I should probably reach out to her, right?

5425
03:52:49.190 --> 03:52:52.050
TRAVIS: Oh, about this?

5426
03:52:53.850 --> 03:52:55.600
Could you do that if you wanted to?

5427
03:52:57.720 --> 03:52:59.860
MARISHA: I could have Jester send a message.

5428
03:53:04.340 --> 03:53:07.770
TRAVIS: Well, in these situations, there are pros and cons.

5429
03:53:07.770 --> 03:53:09.220
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: What are the pros?

5430
03:53:11.460 --> 03:53:15.860
MARISHA: The pros are that I reunite with someone who cares

5431
03:53:15.860 --> 03:53:17.700
about my wellbeing, and

5432
03:53:19.380 --> 03:53:20.950
might be a potential ally.

5433
03:53:22.850 --> 03:53:24.750
TRAVIS: Cons?

5434
03:53:25.680 --> 03:53:27.263
MARISHA: She's more connected to the Empire

5435
03:53:27.263 --> 03:53:29.146
than I even knew,

5436
03:53:30.220 --> 03:53:34.840
and any information or exchange or meeting could result

5437
03:53:36.570 --> 03:53:40.270
in the demise of either one of us?

5438
03:53:42.979 --> 03:53:46.627
TRAVIS: I admit, I had not thought about that at all.

5439
03:53:47.575 --> 03:53:49.590
MARISHA: I don't know who I'm trying to protect more,

5440
03:53:49.590 --> 03:53:51.107
myself or her.

5441
03:53:53.400 --> 03:53:55.020
Or maybe I just have this crazy thought,

5442
03:53:55.020 --> 03:53:57.510
that if we go off and we do something heroic,

5443
03:53:57.510 --> 03:53:59.080
and I save

5444
03:53:59.080 --> 03:54:03.200
the Empire, and become a war hero, then

5445
03:54:05.200 --> 03:54:07.470
no one has to be assassinated.

5446
03:54:07.470 --> 03:54:10.818
MARISHA: Real question: Do you care about the Empire?

5447
03:54:11.790 --> 03:54:13.115
No judgment.

5448
03:54:16.236 --> 03:54:18.336
MARISHA: I didn't think I did.

5449
03:54:20.360 --> 03:54:22.777
It's not the Empire that I care about.

5450
03:54:24.340 --> 03:54:27.040
I just think the more and more that I'm on the ground,

5451
03:54:28.010 --> 03:54:28.843
and I'm

5452
03:54:30.280 --> 03:54:32.390
walking, and I'm seeing the faces

5453
03:54:34.020 --> 03:54:36.980
of people from city to city,

5454
03:54:39.330 --> 03:54:41.472
and everyone's the fucking same.

5455
03:54:42.670 --> 03:54:44.470
I mean, sure, people look different,

5456
03:54:46.570 --> 03:54:48.770
have different customs and beliefs, but

5457
03:54:51.430 --> 03:54:53.890
everyone's miserable, everyone's just trying to survive,

5458
03:54:53.890 --> 03:54:57.150
everyone's just trying to fucking make a living,

5459
03:54:57.150 --> 03:55:00.670
and raise a family.

5460
03:55:00.670 --> 03:55:02.570
TRAVIS: Dairon always give you a fair shake?

5461
03:55:06.280 --> 03:55:07.780
MARISHA: Yeah.

5462
03:55:07.780 --> 03:55:08.613
But

5463
03:55:09.962 --> 03:55:11.710
at this point in time, I've spent more time

5464
03:55:11.710 --> 03:55:13.352
with you all than her.

5465
03:55:15.140 --> 03:55:19.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, but some of these things come around.

5466
03:55:19.450 --> 03:55:21.980
You got to send them back the other way.

5467
03:55:21.980 --> 03:55:24.770
She's been fair to you, you deserve,

5468
03:55:24.770 --> 03:55:27.613
she deserves to get a fair shake from you.

5469
03:55:28.860 --> 03:55:30.240
It doesn't mean you need to send these things

5470
03:55:30.240 --> 03:55:31.963
in opposition, but

5471
03:55:33.560 --> 03:55:34.393
I think if you don't give

5472
03:55:34.393 --> 03:55:36.680
her a head's up, you'll be fucked up about it.

5473
03:55:37.570 --> 03:55:39.920
She's a big girl, she can take care of herself.

5474
03:55:42.798 --> 03:55:43.798
MARISHA: All right.

5475
03:55:44.900 --> 03:55:46.930
I should probably tell her before

5476
03:55:46.930 --> 03:55:49.270
tomorrow night, do you think?

5477
03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:52.740
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Maybe she could help us.

5478
03:55:56.230 --> 03:55:58.520
Or she'll slit my throat for being a traitor,

5479
03:55:58.520 --> 03:56:03.360
but I guess we'll find out! A lot can happen in 24 hours.

5480
03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:05.620
TRAVIS: Guarantee you she will if you don't tell her.

5481
03:56:05.620 --> 03:56:07.787
MARISHA: Yeah, you're not wrong.

5482
03:56:10.100 --> 03:56:12.443
All right, let's see how this works, I guess.

5483
03:56:14.200 --> 03:56:15.800
MATT: As you rejoin the group,

5484
03:56:15.800 --> 03:56:20.130
heading towards the climbing stone spires of Lucid Bastion

5485
03:56:20.130 --> 03:56:25.112
in the center of the Kryn Dynasty capital of Rosohna,

5486
03:56:26.580 --> 03:56:30.710
we'll end tonight's episode there. We'll pick up next week.

5487
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:32.800
TALIESIN: Time to figure your shit out.

5488
03:56:32.800 --> 03:56:34.674
MATT: I've got plenty to figure out, Jesus.

5489
03:56:34.674 --> 03:56:36.980
(laughter)

5490
03:56:36.980 --> 03:56:38.370
LAURA: Jeez louise.

5491
03:56:38.370 --> 03:56:42.010
TRAVIS: I'm tracking one, no, make that three, five bogies,

5492
03:56:42.010 --> 03:56:45.482
I got nine bogies.
(laughter)

5493
03:56:45.482 --> 03:56:47.540
MATT: Ah, information's useful.

5494
03:56:47.540 --> 03:56:49.240
Information can also be dangerous.

5495
03:56:50.460 --> 03:56:52.080
SAM: Man.
MATT: Oh, man.

5496
03:56:52.080 --> 03:56:54.960
SAM: Intrigue everywhere.
MARISHA: Espionage.

5497
03:56:54.960 --> 03:56:58.193
SAM: There's stuff happening all across the continent.

5498
03:56:59.340 --> 03:57:01.815
TALIESIN: Gardening.
MARISHA: Fabulous wallpaper.

5499
03:57:01.815 --> 03:57:04.020
(laughter)

5500
03:57:04.020 --> 03:57:06.760
MATT: Shit, all right, well, we'll pick up there next week,

5501
03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:08.810
as you guys step into the Lucid Bastion

5502
03:57:08.810 --> 03:57:12.340
for whatever plan you have hatched.

5503
03:57:12.340 --> 03:57:14.210
Thank you, Deven Rue, for the amazing map

5504
03:57:14.210 --> 03:57:16.210
as you continue to make for the campaign.

5505
03:57:16.210 --> 03:57:17.510
It's so good.
LAURA: Phenomenal.

5506
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:18.343
MATT: She's so good.

5507
03:57:18.343 --> 03:57:19.176
TRAVIS: Fuck, it's so dope, I don't--

5508
03:57:19.176 --> 03:57:21.192
TALIESIN: It's so--
ASHLEY: So cool.

5509
03:57:21.192 --> 03:57:23.350
TRAVIS: What blood that creature that came from,

5510
03:57:23.350 --> 03:57:26.056
but damn.

5511
03:57:26.056 --> 03:57:27.173
TALIESIN: Eventually, we're going to have to have a

5512
03:57:27.173 --> 03:57:29.240
conversation about this, this thing is a--

5513
03:57:29.240 --> 03:57:30.610
TRAVIS: What's that?
ASHLEY: It's something.

5514
03:57:30.610 --> 03:57:31.669
MARISHA: Is that your staff?

5515
03:57:31.669 --> 03:57:32.810
TALIESIN: No, this is my

5516
03:57:32.810 --> 03:57:35.450
little metal albatross that I've been carrying,

5517
03:57:35.450 --> 03:57:37.370
that we have to recombine, this fucking sword.

5518
03:57:37.370 --> 03:57:38.460
ASHLEY: That sword?

5519
03:57:38.460 --> 03:57:39.300
SAM: You know what it is?

5520
03:57:39.300 --> 03:57:40.510
TALIESIN: No, I have no idea, it could be--

5521
03:57:40.510 --> 03:57:41.740
LAURA: We got to figure it out.

5522
03:57:41.740 --> 03:57:43.600
TALIESIN: It could be cursed, it could be great,

5523
03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:44.833
I have no idea.

5524
03:57:44.833 --> 03:57:45.749
TRAVIS: Either way, it's a win.

5525
03:57:45.749 --> 03:57:47.410
TALIESIN: Either way, it's interesting.

5526
03:57:47.410 --> 03:57:48.480
MATT: All righty, well--

5527
03:57:48.480 --> 03:57:49.896
TALIESIN: Here, thank you.

5528
03:57:49.896 --> 03:57:51.131
MARISHA: Vollstrecker?

5529
03:57:51.131 --> 03:57:53.206
TRAVIS: What did you give him? What was that?

5530
03:57:53.206 --> 03:57:54.820
MATT: It's the feather token that he used to make the tree,

5531
03:57:54.820 --> 03:57:56.813
it's gone now.
LIAM: One and done?

5532
03:57:56.813 --> 03:57:57.646
MATT: One and done.

5533
03:57:57.646 --> 03:57:58.479
TRAVIS: Well used.

5534
03:57:58.479 --> 03:58:01.340
MATT: Well used.

5535
03:58:01.340 --> 03:58:04.350
TALIESIN: I feel, and the garden, when we get up there,

5536
03:58:04.350 --> 03:58:05.490
and there's a proper description,

5537
03:58:05.490 --> 03:58:07.990
there's some dope shit up there, it's going to be great.

5538
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:09.180
MATT: I'm excited.

5539
03:58:09.180 --> 03:58:10.690
TALIESIN: I did some good shit up there.

5540
03:58:10.690 --> 03:58:13.170
Stone Shape's a great, great spell.

5541
03:58:13.170 --> 03:58:16.640
MATT: Well, folks, we're going to get to our shit.

5542
03:58:17.573 --> 03:58:19.078
We have an hour till it's Marisha's birthday,

5543
03:58:19.078 --> 03:58:20.974
so swarm her on Twitter when it gets there.

5544
03:58:20.974 --> 03:58:22.501
LAURA: Yeah!

5545
03:58:22.501 --> 03:58:25.800
MARISHA: You're such a husband.
(laughter)

5546
03:58:25.800 --> 03:58:28.679
MATT: Legally, metaphorically, and spiritually, I am.

5547
03:58:28.679 --> 03:58:30.129
LIAM: Check and mate.

5548
03:58:30.129 --> 03:58:34.223
MATT: I know, guilty as charged.

5549
03:58:34.223 --> 03:58:36.260
Well, guys, have a wonderful night,

5550
03:58:36.260 --> 03:58:38.120
we'll see you next week, we love you very much,

5551
03:58:38.120 --> 03:58:40.410
and is it Thursday yet?

5552
03:58:40.410 --> 03:58:42.646
Good night.

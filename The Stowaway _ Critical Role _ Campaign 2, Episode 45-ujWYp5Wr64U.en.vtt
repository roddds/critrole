00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.216
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.216 --> 00:00:05.696
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:08.005
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.069
LIAM: We should just get a sound cue for that at
this point.

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:12.886
TRAVIS: It's expected now.

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:16.020
MATT: It's like our version of (air horn).

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.205
LIAM: (like an air horn) Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:22.127
MATT: Before we get started, we have some
announcements to get to. First and foremost, we

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:27.206
have two fantastic sponsors tonight: our fantastic
friends from D&amp;D Beyond return. Sam?

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:33.578
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, what a year of sponsorship from
D&amp;D Beyond! They've been with us all campaign

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:41.559
long, all year long, and to thank them for such a
wonderful 2018, I thought I would give them a

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:51.813
gift, an ad that will hopefully live on forever.
I'm calling it My Christmas Gif. You heard that

00:00:51.813 --> 00:00:56.097
right. It's not a Christmas gift, it's a Christmas
GIF.

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.691
TRAVIS: How do you make the letter F with your
hands?

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.874
SAM: GIF.

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:00.020
TRAVIS: Nope!

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.707
SAM: These are two Cs. Or "Jiff" if you want to
say it wrong. Here's how it's going to work: I

00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:14.052
don't know how to make a GIF or a "Jiff," but you
fine Critters out there do. So what I'm going to

00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:20.281
do is do some movements, some reactions, some
acting, and hopefully be joined by some fellow

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:24.828
cast members. The crew's going to bring out a
green screen and we're going to do this over there

00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:31.134
at this camera. You guys will be encouraged to add
your own backgrounds to make this something

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:36.209
memorable that can live online so that when you're
going through the Twitters or the Reddits or the

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.384
"Im-i-gurrs", I don't know what that is,
"Im-gurr"?

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:40.678
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Imgur.

00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:49.081
SAM: Thank you. I'm an old man! When you're going
through the Giphys, maybe you'll come across one

00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:55.930
of these bad boys that we're going to create live,
right now, and then send some love to D&amp;D Beyond.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.377
I'll act one out. I'm going to go over here to
this camera, Matt, if you'll excuse me for one second--

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:03.391
MATT: Okay.

00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.351
MARISHA: We're really doing this?

00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:07.231
SAM: Okay, we're making some GIFs, right here.

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.523
MARISHA: I can't believe you guys are doing this
for him. Max!

00:02:10.523 --> 00:02:18.142
SAM: Okay. We're making GIFs. You guys will turn
this into a GIF later that will live on forever.

00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:23.785
There's lots of GIFs to choose from. I'm going to
do one. You know the guy who blinks who is like,

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:30.833
"Hmm, that's weird?" I'm going to do that. Okay,
ready? And action. (humming) Okay! Someone will

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:40.184
make that into a GIF! Taliesin, do you want to
make one?

00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:41.940
TALIESIN: Oh god, not really.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.477
SAM: I'll direct you.

00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:45.820
TALIESIN: Okay. No. How are you doing this?

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.760
SAM: Here, I'll hold this so you can just act.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.046
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:53.683
SAM: There's a lot of applause GIFs out there, so
why don't you do an applause or a praising type

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:55.671
GIF? Ready? And action!

00:02:55.671 --> 00:03:00.089
TALIESIN: Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:05.513
SAM: Okay, that was so good. Laura, come on. This
is going great, guys!

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:13.818
There's a lot of fail GIFs, right? There's
fail GIFs everywhere, right? So why don't we do

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:22.020
one where you're rolling a dice and oh, it sucked,
or something like that, I don't know. Let's see that.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.503
(groaning)

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:28.510
SAM: That was good. I think we need a take-two.
You've got to get your hand up here.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.675
LAURA: That was--

00:03:30.675 --> 00:03:39.466
SAM: Damn it, didn't work. Matt, do you want to
come do one? No, these are all innocent GIFs. You

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:44.235
know how sometimes on Twitter you see a GIF where
it's like this. Like, "What that commenter said,

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:52.724
"I agree." Just do that, just point up and be like
"Yeah!" Yeah! Right? Yeah! That's a GIF right

00:03:52.724 --> 00:04:01.703
there! We just made a GIF! Last but not least,
I'll do one, I'll do a success one where a d20

00:04:01.703 --> 00:04:07.475
comes rolling in and knocks me out of the frame or
something, I don't know, we'll figure it out later!

00:04:07.475 --> 00:04:10.135
TRAVIS: What about dramatic prairie dog?

00:04:10.135 --> 00:04:12.175
SAM: Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

00:04:12.175 --> 00:04:16.854
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: ♫ Bum bum bum! ♫

00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:20.695
SAM: That's it! That's a wrap! Thanks, guys!

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:23.913
(applause)

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:27.011
TALIESIN: Well done. Good call, Travis.

00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:28.169
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.090
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.607
SAM: That worked so well.

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:37.724
MATT: And thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for being our
fantastic partner through this campaign. Speaking

00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:43.203
of partners, we have a partner sponsor tonight as
well, our returning friends from Rook &amp; Raven.

00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:48.201
They've been with us before, they return tonight.
Creators of the handcrafted, high-quality,

00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:53.254
disc-bound notebooks that you've seen for your
campaign notes, your character notes. They design

00:04:53.254 --> 00:04:55.928
them for all sorts of role-playing games. There
you go with the Mischief and Misadventure one

00:04:55.928 --> 00:05:01.222
there. The work is fantastic. For the month of
December, The Rook &amp; The Raven is donating 100% of

00:05:01.222 --> 00:05:06.289
their profits to schools, teachers, and community
centers to help grow gaming clubs and classes

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.421
through their Adventure Club Gaming Kits. They're
going to be putting everything together and making

00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:17.757
sure that these schools and the facilities have
the necessary materials to help facilitate gaming

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.566
clubs and getting these kids together to build the
strong bonds that I did as a kid, and I'm glad to

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:26.482
see that expanding and they're making that happen.
Go ahead and give the gift of gaming now by

00:05:26.482 --> 00:05:30.044
helping support their work and thus, support these
kids as well at

00:05:30.044 --> 00:05:33.534
TheRookAndTheRaven.com/CriticalRole.

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:39.416
TRAVIS: Nice! That's so cool.

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:43.302
MATT: I think it's badass. I love that that is a
thing that can happen now. I get messages from a

00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.791
lot of people saying they have gaming clubs at
their schools and now there's too many kids

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:55.682
playing and like-- that's so-- yay. That's such a
surreal reality; I'm so happy about that. We also

00:05:55.682 --> 00:06:02.464
have some other big announcements this week that
we put up. First off, we have a fantastic art show

00:06:02.464 --> 00:06:07.028
coming up soon. You guys had a chance to see the
art book, the Vox Machina final campaign art book,

00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:11.001
now we get to announce that we have our very first
art show to celebrate the fantastic art community

00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:16.383
that's come out of Critical Role. Each piece of
art was created by community artists, curated by

00:06:16.383 --> 00:06:22.096
us. Tickets for the opening reception will be
available this coming Monday, December 17th, and

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:25.078
are completely free, and that's just for the
reception. You don't need tickets for the two

00:06:25.078 --> 00:06:30.098
other days. The exhibit will be open through
January 20th. You can stop over at any point in

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:35.562
the weekend if you missed the actual reception
event. It's going to be there. It's going to be at

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:41.160
Gallery Nucleus. You can find out all the
information for that at CritRole.com. We also

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.753
announced that on Saturday, January 19th, that
same weekend, we are doing a return to Vox Machina

00:06:47.753 --> 00:06:50.152
one-shot, our first campaign.

00:06:50.152 --> 00:06:52.905
LAURA: I'm so excited!

00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:59.282
MATT: It's going to be the Search for Grog. For
those, no spoilers, but towards the very end of

00:06:59.282 --> 00:07:06.857
the campaign, something happened, one of our
players pulled a thing from a deck of

00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:14.568
thingy-things and briefly derailed a lot of
things, and we just glossed over it. We're

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:21.254
actually going to play through that adventure as a
one-shot with all the returning members of Vox

00:07:21.254 --> 00:07:26.399
Machina but two, because Grog is being sought
after and another character will not be present.

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:28.576
TRAVIS: (as Grog) I couldn't help it, I'm sorry!

00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:30.649
MATT: We could make it, you know--

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:33.204
LIAM: Well, Travis, some might say that you were
forward thinking.

00:07:33.204 --> 00:07:33.871
TRAVIS: Ooh!

00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:40.008
MATT: Super excited about this one-shot and to
bring us back into the world of Vox Machina. VIP

00:07:40.008 --> 00:07:44.326
tickets go on sale this Saturday, December 15th,
and general admission which goes on sale on

00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:50.494
Sunday, December 16th. VIP attendees will have a
special swag bag, including a signed Vox Machina

00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:56.046
print by the whole cast, as well as a special Q&amp;A
with Brian before the show. It's got a lot of fun

00:07:56.046 --> 00:07:59.731
stuff. Once again, go to CritRole.com for all the
info. We look forward to seeing you guys there.

00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:01.492
(cheering)

00:08:01.492 --> 00:08:03.234
TALIESIN: Hosted by Brian Wayne Foster.

00:08:03.234 --> 00:08:07.194
MATT: Yes. Also, be sure to join us next week for
our very special holiday one-shot, that is being

00:08:07.194 --> 00:08:09.503
DMed by our fantastic Liam O'Brien.

00:08:09.503 --> 00:08:14.206
LIAM: Ha! Ha! Oh my gosh! I'm so excited! I've had
this idea in my head for two years!

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:15.516
TRAVIS: You have, that's right!

00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:20.431
LIAM: Two years! I wanted to do it last Christmas!
I'm mostly ready. We'll see what happens.

00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:25.054
MATT: I was not expecting that much exuberance out
of you. I am twice as pumped now for this, just

00:08:25.054 --> 00:08:27.611
from that. That was adorable!

00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:31.012
LIAM: It's going to be fun! It's going to be so
much fun!

00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:37.039
MATT: It's called The Night Before Critmas. It'll
air on Friday, December 21st at 7:00pm, so Friday

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:45.013
next week, to kick off the holidays right. 7:00pm
Pacific at twitch.tv/criticalrole. Last but not

00:08:45.013 --> 00:08:50.699
least, we also have our very special end of the
year State of the Role tomorrow, which will give

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:55.525
you more insight into our holiday programming
schedule, a few fun things that we have coming in

00:08:55.525 --> 00:09:00.393
2019. You can check out all the details tomorrow
morning at CritRole.com and probably posted across

00:09:00.393 --> 00:09:05.230
our socials, so keep an eye out for that. I think
that's it?

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.447
TRAVIS: Yeah, four pages of notes, I think you got
it.

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:13.630
MATT: Yeah, it was a hefty one, it was a big one.
On that note, my friends, let's go ahead and dive

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:19.733
into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:26.423
(no audio)

00:09:26.423 --> 00:09:29.863
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:43.105
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:09:43.105 --> 00:09:51.797
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:09:51.797 --> 00:09:58.854
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:09:58.854 --> 00:10:02.960
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.610
(music)

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.702
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:20.461
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:24.391
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:32.249
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:37.737
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:47.256
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:10:47.256 --> 00:10:55.769
[fire burning]

00:10:55.769 --> 00:11:06.833
MATT: Welcome back. That was adorable, Laura. Last
we left off: The Mighty Nein, after spending an

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:12.987
exorbitant period of time at sea at the behest of
Captain Avantika, on the ship the Squalleater, got

00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:18.728
pulled into piracy under the banner of The
Revelry, brought to the pirate city and island of

00:11:18.728 --> 00:11:25.802
Darktow amongst the Dragshallow Reefs. There, you
uncovered information, proof that she had plans to

00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:30.671
overthrow the Plank King and rule the seas, along
with her fanatical obsession with Uk'otoa.

00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:32.034
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa!

00:11:32.034 --> 00:11:39.198
MATT: I knew it was coming. You manage to dodge
through the night, grab the necessary journal,

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:44.955
uncover the information through the cipher, and
through a scuffle, survive this fiery battle on

00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:50.964
the docks from the ship. Through some tactical use
of spells and quick members of your party, you got

00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:56.712
it in the hands of the Plank King. Judgement was
brought between the two of you at the dock, and he

00:11:56.712 --> 00:12:08.592
chose Avantika to go. Upon having her make her
leave, violently, gave you guys your reward, which

00:12:08.592 --> 00:12:13.212
was sparing your lives and telling you to get the
fuck out of Darktow and never come back. You were

00:12:13.212 --> 00:12:20.800
gifted the hobbled, burned form of the Squalleater
and left to make your way out towards the ocean

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:29.500
where you attempted to search into the backstory
of Fjord's relationship with his patron, in search

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:36.212
of one of what seems to be the third and final
sphere. You made your way down into the wreckage

00:12:36.212 --> 00:12:41.386
of his ship, The Tide's Breath, and discovered it
was one of many in what was called the Diver's

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:47.602
Grave, a ship graveyard here in the center of the
Lucidian Ocean. In trying to find out where this

00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:55.218
orb went, you were drawn into the underwater lair
of Dashilla the Dreadful. You encountered spirits

00:12:55.218 --> 00:13:02.415
of long-dead sailors bound there by her magic. You
discovered the essence of how she's able to

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:10.470
maintain this graveyard and draw ships down below.
While she managed to flee before being killed, you

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.712
grabbed what you were looking for, fled to the
surface, and with your ship, escaped the growing

00:13:14.712 --> 00:13:23.862
storm before any more danger was brought to you.
That was where we left off. Mighty Nein, as you've

00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:30.052
all gathered your things, you can hear the distant
crack of thunder as the storm gets smaller behind

00:13:30.052 --> 00:13:34.144
you on the horizon. What do you want to do?

00:13:34.144 --> 00:13:42.164
TRAVIS: Should we go back down and just push the
button, just make sure that we're wiped out once

00:13:42.411 --> 00:13:50.179
and for all? I'm kidding. We should make our way
over to the Bisaft Isle, right? Need repairs?

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:51.482
SAM: Yes.

00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:52.847
TRAVIS: That would be the thing to do.

00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:55.591
LAURA: We are pretty hurt here.

00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:59.523
TRAVIS: Yeah, how's everybody feeling, by the
way? Are we damaged, beat up? We all right?

00:13:59.523 --> 00:14:02.217
LAURA: Nothing that a good night's rest won't
help.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.198
TALIESIN: Or two... three.

00:14:04.198 --> 00:14:06.997
SAM: How many days will it be sailing?

00:14:06.997 --> 00:14:09.466
TRAVIS: I'd estimate probably three or four.

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:11.188
MATT: Three or four days from where you are now.

00:14:11.188 --> 00:14:13.078
SAM: You got it right!

00:14:13.078 --> 00:14:20.242
TRAVIS: Believe! You hear that? Holy shit, I got
it right! As I was saying. Orly, if you would,

00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:22.641
please plot us a course to the Bisaft Isle.

00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:30.564
MATT: "Of course, don't you worry." He goes ahead
and sets course. The ship makes its turn across

00:14:30.564 --> 00:14:34.576
the water in the direction of the Bisaft Isle.

00:14:34.576 --> 00:14:36.826
MARISHA: Bishaft?

00:14:36.826 --> 00:14:38.020
TRAVIS: Bisaft.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.130
SAM: (singing) Bishaft, ah!

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.354
TRAVIS: No H, it's Bisaft!

00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:44.254
MARISHA: It's made of fucking cookies.

00:14:44.254 --> 00:14:45.235
MATT: Bisaft.

00:14:45.235 --> 00:14:47.196
SAM: Biscotti?

00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:48.238
MATT: Yes.

00:14:48.238 --> 00:14:50.444
TALIESIN: Biscotti Islands.

00:14:50.444 --> 00:14:55.373
MATT: To that degree, you guys have a few days of
travel, anything you'd like to accomplish in this

00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:59.605
time? You've taken a long rest for the first
evening. You're restored if you need to restore

00:14:59.605 --> 00:15:00.930
your spells and hit points.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.740
SAM: I have a small list.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.498
MATT: What is your small list, Nott?

00:15:04.498 --> 00:15:10.790
SAM: Okay, you said that we have some cannons
aboard. Do we have gunpowder?

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.677
MATT: Yes.

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:20.574
SAM: Okay. I would like to fashion, if I can,
three more explosive arrowheads for myself, if possible?

00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:21.979
MATT: Sure!

00:15:21.979 --> 00:15:23.394
SAM: Or attempt to.

00:15:23.394 --> 00:15:29.420
MATT: Sure, let's do it. Let's give it a shot.
Roll a tinkering check.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.167
SAM: Three times?

00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:33.245
TRAVIS: Can you do that up in the crow's nest,
please?

00:15:33.245 --> 00:15:35.855
SAM: Right in the belly of the ship.

00:15:35.855 --> 00:15:39.783
MATT: Are you proficient with the tinker's tools?

00:15:39.783 --> 00:15:46.868
SAM: I have tinker's tools. Where do I see--

00:15:46.868 --> 00:15:48.567
LAURA: How can you tell if you're proficient?

00:15:48.567 --> 00:15:50.311
MATT: It's under your proficiencies.

00:15:50.311 --> 00:15:52.264
TRAVIS: Yeah, which on D&amp;D Beyond--

00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:53.698
LAURA: Oh, proficiencies and languages.

00:15:53.698 --> 00:15:54.931
SAM: Where's that?

00:15:54.931 --> 00:15:56.533
LAURA: Scroll up... no.

00:15:56.533 --> 00:16:00.288
SAM: Nope. But I am good with chemistry.

00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:01.448
MATT: You are!

00:16:01.448 --> 00:16:02.822
SAM: Which is part of the deal.

00:16:02.822 --> 00:16:05.038
LAURA: Alchemist's supplies.

00:16:05.038 --> 00:16:10.967
MATT: It's already powder. It's already explosive.
You're just constructing a casing and a means of

00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:15.197
detonation. Just roll and add your dexterity
modifier.

00:16:15.197 --> 00:16:16.453
SAM: Three times?

00:16:16.453 --> 00:16:17.166
MATT: Yes.

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:25.705
SAM: All right. Two, 11, 13! Plus four. So 17, 15,
low.

00:16:25.705 --> 00:16:28.374
MATT: Okay. You make two.

00:16:28.374 --> 00:16:30.267
SAM: Hey! That's great.

00:16:30.267 --> 00:16:31.704
MATT: The third one...

00:16:31.704 --> 00:16:33.076
SAM: Oh no.

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:36.177
MATT: In the crow's nest, as Fjord--

00:16:36.177 --> 00:16:38.389
SAM: No, I'm down near the cannons.

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:39.426
MATT: Okay.

00:16:39.426 --> 00:16:41.427
SAM: That's where the gunpowder is.

00:16:41.427 --> 00:16:43.100
TRAVIS: Why would you be anywhere else?

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.027
TALIESIN: Literally the first thing they teach
you.

00:16:45.027 --> 00:16:51.468
MATT: The first one goes by easy as heck. You're
proud of yourself. Second one, a little tenuous,

00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:57.040
but you manage to craft it, and that's nice. The
third one, roll a perception check.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.427
SAM: Three!

00:16:58.427 --> 00:17:01.609
LAURA: Plus what?

00:17:01.609 --> 00:17:03.100
SAM: Plus zero.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.473
LAURA: Oh no.

00:17:04.473 --> 00:17:11.482
MATT: You, in all the excitement, and your mind's
eye focusing entirely on all the wonderful

00:17:11.482 --> 00:17:18.465
explosions this is going to cause, aren't paying
attention to the wire you're using to seal off

00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:27.777
where the head of the explosive bolt goes. As you
pull, through a series of lucky circumstances, a

00:17:27.777 --> 00:17:36.793
spark gets hit. There's a brief moment where you
hear that (hissing) and you're like "Oh!" There's

00:17:36.793 --> 00:17:40.413
just a flash. Roll a dexterity check for me-- a
dexterity saving throw.

00:17:40.413 --> 00:17:41.629
SAM: Two!

00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:45.488
LAURA: It's at an angle! Move your fucking thing!

00:17:45.488 --> 00:17:46.802
SAM: It is at an angle.

00:17:46.802 --> 00:17:48.400
MATT: It's still a two, though. Plus?

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:56.366
SAM: Plus seven, but wait! Don't I have something
on dexterity saves where I can--

00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:57.555
LAURA: You get advantage?

00:17:57.555 --> 00:18:01.078
SAM: I don't know. Don't I have something? I
should know my shit!

00:18:01.078 --> 00:18:03.816
MATT: You really should!

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.878
MARISHA: You have evasion.

00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:12.659
SAM: What's evasion? It's an area effect! So if
it's a big explosion, maybe?

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:16.990
MATT: Correct! Unless your cloak gives you
advantage on dexterity saving throws?

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.682
SAM: No.

00:18:17.682 --> 00:18:19.819
TRAVIS: Can you uncanny dodge a shitty dex roll?

00:18:19.819 --> 00:18:22.077
LIAM: If you fail, it's half damage, not full
damage.

00:18:22.077 --> 00:18:24.218
MATT: Correct. So you failed.

00:18:24.218 --> 00:18:25.034
SAM: Okay.

00:18:25.034 --> 00:18:28.927
LIAM: Hello! I hear you're trying to do a rogue
action.

00:18:28.927 --> 00:18:35.985
MATT: In that explosion, 13 points of fire damage
you suffer, halved because of your evasion trait,

00:18:35.985 --> 00:18:42.629
so that'll put us at six. You take six points of
fire damage as there's this brief explosion that

00:18:42.629 --> 00:18:46.997
rocks the vicinity and your ears ring. You grab
the sides of your face as your eyes attempt to

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:54.605
focus. In that brief instant, you see a shape move
through the center of the galley.

00:18:54.605 --> 00:18:57.344
MARISHA: What?

00:18:57.344 --> 00:18:59.676
TRAVIS: We have a fucking stowaway.

00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:08.120
SAM: Oh shit! First of all, am I singed? Did the
other arrows-- Is everything safe? Is anything

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.388
else going to blow up? Any other fire?

00:19:10.388 --> 00:19:12.647
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:19:12.647 --> 00:19:14.005
SAM: Six!

00:19:14.005 --> 00:19:17.516
MATT: Everything seems safe!

00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:19.832
MARISHA: Just get them all out.

00:19:19.832 --> 00:19:23.293
TRAVIS: Caleb! Jester! Beau! Everybody, below
decks! Find out what that was!

00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:25.326
SAM: No, everything's fine!

00:19:25.326 --> 00:19:26.452
TRAVIS: That you, Nott?

00:19:26.452 --> 00:19:28.320
SAM: I'll climb up. It's okay!

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.778
TRAVIS: What did you do?

00:19:29.778 --> 00:19:33.546
MATT: As you guys look up, you can see this
smattering of dark soot all across her face. The

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:34.745
hair's scattered.

00:19:34.745 --> 00:19:38.346
LAURA: Oh no, Nott! Are you injured?

00:19:38.346 --> 00:19:45.119
SAM: There was a booby trap set by Avantika! But I
found it and disarmed it! It's all right. We're

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:46.989
safe now.

00:19:46.989 --> 00:19:49.469
TRAVIS: I'm glad you survived. There's a lot of
gunpowder down there!

00:19:49.469 --> 00:19:54.100
SAM: I know. I was just making sure that we were
safe and we definitely are now!

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.156
LAURA: Cure Wounds.

00:19:56.156 --> 00:19:58.841
SAM: Thank you!

00:19:58.841 --> 00:20:02.712
LIAM: Do you need to have any company below?

00:20:02.712 --> 00:20:09.055
SAM: No, I'll be okay below. But Beauregard?

00:20:09.055 --> 00:20:09.586
MARISHA: Yeah?

00:20:09.586 --> 00:20:14.947
SAM: In Halfling, I will say to her: There's
someone hiding downstairs. We need to act fast,

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:20.779
but don't alert the others yet; they'll overreact!
You and I are the calm and steady ones. We can

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:21.729
deal with this.

00:20:21.729 --> 00:20:24.504
TRAVIS: Nott! What is coming out of your mouth
right now?

00:20:24.504 --> 00:20:25.563
SAM: Sorry.

00:20:25.563 --> 00:20:28.142
MARISHA: We were saying our daily prayers.

00:20:28.142 --> 00:20:29.925
TRAVIS: Y'all have daily prayers?

00:20:29.925 --> 00:20:32.943
MARISHA: Yeah, it's called, "Get the fuck out of
our business."

00:20:32.943 --> 00:20:35.909
TRAVIS: That's a lot of heat.

00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:40.164
MARISHA: Sorry. I've been on a boat for a very
long time.

00:20:40.164 --> 00:20:49.961
SAM: I just don't want us to all go down there and
scare away whatever it is-- oh, no I'm still in Halfling!

00:20:50.679 --> 00:21:01.716
MARISHA: You're sure we shouldn't let Fjord know?
Or we should just handle it?

00:21:01.716 --> 00:21:02.846
SAM: What do you think?

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.345
MARISHA: Do we kill them?

00:21:04.345 --> 00:21:06.764
SAM: Who, Fjord?! He hasn't done anything to us!

00:21:06.764 --> 00:21:07.636
MARISHA: No!

00:21:07.636 --> 00:21:10.594
TALIESIN: Ah, I heard your name. Whatever they're
saying, I heard your name.

00:21:10.594 --> 00:21:14.324
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? You heard that; it was like:
(gibberish) Fjord (gibberish).

00:21:14.324 --> 00:21:16.594
SAM: I don't know how to translate it!

00:21:16.594 --> 00:21:22.589
LIAM: Caleb starts speaking in Zemnian: What are
we doing? What are you talking about? This seems

00:21:22.589 --> 00:21:24.224
rude to me! What is going on?

00:21:24.224 --> 00:21:26.027
TALIESIN: What language were you speaking?

00:21:26.027 --> 00:21:26.872
LIAM: Zemnian.

00:21:26.872 --> 00:21:28.899
TALIESIN: Goddamn it, I don't know that one.

00:21:28.899 --> 00:21:30.876
SAM: Gather close, everyone.

00:21:30.876 --> 00:21:32.761
LAURA: I gather in Infernal.

00:21:32.761 --> 00:21:36.284
(laughter)

00:21:36.284 --> 00:21:45.306
SAM: In Common: there might be someone down below,
hiding. In my exploration, I might have seen a

00:21:45.306 --> 00:21:49.482
shape moving down there. I don't want us to go
charging down there and blow up--!

00:21:49.482 --> 00:21:51.420
LAURA: (shouting) It's the Traveler!

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.595
SAM: Shh! Not too loud!

00:21:53.595 --> 00:21:56.809
TRAVIS: Are you sure there are no more booby traps
below?

00:21:56.809 --> 00:22:04.561
SAM: I don't think so. This one was very specific
in its design, seemed to be a one-of-a-kind thing,

00:22:04.561 --> 00:22:05.451
I hope.

00:22:05.451 --> 00:22:09.717
TRAVIS: Can you go back down there? Take Beau,
Jester with you, and we will stay up here to make

00:22:09.717 --> 00:22:14.849
sure they don't get by you on the way out, but you
need to find whomever or whatever that was and

00:22:14.849 --> 00:22:16.045
isolate it.

00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:17.811
SAM: Isolate!

00:22:17.811 --> 00:22:18.662
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:22:18.662 --> 00:22:20.323
SAM: Contain!

00:22:20.323 --> 00:22:21.675
TRAVIS: Exactly.

00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:22.774
SAM: Kill!

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:25.310
LAURA: What if it's Vera? Do you think it could be
Vera?

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.492
SAM: Didn't she die?

00:22:26.492 --> 00:22:30.652
TRAVIS: No, she didn't. She was in shackles next
to the ogre, right?

00:22:30.652 --> 00:22:37.745
MATT: No, last you saw Vera she was burned pretty
bad.

00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:40.864
LIAM: He was vague about his wording at that
moment.

00:22:40.864 --> 00:22:45.482
TRAVIS: But! Isolate and contain, go now!

00:22:45.482 --> 00:22:47.258
MARISHA: (quick footsteps)

00:22:47.258 --> 00:22:47.967
LAURA: Okay!

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:49.977
TALIESIN: Try not to do it-- well--

00:22:49.977 --> 00:22:54.574
MARISHA: Before I go down I go: Fjord. Sorry for
being a dick. Then just go.

00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:55.917
TRAVIS: Apologies.

00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:57.650
TALIESIN: That's an improvement.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:58.632
TRAVIS: Growth.

00:22:58.632 --> 00:22:59.959
TALIESIN: That's impressive.

00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:02.104
TRAVIS: (singing) Character arc!

00:23:02.104 --> 00:23:04.361
TALIESIN: Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:23:04.361 --> 00:23:05.699
MATT: Beau and Nott?

00:23:05.699 --> 00:23:07.130
SAM: You said Jester, too.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.805
LAURA: Me too!

00:23:07.805 --> 00:23:11.467
TALIESIN: I'm going stay and keep an eye out on
deck.

00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:18.837
MATT: The three of you head down past the galley,
or the kitchen where you originally saw the shape

00:23:18.921 --> 00:23:29.821
move. You're now towards the center where the
cannons and the accessible stores of gunpowder

00:23:29.821 --> 00:23:36.119
are. You guys can see the scarring mark on the
wood there where the previous explosion happened.

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:44.529
SAM: (talking through his teeth) Near the galley
is where I saw the thing move.

00:23:44.529 --> 00:23:46.216
LAURA: Do I see anything?

00:23:46.216 --> 00:23:48.445
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:23:48.445 --> 00:23:52.473
SAM: Ooh, so much better then mine.

00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:53.681
LAURA: 23!

00:23:53.681 --> 00:24:05.035
MATT: Okay then. You glance past the galley; you
don't see any movement. You glance across the

00:24:05.035 --> 00:24:11.617
opposite side near where the stairway leads into
the cargo hold below. You look past and you swear

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:16.984
you see something looking back from around one of
the barrels, then disappear behind it, and you

00:24:16.984 --> 00:24:18.531
hear (light footsteps).

00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:21.497
LAURA: Hey! Hello? We saw you.

00:24:21.497 --> 00:24:25.604
SAM: Is there a way to flank around behind
wherever that shape was?

00:24:25.604 --> 00:24:30.177
MATT: It's possible. Where you saw it was right
next to the stairs that lead down into the cargo

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:36.597
hold. Whatever the shape was, it moved behind one
of the large barrels there, made a run for it,

00:24:36.597 --> 00:24:39.263
hoping it wouldn't be seen, and then went
downstairs.

00:24:39.263 --> 00:24:40.675
LAURA: Downstairs.

00:24:40.675 --> 00:24:41.863
MARISHA: It went downstairs?

00:24:41.863 --> 00:24:43.318
MATT: Into the cargo hold, yes.

00:24:43.318 --> 00:24:44.692
LAURA and MARISHA: Let's go.

00:24:44.692 --> 00:24:50.049
MARISHA: Yeah, we go downstairs. I quietly dart
forward to block off the path.

00:24:50.049 --> 00:24:54.257
MATT: Okay, so blocking off the area. Everyone
make a stealth check, please.

00:24:54.257 --> 00:24:55.376
SAM: Hood up.

00:24:55.376 --> 00:24:57.977
LAURA: Oh! (whispering) I bless you!

00:24:57.977 --> 00:24:59.556
MARISHA: (whispering) Okay. What is it?

00:24:59.556 --> 00:25:00.823
LAURA: (whispering) You get advantage.

00:25:00.823 --> 00:25:02.384
MARISHA: (whispering) Oh, that's cool.

00:25:02.384 --> 00:25:03.649
LAURA: (whispering) Oh, natural one.

00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:07.703
MARISHA: Natural 20! Thanks for that blessing!

00:25:07.703 --> 00:25:09.596
LAURA: Bless you! (clattering)

00:25:09.596 --> 00:25:14.773
(laughter)

00:25:14.773 --> 00:25:15.331
SAM: 23.

00:25:15.331 --> 00:25:22.063
MATT: Okay, that tips the scales a bit, then. You
guys are quietly making your way down there,

00:25:22.063 --> 00:25:28.692
hearing the creaking of wood and the very faint,
muffled sounds of waves crashing against the

00:25:28.692 --> 00:25:35.094
outside of the Squalleater. You see a shape duck
down even further back in the cargo hold behind

00:25:35.094 --> 00:25:37.090
one of the box clusters.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.124
LAURA: Can we see what it looked like?

00:25:39.124 --> 00:25:41.681
MATT: It's too far away and there's no light down
there.

00:25:41.681 --> 00:25:43.776
LAURA: Too bad I can't make light.

00:25:43.776 --> 00:25:46.235
SAM: Why did he send us three?

00:25:46.235 --> 00:25:48.461
MARISHA: I put on my night-vision goggles.

00:25:48.461 --> 00:25:50.593
MATT: All of you have darkvision, as long as you
have the goggles on.

00:25:50.593 --> 00:25:54.135
SAM: Do you want me to go scare it out or
something?

00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:55.941
LAURA: Yeah.

00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:57.748
SAM: I don't know how to do that.

00:25:57.748 --> 00:26:00.976
LAURA: Oh. Me neither.

00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:03.077
MARISHA: (whispering) What? You can be scary!

00:26:03.077 --> 00:26:05.382
SAM: Ooh! Your duplicate!

00:26:05.382 --> 00:26:09.664
LAURA: Okay, I was going to say Thaumaturgy, but
yeah.

00:26:09.664 --> 00:26:10.821
SAM: Do that, too!

00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:14.404
LAURA: Okay, I use Thaumaturgy and I send-- I
don't want to use my duplicate.

00:26:14.404 --> 00:26:16.077
SAM: Just send the Thaumaturgy, then.

00:26:16.077 --> 00:26:25.247
LAURA: And I use my duplicate! I send my duplicate
where the boxes are that they are hiding behind

00:26:25.247 --> 00:26:29.655
and at the same time I use Thaumaturgy to say:
(spooky voice) There are ghosts on the ship!

00:26:29.655 --> 00:26:36.141
MARISHA: I look at Nott. (whispering) You. Me.
Flank. Let's go.

00:26:36.141 --> 00:26:37.043
SAM: Okay.

00:26:37.043 --> 00:26:38.701
SAM and MARISHA: (quick footsteps)

00:26:38.701 --> 00:26:41.224
TRAVIS: Oh good, a little Naruto run?

00:26:41.224 --> 00:26:50.150
MATT: You guys dart around, with the booming voice
of Jester's duplicitous double. There, curved

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:55.004
around the corner you manage to all at the same
time flank in this area. As you get around the

00:26:55.004 --> 00:26:58.144
space, you can see they're huddled in the corner.
If you'd like to come to the table--

00:26:58.144 --> 00:27:02.559
(cheering)

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.864
MATT: And describe to them what they see.

00:27:07.444 --> 00:27:13.163
DEBORAH: Sitting in the tiniest little corner, in
the littlest ball, I have created an illusion of a

00:27:13.437 --> 00:27:20.255
halo over my head, so I look like a perfect little
angel. It's just a tiny little gnome girl. You

00:27:20.255 --> 00:27:26.493
would have no idea how old I am. I'm really cute,
and there's sticks in my hair, and I got singed a

00:27:26.493 --> 00:27:31.250
little bit, so one cheek's covered in soot. I have
really pretty necklaces.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.469
LAURA: (gasps)

00:27:32.469 --> 00:27:35.922
DEBORAH: I go: Ghosts? Did you say ghosts? I'm
scared of ghosts!

00:27:35.922 --> 00:27:40.250
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! There's no ghosts, you're so
cute!

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:44.001
DEBORAH: There's chocolate smeared on my face as
well.

00:27:44.001 --> 00:27:49.139
LAURA: Come out! You're so cute! Is it a little
child--

00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:55.042
SAM: Jester! Fjord, said to contain! (shouting)
Get down! I'm going to point my crossbow at her.

00:27:55.042 --> 00:27:56.862
Get down! Don't say a word!

00:27:56.862 --> 00:27:59.080
LAURA: You want some candy? Come on.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:05.802
SAM: No! This is not good cop, bad cop. We're
supposed to contain! Contain!

00:28:05.802 --> 00:28:17.811
DEBORAH: At this moment, I push my hand out, and
another little hand slides off of it and comes

00:28:17.811 --> 00:28:19.774
forward. It comes into your face and goes--

00:28:19.774 --> 00:28:28.314
SAM: I mean, she's so cute! How could I do that to
you? I'm so sorry!

00:28:28.314 --> 00:28:34.714
MARISHA: Okay, okay! Okay. Who the fuck are you,
though? Seriously?

00:28:34.714 --> 00:28:36.454
TRAVIS: Who the fuck are you, though?

00:28:36.454 --> 00:28:43.067
DEBORAH: I open up my little cloak and I go:
Should we tell them? Okay! I think that-- yes! No,

00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:46.947
I think they're friendly. It's okay! So I go: I'm
Twiggy! (deeper voice) This is Trixie.

00:28:46.947 --> 00:28:50.933
TRAVIS: Oh no!

00:28:50.933 --> 00:28:52.692
SAM: Whoa!

00:28:52.692 --> 00:28:58.998
DEBORAH: Trixie's my bestest friend, and we got
stuck on this ship. But I have lots of chocolate

00:28:58.998 --> 00:29:05.190
and lots of apples. As you can tell, that's all
I've been eating! And I wonder if it's okay if I

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.483
could hang out with you guys for awhile? Until we
get to shore?

00:29:08.483 --> 00:29:12.627
SAM: What were you doing hanging out on a ship in
a pirate island?

00:29:12.627 --> 00:29:13.545
DEBORAH: Hmm!

00:29:13.545 --> 00:29:15.190
SAM: You're a little cutie pie!

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:26.499
DEBORAH: I know! So I just needed somewhere to
hide for a while, and there was this box, and it

00:29:26.499 --> 00:29:30.176
was open, and they were bringing it on a boat, so
I was like: Hey sounds like a good idea!

00:29:30.176 --> 00:29:33.342
SAM: I mean, that seems like a perfectly
reasonable explanation for me.

00:29:33.342 --> 00:29:34.568
DEBORAH: That's what I thought!

00:29:34.568 --> 00:29:35.810
LAURA: What does Trixie look like?

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.688
DEBORAH: Trixie's got a big bushy tail, and a cute
little-- do you want to see?

00:29:39.688 --> 00:29:40.313
LAURA: Yeah!

00:29:40.313 --> 00:29:44.098
DEBORAH: I open up my cloak and sitting in my
pocket is the tiniest, cutest little squirrel

00:29:44.098 --> 00:29:47.222
you've ever seen, with the tiniest little nose.

00:29:47.222 --> 00:29:54.347
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Trixie would love Sprinkle! My
little crimson weasel pops out from the hood on my cloak.

00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:58.279
DEBORAH: I let Trixie run down my arm, and they
boop noses.

00:29:58.279 --> 00:29:59.604
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

00:29:59.604 --> 00:30:01.906
DEBORAH: This is a very girly game today.

00:30:01.906 --> 00:30:05.407
MARISHA: Okay, I feel like we're--

00:30:05.407 --> 00:30:10.879
SAM: I pull out my dead rabbit's foot that I have.
I have this, too! It's something.

00:30:10.879 --> 00:30:12.344
LAURA: It's so cute.

00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:20.722
MARISHA: We're letting the cuteness distract us!
Why were you hiding? Sorry, sorry. Why did you

00:30:20.722 --> 00:30:26.103
feel the need to hide? What did you do?

00:30:26.103 --> 00:30:29.823
DEBORAH: Well, I'm really nice, but I don't always
make the best decisions.

00:30:29.823 --> 00:30:31.140
MARISHA: I can relate.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:31.727
DEBORAH: Right?

00:30:31.727 --> 00:30:32.628
MARISHA: I'm so nice.

00:30:32.628 --> 00:30:39.912
DEBORAH: Totally. I don't know. There was this
really pretty thing, and this really bad guy was

00:30:39.912 --> 00:30:44.832
going to get it. I was like, that's not fair,
right? So I took it, okay. I took it. You don't

00:30:44.832 --> 00:30:45.780
care, right?

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.367
LAURA: What is the pretty thing?

00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:49.314
SAM: What sort of thing?

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:52.342
DEBORAH: I don't know, you guys. It's kind of
tricky.

00:30:52.342 --> 00:30:53.680
LAURA: Okay.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.756
SAM: Do you have it?

00:30:56.756 --> 00:31:01.414
DEBORAH: Yeah. I look at you all. I say: I never
let it leave my side. I turn around and go in my

00:31:01.414 --> 00:31:05.641
bag, and I'm digging through my bag. I'm like:
It's not this, not that one. I've got all these

00:31:05.641 --> 00:31:10.979
little trinkets of things, even little drawings
that I've made and stuff like that. They're little

00:31:10.979 --> 00:31:19.184
houses and clouds and stuff. I pull out this
thing, and it's a sphere. It's made of all these

00:31:19.184 --> 00:31:23.966
intricate little puzzle pieces. I'm like: See, I
can move it around, but I'm not quite sure what it

00:31:23.966 --> 00:31:26.142
does. But it's clearly really pretty.

00:31:26.142 --> 00:31:27.484
LAURA: Can I touch it?

00:31:27.484 --> 00:31:33.354
MATT: In her gnomish hands, this is pretty large.
From your perspective, it would be about that big,

00:31:33.354 --> 00:31:38.464
but for her it seems even that much bigger. It's a
brass and golden sphere that consists of many

00:31:38.464 --> 00:31:45.512
layers of intertwining clockwork, sliding
hemispheres, rotating bands, and strange

00:31:45.512 --> 00:31:57.035
inscriptions. It's this massive, complicated mess
of contraption, puzzle, sliding pieces.

00:31:57.035 --> 00:31:58.743
LAURA: Does it seem magical?

00:31:58.743 --> 00:32:00.692
MATT: Make an arcana check.

00:32:00.692 --> 00:32:06.706
LAURA: Whoa. That's cocked. Ooh.

00:32:06.706 --> 00:32:07.493
SAM: Amazing roll.

00:32:07.493 --> 00:32:08.672
LAURA: 19.

00:32:08.672 --> 00:32:18.137
MATT: 19. While she holds it out to you, parts
that she's not touching are shifting slightly to

00:32:18.137 --> 00:32:22.995
where it has a clockwork feel. But then you don't
see any gears in the parts that are shifting.

00:32:22.995 --> 00:32:28.589
They're sliding naturally, with a very faint whir.
You can tell there's probably some magic involved,

00:32:28.589 --> 00:32:30.963
but it's a combination of clockwork and magic.

00:32:30.963 --> 00:32:38.762
SAM: It's just that we're surrounded by gunpowder
down here, so maybe not right now.

00:32:38.762 --> 00:32:41.365
DEBORAH: I've been playing with it for weeks.
Don't worry.

00:32:41.365 --> 00:32:43.907
LAURA: Have you solved it? Is it a puzzle?

00:32:43.907 --> 00:32:48.529
DEBORAH: No, but it can do this. Can I do the
thing?

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:49.366
MATT: You may.

00:32:49.366 --> 00:32:52.764
DEBORAH: I put my hand on one side, and I pull
back one ring. As it pulls around across, at the

00:32:52.764 --> 00:32:56.406
same time, I click another one to the side. It
slides around the side and--

00:32:56.406 --> 00:33:04.070
MATT: As the last part clicks into place, there's
a (whir, puff), a burst of light. About 15 gold

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.825
coins go (clanging) to the ground in front.

00:33:06.825 --> 00:33:08.888
TALIESIN: That's how you get a Pinhead, man.
Nope.

00:33:08.888 --> 00:33:13.519
(laughter)

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:17.809
LAURA: Wow, we have gold coins. Is it real gold
coins? Is it fake gold coins like you and Caleb did?

00:33:17.822 --> 00:33:19.269
MATT: You crack a tooth.

00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:22.445
SAM: Didn't need that one. It's real!

00:33:22.445 --> 00:33:28.177
LAURA: Wow, that's the coolest thing ever. We just
have this lame old dodecahedron.

00:33:28.177 --> 00:33:29.466
SAM: Don't show her that.

00:33:29.466 --> 00:33:31.788
DEBORAH: Oh, you've got cool stuff too?

00:33:31.788 --> 00:33:32.551
SAM: We do.

00:33:32.551 --> 00:33:34.316
DEBORAH: I showed you my stuff.

00:33:34.316 --> 00:33:35.721
LAURA: She showed her stuff.

00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:37.971
SAM: I can't argue with that, either.

00:33:37.971 --> 00:33:41.977
MARISHA: Okay, I got-- ah, it's happening.

00:33:41.977 --> 00:33:47.998
LAURA: We have this thing that, if you look really
hard at it, you have a special gift. You should

00:33:47.998 --> 00:33:49.153
look at it.

00:33:49.153 --> 00:33:54.507
MATT: What she reveals, as she pulls out of this
bright pink satchel, this colored leather satchel

00:33:54.507 --> 00:34:00.912
she has, is this dodecahedron shape that has gold
trim around the edges and these handles. It looks

00:34:00.912 --> 00:34:07.203
like a gray quartz, and it has a very faint hum to
it. It seems to glow in a rhythmic, heartbeat

00:34:07.203 --> 00:34:13.688
fashion. It has this very strong presence, and the
air around it has its own subtle vibration.

00:34:13.688 --> 00:34:15.816
LAURA: If you want to look at it, that's cool.

00:34:15.816 --> 00:34:27.639
DEBORAH: Yeah, okay. I lean over it, and my eyes
are huge, twice the size of my head. Not twice the

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.454
size, sorry. They take up half my head.

00:34:29.454 --> 00:34:30.989
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:34.956
DEBORAH: They take up the whole top half of my
face.

00:34:34.956 --> 00:34:36.854
LIAM: That's pretty freaky, too.

00:34:36.854 --> 00:34:43.966
DEBORAH: Like the big-eyes pictures. I'm looking
into it, and my eyes are reflected back off the

00:34:43.966 --> 00:34:49.194
thing. I stare, and I let it wash over me.

00:34:49.194 --> 00:34:56.830
MATT: Which, as you do that, you feel this
gravitational pull, your essence drawn towards it.

00:34:57.185 --> 00:35:06.022
Your peripheral blurs and darkens. Within, you
feel like you're leaning into it. It's no longer

00:35:06.022 --> 00:35:11.745
an object; it's like a pool of water, and you
cross the surface, and it's warm. Past that, in

00:35:11.745 --> 00:35:17.740
the darkness, you see stars, an endless sea of
stars drifting towards you and past you. You look

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:23.475
ahead, and you can see other little shapes. You
look at them, and they're you. They're little

00:35:23.475 --> 00:35:29.350
ghosted versions of Twiggy. They're all going in
different directions, and some of them fade, and

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:35.015
some of them are created. Two of them join and
create a new light and go in a separate path. In

00:35:35.015 --> 00:35:42.879
that moment, you see this single, glowing, warm
light that appears and presents itself to you.

00:35:42.879 --> 00:35:46.780
DEBORAH: I totally reach out and touch it.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:52.628
MATT: As you reach out and put your hand towards
it, it merges with your hand. The warmth carries

00:35:52.628 --> 00:35:56.312
through your wrist and forearm.

00:35:56.312 --> 00:35:57.634
DEBORAH: I giggle.

00:35:57.634 --> 00:36:03.061
MATT: It gives this warm, interior hug-type
sensation. As you close your eyes to relish in it

00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:06.157
and open them again, you're back on the boat with
them.

00:36:06.157 --> 00:36:08.784
LAURA: When you open your eyes, I've got the
thing, and I'm totally fucking with it.

00:36:08.784 --> 00:36:12.488
(laughter)

00:36:12.488 --> 00:36:14.500
LAURA: It's pretty cool, huh?

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.620
SAM: No, we should really have Caleb look at this.
He's much smarter than any of us down here.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.632
DEBORAH: I take it, and I roll it across the
floor.

00:36:21.632 --> 00:36:26.325
SAM: No! Beau, get it! Get the thing! Get the
ball!

00:36:26.325 --> 00:36:31.296
LAURA: I put the dodecahedron back in the bag.

00:36:31.296 --> 00:36:36.842
MATT: Okay. As a note, you have what's called a
Fragment of Possibility. For the rest of the day,

00:36:36.842 --> 00:36:40.590
anytime you have to make an attack roll, an
ability check, or a saving throw, any roll with a

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:45.866
d20, essentially, you get to reroll it. You get to
roll an additional d20 and choose which of the two

00:36:45.866 --> 00:36:47.142
to take.

00:36:47.142 --> 00:36:47.945
DEBORAH: Just once?

00:36:47.945 --> 00:36:49.019
MATT: Just once.

00:36:49.019 --> 00:36:50.112
SAM: One luck.

00:36:50.112 --> 00:36:52.108
DEBORAH: After I've rolled it, I can choose?

00:36:52.108 --> 00:36:53.468
MATT: Yeah.

00:36:53.468 --> 00:36:53.732
DEBORAH: Cool!

00:36:53.732 --> 00:37:02.639
MARISHA: Hey, Twiggy. Now that you've looked at
the fragment, you're bonded to us, which means if

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:05.932
you betray us, we'll know how to find you.

00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:15.230
DEBORAH: Oh, wow. Well, that sounds pretty
serious! So cool with me. I like people. I like

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.585
hanging out with people. I like trusting people.
So that sounds great.

00:37:18.585 --> 00:37:20.376
LAURA: This is awesome.

00:37:20.376 --> 00:37:22.101
SAM: These are all the right answers.

00:37:22.101 --> 00:37:24.429
LAURA: We should go upstairs and show you to
everyone else.

00:37:24.429 --> 00:37:28.632
DEBORAH: I'd love to be shown. I have a dance!

00:37:28.632 --> 00:37:30.480
LAURA: Oh my gosh. I dance behind her.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.631
DEBORAH: I turn around and my skirts goes flying
up and everything.

00:37:33.631 --> 00:37:36.797
LAURA: What is this? This is the best day in the
universe!

00:37:36.797 --> 00:37:39.642
TRAVIS: Does she still have chocolate all over her
face?

00:37:39.642 --> 00:37:44.530
DEBORAH: Oh, totally. As we go up to the next
level, I take you to my box where I've been living

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:50.239
for the last week. It is filled with apple cores
and chocolate wrappers and stuff.

00:37:50.239 --> 00:37:52.665
MARISHA: Is there--

00:37:52.665 --> 00:37:53.890
SAM: A stench of urine?

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:54.664
MARISHA: Yes.

00:37:54.664 --> 00:38:02.824
DEBORAH: As you say that I go: Oof. I motion to a
corner in the back, and I was like: I'm surprised

00:38:02.824 --> 00:38:06.841
you guys didn't notice that earlier. It's pretty
bad over there.

00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:11.904
SAM: That's my bad. I'm down here a lot. I thought
it was me.

00:38:11.904 --> 00:38:13.698
TRAVIS: Real perceptive, rogue.

00:38:13.698 --> 00:38:17.379
SAM: Let's go introduce you to the others.

00:38:17.379 --> 00:38:20.403
DEBORAH: Oh, but I'm a little shy. Who am I
meeting?

00:38:20.403 --> 00:38:24.990
LAURA: You're meeting Fjord, and you're meeting
Caleb, and you're meeting Caduceus, and you're

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.133
meeting Yasha.

00:38:26.133 --> 00:38:28.968
SAM: Okay, so they're all big. They're all bigs.

00:38:28.968 --> 00:38:30.044
DEBORAH: I'm little.

00:38:30.044 --> 00:38:33.146
LIAM: Which one of these two is taller?

00:38:33.146 --> 00:38:38.321
MATT: Actually, probably even keel between the two
of you.

00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:40.875
DEBORAH: Nice! We should come up with a dance.

00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:46.200
SAM: Sure, yes. Yes, we can choreograph something.
We've done that before.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.003
DEBORAH: Have you?

00:38:47.003 --> 00:38:50.098
LAURA: Yeah, it's something like this. Then you do
this.

00:38:50.098 --> 00:38:51.594
DEBORAH: You'll have to teach me.

00:38:51.594 --> 00:38:54.382
LAURA: Yeah. It's a lot of wiggling of your hips,
and it looks pretty cool.

00:38:54.382 --> 00:39:03.262
SAM: No, they're all big, so don't be intimidated.
One of them is a big cow man, but he's cool.

00:39:03.262 --> 00:39:05.038
LAURA: He's got pink hair; he's really pretty.

00:39:05.038 --> 00:39:11.101
SAM: There's a stony-faced, harbinger of
death-type lady.

00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:13.486
LAURA: She's got wings that are so magical.

00:39:13.486 --> 00:39:17.292
SAM: She's pretty cool, though. She's cool. She
likes flowers.

00:39:17.292 --> 00:39:22.078
DEBORAH: I like flowers! I dig in the back of my
hair into a rat's nest, and I pull out a really

00:39:22.078 --> 00:39:24.033
old, wilted, dying flower.

00:39:24.033 --> 00:39:26.781
LAURA: See, Yasha will love that because it's dry
like that.

00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:29.824
SAM: I do the same. I also put flowers in my hair
sometimes.

00:39:29.824 --> 00:39:31.145
LAURA: That's really cool.

00:39:31.145 --> 00:39:32.680
DEBORAH: Best friends!

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.749
SAM: Well, I mean, I don't want to--

00:39:34.749 --> 00:39:36.693
LAURA: No, it's fine. You guys can be best
friends.

00:39:36.693 --> 00:39:40.722
SAM: No, no! I think she meant all of us. I think
she meant all of us. It's okay. You can be--

00:39:40.722 --> 00:39:44.918
DEBORAH: We put the flowers behind her ears.
They're really old and wilted.

00:39:44.918 --> 00:39:46.552
LAURA: Thanks, you guys.

00:39:46.552 --> 00:39:51.099
MATT: At this point, around the side, Marius
LePual has walked down into the center of the ship

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:55.992
and is standing there. "Who the fuck is that?"

00:39:55.992 --> 00:39:57.333
LAURA: Our new best friend.

00:39:57.333 --> 00:39:58.172
DEBORAH: Twiggy!

00:39:58.172 --> 00:40:04.186
MARISHA: Marius, please god, save me. Marius,
let's go.

00:40:04.186 --> 00:40:06.853
MATT: "You're all scaring me right now. I'm going
to go lay down."

00:40:06.853 --> 00:40:09.031
DEBORAH: I'll follow them up.

00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:12.940
MATT: Okay, you guys all make you your way back up
to the deck of the Squalleater. As you hear the

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:19.127
footsteps rising, you look back to hopefully hear
information about how things went down with the

00:40:19.127 --> 00:40:25.091
supposed sound and stowaway. Instead, you see them
arrive with Twiggy.

00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:27.318
DEBORAH: (sings a riff)

00:40:27.318 --> 00:40:29.073
TRAVIS: What is that?

00:40:29.073 --> 00:40:30.004
MARISHA: That's what we found.

00:40:30.004 --> 00:40:33.624
LAURA: (singing) She's so cute. This was
downstairs. She's the cutest ever.

00:40:33.624 --> 00:40:35.275
TRAVIS: Is that mud on her face?

00:40:35.275 --> 00:40:36.530
SAM: That's chocolate.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:37.256
TRAVIS: Chocolate.

00:40:37.256 --> 00:40:39.526
DEBORAH: Mm-hmm. You want some?

00:40:39.526 --> 00:40:41.623
MARISHA: This is Twiggy.

00:40:41.623 --> 00:40:42.333
TRAVIS: Twiggy.

00:40:42.333 --> 00:40:44.424
LAURA: This is Captain Tusktooth. He runs the
ship.

00:40:44.424 --> 00:40:46.070
DEBORAH: Oh, wow, thank you so much.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.677
TRAVIS: You can call me Fjord. That's not
necessary.

00:40:48.677 --> 00:40:50.359
DEBORAH: Captain Fjord!

00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:52.445
TRAVIS: Sure. Captain Fjord works.

00:40:52.445 --> 00:40:54.840
DEBORAH: Fjordy. Fjord and a half.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.075
TRAVIS: This is Caleb.

00:40:56.075 --> 00:40:58.382
DEBORAH: Fjorda people.

00:40:58.382 --> 00:41:03.238
SAM: Caleb is very smart, and he's good with
magic. He can probably determine what you're

00:41:03.238 --> 00:41:05.626
carrying, what that ball was that Beau has now.

00:41:05.626 --> 00:41:09.782
LIAM: Who-- what-- how-- why are you on the boat?

00:41:09.782 --> 00:41:16.990
DEBORAH: Just hanging out! Going for a trip, you
know? Seeing the world.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.313
SAM: It seemed legit.

00:41:18.313 --> 00:41:20.452
MARISHA: I call Caduceus over. Caduceus?

00:41:20.452 --> 00:41:22.433
LIAM: That clarifies that, okay.

00:41:22.433 --> 00:41:25.132
MARISHA: We found a Twiggy.

00:41:25.132 --> 00:41:26.795
DEBORAH: Found a Twiggy!

00:41:26.795 --> 00:41:28.155
MARISHA: She was hiding.

00:41:28.155 --> 00:41:31.882
SAM: From bad people. Unspecified, so far.

00:41:31.882 --> 00:41:33.486
MARISHA: She stole this.

00:41:33.486 --> 00:41:35.548
DEBORAH: I was a little bit bad, but just a
little.

00:41:35.548 --> 00:41:37.686
SAM: Oh, you did something to deserve this?

00:41:37.686 --> 00:41:41.279
DEBORAH: No, I took it. That's all.

00:41:41.279 --> 00:41:47.314
TRAVIS: Yasha walks over, and bends over at the
hips, and puts her eyes right in front of Twiggy.

00:41:47.314 --> 00:41:49.308
I like her. She walks away.

00:41:49.308 --> 00:41:54.233
TALIESIN: I've got nothing, man. I don't even
know.

00:41:54.233 --> 00:41:56.825
LAURA: Fjord, can I talk to you for one moment,
please?

00:41:56.825 --> 00:41:57.721
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:41:57.721 --> 00:42:04.613
LAURA: We walk away. Just so you know, I think
she's really cool, and I don't think anything is

00:42:04.613 --> 00:42:07.317
wrong with her. I think she's the best thing in
the universe.

00:42:07.317 --> 00:42:08.288
TRAVIS: Yeah, I can tell.

00:42:08.288 --> 00:42:12.177
LAURA: But in case you're trepidatious, because I
can see on your face that maybe you are a little--

00:42:12.203 --> 00:42:13.385
TRAVIS: That's my emotion.

00:42:13.385 --> 00:42:15.626
LAURA: -- I do have Zone of Truth.

00:42:15.626 --> 00:42:17.552
TRAVIS: Fair enough. How old is she?

00:42:17.552 --> 00:42:21.455
DEBORAH: Twiggy is doing spins, whirling dervish
in the background.

00:42:21.455 --> 00:42:25.376
TALIESIN: How much chocolate have you been eating?
And for how long? Whoa. Oh, wow.

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:29.704
TRAVIS: Aren't you worried that her parents are
wondering where she is, or her family?

00:42:29.704 --> 00:42:33.986
LAURA: Oh, well, I didn't wonder about that. I
wasn't worried, but I guess I should.

00:42:33.986 --> 00:42:36.767
TRAVIS: We're in the middle of the ocean, Jester.

00:42:36.767 --> 00:42:42.132
LAURA: Okay, but her parents were probably pirates
if she was stowing away. (gasps) Twiggy!

00:42:42.132 --> 00:42:43.113
DEBORAH: Yes?

00:42:43.113 --> 00:42:45.237
LAURA: How long have you been on the ship?

00:42:45.237 --> 00:42:47.109
DEBORAH: This ship? About a week.

00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:48.686
LAURA: About a week.

00:42:48.686 --> 00:42:49.337
MARISHA: This ship?

00:42:49.337 --> 00:42:53.559
DEBORAH: Mm-hmm. Oh, sorry. Yep, took another one
before. I don't know, kind of a habit.

00:42:53.559 --> 00:42:55.482
MARISHA: Where are you from?

00:42:55.482 --> 00:43:01.337
DEBORAH: Far, far away. I'm from far, far away.

00:43:01.337 --> 00:43:03.332
MATT: Port Damali.

00:43:03.332 --> 00:43:04.700
DEBORAH: Port Damali.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.216
SAM: That's not--

00:43:06.216 --> 00:43:10.119
DEBORAH: It feels far when you're little and
you've been living in a box.

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:11.562
LAURA: It's pretty far, actually.

00:43:11.562 --> 00:43:13.557
TRAVIS: I'm actually from Port Damali.

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.474
DEBORAH: Well, howdy there, neighbor.

00:43:15.474 --> 00:43:21.893
TRAVIS: Well, howdy there. What a coincidence.
This is so crazy. Are you trying to get anywhere

00:43:21.893 --> 00:43:23.012
in particular?

00:43:23.012 --> 00:43:26.828
DEBORAH: Nope, just was trying to get away from
Port Damali.

00:43:26.828 --> 00:43:28.636
TRAVIS: I understand that.

00:43:28.636 --> 00:43:30.178
LAURA: Are your parents there?

00:43:30.178 --> 00:43:32.079
DEBORAH: Nope, no parents.

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:34.051
SAM: No parents? You're an orphan?

00:43:34.051 --> 00:43:36.185
DEBORAH: Oh, they died a while ago.

00:43:36.185 --> 00:43:40.163
SAM: So you're an orphan for a while?

00:43:40.163 --> 00:43:40.794
DEBORAH: Yep!

00:43:40.794 --> 00:43:48.518
TALIESIN: How deep are these waters? I'm trying to
figure out how much of this is-- obviously, a lot

00:43:48.518 --> 00:43:49.583
of this is bullshit.

00:43:49.583 --> 00:43:51.142
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:43:51.142 --> 00:43:52.119
TALIESIN: All right.

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:55.710
SAM: Bullshit? What are you talking about? She's
the greatest person in the world.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:56.607
TALIESIN: 22.

00:43:56.607 --> 00:43:59.973
MATT: Is there anything you want to whisper to
him? Feel free to.

00:43:59.973 --> 00:44:02.008
TALIESIN: Yeah, even just general vibe.

00:44:02.008 --> 00:44:04.773
DEBORAH: I've honestly been very honest.

00:44:04.773 --> 00:44:06.139
TALIESIN: All right, everything's been--

00:44:06.139 --> 00:44:07.089
DEBORAH: But--

00:44:07.089 --> 00:44:09.197
TALIESIN: A little omission maybe?

00:44:09.197 --> 00:44:13.337
LIAM: I am halfway through Identify on this
clockwork gizmo.

00:44:13.337 --> 00:44:15.024
MATT: Okay.

00:44:15.024 --> 00:44:21.572
SAM: Oh, she is whispering something.
dndbeyond.com/criticalrole, let them know that you

00:44:21.572 --> 00:44:24.445
came from us. Give them some love.

00:44:24.445 --> 00:44:25.459
TALIESIN: All right.

00:44:25.459 --> 00:44:28.230
TRAVIS: Wow, okay.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:32.343
TALIESIN: I honestly think we need to feed you
something that isn't chocolate.

00:44:32.343 --> 00:44:33.247
DEBORAH: Woo!

00:44:33.247 --> 00:44:35.621
MARISHA: You're a gnome, right?

00:44:35.621 --> 00:44:36.632
DEBORAH: Yep.

00:44:36.632 --> 00:44:39.407
MARISHA: Don't gnomes live for a pretty long
time?

00:44:39.407 --> 00:44:40.400
DEBORAH: Yeah.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.984
MARISHA: So you could actually be fairly old--

00:44:43.984 --> 00:44:45.218
DEBORAH: Who knows!

00:44:45.218 --> 00:44:48.012
MARISHA: -- and look pretty young. You don't know.
You don't know how old you are.

00:44:48.012 --> 00:44:52.789
DEBORAH: As you see me walk through the shadows,
in shadow I could be 60 years old, but when I step

00:44:52.789 --> 00:44:54.757
out into the light it's like, seven!

00:44:54.757 --> 00:44:56.079
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:44:56.079 --> 00:45:01.617
MARISHA: Fascinating. I don't think she's as young
as she seems.

00:45:01.617 --> 00:45:05.576
TRAVIS: Were you by yourself, Twiggy? There's no
one else we have to worry about pissing in the

00:45:05.576 --> 00:45:06.939
corner of the boat, do we?

00:45:06.939 --> 00:45:08.086
DEBORAH: No one that I know of.

00:45:08.086 --> 00:45:09.621
LAURA: Except for Trixie!

00:45:09.621 --> 00:45:10.815
TRAVIS: Who's Trixie?

00:45:10.815 --> 00:45:12.998
DEBORAH: It's okay! Don't worry, they'll like you!
They like me!

00:45:12.998 --> 00:45:14.191
TRAVIS: Who are you talking to?

00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:16.086
SAM: She's got a rodent in her pocket.

00:45:16.086 --> 00:45:16.936
TRAVIS: A rodent?

00:45:16.936 --> 00:45:18.528
DEBORAH: This is Trixie!

00:45:18.528 --> 00:45:23.053
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that? Goddamn chinchilla?
What is it?

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:25.353
TALIESIN: That's a squirrel. I know that one.

00:45:25.353 --> 00:45:26.438
SAM: It's a squirrel.

00:45:26.438 --> 00:45:27.942
DEBORAH: It's a little squirrel.

00:45:27.942 --> 00:45:30.009
TRAVIS: I don't trust squirrels; they're tree
rats.

00:45:30.009 --> 00:45:31.353
TALIESIN: Squirrels are great.

00:45:31.353 --> 00:45:32.458
LAURA: They're wonderful, Fjord.

00:45:32.458 --> 00:45:34.022
TRAVIS: You just keep it to yourself.

00:45:34.022 --> 00:45:36.485
DEBORAH: That's okay. Trixie likes it in my
pocket.

00:45:36.485 --> 00:45:38.037
MARISHA: He has an octopus.

00:45:38.037 --> 00:45:42.740
SAM: Sometimes a cat, so be careful with your
squirrel around his cat.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.321
DEBORAH: Trixie's very wily.

00:45:44.321 --> 00:45:49.650
TRAVIS: Jester, can I put you in charge of keeping
an eye on Twiggy? Twiggy, we're going to the

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:51.314
Bisaft-- what is it?

00:45:51.314 --> 00:45:52.437
MATT: Bisaft Isle.

00:45:52.437 --> 00:45:55.822
TRAVIS: Bisaft Isle. I don't know if you're
familiar with that area. We need some repairs, and

00:45:55.822 --> 00:45:58.818
then hopefully you can find your way from there.

00:45:58.818 --> 00:46:00.432
DEBORAH: Sure. Thanks!

00:46:00.432 --> 00:46:03.458
MATT: So you're concentrating on--?

00:46:03.458 --> 00:46:08.619
LIAM: I was doing a ritual casting of Identify as
soon as the thing was in my hands and not talking

00:46:08.619 --> 00:46:09.565
to anybody.

00:46:09.565 --> 00:46:11.202
MATT: Okay, so continue while you're doing that.

00:46:11.202 --> 00:46:13.397
LAURA: Let's sit down. I'll show you how to draw
the perfect dick.

00:46:13.397 --> 00:46:14.800
DEBORAH: (gasps) Perfect!

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.716
TRAVIS: Caduceus, could you make sure that she
gets some real food?

00:46:17.716 --> 00:46:21.934
TALIESIN: I was just about to go get something
with something that's not chocolate in it. That's

00:46:21.934 --> 00:46:26.846
probably for the best. I'll be back. Oh, boy.

00:46:26.846 --> 00:46:38.297
MATT: Caleb, as you finish the ritual, your vision
crystallizes on the object. As part of the

00:46:38.297 --> 00:46:42.109
Identify, the information that would transition to
you fails.

00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:45.153
SAM: Oh, shit!

00:46:45.153 --> 00:46:52.637
MATT: You've tried to Identify non-magical objects
before, and been like, oh, this isn't magical.

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:54.178
This blocks you.

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:55.569
MARISHA: Interesting.

00:46:55.569 --> 00:46:58.638
TRAVIS: Interest intensifies!

00:46:58.638 --> 00:47:03.657
LIAM: What is this thing that you have? What is
this called? Does it have a name?

00:47:03.657 --> 00:47:13.361
DEBORAH: I don't think it was on the card. I call
it my fun ball of tricks.

00:47:15.391 --> 00:47:18.350
SAM: Happy fun ball?

00:47:18.561 --> 00:47:20.293
DEBORAH: Happy fun ball.

00:47:20.293 --> 00:47:22.465
MATT: Do not solve happy fun ball.

00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:24.880
DEBORAH: Must solve happy fun ball.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.481
LAURA: Where did you get it from?

00:47:26.481 --> 00:47:29.016
LIAM: Yeah, did you make it? Did you get it from
someone else?

00:47:29.016 --> 00:47:33.088
DEBORAH: No, it was sitting somewhere, and I was
like, this is cool!

00:47:33.088 --> 00:47:35.805
LIAM: In a museum, or--?

00:47:35.805 --> 00:47:38.892
DEBORAH: Kind of, yeah. It was on a little
pedestal, and people were looking at it, and it

00:47:38.892 --> 00:47:44.582
had a little card on it. Then I saw this guy, and
I was like, he's a mean man, and I said--

00:47:44.582 --> 00:47:46.733
SAM: Was he the docent or something?

00:47:46.733 --> 00:47:51.816
DEBORAH: No, he wasn't wearing a uniform or
anything.

00:47:51.816 --> 00:47:56.668
SAM: Why did you think he was mean? What gave off
that impression?

00:47:56.668 --> 00:47:58.797
DEBORAH: (whispering) I've seen him before.

00:47:58.797 --> 00:47:59.713
SAM: You know him?

00:47:59.713 --> 00:48:00.408
DEBORAH: Yeah.

00:48:00.408 --> 00:48:01.383
SAM: Oh.

00:48:01.383 --> 00:48:03.206
DEBORAH: He's a rascally man.

00:48:03.206 --> 00:48:04.720
LIAM: What's his name?

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.488
DEBORAH: His name?

00:48:05.488 --> 00:48:06.258
LIAM: Yeah.

00:48:06.258 --> 00:48:06.974
DEBORAH: Sir Cadigan.

00:48:06.974 --> 00:48:09.271
LIAM: Sir Cadigan? That's a good name.

00:48:09.271 --> 00:48:10.536
MARISHA: Was this in Port Damali?

00:48:10.536 --> 00:48:12.215
DEBORAH: This was in Port Damali. You are smart.

00:48:12.215 --> 00:48:16.940
LAURA: Do we know of any museums or places with
magical items in Port Damali?

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:21.394
MATT: Make a history check. Low DC, since you're
relatively local.

00:48:21.394 --> 00:48:24.694
LAURA: Natural 20!

00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:32.114
MATT: There's not so much in the way of museums,
per se, but there are collections. There are

00:48:32.114 --> 00:48:40.942
collectors, and those are usually private and
invite-only through mutual merchants and nobles

00:48:40.942 --> 00:48:48.783
and people of affluent nature. But there are two
auction houses where a lot of these items are sold

00:48:48.783 --> 00:48:59.196
and traded by these collectors. One exists in Port
Damali. It's called the Exalted Collection Auction House.

00:48:59.206 --> 00:49:00.202
SAM: The Exalted Collection.

00:49:00.202 --> 00:49:01.219
LAURA: I don't know how to spell exalted.

00:49:02.129 --> 00:49:04.199
SAM: You can copy off of me.

00:49:04.199 --> 00:49:08.219
LIAM: Well, Twiggy, tell me. This happy fun ball
of yours, what does it do?

00:49:08.219 --> 00:49:10.992
DEBORAH: Well, it makes money, for one.

00:49:10.992 --> 00:49:12.524
LIAM: How much money?

00:49:12.524 --> 00:49:14.564
DEBORAH: Depends where you touch it.

00:49:14.564 --> 00:49:18.987
SAM: She made 15 gold pieces down there out of
nothing.

00:49:18.987 --> 00:49:20.837
LIAM: That's a Frumpkin and a half.

00:49:20.837 --> 00:49:24.727
DEBORAH: This is true. I've heard of these
frumpkins. I'm just kidding; I don't know what

00:49:24.727 --> 00:49:25.340
that is.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.632
LAURA: That's his cat-octopus. Owl, also owl.

00:49:29.632 --> 00:49:35.524
LIAM: Sometimes a spider and other things as well.
This does other things besides making money? What

00:49:35.524 --> 00:49:37.128
else does this do?

00:49:37.128 --> 00:49:41.387
DEBORAH: I've played with it a lot, and all kinds
of little flashes and things go off.

00:49:41.387 --> 00:49:43.056
LIAM: Okay.

00:49:43.056 --> 00:49:48.066
TALIESIN: I'm coming up with a veggie plate, by
the way, the sort of things you're embarrassed

00:49:48.066 --> 00:49:50.327
your parents bring up, and putting it down.

00:49:50.327 --> 00:49:52.817
DEBORAH: Twiggy goes: Yum! And digs right in.

00:49:52.817 --> 00:50:01.647
TALIESIN: Do you have any future plans here? Is
there something that you're moving towards? Do you

00:50:01.647 --> 00:50:04.879
have a place that you're heading, a goal,
anything?

00:50:04.879 --> 00:50:07.343
DEBORAH: I like making friends.

00:50:07.343 --> 00:50:08.620
TALIESIN: That's great.

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:15.288
DEBORAH: I go around looking for friends. I give
my most winningest smile.

00:50:15.288 --> 00:50:17.947
TRAVIS: That is heavily disarming.

00:50:17.947 --> 00:50:25.456
TALIESIN: You're doing great, then. But there's a
direction, a cardinal direction that you're making

00:50:25.456 --> 00:50:27.103
these friends in, or do you--?

00:50:27.103 --> 00:50:29.896
DEBORAH: Things just sort of happen to me.

00:50:29.896 --> 00:50:30.920
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:36.474
DEBORAH: Sometimes I do things, and then I end up
somewhere. I go where the wind blows.

00:50:36.474 --> 00:50:37.266
LIAM: 21.

00:50:37.266 --> 00:50:44.994
MATT: As you're inspecting this, there are
sections of it, Rubik's Cube-esque, where you have

00:50:44.994 --> 00:50:51.608
to rotate an area to allow another part to rotate,
and there's a strange order to these. One, for

00:50:51.608 --> 00:50:57.557
things that should be rotating freely, there's a
consistent resistance to it. You also notice,

00:50:57.557 --> 00:51:03.870
between the seams where all of these pieces of
metal overlap, where there's a slight gap, if you

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:09.816
manage to hold it in shadow or put shadow over it,
there's a very faint blue-green glow that barely

00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:19.473
peeks through each seam from the inside of this
sphere. There definitely is magic. You're a smart

00:51:19.473 --> 00:51:28.258
guy. You're starting to look it over. You're like,
some of these patterns, maybe could figure it out.

00:51:28.258 --> 00:51:34.120
You do notice that a lot of the strange
inscriptions on it appear to be complicated

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:42.922
variations of basic conjuration glyphs. None that
you've seen, but you can see the similar shapes,

00:51:42.922 --> 00:51:46.944
the similar equation-type connection between these
glyphs.

00:51:46.944 --> 00:51:48.743
LIAM: That would explain the money, yeah?

00:51:48.743 --> 00:51:53.646
MATT: There is a strong conjuration element all
across, and very minute, impossibly small

00:51:53.646 --> 00:51:55.953
engraving across the metal.

00:51:55.953 --> 00:52:00.399
LIAM: Can I tell how old this thing looks?

00:52:00.399 --> 00:52:08.357
MATT: No idea. All the metal's pretty well kept.
It's pretty polished. There's a couple of errant

00:52:08.357 --> 00:52:16.260
smears of chocolate caught in some aspects of it,
a few sticky fingerprints in some areas.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.897
TRAVIS: It's like the worst controller you've ever
picked up at your friend's house. You're like, oh.

00:52:20.897 --> 00:52:24.997
Chocolate and Cheetos and all sorts of shit.

00:52:24.997 --> 00:52:29.501
LIAM: Cheeto dust sprinkles out.

00:52:29.501 --> 00:52:33.827
LAURA: Maybe it's like a piggy bank or something.
Maybe it holds a certain amount of coins, and you

00:52:33.827 --> 00:52:36.544
have to turn it the right way. Can you hear coins?

00:52:36.544 --> 00:52:37.868
LIAM: No, I don't hear anything.

00:52:37.868 --> 00:52:40.873
LAURA: Maybe they're really jammed in there good.
Maybe it's because there are so many, they don't

00:52:40.873 --> 00:52:41.664
shake around.

00:52:41.664 --> 00:52:44.516
LIAM: Is it limitless? Does it make money all day
long?

00:52:44.516 --> 00:52:48.175
DEBORAH: Yeah, every time I twist it in that one
way, it'll make money drop.

00:52:48.175 --> 00:52:50.140
LIAM: Can you show me the one way?

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:53.721
LAURA: How much money do you have down in the box?
Because that's a lot of times!

00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:54.651
DEBORAH: Who needs money?

00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:58.280
LIAM: Excuse me, one moment. Twiggy?

00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:58.984
DEBORAH: Yes?

00:52:58.984 --> 00:53:01.182
LIAM: Would you show me how you make money with
it?

00:53:01.182 --> 00:53:06.031
DEBORAH: I take it back, and I sit down, and I
cross my knees. I put it in my lap, and it's like

00:53:06.032 --> 00:53:09.874
this giant beach ball. I do this same movement
where I pull it from the top around so that it

00:53:09.874 --> 00:53:13.827
opens up, and then I can use my thumb. You see my
fingers are actually long and slender and

00:53:13.827 --> 00:53:19.434
perfectly suited for this. It pushes around the
other side, doing the same movement I did before.

00:53:19.434 --> 00:53:25.224
MATT: This time, (puff), you see this flash of
white light, and eight gold coins clank to the

00:53:25.224 --> 00:53:26.333
surface of the ship.

00:53:26.333 --> 00:53:28.015
TALIESIN: Oh, would you look at that.

00:53:28.015 --> 00:53:29.388
LIAM: May I see that one more time?

00:53:29.388 --> 00:53:31.591
DEBORAH: I roll it across the floor to him.
Catch!

00:53:32.288 --> 00:53:35.132
LIAM: From perfect memory, I duplicate what she
just did.

00:53:35.132 --> 00:53:39.991
MATT: Okay, (puff), white flash. Four gold coins.

00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:41.807
LAURA: Oh, it's half every time.

00:53:41.807 --> 00:53:44.151
LIAM: Well, I take them.

00:53:44.151 --> 00:53:46.232
TRAVIS: 15, eight, four.

00:53:46.232 --> 00:53:48.232
DEBORAH: I pick up the eight, and I say: You want
those?

00:53:48.232 --> 00:53:50.034
LAURA: Oh, Nott already took them.

00:53:50.034 --> 00:53:52.481
DEBORAH: The eight that came out when I did it the
first time.

00:53:52.481 --> 00:53:54.230
MATT: Yeah, Nott already took them.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:58.825
DEBORAH: Oh, you already did. Okay, so never mind.
I missed it.

00:53:58.825 --> 00:54:02.242
TALIESIN: You mind if I take a look at that really
quick?

00:54:02.242 --> 00:54:04.759
LIAM: Yeah. I walk it over to him. Here you go.

00:54:04.759 --> 00:54:06.389
TALIESIN: You can roll it. It's all right.

00:54:06.389 --> 00:54:09.336
LIAM: No, I don't think that's a good idea.

00:54:09.336 --> 00:54:12.246
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to move some stuff and
see what happens.

00:54:12.246 --> 00:54:14.626
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

00:54:14.626 --> 00:54:21.505
TALIESIN: Oh, man. Awesome. Oh, no, damn, it was
almost a natural one. I'm so sad. That's a six.

00:54:21.505 --> 00:54:33.997
MATT: Okay. You find one section that shifts,
following suit with her, and it sticks. Yeah,

00:54:33.997 --> 00:54:35.351
you're not getting anywhere.

00:54:35.351 --> 00:54:36.516
DEBORAH: It's hard.

00:54:36.516 --> 00:54:41.043
TALIESIN: Huh. That's really cool, though. I
imagine doing that all day. That'd be great. Yeah,

00:54:41.043 --> 00:54:43.613
I can imagine doing that all day.

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:47.336
DEBORAH: Welcome to my world.

00:54:47.336 --> 00:54:52.036
TALIESIN: Wow. Rolls really well, too. I'm sorry,
I don't actually even remember why I asked for it.

00:54:52.036 --> 00:54:54.584
DEBORAH: I pick it up and do that basketball
thing.

00:54:54.584 --> 00:54:56.692
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fancy.

00:54:56.692 --> 00:55:01.365
LIAM: What are we going to do with this little kid
and/or old lady?

00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:07.276
TRAVIS: Well, I think we'll take her to the island
and then, obviously, give her a chance to continue

00:55:07.276 --> 00:55:09.448
her adventure.

00:55:09.448 --> 00:55:12.000
LAURA: She can stay with us forever.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:20.714
TRAVIS: Well, now, Jester, look, I loved Kiri as
much as the next person. So much, just, mm.

00:55:20.714 --> 00:55:22.436
LAURA: Yeah, Kiri's wonderful.

00:55:22.436 --> 00:55:27.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, so great. But I also don't want to
be responsible for anyone that can't take care of themselves.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:31.207
LAURA: You can take care of yourself. She made a
hand. Can you do cool things?

00:55:31.207 --> 00:55:32.942
TRAVIS: She made a what?

00:55:32.942 --> 00:55:35.576
MARISHA: Yeah, it was super freaky, actually.

00:55:35.576 --> 00:55:39.302
TRAVIS: Are we forgetting to describe things that
are of import on this ship? She did what?

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:40.927
SAM: She has a bit of magic.

00:55:40.927 --> 00:55:48.163
DEBORAH: At this point, I walk up to you and I
say-- oh, no, I walk up to you. I say: How many

00:55:48.163 --> 00:55:50.707
tickles does it take to make an octopus laugh?

00:55:50.707 --> 00:55:53.555
LIAM: Oh no, don't you dare.

00:55:53.555 --> 00:55:57.313
DEBORAH: Ten tickles! And I cast Hideous Laughter.

00:55:57.313 --> 00:56:00.260
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:05.486
LIAM: It's an 18.

00:56:05.486 --> 00:56:08.354
DEBORAH: So it doesn't work, but I go: Funny, huh?

00:56:08.354 --> 00:56:10.462
LIAM: Yeah, I'm not a happy guy.

00:56:10.462 --> 00:56:14.994
TRAVIS: I wanted to see a Caleb laugh so bad.

00:56:14.994 --> 00:56:16.766
MATT: I know!

00:56:16.766 --> 00:56:19.351
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Like some horrible crash.

00:56:19.351 --> 00:56:21.930
DEBORAH: It's an octopus joke!

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:26.376
LIAM: (awkward, forced laughter)

00:56:26.376 --> 00:56:29.634
TRAVIS: Okay, so she's not entirely invalid.

00:56:29.634 --> 00:56:32.598
LAURA: Fjord, what are you doing?

00:56:32.598 --> 00:56:33.565
TRAVIS: What?

00:56:33.565 --> 00:56:37.525
SAM: He's assessing his new crew. This is what a
professional captain does.

00:56:37.525 --> 00:56:42.676
TRAVIS: That's right. Jester, you would not want
guilt over bringing in sweet Twiggy here to what

00:56:42.676 --> 00:56:46.496
could be certain doom. That's what we do; we seek
out certain doom.

00:56:46.496 --> 00:56:46.746
DEBORAH: Sounds fun!

00:56:46.746 --> 00:56:49.299
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:56:49.299 --> 00:56:53.931
SAM: Just to allay some of our fears, were people
actively pursuing you and chasing you when you got

00:56:53.931 --> 00:56:58.256
onto this boat? And if so, how many?

00:56:58.256 --> 00:56:59.800
TRAVIS: Tell the truth, now.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.712
DEBORAH: Oh, I always tell the truth. Mom and Dad
said, very important to always tell the truth.

00:57:03.712 --> 00:57:05.046
SAM: May they rest in peace.

00:57:05.046 --> 00:57:14.491
DEBORAH: Thank you. To be perfectly honest, yes.
There were quite a few people chasing me. But I'm

00:57:14.491 --> 00:57:18.407
super fast. Not really, I'm just really sneaky.

00:57:18.407 --> 00:57:22.854
SAM: Do you think they might still be chasing or
tracking you or wanting to find you?

00:57:22.854 --> 00:57:25.151
DEBORAH: Hadn't really thought about it.

00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:26.917
SAM: Ooh. That's not great.

00:57:26.917 --> 00:57:32.118
TRAVIS: Well, you said you got that nice little
sphere there; anything else we should know about, maybe?

00:57:32.118 --> 00:57:33.799
DEBORAH: Fun ball of tricks!

00:57:33.799 --> 00:57:40.815
TRAVIS: Fun ball of tricks, yes. I will not forget
again. Anything else we should know about that

00:57:40.815 --> 00:57:43.502
people might wish they had instead of you?

00:57:43.502 --> 00:57:50.695
DEBORAH: That's all I've got right now, but I do
have sticky fingers. I hold them up, and they're

00:57:50.695 --> 00:57:51.893
covered in chocolate.

00:57:51.893 --> 00:57:54.407
MATT: Who's got the sphere?

00:57:54.407 --> 00:57:57.233
TRAVIS: Caduceus had it last.

00:57:57.233 --> 00:57:59.463
DEBORAH: He's had it. We've been playing, and I
twirled--

00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:01.304
TALIESIN: There was a twirl, and it went back.

00:58:01.304 --> 00:58:05.323
LIAM: Do you have any prospects? Any long-term
plans, goals? Where do you see yourself in a year,

00:58:05.323 --> 00:58:07.189
let alone a week from now?

00:58:07.189 --> 00:58:09.555
DEBORAH: Hanging out with you guys!

00:58:09.555 --> 00:58:13.259
LAURA: Yes! Best answer ever!

00:58:13.259 --> 00:58:14.150
TRAVIS: Oh, great.

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:15.591
LIAM: What about Kiri?

00:58:15.591 --> 00:58:17.243
LAURA: What about Kiri?

00:58:17.243 --> 00:58:19.205
LIAM: What about Nott?

00:58:19.205 --> 00:58:23.805
LAURA: What about Nott? We're all friends. What
about Cali? We all love each other so much.

00:58:23.805 --> 00:58:26.933
MARISHA: I'm a little confused at your implication
as well.

00:58:26.933 --> 00:58:30.245
TALIESIN: I'm going to Detect Magic to get a--

00:58:30.245 --> 00:58:31.033
DEBORAH: On me?

00:58:31.033 --> 00:58:31.769
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:58:31.769 --> 00:58:33.791
DEBORAH: Detect Magic!

00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:37.153
MATT: There is a powerful magical essence
emanating from that sphere.

00:58:37.153 --> 00:58:42.143
TALIESIN: Okay. No one's got anything sitting on
her?

00:58:42.143 --> 00:58:49.923
MATT: A different kind of magic, but comparable to
the dodecahedron in some ways.

00:58:49.923 --> 00:58:53.914
TALIESIN: Okay. Same vibe.

00:58:53.914 --> 00:59:00.112
MATT: Yeah, and there is two faint magical auras
on her person.

00:59:00.112 --> 00:59:06.254
SAM: (whispering) She's holding!

00:59:06.254 --> 00:59:09.026
DEBORAH: Would he know? Could he be able to tell?

00:59:09.026 --> 00:59:13.574
MATT: He would be able to tell if there was
something magical on your person. He wouldn't know

00:59:13.574 --> 00:59:16.500
any more than that.

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.109
SAM: Caleb would know.

00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:22.252
TRAVIS: Jester, I'm going to leave you in charge
of Twiggy, all right? We've got to make for this

00:59:22.252 --> 00:59:27.270
island. You keep an eye on her. I don't want to
see any chocolate thumbprints in my quarters, you

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:29.280
understand, Twiggy?

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.358
DEBORAH: Done.

00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:31.590
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:34.424
TALIESIN: Those were all over it, then.

00:59:34.424 --> 00:59:38.482
TRAVIS: All right, you're in charge.

00:59:38.482 --> 00:59:40.685
LAURA: Hey, don't steal from us, okay?

00:59:40.685 --> 00:59:41.580
DEBORAH: Nope!

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.199
LAURA: Good. See, we're good!

00:59:44.199 --> 00:59:48.830
MARISHA: As Fjord gets the boat going, I follow
after Fjord.

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:54.464
SAM: I'm going to, seeing as how she said there
are folks chasing her, as we get going again, go

00:59:54.464 --> 00:59:59.392
up to the crow's nest, and do a scan with my
awesome perception, and see if there's any boats

00:59:59.392 --> 01:00:01.155
trailing us.

01:00:01.155 --> 01:00:04.906
MATT: Make a perception check as you clamber up to
the top of the crow's nest and glance over the horizon.

01:00:04.906 --> 01:00:05.813
SAM: 11.

01:00:05.813 --> 01:00:11.214
MATT: Looking off in the horizon, you currently
don't see any ships that are immediately pushing

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:15.356
into the territory. You're following Fjord.

01:00:15.356 --> 01:00:22.492
MARISHA: Do you need help getting the boat-- ship
sailing? Ship moving? Whatever.

01:00:22.492 --> 01:00:25.374
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course. Feel free to lend a
hand.

01:00:25.374 --> 01:00:31.584
MARISHA: Am I the only one that's not beguiled by
her charms? Twiggy?

01:00:31.584 --> 01:00:34.349
TRAVIS: No, you're not the only one. I don't trust
that shit.

01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:36.804
MARISHA: Me neither. Anything that cute--

01:00:36.804 --> 01:00:40.301
TRAVIS: That saccharine? Yeah, you need some salt
to balance that shit out.

01:00:40.301 --> 01:00:43.989
MARISHA: Have you ever noticed that pomeranians
are the nastiest dogs you've ever met?

01:00:43.989 --> 01:00:45.249
TRAVIS: What's a pomeranian?

01:00:45.249 --> 01:00:49.598
MARISHA: They're poofy. They're super adorable.
They'll eat your face.

01:00:49.598 --> 01:00:54.105
SAM: I run over to them and say: Oh, Twiggy just
did this thing with her tongue where she made it

01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:57.677
into a circle. It was really great; you've got to
see it later!

01:00:57.677 --> 01:01:01.391
DEBORAH: Not everyone can do it!

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:04.756
SAM: It's really cool.

01:01:04.756 --> 01:01:06.852
TRAVIS: Maybe we throw her overboard.

01:01:06.852 --> 01:01:12.937
MARISHA: That's a solid option. Like a Plan D.

01:01:12.937 --> 01:01:16.598
TRAVIS: When you were down there with her, did she
try any shady shit?

01:01:16.598 --> 01:01:21.811
MARISHA: She definitely has some magic
capabilities. She cast this illusion that made her

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:27.934
hand look like it was extending. I think it was
supposed to be cute, but you know that uncanny

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:31.502
valley? It was a little weird. It's unsettling.

01:01:31.502 --> 01:01:33.840
TRAVIS: Right. Okay.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.478
MARISHA: Hey, I have another question.

01:01:36.478 --> 01:01:37.232
TRAVIS: Yes?

01:01:37.232 --> 01:01:41.725
MARISHA: Since you're captain now, right? You're
captain?

01:01:41.725 --> 01:01:43.038
TRAVIS: Apparently.

01:01:43.038 --> 01:01:45.156
MARISHA: Will you train me to be your first mate?

01:01:48.396 --> 01:01:50.403
TRAVIS: Yes. Yes, I will.

01:01:50.828 --> 01:01:52.112
MARISHA: Really? Okay.

01:01:52.112 --> 01:01:57.076
TRAVIS: Are you up for it? Lot of responsibility.
You've got to, like, co-sign for the boat and shit.

01:01:57.076 --> 01:01:59.601
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:01.822
TRAVIS: Shake on it?

01:02:01.822 --> 01:02:03.084
MARISHA: Deal.

01:02:03.084 --> 01:02:04.765
TRAVIS: All right, first mate.

01:02:04.765 --> 01:02:08.240
MATT: It stings you a little bit. Your wound's
still fresh.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.912
TRAVIS: Ah! Fucking Cobalt grip.

01:02:10.912 --> 01:02:15.418
MARISHA: Sorry again for being a dick. I think
I've been a little bit on edge with the boat.

01:02:15.418 --> 01:02:17.791
TRAVIS: It's all right, I'm kind of immune now. I
just take it.

01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:23.190
MARISHA: It's really just a knee-jerk, it would've
happened if it was anybody. You could've been a

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:25.749
scarecrow, and I would've been like, "Fuck off,
bro!"

01:02:25.749 --> 01:02:27.813
TRAVIS: I feel so special.

01:02:27.813 --> 01:02:30.126
MARISHA: Okay, let's go.

01:02:30.126 --> 01:02:37.971
MATT: You do also know, as you're heading into
legal territory under the Clovis Concord, that you

01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:41.181
have a ship that is known and labelled as the
Squalleater, as damaged as it is.

01:02:41.181 --> 01:02:42.594
LAURA: Oh no!

01:02:42.594 --> 01:02:44.475
SAM: Change the name!

01:02:44.475 --> 01:02:48.910
TRAVIS: (burbling) That's my call. (burbling)
Forward deck.

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:54.013
SAM: The Squallbeater. The Balleater!

01:02:54.013 --> 01:02:56.553
LAURA: The Balleater!

01:02:56.553 --> 01:03:00.713
TRAVIS: We need to change it to the Balleater as
quickly as possible. Nott, I need you to hang over

01:03:00.713 --> 01:03:02.855
the side of the ship with a paintbrush--

01:03:02.855 --> 01:03:04.955
LIAM: That's going to draw attention to us.

01:03:04.955 --> 01:03:09.594
TRAVIS: -- inches above the water and change the
name of the ship to the Balleater.

01:03:09.594 --> 01:03:13.892
MARISHA: It actually works pretty easily! You just
add a line, and then you paint over that.

01:03:13.892 --> 01:03:15.508
TRAVIS: Can you do it?

01:03:15.508 --> 01:03:23.721
DEBORAH: I say: Don't worry about it! Don't worry!
Again, this hand comes off of my own hand. I flick

01:03:23.721 --> 01:03:28.790
it, and it flies off and it comes and picks up the
paintbrush. I lean over the side, and it goes down

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:32.559
and starts to change your title for you, without
having to risk his life.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.877
LAURA: Wow. She can paint, too.

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:38.535
MATT: Roll a dexterity check for me.

01:03:38.535 --> 01:03:43.064
SAM: I never remember to use it like that.

01:03:43.064 --> 01:03:47.068
MATT: This is dexterity, to see how well you can
paint it while upside down.

01:03:47.068 --> 01:03:48.961
DEBORAH: Natural 20.

01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:51.538
TALIESIN: This is apparently a Mary Poppins
musical act.

01:03:51.538 --> 01:03:59.987
MATT: Apparently! Not only does she manage to
entirely erase the beginning of the word "Squall,"

01:03:59.987 --> 01:04:10.077
but has beautifully calligraphied the B of "Ball"
to where it looks almost like a set of balls, if

01:04:10.077 --> 01:04:17.596
interpreted that way. It has this nice sparkly
border around it now. It's like (singing)

01:04:17.596 --> 01:04:19.928
Balleater! It's almost got jazz hands.

01:04:19.928 --> 01:04:21.579
DEBORAH: Shadowed and decor.

01:04:21.579 --> 01:04:23.371
MARISHA: I agree with Caduceus.

01:04:23.371 --> 01:04:25.182
TALIESIN: Calligraphy's very impressive.

01:04:25.182 --> 01:04:27.128
LIAM: Is this regular paint or the magic paint?

01:04:27.128 --> 01:04:28.428
MATT: This is regular paint.

01:04:28.428 --> 01:04:29.668
LIAM: That's good!

01:04:29.668 --> 01:04:31.947
LAURA: As a side note, I am hiding my magic paint
like whoa.

01:04:31.947 --> 01:04:33.129
MATT: Good to know.

01:04:33.129 --> 01:04:37.790
DEBORAH: It comes back up and it paints a mustache
on me, and I go: Arr!

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:38.849
TRAVIS: On who?

01:04:38.849 --> 01:04:40.399
DEBORAH: On me!

01:04:40.399 --> 01:04:43.506
TRAVIS: I thought it was on me! I was like,
(yelps).

01:04:43.506 --> 01:04:46.654
SAM: Wow, that was very impressive!

01:04:46.654 --> 01:04:48.804
LAURA: That's really good. That's really, really
good.

01:04:48.804 --> 01:04:51.107
SAM: You've made some allies today with that.

01:04:51.107 --> 01:04:53.002
TRAVIS: You're a temporary pirate now.

01:04:53.002 --> 01:04:56.545
DEBORAH: (gasping) My eyes get even bigger.

01:04:56.545 --> 01:04:59.692
TRAVIS: It's a great honor; don't mess it up. What
were you saying?

01:04:59.692 --> 01:05:01.262
LAURA: We should take the sail down.

01:05:01.262 --> 01:05:03.997
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say we probably took
stock of any colors we have that we can run up

01:05:03.997 --> 01:05:06.216
that aren't associated with the Squalleater.

01:05:06.216 --> 01:05:09.015
MATT: There are no colors on deck that aren't
associated with it. The only colors that are on

01:05:09.015 --> 01:05:13.570
deck were the colors that the ship previously
sailed.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:18.411
TRAVIS: We still have some fire damage on the
boat, though? We're going to play that. Our flag

01:05:18.411 --> 01:05:19.519
was burned.

01:05:19.519 --> 01:05:24.275
LAURA: Our flag was burned by pirates.

01:05:24.275 --> 01:05:27.708
SAM: We could paint a new flag with your brush.

01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:31.759
LAURA: Yeah, but that's a really big amount of
paint to use for a flag.

01:05:31.759 --> 01:05:33.902
MATT: Make a history check, Caleb.

01:05:33.902 --> 01:05:36.397
SAM: Okay. Are you ever going to use that paint?

01:05:36.397 --> 01:05:37.689
LAURA: Yes, I am.

01:05:37.689 --> 01:05:38.250
LIAM: 21.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:52.341
MATT: You keep thinking on that sphere. You've
read about similar objects, especially the

01:05:52.341 --> 01:06:00.848
conjuration aspect of it, that are used as
focuses, similar to a bag of holding, to maintain

01:06:00.848 --> 01:06:08.502
and contain things for powerful mages. Its
construction makes you feel like it's very old.

01:06:08.502 --> 01:06:13.841
Probably pre-Calamity.

01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:17.692
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of here. What? That's so
old.

01:06:17.692 --> 01:06:22.134
MATT: Pre-Calamity is 800 years, and there's a
whole era of very powerful magic--

01:06:22.134 --> 01:06:24.204
TRAVIS: Is it only 800? I thought it was 8,000.

01:06:24.204 --> 01:06:27.941
MATT: No, 800 years ago was the Calamity. Or a
little over 800.

01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:38.332
TALIESIN: Caleb, just a second? Just thought you
should know there's a couple interesting magical

01:06:38.332 --> 01:06:46.289
auras on our new friend. I thought it would be
impolite to point it out or to dispel anything. I

01:06:46.289 --> 01:06:52.156
try and respect people's personal intentions, but
if you feel the urge to do a little Identify at

01:06:52.156 --> 01:06:58.379
some point, that may not be a bad idea. I don't
know. Just to make sure that everything that's

01:06:58.379 --> 01:07:02.740
there is meant to be there.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.571
LIAM: Noted.

01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:11.307
TALIESIN: I'm not getting a bad vibe off of this
one, just a lot of sugar. Being held up for a

01:07:11.307 --> 01:07:16.253
while in a dark, confined space can make people a
little loopy.

01:07:16.253 --> 01:07:23.079
LIAM: I am also worried about traveling around--
Well, I am not a fan of the name Balleater for

01:07:23.079 --> 01:07:24.593
this boat.

01:07:24.593 --> 01:07:29.499
TALIESIN: No, I also agree. I think it draws an
unfortunate amount of attention.

01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:35.604
(laughter)

01:07:35.604 --> 01:07:40.762
LIAM: On a similar note, I feel like our new
miniature friend will also draw attention.

01:07:40.762 --> 01:07:44.714
TALIESIN: That's fair. That's a very fair point.

01:07:44.714 --> 01:07:51.485
LIAM: Maybe I'll have a chat with her, get us on
the same page.

01:07:51.485 --> 01:08:00.644
TALIESIN: I don't know if she's necessarily going
to listen to you. She's a little--

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:03.650
LIAM: Sometimes people listen to me.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:14.121
TALIESIN: That's very true. You do have an air of
authority. You do! Right now, I'm feeling really

01:08:14.121 --> 01:08:18.989
awkward about this whole conversation purely from
your face. Your face has done nothing, and now I'm just--

01:08:18.989 --> 01:08:23.472
LIAM: Well, it takes two to tango. My palms are
sweating at the moment.

01:08:23.472 --> 01:08:28.109
TALIESIN: That weirdly makes me feel better. I'll
disengage straight up, then.

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:29.991
LIAM: I am going to find our little friend.

01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:32.322
TALIESIN: That's fine. I'm going to go over and
cook something.

01:08:32.322 --> 01:08:35.440
LAURA: Do you want to say we're up in the crow's
nest? Is that a good place to be? Or would you

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.342
like to be somewhere else? I know you've been
below deck for a very long time.

01:08:39.342 --> 01:08:45.879
DEBORAH: I've climbed up on those things, and I'm
swinging back and forth on the ropes and the hooks

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:50.729
on the main mast, wind in my hair.

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:55.857
MATT: As this is happening and you're approaching,
Caleb, you see Orly sitting there with his giant

01:08:55.857 --> 01:09:02.768
tortle arms looking up with his craned tortle
neck, and going, "Hmm."

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:05.492
LIAM: How long has she been doing that for?

01:09:05.492 --> 01:09:07.735
MATT: "Far too long."

01:09:10.232 --> 01:09:15.134
LAURA: I'm in the crow's nest going: Twiggy?
Twiggy, seriously, come back to the crow's nest, though!

01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:17.510
DEBORAH: Five more minutes!

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:20.466
TRAVIS: Oh no!

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:30.529
LIAM: Bitte, a moment of your time, just to have
a chat. You can keep swinging, but could you swing

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:32.652
a little lower?

01:09:32.652 --> 01:09:39.420
DEBORAH: I jump. It's really light and beautiful,
almost like I couldn't fall at all. You see me

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:45.824
grabbing on the hooks like a little monkey. I fly
down the mast and jump down so I can sit right

01:09:45.824 --> 01:09:47.122
next to you.

01:09:47.122 --> 01:09:49.498
LIAM: All of that movement is making me nervous.

01:09:49.498 --> 01:09:51.061
DEBORAH: Don't be nervous!

01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:53.964
LIAM: Welcome to The Mighty Nein.

01:09:56.107 --> 01:09:59.874
DEBORAH: (counting) That's weird!

01:09:59.874 --> 01:10:03.472
LIAM: It's sort of a running gag, but it's our
name.

01:10:03.472 --> 01:10:05.023
DEBORAH: I love gags!

01:10:05.023 --> 01:10:09.496
LIAM: You know, if you're going to be traveling
with us for a while, I have a few suggestions.

01:10:09.496 --> 01:10:11.449
DEBORAH: Okay.

01:10:11.449 --> 01:10:16.719
LIAM: So three. The first of them is probably when
we get to land, it will be better if you kept a

01:10:16.719 --> 01:10:27.682
low profile because we sometimes cut a rough
swathe wherever we go and I can't guarantee that

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:36.096
someone is not familiar with us. So I would hate for any danger to, you know-- best not to call attention.

01:10:36.096 --> 01:10:38.702
DEBORAH: No more friends. Don't make any more
friends.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.105
LIAM: Well, just stick with us for a little while,
and see how that works out.

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:43.963
DEBORAH: I love that idea.

01:10:43.963 --> 01:10:50.125
LIAM: Okay. The second suggestion is that you
should meet my cat, Frumpkin.

01:10:50.409 --> 01:10:53.895
DEBORAH: I put my hand over Trixie, in my pocket.

01:10:53.895 --> 01:10:55.441
LIAM: What's the matter?

01:10:55.441 --> 01:10:57.570
DEBORAH: Does your cat like squirrels?

01:10:57.570 --> 01:11:02.320
LIAM: Oh, my cat is very well trained and will not
hurt your squirrel. I promise.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:09.155
DEBORAH: So is Trixie. (as Trixie) Yeah, I'm real
good. (as Twiggy) Sorry. It's me saying it!

01:11:09.155 --> 01:11:13.258
It's not Trixie, it's me saying it. (as Trixie)
I'm crate trained!

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:24.204
LIAM: I scarcely know what to do with you. We'll
get to the cat in a minute. I will so gladly

01:11:24.204 --> 01:11:29.495
introduce you to my cat because I'm very fond of
him and love for people to meet him. But before we

01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:38.801
do that, the third suggestion is-- and I cast
Suggestion-- I suggest you share any strange or

01:11:38.801 --> 01:11:47.194
unique or arcane objects or things even that are
of threat with me just so I know that we are safe.

01:11:47.194 --> 01:11:49.353
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:11:50.277 --> 01:11:52.904
DEBORAH: I have advantage on this.

01:11:54.095 --> 01:11:55.651
LIAM: That's rough.

01:11:55.651 --> 01:11:56.754
DEBORAH: 14.

01:11:56.754 --> 01:11:57.824
LIAM: 16.

01:11:57.824 --> 01:11:59.186
MATT: So yeah, it takes effect.

01:11:59.186 --> 01:12:03.890
DEBORAH: No worries. I scramble up to you and I
try to sit in your lap.

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:06.691
LIAM: Oh, how about you just sit next to me?

01:12:06.691 --> 01:12:12.920
DEBORAH: I lean my head on your shoulder, and I
say: Okay, so I have this little pouch. Out of my

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:20.077
bag, again there's feathers and fleece and all
this sand and stuff I'm pulling out. I pull out a

01:12:20.077 --> 01:12:24.767
little cube and say: This is my achoo dust.

01:12:24.767 --> 01:12:27.513
LIAM: Oh, put that back in your pocket.

01:12:27.513 --> 01:12:30.951
DEBORAH: It goes back in my pocket, and then I go:
You want to see something cool?

01:12:30.951 --> 01:12:32.454
LIAM: Always.

01:12:32.454 --> 01:12:36.432
DEBORAH: I go and lift up my cloak and put it over
my head. As I do that, another little Twiggy shows

01:12:36.432 --> 01:12:42.710
up right next to me, and when I move she moves. I
go: Look! And we do a little dance for you.

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:44.858
LIAM: I put one of my hands through their heads.

01:12:44.858 --> 01:12:47.458
DEBORAH: One of them, yes, it's an illusion.

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:49.275
LIAM: Oh, that's good.

01:12:49.275 --> 01:12:52.229
DEBORAH: Yeah, people have a real hard time
getting me.

01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:54.057
LIAM: Yeah, I'm not going to try to do that.

01:12:54.057 --> 01:12:55.101
DEBORAH: Yay!

01:12:55.101 --> 01:12:56.549
LIAM: Is there anything--

01:12:56.549 --> 01:12:58.549
LAURA: I'm watching from the crow's nest.

01:12:58.549 --> 01:13:01.589
MATT: Every time she goes into that pouch and
opens it up, you can still see taking up a large

01:13:01.589 --> 01:13:09.730
portion of it, massively, like a distended
backpack, is the slightly shifting clockwork of

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:11.271
that sphere.

01:13:12.414 --> 01:13:15.207
DEBORAH: I take my hood off and go: Neat, huh?

01:13:15.707 --> 01:13:20.704
LIAM: Yeah, the neatest. Do you have anything that
is harmful or is it just those two things

01:13:20.704 --> 01:13:23.223
including your puzzle ball?

01:13:23.223 --> 01:13:26.793
DEBORAH: I say: Well, these can do some damage.

01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:29.046
TRAVIS: Your hands?

01:13:29.795 --> 01:13:32.100
LIAM: Yeah, okay, well--

01:13:32.928 --> 01:13:35.904
MARISHA: These are registered deadly weapons.

01:13:36.368 --> 01:13:38.297
DEBORAH: Don't mess with me!

01:13:38.297 --> 01:13:45.482
LIAM: For what it's worth, I apologize, and here's
my cat. I turn Frumpkin the first night on this

01:13:45.482 --> 01:13:51.269
boat into a cat and use the last of my supplies,
so it's Frumpkin the cat right now. That's Frumpkin.

01:13:51.269 --> 01:13:52.255
DEBORAH: That's Frumpkin.

01:13:52.255 --> 01:13:53.288
LIAM: He is best cat.

01:13:53.288 --> 01:13:54.168
DEBORAH: Can I pet?

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:55.663
LIAM: Of course. He's already climbing up her
shoulder.

01:13:55.663 --> 01:14:02.599
DEBORAH: I pet him and it's like: Ooh, I love your
cat! Ooh, that tickles!

01:14:02.599 --> 01:14:11.460
LIAM: I tell him to do a blep. So he just does
this--

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:14.613
DEBORAH: And Twiggy goes-- back.

01:14:14.613 --> 01:14:21.345
LIAM: All right, you're okay. You can hang out
with Frumpkin for an hour.

01:14:21.345 --> 01:14:24.510
(laughter)

01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:31.981
DEBORAH: Goody! I sit on the floor and Frumpkin
and I start booping each other on the nose.

01:14:31.981 --> 01:14:36.844
LIAM: I go and sit like 20 feet away and watch to
make sure everything is on the up and up.

01:14:36.844 --> 01:14:38.607
DEBORAH: And that's eight hours on Suggestion?

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:39.291
LIAM: Yeah.

01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:40.260
DEBORAH: Okay.

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:44.826
MATT: Well, until the directed activity is
completed.

01:14:44.826 --> 01:14:48.116
LIAM: Well, if she's shown me everything of arcane
nature.

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:51.034
DEBORAH: I've shown you all the magic stuff on my
person.

01:14:51.034 --> 01:14:53.340
MATT: Then yeah, so Suggestion has worn off.

01:14:53.340 --> 01:15:01.921
DEBORAH: I go: Pftt, I know that trick. I give you
a high five. Down below.

01:15:01.921 --> 01:15:04.411
(laughter)

01:15:04.411 --> 01:15:06.938
MATT: Most awkward on-ship high five ever.

01:15:06.938 --> 01:15:12.483
LIAM: We're going to force perspective this shit.
(as Gandalf) Hello, Twiggy.

01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:20.416
MATT: As your new compatriot for this journey
seems to have, for the time being, accepted into

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:23.469
your wings, is there anything else you want to
do?

01:15:23.469 --> 01:15:27.866
TRAVIS: I'll be showing Beau the ropes,
first-manning the ship.

01:15:27.866 --> 01:15:30.039
MATT: All right, so you're getting that situated.

01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:35.111
TALIESIN: I'll be finishing up some stuff in the
kitchen. I'm going to run by Caleb one more time

01:15:35.111 --> 01:15:44.605
to have a chat about what he saw. Just mention,
we've got two magical spheres on board. The one's

01:15:44.605 --> 01:15:46.792
like a clock thing--

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:47.890
LIAM: Maybe three.

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:49.324
TALIESIN: Technically three.

01:15:49.324 --> 01:15:51.927
LIAM: One is in Fjord's gooch.

01:15:54.797 --> 01:16:01.601
TALIESIN: I was thinking it's like a clock. Maybe
that means time-- I don't know if time's passing,

01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:02.728
or something.

01:16:02.728 --> 01:16:09.185
LIAM: Oh, I'm very curious about it. I would like
very much to see if she's willing to sell it or

01:16:09.185 --> 01:16:10.959
part with it somehow.

01:16:10.959 --> 01:16:17.107
TALIESIN: Or at least let you take a look at it
for a while or something. Maybe, I don't know. It

01:16:17.107 --> 01:16:20.028
gives me a chill. Not sure.

01:16:20.028 --> 01:16:24.863
LIAM: I was not paying attention. Has anyone said
how long it is until we reach land?

01:16:24.863 --> 01:16:27.565
TALIESIN and LIAM: Three days.

01:16:27.565 --> 01:16:30.261
MATT: From this point, a little over three days.

01:16:30.261 --> 01:16:32.930
LIAM: Maybe she'll lend it to me.

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:38.840
LAURA: I'm going to teach Twiggy all about The
Traveler. He's pretty cool.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.115
DEBORAH: Cool.

01:16:41.115 --> 01:16:50.940
MATT: So The Traveler, she explains to you in a
very truncated way, is the being that she worships

01:16:50.940 --> 01:17:00.461
but talks with and taught her a bunch of things
and they've been a friend. Anything else you want--

01:17:00.461 --> 01:17:04.963
LAURA: I feel like he would like you a lot, you
know, because number one, he likes people that can

01:17:04.963 --> 01:17:07.785
be sneaky because it's fun, right? And you can be
sneaky.

01:17:07.785 --> 01:17:08.974
DEBORAH: It's the most fun ever!

01:17:08.974 --> 01:17:14.973
LAURA: Also, he has a cloak, just like you have a
cloak. Really cool. Also, he always kept me

01:17:14.973 --> 01:17:20.575
company. I know you had a lot of time by yourself,
right? So did I, and he always kept me company.

01:17:20.575 --> 01:17:22.226
DEBORAH: Is he like (as Trixie) Trixie?

01:17:22.226 --> 01:17:24.862
LAURA: (as Trixie) He's not quite like Trixie.
He's more like (high-pitched) The Traveler!

01:17:24.862 --> 01:17:25.839
DEBORAH: The Traveler!

01:17:25.839 --> 01:17:26.737
LAURA: And he comes and he's over here!

01:17:26.737 --> 01:17:27.325
DEBORAH: Oh, that's cool!

01:17:27.325 --> 01:17:29.996
LAURA: But you can talk to him. You could try any
time. He's around, you know.

01:17:29.996 --> 01:17:34.545
DEBORAH: Hello, Traveler! I don't hear anything.

01:17:34.545 --> 01:17:44.127
LAURA: Well, hold on! Give him a minute! Traveler,
come on, I'm trying to bring somebody to you right now!

01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:46.974
DEBORAH: I'm trying! Maybe he doesn't like me.

01:17:46.974 --> 01:17:48.413
LAURA: No, he likes you a lot, I can tell.

01:17:48.413 --> 01:17:48.988
DEBORAH: Okay.

01:17:48.988 --> 01:17:53.792
LAURA: Yeah. Don't worry. He'll make himself known
to you.

01:17:53.792 --> 01:17:54.418
DEBORAH: Yay!

01:17:54.418 --> 01:17:57.005
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:17:57.005 --> 01:18:06.291
SAM: You had mentioned briefly that some of
Avantika's men and helpers had been armed with

01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:13.611
firearms. If I scout around, is there any ammo
aboard this ship?

01:18:13.611 --> 01:18:15.277
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:18:15.277 --> 01:18:19.376
TRAVIS: Shit, I totally fucking forgot about that.
The first time we got on the boat.

01:18:19.376 --> 01:18:26.112
SAM: 29! Wait. 28.

01:18:27.585 --> 01:18:32.928
MATT: Doing a thorough pass on the crew's
quarters, the remnant of the crew that now is

01:18:32.928 --> 01:18:44.112
arrested or worse on the island of Darktow, yes.
You manage to scavenge up two boxes of firearm ammunition.

01:18:44.112 --> 01:18:46.163
SAM: Any that fit the gun that I have?

01:18:46.163 --> 01:18:47.859
MATT: Yes, actually.

01:18:47.859 --> 01:18:50.669
SAM: I stole a gun a while ago.

01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:52.718
MATT: Yeah, from Hupperdook, I think it was,
right?

01:18:52.718 --> 01:18:53.788
TRAVIS: I don't think we were here.

01:18:53.788 --> 01:18:55.872
SAM: Oh, you might have been--

01:18:55.872 --> 01:18:57.847
LAURA: No, we were around for it.

01:18:57.847 --> 01:19:01.818
MATT: You manage to pull together 22 shots.

01:19:01.818 --> 01:19:04.467
SAM: That fit my piece?

01:19:04.467 --> 01:19:10.020
MATT: That fit yours. There are a few others that
don't quite. They're made for a larger rifle-type,

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:13.215
but these particular iron balls will fit yours.

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:14.855
SAM: Like that?

01:19:14.855 --> 01:19:17.290
TRAVIS: No. That's a kill shot.

01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:19.424
SAM: Cool. Thanks.

01:19:19.424 --> 01:19:25.929
MARISHA: Actually, going off of that, because I
meant to do this last episode, did Avantika have

01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:27.927
anything fabulous in her wardrobe?

01:19:27.927 --> 01:19:28.894
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right!

01:19:28.894 --> 01:19:31.165
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we were opening her
closet.

01:19:31.165 --> 01:19:32.223
MARISHA: We were opening it up.

01:19:32.223 --> 01:19:38.969
MATT: Oh yeah. There are plenty of coats, hats,
scarves, all kinds of things. Most of them in a

01:19:38.969 --> 01:19:45.540
similar vein to what you see her wearing. Most of
them are long coats with the sleeves removed, a

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:52.283
high collar. Big, billowing scarves and cravats
that are varying degrees of well kept. A lot of

01:19:52.283 --> 01:19:57.830
these she's had for a long time and, as such, at
sea, there's weathering. Some of them have grown

01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:01.545
damp and have a little mildew at the very edges
but have been scraped off multiple times, which

01:20:01.545 --> 01:20:04.279
give it a cool look, but maybe a little bit of a
musty smell.

01:20:04.279 --> 01:20:06.232
LAURA: Mending!

01:20:06.232 --> 01:20:13.926
MATT: There's a number of interesting outfits of a
dead woman that you manage to scavenge.

01:20:13.926 --> 01:20:15.914
MARISHA: I take one of her darker overcoats.

01:20:15.914 --> 01:20:22.697
LAURA: The rest of the days I'm going to parade
around the deck in her clothing. Different outfits.

01:20:22.697 --> 01:20:26.171
MARISHA: Jester gives us a fashion show.

01:20:26.171 --> 01:20:29.909
TALIESIN: This is dark. Even for me, this is
dark.

01:20:31.555 --> 01:20:34.234
MATT: Anything else?

01:20:34.234 --> 01:20:37.603
LIAM: This is still the same day, correct?

01:20:37.603 --> 01:20:41.730
MATT: Yeah. We can continue this journey to the
second day if you want to, but it's up to you.

01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:45.118
LIAM: Yeah, hello, your hour is up, I need my cat
back now.

01:20:45.118 --> 01:20:48.202
DEBORAH: (sighs) Give him back.

01:20:48.202 --> 01:20:56.172
LIAM: Okay. Maybe another day, though, you can see
him again. I'm sorry that I used arcane trickery

01:20:56.172 --> 01:21:00.648
on you. May I borrow the Happy Fun Ball for a few
hours, just to play with it?

01:21:00.648 --> 01:21:04.726
DEBORAH: Hmm, okay! I take it out of my box and I
roll it to you.

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:08.258
MATT: (crashing)

01:21:08.258 --> 01:21:11.974
LIAM: If you want this to poop coins, I don't
think you should do that too much.

01:21:11.974 --> 01:21:14.581
DEBORAH: I don't know, never was a problem
before.

01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:15.791
LIAM: You've had it for a week?

01:21:15.791 --> 01:21:16.677
DEBORAH: Yes.

01:21:16.677 --> 01:21:20.979
LIAM: Oh boy, oh boy, okay. I wander off with it
to study it.

01:21:20.979 --> 01:21:23.656
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:21:23.656 --> 01:21:27.765
DEBORAH: I put my head on his shoulder. What you
doing?

01:21:27.765 --> 01:21:38.855
LIAM: I rolled a 16. Sometimes it takes a while
for my mind to settle on truths, and I'm having a

01:21:38.855 --> 01:21:42.092
hard time thinking about it right-- you know,
maybe I will save this for later.

01:21:42.092 --> 01:21:42.971
MATT: You rolled a 16, you said?

01:21:42.971 --> 01:21:43.675
LIAM: Ja.

01:21:43.675 --> 01:21:49.953
MATT: As you're saying this absentmindedly, you
find another portion of it that previously was

01:21:49.953 --> 01:21:53.623
locked in place and wouldn't move. You manage to
rotate one band and all of a sudden it comes free

01:21:53.623 --> 01:21:59.393
and turns as well. You start shifting it a bit
and, as you turn, a little cylinder extends a

01:21:59.393 --> 01:22:06.168
little bit, and you press on it and you hear
(poof) There's another burst, but this one has a

01:22:06.168 --> 01:22:16.142
dull blue color to the burst of light. Suddenly
four cut jade pieces of stone appear and hit the ground.

01:22:16.142 --> 01:22:18.858
DEBORAH: Whoa, it never did that before.

01:22:18.858 --> 01:22:23.211
LIAM: Well, you just have to tinker with it a
little bit. Holy cats.

01:22:23.211 --> 01:22:24.650
LAURA: What! This is the best thing ever.

01:22:24.650 --> 01:22:25.553
LIAM: I pick up the jade.

01:22:25.553 --> 01:22:29.469
MATT: Each one's worth about 100 gold, if you want
to mark that down.

01:22:29.469 --> 01:22:32.413
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Upgrade!

01:22:32.413 --> 01:22:34.720
MARISHA: Are you still learning tattoos from
Orly?

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.109
LAURA: I know, I know, I know, that's exactly
where my mind went!

01:22:37.109 --> 01:22:44.539
LIAM: Are you looking to sell this, by any
chance?

01:22:44.539 --> 01:22:48.535
DEBORAH: I don't like money so much. What else you
got?

01:22:48.535 --> 01:22:50.495
LIAM: So a good trade, you're talking about.

01:22:50.495 --> 01:22:52.795
DEBORAH: That could work.

01:22:52.795 --> 01:22:56.797
LIAM: What about-- I'm going to throw out some
ideas here. I'm going to start spitballing,

01:22:56.797 --> 01:23:06.228
because I'm very curious about this. I love
puzzles. What about some sort of mystical tattoo?

01:23:06.228 --> 01:23:08.469
DEBORAH: What would it do?

01:23:08.469 --> 01:23:09.977
LIAM: Many things.

01:23:09.977 --> 01:23:11.804
DEBORAH: Many things?

01:23:11.804 --> 01:23:19.172
LIAM: I have been listening to my friend, Jester,
speak of them a lot. All the time.

01:23:19.172 --> 01:23:23.280
DEBORAH: I listen to her, too. She's got a lot of
fun stories.

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:33.446
LIAM: That is true. This one time, she watched an
ant carrying a piece of bread six or seven times

01:23:33.446 --> 01:23:36.398
larger than it up stairs.

01:23:36.398 --> 01:23:38.725
DEBORAH: Oh my goodness. I've never seen anything
like that!

01:23:38.725 --> 01:23:44.916
LIAM: I've never, either, but I take her word for
it because she's on the up and up. Maybe you talk

01:23:44.916 --> 01:23:52.485
to Jester about a mystical tattoo. That's one
thing on the table. You could be an honorary

01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:54.980
member of The Mighty Nein.

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:59.094
DEBORAH: Oh! Well, that sounds fun. I like
friends.

01:23:59.094 --> 01:24:00.914
LIAM: I do, too.

01:24:00.914 --> 01:24:04.045
DEBORAH: I go up, I put my arms around him and, if
he'll let me, I'll kiss him on the cheek.

01:24:04.045 --> 01:24:06.113
TRAVIS and LAURA: Aww.

01:24:06.113 --> 01:24:07.717
SAM: That's third base.

01:24:07.717 --> 01:24:11.582
(laughter)

01:24:11.582 --> 01:24:13.473
TRAVIS: Instant death.

01:24:13.473 --> 01:24:16.031
DEBORAH: Yes, make a saving throw.

01:24:16.031 --> 01:24:19.783
LIAM: (gasping)

01:24:20.416 --> 01:24:22.469
DEBORAH: I take my sphere.

01:24:22.469 --> 01:24:29.173
(laughter)

01:24:29.173 --> 01:24:32.475
DEBORAH: That's my next character.

01:24:32.475 --> 01:24:34.907
TRAVIS: Kiss of death.

01:24:34.907 --> 01:24:37.804
LIAM: Thank you.

01:24:37.804 --> 01:24:41.606
DEBORAH: Thank you for letting me play with your
cat.

01:24:41.606 --> 01:24:44.609
LIAM: Hey, you get the whole day.

01:24:44.609 --> 01:24:51.032
DEBORAH: I chase after her, we go play, and you
can play with the Fun Ball of Tricks.

01:24:51.032 --> 01:24:54.755
LIAM: Danke sch�n.

01:24:54.755 --> 01:24:57.972
MATT: Roll another investigation check, I guess.

01:24:57.972 --> 01:25:06.174
LIAM: (singing) That was a fun time. Good. I'm
short circuited from the kiss on the cheek. Yeah,

01:25:06.174 --> 01:25:08.667
no, I know, it's not helping! 22.

01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:17.233
MATT: From that place where you had it, you find
one of the other grinding bands-- it felt like

01:25:17.233 --> 01:25:21.666
sandpaper when you tried to move it-- is now
moving smooth, like it has no resistance, so you

01:25:21.666 --> 01:25:27.724
twist that one around and as you do, you hear this
clicking sound. It fits into place. There's

01:25:27.724 --> 01:25:34.707
another piece around that you hear give this very
faint (creaking) sound. You look for it and you

01:25:34.707 --> 01:25:40.553
find it, and there's a little knob. You turn the
knob and as you do, another section opens up on

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:46.597
one side, and then there's this flash and you look
over on the ground, and in the middle of the wood

01:25:46.597 --> 01:25:50.879
there's a black hole about a foot wide.

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:53.677
LAURA: Oh, this is definitely Pinhead stuff.

01:25:53.677 --> 01:25:57.404
DEBORAH: Whoa! I pick up the cat and I walk over.

01:25:57.404 --> 01:26:02.466
LIAM: No! Have you ever seen this before?

01:26:02.466 --> 01:26:04.497
DEBORAH: No, this is all new to me.

01:26:04.497 --> 01:26:05.974
LIAM: We don't see through?

01:26:05.974 --> 01:26:07.221
MATT: No, you look and it's just black.

01:26:07.221 --> 01:26:09.789
TRAVIS: It's just black?

01:26:09.789 --> 01:26:11.405
SAM: We can't see the next deck?

01:26:11.405 --> 01:26:12.043
MATT: No.

01:26:12.043 --> 01:26:13.107
SAM: Oh god.

01:26:13.107 --> 01:26:14.092
DEBORAH: We should jump in. Jump in!

01:26:14.092 --> 01:26:15.880
LIAM: No, that is a very bad idea, Twiggy.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.074
DEBORAH: (as Trixie) I would jump in!

01:26:20.483 --> 01:26:24.143
LIAM: If you want to make that arrangement with
your squirrel, you are perfectly welcome, but my

01:26:24.143 --> 01:26:33.130
cat is not going in that hole. (foomph) For the
moment. Something-- Captain!

01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:35.674
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll come running down. Yeah, what
is it?

01:26:35.674 --> 01:26:38.250
MARISHA: And his first mate.

01:26:39.619 --> 01:26:43.544
TRAVIS: You don't have to announce it when you
show up. Don't yell your superiority. We'll get

01:26:43.544 --> 01:26:45.482
you a shirt or something.

01:26:45.482 --> 01:26:51.685
DEBORAH: I take out five ball bearings and drop
them into the hole. You hear it hit?

01:26:51.685 --> 01:26:55.859
MATT: As you let go, they make no sound. They just
disappear into it.

01:26:55.859 --> 01:26:58.051
LIAM: And it's traveling with the boat?

01:26:58.051 --> 01:27:01.067
LAURA: Am I still seeing from the crow's nest all
of this shit happening?

01:27:01.067 --> 01:27:03.363
MATT: No, you just see Fjord and Beau go down.

01:27:03.363 --> 01:27:06.406
LAURA: What? What's going on?

01:27:06.406 --> 01:27:14.974
LIAM: Is there any lumber? There's no oars. Are
there any rifles left on this boat, or anything long?

01:27:14.974 --> 01:27:15.719
TRAVIS: Rope?

01:27:15.719 --> 01:27:16.990
LIAM: Yeah, rope, is there rope?

01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.972
TRAVIS: I got 100 feet of rope.

01:27:17.972 --> 01:27:24.678
LIAM: Let me borrow that. I'm flustered. I start
lowering rope down in, maybe five or six feet.

01:27:24.678 --> 01:27:26.593
MATT: Okay, it gets to about five or six feet.

01:27:26.593 --> 01:27:27.612
LIAM: And I pull it back out.

01:27:27.612 --> 01:27:29.576
MATT: Okay. It's rope.

01:27:29.576 --> 01:27:31.344
LAURA: It's fine?

01:27:31.344 --> 01:27:36.830
LIAM: I don't know that it's fine. There's a hole
to nowhere in the middle of the boat that came out

01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:41.983
of Happy Fun Ball. What do you call this thing?

01:27:41.983 --> 01:27:47.480
LAURA and DEBORAH: Happy Fun Ball of Tricks!

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:54.941
MARISHA: So it creates things. It creates money,
it creates gems, and it creates holes to--

01:27:54.941 --> 01:27:56.197
TRAVIS: Put your hand in there.

01:27:56.468 --> 01:27:59.133
LIAM: No, I am not going to put my hand in there.

01:27:59.133 --> 01:28:01.289
TRAVIS: I'm reach down and put the tip of my
finger in the hole.

01:28:01.289 --> 01:28:04.229
MATT: Okay. Temperature feels a little colder, but
it goes in.

01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:06.604
TRAVIS: Just feels cool.

01:28:06.604 --> 01:28:09.389
LAURA: Take your finger out. Is it gone now?

01:28:09.389 --> 01:28:12.258
TRAVIS: (yells)

01:28:12.991 --> 01:28:15.281
DEBORAH: Do another one, do another one!

01:28:16.865 --> 01:28:23.223
LIAM: I mean, at the very least we need to put a
plank of wood over this so that nobody falls into it.

01:28:23.223 --> 01:28:24.937
MATT: (foomph) It's gone.

01:28:24.937 --> 01:28:31.487
LAURA: Oh, it only lasts for a little bit. I
wonder where it would have taken us? Was it big

01:28:31.487 --> 01:28:32.759
enough for us to go through?

01:28:32.759 --> 01:28:34.060
TRAVIS: Like a person-sized hole?

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.556
MATT: It was about a foot across, so a smaller
person, maybe, but a lot of you guys it would have

01:28:37.556 --> 01:28:40.165
been a tight squeeze. Not Caduceus at all.

01:28:40.165 --> 01:28:46.856
LIAM: Fjord, First Mate Beauregard, I'm glad
you're here. I want to introduce you to the new

01:28:46.856 --> 01:28:50.353
honorary member of The Mighty Nein.

01:28:50.353 --> 01:28:55.927
TRAVIS: Oh. My goodness. You must have proved
yourself greatly.

01:28:55.927 --> 01:28:57.885
MARISHA: Welcome to The Mighty Nein.

01:28:57.885 --> 01:29:01.209
DEBORAH: Why thank you. We'll be The Mighty Ten!
No? That's not how it works?

01:29:01.209 --> 01:29:06.038
TRAVIS: We vote on the name every couple of
months, but it's going to be a while.

01:29:06.038 --> 01:29:08.181
DEBORAH: Oh.

01:29:08.181 --> 01:29:12.167
TRAVIS: Well, she needs a hat.

01:29:12.167 --> 01:29:15.026
LIAM: Yep. The bigger, the better.

01:29:15.026 --> 01:29:18.511
TRAVIS: Every pirate needs a hat.

01:29:18.511 --> 01:29:20.939
LAURA: Do you want one of Avantika's hats?

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:22.716
DEBORAH: Are they my size?

01:29:22.716 --> 01:29:24.708
LAURA: It would be really big on you.

01:29:24.708 --> 01:29:29.341
DEBORAH: We put a hat on and it comes down to
here. As I move, it slides across.

01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:35.413
LAURA: I'll tell you what. I will use my pretty
paint to paint her a really cool pirate hat that

01:29:35.413 --> 01:29:41.232
is her size. Okay. It's like this big.

01:29:41.232 --> 01:29:43.396
DEBORAH: And it has the points on it.

01:29:43.396 --> 01:29:47.825
LAURA: Exactly what you want, yes. It has the
tricorn. And do you want feathers and stuff?

01:29:47.825 --> 01:29:49.776
DEBORAH: One big purple feather.

01:29:49.776 --> 01:29:51.860
LAURA: You got it, one big purple feather.

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:58.514
MATT: She takes this couple of materials out and
this pot of paint. As she paints with it, it

01:29:58.514 --> 01:30:06.108
begins to take shape and become a physical object,
representative of what she drew.

01:30:06.108 --> 01:30:11.195
LAURA: Do you want any sparkly stuff on it, or a
bow? Sometimes bows are really pretty.

01:30:11.195 --> 01:30:15.162
DEBORAH: I have a feather already. Can you put a
little squirrel?

01:30:15.162 --> 01:30:21.676
LAURA: Totally. It will be a squirrel figurine on
this, next to the feather. It'll be really pretty,

01:30:21.676 --> 01:30:25.478
okay. There we go. (poof)

01:30:25.478 --> 01:30:29.011
DEBORAH: (gasps) I take it, and I put it on, and
I'm like: Now I'm a real pirate!

01:30:29.011 --> 01:30:30.809
LAURA: You look like a really good pirate.

01:30:30.809 --> 01:30:31.949
DEBORAH: Thanks!

01:30:31.949 --> 01:30:35.739
LIAM: I will say, what we have learned on all our
travels on the ocean is, the days are long and you

01:30:35.739 --> 01:30:37.497
have to make your own fun.

01:30:37.497 --> 01:30:41.042
DEBORAH: Oh boy, you're telling me.

01:30:42.264 --> 01:30:44.898
MATT: The sphere is still locked in the place
where you had it last, and there's that one little

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:49.814
knob that's still visible from where it was. It
seems like, with each stage that you've unlocked

01:30:49.814 --> 01:30:52.379
of this, it's opened up another stage.

01:30:52.379 --> 01:30:53.528
LIAM: It's getting more pokey?

01:30:53.528 --> 01:30:54.846
MATT: A little bit.

01:30:54.846 --> 01:30:56.411
LIAM: Less smooth and spherical?

01:30:56.411 --> 01:30:58.539
MATT: Less smooth, and there are more elements
that are starting to protrude a bit.

01:30:58.539 --> 01:31:03.721
LIAM: Does this thing, every day, sort of shrink
back in on itself, or do you ever slide it back

01:31:03.721 --> 01:31:06.972
together? Or has it been getting more complex over
time?

01:31:06.972 --> 01:31:11.304
DEBORAH: I've never gotten it further than that
first stage, so I don't know.

01:31:11.304 --> 01:31:12.387
LIAM: Oh, okay.

01:31:15.377 --> 01:31:17.492
MARISHA: Do it again.

01:31:18.485 --> 01:31:20.148
LIAM: It took me a few minutes to--

01:31:20.148 --> 01:31:21.225
DEBORAH: (as Trixie) Do it again!

01:31:21.225 --> 01:31:22.113
LIAM: Oh, okay.

01:31:22.113 --> 01:31:24.561
MATT: All you have to do is press on that to
trigger it again.

01:31:24.561 --> 01:31:26.561
LIAM: To press-- oh. (clicks)

01:31:26.561 --> 01:31:29.159
MATT: (poof) That hole appears again.

01:31:29.159 --> 01:31:30.127
TRAVIS: Same size?

01:31:30.127 --> 01:31:31.940
MATT: Same size, in a slightly different
location.

01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:32.925
MARISHA: Nott!

01:31:32.925 --> 01:31:34.069
SAM: What?

01:31:34.069 --> 01:31:35.618
MARISHA: Do you want to go in a hole?

01:31:35.618 --> 01:31:38.617
LAURA: (gasps) What if the hole disappears while
Nott is still in it?

01:31:38.617 --> 01:31:40.762
TRAVIS: I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:31:40.762 --> 01:31:47.105
DEBORAH: I'll take out my lantern, and I strike it
so that it's lit. I attach it to a string. I go

01:31:47.105 --> 01:31:50.066
and I start to lower it down the hole and see if
it does anything.

01:31:50.066 --> 01:31:54.459
MATT: As the lantern hits the darkness, the
darkness consumes it like water. Once the lantern

01:31:54.459 --> 01:31:57.878
is submerged within the darkness, no light. You
don't even see the lantern.

01:31:57.878 --> 01:31:59.260
DEBORAH: Then if I pull it up?

01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.847
MATT: Still lit.

01:32:00.847 --> 01:32:01.941
LAURA: I feel like we should put our head through
it.

01:32:01.941 --> 01:32:05.445
TRAVIS: I think so, too, but you've got to do it
quick because it's going to stop real quick.

01:32:05.445 --> 01:32:07.602
MARISHA: It's still a foot?

01:32:07.602 --> 01:32:08.400
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.447
TRAVIS: Do it, do it!

01:32:10.447 --> 01:32:11.978
LAURA: But do it really fast!

01:32:11.978 --> 01:32:13.605
SAM: I'm not doing that, no way! You're crazy!

01:32:13.605 --> 01:32:16.537
MATT: It's gone. It only lasts about a minute.

01:32:16.537 --> 01:32:18.919
LIAM: You could have been decapitated, doing
that.

01:32:18.919 --> 01:32:20.007
SAM: Yes! Thank you.

01:32:20.007 --> 01:32:21.225
MARISHA: Well, he says it lasts a minute.

01:32:21.225 --> 01:32:23.448
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's been about twice, a minute each
time.

01:32:23.448 --> 01:32:25.838
MATT: Each time it's lasted about a minute, yeah.

01:32:25.838 --> 01:32:28.501
MARISHA: When we've timed it!

01:32:29.083 --> 01:32:32.789
MATT: Both times, it's been approximately the same
length of time, close to a minute.

01:32:32.789 --> 01:32:35.696
LIAM: Keen Mind, nah, it's a minute.

01:32:35.696 --> 01:32:39.330
TRAVIS: Jester and Beau, boulder-parchment-shears.
Figure out who's going to put their head in and

01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:40.603
help us see it.

01:32:40.603 --> 01:32:42.406
SAM: Why do we care what's in the-- oh, man.

01:32:42.406 --> 01:32:43.352
LAURA: You have to do it!

01:32:43.352 --> 01:32:44.238
MARISHA: All right, I'll do it.

01:32:44.238 --> 01:32:46.536
LIAM: Are you readied?

01:32:46.536 --> 01:32:47.533
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:32:47.533 --> 01:32:50.446
TRAVIS: I'll grab onto her britches as she's doing
it.

01:32:50.446 --> 01:32:54.153
TALIESIN: I'm finally walking in because everybody
has vanished off the ship, and no one is eating anything.

01:32:54.153 --> 01:32:55.295
DEBORAH: You're missing it!

01:32:55.295 --> 01:32:56.502
MARISHA: Caduceus, grab my feet, just in case.

01:32:56.502 --> 01:32:57.836
TALIESIN: What are we--

01:32:57.836 --> 01:32:59.101
MARISHA: Just grab my feet.

01:32:59.101 --> 01:33:01.784
TALIESIN: Okay, I like grabbing feet. Here we
are.

01:33:01.784 --> 01:33:02.662
LAURA: I'll get ready with Cure Wounds.

01:33:02.662 --> 01:33:04.323
MATT: The hole opens up.

01:33:04.323 --> 01:33:05.594
SAM: It's open! Go!

01:33:05.594 --> 01:33:08.266
MATT: You look inside; it's darkness.

01:33:08.266 --> 01:33:10.057
MARISHA: Drop me further!

01:33:10.057 --> 01:33:11.542
TRAVIS: Down to her feet.

01:33:11.542 --> 01:33:13.384
MATT: Still darkness. You can put your goggles on,
if you want.

01:33:13.384 --> 01:33:14.407
MARISHA: Goggles, yeah!

01:33:14.407 --> 01:33:18.441
MATT: Put goggles on, and your face, as he pushes
you down further, you hit something. It's soft.

01:33:18.441 --> 01:33:21.619
You pull back a bit and look, and there's a pile
of objects there.

01:33:21.619 --> 01:33:22.613
LAURA: Take them!

01:33:22.613 --> 01:33:23.663
MARISHA: I grab a few!

01:33:23.663 --> 01:33:26.169
MATT: Okay. As you pull her out before she slips.

01:33:26.169 --> 01:33:26.997
TALIESIN: Oh, yep, I'm on it.

01:33:26.997 --> 01:33:28.169
MARISHA: Pull me back!

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:34.945
MATT: As you're pulling back, a few things start
tumbling out of this thing. You grab them and pull

01:33:34.945 --> 01:33:39.351
them in. You pull out, and she emerges. You have
this pile of reddish cloth, and a strange metal

01:33:39.351 --> 01:33:43.639
object of some kind, and a couple other things.
You pull the rest of them out that's dangling in.

01:33:43.639 --> 01:33:47.014
As soon as it does, the hole closes.

01:33:47.014 --> 01:33:49.475
TALIESIN: Wow! That's cool. Do that again.

01:33:49.475 --> 01:33:51.722
LAURA: Oh my god, what if it's a safe in another
dimension?

01:33:51.722 --> 01:33:52.721
LIAM: What did you see? Could you see?

01:33:52.721 --> 01:33:55.967
MATT: You look at it. First off--

01:33:55.967 --> 01:33:57.735
TRAVIS: Do I look the same?

01:33:57.735 --> 01:33:59.901
MARISHA: What is my face?

01:33:59.901 --> 01:34:01.978
MATT: She's pulling her tongue out.

01:34:01.978 --> 01:34:04.812
TRAVIS: Start speaking in Latin.

01:34:04.812 --> 01:34:14.757
MATT: First off, you hear (impacts) as two boots
fall out of this pile of clothes she has, these

01:34:14.757 --> 01:34:24.471
really nice leather boots that are fur on the top.
They hit the ground. There's a metal rod that

01:34:24.471 --> 01:34:33.326
looks like a staff that you hold and pull there.
The other thing is a bundle of this really heavy,

01:34:33.407 --> 01:34:42.421
warm, winter-coat velvet material. It's a deep
crimson-red color with golden trim on it. As you

01:34:42.421 --> 01:34:48.298
unravel it, there's an embroidered symbol across
the back of it. That's the symbol, right there.

01:34:48.298 --> 01:34:51.026
LAURA: Do we recognize it?

01:34:51.026 --> 01:34:55.144
MATT: You do not. You guys have never seen this
before.

01:34:55.144 --> 01:34:56.947
LAURA: That's definitely an H with a bow.

01:34:56.947 --> 01:34:58.485
SAM: Or it could be the tail of a whale or
something.

01:34:58.485 --> 01:34:59.862
LIAM: Beauregard, let me see this.

01:34:59.862 --> 01:35:02.276
MATT: I mean, you're looking at it there. There's
not much more to it than that.

01:35:02.276 --> 01:35:04.000
LIAM: But it's on the coat, yeah?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.005
TRAVIS: There's a watermark up here. I can see it.
It's amazing!

01:35:06.005 --> 01:35:08.505
MATT: That watermark is part of the paper! It's
not part of the actual symbol.

01:35:08.505 --> 01:35:10.592
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't believe, Matt! I don't believe
it!

01:35:10.592 --> 01:35:12.500
TALIESIN: The fourth wall lies!

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:16.171
LIAM: It's the coat, it is boots, and the third
thing was--

01:35:16.171 --> 01:35:21.467
MATT: It's a metal staff. You look at it and it's
a metallic staff, about three to four feet long.

01:35:21.467 --> 01:35:25.246
It has a seam in the middle of it, like it's two
pieces joined.

01:35:25.246 --> 01:35:28.271
LAURA: Was there anything else in there?

01:35:28.271 --> 01:35:34.830
MARISHA: It was super dark. I hit a barrier. It
felt like it was a barrier of stuff.

01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:38.540
LAURA: What if this ball is somebody's treasury or
something?

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.666
SAM: Or if it's their pink haversack!

01:35:41.666 --> 01:35:44.249
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean! They've been
storing stuff in it.

01:35:44.249 --> 01:35:45.386
LIAM: It's a vault.

01:35:45.386 --> 01:35:46.477
LAURA: (gasps) It's a vault!

01:35:46.477 --> 01:35:48.034
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:35:48.034 --> 01:35:50.673
TRAVIS: We've got to figure out what all this
stuff is, first. I mean, just so it's not a pole

01:35:50.673 --> 01:35:52.333
and a pair of shitty boots.

01:35:52.333 --> 01:35:58.102
LIAM: Here, hold this. I give her the doohickus,
and I say: I need 30 minutes. I gather up all this

01:35:58.102 --> 01:35:59.950
stuff, and I walk with it, very happily.

01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:01.214
LAURA: I follow him and sit next to him.

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:04.458
MATT: We'll say, for the sake of brevity, the
boots are not magical. They're just really warm

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:07.760
boots. The cloak is not magical; it's just a very
warm cloak.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.178
TRAVIS: With that symbol on the back.

01:36:09.178 --> 01:36:15.578
MATT: With the symbol on it. The staff is faintly
magical, and what it is is it acts like a hand

01:36:15.578 --> 01:36:20.616
warmer. You take the two parts, and you slide them
together, and it clicks. The metal emanates enough

01:36:20.616 --> 01:36:25.661
heat to warm the hands of whoever's holding it.
This appears to be a set of travel gear for

01:36:25.661 --> 01:36:28.225
whoever once might have had this.

01:36:28.225 --> 01:36:33.589
LIAM: I also use an additional ten minutes to
touch the coat and cast Comprehend Languages on

01:36:33.589 --> 01:36:35.704
this, see if it says anything.

01:36:35.704 --> 01:36:36.869
MATT and LIAM: It's a name.

01:36:36.869 --> 01:36:38.322
MATT: Yep. Halas.

01:36:38.322 --> 01:36:39.371
SAM: What is it?

01:36:39.371 --> 01:36:43.074
MATT: Halas. H-A-L-A-S.

01:36:43.074 --> 01:36:45.743
LIAM: Well, we have just robbed Halas.

01:36:45.743 --> 01:36:47.363
TRAVIS: Have any of us heard that name before?

01:36:47.363 --> 01:36:48.248
MATT: (disagreement) Mm-mm.

01:36:48.248 --> 01:36:54.518
MARISHA: Do we know what language that name hails
from?

01:36:58.143 --> 01:37:06.527
MATT: It seems to have some roots in Zemnian, but
it's a divergent element, so a name that hasn't

01:37:06.527 --> 01:37:11.679
been used in a long, long time. Kind of like--

01:37:11.679 --> 01:37:12.720
TRAVIS: Archibald, or--

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:20.677
MATT: Yeah, like Melchor. Things that are old
historical names. In fact, roll a history check.

01:37:20.677 --> 01:37:23.996
LIAM: Old magic. Natural one.

01:37:23.996 --> 01:37:28.659
MATT: It slips from you. There's something. You're
like, hmm.

01:37:28.659 --> 01:37:33.708
TRAVIS: Beau, when you hit that buffer, did it
feel hard and solid, or was it soft and earthen?

01:37:33.708 --> 01:37:41.239
MATT: Your face hit the cloak. You were like
(impact) into this pile of soft, heavy material.

01:37:41.239 --> 01:37:43.041
MARISHA: It was cloak and stuff.

01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:45.210
TRAVIS: Did you find a portal into somebody's
wardrobe?

01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:52.231
MARISHA: It was cold in there. I don't know. He's
saying that the staff heats his hands, and there

01:37:52.231 --> 01:37:55.114
was a cloak. Maybe wherever this haversack was
from--

01:37:55.114 --> 01:37:58.214
MATT: A couple of ball bearings fall out of the
cloak from what was dropped in there earlier.

01:37:58.214 --> 01:37:59.402
LAURA: Oh, cool!

01:37:59.402 --> 01:38:01.402
DEBORAH: I collect them back and put them in my
bag.

01:38:01.402 --> 01:38:03.865
TRAVIS: Well, at least it's the same place each
time, so if it does close off, we at least know

01:38:03.865 --> 01:38:05.040
how to find you.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.850
SAM: Sure. Why are you looking at me when you say
that?

01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:08.043
TRAVIS: You're going in.

01:38:08.043 --> 01:38:09.317
SAM: No, I'm not going in!

01:38:09.317 --> 01:38:11.103
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're really good at finding
stuff.

01:38:11.103 --> 01:38:16.042
DEBORAH: I'll go in! If you don't want to go, I'll
go, or I'll go with you. Want to go together?

01:38:16.042 --> 01:38:19.442
SAM: Into somebody's laundry bag?

01:38:19.442 --> 01:38:20.844
DEBORAH: Why not?

01:38:20.844 --> 01:38:22.140
SAM: All right.

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:28.904
MARISHA: It feels like someone was raptured, and
we're stealing their stuff. That's what it feels like.

01:38:28.904 --> 01:38:31.537
LIAM: Just roll with it, though.

01:38:31.537 --> 01:38:33.401
SAM: I'll take a big swig and get ready.

01:38:33.401 --> 01:38:36.504
TRAVIS: When she was yelling on the other side of
the portal, was there any sound that came between

01:38:36.504 --> 01:38:38.500
the two? Between the portal? Nothing?

01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:39.500
MATT: Nothing.

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:45.603
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to tie this rope around
your waist, okay. Then this rope is going to tie

01:38:45.603 --> 01:38:52.219
around your waist, now, so you guys are tied
together. Then we're going to hold it up top.

01:38:52.219 --> 01:38:56.244
Okay, you have a minute. If you start to go
too long, we're going to pull you up.

01:38:56.346 --> 01:38:59.877
TRAVIS: Or if you're ready to come back, tug twice
on the rope.

01:38:59.877 --> 01:39:01.593
DEBORAH: I hold his hand, if he'll let me.

01:39:01.593 --> 01:39:02.602
MATT: Her hand.

01:39:02.602 --> 01:39:04.672
DEBORAH: Her hand, sorry. I hold her hand, if
she'll let me.

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:08.008
SAM: Of course. I squeeze it way too hard.

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:09.799
LIAM: Okay, are you ready?

01:39:09.799 --> 01:39:10.766
SAM: Yes.

01:39:10.766 --> 01:39:12.077
LIAM: Eins, zwei, drei, (click).

01:39:12.077 --> 01:39:15.051
SAM: (yelling)

01:39:15.051 --> 01:39:20.849
MATT: One by one, you guys jump in, one after the
other, and you both tumble in and hit a floor.

01:39:20.849 --> 01:39:22.815
DEBORAH: Can we see anything?

01:39:22.815 --> 01:39:27.456
MATT: Looking around, you both have darkvision
because gnomes. It's a cylindrical chamber. It

01:39:27.456 --> 01:39:30.123
feels almost like a natural rock interior.

01:39:30.123 --> 01:39:31.773
DEBORAH: Doors out, anything like that? Any
exits?

01:39:31.773 --> 01:39:33.548
MATT: No. It's just a little pocket.

01:39:33.548 --> 01:39:34.781
DEBORAH: What do we see, what stuff?

01:39:34.781 --> 01:39:38.871
MATT: You see two other ball bearings you left
behind, and that's it. It looks like you've

01:39:38.871 --> 01:39:41.022
cleaned out what was in this pocket.

01:39:41.022 --> 01:39:42.649
SAM and DEBORAH: Tug, tug!

01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:44.575
MATT: You guys emerge.

01:39:44.575 --> 01:39:46.853
DEBORAH: That was so much fun!

01:39:46.853 --> 01:39:50.525
SAM: It was crazy down there. The lights, the
monsters!

01:39:50.525 --> 01:39:51.519
TRAVIS: Really?

01:39:51.519 --> 01:39:53.432
SAM: It was insane!

01:39:53.432 --> 01:39:54.325
TRAVIS: You're so brave!

01:39:54.325 --> 01:39:57.764
SAM: It was a parade of horrors.

01:39:57.764 --> 01:39:58.754
TRAVIS: You're full of shit, aren't you?

01:39:58.754 --> 01:40:01.124
SAM: Yeah, there was nothing down there.

01:40:01.124 --> 01:40:02.091
LAURA: That was it?

01:40:02.091 --> 01:40:05.262
SAM: No, it was nothing. But it's a lot of space,
so if we wanted to store something for

01:40:05.262 --> 01:40:07.476
safekeeping, it's a good spot to do it.

01:40:07.476 --> 01:40:12.130
MATT: The area on the sphere where you've been
pressing this button, you look and it's freed

01:40:12.130 --> 01:40:14.711
another area as well that can continue to be
solved.

01:40:14.711 --> 01:40:16.838
LAURA: Yeah, do it!

01:40:16.838 --> 01:40:21.568
TRAVIS: As a note, the previous function of the
sphere, we can access? Or is it one function at a

01:40:21.568 --> 01:40:23.962
time as it changes?

01:40:23.962 --> 01:40:29.522
MATT: As it looks right now, you need to shift it
back to use a previous function. Each thing you

01:40:29.522 --> 01:40:35.022
slide unlocks the next use, but it closes off the
previous one until you reverse it.

01:40:35.022 --> 01:40:37.399
LIAM: Which I am memorizing.

01:40:37.399 --> 01:40:42.209
MARISHA: I go to Fjord. You've told us about the
Halas thing?

01:40:42.209 --> 01:40:43.705
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

01:40:43.705 --> 01:40:52.725
MARISHA: Is this perhaps something to do with Sir
Cadigan and Port Damali stuff? Do you know a

01:40:52.725 --> 01:40:55.461
Cadigan? Would I recognize the name Hadigas?

01:40:55.461 --> 01:40:56.117
MATT: You wouldn't.

01:40:56.117 --> 01:40:57.959
MATT: Cadigan.

01:40:57.959 --> 01:40:59.234
MARISHA: No, Halas.

01:40:59.234 --> 01:41:01.139
MATT: Oh, Halas? You roll a history check, too.

01:41:01.139 --> 01:41:03.192
MARISHA: To see if this is his old stash.

01:41:03.192 --> 01:41:04.881
MATT: Yeah, roll a history check.

01:41:04.881 --> 01:41:10.193
MARISHA: That's absolutely horrifying. Ten.

01:41:10.193 --> 01:41:19.084
MATT: If they did teach it, you probably weren't
paying attention that day at the Archive, unfortunately.

01:41:19.084 --> 01:41:23.339
DEBORAH: Would I know it in relation to Sir
Cadigan, the person I took it from?

01:41:23.339 --> 01:41:26.155
MATT: Roll a history check.

01:41:26.818 --> 01:41:28.215
SAM: Come on, Deborah.

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:30.488
LIAM: Somebody, come on, three rollers.

01:41:30.488 --> 01:41:31.686
DEBORAH: 17.

01:41:31.686 --> 01:41:38.261
MATT: No. None at all. You've never heard the name
Halas before, anywhere in Port Damali or in any of

01:41:38.261 --> 01:41:41.651
your travels, especially in relation to Sir
Cadigan.

01:41:41.651 --> 01:41:51.574
DEBORAH: I turn to everybody, and at first I go,
(straining), nope. Sir Cadigan was a big old

01:41:51.574 --> 01:41:55.577
meanie, but I don't think he had anything to do
with this.

01:41:55.577 --> 01:41:58.785
MARISHA: I mean, you've mentioned Sir Cadigan
being a big old meanie several times. What did he

01:41:58.785 --> 01:42:01.122
do? Did you witness something?

01:42:01.122 --> 01:42:05.483
DEBORAH: (straining) Can't remember. But I think I
might be like this because of him.

01:42:05.483 --> 01:42:06.876
LAURA: Like what?

01:42:06.876 --> 01:42:07.917
SAM: Adorable?

01:42:07.917 --> 01:42:13.930
DEBORAH: (as Trixie) A little weird! (as Twiggy)
Sorry. She talks sometimes.

01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:17.188
SAM: He made you socially awkward?

01:42:17.188 --> 01:42:22.184
DEBORAH: I remember it was really dark, and it was
really long. I had nobody to talk to, so I made up

01:42:22.184 --> 01:42:29.190
all these people to talk to. Finally, when I got
out, wow is it a big, beautiful world! I'm so glad

01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:30.336
I met you guys.

01:42:30.336 --> 01:42:31.071
SAM: You were trapped somewhere?

01:42:31.071 --> 01:42:31.820
DEBORAH: Somewhere.

01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:33.338
LIAM: Were you in this ball?

01:42:33.338 --> 01:42:40.044
DEBORAH: I don't think so. It didn't look like
where I was. All I know, it was that big old

01:42:40.044 --> 01:42:42.215
meanie Sir Cadigan who put me in there.

01:42:42.215 --> 01:42:44.381
LAURA and LIAM: What did he look like?

01:42:44.381 --> 01:42:56.577
DEBORAH: He's twice my size. He's very skinny. He
wore this big ring with a green gem on it. I

01:42:56.577 --> 01:43:00.288
remember because he used to stick his fingers
through the bars to scare me.

01:43:00.288 --> 01:43:02.251
TRAVIS: How'd you escape?

01:43:02.251 --> 01:43:06.334
DEBORAH: I was really tricksy because I would sit
there, and I would think, and I would practice all

01:43:06.334 --> 01:43:15.139
of my tricks. I was able to get him to watch my
trick. He thought that I ran down that way, but

01:43:15.139 --> 01:43:19.646
really I was hiding in the back. I snuck out, and
I ran the other direction. I was able to run, run,

01:43:19.646 --> 01:43:22.081
run! I've been running ever since.

01:43:22.081 --> 01:43:23.278
SAM: This was in Port Damali?

01:43:23.278 --> 01:43:24.348
DEBORAH: Yes.

01:43:24.348 --> 01:43:30.506
TRAVIS: It sounds real familiar.

01:43:30.506 --> 01:43:34.843
LIAM: Why don't you all take ten steps back, and
we'll see what this next hinge does?

01:43:34.843 --> 01:43:36.377
TALIESIN: I'm excited.

01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:41.790
MATT: Okay, you all step back about ten paces.
Anyone want to help, or you going with your

01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:42.838
standard roll?

01:43:42.838 --> 01:43:44.302
LIAM: Oh, investigation for it, yeah.

01:43:44.302 --> 01:43:47.823
MATT: Yep.

01:43:47.823 --> 01:43:50.109
LIAM: Investigation, 21.

01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:57.329
MATT: Okay. That hole appears again. You're unable
to get past that point. You're hitting a barrier,

01:43:57.329 --> 01:44:01.482
and you're clicking it forward. There's something
about the puzzle that's escaping you. You feel

01:44:01.482 --> 01:44:03.770
like you're not quite-- you're on the cusp.

01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:05.205
DEBORAH: Can I help him?

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:06.951
MATT: If you want to try it again.

01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:11.118
DEBORAH: Just try it again? Okay. Yeah, I'll try
it again. I come up, and I say: I've been

01:44:11.118 --> 01:44:13.055
practicing. Let me try.

01:44:13.055 --> 01:44:15.452
MATT: If you want to, either you both can roll
individually, or one of you can roll with

01:44:15.452 --> 01:44:17.056
advantage as you're helping the other.

01:44:17.056 --> 01:44:18.933
LIAM: I would give me the advantage, probably.

01:44:18.933 --> 01:44:20.781
DEBORAH: I have a plus ten investigation.

01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:22.525
LIAM: Oh, shit!

01:44:22.525 --> 01:44:25.586
TRAVIS: I have a plus ten!

01:44:25.586 --> 01:44:27.861
LIAM: I'm at plus eight. Yeah, sure.

01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:32.192
MATT: As you hand the sphere over, holding the
places, Twiggy goes in and takes hold of it. Both

01:44:32.192 --> 01:44:34.234
of you together begin to try and rotate and figure
it out.

01:44:34.234 --> 01:44:40.117
DEBORAH: I squint my eyes, and I look at it real
hard, and I roll a 28.

01:44:41.982 --> 01:44:47.837
MATT: At that point, both together, Twiggy finds
this small, rotating piece on the very edge that

01:44:47.837 --> 01:44:53.190
turns and turns. As it does, another cylindrical
sphere slowly emits from it, like you're rotating

01:44:53.190 --> 01:44:54.940
a pencil lead that pushes out.

01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:57.717
DEBORAH: It takes three fingers to do it at the
same time.

01:44:57.717 --> 01:45:01.067
MATT: You twist it, and you push it in, and it
actually pushes in about an inch and then clicks

01:45:01.067 --> 01:45:08.463
inside, recessed. As that happens, a top part
opens up a little bit. Caleb, you take that and

01:45:08.463 --> 01:45:16.248
rotate it. As it clicks into place, you hear
(rising tone, whoosh). Flash of green light.

01:45:16.248 --> 01:45:18.378
TRAVIS: Green light's never good.

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:21.578
MATT: Fills the entire chamber. That's where we're
going to go to break.

01:45:21.578 --> 01:45:24.915
(yelling)

01:45:24.915 --> 01:45:26.558
TRAVIS: And they never come back.

01:45:26.558 --> 01:45:28.477
DEBORAH: And we never return.

01:45:28.477 --> 01:45:32.859
MATT: Well, that was a fun campaign, guys. It was
a lot of fun.

01:45:32.859 --> 01:45:35.805
TALIESIN: (English accent) Don't touch it, Mum,
it's evil!

01:45:35.805 --> 01:45:37.600
SAM: Wow.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.640
TRAVIS: How many times did you mess with it? Like
six.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.962
LIAM: Remember that sphere?

01:45:41.962 --> 01:45:45.120
TRAVIS: What's it do? What's it do? (explosion)

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.032
MATT: I love it. Before we go to break, we have a
giveaway. Our fantastic friends at Wyrmwood have

01:45:50.032 --> 01:45:56.159
this amazing dice tray to give away. It is the
wenge dice vault with tiger maple inlay, that

01:45:56.159 --> 01:46:03.024
beautiful two-tone. This will be going to one of
our fantastic victors to this. To enter, you have

01:46:03.024 --> 01:46:07.447
to head over to the Critical Role Twitch chat,
that's twitch.tv/criticalrole, and enter the word

01:46:07.447 --> 01:46:13.636
"stowaway." Stowaway is the word. Enter it once;
more than that, you'll be disqualified. Once

01:46:13.636 --> 01:46:17.635
again, only for people in the US and Canada,
excluding Quebec, because of stupid giveaway laws.

01:46:17.635 --> 01:46:19.946
Anyway, we'll have the winner when we come back.
We'll see you in a few minutes.

01:46:22.204 --> 01:46:27.009
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Before we get into
the game, we do have a winner. The winner of our

01:46:27.009 --> 01:46:33.899
fantastic Wyrmwood dice vault giveaway this
evening is Antc_clueless. Congratulations on your

01:46:33.899 --> 01:46:44.068
complicated online name and your victory. We'll
get this sent to you ASAP. So a flash of green

01:46:44.068 --> 01:46:54.507
light energy fills the chamber. As it subsides,
you all take a second to blink as the light is

01:46:54.507 --> 01:47:03.546
dimmer than it was on the inside of the ship.
Looking about, you are in a very dark chamber.

01:47:03.546 --> 01:47:06.665
You're no longer on the ship.

01:47:06.665 --> 01:47:07.725
DEBORAH: All of us?

01:47:07.725 --> 01:47:16.458
MATT: All of you. Except for Yasha, because she
was not nearby. This chamber is somewhat

01:47:16.458 --> 01:47:24.513
triangular, but the corners are curved. At each of
these walls, between each curvature, there is a

01:47:24.513 --> 01:47:30.814
banner hanging about 12 feet off the ground on a
brass rod. The banner hangs almost to the floor.

01:47:30.814 --> 01:47:40.210
You see four pillars a little closer inside the
chamber. Each banner is a different color. The

01:47:40.210 --> 01:47:48.647
ceiling's about 15 feet high and there are two
corpses on the floor nearby. Both long-dead and

01:47:48.647 --> 01:47:54.190
mummified, their skin paper-thin and pulled
against their bones, their faces twisted in

01:47:54.190 --> 01:48:05.437
horror. You see the light gray stone walls and
where these banners are, there are two on the side

01:48:05.437 --> 01:48:12.143
parallel to each other and two on the other. There
is a red, a green, a blue, and a black. Each of

01:48:12.143 --> 01:48:20.557
these banners has gold embroidery down the sides
and a gold embroidered symbol in the middle. The

01:48:20.557 --> 01:48:24.563
same symbol as the cloak that you found.

01:48:24.563 --> 01:48:30.079
DEBORAH: Did the happy ball of fun tricks come
with us?

01:48:30.079 --> 01:48:31.139
MATT: Nope.

01:48:31.139 --> 01:48:32.459
LAURA: Oh no.

01:48:32.459 --> 01:48:33.968
LIAM: I cast Mage Armor.

01:48:33.968 --> 01:48:40.269
TRAVIS: All four symbols are the same on all four
banners?

01:48:40.269 --> 01:48:41.132
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:48:41.132 --> 01:48:42.919
MARISHA: It was Hala?

01:48:42.919 --> 01:48:45.078
TRAVIS and MATT: Halas.

01:48:45.078 --> 01:48:46.718
DEBORAH: Exits? Do we see any exits?

01:48:46.718 --> 01:48:47.578
MATT: No.

01:48:47.578 --> 01:48:52.358
DEBORAH: Pedestals, are there anything on them?

01:48:52.358 --> 01:48:57.737
MATT: There are four pillars. They are smooth.
They appear to be either decorative or

01:48:57.737 --> 01:49:00.606
load-bearing, but there is nothing about them that
catches your eye. If you want to take a closer

01:49:00.606 --> 01:49:02.678
look, you can make an investigation check, if you
want.

01:49:02.678 --> 01:49:06.607
SAM: Is the ground dirt, gravel, or stone?

01:49:06.607 --> 01:49:07.953
MATT: Stone as well.

01:49:07.953 --> 01:49:08.891
DEBORAH: 12.

01:49:08.891 --> 01:49:11.148
MATT: Pretty solid and featureless.

01:49:11.148 --> 01:49:18.824
TALIESIN: The two corpses, what can we ascertain
about them? Are they wearing clothing?

01:49:18.824 --> 01:49:20.468
MATT: They are both wearing clothing.

01:49:20.468 --> 01:49:22.561
DEBORAH: Naked.

01:49:22.561 --> 01:49:26.137
TALIESIN: Nudists get trapped in here all the
time.

01:49:26.137 --> 01:49:33.332
MATT: There's not much dust on them. Which means
either it's fresh or not a lot of dust to have collected.

01:49:33.332 --> 01:49:35.267
LIAM: There's no entrances or exits?

01:49:35.267 --> 01:49:39.319
MATT: From what you can see, none. Make a medicine
check.

01:49:39.319 --> 01:49:42.115
LAURA: Does it smell like death in here?

01:49:42.115 --> 01:49:49.553
MATT: There's a faint aura or a faint scent, but
either these corpses do not emanate a lot of

01:49:49.553 --> 01:49:52.585
smell, or it has faded in time.

01:49:52.585 --> 01:50:00.796
DEBORAH: I send my Mage Hand out to move the blue
banner aside to see if there is anything behind there.

01:50:00.796 --> 01:50:02.832
MATT: Okay. Just to give you guys a visual
representation--

01:50:02.832 --> 01:50:04.789
SAM: Just to give us a visual.

01:50:04.789 --> 01:50:07.996
LAURA: Right. Definitely won't lead to anything.

01:50:07.996 --> 01:50:09.828
DEBORAH: For the kids at home.

01:50:09.828 --> 01:50:12.685
SAM: Guys, D&amp;D Beyond.

01:50:12.685 --> 01:50:14.676
LAURA: (singing) D&amp;D!

01:50:14.676 --> 01:50:25.855
SAM: Check your Twitters and Giphys for the gifs
that have already started pouring in. This seems legit.

01:50:25.855 --> 01:50:28.604
MATT: Placing yourselves where you would like to
be in here, if you don't mind telling me where

01:50:28.604 --> 01:50:29.735
you'd like to be placed.

01:50:29.735 --> 01:50:31.676
TRAVIS: Not in the middle, Matthew!

01:50:31.676 --> 01:50:35.424
TALIESIN: I want to be by the corpses. I rolled a
19.

01:50:35.424 --> 01:50:38.724
DEBORAH: I used my Mage Hand, so I need to be
here.

01:50:38.724 --> 01:50:43.349
TRAVIS: (singing) I want to be by the corpses.

01:50:43.349 --> 01:50:46.392
TALIESIN: That was not a sick beat.

01:50:46.392 --> 01:50:48.214
TRAVIS: Let it build.

01:50:48.214 --> 01:50:50.746
LAURA: That was not a sick beat.

01:50:50.746 --> 01:50:57.515
MATT: One here and one here.

01:50:57.515 --> 01:51:01.796
LAURA: They're not right next to each other. I
pictured a lover's embrace.

01:51:01.796 --> 01:51:09.599
TALIESIN: Do they look like violently ended, or do
they look like people who fell asleep and never

01:51:09.599 --> 01:51:10.940
got up?

01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:18.066
MATT: Their faces are twisted in a horrible
expression of ghastly terror or pain, but you

01:51:18.066 --> 01:51:21.565
don't see any wounds. Did you roll a medicine
check?

01:51:21.565 --> 01:51:22.720
TALIESIN: Yeah, 19.

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:25.675
MATT: Yeah, you don't see any wounds or any
gashes.

01:51:25.675 --> 01:51:28.632
TALIESIN: They definitely got a look like they saw
something wicked awful?

01:51:28.632 --> 01:51:32.552
MATT: Their last moments were probably pretty
terrifying. You moved aside the--

01:51:32.552 --> 01:51:35.008
DEBORAH: With my Mage Hand, from far away.

01:51:35.008 --> 01:51:35.670
MATT: The blue one?

01:51:35.670 --> 01:51:36.339
DEBORAH: Yes.

01:51:36.339 --> 01:51:43.669
MATT: Okay. As it pulls behind, it reveals to be a
statue that is embedded in the wall behind it. Up

01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:52.601
on hind legs with claws in front, you see a dragon
made of stone, carved, wings blending up into the

01:51:52.601 --> 01:51:58.538
stone behind it. Its mouth open, its eyes these
very bright sapphires embedded in its head.

01:51:58.538 --> 01:52:08.500
Immediately as it opens up, the mouth lights up
blue. Make a dexterity saving throw. And Caleb and Nott.

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.026
DEBORAH: I also have evasion.

01:52:10.026 --> 01:52:10.805
MATT: Correct.

01:52:10.805 --> 01:52:13.808
DEBORAH: Not good. Don't do it.

01:52:13.808 --> 01:52:14.835
MATT: What did you roll?

01:52:14.835 --> 01:52:16.625
DEBORAH: I rolled a ten.

01:52:16.625 --> 01:52:17.939
MATT: Okay, still half damage.

01:52:17.939 --> 01:52:18.956
LIAM: 13.

01:52:18.956 --> 01:52:20.060
MATT: Failure.

01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:21.161
SAM: 25.

01:52:21.161 --> 01:52:25.941
MATT: You take no damage, Nott, as you dodge away.
The rest of you watch as this bolt of blue energy

01:52:25.941 --> 01:52:34.867
fires outward as a thick beam of electrical energy
shoots across the room. It hits by and skims the

01:52:34.867 --> 01:52:41.140
front torso of Twiggy as she pulls out of the way.
You watch Caleb spin and take it straight to the

01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:44.950
chest as Nott ducks out of the way.

01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:50.568
LAURA: Is this still the same day? It is. Okay.

01:52:50.568 --> 01:52:52.463
SAM: But we have healed.

01:52:52.463 --> 01:52:53.265
LAURA: Yeah.

01:52:53.265 --> 01:52:58.106
MATT: Caleb, you take 18 points of lightning
damage. Twiggy, you take nine.

01:52:58.106 --> 01:53:03.846
TRAVIS: As Caleb flies backward, I'll summon the
falchion and take a defensive stance.

01:53:03.846 --> 01:53:04.943
MATT: Okay.

01:53:04.943 --> 01:53:08.561
DEBORAH: My hair stands on end a little bit from
the electricity.

01:53:08.561 --> 01:53:11.498
MATT: Okay. Also, make a concentration check.

01:53:11.498 --> 01:53:14.101
DEBORAH: A concentration?

01:53:14.101 --> 01:53:17.634
MATT: For Mage Hand; I believe Mage Hand is
concentration.

01:53:17.634 --> 01:53:20.196
DEBORAH: It's a cantrip.

01:53:20.196 --> 01:53:23.404
MATT: Oh, no, it lasts for a minute. I'm sorry,
you don't need to. It maintains itself. That's my bad.

01:53:23.404 --> 01:53:24.950
DEBORAH: That's okay.

01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:29.672
TRAVIS: Did the burst that came from the blue make
it all the way across the room to the green?

01:53:29.672 --> 01:53:32.137
MATT: It did. It went (crackle) across.

01:53:32.137 --> 01:53:34.672
TRAVIS: It just detonated on the other tapestry?

01:53:34.672 --> 01:53:39.065
MATT: It hit the tapestry and dissipated. The
electrical energy didn't seem to impact or hurt anything.

01:53:39.065 --> 01:53:42.294
DEBORAH: The Mage Hand'll drop the cover back in
front of that.

01:53:42.294 --> 01:53:44.532
MATT: It covers the statue.

01:53:44.532 --> 01:53:46.515
TALIESIN: Let's take a minute before we--

01:53:46.515 --> 01:53:48.153
SAM: Don't do that again!

01:53:48.153 --> 01:53:53.583
LAURA: I have an idea! What if we put on the red
cape and then it does something if the statue

01:53:53.583 --> 01:53:55.364
behind the red thing sees it?

01:53:55.364 --> 01:53:56.735
SAM: Oh! Halas' cape?

01:53:56.735 --> 01:53:58.336
DEBORAH: Do we have it?

01:53:58.336 --> 01:53:59.870
TRAVIS: In the haversack, right?

01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:01.137
LIAM: Yeah, I have it.

01:54:01.137 --> 01:54:02.263
LAURA: Put it on, or something.

01:54:02.263 --> 01:54:03.075
SAM: He's hurt!

01:54:03.075 --> 01:54:03.809
DEBORAH: I'm so sorry.

01:54:03.809 --> 01:54:04.828
LAURA: Caleb, are you okay?

01:54:04.828 --> 01:54:06.314
SAM: Yeah, Twiggy just hurt him.

01:54:06.314 --> 01:54:07.380
DEBORAH: I'm so sorry!

01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:09.224
TALIESIN: Just going to do a quick Cure Wounds.

01:54:09.224 --> 01:54:10.404
DEBORAH: Winning friends!

01:54:10.404 --> 01:54:14.977
TALIESIN: Just one. Oh, that's good! Take 13
points of healing.

01:54:14.977 --> 01:54:16.394
LIAM: Danke.

01:54:16.394 --> 01:54:18.766
TALIESIN: Let's take a second here.

01:54:18.766 --> 01:54:21.291
LAURA: Who wants to put on the red robe?

01:54:21.291 --> 01:54:23.157
TALIESIN: I think we should--

01:54:23.157 --> 01:54:24.934
TRAVIS: I'll do it.

01:54:24.934 --> 01:54:26.538
SAM: It's your ship.

01:54:26.538 --> 01:54:27.536
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:54:27.536 --> 01:54:30.360
TALIESIN: I think we should talk to the locals
before we do anything else.

01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:32.075
TRAVIS: Who are the locals?

01:54:32.075 --> 01:54:33.403
TALIESIN: Oh, these fellows.

01:54:33.403 --> 01:54:34.336
LAURA: The dead guys.

01:54:34.336 --> 01:54:36.594
TRAVIS: Oh! Yeah, forgot you can do that.

01:54:36.594 --> 01:54:43.109
TALIESIN: Oh, I can't pick. Somebody else pick. I
don't know.

01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:44.061
TRAVIS: Which one?

01:54:44.061 --> 01:54:45.193
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know.

01:54:45.193 --> 01:54:46.241
TRAVIS: The one closest to you.

01:54:46.241 --> 01:54:52.019
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay. That's level three, right?
Yep, there we are.

01:54:52.019 --> 01:54:55.399
MATT: Is anyone else adjusting their position, or
are you staying where you are?

01:54:55.399 --> 01:54:59.720
LAURA: I'm going to make sure I'm not in line with
any of the banners.

01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:01.127
TRAVIS: Yeah, ditto that shit.

01:55:01.127 --> 01:55:05.595
LAURA: I'm going to step wide. Ugh, I can't reach.
Sorry.

01:55:05.595 --> 01:55:07.417
LIAM: The lightning came out of here?

01:55:07.417 --> 01:55:09.735
MATT: Yeah. It went (crackling) through the
chamber.

01:55:09.735 --> 01:55:12.402
DEBORAH: I'll go with Jester, on the other side of
that.

01:55:12.402 --> 01:55:15.205
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do this, right back here.

01:55:15.205 --> 01:55:18.326
DEBORAH: Then I'll be here; I'll be next to that
pillar.

01:55:18.326 --> 01:55:22.484
SAM: Scoot me over somewhere, too, while you're up
there, Marisha.

01:55:22.484 --> 01:55:23.565
MATT: Where do you want to go?

01:55:23.565 --> 01:55:25.018
SAM: Just near Fjord. Boom.

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:29.381
MATT: All right. Caduceus, the one nearest to you,
you're casting--?

01:55:29.381 --> 01:55:31.703
TALIESIN: Speak With Dead.

01:55:31.703 --> 01:55:37.168
MATT: As you sit there for a second holding your
staff, your shield strapped over the arm, your

01:55:37.168 --> 01:55:44.015
hand goes down. You close your eyes and focus, and
the corpse on the ground staring off, its eyes

01:55:44.015 --> 01:55:53.945
dull and the pupils smoky and gray, breathes in
its chest, seems to inhale, and it holds the air

01:55:53.945 --> 01:55:55.800
there, awaiting your questions.

01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:06.930
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, friend. You have one more
task to perform before we can let you rest. What

01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:09.649
killed you?

01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:17.467
MATT: "The wailing creature."

01:56:17.467 --> 01:56:30.085
TALIESIN: The wailing creature. What color was the
curtain the wailing creature hid behind?

01:56:30.085 --> 01:56:34.882
MATT: "Onyx black."

01:56:34.882 --> 01:56:40.129
TALIESIN: Good to know. How did you end up here?

01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:42.584
TRAVIS: Yes! Thank you, Taliesin!

01:56:42.682 --> 01:56:52.519
MATT: "We had found an object and toyed with it."

01:56:52.519 --> 01:56:54.401
SAM: Just like us.

01:56:54.401 --> 01:56:57.710
LIAM: Did any of his friends get out?

01:56:57.710 --> 01:57:00.736
TALIESIN: What's the name of that--

01:57:00.736 --> 01:57:02.059
SAM: Halas?

01:57:02.059 --> 01:57:09.633
TALIESIN: What does the name Halas mean to you?

01:57:09.633 --> 01:57:11.958
MATT: "Nothing."

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:14.025
TALIESIN: Well, that's no help.

01:57:14.025 --> 01:57:15.797
MATT: Four questions; you've got one more.

01:57:15.797 --> 01:57:16.858
LAURA: Oh god!

01:57:16.858 --> 01:57:19.824
SAM: Did anyone escape?

01:57:19.824 --> 01:57:23.075
TALIESIN: Do you know how to get out of here?

01:57:23.075 --> 01:57:30.176
MATT: "No." That final bit of trapped air in the
lung escapes and it falls to stillness once more.

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:33.968
TALIESIN: I'm going to give him a little pop and
seed him for later.

01:57:33.968 --> 01:57:36.147
MATT: Okay, so you're casting Decompose on him?

01:57:36.147 --> 01:57:36.943
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

01:57:36.943 --> 01:57:37.952
DEBORAH: Nice trick!

01:57:37.952 --> 01:57:40.695
TALIESIN: Thank you. Well, that was a little
helpful.

01:57:40.695 --> 01:57:43.561
SAM: It was a lot helpful! So we know blue, bad,
black, bad--

01:57:43.561 --> 01:57:47.362
DEBORAH: Probably green and red bad.

01:57:47.362 --> 01:57:50.254
SAM: Well, maybe one of them is a good! Maybe one
of them's a way out of here!

01:57:50.254 --> 01:57:51.411
DEBORAH: Maybe.

01:57:51.411 --> 01:57:55.145
LAURA: You should put on the robe. Did you put on
the robe? I can help you put on the robe.

01:57:55.145 --> 01:57:57.448
TRAVIS: No, I'm trying to put it on. Does it fit?

01:57:57.448 --> 01:58:02.466
MATT: It's a little tight on you, but it fits.
You're slender for a half-orc.

01:58:02.466 --> 01:58:05.824
TRAVIS: I'm fucking fit, okay?

01:58:05.824 --> 01:58:09.078
MATT: You can be fit and slender.

01:58:09.078 --> 01:58:11.808
TALIESIN: Maybe they're all bad.

01:58:11.808 --> 01:58:13.789
LIAM: Hey man, you let strength be the dump stat.

01:58:13.789 --> 01:58:19.616
DEBORAH: We could stand out of the way and my Mage
Hand could open them all, if we felt like-- There

01:58:19.616 --> 01:58:21.602
could be--

01:58:21.602 --> 01:58:22.923
LAURA: The wailing creature could--

01:58:22.923 --> 01:58:24.610
DEBORAH: Yeah, it wouldn't matter where we stood.

01:58:24.610 --> 01:58:27.150
LAURA: Yeah, but he is in line with the wailing
creature.

01:58:27.150 --> 01:58:37.826
LIAM: I have an idea. I can make a magical hut
that nothing can pass through.

01:58:37.826 --> 01:58:42.075
TRAVIS: That is an excellent way to try and figure
out what the fuck's going on in here.

01:58:42.075 --> 01:58:48.873
LIAM: I am going to begin to take the minute to
cast Leomund's Tiny Hut in the center of the room.

01:58:48.873 --> 01:58:49.918
MATT: Okay.

01:58:49.918 --> 01:58:50.865
TRAVIS: An observation deck.

01:58:50.865 --> 01:58:52.074
DEBORAH: In the center of the room, okay.

01:58:52.074 --> 01:58:53.474
LAURA: Ooh, the center.

01:58:53.474 --> 01:58:55.946
MARISHA: Like one of those bomb shelter walls.

01:58:55.946 --> 01:59:00.145
LIAM: It's a ten-foot radius, and everyone is
allowed to enter and exit.

01:59:00.145 --> 01:59:04.152
MATT: A ten-foot radius would be a bit bigger than
that, so that would be the ten-foot radius.

01:59:04.152 --> 01:59:05.419
LAURA: Can we all fit inside of it?

01:59:05.419 --> 01:59:10.874
LIAM: Absolutely. But I have to stay in the center
of it where it is safe.

01:59:10.874 --> 01:59:13.360
SAM: But someone needs to step out of it in order
to trigger the other--

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:15.322
DEBORAH: Well, can I send Mage Hand through it?

01:59:15.322 --> 01:59:22.587
LIAM: You can stick your hand through the barrier
and cast Mage Hand and pull back in, yeah.

01:59:22.587 --> 01:59:24.617
MATT: So everyone is moving into it?

01:59:24.617 --> 01:59:30.744
LAURA: I want to stay, still, as much away from a
line-up as we-- like, in front of the things.

01:59:30.744 --> 01:59:33.211
MATT: There's not a whole lot of space there.

01:59:33.211 --> 01:59:37.116
TRAVIS: You know, it's just a thought, but if we
have to open two of these that are facing each

01:59:37.116 --> 01:59:40.447
other at the same time so they destroy each other,
we'll probably have to drop that down.

01:59:40.447 --> 01:59:43.270
LIAM: This is impervious to-- yeah.

01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:44.344
TRAVIS: We'll get there.

01:59:44.344 --> 01:59:46.558
LIAM: We'll get there. We can experiment because
this is impervious.

01:59:46.558 --> 01:59:47.618
TRAVIS: I like it.

01:59:47.618 --> 01:59:49.086
TALIESIN: So we already know what two of these
are.

01:59:49.086 --> 01:59:49.755
DEBORAH: Right.

01:59:49.755 --> 01:59:54.405
MARISHA: What if you unleash the wailing creature
and we have to deal with it?

01:59:54.405 --> 01:59:56.243
LIAM: It cannot come in here.

01:59:56.243 --> 01:59:57.883
TRAVIS: What about sound?

01:59:57.883 --> 02:00:00.962
DEBORAH: How long does it last?

02:00:00.962 --> 02:00:10.665
LIAM: Oh, hours. That is a good point, although I
have a decent supply of honeycomb. We could knead

02:00:10.665 --> 02:00:13.500
it up and make earplugs for ourselves.

02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:15.543
TRAVIS: That is really resourceful.

02:00:15.543 --> 02:00:16.919
DEBORAH: And I have gum.

02:00:16.919 --> 02:00:20.208
LIAM: That's just as good or better. You are
clever.

02:00:20.208 --> 02:00:22.402
DEBORAH: Yeah! Thank you!

02:00:22.402 --> 02:00:23.700
SAM: Sure.

02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:25.988
TRAVIS: Where did her gum come from?

02:00:25.988 --> 02:00:29.390
MARISHA: It's survival.

02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:31.850
SAM: Well, let's do some honeycomb, then.

02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:33.373
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:00:33.373 --> 02:00:35.767
MARISHA: I'll take the gum. I'm not proud.

02:00:35.767 --> 02:00:42.078
TALIESIN: I feel like I was told as a child not to
put things in my ears, but I guess I'm doing this.

02:00:42.078 --> 02:00:44.334
LAURA: I'm going to soften it up with my mouth.

02:00:44.334 --> 02:00:45.981
LIAM: Before and after, okay.

02:00:45.981 --> 02:00:48.762
TALIESIN: I wonder what's behind green.

02:00:48.762 --> 02:00:50.140
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:51.266
DEBORAH: Okay.

02:00:51.266 --> 02:00:52.059
TRAVIS: Do it.

02:00:52.059 --> 02:00:57.787
DEBORAH: All right, I'll sneak over to that side
so I can see it, and I'm going to put just my hand

02:00:57.787 --> 02:01:02.264
outside of the area of the hut.

02:01:02.264 --> 02:01:05.703
TRAVIS: You don't need that hand, you got another
one.

02:01:05.703 --> 02:01:07.527
DEBORAH: It has vocal components. Do I need to
lean my head out?

02:01:07.527 --> 02:01:11.199
MATT: Don't make this the second time I've taken a
hand of yours.

02:01:11.199 --> 02:01:14.001
DEBORAH: But my new hand is so cool!

02:01:14.001 --> 02:01:15.818
MATT: Sorry. So?

02:01:15.818 --> 02:01:21.572
DEBORAH: If there's a vocal component-- only I
have to be able to hear it-- do I need to stick my

02:01:21.572 --> 02:01:22.697
head out?

02:01:22.697 --> 02:01:25.548
MATT: As far as you know, it doesn't affect you in
a volume or noise way.

02:01:25.548 --> 02:01:32.295
DEBORAH: Okay. So I whisper something and I move
my hand and that silvery, spectral hand comes off,

02:01:32.295 --> 02:01:40.075
and it goes forward toward the green. I pull my
own hand back and get back into the space, and I

02:01:40.075 --> 02:01:43.478
tell it to push the green flag aside.

02:01:43.478 --> 02:01:52.617
MATT: You have to move over here, probably, to get
into range. As you pull back the green tapestry--

02:01:52.617 --> 02:01:56.970
LAURA: I'm going to crouch, even in the thing.

02:01:56.970 --> 02:02:06.217
MATT: You crouch down? Okay. As you pull it back,
you see a statue behind it that looks to be some

02:02:06.217 --> 02:02:16.513
horribly mutated humanoid creature. Its body is
bulbous and covered in sores, its neck is swollen

02:02:16.513 --> 02:02:25.608
like a toad's, its mouth and jaw open with rows of
teeth, all made of stone. As it pulls back, this

02:02:25.608 --> 02:02:32.546
gaseous green fume spews from its mouth that fills
the chamber around it. About half the chamber

02:02:32.546 --> 02:02:37.291
begins to fill with this before it dissipates, but
it does not cross the boundaries of the hut.

02:02:37.291 --> 02:02:39.757
TRAVIS: Ooh, shit.

02:02:39.757 --> 02:02:41.991
DEBORAH: Red?

02:02:41.991 --> 02:02:47.605
TALIESIN: Sound; a beam; there's a screech;
there's a gas.

02:02:47.605 --> 02:02:50.470
DEBORAH: Well, light, sound, gas.

02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:54.063
SAM: Smell? Sound? Vision?

02:02:54.063 --> 02:02:55.833
TALIESIN: I don't know what goes next.

02:02:55.833 --> 02:02:57.208
MATT: What are you doing next?

02:02:57.208 --> 02:02:58.081
DEBORAH: Should I try it?

02:02:58.081 --> 02:03:00.179
LAURA: Do the red! Maybe it's fire.

02:03:00.179 --> 02:03:06.890
DEBORAH: I move over to be in line with the red,
and I stick my hand out, and it flies out, the

02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:11.089
spectral hand. I pull back into the safety, and it
pushes aside the red.

02:03:11.089 --> 02:03:20.535
MATT: It pulls aside the red. Behind it, you see
emerge a wooden door of red-painted material and

02:03:20.535 --> 02:03:25.354
the similar symbol of Halas painted across the
surface.

02:03:25.354 --> 02:03:26.536
TRAVIS: Red doors are bad.

02:03:26.536 --> 02:03:27.337
SAM: That's the way out!

02:03:27.337 --> 02:03:30.955
DEBORAH: Should the Mage Hand try to open it, you
guys? I can send my hand to try and open it.

02:03:30.955 --> 02:03:34.676
LIAM: We are still safe in here. Yeah, I think
so.

02:03:34.676 --> 02:03:36.328
DEBORAH: Captain Fjord?

02:03:36.328 --> 02:03:37.411
TRAVIS: Proceed.

02:03:37.411 --> 02:03:44.857
DEBORAH: Sweet! I whisper, and I direct it a
little bit. It comes down, and it grabs a knob? A handle?

02:03:44.857 --> 02:03:46.256
MATT: There is a handle there.

02:03:46.256 --> 02:03:47.676
DEBORAH: A handle, and it's going to turn.

02:03:47.676 --> 02:03:50.089
MATT: (clicking) It's locked.

02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:53.935
LAURA: Hmm. Ooh! Fjord, look in your pockets!

02:03:53.935 --> 02:03:55.261
TRAVIS: Why?

02:03:55.261 --> 02:03:57.710
LAURA: Of the red robe! Look in the pockets of the
red robe!

02:03:57.726 --> 02:04:06.130
DEBORAH: I call it back to me. I pull out of my
purse a little set of tools on a ring, and I give

02:04:06.130 --> 02:04:11.852
it to the hand and whisper it off again to go see
if it can pick the lock.

02:04:11.852 --> 02:04:16.063
MATT: The hand hovers across. Roll an ability
check, adding your dexterity modifier and your

02:04:16.063 --> 02:04:17.706
proficiency modifier.

02:04:17.706 --> 02:04:21.533
DEBORAH: My thieves' tools? That's a 29.

02:04:21.533 --> 02:04:23.205
LAURA: Whoa!

02:04:24.055 --> 02:04:28.978
SAM: I don't have to do shit. I'm just going to
sit there, drinking.

02:04:30.769 --> 02:04:41.094
MATT: It takes a few minutes. This is an intricate
lock. As you watch the hand finish with the third

02:04:41.094 --> 02:04:49.705
tool that is being held between the mystical
pinkie, you hear a slight clink, like a spring

02:04:49.705 --> 02:05:01.237
snapped or moved. The front of the door here
bursts into flame, burning out in the area. It

02:05:01.237 --> 02:05:08.256
burns solid for a good 30 seconds. Surrounded by
flame, all of you are being lit by this. You're

02:05:08.256 --> 02:05:13.067
wincing from the heat you feel you should be
feeling, but it's all being held at bay by the

02:05:13.067 --> 02:05:19.507
hut's boundaries. Eventually, the flames die out,
the door, tapestry both untouched.

02:05:19.795 --> 02:05:23.345
DEBORAH: I pull the hand back to me, and I take my
keys, ow! Back in my pouch.

02:05:23.345 --> 02:05:25.252
MATT: Yeah, they're very hot.

02:05:25.252 --> 02:05:27.018
TRAVIS: Can I search the pockets of the red coat?

02:05:27.018 --> 02:05:29.279
MATT: Sure. Make an investigation check.

02:05:31.041 --> 02:05:32.952
TALIESIN: Feels a bit extreme.

02:05:34.152 --> 02:05:35.852
SAM: Deep pockets!

02:05:36.150 --> 02:05:37.536
LAURA: Natural one?

02:05:37.536 --> 02:05:39.434
TRAVIS: Seven.

02:05:39.434 --> 02:05:41.630
MATT: There are no pockets on the robe.

02:05:41.630 --> 02:05:44.462
TRAVIS: No pockets!

02:05:44.462 --> 02:05:47.373
SAM: That door is still closed?

02:05:47.373 --> 02:05:50.833
MATT: Yeah. It's a heavy cloak, if you will.

02:05:50.833 --> 02:05:54.505
SAM: So there's no way in or out, and every door
is bad.

02:05:54.505 --> 02:05:56.483
TRAVIS: Well, we haven't pulled the black curtain
back yet.

02:05:56.483 --> 02:05:58.660
SAM: Well, that was the wailing one. The guy said
it was the wailing one.

02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:00.763
LAURA: We should see what it is, though.

02:06:00.801 --> 02:06:07.415
LIAM: We have heard everything that happened
outside of this bubble. If it is wailing at us, I

02:06:07.415 --> 02:06:10.886
don't know what that would entail for us.

02:06:10.886 --> 02:06:14.483
TALIESIN: That says that the door is trapped, not
necessarily that the door is unopenable.

02:06:14.483 --> 02:06:17.480
LIAM: Yeah, that's correct. Nott, you could at
least give it a whirl.

02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:19.296
SAM: Give what a whirl?

02:06:19.296 --> 02:06:22.646
LIAM: Picking that lock. We are in here for
another seven hours and 40 minutes.

02:06:22.646 --> 02:06:25.955
SAM: Oh, I thought you picked that lock. The red
one?

02:06:25.955 --> 02:06:31.162
MATT: It triggered something, but you feel
confident.

02:06:31.162 --> 02:06:35.305
DEBORAH: I'll send the hand back out to try the
handle again.

02:06:35.305 --> 02:06:38.333
MATT: (click, door creaking) It opens up.

02:06:38.333 --> 02:06:40.011
LIAM: You've got to follow through.

02:06:40.011 --> 02:06:42.963
DEBORAH: Sorry guys, I'm a little absent-minded.

02:06:42.963 --> 02:06:45.278
TALIESIN: I mean, there's a lot going on right
now.

02:06:45.278 --> 02:06:47.082
SAM: We have a way out!

02:06:47.082 --> 02:06:49.618
LAURA: Should we just go out, then?

02:06:49.618 --> 02:06:54.052
TALIESIN: I'm going to double-check these bodies
for things before we go. If anyone wants to help

02:06:54.052 --> 02:06:55.541
me with an investigation check--

02:06:55.541 --> 02:06:57.203
SAM: I'll help you.

02:06:57.203 --> 02:06:59.175
DEBORAH: You want me to look? I'll go look!

02:06:59.175 --> 02:07:00.479
MATT: Go for it.

02:07:00.479 --> 02:07:01.726
DEBORAH: You're going to help me?

02:07:01.726 --> 02:07:02.908
TALIESIN: Sure.

02:07:03.202 --> 02:07:05.196
SAM: Great! I'm getting day drunk!

02:07:05.196 --> 02:07:06.342
DEBORAH: 27.

02:07:06.342 --> 02:07:11.807
MATT: Whew. You give a thorough pass. They are
picked clean. In fact, you find the belt on one of

02:07:11.807 --> 02:07:17.245
them seems to have been broken forcefully, and a
couple of pieces of leather that are pinched where

02:07:17.245 --> 02:07:22.357
a belt pouch may have been resting for a while.
Missing. Somebody has completely rolled these

02:07:22.357 --> 02:07:24.695
corpses and picked them clean already.

02:07:24.695 --> 02:07:26.410
DEBORAH: Sorry, buddy.

02:07:26.410 --> 02:07:30.600
TALIESIN: Seems that they were robbed before they
came in here. It's weird.

02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:33.182
DEBORAH: Or while they were in here.

02:07:33.182 --> 02:07:34.978
TALIESIN: Oh, that's even crazier.

02:07:34.978 --> 02:07:40.819
DEBORAH: Is there a way to tell if they were
robbed post-mortem or pre-mortem? I don't know!

02:07:40.819 --> 02:07:43.036
How do you tell that?

02:07:43.036 --> 02:07:44.787
MATT: Make a medicine check.

02:07:45.867 --> 02:07:48.233
MARISHA: This is some Bones shit.

02:07:48.907 --> 02:07:49.909
DEBORAH: 14.

02:07:49.921 --> 02:07:56.211
MATT: I mean, you glance around the areas. There's
not much to really pull from that type of

02:07:56.211 --> 02:07:59.337
material. You don't see any heavy bruising like
they were forcefully pulled from them while they

02:07:59.337 --> 02:08:02.186
were living, necessarily. It's hard to tell.

02:08:02.186 --> 02:08:09.655
SAM: Before we do anything, I'm going to whisper
to Jester: You know, I like Twiggy, but she picks

02:08:09.655 --> 02:08:17.323
all the locks, she does the Mage Hand thing, she
does the Hideous Laughter thing, she paints.

02:08:17.323 --> 02:08:19.140
LAURA: She makes a duplicate of herself.

02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:20.386
SAM: She has a cute animal.

02:08:20.386 --> 02:08:21.807
LAURA: And she likes chocolate!

02:08:21.807 --> 02:08:27.320
SAM: Are we being replaced? Is this some joke?

02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:29.736
LAURA: I mean, I don't know.

02:08:29.736 --> 02:08:32.195
SAM: Maybe they don't need us any more.

02:08:32.195 --> 02:08:34.714
LAURA: Maybe they brought her on purpose and they
don't want us anymore.

02:08:34.714 --> 02:08:35.813
SAM: Oh my god!

02:08:35.813 --> 02:08:37.074
LAURA: It's possible.

02:08:37.074 --> 02:08:38.968
SAM: Let's kill her.

02:08:38.968 --> 02:08:40.645
LAURA: Well...

02:08:40.645 --> 02:08:41.747
SAM: When the moment is right.

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:43.325
LAURA: Okay, okay.

02:08:43.325 --> 02:08:45.262
(laughter)

02:08:47.211 --> 02:08:48.968
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

02:08:48.968 --> 02:08:51.287
LIAM: I am placing Frumpkin outside of the
bubble.

02:08:51.287 --> 02:08:53.923
LAURA: He always sends Frumpkin in to die.

02:08:53.923 --> 02:08:56.044
LIAM: I am going to go look in the next room.

02:08:56.044 --> 02:08:57.420
DEBORAH: But I love that cat!

02:08:57.420 --> 02:08:59.939
MATT: Okay, roll a perception check for Frumpkin.

02:09:02.288 --> 02:09:03.724
LIAM: 13.

02:09:04.374 --> 02:09:10.220
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin goes up to the doorway and
looks. It is a dark hallway, no light. Frumpkin

02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:15.607
sees a little bit of light, but it's above, like
there seems to be an incline. It's above and to

02:09:15.607 --> 02:09:19.771
the right. It's not a straight, narrow hall. It
seems a little oddly angled.

02:09:19.771 --> 02:09:22.977
LIAM: You know, I could throw some light out
there, but I don't really want to announce our

02:09:22.977 --> 02:09:24.774
presence. What do you think we should do?

02:09:24.774 --> 02:09:26.507
LAURA: Does Frumpkin hear anyone?

02:09:26.507 --> 02:09:30.945
LIAM: He would have told me if he heard-- I can't
hear you.

02:09:30.945 --> 02:09:38.852
TALIESIN: I mean, we did just cause a giant
lightning thing. I feel like our presence has been announced.

02:09:38.852 --> 02:09:41.077
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're fine.

02:09:41.077 --> 02:09:42.964
TALIESIN: I'm going to light up my staff, at any
rate.

02:09:42.964 --> 02:09:44.591
LIAM: I come out of it.

02:09:44.591 --> 02:09:48.115
MATT: The light source on the staff now emanates
and the chamber is lit well.

02:09:48.115 --> 02:09:53.667
LIAM: I don't want to really announce our presence
if there's somebody out there. I don't know.

02:09:53.667 --> 02:09:55.808
MATT: This is open on this side.

02:09:55.808 --> 02:09:57.662
(oohing)

02:09:57.662 --> 02:09:59.344
DEBORAH: Fancy!

02:09:59.344 --> 02:10:01.047
MATT: I got to use that piece finally.

02:10:01.047 --> 02:10:03.488
TRAVIS: Well, we're not going anywhere in here.
Who wants to come with?

02:10:03.488 --> 02:10:04.832
LAURA: All of us.

02:10:04.832 --> 02:10:07.385
TALIESIN: Although we should probably have someone
check ahead, just for traps.

02:10:07.385 --> 02:10:09.730
DEBORAH: Ooh! I'm sneaky sneaky! Unless you want
to do it.

02:10:09.730 --> 02:10:19.532
SAM: No. You just go. No, it's fine, you do it.
Nope, you've got it. I'm fine.

02:10:24.691 --> 02:10:27.206
Have fun. Tell me how it goes.

02:10:27.502 --> 02:10:29.152
TRAVIS: Jester, Nott, y'all okay?

02:10:29.152 --> 02:10:30.614
SAM: and LAURA: We're fine.

02:10:30.614 --> 02:10:32.843
SAM: We're fine, Fjord. Everything's fine.

02:10:32.843 --> 02:10:34.777
LAURA: Don't worry about us.

02:10:34.777 --> 02:10:37.177
TRAVIS: They just turn on you that fast.

02:10:37.177 --> 02:10:39.369
MARISHA: I don't-- I think-- We'll talk later.

02:10:39.369 --> 02:10:40.940
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:42.862
LIAM: Caleb says nothing.

02:10:42.862 --> 02:10:45.747
TALIESIN: Nope.

02:10:46.048 --> 02:10:50.266
DEBORAH: In fact, Twiggy's not even really going
to wait. She starts to chase the cat. She wants to

02:10:50.266 --> 02:10:52.139
go see the cat and pet the cat.

02:10:52.139 --> 02:10:54.747
MATT: Okay, so Twiggy leaves the radius and starts
heading towards the far end of the room.

02:10:54.747 --> 02:10:57.056
DEBORAH: I'm going to sneakily do it, though.

02:10:57.056 --> 02:10:58.665
MATT: All right, roll a stealth check.

02:10:59.806 --> 02:11:01.048
DEBORAH: 17.

02:11:01.048 --> 02:11:05.610
MATT: Good to know. What are the rest of you
doing? You watch as Twiggy just leaves and starts

02:11:05.610 --> 02:11:07.034
heading towards the door.

02:11:07.034 --> 02:11:09.035
SAM: Oh, now we have to go. We can't let her die.

02:11:09.035 --> 02:11:10.223
LAURA: We should follow her.

02:11:10.223 --> 02:11:11.631
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll follow Twiggy.

02:11:11.631 --> 02:11:16.916
LIAM: I'm going to watch everyone safely go to the
door and not get killed, and then drop the bubble.

02:11:16.916 --> 02:11:22.503
LAURA: I walk behind Fjord and I cast Blessing of
the Trickster when I touch your back.

02:11:22.503 --> 02:11:24.258
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester.

02:11:24.258 --> 02:11:25.995
LIAM: It would stay there, yeah.

02:11:25.995 --> 02:11:28.214
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we'll know it's there, just in
case.

02:11:28.214 --> 02:11:33.699
MATT: All right. As everyone finds their way to
the door safely, you feel the moment to leave the field--

02:11:33.699 --> 02:11:35.457
LIAM: Oh yeah, if I leave, it's gone.

02:11:35.457 --> 02:11:37.118
TALIESIN: Oh, well then never mind.

02:11:37.118 --> 02:11:38.797
MATT: So the hut vanishes. Spell's expended.

02:11:38.797 --> 02:11:40.777
LIAM: Hightail it out of this fucking room!

02:11:40.777 --> 02:11:42.764
TRAVIS: That was well used, my man.

02:11:42.764 --> 02:11:45.622
MATT: You guys exit and make your way into the
hallway. The hallway itself drops temperature

02:11:45.622 --> 02:11:52.008
dramatically. It's similar to the space that you
guys were in last time. You feel for the edges and

02:11:52.008 --> 02:11:59.943
there's no real shape or texture to it. It's just
solid. It feels almost like stone, but not quite.

02:11:59.943 --> 02:12:11.958
It's hard to place. As you're stepping into the
chamber, I would say Nott and Fjord, you both get

02:12:11.958 --> 02:12:18.752
just a hint of vertigo. You glance and you take a
step into the hallway and it's an incline. You

02:12:18.752 --> 02:12:22.991
look up and you can see the light. It's hard to
make out, but you see a faint bit of light at the

02:12:22.991 --> 02:12:26.283
end of it, maybe a hundred or so feet ahead of
you.

02:12:26.283 --> 02:12:29.287
SAM: Vertigo just from the shape of the room?

02:12:29.287 --> 02:12:35.115
MATT: Just like stepping into the room and having
no real idea of where the walls and ceiling and

02:12:35.115 --> 02:12:38.806
floor are. It just looks like a black shape and
you're feeling some walls, but they're a little

02:12:38.806 --> 02:12:44.393
rounded. It's a strange aspect to this hallway.

02:12:44.393 --> 02:12:46.848
LAURA: Does the floor seem rounded, too?

02:12:46.848 --> 02:12:49.422
MATT: No, the floor just seems like a steady
incline.

02:12:49.422 --> 02:12:52.232
DEBORAH: We don't see light or anything at the end
of it?

02:12:52.232 --> 02:12:57.904
MATT: You see the end of the tunnel, but you can't
make out what's on the other side. It's too far.

02:12:58.194 --> 02:13:01.328
SAM: Can you make light? Is anyone? We need light.

02:13:01.328 --> 02:13:02.964
TALIESIN: I was making light.

02:13:02.964 --> 02:13:04.863
LIAM: With your staff, yeah?

02:13:04.863 --> 02:13:10.021
MATT: As Caduceus steps in with the staff, the
light seems to be crushed down to where you can

02:13:10.021 --> 02:13:14.641
see the faint bit of it there, but there's
something about this hallway that's swallowing the

02:13:14.641 --> 02:13:19.949
light or at least compressing it to where it's not
giving off much of a radius while you are standing in it.

02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:24.736
SAM: That's weird. Do we press ahead?

02:13:25.022 --> 02:13:26.411
TALIESIN: I mean.

02:13:26.685 --> 02:13:28.614
DEBORAH: No other way to go.

02:13:28.614 --> 02:13:30.972
TALIESIN: Can you see anything, Beau?

02:13:30.972 --> 02:13:40.850
MARISHA: That's what I was going to ask. It's a
forceful darkness and looking at Fjord get

02:13:40.850 --> 02:13:46.300
nauseous, does this remind me of any ghostly
presence that I experienced before?

02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:48.569
MATT: Not necessarily, but make a perception check
for me.

02:13:48.569 --> 02:13:50.927
LIAM: Do I recognize it as an obvious arcane
effect?

02:13:50.927 --> 02:13:52.890
MATT: Make an arcana check.

02:13:52.890 --> 02:13:54.512
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:13:54.512 --> 02:13:56.283
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:13:56.283 --> 02:13:58.370
MARISHA: 11.

02:13:58.370 --> 02:14:06.249
MATT: You can't make out much detail beyond the
end of the hallway. You, however, there's

02:14:06.249 --> 02:14:11.946
something about this that feels extraplanar.
Meaning the end of this doorway, whatever's at the

02:14:11.946 --> 02:14:17.525
other end, is being tethered by something that's
not really material space. You don't know what

02:14:17.525 --> 02:14:20.227
distance you're traveling between these two
objects.

02:14:20.227 --> 02:14:27.078
LIAM: Okay, I relay this to the group. We jumped
dimensions to get here, and whatever is laying

02:14:27.078 --> 02:14:32.765
before is not a hallway. In a way it is, but not
the traditional sense.

02:14:32.765 --> 02:14:34.731
SAM: But it might even be the way back out.

02:14:34.731 --> 02:14:35.852
LIAM: It might be, yeah.

02:14:35.852 --> 02:14:38.283
TRAVIS: As we turn around and look at the door
that we came back through, are there any markings

02:14:38.283 --> 02:14:40.169
above the door or around it?

02:14:40.169 --> 02:14:41.925
MATT: Perception check.

02:14:41.925 --> 02:14:44.593
TALIESIN: I'm going to roll Eyes of the Grave,
too, just to see if anything--

02:14:44.593 --> 02:14:46.867
TRAVIS: 20! No. 19.

02:14:46.867 --> 02:14:54.045
MATT: No. In fact, it's weird because the doorway
itself is this well carved inlaid beautiful door.

02:14:54.045 --> 02:14:58.102
As soon as you step into the hallway and look at
the opposite end, the hallway is just flush with

02:14:58.102 --> 02:15:06.396
the exterior of it and seems to curve out into the
rest of the hallway. It seems intentionally placed

02:15:06.396 --> 02:15:12.780
to match perfectly, but has a natural feel to its
shape. It's weird.

02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:16.050
LIAM: You said we can see the end of this
passageway, but not what's beyond it.

02:15:16.050 --> 02:15:17.801
MATT: Correct.

02:15:17.801 --> 02:15:19.842
TALIESIN: I'm rolling Eyes of the Grave. Just for
the hell of it.

02:15:19.842 --> 02:15:22.331
MATT: Right. Nothing comes up.

02:15:22.331 --> 02:15:23.731
SAM: Well, Twiggy?

02:15:23.731 --> 02:15:24.870
DEBORAH: I'm happy to keep going.

02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:25.783
SAM: All right.

02:15:25.783 --> 02:15:27.162
MATT: Marching order, please?

02:15:27.162 --> 02:15:28.267
DEBORAH: I'll be in first.

02:15:28.267 --> 02:15:30.965
TRAVIS: Twiggy, 50 feet behind everyone else.

02:15:30.965 --> 02:15:32.326
MATT: Who's after Twiggy?

02:15:32.326 --> 02:15:33.738
DEBORAH: I'm skipping.

02:15:33.738 --> 02:15:35.603
SAM: I'll go after Twiggy.

02:15:35.603 --> 02:15:37.460
MATT: Nott and Twiggy. Who's after Nott?

02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:39.261
LAURA: I'll go after Nott.

02:15:39.261 --> 02:15:40.602
TRAVIS: I'll go after Jester.

02:15:40.602 --> 02:15:42.232
MARISHA: I'll be after Fjord.

02:15:42.232 --> 02:15:43.962
TALIESIN: I'll be after Beau.

02:15:43.962 --> 02:15:45.559
MATT: Caleb in the back.

02:15:45.559 --> 02:15:49.350
SAM: Always. Hey, we're sort of in size order!

02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:53.320
LAURA: Hey Caleb! You know in haunted houses a lot
of time they attack the person in the back.

02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:55.224
TALIESIN: I'm paying attention.

02:15:55.224 --> 02:15:57.782
DEBORAH: I'm skipping stealthily.

02:15:57.782 --> 02:16:00.013
TALIESIN: (singing) Tiptoe through the tulips.

02:16:00.013 --> 02:16:02.015
DEBORAH: Like Bugs Bunny.

02:16:02.015 --> 02:16:05.897
LAURA: No, that's a really creepy song from,
that's from Insidious.

02:16:05.897 --> 02:16:15.281
MATT: You continue along this hallway, walking. It
takes you a moment to realize, but as you're

02:16:15.281 --> 02:16:20.775
moving forward, the light seems to turn. Like
whatever this source is, the light shifts

02:16:20.775 --> 02:16:25.746
slightly. Like whatever source is there seems to
have some sort of movement. As you're paying

02:16:25.746 --> 02:16:30.389
attention and the closer you get to it, you begin
to see it's like a flickering of firelight, there's a

02:16:30.389 --> 02:16:36.835
flame-based light source within whatever this next
area is, but it seems to be rotating. You begin to

02:16:37.143 --> 02:16:44.132
make out shapes, vaguely, of things within that
room, but it's rotating as you walk. It takes a

02:16:44.132 --> 02:16:50.408
moment for you all to realize that this chamber,
you're spiraling around it, but there's no change

02:16:50.408 --> 02:16:59.082
to your sense of gravity, but it a corkscrew
movement.

02:16:59.082 --> 02:17:00.460
LAURA: Whoa, that's freaky.

02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:01.788
TRAVIS: (vomiting)

02:17:01.788 --> 02:17:05.109
(laughter)

02:17:05.109 --> 02:17:13.815
MATT: Eventually, you come to the end of the
hallway. Inside it appears to be a warm interior.

02:17:13.815 --> 02:17:19.468
It's a crafted den or study of some kind, but the
angle you're at as you come to the end of it is a

02:17:19.468 --> 02:17:26.679
heavy steep angle. You see all these bookshelves
and a desk across the chamber and there are

02:17:26.679 --> 02:17:32.470
candelabras in there, they're all this harsh
angle, but they're not sliding, they're all held

02:17:32.470 --> 02:17:35.150
in place by something.

02:17:35.150 --> 02:17:36.365
TALIESIN: Or we are.

02:17:36.365 --> 02:17:38.703
LAURA: By gravity!

02:17:38.703 --> 02:17:42.112
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and use Thaumaturgy
through the door to see if I can affect the flame

02:17:42.112 --> 02:17:43.790
before we enter.

02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:46.964
MATT: Okay. You cast Thaumaturgy, no effect.

02:17:46.964 --> 02:17:49.171
TALIESIN: Well, that's weird.

02:17:49.171 --> 02:17:51.231
DEBORAH: It's in front?

02:17:51.231 --> 02:17:53.450
TALIESIN: We're not in there yet.

02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:56.629
DEBORAH: The flames we see are between us.

02:17:56.629 --> 02:18:00.199
MATT: The flames you see are inside the chamber,
and you haven't entered the chamber yet. The

02:18:00.199 --> 02:18:01.842
Thaumaturgy doesn't seem to--

02:18:01.842 --> 02:18:03.493
DEBORAH: But are they in the way of us entering
the chamber?

02:18:03.497 --> 02:18:04.566
MATT: No.

02:18:04.566 --> 02:18:05.622
DEBORAH: Oh, okay.

02:18:05.622 --> 02:18:08.812
TALIESIN: No, I was just curious if the magic
would follow through, apparently not, or whatever

02:18:08.812 --> 02:18:11.797
is in there is not real. I don't know.

02:18:11.797 --> 02:18:13.685
LAURA: Can we see any movement outside the
flames?

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:15.592
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:18:15.592 --> 02:18:17.524
SAM: Come on, Jessie.

02:18:17.524 --> 02:18:20.108
LAURA: Oh, well, 11, no.

02:18:20.108 --> 02:18:23.056
MATT: No movement beyond just the slow movement of
flames.

02:18:23.056 --> 02:18:25.879
MARISHA: Is there any scripture or writing on
the--?

02:18:25.879 --> 02:18:27.553
MATT: In the interior of the hallway?

02:18:27.553 --> 02:18:29.439
MARISHA: Yeah, to like enter this door.

02:18:29.439 --> 02:18:31.361
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:18:33.944 --> 02:18:36.272
MARISHA: Natural 20.

02:18:36.553 --> 02:18:42.735
MATT: Looking around the edge of the hall, the
ending, you don't see any script or symbols.

02:18:42.735 --> 02:18:48.584
Looking inside the chamber, though, as you get
close and peer within, this is definitely a study

02:18:48.584 --> 02:18:53.365
of some kind. There are bookshelves upon
bookshelves that round different areas. You can

02:18:53.365 --> 02:18:58.383
see a desk on the far end with a chair there. You
don't see anybody in it. Across from where this

02:18:58.383 --> 02:19:04.609
desk is, you get close and push and past Twiggy
and Nott to look inside. This is a tall chamber,

02:19:04.609 --> 02:19:10.515
it's maybe 70 or 60 foot tall. Taller almost than
it is wide. On the opposite end of the desk, above

02:19:10.515 --> 02:19:16.449
this large collection of bookshelves, there is a
heavy stained glass window that's about 30 or 40

02:19:16.449 --> 02:19:20.880
feet tall, and about 40 to 50 feet wide.

02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:24.187
MARISHA: Is there any image in the stained glass?

02:19:24.187 --> 02:19:29.467
MATT: There is no light source behind it. You can
see the stained glass and that there are colors to

02:19:29.467 --> 02:19:33.872
it, but there's nothing behind, no daylight to
really make it clear from this distance. You'd

02:19:34.153 --> 02:19:35.444
have to get closer.

02:19:35.444 --> 02:19:37.711
DEBORAH: Do we see any other exits in this tower,
this chamber?

02:19:37.711 --> 02:19:40.416
MATT: Not from where you're standing. But you guys
still have not entered the chamber.

02:19:40.416 --> 02:19:42.974
LAURA: Should we do it stealthily?

02:19:42.974 --> 02:19:44.517
SAM: Yes.

02:19:44.517 --> 02:19:47.261
MARISHA: I think we're about to enter into
someone's study.

02:19:47.261 --> 02:19:49.665
LAURA: I'm going to case Pass Without a Trace on
all of us.

02:19:49.665 --> 02:19:53.682
MATT: So everyone gets plus ten to their stealth
check. I'd like everyone to roll a stealth check

02:19:53.682 --> 02:19:55.296
for me, please.

02:19:57.405 --> 02:19:58.676
TRAVIS: 21.

02:19:58.676 --> 02:20:01.170
MATT: Beau?

02:20:01.170 --> 02:20:02.368
MARISHA: 34.

02:20:02.368 --> 02:20:03.299
LIAM: 15.

02:20:03.299 --> 02:20:05.056
SAM: 32.

02:20:05.056 --> 02:20:06.125
LAURA: 17.

02:20:06.125 --> 02:20:07.280
DEBORAH: 20.

02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:08.911
TALIESIN: 24.

02:20:08.911 --> 02:20:13.157
MATT: Overall, pretty good stealth scores. You
feel pretty confident that as you one by one enter

02:20:13.157 --> 02:20:20.214
the chamber, bracing yourself to slide down with
the curved floor, and you stumble and trip as you

02:20:20.214 --> 02:20:26.285
enter because, as soon as you step in, your whole
perspective shifts and gravity is as it should be

02:20:26.285 --> 02:20:31.568
in that chamber. You all step in at an odd angle
and have to catch yourself as you have to reorient

02:20:31.568 --> 02:20:33.636
yourself in an instant.

02:20:33.636 --> 02:20:36.960
LIAM: Like stepping off a moving sidewalk at the
airport, but way worse.

02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:38.202
MATT: Yes.

02:20:38.202 --> 02:20:40.153
LAURA: That was a neat trick.

02:20:40.153 --> 02:20:42.091
MATT: As you all step in the chamber, let me get a
visual reference.

02:20:42.091 --> 02:20:44.223
(cheering)

02:20:44.223 --> 02:20:46.124
TALIESIN: So many toys today.

02:20:46.124 --> 02:20:52.140
SAM: The Raven and the Rook is a thing that I
don't have any information about.

02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:54.813
LAURA: They make badass notebooks!

02:20:54.813 --> 02:20:57.367
LIAM: Ring based.

02:20:57.367 --> 02:20:59.875
TALIESIN: Hey, oh!

02:20:59.875 --> 02:21:02.887
(oohing)

02:21:02.887 --> 02:21:04.667
SAM: Look at all those books!

02:21:04.667 --> 02:21:07.817
LAURA: Whoa! There's a ladder, you guys!

02:21:07.817 --> 02:21:09.245
DEBORAH: We like ladders.

02:21:09.245 --> 02:21:11.330
TALIESIN: I love a good ladder.

02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:14.100
MATT: Pushing into this chamber, this door is
already open.

02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:16.046
LAURA: Ooh! A door that works!

02:21:16.046 --> 02:21:22.743
MATT: You guys all step into the interior of this
den of some kind.

02:21:22.743 --> 02:21:26.228
TRAVIS: I'm not looking at your notes, I'm just
looking through the wall.

02:21:26.228 --> 02:21:27.747
MATT: It's fine.

02:21:27.747 --> 02:21:29.414
LAURA: Where's the fireplace? Is it straight
across?

02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:33.304
MATT: There's no fireplace, but there are
candelabras throughout the chamber that give a

02:21:33.304 --> 02:21:37.578
light source that flickers throughout the
interior. This is all bookcases, these are

02:21:37.578 --> 02:21:41.847
bookcases, these are bookcases, these are
bookcases, this is a closed bookcase. There's a

02:21:41.847 --> 02:21:46.360
small desk here and a large desk here and the
stained glass window stands up there.

02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:50.380
LAURA: Those books look like you could remove them
and play with them.

02:21:50.380 --> 02:21:52.723
TRAVIS: Caleb passes out.

02:21:52.723 --> 02:21:55.016
LIAM: Nosebleed.

02:21:55.858 --> 02:21:59.284
TALIESIN: I'm going to try the candelabra again
see if I can get those flames a little brighter.

02:21:59.284 --> 02:22:05.406
MATT: Once you start, all of the flames flicker
brighter causing deeper shadows across the chamber.

02:22:05.406 --> 02:22:08.239
TALIESIN: I'll reel them back in. All right,
that's good to know.

02:22:08.239 --> 02:22:10.827
DEBORAH: You say now we see a door and it's open?

02:22:10.827 --> 02:22:12.938
MATT: That's the door you came through.

02:22:12.938 --> 02:22:14.890
SAM: But there's no other doors in this room?

02:22:14.890 --> 02:22:17.560
MATT: Make a perception check. You guys entered
from that side.

02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:20.775
SAM: I will look for a door. That's cocked. Six.

02:22:20.775 --> 02:22:22.369
LAURA: That wasn't cocked.

02:22:22.369 --> 02:22:24.870
MATT: It looks pretty solid.

02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:26.760
TRAVIS: You say the stained glass window was on
which wall?

02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:27.992
MATT: This wall here.

02:22:27.992 --> 02:22:29.591
TRAVIS: Gotcha. Thank you.

02:22:29.591 --> 02:22:32.581
MATT: There's a ladder over there as well. Looks
like these are all set aside for climbing and

02:22:32.581 --> 02:22:34.227
getting higher.

02:22:34.227 --> 02:22:36.516
TRAVIS: I'll climb up the ladder and get just
under the stained glass window.

02:22:36.516 --> 02:22:38.087
MATT: Okay.

02:22:38.087 --> 02:22:40.926
TRAVIS: Can I see through the glass or at the
glass or is it above me?

02:22:40.926 --> 02:22:46.050
MATT: No, you can see through it. It starts maybe
six inches off where that platform starts and then

02:22:46.050 --> 02:22:56.398
continues up for the next 40 or so feet. Looking
through, it is darkness, void, a lack of light.

02:22:56.398 --> 02:23:00.616
The only color you're able to make out is what the
candlelight from the inside of the chamber is

02:23:00.616 --> 02:23:03.739
enabling you to see from the inside, from this
side.

02:23:03.739 --> 02:23:10.464
TALIESIN: I'm going to maybe throw some
illumination up so we can see the window a bit better.

02:23:10.746 --> 02:23:16.325
MATT: Okay. As you all step into the middle of the
chamber to look at this stained glass window above you--

02:23:16.325 --> 02:23:19.254
LAURA: We should have checked for traps and stuff,
you guys.

02:23:19.254 --> 02:23:23.833
TALIESIN: Yeah. I was going to say, I was actually
thinking about getting up. I would like that, that

02:23:23.833 --> 02:23:25.623
weird corner ladder.

02:23:25.623 --> 02:23:26.701
MATT: Over here?

02:23:26.701 --> 02:23:28.134
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:23:28.134 --> 02:23:29.897
MATT: Sure. You place yourselves where you want to
be.

02:23:29.897 --> 02:23:31.605
TRAVIS: You and your damn loft positions,
Taliesin.

02:23:31.605 --> 02:23:35.049
TALIESIN: I like a good loft position. Since I was
a kid, my favorite thing.

02:23:35.049 --> 02:23:39.363
MATT: As there's more light in the chamber, you
can see now, above this desk there is a

02:23:39.363 --> 02:23:46.758
12-foot-tall, six-foot-wide picture frame. In the
picture frame, from the side angle, it has no

02:23:46.758 --> 02:23:54.925
image. As you step into the center, an image comes
into shape. You see a tall, ten- to 12-foot-tall

02:23:54.925 --> 02:24:02.755
portrait of a man: thin, of light brown skin, long
dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders, a very

02:24:02.755 --> 02:24:06.420
thinly-groomed chin beard that falls to a point
three or four inches below-- it's a very succinct

02:24:06.420 --> 02:24:11.239
point-- wearing a red robe with gold trim.

02:24:11.609 --> 02:24:13.849
LAURA: Does he have a ring on?

02:24:14.114 --> 02:24:19.836
MATT: He is wearing a handful of rings on his
hands. Billowing sleeves folded across his lap.

02:24:19.836 --> 02:24:25.786
His eyes are a piercing amber-yellow color, and
his lip curls ever so slightly into a knowing smile.

02:24:25.786 --> 02:24:28.840
DEBORAH: He doesn't look like Sir Cadigan, does
he?

02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:30.028
MATT: No.

02:24:30.028 --> 02:24:32.461
LAURA: Okay, that's where I was going. What about
a green ring, though? Does he have a green ring?

02:24:32.461 --> 02:24:34.131
TALIESIN: Can we see his feet?

02:24:34.131 --> 02:24:36.886
MATT: No. It's lap up.

02:24:36.886 --> 02:24:40.003
LAURA: Wait, describe him. Say him again.

02:24:40.003 --> 02:24:42.621
SAM: Do all of it again.

02:24:42.621 --> 02:24:47.447
MATT: A tall, thin man of light brown skin, with
long, dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders, a

02:24:47.447 --> 02:24:51.710
very thinly-groomed chin beard that falls to a
point about three inches below his chin, wearing a

02:24:52.009 --> 02:24:56.363
red robe with gold trim, with billowing sleeves
that fold across his lap. His eyes are a piercing

02:24:56.363 --> 02:25:01.719
amber yellow. His lips curl ever so slightly into
a knowing smile. There you go.

02:25:01.966 --> 02:25:03.280
LAURA: And he's got lots of rings on.

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:05.469
MATT: Yeah, he's got some intricate rings on his
fingers.

02:25:05.469 --> 02:25:08.074
SAM: He's wearing a red robe, you said?

02:25:08.074 --> 02:25:15.496
MATT: Yes. It looks almost the same coloration,
the same deep red, the same gold trim.

02:25:15.496 --> 02:25:18.585
LAURA: Oh look! I bet it's that guy! That's his
robe!

02:25:18.585 --> 02:25:19.598
TRAVIS: What's that?

02:25:19.598 --> 02:25:20.942
LAURA: He's thin.

02:25:20.942 --> 02:25:23.574
TRAVIS: Ah! Ah!

02:25:23.574 --> 02:25:28.724
DEBORAH: Guys, I really want to know what's in the
closed cabinet. Can I go look?

02:25:28.724 --> 02:25:32.305
TALIESIN: I would check for things, but.

02:25:32.305 --> 02:25:34.507
DEBORAH: Should I use my fancy hand again?

02:25:34.507 --> 02:25:37.853
LIAM: I think both of you should be taking a look
around in this moment.

02:25:37.853 --> 02:25:40.692
MATT: While that's happening, the stained glass
window, now that you have light that's

02:25:40.692 --> 02:25:42.278
illuminating it--

02:25:42.278 --> 02:25:43.549
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:25:43.806 --> 02:25:49.398
MATT: There is no backlight, so it's just the
light that you have on it right there. It shows

02:25:49.398 --> 02:25:56.218
clusters of different colored circles and discs
arranged in a strange, tethered pattern. You see

02:25:56.365 --> 02:26:00.455
different colored discs, different sizes and
colorations, that are laid into this with

02:26:00.455 --> 02:26:07.881
fragments of dark blues and grays in between. They
are all tethered by these silver threads and

02:26:07.881 --> 02:26:18.163
various tangled-- it looks like a crazed
synesthesia equation, if you will. Anybody who's

02:26:18.163 --> 02:26:20.590
trained in arcana or history, go ahead and roll.

02:26:20.590 --> 02:26:22.708
TRAVIS: Okay then.

02:26:22.708 --> 02:26:24.484
LIAM: The worst roll.

02:26:24.484 --> 02:26:26.920
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:29.807
TRAVIS: 15.

02:26:31.734 --> 02:26:33.281
MARISHA: 15.

02:26:33.482 --> 02:26:41.282
MATT: Okay. This arrangement, you begin to make
out, is a layout of the planes, the transitive

02:26:41.282 --> 02:26:46.294
planes of the Ethereal and the Astral between the
realms. You see these clouds of gray and light

02:26:46.294 --> 02:26:53.017
blue that mingle and create a Venn diagram where
everything overlaps on top of. They act as the

02:26:53.017 --> 02:26:59.237
threads that hold these things together and
connect them in between. The inner planes showing

02:26:59.237 --> 02:27:03.722
the elemental chaos where the primordial elements
were ordered into following the Founding of

02:27:03.722 --> 02:27:10.434
Exandria. You can see where the flaming sphere is
placed here, and there is the water, and the wind,

02:27:10.434 --> 02:27:13.829
and the earth. That is the scattering of these
inner planes.

02:27:13.829 --> 02:27:16.110
DEBORAH: Is there a You Are Here sticker?

02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:17.750
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:19.924
MARISHA: That's actually, yes.

02:27:19.924 --> 02:27:24.685
MATT: The outer planes, where the realms where the
divine exist, are scattered and connected, all

02:27:24.685 --> 02:27:29.733
surrounding the Material Plane on the outer side.
What you both notice, two things are off about

02:27:29.733 --> 02:27:37.878
this. One, there's no Divine Gate shown here. In
this whole layout, there is no reference. Most

02:27:37.878 --> 02:27:45.975
maps or sketches or historical designs of this
type of a layout contains the Divine Gate because

02:27:45.975 --> 02:27:50.305
that was a major event that happened after the
Calamity and separated all of the gods from the

02:27:50.305 --> 02:27:51.431
mortal planes.

02:27:51.431 --> 02:27:52.904
LIAM and LAURA: This is old.

02:27:52.904 --> 02:27:55.018
LIAM: Old, just like the device.

02:27:55.018 --> 02:28:02.701
MATT: You get the sense this was designed before
the Divine Gate was ever created. Number two,

02:28:02.701 --> 02:28:08.590
there is an additional shape. Smaller than the
rest. A tiny, ruby-like circle that floats in the

02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:15.423
Astral Sea, that is not tethered to anything, and
seems to not really fit within your understanding

02:28:15.423 --> 02:28:17.479
of the cosmos.

02:28:19.019 --> 02:28:20.854
TRAVIS: A small ruby circle?

02:28:20.854 --> 02:28:24.338
MATT: Like the same color. Like the color of a
ruby.

02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:26.862
SAM: A ruby in the Astral Sea?

02:28:26.862 --> 02:28:29.538
MATT and LAURA: Aww.

02:28:29.538 --> 02:28:32.475
TRAVIS: Does it blink, shine, shimmer, move?

02:28:32.475 --> 02:28:36.283
MATT: No, it's just the same type of material as
everything else. It's the glass the window's made

02:28:36.283 --> 02:28:37.698
out of.

02:28:37.698 --> 02:28:44.042
MARISHA: And where is that amongst the planes, the
little ruby amongst the sea? Is it in between two

02:28:44.042 --> 02:28:45.873
certain certain planes?

02:28:45.873 --> 02:28:48.847
MATT: It looks like it's sitting in the center of
the Astral Sea, and doesn't have any tethers.

02:28:48.847 --> 02:28:52.357
Everything else seems to be tethered by these
silver cords, almost, that puts in this large

02:28:52.357 --> 02:28:56.695
tapestry. And that is just floating between all
the lines in the middle of the Astral Sea.

02:28:56.695 --> 02:28:59.344
TRAVIS: Confused by its location, I'm gonna
touch it.

02:28:59.344 --> 02:29:00.199
MATT: You touch it?

02:29:00.199 --> 02:29:01.101
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:29:01.101 --> 02:29:02.108
DEBORAH: Yes!

02:29:02.108 --> 02:29:02.892
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:29:02.892 --> 02:29:08.024
MATT: You touch it, and all of you hear this loud,
heavy shattering sound as the window shatters into

02:29:08.024 --> 02:29:13.320
a hundred different pieces, all of them stopping
about three feet from the window and freezing in

02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:20.503
place. Fjord, standing before it in this void gets
sucked into the darkness and the glass window

02:29:20.503 --> 02:29:22.574
closes behind him.

02:29:22.737 --> 02:29:23.611
MARISHA: What?!

02:29:23.611 --> 02:29:25.055
SAM: Ah! What did he touch?!

02:29:25.055 --> 02:29:26.302
MARISHA: Are you serious?!

02:29:26.302 --> 02:29:27.546
DEBORAH: He touched the--

02:29:27.546 --> 02:29:29.456
MATT: No, no one technically was watching.

02:29:29.456 --> 02:29:32.160
LIAM: The red bubble? This is some labyrinth shit,
motherfucker.

02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:34.165
LAURA: What just happened? Where did Fjord just
go?

02:29:34.165 --> 02:29:36.159
SAM: (yelling) Fjord! No!

02:29:36.159 --> 02:29:38.211
MARISHA: Why does this keep happening to you?

02:29:38.211 --> 02:29:40.082
TRAVIS: Because I do stupid shit!

02:29:40.082 --> 02:29:44.497
MATT: So what are you guys doing? We'll get to you
later.

02:29:44.497 --> 02:29:46.866
DEBORAH: We were on the way to the cabinet--

02:29:46.866 --> 02:29:50.992
TRAVIS: Why does he got to describe it and make it
sound so interesting?

02:29:50.992 --> 02:29:53.237
SAM: How can you focus on the cabinet right now?!

02:29:53.237 --> 02:29:55.181
DEBORAH: Because maybe it'll tell us where he
went!

02:29:55.181 --> 02:29:58.260
SAM: Okay, you're right. There might be
information in there. Let's go look at the cabinet.

02:29:58.400 --> 02:29:59.952
DEBORAH: We're going to the cabinet.

02:29:59.952 --> 02:30:03.900
SAM: I will support you and help you and aid you,
but judgmentally.

02:30:05.997 --> 02:30:08.593
LAURA: I'm going to run up where Fjord
disappeared.

02:30:08.593 --> 02:30:11.975
MARISHA: I was actually technically watching from
downstairs.

02:30:11.975 --> 02:30:18.955
MATT: You guys notice him vanish. There's no like,
where did Fjord go? You heard the wall explode and

02:30:18.955 --> 02:30:21.440
him disappear and then it reset itself and
closed.

02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:22.921
SAM: No one else touch it!

02:30:22.921 --> 02:30:25.404
TALIESIN: Okay, let's all just be very careful
before we do anything.

02:30:25.404 --> 02:30:27.202
DEBORAH: I like his style!

02:30:27.202 --> 02:30:30.612
LIAM: I know a lot of people are doing a lot of
things, but eventually get to me, I'm going to

02:30:30.612 --> 02:30:34.015
start ransacking the desk for notes about that.

02:30:34.015 --> 02:30:38.422
MATT: Okay. Caleb's heading over to the desk. As
you're walking by, Caleb, there are books and

02:30:38.422 --> 02:30:46.328
books on these shelves, and you notice that all of
the books have a brass binding around them, like a

02:30:46.328 --> 02:30:51.958
lock. Like a square shaped manacle that is affixed
around it, and it looks like all of them are

02:30:51.958 --> 02:30:58.283
locked in some way. There might be ways to open
it, but it looks like whoever left this alone did

02:30:58.283 --> 02:31:01.240
not intend for anyone to open it but them.

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:03.996
LAURA: That looks like an open book at the end of
the room, Caleb.

02:31:03.996 --> 02:31:05.944
LIAM: I'm looking for a way to help Fjord right
now.

02:31:05.944 --> 02:31:11.235
MATT: You guys are over at the opposite end of
this closed thing. This also has a brass bar that

02:31:11.235 --> 02:31:14.602
is bolted and affixed to the closed cabinet.

02:31:14.602 --> 02:31:16.174
DEBORAH: Want to take it?

02:31:16.174 --> 02:31:17.557
SAM: Unlock it? Yes.

02:31:17.557 --> 02:31:18.674
DEBORAH: You want me to do it?

02:31:18.674 --> 02:31:19.938
SAM: Yes, I will aid you.

02:31:19.938 --> 02:31:21.749
DEBORAH: Okay, so I'm thieves' tooling on it.

02:31:21.749 --> 02:31:23.736
MATT: All right, so make an attempt with
advantage.

02:31:24.487 --> 02:31:25.750
DEBORAH: 27.

02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:33.364
MATT: You manage to find an area underneath the
bar where there's a button press or symbol, and

02:31:33.364 --> 02:31:37.762
you get one of the tools underneath, push it
inside, and turn. As you do, the bar (click).

02:31:37.762 --> 02:31:43.676
DEBORAH: While Twiggy does this, she sticks her
tongue out the side of her mouth and one eye closed.

02:31:44.411 --> 02:31:46.591
MATT: It appears to be unlocked.

02:31:46.933 --> 02:31:48.152
DEBORAH: Okay.

02:31:48.152 --> 02:31:49.980
SAM: Let's open it.

02:31:49.980 --> 02:31:52.536
DEBORAH: We both take each one and open up the
cabinet.

02:31:52.536 --> 02:31:56.982
MATT: Okay, you open the inside of the cabinet,
and it is empty.

02:31:56.982 --> 02:31:59.005
DEBORAH: I don't buy it.

02:31:59.005 --> 02:32:01.186
SAM: Let's feel around, wiggle around.

02:32:01.186 --> 02:32:02.873
DEBORAH: We stick our hands in.

02:32:02.873 --> 02:32:11.215
MATT: Okay! You put your hands inside the empty
cabinet, and it immediately closes on your arms as

02:32:11.215 --> 02:32:14.688
teeth suddenly emerge from the sides of the door.

02:32:14.688 --> 02:32:16.940
(yelling, groaning)

02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:18.210
MARISHA: Shut up!

02:32:18.210 --> 02:32:25.165
MATT: No, actually, this is an attack on each of
you. Oh, that's cocked. Okay, that is 23 against you.

02:32:25.306 --> 02:32:27.020
DEBORAH: Okay.

02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:29.428
MATT: And that is 17 against you.

02:32:29.428 --> 02:32:30.815
SAM: Hits.

02:32:30.815 --> 02:32:40.362
MATT: All right. Each of you suffer 14 points of
piercing damage.

02:32:40.362 --> 02:32:41.575
SAM: Uncanny dodge.

02:32:41.575 --> 02:32:43.058
DEBORAH: Yeah, uncanny dodge.

02:32:43.058 --> 02:32:46.772
MATT: Both of you take seven points of piercing
damage, but you are both currently grappled as it

02:32:46.772 --> 02:32:52.780
is slammed on your arms in a very The Thing kind
of way, like when the guy's chest opens and

02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:57.963
closes. Yeah, it's some John Carpenter. It closes
on you and you see on each of the doors where the

02:32:57.963 --> 02:33:04.735
striations of the wood are, they split and you see
these eyes peek through at you.

02:33:04.735 --> 02:33:08.171
LAURA: I immediately turn around and Invoke
Duplicity down on the ground near them.

02:33:08.171 --> 02:33:11.175
MATT: Okay. All right, that Invoke Duplicity
appears. Where do you want her to be?

02:33:11.175 --> 02:33:13.217
LAURA: Right next to them.

02:33:13.217 --> 02:33:14.926
MATT: Okay, yeah, so you guys are both up here
right now.

02:33:14.926 --> 02:33:16.014
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:33:16.014 --> 02:33:17.825
TALIESIN: For Pete's-- Sacred Flame.

02:33:17.825 --> 02:33:20.338
MATT: All right, I need you guys to roll
initiative.

02:33:20.338 --> 02:33:21.974
SAM: Oh, boy.

02:33:21.974 --> 02:33:23.560
TRAVIS: What about me, Matt?

02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:25.594
MATT: Nope!

02:33:26.073 --> 02:33:28.975
TRAVIS: I'm going to do it! 19.

02:33:29.875 --> 02:33:31.784
MATT: Okay, so, 25 to 20?

02:33:33.926 --> 02:33:34.958
20 to 15?

02:33:34.958 --> 02:33:36.099
DEBORAH: 17.

02:33:36.099 --> 02:33:37.541
SAM: Hey!

02:33:37.541 --> 02:33:39.161
MATT: All righty.

02:33:40.021 --> 02:33:41.907
SAM and MARISHA: Marishative.

02:33:41.907 --> 02:33:44.056
SAM: Roll for Marishative.

02:33:44.128 --> 02:33:46.041
MATT: There you go. 15 to ten?

02:33:46.041 --> 02:33:46.591
MARISHA: 11.

02:33:46.591 --> 02:33:49.417
SAM: 12. Whoa, you guys.

02:33:49.417 --> 02:33:52.058
MATT: Beau is going at the same time as the
cabinet.

02:33:52.058 --> 02:33:55.857
MARISHA: "Beau is going at the same time as the
cabinet."

02:33:55.857 --> 02:34:05.313
MATT: I love saying that. That's an actual phrase
that exists. I'm so happy. Ten to five?

02:34:05.313 --> 02:34:08.674
LAURA: Five, but I rolled a natural one.

02:34:08.674 --> 02:34:09.694
LIAM: Six.

02:34:09.694 --> 02:34:14.516
MATT: Okay, got you. Caduceus?

02:34:14.590 --> 02:34:15.952
TALIESIN: Three.

02:34:15.952 --> 02:34:16.839
MATT: All right.

02:34:16.839 --> 02:34:18.997
TALIESIN: There's a long sigh at the beginning of
the round.

02:34:18.997 --> 02:34:20.762
MATT: Twiggy, you're up first.

02:34:20.762 --> 02:34:26.304
DEBORAH: I'm up first. First, I would like to, if
possible, try to extricate my hands from this. Is

02:34:26.304 --> 02:34:27.294
it possible?

02:34:27.294 --> 02:34:30.423
MATT: It is. You have to use an action to try and
escape with an ability check. You can choose

02:34:30.423 --> 02:34:32.204
either acrobatics or athletics.

02:34:32.204 --> 02:34:37.009
DEBORAH: Acrobatics! That is a 19.

02:34:37.009 --> 02:34:40.393
MATT: 19 is enough! You manage to wedge your
arm--

02:34:40.393 --> 02:34:41.889
DEBORAH: I put my foot up!

02:34:41.889 --> 02:34:44.729
MATT: -- and pull out, and, yeah, you manage to
free yourself from its grasp.

02:34:44.729 --> 02:34:50.580
DEBORAH: Cool. Using my bonus action, I want to
disengage from it and back up a little bit.

02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:54.571
MATT: Okay, easy enough. You manage to back up to
there.

02:34:54.571 --> 02:34:55.513
DEBORAH: Yeah.

02:34:55.513 --> 02:34:57.332
MATT: That finishes your go. Nott, you're up
next.

02:34:57.332 --> 02:34:59.153
SAM: Same exact move.

02:34:59.153 --> 02:35:02.451
MATT: Two peas in a pod over here.

02:35:02.451 --> 02:35:05.890
SAM: Yes, that's a 23.

02:35:05.890 --> 02:35:10.652
MATT: You manage to pull yourself free of it as
well and back up to this side.

02:35:10.652 --> 02:35:13.761
SAM: Bonus action disengage!

02:35:13.761 --> 02:35:15.631
MATT: And pull away, no worries.

02:35:15.631 --> 02:35:17.712
DEBORAH: I put up my arm and I go: Twinsies!

02:35:17.712 --> 02:35:21.521
SAM: Ow! So much blood.

02:35:21.521 --> 02:35:25.265
MATT: That finishes your go. Beau and the cabinet
go at the same time. Your dexterity is higher than

02:35:25.265 --> 02:35:29.255
the cabinet's so you go first. It's a cabinet.

02:35:29.255 --> 02:35:31.208
SAM: Hey, that's great. It's got four legs.

02:35:31.208 --> 02:35:35.209
MARISHA: Man, some days you lose, some days you
beat a cabinet.

02:35:35.209 --> 02:35:38.012
(laughter)

02:35:38.012 --> 02:35:40.951
MATT: (singing) Levitz pained! (spoken) What are
you doing?

02:35:40.951 --> 02:35:47.459
MARISHA: I look over and I go: They're fine, and I
go upstairs with Jester.

02:35:47.459 --> 02:35:51.721
TRAVIS: You're not going to whale on this cabinet,
bro?

02:35:51.721 --> 02:35:54.759
MARISHA: Nope. I don't give a fuck right now about
that cabinet.

02:35:54.759 --> 02:35:57.216
MATT: All right, the cabinet--

02:35:57.216 --> 02:36:01.146
MARISHA: Oh, it moves? Now I care a little.

02:36:01.146 --> 02:36:08.888
MATT: Yeah, this is full on, we're talking dark
side of Beauty and the Beast here. Just making its

02:36:08.888 --> 02:36:16.286
way forward. It does notice it's an illusion. It
just steps through it.

02:36:16.286 --> 02:36:19.636
SAM: That's a perceptive cabinet.

02:36:19.636 --> 02:36:21.185
DEBORAH: It is!

02:36:21.185 --> 02:36:32.130
MATT: It moves through and it's going to attempt
to bite. It can bite whoever is adjacent in front

02:36:32.130 --> 02:36:36.867
of it. As you guys move back, it's going to try
and open and try and swallow you up into it.

02:36:36.867 --> 02:36:37.600
DEBORAH: All right.

02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:44.198
MATT: It's going to attempt to lean forward and
pull you into the cabinet's mouth. Against you,

02:36:44.198 --> 02:36:48.295
Nott, that is-- Ooh, that's a 12. I don't think
that hits.

02:36:48.295 --> 02:36:49.270
SAM: Do I roll against that?

02:36:49.270 --> 02:36:50.272
MATT: No, it's just a hit.

02:36:50.272 --> 02:36:51.640
SAM: Oh, does not hit.

02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:53.762
MATT: Yep. And against you, natural 18.

02:36:53.762 --> 02:36:54.771
DEBORAH: Oh, yeah, you hit.

02:36:54.771 --> 02:36:56.892
MATT: Yeah, all right, so you suffer--

02:36:56.892 --> 02:37:04.387
DEBORAH: Now, did that first uncanny dodge count
as my reaction, or can I use it now?

02:37:04.387 --> 02:37:07.328
MATT: You've had your turn since, so you have your
reaction back.

02:37:07.328 --> 02:37:08.710
DEBORAH: So I can halve it now.

02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:12.141
MATT: Yes, you can. So it would be 16 points of
piercing damage, which is reduced to eight;

02:37:12.141 --> 02:37:14.897
however, you are swallowed.

02:37:14.897 --> 02:37:16.581
LIAM: Oh, she's in it!

02:37:16.581 --> 02:37:23.524
MATT: So you're inside of it now. It scoops you
up. It lowers down and slams the cabinet shut as

02:37:23.604 --> 02:37:30.202
it pulls back. Twiggy's legs are kicking there,
and like Audrey 2, it just sucks her inside of the cabinet.

02:37:30.202 --> 02:37:33.033
DEBORAH: I'll never stop loving you!

02:37:33.033 --> 02:37:35.845
SAM: It's okay, she's lived in a box for like a
week.

02:37:35.845 --> 02:37:38.345
MATT: She's used to this! Caleb, you're up.

02:37:38.345 --> 02:37:45.130
LIAM: I am going to trust my friends to take care
of the monster. I have a feeling about the desk.

02:37:45.130 --> 02:37:50.001
This is what I would do. I would think that there
might be something in this man's desk, so I start

02:37:50.001 --> 02:37:51.532
looking for anything of use.

02:37:51.532 --> 02:37:52.963
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:37:52.963 --> 02:37:54.222
SAM: The desk is a mimic.

02:37:54.222 --> 02:37:55.961
LIAM: It is a 16.

02:37:55.961 --> 02:38:03.950
MATT: Taking a minute to glance through, a couple
of things. One, you pull open one of the drawers.

02:38:03.950 --> 02:38:13.338
You see a glass jar about this big that contains
about a hundred or so of these small glass beads.

02:38:13.338 --> 02:38:20.631
There's that. You go, "Okay, that's that." On the
desk itself, there's a large vial of ink, about

02:38:20.631 --> 02:38:26.455
that big. It's a heavy vial of ink with this big
red quill placed next to it into a little cap.

02:38:26.455 --> 02:38:30.594
TRAVIS: May be Taliesin's.

02:38:30.594 --> 02:38:34.091
TALIESIN: This is a death trap. This is a fucking
death trap.

02:38:34.091 --> 02:38:41.323
MATT: The cork that has been removed from the ink
vial is laid there next to it on the table. You

02:38:41.403 --> 02:38:52.134
see, in another cabinet, a small porcelain doll.
It's made of porcelain and silk. It's crafted to

02:38:52.134 --> 02:38:56.934
look like a young woman in a very fine blue and
black silk dress. The hair is long and silver, and

02:38:56.934 --> 02:39:00.232
the hair in particular is very realistic.

02:39:00.232 --> 02:39:01.933
DEBORAH: Too much detail.

02:39:01.933 --> 02:39:04.070
LAURA: Voodoo doll.

02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:07.029
TRAVIS: I love it when the DM describes something
as too realistic.

02:39:07.029 --> 02:39:08.023
MATT: That's all you find in the desk.

02:39:08.023 --> 02:39:16.259
LIAM: Okay, so then what I do is think: All these
things can kill me. I back away from the desk. I'm

02:39:16.259 --> 02:39:21.573
going to move as far as I can away from the
dresser, along this way.

02:39:21.573 --> 02:39:22.509
MATT: That'll put you there.

02:39:22.509 --> 02:39:23.528
LIAM: No, I'm sorry, I meant--

02:39:23.528 --> 02:39:28.764
MATT: I'm saying you're at the desk to search it.
So that's (counting) 30, which puts you there.

02:39:28.764 --> 02:39:30.198
LIAM: Exactly, so yeah.

02:39:30.198 --> 02:39:31.145
MATT: That finishes your go, Caleb?

02:39:31.145 --> 02:39:31.838
LIAM: That's it.

02:39:31.838 --> 02:39:33.360
MATT: Jester, you're up.

02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:40.215
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to turn around with my
duplicate, and I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds on

02:39:40.215 --> 02:39:41.750
the cabinet.

02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:43.006
MATT: Go for it.

02:39:43.006 --> 02:39:44.270
LAURA: Can you do that?

02:39:44.270 --> 02:39:45.222
MATT: Yeah, you can.

02:39:45.222 --> 02:39:47.825
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to do that at 2nd-level.

02:39:47.825 --> 02:39:50.341
MATT: Second level, so is that 4d10 damage?

02:39:50.341 --> 02:39:52.260
LAURA: Yeah, that's 4d10.

02:39:52.260 --> 02:39:56.833
MATT: Roll to hit first. You have to roll a d20
and then add your spell attack.

02:39:56.833 --> 02:39:58.205
SAM: Side of a barn door, right?

02:39:58.205 --> 02:40:00.461
MATT: Yes, not hard to hit. It's a cabinet.

02:40:00.461 --> 02:40:01.410
LAURA: 17.

02:40:01.410 --> 02:40:09.334
MATT: 17 definitely hits. Roll damage. Since your
illusion is immaterial-- go ahead?

02:40:09.334 --> 02:40:12.699
TRAVIS: Would the cabinet have a French accent
when it talked?

02:40:12.699 --> 02:40:14.019
MATT: You'll find out.

02:40:14.019 --> 02:40:16.009
DEBORAH: Be our guest.

02:40:16.009 --> 02:40:19.271
MATT: Hon hon hon, nom nom nom, I love me some
gnome flesh!

02:40:19.271 --> 02:40:20.547
TRAVIS: I have been here for so long.

02:40:20.547 --> 02:40:21.765
DEBORAH: Nom nom nom.

02:40:21.765 --> 02:40:23.008
LAURA: 20 points.

02:40:23.008 --> 02:40:24.393
MATT: 20 points of damage.

02:40:24.393 --> 02:40:25.447
LAURA: Yes.

02:40:25.447 --> 02:40:28.457
DEBORAH: I have not eaten since the Calamity.

02:40:28.457 --> 02:40:32.020
(laughter)

02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:38.269
MATT: The burst of necrotic energy slams into it,
and the cabinet shakes in place. The eyes roll in

02:40:38.269 --> 02:40:44.020
pain for a second, and they withdraw into the wood
before they pop out once more from the doorways.

02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:52.133
It seems to chew for a second in anger, but it
looks hurt. It's not bloodied, but that was a

02:40:52.133 --> 02:40:54.626
hefty hit. Not bad.

02:40:54.626 --> 02:41:01.452
MARISHA: While she was doing that, I was like: I
feel like I saw him look over here somewhere. So

02:41:01.452 --> 02:41:03.006
over here, yeah.

02:41:03.006 --> 02:41:05.393
LAURA: Yeah, I'm paying attention to her and going
(vague noise).

02:41:05.393 --> 02:41:07.862
MATT: That finishes Jester's go? Caduceus, you're
up.

02:41:07.862 --> 02:41:15.569
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit it with Sacred Flame.

02:41:15.569 --> 02:41:18.509
MATT: I got caught up in it.

02:41:18.509 --> 02:41:20.410
TALIESIN: Going to hit this guy with a Sacred
Flame.

02:41:20.410 --> 02:41:21.916
MATT: Sacred Flame is a dexterity saving throw?

02:41:21.916 --> 02:41:23.567
TALIESIN: Yep, dexterity saving throw.

02:41:23.567 --> 02:41:26.271
MATT: Nope! It's not very fast, this cabinet.

02:41:26.271 --> 02:41:32.642
TALIESIN: Nah, I didn't think it would be. That's
not bad; that's 14 points of damage.

02:41:32.642 --> 02:41:38.262
MATT: 14 points of damage. You watch this burst of
divine energy around it with this faint aqua glow

02:41:38.262 --> 02:41:42.826
to it as it burns around it. The area where it
hits, you see the wood darken and splinter. Its

02:41:42.826 --> 02:41:46.769
boxlike shape is beginning to warp and twist a
little bit as it's starting to give up a little

02:41:46.769 --> 02:41:50.637
bit of its instinctual form. Now it's looking
hurt.

02:41:50.637 --> 02:41:53.820
TALIESIN: Spit it out! Come on!

02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:55.469
MATT: That finishes your go?

02:41:55.469 --> 02:41:56.833
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:41:56.833 --> 02:42:00.203
MATT: Twiggy. Top of your turn. First things
first, it's digesting you.

02:42:00.203 --> 02:42:01.732
DEBORAH: Cool.

02:42:01.732 --> 02:42:09.202
MATT: You take, ooh, that's 15 points of acid
damage. You are inside of it, still.

02:42:09.202 --> 02:42:11.457
DEBORAH: Cool. I'm inside?

02:42:11.457 --> 02:42:14.442
LIAM: Fava beans.

02:42:14.442 --> 02:42:20.344
DEBORAH: Because I have an ally within five feet,
can I attack it from the inside using sneak attack?

02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:27.146
MATT: I'd allow it. There's few places as exposed
and vulnerable as the inside of its mouth!

02:42:27.146 --> 02:42:31.341
DEBORAH: Yeah, I'm going to hang out for a minute
and attack it from the inside.

02:42:31.341 --> 02:42:35.535
MATT: Okay. You are restrained, so it's
disadvantage on the attack, but it is also the

02:42:35.535 --> 02:42:38.244
inside of its mouth, so try it out.

02:42:38.244 --> 02:42:47.084
DEBORAH: Let's do it because it's fun.
Disadvantage is an 18 plus seven, so I think

02:42:47.084 --> 02:42:49.723
that's pretty good.

02:42:49.723 --> 02:42:51.969
LIAM: Deborah, can you be here every week?

02:42:51.969 --> 02:43:01.842
DEBORAH: That's a nine from my initial hit,
piercing. Then with my sneak attack, another four

02:43:01.842 --> 02:43:06.083
and six, so another ten. 19 total.

02:43:06.083 --> 02:43:10.903
MATT: 19 points of damage from the inside as you
jam the dagger up into the top of the cabinet.

02:43:10.903 --> 02:43:16.219
It's a combination of wood striation and weird
liquid muscle that are pushing against you as it's

02:43:16.219 --> 02:43:24.097
digesting you. You jam upward where you imagine
the head might be. As you do, you hear (groaning)

02:43:24.097 --> 02:43:27.356
from the inside. It begins shifting and quaking,
and the muscles are beginning to spasm. It needs

02:43:27.356 --> 02:43:33.215
to make a constitution saving throw, which it
fails and spits you out. You are prone on the

02:43:33.215 --> 02:43:36.090
ground adjacent it. But it does like, (throwing
up).

02:43:36.090 --> 02:43:38.160
DEBORAH: What does the digestive juices look
like?

02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:44.350
MATT: It is a coating of semi-translucent film
with a very faint green texture to it. But it

02:43:44.350 --> 02:43:46.338
mostly looks like spittle, a very thick spittle.

02:43:46.338 --> 02:43:47.154
DEBORAH: And I'm covered in it.

02:43:47.154 --> 02:43:50.023
MATT: You're covered in it. We're talking
Ghostbusters slimer hit covered.

02:43:50.023 --> 02:43:54.468
DEBORAH: As I'm lying on the ground, I wipe it off
the front of my face and throw it on the ground

02:43:54.468 --> 02:43:56.584
and growl at the cabinet.

02:43:56.584 --> 02:43:57.970
MATT: You still have movement.

02:43:57.970 --> 02:44:01.788
DEBORAH: I do have movement. As a bonus action, I
can disengage.

02:44:01.788 --> 02:44:06.659
MATT: You can. Half your movement to get prone, if
you want to, unless you want to crawl.

02:44:06.659 --> 02:44:09.782
DEBORAH: I think I want to crawl. Am I halved if I
crawl?

02:44:09.782 --> 02:44:11.086
MATT: Yeah.

02:44:11.086 --> 02:44:12.842
DEBORAH: But I'm halved if I stand up anyway.

02:44:12.842 --> 02:44:14.406
MATT: Yeah, your call.

02:44:14.406 --> 02:44:20.216
DEBORAH: I'm going to crawl. I'm going to go back
half, so 15 feet.

02:44:20.216 --> 02:44:21.781
MATT: You can get under the table if you want.

02:44:21.781 --> 02:44:24.531
DEBORAH: Yeah, I'm going to go 15 feet back under
the table. I can't hide, but I'm going to get

02:44:24.531 --> 02:44:26.358
under there because it's not that smart.

02:44:26.358 --> 02:44:28.533
MATT: You leave this little trail on the ground as
you get under the table.

02:44:28.533 --> 02:44:30.037
DEBORAH: Yeah, slug slime.

02:44:30.037 --> 02:44:32.158
MATT: You got it. Nott, you're up first.

02:44:32.158 --> 02:44:34.354
SAM: Is Jester's duplicate considered--?

02:44:34.354 --> 02:44:36.176
MATT: It does not count as an ally.

02:44:36.176 --> 02:44:42.981
SAM: Okay. Well then, I will bonus action-- shit.
I won't bonus action. I will move away from it.

02:44:42.981 --> 02:44:47.161
MATT: Okay, you step away. It takes an attack of
opportunity with you. It's going to attempt to

02:44:47.161 --> 02:44:51.498
bite at you and consume you. That is a 15 to hit.
What's your armor class?

02:44:51.498 --> 02:44:52.248
SAM: 16.

02:44:52.248 --> 02:44:57.465
MATT: You just manage to duck out of the way as it
slams shut inches from your body.

02:44:57.465 --> 02:45:01.976
SAM: Okay. I'll skitter behind near that
candelabra and bonus action hide.

02:45:01.976 --> 02:45:05.787
MATT: You are going to attempt to hide over here
or over here?

02:45:05.787 --> 02:45:07.037
SAM: Well, I was going over--

02:45:07.037 --> 02:45:09.472
MATT: Oh, this way. You manage to bonus action
hide. All right, roll a stealth check.

02:45:09.472 --> 02:45:12.901
SAM: Okay. 19 plus a million. So it's a--

02:45:12.901 --> 02:45:14.662
MATT: You feel pretty stealthy.

02:45:14.662 --> 02:45:19.294
SAM: 29, yeah. I think we still have Pass without
Trace. 39.

02:45:19.294 --> 02:45:22.359
MATT: You feel pretty hidden. Just throwing it out
there.

02:45:22.359 --> 02:45:26.154
SAM: Then I will attack from my hidden position.

02:45:26.154 --> 02:45:27.971
MATT: All right, so you move back out.

02:45:27.971 --> 02:45:31.730
LAURA: You actually I don't think have Pass
without Trace because I Invoked Duplicity, but whatever.

02:45:31.810 --> 02:45:33.717
MATT: Oh, that's right, yeah. It's fine; he's
still hidden.

02:45:33.717 --> 02:45:36.347
SAM: Okay, so that is a 24 to hit.

02:45:36.347 --> 02:45:38.170
MATT: You do have advantage on the attack since it
did not see you.

02:45:38.170 --> 02:45:40.179
SAM: Still 24 to hit.

02:45:40.179 --> 02:45:41.559
MATT: Yeah, all right.

02:45:41.559 --> 02:46:00.361
SAM: Let's see here. (counting) That's 21, plus
I'll use Fury of the Small. That's 28. I was going

02:46:00.361 --> 02:46:07.974
to use one of my explosive arrows, but I have
three, and one of them doesn't work. So I don't

02:46:07.974 --> 02:46:09.406
know which one I drew.

02:46:09.406 --> 02:46:13.354
MATT: Roll a d6. On a one or a two, it's the
defunct one.

02:46:13.708 --> 02:46:15.225
SAM: It's a two!

02:46:15.225 --> 02:46:17.546
MATT: Perfect! Well, regardless, how do you want
to do this?

02:46:17.546 --> 02:46:30.309
SAM: Where do I shoot on a cabinet? I'll wait till
the doors are just a little open and try to thread

02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:33.546
the needle and jam it right through its mouth
heart.

02:46:33.546 --> 02:46:40.989
MATT: As it vanishes into its mouth heart, the
cabinet closes shut. The eyes go wide for a

02:46:40.989 --> 02:46:45.487
second, and you are waiting for the explosion
like, (straining).

02:46:45.487 --> 02:46:47.070
SAM: It's filled with pepper.

02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:55.175
MATT: Yeah. It goes (sneezing) and starts sneezing
heavily. As it's sneezing, the wounds that it's

02:46:55.175 --> 02:47:01.235
taken are causing it to sneeze up its blood. It is
leaving puddles on the ground, until eventually

02:47:01.235 --> 02:47:05.363
the eyes roll back and it falls on the ground.

02:47:05.363 --> 02:47:07.630
LIAM: That cabinet had a mother!

02:47:07.630 --> 02:47:11.096
LAURA: That was pretty gross, straight through.

02:47:11.096 --> 02:47:16.986
TALIESIN: Let's all maybe be a little more careful
about the--

02:47:16.986 --> 02:47:18.418
LIAM: Fjord, Fjord.

02:47:18.418 --> 02:47:19.366
MARISHA: He's gone.

02:47:19.366 --> 02:47:22.290
LIAM: Yeah, what are we going to do about it,
Nott?

02:47:22.290 --> 02:47:23.786
SAM: Are you okay?

02:47:23.786 --> 02:47:25.409
DEBORAH: I'm okay. Gnome power of two!

02:47:25.409 --> 02:47:26.855
MATT: It's a room filled with books, Caleb.

02:47:26.855 --> 02:47:27.927
SAM: I'm not. I'm a goblin.

02:47:27.927 --> 02:47:30.541
MATT: Make a choice.

02:47:30.541 --> 02:47:32.736
LIAM: I'm going to join the women up top.

02:47:32.736 --> 02:47:38.731
TALIESIN: Is there anything I see on the top of
these cabinets? There's all this space above, and

02:47:38.731 --> 02:47:39.925
I want to see if there's anything--

02:47:39.925 --> 02:47:41.047
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:47:41.047 --> 02:47:48.481
TALIESIN: All right. Come on. I'll take that.
That's a 17.

02:47:48.481 --> 02:47:55.052
MATT: Looking up there, behind one of the
cabinets, you see a small stack of books that

02:47:55.052 --> 02:48:00.055
haven't been categorized yet. They're still locked
with the same bronze binder, but it looks like

02:48:00.055 --> 02:48:03.251
they were set aside, like somebody threw them up
there to get to later.

02:48:03.251 --> 02:48:13.109
TALIESIN: Hey-- oh god, everybody's-- Twiggy, can
you grab that stack of books over there and throw

02:48:13.109 --> 02:48:16.111
them at Caleb? Or take a look at that.

02:48:16.111 --> 02:48:23.296
DEBORAH: You got it, friend! I run. I'm still
covered in disgustingness, so I start wiping it

02:48:23.296 --> 02:48:25.801
off and shaking like a dog. It flies everywhere.

02:48:25.801 --> 02:48:27.116
MATT: All over the place.

02:48:27.116 --> 02:48:28.354
DEBORAH: Where is it?

02:48:28.354 --> 02:48:30.549
MATT: Up here is where Caduceus is.

02:48:30.549 --> 02:48:34.920
DEBORAH: Up there, yeah. I'll scamper up next to
him.

02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:36.107
TALIESIN: Let's take a look at these.

02:48:36.107 --> 02:48:36.871
DEBORAH: Do you want me to take a look at it?

02:48:36.871 --> 02:48:40.305
TALIESIN: Let's look at this lock, see if it seems
trapped or something, or I don't know.

02:48:40.305 --> 02:48:42.178
DEBORAH: Yeah, I'll check it for a trap.

02:48:42.178 --> 02:48:44.862
MATT: Yeah, go for it. Make an investigation
check.

02:48:44.862 --> 02:48:46.364
DEBORAH: 25.

02:48:46.364 --> 02:48:49.808
MATT: They do not appear to be trapped, but they
are definitely locked.

02:48:49.808 --> 02:48:51.107
DEBORAH: Okay. Thieves' tools?

02:48:51.107 --> 02:48:54.302
MATT: These bronze clasps around their form. Is
that for one book?

02:48:54.302 --> 02:48:55.714
DEBORAH: No, 13.

02:48:55.714 --> 02:49:01.618
MATT: One book. You try and get there, and the
lock breaks. One of your tools snaps inside.

02:49:01.618 --> 02:49:04.543
TALIESIN: Here, wipe it on this. That's okay.

02:49:04.543 --> 02:49:06.245
DEBORAH: I tried.

02:49:06.245 --> 02:49:08.109
MATT: There's the second book and the third book.

02:49:08.109 --> 02:49:11.795
DEBORAH: Okay, second book? 21.

02:49:11.795 --> 02:49:16.990
MATT: That book, the metal brace opens up, and the
book is available to you.

02:49:16.990 --> 02:49:18.303
TALIESIN: Hey, Caleb!

02:49:18.303 --> 02:49:19.865
DEBORAH: Caleb, we got books!

02:49:19.865 --> 02:49:23.324
LIAM: Are there any sigils or writing anywhere on
the frame of the window or in the window?

02:49:23.324 --> 02:49:25.586
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:49:25.586 --> 02:49:28.928
LIAM: Balls. Five.

02:49:28.928 --> 02:49:33.669
MATT: Looking around, no. You see the smooth glass
of different colors, and you see the seams that

02:49:33.669 --> 02:49:40.188
hold them together where it's been sealed. You can
see the various colors and shapes around it. Nah.

02:49:40.188 --> 02:49:41.338
You're panicking a bit.

02:49:41.338 --> 02:49:45.120
LIAM: I want to climb down the ladder and look for
anything, not books right now, but are there any

02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:49.311
buttons or switches or anything out of place,
anything besides decor and a library?

02:49:49.311 --> 02:49:52.811
LAURA: Did anybody see what he was doing when he
disappeared?

02:49:52.811 --> 02:49:59.677
MARISHA: Yeah, he was looking in this area. He was
like, "Ah", and then I feel like I saw his head go

02:49:59.677 --> 02:50:04.930
over here. But then the bookshelf was in the way,
so I couldn't see what he was reaching for.

02:50:04.930 --> 02:50:07.865
SAM: Did anyone check this desk over here, next to
the portrait?

02:50:07.865 --> 02:50:09.795
MATT: That's what Caleb checked earlier.

02:50:09.795 --> 02:50:13.735
SAM: What about the far desk, behind the mimic?

02:50:13.735 --> 02:50:15.983
MATT: No one's looked at that, necessarily.

02:50:15.983 --> 02:50:17.357
SAM: I'll go snoop around there.

02:50:17.357 --> 02:50:23.565
MATT: Okay. You are going to head to that desk
there. Okay, make an investigation check, and

02:50:23.565 --> 02:50:25.372
perception check for you.

02:50:25.372 --> 02:50:28.041
LIAM: Perception or investigation? I'm looking for
hidden switches, or--

02:50:28.041 --> 02:50:30.375
MATT: Oh, I see. Then make an investigation
check.

02:50:30.375 --> 02:50:33.379
SAM: 18 for me.

02:50:33.379 --> 02:50:35.056
LIAM: 23.

02:50:35.056 --> 02:50:46.047
MATT: Looking around, you see, amongst all the
books that are latched in, there's one big,

02:50:46.047 --> 02:50:53.549
beautiful, red leather book with sapphires
embedded in it along the base. It's locked in, and

02:50:53.549 --> 02:51:03.122
it's placed ostentatiously in the center of the
center bookcase right there. You don't catch any

02:51:03.122 --> 02:51:06.243
other hidden chambers, but that stands out.

02:51:06.243 --> 02:51:08.253
TRAVIS: (whispering) Probably not important.

02:51:08.253 --> 02:51:15.637
MATT: You, checking the desk, it is locked. It is
arcane locked.

02:51:15.637 --> 02:51:16.979
SAM: So I can't pick it?

02:51:16.979 --> 02:51:20.485
MATT: You look it. You're like, "This is not
moving." You're not sure if it's trapped,

02:51:20.485 --> 02:51:23.668
necessarily. But glancing at it, you're like,
"This is locked," and it's locked in a way where

02:51:23.668 --> 02:51:26.353
you're not entirely certain. You could try, but
it's going to be a very hard lock.

02:51:26.353 --> 02:51:27.033
SAM: I'll try.

02:51:27.033 --> 02:51:27.774
MATT: Go for it.

02:51:27.774 --> 02:51:30.603
SAM: Natural ten.

02:51:30.603 --> 02:51:33.110
MATT: (laughs) Total of?

02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:34.189
SAM: 20.

02:51:34.189 --> 02:51:35.681
MATT: 20? It's not budging.

02:51:35.681 --> 02:51:36.860
SAM: Okay.

02:51:36.860 --> 02:51:41.110
DEBORAH: Should we open the last book?

02:51:41.110 --> 02:51:42.616
SAM: Do you have Knock or something?

02:51:42.616 --> 02:51:44.302
TALIESIN: What's the title of the first book that
we opened, by the way?

02:51:44.302 --> 02:51:46.728
DEBORAH: Yeah, is there any markings on the one
that we opened?

02:51:46.728 --> 02:51:48.180
TALIESIN: Not opening it, just looking at the--

02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:53.553
MATT: Interestingly enough, the books' titles are
not visible. They are blank, and then once the

02:51:53.553 --> 02:52:01.226
binding comes off, the title appears on the front.
The title of this says Public Debate Records:

02:52:01.226 --> 02:52:03.610
Forum of Zeidel.

02:52:03.610 --> 02:52:04.738
SAM: Yawn.

02:52:04.738 --> 02:52:08.806
DEBORAH: Third one? 20.

02:52:08.806 --> 02:52:17.171
MATT: That one comes off. This one, no title
appears. You see instead a burn mark appear on the

02:52:17.171 --> 02:52:18.799
front, like it's singed.

02:52:18.799 --> 02:52:20.624
DEBORAH: Hmm.

02:52:20.624 --> 02:52:25.317
TALIESIN: That's very interesting. Maybe, here,
let's bring it down to the table, and we'll open

02:52:25.317 --> 02:52:26.783
it from a distance.

02:52:26.783 --> 02:52:32.179
DEBORAH: Yes. We'll bring it down and put it on
the table. Shall my magic hand do it?

02:52:32.179 --> 02:52:35.045
MATT: Okay, you're watching them come over with
these two books, and they put them on the table in

02:52:35.045 --> 02:52:36.312
the center.

02:52:36.312 --> 02:52:38.734
LIAM: So burned book and--

02:52:38.734 --> 02:52:44.293
DEBORAH: It has a burned slash on it. Should I
open it with my magic hand? Everybody stand back?

02:52:44.293 --> 02:52:46.795
SAM: Yes, of course! We've got to find out what's
going on.

02:52:46.795 --> 02:52:49.674
LAURA: I turn around and watch it happen.

02:52:49.674 --> 02:52:51.733
DEBORAH: It goes forward. We're all standing
back.

02:52:51.733 --> 02:52:52.924
MATT: Which book do you open?

02:52:52.924 --> 02:52:54.544
DEBORAH: The one with the burned slash on it.

02:52:54.544 --> 02:53:01.856
MATT: Okay. As it opens up, the pages pull open
and come to rest. Nothing happens.

02:53:01.856 --> 02:53:03.483
LAURA: It's just a book?

02:53:03.483 --> 02:53:07.491
MATT: It's a book. You can see there is a place on
the inside where a name might have been placed,

02:53:07.491 --> 02:53:11.860
but that also has been burned off. You can see
from the way it opened up there are a few pages

02:53:11.860 --> 02:53:14.799
torn out. It looks to be maybe a hundred or so
pages.

02:53:14.799 --> 02:53:17.672
LIAM: Nott, Twiggy, would you both come here,
please?

02:53:17.672 --> 02:53:18.923
SAM: Yes, of course.

02:53:18.923 --> 02:53:19.979
LIAM: This book--

02:53:19.979 --> 02:53:21.242
SAM: The ruby one?

02:53:21.242 --> 02:53:27.548
LIAM: Ja. Do you see anything that could hurt us
by touching this? Do you make anything of this?

02:53:27.548 --> 02:53:29.870
SAM: I will search for traps.

02:53:29.870 --> 02:53:31.297
DEBORAH: I'm going to help you.

02:53:31.297 --> 02:53:32.802
MATT: It's investigation.

02:53:32.802 --> 02:53:33.860
SAM: 11.

02:53:33.860 --> 02:53:36.299
DEBORAH: If I help him, can he have advantage?

02:53:36.299 --> 02:53:38.235
MATT: Sure. If you're helping him out, yeah. Roll
again.

02:53:38.235 --> 02:53:40.928
SAM: 13.

02:53:40.928 --> 02:53:53.607
MATT: It's hard to say. It's definitely a very
pretty book. It's trying to get your attention by

02:53:53.607 --> 02:53:56.245
the way it's designed and placed.

02:53:56.245 --> 02:53:59.606
SAM: Doesn't look like it's dangerous. Looks
safe.

02:53:59.606 --> 02:54:05.611
MATT: Make a perception check, Caleb.

02:54:05.611 --> 02:54:09.800
LIAM: Ja. 22.

02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:14.859
MATT: You're paying attention to this layout. They
open up this book on the table, and you glance

02:54:14.859 --> 02:54:22.541
over at it. You look back, and you look back at
the book. Those are spell equations.

02:54:22.541 --> 02:54:24.669
LAURA: On the one on the table?

02:54:24.669 --> 02:54:25.345
MATT: The one that they just opened on the table.

02:54:25.345 --> 02:54:27.307
SAM: The burned one?

02:54:27.307 --> 02:54:28.480
MATT: The burned one.

02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:30.356
DEBORAH: Has spell equations in it? Okay.

02:54:36.218 --> 02:54:38.716
LIAM: We have to get Fjord out of that window
somehow.

02:54:38.791 --> 02:54:43.970
SAM: Take the book! At least take the book! Hey,
I've got an idea. I don't know how much time we

02:54:43.970 --> 02:54:46.467
have, and yes, we've got to find Fjord--

02:54:46.467 --> 02:54:47.491
LIAM: I'll touch that book.

02:54:47.491 --> 02:54:54.088
MATT: Touch the one that's open? Okay. You touch
it. It's a regular book.

02:54:54.088 --> 02:54:59.476
SAM: Caleb, do we have her Happy Fun Ball?

02:54:59.476 --> 02:55:00.299
LIAM: No.

02:55:00.299 --> 02:55:01.638
SAM: It's gone?

02:55:01.638 --> 02:55:03.169
LAURA: It didn't come with us.

02:55:03.169 --> 02:55:04.745
SAM: Do you have your haversack?

02:55:04.745 --> 02:55:09.042
MATT: Make an investigation check, Beau. Since
Jester's helping you at this point, you can do it

02:55:09.042 --> 02:55:11.932
with advantage because you guys are both glancing
at what to do.

02:55:11.932 --> 02:55:14.670
TALIESIN: I'm taking a look at that other book
really quickly as well.

02:55:14.670 --> 02:55:18.964
MARISHA: Natural 19. Thank you, Gil. 24.

02:55:18.964 --> 02:55:26.969
MATT: Skimming over it, you actually wait for a
moment where Caduceus is walking and the light

02:55:26.969 --> 02:55:33.535
hits it. You can see a point on the glass where
you can just make out the faint dimming of the

02:55:33.535 --> 02:55:40.337
reflection across the smooth surface: the
fingerprint left by Fjord. In a very Sherlock

02:55:40.337 --> 02:55:44.656
Holmes moment, you see the one moment across the
glass where it's not quite as shiny, and it's that

02:55:44.656 --> 02:55:47.306
single bit of red that's imbedded in the glass.

02:55:47.306 --> 02:55:48.749
LAURA: What do you see, Beau?

02:55:48.749 --> 02:55:51.596
MARISHA: Feels like something recent.

02:55:51.596 --> 02:55:53.209
LAURA: Okay.

02:55:53.209 --> 02:55:58.892
MARISHA: I think I know what Fjord did. Hey,
Caduceus.

02:55:58.892 --> 02:56:00.192
TALIESIN: Yeah?

02:56:00.192 --> 02:56:01.290
MARISHA: Or Caleb.

02:56:01.290 --> 02:56:02.042
LIAM: Yeah?

02:56:02.042 --> 02:56:06.339
MARISHA: Can either one of you put light behind
this stained glass?

02:56:06.339 --> 02:56:08.870
TALIESIN: I can try. I'm going to try.

02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:10.584
MARISHA: Backlight it?

02:56:10.584 --> 02:56:15.467
TALIESIN: I'm trying to cast Light on the other
side of the glass. On the glass, on the other side

02:56:15.467 --> 02:56:17.471
of the glass.

02:56:17.471 --> 02:56:21.970
MATT: Technically, it has to be something you
touch. So you can put it on the glass--

02:56:21.970 --> 02:56:23.669
TALIESIN: No, I can throw it.

02:56:23.669 --> 02:56:26.265
MATT: Light as a cantrip is a touch spell.

02:56:26.265 --> 02:56:29.965
TALIESIN: Is it a touch spell? Yeah, you are not
wrong!

02:56:29.965 --> 02:56:37.902
LAURA: I'll get down so that you can get up and
cast it.

02:56:37.902 --> 02:56:42.155
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can't put it on the other side
of the glass because I can't touch the other side

02:56:42.155 --> 02:56:43.656
of the glass.

02:56:43.656 --> 02:56:44.573
MARISHA: Caleb?

02:56:44.573 --> 02:56:51.533
LIAM: I will make four globules of light, and I
will try to put two of them on our side and two on

02:56:51.533 --> 02:56:52.850
the other side.

02:56:52.850 --> 02:56:56.743
MATT: Okay. As the globs appear on the opposite
end, they're snuffed out.

02:56:56.743 --> 02:56:59.720
DEBORAH: I think we should touch it, you guys.

02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:01.157
LIAM and SAM: No!

02:57:01.157 --> 02:57:05.464
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say. I have a
feeling that's where Fjord is. I think he touched

02:57:05.464 --> 02:57:09.907
this thing, which... yeah.

02:57:09.907 --> 02:57:14.723
MATT: Make an intelligence check, Caleb.

02:57:14.723 --> 02:57:22.462
LIAM: I don't know if breaking it is-- 12 plus
straight add the intelligence? 17.

02:57:22.462 --> 02:57:29.404
MATT: The void, the vacuous darkness behind this,
reminds you very closely to the hallway that you

02:57:29.404 --> 02:57:31.597
traveled in here on.

02:57:31.597 --> 02:57:32.964
MARISHA: I mean--

02:57:32.964 --> 02:57:34.067
LIAM: It's not here.

02:57:34.067 --> 02:57:35.843
MARISHA: It's maybe the way out.

02:57:35.843 --> 02:57:37.039
TALIESIN: Probably.

02:57:37.039 --> 02:57:38.494
MARISHA: Or somewhere else.

02:57:38.494 --> 02:57:45.339
SAM: Our options right now are to pull the
mysterious ruby book, to touch the glass, or to

02:57:45.339 --> 02:57:46.857
keep searching.

02:57:46.857 --> 02:57:51.599
LIAM: One of you little ones, please, would you
use your magical hand to touch-- there's a jar in

02:57:51.599 --> 02:57:56.587
that drawer and there is a bottle of ink.

02:57:56.587 --> 02:57:58.535
SAM: You want them both?

02:57:58.535 --> 02:58:01.474
LIAM: If they are safe to touch, but don't use
your fingers.

02:58:01.474 --> 02:58:03.546
DEBORAH: I'll send my hand for the jar.

02:58:03.546 --> 02:58:05.055
SAM: I'll get the ink.

02:58:05.055 --> 02:58:09.025
TALIESIN: I'm going to head over towards that
other ladder really quickly.

02:58:09.025 --> 02:58:12.341
MATT: Okay. You can go ahead and cork the ink and
take it with you.

02:58:12.341 --> 02:58:15.391
LAURA: To come up on the level where Beau is?

02:58:15.471 --> 02:58:20.121
TALIESIN: Well, there's that weird desk behind
there. Have we looked in that desk that's behind the--?

02:58:20.121 --> 02:58:22.419
DEBORAH: Yes, I did. Nott went to look, right?

02:58:22.419 --> 02:58:24.095
LIAM: That smaller desk?

02:58:24.095 --> 02:58:24.857
TALIESIN: Yeah, what was in there?

02:58:24.857 --> 02:58:28.984
SAM: Oh, it's got an arcane lock. Can you undo an
arcane lock?

02:58:28.984 --> 02:58:30.545
TALIESIN: Maybe.

02:58:30.545 --> 02:58:33.783
SAM: Can you dispel it or something?

02:58:33.783 --> 02:58:35.784
TALIESIN: I'll try Dispel Magic. Why the fuck
not?

02:58:35.784 --> 02:58:37.031
MATT: Okay.

02:58:37.031 --> 02:58:42.167
TALIESIN: I cast Dispel Magic on the desk.

02:58:42.167 --> 02:58:49.098
MATT: All righty. Double checking here.

02:58:49.098 --> 02:58:54.306
SAM: A conundrum. Right now Fjord's having coffee
with Grog.

02:58:54.306 --> 02:58:57.609
TRAVIS: (as Fjord) What's your name? (as Grog)
What's your name?!

02:58:57.609 --> 02:59:02.415
MATT: You cast Dispel Magic. There's a release of
arcane energy across it-- sorry, the divine

02:59:02.415 --> 02:59:06.109
energy. You see the sparkles slowly fade as your
concentration ends.

02:59:06.109 --> 02:59:09.040
TALIESIN: Give it a go.

02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:11.847
SAM: Okay. I'll try to pick it again, I guess.

02:59:11.847 --> 02:59:12.917
DEBORAH: I'll help you.

02:59:12.917 --> 02:59:14.432
TALIESIN: I'll head up to the stained glass.

02:59:14.432 --> 02:59:15.667
MATT: Okay. It's not locked anymore.

02:59:15.667 --> 02:59:17.227
SAM: Oh, it's not locked! Oh. We open it!

02:59:17.227 --> 02:59:21.372
MATT: It's a (rumbling). It's one of those roll
tops that slides up.

02:59:21.372 --> 02:59:22.660
MARISHA: I want one of those.

02:59:22.660 --> 02:59:24.286
LIAM: Thousand-year-old roll top.

02:59:24.866 --> 02:59:31.100
MARISHA: While they all do that, I go: I'm going
to see how Fjord's doing-- (thud)-- and hit the ruby.

02:59:31.100 --> 02:59:36.849
MATT: Okay. As this is happening, the glass
shatters. You watch as both Beau and Jester get

02:59:36.849 --> 02:59:38.294
pulled in.

02:59:38.294 --> 02:59:42.657
MARISHA: Oh. Sorry. Oh shit!

02:59:42.657 --> 02:59:44.726
MATT: It closes back behind them.

02:59:44.726 --> 02:59:48.145
MARISHA: My actions affect other people. Fuck.

02:59:48.145 --> 02:59:52.712
DEBORAH: Twiggy says: The time to be bold is now!
I'll run up and touch the same spot she did.

02:59:52.712 --> 02:59:54.210
SAM: No! Twiggy! Don't!

02:59:54.210 --> 02:59:56.025
MATT: (glass shattering) Twiggy's gone.

02:59:56.025 --> 02:59:59.524
TRAVIS: What a fucking bunch of idiots we are!
It's so good.

02:59:59.524 --> 03:00:01.161
TALIESIN: Let's take a look to see if there's
anything in that desk.

03:00:01.161 --> 03:00:02.150
TRAVIS: And then there were three.

03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:06.218
MATT: Half your party is now gone. Who knows
where. What are you doing?

03:00:06.218 --> 03:00:09.538
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing the debate book and we're
looking at that desk and then we're taking off.

03:00:09.538 --> 03:00:10.790
SAM: Yeah, we're looking in the desk.

03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:12.279
MATT: Okay. It's empty.

03:00:12.279 --> 03:00:14.773
TALIESIN: Completely?

03:00:14.773 --> 03:00:16.024
LAURA: Oh no.

03:00:16.024 --> 03:00:19.145
SAM: Don't do this! I made this mistake before. It
could be alive.

03:00:19.145 --> 03:00:22.218
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I give up. Let's go find
everybody.

03:00:22.218 --> 03:00:25.900
MATT: All right. You guys go back up?

03:00:25.900 --> 03:00:29.523
TALIESIN: Yep. This place is weird. I did grab the
debate book.

03:00:29.523 --> 03:00:32.467
SAM: Not me. I'm staying with Caleb until the
bitter end.

03:00:32.467 --> 03:00:37.039
MATT: Okay. You stay behind. Caduceus, same thing:
shatters, pulls him in, and then closes and

03:00:37.039 --> 03:00:38.402
reforms itself.

03:00:38.402 --> 03:00:43.586
SAM: This is everything we ever wanted: a room
full of books and it's just us. Should we just

03:00:43.586 --> 03:00:45.342
stay here for a while?

03:00:45.342 --> 03:00:47.277
LIAM: They're all locked. All these books are
locked.

03:00:47.277 --> 03:00:49.224
SAM: I could pick them all. I just need time.

03:00:49.224 --> 03:00:51.270
DEBORAH: (laughing) Take 20.

03:00:51.270 --> 03:01:02.162
LIAM: (stuttering) I walk to that shelf over there
and are they free? Do the books come off the shelf

03:01:02.162 --> 03:01:05.034
even though they're locked?

03:01:05.034 --> 03:01:09.274
MATT: These books, as you pull, they're stuck in
the shelf. It seems like the mechanism has locked

03:01:09.274 --> 03:01:10.430
them into place.

03:01:10.430 --> 03:01:14.140
SAM: A mechanism! I can try. I'll try to unlock
the mechanism.

03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:16.201
LIAM: Try a single time.

03:01:16.201 --> 03:01:18.592
SAM: What am I rolling?

03:01:18.592 --> 03:01:21.706
MATT: This is to unlock. This is your thieves'
tools.

03:01:21.706 --> 03:01:23.023
SAM: 23.

03:01:23.023 --> 03:01:25.158
MATT: The book comes free.

03:01:25.158 --> 03:01:28.529
LIAM: Okay. I put it in my bag.

03:01:28.529 --> 03:01:35.278
TALIESIN: I like that you never check for traps.
It really adds to the unknown.

03:01:35.278 --> 03:01:41.406
LIAM: Just do the two next to that one and then
we'll go.

03:01:41.406 --> 03:01:42.394
SAM: Do they look good?

03:01:42.394 --> 03:01:43.398
LIAM: Yeah, they're very good.

03:01:43.398 --> 03:01:44.895
TRAVIS: Just the two next to that one.

03:01:44.895 --> 03:01:47.034
LIAM: Just do one more.

03:01:47.034 --> 03:01:51.783
SAM: All right. I'll try to unlock the next one.
That's not as good. 12.

03:01:51.783 --> 03:01:55.275
MATT: (strained) It's not moving. It's not
budging.

03:01:55.275 --> 03:01:58.706
SAM: I'll go to the third one. Ooh, that's better!
28.

03:01:58.706 --> 03:02:00.641
MATT: The second one comes free.

03:02:00.641 --> 03:02:06.026
LIAM: Okay. We're going to go follow them and
we're either going to die or get out of here. I

03:02:06.026 --> 03:02:08.098
hope we get out of here.

03:02:08.098 --> 03:02:12.155
SAM: But all these books-- you're sure you got all
the spell books? We need the spell books.

03:02:12.155 --> 03:02:14.609
LIAM: I need them. Let's go.

03:02:14.609 --> 03:02:17.978
SAM: I'm going to just see if there's any loose
books on lower shelves that I can grab on my way out.

03:02:18.006 --> 03:02:20.097
LIAM: I climb up and I'm screaming at Nott: Let's
go!

03:02:20.097 --> 03:02:21.036
SAM: Any other books?

03:02:21.036 --> 03:02:26.907
MATT: As he's moving up there? There's a bunch of
shelves: books on the bottom row, there's the

03:02:26.907 --> 03:02:29.408
center row with the big shiny book, there's the
top row with the other books--

03:02:29.408 --> 03:02:31.277
LIAM: Nott, this is torture to me! Let's go.

03:02:31.277 --> 03:02:33.276
SAM: I take two on the other shelf and let's go.

03:02:33.276 --> 03:02:35.593
MATT: You go and pull? They're in place. They're
not loose.

03:02:35.593 --> 03:02:38.929
SAM: Damn it! I'll try one. Nope. Didn't work.
15.

03:02:38.929 --> 03:02:40.661
MATT: Okay. Doesn't work. Doesn't come free.

03:02:40.661 --> 03:02:42.594
SAM: All right, I'm going.

03:02:42.594 --> 03:02:45.477
MATT: All right. You press the button?

03:02:45.477 --> 03:02:47.082
LIAM: After you.

03:02:47.082 --> 03:02:50.284
SAM: I can't reach.

03:02:50.284 --> 03:02:55.159
LIAM: I take her finger and I push our fingers
together on it.

03:02:55.159 --> 03:02:58.918
MATT: (glass shattering) Closes behind.

03:02:58.918 --> 03:03:00.782
LIAM: New campaign.

03:03:00.782 --> 03:03:02.531
TALIESIN: Been fun, kids.

03:03:02.531 --> 03:03:05.027
MATT: I'll move this out of the way.

03:03:05.027 --> 03:03:07.789
SAM: We could have done the ruby book!

03:03:07.789 --> 03:03:09.907
DEBORAH: I came to destroy your party.

03:03:09.907 --> 03:03:12.160
LIAM: It was a red herring. That was a trap.

03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:15.222
SAM: Or it could've been the spell book that
answered all your problems.

03:03:15.222 --> 03:03:23.088
MATT: So Fjord. The sensation of being rapidly
thrust through darkness at a breakneck speed is

03:03:23.088 --> 03:03:32.367
tough on you for the moment that it's there. Your
sense of physicality is stretched for just an

03:03:32.367 --> 03:03:40.596
instant, infinitely. A point of light rapidly
growing towards you until you're pushed through a

03:03:40.596 --> 03:03:47.530
circular portal of some kind. You're falling.
You're falling forward. Gravity is pulling you

03:03:47.530 --> 03:03:51.409
this direction. Make an acrobatics check for me.

03:03:53.218 --> 03:03:56.157
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Natural one.

03:03:57.217 --> 03:04:01.791
MATT: You fall 20 feet. Oh, not too bad. You
suffer four points of bludgeoning damage as you

03:04:01.791 --> 03:04:10.904
slam down onto a circular stone dais. It's rising
out of the middle of this chamber about two feet

03:04:10.904 --> 03:04:22.407
up. You slam into it, get up. There's a smattering
of bone fragments across this platform and the

03:04:22.407 --> 03:04:31.156
floor around it. Bone fragments, bones. You look
around you and you're standing in the center of an

03:04:31.156 --> 03:04:38.411
arrow-shaped chamber. It pulls back a little bit
behind you, but to the back-right of you, there is

03:04:38.411 --> 03:04:43.915
a long hallway that goes into darkness that way.
To the back-left of you, there's another hallway

03:04:43.915 --> 03:04:51.472
that goes into darkness behind you. In front of
you, the chamber continues on for about another 40

03:04:51.472 --> 03:04:59.967
or so feet. There's a dead end. It curves to a
dead end and there is a pedestal in shadow with an

03:04:59.967 --> 03:05:15.841
orb there set onto this pedestal. Before it sits
more corpse fragments surrounding glittering coins

03:05:15.841 --> 03:05:23.976
and jewels-- lots of jewels and gems-- what little
bit of low light in here is catching them. What

03:05:23.976 --> 03:05:27.898
little bit of light there is, it's just the dull
blue light. You can look up and the portal that

03:05:27.898 --> 03:05:34.588
you fell through is this faint blue sparkling loop
that is the only light source in here. The rest of

03:05:34.588 --> 03:05:39.905
it's through your darkvision. You can just see the
faint flicker of it reflect and refract through

03:05:39.905 --> 03:05:49.712
these scattered gemstones amongst this pile and a
curled mass of deep cerulean blue scales. You hear

03:05:49.712 --> 03:06:03.838
a heavy snort from under a large, rigid horn as a
pair of pale blue eyes open and focus onto you,

03:06:03.838 --> 03:06:12.108
the body of the large creature remaining at rest
while its folded wings twitch. Powerful, but

03:06:12.108 --> 03:06:17.833
surprisingly slender, this young blue dragon lifts
its head to address you.

03:06:17.833 --> 03:06:22.405
SAM: Don't worry. You got backup in about five
minutes.

03:06:22.405 --> 03:06:27.435
(laughter)

03:06:27.435 --> 03:06:29.456
SAM: We just took a short rest.

03:06:29.456 --> 03:06:39.654
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) I'm okay. I'm a fucking
sailor; I'm okay. I miss Grog!

03:06:39.654 --> 03:06:42.406
SAM: He's going to talk to you.

03:06:47.736 --> 03:07:00.348
MATT: (snarling) "The smell of unfamiliar sneak
thieves finds us. The way is shut to you."

03:07:08.771 --> 03:07:11.745
TRAVIS: I apologize.

03:07:12.176 --> 03:07:18.445
(laughter)

03:07:18.777 --> 03:07:27.262
TRAVIS: I seem to have stumbled somewhere where I
am not welcome.

03:07:28.507 --> 03:07:31.335
MATT: "That, you have."

03:07:34.128 --> 03:07:45.353
TRAVIS: If you would simply point towards the
exit, I would be most obliged.

03:07:47.557 --> 03:07:53.705
MATT: You're not entirely certain where the pile
of loot and the creature's body really begins.

03:07:53.705 --> 03:07:58.941
It's partially submerged into this nest that it's
burrowed itself into. Besides from its neck that

03:07:58.941 --> 03:08:06.227
slowly begins to extend as its head lifts to meet
your height, you can't really see the rest of it.

03:08:06.227 --> 03:08:24.141
It looks you over, its eyes taking in your shape.
"Where's the fun in that? Why are you here, little morsel?"

03:08:27.204 --> 03:08:30.207
TRAVIS: Can I be entirely honest with you?

03:08:31.186 --> 03:08:32.831
MATT: "Oh, please."

03:08:33.966 --> 03:08:47.327
TRAVIS: I have recently been putting my hands
where they don't belong. This time it sent me to you.

03:08:48.794 --> 03:08:51.390
MATT: "And what have we learned?"

03:08:53.074 --> 03:08:57.071
TRAVIS: Probably to look and not touch.

03:08:59.074 --> 03:09:11.566
MATT: "Good. Tell me, what else have those grubby
hands touched? I like to know the flavors to expect."

03:09:13.774 --> 03:09:22.300
TRAVIS: Well, you know I do have a very salty
variety myself. I'll summon the falchion in my hand.

03:09:22.300 --> 03:09:28.645
MATT: The falchion appears. At which point, the
head curls back and one of the arms (loud impact).

03:09:28.645 --> 03:09:32.785
You hear coins scatter as the impact sends bits of
its loot across the stone floor and into the

03:09:32.785 --> 03:09:41.750
shadows around. "Ah. It's been a while since my
food has played back."

03:09:44.218 --> 03:09:51.714
TRAVIS: Now listen, I don't want to disturb you
any further. I'm just going to see myself out

03:09:51.714 --> 03:10:03.268
stage left over here. You have a nice day and
enjoy your vast fortune. I'll start to walk

03:10:03.268 --> 03:10:06.960
towards that left tunnel.

03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:11.768
MATT: Okay. As soon as you turn, you hear another
(loud impact) as the other arm impacts. The ground

03:10:11.768 --> 03:10:16.266
shakes a little beneath you. Make a perception
check with disadvantage because you're scared as shit.

03:10:16.266 --> 03:10:21.338
TRAVIS: Where'd you get that impression? Natural
one!

03:10:21.969 --> 03:10:24.321
MATT: You can't even focus. Your eyes blur for a
moment.

03:10:24.321 --> 03:10:26.082
TRAVIS: Yeah, small tears.

03:10:26.082 --> 03:10:27.775
LIAM: You got the jake legs.

03:10:27.775 --> 03:10:39.329
MATT: It stands there and goes, "Halas has not
returned in an age. You shall keep me entertained

03:10:39.329 --> 03:10:41.327
"for now."

03:10:41.327 --> 03:10:48.963
TRAVIS: That's funny, I've actually heard that
name before, Halas. We saw some of his belongings.

03:10:48.963 --> 03:10:55.888
Before you devour me like a tiny little shrimp,
would you mind a small request in letting me know

03:10:55.888 --> 03:10:58.137
who that person was?

03:10:58.137 --> 03:11:00.156
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:11:00.156 --> 03:11:07.395
TRAVIS: I am charismatic. (squealing) 23! Natural
19.

03:11:07.825 --> 03:11:11.559
MATT: Still standing, you glance over your
shoulder and you can see now its form. It's maybe,

03:11:11.559 --> 03:11:18.905
from wing tip to wing tip, about 20 or so feet.
The body itself is not incredibly massive. This is

03:11:18.905 --> 03:11:24.901
a younger dragon, but it's still a fucking
dragon.

03:11:24.901 --> 03:11:30.889
TRAVIS: Cool when there are six others, seven
others. (panicked mumbling)

03:11:30.889 --> 03:11:37.105
MATT: It turns its head curiously towards you and
breathes. As it does, you watch these crackling

03:11:37.105 --> 03:11:44.395
blue bolts between its teeth, arcing between the
jaws. It opens up slightly, the tongue running

03:11:44.395 --> 03:11:53.398
itself over the front. "I don't know where he
walks these days. It's been a while, but we have

03:11:53.398 --> 03:11:55.026
"an arrangement."

03:11:56.994 --> 03:12:00.090
TRAVIS: An arrangement, you and he?

03:12:00.090 --> 03:12:11.515
MATT: "Yes. I keep watch on some of his
surroundings and he sends me food and gifts. One

03:12:11.515 --> 03:12:20.555
"day I'll be big enough to eat him and this will
all be mine. But until then, I'm fine with the flattery."

03:12:22.475 --> 03:12:28.457
TRAVIS: How does he send you these, I assume,
incredible gifts?

03:12:28.457 --> 03:12:31.892
MATT: "He leaves little pockets around the
world."

03:12:33.591 --> 03:12:42.576
TRAVIS: I don't want to bring up a touchy subject,
but I feel like your friend might be dead.

03:12:44.594 --> 03:12:55.073
MATT: He thinks for a second to himself. "Time
does move strangely chamber to chamber here. If he

03:12:55.073 --> 03:13:00.708
"is, well, I guess that makes me lord of the
manor."

03:13:00.708 --> 03:13:03.643
MARISHA: Oh no.

03:13:03.643 --> 03:13:07.434
MATT: You hear another-- (footsteps)

03:13:07.434 --> 03:13:12.145
TRAVIS: Manor? Are we in a house?

03:13:12.570 --> 03:13:21.389
MATT: "More or less." (footsteps) "If you can call
the hundred or so chambers here a house."

03:13:21.389 --> 03:13:27.956
TRAVIS: Jeez. You know, I hate to leave you
without a friend. I mean, if this guy's up and

03:13:27.956 --> 03:13:33.330
left you high and dry, maybe I could offer my
services.

03:13:33.330 --> 03:13:41.332
MATT: Make a persuasion check. Roll fucking high.

03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:44.516
TRAVIS: 14.

03:13:44.516 --> 03:13:58.491
MATT: He goes, "Huh. I appreciate the offer, but I
tend to work solo and let's be honest, I'm

03:13:58.491 --> 03:14:06.674
"hungry." There are a few flashes from the center
of the above hallway as a few bodies fall through.

03:14:07.020 --> 03:14:14.434
Beau and Jester both come falling through, Bill
and Ted style. Both of you guys make acrobatics

03:14:14.434 --> 03:14:15.761
checks for me.

03:14:15.761 --> 03:14:16.950
TRAVIS: I was trying to draw that shit out--

03:14:16.950 --> 03:14:17.676
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:14:17.676 --> 03:14:19.947
MATT: You three-point land.

03:14:19.947 --> 03:14:22.945
MARISHA: You're good! 12!

03:14:22.945 --> 03:14:27.395
MATT: You three-point land. (bones cracking)
(screams)

03:14:27.395 --> 03:14:33.636
TRAVIS: You have no idea how happy I am to see
you. Dragon!

03:14:33.636 --> 03:14:42.196
MATT: Five point of bludgeoning damage to you. As
you land, the dragon rears up, caught off guard,

03:14:42.196 --> 03:14:45.978
wings up in the air. I'm going to pull the map
out.

03:14:45.978 --> 03:14:49.200
(cheering)

03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:56.632
SAM: Oh my god. D&amp;D Beyond.

03:14:56.632 --> 03:14:58.570
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:14:58.570 --> 03:15:00.472
MARISHA: This feels like a lot.

03:15:00.472 --> 03:15:05.877
TRAVIS: Damn it. Ooh!

03:15:05.877 --> 03:15:10.901
TALIESIN: Turn it around this way. Oh boy.

03:15:11.425 --> 03:15:20.235
MATT: For this, Jester landed there. Fjord--
sorry, Beau is prone there.

03:15:20.235 --> 03:15:25.547
TRAVIS: I started to take a step to the left while
facing the dragon.

03:15:25.547 --> 03:15:30.286
MATT: And the dragon is right there.

03:15:30.502 --> 03:15:34.803
LAURA: Okay. The minute he rears up, I'm going to
Invoke Duplicity again.

03:15:34.803 --> 03:15:36.937
MATT: Well, let's roll initiative first.

03:15:47.207 --> 03:15:50.699
TALIESIN: There's a lot happening here.

03:15:51.283 --> 03:15:52.766
MATT: Rolled really shitty initiative.

03:15:52.766 --> 03:15:53.453
TRAVIS: Did he?

03:15:53.453 --> 03:15:57.474
MATT: Yeah. He rolled a two. 25 to 20?

03:15:57.474 --> 03:16:00.457
LIAM: Only those present?

03:16:00.457 --> 03:16:02.853
MATT: Yeah, only those present. 20 to 15?

03:16:02.853 --> 03:16:03.717
TRAVIS: 16.

03:16:03.717 --> 03:16:05.189
MARISHA: 15.

03:16:05.728 --> 03:16:07.448
LAURA: Six.

03:16:07.448 --> 03:16:11.476
TALIESIN and DEBORAH: Oh boy.

03:16:11.476 --> 03:16:13.702
MATT: Six for Jester?

03:16:13.702 --> 03:16:14.381
LAURA: Yeah.

03:16:14.381 --> 03:16:21.587
TRAVIS: Why do warlocks only have two fucking
spell slots right now?

03:16:24.853 --> 03:16:32.583
MATT: Top of the round. Fjord, you're up. Looking
down at the end of this chamber, it's dark.

03:16:32.583 --> 03:16:37.341
There's no light source, but you have darkvision.
To perceive anything in there, you have to make an

03:16:37.341 --> 03:16:46.431
action, but it's up to you. So your choice right
now is focus on the dragon or explore your surroundings.

03:16:49.163 --> 03:16:56.190
TRAVIS: I'm going to focus on the dragon because
my friends are here and I'm going to cast Blink.

03:16:56.853 --> 03:17:04.726
MATT: Okay. Over there, we're going to throw the--
Is Blink concentration?

03:17:04.726 --> 03:17:07.660
TRAVIS: It is not.

03:17:08.084 --> 03:17:11.917
MATT: Correct. So you're not even concentrating.
All right, cool. So you cast Blink on yourself.

03:17:11.917 --> 03:17:17.478
TRAVIS: And with my bonus action, I will set
Hexblade's Curse on that blue dragon.

03:17:17.478 --> 03:17:21.176
SAM: (exaggerated Southern accent) Hexblade's
Curse.

03:17:21.608 --> 03:17:28.415
MATT: As you cast on yourself and turn around,
releasing your hand towards it, the shadows from

03:17:28.415 --> 03:17:35.666
the nearby area cling to it like chunks of a
venomous symbiote for a second. As they grind into

03:17:35.666 --> 03:17:38.079
the corners of where its body is, the curse takes
effect.

03:17:38.579 --> 03:17:40.054
TRAVIS: All right.

03:17:40.054 --> 03:17:45.555
MATT: That's the end of your turn, so I think you
get to roll, right?

03:17:46.368 --> 03:17:48.507
TRAVIS: No. Blink was my action.

03:17:48.507 --> 03:17:50.060
MATT: Correct, but at the end of each of your
turns--

03:17:50.060 --> 03:18:02.059
TRAVIS: Oh, I do. I roll. Yep. That is 11.

03:18:02.059 --> 03:18:09.702
MATT: On 11 or higher, you vanish from the current
plane. That's where you were. You disappear. That

03:18:09.702 --> 03:18:15.037
ends your go. Beau, you're up. You're on the
ground. Looking around, there's a dragon there.

03:18:15.037 --> 03:18:18.752
Fjord turns this way and vanishes. There's two of
these darkened hallways. What are you doing?

03:18:18.752 --> 03:18:28.247
MARISHA: I turn to Jester and I go: Fjord just
fucking vanished again! And I go: I don't know how

03:18:28.247 --> 03:18:40.645
this works! I take out the red elemental gem that
I've had for a very long time, and I... use it. I was

03:18:40.862 --> 03:18:47.535
going to say I smash it, but then I felt that
might be deeply irresponsible because then it

03:18:47.535 --> 03:18:49.823
could just smash.

03:18:49.823 --> 03:18:52.734
LAURA: Maybe you can punch him with the gem.

03:18:52.734 --> 03:18:55.108
SAM: Punch the gem at him.

03:18:55.108 --> 03:18:57.529
MARISHA: Badminton.

03:18:58.419 --> 03:19:03.292
MATT: Red elemental gem. A fire elemental is
summoned as if you cast the Conjure Elemental

03:19:03.292 --> 03:19:09.553
spell, and the gem's magic is lost. So as you
throw it, it shatters. I don't have a fire

03:19:09.553 --> 03:19:15.423
elemental thing on me, so we'll use this for the
time being. As you throw it, it breaks on the

03:19:15.423 --> 03:19:20.675
ground there. Suddenly, rising from the impact,
the flames swirl and build up into a full-fledged

03:19:20.675 --> 03:19:24.187
fire elemental beneath.

03:19:24.187 --> 03:19:26.751
MARISHA: I go: Fuck him up!

03:19:26.751 --> 03:19:30.273
MATT: As for the Conjure Elemental spell, let's
see if it gets its action right now.

03:19:30.273 --> 03:19:32.290
TRAVIS: Just hope it listens to what you say.

03:19:32.290 --> 03:19:38.245
MARISHA: God, well, I think it's one of those
things where, if something bad happens, it turns on us.

03:19:38.245 --> 03:19:40.036
DEBORAH: I think it does. I think it's
concentration.

03:19:40.036 --> 03:19:42.774
MARISHA: Yeah, if I lose concentration, but I
don't know--

03:19:42.774 --> 03:19:46.786
MATT: Yeah, it is concentration, so you're
considered concentrating right now. It's friendly

03:19:46.786 --> 03:19:48.979
to you and your companions. Roll initiative for
the elemental.

03:19:48.979 --> 03:19:53.927
MARISHA: Okay. What do I-- that's not good.

03:19:53.927 --> 03:19:55.908
MATT: Do you have stats for the elemental?

03:19:55.908 --> 03:19:59.592
MARISHA: Nope. I did when I was a druid.

03:19:59.592 --> 03:20:03.548
MATT: It's okay. I'll find it right now for you,
and I'll text it to you.

03:20:03.548 --> 03:20:06.367
MARISHA: I can also use D&amp;D Beyond.

03:20:06.367 --> 03:20:10.398
MATT: Yeah, do that. Pull up the fire elemental
there. Initiative, what's the number on there?

03:20:10.398 --> 03:20:12.871
MARISHA: Search. What's his initiative?

03:20:12.871 --> 03:20:14.458
LIAM: You rolled a six.

03:20:14.458 --> 03:20:15.681
MARISHA: Uh-huh. What's his dex?

03:20:15.681 --> 03:20:17.116
LIAM: Plus his dex, so nine total.

03:20:17.116 --> 03:20:18.762
MARISHA: Nine. Nein.

03:20:18.762 --> 03:20:28.540
MATT: You got it. That's your action. Your
movement? You're still prone.

03:20:28.540 --> 03:20:30.443
MARISHA: So I stand.

03:20:30.443 --> 03:20:34.057
MATT: Okay. Half your movement.

03:20:34.057 --> 03:20:45.077
MARISHA: I'm going to back up towards this alcove
a little bit, right behind me. Yep. I'm going to

03:20:45.077 --> 03:20:48.799
use my bonus action to take Patient Defense.

03:20:48.799 --> 03:20:55.419
MATT: You got it. Okay. That ends your turn. The
fire elemental's turn now. It goes. It is next in

03:20:55.419 --> 03:20:56.787
the initiative order.

03:20:56.787 --> 03:21:04.668
MARISHA: Okay, I would like for it to get up to it
and to do melee attacks.

03:21:04.668 --> 03:21:07.200
MATT: Go for it.

03:21:07.200 --> 03:21:08.974
LAURA: Is the dragon still on the ground, or is
it--

03:21:08.974 --> 03:21:12.965
MATT: It's still on the ground. The mini has it
flying up, but it hasn't risen yet.

03:21:12.965 --> 03:21:22.025
MARISHA: Hang on, sorry. I'm going to do the
multiattack, so two touch attacks. First one,

03:21:22.025 --> 03:21:26.743
that's okay. Wait, what am I? Sorry.

03:21:26.743 --> 03:21:30.084
LIAM: Plus that. Plus six for your touch attack,
so 18.

03:21:30.084 --> 03:21:33.236
MATT: 18 just hits.

03:21:33.236 --> 03:21:36.072
TRAVIS: It lights up this place for you big time.

03:21:36.072 --> 03:21:38.155
MARISHA: 18 is the dragon's AC.

03:21:38.155 --> 03:21:40.292
MATT: Correct. Does it catch fire?

03:21:40.292 --> 03:21:49.938
MARISHA: And then one more attack. Oh, yes, and it
does 2d6 plus three, which is five plus three.

03:21:49.938 --> 03:21:58.980
Eight, and it does catch on fire. Then it's going
to do another attack, which, I think it fails. It

03:21:58.980 --> 03:22:00.313
definitely fails.

03:22:00.313 --> 03:22:03.499
MATT: Okay, that's the end of the fire elemental's
turn. Is it going to stay there or going to move?

03:22:03.499 --> 03:22:07.185
MARISHA: No, it's going to stay there and be like:
What's up, I'm a fire elemental.

03:22:07.185 --> 03:22:08.674
MATT: Jester, you're up.

03:22:08.674 --> 03:22:18.666
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians on
myself.

03:22:18.666 --> 03:22:28.880
MATT: Okay. You are now concentrating on Spirit
Guardians. It's a wisdom save for the dragon. Is

03:22:28.880 --> 03:22:32.845
it friendly? Oh, look at that. Thank you for
pulling that out for me. Even better.

03:22:32.845 --> 03:22:36.568
SAM: Fire elemental. All the toys.

03:22:36.568 --> 03:22:41.461
MATT: You're amazing. That's a wisdom saving
throw, right?

03:22:41.461 --> 03:22:42.919
LAURA: Yeah.

03:22:42.919 --> 03:22:45.536
MATT: It rolled a natural 17 plus one, so 18.

03:22:45.536 --> 03:22:46.851
LAURA: So it saves.

03:22:46.851 --> 03:22:48.006
MATT: It takes half damage, though.

03:22:48.006 --> 03:22:49.585
LAURA: Okay, so do I roll damage right now?

03:22:49.585 --> 03:22:50.524
MATT: You do.

03:22:50.524 --> 03:22:55.298
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. No, I think it's at the
top of its turn, isn't it, that you said?

03:22:55.298 --> 03:22:58.061
TALIESIN: I think manifest and then on the top of
its turn.

03:22:58.061 --> 03:22:59.123
MATT: That's what I thought it was.

03:22:59.123 --> 03:22:59.773
LAURA: Okay.

03:22:59.773 --> 03:23:02.690
TALIESIN: It's both. Oh boy.

03:23:02.690 --> 03:23:06.954
MATT: Wait. An affected creature-- no, it's when
it start its turn. You're right. We'll come back to it.

03:23:06.954 --> 03:23:11.228
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to back up.

03:23:11.228 --> 03:23:13.680
MATT: Okay. Which direction?

03:23:13.680 --> 03:23:28.350
LAURA: The opposite direction that Fjord went.
Yeah, to about there. I can't do anything for a

03:23:28.350 --> 03:23:34.722
bonus action right now, can I? I can't dodge or
something as a bonus action?

03:23:34.722 --> 03:23:37.927
MATT: No, it's an action, unfortunately. Only Beau
gets to do that because she's a cool monk.

03:23:37.927 --> 03:23:43.809
LAURA: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, then I'm
going to chill out and say: Oh no.

03:23:43.809 --> 03:23:46.007
MATT: Okay. That ends your go.

03:23:46.007 --> 03:23:50.722
LAURA: Oh wait! Oh, I backed up. That's okay.

03:23:50.722 --> 03:23:56.981
MATT: Well, the dragon is going to take its turn.
The dragon is going to turn this way as it moves

03:23:56.981 --> 03:24:00.940
around the fire elemental that struck it. First,
it takes d6 damage, right, from being on fire?

03:24:00.940 --> 03:24:02.849
MARISHA: It takes d10 damage.

03:24:02.849 --> 03:24:05.316
MATT: d10 damage. Roll a d10.

03:24:05.316 --> 03:24:07.005
MARISHA: Eight!

03:24:07.005 --> 03:24:14.112
MATT: Eight points of damage. "Insolent
creatures." (footsteps) Turns around on the fire

03:24:14.112 --> 03:24:21.563
elemental and releases this burst of electrical
energy. This lightning bolt arcs from the front of

03:24:21.563 --> 03:24:26.514
its snout or channeled the horn through the fire
elemental and towards Beau.

03:24:26.514 --> 03:24:28.730
MARISHA: Okay.

03:24:28.730 --> 03:24:34.447
MATT: Spirit Guardians...

03:24:34.447 --> 03:24:38.553
MARISHA: I have Patient Defense.

03:24:38.553 --> 03:24:42.253
MATT: Correct, so you're too far away from it. So
it doesn't take any damage. Patient Defense

03:24:42.253 --> 03:24:47.883
doesn't do anything. You have to make a dexterity
saving throw, and the fire elemental does as well.

03:24:47.883 --> 03:24:57.330
MARISHA: Okay. Dexterity saving throw. Okay. 21.

03:24:57.330 --> 03:25:01.745
MATT: That's a success. Roll for the fire
elemental.

03:25:01.745 --> 03:25:05.906
MARISHA: Can I use evasion, or does that matter
right now?

03:25:05.906 --> 03:25:08.037
MATT: Evasion happens-- oh yeah, so you take no
damage.

03:25:08.037 --> 03:25:09.426
MARISHA: I take no damage. Evasion, yeah.

03:25:09.426 --> 03:25:13.624
MATT: You take no damage. Roll a dexterity saving
throw for the fire elemental. You duck out of the

03:25:13.624 --> 03:25:16.590
way. It strikes the wall, the stone exploding from
the impact.

03:25:16.590 --> 03:25:18.900
MARISHA: Not good.

03:25:18.900 --> 03:25:21.191
MATT: The fire elemental takes 55 points of
lightning damage.

03:25:21.191 --> 03:25:23.177
ALL: Ooh!

03:25:23.177 --> 03:25:25.252
TRAVIS: Fifty-fucking-five?!

03:25:25.252 --> 03:25:30.026
LAURA: Get the fuck out! That would kill us
instantly if it hits us! At least, it would almost

03:25:30.026 --> 03:25:31.826
kill me instantly.

03:25:31.826 --> 03:25:33.232
LIAM: It would kill me.

03:25:33.232 --> 03:25:38.656
TRAVIS: (screaming) Oh, Matthew!

03:25:38.656 --> 03:25:40.805
SAM: Why would you do this to Deborah Ann Woll?

03:25:40.805 --> 03:25:42.389
TRAVIS: I'm sorry I touched the window!

03:25:42.389 --> 03:25:48.878
DEBORAH: Deborah Ann Woll has a plan! Get to where
I fall in! I'm still in inter-dimensional space!

03:25:48.878 --> 03:25:50.905
MARISHA: You said 57 damage?

03:25:50.905 --> 03:25:51.953
MATT: Correct.

03:25:51.953 --> 03:25:53.107
MARISHA: 52 damage?

03:25:53.107 --> 03:25:55.336
MATT: 52 damage. No, I'm sorry, 55.

03:25:55.336 --> 03:26:01.013
SAM: Maybe we can give it the rotten drug fruit
that we have.

03:26:01.013 --> 03:26:05.286
MATT: It's going to then fly back around to get a
better area. This is actually going to take up in

03:26:05.286 --> 03:26:06.886
the air.

03:26:06.886 --> 03:26:09.312
LIAM: How high is the ceiling in here?

03:26:09.312 --> 03:26:13.938
MATT: The ceiling is 20 feet, so it gets to max at
the very top. It's ten feet above anybody, so it's

03:26:13.938 --> 03:26:18.253
out of melee range unless somebody can get to the
top.

03:26:18.253 --> 03:26:19.587
MARISHA: Wow. This is bad.

03:26:19.587 --> 03:26:20.560
TRAVIS: Boom! Ah!

03:26:20.560 --> 03:26:22.689
MARISHA: I have evasion. That's the only reason
I'm okay.

03:26:22.689 --> 03:26:24.721
LIAM: Wait, that seems much higher than 20 feet.

03:26:24.721 --> 03:26:28.192
MATT: It's 20 feet. It's right there.

03:26:28.192 --> 03:26:30.113
LIAM: It's hovering above. Thanks.

03:26:30.113 --> 03:26:33.792
MATT: The mini looks like it's flying when it's
not. Now it's flying. It's at the base level.

03:26:33.792 --> 03:26:35.116
LIAM: I'm with you now.

03:26:35.116 --> 03:26:39.129
MATT: The fire elemental does get an attack of
opportunity as it moves out of its range.

03:26:39.129 --> 03:26:40.921
Shrugs it off.

03:26:40.921 --> 03:26:44.233
MARISHA: Okay. Yes, it hits. I rolled a 17.

03:26:44.233 --> 03:26:45.488
MATT: 17 just misses.

03:26:45.488 --> 03:26:48.640
MARISHA: No, a natural 17 plus six.

03:26:48.640 --> 03:26:50.528
MATT: It does hit. Roll damage.

03:26:50.528 --> 03:26:52.244
TRAVIS: 17 misses?

03:26:52.244 --> 03:26:55.435
MATT: The flames are burning around its body. It
doesn't even pay attention.

03:26:55.435 --> 03:26:58.415
TRAVIS: Get me the fuck out of here. We're level
seven. Why did we do this?

03:26:58.415 --> 03:26:59.554
SAM: You did it!

03:26:59.554 --> 03:27:01.940
MARISHA: Ten damage.

03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:11.628
MATT: Ten damage. Not bad. That's top of the
round, so (approaching screams). Next up, I

03:27:11.628 --> 03:27:14.957
believe, was it Caduceus first?

03:27:14.957 --> 03:27:16.671
DEBORAH: Did you go first, and then I went after
you?

03:27:16.671 --> 03:27:17.889
TALIESIN: I think we went-- we may have--

03:27:17.889 --> 03:27:18.857
MATT: In the same round.

03:27:18.857 --> 03:27:19.901
DEBORAH: Same round, yeah.

03:27:19.901 --> 03:27:23.103
MATT: Yeah, so we'll say both of you guys drop.
Both of you roll initiative. First of all,

03:27:23.103 --> 03:27:25.016
acrobatics check.

03:27:25.016 --> 03:27:26.691
LIAM: Two minutes later.

03:27:26.691 --> 03:27:27.907
SAM: We got some books.

03:27:27.907 --> 03:27:28.972
MATT: Yeah, you read some books.

03:27:28.972 --> 03:27:30.171
DEBORAH: 14 for me, acrobatics.

03:27:30.171 --> 03:27:31.524
MATT: Okay, 14. You're fine.

03:27:31.524 --> 03:27:31.828
TALIESIN: 19.

03:27:31.828 --> 03:27:36.399
MATT: 19. You both are fine, so you land. You
actually fall past the dragon. (screams)

03:27:36.399 --> 03:27:38.472
TALIESIN: Oh boy!

03:27:38.472 --> 03:27:45.894
MATT: You land on the ground like, "What?!" (wings
flapping) There's a fire elemental burning over

03:27:45.894 --> 03:27:52.533
here on the side. It's absolute chaos. Both of you
guys now roll initiative. See where you end

03:27:52.533 --> 03:27:55.175
up on the initiative order.

03:27:55.316 --> 03:27:56.642
TALIESIN: 18.

03:27:56.642 --> 03:27:58.171
MATT: 18. Caduceus is up first.

03:27:58.171 --> 03:27:59.191
DEBORAH: 13 for me.

03:27:59.258 --> 03:28:10.834
MATT: And 13. So top of the round, Caduceus,
you're up first. Fjord is nowhere to be seen. You

03:28:10.903 --> 03:28:15.138
can see this giant shadowy mark on the stone where
electricity is dissipating and Beau looks like she

03:28:15.138 --> 03:28:17.747
just saw a ghost, maybe shit herself.

03:28:17.747 --> 03:28:20.806
MARISHA: Hey, speak for yourself!

03:28:20.806 --> 03:28:25.320
MATT: Just the look! I'm not saying you did, but
you have the look. Jester is surrounded by

03:28:25.320 --> 03:28:30.335
sparkling unicorns and is just like, "Uh!" What
are you doing?

03:28:30.335 --> 03:28:36.973
TALIESIN: Oh wow! Fuck it, I'm going to try it.
I'm going to try to cast Bane on this thing.

03:28:36.973 --> 03:28:39.190
MATT: Okay.

03:28:39.190 --> 03:28:40.944
TALIESIN: Is that insane? I don't know if that's
insane.

03:28:40.944 --> 03:28:42.197
MATT: Saving throw is?

03:28:42.197 --> 03:28:44.383
TALIESIN: It's a 16 Charisma. That may be insane.

03:28:44.383 --> 03:28:47.676
MATT: Charisma. Plus three. That's a ten. It
fails.

03:28:47.676 --> 03:28:50.141
TRAVIS: Yeah! That was a good gamble!

03:28:50.141 --> 03:28:55.703
MATT: So that now has Bane on it. Boop! All the
circles!

03:28:55.703 --> 03:29:03.422
TALIESIN: That means attacks and save rolls are
now a d4 negative.

03:29:03.422 --> 03:29:04.509
MATT: Correct.

03:29:04.509 --> 03:29:05.386
TALIESIN: All right.

03:29:05.386 --> 03:29:06.265
LIAM: Nice!

03:29:06.265 --> 03:29:10.575
MATT: Bane on that. I'll make that a yellow one.
There we go.

03:29:10.575 --> 03:29:12.281
LAURA: Is it a negative d4?

03:29:12.281 --> 03:29:17.208
MATT: Negative d4 to all its attacks and saving
throws. So you cast that, and then you have your

03:29:17.208 --> 03:29:19.898
movement and bonus.

03:29:19.898 --> 03:29:28.526
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to turn invisible.

03:29:28.526 --> 03:29:33.637
TRAVIS: We're all bouncing!

03:29:33.637 --> 03:29:39.966
MATT: Nope, nope, nope!

03:29:39.966 --> 03:29:41.762
TRAVIS: The monk's like, "Really?!"

03:29:41.762 --> 03:29:44.823
MARISHA: Where are all my friends? Bullshit!

03:29:44.823 --> 03:29:47.207
MATT: (singing) Where has Fjord the cowboy gone?

03:29:47.207 --> 03:29:54.945
TALIESIN: I'm going to run towards--

03:29:56.449 --> 03:29:58.260
MATT: Towards Jester?

03:29:58.683 --> 03:30:01.069
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm closer to that hallway.
Yeah, I see them over there. I'm going to run

03:30:01.069 --> 03:30:02.385
towards that hallway full speed.

03:30:02.385 --> 03:30:03.194
MATT: This one, or this one?

03:30:03.194 --> 03:30:05.205
TALIESIN: This one.

03:30:05.205 --> 03:30:08.199
MATT: Okay, so (counting) 30.

03:30:08.199 --> 03:30:09.451
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:30:09.451 --> 03:30:18.425
MATT: It is dark in this hallway. There's no light
source, so just be aware. That ends your turn.

03:30:18.425 --> 03:30:21.511
Fjord, you're going to appear ten feet from where
you were.

03:30:21.511 --> 03:30:23.757
TRAVIS: Ten feet closer to the end of the
hallway.

03:30:23.757 --> 03:30:25.696
MATT: You appear there.

03:30:25.696 --> 03:30:32.951
TRAVIS: I will use all 30 feet of my movement to
head toward the end to see what the fuck's down here.

03:30:32.951 --> 03:30:42.089
MATT: You rush up to the very end, and you come
upon a small alcove and a small crystal, a faint

03:30:42.089 --> 03:30:51.644
turquoise green-blue coloration to it. Similar to
the flash that consumed the room when the sphere

03:30:51.644 --> 03:30:59.138
was being puzzled. There looks to be a groove
running across and down the base of it, and across

03:30:59.138 --> 03:31:02.880
the floor, and you glance over and there's a
groove running all the way down the hallway across

03:31:02.880 --> 03:31:03.825
the floor.

03:31:03.825 --> 03:31:05.384
LIAM: Give it to Fjord, he'll touch anything!

03:31:05.384 --> 03:31:08.019
SAM: (laughter) He will!

03:31:08.019 --> 03:31:14.301
MATT: The crystal is dull. It is dark and it is
just there.

03:31:14.602 --> 03:31:21.731
TRAVIS: Did I learn anything? I don't know what to
do. I'll turn around and I'll fire two Eldritch

03:31:21.731 --> 03:31:23.546
Blasts at the dragon.

03:31:23.546 --> 03:31:26.475
MATT: All righty. Roll for an attack twice.

03:31:27.354 --> 03:31:33.982
TRAVIS: I hope that'll fucking hit. That is a 24?

03:31:33.982 --> 03:31:35.055
MATT: 24 hits.

03:31:35.055 --> 03:31:37.553
TRAVIS: Great. Second one is 23.

03:31:37.553 --> 03:31:39.105
MATT: Both hit! Roll damage.

03:31:39.105 --> 03:31:46.671
TRAVIS: Oh great, that's 16 points of Eldritch
Blast.

03:31:46.671 --> 03:31:47.857
MATT: Nice!

03:31:47.857 --> 03:31:52.863
TRAVIS: And 12 points of Eldritch.

03:31:52.863 --> 03:31:58.429
MATT: As you peer and run down the side, turning
around and firing these bolts out, they light up

03:31:58.429 --> 03:32:03.734
the hallway as they arc past, blasting into the
side of the scaled armor as they both hit. The

03:32:03.734 --> 03:32:10.618
blasts hit and take damage, but it's a dragon. It
looks over, "I see you, morsel."

03:32:10.618 --> 03:32:14.302
TRAVIS: No, you don't! You do! Four!

03:32:15.419 --> 03:32:19.236
MATT: It flickers in and out, and you're still
standing there.

03:32:19.236 --> 03:32:23.105
TRAVIS: Shit! (screams)

03:32:23.105 --> 03:32:24.543
MATT: You added your curse damage on that, right?

03:32:24.543 --> 03:32:25.224
TRAVIS: What's that?

03:32:25.224 --> 03:32:26.112
MATT: You add your curse damage?

03:32:26.112 --> 03:32:27.249
TRAVIS: I did. Yeah, the plus three to each time.

03:32:27.249 --> 03:32:31.238
MATT: That ends your turn, Fjord. Beauregard,
you're up.

03:32:31.238 --> 03:32:35.546
MARISHA: I saw Fjord dart that way, and I heard
screams coming from that way--

03:32:35.546 --> 03:32:37.486
TRAVIS: They were manly screams!

03:32:37.486 --> 03:32:46.300
MARISHA: Manly screams! I'm going to run this way
past Jester and check out this hall. My speed is 45.

03:32:46.300 --> 03:32:48.050
MATT: (counting)

03:32:48.050 --> 03:32:49.236
MARISHA: What do I see?

03:32:49.236 --> 03:32:53.870
MATT: You get there. You see this small alcove
with a green-blue crystal that's resting there,

03:32:53.870 --> 03:32:59.044
and a groove that's running along the ground and
across the wall and continues all the way down the

03:32:59.044 --> 03:33:03.931
length of the hall. You turn around and can see
that both of them meet in the center, and then go

03:33:03.931 --> 03:33:06.481
in towards the platform in the middle.

03:33:06.481 --> 03:33:11.424
MARISHA: In towards the platform or the casket?
What's with the casket situation? I don't know.

03:33:11.424 --> 03:33:16.050
MATT: This was the raised pedestal you saw behind
the dragon. You guys haven't even looked at that

03:33:16.050 --> 03:33:18.735
yet because you just saw a dragon and fucking
ran.

03:33:18.735 --> 03:33:26.042
MARISHA: Into the platform. I'm going to touch it!
I'm going to touch the crystal.

03:33:26.042 --> 03:33:28.055
MATT: Okay. You touch the crystal. It's cold.

03:33:28.055 --> 03:33:29.751
MARISHA: Did anything happen?

03:33:29.751 --> 03:33:30.459
MATT: No.

03:33:30.459 --> 03:33:32.433
MARISHA: I go: (shouting) Work!-- into it.

03:33:32.433 --> 03:33:33.665
MATT: Okay.

03:33:33.665 --> 03:33:37.392
MARISHA: (shouting) Energy! No? Okay.

03:33:37.392 --> 03:33:38.354
MATT: Nothing.

03:33:38.354 --> 03:33:44.229
MARISHA: I have a bonus action? I'm going to use
my bonus action to cast another ki point to do

03:33:44.229 --> 03:33:53.610
Step of the Wind and dash back towards the
pedestal.

03:33:53.610 --> 03:33:55.363
MATT: (counting)

03:33:55.363 --> 03:33:57.802
MARISHA: To the pedestal. That's-- yeah.

03:33:57.802 --> 03:34:01.302
MATT: All right. You're underneath the dragon now,
feeling the wind blowing down from the wings,

03:34:01.302 --> 03:34:06.868
scattering dust and bone pieces around. You're
having to squint your eyes from the bit of debris

03:34:06.868 --> 03:34:08.675
that's being kicked up from its wings.

03:34:08.675 --> 03:34:13.173
MARISHA: As I dart by Jester, I go: fucking
crystals! And that's it.

03:34:13.173 --> 03:34:15.293
LAURA: I know, right?

03:34:15.293 --> 03:34:20.810
MATT: That finishes Beau's go. Twiggy, you're up.
You see Beau vanish down and come back, "Fucking

03:34:20.810 --> 03:34:22.357
"crystals, right?"

03:34:22.357 --> 03:34:28.862
DEBORAH: Now I heard it yell at whatever-- down
this line-- I can't see that it's him, though.

03:34:28.862 --> 03:34:31.603
MATT: At this distance-- You have darkvision 60
feet, right?

03:34:31.603 --> 03:34:32.609
DEBORAH: I do have darkvision.

03:34:32.609 --> 03:34:33.828
MATT: You can see him down there.

03:34:33.828 --> 03:34:38.003
DEBORAH: Okay, I see Fjord down there. Is it
conceivable that he's fairly distracted with this,

03:34:38.003 --> 03:34:39.729
and he's not paying that much attention to me?

03:34:39.729 --> 03:34:42.801
MATT: It's conceivable. You're a tiny little
thing.

03:34:42.801 --> 03:34:44.106
DEBORAH: I'm a tiny little thing.

03:34:44.106 --> 03:34:45.228
MATT: That hasn't done anything yet.

03:34:45.228 --> 03:34:53.444
DEBORAH: I'm so little. I'm going to attempt to
hide from his sight. That hides me, so I use my

03:34:53.444 --> 03:34:58.612
bonus action to just get hidden a little bit. Is
there anything I can--

03:34:58.612 --> 03:35:02.550
MATT: Unfortunately, you are next to a very bright
fire elemental that is lighting up the area. You

03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:05.104
might have to creatively use the space. There are
outcroppings--

03:35:05.104 --> 03:35:06.487
DEBORAH: Go to the outcropping.

03:35:06.487 --> 03:35:08.484
MATT: You'd have to move into another area to try
and get--

03:35:08.484 --> 03:35:12.606
DEBORAH: All right, I'm not adjacent to it because
it's up, right?

03:35:12.606 --> 03:35:13.304
MATT: Correct.

03:35:13.304 --> 03:35:15.423
DEBORAH: Okay, I'll back into that alcove and
attempt to hide in the alcove.

03:35:15.423 --> 03:35:16.545
MATT: Okay, you are small.

03:35:16.545 --> 03:35:17.927
DEBORAH: I am tiny.

03:35:17.927 --> 03:35:19.604
MATT: See if you can try it. It's going to have a
higher DC.

03:35:19.604 --> 03:35:21.866
DEBORAH: 15? To hide? Okay.

03:35:21.866 --> 03:35:23.158
MATT: You may or may not be.

03:35:23.158 --> 03:35:33.801
DEBORAH: Maybe not. We'll see. I want to cast-- I
conjure back into my imagination. I remember that

03:35:33.801 --> 03:35:41.437
portrait that was up above the desk in the other
room, and I go: Fuck, this better work! I start to

03:35:41.437 --> 03:35:47.303
bring my hand down through the top of my body, and
I make myself look like that portrait of who we

03:35:47.303 --> 03:35:56.184
think is Halas. Now, I'm only a foot taller than
myself. So I'm a four and a half-foot tall Halas.

03:35:56.184 --> 03:35:59.053
But I have a lot of presence, okay?

03:35:59.053 --> 03:36:01.618
SAM: Mini Halas.

03:36:01.618 --> 03:36:13.044
DEBORAH: I stride forward. I go, in my raspiest,
most male voice I say: Hey! You look bigger than

03:36:13.044 --> 03:36:14.731
the last time I saw you!

03:36:14.731 --> 03:36:17.677
(laughter)

03:36:17.677 --> 03:36:19.605
SAM: (as Halas) Have you put on weight?

03:36:19.605 --> 03:36:21.039
DEBORAH: You've grown!

03:36:21.039 --> 03:36:22.862
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:36:22.862 --> 03:36:25.485
DEBORAH: I'm really bad at charisma, you guys.

03:36:25.485 --> 03:36:26.992
LIAM: Roll high.

03:36:26.992 --> 03:36:28.551
TRAVIS: You got it!

03:36:28.551 --> 03:36:32.563
MARISHA: Oh, but it was so good!

03:36:32.563 --> 03:36:34.713
DEBORAH: But I'm just playing it.

03:36:34.713 --> 03:36:38.479
MATT: Yeah, you're playing it. You're owning it as
you stroll forward, creepy extended fingers and

03:36:38.479 --> 03:36:43.105
billowing robe. The dragon is like: (winging
flapping).

03:36:43.605 --> 03:36:46.237
DEBORAH: It's a nine.

03:36:46.783 --> 03:36:51.606
MATT: And just looks right back at Fjord. It's
paying about as much attention to you as it did

03:36:51.606 --> 03:36:55.600
when you arrived. So you haven't angered it.

03:36:55.600 --> 03:36:56.862
DEBORAH: I haven't angered it.

03:36:56.862 --> 03:37:02.425
MATT: But it doesn't seem to be convinced,
necessarily. Unfortunately. Dragons are pretty

03:37:02.425 --> 03:37:06.423
perceptive. Good call, though. That ends your
turn? Fire elemental's go.

03:37:06.423 --> 03:37:08.472
MARISHA: He multi-attacks.

03:37:08.472 --> 03:37:10.044
MATT: But can it fly?

03:37:10.044 --> 03:37:13.176
MARISHA: No. It can't.

03:37:13.176 --> 03:37:15.550
MATT: It's out of range, unfortunately.

03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:21.599
MARISHA: He sheds bright light in a 30-foot
radius.

03:37:22.097 --> 03:37:24.735
MATT: (burning) There you go. Does it stay put or
move anywhere?

03:37:24.735 --> 03:37:26.044
LIAM: He could hold an attack.

03:37:26.044 --> 03:37:30.924
MARISHA: Can he move forward a little bit? Yeah,
can he hold his attack in case he's in range?

03:37:30.924 --> 03:37:34.311
MATT: Sure. He can ready his attack in case the
dragon comes in range.

03:37:34.311 --> 03:37:35.044
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:37:35.044 --> 03:37:37.986
MATT: You got it. That ends its go. Jester, you're
up.

03:37:37.986 --> 03:37:40.800
SAM and DEBORAH: Come on, Jester!

03:37:40.800 --> 03:37:44.613
SAM: Disguise Self as Halas.

03:37:44.613 --> 03:37:46.735
MATT: Just fill the chamber with Halases!

03:37:46.735 --> 03:37:47.794
LAURA: I'm going to go--

03:37:47.794 --> 03:37:49.562
LIAM: Halas, Halas, Halas!

03:37:49.562 --> 03:37:56.423
LAURA: Okay, Traveler, please let this work. I'm
going to cast Polymorph on the dragon.

03:37:56.423 --> 03:38:03.289
MATT: Okay, what's the saving throw on that?

03:38:03.289 --> 03:38:06.107
LAURA: Wisdom saving throw of 15.

03:38:06.107 --> 03:38:09.548
SAM: And he's got Bane or something.

03:38:09.548 --> 03:38:12.017
MATT: And a negative d4 to that.

03:38:14.666 --> 03:38:16.289
He rolled a 15 minus three.

03:38:16.289 --> 03:38:18.973
(cheering)

03:38:18.973 --> 03:38:21.317
MATT: What do you Polymorph the dragon into?

03:38:23.151 --> 03:38:34.352
LAURA: I'm going to Polymorph him into-- oh god.
I'm going to Polymorph him into a crimson weasel.

03:38:34.352 --> 03:38:40.548
But at the same time, I'm going to go: (shouting)
Catch him! Because somebody has to catch him.

03:38:40.548 --> 03:38:41.903
SAM: Oh god, yes.

03:38:41.903 --> 03:38:44.970
MATT: Okay, just so you're aware-- roll an
intelligence check for me real fast.

03:38:44.970 --> 03:38:49.291
LAURA: Oh no. I'm really stupid, though.

03:38:49.291 --> 03:38:51.616
LIAM: You don't want to goldfish it.

03:38:51.616 --> 03:38:52.852
LAURA: A six?

03:38:52.852 --> 03:39:00.038
MATT: Okay, gotcha. It turns into this tiny
crimson weasel. I don't have a mini for that, necessarily.

03:39:00.038 --> 03:39:02.038
LAURA: Beau, do you have a reaction?

03:39:02.038 --> 03:39:04.059
MATT: Here, we'll go there. That'll work.

03:39:04.059 --> 03:39:05.924
LIAM: Missile snare?

03:39:05.924 --> 03:39:09.675
LAURA: Yeah, would it be like missile snare? Right
underneath it?

03:39:09.675 --> 03:39:13.172
MATT: It falls down ten feet.

03:39:13.172 --> 03:39:15.546
DEBORAH: Oh, it's going to take damage.

03:39:15.546 --> 03:39:17.101
LAURA: Oh, it's got too much?

03:39:17.101 --> 03:39:19.673
DEBORAH: Well, it's going to take damage, and then
it might end.

03:39:19.673 --> 03:39:25.854
MATT: It takes one point of damage. It's still in
its form, but the fire elemental is in range and

03:39:25.854 --> 03:39:29.473
is readying its attack, so fire elemental attacks
it.

03:39:30.486 --> 03:39:32.144
MARISHA: I shouldn't have readied an attack!

03:39:32.144 --> 03:39:33.557
SAM: How would you know?

03:39:33.557 --> 03:39:37.626
DEBORAH: How would you know? It's so dramatic!

03:39:38.493 --> 03:39:53.182
MARISHA: First one, yep, it hits with a 20, which
is nine points of damage. Sorry!

03:39:53.182 --> 03:39:59.483
MATT: As the elemental slams the tiny weasel, the
weasel reverts to the dragon form.

03:39:59.483 --> 03:40:03.154
MARISHA: And he gets another attack. Oh no, wait,
he can only hold one attack.

03:40:03.154 --> 03:40:06.488
MATT: Yeah, not the player. Well, no, I'll let you
guys do all of your attacks, but I'll let the

03:40:06.488 --> 03:40:07.736
enemies do it, too.

03:40:07.736 --> 03:40:09.768
MARISHA: He hits with this one, as well.

03:40:09.768 --> 03:40:10.993
MATT: All right, roll damage.

03:40:10.993 --> 03:40:13.413
MARISHA: I'm sorry!

03:40:13.413 --> 03:40:17.175
MATT: It's okay. That's the thing you have to
consider with Polymorph. You have to decide if

03:40:17.175 --> 03:40:18.978
it's going to take damage if you're going to put
it in a tiny form.

03:40:18.978 --> 03:40:20.230
LAURA: Yeah, I didn't hear--

03:40:20.230 --> 03:40:21.171
MATT: It's all good.

03:40:21.171 --> 03:40:22.466
MARISHA: 11.

03:40:22.466 --> 03:40:25.300
MATT: 11 points of damage. That was an awesome
maneuver.

03:40:25.300 --> 03:40:26.674
TRAVIS: So good.

03:40:26.674 --> 03:40:30.168
MARISHA: I mean, I shouldn't have fucking held his
attack.

03:40:30.168 --> 03:40:33.989
SAM, LAURA, and LIAM: How would you know?

03:40:33.989 --> 03:40:40.354
MATT: Yeah, it's all good. That finishes your go,
Jester. It's now the dragon's turn.

03:40:40.354 --> 03:40:41.856
LAURA: Oh wait, I want to back up.

03:40:41.856 --> 03:40:43.420
MATT: You want to back up? This way?

03:40:43.420 --> 03:40:46.678
LAURA: No, I'll stay there. Am I within 15 feet of
him if he's on the ground?

03:40:46.678 --> 03:40:52.795
MATT: Spiritual Guardians has faded because you
cast Polymorph. So you're backing up this way?

03:40:52.795 --> 03:40:56.110
LAURA: Yeah. What a giant waste.

03:40:56.110 --> 03:40:57.847
SAM: It was not.

03:40:57.847 --> 03:40:59.725
MARISHA: You've got him in range.

03:40:59.725 --> 03:41:05.442
MATT: It is. It's in range now. Now it's his turn.
It takes fire damage at the top. Roll a d10 for

03:41:05.442 --> 03:41:07.096
the fire damage.

03:41:07.096 --> 03:41:09.409
MARISHA: Six.

03:41:09.409 --> 03:41:15.483
MATT: Six points of fire damage. All right, I'm
going to roll and see. Yeah, that's a six. It gets

03:41:15.483 --> 03:41:27.464
its lightning breath back. Infuriated by the fact
that you just turned it into a tiny little weasel,

03:41:27.464 --> 03:41:36.494
it's going to turn this way and release another
arc of lightning down. I need both Beauregard and

03:41:36.524 --> 03:41:40.681
Jester to make dexterity saving throws, please.

03:41:40.681 --> 03:41:42.313
MARISHA: I can use evasion again, right?

03:41:42.313 --> 03:41:43.514
MATT: Yeah, evasion's just an ability you have.

03:41:43.514 --> 03:41:48.630
MARISHA: If I succeed. Fuck yes!

03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:50.751
TALIESIN: Wow. That was a roll.

03:41:50.751 --> 03:41:53.587
LAURA: Oh, I rolled a natural 20! I wasn't even
looking at it!

03:41:53.587 --> 03:41:56.178
MATT: All right, that's half.

03:41:56.178 --> 03:42:03.366
LAURA: And I cast Hellish Rebuke as soon as it
hits me. If I'm alive.

03:42:03.366 --> 03:42:07.612
TALIESIN: That's a lot of rolling right now,
Matthew.

03:42:07.612 --> 03:42:09.948
LIAM: It was 50-something last time.

03:42:09.948 --> 03:42:19.184
MATT: It's 51 points of lightning damage. You
succeeded, so it's halved. You take 25, and you succeeded.

03:42:19.184 --> 03:42:20.822
MARISHA: I rolled a 25 total.

03:42:20.822 --> 03:42:22.583
MATT: So you take none.

03:42:22.583 --> 03:42:31.003
LAURA: I use Hellish Rebuke, and I go: That hurt!
In Infernal. Oh god.

03:42:31.003 --> 03:42:32.639
MATT: So you cast Hellish Rebuke.

03:42:32.639 --> 03:42:33.813
LAURA: Yes.

03:42:33.813 --> 03:42:43.249
MATT: Nothing comes out. The ice gathers around
you and then rockets behind you. No effect.

03:42:43.249 --> 03:42:46.944
LAURA: (gasps) I turn.

03:42:46.944 --> 03:42:53.259
MATT: You turn around and look at the crystal, and
the crystal is now glowing. The light that

03:42:53.259 --> 03:42:59.991
emanates from the blue-green crystal travels down
and arcs through the hallway, hits the center, and

03:42:59.991 --> 03:43:05.818
gives a faint line towards this object across the
way. Twiggy and Beau, you guys can see, as it hits

03:43:05.818 --> 03:43:10.681
the center, this very faint trickle of energy is
now hitting this far pillar where the darkened

03:43:10.681 --> 03:43:13.123
sphere is standing.

03:43:13.123 --> 03:43:15.057
MARISHA: Twiggy.

03:43:15.057 --> 03:43:17.178
LAURA: That was cold damage!

03:43:17.178 --> 03:43:19.587
MARISHA: It was cold? That was awesome.

03:43:19.587 --> 03:43:21.433
DEBORAH: Fire on the other one? I don't know.

03:43:21.433 --> 03:43:24.065
MATT: That finishes-- well, the dragon's going to
try and fly up again.

03:43:24.065 --> 03:43:25.796
MARISHA: Fire and ice.

03:43:25.796 --> 03:43:29.450
LAURA: Oh, well, that's good. You get an attack,
and the fire gets an attack.

03:43:29.450 --> 03:43:31.014
MATT: Both of you do. You and the fire elemental
do.

03:43:31.014 --> 03:43:34.316
MARISHA: Yeah, we got it in range. I'm sorry I
killed him.

03:43:34.316 --> 03:43:38.811
LAURA: No, I'm sorry I just made a weasel and not
a fucking cow or something.

03:43:38.811 --> 03:43:41.875
MARISHA: So I get an attack, and Sentinel.

03:43:41.875 --> 03:43:43.184
MATT: I know.

03:43:43.184 --> 03:43:45.538
MARISHA: No!

03:43:45.538 --> 03:43:46.941
MATT: What'd you roll?

03:43:46.941 --> 03:43:47.750
MARISHA: A four.

03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:50.897
MATT: A four. Yeah, so it gets out of your reach.
Miss. The fire elemental does get another attack

03:43:50.897 --> 03:43:52.826
as well.

03:43:52.826 --> 03:43:56.010
MARISHA: Natural 20.

03:43:56.368 --> 03:44:00.123
MATT: Roll critical damage for the fire elemental.
The dragon, however, does still manage to get out

03:44:00.123 --> 03:44:02.622
of melee range and get itself up in the air.

03:44:02.622 --> 03:44:05.379
MARISHA: Five, ten, plus another 13 damage.

03:44:05.379 --> 03:44:07.073
MATT: 13 damage? Okay.

03:44:07.073 --> 03:44:09.905
MARISHA: Right? It's dice times two.

03:44:09.905 --> 03:44:24.064
MATT: Correct. With the rest of its ten feet up
it's going (counting). The dragon is now currently

03:44:24.064 --> 03:44:26.310
hovering over--

03:44:26.310 --> 03:44:27.923
MARISHA: It's going after Jester?

03:44:27.923 --> 03:44:35.118
MATT: Yeah, we'll say it's there. The dragon,
seeing the glyphs light up, is now turning--

03:44:35.118 --> 03:44:36.683
MARISHA: Is it its turn?

03:44:36.683 --> 03:44:39.116
MATT: Yeah, it just finished its turn blasting and
uses its movement to move up.

03:44:39.116 --> 03:44:40.515
MARISHA: It takes fire damage, too.

03:44:40.515 --> 03:44:41.932
MATT: That's true. You get another ten fire
damage.

03:44:41.932 --> 03:44:43.450
MARISHA: Another six.

03:44:43.450 --> 03:44:50.844
MATT: Got it. That finishes that round. Next
round, top of it, we have-- no, because you guys

03:44:50.844 --> 03:44:52.687
came in last round.

03:44:52.687 --> 03:44:54.313
TRAVIS: Nott and Caleb.

03:44:54.313 --> 03:44:58.106
MATT: Nott and Caleb, you guys have a few more
rounds. You dilly-dallied back there.

03:44:58.106 --> 03:45:00.481
SAM: We could stay here, Caleb.

03:45:00.481 --> 03:45:02.574
MATT: You guys are looking through books right
now.

03:45:02.574 --> 03:45:06.191
MARISHA: Oh wait, no, it's the elemental's turn,
right? The elemental goes after the dragon?

03:45:06.191 --> 03:45:09.818
MATT: The elemental went after Twiggy. It already
went. It held its action, remember?

03:45:09.818 --> 03:45:10.697
MARISHA: That's right.

03:45:10.697 --> 03:45:13.075
MATT: Caduceus. You're up.

03:45:13.075 --> 03:45:15.437
TALIESIN: Okay, I saw a bit of this go down.

03:45:15.437 --> 03:45:17.015
MATT: Correct. You are no longer invisible.

03:45:17.015 --> 03:45:18.368
TALIESIN: Nope, I'm back.

03:45:18.368 --> 03:45:22.692
MATT: You saw none of this. You were over here in
this chamber. All you saw was a blue thing go

03:45:22.692 --> 03:45:25.822
(buzzing). That's all you know.

03:45:25.822 --> 03:45:27.936
TALIESIN: Lightning--

03:45:27.936 --> 03:45:33.114
MATT: You saw lightning go down there. You heard a
scream. You saw a blue glow (buzzing) up the--

03:45:33.114 --> 03:45:38.693
TRAVIS: I'm down here now going (screaming).

03:45:38.693 --> 03:45:46.886
TALIESIN: I was basically going to try this
before, anyway. I'm going to start heading, so I

03:45:46.886 --> 03:45:58.371
can get a better view, towards the edge of there.
Yeah, just so I can hold if I need to. Yeah,

03:45:58.371 --> 03:46:18.527
there's no Caleb. I'm going to yell: Duck! And I'm
going to ready a shot of Sacred Flame. Actually,

03:46:18.527 --> 03:46:22.504
Sacred Flame's not a bolt; it's an appearance. I'm
going to hit Sacred Flame on the crystal.

03:46:22.504 --> 03:46:24.699
MATT: Which one?

03:46:24.699 --> 03:46:29.369
TALIESIN: On the one behind us. The one at the end
of the-- behind Fjord.

03:46:29.369 --> 03:46:35.914
MATT: Okay. You release Sacred Flame. The flame
burns up around it, dissipates. No effect.

03:46:35.914 --> 03:46:38.311
TALIESIN: Hmm, weird. All right. That's my turn.

03:46:38.311 --> 03:46:40.677
MATT: Okay. Brings us to Fjord.

03:46:40.677 --> 03:46:42.526
TRAVIS: It burned up around it and didn't do
anything?

03:46:42.526 --> 03:46:43.630
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:46:43.630 --> 03:46:45.623
LIAM: What kind of damage?

03:46:47.869 --> 03:46:52.245
TRAVIS: God, what do I do? Cast Armor of Agathys
on myself and smash my head into the crystal?

03:46:52.866 --> 03:46:55.991
MATT: I mean, if you want to try it.

03:46:55.991 --> 03:46:59.794
TRAVIS: It's cold damage.

03:46:59.794 --> 03:47:04.414
MARISHA: Yeah. Do the football body slam.

03:47:04.414 --> 03:47:08.034
LAURA: Even casting the spell in its vicinity. Try
casting it.

03:47:08.034 --> 03:47:12.238
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on
myself at 4th level.

03:47:12.238 --> 03:47:17.307
(laughter)

03:47:17.307 --> 03:47:23.496
MATT: Okay. All the moisture in the air gets
pulled in and clings itself to the outside of

03:47:23.496 --> 03:47:30.137
Fjord as this icy, encased chunk of arcane armor
that gives off this mist around his torso.

03:47:30.137 --> 03:47:34.513
TRAVIS: (laughing) I smash my head into the
crystal.

03:47:34.513 --> 03:47:36.196
LIAM: Wait, is there any armor on your head?

03:47:36.196 --> 03:47:45.369
MATT: Yeah, sure! It creates this banded partial
helmet, and you crack into the crystal. The armor

03:47:45.369 --> 03:47:53.991
shatters off of you, and into the crystal. The
crystal glows. You're a bit dazed by it, but the

03:47:53.991 --> 03:48:01.125
light tears down to the center of the chamber. The
light actually brightens in the center, and there

03:48:01.125 --> 03:48:06.313
the central orb that's there that's been dark
suddenly lights up with the same dull blue-green

03:48:06.313 --> 03:48:10.514
glow as the coloration on the floor and the
coloration that you noticed very faintly coming

03:48:10.514 --> 03:48:13.071
from the inside of the orb when you initially were
inspecting it.

03:48:13.071 --> 03:48:19.518
TRAVIS: Can I use my movement now to run up
towards the tunnel where Caduceus is in the

03:48:19.518 --> 03:48:25.822
direction that the light moved? If I roll less
than an 11 on Blink, does the spell end or is it

03:48:25.822 --> 03:48:26.924
every turn?

03:48:26.924 --> 03:48:28.000
MATT: Every turn you have to keep doing it.

03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:28.755
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

03:48:28.755 --> 03:48:30.507
MATT: You can end the spell prematurely if you
want to.

03:48:30.507 --> 03:48:33.625
TRAVIS: Well, apparently I am fucking terrified. I
shit my pants and I can't Blink.

03:48:33.625 --> 03:48:38.436
MATT: God! Why won't it happen? Okay, that ends
Fjord's go. Beau, you're up.

03:48:38.436 --> 03:48:47.700
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to run over here to the
altar-casket situation and I'm going to quickly

03:48:47.700 --> 03:48:50.438
check it out. What do I do?

03:48:50.438 --> 03:48:54.568
MATT: Okay, so you walk up there, you look down.
It's just a large pillar with intricate carvings

03:48:54.568 --> 03:48:58.872
and you see runes along the side that are
darkened. There is a sphere about that big that

03:48:58.872 --> 03:49:05.074
looks similar in size to the one the got you here,
but it's not as intricate. It's more of a metal

03:49:05.074 --> 03:49:11.008
ball that has hollow runes carved in it that the
glowing blue-green light is emanating from. It's

03:49:11.008 --> 03:49:15.350
lighting it from underneath the faint glow and
it's lightning the middle of this small alcove.

03:49:15.350 --> 03:49:17.377
MARISHA: Do I still have an action?

03:49:17.377 --> 03:49:20.062
MATT: Yeah, that was just your movement.

03:49:20.062 --> 03:49:32.439
MARISHA: Can I try and replicate on this sphere
the movements I watched Twiggy do to get us here?

03:49:32.439 --> 03:49:35.430
MATT: Sure. You reach out and touch the sphere
(whooshing), Beau's gone.

03:49:35.430 --> 03:49:37.079
MARISHA: No! Fucking--

03:49:37.079 --> 03:49:40.941
SAM: Bye!

03:49:40.941 --> 03:49:42.682
MARISHA: Hope it's home.

03:49:42.682 --> 03:49:45.209
TRAVIS: "Hope it's home."

03:49:45.209 --> 03:49:51.218
MATT: That's your turn. Twiggy, you're up.

03:49:51.218 --> 03:49:54.678
DEBORAH: Oh boy!

03:49:54.678 --> 03:50:03.204
MATT: The fire elemental, right now, is no longer
under Beau's control. The thread has been severed

03:50:03.204 --> 03:50:06.501
that was keeping it controlled as an elemental.

03:50:06.501 --> 03:50:16.370
MARISHA: There's that whole thing about them which
I kind of knew going into this. Sorry. Bye!

03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:23.938
DEBORAH: Shit.

03:50:24.497 --> 03:50:26.611
SAM: Yasha's just like looking around the boat.

03:50:26.611 --> 03:50:28.631
MATT: Yep, for the next hour, the elemental is
considered an enemy.

03:50:28.631 --> 03:50:30.965
SAM: Oh god.

03:50:30.965 --> 03:50:35.637
MATT: What are you doing, Twiggy? There's Jester
currently now pinned in the back of this hallway

03:50:35.637 --> 03:50:38.944
by a dragon flying in the air. It's about ten feet
above it.

03:50:38.944 --> 03:50:40.947
DEBORAH: Am I adjacent to the fire elemental?

03:50:40.947 --> 03:50:41.834
MATT: You are.

03:50:41.834 --> 03:50:43.003
DEBORAH: I am. Okay.

03:50:43.003 --> 03:50:46.065
MATT: You are now within its melee range because
you are now considered an enemy. It was originally

03:50:46.065 --> 03:50:51.252
whirling there and then all the sudden as Beau
disappears it (growling).

03:50:51.252 --> 03:50:58.877
DEBORAH: Okay, I'm going to take out a stick of
gum, I'm going to open it, I'm going to chew it a

03:50:58.877 --> 03:51:01.764
little bit, and I'm going to take it out and then
I am going to pluck one of my eyelashes and put it

03:51:01.764 --> 03:51:06.115
inside the gum, and I'm going to keep chewing it
and then I'm going to blow a bubble and the bubble

03:51:06.115 --> 03:51:09.388
is going to get bigger and bigger until it's
bigger than me. When it pops, it covers my whole

03:51:09.388 --> 03:51:14.186
body and I disappear. So I go invisible.

03:51:14.186 --> 03:51:18.507
MATT: That is my favorite descriptor of
Invisibility I think I've ever heard in the

03:51:18.507 --> 03:51:20.077
history of my gaming experience.

03:51:20.077 --> 03:51:22.872
DEBORAH: It says "an eyelash encased in gum
arabic."

03:51:22.872 --> 03:51:24.940
MATT: That makes me so happy.

03:51:24.940 --> 03:51:27.441
DEBORAH: All right, so I go invisible. That's my
action.

03:51:27.441 --> 03:51:29.810
MATT: You do.

03:51:29.810 --> 03:51:36.497
DEBORAH: Do I need to use my bonus action to
disengage or can I not?

03:51:36.497 --> 03:51:39.786
MATT: It still knows you're there. It will have
disadvantage on an attack as you move from melee.

03:51:39.786 --> 03:51:40.620
DEBORAH: Right.

03:51:40.620 --> 03:51:42.264
MATT: Or you could just use bonus action to
disengage.

03:51:42.264 --> 03:51:43.552
DEBORAH: Or I could use my-- okay.

03:51:43.552 --> 03:51:46.510
MATT: Or just assume that it might miss, up to
you.

03:51:46.510 --> 03:51:48.199
DEBORAH: Assume it might miss.

03:51:48.199 --> 03:51:49.702
TRAVIS: Yeah, assume 55 points'll miss.

03:51:49.702 --> 03:51:52.002
DEBORAH: I'm going to disengage from it.

03:51:52.002 --> 03:51:52.888
MATT: Okay.

03:51:52.888 --> 03:51:55.369
TALIESIN: Fudge.

03:51:55.369 --> 03:52:16.067
DEBORAH: 25 feet. (counting) Shit. Sorry, guys.

03:52:16.067 --> 03:52:18.017
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

03:52:18.017 --> 03:52:20.667
TRAVIS: It's just a dragon and a fire elemental.
Yeah, take your time.

03:52:20.667 --> 03:52:31.939
DEBORAH: What am I going to do? Okay, I'm going
to-- I can use it-- oh, I already used my bonus

03:52:31.939 --> 03:52:37.992
action. Damn it, that's why I didn't want to do
it. All right, I run to the pedestal, but I don't

03:52:37.992 --> 03:52:40.006
touch the thing.

03:52:40.006 --> 03:52:43.122
MATT: Okay. 25. You're right there.

03:52:43.122 --> 03:52:44.816
DEBORAH: Yeah, I'm right there. Okay.

03:52:44.816 --> 03:52:51.469
MATT: Okay, that ends your go. That brings us to
the fire elemental's turn. The fire elemental does

03:52:51.469 --> 03:52:58.747
not know where you are. It's going to move to the
closest target. It's actually going to, as part of

03:52:58.747 --> 03:53:00.123
its fire form--

03:53:00.123 --> 03:53:02.574
TALIESIN: Is the dragon the closest to it? I
mean--

03:53:02.574 --> 03:53:07.251
DEBORAH: It would attack anything, right?

03:53:07.251 --> 03:53:16.437
MATT: The fire elemental is going to move through
both of you. As it bursts through, you both burst

03:53:16.437 --> 03:53:18.767
into flames. So both of you are on fire.

03:53:18.767 --> 03:53:24.564
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. It's half-dead.

03:53:24.873 --> 03:53:29.196
MATT: It is. It is going to attempt to attack each
of you once, since you're both within his

03:53:29.196 --> 03:53:34.064
attacking. Fjord, that is a 17 to hit?

03:53:34.064 --> 03:53:35.600
TRAVIS: That is my armor class.

03:53:35.600 --> 03:53:42.749
MATT: All right. You take 11 points of fire
damage.

03:53:42.749 --> 03:53:47.366
TRAVIS: Okay. That's reduced by-- Oh. How much--

03:53:47.366 --> 03:53:50.183
MATT: The armor's gone. It was consumed by the
crystal.

03:53:50.183 --> 03:53:51.691
TRAVIS: That makes it simple.

03:53:51.691 --> 03:53:55.367
MATT: That is going to be a 19 to hit you,
Caduceus?

03:53:55.367 --> 03:53:58.192
TALIESIN: 19? Goddamn it. Yeah, that hits.

03:53:58.192 --> 03:54:08.451
MATT: You take seven points-- sorry, ten points of
fire damage. That's going to end its turn. Jester,

03:54:08.451 --> 03:54:09.377
your turn.

03:54:09.377 --> 03:54:10.386
LAURA: It's my turn?

03:54:10.386 --> 03:54:11.386
TALIESIN: Ten points? 11 points?

03:54:11.386 --> 03:54:11.970
MATT: Ten points.

03:54:11.970 --> 03:54:13.002
TALIESIN: Ten points, and I'm on fire.

03:54:13.002 --> 03:54:15.904
MATT: Yes. Which means at the top of your turns,
you take 1d10 fire damage, unless you use an

03:54:15.904 --> 03:54:17.820
action to put it out.

03:54:17.820 --> 03:54:19.276
LAURA: Okay, well--

03:54:19.276 --> 03:54:19.790
MARISHA: Sorry.

03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:23.064
LAURA: Taking a cue from Fjord, I'm going to cast
Blink on myself.

03:54:23.064 --> 03:54:24.056
SAM: Hey!

03:54:24.056 --> 03:54:24.991
MATT: Okay.

03:54:24.991 --> 03:54:26.138
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:54:26.138 --> 03:54:31.633
LAURA: Then if I try to run underneath the
dragon--

03:54:31.633 --> 03:54:32.631
MATT: Make a concentration check for me.

03:54:32.631 --> 03:54:34.747
LAURA: -- he's going to get an attack of
opportunity on me?

03:54:34.747 --> 03:54:36.310
MATT: It's above you, it won't get an attack of
opportunity on you.

03:54:36.310 --> 03:54:38.245
LAURA: No? Okay, then I'm just going to dash
underneath it.

03:54:38.245 --> 03:54:39.632
MATT: So you're not going to cast the spell?

03:54:39.632 --> 03:54:41.518
LAURA: No, by dash, I mean run. Sorry.

03:54:41.518 --> 03:54:45.138
MATT: (counting) 30. You get there. Roll a d20.

03:54:45.138 --> 03:54:46.203
TALIESIN: Is it a straight d20?

03:54:46.203 --> 03:54:47.313
MATT: It's your constitution saving throw.

03:54:47.313 --> 03:54:49.194
TALIESIN: Oh, 19.

03:54:49.194 --> 03:54:49.969
MATT: You're fine.

03:54:49.969 --> 03:54:52.192
LAURA: No. I rolled a three.

03:54:52.192 --> 03:54:56.607
MATT: You're still there. You get there and the
magic just sputters for a second. Not going to

03:54:56.607 --> 03:54:57.630
save you, unfortunately.

03:54:57.630 --> 03:55:00.941
LAURA: Okay, then for my bonus action-- I get a
bonus action?

03:55:00.941 --> 03:55:01.939
MATT: Yeah.

03:55:01.939 --> 03:55:07.882
LAURA: Yeah-- Oh I can't. Oh! I'm going to use--
Nope. I've already used a spell. Fucking balls!

03:55:07.882 --> 03:55:11.748
I'm going to do nothing. I'm going to tremble.

03:55:11.748 --> 03:55:15.130
MATT: Aww. All right, end of Jester's turn. The
dragon's turn.

03:55:15.130 --> 03:55:16.381
TALIESIN: On fire.

03:55:16.381 --> 03:55:22.846
MATT: Yes, it takes d10 damage. I'm going to roll
that. That's a nine. All right.

03:55:22.846 --> 03:55:24.437
TRAVIS: Is it looking rough? Real rough?

03:55:24.437 --> 03:55:25.050
MATT: No.

03:55:25.050 --> 03:55:26.691
LAURA: He's bloodied. He's definitely bloodied.

03:55:26.691 --> 03:55:28.950
TRAVIS: Pieces of his ribs showing through?

03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:33.810
MATT: He's getting close to-- You're starting to
see some wear and tear.

03:55:33.810 --> 03:55:38.382
LAURA: Okay. A single scale is chipped away.

03:55:38.382 --> 03:55:39.880
LIAM: 68% guys.

03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:42.571
MATT: Does not get his dragon's breath back.

03:55:42.571 --> 03:55:43.944
TALIESIN: Thank god.

03:55:43.944 --> 03:55:49.199
MATT: So instead, it's going to swoop down towards
Jester, trying to prevent you from escaping.

03:55:49.199 --> 03:55:51.248
TRAVIS: But look how cute she is.

03:55:51.248 --> 03:55:55.761
MATT: So it makes three attacks. One with its
bite, two with its claws. First attack at Jester.

03:55:55.761 --> 03:55:58.244
Okay, that's a 14 to hit.

03:55:58.244 --> 03:55:59.820
LAURA: Misses! It misses.

03:55:59.820 --> 03:56:01.205
TALIESIN: Minus a d4.

03:56:01.205 --> 03:56:01.842
MATT: Right.

03:56:01.842 --> 03:56:03.126
TALIESIN: Just in general.

03:56:03.126 --> 03:56:07.552
MATT: Yeah. As it strikes with its claw, you pull
your shield up, sparks fly off as its claw arcs

03:56:07.552 --> 03:56:15.465
across the outside of your shield. It strikes with
its other claw. Ooh, that's a natural 19 plus--

03:56:15.465 --> 03:56:17.691
that's 28, minus one, 27.

03:56:17.691 --> 03:56:20.555
SAM and LAURA: That hits.

03:56:20.555 --> 03:56:23.945
MATT: I'm pretty sure that's it. Yeah, so the claw
strike manages. As the shield pulls away from the

03:56:23.945 --> 03:56:27.216
first hit, you're not able to get back quick
enough and the second claw goes right across your

03:56:27.216 --> 03:56:30.816
torso for 15 points of slashing damage.

03:56:30.816 --> 03:56:32.063
LAURA: Cool.

03:56:32.063 --> 03:56:39.880
MATT: The bite is going to come after you. That is
going to be a 19 to hit? Minus a d4. Minus four.

03:56:39.880 --> 03:56:41.375
It's going to be a 15 to hit.

03:56:41.375 --> 03:56:43.945
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah! Bane!

03:56:43.945 --> 03:56:49.579
MATT: As it goes to bite towards you, its jaws
open, you pull back and you instinctively put the

03:56:49.579 --> 03:56:53.888
shield up to block it and its mouth comes down on
the shield, holding on to it. Caduceus in the back

03:56:53.888 --> 03:57:01.453
focuses for a second and you watch the jaw weaken
and pull back. Readying itself for another strike.

03:57:01.983 --> 03:57:06.736
That ends its turn. That brings us to the top of
the round. Caduceus, you're up.

03:57:06.736 --> 03:57:09.367
You guys are looking at books still. I'm
sorry.

03:57:09.367 --> 03:57:10.365
LIAM: It's cool.

03:57:10.365 --> 03:57:12.388
SAM: I think I can unlock this one!

03:57:14.123 --> 03:57:16.048
MARISHA: Meanwhile...

03:57:16.048 --> 03:57:17.558
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm on fire.

03:57:17.558 --> 03:57:19.450
MATT: You do. You take--

03:57:19.450 --> 03:57:20.682
TALIESIN: Can I do anything about that?

03:57:20.682 --> 03:57:23.068
MATT: You can spend an action to do so. You take
six points of fire damage.

03:57:23.068 --> 03:57:35.237
TALIESIN: That's okay. Six points of fire damage
is fine. I'm going to book it towards that fucking

03:57:35.237 --> 03:57:45.989
altar. That's 30. I can spend an action to go.

03:57:45.989 --> 03:57:47.289
MATT: To get there, yes.

03:57:47.289 --> 03:57:50.743
TALIESIN: But people are still fucking down,
aren't they?

03:57:50.743 --> 03:57:55.677
MATT: Well, people are in a couple of rough
places, and you're still missing Caleb and Nott.

03:57:55.677 --> 03:57:58.562
Up to you. You still have an action to use.

03:57:58.562 --> 03:58:07.864
TALIESIN: Fudge. I'm going to do something dumb.
Don't leave a man behind.

03:58:07.864 --> 03:58:09.442
MATT: I like dumb.

03:58:09.442 --> 03:58:15.305
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- this is going to get
weird. Halfway through my run, actually right

03:58:15.305 --> 03:58:19.500
before I start my run, I'm going to cast Meld into
Stone.

03:58:19.500 --> 03:58:23.472
LAURA and LIAM: Meld into Stone.

03:58:23.472 --> 03:58:24.260
TRAVIS: You're going to what?

03:58:24.260 --> 03:58:26.246
LIAM: He's going to Blues Traveler it.

03:58:26.246 --> 03:58:31.604
MATT: All right. It's not concentration.

03:58:31.604 --> 03:58:39.568
TALIESIN: It's not concentration. Casting Meld
into Stone so that when I end my turn, in theory,

03:58:39.568 --> 03:58:42.595
I will not be on fire any more because I'll be
inside of the stone.

03:58:42.595 --> 03:58:43.847
MATT: I'll allow that.

03:58:43.847 --> 03:58:44.617
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:58:44.617 --> 03:58:48.417
MATT: The flame goes out because there's no air
for it to breathe. Do you step into it here?

03:58:48.417 --> 03:58:50.628
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm actually just going to walk--

03:58:50.628 --> 03:58:53.875
MATT: He Homer Simpsons into the stone wall.

03:58:53.875 --> 03:58:58.743
TALIESIN: I go and I'm going to take my 30 feet
straight towards the wall. I can't see anything,

03:58:58.743 --> 03:59:01.677
but I can move.

03:59:02.373 --> 03:59:07.413
MATT: You can use your movement to leave the stone
where you entered it, which ends the spell. You

03:59:07.413 --> 03:59:09.070
don't get to move through the stone.

03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:11.236
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk all the way.

03:59:11.236 --> 03:59:14.815
MATT: It's a lie-and-wait type of spell. Like
merge into it and stay there for up to eight

03:59:14.815 --> 03:59:20.136
hours, and then once you leave it. But the fire's
out and you have your movement.

03:59:20.136 --> 03:59:25.071
TALIESIN: I would know how the spell-- I'm going
to get as much movement as I can and then hold for

03:59:25.071 --> 03:59:27.113
the turn.

03:59:27.113 --> 03:59:33.095
MATT: 25, 30. You're in the stone, currently in
the wall. Got it. That ends your turn, Caduceus.

03:59:33.095 --> 03:59:34.883
Fjord, you're up.

03:59:34.883 --> 03:59:40.440
SAM: Twiggy's invisible. Beau's gone. Caduceus is
stone. This is going great.

03:59:40.440 --> 03:59:42.078
MATT: This is going great, guys.

03:59:42.078 --> 03:59:43.794
TRAVIS: I take 1d10 fire damage, right?

03:59:43.794 --> 03:59:47.600
MATT: Yep, you do. You take three points of fire
damage.

03:59:47.600 --> 03:59:55.136
TRAVIS: Okay. I will use my movement to-- where
the fuck am I? To run towards the pedestal.

03:59:55.136 --> 04:00:01.297
Actually, I'm sorry. Let's come this way, to
Jester.

04:00:01.297 --> 04:00:05.190
MATT: Okay, so (counting) 25.

04:00:05.190 --> 04:00:11.386
TRAVIS: (repeatedly) Uh-huh.

04:00:11.386 --> 04:00:13.451
MATT: What're you doing?

04:00:18.494 --> 04:00:23.203
TRAVIS: Let me take back half that movement and
I'll go here.

04:00:23.203 --> 04:00:25.499
MATT: Okay.

04:00:25.938 --> 04:00:35.088
TRAVIS: I'm going to-- I can't bail on Jester. I'm
going to fire two Eldritch Blasts at the dragon,

04:00:35.088 --> 04:00:36.498
trying to get its attention.

04:00:36.498 --> 04:00:38.255
MATT: Roll two attacks.

04:00:38.255 --> 04:00:41.634
TRAVIS: 25 and a 22.

04:00:41.634 --> 04:00:44.251
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage.

04:00:48.034 --> 04:00:54.430
TRAVIS: Seven points of Eldritch Blast. Ten. So 17
total.

04:00:54.430 --> 04:01:04.113
MATT: Nice. It gets hit twice. I'll say, go ahead
and make an intimidation check. Just as part of

04:01:04.113 --> 04:01:06.304
this attack, since this was your intent.

04:01:06.304 --> 04:01:07.611
TRAVIS: 21.

04:01:07.611 --> 04:01:13.377
MATT: You have the dragon's attention. He was
slashing into Jester, and after that, twice in the

04:01:13.377 --> 04:01:16.978
side of the head, it (growling) back towards you.

04:01:16.978 --> 04:01:20.873
TRAVIS: Do I have to roll blink if I don't--

04:01:20.873 --> 04:01:22.441
MATT: You can choose to end the spell.

04:01:22.441 --> 04:01:24.557
TRAVIS: But I think, doesn't it take an action or
I can just choose?

04:01:24.557 --> 04:01:29.047
MATT: That's a good question. Let's go ahead and
check. It should tell you on the spell.

04:01:29.047 --> 04:01:33.399
TRAVIS: It says, "you can dismiss this spell as an
action."

04:01:33.399 --> 04:01:35.102
MATT: Ah. So no.

04:01:35.102 --> 04:01:37.314
LAURA: No, you have to roll for it.

04:01:38.314 --> 04:01:39.686
TRAVIS: Bye!

04:01:39.686 --> 04:01:41.779
(groaning)

04:01:41.779 --> 04:01:44.309
TRAVIS: The one fucking time I didn't want to.

04:01:44.309 --> 04:01:47.824
TALIESIN: We are making some interesting calls
tonight. It's exciting.

04:01:47.824 --> 04:01:52.739
MATT: That ends Fjord's go. Beau, you're out.
Twiggy, you're up.

04:01:52.739 --> 04:01:55.048
DEBORAH: Okay. I'm invisible, so I have
advantage?

04:01:55.048 --> 04:01:57.026
MATT: For an attack you do, yes.

04:01:57.026 --> 04:02:00.407
DEBORAH: For an attack? Okay, so I realize it'll
end my invisibility to do this, but I pop back out

04:02:00.407 --> 04:02:04.670
of my invisibility and I'm going to snipe one at
him with advantage.

04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:07.410
MATT: Okay, go for it. Is this with your bow?

04:02:07.410 --> 04:02:08.538
DEBORAH: My shortbow.

04:02:08.538 --> 04:02:09.242
TALIESIN: You got a shortbow?

04:02:09.242 --> 04:02:13.395
DEBORAH: I got a shortbow. 18 plus seven.

04:02:13.395 --> 04:02:15.232
MATT: That definitely hits, and it is sneak attack
because he doesn't see you.

04:02:15.232 --> 04:02:16.920
DEBORAH: So great.

04:02:16.920 --> 04:02:20.367
MATT: You appear in that space and you let loose
an arrow that sinks itself right into the heart

04:02:20.367 --> 04:02:22.873
and scaled underhide of the blue dragon.

04:02:22.873 --> 04:02:31.874
DEBORAH: I say: You're mean! That's ten on my
initial hit, and then my sneak, seven and ten. So

04:02:31.874 --> 04:02:35.543
17 additionally to the ten. So 27 points of
damage.

04:02:35.543 --> 04:02:46.384
MATT: 27 points of damage. It's looking hurt. You
can see blood emitting from some of its wounds.

04:02:46.384 --> 04:02:50.138
DEBORAH: As a bonus action, I'm going to attempt
to hide behind the pedestal.

04:02:50.138 --> 04:02:50.955
MATT: Okay, so you move behind the pedestal?

04:02:50.955 --> 04:02:53.174
DEBORAH: Yeah. 15.

04:02:53.174 --> 04:02:55.527
MATT: You believe that you are hidden.

04:02:55.527 --> 04:02:57.504
DEBORAH: I believe I'm hidden, you guys.

04:02:57.504 --> 04:03:10.829
MATT: Fire elemental's turn. It goes this way. I'm
going to go ahead and-- Jester. Roll a d6. On a

04:03:10.829 --> 04:03:15.551
one, two, three, it attacks you. On a four, five,
six, it attacks the dragon.

04:03:15.551 --> 04:03:16.551
LAURA: Four!

04:03:16.551 --> 04:03:19.283
MARISHA: Eyy! Fuck up that dragon!

04:03:19.283 --> 04:03:24.414
MATT: It comes over to this side. It moves into
this tiny space, because it can. It's going to run

04:03:24.414 --> 04:03:31.587
past. It is going to ignite you both as it runs
through. So you are on fire. The dragon's still on

04:03:31.587 --> 04:03:38.477
fire. But it doesn't lay into you with two
attacks. It attacks the dragon twice. That is a

04:03:38.477 --> 04:03:51.048
natural 20 and a five. Miss. 12, plus three. 15
points of damage on that crit. Nice! Not bad. All

04:03:51.048 --> 04:03:53.948
right, that ends the fire elemental's turn.
Jester, your turn. First, at the top of your turn

04:03:53.948 --> 04:03:57.662
you take six points of fire damage.

04:03:57.662 --> 04:03:59.697
LAURA: Okay.

04:03:59.697 --> 04:04:01.993
MATT: You're burning. What are you doing?

04:04:01.993 --> 04:04:10.188
LAURA: I guess I'm going to-- this is so lame.
It's so stupid because Cure Wounds isn't going to

04:04:10.188 --> 04:04:13.891
do enough to fix me to where if he hits me, I'm
still going to go down!

04:04:13.891 --> 04:04:15.132
SAM: Do a higher level?

04:04:15.132 --> 04:04:16.491
LAURA: That is at the highest level!

04:04:16.491 --> 04:04:20.250
SAM: It's all you could do.

04:04:20.250 --> 04:04:21.550
LAURA: I know.

04:04:21.550 --> 04:04:24.751
MATT: What are you doing, Jester?

04:04:28.421 --> 04:04:34.024
LAURA: Fuck it. I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds
at 3rd-level.

04:04:34.124 --> 04:04:36.735
SAM: Going down fighting.

04:04:36.735 --> 04:04:38.468
MARISHA: Kill him!

04:04:38.468 --> 04:04:40.674
MATT: Roll your attack.

04:04:40.674 --> 04:04:44.053
MARISHA: Oh my god, why is he doing that?

04:04:44.053 --> 04:04:54.370
LAURA: It's just a touch-- oh, on a hit. Okay.
Natural fucking one. It's okay.

04:04:54.370 --> 04:05:00.135
MATT: You spin around. The flames are burning
around you. You spin to look at the dragon and the

04:05:00.135 --> 04:05:04.712
fear wells up inside you, facing it down. Even
with the flames burning around it, you can see its

04:05:04.712 --> 04:05:09.176
face coming through towards you, angry. Now that
Fjord's vanished and is no longer in its sight,

04:05:09.176 --> 04:05:14.007
it's turned its attention back to you. You think
you reach out for it and expend the spell, and

04:05:14.007 --> 04:05:16.729
you're just a few inches short.

04:05:16.729 --> 04:05:24.263
LAURA: I'm all alone. I'm going to try and blink,
then.

04:05:24.263 --> 04:05:26.497
MATT: Okay. So you're ending your turn there,
you're not going to move?

04:05:26.497 --> 04:05:28.359
LAURA: Well, if I move it's going to attack me.

04:05:28.359 --> 04:05:29.691
MATT: That's true.

04:05:29.691 --> 04:05:30.742
LAURA: So I'm hoping...

04:05:30.742 --> 04:05:31.451
TRAVIS: Come on.

04:05:31.451 --> 04:05:33.179
MARISHA: Blink!

04:05:33.179 --> 04:05:34.682
LAURA: 19!

04:05:34.682 --> 04:05:38.864
(cheering)

04:05:38.864 --> 04:05:42.233
TRAVIS: When you come back, remember it's ten feet
from where--

04:05:42.233 --> 04:05:43.733
LAURA: Ten feet from where I was.

04:05:43.733 --> 04:05:45.250
SAM: Are you invisible with Blink?

04:05:45.250 --> 04:05:46.711
LAURA: You're in another plane.

04:05:46.711 --> 04:05:48.243
SAM: Oh, thank Jesus.

04:05:48.243 --> 04:05:51.918
LIAM: Twiggy is the only visible person.

04:05:51.918 --> 04:05:55.222
DEBORAH: I'm hiding, kind of? Really well.

04:05:55.222 --> 04:06:05.415
MATT: The dragon's turn. Top of its turn, it does
get its breath back. It rolled a six. It comes

04:06:05.415 --> 04:06:10.843
through the hallway angrily.

04:06:10.843 --> 04:06:13.415
TALIESIN: Does it get an attack of opportunity?

04:06:13.415 --> 04:06:19.727
MATT: It does. So I'll roll the attack for the
elemental. Another natural 20! Holy shit. This is

04:06:19.727 --> 04:06:24.724
the luckiest damn elemental in the world. That's
12 plus three, another 15 points of damage.

04:06:24.724 --> 04:06:26.705
SAM: Whoa.

04:06:26.705 --> 04:06:33.937
MATT: The dragon also takes, because it's still on
fire, an additional six points of damage. It's

04:06:33.937 --> 04:06:35.626
looking hurt.

04:06:35.626 --> 04:06:37.811
TRAVIS: "It's looking hurt."

04:06:37.811 --> 04:06:45.732
MATT: I'm going to see if it rolls high enough
perception to see you. Natural 18. It comes in the

04:06:45.732 --> 04:06:55.609
chamber. (sniffing) (crackling blast) This beam of
vibrant blue, electrical energy arcs towards you.

04:06:55.609 --> 04:06:57.967
Make a dexterity saving throw.

04:06:57.967 --> 04:06:59.955
DEBORAH: Evasion, but we'll do it.

04:06:59.955 --> 04:07:01.617
TALIESIN: You also still have this, I think.

04:07:01.617 --> 04:07:02.802
DEBORAH: Pretty good.

04:07:02.802 --> 04:07:04.086
LAURA: Oh, that's right! You have the mote!

04:07:04.086 --> 04:07:05.282
TALIESIN: Just in case.

04:07:05.282 --> 04:07:06.267
DEBORAH: What is that?

04:07:06.267 --> 04:07:08.182
TALIESIN: That's another roll, if you need it.

04:07:08.182 --> 04:07:12.752
DEBORAH: Oh, I have another? I may not need it.
Just a dexterity saving throw, right?

04:07:12.752 --> 04:07:13.827
MATT: Correct.

04:07:13.827 --> 04:07:17.491
DEBORAH: Yeah, I mean that's a 23. Sorry, yes,
23.

04:07:17.491 --> 04:07:22.586
MATT: It just barely skims, singeing the edges of
the branches that are sticking out of your hair.

04:07:22.586 --> 04:07:28.462
The rat's nest themselves curling back from the
momentary heat as the flash of energy, but you

04:07:28.462 --> 04:07:33.957
avoid it entirely. Slams into the wall behind you.
Stone breaks and splinters and the energy

04:07:33.957 --> 04:07:39.679
dissipates throughout the area. No damage. Rogues
and evasion, man.

04:07:39.679 --> 04:07:41.889
LIAM: Five little lit candles.

04:07:41.889 --> 04:07:44.822
DEBORAH: Yep. Marshmallows toasting.

04:07:44.822 --> 04:07:50.528
MATT: It looks furious. (roaring) The breath
itself-- it smells like burnt ozone.

04:07:50.528 --> 04:07:53.351
DEBORAH: I actually still look like Halas because
it's not concentration.

04:07:53.351 --> 04:07:55.056
MATT: That's true, yeah.

04:07:55.056 --> 04:07:57.950
DEBORAH: It thinks I'm a four-foot tall Halas.

04:07:57.950 --> 04:07:59.416
LIAM: It went through the head.

04:07:59.416 --> 04:08:03.096
MATT: It's really confused by it. That ends its
turn. Top of the round.

04:08:03.096 --> 04:08:06.483
DEBORAH: Where are you?

04:08:06.483 --> 04:08:08.570
TALIESIN: We're hoping.

04:08:08.570 --> 04:08:10.409
MATT: Ah!

04:08:10.409 --> 04:08:12.600
SAM: Hey! We're going to land right on him!

04:08:12.600 --> 04:08:14.118
MARISHA: Kill him!

04:08:14.118 --> 04:08:16.511
MATT: Go ahead and make acrobatics checks, you
guys.

04:08:16.511 --> 04:08:19.481
MARISHA: Kill him. With your bodies.

04:08:19.481 --> 04:08:20.392
LIAM: Terrible.

04:08:20.392 --> 04:08:21.182
SAM: 12.

04:08:21.182 --> 04:08:21.753
LIAM: Five.

04:08:21.753 --> 04:08:24.729
SAM: Acrobatics check or save?

04:08:24.729 --> 04:08:25.977
MATT: Acrobatics check.

04:08:25.977 --> 04:08:27.248
SAM: Oh, it's a 12. No, I was right.

04:08:27.248 --> 04:08:34.897
MATT: You both fall prone right on the sides of it
as you slam into the dragon-- onto the side--

04:08:34.897 --> 04:08:37.008
(groaning)-- on the ground.

04:08:37.008 --> 04:08:38.506
SAM: Did we cause some damage to the dragon?

04:08:38.506 --> 04:08:44.522
MATT: Not for dragon scales, unfortunately, but
you do both take five points of bludgeoning damage

04:08:44.522 --> 04:08:45.888
from the impact.

04:08:45.888 --> 04:08:46.673
SAM: Great.

04:08:46.968 --> 04:08:51.686
MATT: You're like-- (groaning). Both roll
initiative to see where you fall on the initiative order.

04:08:51.686 --> 04:08:53.252
SAM: Mmm, eight.

04:08:53.252 --> 04:08:54.313
LIAM: Seven.

04:08:54.313 --> 04:08:55.803
MATT: Eight? Okay.

04:08:55.803 --> 04:08:57.601
SAM: Caleb! What's going on?

04:08:57.601 --> 04:09:00.130
LAURA: You don't see anybody in there.

04:09:00.130 --> 04:09:03.112
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, there's nobody in there!

04:09:03.112 --> 04:09:12.924
MATT: You're in a chamber. You land there and you
see this angry, burning dragon and this tiny

04:09:12.924 --> 04:09:18.678
little version of the mage that you walked through
the den of and that's it. You see the glowing

04:09:18.678 --> 04:09:25.086
sphere here on the pedestal, these lines of energy
that meet in the center. The fire elemental in the

04:09:25.086 --> 04:09:32.873
back way, burning. You're Troy in Community
walking in with the pizzas.

04:09:32.873 --> 04:09:37.371
LIAM: Minor question. Do I smell burnt ozone,
since you said that just a second ago?

04:09:37.371 --> 04:09:40.463
MATT: You do smell the electrical remainder in the
air.

04:09:40.463 --> 04:09:41.680
LIAM: Good enough.

04:09:41.680 --> 04:09:45.421
MARISHA: Who saw me bamf out by touching the
thing? Jes for sure did.

04:09:45.421 --> 04:09:46.483
DEBORAH: I saw it.

04:09:46.483 --> 04:09:48.349
MARISHA: And Fjord? Okay.

04:09:48.349 --> 04:09:50.028
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

04:09:50.028 --> 04:09:54.930
TALIESIN: Oh boy, I'm going to-- oh fuck, she's
not there, is she?

04:09:54.930 --> 04:09:56.953
DEBORAH: Do they need to roll into initiative?

04:09:56.953 --> 04:09:58.086
MATT: They already rolled initiative.

04:09:58.086 --> 04:09:59.891
DEBORAH: Oh, they already did. Okay, I didn't
catch it. You rolled badly? Oh no.

04:09:59.891 --> 04:10:03.617
TALIESIN: I'm going to come out of the wall.

04:10:03.617 --> 04:10:06.119
MATT: Okay.

04:10:06.119 --> 04:10:18.707
TALIESIN: I see them. Hmm? Yeah, no, and I'm going
to do the: We're running! It's bad! I'm going to--

04:10:19.245 --> 04:10:20.718
TRAVIS: It's bad!

04:10:20.718 --> 04:10:24.439
(laughter)

04:10:24.439 --> 04:10:31.367
TRAVIS: Oh my god, that's amazing! (flapping)
We're running, it's bad!

04:10:31.367 --> 04:10:37.759
(laughter)

04:10:37.759 --> 04:10:43.911
MATT: What are you doing Caduceus? You shout that
as you're stepping out of the wall. "We're

04:10:44.000 --> 04:10:46.375
"running, it's bad."

04:10:46.375 --> 04:10:48.609
SAM: Oh my god.

04:10:48.609 --> 04:10:50.562
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

04:10:50.562 --> 04:10:52.968
TALIESIN: I am going to--

04:10:52.968 --> 04:10:57.554
MATT: You're on deck, Fjord.

04:10:57.554 --> 04:11:01.865
TRAVIS: Walks out of the wall.

04:11:01.865 --> 04:11:05.522
MARISHA: They didn't run.

04:11:05.522 --> 04:11:11.205
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action since there's
no one to heal-- ah!

04:11:11.205 --> 04:11:12.341
DEBORAH and MARISHA: Ah!

04:11:12.341 --> 04:11:19.424
TALIESIN: Which is really frustrating, and there's
not a lot I can do. I am going to-- fuck, man,

04:11:19.424 --> 04:11:22.868
this is such a bad call.

04:11:22.868 --> 04:11:24.206
MATT: What are you doing?

04:11:24.206 --> 04:11:28.263
TALIESIN: I am going to cast-- so sorry, I'm doing
this weirdly--

04:11:28.263 --> 04:11:30.966
MATT: It's all good.

04:11:30.966 --> 04:11:38.632
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast-- where is it? Goddamn
it, where did it go? I'm going to cast Blindness

04:11:38.632 --> 04:11:41.626
on the dragon.

04:11:41.626 --> 04:11:42.637
LAURA: Yeah.

04:11:42.637 --> 04:11:45.335
MATT: All right. What's the saving throw on it?

04:11:45.335 --> 04:11:47.988
TALIESIN: It's a 16 constitution with a negative
d4.

04:11:47.988 --> 04:11:51.068
MATT: Okay. Is Blindness concentration?

04:11:51.068 --> 04:11:54.772
TALIESIN: Oh wait, I can't do that actually, never
mind. It's not, but I can't do it because I don't

04:11:54.772 --> 04:12:00.131
have any 3rd-level spells left. Oh, it's a
2nd-level! I'm a crazy person, yes. It's not a

04:12:00.131 --> 04:12:02.029
concentration spell.

04:12:02.029 --> 04:12:07.424
MATT: It would be a three plus four-- it's a plus
four con save, so it's a 17 minus four from the

04:12:07.424 --> 04:12:09.979
Bane, so it's 13. Yeah, it's blind.

04:12:09.979 --> 04:12:14.616
TRAVIS: Oh, you fucking crazy goth genius!

04:12:14.616 --> 04:12:18.774
TALIESIN: You are blind for a minute. I'm going to
take the rest of my movement and hop into the

04:12:18.774 --> 04:12:20.231
fucking orb.

04:12:20.231 --> 04:12:21.161
TRAVIS: Yes you do!

04:12:21.161 --> 04:12:26.198
MATT: You move up. The Bane fades.

04:12:26.198 --> 04:12:27.688
TALIESIN: The Bane does fade.

04:12:27.688 --> 04:12:29.134
MATT and TALIESIN: The Blindness stays.

04:12:29.134 --> 04:12:31.903
MATT: All right, that ends Caduceus' turn. Fjord,
you're up.

04:12:31.903 --> 04:12:40.216
TRAVIS: I pop back into existence ten feet. I want
to stay out of his melee.

04:12:40.216 --> 04:12:44.187
MATT: So there. All righty.

04:12:44.187 --> 04:12:47.150
SAM: Did Caleb and Nott see that? Do we make a check of
any kind?

04:12:47.150 --> 04:12:49.128
MARISHA: You had to have seen Caduceus.

04:12:49.398 --> 04:12:53.898
TALIESIN: I made sure you saw it. I was yelling at
you and making a fuss.

04:12:53.898 --> 04:12:59.789
MARISHA: He said, "We're running; it's bad," and
then jumped into a sphere. That's some children's

04:12:59.789 --> 04:13:02.639
cartoon-level obvious.

04:13:02.639 --> 04:13:07.167
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I'll use my extra language to
go: Yeah, it's bad. Grab the sphere! I'll use my

04:13:07.167 --> 04:13:15.043
full movement to run towards the sphere. If it
will put me in his melee-- will it?

04:13:15.043 --> 04:13:20.366
MATT: He has reach with his bite. He has that
entire hallway covered.

04:13:20.366 --> 04:13:26.491
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action Misty Step with
the sword to (poof) over to the globe.

04:13:26.491 --> 04:13:28.646
MARISHA: Yas, queen!

04:13:28.646 --> 04:13:31.422
MATT: That will put you at 30, right there.

04:13:31.422 --> 04:13:33.632
TRAVIS: I will reach out and touch someone.

04:13:33.632 --> 04:13:39.313
MATT: Fjord is out. At the top of your turn,
because you're still on fire, you do take four

04:13:39.313 --> 04:13:40.657
points of fire damage.

04:13:40.657 --> 04:13:41.736
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:13:41.736 --> 04:13:42.786
TALIESIN: Are you okay?

04:13:42.786 --> 04:13:44.364
LAURA: Mm-mm.

04:13:44.364 --> 04:13:47.858
SAM: No, she's not okay. She's been abandoned by
everyone who can help her.

04:13:47.858 --> 04:13:51.125
MATT: That's the end of Fjord's turn. It's your
turn.

04:13:51.125 --> 04:14:00.041
DEBORAH: I stand up again. I still look like
little Halas, but as Twiggy, I reach in my pouch

04:14:00.041 --> 04:14:06.246
again and pull out the tongue of a snake. As I do
that, I have in my palm a little bit of oil, and I

04:14:06.246 --> 04:14:12.784
run it back and forth on it. Then I throw it out
this way, and as I do that, I say: Wait until

04:14:12.784 --> 04:14:16.104
we've left. I try Suggestion.

04:14:16.104 --> 04:14:18.237
LIAM: Oh yes.

04:14:18.237 --> 04:14:22.387
DEBORAH: Wisdom saving throw. I'm sure it's very
wise.

04:14:22.387 --> 04:14:29.164
MATT: Wisdom saving throw. No, that's cocked. It's
a 19, unfortunately. Good try.

04:14:29.164 --> 04:14:32.157
DEBORAH: The little snake tongue falls on the
ground.

04:14:32.157 --> 04:14:38.483
MATT: (small impact) The dragon hears you speaking
and looks in your direction. But where the pale

04:14:38.483 --> 04:14:46.370
blue, piercing eyes were is just a cloud of black.
It is trying to sniff for where you might be.

04:14:46.370 --> 04:14:50.119
DEBORAH: For all intents and purposes, I'm already
hidden; I don't need to hide again, if it's

04:14:50.119 --> 04:14:51.617
already blind?

04:14:51.617 --> 04:14:52.850
MATT: In theory, yes.

04:14:52.850 --> 04:14:54.672
DEBORAH: In theory, yes, unless it's able to sense
me.

04:14:54.672 --> 04:14:55.871
MATT: Yes, it does not have tremorsense.

04:14:55.871 --> 04:14:59.822
DEBORAH: Okay! I still yell: Hey, guys--

04:14:59.822 --> 04:15:02.182
MATT: It does have blindsight to 30 feet, I just
noticed.

04:15:02.182 --> 04:15:15.647
DEBORAH: Oh! Then I do hide. I attempt to hide.
That's really good. That is a 25. But before I

04:15:15.647 --> 04:15:19.667
hide, I do yell: Touch the globe! Touch the
sphere!

04:15:19.912 --> 04:15:22.047
SAM: Thank you, Halas.

04:15:22.047 --> 04:15:23.072
MATT: You stay hidden?

04:15:23.072 --> 04:15:24.203
DEBORAH: I stay hidden over there.

04:15:24.203 --> 04:15:27.372
MATT: Okay, you got it. You move into the back
area.

04:15:27.372 --> 04:15:28.619
DEBORAH: Yeah, exactly.

04:15:28.619 --> 04:15:30.563
MATT: Got it. Okay, that ends Twiggy's turn. Fire
elemental!

04:15:30.563 --> 04:15:34.245
MARISHA: I'm a dummy!

04:15:34.245 --> 04:15:40.279
MATT: It's going to-- Nott, roll a d6. On a one to
three, it attacks you. On a four to six, it

04:15:40.279 --> 04:15:41.883
attacks the dragon.

04:15:41.883 --> 04:15:42.811
SAM: One.

04:15:42.811 --> 04:15:49.190
MATT: Yeah. With advantage because you're on the
ground. That is a 17.

04:15:49.190 --> 04:15:50.678
SAM: Hits.

04:15:50.678 --> 04:15:54.174
MATT: And a 16.

04:15:54.174 --> 04:15:56.153
SAM: That's my armor class.

04:15:56.153 --> 04:16:07.494
MATT: Yeah, they both hit. You take eight points
of fire damage, and you're on fire.

04:16:07.494 --> 04:16:10.894
SAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge for, I guess, that
one.

04:16:10.894 --> 04:16:15.210
MATT: Okay, so you take four points of fire
damage. The second attack does nine points of fire

04:16:15.210 --> 04:16:20.966
damage to you. That ends the fire elemental's
turn. Nott, you're up.

04:16:20.966 --> 04:16:29.688
SAM: Lying on the ground, I will fire up at the
dragon with my crossbow, trying to quickly load

04:16:29.688 --> 04:16:35.436
one of my explosive charges. He's within five feet
of a friend, yes?

04:16:35.436 --> 04:16:37.514
MATT: He's within five feet of all of you.

04:16:37.514 --> 04:16:39.820
SAM: So it's a sneak attack?

04:16:39.820 --> 04:16:43.819
MATT: It's a sneak attack. Just letting you know,
it's an explosive arrow, and you're adjacent to

04:16:43.819 --> 04:16:44.855
the creature.

04:16:44.855 --> 04:16:46.370
SAM: Sure. Yeah, I'm going for its head.

04:16:46.370 --> 04:16:47.601
MATT: Go for it!

04:16:47.601 --> 04:16:52.489
SAM: Oh boy, that's not great. 18.

04:16:52.489 --> 04:16:54.177
MATT: 18 just hits.

04:16:54.177 --> 04:16:56.488
SAM: Okay.

04:16:56.488 --> 04:17:04.877
MATT: You're prone, so you have disadvantage on
attack rolls, by the way. So you do have to roll again.

04:17:05.396 --> 04:17:07.264
SAM: Shit. Well, can I stand up first?

04:17:07.264 --> 04:17:11.323
MATT: We'll say you stand up. That's half your
movement there.

04:17:11.323 --> 04:17:20.628
SAM: 18, plus whatever the explosion does.

04:17:20.628 --> 04:17:27.563
MATT: The arrow detonates from inside, creating a
fiery explosion in a ten-foot radius around the

04:17:27.563 --> 04:17:31.399
creature that affects you, Caleb, and the fire
elemental. The fire elemental is immune to fire;

04:17:31.399 --> 04:17:35.944
it takes no damage. The dragon, however-- will you
roll 3d6?

04:17:35.944 --> 04:17:37.570
SAM: 3d6?

04:17:37.570 --> 04:17:40.857
MATT: It has to make a dexterity saving throw.
Actually, it does not because it was hit by it.

04:17:40.857 --> 04:17:41.955
SAM: 11.

04:17:41.955 --> 04:17:46.421
MATT: It takes an additional 11 points of fire
damage. Then I need both Caleb and you to roll

04:17:46.421 --> 04:17:49.268
dexterity saving throws.

04:17:49.268 --> 04:17:51.619
LIAM: Four.

04:17:51.619 --> 04:17:52.996
MATT: So you take 11 points of fire damage.

04:17:52.996 --> 04:17:53.828
SAM: 23.

04:17:53.828 --> 04:17:58.949
MATT: You take none because of your evasion. You
roll out of the way (dull explosion). Caleb's

04:17:58.949 --> 04:18:00.523
like, "Ah!"

04:18:00.523 --> 04:18:04.431
SAM: Okay. He's still alive.

04:18:04.431 --> 04:18:06.024
MATT: Still alive.

04:18:06.024 --> 04:18:07.439
SAM: I use half my movement to get up.

04:18:07.439 --> 04:18:11.437
MATT: Correct. You still have a bonus action and
half your movement.

04:18:11.493 --> 04:18:13.628
SAM: I use my bonus action to fire again.

04:18:13.628 --> 04:18:15.336
MATT: Okay, go for it.

04:18:15.336 --> 04:18:16.830
SAM: Natural fucking one!

04:18:16.830 --> 04:18:18.239
LAURA: No!

04:18:18.239 --> 04:18:19.624
MATT: So...

04:18:19.624 --> 04:18:21.750
SAM: Oh. What does that do?

04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:24.800
MATT: You have to make an attack roll against
yourself, don't you? For your weapon?

04:18:24.800 --> 04:18:28.199
SAM: I don't know how this works. If you roll a
one-- I've never done this before-- on a d20

04:18:28.199 --> 04:18:37.011
attack you must succeed in a dexterity saving
throw-- which I don't, or suffer 1d6 piercing

04:18:37.011 --> 04:18:40.496
damage to myself. It's two.

04:18:40.496 --> 04:18:45.921
MATT: As you go to fire a second round, you pull
back and shoot and the mechanism misfires slightly

04:18:45.921 --> 04:18:50.074
and all of a sudden it scrapes you on the side of
the cheek and you're like, "Ah!"

04:18:50.074 --> 04:18:52.355
SAM: Damn it. Okay.

04:18:52.355 --> 04:18:55.141
MATT: Okay. You still have your movement if you
wanted to move.

04:18:55.141 --> 04:19:01.129
SAM: No, because it'll hit me. I mean, I guess
it'll hit me anyway, right?

04:19:01.129 --> 04:19:04.252
MATT: I mean, you can still move within its melee
if you wanted to try and re-maneuver.

04:19:04.252 --> 04:19:08.197
SAM: Okay, I'll walk around away from the fire
guy.

04:19:08.197 --> 04:19:11.960
MATT: Okay. There you go. The fire guy does get an
attack against you.

04:19:11.960 --> 04:19:13.508
SAM: Okay.

04:19:13.508 --> 04:19:15.818
MATT: That is a 12. I don't think that hits you.

04:19:15.818 --> 04:19:16.950
SAM: No.

04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:19.820
MATT: You just manage to avoid it. Okay. Caleb,
you're up.

04:19:19.820 --> 04:19:22.510
LIAM: Fuck. I don't see Jester; she's not here.

04:19:22.510 --> 04:19:23.874
SAM: Well, she left already.

04:19:23.874 --> 04:19:26.075
LIAM: I don't see Twiggy. I heard her voice.

04:19:26.075 --> 04:19:26.881
MATT: Yep.

04:19:26.881 --> 04:19:27.886
LIAM: Nott is up.

04:19:27.886 --> 04:19:28.622
MATT: Yeah.

04:19:28.622 --> 04:19:30.080
LIAM: There is a dragon.

04:19:30.080 --> 04:19:34.726
MATT: Mm-hmm. A dragon that looks hurt, but not
death's door.

04:19:34.726 --> 04:19:36.810
DEBORAH: And a fire elemental.

04:19:36.810 --> 04:19:39.006
MATT: And a fire elemental that is burning
angrily.

04:19:39.006 --> 04:19:40.728
TRAVIS: It's the worst playroom ever.

04:19:40.728 --> 04:19:42.613
SAM: I'm half.

04:19:42.613 --> 04:19:50.950
LIAM: I'm going to cast Expeditious Retreat and
since that is transmutation-- and I smell the

04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:55.692
ozone as soon as I hit the ground-- I am going to
make my Transmuter's Stone make me resistant to lightning.

04:19:56.261 --> 04:19:59.218
MATT: Good call. Okay.

04:19:59.218 --> 04:20:01.648
LIAM: I am going to beeline for the sphere.

04:20:01.648 --> 04:20:02.933
MATT: All right.

04:20:02.933 --> 04:20:06.327
SAM: Caleb, wait for--! Oh, okay. Bye.

04:20:06.327 --> 04:20:08.863
LIAM: Fuck.

04:20:08.863 --> 04:20:13.286
MATT: All right. That brings us to Jester's turn.

04:20:13.286 --> 04:20:14.559
MARISHA: Get out, Jes.

04:20:14.559 --> 04:20:16.079
MATT: Jester.

04:20:16.079 --> 04:20:20.075
LAURA: Oh, I can be ten feet away. I can be ten
feet.

04:20:20.075 --> 04:20:21.194
MATT: Ten feet. That's right.

04:20:21.194 --> 04:20:21.526
TRAVIS: And you can choose.

04:20:21.526 --> 04:20:26.692
LAURA: I mean-- within ten feet, can I get away
from the fire elemental at least?

04:20:26.692 --> 04:20:34.228
MATT: Unfortunately, no. He's placed in a way
where-- I mean, you can. You can go-- oh god!

04:20:34.228 --> 04:20:36.262
LAURA: Oh, I killed him, yay! Everything's fine.

04:20:36.262 --> 04:20:38.283
SAM: You can go farther down the hall or
something?

04:20:38.283 --> 04:20:42.277
MATT: You can go there. That way, the fire
elemental is not within range, and technically the

04:20:42.277 --> 04:20:46.233
dragon-- you're just out of the dragon's range,
although you're going to pass it running.

04:20:46.233 --> 04:20:48.522
LAURA: But I wouldn't-- yeah.

04:20:48.522 --> 04:20:52.980
MATT: You also take one point of fire damage at
the top of the round because you're still on fire.

04:20:53.944 --> 04:20:58.850
LAURA: Okay. I mean, this is so stupid. I'm going
to cast Cure Wounds on myself because I'm going to

04:20:58.850 --> 04:21:06.624
die if I don't, at, I guess-- a couple of
3rd-levels left, so I'm going to cast Cure Wounds.

04:21:08.632 --> 04:21:15.058
Oh good! Two ones and a two. That's great. So four
plus four is eight points healed.

04:21:15.058 --> 04:21:16.843
SAM: Very valuable.

04:21:16.843 --> 04:21:18.071
LAURA: Sure.

04:21:18.071 --> 04:21:23.554
MARISHA: You've got to run. Just run.

04:21:23.554 --> 04:21:26.310
DEBORAH: Dash and take it? Oh, you need a
distraction.

04:21:26.310 --> 04:21:27.883
MARISHA: Run and pray?

04:21:27.883 --> 04:21:31.844
LAURA: I mean, yeah. I'm going to run around as
much as I can.

04:21:31.844 --> 04:21:34.222
MATT: Okay. I mean, there's no way to--

04:21:34.222 --> 04:21:37.893
LAURA: Around the edge of-- without getting hit,
without me leaving his melee.

04:21:37.893 --> 04:21:45.130
MATT: Yeah, so (counting) 30, you can get to.

04:21:45.130 --> 04:21:47.011
LAURA: Then Blink.

04:21:47.011 --> 04:21:48.380
MATT: Roll for your d20.

04:21:48.380 --> 04:21:50.520
TALIESIN: Oh god, come on.

04:21:54.253 --> 04:21:56.366
LAURA: No. I stay.

04:21:56.366 --> 04:21:59.614
MATT: Jester remains. It's now the dragon's turn.

04:21:59.614 --> 04:22:03.044
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

04:22:03.044 --> 04:22:08.972
MATT: It does not regain his lightning breath.
That's good. He's going to go ahead and take three attacks.

04:22:09.538 --> 04:22:12.439
LIAM and SAM: Is he blind?

04:22:12.439 --> 04:22:14.134
MATT: He has blindsight within 30 feet.

04:22:14.134 --> 04:22:16.300
LIAM: Oh. Okay. Yeah, we self-corrected already.

04:22:16.300 --> 04:22:24.042
MATT: Yeah. That's going to be...all right. Yeah,
it's going to be a claw attack on each of you. A

04:22:24.042 --> 04:22:32.357
claw attack against Nott. That's going to be an
eight plus nine, 17?

04:22:32.357 --> 04:22:34.238
SAM: Sure, hits.

04:22:34.238 --> 04:22:40.054
MATT: You take ten points of slashing damage.

04:22:40.054 --> 04:22:46.494
SAM: Okay. I've gone since my last one, so I'll
dodge.

04:22:46.494 --> 04:22:51.618
MATT: Got that, okay. Against Jester, that is a
natural four plus nine; that is a 13 to hit.

04:22:51.618 --> 04:22:53.639
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

04:22:53.639 --> 04:22:59.578
MATT: You deflect it, and it doesn't care much for
Nott necessarily. You've been a threat; it's going

04:22:59.578 --> 04:23:02.136
to go after you, Jester. I'm sorry.

04:23:02.136 --> 04:23:03.671
LAURA: No, it's fine.

04:23:03.671 --> 04:23:13.810
MATT: Natural two. Not even joking. I was looking
at it-- we're not out of the woods yet. As it

04:23:13.810 --> 04:23:20.793
strikes both towards you, there's that moment of
quiet where your eyes close and you're waiting for

04:23:20.793 --> 04:23:26.694
the imminent moment and you hear this voice creep
in your head and go, "Don't worry, I'm watching."

04:23:26.694 --> 04:23:32.463
Your arm-- without even noticing-- you feel a hand
push your wrist and the shield goes up and

04:23:32.463 --> 04:23:39.956
deflects the impact. The teeth streak across it
and cling to it and begin to try to pull the

04:23:39.956 --> 04:23:45.365
shield away and you instinctually muscle it away.
As you do, you watch two teeth shatter and fall to

04:23:45.365 --> 04:23:53.537
the ground in front, that moment of strength
billowing up inside a pretty strong cleric. That's

04:23:53.537 --> 04:23:59.368
the end of the dragon's turn. Caduceus is done,
Fjord is done, and Twiggy.

04:23:59.368 --> 04:24:03.981
SAM: Twiggy, fucking kill this dragon or get us
out of here! Do something!

04:24:03.981 --> 04:24:06.246
LIAM: Mercy kill Jester!

04:24:06.246 --> 04:24:08.163
TRAVIS: Mercy kill.

04:24:08.163 --> 04:24:11.301
MATT: This is the turn, this is the moment.

04:24:11.301 --> 04:24:15.382
TRAVIS: We are best friends.

04:24:15.382 --> 04:24:17.988
SAM: Is the dragon looking at all rough or not
really?

04:24:17.988 --> 04:24:23.381
MATT: It's looking pretty hurt. That's as much as
I can tell you.

04:24:23.381 --> 04:24:26.265
DEBORAH: I'm hidden well, so I have advantage?

04:24:26.265 --> 04:24:27.735
MATT: Yes.

04:24:27.735 --> 04:24:36.478
DEBORAH: Okay. Arrow, snipe it with an arrow. I
come out and I say: You leave my friends alone!

04:24:36.478 --> 04:24:39.801
and I shoot my arrow.

04:24:39.801 --> 04:24:41.303
SAM: Why does Halas like us?

04:24:41.303 --> 04:24:44.541
DEBORAH: 17 plus seven.

04:24:44.541 --> 04:24:48.044
MATT: That hits, roll damage. With sneak attack.

04:24:48.044 --> 04:24:49.638
LAURA: He's so much cuter than I thought he was.

04:24:49.638 --> 04:24:50.307
SAM: And it's way shorter.

04:24:50.307 --> 04:24:59.616
DEBORAH: Seven on the hit and then with sneak,
another seven's 14, another six is 20 on that. 20

04:24:59.616 --> 04:25:01.614
points of damage.

04:25:01.614 --> 04:25:07.012
MATT: Into its throat. You watch it reach up and
with its claw scrape the arrow out of the throat

04:25:07.012 --> 04:25:11.977
and as it does you see a little bit of electricity
arc out from the wound. It's looking pretty hurt.

04:25:11.977 --> 04:25:22.485
DEBORAH: Okay. I'm saying: Save yourselves! and I
attempt to hide again. 19 plus seven.

04:25:22.485 --> 04:25:31.931
MATT: You stealth into your old campaign. That
ends your turn, Twiggy. The fire elemental's turn.

04:25:31.931 --> 04:25:39.742
First, the fire elemental is going to roll against
the dragon, which is the closest enemy currently.

04:25:39.742 --> 04:25:48.856
Natural two, that's a miss. Natural eight. Yeah,
it misses both strikes. It's going to shift around

04:25:48.856 --> 04:25:59.425
to this way. That ends his turn. Nott, you're up.
At the beginning of your turn, you take six points

04:25:59.425 --> 04:26:00.859
of fire damage.

04:26:00.859 --> 04:26:03.806
TRAVIS: My heart rate is literally like I've been
running two miles.

04:26:03.806 --> 04:26:07.550
LAURA: His blindsight; he can see anything within
30 feet?

04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:09.534
MATT: Within 30 feet, he can see through
blindness.

04:26:09.534 --> 04:26:11.238
SAM: It's Nott's turn, not Jester's turn.

04:26:11.238 --> 04:26:12.983
MATT: Correct, it's Nott's turn.

04:26:12.983 --> 04:26:17.105
LAURA: Just go.

04:26:19.929 --> 04:26:23.995
SAM: I will run towards the exit.

04:26:23.995 --> 04:26:25.952
MATT: Okay. Are you disengaging?

04:26:25.952 --> 04:26:26.862
SAM: No.

04:26:26.862 --> 04:26:27.623
MATT: Okay.

04:26:27.623 --> 04:26:28.312
LAURA: What?

04:26:28.312 --> 04:26:29.266
DEBORAH: You can as an action.

04:26:29.266 --> 04:26:30.125
LAURA: Disengage!

04:26:30.125 --> 04:26:31.441
TALIESIN and SAM: No.

04:26:31.441 --> 04:26:32.512
DEBORAH: Or as a bonus action.

04:26:32.512 --> 04:26:36.764
MATT: Going to run to the front; it makes an
attack of opportunity against you. That's going to

04:26:36.764 --> 04:26:45.456
hit. That's a 15 plus nine, yeah, it's 24. It's
going to be a bite attack against you, which does

04:26:45.456 --> 04:26:51.928
more damage. That's going to be 18 points of
piercing damage.

04:26:51.928 --> 04:26:54.311
SAM: Mm-hmm. I'm okay.

04:26:54.311 --> 04:26:58.869
MATT: The jaws bite into you and you feel it rake
across your shoulder, but you manage to pull out,

04:26:58.869 --> 04:27:03.260
roll on the ground to back up and you manage to
get your arm up and pull yourself onto the

04:27:03.260 --> 04:27:05.745
platform where the orb is still glowing that dull
green color.

04:27:05.745 --> 04:27:09.917
SAM: I'll turn around and fire my crossbow at the
thing.

04:27:09.917 --> 04:27:11.633
MATT: Go for it.

04:27:11.633 --> 04:27:15.448
SAM: It's not great. It's only a 16.

04:27:15.448 --> 04:27:21.094
MATT: The bolt ricochets off of the hard scales of
the dragon's hide.

04:27:21.094 --> 04:27:25.569
SAM: If I use my bonus action to fire again, I
can't touch the thing, right?

04:27:25.569 --> 04:27:28.404
LAURA: Just go.

04:27:28.404 --> 04:27:29.951
MATT: What are you doing, man?

04:27:29.951 --> 04:27:35.740
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out. You've done enough. You
did enough! Don't do it!

04:27:35.740 --> 04:27:37.992
MARISHA: She can go now if he uses his reaction.

04:27:37.992 --> 04:27:40.953
LAURA: Go!

04:27:40.953 --> 04:27:42.088
SAM: I'll go.

04:27:48.277 --> 04:27:50.276
MARISHA: Jester's next, right?

04:27:50.276 --> 04:27:57.693
MATT: All right, Jester's turn. At the beginning
of your turn, you take fire damage. Six points of

04:27:57.693 --> 04:27:59.077
fire damage.

04:27:59.077 --> 04:28:00.252
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

04:28:00.252 --> 04:28:02.065
DEBORAH: It's only a ten. It's okay.

04:28:02.065 --> 04:28:06.282
LAURA: Okay. He used his reaction, right?

04:28:06.282 --> 04:28:09.997
MATT: He did. Jester's out.

04:28:09.997 --> 04:28:11.955
(groans of relief)

04:28:11.955 --> 04:28:13.125
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

04:28:13.125 --> 04:28:14.425
TALIESIN: Fuck!

04:28:14.425 --> 04:28:17.100
MATT: Dragon's turn.

04:28:17.100 --> 04:28:18.961
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Is that a one?!

04:28:18.961 --> 04:28:21.139
SAM: Yeah, I got one hit point.

04:28:21.139 --> 04:28:24.813
MATT: (laughing) Holy shit!

04:28:24.813 --> 04:28:26.442
LAURA: One hit point.

04:28:26.442 --> 04:28:28.167
TRAVIS: You had one after the 18?

04:28:28.167 --> 04:28:31.312
SAM: Yeah.

04:28:31.878 --> 04:28:35.668
MATT: The dragon's going to wail on the elemental;
it can't see anything else around it. Let's see if

04:28:35.668 --> 04:28:38.687
it gets the-- Does not get its--

04:28:38.687 --> 04:28:41.406
TRAVIS: Please tell me the dragon can't touch the
sphere.

04:28:41.406 --> 04:28:51.304
MATT: That's a hit, and a hit, and a miss on the
jaws. That's seven damage for the elemental, if

04:28:51.304 --> 04:28:53.109
you want to keep track of this.

04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:54.956
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, and 40 hp.

04:28:54.956 --> 04:28:59.826
MATT: Ooh, double sixes. That's 17 points of
slashing damage to it.

04:28:59.826 --> 04:29:01.668
SAM: Get out of there!

04:29:01.668 --> 04:29:08.058
TRAVIS: The intro's been up one week. The
animation takes a long time!

04:29:08.058 --> 04:29:11.638
MATT: The dragon takes another six points from the
fire. The dragon's hurt real bad.

04:29:11.638 --> 04:29:12.621
TRAVIS: Who's hurting real bad?

04:29:12.621 --> 04:29:16.966
MATT: The dragon's hurt real bad. That's going to
end its turn, everyone else goes by-- Twiggy,

04:29:16.966 --> 04:29:17.947
you're up.

04:29:17.947 --> 04:29:19.353
DEBORAH: Am I, or is it the elemental who goes
first?

04:29:19.353 --> 04:29:20.726
MATT: You go before the elemental.

04:29:20.726 --> 04:29:25.167
DEBORAH: I go first? All right. I'm going to come
out of hiding. I'm going to fire an arrow with advantage.

04:29:25.612 --> 04:29:26.951
MATT: Go for it.

04:29:26.951 --> 04:29:28.440
MARISHA: Last man standing, Twiggy!

04:29:28.440 --> 04:29:29.220
DEBORAH: Natural 20!

04:29:29.220 --> 04:29:35.772
(screaming, cheering)

04:29:35.772 --> 04:29:43.007
MATT: Roll damage. We'll see if it's enough.

04:29:43.952 --> 04:29:45.760
DEBORAH: Nine plus four, for the hit.

04:29:45.760 --> 04:29:47.691
MATT: Okay, nine plus four, so 13.

04:29:47.691 --> 04:29:48.900
DEBORAH: 13--

04:29:48.900 --> 04:29:50.206
ALL: Double the dice!

04:29:50.206 --> 04:29:54.397
DEBORAH: I doubled the dice for the hit, that was
2d6 before-- so that's for the hit-- but I get 8d6

04:29:54.397 --> 04:29:56.069
on my sneak?

04:29:56.069 --> 04:29:57.273
LIAM: Double that sneak attack damage!

04:29:57.273 --> 04:29:58.951
MATT: You can either just roll the sneak attack
and then double the number, or roll twice as many

04:29:58.951 --> 04:30:02.185
dice, it's up to you.

04:30:02.185 --> 04:30:05.721
DEBORAH: That's nine. That's another ten is 19--

04:30:05.721 --> 04:30:07.312
LAURA: Double that!

04:30:07.312 --> 04:30:11.005
DEBORAH: Double that to 38.

04:30:11.005 --> 04:30:13.621
MATT: How do you want to do this?

04:30:13.621 --> 04:30:15.644
(cheering)

04:30:15.644 --> 04:30:17.403
LAURA: Oh my god! Why aren't we there? We can't
see them!

04:30:17.403 --> 04:30:19.011
DEBORAH: No one's going to see my moment of
triumph!

04:30:19.011 --> 04:30:20.272
LIAM: No one's going to believe her!

04:30:20.272 --> 04:30:21.714
TRAVIS: No, nobody--

04:30:21.714 --> 04:30:23.009
MATT: Quiet, shh.

04:30:23.009 --> 04:30:32.011
DEBORAH: I step out and I put on my meanest face
that I learned from Sir Cadigan, and--

04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:33.756
MATT: Still in the form?

04:30:33.756 --> 04:30:43.576
DEBORAH: Still as Halas, hundred percent as
Halas-- and I say: This is for my only friends!

04:30:43.576 --> 04:30:55.643
Come straight forward, and I want to hit him in
the heart because he broke my heart.

04:30:55.643 --> 04:31:00.951
MATT: (heavy breathing and steps) It stumbles
forward towards you now that you're visible, its

04:31:00.951 --> 04:31:05.307
eyes blinking in and out, looking confused, still,
with the shape, and goes--

04:31:05.307 --> 04:31:07.785
DEBORAH: Now I drop it.

04:31:07.785 --> 04:31:19.579
MATT: (low chuckling, impact) And falls to the
ground and collapses, exhaling, bits of energy arc

04:31:19.579 --> 04:31:22.263
out of its snout and dissipate into the stone
around there. The dragon is dead.

04:31:22.263 --> 04:31:26.124
DEBORAH: Cool. There's still a fire elemental,
right?

04:31:26.124 --> 04:31:27.753
MATT: Yup. (roaring flame)

04:31:27.753 --> 04:31:30.315
LIAM: Fist fight.

04:31:30.315 --> 04:31:37.073
DEBORAH: Bonus action: is there a piece of tooth
in reach? I'd like to take a tooth with me, a

04:31:37.073 --> 04:31:38.926
dragon tooth.

04:31:38.926 --> 04:31:41.814
MATT: You can, but it's either that or touch the
sphere.

04:31:41.814 --> 04:31:43.084
DEBORAH: Okay, I'll touch the sphere.

04:31:43.084 --> 04:31:45.392
(laughter)

04:31:45.392 --> 04:31:46.751
SAM: I mean, I'm not crazy!

04:31:46.751 --> 04:31:48.807
DEBORAH: You said two fell on the ground, I
thought--

04:31:48.807 --> 04:31:53.503
MATT: They did. They're scattered over in this
corner. It'd be a move, grab it, and then go.

04:31:53.503 --> 04:31:55.499
DEBORAH: Okay, I'm gone. We're good.

04:31:55.499 --> 04:31:59.571
MATT: Okay. (exhales)

04:31:59.571 --> 04:32:02.364
TRAVIS: What are the rules of drinking hard liquor
on Twitch?

04:32:02.364 --> 04:32:06.629
TALIESIN: I am ready with stabilization magic for
everybody. Everybody's going to be fine!

04:32:06.629 --> 04:32:10.378
MARISHA: How many hit points did you have?

04:32:10.378 --> 04:32:13.755
LAURA: By the end I had 13, but if he had hit me
one more time--

04:32:13.755 --> 04:32:15.068
MARISHA: You would have been gone.

04:32:15.068 --> 04:32:15.715
LAURA: Yeah.

04:32:15.715 --> 04:32:18.325
TRAVIS: Nott, you took that with 19 hit points?

04:32:18.325 --> 04:32:21.448
LIAM: To burn the reaction, yeah.

04:32:21.448 --> 04:32:22.757
MARISHA: To get the reaction, yeah.

04:32:22.757 --> 04:32:23.528
TALIESIN: She could have grabbed him, worst case
scenario.

04:32:23.528 --> 04:32:27.006
MARISHA: That was Nott, the Bravest.

04:32:27.006 --> 04:32:29.955
LAURA: That was Nott, the Brave.

04:32:29.955 --> 04:32:34.005
MATT: As you all, one by one, emerge, beaten, on
fire--

04:32:34.005 --> 04:32:35.512
SAM: Jesus.

04:32:35.512 --> 04:32:42.549
MATT: Help put it out, for those who are still
burning in flames, you find yourselves back in the

04:32:42.549 --> 04:32:51.941
hull of the ship. You see the crew, half of the
crew is sitting there, looking intense, the sphere

04:32:51.941 --> 04:32:56.007
resting on the center of one of the tables off to
the side, and as soon as the first of you emerge,

04:32:56.007 --> 04:33:00.784
they're like, (starts) "Where have you been?!
What's going on?" Orly pushes forward and goes,

04:33:00.784 --> 04:33:10.855
"Where all you been hanging?" (whooshing) A few
more appear. (impacts) Eventually, everyone makes

04:33:10.855 --> 04:33:11.942
their way out of the sphere.

04:33:11.942 --> 04:33:15.316
DEBORAH: You guys, I did it! I killed the dragon
all by myself!

04:33:15.316 --> 04:33:16.633
MARISHA and SAM: What?

04:33:16.633 --> 04:33:18.811
SAM: No, the dragon was alive, we just left.

04:33:18.811 --> 04:33:20.204
DEBORAH: Aww, man.

04:33:20.204 --> 04:33:24.268
(laughter)

04:33:24.268 --> 04:33:25.871
SAM: Did you really?

04:33:25.871 --> 04:33:27.256
DEBORAH: I really did.

04:33:27.256 --> 04:33:28.933
MARISHA: Aww, Jessie...

04:33:28.933 --> 04:33:31.573
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll that shit, Caduceus.

04:33:31.573 --> 04:33:39.260
TALIESIN: Goddamn. Way to go, that's-- Did you get
anything from him?

04:33:39.260 --> 04:33:43.006
DEBORAH: I really tried to take a tooth, but I
figured it'd be better to live.

04:33:43.006 --> 04:33:44.704
TALIESIN: Yeah, aw man.

04:33:44.704 --> 04:33:48.017
MATT: You hear a clattering sound, and you glance
down and you see, stuck in the side of your boot,

04:33:48.017 --> 04:33:49.948
what looks like one of the errant dragon tooths.

04:33:49.948 --> 04:33:52.066
(cheering)

04:33:52.066 --> 04:33:56.316
DEBORAH: I take it and I put it in my bag, and I
go: This'll be good for later.

04:33:56.316 --> 04:34:03.014
SAM: I'm going to go over to Jester and take the
flower out of her head and be like: I think it

04:34:03.014 --> 04:34:05.530
worked. I'm going to take it back now.

04:34:05.530 --> 04:34:11.432
LAURA: I turn and give Nott the biggest hug, just
bury my head in her.

04:34:11.432 --> 04:34:15.118
MATT: Marius is like, "We've been waiting here for
seven days."

04:34:15.118 --> 04:34:16.252
SAM: Oh, shit.

04:34:16.252 --> 04:34:18.571
MARISHA: What?! Are you serious?

04:34:18.571 --> 04:34:19.806
MATT: "Yeah!"

04:34:19.806 --> 04:34:22.391
TRAVIS: Where are we?

04:34:22.391 --> 04:34:28.823
MATT: "We're at Bisaft. Our repairs finished like
a day ago and we haven't paid yet because you've

04:34:28.908 --> 04:34:33.539
"been fucking gone! The Dockmaster's not happy!"

04:34:33.539 --> 04:34:37.691
DEBORAH: Is the Ball of Fun there?

04:34:37.691 --> 04:34:41.055
MATT: Yeah, it's sitting on a table. They've all
been rallied around it, trying to figure out-- You

04:34:41.055 --> 04:34:43.256
guys vanished, and this was all that was left.

04:34:43.256 --> 04:34:45.493
TALIESIN: I wouldn't touch that. That's a lot.

04:34:45.493 --> 04:34:46.884
MATT: "We figured that was the case!"

04:34:46.884 --> 04:34:48.207
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:34:48.207 --> 04:34:51.179
LAURA: It's probably safe to touch now, I mean,
the dragon's dead.

04:34:51.179 --> 04:34:57.261
TRAVIS: Marius, do me a favor. Just tell us how
much repairs cost and let's all settle in for the

04:34:57.261 --> 04:35:01.446
night. We're going to-- Still on fire.

04:35:01.446 --> 04:35:02.560
MARISHA: Sorry.

04:35:02.560 --> 04:35:03.856
TRAVIS: We're going to need it.

04:35:03.856 --> 04:35:11.735
MATT: "All right, it's about 130 gold for the
masts, getting the various bits of the sails

04:35:11.735 --> 04:35:13.439
"repaired and fixed and everything."

04:35:13.439 --> 04:35:15.258
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:35:15.258 --> 04:35:18.187
MATT: "All right, I'll get them paid." Mark down
that amount.

04:35:18.187 --> 04:35:20.075
TRAVIS: 130 gone.

04:35:20.075 --> 04:35:23.823
LIAM: Twiggy, do you have that jar of beads?

04:35:23.823 --> 04:35:29.045
DEBORAH: I did take it. Right? I use my hand. I do
have that jar of beads.

04:35:29.045 --> 04:35:30.804
LIAM: Are you attached to it?

04:35:30.804 --> 04:35:32.125
DEBORAH: Oh, no, you can have it.

04:35:32.125 --> 04:35:33.512
LIAM: Thank you.

04:35:33.512 --> 04:35:35.566
DEBORAH: I pass the beads over to him.

04:35:35.566 --> 04:35:36.731
LIAM: I walk off.

04:35:36.731 --> 04:35:37.732
DEBORAH: How you feeling?

04:35:37.732 --> 04:35:39.523
LIAM: I walk off.

04:35:39.523 --> 04:35:45.753
TALIESIN: If you stick around, I'm going to be
helping every-- I'm doing a thing.

04:35:45.753 --> 04:35:47.498
LIAM: Already gone.

04:35:47.498 --> 04:35:52.005
TALIESIN: Okay. 23 points to everybody who's
hanging around for a few minutes.

04:35:52.005 --> 04:35:53.058
TRAVIS: How many?

04:35:53.058 --> 04:35:54.692
MATT and TALIESIN: 23 points.

04:35:54.692 --> 04:35:56.064
TALIESIN: It's been a long day.

04:35:56.064 --> 04:35:58.077
DEBORAH: Yes, it has.

04:35:58.077 --> 04:36:09.947
TRAVIS: Well, let's just call that lesson learned,
yeah? Maybe we should all reconnoiter in the morning.

04:36:09.947 --> 04:36:17.043
TALIESIN: Sometimes mysterious spheres just happen
to you, if I'm learning anything.

04:36:17.043 --> 04:36:21.442
TRAVIS: The good news is is that if Twiggy
actually killed the dragon-- which you obviously did--

04:36:21.442 --> 04:36:22.301
DEBORAH: Thanks.

04:36:22.301 --> 04:36:23.934
TRAVIS: We can go back.

04:36:23.934 --> 04:36:25.496
SAM: I don't want--

04:36:25.496 --> 04:36:26.995
TALIESIN: I mean, maybe, sure.

04:36:26.995 --> 04:36:29.541
LAURA: There were lots of jewels on the ground.

04:36:29.541 --> 04:36:31.340
TRAVIS: Yeah, it sounded bad when it came out.

04:36:31.340 --> 04:36:37.311
DEBORAH: Well, I just want to say that this was
the most fun adventure I've ever had in my lives

04:36:37.311 --> 04:36:43.883
and you guys are the bestest friends that I've
ever had, and I think you should keep the Ball of

04:36:43.883 --> 04:36:50.991
Fun, but I'd be very careful because Sir Cadigan's
after it. I better keep moving, so I might get off

04:36:50.991 --> 04:36:52.193
here, you guys.

04:36:52.193 --> 04:36:53.322
LAURA: You don't want to stay with us?

04:36:53.322 --> 04:36:58.194
DEBORAH: You guys have been the greatest friends
ever, but I've spent my whole life in a box. I'm

04:36:58.194 --> 04:37:00.260
going to go exploring.

04:37:00.260 --> 04:37:01.037
SAM: Oh.

04:37:01.037 --> 04:37:03.001
LAURA: I understand that.

04:37:03.001 --> 04:37:04.338
DEBORAH: Thanks.

04:37:04.338 --> 04:37:07.876
SAM: It was nice to meet you and nearly die next
to you.

04:37:07.876 --> 04:37:12.748
DEBORAH: Thanks for saving my life. (as Trixie)
Yeah, thanks for that!

04:37:12.748 --> 04:37:17.294
TRAVIS: As an honorary member of The Mighty Nein,
just do us a favor and make sure you tell your

04:37:17.294 --> 04:37:19.458
story far and wide, yeah?

04:37:19.458 --> 04:37:23.252
DEBORAH: I shall. I shall speak of your bravery to
all that I meet.

04:37:23.252 --> 04:37:26.735
TALIESIN: Lets pack some food and some tea and
stuff before you go, you're going to need some--

04:37:26.735 --> 04:37:28.239
DEBORAH: Oh, I've got chocolate!

04:37:28.239 --> 04:37:30.386
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to go get some food.

04:37:30.386 --> 04:37:35.037
MARISHA: Thanks, Twiggy. I'm sorry I found your
cuteness alarming.

04:37:35.037 --> 04:37:43.123
DEBORAH: I have that effect on people. I put my
hood up and two little Twiggys stand there and go

04:37:43.123 --> 04:37:45.073
Bye, bye!

04:37:45.073 --> 04:37:46.784
TALIESIN: Oh, that's weird.

04:37:46.784 --> 04:37:51.411
LAURA: I would do that too, but I think I'm out of
the ability.

04:37:51.411 --> 04:37:53.679
DEBORAH: I'm all out.

04:37:53.679 --> 04:37:55.504
LIAM: You stowing away, is that what's happening?

04:37:55.504 --> 04:38:00.382
DEBORAH: Yes, I go up to the gangplank, or
whatever's attached to the dock, and I wave and

04:38:00.382 --> 04:38:04.698
say: Be good, be brave! Thanks for the adventure!

04:38:04.698 --> 04:38:06.251
LIAM: Halas.

04:38:06.251 --> 04:38:08.287
SAM: Bye!

04:38:08.287 --> 04:38:10.588
TRAVIS: Make good life choices!

04:38:10.588 --> 04:38:13.155
DEBORAH: I'll back up down the plank.

04:38:13.155 --> 04:38:18.631
TRAVIS: She's leaving us, it's the best life
choice.

04:38:18.631 --> 04:38:23.202
MATT: You watch her gnomish form vanish off the
docks and mingle with the rest of the villagers of Bisaft.

04:38:23.202 --> 04:38:25.294
MARISHA: Well, that was the weirdest seven days I
didn't know I had.

04:38:25.294 --> 04:38:27.453
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:38:27.453 --> 04:38:30.011
MARISHA: Jester, are you all right?

04:38:30.011 --> 04:38:32.113
LAURA: Oh, yeah, of course. I'm fine.

04:38:32.113 --> 04:38:34.942
MARISHA: You're a bad liar.

04:38:34.942 --> 04:38:38.615
LAURA: (laughter) I'm a really good liar, Beau.

04:38:38.615 --> 04:38:40.951
MARISHA: Sure.

04:38:40.951 --> 04:38:51.942
LAURA: I'm going to go to my room. (shuddering
sigh) And go to sleep.

04:38:51.942 --> 04:38:54.436
LIAM: Are you okay?

04:38:54.436 --> 04:38:57.758
SAM: Am I okay? Yes, I'm fine. Are you okay?

04:38:57.758 --> 04:39:00.325
LIAM: (quietly) Would you jump up here?

04:39:00.325 --> 04:39:01.701
SAM: Would I what?

04:39:01.701 --> 04:39:03.252
LIAM: Would you jump up?

04:39:03.252 --> 04:39:04.316
SAM: Onto you?

04:39:04.316 --> 04:39:05.364
LIAM: Yeah.

04:39:05.364 --> 04:39:12.780
SAM: I will jump up onto Caleb and I will give him
a big kiss on his nose, and I will whip out the

04:39:12.780 --> 04:39:19.196
last book I had. We still have books to go
through!

04:39:19.196 --> 04:39:30.424
LIAM: I'll look at those tomorrow. Let's go get
some sleep. I start walking off towards our quarters.

04:39:34.674 --> 04:39:35.899
MARISHA: Hey, Fjord?

04:39:36.344 --> 04:39:38.156
TRAVIS: Yep?

04:39:38.156 --> 04:39:44.589
MARISHA: I feel like there's this trend of us
feeling shitty after we come out of a fight.

04:39:44.589 --> 04:39:53.964
TRAVIS: Right. I'd say something about that that
doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I feel

04:39:53.964 --> 04:39:57.001
pretty fucking weak right now.

04:39:57.001 --> 04:39:58.606
MARISHA: Hmm.

04:40:00.306 --> 04:40:02.250
TRAVIS: That was a dragon.

04:40:02.989 --> 04:40:11.693
MARISHA: That was a dragon. I don't even know what
any of it meant.

04:40:14.485 --> 04:40:22.608
TRAVIS: That little crazy Ball o' Fun is a
troublemaker. Just like Twiggy.

04:40:25.175 --> 04:40:30.165
MARISHA: Well, I guess there's still time to
figure it all out.

04:40:31.192 --> 04:40:35.061
TRAVIS: Maybe we just leave that particular
function alone for a while and collect some gold

04:40:35.061 --> 04:40:38.369
to recoup our repair costs.

04:40:39.169 --> 04:40:43.335
MARISHA: It feels like that gold was stealing from
the dragon, just slowly but surely.

04:40:43.335 --> 04:40:45.795
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

04:40:45.795 --> 04:40:53.183
MARISHA: Yeah. Anyway... But he's dead now, so
what does it matter? We could just slowly drain

04:40:53.183 --> 04:40:55.609
it. It's like a never-ending piggy bank.

04:40:55.609 --> 04:40:59.127
TRAVIS: Yeah, if a big, blue finger comes through
the hole, we'll know Twiggy lied.

04:40:59.127 --> 04:41:00.884
MARISHA: That's true.

04:41:00.884 --> 04:41:04.392
TRAVIS: I'm going to go get rid of this concussion
now.

04:41:06.123 --> 04:41:13.319
MARISHA: I guess I'm going to stay up. I don't
feel like sleeping just yet.

04:41:13.319 --> 04:41:18.377
TRAVIS: All right, first mate, you got the con.

04:41:18.377 --> 04:41:20.046
MARISHA: Copy that, captain.

04:41:20.046 --> 04:41:22.773
TRAVIS: (groans)

04:41:27.033 --> 04:41:32.456
TALIESIN: I'm probably going to come out about
halfway through your shift with a pot and two

04:41:32.456 --> 04:41:41.291
cups. Another day.

04:41:41.291 --> 04:41:45.186
MARISHA: How are you?

04:41:45.186 --> 04:41:49.316
TALIESIN: Weirdly, I think I'm great.

04:41:53.167 --> 04:41:55.199
MARISHA: Oddly, I feel okay too.

04:41:55.199 --> 04:41:56.975
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

04:41:57.325 --> 04:41:59.032
MARISHA: Is that wrong of me?

04:41:59.032 --> 04:41:59.886
TALIESIN: No.

04:41:59.886 --> 04:42:01.740
MARISHA: I feel like everyone else feels so
terribly.

04:42:02.387 --> 04:42:06.778
TALIESIN: Well, in the morning, we're going to
comfort everybody. We're going to take care of

04:42:06.778 --> 04:42:12.291
them, we're going to feed them. It's going to be
our job to feel good for them and bring them back

04:42:12.291 --> 04:42:15.389
around. They did good work, they just don't
believe it.

04:42:17.885 --> 04:42:25.140
MARISHA: I think I oddly feel the most comfortable
when things are a fraction away from going

04:42:25.140 --> 04:42:26.870
terribly wrong.

04:42:28.812 --> 04:42:36.109
TALIESIN: Something's happening. I don't know
what, but something's happening. And you did good.

04:42:36.109 --> 04:42:40.278
MARISHA: So did you.

04:42:40.278 --> 04:42:46.678
TALIESIN: Thank you. Do better next time to keep
everybody safe.

04:42:50.389 --> 04:42:54.665
MATT: You both quietly sit there, drinking your
tea, finishing off the watch while the rest of

04:42:54.665 --> 04:43:01.841
your group sleeps soundly in their midday bunks,
recovering from the strenuous activities of

04:43:01.841 --> 04:43:15.725
surviving three chambers of a hundred-chambered
mage vault extraplanar home. We'll end it there

04:43:15.725 --> 04:43:18.749
and pick up on that next week.

04:43:19.099 --> 04:43:20.429
SAM: Wow!

04:43:20.429 --> 04:43:27.637
MATT: Well done guys, holy shit! We have this
ridiculous trend of guests killing bosses from the

04:43:27.637 --> 04:43:29.054
last campaign.

04:43:29.054 --> 04:43:30.313
LAURA: It's the craziest thing!

04:43:30.313 --> 04:43:32.351
SAM: Killing a dragon with a natural 20!

04:43:32.351 --> 04:43:37.263
LIAM: What a fucking delight Twiggy was!

04:43:37.263 --> 04:43:40.596
LAURA: Twiggy forever!

04:43:40.596 --> 04:43:43.459
TALIESIN: You had some weird-ass spells up, right?
You had some weird-ass shit that I didn't know

04:43:43.459 --> 04:43:47.446
about. I saw them, but I never really poked. You
don't have to tell me what it was; did you have

04:43:47.446 --> 04:43:49.943
some weird shit that if I had prodded it would
have been a thing?

04:43:49.943 --> 04:43:50.589
DEBORAH: No.

04:43:50.589 --> 04:43:52.023
TALIESIN: All right, okay, let's just do that
then.

04:43:52.023 --> 04:43:57.062
DEBORAH: No, I'm very normal. I just do weird
stuff with my normal stuff.

04:43:57.062 --> 04:43:58.501
MATT: I like that.

04:43:58.501 --> 04:44:00.061
LIAM: Descriptive.

04:44:00.061 --> 04:44:03.738
MATT: Thank you guys so much for watching. Thank
you again, Deborah, for joining. You were such a

04:44:03.738 --> 04:44:07.688
joy. Was there anything you want to talk about or
plug before we leave?

04:44:07.688 --> 04:44:15.154
DEBORAH: Oh yeah! I have a game coming out. We're
doing a show with Geek &amp; Sundry called Relics and

04:44:15.154 --> 04:44:20.105
Rarities, and it's super silly and fun and great
and I hope that everyone will love it, and I just

04:44:20.105 --> 04:44:23.779
want to say a big thank you to you guys because I
don't think that would be possible either for me

04:44:23.779 --> 04:44:28.857
without all of you paving the way and being so
supportive and so incredible and so inspiring.

04:44:28.857 --> 04:44:30.592
Thank you so much!

04:44:30.592 --> 04:44:32.163
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's awesome.

04:44:32.163 --> 04:44:34.293
LAURA: That set looks killer!

04:44:34.293 --> 04:44:35.739
MATT: It looks so good.

04:44:35.739 --> 04:44:37.311
DEBORAH: It's so cool. Thank you guys.

04:44:37.311 --> 04:44:38.506
LIAM: Thanks for playing.

04:44:38.506 --> 04:44:42.938
MATT: Thank you guys. Have a wonderful night.
We'll see you next week. We love you, and is it

04:44:42.938 --> 04:44:45.797
Thursday yet? Good night.

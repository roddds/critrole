00:00:00.635 --> 00:00:03.071
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:07.900
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Before we dive into tonight's

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.807
episode, we have some announcements to get
through, so hang tight for just a moment. We have

00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:16.545
two fantastic sponsors for tonight's episode, the
first, of course, our fantastic returning friends

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:21.243
and allies in this Campaign Two: D&amp;amp;D Beyond. Sam?

00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:26.214
SAM: D&amp;amp;D Beyond, everybody. It's almost
Thanksgiving time and I thought, what better for

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:34.325
us to do than to thank our long-time sponsor D&amp;amp;D
Beyond. They've been with us all campaign, we hope

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:41.107
into the next year, so as a token of our
appreciation, we put together a highlight reel of

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:48.392
all my best moments from all the best D&amp;amp;D Beyond
ads of the year, so roll that clip, gentlemen, and

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:54.912
we're going to-- Hold on. I've just been handed
something. Okay. I'm being told that we don't have

00:00:54.912 --> 00:01:02.985
that clip, which is disappointing because we had
meetings about this all week, I talked to editors

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:10.498
about this, and this was important to me, and to--
Okay, sorry. Okay, I'm being told that we did not

00:01:10.498 --> 00:01:17.577
have meetings all week about this, and this is a
bit that I wrote about an hour ago. Needless to

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:22.390
say, I feel like D&amp;amp;D Beyond is going to not like
this because we've taken them on this

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.740
rollercoaster of emotions now, and they're going
to be pretty pissed off, they may pull their

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.784
sponsorship dollars-- Okay, now I'm being told
that no, they will not pull their sponsorship

00:01:32.784 --> 00:01:40.571
dollars because they really just want me to read
the ad copy that they provided me two days ago. So

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:45.698
I'll just read that now, and they'll be happy. As
a reminder from last week, Dungeon of the Mad Mage

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:50.733
and the Magic: The Gathering D&amp;amp;D crossover,
Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica, are available now

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:58.183
in the D&amp;amp;D Beyond marketplace. Be sure to pick up
yours at dndbeyond.com/marketplace. Okay, fine, so

00:01:58.183 --> 00:02:05.964
maybe they're a great company, but I feel like
they're going to resent me for-- I am being told

00:02:05.964 --> 00:02:13.616
that no, they're not going to resent me at all,
and in fact they have a promo code named after me.

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:20.642
The promo code is "SamIsOurHero"-- not case
sensitive-- it can be used right now for 25% off

00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:24.883
all digital books, including those two books I
just mentioned earlier, so go to the store right

00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:32.045
now and use it. Okay, forget about D&amp;amp;D Beyond, all
right? The fans will be pissed off at me, right?

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:37.539
They will think that I'm an awful human being,
they'll drag my name on Reddit-- I'm being told

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:42.334
now that there's nothing written on any of these
pieces of paper, and this is just a thinly-veiled

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:49.490
attempt to get attention to myself because I am
very insecure, I have these deep-seated problems,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.640
and-- I'm being told now that I'm actually pretty
happy, and I don't have any deep-seated depression

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.824
or anything like that, and I'm a pretty good guy.
Wow, I really think, guys, that this bit has been

00:03:04.824 --> 00:03:11.272
a journey for all of us, and I feel like we've all
learned something about ourselves, and about--

00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:16.738
Nope, I'm being told we have not learned anything,
and that I'm to wrap it up, so back to you, Matt!

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:20.218
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:20.218 --> 00:03:22.451
TRAVIS: We're going to recycle all those papers,
right?

00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:31.296
MATT: Yes. May you enjoy your ever-future in race
car beds. Thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond, for being our

00:03:31.296 --> 00:03:37.145
friends and allies in this. Our secondary sponsor
tonight is the fantastic company Thinkfun's

00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:42.967
Shadows in the Forest game. For those who haven't
seen it, this is the reimagining of the classic

00:03:42.967 --> 00:03:49.103
game Waldschattenspiel-- I know I pronounced it
terribly-- but Thinkfun licensed it, maybe.

00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:55.684
Shadows in the Forest is the only collaborative
board game that you actually play in the dark. In

00:03:55.684 --> 00:04:01.190
the game you play as Shadowlings, they're these
scattered gnomish-like creatures that hide in the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.941
shadows and live in the forest, and it's really
cool. You all have to work together to try and

00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:08.399
meet under a singular tree on the board while one
of the players plays as a lantern, an actual

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:12.965
physical lantern that gives off light, and so you
can only move within the shadows, and if the

00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:13.971
player moves the light--

00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:15.040
SAM: That sounds awesome!

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.217
MATT: It's really cool.

00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:19.369
TALIESIN: I brought a copy, actually, I forgot to
bring it out onto the table, but I have a copy

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:20.368
that we'll probably play.

00:04:20.368 --> 00:04:22.511
MATT: It's really cool, because if you're playing
one of the shadows and you're caught in the light,

00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:26.353
you can't move, and if the person who's playing
the light manages to catch all the Shadowlings in

00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:31.265
the light, they win, but if all the Shadowlings
manage to meet under there-- It actually uses--

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:35.506
MARISHA: They did a creepy animation for a promo
that's during the break.

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:40.330
TALIESIN: It's got little stand-up trees, and the
little creatures are very Miyazaki-looking, and

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:47.047
the whole thing's got a very Candyland for goth
kids vibe. The dice glow, which I also think is

00:04:47.047 --> 00:04:48.225
really cool.

00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:54.161
MATT: It's pretty fun. So you can check it out on
Amazon, and it's currently at 20% off there for a

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:58.559
limited time, so make sure to pick up your copy
now if you plan to. It is Shadows in the Forest,

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:06.731
and it is awesome and I'm really excited to try it
out. Next up, lets see, Travis do you want to go

00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:08.670
ahead and talk a little bit about Operation Supply
Drop?

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.499
TRAVIS: Yes! Operation Supply Drop is my charity
that we are supporting this November in honor of

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:17.247
Veterans Day. OSD is an amazing charity. They've
helped over 750,000 members of the military

00:05:17.247 --> 00:05:22.174
community. In active service, in their transition
back to civilian life, they help the families of

00:05:22.174 --> 00:05:28.990
the people that have served. These guys are so
great. They have skill fairs, they help people

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.496
with job training, resumes, anything that'll take
them from being a military back into the real

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:39.264
world. To me, it's so personal. My family has been
in the military for, oh god, decades. So if you

00:05:39.264 --> 00:05:43.986
can, share with your friends and family, give a
little love. Everything you need to know about the

00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:49.012
charity, or just donate, is at critrole.com/osd.

00:05:49.012 --> 00:05:54.783
MATT: Thank you guys for your amazing support of
this initiative. It's been awesome to watch all

00:05:54.783 --> 00:05:59.041
the Critters come together to help support our
troops there. It's been awesome. We also have a

00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:04.082
bunch of new live content coming to our Critical
Role Twitch stream in the next few weeks,

00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:06.560
including the season finale of All Work No Play.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.623
SAM: That's tomorrow.

00:06:07.623 --> 00:06:09.177
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

00:06:09.177 --> 00:06:11.612
MATT: Yeah. I've seen clips and I'm already pretty
excited.

00:06:11.612 --> 00:06:14.023
LIAM: Very, very, very special.

00:06:14.023 --> 00:06:20.112
MARISHA: I've been doing this a while. It might be
the weirdest thing I've produced. It's frickin

00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:22.620
weird. Yeah, whole thing's bizarre.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.161
MATT: There's also an all-honey Honey Heist coming
up.

00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:27.362
(cheering)

00:06:27.362 --> 00:06:29.667
MATT: All-honey Honey Heist.

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:32.879
SAM: Is it all honey plus Brian Foster, or just
all honeys?

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.261
MARISHA: Nope, just all honeys.

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:35.083
SAM: Awesome.

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:36.069
MARISHA: All the ladies.

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:36.996
TRAVIS: Honey Heist! Honey, Honey Heist!

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:43.432
MARISHA: Laura, of course, some old friends: Mary
Elizabeth and Noelle Stevenson

00:06:43.432 --> 00:06:44.935
SAM: Ooh!

00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:46.994
MARISHA: Some classics, yeah.

00:06:46.994 --> 00:06:49.223
LIAM: That's some heavy She-Ra juice.

00:06:49.223 --> 00:06:52.611
TRAVIS: So much power at one table. Wow!

00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:58.703
MARISHA: As well as the lovely Dani Carr that we
all know and love. The lovely Brittany Walloch

00:06:58.703 --> 00:07:01.807
from All Work No Play fame.

00:07:01.807 --> 00:07:04.274
SAM: I've heard of them.

00:07:04.274 --> 00:07:06.663
MARISHA: Who else am I missing, huh?

00:07:06.663 --> 00:07:07.747
MATT: Isn't Krystina playing?

00:07:07.747 --> 00:07:10.271
MARISHA: Oh and Krystina Arielle from Sirens of
the Realms.

00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:11.425
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah!

00:07:11.425 --> 00:07:12.876
MARISHA: Full house.

00:07:12.876 --> 00:07:17.947
MATT: Going to be a lot of fun, so check it out.
We also have Sam's Pablove fireside chat coming up

00:07:17.947 --> 00:07:18.636
soon.

00:07:18.636 --> 00:07:20.743
SAM: Oh that's right, I have to do a fireside
chat.

00:07:20.743 --> 00:07:21.871
MATT: Yeah, you do.

00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:23.225
TRAVIS: Are you doing that in a speedo, or what?

00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:24.648
LIAM: No, he promised to free-ball it.

00:07:24.648 --> 00:07:28.301
TRAVIS: What? Amazing!

00:07:28.301 --> 00:07:30.971
SAM: Okay. Uh-huh.

00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:37.055
MATT: And much more. Go to critrole.com for
details of all these fantastic shows that are

00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:43.704
coming up in the next couple of weeks. We'll have
more updates as far as our content schedule as it

00:07:43.704 --> 00:07:48.295
comes. Also, our second art book, as you
mentioned, Chronicles of Exandria Volume II:

00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:54.335
Legend of the Vox Machina is available for
pre-order at the shop at shop.critrole.com and

00:07:54.335 --> 00:08:02.710
shop.critrole.co.uk for our UK and surrounding
European brethren. An important note, if you do

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.064
not reside in the UK or the US: you may want to
check both stores to see which is most cost

00:08:07.064 --> 00:08:14.446
effective to ship from. It just happens to be
wibbly-wobbly shipping stuff. Huge thanks to all

00:08:14.446 --> 00:08:18.062
of you for your fantastic support, for all the
fantastic artists, and the fantastic community.

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:23.157
This is a big love letter to the end of last
campaign, and each of you having something really

00:08:23.157 --> 00:08:29.265
special to come to make this a memorable keepsake
for all of us. So thank you. As a reminder, there

00:08:29.265 --> 00:08:32.928
will not be an episode of Critical Role next week
because it's Thursday November 22nd, which is

00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:34.879
Thanksgiving here in the US.

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:36.897
TRAVIS: Going to eat food!

00:08:36.897 --> 00:08:41.563
MATT: Yep, I know. We will be enjoying time off
with our family and friends, but we will be

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:45.348
thinking of you guys in the meantime and we will
be back the week after that. So there'll be a one

00:08:45.348 --> 00:08:49.662
week break, we'll see you in two weeks after
tonight's episode. I believe those are all--

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:51.164
LAURA: I got something!

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:53.316
MATT: Oh! Sneaky Laura!

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:58.374
LAURA: No, it's not on the thing, but I have it
anyway. Are you wearing it?

00:08:58.374 --> 00:08:59.860
MARISHA: Yes, I am!

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.973
LAURA: We have our hoodies, back in stock in
shop.critrole.com. It's new and improved. Yeah,

00:09:05.973 --> 00:09:12.803
2.0. This really awesome text was hand
calligraphed? Calli-- how do you say it?

00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:14.362
TALIESIN: Calligraphed.

00:09:14.362 --> 00:09:18.245
LAURA: Did I say it right? By Chris Gladis and
then we turned it into this graphic, and so it's

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:19.744
really gorgeous.

00:09:19.744 --> 00:09:21.268
MATT: Critter calligraphed.

00:09:21.268 --> 00:09:22.700
LAURA: Yes! And it's super soft still.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.078
MARISHA: It's so nice!

00:09:24.078 --> 00:09:27.528
LAURA: Then the other thing that's in the store
now that we didn't tell you guys about ahead of

00:09:27.528 --> 00:09:34.996
time is something I'm very excited about. We have
baby onesies! There's not a ton of them because

00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:37.006
how many Critter babies are there?

00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:38.994
TRAVIS: Thousands!

00:09:38.994 --> 00:09:41.691
LAURA: I designed this one, it says, "I wanna be a
monstah!"

00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:43.837
MARISHA: Look at the little rattle mace!

00:09:43.837 --> 00:09:45.802
LAURA: It's got a mace rattle!

00:09:45.802 --> 00:09:51.584
MATT: Also viable for our really small critters,
too. I think Sam will fit in one.

00:09:51.584 --> 00:09:53.834
TRAVIS: We will certainly try.

00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:55.991
MATT: In fact for the fireside chat we could--

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:58.888
SAM: Oh, maybe I can just wear that. That's a good
idea.

00:09:58.888 --> 00:10:06.281
MATT: Well, thank you, Laura. With that, my
friends, I think tonight, it's time to dive into

00:10:06.281 --> 00:10:09.727
our episode of Critical Role.

00:10:09.727 --> 00:10:16.043
[TV static, click]

00:10:16.043 --> 00:11:33.225
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:11:33.745 --> 00:11:43.479
MATT: And welcome back. Wow. You guys are ever
creative. Last we left off. The Mighty Nein--

00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:44.916
Garbage wine?

00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:46.452
LIAM: Garbage wine.

00:11:46.452 --> 00:11:47.395
SAM: Water.

00:11:47.395 --> 00:11:55.085
MATT: The Mighty Nein had made their way to the
Menagerie Coast, got swept up in a bunch of chaos,

00:11:55.357 --> 00:12:01.793
and found themselves out at sea, amongst the
Swavain Islands, taken in by a pirate crew,

00:12:01.793 --> 00:12:10.738
captained by Captain Avantika, basically at threat
of death otherwise. Sent to an island to

00:12:10.738 --> 00:12:18.890
investigate a temple, learn about seals that
possibly are keeping your patron, Uk'otoa, at bay.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:29.288
Made your way back across the Lucidian Ocean,
towards the city of Darktow. Actually actively

00:12:29.288 --> 00:12:30.855
partook in some piracy.

00:12:30.855 --> 00:12:31.693
SAM: Yeah.

00:12:31.693 --> 00:12:33.483
TRAVIS: Polite piracy

00:12:33.483 --> 00:12:35.825
MATT: Polite piracy. Sure.

00:12:35.825 --> 00:12:38.036
TALIESIN: You got a participant trophy.

00:12:38.036 --> 00:12:45.317
MATT: Whatever it takes to help you sleep at
night. And found yourselves at the pirate city of

00:12:45.317 --> 00:12:52.700
Darktow, surrounded by the Dragshallow Reef. Where
you had just arrived, with both ships, the

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:59.502
Squalleater and The Mistake. The crew you had
hired out of Nicodranas, looking very confused and

00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:06.122
concerned at their current fate, given the fact
they were just hired hands at sea. You were

00:13:06.122 --> 00:13:12.390
ushered up along the sheer cliffs alongside
Darktow Isle, a long stone shelf within the cavern

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:22.014
where the Plank King himself greeted you, bid you
entry to the Revelry, this extending band of

00:13:22.014 --> 00:13:30.147
pirates across this part of the ocean. Laid some
ground rules and sent you on your way. And that is

00:13:30.147 --> 00:13:38.139
where we left off. Mighty Nein, as you descend the
rain-covered stone steps that descend down the

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:42.867
side of the cliffs-- how's that for alliteration
in a phrase? Making your way towards the

00:13:42.867 --> 00:13:51.699
now-darkened evening city of Darktow, the distant
glimmers of interior firelight slightly emanating

00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:57.211
from open windows. You can see folks walking
through town, the light drizzle threatening to

00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:03.853
stifle the low torchlight being carried from
location to location. You can see the outline of

00:14:03.853 --> 00:14:10.298
dozens of ships that are locked into the shipyard
that surrounds the city, as well as the crooked

00:14:10.298 --> 00:14:17.990
outline of nearby barricades set up across the
reefs that surround the island. Avantika proceeds

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.911
before you. What would you like to do?

00:14:20.911 --> 00:14:24.242
SAM: (whispers) Shoot her in the back of the
head.

00:14:24.242 --> 00:14:29.803
LAURA: (whispers) We could totally push her off
the cliff right now.

00:14:29.803 --> 00:14:30.536
SAM: Oh!

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.072
MARISHA: (whispers) Uk'otoa.

00:14:32.072 --> 00:14:34.655
TRAVIS: Yeah, so, the group is us plus Avantika
and--

00:14:34.655 --> 00:14:35.713
MARISHA: Her crew?

00:14:35.713 --> 00:14:40.016
MATT: No, just Avantika. Her crew went to The
Bloated Cup, which is a tavern.

00:14:40.016 --> 00:14:41.335
MARISHA: And we're headed there.

00:14:41.335 --> 00:14:43.550
MATT: Correct. You assume you're headed back
there.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.704
LIAM: Pirate on pirate violence is verboten.

00:14:46.704 --> 00:14:48.472
LAURA: She just slipped.

00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:49.736
LIAM: That's true.

00:14:49.736 --> 00:14:50.613
SAM: I saw it.

00:14:50.613 --> 00:14:53.199
MARISHA: She fell down the stairs, you guys.

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:54.624
TRAVIS: Night time, right? Sun has gone down?

00:14:54.624 --> 00:14:55.396
MATT: Correct.

00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:56.045
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:14:56.045 --> 00:14:58.698
MARISHA: I catch up to her a little bit. Hey,
Avantika.

00:14:58.698 --> 00:14:59.553
MATT: "Yes?"

00:14:59.553 --> 00:15:01.139
MARISHA: Weird question.

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:03.059
MATT: "Possibly a weird answer."

00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:10.212
MARISHA: How much do you know-- How do you know
how to give a certain amount to Avantika? Sorry,

00:15:10.212 --> 00:15:12.926
the Plank King. Freudian slip.

00:15:12.926 --> 00:15:24.049
MATT: "Well, when we return into the bay, we are
to essentially give the materials, or at least a

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:30.170
"number of what we've managed to acquire. We are
supposed to, essentially-- what is the word I'm

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.961
"looking for? What is the word I'm looking for?"

00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:36.041
SAM: Tithe?

00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:42.937
MATT: Tithe, I would say-- You're going through
customs and you have to--

00:15:42.937 --> 00:15:44.430
ALL: Declare.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:50.489
MATT: Declare, thank you. "You must declare the
amount of which you have recently come upon, and

00:15:50.489 --> 00:16:00.052
"from that there is a tithe offer to the Plank
King, roughly about 25-30%. But we do not pay for

00:16:00.052 --> 00:16:07.887
"our ship repairs, we have free asylum here within
the island, and we are under the strict law that

00:16:07.887 --> 00:16:13.234
"if anyone double-crosses anyone else within the
bounds of the city, they will have the hammer of

00:16:13.234 --> 00:16:15.713
"the Plank King down upon them."

00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:17.209
MARISHA: It's very intense.

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:19.121
MATT: "That is the way of life."

00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:23.747
MARISHA: So it's less like a government and more
of a union that you buy into?

00:16:23.747 --> 00:16:27.722
MATT: "More or less, yes. They're not much into
governing, more just--"

00:16:27.722 --> 00:16:29.765
MARISHA: Like a union with a dictator?

00:16:29.765 --> 00:16:35.043
MATT: "A union with a very hard-headed and
forthright union leader."

00:16:35.043 --> 00:16:40.981
MARISHA: "Hmm. Do you ever think you could make a
good union leader?"

00:16:40.981 --> 00:16:44.459
MATT: "Nah. I have my own specific interests,
they're much more narrow."

00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:47.266
MARISHA: Huh.

00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:51.150
MATT: "Why, do you have aspirations?"

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.279
MARISHA: No.

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:54.042
MATT: "I didn't think so."

00:16:54.042 --> 00:16:56.306
MARISHA: Who needs aspirations?

00:16:56.306 --> 00:17:01.989
MATT: "Well, some of us do. There has to be more
to you than just this

00:17:01.989 --> 00:17:07.320
"contradictory-for-the-sake-of-being-contradictory
aspect, eh?"

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.944
MARISHA: I would love for you to tell me about it
someday.

00:17:09.944 --> 00:17:15.401
MATT: "Come, let's have a drink, huh? First
round's on me."

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:16.352
MARISHA: Deal.

00:17:16.352 --> 00:17:19.848
SAM: (singing) Everyone's fucking Avantika!

00:17:19.848 --> 00:17:29.646
LIAM: You are going to judge me for finger
motions? Hold on, everybody, stop the game. Laura

00:17:29.646 --> 00:17:36.774
Bailey just shamed me for a sexual finger motion,
at this table, after three and a half

00:17:36.774 --> 00:17:43.613
motherfucking years! I have seen everything!
Resume the game.

00:17:43.613 --> 00:17:48.050
TRAVIS: Avantika is the Infinity Gauntlet and she
has one stone.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.873
(laughter)

00:17:51.873 --> 00:17:53.151
TRAVIS: Or does she?

00:17:53.151 --> 00:17:55.535
MATT: Well, she lost a stone, technically.

00:17:55.535 --> 00:18:04.663
TALIESIN: Well. We should take a look around,
maybe get a sense of this place, since we're going

00:18:04.663 --> 00:18:09.004
to be here for a while when they fix the ship. I
have a few things I'm looking for.

00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:10.862
MARISHA: Might as well go to the pub.

00:18:10.862 --> 00:18:15.650
TALIESIN: We could do that, sure, I guess.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.898
MARISHA: First drink's on her.

00:18:17.898 --> 00:18:21.737
LAURA: I think that guy was wearing a wig.

00:18:21.737 --> 00:18:30.005
SAM: Oh yes, he did have a weird hairline, right?

00:18:30.005 --> 00:18:34.564
LAURA: Yeah, it was a really bad-made wig. I mean,
the hair looked good, but it was really obvious.

00:18:34.564 --> 00:18:37.751
SAM: Maybe that's in fashion here, maybe we should
all go wig shopping.

00:18:37.751 --> 00:18:39.042
LAURA: Ooh!

00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:40.730
SAM: Just saying.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:48.853
TRAVIS: Captain, how did the current Plank King
get to the position that he holds now, do you know?

00:18:49.314 --> 00:18:56.012
MATT: "As far as I have been told, at the very
least-- this was before my time joining the

00:18:56.012 --> 00:19:04.782
"Revelry-- there was a disagreement, and the
previous Plank King seemed to be in the minority

00:19:04.782 --> 00:19:13.034
"of the side of this disagreement, and the current
Plank King was in the majority. So they stormed

00:19:13.034 --> 00:19:20.383
"the caverns of the previous Plank King, and tossed
most of his corpse to the rocks below."

00:19:20.383 --> 00:19:31.050
TRAVIS: A little mutiny, eh? Did-- Hmm.
Interesting. No, that's all.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:35.381
MATT: "To his credit, the current Plank King has
done a very fine job of maintaining organization

00:19:35.381 --> 00:19:36.807
"in the Revelry."

00:19:36.807 --> 00:19:39.145
TRAVIS: That's what I was going to ask: if you
were a fan or not.

00:19:39.145 --> 00:19:43.801
MATT: "He doesn't bother me, he leaves us well
enough alone, we follow the rules, we maintain

00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:50.465
"all of the benefits of being under the banner, and
I'm left to my own devices."

00:19:50.465 --> 00:19:55.533
TRAVIS: Any foes of yours in this Darktow? Anyone
we should look out for?

00:19:55.533 --> 00:20:04.489
MATT: "There are a number of unsavory types, but
I've made a bit of a reputation of being a

00:20:04.489 --> 00:20:11.107
"little-- eh? People don't like to tangle with that
too much, eh?"

00:20:11.107 --> 00:20:16.860
TRAVIS: Yeah, why would you get wrapped up in
that? Yeah, let's go grab a drink.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.426
MARISHA and SAM: Mm-hmm.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.743
LAURA: How long have you been a pirate?

00:20:20.743 --> 00:20:26.556
MATT: "Let's see. Open on the seas? About 12, 13
years."

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:28.094
LAURA: Whoa!

00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:29.913
LIAM: How did you fall into it?

00:20:29.913 --> 00:20:35.849
MATT: "I got sick of following somebody else's
orders."

00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:39.434
LIAM: Where do you hail from?

00:20:39.434 --> 00:20:46.154
MATT: "I'll tell you over drinks. This is not the
best place to have these discussions, eh? Perhaps

00:20:46.154 --> 00:20:49.833
"after a few rounds. Come! To The Bloated Cup!"

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:52.455
SAM: The Bloated Cup.

00:20:52.455 --> 00:20:54.198
TRAVIS: Yep. We go.

00:20:54.198 --> 00:21:00.542
MATT: As you guys finish descending the stairs
into the city itself, you catch there are quite a

00:21:00.729 --> 00:21:04.259
few patrols through the city. You can see the
torchlight being held by each as they make their

00:21:04.259 --> 00:21:09.754
way, just keeping an eye out. You get the sense
that there's probably quite a number of

00:21:09.754 --> 00:21:15.747
volunteers, or at least individuals, that are
intent on maintaining the semblance of civility

00:21:15.747 --> 00:21:22.035
here within Darktow itself. Leading close towards
The Bloated Cup, it's not that far from where you

00:21:22.035 --> 00:21:28.801
had set your ship within the shipyard. It's a
fairly large two-story tavern, very wide across

00:21:28.801 --> 00:21:37.364
its bottom, and seems to be at least one of maybe
two social gathering sites here within the city,

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:44.621
once the sun goes down. Three blocks away, you can
already hear the music, chatter, laughter, and

00:21:44.621 --> 00:21:50.727
yelling. As you approach closer, begin to look
from the outside in, the warm light and the

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:56.399
movement of shadows across the open windows shows
you that the place is pretty jam-packed. As you

00:21:56.399 --> 00:22:01.360
begin to make your way into, following Avantika,
to the interior, you hear the shouting and

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:09.528
burbling and clinking of glasses as the far corner
has five or six individuals. You're not sure if

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:15.624
they're paid musicians, or just sailors who happen
to have a bit of experience with a fiddle, a drum,

00:22:15.624 --> 00:22:21.358
and a flute of some kind. As the music begins to
play, you can see there is one table that has a

00:22:21.358 --> 00:22:27.356
lot of Avantika's crew. They've pushed a bunch of
chairs clammed together-- clammed?-- crammed

00:22:27.356 --> 00:22:38.405
together with some bits of dried bread and
somewhat soft fruit, some cheeses laid out, and

00:22:38.405 --> 00:22:44.216
two large pitchers of ale already waiting at the
get-go. Right off from them, you see a smaller

00:22:44.216 --> 00:22:50.472
table with everyone you've hired from The Mistake,
including Orly, all sitting there clutching their

00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:55.863
glasses looking around scared shitless. As soon as
you enter, their eyes turn to you and they go--

00:22:55.863 --> 00:22:58.663
(laughter)

00:22:58.663 --> 00:23:04.396
TRAVIS: They do that cafeteria thing, "Hey! Hey,
you want to sit? Over here?"

00:23:04.396 --> 00:23:08.236
MATT: At which point Avantika goes, "Come! Have a
seat!" and pushes one of the other tables out of

00:23:08.236 --> 00:23:13.197
the way of a few other people that are already
sitting at it. She takes her hand and scoots it

00:23:13.197 --> 00:23:19.028
across the table and they both go, (annoyed
grunt), and spit on the ground and get up and move

00:23:19.028 --> 00:23:23.959
away. Immediately you get the sense that there is
a power dynamic. Avantika seems to have at least

00:23:23.959 --> 00:23:27.887
some modicum of respect amongst the rest of the
riff-raff within this tavern.

00:23:27.887 --> 00:23:29.176
TALIESIN: She's a Heather.

00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:31.504
MARISHA: (knowing laugh)

00:23:31.504 --> 00:23:36.008
MATT: Pushing the tables together, kicking a
couple of the stools over, it looks like there's

00:23:36.339 --> 00:23:39.338
enough spots at the table for most of you. One or
two of you might have to stand or find a place

00:23:39.338 --> 00:23:41.826
next to the rest of your hired help.

00:23:41.826 --> 00:23:42.853
TALIESIN: I'll stand.

00:23:42.853 --> 00:23:44.294
LAURA: I'll stand, too.

00:23:44.294 --> 00:23:50.657
MATT: As you guys all sit down, drinks and rounds
begin to be passed to each of you, conversations

00:23:50.657 --> 00:23:57.349
already mid-discussing. You hear bits and pieces
about how, "the blessing of the Serpent has been

00:23:57.349 --> 00:24:01.955
"upon us this past month." Being on the ship with
most of the crew, they haven't been terribly

00:24:01.955 --> 00:24:06.733
social with you. They've helped you and guided you
in learning a few things, but there's still very

00:24:06.733 --> 00:24:10.738
much this separation and attention that you're the
newcomers, and a strange, new shiny thing in their

00:24:10.738 --> 00:24:14.825
captain's eye. This is the first time you've seen
them a little bit three sheets to the wind as a

00:24:14.825 --> 00:24:22.415
group, and they're talking openly. Avantika has a
definite zealotry to her, but you start noticing

00:24:22.415 --> 00:24:27.266
members of the crew and why they are with her or,
at least, now that they've been there, they've

00:24:27.266 --> 00:24:36.597
also bought into these tales of Uk'otoa. You get
the sense that they believe that this path that

00:24:36.597 --> 00:24:41.921
she's following will lead to her success and, by
default, probably their success.

00:24:41.921 --> 00:24:46.001
TALIESIN: How many of them are true believers?
Give or take?

00:24:46.001 --> 00:24:48.022
MATT: Make an insight check for me.

00:24:48.022 --> 00:24:49.853
TRAVIS: You're no good at those, right?

00:24:49.853 --> 00:24:51.891
TALIESIN: I'm terrible at these.

00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:54.369
TRAVIS: I want to know what blood type they are.

00:24:54.369 --> 00:24:55.677
TALIESIN: 26

00:24:55.677 --> 00:25:06.903
MATT: Okay, that'll do. That'll, yeah. Okay. You
get the sense that Vera, who's the older human,

00:25:06.903 --> 00:25:14.213
the tough-looking woman who was her quartermaster
before it was passed to Fjord, is definitely the

00:25:14.213 --> 00:25:23.427
most invested in this idea, this spiritual journey
they're all embarking on with captain at the helm.

00:25:23.427 --> 00:25:31.487
You also feel that Ipess, who's the gnome second
mate that you've encountered previously, in a very

00:25:31.487 --> 00:25:37.569
similar way is completely invested, eyes wide. His
general banter tends to be a little crazed and

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:46.669
sporadic, but whenever they're talking about the
Great Serpent, now with phrasing of "The Leviathan"

00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:51.647
as the title has become more prominent with
discovery, there's a reverence to his eyes and an

00:25:51.647 --> 00:25:59.677
attentiveness that is out of character for him. So
you mark Vera and Ipess as two very intent

00:25:59.677 --> 00:26:02.277
believers, behind Avantika.

00:26:02.277 --> 00:26:07.450
TALIESIN: Is there anybody who's awkwardly into
it, but definitely would probably walk away if

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.450
they could? Is there anybody who's a little--

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:13.702
MATT: You get the sense that Bouldergut, the ogre,
half-understands it and is more just excited

00:26:13.702 --> 00:26:18.126
because everyone else is excited. It's like a dog
that gets really wound up when everyone around is

00:26:18.126 --> 00:26:25.454
talking loud. That's Bouldergut. A number of the
deckhands appear to be invested, but they're less

00:26:25.454 --> 00:26:33.611
intensely driven and more just excited that their
captain's excited and maybe starting to consider

00:26:33.611 --> 00:26:37.390
that there is something to this now that they've
seen the things they've seen, and the powers that

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:41.946
she's acquired. That's a good spread of what
you've managed to gather.

00:26:41.946 --> 00:26:43.571
TALIESIN: That'll do.

00:26:43.571 --> 00:26:48.026
TRAVIS: I'll grab a drink and I'll head over to
where Vera's sitting.

00:26:48.026 --> 00:26:53.141
MATT: Okay. Vera is sitting directly to the right
of Avantika, and there's not much space to sit

00:26:53.141 --> 00:26:57.164
next to her, but you could grab a stool and
squeeze in to her right side.

00:26:57.164 --> 00:27:01.684
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take a drink and I'll plop it
down right in front of her and I'll take a knee on

00:27:01.684 --> 00:27:08.891
the floor, so I'm kneeling next to her on the
other side of Avantika. I'll say: Hey listen, no

00:27:08.891 --> 00:27:10.989
hard feelings, right?

00:27:10.989 --> 00:27:21.140
MATT: "There is no hard feelings. I understand the
reasoning, and the captain's word is law. I am

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:28.790
"excited to see the great things you accomplish as
the quartermaster of our ship."

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.190
TRAVIS: Right, whatever's best for the ship.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.814
MATT: "Precisely, and for the captain."

00:27:33.814 --> 00:27:40.744
TRAVIS: Well, I feel the presence of Uk'otoa
smiling on all of us and I know that our

00:27:40.744 --> 00:27:44.834
partnership here will be a beneficial one.

00:27:44.834 --> 00:27:47.917
MATT: "I can only agree."

00:27:47.917 --> 00:27:56.526
TRAVIS: Well, this has been fun. If you need
anything, as your quartermaster, you just let me know.

00:27:58.778 --> 00:28:07.713
MATT: "Aye aye. Captain." Looks to Avantika.
Avantika right now is deep in the cups. At this

00:28:07.713 --> 00:28:14.068
point, a figure turns around the corner. You see a
male gnome: short, maybe in his 40s or so with

00:28:14.068 --> 00:28:20.529
spiked hair. It's thinning on the top, but you can
see he's taken thick balms of some kind to try and

00:28:20.529 --> 00:28:25.795
make it look intensely young, and failing halfway.
Big mutton chops that come down to a very pointed

00:28:25.795 --> 00:28:33.800
chin, and he's dressed in fairly decent clothing,
a nice silk vest with billowing sleeves out of his

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.826
shirt, with some bangles that clink around his
wrists. He comes and finds you on the opposite

00:28:39.826 --> 00:28:48.175
side and looks across to Avantika grinning. He
goes, "Well well well, it's been a while since

00:28:48.175 --> 00:28:54.432
"we've seen you 'round here!" She turns to him and
goes, "Ah, Sorris! You're back from that fool's

00:28:54.432 --> 00:29:02.114
"errand, I see. How was the Shattered Teeth?" He
goes, "Eh, foggy and cold as shit. How goes your

00:29:02.114 --> 00:29:11.364
"cloud-chasing journeys, love?" She goes, "Grand!
We might have scored a fine shipwreck, and a

00:29:11.364 --> 00:29:19.016
"promise of salvage, eh?" Looks back to him. "You
up for hire, perhaps?" He goes, "Eh, tempting but,

00:29:19.016 --> 00:29:25.252
"nah. I'm still fresh off the water, want to enjoy
myself a while." She's like, "All right, very

00:29:25.252 --> 00:29:30.213
"well, we'll be in port for a day or two while we
get some repairs done. If you change your mind,

00:29:30.213 --> 00:29:35.145
"well, just start shouting. I'm sure we'll find
your annoying voice easy enough." He goes,

00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:40.475
"(giggles) Sure that is, eh? You're all new 'round
here."

00:29:40.475 --> 00:29:42.140
LAURA: Arr!

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:47.654
SAM: Yeah, we're new pirates. Are you a pirate? I
mean, I guess we're all pirates, right? Everyone's

00:29:47.654 --> 00:29:48.933
a pirate here?

00:29:48.933 --> 00:29:51.730
MATT: "At the moment, no. At the moment I'm a
civilian, and a drunkard."

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.532
SAM: Oh!

00:29:52.532 --> 00:29:56.585
TALIESIN: Shattered Teeth, what's the Shattered
Teeth? Did your teeth shatter? Is that a place?

00:29:56.585 --> 00:29:59.765
MATT: "No, it's a series of islands to the south
of here."

00:29:59.765 --> 00:30:00.610
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.274
LAURA: We know that because we're pirates too, and
we know those things.

00:30:04.274 --> 00:30:06.648
TALIESIN: I could fill a book with what I don't
know.

00:30:06.648 --> 00:30:09.194
TRAVIS: Sorry, I didn't catch your name, it
was--?

00:30:09.194 --> 00:30:13.329
MATT: "Sorris. Sorris Kay. What's your name?"

00:30:13.329 --> 00:30:15.925
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm Fjord. Nice to meet you.

00:30:15.925 --> 00:30:18.561
MATT: "Fjord? All right."

00:30:18.561 --> 00:30:24.203
SAM: Are you a captain, or do you do something
else that's more specialized?

00:30:24.203 --> 00:30:26.420
MATT: "Me? No, I'm a sniper."

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.968
SAM: A sniper?

00:30:27.968 --> 00:30:30.131
LIAM: What do you snipe with?

00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:32.984
MATT: "Things. Why are you so curious?"

00:30:32.984 --> 00:30:35.142
LIAM: You're an interesting fellow.

00:30:35.142 --> 00:30:37.476
MATT: "Speak for yourself, sir. What's your
name?"

00:30:37.476 --> 00:30:40.251
LIAM: My name is Phillip.

00:30:40.251 --> 00:30:42.822
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:30:42.822 --> 00:30:44.574
SAM: Name check!

00:30:44.574 --> 00:30:46.723
TRAVIS: Strong name.

00:30:46.723 --> 00:30:52.529
LIAM: What is that? I don't have my contacts in. I
can barely see it. That's 11, right? So that is 17.

00:30:53.115 --> 00:30:57.795
MATT: He goes, "Okay, Phillip, and what's your
specialty? What do you bring to the crew?"

00:30:57.795 --> 00:31:05.434
LIAM: Oh, I am a navigator. Newer, but eager and
looking forward to plying my trade.

00:31:05.434 --> 00:31:07.293
SAM: Quick, Phillip, which way's north?

00:31:07.293 --> 00:31:09.294
LIAM: It's right that way.

00:31:09.294 --> 00:31:10.338
SAM: That's amazing!

00:31:10.338 --> 00:31:12.123
MATT: "That's actually pretty good!"

00:31:12.123 --> 00:31:17.413
SAM: You can spin him. Here! I'm going to spin him
around a couple times. Now which way's north?

00:31:17.413 --> 00:31:19.347
LIAM: It's still over toward the hallway over
there.

00:31:19.347 --> 00:31:20.998
SAM: Wow, right?

00:31:20.998 --> 00:31:28.797
MATT: "That's pretty good. Me, I've got a few odds
and things, mainly with a longbow. Good shot

00:31:28.797 --> 00:31:32.554
"there, but an eye that can see things on the
horizon, mainly live up in the crow's nest, you

00:31:32.554 --> 00:31:34.721
"know? Keep an eye out."

00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:39.238
LIAM: You know, this is our first time on these
islands and I don't know much about it at all. Is

00:31:39.238 --> 00:31:47.086
there any legal system here? Do you know what I
mean? Or is it just, you know-- (gunshots)

00:31:47.086 --> 00:31:55.766
MATT: "He's joking, right?" Avantika goes, "I'm
afraid not. His bailiwick, apparently, is being

00:31:55.766 --> 00:31:57.766
"curious and clueless."

00:31:57.766 --> 00:32:04.812
LIAM: I am a big reader and there is a lot I don't
know, like my tall friend over here. I mean, there

00:32:04.812 --> 00:32:08.254
must be trouble that breaks out. There must be bar
fights.

00:32:08.254 --> 00:32:11.828
MATT: "Of course, bar fights are fun. That's part
of the reason we live here!"

00:32:11.828 --> 00:32:16.854
LIAM: Well, I can see the appeal, but what happens
if there's something risky or it causes theft of

00:32:16.854 --> 00:32:18.941
property for someone important?

00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:22.222
MATT: "If it's a member of the Revelry thieving
from another member of the Revelry, and it gets

00:32:22.222 --> 00:32:27.204
found out, it's brought to Plank King. Plank King
makes a judgment, based on that, some sort of

00:32:27.204 --> 00:32:30.388
reparations or-- (thud, screaming, impacts)"

00:32:30.388 --> 00:32:33.964
LIAM: So Plank King is the law?

00:32:33.964 --> 00:32:35.396
MATT: "More or less."

00:32:35.396 --> 00:32:37.045
LIAM: That's biblical.

00:32:37.045 --> 00:32:40.240
LAURA: But you can still fight other people? For
fun?

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.693
MATT: "Why? You looking for a fight?"

00:32:42.693 --> 00:32:44.494
LAURA: Are you looking for a fight?

00:32:44.494 --> 00:32:45.711
MATT: "Always."

00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:46.981
SAM: Don't fight each other!

00:32:46.981 --> 00:32:47.836
LAURA: Why?

00:32:47.836 --> 00:32:49.668
SAM: Because that's crazy.

00:32:49.668 --> 00:32:54.593
MATT: "I never throw the first punch, so anytime."
He taps the side of one of his jowls. You hear the

00:32:54.593 --> 00:33:00.866
ruffle of his fingers through his somewhat curled
muttonchop on the side.

00:33:00.866 --> 00:33:01.971
MARISHA: Do it!

00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:05.121
MATT: Grabs a drink and without breaking eye
contact--

00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:06.955
TRAVIS: We just got here.

00:33:06.955 --> 00:33:08.656
SAM: Why? Why would you do this?

00:33:08.656 --> 00:33:11.699
MARISHA: I'm the worst influence. I'm going to say
do it.

00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:14.362
LIAM: We are trying to get the lay of the land
here.

00:33:17.092 --> 00:33:19.062
LAURA: Tusktooth?

00:33:19.062 --> 00:33:23.895
TRAVIS: (gulping)

00:33:25.235 --> 00:33:27.454
LAURA: I punch him in the chin!

00:33:27.454 --> 00:33:30.301
MATT: Roll an attack.

00:33:30.301 --> 00:33:33.857
TALIESIN: You didn't even ask him if there's a
bookshop nearby.

00:33:34.577 --> 00:33:37.414
LIAM: Might have gotten to that, perhaps.

00:33:37.414 --> 00:33:43.609
LAURA: Unarmed strike! 14? No, 15.

00:33:43.609 --> 00:33:47.704
MATT: 15 hits. You do one point of damage plus
your strength modifier.

00:33:47.704 --> 00:33:51.629
LAURA: Four points of damage!

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:59.039
MATT: Boom, right across his chin. He falls to the
ground, turns around, rubs his chin. "That was a

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:04.691
surprising bit of power there for someone your
size. Come at me!" He dives at you. Roll initiative.

00:34:04.727 --> 00:34:06.778
MARISHA: Yes!

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:08.744
LAURA: 16.

00:34:08.744 --> 00:34:17.966
MATT: Oh, he beats you at a 17. 15 plus two. For a
small size, he is quick and he jukes to one side,

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:25.464
turns around, and goes for a haymaker to the side
of your face! That's cocked. That's a 14 to hit.

00:34:25.464 --> 00:34:27.606
LAURA: Oh, I turn and he hits my shield.

00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:29.799
MATT: Ping! "Ah!"

00:34:29.799 --> 00:34:32.760
LAURA: I swipe at him with my tail and try to trip
him.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.046
MATT: Go for it. Make another attack roll.

00:34:35.046 --> 00:34:40.121
LAURA: 19!

00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:44.372
MATT: Are you just doing damage or are you trying
to shove him and knock him prone?

00:34:44.372 --> 00:34:46.060
LAURA: Just knock him prone.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.562
MATT: Okay, that's your athletics check,
actually.

00:34:48.562 --> 00:34:51.429
LAURA: Oh, okay, so I would add 13 plus
athletics.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.836
MATT: He's going to make his acrobatics to try and
dodge.

00:34:52.836 --> 00:34:53.969
LAURA: 16.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:58.873
MATT: Natural 19. He manages to leap in the air
and your tail hits the side of the table and

00:34:58.873 --> 00:35:02.749
(thudding) to one side. The drinks begin to spill
and one reaches out and grabs them, prevents them

00:35:02.749 --> 00:35:04.118
from being knocked over.

00:35:04.118 --> 00:35:05.532
TRAVIS: We're all grabbing our drinks and standing
up.

00:35:05.532 --> 00:35:06.445
LAURA: Wow, you're quick!

00:35:06.445 --> 00:35:09.937
MATT: As soon as you turn back and say that, you
look and he's not anywhere to be seen. Then you

00:35:09.937 --> 00:35:13.966
hear this (footsteps) under the table. You glance
down as you watch him leaping up from between your

00:35:13.966 --> 00:35:19.545
legs and the table to uppercut you right in the
chin. That's 18 to hit.

00:35:19.545 --> 00:35:20.705
LAURA: I'm 18.

00:35:20.705 --> 00:35:26.101
MATT: He just manages to hit you! You take three
points of damage. Crack! Right from underneath the

00:35:26.101 --> 00:35:33.213
chin, you feel your jaw clink into your teeth,
there's a horrible screeching sound. It hurts. You

00:35:33.213 --> 00:35:37.677
can feel the numbness in your face from the
impact. After he hits you, he darts off around

00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:41.065
from behind and he's probably going to go in for a
hold, but you have your go.

00:35:41.065 --> 00:35:45.976
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to reach out and try to
punch him in the back of the head.

00:35:45.976 --> 00:35:47.416
MATT: Go for it.

00:35:47.416 --> 00:35:49.022
SAM: Inelegant, but perfect.

00:35:49.022 --> 00:35:51.028
LAURA: Oh no. Natural one.

00:35:51.028 --> 00:35:58.034
MATT: You go to swing for his head and he grabs
your hand and goes, "Ah-ah-ah." He goes to pull

00:35:58.034 --> 00:35:59.940
you forward to go for a headbutt.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.546
MATT: That's a 19 to hit!

00:36:02.546 --> 00:36:03.846
LAURA: Fuck me.

00:36:03.846 --> 00:36:08.868
MATT: Crack! Right in the front of the forehead
and the nose, you can immediately feel the blood

00:36:08.868 --> 00:36:10.457
beginning to pour from underneath.

00:36:10.457 --> 00:36:11.843
SAM: Crikey.

00:36:11.843 --> 00:36:16.154
MATT: Behind, you guys watch the crowd. A lot of
people's attention have turned to this bar fight.

00:36:16.154 --> 00:36:20.225
A few of them are now backing up and getting their
drinks, ready to watch. Somebody else at the table

00:36:20.225 --> 00:36:24.980
goes (impacts) and punches somebody else and
starts another aspect, and now there's another bar

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:29.191
fight beginning down the side corner. It's your
go. Oh, wait. Yeah, because he finished the

00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:30.233
heatbutt, so you go.

00:36:30.233 --> 00:36:31.190
LAURA: How much damage was that?

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.985
MATT: Three points of damage. Every time you get
hit, he does three points.

00:36:32.985 --> 00:36:36.509
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. Oh, no, should I be mean?

00:36:36.509 --> 00:36:39.563
TRAVIS: "Should I be mean?"

00:36:39.563 --> 00:36:45.221
LAURA: I'm going to grab him after he hits my head
and I'm going to try to knee him.

00:36:45.221 --> 00:36:47.424
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll for an attack.

00:36:47.424 --> 00:36:51.133
LAURA: That's good, that's 23.

00:36:51.133 --> 00:36:52.474
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits.

00:36:52.474 --> 00:36:54.767
LAURA: Four points of damage right between the
legs.

00:36:54.767 --> 00:37:02.294
MATT: Another four points there. All right. "Ugh!"
His eyes squint and roll backwards a bit and he

00:37:02.294 --> 00:37:08.253
goes down into a crouching position. (grunting)
Rights himself in almost a Muay Thai stance.

00:37:08.253 --> 00:37:10.424
LAURA: Below the belt.

00:37:10.424 --> 00:37:16.884
MATT: Yeah, that's 11. He tries to swing and you
parry it off to the side without an issue. Go

00:37:16.884 --> 00:37:18.336
ahead and retort.

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:20.559
LAURA: I'm going to grab his wrist and try to spin
him around.

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:22.253
MATT: Go for it.

00:37:22.253 --> 00:37:23.191
LAURA: 16.

00:37:23.191 --> 00:37:24.507
MATT: 16 hits!

00:37:24.507 --> 00:37:28.864
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to grab him and try to grab
both of his arms and hold him on to me.

00:37:28.864 --> 00:37:30.155
MATT: Because you're grappling?

00:37:30.155 --> 00:37:30.938
LAURA: Yeah.

00:37:30.938 --> 00:37:33.259
MATT: Roll again for your athletics.

00:37:33.259 --> 00:37:36.741
LAURA: Oh no, that was really bad. Five.

00:37:36.741 --> 00:37:42.508
MATT: He rolled a natural one. Literally a natural
one. He tries to squeeze out, but you've got a

00:37:42.508 --> 00:37:46.223
firm grip on his wrist and you pull him back in.
You're now holding him to you; he's grabbed.

00:37:46.223 --> 00:37:48.112
LAURA: Say uncle, say uncle!

00:37:48.112 --> 00:37:53.817
MATT: "No, never!" It's his turn. He's going to go
try to slam his head backwards into your face.

00:37:53.817 --> 00:38:03.757
Ooh, natural 18, that's a 24. Take another three
points of damage. Crack! It hits you. For a

00:38:03.757 --> 00:38:07.083
second, you're afraid it knocked a tooth out, but
you feel with your tongue and it's still there.

00:38:07.083 --> 00:38:08.640
LAURA: Do I still have a hold of him?

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.260
MATT: Yeah, he's still grappled.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.604
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, I'm going to turn my head and try
to hit him with my horn.

00:38:14.604 --> 00:38:16.723
MATT: Ooh, nice, roll for an attack.

00:38:16.723 --> 00:38:22.668
LAURA: Oh, that was cocked. Crazy cocked. 19!

00:38:22.668 --> 00:38:28.976
MATT: 19 hits, takes another four damage. Crack!
It scrapes across his temple and it almost gouges

00:38:28.976 --> 00:38:35.909
an eye, and he turns and he's like, "Ah! You're
rambunctious, aren't you?" He's going to attempt

00:38:35.909 --> 00:38:40.638
to throw you off over his shoulder, pull you into
a roll. You get to make an athletics or acrobatics

00:38:40.638 --> 00:38:43.399
check against him as he tries to break from your
grapple.

00:38:43.399 --> 00:38:46.548
TRAVIS: I got one gold on the blue one. Anyone
want one gold on the blue one?

00:38:46.548 --> 00:38:48.691
LAURA: Oh no, six.

00:38:48.691 --> 00:38:50.448
SAM: I'll take that bet!

00:38:50.448 --> 00:38:55.789
MATT: Breaks free and slams you onto your back.
You're now prone from the reversal, but it's your

00:38:55.789 --> 00:38:57.994
round, so you can get up or attack if you want
to.

00:38:57.994 --> 00:39:04.485
LAURA: Can I do a breakdancing move where I spin
around and jump up? Like Arya did in that episode

00:39:04.485 --> 00:39:05.586
of Game of Thrones.

00:39:05.586 --> 00:39:06.720
MATT: Sure, yeah.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.642
SAM: Who? Did you say Mario?

00:39:08.642 --> 00:39:10.036
LAURA: Arya.

00:39:10.036 --> 00:39:12.663
MARISHA: What's Avantika doing?

00:39:12.663 --> 00:39:18.136
MATT: She's drinking and watching. One leg up on
the table and she's glancing over, watching this

00:39:18.136 --> 00:39:20.968
transpire. You're going to sweep as you get up?

00:39:20.968 --> 00:39:21.636
LAURA: Yeah.

00:39:21.636 --> 00:39:23.764
MATT: Roll for attack.

00:39:23.764 --> 00:39:25.217
LAURA: 13.

00:39:25.217 --> 00:39:26.746
MATT: 13 does not hit.

00:39:26.746 --> 00:39:27.565
LAURA: No!

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:31.535
MATT: You sweep and he leaps up and then, from the
air, tries to come down onto your leg with the

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:34.906
full force of his tiny gnomish body. Natural 20.

00:39:34.906 --> 00:39:37.671
TRAVIS: (groaning)

00:39:37.671 --> 00:39:41.101
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, because
the nature of the 20, we'll make it double full

00:39:41.101 --> 00:39:47.261
damage, because it's fist fights, that's six
damage to you from that. Crack! The leg and the

00:39:47.261 --> 00:39:51.318
knee doesn't dislocate or pop out, but you can
feel it get pushed to the limit and it hurts like

00:39:51.318 --> 00:39:58.111
a mother. Leaps up and like, "Not too bad! Come
on, bring it!" One eye's a little bit-- not

00:39:58.111 --> 00:40:03.487
swollen, but it's starting to squint from pain.
Blood's leaking out of his nose and his mouth and

00:40:03.487 --> 00:40:06.671
it's smeared on one side of his cheek and he's
(chuckling).

00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:09.207
LAURA: You're crazy, Sorris. I like you.

00:40:09.207 --> 00:40:10.289
MATT: "I like you too--"

00:40:10.289 --> 00:40:14.432
LAURA: Boom! Right in the face. 16 to hit!

00:40:14.432 --> 00:40:18.698
MATT: 16 hits. That's another four damage on him.
Crack, crack! This next series of hits come at him

00:40:18.698 --> 00:40:25.100
and he's like, "Ha! Yeah, it's nothing! I can take
it! Bring it!" He's going to come forward and try

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:33.510
do a series of pummeling in your direction.
Natural one. The sheer impact of the last blow

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:37.175
seems to have knocked his block off, and he starts
doing this series of pummeling in the wrong

00:40:37.175 --> 00:40:45.824
direction, instead pushing toward Caduceus. He
moves out of the way. He batters at the side of

00:40:45.824 --> 00:40:54.564
his sleeve there and, "Ha! How's that? Did I get
her? Wait." Looks around and finds you. "Hi." Your turn.

00:40:54.573 --> 00:41:01.151
LAURA: I'm going to say: All right, all right, all
right. We're friends now, okay? Let's not do any

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:06.813
real damage to each other. I'm going to pat his
head and cast Cure Wounds.

00:41:06.813 --> 00:41:08.878
ALL: Aww.

00:41:08.878 --> 00:41:11.131
SAM: We're awwing.

00:41:11.131 --> 00:41:13.382
TRAVIS: He's on the edge, finish him!

00:41:13.382 --> 00:41:17.506
LAURA: I don't want to knock him out, he's cute.
1st-level.

00:41:17.506 --> 00:41:20.450
LIAM: You have mashed his hair spikes down.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:27.882
LAURA: That is six points of healing.

00:41:27.882 --> 00:41:29.862
TALIESIN: That's two punches taken away.

00:41:29.862 --> 00:41:31.575
MATT: One and a half.

00:41:31.575 --> 00:41:33.967
LAURA: We're friends now.

00:41:33.967 --> 00:41:38.520
MATT: He goes, "Huh. Thank you?"

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.846
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:41:39.846 --> 00:41:41.777
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:41:41.777 --> 00:41:48.105
LAURA: Oh no. Ooh, 21?

00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:56.262
MATT: He looks at you for a second. "Yeah. Good
point. I could've taken you anyway."

00:41:56.262 --> 00:41:57.737
LAURA: Yeah, no.

00:41:57.737 --> 00:41:59.389
MATT: "We'll pick this up another day."

00:41:59.389 --> 00:42:03.051
LAURA: All right. Hey! I made a friend!

00:42:03.051 --> 00:42:05.741
SAM: Yes, you did. Good job, Jester!

00:42:05.741 --> 00:42:07.446
TRAVIS: Yeah, and you kept all your teeth.

00:42:07.446 --> 00:42:09.708
LAURA and MARISHA: Pirates!

00:42:09.708 --> 00:42:14.817
MATT: He comes up and goes for a handshake, grabs
your hand, pulls you and gives you a soft

00:42:14.817 --> 00:42:20.399
headbutt. It's a little sore on both of you and
both of you wince. "Pleasure to meet you. What's

00:42:20.399 --> 00:42:22.836
"your name?"

00:42:22.836 --> 00:42:25.467
LAURA: The Little Sapphire. That's my pirate
name.

00:42:25.467 --> 00:42:34.496
MATT: "Okay. Sorris. Pleasure to meet you as
well." As you guys are having this conversation,

00:42:34.496 --> 00:42:40.015
you hear behind you (grunting, crashing). Another
table behind is broken and you can see a person

00:42:40.015 --> 00:42:44.299
unconscious across the shattered pieces of wood,
arms curled in t-rex style.

00:42:44.299 --> 00:42:46.269
TRAVIS: Nott, unconscious person down.

00:42:46.269 --> 00:42:51.445
SAM: Ooh! I'm going to go steal from them. Oh,
wait, no, you can't do that on this island.

00:42:51.445 --> 00:42:53.361
MARISHA: Is that Blues Traveler?

00:42:53.361 --> 00:42:55.699
SAM: It is the Traveler.

00:42:55.699 --> 00:43:04.632
MATT: The crowd goes, (cheering). Everyone who was
mildly disappointed at the lack of finale to your

00:43:04.907 --> 00:43:08.904
fight has now focused on the other one that has
completed with the smashing of furniture, the

00:43:09.023 --> 00:43:14.200
person on there left scrapped up and wrecked. The
other individual, one eye swollen shut,

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:20.854
square-jawed, burly-looking guy going, "Yeah!"
Everyone cheers.

00:43:20.854 --> 00:43:23.905
TRAVIS: What's the rest of Avantika's crew doing?
Are they in the scrap as well?

00:43:23.905 --> 00:43:29.534
MATT: They're just watching. The scrap was only
between two or three people, and one of them just

00:43:29.534 --> 00:43:34.663
went down. The other one called it off after that
and the declared winner everyone's briefly

00:43:34.663 --> 00:43:38.026
focusing on. Then as fast as everyone cared,
everyone sat back down and they're back to

00:43:38.026 --> 00:43:42.802
drinking. You get the sense in that moment this is
not a rare occurrence around here.

00:43:42.802 --> 00:43:44.515
TRAVIS: Hourly flare-up.

00:43:44.515 --> 00:43:48.791
TALIESIN: It's like someone ordered a special at
an extremely expensive tiki bar.

00:43:48.791 --> 00:43:53.687
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Uk'otoa, Uk'otoa, Uk'otoa,
huh!

00:43:53.687 --> 00:43:59.733
TRAVIS: Wow, where the fuck did you guys just go?
I hope we're going there after this show.

00:43:59.733 --> 00:44:01.803
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Go to Trader Sam's.

00:44:01.803 --> 00:44:03.714
MARISHA: Where that mug came from!

00:44:03.714 --> 00:44:06.932
TALIESIN: That's why I have my tiki mug today.

00:44:06.932 --> 00:44:15.526
LIAM: Caleb brings a big mug of ale and sits down
close to Avantika and says, over this din: This is

00:44:15.526 --> 00:44:24.482
a big longshot, but you seem very well-traveled
and well-researched. This place is crazy, but any

00:44:24.482 --> 00:44:34.284
place worth its salt has books. Why are you
laughing at me? Why are you laughing at me? Such a

00:44:34.284 --> 00:44:39.843
straightforward question. Well, I can tell from
your reaction that there is probably no good place

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:45.182
to acquire a book, but you seem more educated than
the normal sort-- or people around me-- so perhaps

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:48.635
you have a suggestion for a scholar lost at sea?

00:44:48.635 --> 00:44:56.870
MATT: "It is a very curious question. I imagine
there are probably some books. That wouldn't be

00:44:56.870 --> 00:45:06.803
"what is commonly considered contraband or heavy
resale value. Most of the time when you are

00:45:06.803 --> 00:45:12.503
"boarding a ship, you leave the books behind. If
you're looking for books, your best bet is to go

00:45:12.503 --> 00:45:15.200
"to the Sundry Square during the day."

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.392
LIAM: Sundry Square, during the day.

00:45:17.392 --> 00:45:20.899
MATT: "It's about four blocks to the left after
you leave the outside of here, just outside of the

00:45:20.899 --> 00:45:25.376
"shipyard. It's where all the awnings and ships
are."

00:45:25.376 --> 00:45:29.073
LIAM: Should I be checking the trash bins for
these, then? Or do you think someone might

00:45:29.073 --> 00:45:30.824
actually have them for sale?

00:45:30.824 --> 00:45:33.379
MATT: "You can certainly ask around. Maybe both, I
don't know."

00:45:33.379 --> 00:45:35.657
LIAM: I'm jonesing pretty badly for a good book.

00:45:35.657 --> 00:45:37.560
TALIESIN: I'm looking for a blacksmith, actually,
as well.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.163
MATT: "That is possibly a few around, if I
recall."

00:45:40.163 --> 00:45:45.798
TALIESIN: Somebody worth their salt, since "worth
your salt" is a really nice term. That's great.

00:45:45.798 --> 00:45:49.037
Worth their salt. Somebody worth their salt.

00:45:51.547 --> 00:45:53.782
TRAVIS: Just taken with the saying?

00:45:53.782 --> 00:45:56.297
SAM: He's going to use that a lot? That phrase?

00:45:56.297 --> 00:45:57.891
TALIESIN: It's worth my salt.

00:45:57.891 --> 00:46:05.685
MARISHA: Caduceus, how much is salt worth to you?
Like on a scale of money to nothing?

00:46:05.685 --> 00:46:07.405
LIAM: Like a person's worth.

00:46:07.405 --> 00:46:11.875
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't know. I haven't really
thought about it at all, now that I think about

00:46:11.875 --> 00:46:16.926
it. That's a good question. I mean, there's so
much salt around, to be fair. It would probably

00:46:16.926 --> 00:46:19.072
take a lot of salt to be worth something.

00:46:19.072 --> 00:46:20.206
MARISHA: Sure.

00:46:20.206 --> 00:46:22.964
TALIESIN: I mean, you could get it right out of
the water.

00:46:22.964 --> 00:46:26.996
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a fairly benign saying. Don't
get too lost in it.

00:46:26.996 --> 00:46:30.472
TALIESIN: Everything is worth its salt at that
point, really. It's a terrible currency.

00:46:30.472 --> 00:46:32.755
SAM: Did he drink a lot?

00:46:32.755 --> 00:46:34.750
TRAVIS: I was wondering how empty that cup is.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.715
TALIESIN: Has anyone been watching me drink?

00:46:36.715 --> 00:46:37.950
TRAVIS: I was going to ask.

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:40.164
TALIESIN: I have been nursing the same cup the
entire time and have been fake-sipping it the

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:43.549
entire night. I haven't actually had a drop.

00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:46.006
TRAVIS: You had an ale or whatever everybody else
is drinking?

00:46:46.006 --> 00:46:52.064
TALIESIN: Whatever they handed me. I've been doing
this, to be fair, the entire time we've been together.

00:46:53.203 --> 00:46:55.901
MARISHA: He's Bruce Wayne! Caduceus Wayne.

00:46:55.901 --> 00:46:57.650
TRAVIS: Caduceus Wayne?

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:59.179
SAM and MARISHA: Caduce Wayne!

00:46:59.179 --> 00:47:05.350
MARISHA: I elbow Fjord and I sit down next to
Avantika.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:08.739
LIAM: Oh jeez, take my chair, fine. I'll go get
another.

00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:15.235
MARISHA: Sorry, excuse me, sorry. So Avantika.
What's next for The Squalleater?

00:47:15.235 --> 00:47:21.013
MATT: "Well," and she sits, looks around everyone
at the table, and gestures for everyone to lean in

00:47:21.013 --> 00:47:29.851
a bit. "It looks like we are to, after a couple of
days of travel and supply-gathering, make our way

00:47:29.851 --> 00:47:37.539
"northward to a location that has been brought to
my attention by our quartermaster. There is a

00:47:37.539 --> 00:47:42.433
"likely chance that if there is some sort of
treasure there, it would be of importance to our

00:47:42.433 --> 00:47:52.224
"mission. However, it is a salvage mission, meaning
there will be some diving. So I am looking for a

00:47:52.224 --> 00:47:58.858
"few things to prepare for that so a few of us can
comfortably make our way beneath the waves."

00:47:58.858 --> 00:48:00.887
SAM: Into the water?

00:48:00.887 --> 00:48:04.649
MATT: "Beneath the water, my friend."

00:48:04.649 --> 00:48:12.530
SAM: Do cannon-folk typically go on those trips,
or do cannon-folk typically stay behind with the ship?

00:48:13.222 --> 00:48:14.942
TRAVIS: Gunner master, Nott, gunner master.

00:48:14.942 --> 00:48:16.280
SAM: Gunner master.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:23.981
MATT: "That is up to you. You are welcome to stay
behind. However, if things go correctly, I don't

00:48:23.981 --> 00:48:26.520
"think there will be any worry of drowning."

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:31.460
SAM: Oh. How can you promise that?

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:39.144
MATT: "Trust me. I have a few connections that owe
me a favor or two here on the island. Anyway, I

00:48:39.144 --> 00:48:45.765
"need a day to acquire what is necessary.
Nevertheless--" At this point she looks up at

00:48:45.765 --> 00:48:55.274
somebody past you and goes, "We're having a
private discussion." You turn and follow her eye

00:48:55.274 --> 00:49:03.816
line and you see a human female with curled blonde
hair. The curls have fallen in the moisture and

00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:12.273
the rain from the outside, dressed in a thick,
ragged, black coat, holding a cup, and she goes,

00:49:12.273 --> 00:49:24.082
"Aye, don't worry about me. Just didn't expect
this shore to drag you in quite so soon." There's

00:49:24.082 --> 00:49:25.142
a moment of tension.

00:49:25.142 --> 00:49:26.401
LAURA: Do we recognize her?

00:49:26.401 --> 00:49:33.666
MATT: No, you have not seen this figure before.
They both stare for a second, and she turns and

00:49:33.666 --> 00:49:35.128
walks off to a far table.

00:49:35.128 --> 00:49:36.863
TRAVIS: Was she directing that towards Avantika?

00:49:36.863 --> 00:49:37.420
MATT: Yeah.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:38.859
LAURA: Who was that?

00:49:38.859 --> 00:49:42.723
MARISHA: What? What did she say? Haven't heard--
didn't expect this-- what?

00:49:42.723 --> 00:49:54.045
MATT: "Don't mind her. It's Allison; she's--
what's the word? A right cunt."

00:49:54.045 --> 00:49:59.961
TALIESIN: Not Heather. Make a note.

00:49:59.961 --> 00:50:02.506
SAM: Friend of yours, or former friend?

00:50:02.506 --> 00:50:14.059
MATT: "Oh, best of friends. No, just a very nosy
co-thief at sea. Doesn't know where to stop poking

00:50:14.059 --> 00:50:15.927
"where it doesn't belong."

00:50:15.927 --> 00:50:17.824
LIAM: Former business associate?

00:50:17.824 --> 00:50:26.612
MATT: "No, former competitor. Anyway."

00:50:26.612 --> 00:50:28.779
MARISHA: I immediately grab my purse and hold onto
it.

00:50:28.779 --> 00:50:31.460
SAM: What purse?

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:35.750
MARISHA: The thing I imagine most adventurers
have. A little coin satchel.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.168
SAM: Oh, but not like a cute little--

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:42.171
MARISHA: No, not a Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana, no. Not a Kate
Spade.

00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:50.088
TRAVIS: You mean a competitor in terms of sea
space, or in terms of your faith?

00:50:50.088 --> 00:51:03.713
MATT: "No, we've crossed territories once or
twice, and she has a habit of trying to embellish

00:51:03.713 --> 00:51:12.647
"truths to the Plank King. Anyway." Hand me the
map, if you don't mind. Oh, map's here, actually.

00:51:12.647 --> 00:51:16.546
SAM: I knew someone like that once. They would
always go fishing and say that they caught

00:51:16.546 --> 00:51:18.287
something, but they never did.

00:51:18.287 --> 00:51:19.747
TALIESIN: A fisherman?

00:51:19.747 --> 00:51:20.613
SAM: Yes.

00:51:20.613 --> 00:51:22.870
MATT: Avantika lays a map out on the table.

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:25.282
SAM: Ooh, we'll put our weights down to weigh it
down.

00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:27.852
MARISHA: No, there was a discussion. It's coming.

00:51:27.852 --> 00:51:31.334
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Coasters are not heavy enough.

00:51:31.334 --> 00:51:34.736
TALIESIN: Here's a cube. Have a cube.

00:51:34.736 --> 00:51:36.551
MATT: A cube will do.

00:51:36.551 --> 00:51:38.559
TALIESIN: There's a cube.

00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:40.296
SAM: There's a cube.

00:51:40.296 --> 00:51:44.586
MATT: As Avantika points it out, she shows the
crew and says, "In two days travel, we will make

00:51:44.657 --> 00:51:52.819
"our way outside of the Dragshallow Reef, coasting
in northward for protection to about here. We

00:51:52.819 --> 00:52:00.366
"begin looking for our salvage." At which point,
Orly, who's glancing over the side, rubs his chin

00:52:00.366 --> 00:52:15.534
and goes, "Hmm. I don't mean to question the
captain's m-m-main objective; however, that looks

00:52:15.534 --> 00:52:21.490
"like it's right around where the Diver's Grave
m-m-may be."

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:24.175
TRAVIS: Diver's Grave?

00:52:24.175 --> 00:52:32.607
MATT: She looks back and goes, "Perhaps, but does
it spook you? Do ghost stories make you shiver,

00:52:32.607 --> 00:52:44.705
"turtle boy?" Orly glances back at her with a
narrowed stare and goes, "As long as I'm staying

00:52:44.705 --> 00:52:51.072
"on the ship, I don't m-m-mind." He goes and sits
back down at the table.

00:52:51.072 --> 00:52:53.868
LAURA: Do divers die there?

00:52:53.868 --> 00:53:00.382
MATT: At this point, Sorris goes, "Oh, is that
where you're going? You're going over to the

00:53:00.382 --> 00:53:03.042
"Diver's Grave?"

00:53:03.042 --> 00:53:05.334
TRAVIS: It would appear so, yeah.

00:53:05.334 --> 00:53:10.693
MATT: "Well, that's certainly an off-limits
location for most salvaging, thanks to the cursed

00:53:10.693 --> 00:53:14.806
"woman, eh? Do you know much about your history?"

00:53:14.806 --> 00:53:19.639
TALIESIN: I'm hoping this is a place where
somebody named Rachel Diver may have bought a

00:53:19.639 --> 00:53:21.720
piece of land or something.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.220
MATT: "Close, but not at all."

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.817
MARISHA: Yeah, or Sophie. It's always a Sophie.

00:53:24.817 --> 00:53:30.461
MATT: Make a history check. You can with
disadvantage, because of your lack of experience

00:53:30.461 --> 00:53:32.770
with the naval history.

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:34.154
LAURA: Would I have heard ghost stories?

00:53:34.154 --> 00:53:36.195
MATT: You can make a history check as well.

00:53:36.195 --> 00:53:37.142
TRAVIS: 15.

00:53:37.142 --> 00:53:38.214
MATT: Okay.

00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:41.214
LAURA: 19!

00:53:41.214 --> 00:53:42.860
LIAM: 13.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:49.921
MATT: Doesn't quite catch your attention. You've
heard mention of the Diver's Grave, as it was a

00:53:49.921 --> 00:54:00.848
series of poems from a book you once read. The
thing that comes to mind is the name Dashilla. You

00:54:00.848 --> 00:54:09.196
instinctively mouth it-- Dashilla-- and he goes,
"Ah, Dashilla the Dreadful. You know about this one, eh?"

00:54:09.196 --> 00:54:11.663
LAURA: I mean, I read a poem about her.

00:54:11.663 --> 00:54:17.633
MATT: "Ah. Poem, I've not known, but maybe the
song you've heard." Some of the crew around nod,

00:54:17.633 --> 00:54:24.400
remembering, and he goes and grabs his cup and
claps it twice to the table, and the crew begins

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.923
to filter in as the song progresses, and he
goes--

00:54:26.923 --> 00:54:32.815
MARISHA: If there's not 12 people that pop out
behind this curtain, I'm going to be disappointed.

00:54:32.815 --> 00:54:34.171
MATT: So he finishes the song.

00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:37.653
(laughter)

00:54:37.653 --> 00:54:40.409
TALIESIN: I was waiting for him to go, "Bill
Murray."

00:54:40.409 --> 00:54:48.647
MATT: Sorris goes, (singing) "Where once the
waters rolled calmly by, where ocean's heart did

00:54:48.647 --> 00:54:57.952
"sing, there stalked a lass with a hungry eye and
claws that grasp and wring. With lantern lure of a

00:54:57.952 --> 00:55:06.421
"glimmer pot, with treasure in her eyes, below they
swam to the gold they thought would await them as

00:55:06.421 --> 00:55:12.421
"their prize." Everyone starts clamoring together
with the third verse, (singing) "Yet each of them

00:55:12.421 --> 00:55:21.062
"went to surely die, their graves to not be found.
For Dashilla and her hungry eye collects the lost

00:55:21.062 --> 00:55:26.208
"and drowned." There's a moment where they all
begin to clamor the drinks together and clink them

00:55:26.208 --> 00:55:27.784
and begin to drink them.

00:55:27.784 --> 00:55:30.338
(applause)

00:55:30.338 --> 00:55:33.162
TRAVIS: Yeah! That's fortuitous.

00:55:34.139 --> 00:55:36.412
LAURA: Her hungry eye.

00:55:36.412 --> 00:55:37.565
TRAVIS: Her claws.

00:55:37.565 --> 00:55:38.715
MARISHA: Her lantern light.

00:55:38.715 --> 00:55:40.976
LAURA: Doesn't she have a ring or something that
you said in the song?

00:55:40.976 --> 00:55:44.013
MARISHA: Yeah, I heard something about a ring, and
treasure in her eyes.

00:55:44.013 --> 00:55:47.436
MATT: He looks confused, "So you don't know the
poem or the song."

00:55:47.436 --> 00:55:53.096
LAURA: No, I know it, I just didn't-- I mean, I
read it like, one time, a long time ago.

00:55:53.096 --> 00:55:55.193
MATT: "Do you want a reprisal?"

00:55:55.193 --> 00:55:56.888
LAURA: Yeah.

00:55:57.417 --> 00:56:02.920
MATT: (clears throat, singing) "Where once the
waters rolled calmly by, where ocean's heart did

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:11.328
"sing. There stalked a lass with a hungry eye, and
claws that grasp and wring. With lantern lure of a

00:56:11.328 --> 00:56:18.767
"glimmer pot, with treasure in their eyes. Below
they swam to the gold they thought would await

surely die, their graves to not be found. For

00:56:26.928 --> 00:56:32.933
"Dashilla and her hungry eye collects the lost and
drowned."

00:56:32.933 --> 00:56:36.564
TRAVIS: Single eye, huh?

00:56:36.564 --> 00:56:38.439
TALIESIN: Damn!

00:56:38.439 --> 00:56:41.523
TRAVIS: Anyone else getting a bad feeling about
that?

00:56:41.523 --> 00:56:45.351
LAURA: No, why would you ever get a bad feeling
about that?

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:48.823
SAM: (record scratching) Remix!

00:56:50.317 --> 00:56:54.262
TRAVIS: (low-pitched) Break it, break it, break it
down.

00:56:54.262 --> 00:56:57.698
LAURA: Her hungry eye.

00:56:57.698 --> 00:57:03.925
MATT: He goes, "But that's just an old wives'
tale, you know? A myth."

00:57:03.925 --> 00:57:10.080
TRAVIS: Sorris, is that somewhere you've been to?
You seem like a very fortune-seeking type.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.411
MATT: "Well, I sail over it, we just don't really
salvage that."

00:57:12.411 --> 00:57:14.145
TRAVIS: You don't stop, either?

00:57:14.145 --> 00:57:18.930
MATT: "What?! In the middle of the ocean? Why?!
That'd be daft! Good luck." Looks at Avantika,

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:23.032
(singsong) "Good luck! With the missus," and turns
around--

00:57:23.032 --> 00:57:26.100
SAM: With the missus? Oh. The lady--

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:27.453
LAURA: Oh, Dashilla.

00:57:27.453 --> 00:57:32.545
MATT: You surmise that's who he's referring to.
Avantika goes, "Don't pay him any mind. It is a

00:57:32.545 --> 00:57:40.207
"myth, and if it's not, well, we just finished
tangling with a hydra and an entire island of snake

00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:44.522
"people. You're not seriously worried about a
woman, eh?"

00:57:44.522 --> 00:57:46.526
LAURA: Well, we didn't fight them under the water.

00:57:46.592 --> 00:57:50.433
LIAM: Yeah, I'm more concerned about the waves.
You have experience with this? Diving?

00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:58.310
MATT: "I should have an answer to at least most of
our troubles by the morrow. Just be patient."

00:57:58.310 --> 00:57:59.951
LIAM: Yes or no question.

00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:04.958
TRAVIS: You know, most myths are based off of some
sort of fact. We don't happen to know what the

00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:10.743
song thinks this dreadful creature is, do we?

00:58:10.743 --> 00:58:14.357
MATT: "Not any more than you would."

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:17.320
LAURA: She's an underwater banshee. For sure!

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.576
TRAVIS: Is that a thing?

00:58:18.576 --> 00:58:20.783
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:58:20.783 --> 00:58:23.277
TRAVIS: You can't really sing underwater, so how's
that work?

00:58:23.277 --> 00:58:25.615
LAURA: It sounds a lot like glubby glubs.

00:58:25.682 --> 00:58:27.838
(underwater glubbing)

00:58:27.838 --> 00:58:35.965
TRAVIS: I love that everyone did that at the same
time. That's all I needed. Well, great. We'll find

00:58:35.965 --> 00:58:41.129
this solution to the diving in the morning, and
then in a day or two we'll make our way?

00:58:41.129 --> 00:58:42.706
MATT: "That is the idea."

00:58:42.706 --> 00:58:45.561
TRAVIS: Do you need any help securing this
solution?

00:58:45.561 --> 00:58:52.119
MATT: "No, it's best I do it alone. It's more of a
older business relationship. I don't want to make

00:58:52.119 --> 00:59:00.686
"him think that this is a, how do you say,
untrustworthy trade, if you will."

00:59:00.686 --> 00:59:05.022
TRAVIS: Well, being that you'll be out, anything
you need done for the ship or the crew while

00:59:05.022 --> 00:59:07.333
you're away, as your quartermaster?

00:59:07.333 --> 00:59:13.253
MATT: "Well, oversee the repairs to The Mistake, I
believe they've begun before the night is over for

00:59:13.253 --> 00:59:18.757
"a bit. We probably will not need it for this
endeavor, so it will begin and when we return from

00:59:18.757 --> 00:59:20.740
"Darktow it should be complete."

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:26.527
TRAVIS: Wonderful. All right. And your crew? Do I
need to keep an eye on anyone?

00:59:26.527 --> 00:59:34.018
MATT: "Not in particular. They'll be looking
around here, they'll be preparing. Gather their

00:59:34.087 --> 00:59:39.445
"materials, anything you think you require for the
trip at sea go ahead and gather it, go amongst the

00:59:39.445 --> 00:59:46.796
"Sundry Square, purchase what is required, and then
hopefully within the next 48 hours we'll be back

00:59:46.796 --> 00:59:48.593
"out on the waves."

00:59:48.593 --> 00:59:49.687
MARISHA: 48 hours.

00:59:49.687 --> 00:59:50.913
TRAVIS: Wonderful.

00:59:50.913 --> 00:59:55.972
TALIESIN: What's Allison been up to?

00:59:55.972 --> 00:59:59.779
MATT: Drinking in the back, having a conversation
with somebody and keeping one eye over at the

00:59:59.779 --> 01:00:09.080
table. Seems just perturbed. Not directly intent,
but occasionally narrowing her eyes in the

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.276
direction of Avantika.

01:00:11.276 --> 01:00:14.950
TRAVIS: Being that this is our first time in
Darktow, I would like to see the rest of the area.

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:18.423
Would anyone care to join me for a stroll?

01:00:18.423 --> 01:00:19.987
MARISHA: Ooh, night walk?

01:00:19.987 --> 01:00:21.691
TALIESIN: That sounds like a great idea.

01:00:21.691 --> 01:00:22.574
LAURA: Sure.

01:00:22.574 --> 01:00:25.792
MATT: "It is good, if you are going to do a night
walk alone, or together as a group is much better

01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:27.670
"than alone."

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:35.883
TALIESIN: What should we be looking out for? Is
there some sort of natural dangers, unnatural dangers?

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:37.365
TRAVIS: Back corners, alleys?

01:00:37.365 --> 01:00:43.202
MATT: "Well, the laws say you're not to steal from
another pirate in here, but only if they're caught."

01:00:43.202 --> 01:00:44.773
MARISHA: Oh, I forgot.

01:00:44.773 --> 01:00:47.326
LAURA: Oh, you totally could have gotten the stuff
from that guy.

01:00:47.326 --> 01:00:48.813
SAM: (frustrated noise)

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:55.047
MATT: "But there are others out there perhaps who
see fresh faces and think, well, easy prey. Best

01:00:55.047 --> 01:01:01.063
"not to cause a huge commotion immediately after
arriving. Nobody does that, right?"

01:01:01.063 --> 01:01:02.357
TRAVIS: No.

01:01:02.357 --> 01:01:03.794
LAURA: Definitely wouldn't.

01:01:03.794 --> 01:01:07.865
TRAVIS: Who would be so foolish? Little would they
know, they'd be tangling with Avantika's crew, and

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:11.374
that's something they don't want to mess with,
right?

01:01:11.374 --> 01:01:19.319
MATT: "One would think, yes. Anyway, I am a bit
tipsy, and I'm going to find myself an evening's

01:01:19.319 --> 01:01:25.235
"rest. The rest of the night and tomorrow is yours.
Good eve."

01:01:25.235 --> 01:01:26.507
SAM: Bon soir.

01:01:26.507 --> 01:01:27.422
MARISHA: Good night.

01:01:27.422 --> 01:01:28.466
LAURA: Bye.

01:01:28.466 --> 01:01:33.721
MATT: As she gets up, some of the rest of the crew
stands up, you see Bouldergut in the back stand up

01:01:33.721 --> 01:01:41.987
as soon as the captain stands up, and goes like,
"We going?" "Come on, this way." Walks by, puts

01:01:41.987 --> 01:01:46.865
her hand on your shoulder, and into your ear,
Fjord, as she whispers, she goes, "I'm staying

01:01:46.865 --> 01:01:53.302
"upstairs, second room on the left," and leaves.

01:01:53.302 --> 01:01:55.443
LAURA: Did any of us see that?

01:01:55.443 --> 01:01:57.570
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:01:57.842 --> 01:01:59.643
LAURA: (laughter)

01:01:59.643 --> 01:02:01.247
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a bad roll.

01:02:01.247 --> 01:02:03.225
TRAVIS: You see everything, why are you even
rolling?

01:02:03.225 --> 01:02:04.231
TALIESIN: 11.

01:02:04.231 --> 01:02:05.170
MARISHA: It feels pretty public.

01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:06.124
LAURA: 15.

01:02:06.124 --> 01:02:10.160
TRAVIS: You've got fucking Mad-Eye Moody's eye
where it's on me the whole time and the other

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.203
one's doing its own thing.

01:02:12.203 --> 01:02:18.101
MATT: Actually, Caduceus, just from his passive
perception, has seen this. What did you roll?

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.083
LAURA: 15.

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:25.181
MATT: 15? You see there's a momentary pause as she
walks by, and the hand on the shoulder that

01:02:25.181 --> 01:02:31.998
catches your attention. You can see the lips
move and make out the essence of the conversation.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:37.416
The rest of her crew slowly gets up, and some of
them stay to drink, some of them go out to find

01:02:37.416 --> 01:02:39.419
their way in the night.

01:02:39.419 --> 01:02:41.822
MARISHA: I need to pee. Anyone know where the
bathroom is?

01:02:41.822 --> 01:02:43.716
LIAM: Pretty sure it's anywhere.

01:02:43.716 --> 01:02:46.154
TALIESIN: Outside.

01:02:48.204 --> 01:02:51.774
MATT: You do recall, walking through the city, a
number of individuals stopping at the edge of the

01:02:51.774 --> 01:02:53.977
docks and pissing into the ocean.

01:02:53.977 --> 01:03:01.370
SAM: In Halfling I will say to Beauregard: Hey,
don't you think we should go talk to that Allison person?

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:04.947
MARISHA: I was already on it, I respond back in
Halfling.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.110
SAM: Can I tag along?

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:08.211
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Jester?

01:03:08.211 --> 01:03:09.194
LAURA: Mm?

01:03:09.194 --> 01:03:11.514
MARISHA: Do you have a pen and paper I could
borrow?

01:03:11.514 --> 01:03:13.733
SAM: She asks in Halfling.

01:03:13.733 --> 01:03:15.748
LAURA: I don't understand what--

01:03:15.748 --> 01:03:22.128
MARISHA: Sorry, got caught in a language loop. Do
you have any pencil and paper, or pen and ink?

01:03:22.128 --> 01:03:25.845
LAURA: Yeah! Well, of course I do, I always have a
lot of stuff on me, here you go.

01:03:25.934 --> 01:03:36.449
MARISHA: Just like a scrap, thank you. I scribble,
"Meet in the alley" on the piece of paper. Is

01:03:36.449 --> 01:03:38.551
there an alley? I'm assuming there's an alley
behind this.

01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:40.138
MATT: I mean--

01:03:40.138 --> 01:03:41.795
SAM: There's no streets, it's all alleys.

01:03:41.795 --> 01:03:49.106
MATT: It's entirely crafted of alleys. No, I mean,
it's not very jam-packed around this particular

01:03:49.106 --> 01:03:56.513
tavern/inn, but there are some nearby buildings
where there are alleys. This place is surrounded

01:03:56.513 --> 01:04:00.137
by streets because it's right there on the front
near the shipyard.

01:04:00.137 --> 01:04:08.391
MARISHA: "Meet in the back alley." To be
specific.

01:04:08.391 --> 01:04:09.709
SAM: Vague directions.

01:04:09.709 --> 01:04:12.954
MATT: Okay, and what do you do?

01:04:12.954 --> 01:04:17.782
MARISHA: Will you go with me to the ladies' room
so we can powder our noses together?

01:04:17.782 --> 01:04:20.328
SAM: Sure. I love a good powder.

01:04:20.328 --> 01:04:31.766
MARISHA: Let's go powder. As I walk out, I shake
Alice's hand, say: Nice to meet you. And palm her

01:04:31.766 --> 01:04:35.207
the piece of paper that's folded very tightly.

01:04:35.207 --> 01:04:41.299
MATT: Okay. As you take her hand, she pulls back.
You get a closer look at her, there's this heavy

01:04:41.299 --> 01:04:46.584
scar over one eye that keeps the eye mostly
closed. You can see there looks to be a ruined eye

01:04:46.584 --> 01:04:53.400
beneath there that's healed over and is not
functional. She wears it proudly as a point of

01:04:53.400 --> 01:05:04.128
intimidation or at least a badge of whatever gave
her that scar. As she pulls back a little bit, her

01:05:04.128 --> 01:05:08.282
other hand going towards the dagger on the side
that's now revealed from behind her coat. You palm

01:05:08.282 --> 01:05:10.883
her the note and she looks and takes it--

01:05:10.883 --> 01:05:12.949
MARISHA: Give her a wink and walk off.

01:05:12.949 --> 01:05:16.955
MATT: She crumples it with a terse look and lets
it fall to the ground.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:19.713
LIAM: Ooh! Cold.

01:05:19.827 --> 01:05:30.101
MARISHA: I go-- and I walk out. She'll read it,
right?

01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:33.769
SAM: Where's the bathroom?

01:05:33.769 --> 01:05:35.875
TALIESIN: I'm going to get some air.

01:05:35.875 --> 01:05:37.559
TRAVIS: Ridiculous.

01:05:40.243 --> 01:05:44.870
SAM: We just walked across the whole place. I
haven't seen the bathroom once.

01:05:46.729 --> 01:05:48.845
MARISHA: Let's go around to the side of the
building.

01:05:48.845 --> 01:05:51.612
SAM: Oh? We're just going to take a shit in the
alley?

01:05:51.612 --> 01:05:54.885
MARISHA: We are a hundred percent going to take a
shit in the alley.

01:05:54.885 --> 01:06:00.047
LIAM: Here comes the fanart. I hope.

01:06:00.949 --> 01:06:05.763
MATT: You guys walk out into the cold night air.
The heavy mist has fallen across Darktow and you

01:06:05.763 --> 01:06:11.143
can barely see beyond the outskirts of the city
where the ocean begins. You can still hear the

01:06:11.143 --> 01:06:15.784
waters coming in against the rocks on the outside
of the island, but you cannot actually see where

01:06:15.859 --> 01:06:20.564
the water connects. Beyond that, you can see the
outline of the ship masts that are set at the end

01:06:20.564 --> 01:06:26.371
of the shipyard that are vanishing into the mist
that surround you. What do you do?

01:06:26.371 --> 01:06:32.336
MARISHA: I go towards the back "alley".

01:06:32.336 --> 01:06:36.312
MATT: Okay. You find what would be considered an
alley behind the Inn and Tavern.

01:06:36.312 --> 01:06:48.210
MARISHA: I show Nott where to take a shit. I wait
either for the rest of my friends or for Alice to

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:50.376
eventually read the damn thing--

01:06:50.376 --> 01:06:51.785
SAM: Is it Alice or Allison?

01:06:51.785 --> 01:06:52.797
LAURA: I thought it was Allison.

01:06:52.797 --> 01:06:54.038
MARISHA: Allison.

01:06:54.038 --> 01:06:56.179
TRAVIS: She's on a nickname basis already.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:59.561
SAM: Maybe that's why she didn't listen to you.
Because you called her the wrong name.

01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:02.434
TRAVIS: She's like, "We're not there yet! We're
not fucking Alice yet."

01:07:02.434 --> 01:07:03.837
MARISHA: It works half of the time.

01:07:03.837 --> 01:07:05.110
LAURA: That's so pretty.

01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:06.162
MARISHA: It's super awesome.

01:07:06.162 --> 01:07:07.649
SAM: If she comes out here, what are we going to
say to her?

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:11.611
MARISHA: I just want to figure out what her beef
is with Avantika. Maybe she can be our key--

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:16.506
SAM: But she's going to ask who we are. What do we
tell her? That we're disgruntled members of her crew?

01:07:16.506 --> 01:07:17.696
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:07:17.696 --> 01:07:21.858
SAM: But she can turn us in! That's terrible. We
should say that we're--

01:07:21.858 --> 01:07:25.681
MARISHA: We can get information from her first. We
don't have to necessarily always give information

01:07:25.681 --> 01:07:31.034
upfront to get information and we can always lie.

01:07:31.034 --> 01:07:33.308
SAM: I'm not good at that.

01:07:33.308 --> 01:07:34.144
MARISHA: I am.

01:07:34.144 --> 01:07:34.967
SAM: Okay.

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:35.689
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:07:35.689 --> 01:07:41.530
SAM: Yeah, you're right. You're very charismatic.
We're going to be fine.

01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:43.241
MARISHA: I feel like that's slightly underhanded.

01:07:43.241 --> 01:07:48.792
SAM: No! It seems that way because I'm making a
face because I'm halfway through a dump right now.

01:07:48.792 --> 01:07:53.553
MARISHA: I don't break eye contact.

01:07:53.553 --> 01:07:59.785
SAM and MARISHA: We got this.

01:07:59.785 --> 01:08:03.899
TRAVIS: Oh! The hand touch! No!

01:08:03.899 --> 01:08:06.251
SAM: I'm ready.

01:08:06.535 --> 01:08:07.594
MARISHA: All right.

01:08:07.594 --> 01:08:08.780
TALIESIN: Maybe that is better.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:09.998
LAURA: We've reached a new level.

01:08:09.998 --> 01:08:11.305
TRAVIS: Maybe that is better, yeah.

01:08:11.305 --> 01:08:15.724
LIAM: (as Nott) All right! I'm done! Hand me that
dead cat!

01:08:17.436 --> 01:08:22.958
MATT: Here we have the direct connection from
campaign one to campaign two: Sam has taken a shit

01:08:22.958 --> 01:08:31.191
live with both characters in-narrative.
Congratulations.

01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:35.183
SAM: You're welcome, Gary Gygax.

01:08:35.957 --> 01:08:38.228
MATT: What are the rest of you doing? Caduceus,
you went out for some fresh air.

01:08:38.228 --> 01:08:44.149
TALIESIN: I went out. I'm standing by the front
door, bouncer-like, and trying to get my bearings,

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:46.874
take a look around, see what the vibe of this
place is.

01:08:46.874 --> 01:08:48.620
TRAVIS: I'm come join him out front.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.891
MATT: Jester?

01:08:49.891 --> 01:08:56.565
LAURA: I'm staring at this milk that I ordered and
it's really disgusting. And I--

01:08:56.565 --> 01:08:58.270
LIAM: You're not going to drink that, are you?

01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:00.648
LAURA: No, it has lumps in it.

01:09:00.648 --> 01:09:02.655
LIAM: Yeah. Well, it's a lumpy place.

01:09:02.655 --> 01:09:03.610
LAURA: Yeah.

01:09:03.610 --> 01:09:07.342
LIAM: You doing okay? You seem a little off to
me.

01:09:07.342 --> 01:09:11.532
LAURA: What? I seem off?

01:09:11.532 --> 01:09:16.469
LIAM: Yeah, you seem distracted around this
woman.

01:09:16.469 --> 01:09:17.897
LAURA: Oh. I just, well--

01:09:17.897 --> 01:09:18.928
MARISHA: (sneezes)

01:09:18.928 --> 01:09:20.592
MATT and LAURA: Bless you.

01:09:20.592 --> 01:09:22.134
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

01:09:22.134 --> 01:09:25.814
LAURA: I don't like her very much.

01:09:25.814 --> 01:09:28.153
LIAM: Oh, is it because she's a murderer?

01:09:28.153 --> 01:09:30.050
LAURA: No.

01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:32.489
LIAM: Oh. I don't like that part about her.

01:09:32.489 --> 01:09:36.812
LAURA: Oh, but we're all kind of murderers
sometimes, aren't we?

01:09:40.394 --> 01:09:42.644
LIAM: I don't think that all of us are murderers.

01:09:42.644 --> 01:09:43.762
LAURA: No?

01:09:44.242 --> 01:09:46.771
LIAM: Are you a murderer?

01:09:46.771 --> 01:09:48.404
LAURA: I mean, we have killed some people.

01:09:48.404 --> 01:09:54.077
LIAM: Yeah, but that's a very specific thing. You
know, if your life is in danger, that's one thing.

01:09:54.077 --> 01:09:58.624
You know, if something happens in the heat of the
moment or there's danger in both directions.

01:09:58.624 --> 01:10:02.808
Murder is premeditated. That's a very different
thing. I find it hard to believe that you have

01:10:02.808 --> 01:10:07.145
killed someone with premeditation. I could be
wrong but--

01:10:07.145 --> 01:10:12.135
LAURA: No, I don't. I haven't ever done that. I've
done some pretty shady stuff though.

01:10:12.135 --> 01:10:13.286
LIAM: That I believe.

01:10:13.286 --> 01:10:15.129
LAURA: Have you done some shady stuff?

01:10:15.129 --> 01:10:16.214
LIAM: Yes, I have.

01:10:16.214 --> 01:10:19.015
LAURA: Have you done stuff that's pirate-y before
you were a pirate?

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:21.164
LIAM: Yeah. Sort of.

01:10:21.164 --> 01:10:23.638
LAURA: What's the shadiest thing you ever did?

01:10:23.638 --> 01:10:31.768
LIAM: Oh. Well, Nott and I have robbed people for
sure. People with not a lot of money so that we can eat.

01:10:31.768 --> 01:10:33.112
LAURA: That's okay, though.

01:10:33.112 --> 01:10:38.432
LIAM: That did that we did to you when we first
met you. You know, we turn one thing into another

01:10:38.432 --> 01:10:44.562
and then we go stay at an inn and buy food and
then it turns back into pennies and that's not so

01:10:44.562 --> 01:10:48.209
good, but when you're starving.

01:10:48.209 --> 01:10:51.925
LAURA: But it is a really cool trick. They got to
see magic.

01:10:51.925 --> 01:10:54.801
LIAM: They didn't know it, though.

01:10:54.801 --> 01:11:00.154
LAURA: That's true. It all balances out. You've
done really good things, too.

01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:02.096
LIAM: Yeah.

01:11:03.658 --> 01:11:07.624
LAURA: Do you want some of this lumpy milk?

01:11:07.624 --> 01:11:09.710
LIAM: No. Do you want any ale?

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:11.637
LAURA: No.

01:11:12.365 --> 01:11:16.559
LIAM: Boy, this is quite a predicament that we've
gotten ourselves into. How the hell-- we were

01:11:16.559 --> 01:11:18.681
visiting your mother. Your mother was so lovely--

01:11:18.681 --> 01:11:24.410
LAURA: I know! She's so nice! And now we're
pirates and I'm never going to see her again.

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:27.019
LIAM: That's not true.

01:11:27.019 --> 01:11:32.764
LAURA: It's really possible, Caleb. What if we can
never go home?

01:11:32.764 --> 01:11:47.698
LIAM: We'll get you home. We're here-- this is
Fjord's thing. We're his support. We're here to

01:11:47.698 --> 01:11:55.669
help him out. Beauregard and I don't want to be
here forever either, I don't think. I know that I

01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:59.305
do not want to be in this place or on the sea
forever. It's interesting.

01:11:59.305 --> 01:12:01.496
LAURA: Nott definitely doesn't want to be in the
sea.

01:12:01.496 --> 01:12:07.131
LIAM: Nott is like a cat clinging to the ceiling.
She's like a cat on a hot tin roof.

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.949
LAURA: I think Caduceus doesn't like the water,
either basically because it tried to kill him a

01:12:10.949 --> 01:12:12.477
few times already.

01:12:12.477 --> 01:12:15.154
LIAM: Really none of us like it here but Fjord,
kind of.

01:12:15.154 --> 01:12:17.483
LAURA: I don't even know if he likes it a lot.

01:12:17.483 --> 01:12:19.391
LIAM: There's parts of it that he likes.

01:12:19.391 --> 01:12:20.685
LAURA: Like Avantika.

01:12:20.685 --> 01:12:29.430
LIAM: I don't know. You're sweet on him, yeah?

01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:32.680
LAURA: I don't know.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.974
LIAM: Yeah.

01:12:36.097 --> 01:12:37.593
LAURA: It feels funny.

01:12:37.593 --> 01:12:38.962
LIAM: How do you mean?

01:12:38.962 --> 01:12:44.335
LAURA: Well. You know, when you really like
somebody, but then you start to know them, and you

01:12:44.335 --> 01:12:52.616
go, "Do I like them or do I like what I thought
they were?" and then you don't know?

01:12:52.616 --> 01:12:54.834
LIAM: I think so.

01:12:54.834 --> 01:12:58.485
LAURA: And then you think that they are flirting
with you, but then you found out that probably

01:12:58.485 --> 01:13:00.792
weren't, you know?

01:13:00.792 --> 01:13:02.873
MARISHA: Or just saving your life.

01:13:05.095 --> 01:13:11.308
LAURA: So you feel kind of sad about it and maybe
a little stupid.

01:13:12.977 --> 01:13:20.113
LIAM: That's a little out of my realm of
experience. I'm sorry.

01:13:20.428 --> 01:13:28.155
LAURA: You had a girlfriend before though, yeah?
(whispering) You said her name when we were

01:13:28.155 --> 01:13:35.231
dancing and then I put you to sleep and you said
her name again.

01:13:35.231 --> 01:13:38.212
LIAM: I don't forget anything.

01:13:38.212 --> 01:13:41.145
LAURA: Was she pretty?

01:13:41.758 --> 01:13:43.682
LIAM: She was handsome.

01:13:43.682 --> 01:13:46.460
LAURA: Was she a boy?

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.116
LIAM: No. I said she.

01:13:48.116 --> 01:13:50.065
LAURA: Oh. Okay.

01:13:50.604 --> 01:13:52.996
LIAM: She was handsome.

01:13:57.338 --> 01:14:02.623
LAURA: I'm trying to get an image of her in my
brain here.

01:14:02.623 --> 01:14:03.383
LIAM: Yeah?

01:14:03.383 --> 01:14:05.816
LAURA: Did she have like a really good nose or
something?

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:06.724
LIAM: The best.

01:14:06.724 --> 01:14:07.706
LAURA: Really?

01:14:07.706 --> 01:14:10.051
LIAM: For me.

01:14:11.971 --> 01:14:15.770
LAURA: You're mysterious, Caleb, you know that?

01:14:16.279 --> 01:14:24.958
LIAM: That was a long time ago, anyway. Let's just
focus on getting out of this place away from that woman.

01:14:24.958 --> 01:14:31.099
LAURA: And now she's saying we all have to take
the same boat. How are we going to get away from her?

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:34.759
LIAM: Is there anyone paying attention to us?

01:14:34.759 --> 01:14:37.065
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:14:37.065 --> 01:14:38.817
TALIESIN: Where are you guys talking?

01:14:38.817 --> 01:14:41.612
LAURA: Just literally right there at the table.

01:14:41.612 --> 01:14:42.365
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind.

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:47.466
LIAM: Or like just leaning in a table together
very low. Elf. 11.

01:14:47.531 --> 01:14:56.457
MATT: Okay. The crowd is pretty vibrant around
here. A quick glance around you, you don't see

01:14:56.457 --> 01:14:59.242
anybody specifically paying attention or
interested.

01:14:59.318 --> 01:15:09.388
LIAM: Well, I don't care. I'm pulling out the wire
and I'm putting it in my mouth. We'll take care of

01:15:09.388 --> 01:15:15.710
her if we have to. (coughing)

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:17.094
LAURA: Are you okay?

01:15:17.094 --> 01:15:28.846
LIAM: Yeah, just a cough. A cold. I want to get
the hell off this island eventually, but we're

01:15:28.846 --> 01:15:30.607
here now. Tomorrow--

01:15:30.607 --> 01:15:32.764
LAURA: Tomorrow, we find some books!

01:15:32.764 --> 01:15:38.766
LIAM: Yes! We'll find-- no. Probably not. But
we'll get sorted. We'll make the best of this

01:15:38.766 --> 01:15:44.673
place. We'll help Fjord figure out his shit, I
suppose.

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.940
LAURA: Yeah, that's important to him.

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:54.383
LIAM: Yeah. Then we'll get out of here and then
you can reassess back on dry land.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:58.641
LAURA: Yeah. Thanks, Caleb.

01:15:59.602 --> 01:16:02.756
LIAM: Thanks for not leaving me on the street like
a drunk.

01:16:02.756 --> 01:16:08.150
LAURA: (giggles) I thought about it. It would have
been pretty funny for you to wake up, but I like

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:15.090
you more than that. Are we sleeping on our boat?
Where should I go?

01:16:15.090 --> 01:16:20.364
LIAM: I think we'll probably going to get a room
somewhere here. Is this place an inn or a tavern?

01:16:20.364 --> 01:16:22.042
I did not even look coming in.

01:16:22.042 --> 01:16:25.743
MATT: Glancing now, looking through the back,
there is this staircase that winds up to a

01:16:25.743 --> 01:16:29.475
secondary floor and it looks like there probably
is lodging.

01:16:29.475 --> 01:16:32.691
LIAM: Did Avantika leave or did she go up?

01:16:32.691 --> 01:16:35.855
MATT: Avantika left for the moment.

01:16:36.145 --> 01:16:38.166
TALIESIN: I'll have to secure the things--

01:16:38.166 --> 01:16:40.608
LIAM: Probably to shit in an alleyway.

01:16:40.608 --> 01:16:42.112
TRAVIS: You're up front, right?

01:16:42.112 --> 01:16:44.251
TALIESIN: I'm sitting out front. I'm doing the
door.

01:16:44.251 --> 01:16:46.227
MATT: What are you guys doing?

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:48.920
LAURA: I guess just sitting in here for a while.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.934
MATT: Caleb?

01:16:49.934 --> 01:16:51.336
LIAM: Just drinking until--

01:16:51.336 --> 01:16:57.169
TRAVIS: I put my hand on Caduceus' shoulder. How
you doing?

01:16:57.169 --> 01:17:02.935
TALIESIN: I think I'm doing all right. I'm just
contemplating where we're going from here.

01:17:02.935 --> 01:17:08.248
TRAVIS: You seemed a little more at ease. I'll
lean in a little bit.

01:17:08.248 --> 01:17:10.843
TALIESIN: I am a little more at ease.

01:17:10.843 --> 01:17:20.549
TRAVIS: You do much drinking in there? I'm not
really getting the fumes on your breath.

01:17:20.549 --> 01:17:23.851
TALIESIN: I've only gotten drunk once in my life.

01:17:23.851 --> 01:17:25.222
TRAVIS: Really?

01:17:25.222 --> 01:17:28.014
TALIESIN: And that was because of Nott.

01:17:28.014 --> 01:17:30.969
TRAVIS: Is there a reason for that?

01:17:30.969 --> 01:17:34.714
TALIESIN: I thought I'd try. It didn't agree with
me.

01:17:34.714 --> 01:17:38.838
TRAVIS: What happens when you drink?

01:17:38.838 --> 01:17:44.105
TALIESIN: Everything hurts and it's violently
offensive to the body on every level. That stuff's

01:17:44.105 --> 01:17:49.776
disgusting. Just awful.

01:17:49.776 --> 01:17:53.430
TRAVIS: Did you have stuff in your cup, right? You
don't have to fake it. You can just--

01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:58.444
TALIESIN: Well, it feels polite and not everybody
is as understanding as your friends, you know?

01:17:58.444 --> 01:17:59.846
TRAVIS: Right.

01:17:59.846 --> 01:18:05.230
TALIESIN: I just sit in the corner and I listen to
everything that I can for as long as I can and it

01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:10.734
got a little noisy in there and thought I'd get a
little air.

01:18:10.734 --> 01:18:13.171
TRAVIS: Anything popping up on that special radar
of yours?

01:18:13.171 --> 01:18:20.063
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. This place is dangerous. She's
dangerous.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:26.511
TRAVIS: Yeah. That she is. Should we grab the
others and go explore for a bit?

01:18:26.511 --> 01:18:33.798
TALIESIN: I think that's a good idea. And Fjord?
You know why everybody's doing this. Why we're all

01:18:33.798 --> 01:18:36.684
here, right?

01:18:36.684 --> 01:18:39.113
TRAVIS: Yep. I mean, I think.

01:18:39.113 --> 01:18:45.722
TALIESIN: I think you know it. I just want to
point it because that woman, she doesn't care what

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:53.295
any of us want. I'm sure she'd be interested, but
it's way low on her priorities and I don't trust

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:59.085
anybody who puts other people's needs that low on
the list, and you should keep mind of that while

01:18:59.085 --> 01:19:03.163
you're getting in bed with them, so to speak.

01:19:03.163 --> 01:19:06.786
TRAVIS: Is anybody out here in earshot?

01:19:06.786 --> 01:19:08.346
MATT: Outside at the moment? No.

01:19:08.346 --> 01:19:09.706
TALIESIN: Nope.

01:19:09.706 --> 01:19:20.985
TRAVIS: Yeah, listen. About that. Let's just keep
it right between the amigos, all right? Just because--

01:19:20.985 --> 01:19:23.119
TALIESIN: What part of the body is the amigos?

01:19:23.119 --> 01:19:28.243
TRAVIS: No. That's us, right? One amigo, two
amigo. You and I are amigos.

01:19:28.243 --> 01:19:30.999
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:19:31.093 --> 01:19:36.023
TRAVIS: It'll be our thing. Like we're bunkees. We
share--

01:19:36.023 --> 01:19:37.768
TALIESIN: Amigos. We share amigos.

01:19:37.768 --> 01:19:41.386
TRAVIS: No. We're not going to share amigos. We
are the amigos.

01:19:41.386 --> 01:19:43.347
TALIESIN: That's even better.

01:19:43.347 --> 01:19:45.862
TRAVIS: Sharing amigos is a whole other-- yeah.

01:19:45.936 --> 01:19:56.720
TALIESIN: I think I get it. I'm not going to talk
out of turn and I trust your intentions, so--

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:01.465
TRAVIS: Well, actually, that's kind of what I
wanted to talk to you about. You're real good at

01:20:01.465 --> 01:20:04.248
picking up on little things, yeah?

01:20:04.248 --> 01:20:07.014
TALIESIN: You're asking if I can tell you're
conflicted?

01:20:07.014 --> 01:20:09.499
TRAVIS: Heh, no, I think that's pretty clear.

01:20:09.499 --> 01:20:10.984
TALIESIN: You'd be amazed, but all right.

01:20:10.984 --> 01:20:17.941
TRAVIS: I'm just letting you know I'm trying to
keep her close. I feel like this whole thing's

01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:24.583
getting a little out of sorts and the best way to
keep a small finger on the pulse of things is to--

01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:37.992
TALIESIN: Sure. I'm so glad you put it that way.
You're a good man, Fjord, so be careful, because I

01:20:37.992 --> 01:20:43.407
imagine it's a little out of character being
honest and truthful with somebody in a deceptive

01:20:43.407 --> 01:20:50.429
way. It can muddle a good man up whereas it
doesn't muddle a bad man up.

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:54.652
TRAVIS: Yeah. Haven't been very good at it so
far.

01:20:54.652 --> 01:20:58.632
TALIESIN: That's one of the reasons why I like
you.

01:20:58.632 --> 01:21:00.732
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:21:00.732 --> 01:21:05.662
TALIESIN: Here for you, man. I've been learning to
swim.

01:21:05.662 --> 01:21:08.942
TRAVIS: Yeah, more of that to come. Where's the
rest of these chuckle-fucks?

01:21:08.942 --> 01:21:13.409
TALIESIN: Oh, two are mysteriously vanished. I
think they were mumbling something about trying to

01:21:13.409 --> 01:21:15.266
find an alley--

01:21:15.266 --> 01:21:18.142
MARISHA: Nott, will you stand guard now, because
now I have to take a shit.

01:21:18.142 --> 01:21:19.809
SAM: Okay.

01:21:19.809 --> 01:21:21.876
MARISHA: It's been that long.

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:29.210
MATT: For the record, you guys do wait for about
an hour and a half, two hours-- no sign of Allison.

01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:31.057
SAM: Do you think we should go back in?

01:21:31.057 --> 01:21:34.110
TALIESIN: We don't take that long, I think 30
minutes is--

01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:38.558
MATT: Right, I'm just letting them know. That's
how long they would wait before they know that she

01:21:38.558 --> 01:21:39.844
that she's not coming.

01:21:39.844 --> 01:21:42.217
SAM: All right, I guess we'll go back inside,
then?

01:21:42.217 --> 01:21:44.186
MARISHA: Two more minutes.

01:21:44.186 --> 01:21:50.621
SAM: Sure. Do your business. What--

01:21:50.621 --> 01:21:53.598
TRAVIS: Head down, huh? Contemplation.

01:21:53.598 --> 01:22:01.174
SAM: What do you think of our pirate vessel so
far, of our pirate mission? Are you having fun?

01:22:01.174 --> 01:22:05.196
LIAM: If ever you're going to squat on that chair
in a perch, this is it.

01:22:05.196 --> 01:22:11.729
(laughter)

01:22:11.729 --> 01:22:13.424
MARISHA: Okay, what was your question?

01:22:13.424 --> 01:22:14.523
SAM: Nothing, we can go back in--

01:22:14.523 --> 01:22:15.807
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

01:22:15.807 --> 01:22:19.470
TALIESIN: Release.

01:22:19.993 --> 01:22:25.109
MATT: You all make your way, gathering once more
in The Bloated Cup.

01:22:25.109 --> 01:22:32.165
(laughter)

01:22:32.165 --> 01:22:36.076
TALIESIN: That's where you're supposed to go,
god!

01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:42.387
MATT: Right back around. Oh, man.

01:22:42.387 --> 01:22:46.400
TALIESIN: I love you so much. You give so much.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:53.217
(laughter)

01:22:53.217 --> 01:22:55.907
MATT: All right, so what do you guys do?

01:22:55.907 --> 01:22:57.710
TALIESIN: I want to take a night walk.

01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:59.982
MARISHA: Night walk! Night hike.

01:22:59.982 --> 01:23:02.270
TRAVIS: (singing) I want to take a night walk--
that's not a song.

01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:03.672
LAURA: All of us together?

01:23:03.672 --> 01:23:06.028
SAM: Yeah, let's go for a walk.

01:23:06.028 --> 01:23:11.052
TRAVIS: We'll poke our heads back in and go--
We'll wave them out.

01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:16.840
TALIESIN: The crew should also have some place to
sleep. Let's make sure everybody is taken care of.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.228
SAM: They can go back to the boat, right?

01:23:18.228 --> 01:23:20.524
TALIESIN: They're having a bad time-- what do you
guys want?

01:23:20.524 --> 01:23:27.535
MATT: Orly seems to be playing the mother hen with
Marius playing assistant to that.

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:31.169
TALIESIN: Mr. Orly, we feel terrible about
everything that's going on. We want to make you

01:23:31.169 --> 01:23:35.919
guys as comfortable as possible through this
deeply inconvenient situation we've all found

01:23:35.919 --> 01:23:38.046
ourselves in.

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:43.041
MATT: "I would be lying if it wasn't deeply
inconvenient."

01:23:43.041 --> 01:23:46.799
TALIESIN: Appreciate your honesty.

01:23:47.492 --> 01:23:50.458
TRAVIS: (whispering) Ask him about the Diver's
Grave.

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:52.041
TALIESIN: What would not be an insult--

01:23:52.041 --> 01:23:53.482
LAURA: I hit his hand. High five!

01:23:53.482 --> 01:23:59.379
TALIESIN: Like that-- I know that would be an
insult-- but what would not be an-- How many kids

01:23:59.379 --> 01:24:02.143
are here?

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:14.451
MATT: "If we're staying behind, I'd say give me
about a hundred gold to watch over the nest around

01:24:14.451 --> 01:24:26.224
"here. When you return, we'll hopefully-- I
understand, perhaps, you m-m-might be coming back

01:24:26.224 --> 01:24:28.709
"for us?"

01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:32.054
TALIESIN: Without question.

01:24:32.054 --> 01:24:37.555
MATT: "Then I'll return whatever was not spent."

01:24:37.555 --> 01:24:39.195
TALIESIN: That's a good idea.

01:24:39.195 --> 01:24:40.458
MARISHA: I've got 50 gold on that.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:41.227
TRAVIS: I'll get the other 50.

01:24:41.227 --> 01:24:46.645
TALIESIN: Thank you, kids. We are-- unless
something goes tragically wrong-- we expect to be

01:24:46.645 --> 01:24:51.908
returning, and I imagine you'll hear word if
things go tragically wrong.

01:24:51.908 --> 01:24:57.277
MATT: Marius comes over and goes, "Right, now,
hoping no tragedy, just come back and get us off

01:24:57.277 --> 01:24:58.975
"this fucking hell-hole."

01:24:58.975 --> 01:25:04.522
LAURA: Well, if we don't come back, can't you take
the Mistake and go home?

01:25:04.522 --> 01:25:06.890
MATT: "If you don't come back, I don't know."

01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:09.600
TALIESIN: How long do we expect to be gone for?

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:16.738
MATT: Travel from here to there and back, about
four or five days round.

01:25:16.738 --> 01:25:18.841
LAURA: Two weeks, if we're not back in two
weeks--

01:25:18.841 --> 01:25:21.422
TALIESIN: If it's two weeks, the ship is yours.

01:25:21.422 --> 01:25:32.272
MATT: "All right. Well, I wish you all m-m-much
luck."

01:25:32.272 --> 01:25:37.732
TALIESIN: I appreciate that. Hopefully you will
not have to play a funeral dirge for us.

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:48.186
MATT: "I am hoping that is never the case. Guess
I'll just make some coin in the interim."

01:25:48.186 --> 01:25:49.405
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:25:49.405 --> 01:25:55.860
TRAVIS: If I may, Orly, you seem to be very
familiar with the Diver's Grave and the song. Do

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:59.170
you know anything more specific of it and
creatures that might be in that area? Things to

01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:00.721
look out for?

01:26:00.721 --> 01:26:04.904
MATT: "I mean, standard deep-ocean folk."

01:26:04.904 --> 01:26:06.788
TRAVIS: Deep-ocean folk?

01:26:06.788 --> 01:26:08.859
MATT: "Sharks."

01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:10.814
MARISHA: (whispering) Mermaids.

01:26:10.814 --> 01:26:12.924
MATT: "Other underwater beasts."

01:26:12.924 --> 01:26:14.350
TALIESIN: What's a mermaid?

01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:22.912
MATT: "Perhaps m-m-mermaids and other such
dangers."

01:26:22.912 --> 01:26:26.656
TALIESIN: How many teeth does a mermaid have--?
What is that?

01:26:26.656 --> 01:26:30.900
LAURA: Mermaids are part pretty people and part
fish people.

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.779
TALIESIN: Those are both very dangerous.

01:26:32.779 --> 01:26:36.340
LAURA: Well! Yeah.

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:41.978
TRAVIS: Any good things about the area that you
care to share?

01:26:41.978 --> 01:26:49.486
MATT: "Probably some worthwhile loot there amongst
the sediment."

01:26:49.486 --> 01:26:50.846
TRAVIS: Right.

01:26:50.846 --> 01:26:57.597
TALIESIN: Any idea how long ships have been going
down in that region?

01:26:57.597 --> 01:27:01.476
MATT: "Oh, a few hundred years, maybe?"

01:27:01.476 --> 01:27:06.447
LIAM: A few hundred years? Is there some sort of
weather pattern or natural phenomenon that is

01:27:06.447 --> 01:27:07.555
responsible for this?

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:11.303
MATT: "No, ships go down all over the coast."

01:27:11.303 --> 01:27:16.752
LIAM: But there aren't creepy stories about every
inch of it, is there?

01:27:16.752 --> 01:27:22.408
MATT: "There are quite a number of creepy stories
on every part of this here coast."

01:27:22.408 --> 01:27:25.179
LIAM: Fair point.

01:27:25.179 --> 01:27:30.360
SAM: Do you know how deep it is to the bottom
there? Is it deep, deep ocean, or just medium-ocean?

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.665
MATT: "Can't say I do."

01:27:31.665 --> 01:27:32.525
SAM: All right.

01:27:32.525 --> 01:27:36.280
MATT: "M-m-my apologies."

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.605
TALIESIN: Thank you for your time, and thank you
for your trust.

01:27:39.605 --> 01:27:41.653
MATT: "Come back."

01:27:41.653 --> 01:27:44.165
TALIESIN: Working on it.

01:27:44.165 --> 01:27:46.233
TRAVIS: All right, who are we missing?

01:27:46.233 --> 01:27:48.652
MARISHA: Night hike. We're all here.

01:27:48.652 --> 01:27:50.839
TRAVIS: Why are you guys wiping your hands on your
pants?

01:27:50.839 --> 01:27:52.108
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

01:27:52.108 --> 01:27:53.422
SAM: It's fine.

01:27:53.422 --> 01:27:57.365
TRAVIS: Okay. Who wants to go explore?

01:27:57.365 --> 01:27:59.411
LAURA: Let's go.

01:27:59.411 --> 01:28:01.874
SAM: Let's go explore!

01:28:01.874 --> 01:28:05.531
LIAM: What are we looking for? Are we just taking
it in?

01:28:05.531 --> 01:28:07.969
MARISHA: We're looking for fresh air.

01:28:07.969 --> 01:28:12.276
TRAVIS: Yeah, I figured we'll use the night air to
our advantage, acclimate a little bit.

01:28:12.276 --> 01:28:15.531
TALIESIN: Let's take a walk. Let's see what there
is to see. I'm excited about this.

01:28:15.531 --> 01:28:16.713
LIAM: Learn the city.

01:28:16.713 --> 01:28:17.426
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:28:17.426 --> 01:28:23.162
MATT: Yasha leans in and goes, "If there is any
trouble, should I...?"

01:28:23.162 --> 01:28:29.296
TRAVIS: Oh, if there is trouble, let's try and
resolve it-- well...

01:28:29.296 --> 01:28:31.823
MATT: "I trust you, just--"

01:28:31.823 --> 01:28:33.483
MARISHA: Gauge it as it comes?

01:28:33.483 --> 01:28:34.396
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:28:34.396 --> 01:28:36.096
MATT: "Tell me when you want--"

01:28:36.096 --> 01:28:42.595
TRAVIS: The Judge? Will do. It's so intimidating
when she says it like that.

01:28:42.595 --> 01:28:43.504
MARISHA: It is.

01:28:43.504 --> 01:28:46.717
LAURA: Can I have taken, I'm assuming, a short
rest and heal up from my fight while we were all

01:28:46.717 --> 01:28:47.910
chilling here?

01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:48.453
MATT: Sure.

01:28:48.453 --> 01:28:51.838
MARISHA: We should get a wig for the Judge like
the Plank King has.

01:28:51.838 --> 01:28:53.012
TRAVIS: For the sword?

01:28:53.012 --> 01:28:53.637
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:28:53.637 --> 01:28:54.879
TRAVIS and LIAM: A wig?

01:28:54.879 --> 01:28:56.796
MARISHA: Just throwing it out there.

01:28:56.796 --> 01:29:00.405
SAM: Sort of like a golf club cover?

01:29:00.405 --> 01:29:03.846
TALIESIN: Like a tea-cozy. A sword-cozy.

01:29:05.053 --> 01:29:08.175
MATT: Okay. You guys leave the tavern.

01:29:08.175 --> 01:29:13.279
TRAVIS: Up away from the docks.

01:29:13.279 --> 01:29:18.838
MATT: Okay. As you exit-- Caduceus, you notice
this-- but Jester, as everyone's leaving, you to

01:29:18.913 --> 01:29:25.273
the back of it, you feel a hand grab your arm for
a minute. You look over to the side, and you may

01:29:25.273 --> 01:29:32.507
not have noticed earlier, but Vera had been in the
inn, in the tavern vicinity. She pulls you back

01:29:32.507 --> 01:29:36.126
from the rest of the group for a second and looks
you in the eye with this intense stare. You can

01:29:36.126 --> 01:29:42.851
see the wrinkles on the sides of her face pushing
into this tight crow's nest on each side, her

01:29:42.851 --> 01:29:51.314
irises bloodshot. She goes, "He would not be the
first she's left in ruin, and he would not be the

01:29:51.314 --> 01:30:04.465
"last. I will take care of him if he cannot." She
releases you and spins around and walks off to her room.

01:30:04.465 --> 01:30:08.919
TALIESIN: I caught a bit of that, right?

01:30:08.919 --> 01:30:14.536
MATT: You saw them discuss, but you weren't-- At
the point of talking and looking, you wouldn't

01:30:14.536 --> 01:30:17.717
have made out the words necessarily.

01:30:17.717 --> 01:30:19.502
LAURA: (whispering) Whoa.

01:30:20.939 --> 01:30:27.154
MATT: You guys are here in the open night air.
You're pushing midnight, here at Darktow.

01:30:27.154 --> 01:30:29.878
LAURA: It smells like poop out here!

01:30:29.878 --> 01:30:35.759
TRAVIS: Checking the bottom of my shoes, like:
What did we step in? Why is it--?

01:30:35.759 --> 01:30:39.855
SAM: The sea breeze. At night, it's a
land-breeze.

01:30:39.855 --> 01:30:42.106
TALIESIN: Actually, I have to stop really quickly
and use the bathroom. There's these little

01:30:42.106 --> 01:30:47.207
outhouses over in the corner right here that drop
straight down into the--

01:30:47.207 --> 01:30:49.777
TRAVIS: Outhouse, campaign two. Here we go.

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:52.521
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's like the tower bridge.

01:30:52.521 --> 01:30:54.029
SAM: Is anyone on the streets?

01:30:54.029 --> 01:30:55.259
LIAM: Ja, and how well-lit is it out here?

01:30:55.259 --> 01:30:56.612
MARISHA: Yeah, who's watching?

01:30:56.612 --> 01:31:02.778
MATT: It's pretty misty. There are not heavy
clouds in the sky, and the moon seems to be not a

01:31:02.778 --> 01:31:08.610
full moon, but it seems to be fairly bright, but
because of the mist, it diffuses. There is this

01:31:08.610 --> 01:31:14.056
general faint moonlight throughout the entire
vicinity of the town. What that does is it makes

01:31:14.056 --> 01:31:22.905
distant visibility a little harder, much like fog
lights at a distance. There are a number of

01:31:22.905 --> 01:31:29.436
patrolling individuals-- no uniform to them, but
they walk around, torch in hand, looking through

01:31:29.436 --> 01:31:37.115
the streets, keeping an eye. They're armed,
armored, but haphazard and no uniform.

01:31:37.515 --> 01:31:39.240
MARISHA: This is the Revelry?

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:42.894
MATT: Everyone here seems to be a part of the
Revelry-- including yourselves now.

01:31:42.894 --> 01:31:46.285
LAURA: Keep your hands on your coin purses.

01:31:46.285 --> 01:31:52.734
SAM: Okay, if we're going to talk about these
things, let's use some code words. Don't say her

01:31:52.734 --> 01:31:55.366
name, say a different name.

01:31:55.366 --> 01:31:56.391
TRAVIS: Like?

01:31:56.391 --> 01:31:57.417
LAURA: Tiffany.

01:31:57.417 --> 01:31:59.189
SAM: Yes, Tiffany.

01:31:59.189 --> 01:32:01.729
MARISHA: She's kind of like a Tiffany.

01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:04.658
TRAVIS: Okay, Tiffany. And?

01:32:04.658 --> 01:32:06.388
SAM: The name of the ship.

01:32:06.388 --> 01:32:07.885
TRAVIS: Which ship?

01:32:07.885 --> 01:32:10.231
SAM: Tiffany's ship.

01:32:10.231 --> 01:32:12.068
LAURA: That's the name: Tiffany's Ship.

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:15.281
SAM: Tiffany's Ship is the name of Tiffany's
ship.

01:32:15.281 --> 01:32:17.862
MARISHA: That makes it clear.

01:32:17.862 --> 01:32:20.722
TRAVIS: How will they crack this if they hear us?

01:32:20.722 --> 01:32:23.702
SAM: That's all the code we need, all right.

01:32:23.702 --> 01:32:25.683
TRAVIS: How do we reference the--?

01:32:25.683 --> 01:32:28.617
MARISHA: We call it the--

01:32:28.617 --> 01:32:30.861
TRAVIS: The Apricot.

01:32:30.861 --> 01:32:32.721
SAM: The Apricot.

01:32:32.721 --> 01:32:34.964
MARISHA: The Apricot.

01:32:34.964 --> 01:32:36.853
SAM: Anything else before we get into this?

01:32:36.853 --> 01:32:44.431
MARISHA: Wait, is the Apricot this, or is the
Apricot the tiny Tiffany Ship?

01:32:44.431 --> 01:32:45.857
TRAVIS: Nope, it's this.

01:32:45.857 --> 01:32:47.023
MARISHA: It's this, okay.

01:32:47.023 --> 01:32:51.221
LAURA: Your heart? The Apricot is your heart?

01:32:51.221 --> 01:32:52.479
TRAVIS: Say that again?

01:32:52.479 --> 01:32:54.411
TALIESIN: It's the tip of the tiny Tiffany Ship.

01:32:54.411 --> 01:32:59.344
SAM: All right, so, how will we deal with
Tiffany?

01:32:59.344 --> 01:33:00.732
MARISHA: Holy shit!

01:33:00.732 --> 01:33:02.480
TALIESIN: Which one's Tiffany?

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.551
TRAVIS: Let's walk-and-talk about Tiffany.

01:33:04.551 --> 01:33:05.925
SAM: Of course we're walking-and-talking.

01:33:05.925 --> 01:33:09.248
MARISHA: I'm keeping an eye open for every
suspicious-looking asshole.

01:33:09.248 --> 01:33:12.139
LAURA: Tiffany can be invisible though, you guys.

01:33:12.139 --> 01:33:13.671
SAM: Everyone do this.

01:33:13.671 --> 01:33:15.289
TRAVIS: Tiffany doesn't know that we're talking
about her.

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:17.361
SAM: She went to bed, she's fine.

01:33:17.361 --> 01:33:21.776
LAURA: I'm going to keep an eye out to see if the
mist ever parts around us.

01:33:21.776 --> 01:33:26.366
MATT: Okay. Both you and Beau make perception
checks, please, since you're both keeping eyes out.

01:33:26.366 --> 01:33:27.291
TRAVIS: Come on!

01:33:27.291 --> 01:33:32.277
SAM: She won't know we're talking about her
because we're using a new name, Tiffany, so she's

01:33:32.277 --> 01:33:34.052
not even going to know.

01:33:34.052 --> 01:33:36.007
TALIESIN: 26.

01:33:36.007 --> 01:33:43.686
MATT: Okay. You're keeping a gauge on any of the
wandering, patrolling guards to make sure as to

01:33:43.686 --> 01:33:49.530
not to speak too loudly or in the presence of
anyone; conversation either shifting temporarily

01:33:49.530 --> 01:33:54.395
or coming to a lull and walking by in silence, but
you manage to snake your way through a relatively

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:59.526
quiet town beyond the various taverns this late at
night.

01:33:59.526 --> 01:34:02.619
TRAVIS: A lot of store fronts and things that are
closed up for the night.

01:34:02.619 --> 01:34:05.976
MATT: You do wander through what you assume to be
the Sundry Square eventually, through this

01:34:05.976 --> 01:34:13.637
wandering. There is a makeshift pavilion where
it's dotted with tables and crates under ratty

01:34:13.637 --> 01:34:18.913
awnings and canopies, but it's all closed and
dark. There's no lights. It looks like none of the

01:34:18.913 --> 01:34:25.180
materials for sale are left behind. It's mainly
just a structure and materials are probably

01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:29.174
brought there in the morning and are placed out
for trade, sell, or whatever.

01:34:29.174 --> 01:34:32.439
LAURA: Don't you think it's weird that someone
would be a pirate and they would come here because

01:34:32.439 --> 01:34:37.601
they were a pirate and then they change their mind
and decide to be a shopkeeper here instead?

01:34:37.601 --> 01:34:41.213
TRAVIS: No. Maybe they were looking for a new
environment and they found exactly what they were

01:34:41.213 --> 01:34:42.229
looking for.

01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:45.362
LIAM: Maybe they thought they were tough and
strong, and they were not as tough and strong as

01:34:45.362 --> 01:34:47.523
they thought, so now they sell rope.

01:34:47.523 --> 01:34:48.692
MATT: Make a history check.

01:34:48.692 --> 01:34:52.550
MARISHA: It feels like a farmer's market. It feels
like certain people sell things whenever they got them.

01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:55.090
TRAVIS: Ooh, natural 17, for 19.

01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:56.529
LIAM: 12.

01:34:56.529 --> 01:35:04.668
MATT: You do know Darktow, before it was taken by
pirates about 45 years or so beforehand, it was

01:35:04.668 --> 01:35:11.282
just another city of the Clovis Concord. It
belonged to the Menagerie Coast, and it was one of

01:35:11.282 --> 01:35:16.491
the central port stops for a lot of the trade
routes making their way to the coast. Then it was

01:35:16.491 --> 01:35:23.408
taken by the Revelry, and they reinforced it and
made it defensible. They didn't slaughter everyone

01:35:23.408 --> 01:35:27.282
there, because they weren't there to kill
everyone. They were there to take it over. They

01:35:27.282 --> 01:35:34.095
killed those who were, in their opinion,
incorrectly placed in charge, any dissenters, and

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:39.003
then anybody who agreed to join the Revelry, "Join
or Die" type circumstance, everyone who had

01:35:39.003 --> 01:35:42.596
previously been at the island were absorbed into
the Revelry. Some of them have continued their

01:35:42.596 --> 01:35:49.284
life there, some of them, their bloodline has
continued to be those that maintain other forms of

01:35:49.284 --> 01:35:55.289
business. Not everyone is technically a pirate;
there are a lot of members of the Revelry that are

01:35:55.289 --> 01:35:57.731
just civilians of Darktow and maintain the
island.

01:35:57.731 --> 01:35:59.414
TRAVIS: There was a lot of assimilation here.

01:35:59.414 --> 01:36:00.318
TALIESIN: Like Orlando.

01:36:00.318 --> 01:36:02.519
MATT: (laughs) Sure!

01:36:02.519 --> 01:36:04.668
(laughter)

01:36:04.668 --> 01:36:07.036
TALIESIN: Not everyone's a retired person or a
college student. Somebody's got to actually clean

01:36:07.036 --> 01:36:08.311
that place up.

01:36:08.311 --> 01:36:10.959
(laughter)

01:36:10.959 --> 01:36:12.165
SAM: We love you, Orlando.

01:36:12.165 --> 01:36:13.035
MATT: Yes.

01:36:13.035 --> 01:36:14.220
TALIESIN: I really do. I have plans.

01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:16.990
(laughter)

01:36:17.175 --> 01:36:19.590
MATT: Hear that? Taliesin has plans for you,
Orlando.

01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:21.488
TALIESIN: Deep plans.

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:25.605
SAM: If I may?

01:36:25.612 --> 01:36:26.606
MARISHA: Okay.

01:36:26.606 --> 01:36:28.282
SAM: Here's our options.

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:29.339
TRAVIS: Here it is.

01:36:29.339 --> 01:36:30.665
MARISHA: Do you have a powerpoint?

01:36:30.665 --> 01:36:34.647
SAM: I don't, but I've been thinking about
things.

01:36:34.647 --> 01:36:36.164
TRAVIS: How drunk are you?

01:36:36.164 --> 01:36:44.291
SAM: I'm lit. I'm tight, but feeling good.

01:36:44.291 --> 01:36:45.723
TALIESIN: Amigo.

01:36:45.723 --> 01:36:53.390
SAM: Our intent is to get off this island without
Tiffany, correct?

01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:59.226
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Well, I think it's less about
getting off this island without Tiffany and more

01:36:59.226 --> 01:37:03.019
about getting to that shipwreck first, before
her.

01:37:03.019 --> 01:37:08.077
TRAVIS: I think that's the highest priority. The
only thing that we haven't discerned from Tiffany

01:37:08.077 --> 01:37:11.729
is if she knows where the next--

01:37:11.729 --> 01:37:13.301
SAM: Apricot?

01:37:13.301 --> 01:37:19.734
TRAVIS: No, we know where the apricot might be,
where the next apricot tree might be.

01:37:19.734 --> 01:37:22.310
SAM: Fruit stand? Apricot tree.

01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:24.283
TRAVIS: Or fruit stand. I like it.

01:37:24.283 --> 01:37:32.458
SAM: Here's our options. I'm just putting them out
there. I put no weight on any of them. We can

01:37:32.458 --> 01:37:40.512
follow Tiffany tomorrow as she goes about her day.
We can get in touch with this Allison person,

01:37:40.512 --> 01:37:42.581
follow her--

01:37:42.581 --> 01:37:43.213
MARISHA: Bitch.

01:37:43.213 --> 01:37:44.581
SAM: I know, right?

01:37:44.581 --> 01:37:46.481
(laughter)

01:37:46.481 --> 01:37:49.283
TRAVIS: Well, if you used her right name.

01:37:49.283 --> 01:37:55.759
SAM: We could talk to some of Tiffany's crew,
right? Bouldergut seems dumb.

01:37:55.759 --> 01:37:57.865
LAURA: You shouldn't use her real name.

01:37:57.865 --> 01:37:59.104
TRAVIS: Yeah, wow.

01:37:59.104 --> 01:38:03.094
SAM: Sorry. Franklin Delano Roosevelt seems dumb.

01:38:03.094 --> 01:38:06.898
(laughter)

01:38:06.898 --> 01:38:12.575
SAM: Also the former quartermaster, Theodore
Roosevelt.

01:38:12.575 --> 01:38:16.814
(laughter)

01:38:16.814 --> 01:38:25.382
SAM: Then, there's this Sorris fellow. I don't
know, he didn't seem like he's be a font of any knowledge.

01:38:25.382 --> 01:38:26.676
LAURA: I like him.

01:38:26.676 --> 01:38:32.172
SAM: We can sabotage Tiffany's ship. I don't know
what that would do because we need it to get off

01:38:32.172 --> 01:38:41.682
the island. We could frame Tiffany for some crime
against another pirate! We have a signature from

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:47.723
Tiffany in a letter that she wrote. We have-- that
is all that we have.

01:38:47.723 --> 01:38:55.296
MARISHA: Well, she's not currently at her ship.
I'm assuming a lot of her valuable information is

01:38:55.379 --> 01:39:04.044
locked away in her captain's quarters somewhere on
Tiffany's ship. If we can get the information to

01:39:04.044 --> 01:39:12.515
the next apricot tree, then do we need Tiffany
anymore?

01:39:12.515 --> 01:39:15.111
LAURA: I just remembered.

01:39:15.111 --> 01:39:16.551
SAM: What?

01:39:16.551 --> 01:39:24.612
LAURA: Well, I have this new spell that the
Traveler was telling me about. It lets you pop in

01:39:24.612 --> 01:39:37.024
somewhere. You can just pop in and then you can
bring somebody with you. It's like a doorway.

01:39:37.024 --> 01:39:40.109
SAM: You could pop in where? To her ship? To her
captain's quarters?

01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:41.712
LAURA: I would pop into her office.

01:39:41.712 --> 01:39:44.041
SAM: On the ship? On the Tiffany ship?

01:39:44.041 --> 01:39:45.177
MARISHA: How far?

01:39:45.177 --> 01:39:46.701
LIAM: How far away can you do a pop-in?

01:39:46.701 --> 01:39:53.271
LAURA: That's a really good question! Let me think
about it. Hey, Traveler, how far away can I use

01:39:53.271 --> 01:39:57.038
this spell? 500 whole feet, he says!

01:39:57.038 --> 01:39:58.079
SAM: That's a lot.

01:39:58.079 --> 01:40:04.496
MARISHA: That's a lot of feet. So many feet. Look,
if I've learned anything about important people,

01:40:04.496 --> 01:40:13.149
it's that they can't resist putting shit down on
paper. I guarantee you, there's something in her office.

01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:17.072
LAURA: I don't know how we would get out of it
once I was in there though, because I can only use

01:40:17.072 --> 01:40:19.497
it once but I suppose--

01:40:19.497 --> 01:40:20.735
SAM: You can just leave.

01:40:20.735 --> 01:40:24.226
LAURA: Yeah, but wouldn't somebody be keeping
watch on the ship, though?

01:40:24.226 --> 01:40:26.065
SAM: But it's our ship, we work on the ship.

01:40:26.065 --> 01:40:31.006
MARISHA: Do we have credentials? Do we have like,
badges? Like beep-beep?

01:40:31.006 --> 01:40:31.880
MATT: No.

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:36.235
TRAVIS: Well, I can tell you that her quarters
have a balcony.

01:40:36.235 --> 01:40:37.652
MARISHA: Oh, can you?

01:40:37.652 --> 01:40:41.314
LIAM: We could also potentially send Frumpkin with
a note or letter.

01:40:41.314 --> 01:40:42.595
LAURA: And do what?

01:40:42.595 --> 01:40:44.060
LIAM: Leave it.

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:45.682
SAM: You mean like plant something?

01:40:45.682 --> 01:40:47.807
MARISHA: No, I want to get something.

01:40:47.807 --> 01:40:49.614
SAM: Rifle through her stuff.

01:40:49.614 --> 01:40:55.434
TRAVIS: Yeah, because if we are planning to leave
without her, that means she'll give chase-- I

01:40:55.434 --> 01:41:00.266
mean, I hate to even suggest it, but I'd rather
not have someone hot on our tail.

01:41:00.266 --> 01:41:04.972
LIAM: Also, this leads me to a question I have
which is, instead of discussing the short term

01:41:04.972 --> 01:41:11.750
which we want to do, I want to ask you about the
long term. If we ditch Tiffany, and we find the

01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:21.375
apricot tree, what happens then? Like, what is
your plan with this apricot? I think we have ideas

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:27.927
about what could come from it. She's done what she
did at the first tree and you got the next tree,

01:41:27.927 --> 01:41:33.992
and maybe she races to the-- What happens next,
Fjord? Like, I know you are curious, but what is

01:41:33.992 --> 01:41:35.229
the plan?

01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:38.051
LAURA: Should we be using your name or should we
call you something else right now too?

01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:39.160
MARISHA: Tusktooth?

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.004
LIAM: We'll call him Honda.

01:41:41.004 --> 01:41:42.827
MARISHA: So many nicknames.

01:41:42.827 --> 01:41:45.298
TALIESIN: I'm lost.

01:41:45.298 --> 01:41:54.052
TRAVIS: Well, as Honda, I would race to the
apricot and seize it so that she can't pick that

01:41:54.052 --> 01:42:01.282
fruit. Keep it for ourselves in our fruit basket,
and make off and decide if we're going to make

01:42:01.282 --> 01:42:03.968
marmalade later or not.

01:42:03.968 --> 01:42:05.036
TALIESIN: I like marmalade.

01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:09.919
LIAM: Do you know how, at the first tree, an
apricot was picked and things shook, something

01:42:09.919 --> 01:42:17.229
happened there. This place was all about drei,
the number three, so you want to go pluck another

01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:23.471
fruit and that's two out of three and what happens
once the third--

01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:26.635
TRAVIS: We actually don't know where the other
tree is yet, that's the thing. We just know where

01:42:26.635 --> 01:42:27.899
the fruit is.

01:42:27.899 --> 01:42:38.867
MARISHA: Personally, I feel more comfortable with
Honda controlling the supply of apricots than Tiffany.

01:42:38.867 --> 01:42:41.006
TRAVIS: They're in season right now.

01:42:41.006 --> 01:42:48.063
LIAM: I am not telling any of you, especially you,
what to do here, but an alternative plan is to get

01:42:48.063 --> 01:42:54.358
rid of anyone who knows about the location of the
tree and bury the tree.

01:42:56.722 --> 01:42:59.689
MARISHA: The tree we just came from or the tree
that we're going to?

01:42:59.689 --> 01:43:07.421
TRAVIS: If we do that, we might need to ask
Tiffany if she knows the location of the tree

01:43:07.421 --> 01:43:09.766
because it hasn't been brought up as of yet.

01:43:09.766 --> 01:43:17.198
MARISHA: Fuck asking Tiffany any questions. We
break into Breakfast at Tiffany's and get the

01:43:17.198 --> 01:43:19.133
information that we need.

01:43:19.133 --> 01:43:20.858
TALIESIN: That was a long walk.

01:43:20.858 --> 01:43:26.795
TRAVIS: It was a long walk, but we're all on the
same page. Okay, are we up for a little B&amp;amp;E?

01:43:26.795 --> 01:43:31.286
MARISHA: Eyy, this is my specialty.

01:43:31.286 --> 01:43:33.486
TRAVIS: In real life or the game?

01:43:33.486 --> 01:43:36.381
MARISHA: No comment. I plead the fifth.

01:43:36.381 --> 01:43:38.979
LAURA: Will we be using the fancy doorway?

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:40.381
MARISHA: I think to get in, yeah.

01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:44.166
TRAVIS: Yeah, absolutely. Don't you have another
way to make a door?

01:43:44.166 --> 01:43:45.937
TALIESIN: That's in an emergency.

01:43:45.937 --> 01:43:47.095
LAURA: Well yes, but that is--

01:43:47.095 --> 01:43:49.465
SAM: That would be permanent.

01:43:49.465 --> 01:43:53.518
LAURA: That's the thing, she would definitely see
there was a new door.

01:43:53.518 --> 01:43:55.600
MARISHA: Also, you said there was a balcony
right?

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.477
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:43:56.477 --> 01:43:59.489
MARISHA: Was there a door to the balcony? Do you
think that would be locked?

01:43:59.489 --> 01:44:02.574
TRAVIS: I mean there was a door-- was it solid
wood or did it have glass?

01:44:02.574 --> 01:44:08.977
MATT: No, it had two glass doorways, like windows,
but they open like doors and latch shut.

01:44:08.977 --> 01:44:15.016
SAM: Wait, if you could get in to her cabin, you
can Disguise Self as well, right? You could change

01:44:15.016 --> 01:44:17.295
yourself to Vera or something?

01:44:17.295 --> 01:44:18.118
MARISHA: Or to Avantika.

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:19.116
SAM: Or to Avantika or Vera?

01:44:19.116 --> 01:44:19.987
MARISHA: I mean Tiffany?

01:44:19.987 --> 01:44:20.805
SAM: Oh shit! Shit!

01:44:20.805 --> 01:44:22.404
MARISHA: Fuck! We were doing so well.

01:44:22.404 --> 01:44:23.388
MATT: Roll initiative!

01:44:23.388 --> 01:44:25.639
MARISHA: Who's here?!

01:44:25.639 --> 01:44:33.525
SAM: You could turn yourself into Franklin Delano
Roosevelt. You could walk off the ship and no one

01:44:33.525 --> 01:44:37.326
would think the wiser, or they might say,
"Franklin Delano Roosevelt! Why are you on

01:44:37.326 --> 01:44:41.966
"Tiffany's ship?" You'd be like, "Bitch, I work
here."

01:44:42.301 --> 01:44:44.000
TALIESIN: Why are there two of you here?

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.508
SAM: I'm Franklin Delano Roosevelt!

01:44:45.508 --> 01:44:49.145
TALIESIN: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and then
you're two people on a ship and you're involved in

01:44:49.145 --> 01:44:54.968
things and-- I mean, it's a good emergency plan,
but can you only go once? You can't go twice?

01:44:54.968 --> 01:44:57.417
LAURA: I can't go twice. I can just do it once.

01:44:57.417 --> 01:45:01.013
LIAM: What if some of us kept Avantika busy?

01:45:01.013 --> 01:45:03.466
LAURA: Tiffany.

01:45:03.466 --> 01:45:06.097
LIAM: This is difficult.

01:45:08.673 --> 01:45:11.255
TALIESIN: A few of us were eating apricots at the
time.

01:45:11.255 --> 01:45:15.900
LIAM: What if Fjord keeps Tiff busy-

01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:17.502
SAM: Honda.

01:45:17.502 --> 01:45:20.960
LIAM: Man, oh man--

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:22.967
LAURA: Honda keeps Tiffany busy.

01:45:22.967 --> 01:45:29.299
LIAM: What if the green guy and the gal are busy,
you follow?

01:45:29.299 --> 01:45:35.165
MARISHA: Do we need to have Honda distract
Tiffany? Can we not do this right now while she's

01:45:35.165 --> 01:45:38.027
theoretically sleeping?

01:45:38.027 --> 01:45:46.000
LIAM: Let me finish the thought. You do that
thing, you take your little doorway over, you do

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:52.913
what you want to do, then poof, you are Tiffany.
You walk off the boat, because Tiffany is busy.

01:45:52.913 --> 01:45:55.296
MARISHA: That's true, he could be accountable.

01:45:55.296 --> 01:45:59.214
LIAM: 100% busy, not maybe busy, maybe she's
sleeping, maybe she's out for a walk.

01:45:59.214 --> 01:46:08.465
MARISHA: For sure busy. We could have this guy
with Frumpkin making sure that they're busy, if

01:46:08.465 --> 01:46:12.831
you're comfortable with that. You don't have a lot
of a choice.

01:46:13.371 --> 01:46:18.805
SAM: Can you keep Tiffany busy for, you know, 15
or 20 minutes?

01:46:25.455 --> 01:46:27.866
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:46:28.325 --> 01:46:38.608
SAM: 25 if you really had to? Take a break?

01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:45.700
TRAVIS: Maybe with a short rest. Maybe.

01:46:48.099 --> 01:46:49.669
LIAM: It's real quiet at this table.

01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:54.719
(laughter)

01:46:55.805 --> 01:47:00.157
SAM: This is a good plan, and we're going to go in
there-- oh, you're going to go in there. Do you

01:47:00.157 --> 01:47:01.667
need some help?

01:47:01.667 --> 01:47:03.380
LAURA: I should bring somebody with me.

01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:05.739
MARISHA: This is my forte, man.

01:47:05.739 --> 01:47:07.091
LAURA: Okay, me and you, Beau.

01:47:07.091 --> 01:47:07.939
MARISHA: Okay.

01:47:07.939 --> 01:47:11.612
SAM: Except Beau can't make herself look like
anything else.

01:47:11.612 --> 01:47:14.831
MARISHA: But if I'm with the queen, then what does
it matter?

01:47:14.831 --> 01:47:16.228
TRAVIS: Who's the queen in this scenario?

01:47:16.228 --> 01:47:17.423
SAM and MARISHA: Tiffany.

01:47:17.423 --> 01:47:18.376
SAM: Fake Tiffany.

01:47:18.376 --> 01:47:22.349
LAURA: You don't want yourself connected with this
at all.

01:47:22.616 --> 01:47:27.303
MARISHA: I could take the-- that's a good point.
Fuck.

01:47:27.303 --> 01:47:32.126
LAURA: Plus, here's the thing. Caduceus is really
perceptive.

01:47:32.126 --> 01:47:35.974
TRAVIS: The two clerics are not going on the
mission together!

01:47:35.974 --> 01:47:37.571
SAM: I can break into things.

01:47:37.602 --> 01:47:38.654
LAURA: That's true.

01:47:38.654 --> 01:47:39.624
TALIESIN: You're very sneaky.

01:47:39.624 --> 01:47:40.392
LIAM: You're small.

01:47:40.392 --> 01:47:41.672
SAM: I can also talk to Caleb.

01:47:41.672 --> 01:47:44.363
LIAM: That's also true.

01:47:44.363 --> 01:47:50.428
MARISHA: How are you going to get off the boat?

01:47:50.428 --> 01:47:53.149
SAM: I can make myself look like something.

01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:55.410
LAURA: That's true, you could be Sorris.

01:47:55.410 --> 01:47:58.485
TRAVIS: Doesn't Ipsis-- small like?

01:47:58.485 --> 01:48:00.857
MATT: Ipess? Ipess is a gnome, yeah.

01:48:00.857 --> 01:48:02.120
SAM: I could be Ipess.

01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:04.331
LAURA: Ipess! That's right!

01:48:04.331 --> 01:48:08.680
TALIESIN: I can give you guys enhanced ability,
too, for the remains of the evening. You can pick

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:14.077
something and both of you, if you want to be
better at something for a little while.

01:48:14.077 --> 01:48:18.118
LAURA: We never get into trouble together. I mean,
this is foolproof.

01:48:18.118 --> 01:48:20.500
SAM: It cannot fail!

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:23.650
LAURA: Any time we've tried to do anything
together, it went off seamlessly.

01:48:23.650 --> 01:48:27.007
SAM: This is the best plan we've ever had.

01:48:27.007 --> 01:48:29.426
TRAVIS: That's a natural one, this is going to
fucking suck.

01:48:29.426 --> 01:48:32.641
(laughter)

01:48:33.492 --> 01:48:35.212
TRAVIS: All right. Okay.

01:48:35.212 --> 01:48:36.938
MARISHA: What are me and Cad doing?

01:48:36.938 --> 01:48:43.736
SAM: We need someone just off the boat in case
things go awry. I'll message you that we need some

01:48:43.736 --> 01:48:51.607
help on the inside, and there needs to be someone
on the outside of Honda and Tiffany in case he

01:48:51.607 --> 01:48:54.292
needs some help in there, I don't know.

01:48:54.292 --> 01:48:55.078
TRAVIS: No.

01:48:55.078 --> 01:48:56.789
MARISHA: Cad, can you go with Honda?

01:48:56.789 --> 01:48:58.738
TALIESIN: I wouldn't know how to help with that.

01:48:58.738 --> 01:49:01.194
MARISHA: You have to be nearby.

01:49:01.908 --> 01:49:05.640
TALIESIN: It also seems like a lot of commitment,
but okay. I can keep an eye on that.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:09.364
TRAVIS: Also where are we staying tonight? Are we
staying at The Bloated Cup, or we finding--

01:49:09.364 --> 01:49:13.315
LAURA: We could stay on the boat. That would solve
all of our problems.

01:49:13.315 --> 01:49:14.611
MARISHA: Can we?

01:49:14.611 --> 01:49:16.351
TRAVIS: On Tiffany's ship?

01:49:16.351 --> 01:49:20.401
LAURA: I mean, we've been staying on it already,
don't we have quarters on there?

01:49:20.401 --> 01:49:22.644
MATT: I mean there are quarters on there you can
stay in, yes.

01:49:22.644 --> 01:49:27.805
SAM: Where were we meant to stay? Where are the
other crew staying? On the ship or on land?

01:49:27.805 --> 01:49:35.395
MATT: You're not sure. Some of them you saw found
rooms up top, above the tavern you were in. Others

01:49:35.395 --> 01:49:37.474
left for the night, you don't know where they
went.

01:49:37.474 --> 01:49:40.871
TRAVIS: It might not be a bad idea to find a room
that's not at the Bloated Cup and not on the ship.

01:49:40.871 --> 01:49:43.511
Just so we're not suspicious.

01:49:43.511 --> 01:49:45.961
TALIESIN: Have we seen anything around like
another tavern or something maybe a little, I hate

01:49:45.961 --> 01:49:48.236
to say, more upscale, but cleaner?

01:49:48.236 --> 01:49:50.396
MATT: Not really, not here.

01:49:50.396 --> 01:49:53.419
TALIESIN: Something with less piles of shit behind
it?

01:49:53.419 --> 01:50:00.540
MATT: No, you get the sense that Darktow doesn't
have a lot of offerings for travelers, since most

01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:06.828
of the travelers that come through here are part
of the Revelry. Only a few of them stay offshore.

01:50:06.828 --> 01:50:12.243
You passed a number of homes of people that live
here or spend a lot of time here and have in a boat.

01:50:12.243 --> 01:50:16.691
TRAVIS: How do you feel about rooms at the
Bloated, Cad?

01:50:16.691 --> 01:50:17.349
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:50:17.349 --> 01:50:18.710
TRAVIS: Three rooms?

01:50:18.710 --> 01:50:20.698
TALIESIN: Three rooms.

01:50:20.698 --> 01:50:23.314
TRAVIS: Hopefully some with windows?

01:50:23.314 --> 01:50:24.936
SAM: Sure.

01:50:24.936 --> 01:50:27.495
TRAVIS: Smells like shit in there.

01:50:28.038 --> 01:50:32.922
LAURA: We all wait until Fjord starts boning, and
then we start our action.

01:50:32.922 --> 01:50:41.404
MARISHA: How about this: Caleb and Caduceus and
Fjord, you're one team. You have Frumpkin watch

01:50:41.404 --> 01:50:49.888
Fjord, you give me the word when it's good to go,
I'll deliver that to Nott and Jessie, they go--

01:50:49.888 --> 01:50:52.453
LAURA: This is way more complicated than I thought
it was going to be.

01:50:52.453 --> 01:50:54.895
TALIESIN: I don't know, actually I'm following it
actually for the first time this entire--

01:50:54.895 --> 01:50:59.943
MARISHA: I'll give you the signal, you guys go,
I'll be nearby, I'll distract any guards if need

01:50:59.943 --> 01:51:06.639
be with my feminine wiles, and then you let me
know if there's any emergency--

01:51:06.639 --> 01:51:08.085
SAM: You're the runner.

01:51:08.085 --> 01:51:14.311
MARISHA: Then I will have no means to communicate
with anybody else, but you will.

01:51:14.311 --> 01:51:15.275
SAM: Sure.

01:51:15.275 --> 01:51:19.860
TALIESIN: You'll be a good go between. If we hear
something bad, we can get an owl to ship, if you

01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:21.230
hear something, then--

01:51:21.230 --> 01:51:24.707
MARISHA: Actually, that's a good point. How far
away is the Bloated Cup from the boat?

01:51:24.707 --> 01:51:30.679
MATT: From the boat? The Bloated Cup is right off
from where all the docks join and from the

01:51:30.679 --> 01:51:34.880
shipyard, so it's maybe about 300 feet away.

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:38.986
MARISHA: Oh, that's amazing. Cool. Perfect.

01:51:38.986 --> 01:51:40.497
TRAVIS: Famous last words.

01:51:40.497 --> 01:51:44.097
MARISHA: Good. It might be our downfall, but it's
great.

01:51:44.097 --> 01:51:45.414
MATT: All right.

01:51:45.414 --> 01:51:52.470
MARISHA: Okay, so I'll try and be within eyeshot
of the Bloated Cup, within eyeshot of you.

01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:54.524
SAM: Honda, are you going to be able to--

01:51:54.524 --> 01:51:57.472
TRAVIS: Look, I'll be fine. I'll make sure she's
occupied.

01:51:57.472 --> 01:52:01.299
SAM: I'm just saying, there's gonna be a peeping
tom in the room with you.

01:52:01.299 --> 01:52:04.565
TRAVIS: Now, what do you mean "in the room"?

01:52:04.565 --> 01:52:07.948
SAM: I think we need Frumpkin in there.

01:52:07.948 --> 01:52:09.085
TALIESIN: No.

01:52:09.085 --> 01:52:10.841
TRAVIS: What form is Frumpkin, an octopus?

01:52:10.841 --> 01:52:12.800
SAM: A peeping tomcat.

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:14.995
TRAVIS: Is he there?

01:52:14.995 --> 01:52:16.118
LIAM: He's right here.

01:52:16.118 --> 01:52:17.164
MARISHA: Oh, he's been in my---

01:52:17.164 --> 01:52:21.378
MATT: You see this really uncomfortably frazzled
owl that's been jammed in a pocket.

01:52:21.378 --> 01:52:23.022
MARISHA: Sorry I don't--

01:52:23.022 --> 01:52:25.326
TRAVIS: Am I carrying him in, like it's no big?

01:52:25.326 --> 01:52:27.848
TALIESIN: No, I don't think we--

01:52:27.848 --> 01:52:32.277
SAM: No, he can fly outside the window and peek
in, just to see if you're--

01:52:32.277 --> 01:52:37.141
LAURA: Avantika knows, I mean Tiffany knows that
that owl is yours, Caleb, it's not like it's a

01:52:37.141 --> 01:52:41.132
secret, if she's seen the owl before she's going
to know you're spying on her.

01:52:41.132 --> 01:52:45.664
TALIESIN: We don't need to actually know what's
going on in there. Why does anybody need to know that?

01:52:45.664 --> 01:52:50.419
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't think so. Listen, let's just
kick this thing off. I'll toss Frumpkin back to

01:52:50.419 --> 01:52:55.152
Caleb. Look, I leave this in your capable hands.

01:52:55.152 --> 01:53:03.827
LIAM: Well, Frumpkin has had a peek inside of her
quarters after she has seen him. She did not see

01:53:03.827 --> 01:53:08.094
him the first time. Although, to be doubly sure I
could change his shape again.

01:53:08.094 --> 01:53:12.347
TALIESIN: Well, I think the thing to do here, I
mean, it just makes sense, is that if you leave

01:53:12.347 --> 01:53:20.653
the room for any reason, we send Frumpkin to the
ship. They see Frumpkin, they know it's time to--

01:53:20.653 --> 01:53:21.834
MARISHA: To get out.

01:53:21.834 --> 01:53:23.019
TALIESIN: That's the signal.

01:53:23.019 --> 01:53:29.202
TRAVIS: If for some reason Tiffany's on the move,
or if something seems up, listen for thunder. How

01:53:29.202 --> 01:53:30.629
about that?

01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:37.651
MARISHA: Here, I slip Caduceus a few of those
firecrackers that I have.

01:53:37.651 --> 01:53:39.594
LAURA: His boning makes thunder.

01:53:39.594 --> 01:53:41.618
SAM: What's the source of the thunder? Is that
like--

01:53:41.618 --> 01:53:43.906
LAURA: His weenie.

01:53:46.347 --> 01:53:49.576
TRAVIS: Nothing I could say would beat that. So.

01:53:49.576 --> 01:53:53.638
LIAM: But, you know, if we're not comfortable, I
could change Frumpkin to be, say, a raven or something.

01:53:53.638 --> 01:53:55.582
TRAVIS: Sure, whatever you feel is best.

01:53:55.582 --> 01:53:56.657
MARISHA: How long will that take?

01:53:56.657 --> 01:54:00.251
TRAVIS: All right, here we go. I head off towards
The Bloated Cup.

01:54:00.251 --> 01:54:03.008
LAURA: We head towards the ship.

01:54:03.008 --> 01:54:04.465
MARISHA: Break!

01:54:04.465 --> 01:54:05.647
LAURA: We walk towards the ship.

01:54:05.647 --> 01:54:11.995
MATT: As you begin to settle towards your
directions for the evening here, under the shadow

01:54:11.995 --> 01:54:20.026
of moonlit mist, within the pirate city of
Darktow, we're going to go ahead and take a break.

01:54:20.026 --> 01:54:21.942
We'll be back here in a little bit to see how
this--

01:54:21.942 --> 01:54:23.412
MARISHA: This is either the best plan or the worst
plan.

01:54:23.412 --> 01:54:28.607
MATT: I'm excited to see what the fuck is going to
happen next. Before we leave, we do have our

01:54:28.607 --> 01:54:34.620
Wyrmwood giveaway. Our fantastic friends at
Wyrmwood have brought this fantastic-- Oh, this is

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:43.140
pretty wood! This is a lacewood tabletop dice
tray. It looks like bronze dragonhide the way it

01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:50.141
looks against the-- it's so pretty! Leather inside
there, it's awesome. One lucky winner will have

01:54:50.141 --> 01:54:55.163
this at the end of the break. Jump over into the
Critical Role Twitch chat, that's

01:54:55.163 --> 01:55:01.102
twitch.tv/criticalrole. To enter, the codeword
tonight is "pirates." Plural, pirates. Enter the

01:55:01.102 --> 01:55:06.415
word once to enter. Any more than that and
unfortunately you'll be disqualified. Only people

01:55:06.415 --> 01:55:12.953
in the US and Canada, excluding Quebec, can enter,
because of stupid international gifting contest

01:55:12.953 --> 01:55:18.467
rules. Anyway, we'll be back here in a moment with
the winner. See you then.

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:22.612
MATT: And welcome back, everyone. Before we get to
it, we do have our winner of the fantastic

01:55:22.612 --> 01:55:29.107
lacewood tabletop dice tray from our friends at
Wyrmwood. It is EmperorGeiserick.

01:55:29.107 --> 01:55:35.156
EmperorGeiserick, congratulations. We'll get your
info and get this sent out to you ASAP. Well done,

01:55:35.156 --> 01:55:45.207
hope you enjoy. Bringing us into the moment as you
guys scatter to your various plans.

01:55:45.207 --> 01:55:48.912
MARISHA: It's a great plan.

01:55:48.912 --> 01:55:56.341
MATT: We have Fjord going to the upper floor of
the Bloated Cup. What are the rest of you doing at

01:55:56.414 --> 01:55:57.463
this moment?

01:55:57.463 --> 01:55:58.603
TRAVIS: Real confident, real strong.

01:55:58.603 --> 01:56:03.589
TALIESIN: I'm staying downstairs to wait for you
to either come down or for her to leave. I'm going

01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:09.630
to sit and probably try and find something
non-alcoholic to drink so I don't have to be an idiot.

01:56:09.630 --> 01:56:12.220
LIAM: That's where it's going to go down is in the
Bloated Cup.

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.383
TALIESIN: Upstairs.

01:56:13.383 --> 01:56:18.484
LIAM: I thought maybe it would say like maybe you
know, romantic on the boat. But great. Good. So,

01:56:18.484 --> 01:56:25.355
if that's the case, then I'm not getting into that
room. I think that I should tail this team

01:56:25.355 --> 01:56:29.112
instead, if you've got an eye on the exit to that
building.

01:56:29.112 --> 01:56:34.094
TALIESIN: Let me see, yeah.

01:56:34.094 --> 01:56:38.871
LAURA: Shouldn't you be able to Message Nott and
say she's on the move if--

01:56:38.871 --> 01:56:39.965
LIAM: Yeah.

01:56:39.965 --> 01:56:43.856
LAURA: So maybe stay close where you can see it if
she leaves?

01:56:43.856 --> 01:56:47.591
LIAM: Yeah.

01:56:47.971 --> 01:56:52.372
MATT: Okay. Yasha is doing what as part of this?

01:56:52.579 --> 01:56:59.820
TALIESIN: I think Yasha is probably either with
you-- She's either with you or with us, I imagine.

01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:04.736
MATT: Probably with you. She's a bit conspicuous.
If things go really bad, she'll be ready to help

01:57:04.736 --> 01:57:06.895
out on that side of things.

01:57:06.895 --> 01:57:08.659
TRAVIS: If Bouldergut is in the Bloated Cup,
that's where Yasha is.

01:57:08.659 --> 01:57:10.809
MATT: There you go.

01:57:10.809 --> 01:57:19.313
MARISHA: I turn my cloak inside-out to the
inconspicuous side, and case towards the docks,

01:57:19.313 --> 01:57:27.115
and start casing the area for Revelry that are
guarding the area, or potentially, a good place

01:57:27.115 --> 01:57:29.453
for them to do the thing.

01:57:29.453 --> 01:57:31.864
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:57:32.523 --> 01:57:36.454
TRAVIS: Is somebody aiding you in that? No.

01:57:36.454 --> 01:57:37.330
MARISHA: 13.

01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:45.606
MATT: 13. Okay. Looking out along the docks, there
are two particular watch-outs that are assigned to

01:57:45.606 --> 01:57:54.269
that particular part of the docks, where the
Squalleater is currently wet anchored. You also

01:57:54.269 --> 01:58:00.880
see two individuals on the deck of the ship, not
holding torches, but you can see them through the

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:07.791
fog. One of them walks and moves. That's what you
see.

01:58:07.791 --> 01:58:12.007
MARISHA: Do I see anything that looks like it
could be a potentially good area for them to cast

01:58:12.007 --> 01:58:15.943
a spell without being noticed?

01:58:15.943 --> 01:58:21.340
MATT: The docks are pretty open here. There isn't
much of a place to hide. This isn't a major

01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:25.830
shipping region. Most everything is taken off the
docks and off the ships and then brought into

01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:31.406
shore, so there isn't a bunch of errant piles of
boxes and barrels, per se. The docks are pretty

01:58:31.406 --> 01:58:38.574
open. Best bet would be somehow under the docks,
but most of that is in the ocean, or trying your

01:58:38.637 --> 01:58:41.953
best to wait for a moment when people aren't
paying attention.

01:58:41.953 --> 01:58:50.196
MARISHA: Okay. I block around as to not look like
it's going the same way that I just came from and

01:58:50.196 --> 01:58:54.718
catch back up with these two. With the
detectives.

01:58:54.718 --> 01:58:58.523
MATT: All right. As you guys are having this
conversation, Beauregard manages to circle back

01:58:58.523 --> 01:59:00.057
and come back to you.

01:59:00.057 --> 01:59:06.760
MARISHA: All right, there's two guards casing the
dock and two of Avantika's-- Tiffany's people on

01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:14.652
the ship. It looks pretty open, we might want to
find an alternative for you guys to not be noticed

01:59:14.652 --> 01:59:19.390
as you do the crazy magic thing.

01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:21.704
SAM: It looks open?

01:59:21.704 --> 01:59:28.957
MARISHA: It's super open, two guards guarding the
dock and two people on the deck of Tiffany's ship.

01:59:28.957 --> 01:59:30.668
SAM: Getting on is not a problem.

01:59:30.668 --> 01:59:33.570
LAURA: Yeah, we can just go to our quarters or
something.

01:59:33.570 --> 01:59:37.874
MARISHA: To then bamf over? Our quarters in the--

01:59:37.874 --> 01:59:39.130
SAM: Inside the ship.

01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:42.649
LAURA: Yeah. What do you think?

01:59:42.649 --> 01:59:43.450
MARISHA: Okay.

01:59:43.506 --> 01:59:45.288
SAM: We can just be there.

01:59:45.288 --> 01:59:49.329
MARISHA: You guys are going to have to talk to
guards and convince yourself on the way in and you

01:59:49.329 --> 01:59:50.822
will be noticed.

01:59:50.822 --> 01:59:54.550
SAM: No. We just are in.

01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:56.721
LAURA: Because it's our ship.

01:59:56.721 --> 01:59:57.644
SAM: What do you mean?

01:59:57.644 --> 01:59:59.096
MARISHA: We're talking about two different things
here.

01:59:59.096 --> 02:00:00.864
SAM: Please, start over again.

02:00:00.864 --> 02:00:07.007
MARISHA: There are two guards guarding the docks,
there are two people on the ship of Avantika's

02:00:07.007 --> 02:00:12.801
bo-- of Tiffany's boat. On the de-- You get what
I'm saying? The deck of the ship. Of the boat.

02:00:12.801 --> 02:00:14.610
SAM: Uh-huh.

02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:18.863
TRAVIS: It's real sotto, so we don't have to use
code words anymore.

02:00:18.863 --> 02:00:28.058
MARISHA: If you all want to just walk on to your
quarters, you will have two guards and two of our

02:00:28.058 --> 02:00:32.024
crew members who will see you walk on.

02:00:32.024 --> 02:00:35.972
LIAM: I think what Beau's implying is perhaps it's
better that we're never seen there at all.

02:00:35.972 --> 02:00:40.589
MARISHA: We hide somewhere and we're never seen at
all and you'll bamf in. Unless you disguise

02:00:40.589 --> 02:00:49.794
yourself as Tiffany now. Then I would say we find
a hidden place, potentially in our private

02:00:49.794 --> 02:00:56.977
quarters in the Bloated Cup, that you bamf into.

02:00:56.977 --> 02:00:58.838
LAURA: Is it within 500 feet of--

02:00:58.838 --> 02:01:00.634
MARISHA: He said it was within 300.

02:01:00.634 --> 02:01:04.152
LAURA: Fuck yeah. Yeah, let's go to our quarters
in the Bloated Cup.

02:01:04.152 --> 02:01:05.685
SAM: We're going to start the bamf there.

02:01:05.685 --> 02:01:07.924
LAURA: Start it in the tavern!

02:01:07.954 --> 02:01:15.703
MARISHA: I will be nearby, near the docks. Signal
if you need me.

02:01:15.703 --> 02:01:17.271
SAM: You won't see us ever.

02:01:17.271 --> 02:01:18.595
MARISHA: Good.

02:01:18.595 --> 02:01:24.014
LIAM: Here is how I would like to contribute.
First, I'm going to disguise myself when it is

02:01:24.014 --> 02:01:29.812
time. Not yet, but I will make myself look like
voice actor Charlie Adler. I will be

02:01:29.812 --> 02:01:33.824
salt-and-pepper-- I'll fit right in on the docks.

02:01:33.824 --> 02:01:35.300
MATT: Oh, you'll fit right in in Darktow.

02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:42.360
LIAM: I won't be in a denim tuxedo, but I will
wear traditional pirate garb.

02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.865
TRAVIS: He's our type, man, he thinks sleeves are
bullshit too.

02:01:44.865 --> 02:01:50.512
LIAM: They are bullshit. There will be no sleeves
on this disguise. I'm going to hang out between

02:01:50.512 --> 02:01:58.317
the Bloated Cup and the ship, looking like
Charlie. Frumpkin I will just have circle a

02:01:58.317 --> 02:02:04.045
continuous circle above the whole area so I can
see the guards on the boat, and we can message

02:02:04.045 --> 02:02:09.232
each other, ja? I'll just be eyes in the sky,
Charlie on the ground.

02:02:09.232 --> 02:02:11.189
MATT: You got it. All right.

02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:15.055
TALIESIN: How's a dex bonus go for you? How's an
advantage on dex, or do you already have--

02:02:15.136 --> 02:02:16.982
SAM: I mean, I have very high dexterity.

02:02:16.982 --> 02:02:19.454
LAURA: Could always use advantage.

02:02:19.454 --> 02:02:20.676
SAM: Okay.

02:02:20.676 --> 02:02:26.699
TALIESIN: Less that could possibly go wrong, so
before they go in, I'm going to cast Enhance

02:02:26.699 --> 02:02:32.277
Ability on these two. At a level three, so I get
two people.

02:02:32.277 --> 02:02:34.301
SAM: Maybe charisma?

02:02:34.301 --> 02:02:36.439
MARISHA: Yeah, for the deception.

02:02:36.439 --> 02:02:38.497
SAM: Leaving.

02:02:38.497 --> 02:02:40.196
TALIESIN: That's fair. All right.

02:02:40.196 --> 02:02:42.753
SAM: I can already dex my way around.

02:02:42.753 --> 02:02:46.452
LAURA: We could potentially jump out the window
too.

02:02:46.452 --> 02:02:47.567
SAM: But you can't.

02:02:47.567 --> 02:02:48.502
LAURA: What are you talking about?

02:02:48.502 --> 02:02:49.749
SAM: Are you dextrous?

02:02:49.749 --> 02:02:52.566
LAURA: I'm so dextrous.

02:02:52.566 --> 02:03:01.004
TALIESIN: It also will give you zero damage for a
20-foot fall, if I give you a dex bonus. But--

02:03:01.004 --> 02:03:02.749
SAM: I have Feather Fall.

02:03:02.749 --> 02:03:05.952
TALIESIN: You have Feather Fall. So you want
charisma.

02:03:05.952 --> 02:03:07.620
SAM: Maybe?

02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:11.374
TALIESIN: That's not helpful. Charisma. Unless you
make a decision in the next 30 seconds.

02:03:11.374 --> 02:03:13.827
SAM: Yes, I want it! Give it to me now!

02:03:13.827 --> 02:03:18.610
TALIESIN: Cool. And you're getting wisdom. You
have advantage on wisdom, you have advantage on

02:03:18.610 --> 02:03:31.387
charisma. Then right before you go in, I'm going
to give you guys both a resistance bump before we

02:03:31.387 --> 02:03:35.554
push them through the door. Just in case you need
it.

02:03:35.554 --> 02:03:37.031
LAURA: We're up in our rooms.

02:03:37.031 --> 02:03:40.888
TALIESIN: For one minute, they can add a d4 to a
saving throw.

02:03:40.888 --> 02:03:44.933
SAM: Ooh, did anyone touch the dodecahedron yet?

02:03:44.933 --> 02:03:46.730
MARISHA: Someone do that.

02:03:46.730 --> 02:03:50.314
SAM: Fjord, do you want to do it? I guess you're
already fucking.

02:03:50.314 --> 02:03:53.001
TRAVIS: No, I'm not.

02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:56.208
SAM: Do you want the dodeca?

02:03:57.546 --> 02:04:00.301
TALIESIN: Is it just a general d4 bonus?

02:04:00.301 --> 02:04:02.058
MATT: What are you using?

02:04:02.058 --> 02:04:05.767
TALIESIN: A cantrip. You touch one willing
creature once before the spell ends. The target

02:04:05.767 --> 02:04:07.718
can roll a d4 and add the number to its roll.

02:04:07.718 --> 02:04:10.962
MATT: It's Resistance. It is a concentration, so
that would override your Enhance Ability.

02:04:10.962 --> 02:04:16.398
TALIESIN: Oh, you're right, absolutely, never mind
then. Not a big deal. Thank you. I'm getting used

02:04:16.398 --> 02:04:17.633
to this concentration.

02:04:17.633 --> 02:04:22.058
MATT: That's all good, no worries. It's a little
bit of a juggle. All right, while this is all

02:04:22.058 --> 02:04:23.153
being set up--

02:04:23.153 --> 02:04:24.325
LAURA: Nott, just look at the dodecahedron.

02:04:24.325 --> 02:04:25.888
SAM: (screaming)

02:04:25.888 --> 02:04:27.509
MATT: You have your--

02:04:27.509 --> 02:04:29.000
SAM: Fate point.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:37.213
MARISHA: Before they leave and we all go our
respective ways, I go: All right, listen. Rich

02:04:37.213 --> 02:04:44.777
people love to have safes, but they love to hide
stuff in the walls of safes, like false bottoms in

02:04:44.777 --> 02:04:47.418
drawers. Stuff like that.

02:04:47.418 --> 02:04:48.708
TRAVIS: False backs to safes.

02:04:48.708 --> 02:04:53.871
MARISHA: False backs to safes. So even if you get
in, and you think you find everything, double- and

02:04:53.871 --> 02:04:58.285
triple-check, all right? They love to write shit
down, I'm telling you it's there.

02:04:58.285 --> 02:04:59.509
LAURA: Okay.

02:04:59.509 --> 02:05:01.534
SAM: You've stolen from a lot of rich people.

02:05:01.534 --> 02:05:03.574
LAURA: Yeah. She stole mail one time.

02:05:03.574 --> 02:05:07.562
SAM: I know, it's sort of her defining trait.

02:05:07.562 --> 02:05:11.420
LAURA: That and her beautiful hair. (laughs)

02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:14.554
MARISHA: Thanks.

02:05:14.554 --> 02:05:18.323
SAM: When you laugh right after you said that, I
think that was very insulting.

02:05:18.323 --> 02:05:22.078
(laughter)

02:05:22.078 --> 02:05:23.650
MARISHA: Was she not complimenting me?

02:05:23.650 --> 02:05:24.924
SAM: No, she was laughing.

02:05:24.924 --> 02:05:31.004
LAURA: I wasn't, Beau, I love your hair. I wasn't
laughing at you!

02:05:31.004 --> 02:05:32.742
MARISHA: Just go steal from rich people.

02:05:32.742 --> 02:05:35.009
LAURA: I wasn't laughing at you, I love your hair,
okay.

02:05:35.009 --> 02:05:36.824
SAM: We're ready. Let's do this.

02:05:36.824 --> 02:05:49.741
MATT: While you guys begin to set your ways,
Fjord. You make your way to the Bloated Cup. Where

02:05:49.741 --> 02:05:50.844
do you head?

02:05:50.844 --> 02:05:52.427
LIAM: (singing) Thunderstruck!

02:05:52.427 --> 02:05:56.975
TRAVIS: I'll head up the stairs to the second room
on the right, was it?

02:05:56.975 --> 02:05:58.940
LAURA: (whispering) Left. Second room on the
left.

02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:01.797
MATT: Do you want to knock?

02:06:06.019 --> 02:06:07.688
TRAVIS: Anyone in the hallways?

02:06:07.688 --> 02:06:08.750
MATT: At the moment, no.

02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:10.750
TRAVIS: No sign of Bouldergut?

02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:13.458
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:06:16.074 --> 02:06:17.104
TRAVIS: 11.

02:06:17.104 --> 02:06:19.817
MATT: No, no sign of Bouldergut.

02:06:19.817 --> 02:06:21.041
TRAVIS: She's an ogre.

02:06:21.041 --> 02:06:21.717
MATT: I know.

02:06:21.717 --> 02:06:27.060
TRAVIS: Okay. Yeah, second door on the right, and
I'll put my ear against the door.

02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:29.279
MATT: Make another perception check.

02:06:29.279 --> 02:06:32.545
TRAVIS: Shit, balls, ass. Oh, three.

02:06:32.545 --> 02:06:35.042
MATT: You don't hear anything through the door.

02:06:35.042 --> 02:06:36.899
TRAVIS: (sighs)

02:06:36.899 --> 02:06:39.243
MARISHA: Can't hear from the blood pumping in his
ears?

02:06:39.243 --> 02:06:43.606
TRAVIS: (heartbeat)

02:06:47.565 --> 02:06:49.170
(knocking)

02:06:53.226 --> 02:07:00.828
MATT: There's a slight pause and you hear some
rustling and some shuffling. A voice goes, "Who is it?"

02:07:00.828 --> 02:07:07.930
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. Is-- (clears throat) is the
captain in?

02:07:07.930 --> 02:07:10.374
MATT: "Who the fuck is this?"

02:07:10.374 --> 02:07:14.826
TRAVIS: Fjord. Who's this?

02:07:14.826 --> 02:07:18.105
MATT: "Piss off, I'm sleeping."

02:07:18.105 --> 02:07:25.207
TRAVIS: Second door on the-- Is there a door
across the hall?

02:07:25.207 --> 02:07:27.294
MATT: There is.

02:07:27.294 --> 02:07:28.905
TRAVIS: I'll put my ear on that one.

02:07:28.905 --> 02:07:31.138
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:07:31.795 --> 02:07:33.246
TRAVIS: Three.

02:07:33.634 --> 02:07:39.285
MATT: Don't hear anything. (faster heartbeat)

02:07:39.285 --> 02:07:41.303
TRAVIS: Does it look like there's any light on
under the door?

02:07:41.303 --> 02:07:45.239
MATT: Maybe a faint bit.

02:07:47.203 --> 02:07:49.528
(knocking)

02:07:50.075 --> 02:07:54.853
MATT: You hear some heavy shifting. "Hi?"

02:07:54.853 --> 02:07:59.971
TRAVIS: Bouldergut?

02:07:59.971 --> 02:08:08.403
MATT: "Just open the fucking door." "Okay." The
door comes open. You see there, crunched down in

02:08:08.403 --> 02:08:16.844
the room, head hunched forward, is Bouldergut,
who's been holding vigil at the doorway. (grunts)

02:08:16.932 --> 02:08:22.141
Pats you into the chamber. You get pushed in.
Avantika's sitting on the edge of the bed,

02:08:22.141 --> 02:08:29.918
currently reading through a book with the window
open outside, and goes, "Quartermaster."

02:08:29.918 --> 02:08:31.404
TRAVIS: Captain.

02:08:31.404 --> 02:08:41.241
MATT: "Bouldergut, if you would be so kind as to
keep watch on the hallway for a bit." Bouldergut

02:08:41.241 --> 02:08:52.189
goes, "Okay. If I hear any--" "If you hear
anything, don't bother." "Okay." She leaves the

02:08:52.189 --> 02:09:00.361
chamber, closes the door behind her. Closes the
book, sets it on a small table.

02:09:00.361 --> 02:09:03.254
TRAVIS: She's very loyal.

02:09:03.254 --> 02:09:07.138
MATT: "That is my favorite kind of person."

02:09:07.138 --> 02:09:10.880
TRAVIS: How long has Bouldergut been with you in
your service?

02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:19.172
MATT: "Going on the better part of a decade. We
actually both met when I was first beginning my career."

02:09:19.172 --> 02:09:25.661
TRAVIS: Quite some time. How have your evenings
been?

02:09:25.661 --> 02:09:31.130
MATT: "Well, very busy with our attempt to make it
to Darktow and keep things organized in

02:09:31.130 --> 02:09:35.270
"preparation. So. Lonely."

02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:38.868
TRAVIS: Any more dreams?

02:09:40.973 --> 02:09:42.606
MATT: "A few."

02:09:44.153 --> 02:09:45.410
TRAVIS: Tell me.

02:09:46.737 --> 02:09:48.958
MATT: "How about I show you instead?"

02:09:51.033 --> 02:09:55.185
TRAVIS: Yes. I'd like that.

02:09:57.063 --> 02:10:01.187
MATT: So you begin keeping her busy.

02:10:01.187 --> 02:10:06.172
LAURA: Oh. I see.

02:10:06.172 --> 02:10:08.319
MATT: Or she keeps you busy, actually, would be
more the--

02:10:08.364 --> 02:10:11.253
TRAVIS: Yes, that's more correct, yeah.

02:10:11.253 --> 02:10:22.787
MATT: While that's happening, you guys made your
way back to the inn. It's a very muddied view of

02:10:22.787 --> 02:10:30.740
the ship because of the mist, but you can still
make out the major details of the outskirts of it

02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:32.209
from this far away.

02:10:32.209 --> 02:10:38.796
LAURA: Okay. I don't need to be able to see it. I
know exactly the spot I desire. I can visualize it

02:10:38.796 --> 02:10:40.739
because we've been in her office before.

02:10:40.739 --> 02:10:43.202
MATT: Correct. You have. So yeah, you can.

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:46.323
SAM: How does this work?

02:10:46.323 --> 02:10:48.564
LAURA: I don't know. I've never done it before.

02:10:48.564 --> 02:10:52.602
SAM: Well, is there a chance it could fail? Might
we die?

02:10:52.602 --> 02:10:54.134
LAURA: Never.

02:10:55.418 --> 02:11:00.343
LIAM: Do me a favor. I'm going to go outside now,
okay, and keep watch. Let me know when you're on

02:11:00.343 --> 02:11:05.059
and give me updates. Good luck. Charlie Adler.

02:11:05.059 --> 02:11:09.925
MATT: All right. The best new abracadabra.

02:11:09.925 --> 02:11:13.626
LIAM: Charlie! For every spell.

02:11:13.626 --> 02:11:17.523
MARISHA: I'm on my way towards the docks.

02:11:17.523 --> 02:11:19.410
SAM: Are we synchronizing watches? What is this?

02:11:19.410 --> 02:11:20.045
LAURA: Doorways are the tits!

02:11:20.045 --> 02:11:22.871
SAM: What? Ah!

02:11:22.871 --> 02:11:27.356
MATT: There's a brief moment where you feel like
the air's been drawn out of your lungs, and you

02:11:27.356 --> 02:11:31.364
feel as if you're being suddenly thrust forward
from behind, somebody pushing the small of your

02:11:31.364 --> 02:11:35.858
back with such intense speed that you feel like
your neck is about to just whiplash terribly

02:11:35.858 --> 02:11:42.365
backward. Then suddenly you come to a stop, and
you're both standing in the middle of Avantika's

02:11:42.365 --> 02:11:46.062
quarters on the ship. It's dark.

02:11:46.062 --> 02:11:49.065
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on both of us.

02:11:49.065 --> 02:11:50.104
MATT: All right.

02:11:50.104 --> 02:11:51.974
MARISHA: Yas, queen, yas.

02:11:51.974 --> 02:11:59.646
SAM: That was amazing! We are secret agents! We're
secret detectives!

02:11:59.646 --> 02:12:02.690
LAURA: We are amazing! We need to start looking
because we only have a few minutes.

02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:11.077
SAM: Yes. Oh, wait, I've already forgotten! Take
out the wire, fold it just so. Okay. We're in the

02:12:11.077 --> 02:12:12.560
ship, Caleb.

02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:13.407
MATT: What's the range on that?

02:12:13.407 --> 02:12:18.444
SAM: 120 feet. Can you hear me? Reply to this
message.

02:12:18.444 --> 02:12:22.686
MATT: The range on Message?

02:12:22.686 --> 02:12:23.858
SAM: 120 feet.

02:12:23.858 --> 02:12:25.626
MATT: 120 feet? He's out of range.

02:12:25.626 --> 02:12:29.414
LIAM: I'm out in the docks. You said the boat--

02:12:29.414 --> 02:12:31.108
MATT: Correct. You haven't made it there yet.

02:12:31.108 --> 02:12:32.073
LIAM: Oh, okay.

02:12:32.073 --> 02:12:38.196
MARISHA: You're staying in between. I'm heading a
little bit further. The daisy chain.

02:12:38.196 --> 02:12:41.026
MATT: Yeah, because you guys instantaneously
traveled. He has a few more minutes before he'll

02:12:41.026 --> 02:12:42.225
reach range.

02:12:42.225 --> 02:12:47.472
MARISHA: So you guys, to Beau, to Caleb, to Cad,
to Fjord.

02:12:47.472 --> 02:12:51.844
SAM: Beauregard, can you hear me? If you can,
respond to this message.

02:12:51.844 --> 02:12:54.633
MARISHA: I can hear you. I have responded to this
message.

02:12:54.633 --> 02:12:59.062
SAM: We are inside the boat. Relay that message
when you can. Bye.

02:12:59.062 --> 02:13:02.679
LAURA: Okay, start looking. Can we both see,
because we both have darkvision?

02:13:02.679 --> 02:13:07.858
MATT: You can, but there's a lack of color. It's
mostly some shades of black and white and gray.

02:13:07.858 --> 02:13:12.266
LAURA: We should probably figure out a way to
light up the room. Are there curtains?

02:13:12.266 --> 02:13:17.804
MATT: There are two sets of small curtains that
are currently tied off on the sides of the windows

02:13:17.804 --> 02:13:20.125
that can open onto the balcony.

02:13:20.125 --> 02:13:21.518
SAM: Do you want to burn them for light?

02:13:21.518 --> 02:13:22.630
LAURA: No, we should close them.

02:13:22.630 --> 02:13:24.433
SAM: Oh, okay. That's better.

02:13:24.433 --> 02:13:28.153
LAURA: I sneak over and close the windows
quietly.

02:13:28.153 --> 02:13:29.863
SAM: Just close the windows.

02:13:29.863 --> 02:13:32.560
MATT: As a general note, I would like you both to
make a stealth check as you go about your activities.

02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:33.971
SAM: Hood up.

02:13:33.971 --> 02:13:35.715
LIAM: Also, while they do that-- I'm sorry.

02:13:35.715 --> 02:13:36.945
MATT: Just a moment.

02:13:36.945 --> 02:13:39.815
LAURA: Oh, you already have advantage? Blessing of
the Trickster! There you go, I gave you blessing,

02:13:39.815 --> 02:13:41.602
so you get advantage.

02:13:41.602 --> 02:13:43.169
TRAVIS: Can you give yourself advantage?

02:13:43.169 --> 02:13:45.232
LAURA: (gasps) Natural 20!

02:13:45.232 --> 02:13:47.270
SAM: 18.

02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:49.002
LAURA: Plus ten, because Pass Without a Trace.

02:13:49.002 --> 02:13:50.855
MATT: 28, and what's your total?

02:13:50.855 --> 02:13:55.219
LAURA: 24? No, wait. 34.

02:13:55.219 --> 02:13:56.618
MATT: Okay.

02:13:56.618 --> 02:13:58.162
MARISHA: Fuck. Yes.

02:13:58.162 --> 02:14:04.720
MATT: You both are (whooshing). For every piece of
wood that begins to creak as you step, because it

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:10.544
is a lot of aged wood that makes up this ship,
begins to (creak), you stop yourself, and then

02:14:10.544 --> 02:14:14.227
shift the foot and you manage to make your way
across here without any of the wood creaking.

02:14:14.227 --> 02:14:16.991
LAURA: Does she have a candle in the room that we
could light?

02:14:16.991 --> 02:14:18.628
MATT: There are a number of candles, you could see
that there's--

02:14:18.628 --> 02:14:22.661
SAM: There's probably gap under the doorway, a gap
under there. They'll see a glowing light.

02:14:22.661 --> 02:14:27.074
LAURA: Take your cloak off and shove it under the
door to block the light.

02:14:27.074 --> 02:14:29.318
SAM: I would reveal my unmentionables!

02:14:29.318 --> 02:14:33.378
LAURA: I take my cloak off and I put it next to
the doorway to block the light.

02:14:33.378 --> 02:14:37.696
SAM: I'll take my cloak and hang it over the
curtains so it's double-blocked.

02:14:37.696 --> 02:14:40.425
MATT: Okay, like duvet over the window.

02:14:40.425 --> 02:14:42.410
LAURA: I light the candle.

02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:47.474
MARISHA: I signal to Caleb that they've made it on
the ship.

02:14:47.474 --> 02:14:53.288
LIAM: I was going to say, once I'm out and about,
about once every 30 seconds I will lean on

02:14:53.288 --> 02:14:59.020
something, pretending like I'm slightly drunk, and
I will go into Frumpkin's vision from above, just

02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:04.507
for five seconds, to look at the activity on the
boat and where those guards are, and then go out of it.

02:15:04.507 --> 02:15:10.899
MATT: Perception check for Frumpkin. I'll say at
disadvantage because of the mist, unfortunately.

02:15:10.899 --> 02:15:15.562
LIAM: Okay. Ooh, terrible. So terrible. That's six
or seven.

02:15:15.562 --> 02:15:22.174
MATT: Okay. You can see the torchlight from the
two guards that are on the actual docks, and one

02:15:22.174 --> 02:15:26.196
of them's keeping an eye out on the water, and one
of them's keeping an eye on the docks. They're

02:15:26.196 --> 02:15:29.817
stationed to keep an eye out not just to what's
happening within the actual shipyard, but also

02:15:29.817 --> 02:15:33.914
beyond, as far as they can into the mist, for any
ships that are arriving in the middle of the

02:15:33.914 --> 02:15:38.008
night. But Frumpkin cannot see the people on the
actual deck of the ship.

02:15:38.008 --> 02:15:39.173
LIAM: It's all that fog.

02:15:39.173 --> 02:15:41.937
MATT: Yeah. All right.

02:15:41.937 --> 02:15:45.649
TALIESIN: Does Nott's cloak unattune if they take
it off?

02:15:45.649 --> 02:15:52.761
MATT: Technically, yes. Now that you have the
candlelight there, gently there, quietly.

02:15:52.761 --> 02:15:54.484
LAURA: We start searching through her office.

02:15:54.484 --> 02:15:55.475
MATT: What are you looking for?

02:15:55.475 --> 02:16:02.973
LAURA: We're looking for anything she's written
about where the last fruit tree is, the last temple.

02:16:02.973 --> 02:16:04.631
SAM: You're going through papers, yeah?

02:16:04.631 --> 02:16:05.663
LAURA: I'm going through papers.

02:16:05.663 --> 02:16:09.728
SAM: I'm going to go around the walls and look for
hidden safes.

02:16:09.728 --> 02:16:13.705
LAURA: I'm looking through her desk, seeing if I
can find any false bottoms or anything like that

02:16:13.705 --> 02:16:15.421
to try to find secret information.

02:16:15.421 --> 02:16:19.240
MATT: Okay. Do you want to each make an
investigation check, or do you want to help one or

02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:21.138
the other make it?

02:16:21.138 --> 02:16:22.364
LAURA: Each make an investigation.

02:16:22.364 --> 02:16:25.491
MATT: Then both of you make an investigation
check, please.

02:16:25.815 --> 02:16:27.436
LAURA: Oh, we get advantage? No.

02:16:27.436 --> 02:16:28.531
MATT: No, you do not.

02:16:28.531 --> 02:16:30.109
SAM: We get advantage on everything.

02:16:30.109 --> 02:16:31.645
MATT: You took charisma and wisdom, so you do
not.

02:16:31.645 --> 02:16:32.775
LAURA: Shit.

02:16:37.025 --> 02:16:38.434
SAM: 19.

02:16:39.143 --> 02:16:44.746
LAURA: Nine. Which is like a natural 20 in this
campaign.

02:16:44.746 --> 02:16:49.474
MATT: Going through the desk, the first thing that
happens is one of the drawers gives you

02:16:49.474 --> 02:16:58.745
resistance. It's locked. The other drawers you
pull open, there is blank paper, a quill, a couple

02:16:58.745 --> 02:17:07.921
of small little ink pots. The next one beneath has
a folded piece of cloth that you pull out and

02:17:07.921 --> 02:17:13.514
inspect. It looks like it's a cover either for the
desk or something else. You're not quite sure what

02:17:13.514 --> 02:17:22.977
the purpose is. Checking under the desk, you don't
find any other hidden chambers or anything that

02:17:22.977 --> 02:17:25.494
marks what you were searching for.

02:17:25.494 --> 02:17:26.391
LAURA: Okay.

02:17:26.391 --> 02:17:27.693
MATT: Nott, you were looking for--?

02:17:27.693 --> 02:17:33.000
SAM: Hidden safes in the wall, trap-opening
thingies.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.465
MATT: Glancing around, there is a shelf unit with
a number of books on it. You pull back some of the

02:17:37.465 --> 02:17:43.944
books and look behind it, along the back of the
actual bookshelf itself. You don't find any hidden

02:17:43.944 --> 02:17:48.867
pockets in there. There's a small cabinet
underneath, and you open it up and there's a

02:17:48.867 --> 02:17:59.710
series of wooden and metal cups, wine goblets and
various types of imbibement containers. Pushing

02:17:59.710 --> 02:18:07.075
through there, you do find one panel on the back
that's a bit loose, and you slide it off and

02:18:07.075 --> 02:18:13.597
behind there you see a small leather book.

02:18:13.597 --> 02:18:17.377
SAM: I'll check it for traps.

02:18:17.377 --> 02:18:18.444
MATT: Make a--

02:18:18.444 --> 02:18:20.144
SAM: Investigation?

02:18:20.335 --> 02:18:26.634
MATT: The weird perception/investigation thing for
traps, this is the eternal debate back and forth.

02:18:26.634 --> 02:18:30.751
Go ahead and consider this a perception check.

02:18:30.751 --> 02:18:32.512
SAM: Three.

02:18:32.512 --> 02:18:36.512
MARISHA: What? What would investigation have
been?

02:18:36.512 --> 02:18:38.480
SAM: 12.

02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:41.302
MARISHA: But you're a badass rogue!

02:18:41.302 --> 02:18:48.746
MATT: It depends. There's a difference between
noticing something's off, and then ascertaining

02:18:48.746 --> 02:18:55.012
the nature of whatever's off that would be an
actual trap. Since you're looking for traps,

02:18:55.012 --> 02:18:59.869
specifically for this one, and not noticing
something different, I would say allowing this to

02:18:59.869 --> 02:19:01.565
be an investigation.

02:19:01.565 --> 02:19:03.176
SAM: Well, it's still pretty low. 12.

02:19:03.176 --> 02:19:04.842
MATT: I know, yeah.

02:19:04.842 --> 02:19:06.613
LAURA: This is better than three.

02:19:06.613 --> 02:19:08.652
MATT: I know. It does not appear to be trapped.

02:19:08.652 --> 02:19:11.449
SAM: Okay. I will pick up the book.

02:19:11.449 --> 02:19:17.642
MATT: Okay. You pull the book back, and as soon as
you pull back there's a slight tug on it, like

02:19:17.642 --> 02:19:25.146
something that gives resistance, and then comes
free. A little piece of cable or twine falls to

02:19:25.173 --> 02:19:26.979
dangle from behind one side.

02:19:26.979 --> 02:19:29.586
SAM: We've been made! Turn over the place.

02:19:29.586 --> 02:19:32.052
MATT: (hissing)

02:19:32.052 --> 02:19:33.693
LAURA: Oh no. Hit the deck!

02:19:33.693 --> 02:19:38.406
MATT: This room begins to fill with a very faint
fume.

02:19:38.406 --> 02:19:40.119
SAM: Hold your breath.

02:19:40.119 --> 02:19:46.226
LAURA: We hold our breath! I take out the paint
and I paint a hole in the bottom of the floor. In!

02:19:46.226 --> 02:19:50.423
SAM: Not yet, no! Hold your breath, we've got to
look around! I'm still looking, I'm holding my

02:19:50.423 --> 02:19:57.363
breath and I'm looking. You paint, I'm looking. I
look at the book, is there anything there?

02:19:57.363 --> 02:20:02.601
MATT: Looking inside the book, there's a bunch of
scrawlings. What languages do you know?

02:20:02.601 --> 02:20:05.755
SAM: Common, Goblin, Halfling.

02:20:05.755 --> 02:20:07.777
MATT: You do not recognize any of the languages in
the book.

02:20:07.777 --> 02:20:08.816
SAM: Taking the book.

02:20:08.816 --> 02:20:09.859
MATT: You put the book inside your pocket.

02:20:09.859 --> 02:20:14.976
SAM: I'm going to go over to the desk where Jester
had pointed and start jimmying the lock on the

02:20:14.976 --> 02:20:16.610
locked thing.

02:20:16.610 --> 02:20:19.513
MATT: Okay. Make a lockpicking check.

02:20:19.513 --> 02:20:21.336
SAM: 15.

02:20:21.336 --> 02:20:25.061
MATT: 15? It's not opening.

02:20:25.061 --> 02:20:31.299
SAM: Pull it open. (grunt) And just: smoke!

02:20:31.299 --> 02:20:33.149
LAURA: I try to pull it open.

02:20:33.149 --> 02:20:34.863
MATT: Okay. Make a strength check.

02:20:34.863 --> 02:20:36.996
MARISHA: Come on!

02:20:36.996 --> 02:20:40.723
LAURA: 18.

02:20:40.723 --> 02:20:48.452
MATT: Okay. You pull the drawer: it breaks open.
Loudly.

02:20:48.452 --> 02:20:50.227
SAM: Sure.

02:20:50.227 --> 02:20:57.723
MATT: You pull the drawer open, look inside. It
looks like there are a few small jewelry boxes

02:20:58.381 --> 02:21:01.227
that are resting inside.

02:21:01.227 --> 02:21:04.971
SAM: Taking them all.

02:21:04.971 --> 02:21:06.847
MATT: You take them all.

02:21:06.847 --> 02:21:09.007
LAURA: I was just looking, but you can take,
okay.

02:21:09.007 --> 02:21:11.512
MATT: Okay. The drawer, do you put it back?

02:21:11.512 --> 02:21:12.705
LAURA: Sure.

02:21:12.705 --> 02:21:16.848
MATT: Okay, you shove it back in. The edges are
splintered. It is very apparently physically

02:21:16.848 --> 02:21:22.408
damaged. You also hear footsteps descending from
the outside of the door.

02:21:22.408 --> 02:21:25.898
SAM: We've got to look more!

02:21:25.898 --> 02:21:27.465
LAURA: (negative noises)

02:21:27.465 --> 02:21:30.137
SAM: Okay, get in the--

02:21:30.137 --> 02:21:31.582
LAURA: Is there a rug in the room?

02:21:31.582 --> 02:21:32.975
MATT: There is a rug, yes.

02:21:32.975 --> 02:21:36.676
LAURA: Then I pull the rug over the hole that I
just made after we go under.

02:21:36.676 --> 02:21:38.403
SAM: I'm going to grab a cloak off the thing.

02:21:38.403 --> 02:21:43.274
LAURA: Oh shit, I do the same thing, I see her do
it and I grab my thing and blow out the candle, and go.

02:21:43.274 --> 02:21:46.918
MATT: Okay. First off--

02:21:46.918 --> 02:21:49.420
TRAVIS: I don't need this in my life.

02:21:49.420 --> 02:21:52.465
SAM: Now there's a permanent hole there.

02:21:52.465 --> 02:21:54.836
MATT: What's your constitution modifiers?

02:21:54.836 --> 02:21:56.887
SAM: Modifiers? Two.

02:21:56.887 --> 02:21:57.882
LAURA: Two.

02:21:57.882 --> 02:22:02.961
MATT: Okay. With the little bit of conversation
that's there, that's reduced the time, you're just

02:22:02.961 --> 02:22:07.775
now hitting the time where your breath is starting
to hurt, so you both, holding it, dive down and

02:22:07.775 --> 02:22:09.306
then, what, you--?

02:22:09.306 --> 02:22:13.454
LAURA: As I go down the hole, I pull the rug over
the hole.

02:22:13.454 --> 02:22:15.464
MATT: Okay.

02:22:15.464 --> 02:22:17.173
LAURA: I have no idea where this takes us.

02:22:17.173 --> 02:22:24.139
MATT: As you're doing this, you hear a voice
going, "Hello?" and you hear the rattling of keys.

02:22:24.139 --> 02:22:32.033
You guys, by the way, you're down now on the lower
deck, this is the deck where most of the crewmen

02:22:32.033 --> 02:22:38.550
quarters are, and you're down in one of the
bedrooms. You glance over to the side and there's

02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:43.678
a person sleeping in the bed right there, the
blanket coiled over. They're like, (snoring).

02:22:43.678 --> 02:22:50.214
SAM: I'm going to very quietly say: Wait until you
hear a body fall above us.

02:22:50.214 --> 02:22:54.729
LAURA: (whispering) Take one of the things you
stole and put it next to them.

02:22:54.729 --> 02:22:58.734
SAM: (whispering) Okay. (normal volume) What did I
steal?

02:22:58.734 --> 02:22:59.674
TRAVIS: Jewelry boxes.

02:22:59.674 --> 02:23:00.592
MATT: A bunch of jewelry boxes.

02:23:00.592 --> 02:23:01.710
SAM: Can I open one up and see what's in it?

02:23:01.710 --> 02:23:08.020
MATT: Yeah. You look inside and there's a bunch of
jewelry, jewels; it's an actual small jewel collection.

02:23:08.020 --> 02:23:12.155
SAM: Put the jewel right on his shoulder.

02:23:12.155 --> 02:23:14.942
MATT: On the person who's sleeping?

02:23:14.942 --> 02:23:19.120
SAM: Yeah, I tuck it under the blanket, like it
was with him.

02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:19.994
LIAM: Just like Macbeth.

02:23:19.994 --> 02:23:22.137
MATT: Just the one jewel?

02:23:22.137 --> 02:23:23.779
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to keep the rest for myself.

02:23:23.845 --> 02:23:41.977
MATT: Okay, all right. You hear the door above
open. (creak, footsteps). "Hey. Anyone?" The

02:23:41.977 --> 02:23:45.359
person who's sleeping is like (snorts, grunts).

02:23:45.359 --> 02:23:47.159
SAM: We're going to crawl under his bed.

02:23:47.159 --> 02:23:49.733
MATT: Okay, both of you guys make a stealth
check.

02:23:49.733 --> 02:23:50.973
TALIESIN: You still have--

02:23:50.973 --> 02:23:55.047
LAURA: Oh no! That's okay.

02:23:55.047 --> 02:23:56.995
SAM: 23 plus ten, still?

02:23:56.995 --> 02:23:58.722
LAURA: 18. Shit.

02:23:58.722 --> 02:24:01.413
SAM: 33, I guess. Right?

02:24:01.413 --> 02:24:12.647
MATT: Okay. You both quietly duck down.
(footsteps, crash). Your carpet falls down, the

02:24:12.647 --> 02:24:18.917
guy comes plummeting through, hits the floor,
(grunts). The other guy suddenly goes, "What?!",

02:24:18.917 --> 02:24:24.207
pulls out a dagger towards the other guy, who
immediately is like (yells), goes and starts

02:24:24.207 --> 02:24:25.615
stabbing into the carpet.

02:24:25.615 --> 02:24:28.342
(yelling)

02:24:28.342 --> 02:24:34.085
MATT: Going, "What?!" Other one's like "Oh god!"
Pushes him off, and stands up, and is like,

02:24:34.085 --> 02:24:48.360
"Jesus!" You see there's a couple of stab wounds
in his chest. "Zoen, what the hell, man?" Waldok,

02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:56.726
who you saw getting the tattoo earlier from your
turtle friend. He's like, "Oh! Shit, Waldok, I

02:24:56.726 --> 02:25:03.203
"didn't know! What the fuck, don't sneak up on me!"
He wipes the blood off on the blanket. He's like,

02:25:03.203 --> 02:25:11.231
"Oh, jeez. What the fuck happened there?" He looks
up at this perfectly-carved hole in the floor.

02:25:14.461 --> 02:25:24.506
Doesn't notice the gem. He's like, "Fuck." " I'm
so sorry, mate! I didn't mean--" "Shit, what the

02:25:24.564 --> 02:25:32.808
"fuck happened?" "I don't know. It's a fucking
faulty floor or something!" "Fuck." "Well, let's

02:25:32.808 --> 02:25:42.790
"get you to a surgeon or something." He stands up
and rolls off and the blanket falls over next to

02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:52.983
you guys. (clanking) The gem does fall. Neither of
them notice it. You watch as they shuffle out of

02:25:52.983 --> 02:26:01.580
the room, and the door closes behind them, and you
guys are now in the chamber with the open hole of Avantika's--

02:26:01.580 --> 02:26:07.325
SAM: We can go back up, we can keep looking! Lift
me up!

02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:09.391
LAURA: What if the poison is still up there?

02:26:09.391 --> 02:26:12.182
SAM: I think it's probably wafted out by now.

02:26:12.182 --> 02:26:15.889
MATT: You do also hear the coughing of the man who
was stabbed.

02:26:15.889 --> 02:26:17.371
SAM: Down the hall?

02:26:17.371 --> 02:26:19.268
MATT: Yeah.

02:26:19.268 --> 02:26:20.680
SAM: Peek my head up.

02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:23.790
MATT: As he's inhaled whatever had been released
in the room.

02:26:23.790 --> 02:26:26.679
LAURA: I will lift Nott up, to peek her head
through.

02:26:26.679 --> 02:26:31.438
MATT: Okay, you peek up and look. The door that
looks inside of the chamber-- Okay, first off make

02:26:31.438 --> 02:26:34.145
a constitution saving throw.

02:26:34.145 --> 02:26:42.585
SAM: That's a natural one. Maybe I should reroll
that one, I'll do my fate die. Okay, that's

02:26:42.585 --> 02:26:45.345
slightly better: nine.

02:26:45.345 --> 02:26:49.680
(laughter)

02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:51.089
TALIESIN: We're bad at everything.

02:26:51.089 --> 02:26:52.433
LAURA: No!

02:26:52.433 --> 02:26:55.867
MATT: All right, so you are considered confused.

02:26:56.748 --> 02:26:58.650
TRAVIS: Confused is complicated.

02:26:58.650 --> 02:26:59.751
MATT: Yep.

02:26:59.751 --> 02:27:02.227
TRAVIS: He's going to tell you; you've got to roll
to see what happens.

02:27:02.227 --> 02:27:08.839
MATT: I'll tell you here in a second what's going
on now. You get the sense at this moment that the

02:27:08.839 --> 02:27:13.650
other gentleman, while coughing, managed to resist
the effect of the fume in the chamber. You did

02:27:13.650 --> 02:27:18.859
not. You do notice the doorway is still open,
because he just came inside to look, and across

02:27:18.859 --> 02:27:23.787
the way you see them both coming up the stairs,
because they're making their way up from the crew

02:27:23.787 --> 02:27:28.935
quarters, to the area near Avantika's chamber,
which is right by the deck.

02:27:28.935 --> 02:27:31.058
SAM: Tap her head: Down!

02:27:31.058 --> 02:27:32.504
LAURA: What? Okay, I bring--

02:27:32.504 --> 02:27:35.736
MATT: First, while that's happening, I'm going to
go ahead and roll a d10.

02:27:35.736 --> 02:27:37.726
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:27:37.726 --> 02:27:40.988
MATT: You can act normally. So you can do that.

02:27:40.988 --> 02:27:44.741
MARISHA: Oh my god, you're lucky!

02:27:44.741 --> 02:27:46.491
SAM: Wow!

02:27:46.491 --> 02:27:48.022
MATT: So you do.

02:27:48.022 --> 02:27:49.781
SAM: I'm going to say: Down!

02:27:49.781 --> 02:27:51.872
LAURA: I crouch down so Nott can--

02:27:51.872 --> 02:27:56.486
MATT: Okay. You both head down in the chamber.
They walk up past. Make a saving throw again. A

02:27:56.486 --> 02:27:58.163
wisdom saving throw.

02:27:58.163 --> 02:27:59.467
SAM: Wisdom now.

02:27:59.467 --> 02:28:04.069
MATT: Yes. Constitution to see that the toxin took
hold, and now it's wisdom to resist the effect.

02:28:04.069 --> 02:28:05.530
SAM: 11.

02:28:05.530 --> 02:28:09.615
MATT: That's another failure. You're both sitting
there quietly as they are walking across in front.

02:28:09.615 --> 02:28:12.946
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:28:12.946 --> 02:28:17.969
MATT: You watch as Nott-- suddenly her eyes go
wide and she begins to drool a bit, and the body

02:28:17.969 --> 02:28:21.080
locks up. You're unable to speak, unable to move.

02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:28.683
LAURA: (whispering) What? What's going on? Nott!
Shit!

02:28:28.683 --> 02:28:34.799
MATT: You hear now a little bit of raised voices
and you can now hear this on the dock. One of

02:28:34.799 --> 02:28:39.735
them's going, "What's going on?" The other one's
like, "I have to get this guy to a doctor, he got

02:28:39.735 --> 02:28:52.774
"stabbed." The other voice goes, "By fucking you,
you twat!" He's like, "I'm sorry!" "Oh, fine."

02:28:52.774 --> 02:28:58.682
They start leading him off the ship. One of the
guards begins to lead them off the docks.

02:28:58.682 --> 02:29:03.645
LAURA: Can I cast Lesser Restoration on Nott?
Nott. Snap out of it. Nott!

02:29:03.645 --> 02:29:04.735
MATT: Does Lesser Restoration--

02:29:04.735 --> 02:29:06.599
LAURA: I don't know. I didn't even look.

02:29:06.599 --> 02:29:08.182
MATT: I don't know if it does anything for this
spell.

02:29:08.182 --> 02:29:09.415
LAURA: Condition-- no.

02:29:09.415 --> 02:29:10.249
SAM: It's a condition.

02:29:10.249 --> 02:29:13.656
LAURA: One condition affecting and the condition
can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

02:29:13.656 --> 02:29:17.337
MATT: No. That does not affect it, so I need you
to make another wisdom saving throw, Nott.

02:29:17.337 --> 02:29:20.438
LIAM: Caleb probably has wandered close enough to
the boat now, and hearing--

02:29:20.438 --> 02:29:23.087
MARISHA: No, I'm daisy chaining to it, I give you
a signal.

02:29:23.087 --> 02:29:24.147
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

02:29:24.147 --> 02:29:24.986
SAM: 19.

02:29:24.986 --> 02:29:29.253
MATT: You do manage to resist the confusion
effect. Aw, I was so hoping you were going to

02:29:29.253 --> 02:29:31.021
attack her.

02:29:31.021 --> 02:29:34.820
TRAVIS: Yeah, she could be straight up like,
"Nope!"

02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:36.072
LAURA: Oh my god!

02:29:36.072 --> 02:29:37.116
MATT: Would've been fun.

02:29:37.116 --> 02:29:38.162
LAURA: What do we do?

02:29:38.162 --> 02:29:42.584
SAM: I don't know. I don't know what just
happened. This is a crazy ship.

02:29:42.584 --> 02:29:46.473
LAURA: I heard them yelling. How do we get off of
here?

02:29:46.473 --> 02:29:47.605
SAM: I don't know.

02:29:47.605 --> 02:29:49.803
LAURA: What should we do? We left a hole in the
floor.

02:29:49.803 --> 02:29:53.935
SAM: Let's call for help. Caleb, can you hear me?
We're in big trouble.

02:29:53.935 --> 02:29:56.039
MARISHA: No, me! We already went through this.

02:29:56.039 --> 02:30:01.399
SAM: We need help! We need a distraction. Is Caleb
there yet?

02:30:01.399 --> 02:30:02.930
LIAM: We've established the--

02:30:02.930 --> 02:30:04.116
MARISHA: The daisy chain.

02:30:04.116 --> 02:30:05.329
MATT: Caleb does not answer.

02:30:05.329 --> 02:30:11.640
SAM: Great. Going to try it again. Beauregard,
we're going to need a distraction to get out of here!

02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:17.391
LAURA: Nott, tell her nothing crazy, you know. You
don't want it to connect to us or anything.

02:30:17.391 --> 02:30:23.958
SAM: Mild confusion and panic, but don't-- what?

02:30:23.958 --> 02:30:27.794
LAURA: I don't know. Maybe we can just get out.

02:30:27.794 --> 02:30:29.258
SAM: We're going to disguise ourselves?

02:30:29.258 --> 02:30:30.370
LAURA: Oh, right. Okay.

02:30:30.370 --> 02:30:32.615
SAM: Hold on, I'll call you back.

02:30:32.615 --> 02:30:34.450
LAURA: What are we going to disguise ourselves
as?

02:30:34.450 --> 02:30:38.591
SAM: You were going to be Avantika and I was going
to be Ipess.

02:30:38.591 --> 02:30:40.245
LAURA: Are we still going to do that?

02:30:40.245 --> 02:30:41.719
SAM: It doesn't make any sense right now, does
it?

02:30:41.719 --> 02:30:43.892
LAURA: No, it doesn't make any more sense, though.

02:30:43.892 --> 02:30:52.937
MARISHA: I wander like a drunkard past Caleb and I
go: Oh, so distracting. Like I need distractions.

02:30:52.937 --> 02:30:56.944
LAURA: What if I make another hole in the floor
and we keep going down until we can get out.

02:30:56.944 --> 02:30:59.807
SAM: I guess she will have seen one hole by now.

02:30:59.807 --> 02:31:04.470
LIAM: Apologies to my German teacher from high
school. I start pissing on the docks and singing:

02:31:04.470 --> 02:31:09.225
Laurentia, liebe Laurentia mein.

02:31:09.225 --> 02:31:11.273
SAM: Are there any portal windows?

02:31:11.273 --> 02:31:13.519
MATT: In the room you're in right now? No.

02:31:13.519 --> 02:31:15.055
LAURA: Can I--

02:31:15.055 --> 02:31:24.570
LIAM: (singing) Am Sonntag. (speaking)
Urination. (singing) Ach wenn es doch endlich schon--

02:31:24.570 --> 02:31:27.095
SAM: I'm going to grab that jewel that was on the
floor.

02:31:27.095 --> 02:31:29.178
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a performance
check.

02:31:29.178 --> 02:31:31.290
LIAM: Okay. Well, I'm definitely pissing and
singing.

02:31:31.290 --> 02:31:32.684
MATT: Yes, you are.

02:31:32.684 --> 02:31:38.226
LIAM: Yep. I have rolled such shit tonight.

02:31:38.226 --> 02:31:39.733
MATT: So sorry buddy.

02:31:39.733 --> 02:31:43.920
LIAM: That's a five. (singing) Von Dienstag.

02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:48.560
MATT: For all that you've been drinking over the
past 24 hours, the tension has caused your bladder

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:53.344
to retain everything and you're barely eking out a
sputtering stream.

02:31:53.344 --> 02:31:57.653
LIAM: Oh, okay. Well, I'll do my best to knock
things over as I go.

02:31:57.653 --> 02:31:59.887
MATT: There isn't anything to knock over, these
are open docks.

02:31:59.887 --> 02:32:04.747
LIAM: (shouting) Hey, Macarena!

02:32:06.245 --> 02:32:07.219
MATT: All right, you guys.

02:32:07.219 --> 02:32:10.590
LAURA: Can I stand up on the bed and try to make
the hole look like it wasn't perfectly painted,

02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:11.958
like it was like broken wood?

02:32:11.958 --> 02:32:15.627
SAM: Wait, wait! Just paint wood there!

02:32:15.627 --> 02:32:16.921
LAURA: Can I do that, though?

02:32:16.921 --> 02:32:17.886
MATT: Can't paint on nothing.

02:32:17.886 --> 02:32:19.207
SAM: Fuck.

02:32:19.207 --> 02:32:23.523
LAURA: I wonder if I can use one of my pieces of
paper to like put on there and then make it wood,

02:32:23.523 --> 02:32:25.324
like, fix it.

02:32:25.324 --> 02:32:30.701
MATT: Okay, you do that and as soon as you do that
the paper falls as a plank of wood.

02:32:30.701 --> 02:32:33.367
LAURA: That's what I thought was going to happen,
but I wanted to see.

02:32:33.367 --> 02:32:34.372
SAM: No, no, no.

02:32:34.372 --> 02:32:37.182
MATT: It takes you awhile to do that. It's a few
minutes to paint the wood properly to have the

02:32:37.182 --> 02:32:38.813
effect kick in.

02:32:38.813 --> 02:32:39.533
SAM: Sure.

02:32:39.533 --> 02:32:45.540
MATT: You can mark off another two square feet. In
the time they're doing that, what are you guys doing?

02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:54.531
MARISHA: While he is being a creepo, I go over to
the two guards on the dock. This drunk piece of

02:32:54.531 --> 02:32:58.327
shit over here, he tried to attack me.

02:32:58.327 --> 02:33:02.791
MATT: One of them has already pushed past you with
a wounded man. The three of them making their way

02:33:02.791 --> 02:33:08.182
while he escorts them off of the docks, so there's
only one man left on the dock by the ship. He

02:33:08.182 --> 02:33:10.472
passes by you as well. They don't seem interested
in this.

02:33:10.472 --> 02:33:17.167
LIAM: (singing) We will, we will, rock you. Rock
you.

02:33:17.167 --> 02:33:22.311
MARISHA: So, guy who was left, that guy is an
asshole, and what's with that guy that just got

02:33:22.311 --> 02:33:26.138
stabbed? I feel very unsafe.

02:33:26.138 --> 02:33:27.892
MATT: "You feel unsafe in Darktow?"

02:33:27.892 --> 02:33:29.030
MARISHA: No, I'm just saying--

02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:30.370
MATT: "Welcome to Darktow."

02:33:30.370 --> 02:33:37.209
MARISHA: He tried to, I think, rob me? I thought,
as a pirate, that I had immunity to that? I don't

02:33:37.209 --> 02:33:39.373
know, I'm just trying--

02:33:39.373 --> 02:33:45.208
MATT: He shifts in close and he looks at you real
closely and goes, "Actually, I don't think I've

02:33:45.208 --> 02:33:46.476
"seen you around here before."

02:33:46.476 --> 02:33:50.226
MARISHA: Actually, technically, I'm new. Great to
meet you.

02:33:50.226 --> 02:33:53.240
LIAM: (singing) B-A-N-A-N-A-S!

02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:56.518
MATT: "We're going to go ahead and have a
conversation off the docks. Please follow me."

02:33:56.518 --> 02:33:57.716
MARISHA: Sure! Let's go!

02:33:57.716 --> 02:33:59.934
MATT: He pats you on the shoulder and starts
leading you off the dock.

02:33:59.934 --> 02:34:04.936
MARISHA: You're fucking welcome. Go, go, go, go,
go!

02:34:04.936 --> 02:34:08.120
SAM: How's her painting going?

02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:13.184
MATT: Still going. It's taking her a few minutes.
You're still doing your distraction. Travis,

02:34:13.184 --> 02:34:15.521
you're doing good.

02:34:15.521 --> 02:34:18.880
LAURA: Good show.

02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:26.745
TRAVIS: I'll open the door. Is there any ice? No?
Okay.

02:34:26.745 --> 02:34:33.855
MATT: A few moments pass. When you finish
painting, the wood falls. While that's happening,

02:34:33.855 --> 02:34:41.859
that moment is occurring, you and Yasha, in the
tavern, are keeping an eye. You watch as one of

02:34:41.859 --> 02:34:48.732
the crewmates comes walking in rather rapidly and
goes and talks to somebody in the corner that you

02:34:48.732 --> 02:34:50.875
recognize from Avantika's crew.

02:34:50.875 --> 02:34:54.559
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to join in really
quickly. Is everything all right? You guys need

02:34:54.559 --> 02:34:57.528
anything? I've been sober all evening so I'm happy
to help.

02:34:57.528 --> 02:34:59.976
MATT: "I heard Waldok got stabbed for some
reason."

02:34:59.976 --> 02:35:01.478
TALIESIN: Who got stabbed?

02:35:01.478 --> 02:35:02.758
MATT: "Waldok!"

02:35:02.758 --> 02:35:04.961
TALIESIN: Waldok got stabbed? But Waldok's so
nice!

02:35:04.961 --> 02:35:06.072
MATT: "I know!"

02:35:06.072 --> 02:35:07.743
TALIESIN: Who would stab Waldock? That's
terrible!

02:35:07.743 --> 02:35:09.278
MATT: "Exactly! I'm curious!"

02:35:09.278 --> 02:35:15.758
TALIESIN: Where did you hear this from? Where did
this come down from?

02:35:15.758 --> 02:35:19.565
MATT: "I saw him! He got stabbed! Right out
there!" and he points out the door and you can see

02:35:19.565 --> 02:35:22.702
him motioning towards the bar.

02:35:22.702 --> 02:35:25.480
TALIESIN: Oh, he seems okay, I guess.

02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:27.532
MATT: You seem him bleeding out.

02:35:27.532 --> 02:35:30.525
TALIESIN: Come here, we're going to patch you
right up. C'mon. I'll take care of this.

02:35:30.525 --> 02:35:32.752
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:35:32.752 --> 02:35:38.531
TALIESIN: Everybody come on, let's do this. Yeah,
how bad is it?

02:35:38.531 --> 02:35:48.735
MATT: I mean, he's not dead, but for his level of
life experience, he's taken a significant amount

02:35:48.735 --> 02:35:52.091
of damage and if left it will probably eventually
get infected.

02:35:52.091 --> 02:35:56.670
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to give him a level two
Cure Wounds to get him going. That'd ought to heal

02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:58.039
him, right?

02:35:58.039 --> 02:35:59.468
MATT: Go for it and roll.

02:35:59.468 --> 02:36:09.617
TALIESIN: All right, let's do a level two. Let's
see what that looks like. That's 2d8. Don't know

02:36:09.617 --> 02:36:14.518
why I'm being so fuddy-duddy about this. Do I get
a specialty-- no, it's only when I'm healing

02:36:14.518 --> 02:36:22.190
myself. Okay, 18.

02:36:22.190 --> 02:36:26.117
MATT: That's enough to bring him back. You
concentrate on him, he winces and you watch as the

02:36:26.117 --> 02:36:34.341
wounds close up. There's no mark, no scarring. He
looks at the wound and goes, "Mr. Clay, thank you

02:36:34.341 --> 02:36:35.505
"very much."

02:36:35.505 --> 02:36:39.594
TALIESIN: Okay, you're going to want to sit down.
Take it easy for a while. I wouldn't get up for

02:36:39.594 --> 02:36:48.222
like a good half hour. Be very gentle on yourself.
Why don't we get this man a drink?

02:36:48.222 --> 02:36:56.018
MATT: "I appreciate that. You're too kind,
really." Zoen goes "See? No hard feelings, right?"

02:36:56.018 --> 02:37:01.707
and Waldock decks him across the chin. Zoen falls
to the ground grabbing the side of his face.

02:37:01.707 --> 02:37:03.073
TALIESIN: Why don't you get that man a drink?

02:37:03.073 --> 02:37:07.736
MATT: "I think I'm going to do that." He gets up.
While that's happening, and that's happening, and

02:37:07.736 --> 02:37:08.654
that's happening.

02:37:08.654 --> 02:37:10.979
LIAM: (singing) Hast du etwas Zeit fur mich?

02:37:10.979 --> 02:37:12.208
MATT: What are you guys doing?

02:37:12.208 --> 02:37:16.834
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to do what I originally
planned which is to make the hole not look like a

02:37:16.834 --> 02:37:21.028
perfect hole. To make it look like the planks
broke or something?

02:37:21.028 --> 02:37:22.138
MATT: Okay.

02:37:22.138 --> 02:37:24.452
LAURA: Oh wait, no, should I do that?

02:37:24.452 --> 02:37:26.041
SAM: They're going to find a hole.

02:37:26.041 --> 02:37:29.263
LAURA: Leave the fucking hole the way it is! We'll
leave a couple gems in the bed.

02:37:29.263 --> 02:37:31.027
SAM: Two gems.

02:37:31.027 --> 02:37:32.107
LAURA: Two gems in the bed.

02:37:32.107 --> 02:37:33.932
SAM: One gem. I'll break it in two.

02:37:33.932 --> 02:37:35.943
MATT: Make a strength check.

02:37:35.943 --> 02:37:38.655
SAM: 19.

02:37:38.655 --> 02:37:41.279
MATT: It takes you a few minutes.

02:37:41.279 --> 02:37:43.203
LAURA: Oh, come on!

02:37:43.203 --> 02:37:47.945
MATT: You have to take your dagger and score it a
bit and then try and press it again. Better part

02:37:47.945 --> 02:37:51.621
of three or four minutes to try to find the right
edge to bend and break it.

02:37:51.621 --> 02:37:53.435
LAURA: No!

02:37:53.435 --> 02:37:57.438
MATT: It does eventually break unevenly into three
or four small, crumbled pieces.

02:37:57.438 --> 02:37:59.133
SAM: Leave that.

02:37:59.133 --> 02:38:00.531
TALIESIN: Someone was eating gems in bed.

02:38:00.531 --> 02:38:02.530
TRAVIS: It's even harder to spot them now.

02:38:02.530 --> 02:38:07.919
LAURA: Perfect. Now we disguise ourselves, yes?

02:38:07.919 --> 02:38:12.218
SAM: We're going to cast Disguise Self on each
other.

02:38:12.218 --> 02:38:16.125
MATT: Only on oneself, but yes.

02:38:16.125 --> 02:38:19.276
LAURA: We'll wrap our arms around each other and
then disguise ourselves.

02:38:19.276 --> 02:38:22.854
MATT: There you go. Taking the form of Avantika
and Ipess, right?

02:38:22.854 --> 02:38:24.323
LAURA: No.

02:38:24.323 --> 02:38:26.308
SAM: I'm going to be Keg.

02:38:26.308 --> 02:38:27.527
MATT: Okay.

02:38:27.527 --> 02:38:32.708
LAURA: Oh, okay. I'm going to be Molly.

02:38:32.708 --> 02:38:34.439
SAM: Great.

02:38:36.942 --> 02:38:38.719
MATT: All right.

02:38:38.719 --> 02:38:41.164
TALIESIN: That's loud. Okay. All right.

02:38:41.164 --> 02:38:42.295
LAURA: In pirate clothes.

02:38:42.295 --> 02:38:43.076
TALIESIN: Sure!

02:38:43.076 --> 02:38:44.679
SAM: Pirate Keg, Pirate Molly.

02:38:44.679 --> 02:38:45.968
LAURA: Yeah.

02:38:45.968 --> 02:38:49.011
TRAVIS: The most inconspicuous person.

02:38:49.011 --> 02:38:51.278
LAURA: With a cloak over his head!

02:38:51.278 --> 02:38:54.773
TALIESIN: Just a purple tiefling.

02:38:54.773 --> 02:38:57.492
MATT: You guys are disguised--

02:38:57.492 --> 02:39:03.195
LAURA: I did it. I already said it. Still Pass
Without A Trace. Still trying to sneak out.

02:39:03.195 --> 02:39:04.885
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:39:04.885 --> 02:39:08.308
SAM: Up on deck though, and see if anyone's
around.

02:39:08.308 --> 02:39:10.726
MATT: Make a stealth check-- sorry, a perception
check.

02:39:10.726 --> 02:39:12.085
TALIESIN: You have advantage.

02:39:12.085 --> 02:39:15.373
SAM: Perception or-- what are we?

02:39:15.373 --> 02:39:16.277
TRAVIS: Perception.

02:39:16.277 --> 02:39:17.350
SAM: 19.

02:39:17.350 --> 02:39:20.788
LAURA: 24. 22, lies.

02:39:20.788 --> 02:39:26.307
MATT: The mist makes it hard to make out much
detail. You do notice, glancing up, there is an

02:39:26.307 --> 02:39:28.052
individual in the crow's nest.

02:39:28.052 --> 02:39:30.272
SAM: (loading bow)

02:39:30.272 --> 02:39:31.659
LAURA: No.

02:39:31.659 --> 02:39:33.561
SAM: No?

02:39:33.561 --> 02:39:35.511
SAM and LAURA: Shit.

02:39:35.511 --> 02:39:37.124
SAM: How far up?

02:39:37.124 --> 02:39:44.549
MATT: I'd say about 40 to 45 feet as an
estimation.

02:39:45.744 --> 02:39:55.187
SAM: I'm going to cast Phantasmal Force on that
person, on that being.

02:39:55.526 --> 02:39:57.437
MATT: Okay.

02:39:57.437 --> 02:39:59.441
TALIESIN: I've never seen your eyes glaze over
like that Matt.

02:39:59.441 --> 02:40:00.633
TRAVIS: What does that do?

02:40:00.633 --> 02:40:05.693
MATT: All right. What's your DC?

02:40:05.693 --> 02:40:08.351
SAM: Intelligence, 14.

02:40:08.351 --> 02:40:16.012
MATT: DC 14. No, did not succeed with a natural
eight, plus two, ten.

02:40:16.541 --> 02:40:19.123
SAM: Describe the crow's nest to me?

02:40:19.123 --> 02:40:25.499
MATT: In the main mast of the ship that goes up,
the crow's nest is in itself a circular platform at

02:40:25.583 --> 02:40:31.901
the top that is used primarily for keeping a watch
on nearby land and details in the sea around, as

02:40:31.901 --> 02:40:36.162
well as direction. It's a vantage point for
someone to keep an eye on the area around the

02:40:36.162 --> 02:40:41.460
ship. There is somebody stationed up there to keep
an eye on the ship overnight. Or at least there

02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:47.711
for as long as their portion of it was. You can't
make out the details of the figure from this

02:40:47.711 --> 02:40:49.950
distance. You just see a figure there.

02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:58.545
SAM: All right, I will make the figure think that
his crow's nest has caught fire, and there are

02:40:58.545 --> 02:41:05.934
little flames licking around, creeping up the
sides of it, and surrounding it.

02:41:05.934 --> 02:41:15.691
MATT: Okay. As you finish the spell, a moment goes
by and you hear (panicked shouting) "Fuck! Shit!"

02:41:15.691 --> 02:41:22.431
You look up and you see this individual trying to
bat their cloak on the sides of this before

02:41:22.431 --> 02:41:24.523
shouting "Help!"

02:41:24.523 --> 02:41:27.080
LAURA: Run! We run.

02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:30.993
MATT: While stealthing? Or just running?

02:41:30.993 --> 02:41:33.187
SAM: Off the back of the boat.

02:41:33.187 --> 02:41:40.356
MATT: Okay. They have major disadvantage to try
and spot you because they're distracted by the flames.

02:41:40.356 --> 02:41:41.912
LAURA: Are we being stealthy?

02:41:41.912 --> 02:41:42.775
SAM: Yeah, we're stealthing.

02:41:42.775 --> 02:41:43.868
LAURA: Were stealthing.

02:41:43.868 --> 02:41:45.218
TRAVIS: Or running?

02:41:45.218 --> 02:41:46.833
SAM: No, we're stealthing.

02:41:46.833 --> 02:41:48.617
LAURA: Quickly.

02:41:48.617 --> 02:41:52.307
SAM: We're moving from--

02:41:52.307 --> 02:41:53.417
LIAM: You're stealthing.

02:41:53.417 --> 02:41:54.350
SAM and LAURA: We're stealthing!

02:41:54.350 --> 02:41:55.198
MATT: Make stealth checks.

02:41:55.198 --> 02:41:57.002
SAM: Okay.

02:41:57.002 --> 02:41:58.217
LAURA: Still Pass Without a Trace.

02:41:58.217 --> 02:42:00.145
SAM: 36.

02:42:00.145 --> 02:42:03.775
LAURA: 21.

02:42:03.775 --> 02:42:08.086
MATT: Okay. You guys both manage to scoot over to
the edge of the ship.

02:42:08.086 --> 02:42:11.223
SAM: The seaward side.

02:42:11.223 --> 02:42:13.045
MATT: The seaward side. All right, You're heading
off--

02:42:13.045 --> 02:42:13.992
LAURA: The seaward side?

02:42:13.992 --> 02:42:14.833
MATT: It'd be the starboard side.

02:42:14.833 --> 02:42:18.619
SAM: Yes. The side away from the docks.

02:42:18.619 --> 02:42:24.870
MATT: Correct. You head over to that which is the
starboard side of the ship. There's the ocean

02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:29.348
below you. A person screaming up top and getting
more and more frantic.

02:42:29.348 --> 02:42:30.275
SAM: Jump in!

02:42:30.275 --> 02:42:33.217
LAURA: Put that book in the bag so it doesn't get
wet.

02:42:33.217 --> 02:42:35.100
MARISHA: Why did I get arrested?

02:42:35.100 --> 02:42:37.645
LAURA: I don't know.

02:42:37.645 --> 02:42:41.137
LIAM: None of us knew about the crow's nest
person.

02:42:41.137 --> 02:42:42.349
LAURA: We jump in.

02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:43.844
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately perception wasn't high
enough.

02:42:43.844 --> 02:42:46.613
LIAM: (drunken singing)

02:42:46.613 --> 02:42:48.204
SAM: We're jumping in.

02:42:48.204 --> 02:42:53.478
MATT: You both leap off the side into the freezing
cold ocean water.

02:42:53.478 --> 02:42:55.623
LAURA: Let's try to go in quietly.

02:42:55.623 --> 02:42:56.854
MATT: Still going to make a splash.

02:42:56.854 --> 02:42:58.434
SAM: Baby seal style.

02:42:58.434 --> 02:43:02.395
MATT: Thankfully, it's mostly drowned out by the
sound of the screaming from the top of the crow's

02:43:02.395 --> 02:43:07.099
nest. As you both break the surface and glance
around the vicinity, you can see some of the

02:43:07.099 --> 02:43:10.424
torches that are shifting from the other parts of
the dock to come over and see this commotion

02:43:10.424 --> 02:43:19.824
that's happening. The screams get more and more
intense before they end with a (yell) (impact). As

02:43:19.824 --> 02:43:23.277
this person felt there was no other recourse with
the flames gathering around them.

02:43:23.277 --> 02:43:27.487
Then you hear (screaming).

02:43:27.487 --> 02:43:32.239
SAM: Swim away. I'll hold your hand as I walk away
on the water.

02:43:32.239 --> 02:43:34.914
TRAVIS: I'm in a great deal of pain!

02:43:34.914 --> 02:43:40.097
MATT: Yeah, whoever it was, they landed. They're
alive, but they're not doing that well. They broke

02:43:40.097 --> 02:43:41.959
something on the way down.

02:43:41.959 --> 02:43:43.484
TALIESIN: How's that charisma bonus working out
for you?

02:43:43.484 --> 02:43:45.018
SAM: I'm lying great.

02:43:45.018 --> 02:43:47.175
LAURA: This is going perfectly.

02:43:47.175 --> 02:43:49.170
MARISHA: You shot me!

02:43:50.862 --> 02:43:55.526
MATT: Now the screaming is less frantic and more a
pained scream while the rest of the various

02:43:55.526 --> 02:44:00.429
watchers of the dock start making their way over,
while you guys are swimming?

02:44:00.429 --> 02:44:04.334
TALIESIN: I'm wet and upset! Why did you do
that?!

02:44:04.334 --> 02:44:06.469
SAM: Just away and around.

02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:12.639
MATT: Okay, so you're probably following under the
docks. All right. Both of you guys make an

02:44:12.639 --> 02:44:15.475
athletics check.

02:44:15.475 --> 02:44:18.724
TALIESIN: He's walking. She's swimming.

02:44:18.724 --> 02:44:19.889
MATT: That's right, you're walking.

02:44:19.889 --> 02:44:22.156
LAURA: Oh my god, that was almost a one. But it's
not. It's a 19.

02:44:22.156 --> 02:44:23.446
MATT: Actually, you didn't have to make it because
you're walking.

02:44:23.446 --> 02:44:24.316
LAURA: 19.

02:44:24.316 --> 02:44:30.805
MATT: 19! All right. The water, as it's coming in,
the waves are crashing against the rocky edge and

02:44:30.805 --> 02:44:33.048
shore of Darktow Isle right here.

02:44:33.048 --> 02:44:34.513
LAURA: Don't let go, Nott!

02:44:34.513 --> 02:44:38.196
SAM: I won't ever let go!

02:44:38.196 --> 02:44:42.182
MATT: One end of the docks, you can hear the
footsteps passing overhead.

02:44:42.182 --> 02:44:44.115
SAM: Oh god! I'm letting go!

02:44:44.115 --> 02:44:47.875
MATT: They pass by. You guys make it over to the
edge of the rocks and, with the water pushing, you

02:44:47.875 --> 02:44:53.965
manage to not be dashed against the rocks to any
point of personal injury. You manage to climb up.

02:44:53.965 --> 02:44:58.415
I need you both to make a stealth check to try to
make your way back onto land without being sighted

02:44:58.415 --> 02:45:00.426
by any of the nearby guard.

02:45:01.585 --> 02:45:03.608
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:45:03.608 --> 02:45:04.791
SAM: 38.

02:45:04.791 --> 02:45:07.557
(relieved groaning)

02:45:07.557 --> 02:45:10.990
MATT: All right. You both are-- oh, you're soaking
wet.

02:45:10.990 --> 02:45:12.989
LAURA: But Disguise Self, to where we look dry.

02:45:12.989 --> 02:45:14.138
SAM: I'm probably a bit wet too.

02:45:14.138 --> 02:45:15.474
MATT: Actually, yeah, because you dove into the
water before jumping in.

02:45:15.474 --> 02:45:16.293
SAM: Yeah, I'm wet.

02:45:16.293 --> 02:45:17.617
MATT: Otherwise you'd have taken the impact damage
from that.

02:45:17.617 --> 02:45:19.872
TRAVIS: (impact)

02:45:19.872 --> 02:45:23.587
TALIESIN: Unless you'd have taken that dex bonus,
and then nothing would have happened at all!

02:45:23.587 --> 02:45:25.049
MATT: That's true.

02:45:25.049 --> 02:45:26.280
TALIESIN: But you didn't.

02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:26.821
SAM: Nope.

02:45:26.821 --> 02:45:31.104
MATT: It's all good. You both climb up on there,
dripping a bit wet, you especially soaking. A lot

02:45:31.104 --> 02:45:35.615
of the guards and the torches are making their way
there, other ones are still starting to make sure

02:45:35.615 --> 02:45:39.116
they aren't losing track of their post. What are
you guys doing?

02:45:39.116 --> 02:45:48.806
SAM: I mean, just calmly walking away, right? Are
there lots more people coming?

02:45:48.806 --> 02:45:53.388
MATT: They're coming toward the screaming and
yelling. There are still others there that are

02:45:53.388 --> 02:45:57.055
patrolling and keeping an eye. They don't all of a
sudden go: Someone's yelling! Everyone lose their post!

02:45:57.055 --> 02:45:58.408
LAURA: Do you think I seem noticeable?

02:45:58.408 --> 02:45:59.167
SAM: No, you look great.

02:45:59.167 --> 02:45:59.994
TALIESIN: You're both wet.

02:45:59.994 --> 02:46:02.221
LAURA: Yeah, but we're Disguise Self, so we look
dry.

02:46:02.221 --> 02:46:04.544
MATT: That's true.

02:46:04.544 --> 02:46:09.638
SAM: You look great. Do I look okay? Light my
cigarette.

02:46:09.638 --> 02:46:14.167
LAURA: Yeah, I feel like you may be less
noticeable than a purple me.

02:46:14.167 --> 02:46:15.905
SAM: You've got a cloak on.

02:46:15.905 --> 02:46:16.776
LAURA: Okay.

02:46:16.776 --> 02:46:19.354
LIAM: It's pandemonium on the docks, right? At
this point?

02:46:19.354 --> 02:46:22.494
MATT: It's borderline, but it's starting to calm a
bit. Some of them have gotten up there, and they

02:46:22.494 --> 02:46:26.990
found the hurt guy. The spell lasts for how long?

02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:29.296
SAM: Disguise Self? Or--

02:46:29.296 --> 02:46:30.894
MATT: No, the--

02:46:30.894 --> 02:46:33.294
SAM: Oh. The Phantasmal Force?

02:46:33.294 --> 02:46:39.005
MATT: Correct. For one minute, so it's faded by
now. As you guys are walking by, you hear the

02:46:39.005 --> 02:46:42.639
guards going like, "What's wrong?" He's like,
"Ugh! I'm hurt!" He looks up and goes, "But it was

02:46:42.639 --> 02:46:53.864
"on-- It was burning! What the fuck?!" He's
confused and in pain and lamenting why he jumped

02:46:53.864 --> 02:46:58.880
and what's going on. The guards are trying to calm
him a bit, and they're now starting to think

02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:04.104
something's up. You can see, now somebody is
giving out directions to the other guards.

02:47:04.104 --> 02:47:09.227
Something is definitely not right, and the docks
are now going into heightened search mode.

02:47:09.227 --> 02:47:12.886
SAM: Let's get the fuck out of here, right?

02:47:12.886 --> 02:47:14.304
LAURA: Yeah.

02:47:14.304 --> 02:47:17.118
SAM: We're just going to calmly walk into town? I
don't know.

02:47:17.118 --> 02:47:21.124
MATT: Okay. While you guys are doing that, Caleb,
you see all this happening.

02:47:21.124 --> 02:47:25.439
LIAM: Yeah, I would have quieted down with the
singing and just tried to go more lowkey. I don't

02:47:25.439 --> 02:47:27.624
know what's going on, so I'm still watching the
boat.

02:47:27.624 --> 02:47:29.178
MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check.

02:47:29.178 --> 02:47:35.294
LIAM: And one eye on the Loaded Underwear-- What's
it called? The Bloated--

02:47:35.294 --> 02:47:36.377
TRAVIS: Bloated Cup?

02:47:36.377 --> 02:47:40.883
LIAM: Bloated Cup. Fjord's Bloated Cup. What did
you say? Perception?

02:47:40.883 --> 02:47:41.763
MATT: Yes.

02:47:41.763 --> 02:47:43.163
LIAM: Still rolling shit tonight. 12.

02:47:43.163 --> 02:47:45.845
MATT: 12, okay. You're just watching this whole
thing unfold.

02:47:45.845 --> 02:47:49.169
LIAM: Boat. Bloated Cup. Back and forth. Waiting.

02:47:49.169 --> 02:47:53.022
MATT: You're lead back to the top of the docks.
The figure has their hand on your shoulder and

02:47:53.022 --> 02:47:59.159
calls over somebody else. He goes, "Hey, Waynon!
Looks like we got someone who's stowed away here

02:47:59.159 --> 02:48:01.258
"to Darktow."

02:48:01.258 --> 02:48:03.805
MARISHA: I say: Sup, Waynen?

02:48:03.805 --> 02:48:06.695
MATT: He looks over to you and goes, "What's your
business?"

02:48:06.695 --> 02:48:11.855
MARISHA: I'm with Avantika's crew. You can ask her
if you want, but I don't think you really want to.

02:48:11.855 --> 02:48:16.346
Pretty sure she's above your pay grade, am I
right?

02:48:16.346 --> 02:48:19.115
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:48:19.115 --> 02:48:25.518
MARISHA: Great fucking intimidation. Nine.

02:48:25.518 --> 02:48:34.681
MATT: Nine? He doesn't appear to be shaken by it,
but at least he finds a bit of truth to what

02:48:34.681 --> 02:48:38.844
you're saying. He's like, "Let her go."

02:48:38.844 --> 02:48:40.912
MARISHA: That's right.

02:48:40.912 --> 02:48:47.164
MATT: "Don't go wandering these docks at night by
yourself for no fucking reason."

02:48:47.164 --> 02:48:52.549
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry. Are you afraid I'm going
to stub a toe in the middle of the night?

02:48:52.549 --> 02:48:54.076
MATT: He just turns around and walks away.

02:48:54.076 --> 02:48:56.247
LIAM: Quit while you're ahead, motherfucker.

02:48:56.247 --> 02:48:58.352
MARISHA: Beau never does.

02:48:58.887 --> 02:49:04.828
MATT: You guys start heading back, tracking this
trail of seawater behind you on the docks.

02:49:04.828 --> 02:49:11.840
Eventually, Beau, you turn around and you see
Molly and Keg walking your way.

02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:18.866
MARISHA: I just go: Oh fuck. I just keep walking
like I don't know who they are and I pass by them

02:49:18.866 --> 02:49:21.124
with a glance.

02:49:21.124 --> 02:49:25.985
SAM: Good evening, madam.

02:49:25.985 --> 02:49:27.372
MARISHA: Fuck you.

02:49:27.372 --> 02:49:31.916
(laughter)

02:49:31.916 --> 02:49:34.926
TRAVIS: No smoke coming out of the cigarette.

02:49:34.926 --> 02:49:38.141
SAM: Dripping wet.

02:49:39.928 --> 02:49:48.162
MATT: All right. You all eventually reconvene. You
eventually complete your time with the captain.

02:49:48.162 --> 02:49:58.091
TRAVIS: (door slamming) (heavy breathing) I look
down the stairs. Can I see Caduceus down there?

02:49:58.091 --> 02:50:01.907
MATT: If you passed by Bouldergut and you looked
down, yeah. Caduceus is down there. He's actually

02:50:01.907 --> 02:50:04.899
in a healthy conversation with one of the members
of the group.

02:50:04.974 --> 02:50:11.964
TALIESIN: Talking to the guy. We're bonding, man.
These guys are pretty okay once you get to know them.

02:50:11.964 --> 02:50:16.943
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll come down and-- A drink?

02:50:16.943 --> 02:50:19.889
MATT: A round is brought to you.

02:50:19.889 --> 02:50:22.444
TALIESIN: Weird night.

02:50:22.444 --> 02:50:28.548
TRAVIS: Hey, Deucey. How we doing?

02:50:29.367 --> 02:50:37.196
TALIESIN: Well, everything's not quiet on this
end. One of our kids apparently got stabbed by--

02:50:37.196 --> 02:50:43.689
Well, one of the crew stabbed the other crew. I
can't imagine why that happened. There's been no

02:50:43.689 --> 02:50:48.254
word, but I assume it's just probably pandemonium
all over.

02:50:48.254 --> 02:50:52.903
TRAVIS: Oh, good report.

02:50:52.903 --> 02:50:57.444
TALIESIN: Everyone's pretty happy, though. You
should come down and have a drink with everybody.

02:50:57.444 --> 02:51:01.401
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll just hold my cup and wait for
something to happen.

02:51:01.401 --> 02:51:03.674
LAURA: Is anybody in the shit alley?

02:51:03.674 --> 02:51:04.773
MATT: No.

02:51:04.773 --> 02:51:06.686
LAURA: We should probably drop our forms.

02:51:06.686 --> 02:51:08.268
SAM: And dry off.

02:51:08.268 --> 02:51:11.628
LAURA: Yeah. In the shit alley.

02:51:11.628 --> 02:51:18.012
MATT: Okay. In the shit alley, as it has now been
deemed, you drop your various disguises.

02:51:18.012 --> 02:51:20.245
SAM: Are we still soaking wet?

02:51:20.245 --> 02:51:21.985
MATT: I mean, you're damp.

02:51:21.985 --> 02:51:28.075
SAM: Like a dog, I'll shake it off a little bit.
Do you have any spells that can make us dry?

02:51:28.075 --> 02:51:31.092
TALIESIN: I hope someone has followed this right
back to the inn, so that's good.

02:51:31.092 --> 02:51:32.594
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god!

02:51:32.594 --> 02:51:34.987
SAM: Oh no, your weasel's dead again, isn't it?

02:51:34.987 --> 02:51:40.619
LAURA: No. Nott, I have Mending.

02:51:40.619 --> 02:51:42.252
SAM: What's that? What does that do?

02:51:42.252 --> 02:51:46.035
LAURA: It's a cantrip and I can mend things that
have holes in them.

02:51:46.035 --> 02:51:48.568
LIAM: Not a giant hole.

02:51:48.568 --> 02:51:53.813
LAURA: Not a hole that big. It wouldn't have
worked on a hole that big.

02:51:53.813 --> 02:51:59.737
SAM: Are you saying to me that we made a mistake?

02:52:01.663 --> 02:52:03.154
LAURA: Everything we did was perfect.

02:52:03.154 --> 02:52:04.131
SAM: I agree!

02:52:04.131 --> 02:52:05.416
LAURA: I mean, it went according to plan.

02:52:05.416 --> 02:52:06.469
SAM: We got a book!

02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:09.050
LAURA: Shh, hide that. That's in my bag, anyway.

02:52:09.050 --> 02:52:10.480
SAM: We got some jewels.

02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:12.032
LAURA: Oh! We need to hide those too.

02:52:12.032 --> 02:52:13.689
SAM: These are hot ice! We got to get rid of
these.

02:52:13.689 --> 02:52:18.296
LAURA: What the fuck are we going to do? If she
searches our shit, she's going to know that we stole.

02:52:18.296 --> 02:52:22.604
SAM: I know. Don't worry. We're going to plant
them on Allison. Everything's going to be fine,

02:52:22.604 --> 02:52:24.654
don't worry.

02:52:24.654 --> 02:52:27.360
LAURA: We got to figure this out, like stat.

02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:32.692
SAM: Figured. Done. Mage Hand. Allison's pocket.
We're clean.

02:52:32.692 --> 02:52:34.350
LAURA: All right.

02:52:34.350 --> 02:52:36.410
SAM: Hey, you did good in there.

02:52:36.410 --> 02:52:37.892
LAURA: You did too, you're pretty cool!

02:52:37.892 --> 02:52:39.546
SAM: Yeah, we're pretty great.

02:52:39.546 --> 02:52:43.033
LAURA: Okay. We're going to go into our rooms.

02:52:43.033 --> 02:52:50.086
LIAM: Charlie Adler busts into the inn and sees
Caduceus and just stops the door and pulls out a

02:52:50.086 --> 02:52:54.547
little wire and says: I don't know where anybody
is. We have to go to the boat now! Come on!

02:52:54.547 --> 02:52:55.847
SAM: Who are you talking to?

02:52:55.847 --> 02:52:56.714
LIAM: Caduceus.

02:52:56.714 --> 02:52:58.150
MARISHA: Not to the boat! Never to the boat!

02:52:58.150 --> 02:53:00.150
LIAM: No one told Caleb shit.

02:53:00.150 --> 02:53:02.902
MARISHA: You saw a lot of shit go down at the
boat!

02:53:02.902 --> 02:53:08.711
LIAM: No, I saw people running to the boat in
danger and you lead off. Pandemonium on the ship

02:53:08.711 --> 02:53:10.348
and fire on the ship!

02:53:10.348 --> 02:53:15.415
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what. Obviously whatever
went down-- we're going to just go make sure

02:53:15.415 --> 02:53:20.309
everything's copacetic back at the boat. We'll be
back in just a couple minutes. Just going to make

02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:21.401
sure everything--

02:53:21.401 --> 02:53:22.641
MATT: "Okay. Good luck."

02:53:22.641 --> 02:53:28.432
TALIESIN: Yeah. We'll let you know. I'll walk
brazenly down to the ship with you.

02:53:28.432 --> 02:53:33.194
MATT: Okay. As you step out of the inn, you watch
Nott and Jester walking towards it.

02:53:33.194 --> 02:53:34.658
LIAM: They dropped their shit?

02:53:34.658 --> 02:53:35.462
MATT: They did.

02:53:35.462 --> 02:53:36.729
LIAM: (protestant noise)

02:53:36.729 --> 02:53:37.498
LAURA: Hi!

02:53:37.498 --> 02:53:38.454
TALIESIN: We'll go check it out anyway.

02:53:38.454 --> 02:53:39.843
SAM: Don't worry.

02:53:39.843 --> 02:53:42.642
LAURA: You're going down there? Don't go down
there, Caduceus.

02:53:42.642 --> 02:53:43.538
TALIESIN: I'm going down.

02:53:43.538 --> 02:53:44.774
LAURA: No, there's guards everywhere!

02:53:44.774 --> 02:53:48.315
MATT: Beau, you probably approached right before
they did.

02:53:48.315 --> 02:53:50.084
MARISHA: Sup, guys. How was your night walk?

02:53:50.084 --> 02:53:51.399
LIAM: It went very well, I take it.

02:53:51.399 --> 02:53:56.020
MATT: Fjord, you're sitting over and you watch
them all talking just outside of the inn.

02:53:56.020 --> 02:53:57.601
SAM: There was a little hiccup.

02:53:57.601 --> 02:53:59.066
LAURA: Schmidle of a one.

02:53:59.066 --> 02:54:00.304
SAM: But we took care of it.

02:54:00.304 --> 02:54:02.460
MARISHA: Shh. Who's around?

02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:05.095
MATT: I mean, there are guards walking--

02:54:05.095 --> 02:54:09.779
TALIESIN: Do I see a commotion from here?

02:54:09.779 --> 02:54:15.627
MATT: The commotion seems to have died down at the
moment.

02:54:15.627 --> 02:54:22.278
TALIESIN: Nothing crazy going on on our ship? I
don't see some figures or anything?

02:54:22.278 --> 02:54:25.742
MATT: Make a perception check from this distance.
I'd say with disadvantage from this distance.

02:54:25.742 --> 02:54:27.086
TALIESIN: Really?

02:54:27.086 --> 02:54:28.156
MATT: Yeah.

02:54:28.156 --> 02:54:35.395
TALIESIN: I would never. Well, that's fine because
even with a-- (counting) 22 with disadvantage.

02:54:35.395 --> 02:54:40.542
(laughter)

02:54:40.542 --> 02:54:44.312
TALIESIN: I love this. This is the best character
ever.

02:54:44.312 --> 02:54:52.013
MATT: Glancing over, you don't see any
torch-bearing guards, but you do see a figure that

02:54:52.013 --> 02:54:56.747
is doing a visual pass on the deck of the ship.

02:54:56.747 --> 02:55:00.900
TALIESIN: I might see if there's a torch-bearer
walking around really quickly.

02:55:00.900 --> 02:55:04.695
MATT: You see one that's maybe 25, 30 feet from
you that's just walking through the street.

02:55:04.695 --> 02:55:07.461
TALIESIN: Excuse me, sir.

02:55:07.461 --> 02:55:09.648
MATT: Turns around. "Hey."

02:55:09.648 --> 02:55:15.208
TALIESIN: We had a little trouble on our ship
earlier. I was curious if everything was all

02:55:15.208 --> 02:55:17.685
right. I heard a little commotion.

02:55:17.685 --> 02:55:21.717
MATT: "I don't know. It's not my jurisdiction
tonight."

02:55:21.717 --> 02:55:29.963
TALIESIN: Well, if I wanted to find out what went
down do you know who I would talk to?

02:55:29.963 --> 02:55:33.210
MATT: "Probably one of the guys closer to the
ship."

02:55:33.210 --> 02:55:34.414
TALIESIN: I'll be right back.

02:55:34.414 --> 02:55:35.094
MATT: "Okay."

02:55:35.094 --> 02:55:36.845
TALIESIN: I'm going to go find a guard and ask
them what's up.

02:55:36.845 --> 02:55:37.936
MATT: Okay.

02:55:37.936 --> 02:55:43.418
SAM: Hey, just throwing it out there, there seemed
to be a couple of loose ends that we need to tie

02:55:43.418 --> 02:55:47.883
up. Can you make us an alibi?

02:55:47.883 --> 02:55:49.492
LAURA: What do you mean?

02:55:49.492 --> 02:55:55.796
SAM: Like, suggest to someone that we were
drinking with them all night, in case it's asked?

02:55:55.796 --> 02:55:57.520
LAURA: They'll know.

02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:01.750
SAM: Oh, well then don't do that. Never mind.

02:56:01.750 --> 02:56:06.842
MARISHA: Who's really drunk, though? Is there
someone real drunk?

02:56:06.842 --> 02:56:09.691
SAM: I assume a lot of people down there.

02:56:09.691 --> 02:56:12.603
MARISHA: Is anyone real drunk? Look real drunk in
the tavern?

02:56:12.603 --> 02:56:15.287
MATT: Make a perception check. Or actually, this
would be an insight check.

02:56:15.287 --> 02:56:18.624
MARISHA: That was part of our crew. Part of the
Squalleater.

02:56:18.624 --> 02:56:20.100
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:56:20.100 --> 02:56:27.505
MARISHA: Jesus. That's a natural one.

02:56:27.505 --> 02:56:32.525
MATT: You only see one figure you recognize from
the crew.

02:56:32.525 --> 02:56:34.793
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. It's a four. Ten?

02:56:34.793 --> 02:56:39.082
MATT: Okay. You only see one figure that you
recognize from the crew and they are recovering

02:56:39.082 --> 02:56:43.466
from a series of stab wounds and are deep in their
cups.

02:56:43.466 --> 02:56:46.960
MARISHA: Oh. What's-his-name.

02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:50.415
MATT: Waldok.

02:56:50.415 --> 02:57:02.080
MARISHA: I sit down next to Waldok with another
drink and hand him a drink.

02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:05.142
MATT: He takes it and goes, "Thanks!" (hiccup)

02:57:05.142 --> 02:57:12.757
MARISHA: Holy shit, man. I am so sorry we couldn't
have been there to protect you from these attackers.

02:57:12.757 --> 02:57:16.919
MATT: "Attackers? It's just fucking him." He
points over at the other guy who's just like,

02:57:16.919 --> 02:57:22.730
"Stop rubbing it in. I'm sorry! You fucking jumped
into the middle of my room at night while I was

02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:28.145
"sleeping. What else am I supposed to do?" He's
like, "Not stab me, asshole!"

02:57:28.145 --> 02:57:29.807
MARISHA: Who's the other guy's name?

02:57:29.807 --> 02:57:31.307
MATT: "That's Zoen."

02:57:31.307 --> 02:57:36.409
MARISHA: I'm sorry we couldn't have been there to
protect you from Zoen. What a dick. I mean, we

02:57:36.409 --> 02:57:42.173
were here all night fucking trashed, so-- If we
had only been there.

02:57:42.173 --> 02:57:46.453
SAM: The best.

02:57:46.453 --> 02:57:49.429
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:57:49.824 --> 02:57:56.640
LIAM: The slow creep on your face, Matt! Come on,
high!

02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:01.704
MARISHA: 15? Could've been better.

02:58:02.156 --> 02:58:10.786
MATT: Okay, you talk to them, about how you're sad
you couldn't have been there. You can see Waldok's like--

02:58:10.786 --> 02:58:12.350
MARISHA: We were drunk. Here.

02:58:12.350 --> 02:58:17.591
MATT: Waldok's not really caring as much, more
just like, "No, it's fucking his fault!" and

02:58:17.591 --> 02:58:24.378
Zoen's like, "Oversharing?" Caduceus?

02:58:24.378 --> 02:58:27.364
TALIESIN: I just want to find out what was up from
somebody.

02:58:27.364 --> 02:58:32.780
MATT: One of the guards is keeping an eye over
there with the torch. He's like, "Yeah, it looks

02:58:32.780 --> 02:58:38.837
"like there's a break-in of some sort; a guy was
stabbed, got him safe. Another man broke his

02:58:38.837 --> 02:58:41.898
"fucking leg and he's being taken care of."

02:58:41.898 --> 02:58:46.531
TALIESIN: Really? Does he need healing? I can do
that, or otherwise.

02:58:46.531 --> 02:58:48.720
MATT: "Sure, I guess. This way."

02:58:48.720 --> 02:58:50.675
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll take care of it real quick.

02:58:50.675 --> 02:58:53.391
MATT: He brings you over to the dock and you look
over and there's this guy, you know his name is

02:58:53.391 --> 02:58:58.548
Bart, he's one of the deckhands, and he's over on
the side right now just going (pained groaning)

02:58:58.548 --> 02:59:02.086
and you can see, it's snapped. Like, bone
protruded and everything.

02:59:02.086 --> 02:59:03.522
TRAVIS: Oh, compound!

02:59:03.522 --> 02:59:06.381
TALIESIN: Oh in that case, Healing Word, level
three.

02:59:06.381 --> 02:59:08.035
MATT: Okay, you may have to set the bone first.

02:59:08.035 --> 02:59:10.352
ALL: Woo!

02:59:10.352 --> 02:59:11.650
MATT: Make a medicine check.

02:59:11.650 --> 02:59:12.959
TALIESIN: Make a medicine check?

02:59:12.959 --> 02:59:16.059
SAM: Don't accidentally turn it to fungus.

02:59:17.100 --> 02:59:21.854
TALIESIN: Yeah, that'll do, that's a 23.

02:59:21.854 --> 02:59:23.242
LAURA: Oh.

02:59:23.242 --> 02:59:24.874
TALIESIN: I love this character so much.

02:59:24.874 --> 02:59:27.421
MATT: You walk up to him and he's like, "No no no
no!"

02:59:27.421 --> 02:59:28.585
TALIESIN: It's all right.

02:59:28.585 --> 02:59:30.022
MATT: (pained gasp) (relieved gasp)

02:59:30.022 --> 02:59:31.097
TALIESIN: There you go.

02:59:31.097 --> 02:59:36.598
MATT: (gasp) He looks down and you can see there's
a wave of relief on him as he doesn't have this

02:59:36.598 --> 02:59:43.218
like protruding fracture. It's set. Still, you can
see the bone, but it's much better-looking than it was.

02:59:43.218 --> 02:59:46.117
TALIESIN: Let's give him a Cure Wounds level three
just to--

02:59:46.117 --> 02:59:47.160
MATT: Go for it.

02:59:47.160 --> 02:59:49.999
TALIESIN: Or, what does he look like, a level two
or a level three to you?

02:59:49.999 --> 02:59:52.718
MATT: With that medicine check? A level two should
be sufficient.

02:59:52.718 --> 02:59:56.001
TALIESIN: A level two should be sufficient. All
right. Let's just take care of this. Can you tell

02:59:56.001 --> 02:59:58.438
me what happened, son?

02:59:58.438 --> 03:00:02.963
MATT: "I don't know. I was up in the crow's nest
and suddenly it--"

03:00:02.963 --> 03:00:04.223
TALIESIN: 21.

03:00:04.223 --> 03:00:09.808
MATT: 21? "Suddenly it's-- oh my god. Thank you!"

03:00:09.808 --> 03:00:12.023
TALIESIN: While you were up the crow's nest, what
happened?

03:00:12.023 --> 03:00:16.156
MATT: "It was catching fire! I was trying to put
it out, but it just kept growing and growing and I

03:00:16.156 --> 03:00:18.223
"could feel the heat, and it was--"

03:00:18.223 --> 03:00:20.032
TALIESIN: It looks fine up there.

03:00:20.032 --> 03:00:21.472
MATT: "I know, I don't--"

03:00:21.472 --> 03:00:26.941
TALIESIN: What did you-- what was the last 24
hours for you? What did you?

03:00:26.941 --> 03:00:28.095
MATT: "What do you mean?"

03:00:28.095 --> 03:00:29.946
TALIESIN: I mean like, I don't-- oh, no.

03:00:29.946 --> 03:00:31.186
MATT: "What?"

03:00:31.186 --> 03:00:41.692
TALIESIN: (sighs) I may have left some of the
fruit that we picked up in our last stop in the

03:00:41.692 --> 03:00:49.587
kitchen. I don't know what you've been eating for
the last-- that's maybe my fault. I really hope it

03:00:49.587 --> 03:00:51.577
isn't, but--

03:00:51.577 --> 03:00:53.287
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:00:56.873 --> 03:00:58.485
TALIESIN: Seven.

03:00:58.485 --> 03:01:03.266
MATT: He goes like, "No, I don't think it's that.
It was sudden and it was intense, and then it was

03:01:03.266 --> 03:01:06.612
"gone! It's fucking crazy."

03:01:06.612 --> 03:01:09.648
TALIESIN: I'm going to be worried-- I'm going to
check to make sure I've got all this, just in

03:01:09.648 --> 03:01:13.945
case, because that sounds awfully familiar. Do you
need a drink?

03:01:13.945 --> 03:01:15.302
MATT: "Yeah."

03:01:15.302 --> 03:01:18.233
TALIESIN: Come on. We're going to bring you back,
it's okay.

03:01:18.233 --> 03:01:21.942
MATT: (groans) He stands up and like he's leaning
on you for support, but once he gets to his foot,

03:01:21.942 --> 03:01:26.742
it's fine and he's like, "Oh, man!"

03:01:26.742 --> 03:01:28.464
TALIESIN: Poor guy. Come on.

03:01:28.464 --> 03:01:30.026
MATT: All right. You lead him over.

03:01:30.026 --> 03:01:36.616
TALIESIN: I'm bringing back-- I'm going to just
sort of-- yeah. Bring him back, and then tell everybody.

03:01:36.616 --> 03:01:39.985
MATT: Some of the port guard are like going
through the ship now, and they're going through--

03:01:39.985 --> 03:01:46.364
TALIESIN: I'm definitely going to tell everyone my
fruit theory, because I'm down a fruit.

03:01:46.364 --> 03:01:51.044
TRAVIS: Well, shall we, you know, turn in for the
night? Seems like it's been a crazy one.

03:01:51.044 --> 03:01:52.707
SAM: Sure has.

03:01:52.707 --> 03:01:54.194
TALIESIN: I'm tired.

03:01:54.194 --> 03:01:55.719
LIAM: Charlie Adler concurs.

03:01:55.719 --> 03:01:57.933
(laughter)

03:01:57.933 --> 03:01:59.108
TALIESIN: He's very stern for Charlie Adler.

03:01:59.108 --> 03:02:00.943
LIAM: No, it's Caleb.

03:02:00.943 --> 03:02:04.298
TRAVIS: We'll all pile into one room before we
separate for the night.

03:02:04.298 --> 03:02:10.278
MATT: Okay. You all gather into one of the
chambers.

03:02:10.278 --> 03:02:14.417
MARISHA: We kind of stagger a bit, though.

03:02:14.417 --> 03:02:19.171
LAURA: Should we look around the room and make
sure nobody can spy on us? Look for peepholes in

03:02:19.171 --> 03:02:20.774
the room.

03:02:20.774 --> 03:02:23.608
MARISHA: Look for invisible peoples in the room.

03:02:23.608 --> 03:02:25.535
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:02:25.535 --> 03:02:26.884
SAM: I'll do the same.

03:02:26.884 --> 03:02:29.366
TRAVIS: Or how about--

03:02:30.116 --> 03:02:36.246
MARISHA: Fucking fuck! Seven.

03:02:36.306 --> 03:02:38.098
MATT: Lucky seven!

03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:41.629
TALIESIN: Don't you have a spell you can cast that
solves this problem?

03:02:41.629 --> 03:02:43.181
MATT: The room seems fairly secure.

03:02:43.181 --> 03:02:45.619
LIAM: That what? Detects a problem?

03:02:45.619 --> 03:02:47.445
LAURA: That keeps sound in.

03:02:47.445 --> 03:02:49.102
TRAVIS: What'd you find?

03:02:49.102 --> 03:02:50.751
SAM: Good stuff.

03:02:50.751 --> 03:02:52.339
TRAVIS: Oh. Okay.

03:02:52.339 --> 03:02:54.411
SAM: We got a book. Well, I don't have it.

03:02:54.411 --> 03:02:57.462
LAURA: We got a book. Nott found it.

03:02:57.462 --> 03:03:00.325
SAM: Can any of you read this?

03:03:00.325 --> 03:03:01.362
TRAVIS: Well, first--

03:03:01.362 --> 03:03:02.980
MARISHA: I look over his shoulder.

03:03:02.980 --> 03:03:09.400
MATT: Okay. It has some sketches in it. The
language appears to be some sort of either a

03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:14.223
cipher or a personal shorthand. What languages do
you know?

03:03:14.659 --> 03:03:22.144
LIAM: Wherever they are. Celestial, Common,
Sylvan. With my experience tinkering with

03:03:22.144 --> 03:03:26.178
Comprehend Languages, would I believe this is
something I could--?

03:03:26.178 --> 03:03:27.569
MATT: Probably, yeah.

03:03:27.569 --> 03:03:29.224
LIAM: Yeah. All right. I begin casting the ritual
spell.

03:03:29.224 --> 03:03:31.462
MARISHA: I know Deep Speech.

03:03:31.462 --> 03:03:36.437
TRAVIS: Was it hidden, where you found it? Should
we detect to see if it has magic anyway, like a

03:03:36.437 --> 03:03:37.607
trace on it?

03:03:37.607 --> 03:03:41.252
SAM: It was hidden behind a panel, like a false
panel in the wall.

03:03:41.252 --> 03:03:42.106
LAURA: Yeah.

03:03:42.106 --> 03:03:44.865
TALIESIN: If you just bring everything out really
quickly, I'll cast Detect Magic on there.

03:03:44.865 --> 03:03:45.919
SAM: Oh, nice!

03:03:45.919 --> 03:03:48.780
TRAVIS: Yeah, just empty your pockets. Let's just
make sure nobody's following this stuff.

03:03:48.780 --> 03:03:51.902
LIAM: It'll take me 11 minutes to be able to read
this if I can.

03:03:51.902 --> 03:03:53.528
TALIESIN: I'll cast Detect Magic in the meantime.

03:03:53.528 --> 03:03:54.908
SAM: There's these jewels, too.

03:03:54.908 --> 03:04:02.496
LAURA: When we were looking for letters and words
and stuff, we ended up breaking her desk and we

03:04:02.496 --> 03:04:04.331
stole a bunch of jewels--

03:04:04.331 --> 03:04:06.776
TRAVIS: That's not as lo-fi as we were
discussing.

03:04:06.776 --> 03:04:12.120
LAURA: Well, and then the room filled with poison
and then we put a hole in the floor and we fell.

03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:14.066
MARISHA: Oh.

03:04:14.066 --> 03:04:19.631
SAM: Then we caused another guard to stab someone,
and another guard to jump to his death.

03:04:19.631 --> 03:04:20.967
TRAVIS: We saw them.

03:04:20.967 --> 03:04:21.985
TALIESIN: Nah, he's fine.

03:04:21.985 --> 03:04:23.729
LAURA: Then we jumped in the water and we got
away.

03:04:23.729 --> 03:04:25.996
MARISHA: That's pretty awesome.

03:04:25.996 --> 03:04:31.382
LAURA: The thing is, though, Avantika's going to
definitely know that somebody stole her stuff.

03:04:31.382 --> 03:04:42.079
SAM: But we can turn this problem into a
"proble-tunity", and we can take these jewels that

03:04:42.079 --> 03:04:49.863
she will definitely know came from her, and plant
them on someone else to just sort of-- we could

03:04:49.863 --> 03:04:52.931
plant them on this Allison person who she doesn't
like already!

03:04:52.931 --> 03:04:54.103
MARISHA: She is a bitch.

03:04:54.103 --> 03:04:58.186
SAM: Or maybe on one of her own crew, and have
them killed.

03:04:58.186 --> 03:05:03.378
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, isn't Allison not cool with
Avantika, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend,

03:05:03.378 --> 03:05:06.181
right? So why would we want to get Allison in
trouble?

03:05:06.181 --> 03:05:07.460
SAM: Oh.

03:05:07.460 --> 03:05:09.312
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:05:09.312 --> 03:05:12.012
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

03:05:12.012 --> 03:05:15.740
SAM: We could plant them on someone that we don't
like?

03:05:15.740 --> 03:05:16.911
TRAVIS: Sure. Yeah.

03:05:16.911 --> 03:05:21.373
LAURA and TRAVIS: But who?

03:05:21.373 --> 03:05:25.189
SAM: How about Jamedi Cosko? I don't like that
guy.

03:05:25.189 --> 03:05:27.968
LAURA: I like Jamedi; I thought he was nice.

03:05:27.968 --> 03:05:31.359
TRAVIS: Maybe we just hold onto them for now. They
came in containers, right?

03:05:31.359 --> 03:05:32.961
LAURA: Well, yeah, but--

03:05:32.961 --> 03:05:34.103
SAM: We don't want to hold on--

03:05:34.103 --> 03:05:37.377
LAURA: If we hold on and Avantika's like "Let's
everybody empty their pockets" and we have them!

03:05:37.377 --> 03:05:39.534
SAM: Yeah, these are hot rocks here.

03:05:39.534 --> 03:05:42.726
TRAVIS: Are they just gems, or are they specific
pieces of jewelry?

03:05:42.726 --> 03:05:48.232
TALIESIN: We're literally looking at them right
now, and I Detected Magic before we opened the boxes.

03:05:48.232 --> 03:05:56.472
MATT: Okay. You open the boxes. They're a series
of gems, some rougher and probably been scrounged

03:05:56.472 --> 03:06:05.119
up and found that are with some scrapes, imperfect
but still valuable. Maybe three of them that are

03:06:05.119 --> 03:06:17.235
still well cut and have not been given any
abrasions. There is a dull green jade necklace

03:06:17.235 --> 03:06:21.301
that does emit a minor magical essence to it.

03:06:21.301 --> 03:06:26.355
TALIESIN: That one's got a little bit of tingle to
it. I'd be worried about that one. Why don't you

03:06:26.355 --> 03:06:28.190
take a look at that really quickly?

03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:31.571
LIAM: Caleb is not listening to anyone. He is
sprinkling pinches of salt and soot in a circle

03:06:31.571 --> 03:06:34.064
around the book.

03:06:34.064 --> 03:06:36.094
TALIESIN: That book's not worth its circle of
salt.

03:06:36.094 --> 03:06:38.483
SAM: We could destroy these gems and smash them up
into smaller gems.

03:06:38.483 --> 03:06:41.471
TRAVIS: If you're going to plant them on anybody,
Vera would be a good candidate.

03:06:41.471 --> 03:06:43.263
SAM: Vera? Why do you think Vera?

03:06:43.263 --> 03:06:47.428
TRAVIS: Well, because she's a bitch. We got to get
her out of here. She's, you know, wants my job.

03:06:47.428 --> 03:06:51.713
SAM: Isn't that just because you stole her job?
That seems like a legitimate beef.

03:06:51.713 --> 03:06:54.125
LAURA: I think she's in love with Avantika, too.

03:06:54.125 --> 03:06:56.802
SAM: How do you know that?

03:06:56.802 --> 03:07:00.484
LAURA: Because she pulled me aside and she was
like, "I don't like Fjord and I'll kill him if you

03:07:00.484 --> 03:07:01.726
"want me to."

03:07:01.726 --> 03:07:03.514
SAM: She said she's going to kill him?!

03:07:03.514 --> 03:07:07.055
TALIESIN: Perception check. Insight check.

03:07:07.055 --> 03:07:11.302
MATT: Make an insight check. Make a deception
check.

03:07:12.712 --> 03:07:15.234
TALIESIN: I'm pretty low, so what do you got?

03:07:15.234 --> 03:07:15.867
LAURA: Eight.

03:07:15.867 --> 03:07:17.134
TALIESIN: 13.

03:07:17.134 --> 03:07:18.547
MATT: You can tell that she's lying.

03:07:18.547 --> 03:07:24.212
LAURA: Okay, so maybe she didn't say that. But I
still don't think she likes Fjord very much.

03:07:24.212 --> 03:07:27.367
SAM: Well then we should roast her.

03:07:27.367 --> 03:07:30.459
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're definitely going to plant it
on her. Cause some commotion at the top. Caleb,

03:07:30.459 --> 03:07:31.930
what do you got?

03:07:31.930 --> 03:07:34.229
LIAM: (mutters)

03:07:34.229 --> 03:07:35.347
TRAVIS: Oh, it hasn't been time.

03:07:35.347 --> 03:07:36.611
MATT: We'll say by now, you've completed it.

03:07:36.611 --> 03:07:37.719
LIAM: Well, it's up to you!

03:07:37.719 --> 03:07:39.738
MATT: I know. So you can respond.

03:07:39.738 --> 03:07:44.746
LIAM: (poof) All the soot and salt ignites, and
then suddenly, whoa! What's it say?

03:07:44.746 --> 03:07:48.802
MATT: As you go through it, it's hard to follow
since it's shorthand, like it's broken sentences

03:07:48.802 --> 03:07:51.741
and it's pieces. They look to be notes from
dreams.

03:07:51.741 --> 03:07:53.718
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

03:07:53.718 --> 03:07:55.422
SAM: That could be good stuff.

03:07:55.422 --> 03:07:57.294
MARISHA: (gasp) Yes, yes it could!

03:07:57.294 --> 03:07:58.550
TRAVIS: Ooh!

03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:59.696
MARISHA: It's got the apricot tree!

03:07:59.696 --> 03:08:01.981
TRAVIS: Please be an almanac! Sorry.

03:08:01.981 --> 03:08:11.984
MATT: It goes through discussions of mentions of
Vandren. Mentions of being given the mark. The

03:08:11.984 --> 03:08:22.574
eye, on her person. After a ritual that was shown
to her by Vandren, the dreams began. The dreams

03:08:22.574 --> 03:08:32.826
involved this great eye coming to her, with
phrases written down: Provoke. Consume. Learn.

03:08:32.826 --> 03:08:43.653
Reward. It begins to discuss images that involve
having to fight through dark waters, having to

03:08:43.653 --> 03:08:54.167
follow signs, being promised power with gifts and
actions that show leadership and drive towards

03:08:54.167 --> 03:09:05.655
this entity. It spoke about Vandren guiding her,
and then spoke about him getting cold feet. Spoke

03:09:05.655 --> 03:09:20.343
on him mistrusting the dreams, and his weakness.
It spoke on an attempt to then gift Vandren as a

03:09:20.343 --> 03:09:25.568
sacrifice, but he got away.

03:09:26.154 --> 03:09:33.082
LIAM: So Caleb would, seeing this play out as he
reads, would explain it all very carefully, and

03:09:33.082 --> 03:09:42.104
delicately, because he knows how conflicted a
subject, how charged a subject it would be for

03:09:42.104 --> 03:09:46.620
Fjord. But does tell everyone in the room
everything.

03:09:46.620 --> 03:09:56.790
MATT: Then discusses the search for Vandren. For
months and months, to no avail. Eventually

03:09:56.790 --> 03:10:09.802
changing focus, to instead continue to improve the
joyous boons, and earn the yellow light of the

03:10:09.802 --> 03:10:18.204
eye. More dreams, with patterns of figures in her
way. People that were close to her, that she felt

03:10:18.204 --> 03:10:26.012
were barricades, chains that held her back, and
getting rid of them. You're not entirely certain

03:10:26.012 --> 03:10:33.130
what "getting rid of them" means, but at least out
of the path. Finding others that begin to also

03:10:33.130 --> 03:10:43.427
learn of the joys and the promise of ruling the
sea and how, no matter how much Darktow is the

03:10:43.427 --> 03:10:51.633
center of the Revelry, and the power of the Plank
King, who can possibly not choose to bend the knee

03:10:51.633 --> 03:11:00.527
to those who control the oceans they sail on. It
then goes on to talk about other notes and

03:11:00.527 --> 03:11:08.371
scavenged bits, talking about the finding of
Urukaxl. Of the difficulties in hiring people that

03:11:08.371 --> 03:11:18.995
would go there. The hiring of Jamedi to search out
finally, over time. You find some other notes

03:11:18.995 --> 03:11:23.972
about another location, from another dream she
had, that involves three land masses of different

03:11:23.972 --> 03:11:36.173
shapes. There's a few notes and questions around
it, but one of them is saying, "Archipelago?"

03:11:36.173 --> 03:11:40.077
Seems to mark these as a possible--

03:11:40.077 --> 03:11:42.253
SAM: There's three land masses, right there!

03:11:42.253 --> 03:11:43.420
MARISHA: Nah.

03:11:43.420 --> 03:11:45.187
LIAM: She's cooked.

03:11:45.187 --> 03:11:55.884
MATT: Then it goes into a few brief phrases about
the newcomers. Discussing how the Mist was taken.

03:11:55.884 --> 03:11:58.309
It's not a lot written in this page.

03:11:58.309 --> 03:12:01.694
SAM: Which one's her favorite?

03:12:01.694 --> 03:12:09.093
MATT: All it says is, "I've found another chosen.
Perhaps this one will be more useful than Vandren."

03:12:09.093 --> 03:12:11.523
SAM: And I fucked him.

03:12:11.523 --> 03:12:16.543
MATT: It does not say that. That's where the notes
finish.

03:12:16.543 --> 03:12:25.820
LIAM: Minor detail: in Caleb's deciphering of all
the fragments, was there any sense that there was

03:12:25.820 --> 03:12:32.433
any kind of romantic relationship between Avantika
and Vandren? Or it's unclear?

03:12:32.433 --> 03:12:33.984
MATT: It is very unclear.

03:12:33.984 --> 03:12:35.651
LIAM: Okay.

03:12:35.651 --> 03:12:37.739
TRAVIS: What language was that in?

03:12:37.739 --> 03:12:39.442
TALIESIN: What was the necklace, while we're
here?

03:12:39.442 --> 03:12:40.427
MATT: It's a personal cipher.

03:12:40.427 --> 03:12:41.542
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:12:41.542 --> 03:12:44.069
LIAM: Yeah, her own cipher.

03:12:44.069 --> 03:12:45.407
TRAVIS: That's not great for us.

03:12:45.407 --> 03:12:46.727
LIAM: That's not helpful at all.

03:12:46.727 --> 03:12:51.556
TALIESIN: Well. Really, what's the necklace before
we go any further to make sure it's not a

03:12:51.556 --> 03:12:53.164
come-find-my-shit?

03:12:53.164 --> 03:12:53.975
LIAM: Which necklace would that be?

03:12:53.975 --> 03:12:55.232
LAURA: The jade necklace

03:12:55.232 --> 03:12:58.689
LIAM: First time I'm seeing it, not really but,
just give me ten minutes.

03:12:58.689 --> 03:13:05.246
TALIESIN: Is there any part in the book that is
actually a cipher for its own. Okay.

03:13:05.246 --> 03:13:10.444
MATT: Glancing through, it looks like you either
learn it here or whatever it would be used to try

03:13:10.520 --> 03:13:13.945
to decode it is not present in the book.

03:13:16.213 --> 03:13:23.185
SAM: I don't want to say that we're the best
detectives because that's already--

03:13:23.185 --> 03:13:24.080
LAURA: A given.

03:13:24.080 --> 03:13:29.858
SAM: -- established fact. But could this be that
we just got promoted?

03:13:29.858 --> 03:13:31.412
LAURA: To what?

03:13:31.412 --> 03:13:37.879
SAM: Commissioner. I don't know. Could be. We just
cracked the case again.

03:13:37.879 --> 03:13:42.877
LAURA: Cracked the case. Fjord, are you as crazy
as she is? Because holy shit.

03:13:42.877 --> 03:13:51.423
LIAM: Here's the question. Could brainiac Caleb
with this book, which is her own coded cipher,

03:13:51.423 --> 03:13:57.946
Comprehend Languages with enough time try to study
the recurrence of vowel sounds, consonance sounds,

03:13:57.946 --> 03:14:03.831
and try to create a key to this book?

03:14:03.831 --> 03:14:08.432
MATT: You get the sense that this written cipher
is not a verbal language. It is specifically

03:14:08.432 --> 03:14:10.813
written for her own notes and own purpose.

03:14:10.813 --> 03:14:11.696
LIAM: Yeah?

03:14:11.696 --> 03:14:15.765
MATT: So you couldn't speak it, but if you want to
go ahead and decode it?

03:14:15.765 --> 03:14:17.885
LIAM: But people break codes--

03:14:17.885 --> 03:14:23.394
MATT: Yeah, I'm saying you couldn't. It wouldn't
be able to--Sorry, I misunderstood. You couldn't

03:14:23.394 --> 03:14:28.273
speak it. Go ahead and make an intelligence
check.

03:14:28.273 --> 03:14:30.604
TALIESIN: It would be amazing if you pulled this
off.

03:14:30.604 --> 03:14:32.442
LIAM: I've rolled shit all night. Every roll.

03:14:32.442 --> 03:14:34.099
TRAVIS: You're due one.

03:14:34.099 --> 03:14:35.556
TALIESIN: But not this one.

03:14:35.556 --> 03:14:36.630
LIAM: Natural 20!

03:14:36.630 --> 03:14:41.208
(cheering)

03:14:41.208 --> 03:14:44.721
MATT: Fuck, dude! Fuck!

03:14:44.721 --> 03:14:50.588
TRAVIS: Rise, baby, rise!

03:14:51.197 --> 03:14:53.611
MATT: What does that put you at a total?

03:14:53.611 --> 03:14:58.535
LIAM: Oh, pretty good. Straight intelligence,
right?

03:14:58.535 --> 03:14:59.866
MATT: Correct.

03:14:59.866 --> 03:15:01.551
LIAM: 28.

03:15:01.551 --> 03:15:04.014
MATT: Intelligence modifier is eight?

03:15:04.014 --> 03:15:06.743
LIAM: Yeah, it bumped up to 20 when I leveled up.

03:15:06.743 --> 03:15:08.647
MATT: It would be plus five then.

03:15:08.647 --> 03:15:09.993
LAURA: Not your saving throw.

03:15:09.993 --> 03:15:13.240
LIAM: Saving throw, sorry I was looking at the
wrong place. That's correct. 25.

03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:19.443
MATT: That is exactly the DC you would have needed
to do this. It is set at a very hard DC. You only

03:15:19.443 --> 03:15:21.677
could have done this with a 20, you motherfucker.

03:15:21.677 --> 03:15:23.359
LAURA: You have maxed out intelligence.

03:15:23.359 --> 03:15:27.752
MATT: Goddamn it, okay! All right! No, here we go!
It'll take you the better part of the night. You

03:15:27.752 --> 03:15:30.399
probably won't sleep which means you won't get
your spells back.

03:15:30.399 --> 03:15:31.968
TALIESIN: Take a second to identify the necklace
so we don't get--

03:15:31.968 --> 03:15:34.607
SAM: Don't bother him!

03:15:34.607 --> 03:15:36.111
TRAVIS: What if the necklace as a trace on it?

03:15:36.111 --> 03:15:36.921
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:15:36.921 --> 03:15:39.470
MATT: It'll take you the night to complete it. You
will not be able to sleep, which means you won't

03:15:39.470 --> 03:15:42.063
get your spells back and you'll suffer a point of
exhaustion.

03:15:42.063 --> 03:15:48.773
LIAM: That's fine. I would like to-- Because I was
asking you a question and then suddenly it was

03:15:48.773 --> 03:15:50.118
happening, right?

03:15:50.118 --> 03:15:51.682
MATT: I'm just letting you what would take. You
know you can do this.

03:15:51.682 --> 03:15:56.238
LIAM: Let's say Caduceus gives Caleb the necklace.
He'll take ten minutes to figure out what this

03:15:56.238 --> 03:16:00.064
jade necklace is and spend the night decoding this
book.

03:16:00.064 --> 03:16:01.380
SAM: Wow.

03:16:01.380 --> 03:16:04.167
MARISHA: Holy shit.

03:16:04.167 --> 03:16:06.293
SAM: Best plan ever.

03:16:06.293 --> 03:16:10.503
TRAVIS: O for six in the series and you crank one
at the bottom of the ninth.

03:16:10.503 --> 03:16:12.333
MARISHA: You got a book!

03:16:12.333 --> 03:16:13.718
LIAM: It's not a book.

03:16:13.718 --> 03:16:14.737
LAURA: That's a necklace.

03:16:14.737 --> 03:16:15.703
LIAM: It's a necklace.

03:16:15.703 --> 03:16:16.756
TRAVIS: Oh wow!

03:16:16.756 --> 03:16:18.128
MARISHA: But you still get a book!

03:16:18.128 --> 03:16:19.395
MATT: Immediate excitement and disappointment.

03:16:19.395 --> 03:16:21.459
MARISHA: You still get a book, though! That's what
I was saying!

03:16:21.459 --> 03:16:27.196
TALIESIN: Here's the thing: are we going to remove
the mention of you from the book?

03:16:27.196 --> 03:16:30.253
LAURA: It doesn't say the name.

03:16:30.253 --> 03:16:32.626
LIAM: Just says, "found someone special."

03:16:32.626 --> 03:16:35.758
TALIESIN: There's no way of inferring within the
book--

03:16:35.758 --> 03:16:37.564
MATT: It doesn't have the name Fjord.

03:16:37.564 --> 03:16:40.570
TALIESIN: But it doesn't connect the newcomers to
the new chosen.

03:16:40.570 --> 03:16:42.361
MATT: Hmm?

03:16:42.361 --> 03:16:45.340
TALIESIN: One could not infer that the new chosen
was part of the newcomers from the way she wrote

03:16:45.340 --> 03:16:48.143
it or no? Is it separated thoughts?

03:16:48.143 --> 03:16:49.663
MATT: Not necessarily.

03:16:49.663 --> 03:16:58.649
TALIESIN: All right. Worst-case scenario is we
could mend a page and it will remove the ink if we

03:16:58.649 --> 03:17:00.498
want to delete anything.

03:17:00.498 --> 03:17:10.515
LIAM: This is like that around your neck except
it's specific to warding off poison. No poison.

03:17:10.515 --> 03:17:18.340
TALIESIN: It's very helpful. That might be
either--

03:17:18.340 --> 03:17:23.714
LIAM: It could help any one of us, really. Would
you like it, Nott?

03:17:23.714 --> 03:17:28.707
SAM: It's pretty! Oh, but wait. It's a hot rock.

03:17:28.707 --> 03:17:31.776
TRAVIS: We're not keeping anything on our persons.
We need to hide it, bury it.

03:17:31.776 --> 03:17:35.279
TALIESIN: In the best case scenario, I would say
if we could hide this is someone else's room

03:17:35.279 --> 03:17:36.466
underneath their bed.

03:17:36.466 --> 03:17:38.898
SAM: We could put it in the bag of holding or
whatever.

03:17:38.898 --> 03:17:40.732
TALIESIN: I would love for these to be in somebody
else's room.

03:17:40.732 --> 03:17:43.527
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. You dump that bag out or just go
searching for a necklace, stick your hand it, it

03:17:43.527 --> 03:17:45.136
comes right out.

03:17:45.136 --> 03:17:46.692
LAURA: It'll come right out.

03:17:46.692 --> 03:17:50.673
LIAM: I say we tie it to a rock and drop the rock
off a specific dock, and maybe we're lucky and

03:17:50.673 --> 03:17:51.954
it's still there later.

03:17:51.954 --> 03:17:55.641
TRAVIS: Or we could old-school bury it under a
tree, right? Mark it? Same diff.

03:17:55.641 --> 03:17:57.814
TALIESIN: It's still going to be findable to
anybody who's looking for it, though. I would

03:17:57.814 --> 03:18:03.082
really recommend putting it, I don't know,
somewhere where we don't mind it being very

03:18:03.082 --> 03:18:06.638
specifically found, especially if we're trying
to--

03:18:06.638 --> 03:18:08.097
TRAVIS: Frame somebody?

03:18:08.097 --> 03:18:12.935
TALIESIN: Well, I hate to put it that way, but uh,
I don't know. This seems--

03:18:12.935 --> 03:18:18.789
TRAVIS: Well, listen. I am all for putting Vera in
a bad light, right? Avantika is going to want to

03:18:18.789 --> 03:18:26.770
know who did this. Yeah, Tiff. Old Tiff Fanny.
Might as well put it on her, right?

03:18:26.770 --> 03:18:29.792
SAM: Do we know where she's staying, which room
she's in?

03:18:29.792 --> 03:18:31.363
TRAVIS: No.

03:18:31.363 --> 03:18:35.024
LIAM: We have to be able to have someone point the
finger at her, though, because what happens if she

03:18:35.024 --> 03:18:37.748
finds it herself, later?

03:18:37.748 --> 03:18:39.815
TALIESIN: That doesn't matter. It's still in her
room.

03:18:39.815 --> 03:18:42.598
LIAM: But if she finds it, she could throw it out.
She could sell it. She could say, I found this in

03:18:42.598 --> 03:18:45.922
my room. I mean, that's unpredictable. I mean, we
can't control that.

03:18:45.922 --> 03:18:51.836
TRAVIS: No, but, maybe we're thinking too
small-ball. If you can actually make a translation

03:18:51.836 --> 03:18:56.602
of that thing, that's the frame we've been looking
for. We take that to the Plank King, we're going

03:18:56.602 --> 03:19:02.413
to get all the head start we can get. We know
where the other peach tree is now, so--

03:19:02.413 --> 03:19:03.864
MARISHA: Mmm-hmm.

03:19:03.864 --> 03:19:04.677
LAURA: Apricots, Fjord.

03:19:04.677 --> 03:19:07.803
TRAVIS: It's apples and peaches, so you know.

03:19:07.803 --> 03:19:11.152
MARISHA: Between apples and peaches.

03:19:11.152 --> 03:19:18.739
TALIESIN: We have to make sure that you survive
long enough to get it there. I mean, I wish you'd

03:19:18.739 --> 03:19:21.934
just grabbed the book. That would make life more
easy.

03:19:21.934 --> 03:19:26.077
LAURA: If-- I know, we shouldn't have grabbed
everything.

03:19:26.077 --> 03:19:30.994
SAM: What, the jewels? We can just throw them in
the ocean.

03:19:30.994 --> 03:19:32.596
LAURA: We could just throw them in the ocean.

03:19:32.596 --> 03:19:33.558
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:19:33.558 --> 03:19:41.584
SAM: We could snoop-- We could wait until we see
Vera at breakfast tomorrow and just-- Right? She's

03:19:41.584 --> 03:19:42.877
staying here.

03:19:42.877 --> 03:19:45.997
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think it's too dangerous to try
and plant it on her. It's adding one step that we

03:19:45.997 --> 03:19:47.326
don't need.

03:19:47.326 --> 03:19:48.710
MARISHA: I agree with that.

03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:51.830
TRAVIS: I think we take it, once you're
finished--

03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:57.453
LIAM: This is the key. Anything else is a
distraction, can only cause wrinkles, so we ditch

03:19:57.453 --> 03:20:04.161
it. Maybe somewhere where it can be found again,
but it is not as important as this book is. So, we

03:20:04.161 --> 03:20:06.475
solve this, and her goose is cooked.

03:20:06.475 --> 03:20:07.408
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:20:07.408 --> 03:20:08.378
TRAVIS: Yeah. I agree.

03:20:08.378 --> 03:20:12.119
SAM: Except if we bring this to the Plank King,
it's admitting that we broke into the ship and

03:20:12.119 --> 03:20:13.080
stole it.

03:20:13.080 --> 03:20:16.842
MARISHA: We don't need to take that to the Plank
King if Caleb knows the language.

03:20:16.842 --> 03:20:18.079
TALIESIN: Yeah, we do.

03:20:18.079 --> 03:20:19.071
LIAM: We do, though.

03:20:19.071 --> 03:20:20.136
SAM: We do.

03:20:20.136 --> 03:20:26.536
MARISHA: Why? She could ford anything that we
want-- Forge. She could forge--

03:20:26.536 --> 03:20:28.384
TALIESIN: We still need to prove the book.

03:20:28.384 --> 03:20:30.872
SAM: We still need proof that this came from her,
that she wrote this.

03:20:30.872 --> 03:20:33.438
MARISHA: We have her signature, let's forge it.

03:20:33.438 --> 03:20:34.836
SAM: But that's fake.

03:20:34.836 --> 03:20:39.250
TALIESIN: That's too much. I feel like we can take
the book to him. I think if we say that we knew

03:20:39.250 --> 03:20:41.763
about the plot, we suspected, and were looking for
proof--

03:20:41.763 --> 03:20:44.249
SAM: Yeah. That's good, I like that.

03:20:44.249 --> 03:20:47.378
LIAM: I have a question for the group, because I
don't remember. Did Beauregard share with the

03:20:47.378 --> 03:20:51.976
group that she got tapped by the Plank King?

03:20:51.976 --> 03:20:53.891
SAM: She would've shared that, right?

03:20:53.891 --> 03:20:55.967
MARISHA: I probably would have. Yeah.

03:20:55.967 --> 03:20:58.375
MATT: Well, now would be the time to share it if
you hadn't.

03:20:58.375 --> 03:21:02.854
MARISHA: So by the way, I got tapped on the
shoulder by the Plank King. He's looking for dirt

03:21:02.854 --> 03:21:03.969
on Avantika.

03:21:03.969 --> 03:21:04.956
SAM: What!?

03:21:04.956 --> 03:21:07.617
MARISHA: I know. Totally mind-blowing. I know you
had no clue.

03:21:07.617 --> 03:21:14.312
TRAVIS: I don't think it does, right? As Beau has
appropriately stated many times, snitches get

03:21:14.312 --> 03:21:19.640
stitches. If we walk that in there, the Plank King
might just be looking for disloyal motherfuckers

03:21:19.640 --> 03:21:26.811
to hang up by their toes. We need to find a way to
either message that, to send via messenger with

03:21:26.811 --> 03:21:32.783
the book and a codex that you've created, and let
him be able to see the evidence for himself.

03:21:32.862 --> 03:21:38.921
SAM: We could drop it in Allison's mailbox and
say, hey, here's all the proof you need to destroy Avantika.

03:21:38.921 --> 03:21:41.357
MARISHA: I don't think we need to do that. I think
we just drop it in the Plank King's--

03:21:41.357 --> 03:21:43.173
TRAVIS: We're assuming that she wants to destroy
her.

03:21:43.173 --> 03:21:44.612
SAM: Well, did you see the way they looked at each
other?

03:21:44.612 --> 03:21:47.723
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe they need to (yowl) get it on,
you know?

03:21:47.723 --> 03:21:57.587
LIAM: Maybe we send Frumpkin with this stuff in
tow, to his little perch with a note. An anonymous note.

03:21:57.587 --> 03:21:59.521
LAURA: Yeah. I like it.

03:21:59.521 --> 03:22:01.668
MARISHA: I think we copy the contents of the
book.

03:22:01.668 --> 03:22:03.849
TALIESIN: We have a copy of the contents of the
book.

03:22:03.849 --> 03:22:05.393
LAURA: Caleb's brain.

03:22:05.393 --> 03:22:06.850
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying, we copy the
contents of the book.

03:22:06.850 --> 03:22:08.727
TRAVIS: A physical copy or up in the dome?

03:22:08.727 --> 03:22:12.847
LIAM: I have a copy. In my noodle.

03:22:12.847 --> 03:22:16.529
MARISHA: Sure, as long as you think it'll last
there.

03:22:16.529 --> 03:22:20.159
LIAM: Ja, I can write it down.

03:22:20.159 --> 03:22:25.425
MARISHA: I will say, the Plank King offered me
some good cash to rat out Avantika.

03:22:25.425 --> 03:22:28.962
SAM: Yeah, he was asking for a snitch.

03:22:28.962 --> 03:22:31.335
MARISHA: He was literally asking for a snitch.
Now--

03:22:31.335 --> 03:22:31.984
TRAVIS: True.

03:22:31.984 --> 03:22:37.809
SAM: That seems legit. That seems legit and
honest. He was making an honest-- Right? Did you

03:22:37.809 --> 03:22:40.671
get the honest vibe from Plankie?

03:22:40.671 --> 03:22:45.407
MARISHA: No. Nothing about any of these people is
honest.

03:22:45.407 --> 03:22:49.349
TALIESIN: I think he'd kill both of them. I think
sending it with-- Just sending it to him and just

03:22:49.349 --> 03:22:50.688
giving it to him--

03:22:50.688 --> 03:22:54.475
LIAM: Well, it could be an anonymous note. Or we
could send Frumpkin once we leave here, and you

03:22:54.475 --> 03:22:56.606
could sign it, from Beauregard.

03:22:56.606 --> 03:22:59.344
TALIESIN: I would almost say, if we could give him
the whole kit and kaboodle, everything that was

03:22:59.344 --> 03:23:03.366
stolen, top to bottom, with a note saying this is
the full--

03:23:03.366 --> 03:23:04.687
MARISHA: I know what to sign.

03:23:04.687 --> 03:23:05.936
LIAM: Spill it, girl. Spill it.

03:23:05.936 --> 03:23:08.131
MARISHA: Just write it up, and I'll sign it.

03:23:08.131 --> 03:23:12.722
SAM: Ooh, who knows what it'll be.

03:23:12.722 --> 03:23:16.469
TRAVIS: What?

03:23:16.469 --> 03:23:20.040
SAM: She's keeping us in suspense.

03:23:20.040 --> 03:23:24.739
MARISHA: I'll simply sign it with: How much?

03:23:24.739 --> 03:23:28.570
TRAVIS: To go with the package?

03:23:28.570 --> 03:23:30.278
MARISHA: To go with the package.

03:23:30.278 --> 03:23:32.280
LIAM: To go with this, once I have deciphered it
for them.

03:23:32.280 --> 03:23:35.741
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Unless we want zero
implications--

03:23:35.741 --> 03:23:38.789
TRAVIS: Yeah, that swings back to us a little
bit.

03:23:38.789 --> 03:23:44.295
TALIESIN: I say translate the one page, give the
cipher so that they can figure it out on their

03:23:44.371 --> 03:23:50.607
own. Let's give the whole thing to him, just all
the jewels, all the box, the whole thing top to bottom.

03:23:50.607 --> 03:23:57.201
LIAM: Avantika's coming for your throat. This is
the evidence, do with it what you will. We go to

03:23:57.201 --> 03:24:00.036
the pomegranate tree.

03:24:00.036 --> 03:24:04.549
TRAVIS: Yes. Yeah. I don't know how we get out of
here, but we're going to try.

03:24:04.549 --> 03:24:06.129
MARISHA: We need the Mist.

03:24:06.129 --> 03:24:07.300
TALIESIN: We'll be fine.

03:24:07.300 --> 03:24:10.042
TRAVIS: Well, we need to wait until they apprehend
her.

03:24:10.042 --> 03:24:11.379
SAM: Then we can take her boat.

03:24:11.379 --> 03:24:12.766
TALIESIN: Then we can take our boat.

03:24:12.766 --> 03:24:14.268
TRAVIS: We do something.

03:24:14.268 --> 03:24:18.177
LIAM: We could also add to this note that Frumpkin
delivers that Avantika-- Here is your proof that

03:24:18.177 --> 03:24:22.544
Avantika wants your throat; the whole crew is
complicit.

03:24:22.544 --> 03:24:25.647
LAURA: We're part of the crew.

03:24:25.999 --> 03:24:32.426
TRAVIS: Oh boy. You know-- Okay. Just throwing it
out there, big picture, okay, because there are

03:24:32.426 --> 03:24:38.151
two goals on that map. One is the peach, the other
is the peach tree. If we go to one and she goes to

03:24:38.151 --> 03:24:42.313
the other, and let's say she gets deferred
adjudication and gets out just a little bit after

03:24:42.313 --> 03:24:47.195
us, she might be waiting for us at one or the
other. I'm just saying.

03:24:47.195 --> 03:24:49.250
SAM: But then we'll face her head on.

03:24:49.250 --> 03:24:53.267
TALIESIN: Let's let them make any insinuations
they want. The crew will fall the way they will.

03:24:53.267 --> 03:24:59.250
Again, I think giving too much is too much. The
guy's itching for a reason to get rid of her.

03:24:59.250 --> 03:25:04.538
Let's give him what he wants. No conditions, no
terms. Nothing.

03:25:04.538 --> 03:25:09.554
TRAVIS: Let's just do that. Let's let Caleb do his
thing, and we'll see what the morning does. Where

03:25:09.554 --> 03:25:11.766
are we keeping the gems and everything else in the
meantime?

03:25:11.766 --> 03:25:13.656
TALIESIN: In the safe, maybe.

03:25:13.656 --> 03:25:16.431
SAM: Just one-- One other consideration.

03:25:16.431 --> 03:25:19.361
TRAVIS: The lead safe? Do we still have that? In
the bag?

03:25:19.361 --> 03:25:22.383
MATT: Well, the safe in the bag you still have,
yeah.

03:25:22.383 --> 03:25:29.635
SAM: One other consideration, just throwing it out
there. We're all spitballing here, right?

03:25:29.635 --> 03:25:32.078
LAURA: Big lead safe, not in the bag.

03:25:32.078 --> 03:25:34.188
MATT: The big one you ordered, yeah, that wouldn't
have gone in there.

03:25:34.188 --> 03:25:36.073
LAURA: But the little box that we have the thing
in, yeah.

03:25:36.073 --> 03:25:37.385
MATT: Yeah.

03:25:37.385 --> 03:25:42.516
SAM: You know that page that you were telling us
about that says, the three land masses might be

03:25:42.516 --> 03:25:54.568
the Grand Archipelago? Maybe, when you're
translating, that becomes four land masses and a

03:25:54.568 --> 03:25:56.005
different place?

03:25:56.005 --> 03:25:58.291
TALIESIN: We're not going to translate the whole
book, just one page.

03:25:58.291 --> 03:25:59.718
TRAVIS: No, if she gets the book back--

03:25:59.718 --> 03:26:02.310
TALIESIN: Well, how is she going to get the book
back?

03:26:02.310 --> 03:26:04.538
TRAVIS: We do have the lead safe. The
Dodecahedron's in it.

03:26:04.538 --> 03:26:06.940
SAM: We're going to translate one page?

03:26:06.940 --> 03:26:10.548
LIAM: No, here's the thing. If we just give them a
page--

03:26:10.548 --> 03:26:14.049
SAM: No, it's got to be the whole book.

03:26:14.049 --> 03:26:20.258
MARISHA: No, no, no. He's saying we send a cipher
and a translated page with the entire book.

03:26:20.332 --> 03:26:22.469
TALIESIN: Does that make sense?

03:26:22.469 --> 03:26:27.241
MARISHA: So that they can then take the time with
their smart people to translate the rest of the book.

03:26:27.241 --> 03:26:28.718
TALIESIN: He's making the cipher.

03:26:28.718 --> 03:26:30.737
MARISHA: No, he knows the cipher.

03:26:30.737 --> 03:26:32.905
LAURA: Oh no, it's getting late. I'm getting
confused.

03:26:32.905 --> 03:26:38.423
LIAM: I am going to make a cipher that can be used
to decode this book. If we send a cipher and the

03:26:38.423 --> 03:26:42.783
book, they can take time to read the entire
thing.

03:26:42.783 --> 03:26:43.730
MARISHA: Correct.

03:26:43.730 --> 03:26:45.744
TALIESIN: Let's rip a few pages out.

03:26:45.744 --> 03:26:46.673
LIAM: Hmm.

03:26:46.673 --> 03:26:52.081
MARISHA: They'll be able to tell, unless we do
Jester's hint, where we Mend a few pages and get

03:26:52.081 --> 03:26:53.537
rid of some ink.

03:26:53.537 --> 03:26:57.163
SAM: I would Mend the page that has the thing
about where the peach tree is.

03:26:57.163 --> 03:27:01.244
MARISHA: So let's just do that, and the rest of
the plan stays the same.

03:27:01.244 --> 03:27:03.062
TRAVIS: Yeah. Make it so.

03:27:03.062 --> 03:27:04.620
LIAM: Ja, that's good.

03:27:04.620 --> 03:27:06.383
MARISHA: Break!

03:27:06.383 --> 03:27:08.093
LIAM: But we'll leave immediately.

03:27:08.093 --> 03:27:09.431
SAM: We are so good at this!

03:27:09.431 --> 03:27:11.747
TRAVIS: Well, once she's apprehended.

03:27:11.747 --> 03:27:12.597
LIAM: Correct.

03:27:12.597 --> 03:27:17.813
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. We'll send some food and water
up your way.

03:27:17.813 --> 03:27:19.183
LIAM: Ja. Goodnight.

03:27:19.183 --> 03:27:21.044
MATT: All right, so who's holding what?

03:27:21.044 --> 03:27:24.695
TRAVIS: The jewels in the containers go in the
lead safe.

03:27:24.695 --> 03:27:26.501
SAM: Where does that go?

03:27:26.501 --> 03:27:27.722
TRAVIS: In the Bag of Holding.

03:27:27.722 --> 03:27:28.610
MATT: Okay.

03:27:28.610 --> 03:27:34.010
LIAM: I take out the silver thread first.

03:27:34.010 --> 03:27:35.413
MATT: All right.

03:27:35.413 --> 03:27:39.630
SAM: Are we all staying in this room tonight?

03:27:39.630 --> 03:27:43.125
TALIESIN: No. I'm going to my room.

03:27:43.125 --> 03:27:47.671
TRAVIS: Is it stupid to be literally down the hall
decoding this journal all night from where

03:27:47.671 --> 03:27:49.720
Avantika's staying?

03:27:49.720 --> 03:27:51.110
LAURA: Too late.

03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:54.424
SAM: Well, we've got the silver thread up. She
can't get in.

03:27:54.424 --> 03:27:56.902
TRAVIS: It's just a warning system, right? It
doesn't keep her out.

03:27:56.902 --> 03:27:58.411
TALIESIN: It'll wake us up, though.

03:27:58.411 --> 03:28:01.167
MARISHA: It'll wake us up. So who's guarding
Caleb?

03:28:01.167 --> 03:28:02.533
SAM and MARISHA: I'll guard Caleb.

03:28:02.533 --> 03:28:04.676
TRAVIS: So will Yasha.

03:28:04.676 --> 03:28:08.429
MATT: All right, so you guys will take sleeping
shifts.

03:28:08.429 --> 03:28:10.550
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:15.940
MATT: Mark yourself with one point of
exhaustion, Caleb. You don't recover spells. The

03:28:15.968 --> 03:28:17.930
rest of you get a full rest.

03:28:17.930 --> 03:28:19.765
LIAM: I only used one.

03:28:19.765 --> 03:28:22.697
SAM and MARISHA: That's good.

03:28:22.697 --> 03:28:25.864
TALIESIN: Oh, new spells.

03:28:27.501 --> 03:28:31.298
SAM: I attack Fjord, sneak attack damage! Pretty
good.

03:28:34.336 --> 03:28:37.045
(knocking)

03:28:37.045 --> 03:28:38.323
MARISHA: What's that? Where is that?

03:28:38.323 --> 03:28:39.749
(knocking continues)

03:28:39.749 --> 03:28:42.795
MATT: To each of your doors, shortly after
sunrise.

03:28:42.795 --> 03:28:45.793
SAM: Oh. What's Caleb up to?

03:28:45.793 --> 03:28:49.277
MATT: He's just finishing making most of the
cipher.

03:28:49.277 --> 03:28:52.076
SAM: Hide that shit, hide that shit! Hide that
shit!

03:28:52.076 --> 03:28:57.588
MATT: All right, so you have to have the book to
make the cipher. So you go ahead and go find

03:28:57.588 --> 03:29:00.491
Jester? Are you guys in the same room?

03:29:00.491 --> 03:29:02.168
LAURA: I was sleeping in the room.

03:29:02.168 --> 03:29:06.591
LIAM: I wasn't working on the book and the cipher
all at once, all through the night?

03:29:06.591 --> 03:29:09.247
MATT: That would've been-- That's the process that
happened.

03:29:09.247 --> 03:29:10.746
LIAM: That's what I'm saying, yeah.

03:29:10.746 --> 03:29:11.990
MATT: You hand it to Jester to go ahead and hide?

03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:13.474
LIAM: Ja. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

03:29:13.474 --> 03:29:26.183
LAURA: Is there anything in the room that seems
like it could be hollow or anything?

03:29:26.183 --> 03:29:31.002
MATT: How so?

03:29:31.002 --> 03:29:37.757
LAURA: I'm looking for somewhere that I can put a
hole in it, hide the jewels in there, and then

03:29:37.757 --> 03:29:44.249
Mend it so that it won't look like anything ever
touched it. But I'll know where they are.

03:29:44.249 --> 03:29:46.922
MATT: Make an investigation check. This would be
perception, I guess.

03:29:46.922 --> 03:29:51.675
TALIESIN: I thought-- Okay, we're-- Okay, new
plan. Sure.

03:29:51.675 --> 03:29:54.402
LAURA: Do I get advantage still, if this was last
night?

03:29:54.402 --> 03:29:55.817
MATT: No, it only lasts for an hour.

03:29:55.817 --> 03:29:58.352
LAURA: Okay. 13.

03:29:58.352 --> 03:30:04.183
MATT: 13. Looking around, no. The room is shoddy
in some ways, but it doesn't have large holes you

03:30:04.183 --> 03:30:05.584
can hide gems in.

03:30:05.584 --> 03:30:07.127
SAM: It's in the haversack. It's okay.

03:30:07.127 --> 03:30:08.684
LAURA: Yeah, but if I get searched--

03:30:08.684 --> 03:30:09.806
TRAVIS: It's in the safe, right?

03:30:09.806 --> 03:30:11.139
TALIESIN: It's in the safe.

03:30:11.139 --> 03:30:12.132
LAURA: Yeah.

03:30:12.132 --> 03:30:13.701
TRAVIS: Lead should block it.

03:30:13.701 --> 03:30:16.823
LAURA: Yeah, and you don't think she's going to
go, "Open this safe?"

03:30:16.823 --> 03:30:19.845
SAM: She can't pull the safe unless she knows it's
in there.

03:30:19.845 --> 03:30:24.160
LAURA: If she turns the bag over and empties it
out, everything comes out.

03:30:24.160 --> 03:30:25.374
TALIESIN: That's not true.

03:30:25.374 --> 03:30:26.306
TRAVIS: Yes it is.

03:30:26.306 --> 03:30:27.392
LAURA: If you turn the bag inside out--

03:30:27.392 --> 03:30:28.549
TALIESIN: Everything comes out?

03:30:28.549 --> 03:30:29.264
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:30:29.264 --> 03:30:37.908
LAURA: Okay. Okay. This was last night. I was
looking for a place to hide.

03:30:37.908 --> 03:30:44.220
MATT: A voice comes to the room and goes, "Hey!
Wake up!"

03:30:44.220 --> 03:30:46.713
TALIESIN: What's going on, man? Hey. Good
morning.

03:30:46.713 --> 03:30:47.835
LAURA: What?

03:30:47.835 --> 03:30:49.808
TRAVIS: Caduceus and I will open the door to our
room.

03:30:49.808 --> 03:30:59.497
MATT: All right. You see Bouldergut out there with
one of the guards and Willow Whisk, who's the

03:30:59.497 --> 03:31:09.929
cook. Jeremiah, who's rubbing his eyes. Bouldergut
goes, "All hands on deck."

03:31:09.929 --> 03:31:11.956
TRAVIS: Now?

03:31:11.956 --> 03:31:14.464
MATT: "Company meeting."

03:31:14.464 --> 03:31:17.682
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure. Let us get our shit together.

03:31:17.682 --> 03:31:18.988
TALIESIN: I'll go get dressed.

03:31:18.988 --> 03:31:20.556
MATT: "Now."

03:31:20.556 --> 03:31:22.299
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:31:22.299 --> 03:31:23.875
TALIESIN: I'll grab my stuff.

03:31:23.875 --> 03:31:25.868
TRAVIS: Grabbing our stuff.

03:31:25.868 --> 03:31:29.645
MATT: Goes to the next door, says the same thing
through the doorway.

03:31:29.645 --> 03:31:32.865
SAM: Hello?

03:31:32.865 --> 03:31:40.627
MATT: "All hands on deck! Company meeting!"

03:31:40.627 --> 03:31:42.145
SAM: On the deck of the ship?

03:31:42.145 --> 03:31:46.084
MATT: "Yeah. Yes."

03:31:46.084 --> 03:31:50.303
SAM: All right. Aye aye. We'll see you there in,
what, a couple hours?

03:31:50.303 --> 03:31:51.767
MATT: Pets you on the head a little bit.

03:31:51.767 --> 03:31:53.035
SAM: That's fine.

03:31:53.035 --> 03:31:58.567
MATT: "Eh heh heh." Goes to every room and says
the same deal.

03:31:58.567 --> 03:32:00.943
MARISHA: Okay, what are we going to do?

03:32:00.943 --> 03:32:04.686
LAURA: What does the hallway look like that all
the rooms are in?

03:32:04.686 --> 03:32:10.618
MATT: It's a long hallway; series of chambers,
most of the doors closed. Looks to be four and

03:32:10.618 --> 03:32:14.268
four, and there's a stairway that leads up to a
third level.

03:32:14.268 --> 03:32:15.908
SAM: Want me to throw it on the roof?

03:32:15.908 --> 03:32:22.346
MARISHA: Can we send Frumpkin now with the
package? Just send him now, out the window.

03:32:22.346 --> 03:32:26.744
LIAM: Right this very minute, he's a one-ounce
owl.

03:32:26.744 --> 03:32:28.320
SAM: He needs to change.

03:32:28.320 --> 03:32:29.573
TALIESIN: How long does that take?

03:32:29.573 --> 03:32:30.499
LIAM: Ten minutes.

03:32:30.499 --> 03:32:31.572
SAM: We've got ten minutes.

03:32:31.572 --> 03:32:33.415
MARISHA: Go! Go. Go, go, go.

03:32:33.415 --> 03:32:34.675
LIAM: Stall for me.

03:32:34.675 --> 03:32:36.175
SAM: What about the jewels? Should we get rid of
the jewels?

03:32:36.175 --> 03:32:37.068
TALIESIN: The whole thing.

03:32:37.068 --> 03:32:38.365
MARISHA: Send it with the book.

03:32:38.365 --> 03:32:42.090
MATT: The next minute goes by, and two more
figures show up and they go, "We're going to the

03:32:42.090 --> 03:32:44.814
"ship now, gather your things. There's no more
waiting. Come on."

03:32:44.814 --> 03:32:46.365
LAURA: Okay, okay.

03:32:46.365 --> 03:32:47.988
SAM: We'll do it on the way.

03:32:47.988 --> 03:32:50.890
LAURA: I have to get dressed, that's all. That's
the thing

03:32:50.890 --> 03:32:58.751
MATT: You get a sense from the vocality here that
things are not right. Probably relating to events

03:32:58.751 --> 03:33:00.746
that transpired through the evening.

03:33:00.746 --> 03:33:02.469
MARISHA: Gee, I wonder.

03:33:02.469 --> 03:33:04.626
LAURA: Okay.

03:33:04.626 --> 03:33:08.590
TRAVIS: You could just pop out of the room and
meet us on the way.

03:33:08.590 --> 03:33:12.448
SAM: Well yeah, they're not in the room. Do you
want to pop out of the room?

03:33:12.448 --> 03:33:13.549
TALIESIN: Pop out of the room that--

03:33:13.549 --> 03:33:16.691
TRAVIS: No, I mean Jester pops out of the room
with the bag and leave it somewhere, then meet us

03:33:16.691 --> 03:33:18.260
on the way to the ship.

03:33:18.260 --> 03:33:19.300
SAM: Oh that. The haversack?

03:33:19.300 --> 03:33:20.380
TRAVIS: Dimension door the fuck out of the room.

03:33:20.380 --> 03:33:22.179
SAM: Well what are we doing with the book and
stuff?

03:33:22.179 --> 03:33:23.447
TRAVIS: Not now.

03:33:23.447 --> 03:33:29.872
MATT: By the way, all of your doors now are being
held open and they're expectantly waiting. The

03:33:29.872 --> 03:33:34.198
crew doesn't trust you, and they haven't really
since you've been here. They're not like, "Cool,

03:33:34.198 --> 03:33:38.420
"guys, let's go!" There's very much a, "We're
getting everybody in there and shit, there's going

03:33:38.420 --> 03:33:39.609
"to be conversations."

03:33:39.609 --> 03:33:42.194
TRAVIS: There's no time. We're going down.

03:33:42.194 --> 03:33:51.715
MATT: You gather your things, head outside.
Bouldergut's keeping a watch from behind. Other

03:33:51.715 --> 03:33:56.192
members of the crew are being gathered and ushered
in, as well as the crew from the Mistake and Orly.

03:33:56.192 --> 03:34:00.225
Everyone's being brought over towards the docks.

03:34:00.225 --> 03:34:04.935
SAM: Do you want me to sleight of hand throw the
bag down an alley as we walk?

03:34:04.935 --> 03:34:05.804
LAURA: The whole bag?

03:34:05.804 --> 03:34:06.430
SAM: Sure.

03:34:06.430 --> 03:34:07.358
TALIESIN: Oof.

03:34:07.358 --> 03:34:11.305
SAM: Got to get rid of it.

03:34:11.305 --> 03:34:12.623
TRAVIS: No!

03:34:12.623 --> 03:34:13.798
SAM: We've gotta get rid of it!

03:34:13.798 --> 03:34:18.874
TRAVIS: No. I'd rather fight over it than lose a
check, just going like, "Uh!"

03:34:18.874 --> 03:34:21.758
SAM: I'm super fast.

03:34:21.758 --> 03:34:23.272
TRAVIS: All right. Do what you're going to do.

03:34:23.272 --> 03:34:24.864
LAURA: I don't want to lose the whole haversack.

03:34:24.864 --> 03:34:25.937
TRAVIS: Do what you've got to do.

03:34:25.937 --> 03:34:31.656
LAURA: I do not want to lose the whole haversack.
Nope. It's got the Dodecahedron in it.

03:34:31.656 --> 03:34:34.950
SAM: Just toss it, and then we'll come back for
it. Behind a dumpster.

03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:36.433
LAURA: Nope!

03:34:36.433 --> 03:34:37.801
TALIESIN. No.

03:34:37.801 --> 03:34:43.849
MATT: You guys at this point have been brought to
the docks now, and you're being pushed toward the

03:34:43.849 --> 03:34:50.537
direction-- You can see the Squalleater there
waiting, and there a number of figures already on deck.

03:34:50.537 --> 03:34:54.518
LAURA: Is there ever a moment it looks like
nobody's looking at us, or me?

03:34:54.518 --> 03:34:56.620
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:35:04.083 --> 03:35:05.234
LAURA: No. Seven.

03:35:05.234 --> 03:35:08.449
MATT: You don't know. You don't see anybody,
necessarily. You have Bouldergut walking behind

03:35:08.449 --> 03:35:11.823
you, and other people are being ushered in.

03:35:11.823 --> 03:35:14.085
LAURA: Can I fall back and talk to Bouldergut?

03:35:14.085 --> 03:35:15.062
MATT: Sure.

03:35:15.062 --> 03:35:17.175
LAURA: Bouldergut, what is going on right now?

03:35:17.175 --> 03:35:19.988
MATT: "I don't know. I wanted to sleep longer."

03:35:19.988 --> 03:35:27.588
LAURA: Me too! Everybody seems so angry at
everybody else. Look at the ship right now! It

03:35:27.588 --> 03:35:30.671
looks crazy, all these people walking around.

03:35:30.671 --> 03:35:34.849
MATT: "I know, I want to just eat breakfast."

03:35:34.849 --> 03:35:41.923
LAURA: Me too! While I'm talking to her and
hopefully when I point at the ship-- Does she look

03:35:41.923 --> 03:35:44.338
where I point?

03:35:44.338 --> 03:35:49.131
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:35:49.131 --> 03:35:50.580
SAM: Look, it's a space shuttle.

03:35:50.580 --> 03:35:52.569
LIAM: Dumb as a brick.

03:35:55.377 --> 03:35:56.786
LAURA: 22.

03:35:56.786 --> 03:35:58.981
MATT: Yeah, just follows your eyeline over.

03:35:58.981 --> 03:36:03.554
LAURA: I reach in the bag and I pull out the
jewels and I dump them off the side. I want them

03:36:03.554 --> 03:36:07.119
to fall in the water as we're walking.

03:36:07.119 --> 03:36:12.365
MATT: Okay, so all the jewels (bubble noises) into
the water. Okay. Make a sleight of hand check.

03:36:12.365 --> 03:36:23.780
LAURA: (singing) I wish I had looked at the
Dodecahedron this morning. (normal voice) 15?

03:36:23.780 --> 03:36:29.377
MATT: 15? Okay. You drop them off the side. As far
as you're concerned, no one noticed.

03:36:29.377 --> 03:36:31.445
TRAVIS: Who else was walking with us besides
Bouldergut?

03:36:31.445 --> 03:36:32.738
LAURA: Bouldergut was in the back, though.

03:36:32.738 --> 03:36:40.003
MATT: Bouldergut was in the back, and there were a
few other-- First off, you have Waldok, Zoen are

03:36:40.003 --> 03:36:47.154
with you guys. Bark you see being brought over
from another side as well. It looks like he either

03:36:47.154 --> 03:36:53.305
stayed somewhere else or was somewhere else when
he was gathered up by the crew and the guard. The

03:36:53.305 --> 03:37:00.122
guard only-- None of them go on the ship, but they
lead you over to the edge of the dock and watch

03:37:00.122 --> 03:37:04.838
you all go onto the deck and begin to walk away.

03:37:04.838 --> 03:37:06.409
SAM: Where's the book right now?

03:37:06.409 --> 03:37:08.706
LIAM: It's in Caleb's possession isn't it?

03:37:08.706 --> 03:37:09.653
SAM: Yeah.

03:37:09.653 --> 03:37:12.753
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:37:13.237 --> 03:37:21.103
MATT: Okay. You guys walk along the plank up onto
the deck and there you see Avantika, Vera, the

03:37:21.103 --> 03:37:28.087
rest of the crew, are all there. You can see the
crew of the Mistake are brought to the edge of the

03:37:28.087 --> 03:37:33.522
dock, and are held there, waiting. You guys are
brought up on there.

03:37:33.522 --> 03:37:35.439
MARISHA: Where's the Mistake?

03:37:35.439 --> 03:37:39.208
MATT: You don't know where the Mistake is docked.
You didn't see it when you came in. There are

03:37:39.208 --> 03:37:47.869
probably 20-plus ships that are all across the
docks here. As you guys are brought to the edge of

03:37:47.869 --> 03:37:49.122
the ship--

03:37:49.122 --> 03:37:50.608
TRAVIS: I am burning so many calories right now.

03:37:50.608 --> 03:37:52.122
MARISHA: I'm dying. I've never felt more in
trouble.

03:37:52.122 --> 03:37:53.811
SAM: We've got to get this book off the fucking
boat!

03:37:53.811 --> 03:37:55.395
MATT: Well, you're on the deck right now.

03:37:55.395 --> 03:37:58.225
TRAVIS: That's the most sure way to get it seen.

03:37:58.225 --> 03:38:01.674
MATT: The deck of the Squalleater. Avantika sees
you approach and goes, "Good morning, everyone!

03:38:01.674 --> 03:38:10.318
"Good morning. Well, I apologize for the problems.
This should only take a moment to discuss. It

03:38:10.318 --> 03:38:19.494
"appears we've a bit of an incident overnight, and
I wanted to let everyone know there may have been

03:38:19.494 --> 03:38:31.824
"some issues rifling through. Over here, Waldok was
so unfortunately shivved by one of our

03:38:31.824 --> 03:38:42.037
"compatriots," and shoots a glare over at Zoen,
who's like, "I'm sorry! I'm sorry." "But it has

03:38:42.037 --> 03:38:48.616
"come to our attention that there has also been...
Well, to be perfectly honest, a break-in to my

03:38:48.616 --> 03:38:50.055
"personal chambers."

03:38:50.055 --> 03:38:51.326
MARISHA: (gasp)

03:38:51.326 --> 03:39:02.687
MATT: "I know. Some of my personal belongings have
gone missing, and I wanted to ask if anybody has

03:39:02.687 --> 03:39:09.904
"seen anything throughout the night. I already
spoke with a few of the crew who were here before.

03:39:09.904 --> 03:39:17.052
"I have not spoken with you, Waldok. Did you see
anything?" Waldok goes, "I was sleeping, and

03:39:17.052 --> 03:39:22.457
"suddenly this piece of shit fell through the
ceiling, and landed on top of me, and I was

03:39:22.457 --> 03:39:31.367
"just--" It was the other way around. Waldok got
stabbed. So Waldok goes, "I was walking, and I

03:39:31.367 --> 03:39:37.066
"heard some noise inside your chambers. I went to
inspect it, unlocked the door, went in, and things

03:39:37.066 --> 03:39:43.434
"seemed fine, but then I fell through the fucking
floor, onto Zoen, and he was sitting in bed

03:39:43.434 --> 03:39:49.249
"sleeping, and he just fucking started stabbing
me!" Zoen's like, "You woke me up, what am I

03:39:49.249 --> 03:40:00.436
"supposed to do?! And where the fuck are we?"
"Anyway, we looked at the floor, and somebody had

03:40:00.436 --> 03:40:09.865
"broken the floor, probably snuck in somehow." The
captain goes, "Thank you for that. Also, it

03:40:09.865 --> 03:40:21.592
"appears that Bark here had strange delusions and
fell. Or leapt, apparently, from the crow's nest.

03:40:21.592 --> 03:40:27.761
"Did you see anything in particular?" He's like, "I
mean, it was crazy! It caught fire, and then I

03:40:27.761 --> 03:40:34.437
"jumped to get away from it, and there was no
fire." She goes, "So it appears that there may

03:40:34.437 --> 03:40:46.069
"have been some sort of distraction. Well, has
anybody else seen anything of particular interest

03:40:46.069 --> 03:40:54.898
"last night? And by the way, Caduceus, I heard that
you were very helpful in helping our compatriots

03:40:54.971 --> 03:40:56.663
"with their wounds."

03:40:56.663 --> 03:40:57.891
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was no problem.

03:40:57.891 --> 03:40:59.406
MATT: "I appreciate you being a team player."

03:40:59.406 --> 03:41:04.645
TALIESIN: Well, it looked-- That leg was pretty
rough. Hmm.

03:41:05.032 --> 03:41:09.432
TRAVIS: Is this a frequent occurrence when you're
in Darktow? This sort of--

03:41:09.432 --> 03:41:17.241
MATT: "Oh, certainly not. To be perfectly honest,
whoever did this does not understand the rules of

03:41:17.241 --> 03:41:20.002
"the city very well."

03:41:20.002 --> 03:41:28.886
TALIESIN: I can-- No. I can find creatures. I
can't find objects.

03:41:28.886 --> 03:41:40.495
MATT: "Hmm. Vera?" Vera's sitting back there and
nods. You see her fingers trace this weird symbol

03:41:40.495 --> 03:41:46.851
in the air that leaves a slight trace. Her eyes
flare for a second and she goes, "But that is

03:41:46.851 --> 03:41:50.866
"okay. Because I can."

03:41:52.677 --> 03:41:57.878
LIAM: I take a bit of phosphorus and squelch it
through my hand and cast Wall of Fire across the

03:41:57.878 --> 03:42:01.192
entire length of the boat between them and us.

03:42:01.192 --> 03:42:02.094
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:42:02.094 --> 03:42:02.880
MARISHA: Holy shit.

03:42:02.880 --> 03:42:04.177
MATT: That's where we're going to pick up next
week.

03:42:04.177 --> 03:42:08.564
(screaming)

03:42:08.564 --> 03:42:10.354
MARISHA: The gauntlet has been thrown!

03:42:10.354 --> 03:42:12.915
LAURA: Oh my god!

03:42:15.685 --> 03:42:17.151
LIAM: I'm sweating.

03:42:18.241 --> 03:42:22.897
MATT: Next week we pick up in the shipyard of
Darktow, on the deck--

03:42:23.242 --> 03:42:24.533
MARISHA: Not next week!

03:42:24.533 --> 03:42:25.526
MATT: Sorry, in two weeks--

03:42:25.526 --> 03:42:28.223
(screaming)

03:42:28.223 --> 03:42:34.217
MATT: Oh my god, in two weeks! Oh, no! Curse you,
Thanksgiving! On the deck of the Squalleater!

03:42:34.217 --> 03:42:38.241
LIAM: Like the salt on the rim of a margarita,
phosphorus through my hand.

03:42:38.241 --> 03:42:40.376
SAM: It's worth its weight in salt?

03:42:40.376 --> 03:42:42.703
MARISHA: Eyy.

03:42:42.703 --> 03:42:46.409
LAURA Ho-ly dang. I should have kept those
jewels!

03:42:46.409 --> 03:42:52.264
SAM: Flawless plan, executed flawlessly.

03:42:52.264 --> 03:42:56.097
MATT: It was a pretty good plan. There were just a
couple of loose ends!

03:42:56.097 --> 03:42:58.726
LIAM: We should have worked out Frumpkin in
advance.

03:42:58.726 --> 03:43:00.847
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

03:43:00.847 --> 03:43:03.009
LIAM: I thought we'd have time in the morning.

03:43:03.009 --> 03:43:06.654
MATT: There were a few moments to possibly discard
a couple of key objects.

03:43:06.654 --> 03:43:10.359
MARISHA: But we got the information we needed!

03:43:10.359 --> 03:43:12.798
MATT: This is good, but you got the information
you needed, and this is going to be a hell of a

03:43:12.798 --> 03:43:18.788
start to the next session! Oh, man! I wasn't
expecting it to go this way!

03:43:18.788 --> 03:43:22.185
MARISHA: Info is golden.

03:43:22.185 --> 03:43:26.168
MATT: All right, we'll pick up here in a couple of
weeks. We're sad we won't see you guys next week

03:43:26.168 --> 03:43:30.359
for Thanksgiving. What do we have going on over
Thanksgiving?

03:43:30.359 --> 03:43:36.137
MARISHA: Well the day after Thanksgiving on Friday
is Honey Heist 3: Tova's Honeys.

03:43:36.137 --> 03:43:39.922
MATT: There we go. We're sad we'll be missing you
on Thursday, but on Friday we do have that awesome.

03:43:39.922 --> 03:43:48.352
MARISHA: On Friday, watch us as bears? Stealing
honey instead of very invaluable books and jewels?

03:43:48.352 --> 03:43:50.436
TALIESIN: It can only go better.

03:43:50.436 --> 03:43:53.201
SAM: (singing) It can only be better.

03:43:53.201 --> 03:43:55.317
MATT: Oh man. My heart's pumping.

03:43:55.317 --> 03:44:03.959
LIAM: The last ten minutes have been like, "Don't
cast it. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait. Okay."

03:44:03.959 --> 03:44:07.630
MARISHA: It felt like getting called into the
principal's office. You're like, "Fuck."

03:44:07.630 --> 03:44:09.442
LAURA: Yeah. And like, a principal that always
knows when you're lying.

03:44:09.442 --> 03:44:10.476
MARISHA and LIAM: Yes.

03:44:10.476 --> 03:44:16.100
TALIESIN: We have video, man. I didn't do it.

03:44:16.100 --> 03:44:23.033
MATT: Well, see you guys in a couple of weeks to
pick up from this crazy moment. Until then, thank

03:44:23.033 --> 03:44:28.200
you, we love you very much, and is it Thursday
yet? Goodnight, guys.

03:44:28.200 --> 03:44:30.476
TRAVIS: We're going to war!

03:44:37.640 --> 03:53:13.942

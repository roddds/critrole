00:00:00.965 --> 00:00:03.537
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:06.122
nerdy ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:07.647
SAM: Dirty ass voice actors?

00:00:07.647 --> 00:00:08.138
MATT: Yes.

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:09.093
LAURA: Is that what you said?

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:10.088
MATT: That is what I said.

00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:10.984
LIAM: That's accurate.

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:16.058
MATT: Yeah. Before we go into tonight's game, we
have a couple of quick announcements to go

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:21.811
through, one of which is kind of awesome. First
and foremost, we have our fantastic friends and

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:29.016
sponsors of this campaign thus far and going on to
infinity, D&amp;amp;D Beyond. Sam, if you want to talk a

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:30.474
little bit about that, please.

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:42.061
SAM: Hey everybody, D&amp;amp;D Beyond wanted
to
know that Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes is out.

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:47.895
Big news here guys, it's not Mordenkainen's, and
it's not a Tomb of Foes, as I've been saying it.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:51.688
It's Mordenkainen's Tomb-- Tome of Foes. Fuck!

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:54.726
(laughter)

00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:59.418
SAM: You can purchase it right now at D&amp;amp;D Beyond
on their website. Also, if a player in your

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:05.027
campaign has a master level subscription, any
player, not just the DM, that owns Mordenkainen's

00:01:05.027 --> 00:01:10.505
Tome of Foes can share content with everyone in
the party. But the real announcement tonight is

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:20.525
that D&amp;amp;D Beyond has gone beyond. They've made a
thing that I made, but then they took it and they

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:26.975
made it, but it's even better than I made it.
We're going to play it for you tonight, and you

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:29.894
might enjoy it. Have you guys seen it yet?

00:01:29.894 --> 00:01:31.031
LIAM: We're about to!

00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:37.055
SAM: It's so good! Okay, roll that tape.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.822
SAM: Yeah, they did it.

SAM: It's so good.

00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:48.844
MATT: It's weirdly emotional.

00:02:48.844 --> 00:02:58.434
SAM: It's all of our characters, animated! We have
to give some shout outs to Kamille and Kevin

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:15.954
Areopagita for working on this. Those were the
animators. Go visit at Twitter @Karekareo. We'll

00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:28.410
put it up on the thing. You can visit their
Patreon, Patreon.com/kiframe. It's really cool,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.169
and it's really fast, so we thought we might play
it again.

TALIESIN: Thank you, Sam!

00:04:33.736 --> 00:04:36.861
SAM: It's not me, it's them! It's the D&amp;amp;D!

00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:38.991
TRAVIS: Those fucking vocals, son. That shit.

00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:42.510
MATT: How layered was that harmony at the end?

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.955
SAM: I did like seven or 12 tracks of harmony.
There's all kinds of stuff going on.

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:54.421
TRAVIS: The synth gives me 80s life in the best
way.

00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:59.839
SAM: The drum fill at the end: there's a real drum
fill, but it's also me going: Do do, do do, do do.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:02.698
(laughter)

00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:07.459
MATT: Seriously, Kamille, Kevin Areopagita, you
guys are amazing. Such an incredible job on that.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:13.498
I want to plug their Patreon again because they
deserve it. That's patreon.com/kiframe. Go check

00:05:13.498 --> 00:05:14.844
out their work. They're fantastic.

00:05:14.844 --> 00:05:15.636
ASHLEY: Unreal.

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:17.232
TRAVIS: I will be watching that on repeat until
3:00am.

00:05:17.232 --> 00:05:18.967
MATT: Yeah. Yeah, I know.

00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:21.693
LIAM: Can we all cry if we can get the whole game
tonight?

00:05:21.693 --> 00:05:27.341
MATT: It wouldn't be Critical Role if we didn't at
some point. Thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond, for being

00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:36.073
fantastic partners in this and for making that
shit happen! (voice cracking) Okay, moving on. Oh man.

00:05:36.073 --> 00:05:37.668
LIAM: (voice cracking) Emotional cry!

00:05:37.777 --> 00:05:43.653
MATT: I know! Vox Machina: Origins, the hardcover,
the physical copy went on sale today! It is

00:05:43.653 --> 00:05:47.172
available for purchase now through our friends at
Dark Horse. You can find all the details at

00:05:47.172 --> 00:05:52.950

bunch of extras in the back. The art process and

00:05:58.313 --> 00:06:02.079

Stilben, and a bunch of information about some of

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:05.925
the characters, creatures, and items that you see
throughout the story, for possible use in your

00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:11.510
home game. But anyway, check it out. I hope you
enjoy it. We're real proud of it. Stream of Many

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:19.447
Eyes starts tomorrow. Ashley and me are going to
be playing on a game tomorrow night for Force Grey

00:06:19.447 --> 00:06:24.155
and then a bunch of us are going to be there on
Sunday throughout the day doing various games. You

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:30.153
can check out dnd.wizards.com/SoME for all the
information for this weekend. If you can't be

00:06:30.153 --> 00:06:33.408
there in person, they are streaming it so at least
you can check it all out there. It's going to be a

00:06:33.408 --> 00:06:35.814
lot of fun. Cool reveals, and crazy stuff.

00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:38.275
LAURA and TALIESIN: So crazy.

00:06:38.275 --> 00:06:43.475
MATT: It's so crazy. Talks Machina is every
Tuesday evening at 7:00pm Pacific where our

00:06:43.475 --> 00:06:48.869
fantastic, recently-escaped-from-the-Far-Realm
Brian W. Foster will be hosting. This is discussed

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:52.652
next week on the things that happened in this
week's episode you're about to see. So check it

00:06:52.652 --> 00:07:00.313
out. It should be fun. I will be at A-Kon, June
8th to the 10th. So in a couple weeks, I'll be out

00:07:00.313 --> 00:07:04.258
there at Dallas/Fort Worth for panels, signings
and going to talk and hang out with people as much

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:07.880
as I can. So if you're in that area, come say
hello! I believe--

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.075
LAURA: Wait, I've got one thing.

00:07:10.075 --> 00:07:11.949
MATT: Oh, what you got? What you got, Laura?

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.715
LAURA: Oh well, I was just perusing our store
recently because sometimes I do that.

00:07:16.715 --> 00:07:17.885
SAM: Full of good stuff!

00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:21.473
LAURA: It is full of good stuff, but something I
noticed that we haven't announced is that the

00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:23.711
rings that we had forever ago.

00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:24.951
TRAVIS: The d20 ring?

00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:29.778
LAURA: The d20 spinner rings? Those things are in
the store right now. I don't know if we found a

00:07:29.778 --> 00:07:35.580
stockpile of them that we had missed, but there
are some in the store right now. Just so you

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:35.927
know.

00:07:35.927 --> 00:07:38.418
TRAVIS: Where the 20 is the CR logo, too?

00:07:38.418 --> 00:07:39.236
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:42.659
LAURA: I know, we just found some, I guess,
because they're there! There's a bunch of other

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:47.620
stuff, too, t-shirts and stuff, but the spinner
ring is there for maybe five more seconds. Maybe.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.378
I don't know.

00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:52.317
MATT: I do like the idea that we have mystery
caches of old items showing up. It's a perpetual

00:07:52.317 --> 00:07:54.200
surprise! You'll never know what you'll see!

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.270
LIAM: And new items. New items on sale right now.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.109
TRAVIS: It's so pretty!

00:08:01.109 --> 00:08:11.574
LIAM: Look at this. Also, hi, Dread Singles, feel
better! Look at that! Look at it on paper! Look at

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.132
the color! We can hold it and taste it and smell
it!

00:08:14.132 --> 00:08:18.650
MATT: Olivia Samson, our fantastic Critter artist,
did such a great job on this series. If you

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:24.260
haven't had a chance to look at her work, please
do. She's amazing. And on that note, let us all

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.455
jump in to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:08:28.455 --> 00:08:30.112
TRAVIS: (drum beat)

00:08:30.112 --> 00:08:34.248
[click, TV static]

00:08:34.248 --> 00:09:51.634
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:09:52.055 --> 00:09:55.238
MATT: And welcome back. That was pretty creative.
Well done.

00:09:55.238 --> 00:09:56.466
LIAM: He would totally do that.

00:09:56.466 --> 00:10:05.290
MATT: Hmm, that's a 6th-level spell. Anyway,
welcome back. To catch up on what previously

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:11.749
occurred. The Mighty Nein had decided to leave
Zadash in the wake of the now declared war between

00:10:11.749 --> 00:10:19.545
the Dwendalian Empire and the Xhorhasian hordes to
the east. You decided to side with The Gentleman,

00:10:19.545 --> 00:10:26.503
a purveyor of various darker and underhanded deeds
throughout this side of the Empire who offered you

00:10:26.503 --> 00:10:33.615
two possible contracted options. You chose both
and proceeded onto your first leg of this journey

00:10:33.615 --> 00:10:38.160
to the northeast to the Labenda Swamp and to the
city of Berleben where you were tasked to discover

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.645
what had happened to a safe house of which various
smuggled goods would be stored and then

00:10:43.645 --> 00:10:50.063
transported through, that had gone dark for a
number of weeks. You packed up, made your way in

00:10:50.063 --> 00:10:56.387
that direction, traversed through the outskirts of
the swamp, managed to save a tiny bird friend from

00:10:56.387 --> 00:11:06.303
being consumed by a few large crocodiles and
scoured the swamp city of Berleben in search of

00:11:06.303 --> 00:11:10.667
some means of information to find the individual
that The Gentleman says would be able to help you

00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:18.038
in this journey, Febron. Febron was found, drunk
and disorderly, in the Keystone Pub.

00:11:18.038 --> 00:11:19.623
LAURA: That's so sexy.

00:11:19.623 --> 00:11:28.366
MATT: Oh, so sexy. He's a right nice one. But no.
You managed to interrogate him, made him an offer

00:11:28.366 --> 00:11:34.852
he couldn't refuse and he agreed to lead you onto
where the safe house exists within the swamp. You

00:11:34.852 --> 00:11:41.605
rented out the rooms in the subterranean chambers
of the old and almost collapsed pub. You separated

00:11:41.605 --> 00:11:47.083
yourselves for the evening, completed your rest
and we pick up as morning comes to greet you.

00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:51.477
Lightless, as there are no windows and you just
eventually come to on what you assume is an

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:58.516
evening's full rest. You all independently come to
shake your heads and get yourselves prepared for

00:11:58.516 --> 00:12:07.321
what the next day's journey arises, you gather
your things and you glare at the rather awkward

00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:11.371
Febron across the way, who, as you wake up, is
just sitting there watching you sleep.

00:12:11.371 --> 00:12:13.247
MARISHA and LAURA: Ew.

00:12:13.737 --> 00:12:20.244
ASHLEY: You're so creepy. I'm going to pull the
bed out from the door. Are you ready to get up?

00:12:20.794 --> 00:12:24.230
MATT: Well, I mean, I'm ready to do whatever you
want. Lead the way.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.523
ASHLEY: Great. (retches) Okay. Open the door,
we'll head upstairs.

00:12:31.523 --> 00:12:32.927
MATT: You guys begin to--

00:12:32.927 --> 00:12:36.230
LAURA: We wake up all cuddled in a pile in our
room.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.857
MARISHA: Yeah. Just floofy with Kiri in between.

00:12:38.857 --> 00:12:40.490
MATT: (chirping)

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.279
LAURA: A little cuddle pile.

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:44.053
MATT: (like Jester) "It's sharp!"

00:12:46.273 --> 00:12:49.913
LAURA: You don't sleep with the daggers, Kiri. You
want to remove them.

00:12:49.913 --> 00:12:51.994
MATT: (chirping)

00:12:51.994 --> 00:12:53.507
LAURA: We should have taught her that last night.

00:12:53.507 --> 00:12:56.093
MARISHA: Yeah, that's pretty-- I'm glad we're
alive.

00:12:58.763 --> 00:13:04.146
MATT: You guys all begin to gather and make your
way up the ladder, through the hatch in the floor

00:13:04.146 --> 00:13:09.808
of the Keystone Pub, which is not bustling by any
means. There are maybe three patrons in the

00:13:09.808 --> 00:13:15.575
process of having their morning ale. You glance
over the side and you can see Dent Bonswallow

00:13:15.575 --> 00:13:19.887
who's in the process of cleaning off a number of
the glasses from the night before. He looks over

00:13:19.887 --> 00:13:23.813
in your direction and goes, "Oh, right. Bright
morning to you all. Rise up! Would you like

00:13:23.813 --> 00:13:25.400
breakfast of some kind, hey?"

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.422
TRAVIS: That's a lot of fucking energy this early
in the morning. God. (clears throat)

00:13:30.422 --> 00:13:33.822
LAURA: I would like so much of whatever you have,
please, thank you.

00:13:33.822 --> 00:13:37.519
MATT: "Right. Coming right up! Go an find a place
to sit, be with you in about an hour."

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:39.294
ALL: An hour?!

00:13:39.294 --> 00:13:41.220
MATT: "Well, I've got to make your food!"

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.065
(grumbling)

00:13:43.065 --> 00:13:44.788
TRAVIS: Do you have to go and kill it first?

00:13:45.298 --> 00:13:48.702
MATT: He's counting. "About an hour."

00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:51.367
LAURA: Ugh. That's a long time.

00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:53.224
TRAVIS: Yeah. What are we going to do until then?

00:13:53.224 --> 00:13:55.120
SAM: It's like an Easy-Bake Oven.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.571
TRAVIS: I mean, should we explore the street that
we're on? I mean, we've got a long wait time.

00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:06.670
SAM: Should we see if the-- oh, no. The horses
were taken.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.649
TRAVIS: They took the cart.

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:08.540
LAURA: To the stables.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:16.201
MATT: Yeah, that's all situated there. There is,
in the far corner of the chamber, the back wall

00:14:16.201 --> 00:14:20.492
opposite to the right of where the stage is being
constructed-- though right now, it looks like

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:25.902
there's no current construction going on at the
moment-- a hooded figure is slowly walking towards

00:14:25.902 --> 00:14:28.273
the table where you guys are deciding or not
whether to sit.

00:14:29.273 --> 00:14:31.084
LAURA: We run for it and we get the table first.

00:14:32.194 --> 00:14:38.172
MATT: Okay. You manage to sit on one of the small
benches on the side. Scrapes the ground as you

00:14:38.172 --> 00:14:39.492
push into the side and the--

00:14:39.492 --> 00:14:43.672
MARISHA: I take my staff and I lay it long ways
over the entire bench on the other side.

00:14:43.672 --> 00:14:45.109
TRAVIS: The old movie theater grab?

00:14:45.109 --> 00:14:45.623
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:14:46.463 --> 00:14:55.284
MATT: The cloaked figure stops and takes in this
physical display, and then continues to approach.

00:14:55.284 --> 00:14:59.461
LIAM: Frumpkin walks to the edge of the table and
shows his butthole by lifting his tail up.

00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:01.643
MATT: Mark, if you want to step in.

00:15:01.643 --> 00:15:05.233
(laughter)

00:15:05.233 --> 00:15:07.102
MARISHA: We're always so mean to the guests!

00:15:08.462 --> 00:15:12.787
MATT: Mark Hulmes, long-time friend, dungeon
master of High Rollers.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:17.008
LIAM: I just can't believe he got here.

00:15:17.008 --> 00:15:17.772
MARK: You tried.

00:15:22.462 --> 00:15:27.071
MATT: The first thing you see: the individuals you
have been waiting throughout the evening to show

00:15:27.071 --> 00:15:31.955
up begin to step through, groggily complain about
the space and then claim a table as you begin to

00:15:31.955 --> 00:15:37.028
approach, which you are greeted with stares and a
cat butthole.

00:15:38.478 --> 00:15:44.971
LAURA: This table is taken by The Mighty Nein, but
if you need anything, there's other tables.

00:15:44.971 --> 00:15:55.137
MARK: Oh yeah. Hi, actually, I kind of-- You see
this feminine-looking figure. Long black hair that

00:15:55.137 --> 00:16:01.831
covers almost the entire side of her left face,
wearing a hood up, dark green cloak, black and

00:16:01.831 --> 00:16:06.963
green clothes, you can occasionally see green
ribbons in her long hair. She is like: I'm really

00:16:06.963 --> 00:16:12.944
sorry to bother you guys, just-- I couldn't help
but overhear some conversation you had last-- I'm

00:16:12.944 --> 00:16:15.422
sorry to be really forward. Are you heading into
the swamp today?

00:16:15.422 --> 00:16:17.494
MARISHA: You were listening in to our
conversations?

00:16:17.494 --> 00:16:24.118
MARK: Not on purpose. I'm really desperate to find
a way into the swamp and you were talking really loudly.

00:16:24.462 --> 00:16:26.523
LAURA: I like your ribbons.

00:16:26.523 --> 00:16:30.897
MARK: Thank you. Oh my-- you're blue! And she
(gasps) And she looks up at you.

00:16:30.897 --> 00:16:32.060
LAURA: You're not.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:37.085
MARK: No. I mean, you're so cute! And looks
around.

00:16:37.725 --> 00:16:41.563
TRAVIS: If you don't mind us asking, why are you
heading into the swamp yourself?

00:16:41.563 --> 00:16:45.362
MARK: Oh. Well, it's kind of a long story just--

00:16:45.362 --> 00:16:47.536
LIAM: Oh, well we have an hour.

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:59.307
MARK: It's also a bit of, well, I mean. You guys
haven't been hired by any creepy people in dragon

00:16:59.307 --> 00:17:02.013
masks, have you? You don't know anyone like that?

00:17:02.013 --> 00:17:05.785
MARISHA: I mean, not for several years for a
different reason.

00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:08.366
TALIESIN: Definitely a long time since I've dealt
with anyone in a dragon mask.

00:17:08.366 --> 00:17:10.599
LAURA: I've never seen anyone in a dragon mask
before.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:18.929
SAM: We've been hired by creepy people, but not
by-- Oh, so I'm wearing a mask, but that is a

00:17:18.929 --> 00:17:22.124
different kind of mask. It's not a dragon mask.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:23.495
MARISHA: Same kind of creepy, though.

00:17:23.495 --> 00:17:24.755
LAURA: And this is a bird.

00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:26.327
MATT: (chirping)

00:17:26.327 --> 00:17:27.317
MARK: What is that?

00:17:27.317 --> 00:17:28.487
LAURA and TALIESIN: A bird.

00:17:28.487 --> 00:17:30.244
MARK: Like, it walks around?

00:17:30.244 --> 00:17:31.381
MATT: (like Jester) "A bird."

00:17:31.381 --> 00:17:32.524
LAURA: She. She walks around.

00:17:32.524 --> 00:17:34.011
MATT: (like Jester) "She walks around."

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.472
TRAVIS: Repeats stuff, yeah.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:36.424
MARK: Oh my god.

00:17:36.424 --> 00:17:37.498
LAURA: She's kind of the best.

00:17:37.498 --> 00:17:39.197
MARK: She's adorable! Hello?

00:17:39.197 --> 00:17:40.845
MATT: (like Cali) "Hello?"

00:17:40.845 --> 00:17:43.917
SAM: She's doing you.

00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:46.036
MATT: (whistles)

00:17:46.036 --> 00:17:48.918
MARK: (stuttering) Oh my god.

00:17:48.918 --> 00:17:50.001
LIAM: Edubation.

00:17:50.001 --> 00:17:51.293
MATT: She pulls a dagger out.

00:17:51.293 --> 00:17:55.011
LAURA: No! Probably not so much like that.

00:17:55.011 --> 00:18:01.911
MARK: Wow. I've never seen a bird like that before
that can talk. Is that your daughter?

00:18:01.911 --> 00:18:06.076
TRAVIS: Yes. Yep. Mm-hmm.

00:18:06.076 --> 00:18:08.014
SAM: Yes, he's my dad.

00:18:08.014 --> 00:18:09.678
MARK: I can tell by the ears.

00:18:09.678 --> 00:18:10.834
LAURA: And the green.

00:18:10.834 --> 00:18:14.922
MARK: Yeah, that's what I thought. Green ears and
then like the-- anyway. Sorry, I'm getting

00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:18.802
distracted from what you asked me. That happens
sometimes. Just give me a nudge and I'll get back

00:18:18.802 --> 00:18:25.149
on track. There's something out in the swamp.
There's somewhere, like a smuggler's holdout or

00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:27.180
like a storehouse, I think maybe.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.893
LAURA: Mm. Weird. That's crazy.

00:18:28.893 --> 00:18:30.430
TALIESIN: That's a weird thing to put in the
middle of a swamp.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.987
LAURA: Yeah, well, anyway. What it is that you
need with that, though?

00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:41.616
MARK: Well, somebody was transporting an item I'm
looking for and I think it's there and I need to get

00:18:41.616 --> 00:18:46.474
it before some other people get it. But I'm not
stealing it. Well, I kind of am stealing it, but

00:18:46.474 --> 00:18:48.795
I'm taking it back for a good reason.

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.864
LAURA: Is it the people in the dragon masks that
want it?

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.711
MARK: Yeah, it is. You look trustworthy.

00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:59.036
TRAVIS: Are you getting paid for this item
retrieval?

00:18:59.036 --> 00:18:59.858
MARK: Me?

00:18:59.858 --> 00:19:00.531
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:19:00.531 --> 00:19:04.818
MARK: No. It's more of a personal thing. I want to
make sure it doesn't get into the wrong hands.

00:19:04.818 --> 00:19:07.277
LAURA: Is it your underwear?

00:19:07.277 --> 00:19:08.475
MARK: What?

00:19:08.475 --> 00:19:13.643
SAM: Yeah. What's the item? I mean. I'm sure my
father would want to know what's the item.

00:19:13.643 --> 00:19:14.946
MATT: (like Jester) "Your underwear?"

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:25.209
MARK: Well, it's a bowl? I know that sounds weird.
I think it's part of a ritual and I need to get it.

00:19:25.209 --> 00:19:27.608
SAM: Like a bowl or a bowl?

00:19:27.608 --> 00:19:33.774
MARK: I've never seen a bowl like that. You
couldn't get a lot of soup in a bowl like that

00:19:33.774 --> 00:19:36.930
big. I mean a big bowl.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.224
LAURA: It's a soup bowl, then?

00:19:38.224 --> 00:19:41.980
TRAVIS: What have you been doing after school?
Honey?

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.611
SAM: After-school activities.

00:19:43.611 --> 00:19:47.922
MARK: You have a very comfortable relationship.
It's really nice to see, to be honest.

00:19:47.922 --> 00:19:50.015
TRAVIS: Very open, yeah. We're like best friends.

00:19:50.015 --> 00:19:51.359
SAM: I tell him everything.

00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:53.857
MARK: That's good. You need to have that trust
between family.

00:19:53.857 --> 00:19:55.704
LIAM: You want to have a big bowl.

00:19:55.704 --> 00:19:57.017
TRAVIS: So you're searching for a bowl.

00:19:57.017 --> 00:19:58.477
MARK: Yeah. That's right.

00:19:58.477 --> 00:19:59.680
TRAVIS: And used in rituals?

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:07.035
MARK: I think so, yes. I need to make sure it
doesn't fall into the wrong hands, that's all.

00:20:07.035 --> 00:20:10.676
TRAVIS: Our business might be headed out that way
a little later today. Does she have any weapons on

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:11.991
her that are visible?

00:20:11.991 --> 00:20:14.585
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:20:14.585 --> 00:20:15.668
TRAVIS: Not me!

00:20:15.668 --> 00:20:17.616
MARISHA: You're not Grog anymore, it's okay.

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:18.761
TRAVIS: Yes. That's okay. 17.

00:20:18.761 --> 00:20:20.580
MATT: All right. Glancing about--

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:26.471
MARK: There's no obvious weapons that you can see
on her, but she has this long green cloak that's

00:20:26.471 --> 00:20:32.140
really covering her left side and you would
probably see that there's black scales all over

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:37.403
her left side and she's deliberately holding her
arm completely hidden. Her arm's invisible

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:38.943
underneath the cloak.

00:20:38.943 --> 00:20:43.584
LIAM: Also, I'm wondering if she seems
straightforward. Is the nervousness an act?

00:20:43.584 --> 00:20:45.131
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:20:45.131 --> 00:20:46.426
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

00:20:46.426 --> 00:20:51.205
MATT: Welcome to playing with Caleb.

00:20:51.205 --> 00:20:53.163
LAURA: Insight check. Insight check!

00:20:53.163 --> 00:20:55.204
MARK: I know. I've seen this show.

00:20:55.204 --> 00:20:57.034
LIAM: It's a 15.

00:20:57.034 --> 00:21:07.238
MATT: 15? Okay. It seems to be rather forthright.
Yeah. Seems to be on the level.

00:21:07.238 --> 00:21:08.664
LIAM: Okay.

00:21:08.664 --> 00:21:10.904
SAM: Which is not a good answer.

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:17.197
MATT: Yeah. She seems nervous.

00:21:17.197 --> 00:21:19.155
LIAM: Could go either way on that.

00:21:19.155 --> 00:21:25.197
MATT: You know, based on what you're asking. As
far as the features, if I recall, they're was it

00:21:25.197 --> 00:21:26.426
half-elven?

00:21:26.426 --> 00:21:32.547
MARK: Yeah. The human half looks half-elven, ever
so slightly elven features. Slightly pointed ear,

00:21:32.547 --> 00:21:34.778
but the left side covered.

00:21:34.778 --> 00:21:40.741
MARISHA: All right. So you're looking for a bowl.
A dangerous bowl.

00:21:40.741 --> 00:21:42.521
LAURA: A soup bowl used in rituals.

00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:43.764
MARK: Yeah.

00:21:43.764 --> 00:21:46.031
MARISHA: You don't want to get it in the wrong
hands because--

00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:48.317
TALIESIN: Of people in dragon masks.

00:21:48.317 --> 00:21:51.189
TRAVIS: Do you think they're sending people to get
it there before you?

00:21:51.189 --> 00:21:53.899
MARK: I love your jewelry by the way. It's really
nice.

00:21:53.899 --> 00:21:56.628
TALIESIN: Thank you. I've picked everything out
myself. This is all put together.

00:21:56.628 --> 00:21:57.911
LAURA: (tinkling)

00:21:57.911 --> 00:22:01.676
LIAM: Also, why do these people want the bowl that
you're talking about?

00:22:01.676 --> 00:22:08.775
MARK: They're-- Do any of them have holy symbols
or religious symbols anywhere on their person?

00:22:08.775 --> 00:22:10.070
TALIESIN: I'm literally covered in them.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.878
MARK: Of who?

00:22:11.878 --> 00:22:17.537
TALIESIN: Everybody. Literally, the coat is made
up of seven different options.

00:22:17.537 --> 00:22:20.073
MATT: Everybody who is legal within the Empire.

00:22:20.073 --> 00:22:23.637
TALIESIN: Yes. But there's also-- yeah.

00:22:23.637 --> 00:22:25.290
MARK: Is the Platinum Dragon one of those?

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.089
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm wearing a Platinum Dragon
necklace.

00:22:27.089 --> 00:22:33.031
MARK: Okay. She notices the Platinum Dragon. Are
you a worshipper of the Platinum Dragon by any chance?

00:22:33.031 --> 00:22:34.170
TALIESIN: Sure.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.465
MARK: Okay, yeah. Well, if you're traveling with
somebody who's a worshipper of the Platinum

00:22:38.465 --> 00:22:40.012
Dragon, I guess I can trust you.

00:22:40.012 --> 00:22:41.319
TRAVIS: Oh, good for us.

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:44.694
LAURA: He's incredibly trustworthy and he worships
like crazy.

00:22:44.694 --> 00:22:46.086
TALIESIN: That's what everybody says.

00:22:46.086 --> 00:22:48.522
MARK: Oh, by the gods, that's--

00:22:48.522 --> 00:22:50.693
TALIESIN: Remind me to show you my tapestries.

00:22:50.693 --> 00:22:51.881
MARK: Okay.

00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:53.142
TRAVIS: Is that code for something?

00:22:53.142 --> 00:22:54.773
TALIESIN: No, it's literally my tapestries.

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:56.245
MARISHA: Just don't touch them.

00:22:56.245 --> 00:22:58.809
LAURA: Because he's had them wrapped around his
weenie.

00:22:58.809 --> 00:23:03.001
MARK: Like. Oh my good-- uh, well, um.

00:23:03.001 --> 00:23:05.884
TALIESIN: She's high on sugar. Don't listen to
her. Anyway.

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:10.347
MARK: Yeah. Have you ever heard of the Scaled
Tyrant?

00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:11.836
TRAVIS and SAM: No.

00:23:11.836 --> 00:23:19.171
MARK: Well, it's probably a good thing. They're
not a very nice goddess and the worshippers of her

00:23:19.171 --> 00:23:24.614
are after this bowl and I need to stop them
getting it. They're not good people.

00:23:24.614 --> 00:23:29.484
TRAVIS: And you have a reason to believe that they
are expeditiously heading towards this bowl as well?

00:23:29.484 --> 00:23:33.979
MARK: They bought it and I think they're after it
now, yes.

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:41.054
LIAM: This is a very tactless question, but you
are talking about the Scaled Tyrant and you also

00:23:41.054 --> 00:23:44.100
are sporting some scales. Is that a coincidence or
are they related?

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:52.125
MARK: I'm sorry, a lot of people get really
nervous when they see them. I'm not diseased or

00:23:52.125 --> 00:23:54.487
cursed or anything just-- yeah, I've--

00:23:54.487 --> 00:23:56.091
LIAM: We're pretty cool.

00:23:56.091 --> 00:24:01.174
MARK: She brushes the hair to her side and she
adjusts the cloak and you can see the whole left

00:24:01.174 --> 00:24:05.223
side is black dragon scales and her hand is a
draconic claw.

00:24:05.223 --> 00:24:06.929
LAURA and ASHLEY: Whoa!

00:24:06.929 --> 00:24:14.355
MARK: A black dragon tail sweeps out from under
the cloak. I'm like a tenth dragon and some people

00:24:14.355 --> 00:24:15.978
get freaked out by that.

00:24:15.978 --> 00:24:17.580
MARISHA: You're sure you're just a tenth?

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:26.045
MARK: Yeah, I think so. All I know is that a great
ancestor of mine was a black dragon and I've

00:24:26.045 --> 00:24:28.113
inherited some of that.

00:24:28.113 --> 00:24:29.563
LAURA: Like a full dragon?

00:24:29.563 --> 00:24:33.507
MARK: Yeah, that's what I've been told.

00:24:33.507 --> 00:24:38.342
MATT: "I think it's pretty sexy to be honest." You
see Febron there, is this creepier old man,

00:24:38.342 --> 00:24:43.118
balding, little liver spotted, missing most of his
teeth, one eye wandering a bit.

00:24:43.118 --> 00:24:44.652
MARK: Is he with you?

00:24:44.652 --> 00:24:45.790
MARISHA: No.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.483
LAURA: Well, he's going to take us where we need
to go.

00:24:48.483 --> 00:24:49.545
MARK: Oh, so--

00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:50.977
LIAM: He's work for hire.

00:24:50.977 --> 00:24:58.714
MARK: Okay. All right. I'm just going to stand
next to Caleb, away from this guy.

00:24:58.714 --> 00:25:03.416
MARISHA: I've had shorter conversations with
family members. What's your name?

00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:07.266
MARK: Oh, sorry. I'm Calianna, you can call me
Cali.

00:25:07.266 --> 00:25:08.378
MARISHA: Kelly?

00:25:08.378 --> 00:25:09.444
MARK: Cali.

00:25:09.444 --> 00:25:11.532
MARISHA: Cali. Calianna, that's cool.

00:25:11.532 --> 00:25:15.040
MARK: Hi! Nice to meet you all. What are your
names?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.933
MATT: (like Nott) "Welcome to the Mighty Nein!"
The little bird creature begins to chirp in your

00:25:18.933 --> 00:25:19.989
direction.

00:25:19.989 --> 00:25:21.482
MARK: That's a really long name.

00:25:21.482 --> 00:25:22.751
LAURA: She's Kiri.

00:25:22.751 --> 00:25:27.938
MARK: Oh, Kiri. Hello Kiri. I am Cali.

00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:29.981
MATT: (like Cali) "Hello Kiri. I'm Cali."

00:25:29.981 --> 00:25:31.180
MARK: No you're Kiri.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.715
MATT: (like Cali) "You're Kiri."

00:25:35.715 --> 00:25:37.203
MARK: No, I'm Cali.

00:25:37.203 --> 00:25:39.601
MATT: (chirping)

00:25:39.601 --> 00:25:43.963
SAM: Only 56 more minutes until breakfast is
ready!

00:25:43.963 --> 00:25:54.789
MATT: For the sake of expediency, you share what
information you choose to in that space of time,

00:25:54.789 --> 00:26:03.466
but food does come to you piecemeal as your fine
Dent Bonswallow friend decides to deliver it plate by

00:26:03.466 --> 00:26:10.368
plate as it arrives. It's passable, most of it's a
little overcooked breakfast meats, bit of rubbery

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:15.101
egg and that's about it. A good swamp breakfast.

00:26:15.101 --> 00:26:18.315
LAURA: They need more sugar here.

00:26:18.315 --> 00:26:21.693
TRAVIS: Listen, we are kind of heading in that
direction.

00:26:21.693 --> 00:26:27.383
MARK: I won't be a burden or anything, but if you
don't mind me coming, I could use the help. The

00:26:27.383 --> 00:26:31.116
swamp, I've tried to go out in it by myself, and
there's something out there.

00:26:31.116 --> 00:26:32.861
LAURA: Gators. Giant ones.

00:26:32.861 --> 00:26:36.341
MARK: I've seen some of those, I avoided them.
But there's also something else. I haven't quite

00:26:36.341 --> 00:26:38.414
seen it yet.

00:26:38.414 --> 00:26:42.582
MATT: (growling) You hear this deep, horrible
growling sound that echoes around you.

00:26:42.582 --> 00:26:44.951
MARK: That's it, I heard that noise.

00:26:44.951 --> 00:26:48.867
MATT: You see Kiri's feathers fluffing up as she
does it. (growling)

00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:50.621
SAM: Can you do that again, Kiri?

00:26:50.621 --> 00:26:53.165
MATT: (growling)

00:26:53.165 --> 00:26:55.214
SAM: Have we ever heard this sound before?

00:26:55.214 --> 00:26:58.343
MATT: It's the sound of the crocodiles from the
battle before.

00:26:58.343 --> 00:27:04.705
LIAM: Frumpkin travels over to Kiri and starts
going (purring) as he nestles against Kiri.

00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:11.252
MATT: Kiri starts fluffing and loosely purring
back.

00:27:11.252 --> 00:27:15.304
MARK: Is that cat with you?

00:27:15.304 --> 00:27:17.642
LIAM: The cat is with me.

00:27:17.642 --> 00:27:21.649
MARK: Oh, cats don't like me. They tend to really
freak out.

00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:25.641
TRAVIS: Yes! I understand that completely. You and
I, we're going to be real close, I can feel.

00:27:25.641 --> 00:27:27.125
MARK: I think they can smell the dragon blood.

00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:28.208
TRAVIS: I know, they can tell.

00:27:28.208 --> 00:27:29.827
MARK: Are you a dragon as well?!

00:27:29.827 --> 00:27:32.565
TRAVIS: No. I'm allergic.

00:27:32.565 --> 00:27:34.650
LIAM: I take a step and a half away from Cali.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:39.832
LAURA: Cali, did you hear any howling in the
swamp, because we heard there were howling

00:27:39.832 --> 00:27:41.178
monsters?

00:27:41.178 --> 00:27:47.183
MATT: Nothing that was howling-esque,
necessarily, but you didn't travel too far into

00:27:47.183 --> 00:27:48.393
the swamp.

00:27:48.393 --> 00:27:52.269
MARK: No, I didn't really go that far deep in,
with the gators and some shadows moving around. I

00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:56.446
know a little magic, but I've never fought before,
so.

00:27:56.446 --> 00:27:58.272
SAM: You've never fought?

00:27:58.272 --> 00:28:08.323
MARK: No, I had a bit of a reclused upbringing. I
learned magic, I know a few spells, and I learned

00:28:08.323 --> 00:28:15.054
how to control it a bit. Draconic blood gives me
some magic, but I've never been in a real fight

00:28:15.054 --> 00:28:16.094
before.

00:28:16.094 --> 00:28:20.885
SAM: Caleb can teach you all about magic, he knows
all the spells and he's very wise.

00:28:20.885 --> 00:28:21.843
MARK: Really?

00:28:21.843 --> 00:28:22.645
SAM: Yes!

00:28:22.645 --> 00:28:23.508
MARK: Oh wow!

00:28:23.508 --> 00:28:26.236
TRAVIS: Although I don't think we're going to have
time for that. If you're going to join us, you're

00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:28.059
going to have to work for your food, you
understand?

00:28:28.059 --> 00:28:29.130
MARK: I do!

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.489
TRAVIS: My name's Fjord, by the way.

00:28:30.489 --> 00:28:32.063
MARK: Nice to meet you Fjord.

00:28:32.063 --> 00:28:32.946
MARISHA: Beau.

00:28:32.946 --> 00:28:33.888
MARK: Beau?

00:28:33.888 --> 00:28:37.822
LIAM: Caleb. Yeah.

00:28:37.822 --> 00:28:39.239
SAM: Bren.

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:40.476
MARK: Bren?

00:28:40.476 --> 00:28:42.474
LAURA: Jester Fancypants.

00:28:42.474 --> 00:28:44.892
MARK: That's a brilliant name.

00:28:44.892 --> 00:28:47.660
TALIESIN: Molly.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.653
ASHLEY: Yasha.

00:28:49.653 --> 00:28:52.090
MARK: I haven't spoken to you. You're very big.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.216
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, that's just me.

00:28:56.216 --> 00:28:58.665
MARK: I like your black and white hair, that's
cool.

00:28:58.665 --> 00:29:00.643
ASHLEY: Thanks.

00:29:00.643 --> 00:29:02.466
MARISHA: You're very excitable.

00:29:02.466 --> 00:29:04.323
MATT: (like Jester) "This is Kiri."

00:29:04.323 --> 00:29:05.704
MARK: Cali.

00:29:05.704 --> 00:29:12.366
ASHLEY: So can you shoot out fire out your nose,
and all that?

00:29:12.366 --> 00:29:15.447
MARK: Well, kind of.

00:29:15.447 --> 00:29:17.247
LAURA: Just the one, one nostril?

00:29:17.247 --> 00:29:26.076
MARK: I could try, yeah. It's mainly if I breathe,
it's more acid. But I can control some fire as well.

00:29:26.076 --> 00:29:29.543
MARISHA: Do you have one little wing back there,
too?

00:29:29.543 --> 00:29:34.101
MARK: No wings, just the tail and the claw.

00:29:34.101 --> 00:29:35.883
MARISHA: That would have been cool, though.

00:29:35.883 --> 00:29:39.057
MARK: The claw's kind of sharp, I learned to fight
with it a little bit.

00:29:39.057 --> 00:29:40.755
ASHLEY: Can I see it?

00:29:40.755 --> 00:29:45.810
MARK: Yeah, I'm just-- Is there anybody else
around in the tavern?

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:49.553
MATT: There's at this point, two other patrons,
but they're not really paying attention.

00:29:49.553 --> 00:29:54.308
MARK: I'll put my back to them, and then I'll move
up to Yasha. She takes her cloak off and brings

00:29:54.308 --> 00:29:55.658
out this scaled--

00:29:55.658 --> 00:30:00.596
MATT: "Jesus Christ! That's your arm?"

00:30:00.596 --> 00:30:01.901
MARK: Is that the--?

00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:03.130
MATT: Yeah, that's Febron.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.505
MARK: Yeah it is.

00:30:04.505 --> 00:30:06.823
MATT: "Don't get me wrong, I still think it's
pretty foxy."

00:30:06.823 --> 00:30:11.629
TALIESIN: That's somehow even creepier.

00:30:11.629 --> 00:30:16.115
LAURA: You know what, I appreciate that you're so
accepting of everything, Febron.

00:30:16.115 --> 00:30:17.254
MARK: It is quite nice.

00:30:17.254 --> 00:30:21.798
MATT: "Been around as long as I have, you live a
life of beggars can't be choosers."

00:30:21.798 --> 00:30:26.124
TALIESIN: And right back in the pit. Anyway.

00:30:26.124 --> 00:30:32.095
MARK: But yeah, I'm happy to help, and work, and
do what you need me to do. I just really need to

00:30:32.095 --> 00:30:34.197
get this item. I need to make sure it--

00:30:34.197 --> 00:30:40.360
TRAVIS: I understand. Unfortunately, my daughter
is very particular about shiny and expensive

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.657
things, so if this bowl has any worth, I'm afraid
we might need to be compensated for our troubles.

00:30:45.657 --> 00:30:48.214
Did you happen to bring any coin with you?

00:30:48.214 --> 00:30:55.699
MARK: Only a little. I could maybe trade you
something for it, but I'd like to keep it on me

00:30:55.699 --> 00:31:01.370
for now, if you don't mind. It's a small trinket.
It's got a little bit of magic, but it's just

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:08.071
that-- you can see on her human arm, it's a silver
bracelet with a charm token hanging off it with a

00:31:08.071 --> 00:31:09.318
green emerald.

00:31:09.318 --> 00:31:11.014
SAM: I love trinkets.

00:31:11.014 --> 00:31:15.650
MARK: It's an arcane focus, I'm told, but it has a
little magic to it.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.100
LAURA: Trinkets are pretty great.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.771
SAM: They are. They always have been.

00:31:18.771 --> 00:31:23.165
TRAVIS: We normally have a no stranger policy, but
we'll keep a close eye on you. If you get up to

00:31:23.165 --> 00:31:24.479
any tricksy business--

00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:27.552
MARK: I promise, no tricksy business from me.

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:32.177
TRAVIS: I hear you talking still. Yeah, Yasha and
Molly, they'll remove your head for you. You

00:31:32.177 --> 00:31:33.345
understand?

00:31:33.345 --> 00:31:35.847
TALIESIN: Very gently and politely, but yeah.

00:31:35.847 --> 00:31:42.425
ASHLEY: You know what? I really like your scales.
I would probably fashion a cool cover for my arm.

00:31:42.425 --> 00:31:43.908
LAURA: Yasha!

00:31:43.908 --> 00:31:48.382
ASHLEY: I'm not going to do it, I'm just saying
it's really cool. Full transparency.

00:31:48.382 --> 00:31:50.498
MARK: I'll be good. I promise.

MARISHA: We're not responsible for any injury or
death that you may sustain while traveling with

00:31:54.617 --> 00:31:57.420
us. Even if it is from a member of The Mighty
Nein.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.879
TRAVIS: Should we have her sign something? I mean,
should we have a release form?

00:32:00.879 --> 00:32:04.149
LAURA: I'll write up a release form really fast.

00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:05.584
SAM: Oh! Illustrated?

00:32:05.584 --> 00:32:06.877
LAURA: Yes!

00:32:06.877 --> 00:32:08.447
SAM: Illustrate all the things that could happen.

00:32:08.447 --> 00:32:13.821
LAURA: Arms being chopped off. An axe to the face.
I will illustrate being burned by fire.

00:32:13.821 --> 00:32:15.328
SAM: Castration.

00:32:15.328 --> 00:32:21.270
LAURA: Pulled apart by gators. Probably something
creepy and howling eating you as well.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:25.425
LIAM: This is probably stating the obvious, but if
you have not picked up on it yourself, we are kind

00:32:25.425 --> 00:32:27.043
of a pack of assholes.

00:32:27.043 --> 00:32:31.600
LAURA: I'm going to use the colored ink from my
mom to make it really gory.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.764
MARK: You're not trying to burn me. You're not
threatening to kill me because I'm cursed. Yeah,

00:32:36.764 --> 00:32:40.242
you all seem lovely, really. You're much better
than most people I have to deal with, to be

00:32:40.242 --> 00:32:41.287
honest.

00:32:41.287 --> 00:32:42.764
LAURA: Here you go. You can sign this.

00:32:42.764 --> 00:32:45.088
MARK: Okay! Sorry.

00:32:45.088 --> 00:32:57.156
(laughter)

00:32:57.156 --> 00:32:59.017
LAURA: All right, we have a deal.

00:32:59.017 --> 00:33:00.331
TRAVIS: Good, you're in.

00:33:00.331 --> 00:33:03.224
LAURA: Welcome to The Mighty Nein!

00:33:03.224 --> 00:33:05.764
MATT: (like Jester) "Welcome to The Mighty Nein!"

00:33:05.764 --> 00:33:07.031
MARK: This bird is adorable!

00:33:07.031 --> 00:33:11.249
MARISHA: Oh shit there's not-- no, we're not
ironic any more!

00:33:11.249 --> 00:33:15.384
TRAVIS: Well, we'll see how we are at the end of
the day. Bet that'll fix itself.

00:33:15.384 --> 00:33:16.774
MARISHA: Oh, that's true.

00:33:16.774 --> 00:33:21.243
LIAM: Yeah, we are. Because when we write the name
down, it's actually the Zemnian word for no. So

00:33:21.243 --> 00:33:22.525
even if there's nine people, then--

00:33:22.525 --> 00:33:23.624
TRAVIS: You're overthinking it Caleb.

00:33:23.624 --> 00:33:24.992
MARISHA: It's a double entendre.

00:33:24.992 --> 00:33:27.206
LAURA and TALIESIN: Let's go!

00:33:27.206 --> 00:33:29.507
ASHLEY: Wait, we haven't eaten-- oh yes, we have.
Sorry.

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:32.559
LAURA: Lots of pocket bacon.

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:35.901
TALIESIN: We ordered coffee? We're still waiting
on coffee? Is there going to be a desert? Was

00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:46.303
there a desert menu? Can I get a container? Eggs
never keep, anyway.

00:33:46.303 --> 00:33:53.246
MATT: You gather your things, finish off the
remainder of your lackluster breakfast. At this

00:33:53.246 --> 00:34:01.930
point now, the morning air is chilled, though
there is still humidity that permeates the swamp

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:09.141
vicinity. You hear the bugs beginning to grow
louder with the distant cicada/cricket sounds in

00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:14.857
the distance echoing through the swamp. There is a
low fog that is fairly prominent this early in the

00:34:14.857 --> 00:34:23.045
morning. You can see about 15 or 20 feet beyond
the barrier of the outer swamp before the moisture

00:34:23.045 --> 00:34:28.320
begins to pick up. You see just the shaded trunks
of trees beyond that for another 60 or so feet

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.080
before it becomes completely obscured by fog.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.307
LAURA: Whoa, it's creepy!

00:34:34.307 --> 00:34:36.190
TALIESIN: Does it always do that?

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:43.238
MATT: "This time of year it does. It's just
getting close to winter."

00:34:43.238 --> 00:34:46.623
MARISHA: Do we have basically zero visibility?

00:34:46.623 --> 00:34:54.763
MATT: Not zero visibility. You have traveling
about 30 feet of general visibility, and then it

00:34:54.763 --> 00:34:59.429
begins to get a little bit beyond that. At this
point Febron chimes in. "Don't worry, it burns off

00:34:59.429 --> 00:35:01.246
"a bit as the day goes on."

00:35:01.246 --> 00:35:08.009
TRAVIS: Febron, any suggestions whether to move
through the muck fine land or through the trees?

00:35:08.009 --> 00:35:12.290
MATT: "I mean, we're going to go through all of
it, really, but we're going to head for the

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.154
"outside of the Ounterloch."

00:35:14.154 --> 00:35:15.324
TRAVIS: The where?

00:35:15.324 --> 00:35:17.147
MATT: "The Ounterloch."

00:35:17.147 --> 00:35:19.705
MARISHA: Ounterloch.

00:35:19.705 --> 00:35:21.143
LIAM: Under the lake?

00:35:21.143 --> 00:35:25.281
MATT: "We're heading towards the lake. We're going
to try and make our way around the outskirts of

00:35:25.281 --> 00:35:29.457
"it, but we're going to have to coast through the
swamp to get there. That way we're not trudging

00:35:29.457 --> 00:35:32.727
"through the main central area too much."

00:35:32.727 --> 00:35:35.801
SAM: Are we taking the cart? Or just going on
foot?

00:35:35.801 --> 00:35:37.650
MATT: "Oh I wouldn't recommend taking that with
us, no."

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.726
TRAVIS: We'll leave it, it'll be fine, daughter.

00:35:40.726 --> 00:35:48.665
SAM: Sure, Papa. May I have my allowance now?

00:35:48.665 --> 00:35:54.901
TRAVIS: No. You've been naughty. No.

00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:56.163
ASHLEY: Nott-y.

00:35:56.163 --> 00:35:57.504
MARK: He's a very stern dad.

00:35:57.504 --> 00:35:58.764
SAM: He is, but fair.

00:35:58.764 --> 00:36:07.935
MATT: As you guys are plotting a means out there,
Kiri has the dagger out and is practicing little

00:36:07.935 --> 00:36:09.297
swings excitedly.

00:36:09.297 --> 00:36:11.674
LAURA: Yeah! Kill all of it. Kill the fog, Kiri.

00:36:11.674 --> 00:36:16.718
MATT: Then she goes charging towards the fog.

00:36:16.718 --> 00:36:18.749
TRAVIS: And gets eaten.

00:36:18.749 --> 00:36:23.001
MARISHA: Aww. Damn it!

00:36:23.001 --> 00:36:24.980
MATT: It's The Mist.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:31.644
TRAVIS: Jester's regret.

00:36:31.644 --> 00:36:36.015
LAURA: I have to live with this for the rest of my
life.

00:36:36.015 --> 00:36:40.096
MATT: Kiri has run past the barrier of The Puddles
on the north side of the city and is now swinging

00:36:40.096 --> 00:36:41.247
wildly into the fog.

00:36:41.247 --> 00:36:42.701
LAURA: Oh shit! Kiri, come back, Kiri.

00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:45.403
MATT, MARISHA, and ASHLEY: (singing) Kiri come
back!

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:53.679
MATT: Runs back, feet leaving a trail behind as
she's stepping through two to three inches of

00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:57.012
swamp water across this district. (chirping)

00:36:57.012 --> 00:37:01.434
LAURA: You have to be careful. There's lots of
creatures around that could hurt you, you know.

00:37:01.434 --> 00:37:03.452
MATT: "There's lots of creatures around that could
hurt you."

00:37:03.452 --> 00:37:06.525
LIAM: You always want to stick together. You never
want to split the party.

00:37:06.525 --> 00:37:09.531
ASHLEY: Yeah, stay close. Stay close to us.

00:37:09.531 --> 00:37:13.392
MATT: She gets right behind Yasha and sticks right
to her back with the dagger out on the opposite side

00:37:13.392 --> 00:37:14.702
going--

00:37:14.702 --> 00:37:19.888
LAURA: We should really give her like a sheath or
something to put that knife away, Fjord.

00:37:19.888 --> 00:37:26.438
TRAVIS: I think you tell kids to run with
scissors, she'll be fine. Can we check to make

00:37:26.438 --> 00:37:28.805
sure nobody's following us as we're heading out?

00:37:28.805 --> 00:37:30.532
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:37:30.532 --> 00:37:35.445
TRAVIS: Plus four, 16.

00:37:35.445 --> 00:37:42.375
MATT: You take a moment to scout the vicinity. At
this point in the morning, it's maybe about nine

00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:47.523
o'clock or so judging by where you can see the
source of sunlight in the somewhat clouded sky.

00:37:47.523 --> 00:37:53.956
Glancing around the city, not a lot of folks are
moving. It seems like the nature of the swamp town

00:37:53.956 --> 00:37:58.726
is a little bit of a slower pace of living by the
nature of the location. The few folks that are

00:37:58.726 --> 00:38:04.670
wandering around the streets are slowly getting to
their daily chores and business. No one seems to

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:08.593
be particularly interested. A few folks look over
because you are a gathered motley crew on the edge

00:38:08.593 --> 00:38:12.489
of town, but there's no one who seems to be very
focused in what's going on.

00:38:12.489 --> 00:38:18.196
MARISHA: We're the best-looking people in this
town, and that's saying something.

00:38:18.196 --> 00:38:28.138
LIAM: This group is very inclined-- we're very
skilled in arcane things. What is your specialty?

00:38:28.138 --> 00:38:35.306
MARK: Oh, well. You know how some people learn
magic from books and some people get magic from

00:38:35.306 --> 00:38:36.911
gods and stuff, right?

00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:38.921
LIAM: Gods and stuff, ja, okay.

00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:46.746
MARK: My magic comes from just me? The draconic
blood, I'm told, has magical essences to it.

00:38:46.746 --> 00:38:50.203
LIAM: Yes. Cool. What can you do with it?

00:38:50.203 --> 00:38:57.171
MARK: Well, I don't know if I should-- It's a lot
of fire and acid, mainly. That seems to be related

00:38:57.171 --> 00:38:59.211
to the type of dragon I'm from.

00:38:59.211 --> 00:39:00.967
LIAM: Ja, effective.

00:39:00.967 --> 00:39:09.085
MARK: I can conjure fire. I can make a lot of
fire. Varying of degrees of fire, really, and acid.

00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:12.334
LIAM: Do you have maybe one B-side besides the
fire?

00:39:12.334 --> 00:39:21.764
MARK: Besides fire and acid, a little bit of poi--
I can drain life force and invigorate myself a

00:39:21.764 --> 00:39:22.925
little bit.

00:39:22.925 --> 00:39:23.892
LIAM: Okay.

00:39:23.892 --> 00:39:25.119
MARISHA: Say "fire" one more time.

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:26.047
MARK: Fire.

00:39:26.047 --> 00:39:27.014
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:39:27.014 --> 00:39:30.604
MATT: "Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire." (chirping)

00:39:30.604 --> 00:39:33.377
MARK: What kind of magic do you specialize in, Mr.
Caleb?

00:39:33.377 --> 00:39:39.372
MATT: "Wrapped around his weenie."

00:39:39.372 --> 00:39:42.375
TRAVIS: Good pull!

00:39:42.375 --> 00:39:46.676
MARK: You have magic with that? Is that like an
implement or something?

00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:49.302
TRAVIS: Deep pull already! That was like 40
minutes ago!

00:39:49.302 --> 00:39:54.412
MARK: You said that crows are really smart, so I'm
guessing she knows-- what?

00:39:54.412 --> 00:40:02.205
LIAM: There's so much quicksand in this swamp. I'm
feeling trapped. I feel like we have a little bit

00:40:02.205 --> 00:40:04.046
of overlap, you know. I'm able to--

00:40:04.046 --> 00:40:05.788
LAURA: He has lots of fire.

00:40:05.788 --> 00:40:08.894
MARK: Really? You don't have any dragon blood in
you, do you?

00:40:08.894 --> 00:40:10.464
LIAM: Nein.

00:40:10.464 --> 00:40:11.772
MARK: Oh, that's good.

00:40:11.772 --> 00:40:13.524
TALIESIN and SAM: Nine dragons.

00:40:13.524 --> 00:40:20.139
MARK: You meant the Zemnian "nein." Not the
number.

00:40:20.139 --> 00:40:22.261
LIAM: Step off, Tiamat.

00:40:22.261 --> 00:40:27.545
TALIESIN: Well done. That's a good joke.

00:40:27.545 --> 00:40:33.078
MATT: "So we good to go? Ready to move? The longer
we take the more risk we run of getting there

00:40:33.078 --> 00:40:36.546
"about nighttime, and I would feel a bit nervous
about that to be honest."

00:40:36.546 --> 00:40:39.524
TRAVIS: No please, lead on. We're quite anxious to
get there.

00:40:39.524 --> 00:40:41.129
MATT: "Okay, so, who's leading?"

00:40:41.129 --> 00:40:42.895
LAURA and MARISHA: You are.

00:40:42.895 --> 00:40:44.985
MATT: "I'm pointing the direction, no, but I'm not
standing at the front.

00:40:44.985 --> 00:40:47.199
MARISHA: For 100 gold, I think you will.

00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:52.449
MATT: "100 gold, I'm pointing the direction, but
look at me, I'm not going to defend you well."

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:53.934
ASHLEY: Yeah, but we'll be right behind you.

00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:56.260
MATT: "Yeah, but if I die first, you're going to
be lost in this swamp!"

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.515
SAM: He's only got one eye, he can't possibly see
what's going on.

00:41:00.515 --> 00:41:02.105
TRAVIS: Fine, I'll take the lead, who wants to
join me?

00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:03.237
MARISHA: I'll join you.

00:41:03.237 --> 00:41:04.196
LAURA: I will.

00:41:04.196 --> 00:41:05.898
TRAVIS: Thank you both, don't fight.

00:41:05.898 --> 00:41:07.143
MARISHA: If you want to like--

00:41:07.143 --> 00:41:09.644
LAURA: It's fine, Beau.

00:41:09.644 --> 00:41:11.418
MARISHA: Look, I'm trying to wingman you here
right now.

00:41:11.418 --> 00:41:13.105
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

00:41:13.105 --> 00:41:14.374
ASHLEY: I'll take the back.

00:41:14.374 --> 00:41:15.652
TALIESIN: I'll also go in the back.

00:41:15.652 --> 00:41:20.134
MARK: Yeah, I can shoot things at range or close
up if need be.

00:41:20.134 --> 00:41:22.776
LIAM: If need be, but you know. Wait for the need
to be.

00:41:22.776 --> 00:41:23.918
MARK: Yeah.

00:41:23.918 --> 00:41:24.996
MATT: Nott, where are you?

00:41:24.996 --> 00:41:32.716
SAM: I'm going to use my ring of water walking,
and I'm going to be the same level as Beau except

00:41:32.716 --> 00:41:37.718
30 feet to the right. Just as a flanking--

00:41:37.718 --> 00:41:41.768
LAURA: I'm going to carry Kiri on my shoulders.

00:41:41.768 --> 00:41:43.226
MATT: Kiri on your shoulders?

00:41:43.226 --> 00:41:45.309
LAURA: Yeah, so that she doesn't have to walk
through the muck.

00:41:45.309 --> 00:41:51.494
MATT: There's Kiri. She's up there with the two
feathered arms flopped over and (chirping) looking

00:41:51.494 --> 00:41:52.402
around.

00:41:52.402 --> 00:41:53.897
ASHLEY: Holding onto your head like a kid.

00:41:53.897 --> 00:41:55.431
TALIESIN: Just feathers in your face.

00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:57.557
LIAM: I like where we are positioned, what do you
think?

00:41:57.557 --> 00:42:03.016
MARK: I'll go wherever you need me to. Mr. Fjord
said that I'm to do whatever so I'll go wherever.

00:42:03.016 --> 00:42:05.995
LAURA: How does she know there's a J in your name
really?

00:42:05.995 --> 00:42:09.133
TRAVIS: I honestly don't have an answer for that.

00:42:09.133 --> 00:42:13.658
MARK: I was pretty sure you said "Fjord," but
okay.

00:42:13.658 --> 00:42:16.451
SAM: We're all pretty sure about that.

00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:19.715
TRAVIS: You said it right, it's "Ford."

00:42:19.715 --> 00:42:21.385
MARK: Thanks, "Mr. Ford."

00:42:21.385 --> 00:42:24.745
SAM: It's "Mee-ster Ford."

00:42:24.745 --> 00:42:28.142
MARK: "Mee-ster Ford." All right, sure.

00:42:28.142 --> 00:42:29.948
MATT: (like Cali) "Mee-ster Ford."

00:42:29.948 --> 00:42:33.775
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus, Kiri. All right, let's go.

00:42:33.775 --> 00:42:38.138
MATT: At this point Febron's like, "All right so
looking out this direction, this time of day--

00:42:38.138 --> 00:42:40.650
"that way! Lead on, big boy."

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.990
TRAVIS: All right. You're actually going to be
scouting, right?

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:45.541
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:45.541 --> 00:42:52.194
MATT: As you guys begin to step past the outskirts
of The Puddles, your feet begin to sink thicker

00:42:52.194 --> 00:42:56.927
and thicker into the swamp floor as you further
and further step away from this little bastion of

00:42:56.927 --> 00:43:05.609
civilization. With each progressive footstep you
can see the waves ripple past and then hit patches

00:43:05.609 --> 00:43:12.448
of thick elevated vegetation that's growing and
rotting in small clusters simultaneously. The tree

00:43:12.448 --> 00:43:17.664
trunks that are faded shadows begin to come into
view and you begin to see these twisted, gnarled

00:43:17.664 --> 00:43:24.629
trees covered in vines that dangle down from these
high boughs that barely cluster out sections of

00:43:24.629 --> 00:43:30.443
sunlight, and you pass out underneath those areas
where bits of cloud begin to break through.

00:43:30.443 --> 00:43:32.371
LIAM: It was a joke.

00:43:32.371 --> 00:43:33.559
MATT: Ah, gotcha

00:43:33.559 --> 00:43:35.149
LIAM: I said, "Hi, Beaus."

00:43:35.149 --> 00:43:36.314
MATT: Ah, boughs.

00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:38.244
LIAM: I know. But I said "Hi, Beaus."

00:43:38.244 --> 00:43:42.236
TRAVIS: Three out of five.

00:43:42.236 --> 00:43:55.635
MATT: Yeah, it's fine. In pushing this forward and
guiding the path, I'm going to have Febron and

00:43:55.635 --> 00:43:59.497
whoever is keeping watch on the exterior to both
make survival checks.

00:43:59.497 --> 00:44:01.897
MARISHA: What do you mean on the exterior?

00:44:01.897 --> 00:44:03.374
SAM: I'm keeping watch on the right.

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:05.370
MARISHA: I'm keeping watch up front.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:07.671
ASHLEY: I'm looking on the back.

00:44:07.671 --> 00:44:09.097
LIAM: The gators come from the left.

00:44:09.097 --> 00:44:13.458
MATT: Right. Well this isn't a perception check,
this is to make their way through the swamp to

00:44:13.458 --> 00:44:16.914
keep track of what's ahead, so I'm having Febron
and one of you take point on that.

00:44:16.914 --> 00:44:18.018
TRAVIS: Beau.

00:44:18.018 --> 00:44:20.133
MARISHA: What kind of a check is this?

00:44:20.133 --> 00:44:20.992
LIAM: Survival.

00:44:20.992 --> 00:44:22.143
MATT: This is a survival check.

00:44:22.143 --> 00:44:29.704
MARISHA: Okay. Oh, I thought it was actually
higher when I first looked at it. 17.

00:44:29.704 --> 00:44:35.352
MATT: Actually, you both rolled pretty high. Over
the next two hours or so, you guys manage to keep

00:44:35.352 --> 00:44:44.547
for the most part above any of the deeper recesses
of marsh water. Leaping from cluster of tree base

00:44:44.547 --> 00:44:50.704
and sections of ground that are mostly above the
water line, it manages to go through without much

00:44:50.704 --> 00:44:58.137
of an issue. The fog does slowly begin to burn off
as the hours progress, but it's still present. You

00:44:58.137 --> 00:45:03.308
gather probably about the time you arrived at the
end of day yesterday to the exterior of the

00:45:03.308 --> 00:45:06.523
Labenda Swamp, there was just a faint bit of fog
at the ground. It will be a number of hours before

00:45:06.523 --> 00:45:12.041
you even reach that point, but it is progressing
towards a more visible space. These two hours you

00:45:12.041 --> 00:45:16.361
guys continue forward, being mindful and watching
around. Those who are keeping watch, I need both

00:45:16.361 --> 00:45:20.821
of you to make perception checks or one of you
make it with advantage, your choice.

00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:23.921
MARISHA: It's me and who?

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.531
MATT: Whoever else is keeping a watch. You want to
make it, Nott?

00:45:25.531 --> 00:45:26.296
SAM: Yeah.

00:45:26.296 --> 00:45:27.178
MATT: Go for it.

00:45:27.178 --> 00:45:28.395
MARISHA: Do you want to make it with advantage or
separate?

00:45:28.395 --> 00:45:29.946
SAM: Nah. One.

00:45:29.946 --> 00:45:35.054
MARISHA: It's not great for me either. Six.

00:45:35.054 --> 00:45:37.355
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise.

00:45:37.355 --> 00:45:40.622
SAM: Clear on the right!

00:45:40.622 --> 00:45:42.373
MARISHA: Clear on the front!

00:45:42.373 --> 00:45:45.641
TRAVIS: Right, front--

00:45:45.641 --> 00:45:51.799
MARISHA: (shouting) Clear on the left? Man, which
way am I looking?

00:45:51.799 --> 00:45:53.727
SAM: I don't know.

00:45:53.727 --> 00:45:56.287
TRAVIS: It's really reassuring when there's a
question mark on the end of your statement.

00:45:56.287 --> 00:45:59.841
LIAM: This is generally how it goes.

00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:07.255
MATT: Febron at this point's still looking. He
says, "Wait, hold on a second." He starts doing a

00:46:07.255 --> 00:46:10.756
little circle in the area, checking out some of
the recent trees, looking at the sun in the sky

00:46:10.756 --> 00:46:15.458
and he's like, "Yeah. I feel like we're going the
right way."

00:46:15.458 --> 00:46:24.530
TALIESIN: Wait, just to be clear: Your job-- your
only job was to walk to a building and back for

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.351
god knows how many years and you think we're
going the right way?

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:29.535
MATT: "Yeah, we don't usually leave this early in
the morning."

00:46:29.535 --> 00:46:31.027
TRAVIS: Are you still drunk?

00:46:31.027 --> 00:46:32.482
MATT: (noncommittal grunt)

00:46:32.482 --> 00:46:33.812
TALIESIN: Do you need to be drunk?

00:46:33.812 --> 00:46:35.014
MATT: "Yeah."

00:46:35.014 --> 00:46:36.872
LIAM and ASHLEY: Nott.

00:46:36.872 --> 00:46:37.905
SAM: What?

00:46:37.905 --> 00:46:42.557
LIAM: Not a problem. Bren, would you help our
friend out?

00:46:42.557 --> 00:46:45.783
SAM: Oh. Yes, it's me, Bren. Yeah, I'll be right
over.

00:46:45.783 --> 00:46:51.424
MARK: She's oblivious, completely lost. She's
looking around like--

00:46:51.424 --> 00:46:58.365
SAM: Febron, do you have any cups? I don't want
you to--

00:46:58.365 --> 00:47:03.530
MATT: He pulls out a half-filled wineskin, opens
it up, pours the water out.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:08.438
SAM: Have some booze. I'll fill it to the brim.

00:47:08.438 --> 00:47:13.280
MATT: He looks curiously at the flask and the
amount of liquid you poured in there.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.607
SAM: Cheers.

00:47:15.607 --> 00:47:22.144
MATT: "Cheers indeed. Tiny girl." He watches as
you drink the alcohol and is confused. Gets a

00:47:22.144 --> 00:47:23.999
closer look at you at this point and he goes--

00:47:23.999 --> 00:47:25.782
TALIESIN: Now is not the time to start making
judgments, sir.

00:47:25.782 --> 00:47:27.985
MATT: "Right."

00:47:27.985 --> 00:47:33.555
TALIESIN: Does that clear your memory?

00:47:33.555 --> 00:47:37.553
MATT: "Aye. It's this way." Make another survival
check.

00:47:37.553 --> 00:47:41.619
MARK: Mr. Fjord, you're very liberal with your
parenting.

00:47:41.619 --> 00:47:44.560
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Sunny.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.226
LAURA: It's just milk.

00:47:46.226 --> 00:47:47.874
MARK: Oh. That makes sense.

00:47:47.874 --> 00:47:50.036
MARISHA: Man, that's really frustrating. Seven.

00:47:50.036 --> 00:47:51.205
TALIESIN: Did you both roll?

00:47:51.205 --> 00:47:52.388
MARISHA: Huh?

00:47:52.388 --> 00:47:54.608
MATT: Well, it was Febron and Beau.

00:47:54.608 --> 00:47:58.372
MARISHA: Seven. Not good. I keep getting so
close.

00:47:58.372 --> 00:48:01.287
TALIESIN: Do we not get advantage?

00:48:01.287 --> 00:48:06.084
MATT: Well, this one they're doing it
individually, because you have somebody outside

00:48:06.084 --> 00:48:15.462
of-- Along the path as you guys are progressing
for the next hour or so, Febron and Beau are

00:48:15.462 --> 00:48:21.826
keeping pace on this. Keeping watch, moving
forward, you step through some of the soggier

00:48:21.826 --> 00:48:26.622
areas of the swamp and your foot gets stuck a bit
and it's starting to get a little more difficult

00:48:26.622 --> 00:48:30.866
to traverse. Febron's like, "It's just a few more
hours and we'll make our way to the outskirts of

00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:34.477
"the lake. It'll be a lot easier then, trust me.
It'll be fine."

00:48:34.477 --> 00:48:36.347
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:48:36.347 --> 00:48:37.477
MARK: Sounds great.

00:48:37.477 --> 00:48:42.673
MATT: At this point, Fjord, as you are stepping
near the front you come around the corner and

00:48:42.673 --> 00:48:52.632
without notice there's this strange sound. This
(airy puff) and there's a cloud of pollen-like

00:48:52.632 --> 00:48:59.353
spores in the air right where you are. I need you
to make a wisdom saving throw, please.

00:48:59.353 --> 00:49:01.090
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh no.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.539
SAM: He's very wise, he'll be fine.

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:04.305
TRAVIS: Oh jeez.

00:49:04.305 --> 00:49:07.309
MARK: That's always a good sign.

00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:08.887
TRAVIS: 14.

00:49:08.887 --> 00:49:16.430
MATT: You manage to pull back, coughing a bit, and
your head goes dazed for a moment, but you manage

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:21.141
to shrug it off. You guys look ahead and beyond
the area where Fjord was pushing, around one of the

00:49:21.141 --> 00:49:26.179
trees you can see this large, 30-foot wide cloud
of yellowish pollen that went (airy puff) and

00:49:26.179 --> 00:49:29.629
slowly settles into the swamp area.

00:49:29.629 --> 00:49:30.860
MARK: Blimey.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.987
TRAVIS: Can we see a source where it came from? A
plant or a--

00:49:34.987 --> 00:49:38.546
MATT: There's a whole mess of twisted vines and
plant matter in the center of the space. Where it

00:49:38.546 --> 00:49:45.655
seemed to emit from, the center, though, you do
see one large fern-type plant that's left open and

00:49:45.655 --> 00:49:49.750
three or four large leaves that are spread
outward.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:52.403
TRAVIS: I think that doesn't look very
hospitable.

00:49:52.403 --> 00:49:53.844
MARISHA: Febron.

00:49:53.844 --> 00:49:55.190
LAURA: We should avoid those, huh?

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.655
MARISHA: Yeah. Is this a thing that happens, I'm
assuming?

00:49:58.655 --> 00:50:05.078
MATT: "I haven't actually seen this close to one
of them. I usually avoid them. So let's avoid it, eh?"

00:50:05.078 --> 00:50:08.156
MARK: Hello, Mr. Fjord?

00:50:08.156 --> 00:50:09.115
TRAVIS: Yeah?

00:50:09.115 --> 00:50:12.075
MARK: I don't know if this is-- do you want me to
burn it all away?

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:15.349
TRAVIS: Cali, that is a very good idea.

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:18.626
MARK: Like that area, right? Is that where it came
from?

00:50:18.626 --> 00:50:21.006
TRAVIS: I mean, hoping the pollen's not flammable,
but sure try it.

00:50:21.006 --> 00:50:22.808
MARK: Is it flammable, Mr. Creepy Pervert?

00:50:22.808 --> 00:50:25.811
MATT: "First off, I resent that."

00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:26.733
MARK: Do you?

00:50:26.733 --> 00:50:28.280
MATT: "No."

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.474
TALIESIN: I think the "Mr." was pretty respectable, all
things considered.

00:50:32.507 --> 00:50:37.655
MATT: "I'll take that. I mean, I figure it's
probably in the way, burn it if you can. I don't

00:50:37.655 --> 00:50:38.656
"trust it."

00:50:38.656 --> 00:50:40.321
MARK: How wide radius is this area?

00:50:40.321 --> 00:50:47.546
MATT: This vicinity is about 30 feet around this
particular plant in the center that's lying open,

00:50:47.546 --> 00:50:49.066
face to the sky.

00:50:49.066 --> 00:50:50.541
MARK: 20-foot radius would--

00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:52.452
MATT: It would encompass the plant, definitely.

00:50:52.452 --> 00:51:03.147
MARK: Fireball. The dragon claw comes out, and
this green flame magic coalesces. She flicks out

00:51:03.147 --> 00:51:07.442
this green orb that fires down, and when it hits
it detonates.

00:51:07.442 --> 00:51:08.589
LAURA: Wow!

00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:13.068
MATT: It emits this large blast of orangish-red
fire that burns in the area. Go ahead and roll

00:51:13.068 --> 00:51:14.519
damage.

00:51:14.519 --> 00:51:17.506
MARK: Can I have a d6 from somebody? I need six
more.

00:51:17.506 --> 00:51:18.960
MARISHA: There's three.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.331
TALIESIN: Feel free to dive through the bag for
anything you need.

00:51:22.331 --> 00:51:24.670
LAURA: Dang it, I'm trying to get to my bag to
help you, but--

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:26.848
MATT: She's filled with a baby.

00:51:26.848 --> 00:51:29.725
LIAM: Baby's in the way. Get used to it.

00:51:29.725 --> 00:51:35.124
LAURA: I can't bend. Whoa.

00:51:35.143 --> 00:51:36.463
MARK: I'm taking that, it's a six.

00:51:36.463 --> 00:51:37.639
LAURA: Yes.

00:51:37.639 --> 00:51:39.657
SAM: He's a high roller.

00:51:39.657 --> 00:51:41.568
MATT and MARISHA: Ooh.

00:51:41.568 --> 00:51:46.827
MARK: That's very good. That's going to be 28
points.

00:51:46.827 --> 00:51:52.693
MATT: 28 points of fire damage. This explosion
immediately evaporates the fog in the area, and a

00:51:52.693 --> 00:51:57.835
large part of the ground now is dried off. You see
this mist or steam (hiss) out of where the

00:51:57.835 --> 00:52:01.786
detonation happened. The plant in the center,
which is now more visible, you can see snap shut.

00:52:01.786 --> 00:52:09.536
This giant three, four part maw closes in the
space with these plant-like teeth. It's still

00:52:09.536 --> 00:52:16.290
there, writhing in pain from the explosion. It
laxes open a bit and begins to shift in your

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:20.253
direction. It looks hurt, but still alive.

00:52:20.253 --> 00:52:21.720
TRAVIS: Caleb.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.759
MARISHA: It moves.

LAURA: Sacred Flame.

00:52:23.649 --> 00:52:24.517
LIAM: Fire Bolt.

00:52:24.517 --> 00:52:30.097
MATT: All right, Fire Bolt, Sacred Flame, that's
cocked. That's a 15.

00:52:30.097 --> 00:52:32.077
LAURA: Dex save.

00:52:32.077 --> 00:52:33.974
MATT: 15, yeah, so no Sacred Flame but--

00:52:33.974 --> 00:52:35.316
LIAM: 17 for Fire Bolt.

00:52:35.316 --> 00:52:36.636
MATT: 17 hits, roll damage.

00:52:36.636 --> 00:52:38.724
LIAM: Okay. That is not that much, actually.

00:52:38.724 --> 00:52:42.505
LAURA: That was a dex check, yes?

00:52:42.505 --> 00:52:46.999
MATT: Yes. Or no-- yeah. For Sacred Flame, yeah.

00:52:46.999 --> 00:52:48.254
LIAM: That is a 12.

00:52:48.254 --> 00:52:49.261
MATT: 12?

00:52:49.261 --> 00:52:50.051
LIAM: Yes.

00:52:50.051 --> 00:52:56.425
MATT: 12 points of damage. As you slam it with the
Fire Bolt, it (shrieks) and keeps moving forward,

00:52:56.425 --> 00:52:57.334
but it's hurt.

00:52:57.334 --> 00:52:58.455
LAURA: Toll the Dead!

00:52:58.455 --> 00:53:00.357
MATT: Rolled another 15.

00:53:00.357 --> 00:53:01.717
LAURA: Damn it.

00:53:01.717 --> 00:53:05.616
LIAM: If you give me six second increments, I'm
just going to go (releasing spells).

00:53:05.616 --> 00:53:07.819
MARK: When it's within 60 feet, I can Acid Splash
it as well.

00:53:07.819 --> 00:53:09.419
TALIESIN: Just for fun, (Infernal) stay down.

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:11.678
SAM: Jesus.

00:53:11.678 --> 00:53:13.932
MATT: 16. Sorry.

00:53:13.932 --> 00:53:16.944
TALIESIN: Some days you can't get rid of a bomb.

00:53:16.944 --> 00:53:23.595
TRAVIS: I'll give it a whirl. I'll reach up near
my eye, and you see this little arc of energy pop

00:53:23.595 --> 00:53:27.035
out from my eye towards my hand. I'll throw it
forward and cast Witch Bolt.

00:53:27.035 --> 00:53:28.331
SAM: Witch Bolt.

00:53:28.331 --> 00:53:29.711
LAURA and ASHLEY: Ooh.

00:53:29.711 --> 00:53:31.596
LIAM: Which bolt do you cast?

00:53:31.596 --> 00:53:38.441
MATT: You guys are all preparing your various
cantrips and spells against it. It begins lurching

00:53:38.441 --> 00:53:43.403
forward. You can see the charred edges of this
large vegetable plant. Then Fjord steps forward

00:53:43.403 --> 00:53:49.450
sending this arc of darker, gray-green energy that
strikes into it. Roll damage-- roll to hit first.

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:57.237
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you, yeah. Ten plus six, 16.

00:53:57.237 --> 00:53:58.730
MATT: 16 hits.

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:01.649
TRAVIS: Okay, great. This is overkill, it's 3d12.

00:54:01.649 --> 00:54:03.060
SAM: Oh shit.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.039
TRAVIS: That's nine--

00:54:06.039 --> 00:54:07.958
MARISHA: Wow!

00:54:07.958 --> 00:54:09.613
LIAM: Good rolls!

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:14.118
TRAVIS: 27 points of damage.

00:54:14.118 --> 00:54:23.856
MATT: As it strikes this large, trap-like plant,
it hits the center of it. It bubbles up for a

00:54:23.856 --> 00:54:30.899
second, the green and red matter of the interior
swells and then pops. Like a horrible flesh-filled

00:54:30.899 --> 00:54:34.808
water balloon spatters across various areas. You
guys have to take a step back and it glides

00:54:34.808 --> 00:54:36.951
against your knees and thighs a bit.

00:54:36.951 --> 00:54:40.778
MARK: Can I use Shape Water to keep it out of my
way? My cantrip just (disgusted groan).

00:54:40.778 --> 00:54:46.558
MATT: It just manages to avoid you. But it lies
now, decimated and sinking slowly into the swamp

00:54:46.558 --> 00:54:47.515
water.

00:54:47.515 --> 00:54:50.469
MARK: Oh, sorry. I thought I'd kill it the first
time. I'm sorry you had to do that.

00:54:50.469 --> 00:54:54.079
TRAVIS: No, it was a really encouraging display. I
was not expecting it to be so durable.

00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:55.959
MARK: Yeah, me neither. I thought it was just a
plant.

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:58.301
LAURA: We should really avoid those in the future,
huh?

00:54:58.301 --> 00:55:03.931
LIAM: Well that's one in an entire swamp of
vegetation. So we should be good now.

00:55:03.931 --> 00:55:05.892
SAM: How's it going over there, guys?

00:55:05.892 --> 00:55:07.936
MARK: No, there's going to be loads of plants, Mr.
Caleb.

00:55:07.936 --> 00:55:09.833
TALIESIN: Anything on the right?

00:55:09.833 --> 00:55:10.994
LIAM: That is correct.

00:55:10.994 --> 00:55:12.156
SAM: Nope, all clear!

00:55:12.156 --> 00:55:13.290
MARISHA: Anything on the left?

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.398
TALIESIN: Right.

00:55:14.398 --> 00:55:17.693
MARISHA: No, I'm asking for anything on the left.

00:55:17.693 --> 00:55:19.205
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:55:19.205 --> 00:55:20.174
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:55:20.174 --> 00:55:21.379
TALIESIN: Is there somebody on the left?

00:55:21.379 --> 00:55:23.714
TRAVIS: Not anymore with these rolls.

00:55:23.714 --> 00:55:24.893
MARISHA: Nine.

00:55:24.893 --> 00:55:26.053
MATT: Who else wants to make a perception check?

00:55:26.053 --> 00:55:27.080
LAURA: I would.

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.421
MARISHA: I roll obnoxiously bad.

00:55:28.421 --> 00:55:29.945
SAM: Yeah.

00:55:29.945 --> 00:55:31.100
TALIESIN: Whoa.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.458
LAURA: Woo-hoo, 13!

00:55:34.458 --> 00:55:46.206
MATT: 13? Okay. A brief breeze blows through the
swamp as you guys move on from this positioning.

00:55:46.206 --> 00:55:52.595
You hear a very faint hiss through the distant
branches of the trees, singing in unison, as bits

00:55:52.595 --> 00:55:57.881
of leaves and vines clatter against themselves
from the shift. But you manage to catch a sound

00:55:57.881 --> 00:56:08.061
upon the wind that is unfamiliar to the rest of the
natural breeze. It's like a chime. Like a wooden

00:56:08.061 --> 00:56:10.282
chime (dull thunks).

00:56:10.282 --> 00:56:13.792
LAURA: (whispering) I hear something.

00:56:13.792 --> 00:56:15.825
MARK: (whispering) What do you hear?

00:56:15.825 --> 00:56:18.108
LAURA: I hear a chime.

00:56:18.108 --> 00:56:19.995
TALIESIN: (gong)

00:56:19.995 --> 00:56:22.728
LAURA: No, like little wind chimes. Like we
had at home.

00:56:22.728 --> 00:56:24.215
MARK: Oh, that sounds nice.

00:56:24.215 --> 00:56:25.148
LAURA: Yeah.

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:26.139
MARK: It can't be anything bad.

00:56:26.139 --> 00:56:27.295
LAURA: We used to hang them in our balconies.

00:56:27.295 --> 00:56:30.555
MATT: You can listen up and can hear it for a
moment too as the breeze blows through a second

00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:34.663
time. Kiri makes the same sound (dull thunks).

00:56:34.663 --> 00:56:35.956
LAURA: It sounded like that!

00:56:35.956 --> 00:56:37.032
TALIESIN: Well done.

00:56:37.032 --> 00:56:39.508
MARISHA: Oh yeah. The little bamboo ones. Those
are great.

00:56:39.508 --> 00:56:43.256
MATT: Looks like it's a little bit northward of
where you're headed. A little north--

00:56:43.256 --> 00:56:45.595
LAURA: Febron, is that where the thing is, that
we're going?

00:56:45.595 --> 00:56:47.212
MATT: "I mean, it could be."

00:56:47.212 --> 00:56:49.106
LIAM: North is that way.

00:56:49.106 --> 00:56:55.668
MATT: "It's loosely on the way. If you trust it.
We could avoid it, though."

00:56:55.668 --> 00:56:59.498
LAURA: Oh, so it's not the safe house, it's
another building, for sure?

00:56:59.608 --> 00:57:02.442
MATT: "I don't know what the hell that is. I
haven't heard that out here before."

00:57:02.442 --> 00:57:04.478
LAURA: We should find out what it is.

00:57:04.478 --> 00:57:07.710
TRAVIS: I actually tend to agree. I don't want to
leave things undiscovered.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.460
MATT: "Are you sure about that?"

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.950
MARISHA: What did we pay you for?

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:12.749
MATT: "I'm helping you."

00:57:12.749 --> 00:57:13.901
TRAVIS: Are you?

00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:16.600
MARISHA: It's questionable. It's honestly
debatable.

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.480
MARK: He seems to be doing his best.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.139
MATT: "Thank you."

00:57:20.139 --> 00:57:22.120
MARK: Don't thank me, you're weird.

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:29.505
LIAM: Frumpkin. I'm going to sit on a relatively
dry spot if I can find one. I'm going to go blind

00:57:29.505 --> 00:57:34.777
and deaf and send Frumpkin in the direction, with
Jester's help, towards the sound that she heard.

00:57:34.777 --> 00:57:39.299
MARK: I make it drier for Caleb, using Shape
Water, dry out some of the area.

00:57:39.299 --> 00:57:43.530
MATT: Sure. You cause some of the swamp mass to
pull back a bit.

00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:45.081
LAURA: That's cool.

00:57:45.081 --> 00:57:46.541
TRAVIS: Surf pro.

00:57:46.541 --> 00:57:51.376
MATT: Frumpkin takes a little bit, because this
terrain is not very conducive to prowling cats of

00:57:51.376 --> 00:58:03.683
Frumpkin's size. But Frumpkin heads on for a bit,
coming across the source of this sound. You see

00:58:03.683 --> 00:58:08.439
about 100 or so feet ahead in the direction
where you heard the sound, hanging from one of the

00:58:08.439 --> 00:58:14.028
branches, there is indeed a cluster of carved
chimes that are dangling from a piece of twine

00:58:14.028 --> 00:58:18.884
there. They're banging into each other every now
and then when the breeze slowly comes through.

00:58:18.884 --> 00:58:20.080
LAURA: Just in a tree.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.114
MATT: On a branch, yeah.

00:58:21.114 --> 00:58:22.276
LAURA: Oh, that's creepy.

00:58:22.276 --> 00:58:25.564
LIAM: I will give the group a basic narration as I
see these things.

00:58:25.564 --> 00:58:27.984
MATT: You can give a perception check for
Frumpkin.

00:58:27.984 --> 00:58:37.524
LIAM: My basic perception check is not too bad. It
is a 16.

00:58:37.524 --> 00:58:44.094
MATT: 16, okay. From Frumpkin's view underneath,
you can get a close look at it, and the material

00:58:44.094 --> 00:58:52.433
of the chimes isn't wood. It appears to be
yellowed, old, dried, hollowed bone. The twine

00:58:52.433 --> 00:58:56.669
itself is not twine. It appears to have been
tanned or dried sinew.

00:58:56.669 --> 00:58:58.267
TRAVIS: (disgusted) Oh, yeah.

00:58:58.267 --> 00:58:59.348
LIAM: What was that word?

00:58:59.348 --> 00:59:00.442
MATT: Sinew.

00:59:00.442 --> 00:59:02.662
TRAVIS: Super inviting. Just all the tendons.

00:59:02.662 --> 00:59:05.491
LAURA: Our wind chimes were made of wood.

00:59:05.491 --> 00:59:11.472
LIAM: How much of it are Frumpkin and I looking
at? It's one little ditty or are we talking True

00:59:11.472 --> 00:59:12.700
Detective here?

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.265
MATT: Currently it's just the one chime.

00:59:14.265 --> 00:59:18.205
LAURA: Does Frumpkin see anything around, like any
living things?

00:59:18.205 --> 00:59:20.087
LIAM: I don't hear shit.

00:59:20.087 --> 00:59:22.370
MARISHA: True.

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:24.835
TALIESIN: Does this sound like some sort of ward
against the undead?

00:59:24.835 --> 00:59:31.904
MATT: It doesn't catch your mind as anything that
is a defensive mechanism to undead that you would

00:59:31.904 --> 00:59:32.964
recognize.

00:59:32.964 --> 00:59:34.143
LIAM: It's hanging from a tree?

00:59:34.143 --> 00:59:35.977
MATT: It is, about seven feet above Frumpkin.

00:59:35.977 --> 00:59:37.505
LIAM: I am going to send Frumpkin up the tree.

00:59:37.505 --> 00:59:40.673
MATT: Okay.

00:59:40.673 --> 00:59:44.556
LIAM: I am going to send Frumpkin toward the
branch.

00:59:44.556 --> 00:59:50.792
MATT: Frumpkin manages to climb the tree using the
outside of the somewhat twisted bark, getting to

00:59:50.792 --> 00:59:54.878
the top. From that viewing point, as Frumpkin gets
out there you can-- (laughs)

00:59:54.878 --> 00:59:58.517
LAURA: Do you want to hold my hand? I try to hold
Caleb's hand?

00:59:58.517 --> 01:00:01.170
TRAVIS: (cat growling)

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:02.610
SAM: It's clammy.

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:08.069
MATT: You do see from the top of the branch,
beyond the edge of the fog, there looks to be a

01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:16.810
thick tree that has broken and fallen over about
ten feet from the base. The heavy roots rise up

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:24.411
into this trunk that still stands about nine or
ten feet from the base of the swamp floor. It

01:00:24.411 --> 01:00:33.526
appears like there is a hollow carved into it,
circular, and a curtain that is currently pressed,

01:00:33.526 --> 01:00:38.250
bolted, or nailed into it that is partially
blocking an opening into the tree.

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:41.813
LIAM: Like sealed or nailed in so it's hanging
down?

01:00:41.813 --> 01:00:46.069
MATT: It's hanging down and every now and then a
faint breeze comes through and you see it shift

01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:48.809
ever so slightly. But it's a heavy material.

01:00:48.809 --> 01:00:59.248
LIAM: Okay, what I would like to attempt to do is
send Frumpkin up to and stick his head inside, and

01:00:59.248 --> 01:01:03.250
as soon as I get a little peeky-poo, snap my
fingers and bamf him out into the Fey.

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:06.139
MATT: Okay. As Frumpkin-- make a stealth check.

01:01:06.139 --> 01:01:09.766
ASHLEY: Come on Caleb.

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:10.792
MARISHA: Come on Frumpy.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:11.692
LAURA: Lumpy Frumpy.

01:01:11.692 --> 01:01:12.831
LIAM: A big 13.

01:01:12.831 --> 01:01:14.664
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

01:01:14.664 --> 01:01:16.761
LAURA: It's really good.

01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:17.877
MATT: It is better than 12.

01:01:17.877 --> 01:01:19.103
MARISHA: A baker's dozen.

01:01:19.103 --> 01:01:20.297
LIAM: Remember when I used to get a 45.

01:01:20.297 --> 01:01:30.158
MATT: Frumpkin stalks up through, avoiding the
sleight depressed elements of the floor that fill

01:01:30.158 --> 01:01:35.496
with the thicker bog water. Coming upon the
outskirts you can see the curtain that hangs is

01:01:35.496 --> 01:01:40.509
not cloth. It appears to be a scaled leather-like
material. Actually pretty similar to what you had

01:01:40.509 --> 01:01:46.374
carved from the crocodile the day before. But long
weathered and it's dry towards the top, but the

01:01:46.374 --> 01:01:53.126
base of it seems to have been progressively
moistened by the swamp around it. As such, it's

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:58.116
slightly decomposing, and it has a bit of moss and
algae that's grown on it, giving it a lighter

01:01:58.116 --> 01:02:06.455
green at the tip. Looking inside, there is a layer
of bones that are all broken, and chipped to the

01:02:06.455 --> 01:02:13.229
point where it's given a textured base to the
floor. From this view, you're not able to make out

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:17.226
what the bone source is or what they're from. But
there is a gentle layer of bones of varying

01:02:17.226 --> 01:02:27.992
degrees of age to them. Within there you also
see-- there is natural rot on the inside of this

01:02:27.992 --> 01:02:33.773
trunk, that's let it easily be carved away. There
appears to be a matted pile of something in the

01:02:33.773 --> 01:02:38.370
corner. Other than that, in the brief instant that
Frumpkin's paying attention, it appears to be empty.

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.408
LAURA: That pile was definitely something
sleeping.

01:02:41.408 --> 01:02:47.942
MATT: Frumpkin returns to his realm.

01:02:47.942 --> 01:02:56.058
LIAM: Oh yeah, like I was saying to you, there is
a tree out there and there is something sleeping

01:02:56.058 --> 01:02:57.075
in it.

01:02:57.075 --> 01:02:59.953
TRAVIS: Did you hear anything, snoring?

01:02:59.953 --> 01:03:03.905
LIAM: No, but there are a lot of bones there. They
looked like--

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:05.100
LAURA: What kind of bones?

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.464
LIAM: They are not chicken bones.

01:03:06.464 --> 01:03:07.630
LAURA: Like gator bones, maybe though?

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:09.686
LIAM: Well, they were probably smaller than that,
yeah?

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:13.563
MATT: You didn't get a good, long look at them.
You literally got in quickly and went (poof).

01:03:13.563 --> 01:03:16.584
TRAVIS: Jester, bones aren't normally a very good
sign.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:19.265
MARK: That doesn't seem very good.

01:03:19.265 --> 01:03:23.523
LIAM: There was something in the corner. Something
that was not bones, but it wasn't moving.

01:03:23.523 --> 01:03:26.250
LAURA: I bet it was a friendly person.

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.856
LIAM: It definitely wasn't the thing we're
looking for.

01:03:28.856 --> 01:03:30.705
TRAVIS: You didn't happen to see a bowl, did you?

01:03:30.705 --> 01:03:34.208
LIAM: I did not see a bowl. I made a perception
check.

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:39.283
MATT: In the brief instant you looked in there,
you got a few details in the interior before

01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:40.340
pulling way.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.905
LIAM: Yes, not bowls, just bones.

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:47.344
LAURA: I'll tell you what, let's go to the safe
house and then we'll come back if we are not

01:03:47.344 --> 01:03:50.385
completely almost dead, and see what we see
there.

01:03:50.385 --> 01:03:52.107
LIAM: Save it for a rainy day.

01:03:52.107 --> 01:03:53.370
TRAVIS: Very wise.

01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:58.141
LAURA: Especially if there is no bowl in the safe
house. Then we know some other place to look for it.

01:03:58.141 --> 01:04:01.507
LIAM: This one's a gimme, a bonus, only if we feel
up to it.

01:04:01.507 --> 01:04:04.401
MARK: You're all so brave.

01:04:04.401 --> 01:04:07.907
TRAVIS: Do you think we'll be able to find our way
back here? Should we mark a tree or something like that?

01:04:07.907 --> 01:04:09.946
LAURA: Let's mark a tree.

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.027
TALIESIN: I've got that.

01:04:11.027 --> 01:04:13.380
MARISHA: Cause Fabron doesn't seem to know which
way his ass is, so.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.043
MATT: "That's not true at all."

01:04:15.043 --> 01:04:16.306
TRAVIS: Which way's your ass?

01:04:16.306 --> 01:04:17.590
MATT: "It's right here."

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:18.944
LIAM: North is--

01:04:18.944 --> 01:04:20.016
MATT: "It's that way."

01:04:20.016 --> 01:04:21.846
LIAM: North is-- no it is that way.

01:04:21.846 --> 01:04:23.639
MATT: "That's what I said."

01:04:23.639 --> 01:04:27.222
LIAM: You're pointing over there, I'm pointing
over here. North is that way.

01:04:27.222 --> 01:04:28.526
MATT: "Yeah."

01:04:28.526 --> 01:04:31.241
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out my sword, and I'm
going to carve into the side of the tree a big

01:04:31.241 --> 01:04:34.819
sign that says "Here Lies Salty Pete" with an
arrow down, straight below.

01:04:34.819 --> 01:04:37.302
MARK: Who's Salty Pete?

01:04:37.302 --> 01:04:41.167
TALIESIN: I don't know, but it sounds like
something awful happened to him, doesn't it?

01:04:41.167 --> 01:04:42.646
MARK: Aw, that's really sad.

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:49.457
TALIESIN: Do you have a way of magically marking
this as well so we can have a bit of a compass?

01:04:49.457 --> 01:04:51.072
LIAM: A compass?

01:04:51.072 --> 01:04:55.190
TALIESIN: Yeah like a point-- can you do a thing
where you can put a pin in this tree?

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:57.272
MARK: Can you do that, Mr. Caleb?

01:04:57.272 --> 01:05:02.252
LIAM: Well, a couple things, one, this is a
compass.

01:05:02.252 --> 01:05:03.717
TALIESIN: That's true! Never mind.

01:05:03.717 --> 01:05:05.101
LAURA: Oh, we'll find our way back.

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:10.556
LIAM: That's not an issue. But if you want to know
if something's happening here with Salty Pete, we

01:05:10.556 --> 01:05:14.487
can also do that if you give me ten minutes. But
it doesn't seem like that's what you're--

01:05:14.487 --> 01:05:17.090
TALIESIN: No, that's not fair. As long as we can
make our way back here again one way or the other,

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:18.641
and I suppose that's true.

01:05:18.641 --> 01:05:22.889
LIAM: I do not know where the safe house is, but
anywhere we have been we can get to again.

01:05:22.889 --> 01:05:24.023
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:05:24.023 --> 01:05:26.615
LAURA: (singing) Let's go to the safe house then.

01:05:26.615 --> 01:05:28.029
MATT: You continue moving on?

01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:29.118
TRAVIS: Lead on.

01:05:29.118 --> 01:05:34.057
MATT: Febron goes, "All right. That way," and he
points in the direction and ushers you forward.

01:05:34.057 --> 01:05:36.797
TRAVIS: You did a good job the first time, let's
take it up again.

01:05:36.797 --> 01:05:37.845
MARISHA: All right.

01:05:37.845 --> 01:05:41.969
MATT: What pace are you moving at? Normal pace,
slow pace, fast pace?

01:05:41.969 --> 01:05:45.921
SAM: We always move at a medium pace.

01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:47.394
MATT: Okay, medium pace it is.

01:05:47.394 --> 01:05:57.418
LAURA: Wait, hold on, let me look at what I have.
I could cast Pass Without a Trace on anyone within

01:05:57.418 --> 01:05:59.079
30 feet of me.

01:05:59.079 --> 01:06:01.345
MATT: You could. You have to move at a slow pace
to move stealthily, though.

01:06:01.345 --> 01:06:04.600
TRAVIS: I think our speed is halved in the
conditions, right?

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.165
MATT: For the most of it, yeah.

01:06:06.165 --> 01:06:07.746
LAURA: Oh, so it would be super slow.

01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:09.152
TRAVIS: Doing the slo-mo game.

01:06:09.152 --> 01:06:15.477
LAURA: Well, maybe not then. Maybe when we go back
to the creepy tree, we can do that.

01:06:15.477 --> 01:06:26.256
MATT: As you continue on, Febron and-- Beau, are
you the other one with Febron doing the survival checks?

01:06:26.256 --> 01:06:27.334
MARISHA: I think so.

01:06:27.334 --> 01:06:28.613
MATT: Make one more.

01:06:28.613 --> 01:06:36.054
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Natural 20! Gil!

01:06:36.054 --> 01:06:45.658
MATT: As you guys begin to watch the treeline
slowly thin, Febron's like, "Oh, it's a good sign.

01:06:45.658 --> 01:06:49.611
"We're getting very close to getting out of this
fucking swamp and getting next to the Ounterloch

01:06:49.611 --> 01:06:54.188
"that'll lead us there. No issue, no more of this."
Right as he's saying that, you watch him about to

01:06:54.188 --> 01:06:58.599
step into another one of those open plants that
begins to quake, and you watch as it's about to

01:06:58.599 --> 01:07:00.805
release this burst of pollen, Beau.

01:07:00.805 --> 01:07:03.420
MARISHA: I go: Oh, you're about to-- watch it!

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:08.908
MATT: You don't stop him, you just point it out.
It goes (puffing).

01:07:08.908 --> 01:07:12.912
SAM: Nice, he's dead.

01:07:12.912 --> 01:07:19.535
MATT: He goes, "What? (coughing)" and starts
walking straight towards it.

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:24.800
MARISHA: Oh, I grab him. Can I reach out and grab
him? Trying to cover my mouth.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.967
MATT: Make an athletics check for you to try and
grapple him.

01:07:28.967 --> 01:07:31.590
MARISHA: Either that or we lose our shithole
guide.

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:33.948
TRAVIS: Which is really not losing much at this
point.

01:07:33.948 --> 01:07:38.709
MARISHA: No. Okay, we lose our 100 gold
investment. Athletics, right?

01:07:38.709 --> 01:07:41.951
MATT: Acrobatics. Sorry, athletics for you to
grapple him.

01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:47.921
MARISHA: Okay. Ooh! Nope, it's worse than I
thought. It's real bad. It's an eight.

01:07:47.921 --> 01:07:51.683
MATT: You reach and grab him, but he shrugs off
your arm and starts walking.

01:07:51.683 --> 01:07:56.872
MARK: As he's about to step, can I cast Levitate
on him and lift him up into the air? He doesn't

01:07:56.872 --> 01:08:01.435
step on it, with the claw, the green magic comes
out and (whoosh) up into the air.

01:08:01.435 --> 01:08:07.325
MATT: He continues to walk towards it, and then
glides up in the air and is floating. He's

01:08:07.325 --> 01:08:12.556
reaching towards it, and the plant (slurping) and
is trying to reach for him.

01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:18.148
MARISHA: I take my staff and bat him away like a
helium balloon. Just start batting him back over

01:08:18.148 --> 01:08:21.305
away from it.

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:27.341
MATT: He's now floating and slowly rotating in the
air, like (grunting).

01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:32.195
MARK: I'll be raising him up and down, shaking him
in the air, like, "Come on, shake out of it, come on!"

01:08:32.195 --> 01:08:38.209
TRAVIS: Maybe we try to outmaneuver this one now.

01:08:38.209 --> 01:08:41.016
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think we've already had our fun
with the one.

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:45.784
LAURA: I open my journal and start drawing him as
a balloon.

01:08:45.784 --> 01:08:47.537
SAM: Hold on. We're not done.

01:08:47.537 --> 01:08:49.523
TALIESIN: No, there's a lot happening over there.

01:08:49.523 --> 01:08:53.645
MATT: It takes you the better part of a minute to
finally shake him out of it, before he goes, "Oh,

01:08:53.645 --> 01:08:57.196
"is it-- what? Shit! (yelling) Shit, what's going
on?!"

01:08:57.196 --> 01:08:58.416
LAURA: (shushing)

01:08:58.416 --> 01:09:02.394
MATT: The plant's still below him, going like
(slurping).

01:09:02.394 --> 01:09:06.592
MARK: Ms. Beau, could you nudge him off to the
side? I'm getting tired of this.

01:09:06.592 --> 01:09:10.562
MATT: You poke him and he begins to glide over--

01:09:10.562 --> 01:09:12.008
MARK: Then I'll lower him down--

01:09:12.008 --> 01:09:22.439
MATT: The plant is now turning towards him, slowly
shifting in his direction, and he's like "Backing

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:23.719
"away, there's a fucking--"

01:09:23.719 --> 01:09:27.738
MARISHA: Can I now grab him by the collar and try
and drag him away?

01:09:27.738 --> 01:09:30.071
MATT: Yeah, you move around the side and you pull
him away.

01:09:30.071 --> 01:09:31.066
MARISHA: Come on.

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:35.249
MATT: You guys begin to pick up your pace. This
plant is not very fast-moving, and you, even

01:09:35.249 --> 01:09:41.459
moving at your slower pace, it can't keep up with
you and it eventually gives up and disappears into

01:09:41.459 --> 01:09:42.826
the fog behind you.

01:09:42.826 --> 01:09:45.486
TALIESIN: The loneliest plant.

01:09:45.486 --> 01:09:47.688
MATT: I love that you roll a 20 to see it before
him and and went, "Sure."

01:09:47.688 --> 01:09:50.283
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:09:50.283 --> 01:09:51.486
MATT: I love it, it's great.

01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:52.897
MARISHA: Watch your step, man! Ah.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:55.014
MATT: Yeah. All righty.

01:09:55.014 --> 01:10:00.008
LIAM: Febron. You've been through this swamp once
or many times?

01:10:00.008 --> 01:10:06.939
MATT: "I've been through it a few times, but
usually it's with a group of other smugglers, and

01:10:06.939 --> 01:10:10.946
"they take care of me and protect me, like you are.
Thank you."

01:10:10.946 --> 01:10:16.469
LIAM: It's a bit late in the game, but are you
being completely forthright with us? Is he?

01:10:16.469 --> 01:10:17.872
MARK: You're welcome.

01:10:17.872 --> 01:10:19.077
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:10:19.077 --> 01:10:21.260
LIAM: That is a natural one.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.597
MATT: It's hard to read.

01:10:23.597 --> 01:10:29.022
LIAM: Can I make a suggestion, Febron? And I cast
Suggestion on Febron.

01:10:29.022 --> 01:10:32.899
MATT: Okay.

01:10:32.899 --> 01:10:39.290
LIAM: I feel you should be completely honest with
us from this point on, because you know, honesty,

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:42.102
it's the easiest thing to remember.

01:10:42.102 --> 01:10:47.604
MATT: "You know, I appreciate that. I don't
appreciate you casting spells to fuck with all my

01:10:47.604 --> 01:10:53.551
"mind and shit. But I've been honest! I'm going to
make some honest coin, and I'm doing my fucking

01:10:53.551 --> 01:10:57.212
"best, all right? Now come on, it's this way."

01:10:57.212 --> 01:10:59.983
LIAM: It's that way.

01:10:59.983 --> 01:11:06.636
MATT: "(stuttering) Not north, where we're going!"
At this point, you guys can see the very edge of

01:11:06.636 --> 01:11:11.923
the water is now starting to show through the fog
and you can see where bits of the lake are hitting the

01:11:11.923 --> 01:11:14.500
shoreline, and you have reached the Ounterloch in
the middle of the Labenda Swamp.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.895
LAURA: Hey, there's a lake!

01:11:15.895 --> 01:11:17.916
TALIESIN: With that, life delivers a pleasant
surprise.

01:11:17.916 --> 01:11:21.730
LAURA: Febron.

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:22.824
MATT: "Yeah?"

01:11:22.824 --> 01:11:24.417
LAURA: Are there monsters in this lake?

01:11:24.417 --> 01:11:29.081
MATT: "I don't know, I don't go into it. I
recommend not getting too close, just in case. We

01:11:29.081 --> 01:11:32.492
"usually stay right on the coastal side of it, you
know?"

01:11:32.492 --> 01:11:33.558
LAURA: Okay.

01:11:33.558 --> 01:11:34.438
MATT: "Perfect."

01:11:34.438 --> 01:11:35.538
LAURA: (splashing)

01:11:35.538 --> 01:11:36.860
MATT: "No, what're you doing?! No, shit!"

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.099
LAURA: Then I go back out. I just wanted to see.

01:11:39.099 --> 01:11:47.626
MATT: The whole time you're doing that, Kiri's
like (chirping). Who's keeping watch on this?

01:11:47.626 --> 01:11:49.278
SAM: Keeping watch?

01:11:49.278 --> 01:11:50.218
MATT: Yes.

01:11:50.218 --> 01:11:51.371
SAM: What do you mean?

01:11:51.371 --> 01:11:54.971
MATT: I need you and probably Beau, since you were
with Febron before, make a perception check, please.

01:11:54.971 --> 01:12:01.951
TRAVIS: Ooh, 17 plus one. 18.

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:03.746
MARISHA: Ten.

01:12:03.746 --> 01:12:11.981
MATT: Okay. As you guys are trudging along on the
bank of this lake, heading northward, Fjord, out

01:12:11.981 --> 01:12:17.691
of the corner of your eye you see a shadow shift
in the trees to the left of you. You glance back

01:12:17.691 --> 01:12:21.282
and you see something disappear behind a tree,
about 40, 50 feet off.

01:12:21.282 --> 01:12:28.556
TRAVIS: Hold. I saw movement. Off to our side, 40
to 50 feet into the trees.

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:29.753
SAM: Which side?

01:12:29.849 --> 01:12:30.620
MATT: To the left side.

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:33.433
SAM: There's nothing over here on my side.

01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:35.712
MARK: Should we pretend like we haven't seen it,
we should just carry on as normal?

01:12:35.712 --> 01:12:38.256
MARISHA: No, that's not-- just no one move.

01:12:38.256 --> 01:12:39.471
MARK: Okay.

01:12:39.471 --> 01:12:40.593
LAURA: We just freeze?

01:12:40.593 --> 01:12:42.424
TRAVIS: Fan out a little bit.

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:45.565
LIAM: If we don't move, that's also a little
weird.

01:12:45.565 --> 01:12:48.293
TRAVIS: Yeah, fan out. Who wants to move towards
it with me?

01:12:48.293 --> 01:12:49.632
ASHLEY: I will move towards it with you.

MARK: I'll come.

01:12:50.792 --> 01:12:51.872
ASHLEY: I'll take out my blade.

01:12:51.872 --> 01:12:53.613
MARK: I'll come with you.

01:12:53.613 --> 01:12:55.420
LIAM: I walk in the opposite direction.

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:58.326
TALIESIN: Fighters move forward, magic peoples
hang back.

01:12:58.326 --> 01:13:00.007
LAURA: Maybe I shouldn't move forward.

01:13:00.007 --> 01:13:02.120
MATT: So you guys are heading towards the shadow
you saw?

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:07.153
TRAVIS: Yasha, Molly, Cali, and Fjord. We'll walk
towards it.

01:13:07.153 --> 01:13:09.357
LAURA: I stay right where I am.

01:13:09.424 --> 01:13:13.660
TRAVIS: But fan out, not together. Maybe ten, 15
feet in between us. Like a fire line.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:17.043
LIAM: Let's go, I say as I walk backwards.

01:13:17.075 --> 01:13:18.531
MATT: Fjord, Molly, and Yasha like that?

01:13:18.531 --> 01:13:19.688
MARK: I'm going as well.

01:13:19.688 --> 01:13:20.700
MATT: And Beau?

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.004
MARK: And Cali, right?

01:13:22.004 --> 01:13:23.674
LIAM: That mini.

01:13:23.674 --> 01:13:25.300
TRAVIS: But fanned fire line.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.832
LIAM: Oh, the tail's there!

01:13:26.832 --> 01:13:27.940
MARISHA: Look at you!

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:31.006
ALL: Ooh!

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:34.912
MARK: That was a real rush job that I had to order
a day before I flew out.

01:13:34.912 --> 01:13:36.113
MARISHA: You're smexy.

01:13:36.113 --> 01:13:38.804
LIAM: Just pull it over here for a second.

01:13:38.804 --> 01:13:44.135
MATT: You begin to turn and approach and you guys
form your line moving forward. You watch as

01:13:44.135 --> 01:13:51.270
something lumbering moves. It's still on the edge
of the fog, and it shifts from the tree where it

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:57.886
was to a tree further back and then ducks behind
another tree. It's not very stealthy, though it

01:13:57.886 --> 01:13:59.050
thinks it might be.

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:03.113
TRAVIS: Is it moving fast-- easily in this
terrain?

01:14:03.113 --> 01:14:04.825
MATT: It seems to be moving fairly easily in the
terrain.

01:14:04.825 --> 01:14:05.725
LAURA: What is it?

01:14:05.725 --> 01:14:07.057
LIAM: (as Gollum) What is it?

01:14:07.057 --> 01:14:09.286
MARK: (as Gollum) What did you say?

01:14:09.286 --> 01:14:18.671
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to stealthily do
some monk (footsteps) up to it a bit.

01:14:18.671 --> 01:14:20.837
LAURA: Maybe it's something nice!

01:14:20.837 --> 01:14:22.375
MARISHA: See if I can get a better look.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:25.828
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:28.411
MARISHA: Oh my god, 14.

01:14:28.411 --> 01:14:29.648
LAURA: What's happening?

01:14:29.648 --> 01:14:37.206
MATT: Okay. As you tiptoe through the edges,
leaping from cluster of root to cluster of root,

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:42.615
being as quiet as you can, you come around the
first tree where this figure had vanished, look

01:14:42.615 --> 01:14:49.176
around to where it's currently waiting and you see
two trees that grew together and a large rock

01:14:49.176 --> 01:14:56.711
that's wedged at the base of it. Crouched below,
behind the rock, you see this bulbous humanoid

01:14:56.711 --> 01:15:07.970
creature, with a deep green-blue skin tone with
little pustules and boils on it, at the edges of

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:13.496
the shoulder and arm. You see long stringy black
hair that goes past the front of the chest. The

01:15:13.496 --> 01:15:19.073
torso appears to be swollen, this belly protruding
beyond it. You can see hanging around the neck

01:15:19.073 --> 01:15:24.971
other pieces of hollowed bone, very similar to
that chime that you saw being described by Caleb.

01:15:24.971 --> 01:15:26.743
MARISHA: Is it a troll?

01:15:26.743 --> 01:15:33.599
MATT: It appears to be trollish in nature. The
pustules and part of its body, there's this thick

01:15:33.599 --> 01:15:39.636
green liquid that's oozing out in places. It's
sitting there clinging to the rock with its long

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:43.498
fingers, clutching it, looking over in the
direction of where you were, breathing heavy.

01:15:43.498 --> 01:15:47.515
MARISHA: Does he see The Mighty Nein?

01:15:47.515 --> 01:15:49.542
MATT: It seems to be looking in the direction
where you were.

01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:51.646
MARISHA: But he doesn't see me.

01:15:51.646 --> 01:15:53.521
MATT: He doesn't see you at the moment, no.

01:15:53.521 --> 01:15:55.013
TRAVIS: (whispering) Do not see me!

01:15:55.013 --> 01:16:00.295
MARISHA: How far away am I from him?

01:16:00.295 --> 01:16:02.690
MATT: You're about 35 feet from it.

01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:06.467
MARISHA: Could I theoretically throw something
behind him?

01:16:06.467 --> 01:16:08.669
MATT: You could certainly try.

01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:19.512
MARISHA: Yeah, sure. I'm going to take out a
handful of ball bearings and try and toss them.

01:16:19.512 --> 01:16:24.424
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check to do so
without making a very visible toss.

01:16:24.424 --> 01:16:27.356
LAURA: Yeah, right? No sound at all.

01:16:27.356 --> 01:16:32.984
MARISHA: 24-- 22.

01:16:32.984 --> 01:16:43.970
MATT: You take the handful and lob them quietly,
as far as you can. You hear very faint impacts of

01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:53.184
them about 25, 30 feet off. The trollish creature
goes (snarling) and pushes off the rock a bit,

01:16:53.184 --> 01:16:59.618
looking that direction. Looks over the rock, looks
back in that direction. It's now looking like he's

01:16:59.618 --> 01:17:02.291
paranoid and keeping tabs on both sides.

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:05.085
MARISHA: I'm going to stealth back.

01:17:05.085 --> 01:17:07.405
MATT: Make another stealth check.

01:17:07.405 --> 01:17:12.655
MARISHA: 19.

01:17:12.655 --> 01:17:17.024
MATT: You manage pull back to the rest of the
group as you guys are holding your line, waiting

01:17:17.024 --> 01:17:18.432
for Beau to return.

01:17:18.432 --> 01:17:21.779
MARISHA: It's a troll. Like a--

01:17:21.779 --> 01:17:24.708
TRAVIS: Toucan? With a belly?

01:17:24.708 --> 01:17:26.426
ASHLEY: He's got a beak?

01:17:26.426 --> 01:17:28.668
MARISHA: No. He's like a troll.

01:17:28.668 --> 01:17:29.867
LAURA: (loudly) What are you saying, Beau?

01:17:29.867 --> 01:17:30.929
TRAVIS: Shh, Jester!

01:17:30.929 --> 01:17:37.914
MARISHA: I think he knows we're here. But he's a
slimy undead troll-like guy.

01:17:37.914 --> 01:17:41.850
MARK: That sounds really bad. Let's not go near
it.

01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:46.225
MARISHA: I also think he might be who lives in
that hut.

01:17:46.225 --> 01:17:47.646
SAM: How do you know that?

01:17:47.646 --> 01:17:50.492
MARISHA: Because he looked bony.

01:17:50.492 --> 01:17:53.114
MARK: That's a reasonable deduction.

01:17:53.114 --> 01:17:56.846
LAURA: (loudly) Maybe there's lots of them around
too.

01:17:56.846 --> 01:17:58.298
SAM: Shut up, Jester.

01:17:58.298 --> 01:18:00.497
TALIESIN: Theater whisper.

01:18:00.497 --> 01:18:03.240
MARISHA: I don't think we want to deal with them,
though.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.639
TRAVIS: We'll keep moving around the edge of the
lake. Who wants to keep an eye on his area as

01:18:06.639 --> 01:18:07.676
we're moving?

01:18:07.676 --> 01:18:09.376
MARISHA: I think he's stalking us.

01:18:09.376 --> 01:18:10.644
LAURA: I will.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:16.492
TRAVIS: Jester and Molly, you keep an eye as we
keep moving forward. We'll come back to where the

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:17.649
casters are.

01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:18.843
SAM: Are you going to stay behind?

01:18:18.843 --> 01:18:22.224
TRAVIS: No, they're going to stay with us in a
tight group. But they're going to keep their eyes

01:18:22.224 --> 01:18:23.253
as we move.

01:18:23.253 --> 01:18:24.826
MARK: It's all right, little Bren, they'll look
after us.

01:18:24.826 --> 01:18:28.168
SAM: Who? Oh me, yes! Thank you.

01:18:28.168 --> 01:18:33.837
TRAVIS: Mind your slice of the pie, all right, you
guys? You're a fan of pie, so.

01:18:33.837 --> 01:18:35.119
LAURA: Got it.

01:18:35.119 --> 01:18:37.274
MATT: (like Fjord) "You're a fan of pie."
(chirping)

01:18:37.274 --> 01:18:38.714
LAURA: I am a fan of pie, Kiri!

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:41.915
MATT: Do you guys continue onward?

01:18:41.915 --> 01:18:43.058
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:18:43.058 --> 01:18:44.257
SAM: Stealthy, though.

01:18:44.257 --> 01:18:47.052
LAURA: We are keeping an eye on the troll.

01:18:47.052 --> 01:18:52.033
MATT: You are out in the open, at the edge of
where the lake is, beyond the treeline. Being

01:18:52.033 --> 01:18:55.387
stealthy here means being quiet, but you're still
very much out in the open.

01:18:55.387 --> 01:18:58.474
LIAM: So you're saying there's a chance.

01:18:58.474 --> 01:19:04.056
MATT: I'm saying if an entity knows you're there,
if you're not trying to obscure your visual,

01:19:04.056 --> 01:19:08.242
you're going to have a hard time avoiding it.

01:19:08.242 --> 01:19:09.908
SAM: Should we create a distraction for it first?

01:19:09.908 --> 01:19:13.132
TALIESIN: Let's just pay attention, and if it
starts getting close then we'll deal with it.

01:19:13.132 --> 01:19:17.348
We're just not going to let it escape. We're just
going to keep an eye out for it.

01:19:17.348 --> 01:19:21.922
MARISHA: It might be better if we move quicker
through here as well, instead of stealthily.

01:19:21.922 --> 01:19:26.295
MARK: I'm sure if you pray to the Platinum Dragon,
we'll be all right.

01:19:26.295 --> 01:19:34.493
LIAM: (inaudible chanting)

01:19:34.493 --> 01:19:39.390
MATT: As you guys push on, Febron's looking
extremely nervous now that you've mentioned this

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:46.117
creature. "Wait, are you saying you saw this troll
thing? Over there?"

01:19:46.117 --> 01:19:49.035
TRAVIS: Heard of something like that around here?

01:19:49.035 --> 01:19:53.949
MATT: "Only heard rumors and we talk about various
things that live out there, trolls is definitely

01:19:53.949 --> 01:19:55.358
"one of them."

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:57.922
MARISHA: How long have you lived here?

01:19:57.922 --> 01:20:04.130
MATT: "Through the ages, there have been all sorts
of stories. There's uglier trolls here. Swamp

01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:08.346
"trolls, mountain trolls, all types, and this one,
it wouldn't surprise me. I haven't seen one, but I

01:20:08.346 --> 01:20:15.307
"stay perfectly quiet. Quieter than you usually do
as a group. I'm just going to stay here," and

01:20:15.307 --> 01:20:17.736
clings behind you, Fjord, like as a shield.

01:20:17.736 --> 01:20:26.354
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know if that's going to work
for me. All right, let's get moving. Try and

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:27.501
ignore this.

01:20:27.501 --> 01:20:33.063
MATT: You guys move on, taking care to be quiet,
but not out of sight. If you want to be stealthy

01:20:33.063 --> 01:20:34.678
in that regard, make a stealth check.

01:20:34.678 --> 01:20:38.849
TRAVIS: We'll give him a chance whether he engages
or not

01:20:38.849 --> 01:20:41.142
MARISHA: We wanted to move faster.

01:20:41.142 --> 01:20:42.996
MATT: So then no stealth?

01:20:43.259 --> 01:20:43.875
TRAVIS: No stealth.

01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:46.430
MATT: So you guys continue pushing forward at your
regular pace.

01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:51.187
TRAVIS: Maybe a little faster than our regular,
too.

01:20:51.187 --> 01:20:54.602
MARK: That was really brave, by the way, you
sneaking off like that and finding it out.

01:20:54.602 --> 01:20:58.589
MARISHA: Thank you. You're so complimentary. It
makes me a little nauseous.

01:20:58.589 --> 01:21:04.173
MARK: I was raised and people were really nice to
me, they used to tell me I was special and how

01:21:04.173 --> 01:21:07.215
important I was and it made me feel nice, so I try
and do that for everyone else.

01:21:07.215 --> 01:21:13.117
MARISHA: Man, that's so sweet. Ugh. Where are you
from?

01:21:13.117 --> 01:21:18.150
MARK: Thank you! Technically I was born in Port
Damali, but I didn't spend a lot of time there. I

01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:23.960
lived on the streets on my own and then I was
taken in by some people.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.287
MARISHA: Really?

01:21:25.287 --> 01:21:26.298
TRAVIS: Some people?

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:31.810
MARK: Yeah, I guess-- You guys have been nice to
me, I can tell. You know I mentioned those folks

01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:37.542
in the dragon masks, the cult? They were the ones
that raised me.

01:21:37.542 --> 01:21:41.830
LIAM: That's the first time you're introducing the
word "cult" into conversation.

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:44.218
MARK: Oh, sorry, yeah.

01:21:44.218 --> 01:21:46.440
SAM: You're a cultist?

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:50.034
MARK: No. I was raised by them--

01:21:50.034 --> 01:21:51.402
MARISHA: You're an ex-cultist.

01:21:51.402 --> 01:21:52.425
LIAM: Cult adjacent.

01:21:52.425 --> 01:21:54.973
MARK: I guess. I mean--

01:21:54.973 --> 01:21:56.864
SAM: Cult-ish?

01:21:56.864 --> 01:21:58.224
MARIK: Cult-ish, maybe.

01:21:58.224 --> 01:22:02.128
MATT: (like Nott) "You're a cultist? You're a
cultist?"

01:22:02.128 --> 01:22:04.519
MARK: All right, stop, bird! Stop saying that
word! I don't like it.

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:08.492
TALIESIN: Did you have your own mask or do they
just wear masks, out of curiosity?

01:22:08.492 --> 01:22:14.265
MARK: I didn't get a mask because I wasn't allowed
out. They kept me in the temple. It's because they

01:22:14.265 --> 01:22:17.718
were bad, all right? I'm glad that I'm not with
them anymore. They're bad people.

01:22:17.718 --> 01:22:19.403
LIAM: So they did this to you?

01:22:19.403 --> 01:22:21.332
MARK: No, I've always been like this.

01:22:21.332 --> 01:22:23.694
MARISHA: They worshiped you?

01:22:23.694 --> 01:22:27.333
MARK: Yeah, they told me I was special. I was
important to them somehow.

MATT: Yasha and Fjord, as they're having this
conversation, you're watching at the flanks and

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:35.643
you can see the shape of that troll creature is
still moving from tree to tree, keeping pace with

01:22:35.643 --> 01:22:36.941
your movement.

01:22:36.941 --> 01:22:37.937
ASHLEY: Fjord.

01:22:37.937 --> 01:22:40.100
TRAVIS: I saw it. What do you want to do?

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:44.356
ASHLEY: There's one of him and however the fuck
many of us.

01:22:44.356 --> 01:22:46.164
LIAM: How far back is he?

01:22:46.164 --> 01:22:47.850
TRAVIS: Not too far.

01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:51.284
MATT: It's not approaching you, but it's keeping
pace.

01:22:51.284 --> 01:22:56.606
MARISHA: We're on rough terrain right now?

01:22:56.606 --> 01:23:04.479
MATT: You're not in the center of the swamp where
it's a lot of shifting topography and roots and

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:10.293
vines and patches of deep water you have to come
across. You're along the coast of this lake, so

01:23:10.293 --> 01:23:14.204
it's mainly soggy dirt and sand, so it's not rough
terrain where you are.

01:23:14.204 --> 01:23:16.967
MARISHA: But where he is, it would be considered
rough terrain?

01:23:16.967 --> 01:23:23.053
MATT: Yes. But you also have no protection. You're
literally out in the open.

01:23:23.053 --> 01:23:28.831
MARISHA: We can try to send someone ahead as bait,
lure him out, fight him on steady ground?

01:23:28.831 --> 01:23:31.330
TRAVIS: Or we could just keep letting him match.

01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:40.742
LAURA: The thing is, what if something bad comes
in front of us and then they trap us? Because he's

01:23:40.742 --> 01:23:42.141
just following us.

01:23:42.141 --> 01:23:44.365
MARK: Why isn't he attacking us?

01:23:44.365 --> 01:23:48.213
LAURA: Maybe he has friends ahead that he's
waiting on.

01:23:48.213 --> 01:23:54.238
TALIESIN: I tend to find things that live in trees
filled with bones tend to not have necessarily many

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:59.965
friends. I'm just putting it out there. I have
nothing else to base that off of, but it didn't

01:23:59.965 --> 01:24:03.821
look like a very social creature.

01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:09.870
LIAM: So if we feel like we want to get into a
scrap, I or probably our new friend here could

01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:12.712
kick it off from a ways away.

01:24:12.712 --> 01:24:17.375
TRAVIS: We could, or Jester, you're pretty
friendly. You want to see if--?

01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:18.612
LAURA: It's a friend?

01:24:18.612 --> 01:24:20.957
LIAM: The troll.

01:24:20.957 --> 01:24:29.502
MARISHA: He had green pus-y ooze pouring out of
holes in his face. Just want to throw that out there.

01:24:29.502 --> 01:24:33.367
SAM: You could heal him and curry favor with him.

01:24:33.367 --> 01:24:41.120
LAURA: I could if I made myself look like a little
teeny troll. And they would want to be friends

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.430
with me.

01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:44.364
MARISHA: I got undead vibes from this guy?

01:24:44.364 --> 01:24:49.488
LIAM: Also, you are very charming, but every book
that I have ever read about trolls-- They do not

01:24:49.488 --> 01:24:52.390
make friends. They are bitter, nasty things.

01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:56.330
ASHLEY: They eat you if you're little, you know.

01:24:56.330 --> 01:25:01.172
MARISHA: He definitely had like a collarbone just
hanging out.

01:25:01.172 --> 01:25:03.173
TALIESIN: Can I see him from here?

01:25:03.173 --> 01:25:04.747
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:25:04.747 --> 01:25:07.996
TALIESIN: Seven.

01:25:07.996 --> 01:25:09.379
MATT: You do not.

01:25:09.379 --> 01:25:12.668
TALIESIN: Do I technically have advantage because
it's trying to perceive an undead creature?

01:25:12.668 --> 01:25:15.941
MATT: No, because you don't know if this
creature's undead or not.

01:25:15.941 --> 01:25:20.165
SAM: What if we set a trap or an ambush for him or
her?

01:25:20.165 --> 01:25:22.873
MARISHA: That's what I literally just said.

01:25:22.873 --> 01:25:33.306
SAM: We could do a little circley-poo and put Cali
in the middle as bait, and then when it comes to

01:25:33.306 --> 01:25:35.590
attack, we spring the trap!

01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:38.248
TRAVIS: What's the trap made of?

01:25:38.248 --> 01:25:39.710
SAM: I don't know, I've been drinking a lot.

01:25:39.710 --> 01:25:45.365
LAURA: What if we ran rope between a couple trees
and then we tripped it?

01:25:45.365 --> 01:25:47.946
LIAM: It's watching us right now, isn't it?

01:25:47.946 --> 01:25:50.509
MARISHA: He probably is hearing everything we're
talking about.

01:25:50.509 --> 01:25:53.697
LIAM: Debatable whether it can understand us, but
perhaps it can.

01:25:53.697 --> 01:25:55.849
LAURA: Man, trolls are so cool!

01:25:55.849 --> 01:26:01.282
TRAVIS: Okay, how about this: Yasha, I'm sure
you'll agree, we can make one move to see if it's

01:26:01.282 --> 01:26:04.936
interested in non-violence and then we have the
advantage here now.

01:26:04.936 --> 01:26:08.207
ASHLEY: I like that idea a lot. Yeah, I would
agree.

01:26:08.207 --> 01:26:10.030
TRAVIS: I don't like being tailed in particular.

01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:13.772
SAM: Someone walks up to it while the others flank
around?

01:26:13.772 --> 01:26:17.385
LAURA: Do you want me to do it, Fjord?

01:26:17.385 --> 01:26:18.593
TRAVIS: Don't you?

01:26:18.593 --> 01:26:24.010
LAURA: Here, you hold Kiri then, because I don't
want her to get too close to it.

01:26:24.010 --> 01:26:25.053
MATT: (chirping)

01:26:25.053 --> 01:26:27.388
LAURA: What are you doing? Why are you holding--?

01:26:27.388 --> 01:26:29.506
SAM and LAURA: No! Put her down!

01:26:29.506 --> 01:26:33.010
MARK: You wouldn't hold your own daughter that
way!

01:26:33.010 --> 01:26:41.122
MATT: (like Nott) "It's me, Bren!" (chirping)
Pulls the dagger out.

01:26:41.122 --> 01:26:51.191
SAM: I'll take Kiri, give me Kiri. Come here,
little Kiri. My father won't hurt you anymore.

01:26:51.191 --> 01:26:58.020
MARK: I'm going to stand closer to Bren. I'm
disappointed in you, Mr. Fjord!

01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:01.777
TRAVIS: That means literally nothing to me.

01:27:01.777 --> 01:27:09.826
MARISHA: She's so formal in her admonishment. Man,
it kind of makes me feel bad. Anyway, let's go.

01:27:09.826 --> 01:27:11.436
I'll flank to the north.

01:27:11.436 --> 01:27:15.807
LAURA: Is the troll just watching all of you go
away?

01:27:15.807 --> 01:27:21.084
MATT: If you're doing this stealthily, then I need
anyone who's trying to not be seen to make a

01:27:21.084 --> 01:27:21.992
stealth check.

01:27:21.992 --> 01:27:23.216
LAURA: Should I try to Pass Without a Trace, you
guys?

01:27:23.216 --> 01:27:24.765
TRAVIS: I don't think we should stealth.

01:27:24.765 --> 01:27:28.927
SAM: It's not an ambush if they can see where we
are.

01:27:28.927 --> 01:27:32.775
TRAVIS: Fuck the ambush. There's nine of us. One
of him.

01:27:32.775 --> 01:27:34.645
SAM: That you know of.

01:27:34.645 --> 01:27:39.342
LIAM: I would, in fact, like to try to walk behind
a tree so I'm obscured.

01:27:39.342 --> 01:27:43.552
MARISHA: I'm going to stealth to the north.

01:27:43.552 --> 01:27:46.022
TALIESIN: I'll join you in the non-stealthing.

01:27:46.022 --> 01:27:53.559
MATT: Beau's stealthing to the north, which will
be here. Fjord, you guys are heading inward.

01:27:53.559 --> 01:27:57.960
TRAVIS: Molly, Yasha, and I will not be stealthing
and heading inward, and we'll be just behind

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.276
Jester's diplomatic envoy.

01:28:00.276 --> 01:28:05.142
LIAM: I don't know if it can see me or not, but I
would like to hold Magic Missile in case it

01:28:05.142 --> 01:28:07.137
attacks my friends.

01:28:07.137 --> 01:28:12.483
ASHLEY: I want to be close enough to Jester in
case anything happens.

01:28:12.483 --> 01:28:13.991
MATT: Jester, where are you standing?

01:28:13.991 --> 01:28:17.655
LAURA: I guess I will be falling back because I'm
going to talk to him.

01:28:17.655 --> 01:28:22.782
TALIESIN: You'll be going in front of us. Because
you're going to talk to him.

01:28:22.782 --> 01:28:24.794
LAURA: I thought the thing was behind us.

01:28:24.794 --> 01:28:28.951
MATT: You guys are heading northward this way. You
guys have to go this way because the lake's all

01:28:28.951 --> 01:28:30.236
this direction.

01:28:30.236 --> 01:28:32.937
MARK: I'm stood next to Nott, with Kiri.

01:28:32.937 --> 01:28:46.581
MATT: Nott and Kiri are back here, and that would
be-- Go off to that side. Febron is like, "I'm

01:28:46.581 --> 01:28:50.715
"going to stay back here with the people in the
back-back, because I want to stay in the back."

01:28:50.715 --> 01:28:52.800
TRAVIS: (sarcastically) Oh no, I was enjoying our
closeness.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.131
MATT: You guys begin to trudge in, deeper into the
swamp.

01:28:58.131 --> 01:29:05.885
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to pull the last of my
pastries, which I'm sure are really fucking gross

01:29:05.885 --> 01:29:06.995
by now.

01:29:06.995 --> 01:29:15.130
MATT: Yeah, they're pretty stale. You're fine. As
you begin to move into the swamp, you do see the

01:29:15.130 --> 01:29:24.136
shape and it's about maybe 60 or so feet from
where you are. You watch it shift, and then shift

01:29:24.136 --> 01:29:26.009
to another tree a little further away.

01:29:26.009 --> 01:29:27.427
MARISHA: He's moving away from us?

01:29:27.427 --> 01:29:28.457
MATT: He's moving away from you.

01:29:28.457 --> 01:29:29.885
TRAVIS: Are we sure it's the same one?

01:29:29.885 --> 01:29:31.347
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:29:31.347 --> 01:29:35.322
TRAVIS: 17.

01:29:35.322 --> 01:29:40.173
MATT: You see one shape move, it's similar to the
one you saw before. You can ascertain that it

01:29:40.173 --> 01:29:42.057
probably is the same creature, yeah.

01:29:42.057 --> 01:29:46.989
MARISHA: Okay, we do not want to follow this bunny
rabbit down the hole.

01:29:46.989 --> 01:29:58.308
LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity and I'm going
to send my duplicate towards the troll. It's skipping.

01:29:58.308 --> 01:30:02.121
LIAM: (singing Peter's Theme from Peter and the
Wolf)

01:30:02.121 --> 01:30:05.293
TRAVIS: Yes, perfect.

01:30:05.293 --> 01:30:10.292
MATT: Make a deception check. No, you don't need
to after that, we'll see if he can see through the

01:30:10.292 --> 01:30:15.888
illusion. It skips ahead. Just keeps walking in
that direction?

01:30:15.888 --> 01:30:21.368
LAURA: Towards the trees, looking like she's
picking some vegetation. I doubt there's flowers.

01:30:21.368 --> 01:30:22.710
TRAVIS: Mushrooms.

01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:25.617
LAURA: But whatever. Yeah. Whatever she can do.

01:30:25.617 --> 01:30:32.796
MATT: 50 feet, 60 feet, gets relatively close to
where you saw the shape vanish.

01:30:32.796 --> 01:30:43.589
LAURA: I'm going to have her turn her back to the
troll and act like she's digging around in the mud.

01:30:43.589 --> 01:30:58.817
MATT: From behind the tree, one of the claws-- The
long, stringy hair dangling, somewhat stuck to its

01:30:58.817 --> 01:31:04.806
neck, shifting with the light breeze that blows
through as it looks back and watches the illusion

01:31:04.806 --> 01:31:08.558
turn and shift. Is it relatively close to the
tree, the illusion?

01:31:08.558 --> 01:31:10.186
LAURA: Pretty close.

01:31:10.186 --> 01:31:16.133
MATT: It sits there and waits, shifts.

01:31:16.133 --> 01:31:18.632
LAURA: I'm going to have her take a couple of
steps away from the tree.

01:31:18.632 --> 01:31:22.478
MATT: It shifts back in its space a little bit.

01:31:22.478 --> 01:31:24.651
LAURA: She's going to step back towards the tree.

01:31:24.651 --> 01:31:34.191
MATT: As soon as it gets within about five or so
feet, the illusion, the troll creature reaches out

01:31:34.191 --> 01:31:39.030
and swings out to grab the illusion, passes
through, and the claws (slash) into the tree. It

01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:44.382
goes (frantic grunting) and then vanishes behind
the tree. You watch it dart, the shadow of it

01:31:44.382 --> 01:31:47.070
vanish behind another tree, and it's moving
further away from where you are.

01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:48.656
LAURA: Don't think it was friendly.

01:31:48.656 --> 01:31:52.372
TRAVIS: Question answered. Did it move away?

01:31:52.372 --> 01:31:53.360
LAURA: Yeah.

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.383
TRAVIS: Do you want to chase it?

01:31:55.383 --> 01:32:01.820
LAURA: I think we should stick to the safe house,
what do you guys think?

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:03.130
TRAVIS: I think that's a good call.

01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:04.192
TALIESIN: For now.

01:32:04.192 --> 01:32:08.557
TRAVIS: We'll stagger back towards the back line
of our group.

01:32:08.557 --> 01:32:09.982
MARISHA: Yeah, continue on.

01:32:09.982 --> 01:32:18.321
LAURA: I'll keep the invoke duplicity, the second
me, skipping through the swamp at a distance.

01:32:18.321 --> 01:32:23.357
MATT: How long does that last? Lasts for a
minute?

01:32:23.357 --> 01:32:25.120
LAURA: Invoke Duplicity lasts I think a minute,
yeah.

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:31.711
MATT: You guys cluster together outside of the
swamp alongside the curvature of the lake, keeping

01:32:31.711 --> 01:32:38.747
an eye on the side, you continue to travel
forward. The lake slowly begins to, as you guys

01:32:38.747 --> 01:32:42.649
are heading northward, along its side it begins to
curve to a northeastern direction, and Febron's

01:32:42.649 --> 01:32:50.813
like, "All right, so this is good. We're getting
closer to the northern side of the lake, which

01:32:50.813 --> 01:32:56.827
"means we're getting close to where we follow the
pearl blades to the safe house. Good, okay." At

01:32:56.827 --> 01:33:01.866
this point, you look over to the side. Who's
keeping a watch on this? Okay, both of you guys

01:33:01.866 --> 01:33:03.555
roll a perception check, please.

01:33:03.555 --> 01:33:08.837
MARISHA: Motherfucker, my perception is balls.

01:33:08.837 --> 01:33:09.907
TRAVIS: 15.

01:33:09.907 --> 01:33:10.954
MARISHA: Nine.

01:33:10.954 --> 01:33:13.213
LAURA: Beau needs to stop looking out for things.

01:33:13.213 --> 01:33:22.777
MATT: 15, you said? You do see the shape now
keeping pace with you again, same distance out

01:33:22.777 --> 01:33:28.950
there. It's stalking you, but it's definitely--
you get the sense, based on the interaction you

01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:33.826
had earlier and the distance it's keeping-- it's
not interested in fighting nine of you. It's

01:33:33.826 --> 01:33:40.748
waiting to pick one of you off and take it
wherever it's going to take it. It's smart enough

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:46.071
to know that it's not going to jump into a fray in
the open space, but it's definitely waiting to see

01:33:46.071 --> 01:33:48.595
what weaker one stays to the back.

01:33:48.595 --> 01:33:55.239
ASHLEY: Can we put some of the little ones-- Nott.
Bren, get in the middle. Kiri.

01:33:55.239 --> 01:33:57.126
SAM: Yep, on my way.

01:33:57.126 --> 01:33:59.252
ASHLEY: I'm going to get in the back.

01:33:59.252 --> 01:34:07.829
MATT: You guys continue heading in a northeastern
direction until eventually you watch the lake come

01:34:07.829 --> 01:34:12.700
to a northern peak and begin to curve back into a
southern area. It looks like the top of the lake

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:19.845
bends to a point northward and then begins to head
southward and level out. At this point, Febron

01:34:19.845 --> 01:34:26.364
goes, "All right, good. From here, we head
northward into the swamp. We're looking for

01:34:26.364 --> 01:34:31.483
"daggers with pearl hilts in the trees. Those are
the markers; there's six of them that lead us

01:34:31.483 --> 01:34:36.600
"there." He's going to make a perception check. He
looks a bit lost; someone want to help him out

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.583
with this?

01:34:37.583 --> 01:34:38.640
LAURA: Yeah, I'll look.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.647
MATT: Make a perception check as well.

01:34:40.647 --> 01:34:46.933
LAURA: 12, I think. Yeah.

01:34:46.933 --> 01:34:53.527
MATT: It takes you a moment, but you manage to
catch-- the third or fourth tree into the

01:34:53.527 --> 01:34:58.558
treeline, and you see a gleaming pearl-hilted
dagger that is jammed about five feet off the

01:34:58.558 --> 01:35:04.898
ground into one of the thicker pieces of tree bark
on the exterior of one of these trees. It's this

01:35:04.898 --> 01:35:09.341
little mark that looks like someone jammed a
whittling knife into it and left it there, and he

01:35:09.341 --> 01:35:12.599
goes, "That's one, good. Okay, that means we're
going the right way."

01:35:12.599 --> 01:35:14.200
LIAM: Do you see it? Show me.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:17.133
LAURA: It's right here; it's at eye level with
me.

01:35:17.133 --> 01:35:18.972
LIAM: Good.

01:35:18.972 --> 01:35:22.200
MATT: Moving up, looking for the next one. Go
ahead and roll.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:27.436
LAURA: Ooh, that's better. That's a 23.

01:35:27.436 --> 01:35:29.731
MATT: Both of you go, "There!" at the same time.

01:35:29.731 --> 01:35:31.824
MATT and LAURA: Ah! (chuckling)

01:35:31.824 --> 01:35:35.526
MATT: "All right, second one." Moving on, looking
for the third.

01:35:35.526 --> 01:35:41.075
LAURA: That was a one for me, I don't see it.

01:35:41.075 --> 01:35:49.288
MATT: This one takes a little longer to find. All
right.

01:35:49.288 --> 01:35:53.372
LAURA: But I don't wander too far from everyone
else because there's a troll out there, you guys!

01:35:53.372 --> 01:36:00.284
MATT: Yeah. You find the third, Febron finds the
fourth.

01:36:00.284 --> 01:36:03.783
LAURA: I find that last one.

01:36:03.783 --> 01:36:05.800
MATT: Fifth one because he did not find it, but
you locate it.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:06.884
LAURA: 23!

01:36:06.884 --> 01:36:15.088
MATT: Yeah. With that point, he goes, "Okay. I'm
pretty sure we're almost there." He points ahead,

01:36:15.088 --> 01:36:26.877
and you can see where there's a cluster of trees.
A new sight catches your attention. The first

01:36:26.877 --> 01:36:33.308
thing that hits you is this faint scent of rotting
flesh. It hits your nose a bit and your eyes

01:36:33.308 --> 01:36:40.541
sting, water for the moment. As your vision
focuses on the first corpse, a human man propped

01:36:40.541 --> 01:36:46.851
up on a spear going up through the side of his
torso and out his left pectoral. His stomach is

01:36:46.851 --> 01:36:56.906
bloated and his skin is dull gray and glistening.
His jaw hangs open, his expression this horrible,

01:36:56.906 --> 01:37:06.666
ghastly grimace. A few feet from him, stuck to one
of the trees, you see a halfling woman with two

01:37:06.666 --> 01:37:12.380
blades jammed through her shoulders, pinning her
up, legs dangling, but one leg is partially torn

01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:19.533
off. Her head is mounted down, hair in her face so
you can't make out any features, and they're both

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:26.308
placed up there right against this opening to a
small clearing ahead, and this is where Febron

01:37:26.308 --> 01:37:34.263
goes, "And that's what I'm talking about. That's
the warning. Whoever did this is trying to keep us out."

01:37:34.263 --> 01:37:36.758
LAURA: You haven't gone past these--

01:37:36.758 --> 01:37:38.085
MATT: "Fuck no!"

01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:46.742
LAURA: Shh! (quietly) They could be around! Hey
you guys, I could try this thing that I've been

01:37:46.818 --> 01:37:56.439
wanting to do for a while, which is where I can
talk to somebody that is not alive anymore.

01:37:56.439 --> 01:37:58.644
SAM: You can do that?

01:37:58.644 --> 01:38:03.504
LAURA: Yeah, the Traveler's teaching me all about
it and I think I can do it.

01:38:03.504 --> 01:38:06.007
MARK: Is the Traveler another wizard?

01:38:06.007 --> 01:38:12.184
LAURA: He kind of is, but he's really powerful,
and he's super cool.

01:38:12.184 --> 01:38:13.524
LIAM: Settle in.

01:38:13.524 --> 01:38:20.159
LAURA: He wears this really cool cloak, and he's
got an amazing voice. Actually, hold on! I pull

01:38:20.159 --> 01:38:25.488
out one of my pamphlets. Here, if you want to
learn more, you just let me know.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:28.917
TRAVIS: Maybe we can get back to talking to the
dead people?

01:38:28.917 --> 01:38:30.788
LAURA: Yeah, do you want me to try it?

01:38:30.788 --> 01:38:33.006
SAM: That sounds like a great idea.

01:38:33.006 --> 01:38:36.041
TALIESIN: Nott, why don't we check for traps,
too?

01:38:36.041 --> 01:38:38.263
SAM: Oh, that's my job!

01:38:38.263 --> 01:38:41.658
MARISHA: How long does it take you to talk to dead
people?

01:38:41.658 --> 01:38:46.840
LAURA: It's instantaneous, but I can talk to them
for about ten minutes or so.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:50.943
SAM: Anyone who's dead, or just one dead person?

01:38:50.943 --> 01:38:53.935
LAURA: Just one dead person that I cast it on.

01:38:53.935 --> 01:38:56.541
SAM: Which body is fresher, Matthew?

01:38:57.241 --> 01:39:00.705
MATT: From what you're looking at, they're both
about as fresh as the other.

01:39:00.705 --> 01:39:03.109
TRAVIS: Which one's got the better mouth?

01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:05.668
LAURA: It doesn't have to be fresh, it could be
really old.

01:39:05.753 --> 01:39:13.930
MATT: They both have their jaws intact. From what
you can tell, the female halfling, you can't make

01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:18.443
out the features of the face because the hair is
in the way and dangling. The other one's is open.

01:39:18.443 --> 01:39:20.362
LAURA: Which one looks friendlier?

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:24.719
MATT: They both look pretty dead!

01:39:24.719 --> 01:39:26.755
SAM: Let me check for traps on the smaller one.

01:39:26.755 --> 01:39:28.346
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:39:28.923 --> 01:39:33.539
SAM: Oh, a lot. 25.

01:39:33.539 --> 01:39:45.569
MATT: No traps, nothing like that. You do notice
there are wounds across the body. Beyond the leg

01:39:45.569 --> 01:39:51.341
missing, there are a number of wounds. You can
make a medicine check to try and ascertain what they are.

01:39:51.979 --> 01:39:53.047
SAM: Ten.

01:39:53.047 --> 01:40:01.254
MATT: Okay. They seem to be a combination of bite
and claw marks. Not super deep slashing, but

01:40:01.254 --> 01:40:08.647
definitely a gash across the shoulder, the neck.
There is one large puncture wound about that wide

01:40:08.647 --> 01:40:14.573
that's right around where the sternum is. But
whatever punctured it, one of the edges is torn

01:40:14.573 --> 01:40:22.151
out, like something hooked was placed in and then
pulled through, dragging the flesh with it.

01:40:22.151 --> 01:40:26.196
SAM: Does her face look like--

01:40:26.196 --> 01:40:27.524
MATT: Intact.

01:40:27.524 --> 01:40:29.147
SAM: Yeah, we don't know this person, right?

01:40:29.147 --> 01:40:32.600
MATT: No, you do not recognize this person,
lifeless. You do see some rough elements of

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:39.027
tattoos along the neck similar to the banded neck
tattoos of members of The Gentleman's crew that

01:40:39.027 --> 01:40:44.446
you had seen before. Not as thick and dense, but
you can see that there is a pattern to the

01:40:44.446 --> 01:40:48.813
acquisition of some of these tattoos for the ones
who run the smuggling line. You're starting to

01:40:48.813 --> 01:40:54.156
ascertain and put that together, but intact.

01:40:54.156 --> 01:40:56.630
SAM: Would you like to talk to this one?

01:40:56.630 --> 01:40:58.150
LAURA: I mean, sure.

01:40:59.310 --> 01:41:00.806
SAM: Well, let me introduce you.

01:41:00.806 --> 01:41:01.929
LAURA: Okay.

01:41:01.929 --> 01:41:03.396
SAM: This is my friend, Jester.

01:41:03.396 --> 01:41:04.368
LAURA: Hi.

01:41:04.368 --> 01:41:05.992
SAM: Jester, this is a dead body.

01:41:05.992 --> 01:41:08.033
LAURA: I'm nervous; I've never done this before.

01:41:08.033 --> 01:41:09.351
TALIESIN: This should be good.

01:41:09.351 --> 01:41:13.876
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to hold my symbol of the
Traveler.

01:41:13.876 --> 01:41:16.450
MARISHA: I'm going to keep a lookout while she
does this.

01:41:16.450 --> 01:41:18.568
LAURA: I'm going to be like, okay, I'm going to do
this thing.

01:41:18.568 --> 01:41:20.135
SAM: Just be confident.

01:41:20.135 --> 01:41:24.399
MATT: Kiri pulls a blade and gets behind Cali and
is like, (like Jester) "I've never done this before."

01:41:27.141 --> 01:41:28.695
LAURA: Kiri, be careful.

01:41:28.695 --> 01:41:30.642
MATT: (like Jester) "Be careful."

01:41:33.207 --> 01:41:39.839
LAURA: Hey, you dead person, hey. I would like if
you would come to life again a little bit and tell

01:41:39.839 --> 01:41:42.229
us some things that we want to know.

01:41:43.844 --> 01:41:45.564
(tongue waggling)

01:41:45.564 --> 01:41:46.655
(surprised yell)

01:41:46.655 --> 01:41:51.112
(screaming)

01:41:51.112 --> 01:41:57.124
MATT: You watch as a tiny dagger goes into the tree
next to it and Kiri's around Cali's going--

01:42:00.706 --> 01:42:02.619
TRAVIS: Easy, Kiri, easy. Settle, settle.

01:42:02.619 --> 01:42:04.292
MATT: (cawing, whimpering)

01:42:04.292 --> 01:42:06.686
MARK: Yeah, Kiri settle.

01:42:09.322 --> 01:42:15.541
MATT: As the chest breathes in, some of the air
escapes some of the wounds, and there's bits of matter-

01:42:15.541 --> 01:42:18.724
MARK: (retching)

01:42:19.106 --> 01:42:22.629
MATT: The head settles down and looks right--

01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:24.754
MARISHA: Yasha and her gag reflex.

01:42:24.754 --> 01:42:28.234
ASHLEY: Oh no, it's happening again. It feels like
it's coming up.

01:42:29.494 --> 01:42:34.094
MATT: Febron leaps back, he's like, "Shit!", and
backs up a little bit. He looks really

01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:39.409
uncomfortable with this whole thing. You don't
think he was prepared for any sort of dead-raising

01:42:39.409 --> 01:42:43.650
circumstance. "Is this fucking necromancy?!"

01:42:43.650 --> 01:42:45.775
LAURA: Well, kind of!

01:42:45.775 --> 01:42:51.120
MATT: He keeps backing away. Now the corpse's face
of this halfling woman turns towards you.

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.756
(inhaling)

01:42:52.756 --> 01:42:56.908
LAURA: (tongue waggling) We have to ask it some
questions.

01:42:57.726 --> 01:43:00.601
(low monotone) What did this to you?

01:43:00.601 --> 01:43:03.108
SAM: I don't think you have to talk like you're
dead.

01:43:03.108 --> 01:43:05.498
LAURA: Really, are you sure though? Have you ever
talked to a dead person?

01:43:05.498 --> 01:43:08.271
SAM: I've never done it, you know more about this
than me.

01:43:08.271 --> 01:43:14.259
MATT: (whispered voice) "Swamp fishmen
from under the ground."

01:43:14.259 --> 01:43:16.244
LAURA: Beau, are you writing this down?

01:43:16.244 --> 01:43:17.918
MARISHA: Swamp fishman from underground.

01:43:18.033 --> 01:43:20.658
MARK: That is incredibly specific and really
useful.

01:43:20.658 --> 01:43:24.206
(laughter)

01:43:27.894 --> 01:43:30.941
LAURA: How many swamp fishmen?

01:43:30.941 --> 01:43:32.746
MATT: "Many."

01:43:32.746 --> 01:43:35.068
LAURA: Many, there're lots of them. There're lots
of them that attacked.

01:43:35.068 --> 01:43:36.502
SAM: Where? When?

01:43:36.502 --> 01:43:38.724
LAURA: How long ago did this happen to you?

01:43:38.724 --> 01:43:40.359
SAM: How many questions do you get?

01:43:40.466 --> 01:43:42.032
LAURA: I get five of them.

01:43:42.032 --> 01:43:44.361
MATT: "Weeks. Two, maybe three."

01:43:44.361 --> 01:43:51.724
LAURA: Wow. Two or three weeks ago. Oh! Did
anything that you did to the fishmen seem to hurt

01:43:51.724 --> 01:43:54.471
them more than other things?

01:43:54.471 --> 01:43:56.211
SAM: (spookily) Ooh.

01:43:56.211 --> 01:44:02.435
MATT: "We cut when we could. They bleed, but too
many."

01:44:02.435 --> 01:44:05.300
LAURA: They bleed, but there's too many bleeds.

01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:08.800
MARK: If it bleeds, we can kill them.

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:11.867
MARISHA: So when you cut it, it bleeds. Got it.

01:44:11.867 --> 01:44:13.549
SAM: One more question.

01:44:13.549 --> 01:44:15.019
LAURA: I get one more question, what should I
ask?

01:44:15.019 --> 01:44:17.938
MATT: Kiri comes up and grabs the dagger, wedges
it out of the tree and turns to Cali and goes,

01:44:17.938 --> 01:44:23.399
(like Cali) "If it bleeds, we can kill it." Points
it back to the corpse.

01:44:23.522 --> 01:44:28.439
LAURA: Don't kill it again, okay Kiri? It's okay.
We have another question.

01:44:28.439 --> 01:44:31.972
SAM: Either where this happened or where they were
hiding?

01:44:31.972 --> 01:44:34.579
TALIESIN: Where did it happen, inside? Or where
did they come from?

01:44:34.579 --> 01:44:35.612
TRAVIS: Underground.

01:44:35.612 --> 01:44:40.018
TALIESIN: But did they come from the house, or
from outside the safe house, or inside?

01:44:40.018 --> 01:44:44.085
MARK: Could you word it in a way where you ask all
of those in one question, like, "Did you come from

01:44:44.085 --> 01:44:46.842
this, this, or this?" maybe, and then we'll know
where?

01:44:46.842 --> 01:44:52.007
SAM: Or, we could ask if there's a secret entrance
to the safe house.

01:44:52.007 --> 01:44:54.265
TALIESIN: What if there isn't?

01:44:54.265 --> 01:44:56.671
SAM: Then we've wasted a question.

01:44:56.671 --> 01:44:57.689
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:44:57.689 --> 01:44:59.966
MARK: But we know there's not a secret entrance.

01:44:59.966 --> 01:45:01.998
TRAVIS: Did any of it precede the attack?

01:45:01.998 --> 01:45:04.715
LAURA: Or we could ask it what its childhood was
like.

01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:11.948
SAM: That would be an interesting story. I'm going
to check behind us and see how far back Fermaw,

01:45:11.948 --> 01:45:13.902
what's his name, Febron?

01:45:13.902 --> 01:45:15.021
MATT: Febron?

01:45:15.021 --> 01:45:17.782
SAM: How far back has Febron gone?

01:45:17.782 --> 01:45:21.667
MATT: He's 20 feet behind you. He's keeping a
little back from the whole undead thing.

01:45:21.667 --> 01:45:25.561
SAM: Hey, Febron! Don't go too far. There's a
troll back there.

01:45:25.561 --> 01:45:31.417
MATT: At which point, from behind one of the trees
(growling), the troll reaches out and grabs him by

01:45:31.417 --> 01:45:38.045
the torso, pulls him back, and you hear him scream
as the troll grabs him, tucks him under his arm,

01:45:38.045 --> 01:45:41.394
(snarling) and begins leaping away from you.

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.059
LIAM: Magic Missile!

01:45:43.059 --> 01:45:45.501
MATT: Okay, go for it. Make an attack.

01:45:45.501 --> 01:45:46.603
ASHLEY: I go running.

01:45:46.603 --> 01:45:47.500
MATT: You go running.

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:50.053
SAM: I miss. I got a nine.

01:45:50.053 --> 01:45:52.878
MARISHA: Almost made a bet if Febron was going to
make it.

01:45:52.878 --> 01:45:57.127
MARK: Acid Splash. Cali's going to spit a glob of
acid.

01:45:57.127 --> 01:45:59.545
MATT: (splashes) All righty.

01:45:59.545 --> 01:46:01.226
TALIESIN: Oh no. Wait. Come back.

01:46:01.226 --> 01:46:03.319
LIAM: I'm going to cast at 2nd-level.

01:46:03.319 --> 01:46:06.723
MARISHA: Yeah. Oh no, man, oh no.

01:46:06.723 --> 01:46:08.163
MATT: Let me get the--

01:46:08.163 --> 01:46:09.899
ASHLEY: Wait, did we already give him the 100
gold?

01:46:09.899 --> 01:46:10.789
SAM: Yes.

01:46:10.789 --> 01:46:12.257
ASHLEY: We're going to give him at the end,
right?

01:46:12.379 --> 01:46:14.051
SAM: No, we gave it to him already.

01:46:14.051 --> 01:46:15.378
ASHLEY: We gave him half?

01:46:15.378 --> 01:46:18.358
TALIESIN: We're going to loot the corpse anyway.
We know where that money's going.

01:46:18.358 --> 01:46:21.171
MARISHA: He did his job, though. He got us here.

01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:23.245
TALIESIN: We're going to go find it in the tree
later. It'll be fine.

01:46:23.245 --> 01:46:25.476
ASHLEY: If he dies, we can get the money back.

01:46:25.476 --> 01:46:28.087
LAURA: Don't waste all your spells, you've got to
fight fish men!

01:46:28.087 --> 01:46:30.336
TALIESIN: It's practically going to be in a safety
deposit box.

01:46:30.336 --> 01:46:32.128
MARISHA: Hold this for us.

01:46:32.568 --> 01:46:35.288
TRAVIS: He's fucking huge!

01:46:35.501 --> 01:46:37.617
MATT: That is the troll.

01:46:37.617 --> 01:46:40.133
TRAVIS: I thought he was humanoid-sized!

01:46:40.133 --> 01:46:41.701
LAURA: Oh, he's huge!

01:46:41.701 --> 01:46:43.520
MARISHA: Look, he tucked Febron under his arm.

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:46.694
TRAVIS: Why did you go try to be friends with
that? What are you thinking?

01:46:46.694 --> 01:46:48.736
ASHLEY: I didn't know he was that big!

01:46:48.736 --> 01:46:52.529
MATT: This is the opening of the clearing here,
where you guys were talking to the halfling that

01:46:52.529 --> 01:46:55.225
was stapled to the tree right there.

01:46:55.225 --> 01:46:56.814
LAURA: Just stapled to the tree.

01:46:56.814 --> 01:47:03.120
MATT: Essentially, yeah. You guys all spin and
watch this happening. Kiri's over by the edge of

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.658
the tree with you, and Caleb, where were you?

01:47:05.658 --> 01:47:10.412
LIAM: Towards the back of the group, never near
the front.

01:47:10.412 --> 01:47:13.135
MATT: You would have probably been over here, near
Nott.

01:47:13.135 --> 01:47:15.365
TRAVIS: This is north, towards me?

01:47:15.365 --> 01:47:16.895
MATT: Technically, this would be north.

01:47:16.895 --> 01:47:17.971
LAURA: Technically!

01:47:17.971 --> 01:47:19.836
MATT: Yes, that area's north.

01:47:19.836 --> 01:47:22.632
SAM: I fired a shot that missed.

01:47:22.632 --> 01:47:23.921
MATT: Yes. What did you roll?

01:47:23.921 --> 01:47:25.042
SAM: A nine.

01:47:25.042 --> 01:47:26.195
MATT: That did miss.

01:47:26.195 --> 01:47:30.227
LIAM: Magic Missile, level two, four darts, total
of 16 force damage.

01:47:30.227 --> 01:47:31.934
MATT: Nice.

01:47:31.934 --> 01:47:37.619
MARK: Reflex save-- Dexterity. Dexterity saving
throw for the Acid Splash.

01:47:37.619 --> 01:47:45.503
MATT: The troll spins and goes running with Febron
going (screaming) in its grasp, it starts

01:47:45.503 --> 01:47:52.305
lumbering, leaping from tree to tree. Its legs,
while it has this bulbous, swollen midsection,

01:47:52.305 --> 01:47:56.690
these thin frog-like legs are giving these fairly
decent leaps from section to section, its other

01:47:56.690 --> 01:48:01.469
arm grasping onto the trees as it runs. You can
see this is definitely its home terrain. As these

01:48:01.469 --> 01:48:09.529
magic missiles swarm out and slam into its body,
with each impact, that green ichor sprays across

01:48:09.529 --> 01:48:14.983
Febron, and it starts to burn into his skin. He's
(screaming).

01:48:14.983 --> 01:48:16.932
TRAVIS: Xenomorph blood.

01:48:16.932 --> 01:48:18.768
LAURA: Oh no!

01:48:22.188 --> 01:48:24.908
TRAVIS: Is he unconscious? Is he done? Is that
it?

01:48:24.917 --> 01:48:26.241
MATT: Febron goes limp--

01:48:26.241 --> 01:48:28.903
(cheering and groaning)

01:48:29.184 --> 01:48:36.971
MATT: I rolled 2d8. I rolled eight on each of
them. That was the reaction there.

01:48:37.396 --> 01:48:40.396
MARK: Dexterity saving throw for the Acid Splash
as well, if you don't mind.

01:48:40.396 --> 01:48:41.994
MATT: Correct. That's a four.

01:48:41.994 --> 01:48:43.062
MARK: Seven.

01:48:43.062 --> 01:48:48.971
MATT: Seven points of acid, got it. As it slams,
it begins to burn the back of the skin. You watch

01:48:48.971 --> 01:48:53.976
a bit of steam rise off of its shoulder. It
definitely is wounding the creature. This large,

01:48:53.976 --> 01:48:58.174
swollen troll is still making a break. I need
everyone to roll initiative now.

01:49:02.317 --> 01:49:04.263
LIAM: Don't fuck me, Matt Mercer.

01:49:04.263 --> 01:49:06.355
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

01:49:08.052 --> 01:49:09.472
MATT: 25 to 20?

01:49:09.472 --> 01:49:10.537
LAURA: 23.

01:49:10.537 --> 01:49:11.441
MARK: 20.

01:49:11.441 --> 01:49:14.240
MARISHA: Actually, I'm going to blow my d8. Ooh,
that's an eight.

01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.505
TRAVIS: Jester and Cali?

01:49:16.505 --> 01:49:18.062
MATT: 20 to 15?

01:49:18.062 --> 01:49:19.615
SAM: 18.

01:49:19.615 --> 01:49:20.980
TALIESIN: 16.

01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:23.795
MATT: Nott and Molly. 15 to ten?

01:49:23.795 --> 01:49:24.867
MARISHA: 14.

01:49:24.867 --> 01:49:27.190
TRAVIS: 14 as well.

01:49:27.950 --> 01:49:29.872
LIAM: Did you speak up yet?

01:49:30.038 --> 01:49:31.151
ASHLEY: Nope.

01:49:31.151 --> 01:49:33.210
LIAM: Of course you didn't.

01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:34.440
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:35.795
MATT: Ten to five?

01:49:35.795 --> 01:49:38.336
ASHLEY: Six. Every time!

01:49:38.336 --> 01:49:39.887
MATT: Eight?

01:49:39.887 --> 01:49:41.353
TALIESIN: It's magic.

01:49:41.353 --> 01:49:42.935
MATT: Ashley, it's incredible.

01:49:42.935 --> 01:49:48.272
ASHLEY: It really is. I have a plus two in this
campaign, also. Good grief.

01:49:48.272 --> 01:49:55.903
MATT: Is that everybody? I think so, yeah. Top of
the round, as it's bounding behind with an

01:49:55.903 --> 01:50:01.574
unconscious guide under its arm, Jester, you're up
first.

01:50:01.574 --> 01:50:04.882
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to Toll the Dead because
he's been injured.

01:50:04.882 --> 01:50:06.825
MATT: All righty.

01:50:06.825 --> 01:50:08.937
LAURA: I'm going to turn around and be like
(splat).

01:50:08.937 --> 01:50:10.629
MATT: What type of damage is it?

01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:13.998
LAURA: It is necrotic damage, but he has to roll a
wisdom saving throw.

01:50:13.998 --> 01:50:15.964
MATT: Which he does not make, he rolled a 12.

01:50:15.964 --> 01:50:20.520
LAURA: So 2d12! I can help search for those in a
second--

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.283
SAM: No, I got them.

01:50:24.319 --> 01:50:26.159
LAURA: Six whole points!

01:50:26.159 --> 01:50:32.201
MATT: Six points of damage. As the energy
coalesces and the bell, (impact) in the range of

01:50:32.201 --> 01:50:38.568
this creature, it impacts it and it staggers for a
second, and the pustules on its body emit more of

01:50:38.568 --> 01:50:40.432
that poison.

01:50:40.432 --> 01:50:44.104
LAURA: He has a loud ringing in his ears, damn
it.

01:50:44.104 --> 01:50:47.465
MATT: That finishes your go. Cali, you're up.

01:50:47.465 --> 01:50:52.135
MARK: Okay, so, seeing everything go on, and the
combat erupt, you see her twitch a little bit, and

01:50:52.135 --> 01:51:00.343
she snarls a little. I'm going to rush up 30 feet,
move up as much as I can. Get back here, now! I'm

01:51:00.343 --> 01:51:05.804
going to Quickened Spell, False Life on myself--
actually, no, I'll just do it as a normal action,

01:51:05.804 --> 01:51:11.550
I won't Quickened Spell it. I'll do False Life on
myself and gain some vigor, as a 1st-level spell.

01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:13.279
SAM: All words I've never heard before.

01:51:13.279 --> 01:51:14.791
ASHLEY: Same!

01:51:14.791 --> 01:51:20.202
MARK: I gain seven temporary hit points, and then
I'm going to-- well, that's it. Yeah.

01:51:20.202 --> 01:51:27.168
MATT: Cool. This strange barrier of arcane energy
forms around Cali's body, giving this little

01:51:27.168 --> 01:51:32.646
essence of vigor, and the body swells a bit. That
finishes your turn. Nott, you're up.

01:51:32.646 --> 01:51:42.221
SAM: I'll get within 30 feet. Fire a crossbow shot
towards its foot.

01:51:42.221 --> 01:51:45.252
MATT: Within 30 feet, you can stop about there.

01:51:45.252 --> 01:51:46.512
SAM: That's good.

01:51:46.512 --> 01:51:47.998
MATT: Go for it.

01:51:47.998 --> 01:51:49.921
SAM: It hits, probably. 24?

01:51:49.921 --> 01:51:51.573
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

01:51:51.573 --> 01:51:54.718
SAM: Sneak attack? No.

01:51:54.718 --> 01:51:59.200
MATT: Technically, no, because he's aware that you
were there, and is not currently flanked by any allies.

01:51:59.875 --> 01:52:01.647
LAURA: Not flanked by Febron.

01:52:01.647 --> 01:52:03.797
SAM: Oh, terrible. Five points.

01:52:03.797 --> 01:52:09.530
MATT: Five points of piercing damage. It strikes
and sticks into the back, and more of that green

01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:15.909
stuff begins to spray out of the wound where it
hit in the vicinity. It's creating bursts of this

01:52:15.909 --> 01:52:21.517
toxic sludge that's oozing from its body around it
each time you're hitting it.

01:52:21.517 --> 01:52:25.550
SAM: I'll shoot again, with bonus action. Ooh,
that's not as good. 13?

01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:31.841
MATT: 13? That does not hit. It manages to hit the
tree that's near it and sticking into that one, there.

01:52:32.003 --> 01:52:37.069
SAM: I'll use the rest of my movement to duck
behind a tree or something while I scream.

01:52:37.069 --> 01:52:41.475
LAURA: I wonder if Febron is going to get covered
in that pus that's coming out of him.

01:52:41.475 --> 01:52:43.585
MATT: There's quite a bit of it on Febron,
actually.

01:52:43.585 --> 01:52:45.020
LIAM: Are we in difficult terrain here?

01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:46.004
MATT: Yes, you are.

01:52:46.004 --> 01:52:47.698
MARISHA: Green stuff should sponsor us.

01:52:47.698 --> 01:52:54.793
MATT: I'd say in this clearing you're not in
terribly difficult terrain. You're moving around

01:52:54.793 --> 01:52:59.108
okay, it's not too bad. The further you get into
it this way, it starts getting a little more--

01:52:59.108 --> 01:53:02.516
like in the cluster of trees in here, it starts
getting a harder to move in.

01:53:02.516 --> 01:53:04.863
LIAM: Although, you've got your shoes on, yeah?

01:53:04.863 --> 01:53:06.623
LAURA: The ring.

01:53:06.623 --> 01:53:09.090
MATT: That ends Nott's turn. Molly, you're up.

01:53:09.090 --> 01:53:11.602
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast Enthrall.

01:53:11.602 --> 01:53:18.196
MATT: Okay. That is a 14. What is it, wisdom?

01:53:18.196 --> 01:53:20.677
TALIESIN: I don't know. Yes, I believe it's a
wisdom--

01:53:20.677 --> 01:53:24.912
MATT: 13. Your DC on that is? It's charisma-based,
right? This is your racial?

01:53:24.912 --> 01:53:26.606
TALIESIN: Yeah, it is racial.

01:53:26.606 --> 01:53:30.610
MATT: It succeeds, it's a ten. Unfortunately! That
would have stopped it in its tracks.

01:53:30.610 --> 01:53:32.940
TALIESIN: (groaning mumbles)

01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:34.038
MARISHA: That was Molly?

01:53:34.038 --> 01:53:35.478
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:53:35.478 --> 01:53:37.929
MATT: Is that your turn? Do you want to move
closer?

01:53:38.086 --> 01:53:40.560
TALIESIN: I'll move up to that tree.

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:42.365
MATT: Okay, so you move up to there.

01:53:42.365 --> 01:53:44.395
TALIESIN: As a bonus, I'll-- no, I'll hold off.

01:53:44.395 --> 01:53:48.395
MATT: Okay, that finishes Molly's go. Beau and
Fjord, you guys are up.

01:53:48.395 --> 01:53:51.861
MARISHA: I think I'm 40 feet within him. If you do
it--

01:53:51.861 --> 01:53:54.511
LAURA: You're 40 feet within him?

01:53:54.511 --> 01:53:58.089
MATT: (counting) You do, you get right up into its
body.

01:53:58.089 --> 01:54:08.621
MARISHA: Hey, so deep! Okay, I'm going to pop pop.
My two strikes-- oh, wait, that's a die damage.

01:54:08.621 --> 01:54:15.065
First two strikes! First one is a 21, second one
is a 16?

01:54:15.065 --> 01:54:16.645
MATT: They both hit.

01:54:16.645 --> 01:54:26.028
MARISHA: Okay! Damn it, I rolled a one, this
sucks. 12 damage for the first one, seven damage

01:54:26.028 --> 01:54:27.408
for the second one.

01:54:27.408 --> 01:54:28.876
MATT: Great.

01:54:28.876 --> 01:54:29.915
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:54:29.915 --> 01:54:31.455
MATT: What else are you doing?

01:54:31.455 --> 01:54:35.301
MARISHA: I'm going to use a ki point to do
stunning strike.

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:37.737
MATT: Oh, nice.

01:54:37.737 --> 01:54:40.773
MARISHA: Stunning strike!

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:43.591
MATT: All right. 21.

01:54:43.591 --> 01:54:44.896
MARISHA: Fuck.

01:54:44.896 --> 01:54:52.597
MATT: That is a plus five on its constitution
saving throw. Trolls, man. It resists the stunning strike.

01:54:52.921 --> 01:54:54.308
MARISHA: That's good to know.

01:54:54.308 --> 01:54:55.629
MATT: You still have your bonus, though.

01:54:55.629 --> 01:55:00.266
MARISHA: I still have my bonus. I'll just punch
him in the face.

01:55:00.266 --> 01:55:02.971
LAURA: Please don't waste all your stuff on this
guy, because, you know--

01:55:02.971 --> 01:55:09.455
MARISHA: Because we might still fight all those
things. Nine damage. No, sorry, ten damage.

01:55:09.455 --> 01:55:11.288
MATT: Ten damage. Third strike?

01:55:11.288 --> 01:55:13.159
MARISHA: That was it.

01:55:13.159 --> 01:55:19.915
MATT: Okay, cool. You rush forward, slamming into
it with your staff and your fists, striking into

01:55:19.915 --> 01:55:25.985
its body. With each impact, it takes you a moment
to realize what's happening, but that spray is

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:30.218
covering your face, and as it does, the venom is
pushing into your flesh and burning upon contact.

01:55:30.301 --> 01:55:33.550
MARISHA: You guys, it makes your throat a little
numb!

01:55:34.517 --> 01:55:40.578
MATT: You take nine points of poison damage. You
take another nine points of poison damage. You

01:55:40.578 --> 01:55:49.506
take 15 points of poison damage. A total of--
sorry, 15, nine and nine, so that's 34? 34 points

01:55:49.506 --> 01:55:51.040
of poison damage.

01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:51.764
TRAVIS: 33.

01:55:51.764 --> 01:55:53.496
MATT: 33, sorry.

01:55:53.496 --> 01:55:56.673
LAURA: Y'all, don't get close to this guy, because
I don't want to waste all my--

01:55:56.673 --> 01:56:01.500
MATT: Febron, by the way? Fucking dead. You see
now he's coated in this toxin. The eyes are open

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:09.216
and now pouring out of his mouth is foam at the
edge with his tongue lolling out. Yeah, as it was

01:56:09.216 --> 01:56:14.955
fleeing, all the impacts covered him with the same
toxic stuff and sent him straight to his grave.

01:56:14.955 --> 01:56:17.428
MARISHA: Guys, our money's getting away!

01:56:17.428 --> 01:56:22.460
LAURA: I think it's okay because I'm going to have
to use all my fucking spells healing you, Beau!

01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:23.738
MARISHA: I'm okay!

01:56:23.738 --> 01:56:25.367
LAURA: Why don't you get back here?

01:56:25.367 --> 01:56:27.021
MATT: That ends Beau's turn. Fjord, what are you
doing?

01:56:27.021 --> 01:56:34.540
TRAVIS: Can I move 15 feet towards the troll? I'll
see the gore and poison splattering all over Beau

01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:40.034
and little sizzles coming up and shit, and I'm
like: Eh, Eldritch Blast!

01:56:40.034 --> 01:56:45.071
MARISHA: I turn around to you and I go (gasping
and groaning).

01:56:45.071 --> 01:56:47.445
TRAVIS: (screams, blasts)

01:56:47.445 --> 01:56:49.266
MATT: All right. Two attacks on it.

01:56:49.266 --> 01:56:50.725
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh, that's 26 to hit.

01:56:50.725 --> 01:56:52.343
MATT: That hits.

01:56:52.343 --> 01:56:53.880
TRAVIS: And 25 to hit.

01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.290
MATT: Both hit.

01:56:55.290 --> 01:57:02.982
TRAVIS: Those were monsters, jeez. 1d10 plus four,
that's eight points on the first one, and that's

01:57:02.982 --> 01:57:05.505
14 points on the second one.

01:57:05.505 --> 01:57:11.507
MATT: Woo, nice! Both parts of its back where they
impact, the flesh tears open, revealing the muscle

01:57:11.507 --> 01:57:15.368
beneath, and as it does, more of it sprays.
Beau--

01:57:15.368 --> 01:57:16.579
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, right!

01:57:16.579 --> 01:57:18.701
MATT: You take five points of poison damage.

01:57:18.701 --> 01:57:22.612
MARISHA: Hang on, let me make sure I'm doing my
math right, too. It was 33 points of damage is

01:57:22.612 --> 01:57:23.639
what you did before, right?

01:57:23.639 --> 01:57:24.526
MATT: Correct.

01:57:24.526 --> 01:57:25.615
LAURA: 34.

01:57:25.615 --> 01:57:27.166
TRAVIS: 33.

01:57:27.166 --> 01:57:29.950
MATT: It was 15 plus 18, so it's 33.

01:57:29.950 --> 01:57:32.001
MARISHA: Okay, and then--

01:57:32.001 --> 01:57:34.453
MATT: You just took another 20 points of poison
damage.

01:57:34.453 --> 01:57:36.107
MARISHA: I am unconscious.

01:57:36.107 --> 01:57:40.992
SAM: What?! Way to go, Mee-ster Fjord.

01:57:40.992 --> 01:57:42.993
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't anybody else hit it.

01:57:42.993 --> 01:57:44.957
LAURA: Oh god, please don't pick up Beau.

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:54.399
MATT: Beau falls onto the ground, arms limp,
covered in this toxic substance. That ends your

01:57:54.399 --> 01:57:55.935
turn, Fjord?

01:57:55.935 --> 01:57:58.394
TRAVIS: Yeah, I cast Regret.

01:57:58.394 --> 01:58:00.264
(laughing)

01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:02.300
MARK: I cast Major Regret at 5th-level.

01:58:03.230 --> 01:58:07.164
MATT: Okay, so it is now the troll's turn. The
troll does not regenerate because you did acid

01:58:07.164 --> 01:58:10.086
damage to it with your last attack, which prevents
it from regaining any hit points.

01:58:10.086 --> 01:58:12.640
MARK: That was not me meta-gaming, chat.

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:18.987
MATT: However, it's still currently clutching the
body of Febron under its arm. It's going for a

01:58:18.987 --> 01:58:24.252
straight bolt, it looks down and sees Beau
unconscious, uses its action to pick Beau up under

01:58:24.252 --> 01:58:25.836
the other arm--

01:58:25.836 --> 01:58:28.493
LAURA: No! Goddamn it.

01:58:28.493 --> 01:58:31.203
MARK: It doesn't have to move to do it, does it?

01:58:31.203 --> 01:58:39.196
MATT: Nope. Now it's going to use its full
movement. That's 30, it is right where the marker

01:58:39.196 --> 01:58:40.987
is right there.

01:58:40.987 --> 01:58:43.497
LAURA: --without killing Beau, because we can't
attack it?

01:58:43.497 --> 01:58:46.946
SAM: We have to stop it with magic, or nets.

01:58:46.946 --> 01:58:49.433
MARISHA: Anyone have a Hold Monster situation?

01:58:49.433 --> 01:58:52.045
MATT: Yeah, this is a pickle, guys.

01:58:52.045 --> 01:58:55.411
TRAVIS: You didn't really like that character that
much, did you?

01:58:55.411 --> 01:58:57.132
MARISHA: You know!

01:58:57.132 --> 01:59:00.044
MATT: That ends the troll's turn. Caleb, you're
up.

01:59:00.044 --> 01:59:02.174
MARISHA: Haven't even gotten her backstory yet.

01:59:02.174 --> 01:59:05.668
LIAM: I will use my movement first. I want to get
as close as I can, which is 15 feet-- or, no, you

01:59:05.668 --> 01:59:07.577
said the closer we get?

01:59:07.577 --> 01:59:10.566
MATT: Right there is when you start getting to
rough terrain, so that's as far as you get-- which

01:59:10.566 --> 01:59:14.619
the troll is not affected by, you've noticed that
it's in its home turf.

01:59:14.619 --> 01:59:20.491
LIAM: Yeah, you know, I went through a whole range
of emotions because first I was going to try to

01:59:20.491 --> 01:59:25.000
hold it, but then the guy was dead, so I was like
fuck it, I'll switch to a Fire Bolt, but then he

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:32.653
grabbed Beau, so I am going to use the Glove of
Blasting and cast Scorching Ray on it, because I

01:59:32.653 --> 01:59:34.235
can't reach for anything better.

01:59:34.235 --> 01:59:36.952
LAURA: No, but what if it makes it pus its thing
and then it hits Beau and she dies?!

01:59:36.952 --> 01:59:39.432
MARK: Every time it gets hit, even by spells.

01:59:39.432 --> 01:59:40.810
LAURA: Don't damage it!

01:59:40.810 --> 01:59:41.902
LIAM: Yeah?

01:59:41.902 --> 01:59:43.827
TRAVIS: That's what happened to Febron.

01:59:43.827 --> 01:59:45.289
MARISHA: We need like a hold thing--

01:59:45.289 --> 01:59:46.400
LIAM: I don't have that.

01:59:46.610 --> 01:59:49.452
TRAVIS: I don't either. I mean, I got something
that holds, but it damages, too.

01:59:49.452 --> 01:59:51.593
MATT: What are you doing, Caleb?

01:59:51.593 --> 01:59:54.710
LIAM: I'm going to cast Magic Missile on its
head.

01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:56.784
MATT: Magic Missile on its head?

01:59:56.784 --> 01:59:58.368
LIAM: Yeah.

01:59:58.368 --> 02:00:00.801
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for the damage on
that.

02:00:00.801 --> 02:00:02.872
SAM: Beau dies.

02:00:02.872 --> 02:00:11.190
LIAM: No, I'm going to cast-- fucksticks. I'm
going to cast Haste on Nott. That's what I do.

02:00:11.328 --> 02:00:19.166
MATT: Okay. You are now holding concentration on
Haste. Nott, you feel suddenly the world slows

02:00:19.166 --> 02:00:23.202
ever so slightly and you feel this burst of
adrenaline in your body.

02:00:31.015 --> 02:00:33.084
LAURA: Do you have a healing potion?

02:00:33.084 --> 02:00:34.421
SAM: No.

02:00:34.421 --> 02:00:36.702
MATT: That's your turn.

02:00:36.702 --> 02:00:38.060
MARISHA: I do.

02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:39.705
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

02:00:39.705 --> 02:00:45.539
ASHLEY: Okay. How close can I get?

02:00:46.729 --> 02:00:50.466
MARISHA: Man, I was hoping to stun it, guys, I'm
sorry.

02:00:50.656 --> 02:00:52.928
TALIESIN: It was a good plan.

02:00:52.928 --> 02:00:55.704
ASHLEY: Fuck, that's not going to work.

02:00:55.704 --> 02:00:57.407
SAM: Caleb?

02:00:57.407 --> 02:01:01.698
LIAM: Yeah. Your AC is up, an extra action.

02:01:01.698 --> 02:01:13.730
ASHLEY: All right, well, I would like to rage. I'm
going to scream out, in a super intimidating voice.

02:01:15.295 --> 02:01:18.935
MATT: Don't forget, if you rage and don't attack
or are attacked by the end of your next turn, you

02:01:18.935 --> 02:01:20.447
lose your rage.

02:01:20.447 --> 02:01:21.523
ASHLEY: Oh shit.

02:01:21.523 --> 02:01:23.337
MATT: So if you're not planning to attack it, or
if there's not going to be something attacking

02:01:23.337 --> 02:01:26.774
you, you're losing a rage for the day, so keep
that in mind.

02:01:26.774 --> 02:01:29.779
MARK: You just need to take damage, like get hit
by something.

02:01:29.779 --> 02:01:34.536
MATT: It's either attack or be attacked, you don't
have to take damage necessarily.

02:01:34.536 --> 02:01:37.039
TALIESIN: The acid will do full damage.

02:01:37.039 --> 02:01:39.978
SAM: Pus flew out of it.

02:01:39.978 --> 02:01:42.507
MARISHA: I'm sweating.

02:01:42.507 --> 02:01:44.709
ASHLEY: Oh my god, you're amazing.

02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:47.065
MARISHA: Sorry, audience.

02:01:47.065 --> 02:01:50.713
MATT: So it's taking damage. So it's you attacking
or taking damage.

02:01:50.713 --> 02:01:55.333
ASHLEY: Okay, fuck. Shit. Okay. Well, I'm not
going to take it back.

02:01:55.333 --> 02:01:58.227
LAURA: Can you just grapple it?

02:01:58.227 --> 02:02:00.705
ASHLEY: That's as far as I can go.

02:02:00.705 --> 02:02:02.910
MATT: Yeah. Unfortunately, you're starting to get
through some sludge.

02:02:02.910 --> 02:02:05.190
TALIESIN: You can dash and burn your action.

02:02:05.190 --> 02:02:06.358
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:02:06.358 --> 02:02:07.650
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do that.

02:02:07.650 --> 02:02:09.093
MATT: All right.

02:02:09.093 --> 02:02:10.638
MARISHA: You guys know where he's taking me.

02:02:10.638 --> 02:02:12.275
LAURA: Potentially.

02:02:12.275 --> 02:02:13.960
MATT: That's as close as you can get right there.

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:15.279
ASHLEY: Am I within ten feet of it?

02:02:15.279 --> 02:02:16.547
MATT: You are.

02:02:16.547 --> 02:02:26.163
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I use necrotic shroud, then, if
I use that as the action to run?

02:02:26.163 --> 02:02:29.224
MATT: You don't have an action to use it anymore,
unfortunately.

02:02:29.224 --> 02:02:30.689
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I just yell at it?

02:02:30.689 --> 02:02:34.387
MATT: Yeah. What do you yell? I give you two bonus
actions.

02:02:34.387 --> 02:02:39.990
ASHLEY: Super intimidating. Oh, but then I've got
to fucking attack something. All right, I'm going

02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:43.374
to be super intimidating and say: Drop it!

02:02:43.374 --> 02:02:45.113
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:02:45.113 --> 02:02:46.401
TRAVIS: No!

02:02:46.401 --> 02:02:48.084
MARK: No! I said no!

02:02:48.084 --> 02:02:49.065
MARISHA: Roll a 20.

02:02:49.065 --> 02:02:51.570
LAURA: 20! Oh, so close!

02:02:53.730 --> 02:02:58.912
ASHLEY: Okay, that's intimidation. Intimidation is
minus two.

02:02:59.049 --> 02:03:00.204
TRAVIS: How?

02:03:00.204 --> 02:03:02.031
ASHLEY: I look so mean because my charisma's so
low.

02:03:02.031 --> 02:03:04.383
MATT: Well, it's charisma-based, but depending on
the intimidation, you can use your strength

02:03:04.383 --> 02:03:05.887
modifier instead.

02:03:05.887 --> 02:03:07.446
ASHLEY: 17.

02:03:07.446 --> 02:03:09.355
MATT: Okay, with your strength modifier?

02:03:09.355 --> 02:03:11.022
TALIESIN: No, without the strength modifier.

02:03:11.022 --> 02:03:12.354
TRAVIS: You can use your str--

02:03:12.354 --> 02:03:13.824
ASHLEY: Oh I can use my strength!

02:03:13.824 --> 02:03:19.416
MATT: It makes sense, and it's how we did it in
the last campaign, too. It's one of the rules that

02:03:19.416 --> 02:03:22.966
they say you can use for your campaign. Charisma
or strength for your intimidation because it makes

02:03:22.966 --> 02:03:24.309
sense for you.

02:03:24.309 --> 02:03:26.631
ASHLEY: Oh yes, okay! Okay, okay, okay!

02:03:26.631 --> 02:03:30.422
MATT: My favorite Pike line, by the way, in
Pillars Of Eternity.

02:03:30.422 --> 02:03:32.168
MARISHA: I was just thinking that as well!

02:03:32.168 --> 02:03:34.090
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:03:34.090 --> 02:03:35.441
ASHLEY: Okay! 22!

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:37.258
MATT: 22, all right.

02:03:37.258 --> 02:03:39.287
MARISHA: I died when I heard that.

02:03:39.287 --> 02:03:45.245
MATT: Okay, it turns around and glances at you and
it looks shaken. I'll say, for the purposes of

02:03:45.245 --> 02:03:48.624
this, it's frightened of you until the end of your
next turn.

02:03:48.624 --> 02:03:51.026
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:03:51.026 --> 02:03:53.526
LAURA: It's going to keep running away from you.

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:54.573
MATT: Yeah.

02:03:54.573 --> 02:03:56.288
LIAM: It's all happening like this.

02:03:56.288 --> 02:03:57.957
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Yasha?

02:03:57.957 --> 02:04:00.252
ASHLEY: Can I like slap myself?

02:04:00.252 --> 02:04:01.897
MATT: Unfortunately--

02:04:01.897 --> 02:04:05.484
ASHLEY: Does that not work? Shit. Wasted a rage.

02:04:05.558 --> 02:04:07.425
MATT: It's now Kiri's turn. Kiri holding a
dagger--

02:04:07.425 --> 02:04:09.200
MARISHA: Kiri be my savior!

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.924
SAM: Aw Kiri.

02:04:11.924 --> 02:04:14.411
MATT: She just holds the dagger. That's Kiri's
turn.

02:04:14.411 --> 02:04:15.740
MARISHA: Yeah, Kiri.

02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:22.348
MATT: And shouts, (like Jester) "Fuck!" Jester,
it's your turn.

02:04:22.348 --> 02:04:24.034
LAURA: Can I get within 60 feet of it?

02:04:24.034 --> 02:04:28.829
MATT: Yeah, you're within 60 feet.

02:04:28.829 --> 02:04:31.973
LAURA: Awesome! I'm going to cast Healing Word on
Beau.

02:04:31.973 --> 02:04:33.461
MATT: Oh shit. Okay.

02:04:33.461 --> 02:04:41.022
LAURA: As my bonus action. Healing Word, so you
regain 1d4 plus four hit points.

02:04:41.022 --> 02:04:42.098
LIAM: Wow.

02:04:42.098 --> 02:04:43.303
LAURA: Seven points!

02:04:43.303 --> 02:04:45.242
MATT: So you are conscious.

02:04:45.242 --> 02:04:46.376
MARISHA: Oh! I'm conscious!

02:04:46.376 --> 02:04:50.427
MARK: Being grappled by a troll, one thing at a
time.

02:04:50.427 --> 02:04:51.769
MARISHA: Seven hit points, right?

02:04:51.769 --> 02:04:53.796
TRAVIS: Yeah. Modern Literature!

02:04:53.796 --> 02:04:56.936
LIAM: Lie down, play dead.

02:04:56.936 --> 02:04:58.723
TRAVIS: We don't know what that is.

02:04:58.723 --> 02:05:07.034
MARISHA: I'm going to wake up, see my situation
and go (gasps) and play dead.

02:05:07.034 --> 02:05:09.909
MATT: Okay, so when we come to your turn, you
can do that. You come to consciousness, and you're

02:05:10.057 --> 02:05:13.620
like (panting) and your body hurts, there's all
this stinging from the toxin burning your skin and

02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:19.005
flesh. You're chucked under and you can feel the
claws digging into part of your thigh and side as

02:05:19.005 --> 02:05:23.932
you're being run along by this giant troll
creature. It smells awful; this heavy scent

02:05:23.932 --> 02:05:31.336
of rotting citrus and fungus that's permeating
from its body. That finishes your turn, Jester?

02:05:31.336 --> 02:05:32.662
LAURA: That was my bonus.

02:05:32.662 --> 02:05:34.200
MATT: That was your bonus, you still have your
action.

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:41.288
LAURA: But I don't think I can do anything. I
guess I'll hold an attack, I'll hold--

02:05:41.288 --> 02:05:44.245
MATT: Sacred Flame?

02:05:44.245 --> 02:05:51.550
LAURA: Yeah, I'll hold Sacred Flame until Beau is
dropped and far enough away.

02:05:51.550 --> 02:05:53.790
MATT: You got it. Holding there, Cali, you're up.

02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:57.462
MARK: How close can I get to it with the difficult
terrain? Can I get next to Yasha?

02:05:57.462 --> 02:06:00.664
MATT: You can get that close right now with the
speed of 30 feet, yeah.

02:06:00.664 --> 02:06:10.674
MARK: No, it's fine. I will get there and she
twitches a little bit. Come on! Quickened Levitate

02:06:10.674 --> 02:06:14.567
on Beau. I'm going to try and lift Beau up. If
there's a tree line above, I'm going to try and

02:06:14.567 --> 02:06:16.100
fling her up to the tree line.

02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:21.174
MATT: Interesting! For the purposes of this, make
an arcana check and this is going to be your

02:06:21.174 --> 02:06:22.993
attempt to break the grapple of the troll.

02:06:22.993 --> 02:06:25.287
MARISHA: Come on, Cali!

02:06:25.287 --> 02:06:28.124
MATT: Ten. Not very good at arcana.

02:06:28.124 --> 02:06:29.292
LAURA: Maybe?

02:06:29.292 --> 02:06:31.372
TRAVIS: What?!

02:06:31.372 --> 02:06:37.161
MATT: Two! Fucking! You're a lucky son of a bitch!
It has a plus four on its strength roll.

02:06:37.161 --> 02:06:40.577
MARK: So (whoop).

02:06:40.577 --> 02:06:41.895
MARISHA: Calianna!

02:06:41.895 --> 02:06:47.795
MATT: Ripping from the grip of the troll, Beau
gets lifted into the air, and is now hovering there.

02:06:47.795 --> 02:06:49.264
LAURA: Is she far enough away?

02:06:49.264 --> 02:06:51.828
MARK: Is there a tree line that I can send her to
so she can grab on?

02:06:51.828 --> 02:06:53.628
MATT: Yeah. You can do that.

02:06:53.628 --> 02:06:55.044
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:06:55.044 --> 02:06:56.818
MARK: Grab on!

02:06:56.818 --> 02:06:59.794
TALIESIN: It's like in Willow with the stick.
Woo!

02:06:59.794 --> 02:07:03.341
LAURA: When she is far enough away, I cast Sacred
Flame.

02:07:03.341 --> 02:07:06.829
MARK: For my action, I'm going to do another Acid
Splash because that was a bonus because of

02:07:06.829 --> 02:07:08.081
quickened.

02:07:08.081 --> 02:07:11.807
MATT: Beau is now lifted up into the tree. You're
just within reach of branches when it comes to

02:07:11.807 --> 02:07:12.950
your turn.

02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:14.805
SAM: Okay, everything's fine now.

02:07:14.805 --> 02:07:16.247
LIAM: I mean she's half melted, but...

02:07:16.247 --> 02:07:21.847
MATT: I'm going to be honest, you almost killed
her, man. Scorching Ray if those all had hit,

02:07:21.847 --> 02:07:24.664
Beau's dead. I was like, oh fuck.

02:07:24.664 --> 02:07:28.336
LIAM: We got to cut that dead weight, man.

02:07:28.336 --> 02:07:37.002
MATT: I got real nervous. Magic Missile would have
done the same, too, because it's a splash per

02:07:37.002 --> 02:07:37.976
missile.

02:07:37.976 --> 02:07:39.727
MARISHA: I have blackmail material on you,
motherfucker.

02:07:39.727 --> 02:07:50.959
MATT: Go for it. Dex save for you. Natural 20, and
then for you dex save as well. That is an eight.

02:07:50.959 --> 02:07:55.469
LAURA: Okay, so you get hit with 2d8.

02:07:55.469 --> 02:07:57.128
MATT: Yes.

02:07:57.128 --> 02:07:58.966
LAURA: Nine points!

02:07:58.966 --> 02:08:04.413
MATT: Splashes out. No one is close enough to be
impacted by the effect.

02:08:04.413 --> 02:08:05.700
TRAVIS: How's Febron?

02:08:05.777 --> 02:08:07.141
MATT: Febron's dead. Febron's like--

02:08:07.141 --> 02:08:08.763
TRAVIS: A soggy KFC drumstick.

02:08:08.763 --> 02:08:16.697
MATT: Kind of! His arms and legs are dangling
behind as it's dragging him through. It's pretty rough.

02:08:16.697 --> 02:08:18.790
TALIESIN: Does the radiant damage seem to have a
particular effect?

02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:20.116
MATT: Not beyond anything else.

02:08:20.116 --> 02:08:21.194
TALIESIN: All right.

02:08:21.194 --> 02:08:23.028
LAURA: We should just let him go, huh?

02:08:23.028 --> 02:08:24.656
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:08:24.656 --> 02:08:25.863
MARK: Get out of here!

02:08:25.863 --> 02:08:27.444
MATT: Ending Cali's turn; Nott, you're up.

02:08:27.444 --> 02:08:33.384
SAM: I'm up? Okay, is there anything in melee
range with it? No.

02:08:33.384 --> 02:08:34.872
MATT: Currently no.

02:08:34.872 --> 02:08:38.470
SAM: I'll move within 30 feet.

02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:44.154
MATT: That's as close as you can get right there.
That's not quite within 30 feet.

02:08:44.154 --> 02:08:46.033
SAM: That's as close as I can get?

02:08:46.033 --> 02:08:50.269
LIAM: Nott is double speed and has a ring on for
water walking.

02:08:50.269 --> 02:08:53.480
MATT: For water walking, right. I'll say, for that
purpose, it does give you the extra movement

02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:57.223
there. So now you're just within 30 feet.

02:08:57.223 --> 02:09:02.282
SAM: I don't know that we're letting it go, so I'm
going to cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter on it.

02:09:02.282 --> 02:09:14.703
Throw out a little piece of pastry and I'll yell
to it: What's a swamp frog's favorite drug?

02:09:14.703 --> 02:09:16.707
Croak-aine!

02:09:16.707 --> 02:09:19.170
(groaning)

02:09:19.170 --> 02:09:21.008
SAM: They're not winners, guys.

02:09:21.008 --> 02:09:25.689
MATT: Wisdom save is a 13. What's your DC?

02:09:25.689 --> 02:09:26.856
SAM: It's a 14.

02:09:26.856 --> 02:09:34.642
MATT: 14, it fails! It immediately falls prone,
laughing with the corpse of Febron being flailed

02:09:34.642 --> 02:09:39.517
about in the air as it's spinning. The legs and
arms--

02:09:39.517 --> 02:09:44.420
SAM: I'll use my extra action to attack.

02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:50.140
MATT: Well technically, you can only do the bonus
action to attack if you use the attack action.

02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:52.864
SAM: This is an extra attack action.

02:09:52.864 --> 02:09:54.780
MATT: Oh! Because you're hasted! That's right!
Sorry, I was thinking of the bonus action, you're

02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:55.615
correct.

02:09:55.615 --> 02:09:57.196
SAM: I rolled a 16 plus seven, 23.

02:09:57.196 --> 02:09:58.638
MATT: That hits.

02:09:58.638 --> 02:10:01.539
SAM: Because it's prone do I get advantage or
anything?

02:10:01.539 --> 02:10:02.787
LAURA: No, you get disadvantage.

02:10:02.787 --> 02:10:12.864
SAM: Oh, natural 20, so it still hits, 23. But do
I get sneak attack? No. Because it's prone, no.

02:10:12.901 --> 02:10:15.641
MATT: No, because you do not have advantage on the
attack, unfortunately.

02:10:15.641 --> 02:10:18.533
SAM: Oh, look. it's a ten to hit.

02:10:18.533 --> 02:10:19.628
MATT: Nice.

02:10:19.628 --> 02:10:20.884
SAM: I mean ten points of damage.

02:10:20.884 --> 02:10:22.959
MATT: It sinks into it.

02:10:22.959 --> 02:10:25.305
SAM: I don't get a bonus action off of that
attack?

02:10:25.305 --> 02:10:26.510
MATT: You do because it's an attack action.

02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:32.615
SAM: Okay, I'll fire again. Natural 20 and a 20,
just a straight 20.

02:10:32.615 --> 02:10:36.769
MATT: Okay, that hits. To two? Oh man, that
sucks.

02:10:36.769 --> 02:10:39.088
SAM: Another seven points of damage.

02:10:39.088 --> 02:10:42.918
MATT: Seven points of damage. That finishes your
turn, Nott, well done. On the ground you're firing

02:10:42.918 --> 02:10:47.946
both of those. They're sticking inside, these
sprays of poison toxin out of his body as it's

02:10:47.946 --> 02:10:52.025
laughing on the ground. For Tasha's Hideous
laughter, does it get a chance to break?

02:10:52.025 --> 02:11:01.974
SAM: Let me see, at the end of each of its turns
or each time it takes damage, a target can make a

02:11:01.974 --> 02:11:03.380
wisdom saving throw.

02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:05.793
MATT: Nope, that was a two.

02:11:05.793 --> 02:11:10.263
SAM: Target has advantage on that save if it's
triggered by that damage.

02:11:10.263 --> 02:11:14.381
MATT: The second roll was a 16, so it succeeds. It
fell prone, gave you disadvantage on the attacks,

02:11:14.442 --> 02:11:16.648
and then got out of your spell. Lesson learned.

02:11:16.648 --> 02:11:18.738
SAM: Nice. Right, good to know.

02:11:18.738 --> 02:11:24.188
MATT: But it is prone. That finishes your turn,
Nott. Molly.

02:11:24.188 --> 02:11:31.499
TALIESIN: Where is the little bird?

02:11:31.499 --> 02:11:33.549
MATT: Right here.

02:11:33.549 --> 02:11:38.906
TALIESIN: There's really not much I can do here,
so I'm going to--

02:11:38.906 --> 02:11:40.482
TRAVIS: Send it packing, Molly.

02:11:40.482 --> 02:11:42.639
TALIESIN: I got nothing I can do.

02:11:42.639 --> 02:11:44.756
LAURA: Then get the fuck out of here.

02:11:44.756 --> 02:11:48.324
SAM: (Infernal voice) Get the fuck out of here.

02:11:48.324 --> 02:12:00.373
TALIESIN: Well, I can do that, I'm going to do one
more attempt to do a Devil's Tongue.

02:12:00.373 --> 02:12:02.078
TRAVIS: What does it sound like?

02:12:02.078 --> 02:12:04.474
TALIESIN: (demonic) Scoot, scoot! Scoot!

02:12:04.474 --> 02:12:10.446
MATT: It rolled a three minus one, so it succeeds.
It takes what type of psychic damage?

02:12:10.446 --> 02:12:20.540
TALIESIN: Oh, wow, holy cow. I'm not used to it
working. 5th-level, so hey, look at that, it

02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:28.656
actually has gone up. 2d4 psychic damage. That's
four points of damage and it has disadvantage on

02:12:28.656 --> 02:12:30.401
its next attack roll.

02:12:30.401 --> 02:12:36.230
MATT: Interesting, okay, so psychic damage strikes
it and it does not spray the venomous toxin upon

02:12:36.230 --> 02:12:43.270
receiving the psychic damage. But it is grabbing
its head, now the laughter has subsided.

02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:45.461
TALIESIN: Brain freeze.

02:12:45.461 --> 02:12:48.379
MATT: It's trying to get back to its feet. That
finishes your turn, Molly?

02:12:48.379 --> 02:12:49.449
TALIESIN: That's all I got.

02:12:49.449 --> 02:12:52.320
MATT: Beau, you're up in the trees. Fjord, you're
on the ground.

02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:53.715
MARISHA: Okay.

02:12:53.715 --> 02:12:56.036
MATT: You're levitating.

02:12:56.036 --> 02:12:57.853
MARISHA: I am levitating.

02:12:57.853 --> 02:12:59.628
LAURA: Can you try and hold on to the branch?

02:12:59.628 --> 02:13:04.012
MARISHA: Yeah, can I scootch and perch up on the
branch?

02:13:04.012 --> 02:13:09.238
MATT: Sure, you still have the levitation spell on
you, so if you were to leap, you'd just glide.

02:13:09.238 --> 02:13:10.488
LIAM: Marry Poppins!

02:13:10.488 --> 02:13:15.146
MARISHA: I grip the tree branch with my thighs,
I'm going to force grip it.

02:13:15.146 --> 02:13:16.819
MATT: Okay, so you're on the branch there.

02:13:16.819 --> 02:13:20.047
MARISHA: Yeah, side saddle and then I'm going to--
I don't know why I'm acting like I'm drawing a bow

02:13:20.047 --> 02:13:25.591
like I'm a bow user because I've never been a bow
user, but my name is Beau. I'm going to take two

02:13:25.591 --> 02:13:30.179
shurikens and do that.

02:13:30.179 --> 02:13:31.739
TRAVIS: Hadouken!

02:13:31.739 --> 02:13:40.471
MARISHA: First attack, don't fuck me Gil, 15.

02:13:40.471 --> 02:13:42.507
MATT: 15 just hits.

02:13:42.507 --> 02:13:43.597
MARISHA: Okay.

02:13:43.597 --> 02:13:47.233
MATT: When it is prone you have disadvantage, so
roll again to attack. It's a ranged attack.

02:13:47.233 --> 02:13:50.245
MARISHA: Oh wow, that's 14.

02:13:50.245 --> 02:13:53.424
MATT: 14 just misses. It sinks into the swamp mud
next to it.

02:13:53.424 --> 02:13:56.291
MARISHA: Bummer, second one, natural 20.

02:13:56.291 --> 02:13:58.754
MATT: One more time because this has disadvantage.

02:13:58.754 --> 02:14:00.325
MARISHA: 14.

02:14:00.325 --> 02:14:02.314
MATT: Okay, so that does hit, roll damage on the
second one.

02:14:02.314 --> 02:14:04.942
MARISHA: Which is a d4 we've said, correct?

02:14:04.942 --> 02:14:06.056
MATT: That is correct.

02:14:06.056 --> 02:14:10.982
LIAM: Oh, cocked. Super cocked. More!

02:14:10.982 --> 02:14:13.195
MARISHA: Sure, I'll take that. That's a ten.

02:14:13.195 --> 02:14:14.548
MATT: Ten?

02:14:14.548 --> 02:14:15.650
MARISHA: Yeah, damage.

02:14:15.650 --> 02:14:16.667
MATT: Four plus--

02:14:16.667 --> 02:14:20.194
MARISHA: Four plus six, my attack bonus, right?

02:14:20.194 --> 02:14:21.418
MATT: Damage bonus.

02:14:21.418 --> 02:14:24.016
MARISHA: My damage bonus. Oh I'm sorry, eight.

02:14:24.016 --> 02:14:29.814
MATT: Eight, that's what I thought. Eight points
of damage. The shuriken sinks into its chest;

02:14:29.814 --> 02:14:34.206
another spray of toxin. Nothing in the vicinity to
take the damage, that finish your turn?

02:14:34.206 --> 02:14:35.447
MARISHA: I have a bonus, right?

02:14:35.447 --> 02:14:36.309
MATT: You do.

02:14:36.309 --> 02:14:37.347
MARISHA: But I can't do a range.

02:14:37.347 --> 02:14:41.500
MATT: No, it's only unarmed. I think that's your
turn.

02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:42.976
TALIESIN: Glug glug.

02:14:42.976 --> 02:14:44.379
TRAVIS: Glug glug?

02:14:44.379 --> 02:14:45.750
MARISHA: I don't have a healing potion.

02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:47.003
TRAVIS: She doesn't have a glug glug.

02:14:47.003 --> 02:14:48.153
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

02:14:48.153 --> 02:14:53.094
TRAVIS: I'll move five feet closer towards el
troll, and I'll say: Get the fuck out of here! And

02:14:53.094 --> 02:14:54.335
I'll Eldritch Blast twice.

02:14:54.335 --> 02:14:55.929
MATT: Go for it. Disadvantage on each strike.

02:14:55.929 --> 02:15:01.013
TRAVIS: That's going to miss anyway, and the
second one. They both miss.

02:15:01.013 --> 02:15:05.654
MATT: They both go passing right over its body as
it's trying to get up. It slips for a second, and

02:15:05.654 --> 02:15:09.028
what would've hit, it ducks out of the way just in
time and both of them arc off, hitting nothing.

02:15:09.028 --> 02:15:10.594
TRAVIS: You get your ass out of this forest!

02:15:10.594 --> 02:15:15.562
MATT: That finishes your turn. It's now the
troll's turn. It gets up, half its movement, and

02:15:15.638 --> 02:15:20.434
it's going to run 15 feet this way and then a full
action run for another 30 feet, and it's darting

02:15:20.434 --> 02:15:25.067
off with the corpse of Febron under its arm. It
has its prize and it's running off into the swamp.

02:15:25.067 --> 02:15:28.550
It's hurting, but you're watching its flesh stitch
together a little more and starting to heal up

02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:29.811
from some of the wounds.

02:15:29.811 --> 02:15:32.492
TRAVIS: Yeah, get the fuck on out! Nobody wants
you here, anyway!

02:15:32.492 --> 02:15:33.877
MATT: Is anybody pursuing?

02:15:33.877 --> 02:15:39.080
LIAM: Yes, it's in my range. I will walk 15 feet forward
and cast Fire Bolt from here. It's a 120-foot range.

02:15:39.158 --> 02:15:40.913
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for that.

02:15:40.913 --> 02:15:45.772
LIAM: Oh that's not the d20, hold on. That's a
natural one.

02:15:45.772 --> 02:15:50.392
MATT: Nope. The Fire Bolt vanishes beyond its
space there. Anybody else with a ranged attack

02:15:50.392 --> 02:15:51.670
that wants to try and make it?

02:15:51.670 --> 02:15:52.718
SAM: Sure, I'll take a shot.

02:15:52.718 --> 02:15:53.649
MATT: Go for it.

02:15:53.649 --> 02:15:54.978
SAM: At disadvantage?

02:15:54.978 --> 02:15:57.453
MATT: At this range it is.

02:15:57.453 --> 02:15:59.702
SAM: 12.

02:15:59.702 --> 02:16:07.250
MATT: 12 misses. It's starting to hit the mist and
its form is starting to become a little harder to see

02:16:07.250 --> 02:16:08.900
and it's running with such an intense speed.

02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:11.466
SAM: I've got one more hasted action.

02:16:11.466 --> 02:16:13.501
MATT: You do. And a bonus action attack if you
want to.

02:16:13.501 --> 02:16:17.313
SAM: Terrible. 14?

02:16:17.313 --> 02:16:19.439
MATT: 14? No, just misses.

02:16:19.439 --> 02:16:24.426
SAM: Okay, and a bonus attack action. 16.

02:16:24.426 --> 02:16:26.100
MATT: Roll damage. It does strike.

02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:27.471
SAM: Hey, that's one!

02:16:27.471 --> 02:16:28.856
MARISHA: Kill it!

02:16:28.856 --> 02:16:30.682
SAM: Eight points of damage.

02:16:30.682 --> 02:16:39.601
MATT: Eight points of damage. It manages to catch
it. It's still running. Fjord, you're the only one

02:16:39.601 --> 02:16:42.069
with a proper ranged attack here if you want to
try.

02:16:42.069 --> 02:16:46.425
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll do it. I'll take two more
Eldritch Blasts at it. At disadvantage, right?

02:16:46.425 --> 02:16:53.553
That's a natural one. My bad. 19. 18! That'll hit,
that's 25.

02:16:53.553 --> 02:16:55.396
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

02:16:55.396 --> 02:16:58.418
TRAVIS: 1d10. That's nine plus four. 13 points of
Eldritch Blast.

02:16:58.418 --> 02:16:59.594
MARISHA: He's got our gold!

02:16:59.594 --> 02:17:02.614
MATT: It gets blasted. Still going.

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:04.231
TRAVIS: You fucking piece of shit!

02:17:04.231 --> 02:17:07.108
MARISHA: How far away is he right now?

02:17:07.108 --> 02:17:10.920
MATT: Well, now it takes its next turn to do a
full 60-foot run.

02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:13.662
MARISHA: I couldn't jump one more and try to get
him a little--

02:17:13.662 --> 02:17:15.732
LAURA: I don't think he's going down with it.

02:17:15.732 --> 02:17:21.855
MATT: At this point, the fact that you guys are
having a hard time hitting it and the rate that

02:17:21.916 --> 02:17:23.825
it's healing, you're starting to think--

02:17:23.825 --> 02:17:25.165
MARISHA: Oh, he's healing?

02:17:25.165 --> 02:17:26.167
MATT: Yeah.

02:17:26.167 --> 02:17:28.115
TRAVIS: Don't you dare tell us what we're starting
to think!

02:17:28.115 --> 02:17:31.349
MATT: I'm just saying, you can continue to pursue
if you want to.

02:17:31.349 --> 02:17:32.269
MARISHA: No.

02:17:32.269 --> 02:17:33.535
LAURA: But we'd be idiots.

02:17:33.535 --> 02:17:36.540
MARK: But the implication is: You really don't.

02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:38.560
SAM: We know where he lives!

02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.346
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right. We know where his
hovel is. So lesson learned.

02:17:42.554 --> 02:17:45.083
LAURA: Oh, there's a dead person I'm talking to!

02:17:45.083 --> 02:17:46.436
SAM: We have one more question!

02:17:46.436 --> 02:17:47.718
LAURA: I turn around and run back to the dead
person.

02:17:47.718 --> 02:17:51.883
TRAVIS: Beau is just: You fucking--!

02:17:51.883 --> 02:17:54.378
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm doggy-paddling through the
air.

02:17:54.378 --> 02:17:55.540
SAM: Will you let our friend down?

02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:57.343
MARK: Oh yeah, sorry Ms. Beau!

02:17:57.343 --> 02:18:01.953
MARISHA: I slow fall.

02:18:01.953 --> 02:18:03.735
TRAVIS: Still one more question.

02:18:03.735 --> 02:18:05.629
LIAM: Matt, we're still in the middle of nowhere
at this point, or we're--?

02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:11.229
MATT: You guys are right at the edge of where
these bodies have been propped up as a warning,

02:18:11.229 --> 02:18:17.539
which, from what Febron told you, was placed up
to prevent people from coming towards the safe house.

02:18:17.539 --> 02:18:24.094
LIAM: We don't have our guide anymore. Ask this
one which way to go.

02:18:24.094 --> 02:18:27.469
LAURA: Oh, this isn't the safe house?

02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:29.502
SAM: This is the gate of the safe house.

02:18:29.502 --> 02:18:32.503
MATT: You're starting to get close to it, as far
as you know.

02:18:32.503 --> 02:18:33.967
LIAM: As far as we know.

02:18:33.967 --> 02:18:35.385
MARISHA: If these are the warnings.

02:18:35.385 --> 02:18:38.209
SAM: Specific directions.

02:18:38.209 --> 02:18:44.304
LAURA: All right. I guess that's what I'll ask it,
then, because that's all I can ask.

02:18:44.304 --> 02:18:48.277
MATT: As you approach the head is tracking you the
whole time.

02:18:48.277 --> 02:18:51.842
LAURA: Sorry, we got distracted, there was a troll
that came and stole our guide. I think you might

02:18:51.842 --> 02:19:01.518
have known him. Anyway, which way is the actual
safe house that we're trying to get to?

02:19:01.518 --> 02:19:09.919
MATT: The head curves off to the right between the
tree that it's stapled to and the other body

02:19:09.919 --> 02:19:14.512
that's propped up. "100 feet that way."

02:19:14.512 --> 02:19:17.759
LAURA: Oh shit. We totally could have seen it!

02:19:17.759 --> 02:19:19.594
SAM: I can see it, it's right there!

02:19:19.594 --> 02:19:25.512
MATT: You don't see any safe house. You don't see
anything like that. At that point the head (sighs)

02:19:25.512 --> 02:19:29.335
continues back.

02:19:29.335 --> 02:19:32.177
LAURA: Well, at least we know it's 100 feet, so we
can search for it.

02:19:32.177 --> 02:19:34.220
TALIESIN: Are there actual knives stuck in--

02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:37.413
MATT: Looks to be two shortswords have been jammed
into it.

02:19:37.413 --> 02:19:39.123
TALIESIN: Shortswords or daggers?

02:19:39.123 --> 02:19:40.366
MATT: Shortswords.

02:19:40.366 --> 02:19:42.558
LAURA: Do they have anything in their pockets?

02:19:42.558 --> 02:19:44.033
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:19:44.033 --> 02:19:49.285
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're looting these bodies right
now. That's nice.

02:19:49.285 --> 02:19:52.610
LAURA: Investigation, you say? 14?

02:19:52.610 --> 02:20:00.202
MATT: Okay. Rummaging through the pockets and the
various baubles you can find, you find four pieces

02:20:00.202 --> 02:20:07.703
of gold, a handful of about 12 silver-- this is on
the halfling-- a charm, looks like it's made from

02:20:07.703 --> 02:20:12.036
a dried animal foot of some kind, like a dog or a
coyote.

02:20:12.036 --> 02:20:13.557
TALIESIN: (hiccups)

02:20:13.557 --> 02:20:14.906
MATT: (imitates a hiccup)

02:20:14.906 --> 02:20:16.280
LIAM: It's cursed hiccups.

02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:26.057
MATT: And a note that's keeping track of
locations, but it's mostly soaked now and the ink

02:20:26.148 --> 02:20:30.455
has all run, and you make out bits of words here
and there, but it makes no sense to you.

02:20:30.455 --> 02:20:32.292
LAURA: I'm taking it.

02:20:32.292 --> 02:20:34.003
SAM: Give me the charm.

02:20:34.003 --> 02:20:35.960
LAURA: Are you going to check if it's magic?

02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:37.133
SAM: Yes.

02:20:37.133 --> 02:20:38.213
LAURA: Okay.

02:20:38.213 --> 02:20:39.960
SAM: I don't check if it's magic.

02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:45.660
LAURA: I'm going to use Mending on the note. Oh
wait, it doesn't make the words come back.

02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:47.391
Remember, we already figured this part out.

02:20:47.391 --> 02:20:52.056
MATT: Yeah, the paper is now dry and a full piece
of paper, but the ink is still as smeared and lost

02:20:52.056 --> 02:20:53.385
as it was before.

02:20:53.385 --> 02:20:54.941
SAM: Can I look at the words?

02:20:54.941 --> 02:21:03.003
MATT: The few words you make out involve a time.
One of them says two hours past the noon sun,

02:21:03.003 --> 02:21:08.553
that's the most you make out of one sentence. Part
of it's smeared. It's like Steve Martin in The

02:21:08.553 --> 02:21:16.432
Jerk trying to read the love letter. (gibberish)
The other things you can make out are four men

02:21:16.432 --> 02:21:25.311
required, and then another one saying something
about Shady-- and that's all you make out.

02:21:25.311 --> 02:21:28.317
LAURA: Shady grove. I bet the Shady grove.

02:21:28.317 --> 02:21:30.133
SAM: Shadycreek.

02:21:30.133 --> 02:21:35.696
LIAM: I'll say while Jester was doing all that,
Caleb sat down and took out his spellbook and

02:21:35.696 --> 02:21:37.738
started ritual casting Detect Magic.

02:21:37.738 --> 02:21:41.419
TRAVIS: Yeah, in fact, could we could take a short
rest while Caleb's doing that since that was a

02:21:41.419 --> 02:21:43.404
little gnarlier than we anticipated?

02:21:43.404 --> 02:21:46.714
LIAM: Well, maybe after I do that because I'm
tapped.

02:21:46.714 --> 02:21:47.725
MARISHA: My body hurts.

02:21:47.725 --> 02:21:48.992
LAURA: I'm going to heal you.

02:21:48.992 --> 02:21:53.228
MATT: Okay, we'll take a short rest here and while
we're doing that we'll also take a break. Restroom

02:21:53.228 --> 02:21:56.917
here. We'll be back here in just a few minutes.
Thank you for kicking with us. We have our

02:21:56.917 --> 02:22:03.869
Wyrmwood giveaway today. We have a fantastic
lacewood deck box. Lacewood, it's got a really

02:22:03.869 --> 02:22:12.244
cool texture. It looks like a chainmail. It's one
of the cooler-looking woods, in my opinion. This

02:22:12.318 --> 02:22:16.359
is going to be a giveaway for one of you lucky
winners in the chat in the US or Canada, excluding

02:22:16.359 --> 02:22:22.027
Quebec. Head on over to the Twitch chat to enter
the phrase tonight. Enter only once or you will be

02:22:22.027 --> 02:22:27.323
disqualified. However, for tonight, the word is
"bird." Bird is the word.

02:22:27.323 --> 02:22:31.178
MATT, TRAVIS, MARISHA, MARK, TALIESIN, ASHLEY:
(singing) Bird, bird, bird. Bird is the word.

02:22:31.178 --> 02:22:32.588
B-b-b-bird, bird, bird.

02:22:32.588 --> 02:22:35.667
MATT: We'll be back in a few minutes, guys. We'll
see you then. Enjoy the break time, enjoy the

02:22:35.667 --> 02:22:40.247
rewatch of our awesome D&amp;amp;D Beyond video. Back here
in a minute.

02:22:41.407 --> 02:22:45.983
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back! I just
dropped my note. I'll pick it up in a second. So

02:22:46.001 --> 02:22:53.311
before we get into it, we're going to announce the
winner of our giveaway! The winner of our

02:22:53.311 --> 02:23:01.235
fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway is the_bowmeister.
(surfer voice) The_bowmeister, enjoy your

02:23:01.235 --> 02:23:05.491
Wyrmwood! (normal voice) So congratulations, we'll
get that sent out to you ASAP.

02:23:05.491 --> 02:23:07.368
LIAM: That's very Wildemount, the_bowmeister.

02:23:07.368 --> 02:23:12.744
MATT: The_bowmeister? Ja, possibly would be.
Back into the game we go.

02:23:12.744 --> 02:23:14.583
MARISHA: Oh, now you got it on Mark!

02:23:14.583 --> 02:23:16.610
MATT: Ugh! (blood spraying)

02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:18.407
TALIESIN: Roll a d4.

02:23:18.407 --> 02:23:22.559
SAM: Just real quick, I wanted to give a quick
shoutout to my brother-in-law, Peter Habib of Mr.

02:23:22.559 --> 02:23:27.430
Fantastic Music. They did the track for the
animated thing.

02:23:27.430 --> 02:23:28.619
TRAVIS: So good!

02:23:28.619 --> 02:23:31.747
ASHLEY: So good! I love it.

02:23:31.747 --> 02:23:33.441
SAM: (Scottish accent) I love it!

02:23:33.441 --> 02:23:39.044
MATT: Indeed. Bringing us back into the game. You
guys have taken your short rest, healed up a bit,

02:23:39.044 --> 02:23:44.920
and recovered from the chaos of the swamp you
managed to trudge through. You've lost your guide,

02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:56.360
but you've survived thus far. The rest of you, at
least. What would you like to do? Oh, you were casting--

02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:57.742
LIAM: Scorching Ray on Beau.

02:23:57.742 --> 02:23:59.299
MATT: Yes.

02:23:59.299 --> 02:24:00.921
MARK: Finish her off.

02:24:00.921 --> 02:24:04.793
TRAVIS: Finish her.

02:24:04.793 --> 02:24:07.611
MARISHA: I trusted you, motherfucker.

02:24:07.611 --> 02:24:09.920
LIAM: I told you everything. You have to die!

02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:12.161
MATT: Utilizing Detect Magic, you were saying--

02:24:12.161 --> 02:24:13.243
LIAM: Yeah.

02:24:13.243 --> 02:24:14.514
MATT: On?

02:24:14.514 --> 02:24:20.312
LIAM: Well, it's like blacklight, so on everything
on what they were looking at.

02:24:20.312 --> 02:24:23.426
MATT: Nothing magical within what was found on the
bodies, no.

02:24:23.426 --> 02:24:26.282
LIAM: Is Nott glowing in any kind of way that I am
not used to?

02:24:26.282 --> 02:24:27.240
MATT: Correct.

02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:29.009
TRAVIS: How far does that extend?

02:24:29.009 --> 02:24:32.664
LIAM: 30 feet, I believe.

02:24:32.664 --> 02:24:37.383
TRAVIS: It occurred to me from what your friend
said that this location might not be entirely

02:24:37.383 --> 02:24:40.253
above ground any longer.

02:24:40.253 --> 02:24:46.859
LAURA: Mm-hmm. My dead friend? Yeah, I think it
might be hidden or something.

02:24:46.859 --> 02:24:50.580
TRAVIS: Yeah. Two hours past, what was it, noon?

02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:51.911
MARISHA: Two past noon.

02:24:51.911 --> 02:24:54.308
TRAVIS: Maybe it only becomes visible at a certain
time?

02:24:54.308 --> 02:24:55.929
MARISHA: Four men required.

02:24:55.929 --> 02:25:01.152
LIAM: You, my good friend, would you walk with me
in the direction that the dead person said that

02:25:01.152 --> 02:25:04.793
this entrance is in? Before my magic runs out.

02:25:04.793 --> 02:25:08.527
MARISHA: Why do you feel the need to call me a
good friend?

02:25:08.527 --> 02:25:13.301
LIAM: You're right. Person that I work with, would
you walk over before my spell runs out so that I

02:25:13.301 --> 02:25:14.908
can use it to help the group?

02:25:14.908 --> 02:25:16.308
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:25:16.308 --> 02:25:21.162
TALIESIN: Why don't we all head in that direction,
maybe? In a large, well knit group.

02:25:21.162 --> 02:25:23.929
TRAVIS: Since there are things that'll be snagging
bitches when we get separated.

02:25:23.929 --> 02:25:25.463
MARK: Is it dark, or is it--?

02:25:25.463 --> 02:25:29.904
MATT: No, at this point it's later afternoon,
maybe. It's like two or three o'clock.

02:25:29.904 --> 02:25:31.974
MARISHA: Maybe like, two past noon?

02:25:31.974 --> 02:25:33.364
MATT: Maybe.

02:25:33.364 --> 02:25:38.546
LIAM: Caleb knows exactly what time it is. Liam
likes to burn his friends.

02:25:38.546 --> 02:25:40.417
SAM: Caleb also likes to burn his friends.

02:25:40.417 --> 02:25:42.099
LAURA: Aw.

02:25:42.099 --> 02:25:45.049
TALIESIN: (singing) One thing, we've got it
coming.

02:25:45.049 --> 02:25:52.154
MATT: You left early enough in the day where you
aren't threatened for dusk for another few hours.

02:25:52.154 --> 02:25:53.801
You guys continue on past the tree?

02:25:53.801 --> 02:25:55.785
LIAM: Towards the 100-foot mark that the--

02:25:55.785 --> 02:25:57.632
SAM: Should we scan for traps?

02:25:57.632 --> 02:25:59.298
LAURA: Probably.

02:25:59.298 --> 02:26:01.258
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:26:01.258 --> 02:26:05.441
MARK: Caleb's Detect Magic would probably pick up
traces on my bracelet.

02:26:05.441 --> 02:26:06.576
MATT: That's true.

02:26:06.576 --> 02:26:07.954
LIAM: So it glows.

02:26:07.954 --> 02:26:11.559
MATT: Outside of the space around you or the
trinkets found within the corpses, nothing. But

02:26:11.559 --> 02:26:15.976
you do see the mild glow from the bracelet on
Cali's arm.

02:26:15.976 --> 02:26:17.970
LAURA: Hey Cali, can I ask you a question?

02:26:17.970 --> 02:26:19.007
SAM: 19.

02:26:19.007 --> 02:26:20.558
MARK: Sure, Jester!

02:26:20.558 --> 02:26:21.878
LAURA: On check traps, sorry.

02:26:21.878 --> 02:26:22.934
SAM: No, go ahead.

02:26:22.934 --> 02:26:24.916
LAURA: This bowl that we're looking for.

02:26:24.916 --> 02:26:25.707
MARK: Yep.

02:26:25.707 --> 02:26:27.684
LAURA: You said it was used in rituals.

02:26:27.684 --> 02:26:32.654
MARK: I think it is, yeah. It's more that I know
that it's part of a set that I know this cult were

02:26:32.654 --> 02:26:34.729
looking for and I want to stop them getting it.

02:26:34.729 --> 02:26:36.443
SAM: Like a tea set?

02:26:36.443 --> 02:26:40.121
LAURA: Were you ever used in rituals with these
bowls?

02:26:40.121 --> 02:26:48.463
MARK: Kind of. Not ones involving this bowl. But
other rituals. God, this sounds really horrible to

02:26:48.463 --> 02:26:55.305
say. They weren't nice people. They kill people
and I kind of helped them because I didn't know

02:26:55.305 --> 02:27:00.675
any better. You got to remember, Serissa, the
priestess who raised me, she told me all this

02:27:00.675 --> 02:27:04.994
stuff about the Tyrant, about the Queen, and I
thought that that was just what the world was

02:27:04.994 --> 02:27:09.157
like, you know, I thought that that was good, and
she told me that these other people were bad, and

02:27:09.157 --> 02:27:13.916
thieves, and that they were being killed for
righteous purpose.

02:27:13.916 --> 02:27:15.200
LAURA: Who were the bad people?

02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:16.292
SAM: What queen?

02:27:16.292 --> 02:27:22.194
MARK: The Scaled Tyrant. They call her the Queen.
She's the Queen of Dragons. Five draconic heads

02:27:22.194 --> 02:27:25.031
represent her, and that kind of thing.

02:27:25.031 --> 02:27:27.061
SAM: So not a real queen?

02:27:27.061 --> 02:27:31.545
MARK: Maybe she's a real queen, I don't know. I
just always heard to her referred to as the

02:27:31.545 --> 02:27:34.313
Queen.

02:27:34.313 --> 02:27:36.662
ASHLEY: She has five heads?

02:27:36.662 --> 02:27:39.798
MARK: That's what the stories say. One for each
color of dragon.

02:27:39.798 --> 02:27:41.420
LIAM: Would I know about this?

02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:42.716
MATT: Make a religion check.

02:27:42.716 --> 02:27:45.375
LAURA: Oh, I know about re-- No. I don't know
anything about religion.

02:27:45.375 --> 02:27:47.353
MATT: You can make a religion check if you want to
try and recall information.

02:27:47.353 --> 02:27:48.571
LIAM: 13.

02:27:48.571 --> 02:27:52.153
MATT: 13. You've heard of the Scaled Tyrant. You
don't know a whole lot of information. But you

02:27:52.153 --> 02:27:59.961
know, through your research, that one of the
entities that partook in elements of the Calamity.

02:27:59.961 --> 02:28:03.982
LIAM: Obviously not part of the okayed deities of
the Empire.

02:28:03.982 --> 02:28:09.028
MATT: No. Not at all. Is definitely considered one
of the betrayer gods in the Calamity, though very

02:28:09.028 --> 02:28:13.690
selfish and is considered by many to be the
patron-- whether it be the mother of, or the

02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:20.363
patron of, chromatic dragons.

02:28:20.363 --> 02:28:26.374
MARK: Serissa, the priestess who found me, she was
nice to me, but she would torture and kill people

02:28:26.374 --> 02:28:27.883
in her name.

02:28:27.883 --> 02:28:29.562
LAURA: What kind of people?

02:28:29.562 --> 02:28:34.817
MARK: Merchants, people who had things the cult
wanted and they wanted to take, and they said it

02:28:34.817 --> 02:28:43.842
was rightfully theirs. But I've learned that it's
not anymore. And yeah, I helped them do that.

02:28:43.842 --> 02:28:47.436
That's why I want to stop these bowls. I want to
stop them doing this to other people.

02:28:47.436 --> 02:28:49.480
LAURA: They are super evil bowls?

02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:55.420
MARK: I don't think so. I think they're like
magically minor, like a little bit magic, but as

02:28:55.420 --> 02:28:57.990
long as they're not used by the wrong people they
should be fine.

02:28:57.990 --> 02:29:00.323
ASHLEY: What do you plan to do with the bowl once
you get it?

02:29:00.323 --> 02:29:05.559
MARK: Destroy it if I can. Take it and hide it
somewhere that they can't find it. They raised me,

02:29:05.559 --> 02:29:10.944
and I learned a lot, and I know what they're
capable of and I feel responsible for the things I

02:29:10.944 --> 02:29:18.241
helped them do. So I feel like it's my
responsibility to stop them.

02:29:18.241 --> 02:29:21.252
ASHLEY: How was the bowl used in the ritual?

02:29:21.252 --> 02:29:26.027
MARK: It's not one I was familiar with, but I just
know that it's part of a set. There's six of them,

02:29:26.027 --> 02:29:28.687
I think. Different things that they all use.

02:29:28.687 --> 02:29:30.913
MARISHA: Are you trying to look for all six of
them?

02:29:30.913 --> 02:29:34.968
MARK: If I can, but they're hard to find. The cult
works in shadows, they keep themselves really

02:29:34.968 --> 02:29:39.534
secretive. I wasn't allowed outside of our temple
where I was raised. They gave me everything I

02:29:39.534 --> 02:29:46.345
wanted, but I wasn't allowed outside, so I guess I
can be a bit naive about a few things.

02:29:46.345 --> 02:29:51.501
LAURA: I don't think being stuck inside makes you
naive. I mean, I know some people that were stuck

02:29:51.501 --> 02:29:53.539
inside that know lots of things.

02:29:53.599 --> 02:29:58.112
MARK: Really? I hope that I can meet them. I feel
like I need to learn a lot more, you know? So many

02:29:58.112 --> 02:30:03.423
people treat me-- I ask if I can trust them, they
say yes, and then they trick me. Or they use me to

02:30:03.423 --> 02:30:04.577
do bad things.

02:30:04.577 --> 02:30:05.704
LAURA: That's not okay.

02:30:05.704 --> 02:30:07.602
MARK: I know, right!

02:30:07.602 --> 02:30:13.028
LIAM: She's talking about herself.

02:30:13.028 --> 02:30:17.210
TRAVIS: Cali, do you plan to go back to Port
Damali after this if you're successful?

02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:23.102
MARK: Maybe, yeah. I'll try and get away, I guess.
I've got a friend there, a legionnaire. He rescued

02:30:23.102 --> 02:30:31.977
me. He's a dwarf called Grim. I'm sure he'd help
me find a secure place for the artifact. I don't

02:30:32.051 --> 02:30:42.112
know. Yeah. I guess I'll try and find somewhere to
hide them and keep on trying to stop these guys.

02:30:42.112 --> 02:30:45.681
TRAVIS: Absolutely. Well, let's try our luck.

02:30:45.681 --> 02:30:48.023
LIAM: It seems like a very large task for one
person.

02:30:48.023 --> 02:30:51.915
MATT: At this point, Nott has completed quite a
thorough sweep of the vicinity as you move

02:30:51.915 --> 02:31:02.589
forward. No traps. You do notice, as you head into
this next open clearing, there's thick patches of

02:31:02.589 --> 02:31:13.997
vines and roots that descend into a circular space
that is awash with swamp water and general bog rot

02:31:13.997 --> 02:31:20.963
that is floating over the surface, like a moat has
formed naturally around this giant banyan tree

02:31:20.963 --> 02:31:26.730
about 30 or 40 feet across from side to side. It
is gargantuan. The roots rise up, and merge at

02:31:26.730 --> 02:31:32.263
different places where the tree itself begins to
expand about ten feet up before it reaches out and

02:31:32.263 --> 02:31:38.578
curves and carves into the earth before
disappearing beneath the water, the still, awful

02:31:38.578 --> 02:31:47.383
swamp water that surrounds it. You also see,
across the front of its trunk in the vicinity, at

02:31:47.383 --> 02:31:51.777
least the bits where the sunlight comes through
from the rather choked boughs above that are

02:31:51.777 --> 02:31:59.553
shading the area quite heavily, six more bodies
tied to branches and roots with rope and vine.

02:31:59.553 --> 02:32:04.175
Their bodies covered with similar wounds as the
ones you inspected before. Some are slumped

02:32:04.175 --> 02:32:10.437
against the base of the roots. Some are held up
and vines wrapped around them and they are stapled

02:32:10.437 --> 02:32:17.910
at an angle onto the sides of the tree. They're
all currently placed as a warning to either notify

02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:21.110
or fend off anyone who would wander too close.

02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:26.094
LAURA: I don't think the fish people like the safe
house being here.

02:32:26.094 --> 02:32:29.190
MARISHA: Maybe they want the safe house for
themselves?

02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:35.984
LAURA: Maybe this tree is sacred and it was being
used as a safe house and that's not okay.

02:32:35.984 --> 02:32:37.970
TRAVIS: Certainly not welcome.

02:32:37.970 --> 02:32:41.225
TALIESIN: Would have been used as a safe house for
awhile I imagine, though.

02:32:41.225 --> 02:32:42.962
LIAM: The tree is not giving off anything, no?

02:32:42.962 --> 02:32:44.008
MATT: Nope.

02:32:44.008 --> 02:32:48.089
LAURA: Cali, can you make this water around the
tree go away?

02:32:48.089 --> 02:32:54.198
MARK: Yeah, actually, I think I should be able to
do something about that. I'll Shape Water and I

02:32:54.198 --> 02:32:59.250
can push it around in a five foot cube, so I can
part it a little bit. Or I can turn it clear as well.

02:32:59.250 --> 02:33:05.987
MATT: You can part areas of it, but it's about 15
feet across, as far as the width of it and it

02:33:05.987 --> 02:33:11.545
changes in width depending on which place on the
tree you head. It is, essentially, a waist-deep

02:33:11.545 --> 02:33:14.770
area of water. So you could move with it and--

02:33:14.770 --> 02:33:20.586
MARK: Can I shallow it and disperse it, so it
still has water, but it shrink it down five feet

02:33:20.586 --> 02:33:22.640
so it's not as deep to walk through?

02:33:22.713 --> 02:33:27.248
MATT: You can bring it to just past knee height
within a very localized area to you.

02:33:27.254 --> 02:33:29.990
MARK: That's about the best I can do Jester, I'm
sorry.

02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:32.746
LAURA: Oh, no, that's really impressive.

02:33:32.746 --> 02:33:36.928
SAM: I feel like Caleb could have done it.

02:33:36.928 --> 02:33:39.142
LAURA: Caleb, can you do that, too?

02:33:39.142 --> 02:33:40.450
LIAM: No. I do not know how to do it.

02:33:40.450 --> 02:33:41.870
LAURA: He can't do it, Nott.

02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:43.372
SAM: He's being modest. He could do it.

02:33:43.372 --> 02:33:46.025
LIAM: Nott, I have limitations. I can do many
things like you--

02:33:46.025 --> 02:33:48.713
SAM: Bren!

02:33:48.713 --> 02:33:57.449
LAURA: Should we try to go towards the tree?
Towards all the dead bodies?

02:33:57.449 --> 02:34:01.449
TRAVIS: Is the water around the tree in a circle,
like it pans out from around the side?

02:34:01.449 --> 02:34:04.663
MATT: Kind of. There's a big clearing around this
tree. It's natural for the most part, but it looks

02:34:04.663 --> 02:34:08.151
like this area is centered around the tree.

02:34:08.151 --> 02:34:12.993
MARISHA: Do I see anything like landmarks or
anything out of place surrounding the tree?

02:34:12.993 --> 02:34:15.590
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:16.854
LIAM: Is the water up to our waist now?

02:34:16.854 --> 02:34:20.951
MATT: Well no, you haven't submerged in the water
yet. But it looks about waist high as you lower

02:34:20.951 --> 02:34:22.165
the water level.

02:34:22.165 --> 02:34:26.997
MARISHA: It's all right. 14.

02:34:26.997 --> 02:34:35.324
MATT: You do glance up and see a band of teal
fabric tied around one of the branches or the

02:34:35.324 --> 02:34:41.025
edges of the roots at the top part about ten feet
up that has been weathered and dirtied from just

02:34:41.025 --> 02:34:46.569
being there for a long time. A lot of the color
has faded. But you just barely pick out its location.

02:34:46.569 --> 02:34:48.255
MARISHA: It's just one little ribbon?

02:34:48.255 --> 02:34:53.678
MATT: It looks like it might have been a bandana
that was wrapped and tied around a root above.

02:34:53.909 --> 02:34:57.220
MARISHA: I'm going to see if I can climb the tree
and get to it.

02:34:57.220 --> 02:35:01.053
MATT: Okay. So you wade through the water.

02:35:01.053 --> 02:35:05.496
TRAVIS: I'll go with her, just to accompany.

02:35:05.496 --> 02:35:08.760
TALIESIN: Nott, do you want to walk on top of the
water for a bit and keep an eye for anything

02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:11.262
underneath the surface?

02:35:11.262 --> 02:35:16.223
SAM: Well, what if something grabs me from under
the surface?

02:35:16.223 --> 02:35:20.878
TALIESIN: Well, what if something grabs you from
the shore? Like a troll.

02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:22.805
TRAVIS: Or when, if someone grabs you from the
shore.

02:35:22.805 --> 02:35:25.310
SAM: All right, I'll walk around.

02:35:25.310 --> 02:35:27.252
MARK: Is Nott a nickname for Bren?

02:35:27.252 --> 02:35:28.368
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:35:28.368 --> 02:35:32.118
MARK: That makes a lot more sense because you keep
calling her Nott and I just didn't get it.

02:35:32.118 --> 02:35:37.105
MARISHA: Sometimes we call her Nott Bren. Yeah.

02:35:37.105 --> 02:35:38.460
MARK: Okay. I mean, sure.

02:35:38.460 --> 02:35:40.710
TALIESIN: We were drunk at the time, it just sort
of happened.

02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:43.624
LIAM: She's as small as a tree knot, you know,
so-- cute.

02:35:43.624 --> 02:35:46.444
MARK: Oh, well Nott, if I'm allowed to call you
that--

02:35:46.444 --> 02:35:47.517
SAM: Sure.

02:35:47.517 --> 02:35:50.966
MARK: I can make the water clear so that you can
see if there's anything that could grab you.

02:35:50.966 --> 02:35:51.955
SAM: Oh!

02:35:51.955 --> 02:35:54.381
MARISHA: What was that thing you said about
honesty earlier? I can't remember.

02:35:54.381 --> 02:35:57.759
LIAM: You don't know any of the fact that I almost
killed you, Marisha Ray.

02:35:57.759 --> 02:36:01.021
MARISHA: I'm talking about before you almost
killed me when you had that great quote

02:36:01.021 --> 02:36:02.398
about honesty earlier.

02:36:02.398 --> 02:36:06.125
MATT: Beau, make an athletics check to try and
climb the tree.

02:36:06.125 --> 02:36:08.996
LIAM: Yeah, what I was trying to do for us?

02:36:08.996 --> 02:36:10.092
TRAVIS: Easiest to remember.

02:36:10.092 --> 02:36:11.326
LIAM and LAURA: Yeah.

02:36:11.326 --> 02:36:13.889
MARK: My wisdom is eight so I can't pick up on any
of this.

02:36:13.889 --> 02:36:15.681
MATT: Athletics. To climb the tree.

02:36:15.681 --> 02:36:18.303
LAURA: Huh? Damn.

02:36:18.303 --> 02:36:20.191
MARISHA: Eight.

02:36:20.191 --> 02:36:26.223
MATT: It takes a while to even get close, but the
general moisture in the air makes it slick and you

02:36:26.223 --> 02:36:27.866
keep slipping down the side.

02:36:27.866 --> 02:36:28.959
SAM: What's up there?

02:36:28.959 --> 02:36:30.656
MARISHA: Can I have Fjord give me a boost?

02:36:30.656 --> 02:36:31.690
SAM: What's up there?

02:36:31.690 --> 02:36:32.860
MATT: You can try. Roll--

02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:34.708
TRAVIS: There's a teal piece of fabric that's tied
up on a branch.

02:36:34.708 --> 02:36:35.928
MATT: A tiny piece of teal fabric tied--

02:36:35.928 --> 02:36:36.916
SAM: How far up?

02:36:36.916 --> 02:36:38.129
MATT: Eight to ten feet up.

02:36:38.129 --> 02:36:41.136
SAM: I'll just reach it with my Mage Hand.

02:36:41.136 --> 02:36:42.803
MATT: (popping noise) Do you untie it?

02:36:42.803 --> 02:36:43.628
SAM: Yeah.

02:36:43.628 --> 02:36:49.457
MATT: Okay. You pull it and you bring it down.
It's an old, starched, weathered bandana.

02:36:49.457 --> 02:36:52.104
TALIESIN: Why don't you try pulling on the branch
that it was tied to?

02:36:52.104 --> 02:36:53.718
SAM: All right.

02:36:53.718 --> 02:36:57.050
TRAVIS: How deep is the water without the water
being dispersed? Near the base of the tree.

02:36:57.050 --> 02:36:59.902
MATT: About three feet.

02:36:59.902 --> 02:37:03.029
TALIESIN: The water is now crystal clear, by the
way.

02:37:03.029 --> 02:37:10.691
MATT: Oh yeah, so now the water's clear and you
can see below there's thick sediment, muck, a few

02:37:10.691 --> 02:37:15.637
bones of some wayward creature that long has been
left to rot beneath the water but there's nothing

02:37:15.637 --> 02:37:25.252
living in there aside from toads, tadpoles, other
small slithering natural creatures that call the swamp home.

02:37:25.252 --> 02:37:31.276
MARK: I will lower it, now that I've seen it's
clear, and I'll say: Well, I'm happy to step in

02:37:31.276 --> 02:37:39.766
first. You guys were kind enough to bring me, I'm
happy to step through and make sure it's okay. I'll start.

02:37:39.766 --> 02:37:44.906
MATT: Okay, so you make your way through, catching
up to Beau and Fjord who are at the base of the

02:37:44.906 --> 02:37:48.356
tree. You get up to the base of the tree now. The
rest of you guys follow suit?

02:37:48.356 --> 02:37:49.787
LAURA: Yes.

02:37:49.787 --> 02:37:55.505
MATT: You all cross past the water path. You're
now at the base of the tree. You, Nott, have the

02:37:55.505 --> 02:37:59.932
strange teal faded scarf now in your grasp.

02:37:59.932 --> 02:38:01.019
SAM: It's just a scarf?

02:38:01.019 --> 02:38:01.732
MATT: Yeah.

02:38:01.732 --> 02:38:03.028
MARISHA: Nothing else has happened?

02:38:03.028 --> 02:38:04.653
SAM: You want me to pull on the branch?

02:38:04.653 --> 02:38:06.076
TALIESIN: Pull on the branch that it was tied to.

02:38:06.076 --> 02:38:06.979
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe it'll open something.

02:38:06.979 --> 02:38:08.611
SAM: I'll pull on that branch.

02:38:08.611 --> 02:38:10.033
TRAVIS: Oh jeez.

02:38:10.033 --> 02:38:14.175
SAM: Vigorously pull on it!

02:38:14.175 --> 02:38:16.291
LIAM: Maybe there's two branches.

02:38:16.291 --> 02:38:17.917
MATT: The gif machine.

02:38:17.917 --> 02:38:18.627
SAM: Huh?

02:38:18.627 --> 02:38:21.088
MATT: The gif machine, Sam Riegel.

02:38:21.088 --> 02:38:24.776
SAM: (strained yelling)

02:38:24.776 --> 02:38:33.030
MATT: Oh god. The branch itself is pretty sturdy.
The portions of the tree here do not bend very

02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:36.838
much and it doesn't seem to react. The strength of
the Mage Hand isn't very strong.

02:38:36.838 --> 02:38:39.866
LAURA: Are there any knots on the tree? Like
underneath where the ribbon was?

02:38:39.866 --> 02:38:41.871
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:38:41.871 --> 02:38:45.247
TALIESIN: What? Where did that even go?

02:38:45.247 --> 02:38:45.978
LAURA: It's right here.

02:38:45.978 --> 02:38:47.525
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:38:47.525 --> 02:38:48.772
LAURA: 12.

02:38:48.772 --> 02:38:55.851
MATT: 12? Yeah. You glance around and as you were
placing your hands against part of it some of it

02:38:55.851 --> 02:39:04.132
shifts, it wobbles. Now getting a glance, there's
a piece of weathered driftwood or separate wood

02:39:04.132 --> 02:39:09.594
that has been pressed up and tucked behind some of
the roots to look like it's part of the tree. But

02:39:09.594 --> 02:39:12.916
it's a little bit of a different texture, a
different type of wood and as you press on it, it

02:39:12.916 --> 02:39:14.575
wiggles. You shift it--

02:39:14.575 --> 02:39:16.209
TALIESIN: Traps!

02:39:16.209 --> 02:39:18.733
LAURA: Check for traps, Nott.

02:39:18.733 --> 02:39:20.399
SAM: All right.

02:39:20.399 --> 02:39:23.025
MARK: Truly blessed with such wisdom.

02:39:23.025 --> 02:39:24.547
SAM: I will check for traps.

02:39:24.547 --> 02:39:26.215
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:39:28.017 --> 02:39:30.152
SAM: 16? 16.

02:39:30.152 --> 02:39:32.369
MATT: 16. It does not appear to be trapped.

02:39:32.369 --> 02:39:33.825
LAURA: I'm going to move it then.

02:39:33.825 --> 02:39:35.087
SAM: Great.

02:39:35.087 --> 02:39:42.233
MATT: You wiggle it out, pull it free and now you
can see about a four-foot carved hollow in the

02:39:42.233 --> 02:39:44.785
tree that leads to a dark, lightless interior.

02:39:44.785 --> 02:39:46.658
SAM: You did it!

02:39:46.658 --> 02:39:49.180
LAURA: Well, you and Beau and me did it.

02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:50.401
SAM: But you did it.

02:39:50.401 --> 02:39:51.615
LAURA: Aww.

02:39:51.615 --> 02:39:52.327
SAM: With my help.

02:39:52.327 --> 02:39:53.664
LAURA: Right.

02:39:53.664 --> 02:39:56.346
TRAVIS: Nicely done. Who's first?

02:39:56.346 --> 02:39:59.506
MARISHA: I almost died today, motherfuckers, I
almost died.

02:39:59.506 --> 02:40:02.454
TALIESIN: Do you want to throw some light in
here?

02:40:02.454 --> 02:40:03.550
SAM: That was Caleb's fault.

02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:05.695
MARISHA: That was Caleb's fault, exactly, and I
can't remember the thing he said about honesty and remembering.

02:40:05.695 --> 02:40:12.800
LIAM: This is all meta conversation. You guys have
no idea that Liam almost used the wrong spell.

02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:15.268
Caleb was on point.

02:40:15.268 --> 02:40:17.643
MARK: I can go first and summon some light.

02:40:17.643 --> 02:40:19.299
LAURA: You can do light?

02:40:19.664 --> 02:40:20.577
MARK: Yeah.

02:40:20.577 --> 02:40:23.237
SAM: Yeah, Caleb can do light too; it's not the
greatest.

02:40:23.237 --> 02:40:28.658
TRAVIS: Wait, let's just hold on. I'll go in with
darkvision without setting off any lights that

02:40:28.658 --> 02:40:30.027
might herald them.

02:40:30.027 --> 02:40:31.917
LAURA: What if there's traps on the inside,
though?

02:40:31.917 --> 02:40:34.218
TRAVIS: Then I'll get hurt.

02:40:34.218 --> 02:40:39.861
MARK: Matt, I'll cast Light still behind these
guys, but it comes out of her draconic eye. She

02:40:39.861 --> 02:40:44.244
brushes her hair to the side and she has a yellow
draconic eye on her left side.

02:40:44.244 --> 02:40:47.705
MATT: All right. It glows like a torchlight in the
vicinity.

02:40:47.705 --> 02:40:49.595
LAURA: Cali, you're so cool.

02:40:49.595 --> 02:40:51.561
MARK: Thanks, Jester! You're so cute. I love it.

02:40:51.561 --> 02:40:53.313
LAURA: Thank you! I love you.

02:40:53.313 --> 02:40:55.556
MARK: Aww!

02:40:55.556 --> 02:41:04.573
MATT: As you step inside, Fjord, you notice a
fairly well-cleared interior that smells of marsh

02:41:04.573 --> 02:41:11.620
water and lamp oil. Glancing about, there are two
hooks on the wall that have been jammed in that

02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:17.042
carry the top part of some sort of oil lantern
that has been shattered against the wall. The

02:41:17.042 --> 02:41:26.346
glass itself is broken. The metal is bent and you
now can see there's some soaked lamp oil that has

02:41:26.346 --> 02:41:31.106
fallen from those impacts that has hit the ground
on the wall nearby and is offering that additional

02:41:31.106 --> 02:41:39.411
smell to the room. The floor is somewhat soggy
with moss and bits of sand and gravel as well as

02:41:39.411 --> 02:41:45.829
the occasional heavy root that breaks through the
surface of that soft floor. There are some pieces

02:41:45.829 --> 02:41:50.821
of broken wood slats, but besides that, the
chamber appears to be empty.

02:41:50.821 --> 02:41:58.653
TRAVIS: I don't see anything inside here. Looks
like there was a broken lamp, so careful with fire.

02:41:58.653 --> 02:42:01.569
MARK: There's got to be more here, right? This
can't be it.

02:42:01.569 --> 02:42:03.586
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll push in a little bit more.

02:42:03.586 --> 02:42:08.690
MATT: Okay. You're now stepping into the chamber.
The chamber's about 30 feet wide. It's just round.

02:42:08.690 --> 02:42:09.878
TRAVIS: Looking up?

02:42:09.878 --> 02:42:14.370
MATT: You look up. The ceiling's about 12 feet
tall and there's some hanging roots that are

02:42:14.370 --> 02:42:19.985
dangling from the top. It looks like it's been
carved away maybe.

02:42:19.985 --> 02:42:22.249
MARISHA: Does it feel like it's bigger on the
inside?

02:42:22.249 --> 02:42:27.620
MATT: No. It matches the size. It's probably about
two feet to three feet of thickness of the actual

02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:30.832
tree trunk and the interior's hollow.

02:42:30.832 --> 02:42:33.177
TRAVIS: Do I notice any furniture, articles,
clothing?

02:42:33.177 --> 02:42:35.149
MATT: No. Make an investigation check if you want
to.

02:42:35.149 --> 02:42:40.694
LAURA: Are there any trap doors on the floor?

02:42:40.694 --> 02:42:42.173
TRAVIS: 17.

02:42:42.173 --> 02:42:46.835
MATT: Okay. A couple things. Though you don't have
a sense of color-- are you the only one in the

02:42:46.835 --> 02:42:48.179
chamber right now?

02:42:48.179 --> 02:42:49.572
TRAVIS: I believe Cali.

02:42:49.572 --> 02:42:50.516
ASHLEY: I was behind.

02:42:50.516 --> 02:42:51.216
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're in there as well.

02:42:51.216 --> 02:42:53.288
MATT: You went in there as well?

02:42:53.288 --> 02:42:54.320
MARK: Yeah, to give them light.

02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:56.674
MATT: Right. The rest of you guys step into the
chamber and the light comes in. What you failed to

02:42:56.674 --> 02:43:01.088
see because it was a change of color becomes
immediately apparent. There are scattered splashes

02:43:01.088 --> 02:43:10.224
of blood across areas of the walls inside. They're
dried, but dried enough to the point where they

02:43:10.224 --> 02:43:17.549
haven't gone completely black and then
disintegrated. So this is relatively recent, weeks

02:43:17.549 --> 02:43:23.715
maybe. As you guys are inspecting the space, there
are certain gashes against-- it looks like there

02:43:23.715 --> 02:43:30.927
was definitely a fight and scuffle. The soft
ground here has signs of turbulent movement as

02:43:30.927 --> 02:43:38.893
well as a number of smeared grooves in the ground
that snake and spiral about.

02:43:38.893 --> 02:43:40.952
LIAM: Are there any immediate threats in there,
Fjord?

02:43:40.952 --> 02:43:42.526
TRAVIS: Not that I can see.

02:43:42.526 --> 02:43:45.257
MATT: Fjord, as you're glancing about answering
this question, you look down on the far north

02:43:45.257 --> 02:43:49.465
corner of it and where some of the roots have
gathered and come down, there's one space where

02:43:49.465 --> 02:43:54.455
you don't see the wall of the tree behind it. As
you move the root out of the way, there is an

02:43:54.455 --> 02:44:00.247
actual hole about two and a half feet wide that
descends below the tree.

02:44:00.247 --> 02:44:04.295
TRAVIS: Not any danger in the chamber, but it
looks like there's more to this room.

02:44:04.295 --> 02:44:07.978
MARK: Does it look like they were dragging bodies
down there? The blood streaks and stuff.

02:44:07.978 --> 02:44:09.783
TRAVIS: Could've been.

02:44:09.783 --> 02:44:10.759
MARK: Do they lead there?

02:44:10.759 --> 02:44:12.850
MARISHA: Yeah, do the tracks lead to the hole?

02:44:12.850 --> 02:44:16.269
MATT: There are some spatters of blood and there
are some things that give the sign of being pulled

02:44:16.269 --> 02:44:23.581
on as well as pieces and shards of wood, including
bits of porcelain, some object that had shattered

02:44:23.581 --> 02:44:28.370
and broken. Looks like whatever may have been
within this chamber at some point, a lot of it's

02:44:28.370 --> 02:44:30.347
been brought down there.

02:44:30.347 --> 02:44:33.881
TRAVIS: Nott Bren, you're up.

02:44:33.881 --> 02:44:35.246
SAM: I've got to go down there?

02:44:35.246 --> 02:44:36.174
TRAVIS: Yep. By yourself.

02:44:36.174 --> 02:44:38.916
LAURA: That's where the fish people live! Are
there fish scales on the ground?

02:44:38.916 --> 02:44:39.867
MARK: Do you need light?

02:44:39.867 --> 02:44:40.685
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:44:40.685 --> 02:44:41.747
SAM: That would help.

02:44:41.747 --> 02:44:46.621
TALIESIN: I'll help with this one. Smelling the
air for fishy. Oh, doesn't matter anyway.

02:44:46.621 --> 02:44:48.009
LAURA: 17.

02:44:48.009 --> 02:44:56.883
MATT: You do manage to pull through. You do see a
small piece of thick scaled hide that was carved

02:44:56.883 --> 02:44:59.087
off, probably as part of a scuffle.

02:44:59.087 --> 02:45:01.121
LAURA: Fish skin!

02:45:01.121 --> 02:45:02.268
MATT: It's pretty tough.

02:45:02.268 --> 02:45:04.164
LAURA: It's tough.

02:45:04.164 --> 02:45:05.756
MATT: It's salty.

02:45:05.756 --> 02:45:07.179
LAURA: It's kind of salty.

02:45:07.179 --> 02:45:08.820
MARISHA: Tuna? Salmon?

02:45:08.820 --> 02:45:10.006
LAURA: Smells like fish.

02:45:10.006 --> 02:45:11.215
TRAVIS: Brackish flesh?

02:45:11.215 --> 02:45:12.658
LAURA: I'm going to put it in my bag.

02:45:12.658 --> 02:45:14.329
TRAVIS: Gross.

02:45:14.329 --> 02:45:21.325
MARISHA: Before we go down or as these guys go
down, can I take a lap and look at the bodies on

02:45:21.325 --> 02:45:24.602
the outside and see if I recognize any of them?

02:45:24.602 --> 02:45:25.788
MATT: Recognize any of the bodies?

02:45:25.788 --> 02:45:27.220
MARISHA: The six bodies.

02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:28.363
LIAM: Outside.

02:45:28.363 --> 02:45:31.943
MATT: Okay. Glancing past and taking a look;
there's nobody that you've seen before that is

02:45:31.943 --> 02:45:39.700
amongst this crew. They all appear to be darkly
dressed, generally to keep out of sight. You do

02:45:39.700 --> 02:45:46.411
see two of the members there that have an
accumulation of neck tattoos. You've seen the ones

02:45:46.411 --> 02:45:51.764
back in Zadash that were almost full bands of
designs. These individuals have only sections of

02:45:51.764 --> 02:45:56.324
it. You start getting the idea that the more
they've worked with whatever organization that

02:45:56.324 --> 02:46:00.493
work this is, the more completion they've had of
certain jobs depending on what the job is, a

02:46:00.493 --> 02:46:04.407
certain type of individual acquires tattoos as a
sign of how long they've been there and how

02:46:04.407 --> 02:46:06.299
successful they've been.

02:46:06.299 --> 02:46:10.948
MARISHA: That's cool. Okay. So they all seem like
smugglers?

02:46:10.948 --> 02:46:14.548
MATT: At one point possibly.

02:46:14.548 --> 02:46:16.309
MARISHA: Can I do a quick round of their pockets?

02:46:16.309 --> 02:46:17.614
MATT: Investigation check.

02:46:17.614 --> 02:46:19.473
MARISHA: Okay. Just real quick!

02:46:19.473 --> 02:46:20.913
MATT: With disadvantage, because it's quick.

02:46:20.913 --> 02:46:25.103
LIAM: --and puts light up in the tree out there
with her.

02:46:25.103 --> 02:46:25.987
MATT: What's that?

02:46:25.987 --> 02:46:30.371
LIAM: I'm outside with her and I'm casting Dancing
Lights into the trees so that she can see better.

02:46:30.371 --> 02:46:31.181
MATT: Okay.

02:46:31.181 --> 02:46:32.217
MARISHA: 13.

02:46:32.217 --> 02:46:36.819
MATT: 13. You manage to scrape away about 17 gold
pieces and five silver pieces.

02:46:36.819 --> 02:46:38.908
MARISHA: I'll take that.

02:46:38.908 --> 02:46:44.290
MATT: Before, as you pull off of it, you watch as
the lower half of the body sloughs off the torso

02:46:44.290 --> 02:46:46.257
and you back away.

02:46:46.257 --> 02:46:47.779
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:46:47.779 --> 02:46:52.937
MATT: The smell is awful, as a lot of the interior
gas of the bloated corpse escapes into this

02:46:52.937 --> 02:46:55.648
terrible sulfurous stench.

02:46:55.648 --> 02:46:56.915
SAM: Gross.

02:46:56.915 --> 02:46:58.257
MARISHA: Oh god.

02:46:58.257 --> 02:47:04.210
LIAM: Please, we have been around death plenty of
times. Caleb throws up quietly into the water.

02:47:04.210 --> 02:47:06.456
TALIESIN: Do you go back and forth?

02:47:06.456 --> 02:47:10.498
TRAVIS: Well, only one place to go and that's
down.

02:47:10.498 --> 02:47:15.990
SAM: Wait! I'm just going to take a quick minute
to stare into the eternal abyss of the dodecahedron.

02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:17.890
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

02:47:17.890 --> 02:47:19.789
LAURA: I just open up the bag so you can see it.

02:47:19.789 --> 02:47:23.067
SAM: Oh my god what is in there?!

02:47:23.067 --> 02:47:26.778
LAURA: We don't let Cali see it. Sorry, Cali.

02:47:26.778 --> 02:47:33.085
MATT: Okay. You take a moment to focus and place
your hand on this lightly thrumming device. Your

02:47:33.085 --> 02:47:39.988
vision is pulled into this universal space of
stars and gas and distant existences you've never

02:47:39.988 --> 02:47:46.164
contemplated and there you see before you the
pulsing light of possibility. You reach out a hand

02:47:46.164 --> 02:47:51.467
and grasp it and feel it enter your body and
you've acquired your fragment of possibility.

02:47:51.467 --> 02:47:56.589
MARK: It doesn't take much to distract Cali. You
just point over there and she's like--

02:47:56.589 --> 02:47:59.423
SAM: I'll take a swig and go down the hole.

02:47:59.423 --> 02:48:08.681
MATT: The hole has chunks of rock and dirt as well
as a very interwoven network of roots coming down

02:48:08.681 --> 02:48:13.493
from the tree, so it's fairly easy to climb down.
There is a little bit of that damp water and

02:48:13.493 --> 02:48:20.100
moisture that seeped into the chamber previously
from just being near the swamp. It wasn't a thick

02:48:20.100 --> 02:48:24.705
layer of water, maybe half an inch or so in the
actual portions of the chamber and some of it is

02:48:24.705 --> 02:48:28.540
now heading down. As you're climbing down
carefully through this hole, you can feel it

02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:35.765
running down your back and it's this cold swamp
water. I need you to make an athletics check as

02:48:35.765 --> 02:48:38.119
you make your way down this chamber.

02:48:38.119 --> 02:48:41.187
SAM: Not great. Just a check?

02:48:41.187 --> 02:48:42.508
MATT: Yep. Just add your athletics.

02:48:42.508 --> 02:48:43.404
SAM: Seven.

02:48:43.404 --> 02:48:53.549
MATT: Seven. Okay. You begin to-- (grunts) and you
lose your grip and begin slide down like a slide.

02:48:53.549 --> 02:48:58.166
SAM: (whispers) Yes. (screams)

02:48:58.166 --> 02:49:04.322
MATT: (impact) You get about maybe 15 or so feet
before the back of the slide leaves you. You have

02:49:04.322 --> 02:49:08.682
darkvision, so you see the interior of some sort
of chamber in the ground rocketing towards you--

02:49:08.682 --> 02:49:11.338
SAM: I will throw out a feather and cast Feather
Fall.

02:49:11.338 --> 02:49:20.681
MATT: Okay. And you gingerly land on your feet. No
damage taken. And no noise made either.

02:49:20.681 --> 02:49:25.153
SAM: (breathing heavily)

02:49:25.153 --> 02:49:30.565
MATT: Looking around you, you see the inside of a
natural rock chamber. You can hear in the distance

02:49:30.565 --> 02:49:37.099
a rummaging sound, some shifting over from around
the corner. It seems like from where you're

02:49:37.099 --> 02:49:42.190
landing the back is around you and then it curves
to the left. You see a faint puddle before you

02:49:42.190 --> 02:49:48.875
lose vision and beyond that, you don't see
anything but you hear (shifting).

02:49:48.875 --> 02:49:50.757
SAM: Coming towards me or just moving?

02:49:50.757 --> 02:49:52.174
MATT: Just echoing around the side.

02:49:52.174 --> 02:49:53.282
SAM: Cool.

02:49:53.282 --> 02:49:57.987
MATT: You hear a (monster hissing).

02:49:57.987 --> 02:49:59.250
SAM: Oh god.

02:49:59.250 --> 02:50:03.471
MATT: Something clatter to the ground. What are
the rest of you guys doing?

02:50:03.471 --> 02:50:09.488
TALIESIN: Do we hear the slip and the whoosh?

02:50:09.488 --> 02:50:12.294
MATT: I don't think you heard anything, no.

02:50:12.294 --> 02:50:14.824
LAURA: We should send a message to Nott and see
what she sees.

02:50:14.824 --> 02:50:15.725
MARK: What, Bren?

02:50:15.725 --> 02:50:17.466
MARISHA: Nott Bren, yeah.

02:50:17.466 --> 02:50:19.729
LIAM: Yeah, I can do that.

02:50:19.729 --> 02:50:21.468
MARK: Bren, are you down there? Hello?

02:50:21.468 --> 02:50:22.977
SAM: Are you sending a message?

02:50:22.977 --> 02:50:27.357
LIAM: Yeah, I am. I have just joined the group.
How are you doing down there, what do you see?

02:50:27.357 --> 02:50:29.740
SAM: I will reply to that message.

02:50:29.740 --> 02:50:32.686
LIAM: With you and me, it goes back and forth.

02:50:32.686 --> 02:50:37.985
SAM: There's a creature down here. I don't want to
make any noise. If you're going to come down to

02:50:37.985 --> 02:50:41.821
join me, use a rope.

02:50:41.821 --> 02:50:47.836
LIAM: All right, we can do that. Just stay put,
don't go rushing in without us.

02:50:47.836 --> 02:50:49.724
Is it one or more than one?

02:50:49.724 --> 02:50:52.255
SAM: I don't know. I'll go rushing in and find
out.

02:50:52.255 --> 02:50:56.517
LIAM: That's the opposite of what I said!

02:50:56.517 --> 02:50:59.672
SAM: I'm going to gingerly creep around the
corner.

02:50:59.672 --> 02:51:02.519
MATT: Make a stealth check for me, please.

02:51:02.519 --> 02:51:05.015
LIAM: It's hard to resist sneaking in.

02:51:05.015 --> 02:51:06.777
LAURA: Let's climb down.

02:51:06.777 --> 02:51:07.895
SAM: 15.

02:51:07.895 --> 02:51:15.248
MATT: You slowly make your way around the side.
This chamber appears to be kidney shaped. It

02:51:15.248 --> 02:51:21.672
curves around the bend, and as you make your way
around the chamber, at the outskirts of your

02:51:21.672 --> 02:51:30.176
darkvision, you begin to make out three shapes.
Humanoid torsos with long fins that extend from

02:51:30.176 --> 02:51:40.001
where the elbows are, patchwork leather and bronze
armor pieces, as well as hints of shell jewelry

02:51:40.001 --> 02:51:46.359
and bone. You can see one face as you peek around
the edge, and you can see this large, toothy

02:51:46.359 --> 02:51:52.191
underbite, with this square jaw where these four
tendrils kind of dangle from the tip of its chin.

02:51:52.191 --> 02:51:58.585
A single fin curves over the top of its head. No
nose, but two gleaming eyes that refract. What

02:51:58.585 --> 02:52:06.425
little bit of light coming into the chamber from
something out of the visual range is giving off a

02:52:06.425 --> 02:52:15.845
faint glow. The lower half of its body is a long
fish tail. It looks like that a nightmare-ish

02:52:15.845 --> 02:52:23.870
merman would look like. It sits there clutching
some sort of long harpoon-like pike with a hook on

02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:25.797
the end of it.

02:52:25.797 --> 02:52:28.653
SAM: Are they waiting, are they talking, what are
they doing?

02:52:28.653 --> 02:52:34.745
MATT: They're talking amongst themselves, and you
hear some sort of tearing sound, you peek around a

02:52:34.745 --> 02:52:46.619
little further, and you can see a creature has
been dragged down here. A familiar one. A thick,

02:52:46.619 --> 02:52:53.865
leathery-scaled body of a crocodile of some kind.
Not a large one, but a regular sized crocodile has

02:52:53.865 --> 02:52:57.819
been dragged down here, and all three of them are
in the process of feasting on its body. They're

02:52:57.819 --> 02:53:02.909
tearing into its flesh, and talking amongst
themselves in a language you don't understand.

02:53:02.909 --> 02:53:09.287
Around the base of them, you see broken crates and
a few odds and ends are

02:53:09.287 --> 02:53:11.888
resting on the ground, loosely discarded.

02:53:11.888 --> 02:53:13.987
SAM: Any other entrances or exits?

02:53:13.987 --> 02:53:17.468
MATT: From what you can see? You're kind of
peeking around the corner, you cannot see the

02:53:17.468 --> 02:53:21.667
opposite end of where this curvature is without
possibly revealing yourself.

02:53:21.667 --> 02:53:24.236
LIAM: It has been a while, what would you like us
to do?

02:53:24.236 --> 02:53:27.201
SAM: Anywhere else to hide, or something to hide
behind?

02:53:27.201 --> 02:53:32.787
MATT: Around that way? Not terribly. There are a
few outcropping walls, and at this point I would

02:53:32.787 --> 02:53:34.571
say I could probably give you a visual.

02:53:34.571 --> 02:53:37.936
LIAM: Already?

02:53:37.936 --> 02:53:45.706
TRAVIS: I like what I'm hearing! Shark fins and
shit?! I'm a happy camper.

02:53:45.706 --> 02:53:49.711
SAM: While you're setting the stage, I'll message
back up to them.

02:53:49.711 --> 02:53:56.266
MARISHA: Oh, what is that, what are they riding?
They're riding like watery penises.

02:53:56.266 --> 02:53:58.997
MATT: Nott, you're right there, curving around the
side.

02:53:58.997 --> 02:54:00.452
SAM: Did I come down right where I am?

02:54:00.452 --> 02:54:03.546
MATT: You landed right here and then made your way
around. This is where it drops you into the middle

02:54:03.546 --> 02:54:04.543
of the chamber.

02:54:04.543 --> 02:54:12.253
SAM: Got it. I'll radio back up to the top and
say: There are three mermen down here with

02:54:12.253 --> 02:54:21.222
dangerous weapons. I am very outnumbered. Please
come quickly, you can reply to this message.

02:54:21.222 --> 02:54:24.877
LIAM: Yeah, we've established that. Stay put,
don't move.

02:54:24.877 --> 02:54:30.947
SAM: I'll cast Mage Hand and take a ball bearing
across the way, but not dropping it, just holding

02:54:30.947 --> 02:54:33.208
it in place, just in case.

02:54:33.208 --> 02:54:35.623
MATT: Okay. So who's going down?

02:54:35.623 --> 02:54:37.512
LIAM: I drop Frumpkin down the shoot.

02:54:37.512 --> 02:54:39.878
SAM: Oh Jesus, he's going to die!

02:54:39.878 --> 02:54:41.649
LIAM: No, he's not.

02:54:41.649 --> 02:54:43.125
LAURA: That's not a long fall for a cat.

02:54:43.125 --> 02:54:44.919
TRAVIS: We're going to find out how far.

02:54:44.919 --> 02:54:47.120
MARISHA: Not within like 50 feet.

02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:48.421
LIAM: Yes, they can.

02:54:48.421 --> 02:54:54.226
MATT: Yeah they can, most of them. Make an
acrobatics check for me.

02:54:54.226 --> 02:54:56.991
LAURA: Can we start tying a rope off upstairs and
drop it down?

02:54:56.991 --> 02:54:58.370
MATT: Sure.

02:54:58.370 --> 02:54:59.980
LIAM: My acrobatics or the cat's?

02:54:59.980 --> 02:55:00.886
MATT: The cat's acrobatics.

02:55:00.886 --> 02:55:02.674
LIAM: Oh great, hold on, I've got that pulled up
right here, hold on.

02:55:02.674 --> 02:55:05.327
MARISHA: Are you going to land on your feet for
the cat?

02:55:05.327 --> 02:55:06.517
LIAM: 16.

02:55:06.517 --> 02:55:11.917
MATT: Frumpkin lands.

02:55:11.917 --> 02:55:13.998
LAURA: We've tied our ropes together and we're
going to go down.

02:55:13.998 --> 02:55:15.407
MATT: Okay.

02:55:15.407 --> 02:55:17.074
TRAVIS: Double knot.

02:55:17.178 --> 02:55:18.817
MATT: Double knot? All right.

02:55:18.817 --> 02:55:20.432
MARISHA: I can go down first and make sure it's
secure on the other end.

02:55:20.432 --> 02:55:21.770
SAM: Sailors' knot.

02:55:21.770 --> 02:55:26.371
MATT: All right. You make your way down the rope.
Eventually you get to the bottom. It does dangle

02:55:26.371 --> 02:55:31.539
and the edge of the rope does, basically, end
about a foot or two above where the ground is. So

02:55:31.539 --> 02:55:36.300
you just manage to catch the bottom. So put how
many ropes together? Two 50 feet ropes? Oh, so no.

02:55:36.300 --> 02:55:42.180
It's actually coiled at the bottom. Total, it's
about a 60-foot way down. You manage to make you

02:55:42.180 --> 02:55:43.483
way down without an issue.

02:55:43.483 --> 02:55:44.835
MARISHA: Yeah, I help anyone else down.

02:55:44.835 --> 02:55:49.541
MATT: Okay. So with the rope and everything,
aiding you down here, it's easy enough for you all

02:55:49.541 --> 02:55:52.968
to make your way into this area.

02:55:52.968 --> 02:55:57.247
SAM: Oh boy, they have all of us all crammed up in
this little space.

02:55:57.247 --> 02:55:59.065
LAURA: What else are we going to do?

02:55:59.065 --> 02:56:02.039
TALIESIN: I'm going to point out, we can't
retreat.

02:56:02.039 --> 02:56:03.397
LAURA: Why?

02:56:03.397 --> 02:56:04.965
MATT: Kiri's coming down with you?

02:56:04.965 --> 02:56:11.845
SAM: No, wait. We're not bringing Kiri down, are
we? Are you guys bringing Kiri down?

02:56:11.845 --> 02:56:12.926
LIAM: I don't know.

02:56:12.926 --> 02:56:14.170
SAM: Oh my god.

02:56:14.170 --> 02:56:18.363
LAURA: We can't leave Kiri up there. Who knows
what's up there?

02:56:18.363 --> 02:56:19.737
MATT: Are you guys having this conversation?

02:56:19.737 --> 02:56:20.709
TALIESIN: No.

02:56:20.709 --> 02:56:21.968
LAURA: We had it upstairs. Kiri!

02:56:21.968 --> 02:56:24.567
MATT: (chirping)

02:56:24.567 --> 02:56:27.842
LAURA: (shushing) Sit in this corner.

02:56:27.842 --> 02:56:29.115
MATT: (like Cali) "I killed people."

02:56:29.115 --> 02:56:32.619
LAURA: (shushing) No. Sit in the corner, Kiri,
right here.

02:56:32.619 --> 02:56:34.408
MATT: (chirping)

02:56:34.408 --> 02:56:37.794
LAURA: Don't move unless something chases you.

02:56:37.794 --> 02:56:39.463
MATT: (like Jester) "Don't move unless something
chases you."

02:56:39.463 --> 02:56:40.488
LAURA: Right.

02:56:40.488 --> 02:56:41.893
MATT: (like Jester) "Right."

02:56:41.893 --> 02:56:44.632
ASHLEY: What if she dies?

02:56:44.632 --> 02:56:45.955
MATT: Holds the dagger in front of her.

02:56:45.955 --> 02:56:46.903
TALIESIN: She's upstairs.

02:56:46.903 --> 02:56:47.961
LAURA: She's down here with us.

02:56:47.961 --> 02:56:49.303
ASHLEY: She's down here with us, in the corner?

02:56:49.303 --> 02:56:50.124
LAURA: Right.

02:56:50.124 --> 02:56:51.481
MATT: Yeah, so Kiri is going to go ahead and duck
into this corner, here.

02:56:51.481 --> 02:56:52.602
ASHLEY: She's better not die.

02:56:52.602 --> 02:56:54.491
LIAM: Oh, wait. Kiri is down here with us in the
corner?

02:56:54.491 --> 02:56:56.212
LAURA: Yeah.

02:56:56.622 --> 02:56:58.614
MATT: All right, what are you guys doing?

02:56:58.614 --> 02:57:00.577
LAURA: Let's kill the fish people.

02:57:00.577 --> 02:57:03.448
MARISHA: Okay, we're going to go. We're doing
this.

02:57:03.448 --> 02:57:06.375
MARK: Do you want me to start this explosively?

02:57:06.375 --> 02:57:07.514
LAURA: Yeah!

02:57:07.514 --> 02:57:08.771
MARISHA: I mean.

02:57:08.771 --> 02:57:11.296
MARK: I mean, I'm asking.

02:57:11.296 --> 02:57:12.901
TRAVIS: It is kind of enclosed.

02:57:12.901 --> 02:57:19.159
LIAM: Well, I think that's a great idea, but we
should also send Bren with you, and if you guys

02:57:19.159 --> 02:57:25.385
could go simultaneous, like. Maybe if Bren hit one
of them, and then you follow right away.

02:57:25.385 --> 02:57:32.700
MARK: Ooh! It might manage the goods that Bren
told us about that are around the corner. Like all

02:57:32.700 --> 02:57:37.625
the crates and stuff. I mean, my bowls should be
okay, but are you here for something?

02:57:37.625 --> 02:57:43.469
LIAM: Sometimes I'm able to focus just shy of what
I'm trying to target.

02:57:43.469 --> 02:57:49.592
MARK: Oh, it's a pretty tight space around there,
I'm not sure! I could try.

02:57:49.592 --> 02:57:53.250
MARISHA: If your bowls are magical, though, they
should survive, right?

02:57:53.250 --> 02:57:55.794
MARK: Yeah, I know. They should be fine, but I
mean for you guys, what do you want?

02:57:55.794 --> 02:57:59.068
LAURA: What if we all jump out at the same time
and scream and attack at the same time.

02:57:59.068 --> 02:58:00.080
TRAVIS: I like that idea.

02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:01.639
MARISHA: Yeah, let's ambush.

02:58:01.639 --> 02:58:02.876
LAURA: Like three, two, one.

02:58:02.876 --> 02:58:04.233
MARISHA: (quiet yell) Yeah.

02:58:04.233 --> 02:58:10.216
LIAM: I still think that these two would be good
to lead that charge.

02:58:10.216 --> 02:58:13.081
MARISHA: Give the explosive things--

02:58:13.081 --> 02:58:15.014
LAURA: We shouldn't do explosive because--

02:58:15.014 --> 02:58:16.819
MATT: Nott, you're watching.

02:58:16.819 --> 02:58:19.329
SAM: Uh-oh. Something's happening.

02:58:19.329 --> 02:58:27.482
MATT: You hear the splashing of water and out from
the side, another one emerges from this side pool.

02:58:27.482 --> 02:58:35.928
It (speaking in Aquan). The other one (speaking in
Aquan). It turns around and splashes back into

02:58:35.928 --> 02:58:43.980
this little pool and vanishes below the surface.

02:58:43.980 --> 02:58:48.620
SAM: Is there anyway to freeze the water or get
rid of the water?

02:58:48.620 --> 02:58:50.892
MARISHA: Yeah, dry up the water!

02:58:50.892 --> 02:58:53.417
LIAM: Are they still talking?

02:58:53.417 --> 02:58:56.443
MATT: Briefly chatting, but in the process of
eating, more than anything.

02:58:56.443 --> 02:59:00.712
MARK: I think I could freeze about five-foot,
that's the amount I can do.

02:59:00.712 --> 02:59:05.188
SAM: There's a pool in the back there. That's
where they entered and exited from.

02:59:05.188 --> 02:59:07.754
MATT: It's about ten square feet.

02:59:07.754 --> 02:59:14.346
MARK: I can freeze half of it. It's oddly specific
how much I can freeze.

02:59:14.346 --> 02:59:17.987
LIAM: Does anyone want to try to talk to these
things, or are we just (cutting)?

02:59:17.987 --> 02:59:19.887
MARK: They look like murderous fish men.

02:59:19.887 --> 02:59:22.095
TRAVIS: We're good to fuck them up, I think.

02:59:22.095 --> 02:59:23.259
MARK: We could try!

02:59:23.259 --> 02:59:25.077
TRAVIS: No, I don't think that's a good idea.

02:59:25.077 --> 02:59:26.298
LIAM: I like how that sounds. (like Cali)
Murderous fish men.

02:59:26.298 --> 02:59:27.226
MARK: Murderous fish men!

02:59:27.226 --> 02:59:29.320
LIAM: I love it.

02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:30.897
MARK: Have any of you seen Thor: Ragnarok?

02:59:30.897 --> 02:59:34.908
MARISHA: Yeah! I was going to say, you sound like
them, I love it!

02:59:34.908 --> 02:59:40.155
TRAVIS: I could blind them.

02:59:40.155 --> 02:59:42.093
SAM: Don't you speak fish?

02:59:42.093 --> 02:59:43.450
TRAVIS: What?

02:59:43.450 --> 02:59:45.229
SAM: You're half fish!

02:59:45.229 --> 02:59:46.518
MARK: You're half fish?

02:59:46.518 --> 02:59:48.883
TRAVIS: I'm not half fish, I'm half-orc!

02:59:48.883 --> 02:59:50.250
SAM: He was born underwater!

02:59:50.250 --> 02:59:53.688
TRAVIS: That is actually not true at all. Nott,
not at all.

02:59:53.688 --> 02:59:55.303
SAM: What is the other half?

02:59:55.303 --> 02:59:56.456
ASHLEY: You're half-orc, but what's the other
half?

02:59:56.456 --> 02:59:58.136
TRAVIS: Half-human, I'd assume.

02:59:58.136 --> 02:59:59.710
MARISHA and ASHLEY: You assume.

02:59:59.710 --> 03:00:02.164
LIAM: We're glossing over it, but we've seen you
vomit sea water twice.

03:00:02.164 --> 03:00:04.449
TRAVIS: Once.

03:00:04.449 --> 03:00:06.857
LAURA: Is this really the moment to talk about
this?

03:00:06.967 --> 03:00:09.570
MARK: Jester's really smart!

03:00:09.570 --> 03:00:11.373
ASHLEY: Right now's the moment.

03:00:11.373 --> 03:00:12.918
TRAVIS: Right now?

03:00:12.918 --> 03:00:14.467
SAM: Quick, tell us your backstory!

03:00:14.467 --> 03:00:20.633
MARISHA: You know how under pressure, you can
discover hidden talent? Maybe if you do this,

03:00:20.633 --> 03:00:23.761
you'll be like: Oh, I never knew this fishman side
of me!

03:00:23.761 --> 03:00:25.348
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check.

03:00:25.348 --> 03:00:28.243
LAURA: Oh, jeez. We're losing our ambush, y'all.

03:00:28.243 --> 03:00:37.458
SAM: Someone create a distraction! We'll pop out
and kill it.

03:00:37.458 --> 03:00:40.115
ASHLEY: I rolled a six.

03:00:40.115 --> 03:00:41.888
MATT: What was the number you rolled?

03:00:41.888 --> 03:00:43.123
ASHLEY: It was a four.

03:00:43.123 --> 03:00:44.338
MATT: Okay, so that's six.

03:00:44.338 --> 03:00:47.414
TALIESIN: 15. I've already activated a sword.

03:00:47.414 --> 03:00:48.312
LAURA: Ten.

03:00:48.342 --> 03:00:50.115
SAM: 15.

03:00:50.115 --> 03:00:51.578
MARK: 14.

03:00:51.578 --> 03:00:52.798
LIAM: Drei.

03:00:52.798 --> 03:00:55.182
MARISHA: 18.

03:00:55.182 --> 03:00:56.281
TRAVIS: 13.

03:00:56.281 --> 03:00:58.293
SAM: Okay, average, average.

03:00:58.293 --> 03:00:59.978
LAURA: Oh no.

03:01:01.704 --> 03:01:07.675
MATT: As they're all eating, and Nott, you're
paying attention, one goes, (inquisitive growl,

03:01:07.688 --> 03:01:11.884
garbled speech)

03:01:11.884 --> 03:01:13.226
SAM: Three, two, one, go!

03:01:13.226 --> 03:01:15.280
(yelling)

03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:22.430
SAM: I'm going to Mage Hand throw the ball bearing
first, just as a signal to go. On the three-two-one.

03:01:22.430 --> 03:01:24.528
LAURA: And then we jump out.

03:01:24.528 --> 03:01:27.649
MATT: All right. So you throw the ball bearings,
and then everyone rolls initiative. You lost the

03:01:27.764 --> 03:01:32.925
surprise round, unfortunately. You were spending
too much time talking.

03:01:32.925 --> 03:01:38.235
ASHLEY: We're trying to get backstory!

03:01:38.235 --> 03:01:48.991
SAM: Half-carp, half-orc. Orcarp. Carporc?
Corpor.

03:01:50.285 --> 03:01:53.246
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody?

03:01:53.246 --> 03:01:56.754
MARISHA: I'm-- wait, 25 to 20? No.

03:01:56.754 --> 03:01:58.867
LAURA: Nobody? Nobody, huh?

03:01:58.867 --> 03:01:59.994
MATT: 20 to 15.

03:01:59.994 --> 03:02:00.717
TRAVIS: 18.

03:02:00.717 --> 03:02:01.622
MARISHA: 19.

03:02:01.622 --> 03:02:02.547
TALIESIN: 16.

03:02:02.547 --> 03:02:11.956
MATT: Okay, so we have Beau, Fjord-- what did you
get? 18. And then Molly at 16. 15 to ten?

03:02:11.956 --> 03:02:13.363
LIAM: Zehn.

03:02:13.363 --> 03:02:13.963
SAM: Ten.

03:02:13.963 --> 03:02:15.181
ASHLEY: 13.

03:02:15.181 --> 03:02:18.041
SAM: Wow, Ashley!

03:02:18.041 --> 03:02:23.951
LIAM: Yasha, and then Nott and Caleb are equal.

03:02:23.951 --> 03:02:25.704
MATT: And then, what was it, Caleb and Nott?

03:02:25.704 --> 03:02:28.662
LIAM: Caleb and Nott got ten, ten.

03:02:28.662 --> 03:02:31.369
MATT: All right. Ten to five?

03:02:31.369 --> 03:02:32.806
LAURA: Six.

03:02:32.806 --> 03:02:35.762
MARK: Six. Six twins.

03:02:35.762 --> 03:02:38.920
MATT: Jester and Cali.

03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:40.756
ASHLEY: Wait, does Kiri get a turn?

03:02:40.756 --> 03:02:45.452
MATT: No, Kiri's staying in the back. All right,
that's everybody. Top of the round, as all three

03:02:45.452 --> 03:02:51.709
of them have spun around, apparently aware that
something is lurking in this area of it.

03:02:51.709 --> 03:02:54.560
SAM: It still doesn't see us, right?

03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:56.283
LIAM: For six seconds.

03:02:56.283 --> 03:03:05.364
MATT: No, but it's not an ambush round. So. Top of
the round is Beau, you're up.

03:03:05.364 --> 03:03:08.377
MARISHA: Can I hold my turn until Fjord goes?

03:03:08.377 --> 03:03:12.069
MATT: You can't hold your turn. You can hold an
action.

03:03:12.069 --> 03:03:18.146
TRAVIS: Do what you're going to do.

03:03:18.815 --> 03:03:21.306
MATT: All the bad stealth checks were--

03:03:21.306 --> 03:03:22.832
LIAM: Big three.

03:03:22.832 --> 03:03:25.063
ASHLEY: Big six.

03:03:25.063 --> 03:03:26.481
LAURA: I got ten.

03:03:26.481 --> 03:03:29.580
MATT: Ten, right. Okay, got it.

03:03:29.580 --> 03:03:30.639
ASHLEY: We die first.

03:03:30.639 --> 03:03:32.859
LIAM: Scheisse.

03:03:33.465 --> 03:03:37.904
MARISHA: Can I move into place and then hold my
action until Fjord goes?

03:03:37.904 --> 03:03:40.452
MATT: Depending on what your action trigger is,
yeah.

03:03:40.452 --> 03:03:46.921
MARISHA: I want to attack after he attacks, after
he casts a spell. Can I move in this corner

03:03:46.921 --> 03:03:48.261
as far as I can--

03:03:48.261 --> 03:03:49.754
MATT: Over here, next to Nott?

03:03:49.754 --> 03:03:52.786
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to stealth-- yeah.

03:03:52.786 --> 03:03:54.493
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

03:03:54.493 --> 03:03:56.027
MARISHA: Stealthing as fuck.

03:03:56.027 --> 03:03:57.936
MATT: Okay. And you're holding your action in case
Fjord attacks something.

03:03:57.936 --> 03:04:00.713
MARISHA: I'm going to hold my shurikens.

03:04:00.713 --> 03:04:03.312
MATT: Okay. So as you're pulling back with that,
Fjord?

03:04:03.312 --> 03:04:11.583
TRAVIS: I'm going to run around the corner. Give
me that right over here. Yeah, so I can see all

03:04:11.583 --> 03:04:13.183
three of them, at least.

03:04:13.183 --> 03:04:15.734
MATT: All right. Well, you're going to be out in
the open. Just so you're aware. All right. So you

03:04:15.734 --> 03:04:18.420
move over here. You can now see all three right
there.

03:04:18.420 --> 03:04:19.783
TRAVIS: 'Sup, fish-fucks!

03:04:19.783 --> 03:04:22.503
(laughter)

03:04:22.503 --> 03:04:26.367
MATT: Yeah, that's as far as you can move there.
They all turn, (growls). You see some of them

03:04:26.367 --> 03:04:31.722
holding what looks to be these large
harpoon-trident things that are hooked on the end

03:04:31.722 --> 03:04:38.288
and they have some sort of thick cabling of some
kind attached to the end of it.

03:04:38.781 --> 03:04:43.218
TRAVIS: Aren't y'all pretty? I look. In the space
in between them, I see this ripple start to form,

03:04:43.599 --> 03:04:49.997
and I reach out with my hand, and I'll grasp at
the space and tear a rip in reality, and I'll cast

03:04:49.997 --> 03:04:58.561
Hunger of Hadar, ripping this 20-foot dome on the
ground.

03:04:58.561 --> 03:05:04.718
MATT: 20-foot radius? Where do you want to place
it?

03:05:04.718 --> 03:05:10.130
TRAVIS: I'll put it right here, so it's--
Actually? No, I'll stick it right here. Yeah,

03:05:10.130 --> 03:05:15.419
because it halves it, makes it difficult terrain,
so let's put it right there. Ish.

03:05:15.419 --> 03:05:20.449
MATT: You got it. So you watch suddenly as the
back end of that chamber-- well, for those who can

03:05:20.449 --> 03:05:25.987
see, which Caleb currently-- it's mostly dark
except for that faint, faint glow around the

03:05:25.987 --> 03:05:30.582
corner that you don't see the source. There's no
light in here. That light goes out. You are blind

03:05:30.582 --> 03:05:33.670
at the moment, because what little bit of light
there is has been consumed by this sphere of

03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:41.051
darkness that Fjord has summoned on the opposite
side of the chamber. You watch as reality tears

03:05:41.051 --> 03:05:48.037
open in that space, and you see these strange,
black-purple otherworldly tentacles whip out from

03:05:48.037 --> 03:05:53.085
the outside of it, and you hear this horrible
slithering sound within the center of that

03:05:53.085 --> 03:05:56.267
chamber, with this faint underlying of whispers
and chanting.

03:05:56.267 --> 03:05:57.668
LAURA: Oh, shit.

03:05:57.668 --> 03:06:00.666
MATT: Does that do immediate damage, or only on
their turn?

03:06:00.666 --> 03:06:05.790
TRAVIS: Only if they start in it, or if they end
their turn in it. Two different types of damage.

03:06:05.790 --> 03:06:12.202
MATT: Cool, all right. So that ends your turn,
there. Molly, you're up.

03:06:12.202 --> 03:06:19.879
MARISHA: No, it's me. I get to go first. Can I pop
around the corner?

03:06:19.879 --> 03:06:25.666
MATT: Let me see here, real fast, about the Hunger
of Hadar spell.

03:06:25.666 --> 03:06:28.969
MARISHA: I have my goggles on, by the by.

03:06:30.628 --> 03:06:33.862
MATT: All right. So you cannot see anything. You
have your goggles on--

03:06:33.862 --> 03:06:36.373
MARISHA: --but I still can't see?

03:06:36.373 --> 03:06:39.341
TRAVIS: Well, actually, it says the void is filled
with a cacophony of soft whispers. No light,

03:06:39.341 --> 03:06:42.402
magical, or otherwise, can illuminate the area of
the 20-foot sphere--

03:06:42.402 --> 03:06:45.612
MATT: Correct. But you have Darkvision.

03:06:45.612 --> 03:06:48.626
TRAVIS: It's just within the sphere they're
blind.

03:06:48.626 --> 03:06:54.395
MATT: Correct. So I'll say you can see where they
are, but it's a little obscured, so.

03:06:54.395 --> 03:07:00.872
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to pop out. Can I pop
out? Am I able to do that?

03:07:00.872 --> 03:07:06.194
MATT: You are. Well no, I'm sorry, you cannot
move. You did your move, so you have to have an

03:07:06.194 --> 03:07:08.234
action, so you can only attack that one that you
can see there.

03:07:08.234 --> 03:07:10.072
MARISHA: Okay, I will throw two.

03:07:10.072 --> 03:07:13.860
MATT: Okay. They're at disadvantage, because it's
beyond your 20-foot initial range.

03:07:13.860 --> 03:07:19.582
MARISHA: First one? Man. I'll take that 12,
though, for an 18 to hit?

03:07:19.582 --> 03:07:22.742
MATT: That does hit, yeah.

03:07:22.742 --> 03:07:37.672
MARISHA: And that's-- sorry. Seven damage on that
one. And then second one... ooh, those are double

03:07:37.672 --> 03:07:40.326
fours, which I don't believe hit.

03:07:40.326 --> 03:07:42.017
MATT: Nope. Disappears into the darkness.

03:07:42.017 --> 03:07:48.323
MARISHA: And then I'm going to take a ki point and
cast-- I almost called it Uncanny Dodge.

03:07:48.323 --> 03:07:51.987
MATT: You had to do that on your turn. You've only
got an action you were holding. Sorry.

03:07:51.987 --> 03:07:54.387
MARISHA: Okay.

03:07:54.387 --> 03:07:57.072
LIAM: How high's the ceiling here?

03:07:57.072 --> 03:08:00.994
MATT: It's about ten, 11 feet. It's not very
high.

03:08:00.994 --> 03:08:07.048
MARISHA: I would have had to have said it earlier,
which I didn't know.

03:08:07.048 --> 03:08:10.253
MATT: All right, that ends Fjord and Beau's turn.
Molly?

03:08:10.253 --> 03:08:21.340
TALIESIN: Where am I? Let's see. I'm over there?
I'm going to run as far as I can go towards Fjord,

03:08:21.340 --> 03:08:26.562
and then I'm going to spend the rest of my action
running across and get into that little alcove.

03:08:26.562 --> 03:08:29.114
MATT: This one over here?

03:08:29.114 --> 03:08:33.113
TALIESIN: No, the other side of it, I'm so sorry.

03:08:33.113 --> 03:08:34.900
LAURA: No, like behind that little--

03:08:34.900 --> 03:08:37.058
MATT: Oh, I see. There we go.

03:08:37.058 --> 03:08:39.537
TALIESIN: So positioning and ready for things to
come.

03:08:39.537 --> 03:08:41.857
MATT: You still have a bonus, if you want to.

03:08:41.857 --> 03:08:43.559
TALIESIN: I've got nothing for my bonus.

03:08:43.559 --> 03:08:44.953
MATT: All right. Did you activate one of your
scimitars?

03:08:44.953 --> 03:08:46.664
TALIESIN: One is activated, the other is not.

03:08:46.664 --> 03:08:50.421
MATT: Got it, cool. That ends your turn? It is now
their turn. So, top of the round, they're both in

03:08:50.421 --> 03:08:52.195
the space, so they take how much damage?

03:08:52.195 --> 03:08:55.096
TRAVIS: They take 2d6--

03:08:55.096 --> 03:08:59.070
MATT: 2d6 cold damage.

03:08:59.070 --> 03:09:00.653
TRAVIS: Each of them. Do I roll that?

03:09:00.653 --> 03:09:03.213
MATT: You do. So roll all at once.

03:09:03.213 --> 03:09:12.495
TRAVIS: Five, four. Nine points of damage each.
Cold. (impacts) Tentacle beating!

03:09:12.495 --> 03:09:19.077
MATT: (laughs) You hear this strange slamming and
slithering sound and hissing noises on the inside.

03:09:19.077 --> 03:09:27.686
All righty, so this one's going to go ahead and
move just to the edge there.

03:09:27.686 --> 03:09:30.310
LAURA: He's dead, he's dead! Too late.

03:09:30.310 --> 03:09:33.138
LIAM: That's how it works.

03:09:33.138 --> 03:09:41.405
MATT: This guy gets to about there, actually,
before he can move into the water. Right now,

03:09:41.405 --> 03:09:44.377
because they don't have a huge movement on land.

03:09:44.377 --> 03:09:46.399
TRAVIS: And they're in difficult terrain, so it's
halved.

03:09:46.399 --> 03:09:48.807
MATT: Exactly. So those guys are clustered there.
That guy does manage to move--

03:09:48.807 --> 03:09:50.823
LAURA: Sweet, then they end their turn!

03:09:50.823 --> 03:09:56.578
TRAVIS: Yeah, you just send whatever you've got in
the sphere. Trying to keep them in one spot.

03:09:56.578 --> 03:10:02.805
MATT: He's going to continue slithering the rest
of the way. (counting)

03:10:02.805 --> 03:10:04.524
I'll say it gets him to about there.

03:10:04.524 --> 03:10:07.693
TRAVIS: At the end of their turns, they must
succeed on a dexterity saving throw--

03:10:07.693 --> 03:10:08.716
MATT: Well, it's not the end of their turn yet.

03:10:08.716 --> 03:10:10.365
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. My fault.

03:10:10.365 --> 03:10:15.131
MATT: The two, while still blinded, saw you
emerge. The one over on this end is going to go

03:10:15.131 --> 03:10:20.197
ahead and attempt to throw one of its harpoons in
your direction. It's blinded, so it has

03:10:20.197 --> 03:10:22.529
disadvantage on the attack.

03:10:22.529 --> 03:10:24.287
MARISHA: Do it!

03:10:26.115 --> 03:10:28.099
MATT: With disadvantage, that's a 16. What's your
armor class?

03:10:28.099 --> 03:10:29.288
TRAVIS: 17.

03:10:29.288 --> 03:10:35.200
MATT: Aw, slick! It shoots through and you deflect
it with the shield and watch it spark off. The one

03:10:35.200 --> 03:10:42.377
behind it is going to throw as well. Natural one,
yeah. It chucks the harpoon. Both of them land on

03:10:42.377 --> 03:10:48.012
the ground, and you hear them scrape as they're
pulled back to where they are. The one that is

03:10:48.012 --> 03:10:56.358
right there in front of you is going to throw
another harpoon. It's going to throw a harpoon at

03:10:56.358 --> 03:10:59.503
you. Still at disadvantage. That is a 20 to hit?

03:10:59.503 --> 03:11:01.201
TRAVIS: That hits.

03:11:01.201 --> 03:11:05.610
MATT: You suffer, as it jams and pierces into your
abdomen, right past the armor, sticking a couple

03:11:05.610 --> 03:11:14.691
inches into your chest. You take 11 points of
piercing damage and I need you to make a strength check.

03:11:14.691 --> 03:11:16.984
MARISHA: Don't get dragged!

03:11:16.984 --> 03:11:23.263
TRAVIS: I have to make a constitution saving throw
to keep the spell. Okay, strength save. Nine.

03:11:23.263 --> 03:11:32.329
MATT: Natural 20. You get dragged right up into
its space right there. Make a constitution saving

03:11:32.329 --> 03:11:34.560
throw to see if you can maintain concentration on
your spell.

03:11:34.560 --> 03:11:36.331
TRAVIS: What do I have to make? I forget.

03:11:36.331 --> 03:11:38.377
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

03:11:38.377 --> 03:11:40.057
MARISHA: You have to roll under the spell damage.

03:11:40.057 --> 03:11:41.786
TRAVIS: 23.

03:11:41.786 --> 03:11:44.850
MATT: So you succeed that one. Now it's pulled you
in. It's going to go ahead and make a bite attack

03:11:44.850 --> 03:11:50.292
against you, as it pulls you in. Its jaw opens up
to strike you. That is an 18 to hit.

03:11:50.292 --> 03:11:51.851
TRAVIS: That hits.

03:11:51.851 --> 03:11:59.919
MATT: Because you have 17 armor. You take seven
points of piercing damage as it digs its jaws

03:11:59.919 --> 03:12:04.761
right into the front of your chest and shoulder
area, biting down. Make another

03:12:04.761 --> 03:12:06.258
constitution saving throw.

03:12:06.258 --> 03:12:07.504
LAURA: Oh god!

03:12:07.504 --> 03:12:09.117
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:12:09.117 --> 03:12:13.629
MATT: You maintain concentration of the spell.
Now, all three of them have to make a dexterity

03:12:13.629 --> 03:12:25.139
saving throw or receive the damage again. That is
a fail, a fail, and a fail! Two, ten, and a three!

03:12:25.139 --> 03:12:30.266
TRAVIS: That is a six and a one, so seven points
of acid damage.

03:12:30.266 --> 03:12:40.580
MATT: Nice! That ends their turn. That brings us
to Yasha.

03:12:40.580 --> 03:12:46.851
ASHLEY: All right! How close can I get to this
guy?

03:12:46.851 --> 03:12:50.561
MATT: 40. You can't quite get up into his space.
You're ten feet away.

03:12:50.561 --> 03:12:53.194
ASHLEY: Shit.

03:12:53.194 --> 03:12:55.339
MATT: You can use an action to dash if you want to
make the rest of the movement, but you won't have

03:12:55.339 --> 03:12:57.446
an action on your turn.

03:12:57.446 --> 03:12:58.938
ASHLEY: I won't have an action.

03:12:58.938 --> 03:13:01.412
TALIESIN: Have anything good on a bonus?

03:13:01.412 --> 03:13:04.615
ASHLEY: I can do the rage, but then it can go
away.

03:13:04.615 --> 03:13:07.758
MATT: If you don't take damage by the end of your
next turn, then yeah.

03:13:07.758 --> 03:13:09.156
ASHLEY: Which is possible.

03:13:09.156 --> 03:13:10.988
MATT: Unless you move into the tentacle range.

03:13:10.988 --> 03:13:14.772
MARISHA: Tentacle range?

03:13:14.772 --> 03:13:16.242
LAURA: That's what his spell is.

03:13:16.242 --> 03:13:18.434
MARISHA: Oh boy. Oh you?

03:13:18.434 --> 03:13:24.006
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a sphere of darkness with stars
with milky tentacles whipping around.

03:13:24.006 --> 03:13:26.468
That's what it says.

03:13:26.468 --> 03:13:29.160
ASHLEY: Can I hold my action?

03:13:29.160 --> 03:13:33.115
MATT: You can. You're going to hold for what?

03:13:33.115 --> 03:13:44.669
ASHLEY: If he tries to fight or attack Fjord
again, I could-- that's not going to work. Oh god.

03:13:44.669 --> 03:13:46.876
LAURA: Just within range? Until he's in range?

03:13:46.876 --> 03:13:49.653
ASHLEY: Yeah. Until he gets in range.

03:13:49.653 --> 03:13:52.674
MATT: Okay. Holding your attack just in case it
comes in range. That ends your turn, Yasha. Nott

03:13:52.674 --> 03:13:56.557
and Caleb, you're up with Jester and Cali on
deck.

03:13:56.557 --> 03:14:04.651
LIAM: You want me to go? Yeah, sure. I'm going to
move forward until I can see-- no, Frumpkin's

03:14:04.651 --> 03:14:10.428
going to go first. I'm going to pull a Shakäste
and use Frumpkin to help me see in here.

03:14:10.428 --> 03:14:11.815
MATT: Okay.

03:14:13.281 --> 03:14:18.299
LIAM: I have to ask you, as a DM, can my cat see
in the dark?

03:14:18.299 --> 03:14:19.441
MATT: Does your cat have darkvision?

03:14:19.441 --> 03:14:20.883
LIAM: I don't know, it doesn't say.

03:14:20.883 --> 03:14:23.202
LAURA: No, remember? You looked at this before.

03:14:23.202 --> 03:14:26.092
LIAM: I don't remember, but I know that my cats
could see in the dark growing up.

03:14:26.092 --> 03:14:28.436
LAURA: But in the book it doesn't have darkvision.
We did this last--

03:14:28.436 --> 03:14:31.170
MATT: No, it does not.

03:14:31.170 --> 03:14:36.313
LIAM: I'm going to stumble forward in the dark.
I'm going to say: Beau!

03:14:36.313 --> 03:14:38.231
MARISHA: Huh?

03:14:38.231 --> 03:14:44.553
LIAM: I cast Enlarge on Beauregard so that she's
ten and a half feet tall.

03:14:44.553 --> 03:14:48.249
MARK: Has it been an hour by the way? My Light
spell still would be going so Caleb might be able

03:14:48.249 --> 03:14:50.442
to see the first area.

03:14:50.442 --> 03:14:54.092
MATT: The first area, but nothing beyond that
space.

03:14:54.092 --> 03:14:58.494
LIAM: If that's the case, then I wouldn't go that
far forward. I would stay as far away from danger

03:14:58.494 --> 03:15:03.178
as I can that as soon as I see Beauregard, cast
Enlarge.

03:15:03.178 --> 03:15:08.118
MATT: You got it. Beau has swollen to an enlarged
state.

03:15:08.118 --> 03:15:11.399
MARISHA: I'm so swole!

03:15:12.514 --> 03:15:15.560
LIAM: There's Amazon women singing right now.

03:15:15.560 --> 03:15:19.788
MATT: Beau takes up this entire space now.

03:15:19.788 --> 03:15:24.390
LAURA: Damn, Beau's big.

03:15:24.390 --> 03:15:30.523
MATT: At a ten-foot ceiling Beau, you suddenly
crouch. You're now hunched forward with the top of

03:15:30.523 --> 03:15:34.262
it grinding against the top of your head and
shoulders.

03:15:34.262 --> 03:15:38.266
LIAM: You got to pull a Vega position.

03:15:38.266 --> 03:15:46.146
SAM: I'll fire at the one near good old Fjord. Mr.
Fjord. Aw fuck. 12.

03:15:46.146 --> 03:15:47.751
TALIESIN: Does that get advantage?

03:15:47.751 --> 03:15:49.410
SAM: Why would I have advantage?

03:15:49.410 --> 03:15:51.664
TALIESIN: Aren't they in combo-- wouldn't that be
sneak attack?

03:15:51.664 --> 03:15:56.727
MATT: If he hits, it's sneak attack. He doesn't
get advantage, so it misses, unfortunately.

03:15:56.727 --> 03:16:01.820
SAM: I'll shoot again. Slightly better. 14?

03:16:01.820 --> 03:16:03.740
MATT: 14 does hit.

03:16:03.740 --> 03:16:04.770
SAM: Does this one get sneak attack?

03:16:04.770 --> 03:16:06.810
MATT: It does, yes.

03:16:08.921 --> 03:16:18.429
SAM: Terrible. Nine. 13 plus I'll take Fury of the
Small, so that's 18.

03:16:18.429 --> 03:16:24.405
MATT: 18 points of damage. All righty. That ends
your turn?

03:16:24.405 --> 03:16:27.823
SAM: Then, can I get all the way to Mollymauk on
my movement?

03:16:27.823 --> 03:16:30.156
MATT: Yeah, you can. Right over there.

03:16:30.156 --> 03:16:30.883
TALIESIN: Hi!

03:16:30.883 --> 03:16:34.718
SAM: Hi! Want some booze?

03:16:34.718 --> 03:16:36.815
TALIESIN: After!

03:16:36.815 --> 03:16:39.284
MATT: Jester and Cali.

03:16:39.284 --> 03:16:53.296
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to run over behind
Frumpkin, in that little alcove. Actually, that's

03:16:53.296 --> 03:16:56.370
a lie. I'm going to go next to Caleb.

03:16:56.370 --> 03:16:57.115
MATT: There?

03:16:57.115 --> 03:16:58.610
LAURA: Yeah, back a little bit.

03:16:58.610 --> 03:16:59.646
MATT: There you go.

03:16:59.646 --> 03:17:09.326
LAURA: Even more. Then I am going to cast Invoke
Duplicity. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity! She's

03:17:09.326 --> 03:17:15.099
going to run forward and stand next to Fjord!

03:17:15.099 --> 03:17:20.696
MATT: There you go. All righty. That's your turn,
Jester?

03:17:20.696 --> 03:17:24.315
LAURA: Yeah, because that's my action.

03:17:24.315 --> 03:17:27.937
MARK: How far can Cali get into, full movement,
close to--

03:17:27.937 --> 03:17:30.133
MATT: About 30, about there.

03:17:30.133 --> 03:17:35.924
MARK: About there. So I'll move there. You watch
as the draconic eye-- she brushes the hair out of

03:17:35.924 --> 03:17:43.490
the way. She focuses on the one fighting Fjord,
and a sickly green beam will shoot out of the eye,

03:17:43.490 --> 03:17:45.310
and I'm going to cast Ray of Sickness.

03:17:45.310 --> 03:17:47.116
MATT: All righty.

03:17:47.134 --> 03:17:51.988
MARK: This is an attack roll, a spell attack roll.
15?

03:17:51.988 --> 03:17:53.659
SAM: (singing) Sicker than a ray of light!

03:17:53.659 --> 03:17:54.514
MATT: 15 hits.

03:17:54.514 --> 03:18:00.387
MARISHA: Madonna, Ray of Light? Circa 2002? Jesus!

03:18:00.387 --> 03:18:03.782
MATT: Six?

03:18:03.782 --> 03:18:10.136
MARK: That's a failure, so it takes nine poison
damage and it's poisoned until the end of my turn.

03:18:10.136 --> 03:18:17.587
MATT: Great. It's poisoned until the end of your
next turn. As the bolt hits it, the veins all of a

03:18:17.587 --> 03:18:20.229
sudden go dark on its torso where it impacts.

03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:24.094
MARK: Then as she starts as the combat's going,
she's going to be like: Come on, let's kill these

03:18:24.094 --> 03:18:29.172
things. You start seeing a little bit of-- becomes
a bit more draconic.

03:18:29.172 --> 03:18:32.242
MATT: Ending Cali's turn. Beau, you're up.

03:18:32.242 --> 03:18:34.524
MARISHA: Oh wait, after Jester?

03:18:34.524 --> 03:18:36.523
MATT: Jester went. She Invoked Duplicity.

03:18:36.523 --> 03:18:39.120
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry. So me.

03:18:39.120 --> 03:18:42.762
MATT: Enlarged Beau is crouching down.

03:18:42.762 --> 03:18:47.111
MARISHA: Can I get to the doucher?

03:18:47.111 --> 03:18:48.892
MATT: You can.

03:18:48.892 --> 03:18:56.225
MARISHA: (deep voice) Sorry, my voice is even
deeper now! Sorry.

03:18:56.225 --> 03:19:01.435
MATT: This giant foot right next to you, Nott, as
Beau's large form almost stomps on you.

03:19:01.435 --> 03:19:11.023
MARISHA: 'Sup, Nott Bran? First attack. Okay. 16?

03:19:11.023 --> 03:19:12.829
MATT: 16, that hits.

03:19:12.829 --> 03:19:15.917
MARISHA: Second attack. Not good. 11?

03:19:15.917 --> 03:19:18.687
MATT: That misses.

03:19:18.687 --> 03:19:25.052
MARISHA: Okay. First attack. All right, ten
damage.

03:19:25.052 --> 03:19:30.207
MATT: Ten damage with your staff. As you rush up,
crouching low, you take the staff and jam it down

03:19:30.207 --> 03:19:35.087
into it. It looks back at you. It sees you looming
by. As it pulls up its harpoon to try and defend,

03:19:35.087 --> 03:19:41.395
you jam the staff into its chest, shove it to the
ground, under the water, and hear a crunch as you

03:19:41.395 --> 03:19:44.004
collapse its ribcage with the impact.

03:19:44.004 --> 03:19:47.796
MARISHA: Oh, is it dead?!

03:19:47.796 --> 03:19:49.879
MATT: It's taken the brunt of your damage.

03:19:49.879 --> 03:19:53.912
TRAVIS: What happens to the harpoon and the cord
sticking out of me?

03:19:53.912 --> 03:20:00.288
MATT: The harpoon fell out of the wound. It's
loose on the ground. There's a pretty nice

03:20:00.288 --> 03:20:03.213
puncture wound through your armor and your body
right there.

03:20:03.213 --> 03:20:05.280
TRAVIS: I appreciate it (pained sounds).

03:20:05.280 --> 03:20:11.491
MARISHA: You good? Okay. Good. Could I take the
staff, and I pick it up with the fish still on it,

03:20:11.491 --> 03:20:15.887
and I'm like: It's fish kebabs!

03:20:15.887 --> 03:20:18.479
SAM: That's not a thing.

03:20:18.479 --> 03:20:23.336
MARISHA: It is today. That's what's on the menu.

03:20:23.336 --> 03:20:28.687
SAM: This is Paul!

03:20:28.687 --> 03:20:33.764
LIAM: 20 feet behind, you hear: This is all I
wanted!

03:20:33.764 --> 03:20:46.407
MARISHA: Too many one-liners! Can I do something
creative and take my staff with my fish on it, and

03:20:46.407 --> 03:20:52.665
fling it, and try and throw the fish cadaver at
the other fish dudes?

03:20:52.665 --> 03:20:55.317
SAM: You're casting? With bait?

03:20:55.317 --> 03:21:00.197
MATT: You sure can. So you take it, and you fling
it into the darkness, and it (flopping).

03:21:00.197 --> 03:21:03.766
MARISHA: Oh come on, man. I can't try to aim to
attack--

03:21:03.766 --> 03:21:05.375
MATT: You've already used your action to do your
attack.

03:21:05.375 --> 03:21:06.539
MARISHA: But I have a bonus action!

03:21:06.539 --> 03:21:10.019
MATT: Bonus action's an unarmed strike, so this is
a flavor, as you throw it into the darkness that

03:21:10.019 --> 03:21:13.572
they can't see. You hear its body--

03:21:13.572 --> 03:21:16.543
MARISHA: You said I could use flavor for unarmed
shit.

03:21:16.543 --> 03:21:21.664
MATT: You were, but there was nothing to hit
that's unarmed in your face. You do fling it in

03:21:21.664 --> 03:21:23.985
there, and you hear this horrible slurping sound
as whatever--

03:21:24.275 --> 03:21:26.089
MARISHA: He told me to be flavorful!

03:21:26.089 --> 03:21:31.153
MATT: And you were. And whatever tear in reality
that was opened by Fjord's patron devours the

03:21:31.153 --> 03:21:36.453
corpse. It's plucked out of the air and sucked
through whatever small rip in reality had opened.

03:21:36.453 --> 03:21:39.948
LAURA: Still pretty cool, Beau, still pretty
cool.

03:21:39.948 --> 03:21:45.396
MARISHA: So can I take my actual bonus action to
do Patient Defense?

03:21:45.396 --> 03:21:51.053
MATT: Sure. All right, that ends your turn. Fjord,
you're up.

03:21:51.053 --> 03:22:08.313
TRAVIS: I'm going to hug this wall if I can, back
up a little bit, and I'm going to hold Eldritch

03:22:08.313 --> 03:22:11.761
Blast if I see them emerge from the darkness.

03:22:11.761 --> 03:22:13.916
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn.

03:22:13.916 --> 03:22:15.765
MARISHA: Did I have any more movement, by the by?

03:22:15.765 --> 03:22:16.657
MATT: You did have a little bit more, yeah.

03:22:16.657 --> 03:22:18.022
MARISHA: Could I have scooched up a bit?

03:22:18.022 --> 03:22:18.959
MATT: You could have, yeah.

03:22:18.959 --> 03:22:20.555
MARISHA: Just a scooch.

03:22:20.555 --> 03:22:22.551
TRAVIS: I'm scooching!

03:22:22.551 --> 03:22:25.700
MARISHA: Excuse me!

03:22:26.961 --> 03:22:28.889
MATT: You can scoot all the way up to here, if you
want.

03:22:28.889 --> 03:22:31.802
MARISHA: I've got very long legs right now.

03:22:31.802 --> 03:22:36.121
MATT: You're squat-moving your way through the
cavern.

03:22:36.121 --> 03:22:38.824
MARK: A core stance is very good for your abs.

03:22:38.824 --> 03:22:40.923
MATT: Molly, what do you got?

03:22:40.923 --> 03:22:43.474
TALIESIN: There ain't nothing for me to hit, so
I'm going to slightly peek out around the corner,

03:22:43.474 --> 03:22:51.381
so that I can keep an eye on things, and I'm going
to hold my attack for anything that comes within range.

03:22:51.432 --> 03:22:56.282
MATT: You got it. It's now their turn. Top of the
turn, they take 2d6 damage, so go ahead and roll that.

03:22:56.282 --> 03:23:02.673
TRAVIS: Two, three. Five points of cold damage.

03:23:02.673 --> 03:23:12.948
MATT: Got it. You hear (snarling) and (slurping)
sound on the inside of this darkened sphere. This

03:23:12.948 --> 03:23:19.823
guy manages to get into the water and poke his way
through, but just barely get his vision out. This

03:23:19.823 --> 03:23:29.212
guy's going to come out as well and encounter Beau
on that element. They're both still inside.

03:23:29.212 --> 03:23:30.743
LAURA: They're still inside the tentacles?

03:23:30.743 --> 03:23:33.933
TALIESIN: Yeah, the circle should be a little
further forward, so yeah they're just--

03:23:33.933 --> 03:23:38.371
MATT: They're still inside. And another one
arrives here, and can only move there.

03:23:38.371 --> 03:23:40.430
ASHLEY: We don't know that.

03:23:40.430 --> 03:23:42.680
TALIESIN: Since he's going to end his turn there.

03:23:42.680 --> 03:23:51.310
MATT: He will, yes. This one here is technically
right in range of Fjord, and is going to unleash

03:23:51.310 --> 03:23:59.323
two strikes on you. Its claws and its melee bite.
Actually, I could melee with a harpoon, so it's

03:23:59.323 --> 03:24:07.496
going to attempt to harpoon you and bite you.
Natural 20 on the harpoon, and then for the bite

03:24:07.496 --> 03:24:09.678
attack, that's going to be a 23.

03:24:09.678 --> 03:24:11.496
TRAVIS: Yeah, they both.

03:24:11.496 --> 03:24:19.351
MATT: The harpoon is going to be 24 points of
piercing damage as it jams right into your chest,

03:24:19.351 --> 03:24:24.844
pushing you against the wall. Go ahead and make a
concentration check, if you don't mind. You have

03:24:24.844 --> 03:24:26.142
to beat 12.

03:24:26.142 --> 03:24:29.007
TRAVIS: 21.

03:24:29.007 --> 03:24:35.412
MATT: It's going to attempt to bite you in the
face-- The bite, it actually hit. That's going to

03:24:35.412 --> 03:24:41.621
be a d8. That's eight points of piercing damage.

03:24:41.621 --> 03:24:43.812
LAURA: What are you at, Fjord?

03:24:43.812 --> 03:24:46.661
TRAVIS: I don't know, I can't add this fast, my
app's breaking.

03:24:46.661 --> 03:24:50.701
MATT: Where did my dice go? There it is. No, the
Snitch fell away, I need to keep it.

03:24:50.701 --> 03:24:54.463
LAURA: It touched the ground, that means it's
cursed now.

03:24:54.463 --> 03:24:56.580
MARISHA: It tried to run.

03:24:56.580 --> 03:24:58.051
MATT: It did.

03:24:58.051 --> 03:25:00.684
MARISHA: It did want to come home.

03:25:00.684 --> 03:25:02.995
MARK: Some treasures abandon their masters.

03:25:02.995 --> 03:25:07.402
(laughter)

03:25:07.402 --> 03:25:10.743
MATT: All righty, so make a second concentration
check.

03:25:10.743 --> 03:25:14.370
TRAVIS: 13.

03:25:14.370 --> 03:25:18.850
MATT: 13's fine, you maintain concentration. The
other one that's right next to Beau is going to

03:25:18.850 --> 03:25:24.658
attempt to also throw its harpoon at you, since it
saw that you were the source of this. They're

03:25:24.658 --> 03:25:26.092
trying to break the spell.

03:25:26.092 --> 03:25:31.690
TALIESIN: I'm going to go ahead and cast some
bullshit on that.

03:25:31.690 --> 03:25:33.716
MATT: You were holding an attack. You'll have to
say that—

03:25:33.716 --> 03:25:41.216
TALIESIN: This is a reaction. I'm doing a Blood
Maledict. The next two attacks are disadvantage.

03:25:41.216 --> 03:25:42.510
MATT: You're amplifying it?

03:25:42.510 --> 03:25:43.373
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:25:43.373 --> 03:25:45.403
MATT: Okay, go for it. So roll the damage, that's
disadvantage on that.

03:25:45.403 --> 03:25:46.541
TALIESIN: One point of damage.

03:25:46.541 --> 03:25:48.467
MATT: That's a 17 to hit. What's your armor
class?

03:25:48.467 --> 03:25:49.867
TRAVIS: 17.

03:25:49.867 --> 03:25:58.932
MATT: 17. It still hits the first strike. The
harpoon (crashing) into you. That's going to be 12

03:25:58.932 --> 03:26:00.320
points of piercing damage.

03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:07.705
TRAVIS: I go unconscious. I use my Relentless
Endurance to pop back up to one.

03:26:07.705 --> 03:26:14.102
MARISHA: Upon seeing Fjord get super daze-y, can I
use my Sentinel feat to crack this guy who just

03:26:14.102 --> 03:26:15.441
tried to attack?

03:26:15.441 --> 03:26:17.414
MATT: You can. While this is happening, roll a
concentration check.

03:26:17.414 --> 03:26:21.621
TRAVIS: 19 plus all that.

03:26:21.621 --> 03:26:23.622
MATT: And make a strength check for me, please.

03:26:23.622 --> 03:26:26.292
TRAVIS: I'm super strong. Where the fuck is it?

03:26:26.292 --> 03:26:28.829
MATT: 19 on its side.

03:26:28.829 --> 03:26:31.511
TRAVIS: 14.

03:26:31.511 --> 03:26:38.810
MATT: You get dragged 20 feet through the water
into range with it. Beau, you make your Sentinel

03:26:38.810 --> 03:26:39.957
Strike on it?

03:26:39.957 --> 03:26:42.818
MARISHA: Oh!

03:26:42.818 --> 03:26:46.429
MATT: Natural 20, nice. Go ahead and--

03:26:46.429 --> 03:26:58.612
MARISHA: That was awesome. Doubling the dice,
that's eight plus four, which is 12, plus another

03:26:58.612 --> 03:27:00.513
dice, that's two.

03:27:00.513 --> 03:27:03.132
MATT: The dice of the enlarged is also doubled,
too.

03:27:03.132 --> 03:27:09.060
MARISHA: That's right. That's two plus another
four. Sorry, that's two doubled which is four, so

03:27:09.060 --> 03:27:10.475
that's 16 damage.

03:27:10.475 --> 03:27:13.288
MATT: 16 points of damage. Crack!

03:27:13.288 --> 03:27:20.556
MARISHA: As he grabs the chain, big Beau steps on
the chain and cracks him right in the face.

03:27:20.556 --> 03:27:25.410
MATT: As it gets cracked, you watch as one of the
teeth goes flying from the impact of your giant

03:27:25.410 --> 03:27:31.472
elbow hammer into its jaw. Using that momentum, it
looks back, its eyes clenched down on Fjord,

03:27:31.472 --> 03:27:37.411
now almost prostrate before it, holding onto the harpoon, and
goes for the face. This is with disadvantage,

03:27:37.504 --> 03:27:47.982
though. That'll save you. It was a 17 and a two.
It goes to bite you, and you manage to pull up

03:27:47.982 --> 03:27:55.893
your sword in the way and block it. Its jaws open
and this terrible fishing breath smell cascades

03:27:55.893 --> 03:27:57.168
over your face.

03:27:57.168 --> 03:28:00.001
TRAVIS: It's like a dock on a Tuesday morning.

03:28:00.001 --> 03:28:04.043
MARISHA: What happens on Monday nights?

03:28:04.043 --> 03:28:06.369
MATT: The one on the other end is blind, it hears
all this noise happening, it's going to make a

03:28:06.369 --> 03:28:09.719
wide shot with its harpoon in the direction of
where it's hearing all this conflict.

03:28:09.719 --> 03:28:12.549
LAURA: Hit one of its brothers!

03:28:12.549 --> 03:28:18.892
MATT: Disadvantage. 16 and 18, that still hits.
Sorry, Fjord. You take--

03:28:18.892 --> 03:28:21.110
TRAVIS: At disadvantage? 16 doesn't hit.

03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:26.450
MATT: No, those are the dice rolls that I was
making. It was a 16 and a 19. So that's nine

03:28:26.450 --> 03:28:27.994
points of piercing damage.

03:28:27.994 --> 03:28:31.601
TRAVIS: He's throwing in the dark in the direction
where two guys, and he's threading them and

03:28:31.601 --> 03:28:32.900
hitting me?

03:28:32.900 --> 03:28:35.252
MATT: Yeah. You guys have done it before.

03:28:35.252 --> 03:28:38.062
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Unconscious I go.

03:28:38.062 --> 03:28:39.322
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:28:39.322 --> 03:28:48.227
MATT: And with that, Fjord goes down, and the
spell fades. It closes off. They now have visual.

03:28:48.227 --> 03:28:51.488
MARISHA: But that's all of their turns, right?

03:28:51.488 --> 03:28:52.876
MATT: This guy's going to move.

03:28:52.876 --> 03:28:54.458
MARISHA: Except for that motherfucker.

03:28:54.458 --> 03:29:00.033
TALIESIN: Wait, didn't he burn his whole turn just
getting to where he was?

03:29:00.033 --> 03:29:05.045
MATT: No, that was his movement. That's right, so
he wouldn't move. He went top of the round. Thank

03:29:05.045 --> 03:29:08.434
you for the reminder of that. But he used his
action to throw that. So that's all he has. That

03:29:08.434 --> 03:29:10.889
ends their go. Yasha, you're up.

03:29:10.889 --> 03:29:17.349
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to move to the guy who's
been attacking my boy, Fjord.

03:29:17.349 --> 03:29:20.704
MATT: This one here? All right. In the water or on
the side?

03:29:20.704 --> 03:29:21.809
ASHLEY: On the side.

03:29:21.809 --> 03:29:23.002
MATT: You got it.

03:29:23.002 --> 03:29:24.288
ASHLEY: I would like to rage.

03:29:24.288 --> 03:29:27.075
MATT: Going the full Yasha, angry.

03:29:27.075 --> 03:29:31.849
ASHLEY: Divine Fury, all the bits.

03:29:31.849 --> 03:29:33.451
MATT: Nott and Caleb, you're up next.

03:29:33.451 --> 03:29:41.343
ASHLEY: Reckless. Okay, that hits. 19.

03:29:41.343 --> 03:29:42.752
MATT: 19 hits.

03:29:42.752 --> 03:29:44.051
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:29:44.051 --> 03:29:52.959
MATT: So the first strike with the Divine, 3d6
plus seven.

03:29:52.959 --> 03:30:02.785
ASHLEY: Ooh. 20.

03:30:02.785 --> 03:30:08.962
MATT: 20 points of damage on the first strike as
you carve across its torso, it hisses back, still

03:30:08.962 --> 03:30:10.159
standing, though.

03:30:10.159 --> 03:30:11.153
ASHLEY: Another--

03:30:11.153 --> 03:30:14.104
MATT: That's 2d6 plus five.

03:30:14.104 --> 03:30:23.265
ASHLEY: All right, ten. 2d6 plus five?

03:30:23.265 --> 03:30:25.650
TALIESIN: What did you roll?

03:30:25.650 --> 03:30:27.820
ASHLEY: Wait, six plus what?

03:30:27.820 --> 03:30:29.126
MATT: Five.

03:30:29.126 --> 03:30:30.242
ASHLEY: 11.

03:30:30.242 --> 03:30:35.638
MATT: 11 points of damage? As the first blade
strike carves down its body, it pulls back

03:30:35.638 --> 03:30:40.251
hissing, Fjord's unconscious, sinking underwater
with the harpoon still sticking out of his chest,

03:30:40.251 --> 03:30:45.571
as it's leaning back at an angle as he vanishes
into the dark liquid. As it pulls back, it yanks

03:30:45.571 --> 03:30:50.126
the harpoon from his body, and you see his body
slightly lurch up out of the water before sinking

03:30:50.126 --> 03:30:53.575
again. It pulls it back to strike at you with it,
and when you pull the blade back, you thrust it

03:30:53.575 --> 03:30:58.609
right into its chest, and the light goes out of
its eyes.

03:30:58.609 --> 03:31:03.983
TALIESIN: Are you close enough to the bonus
action-- Can someone grab Fjord or is that not

03:31:03.983 --> 03:31:05.071
happening?

03:31:05.071 --> 03:31:07.538
ASHLEY: Can I as a bonus action--

03:31:07.538 --> 03:31:08.973
LIAM: That's an action.

03:31:08.973 --> 03:31:10.821
TRAVIS: Don't worry if I sink.

03:31:10.821 --> 03:31:13.425
LAURA: I'll be able to fix him in a second.

03:31:13.425 --> 03:31:14.897
TRAVIS: I have that armor.

03:31:14.897 --> 03:31:19.881
MATT: That's true, you have the armor on. He
starts to sink, and the body buoys itself back to

03:31:19.881 --> 03:31:21.168
the top.

03:31:21.168 --> 03:31:22.341
MARISHA: Is it like a life vest?

03:31:22.341 --> 03:31:23.967
TRAVIS: It's a life preserver, guys.

03:31:23.967 --> 03:31:28.302
MATT: It's the Mariner's armor that he had the
enchantment put over.

03:31:28.302 --> 03:31:29.914
LAURA: That's great.

03:31:29.914 --> 03:31:31.957
TRAVIS: Throw me a Bud Light.

03:31:31.957 --> 03:31:36.462
MATT: All righty, that ends Yasha's turn. Nott and
Caleb, you guys are up.

03:31:36.462 --> 03:31:43.993
LIAM: Caleb is going to walk behind Cali so he's
got a good view of merman over Fjord. I'm going to

03:31:43.993 --> 03:31:51.892
use the Glove of Blasting. First one is a natural
one, so that does not hit. The second one is a

03:31:51.892 --> 03:31:53.143
natural 20.

03:31:53.143 --> 03:31:54.447
MATT: Against which one?

03:31:54.447 --> 03:31:58.918
LIAM: Against the one right over Fjord. So that
is, Scheisse.

03:31:58.918 --> 03:32:05.392
SAM: Hey, Marisha.

03:32:05.392 --> 03:32:06.601
MARISHA: Yeah?

03:32:06.601 --> 03:32:08.023
SAM: Are you in melee with that thing?

03:32:08.023 --> 03:32:09.468
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:09.468 --> 03:32:10.781
SAM: Ah, okay.

03:32:10.781 --> 03:32:14.248
LIAM: 12 total, since it was a crit. Is it still
up?

03:32:14.248 --> 03:32:19.730
MATT: It is still up. As it bursts into it, the
flames burn across its system, but its body is

03:32:19.730 --> 03:32:24.204
damp and slick anyway, so you see the dark black
scorch marks, but nothing more than that.

03:32:24.204 --> 03:32:27.934
LIAM: And the third ray is not good, just a ten.

03:32:27.934 --> 03:32:32.962
MATT: Ten misses, unfortunately. Hits the ground
behind it, or hits the wall, burns across, and

03:32:32.962 --> 03:32:36.227
vanishes across the rock. That finishes your go.
Nott, you're up.

03:32:36.227 --> 03:32:40.480
SAM: I will lean out, and is someone engaged with
this one, where I would get sneak attack?

03:32:40.480 --> 03:32:41.420
MATT: Beau is.

03:32:41.420 --> 03:32:47.205
SAM: I will attack with a crossbow bolt. 24.

03:32:47.205 --> 03:32:48.409
MATT: That hits.

03:32:48.409 --> 03:32:52.263
SAM: Okay. Ooh, that's all terrible.

03:32:52.263 --> 03:32:53.896
LAURA: Well, not all terrible.

03:32:53.896 --> 03:32:56.415
SAM: 15.

03:32:56.415 --> 03:33:07.004
MATT: All righty. As you fire this one, it manages
to pierce right under its throat, and it turns

03:33:07.004 --> 03:33:14.255
back towards you and it grabs the harpoon off the
ground. As it pulls it back, the blood's gouting

03:33:14.255 --> 03:33:19.033
out of a major vein or artery in its throat. It
tries to get the strength, and as it does, it

03:33:19.033 --> 03:33:23.869
pulls back and gets woozy, throws it, and it lands
maybe two feet from where it grabs it, and with a

03:33:23.869 --> 03:33:28.343
horrible gurgle falls to the ground. It begins to
slip and sink into the water.

03:33:28.343 --> 03:33:39.665
SAM: Shit. Can I use my bonus action to fire the
other one? Why not?

03:33:39.665 --> 03:33:41.166
MATT: Disadvantage on this one, though.

03:33:41.166 --> 03:33:44.589
SAM: 15.

03:33:44.589 --> 03:33:45.980
MATT: 15 hits.

03:33:45.980 --> 03:33:48.900
SAM: That's six points of damage.

03:33:48.900 --> 03:33:54.174
MATT: Nice! That ends Nott's turn. Are you going
to move?

03:33:54.174 --> 03:33:58.856
SAM: No, I will stay there and huddle closer to
Mollymauk. Did you step out?

03:33:58.856 --> 03:33:59.950
TALIESIN: I did step out.

03:33:59.950 --> 03:34:02.561
SAM: No, I'm huddling away from Mollymauk.

03:34:02.561 --> 03:34:05.630
MATT: All right, Cali and Jester.

03:34:05.630 --> 03:34:14.996
LAURA: I'm going to send Duplicity me towards
Fjord, and she's in her illusion going to hug him

03:34:14.996 --> 03:34:22.069
and cast Cure Wounds. I will call from a distance
going, "Don't worry, Fjord, you'll be okay!" I'll

03:34:22.069 --> 03:34:25.674
cast it at level two.

03:34:25.674 --> 03:34:28.170
SAM: Aw, because Oskar?

03:34:28.170 --> 03:34:30.989
LAURA: So 11 points.

03:34:30.989 --> 03:34:37.676
MATT: You are conscious. (gasping) You look up and
see the faintly illusory image of Jester holding you.

03:34:37.676 --> 03:34:40.259
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester.

03:34:40.259 --> 03:34:42.609
MARISHA: And then big me over top of her.

03:34:42.609 --> 03:34:43.760
TRAVIS: Oh god!

03:34:43.760 --> 03:34:46.931
MARISHA: Hi, Fjord! Good to see you alive.

03:34:46.931 --> 03:34:48.539
TRAVIS: What's wrong with Beau?!

03:34:48.539 --> 03:34:56.197
LAURA: Then I'm going to use my bonus action to
cast Spiritual Weapon right over top of the other

03:34:56.197 --> 03:34:57.962
fish man in the back there.

03:34:57.962 --> 03:35:01.197
ASHLEY: (singing) Lollipop, lollipop.

03:35:01.197 --> 03:35:04.070
MATT and ASHLEY: (singing) Oh lolly, lolly, lolly,
lollipop.

03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:06.675
MATT: Pop! (singing) Roll that attack roll.

03:35:06.675 --> 03:35:12.761
LAURA: 14 plus something, so I think that hits.

03:35:12.761 --> 03:35:14.680
MATT: That hits. Its armor class is 13.

03:35:14.680 --> 03:35:22.057
LAURA: So that is 1d8 plus four. Force damage, so
eight force damage.

03:35:22.057 --> 03:35:26.330
MATT: All righty. That ends Jester's go. Cali.

03:35:26.330 --> 03:35:32.751
MARK: Cali is going to run up past Yasha and you
see she's like (growls) and shoves Yasha out of

03:35:32.751 --> 03:35:38.506
the way. I want to get as close as I possibly can.
Am I within 15 feet there?

03:35:38.506 --> 03:35:39.450
MATT: You are.

03:35:39.450 --> 03:35:45.414
MARK: Okay. She stops for a moment and you see
this green magic flow around. I'm going to cast

03:35:45.414 --> 03:35:54.397
Dragon's Breath at 3rd-level on myself. Then she
inhales. Acid breath, 15-foot cone over the creature.

03:35:54.397 --> 03:35:55.947
MATT: Yeah, 15-foot cone.

03:35:55.947 --> 03:35:58.208
MARISHA: I don't know what you just did, but I am
so into it.

03:35:58.208 --> 03:36:03.333
MATT: As the acid sprays out towards it, it covers
the area.

03:36:03.333 --> 03:36:04.839
MARK: Dex saving throw.

03:36:04.839 --> 03:36:08.087
MATT: Dex saving throw for the merrow as it tries
to avoid it. That is a natural three plus zero.

03:36:08.087 --> 03:36:09.554
That's a failure.

03:36:09.554 --> 03:36:15.731
MARK: So that's 4d6 damage. Oh, I was going to
reroll some of this, but I'm not now. So that's

03:36:15.731 --> 03:36:17.814
going to be 19 acid damage.

03:36:17.814 --> 03:36:24.131
MATT: Nice! As you finish spraying it down and all
the flesh on the outside of its body is beginning

03:36:24.131 --> 03:36:30.515
to melt away and burn and bubble, it (growls).
It's pretty scarred from that immediate spray

03:36:30.515 --> 03:36:32.165
across the front part of its torso.

03:36:32.165 --> 03:36:33.939
MARK: (deep voice) Come on! Come and get me!

03:36:33.939 --> 03:36:37.611
MATT: You see the eye gleaming still with the
Light spell. All right, that finishes your turn.

03:36:37.611 --> 03:36:39.660
Beau, top of the round, you.

03:36:39.660 --> 03:36:44.588
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to stride forward (large
footsteps).

03:36:44.588 --> 03:36:46.831
LIAM: Careful of your head.

03:36:46.831 --> 03:36:48.532
TRAVIS: (thuds) Ugh!

03:36:48.532 --> 03:36:57.167
MARISHA: Ah, fuck! This is what Travis deals with
all the time. Ow! Through Cali's acid mist, I'm

03:36:57.167 --> 03:37:02.429
going to split the air and cut down and do a big
slap right on its face.

03:37:02.429 --> 03:37:11.037
MATT: Okay. All right. As you go for the big
sweep, your staff goes (scraping) (thud).

03:37:11.037 --> 03:37:13.997
MARISHA: I get a little bit of--

03:37:13.997 --> 03:37:16.593
MATT: Bits of rock and shale is being ground and
falling all around you.

03:37:16.593 --> 03:37:20.555
MARISHA: It probably gets stuck a little bit, but
then it gives me a nice little snap.

03:37:20.555 --> 03:37:22.482
MATT: Exactly, a little snap at the end. Roll for
the attack.

03:37:22.482 --> 03:37:27.982
MARISHA: Okay, I'll take that. That's enough. 19.

03:37:27.982 --> 03:37:29.434
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

03:37:29.434 --> 03:37:31.546
MARISHA: 20. 19. I don't know. It's enough.

03:37:31.546 --> 03:37:33.574
LIAM: 19. Add that d4, motherfucker!

03:37:33.574 --> 03:37:36.967
MARISHA: Okay, that's nine plus--

03:37:36.967 --> 03:37:38.721
LIAM: Cocked.

03:37:38.721 --> 03:37:41.732
MARISHA: Ooh, 13.

03:37:41.732 --> 03:37:45.054
MATT: 13 points of damage. That's the first
strike.

03:37:45.054 --> 03:37:51.665
MARISHA: The second one, knowing I'm going to get
stuck on the ceiling, I'm going to paddle back and

03:37:51.665 --> 03:37:53.453
come up and crack with the other end.

03:37:53.453 --> 03:37:58.113
MATT: Okay. As you spin it this way, it wedges
itself from the floor to the ceiling and you have

03:37:58.113 --> 03:37:59.202
to like-- boom!

03:37:59.202 --> 03:38:00.437
MARISHA: Damn it!

03:38:00.437 --> 03:38:01.436
TRAVIS: Mike Myers.

03:38:01.436 --> 03:38:04.031
MARISHA: Okay. 15?

03:38:04.031 --> 03:38:06.104
MATT: 15 hits.

03:38:06.104 --> 03:38:14.406
MARISHA: Plus seven plus-- ten total.

03:38:14.406 --> 03:38:22.485
MATT: Ten points of damage. Whack! You crack into
it and it hits into its torso. It looks like it's

03:38:22.485 --> 03:38:27.806
bleeding out of its mouth onto its stomach. It
looks really painfully hurt and its eyes are

03:38:27.806 --> 03:38:31.424
dashing around each way. It looks like it's
starting to turn its head towards the area where

03:38:31.424 --> 03:38:32.402
it emerged.

03:38:32.402 --> 03:38:34.073
MARISHA: I'm going to do flurry of blows.

03:38:34.073 --> 03:38:35.712
MATT: Okay, using a ki point.

03:38:35.712 --> 03:38:36.853
MARISHA: Flurry of Beaus.

03:38:36.853 --> 03:38:37.981
ASHLEY: Flurry of blows.

03:38:37.981 --> 03:38:39.162
TRAVIS: Flurry of Beaus.

03:38:39.162 --> 03:38:40.781
MARISHA: That's not great. 12.

03:38:40.781 --> 03:38:41.955
MATT: 12 misses.

03:38:41.955 --> 03:38:46.256
MARISHA: Second one is even fucking worse. It's a
two.

03:38:46.256 --> 03:38:51.463
MATT: This time, as you try to punch, it manages
to dodge the first one, and the second time you go

03:38:51.463 --> 03:38:55.795
to swing, one of the pieces of stone that had
dislodged slightly from when you had impacted it

03:38:55.795 --> 03:39:01.164
falls and catches your fist in the middle of the
air. It shatters and causes this cloud of dust to

03:39:01.164 --> 03:39:04.739
cross the creature but your hand fucking hurts!

03:39:04.739 --> 03:39:07.319
LIAM: Haha, good show!

03:39:07.319 --> 03:39:09.544
LAURA: Do you get one more hit?

03:39:09.544 --> 03:39:12.714
MATT: That's it. End of Beau's turn. Fjord, you're
up.

03:39:12.714 --> 03:39:15.078
TRAVIS: I'll use half my speed to stand upright.

03:39:15.078 --> 03:39:17.139
MATT: Back to there, yeah.

03:39:17.139 --> 03:39:20.426
TRAVIS: And I'll unleash two Eldritch Blasts at
that--

03:39:20.426 --> 03:39:22.105
MATT: Go for it.

03:39:22.105 --> 03:39:24.117
TRAVIS: That's a 26.

03:39:24.117 --> 03:39:25.232
MATT: That hits.

03:39:25.232 --> 03:39:30.915
TRAVIS: And that's cocked. Reach for the sky! And
an 18.

03:39:30.915 --> 03:39:33.438
MATT: Yeah, roll damage.

03:39:33.438 --> 03:39:41.584
TRAVIS: Six points of damage on the first one, and
14 points of damage on the second one.

03:39:41.584 --> 03:39:46.626
MATT: How do you want to do this? It's turning
around and slithering away. It's about to dive

03:39:46.626 --> 03:39:51.089
back into the water and probably disappear into a
subterranean tunnel that's filled.

03:39:51.089 --> 03:39:57.808
TRAVIS: I stand up. I get to my feet. I touch the
wound area and I fire it across the way.

03:39:57.808 --> 03:40:03.058
MATT: As you release your hand, both bolts arc
outward and slam into it from the back. From the

03:40:03.058 --> 03:40:06.625
front perspective, it would look like Guyver, how
he tears the chest and the beams come out, but

03:40:06.625 --> 03:40:12.342
instead it's its internal organs being shoved out
into the wall and there's two open holes,

03:40:12.342 --> 03:40:19.368
Tombstone-style, before it hits the water and
slithers and sinks down into the small tunnel.

03:40:19.368 --> 03:40:25.128
LIAM: (twangy singing) I got friends in eldritch
places.

03:40:25.128 --> 03:40:28.738
LAURA: Wait, did you say it fell into the hole?

03:40:28.738 --> 03:40:32.173
MATT: The impact hit it and began (sucking).

03:40:32.173 --> 03:40:33.887
LAURA: Don't let it go into the hole!

03:40:33.887 --> 03:40:36.835
MARK: We're out of initiative? Or are we--

03:40:36.835 --> 03:40:38.174
MATT: We're out of initiative at this point.

03:40:38.174 --> 03:40:42.842
MARK: Okay. I run up and with the clawed hand, she
dives into try and grab this thing out of the pool.

03:40:42.842 --> 03:40:47.171
MATT: Sure. Make a dexterity saving throw to see
if you can react quick enough.

03:40:47.171 --> 03:40:49.604
MARISHA: Can I assist for advantage?

03:40:49.604 --> 03:40:57.070
MATT: Sure. It's less of a skill check. It's more
of a reactionary thing, so you wouldn't be able to

03:40:57.070 --> 03:40:58.589
help with it.

03:40:58.589 --> 03:40:59.711
MARK: Five.

03:40:59.711 --> 03:41:02.610
MATT: Five? Okay, you're trying to reach it, but
it sunk too low.

03:41:02.610 --> 03:41:05.163
MARISHA: I'm going to take my staff and try the
same thing.

03:41:05.163 --> 03:41:09.802
MATT: You're hitting stone and then nothing, just
water below.

03:41:09.802 --> 03:41:14.835
MARK: So when Beau's doing that, she turns around
and snaps at Beau. (rough voice) Get away from my

03:41:14.835 --> 03:41:20.304
stuff! That's my kill! (normal voice) Sorry. I
didn't mean to yell. Sorry about that.

03:41:20.304 --> 03:41:21.694
TALIESIN: Hey, we're all friends here.

03:41:21.694 --> 03:41:22.689
MARK: Yeah, I know. We are.

03:41:22.689 --> 03:41:24.168
TALIESIN: I cast Friends.

03:41:24.168 --> 03:41:29.553
MARK: Yeah, of course we are. Sorry. Sometimes, I
just get really aggressive sometimes. I'm sorry.

03:41:29.553 --> 03:41:33.815
TALIESIN: I know. That was intense. There's a lot
in that. Are you going to be all right?

03:41:33.815 --> 03:41:39.383
MARK: Yeah, I just get really possessive about
certain things sometimes. Dragon blood and all.

03:41:39.383 --> 03:41:42.099
Thank you for looking out for me.

03:41:42.099 --> 03:41:45.608
TALIESIN: You're right. You're going to feel a
little weird in a few minutes. I apologize for

03:41:45.608 --> 03:41:52.335
that. It's a thing. Let's clear this water and
let's take a breather. Let's sit down.

03:41:52.335 --> 03:41:55.716
LAURA: Let's get this guy out of the tunnel in
case somebody comes through the tunnel. I don't

03:41:55.716 --> 03:41:57.661
want anyone to see him right away.

03:41:57.661 --> 03:42:00.156
MATT: Do you clear the water?

03:42:00.156 --> 03:42:01.096
MARK: Yeah.

03:42:01.096 --> 03:42:08.545
MATT: You do and you see that the tunnel curves
below and evens out. It sunk, hit the bottom

03:42:08.545 --> 03:42:13.553
sediment, and dragged a little bit and came to
rest about maybe 15 feet below the surface. You

03:42:13.553 --> 03:42:17.763
take a moment to dive under, grab it, and whether
through a chain of hands or whatever, because it's

03:42:17.763 --> 03:42:23.283
pretty heavy. It's a large body, probably weighs
close to 800 pounds. So you guys have to all

03:42:23.283 --> 03:42:29.634
together pull it up, and it takes a few moments to
do so. But Jester's pretty beefy.

03:42:29.634 --> 03:42:33.121
LAURA: Me and Yasha basically got it out.

03:42:33.121 --> 03:42:36.432
MATT: Between the two of you, you eventually get
it up back into the chamber.

03:42:36.432 --> 03:42:43.910
LIAM: Roughly a minute later, I say: So you have
been somewhat charmed by a circus carnie. It's

03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:45.391
going to be okay.

03:42:45.391 --> 03:42:48.771
MATT: At which point the Friends spell ends, and
you can feel an influence that was previously

03:42:48.771 --> 03:42:50.710
there over your personality.

03:42:50.710 --> 03:42:54.721
LIAM: You seemed a little angry. He didn't mean
anything by it.

03:42:54.721 --> 03:42:58.225
MARK: It's fine. It's fine. (deep breath)

03:42:58.225 --> 03:43:01.012
LIAM: Just trying to keep everything copacetic and
in order.

03:43:01.012 --> 03:43:07.047
MARK: I know. Thank you, Mr. Caleb. Thank you. No,
it's fine. I do understand why. It's fine. Thank you.

03:43:07.047 --> 03:43:09.352
TALIESIN: Thought you needed a minute of clarity.

03:43:09.352 --> 03:43:15.314
MARK: It's fine. People normally react really
worse when I go like that, so it's fine. You guys

03:43:15.314 --> 03:43:20.049
didn't beat me up. You didn't try and kill me.
It's great. You guys are nice. Thank you.

03:43:20.049 --> 03:43:25.917
LIAM: I mean, you have a lot of scales on your
face, but look at this one. Look at this one. Look

03:43:25.917 --> 03:43:27.372
at this one.

03:43:27.372 --> 03:43:28.770
TALIESIN: This one less so.

03:43:28.770 --> 03:43:31.157
TRAVIS: We can deal with tempers.

03:43:31.157 --> 03:43:33.632
LIAM: That one as well.

03:43:33.632 --> 03:43:37.173
MARK: You all look fantastic. She's so cute as
well. You're really lucky.

03:43:37.173 --> 03:43:38.927
LAURA and SAM: Kiri?

03:43:38.927 --> 03:43:41.334
MARISHA: Is she all right?

03:43:41.334 --> 03:43:44.990
TALIESIN: I am keeping an eye on these pools,
looking for any movement, by the way.

03:43:44.990 --> 03:43:49.532
MATT: Kiri comes around the corner with the
dagger, sees you all standing there (chirping).

03:43:49.532 --> 03:43:51.158
LAURA: You did it. You killed them.

03:43:51.158 --> 03:43:55.369
MATT: Runs up to the body there and goes (dagger
slice). (like Cali) "I killed people!"

03:43:55.369 --> 03:44:01.074
MARK: It's like Chappie. Chappie be good.

03:44:01.074 --> 03:44:03.592
MATT: Stabs the body a few more times.

03:44:03.592 --> 03:44:05.552
SAM: That's enough.

03:44:05.552 --> 03:44:07.342
TRAVIS: Somebody help me check these crates.

03:44:07.342 --> 03:44:09.607
MARK: Yeah, I'm going to start looking through as
well.

03:44:09.607 --> 03:44:13.779
MATT: Okay, who's helming the investigation? Okay,
an individual has to helm it.

03:44:13.779 --> 03:44:15.046
LIAM: I'm going to investigate.

03:44:15.046 --> 03:44:18.441
MATT: All right. Caleb, you're being aided, so make it
with advantage.

03:44:18.441 --> 03:44:21.196
LIAM: Yeah, I've got a high stat in it.

03:44:21.196 --> 03:44:24.049
MARISHA: Hey, Cali.

03:44:24.049 --> 03:44:25.132
LIAM: Cocked.

03:44:25.132 --> 03:44:26.276
MARK: Yes, Ms. Beau?

03:44:26.276 --> 03:44:27.614
MATT: That wasn't cocked, technically.

03:44:27.614 --> 03:44:30.521
LIAM: Well it was on a magnet, so it was stuck to
a magnet.

03:44:30.521 --> 03:44:32.959
MATT: Oh, did it? Okay. Metal dice.

03:44:32.959 --> 03:44:37.442
LIAM: At advantage? We'll call the first one,
which was a three on a magnet, and the second roll

03:44:37.442 --> 03:44:42.440
was a 17 plus my eight is a 25.

03:44:42.440 --> 03:44:43.764
MATT: Okay.

03:44:43.764 --> 03:44:47.229
LAURA: It's a light die. It's not like a heavy one
that wouldn't be affected by the magnet.

03:44:47.229 --> 03:44:50.705
MARISHA: Oh, it does magnet. It does actually
magnet.

03:44:50.705 --> 03:44:53.696
LIAM: I can do this for the future.

03:44:53.696 --> 03:44:55.360
TALIESIN: Have you not played with your Gil die
yet?

03:44:55.360 --> 03:44:56.691
ASHLEY: Yeah, it totally sticks to it.

03:44:56.691 --> 03:44:58.038
LIAM: So 25.

03:44:58.038 --> 03:45:04.304
MATT: As you guys are rummaging through with Caleb
helming this section, you're going through a bunch

03:45:04.304 --> 03:45:09.985
of empty crates, partially destroyed crates.
Pushing aside the mostly torn apart corpse of this

03:45:09.985 --> 03:45:17.151
crocodile and ignoring that. You manage to find a
number of gold and silver pieces that have been

03:45:17.151 --> 03:45:23.248
scattered and lost and fallen into the sand.
Digging through the natural gravel and sand floor

03:45:23.248 --> 03:45:27.308
of this chamber, you find that a lot of it has
just been buried. They weren't interested in gold

03:45:27.308 --> 03:45:31.163
pieces. They weren't interested in money. A lot of
that was left behind and scattered and has

03:45:31.163 --> 03:45:36.954
been covered. You take a moment to pull through
and you manage to acquire 185 gold, 210 silver

03:45:36.954 --> 03:45:39.914
pieces, and 65 copper pieces.

03:45:39.914 --> 03:45:41.882
LAURA: 210 silver, you said?

03:45:41.882 --> 03:45:42.840
MATT: Correct.

03:45:42.840 --> 03:45:44.752
LIAM: Distribute that equally, however you would
do that.

03:45:44.752 --> 03:45:47.954
LAURA: Okay. We'll do some math.

03:45:47.954 --> 03:45:53.226
MATT: You find a bunch of jewelry, necklaces, and
rings that are thrown about and lost.

03:45:53.226 --> 03:45:56.073
LAURA: Do you see any diamonds? Do you see 300
gold worth of diamonds?

03:45:56.073 --> 03:45:58.284
LIAM: I put a bunch of jewelry into Jester's
hands.

03:45:58.284 --> 03:46:03.672
MATT: Okay. All the jewelry together would come to
about, just for purposes of resale, 250 gold worth

03:46:03.672 --> 03:46:11.420
of jewelry. There are no diamonds in there worth
300 gold, sorry. There are four sets of manacles.

03:46:11.420 --> 03:46:15.353
ALL: Manacles?

03:46:15.353 --> 03:46:21.375
MARISHA: People are going to suspect things of us.
Trading in manacles all the time. These didn't work!

03:46:21.375 --> 03:46:26.664
TALIESIN: The official currency of it. Nice
manacles.

03:46:26.664 --> 03:46:29.545
MATT: The manacles are empty, though they are
bloody.

03:46:29.545 --> 03:46:30.982
LAURA: You said four sets of manacles?

03:46:30.982 --> 03:46:32.758
MATT: Yes, four sets of bloody manacles.

03:46:32.758 --> 03:46:37.547
TRAVIS: Do they have any rune-ish markings on them
or anything like that?

03:46:37.547 --> 03:46:39.333
MATT: No, these do not. These are plain manacles.

03:46:39.333 --> 03:46:41.063
TALIESIN: Are they humanoid sized?

03:46:41.063 --> 03:46:49.513
MATT: Roughly, yeah. There are a number of broken
vials of some thick purple liquid, but two of them

03:46:49.513 --> 03:46:55.084
are not broken. You rolled really high on your
investigation. So two vials of a thick purple

03:46:55.084 --> 03:46:59.892
liquid, roughly about that big. It's a thick, oily
substance.

03:46:59.892 --> 03:47:02.913
LIAM: I'd like to take these for a moment. Or
maybe ten moments.

03:47:02.913 --> 03:47:08.613
MATT: Nott, you see one thing, helping Caleb out,
and you pull it out. It looks to be a well-crafted

03:47:08.613 --> 03:47:16.857
marble bowl of gold inlay of a curious design. The
edges of the bowl shift into five multiple dragon

03:47:16.857 --> 03:47:24.913
heads, equally separated and in each dragon, the
eyes are tiny gemstones. One set's rubies, one

03:47:24.913 --> 03:47:27.464
set's emeralds, one set's sapphires, one set's
diamond.

03:47:27.464 --> 03:47:29.833
SAM: I will try to conceal this from Cali.

03:47:29.901 --> 03:47:34.159
MATT: All righty, make a sleight of hand check.
Cali, make a perception check.

03:47:34.159 --> 03:47:37.642
SAM: I will use my luck point.

03:47:37.642 --> 03:47:39.902
(gasping)

03:47:39.902 --> 03:47:41.271
MARISHA: You have luck? Oh, it was the--

03:47:41.271 --> 03:47:44.700
SAM: 28.

03:47:44.700 --> 03:47:46.504
MARK: Eight.

03:47:46.504 --> 03:47:48.612
(laughter)

03:47:48.612 --> 03:47:50.443
TRAVIS: We treat guests so well!

03:47:50.443 --> 03:47:53.549
MARK: That's what Nott would do. Absolutely what
Nott would do.

03:47:53.549 --> 03:47:57.682
MARISHA: You're so mean.

03:47:57.682 --> 03:47:59.680
MARK: She's just looking through the crates.

03:47:59.680 --> 03:48:01.393
MATT: Looking through frantically, you don't see
anything there.

03:48:01.393 --> 03:48:03.037
MARK: I'm sure it was here.

03:48:03.037 --> 03:48:06.803
LAURA: Really, people don't like it when you do
these things, Sam.

03:48:06.803 --> 03:48:09.104
SAM: I just have to confer with Caleb.

03:48:09.104 --> 03:48:12.986
MARISHA: So, Cali. I started a conversation
earlier.

03:48:12.986 --> 03:48:14.926
MARK: Hey, Ms. Beau.

03:48:14.926 --> 03:48:23.687
MARISHA: Which might be why you got so distracted.
You seem to have such an affinity for cute things.

03:48:23.687 --> 03:48:29.593
Is there a reason why you like cute things? I'm
not saying that not all of us like cute things. We

03:48:29.593 --> 03:48:33.590
all love cute things, but you seem to really like
cute things.

03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:37.537
MARK: I guess it's just one of those things
where-- and she's doing this as she's going

03:48:37.537 --> 03:48:44.426
through the crates-- I was a kid and I used to ask
for dolls and pets and stuff when I was growing up

03:48:44.426 --> 03:48:48.973
and the cult used to give them to me. Serissa used
to give them to me. I don't know. There's a lot of

03:48:48.973 --> 03:48:55.445
bad stuff in the world and it's nice to appreciate
nice things sometimes. I like having and finding

03:48:55.445 --> 03:48:57.965
cute stuff. Do you not like that?

03:48:57.965 --> 03:49:04.840
MARISHA: I just might appreciate some other
things.

03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:06.437
MARK: Your outfit's cute though.

03:49:06.437 --> 03:49:08.144
MARISHA: Man, thank you.

03:49:08.144 --> 03:49:15.978
MARK: That's all right. You're welcome. I was sure
it was here. I traced it. I followed them. I knew

03:49:15.978 --> 03:49:22.799
that it was coming through this-- Maybe I missed
it. Maybe I've messed up.

03:49:22.799 --> 03:49:25.497
TALIESIN: How deep is that pool?

03:49:25.497 --> 03:49:30.737
MATT: It gets about five or six feet deep.

03:49:30.737 --> 03:49:32.435
TALIESIN: I'm going to search the bottom of it.

03:49:32.435 --> 03:49:34.176
MATT: Make an investigation check with
disadvantage.

03:49:34.176 --> 03:49:39.905
TRAVIS: Are there any weapons that the merrow
dropped? The hook or the spears? Or were they

03:49:39.905 --> 03:49:41.337
tridents or anything?

03:49:41.337 --> 03:49:46.901
MATT: There's one of them that was a three-pronged
trident and two that were just long harpoons.

03:49:46.901 --> 03:49:51.923
They're all hooked at the tips and they had this
thick rope cable on the edge that they were using

03:49:51.923 --> 03:49:53.189
to pull them back in.

03:49:53.189 --> 03:49:55.739
TRAVIS: I pick up one of the tridents. Does it
seem like an average--

03:49:55.739 --> 03:49:57.219
MATT: Just a trident.

03:49:57.219 --> 03:50:04.235
LIAM: I would propose-- I just rolled a 17 on
perception to see if Caleb noticed Nott even do that.

03:50:04.235 --> 03:50:05.875
SAM: I'm going to come tell you anyways.

03:50:05.875 --> 03:50:10.602
LIAM: Well, but you rolled a 28, so it would be
super hard for anyone at the table to have seen it.

03:50:10.602 --> 03:50:12.662
MATT: Yeah, no one noticed. Nobody noticed.

03:50:12.662 --> 03:50:15.303
ASHLEY: I'm still keeping watch. I'm watching the
hole.

03:50:15.303 --> 03:50:17.274
LAURA: I wanted to look in the pools too.

03:50:17.274 --> 03:50:19.357
TALIESIN: Can she give me advantage on that?

03:50:19.357 --> 03:50:22.857
MATT: Sure. Usually you got to tell me before you
roll.

03:50:22.857 --> 03:50:24.734
TALIESIN: I know. We didn't want to interrupt the
thing.

03:50:24.734 --> 03:50:25.930
MATT: That's fine.

03:50:25.930 --> 03:50:28.188
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter anyway, it's eight.

03:50:28.188 --> 03:50:34.164
MATT: It's brackish and thick and you don't find
much of interest.

03:50:34.164 --> 03:50:37.368
TALIESIN: Check that other one too in a moment.

03:50:37.368 --> 03:50:39.733
MATT: You do find some bones.

03:50:39.733 --> 03:50:41.666
MARK: I can clear the water as well.

03:50:41.666 --> 03:50:51.037
MATT: Looking through, you find a number of
discarded humanoid skeletons. Four of them, to be

03:50:51.037 --> 03:50:52.143
exact.

03:50:52.143 --> 03:50:53.374
TALIESIN: The other one, then.

03:50:53.374 --> 03:50:58.503
MARISHA: Maybe it's in the next room. There's still
another room.

03:50:58.503 --> 03:51:00.179
SAM: There is?

03:51:00.179 --> 03:51:03.820
LAURA: They were coming from somewhere. Who knows,
there could be 20 of them on the other side of this.

03:51:03.820 --> 03:51:06.521
MARISHA: It's true. Could be a whole network of
caverns.

03:51:06.521 --> 03:51:07.735
SAM: Should we fill in the hole?

03:51:07.735 --> 03:51:08.974
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have to.

03:51:08.974 --> 03:51:10.537
MARISHA: Until we find--

03:51:10.537 --> 03:51:13.829
SAM: Ooh! We have thunder sticks!

03:51:13.829 --> 03:51:17.186
MARISHA: We do have boom boom sticks.

03:51:17.186 --> 03:51:19.974
LIAM: Is this the end of our task here?

03:51:19.974 --> 03:51:21.091
MATT: Fjord.

03:51:21.091 --> 03:51:22.286
LAURA: We're supposed to secure the safehouse.

03:51:22.286 --> 03:51:30.280
MATT: As they're having this conversation, you
feel this strange crawling sensation in the back

03:51:30.280 --> 03:51:35.345
of your head as you're looking past this pool down
into the darkness below. Even though it's clear,

03:51:35.345 --> 03:51:41.349
you can see the ripples, and there's something
gently tugging you in that direction, and a

03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:49.249
familiar voice creeps in, sourceless, within your
brain, that says, "Learn."

03:51:54.257 --> 03:51:55.827
LAURA: So anyway.

03:51:55.827 --> 03:51:57.728
SAM: We just killed Fjord's family.

03:51:57.728 --> 03:52:05.425
LAURA: I feel like we should check and see if
there's 20 of them on the other side of this thing.

03:52:05.425 --> 03:52:10.088
MARISHA: Or like you said, we just destroy the
entrance to where they can't come through.

03:52:10.088 --> 03:52:13.172
TALIESIN: Don't we have a cat that can become a
fish?

03:52:13.172 --> 03:52:15.957
MARISHA: It takes time, and equipment.

03:52:15.957 --> 03:52:20.182
TRAVIS: Plus, some of us can swim. We could pop
down real quick and see what's down there.

03:52:20.182 --> 03:52:24.379
LIAM: I'm taking those two purple vials and
walking around the corner over this way to set

03:52:24.379 --> 03:52:28.512
them down and start doing my thing, and I'm going
to start pulling out my book.

03:52:28.512 --> 03:52:30.681
SAM: I will join him.

03:52:30.681 --> 03:52:34.228
TRAVIS: Anyone else feel like going for a swim?

03:52:34.228 --> 03:52:35.883
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yes.

03:52:35.883 --> 03:52:37.426
MARISHA: I could probably join you for a swim.

03:52:37.426 --> 03:52:41.449
MARK: I need to check and make sure it's not here,
and if there is a room back there I need to make

03:52:41.449 --> 03:52:42.654
sure it's not here.

03:52:42.654 --> 03:52:45.143
TALIESIN: We don't know if there's going to be air
on the other side of that, though, so we need

03:52:45.143 --> 03:52:46.301
people that can--

03:52:46.301 --> 03:52:51.842
LAURA: Yeah, one person that can breathe really
well. Fjord, you are familiar with the sea. Can

03:52:51.842 --> 03:52:53.454
you hold your breath for a long time?

03:52:53.454 --> 03:52:55.138
TRAVIS: Yeah, pretty decent.

03:52:55.138 --> 03:52:57.038
LAURA: All right. How about you go--

03:52:57.038 --> 03:52:58.109
SAM: Like, forever?

03:52:58.109 --> 03:52:59.592
TRAVIS: No.

03:52:59.592 --> 03:53:01.572
TALIESIN: As long as you don't mind dying, sure.

03:53:01.572 --> 03:53:03.170
SAM: Do you have gills?

03:53:03.170 --> 03:53:05.914
ASHLEY: What if we tie a rope to you?

03:53:05.914 --> 03:53:08.738
TRAVIS: Sure, we have an extra 50 feet, we didn't
really need the rest.

03:53:08.738 --> 03:53:11.557
LAURA: Should we take a short rest again? Oh, it's
another hour.

03:53:11.557 --> 03:53:13.702
TALIESIN: We're going to do this.

03:53:13.702 --> 03:53:15.729
LAURA: Oh, you can only do it once a day.

03:53:15.729 --> 03:53:16.928
MATT: What, the--

03:53:16.928 --> 03:53:18.333
ALL: Short rest.

03:53:18.333 --> 03:53:20.304
MATT: No, short rest you can do as many times as
you want, yeah.

03:53:20.304 --> 03:53:21.785
MARK: It's the long rest you can only do once
every day.

03:53:21.785 --> 03:53:25.529
LAURA: You're low on health still, aren't you?

03:53:25.529 --> 03:53:28.630
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I mean, we're fine. Let's do
it.

03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:31.150
MARISHA: If you want to just swim and back. You're
going to swim and come back?

03:53:31.150 --> 03:53:34.449
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to go down, and if I start
running short on air, I'll come back up.

03:53:34.449 --> 03:53:37.235
TALIESIN: We'll have a rope tied.

03:53:37.235 --> 03:53:41.804
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on you, if
we're not going to take short rest, if we're not

03:53:41.804 --> 03:53:43.533
going to take a short rest--

03:53:43.533 --> 03:53:47.006
TRAVIS: No, you don't need to do that. There's no
need, Jester. We'll take a short rest afterwards.

03:53:47.006 --> 03:53:48.791
Just a quick little recon.

03:53:48.791 --> 03:53:50.242
ASHLEY: Here. Tie it around.

03:53:50.242 --> 03:53:53.034
TRAVIS: I drop the rope and jump in.

03:53:53.034 --> 03:53:58.652
SAM: As they're doing this, I'm going to come up
to Caleb and tap him on the shoulder and say:

03:53:58.652 --> 03:54:07.058
Caleb, look what I found! I think this is the bowl
that Cali was talking about.

03:54:07.058 --> 03:54:13.129
LIAM: I instantly cast Identify-- it takes one
minute-- on the two vials and the bowl.

03:54:13.129 --> 03:54:14.859
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:54:14.859 --> 03:54:16.203
LIAM: I'm over here.

03:54:16.203 --> 03:54:17.537
LAURA: On the other side.

03:54:17.537 --> 03:54:18.678
MATT: You went all the way around the other side?

03:54:18.678 --> 03:54:21.540
MARK: I have a minus one, it's a 13. She's pretty
oblivious.

03:54:21.540 --> 03:54:22.735
MATT: No, there's no way.

03:54:22.735 --> 03:54:26.245
TALIESIN: We are the worst people.

03:54:26.245 --> 03:54:29.604
MARK: As if I didn't know that coming in.

03:54:29.604 --> 03:54:31.279
LIAM: We might be the third from the worst
people.

03:54:31.279 --> 03:54:36.095
MARISHA: "As if I didn't know that coming here."
That's the worst thing anyone has said about us.

03:54:36.095 --> 03:54:38.488
MARK: I know how The Mighty Nein works.

03:54:38.488 --> 03:54:58.078
MATT: The bowl is magical. It is used as a
communion device. When granted with enough blood

03:54:58.078 --> 03:55:08.686
and given the proper ritual, it's used to acquire
auguries, various bits of divination, and

03:55:08.686 --> 03:55:14.680
communication across the Divine Gate with whatever
this Scaled Tyrant may be.

03:55:14.680 --> 03:55:17.740
LIAM: But it needs a lot of blood?

03:55:17.740 --> 03:55:19.791
MATT: It needs enough to fill the bowl.

03:55:19.791 --> 03:55:27.913
LAIM: I can tell from my Identify spell that its
purpose is to speak with this thing on the other

03:55:27.913 --> 03:55:29.322
side, this deity?

03:55:29.322 --> 03:55:31.448
MATT: Some sort of communion, that's all you can
make out from it.

03:55:31.448 --> 03:55:32.748
LIAM: What about the vials?

03:55:32.748 --> 03:55:36.445
MATT: The vials are not magically enchanted.

03:55:36.445 --> 03:55:44.624
LIAM: That sucks. Nothing to be told, okay. I
don't want this.

03:55:44.624 --> 03:55:46.366
MATT: Hold on, Identify should--

03:55:46.366 --> 03:55:47.667
SAM: You don't want the bowl?

03:55:47.667 --> 03:55:48.700
LIAM: No.

03:55:48.700 --> 03:55:51.972
SAM: Okay. Do you think it's bad to give it to
her?

03:55:51.972 --> 03:55:53.627
ASHLEY: I'm not there, but--

03:55:53.627 --> 03:55:56.965
SAM: Do you think it's bad to give it to her?

03:55:56.965 --> 03:56:02.002
LIAM: I don't know. It is not of any use to us, I
don't think.

03:56:02.002 --> 03:56:05.245
SAM: Okay. Then let's give it to her.

03:56:05.245 --> 03:56:10.515
LIAM: I stick it into my satchel for the time
being.

03:56:10.515 --> 03:56:19.324
MATT: Okay. What are you guys doing? You're
underwater. Fjord, you're swimming down, going

03:56:19.324 --> 03:56:26.414
through the darkness, keeping your way there. It
goes under for about 30 feet, 40 feet. You're

03:56:26.414 --> 03:56:36.040
pulling your way across the ceiling as it levels
out, curves a bit, straightens. Lungs start to

03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:40.039
hurt a little bit, but you're still holding your
breath okay, pulling your way through this

03:56:40.039 --> 03:56:41.189
darkness.

03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:42.626
LAURA: This makes me feel so uncomfortable.

03:56:42.626 --> 03:56:43.979
TALIESIN: I'm not okay with this.

03:56:43.979 --> 03:56:45.379
TRAVIS: This is college all over again.

03:56:45.379 --> 03:56:51.471
MATT: You pull under, and you're uncertain as to
where it'll end, and that brief little peaking

03:56:51.471 --> 03:56:55.799
fear in the back of your mind, flashes and
memories of being under the ocean, of the

03:56:55.799 --> 03:57:02.353
shipwreck, of looking up and not knowing which
direction was up. That gives you this brief surge

03:57:02.353 --> 03:57:09.410
of vertigo. You stop for a second, and a couple
bubbles escape. Go ahead and make a constitution

03:57:09.410 --> 03:57:16.017
saving throw.

03:57:16.017 --> 03:57:17.196
TRAVIS: 21.

03:57:17.196 --> 03:57:27.807
MATT: 21. You push through, continue, swim across,
swim. "Learn." You come up, and all of a sudden

03:57:27.807 --> 03:57:34.299
you can see now, it begins to rise up once more,
and you begin to swim up, pull across the front,

03:57:34.299 --> 03:57:43.027
and then suddenly your fingers break water, but
you do so carefully. Take a breath slowly as your

03:57:43.027 --> 03:57:51.241
head emerges from the dark water in what is a
large, darkened chamber. Make a perception check

03:57:51.341 --> 03:57:53.949
with disadvantage.

03:57:53.949 --> 03:57:56.345
TRAVIS: Six.

03:57:56.345 --> 03:58:06.086
MATT: You see where this 15, 20-foot pool that
you've emerged from opens up into this chamber

03:58:06.086 --> 03:58:12.258
that is filled with low water and a number of
divots and pools within. The bars of land are

03:58:12.258 --> 03:58:23.118
limited and thin. You see from the peripheral of
your vision, before it ends at that point, roughly

03:58:23.118 --> 03:58:33.792
five or six more of these creatures. You see a
very faint glow in the distance, a number of

03:58:33.792 --> 03:58:47.476
objects that are piled and shoved into a central
place. You see elements, old pieces of stone

03:58:47.476 --> 03:58:55.187
structures that have fallen in. This chamber
inside here had a built or constructed purpose

03:58:55.271 --> 03:59:02.269
long ago, and since has crumbled as the earth has
shifted. That's as much as you can make out.

03:59:02.269 --> 03:59:12.050
TRAVIS: I'll take a big breath, blow it all the
way out. (inhales deeply) Go back under, push back.

03:59:12.050 --> 03:59:18.064
MATT: Okay, cool. Making your way through, now you
know the path is there, the confidence because you

03:59:18.064 --> 03:59:22.005
know there is air eventually helps you push
through. You make it halfway through--

03:59:22.005 --> 03:59:24.006
TRAVIS: What's the depth like as I'm going
through?

03:59:24.006 --> 03:59:25.706
MATT: It's about 15, 20 feet.

03:59:25.706 --> 03:59:26.812
TRAVIS: So I can see the bottom?

03:59:26.812 --> 03:59:27.940
MATT: You can see the bottom, yeah.

03:59:27.940 --> 03:59:29.007
TRAVIS: That's not so bad.

03:59:29.007 --> 03:59:33.420
MATT: You do manage to come out the other side,
emerge, and take your breath. Now that you've been

03:59:33.420 --> 03:59:35.857
through it once, and managed to go through it a
little more confidently, you didn't have to worry

03:59:35.857 --> 03:59:37.057
about holding your breath.

03:59:37.057 --> 03:59:38.631
LAURA: Oh my god, are you okay?

03:59:38.631 --> 03:59:43.535
TRAVIS: Yeah. There's another room. There's five
more of them, if I remember.

03:59:43.535 --> 03:59:44.721
MARK: Those things?

03:59:44.721 --> 03:59:49.822
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's a whole other cavern.
There's ruins and objects and all sorts of stuff.

03:59:49.822 --> 03:59:51.825
We're not done with this by a damn sight.

03:59:51.825 --> 03:59:59.866
MARISHA: Our job was to secure the safehouse. We
can collapse this and say job done.

03:59:59.866 --> 04:00:04.995
TRAVIS: There were so many things. There were
crates and objects.

04:00:04.995 --> 04:00:07.257
MARISHA: That changes things.

04:00:07.257 --> 04:00:11.551
LAURA: What if the safehouse is that other tunnel?
What if this whole thing is the safehouse?

04:00:11.551 --> 04:00:13.044
TRAVIS: Could be underneath it.

04:00:13.044 --> 04:00:17.322
LIAM: What if it's beyond even what Fjord has just
seen? We do not know what we are talking about yet.

04:00:17.322 --> 04:00:23.811
TRAVIS: We could guard this entrance and rest up
for a bit, get ourselves together and carry

04:00:23.811 --> 04:00:29.589
through. It's not that far. I think everybody
could make it. I certainly could help somebody if

04:00:29.589 --> 04:00:31.312
they're not a very good swimmer, but--

04:00:31.312 --> 04:00:33.751
MARISHA: Maybe run a line. Have the rope in case.

04:00:33.751 --> 04:00:40.551
LIAM: You know, we could rest up here on the back
corner of this chamber. I could cast my silver

04:00:40.551 --> 04:00:45.936
thread across this pool here on the other side. If
anything comes through, it wakes us up. We'll be

04:00:45.936 --> 04:00:48.049
ready. We get ready for going further and--

04:00:48.049 --> 04:00:51.160
TALIESIN: We could even cast the thread and sleep
upstairs.

04:00:51.160 --> 04:00:56.143
TRAVIS: We could. I know there are five, but I
think we use this funnel point as a fatal funnel,

04:00:56.143 --> 04:01:01.375
right? We make them come through one at a time. We
send some bait, bring them back through, but only

04:01:01.375 --> 04:01:04.549
when we're ready. What do you think?

04:01:04.549 --> 04:01:07.602
LAURA: I'm okay with that.

04:01:07.602 --> 04:01:09.973
TALIESIN: Sure.

04:01:09.973 --> 04:01:15.828
TRAVIS: Cali?

04:01:15.828 --> 04:01:21.990
MARK: I want to help you guys, I really do, but if
what I'm looking for is not here, I've got to try

04:01:21.990 --> 04:01:28.047
and find it. I've got to stop these people getting
it. The longer I spend here, if it's not here, the

04:01:28.047 --> 04:01:31.452
better chance they have of finding it, and I can't
let that happen.

04:01:31.452 --> 04:01:34.934
LIAM: What if you spend one more night with us,
here?

04:01:34.934 --> 04:01:43.304
MARK: I really want to, Mr. Caleb. Like, you all
seem so nice and you're the first people I could

04:01:43.304 --> 04:01:47.034
even say that I've made friends with, but this is
too important.

04:01:47.034 --> 04:01:49.951
LAURA: I just can't believe we didn't find that
bowl for you.

04:01:49.951 --> 04:01:57.078
MARK: Maybe I messed up. Like I said, I'm not very
good in the outside world, and I thought that I

04:01:57.078 --> 04:01:59.162
found it here, but-- It's fine.

04:01:59.162 --> 04:02:06.248
LIAM: Tell us again. What do you need it for? What
are your intentions with it? Honestly, look me in

04:02:06.248 --> 04:02:08.853
the eye. What do you mean to do with this thing
when you find it?

04:02:08.853 --> 04:02:10.883
MARK: Mr. Caleb, I want to destroy it.

04:02:10.883 --> 04:02:13.020
LIAM: How will you destroy it?

04:02:13.020 --> 04:02:23.501
MARK: To be honest with you, I don't know. I know
I'll find a way if I have to, but-- I just-- The

04:02:23.501 --> 04:02:30.153
biggest thing I'm afraid of is that the cult and
Serissa, they'll find somebody like me. They'll

04:02:30.153 --> 04:02:35.554
find somebody descended from an ancient dragon
like I was. Then they can do this all again. I got

04:02:35.554 --> 04:02:38.078
away once. I can't let that happen to someone
else.

04:02:38.078 --> 04:02:39.521
LIAM: Yasha, will you come here, please?

04:02:39.521 --> 04:02:41.018
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:02:41.018 --> 04:02:43.662
LIAM: I need your help. Mollymauk, will you come
here, please?

04:02:43.662 --> 04:02:45.124
TALIESIN: Yeah, sure.

04:02:45.124 --> 04:02:47.849
LIAM: Beauregard, Fjord, will you come here,
please?

04:02:47.849 --> 04:02:48.951
MARISHA: What?

04:02:48.951 --> 04:02:49.767
TRAVIS: Sure.

04:02:49.767 --> 04:02:51.912
LIAM: I start to move away from Cali.

04:02:51.912 --> 04:02:55.581
LAURA: Why don't you want me to come here,
please?

04:02:55.581 --> 04:03:00.550
LIAM: Would you come back with me, Jester,
please?

04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:01.908
LAURA: Whatever.

04:03:01.908 --> 04:03:04.303
MARK: (softly) What's going on?

04:03:04.303 --> 04:03:12.684
LIAM: Once there is a defensive wall between me
and Cali, I pull the bowl out of my bag.

04:03:12.684 --> 04:03:14.015
MARK: Where did you find that?

04:03:14.015 --> 04:03:20.309
LAURA: (gasps) Caleb, you found the bowl! I'm so
proud of you.

04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:21.580
LIAM: No.

04:03:21.580 --> 04:03:22.765
MATT: (Jester voice) "I'm so proud of you."

04:03:22.765 --> 04:03:24.104
LAURA: Yeah, Kiri's proud of you, too.

04:03:24.104 --> 04:03:33.578
LIAM: No, Kiri. Bren found the bowl. Cali, I would
like to help you, but this thing is... powerful.

04:03:33.578 --> 04:03:34.860
MARK: Yes.

04:03:34.860 --> 04:03:38.004
LIAM: And I met you ten hours ago?

04:03:38.004 --> 04:03:47.154
MARK: Mr. Caleb, all I can tell you is that the
whole reason I came here is to find that, so-- Let

04:03:47.154 --> 04:03:51.165
me put it this way. You care about these people?
You care about this group?

04:03:51.165 --> 04:03:52.304
LIAM: Yeah, I do.

04:03:52.304 --> 04:03:58.391
MARK: Then don't keep that thing. The cult will
find you. I know more about them than you. I can

04:03:58.391 --> 04:04:00.542
hide. I can stay away from them.

04:04:00.542 --> 04:04:04.340
LIAM: Well, I have a wonderful compromise. You
know, we can all camp down here as I suggested,

04:04:04.340 --> 04:04:09.712
you included. In the morning, my good friend
Jester can get to the bottom of your intentions

04:04:09.712 --> 04:04:12.827
for good. For real.

04:04:12.827 --> 04:04:14.366
MARISHA: Caleb's still holding the bowl?

04:04:14.366 --> 04:04:15.411
MATT: Mm-hmm.

04:04:15.411 --> 04:04:17.367
MARISHA: Can I snatch it out of his hand real
quick?

04:04:17.367 --> 04:04:22.436
MATT: Go ahead. Make a dexterity check, opposed.

04:04:22.436 --> 04:04:25.582
MARISHA: Just a straight dex check?

04:04:25.582 --> 04:04:28.285
LIAM: What do I do, dex as well? Oh, it's gonna be
so good.

04:04:28.285 --> 04:04:29.845
MATT: Disadvantage for you because you weren't
expecting it.

04:04:29.845 --> 04:04:31.892
MARISHA: It's not great.

04:04:31.892 --> 04:04:39.661
LIAM: That's a two, so I think this story is over.
Aw, the second one was an 18. Aw. Three.

04:04:39.661 --> 04:04:41.551
MARISHA: Ten.

04:04:41.551 --> 04:04:46.686
MATT: The bowl leaves your hand. Now Beau's
holding it.

04:04:46.686 --> 04:04:49.184
MARISHA: I'm playing a game of keep-away.

04:04:49.184 --> 04:04:50.524
TRAVIS: Are you natural Beau or big-ass Beau?

04:04:50.524 --> 04:04:52.838
MATT: No, it's faded.

04:04:52.838 --> 04:04:57.487
MARISHA: (sing-songy) Caleb.

04:04:57.487 --> 04:05:04.247
LIAM: Why would you not want to wait 12 hours to
see if this woman's intentions are true or not?

04:05:04.247 --> 04:05:05.420
LAURA: What difference does it make?

04:05:05.420 --> 04:05:07.000
LIAM: What difference does it make?! This bowl--

04:05:07.000 --> 04:05:09.435
LAURA: You don't have it in your hand anymore,
Caleb.

04:05:09.435 --> 04:05:17.164
LIAM: This bowl that I am talking about can be
used to speak to one of the most evil entities in

04:05:17.164 --> 04:05:22.783
the history of creation, so I think it warrants
another 12 hours of waiting to get to the bottom

04:05:22.783 --> 04:05:23.872
of things.

04:05:23.872 --> 04:05:27.867
LAURA: I don't think you should stop someone from
talking to a god if they want to talk to a god.

04:05:27.867 --> 04:05:31.395
MARK: I don't want to talk to her. I want to make
that clear.

04:05:31.395 --> 04:05:34.326
ASHLEY: If you want to destroy it, why don't we
just destroy it right here?

04:05:34.326 --> 04:05:36.283
TALIESIN: I don't think it can be.

04:05:36.283 --> 04:05:41.480
MARK: I always thought you'd need something more
impressive to do that, but if we can destroy it

04:05:41.480 --> 04:05:43.340
here, then so be it.

04:05:43.340 --> 04:05:46.995
LIAM: I think it is going to be a little bit
beyond your capabilities to destroy this bowl,

04:05:46.995 --> 04:05:48.075
Yasha.

04:05:48.075 --> 04:05:49.639
ASHLEY: No, I don't mean me.

04:05:49.639 --> 04:06:06.132
MARISHA: Caleb, I respect you and all of your
intentions, but your caution does not get to

04:06:06.132 --> 04:06:08.365
control other people's destinies.

04:06:08.365 --> 04:06:16.888
LIAM: That bowl is used for communicating with
(nervous laugh) the mother of dragons.

04:06:16.888 --> 04:06:23.284
MARK: Are you going to rest now? Are we doing
anything else? Are you resting now, or do you wish

04:06:23.284 --> 04:06:24.974
to take this time now?

04:06:24.974 --> 04:06:32.022
MARISHA: You had no intentions of wanting this
bowl, or needing this bowl, or caring about this

04:06:32.022 --> 04:06:33.959
bowl until Cali came around.

04:06:33.959 --> 04:06:41.005
LIAM: Beauregard. You keep the bowl all night so
that Jester can use the spell she used in the past

04:06:41.005 --> 04:06:47.751
for truth, and then we ask Cali, and I would love
to hear that Cali's intentions are true and good.

04:06:47.751 --> 04:06:50.315
If they're not, we'll find out.

04:06:50.315 --> 04:06:53.270
LAURA: I believe you, Cali. I don't think I need to
cast it on you.

04:06:53.270 --> 04:06:56.435
MARK: But you need to trust each other.

04:06:56.435 --> 04:07:02.900
TALIESIN: Actually, here's an insane thing that
occurred to me. Technically speaking, Charm Person

04:07:02.900 --> 04:07:08.618
lasts a really long time. I cast Friends.

04:07:08.618 --> 04:07:10.352
LIAM: Friends. One minute.

04:07:10.352 --> 04:07:13.841
LAURA: Oh! Well, I can cast Charm Person.

04:07:13.841 --> 04:07:22.680
MARK: You tried to cast something on your friend,
the guide, right? To make him tell the truth. Do

04:07:22.680 --> 04:07:27.892
that on me. I won't resist it. I promise.

04:07:27.892 --> 04:07:32.027
TALIESIN: That's fair. I'm into that.

04:07:32.027 --> 04:07:48.624
LIAM: Yeah, okay. I suggest you tell us the
absolute truth of your intentions with this bowl.

04:07:48.624 --> 04:07:57.640
MARK: I don't want to resist it, so: I intend to
either destroy it, or find somewhere secure that

04:07:57.640 --> 04:08:07.995
the Cult of the Caustic Heart, servants of the
Scaled Tyrant, can't find it, because they knew my

04:08:07.995 --> 04:08:14.664
power. They knew that I'm descended from an
ancient black dragon from far away. If they find

04:08:14.664 --> 04:08:23.253
another one like me, they could do terrible
things. I promise you, Mr. Caleb, I promise you

04:08:23.253 --> 04:08:29.984
that all I want is to right some of the wrongs
that I once did as part of that group. I helped

04:08:29.984 --> 04:08:34.306
kill people; I helped torture people. I've got to
make this right, and that's the only way I can do

04:08:34.306 --> 04:08:39.979
this. I don't know much, but I know that the only
person that can take that thing and make sure it's

04:08:39.979 --> 04:08:41.803
not used for ill is me.

04:08:41.803 --> 04:08:44.336
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb.

04:08:44.336 --> 04:08:47.949
SAM: (snickers) You have the helm.

04:08:47.949 --> 04:08:54.466

expected to bear before we're asking for failure.

04:08:54.466 --> 04:08:56.968
MARK: I don't want you to have to bear this one.

04:08:56.968 --> 04:09:02.907
LIAM: I'm glad for you to take it. I'm a little
surprised at the rest of you for me being

04:09:02.907 --> 04:09:05.180
cautious, but I'm glad for you to take it.

04:09:05.180 --> 04:09:06.566

04:09:06.566 --> 04:09:07.817
TALIESIN: Oh, no. I'm with you.

04:09:07.817 --> 04:09:14.928
MARISHA: I grab Caleb, drag him aside, hand Cali
the bowl, drag Caleb over to a private corner, and

04:09:14.928 --> 04:09:21.619
I say, look. We all have our fucking trauma. You
understand that? We all have our fucking garbage,

04:09:21.619 --> 04:09:30.753
and our dirt, and our shit. But you don't get to
use your skeletons in your closet, your PTSD, to

04:09:30.753 --> 04:09:37.119
be shitty and control other people and what they
want. It does not make you the authority on what's

04:09:37.119 --> 04:09:43.863
right and what's wrong. Just because you think
that you're a shitty person, guess what? We're all

04:09:43.863 --> 04:09:45.591
fucking shitty people.

04:09:45.591 --> 04:09:47.275

MARISHA: I get feeling like shitty people. I don't
speak for the rest of these guys, but I get

04:09:59.245 --> 04:10:05.546
feeling shitty. But it doesn't mean that you get
to impress that on other people and make them feel

04:10:05.546 --> 04:10:08.479
like shitheads just because you are.

04:10:08.479 --> 04:10:13.494
LIAM: Beauregard, what if she had been lying to
us?

04:10:13.494 --> 04:10:18.790

that, and we learn that as a lesson for later on.

seen, Mr. Caleb is the only one who really

04:10:30.676 --> 04:10:38.974
understands how powerful this thing is. Even I
didn't know as much. I appreciate everything that

04:10:38.974 --> 04:10:44.156
you've just said and it's the nicest thing that
anyone's ever done for me. Please don't blame him.

He was doing the right thing.

04:10:46.869 --> 04:10:52.880

isn't the first occurrence of something like this

with him, either.

just a shitty communicator!

LIAM: I told you exactly what I wanted to do, and
why.

MARISHA: The road to hell is paved with good
intentions.

04:11:12.828 --> 04:11:17.742
LIAM: I don't know what you're talking about. And
I walk away from her without saying another word.

wish I could help you with the rest of this, but

know? People will be after this, as soon as I can.

before.

04:11:42.583 --> 04:11:46.808
MATT: You throw it on the ground. It rolls off,
untouched.

04:11:46.808 --> 04:11:48.508
MARK: I'll try Acid Splash as well.

04:11:48.508 --> 04:11:51.139
MATT: All the acid runs off of it, unscathed.

04:11:51.139 --> 04:11:53.065
TRAVIS: Yasha, chuck that shit on the side of the
wall, will you?

04:11:53.065 --> 04:11:57.111
ASHLEY: Wait, is it magical?

04:11:57.111 --> 04:11:58.164
LAURA: Super-duper.

04:11:58.164 --> 04:11:59.386
LIAM: Highly.

04:11:59.386 --> 04:12:10.602
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to take out my Magician's
Judge sword. Because I can try to Dispel Magic.

04:12:10.602 --> 04:12:13.132
I'll try to do it. Might not work.

04:12:13.132 --> 04:12:15.483
MATT: Okay. You're going to strike it as you're
dispelling it? Is that what you're doing?

04:12:15.483 --> 04:12:16.663
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:12:16.663 --> 04:12:24.989
MATT: Okay. You hold your Magician's Judge up, you
lift it over your head, and swing it down with all

04:12:24.989 --> 04:12:29.181
your might. Go ahead and make the check for the
Dispel Magic on the sword.

04:12:29.181 --> 04:12:33.105
ASHLEY: What's that?

04:12:33.105 --> 04:12:46.259
MATT: It's under the description of the sword on
your app. It's a d20 plus-- Not the attack roll;

04:12:46.259 --> 04:12:48.246
it's under the ability.

04:12:48.246 --> 04:12:59.800
ASHLEY: --cast as a 3rd-level and the ability
check bonus for the spell is plus three.

04:12:59.800 --> 04:13:02.299
MATT: Yeah, so roll and add three.

04:13:02.299 --> 04:13:05.473
ASHLEY: 13?

04:13:05.473 --> 04:13:12.039
MATT: 13. As you strike downward, there's a brief
moment where you see a flash of energy as if the

04:13:12.039 --> 04:13:18.664
field is temporarily dissipating whatever magical
connection this object holds. In that brief,

04:13:18.664 --> 04:13:29.737
ever-so-subtle instance of time in which this
marble bowl is left in a brief blip in history, it

04:13:29.737 --> 04:13:39.460
is exposed to the elements. The blade carves
through and shatters. The glow, (explosion)! For

04:13:39.460 --> 04:13:48.414
that instance, there is a brief burst of bright
green, blue, red, white, black energy that

04:13:48.414 --> 04:14:00.306
emanates and this low growling rumble. And, with
that, the bowl and whatever enchantment it held is gone.

04:14:00.306 --> 04:14:01.695
MARK: You did it.

04:14:01.695 --> 04:14:04.915
ASHLEY: Sorry.

04:14:04.915 --> 04:14:10.232
MARK: No! Yasha, you destroyed it! That's exactly
what I wanted to do! I didn't think it'd be possible!

04:14:10.232 --> 04:14:12.911
ASHLEY: I really didn't either. I just--

04:14:12.911 --> 04:14:16.898
TALIESIN: I owe you the biggest drink. Oh my god!

04:14:16.898 --> 04:14:23.421
MARK: Ms. Yasha, though, you need to be careful. I
mean, that thing was connected to the Scaled

04:14:23.421 --> 04:14:31.789
Tyrant and the cultists. If they find out what you've
done, they'll come after you. But I want you to

04:14:31.789 --> 04:14:34.958
know I'll do whatever I can to stop them.

04:14:34.958 --> 04:14:47.134
ASHLEY: Well, hey, (stutters) I just-- I didn't
think that was going to happen so fast, to be

04:14:47.134 --> 04:14:48.067
honest.

04:14:48.149 --> 04:14:49.558
MARK: I don't think any of us did.

04:14:49.558 --> 04:14:53.873
MATT: It's interesting. As it shattered and while
you're having this conversation, there's this

04:14:53.873 --> 04:14:59.636
static electricity around Yasha. Occasionally, as
she brings her hand closer, you watch as these

04:14:59.636 --> 04:15:09.213
little bolts of energy are arcing through here. As
it slowly fades, you can see there's a slight

04:15:09.213 --> 04:15:13.907
faint glow of the symbol she holds at her belt
that eventually goes mundane as well.

04:15:13.907 --> 04:15:18.896
MARK: Can I rush over and hug Yasha for what she's
done? I throw my arms around you, draconic claw

04:15:18.896 --> 04:15:20.793
piercing in a little bit.

04:15:20.793 --> 04:15:23.744
ASHLEY: I keep my arms down, but I give her a
pat.

04:15:23.744 --> 04:15:27.444
MARK: Thank you so much. You don't understand what
this means.

04:15:27.444 --> 04:15:38.792
ASHLEY: You're welcome. I'm glad it was me and not
you so you don't get in trouble or you're not

04:15:38.792 --> 04:15:40.645
marked or anything.

04:15:40.645 --> 04:15:46.535
MARK: I'm sure that the Scaled Tyrant is looking
for me in other ways, but thank you. You guys,

04:15:46.535 --> 04:15:52.994
I've never had people look after me and help me
like this before. You guys are probably the first

04:15:52.994 --> 04:15:57.543
friends I've ever had. Where do you guys normally
stay, if I need to come and find you?

04:15:57.543 --> 04:16:01.458
TRAVIS: We're actually traveling all around. I was
going to ask: Where do you go now, since you've

04:16:01.458 --> 04:16:03.109
achieved your objective?

04:16:03.109 --> 04:16:07.279
MARK: I'll head back to Port Damali. There's other
artifacts I need to find and destroy, but now I

04:16:07.279 --> 04:16:10.626
know that they can be. That's what I'm going to
focus on.

04:16:10.626 --> 04:16:14.364
TRAVIS: We might find our way down to the
Menagerie Coast at some point, and if we do, we'll

04:16:14.364 --> 04:16:15.832
give you a look.

04:16:15.832 --> 04:16:17.286
MARK: I'd really like that, please.

04:16:17.286 --> 04:16:23.419
Can I write to you if I leave letters? Can
we be pen pals, Jester?

04:16:23.419 --> 04:16:26.088
LAURA: Oh my god, I will send all the letters,
Cali!

04:16:26.088 --> 04:16:27.434
MARK: Oh, yes, absolutely!

04:16:27.434 --> 04:16:28.571
LAURA: That would make me so happy!

04:16:28.571 --> 04:16:29.983
MARK: I'm going to write you letters all the
time!

04:16:29.983 --> 04:16:31.842
LAURA: I'm going to write you letters back all the
time, okay?

04:16:31.842 --> 04:16:33.226
MARK: Hugs.

04:16:33.226 --> 04:16:34.805
LAURA: Hugs, hugs, hugs.

04:16:34.805 --> 04:16:44.717
ASHLEY: I do have a question. The jewels in the
bowl: are they still there?

04:16:44.717 --> 04:16:46.182
LAURA: What jewels?

04:16:46.182 --> 04:16:47.744
ASHLEY: In the eyeballs.

04:16:47.744 --> 04:16:52.556
MATT: Make an investigation check to search for
where the shards all landed.

04:16:52.556 --> 04:16:56.794
MARK: I'm going to start putting some of my stuff
together to get ready to leave, but I'm going to

04:16:56.794 --> 04:17:00.110
head over to Nott, because Caleb's walked off.

04:17:00.110 --> 04:17:02.286
ASHLEY: Six.

04:17:02.286 --> 04:17:04.335
MARK: Nott-- Bren?

04:17:04.335 --> 04:17:06.133
SAM: You can just go with Nott.

04:17:06.133 --> 04:17:08.444
MARK: Okay. You seem to know Mr. Caleb really
well.

04:17:08.444 --> 04:17:09.527
SAM: I do.

04:17:09.527 --> 04:17:10.905
MARK: Can you give him something for me?

04:17:10.905 --> 04:17:12.382
SAM: Sure.

04:17:12.382 --> 04:17:20.183
MARK: I'm going to give Nott the Scroll of
Invisibility that I never used. This is for your

04:17:20.183 --> 04:17:24.375
help, for Mr. Caleb's help, and all of you. It's
not much, but it's something.

04:17:24.375 --> 04:17:27.521
SAM: This is very nice of you.

04:17:27.521 --> 04:17:33.437
MARK: You don't know what you've done for me, so
this is the least I can do. I really do understand

04:17:33.437 --> 04:17:34.558
what he did.

04:17:34.558 --> 04:17:38.403
SAM: He has-- yes.

04:17:38.403 --> 04:17:40.530
MARK: Thank you.

04:17:40.530 --> 04:17:53.207
SAM: You're welcome? Thank you. It was lovely to
meet you-- and he really does have the best of

04:17:53.207 --> 04:17:54.650
intentions.

04:17:54.650 --> 04:17:58.302
MARK: I know he does, and I'm sure he's going to
be a really powerful wizard one day.

04:17:58.302 --> 04:17:59.428
SAM: I know he will be.

04:17:59.428 --> 04:18:00.452
MARK: I know he will.

04:18:00.452 --> 04:18:02.985
SAM: Yes, he will! Why are you saying it like
that? Because he will.

04:18:02.985 --> 04:18:04.133
MARK: Because you are!

04:18:04.133 --> 04:18:04.962
SAM: Okay!

04:18:04.962 --> 04:18:11.753
(laughter)

04:18:11.753 --> 04:18:14.601
MARK: I'll say my goodbyes and come up and shake
Fjord's hand.

04:18:14.601 --> 04:18:16.856
TRAVIS: Strong grip.

04:18:16.856 --> 04:18:21.886
MARK: I won't use the dragon one. Go up to
Mollymauk, shake hands.

04:18:21.886 --> 04:18:23.230
TALIESIN: Oh, the dragon one.

04:18:23.230 --> 04:18:24.691
ASHLEY: The dragon one.

04:18:24.691 --> 04:18:27.548
MARK: Thank you?

04:18:27.548 --> 04:18:31.915
ASHLEY: I wouldn't have skinned you, that was just
a joke in the beginning.

04:18:31.915 --> 04:18:34.865
MARK: Oh, good. Don't do that, please.

04:18:34.865 --> 04:18:39.171
ASHLEY: I won't-- (quietly) I would have, but I
just--

04:18:39.171 --> 04:18:41.882
MARK: Good luck with clearing this out, but I've
got to go.

04:18:41.882 --> 04:18:43.489
LAURA: Be careful, okay?

04:18:43.489 --> 04:18:45.131
MARK: I will, I promise. We'll write letters.

04:18:45.131 --> 04:18:46.488
LAURA: Yes, of course!

04:18:46.488 --> 04:18:48.466
TRAVIS: Remember, follow the daggers on the way
out, they mark your way.

04:18:48.466 --> 04:18:50.568
MARK: I will do. Yeah, I've got to keep out for
that troll, right?

04:18:50.568 --> 04:18:52.824
SAM: We were supposed to get some sort of
bracelet.

04:18:52.824 --> 04:18:54.967
MARISHA: Troll, and also really big alligators.

04:18:54.967 --> 04:18:56.528
MARK: Well, you got my scroll.

04:18:56.528 --> 04:18:59.168
SAM: Over shit!

04:18:59.168 --> 04:19:03.149
MARK: I'll make my way out.

04:19:03.149 --> 04:19:10.249
MATT: Okay. Cali climbs the rope, with a brief
glimmer of her feet vanishing into the tunnel

04:19:10.249 --> 04:19:15.253
above. You all settle in to rest and decide what
you're going to do with the rest of this chamber,

04:19:15.253 --> 04:19:19.576
if anything. And that's where we'll end tonight's
game.

04:19:19.576 --> 04:19:22.165
LIAM: Drama!

04:19:22.165 --> 04:19:23.621
MATT: Good drama! It's fun.

04:19:23.621 --> 04:19:26.657
MARISHA: I love you.

04:19:26.657 --> 04:19:28.059
TRAVIS: Dram-o-mine!

04:19:28.059 --> 04:19:31.236
MATT: Oh man. Good game. Mark, thank you for
coming on!

04:19:31.236 --> 04:19:38.272
MARK: No, thank you guys all so much! I've said
this to Matt, but I've been hearing stories of Vox

04:19:38.272 --> 04:19:42.065
Machina since before you guys started streaming
from Matt, and I've watched the whole show, so

04:19:42.065 --> 04:19:44.709
this was super awesome to get to be here and play
with you guys.

04:19:44.709 --> 04:19:47.441
MARISHA: Tell them where to find you on High
Rollers!

04:19:47.441 --> 04:19:53.837
MARK: Yeah, so if you'd like to see me GM, I do a
show called High Rollers every Sunday at 5:00pm

04:19:53.837 --> 04:20:00.806
UK-time. I think it's like 9:00am PST? That's on
twitch.tv/Yogscast. We just finished our first

04:20:00.806 --> 04:20:05.225
two-and-a-half-year campaign, but on July 1st,
we're starting our brand new campaign.

04:20:05.225 --> 04:20:07.060
ALL: Wow!

04:20:07.060 --> 04:20:08.691
MARK: That'll be our brand-new thing, so please
come and watch that.

04:20:08.691 --> 04:20:10.168
LIAM: God, I can't believe that's already been
that long.

04:20:10.168 --> 04:20:13.025
MARK: Well, when you guys started, we were
inspired by Crit Role, and we started our show,

04:20:13.025 --> 04:20:16.690
and we've gotten to the next part of our
adventures.

04:20:16.690 --> 04:20:20.623
MARISHA: Yogscast is great, you guys are great,
the cast is great--

04:20:20.623 --> 04:20:22.832
MARK: High Rollers is great, I'm not going to talk
about the rest of Yogscast.

04:20:22.832 --> 04:20:24.483
MATT: Yeah, High Rollers is great!

04:20:24.483 --> 04:20:29.136
MARK: Yeah, you can also see me on the Stream of
Many Eyes. I'm going to be DMing a game for

04:20:29.136 --> 04:20:33.344
Ashley, Taliesin, and Sam on Sunday, along with
some other people as well.

04:20:33.344 --> 04:20:35.635
ASHLEY: I can't wait.

04:20:35.635 --> 04:20:37.193
MARK: Thank you guys all so much, that was
awesome.

04:20:37.193 --> 04:20:38.611
MATT: Thank you for coming.

04:20:38.611 --> 04:20:39.795
MARISHA: Yeah, Cali!

04:20:39.795 --> 04:20:44.176
MATT: Thank you guys for hanging on! Thank you D&amp;amp;D
Beyond for being amazing. We love you guys so

04:20:44.176 --> 04:20:48.455
much. We'll see you soon, and is it Thursday yet?
Good night.

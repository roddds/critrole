00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.930
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.330
of Critical Role where a bunch of us nerdy-ass

3
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.524
voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:08.176
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:10.130
MATT: Indeed.

6
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.040
We missed you guys for last week

7
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.880
but you had a chance to check out

8
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.260
our amazing Vox Machina Wedding One-Shot.

9
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.110
We hope you had a chance to check it out.

10
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.610
If you haven't yet, it's available on our YouTube.

11
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.290
It's kind of awesome.

12
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.910
We do have a few announcements

13
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.000
to get to before we get into tonight's episode,

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.060
beginning with one of our two sponsors, NordVPN.

15
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.640
Sam, if you don't mind taking it away?

16
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.330
SAM: Guys, new sponsor tonight, NordVPN.

17
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.280
But bleep, block, blork, leet haxors,

18
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.820
don't call me Sam, use my Dark Net user name,

19
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.297
blackwillow73@aol.com.

20
00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:49.690
Yeah, I've been spinning my web,

21
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.700
cracking some crypto all day.

22
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.470
You know, doing some brute force spear fishing,

23
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.553
jail-breaking the malware,

24
00:00:56.553 --> 00:01:00.420
all for the lulz, hacker style.

25
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.097
Now it's time to jack into the mainframe.

26
00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.810
(laughter)

27
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.440
With some crash code I devved up.

28
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.456
Here we go, oh, firewall with a data net,

29
00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:14.990
(scoffs) easy money, I'll go through the backdoor.

30
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.920
Password, (scoffs), it's swordfish, it's always swordfish.

31
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.400
What's this?

32
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.040
NordVPN is protecting my target?

33
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.510
Oh guys, NordVPN is a personal virtual

34
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.870
private network service provider with

35
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.330
more than 5,000 servers in 60 countries

36
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.360
and they're sponsoring tonight's episode of Critical Role.

37
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.420
Let's see if I can hack through

38
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.175
NordVPN's elegant, yet easy to use system.

39
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.120
Running syshack.exe.

40
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.850
Uploading the virus.

41
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.000
Re-flopping the binary.

42
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.450
God, no!

43
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.420
Iced out, me, blackwillow73?!

44
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.100
Listen, cybersecurity may seem complex

45
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.310
but NordVPN makes it easy with cutting edge tech

46
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.351
that shields your internet activity from hackers.

47
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:07.740
(laughter)

48
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.550
From hackers like me.

49
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.920
It protects you on public wifi networks,

50
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.800
even blocks annoying ads.

51
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.970
But I've got one more digital ace up my sleeve.

52
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.620
Debugging the worm, defragging the root kit,

53
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.357
gleaming the cube.

54
00:02:23.357 --> 00:02:24.340
No!

55
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.035
My system's offline, I've been sliced.

56
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.550
These NordVPN servers are super fast

57
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.710
and their users get unlimited bandwidth

58
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.470
for all their internet needs and right now,

59
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.520
they have a special offer for you Critters

60
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.400

61

and use the code Critical Role,

62
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.400
you get 75%,

63
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.120
75% off?

64
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.350
Jesus, that's a lot.

65
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.220
75% off a three year plan and an extra month free.

66
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.750
Protect yourself online today.

67
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.220
Back to you, Matt.

68
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.940
TRAVIS: Wow.

69
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.430
LAURA: Are you looking at Matt?

70
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.970
MATT: I can't tell, I feel like somewhere,

71
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.520
Matt Lillard's getting a nosebleed and doesn't know why.

72
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.353
I'm so sorry.

73
00:03:10.353 --> 00:03:13.380
TALIESIN: Angelina Jolie owes us a sequel to Hackers now.

74
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.200
TRAVIS: We hacked a new hope.
MATT: Hack the planet, guys.

75
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.033
Hack the planet.

76
00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:19.037
TALIESIN: I love how they--
TRAVIS: Hack the planet.

77
00:03:19.037 --> 00:03:19.880
TALIESIN: They can see your screensaver

78
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.340
in the reflection in your glasses.

79
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.173
SAM: Oh no.

80
00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:24.494
(laughter)

81
00:03:24.494 --> 00:03:25.728
SAM: I'm hacking right now, guys.

82
00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:28.160
MATT: All right, thank you, Sam.

83
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.030
Thank you, Sam.
TALIESIN: Thank you, Sam.

84
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.797
MATT: Thank you, NordVPN.

85
00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:35.020
The other part of good news is because

86
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.490
NordVPN came in today, D&amp;D Beyond, you are absolved

87
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.340
(laughter)

88
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.470
of Sam Riegel skewering your wonderful service.

89
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.960
So I get to say huge thanks to D&amp;D Beyond

90
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.520
for being a continued sponsor and supporter

91
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.260
of Campaign Two along with us for now looking up

92
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.240
like two years in the next few months, which is crazy.

93
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.060
If you guys haven't checked it out

94
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.440
or if it's your first time hearing about it,

95
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.350
D&amp;D Beyond is an amazing online digital service

96
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.260
for keeping track of all your D&amp;D character elements,

97
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.510
all your campaign elements, monsters,

98
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.780
magical items both official and home-brewed,

99
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.870
adventure settings, it's good stuff.

100
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.090
We use it here on the show, it's amazing,

101
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.600
check it out at d&amp;dbeyond.link/criticalrole

102
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.083
for additional information and what they're all about.

103
00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:21.190
Next week, we're taking a break from

104
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.110
our regularly scheduled episode of Critical Role.

105
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.140
I will be flying to Sweden because I will

106
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.380
be at Heroes Comic-Con Stockholm in Sweden.

107
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.280
I'm excited to meet a bunch of the Critters

108
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.220
up there in the Northern European area.

109
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.750
I've only been to Sweden once

110
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.170
like 15 years ago in Goteborg.

111
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.390
so I've been really excited to actually check out

112
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.600
Stockholm for the first time and meet a bunch of you folks.

113
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.120
If you want to check out details about it,

114
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.560
go to critrole.com/events to figure out

115
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.150
what's going on that weekend if you happen to be coming.

116
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.310
I'm excited to see you guys.
TRAVIS: Marisha, you can

117
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.760
do an accent from Sweden, right?

118
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.593
MARISHA: Oh, <i>ja.</i>

119
00:04:51.593 --> 00:04:53.680
<i>Hallo.</i>
MATT: No, I have to go there.

120
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.920
MARISHA: Oh, <i>ja.</i>

121
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.860
Kitty cat fireball, <i>ja.</i>

122
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.350
MATT: That's really not--

123
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.190
LAURA: It's from Sweden, I understand now.

124
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.992
MATT: I've been there and most people

125
00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:05.476
don't have accents, actually.

126
00:05:05.476 --> 00:05:06.734
And,

127
00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:07.567
this fly is going to be a problem.

128
00:05:07.567 --> 00:05:09.204
Can you hack the fly for us, Sam?

129
00:05:09.204 --> 00:05:11.120
LAURA: Hold on. Let me get a kitchen knife.

130
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.470
SAM: Starting my sys.ini file.

131
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.350
MATT: Oh, god.

132
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.977
SAM: Got my Gateway 2000.

133
00:05:17.977 --> 00:05:20.117
(laughter)

134
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.142
TRAVIS: Netscape baby, Netscape.

135
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.030
SAM: Hacked.

136
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.887
That fly will be dead in 15 to 20 days.

137
00:05:27.887 --> 00:05:30.960
(laughter)

138
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.943
He just doesn't know it yet.

139
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.250
MATT: As a person that did IT for

140
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.310
a number of years, this hurts my soul.

141
00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:40.622
All right, anyway.

142
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.760
Stockholm.

143
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.690
Also, as we continue work on the animated series,

144
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.280
The Legend of Vox Machina, we want to start including

145
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.500
elements of you guys as part of the creative process.

146
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.590
We are now asking for your help

147
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.220
to design a tavern keeper character

148
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.950
that will be appearing in the series.

149
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.530
TRAVIS: Yeah!

150
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.020

153
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.450
what the tavern keeper's going to be

154
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.830
that you guys have helped brought to life.

155
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.309
Head there now, critrole.com/wanted to be part of this

156
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:19.170

that Tuesday to figure it out, super excited.

158
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.700
LIAM: ♪ Wanted. ♪

159
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.323
LAURA: I can't organize my dice

160
00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:27.865
because of all of Sam's hacker gear.

161
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.290
SAM: Let me see what I can do.

162
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.610
It's been hacked.

163
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.870
LAURA: I don't understand.

164
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.450
MATT: I'm not going to lie, I kind of like

165
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.000
this Mr. Robot re-inventioning.

166
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.600
I would watch the shit out of this version.

167
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.160
TRAVIS: Just un-jack him, Laura.

168
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.310
SAM: Oh, yeah.

169
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.580
LIAM: The Rami Malek thing is--
MARISHA: I was going to say, too far.

170
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.371
SAM: No!

171
00:06:47.371 --> 00:06:49.977
I've been sliced.
MATT: Okay.

172
00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.398
(laughter)

173
00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:52.231
Oh my god.

174
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:57.316
LIAM: Could you give us a solid
six seconds of monotone, please?

175
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.790
SAM: Mono, oh, you mean Rami Malek monotone?

176
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.136
LIAM: Yeah.

177
00:07:01.136 --> 00:07:03.820
SAM: (mumbled) I don't know what you're talking about.

178
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.350
MATT: That's really good.

179
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.183
All right.

180
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.250
Laura.
LAURA: Oh.

181
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.954
MATT: Hi.
LAURA: Hi.

182
00:07:10.954 --> 00:07:13.683
LAURA: Oh well, darlings, I don't know

183
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:17.331
if you noticed during the one-shot but--

184
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:18.210
TALIESIN: Oh look, look at that.

185
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.830
LAURA: Our fabulous Vex and Percy wedding ring

186
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.710
which we designed.
TALIESIN: We did.

187
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.037
LAURA: Well, we helped design.
TALIESIN: Yeah, they helped, too.

188
00:07:25.037 --> 00:07:26.470
(laughs)

189
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.660
LAURA: Are available for pre-order right now

190
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.410
in the shop in the US, so check them out if you want to.

191
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.090
They're pretty, they're fancy, they're Vexy.

192
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.700
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
SAM: Wow.

193
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.900
LAURA: Yeah, I just made that up on the spot.

194
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.850
There's a reason I don't do the promos.

195
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.390
MATT: There's something so elegant about the contrast

196
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.810
of this beautiful ring and a Vex'ahlia persona

197
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.069
and a Casa Bonita Dive Team t-shirt.

198
00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.540
(laughter)

199
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.611
It just spells quality.

200
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:55.800
SAM: ♪ Casa Bonita ♪

201
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.710
MATT: Oh, yeah.

202
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.176
Thank you, Laura.

203
00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:00.726
Liam, you wanted to have a cool little announcement.

204
00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:04.510
LIAM: Oh man, we have got a little treatsie for you tonight.

205
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.240
Since we are rolling into this game at level 10,

206
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.750
we thought it was the perfect time

207
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.935
to unveil our new character art

208
00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:15.815
by artist Ariana Orner, @ornerine.

209
00:08:15.815 --> 00:08:18.320
She did the first batch of official art for this campaign.

210
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.800
She's doing this one, she's doing the whole campaign.

211
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.639
They are mouth watering, just put her on the fucking screen.

212
00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:23.964
MARISHA: Cooler clothes!

213
00:08:25.868 --> 00:08:27.833
ALL: Whoa!

214
00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:30.458
MARISHA: Look at how dope we are!

215
00:08:30.458 --> 00:08:31.650
LAURA: Look how tall you are, Caduceus.

216
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.395
TALIESIN: I'm very tall.

217
00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:35.740
He's a tall, tall guy, well, to be fair.

218
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.330
ALL: Yeah.

219
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.128
LIAM: Look at those fucking abs on Beauregard!

220
00:08:40.128 --> 00:08:41.949
TALIESIN: Look at that purloined coat.

221
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:42.930
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

222
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.895
LIAM: Look at that anxiety-whited hair on Fjord.

223
00:08:45.895 --> 00:08:46.890
SAM: Look at that sword.

224
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.220
TALIESIN: Oh, that sword is so nice.

225
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.560
LIAM: David Bowie Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yep, yep.

226
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.130
LIAM: Yasha metal.

227
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.700
Jester bluebells.

228
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.230
LAURA: Look at the beading on her coat,

229
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.150
you guys, it is so pretty.

230
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.310
LIAM: Can we get a zoom in on Nott's face?

231
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.000
Man, look at those eyes.

232
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.890
TALIESIN: Let's talk about the button necklace.

233
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.692
SAM: The button necklace is pretty great.

234
00:09:04.692 --> 00:09:05.970
TALIESIN: The button necklace is amazing.

235
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.430
TRAVIS: The details are so amazing.

236
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.710
LIAM: As we've seen in game,

237
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.280
that goblin will straight up kill you.

238
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.880
MARISHA: Yeah, that quilted jacket.

239
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.120
I want that in real life.

240
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.151
LAURA: Nott's embracing her sexy.

241
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:19.500
LIAM: The yellow is great.

242
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.830
SAM: Keep scanning around.

243
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.630
Let's see some other people details.

244
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.530
Wow.

245
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.940
LIAM: You got hacked.

246
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.100
LAURA: You got sliced.

247
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.075
SAM: DDoS.

248
00:09:29.075 --> 00:09:30.208
Right?

249
00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:31.930
Denial of service.

250
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.720
TALIESIN: You're un-jacked.
SAM: I'm un-jacked.

251
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.390
LIAM: By the way, if anyone wants to see this art

252
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.710
in full, individual portraits, you can go over

253
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.250
to critrole.come right now, it's there now.

254
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.910
MATT: Yeah, all those awesome Xhorhasian outfits

255
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.340
you guys had made while you were in Rosohna, I love it.

256
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.410
LIAM: Ariana killed it, thank you, Ariana.

257
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.608
MATT: Thank you, Ariana.

258
00:09:52.608 --> 00:09:54.240
TRAVIS: So much.

259
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.723
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

260
00:09:55.723 --> 00:09:58.220
MATT: Without further ado, let's go ahead

261
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.271

LAURA: What?

288
00:11:43.525 --> 00:11:45.220
MATT: I don't know what that was, but sure.

289
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.230
TALIESIN: Panic.

290
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.950
MATT: Last we left off, the Mighty Nein

291
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.410
had made their way northward to the Greying Wildlands,

292
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.920
had made contact with the keepers of the Cinderrest Sanctum,

293
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.110
the Burning Lodge where the Dust family

294
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.440
with the connection to the Clay family

295
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.066
was brought with an interesting challenge

296
00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:09.890
of the Clay family trying to bring some of these visions

297
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.879
to bear in some way to protect their home grove.

298
00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:15.730
ALL: Oh.

299
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.380
SAM: There's an audio glitch tonight.

300
00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.652
MATT: Got you.
SAM: I hacked it.

301
00:12:20.652 --> 00:12:22.203
MATT: Goddamn it.

302
00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.210
You managed to acquire some of this refined residuum

303
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.540
and processed it as per this vision in the Underforge

304
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.500
and in doing so, completed one aspect of this vision.

305
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.970
You also made friends with Reani, an amazing

306
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.010
aasimar druid who was living in Uthodurn

307
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:48.100
and aided you towards the cavern lair

308
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.490
of an ancient white dragon where you enchanted

309
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.240
mithral to iceflex and returned to have

310
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.143
two halves of a long, shattered magical sword reforged.

311
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.170
Now, at the hands of Fjord,

312
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.840
who had tossed his previous blade

313
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.750
and his pact with Uk'otoa into the flames

314
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.660
and spent a period of time

315
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.570
powerless and in search for direction,

316
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:16.890
accepted a charge from the Wildmother herself

317
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.940
and begins his first day

318
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.430
on the path of a paladin.

319
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.263
So,

320
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.880
as we pick up here,

321
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.580
you guys have said your goodbyes to Reani,

322
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.640
who has returned to Uthodurn to

323
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.190
hopefully

324
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.050
take on some of that contract that she had agreed to,

325
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.870
to aid you guys in configuring

326
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.410
your Circle of Teleportation to Uthodurn

327
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.160
and it seemed like she was interested in

328
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.160
going into some adventure and some bad insanity anyway.

329
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.260
Says her goodbyes.

330
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.948
It's now midday or so,

331
00:13:51.948 --> 00:13:55.400
you guys are at the Cinderrest Sanctum.

332
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.630
It's warm and it's sweaty on the inside.

333
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.280
It is cold after a fresh snow on the outside.

334
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.013
What would you like to do?

335
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.200
SAM: What do we do?
LAURA: What are we doing

336
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.260
now that we have this sword?

337
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.500
MARISHA: Yeah, we found the forge.

338
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.670
SAM: Did you do the thing
that you needed to do, Mr. Caduceus?

339
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.440
TALIESIN: I'm having a dice attack.

340
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.910
I've started what I need to do.

341
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.901
TRAVIS: I want to thank you all,

342
00:14:22.901 --> 00:14:24.784
I'll be leaving now, thank you.

343
00:14:24.784 --> 00:14:27.280
Goodbye, it was lovely knowing you all.

344
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.520
Appreciate it.

345
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.020
SAM: You can't leave.

346
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.677
TALIESIN: Roll for initiative.

347
00:14:31.677 --> 00:14:32.760
(laughter)

348
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.320
TALIESIN: Take his stuff!
TRAVIS: Fools!

349
00:14:39.595 --> 00:14:42.530
LIAM: Well, Caduceus, is there a next step

350
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.450
in what you wish to get accomplished?

351
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.290
I will need to return to Rosohna for a short spell, but--

352
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.830
TALIESIN: I think we should gather and regroup and

353
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.955
I definitely have some next steps that I have to take.

354
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.760
Let's figure out where we all are first and maybe

355
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.234
have a moment of celebration.

356
00:15:06.234 --> 00:15:08.165
This is about you right now.

357
00:15:09.317 --> 00:15:12.460
TRAVIS: I'm so thankful, this is

358
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.601
incredible.

359
00:15:15.076 --> 00:15:17.120
It's more than I could have expected.

360
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.330
It's a beautiful sword.

361
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.630
Truly.

362
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.208
SAM: What did you do to deserve it?

363
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.520
TRAVIS: Nothing. (stammers)

364
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.480
LAURA: Everything.

365
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.410
TRAVIS: Well, Caduceus gave it to me.

366
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.743
LAURA: Fjord is very noble

367
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.500
and he turned down ultimate power

368
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.680
so that he could be a better person.

369
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.450
SAM: Wow, that's pretty bold.

370
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.360
TRAVIS: Well, some, some power.

371
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.250
LAURA: Like it would have been, he could have controlled

372
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.990
the seas basically and he said "No, I don't want to do that.

373
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:53.820
"I'm going to say no and I'm going to

374
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.490
"be just a normal person."

375
00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.665
And we rewarded that with his, um,

376
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.346
sword.

377
00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.170
SAM: Why'd you say it like that?

378
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.765
LAURA: I don't know.

379
00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:09.015
(laughter)

380
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.321
SAM: I mean, it sounds like

381
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:18.579
you did a lot to deserve it, then.

382
00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:21.470
TRAVIS: I won't lie, it feels good to have

383
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.420
this back and to not weigh you all down.

384
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.790
I know you said that I didn't, but it means a lot.

385
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.740
SAM: I mean, it seems right that you would

386
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.790
give back all of our stuff now though, right?

387
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.060
I mean the stuff that we loaned you?

388
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.460
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, of course, there were so many.

389
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.560
I have the glove and I have the dagger, of course.

390
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.010
And the whip.

391
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:46.940
Did you want the whip?

392
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.380
LAURA: You're so strong now, though.

393
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.340
I feel like the whip is really appropriate for you.

394
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.520
MARISHA: Yeah, you do feel like,

395
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.620
are you like an endomorph?

396
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.990
You just like stack on some muscle--

397
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.550
TRAVIS: I got a little swole, yeah.

398
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.478
MARISHA: Yeah, but it was like two workouts.

399
00:17:02.478 --> 00:17:05.255
TRAVIS: I slept like nine hours last night, it was amazing.

400
00:17:05.255 --> 00:17:07.820
LAURA: That seaweed wrap, man, it'll get you.

401
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.150
MARISHA: Maybe I should start eating better.

402
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.441
LAURA: Potentially.

403
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.810
TRAVIS: Yes, but those push-ups

404
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.377
and sit-ups I'm sure helped as well.

405
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.790
MARISHA: I feel called out.

406
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.720
LAURA: You're still very swole.

407
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.760
MARISHA: Thank you.
LAURA: But you always were.

408
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.593
MARISHA: Thank you.

409
00:17:23.593 --> 00:17:26.650
TRAVIS: The Glove of Blasting, would you like it back?

410
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.433
LIAM: Oh. No.

411
00:17:28.433 --> 00:17:30.440
You hold onto that.

412
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.100
TRAVIS: Thank you.
LIAM: Yeah.

413
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.250
TRAVIS: Would you like the dagger

414
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.670
for its lock-closing abilities?

415
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.550
SAM: If you don't want it, I wouldn't say no.

416
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.950
You know, whatever you need.

417
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:46.536
I mean, I don't want to upset a holy man.

418
00:17:46.536 --> 00:17:50.552
TRAVIS: Hah! Uh. (clears throat)

419
00:17:50.552 --> 00:17:52.955
Nott, I don't know if I'm holy.

420
00:17:52.955 --> 00:17:57.430
I'm just committed to affecting good, positive change.

421
00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.150
SAM: Does this mean you can't have sex ever again?

422
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.200
TRAVIS: I did not read that in any

423
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.760
bylines of any dream that I had.

424
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.840
SAM: Is that how it works?

425
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.760
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure that's not how that works, no.

426
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.660
SAM: I think it is, I've read about holy people

427
00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.990
and I think you have to take a vow of chastity

428
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.967
and a vow of silence.

429
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.123
TRAVIS: Is that right?

430
00:18:18.123 --> 00:18:19.010
SAM: That's what I read.

431
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.790
LAURA: This is why you should've followed the Traveler.

432
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.960
TRAVIS: No sex and shut up.

433
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.410
SAM: You can't talk or have sex.

434
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.600
Which weirdly, if you don't talk,

435
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.030
it makes sex even better.

436
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.873
It's like cool and mysterious.
LAURA: This is not what I've heard.

437
00:18:31.873 --> 00:18:34.070
TRAVIS: I don't want to upset the Wildmother, so--

438
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.270
LIAM: Those two things aside, do you plan

439
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:41.411
to go about your business in a different way now somehow?

440
00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:42.760
TRAVIS: Mm.

441
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.235
LIAM: Too soon to tell.
SAM: Vow of silence.

442
00:18:47.434 --> 00:18:48.267
TRAVIS: Mm.

443
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.937
LIAM: All right.
TALIESIN: This is going to be--

444
00:18:51.937 --> 00:18:53.053
Yeah.
MARISHA: This is weird.

445
00:18:53.053 --> 00:18:54.710
SAM: For the next 60 episodes.

446
00:18:57.607 --> 00:19:00.157
Oh no, he's a mime!

447
00:19:00.157 --> 00:19:01.540
(laughter)

448
00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.103
He's a mime-lock.

449
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.960
LIAM: Yeah, but now try that with your

450
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.424
original accent that you introduced us.

451
00:19:08.424 --> 00:19:11.400
TRAVIS: (grunting)

452
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.874
♪ (Grunting) ♪

453
00:19:12.874 --> 00:19:14.140
SAM: It's Slingblade!

454
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.602
LIAM: Very good with accents.

455
00:19:19.236 --> 00:19:21.570
TRAVIS: Perhaps not the silence part, though.

456
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.590
MARISHA: You shouldn't go without the sex part, either.

457
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.520
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

458
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.820
MARISHA: Because like that's stupid.

459
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.620
TALIESIN: Perhaps we make our way home or at the very least,

460
00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.070
do we have any further research

461
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.310
to do on the King Who Crawls?

462
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.990
The creatures that we're going to be meeting?

463
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.630
It's hard to concentrate with this thing.

464
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.355
MARISHA: Fucking fly!
TALIESIN: It's really driving me insane.

465
00:19:44.355 --> 00:19:46.380
LAURA: Where did that even come from?

466
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.480
TRAVIS: Don't ask questions.

467
00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:50.480
SAM: It came from the Wildmother.

468
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.900
LAURA: Oh my god, if you can get it--

469
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.559
LIAM: Hexblade Warlock.
TRAVIS: It'll be great.

470
00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:54.642
(electric shocks)

471
00:19:54.642 --> 00:19:56.120
ALL: Whoa.

472
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.090
SAM: Did that hurt?
LAURA: Oh, shit!

473
00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.998
TRAVIS: Not a paladin.

474
00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:02.248
(laughter)

475
00:20:06.062 --> 00:20:07.070
LAURA: Ow.

476
00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.640
TALIESIN: How hard would it be to return home at this point?

477
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.820
LIAM: Not hard at all.

478
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.270
TALIESIN: Do we continue up here in?

479
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.920
LAURA: Like home, home?
TALIESIN: Well--

480
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.753
LIAM: Yeah, which home,

481
00:20:18.753 --> 00:20:22.020
do you mean Rosohna or to the Xhorhaus?

482
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.354
I can take us there, Jester.

483
00:20:25.354 --> 00:20:26.604
Oh dear.

484
00:20:27.462 --> 00:20:29.502
TALIESIN: We will be able to concentrate again someday.

485
00:20:29.502 --> 00:20:31.560
LIAM: Perhaps maybe you could message ahead this time.

486
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.876
I need to

487
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.400
visit that prison again.

488
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.580
SAM: Oh, yes.

489
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.720
LAURA: Okay.

490
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.640
LIAM: A couple of days maybe, at the most.

491
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.360
LAURA: Do you want me to,

492
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.650
okay, yes.

493
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.200
LIAM: Yeah, we just need to alert them

494
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.500
at that library that we plan to come.

495
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.920
LAURA: Oh yes, I can send a message to the library.

496
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.277
MARISHA: What are you planning to get out of that woman

497
00:20:56.277 --> 00:20:57.793
that you haven't already?

498
00:20:58.737 --> 00:21:01.770
LIAM: I didn't get anything out of that woman already.

499
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.218
TALIESIN: There was a time element to that, though,

500
00:21:06.218 --> 00:21:08.010
was there not?

501
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.070
LIAM: I

502
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.230
was not

503
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.488
prepared

504
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.880
to run into my past, perhaps.

505
00:21:20.938 --> 00:21:23.349
I think that I need to--

506
00:21:23.349 --> 00:21:27.120
(soft flute music)

507
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.120
That's behind me and I have not walked

508
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.190
as far as that woman has and I think

509
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.987
I want to try to understand

510
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.300
her better.

511
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.510
MARISHA: All right.

512
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.152
LIAM: She's going to die.

513
00:21:44.009 --> 00:21:45.384
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

514
00:21:45.384 --> 00:21:47.765
LIAM: I will watch it if they will permit me.

515
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.823
LAURA: Why?

516
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.140
LIAM: She deserves it.

517
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.978
LAURA: She deserves, like how do you mean she deserves it?

518
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:14.429
LIAM: I assume she has not had much empathy offered to her.

519
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.762
And thus, she offers no empathy, nor will she anymore, but

520
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.230
things maybe would be better for me if there

521
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.738
had been a little more empathy and there was not.

522
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.682
LAURA: But there is now.

523
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.450
MARISHA: This isn't some sort of, like, weird,

524
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:45.213
masochistic self-projection type of thing, is it?

525
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.686
LIAM: Oh, why not both?

526
00:22:48.686 --> 00:22:51.490
(chuckles)

527
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:56.486
LAURA: Should I send a message to Scribewarden Uvesic

528
00:22:56.486 --> 00:22:58.820
then right now?

529
00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.360
Are we going like now?

530
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.450
LIAM: Does anyone have anything

531
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.890
they wish to wrap up here before we go?

532
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.870
Caduceus.

533
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.300
TALIESIN: I've taken care of everything I need here.

534
00:23:10.523 --> 00:23:11.703
I believe.

535
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.660
The next part of what I need to do isn't here, if I recall.

536
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.611
MATT: No, you were given visions of

537
00:23:20.611 --> 00:23:22.069
a jungle oasis.

538
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.680
SAM: Then let's go, oh wait.

539
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.605
We're going back to Rosahna, Rosohna, Rosahna.

540
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.730
Yeah, that's right.

541
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.840
I was just making sure.

542
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.200
There was some other things

543
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.690
that we learned recently last night.

544
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.800
The Jagendoths, the Jagendohths.

545
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.784
MARISHA: The Jagentoths who funded--
SAM: But that's not around here.

546
00:23:48.784 --> 00:23:50.460
MARISHA: -- The Iron Shepherds.

547
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.410
Well,

548
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.468
kind of, hang on.

549
00:23:54.468 --> 00:23:56.280
TRAVIS: They were around the ruins of--

550
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.400
TALIESIN: Little catch-up.

551
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.125
MARISHA: It was that--

552
00:24:00.485 --> 00:24:03.813
the people from Reani's past.

553
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.510
She also had dealings and were searching

554
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.450
for the Jagentoths as well, if I'm remembering correctly.

555
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.960
MATT: She's had negative experiences with the Jagentoths

556
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.670
in the past and there was a connection that was made.

557
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.670
SAM: We had a letter, we found a letter, right?

558
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.503
MATT: Correct.

559
00:24:21.758 --> 00:24:22.749
MATT: The Tumblecarve residence

560
00:24:22.749 --> 00:24:24.130
seemed to connect their business.

561
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.560
MARISHA: That's right, Tumblecartes.

562
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.643
Tumblecarves.

563
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.480
MATT: The Jagentoths were based in Shadycreek Run.

564
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.230
MARISHA: Yeah, and dealt in the slave trade.

565
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.140
SAM: That's not pressing to us right now.

566
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.070
We have to figure out what the Laughing Hand's doing.

567
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.520
Get back to business, real business.

568
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.950
MARISHA: Unfortunately, there are thugs

569
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.970
and shitty people all over the world.

570
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.800
LAURA: And Traveler-Con is coming up.

571
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.440
MARISHA: Yeah, when is Traveler-Con?
LIAM: How far off is that, yeah?

572
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.056
LAURA: It's, um--

573
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.990
pretty, kind of soon.

574
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.100
MATT: It's roughly seven to eight weeks.

575
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.420
LAURA: Seven to eight weeks?!

576
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.490
MATT: If I recall correctly.

577
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.510
MARISHA: We've got to start building our costumes.

578
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.890
LAURA: I know, there's like a lot of crap that goes in.

579
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.890
I need to talk to the Traveler a lot about it.

580
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:10.870
You all want to come?

581
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.210
It's going to be super fun.

582
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.230
TALIESIN: I think I'd definitely have to say yes.

583
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.650
SAM: I've never cosplayed before.

584
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.690
LAURA: You'll be really good.

585
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:23.320
I can make us all Traveler outfits and stuff.

586
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.153
SAM: Ooh, great.

587
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.720
TRAVIS: Do we need to check in with the Bright Queen at all?

588
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.637
TALIESIN: Yes, that would be a smart thing to do, I think.

589
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.230
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send a message then, okay?

590
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:36.063
SAM: Okay.

591
00:25:36.063 --> 00:25:39.040
LAURA: All right, I'm going to send a message

592
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.910
to Scribewarden Uvesic.

593
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.795
MATT: Scribewarden Uvesic at, within the--

594
00:25:45.795 --> 00:25:47.850
LIAM: Steeple.

595
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.370
LAURA: So that they know we're coming.

596
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.426
Right? That's what you want us to do?

597
00:25:51.426 --> 00:25:53.850
LIAM: So we don't blow up their shit
like we did that last time.

598
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.683
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

599
00:25:54.683 --> 00:25:56.450
MATT: You guys are going to Uthodurn first?

600
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.103
SAM: No.
MARISHA: Rosohna.

601
00:26:00.103 --> 00:26:00.950
SAM: No, we're going to Xhorhas.

602
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.100
MATT: The Scribewarden is in Uthodurn.

603
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.650
LAURA: I'm glad that you asked that.

604
00:26:06.747 --> 00:26:09.160
MATT: I know it's been a couple of weeks.

605
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.990
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to send a message to Essek

606
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.055
and let him know that we're coming to the palace.

607
00:26:14.055 --> 00:26:15.332
SAM: Yeah.

608
00:26:15.332 --> 00:26:17.023
LAURA: Yeah? Or does it matter?

609
00:26:17.023 --> 00:26:18.550
Because we can just show up there.

610
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.840
MARISHA: Yeah, we can just show up, right?

611
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.450
TALIESIN: What's the easiest travel?

612
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.410
LIAM: Let's, as an act of good faith,

613
00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.210
let's Essek know that we are coming.

614
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.360
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send a message to Essek.

615
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.860
LIAM: Yes, please.

616
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.490
LAURA: Hi Essek.

617
00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.060
We're wrapping it up up here.

618
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.040
On our way back to the palace.

619
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.120
Just wanted to give you

620
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.593
a heads up because we are very polite.

621
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:52.637
MATT: "It is very good to see that

622
00:26:52.637 --> 00:26:55.592
"you survived your encounter with the dragon.

623
00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.460
"I guess we will prepare for your arrival."

624
00:27:01.974 --> 00:27:03.590
LAURA: He sounded really excited.

625
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.423
SAM: That's great.

626
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.763
TALIESIN: Who wouldn't be?

627
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:11.990
MARISHA: Okay.

628
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.200
SAM: Where do we do this?

629
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.865
LIAM: Well, we could do it here.

630
00:27:14.865 --> 00:27:16.650
Are we sure we are ready to go?

631
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:17.483
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

632
00:27:17.483 --> 00:27:18.820
LAURA: What else are we going to do?

633
00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.090
MATT: There was something you commissioned--

634
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.780
TALIESIN: I picked it up already.

635
00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.580
LAURA: I'll just make snow angels while--

636
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.930
TRAVIS: Actually, while you're preparing,

637
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.010
I wouldn't mind spending a moment with this sword.

638
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.080
I think I might be able to use it

639
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.820
in the same way I did my falchion before.

640
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.790
SAM: Great.

641
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.720
You mean like make it disappear and reappear?

642
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.195
TRAVIS: Yeah, precisely.
SAM: Cool.

643
00:27:41.195 --> 00:27:42.510
LAURA: Ooh!

644
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.080
I'm going to do snow angels and watch you concentrate.

645
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.913
TRAVIS: Okay.

646
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.710
MATT: So for an hour,

647
00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.640
you make snow angels and concentrate on Fjord

648
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.450
as you sit and center yourself, connecting

649
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.952
and extending your blade pact

650
00:27:58.952 --> 00:28:01.570
with your new weapon.

651
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.990
MARISHA: Hey Fjord, hey Fjord.

652
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.380
TRAVIS: I'm trying to really focus in on--

653
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.820
MARISHA: Okay, I'll give you a minute.

654
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.100
Let me know when you're done.

655
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.130
TRAVIS: I'm going to be here for a minute.

656
00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.960
Was there something you needed immediately?

657
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.620
MARISHA: I'm just curious, could you

658
00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.930
theoretically do this with anything?

659
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.838
Could you make anything disappear and reappear?

660
00:28:25.293 --> 00:28:26.948
With the power of your mind?

661
00:28:26.948 --> 00:28:28.048
TRAVIS: What do you mean anything?

662
00:28:28.048 --> 00:28:28.881
MARISHA: I'm just saying,

663
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:34.230
this is prime territory for some real good pranks.

664
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:39.230
Like could you bring a toilet back or away, like--

665
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.860
TRAVIS: No, no.

666
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.801
MARISHA: Say Nott is on the toilet

667
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:45.976
and then you will it away.

668
00:28:45.976 --> 00:28:47.730
What happens, can you do that?

669
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.130
TRAVIS: Nott and the toilet or just the toilet?

670
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.460
MARISHA: Can you do Nott, too?!

671
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.537
Can you do people?!

672
00:28:53.537 --> 00:28:55.110
TRAVIS: I don't think I can do either.

673
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.618
I think it's only weapons.

674
00:28:59.467 --> 00:29:00.997
MARISHA: You should try it sometime.

675
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.700
TRAVIS: All right.

676
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.308
MARISHA: I'll let you finish.

677
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.147
Just think it over.
TRAVIS: I will.

678
00:29:08.147 --> 00:29:09.372
MARISHA: Okay.

679
00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.370
TRAVIS: And I will try and push the image

680
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.240
of Nott on the toilet out of my head.

681
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.073
MATT: Okay.

682
00:29:18.073 --> 00:29:19.320
All right.

683
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.764
LIAM: Nott on the pot.
TRAVIS: (screeching)

684
00:29:21.764 --> 00:29:24.660
SAM: (screeching)

685
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.520
LIAM: Just white-knuckling a chamberpot. (screeching)

686
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.950
MATT: It's strange.

687
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.790
Whenever you've connected with a pact weapon,

688
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.440
whenever you've bonded with your blades previously,

689
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.830
it's always been like a relay.

690
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:46.830
Like you're borrowing a tether from something dark

691
00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:52.030
and cold but from below, representing Uk'otoa's gift

692
00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.900
and then using it to tether the weapon to you.

693
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.910
This, the tether comes from within.

694
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.100
It's still the same dark tether

695
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.780
that you recall in your mind's eye as you concentrate,

696
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.370
but the source is just yourself

697
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:14.370
and it's weirdly comforting to not,

698
00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:18.598
to not sense it being something so directly borrowed.

699
00:30:22.003 --> 00:30:24.830
As soon as you finish your period of concentration,

700
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.430
you feel the blade connect.

701
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.260
You can feel the cold of the iceflex

702
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.980
curl across your fingers and your skin

703
00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:36.290
numbs momentarily as you feel this blade become one with you

704
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:40.380
and whatever this dark seed you still hold within you is.

705
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.000
As you open your eyes and look at it

706
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.664
in your hands, you turn it over and

707
00:30:47.664 --> 00:30:49.960
(whoosh). You guys watch as the blade seems

708
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.800
to crumple to snow and then vanish from his hand.

709
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.855
TRAVIS: Oh, ho, ho, ho.

710
00:30:54.855 --> 00:30:56.750
MARISHA: That's so cool.

711
00:31:00.997 --> 00:31:02.450
TRAVIS: That's pretty incredible.

712
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:03.550
SAM: Can you get it back?

713
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.720
TRAVIS: It's a one time usage, that was it.

714
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.050
SAM: It seems like such a waste.
TRAVIS: I know.

715
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.610
SAM: We have to go to the dragon again.

716
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.530
TRAVIS: I'll be going now, thank you, I'll go.

717
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:18.530
Yes, I will try and re-summon the broadsword.

718
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.670
MATT: You see a flash of blue light and the blade itself

719
00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.760
just emerges out of where his open palm was.

720
00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.080
He grasps the edge and a familiar splash

721
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.720
of water shoots forth, similar to where

722
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.110
he had previously summoned his weapon.

723
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.560
Except where it lands, it's freezing cold

724
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.085
and a bit of frost is left behind.

725
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.622
LAURA: That was really cool, Fjord.

726
00:31:43.622 --> 00:31:46.200
(laughter)

727
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.970
TRAVIS: I walk over where Jester is doing snow angels

728
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:52.282
and I'll make it disappear and make it snow.

729
00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.678
Thank you, Jester.

730
00:31:57.678 --> 00:32:00.678
(light clapping)

731
00:32:00.678 --> 00:32:01.910
TALIESIN: It's the little things.

732
00:32:02.928 --> 00:32:06.230
TRAVIS: You've been more than accommodating, I'm ready now.

733
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.920
LIAM: This has mostly been finished for like 40 minutes.

734
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.490
I just need to do a couple lines, are we ready?

735
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.620
SAM: Let's do it.
LIAM: Okay.

736
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.660
Remember, quickly.

737
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.620
LAURA: Hold on, I need about 10 more minutes.

738
00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.600
SAM: Oh boy.

739
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.450
TRAVIS: How many snow angels have you made?

740
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.253
LAURA: 50.

741
00:32:20.253 --> 00:32:21.819
MARISHA: It's really pretty,

742
00:32:21.819 --> 00:32:23.270
she's making like a mandala, you see that?

743
00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:25.465
(laughter)

744
00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:26.920
MATT: At that moment, out of your

745
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.400
moment of concentration looking upon

746
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.280
the mountainside with the fresh snowfall,

747
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.910
there are dozens and dozens of Jester shapes.

748
00:32:37.991 --> 00:32:39.049
LAURA: All right, all right, all right.

749
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:40.040
You can go now, I'm done.

750
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.170
TRAVIS: What if somebody was like

751
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.915
"Oh my god, the forces on that peak."

752
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:48.670
MARISHA: It's crop circles, it's Ancient Aliens, dude.

753
00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:53.070
MATT and MARISHA: Ancient alien theorists suggest--

754
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.086
LIAM: Sword-voring.

755
00:32:55.086 --> 00:32:56.250
(laughter)

756
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.340
There is also a small, poorly drawn

757
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.913
Jester angel outside the circle because he was bored.

758
00:33:03.913 --> 00:33:06.070
(whooshes) Go, go, everybody go.

759
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.020
SAM: Go, go, go, go, go.

760
00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.870
MATT: The circle glows, you all rush inside of it.

761
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.660
Feel yourselves pulled through that familiar

762
00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.360
thrust of teleportation, dragging you into

763
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.980
the darkness and then all of you stepping out

764
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.230
beneath the Lucid Bastion in Rosohna.

765
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.850
Remember to mark off your material components for it.

766
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.900
The guards turn but now they seem to have

767
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.980
grown a little more used to your independent visages

768
00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.810
and there isn't any sort of moment of extreme tension.

769
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:32.660
They turn and then go back to their post.

770
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.550
LIAM: That change in temperature, so good.

771
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.120
SAM: Do we need to check in with anyone

772
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.960
at the palace or just go straight to the prison cell, or?

773
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.750
LIAM: Don't go straight.
MARISHA: We have been avoiding the

774
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.135
BQ.

775
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.380
TRAVIS: You've literally blocked your mouth from
everyone who can see you.

776
00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:53.883
MARISHA: Sorry.

777
00:33:53.883 --> 00:33:54.716
TRAVIS: It would serve--
MARISHA: -- the BQ.

778
00:33:54.716 --> 00:33:55.630
TRAVIS: There you go.

779
00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.233
SAM: The Bright, the Bright Queen.

780
00:33:57.233 --> 00:33:58.686
LIAM: BQ.

781
00:33:58.686 --> 00:33:59.905
MARISHA: BQ.

782
00:33:59.905 --> 00:34:01.140
(laughter)

783
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.000
SAM: Should we go see her BQ-ness?

784
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.233
LAURA: If she'll see us.

785
00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:08.599
I mean, we can't just walk in on her.

786
00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:11.080
She's really important.
LIAM: Yeah, we have to make a request.

787
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.890
SAM: But do we have anything to report?

788
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:14.360
We haven't done anything towards our--

789
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.193
LIAM: Yeah, I don't think that

790
00:34:15.193 --> 00:34:16.740
we should bother her straightaway.

791
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.150
I think that we should talk to Essek.

792
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.870
I need to make my request.

793
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:21.780
I've already been told it would

794
00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.900
be all right, but I don't know the timing.

795
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:24.990
TALIESIN: It's possible to see if there's

796
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:27.732
been any sightings of the creature.

797
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:30.950
SAM: Essek would know.
TALIESIN: Yes.

798
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:34.570
LIAM: Are we making ourselves more readily--

799
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.080
oh, that looks good.
LAURA: Yes.

800
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.550
LIAM: Readily available to the Queen?

801
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.930
TALIESIN: For the moment, maybe, now that we're--

802
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:43.070
TRAVIS: Yeah.

803
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.000
TALIESIN: Well, we've--
TRAVIS: Certainly.

804
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.548
TALIESIN: Now that we're all--

805
00:34:47.548 --> 00:34:50.990
LIAM: Off as long as maybe we can without putting in

806
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.970
a little bit of hard work and elbow grease in.

807
00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:56.790
MARISHA: We were a bit vague about
the whole Laughing Hand thing.

808
00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:01.210
We were just like "Oh, handling it, ha ha ha."

809
00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:02.990
TALIESIN: Doing research, amassing power.

810
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:04.700
These are the appropriate things to do

811
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.890
when facing a difficult obstacle.

812
00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:09.380
LIAM: I think probably

813
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.150
we should check in with our housekeeping.

814
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.983
TALIESIN: Yeah.

815
00:35:13.983 --> 00:35:16.717
LIAM: And talk about next steps.

816
00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.970
MARISHA: They did want me to consider
going back to the Empire.

817
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:23.930
SAM: Who is they?

818
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.438
MARISHA: Dairon.
SAM: Oh.

819
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:28.685
To do a mission?

820
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.080
LIAM: Why don't we wait 'til later to talk about that?

821
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.592
MARISHA: These walls definitely have ears.

822
00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.490
SAM: For right now, we're just going to find Essek.

823
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.257
Do you know where he was going to meet us?

824
00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.080
LAURA: Nope.

825
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.460
SAM: Well then, I guess we'll just go home,

826
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.155
assume that he'll meet us there?

827
00:35:49.155 --> 00:35:50.263
TALIESIN: That's fair.

828
00:35:50.263 --> 00:35:51.820
LIAM: Let's just head there for now.

829
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.970
SAM: To the Xhorhaus.

830
00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:55.420
MATT: All right.

831
00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.350
You guys make your way through the Lucid Bastion

832
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.070
and then follow on to the neighborhood

833
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.410
where the Xhorhaus awaits you.

834
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.622
Walking through the neighborhood,

835
00:36:04.622 --> 00:36:06.910
you're catching a few stares, but once again,

836
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.830
you've established yourself with the neighbors at least.

837
00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.750
So people still turn,

838
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.410
a motley crew in the capital of the Dynasty.

839
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.180
You do look and see the familiar glow

840
00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:23.100
of the gargantuan tree that marks your arrival

841
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.435
upon the exterior of your abode.

842
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.460
Entering the house,

843
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.538
it's quiet and still.

844
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.040
SAM: No one's there to greet us at the door?

845
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:39.770
MATT: Not if-- you have a means of entering the house.

846
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.020
Would you prefer to not, or do you wish to just enter?

847
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.320
SAM: Oh, no, we'll just enter.

848
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:48.620
MATT: You walk into the home to silence.

849
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.170
MARISHA: Dairon?
SAM: But Dairon's not around?

850
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.140
Dairon!
LAURA: Hello?

851
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.590
TRAVIS: Or whatever name

852
00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.798
they have.

853
00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.640
SAM: No answer? I turn invisible and walk upstairs.

854
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.557
MATT: Okay.

855
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.170
MARISHA: I look around. Does anything look disturbed?

856
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.120
Does it look like, anything out of place

857
00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.890
from where we left it last, any signs of?

858
00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:12.906
MATT: Make a perception check,

859
00:37:12.906 --> 00:37:16.450
or this'll be investigation for this one.

860
00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:17.283
One or the other.

861
00:37:17.283 --> 00:37:18.763
MARISHA: Why, why?

862
00:37:18.763 --> 00:37:21.780
Every freaking time with all these checks.

863
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.714
MATT: Stealth check with advantage.
MARISHA: Nine.

864
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.040
MATT: It's hard to tell.

865
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.298
It's been awhile since you've been here and you haven't

866
00:37:27.298 --> 00:37:29.422
spent enough time to have a strong--
MARISHA and TRAVIS: ♪ It's been awhile! ♪

867
00:37:29.422 --> 00:37:31.813
MATT: I knew it was coming. A strong enough memory

868
00:37:31.813 --> 00:37:33.160
of the placement of things in this house

869
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.660
with the limited time you've spent here

870
00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.290
to be able to corroborate if anything's been shifted.

871
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.040
LIAM: Well--
MARISHA: This doesn't feel right.

872
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.060
LIAM: I can look around.

873
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.464
SAM: 31 on stealth and I'm just walking around the upstairs.

874
00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:47.527
LIAM: With the Keen Mind feat,

875
00:37:47.527 --> 00:37:49.828
am I able to tell if anything is amiss?

876
00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.800
MATT: A few pieces of furniture, like chairs

877
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.850
have shifted slightly, but then been replaced.

878
00:37:58.694 --> 00:37:59.527
LIAM: I would also like to check my room

879
00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:01.560
and make sure that everything is exactly as I left it.

880
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.200
MATT: Everything is your room is exactly as you've left it.

881
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.950
As you un-stealthily step upstairs,

882
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:08.060
or wherever your room is.
SAM: Downstairs.

883
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.380
MATT: Downstairs I think is your room.

884
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.460
SAM: He's the only one.
MATT: Correct.

885
00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.470
TALIESIN: I'm heading upstairs.
MATT: Okay.

886
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.290
LAURA: I'm going to look in the kitchen.

887
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:15.160
MATT: Okay.

888
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.480
MARISHA: I'll look-- we have a basement, right?

889
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.657
MATT: You do. Well no, you don't have a basement.

890
00:38:20.657 --> 00:38:22.265
You have a hot tub in your tower.

891
00:38:22.265 --> 00:38:24.049
MARISHA: I'll look in the hot tub.

892
00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.710
MATT: It's filled with liquid.
MARISHA: Fuck.

893
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:29.590
MATT: Clear, clear liquid.

894
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.830
It's water!

895
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.753
LIAM: Seemingly.

896
00:38:32.753 --> 00:38:35.268
MARISHA: I just panic and get in.

897
00:38:35.268 --> 00:38:36.319
TALIESIN: You're having a panic soak.

898
00:38:36.319 --> 00:38:37.494
MATT: It appears to be water.
MARISHA: I'm having a panic soak.

899
00:38:37.494 --> 00:38:38.727
Leave me alone.

900
00:38:39.572 --> 00:38:41.770
LIAM: He's going to Wil Wheaton me in that hot tub.

901
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.020
(giggling)

902
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.754
SAM: Anything upstairs?
MATT: No.

903
00:38:47.754 --> 00:38:49.257
The house appears to be empty.

904
00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:55.370
LAURA: Well, man, I wonder where our housekeeper is?

905
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.300
MARISHA: Maybe she's just out--

906
00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.560
LIAM: Yeah, should we just have--
MARISHA: On a mission.

907
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.037
LIAM: Dinner for now and maybe she will come home?

908
00:39:04.037 --> 00:39:06.840
LAURA: In the kitchen, does it look like food

909
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.130
was recently bought and stored or does it look like?

910
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.590
MATT: Make an investigation check.

911
00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.213
TALIESIN: This cigar burning on the--

912
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:21.450
LAURA: 10.

913
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:22.790
MATT: It's hard to tell.

914
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.960
LAURA: It's hard to tell, I'm an expert at food.

915
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.920
SAM: She's a good housekeeper, then.

916
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.236
MARISHA: Let's wait a little while longer.

917
00:39:28.236 --> 00:39:30.900
If we don't hear from her, maybe we can send her a message.

918
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.728
LIAM: Yeah.

919
00:39:32.728 --> 00:39:33.790
LAURA: Okay.

920
00:39:35.071 --> 00:39:38.270
I can send her a message now if you want.

921
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.430
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

922
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.800
LAURA: I'm going to send her a message.

923
00:39:44.017 --> 00:39:45.705
Hey yo, is everything okay?

924
00:39:45.705 --> 00:39:47.380
We're back at the house.

925
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.447
Just wondering where you are.

926
00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.995
Let me know, we're all curious.

927
00:39:55.278 --> 00:39:56.564
MARISHA: Yeah.

928
00:39:56.564 --> 00:39:58.370
LAURA: Doo doo, doo doo, hmm, hmm.

929
00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:00.314
Donuts!

930
00:40:00.314 --> 00:40:02.564
(laughter)

931
00:40:04.105 --> 00:40:07.410
MATT: You have too much power with this spell.

932
00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:11.540
SAM: It's the last six words that are always the thing.

933
00:40:12.986 --> 00:40:14.836
TRAVIS: "Doo doo doo, donuts."

934
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.450
TALIESIN: It's how people know it's really us, to be fair.

935
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:23.004
MATT: Jester scats her way through the final phrases.

936
00:40:23.004 --> 00:40:23.837
SAM: ♪ Da ba, doo, ba doo ♪

937
00:40:23.837 --> 00:40:26.987
TRAVIS: That was on a billboard in the 50s somewhere.

938
00:40:26.987 --> 00:40:30.362
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo, donuts ♪

939
00:40:30.362 --> 00:40:32.244
MATT: Oh no. Okay.

940
00:40:34.502 --> 00:40:36.835
The only response you get is

941
00:40:37.718 --> 00:40:39.429
(exhale)

942
00:40:39.429 --> 00:40:40.670
"Wait."

943
00:40:41.667 --> 00:40:42.500
LAURA: Oh no.

944
00:40:43.655 --> 00:40:45.322
LIAM: "Oh no," what?

945
00:40:46.268 --> 00:40:48.185
LAURA: I'm waiting, hold on.

946
00:40:50.377 --> 00:40:51.429
MATT: Nothing else.

947
00:40:51.429 --> 00:40:54.150
LAURA: I think maybe she meant wait longer.

948
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.330
She said, "Wait," and she sounded whispery

949
00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.120
and she made like a (faint groan) noise beforehand,

950
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.550
like I couldn't tell if it was like a struggly

951
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:06.090
sort of sound or if like she was annoyed with me.

952
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.207
LIAM: I don't think she's on a shopping run.

953
00:41:09.207 --> 00:41:10.680
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

954
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.513
Okay.

955
00:41:11.513 --> 00:41:12.630
LAURA: Maybe she's pooping.

956
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.410
TRAVIS: Does anyone feel like there's something off here?

957
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.420
MARISHA: She must just be in the middle

958
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.895
of something, someplace she can't talk.

959
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:24.590
Okay, well, we'll wait.

960
00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.780
TRAVIS: Can I use--
SAM: Where's Dairon's--

961
00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.328
TRAVIS: Can I use Divine Sense?

962
00:41:29.328 --> 00:41:30.980
MATT: Sure.
SAM: Using it early.

963
00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.330
MARISHA: Getting that paladin itch.

964
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:33.200
TRAVIS: Why not, right?

965
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.460
Just to see if there's any celestial,

966
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.600
fiend, or undead within 60 feet.

967
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.330
MATT: Okay, as you concentrate, closing your eyes,

968
00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.570
just extending to sense if

969
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.800
anything considered uncouth in the eyes

970
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.077
of the Wildmother is in the proximity, nothing.

971
00:41:49.077 --> 00:41:51.140
TRAVIS: What I thought.

972
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.740
SAM: I don't know where Dairon was sleeping,

973
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:59.740
but can I go sort of investigate around their bunk or stuff?

974
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.340
MATT: Sure, you spend some time and then you hear a sound

975
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.725
on the balcony.

976
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.560
SAM: I'll run over there.
MATT: Okay.

977
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.630
Coming through the balcony entrance,

978
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.620
you can see Dairon in drow attire.

979
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.450
"Hello."

980
00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:23.283
SAM: Hi.

981
00:42:24.892 --> 00:42:26.059
Are you okay?

982
00:42:26.059 --> 00:42:28.430
MATT: "I am fine, thank you,"

983
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:31.270
and then steps past you and begins to head downstairs.

984
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:32.540
SAM: Dairon's home.

985
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.440
MARISHA: Huh?
SAM: Dairon's home.

986
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.780
MARISHA: Oh shit, I wasn't waiting at all.

987
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.731
MATT: Dairon continues downstairs.
TRAVIS: You were in the hot tub.

988
00:42:39.731 --> 00:42:41.981
(laughter)

989
00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.680
Was that the stairs, you slipped down the stairs?

990
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.180
MATT: The monk skills coming to use.

991
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.550
TRAVIS: You run up trees and you slipped

992
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:54.640
on the fucking stairs out of the hot tub?

993
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.720
LIAM: I saw my whole life flash

994
00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.790
before my eyes as those elbows flew.

995
00:42:59.547 --> 00:43:03.594
I saw myself at five, 10, it was good.

996
00:43:03.594 --> 00:43:05.290
TRAVIS: (thudding)

997
00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:06.123
MATT: You get this once a week,

998
00:43:06.123 --> 00:43:07.539
I get it the rest of the week.

999
00:43:10.531 --> 00:43:11.870
It's worth it.
MARISHA: You're fine.

1000
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:13.783
MATT: Yeah.

1001
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.450
As you gather and Dairon steps in,

1002
00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.820
you can see her a little out of breath.

1003
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.683
"I am sorry, I was in the middle of some reconnaissance.

1004
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.042
"So how go your travels?"

1005
00:43:30.042 --> 00:43:33.438
MARISHA: It's fucking nuts. We tricked a white dragon.

1006
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:40.080
We found a cool volcano lava forge.

1007
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.300
He's a paladin now.

1008
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.400
LIAM: Show them the sword.

1009
00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.250
TRAVIS: Oh.

1010
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:49.030
Yes, we've acquired some new toys.

1011
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.297
I'll summon the broadsword.

1012
00:43:52.834 --> 00:43:54.820
It's a powerful weapon.

1013
00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.630
MATT: "You are certainly full of surprises and chaotic

1014
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.370
"would be an adjective that comes to mind."

1015
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:03.511
MARISHA: We went to Uthodurn.

1016
00:44:03.511 --> 00:44:07.752
I met some other Cobalt Soul people.

1017
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.060
Oh, Archivist Demid.

1018
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:11.893
MATT: "Ah.

1019
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.993
"Yes, I'm sure he had much to talk about.

1020
00:44:15.993 --> 00:44:17.459
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

1021
00:44:17.459 --> 00:44:19.245
MATT: "A lot of lunar interests."

1022
00:44:19.245 --> 00:44:20.345
MARISHA: Yep.
MATT: "Yeah."

1023
00:44:20.345 --> 00:44:21.850
MARISHA: Yep.

1024
00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.060
So what about you?

1025
00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.820
MATT: "Well, having to play the part

1026
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.103
"of your housekeeper has been

1027
00:44:29.103 --> 00:44:31.490
"demoralizing.

1028
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:35.250
"There have been curious neighbors peeking in occasionally."

1029
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.970
SAM: Imagine how we feel not being

1030
00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:40.320
able to hire a real housekeeper.

1031
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.530
It's also demoralizing.

1032
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:43.900
MATT: "My apologies."

1033
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.091
LAURA: We're very sorry to have provided you

1034
00:44:46.091 --> 00:44:48.124
a very good cover.

1035
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.430
LIAM: It does sound like you have
extracurricular activities.

1036
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.860
Do you mind us asking what you are surveilling?

1037
00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:55.860
MATT: "No, I prefer to spend all

1038
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.360
"of my time cleaning up your household."

1039
00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.850
MARISHA: Okay, okay,

1040
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:02.990
let's all chill the fuck out just a little bit.

1041
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.370
TRAVIS: I'm actually quite calm but--

1042
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:05.270
TALIESIN: I feel fine.

1043
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:09.050
MATT: "I have been busy while you have been away,

1044
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:12.823
"doing what I do best, which is skulk and listen.

1045
00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.100
"I've been trying to get a bead on all

1046
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:20.410
"the various dens in the vicinity and pursuing

1047
00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:24.387

MATT: "This is that strange figure that you worship, yes?"

LAURA: Not strange but--

1102
00:48:18.485 --> 00:48:19.620
SAM: Eccentric.

1103
00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.430
LIAM: That's pretty accurate.

1104
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:23.040
SAM: Energetic.

1105
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.940
LAURA: Amazing, I think you mean.

1106
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.910
LIAM: Idiosyncratic.

1107
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.890
Quirky is the nice way to put it.

1108
00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:31.740
MATT: "It is an interesting cult, relatively new."

1109
00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.080
LAURA: You think we're a cult?

1110
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.730
MATT: "You tell me."

1111
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:39.090
LAURA: Well, I never thought of it that way

1112
00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:42.130
but it sounds pretty fun.
MATT: "Then a cult it is."

1113
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.870
LAURA: No, it's not a cult! It's an organized religion.

1114
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:49.320
We are very powerful and there's a lot of us followers and--

1115
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.609
oh shit, are we a cult?

1116
00:48:52.609 --> 00:48:54.437
(laughter)

1117
00:48:54.437 --> 00:48:58.240
SAM: Do you follow one sort of charismatic leader?

1118
00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.073
LAURA: Well, yeah, but--

1119
00:48:59.073 --> 00:49:01.270
SAM: Does he make you do--

1120
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.690
well, does he encourage you to do things that are

1121
00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.810
out of the ordinary and destructive to normal society?

1122
00:49:07.656 --> 00:49:08.780
LAURA: Obviously.

1123
00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:13.490
SAM: Does he encourage you to flock to him en masse,

1124
00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:16.250
sort of, and possibly worship him?

1125
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.710
LAURA: We do worship him, but it's not like

1126
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:21.470
it's just a random person doing this. He's a god.

1127
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.550
LIAM: A cult implies that it's hogwash.

1128
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.300
This is not hogwash. We have seen miracles from Jester.

1129
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.310
LAURA: Yeah, do you want to see more?

1130
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.380
SAM: Yes.

1131
00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:31.870
LAURA: Well,

1132
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.215
okay.

1133
00:49:33.215 --> 00:49:34.500
(laughter)

1134
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.908
LAURA: I'm going to use a spell right now,

1135
00:49:38.908 --> 00:49:40.766
a really cool one.

1136
00:49:40.766 --> 00:49:44.010
I'm going to use Command.

1137
00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:45.290
No.

1138
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.340
Yeah, I'm going to use Command on Nott.

1139
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.840
SAM: I will let it happen.

1140
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.140
LAURA: I'm going to say

1141
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:53.263
dance!

1142
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:56.500
SAM: I will dance.

1143
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.175
(laughter)

1144
00:49:58.175 --> 00:49:59.370
MATT: You make a saving throw or do you resist it at all?

1145
00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:01.053
SAM: No, I don't resist.

1146
00:50:01.053 --> 00:50:02.803
(laughter)

1147
00:50:04.853 --> 00:50:07.829
LAURA: See? This is the power of the Traveler.

1148
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:09.845
TRAVIS: She's really--
LAURA: We can make people happy.

1149
00:50:09.845 --> 00:50:10.830
TRAVIS: --terrible at this.
LAURA: We can make people--

1150
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:12.430
MARISHA: Awful.
LAURA: What?

1151
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:14.460
I think it's wonderful. You can stop.

1152
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:16.503
SAM: Thank you.

1153
00:50:16.503 --> 00:50:17.336
MATT: "I will be sure to take this

1154
00:50:17.336 --> 00:50:18.986
"information to the Archivists."

1155
00:50:18.986 --> 00:50:22.030
LAURA: You should; it should be archived.

1156
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:23.960
Also, we're having a big Con soon,

1157
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.930
so if you feel like joining, it's super fun.

1158
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.080
MATT: "What do you mean?"

1159
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.520
LAURA: There will be food and costumes and--

1160
00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.020
MARISHA: A convention.

1161
00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:33.480
LIAM: An event.

1162
00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.933
TRAVIS: A gathering.
LAURA: A gathering, really.

1163
00:50:36.986 --> 00:50:37.819
MARISHA: She kind of has a point

1164
00:50:37.819 --> 00:50:39.230
towards the cult thing, just throwing that out.

1165
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.223
MATT: "I would be careful."

1166
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:44.203
SAM: Why?

1167
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:46.572
MATT: "Well--"

1168
00:50:46.572 --> 00:50:47.820
TALIESIN: In general or specifically?

1169
00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.940
MATT: "Both, but in this instance,

1170
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.710
"strange new forms of worship and

1171
00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.410
"gatherings of worshipers

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:03.410
"can sometimes lead in a negative direction."

1173
00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:06.380
LAURA: Well, I mean, he's been around a really long time.

1174
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.910
So it's not like it's anything new.

1175
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:09.743
MATT: "Well."

1176
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.913
TALIESIN: I like new things, new things are nice.

1177
00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.560
LIAM: This got awkward very quickly.

1178
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.380
TRAVIS: Yes, should we find Essek and try to

1179
00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.635
follow up on those loose ends we've mentioned?

1180
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.260
LIAM: Yeah, I think we need to do a little bit

1181
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.850
of fact finding of our own before bringing

1182
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.460
you into the fold of our conversations.

1183
00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.907
Although I personally

1184
00:51:35.164 --> 00:51:37.197
would wish to soon,

1185
00:51:37.197 --> 00:51:40.180
but I feel like we should touch base

1186
00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.690
and I don't want to spook any of the people--

1187
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:44.281
MATT: "It is all right, if you require me,

1188
00:51:44.281 --> 00:51:45.372
I will be upstairs,"

1189
00:51:45.372 --> 00:51:47.280
and they turn around and head upstairs.

1190
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.162
MARISHA: I thought we were talking about-- mmkay.

1191
00:51:50.162 --> 00:51:53.370
SAM: It's all right, we need some private time anyway.

1192
00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:55.990
TALIESIN: Hard to believe the two of you were friends.

1193
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:58.560
SAM: It's always so awkward to have

1194
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.780
a personal relationship with the help, you know?

1195
00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.090
It makes things very awkward.
LAURA: Is it?

1196
00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.340
I don't know, we always were very friendly

1197
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.090
with the people helping around our place.

1198
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:08.923
SAM: That's true.

1199
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.682
LAURA: Bluud is really cool.

1200
00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.430
SAM: What is our next move?

1201
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:17.550
MARISHA: Well, we've-- okay hang on, DM question.

1202
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:18.830
MATT: Yes?
MARISHA: Stepping out of game.

1203
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:19.730
MATT: Sure.

1204
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:24.210
MARISHA: We more or less got confirmation that the

1205
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:29.460
demon holes that were splintering in from

1206
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.940
the Abyss were only happening on the Xhorhas side, right?

1207
00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.830
MATT: Actually no, you heard word that apparently

1208
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.870
similar activity seems to have been occurring--

1209
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:40.200
MARISHA: Also happening--
MATT: Somewhere in the Empire.

1210
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.730
You have only heard tidbits.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

1211
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.450
I knew we got confirmation one way or the other.

1212
00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:49.470
MATT: From Yussa while you guys were in Nicodranas.

1213
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:51.220
TALIESIN: Our two week break is our attempt

1214
00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.200
to be more like a real D&amp;D game and like--

1215
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.500
LIAM: I forgot how to be--
TALIESIN: Trying to remember--

1216
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.710
MATT: I know it's been two weeks, it's okay.

1217
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.000
TALIESIN: That weekly game is so easy to pick up.

1218
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.968
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

1219
00:53:01.968 --> 00:53:04.370
Word from Nicodranas that it was happening on both sides.

1220
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:05.950
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: Okay.

1221
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:10.140
MATT: The last you saw of the Laughing Hand,

1222
00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:13.999
Obann and Yasha was when you escaped--

1223
00:53:13.999 --> 00:53:15.310
MARISHA: The mountains.
MATT: The mountains.

1224
00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:18.430
You caught one glimpse of them via scrying,

1225
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:23.430
seemingly exiting the space outside of the King's Cage.

1226
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.560
That was the last you saw of them.

1227
00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.676
MARISHA: Okay.

1228
00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.975
SAM: So Essek's not here.

1229
00:53:32.267 --> 00:53:33.820
Do we contact Essek again?

1230
00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.290
LAURA: Or we can go to his house.

1231
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:40.940
He said he was going to prepare for us or something.

1232
00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.640
SAM: Do we know where he lives? Have we been to his house?

1233
00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.473
LAURA: Caleb does.

1234
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.983
LIAM: Did I go there?

1235
00:53:46.983 --> 00:53:48.328
TRAVIS: I don't think we've been to his--

1236
00:53:48.328 --> 00:53:49.540
MATT: I don't think you've been to his abode.

1237
00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.373
He's always come to yours.

1238
00:53:53.486 --> 00:53:55.640
TRAVIS: We should go see the Bright Queen.

1239
00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:56.890
SAM: All right.
TRAVIS: Or...

1240
00:53:59.955 --> 00:54:02.070
LIAM: I think Essek makes a better intermediary.

1241
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:04.940
I get the sense the last time we saw her that

1242
00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:08.660
we shouldn't be hitting that button willy-nilly, you know?

1243
00:54:09.587 --> 00:54:10.511
TALIESIN: You have an appointment with

1244
00:54:10.511 --> 00:54:11.778
someone you need to see.

1245
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.937
LIAM: More or less, yeah.

1246
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.820
TALIESIN: We definitely need to catch up

1247
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.370
and figure out what's happened.

1248
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.190
See if there's been any reports.

1249
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:25.023
If there's been any news.

1250
00:54:25.023 --> 00:54:27.800
Maybe take a night, meditate,

1251
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.500
think about what the next move is.

1252
00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:32.500
LIAM: Yeah, we're beating around the bush.

1253
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:37.233
Let's-- if we can just summon Essek.

1254
00:54:37.233 --> 00:54:39.590
LAURA: I'm going to try to summon him.

1255
00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:41.060
LIAM: Thank you, Jester.

1256
00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.385
LAURA: You're welcome.

1257
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:45.300
I'm going to send him another message.

1258
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.417
MATT: Okay, what message do you send?

1259
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:52.093
LAURA: So we're here.

1260
00:54:52.093 --> 00:54:55.390
Should we come see you? Are you going to come here?

1261
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:58.130
Man, we miss you so much.

1262
00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:00.580
We don't want to summon you or anything.

1263
00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:01.570
MARISHA: Do we still have cupcakes?

1264
00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:02.940
Bribe him with cupcakes.

1265
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.420
LAURA: It's too late. I already ate them all.

1266
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.690
MATT: You have other spell slots.

1267
00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:08.523
No.

1268
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.784
TALIESIN: Summon Cupcake.

1269
00:55:10.784 --> 00:55:13.317
MATT: He responds a moment later with "Ah, so you have

1270
00:55:13.317 --> 00:55:15.891
"returned. Then I will gather myself

1271
00:55:15.891 --> 00:55:18.860
"and head to your abode posthaste."

1272
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.693
LAURA: He's on his way.

1273
00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:22.526
SAM: Perfect.

1274
00:55:23.415 --> 00:55:24.390
LIAM: Okay.

1275
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:25.337
MARISHA: Okay.

1276
00:55:25.337 --> 00:55:26.752
MATT: A short time later.

1277
00:55:26.752 --> 00:55:27.910
(knocking)

1278
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:29.179
LAURA: He's here.

1279
00:55:29.179 --> 00:55:30.370
(laughter)

1280
00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:32.060
TRAVIS: He's here.
SAM: I'll get it.

1281
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.580
Mage Hand, open the door.

1282
00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.253
MATT: It opens.

1283
00:55:35.253 --> 00:55:36.878
TALIESIN: Ting, ting, ting, ting.
MATT: Yep.

1284
00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:40.331
TALIESIN: I have needs.
MATT: Indeed.

1285
00:55:40.331 --> 00:55:42.340
He makes his way in.

1286
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.960
"Well, it is good to see that you have survived

1287
00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.440
"your encounter, it would seem, with the dragon's den,

1288
00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.750
"of which I last sent you."

1289
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:53.630
LAURA: Yeah, we were amazing.

1290
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:54.710
TALIESIN: Quite successful.

1291
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:56.860
TRAVIS: A bit of a close shave, but we made it.

1292
00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:57.693
MATT: "Good."

1293
00:55:57.693 --> 00:55:58.600
LIAM: Good at improvising.

1294
00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.770
MARISHA: The dragon's name was Gelidon.

1295
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.500
LAURA: Never even saw us there.

1296
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:04.741
TALIESIN: Well...

1297
00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:07.480
LAURA: Mostly.
TALIESIN: Mostly.

1298
00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.570
Somewhat, a little.

1299
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.080
MATT: "Still, very impressive.

1300
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.380
"Not many have done what you've done

1301
00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:15.270
"and come back unscathed, it seems.

1302
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:16.847
"I'm impressed myself.

1303
00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:19.840
"So,

1304
00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.250
"what is it you've summoned me for?"

1305
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:25.566
LIAM: Well, we have been running our errands

1306
00:56:25.566 --> 00:56:26.408
and we are back.

1307
00:56:26.408 --> 00:56:29.110
We feel it has been awhile since we have

1308
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:34.088
checked in with the Queen and yourself

1309
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:39.820
and we mean to be of use, if we may

1310
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.653
and I hope--

1311
00:56:40.653 --> 00:56:42.087
LAURA: And I want to say a big thank you again

1312
00:56:42.087 --> 00:56:44.470
for taking us to where we needed to go.

1313
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:46.960
I just want you to know that, but okay, keep going.

1314
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.060
LIAM: No, it's fine.
MATT: "Of course."

1315
00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.230
LIAM: Our track record has been a little less stellar

1316
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:52.590
than I would have liked, but I would hope

1317
00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:55.930
that this encounter with a White Dragon would--

1318
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.480
MARISHA: Wait, what?

1319
00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.888
We're fucking great.

1320
00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.610
TRAVIS: Well, we also haven't heard about

1321
00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:06.263
any reports from, you know, our last

1322
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.050
incident.
MARISHA: Oh.

1323
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:11.940
TALIESIN: We were curious if there had been any word

1324
00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:15.920
of any sight of the Laughing Hand or this creature?

1325
00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.460
MATT: "At this point, no.

1326
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:21.712
"We have been researching and putting out

1327
00:57:21.712 --> 00:57:23.960
"requests for any sort of sightings of the creature

1328
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.640
"that you had mentioned, as well as perhaps

1329
00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.330
"this individual that was once among you.

1330
00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:32.330
"None have come back, but we are indeed looking,

1331
00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:33.420
"so do not worry."

1332
00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.030
TRAVIS: To be clear, did you send

1333
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:37.360
anyone to the location that we mentioned?

1334
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.840
I mean, certainly there must have been

1335
00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.940
some sort of remnant or sign that they were there.

1336
00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.350
MATT: "There were indeed signs within the interior

1337
00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:48.895
"of this King's Cage that you mentioned.

1338
00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:53.010
"However, there was no sign beyond the exit

1339
00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:55.890
"and what winds and sands of the Barbed Fields

1340
00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:58.160
"have washed away what

1341
00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:03.320
"symbols or footsteps may have led us in their direction.

1342
00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:06.376
"But we are looking, do not worry."

1343
00:58:06.376 --> 00:58:09.365
LIAM: I think we are also possibly curious about--

1344
00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:15.610
the Queen mentioned beacons still within the Empire

1345
00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:20.445
and if we can, perhaps, steal the breath from a dragon,

1346
00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.660
it stands to reason that we could help with those as well.

1347
00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:24.900
MATT: "Good, so you are now in

1348
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:28.407
"a place to call in some of the debt."

1349
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.770
SAM: Yes.
LIAM: Indeed.

1350
00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:32.880
MATT: "Good.

1351
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.140
"There is indeed one beacons that

1352
00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.877
"still remains in the grasp of the Empire.

1353
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:43.115
"We have numerous ways of pushing towards that goal.

1354
00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:48.350
"However, should you have been careful in your dealings,

1355
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.350
"you have a little more reach within the Empire

1356
00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:55.578
"than someone such as I would, of course.

1357
00:58:57.010 --> 00:59:00.250
"I would request on the behalf of the Bright Queen

1358
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:04.320
"to see if you can discover

1359
00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.153
"where this beacon is being held."

1360
00:59:08.027 --> 00:59:09.340
LAURA: Okay.

1361
00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.790
MATT: "I get the sense that perhaps you've had

1362
00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:15.790
"some encounters with members of the Academy.

1363
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:20.055
"Maybe the Assembly or at least people who can connect you?

1364
00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:22.740
"From what we understand, they seem

1365
00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:27.532
"to be directly involved in the acquisitions

1366
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:30.970
"of the beacons and most likely hold

1367
00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:33.500
"or know where the current one is being held.

1368
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.775
"If you can bring us this information,

1369
00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:38.130
"you may be aiding in bringing

1370
00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:40.622
"an end to this conflict sooner than later."

1371
00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:44.587
LIAM: Have you any ideas of individuals?

1372
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:48.373
MATT: "Well, I could name off the Assembly for you,

1373
00:59:48.373 --> 00:59:52.315
"if you'd like. But I get the sense you already know them."

1374
00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.223
LIAM: I am familiar, <i>ja</i>.

1375
00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:57.360
MARISHA: Can I get the sense he's being

1376
00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.760
genuine when he talks about ending the conflict?

1377
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.263
MATT: Make an insight check.

1378
01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:07.180
TRAVIS: You need to fucking warm it up.

1379
01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.700
MARISHA: Yeah, I do.
LIAM: Yeah, right?

1380
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:10.700
LIAM: Two threes.

1381
01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.200
TRAVIS: Because that will not fly.

1382
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.278
MARISHA: No. I'm supposed

1383
01:00:13.278 --> 01:00:14.400
to be good at this shit.
LAURA: Oh can, oh wait,

1384
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.050
can I give you Guidance? Is it too late?

1385
01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:17.691
MATT: It's too late. You've got to do it

1386
01:00:17.691 --> 01:00:19.066
before the roll, sorry.

1387
01:00:19.066 --> 01:00:21.480
LAURA: Everybody take longer to pick up your dice.

1388
01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.990
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: So I can remember.

1389
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:24.480
TALIESIN: I think we both can do Guidance.

1390
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.950
MATT: He's pretty much always been Essek,

1391
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:30.190
his manner and demeanor rarely changes.

1392
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:31.915
So it's kind of hard to read.

1393
01:00:32.782 --> 01:00:35.735
SAM: ♪ It's just Essek ♪

1394
01:00:35.735 --> 01:00:37.920
MARISHA: God damn you, Essek.

1395
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.978
Okay.

1396
01:00:38.978 --> 01:00:39.811
LAURA: All right.

1397
01:00:39.811 --> 01:00:43.160
LIAM: We do have ties in the Empire.

1398
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.968
MATT: "Good."
LIAM: Some connections.

1399
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:48.640
In all these rumors that you are parsing out,

1400
01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.130
is there any area of the Empire in particular

1401
01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:57.760
you have heard of this thing being seen last?

1402
01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.020
MATT: "Unfortunately, such information changes.

1403
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.490
"You see, they know as well as I do that it's dangerous

1404
01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:07.320
"to keep it in one place for more than a period of time.

1405
01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.960
"Such a central artifact would be moved often, most likely.

1406
01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:14.800
"Your guess is as good as mine.

1407
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.840
"Should you learn this information,

1408
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.810
"for this reason, you need to let us know soon."

1409
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:21.603
TRAVIS: Do you happen to have any

1410
01:01:21.603 --> 01:01:25.900
other teams on this sort of quest?

1411
01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:29.400
MATT: "Oh, we have a few spies throughout, yes."

1412
01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.443
TRAVIS: Any way that we would be able to identify them

1413
01:01:33.443 --> 01:01:35.980
just in case we happen to cross each other's paths?

1414
01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.800
MATT: "Not at all."

1415
01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:38.633
TRAVIS: I figured.

1416
01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.620
SAM: What about that prisoner that they're keeping, Caleb?

1417
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.720
Would that be a place to start?

1418
01:01:47.626 --> 01:01:48.460
LIAM: It couldn't hurt.

1419
01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.960
MATT: "You have a couple more days

1420
01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.540
"before the execution is carried out, so

1421
01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.306
"I would recommend you doing what

1422
01:01:54.306 --> 01:01:56.089
"you are looking to do soon."

1423
01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.890
LIAM: If today works, I will do it today.

1424
01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:02.123
MATT: "I could escort you."

1425
01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:05.908
TALIESIN: You want help?
LAURA: You want some company?

1426
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.200
LIAM: Definitely someone, <i>ja</i>.

1427
01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.250
LAURA: I'll come with you.

1428
01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:13.252
TALIESIN: I'd be happy to as well.

1429
01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:15.110
LIAM: All right.

1430
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:21.083
SAM: Are you going to threaten her?

1431
01:02:22.595 --> 01:02:24.192
LIAM: I'm going to talk to her.

1432
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.983
SAM: All right.

1433
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:30.970
LIAM: No time like the present.

1434
01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:33.907
MATT: "Very well then, come with me, Widogast."

1435
01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.530
TRAVIS: Both the fucking clerics are going.

1436
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:37.363
We should go, too.

1437
01:02:37.363 --> 01:02:39.025
MARISHA: I guess we'll go.

1438
01:02:39.025 --> 01:02:40.380
SAM: Are we all going? We're all going to go?

1439
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.247
MARISHA: I guess so.
SAM: Okay.

1440
01:02:42.247 --> 01:02:43.080
Is that okay?

1441
01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.740
MATT: "A party, then.

1442
01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.420
"Well come, we leave immediately,"

1443
01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:51.010
and he whooshes around and glides through the open door.

1444
01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.680
You guys are all heading with him?

1445
01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.740
SAM: Yeah, if that's all right with you, Caleb.

1446
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:59.080
LIAM: As long as we don't, you know, crowd the cell itself.

1447
01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.750
TRAVIS: No, of course not.

1448
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.230
Here for support, if you need it.

1449
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:04.063
MATT: All right.

1450
01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.840
LAURA: And Guidance, whenever you need it.

1451
01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.155
TRAVIS: Before the roll.

1452
01:03:09.155 --> 01:03:09.988
LAURA: Yes.

1453
01:03:09.988 --> 01:03:11.888
LIAM: That's touch, right?
LAURA: Yes.

1454
01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:12.830
LIAM: Yeah.

1455
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:14.670
MATT: All right, following Essek, you're brought

1456
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:16.950
through the familiar space of the Shadowshire

1457
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:19.100
beneath the center of the city of Rosohna

1458
01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.120
towards the Dungeon of Penance through

1459
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.580
the strangely off-putting interior and you're feeling

1460
01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.490
the central enchantment of the space

1461
01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:30.820
clouding your mind but a bit, but eventually

1462
01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:33.390
you find yourself standing at the familiar cell

1463
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:36.350
where you first had met the prisoner.

1464
01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:40.370
Glancing through the small hole in the doorway,

1465
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:44.650
you can see the female figure currently sitting,

1466
01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:46.640
arms bound behind her back.

1467
01:03:47.564 --> 01:03:48.550
It looks like shackles

1468
01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:50.960
holding them to her ankles from behind.

1469
01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.420
Chains from each arm and each leg

1470
01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.680
affixed to all sides of the room and there

1471
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.440
are multiple guards at all times keeping watch.

1472
01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.010
LIAM: Outside the cell?
MATT: Outside the cell, yes.

1473
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:04.640
LIAM: The chains, does she look like taut or is it loose?

1474
01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.760
MATT: They're somewhat lax.

1475
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.770
They're not taut like she's being suspended.

1476
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:09.375
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: She can't probably move

1477
01:04:09.375 --> 01:04:12.180
more than a foot in any direction, should she wanted to.

1478
01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.150
LIAM: Would you trust me enough to enter the cell with her?

1479
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.540
MATT: Essek looks to the guards. The guards give a nod.

1480
01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.981
He looks back to you.

1481
01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.550
"I just would recommend nothing funny.

1482
01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:34.838
"For should such things occur--"

1483
01:04:36.171 --> 01:04:39.617
LIAM: I would not jeopardize our place here in the Dynasty.

1484
01:04:39.617 --> 01:04:40.975
MATT: "I would hope you would not

1485
01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:44.252
"and you seem like an

1486
01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.600
"upstanding practitioner of the arcane arts

1487
01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.560
"with interests in the greater mysteries of life,

1488
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.395
"that you would not throw your life away so quickly.

1489
01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.453
"Open the door."

1490
01:04:59.453 --> 01:05:02.350
(door creaking)

1491
01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:06.407
It's pushed open. Essek's hand glides

1492
01:05:06.407 --> 01:05:09.720
out of the cloak and gives the universal

1493
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:12.940
hand motion for "you first."

1494
01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.850
LIAM: You said, is she facing away from the door?

1495
01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:20.290
MATT: She's currently facing the door but the head's down,

1496
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:22.760
straggly, greasy hair on her face.

1497
01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.730
There's very little light in here, if at all.

1498
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:26.980
Most of the people who work this area

1499
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.190
don't need light to see in the area.

1500
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:30.880
So darkness is a consistent thing.

1501
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.030
You get the sense at this point that the prisoner,

1502
01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:38.030
who is human-- I believe so, let me double-check real fast.

1503
01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.073
Yes.

1504
01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.020
Has been in darkness for quite some time.

1505
01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.602
She also looked quite emaciated, pale.

1506
01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:47.290
There's a stench to the chamber.

1507
01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.940
This prisoner has not been kept comfortably

1508
01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:55.232
in the time that you've bought for her life.

1509
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:58.243
LIAM: I enter

1510
01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:04.257
and I sit on the cell floor

1511
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:08.502
a safe distance away, but directly in front of her.

1512
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.992
(American accent) I'll confirm what you already know.

1513
01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.779
MATT: You guys hear Zemnian.

1514
01:06:20.779 --> 01:06:22.877
If I recall, this is what we did last time.

1515
01:06:22.877 --> 01:06:24.360
TRAVIS: I was like, "What?!"
SAM: That's right.

1516
01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.460
LAURA: I'm just going to come in the cell

1517
01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.080
behind Caleb and like lean against the bars

1518
01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.210
and keep my head down, just like behind him.

1519
01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:31.043
MATT: Okay.

1520
01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.609
TALIESIN: I'll join as a Disguise Self,

1521
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:37.377
as an elf so I don't stick out.

1522
01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:43.250
LIAM: I am Bren Aldric Ermendrud.

1523
01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.710
Do you want to tell me your name?

1524
01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:53.560
MATT: "It doesn't matter, does it?"

1525
01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.183
LIAM: Well,

1526
01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:01.070
you will be dead in a few days,

1527
01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:03.170
but I wouldn't say that it doesn't mater.

1528
01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:09.390
MATT: "Do you have a way of getting me out,

1529
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:11.765
"friend of the Dynasty?"

1530
01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:16.965
LIAM: I don't know.

1531
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:22.072
But I do have something to offer.

1532
01:07:25.546 --> 01:07:27.071
I'm curious.

1533
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.620
You've done a lot for the Assembly.

1534
01:07:33.957 --> 01:07:36.090
I know that you've killed many

1535
01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.313
enemies of the Empire, of the throne.

1536
01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:49.610
I am very curious to know how it would affect you

1537
01:07:49.610 --> 01:07:54.610
if you knew that some of those you robbed of their breath

1538
01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:56.300
were innocent,

1539
01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.515
completely innocent.

1540
01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.865
As loyal

1541
01:08:02.865 --> 01:08:03.773
as you.

1542
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:08.325
What would that do

1543
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.385
to you?

1544
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:13.263
MATT: At this point, you've just

1545
01:08:13.263 --> 01:08:14.750
seen the hair on the front of her face.

1546
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:16.620
The head slightly moves up

1547
01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.970
and peeking through a sliver of the greasy, dark hair,

1548
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:23.572
you can see one eye look up to you.

1549
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:31.665
"We both trained under the same man.

1550
01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.898
"You know the answer to that.

1551
01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:38.840
"There are things bigger than innocence."

1552
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.840
LIAM: It doesn't haunt you at all to know that some

1553
01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.822
of the deeds you've committed were predicated on lies?

1554
01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.760
MATT: "I had my heart beaten out of me a long time ago.

1555
01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:01.830
"Now, it's about guiding history.

1556
01:09:03.732 --> 01:09:05.249
"It always has been."

1557
01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:20.905
LIAM: I don't know how my brothers and sisters

1558
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.570
could stomach wearing that mantle of loyalty,

1559
01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:32.112
knowing that it was woven so thoroughly from sin

1560
01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.235
and I am very sorry for you.

1561
01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:42.060
MATT: "Good men don't conquer.

1562
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:45.810
"They die and are forgotten.

1563
01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.220
"I'll die and be forgotten,

1564
01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.880
"but at least I know some of my deeds

1565
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:58.440
"will have changed the course of history."

1566
01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:03.550
LIAM: You've certainly learned your lessons by rote.

1567
01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:09.670
MATT: "You still have a few to learn too.

1568
01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:13.327
"I'm sure he'll find you.

1569
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:17.920
"He'll be happy to finish what he couldn't.

1570
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:26.983
"He doesn't like it when people don't do as he says."

1571
01:10:30.103 --> 01:10:34.261
LIAM: I'm sure it galls him, very much.

1572
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.170
Do you know, I think I'm a better

1573
01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:48.133
friend to the Empire than the lot of you.

1574
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:55.143
You didn't have to have this.

1575
01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:00.035
You shouldn't have had this.

1576
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:04.690
MATT: "It's a shame.

1577
01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:08.122
"So much potential and so little foresight."

1578
01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.463
LIAM: Did you know Astrid and Eodwulf?

1579
01:11:20.215 --> 01:11:22.018
Still alive?

1580
01:11:22.018 --> 01:11:23.920
MATT: "Hmm.

1581
01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.480
"I know them better than you do."

1582
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:28.532
LIAM: That's probably true.

1583
01:11:40.945 --> 01:11:44.700
It was folly thinking I could change your mind, I know.

1584
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.533
Why would I?

1585
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:48.743
MATT: "What do you want?

1586
01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.500
"Why did you come here?

1587
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.658
"None of this is surprising.

1588
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:58.792
""What do you want from me?"

1589
01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:06.640
LIAM: Maybe if I could talk plainly

1590
01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.510
with you and see one inch of change,

1591
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:13.172
then I wouldn't believe we're all damned.

1592
01:12:17.172 --> 01:12:18.005
MATT: "No.

1593
01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:22.950
"I hope this lesson has been very useful."

1594
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:28.043
LIAM: It has.

1595
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:34.687
You've made what I have to do very plain.

1596
01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:39.760
I don't know if you want it or not,

1597
01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.227
but I'll be staying around for the end.

1598
01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.635
I consider you

1599
01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:52.195
a sister, so even if you don't share the sentiment.

1600
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:58.970
MATT: She leans against the chains a bit,

1601
01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:03.015
tensing and you hear them pull and rattle.

1602
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.925
"Well,

1603
01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:14.230
"I've always been a little impatient."

1604
01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:17.450
You see a whip of motion as one of the chains

1605
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:21.230
goes slack and the arm arcs around towards you--

1606
01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.438
LIAM: Counterspell.

1607
01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.480
MATT: You go to cast Counterspell but there's no spell.

1608
01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.560
LAURA: Can I leap forward?

1609
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.360
MATT: Surprise round does not.

1610
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:34.890
Does that hit a 16?

1611
01:13:34.890 --> 01:13:35.980
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

1612
01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:36.813
MATT: Okay.

1613
01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:41.883
You suffer--

1614
01:13:45.002 --> 01:13:46.202
SAM: Chain him.

1615
01:13:47.315 --> 01:13:48.763
TRAVIS: No spells.

1616
01:13:48.763 --> 01:13:50.763
LIAM: Yeah, it's the prison.

1617
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:57.400
MATT: 26 points of piercing damage

1618
01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.033
as it looks like

1619
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:03.250
in one of the hands

1620
01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:06.010
where a chain had been wrenched free

1621
01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:08.868
is clutching a pointed piece of metal

1622
01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:14.150
that has been thrust into your clavicle and throat.

1623
01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:17.510
You guys watch as a pray of blood begins to (spraying)

1624
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:21.580
out of Caleb's chest as she pulls back to go in for--

1625
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.910
LIAM: Pull out the transmuter's stone

1626
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:27.080
and beat her across the face with it.

1627
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:27.913
MATT: Okay.

1628
01:14:27.913 --> 01:14:29.500
Go ahead and make an attack roll.

1629
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:34.415
LIAM: Natural 20.
TRAVIS: Boom.

1630
01:14:36.119 --> 01:14:37.320
MATT: All right.

1631
01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:41.460
Go ahead and, actually it's one point of damage times two.

1632
01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.536
We'll say two points of damage plus your strength modifier.

1633
01:14:43.536 --> 01:14:45.768
LIAM: Yeah, that's zero, I think it's zero.

1634
01:14:45.768 --> 01:14:46.730
Oh, it's plus one.

1635
01:14:46.730 --> 01:14:49.710
No wait, no that's saves, zero.

1636
01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:53.210
MATT: Okay so (smack), and what are you guys doing?

1637
01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:55.340
LAURA: I am leaping forward, I'm going to yell: Caduceus!

1638
01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:57.000
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Then I'm going to

1639
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.400
bash her upside the head with my shield.

1640
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:03.775
MATT: All right, roll for an attack with the shield.

1641
01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.820
LAURA: I don't know what I add to that.

1642
01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.510
SAM: Is it an unarmed strike, or?

1643
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:11.430
LAURA: That'd be an unarmed strike.

1644
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:12.500
MATT: This would be considered an unarmed strike,

1645
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.580
just for flavor with the shield--

1646
01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.057
LAURA: 20.

1647
01:15:15.057 --> 01:15:15.900
MATT: To hit?
LAURA: Yes.

1648
01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:19.010
MATT: Yeah, so that would definitely hit.

1649
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:21.063
It's one damage plus your strength modifier.

1650
01:15:21.063 --> 01:15:22.450
What are we doing, Caduceus?

1651
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:23.980
TALIESIN: I'm running in to separate them

1652
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.330
and get Caleb out of there.
LAURA: Yeah.

1653
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:27.870
I'm trying to push her back with the shield fore.

1654
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:31.045
MATT: All right, so yeah, you push her back.

1655
01:15:31.045 --> 01:15:33.540
The chains pull taut against the backside as she's

1656
01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:36.100
now pressed against the other half of the taut weight.

1657
01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.020
You pull Caleb back, the blood just (gushing)

1658
01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.510
out of the wound, she managed to not strike

1659
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:45.490
quite as vitally as she had hoped.

1660
01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:47.240
Though in the moment, it still frightens you

1661
01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.710
to see the amount of blood with a simple puncture.

1662
01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:53.640
The guards immediately rush in and raising their crossbows,

1663
01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.460
fill her chest with bolts.
LIAM: Wait!

1664
01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.370
MATT: At which point, you watch as she begins to lift up

1665
01:15:58.370 --> 01:16:00.900
off the ground from the chains and you see Essek,

1666
01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:04.094
his hand out of his cloak lifting her off the ground.

1667
01:16:04.094 --> 01:16:06.460
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

1668
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.640
MATT: You see her like (choking)

1669
01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.850
and blood pouring from the corners

1670
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:12.580
of her mouth, her eyes wide.

1671
01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.150
Essek just looks to you.

1672
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.848
LIAM: I walk up to her and just stare

1673
01:16:18.848 --> 01:16:22.018
into her eyes from six inches away.

1674
01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:24.983
SAM: Whoa.

1675
01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:28.853
LIAM: To Essek.

1676
01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:31.860
MATT: (crunching)

1677
01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:35.400
You watch as her entire central torso

1678
01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.280
crushes inward, the chains go taut and (squeaking)

1679
01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.070
you hear the metal bend as some of the chains

1680
01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:43.950
begin to pull and break in places

1681
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:46.090
before she is dropped to the ground limply.

1682
01:16:46.090 --> 01:16:48.440
LAURA: I'm going to look into
Caleb's eyes as that was happening.

1683
01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.890
I wanted to see what he was--

1684
01:16:50.969 --> 01:16:53.086
TALIESIN: I am helping apply pressure.

1685
01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.040
MARISHA: You got any healing spells with that pressure, Cad?

1686
01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.810
TALIESIN: We can't do them in here, we got to--

1687
01:16:59.810 --> 01:17:01.980
MARISHA: Move him out, here, I'll help Cad move him out.

1688
01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:03.820
SAM: We can't do it in here?

1689
01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.440
MARISHA: Out of the cell, out of the cell.

1690
01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.273
SAM: Why not?

1691
01:17:06.273 --> 01:17:08.530
LAURA: Can we heal him, can we heal him?

1692
01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:10.732
We can heal him, we can heal him.

1693
01:17:10.732 --> 01:17:11.935
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll go do it.

1694
01:17:11.935 --> 01:17:12.960
MATT: They've already loaded new bolts into

1695
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.339
the crossbow and they're all just keeping

1696
01:17:14.339 --> 01:17:17.140
an eye on the somewhat mashed corpse.

1697
01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.890
TALIESIN and LAURA: Cure Wounds.

1698
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:20.780
TALIESIN: I'll just do like a level three Cure Wounds.

1699
01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:21.970
That ought to do it.

1700
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:26.231
LAURA: Let's see what you got because if not, I'll do it.

1701
01:17:26.231 --> 01:17:27.772
Look at those dice.

1702
01:17:27.772 --> 01:17:30.006
TALIESIN: I know. Isn't that nice?

1703
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.153
12.

1704
01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:37.670
18 points of healing.

1705
01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:38.520
LAURA: I'll do Cure Wounds.

1706
01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.780
It looks like he's still bleeding a little bit.

1707
01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:43.530
I'll do a level two.
MATT: All righty.

1708
01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:50.270
TRAVIS: That took an unexpected turn.

1709
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:51.911
MARISHA: I kind of saw that whole thing coming,

1710
01:17:51.911 --> 01:17:53.386
not going to lie.

1711
01:17:53.386 --> 01:17:54.610
SAM: Did she, are you okay?

1712
01:17:54.610 --> 01:17:56.740
Did she give you any useful information?

1713
01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:59.498
LAURA: 12 additional healing.

1714
01:17:59.498 --> 01:18:01.610
LIAM: Oh yes.

1715
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:02.840
SAM: Yes?
LIAM: Oh yes.

1716
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.498
TALIESIN: Do you have anything else you want to

1717
01:18:05.498 --> 01:18:07.430
talk to her about?

1718
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:08.633
SAM: Oh.

1719
01:18:08.633 --> 01:18:12.750
TRAVIS: I don't think she's going to hear it.

1720
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.360
LIAM: I don't think she would be willing.

1721
01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.252
TALIESIN: That can always be handled.

1722
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.583
TRAVIS: Oh.
LIAM: Oh yes.

1723
01:18:19.583 --> 01:18:22.820
TALIESIN: Death is just a pause.
LIAM: Oh yes.

1724
01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:24.440
SAM: She still might not want to talk.

1725
01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.640
MARISHA: It kind of seemed like--

1726
01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.728
LIAM: Essek.

1727
01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.622
Would you allow us

1728
01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:38.812
to use this corpse for an interrogation?

1729
01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:47.230
MATT: "Under our supervision, quickly

1730
01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:51.190
"and do not mention that I allowed this to anybody."

1731
01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:53.480
Essek looks to the guards there and he says,

1732
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.322
"And that goes for you as well."

1733
01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:58.146
The guards all--

1734
01:18:58.146 --> 01:18:59.312
TRAVIS: Taking a risk, I like it.

1735
01:18:59.312 --> 01:19:00.848
MATT: Nod and step back a bit

1736
01:19:00.848 --> 01:19:03.962
and move away from the chamber.

1737
01:19:08.174 --> 01:19:09.740
TALIESIN: I don't know if I have it ready today

1738
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:13.450
but we just have to keep the, we don't need much.

1739
01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.153
SAM: It got weird.

1740
01:19:17.115 --> 01:19:17.948
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

1741
01:19:17.948 --> 01:19:20.114
LIAM: Sorry, I've got an idea.

1742
01:19:20.114 --> 01:19:23.667
SAM: ♪ And I know I'm a fool ♪

1743
01:19:23.667 --> 01:19:28.550
TRAVIS and MATT: ♪ Get my baby to love me tonight ♪

1744
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:31.343
TALIESIN: If you give me a day.

1745
01:19:31.343 --> 01:19:32.737
SAM: ♪ The fecal of carton ♪

1746
01:19:32.737 --> 01:19:34.110
LIAM: To speak with her.

1747
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:36.273
TALIESIN: I just need a head.

1748
01:19:36.273 --> 01:19:37.106
LIAM: Oh.

1749
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:41.200
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought my friends were prepared.

1750
01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.420
TALIESIN: I wasn't ready to do it immediately, but--

1751
01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:44.010
LAURA: We could take her head with us.

1752
01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:45.900
SAM: Oh, god.

1753
01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.030
MATT: "Unfortunately, no."

1754
01:19:49.414 --> 01:19:50.247
SAM: You can't do it right now?

1755
01:19:50.247 --> 01:19:52.710
MATT: "This need to be notified immediately

1756
01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:56.820
"to the rest of the dens and the body needs to be produced.

1757
01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:58.590
"So if there's something you cannot do now,

1758
01:19:58.590 --> 01:19:59.890
"I'm afraid it cannot be done."

1759
01:19:59.890 --> 01:20:02.420
LIAM: But we would find information

1760
01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.520
in a way that we were not just able to do.

1761
01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.570
I think that we could speak to her.

1762
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.830
I have seem him do it.

1763
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:14.290
MATT: "Are you attempting to speak to the corpse?"

1764
01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:15.470
TALIESIN: Yes.

1765
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:16.800
LIAM: As her master, yes.

1766
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.000
MATT: "Then I cannot allow it.

1767
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.697
"That is standard procedure after execution

1768
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:26.960
"and the body cannot be utilized in the same way again.

1769
01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.520
"If they attempt to make the body

1770
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.780
"available for such a ritual and it does not work,

1771
01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:35.840
"they will know that it has been done in advance.

1772
01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:38.110
"Which will lead them to me, which will lead them to you."

1773
01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:39.201
MARISHA: Can't we just request to be in

1774
01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.767
the room when they do it?

1775
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.250
MATT: "I think that might be stepping beyond

1776
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:48.150
"the bounds of which your arrangement here is--"

1777
01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:51.780
TRAVIS: That seems fair.
MATT: "--situated, my apologies.

1778
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:56.610
"I want to help as much as I can but there are limitations."

1779
01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:59.477
TALIESIN: You know, I think she did this intentionally.

1780
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:02.380
I think this was--
LAURA: Well, yeah.

1781
01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:05.140
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, all things considered,

1782
01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:06.400
it's a clever way of making sure

1783
01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.637
you can't ask any more questions.

1784
01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.830
TRAVIS: She was also waiting for this opportunity.

1785
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:14.840
LIAM: What if she knows where the beacon is now?

1786
01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.710
MATT: "Then we will find it from the body.

1787
01:21:17.710 --> 01:21:20.530
"But you can't be the ones to do it.

1788
01:21:20.530 --> 01:21:23.610
"There is protocol and the last thing you need

1789
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:27.988
"is anything like this to be traced back to me or you."

1790
01:21:29.410 --> 01:21:31.513
TRAVIS: You've been more than generous.

1791
01:21:32.603 --> 01:21:33.994
LAURA: You really have.

1792
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.511
LIAM: Very much so.

1793
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:41.125
Caleb wanders over to her corpse

1794
01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.140
and kneels

1795
01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.433
and with his own bloody hand

1796
01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.765
wipes her hair out of her eyes.

1797
01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.118
I'm sorry.

1798
01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.400
I think we are done here.

1799
01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.530
MATT: "I think we are."

1800
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:07.960
TALIESIN: Are there any scars on the body?

1801
01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.505
MATT: Well, the arms and legs

1802
01:22:10.505 --> 01:22:13.240
have been nearly pulled out of their sockets.

1803
01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.640
Where the torso has been crushed inward

1804
01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.985
and the chains have been pulled taut,

1805
01:22:15.985 --> 01:22:18.490
essentially the body was pulled away from the limbs

1806
01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:20.150
to the point where they're still attached,

1807
01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:24.180
but definitive separation internally.

1808
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:26.370
Most of the torso has been crushed inward.

1809
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:29.130
The jaw has been broken in and it's--

1810
01:22:30.052 --> 01:22:31.060
TALIESIN: I was specifically curious about

1811
01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.185
the arms and legs.

1812
01:22:32.185 --> 01:22:33.730
MATT: The arms and legs, you do notice

1813
01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:35.450
there are scars among the forearms

1814
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:38.290
that are similar to the ones that Caleb has.

1815
01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:39.960
TALIESIN: I'd like to, if it's all right,

1816
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.920
quickly just approach the body for a second.

1817
01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:45.950
MATT: As you do, Essek goes "Careful.

1818
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:48.108
"You do have to leave soon."

1819
01:22:48.108 --> 01:22:48.941
TALIESIN: Of course.

1820
01:22:48.941 --> 01:22:51.368
MATT: "No funny business."
TALIESIN: Nothing funny.

1821
01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:55.990
I want to palpate the region.

1822
01:22:55.990 --> 01:23:00.147
I want to press the arm and see what the scars feel like.

1823
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:02.830
MATT: Okay, make a medicine check.

1824
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:03.800
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1825
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.460
LAURA: I'm going to look over Caduceus'

1826
01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.130
shoulder because I know what he's doing.

1827
01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:08.830
MATT: What are you trying to figure out from this?

1828
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:10.970
TALIESIN: I want to know what caused the scars.

1829
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:13.233
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I want to know--

1830
01:23:13.233 --> 01:23:14.066
LAURA: I don't know what he's doing.

1831
01:23:14.066 --> 01:23:15.740
TRAVIS: You thought he was trying to milk it?

1832
01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.000
LAURA: No, I thought he was going to

1833
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.500
see if there's still crystals in there.

1834
01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.333
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1835
01:23:19.333 --> 01:23:21.424
TALIESIN: I don't think I would know that yet,

1836
01:23:21.424 --> 01:23:24.040
but I do know they're magic scars because I've seen his.

1837
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.372
MATT: Well, you know the scars.

1838
01:23:25.372 --> 01:23:26.205
Go ahead and make a medicine check

1839
01:23:26.205 --> 01:23:28.948
to ascertain the nature of the scars.

1840
01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.170
TALIESIN: 25.

1841
01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:34.117
MATT: Okay, looking them over, you can see there are

1842
01:23:34.117 --> 01:23:36.468
multiple, probably for each arm somewhere in the

1843
01:23:36.468 --> 01:23:39.826
neighborhood of 20 to 30 individual scars

1844
01:23:39.826 --> 01:23:41.342
that are puncture scars.

1845
01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.717
They aren't seemingly violent

1846
01:23:44.717 --> 01:23:47.758
and they've healed over fine, but they are placed in...

1847
01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:52.670
While at first glance it appears to be random,

1848
01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:55.520
you can see faint

1849
01:23:56.550 --> 01:24:00.150
patterns in their placement in the arms, intentional.

1850
01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:02.940
TALIESIN: Does it look like runes or anything like that?

1851
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.810
MATT: Not like runes but you get the sense that at least

1852
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:08.510
these scars are deliberate and they're mirrored on each arm.

1853
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:12.297
TRAVIS: Did we check if that chain got broken?

1854
01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:14.870
TALIESIN: Caleb?

1855
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:16.100
LIAM: Yeah.

1856
01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:17.400
TALIESIN: Is this the same thing that happened to you?

1857
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.760
MARISHA: Afraid to touch anything, I'll get yelled at.

1858
01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.123
LIAM: Yes, all of his...

1859
01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.033
(quietly) students.

1860
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:26.383
TALIESIN: Okay.

1861
01:24:28.512 --> 01:24:29.860
MARISHA: I think we should get out of here.

1862
01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:30.693
LIAM: Yes.

1863
01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.480
TRAVIS: One last thing, did she just manage

1864
01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.730
to break that chain or file it down, or?

1865
01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:40.750
It seemed like she was under lock and key.

1866
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:42.820
How did that happen?

1867
01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:46.435
MATT: "Yes, I am very curious about that myself."

1868
01:24:46.435 --> 01:24:48.790
And the other guards look at each other.

1869
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:51.150
Getting back to their posts, one of them begins talking.

1870
01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:53.507
None of you speak Undercommon, correct?

1871
01:24:55.371 --> 01:24:56.846
LAURA: Fuck.
SAM: Just Overcommon.

1872
01:24:58.190 --> 01:24:59.060
MATT: So yeah, none of you here.

1873
01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.160
There is some conversation back and forth

1874
01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.120
between Essek and one of the guards.

1875
01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.650
Essek gets a little more infuriated.

1876
01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:07.210
The guard backs down a little bit.

1877
01:25:07.210 --> 01:25:10.640
He seems to curtail and step back into his position.

1878
01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.840
Essek looks back at you.

1879
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:16.780
"Well, it seems that these

1880
01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.970
"Scourgers,

1881
01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:21.505
"these Vollstrecker are well-trained."

1882
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:25.560
SAM: We should get going.

1883
01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.310
Just out of curiosity, I'm going to

1884
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:29.920
just go over and check out the body.

1885
01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.670
How tall was she?

1886
01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:35.003
MATT: Best you can glance beside

1887
01:25:35.003 --> 01:25:37.111
the crushed status of the body,

1888
01:25:37.111 --> 01:25:38.050
from what you've seen, probably in

1889
01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:41.210
the neighborhood of between like 5'2" and 5'6".

1890
01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:43.900
SAM: Can you study her features?

1891
01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:46.190
LAURA: I've been doing that while

1892
01:25:46.190 --> 01:25:47.510
they were having the conversation.

1893
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:49.450
SAM: You think you could make yourself look like her?

1894
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:51.050
LAURA: Obviously.
SAM: All right, good.

1895
01:25:52.263 --> 01:25:53.388
MATT: Okay, so you study--

1896
01:25:53.388 --> 01:25:55.660
SAM: But like a slightly better looking--

1897
01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.370
LAURA: Right, she's real crazy right now.

1898
01:25:57.370 --> 01:25:58.480
TALIESIN: A haircut.

1899
01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.290
LIAM: Also out of character,

1900
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:03.240
did she seem younger or older than Caleb?

1901
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.820
MATT: Younger than Caleb.

1902
01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.250
You'd probably guess looking at her--

1903
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:10.480
it's hard to tell with how emaciated and unhealthy

1904
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.930
she is from the time she spent here after being captured

1905
01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:16.682
but you surmise somewhere in the mid to late 20s.

1906
01:26:16.682 --> 01:26:19.470
TALIESIN: Xhorhasi High, the next generation.

1907
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:20.809
TRAVIS: Stop it.

1908
01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:22.680
MATT: Goddammit.

1909
01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.380
TALIESIN: Sorry.
TRAVIS: Let's get out of here.

1910
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:26.720
SAM: Okay, home we go.

1911
01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:31.280
MATT: All right, Essek leads you out of the prison

1912
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.230
and back to your home above ground.

1913
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.700
What would you like to do?

1914
01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.390
SAM: I don't know, what do we do?

1915
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:40.970
MARISHA: Are we going to check in with the Bright Queen?

1916
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:42.110
Do we need to like--
LAURA: No.

1917
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:43.616
MARISHA: --apply for that?

1918
01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:45.091
LAURA: I don't think we need to do that.

1919
01:26:45.091 --> 01:26:46.450
SAM: This is our mission.
TRAVIS: Towards our debt.

1920
01:26:46.450 --> 01:26:47.970
LIAM: Is Essek still with?

1921
01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:48.803
MATT: He would still be with you,

1922
01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:50.200
unless you tell him to leave.

1923
01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.070
LIAM: So is it

1924
01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.810
on us? There are no resources of any kind

1925
01:26:55.810 --> 01:27:00.530
that you could provide in our foray back to the Empire?

1926
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:02.180
TRAVIS: A lead of arrow.

1927
01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:05.090
MATT: "What kind of resources would you require?

1928
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:07.480
"Everything is being placed into the war effort right now.

1929
01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.830
"So it is a bit stretched."

1930
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:11.940
LIAM: Information. Do you know

1931
01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.670
the last place this beacon was seen?

1932
01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:17.290
MATT: "The last place that we know of it was in Felderwin."

1933
01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:18.310
LIAM: Felderwin.
TRAVIS: Felderwin.

1934
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:20.858
You don't happen to have any safe houses

1935
01:27:20.858 --> 01:27:24.954
or bases of operation behind enemy lines?

1936
01:27:24.954 --> 01:27:27.810
MATT: "We have a few locations that we've established.

1937
01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:31.620
"For the purposes of keeping them safe,

1938
01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.590
"respectfully, I cannot tell you."

1939
01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:35.601
SAM: Felderwin.

1940
01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:42.637
The tripod, we have the tripod. Does that help us at all?

1941
01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.553
LAURA: We'll find out.

1942
01:27:46.553 --> 01:27:48.270
SAM: Did it touch it, does that count?

1943
01:27:49.419 --> 01:27:50.857
Can we scry on that or anything?

1944
01:27:50.857 --> 01:27:52.173
No, I guess not.

1945
01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:56.401
LIAM: Are you able to scry on things

1946
01:27:56.401 --> 01:27:58.467
you have never seen before?

1947
01:27:58.467 --> 01:28:01.110
It would be similar obviously to the one that we possessed.

1948
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:02.427
TRAVIS: How would it pick between the two?

1949
01:28:02.427 --> 01:28:04.330
LAURA: Let me think about that for a minute.

1950
01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:05.345
TALIESIN: If I was clever,

1951
01:28:05.345 --> 01:28:07.800
I would have it very protected from such things.

1952
01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:08.789
LAURA: Yeah, like--

1953
01:28:08.789 --> 01:28:10.710
LIAM: We've got to start somewhere, though.

1954
01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:14.700
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on, let me look at my spell.

1955
01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.130
I know a lot about it, I just--

1956
01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:18.140
SAM: I mean we could go back to Felderwin

1957
01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:21.010
and retrace their steps, I suppose. We could--

1958
01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:22.900
MARISHA: You know--

1959
01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:27.150
LIAM: We could try to get our hands on a living Scourger.

1960
01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:30.310
LAURA: It's a creature sort of thing. I can scry on people.

1961
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:31.470
MATT: You can scry on a location,

1962
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:34.380
but you had to have seen the location before.

1963
01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.350
LAURA: I can scry on a location

1964
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:38.960
or a people, but not like an object, right?

1965
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:39.820
MATT: Correct.

1966
01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.140
SAM: Well, going back to what Essek said,

1967
01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:45.162
the members of the Assembly,

1968
01:28:45.162 --> 01:28:48.240
do we know all the members of the Assembly?

1969
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.730
LIAM: I mean, Caleb does. I would need to go through notes.

1970
01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:53.930
There's a lot of them.

1971
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:55.042
MARISHA: What if we go back to--

1972
01:28:55.042 --> 01:28:57.100
SAM: Should we start scrying on each one?

1973
01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:59.090
MARISHA: What if we go back to Yussa

1974
01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:01.220
Errenis in Nicodranas?

1975
01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:02.053
LIAM: Yussa?

1976
01:29:02.053 --> 01:29:03.277
MARISHA: Yussa.

1977
01:29:03.277 --> 01:29:04.110
SAM: What would he say?
TRAVIS: At the tower.

1978
01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:05.497
SAM: What would he know?

1979
01:29:05.497 --> 01:29:08.940
MARISHA: He's a sort of on-the-outs arcanist.

1980
01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:11.352
He might have--
LAURA: He doesn't like the Academy.

1981
01:29:11.352 --> 01:29:12.462
MARISHA: He doesn't like the Academy,

1982
01:29:12.462 --> 01:29:16.065
but you know how like all rich people know each other?

1983
01:29:16.065 --> 01:29:18.810
SAM: I do know that.
TALIESIN: You don't know that.

1984
01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:22.465
MARISHA: You know, he might've heard rumor.

1985
01:29:23.721 --> 01:29:25.050
LIAM: I don't really know--
SAM: Seems like we're closer--

1986
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:27.170
LIAM: --where his allegiances lie.
SAM: --to the thing than he is.

1987
01:29:27.170 --> 01:29:29.900
I mean, we've met in person

1988
01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.503
a lot of the people we're talking about.

1989
01:29:31.503 --> 01:29:33.690
LAURA: You know, somebody that seemed to have

1990
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:36.780
a lot of information about lots of different things.

1991
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:39.030
TALIESIN: If I had some incense and some ivory.

1992
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:40.413
LAURA: The Gentleman.

1993
01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.193
SAM: Papa?

1994
01:29:44.029 --> 01:29:44.970
TALIESIN: What?
LAURA: Potentially Papa.

1995
01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:47.100
You know, I mean he had his hands in--

1996
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.670
TRAVIS: He is well connected.
LAURA: --a lot of different things.

1997
01:29:48.670 --> 01:29:50.679
LIAM: That is true.
LAURA: He might have heard about

1998
01:29:50.679 --> 01:29:54.050
such a big artifact crossing the lines.

1999
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:55.460
MARISHA: Also--

2000
01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:56.800
TRAVIS: But he's back in--

2001
01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:57.990
LAURA: Zadash.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2002
01:29:57.990 --> 01:30:02.980
MARISHA: We have all these leads and this name Jagentoth

2003
01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:07.390
keep coming up and they tend to be expert smugglers.

2004
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:08.550
LAURA: That is true, too.

2005
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:11.020
MARISHA: If I was the Academy, I would try and distance

2006
01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:15.440
myself from any of this on my hands as much as I could.

2007
01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:19.290
LIAM: Well, they were in possession of one in Zadash.

2008
01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:22.820
MARISHA: Exactly, why couldn't they move the others?

2009
01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:24.200
LIAM: Well, they would, they are.

2010
01:30:25.230 --> 01:30:28.690
TRAVIS: The military is moving in Urzin, you said?

2011
01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:30.870
MATT: They're sending more military towards Urzin, yes.

2012
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:32.610
LIAM: But they would still be trying to use it

2013
01:30:32.610 --> 01:30:34.950
in the way they were using the one that we stole.

2014
01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:39.000
Experimenting with it.
MARISHA: Can you like

2015
01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:44.326
sense dunamagic now that you

2016
01:30:44.326 --> 01:30:45.617
have tapped into that?

2017
01:30:45.617 --> 01:30:46.770
LIAM: That's what you call it right, Essek?

2018
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:49.250
Sensing dunamagic?
MARISHA: Yeah, dunamagic.

2019
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:52.100
SAM: Are you talking about... jacking into the mainframe?

2020
01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:53.460
MARISHA: Yeah.

2021
01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.820
Can you do that?
LIAM: Love those glasses.

2022
01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:57.640
MATT: "It is referred to as dunamancy."

2023
01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.752
MARISHA: Yeah, dunamagic.

2024
01:30:59.752 --> 01:31:00.585
LIAM: Oh, boy.

2025
01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:03.850
MARISHA: I'm just shortening it.

2026
01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:06.191
TRAVIS: He just turned someone into a pretzel

2027
01:31:06.191 --> 01:31:07.766
with the dunamagic.

2028
01:31:07.766 --> 01:31:09.497
Tone it down.

2029
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:13.760
MATT: "It's fine, it is difficult for many to grasp its

2030
01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:18.320
"elaborate and esoteric depths."

2031
01:31:19.570 --> 01:31:22.500
MARISHA: I'm making a pun, you don't have to be patronizing.

2032
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.050
MATT: "But I always do."
MARISHA: That's true.

2033
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:26.650
TALIESIN: Puns by their very nature are.

2034
01:31:27.690 --> 01:31:30.680
I could meditate

2035
01:31:32.690 --> 01:31:33.810
upon the piece if I had,

2036
01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:38.770
I would need some incense and some ivory, but I could

2037
01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:41.290
maybe glean some information that we didn't have.

2038
01:31:41.290 --> 01:31:42.560
TRAVIS: That's not a bad idea.

2039
01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.960
I actually like Jester's idea of the Gentleman.

2040
01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.390
He is very well connected and if they're

2041
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:50.790
trying to move, albeit discretely through the Empire.

2042
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:52.820
LIAM: While I think that my good friend

2043
01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:55.440
Beauregard was being somewhat facetious,

2044
01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.590
it's not a bad point either, if there is any other

2045
01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:04.030
arcane tricks of your kind that

2046
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:08.225
you think would help us in our search.

2047
01:32:09.710 --> 01:32:11.243
Know that I,

2048
01:32:13.395 --> 01:32:17.110
I love my home. My home is out of control.

2049
01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:21.100
I want to end the conflict, I know

2050
01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:24.480
many here think that that is insanity. I do not.

2051
01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:28.428
And everything that I am learning here

2052
01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.698
I mean for the good of both our people.

2053
01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:37.520
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2054
01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.034
LAURA: I touch Caleb on the shoulder.

2055
01:32:40.034 --> 01:32:40.902
(laughter)

2056
01:32:40.902 --> 01:32:43.054
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Sneak it in there.

2057
01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.235
There it is.

2058
01:32:46.789 --> 01:32:47.688
LIAM: Adds a d4?

2059
01:32:47.688 --> 01:32:49.670
TALIESIN: Add a d4 to it.

2060
01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:52.035
LIAM: That is crazy cocked.

2061
01:32:52.035 --> 01:32:53.967
TRAVIS: Landed on your mountain.
LIAM: 22.

2062
01:32:53.967 --> 01:32:55.340
MARISHA: That's good shit.

2063
01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:57.556
MATT: 22, all righty.

2064
01:32:57.556 --> 01:32:59.240
LIAM: 18 plus four.

2065
01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.584
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Ooh, good four.

2066
01:33:00.584 --> 01:33:02.167
That's a good four.

2067
01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:07.760
MATT: "Gather your books."

2068
01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.200
LIAM: They are on me at all times.
MATT: "Good!

2069
01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.990
"Then to the den."

2070
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:16.430
SAM: All of us?

2071
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:17.890
MATT: "If you wish to watch, but I gather

2072
01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:20.870
"this might be a bit above your

2073
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:24.850
"respective levels of understanding."

2074
01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:26.090
TALIESIN: I have some shopping to do, personally.

2075
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:28.000
LAURA: Well, now I feel like he's just--

2076
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.150
MARISHA: Now he's laying it on thick.
LAURA: Yeah.

2077
01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:31.330
MATT: "I'm just being honest."

2078
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:34.050
TRAVIS: No, we could gather some things while they're doing this.

2079
01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:34.883
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll prep,

2080
01:33:34.883 --> 01:33:36.910
we've got our own notes and books we have to hit.

2081
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:37.870
TRAVIS: No, you don't.
MATT: "Perfect."

2082
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:39.712
MARISHA: Yes I do, yes I do!

2083
01:33:39.712 --> 01:33:42.815
As I punch your book in the fucking face, shut up.

2084
01:33:42.815 --> 01:33:46.110
SAM: We could go get some ivory, I guess, for you, Caducy.

2085
01:33:46.110 --> 01:33:48.680
TALIESIN: A little ivory and a little incense
would go a long way.

2086
01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:49.513
SAM: Okay.

2087
01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:51.990
MATT: All right.

2088
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:54.020

2089
01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:54.883
MATT: Okay.

2090
01:33:54.883 --> 01:33:58.170
TALIESIN: You earned it. You earned a show.

2091
01:33:58.170 --> 01:33:59.420
TRAVIS: The most boring show.

2092
01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.140
LAURA: I'm going to go make my popcorn in the kitchen

2093
01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:03.673
and I'm going to go sit down and watch them do it.

2094
01:34:03.673 --> 01:34:04.506
TALIESIN: Caramel corn.

2095
01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:07.106
TRAVIS: I'm going to go watch people study for the SAT.

2096

TRAVIS: Fuck.

2098
01:34:09.583 --> 01:34:11.700
LIAM: Were you referring to your den or ours?

2099
01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:15.730
MATT: "Yours."
LIAM: Ah, okay.

2100
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:18.470
MATT: "What is it you wish to do?

2101
01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.513

"do you enjoy the idea of

SAM: What?!

2109
01:34:49.410 --> 01:34:50.643
LIAM: That is intriguing.

2110
01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:52.803
How do you mean?

2111
01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:55.020
MATT: "Let me show you,"

2112
01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:58.302
and he pulls out a book from beneath the cloak.

2113
01:35:00.010 --> 01:35:02.770
I'm going to text you two spells.

2114
01:35:02.770 --> 01:35:04.590
I'm going to text you two spells

2115
01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:06.990
when we go on our break which will be just,

2116
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:08.642
I guess about now while we're doing this.

2118
01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:11.138
TRAVIS: I smell a shopping break.

2119
01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:12.813
MATT: Since it is nearly 8:40

2120
01:35:12.813 --> 01:35:14.170
and it seems like a good rest point

2121
01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:16.750
for us to take a quick break and then pick up from there.

2122
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:20.303
We'll be back here in just a minute as

2123
01:35:20.303 --> 01:35:23.430
the wizards convene and have a lesson.

2124
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:26.228

MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes.

2127
01:35:29.499 --> 01:35:30.332
In the meantime, we do have

2128
01:35:30.332 --> 01:35:33.927
our Wyrmwood giveaway this evening, tonight.

2129
01:35:33.927 --> 01:35:35.320
Oh, what?
LAURA: Is it one of the--

2130

LAURA: Good ones?

2131
01:35:36.153 --> 01:35:37.540
LIAM: Is it pretty?
MATT: Ah, it's so good.

2132
01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:40.737
All right, so this is the new, redesigned Hero Vaults

2133

amazing piece here.

This specifically is,

01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.773
I think it's the Purpleheart, right?

2139
01:35:51.773 --> 01:35:53.240
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Yep.

2140
01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:57.380
MATT: Purple wood, this is freaking cool looking.

2141
01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:00.130
One lucky person will have this

01:41:17.527 --> 01:41:22.527
"you can see the Shattered Temple of Zolgrux the Mad."

2240
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.860
BRIAN: Zolcrase, wait, what?

2241
01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:26.150
TRAVIS: Zolgrux?
BRIAN: Wait, what the fuck?

2242
01:41:26.150 --> 01:41:27.770
Zolgrux the Mad?

2243
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:28.900
What do I--
TRAVIS: Whoa!

2244
01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:31.696
Go get my--! Come get my-- I'm dying!

2245
01:41:31.696 --> 01:41:33.783
BRIAN: I tried to double, how do I double jump?

2246
01:41:33.783 --> 01:41:34.933
Nope, nope.

2247
01:41:35.969 --> 01:41:39.576
TRAVIS: (screams) Oh, I fucking missed him.

2248
01:41:39.576 --> 01:41:41.850
How are you supposed to miss that?

2249
01:41:42.892 --> 01:41:43.876
(speaking gibberish)

2250
01:41:43.876 --> 01:41:47.530
A game full of multiple levels when all you need is one

2251
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:49.640
to want to murder your entire neighborhood.

2252
01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:50.980
BRIAN: Yeah.

2253
01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:52.280
Yeah, exactly.

2254
01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.130
It's kind of like--

2255
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:57.050
TRAVIS: One and done.
BRIAN: Oh shit, oh god.

2256
01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:58.490
TRAVIS: I bet if we researched it, no one's ever

2257
01:41:58.490 --> 01:42:00.110
beat a single level of this game, I'm pretty sure.

2258
01:42:00.110 --> 01:42:02.710
BRIAN: I'm pretty sure. Max, can you look into that?

2259
01:42:02.710 --> 01:42:03.830
How do I double jump?

2260
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:05.460
TRAVIS: You know that in Contra--
BRIAN: I got a pinky.

2261
01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:07.630
TRAVIS: They made the first level passable.

2262
01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:09.630
BRIAN: I got a pinky.

2263
01:42:09.630 --> 01:42:10.900
TRAVIS: If we just stay here--

2264
01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.650
BRIAN: I don't think we're going to kill him, man.

2265
01:42:12.650 --> 01:42:15.583
BRIAN: No. Fuck, gimme, gimme, oh fuck, oh!

2266
01:42:15.583 --> 01:42:20.043
TRAVIS: (high-pitched screaming)

2267
01:42:21.650 --> 01:42:22.483
BRIAN: I got this.

2268
01:42:22.483 --> 01:42:24.410
TRAVIS: You'll take over the title if you can get it.

2269
01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:26.040
BRIAN: I got this, man.
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're there.

2270
01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.450
BRIAN: What is that?

2271
01:42:27.450 --> 01:42:29.870
What is that thing shooting at me?

2272
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:31.670
Fuck you, dude.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2273
01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:36.416
BRIAN: Oh, god.

2274
01:42:41.130 --> 01:42:43.870
TRAVIS: I think you're the new chosen one.

2275
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:46.460
BRIAN: That is all the time

2276
01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.048
we have for--

2277
01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:53.144
I mean I got a C minus but--
TRAVIS: A brand new record.

2278
01:42:53.144 --> 01:42:56.000
BRIAN: A brand new record.

2279
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.417
(intense ensemble music)

2280
01:43:29.193 --> 01:43:30.981
MATT: (groaning)

2281
01:43:30.981 --> 01:43:33.020
Oh.

2282
01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:35.810
Would you look at that, I think it worked.

2283
01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:38.019
You were right, Pumat number three.

2284
01:43:38.019 --> 01:43:41.840
All we had to do was invoke that subscription cantrip.

2285
01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:44.035
Pumat number three?

2286
01:43:46.243 --> 01:43:47.263
Oh boy.

2287
01:43:47.263 --> 01:43:50.110
Well, hello there, I'm Pumat Prime.

2288
01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:54.100
It's good to finally join you here in the Prime dimension.

2289
01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:58.350
I see this is the Twitch Prime realm I think and,

2290
01:43:59.190 --> 01:44:00.548
whoa,

2291
01:44:00.548 --> 01:44:02.390
we're on the Critical Role channel, aren't we?

2292
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:03.840
Well, would you look at that?

2293
01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:06.320
You got chat and everything.

2294
01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.840
Respectfully, I was looking

2295
01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:12.690
for the prime rib realm, but this isn't too bad.

2296
01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:14.900
You see, if you already have access

2297
01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:16.640
to the Amazon Prime realm, you can

2298
01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.550
get a free subscription to the channel

2299
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:20.850
of your choice in the Twitch Prime realm.

2300
01:44:20.850 --> 01:44:22.760
The two realms have a pretty good working

2301
01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:24.840
relationship after that peace treaty

2302
01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:27.760
the Prime Minister signed a few years back.

2303
01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.350
You just have to remember to renew your Twitch

2304
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:32.680
Prime subscription at the top of each month,

2305
01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.600
respectfully and hey, if you're already a subscriber,

2306
01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.390
you can spread the joy by gifting

2307
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:41.870
a subscription using the Gift a Sub button.

2308
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:44.050
That is, assuming the Empire hasn't

2309
01:44:44.050 --> 01:44:47.105
sent the tax man to your shop here recently.

2310
01:44:49.084 --> 01:44:50.270
All right, well off to find

2311
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:52.650
that darn elusive prime rib realm.

2312
01:44:52.650 --> 01:44:55.600
Who knew the Prime dimension had so many pockets?

2313
01:44:56.446 --> 01:44:57.279
Good luck.

2314
01:44:59.936 --> 01:45:01.486

Before we get into the game, we have a winner.

The winner of the awesome Wyrmwood

We'll be in contact with you

MATT: Just like that.

TRAVIS: Electronic music from your hacker-- okay.

2330
01:58:37.876 --> 01:58:40.800
LAURA: That's the kind of music that a hacker listens to.

2331
01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:45.200
MATT: So, Jester, as you're watching this inspection,

2332
01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:48.420
the glyphs are being shown, the pages are brought

2333
01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:50.720
one after the other and the instruction comes to Caleb.

2334
01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:54.540
The first spell in which Essek describes:

2335
01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:58.590
"There are ways which you can manipulate

2336
01:58:58.590 --> 01:59:01.890
"the gravity around specific objects

2337
01:59:01.890 --> 01:59:06.510
"to become a fixed point in space.

2338
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:09.490
"Like for instance," and he takes out a small,

2339
01:59:09.490 --> 01:59:11.460
it looks like a sack of some kind

2340
01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:14.080
and pools up some gold dust in his hand

2341
01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:17.070
and scatters it across one of the nearby chairs

2342
01:59:17.070 --> 01:59:18.778
and takes it and lifts it up

2343
01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:22.510
and he does a small series of finger motions

2344
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:24.990
that creates this slight spectral glyph.

2345
01:59:24.990 --> 01:59:29.990
The gold-like dust pulls towards the glyph and then (poof)

2346
01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:32.220
vanishes and he releases the chair

2347
01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:35.413
and the chair remains fixed in space.

2348
01:59:35.413 --> 01:59:37.663
(clapping)

2349
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:40.333
LIAM: I tug on it a little bit.

2350
01:59:40.333 --> 01:59:42.610
MATT: It does not budge at all.

2351
01:59:42.610 --> 01:59:44.697
LIAM: That is useful, yes, I know.

2352
01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:49.200
That is useful.

2353
01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:52.291
MATT: "It's a meager trick, but it has many

2354
01:59:52.291 --> 01:59:53.891
creative applications."

02:00:06.095 --> 02:00:09.090
"You're pretty strong; see if you can move it."

02:00:09.090 --> 02:00:10.310
LIAM: Yes, Jester.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2361
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:11.790
LIAM: Give it a tug.

2362
02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:13.905
LAURA: I'll give it the hardest tug I can.

2363
02:00:13.905 --> 02:00:15.479
MATT: Goddamn it.

2364
02:00:15.479 --> 02:00:18.512
Make a strength check.
LAURA: Can I dangle from it?

2365
02:00:18.512 --> 02:00:19.850
(laughter)

2366
02:00:19.850 --> 02:00:22.765
MATT: Yes, you may dangle from it as you tug.

2367
02:00:22.765 --> 02:00:24.123
TALIESIN: Wow, that tugging's--

2368
02:00:24.123 --> 02:00:26.890
LAURA: Can I give myself Guidance?

2369
02:00:26.890 --> 02:00:28.570
I'm a willing creature.

2370
02:00:28.570 --> 02:00:29.403
MATT: Sure.

2371
02:00:31.719 --> 02:00:33.994
TALIESIN: That was a dive bomb.
MARISHA: Is that real?

2372
02:00:33.994 --> 02:00:34.972
Is that real?
LAURA: It was.

2373
02:00:34.972 --> 02:00:36.216
MARISHA: Was it like yours?

2374
02:00:36.216 --> 02:00:37.441
That's sick.

2375
02:00:37.441 --> 02:00:39.790
LAURA: Oh, that's not good, 12.

2376
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:41.200
MATT: 12, it does not move at all.

2377
02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.380
You actually lift your entire body up off of this chair

2378
02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:46.710
that is just frozen in place there in the middle--

2379
02:00:46.710 --> 02:00:47.732
LAURA: This is really awesome!

2380
02:00:47.732 --> 02:00:49.450

2382
02:00:50.613 --> 02:00:52.280
MATT: It's at an angle, but you can do it--

2383
02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:53.780
LAURA: I'm going to hold onto the back of the chair.

2384
02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:56.193
MATT: So yeah.
LIAM: Is that comfortable?

2385
02:00:56.193 --> 02:00:59.050
LAURA: I mean, it's pretty cool.

2386
02:00:59.050 --> 02:01:00.630
It's worth it.

2387
02:01:00.630 --> 02:01:02.540
MATT: "It lasts for about--"
LAURA: You can't see it,

2388
02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:03.847
but my feet are kicking.

2389
02:01:03.847 --> 02:01:06.290
MATT: "It lasts for about an hour or
until you wish it to stop."

2390

He snaps and the chair (thudding)

2391
02:01:08.070 --> 02:01:09.940
onto the ground with Jester.

2392
02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:11.373
LAURA: (strained) Worth it.

2393
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:13.383
MATT: "So.

02:01:14.370 --> 02:01:16.261
"Hopefully this Immovable Object spell

2395
02:01:16.261 --> 02:01:18.394
will be useful to you."

2396
02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.980
LIAM: I can come up with a few applications for it, yes.

"I expect hopefully the same trust in return."

02:02:01.323 --> 02:02:05.347

02:02:05.347 --> 02:02:07.520
MATT: "I like that.

2411
02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.678
"Friends.

2412
02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:10.513
"So,

2413
02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:12.753
"time.

2414
02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:16.860
"When you move through it,

2415
02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:19.218
"from moment to moment, you make choices.

2416
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:22.530
"Each choice guides the next

2417
02:02:22.530 --> 02:02:25.163
"path of where this timeline will go.

2418
02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:29.090
"But when you make that choice,

2419
02:02:29.090 --> 02:02:32.843
"so many potential timelines are left to decay.

2420
02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:37.437
"So much potential lost to redistribute

2421
02:02:38.753 --> 02:02:40.443
"into the universe.

2422
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:46.080
"Why not put some of that unused potential to use?"

2423
02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.860
He procures a small piece of obsidian from inside

2424
02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:52.900
and draws this quick (swoosh) across the air

2425
02:02:52.900 --> 02:02:55.520
and you watch this line carve across

2426
02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:59.467
and where it does, it looks like shadow pours out of it,

2427
02:02:59.467 --> 02:03:02.857
but the shadow forms legs and a cloak.

2428
02:03:02.857 --> 02:03:04.250
(Laura gasps)

2429
02:03:04.250 --> 02:03:07.857
You see a black, shadowy,

2430
02:03:07.857 --> 02:03:11.954
spectral copy of Essek.

2431
02:03:11.954 --> 02:03:15.460
LAURA: That's like (gasps).

2432
02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:17.960
MATT: "These are referred to as echoes.

2433
02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.620
"They are

2434
02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:23.436
"potential selves left to fade in

2435
02:03:23.436 --> 02:03:26.361
"unrealized timelines.

2436
02:03:26.361 --> 02:03:27.630
"Some elements of dunamancy have

2437
02:03:27.630 --> 02:03:30.950
"allowed us the ability to call them.

2438
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:33.985
"After all, they are a piece of us.

2439
02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:38.930
"Why not make use of them before they are reabsorbed

2440
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:42.190
"by time and space?"

2441
02:03:43.090 --> 02:03:45.040
LIAM: That is fascinating.

2442
02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:48.065
I had some notion of this

2443
02:03:48.065 --> 02:03:52.280
being in contact with your beacon.

2444
02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:56.102
We had it for awhile and if you

2445
02:03:56.102 --> 02:03:57.390
spent time with it,

2446
02:03:57.390 --> 02:04:00.630
you sensed that very possibility.

2447
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:04.030
MATT: "Some of our elite warriors known as Echo Knights

2448
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:08.990
"specifically focus on this technique.

2449
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:11.558
"But us as practitioners of

2450
02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:13.780
"arcane arts,

2451
02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:15.430
"it's a little more specific.

2452
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:18.460
"For you see this version here contains

2453
02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:20.845
"a facet of my magical capabilities.

2454
02:04:22.248 --> 02:04:24.990
"It can cast one spell but when cast,

2455
02:04:26.010 --> 02:04:27.535
"it vanishes.

2456
02:04:29.050 --> 02:04:31.030
"And it can easily be destroyed as well.

2457
02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:35.200
"So, keep it safe."

2458
02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:37.000
LIAM: An even weaker wizard than I am.

2459
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:41.483
MATT: "Don't tell it that.

2460
02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:43.623
"But anyway,

2461
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:46.950
"come, I'll show you how to copy these down,"

2462
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:50.190
and these spells become now available to you.

2463
02:04:50.190 --> 02:04:54.670
The Resonant Echo spell and the Immovable Object spell.

2464
02:04:54.670 --> 02:04:56.540
LIAM: Hot dog.
TRAVIS: Shit.

2465
02:04:56.540 --> 02:04:58.348
LAURA: Can I practice them, too?

2466
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:02.616
MATT: "Sure."

2467
02:05:03.986 --> 02:05:05.700
He takes his book and hands it to you.

2468
02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:09.000
"Tell me, what of these particular

2469
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.325
glyphs can you ascertain connections?"

2470
02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:16.040
Make an arcana check.

2471
02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:17.230
TRAVIS: Come on.
LIAM: Roll high.

2472
02:05:17.230 --> 02:05:20.070
TRAVIS: Now is the time, now is the time.

2473
02:05:20.070 --> 02:05:21.930
LAURA: Guide me, Traveler.

2474
02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:24.393
LIAM: Commit to the bit.
LAURA: Fuck me running.

2475
02:05:24.393 --> 02:05:25.951
(laughter)

2476
02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:28.190
LAURA: (whispered) Fuck me running.

2477
02:05:28.190 --> 02:05:29.479
12.

2478
02:05:29.479 --> 02:05:31.460
A measly 12.

2479
02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:34.413
MATT: It looks like absolute gibberish to you on the page.

2480
02:05:34.413 --> 02:05:35.990
LAURA: Balls.

2481
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:37.448
MATT: "So what do you see?"

2482
02:05:40.110 --> 02:05:41.210
LAURA: I see

2483
02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:45.369
great peril

2484
02:05:45.369 --> 02:05:47.690
and

2485
02:05:47.690 --> 02:05:49.457
lots of time

2486
02:05:49.457 --> 02:05:52.797
changing and I see,

2487
02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:58.500
this little part kind of looks like a mouse and then

2488
02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:01.810
over here,

2489
02:06:01.810 --> 02:06:03.176
that's

2490
02:06:03.176 --> 02:06:05.650
definitely,

2491
02:06:05.650 --> 02:06:07.220
that's a tree, that's a tree

2492
02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:11.246
because you can see it's got this line right here and then--

2493
02:06:11.246 --> 02:06:12.838
MATT: Make a deception check.

2494
02:06:14.827 --> 02:06:16.815
LAURA: Oh, fuck me.

2495
02:06:16.815 --> 02:06:18.740
The dice hate me tonight.

2496
02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:21.670
I got a natural one.
TRAVIS: You didn't guide yourself.

2497
02:06:21.670 --> 02:06:23.120
LAURA: It wasn't worth it.

2498
02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:24.340
MATT: As you're pointing out the tree,

2499
02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:25.990
Essek slowly pulls the book away.

2500
02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:32.340
"I think we'll keep this between the learned individuals."

2501
02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:34.310
LAURA: I'm learned in other ways.

2502
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:35.460
MATT: "Of course you are."

2503
02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:38.930
LAURA: I could probably teach you some things, Essek.

2504
02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:39.990
MATT: "I--"

2505
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:41.570
LAURA: I bet I could.

2506
02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:44.000
MATT: "I'm certain you might, but I am not

2507
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.430
"particularly interested in what you have to teach.

2508
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:49.100
"Nevertheless," he takes the book back

2509
02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:50.925
and tucks it into the cloak.

2510
02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:54.053
"So,

2511
02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:57.518
"I will bid you goodbye.

2512
02:06:59.850 --> 02:07:02.298
"But remember, be careful.

2513
02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:08.882
"Echoes are definitely indicative of Dynasty

2514
02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:10.995
"abilities.

2515
02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:14.650
"It would be very easy for someone

2516
02:07:14.650 --> 02:07:18.447
"within the Empire to question your

2517
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:22.648
"allegiance, should you be carrying one out in the open."

2518
02:07:24.250 --> 02:07:28.150
LIAM: Why would they question my allegiance?

2519
02:07:28.150 --> 02:07:31.800
With discretion, I understand perfectly.

2520
02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:33.730
MATT: "Very well.

2521
02:07:33.730 --> 02:07:34.880
"Good luck."

2522
02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.955
LAURA: Thanks.
MATT: "And,

2523
02:07:36.955 --> 02:07:41.790
"remember, should you find the location of such a beacon,

2524
02:07:41.790 --> 02:07:43.427
"time is of the essence.

2525
02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:47.910
"All right, goodbye."

2526
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:49.170
LAURA: Hey, Essek.
MATT: "Mm-hmm?"

2527
02:07:49.170 --> 02:07:51.850
LAURA: Could you put that chair back in the air?

2528
02:07:51.850 --> 02:07:54.510
It's just really cool up there.

2529
02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:56.710
MATT: "Your friend Caleb is able to do that now.

2530
02:07:56.710 --> 02:07:59.560
"It is not inexpensive."

2531
02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:01.100
LAURA: Oh. Okay.

2532
02:08:02.488 --> 02:08:05.520
MATT: "Do you have 25 gold to pass along?"

2533
02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:06.850
LAURA: Well, I mean, yeah, but I don't know

2534
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:09.320
if a chair in the air is worth that.

2535
02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:11.387
MATT: "That's exactly what I mean.

2536
02:08:12.490 --> 02:08:15.250
"But if you can convince him.

2537
02:08:15.250 --> 02:08:16.941
"All right."

2538
02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:20.300
LIAM: <i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>.

2539
02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:22.410
MATT: He leaves you to your devices, but

2540
02:08:22.410 --> 02:08:27.410
with two more facets of dunamancy in your midst.

2541
02:08:27.415 --> 02:08:28.665
LIAM: (grunting)

2542
02:08:28.665 --> 02:08:30.110
TRAVIS: Fucking Timecop over here.

2543
02:08:30.110 --> 02:08:32.900
LAURA: I couldn't understand
what those glyphs actually meant.

2544
02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:36.507
I don't know if he thought that I did, but I didn't.

2545
02:08:36.507 --> 02:08:39.350
LIAM: Listen, you could've knocked
that guy's block off, Jester.

2546
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:41.150
I wouldn't try to compare.

2547
02:08:41.150 --> 02:08:43.170
LAURA: Not if he was using spells against me

2548
02:08:43.170 --> 02:08:44.952
at the time, I probably couldn't.

2549
02:08:44.952 --> 02:08:47.040
LIAM: I have seen you decimate a person

2550
02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:48.680
with a giant piece of confection.

2551
02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:52.090
I think that you can hold your own.

2552
02:08:52.090 --> 02:08:53.665
LAURA: Thanks, Caleb.

2553
02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:57.133
LIAM: It's an easy compliment to give.

2554
02:08:59.225 --> 02:09:01.844
LAURA: I walk up and I grab his hands.

2555
02:09:01.844 --> 02:09:04.152
I just want to say that

2556
02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:08.140
I know what you went through

2557
02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:10.880
today in the cell was very, very hard

2558
02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:18.008
and probably didn't go the way you were hoping it would.

2559
02:09:20.130 --> 02:09:21.920
So if you need anyone to talk to about it

2560
02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.132
or anything, I'm here for you, okay?

2561
02:09:32.132 --> 02:09:32.965
Okay.

2562
02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:36.003
You've got two new spells.

2563
02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:38.588
LIAM: So many more.

2564
02:09:41.882 --> 02:09:43.450
You're a good friend.

2565
02:09:43.450 --> 02:09:44.900
LAURA: So are you.

2566
02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:51.200
LIAM: Will you do a little bit
of boring shopping with me on the way back?

2567
02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:52.442
LAURA: Fuck yes.

2568
02:09:53.507 --> 02:09:54.490
LIAM: Okay.

2569
02:09:54.490 --> 02:09:56.590
Nothing complicated, I would look

2570
02:09:56.590 --> 02:09:59.700
for a place to buy chalk, gold dust,

2571
02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:03.560
paper and ink.
MATT: Okay.

2572
02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:05.330
Would you want a piece of obsidian as well?

2573
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:07.470
LIAM: Ah, thank you for the reminder, yeah.

2574
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:09.750
MATT: All right, so for the obsidian, it's 50 gold.

2575
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:11.742
LIAM: 50, all right.
MATT: And for the gold dust,

2576
02:10:11.742 --> 02:10:15.150
as much as you wish to purchase in equal amounts.

2577
02:10:15.150 --> 02:10:16.810
LIAM: 25 per?

2578
02:10:16.810 --> 02:10:18.970
MATT: Per casting, correct.
LIAM: Casting, yeah.

2579
02:10:18.970 --> 02:10:20.796
Okay.

2580
02:10:20.796 --> 02:10:23.855
LIAM: (speaking gibberish)
TRAVIS: (more gibberish)

2581
02:10:23.855 --> 02:10:26.784
LAURA: Wah wah wee wah. I can help.

2582
02:10:26.784 --> 02:10:29.843
LIAM: I'm close to broke, actually.

2583
02:10:29.843 --> 02:10:32.545
TRAVIS: Same as it ever was.
LIAM: Um, you know--

2584
02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:34.370
I've got it.

2585
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:36.690
I will spend the money on the obsidian

2586
02:10:36.690 --> 02:10:41.630
and 100 gold pieces worth of gold dust

2587
02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:44.240
and I will write them out when I am able to.

2588
02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:47.403
LAURA: I'm going to buy him some paper

2589
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:52.230
and I'm going to buy 50 gold worth of gold dust as well.

2590
02:10:52.230 --> 02:10:54.850
Just-- these are for special pranks

2591
02:10:54.850 --> 02:10:56.280
that I want you to cast, okay?

2592
02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:58.113
Like, I'm going to call in--
MATT: Oh no.

2593
02:10:58.113 --> 02:11:00.129
LARUA: -- a favor a couple times, I'm sure,

2594
02:11:00.129 --> 02:11:02.040
and I just want you to be prepared.
MATT: I didn't think even about that.

2595
02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:03.273
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2596
02:11:03.273 --> 02:11:04.397
LIAM: We did.

2597
02:11:04.397 --> 02:11:06.810
We definitely did.
MATT: What have I done?

2598
02:11:06.810 --> 02:11:08.750
LIAM: I will take this larger sack

2599
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:11.108
and I'm going to put it over here and tie it off.

2600
02:11:11.108 --> 02:11:12.600
MATT: This'll be interesting.

2601
02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:14.420
LIAM: So then your gold dust will go in here.

2602
02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:15.380
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: That's yours.

2603
02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:16.815
MATT: This is exactly what

2604
02:11:16.815 --> 02:11:19.230
the dunamancers of the world envisioned

2605
02:11:19.230 --> 02:11:21.096
with their various

2606
02:11:21.096 --> 02:11:22.696
space-bending secrets.
LAURA: ♪ This is why I wanted ♪

2607
02:11:22.696 --> 02:11:24.237
♪ to be there. ♪
SAM: Immovable dick.

2608
02:11:24.237 --> 02:11:28.514
LIAM: What is this rusty trombone and why won't it move?

2609
02:11:29.926 --> 02:11:31.720
LAURA: How much is the paper? What are you needing?

2610
02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:33.240
How much is paper that he wants?

2611
02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:35.800
LIAM: Oh gosh.
MATT: That would be his purview.

2612
02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:37.740
LAURA: How much do you need, what do you need?

2613
02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:41.220
LIAM: 50-- hold on.
MATT: 50 gold per level.

2614
02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:42.360
LIAM: Per level.
MATT: Yeah.

2615
02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:44.640
So you need 300 gold.
LIAM: 200.

2616
02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:46.648
LAURA: Okay, 300 gold.

2617
02:11:46.648 --> 02:11:48.100
MATT: That's for the paper and ink.

2618
02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:49.510
LAURA: Got it.

2619
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:51.863
LIAM: That is very generous of you.

2620
02:12:02.193 --> 02:12:03.530
I'll tell you later.

2621
02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:05.060
We should meet up with everybody.

2622
02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:06.510
LAURA: Okay.

2623
02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:08.900
TALIESIN: I will have wanted to buy 250 gold

2624
02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:11.400
worth of incense and 200 gold worth

2625
02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:14.270
of ivory strips if I can find such things in town.

2626
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:18.003
MATT: Yeah. It takes you a little bit, but you manage to

2627
02:12:18.003 --> 02:12:21.130
find what you need across, I'd say, three different shops.

2628
02:12:22.782 --> 02:12:24.393
But you manage to do so.
TALIESIN: Perfect.

2629
02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:27.920
MATT: Anybody else, anything?

2630
02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:31.530
SAM: Buy some lightweight but strong string,

2631
02:12:31.530 --> 02:12:33.332
like fishing

2632
02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:35.800
wire.
MATT: Yeah.

2633
02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:38.220
Fishing wire is available.

2634
02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:40.420
TRAVIS: Piano cord, fishing wire.

2635
02:12:40.420 --> 02:12:43.066
SAM: And then

2636
02:12:43.066 --> 02:12:47.550
like two ball bearings, but a little bigger than

2637
02:12:47.550 --> 02:12:50.800
like marble size.
LIAM: Big balls.

2638
02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:51.730
SAM: Yeah, big--

2639
02:12:51.730 --> 02:12:54.480
TRAVIS: Brass balls?
SAM: Minotaur balls.

2640
02:12:56.650 --> 02:12:57.630
TRAVIS: Those are like eggs.

2641
02:12:57.630 --> 02:12:59.600
SAM: Maybe not that--
MATT: Yeah.

2642
02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:02.168
I mean there are--
SAM: I'm trying to make like

2643
02:13:02.168 --> 02:13:04.230
a bolo-- is that what you call the thing?

2644
02:13:04.230 --> 02:13:05.700
MATT: A bola, yeah.

2645
02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:06.660
SAM: Bola.

2646
02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:08.554
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

2647
02:13:08.554 --> 02:13:09.866
TRAVIS: Bolo.

2648
02:13:09.866 --> 02:13:11.742
MATT: Bolo.

2649
02:13:11.742 --> 02:13:13.510
Ba--(mumbles).

2650
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:15.220
There are fishing weights, actually,

2651
02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:17.800
that are about the size that you need for that.

2652
02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:18.633
SAM: Okay.

2653
02:13:18.633 --> 02:13:20.840
MATT: You can get some cable, I wouldn't say--

2654
02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:21.973
you can probably get fishing line,

2655
02:13:21.973 --> 02:13:23.490
but it's not going to be very strong.

2656
02:13:23.490 --> 02:13:25.332
SAM: Whatever you think is right.

2657
02:13:25.332 --> 02:13:29.960
MATT: Wound cable has a little more tensile strength.

2658
02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:33.290
If you just want one set of--
you said two weights and one--?

2659
02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:35.790
SAM: How about two in case I fuck up.

2660
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:39.460
MATT: I'll say, because there's some custom knowledge to it,

2661
02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:41.070
I'd say five gold for the two.

2662
02:13:41.070 --> 02:13:42.403
SAM: Okay.

2663
02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:45.410
Great.

2664
02:13:45.410 --> 02:13:48.135
MATT: All right, anyone else, anything to do here?

2665
02:13:49.325 --> 02:13:50.933
MARISHA: Mm-mm.
MATT: Okay.

2666
02:13:50.933 --> 02:13:53.090
TRAVIS: Start reaching out and touching someone tonight.

2667
02:13:53.090 --> 02:13:53.923
MATT: All righty.

2668
02:13:55.890 --> 02:13:57.450
So,

2669
02:13:57.450 --> 02:14:00.100
while the night sky is ever present over Rosohna,

2670
02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:02.340
you assume and you know from just your general

2671
02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:06.250
awareness of time passage, though the constant

2672
02:14:06.250 --> 02:14:07.990
shifting of location does take you a little bit

2673
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:09.990
of adjustment from having to figure out where you are

2674
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:12.660
versus what time of day it is, especially in Rosohna.

2675
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:14.597
You gather the evening has come.

2676
02:14:14.597 --> 02:14:18.420
So the night, after a day of traversing,

2677
02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:21.020
investigating, conversations and learning,

2678
02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:23.230
the evening is here.

2679
02:14:23.230 --> 02:14:24.970
LAURA: Should I scry on some people?

2680
02:14:24.970 --> 02:14:26.430
SAM: For sure.

2681
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:29.390
So we should make a list of all the people

2682
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:31.057
we should scry on.
LAURA: Scry and chill?

2683
02:14:31.057 --> 02:14:32.190
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Good idea.

2684
02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:35.290
SAM: How many scrys do you got?
LAURA: I got two scrys.

2685
02:14:35.290 --> 02:14:36.600
SAM: Nobody else does it?

2686
02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:38.800
TALIESIN: I can after-- if I take a nap.

2687
02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:41.232
SAM: Like tomorrow.
TALIESIN: Tomorrow I can do it.

2688
02:14:41.232 --> 02:14:42.210
I have some stuff I can do today though.

2689
02:14:42.210 --> 02:14:43.890
SAM: Who's on our list?

2690
02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:45.300
We got the blond guy.

2691
02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:46.730
TRAVIS: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah.

2692
02:14:46.730 --> 02:14:50.225
SAM: We got Trent Ikithon.

2693
02:14:50.225 --> 02:14:51.210
LAURA: Yeah, I have a feeling he'd be

2694
02:14:51.210 --> 02:14:53.300
pretty hard to scry on, but I could try it.

2695
02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:55.302
SAM: We got--
TRAVIS: The Gentleman.

2696
02:14:55.302 --> 02:14:56.480
LAURA: We've got the Gentleman.

2697
02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:58.060
SAM: But we could just talk to him.

2698
02:14:58.060 --> 02:14:59.440
LAURA: Well yeah, but he could be lying.

2699
02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:01.460
TRAVIS: And he might not be where he last was.

2700
02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:03.190
SAM: But we can start by talking to him.

2701
02:15:03.190 --> 02:15:06.290
LAURA: We've got--
SAM: We've got Astrid.

2702
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:09.620
LIAM: Yes, I would be curious.

2703
02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:11.830
That's probably not going to work,

2704
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:15.220
but I would be curious to see-- the same with Trent.

2705
02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:17.470
It would be an experiment with very--

2706
02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:19.650
LAURA: Could you disguise yourself?

2707
02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:20.970
Could you make yourself look like her

2708
02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:23.753
so I would know exactly what she looks like?

2709
02:15:25.078 --> 02:15:26.311
TALIESIN: That's--

2710
02:15:26.311 --> 02:15:28.008
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Clever.

2711
02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:30.580
SAM: We also got--

2712
02:15:31.807 --> 02:15:33.727
TRAVIS: The Laughing Hand, Yasha.

2713
02:15:33.727 --> 02:15:34.640
MARISHA: Yasha.

2714
02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:36.715
SAM: Vess DeRogna.

2715
02:15:38.190 --> 02:15:39.490
These are other--

2716
02:15:39.490 --> 02:15:40.773
LIAM: There are quite a few of them.

2717
02:15:40.773 --> 02:15:43.814
SAM: Martinet Ludinus Da'leth.

2718
02:15:43.814 --> 02:15:45.997
LIAM: Trent Ikithon.
TALIESIN: Didn't occur to me until just now,

2719
02:15:45.997 --> 02:15:47.963
we have pissed off a lot of people.

2720
02:15:47.963 --> 02:15:49.363
LIAM: Ludinus Da'leth is in charge.

2721
02:15:49.363 --> 02:15:50.196
SAM: What did you say, Ludinus--?

2722
02:15:50.196 --> 02:15:53.260
LIAM: Ludinus Da'leth, Martinet Ludinus Da'leth.

2723
02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:56.140
SAM: Ludinus Da'leth and then there was--

2724
02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:58.550
MARISHA: Your other friend.
LIAM: Here we go, there is--

2725
02:15:58.550 --> 02:16:00.250
SAM: Vess DeRogna.

2726
02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:05.700
LIAM: Yes, Vess DeRogna, Archmage of Antiquity.

2727
02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:09.502
There is Lord Athesias Uludan.

2728
02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:14.400
Master Doolan Tversky.

2729
02:16:15.447 --> 02:16:16.580
LAURA: There's a lot in the Academy members.

2730
02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:17.413
Aren't they all going to be

2731
02:16:17.413 --> 02:16:19.248
pretty guarded as far as this goes?

2732
02:16:19.248 --> 02:16:22.660
I imagine their blocking capabilities

2733
02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:25.810
might be higher than my scrying capabilities.

2734
02:16:25.810 --> 02:16:27.130
SAM: Maybe.
LAURA: I don't know.

2735
02:16:27.130 --> 02:16:29.810
TALIESIN: Hard to get a handle on.

2736
02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:33.380
LIAM: There are eight positions that rule the Assembly

2737
02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:36.906
and then beneath them, somebody's--

2738
02:16:36.906 --> 02:16:38.320
what's the right word?

2739
02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.500
Deputized is not it,

2740
02:16:39.500 --> 02:16:42.860
they are what are referred to as Annexes.

2741
02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:44.400
They have a lot of responsibility,

2742
02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:47.690
but there are eight at the top, always.

2743
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:51.120
When one of them is no longer for this world,

2744
02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:55.018
they either bequeath it to one of their children

2745
02:16:55.018 --> 02:16:57.851
or it is handed off to someone deemed worthy.

2746
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:59.965
LAURA: Okay.

2747
02:16:59.965 --> 02:17:03.730
MARISHA: So they only pass off power when they die?

2748
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:06.413
LAURA: So they're pretty old, all of them?

2749
02:17:06.413 --> 02:17:08.860
LIAM: Not all of them.

2750
02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:11.690
MARISHA: It feels like their interest in dunamancy

2751
02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:13.850
makes a lot more sense.
LIAM: Jenna Iresor,

2752
02:17:13.850 --> 02:17:17.153
Archmage of Industry is younger.

2753
02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:20.120
She handles business.

2754
02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:21.860
SAM: We've seen her, no, we've heard of her.

2755
02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:25.070
We saw her in Felderwin?

2756
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:26.620
Maybe not.

2757
02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:28.150
LIAM: It's been a long time in-game.

2758
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:30.080
I feel like we came into contact

2759
02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:32.170
with Oremid Hass or heard of Oremid Hass.

2760
02:17:32.170 --> 02:17:35.460
MATT: Oremid Hass you came in contact with briefly at the--

2761
02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:39.340
If I recall, you saw him

2762
02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:42.750
at the tournament where you guys battled

2763
02:17:42.750 --> 02:17:44.600
in the center during the festival.

2764
02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:46.130
LIAM: I'm actually looking at that just--

2765
02:17:46.130 --> 02:17:49.731
LIAM: We heard about Vess DeRogna when we were--

2766
02:17:49.731 --> 02:17:51.830
MATT: You saw her in Felderwin.

2767
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:52.960
LIAM: With the dude in charge.

2768
02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.210
MATT: Yes, with Ludinus Da'leth.

2769
02:17:54.210 --> 02:17:55.820
LIAM: Ludinus Da'leth and--

2770
02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:56.710
LAURA: Yeah.

2771
02:17:56.710 --> 02:17:58.240
LIAM: DeRogna's the Archmage of Antiquity.

2772
02:17:58.240 --> 02:17:59.560
She would've been the one who would've

2773
02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:02.350
understood or known what the beacon was.

2774
02:18:02.350 --> 02:18:03.830
MATT: Supposed to be closest.
LIAM: Could be,

2775
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:06.370
could be the person who had the tripod.

2776
02:18:06.370 --> 02:18:07.990
She knows about--

2777
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.990
LAURA: We need to check out that tripod.

2778
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:10.300
You know we've never checked it out?

2779
02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:12.431
SAM: What do you mean checked it out, just like look at it?

2780
02:18:12.431 --> 02:18:15.490
LAURA: Yeah, we've never fully inspected it, have we?

2781
02:18:15.490 --> 02:18:17.270
TRAVIS: I think we identified it.

2782
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:19.090
SAM: We could, maybe we could ascertain

2783
02:18:19.090 --> 02:18:22.390
where the metal comes from or how it was made.

2784
02:18:22.390 --> 02:18:23.680
LAURA: Can we pull out the tripod?

2785
02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:25.580
LIAM: Yeah, let's do that.

2786
02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:28.980
TRAVIS: We never talked to your husband about the tripod?

2787
02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:30.700
LAURA: No.
SAM: Oops!

2788
02:18:32.210 --> 02:18:33.790
LAURA: We never did.

2789
02:18:33.790 --> 02:18:35.460
SAM: We could also do that.

2790
02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:37.020
LAURA: I could send a message to him.

2791
02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:39.117
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.
LAURA: Okay.

2792
02:18:39.117 --> 02:18:40.870
SAM: I'm adding him to the list.

2793
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:43.310
TALIESIN: A message, which is much easier than scrying.

2794
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:44.600
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2795
02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:47.220
Should I begin a ritual

2796
02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:49.200
for this, for

2797
02:18:50.762 --> 02:18:52.730
the Luxon?

2798
02:18:52.730 --> 02:18:54.430
SAM: What ritual?

2799
02:18:54.430 --> 02:18:56.540
LAURA: Oh, so you can find out some stuff about it, yeah?

2800
02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:59.730
TALIESIN: I can ask the Wildmother to tell me as much about,

2801
02:18:59.730 --> 02:19:02.100
we've never really delved deep

2802
02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:04.650
into what it is or what it can do.

2803
02:19:04.650 --> 02:19:06.370
LIAM: We need all the information we can get.

2804
02:19:06.370 --> 02:19:07.550
TALIESIN: This might be a good start.

2805
02:19:07.550 --> 02:19:11.074
LIAM: It's a wonderful suggestion, Caduceus.

2806
02:19:11.074 --> 02:19:13.060
SAM: You know, Jester, this feels a lot

2807
02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:14.740
like a good old fashioned mystery.

2808
02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:17.080
LAURA: It really does.

2809
02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:19.940
We just have to gather up the clues and the evidence

2810
02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:21.730
and then we will find exactly what we're looking for.

2811
02:19:21.730 --> 02:19:24.930
SAM: And then question the suspects.

2812
02:19:24.930 --> 02:19:27.205
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: And one'll crack.

2813
02:19:27.205 --> 02:19:28.273
TALIESIN: It's very impressive that you've learned

2814
02:19:28.273 --> 02:19:30.690
to meditate in this crowd. It's not easy.

2815
02:19:30.690 --> 02:19:33.820
LAURA: The beacon will be ours.

2816
02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:36.390
TALIESIN: I am going to begin lighting,

2817
02:19:36.390 --> 02:19:39.000
making a little corner and beginning Legend Lore.

2818
02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:39.990
MATT: Legend Lore, okay.

2819
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:42.543
TRAVIS: Can I assist you in some way?

2820
02:19:42.543 --> 02:19:45.680
TALIESIN: You could get everyone to quiet down a bit.

2821
02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:47.210
TRAVIS: Everyone, shut the fuck up.

2822
02:19:47.210 --> 02:19:49.610
SAM: See, see, vow of silence right there.

2823
02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:51.432
He's already doing it.

2824
02:19:53.580 --> 02:19:54.413
MATT: Okay.

2825
02:19:54.413 --> 02:19:55.246
So,

2826
02:19:56.232 --> 02:19:57.930
it takes you a brief moment to set up.

2827
02:19:57.930 --> 02:19:59.380
It's not extremely extensive.

2828
02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:03.860
The incense is consumed at the moment

2829
02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:06.760
of invoking the Legend Lore spell.

2830
02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:09.070
You watch Caduceus' eyes go wide

2831
02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:12.430
and suddenly the irises are just clouded over.

2832
02:20:12.430 --> 02:20:13.830
At first, you look snow blind,

2833
02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:15.310
but you can see a slight movement,

2834
02:20:15.310 --> 02:20:18.510
like there's some sort of a shifting fog within the eye.

2835
02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:20.410
LAURA: I'm drawing the shit out of Caduceus right now.

2836
02:20:20.410 --> 02:20:21.940
MATT: All righty.

2837
02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:23.210
You are asking about

2838
02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:25.360
The Luxon.

2839
02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:27.835
TALIESIN: Specifically and

2840
02:20:27.835 --> 02:20:30.385
especially the one that we're missing.

2841
02:20:30.385 --> 02:20:31.800
MATT: Okay.

2842
02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:33.910
TALIESIN: The other of the pair.

2843
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:34.920
MATT: The one that you're looking for?

2844
02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:36.980
TALIESIN: Yes.

2845
02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:38.300
MATT: The one that you're looking for,

2846
02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:41.950
that beacon is one of many,

2847
02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:44.650
of which only a few have been found.

2848
02:20:46.430 --> 02:20:51.341
This was uncovered probably 700 years ago.

2849
02:20:51.341 --> 02:20:55.250
TALIESIN: 700.

2850
02:20:55.250 --> 02:20:56.490
MATT: And was

2851
02:20:56.490 --> 02:20:57.930
carved

2852
02:20:57.930 --> 02:20:59.660
out of

2853
02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:01.827
what is now known as Blightshore

2854
02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:04.750
from the Penumbra Range

2855
02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:08.825
that divides Blightshore and Xhorhas.

2856
02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:13.950
This beacon, like many

2857
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:16.642
are considered to be parts of the Luxon.

2858
02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:22.860
Remnants left behind of some light being pre-history.

2859
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:29.400
Each one of these legendary objects

2860
02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:32.672
contains within it much potential.

2861
02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:36.570
It contains the prospect of

2862
02:21:37.780 --> 02:21:39.724
time,

2863
02:21:39.724 --> 02:21:42.688
the prospect of decision,

2864
02:21:42.688 --> 02:21:46.087
of destinies and breaking them

2865
02:21:47.710 --> 02:21:49.720
and those who bind themselves to the Luxon

2866
02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:53.897
through the beacon find themselves brought into

2867
02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:58.847
the ever-spinning cycle of rebirth.

2868
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:06.870
TALIESIN: No stories of this particular object,

2869
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:09.580
of where it's been, who's been in contact with it?

2870
02:22:10.450 --> 02:22:12.700
MATT: Many figures have been in contact with it.

2871
02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:16.170
The Bright Queen, through two different lives.

2872
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:22.830
It has seen open worship on days of chosen sunlight

2873
02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:27.180
in which the nightfall is dispelled and the people

2874
02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:31.300
of Rosohna and Xhorhas bask in the sun.

2875
02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:36.300
Even those who find pain and challenge in its presence,

2876
02:22:36.310 --> 02:22:38.390
as it is part of the worship.

2877
02:22:38.390 --> 02:22:39.748
You've seen it

2878
02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:43.132
grasped

2879
02:22:43.132 --> 02:22:45.607
and ushered out in the night

2880
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:49.205
and given to

2881
02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:53.345
figures who are not meant to hold it.

2882
02:22:53.345 --> 02:22:56.845
TALIESIN: How long ago, can I tell how long ago,

2883
02:22:56.845 --> 02:23:00.280
for how long it's been in other hands?

2884
02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:01.946
I know.
MATT: It's not

2885
02:23:01.946 --> 02:23:03.900
really of legendary importance. I would say no.

2886
02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:06.010
TALIESIN: Fair.
MATT: You get brief images of just

2887
02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:09.510
the timeline that it has tumbled through

2888
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:11.140
and that's about as much as you can grasp.

2889
02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:11.973
Unfortunately, a lot of

2890
02:23:11.973 --> 02:23:13.473
the information you already knew.

2891
02:23:13.473 --> 02:23:15.060
TALIESIN: That's okay, it's nice to have

2892
02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:18.340
some confirmed timeline and it's nice to have--

2893
02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:19.173
TRAVIS: Location to start.

2894
02:23:19.173 --> 02:23:21.800
TALIESIN: We also know that there's more than two.

2895
02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:22.810
LAURA: Yeah, we knew that already.

2896
02:23:22.810 --> 02:23:24.380
TALIESIN: I guess we did know that already.

2897
02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:26.120
That's fair.

2898
02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:29.500
At the end, we also know where it was made.

2899
02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:31.120
MARISHA: Blightshore?

2900
02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:33.829
TALIESIN: Blightshore and Xhorhas.

2901
02:23:33.829 --> 02:23:34.995
LAURA: The Penumbra Range.

2902
02:23:34.995 --> 02:23:35.828
TALIESIN: Penumbra.

2903
02:23:35.828 --> 02:23:37.370
LIAM: Is Blightshore the name of a mountain?

2904
02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:39.220
MATT: The Penumbra Range is actually

2905
02:23:39.220 --> 02:23:42.700
the mountain range on the eastern side of Xhorhas.

2906
02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:45.730
LIAM: Blightshore is a mountain there, or?

2907
02:23:45.730 --> 02:23:47.120
MATT: From what you ascertained,

2908
02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:49.120
it was found somewhere near the base

2909
02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:51.420
of the mountain range on the Blightshore side,

2910
02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:54.420
which is the eastern land to Xhorhas.

2911
02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:56.010
It's also known as the Miskath Strand,

2912
02:23:56.010 --> 02:23:57.440
that's its classic historical name,

2913
02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:00.333
but Blightshore is what it's called since the Calamity.

2914
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:03.403
TALIESIN: Interesting.

2915
02:24:04.740 --> 02:24:07.065
Well, if it was 700 years ago,

2916
02:24:07.065 --> 02:24:11.237
then it was probably not the Blightshore quite yet.

2917
02:24:11.237 --> 02:24:14.030
MATT: It would have been shortly after the Calamity.

2918
02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:16.030
The Calamity was over 800 years ago.

2919
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:20.360
TALIESIN: All right, all right.

2920
02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:23.675
Well, that's a start.

2921
02:24:26.610 --> 02:24:29.530
SAM: Well, let's start the scry parade, shall we?

2922
02:24:29.530 --> 02:24:30.620
LAURA: Yeah, who should I start with?

2923
02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:32.697
SAM: Caleb, this is really--

2924
02:24:32.697 --> 02:24:34.197
LAURA: Do you want, ooh, ooh, ooh,

2925
02:24:34.197 --> 02:24:37.150
do you want me to send a message to Yeza first, Yeza?

2926
02:24:37.150 --> 02:24:39.120
SAM: Okay, well if we're going to do that,

2927
02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:43.290
we're going to ask him where did the tripod come from,

2928
02:24:43.290 --> 02:24:44.250
who gave it to him?

2929
02:24:44.250 --> 02:24:45.960
TRAVIS: What's it made of?

2930
02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:46.793
SAM: Well.

2931
02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:50.380
TALIESIN: How about everything he can
tell us about the tripod.

2932
02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:53.570
SAM: In 25 words.
TALIESIN: In 25 words.

2933
02:24:53.570 --> 02:24:57.750
SAM: Where did it come from, who gave it to him?

2934
02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:59.200
LAURA: What's it for?

2935
02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:02.740
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Do we know what it's for?

2936
02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:04.790
SAM: It's for holding the--
LAURA: Yeah, but--

2937
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:06.450
TRAVIS: Amplifying maybe.

2938
02:25:06.450 --> 02:25:07.720
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Why not four feet?

2939
02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:11.990
TRAVIS: They we're also trying to create, anyway.

2940
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:14.720
MARISHA: Like siphons.
LAURA: Udders.

2941
02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:18.060
Dunamancy udders.
SAM: Oh wow.

2942
02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:19.990
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Secrete time.

2943
02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:22.190
TALIESIN: It's dairy-mancy.
LAURA: Got to milk the time.

2944
02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:25.452
LIAM: I remember dunamancy.

2945
02:25:26.825 --> 02:25:28.219
TALIESIN: Caleb remembers.

2946
02:25:28.219 --> 02:25:30.466
(laughter)

2947
02:25:30.466 --> 02:25:31.550
SAM: So,

2948
02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:33.020
25 words.
LAURA: Yes.

2949
02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:34.330
SAM: We're safe.

2950
02:25:34.330 --> 02:25:35.163
LAURA: We're safe.

2951
02:25:35.163 --> 02:25:36.630
SAM: Question.

2952
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:37.940
LAURA: Question, question.

2953
02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:41.170
SAM: Where was tripod

2954
02:25:41.170 --> 02:25:42.003
made?

2955
02:25:42.003 --> 02:25:44.617
TRAVIS: Don't plan, just go for it.
SAM: Who gave to you?

2956
02:25:44.617 --> 02:25:47.540
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Yeza, stop it.

2957
02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:48.373
MATT: Okay.

2958
02:25:48.373 --> 02:25:52.013
SAM: Just omit all the verbs, talk like a cave man.

2959
02:25:55.273 --> 02:25:57.308
LAURA: Hey, we're safe.
SAM: No.

2960
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:02.368
LAURA: Tripod.

2961
02:26:03.430 --> 02:26:05.360
Who made?

2962
02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:07.073
Where from?

2963
02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:11.758
What for?

2964
02:26:11.758 --> 02:26:14.008
(laughter)

2965
02:26:17.406 --> 02:26:19.047
SAM: Fire bad.

2966
02:26:22.865 --> 02:26:24.320
MARISHA: How's Luc?

2967
02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:26.430
LAURA: How's Luc?

2968
02:26:26.430 --> 02:26:29.070
TRAVIS: Don't waste that shit.

2969
02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:33.270
SAM: Be brief in your responses.

2970
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:35.661
You can tell him that too, right?

2971
02:26:35.661 --> 02:26:40.161
LAURA: You've got 25 words to respond to this message.

2972
02:26:40.161 --> 02:26:41.461
Poop.

2973
02:26:43.450 --> 02:26:45.100
SAM: Oh, there's one more.

2974
02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:50.967
MATT: I love this spell so much.

2975
02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:55.452
LAURA: So we beat a dragon up.

2976
02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:02.070
MATT: "Wow."

2977
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:03.328
TRAVIS: "Poop."

2978
02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:06.620
MATT: "I am

2979
02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:08.353
"confused."

2980
02:27:09.599 --> 02:27:11.394
LAURA: He's wasting some of it.
MATT: "Luc is fine."

2981
02:27:11.394 --> 02:27:14.441
LAURA: Luc is good.
SAM: I mean, that's good, but...

2982
02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:19.305
MATT: "A dragon's a lot.

2983
02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:25.390
"I'm not sure

2984
02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:27.962
"I know

2985
02:27:27.962 --> 02:27:30.930
"what you meant.

2986
02:27:30.930 --> 02:27:32.677
"Tripod?"

2987
02:27:32.677 --> 02:27:33.510
And that's it.

2988
02:27:34.748 --> 02:27:37.120
LAURA: He doesn't know what a tripod is.

2989
02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:39.890
Let's pull it out, is this a tripod?

2990
02:27:39.890 --> 02:27:41.580
SAM: Pull it out, wait, who has it?

2991
02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:42.413
You have it.

2992
02:27:42.413 --> 02:27:44.170
MARISHA: It's in the Bag of Holding.

2993
02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:47.630
LAURA: He has it.

2994
02:27:47.630 --> 02:27:49.317
TALIESIN: Thup, thup, thup, thup.

2995
02:27:49.317 --> 02:27:52.080
MATT: It is, it's a platinum tripod and it has a couple of--

2996
02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:54.175
MARISHA: It's platinum?

2997
02:27:54.175 --> 02:27:55.479
LAURA: This whole thing is platinum?

2998
02:27:55.479 --> 02:27:58.760
MARISHA: We've been fucking sitting on platinum!

2999
02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:00.253
LAURA: Okay, keep going.

3000
02:28:00.253 --> 02:28:01.872
MARISHA: Sorry.

3001
02:28:01.872 --> 02:28:03.560
MARISHA: It is lighter than you'd expect

3002
02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:05.655
a solid platinum tripod to be.

3003
02:28:05.655 --> 02:28:07.096
LAURA: Okay.

3004
02:28:08.072 --> 02:28:10.290
MARISHA: Does it, is this magical?

3005
02:28:10.290 --> 02:28:11.123
LAURA: Let him keep going.

3006
02:28:11.123 --> 02:28:15.260
SAM: Let him finish his sentence.
MARISHA: Sorry.

3007
02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:17.540
MATT: The top of it, it has, it's like,

3008
02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:20.070
the triangular portion where the three pieces come together,

3009
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:22.030
there are protrusions that look like they were

3010
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:25.900
in place to hold where the beacon would settle into,

3011
02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:27.610
what the handles would rest on

3012
02:28:27.610 --> 02:28:30.220
and where the bottom part of it would be held.

3013
02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:34.260
So it had multiple points of contact to keep it in place.

3014
02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:36.330
It looked like there were a couple

3015
02:28:36.330 --> 02:28:37.830
of other small mechanisms beneath it

3016
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:41.340
where things could be affixed, whether it be,

3017
02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:43.390
you actually as an alchemist recognize there are portions

3018
02:28:43.390 --> 02:28:45.450
at the bottom where it looks like you would affix

3019
02:28:45.450 --> 02:28:49.070
vials or jars or things that would gather and collect--

3020
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:52.590
LAURA: Oh, it's a milking device. It really is.

3021
02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:54.780
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3022
02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:56.460
MATT: That's the best you can ascertain.

3023
02:28:56.460 --> 02:28:59.170
SAM: So if he didn't know about it.

3024
02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:02.100
LAURA: Maybe he just didn't remember

3025
02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:03.450
that I was talking about that tripod.

3026
02:29:03.450 --> 02:29:04.480
I mean, it is kind of--

3027
02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:06.260
SAM: You should've been more specific.

3028
02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:08.161
LAURA: <i>Nott.</i>

3029
02:29:08.161 --> 02:29:10.860
(laughter)

3030
02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:12.830
SAM: I'm just, this is one detective to another.

3031
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:15.140
It's constructive criticism.

3032
02:29:15.140 --> 02:29:16.175
All right, who's next?

3033
02:29:20.396 --> 02:29:23.740
MATT: My instinct was to hide
and then run away from the scene.

3034
02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:28.188
MARISHA: Wait, is it magical, though?

3035
02:29:28.188 --> 02:29:29.750
I still want an answer to that question.

3036
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:31.431
LIAM: I take the tripod and I put it down.

3037
02:29:31.431 --> 02:29:33.060
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.

3038
02:29:33.060 --> 02:29:34.390
MATT: It is not magical.

3039
02:29:34.390 --> 02:29:36.040
LAURA: It's not magical.

3040
02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:37.850
TRAVIS: It's money.

3041
02:29:37.850 --> 02:29:39.205
MARISHA: Yeah.

3042
02:29:39.205 --> 02:29:41.170
LAURA: It seems light for platinum, though.

3043
02:29:41.170 --> 02:29:42.890
MARISHA: Can I--
LAURA: Is it hollow?

3044
02:29:42.890 --> 02:29:45.060
MARISHA: Yeah, is it hollow?
MATT: It's hollow.

3045
02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:46.040
MARISHA: Can I--

3046
02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:47.770
TRAVIS: Then it's less money.

3047
02:29:47.770 --> 02:29:49.520
MARISHA: I want to take it, and I want to

3048
02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:51.686
whack it against the ground.

3049
02:29:51.686 --> 02:29:54.190
MATT: Okay, make a strength check.

3050
02:29:54.190 --> 02:29:56.790
MARISHA: Just a strength check?
TALIESIN: You're going to break it.

3051
02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:58.130
MARISHA: Goddammit.

3052
02:29:58.130 --> 02:30:00.290
LIAM: That's another three,
that's the third time she's done that.

3053
02:30:00.290 --> 02:30:01.970
LAURA: Are you rolling with the same dice every time?

3054
02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:02.990
TRAVIS: This is the second time.
MARISHA: Yes.

3055
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:04.360
LIAM: Yes, she is.
MARISHA: I am.

3056
02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:05.590
TALIESIN: Perhaps the d3.

3057
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:07.470
MARISHA: Just a strength check, three.

3058
02:30:07.470 --> 02:30:09.080
MATT: Three, okay.

3059
02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:11.940
You don't bend it, you don't permanently damage it.

3060
02:30:11.940 --> 02:30:13.777
It hits the ground, (boof) you hear

3061
02:30:13.777 --> 02:30:15.710
the hollow tube element

3062
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:18.100
at the center of the side that impacts.

3063
02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:19.940
TALIESIN: It's collapsible, right?

3064
02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:22.159
MATT: Somewhat, yeah, like there's two pieces--

3065
02:30:22.159 --> 02:30:24.190
MARISHA: Are you getting the same idea I'm getting?

3066
02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:25.906
TALIESIN: No, probably not.

3067
02:30:25.906 --> 02:30:27.662
(laughter)

3068
02:30:27.662 --> 02:30:29.713
MARISHA: Shit, I'm not talking to Percy anymore.
TALIESIN: No.

3069
02:30:30.850 --> 02:30:32.718
TRAVIS: "No, probably not."

3070
02:30:35.491 --> 02:30:36.324
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: All right.

3071
02:30:36.324 --> 02:30:37.840
Stay on task, stay on task.

3072
02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:39.316
It's not about the tripod.

3073
02:30:39.316 --> 02:30:40.800
MARISHA: It could be a cool new weapon.

3074
02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:42.190
LAURA: Scrying.

3075
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:45.250
TRAVIS: The Penumbra Range is not far from where we are

3076
02:30:45.250 --> 02:30:47.350
and on our map, there are these little islands

3077
02:30:47.350 --> 02:30:50.242
out in the lake that have runes on them.

3078
02:30:50.242 --> 02:30:52.290
I don't know if that matters or not.

3079
02:30:52.290 --> 02:30:53.714
LIAM: We've read those.
MARISHA: We've read those.

3080
02:30:53.714 --> 02:30:55.860
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

3081
02:30:57.060 --> 02:30:59.220
LAURA: We could maybe go to the mountain range

3082
02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:02.500
and just find another beacon in the range.

3083
02:31:03.410 --> 02:31:06.460
TALIESIN: Let's prod a bit more before we get there.

3084
02:31:06.460 --> 02:31:09.850
LIAM: We're going to--
SAM: You mean like someone who

3085
02:31:09.850 --> 02:31:12.360
is watching someone else's cat and it dies and you go

3086
02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:14.710
to a pet store and get a cat that's the same color--

3087
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:16.003
LAURA: Yeah.

3088
02:31:16.003 --> 02:31:16.836
SAM: And bring it to the person?

3089
02:31:16.836 --> 02:31:17.770
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: People do that?

3090
02:31:17.770 --> 02:31:20.130
SAM: Well, I-- you know, yeah.

3091
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:21.170
TALIESIN: Wow.

3092
02:31:21.170 --> 02:31:22.403
That's dark.

3093
02:31:23.470 --> 02:31:25.205
LAURA: Have you ever done that?

3094
02:31:25.205 --> 02:31:27.640
TRAVIS: Are you talking about the plot to Meet the Fockers?

3095
02:31:27.640 --> 02:31:31.260
LIAM: We're going to try to scry on someone.

3096
02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:32.510
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: Okay.

3097
02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:35.420
Do you know who you would prefer to start with?

3098
02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:36.253
LAURA: No.

3099
02:31:36.253 --> 02:31:37.390
SAM: Someone that we've seen would

3100
02:31:37.390 --> 02:31:38.970
probably be the most successful.

3101
02:31:38.970 --> 02:31:41.907
LAURA: We could try with Vess.

3102
02:31:42.930 --> 02:31:45.060
LIAM: So I cast Seeming

3103
02:31:46.300 --> 02:31:50.710
and I make Beauregard look like Astrid

3104
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:53.520
and I make Fjord look like Eodwulf

3105
02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:56.480
and I make myself look like Trent Ikithon

3106
02:31:56.480 --> 02:31:59.770
and I make Nott look like a tiny Vess DeRogna

3107
02:32:00.650 --> 02:32:03.720
and I make Caduceus look like,

3108
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:07.250
oh,

3109
02:32:07.250 --> 02:32:10.260
Marquise Jenna Iresor, Iresor?

3110
02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:12.440
MATT: Jenna Iresor; technically, she's a Baroness.

3111
02:32:12.440 --> 02:32:14.665
The Marquise was a temporary title.

3112
02:32:14.665 --> 02:32:15.660
LIAM: Okay.

3113
02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:17.525
Archmage of Industry.

3114
02:32:19.770 --> 02:32:22.700
Trent is, well you've seen Trent before

3115
02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:24.855
but it's been awhile, so that's a refresher.

3116
02:32:24.855 --> 02:32:28.119
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (mumbles) ♪ It's been a while ♪
TALIESIN: Don't do it.

3117
02:32:28.119 --> 02:32:31.380
LIAM: Astrid is roughly Jester's height,

3118
02:32:31.380 --> 02:32:34.990
but she has a short brown-- this is--

3119
02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:37.530
she looks like she's 17

3120
02:32:38.890 --> 02:32:40.690
is when I saw her last.

3121
02:32:40.690 --> 02:32:45.330
She's got short brown hair, maybe four or five inches long.

3122
02:32:45.330 --> 02:32:46.537
She is slight.

3123
02:32:49.570 --> 02:32:50.520
She has

3124
02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:54.047
attractive, but

3125
02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.782
like severe features.

3126
02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:06.320
Eodwulf is taller than

3127
02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:07.430
Caleb is now

3128
02:33:07.430 --> 02:33:10.660
and is fairly muscular and has

3129
02:33:10.660 --> 02:33:15.033
like a buzzed shorn head of black hair.

3130
02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:20.082
Serious look until Fjord says something.

3131
02:33:21.390 --> 02:33:23.390
He's like

3132
02:33:23.390 --> 02:33:26.650
got thick black hair on his forearms.

3133
02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:31.210
SAM: But Vess DeRogna and Ludinus Da'leth

3134
02:33:31.210 --> 02:33:34.990
we saw in the proximity of--

3135
02:33:34.990 --> 02:33:36.240
LAURA: We saw them.

3136
02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:40.390
LIAM: We saw Vess DeRogna and we saw Ludinus Da'leth.

3137
02:33:40.390 --> 02:33:42.370
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: And then Oremid Hass.

3138
02:33:42.370 --> 02:33:44.394
LIAM: Oremid Hass we saw, yeah.

3139
02:33:44.394 --> 02:33:46.330
MARISHA: But in a different place.
LIAM: In Zadash.

3140
02:33:46.330 --> 02:33:48.426
SAM: Maybe we should start with those

3141
02:33:48.426 --> 02:33:50.600
since we've seen them near one of these Luxons.

3142
02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:53.578
LIAM: We're looking at some of them right now.
LAURA: Okay.

3143
02:33:53.578 --> 02:33:57.020
LAURA: I'm going to just remember what Astrid looks like.

3144
02:33:57.020 --> 02:33:58.140
SAM: Astrid?

3145
02:33:58.140 --> 02:34:00.432
LAURA: Well, just so I have it.

3146
02:34:02.659 --> 02:34:04.700
I'm going to try to not get bogged down

3147
02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:06.910
with the details in their hairstyle

3148
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:10.765
and everything because it's probably changed by now.

3149
02:34:13.430 --> 02:34:16.130
How long ago was this that you knew them again, Caleb?

3150
02:34:21.430 --> 02:34:22.680
LIAM: 33.

3151
02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:23.971
10, 13.

3152
02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:28.490
Shit, I've got all this down somewhere.

3153
02:34:28.490 --> 02:34:32.087
It's a long time ago. I was 16 years old.

3154
02:34:32.087 --> 02:34:33.703
LAURA: A long time, then.

3155
02:34:33.703 --> 02:34:34.839
LIAM: 16, 17.

3156
02:34:34.839 --> 02:34:36.077
LAURA: Because you're like super old now, right?

3157
02:34:36.077 --> 02:34:37.557
TRAVIS: Almost 20 years.
LAURA: Like really old.

3158
02:34:37.557 --> 02:34:38.772
LIAM: I'm 33 years old.

3159
02:34:38.772 --> 02:34:40.276
LAURA: Whoa, you're so old.

3160
02:34:40.276 --> 02:34:45.168
(laughing)

3161
02:34:46.229 --> 02:34:47.229
TALIESIN: That's funny to everyone

3162
02:34:47.229 --> 02:34:48.504
at the table for some reason.

3163
02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:52.810
MATT: Shut up, Marisha.

3164
02:34:55.620 --> 02:34:57.578
MARISHA: Skewing that bell curve.

3165
02:34:58.745 --> 02:35:00.890
LIAM: The last time I saw her, I was 17.

3166
02:35:00.890 --> 02:35:02.100
LAURA: Okay,

3167
02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:02.933
okay.

3168
02:35:02.933 --> 02:35:05.460
LIAM: She was 18.
LAURA: Okay.

3169
02:35:05.460 --> 02:35:08.427
Going for those older girls.

3170
02:35:08.427 --> 02:35:09.353
Okay.

3171
02:35:11.370 --> 02:35:13.660
I'm going to try to scry on Vess.

3172
02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:15.160
MATT: Vess DeRogna?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3173
02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:17.718
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I'm going to sit down

3174
02:35:17.718 --> 02:35:19.420
and I'm going to think real hard about her.

3175
02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:22.260
I'm going to hold onto my Traveler symbol

3176
02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:24.168
and I'm going to go:

3177
02:35:24.168 --> 02:35:27.260
I know this isn't a cult, okay?

3178
02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:28.418
I know.

3179
02:35:29.860 --> 02:35:32.873
And then I'm going to think about her.
MATT: Okay.

3180
02:35:32.873 --> 02:35:35.090
As you clutch your hand and you say that,

3181
02:35:35.090 --> 02:35:39.018
you feel the hands clasp yours and he says "Cult?

3182
02:35:40.140 --> 02:35:41.950
"That's amusing."
LAURA: Right?

3183
02:35:41.950 --> 02:35:43.583
MATT: "Quite amusing.

3184
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:47.498
"Unfortunately,

3185
02:35:48.870 --> 02:35:51.880
"something keeps our vision at bay."

3186
02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:53.960
LAURA: I knew that was going to happen.

3187
02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:57.018
These people are super powerful.

3188
02:35:57.018 --> 02:35:58.140
MATT: "So it would seem,"

3189
02:35:58.140 --> 02:36:00.910
and the hands relax and you see

3190
02:36:00.910 --> 02:36:02.440
as you look back around,

3191
02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:04.860
the brief scattering of green cloak

3192
02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:06.900
before it vanishes out of your periphery

3193
02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:09.207
and you look back and there's nobody there.

3194
02:36:11.157 --> 02:36:12.530
LAURA: Did you see him?

3195
02:36:12.530 --> 02:36:14.160
SAM: No.

3196
02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:15.450
LAURA: You didn't see him?

3197
02:36:15.450 --> 02:36:17.339
TRAVIS: See who?

3198
02:36:17.339 --> 02:36:19.661
LAURA: You guys, you're so crazy.

3199
02:36:19.661 --> 02:36:21.770
You've got to pay attention when I'm scrying

3200
02:36:21.770 --> 02:36:24.410
because he always comes around when I'm scrying.

3201
02:36:24.410 --> 02:36:28.710
LIAM: So one of the Assembly was shielded from you, which

3202
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:32.170
is not surprising to me because I am shielded from them.

3203
02:36:32.170 --> 02:36:33.643
LAURA: Oh, well yeah.

3204
02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:38.615
LIAM: Probably the same is true for one of

3205
02:36:38.615 --> 02:36:43.190
the <i>Vollstrecker</i>, but not definite and then

3206
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:46.170
we have scryed on this blond fellow before.

3207
02:36:46.170 --> 02:36:47.230
LAURA: We can try him again.

3208
02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:49.080
LIAM: And Yasha we have scryed on before.

3209
02:36:50.108 --> 02:36:50.941
LAURA: Yeah.

3210
02:36:52.337 --> 02:36:54.330
I don't think Yasha will know about the beacon,

3211
02:36:54.330 --> 02:36:57.843
but we could scry on her just for shits and giggles.

3212
02:36:57.843 --> 02:37:00.230
MARISHA: I wonder if she's even still
on the same plane as us.

3213
02:37:02.010 --> 02:37:03.610
TRAVIS: Oh god, is that even possible?

3214
02:37:04.590 --> 02:37:05.905
MARISHA: What?

3215
02:37:05.905 --> 02:37:07.310
TRAVIS: That she could be on another plane?

3216
02:37:07.310 --> 02:37:08.930
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3217
02:37:08.930 --> 02:37:10.120
Did you see the

3218
02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:13.350
black anus-looking void

3219
02:37:13.350 --> 02:37:16.210
that the fucking thing was coming through?

3220
02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:20.301
TRAVIS: Yes, I hadn't quite paired that

3221
02:37:20.301 --> 02:37:22.692
with a rectum, but yes.

3222
02:37:22.692 --> 02:37:25.060
LAURA: It did look like a really big butthole, didn't it?

3223
02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:26.710
MARISHA: A giant butthole.

3224
02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:31.636
TRAVIS: Never be able to shake that imagery.
LAURA: Oh, poor Yasha.

3225
02:37:31.636 --> 02:37:35.411
Just having to go into a butthole all the time.

3226
02:37:35.411 --> 02:37:36.730
SAM: Do you want to message the Gentleman then?

3227
02:37:36.730 --> 02:37:38.680
That's a surefire winner.

3228
02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:40.120
LAURA: Message him or scry on him?

3229
02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:41.440
TALIESIN: Message him.
SAM: Message him.

3230
02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:44.050
TALIESIN: He's just going to be doing things.

3231
02:37:44.050 --> 02:37:44.891
LAURA: I don't know,

3232
02:37:44.891 --> 02:37:46.516
what if he's doing secret business meetings?

3233
02:37:46.516 --> 02:37:48.610
TALIESIN: I don't think it's going to be business meetings.

3234
02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:51.280
LAURA: If he's anything, you know,

3235
02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:54.455
like my mama, the business meetings are the other things.

3236
02:37:54.455 --> 02:37:56.610
You can accomplish a lot.

3237
02:37:56.610 --> 02:37:59.160
TALIESIN: That's a fair point.

3238
02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:03.160
Still, a message might be the better way to go.

3239
02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:03.993
LAURA: All right.

3240
02:38:03.993 --> 02:38:06.430
SAM: Before you go--
LAURA: Mm-hm.

3241
02:38:06.430 --> 02:38:08.420
SAM: "Gentleman,

3242
02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:11.080
"Assembly, you have contacts?"

3243
02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:12.740
TRAVIS: Oh, god.
TALIESIN: No.

3244
02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:14.720
SAM: "You have connection?"

3245
02:38:15.801 --> 02:38:17.520
LAURA: This is the stupidest--

3246
02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:21.186
SAM: You're omitting just unimportant words to save space,

3247
02:38:21.186 --> 02:38:23.370
is what I'm saying.

3248
02:38:23.370 --> 02:38:26.650
LAURA: It's stupid! It makes me sound dumb. I don't like it.

3249
02:38:26.650 --> 02:38:29.290
TALIESIN: Would we also be asking about the beacon?

3250
02:38:29.290 --> 02:38:30.430
SAM: "Beacon, where?"

3251
02:38:30.430 --> 02:38:32.080
TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: Poop.

3252
02:38:34.718 --> 02:38:36.635
TALIESIN: Poop.
LAURA: No, I'm not doing that.

3253
02:38:36.635 --> 02:38:37.999
MARISHA: It's her version of stop.

3254
02:38:37.999 --> 02:38:40.232
LAURA: This is possibly my father, you guys.
I have to sound cool.

3255
02:38:40.232 --> 02:38:41.882
TALIESIN: Yeah, you do.

3256
02:38:41.882 --> 02:38:43.940
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send a message to the Gentleman.

3257
02:38:43.940 --> 02:38:45.900
He is always really happy to hear from me.

3258
02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:47.025
MATT: Right.

3259
02:38:48.490 --> 02:38:49.978
LAURA: Hi, dad.

3260
02:38:49.978 --> 02:38:51.745
(laughter)

3261
02:38:51.745 --> 02:38:53.450
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

3262
02:38:53.450 --> 02:38:55.810
Right out the fucking gate?

3263
02:38:56.807 --> 02:38:58.890
TALIESIN: Wow.
TRAVIS: Where is your chill?

3264
02:38:58.890 --> 02:38:59.723
Shit!

3265
02:39:00.842 --> 02:39:05.433
LAURA: So looks like we may be coming back
to the area you're in.

3266
02:39:05.433 --> 02:39:08.340
Do you know anything about this, like, beacon thing?

3267
02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:10.323
Also would love to see you.

3268
02:39:10.323 --> 02:39:11.781
SAM: (groans)

3269
02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:18.527
LAURA: What are you doing right now?
TRAVIS: Nope, that's it.

3270
02:39:18.527 --> 02:39:20.944
MARISHA: I love Sam's disapproval.

3271
02:39:26.530 --> 02:39:29.070
MATT: "I assume this is Jester."

3272
02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:30.970
TRAVIS: No announcement.

3273
02:39:30.970 --> 02:39:33.220
(pounding)

3274
02:39:35.650 --> 02:39:37.430
MATT: "I'm not your father.

3275
02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:41.070
"I don't know what a beacon is

3276
02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:45.080
"and I'm busy.

3277
02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:47.692
"But come say hi if you're in town.

3278
02:39:50.314 --> 02:39:51.842
"Might be work."

3279
02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:56.080
LAURA: He super duper misses us, you guys.

3280
02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:58.080
SAM: Oh, really?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3281
02:39:59.153 --> 02:40:00.900
TRAVIS: Did you know in the beginning

3282
02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:03.720
of your message that you said "Hi, dad?"

3283
02:40:04.940 --> 02:40:07.000
LAURA: Yeah!
TRAVIS: You led with that.

3284
02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.720
LAURA: Well, I've already told him I know he's my dad.

3285
02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:11.810
TRAVIS: Oh, and how did he take it?

3286
02:40:11.810 --> 02:40:13.550
LAURA: He said, he's like, "Oh my gosh, Jester,

3287
02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:16.040
"I've been waiting for a long time to talk to you

3288
02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:18.950
"and see you and gosh, I missed you growing up

3289
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:23.950
"and I can't wait to learn more about your life and stuff."

3290
02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:25.990
TRAVIS: This was all in the reply?

3291
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:28.070
LAURA: Not this particular time-- he said that before.

3292
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:29.860
This time he was just like, "Oh my gosh, Jester.

3293
02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:32.570
"I'm so glad it's you and I miss you so much

3294
02:40:32.570 --> 02:40:34.630
"and please tell your friends to come and visit me.

3295
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:36.980
"I don't know what the beacon is though," is what he said.

3296
02:40:40.170 --> 02:40:41.345
TRAVIS: Sure.

3297
02:40:42.660 --> 02:40:44.360
SAM: A potential lead maybe.

3298
02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:47.220
TALIESIN: For the record, I'm going to drop a pair

3299
02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:49.990
of percentile dice right now just because I'm curious.

3300
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:51.431
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Ooh.

3301
02:40:51.431 --> 02:40:52.889
MATT: What are you--?

3302
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.983
TALIESIN: What?

3303
02:40:54.983 --> 02:40:55.950
Nope.

3304
02:40:55.950 --> 02:40:57.596
SAM: What are you--
LAURA: What do you have to get?

3305
02:40:57.596 --> 02:41:00.621
TALIESIN: I was just going to ask what direction

3306
02:41:01.779 --> 02:41:03.326
we should--

3307
02:41:03.326 --> 02:41:06.454
in what direction we should find the beacon.

3308
02:41:06.454 --> 02:41:08.304
LAURA: You have to roll lower than your level?

3309
02:41:08.304 --> 02:41:09.137
Is that how this works?

3310
02:41:09.137 --> 02:41:11.070
MATT: Yeah, because you have Divine Intervention now.

3311
02:41:11.070 --> 02:41:13.145
It's a 10% chance. You have to roll

3312
02:41:13.145 --> 02:41:14.128
a 10 or lower on the percentile dice.

3313
02:41:14.128 --> 02:41:15.530
TALIESIN: I rolled an 18.

3314
02:41:15.530 --> 02:41:17.230
LAURA: So if this had been a zero, you would've gotten--

3315
02:41:17.230 --> 02:41:18.640
TALIESIN: No, well yeah, actually yeah.

3316
02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:20.400
If this had been a zero, I would've gotten it.

3317
02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:22.720
MATT: Do make your requests before you roll.
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair.

3318
02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:24.270
I already knew what I was asking but I was--

3319
02:41:24.270 --> 02:41:25.800
MATT: Right, right, fair enough.

3320
02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:27.250
TALIESIN: I know it's down for the long rest.

3321
02:41:27.250 --> 02:41:29.270
MATT: It's all good.
TALIESIN: All right.

3322
02:41:29.270 --> 02:41:30.413
SAM: Well.

3323
02:41:30.413 --> 02:41:31.641
LIAM: Well.

3324
02:41:31.641 --> 02:41:33.997
LAURA: I haven't scryed on a second person.

3325
02:41:33.997 --> 02:41:35.580
LIAM: I think it is probably a safe bet

3326
02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:37.810
that all the Assembly are equally protected.

3327
02:41:37.810 --> 02:41:41.010
So our options are--
TRAVIS: Blondie.

3328
02:41:41.010 --> 02:41:42.140
LIAM: Blondie.
SAM: Or Yasha.

3329
02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:44.445
LIAM: Or a student. Yasha--

3330
02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:49.750
let's figure out where we're going tonight

3331
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:51.610
and then Yasha, we could do tomorrow.

3332
02:41:51.610 --> 02:41:52.840
SAM: Yeah.

3333
02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:54.294
LAURA: Okay.

3334
02:41:54.294 --> 02:41:56.061
MARISHA: Do you think Astrid is--

3335
02:41:57.210 --> 02:41:59.130
LAURA: Probably the same way that you are.

3336
02:41:59.130 --> 02:42:02.560
MARISHA: Yeah, if she's been in the--

3337
02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:05.010
in with the Vollstreckers for that amount of time.

3338
02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:08.845
LIAM: I would have

3339
02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:14.957
received this had I finished my training.

3340
02:42:14.957 --> 02:42:16.757
MARISHA: Did you get that from prison lady?

3341
02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:20.178
LIAM: Nope.
LAURA: Did you steal it?

3342
02:42:21.330 --> 02:42:22.990
LIAM: Pretty much.

3343
02:42:22.990 --> 02:42:25.230
MARISHA: What's it do?

3344
02:42:25.230 --> 02:42:26.910
LIAM: Makes sure that I cannot be seen

3345
02:42:26.910 --> 02:42:28.785
or found by someone like Jester.

3346
02:42:30.190 --> 02:42:31.620
MARISHA: Oh.

3347
02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:32.453
TALIESIN: So.

3348
02:42:32.453 --> 02:42:33.711
MARISHA: So they have to have not

3349
02:42:33.711 --> 02:42:35.619
completed their training yet.

3350
02:42:36.750 --> 02:42:37.583
LAURA: Okay.

3351
02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:42.220
MARISHA: Would anyone who's even finished their training be

3352
02:42:42.220 --> 02:42:45.120
entrusted with something like knowing where the beacon is?

3353
02:42:46.250 --> 02:42:47.766
LIAM: No, I was fairly isolated

3354
02:42:47.766 --> 02:42:50.682
while I was being instructed.

3355
02:42:52.290 --> 02:42:55.370
TRAVIS: No offense, it seems like

3356
02:42:55.370 --> 02:42:57.150
those of his ilk are used more for

3357
02:42:57.150 --> 02:43:01.597
offensive or upsetting, clandestine missions.

3358
02:43:06.050 --> 02:43:09.306
LAURA: Maybe I'll scry on...

3359
02:43:11.330 --> 02:43:12.480
TRAVIS: Blondie.

3360
02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:14.380
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Blondie, I guess.

3361
02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:16.820
TRAVIS: Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll overhear something.

3362
02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:17.690
LAURA: Although I think Blondie

3363
02:43:17.690 --> 02:43:21.310
was just in it for the portals, right?

3364
02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:23.360
He didn't have anything to do with the beacon.

3365
02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:25.968
TALIESIN: Well, we honestly don't know what's connected

3366
02:43:25.968 --> 02:43:27.868
to what yet. Although it is strange that all this

3367
02:43:27.868 --> 02:43:29.626
is happening at the same time.

3368
02:43:29.626 --> 02:43:31.930
MARISHA: We scryed on him because we got a fraction

3369
02:43:31.930 --> 02:43:35.450
of his robe that was left behind with one of the portals.

3370
02:43:35.450 --> 02:43:36.283
LAURA: Yeah.

3371
02:43:36.283 --> 02:43:39.176
MARISHA: So are we even sure if

3372
02:43:39.176 --> 02:43:41.980
what's his demon face that

3373
02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:46.980
abducted Yasha wasn't that guy, but under disguise?

3374
02:43:46.980 --> 02:43:48.530
LAURA: I don't think it was the same person.

3375
02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:51.550
MARISHA: A different person, okay.

3376
02:43:51.550 --> 02:43:52.783
LAURA: I don't know.

3377
02:43:52.783 --> 02:43:54.600
MARISHA: Because we were trying to like track--

3378
02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:55.710
LAURA: Yeah, he had the book.

3379
02:43:55.710 --> 02:43:57.360
MARISHA: He led us; he had the book.

3380
02:43:58.267 --> 02:44:02.209
I mean, we can try because he was in the room with Dol--

3381
02:44:02.209 --> 02:44:03.534
Dalan?

3382
02:44:06.130 --> 02:44:07.321
Kingidoo.

3383
02:44:08.230 --> 02:44:10.017
LIAM: Dwendal.
MARISHA: Dwendal!

3384
02:44:11.530 --> 02:44:13.220
Like you said, I don't know--

3385
02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:15.472
TRAVIS: Do it.
MARISHA: But do it.

3386
02:44:17.190 --> 02:44:19.958
LAURA: All right, I'm going to scry on old Blondie.

3387
02:44:19.958 --> 02:44:22.275
LIAM: We'll learn something.
MATT: All right.

3388
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:26.862
What's your spell DC?

3389
02:44:28.531 --> 02:44:30.290
TRAVIS: One day we'll get a man inside of a teacup.

3390
02:44:30.290 --> 02:44:32.398
LAURA: I think it's seven-- yeah, 17.

3391
02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:40.000
MATT: Feeling the proximity of the Gentleman--

3392
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:43.480
not the Gentleman, the Traveler a second time.

3393
02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:46.800
So many "the, the" male characters in the past half hour.

3394
02:44:47.937 --> 02:44:48.770
TRAVIS: The waiter.

3395
02:44:49.625 --> 02:44:53.078
MATT: The Traveler sits at your side.

3396
02:44:54.270 --> 02:44:56.195
Puts his hands around yours.

3397
02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:00.500
"His will's strong, I'm sorry."

3398
02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:02.467
MARISHA: Fuck.
SAM: Again.

3399
02:45:02.467 --> 02:45:04.395
LAURA: Mother bitch.
SAM: Balls.

3400
02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:07.920
LAURA: I'm useless today, I'm absolutely useless.

3401
02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:09.542
MARISHA: It's been a long day.

3402
02:45:09.542 --> 02:45:10.375
TRAVIS: I wouldn't say that.

3403
02:45:10.375 --> 02:45:14.230
Some of us have just been sitting here watching, so.

3404
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:15.890
TALIESIN: Well.

3405
02:45:15.890 --> 02:45:18.770
MARISHA: Get the fucking-- gods!

3406
02:45:18.770 --> 02:45:21.370
MATT: The battle continues.

3407
02:45:21.370 --> 02:45:22.578
TALIESIN: I think that's a mosquito now.

3408
02:45:22.578 --> 02:45:24.044
I think we've upgraded.

3409
02:45:24.044 --> 02:45:25.714
LAURA: I hope not, I've gotten bit up.

3410
02:45:25.714 --> 02:45:27.940
TRAVIS: He's more nimble than his predecessor.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3411
02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:30.520
Well, there is still one option available to us.

3412
02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:31.760
SAM: Which is?

3413
02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:34.120
TALIESIN: There's always the Wildmother.

3414
02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:34.953
SAM: Okay.

3415
02:45:36.214 --> 02:45:39.120
TALIESIN: Do you want to help me go through this?

3416
02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:40.901
TRAVIS: Of course.

3417
02:45:40.901 --> 02:45:43.938
TALIESIN: All right, the last ditch is some Commune.

3418
02:45:45.650 --> 02:45:48.620
I'm going to burn my last fifth of the day

3419
02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:52.070
and let's have a Commune with the Wildmother.

3420
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:53.130
MATT: All right.

3421
02:45:54.925 --> 02:45:56.270
As you concentrate,

3422
02:45:56.270 --> 02:46:00.050
you feel your consciousness expand a bit.

3423
02:46:00.050 --> 02:46:03.350
You focus in your mind on the tree above you

3424
02:46:03.350 --> 02:46:06.653
and through that tree, use it almost like a--

3425
02:46:08.889 --> 02:46:12.620
a divining rod to gain her attention.

3426
02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:14.010
The warmth washes over you

3427
02:46:14.010 --> 02:46:16.260
and you sense that she can hear your request.

3428
02:46:19.950 --> 02:46:21.900
TALIESIN: We're following many

3429
02:46:24.890 --> 02:46:28.710
strange directions on this path that we're on.

3430
02:46:28.710 --> 02:46:33.050
We currently search for a beacon of the Luxon.

3431
02:46:36.410 --> 02:46:38.000
Would you know which direction or where

3432
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:41.750
we might travel to find that which we seek?

3433
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:44.240
MATT: Unfortunately, the questions have to be yes or no.

3434
02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:47.780
TALIESIN: Or they-- that's right, they need to be super--

3435
02:46:47.780 --> 02:46:49.984
so they can be answered, that's right.

3436
02:46:49.984 --> 02:46:52.500
MATT: They need to be answered with a yes or a no

3437
02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:54.240
or an uncertain answer.
TALIESIN: Or an uncertain.

3438
02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:55.510
All right, sorry.

3439
02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:57.098
MATT: Yeah, it's the Ouija board of special spells.

3440
02:46:57.098 --> 02:46:58.714
TALIESIN: All right.

3441
02:46:59.850 --> 02:47:01.900
May I take a re--
MATT: I'll let you retake

3442
02:47:01.900 --> 02:47:03.710
because you would know this.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3443
02:47:06.531 --> 02:47:07.897
Will we find

3444
02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:12.350
what we're looking for in the islands to the south?

3445
02:47:19.430 --> 02:47:20.846
MATT: "Yes."

3446
02:47:28.650 --> 02:47:31.170
TALIESIN: Does our friend Yasha work against us

3447
02:47:31.170 --> 02:47:33.561
at this moment, on this quest?

3448
02:47:35.003 --> 02:47:35.836
(zap)

3449
02:47:35.836 --> 02:47:39.111
(cheering)

3450
02:47:39.111 --> 02:47:41.238
LIAM: Dead for a ducat, dead!

3451
02:47:42.547 --> 02:47:43.380
(zap)

3452
02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:45.561
(laughter)

3453
02:47:45.561 --> 02:47:46.394
LIAM: Jesus.

3454
02:47:46.394 --> 02:47:48.265
TALIESIN: That which is dead cannot die.

3455
02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:51.490
MATT: All righty.
LIAM: Revenant.

3456
02:47:55.620 --> 02:47:57.579
MATT: The question was?

3457
02:47:57.579 --> 02:47:58.440
TALIESIN: Is Yasha working against us?

3458
02:47:58.440 --> 02:47:59.640
MATT: Against the quest?

3459
02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:03.170
TALIESIN: Against this particular quest, yeah.

3460
02:48:03.170 --> 02:48:04.003
MATT: "No."

3461
02:48:06.039 --> 02:48:08.223
LAURA: (whispering) Does this look like Uk'otoa?

3462
02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:12.985
TALIESIN: Have we met

3463
02:48:14.111 --> 02:48:16.878
those who would keep us--

3464
02:48:16.878 --> 02:48:20.711
those who would keep us from this artifact?

3465
02:48:20.711 --> 02:48:22.607
Are they known to us?

3466
02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:27.808
Have we seen their faces?

3467
02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:30.935
MATT: "Uncertain."

3468
02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:36.400
You get the sense--
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3469
02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:40.230
MATT: That when you made a request about the

3470
02:48:41.733 --> 02:48:43.370
mission or quest you were on--

3471
02:48:43.370 --> 02:48:45.870
TALIESIN: The quest, the islands seemed to ping.

3472
02:48:45.870 --> 02:48:46.936
But it could be a lot of--

3473
02:48:46.936 --> 02:48:49.320
MATT: There are many quests you are on.
TALIESIN: Okay.

3474
02:48:49.320 --> 02:48:52.840
MATT: That answer pertained to one of them.
TALIESIN: Okay.

3475
02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:55.400
There is something in those islands at the very least.

3476
02:48:56.936 --> 02:48:59.757
LAURA: Are they looking at the fly?
TALIESIN: They're looking at the fly.

3477
02:48:59.757 --> 02:49:01.720
SAM: It's still alive?
MARISHA: It still lives.

3478
02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:03.480
LIAM: You're gone, Vax, you're gone.
(zapping)

3479
02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:04.550
SAM: Oh, god.
LAURA: Is it dead?

3480
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:06.407
MATT: Jesus.
LAURA: Is it finally dead?

3481
02:49:06.407 --> 02:49:07.240
SAM: That was horrifying.

3482
02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:09.265
LAURA: I don't like it when they're still alive.

3483
02:49:09.265 --> 02:49:12.200
TALIESIN: The ones we were just speaking of with the rune.

3484
02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:13.290
MATT: Okay.

3485
02:49:13.290 --> 02:49:15.840
TALIESIN: Oh no-- I mean-- yeah.
MATT: Those are in a lake.

3486
02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:17.320
TALIESIN: Those are in a lake, okay.

3487
02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:20.411
MATT: So those are what you were referring to.
TALIESIN: That was.

3488
02:49:22.140 --> 02:49:23.580
But not, I--
MATT: Uncertain.

3489
02:49:23.580 --> 02:49:26.770
TALIESIN: I'll also say that there was--

3490
02:49:26.770 --> 02:49:29.065
in the spell, you don't actually have

3491
02:49:29.065 --> 02:49:31.310
to answer with a yes, no, or uncertain.

3492
02:49:31.310 --> 02:49:34.973
You can be vaguely more specific if you choose to.

3493
02:49:35.978 --> 02:49:37.590
I can only ask questions--
MATT: Okay, now.

3494
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:38.740
Fair enough, fair enough.

3495
02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:40.670
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Fair enough, then--

3496
02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:41.760
LIAM: The magic eight ball says--

3497
02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:44.250
TALIESIN: The magic eight ball says, yeah.

3498
02:49:44.250 --> 02:49:45.700
MATT: So for the first question, the answer would be--

3499
02:49:45.700 --> 02:49:47.433
TALIESIN: Not those islands, apparently.

3500
02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:53.940
MATT: "In that direction."

3501
02:49:53.940 --> 02:49:55.156
TALIESIN: All right.

3502
02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:01.050
I have a very vague lead

3503
02:50:01.050 --> 02:50:03.642
towards something at the very least.

3504
02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:06.310
So if we want to--

3505
02:50:06.310 --> 02:50:08.540
if we have nothing else, that is a way to go.

3506
02:50:10.540 --> 02:50:12.165
SAM: What is your lead?

3507
02:50:13.090 --> 02:50:16.060
TALIESIN: I would have said most of this out loud, so.

3508
02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:18.680
There is something worth

3509
02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:22.770
our attention to the islands south of us.

3510
02:50:22.770 --> 02:50:23.890
SAM: Okay.

3511
02:50:23.890 --> 02:50:26.160
MATT: Southwest of Rosohna.
TALIESIN: Southwest.

3512
02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:28.477
Yeah, the one's back in that--
MATT: Somewhere in that

3513
02:50:28.477 --> 02:50:32.064
direction is something of interest perhaps.

3514
02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:34.447
SAM: Well, poop.

3515
02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:37.610
What do we do?

3516
02:50:37.610 --> 02:50:40.370
You know, the one-- we could-- do you think Dairon

3517
02:50:40.370 --> 02:50:44.160
would know anything about where this thing might be kept?

3518
02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:45.340
MARISHA: I don't know if she would know anything

3519
02:50:45.340 --> 02:50:48.740
currently, but she may have directions,

3520
02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:50.700
she might be able to answer some questions.

3521
02:50:50.700 --> 02:50:52.210
TALIESIN: Would she tell you?

3522
02:50:52.210 --> 02:50:53.500
MARISHA: Yeah, she would tell me.

3523
02:50:53.500 --> 02:50:56.440
She wants to work together.

3524
02:50:56.440 --> 02:50:58.590
If anything, it's us that's been aloof.

3525
02:50:58.590 --> 02:51:00.285
Did you see that?

3526
02:51:00.285 --> 02:51:01.510
TALIESIN: I don't think I can be aloof.

3527
02:51:02.490 --> 02:51:03.530
SAM: Well.

3528
02:51:03.530 --> 02:51:07.040
MARISHA: Natural 20. I accidentally dropped it.

3529
02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:09.230
SAM: What do we do?
LIAM: We should bring Dairon--

3530
02:51:09.230 --> 02:51:10.630
MARISHA: I need to talk to Dairon at some point.

3531
02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:12.380
LIAM: --further into our plans.

3532
02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:16.080
LAURA: Well, then--
MARISHA: We could go and maybe-- I don't.

3533
02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:17.777
TRAVIS: You know, Rumblecusp Island

3534
02:51:17.777 --> 02:51:22.317
on the Menagerie Coast also has a volcano.

3535
02:51:22.317 --> 02:51:23.150
That's southwest of--

3536
02:51:23.150 --> 02:51:25.520
TALIESIN: Since we have to be there anyway.

3537
02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:28.183
And there is a wizard we can talk to.

3538
02:51:28.183 --> 02:51:29.249
MARISHA: If--

3539
02:51:31.925 --> 02:51:35.374
If we're going to try and make it to Traveler Con,

3540
02:51:35.374 --> 02:51:37.220
we're going to have to get back on the boat.

3541
02:51:38.820 --> 02:51:40.560
SAM: We have months for that.

3542
02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:41.780
TALIESIN: Weeks.
MARISHA: Six weeks.

3543
02:51:41.780 --> 02:51:42.613
LAURA: Seven weeks.

3544
02:51:43.492 --> 02:51:44.985
SAM: Yeah, but it seems like this is a bit more--

3545
02:51:44.985 --> 02:51:47.630
no offense but this is a bit more pressing, no?

3546
02:51:47.630 --> 02:51:49.108
We're not going to wait six weeks

3547
02:51:49.108 --> 02:51:51.347
to start looking for the Luxon.

3548
02:51:51.347 --> 02:51:53.747
TALIESIN: I think we have to keep shaking

3549
02:51:53.747 --> 02:51:55.754
bushes, personally. And I don't know if it's--

3550
02:51:55.754 --> 02:51:58.022
this thing has been lost for a while

3551
02:51:58.022 --> 02:51:59.405
and I don't think we're going to find it

3552
02:51:59.405 --> 02:52:01.563
in the next 48-- I don't think we're going to find a state

3553
02:52:01.563 --> 02:52:03.496
secret in the next 48 hours.

3554
02:52:03.496 --> 02:52:05.680
SAM: No, but we also don't need to go

3555
02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:09.990
to get ready for Traveler Con six weeks early.

3556
02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:12.731
TALIESIN: No, there's other things to do.
LAURA: Speak for yourself

3557
02:52:12.731 --> 02:52:14.164
TALIESIN: And there's people to talk to there.

3558
02:52:14.164 --> 02:52:16.514
At least it's a place to go to start shaking bushes.

3559
02:52:16.514 --> 02:52:18.380
MARISHA: I'm just pointing out that it's going to take

3560
02:52:18.380 --> 02:52:20.830
a little bit of time to get on a boat and travel.

3561
02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:24.200
Not six weeks' worth.
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

3562
02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:25.790
It just would be nice to have

3563
02:52:25.790 --> 02:52:29.150
one lead somewhere in the Empire.

3564
02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:30.717
TALIESIN: Well, if we get into the Empire,

3565
02:52:30.717 --> 02:52:33.220
then we have to get out of the Empire.

3566
02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:36.150
SAM: We have a teleport guy.
TRAVIS: We do.

3567
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:40.450
LIAM: I think that we should let Beauregard

3568
02:52:40.450 --> 02:52:44.830
discuss with Dairon and then we should return.

3569
02:52:44.830 --> 02:52:46.640
MARISHA: What are y'all's comfortability with Dairon?

3570
02:52:46.640 --> 02:52:48.210
SAM: Return to what?

3571
02:52:48.210 --> 02:52:49.700
LIAM: Home.
SAM: To the Empire?

3572
02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:51.930
LAURA: If you trust her, Beau, then we trust her.

3573
02:52:51.930 --> 02:52:53.870
TRAVIS: Seconded.

3574
02:52:54.960 --> 02:52:58.457
MARISHA: I know she wants in a little bit more.

3575
02:53:00.592 --> 02:53:02.077
It's just tricky.

3576
02:53:03.310 --> 02:53:04.143
TALIESIN: Maybe

3577
02:53:05.630 --> 02:53:07.430
they'd be willing for me to...

3578
02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:14.787
get a sense of just how trustworthy they are.

3579
02:53:18.130 --> 02:53:20.190
MARISHA: It's not a doubt of my trust.

3580
02:53:20.190 --> 02:53:22.690
TALIESIN: I'm talking about our trust, my trust.

3581
02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:26.250
MARISHA: Do you feel like you need that?

3582
02:53:26.250 --> 02:53:27.530
TALIESIN: I'd like it.

3583
02:53:27.530 --> 02:53:29.480
MARISHA: All right.

3584
02:53:29.480 --> 02:53:31.270
What are you going to do to her?

3585
02:53:31.270 --> 02:53:34.220
TALIESIN: Cast a bit of a truth spell.

3586
02:53:34.220 --> 02:53:35.420
MARISHA: Okay.

3587
02:53:36.700 --> 02:53:37.900
Good luck.

3588
02:53:37.900 --> 02:53:40.500
TALIESIN: I mean the idea would be not sneakily,

3589
02:53:40.500 --> 02:53:41.333
but to ask if--

3590
02:53:41.333 --> 02:53:43.630
MARISHA: Yeah, no, asking would be polite.

3591
02:53:43.630 --> 02:53:46.080
TALIESIN: Asking if we could, you know,

3592
02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:49.318
just make sure that all the cards are on the table.

3593
02:53:50.615 --> 02:53:52.080
MARISHA: What do we want to have her do?

3594
02:53:52.080 --> 02:53:53.920
Do we want to have her try and stay here

3595
02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:57.427
and be like our liaison while we're gone?

3596
02:53:57.427 --> 02:53:59.370
SAM: Whatever she wants to do.

3597
02:53:59.370 --> 02:54:02.980
I'm mostly concerned with any leads or information she

3598
02:54:02.980 --> 02:54:05.800
might have about how they move things around in the Empire.

3599
02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:08.140
LIAM: Yes, she's a little restricted here on her own,

3600
02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:10.330
but perhaps this is where she prefers to be.

3601
02:54:10.330 --> 02:54:13.417
I too, Nott, would like to know.

3602
02:54:13.417 --> 02:54:15.990
We tell her everything, what we are trying to accomplish,

3603
02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:19.750
what we need to find, and maybe it will ring a bell for her.

3604
02:54:19.750 --> 02:54:23.260
Something. By the way, just as a bit of flare here,

3605
02:54:23.260 --> 02:54:27.100
everyone is still under Seeming and people

3606
02:54:27.100 --> 02:54:30.561
may or may not notice Caleb occasionally just staring

3607
02:54:30.561 --> 02:54:34.480
at Seeming Astrid for stretches of time

3608
02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:36.900
before shaking out of it multiple times.

3609
02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:38.091
MATT: Okay.

3610
02:54:43.182 --> 02:54:45.654
MARISHA: I'm going to go get Dairon.

3611
02:54:45.654 --> 02:54:46.826
MATT: All right.

3612
02:54:46.826 --> 02:54:50.410
MARISHA: Dairon, I look like Caleb's ex, don't be weird.

3613
02:54:51.710 --> 02:54:54.680
MATT: Dairon comes back down the stairs.

3614
02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:57.783
"I appreciate the warning."

3615
02:54:57.783 --> 02:54:59.360
MARISHA: We were doing a little thought experiment.

3616
02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:01.418
MATT: She puts the dagger away.

3617
02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:05.246
"This is very...

3618
02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:07.760
"curious."

3619
02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:09.301
TALIESIN: Oh, I forgot.

3620
02:55:10.904 --> 02:55:14.283
MATT: "I am not one to ask. What do you require?"

3621
02:55:14.283 --> 02:55:16.295
LIAM: I drop Seeming.

3622
02:55:16.295 --> 02:55:17.920
MATT: "Ah, much better.

3623
02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:18.753
"So?"

3624
02:55:18.753 --> 02:55:21.494
MARISHA: We're trying to figure out our plan going forward.

3625
02:55:21.494 --> 02:55:22.644
MATT: "Mm-hm."

3626
02:55:25.220 --> 02:55:27.670
MARISHA: We've been tasked to try and

3627
02:55:27.670 --> 02:55:30.486
find the last lost beacon,

3628
02:55:32.802 --> 02:55:36.702
to potentially bring this whole war to the end

3629
02:55:36.702 --> 02:55:39.372
that I think we all want to see.

3630
02:55:42.300 --> 02:55:44.200
I figured I'd come out of the gate with it.

3631
02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:46.400
TRAVIS: That's good, yeah.
TALIESIN: I'm impressed.

3632
02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:50.535
MATT: "So you are on a mission for the Dynasty?

3633
02:55:51.380 --> 02:55:52.213
"Correct?

3634
02:55:53.210 --> 02:55:55.100
"To return an artifact

3635
02:55:55.100 --> 02:55:57.649
"of great power to the Bright Queen.

3636
02:55:57.649 --> 02:55:58.641
"Again."

3637
02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:04.472
MARISHA: I am on a mission

3638
02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:08.742
with my team and my family

3639
02:56:10.130 --> 02:56:13.720
that we believe could help bring an end to this conflict.

3640
02:56:14.930 --> 02:56:17.115
It has nothing to do with sides.

3641
02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:20.300
It has to do with wanting

3642
02:56:20.300 --> 02:56:23.137
to see the end to death and suffering.

3643
02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:28.640
MATT: Dairon--
MARISHA: If some-- sorry.

3644
02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:30.280
MATT: Continue.

3645
02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:34.040
MARISHA: If a bunch of wizard fucks stole an artifact

3646
02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:38.630
in their ostentatious and vain search

3647
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:42.300
for more fucking power or eternal life or whatever the fuck,

3648
02:56:43.380 --> 02:56:46.130
I don't honestly care.

3649
02:56:46.130 --> 02:56:48.040
I'd rather give it back

3650
02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:52.040
and not continue to watch my people die

3651
02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:55.450
because of some aristocratic,

3652
02:56:55.450 --> 02:56:59.450
powerful, highfalutin piece of shit's overall mission.

3653
02:56:59.450 --> 02:57:02.033
LIAM: You've expressed your problems

3654
02:57:02.033 --> 02:57:04.891
with the Assembly yourself.

3655
02:57:04.891 --> 02:57:06.817
Their intentions are not...

3656
02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:08.993
worthy.

3657
02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:14.293
The Empire would be better without them.

3658
02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:18.650
MARISHA: Yeah, I've seen racism, I've seen bigotry,

3659
02:57:18.650 --> 02:57:22.240
I've seen hatred coming from both sides.

3660
02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:27.713
All of that only added fuel to this giant fucking fire.

3661
02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:33.380
If we can maybe remove one of these...

3662
02:57:36.670 --> 02:57:40.100
bombs, I don't know, whatever,

3663
02:57:40.100 --> 02:57:41.975
remove any amount of pressure,

3664
02:57:42.820 --> 02:57:44.660
don't you think that's fucking worth it?

3665
02:57:46.470 --> 02:57:49.470
MATT: Dairon's eyes have not moved to Caleb or anyone else

3666
02:57:49.470 --> 02:57:52.000
and have just been focused on reading you.

3667
02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.060
She takes a few slightly aggressive steps in your direction

3668
02:57:56.060 --> 02:57:58.827
and looks you but a few inches from your face.

3669
02:58:02.140 --> 02:58:04.082
"And you truly believe this?

3670
02:58:07.540 --> 02:58:11.420
"As an Expositor, for everything that we represent,

3671
02:58:11.420 --> 02:58:14.472
"under the gaze of the Knowing Mistress herself,

3672
02:58:15.430 --> 02:58:18.673
"you believe this and would stake your life on it?"

3673
02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:23.130
MARISHA: You told me to seek out the corruption.

3674
02:58:24.170 --> 02:58:26.120
You told me to trust no one.

3675
02:58:28.669 --> 02:58:30.675
You told me to find the information.

3676
02:58:31.900 --> 02:58:33.750
I could be fucking wrong.

3677
02:58:35.740 --> 02:58:38.720
But I'm doing exactly what you told me to do.

3678
02:58:38.720 --> 02:58:41.180
What <i>you</i> told me to do.

3679
02:58:41.180 --> 02:58:42.747
Fuck the Cobalt Soul.

3680
02:58:47.600 --> 02:58:49.310
You're the first person who even ever

3681
02:58:49.310 --> 02:58:52.060
fucking believed that I could make something of myself.

3682
02:58:54.516 --> 02:58:56.670
I don't know who vouched for me over there,

3683
02:58:56.670 --> 02:59:00.537
but I'm assuming it was you. I've always assumed it was you.

3684
02:59:06.270 --> 02:59:08.336
MATT: "I am proud of you.

3685
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:14.970
"You are a fine Expositor,

3686
02:59:16.280 --> 02:59:17.737
"which you now are.

02:59:17.737 --> 02:59:18.995
LAURA: (gasps)

3688
02:59:20.430 --> 02:59:23.360
"Because <i>I</i> say so.

3689
02:59:26.070 --> 02:59:26.903
"Now,

3690
02:59:28.290 --> 02:59:31.730
"I will not mention that you said, "'Fuck the Cobalt Soul.'"

3691
02:59:31.730 --> 02:59:33.230
MARISHA: Oh, don't tell anybody that.

3692
02:59:34.654 --> 02:59:36.727
I meant it more on like principle.

3693
02:59:37.860 --> 02:59:42.383
MATT: "And I hope that your instincts are correct.

3694
02:59:44.010 --> 02:59:45.243
"Survive this,

3695
02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:50.870
"then the others will know what I know as well,

3696
02:59:50.870 --> 02:59:55.790
"of what you've done and what you are capable of."

3697
03:00:00.910 --> 03:00:02.360
MARISHA: (shakily) Okay.

3698
03:00:05.160 --> 03:00:06.560
I hope I'm right, too.

3699
03:00:07.940 --> 03:00:09.815
I hope we're right.

3700
03:00:13.139 --> 03:00:16.347
SAM: Do you know where we could start?

3701
03:00:17.680 --> 03:00:21.580
MATT: "Well, I imagine if you're looking for the Assembly

3702
03:00:21.580 --> 03:00:23.790
"and where most of its business is done,

You going to try and stay here?

MARISHA: I don't know if you heard about that,

03:02:13.650 --> 03:02:17.250
but she filed it down to like a dagger,

3736
03:02:17.250 --> 03:02:19.330
shank type thing. It was crazy.

3737
03:02:19.330 --> 03:02:21.849
TRAVIS: She also could have had it given to her.

3738
03:02:21.849 --> 03:02:23.638

LIAM: I know what I heard.

3773
03:04:01.420 --> 03:04:03.810
MATT: "Vence Nuthaleus."

3774
03:04:03.810 --> 03:04:05.237
MARISHA: Nuthalees?

3775
03:04:05.237 --> 03:04:06.354
MATT: "Nuthaleus."

3776
03:04:06.354 --> 03:04:07.471
LAURA: Nuthaleus.

3777
03:04:07.471 --> 03:04:10.520
MATT: N-U-T-H-A-L-E-U-S.

3778
03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:13.297
LIAM: Vence Nuthaleus.

3779
03:04:13.297 --> 03:04:17.297
LAURA: I was really close to the way he spelled that.

3780
03:04:19.210 --> 03:04:21.290
MATT: "Why are you looking for this one?"

3781
03:04:21.290 --> 03:04:24.180
LAURA: Is he a shitty person?

3782
03:04:24.180 --> 03:04:25.250
MATT: "I don't know him personally.

3783
03:04:25.250 --> 03:04:26.910
"I've only seen him around a few times.

3784
03:04:26.910 --> 03:04:30.196
"He is the Annex to Ludinus."

3785
03:04:30.196 --> 03:04:33.518
MARISHA: The Annex to Ludinus, one of the lead guys?

3786
03:04:33.518 --> 03:04:37.018
LIAM: Yes, assistant to <i>the</i> main.

3787
03:04:37.018 --> 03:04:39.008
MARISHA: Oh, shit, oh.

3788
03:04:39.008 --> 03:04:41.840
SAM: Would Ludinus have been called "my liege?"

3789
03:04:43.220 --> 03:04:47.195
MATT: "No, 'my liege' would be used primarily for

3790
03:04:47.195 --> 03:04:48.720
"King Dwendal."

3791
03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:50.180
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3792
03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:53.910
MARISHA: Well, we found a piece of Vence's robe

3793
03:04:53.910 --> 03:04:57.700
along with the portal or one of the portals--

3794
03:04:57.700 --> 03:04:59.640
LAURA: He was helping to open the portals!

3795
03:04:59.640 --> 03:05:00.473
MARISHA: To the Abyss.

3796
03:05:00.473 --> 03:05:02.995
LAURA: The buttholes to the Abyss!

3797
03:05:05.140 --> 03:05:07.020
MARISHA: We did, we heard rumor that

3798
03:05:07.020 --> 03:05:09.750
there were portals opening on both sides, right?

3799
03:05:10.976 --> 03:05:12.110
SAM: He could be working with someone on this--

3800
03:05:12.110 --> 03:05:14.520
he was working with someone on this side.

3801
03:05:14.520 --> 03:05:16.430
We know that person, we chased them up

3802
03:05:16.430 --> 03:05:20.280
to the north and they opened up The Laughing Hand.

3803
03:05:20.280 --> 03:05:21.680
MARISHA: I've said so many times I feel

3804
03:05:21.680 --> 03:05:23.770
like this war is a giant distraction.

3805
03:05:24.940 --> 03:05:27.498
LAURA: Did you look up anything else about the

3806
03:05:29.080 --> 03:05:32.210
Angel of Irons or something?

3807
03:05:32.210 --> 03:05:34.150
MATT: "I have not been able to go to any

3808
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:36.240
"of the existing archives since I've been here.

3809
03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:38.220
"As you know--"
LAURA: It's probably important.

3810
03:05:38.220 --> 03:05:39.053
MATT: "I understand that,

3811
03:05:39.053 --> 03:05:41.144
"but I am not in a place to do research.

3812
03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:45.040
"Once I return maybe to one of the archives,

3813
03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:48.327
"but now I have no means of doing so."

3814
03:05:48.327 --> 03:05:50.840
SAM: Ludinus would be primarily

3815
03:05:50.840 --> 03:05:53.400
stationed in Rexxentrum, correct?

3816
03:05:53.400 --> 03:05:54.558
MATT: "That is where his abode is,

3817
03:05:54.558 --> 03:05:56.699
"but he moves around a lot.

3818
03:05:56.699 --> 03:06:00.360
"He oversees much, both politically

3819
03:06:00.360 --> 03:06:03.593
"and within the business of the Assembly.

3820
03:06:08.360 --> 03:06:10.617
"He is one of the founders."

3821
03:06:11.930 --> 03:06:15.260
LIAM: He's very old.
MATT: "And quite capable."

3822
03:06:16.460 --> 03:06:18.960
LAURA: Yeah, he looked really scary when we saw him, right?

3823
03:06:22.370 --> 03:06:25.050
TALIESIN: Well, that makes things more difficult.

3824
03:06:25.050 --> 03:06:27.680
LIAM: I do have

3825
03:06:27.680 --> 03:06:29.040
one idea.
SAM: Yes?

3826
03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:32.352
LIAM: Bouncing off of Dairon.

3827
03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:36.010
I do know where the home

3828
03:06:36.010 --> 03:06:40.288
of Trent Ikithon is, outside of Rexxentrum.

3829
03:06:44.040 --> 03:06:48.660
Probably a death trap, but I know where it is.

3830
03:06:48.660 --> 03:06:51.210
TALIESIN: I don't know, that seems--

3831
03:06:51.210 --> 03:06:54.547
LIAM: He doesn't spent most of his time there.

3832
03:06:57.284 --> 03:06:59.484
TALIESIN: It's possibly a better idea than trying to

3833
03:07:01.990 --> 03:07:04.245
extract information from

3834
03:07:05.820 --> 03:07:07.690
a fortress or something like that.

3835
03:07:07.690 --> 03:07:10.220
This seems more--

3836
03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:12.380
LIAM: We would be breaking into the private residence

3837
03:07:12.380 --> 03:07:16.980
of one of the most dangerous men in the Dwendalian Empire.

3838
03:07:16.980 --> 03:07:20.782
LAURA: Yes, but does he have access to these badass paints?

3839
03:07:23.380 --> 03:07:27.740
MATT: You see, you watch as Dairon's head turns,

3840
03:07:27.740 --> 03:07:31.298
slowly cocked to one side,

3841
03:07:31.298 --> 03:07:33.415
then turns back to Beau.

3842
03:07:33.415 --> 03:07:35.530
MARISHA: They're magic paints.

3843
03:07:35.530 --> 03:07:37.570
MATT: "I was hoping."

3844
03:07:37.570 --> 03:07:40.890
LAURA: You should see the wonders they are capable of.

3845
03:07:40.890 --> 03:07:42.281
MATT: "I trust."

3846
03:07:43.597 --> 03:07:46.470
LAURA: I don't think Dairon thinks I'm cool.

3847
03:07:46.470 --> 03:07:49.470
MARISHA: Dairon doesn't think anyone's cool.

3848
03:07:49.470 --> 03:07:50.360
MATT: "It's true."

3849
03:07:51.820 --> 03:07:54.450
MARISHA: It's what happens when you're too cool

3850
03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:57.980
for school.

3851
03:07:57.980 --> 03:08:00.210
SAM: How do we get to Rexxentrum?

3852
03:08:01.160 --> 03:08:02.693
LIAM: I enjoyed school.

3853
03:08:04.858 --> 03:08:08.064
TRAVIS: Would we take a Teleportation Circle?

3854
03:08:08.064 --> 03:08:10.070
SAM: We don't know how, we wouldn't know--

3855
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:11.474
LAURA: We don't have one to Zadash.

3856
03:08:11.474 --> 03:08:13.057
LIAM: We don't have that.

3857
03:08:13.057 --> 03:08:15.326
MARISHA: Where's the nearest one we have to?

3858
03:08:15.326 --> 03:08:17.830
LAURA: We don't have one into the Empire.

3859
03:08:17.830 --> 03:08:19.735
LIAM: No.

3860
03:08:19.735 --> 03:08:21.400
I'm not forgetting one, correct?

3861
03:08:21.400 --> 03:08:22.490
MATT: Into the Empire, no.

3862
03:08:22.490 --> 03:08:27.200
You've only encountered them in Nicodranas, Uthodurn,

3863
03:08:27.200 --> 03:08:28.420
Asarius,

3864
03:08:28.420 --> 03:08:30.080
and Rosohna.
TALIESIN: Nicodranas could,

3865
03:08:30.080 --> 03:08:32.340
might be a good--

3866
03:08:32.340 --> 03:08:33.730
LIAM: Essek could--

3867
03:08:33.730 --> 03:08:35.090
MARISHA: Dairon.
LIAM: -- teleport us.

3868
03:08:35.090 --> 03:08:37.009
MATT: "Yes?"
MARISHA: Does the Cobalt Soul

3869
03:08:37.009 --> 03:08:39.970
have a Teleportation Circle hiding in it?

3870
03:08:39.970 --> 03:08:41.080
MATT: "There is one, yes."

3871
03:08:41.080 --> 03:08:43.040
LAURA: Do you know the symbol?

3872
03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:48.040
MATT: "No, it is not of my bailiwick,

3873
03:08:48.267 --> 03:08:49.653
"I'm sorry."

3874
03:08:49.653 --> 03:08:50.486
MARISHA: That's all right,

3875
03:08:50.486 --> 03:08:52.901
we'll get that when we get back to Zadash.

3876
03:08:54.600 --> 03:08:55.870
SAM: How do we get to Zadash?

3877
03:08:55.870 --> 03:08:57.981
MARISHA: I wouldn't know it, would I?

3878
03:08:57.981 --> 03:08:59.550
MATT: No, no, no, you would not.

3879
03:08:59.550 --> 03:09:01.408
LAURA: We have to go to Nicodranas, I guess,

3880
03:09:01.408 --> 03:09:03.390
and then cross over.

3881
03:09:03.390 --> 03:09:04.440
SAM: That's super far.

3882
03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:05.682
LAURA: Yeah, but that's the only safe way--

3883
03:09:05.682 --> 03:09:07.352
SAM: We could ask for Essek.

3884
03:09:07.352 --> 03:09:09.260
LIAM: Well, Essek could do it again.

3885
03:09:09.260 --> 03:09:13.910
We could stack up the favors that he is owed.

3886
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:16.160
SAM: I mean, we're doing this mission on his

3887
03:09:16.160 --> 03:09:17.025
request.
TALIESIN: I don't know

3888
03:09:17.025 --> 03:09:18.083
if he'd be willing to teleport us

3889
03:09:18.083 --> 03:09:19.092
to the middle of the Empire.

3890
03:09:19.092 --> 03:09:20.431
LAURA: Into the Empire.

3891
03:09:20.431 --> 03:09:23.190
MARISHA: We're asking Essek to go into enemy territory.

3892
03:09:23.190 --> 03:09:26.650
LAURA: I don't think he's going to do it and honestly,

3893
03:09:26.650 --> 03:09:28.660
he seemed a little bit peeved

3894
03:09:28.660 --> 03:09:31.170
that we keep asking him to take us places.

3895
03:09:31.170 --> 03:09:33.670
Like an older sibling or something.

3896
03:09:33.670 --> 03:09:35.400
SAM: You don't even want to ask?

3897
03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:36.910
He can always just say no.

3898
03:09:36.910 --> 03:09:38.990
LIAM: He did say time was of the essence.

3899
03:09:38.990 --> 03:09:41.360
SAM: Yeah, and we can have him take us

3900
03:09:41.360 --> 03:09:45.440
to a totally safe place that's near Rexxentrum.

3901
03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:47.370
LAURA: Do we know of a totally safe place near Rexxentrum?

3902
03:09:47.370 --> 03:09:49.453
SAM: We know Hupperdook.

3903
03:09:51.440 --> 03:09:53.570
It's a few days away, but at least we can go--

3904
03:09:53.570 --> 03:09:54.760
LAURA: Oh, and we can see Kiri.

3905
03:09:54.760 --> 03:09:56.210
SAM: We could go somewhere safe.

3906
03:09:57.360 --> 03:09:58.960
LAURA: We could tel--

3907
03:09:58.960 --> 03:10:02.877
bamf right into the room where Kiri is staying.

3908
03:10:06.170 --> 03:10:09.498
SAM: Or Nogvurot, yeah, we've been there.

3909
03:10:09.498 --> 03:10:11.665
LIAM: Blumenthal.

3910
03:10:11.665 --> 03:10:13.290
SAM and LAURA: Hmm?

3911
03:10:13.290 --> 03:10:14.710
SAM: Blumenthal?

3912
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:17.800
Oh, this is a place close to Rexxentrum that you know.

3913
03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:19.500
A safe place?

3914
03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:21.800
TALIESIN: Nothing's safe.
LIAM: I think so.

3915
03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:23.770
Relatively. It's where I was raised.

3916
03:10:23.770 --> 03:10:27.180
LAURA: This is all, you know, fine and dandy

3917
03:10:27.180 --> 03:10:29.430
that we're trying to figure out where to go,

3918
03:10:29.430 --> 03:10:31.680
but none of it matters if he won't do it.

3919
03:10:31.680 --> 03:10:33.280
SAM: Well, we got to go ask him.

3920
03:10:33.280 --> 03:10:35.720
Oh wait, he just left here, didn't he?

3921
03:10:35.720 --> 03:10:36.553
LAURA: Yeah.

3922
03:10:36.553 --> 03:10:37.510
SAM: Well, call him back.

3923
03:10:37.510 --> 03:10:39.700
LAURA: I can't, I don't have any more Sending spells today.

3924
03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:41.678
SAM: Fucking shit balls.

3925
03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:45.440
TRAVIS: Where are we going, what are we doing?

3926
03:10:45.440 --> 03:10:46.890
SAM: We're going to sleep.

3927
03:10:46.890 --> 03:10:48.250
LAURA: Then, worst case scenario,

3928
03:10:48.250 --> 03:10:51.240
we're bamfing to Nicodranas so we can cross into the Empire.

3929
03:10:51.240 --> 03:10:52.073
TRAVIS: Cool.

3930
03:10:52.073 --> 03:10:55.305
MARISHA: So we are checking in with Essek?

3931
03:10:56.225 --> 03:10:57.280
TALIESIN: I say we do that in the morning.

3932
03:10:57.280 --> 03:10:59.900
Ask if he can bamf and if he can't, then we go--

3933
03:10:59.900 --> 03:11:01.265
LAURA: We do it ourselves.

3934
03:11:01.265 --> 03:11:02.250
MARISHA: Okay.

3935
03:11:02.250 --> 03:11:03.340
LAURA: We are capable.

3936
03:11:03.340 --> 03:11:06.365
MARISHA: We're trying to get to Rexxentrum so we can

3937
03:11:06.365 --> 03:11:07.456
invade--

3938
03:11:07.456 --> 03:11:09.430
SAM: That's where all these people are.

3939
03:11:09.430 --> 03:11:12.470
LIAM: Yeah, we are just trying to guess, I mean, Dairon?

3940
03:11:12.470 --> 03:11:13.803
MATT: "They have homes in Rexxentrum,

3941
03:11:13.803 --> 03:11:16.736
"but they travel all over.

3942
03:11:16.736 --> 03:11:18.320
"I cannot guarantee they will be there."

3943
03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:21.660
SAM: For sure, but that's where, I mean--

3944
03:11:21.660 --> 03:11:24.600
MATT: "The Candles is not a disparate place.

3945
03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:26.660
"Are you familiar or have you been there?"

3946
03:11:26.660 --> 03:11:27.560
SAM: The what?

3947
03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:28.420
MATT: "The Candles."

3948
03:11:28.420 --> 03:11:31.100
LAURA: It's like the fancy district, I bet.

3949
03:11:31.100 --> 03:11:33.740
MATT: "Have you seen the symbol of the Assembly?"

3950
03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:35.833
TRAVIS: No.

3951
03:11:35.833 --> 03:11:36.666
SAM: Yes.

3952
03:11:36.666 --> 03:11:39.833
MATT: You saw it once, you saw it in--
TRAVIS: Yes, once.

3953
03:11:41.941 --> 03:11:45.120
MATT: The Invulnerable Vagrant on the wall.

3954
03:11:45.120 --> 03:11:46.510
LIAM: Oh right, because he is affiliated.

3955
03:11:46.510 --> 03:11:47.440
MATT: He's affiliated and had been doing

3956
03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:48.980
work for the Assembly for awhile.

3957
03:11:48.980 --> 03:11:49.959
MARISHA: That's right.

3958
03:11:49.959 --> 03:11:51.825
MATT: You saw three

3959
03:11:51.825 --> 03:11:53.531
diamond-like shapes that are pointed inward

3960
03:11:53.531 --> 03:11:55.320
towards themselves and then underneath,

3961
03:11:55.320 --> 03:11:59.620
there are eight spires that curl up around it.

3962
03:12:00.860 --> 03:12:02.800
Dairon says "This symbol represents the Candles.

3963
03:12:02.800 --> 03:12:06.002
"The Candles are eight towers that encircle

3964
03:12:07.780 --> 03:12:10.210
"the stronghold."
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3965
03:12:10.210 --> 03:12:11.610
MATT: "Where the King sits.

3966
03:12:12.790 --> 03:12:15.420
"These homes,

3967
03:12:15.420 --> 03:12:19.862
"well they may or may not be under extreme watch.

3968

"One of the most well-guarded and dangerous

03:12:23.050 --> 03:12:26.940
"places to even attempt to break into or skulk around.

"the Assembly doesn't lose many

03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:39.740
"favored antiquities."

3973
03:12:39.740 --> 03:12:42.455
SAM: Well, they lost one to us already.

3974
03:12:42.455 --> 03:12:43.288
MATT: "Mm."

3975
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:46.200
LIAM: I have a DM question.
MATT: Yes?

3976
03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:47.730
LIAM: I'm trying to remember, I'm actually fuzzy

3977
03:12:47.730 --> 03:12:51.680
on my backstory stuff. Was I-- was Caleb trained,

3978
03:12:52.820 --> 03:12:53.920
were they sequestered in one

3979
03:12:53.920 --> 03:12:57.580
of those towers or taken out of town?

3980
03:12:57.580 --> 03:12:59.600
MATT: You were taken out of town.
LIAM: Out of town which,

3981
03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:01.110
and Caleb would know--
MATT: Yes.

3982
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:03.000
LIAM: -- where that is.

3983
03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:06.491
MARISHA: Does the last name Jagentoth ring a bell?

3984
03:13:06.491 --> 03:13:07.960
MATT: "I am familiar with the Jagentoths,

3985
03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:09.710
"yes, from Shadycreek Run."

3986
03:13:11.830 --> 03:13:15.297
MARISHA: Could you think of any other criminal ring,

3987
03:13:15.297 --> 03:13:20.297
including them that might have
contacts with the Cerberus Assembly

3988
03:13:20.390 --> 03:13:23.330
that would move items under secrecy?

3989
03:13:23.330 --> 03:13:24.550
MATT: "It's possible.

3990
03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:28.963
"There are still elements of The Myriad."

3991
03:13:28.963 --> 03:13:30.110
MARISHA: The Myriad.

3992
03:13:30.110 --> 03:13:33.070
MATT: "They were thought destroyed maybe,

3993
03:13:33.070 --> 03:13:36.960
"almost two decades ago, but they still permeate both

3994
03:13:36.960 --> 03:13:40.102
"the Menagerie Coast and the outskirts of the Empire."

3995
03:13:41.820 --> 03:13:42.690
MARISHA: Great.

3996
03:13:42.690 --> 03:13:46.281
MATT: "But those are largely just

3997
03:13:46.281 --> 03:13:49.356
"either rumors or individuals."

3998
03:13:53.530 --> 03:13:55.040
SAM: Let's go to sleep.

3999
03:13:55.040 --> 03:13:56.010
MARISHA: Okay.

4000
03:13:56.010 --> 03:13:58.420
SAM: Contact Essek, see if we can--

4001
03:13:58.420 --> 03:14:01.600
MARISHA: I'm kind of into this Zadash idea,

4002
03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:04.610
speaking as Marisha for a second.

4003
03:14:04.610 --> 03:14:07.560
SAM: But speaking as Nott the Brave, why?

4004
03:14:08.950 --> 03:14:11.333
MARISHA: Zadash, we can check in with--

4005
03:14:11.333 --> 03:14:12.574
Cobalt Reserve is there.

4006
03:14:12.574 --> 03:14:15.098
We can check in with The Gentleman.

4007
03:14:17.738 --> 03:14:20.605
TALIESIN: We do have a better support structure there.

4008
03:14:22.400 --> 03:14:25.340
MARISHA: Going straight to Mordor doesn't seem right.

4009
03:14:25.340 --> 03:14:27.353
TALIESIN: Seems a little--

4010
03:14:28.645 --> 03:14:29.950
seems like eight people running

4011
03:14:29.950 --> 03:14:32.670
at a fully armed castle with eight towers.

4012
03:14:32.670 --> 03:14:34.170
MARISHA: Naruto running at it.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4013
03:14:34.170 --> 03:14:35.920
This feels like a Naruto move.

4014
03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:37.500
LAURA: If it's like super duper,

4015
03:14:37.500 --> 03:14:40.970
super, super duper guarded--
LIAM: To weigh,

4016
03:14:40.970 --> 03:14:42.210
I think that's right, I think,

4017
03:14:42.210 --> 03:14:44.370
speaking, going out of character,

4018
03:14:44.370 --> 03:14:47.360
what Zadash has got going on is that network.

4019
03:14:47.360 --> 03:14:50.880
What I'm talking about outside of Rexxentrum is

4020
03:14:51.750 --> 03:14:54.220
like a home out in the countryside.

4021
03:14:54.220 --> 03:14:55.360
TALIESIN: Okay, like a country--

4022
03:14:55.360 --> 03:14:57.060
LIAM: Away from the city.

4023
03:14:57.060 --> 03:14:59.130
TALIESIN: If it's not in the city,
then that's a whole 'nother--

4024
03:14:59.130 --> 03:15:00.720
LIAM: It's not, it's Trent--

4025
03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:01.950
MARISHA: But then what?

4026
03:15:01.950 --> 03:15:03.860
LAURA: Yeah, but we still don't have allies--

4027
03:15:03.860 --> 03:15:05.510
MARISHA: There.
LAURA: Powerful allies.

4028
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:07.530
LIAM: No, but--
TALIESIN: We could find something.

4029
03:15:07.530 --> 03:15:09.690
LIAM: He could presumably have records or something.

4030
03:15:09.690 --> 03:15:12.470
MARISHA: But we still are breaking into one of Trent's,

4031
03:15:12.470 --> 03:15:14.410
you're pitching breaking into his

4032
03:15:14.410 --> 03:15:16.260
vacation home as opposed to his fortress?

4033
03:15:16.260 --> 03:15:18.960
LIAM: It's not a vacation home, it is where,

4034
03:15:18.960 --> 03:15:20.790
I'm slipping back into character now.

4035
03:15:20.790 --> 03:15:22.265
It is where

4036
03:15:23.500 --> 03:15:24.741
I was made.

4037
03:15:25.977 --> 03:15:26.810
LAURA: Oh.

4038
03:15:26.810 --> 03:15:28.248
TALIESIN: The school.

4039
03:15:28.248 --> 03:15:30.880
LIAM: No, the school is in Rexxentrum, but--

4040
03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:34.150
LAURA: Is it like a secret place?

4041
03:15:34.150 --> 03:15:36.650
LIAM: Ikithon took us away out of town

4042
03:15:36.650 --> 03:15:38.890
for several days a week, every week.

4043
03:15:38.890 --> 03:15:40.510
MARISHA: Camping trip?

4044
03:15:40.510 --> 03:15:41.866
LAURA: Creepy camping trip.

4045
03:15:41.866 --> 03:15:44.000
TALIESIN: It would possibly be something
that wouldn't have a lot of

4046
03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:47.380
connection to the city if he didn't want to be disturbed.

4047
03:15:47.380 --> 03:15:50.672
LIAM: It was his own personal playpen, yeah.

4048
03:15:50.672 --> 03:15:54.660
LAURA: Ew, I don't like him at all. He's so gross!

4049
03:15:54.660 --> 03:15:57.987
TALIESIN: I am now slightly more in favor of this plan.

4050
03:15:59.270 --> 03:16:02.110
MARISHA: I don't know what we're going to find.

4051
03:16:02.110 --> 03:16:04.785
TRAVIS: Well, there's only one way to find out.

4052
03:16:05.668 --> 03:16:06.501
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4053
03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:11.810
TRAVIS: Let's pick a spot and go.

4054
03:16:11.810 --> 03:16:13.950
LAURA: Well, we have to fucking ask Essek first.

4055
03:16:13.950 --> 03:16:16.090
SAM: Let's go to sleep.

4056
03:16:16.090 --> 03:16:17.360
MATT: "Make sure you have all the information

4057
03:16:17.360 --> 03:16:19.214
"before you end up making any big choices."

4058
03:16:19.214 --> 03:16:20.790
SAM: Of course.

4059
03:16:20.790 --> 03:16:22.180
MATT: "Just be careful."

4060
03:16:22.180 --> 03:16:23.020
SAM: Careful planners.

4061
03:16:23.020 --> 03:16:25.610
LAURA: I do have a 4th-level Sending left,

4062
03:16:25.610 --> 03:16:27.110
I mean, a 4th-level spell slot.

4063
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:28.740
So I guess I could use a 4th-level spell.

4064
03:16:28.740 --> 03:16:29.573
SAM: Yes!
TALIESIN: Then you'll sleep anyway.

4065
03:16:29.573 --> 03:16:30.406
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, I'm going to

4066
03:16:30.406 --> 03:16:32.037
send another message to fucking Essek.

4067
03:16:32.037 --> 03:16:33.160
MATT: All right.

4068
03:16:33.160 --> 03:16:36.000
LAURA: Sorry to bother you again.

4069
03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.720
Would you be able to

4070
03:16:38.720 --> 03:16:41.620
provide transport into

4071
03:16:41.620 --> 03:16:44.453
a place within the Empire?

4072
03:16:46.730 --> 03:16:50.278
Is that something you're willing and able?

4073
03:16:54.820 --> 03:16:57.380
MATT: You hear a (yawning).

4074
03:16:57.380 --> 03:16:59.432
LAURA: He was sleeping, I think he was sleeping.

4075
03:16:59.432 --> 03:17:01.140
MATT: "Respectfully,

4076
03:17:02.700 --> 03:17:06.900
"you have a capable arcanist in your midst.

4077
03:17:08.490 --> 03:17:11.137
"I have already shuttled you to places far away."

4078
03:17:11.137 --> 03:17:12.653
LAURA: I knew he was going to say that.

4079
03:17:12.653 --> 03:17:14.330
MATT: "You should not have a problem

4080
03:17:14.330 --> 03:17:17.467
"returning to where you came from, right?"

4081
03:17:18.320 --> 03:17:19.153
SAM: Well...

4082
03:17:21.079 --> 03:17:24.090
TALIESIN: Well, that's the end of your spell session.

4083
03:17:24.090 --> 03:17:25.270
LAURA: No, I've got two more 4th-level.

4084
03:17:25.270 --> 03:17:26.500
I'm going to send a message back.

4085
03:17:26.500 --> 03:17:28.650
For the record, that's totally

4086
03:17:28.650 --> 03:17:30.270
how I was feeling about it, too.

4087
03:17:30.270 --> 03:17:31.800
I was just double-checking, you know?

4088
03:17:31.800 --> 03:17:35.423
Because we needed to check

4089
03:17:35.423 --> 03:17:36.614
because,

4090
03:17:37.758 --> 03:17:39.091
that's it.

4091
03:17:40.003 --> 03:17:41.652
MATT: That was all filler words.

4092
03:17:41.652 --> 03:17:43.320
LAURA: Yes, the whole Sending message was just--

4093
03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:44.670
MATT: "I wish you luck.

4094
03:17:46.740 --> 03:17:51.340
"Let me know should you discover where this beacon may be."

4095
03:17:51.340 --> 03:17:54.690
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send him another message back.

4096
03:17:54.690 --> 03:17:56.073
Yes.

4097
03:17:56.073 --> 03:17:58.323
(laughter)

4098
03:17:59.308 --> 03:18:00.730
We definitely will do that, Essek.

4099
03:18:00.730 --> 03:18:02.650
Also, I hope you have a really good night's sleep

4100
03:18:02.650 --> 03:18:04.460
and thank you for everything today,

4101
03:18:04.460 --> 03:18:07.100
the chair was really cool.

4102
03:18:07.100 --> 03:18:08.645
Sweet dreams.

4103
03:18:09.800 --> 03:18:11.440
That's it.

4104
03:18:11.440 --> 03:18:14.662
MATT: The response comes through, "Hah."

4105
03:18:15.818 --> 03:18:17.891
TRAVIS: That's it?

4106
03:18:17.891 --> 03:18:19.950
MATT: That's it.

4107
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:23.912
That's it.

4108
03:18:26.589 --> 03:18:29.360
SAM: Caleb, can't you get us into the Empire?

4109
03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.370
LIAM: No, I mean, let's go to bed.

4110
03:18:33.370 --> 03:18:35.743
Perhaps they have records here

4111
03:18:37.270 --> 03:18:39.240
of different, no, they wouldn't,

4112
03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:41.090
why would they have records--
LAURA: No.

4113
03:18:41.090 --> 03:18:43.570
We just have to go to Nicodranas and we have

4114
03:18:43.570 --> 03:18:45.870
to fucking travel up, that's the only way to do it.

4115
03:18:45.870 --> 03:18:48.040
(shrilly) We have to go to Nicodranas, we have to travel up.

4116
03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:49.160
That's the way it is, okay?

4117
03:18:49.160 --> 03:18:50.928
Let's go to sleep.

4118
03:18:52.420 --> 03:18:55.907
TALIESIN: Who can argue with that?

4119
03:18:55.907 --> 03:18:57.148
We're not going to find a cheat code

4120
03:18:57.148 --> 03:18:58.481
to where we need to get.

4121
03:18:58.481 --> 03:19:02.910
Yeah, there's no cheat code to get there.

4122
03:19:02.910 --> 03:19:05.380
I'm fine with Nicodranas, I got no problem with Nicodranas.

4123
03:19:05.380 --> 03:19:08.350
SAM: It's going to take forever.

4124
03:19:08.350 --> 03:19:09.690
LAURA: We don't have a cheat code, Nott.

4125
03:19:09.690 --> 03:19:12.090
SAM: That's thousands of miles away.

4126
03:19:12.090 --> 03:19:13.460
TALIESIN: What's your thought, then?

4127
03:19:13.460 --> 03:19:16.270
SAM: I feel like we're closer here than Nicodranas.

4128
03:19:16.270 --> 03:19:18.600
LAURA: Yeah, but we have to cross through battle territory.

4129
03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:21.170
We can't do that.
MARISHA: This border is contested.

4130
03:19:21.170 --> 03:19:24.310
That one, not as much.
LIAM: War zone.

4131
03:19:24.310 --> 03:19:27.110
MARISHA: Unless we go back to Uthodurn. Is Uthodurn closer?

4132
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:28.200
MATT: If you'll look at your maps,

4133
03:19:28.200 --> 03:19:32.330
you can see which is closer, Rosohna or Nicodranas.

4134
03:19:32.330 --> 03:19:33.500
LAURA: Okay, let's do that.
MATT: Mister map keeper.

4135
03:19:33.500 --> 03:19:34.571
SAM: Which is closer, map man?

4136
03:19:34.571 --> 03:19:36.480
TRAVIS: Rosohna is closer.

4137
03:19:36.480 --> 03:19:38.220
LAURA: Wait, what about Uthodurn?

4138
03:19:38.220 --> 03:19:39.344
TRAVIS: That's further.

4139
03:19:39.344 --> 03:19:41.010
SAM: Yeah, what about Uthodurn?
LAURA: Obviously, Rosohna's closer.

4140
03:19:41.010 --> 03:19:42.470
TRAVIS: Nicodranas is the farthest one.

4141
03:19:42.470 --> 03:19:43.580
MARISHA: Uthodurn, we don't have to cross

4142
03:19:43.580 --> 03:19:47.650
enemy territory and Nicodranas, we don't have to--

4143
03:19:47.650 --> 03:19:49.350
TRAVIS: Sorry, there are four maps, give me a minute.

4144
03:19:49.350 --> 03:19:51.508
TALIESIN: The northern border is also less of a problem,

4145
03:19:51.508 --> 03:19:53.044
if I recall.

4146
03:19:53.044 --> 03:19:53.877
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying. Uthodurn,

4147
03:19:53.877 --> 03:19:54.968
we just drop down.

4148
03:19:54.968 --> 03:19:56.917
Nicodranas, we go up.

4149
03:19:56.917 --> 03:19:58.842
TRAVIS: This is Rosohna.

4150
03:19:59.830 --> 03:20:01.794
TALIESIN: This is what one week away does to us.

4151
03:20:01.794 --> 03:20:04.042
TRAVIS: This is Uthodurn.
TALIESIN: All right.

4152
03:20:10.221 --> 03:20:11.700
SAM: Oh, boy.

4153
03:20:11.700 --> 03:20:14.317
LAURA: You guys, this is a big world, okay?

4154
03:20:14.317 --> 03:20:17.160
SAM: Matt, can you make your next world smaller?

4155
03:20:17.160 --> 03:20:18.670
MATT: No.

4156
03:20:18.670 --> 03:20:21.450
LAURA: Nah.
MATT: So that goes there.

4157
03:20:21.450 --> 03:20:22.610
LAURA: Ooh, this is cool, though.

4158
03:20:22.610 --> 03:20:25.646
I'm actually excited about this happening right now.

4159
03:20:25.646 --> 03:20:28.990
MATT: Then this here.

4160
03:20:28.990 --> 03:20:30.250
So,

4161
03:20:30.250 --> 03:20:32.339
Nicodranas.

4162
03:20:32.339 --> 03:20:34.696
There you go, Nicodranas is there

4163
03:20:34.696 --> 03:20:36.761
and this is the Empire's space.

4164
03:20:36.761 --> 03:20:38.250
This is Rosohna.

4165
03:20:38.250 --> 03:20:42.460
LAURA: It's about equidistant to get up to Rexxentrum.

4166
03:20:42.460 --> 03:20:45.490
LIAM: From Nicodranas, this is smaller than this

4167
03:20:45.490 --> 03:20:47.680
really though glued to here, isn't it?

4168
03:20:47.680 --> 03:20:49.159
MATT: A little bit.

4169
03:20:49.159 --> 03:20:51.125
LAURA: Then where's Uthodurn?

4170
03:20:51.125 --> 03:20:54.625
MATT: Uthodurn is

4171
03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:57.980
up here.

4172
03:20:57.980 --> 03:20:59.910
SAM: They're all the same fucking distance.

4173
03:20:59.910 --> 03:21:02.620
MATT: They're actually all a pretty similar distance.

4174
03:21:02.620 --> 03:21:07.178
LIAM: Fuck you, Rexxentrum, you're right in the middle.

4175
03:21:07.178 --> 03:21:09.256
MATT: I don't know how that worked out, but it did.

4176
03:21:10.683 --> 03:21:11.766
Look at that.

4177
03:21:13.944 --> 03:21:15.411
All righty.

4178
03:21:17.135 --> 03:21:18.193
LIAM: I agree with Jester, we should

4179
03:21:18.193 --> 03:21:21.830
go to Nicodranas and just get it over with.

4180
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:23.026
LAURA: Okay.

4181
03:21:23.026 --> 03:21:23.859
MARISHA: If we go through Nicodranas,

4182
03:21:23.859 --> 03:21:25.970
we can stop in Zadash on the way.

4183
03:21:25.970 --> 03:21:27.620
LAURA: Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun!

4184
03:21:27.620 --> 03:21:30.780
TALIESIN: We can also set up the trip to Traveler Con.

4185
03:21:31.860 --> 03:21:34.050
LAURA: This is true.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4186
03:21:34.050 --> 03:21:35.160
SAM: We sleep.

4187
03:21:35.160 --> 03:21:36.020
MATT: All right.

4188
03:21:36.020 --> 03:21:37.203
SAM: We wake.

4189
03:21:38.118 --> 03:21:39.670
LIAM: Caleb spends two hours working

4190
03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:41.500
on the higher level dunamancy spell before bed.

4191
03:21:41.500 --> 03:21:43.730
MATT: You got it, get that inscribed into your book.

4192
03:21:43.730 --> 03:21:46.280
LIAM: It takes some time, but two hours.

4193
03:21:46.280 --> 03:21:47.581
MATT: As you're going to sleep--

4194
03:21:47.581 --> 03:21:48.414
LAURA: Mm!

4195
03:21:50.300 --> 03:21:53.360
MATT: You curl up in bed and you feel

4196
03:21:53.360 --> 03:21:56.690
something shift at the foot of the bed

4197
03:21:56.690 --> 03:21:58.030
and you look over and you see sitting

4198
03:21:58.030 --> 03:22:01.200
at the edge of the bed, a familiar green cloak.

4199
03:22:01.200 --> 03:22:02.280
LAURA: I sit up.

4200
03:22:02.280 --> 03:22:04.830
MATT: He turns back towards you.

4201
03:22:06.520 --> 03:22:10.543
"So what do you think, Kravaraad or Rumblecusp?"

4202
03:22:11.650 --> 03:22:12.483
LAURA: Well--

4203
03:22:12.483 --> 03:22:15.320
MATT: "I know you said your preference may have been

4204
03:22:15.320 --> 03:22:19.050
"with the new volcano, but you seemed

4205
03:22:19.050 --> 03:22:21.190
"less intrigued the last time we spoke."

4206
03:22:21.190 --> 03:22:23.420
LAURA: Yeah, I don't know.

4207
03:22:23.420 --> 03:22:25.650
I thought it was going to be cooler than it was.

4208
03:22:25.650 --> 03:22:28.815
I mean, don't get me wrong, it was really cool, but

4209
03:22:29.870 --> 03:22:31.528
it kind of felt like

4210
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:35.060
the Wildmother's territory,

4211
03:22:35.060 --> 03:22:38.595
if that makes any sense. And, like,

4212
03:22:40.390 --> 03:22:42.090
why would we want to go somewhere

4213
03:22:42.090 --> 03:22:45.000
that's already been stamped upon by somebody else?

4214
03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:48.540
Why can we go and claim something as our own, you know?

4215
03:22:48.540 --> 03:22:51.140
Plus it's, you know,

4216
03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:53.440
it's barren there and we haven't

4217
03:22:53.440 --> 03:22:56.330
been to anywhere tropical in awhile.

4218
03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:57.820
MATT: "So tropical?"

4219
03:22:57.820 --> 03:22:59.420
LAURA: Is the other place tropical?

4220
03:22:59.420 --> 03:23:00.820
I am assuming.

4221
03:23:02.340 --> 03:23:05.860
MATT: "It's fairly tropical, as an island.

4222
03:23:05.860 --> 03:23:06.830
"Let's do that."

4223
03:23:06.830 --> 03:23:09.120
LAURA: What is it like, what should we do?

4224
03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:10.820
What are we going to do there?

4225
03:23:10.820 --> 03:23:12.920
MATT: "Well, we'll figure this out as we

4226
03:23:12.920 --> 03:23:14.403
"get closer to the dates.

4227
03:23:14.403 --> 03:23:17.650
"What kind of things should we prepare?"

4228
03:23:17.650 --> 03:23:20.620
LAURA: I already told everyone that I would make them

4229
03:23:20.620 --> 03:23:22.550
Traveler cloaks so that they could all

4230
03:23:22.550 --> 03:23:26.950
look really fancy when they're worshiping you.

4231
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:28.670
MATT: "I'm sure they'd appreciate that."

4232
03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:32.550
LAURA: Do you want me to make like lots of idols to you

4233
03:23:32.550 --> 03:23:36.110
or do I need to get word out to the rest of your followers?

4234
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:37.440
Do they already know?

4235
03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:39.140
MATT: "They've all been notified."

4236
03:23:39.140 --> 03:23:40.406
LAURA: Okay.

4237
03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:45.423
MATT: "Any trinket you wish to bring along, of course."

4238
03:23:46.270 --> 03:23:49.320
LAURA: I'll make sure there's some good stuff.

4239
03:23:49.320 --> 03:23:50.900
MATT: "Your friends are coming, yes?"

4240
03:23:50.900 --> 03:23:53.518
LAURA: That's the plan, is that okay?

4241
03:23:53.518 --> 03:23:54.351
MATT: "Yeah."

4242
03:23:54.351 --> 03:23:56.984
LAURA: They're not in any danger, right?

4243
03:23:56.984 --> 03:23:57.850
MATT: "No."

4244
03:23:57.850 --> 03:23:58.959
LAURA: Okay.

4245
03:23:58.959 --> 03:24:00.435
I don't know why I was asking that.

4246
03:24:00.435 --> 03:24:01.840
I just guessed like, you know,

4247
03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:03.530
you think volcano, you think somebody's

4248
03:24:03.530 --> 03:24:06.620
going to be sacrificed or something and that seems weird.

4249
03:24:06.620 --> 03:24:08.230
MATT: "That's definitely not my--"

4250
03:24:09.100 --> 03:24:10.233
LAURA: Right?
MATT: "-- realm of

4251
03:24:10.233 --> 03:24:12.008
"preference or expertise.

4252
03:24:14.680 --> 03:24:17.263
"I'm looking forward to this."
LAURA: Me too.

4253
03:24:20.120 --> 03:24:22.730
I miss hanging out with you.

4254
03:24:22.730 --> 03:24:23.980
MATT: "I'm never that far."

4255
03:24:23.980 --> 03:24:26.020
LAURA: Well, I know, but

4256
03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:28.890
I know.

4257
03:24:28.890 --> 03:24:32.150
It's weird that nobody else can see you.

4258
03:24:32.150 --> 03:24:34.146
MATT: "Faith's a funny thing."

4259
03:24:34.146 --> 03:24:35.487
LAURA: Yeah.

4260
03:24:37.590 --> 03:24:41.530
MATT: "But if you ever get lonely, just call.

4261
03:24:41.530 --> 03:24:43.360
"Call my name."

4262
03:24:43.360 --> 03:24:44.920
LAURA: Okay.

4263
03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:49.517
MATT: "And know that if I'm not there, I'm thinking of you."

4264
03:24:51.210 --> 03:24:53.460
LAURA: All right, you don't know anything about

4265
03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:56.260
this weird beacon thing we're going to look for, do you?

4266
03:24:57.150 --> 03:24:59.362
It's got everybody up in arms.

4267
03:25:00.373 --> 03:25:02.623
(laughter)

4268
03:25:06.220 --> 03:25:09.328
MATT: "It's certainly intriguing, that's for sure.

4269
03:25:12.740 --> 03:25:14.790
"I'm as curious as you are."

4270
03:25:14.790 --> 03:25:16.440
LAURA: Yeah.

4271
03:25:16.440 --> 03:25:19.407
MATT: "Maybe not so much to be up in arms, but

4272
03:25:20.784 --> 03:25:22.163
"I'm certainly curious."

4273
03:25:22.163 --> 03:25:23.513
LAURA: It does some cool things.

4274
03:25:24.760 --> 03:25:27.830
Dunamancy's crazy. Did you see that guy get squished?

4275
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:29.680
I mean I guess she was a girl, but...

4276
03:25:34.155 --> 03:25:34.988
MATT: "Well,

4277
03:25:36.920 --> 03:25:38.650
"I'll continue with my preparation."

4278
03:25:38.650 --> 03:25:40.390
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "It's getting close."

4279
03:25:40.390 --> 03:25:43.410
LAURA: I know, we're so close, I'm like so excited.

4280
03:25:43.410 --> 03:25:45.770
MATT: "Me too, very much so.

4281
03:25:45.770 --> 03:25:48.830
"I'm excited for you to meet the rest of your brethren."

4282
03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:50.480
LAURA: Me too.

4283
03:25:53.700 --> 03:25:55.850
MATT: "Thank you, Jester."

4284
03:25:55.850 --> 03:25:58.520
LAURA: Thank you.

4285
03:25:58.520 --> 03:25:59.770
MATT: "Sleep well."

4286
03:25:59.770 --> 03:26:02.270
He runs the hand over the side of your head.

4287
03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:06.200
LAURA: Good night.

4288
03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:08.070
MATT: You turn around and nestle into

4289
03:26:08.070 --> 03:26:10.853
your pillow and look back and he's gone.

4290
03:26:16.117 --> 03:26:18.483
LIAM: I just envisioned Santa Con.

4291
03:26:19.820 --> 03:26:22.960
MATT: Apparently, it's part of the plan here.

4292
03:26:27.390 --> 03:26:28.863
Oh, wow.

4293
03:26:28.863 --> 03:26:31.685
All right, the next morning comes to you.

4294
03:26:31.685 --> 03:26:35.115
The familiar darkened mornings of Rosohna.

4295
03:26:36.244 --> 03:26:37.880
You come to consciousness, eat your breakfast

4296
03:26:37.880 --> 03:26:39.530
and have your day's plans about you.

4297
03:26:39.530 --> 03:26:41.222
What would you like to do?

4298
03:26:42.419 --> 03:26:43.312
LAURA: Caleb.

4299
03:26:43.312 --> 03:26:44.383
LIAM: Yeah?
LAURA: Are you ready?

4300
03:26:46.370 --> 03:26:48.480
LIAM: Yeah.

4301
03:26:48.480 --> 03:26:50.097
Yeah, I'm sorry.

4302
03:26:50.097 --> 03:26:51.750
MATT: Is there anything you'd like to do before you leave?

4303
03:26:51.750 --> 03:26:56.320
SAM: You want to just scry on that Vence guy one more time?

4304
03:26:56.320 --> 03:26:58.140
LAURA: I can try.

4305
03:26:58.140 --> 03:27:01.050
Sure, I'll try to scry on him one more time.

4306
03:27:01.050 --> 03:27:04.120
Although if he's as up high as he is,

4307
03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:06.895
I'm surprised I got any scrys in at all.

4308
03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:11.760
All right, Traveler, here we go again.

4309
03:27:11.760 --> 03:27:13.966
LIAM: I start drawing while she does this.

4310
03:27:13.966 --> 03:27:14.799
MATT: Okay.

4311
03:27:17.144 --> 03:27:18.800
MARISHA: What was that, what does that mean?

4312
03:27:18.800 --> 03:27:20.381
Is that a good Matt or a bad roll?
TALIESIN: I can't tell if that's

4313
03:27:20.381 --> 03:27:22.723
a good Matt smile or a bad Matt smile.

4314
03:27:22.723 --> 03:27:25.330
LIAM: Everybody's going to die.

4315
03:27:25.330 --> 03:27:28.381
MATT: The Traveler sits across from you

4316
03:27:28.381 --> 03:27:30.710
with your hands in his, facing the hood,

4317
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:34.210
obscuring everything but the jaw and the smile

4318
03:27:34.210 --> 03:27:36.390
and the head cocks to one side and goes,

4319
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:40.370
"Not this one."

4320
03:27:40.370 --> 03:27:41.384
LAURA: I figured.

4321
03:27:41.384 --> 03:27:42.675
MATT: It was a natural 20.

4322
03:27:44.025 --> 03:27:45.483
LAURA: Worth a shot.

4323
03:27:46.420 --> 03:27:47.798
MARISHA: Dairon.

4324
03:27:47.798 --> 03:27:50.440
You need anything else before we go?

4325
03:27:50.440 --> 03:27:54.170
You need some sort of like written note?

4326
03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:56.310
MATT: "No, I think I am doing okay

4327
03:27:56.310 --> 03:27:58.920
"getting around by my preferred means.

4328
03:28:01.750 --> 03:28:03.133
"Quietly.

4329
03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:11.290
"Besides, should I need a note, I can always forge it.

4330
03:28:14.690 --> 03:28:19.690
"You all have very interesting handwriting, by the way."

4331
03:28:19.780 --> 03:28:22.203
LAURA: Don't be creepy, Dairon.

4332
03:28:22.203 --> 03:28:24.649
TALIESIN: It's a trick question. I don't have handwriting.

4333
03:28:24.649 --> 03:28:27.200
LAURA: (laughs)

4334
03:28:27.200 --> 03:28:28.660
MATT: "It was."

4335
03:28:28.660 --> 03:28:32.260
LIAM: The collection of

4336
03:28:32.260 --> 03:28:34.230
Xhorhasian cat figurines

4337
03:28:34.230 --> 03:28:35.950
that are in my room, I remember exactly

4338
03:28:35.950 --> 03:28:38.240
how they are laid out and I don't like them

4339
03:28:38.240 --> 03:28:40.810
changed around and I will know if they have been.

4340
03:28:40.810 --> 03:28:43.180
So will you please leave them be?

4341
03:28:43.180 --> 03:28:45.650
MATT: "I will guarantee you they will

4342
03:28:45.650 --> 03:28:49.113
"most likely be somewhat close to their original position."

4343
03:28:50.450 --> 03:28:52.147
TALIESIN: You collect porcelain cats?

4344
03:28:52.147 --> 03:28:54.200
LIAM: Hummel figurines.

4345
03:28:54.200 --> 03:28:55.850
TALIESIN: That was Taliesin talking, not,

4346
03:28:58.411 --> 03:28:59.244
wait, what?

4347
03:28:59.244 --> 03:29:01.600
Okay, this changes everything, thank you, back, okay.

4348
03:29:01.600 --> 03:29:04.707
LAURA: I've left a secret for you in my room.

4349
03:29:05.633 --> 03:29:08.491
I hope you find it.
LIAM: It's a pooper.

4350
03:29:10.570 --> 03:29:14.640
MARISHA: Dairon, can I talk to you in private for a second?

4351
03:29:14.640 --> 03:29:16.320
MATT: "Certainly."

4352
03:29:16.320 --> 03:29:17.230
As Dairon follows you--

4353
03:29:17.230 --> 03:29:19.710
MARISHA: I'm not going to show you to a pooper, I swear.

4354
03:29:19.710 --> 03:29:21.640
MATT: As soon as Dairon walks with you out of the room,

4355
03:29:21.640 --> 03:29:23.660
Dairon looks back at Jester with like a...

4356
03:29:28.350 --> 03:29:29.780
MARISHA: Are we behind closed doors?

4357
03:29:29.780 --> 03:29:30.780
MATT: If you want to, yeah.

4358
03:29:32.700 --> 03:29:34.020
MARISHA: I peek open the door.

4359
03:29:34.020 --> 03:29:35.720
Are any of these fuckers listening?

4360
03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:38.623
SAM and MATT: Nope.
MARISHA: Okay.

4361
03:29:42.757 --> 03:29:44.901
If you fucking tell anyone I did this,

4362
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:50.050
I'll beat your fucking ass, okay?

4363
03:29:50.050 --> 03:29:50.883
MATT: "Okay."

4364
03:29:50.883 --> 03:29:55.442
MARISHA: I'm going against all better judgment in my head

4365
03:29:55.442 --> 03:29:57.312
that I should do this.

4366
03:30:00.420 --> 03:30:05.413
You use this for emergency situations only.

4367
03:30:07.960 --> 03:30:12.842
Only and if you need to, I know you know how to look like

4368
03:30:14.320 --> 03:30:16.173
some other one of us,

4369
03:30:17.800 --> 03:30:20.270
which might buy a little bit more validity to all of it.

4370
03:30:20.270 --> 03:30:21.103
TRAVIS: What?

4371
03:30:21.103 --> 03:30:23.707
MARISHA: But you had better not fucking use it.

4372
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:27.124
And I pull out the symbol of the Bright Queen

4373
03:30:27.124 --> 03:30:28.367
that I have.
LAURA: No.

4374
03:30:28.367 --> 03:30:29.400
MARISHA: And hand it over to her.

4375
03:30:29.400 --> 03:30:31.650
LAURA: Oh my god!

4376
03:30:31.650 --> 03:30:32.483
LIAM: Sick.

4377
03:30:33.374 --> 03:30:35.950
I'm fully in support of it.

4378
03:30:35.950 --> 03:30:37.930
MARISHA: I want it back.

4379
03:30:37.930 --> 03:30:39.505
It's a fucking lender.

4380
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:43.220
TRAVIS: It's not a fucking beer cozy.

4381
03:30:44.995 --> 03:30:47.673
TALIESIN: This is like some Dude, Where's My Car? shit.

4382
03:30:47.673 --> 03:30:50.918
MATT: You see a smile crawl across Dairon's face.

4383
03:30:50.918 --> 03:30:52.530
MARISHA: You know how to look like Fjord.

4384
03:30:52.530 --> 03:30:54.680
People like him, he's charming

4385
03:30:54.680 --> 03:30:57.110
but don't fucking abuse that shit, okay?

4386
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:59.852
Realistically, just don't use it.

4387
03:31:00.808 --> 03:31:01.994
I don't know, they might have some sort

4388
03:31:01.994 --> 03:31:05.668
of like registry noting all people that has those

4389
03:31:05.668 --> 03:31:09.395
and you're not one of them, so, like, don't use it, but

4390
03:31:09.395 --> 03:31:13.280
you have it.

4391
03:31:14.490 --> 03:31:18.107
MATT: "Any other lessons you wish to
impart upon me, teacher?"

4392
03:31:19.982 --> 03:31:21.918
MARISHA: I just felt like I had to be stern in that point.

4393
03:31:23.470 --> 03:31:24.903
MATT: "It's appreciated.

4394
03:31:24.903 --> 03:31:28.350
"I will take much care, and thank you.

4395
03:31:28.350 --> 03:31:33.310
"I think this will definitely aid me in my endeavors."

4396
03:31:37.870 --> 03:31:40.667
MARISHA: Just tell them we like made out or something, okay?

4397
03:31:40.667 --> 03:31:42.100
And then I leave.

4398
03:31:42.100 --> 03:31:43.500
MATT: As you go to leave, she grabs

4399
03:31:43.500 --> 03:31:48.308
your arm and goes "Beauregard, don't die."

4400
03:31:49.244 --> 03:31:52.580
MARISHA: You tell me that every time,
and I haven't forgotten.

4401
03:31:52.580 --> 03:31:54.830
MATT: "So far, so good, so I'll keep telling you that,"

4402
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:56.930
and releases you.

4403
03:31:58.500 --> 03:31:59.610
SAM: All right, ready for the trip?

4404
03:31:59.610 --> 03:32:01.427
TALIESIN: Shagging your way through this game.

4405
03:32:01.427 --> 03:32:04.385
LIAM: (swooshing)

4406
03:32:04.385 --> 03:32:05.728
SAM: Let's go!

4407
03:32:05.728 --> 03:32:06.767
MARISHA: Women can do it do.

4408
03:32:06.767 --> 03:32:08.467
LIAM: Are we ready?
SAM: Yes, we're ready.

4409
03:32:10.480 --> 03:32:12.900
MATT: All right, you craft the Circle, all of you leap in.

4410
03:32:12.900 --> 03:32:15.390
The familiar scents of being pulled

4411
03:32:15.390 --> 03:32:18.340
through this strange arcane tether,

4412
03:32:18.340 --> 03:32:20.430
through a dark space and then you all

4413
03:32:20.430 --> 03:32:23.440
gather your feet under the stone floor

4414
03:32:23.440 --> 03:32:25.920
within Yussa's tower in Nicodranas.

4415
03:32:25.920 --> 03:32:28.320
LIAM: Oh, we didn't message him in advance again.

4416
03:32:28.320 --> 03:32:30.320
LAURA: I'll send him a message.

4417
03:32:30.320 --> 03:32:31.650
LIAM: Do it right now.

4418
03:32:31.650 --> 03:32:33.140
LAURA: I'm going to send him a message.

4419
03:32:33.140 --> 03:32:36.130
Hey, we're going to be at your house here.

4420
03:32:36.130 --> 03:32:38.460
Real soon we're going to pop in, okay?

4421
03:32:38.460 --> 03:32:39.490
We're just letting you know

4422
03:32:39.490 --> 03:32:42.710
in advance before we get there.

4423
03:32:42.710 --> 03:32:44.170
SAM: This message might take a while.

4424
03:32:44.170 --> 03:32:45.440
LAURA: This message could take

4425
03:32:45.440 --> 03:32:47.770
a while to get to you because we're--

4426
03:32:47.770 --> 03:32:49.781
TALIESIN: Beep.
LAURA: Running.

4427
03:32:49.781 --> 03:32:52.031
(laughter)

4428
03:32:53.840 --> 03:32:55.120
MATT: All righty.

4429
03:32:55.120 --> 03:32:56.253
TALIESIN: It's so good.

4430
03:32:56.253 --> 03:32:58.350
MARISHA: I hate it when the service
doesn't send the message.

4431
03:32:58.350 --> 03:33:00.340
TALIESIN: Oh man, it was just like caught in a--

4432
03:33:00.340 --> 03:33:01.630
MARISHA: Just caught in a--

4433
03:33:01.630 --> 03:33:02.890
TALIESIN: In a thing.
MARISHA: In a loop.

4434
03:33:02.890 --> 03:33:05.007
TRAVIS: But it says four bars!

4435
03:33:07.050 --> 03:33:08.390
Why?

4436
03:33:08.390 --> 03:33:10.190
MATT: "I do appreciate your

4437
03:33:12.260 --> 03:33:13.901
"brief heads up.

4438
03:33:15.075 --> 03:33:17.167
"I will send Wentsworth for you.

4439
03:33:19.090 --> 03:33:21.248
"Please be patient, I am busy."

4440
03:33:22.440 --> 03:33:24.690
A few moments pass and the door opens

4441
03:33:24.690 --> 03:33:28.750
and you see the familiar face of the older goblin

4442
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:32.210
with his belly poking across his well-tailored pants.

4443
03:33:33.180 --> 03:33:34.700
Kind of putting the glasses up.

4444
03:33:34.700 --> 03:33:35.840
LAURA: Right when he comes to the door,

4445
03:33:35.840 --> 03:33:38.950
I jump and land like we had just got there.

4446
03:33:38.950 --> 03:33:42.550
SAM: Oh, we just got here. Crazy timing.

4447
03:33:42.550 --> 03:33:44.587
MATT: "Right, of course.

4448
03:33:45.970 --> 03:33:47.672
"Do you require

4449
03:33:49.367 --> 03:33:52.130
"a meeting with the master or are you just passing through?"

4450
03:33:52.130 --> 03:33:54.420
LIAM and LAURA: Just passing through.

4451
03:33:54.420 --> 03:33:56.300
SAM: He told us that he was here, though,

4452
03:33:56.300 --> 03:33:58.100
on the premises though, is that right?

4453
03:33:58.100 --> 03:33:59.670
LAURA: He said he's busy though, he's busy.

4454
03:33:59.670 --> 03:34:01.530
MATT: "Certainly yes, he is."

4455
03:34:01.530 --> 03:34:05.620
TALIESIN: I mean do we want to ask about the beacon?

4456
03:34:06.556 --> 03:34:07.810
MARISHA: We could go check in while we're here.

4457
03:34:07.810 --> 03:34:08.880
TALIESIN: At some point, we could check in.

4458
03:34:08.880 --> 03:34:10.650
LAURA: He says he's busy, it could take a while.

4459
03:34:10.650 --> 03:34:13.180
LIAM: We would have to come back.
He doesn't want to speak now.

4460
03:34:13.180 --> 03:34:14.660
Maybe we could go--

4461
03:34:14.660 --> 03:34:16.180
MATT: You did very much just jump

4462
03:34:16.180 --> 03:34:17.705
right in the middle of his day.

4463
03:34:17.705 --> 03:34:19.166
LAURA: Yeah.

4464
03:34:19.166 --> 03:34:20.760
MARISHA: We could be here for--

4465
03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:21.697
SAM: We'll come back.

4466
03:34:21.697 --> 03:34:23.050
TALIESIN: A day while we figure things out, yeah.

4467
03:34:23.050 --> 03:34:25.930
MATT: Which actually, all right.

4468
03:34:25.930 --> 03:34:28.780
Wentsworth leads you downstairs

4469
03:34:28.780 --> 03:34:30.860
and out of the tower through the familiar exit.

4470
03:34:30.860 --> 03:34:33.550
It is still night in Nicodranas.

4471
03:34:33.550 --> 03:34:35.170
LAURA and SAM: Ooh.

4472
03:34:35.170 --> 03:34:36.003
TALIESIN: Nice.

4473
03:34:37.880 --> 03:34:38.713
LIAM: What time is it?

4474
03:34:38.713 --> 03:34:41.547
LAURA: Are we still possibly in trouble here?

4475
03:34:41.547 --> 03:34:42.832
I don't remember.

4476
03:34:44.010 --> 03:34:45.890
SAM: It's like 4:00 in the morning or 5:00 in the morning.

4477
03:34:45.890 --> 03:34:48.680
LAURA: Okay, okay, so we're fine.

4478
03:34:48.680 --> 03:34:50.310
MATT: You gather the time right now in Nicodranas,

4479
03:34:50.310 --> 03:34:52.640
and I'm ballparking here based on early

4480
03:34:52.640 --> 03:34:56.510
morning leaving there, it's probably somewhere

4481
03:34:56.510 --> 03:35:00.385
in the neighborhood of, I'd say,

4482
03:35:00.385 --> 03:35:03.604
1:00 or 2:00 in the morning.

4483
03:35:03.604 --> 03:35:05.920
LIAM: Almost the middle of the night, but not quite.

4484
03:35:07.190 --> 03:35:08.220
MATT: Actually no, depending on

4485
03:35:08.220 --> 03:35:09.390
what time in the morning you guys left.

4486
03:35:09.390 --> 03:35:10.440
I'd say you left a little later in the morning.

4487
03:35:10.440 --> 03:35:12.690
So I'd say you're about to hit dawn.

4488
03:35:12.690 --> 03:35:13.640
TALIESIN: Perfect.

4489
03:35:15.690 --> 03:35:17.550
SAM: Well, what do we do now?

4490
03:35:18.810 --> 03:35:19.960
LIAM: There's not much we can do

4491
03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:22.920
except maybe go to your mother's.

4492
03:35:22.920 --> 03:35:25.110
What are we going to do before the sun is up?

4493
03:35:26.060 --> 03:35:28.580
TALIESIN: Check in with mom, get the,

4494
03:35:28.580 --> 03:35:30.780
start getting the shit together.
LAURA: See your fam.

4495
03:35:30.780 --> 03:35:32.490
SAM: I'm all for that.

4496
03:35:32.490 --> 03:35:33.960
MARISHA: Check in with Orly.

4497
03:35:33.960 --> 03:35:34.793
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4498
03:35:34.793 --> 03:35:37.730
LIAM: Family, family, Orly, Yussa, arrange for travel.

4499
03:35:37.730 --> 03:35:40.625
LAURA: Oh man, do we have any gem dust yet?

4500
03:35:42.700 --> 03:35:44.580
MARISHA: We have gems, right?

4501
03:35:44.580 --> 03:35:47.450
LAURA and MARISHA: We can crush it.

4502
03:35:47.450 --> 03:35:49.400
TALIESIN: Crush gems.

4503
03:35:49.400 --> 03:35:51.753
MARISHA: I have a jeweler's kit.

4504
03:35:52.680 --> 03:35:54.870
MATT: So you would probably be able
to crush gems pretty well.

4505
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:58.540
LAURA: We have 2500 gold worth of gems.

4506
03:35:58.540 --> 03:36:01.120
MARISHA: 2500 gold's worth of gems?

4507
03:36:01.120 --> 03:36:03.950
TRAVIS: The gems are better served for other--

4508
03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:06.010
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah, everything--
LAURA: Is it?

4509
03:36:06.010 --> 03:36:08.511
Do you know what he can do with it?

4510
03:36:08.511 --> 03:36:11.160
It's really fucking cool.

4511
03:36:11.160 --> 03:36:14.070
I was saving up my money, but I just--

4512
03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:18.020
MATT: Where can we go to get horses and carts and things?

4513
03:36:18.020 --> 03:36:21.150
LAURA: Oh well, the horses are carts are over here.

4514
03:36:21.150 --> 03:36:22.880
I know, he's awake!

4515
03:36:22.880 --> 03:36:24.910
MATT: There's plenty of, there's places you know.

4516
03:36:24.910 --> 03:36:26.960
There are liveries and all kinds of other

4517
03:36:29.080 --> 03:36:31.110
places to pick up beasts of burden,

4518
03:36:31.110 --> 03:36:34.630
to pick up riding horses, to pick up anything in that regard

4519
03:36:34.630 --> 03:36:37.430
and you've made the journey to and from Nicodranas

4520
03:36:38.370 --> 03:36:40.480
and from the Empire many times, so you can,

4521
03:36:40.480 --> 03:36:44.332
you know the faster routes and the elements there.

4522
03:36:44.332 --> 03:36:45.523
SAM: Okay.

4523
03:36:45.523 --> 03:36:47.000
MARISHA: Let's go check in with mom.

4524
03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:49.370
LIAM: Yeah, we'll kill a couple hours 'til the sun comes up.

4525
03:36:49.370 --> 03:36:51.220
Mom works later, right?

4526
03:36:51.220 --> 03:36:55.380
LAURA: Yeah, she's awake. She's for sure awake right now.

4527
03:36:55.380 --> 03:36:57.440
MARISHA: As we're walking to the Lavish Chateau,

4528
03:36:58.740 --> 03:37:00.960
I keep an eye out for any owls.

4529
03:37:02.210 --> 03:37:05.212
MATT: Okay, make a perception check for me, please.

4530
03:37:05.212 --> 03:37:06.458
LIAM: Come on.

4531
03:37:08.400 --> 03:37:11.130
Nope, you are rolling shit tonight.

4532
03:37:11.130 --> 03:37:13.230
MARISHA: Five total.

4533
03:37:13.230 --> 03:37:14.590
TRAVIS: What the fuck?
MARISHA: I know.

4534
03:37:14.590 --> 03:37:16.868
MATT: Definitely no owl.

4535
03:37:16.868 --> 03:37:19.110
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

4536
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:20.220
MARISHA: Oh, a pigeon.

4537
03:37:22.530 --> 03:37:24.060
Gah.

4538
03:37:24.060 --> 03:37:24.893
TALIESIN: Boo.

4539
03:37:28.720 --> 03:37:31.750
MATT: Where are you going, you heading to Lavish Chateau?

4540
03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:33.008
SAM: Yeah.

4541
03:37:33.008 --> 03:37:34.560
MATT: All right.
SAM: We've got a few hours.

4542
03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:38.048
MATT: You guys make your way towards the Lavish Chateau

4543
03:37:38.048 --> 03:37:41.940
in the familiar landscape of the Opal Archways.

4544
03:37:41.940 --> 03:37:44.290
At this point, the sun is rising.

4545
03:37:44.290 --> 03:37:46.370
You can see to the horizon,

4546
03:37:46.370 --> 03:37:48.440
the colors change in the sky.

4547
03:37:48.440 --> 03:37:50.640
There are some white clouds dappled throughout above,

4548
03:37:50.640 --> 03:37:53.290
but it's nice to see the ocean once more.

4549
03:37:53.290 --> 03:37:57.460
The familiar smell of sea brine and nearby shore

4550
03:37:57.460 --> 03:38:01.210
are very welcoming to you, Fjord, as well as to you, Jester,

4551
03:38:01.210 --> 03:38:03.477
having grown up in this space.

4552
03:38:04.491 --> 03:38:06.110
The Chateau front door is closed at this hour.

4553
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:08.670
They do not usually take people in without,

4554
03:38:08.670 --> 03:38:12.490
but you know the tricks to opening the door without a key.

4555
03:38:12.490 --> 03:38:13.920
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: As you let your way in,

4556
03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:18.920
you can immediately heard Bluud begin to like (stomping)

4557
03:38:19.680 --> 03:38:22.010
down the steps, hearing the front door open.

4558
03:38:22.010 --> 03:38:24.570
Looks like he has a hand crossbow at the ready

4559
03:38:24.570 --> 03:38:27.110
as this large minotaur form pokes down.

4560
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:29.790
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're back.

4561
03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:32.710
MATT: "An unexpected arrival, a bit early."

4562
03:38:33.870 --> 03:38:38.170
LAURA: Or a bit late depending on where you're coming from.

4563
03:38:38.170 --> 03:38:39.920
MATT: "Valid point."
LAURA: Yeah.

4564
03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:41.580
MATT: "Good to see you.

4565
03:38:41.580 --> 03:38:43.260
"Your mother is sleeping."

4566
03:38:43.260 --> 03:38:44.960
LAURA: Yeah, that's okay, can we just

4567
03:38:44.960 --> 03:38:47.870
get into some rooms so we can chill?

4568
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:50.038
MATT: "Yeah, sure, give me a minute,"

4569
03:38:50.038 --> 03:38:51.040
and he walks over and lumbers

4570
03:38:51.040 --> 03:38:54.700
behind the main bar area off to the left side

4571
03:38:54.700 --> 03:38:57.000
of the interior main chamber and goes through

4572
03:38:57.000 --> 03:38:59.330
a couple of keys which are very small in his

4573
03:38:59.330 --> 03:39:02.132
large hands and you can see him just like (grunting).

4574
03:39:02.132 --> 03:39:03.570
LAURA: He's a minotaur.

4575
03:39:03.570 --> 03:39:05.949
MARISHA: Is he paying attention to the bar?
SAM: Not my type.

4576
03:39:05.949 --> 03:39:07.822
MATT: At the very moment, no.

4577
03:39:10.059 --> 03:39:12.675
MARISHA: I'm going to swipe a bottle, take a few swigs,

4578
03:39:12.675 --> 03:39:14.133
put it back.

4579
03:39:14.133 --> 03:39:16.530
MATT: Okay, make a sleight of hand check.

4580
03:39:16.530 --> 03:39:18.120
LAURA: You know you don't have to do that.

4581
03:39:18.120 --> 03:39:19.270
TRAVIS: You're rolling so well tonight.

4582
03:39:19.270 --> 03:39:21.100
MARISHA: I've been rolling so great.

4583
03:39:21.100 --> 03:39:22.834
(laughs)

4584
03:39:22.834 --> 03:39:23.970
(clapping)

4585
03:39:23.970 --> 03:39:25.170
Natural 20.

4586
03:39:26.520 --> 03:39:28.273
On a joke.

4587
03:39:29.960 --> 03:39:33.100
MARISHA: Rapid speed that is impressive to anybody who would

4588
03:39:33.100 --> 03:39:34.883
have mentioned you. Which, at a natural 20 plus--

4589
03:39:34.883 --> 03:39:37.037
what's your--

4590
03:39:37.037 --> 03:39:38.500
MARISHA: 25 total.
MATT: 25.

4591
03:39:38.500 --> 03:39:40.283
None of you notice.

4592
03:39:41.150 --> 03:39:42.740
Not even you, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Cocktails.

4593
03:39:42.740 --> 03:39:44.340
MARISHA: Shit.
LIAM: Just take the bottle.

4594
03:39:44.340 --> 03:39:45.990
MARISHA: Yeah.

4595
03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:48.508
MATT: As Bluud gets up, the bottle like (rattling).

4596
03:39:48.508 --> 03:39:50.712
He goes like

4597
03:39:50.712 --> 03:39:53.170
"Careful.

4598
03:39:53.170 --> 03:39:55.666
"I found your key, let me show you to your room."

4599
03:39:55.666 --> 03:39:57.560
LAURA: Thank you.

4600
03:39:57.560 --> 03:40:00.640
MATT: Leads you guys up the opposite end

4601
03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:02.260
of the top stairway where there's another hallway

4602
03:40:02.260 --> 03:40:04.520
that leads down to where the other chambers are.

4603
03:40:04.520 --> 03:40:06.730
This room you've already stayed in before.

4604
03:40:06.730 --> 03:40:09.250
He apologizes, "There was only one available room.

4605
03:40:09.250 --> 03:40:12.480
"So you'll have to cram up."

4606
03:40:12.480 --> 03:40:14.584
LAURA: We've done it before, it's okay.

4607
03:40:14.584 --> 03:40:16.060
MATT: He gives you the key.
TALIESIN: Not going to be super long.

4608
03:40:16.060 --> 03:40:16.920
MATT: "I'll let your mother know

4609
03:40:16.920 --> 03:40:18.820
"when she wakes up that you've arrived."

4610
03:40:19.910 --> 03:40:22.130
LAURA: Thanks, Bluud.

4611
03:40:22.130 --> 03:40:24.053
Looking good.

4612
03:40:24.053 --> 03:40:24.886
MATT: "Hey."

4613
03:40:26.075 --> 03:40:27.383
Closes the door.

4614
03:40:29.310 --> 03:40:30.360
SAM: All right, so,

4615
03:40:32.260 --> 03:40:33.200
what are we doing?

4616
03:40:33.200 --> 03:40:34.700
TALIESIN: We're arranging some horses.

4617
03:40:36.133 --> 03:40:39.120
We're letting Orly know that we're going to

4618
03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:41.810
be heading out at some point in the near future.

4619
03:40:41.810 --> 03:40:42.643
LAURA: Yeah.

4620
03:40:42.643 --> 03:40:43.780
LIAM: We are literally having a bit of a stop

4621
03:40:43.780 --> 03:40:47.390
for pleasure here so that Jester can see her mother.

4622
03:40:47.390 --> 03:40:48.223
Sure.
LAURA: Yeah.

4623
03:40:49.780 --> 03:40:51.680
MARISHA: Do we feel like we need to talk to Yussa

4624
03:40:51.680 --> 03:40:52.970
or do we want to skip that?

4625
03:40:52.970 --> 03:40:55.580
TALIESIN: I wouldn't say no to talking to
anybody at this point.

4626
03:40:55.580 --> 03:40:58.060
I don't feel like we know enough of anything.

4627
03:40:58.060 --> 03:41:01.620
LAURA: Should I try scrying on someone else?

4628
03:41:01.620 --> 03:41:02.453
SAM: Good gravy.

4629
03:41:03.515 --> 03:41:05.003
LAURA: I could try Yasha.

4630
03:41:07.400 --> 03:41:09.400
TALIESIN: I'd like that.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4631
03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:14.340
SAM: Sure, yeah.
MARISHA: Get some confirmation.

4632
03:41:14.340 --> 03:41:15.350
LAURA: Okay.

4633
03:41:15.350 --> 03:41:18.680
I'm going to just sit down in the middle of the room.

4634
03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:22.500
Everybody get back, I'm working on this important spell.

4635
03:41:23.500 --> 03:41:26.920
I'm going to draw on the ground, I'm going to make some

4636
03:41:26.920 --> 03:41:30.400
arcane rune-ish looking things like Caleb draws.

4637
03:41:32.619 --> 03:41:34.570
TRAVIS: Like a fork.

4638
03:41:34.570 --> 03:41:35.850
MARISHA: Yeah.

4639
03:41:35.850 --> 03:41:37.570
LAURA: It's beautiful, in a weird way from a distance,

4640
03:41:37.570 --> 03:41:39.200
it looks like an actual arcane sigil.

4641
03:41:39.200 --> 03:41:40.410
The closer you get, you can see

4642
03:41:40.410 --> 03:41:42.520
where glyphs and runes would normally be.

4643
03:41:42.520 --> 03:41:46.680
It looks like a continuous series

4644
03:41:46.680 --> 03:41:50.640
of paintings of people folded in nude ways.

4645
03:41:51.530 --> 03:41:54.260
It's almost like the--
LAURA: Kama Sutra.

4646
03:41:54.260 --> 03:41:55.980
MATT: The Mad Magazine, you know.

4647
03:41:55.980 --> 03:41:58.279
TRAVIS: Yeah, the fold-in.
MATT: Long miniature

4648
03:41:58.279 --> 03:41:59.379
margin comics.

4649
03:42:01.325 --> 03:42:03.320
It's kind of interesting.

4650
03:42:03.320 --> 03:42:04.970
So you're starting to scry on Yasha.

4651
03:42:08.170 --> 03:42:09.360
What's your spell DC?

4652
03:42:09.360 --> 03:42:11.060
LAURA: 17.
MATT: 17, okay.

4653
03:42:13.280 --> 03:42:16.420
As you sit and focus, you feel

4654
03:42:16.420 --> 03:42:18.670
the wind blow in from your window.

4655
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:20.380
The smell of the sea air calms you

4656
03:42:22.476 --> 03:42:25.790
and the Traveler once more leans in

4657
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:27.680
across the other shoulder this time and goes,

4658
03:42:29.610 --> 03:42:31.698
"I think we've found someone this time."

4659
03:42:31.698 --> 03:42:33.190
LAURA: Finally.

4660
03:42:33.190 --> 03:42:34.110
MATT: As you close your eyes,

4661
03:42:34.110 --> 03:42:38.258
you feel your vision pulled forward

4662
03:42:40.022 --> 03:42:41.850
through clouds and sky.

4663
03:42:41.850 --> 03:42:43.600
(whooshing)

4664
03:42:43.600 --> 03:42:48.160
To a flash of a metropolitan area.

4665
03:42:48.160 --> 03:42:50.810
Just an instance, you see buildings, you see streets.

4666
03:42:51.650 --> 03:42:52.750
There's another flash.

4667
03:42:54.840 --> 03:42:58.410
LAURA: Did I recognize the city, did it look familiar?

4668
03:42:58.410 --> 03:43:01.890
MATT: Make a perception check.

4669
03:43:02.920 --> 03:43:05.830
LAURA: Oh, nah, it didn't do it.

4670
03:43:05.830 --> 03:43:06.663
19.

4671
03:43:07.500 --> 03:43:08.800
MATT: 19.

4672
03:43:08.800 --> 03:43:11.660
In the quick glance that you see there,

4673
03:43:11.660 --> 03:43:13.350
the perimeter of it, at the periphery,

4674
03:43:13.350 --> 03:43:16.010
though it is just a quick flash,

4675
03:43:16.010 --> 03:43:18.768
there's something triangular to its shape.

4676
03:43:21.690 --> 03:43:22.523
LAURA: Okay.

4677
03:43:25.400 --> 03:43:26.591
MATT: Now,

4678
03:43:28.880 --> 03:43:31.480
you're pulled through into a low lit hall

4679
03:43:31.480 --> 03:43:33.582
of light marble pillars.

4680
03:43:34.820 --> 03:43:37.857
Rows and rows of books and scrolls.

4681
03:43:39.090 --> 03:43:40.603
Splashes of blood.

4682
03:43:42.140 --> 03:43:44.690
Cold bodies swathed

4683
03:43:44.690 --> 03:43:46.900
in gray and blue

4684
03:43:46.900 --> 03:43:49.508
sprawled across the stone floor.

4685
03:43:52.130 --> 03:43:54.010
Yasha walks.

4686
03:43:54.010 --> 03:43:58.550
Step, step, the Magician's Judge at her side,

4687
03:43:58.550 --> 03:44:02.435
crimson spray across the front of her face and shoulders.

4688
03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:07.196
Make another perception check.

4689
03:44:07.196 --> 03:44:08.920
LAURA: Fuck.

4690
03:44:10.480 --> 03:44:14.550
I am going to just hold my hands really tight for Guidance.

4691
03:44:15.460 --> 03:44:17.210
Can I do that, am I allowed to do that?

4692
03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:18.170
MATT: Not in the middle of it.

4693
03:44:18.170 --> 03:44:19.610
LAURA: Okay, I know.

4694
03:44:19.610 --> 03:44:21.668
Nine.
MATT: Nine, okay.

4695
03:44:23.060 --> 03:44:28.000
You follow her stepping forward down the staircase.

4696
03:44:29.790 --> 03:44:34.450
A person rushes by and her arms (swooshing)

4697
03:44:35.600 --> 03:44:37.400
and the person crumbles out of view.

4698
03:44:38.980 --> 03:44:40.770
Walking up to

4699
03:44:40.770 --> 03:44:43.902
a door that is broken,

4700
03:44:46.610 --> 03:44:50.460
Yasha stops and there at the cusp

4701
03:44:50.460 --> 03:44:54.640
of the blurred vision of the sensor of the scry,

4702
03:44:54.640 --> 03:44:58.800
you see a man of dark hair, smooth complexion wearing

4703
03:44:58.800 --> 03:45:02.992
the similar gray-blue robes as the other figures around.

4704
03:45:04.190 --> 03:45:06.460
A familiar voice comes through that says,

4705
03:45:06.460 --> 03:45:08.840
as he's looking through a book

4706
03:45:08.840 --> 03:45:11.373
amongst a pile of books on the ground,

4707
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:15.300
"Vence fails to pull his weight.

4708
03:45:15.300 --> 03:45:18.622
"The Angel will see my deeds superior."

4709
03:45:20.220 --> 03:45:23.000
You recognize the voice as Obann's.

4710
03:45:26.850 --> 03:45:27.970
Pulling back a bit,

4711
03:45:27.970 --> 03:45:32.720
you can see Yasha's wings are unfurled, black, dark.

4712
03:45:32.720 --> 03:45:36.262
Strands of tethered shadow holding them.

4713
03:45:37.630 --> 03:45:40.760
You hear a distant scream that is silenced

4714
03:45:40.760 --> 03:45:44.060
followed by a faint discordant echo of laughter.

4715
03:45:44.060 --> 03:45:49.060
Many voices laughing together, blending and bending.

4716
03:45:49.240 --> 03:45:52.350
The reading human's eyes go wide as he smiles.

4717
03:45:55.860 --> 03:45:59.000
"Jourrael's remains were bisected.

4718
03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:01.508
"The heart buried within the Lotusden

4719
03:46:02.660 --> 03:46:07.660
"and the skull entrusted to the elves within the Veluthil.

4720
03:46:08.030 --> 03:46:10.186
"(chuckles)

4721
03:46:10.186 --> 03:46:11.370
"It seems we have some questions

4722
03:46:11.370 --> 03:46:13.618
"to ask, my dear Orphan Maker.

4723
03:46:14.890 --> 03:46:17.360
"Come, Hand."

4724
03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:20.047
You feel the presence and the footsteps

4725
03:46:20.047 --> 03:46:23.170
(stomping)

4726
03:46:23.170 --> 03:46:26.540
of the Laughing Hand pushing behind Yasha.

4727
03:46:26.540 --> 03:46:28.748
The slight, light chuckles.

4728
03:46:28.748 --> 03:46:31.498
(raspy cackling)

4729
03:46:33.690 --> 03:46:35.875
"Let us find you a new friend."

4730
03:46:37.370 --> 03:46:41.090
Obann reaches out and grabs the blade of the Hand

4731
03:46:41.090 --> 03:46:43.940
and extents the other hand towards Yasha.

4732
03:46:43.940 --> 03:46:47.370
Yasha, you can see the blood streaks across her face

4733
03:46:47.370 --> 03:46:50.410
pierced by the tears

4734
03:46:50.410 --> 03:46:52.435
that run down,

4735
03:46:54.210 --> 03:46:56.552
reach out and grab his other hand.

4736
03:46:59.210 --> 03:47:03.165
All three vanish and the scrying connection is lost.

4737
03:47:07.270 --> 03:47:09.721
LAURA: I tell them everything.

4738
03:47:09.721 --> 03:47:10.840
MARISHA: That was the demon.

4739
03:47:10.840 --> 03:47:13.910
SAM: What was all that?

4740
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:16.410
LIAM: Jourrael's heart bisected?

4741
03:47:16.410 --> 03:47:18.510
MATT: Jourrael's remained were bisected.

4742
03:47:20.040 --> 03:47:22.000
The heart buried within the Lotusden.

4743
03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:23.550
LIAM: Heart buried, Lotusden.

4744
03:47:23.550 --> 03:47:26.500
MATT: The skull entrusted to the elves within the Veluthil.

4745
03:47:27.370 --> 03:47:28.203
MARISHA: Vel-

4746
03:47:29.520 --> 03:47:30.990
thil.
MATT: Veluthil.

4747
03:47:30.990 --> 03:47:32.448
MARISHA: Veluthil.

4748
03:47:36.009 --> 03:47:37.621
Remains

4749
03:47:37.621 --> 03:47:40.640
were bisected.

4750
03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:41.610
And

4751
03:47:41.610 --> 03:47:43.330
you said library--

4752
03:47:43.330 --> 03:47:46.050
LAURA: Was that the Cobalt Reserve?

4753
03:47:46.050 --> 03:47:48.090
MARISHA: Is it the Cobalt Reserve?

4754
03:47:48.090 --> 03:47:50.680
MATT: The Cobalt Reserve technically is in Tal'Dorei.

4755
03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:54.080
MARISHA: The Cobalt Soul in Zadash and--

4756
03:47:54.080 --> 03:47:58.536
MATT: Have you visited the Archive in Zadash?

4757
03:47:58.536 --> 03:48:00.690
LAURA: No, but I've seen the outside of it.

4758
03:48:00.690 --> 03:48:02.054
MARISHA: What about the--

4759
03:48:02.054 --> 03:48:03.360
MATT: You didn't get a full view of the city.

4760
03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:04.193
You're not sure

4761
03:48:05.182 --> 03:48:07.360
what the interior was.
LAURA: But I recognized a triangle.

4762
03:48:07.360 --> 03:48:09.280
MATT: Yes, you recognized the triangle shape of a city.

4763
03:48:09.280 --> 03:48:11.450
LAURA: In the city or the city--
SAM: Triangle, the city was shaped--

4764
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:13.000
MATT: The city had a triangular

4765
03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:15.570
shape to its outside, like wall perimeter.

4766
03:48:15.570 --> 03:48:16.470
MARISHA: Was that Zadash?

4767
03:48:17.470 --> 03:48:19.090
MATT: Zadash is pretty triangular.

4768
03:48:19.090 --> 03:48:20.190
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4769
03:48:21.190 --> 03:48:23.410
They're in Zadash right now.

4770
03:48:23.410 --> 03:48:24.660
MARISHA: That sounds a lot like the Cobalt.

4771
03:48:24.660 --> 03:48:26.550
LAURA: They were in Zadash, they just left.

4772
03:48:26.550 --> 03:48:28.442
They killed so many people.

4773
03:48:30.560 --> 03:48:32.640
SAM: What were they looking for?

4774
03:48:32.640 --> 03:48:35.590
MARISHA: If they were at the Soul, they were looking for

4775
03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:40.533
information, we have restricted books that hide secrets and

4776
03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:47.247
information that should be kept from people just like Obann.

4777
03:48:48.240 --> 03:48:49.073
LAURA: He got it.

4778
03:48:50.500 --> 03:48:51.830
SAM: Who's Jourrael?

4779
03:48:53.681 --> 03:48:55.870
MARISHA: Have we heard, it feels like we've heard of that.

4780
03:48:55.870 --> 03:48:56.703
LIAM: History-wise?

4781
03:48:56.703 --> 03:48:58.670
MATT: Make a history check, both of,

4782
03:48:58.670 --> 03:49:01.560
anybody who's trained in history,

4783
03:49:01.560 --> 03:49:03.920
is proficient in history, go ahead and roll.

4784
03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:05.180
MARISHA: Yeah, it does.

4785
03:49:05.180 --> 03:49:06.623
LIAM: 17.

4786
03:49:06.623 --> 03:49:07.870
TRAVIS: Angel.

4787
03:49:07.870 --> 03:49:10.670
TALIESIN: I'm going to bless, I'm going to use a--

4788
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:11.720
MARISHA: 20.

4789
03:49:11.720 --> 03:49:13.640
TALIESIN: You can add a d4 because, if I--

4790
03:49:13.640 --> 03:49:14.473
MARISHA: Plus?

4791
03:49:14.473 --> 03:49:15.730
TALIESIN: I was going to use a Guidance.

4792
03:49:17.230 --> 03:49:19.873
MATT: Oh, a guidance to--
TALIESIN: Yeah, if you're doing--

4793
03:49:19.873 --> 03:49:21.413
Can I do it after the roll or no?

4794
03:49:21.413 --> 03:49:22.579
MATT: I'll allow it.
TALIESIN: Okay.

4795
03:49:22.579 --> 03:49:24.400
MATT: But normally you have to do that before the roll.

4796
03:49:24.400 --> 03:49:25.560
MARISHA: 21.
MATT: Okay.

4797
03:49:27.380 --> 03:49:28.530
It doesn't ring a bell.

4798
03:49:32.610 --> 03:49:34.780
This is something beyond the knowledge that you've learned.

4799
03:49:34.780 --> 03:49:39.640
This would be something you'd need to research deeper.

4800
03:49:39.640 --> 03:49:40.610
LIAM: And Veluthil.

4801
03:49:40.610 --> 03:49:41.443
MATT: Veluthil.

4802
03:49:41.443 --> 03:49:42.440
LIAM: Same for history?

4803
03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:45.841
MARISHA: Is it on any of our maps?
LIAM: Elves in--

4804
03:49:45.841 --> 03:49:47.020
MATT: I'd say make another

4805
03:49:47.020 --> 03:49:48.745
history check for that particular one.

4806
03:49:48.745 --> 03:49:51.210
MARISHA: Can I do that too?
MATT: Sure, both of you guys.

4807
03:49:51.210 --> 03:49:53.059
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4808
03:49:53.059 --> 03:49:55.120
I'm going to give you a pat on the back.

4809
03:49:55.120 --> 03:49:56.760
TRAVIS: I think that's an old name for some place.

4810
03:49:56.760 --> 03:49:58.637
MARISHA: It's not good for me.

4811
03:49:58.637 --> 03:49:59.590
LIAM: 16 plus--

4812
03:49:59.590 --> 03:50:00.810
TRAVIS: Places change names.

4813
03:50:00.810 --> 03:50:01.750
MATT: Well, no.
LIAM: Are you both helping me?

4814
03:50:01.750 --> 03:50:03.960
LAURA: No, no. Only one at a time, he was helping.

4815
03:50:03.960 --> 03:50:06.130
LIAM: 17 again.
MATT: 17.

4816
03:50:06.130 --> 03:50:06.963
MARISHA: 15.

4817
03:50:06.963 --> 03:50:09.430
MATT: Once again, it doesn't quite ring a bell.

4818
03:50:09.430 --> 03:50:11.890
TALIESIN: Would a religion check make sense in any of this?

4819
03:50:13.296 --> 03:50:14.129
MATT: No.

4820
03:50:14.129 --> 03:50:17.290
Well, I'll allow a religion check for you.

4821
03:50:17.290 --> 03:50:18.410
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4822
03:50:18.410 --> 03:50:19.980
MATT: For

4823
03:50:19.980 --> 03:50:21.380
Jourrael.

4824
03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:24.673
TALIESIN: Eight.

4825
03:50:26.300 --> 03:50:28.260
LIAM: Shit.
MATT: Unfortunately,

4826
03:50:28.260 --> 03:50:31.450
your experience learning and teaching

4827
03:50:33.720 --> 03:50:35.950
did not contain any of the information

4828
03:50:35.950 --> 03:50:38.780
that you seek in these brief statements

4829
03:50:38.780 --> 03:50:41.615
that Jester managed to pull from the scry.

4830
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:43.740
TALIESIN: Now we have a good excuse

4831
03:50:43.740 --> 03:50:45.440
to take a meeting before we leave.

4832
03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:48.075
LAURA: Yasha was crying.

4833
03:50:51.870 --> 03:50:54.490
LIAM: And you're tapped, can you scry again?

4834
03:50:56.990 --> 03:51:00.570
MARISHA: You said there was blood all over the place.

4835
03:51:00.570 --> 03:51:03.353
LAURA: There were dead bodies all over the place.

4836
03:51:12.370 --> 03:51:15.700
LIAM: Well, we do not know where she has gone.

4837
03:51:15.700 --> 03:51:18.850
There is nothing we can do about it right now.

4838
03:51:18.850 --> 03:51:21.260
We continue as planned.

4839
03:51:21.260 --> 03:51:25.240
See your mother, arrange travel, head into the Empire.

4840
03:51:25.240 --> 03:51:26.750
LAURA: Quickly.

4841
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:27.690
MARISHA: Quickly.

4842
03:51:27.690 --> 03:51:28.800
TALIESIN: Horses, no carts.

4843
03:51:30.050 --> 03:51:30.883
LAURA: Yeah.

4844
03:51:33.370 --> 03:51:35.000
MATT: And that

4845
03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:37.830
is where we'll pick up for our next session.

4846
03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:39.830
SAM: So frustrating.

4847
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:41.010
LIAM: Super frustrating episode.

4848
03:51:41.010 --> 03:51:42.130
MATT: Sorry.

4849
03:51:42.130 --> 03:51:44.897
TALIESIN: You got used to teleporting.

4850
03:51:44.897 --> 03:51:46.480
LIAM: We had a really like defined goal

4851
03:51:46.480 --> 03:51:49.360
for multiple chapters here and now

4852
03:51:49.360 --> 03:51:51.430
we're just figuring out where to go next.

4853
03:51:51.430 --> 03:51:52.290
TALIESIN: And then two weeks gone.

4854
03:51:52.290 --> 03:51:54.500
MATT: There's a lot of things happening at once.

4855
03:51:54.500 --> 03:51:55.954
LAURA: Within the world, yeah.

4856
03:51:55.954 --> 03:51:57.070
LIAM: Let's run away from

4857
03:51:57.070 --> 03:51:59.090
it all and do Traveler Con.
TALIESIN: There's an island.

4858
03:51:59.090 --> 03:52:00.810
Traveler Con.
LIAM: Just Traveler Con.

4859
03:52:00.810 --> 03:52:02.730
MATT: Traveler Con will be there in seven weeks.

4860
03:52:02.730 --> 03:52:05.720
You got time to handle some other things in the interim.

4861
03:52:05.720 --> 03:52:09.680
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to find my menagerie soon.

4862
03:52:09.680 --> 03:52:11.628
I can wait, but--

4863
03:52:11.628 --> 03:52:13.260
MATT: It's something you have to research as well.

4864
03:52:13.260 --> 03:52:15.780
LIAM: The menagerie in Traveler Con.

4865
03:52:15.780 --> 03:52:16.730
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: A fucking rave.

4866
03:52:16.730 --> 03:52:17.710
MATT: Just fold it all.

4867
03:52:17.710 --> 03:52:20.822
TALIESIN: It'll be like the prisoner hotel.

4868
03:52:22.780 --> 03:52:24.656
Be seeing you.
TRAVIS: Yasha, too.

4869
03:52:24.656 --> 03:52:26.120
LAURA: There's so many fucking things.

4870
03:52:26.120 --> 03:52:27.030
MARISHA: Yeah, it really sucks.

4871
03:52:27.030 --> 03:52:28.860
You have to have authority figures

4872
03:52:28.860 --> 03:52:31.880
to rebel against or else who am I?

4873
03:52:31.880 --> 03:52:34.988
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's like having
hippie parents; it's so hard.

4874
03:52:34.988 --> 03:52:37.470
TRAVIS: And you just got a promotion.

4875
03:52:37.470 --> 03:52:39.090
LAURA: You're rebelling against yourself now.

4876
03:52:39.090 --> 03:52:41.150
LIAM: That's right.

4877
03:52:41.150 --> 03:52:43.180
TALIESIN: You're The Man now.
MARISHA: That's not what I meant

4878
03:52:43.180 --> 03:52:46.140
when I said, "I hate you, mom," that's not what I meant.

4879
03:52:46.140 --> 03:52:48.060
TALIESIN: I am become mom, destroyer of worlds.

4880
03:52:48.060 --> 03:52:49.540
LAURA: I am become mom.

4881
03:52:49.540 --> 03:52:50.890
LIAM: Just rounding the corner.

4882
03:52:53.720 --> 03:52:55.661
TALIESIN: That was both frustrating and amazing

4883
03:52:55.661 --> 03:52:56.494
at the same time.

4884
03:52:56.494 --> 03:52:59.028
I'm so excited.
LAURA: Yeah.

4885
03:52:59.028 --> 03:53:01.920
LIAM: Well, the fly is dead, long live the fly.

4886
03:53:01.920 --> 03:53:04.178
MATT: The fly is dead, long live the fly.

4887
03:53:04.178 --> 03:53:05.750
TALIESIN: The brain is back.

4888
03:53:05.750 --> 03:53:06.800
TRAVIS: Two kills.

4889
03:53:06.800 --> 03:53:08.070
MARISHA: Two kills.
LIAM: Pop.

4890
03:53:08.070 --> 03:53:08.903
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4891
03:53:08.903 --> 03:53:10.840
TRAVIS: He died because we were having so much fun.

4892
03:53:10.840 --> 03:53:12.105
MATT: There will unfortunately not be a game next week

4893
03:53:12.105 --> 03:53:13.096
because I'll be flying to Sweden.

4894
03:53:13.096 --> 03:53:15.970
LAURA: Oh, shit.
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

4895
03:53:15.970 --> 03:53:17.490
MATT: That'll give you guys two weeks to figure out

4896
03:53:17.490 --> 03:53:19.600
what you want to do and where you want to go--

4897
03:53:19.600 --> 03:53:22.220
TALIESIN: Are we going to do a crazy text thread
like we used to?

4898
03:53:22.220 --> 03:53:23.340
LAURA: Yes.
TALIESIN: We should do a crazy,

4899
03:53:23.340 --> 03:53:25.088
crazy, no-Matt text thread.

4900
03:53:25.088 --> 03:53:26.496
MATT: That's exactly what you should do.

4901
03:53:26.496 --> 03:53:28.026
MARISHA: (chanting) Level 10.

4902
03:53:28.026 --> 03:53:30.330
ALL: (chanting) Level 10.

4903
03:53:31.320 --> 03:53:33.700
TALIESIN: Yeah, no one's even seen you
use your crazy sword yet.

4904
03:53:35.160 --> 03:53:36.170
LAURA: Soon.

4905
03:53:36.170 --> 03:53:38.503
TALIESIN: Thing has a card so long

4906
03:53:38.503 --> 03:53:40.761
that it's practically a soliloquy.

4907
03:53:40.761 --> 03:53:42.993
LIAM: Should we do something dumb next week?

4908
03:53:42.993 --> 03:53:45.920
LAURA: No.
LIAM: No?

4909
03:53:45.920 --> 03:53:48.852
TALIESIN: Define dumb.
SAM: What do you mean?

4910
03:53:48.852 --> 03:53:50.221
LIAM: Traveler Con.

4911
03:53:50.221 --> 03:53:52.700
(laughter)

4912
03:53:52.700 --> 03:53:54.490
MATT: Perfect.
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

4913
03:53:54.490 --> 03:53:56.300
MATT: All right, well thank you guys so much.

4914
03:53:56.300 --> 03:53:57.940
We missed you and we'll miss you next week.

4915
03:53:57.940 --> 03:53:59.590
We'll be back then and probably

4916
03:53:59.590 --> 03:54:02.430
consistently for a while after that.

4917
03:54:02.430 --> 03:54:05.310
In the interim, we love you very much and--

4918
03:54:05.310 --> 03:54:07.430
LAURA: So much.
MATT: Is it Thursday yet?

4919
03:54:07.430 --> 03:54:08.263
Good night, guys.

4920
03:54:08.263 --> 03:54:10.106
LIAM and MARISHA: No.

4921
03:54:10.106 --> 03:54:13.439
(dramatic music)

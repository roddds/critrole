00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:05.634
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:07.481
(cheering)

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:11.343
MATT: Before we get into tonight's story, welcome.
We have some quick announcements to do. First off,

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:15.934
we have two fantastic sponsors for the evening.
Returning for the second week for the newly

00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:17.694
released game, Far Cry 5.

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:19.112
(cheering)

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:19.749
TRAVIS: So good.

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:25.424
MATT: It's out for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The
latest installment of Far Cry, if you guys aren't

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:30.570
familiar with it, is set in the fictional Hope
County, Montana, where a fanatical doomsday cult

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.555
known as the Project at Eden's Gate has taken
control. If you are playing it or plan to play it,

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:41.112
you'll probably hear me and Marisha somewhere in
that cult, I'm sure, or scattered in the game at

00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:41.754
some point.

00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:42.658
TRAVIS: You're cultists?

00:00:42.658 --> 00:00:45.018
LAURA: I've always known that about you.

00:00:45.018 --> 00:00:46.467
MARISHA: It's my true destiny, yeah.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:52.606
MATT: I got to work on my Montana for that one. It
was fun. It strangely is. Sorry, Montana. Grab

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:57.154
your sidekick, train your dog, and fight against
Eden's Gate in the most Far Cry way possible,

00:00:57.154 --> 00:01:01.348
which is with extreme force, so pick up a copy
today. Hope you enjoy.

00:01:01.348 --> 00:01:04.513
TRAVIS: The prologue is so good it is currently
encompassing Brian Wayne Foster's life.

00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:07.837
MATT: This game is a lot of people's lives. I've
watched people vanish over the past couple days.

00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:10.848
LIAM: Raving about it. It's only been out for five
seconds, and everyone's gaga.

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:16.079
MATT: Yeah. Jess Black in the game is voiced by
our friend of the show Julie Nathanson. She is

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.460
amazing and you should enjoy her work in there as
well. That's our first sponsor for the night. Our

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.376
second sponsor and our continuous sponsor for this
new campaign, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:27.210
(cheering)

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.279
SAM: Here to talk to you about D&amp;D Beyond is a
returning friend of the show.

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:31.527
(laughter)

00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:33.648
MATT: No! No, why?

00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:41.809
SAM: Bonzai, wave hogs and hog-ettes, it's Brody
Slater, king of the kick-flip, jamming about the

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:48.020
froobs at D&amp;D Beyond. You all know I love letting
my leash out on maxed shore breaks at Steamer

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.456
Lane. Real bang! When I'm not flashing the shaka
at some quimby on a softboard, I'm chillaxing with

00:01:55.456 --> 00:02:03.035
my buds with some gnarly roleplaying games. Now,
I'm partial to Dead Earth, Empire of Satanis, and

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:11.435
F.A.T.A.L.-- slotted!-- but my broheims are hooked
on fifth edition, which means I get stoked for D&amp;D

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:17.313
Beyond. If there's one thing Brody Slater loves
more than shacked eskimo rolls, it's diligent

00:02:17.313 --> 00:02:23.369
organization. Right now, you can go to D&amp;D
Beyond's Facebook page and leave a comment on

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:30.167
their top (stammers) pinned post, telling them
your favorite moment for episode 11 of Critical

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:38.825
Role to be entered to win a legendary bundle. Far
out! So don't be a Benny Poser, head on over to

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:42.847
D&amp;D Beyond and enter now. Hang 11!

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:45.336
(cheering and clapping)

00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:47.574
LAURA: Wait, leave it on, because you kind of look
like Estelle Getty.

00:02:47.574 --> 00:02:50.593
(laughter)

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:54.973
MATT: If Shakäste comes back later on, you can
play his spiritual weapon.

00:02:54.973 --> 00:02:57.758
LIAM: That made me uncomfortable so fast.

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:01.870
MATT: The character didn't click until he said he
played F.A.T.A.L., and then I was, oh, I know who

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.821
this is now.

00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:04.729
SAM: I don't even know what that is, I looked it
up.

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.233
MATT: Don't. It's awful. It's the worst.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:08.685
TRAVIS: Is that the third time we've had him? In
our lifetime?

00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:11.671
SAM: Fan favorite. And by fan, I mean me.

00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:13.910
(laughter)

00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:15.066
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:16.410
SAM: I'm a fan of my own character.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.075
TRAVIS: Like Halley's Comet, you always come
around.

00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:26.011
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you to D&amp;D Beyond
for being awesome supporters of the show. A couple

00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:30.118
quick things after that. First off, reminding you
guys about Twitch Prime. If you have an Amazon

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:33.417
Prime account, you can connect it to your Twitch
account, and every month you can subscribe for

00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:36.986
free to a channel of your choice. Whether that'd
be us or anybody else you'd want to show some love

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:42.987
to, costs you nothing and it's pretty awesome, so
do it if you haven't. If you need a recap for

00:03:42.987 --> 00:03:47.705
campaign two, we're doing our Critical Recap
episodes now with our fantastic Dani Carr, who is

00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:51.814
doing succinct updates and reminders for things
that have happened in the campaign, or if you've

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:55.062
missed something and don't have the time and want
to watch live, you can watch Critical Recap and be

00:03:55.062 --> 00:03:57.227
right ready to go when you’re here on Thursday.

00:03:57.227 --> 00:03:58.215
LAURA: Right ready to go.

00:03:58.215 --> 00:03:58.649
TALIESIN: Right ready.

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:04.579
MATT: Talks Machina, of course, is every Tuesday
evening. We just had our WonderCon panel that we

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.662
did this past Sunday on Tuesday night for Talks,
and it's online. You can go watch it on Youtube

00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:15.930
now. Again, Geek and Sundry Youtube, should be up
there to watch it. But the episode of Talks for

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.230
tonight's episode will be next Tuesday at 7pm
Pacific with our fantastic host Brian W. Foster.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.914
Please come join those of us who will be here, and
enjoy.

00:04:23.914 --> 00:04:28.804
LAURA: My mom called me today, and she's like,
“I'm watching you in the WonderCon panel.” I was

00:04:28.804 --> 00:04:30.909
like, oh no. What did I say?

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.960
(laughter)

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.139
TRAVIS: I think your language was actually pretty
good.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:34.804
LAURA: Was it?

00:04:34.804 --> 00:04:35.334
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:41.508
MATT: We kind of had to. Yeah, on the back of the
name cards, it says, “Please don't ever say bad words."

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.814
TRAVIS: We still dropped a few.

00:04:43.814 --> 00:04:45.587
MATT: Yeah. I mean, we're only human.

00:04:46.527 --> 00:04:47.606
MARISHA: We do our best.

00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:50.878
MATT: True. Most of us. Except for Taliesin.

00:04:50.878 --> 00:04:51.407
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:04:51.407 --> 00:04:57.331
MATT: The podcast of last week's episode, episode
11, is available for download, so if you listen to

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:00.621
the show audibly or have friends who do, they can
download it now, where finest podcasts can be

00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:07.921
downloaded. C2E2 is coming up! Not this weekend,
but the weekend after, in Chicago. We're all going

00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:11.737
to be there. We have panels, signings, all of the
information is up on the website now. You can find

00:05:11.737 --> 00:05:15.090
it on the Geek and Sundry Twitter or the Critical
Role Twitter if you're wondering what is happening

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.816
and where to go. We'd love to see you. Please come
and be a part of the crazy convention. It's

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:21.806
probably going to be pretty crazy.

00:05:21.806 --> 00:05:22.421
SAM: Is it?

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.786
MATT: It's pretty big and there’s a lot of people
going.

00:05:23.786 --> 00:05:28.535
TRAVIS: Chicago is a tiny town, though. There's
not really a lot that's there. It's a couple

00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:31.783
trains or little puddle-jumper flights to get
there.

00:05:31.783 --> 00:05:34.097
LIAM: Are you pre-rolling your goddamn dice now?

00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:36.151
TRAVIS: It was one roll!

00:05:39.771 --> 00:05:41.737
LAURA: It's true love, baby.

00:05:41.737 --> 00:05:45.299
MARISHA: There was definitely more than one. It
was at least two or three.

00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:47.458
MATT: We're watching you like a hawk now, man.

00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:48.358
TRAVIS: Never again.

00:05:48.358 --> 00:05:58.851
MATT: Also, our fantastic friends at 826 and
826LA; they're a great charity. They do wonderful

00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:04.425
stuff for children in creative writing. Please go
ahead and check out what they do, see if you can

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:09.223
help support it or actually be a volunteer if a
chapter is near you, so check it out. We love them

00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:15.127
and you should do so too. I don't think we have
any new merch per se other than just the reminder,

00:06:15.127 --> 00:06:15.950
you have that wonderful shirt.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.033
LAURA: Oh, this shirt?!

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:18.999
MATT: It looks good on you even when you're
preggers.

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.683
LAURA: Thank you.

00:06:19.683 --> 00:06:20.831
SAM: Even better.

00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:24.275
LAURA: This is our first maternity shirt.

00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:34.115
MATT: Officially. Unless we have anything else to
say, I believe that gets us caught up and ready to

00:06:34.115 --> 00:06:37.898
dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:43.800
[click, TV static]

00:06:43.800 --> 00:08:01.088
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:15.148
MATT: Hello and welcome back. Last we left off,
the Mighty Nein had gotten in bed with a rebel

00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:21.914
group who had been meeting in the interior of
Zadash. Unhappy with some members of the local

00:08:21.914 --> 00:08:26.246
government of this city, they had been trying to
discover a way they could discredit some of the

00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:31.703
corrupt individuals that have been causing some
strife in this city to some of the locals. You had

00:08:31.703 --> 00:08:39.507
met some of these individuals a few times to
discover that there is an End of Harvest Gala that

00:08:39.507 --> 00:08:47.496
was arriving fairly soon. That was going to be a
distraction period to allow them to infiltrate the

00:08:47.496 --> 00:08:57.790
abodes of two individuals in particular: Lord
Sutan and the High-Richter Prucine. You discussed

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:02.745
with them last time a plot, fixing their
not-very-well-put-together plot into a better

00:09:02.745 --> 00:09:04.955
direction, thankfully.

00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:08.505
TRAVIS: We're all fucked.

00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:18.358
MATT: --to acquire a wax seal within the home of
Lord Sutan to create a letter that you feel would

00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:25.809
be incriminating, then to infiltrate the
High-Richter's home, do the same, and then report

00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:33.810
them to the lawmaster, or whoever else you'd think
would be of higher estate. This is transpiring

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.889
tomorrow evening. Where we last left off, it was
later in the afternoon after your final

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:41.419
discussion. You guys have a day to prepare however
you wish to.

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:42.627
SAM: A whole day?

00:09:43.007 --> 00:09:46.076
LAURA: Well, half a day, and then a whole other
day.

00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:51.204
MATT: Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:52.204
TRAVIS: What's the lawmaster's name?

00:09:52.204 --> 00:09:53.546
MATT: Orentha.

00:09:53.546 --> 00:09:54.700
MARISHA: Dayana Prucine

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.465
MATT: That's the High-Richter.

00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:57.967
MARISHA: Oh, Orentha.

00:09:57.967 --> 00:10:00.027
LAURA: Where are we right now?

00:10:00.027 --> 00:10:04.970
MATT: Right now, you guys have just finished
meeting with the other members of the Knights of

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:05.627
Requital in--

00:10:07.237 --> 00:10:08.635
TRAVIS: At the Song and Supper Inn

00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:09.431
MATT: Song and Supper, yes.

00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:11.374
TALIESIN: Previously known as the Knights of
Requital.

00:10:11.374 --> 00:10:12.684
EVERYBODY: Right, yes.

00:10:12.684 --> 00:10:13.244
MATT: No longer.

00:10:20.444 --> 00:10:26.638
TRAVIS: We’ve got to figure out where fucking Lord
Sutan is, right? We don't have any eyes on that location.

00:10:26.638 --> 00:10:32.069
MARISHA: I think it might also be smart to see if
we can drum up any type of handwriting samples for

00:10:32.087 --> 00:10:40.455
possibly both the Lord Sutan and the High-Richter,
so we can more convincingly forge documents.

00:10:40.455 --> 00:10:43.636
TALIESIN: We have Book Boy, too, he could probably
tell if they're the same or not with his--

00:10:44.706 --> 00:10:45.584
MARISHA: With his brain.

00:10:45.584 --> 00:10:46.729
TALIESIN: With his brain.

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:47.577
MARISHA: With his head.

00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:49.875
TALIESIN: Yes. Well, the eyes in it, yes.

00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:52.211
LAURA: Wait, what did you say? I wasn't
listening.

00:10:52.211 --> 00:10:52.815
SAM: (groans)

00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:56.018
LAURA: There was a spiderweb in the corner of the
room and it's really pretty.

00:10:57.188 --> 00:10:58.548
MARISHA: You're good at forging, right?

00:10:58.548 --> 00:11:00.222
LAURA: Yes, I am! Why do you ask?

00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:05.133
MARISHA: We have to get some handwriting samples,
right? Of the Lord and the High-Richter, that way

00:11:05.133 --> 00:11:07.104
we can write letters, make it seem like they're--

00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:09.034
LAURA: Yes, I’m very good at writing letters.

00:11:10.714 --> 00:11:13.024
TRAVIS: Where would we find something that's
handwritten?

00:11:14.444 --> 00:11:17.092
SAM: Maybe on the job board at that place.

00:11:17.092 --> 00:11:18.426
TRAVIS: Would that come from them, you think?

00:11:18.426 --> 00:11:19.035
SAM: I don't know!

00:11:20.145 --> 00:11:24.061
LIAM: They might have some sort of edict written
by Prucine.

00:11:24.061 --> 00:11:27.463
TRAVIS: Yeah, we didn't really check to see if
they had signed any of them, did they?

00:11:27.463 --> 00:11:32.148
TALIESIN: We had them, would we have noticed if
they were hand-signed or if they’d been printed?

00:11:34.508 --> 00:11:38.931
MATT: At the job postings you had seen on the task
board outside of the King's Hall, they were

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:43.664
handwritten, but they all had been written by the
Herald of the Hall. He was the one who was

00:11:43.664 --> 00:11:47.343
handling most of the jobs that were being
distributed. Whatever information comes to him,

00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:49.232
he's the one who posts them, it seems.

00:11:49.232 --> 00:11:54.408
LAURA: Well, I guess we we’ll just have to find a
letter within their house, and then I can forge it

00:11:54.408 --> 00:11:55.298
right away.

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:58.572
SAM: On the spot? How fast a forger are you?

00:11:58.572 --> 00:12:01.519
LAURA: I'm a really quick thinker and I'm also a
pretty fast writer.

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:16.506
SAM: Here, let's test you. I'm going to write down,
(stammering) "Oh, what a goose I am." Copy my handwriting.

00:12:16.506 --> 00:12:17.219
LAURA: Okay.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:24.442
MATT: (laughing)

00:12:24.442 --> 00:12:25.726
SAM: It's pretty good.

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:27.728
(laughter)

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.552
MATT: I was going to make you roll for it, but no,
you got this.

00:12:35.752 --> 00:12:41.388
MARISHA: Nott, I think we’re going to need you to
both break in the house and also maybe into some

00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:42.984
safe that they have in there.

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:44.217
SAM: Me?

00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:46.402
MARISHA: Yeah, you're good at lockpicking.

00:12:46.402 --> 00:12:49.777
SAM: Okay. Will I be in there alone?

00:12:49.777 --> 00:12:51.547
MARISHA: No, we’ll be with you.

00:12:51.747 --> 00:12:57.545
LIAM: We will decide who goes in. I also want to
discuss what exactly we are going to forge before

00:12:57.545 --> 00:13:02.243
we go in, because the plan that they laid out for
us was not good.

00:13:03.478 --> 00:13:04.936
MARISHA: You can say it.

00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:13.762
LIAM: <i>Scheisse</i> is a word for it, but they talked
about making it look like Sutan had broken into

00:13:13.762 --> 00:13:21.114
Prucine's home and rolled it. I don't know what
effect that would have on her, so I think maybe we

00:13:21.114 --> 00:13:29.441
hatch some sort of conspiracy between the two of
them to assassinate Orentha, so we will go to

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:34.256
Sutan's house and we will leave--

00:13:36.686 --> 00:13:37.484
SAM: I’m drinking.

00:13:42.484 --> 00:13:45.130
MARISHA: Nott, what was the last thing Caleb
said?

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:48.934
SAM: I always listen to Caleb, he's my right-hand
man.

00:13:48.934 --> 00:13:50.222
MARISHA: What did he say?

00:13:50.222 --> 00:13:50.726
SAM: Poutine.

00:13:50.726 --> 00:13:55.785
MARISHA: That’s not what he said, but that is
delicious and now I want some.

00:13:56.715 --> 00:14:01.793
LIAM: Follow me please, for a moment. We have to
do our homework first, but after we do homework,

00:14:01.793 --> 00:14:10.514
we go to Sutan's, we find this seal, we hold onto
it. We leave fake communication that you will

00:14:10.514 --> 00:14:15.519
write that is from the High-Richter, calling for a
hit.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:20.304
LAURA: But how will we leave something from the
High-Richter if I don't know actually what her

00:14:20.304 --> 00:14:22.278
handwriting looks like yet?

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:27.484
TRAVIS: I was thinking, do they have post here in
this city? Someone that comes and picks up mail?

00:14:27.484 --> 00:14:29.302
Could we jack some of her fucking outgoing mail?

00:14:29.302 --> 00:14:30.508
LIAM: You have stolen mail.

00:14:30.508 --> 00:14:31.227
MARISHA: I have.

00:14:31.507 --> 00:14:32.775
LIAM: You can do it again.

00:14:32.775 --> 00:14:34.583
SAM: You're proficient in mail fraud.

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:36.230
MARISHA: I am definitely proficient in mail fraud.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.500
TRAVIS: What time is it?

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.529
MATT: It's later afternoon.

00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:40.649
TRAVIS: What's the exact time? No, I'm just
kidding.

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:41.935
MATT: Don't pull a Liam.

00:14:41.935 --> 00:14:44.630
MARISHA: There would be a public record somewhere,
right?

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.849
LAURA: A public record of her handwriting?

00:14:47.849 --> 00:14:52.794
SAM: Well, if she’s issued any sort of royal,
official things, yeah, there should be some sort

00:14:52.794 --> 00:14:53.316
of record.

00:14:53.316 --> 00:14:54.919
LAURA: She is a judge after all, right?

00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:59.255
MARISHA: And generally those public records tend
to need to be open for--

00:15:01.465 --> 00:15:04.953
TALIESIN: These are the most intense public
officials I've ever attempted to swindle, so I'm

00:15:04.953 --> 00:15:06.687
not entirely sure what we do at this level.

00:15:06.687 --> 00:15:12.136
MARISHA: Well, I will say, worst case scenario, we
don't necessarily need to match her handwriting,

00:15:12.136 --> 00:15:20.913
but some type of coding, potentially linked back
to her. We can almost mimic it. People who are

00:15:20.913 --> 00:15:23.329
doing sneaky things never use their real
handwriting.

00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:28.652
TALIESIN: Leave a mark on a tree, etcetera. if you
agree to these terms, and then we leave a mark on

00:15:28.652 --> 00:15:29.760
a tree, similar sort of thing.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.207
MARISHA: Sure. Maybe some accounts of the Myriad.

00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:36.334
TALIESIN: A bag of gold in a trash receptacle.

00:15:36.334 --> 00:15:37.939
TRAVIS: What the fuck are you talking about?

00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:40.325
SAM: We're leaving a bag of gold in a trash
receptacle?

00:15:40.325 --> 00:15:44.050
TALIESIN: I'm saying that there's nothing to
commit proof other than money actually exchanging

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:50.680
hands. We used money for these things all the time
back in my day. So if that letter asks for some

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.113
sort of assurance or some sort of money to be
placed: "Please hire a couple people, you can

00:15:57.113 --> 00:16:01.151
leave some money in this location for them," and
if they find that money, then they know they

00:16:01.151 --> 00:16:04.242
actually consented and agreed to this whole
argument.

00:16:04.242 --> 00:16:05.536
LAURA: This is very complicated.

00:16:05.536 --> 00:16:06.459
SAM: Extremely.

00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:07.444
TALIESIN: It isn't that complicated.

00:16:07.444 --> 00:16:11.510
TRAVIS: What if we divide our forces for now and
try to find that handwriting sample? One of us

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.625
goes and looks for the post, the other one tries
to find those public records.

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:18.213
LAURA: What if I go find the High-Richter and ask
for her autograph?

00:16:19.983 --> 00:16:21.113
SAM: Like you'd be a fan?

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:21.482
LAURA: Yeah!

00:16:21.482 --> 00:16:23.358
TALIESIN: I don't know if Richters have fans.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:24.859
TRAVIS: Yeah, she was kind of unpleasant.

00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:26.352
LAURA: Really?

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:29.570
TRAVIS: Yeah, she wasn't really about that fan
life.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.571
LIAM: Did not care about your buttons.

00:16:31.571 --> 00:16:34.872
LAURA: That’s right. She was vain.

00:16:36.222 --> 00:16:42.352
LIAM: The goal to be that we leave something in
Sutan's house that would make it seem that the

00:16:42.352 --> 00:16:49.214
High-Richter has ordered a hit on Orentha and we
leave something behind in Sutan's house: fake

00:16:49.214 --> 00:16:54.307
communications with the Myriad. So we tie Sutan to
the Myriad, we tie Sutan to Richter, and then at

00:16:54.307 --> 00:17:01.927
Richter's house, we leave forged documents, we
have a letter from Sutan with the seal, and also

00:17:01.927 --> 00:17:06.303
we leave communication with the Knights,
whatsit--

00:17:06.303 --> 00:17:11.503
MARISHA: --of Requital. Where I thought you were
going, Molly, which isn't a bad idea to leave some

00:17:11.503 --> 00:17:19.206
sort of money trail, is leave a certain amount of
money with any type of paperwork that might also

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:27.200
be mentioned in a document in the adjacent house.
So paranoid rich people are always paranoid rich

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.073
people, right? So they always have these safes
filled with documents.

00:17:32.073 --> 00:17:34.134
LAURA: Oh yes, we had one of those at our house.

00:17:36.194 --> 00:17:37.484
MARISHA: Were you guys paranoid?

00:17:37.484 --> 00:17:39.369
LAURA: Well, no, we just had a lot of secrets.

00:17:39.369 --> 00:17:41.798
(silence)

00:17:41.798 --> 00:17:42.497
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:17:42.497 --> 00:17:45.677
TALIESIN: I'm baffled by the notion of building a
box inside of a larger box inside of a larger box

00:17:45.677 --> 00:17:46.721
to hold papers, but fine.

00:17:46.721 --> 00:17:53.093
SAM: Step one is: find documents. This is the most
exciting thing we’ve ever done.

00:17:54.203 --> 00:17:56.021
MARISHA: We also need to find where Lord Sutan
lives.

00:17:56.021 --> 00:17:59.147
SAM: Oh! So find addresses <i>and</i> documents!

00:17:59.147 --> 00:18:00.055
MARISHA: Correct.

00:18:00.055 --> 00:18:01.925
SAM: Ooh! Cue the music.

00:18:02.725 --> 00:18:08.277
LAURA: I bet that the people in the Knights--
previously Knights-- they would know where Lord

00:18:08.277 --> 00:18:09.819
Sutan lives.

00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:14.114
MARISHA: They might even have some sort of
documentation or record. Remember Dolan was saying

00:18:14.114 --> 00:18:20.848
that they got ousted from their practice because
of this Lord Sutan. Maybe they already have a

00:18:20.848 --> 00:18:21.535
paper trail.

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:23.693
LAURA: Don't we know where Dolan lives?

00:18:23.693 --> 00:18:26.064
MARISHA: We do. Nott tracked them.

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:30.818
SAM: I do. I saw their home? He lived--

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:33.275
LAURA: Oh, yes. Harold? Horris.

00:18:33.275 --> 00:18:36.204
LIAM: Also, they will put out of businesses, if
possible, they have some sort of paperwork that

00:18:36.204 --> 00:18:38.170
would come from the desk of the High-Richter.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.008
TRAVIS: Possibly, but if we go by there, we can't
be seen.

00:18:41.008 --> 00:18:45.737
LAURA: We can't be seen. We'd have to be in
disguise, or one of us.

00:18:45.737 --> 00:18:48.058
TRAVIS: Or knock on the back door, if such a thing
exists.

00:18:48.058 --> 00:18:51.203
TALIESIN: Let's start by talking to our friends
before we start investigating our allies.

00:18:51.203 --> 00:18:53.449
LAURA: Yes. Let's go that way.

00:18:53.449 --> 00:18:55.223
MARISHA: Do we have any--

00:18:55.223 --> 00:18:56.707
LAURA: Go get him, monk.

00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:06.361
MARISHA: That's going to be really cool when I can
do that. Really cool. Catch a fly. Anyway, moving

00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:07.517
on, that was me.

00:19:07.517 --> 00:19:08.724
LAURA: Should we go to Dolan's house?

00:19:08.724 --> 00:19:09.491
SAM: All of us?

00:19:09.491 --> 00:19:12.935
TRAVIS: Is that how we want to find Lord Sutan's
address?

00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:16.648
LAURA: Maybe the Richter's handwriting, too.

00:19:16.648 --> 00:19:18.306
MARISHA: I wonder if we can track down Ulog.

00:19:18.306 --> 00:19:20.004
TRAVIS: That seems like a good idea.

00:19:20.004 --> 00:19:20.655
SAM: One thing at a time.

00:19:20.655 --> 00:19:24.835
LIAM: That's another thing-- and we can table
this-- but there is also the possibility that this

00:19:24.835 --> 00:19:29.716
is all just a honey trap, and that we’re being
drawn in for as big a fish than the Knights are themselves.

00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:31.436
MARISHA: You think we're big fish?

00:19:33.704 --> 00:19:37.534
LIAM: Well, I think that they think they are
looking for potentially big fish. I'm not saying

00:19:37.534 --> 00:19:44.057
that we are big fish. But we might be walking into
a trap, so eyes on a swivel, is all I’m saying.

00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:47.493
TRAVIS: So you're saying Ulog probably is in
trouble and is going to roll over on us in order

00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:48.503
to get something taken off of him.

00:19:48.503 --> 00:19:52.798
LIAM: Potentially, or any of them. Ulog seems the
shiftiest, but that doesn't mean that he would

00:19:52.798 --> 00:19:53.671
necessarily be--

00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:55.775
LAURA: Ulog’s probably listening to us right now.

00:19:55.775 --> 00:19:56.998
TRAVIS: To Dolan's, then.

00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.085
SAM: All of us? All right, let's go.

00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:05.941
MATT: All right. You guys make your way, following
Nott, who had previously trailed Dolan to the

00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:16.472
home, and you eventually find your way to the
outskirts of a very simple-- it’s a hovel, but

00:20:16.472 --> 00:20:22.702
only because it's been in disuse for a while.
There is a single front door, it looks to be a

00:20:22.702 --> 00:20:28.046
two-chamber home, with one large central main
living space and one bedroom in the back. The roof

00:20:28.046 --> 00:20:37.547
itself is made of heavily pressed-together thatch
and stick. As soon as you approach, you can see

00:20:37.547 --> 00:20:41.238
that the front door is closed, and you see a
little bit of movement through the window, someone

00:20:41.238 --> 00:20:41.742
walking around.

00:20:41.742 --> 00:20:44.406
SAM: Who wants to go knocky-knocky?

00:20:44.406 --> 00:20:46.895
LAURA: We shouldn't be seen with them.

00:20:46.895 --> 00:20:49.770
TRAVIS: Yeah, you said there's no back door,
right? Side windows, anything like that?

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.592
SAM: No, I just saw a window and a door. Right?

00:20:52.592 --> 00:20:54.130
MATT: From what you saw, yeah.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.248
TRAVIS: Well, it should be one of the three of us,
because that's who they'll know.

00:20:57.248 --> 00:20:58.960
LIAM: You two have been speaking to them the
longest.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.539
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:21:00.229 --> 00:21:01.000
LAURA: Go do it, Fjord.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.179
LIAM: You are a good talker, Fjord.

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:03.839
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:21:04.449 --> 00:21:05.896
SAM: In disguise or as is?

00:21:05.896 --> 00:21:10.325
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to fucking change it up.
Is there a little alley that I can pop into before

00:21:10.325 --> 00:21:12.355
I head over to his place of residence?

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:16.840
MATT: Yeah, two buildings over, you look off to
the side and there's a small alcove of shade where

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.275
you could probably pop in quickly and dispense a
spell without it causing any ruckus.

00:21:20.275 --> 00:21:24.796
TRAVIS: Yeah, I cast Disguise Self and I turn back
into that-- black cloak with gold trim, the long

00:21:24.796 --> 00:21:25.270
black hair--

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.175
MATT: The same figure you brought to the
High-Richter's?

00:21:27.175 --> 00:21:27.683
TRAVIS: That's right.

00:21:27.683 --> 00:21:28.245
MATT: All right.

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.386
MARISHA: I tie my robe.

00:21:30.716 --> 00:21:31.464
MATT: Okay.

00:21:31.464 --> 00:21:32.007
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:21:32.487 --> 00:21:33.715
MARISHA: It's all I've got.

00:21:33.715 --> 00:21:34.653
MATT: Doesn't take a spell slot.

00:21:34.653 --> 00:21:41.303
LAURA: You're not going up there with him, right?
Because he's in disguise now. You look the same, Beau.

00:21:41.308 --> 00:21:42.037
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you look like you--

00:21:42.037 --> 00:21:43.673
MARISHA: No, I got that. Yeah.

00:21:43.673 --> 00:21:45.827
TRAVIS: We don't want to have them see us going
over there.

00:21:45.827 --> 00:21:47.057
MARISHA: Okay, well then you go.

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:47.686
TRAVIS: Cool. All right.

00:21:47.686 --> 00:21:49.108
MARISHA: Feel free to give me like a--

00:21:49.698 --> 00:21:50.798
TRAVIS: Oh, what's the sign?

00:21:52.198 --> 00:21:53.251
LAURA: (screeching bird call)

00:21:53.251 --> 00:21:54.329
LIAM: No, that's not it.

00:21:54.329 --> 00:21:55.326
TRAVIS: A peacock?

00:21:57.466 --> 00:21:58.566
LAURA: I thought that was a hawk.

00:21:58.566 --> 00:21:59.785
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:03.442
TRAVIS: Was that supposed to be a hawk? A pigeon?
(pigeon cooing)

00:22:03.442 --> 00:22:04.212
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

00:22:04.212 --> 00:22:06.377
TRAVIS: Fair enough, it's a pigeon. A feral
pigeon.

00:22:06.377 --> 00:22:08.095
MARISHA: I'll listen for the pigeon.

00:22:08.095 --> 00:22:09.681
LIAM: A peacock is a fancy pet.

00:22:09.681 --> 00:22:10.883
SAM: What are we signaling for?

00:22:10.883 --> 00:22:12.093
TRAVIS: If there's trouble.

00:22:12.093 --> 00:22:13.836
LAURA and SAM: Okay.

00:22:13.836 --> 00:22:14.551
TRAVIS: All right.

00:22:14.551 --> 00:22:15.929
MARISHA: There's a signal, we have one.

00:22:15.929 --> 00:22:17.538
TRAVIS: I walk over to Dolan's house.

00:22:17.538 --> 00:22:18.988
MATT: All right. Knock on the door?

00:22:18.988 --> 00:22:20.711
LIAM: What happens if a pigeon goes by?

00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:21.585
(laughter)

00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:23.760
SAM: A flock of pigeons come down.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.770
LIAM: (spell noises)

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:31.978
MATT: All right. As you knock on the door, there's
a pause, and you see out of the corner of the

00:22:31.978 --> 00:22:39.501
window, the edge of a face peek out there, and
then disappear behind, and a voice goes, "Who is it?"

00:22:39.996 --> 00:22:47.366
TRAVIS: Yes, it is-- I bring word from the Mighty
Nein. May I come in, please?

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:51.470
MATT: You hear some rustling, some unlocking
process, and the door opens up and you can see

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:57.391
Horris opens the door and Dolan's behind. "Yes,
please, come in." Looks just past you as you enter

00:22:57.391 --> 00:22:59.099
the building and they close the door behind you.

00:22:59.099 --> 00:23:02.674
TRAVIS: Is there anyone in the room that I don't
see besides Horris and Dolan?

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:03.879
MATT: It's just the two of them at the moment.

00:23:03.879 --> 00:23:05.122
MARISHA: Do I see-- sorry.

00:23:05.122 --> 00:23:07.211
TRAVIS: I'll drop the disguise.

00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:14.015
MATT: Okay. They both pause for a second. "Oh,
wow, all right, you are as skilled as they say, it

00:23:14.015 --> 00:23:15.671
seems. That's pretty useful."

00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:19.085
TRAVIS: I apologize. We realize that after you--
(drawl) I apologize.

00:23:19.085 --> 00:23:21.263
(laughter)

00:23:21.263 --> 00:23:26.625
TRAVIS: After we finished speaking, we realized we
weren't aware of where Lord Sutan resided.

00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:34.033
MATT: "Oh, right. His abode-- he lives in the
Gilded Willows in the Tri-Spires."

00:23:35.463 --> 00:23:36.542
MARISHA: Knew that much.

00:23:36.542 --> 00:23:45.377
MATT: "He's, I would say, not too terribly far
from the Skyscape Park and where the Constellation

00:23:45.377 --> 00:23:54.873
Bridge tower stands. It's a three-story house,
dark wood, gold leaf carving. It's a bit gaudy,

00:23:54.873 --> 00:23:58.833
hard to miss amongst some of the other ones there,
although all of them are gaudy in their own right.

00:23:58.833 --> 00:24:05.379
Look for the three-story, iron-gated, dark
greenwood building in that vicinity."

00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:10.432
TRAVIS: Great. Will do. Another thing that we
realized-- in our efforts to frame and forge,

00:24:10.432 --> 00:24:15.636
which are vast, you don't happen to have any
handwriting from Lord Sutan, do you?

00:24:15.636 --> 00:24:21.593
MATT: "Unfortunately, no, most lords are very
careful with documentation transfer back and

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:24.125
forth, they usually go through direct parcel
services."

00:24:24.495 --> 00:24:28.520
TRAVIS: There was nothing that ousted you from
your business, any sort of receipt, or--

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:36.469
MATT: "Oh, no. (chuckles) Nothing that was
directly from his hand, at least. They usually go

00:24:36.469 --> 00:24:38.267
through intermediaries for that purpose."

00:24:38.267 --> 00:24:41.652
TRAVIS: Is there anyone else in the area that we
should know that he does business with, that he

00:24:41.652 --> 00:24:43.645
might communicate with regularly?

00:24:43.645 --> 00:24:51.078
MATT: "I mean, that would be the one that replaced
us--" And he nudges over to Horris on the side.

00:24:51.078 --> 00:24:59.898
"That would be--" I had that written down.
Somewhere in here. Oh, shit, it's my older notes.

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:03.005
TRAVIS: There's a pen pal. And finding out who the
pen pal is--

00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:03.781
MATT: Exactly.

00:25:03.781 --> 00:25:05.139
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

00:25:05.139 --> 00:25:08.180
MARISHA: This is really good all to know. Now
we're getting all this information.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.715
LAURA and SAM: (as pigeons) High-Richter!

00:25:09.715 --> 00:25:11.400
TRAVIS: No, there's no fucking pigeons.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.674
LAURA: (as pigeon) High-Richter's handwriting!

00:25:15.674 --> 00:25:17.979
MATT: "I believe it's Ren Sutan."

00:25:17.979 --> 00:25:19.040
TRAVIS: Ren Sutan.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.462
MATT: "Yes." If not, the Internet will correct
me.

00:25:21.462 --> 00:25:23.180
SAM: Ren Sutan is his name?

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.605
TRAVIS: That's who he wrote to, though.

00:25:24.605 --> 00:25:26.903
LAURA: Oh, I thought Sutan was a title, like Lord
Lord Lord.

00:25:26.903 --> 00:25:30.026
MATT: "Oh, no, Lord Diedric Sutan is his name,
Ren--"

00:25:30.026 --> 00:25:31.048
TRAVIS: It's who he wrote to.

00:25:31.718 --> 00:25:38.086
MATT: "Ren is his son who he placed to destroy and
take over our practice."

00:25:39.736 --> 00:25:41.919
TRAVIS: Well, he sounds like a real son of a
bitch.

00:25:43.499 --> 00:25:46.358
MATT: You hear Horris, off to the side, arms
crossed now, hearing all this, goes, "Yeah, you

00:25:46.358 --> 00:25:47.209
could say that."

00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:52.488
TRAVIS: This Ren Sutan, any idea where we might be
able to find him?

00:25:53.728 --> 00:26:01.995
MATT: They both look at each other, and you watch
as Dolan glances out the window. "Not that far

00:26:01.995 --> 00:26:13.799
outside of the Apple Tree Tutorship vicinity, you
will find a white and peach building, with a few

00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:18.132
banners in the front, and that's Ren's new
practice."

00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:20.071
TRAVIS: A physician also.

00:26:20.071 --> 00:26:20.841
MATT: "Yes."

00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:23.710
TRAVIS: A dark physician, most likely, hmm?

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:29.682
MATT: "I mean, sure." He looks confused.

00:26:29.682 --> 00:26:32.116
(laughter)

00:26:33.706 --> 00:26:37.329
MATT: "Dark physicianry I guess is an issue in
some parts of the world, I suppose?"

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:41.609
TRAVIS: Yeah, rampant where I'm from. Just real
fucking dark.

00:26:42.729 --> 00:26:47.219
MATT: He looks back at Horris. Horris is like,
"Right. Well, if you come across any dark

00:26:47.219 --> 00:26:53.229
physicianry, please do your best to quell it where
it... seeds."

00:26:53.229 --> 00:26:56.829
(laughter)

00:26:56.829 --> 00:26:57.970
TRAVIS: Indeed I will. Indeed.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:58.719
MATT: "Thank you."

00:26:59.479 --> 00:27:02.557
TRAVIS: You probably will not be hearing from us
again before the task is done.

00:27:02.557 --> 00:27:04.465
SAM and LAURA: (as pigeons) High-Richter!

00:27:04.465 --> 00:27:05.113
TRAVIS: No.

00:27:07.483 --> 00:27:09.926
LAURA: (as pigeon) We need it more! High-Richter!

00:27:09.926 --> 00:27:12.723
(laughter)

00:27:12.723 --> 00:27:14.219
TALIESIN: I keep trying to make a sound, it's just
nothing's working.

00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:15.673
TRAVIS: Was I supposed to say stuff about the
High-Richter?

00:27:15.673 --> 00:27:18.477
MARISHA: I don't know, I'd say take the
foot-in-mouth signal.

00:27:20.207 --> 00:27:23.288
LAURA: We need the handwriting of the High-Richter
more than Lord Sutan's handwriting.

00:27:23.288 --> 00:27:23.749
MATT: You're not there.

00:27:23.749 --> 00:27:24.484
LAURA: (exasperated sound)

00:27:24.484 --> 00:27:27.246
(laughter)

00:27:27.246 --> 00:27:28.181
SAM: We blew it.

00:27:28.181 --> 00:27:29.351
LAURA: Fuck! (as pigeon) High-Richter!

00:27:29.351 --> 00:27:30.541
SAM: (as pigeon) High-Richter!

00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:33.222
TRAVIS: Thank you. We won't trouble you any
longer.

00:27:33.222 --> 00:27:42.823
MATT: "No worries. I suppose since-- Tomorrow
evening, when everything's set to go, me and

00:27:42.823 --> 00:27:48.455
Horris, Kara, we're not going to be present when
all of this goes down, so we have deniability when

00:27:48.455 --> 00:27:54.703
we turn our information in for this whole
endeavor, but I think Ulog and you guys should

00:27:54.703 --> 00:27:59.173
meet on the outside of the tavern that we met at
earlier today to kick this off."

00:27:59.173 --> 00:28:00.044
TRAVIS: Song and Supper Inn.

00:28:00.044 --> 00:28:00.972
MATT: "You got it."

00:28:00.972 --> 00:28:01.790
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.342
MATT: "Well good luck, and--"

00:28:04.342 --> 00:28:06.865
MARISHA: (drawl) Mustard. Biscuits.

00:28:06.865 --> 00:28:09.106
LIAM: (drawl) You're just a little feller, you
oughtn’t talk like that.

00:28:09.106 --> 00:28:10.193
TRAVIS: Lock that door behind me, and I leave.

00:28:10.193 --> 00:28:11.419
MATT: All right. Locks the door.

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:13.311
SAM: How did it go?

00:28:13.311 --> 00:28:14.806
LAURA: Did you get the handwriting?

00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:15.656
TRAVIS: Stupid pigeons.

00:28:15.656 --> 00:28:18.671
SAM and LAURA: Did you get the handwriting of the
High-Richter?

00:28:18.671 --> 00:28:23.389
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm not sharing it. Yep. Got it.
Got it, no problem. Read it, looked at it, I

00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:25.168
understand what it looks like. Let's go.

00:28:25.168 --> 00:28:27.432
(laughter)

00:28:27.432 --> 00:28:29.578
LAURA: Fjord, we need it. Really bad.

00:28:29.578 --> 00:28:31.235
TRAVIS: Nope, sorry, not going to help you.

00:28:31.235 --> 00:28:31.910
LAURA: Did you not get it?

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:32.963
MARISHA: What did they say, though?

00:28:32.963 --> 00:28:35.874
TRAVIS: A whole bunch of stuff, but I can't say it
around them, I just won’t, out of principle.

00:28:35.874 --> 00:28:37.349
MARISHA: Okay. All right. Yep.

00:28:37.349 --> 00:28:41.247
LIAM: Yeah, but actually do you think you could go
back and say that you forgot to ask a question?

00:28:43.447 --> 00:28:47.663
LAURA: Just say, hey, the whole point of this was
to find the High-Richter's handwriting as well,

00:28:47.663 --> 00:28:48.463
and maybe--

00:28:48.463 --> 00:28:51.515
LIAM: I understand that these two are really
busting your balls, and I commiserate with that,

00:28:51.515 --> 00:28:53.919
but we do need in fact to ask.

00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:57.672
TRAVIS: Now, see, if you ask nicely, yeah, things
will ha-- I walk back up to the door.

00:28:57.672 --> 00:29:01.141
(laughter)

00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:02.252
TRAVIS: Knock-knock-knock.

00:29:03.712 --> 00:29:05.279
MATT: The eye peeks through the window once
again.

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:06.113
TRAVIS: One more thing.

00:29:06.683 --> 00:29:07.840
MATT: (door opening)

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.384
MARISHA: I'm keeping an eye out for anyone
watching.

00:29:09.384 --> 00:29:13.441
TRAVIS: Totally forgot to ask, you don't happen to
have any handwriting from the High-Richter do you?

00:29:13.731 --> 00:29:15.815
MATT: "No, that would make this a lot easier."

00:29:15.815 --> 00:29:16.537
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know.

00:29:16.537 --> 00:29:18.898
(laughter)

00:29:18.898 --> 00:29:19.597
TRAVIS: Great.

00:29:19.597 --> 00:29:20.144
MATT: "Sorry."

00:29:20.144 --> 00:29:21.613
TRAVIS: Have a good day.

00:29:21.613 --> 00:29:22.854
MATT: "You too." (door closing)

00:29:22.854 --> 00:29:24.263
TRAVIS: No. None.

00:29:24.263 --> 00:29:27.539
LIAM: Okay, well, we checked that box off, so now
we have to get to work.

00:29:28.401 --> 00:29:32.939
SAM: We got some good information, we got Sutan's
address and Ren's address.

00:29:32.939 --> 00:29:36.213
TRAVIS: Yeah. Blah blah blah, Ren's address and
the address. Now you got it.

00:29:36.213 --> 00:29:37.357
SAM: Oh my god!

00:29:37.357 --> 00:29:39.304
MARISHA: Oh, and it's super interesting--

00:29:39.304 --> 00:29:42.023
LAURA: Whoa, that is really good, Fjord, you did a
really good job in there.

00:29:42.023 --> 00:29:46.235
MARISHA: Also super interesting that they
mentioned having other people do their work for

00:29:46.235 --> 00:29:50.489
them. (pause) Okay, let's go!

00:29:52.179 --> 00:29:52.922
TRAVIS: Was that mentioned?

00:29:53.932 --> 00:29:57.683
MARISHA: He said they have other people do parcel
service and stuff for him.

00:29:57.683 --> 00:29:59.811
TRAVIS: Oh, okay, yeah, that. Blah.

00:29:59.811 --> 00:30:00.606
MARISHA: See?

00:30:00.606 --> 00:30:05.691
SAM: So you're saying that we could use other
handwriting as well, and it wouldn't be out of the

00:30:05.691 --> 00:30:10.467
ordinary, as long as it beared the signature and
seal of said place?

00:30:10.467 --> 00:30:15.250
MARISHA: Well maybe not even a signature. Most
people trying to be smart about not getting caught

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:19.319
aren't probably like my name and social security
number.

00:30:19.319 --> 00:30:23.533
LAURA: What if we get some parchment that says
from the home office of Lord Sutan?

00:30:23.533 --> 00:30:25.193
SAM: Ooh, a letterhead.

00:30:25.193 --> 00:30:26.669
MARISHA: You want stationery, sure.

00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:29.331
TALIESIN: Beyond actual, personal stationery. I
think the notion would be is that you would

00:30:29.331 --> 00:30:33.636
actually send your actual handwriting in something
like this because that way they would know that it

00:30:34.007 --> 00:30:39.502
was you. You would be very careful how and who you
would send that through. You wouldn't want a

00:30:39.502 --> 00:30:42.579
second person taking dictation as you plotted to
overthrow the government.

00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:45.986
MARISHA: Okay well how about this, I think the
seal is going to be good; I think any type of

00:30:45.986 --> 00:30:51.516
money amount mentioned in any of the letters and
then we cross that and leave that type of amount

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:54.749
of gold in the-- like there's been a money hand
off.

00:30:54.749 --> 00:30:59.100
TRAVIS: We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's
stay on task. Let's head to the Gilded Willows

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:05.347
where in the Tri-Spire, where the fucking
Scottsdale party-- What do these notes say,

00:31:05.347 --> 00:31:07.954
Skyskate Park and Constellation Boulevard.

00:31:07.954 --> 00:31:08.829
LIAM: Knotts Berry Farm.

00:31:08.829 --> 00:31:09.871
SAM: Constellation Bridge.

00:31:09.871 --> 00:31:10.575
TRAVIS: Yeah that thing.

00:31:10.575 --> 00:31:11.442
SAM: Constellation Bridge.

00:31:11.442 --> 00:31:12.927
MATT: Constellation Bridge tower and Skyscape
Park.

00:31:12.927 --> 00:31:15.541
MARISHA: In between Adventureland and
Frontierland.

00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:16.682
(laughter)

00:31:16.682 --> 00:31:17.635
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was writing real fast.

00:31:17.635 --> 00:31:20.073
TALIESIN: It's good there's a bathroom on the way
to that. That works out well.

00:31:20.073 --> 00:31:20.722
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:20.722 --> 00:31:23.502
SAM: So we're going there with the express purpose
of--?

00:31:23.502 --> 00:31:28.806
TRAVIS: Just recon. We're trying to see what this
place looks like, if we can see Lord Sutan. Then

00:31:28.806 --> 00:31:33.178
we'll make a decision if we go after his son or
not. Who maybe has some of his handwriting.

00:31:33.178 --> 00:31:36.312
SAM: That's in the Tri-Spire. So we need to go
through the sewers to get there.

00:31:36.312 --> 00:31:37.151
TALIESIN: Maybe a birthday card.

00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:44.168
LAURA: Or we can go up, a few of us, through the
actual front gates and then meet up with everyone.

00:31:44.168 --> 00:31:50.246
MARISHA: Okay, well how about half of us go to
Lord Sutan's and half of us go check out Ren's.

00:31:51.196 --> 00:31:51.829
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:31:51.829 --> 00:31:52.126
LAURA: Okay.

00:31:53.236 --> 00:31:55.167
SAM: What are we looking for at Ren's?

00:31:55.457 --> 00:31:56.114
TRAVIS: Handwriting.

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:58.590
SAM: Okay, from his papa.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.181
TRAVIS: And see if Ren's a son of a bitch. Yeah.

00:32:00.181 --> 00:32:00.629
SAM: Okay.

00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:02.374
MARISHA: I'll go to check out Ren.

00:32:02.374 --> 00:32:05.082
TRAVIS: Yeah me too, because I can't make it
through the gates.

00:32:05.082 --> 00:32:05.500
LAURA: Oh.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.015
SAM: I don't think anyone can make it through the
gates, except for you.

00:32:08.015 --> 00:32:09.606
TRAVIS: That's what I was wondering what you were
talking about.

00:32:09.606 --> 00:32:11.643
TALIESIN: I thought we were going to take the
sewer to get in there.

00:32:11.643 --> 00:32:15.717
LAURA: I thought Beau might be able to get through
the gates, actually.

00:32:15.717 --> 00:32:17.310
MARISHA: I could get through the gate.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.612
LAURA: Huh?

00:32:18.612 --> 00:32:19.770
TRAVIS: Because she's got a cloak now.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.599
LAURA: Yeah and it's not a magical disguise.

00:32:22.599 --> 00:32:23.314
MARISHA: Okay.

00:32:24.964 --> 00:32:25.520
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.917
MARISHA: I'll go check out-- yeah.

00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:27.538
LAURA: Okay.

00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:29.773
TRAVIS: Caleb, where you want to go buddy?

00:32:29.773 --> 00:32:31.489
LIAM: I will go to Sutan's.

00:32:31.489 --> 00:32:32.927
TRAVIS: Wait, they're both Sutan.

00:32:33.437 --> 00:32:35.489
LIAM: No, the elder, I'm sorry.

00:32:35.489 --> 00:32:37.733
SAM: Will you be able to get in?

00:32:37.733 --> 00:32:39.315
LIAM: Not without you. You'll come with me?

00:32:39.315 --> 00:32:42.303
SAM: We'll sneak on in through the sewers?

00:32:42.303 --> 00:32:44.016
LIAM: Well how do you want to do it?

00:32:44.016 --> 00:32:47.106
SAM: They're talking about going straight in
through the gate because they're, you know, respectable.

00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:51.588
LAURA: (distraught) Well it's such a thing to get
into the sewers. We have to make a distraction and

00:32:51.588 --> 00:32:52.959
everything, every time.

00:32:55.469 --> 00:32:59.364
TALIESIN: Perhaps we should just have a two person
reconnaissance for now.

00:32:59.364 --> 00:32:59.909
LAURA: Right.

00:32:59.909 --> 00:33:01.556
MARISHA: We can manage ourselves.

00:33:01.556 --> 00:33:02.078
LIAM: Okay.

00:33:02.078 --> 00:33:02.786
MARISHA: We're good.

00:33:02.786 --> 00:33:05.206
LAURA: Yes, we won't get into any trouble.

00:33:05.206 --> 00:33:07.411
TRAVIS: Yeah, you won't bring back Clarota or
nothing, it'll be great.

00:33:07.411 --> 00:33:08.524
LAURA: We know our way around.

00:33:09.714 --> 00:33:10.386
TALIESIN: Too soon.

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:12.070
TRAVIS: Can't be.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.739
MARISHA: We got this, let's go.

00:33:15.739 --> 00:33:20.939
TRAVIS: Should we meet back at the Song &amp; Supper
Inn at what, sunset?

00:33:20.939 --> 00:33:22.063
MARISHA: What time is it?

00:33:22.063 --> 00:33:23.258
LAURA: Or just at the Leaky Tap.

00:33:23.258 --> 00:33:25.009
MATT: You got maybe an hour and half to two hours
before sunset.

00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:26.609
LAURA: Let's just meet back at the Leaky Tap.

00:33:26.609 --> 00:33:27.385
TRAVIS: Okay, fair enough.

00:33:27.385 --> 00:33:27.959
SAM: At the Leaky--

00:33:27.959 --> 00:33:28.733
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:28.733 --> 00:33:31.796
MARISHA: The Leaky or the Song &amp; Supper? We're
talking about two different-- Leaky Tap.

00:33:31.796 --> 00:33:32.433
TRAVIS: Leaky Tap.

00:33:32.433 --> 00:33:33.753
MARISHA: Hour and a half, all right.

00:33:33.753 --> 00:33:34.555
LAURA: Let's go.

00:33:34.555 --> 00:33:35.003
MARISHA: Break.

00:33:35.003 --> 00:33:35.848
LAURA: Woo!

00:33:36.228 --> 00:33:41.961
MATT: You both make your way toward the Tri-Spire.
As you make your way towards the front entry gates

00:33:41.967 --> 00:33:46.441
there, one of the guards posted there is familiar
with you and begins to let you through. As you approach--

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:49.236
MARISHA: I flip it to the blue side, cobalt.

00:33:49.236 --> 00:33:55.077
MATT: As you pass through, a few steps behind
Jester, the guard approaches, “Halt. I don't

00:33:55.077 --> 00:33:56.300
believe I've seen you through here before."

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.225
MARISHA: Oh I'm--

00:33:58.455 --> 00:34:00.616
LAURA: She came through earlier. She's with me.

00:34:02.236 --> 00:34:03.884
MARISHA: Literally like 24 hours ago.

00:34:05.244 --> 00:34:05.950
MATT: "Very well."

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:06.887
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:34:08.227 --> 00:34:12.394
MATT: Steps back. You guys make your way,
following the directions to the Gilded Willows.

00:34:12.394 --> 00:34:18.583
You see the massive tree-tops that fill out the
skyline from your perspective. Every home seems to

00:34:18.583 --> 00:34:24.746
have a row of greenery between. It's a very, very
beautiful neighborhood. You can follow where the

00:34:24.746 --> 00:34:29.342
Constellation Bridge Tower as a beacon and as it
guides you towards its area it doesn't take long

00:34:29.342 --> 00:34:36.378
for you to see the large, gaudy, three-story
complex that is Lord Sutan's home. You can see the

00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:42.749
gold leaf carving along the edges of each of the
various stories in between. The dark green slats

00:34:42.749 --> 00:34:46.297
that are there, are coated in some sort of a
lacquer material that almost glistens in the

00:34:46.297 --> 00:34:50.623
sunlight as it passes. The sunset colors now
starting to make their way into the cloud-covered

00:34:50.623 --> 00:34:59.080
sky. You do see marble pillars at the corner of
the estate's grounds. With iron gates that link

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:05.018
each of them, with about maybe five foot bit of
simple lawn-hill that separates the gap between

00:35:05.018 --> 00:35:06.888
the gate and the building itself.

00:35:06.888 --> 00:35:11.252
MARISHA: Are the gates chained shut or does it
look like there's a lever?

00:35:11.252 --> 00:35:15.820
MATT: Well the gates on all them are solid except
for in the very front and the very back. Both of

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:22.575
them appear to be closed and locked. You do see,
posted at the front of the front door, there are

00:35:22.575 --> 00:35:29.789
two crownsguard that are there keeping watch. On
the back end as you case around to the rear side

00:35:29.789 --> 00:35:33.927
of the home, there is a singular crownsguard and a
dog that is on a chain.

00:35:33.927 --> 00:35:42.031
MARISHA: Two in front. Does it look like there's
any blind spots, any trees that go up and cusp over

00:35:42.031 --> 00:35:42.475
the walls?

00:35:42.475 --> 00:35:44.325
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:35:44.325 --> 00:35:45.277
TRAVIS: Hashtag NBC Blindspot.

00:35:49.513 --> 00:35:52.336
MARISHA: Not good. Eleven.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:59.809
MATT: It's hard to see where any perspective would
be a blind spot. For entry, other than above or

00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:03.921
from the sides because the front and back seem
pretty well covered by these guards, as they're

00:36:03.921 --> 00:36:07.703
currently posted and standing there. So the only
things that really make sense would be either

00:36:07.703 --> 00:36:11.470
flanking the building or something that guides you
over top. That's all you can think of.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.688
LAURA: How high are the buildings next to the
house?

00:36:13.688 --> 00:36:20.122
MATT: The one that is immediately to the left of
it is two-story, it's a shorter building. There is

00:36:20.122 --> 00:36:24.996
a tree to the immediate right of it that rises up
to about the height, if not a little taller, than

00:36:24.996 --> 00:36:29.739
the actual home itself. The building next to it is
another two stories. This one lords over the other

00:36:29.739 --> 00:36:34.722
buildings, but there is one large tree that is
about five feet from the edge of the wall.

00:36:35.712 --> 00:36:37.752
LAURA: Okay. That seems usable.

00:36:39.862 --> 00:36:41.934
MARISHA: It's a big jump but we can do it. It's
not too big.

00:36:41.934 --> 00:36:43.272
LAURA: Like a five feet jump?

00:36:43.272 --> 00:36:44.454
MARISHA: That's doable, yeah.

00:36:44.979 --> 00:36:46.230
LAURA: From, like a swinging branch?

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.474
MARISHA: From rooftop to wall.

00:36:47.474 --> 00:36:52.305
MATT: It's five feet to the wall, and then about
five feet from the wall to the actual building. So

00:36:52.305 --> 00:36:53.910
it's a ten foot from the tree to the roof.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.081
TALIESIN: Could you parkour the wall?

00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:57.473
MATT: You could certainly try.

00:36:57.473 --> 00:36:58.642
MARISHA: That was what I was thinking, wall to
wall.

00:36:58.642 --> 00:36:59.249
SAM: Monk shit.

00:37:00.209 --> 00:37:01.102
TALIESIN: I knew you were already there.

00:37:01.102 --> 00:37:02.532
MARISHA: Do they look like one of the--

00:37:02.532 --> 00:37:06.214
MATT: The gate's about eight feet tall and the
building is three stories. So I mean there are

00:37:06.214 --> 00:37:12.972
some roof-edge perches the stories kinda taper
with each additional floor. So there is a small

00:37:12.972 --> 00:37:17.337
space, maybe a foot, a foot and a half wide that
you could shoot for. If there was something you

00:37:17.337 --> 00:37:18.388
wanted to try but--

00:37:18.388 --> 00:37:20.363
LAURA: Are there windows on that side of the
house?

00:37:21.473 --> 00:37:25.314
MATT: There are no windows on the base floor, or
at least none that you can see. The second floor

00:37:25.314 --> 00:37:31.062
you do see one set of double windows that open.
Though they are currently closed. Those are on the

00:37:31.062 --> 00:37:33.402
two side edges of the building.

00:37:33.402 --> 00:37:34.911
LAURA: Is there a balcony connected to them?

00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:36.124
MATT: No. There's no balcony.

00:37:36.124 --> 00:37:38.172
MARISHA: No balcony. So there appear to be--

00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:42.464
MATT: The only balcony you saw was in the large
balcony at the front of the High-Richter's home,

00:37:42.464 --> 00:37:43.577
but not on this one.

00:37:43.577 --> 00:37:46.387
MARISHA: No balcony, okay.

00:37:49.217 --> 00:37:51.127
LAURA: So a few guards.

00:37:51.127 --> 00:37:51.612
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

00:37:51.612 --> 00:37:52.275
LAURA: A dog.

00:37:52.275 --> 00:37:54.394
MARISHA: A dog, I like dogs.

00:37:54.394 --> 00:37:55.802
LAURA: I love dogs.

00:37:58.502 --> 00:38:02.764
MATT: As you glance at the back of the building,
the doors that you see immediately, there is one

00:38:02.764 --> 00:38:08.568
set of doors that is the front with the two guards
are. The back where the other gate entrance is,

00:38:08.568 --> 00:38:13.867
there isn't another door that leads into the home.
There is a double-cellar door that descends

00:38:13.867 --> 00:38:17.370
beneath. That is what is currently being guarded
with a man and the dog.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:26.756
LAURA: Okay. I wonder if anything would lure the
guards away from the house.

00:38:26.756 --> 00:38:30.660
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe a drunk. A drunkard trying to
break in somewhere else?

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.663
LAURA: Maybe.

00:38:31.663 --> 00:38:35.117
MARISHA: You know, a public disturbance.

00:38:35.117 --> 00:38:38.337
LAURA: Maybe a drunk trying to talk to them in the
front of the house or something.

00:38:38.337 --> 00:38:38.932
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:38:38.932 --> 00:38:39.738
LAURA: Or in the back.

00:38:41.478 --> 00:38:44.320
MARISHA: I mean our group is pretty good at
causing distractions.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.084
LAURA: Yeah.

00:38:45.084 --> 00:38:47.024
MARISHA: They can do that. That's totally-

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:48.831
LAURA: Some people jump up and over?

00:38:48.831 --> 00:38:51.925
MARISHA: Yeah. It's going to have to go fast.

00:38:51.925 --> 00:38:57.338
LAURA: Yeah. Oh man. Maybe we could get some rope
and a grapple.

00:38:57.338 --> 00:38:59.258
MARISHA: Yeah we could do that.

00:38:59.258 --> 00:39:02.759
LAURA: We could throw a grapple for ten feet, I
know that.

00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:07.839
MARISHA: Do I have a climber's kit?

00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:09.358
MATT: Do you have a climber's kit?

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:13.641
MARISHA: I don't have a climber's kit, but we can
go buy a climber's kit.

00:39:13.641 --> 00:39:14.971
LAURA: We can go get a climber's kit.

00:39:14.971 --> 00:39:16.008
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay.

00:39:19.738 --> 00:39:21.361
TRAVIS: I just got a shit-load of ball bearings.

00:39:22.771 --> 00:39:24.170
TALIESIN: I got ball bearings, man.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:30.550
(laughter)

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.219
MARISHA: Guys, let's challenge ourselves. We have
to break in, only using ball bearings.

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:34.597
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:39:34.597 --> 00:39:35.635
MARISHA: How do we do it?

00:39:35.635 --> 00:39:38.127
MATT: The new D&amp;D nightmare mode.

00:39:39.217 --> 00:39:41.282
LIAM: (shiftily) You need some some ball bearings
man?

00:39:42.502 --> 00:39:44.909
MATT: You're all level one bards with nothing but
ball bearings, go.

00:39:46.729 --> 00:39:48.066
TALIESIN: Call me pinball wizard.

00:39:48.066 --> 00:39:51.694
LAURA: We did a good job scouting this place out
and stuff.

00:39:51.694 --> 00:39:57.270
MARISHA: Yeah. Do there seem to be any weak
points, any loose bricks in the walls?

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.913
MATT: Unfortunately--

00:39:59.913 --> 00:40:08.090
MARISHA: As we walk by, I'm playing with the wall,
but I'm testing for weak spots.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:13.711
MATT: Well the wall is an iron gate. They're all
long, iron fencing gate. There are the marble

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:16.719
pillars at the corner of each one. So it's open,
it's a series of bars.

00:40:16.719 --> 00:40:19.638
LAURA: Are they pointy-top iron bars?

00:40:19.638 --> 00:40:21.265
MATT: They are. They are poodle impalers.

00:40:21.265 --> 00:40:21.868
MARISHA: Oh.

00:40:22.458 --> 00:40:24.451
TALIESIN: Yeah that changes things, the
landscape.

00:40:24.451 --> 00:40:26.520
MARISHA: I understand now.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.239
TRAVIS: You can see if it hurts your hand if you
touch it.

00:40:29.229 --> 00:40:30.071
LAURA: I bet it does.

00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:31.615
MARISHA: Oh there's no--

00:40:31.615 --> 00:40:33.930
LAURA: Can you stick your fingers through the
bar?

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.070
MATT: Do you want to try it?

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:35.603
LAURA: Yeah.

00:40:35.603 --> 00:40:36.325
MATT: Okay.

00:40:36.325 --> 00:40:37.038
LIAM: You die.

00:40:37.038 --> 00:40:38.532
MATT: Okay as you place your hand through the
bar--

00:40:38.532 --> 00:40:39.313
TRAVIS: No fucking way.

00:40:39.313 --> 00:40:39.939
MATT: Nothing happens.

00:40:39.939 --> 00:40:41.499
TRAVIS: (laughs) Ah, you son of a bitch.

00:40:41.499 --> 00:40:42.386
MATT: No, it's fine.

00:40:45.166 --> 00:40:45.673
MARISHA: Okay.

00:40:46.463 --> 00:40:47.619
TRAVIS: (vaporized noise)

00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:48.786
LAURA: Disintegrate.

00:40:48.786 --> 00:40:49.368
MATT: Game over.

00:40:49.368 --> 00:40:50.455
TRAVIS: Yeah, new character.

00:40:50.455 --> 00:40:50.846
LAURA: Oh no.

00:40:52.476 --> 00:40:58.082
MARISHA: You know, when I used to hop fences back
where I came from--

00:40:58.082 --> 00:40:58.629
LAURA: Mm-hmm?

00:40:58.629 --> 00:40:59.573
SAM: Where was that?

00:41:00.303 --> 00:41:01.299
MATT: You're not there.

00:41:01.299 --> 00:41:02.559
SAM: Oh I'm not there.

00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:05.940
(laughter)

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.789
MARISHA: If you're ever trying to get over
barbed-wire or any pointy fences, you take a rug

00:41:09.789 --> 00:41:13.382
or a bedroll, and you throw it over there, and you
hop over and you--

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:16.885
LAURA: That's personal Marisha experience isn't
it?

00:41:16.885 --> 00:41:17.717
MARISHA: Yeah I mean--

00:41:17.717 --> 00:41:18.525
TRAVIS: That's some Fight Club shit.

00:41:18.525 --> 00:41:21.231
MARISHA: I'm just throwing that out there. It
works.

00:41:21.231 --> 00:41:22.291
TALIESIN: A plank of wood will work too.

00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:26.167
LAURA: I feel like that would be a really good
idea. I feel like it might be a little noticeable

00:41:26.167 --> 00:41:27.639
to carry around a rug.

00:41:28.249 --> 00:41:29.974
MARISHA: A bedroll is not too bad.

00:41:30.734 --> 00:41:34.331
LAURA: Most people in the Tri-Spire don't carry
around bedrolls.

00:41:34.331 --> 00:41:35.645
LIAM: (coo) Haversack (coo).

00:41:35.645 --> 00:41:37.707
LAURA: Yes but it's little.

00:41:37.707 --> 00:41:38.471
MATT: Shh.

00:41:38.471 --> 00:41:40.023
LAURA: You're not there.

00:41:40.023 --> 00:41:41.442
SAM: It's not him, it's a pigeon.

00:41:41.442 --> 00:41:43.561
MATT: That's true, you're right Sam.

00:41:44.261 --> 00:41:46.711
SAM: There's a metagaming pigeon in this.

00:41:46.711 --> 00:41:48.994
(laughter)

00:41:48.994 --> 00:41:49.752
TRAVIS: (coo) Remember (coo).

00:41:49.752 --> 00:41:51.741
MATT: (coo) Bonus action (coo).

00:41:51.741 --> 00:41:53.635
(laughter)

00:41:53.635 --> 00:41:54.211
TRAVIS: (coo) Hunter's Mark.

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:58.230
(laughter)

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:04.022
MATT: Can we please make the metagaming pigeon a
thing now? I've played with a few in my time.

00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:05.118
(laughter)

00:42:05.118 --> 00:42:06.928
TRAVIS: Turn Undead (coo).

00:42:06.928 --> 00:42:10.891
MATT: All right. Anything else you guys want to do
while you're there?

00:42:12.491 --> 00:42:13.591
LAURA: I think-- are we good?

00:42:13.591 --> 00:42:15.699
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.

00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:18.408
MATT: Okay. Do you guys want and try for a
climber's kit on your way back?

00:42:18.408 --> 00:42:18.964
MARISHA: Sure.

00:42:18.964 --> 00:42:23.642
MATT: Okay. It takes a little bit of time to find
a place because some of the shops are starting to

00:42:23.642 --> 00:42:27.717
close past sunset. The time it took you guys to
get there, do a full casing and come back the sun

00:42:27.717 --> 00:42:31.720
has set and the sky is getting darker. However,
thankfully a climber's kit is not all that

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:42.163
expensive. With a full cost on that-- come on.
Climber's kit-- ha, I was wrong, 25 gold.

00:42:42.163 --> 00:42:43.010
MARISHA: (groans)

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.923
LAURA: What if we don't want the whole kit, just
the grapple part of it and the rope?

00:42:46.923 --> 00:42:47.622
MATT: Just the grappling hook?

00:42:47.622 --> 00:42:48.377
TALIESIN: We have rope.

00:42:48.377 --> 00:42:49.015
MATT: Two gold.

00:42:49.015 --> 00:42:49.983
LAURA: And the rope?

00:42:49.983 --> 00:42:53.433
MARISHA: We're just trying out the gym. We're not
fully committed to it yet.

00:42:53.433 --> 00:42:55.307
MATT: (laughs) Right, can I get a consultation
first?

00:42:56.717 --> 00:42:58.957
LAURA: What is fully included in the climber's
kit?

00:42:58.957 --> 00:43:06.754
MATT: (funny voice) Ah, climber's kit includes a lot of things.
(normal voice) Includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a

00:43:06.754 --> 00:43:11.199
harness. That's for mountain climbing.

00:43:11.209 --> 00:43:12.313
LIAM: CrossFit T-shirt.

00:43:12.313 --> 00:43:12.945
MATT: Yeah.

00:43:12.945 --> 00:43:16.800
TALIESIN: I have pitons, and a hammer, and rope.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.505
MATT: Some nice core balls you can sit on. Yeah,
so you want a grappling hook and rope? You can get

00:43:20.505 --> 00:43:21.479
those. Those are cheaper.

00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:22.819
LAURA: Yes that would probably be a good idea.

00:43:22.819 --> 00:43:25.599
MATT: Grappling hook is two gold and the rope--
you want silk or hempen?

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:27.246
LAURA: (whispering) The cheaper one.

00:43:27.246 --> 00:43:28.850
MATT: That would be hempen, so that's one gold.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.538
SAM: You're probably more familiar with silk
bindings.

00:43:31.538 --> 00:43:33.513
MATT: So three gold for a single grappling rope
and rope.

00:43:33.513 --> 00:43:34.423
LAURA: That I use for different things.

00:43:34.423 --> 00:43:34.987
SAM: Got it.

00:43:34.987 --> 00:43:36.034
LAURA: I don't use them at all.

00:43:36.034 --> 00:43:39.634
MATT: So mark down that you have a grappling hook
and 50 feet of hempen rope.

00:43:39.634 --> 00:43:40.328
LAURA: Okay.

00:43:40.328 --> 00:43:43.926
MATT: All right. As you guys are accomplishing
that, the rest of you--

00:43:43.926 --> 00:43:45.260
LAURA: I'll get rid of-- I'll pay for it.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.243
MARISHA: All right.

00:43:46.243 --> 00:43:48.027
MATT: The rest of you, what are you doing?

00:43:48.027 --> 00:43:53.431
LIAM: I don't think we want the group to be too
big. Let these two handle this Ren and you and I

00:43:53.431 --> 00:43:55.225
will wait at the Leaky Tap and lay low.

00:43:55.225 --> 00:43:57.802
SAM: You want to let them go off on their own?

00:43:57.802 --> 00:43:59.970
LIAM: We don't want to create-- why do we want a
group--

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:03.344
TRAVIS: You've never heard of safety in numbers
and all that shit?

00:44:03.344 --> 00:44:05.915
SAM: They have to break in somewhere, they're going
to be--

00:44:05.915 --> 00:44:08.990
TRAVIS: Yeah man. I just figured you'd be a part
of this.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:14.109
SAM: I mean, I'm with you Caleb. If you don't want
to go then let's go back to the Leaky Tap.

00:44:14.213 --> 00:44:18.502
LIAM: No, we're going to break into houses
together. Of course I'm willing to do this. I just

00:44:18.502 --> 00:44:20.980
feel like for this-- what are you planning to do?

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:26.763
TRAVIS: Just some simple reconnaissance. See if we
can see Ren, maybe have a conversation with him.

00:44:26.763 --> 00:44:30.010
If he's not a total prick, I don't know, maybe
he's got some of his dad's handwriting.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:30.616
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

00:44:31.236 --> 00:44:32.800
SAM: We don't have to go, I don't care.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.363
LIAM: No it's fine.

00:44:33.363 --> 00:44:34.483
SAM: It sounds scary to me.

00:44:34.483 --> 00:44:37.679
LIAM: No I-- my head is not in the game. We'll go
along.

00:44:38.469 --> 00:44:43.248
TRAVIS: Great, we're going to head towards the
Apple Tree Tuneship? What did I write here?

00:44:43.248 --> 00:44:45.407
MATT: (laughs) The Tutoring Village.

00:44:45.407 --> 00:44:45.809
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:44:47.489 --> 00:44:48.539
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:44:48.539 --> 00:44:55.321
TRAVIS: Oh god. Nine, twelve.

00:44:55.321 --> 00:44:58.857
MATT: Twelve, okay. It takes you a little while to
get there. You haven't actually been to the Tutor

00:44:58.857 --> 00:44:59.759
Village before.

00:44:59.759 --> 00:45:00.177
TRAVIS: 13.

00:45:01.726 --> 00:45:06.053
MATT: Okay, same difference. So you manage,
through asking questions and finding your way

00:45:06.055 --> 00:45:12.163
around, you manage to get to the Tutor Village
right around sunset. You do see, about one block

00:45:12.163 --> 00:45:17.460
over, the large, white-peach building that you had
previously been told by Dolan. You see the sign

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:22.414
up; it's called the Guided Hand Infirmary. It's
one story, but it stretches wide towards the back.

00:45:22.414 --> 00:45:24.089
It's like a large shotgun building.

00:45:24.089 --> 00:45:25.657
TRAVIS: Guided Hand Infirmary?

00:45:25.657 --> 00:45:31.285
MATT: The Guided Hand Infirmary. You can see light
from the interior. There are two windows at the

00:45:31.285 --> 00:45:35.099
front, and a row of windows as it continues down
the back of the alley. The alley, you can see,

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:40.572
actually lights up, because the bright interior
warm light reflecting off of the buildings on the

00:45:40.572 --> 00:45:45.858
opposite side, down the alley on each parallel end
of it. The building itself seems fairly well made,

00:45:45.858 --> 00:45:53.767
there's elements of a plaster material put against
the wood to make it seem a little less cracked and

00:45:53.767 --> 00:45:58.140
broken on the vicinity around it. It looks like a
little more money went into this complex than a

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.765
lot of the surrounding buildings.

00:45:59.765 --> 00:46:05.840
TRAVIS: Right. He's a physician. Well, before we
put a personal touch on it, do you people with

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.442
sneaky abilities want to see what you can see in
the windows?

00:46:12.222 --> 00:46:15.121
LIAM: Yeah, well, we could send Frumpkin to have a
look around.

00:46:15.711 --> 00:46:16.916
SAM: That's a good idea.

00:46:18.476 --> 00:46:23.470
LIAM: I send Frumpkin. He will run around the
entire building, if he's able. He's also able to

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:28.858
climb things, so I will get him up on top of
window sills, if he can, to take a look inside.

00:46:29.708 --> 00:46:34.049
MATT: As Frumpkin curls up and jumps onto the
windowsill, and you glance through the vision of

00:46:34.389 --> 00:46:39.874
your familiar. The first window you come across,
inside, it's a simple room, it’s painted a similar

00:46:39.874 --> 00:46:47.821
white, peach color. There's a single bed, maybe
twin size, with a single sheet. You see an

00:46:47.821 --> 00:46:57.185
individual who is currently lying on it, with not
quite Caleb dirty clothes, but not an

00:46:57.185 --> 00:47:03.855
upperclassman by any means. Upperclassman? Not
what I was going for, that's fine.

00:47:04.475 --> 00:47:05.601
TRAVIS: Seniors '99!

00:47:05.601 --> 00:47:06.719
(laughter)

00:47:06.719 --> 00:47:16.984
MATT: Wooo! Sydney football rules. Weird. But, you
do see this individual is currently has a full arm

00:47:16.984 --> 00:47:23.887
bandaged, with blood soaked and dried on parts of
it, and they are currently asleep, and the door is

00:47:23.887 --> 00:47:28.348
closed. There is a lantern inside that is set to
keep the room warm.

00:47:28.348 --> 00:47:33.724
LIAM: Is there the ability for Frumpkin to move
around to the exact opposite side of this building?

00:47:33.733 --> 00:47:36.370
MATT: Yeah, have him move around, go around the
front.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:39.006
LIAM: Yeah, he will jump up to any windowsill on
the back of the house as well.

00:47:40.446 --> 00:47:44.360
MATT: As Frumpkin keeps watch on each of these,
each chamber seems to either be empty or there's

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:50.446
somebody in some state of either rest, or waiting.
You see one person, a younger girl maybe fifteen

00:47:50.446 --> 00:47:55.130
or sixteen years old, who is waiting on the edge
of a bed, sitting quietly in a room by herself.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:48:01.112
Glancing around, she looks over and sees Frumpkin,
and goes, "Kitty!" and makes the hand motion to

00:48:01.112 --> 00:48:07.008
try and pet-- You go around the back door and you
can see one room has two beds that currently have

00:48:07.008 --> 00:48:12.978
two individuals that are coughing heavily. They're
sick with something pretty bad, and there is a

00:48:12.978 --> 00:48:16.973
person inside that is dressed in a white robe that
is in the process of bringing them both broth, but

00:48:16.973 --> 00:48:21.135
they have a mask over their face, a piece of cloth
tied behind, and it looks like they're treating

00:48:21.135 --> 00:48:26.009
some diseased patients. This is, for all intents
and purposes, an infirmary.

00:48:26.009 --> 00:48:28.415
LIAM: Yeah, did you say this was a one story
building?

00:48:28.415 --> 00:48:32.547
MATT: It's a one story building, but it's quite
long. It goes back quite a bit. Other buildings

00:48:32.547 --> 00:48:39.195
are spotty and build the space around the outside
of this block, whereas this infirmary stretches

00:48:39.195 --> 00:48:40.277
the entire length of the block.

00:48:40.277 --> 00:48:44.532
LIAM: Five to ten minutes of hopping from ground
to window a bunch of times, all I find are patient

00:48:44.532 --> 00:48:47.566
rooms. No sort of office or anything else?

00:48:47.566 --> 00:48:51.260
MATT: Correct, it looks like all-- It looks like
it's built so that all the rooms that have

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.602
sunlight are the rooms where the patients would
stay. Anything important would be kept in the

00:48:54.602 --> 00:48:55.474
interior of the building.

00:48:55.474 --> 00:48:57.625
LIAM: One last thing, how high is the roof?

00:48:57.625 --> 00:49:01.021
MATT: The roof is about, I'd say, 12 feet up.

00:49:04.461 --> 00:49:10.185
LIAM: Fjord, come here. Scooch down for a second,
and I jump up onto-- I've taken my vision back-- I

00:49:10.185 --> 00:49:12.010
jump up onto his back. Now, stand up!

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.756
TRAVIS: 11 strength. Okay… Oof!

00:49:13.756 --> 00:49:20.528
LIAM: Okay. I snap at Frumpkin, and he vanishes,
and I reach out, and Frumpkin appears. I am now

00:49:20.528 --> 00:49:23.909
within ten feet, I would assume, of the top of the
building, so Frumpkin is on the roof.

00:49:23.909 --> 00:49:28.380
(teleportation noise) I want to send him to look--
Then I hop down off of Ford and put my hand and

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:34.299
steady myself on Fjord and have Frumpkin look for
any holes in the roof, or if there's a skylight,

00:49:34.299 --> 00:49:36.247
or anything. Probably not, but it's worth a try.

00:49:36.247 --> 00:49:42.259
MATT: As you're focusing, Fjord, you notice a small
child, maybe five or six years old, this scruffy

00:49:42.339 --> 00:49:46.792
reddish hair and a dirty smashed face, walks up
and goes, "What happened to the kitty?"

00:49:47.222 --> 00:49:54.143
TRAVIS: Oh, you know, it ran up on the roof. We
were trying to chase her down. You want to see if

00:49:54.143 --> 00:49:55.369
maybe she ran around the corner?

00:49:55.369 --> 00:49:57.335
MATT: "I was going up to pet it, and it went
away!"

00:49:57.335 --> 00:49:59.508
TRAVIS: Yeah. They're tricksy like that.

00:49:59.508 --> 00:50:01.286
MARISHA: Second time your cat just vanished.

00:50:03.746 --> 00:50:06.127
TRAVIS: Tell you what, if I see it, I'll call out.
What's your name?

00:50:06.477 --> 00:50:07.739
MATT: "Oh, I'm Simon."

00:50:07.739 --> 00:50:09.379
TRAVIS: Simon, okay.

00:50:09.379 --> 00:50:10.080
MARISHA: Simon!

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:10.639
SAM: We found him.

00:50:12.189 --> 00:50:13.528
LAURA: Simon became a real boy.

00:50:13.528 --> 00:50:14.718
MATT: He's a real boy.

00:50:14.718 --> 00:50:16.215
(laughter)

00:50:16.215 --> 00:50:18.965
TRAVIS: Simon, I'll call out if I see him. Why
don't you see, if you run the other way, see if

00:50:18.965 --> 00:50:19.751
you can find him.

00:50:19.751 --> 00:50:23.653
MATT: "Okay." He runs around the other side of the
building. Frumpkin is on top. And, looking at the

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:27.432
top, the front of it looks really nice. The top,
which nobody sees, doesn't look that great. It's a

00:50:27.432 --> 00:50:32.482
pretty shoddy, wooden slats over wooden slats,
across the entirety of the roof complex. You can

00:50:32.482 --> 00:50:36.389
see one small trap door, about the center of it,
that is currently closed.

00:50:39.749 --> 00:50:42.273
LIAM: Okay, I call him back.

00:50:42.733 --> 00:50:43.558
MATT: (Meowing)

00:50:43.978 --> 00:50:46.467
LIAM: Then I (snaps fingers). And then he's on my
shoulder.

00:50:47.247 --> 00:50:52.501
MATT: At which point, you hear a kid go, "Whoa!"
Simon is now on the side, staring at this

00:50:52.501 --> 00:50:54.031
disappearing and reappearing cat.

00:50:54.721 --> 00:51:02.772
LIAM: Yeah, cats are the best. I don't know,
there's a trap door up there, but, I mean, we're

00:51:02.772 --> 00:51:03.688
not going in.

00:51:03.688 --> 00:51:08.704
SAM: Go. Go away! Go. Go away! Shoo! Go away!

00:51:08.704 --> 00:51:10.819
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:51:10.819 --> 00:51:11.730
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh my god.

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:12.579
SAM: 14.

00:51:12.579 --> 00:51:14.289
MATT: 14. (screaming) and he runs.

00:51:15.209 --> 00:51:16.033
SAM: Oh, sorry.

00:51:16.033 --> 00:51:21.083
LIAM: Well done there, yeah. What do we want to
do? This place is full of sick people.

00:51:21.083 --> 00:51:25.715
TRAVIS: Right. Unless Ren is actually on the
inside. If they had an office, maybe we could

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:26.481
rifle through some--

00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:31.129
LIAM: Yeah. And if we're going in, what do we do?
We could have one of us be ill perhaps.

00:51:31.129 --> 00:51:34.978
TRAVIS: Yeah. Or just ill on the front doorstep
and keep them occupied.

00:51:34.978 --> 00:51:35.482
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:37.502 --> 00:51:41.432
TRAVIS: Yeah. I could, you know, kick the shit out
of Nott in the face, and then be like (yelling).

00:51:41.432 --> 00:51:45.355
SAM: I mean, we've got Mollymauk with us. Why
don't you just do the same thing to him?

00:51:46.755 --> 00:51:49.260
TRAVIS: I could kick the shit out of Nott in the
face, and then like--

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:57.274
SAM: I don't appreciate this. At all. I feel like
I'm being singled out because I'm a woman.

00:51:57.274 --> 00:51:59.690
(laughter)

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:03.571
LIAM: A better idea, perhaps, is for one of--
You're able to disguise yourself, right?

00:52:04.511 --> 00:52:05.540
TALIESIN: To a point.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.196
LIAM: There's three of us, that we can all
disguise ourselves. I can make myself look like

00:52:09.196 --> 00:52:10.061
like a sick person.

00:52:10.061 --> 00:52:15.081
TRAVIS: Although, he's a physician. So he might
try to, you know, check. And I think, up to touch,

00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:16.187
it falls apart.

00:52:16.187 --> 00:52:20.437
LIAM: Well, you can make yourself look like you,
but with not green skin.

00:52:20.869 --> 00:52:24.664
TALIESIN: It's standard carny practice to be able
to fake boils and stuff with a disguise kit to

00:52:24.664 --> 00:52:26.551
leper up a bit?

00:52:26.551 --> 00:52:33.249
MATT: It would take you about an hour or so to do
so. To a studied physician, probably not going to

00:52:33.249 --> 00:52:33.814
hold up.

00:52:33.814 --> 00:52:34.461
TALIESIN: Sure.

00:52:34.461 --> 00:52:37.071
MATT: You can certainly try. Depending upon how
high you roll.

00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.242
TALIESIN: Could fake some sick on people.

00:52:39.242 --> 00:52:44.480
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, I could mimic whatever you
have, and try to stay at arm's length.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.428
TALIESIN: You can just drag me in.

00:52:46.428 --> 00:52:48.904
TRAVIS: I like it. Yep.

00:52:48.904 --> 00:52:50.219
TALIESIN: I can make a scene.

00:52:50.219 --> 00:52:54.920
TRAVIS: Yep. I like that. Then you two try to get
into the office somehow?

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.189
SAM: If there is an office.

00:52:56.189 --> 00:52:59.052
TRAVIS: I'm assuming there is. It's a doctor's
office, right?

00:52:59.052 --> 00:53:03.111
LIAM: There is some sort of trapdoor in the center
of that building that I don't think is mirrored by

00:53:03.111 --> 00:53:07.683
any of the rooms that I was able to see on the
outside of the building. So it's like a donut with

00:53:07.683 --> 00:53:10.873
a hole in the middle, is where, maybe, what you're
looking for.

00:53:12.693 --> 00:53:16.346
TRAVIS: I think that makes sense. We'll cause a
ruckus, see what you can find.

00:53:16.346 --> 00:53:18.039
LIAM: Yeah. Ruckus, you and I go in.

00:53:18.039 --> 00:53:18.884
SAM: Okay.

00:53:20.734 --> 00:53:26.400
TALIESIN: Have we talked about the other house
yet? Because the distraction was obvious.

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:28.006
TRAVIS: Is it?

00:53:28.006 --> 00:53:31.733
TALIESIN and MARISHA: What kind of dog was it?

00:53:31.733 --> 00:53:32.770
TRAVIS: Well, they're not here.

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:33.713
TALIESIN: Was it a guard dog?

00:53:33.713 --> 00:53:36.498
TALIESIN: They haven't gotten back yet. Nevermind,
all right, I'm jumping ahead.

00:53:36.498 --> 00:53:38.354
TRAVIS: It was a Chihuahua on a chain.

00:53:38.354 --> 00:53:38.786
TALIESIN: We’re in!

00:53:38.786 --> 00:53:41.855
TRAVIS: Fierce as shit. Spiked collar, tongue
out--

00:53:41.855 --> 00:53:42.948
TALIESIN: We're going to need a bigger boat.

00:53:42.948 --> 00:53:43.878
MARISHA: Its name was Princess.

00:53:44.228 --> 00:53:48.308
CALEB: We're going to walk right in. These two are
going to create such a fuss.

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:55.258
TRAVIS: How long do you need to make
your face all lepered up?

00:53:56.498 --> 00:53:57.406
TALIESIN: About an hour?

00:53:58.507 --> 00:53:59.682
MATT: About an hour.

00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:02.179
TALIESIN: And who said I was going to do my face?

00:54:02.179 --> 00:54:04.423
LIAM: Couldn't you maybe act like--

00:54:05.696 --> 00:54:08.230
TALIESIN: We don't want them to look at it too
closely.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:09.733
SAM: Look like you're just-- Cough and stuff?

00:54:09.733 --> 00:54:10.859
LIAM: Could you be a sick tiefling?

00:54:10.859 --> 00:54:13.421
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to do that, too. I've got
a plan.

00:54:13.421 --> 00:54:15.619
MATT: You’re going to spend time and apply.

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:22.087
SAM: Oh, I've got it, I've got it. Faster. What if
Caleb burns all of your clothing and you go in as

00:54:22.087 --> 00:54:23.027
a burn victim?

00:54:23.027 --> 00:54:24.563
TALIESIN: You're not going to touch my clothing.

00:54:24.563 --> 00:54:26.764
CALEB: That's not, we’re not doing that.

00:54:26.764 --> 00:54:33.708
TALIESIN: No, we're not setting fire to my
clothing. I'm going to mess up my junk what fierce.

00:54:34.218 --> 00:54:35.068
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:54:36.218 --> 00:54:36.709
LAURA: Gross.

00:54:36.709 --> 00:54:37.355
MATT: In the street?

00:54:37.355 --> 00:54:42.905
TALIESIN: No, back at the-- do we have a place
where I can work, or am I going back to the Leaky

00:54:42.905 --> 00:54:44.379
Tap? Or is that too far away?

00:54:44.379 --> 00:54:48.386
MATT: That's up to you, you can try and duck into
a shady corner. And spend an hour.

00:54:48.386 --> 00:54:49.710
LAURA: Spend an hour painting your dick?

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:52.655
TALIESIN: An hour painting my dick? No, I'm going
to need some privacy for that.

00:54:52.655 --> 00:54:54.360
(laughter)

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.713
TALIESIN: I'm also going to need to order some
breakfast food. Something eggy.

00:54:57.713 --> 00:54:58.391
LAURA: Ugh.

00:54:58.391 --> 00:55:02.951
TRAVIS: For fuck's sake, Jesus. Really?

00:55:02.951 --> 00:55:03.490
TALIESIN: Really.

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:04.590
TRAVIS: Okay. All right.

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:07.437
TALIESIN: I thought you wanted a distraction!

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:13.835
TRAVIS: I do! I'm all about this. Let's go find
breakfast. Jesus.

00:55:16.215 --> 00:55:20.549
LIAM: When we go in, we don't walk in just you and
me. We do Mother's Love.

00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:22.949
SAM: Yes. Yes. We do Mother's Love.

00:55:22.949 --> 00:55:23.658
LIAM: Just in case.

00:55:23.658 --> 00:55:24.514
SAM: Yes, good idea.

00:55:24.514 --> 00:55:28.086
TRAVIS: Can we find a tavern?

00:55:28.086 --> 00:55:32.181
TALIESIN: A Denny's, whatever. The worst pub
ever.

00:55:32.181 --> 00:55:38.942
MATT: You can get yourself some evening scrambled
eggs for five copper.

00:55:38.942 --> 00:55:41.045
TRAVIS: I think we need sunny-side up, don't we?

00:55:41.045 --> 00:55:43.636
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to scramble everything.
I'm going to get some beer. I'm going to get some

00:55:43.636 --> 00:55:46.207
mayo. I'm going to get a little bit of everything,
I'm going to put it in my--

00:55:48.487 --> 00:55:49.645
LAURA: In your butt.

00:55:49.645 --> 00:55:52.796
MATT: All right. If you're gathering all those
materials from a scattered meal--

00:55:52.796 --> 00:55:54.180
TALIESIN: A little bit of hot sauce.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:58.007
MATT: We'll put it at about eight copper for the
total.

00:55:58.007 --> 00:55:59.900
TRAVIS: I'll pay for it. Don't. It's on me.

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:05.756
TALIESIN: No problem. We're going to put it in
my-- I've got a little water sack. I'm going to

00:56:05.756 --> 00:56:07.849
mix it all up and put it in there and wait till
we're ready to go.

00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:17.488
MATT: Okay. I'm going to say for this, go ahead
and roll a d20. Add your proficiency bonus and

00:56:17.488 --> 00:56:19.890
intelligence modifier.

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:22.274
MARISHA: Come on, stage makeup class!

00:56:22.274 --> 00:56:24.274
TALIESIN: D20, proficiency bonus, intelligence
modifier?

00:56:24.274 --> 00:56:27.336
MATT: Yeah. Because this is about trying to come
up with an accurate means of looking like you've

00:56:27.336 --> 00:56:28.450
been infected with something.

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:34.493
TALIESIN: That's 11.

00:56:34.493 --> 00:56:39.862
MATT: 11. Okay. You take an hour and you're pretty
proud of it. You think it'll work fine.

00:56:39.862 --> 00:56:41.493
SAM: Did you add your intelligence bonus?

00:56:41.493 --> 00:56:43.261
TALIESIN: I have no intelligence bonus.

00:56:43.261 --> 00:56:44.154
SAM: Oh, great.

00:56:44.154 --> 00:56:46.731
TRAVIS: Do I dare ask what it looks like?

00:56:46.731 --> 00:56:47.900
TALIESIN: You can see.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.139
LIAM: Yeah, show us the goods. What did you do to
yourself? Oh!

00:56:50.139 --> 00:56:51.997
TRAVIS: Why would you even?

00:56:51.997 --> 00:56:54.163
TALIESIN: That's the brilliance, is no one's going
to look that closely.

00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:57.326
TRAVIS: That's in your brain forever.

00:56:59.226 --> 00:57:00.254
TALIESIN: Literally forever.

00:57:01.254 --> 00:57:01.958
MATT: For a month.

00:57:03.928 --> 00:57:05.596
MARISHA: This is going to be the weirdest fanart.

00:57:05.596 --> 00:57:08.324
TALIESIN: Shit! I didn't even think about that!
God damn it.

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:11.075
LIAM: I will have Jester sketch it out and we will
have it forever.

00:57:12.735 --> 00:57:15.787
TRAVIS: Are we ready to do this? Are you ready to
make a damn fool of yourself?

00:57:16.257 --> 00:57:18.366
TALIESIN: I'm always ready to make a damn fool of
myself.

00:57:18.366 --> 00:57:20.765
TRAVIS: All right. Let's go. We go up to the front
door. Where are y’all going?

00:57:22.455 --> 00:57:26.286
LIAM: We're going to hang back. Is there a nook or
an alley within view of this?

00:57:26.286 --> 00:57:31.713
MATT: There's alleys on each side, but they both
have windows that are lit, so you would be in one

00:57:31.713 --> 00:57:32.508
of those vicinities.

00:57:32.508 --> 00:57:33.769
LIAM: Can we go half a block away?

00:57:33.769 --> 00:57:35.837
MATT: You could. You would be at a distance
though.

00:57:35.837 --> 00:57:39.430
LIAM: Yeah, that's fine for the moment. For the
moment, yeah. Get ready, we're going to do

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:40.146
Mother's Love.

00:57:40.146 --> 00:57:41.972
SAM: How will we know when to go?

00:57:41.972 --> 00:57:43.615
LIAM: We're going to watch them at the door.

00:57:43.615 --> 00:57:48.176
MATT: All right. So the two of you enter. You go
through the front door. It's a double door. It

00:57:48.176 --> 00:57:55.568
pushes open. It doesn't appear to have resistance,
it's on a hinge. You push in, and at the front

00:57:55.568 --> 00:58:02.219
there's a clerk there, wearing the same white
robe: a middle-aged man, receding hairline, short

00:58:02.219 --> 00:58:08.987
hair, big bulbous red nose, some pock-marking on
his cheek. He looks up. "Can I help you?"

00:58:08.987 --> 00:58:12.811
TALIESIN: No, I'm fine. I'm perfectly, perfectly
fine. I don't need to do any of this.

00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:14.546
TRAVIS: (coughing) No, you need help. It's real
gross.

00:58:14.546 --> 00:58:15.240
TALIESIN: I'm fine!

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:19.372
MATT: He reaches down and pulls a cloth up and
puts it immediately over his face. "Okay, um-- "

00:58:19.372 --> 00:58:24.872
TALIESIN: No, I don't -- I was born in a place
like this. I don't want anything to -- I'm going

00:58:24.872 --> 00:58:30.169
to give myself a little (grunt). Sir, there's --
(vomit). I'm going to go for it right in his face.

00:58:31.229 --> 00:58:36.506
LIAM: The ruckus is audible all the way down the
block, so I turn myself into a half-orc woman and

00:58:36.506 --> 00:58:42.315
pick up Nott like my baby and put her head on my
shoulder and start walking towards the building.

00:58:42.315 --> 00:58:48.095
MATT: Okay. As you're doing that, I need you to
roll a deception check with advantage because

00:58:48.095 --> 00:58:48.827
you're helping.

00:58:51.487 --> 00:59:00.797
TALIESIN: Magnets, how the fuck do they work?
That's nice. 21.

00:59:00.797 --> 00:59:06.893
MATT: 21! As soon as you spray in the face, he's
like (sputtering). Takes the scarf off and

00:59:06.893 --> 00:59:12.710
(panting) "Sit down, please!" He points over to a
bench on the side.

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:16.945
TALIESIN: I'm going to start crawling along the
floor and i'm going to cut myself a little bit on

00:59:16.945 --> 00:59:21.761
my neck. Since I'm used to it, I don't mind a
little blood. I'm giving myself a good cut, maybe

00:59:21.761 --> 00:59:24.357
there'll be a little ice fleck. I don't know if I
want to activate that, if it'll work on my

00:59:24.357 --> 00:59:29.167
fingernails, but what the fuck. I'm going to start
crawling, leaving a trail of vomit into the next

00:59:29.167 --> 00:59:30.352
room, going, no! No!

00:59:30.352 --> 00:59:31.401
MATT: Take a point of damage.

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:32.185
TALIESIN: Yup.

00:59:32.715 --> 00:59:36.570
TRAVIS: I go the opposite direction he starts
walking. (hacking cough)

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:43.068
MATT: The clerk at this point goes, "Please! Stay
tight, I'm going to-- shit!" He leaves the room.

00:59:43.068 --> 00:59:44.696
SAM: Go, go, go, go!

00:59:44.696 --> 00:59:47.985
LIAM: We peer in the door. What is going on in
this room at this point?

00:59:47.985 --> 00:59:55.708
MATT: You walk in as you see there's a spray of
stuff across the clerk's counter. You see both

00:59:55.708 --> 00:59:59.677
Mollymauk and Fjord crawling in opposite
directions across the floor as you hear footsteps,

00:59:59.677 --> 01:00:01.927
and the clerk had just rushed out of the chamber
down the hallway.

01:00:01.927 --> 01:00:07.145
LIAM: We are going to go between them like Noah
through the water. Oh, that's the wrong -- Moses, yeah.

01:00:08.455 --> 01:00:10.484
SAM: Like Noah through the ark!

01:00:12.714 --> 01:00:14.515
LIAM: There's vomit and eggs everywhere!

01:00:14.515 --> 01:00:18.546
MATT: What you see now is there's two hallways.
There's one to each side as you enter. Where the

01:00:18.546 --> 01:00:22.761
clerk's desk was, it looks like there's all the
rooms you saw on the right side, all the rooms you

01:00:22.761 --> 01:00:26.217
saw on the left side, and there are chambers in
the center of the building with the two hallways

01:00:26.217 --> 01:00:30.379
that bisect the two areas. You can choose right or
left, it's up to you. The clerk went down the

01:00:30.379 --> 01:00:30.998
right side.

01:00:31.238 --> 01:00:33.655
LIAM: I will take the left one if the clerk went
down the right side.

01:00:33.655 --> 01:00:39.755
MATT: Okay. As you're rushing with Nott in your
arms, you head into the hallway on the left side

01:00:39.755 --> 01:00:44.082
and you glance and can immediately see another
person with a robe, who is holding a small satchel

01:00:44.082 --> 01:00:49.240
of some sort of greenish material. They walk and
see you. "Excuse me, can I help you?"

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.245
LIAM: (crying)

01:00:51.245 --> 01:00:57.812
SAM: (baby wails)

01:00:57.812 --> 01:00:59.078
MATT: Make a deception check, please.

01:00:59.078 --> 01:01:07.519
SAM: Oh, no, me? That's a negative one. (shriek)

01:01:09.473 --> 01:01:18.219
MATT: "What seems to be the problem?" He looks, as
opposed to being empathically interested in your

01:01:18.219 --> 01:01:23.136
well-being, is genuinely disturbed by the sound
the child is making, Rosemary's Baby style.

01:01:25.726 --> 01:01:29.994
LIAM: Frumpkin appears on the back of the guy's
neck and starts tearing in.

01:01:29.994 --> 01:01:34.541
SAM: Oh, God, you're using it to attack? You can
do that?

01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:36.731
MATT: Roll an attack for Frumpkin, please.

01:01:36.731 --> 01:01:40.605
TRAVIS: My allergies are going to be shit in about
five seconds. My worst nightmare.

01:01:40.605 --> 01:01:45.616
LIAM: Oh, my gosh, for a cat? I mean, it's a 13
plus I don't know what.

01:01:45.616 --> 01:01:48.404
MATT: That hits, he's wearing a robe. Go ahead and
roll.

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.266
LIAM: Starts clawing. One?

01:01:50.266 --> 01:01:55.665
MATT: We'll say it's one point of damage, is a
cat's scratch. As it's clawing, he's (screaming).

01:01:55.665 --> 01:02:00.728
He starts screaming and grabs Frumpkin on his back
and tries to pull him and throw him off. Frumpkin

01:02:00.728 --> 01:02:07.750
full-on spins, scatters, all claws and legs out,
lands on the ground. (Angry cat sound) Full

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:12.619
puff-up, tail and everything. At this point you
watch another doorway flip open, and you see a man

01:02:12.619 --> 01:02:19.360
come out with very short brown hair on the sides
with a pompadour in the front and a similar white

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:26.302
robe, but it looks like it's longer-sleeved with
more detail. He goes, "What is all this ruckus happening?"

01:02:26.303 --> 01:02:29.121
MARISHA: Ooh, I hate him. I hate him already.

01:02:30.761 --> 01:02:36.149
MATT: "What is a cat doing here? Get the cat!" He
watches as the clerk says, "I don't -- shoo! Shoo!

01:02:36.149 --> 01:02:38.774
Shoo!" He's trying to get Frumpkin to leave now.

01:02:38.774 --> 01:02:43.515
TALIESIN: Off in the distance you hear, You have
no legal authority over me! (vomit)

01:02:43.515 --> 01:02:47.091
TRAVIS: (hacking cough)

01:02:47.091 --> 01:02:51.315
MATT: There's now other workers of the infirmary
coming out of the rooms that are all starting to

01:02:51.315 --> 01:02:56.149
gather. The one who saw you in the hallway is now
coming towards you while shooing Frumpkin out. You

01:02:56.149 --> 01:03:04.140
watch the guy who had left the chamber head back
into the office and close it. People are starting

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.137
to scatter. You guys are waiting in the two rooms
now, you said? You found two separate rooms?

01:03:07.137 --> 01:03:08.350
TALIESIN: I'm just running the hall.

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:09.748
MATT: You're just running the hall?

01:03:09.748 --> 01:03:10.566
TALIESIN: I'm crawling in the hall.

01:03:10.566 --> 01:03:11.481
MATT: What are you doing?

01:03:11.481 --> 01:03:13.787
TRAVIS: I'm standing there like (hacking cough). I
think I shit my pants!

01:03:13.787 --> 01:03:17.048
MATT: So you're coughing loud in the room. You're
crawling in the hall. Behind them?

01:03:17.048 --> 01:03:21.483
LIAM: Is there enough chaos for us to step into
one of these open rooms and shut the door behind us?

01:03:21.986 --> 01:03:28.211
MATT: We'll find out in a second. Now we have you
spitting and freaking out. The two clerks that are

01:03:28.211 --> 01:03:32.569
trying to push Frumpkin out are trying to escort
you. They see you. They're like, “Sir? Sir?” They

01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:34.484
start grabbing your arms and lifting you up.

01:03:34.484 --> 01:03:38.100
TALIESIN: (vomit) I'm still bleeding from the
neck.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.622
MATT: They start dragging you into one of the
rooms on the side. They open one room and there's

01:03:41.622 --> 01:03:45.065
somebody in there already who was sleeping but is
starting to come to, going, "What's happening?"

01:03:45.065 --> 01:03:48.460
"Sorry!" They close the door, go to the next
chamber, and start dragging you into an empty room.

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.482
TALIESIN: I'm going to immediately -- I'm going to
go limp.

01:03:50.482 --> 01:03:51.236
MATT: Okay.

01:03:51.236 --> 01:03:53.570
TALIESIN: Then the minute the door's open, I'm
going to make a break for it.

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:56.410
MATT: All right. They open the door--

01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:56.660
TALIESIN: I'm out!

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.939
MATT: You bolt?

01:03:57.939 --> 01:04:00.380
TALIESIN: I'm going to bolt. Full speed.

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:03.890
MATT: Make an athletics check.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:07.465
TALIESIN: All right. Athletics or acrobatics?
Athletics?

01:04:07.465 --> 01:04:09.757
MATT: Actually, this would be your choice.

01:04:09.757 --> 01:04:13.841
TALIESIN: Oh, yay. That's nice. Nine?

01:04:14.481 --> 01:04:16.301
ALL: Nine!

01:04:17.481 --> 01:04:22.423
MATT: You try and pull away, but in the moment,
they're genuinely worried about your well-being.

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:27.726
They've probably had patients try and make big
physical actions while they're in their care, and

01:04:27.726 --> 01:04:28.583
they hold you back.

01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:34.317
TALIESIN: It's magic! I'm possessed! I turn to one
and go, (in a guttural voice) The power of Christ

01:04:34.317 --> 01:04:41.387
compels you! I'm going to use Devil's Tongue and
I'm going to do a couple points of damage to him.

01:04:41.387 --> 01:04:43.495
MATT: Devil's Tongue or Vicious Mockery?

01:04:43.495 --> 01:04:44.804
TALIESIN: Vicious Mockery.

01:04:46.234 --> 01:04:47.341
TRAVIS: Oh, lord. Oh no.

01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:48.829
TALIESIN: It's only a couple points.

01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:51.859
MATT: Okay. That's 11. What's your DC on it?

01:04:53.249 --> 01:04:58.657
TALIESIN: On Vicious Mockery? Where's my -- I'm
not used to magic. It's so weird.

01:04:58.657 --> 01:05:02.538
MARISHA: I'd like to say, I feel pretty good about
our casing mission.

01:05:02.538 --> 01:05:03.690
MATT: What's your charisma modifier?

01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:05.175
TALIESIN: Charisma modifier is zero.

01:05:08.265 --> 01:05:09.938
SAM: Your modifier's right there.

01:05:09.938 --> 01:05:12.148
TALIESIN: Is it? I'm blind. Where does it go?

01:05:12.148 --> 01:05:21.763
MATT: It's fine. They succeed. You shout this and
one of them (groan). They grab and throw you into

01:05:21.763 --> 01:05:28.166
the room. You (whoosh) into the chamber and they
close the door, pushing you inside of it.

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:30.090
TALIESIN: It would've been a plus three modifier,
sorry.

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:33.071
MATT: Well, what's the DC of the spell is what I'm
asking?

01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:35.307
TALIESIN: I'm trying to find that. I'm not used to
magic.

01:05:35.307 --> 01:05:36.065
MATT: That's okay.

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:36.914
TALIESIN: Yeah, never mind.

01:05:36.914 --> 01:05:43.538
MATT: It's fine. They shove you into the chamber.
They close the door. You land on the ground and

01:05:43.538 --> 01:05:45.155
you hear it lock behind you.

01:05:45.155 --> 01:05:45.939
TALIESIN: All right.

01:05:45.939 --> 01:05:51.393
MATT: You are now a dangerous patient who needs
other glancing. While that's happening and they're

01:05:51.393 --> 01:05:52.643
distracted by that, you guys--

01:05:52.643 --> 01:05:56.344
LIAM: Look for an empty room. Or is every room in
the house full?

01:05:57.484 --> 01:06:00.217
MATT: I'd say about half of them are full. You see
two chambers that are empty.

01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:01.858
LIAM: I go in and shut the door behind us.

01:06:01.858 --> 01:06:04.641
MATT: All right. You close the door. You guys both
make stealth checks real fast.

01:06:05.721 --> 01:06:06.717
LIAM: A one.

01:06:06.957 --> 01:06:07.581
SAM: 21.

01:06:08.491 --> 01:06:14.801
MATT: All right. You enter the room and close it.
What are you doing?

01:06:15.241 --> 01:06:17.995
SAM: What are we doing in here? We have to go back
to the office!

01:06:17.995 --> 01:06:19.971
LIAM: Yeah, but he's in the office.

01:06:19.971 --> 01:06:24.580
SAM: We could -- You're right. Maybe we should
just leave. Molly and Fjord will be fine, we'll

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.084
just leave.

01:06:26.244 --> 01:06:29.426
LIAM: We don't know. That's a no, we're working
together. We're trying to work together with

01:06:29.426 --> 01:06:34.040
people. No, we have to get all of us out of here,
which is more important than finding this asshole

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.872
in the building. What do we do, what do we do?

01:06:37.872 --> 01:06:47.173
SAM: We have some-- We could-- I'm looking. What
do we got? We could do Enemy of My Enemy?

01:06:49.753 --> 01:06:51.717
LIAM: That seems extreme at this moment.

01:06:52.497 --> 01:07:01.230
SAM: (stammering) You could set the place on fire.
You could-- I don't know what to do!

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:05.309
MATT: (knocking) "Hello? Is there somebody in
here?"

01:07:05.959 --> 01:07:06.604
SAM: Shh!

01:07:11.704 --> 01:07:15.597
MATT: The door opens and you see that there's a
clerk who had apparently heard the door close

01:07:15.597 --> 01:07:21.250
behind you as you had entered the room and is now
walking into this darkened chamber. As soon as the

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:24.328
door opens, you guys are on the opposite side of
the door. He walks over towards the lantern in the

01:07:24.328 --> 01:07:27.620
corner to light it, because the room is dark that
you're in. There's nobody in there at the moment.

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.653
He walks over.

01:07:29.123 --> 01:07:30.416
LIAM: Let's go. Out we go.

01:07:30.416 --> 01:07:32.939
SAM: Okay, let's go! We're going to run out the
door.

01:07:32.939 --> 01:07:39.933
MATT: "Oh, wait! Wait!" You guys bolt past into
the hallway. You guys dart out to the entrance and

01:07:39.933 --> 01:07:41.724
out into the night air.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.485
SAM: Wait, out of the hospital or just out of the
room?

01:07:43.485 --> 01:07:44.897
LIAM: I wasn't saying that, but I don't mind.

01:07:44.897 --> 01:07:45.922
SAM: Just out of the room.

01:07:45.922 --> 01:07:48.713
MATT: Oh, just out of the room. You guys are out
of the room and the person sees you.

01:07:48.713 --> 01:07:54.869
LIAM: No, but we'll go down the hall towards the
front of the building to look for, I would assume,

01:07:54.869 --> 01:07:55.687
Fjord and Molly at this point.

01:07:55.687 --> 01:07:59.420
MATT: Well, you guys find Fjord there, coughing
loudly, while you are currently locked in this room.

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:00.605
TALIESIN: I know. Is there a window?

01:08:00.605 --> 01:08:01.243
MATT: There is.

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:01.884
TALIESIN: In the door?

01:08:01.884 --> 01:08:06.077
MATT: Yeah. Well, no. There's a door, it's a
closed solid door, and there's a window looking outside.

01:08:06.077 --> 01:08:08.397
TALIESIN: (cackling) Are there bars on the
window?

01:08:09.737 --> 01:08:16.539
MATT: There's not. No. There is one cross bar that
is maintained, it's more to support the four panes

01:08:16.539 --> 01:08:19.441
of glass, but that's it.

01:08:19.441 --> 01:08:25.881
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to peek out the
door to see if anybody's coming for a minute.

01:08:26.406 --> 01:08:27.898
MATT: Peek out the door?

01:08:27.898 --> 01:08:29.112
TALIESIN: I mean the little door window.

01:08:29.112 --> 01:08:31.656
MATT: Sorry, there's no window in the door.

01:08:31.656 --> 01:08:37.599
TALIESIN: No window in the door and the door is
locked. Okay. I'm going to start gently meditating

01:08:37.599 --> 01:08:40.492
on breaking the window, or opening the window if
it'll open.

01:08:40.492 --> 01:08:41.648
MATT: Okay. While you're meditating on that--

01:08:41.648 --> 01:08:42.292
LIAM: Is Fjord alone in this room?

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:43.057
MATT: Fjord is alone in the room.

01:08:43.057 --> 01:08:44.354
LIAM: I turn and show him Nott.

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.781
SAM: We got to go!

01:08:46.781 --> 01:08:48.182
TRAVIS: Did you get anything?

01:08:48.182 --> 01:08:49.164
SAM: No.

01:08:49.164 --> 01:08:55.883
TRAVIS: Well don't give up! (cough) I walk out
towards them. Do you have a privy? I think I shat myself.

01:08:58.503 --> 01:09:02.526
MATT: There are two clerks now that were
originally fleeing to get help and have come back

01:09:02.526 --> 01:09:10.247
now with the gentleman with the short brown hair,
who's exited the opposite side of the chamber now.

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:17.100
"We've brought the doctor." He moves before the
doctor, who approaches. "All right, so you appear

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:17.817
to be sick."

01:09:17.817 --> 01:09:24.901
TRAVIS: Yeah. (cough) I have a terrible cough and
apparently my breakfast didn't agree with me and I

01:09:24.901 --> 01:09:28.017
coughed a little too much and felt a pack in my
pants.

01:09:28.017 --> 01:09:29.084
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:09:29.084 --> 01:09:31.374
SAM: Is this the doctor that we saw before?

01:09:31.374 --> 01:09:31.969
MATT: Yes.

01:09:33.459 --> 01:09:34.161
TRAVIS: 15. 16.

01:09:34.161 --> 01:09:44.208
MATT: 16? He goes, "All right. Please have a seat
in this chamber."

01:09:44.208 --> 01:09:49.102
TRAVIS: I think I got shit in my pants. Can I
visit the bathroom real quick? I don't want it

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:50.597
running down my thighs and stuff.

01:09:50.597 --> 01:09:53.549
MATT: "There's an outhouse about two blocks down
outside. Come back -- "

01:09:53.549 --> 01:09:55.506
TRAVIS: You don't have anything in the building?

01:09:55.506 --> 01:09:57.338
MATT: "Get in the room. We'll get you a pan."

01:09:58.458 --> 01:10:00.103
TRAVIS: All right. Yeah. I go in the room.

01:10:01.023 --> 01:10:05.460
MATT: You go in the room, and one of them pulls
out a metallic bedpan and sets it down on the side.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:08.576
TRAVIS: Can I have a little privacy while I check
my undercarriage?

01:10:08.576 --> 01:10:13.695
MATT: They close the door immediately and then
turn to you two: “We’ll get to him in a second.

01:10:13.695 --> 01:10:14.736
What’s your problem?”

01:10:15.766 --> 01:10:17.834
LIAM: (soft voice) Fever. She has a fever.

01:10:19.444 --> 01:10:23.901
MATT: “Let me see her.” He comes forward and puts
his hands out towards Nott.

01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:26.384
SAM: (hisses)

01:10:26.384 --> 01:10:31.239
MATT: Do you do that? Make an intimidation check
with advantage.

01:10:34.479 --> 01:10:43.261
SAM: Intimidation? Negative three?! How is that
possible? 13.

01:10:43.261 --> 01:10:51.095
MATT: 13. The physician goes (screams), falls
back. The other two clerks or physician helpers

01:10:51.095 --> 01:10:55.733
catch him: “Get it out! Get it out! Out! Shoo!”

01:10:55.733 --> 01:11:01.353
SAM: I’m going to scamper towards the office if I
can, as fast as I can.

01:11:01.353 --> 01:11:05.998
MATT: Make an acrobatics check to try and dodge
past their grasp as you begin to dart through their--

01:11:05.999 --> 01:11:11.172
SAM: Oh god. Nine? They got me. They got me,
guys.

01:11:11.172 --> 01:11:18.038
MATT: As you run, all of a sudden there’s a tug on
your cloak and the same younger physician who had

01:11:18.038 --> 01:11:25.243
told you to get out is clutching the back of your
cloak and lifts you up off the ground. “Well then,

01:11:25.243 --> 01:11:30.143
someone’s going to play nice with the
Crownsguard,” and turns and starts bringing you

01:11:30.143 --> 01:11:32.114
towards the exit. “You too, outside!”

01:11:32.714 --> 01:11:35.782
SAM: Oh no. This couldn’t have gone better.

01:11:37.222 --> 01:11:38.483
TRAVIS: Am I in the room by myself?

01:11:38.483 --> 01:11:39.149
MATT: Yes.

01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:44.304
TRAVIS: Can I cast Disguise Self and give myself
the same sort of clerk/orderly outfit as…

01:11:44.304 --> 01:11:45.110
MATT: Yeah, easily.

01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:49.395
TRAVIS: Maybe not looking exactly like one of
them, but like them in a uniform.

01:11:49.395 --> 01:11:49.799
MATT: Yeah.

01:11:49.799 --> 01:11:52.275
TRAVIS: Okay. Can I exit the room and come out
into the hall?

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:57.641
MATT: You exit out and the two other ones are
looking a bit confused. He’s currently dragging

01:11:57.641 --> 01:12:01.740
Nott who’s flailing on the edge of the cloak,
dangling, out into the main area.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:06.395
TRAVIS: Get him out of here. I walk past them,
towards the office where the doctor is.

01:12:06.395 --> 01:12:14.739
MATT: Okay. He goes and throws you out onto the
street. Pushes you out, Caleb, and goes “Guard!”

01:12:14.739 --> 01:12:19.880
and begins pointing loudly over there, down in the
direction of where you tumbled and landed on the ground.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.664
LIAM: Wait, so who’s where outside?

01:12:21.664 --> 01:12:26.244
MATT: You guys got shoved out into the front of
the facility. Nott got tossed, landed, and

01:12:26.244 --> 01:12:29.528
stumbled a few feet, and they’re now shouting for
the guard and pointing at Nott.

01:12:29.528 --> 01:12:30.815
LIAM: Pointing at us? Okay.

01:12:30.815 --> 01:12:32.796
SAM: Enemy of My Enemy now?

01:12:32.796 --> 01:12:38.878
LIAM: (groans) That still seems extreme. We should
just book it.

01:12:38.878 --> 01:12:46.379
SAM: Are you fast? All right, fine. I’m not
leaving you. I’m much faster than you.

01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:49.242
MATT: You guys start bolting?

01:12:49.242 --> 01:12:50.607
SAM: We’re going to start to run.

01:12:50.607 --> 01:12:54.729
MATT: As you guys run, they don’t give chase
because it’s not their job to do so, but they

01:12:54.729 --> 01:12:59.700
start shouting and shouting. I want you both to
roll stealth checks to try and see if you can

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:03.059
avoid the sight of the Crownsguard that are in the
process of responding to the shout.

01:13:03.059 --> 01:13:03.870
SAM: 15 from me.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.998
LIAM: Only a ten for me.

01:13:05.998 --> 01:13:15.447
MATT: Okay. As you guys dart into the nearby
shadows, plugging down a few alleyways, you hear

01:13:15.447 --> 01:13:21.318
some voices in the distance, some conversations,
some shouting, and then some footfalls that get

01:13:21.318 --> 01:13:27.750
loud... and then get a little softer, and
eventually a little softer and fade off. You just

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.328
barely scraped by on that one.

01:13:29.328 --> 01:13:31.503
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh my god.

01:13:31.503 --> 01:13:35.466
MATT: You, however, darted off towards the open
office and as soon as you glance in there, you can

01:13:35.466 --> 01:13:42.025
see there is a desk set up, there is a chair,
there are a number of large books and stacks of

01:13:42.025 --> 01:13:49.445
parchment. It looks like there is a whole rack up
top with various medicinal herbs and salves that

01:13:49.445 --> 01:13:55.510
are categorized into small makeshift cubbies. This
is where a lot of the treatment seems to be mustered.

01:13:55.513 --> 01:14:00.296
TRAVIS: Can I turn, and as I start to close the
door behind me, can I look down the hallway and

01:14:00.408 --> 01:14:03.466
see if anybody is walking towards me in the
hallway. Is it relatively clear?

01:14:03.466 --> 01:14:07.698
MATT: Well, it’s clear for the moment, but the man
who was just in this office just finished

01:14:07.698 --> 01:14:11.828
throwing Nott outside and is in the process of
talking with the Crownsguard. You don’t know how

01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:13.022
long you have until he returns.

01:14:13.022 --> 01:14:19.463
TRAVIS: Can I grab a handful of papers off the
desk and put them under my shirt and start walking out?

01:14:20.253 --> 01:14:24.929
MATT: You palm a bunch and throw it in there, all
right. You exit, just as you see them returning to

01:14:24.929 --> 01:14:31.412
the hallway with the physician straightening his
outfit, making his way in your direction. Doesn’t

01:14:31.412 --> 01:14:34.790
even make eye contact with you, just brushes by
and shoulder-checks you, which is hilarious

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:39.030
because the size of your visual is much smaller,
so it’s like (impact) “Watch it!” and was two

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:43.743
inches away, but doesn’t seem to notice in the
moment that he actually did so. Makes his way into

01:14:43.743 --> 01:14:48.901
the office, you hear the door close behind you,
and the two other clerks frustratingly start

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:52.487
scattering and making their way to the other
chambers. One of them is talking to the other

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:56.636
about, “I don’t know what happened. He went crazy
and started spitting and was bleeding everywhere,”

01:14:56.636 --> 01:14:59.855
and they’re both making their way to the door
where Molly is in.

01:15:01.435 --> 01:15:06.650
TRAVIS: That was very unruly; I need to excuse
myself for a moment. I’ll head out of the infirmary.

01:15:06.656 --> 01:15:10.718
MATT: Okay. You head back out onto the street. You
are in that chamber for a while. Are you doing anything?

01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:13.486
TALIESIN: How long has it been?

01:15:13.486 --> 01:15:16.263
TRAVIS: I’m heading out of the infirmary and I’m
going to start wrapping around the building

01:15:16.263 --> 01:15:18.802
towards the side of the building that he was in.

01:15:18.802 --> 01:15:21.042
TALIESIN: I’m seeing how-- is it possible to open
the window?

01:15:22.202 --> 01:15:23.583
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:30.824
TALIESIN: God, all these numbers I used to be good
at, but I’m not good at anymore. Ten.

01:15:30.824 --> 01:15:38.959
MATT: Ten. Nothing easily does so. You can try and
pry one of the panes out, but there’s a decent

01:15:38.959 --> 01:15:40.991
chance it might break in the process if you’re not
careful.

01:15:40.991 --> 01:15:41.562
TALIESIN: That’s fine.

01:15:41.562 --> 01:15:45.847
MATT: You’re going to try? You take one of your
blades and you wedge it up underneath where the

01:15:45.847 --> 01:15:51.752
metal bar is, it’s holding the pane in place to
see if you can wedge it out. Go ahead and make a

01:15:51.752 --> 01:15:53.274
straight dexterity check.

01:15:55.244 --> 01:15:56.804
TALIESIN: Nope. One.

01:15:56.804 --> 01:16:01.955
MATT: It shatters and breaks on both sides of the
window. You watch as the window shatters outward--

01:16:01.955 --> 01:16:03.110
TALIESIN: I’m going to jump out of it.

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.053
MATT: The pane itself is about that big, so you’re
going to take more of the window with you to do it.

01:16:07.053 --> 01:16:08.420
TALIESIN: Yeah, that’s okay.

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:14.254
MATT: All right! You shoulder-roll-leap through,
shattering the window out of the infirmary,

01:16:14.254 --> 01:16:18.728
rolling into the alley. You see this happen as
Molly is a chaotic spill of glass shards and

01:16:18.728 --> 01:16:20.445
purple skin.

01:16:20.705 --> 01:16:21.384
TRAVIS: Run!

01:16:23.514 --> 01:16:27.469
MATT: You guys bolt. At this point, as you head
back, you’ve now seen the guards that have just

01:16:27.469 --> 01:16:34.169
run off to go after Nott hear the shatter and turn
around to begin, some of them, to double back to

01:16:34.169 --> 01:16:35.949
where the sound of the glass breaking came from.

01:16:35.949 --> 01:16:40.257
TRAVIS: Can I point off in a different direction
than Molly’s running, since I look like a hospital

01:16:40.257 --> 01:16:41.011
clerk nurse?

01:16:41.431 --> 01:16:42.298
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:16:42.298 --> 01:16:44.747
TALIESIN: Carry me. I’m going to jump into your
arms while you do that.

01:16:44.747 --> 01:16:46.850
LAURA: No, no, he’s pointing the other direction!

01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:47.638
MATT: It’s too late!

01:16:49.508 --> 01:16:52.549
TALIESIN: Wait, no, I’m trying to understand the
scene here. I thought they were looking at him.

01:16:53.059 --> 01:16:53.713
MATT: They are.

01:16:53.713 --> 01:16:55.431
LAURA: They’re looking at him, but you were
running away.

01:16:55.431 --> 01:16:57.549
TALIESIN: Well, if I’m already-- because I didn’t
know if I was just standing--

01:16:57.549 --> 01:16:58.569
MATT: Okay.

01:16:58.569 --> 01:16:59.315
TRAVIS: 15.

01:17:00.705 --> 01:17:05.674
MATT: 15. The guards approach and they both look
antsy, but they see you pointing away, and they

01:17:05.674 --> 01:17:11.340
both head in the direction that you were heading
them off towards, as Molly’s about to leap into

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:11.790
your arms.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.163
TALIESIN: I was already-- towards…

01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:24.214
MATT: You guys have managed to find yourselves
back into the chaotic evening of the streets of Zadash.

01:17:24.216 --> 01:17:28.388
LIAM: I think I was imagining a small mom-and-pop
place with two physicians, but like 50 people in

01:17:28.388 --> 01:17:29.755
white coats came out--

01:17:30.369 --> 01:17:31.645
MATT: It’s like six.

01:17:33.265 --> 01:17:35.716
LIAM: I think it was more like 72, Matt, let’s be
honest.

01:17:35.716 --> 01:17:39.079
MARISHA: In the meantime, me and Jester are like:
What’s taking them so long?

01:17:39.079 --> 01:17:41.942
LIAM: Oh, that only took five minutes to go that
bad.

01:17:41.942 --> 01:17:44.478
MARISHA: He took an hour to cosplay his dick!

01:17:47.478 --> 01:17:49.710
MATT: Which is still there, by the way!

01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:52.186
TALIESIN: I know, I’m going to save that for
later.

01:17:52.186 --> 01:17:56.000
TRAVIS: As we’re walking back, can I start looking
over the papers, looking for some sort of

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.278
signature that says Richter or Prucine or
anything?

01:18:00.278 --> 01:18:03.756
MATT: Yeah. As you guys make your way back to the
Leaky Tap to eventually meet up, going through the

01:18:03.756 --> 01:18:07.736
paperwork, unfortunately, none of them have
anything that signifies the High-Richter. They all

01:18:07.736 --> 01:18:15.271
seem to be various quick notes on bones breaks and
resets, on various illnesses that have come

01:18:15.271 --> 01:18:19.050
through and treatments that have been applied,
keeping tabs on return visits. It’s all various

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:20.036
notes of--

01:18:20.496 --> 01:18:22.463
SAM: Anything from his dad?

01:18:23.193 --> 01:18:25.831
MATT: Nothing from Lord Sutan, unfortunately.

01:18:25.831 --> 01:18:27.906
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was just on top of the desk.

01:18:28.497 --> 01:18:31.028
MATT: If you had possibly searched a little
longer, you could have maybe found something, you

01:18:31.028 --> 01:18:34.499
think, but given the circumstances, it did not
occur.

01:18:35.719 --> 01:18:39.646
TRAVIS: I don’t really have anything to hold him.
Crown of Madness!

01:18:42.496 --> 01:18:45.567
MATT: So you didn’t find anything you wanted to,
and you probably definitely fucked up a few

01:18:45.567 --> 01:18:51.258
people’s recovery routine. But that’s fine. You
guys eventually find your way back to The Leaky

01:18:51.258 --> 01:18:59.633
Tap. Your monk and your cleric are waiting for
you, and you watch as these four individuals walk

01:18:59.633 --> 01:19:01.736
in looking a bit haggard.

01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:04.087
TRAVIS: Great success. Went off without a hitch.

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:07.040
MARISHA: Why are you covered in mayonnaise and
egg?

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:09.586
LAURA: Why do you smell like beer?

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:13.450
MARISHA: And hot sauce? Is that hot sauce?

01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:18.887
TALIESIN: That is, in fact, hot sauce. I’m going
to empty out my canteen into the fire.

01:19:21.447 --> 01:19:22.131
LAURA: Gross.

01:19:23.701 --> 01:19:25.053
TALIESIN: I was making a distraction.

01:19:25.463 --> 01:19:27.632
TRAVIS: We found Ren. We--

01:19:27.632 --> 01:19:31.622
SAM: He’s heavily guarded. There was no way to get
close enough.

01:19:31.622 --> 01:19:36.276
LAURA: Did you go in and say “Can I speak to Ren?”
and then somebody else go in his office while

01:19:36.276 --> 01:19:39.498
somebody was in the front asking to talk to Ren?

01:19:39.498 --> 01:19:44.194
TRAVIS: That’s actually exactly what happened, it
just didn’t go as well as you thought it might go.

01:19:44.194 --> 01:19:44.803
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:19:44.803 --> 01:19:47.148
TRAVIS: Great minds think alike, though, Jester.

01:19:47.148 --> 01:19:49.028
TALIESIN: Fools seldom differ.

01:19:50.988 --> 01:19:57.289
MARISHA: You guys look real defeated, over here.
You look <i>palpably</i> defeated.

01:19:57.289 --> 01:19:59.955
SAM: We almost had to kill an orderly.

01:19:59.955 --> 01:20:00.456
MARISHA: What?!

01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:04.309
SAM: It’s very embarrassing.

01:20:04.309 --> 01:20:05.873
LIAM: That’s true, it came very close.

01:20:05.873 --> 01:20:08.035
TRAVIS: How’d it go for you two?

01:20:08.035 --> 01:20:16.666
LAURA: Oh, well, we cased out his house. We found
a big tree that we can hop the fence with. Oh, and

01:20:16.666 --> 01:20:20.343
we bought this rope and this grapple so that we
can climb.

01:20:20.343 --> 01:20:22.192
LIAM: So you looked at the house and then you went
shopping?

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:24.914
LAURA: Well, so that we can break into the house,
yes.

01:20:24.914 --> 01:20:25.987
LIAM: Tight, that’s tight.

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.353
TALIESIN: I jumped through a window.

01:20:27.353 --> 01:20:28.806
MARISHA: You what?!

01:20:28.806 --> 01:20:30.712
TALIESIN: Full glass, it was great.

01:20:30.712 --> 01:20:32.913
LAURA: Is that what all of these things are?

01:20:32.913 --> 01:20:34.858
TALIESIN: Well, some of those are sequins, but
yes, essentially.

01:20:37.928 --> 01:20:38.796
MARISHA: All right.

01:20:40.476 --> 01:20:46.822
SAM: It was a good dry run for our real heist that
we’re going to be doing in a day. So we’re working

01:20:46.822 --> 01:20:47.878
out the kinks…

01:20:49.248 --> 01:20:50.529
TRAVIS: Not promising.

01:20:54.699 --> 01:20:56.992
TALIESIN: It’s not about the plan, it’s about the
desire to improvise.

01:20:56.992 --> 01:20:59.015
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on Molly.

01:20:59.015 --> 01:21:01.573
TALIESIN: Oh, yay. I had very little, so thank you
for that.

01:21:01.573 --> 01:21:07.715
MARISHA: You know this could lead back to make it
look suspicious if we go after Lord Sutan if his

01:21:07.715 --> 01:21:09.462
son was just broken into, right?

01:21:09.462 --> 01:21:14.115
SAM: Well, don’t worry about that because they
definitely saw our real faces.

01:21:14.845 --> 01:21:15.683
LIAM: Not my face.

01:21:16.943 --> 01:21:21.655
SAM: Oh yes, you’re right. They only saw my real
face, so maybe that’s okay.

01:21:22.235 --> 01:21:24.821
MARISHA: He’s going to know his medical notes are
missing, right?

01:21:25.451 --> 01:21:28.683
TRAVIS: It’s an infirmary. They got to see
terrible people in there all the time.

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:33.979
LIAM: Yeah, agreed. In hospitals, you see all
nature of people.

01:21:33.979 --> 01:21:37.757
MARISHA: All right, okay.

01:21:37.757 --> 01:21:41.926
LAURA: Yeah, nobody mentioned anything about
needing handwriting, right?

01:21:41.926 --> 01:21:43.133
SAM: No, no.

01:21:44.243 --> 01:21:45.750
LIAM: No, there was not a lot of--

01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:48.311
LAURA: No talk of his father at all, right--

01:21:48.311 --> 01:21:50.668
LIAM: There was not a lot of talking, in fact.

01:21:50.668 --> 01:21:54.105
TALIESIN: It was probably just an attempt to steal
medicinals.

01:21:55.255 --> 01:21:57.857
MARISHA: Sure, sure. All right.

01:21:59.227 --> 01:22:06.829
LAURA: Well, we have Ren’s handwriting. We could
potentially put a note in somebody’s house with

01:22:07.079 --> 01:22:12.768
his stuff, but I don’t know if that’s what the
plan is.

01:22:12.768 --> 01:22:20.872
MARISHA: Well, I mean, that works because as Dolan
said, these fancy people tend to get other people

01:22:20.872 --> 01:22:25.193
to write their mail and do their paperwork for
them, so…

01:22:25.193 --> 01:22:29.562
LIAM: Well, it could add credibility to the
tapestry that we’re trying to weave here. The goal

01:22:29.562 --> 01:22:33.303
is still to get into Sutan elder’s home and get
this seal.

01:22:33.303 --> 01:22:35.736
MARISHA: Yeah, that never changed.

01:22:35.736 --> 01:22:43.886
LIAM: Within the writings that we forge we could
include some by the junior Sutan, so that would

01:22:43.886 --> 01:22:45.356
add some credibility to what we’re doing.

01:22:46.226 --> 01:22:48.249
TRAVIS: Might get us in past that outer wall, at
least.

01:22:51.209 --> 01:22:55.381
LIAM: We still have to figure out what we are
going to-- if we are starting at Sutan’s house,

01:22:55.381 --> 01:23:01.149
then… We don’t have any writing of the
High-Richter’s; we are either trying to focus on

01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:07.721
finding that somehow or, going on what you were
discussing which is creating the appearance of an

01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:14.276
underling, or a for-hire of the High-Richter’s, or
some kind of code saying that they are

01:23:14.276 --> 01:23:19.286
communicating with Sutan elder on behalf of the
High-Richter, yeah?

01:23:20.486 --> 01:23:23.400
MARISHA: Nott, over here, knows a little bit of
Thieves’ Cant.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.600
SAM: Do you need me to write something?

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:28.399
MARISHA: It would look shifty.

01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:31.731
SAM: I could do that--

01:23:31.731 --> 01:23:39.209
MARISHA: I’m just saying, from my experience,
normally if you’re trying to do a coup--

01:23:39.209 --> 01:23:41.162
LIAM: Experience as a what?

01:23:42.492 --> 01:23:48.569
MARISHA: As a rebellious teenage woman. In my
experience, normally if you’re trying to do

01:23:48.569 --> 01:24:01.140
something bad, you’re not like “Dear diary, I did
this bad thing. Signed, Beauregard.” You get what

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:01.650
I’m putting down?

01:24:01.650 --> 01:24:02.784
TRAVIS: Yeah, it’d be obvious.

01:24:02.784 --> 01:24:09.045
MARISHA: Correct. We want to look-- if it’s too
obvious, it’s the opposite of convincing.

01:24:09.045 --> 01:24:10.684
TRAVIS: Sign it somebody else’s name.

01:24:11.264 --> 01:24:18.407
MARISHA: This guy goes by The Gentleman because he
is smart. That’s all I’m saying.

01:24:19.747 --> 01:24:25.217
LIAM: We want to put information in Sutan’s
house-- elder-- right? We could have some sort of

01:24:25.217 --> 01:24:32.765
writing that is not from the High-Richter, but
that says “H-R would prefer the plans to go into motion--"

01:24:32.765 --> 01:24:35.583
LAURA: “H-R wants a meeting with you.”

01:24:37.043 --> 01:24:40.425
MARISHA: “Spoke to The Myriad,” yeah…

01:24:40.425 --> 01:24:42.092
TALIESIN: “Finalized the plans.”

01:24:42.092 --> 01:24:47.516
LIAM: I propose that we make it seem like Sutan
and the High-Richter were conspiring to have

01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:55.216
Orentha killed. So we have a note put into Sutan’s
house that says: “On behalf--” from an

01:24:55.216 --> 01:25:02.317
intermediary, “On behalf of HR, wants the plan to
go into motion immediately and that Orentha will

01:25:02.317 --> 01:25:04.791
be out for the festival tonight.

01:25:04.791 --> 01:25:06.159
LAURA: The Big O. We should say Big O.

01:25:06.159 --> 01:25:07.801
LIAM: The Big O. That is good.

01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:12.117
SAM: We are so much better than the other people
at planning like this.

01:25:12.117 --> 01:25:15.511
(laughter)

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:20.017
LIAM: Then we plant that in Sutan elder’s house
when we successfully, quietly break in.

01:25:20.017 --> 01:25:22.122
LAURA: I’ll start writing that note right now.

01:25:24.492 --> 01:25:27.210
SAM: In block letters? Can’t be traced to anyone?
That sort of thing?

01:25:27.210 --> 01:25:29.599
LIAM: Well, it’s an intermediary, so does not have
to look--

01:25:29.599 --> 01:25:30.498
MARISHA: It doesn’t really matter.

01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:32.347
LAURA: I’ll make it look crisp and--

01:25:35.207 --> 01:25:37.499
SAM: Make it look like evil calligraphy.

01:25:37.499 --> 01:25:39.505
LAURA: Yeah, like evil handwriting.

01:25:39.505 --> 01:25:44.708
LIAM: This letter perhaps on its own is not
enough, but with the seal, if we have a matching

01:25:44.708 --> 01:25:46.689
letter planted in HR’s home--

01:25:46.689 --> 01:25:52.282
LAURA: Yeah. Got your messages. I will move the
meeting up and the Big O is going to die for sure.

01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:53.968
SAM: Ooh yeah!

01:25:53.968 --> 01:25:56.810
MARISHA: And a little bribery if we’re trying to
go for something.

01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:59.194
LAURA: But where are we going to get this money
you keep talking about?

01:25:59.194 --> 01:26:00.382
TALIESIN: We can just promise them money.

01:26:00.382 --> 01:26:05.987
LAURA: Here’s the thing, having seen people be
bribed before: you need very large sums of money

01:26:05.987 --> 01:26:11.602
for bribing. Especially with rich people. They’re
not going to need 500 gold to do this sort of

01:26:11.602 --> 01:26:14.582
thing, they want 5000 gold for this sort of
thing.

01:26:14.582 --> 01:26:19.476
MARISHA: It depends. If you’re just handing money
off to an assassin. If it’s a lowly level person,

01:26:19.476 --> 01:26:24.402
might not need much. Doesn’t need to be the whole
amount. Just needs to be a payment, maybe.

01:26:24.402 --> 01:26:26.016
SAM: A check?

01:26:26.469 --> 01:26:32.725
LAURA: A check? An IOU. “On behalf of HR-- “

01:26:32.725 --> 01:26:39.499
LIAM: Keep your writing very plain. Not immensely
charming--

01:26:39.499 --> 01:26:40.550
SAM: Traceable!

01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:43.409
LIAM: No, I mean not charming, like the way you
speak.

01:26:43.409 --> 01:26:44.763
LAURA: So no hearts above the i’s then?

01:26:44.763 --> 01:26:45.896
LIAM: No. No.

01:26:48.266 --> 01:26:51.754
LAURA: I write, “On behalf of HR-- “

01:26:51.754 --> 01:26:52.718
LIAM: Yeah, that’s good.

01:26:54.228 --> 01:26:55.785
LAURA: What comes after that?

01:26:58.495 --> 01:27:01.602
MARISHA: The Big O thing. The plan against the Big
O.

01:27:01.602 --> 01:27:05.087
LIAM: “HR would like the plan to be moved
forward.”

01:27:05.087 --> 01:27:06.376
MARISHA: “It will commence-- “

01:27:06.376 --> 01:27:07.072
TRAVIS: “As discussed.”

01:27:07.072 --> 01:27:09.295
MARISHA: “Commence as discussed.”

01:27:09.295 --> 01:27:10.028
SAM: Sounds official.

01:27:11.458 --> 01:27:16.173
LAURA: “On behalf of HR, the plan-- “

01:27:16.173 --> 01:27:19.368
LIAM: “The plan is moving up to tomorrow night, at
the festival.”

01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:24.076
LAURA: “The plan is moving up to tomorrow night,
at the festival.”

01:27:24.736 --> 01:27:29.356
LIAM: “The moment has come, and it is time for us
to seize it.”

01:27:29.356 --> 01:27:30.809
LAURA: That’s what I write.

01:27:30.809 --> 01:27:34.031
MATT: Okay. You work out the logistics of that
letter--

01:27:34.031 --> 01:27:35.779
MARISHA: And it sounds super boss.

01:27:35.779 --> 01:27:38.701
LAURA: “Yours truly, forever and ever, your BFF--
“

01:27:38.701 --> 01:27:39.414
SAM: No, no!

01:27:39.414 --> 01:27:40.025
LAURA: No?

01:27:40.485 --> 01:27:44.401
SAM: Take out the part where you say, “Do you like
me? If so, check this box.”

01:27:44.401 --> 01:27:46.323
(laughter)

01:27:46.323 --> 01:27:47.542
TALIESIN: I thought that tied the whole thing
together.

01:27:47.542 --> 01:27:48.211
LAURA: Yeah, I thought it was good.

01:27:49.261 --> 01:27:50.957
TRAVIS: And no perfume on the letter.

01:27:50.957 --> 01:27:55.772
MARISHA: Aw, you beat me to it! No signing it with
a kiss.

01:27:55.772 --> 01:28:05.992
LAURA: If I fold it up like a little triangle.
Just a simple--

01:28:05.992 --> 01:28:07.535
TALIESIN: What kind of dog?

01:28:07.535 --> 01:28:08.203
SAM: What?

01:28:08.203 --> 01:28:09.159
MARISHA: What kind of dog?

01:28:09.159 --> 01:28:11.334
LAURA: Oh wait! Should I fold it or should I
scroll it?

01:28:11.334 --> 01:28:13.289
SAM: Scroll it! Because we’re going to--

01:28:13.289 --> 01:28:14.226
MATT: The guard dog that was outside of the home?

01:28:14.226 --> 01:28:14.856
TALIESIN: There’s a guard dog.

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:15.711
MATT: It was a mastiff.

01:28:15.711 --> 01:28:21.490
TALIESIN: It was a mastiff? Was it a well-kept dog
or-- was it a dog of pride or just a dog of--?

01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:28.673
MATT: From what you guys saw of the mastiff, it
wasn’t a show dog by any means, but it wasn’t a

01:28:28.673 --> 01:28:31.948
street dog they’re just using for the moment.

01:28:31.948 --> 01:28:33.426
TRAVIS: Was it a talking mastiff?

01:28:33.426 --> 01:28:34.884
MATT: One way to find out!

01:28:34.884 --> 01:28:39.621
TALIESIN: Does it look like the sort of dog that
you can actually be proud of or is it just a utility?

01:28:39.632 --> 01:28:46.761
MATT: It looks like it’s a utility dog. You’ve
seen some dogs go around with members of the

01:28:46.761 --> 01:28:51.963
crownsguard before as part of the general-- It’s
more for an intimidation tactic. They’re rarely

01:28:51.963 --> 01:28:58.105
ever utilized, but the presence of a dog just make
some people, especially those who work in darker

01:28:58.105 --> 01:28:58.877
categories, unsettled.

01:28:58.877 --> 01:29:00.128
TALIESIN: We have a cat.

01:29:00.128 --> 01:29:01.729
MARISHA: Can the cat become a mastiff?

01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:04.250
LAURA: Can the cat get the dog--

01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:05.083
LIAM: To chase it away.

01:29:05.083 --> 01:29:05.732
LAURA: Yeah.

01:29:05.732 --> 01:29:07.213
TALIESIN: Then someone would have to get the dog
back.

01:29:07.213 --> 01:29:09.267
SAM: Just shoot the dog with an arrow and kill
it.

01:29:09.267 --> 01:29:10.637
TALIESIN: I’m just talking about getting the dog--
no!

01:29:12.457 --> 01:29:13.055
TRAVIS: Nott.

01:29:14.715 --> 01:29:17.424
TALIESIN: Somebody’s going to have to retrieve the
dog if the dog goes running.

01:29:17.424 --> 01:29:18.504
MARISHA: Here’s the deal, Nott--

01:29:18.504 --> 01:29:19.277
LIAM: We don’t want a dead dog.

01:29:19.277 --> 01:29:24.490
MARISHA: Yeah. we need to leave no trace. The only
way this gets pulled off is if--

01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:25.979
TALIESIN: This is the subtle one.

01:29:27.459 --> 01:29:30.762
MARISHA: Is if no one thinks anyone was there.
Ever.

01:29:32.192 --> 01:29:33.540
SAM: Show the dog your dick.

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:40.931
TALIESIN: I’m not showing anybody-- there’s no
more of that. What if the dog runs? The guard will

01:29:40.931 --> 01:29:42.130
have to get the dog back.

01:29:42.130 --> 01:29:43.260
LAURA: They’ll chase after the dog.

01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:45.636
LIAM: Yeah. Frumpkin can do that very well.

01:29:45.636 --> 01:29:49.093
LAURA: We can try that. If it doesn’t work, then
we try to jump up and over.

01:29:49.463 --> 01:29:52.710
LIAM: Also, sausages are very inexpensive, so we
have that as a Plan B.

01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:57.234
MARISHA: We also have good ol’ Fjord, who can
always disguise himself as a guard.

01:29:57.234 --> 01:29:58.796
LAURA: And relieve him.

01:29:58.796 --> 01:29:59.519
MARISHA: Correct.

01:29:59.519 --> 01:30:03.821
LAURA: Say that somebody really wants him over at
the party.

01:30:03.821 --> 01:30:07.150
LIAM: Are they private guards, though, or are they
crownsguard?

01:30:07.150 --> 01:30:08.632
MARISHA and MATT: They were crownsguard.

01:30:08.632 --> 01:30:09.423
MATT: They were assigned.

01:30:11.243 --> 01:30:15.277
LIAM: Do you know what, Nott, if you want-- one
idea, if you want to help, is you can also write a

01:30:15.277 --> 01:30:24.928
note in your Thieves’ Cant. It should be vague on
details, but a message from the Myriad. Or don’t

01:30:24.928 --> 01:30:31.833
even get that specific, but write, in Thieves’
Cant, a note saying that everything is in place

01:30:31.833 --> 01:30:32.995
for the festival.

01:30:32.995 --> 01:30:34.479
MARISHA: I think that’s a good idea.

01:30:34.479 --> 01:30:37.490
SAM: All right. Sure. I need a few papers.

01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:40.130
MARISHA: A few papers are always good.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:48.017
MATT: All right. As you guys work your way through
preparing this letter, condensing your plots for

01:30:48.017 --> 01:30:52.419
the next evening, and eventually find yourself to
a night’s rest in preparation for the next day’s

01:30:52.419 --> 01:30:53.978
events, we’re going to take a break!

01:30:55.758 --> 01:30:58.630
LIAM: No, but I think we should go back to the
hospital one more time.

01:30:58.630 --> 01:31:02.311
MATT: (laughs) Fucking D&amp;D.

01:31:03.521 --> 01:31:09.495
LAURA: Watching your face, Matt, as all that was
happening. You were like, what are they doing?

01:31:09.495 --> 01:31:14.033
MATT: Those are my favorite moments of the game!
I’m like, I don’t-- okay, guys! This is happening!

01:31:14.923 --> 01:31:16.018
This is all your fault.

01:31:16.018 --> 01:31:17.270
TALIESIN: It was a great plan.

01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:21.440
MATT: So yes, before we go to break, our friends
at Wyrmwood have their giveaway for the evening.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:28.154
You need to be in the Twitch chat room to
participate. Right now, the offer's only good for

01:31:28.154 --> 01:31:32.924
residents of the United States and Canada,
excluding Quebec, because, apparently, Quebec. For

01:31:32.924 --> 01:31:36.796
the official rules, you can find the link in the
chat tonight, but tonight it is the Flame Box

01:31:36.796 --> 01:31:46.017
Elder Deck Box, which is pretty awesome. Oh, and
it came with a Magic pack with a guy going (screams)

01:31:46.017 --> 01:31:47.922
LIAM: Is he at the hospital?

01:31:47.922 --> 01:31:49.700
MARISHA: Why is there a Magic pack in there?

01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:55.569
MATT: It's a deck box. The pack comes with it,
too. So go ahead and enter into the chat room--

01:31:55.569 --> 01:32:00.254
the word for this break is “Heist”. H-E-I-S-T.
Remember, only enter it once. If you enter it more

01:32:00.254 --> 01:32:05.397
than once, you will be disqualified,
unfortunately. We'll get to that, and we'll have

01:32:05.397 --> 01:32:08.152
the winner in the break. In the meantime, we'll
see you back here in a few minutes.

01:32:09.381 --> 01:45:10.784
[break]

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:16.269
MATT: Hello, and welcome back, everybody. We have
a winner from the chat. Congratulations to

01:45:16.419 --> 01:45:22.472
PyroMalibu. PyroMalibu is the winner of the box.
Denoba will get your information in the chat if he

01:45:22.472 --> 01:45:28.171
hasn't already, and we'll get that to you, so
congratulations. So, as you guys all prepare for

01:45:28.171 --> 01:45:32.106
the evening’s rest, the next day-- is there
anything you needed to do before the next day

01:45:32.106 --> 01:45:33.273
happens?

01:45:33.273 --> 01:45:44.277
SAM: I would like to talk to Caleb. (clears
throat) Oh, Caleb? Nott here. I have a favor to

01:45:44.277 --> 01:45:51.715
ask of you. I absconded with some items recently,
and I wanted you to take a look at them with your

01:45:51.715 --> 01:45:53.311
keen eye.

01:45:53.311 --> 01:45:56.059
LIAM: Where did you get these items?

01:45:56.059 --> 01:46:01.769
SAM: It was not-- I didn’t break in anywhere-- I
mean, we did, but it was cool because other people

01:46:01.769 --> 01:46:08.006
were with me. It’s when we went down into the
basement to scout around for other entrances into

01:46:08.006 --> 01:46:10.948
the bottom of the Leaky Tap.

01:46:10.948 --> 01:46:13.197
LIAM: Under the Leaky Tap? And you found?

01:46:13.197 --> 01:46:20.852
SAM: I found a skeleton that had these bracelets
on her? Him? They?

01:46:20.852 --> 01:46:22.724
LIAM: You found a skeleton?

01:46:22.724 --> 01:46:25.272
SAM: Yeah, I don't know. I didn't really have time
to look at it.

01:46:25.272 --> 01:46:27.898
LIAM: You found a dead person?

01:46:27.898 --> 01:46:31.243
SAM: A very old dead person. Could be ancient.

01:46:31.243 --> 01:46:35.308
LIAM: Yeah, but it's not really typical to keep a
dead-- like a skeleton in your basement.

01:46:35.308 --> 01:46:37.538
SAM: I didn't think about that, but yes.

01:46:37.538 --> 01:46:39.207
TRAVIS: Nor in your closet.

01:46:39.207 --> 01:46:46.945
LIAM: Well, that's a topic for the group. We're
staying in an inn where there was a dead person.

01:46:47.066 --> 01:46:50.616
SAM: I don't think it's haunted or anything. It
just seemed like someone-- it was stuffed way in

01:46:50.616 --> 01:46:53.605
the corner behind some boxes 
like someone wanted to--

01:46:53.605 --> 01:46:56.640
LIAM: Yeah, that's worse. That's not better,
that's worse.

01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:02.110
SAM: I didn't-- I mean--
I'm really just interested in these.

01:47:02.316 --> 01:47:04.615
(laughter)

01:47:05.764 --> 01:47:11.204
LIAM: Okay, well, that's somewhat unsettling, but
show me these items that you have.

01:47:11.204 --> 01:47:15.292
SAM: These are just bracelets that I found. I was
wondering if you could use your magic skills.

01:47:15.292 --> 01:47:19.766
LIAM: I place them down on the bed and go through
the process of casting Identify on them. It takes

01:47:19.766 --> 01:47:21.038
about ten minutes.

01:47:21.038 --> 01:47:25.207
MATT: Okay. As you finish the focus, you glance
down at them, extending your consciousness to see

01:47:25.207 --> 01:47:33.043
if there's any residual magic energy. They're not
enchanted, but they are made of a very nice, solid

01:47:33.043 --> 01:47:37.172
platinum with a gold spiral lay on them, once you
pull the dust off, so they’re probably worth a

01:47:37.172 --> 01:47:39.009
little bit of money.

01:47:39.009 --> 01:47:43.674
LIAM: You should sell these. These are not little
and adorable like buttons.

01:47:43.674 --> 01:47:45.943
SAM: No, but they're shiny and nice.

01:47:45.943 --> 01:47:47.870
LIAM: Do you want to wear them?

01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:50.955
SAM: Ooh. Maybe I could.

01:47:50.955 --> 01:47:53.202
LIAM: Well, you could. What--

01:47:53.202 --> 01:47:55.081
SAM: Are they big?

01:47:55.081 --> 01:47:57.226
LIAM: Are they huge for a goblin’s little wrists?

01:47:57.226 --> 01:48:03.249
MATT: For a goblin’s wrists, they're pretty big.
Looks like they're more-- they may have been made

01:48:03.249 --> 01:48:08.878
for a more masculine figure’s wrists probably, or
a thick-armed lass.

01:48:08.878 --> 01:48:14.985
LIAM: Maybe your ankle or calf, you could put them
on. Or sell them and then you could put them to use.

01:48:15.051 --> 01:48:16.508
SAM: All right. Okay.

01:48:16.508 --> 01:48:19.356
LIAM: I'm still a little disturbed that there's a
dead person under this inn that we're in right

01:48:19.356 --> 01:48:20.236
now.

01:48:20.236 --> 01:48:27.533
SAM: I understand. Well, we can go back and I can
show you, if you'd like, but it didn't seem like--

01:48:27.646 --> 01:48:30.734
LIAM: Well, I take your word for it, that it's
there. I don't need to go poking about.

01:48:30.734 --> 01:48:34.446
SAM: How do you do that? Where you look at
something and you just see what it is?

01:48:34.446 --> 01:48:38.250
LIAM: Well, it is a spell that I learned when I
was--

01:48:38.250 --> 01:48:43.121
SAM: It's so cool! It's very impressive.

01:48:43.121 --> 01:48:45.107
LIAM: You could potentially learn this as well.

01:48:45.107 --> 01:48:45.769
SAM: Really?

01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:47.845
LIAM: Of course! If you apply yourself--

01:48:47.845 --> 01:48:54.815
SAM: I don't know. You know so many spells and so
many things. You're very strong. I'm continually

01:48:54.815 --> 01:49:04.682
impressed by you, I must say. How strong would you
say you are? On a scale of one to 20?

01:49:04.682 --> 01:49:14.483
LIAM: How do you mean-- I'm not very strong, Nott.
I do have things that I want to do with my life,

01:49:14.483 --> 01:49:19.750
and I mean to apply myself and study, and find
knowledge.

01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:24.531
SAM: Is that the way you'll get even stronger?
Through study and books?

01:49:24.531 --> 01:49:28.207
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> That is the best way to do that. For
anyone.

01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:38.304
SAM: Would magical items help further your
abilities or blessings?

01:49:38.304 --> 01:49:42.516
LIAM: That seems like an abstract question. There
are certainly very useful things that can be found

01:49:42.516 --> 01:49:46.133
in this world. You never know.

01:49:46.133 --> 01:49:48.011
SAM: All right.

01:49:49.069 --> 01:49:50.684
LIAM: Are you okay?

01:49:50.684 --> 01:49:59.921
SAM: Oh, I'm fine, I'm just fascinated by all
things wizard and I want you to succeed, that's

01:49:59.921 --> 01:50:07.882
all. I have great faith in you, I know you'll do
great things, and I just want to help you get

01:50:07.882 --> 01:50:09.094
there.

01:50:09.094 --> 01:50:12.461
LIAM: Well, thank you, friend.

01:50:12.461 --> 01:50:20.368
SAM: Sure. Yes. Anything, anything to help the
cause.

01:50:21.753 --> 01:50:27.533
LIAM: Well, maybe we go to bed and tomorrow we
don't tear the roof down off of every building we

01:50:27.533 --> 01:50:29.316
go into again, yeah?

01:50:29.316 --> 01:50:31.575
SAM: Okay. Sounds good.

01:50:31.575 --> 01:50:35.909
LIAM: So I take out my silver thread and I start
casting the Alarm spell on our room before bed,

01:50:35.909 --> 01:50:37.836
and then I go to bed.

01:50:37.836 --> 01:50:41.943
MATT: All righty. Anybody else have anything to do
before the evening's rest, or are you happy to

01:50:41.943 --> 01:50:43.978
continue the next day?

01:50:43.978 --> 01:50:45.293
TRAVIS: Next day for me.

01:50:45.293 --> 01:50:47.444
LAURA: (shouting) Pillow fight!

01:50:48.945 --> 01:50:51.610
MARISHA: Beau gets a little too aggressive with
the pillow fight.

01:50:51.734 --> 01:50:54.046
LAURA: Ow, okay. We're done.

01:50:54.046 --> 01:50:55.956
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry.

01:50:55.956 --> 01:50:58.509
LIAM: Mess with the bull, get the horns.

01:50:59.946 --> 01:51:03.517
MATT: All right, so, as the evening comes to a
close, the next morning greets you on a somewhat

01:51:03.517 --> 01:51:09.089
chilled, misty morning, the sky gray, but the
light is out. You can see a faint mist is burning

01:51:09.089 --> 01:51:16.795
off of the streets in the early morning, like six
or seven-ish. You all gather yourselves. Is there

01:51:16.795 --> 01:51:20.158
anything you wish to accomplish during the day, or
do you wish to jump ahead to the meeting of the

01:51:20.158 --> 01:51:22.200
afternoon, the evening?

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:25.151
MARISHA: Should we get some awesome all-black
clothes?

01:51:25.151 --> 01:51:28.672
LAURA: Maybe we should so that we stealth better.

01:51:28.672 --> 01:51:31.162
MARISHA: Yeah, something a little bit more
stealthy.

01:51:31.162 --> 01:51:32.747
LAURA: We can put it in the pink bag.

01:51:32.747 --> 01:51:34.888
MARISHA: Oh, I like that.

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:37.710
TALIESIN: I was thinking some carnival masks, from
the other direction.

01:51:37.710 --> 01:51:41.338
TRAVIS: Yeah, all black looks like you're up to no
good.

01:51:41.338 --> 01:51:45.059
LIAM: Yeah, and if you are actually in the dark,
you can't tell the difference, and if you're in

01:51:45.059 --> 01:51:50.077
the light you look like a ninja, so I think we're
good, maybe.

01:51:50.077 --> 01:51:53.738
MARISHA: I see what you're saying. Yeah.

01:51:53.738 --> 01:51:56.138
TALIESIN: Everyone’s going to be pretty
fancy-dressed.

01:51:56.138 --> 01:51:58.164
LAURA: The carnival is going on today?

01:51:58.164 --> 01:52:00.178
MATT: Yeah, the festival is happening this
evening.

01:52:00.178 --> 01:52:04.447
MARISHA: Do we know anything about this festival,
like, culturally? Do they wear masks?

01:52:04.447 --> 01:52:10.130
MATT: I mean, the harvest is celebrated at
different points, and in a few weeks is the

01:52:10.130 --> 01:52:17.132
official Harvest End festival. This is done in
advance, it's more of a private event that is for

01:52:17.132 --> 01:52:22.992
the more elite. Some folks come in from out of
town, from local smaller townships that are pretty

01:52:22.992 --> 01:52:33.047
well off and trying to rub elbows with the local
elite. It's a festival that contains food, music,

01:52:33.047 --> 01:52:37.486
drink. You've never been to one, of course, and
you've heard of it from the time you spent in

01:52:37.486 --> 01:52:42.354
Zadash. You've never seen it, but you've seen
folks take care through the street towards the

01:52:42.354 --> 01:52:51.065
event, and it seems to be fairly like a more
subdued Mardi Gras colors, but the colors are more

01:52:51.065 --> 01:52:56.121
reds and browns and golds. They have masks they'll
wear for it, but they aren't full face, just

01:52:56.121 --> 01:53:02.119
habitual eye masks. Only some will, some folks
don't get fully into the spirit.

01:53:02.119 --> 01:53:04.840
MARISHA: I think we should go shopping.

01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:06.201
TALIESIN: Masks on sticks.

01:53:06.201 --> 01:53:07.747
MARISHA: Masks on sticks.

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:14.154
LAURA: Well, we're not actually going to the fancy
gala, so we probably don't need the fancy stuff,

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:16.709
because it's just for the rich people.

01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:18.598
MARISHA: But will it get us through the gate?

01:53:18.598 --> 01:53:22.642
LAURA: Well, I figure for all of us to get in, we
should go through the sewers, probably.

01:53:22.642 --> 01:53:26.041
TALIESIN: If someone stops you, if you have a
mask, they know why you're there.

01:53:26.041 --> 01:53:27.700
LIAM: Yeah, in a pinch.

01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:29.582
LAURA: Sure.

01:53:31.012 --> 01:53:36.364
LIAM: A lot is riding on Sutan and the
High-Richter going to this festival.

01:53:40.354 --> 01:53:41.454
LAURA: Yeah.

01:53:41.574 --> 01:53:42.749
LIAM: That's it, that's all.

01:53:42.749 --> 01:53:43.823
(laughter)

01:53:43.823 --> 01:53:45.035
TALIESIN: I was really expecting more there.

01:53:45.035 --> 01:53:46.414
LIAM: No, it's just pessimism.

01:53:46.414 --> 01:53:48.070
LAURA: Let's go buy some masks, then.

01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:50.833
MARISHA: Are you afraid they're not party people?

01:53:50.833 --> 01:53:55.503
LIAM: Well, I worry that if we break into Sutan's
house and stuff a bunch of letters there, but the

01:53:55.503 --> 01:54:00.043
High-Richter stays in with a tummy ache, then it
all falls apart.

01:54:00.043 --> 01:54:02.356
MARISHA: Well, then we go from there.

01:54:02.356 --> 01:54:07.201
LAURA: There's no point in worrying about things
you can't change yet, Caleb.

01:54:07.201 --> 01:54:10.468
MARISHA: She's got a point.

01:54:10.468 --> 01:54:13.493
TALIESIN: Be the chaos you want to see in the
world.

01:54:13.493 --> 01:54:16.097
TRAVIS: Yeah, no point in worrying, it only makes
it hurt twice.

01:54:16.097 --> 01:54:18.611
LIAM: Yeah, lead the way, I'll be the caboose.

01:54:18.611 --> 01:54:23.801
MATT: All right. Who’s helming the expedition to
acquire costume pieces?

01:54:23.801 --> 01:54:25.325
TRAVIS: Molly.

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:26.974
MATT: Molly, go ahead and make an investigation
check.

01:54:26.974 --> 01:54:28.524
(laughter)

01:54:28.524 --> 01:54:30.537
MATT: I'll say, because of your dress, I'll give
you advantage on this.

01:54:30.537 --> 01:54:32.566
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:54:32.566 --> 01:54:35.209
MARISHA: Show us where Melrose is.

01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:39.187
TALIESIN: Looking for Melrose. 11.

01:54:39.187 --> 01:54:43.732
MATT: 11. It takes you the better part of the
morning. About noon, you manage to find a place

01:54:43.732 --> 01:54:48.523
that will sell similar outfits. Since a lot of
them are either custom-made for the individuals

01:54:48.523 --> 01:54:52.384
that are going, it's hard to find a place. There
is no shop that sells fancy clothes to the random

01:54:52.384 --> 01:54:56.014
folks who aren't going to the event, but you
manage to find a few individuals that can cobble

01:54:56.014 --> 01:55:01.076
together a few masks and basic attire. Because
it's a quick build, it's going to be a little

01:55:01.076 --> 01:55:04.594
pricier than normal cost, so the commission will
take the better part of the afternoon, and will be

01:55:04.594 --> 01:55:09.506
ready by sundown for enough outfits for six of
you. Or accoutrements.

01:55:09.506 --> 01:55:11.587
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I don't need much.

01:55:11.587 --> 01:55:14.651
MATT: You'll be fine, it's just a mask. I'd say
between all of you, for the time, the materials,

01:55:14.651 --> 01:55:19.257
and the construction of it, it’ll run you about
three gold pieces.

01:55:19.257 --> 01:55:20.525
TALIESIN: I'll pay that.

01:55:20.525 --> 01:55:22.230
TRAVIS: You'll pay for all of it?

01:55:22.230 --> 01:55:25.632
TALIESIN: Yeah. I will get reimbursed at the end.

01:55:25.632 --> 01:55:28.096
LIAM: I’ll pick up some sausages.

01:55:28.096 --> 01:55:32.635
MATT: Okay. How many sausages do you want?

01:55:32.635 --> 01:55:35.402
LIAM: Oh, just the one string of them. Four or
five.

01:55:35.402 --> 01:55:37.116
SAM: Maybe two strings.

01:55:37.116 --> 01:55:38.372
LIAM: Two strings in case.

01:55:38.372 --> 01:55:39.694
(laughter)

01:55:39.694 --> 01:55:44.021
MATT: In case you get hungry? Fair enough. Okay.
That's going to put you back a silver.

01:55:44.021 --> 01:55:52.039
LAURA: Oh, and I'm going to write another letter
that says something about the Knights of Requital.

01:55:52.039 --> 01:56:01.151
That says, like-- what should it be? "I'm glad to
be working with you! You sure are nice!"

01:56:01.151 --> 01:56:06.450
TRAVIS: What about a sign-off, like, "The Knights
of Requital are rising."

01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:11.325
SAM: What if you take a letter and just sign it
“Knights of Requital” and rip off the rest, so who

01:56:11.325 --> 01:56:14.280
knows what it was, it's just from them.

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:22.002
LAURA: Yeah. I'll end it with, "the big red door.
The Knights of Requital." Then rip it, and then it

01:56:22.002 --> 01:56:25.381
is just the bottom part and leave it in the
High-Richter's house.

01:56:25.381 --> 01:56:28.707
MARISHA: Leave it in the trash. That's not bad,
that's not bad.

01:56:28.707 --> 01:56:33.663
LAURA: Oh, can somebody burn the edge like the
rest was in the fire or something? Oh, and then we

01:56:33.663 --> 01:56:37.529
can put it in the fireplace like the rest of the
letter was burned!

01:56:37.529 --> 01:56:41.631
MARISHA: Man, that is the oldest trick in the
book. Sure.

01:56:41.631 --> 01:56:46.084
LAURA: Caleb, burn just these edges here.

01:56:46.084 --> 01:56:48.866
LIAM: Okay, put it down on the ground.

01:56:48.866 --> 01:56:52.427
LAURA: But just the edges, don't set the whole
thing on fire, because I spent a really long time

01:56:52.427 --> 01:56:54.330
writing that little bit.

01:56:54.330 --> 01:56:58.003
LIAM: Ah, well, then use a hearth fire or
something, because I will probably put that into

01:56:58.003 --> 01:57:03.051
flames. Also, alternatively, would we want maybe
something instead that said that "the Knights are

01:57:03.051 --> 01:57:09.400
ready for this evening’s pursuits, and they’re to
support any endeavors as needed, great

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:12.313
High-Richter. It is time for change."

01:57:12.313 --> 01:57:15.680
LAURA: I write all of that, okay, fine.

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:17.928
MARISHA: Don't write “the Knights”, though, just
write the little symbol.

01:57:17.928 --> 01:57:22.475
LAURA: Yeah. Then I'll put the symbol. But I'm
also going to keep this one to put in the

01:57:22.475 --> 01:57:24.897
fireplace, because I think it will be really cool.

01:57:24.897 --> 01:57:29.457
LIAM: Yes, the two together, but I worry that just
the one piece, she could have written it down on a

01:57:29.457 --> 01:57:33.351
list of things she does not like, it's not very
conclusive. But the two together.

01:57:33.351 --> 01:57:36.223
SAM: She doesn't like red doors, she doesn't like
the Knights of Requital.

01:57:36.223 --> 01:57:41.162
LAURA: Now we have those letters. I'm going to
keep track, I'm putting them in the side pouch,

01:57:41.162 --> 01:57:44.010
those are the side pouch ones.

01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:48.925
LIAM: Have you written your letter in your
thieves’ thingy that you do?

01:57:48.925 --> 01:57:53.243
SAM: Yes. I did. My handwriting is not as good.

01:57:53.243 --> 01:57:55.774
LAURA: Is that going in Lord Sutan's place or the
High-Richter's place?

01:57:55.774 --> 01:57:57.525
LIAM: That's in Sutan's place.

01:57:57.525 --> 01:57:59.327
LAURA: So I'm putting that in the other pouch.

01:57:59.327 --> 01:58:04.762
LIAM: Good, we want to tie Sutan to the Myriad,
and High-Richter to the Knights, and High-Richter

01:58:04.762 --> 01:58:07.385
and Sutan together. That's the plan.

01:58:07.385 --> 01:58:10.126
MARISHA: To fight Orentha, to kill her.

01:58:10.126 --> 01:58:16.067
LIAM: Yes, to take that seat. To enact the change
that the people need.

01:58:16.067 --> 01:58:18.657
LAURA: We are definitely-- this is going to be
real good.

01:58:18.657 --> 01:58:25.100
MARISHA: I feel so political, you guys. I feel
like I'm participating in our politics, in a way.

01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:27.839
SAM: It feels nice to participate in a democracy
like this.

01:58:27.839 --> 01:58:30.357
MARISHA: It does, it feels like I'm making a
difference.

01:58:30.357 --> 01:58:32.879
SAM: One monk, one vote.

01:58:32.879 --> 01:58:34.607
(laughter)

01:58:34.607 --> 01:58:36.013
MARISHA: Feels like it matters.

01:58:36.013 --> 01:58:37.851
LIAM: Did we get paid in advance, by the way?

01:58:37.851 --> 01:58:40.092
LAURA: What are we being paid for this?

01:58:40.092 --> 01:58:42.779
MARISHA: Yeah, we didn't get paid in advance. I
hope that doesn't come back to bite us.

01:58:42.779 --> 01:58:44.531
LIAM: Did we get half of it, even?

01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:47.883
TALIESIN: It's for the best, because now there's
no paper trail, just in case they are trying to--

01:58:47.883 --> 01:58:50.747
LAURA: Is Ulog around? I'm going to look for Ulog.

01:58:50.747 --> 01:58:53.103
MATT: Ulog is meeting you guys, you want to try
and search for him?

01:58:53.103 --> 01:58:55.609
LAURA: I want to look and see if he's around us,
though.

01:58:55.609 --> 01:58:57.462
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:02.286
LAURA: I can't see shit.

01:59:02.286 --> 01:59:09.141
MATT: You have no idea where Ulog is, or if he's
in the vicinity, unfortunately. All right, so.

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:17.201
LIAM: We should also-- you're invisible. We should
also discuss who's going in, who's outside, how we

01:59:17.201 --> 01:59:19.393
are tackling each house.

01:59:19.393 --> 01:59:24.228
LAURA: I should definitely go into Lord Sutan's
place, because I have this really fun spell that

01:59:24.228 --> 01:59:27.253
lets me find things. So I could find the seal.

01:59:27.253 --> 01:59:28.964
LIAM: How does it work?

01:59:28.964 --> 01:59:34.526
LAURA: I go, "I want to find this wax seal," and
it will help me find the one that’s closest.

01:59:34.526 --> 01:59:38.980
LIAM: Then you're right, you should go in. Nott,
you should go in, because you're going to pick

01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:40.404
locks, <i>ja</i>?

01:59:40.404 --> 01:59:41.452
SAM: Yes.

01:59:41.452 --> 01:59:45.226
LIAM: If anything is locked. I strongly believe
that I should go in as well, because these are two

01:59:45.226 --> 01:59:48.156
very wealthy, powerful people, and there could be
magical--

01:59:48.238 --> 01:59:49.770
LAURA: You're going to steal some stuff?

01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:53.557
LIAM: Only if that is, you know, easy to do.

01:59:53.557 --> 01:59:56.155
MARISHA: Once again, we should leave no trace that
we were there.

01:59:56.155 --> 02:00:00.844
SAM: Don't worry about that. I'll eat everything
we leave behind.

02:00:00.844 --> 02:00:03.312
TALIESIN: Now I'm really worried about it,
actually.

02:00:03.312 --> 02:00:06.709
TRAVIS: I'll be out front, I can be a crownsguard
if I need to.

02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:09.708
TALIESIN: And I can be in the back and be drunk
and lookout.

02:00:09.708 --> 02:00:12.171
SAM: Which is our first house that we're
attacking?

02:00:12.171 --> 02:00:13.338
TRAVIS: Lord Sutan.

02:00:13.338 --> 02:00:15.610
SAM: And we know that there's a guard and a dog
out there.

02:00:15.610 --> 02:00:16.800
MARISHA: Correct, so first--

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:18.818
SAM: So you guys need to distract the guard.

02:00:18.818 --> 02:00:21.406
MARISHA: With the cat. We've got the cat plan.

02:00:21.406 --> 02:00:22.642
SAM: And the sausage.

02:00:22.642 --> 02:00:24.224
LIAM: And the sausage, just in case.

02:00:24.224 --> 02:00:27.107
LAURA: Sausage for the guard, cat for the dog.

02:00:27.107 --> 02:00:33.450
LIAM: Regardless, even if this goes belly-up, we
just disappear. You know, we have no ties to this,

02:00:33.450 --> 02:00:38.532
we walk away, yeah? We just get out with our
skins, even if things go as badly as they did at

02:00:38.532 --> 02:00:42.146
the hospital, and then we go, we just walk away.

02:00:42.146 --> 02:00:45.875
MARISHA: Yeah, the last thing we want is for the
crownsguard to think that this was all us.

02:00:45.875 --> 02:00:47.742
LAURA: Where are we meeting Ulog?

02:00:47.742 --> 02:00:49.049
MARISHA: In front of the--

02:00:49.049 --> 02:00:50.583
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Song and Supper Inn.

02:00:50.583 --> 02:00:55.556
LIAM: Oh also, Frumpkin is up here in my sort of
scarf position, and I bring him down in my lap,

02:00:55.556 --> 02:00:59.593
and I take the sausages out, and I sort of like
knead one of the sausages in my hand a bit, and I

02:00:59.593 --> 02:01:04.787
say, you know, I'm sorry, but the next time that
you go off to your pocket place and come back,

02:01:04.787 --> 02:01:10.261
this will be gone. And I start squishing sausage
grease into his hair, and rubbing it down his back

02:01:10.261 --> 02:01:12.879
so that he smells like sausage.

02:01:12.879 --> 02:01:15.075
TALIESIN: That's a very good plan.

02:01:15.075 --> 02:01:19.009
LIAM: I love you very much, so thank you for this,
okay?

02:01:19.009 --> 02:01:22.419
ALL: (angry cat noises)

02:01:26.443 --> 02:01:29.012
LAURA: Do you want to eat him even more now?

02:01:30.802 --> 02:01:33.270
LIAM: Some other time, perhaps.

02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:35.810
SAM: I'll drink instead.

02:01:37.146 --> 02:01:42.135
MATT: You gather the outfits that were
commissioned for you. You have your materials. As

02:01:42.135 --> 02:01:49.679
the day grows later, eventually the sun begins to
crest over the western mountain range. The sky,

02:01:49.679 --> 02:01:57.906
though cloudy still, the colors begin to shift to
the oranges and purples of dusk. You begin to see

02:01:57.906 --> 02:02:02.742
carriages come through the streets and make their
way towards the Tri-Spire district.

02:02:02.742 --> 02:02:05.399
LAURA: Oh, I wonder if we can hide under the
carriages and just ride in.

02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:08.095
MARISHA: I was going to say, can we hop a ride?

02:02:08.095 --> 02:02:11.654
MATT: One of the carriages just passed you, and
it's about a block up the way if you want to try

02:02:11.654 --> 02:02:12.697
and catch up.

02:02:12.697 --> 02:02:17.892
MARISHA: No, that brings a lot of attention,
chasing after a carriage.

02:02:17.892 --> 02:02:20.035
LAURA: It's all about trying to get into the sewer
system.

02:02:20.035 --> 02:02:21.459
SAM: Can't we just go to the sewers?

02:02:21.459 --> 02:02:22.943
LAURA: Let's just go to the sewers.

02:02:22.943 --> 02:02:27.648
MATT: All right. As you guys head back towards the
entryway to the sewers, where you had previously

02:02:27.648 --> 02:02:33.029
been, with your various outfits and attire, you
can see now, there's not two crownsguards, there's

02:02:33.029 --> 02:02:39.392
a single crownsguard at the moment. You approach
and you see they're not directly against the

02:02:39.392 --> 02:02:44.603
grate, they're across the street. It doesn't
appear to be watched at the moment.

02:02:44.603 --> 02:02:45.729
SAM: The gate?

02:02:45.729 --> 02:02:49.176
MATT: The entranceway into the sewers.

02:02:49.176 --> 02:02:51.550
LAURA: Maybe I can go talk to the guard. Distract
him?

02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:53.260
SAM: It seems like they're not looking right now.

02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:54.788
LAURA: Oh, he's not even looking at the gate?

02:02:54.788 --> 02:02:56.266
SAM: No, they're not looking, we can just go.

02:02:56.266 --> 02:02:58.445
MATT: Well, he's not looking at the entranceway to
the sewer.

02:02:58.445 --> 02:03:00.461
MARISHA: That doesn't mean that won't change in 30
seconds.

02:03:00.461 --> 02:03:01.846
LAURA: It's dark outside, too?

02:03:01.846 --> 02:03:04.458
MATT: Yes, but there are lanterns and stuff up on
the side of the street.

02:03:04.458 --> 02:03:07.619
MARISHA: Do you want to distract him and we'll
meet you on the other side?

02:03:07.619 --> 02:03:12.161
LAURA: Oh, sure! I'll go meet you at the sewer
entrance on the other side.

02:03:12.161 --> 02:03:15.288
MARISHA: Okay. Nott or Caleb can send you a
message.

02:03:15.288 --> 02:03:18.066
LAURA: Okay. I walk up to the guard.

02:03:18.066 --> 02:03:20.209
MATT: Okay. "Evening."

02:03:20.209 --> 02:03:23.133
LAURA: Evening, how are you doing today?

02:03:23.133 --> 02:03:24.976
MATT: "I am well, how are you?"

02:03:24.976 --> 02:03:28.633
LAURA: Pretty good. I was wondering if you could
answer a question for me.

02:03:28.633 --> 02:03:31.106
MATT: Everybody else, roll a stealth check,
please.

02:03:31.106 --> 02:03:36.892
LAURA: I was looking around this area earlier for
a candy shop and I couldn't find <i>anything</i> that

02:03:36.892 --> 02:03:40.902
seemed good. I was wondering if you could point me
in the best direction.

02:03:40.902 --> 02:03:42.844
MATT: "Try the Pentamarket, probably."

02:03:42.844 --> 02:03:47.362
LAURA: The Pentamarket, um, okay. Can you tell me
exactly where that is? Because I'm not familiar

02:03:47.362 --> 02:03:49.079
with the area.

02:03:49.699 --> 02:03:51.851
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:03:52.946 --> 02:03:56.354
LAURA: Oh no. Oh, that's okay.

02:03:59.573 --> 02:04:00.755
19!

02:04:00.755 --> 02:04:05.162
MATT: "All right, so down this way--" and he
starts giving you the full play-by-play of the

02:04:05.162 --> 02:04:08.644
street corners to the Pentamarket where a candy
shop is that you had missed earlier. So now you

02:04:08.644 --> 02:04:10.786
know there's a candy shop in Zadash.

02:04:10.786 --> 02:04:11.944
LAURA: Yay!

02:04:11.944 --> 02:04:13.230
MATT: As it's happening. What did you roll?

02:04:13.230 --> 02:04:13.906
TRAVIS: 12.

02:04:13.906 --> 02:04:14.681
MARISHA: 15.

02:04:14.681 --> 02:04:15.585
LIAM: Eight.

02:04:15.585 --> 02:04:17.268
SAM: Natural one.

02:04:17.268 --> 02:04:19.190
LAURA: Oh, come on.

02:04:19.190 --> 02:04:20.613
TALIESIN: 19.

02:04:20.613 --> 02:04:28.936
MATT: Hold on, so a natural one, eight, 19, 15.
Okay, natural one’s tricky.

02:04:28.936 --> 02:04:32.214
SAM: Plus eight.

02:04:32.214 --> 02:04:39.272
MATT: Still a natural one. But, yeah, that brings
it to nine. As you guys begin to quickly slide in,

02:04:39.272 --> 02:04:44.531
one after the other, Nott, as you're rushing down,
you're glancing off, because you hear them talk

02:04:44.531 --> 02:04:45.983
about candy for a second over the side.

02:04:45.983 --> 02:04:47.027
SAM: Ooh!

02:04:47.027 --> 02:04:52.349
MATT: As you rush down the side, whack! You hit
your head and give out a natural instinct, a

02:04:52.349 --> 02:04:59.778
pained squeak. As you do, the guard who's talking
to Jester goes, “Wha--”

02:05:00.023 --> 02:05:03.955
LAURA: (fake coughs loudly) Can you help me? I
think I’m choking.

02:05:03.955 --> 02:05:05.870
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:05:08.198 --> 02:05:10.383
LAURA: Oh no. Seven.

02:05:10.383 --> 02:05:11.266
MATT: Seven.

02:05:11.266 --> 02:05:12.660
LAURA: (fake coughs loudly)

02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:14.246
MATT: “Hold. Just a second.”

02:05:14.246 --> 02:05:15.724
LAURA: Oh no, I can’t breathe at all, though.

02:05:15.724 --> 02:05:21.553
MATT: He begins walking over to the sewer edge. He
steps over and begins to glance down--

02:05:21.553 --> 02:05:26.618
LAURA: I fall over on the ground and really like
(choking sounds).

02:05:26.618 --> 02:05:28.598
MATT: He’s looking back at you like--

02:05:28.598 --> 02:05:30.316
LAURA: (choking sounds)

02:05:30.316 --> 02:05:36.588
LIAM: I send Frumpkin screeching away from us, up
the street, clattering into anything.

02:05:36.682 --> 02:05:38.335
MATT: From where? Out of the sewer, you mean?

02:05:38.335 --> 02:05:40.586
LIAM: Yeah, out of the sewer, yeah. I pop him back
up.

02:05:40.586 --> 02:05:44.675
MATT: As soon as Frumpkin-- He kicks and--

02:05:44.675 --> 02:05:46.325
(gasps)

02:05:46.325 --> 02:05:47.680
MATT: Misses.

02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:50.467
(laughter)

02:05:51.367 --> 02:05:54.639
SAM: It’s the same guy, it's the same guy!

02:05:58.544 --> 02:06:02.434
LIAM: Caleb appears at the sewer like Pennywise
the Clown.

02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:05.094
MARISHA: Why is that their natural response in
this town?

02:06:05.094 --> 02:06:10.220
MATT: Well, he got scared by the cat! The first
guy was a dick, this guy was (yells), like kicking

02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:15.188
wildly. Anyway. He falls back and Frumpkin runs
off. He’s like (grunts). It seems to be enough to

02:06:15.188 --> 02:06:22.129
take him off the scent of Nott, and he turns
around. “Miss?” He walks up and helps you up.

02:06:22.129 --> 02:06:25.212
LAURA: Oh, it was my spit. I was choking on my own
spit.

02:06:25.212 --> 02:06:27.975
MATT: Right, all right. Well, go get your candy.
Have a good night.

02:06:27.975 --> 02:06:29.910
LAURA: Thank you very much for all of your help.

02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:36.462
MATT: (sighs) He goes back to his post. You guys
make your way through the sewer, back up through

02:06:36.462 --> 02:06:37.985
the T-intersection--

02:06:37.985 --> 02:06:40.501
TRAVIS: Mindful of the damn rats.

02:06:40.501 --> 02:06:42.331
MARISHA: Rat-balloons.

02:06:42.521 --> 02:06:45.944
LIAM: I held back two minutes to let Frumpkin
quietly come back.

02:06:45.944 --> 02:06:49.777
MATT: All right. Fair enough. Frumpkin does slowly
make his way back to join you. You make your way

02:06:49.777 --> 02:06:54.868
towards the gate and, without issue, are entered
into the Tri-Spire. You make your way towards the

02:06:54.868 --> 02:06:56.938
side of the alleyway where the--

02:06:57.036 --> 02:06:59.380
LAURA: Oh, we didn’t meet the guy at the Song and
Supper.

02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:00.976
MATT: You did not.

02:07:00.976 --> 02:07:02.658
MARISHA: Oh fuck!

02:07:02.658 --> 02:07:04.419
SAM: What guy?

02:07:04.419 --> 02:07:07.672
MARISHA: Shit! We were supposed to go fucking meet
Ulog! Damn it!

02:07:07.672 --> 02:07:09.124
TALIESIN: We’re so good at this.

02:07:09.124 --> 02:07:10.465
MATT: Jester, do you want to go do that?

02:07:10.465 --> 02:07:12.971
LAURA: Yeah, I just remembered it. I’m going to
the Song and Supper Inn.

02:07:12.971 --> 02:07:15.452
TALIESIN: We’re going to sit in the sewer like so
much clown.

02:07:15.452 --> 02:07:18.994
MARISHA: We recapped this at the break, too! Damn
it!

02:07:18.994 --> 02:07:23.622
MATT: You guys are sitting there, waiting for
Jester to show up and meet you to let you out.

02:07:23.622 --> 02:07:27.237
SAM: I cast Message a few times. We’re here. Where
are you?

02:07:27.237 --> 02:07:29.748
TRAVIS: Where letter-R letter-U?

02:07:29.748 --> 02:07:35.234
MATT: You, however, you make your way to the Song
and Supper, and on the inside, you can see,

02:07:35.234 --> 02:07:42.562
nervously at a table, in a dark cloak, Ulog. “What
the--?” Gets up and meets you outside, shoves you

02:07:42.562 --> 02:07:47.302
back out there and you both begin to walk
side-by-side. “I was waiting here long enough!”

02:07:47.302 --> 02:07:52.258
LAURA: We were waiting for you! It’s so weird that
we totally missed you, though.

02:07:52.258 --> 02:07:54.455
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:07:58.653 --> 02:08:01.088
LAURA: Well, well, well, 11.

02:08:01.185 --> 02:08:05.445
MATT: He goes, “Right. Well, where’s the rest of
your team?”

02:08:05.445 --> 02:08:11.682
LAURA: They are-- Here’s the thing. How rich do
you look? How rich does he look?

02:08:11.682 --> 02:08:19.422
MATT: He looks down and he has fairly plain dark
clothing for night-stealthing. He has like a

02:08:19.422 --> 02:08:25.335
single-- looks like a gold chain of some kind with
a single yellowish amber-orange bead on it that

02:08:25.335 --> 02:08:34.239
looks like it’s worth a gold or two. Dark
green-brown cloak. It’s hard to see the color,

02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:37.124
this late at night. He doesn’t look super rich.

02:08:37.124 --> 02:08:39.596
LAURA: Can I put some of my costume on him?

02:08:39.596 --> 02:08:40.915
MATT: Yeah.

02:08:40.915 --> 02:08:42.863
LAURA: I’ll put some of my festive wear on him.

02:08:42.863 --> 02:08:45.332
MATT: You put some of the festive wear on him.
It’s all not at all fitted for him and it looks

02:08:45.332 --> 02:08:52.166
like a kid who has outgrown his snow-outfit and
he’s like-- “This is humiliating.”

02:08:52.166 --> 02:08:55.487
LAURA: It’ll get you in the door, don’t worry.
Here, put this mask on.

02:08:55.487 --> 02:08:59.978
MATT: He’s seething beneath it. You can see him
grinding his teeth, but he follows you

02:08:59.978 --> 02:09:01.092
nevertheless.

02:09:01.092 --> 02:09:02.326
TALIESIN: Candy-themed, too.

02:09:02.326 --> 02:09:04.289
LAURA: Oh, that’s great!

02:09:04.289 --> 02:09:10.981
MATT: You make your way to the gate once more. The
guards there-- One of them walks up and, the same

02:09:10.981 --> 02:09:15.092
one from earlier, gives you a nod. “Hold.”

02:09:15.092 --> 02:09:18.805
LAURA: Guest of honor for the night. He’s a
comedian.

02:09:18.805 --> 02:09:21.110
MATT: Make another deception check.

02:09:23.939 --> 02:09:29.165
LAURA: Come on! It is being so mean! Seven. God
damn it.

02:09:29.165 --> 02:09:33.946
MATT: He goes, “A comedian. Tell me a joke.”

02:09:33.946 --> 02:09:36.084
MARISHA: Oh, come on, Ulog!

02:09:36.084 --> 02:09:40.347
MATT: Ulog looks at you with the mask, back at the
guard. “Um--”

02:09:40.347 --> 02:09:44.236
MARISHA: It’s open mic night! You got this!

02:09:44.236 --> 02:09:47.719
(laughter)

02:09:48.356 --> 02:09:56.868
MATT: He goes, “What do you call the king on his
birthday?” The crownsguard goes, “I don’t know.

02:09:56.868 --> 02:10:03.021
What do you call a king on his birthday?” “An
arsehole.” The guard goes--

02:10:05.691 --> 02:10:11.089
LAURA: Here’s the thing. He’s not a joke-telling
kind of comedian. He’s more of a farce kind of

02:10:11.166 --> 02:10:21.162
comedian. Physical comedy. It’s more like a
jester, if you will. And I push him and-- so he

02:10:21.162 --> 02:10:23.225
falls down. See?

02:10:24.113 --> 02:10:28.039
MATT: (impact noise) At which point the two guards
go:

02:10:28.039 --> 02:10:29.659
(laugh)

02:10:29.659 --> 02:10:32.691
LAURA: He’s so good. He really sells it.

02:10:33.474 --> 02:10:41.442
MATT: Ulog like gets off the ground and glares at
you this very furious fiery stare and then gets up

02:10:41.442 --> 02:10:46.442
and then stumbles again and falls on the ground,
flat again. The guard goes,

02:10:46.442 --> 02:10:48.982
"(laughs) All right, get in."

02:10:48.982 --> 02:10:56.161
Ulog now has like a bloody nose and as you
ushers him in, he looks back. “Oh, we’re going to

02:10:56.161 --> 02:10:57.444
talk later.”

02:10:57.564 --> 02:10:59.969
LAURA: But I got you in the door, right?

02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:07.386
MATT: You eventually make your way over to the
edge of the alley, coming up to the hatch that

02:11:07.386 --> 02:11:13.380
leads you out of the sewer. There you guys see the
two approaching shapes of Jester and Ulog. Ulog

02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:18.301
looking festive, if the wear is a bit tiny, making
his hair and beard poof out of the sides of

02:11:18.301 --> 02:11:19.971
the mask.

02:11:19.971 --> 02:11:22.098
MARISHA: (pigeon coos)

02:11:22.198 --> 02:11:23.622
SAM: Where have you been?

02:11:23.622 --> 02:11:25.012
LAURA: I got Ulog.

02:11:25.012 --> 02:11:27.542
MARISHA: Oh shit! We almost forgot about Ulog!

02:11:27.542 --> 02:11:28.590
LAURA: I know!

02:11:28.590 --> 02:11:29.696
MARISHA: Oh shit!

02:11:29.696 --> 02:11:30.817
SAM: What’s Ulog’s job in this?

02:11:30.817 --> 02:11:34.388
LAURA: I have no freaking clue! Hey Ulog, what do
you want to do?

02:11:34.388 --> 02:11:42.978
MATT: “Well, first off, I’m pretty keen at
infiltration. I have a long past of doing sort of

02:11:42.978 --> 02:11:50.623
the breaking and entering thing. Plus, I want to
be there when this happens. Have a personal stake."

02:11:50.928 --> 02:11:53.698
TRAVIS: Yeah, he should be a part of the team that
goes in.

02:11:53.698 --> 02:11:54.642
LAURA: Okay.

02:11:54.642 --> 02:11:57.390
MARISHA: How well do you know Lord Sutan’s place
and the area?

02:11:57.390 --> 02:11:59.165
MATT: “I know the area alright.”

02:11:59.165 --> 02:12:00.653
MARISHA: All right.

02:12:00.653 --> 02:12:02.512
LAURA: We cased it earlier.

02:12:02.512 --> 02:12:04.209
MATT: “Do you think you know where he lives?”

02:12:04.209 --> 02:12:05.246
LAURA: Yes.

02:12:05.246 --> 02:12:08.411
MATT: “All right. That’s all we need. The rest we
can all do. Lead on.”

02:12:08.856 --> 02:12:11.206
LIAM: Can I insight check him? Just get a feel for
that.

02:12:11.206 --> 02:12:12.455
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

02:12:13.839 --> 02:12:15.390
LIAM: That is 17.

02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:16.783
MATT: 17.

02:12:16.783 --> 02:12:19.794
SAM: Whispers! Whispers!

02:12:19.794 --> 02:12:22.934
TALIESIN: Mysterious whispers!

02:12:22.934 --> 02:12:24.376
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond!

02:12:24.376 --> 02:12:25.624
TRAVIS: And Far Cry 5!

02:12:25.624 --> 02:12:26.964
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:12:26.964 --> 02:12:30.146
SAM: Far Cry 5! It’s five better than Far Cry 0.

02:12:30.876 --> 02:12:33.507
TRAVIS: Or four better than the original.

02:12:33.594 --> 02:12:35.036
MARISHA: The fiviest.

02:12:35.036 --> 02:12:36.121
SAM: Yes.

02:12:36.121 --> 02:12:38.566
TRAVIS: Takes place in America.

02:12:38.566 --> 02:12:40.544
SAM: Montana.

02:12:41.594 --> 02:12:43.214
LIAM: Guys, it’s Larkin.

02:12:45.825 --> 02:12:54.140
MATT: Well there goes the campaign. As you guys
make your way through the city streets, you can

02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:59.833
see the closer you get to the Silken Terrace, for
one, the usual silk banners that adorn the various

02:12:59.833 --> 02:13:04.460
edges of the streets have been changed from the
usual white silk banners to bright yellows, bright

02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:12.990
browns, bright reds. The colors of autumn are now
starting to show and appear throughout the vicinity.

02:13:13.144 --> 02:13:14.656
MARISHA: I hate the color yellow.

02:13:14.656 --> 02:13:16.422
TRAVIS: Really? Why?

02:13:16.422 --> 02:13:18.293
MARISHA: I just hate it.

02:13:18.293 --> 02:13:20.057
LAURA: It would look really pretty on you.

02:13:20.057 --> 02:13:22.835
TALIESIN: I don’t think that’s true.

02:13:22.835 --> 02:13:24.511
SAM: No, I don’t think so.

02:13:24.511 --> 02:13:26.097
LAURA: I think yellow would look good on you.

02:13:26.097 --> 02:13:27.772
TALIESIN: The blue works. Stick with it, you
know.

02:13:27.772 --> 02:13:29.228
SAM: More of a spring…

02:13:29.349 --> 02:13:34.266
MATT: You also hear the music begin to swell at
the various performing bands towards the center

02:13:34.266 --> 02:13:39.997
where this gala is. You can see all the banners
leaning in the center space. The sunset colors

02:13:39.997 --> 02:13:45.673
have vanished and now the night sky holds above.
The Crownsguard are clustered in greater numbers

02:13:45.673 --> 02:13:50.871
in the Tri-Spire, specifically to keep a perimeter
around the event. As you glance off to the

02:13:50.871 --> 02:13:54.832
entrance gate where you were, you can see there’s
now stationed more towards that space, since you

02:13:54.832 --> 02:14:02.530
originally passed through. More musicians are
arriving, some locally, some appear to be from

02:14:02.530 --> 02:14:07.966
other areas within the actual Empire. The social
elite are gathering in the center of the Silken

02:14:07.966 --> 02:14:12.403
Terrace and you can now see the small carriages
are stopping and letting other individuals out to

02:14:12.403 --> 02:14:17.538
join the crowds, the mingling beginning. You can
already see about 60 or 70 people, with more still

02:14:17.538 --> 02:14:21.744
arriving. They all have their various colors and
masks on. They’re all grabbing drinks and laughing

02:14:21.744 --> 02:14:26.411
and seeing old friends and introducing themselves
to new people they haven’t met before. Some of

02:14:26.411 --> 02:14:29.129
them live in the Tri-Spire, some that live
throughout and beyond.

02:14:29.129 --> 02:14:30.582
MARISHA: Any of them look familiar?

02:14:30.582 --> 02:14:32.205
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:14:32.974 --> 02:14:36.568
MARISHA: Don’t fuck me, Gil! Meh, you kind of
fucked me there.

02:14:36.568 --> 02:14:38.138
LIAM: May I also do the same thing?

02:14:38.138 --> 02:14:39.258
MARISHA: Ten.

02:14:39.258 --> 02:14:41.004
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:14:41.457 --> 02:14:43.526
LIAM: No, no good. Eight.

02:14:43.526 --> 02:14:47.218
MATT: Unfortunately, you’re too far away and the
masks obscure any of sort of details. You’re

02:14:47.218 --> 02:14:51.539
unable to see anyone you recognize, per se. But
you do see that there are long tables that mark

02:14:51.539 --> 02:14:57.511
the perimeter that are already holding already
preset glasses of wine and ciders. You can see the

02:14:57.511 --> 02:15:03.790
central tower of the Triumph Chime sits glowing
right at the front and center of this gala. It’s

02:15:03.790 --> 02:15:09.585
all surrounding the base of it. And up in a spiral
you can see lanterns and similar colors of

02:15:09.585 --> 02:15:15.826
autumn that spiral up the front of it. You guys
begin to, carefully, and out of sight, make your

02:15:15.983 --> 02:15:20.350
way towards the estate of Lord Sutan. Please make
stealth checks, everybody.

02:15:20.350 --> 02:15:22.771
LIAM: This is a lot of people.

02:15:24.203 --> 02:15:25.817
LAURA: Oh wait. Who sucks?

02:15:25.817 --> 02:15:27.005
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:15:27.005 --> 02:15:28.219
LIAM: I rolled well.

02:15:28.219 --> 02:15:30.464
LAURA: Who hasn’t rolled yet? Taliesin I give you
a blessing.

02:15:30.464 --> 02:15:35.707
TALIESIN: All right. Advantage. That’s awesome.

02:15:36.346 --> 02:15:37.384
TRAVIS: 14.

02:15:37.384 --> 02:15:39.795
MARISHA: Why does it feel like you roll crappier
when you’re lower level? 13.

02:15:39.795 --> 02:15:40.589
LIAM: 17.

02:15:40.589 --> 02:15:41.560
SAM: 13.

02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:42.495
LAURA: 20.

02:15:42.495 --> 02:15:43.365
TALIESIN: 19.

02:15:43.365 --> 02:15:44.409
TRAVIS: Uh!

02:15:44.409 --> 02:15:49.587
MATT: Pretty good spread. You guys duck in
between, avoiding being seen and blend in with the

02:15:49.587 --> 02:15:56.910
crowd as you pass other individuals that are
making their way to the actual Gala event. There

02:15:56.910 --> 02:16:02.081
are nods and smiles, occasional laugh, as folks
are conversing and chatting as they pass. You make

02:16:02.081 --> 02:16:08.682
your way over to the outskirts of the Gilded
Willows, beyond the Skyscape Park and where the

02:16:08.682 --> 02:16:14.692
Constellation Bridge tower stands, to see, for
many of you the first time, the three-story dark

02:16:14.692 --> 02:16:24.174
wood home of Lord Sutan. The marble pillars mark
the cornerstones of where the metallic iron fence

02:16:24.174 --> 02:16:29.713
gate matches the perimeter. There’s a singular
tree and still there are two guards posted at one

02:16:29.713 --> 02:16:32.487
and the same guard with the dog at the other.

02:16:32.487 --> 02:16:34.137
MARISHA: Same guard.

02:16:34.137 --> 02:16:35.534
SAM: Must be getting tired.

02:16:35.534 --> 02:16:39.022
LIAM: I’m sorry. Can you set the scene? Two guards
at one end and one at the other?

02:16:39.022 --> 02:16:40.717
MATT: Well it’s been a day later.

02:16:40.717 --> 02:16:44.231
MARISHA: Are we catching them around the same
time? This is his shift. Same watch.

02:16:44.231 --> 02:16:45.629
MATT: Seems to be.

02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:46.853
MARISHA: All right.

02:16:46.853 --> 02:16:48.960
LIAM: And it’s like corner-corner or front and
back or…?

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:53.178
MATT: If look at the-- if the building’s a square.
The house is mainly built as a rectangle, there’s

02:16:53.191 --> 02:16:57.163
the front door and the back where the
cellar door is and there’s the perimeter fence.

02:16:57.163 --> 02:16:58.198
LIAM: Okay.

02:16:58.198 --> 02:17:01.510
MATT: In the front, there are two guards. In the
back, where the gate and the cellar door is,

02:17:01.510 --> 02:17:06.111
there’s a singular guard and his dog. The tree is
up on this side.

02:17:06.111 --> 02:17:08.090
LAURA: But there’s still a gate--

02:17:08.090 --> 02:17:11.294
MARISHA: All the way around. With the spikes.

02:17:11.294 --> 02:17:14.472
LIAM: The guard with the dog is within this
perimeter of fence?

02:17:14.472 --> 02:17:17.931
MATT: It’s just on the interior of it. Just within the
gate.

02:17:17.931 --> 02:17:19.199
MARISHA: And the gate is closed.

02:17:19.199 --> 02:17:20.062
MATT: Correct.

02:17:24.499 --> 02:17:28.448
LAURA: How wide are the openings in the gate? Does
it look like the mastiff could get through the

02:17:28.532 --> 02:17:30.375
openings in the wrought-iron fence?

02:17:30.375 --> 02:17:31.961
MATT: Probably not, no.

02:17:32.314 --> 02:17:35.305
MARISHA: But he can still be enough of a
distraction to get the guard to chase the dog

02:17:35.305 --> 02:17:37.414
while we get in if we can get the dog--

02:17:37.414 --> 02:17:39.105
LIAM: To the front side of the home.

02:17:39.105 --> 02:17:40.567
MARISHA: Maybe to the front side.

02:17:40.567 --> 02:17:42.203
LIAM: Maybe temporary though.

02:17:42.289 --> 02:17:45.764
SAM: We can get in through the gate and then we
get to the tree or we’re going to go straight into

02:17:45.764 --> 02:17:47.125
the cellar?

02:17:47.125 --> 02:17:49.733
MARISHA: That’s what I was thinking. Go into the
cellar.

02:17:49.733 --> 02:17:54.786
LAURA: We could use the tree to get over the fence
and then run to the cellar.

02:17:54.786 --> 02:17:58.065
MARISHA: As soon as the dog chases away the cat.

02:17:58.065 --> 02:18:01.952
LIAM: Yeah, but what about our exit? Because we
have to come back out.

02:18:01.952 --> 02:18:03.091
MARISHA: Well--

02:18:03.091 --> 02:18:04.626
SAM: We worry about that later?

02:18:04.626 --> 02:18:06.611
LIAM: No, no, we worry about that now.

02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:08.770
MARISHA: Maybe that’s when Fjord can come and
relieve the guards?

02:18:09.139 --> 02:18:10.639
TRAVIS: I can do that now.

02:18:10.639 --> 02:18:15.096
MARISHA: Or he can do that now. But how do we get
Fjord on the other side of the gate?

02:18:15.885 --> 02:18:18.130
LAURA: He walks up to him and say--

02:18:18.130 --> 02:18:23.783
SAM: That’s very risky now because what if the
guards says “I don’t know you,” you know? Then the

02:18:23.783 --> 02:18:29.202
plan never starts. If we do that at the end, at
least we have a fighting chance.

02:18:29.202 --> 02:18:31.581
TRAVIS: That’s true. I could wait.

02:18:31.581 --> 02:18:33.854
LIAM: I don’t like being stuck in there though.

02:18:33.854 --> 02:18:36.500
LAURA: Ulog? What do you think? You’re really good
at this.

02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:38.228
MATT: “Who’s staying outside?”

02:18:38.228 --> 02:18:38.923
TRAVIS: I am.

02:18:38.923 --> 02:18:39.880
TALIESIN: I am.

02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:42.610
MATT: The two of you. All right.

02:18:43.129 --> 02:18:46.167
MARISHA: What were those guards’ names? There were
so many guards.

02:18:46.167 --> 02:18:47.831
TALIESIN: What <i>were</i> those guards’ names?

02:18:47.831 --> 02:18:49.502
LAURA: That was at the High-Richter’s house. That
wasn’t here.

02:18:49.502 --> 02:18:50.872
TRAVIS: Yeah that was at the High-Richter’s.

02:18:50.872 --> 02:18:54.010
MARISHA: Yeah, but as long as you do a guard
that’s semi-recognizable.

02:18:54.010 --> 02:19:00.330
MATT: “If we can manage, if what you’re saying
about this tree, we can possibly scoot past their

02:19:00.330 --> 02:19:04.526
visual range and not have to worry about it. And
just use that as a backup.”

02:19:04.526 --> 02:19:06.235
LAURA: Right.

02:19:06.235 --> 02:19:08.208
MATT: “But we got to climb the tree.”

02:19:08.208 --> 02:19:10.968
LAURA: We can climb a tree. We’re good at that.

02:19:10.968 --> 02:19:12.771
TRAVIS: The tree means worst case scenario.

02:19:12.854 --> 02:19:17.082
LAURA: And I got this grapple, so we can swing
across to the roof on the other side.

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:21.032
MATT: “All right. Those that are staying at the
base. The rest of us, let’s get to climbing.”

02:19:21.032 --> 02:19:23.287
TALIESIN: If we hear the dog bark, we can walk
by.

02:19:23.287 --> 02:19:29.600
LIAM: Also, I have another question. How far from
the fence to the home?

02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:30.997
MATT: It’s about five feet.

02:19:30.997 --> 02:19:32.561
LIAM: Five feet only.

02:19:32.561 --> 02:19:34.662
MARISHA: Yeah, but spikes.

02:19:34.662 --> 02:19:39.128
LIAM: I’m rethinking. If Frumpkin gets away from
this dog in the beginning, he can run outside the

02:19:39.128 --> 02:19:45.780
fence and he will not be far from me. I can stay
in touch with him, so when it’s time to leave I

02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:49.743
can have Frumpkin reenter the yard and create
mayhem a second time.

02:19:49.743 --> 02:19:53.341
LAURA: Or let him create it the first time,
because we might not need it.

02:19:53.341 --> 02:19:56.811
LIAM: We might not, but if we have no other option
and we’re trying to get out and there’s guards in

02:19:56.811 --> 02:20:01.855
both places, Frumpkin can come in and create
mayhem again. Anyway, just an option.

02:20:01.855 --> 02:20:03.487
SAM: Okay.

02:20:03.487 --> 02:20:08.141
MATT: "We get to the top, you use your little cat
thing to distract it. Preferably the other side of

02:20:08.141 --> 02:20:09.338
the fence."

02:20:09.338 --> 02:20:10.848
LIAM: He's just a cat.

02:20:10.848 --> 02:20:14.604
MATT: "Right. Your cat. On the other side of the
fence. While they're faced and focused in that

02:20:14.604 --> 02:20:16.831
direction, we make our ascent."

02:20:16.831 --> 02:20:21.088
LAURA: We swing it over. Somebody needs to make a
loud noise when we throw the grapple over.

02:20:21.088 --> 02:20:23.456
SAM: You can cough or something.

02:20:23.456 --> 02:20:26.104
LAURA: So that it doesn't make a clang sound that
they hear.

02:20:26.104 --> 02:20:28.327
MATT: "That might be on one of you."

02:20:28.327 --> 02:20:30.092
LIAM: A natural sound.

02:20:30.092 --> 02:20:31.350
MATT: "All right."

02:20:31.350 --> 02:20:33.880
SAM: I will signal you when we are grapple
throwing.

02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:35.064
MARISHA: All right.

02:20:35.064 --> 02:20:37.889
TALIESIN: If you also hear me make the same sound
again, that means trouble.

02:20:37.889 --> 02:20:40.660
LAURA: I could maybe use, like, Thaumaturgy to
create a thunder sound.

02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:41.726
SAM: Ooh, that's good.

02:20:41.726 --> 02:20:43.340
LAURA: If it happens at the same time.

02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:44.976
MATT: "Actually not a bad idea."

02:20:44.976 --> 02:20:46.388
LAURA: Okay, I'll do that.

02:20:46.388 --> 02:20:48.893
LIAM: How's the weather; is it clear or grey?

02:20:48.951 --> 02:20:50.718
LAURA: Sometimes thunder happens out of nowhere.

02:20:50.718 --> 02:20:54.694
MATT: It's cloudy.The sky itself is cloudy, and
has been. Even though the storm blew by, it's

02:20:54.694 --> 02:20:56.741
still pretty heavy cloud cover.

02:20:56.741 --> 02:20:58.366
LAURA: Oh, good.

02:20:58.366 --> 02:21:00.043
MARISHA: All right. Up the tree!

02:21:00.043 --> 02:21:01.545
TALIESIN: If you hear me make noise--

02:21:01.545 --> 02:21:03.186
MATT: Those who are climbing the tree, athletics
checks please.

02:21:03.186 --> 02:21:06.545
MARISHA: I'll go first, so I can try and help
anyone else as I go up. Can I do that?

02:21:06.545 --> 02:21:08.689
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. So Beau goes first.

02:21:08.689 --> 02:21:10.987
MARISHA: Athletics or acrobatics?

02:21:10.987 --> 02:21:12.590
MATT: For climbing, we'll say athletics.

02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:13.966
MARISHA: (whimpers)

02:21:13.966 --> 02:21:15.605
MATT: It doesn't have a lot of branches.

02:21:15.605 --> 02:21:16.805
MARISHA: But parkour.

02:21:16.805 --> 02:21:18.565
LAURA: Do we get advantage because Beau's helping
us?

02:21:18.565 --> 02:21:20.073
MARISHA: That's not great--

02:21:20.073 --> 02:21:21.646
LIAM: Well, she's got to get up there first.

02:21:21.766 --> 02:21:23.702
MARISHA: I got to get up there.

02:21:23.702 --> 02:21:24.786
LIAM: She didn't roll that good.

02:21:24.786 --> 02:21:26.023
MARISHA: Eight.

02:21:26.023 --> 02:21:32.207
MATT: Eight? Well, you're not helping anybody.
(chuckles) You get partway up, and Ulog is

02:21:32.207 --> 02:21:35.319
actually, like (grunting). He's doing fine. So he
pushes you up the rest of the way.

02:21:35.319 --> 02:21:36.767
MARISHA: Give me a boost!

02:21:36.767 --> 02:21:37.847
LAURA: Shh!

02:21:37.847 --> 02:21:39.139
MARISHA: (whispers) Sorry!

02:21:39.139 --> 02:21:40.287
SAM: I rolled an 18.

02:21:40.287 --> 02:21:43.122
MATT: You climb up fine, skittering up past them.
You actually climb over Beau and Ulog to get to

02:21:43.122 --> 02:21:44.484
the top first.

02:21:44.484 --> 02:21:45.752
SAM: Watch my nails.

02:21:45.752 --> 02:21:46.745
LAURA: I rolled 11.

02:21:46.745 --> 02:21:49.266
MATT: 11? That's fine. You manage to get up there. 
And Caleb?

02:21:49.412 --> 02:21:50.396
LIAM: 17.

02:21:50.396 --> 02:21:51.357
SAM: Ooh.

02:21:51.357 --> 02:21:53.562
MATT: You guys all get up there. Beau is the last
to arrive.

02:21:53.562 --> 02:21:55.091
MARISHA: (pants)

02:21:55.091 --> 02:21:57.239
SAM: I thought you were a monk of some sort.

02:21:57.239 --> 02:22:00.580
MARISHA: I'm sprinter. I'm not an endurance
person. Okay?

02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:03.654
MATT: It's one if those things, too, where she
starts first, but each person keeps putting their

02:22:03.654 --> 02:22:05.865
feet in her face on the way up.

02:22:05.865 --> 02:22:08.688
SAM: You're all legs and no arms.

02:22:08.688 --> 02:22:10.962
MATT: Okay, you guys get up to the top of the
tree.

02:22:11.079 --> 02:22:13.617
You're up in the branches, in the bow, at
the top. You can see now, it's a beautiful view of

02:22:13.617 --> 02:22:16.988
the gala in the distance. You can see the three
towers, all arcing up, all lit from underneath

02:22:16.988 --> 02:22:21.111
from the lanterns and the light that have been
significantly brightened for the events of the

02:22:21.111 --> 02:22:25.780
evening. You have a clear shot of the rooftop,
which is at a slight decline from this current

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:31.787
position. It's about ten feet from you, and about
three feet down below. You can see there are two

02:22:31.787 --> 02:22:36.392
smokestacks that look like they're attached to
fire places that might be good indicators of

02:22:36.392 --> 02:22:39.731
places to connect the rope. Who's throwing the
rope?

02:22:39.731 --> 02:22:41.043
LAURA: Should I try it?

02:22:41.043 --> 02:22:42.218
MARISHA: You're strongest.

02:22:42.218 --> 02:22:43.762
SAM: What is this? Why do--?

02:22:43.762 --> 02:22:45.895
LAURA: It's a grapple. Connected to a rope.

02:22:45.895 --> 02:22:46.845
SAM: All right.

02:22:46.845 --> 02:22:51.110
LAURA: So I hand the other side of the rope to
Ulog so it doesn't fall.

02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:54.253
MATT: He takes it. He's like, "All right. You got
to be pretty good at aiming this."

02:22:54.253 --> 02:22:55.547
SAM: Yeah, are you?

02:22:55.547 --> 02:22:57.748
MATT: "It's about 15, 20 feet from here."

02:22:57.748 --> 02:22:59.493
LAURA: Well, I'm strong.

02:22:59.493 --> 02:23:01.339
MATT: "But can you aim it?"

02:23:03.079 --> 02:23:05.440
LAURA: Yeah, but you're weak, aren't you?

02:23:05.593 --> 02:23:10.527
SAM: I don't know. I feel like I'm more precise
than you. But, no, you're strong. You go for it.

02:23:10.527 --> 02:23:11.993
LAURA: No, but you're precise.

02:23:11.993 --> 02:23:13.107
SAM: I don't--

02:23:13.107 --> 02:23:16.095
LIAM: Frumpkin is pacing back and forth just
outside the fence.

02:23:16.095 --> 02:23:18.682
SAM: Parchment, boulder, shears?

02:23:18.682 --> 02:23:20.420
LAURA: Yeah. On three?

02:23:20.420 --> 02:23:23.495
SAM: Yes, on three. One. Two. Three! Okay, you're
throwing it.

02:23:23.495 --> 02:23:24.701
LAURA: Okay, I'll throw it.

02:23:24.701 --> 02:23:28.834
MATT: So go ahead and roll a d20 and add your
strength modifier.

02:23:28.834 --> 02:23:30.076
SAM: Ooh, strength.

02:23:30.076 --> 02:23:31.899
LAURA: Oh, that was good, okay.

02:23:35.643 --> 02:23:39.286
11. No! 12.

02:23:39.286 --> 02:23:43.019
MATT: You throw it. Tink, tink.

02:23:43.019 --> 02:23:45.434
LAURA: Thunder, thunder! When I did it.

02:23:45.434 --> 02:23:49.935
MATT: Okay. There's this roll of thunder off in
the distance. It didn't catch anything, though,

02:23:49.935 --> 02:23:53.556
and it's scraping. Pulling back a little bit--

02:23:53.556 --> 02:23:55.707
LAURA: More thunder. Another thunder.

02:23:55.707 --> 02:23:57.675
SAM: It's not staying on?

02:23:57.675 --> 02:24:01.650
MATT: It didn't manage to. It got over to the
roof, but it didn't catch anything.

02:24:01.650 --> 02:24:02.538
MARISHA: Oh, god.

02:24:02.538 --> 02:24:04.322
SAM: Reel it back in. Reel it back in!

02:24:04.322 --> 02:24:06.171
MARISHA: Don't let it get caught.

02:24:06.315 --> 02:24:09.709
LAURA: I do another thunder sound right when I
pull it, so it doesn't make noise.

02:24:09.709 --> 02:24:12.848
MATT: Okay. So you pull it and it scrapes, falls,
and then dangles down. You manage to pull it up a

02:24:12.848 --> 02:24:14.675
little bit, dangle it up, yeah.

02:24:14.675 --> 02:24:16.442
SAM: Give me that. Give me that!

02:24:16.442 --> 02:24:18.576
LAURA: Here! It is a strength thing, though.

02:24:18.576 --> 02:24:19.932
SAM: (squeaks)

02:24:19.932 --> 02:24:21.440
MATT: Are you just throwing it?

02:24:21.533 --> 02:24:22.857
SAM: Yes. Natural one.

02:24:22.857 --> 02:24:24.441
(laughter)

02:24:24.441 --> 02:24:28.991
MATT: All right. So.

02:24:28.991 --> 02:24:31.837
SAM: We've lost our grapple.

02:24:31.837 --> 02:24:34.453
LAURA: No. No, Ulog was holding 
onto the end of it.

02:24:34.453 --> 02:24:40.218
MATT: He was holding the other side of it. The
grapple arcs up really high, and arcs past.

02:24:40.218 --> 02:24:45.107
There's a brief moment where you see it go up, and
then pass by you, heading down towards the wall.

02:24:45.107 --> 02:24:46.598
Is anyone going to do anything?

02:24:46.598 --> 02:24:49.184
LAURA: I catch-- I try to catch the rope to try to
keep it from hitting the ground.

02:24:49.184 --> 02:24:50.588
MATT: You could try.

02:24:50.588 --> 02:24:52.946
SAM: Oh boy. Try!

02:24:52.946 --> 02:24:54.357
LAURA: I'll try.

02:24:54.357 --> 02:24:55.558
MARISHA: I don't know what to do!

02:24:55.558 --> 02:24:56.909
LAURA: I did; I tried!

02:24:56.909 --> 02:24:58.366
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

02:24:58.366 --> 02:25:01.910
MARISHA: Is it flying out of our grasp; 
is that what’s happening?

02:25:02.119 --> 02:25:04.478
MATT: It looks like it’s just out of the grasp.
She's going to try, so go ahead and roll a d20.

02:25:04.478 --> 02:25:06.520
MARISHA: She's going to try and catch it.

02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:08.488
LAURA: I rolled a 19. I don't know what I'm
adding.

02:25:08.571 --> 02:25:11.144
MATT: Yeah. That's fine. So you manage to just
catch it, holding onto the edge of the rope,

02:25:11.144 --> 02:25:15.012
before it clanks onto the ground. It's just
dangling now.

02:25:15.012 --> 02:25:16.343
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:25:16.343 --> 02:25:18.030
MATT: You pull it slowly back up.

02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:19.319
MARISHA: Wait.

02:25:19.319 --> 02:25:23.104
SAM: You said strength. I threw it as hard as I
could throw it.

02:25:23.104 --> 02:25:24.470
MARISHA: Quiet, shut up!

02:25:24.470 --> 02:25:26.471
SAM: Thunder!

02:25:26.471 --> 02:25:33.246
MARISHA: (whispers) Okay, maybe if I get over, I
could hold the other end and help people.

02:25:33.246 --> 02:25:35.296
LAURA: You can jump ten feet?

02:25:35.296 --> 02:25:36.829
MARISHA: I think I can.

02:25:36.922 --> 02:25:41.322
LAURA: Oh, dear lord. What if you fall on the
ground, Beau?

02:25:41.322 --> 02:25:43.015
TRAVIS: Let this happen. Let this happen.

02:25:43.015 --> 02:25:45.208
MARISHA: Look, we're basically gods, okay?

02:25:45.208 --> 02:25:47.852
(laughter)

02:25:47.852 --> 02:25:49.999
MARISHA: I can make this jump.

02:25:49.999 --> 02:25:51.033
MATT: You going to try?

02:25:51.033 --> 02:25:55.455
MARISHA: I'm going to cast step of the wind--
Sorry, not cast it. I'm going to use a ki point.

02:25:55.455 --> 02:26:05.109
I'm going to take a breath, gather my
chi. Along the edge of the branch anime run--

02:26:05.784 --> 02:26:11.022
MATT: Okay. And leap. Make an athletics check.
I'll give you advantage because of the step of the wind.

02:26:11.022 --> 02:26:15.363
MARISHA: Step of the wind gives me, like, double
jump distance, or triple jump--dump jist--

02:26:15.363 --> 02:26:17.787
SAM: Triple dump!

02:26:17.787 --> 02:26:19.626
TRAVIS: Triple dungeness crabs.

02:26:19.626 --> 02:26:23.102
TALIESIN: Oh, we had ring of truth cast. You can't
lie.

02:26:23.102 --> 02:26:25.011
SAM: Taliesin did a triple dump earlier.

02:26:25.011 --> 02:26:26.918
TALIESIN: I did. Solid.

02:26:26.918 --> 02:26:28.505
MARISHA: Hang on.

02:26:28.505 --> 02:26:30.245
MATT: Your jump distance is doubled! Yeah, you're
fine.

02:26:30.245 --> 02:26:31.773
MARISHA: (victorious laughter)

02:26:31.773 --> 02:26:32.757
MATT: You're fine.

02:26:32.757 --> 02:26:33.907
LAURA: Yeah!

02:26:33.907 --> 02:26:36.060
MATT: Just roll for the hell of it. I just want to
see what happens.

02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:37.928
LAURA: Just so it's not a one. No ones!

02:26:37.928 --> 02:26:39.158
SAM: It won't be a one.

02:26:39.158 --> 02:26:40.929
MARISHA: I don't trust Gil right now. I'm not
going to trust Gil.

02:26:40.929 --> 02:26:42.545
I'm going to go with cobalt die.

02:26:42.676 --> 02:26:43.708
Natural 18.

02:26:43.708 --> 02:26:48.785
MATT: You, off the branch, leap. No sound.

02:26:48.785 --> 02:26:52.448
MARISHA: I go along the rope, and tighten the rope
as I land.

02:26:52.448 --> 02:26:55.815
LAURA: The rope's not-- Oh, were you holding onto
the grapple?

02:26:55.815 --> 02:26:57.067
TALIESIN: She's got the other end.

02:26:57.067 --> 02:26:59.055
MARISHA: I was, like, tracing the rope.

02:26:59.055 --> 02:27:02.003
MATT: You grab it, affix it easily to one of the
smokestacks you find up there.

02:27:02.003 --> 02:27:03.361
LIAM: She is really cool.

02:27:03.361 --> 02:27:04.451
MATT: All right.

02:27:04.451 --> 02:27:05.698
SAM: She's amazing.

02:27:05.698 --> 02:27:07.403
LAURA: Great. So we'll tie off the other side--
Yeah.

02:27:07.403 --> 02:27:09.705
MATT: Ulog takes it and ties the other side of the
rope. You guys can all begin to shimmy across and

02:27:09.705 --> 02:27:10.658
make your way.

02:27:10.658 --> 02:27:12.267
LAURA: (whispers) We shimmy.

02:27:13.358 --> 02:27:20.029
MATT: So. The rope is set up. Are you guys just
going to shimmy across?

02:27:20.029 --> 02:27:21.038
SAM: Sure.

02:27:21.038 --> 02:27:22.420
MARISHA: When do we do the cat?

02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:24.836
SAM: Oh wait, do we have to cast-- Do we have to
have a-- Distraction!

02:27:24.836 --> 02:27:26.042
MARISHA: The cat.

02:27:26.042 --> 02:27:28.315
SAM: Oh, we're going to shimmy across. Because
what if the guard looks up and sees us?

02:27:28.315 --> 02:27:31.631
LIAM: Only, Frumpkin is down at the bottom of the
tree. He runs around and--

02:27:31.631 --> 02:27:32.919
SAM: So we do that now!

02:27:32.919 --> 02:27:34.076
LIAM: Yeah. I think--

02:27:34.076 --> 02:27:35.288
LAURA: Well, we do that--

02:27:35.288 --> 02:27:36.335
SAM: Now!

02:27:36.335 --> 02:27:37.707
LAURA: When we lower into the cellar, right
when--

02:27:37.707 --> 02:27:39.814
SAM: No, we're going through the roof now, I
thought. No?

02:27:39.814 --> 02:27:41.002
LAURA: Well how--?

02:27:41.002 --> 02:27:42.957
LIAM: Wait, hold on. Is there entry through the
roof?

02:27:42.957 --> 02:27:44.627
MATT: You're not there. You can't see it from
here.

02:27:44.627 --> 02:27:45.645
LIAM: We can't see from here?

02:27:45.645 --> 02:27:46.763
MARISHA: There is a chimney stack, though, right?

02:27:46.763 --> 02:27:48.851
LIAM: A chimney stack?
We're not Santa Claus!

02:27:48.851 --> 02:27:50.003
TRAVIS: We are now.

02:27:50.058 --> 02:27:51.609
(laughter)

02:27:51.609 --> 02:27:56.130
LAURA: Is there a door on the roof? How would
there be a stupid door on the roof?

02:27:56.130 --> 02:27:57.085
SAM: There could be.

02:27:57.085 --> 02:27:59.146
TALIESIN: Sometimes there's balconies.

02:27:59.195 --> 02:28:00.391
LAURA: There's no balconies.

02:28:00.391 --> 02:28:01.877
MATT: There's no balconies on this house.

02:28:01.877 --> 02:28:03.510
SAM: Look around for a door on the roof!

02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:05.389
MARISHA: What? Who would have a door on the roof?

02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:06.652
SAM: Rich people.

02:28:06.652 --> 02:28:08.359
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:28:08.359 --> 02:28:10.027
MARISHA: I look around. Is there a door on the
roof?

02:28:10.148 --> 02:28:12.169
LAURA: Maybe like an attic access or something?

02:28:12.169 --> 02:28:13.240
TALIESIN: French roof.

02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:14.428
MARISHA: 18.

02:28:14.428 --> 02:28:22.449
MATT: 18? You don't find an entry way per se. One
of the chimneys is wide enough for someone to pass

02:28:22.449 --> 02:28:28.116
through. It looks like there is a part of the roof
that, if you were to try and remove some of the

02:28:28.116 --> 02:28:30.756
shingles, there might be some sort of entrance
below it.

02:28:31.866 --> 02:28:33.061
MARISHA: Okay.

02:28:33.061 --> 02:28:35.360
MATT: You're on an angle there, on each side.

02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:42.741
MARISHA: It looks like they need to re-roof. Like
they haven't done it in about 15 years. Right?

02:28:42.965 --> 02:28:43.832
SAM: Sure.

02:28:43.832 --> 02:28:50.637
MARISHA: So maybe we could get in. Or, go through
the cellar. Or, be like Santa Claus.

02:28:50.637 --> 02:28:52.611
LAURA: I think we should go in through the roof.

02:28:52.611 --> 02:28:55.454
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's shimmy across. Make
the distraction now.

02:28:55.454 --> 02:28:56.791
LAURA: We already shimmied.

02:28:56.791 --> 02:28:58.014
SAM: No we didn't!

02:28:58.072 --> 02:29:01.191
MARISHA: It's happening now. It's real time. Real
time! I think.

02:29:01.741 --> 02:29:03.353
LIAM: I'm sending Frumpkin now, okay?

02:29:03.353 --> 02:29:05.151
SAM: Go. Sausage cat!

02:29:05.151 --> 02:29:09.333
MATT: You watch as Frumpkin runs past (cat
yowling) outside of the gate. Immediately (dog

02:29:09.333 --> 02:29:14.161
barking). He's like, "No!" (guard stuttering) The
dog drags him to the opposite side, like around

02:29:14.161 --> 02:29:18.198
the outside, into the fence and is now trying to
bite. And Frumpkin's on the other side of the

02:29:18.198 --> 02:29:23.102
fence, going (meows and hisses). (barking), right
into the fence. The guy's still holding back, like

02:29:23.102 --> 02:29:28.948
"Shit, no, stop! God, stop it!" Is pulling. You
guys all make it across--no one seems to notice,

02:29:28.948 --> 02:29:31.108
none the wiser--onto the roof.

02:29:31.108 --> 02:29:36.572
LAURA: Hey, Nott. Send a message to Fjord and say,
"Hey, did we look cool, just then?"

02:29:36.572 --> 02:29:41.820
SAM: Okay, I take out my little piece of wire and
I whisper the incantation and do the motions.

02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:47.200
Hey, Fjord, Jester wants to know: Did we look
cool? You can respond to this message.

02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:49.267
(laughter)

02:29:49.267 --> 02:29:51.153
TRAVIS: Did they go already?

02:29:51.153 --> 02:29:53.424
SAM: He said, "Did they go already?"

02:29:53.424 --> 02:29:55.023
(laughter)

02:29:55.023 --> 02:29:58.610
TALIESIN: I heard a dog barking. I feel that this
plan was no better than ours.

02:29:58.610 --> 02:30:01.486
MATT: You guys are watching; you guys are on--?

02:30:01.486 --> 02:30:03.753
TALIESIN: We’re keeping an eye on the street.

02:30:03.753 --> 02:30:05.215
MATT: Perception check from both you guys.

02:30:05.215 --> 02:30:06.432
LIAM: Where are they in relation to us too, by the
way?

02:30:06.432 --> 02:30:07.795
MATT: That's up to them.

02:30:07.892 --> 02:30:12.707
TALIESIN: I think we're on a corner, like far
enough away from the house not to be a problem.

02:30:12.707 --> 02:30:16.104
LIAM: I want to know if you're within view of the
guard with the dog's initial position.

02:30:16.341 --> 02:30:17.334
TRAVIS: 16.

02:30:17.334 --> 02:30:18.350
TALIESIN: 21.

02:30:18.350 --> 02:30:23.218
MATT: Okay. Keeping an eye out there, there isn't
any, at the moment, notable individuals wandering

02:30:23.218 --> 02:30:27.813
towards, or snooping around the house or your
position. So you feel pretty safe.

02:30:27.881 --> 02:30:29.485
TALIESIN: You look like a guard.

02:30:29.485 --> 02:30:35.333
TRAVIS: Not yet. I should. Yeah, I'll wander into
an alley.

02:30:35.333 --> 02:30:38.567
MATT: And change into a crownsguard?
Okay. Got it.

02:30:38.567 --> 02:30:40.051
TALIESIN: I got my cards out.

02:30:40.078 --> 02:30:41.500
MATT: You guys, you are on the roof.

02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:44.383
MARISHA: There was a guard named Cloen, who was
the guard who saw the spider.

02:30:44.383 --> 02:30:46.533
MATT: There are two chimneys.

02:30:46.533 --> 02:30:48.174
MARISHA: Just throwing that out there.

02:30:48.174 --> 02:30:50.332
MATT: There is the slight roof thing that you
saw.

02:30:50.332 --> 02:30:54.939
LIAM: So what I would do is also, once we're in
position on the roof, is I would tell Frumpkin to

02:30:54.939 --> 02:30:59.697
back off away from that dog, out of vision, and
wait a few minutes, because he's within a hundred

02:30:59.697 --> 02:31:08.140
feet of me. If so, we're good. Tell him to find
Molly, and sit with Molly. He'll always listen to

02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:12.157
me, but I'm also sending him the command to listen
to Molly, if need be.

02:31:12.157 --> 02:31:15.464
MATT: Easy enough to do. All right. So.

02:31:15.464 --> 02:31:16.809
LIAM: You don't know that. But, still.

02:31:16.809 --> 02:31:20.980
MATT: The barking slows. The dog is still barking
in the direction of what was there, and seems to

02:31:20.980 --> 02:31:26.486
be still really entranced with the possibility of
getting that fucking cat. Frumpkin does find his

02:31:26.486 --> 02:31:30.357
way to you, Molly. Guys on the roof, what are you
doing?

02:31:30.357 --> 02:31:33.069
MARISHA: Got to get through this roof.

02:31:33.069 --> 02:31:35.523
LIAM: What were you saying? I did not hear you.

02:31:35.523 --> 02:31:37.488
LAURA: Pry at the shingles. Look at how deep these
go.

02:31:37.488 --> 02:31:39.742
SAM: I'm going to go down the chimney.

02:31:39.742 --> 02:31:42.195
LIAM: Yeah, good, we covered-- If we do the
shingles, how do we cover them up when we leave?

02:31:42.195 --> 02:31:43.632
We're trying to leave no trace.

02:31:43.632 --> 02:31:45.520
LAURA: Who gives a shit? Who's going to be on the
fucking roof?

02:31:45.589 --> 02:31:49.879
MARISHA: I step around. How do the shingles feel?

02:31:49.879 --> 02:31:54.399
MATT: Some of them loosen and slip a little bit,
and you can see there's a very, very faint groove

02:31:54.399 --> 02:31:56.286
on the wood beneath it. Like a gap.

02:31:56.286 --> 02:31:58.232
LAURA: Not everyone can fit through the chimney.

02:31:58.303 --> 02:31:59.332
MARISHA: Nott!

02:31:59.332 --> 02:32:00.199
SAM: What?

02:32:00.199 --> 02:32:01.377
MARISHA: Do you have a dagger?

02:32:01.377 --> 02:32:02.514
SAM: I have a shortsword.

02:32:02.514 --> 02:32:03.574
MARISHA: Can I borrow it?

02:32:03.574 --> 02:32:04.557
LIAM: I have a dagger.

02:32:04.557 --> 02:32:07.015
MARISHA: Can I borrow any bladed thing? Thank
you.

02:32:07.015 --> 02:32:08.897
SAM: I don't like to lend my items out.

02:32:08.897 --> 02:32:11.142
MARISHA: I'm going to jack it up and see if I
can--

02:32:11.142 --> 02:32:12.699
LAURA: I cast thunder. Thaumaturgy.

02:32:12.699 --> 02:32:16.695
MATT: Okay. (thunder rumbling) off in the
distance. As you begin to pry a little bit, it

02:32:16.695 --> 02:32:19.144
begins to move up. There is some sort of a hatch.

02:32:19.144 --> 02:32:20.817
MARISHA: Does it feel like a trap door?

02:32:20.817 --> 02:32:22.255
MATT: It feels like a trap door a little bit.

02:32:22.255 --> 02:32:23.445
MARISHA: Oh, my god.

02:32:23.445 --> 02:32:27.995
MATT: As it's pulling up, the shingles that are
overlapped on it are overlapping the gap and start

02:32:27.995 --> 02:32:32.417
sliding a little bit. You immediately feel like if
you open this, you're going to send a bunch of

02:32:32.417 --> 02:32:34.034
shingles sliding off of the roof.

02:32:34.034 --> 02:32:35.566
LIAM: No, get them. Get them.

02:32:35.566 --> 02:32:39.459
SAM: Let's go down the chimney. At least I can go
down there and look to see if it's possible.

02:32:39.459 --> 02:32:41.784
MATT: There is a very faint trail of smoke coming
out of the chimney, by the way.

02:32:41.784 --> 02:32:45.966
LAURA: There's a fire in there. What if we pull up
these shingles?

02:32:45.966 --> 02:32:47.282
MARISHA: Yeah, pull up the shingles.

02:32:47.282 --> 02:32:48.572
LAURA: And, like, stack them.

02:32:48.572 --> 02:32:50.303
MATT: So you begin to collect them. Where are you
putting them?

02:32:50.303 --> 02:32:52.008
SAM: In the haversack!

02:32:52.091 --> 02:32:55.789
MATT: Okay. So you take a moment to go ahead and
carefully-- You have a collection now of roughly

02:32:55.789 --> 02:32:58.187
23 roof shingles in your haversack.

02:32:58.401 --> 02:32:59.820
MARISHA: Those could be valuable.

02:32:59.820 --> 02:33:01.371
MATT: So you can add that to your equipment.

02:33:01.371 --> 02:33:03.292
MARISHA: Are they clay shingles? Very valuable.

02:33:03.292 --> 02:33:04.940
LIAM: Look out, giant red dragons.

02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:06.568
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

02:33:06.568 --> 02:33:10.634
MATT: We'll say it takes you about five minutes or
so to finally get all those off carefully. You

02:33:10.634 --> 02:33:14.432
manage to pry it open, and it opens up ever so
slightly, and there's a chain on each end that

02:33:14.432 --> 02:33:19.052
prevent it from (slamming open). It opens up just
enough that you can slip inside, and there is a

02:33:19.052 --> 02:33:25.390
small ladder there that you can use to slowly get
down into a small attic.

02:33:25.390 --> 02:33:27.263
LAURA: I'll hold it open if you guys go scout.

02:33:27.263 --> 02:33:30.252
MARISHA: Okay. Do you want to let them know that
we're going in?

02:33:30.252 --> 02:33:33.633
SAM: Yes. I pull out my thing, and I do my thing.

02:33:33.633 --> 02:33:35.367
MARISHA: Then Beau will go down first.

02:33:35.367 --> 02:33:39.579
SAM: We're going in, to the house. You can
respond to this message.

02:33:43.015 --> 02:33:44.141
They're dead.

02:33:44.141 --> 02:33:48.674
LIAM: I drop in after Beauregard and I cast Detect
Magic immediately.

02:33:48.757 --> 02:33:50.355
MATT: Okay. You cast Detect Magic.

02:33:50.355 --> 02:33:51.469
LIAM: 30 feet.

02:33:51.469 --> 02:33:52.878
TRAVIS: They're going in the house.

02:33:52.878 --> 02:33:54.635
MATT: Right, 30 feet in the vicinity.

02:33:54.635 --> 02:34:02.493
MARISHA: I do the cool thing where, like, I slide
down, like a fireman, down the ladder a little bit.

02:34:02.602 --> 02:34:06.322
MATT: Okay. It only goes down about five feet or
so. It's a very small crawl space.

02:34:06.322 --> 02:34:08.195
MARISHA: Well, I look real cool for five feet.

02:34:08.195 --> 02:34:12.639
MATT: You do. It's a very small crawl space. It's
maybe, like, ten foot by five foot. It's very

02:34:12.639 --> 02:34:18.722
dusty in here. It looks like there are a few clay
pots. There looks to be a portrait, like some sort

02:34:18.722 --> 02:34:25.636
of a large art piece, that's leaning against the
wall and has some cobwebs over it. Other than

02:34:25.636 --> 02:34:32.558
that, it looks fairly empty, like it hasn't been
used fully. You, casting Detect Magic. Let me

02:34:32.634 --> 02:34:33.788
check real fast.

02:34:38.329 --> 02:34:42.416
Yeah. So you look around the
vicinity in this chamber and you do not see any

02:34:42.416 --> 02:34:46.002
sort of faint magical aura in the crawlspace.

02:34:46.002 --> 02:34:52.377
SAM: Are there any other doors in this crawl space
that lead into the main?

02:34:52.377 --> 02:34:53.946
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:34:54.597 --> 02:34:56.333
SAM: Natural 20.

02:34:56.333 --> 02:35:00.193
MATT: You do find, there is another trapdoor on
the opposite end of the crawl space that is

02:35:00.193 --> 02:35:04.455
partially blocked by the art piece that's leaning
against it. You shift it out of the way and

02:35:04.455 --> 02:35:13.925
unhinge the top, and it opens and drops down to a
hallway that has like faint a crackling firelight

02:35:13.925 --> 02:35:20.421
inside this hallway. You glance down inside. You
can see a long hallway with tapestries on each

02:35:20.421 --> 02:35:27.939
wall of a beautiful writing. There are two
ornamental armor sets that are set up on the side.

02:35:27.939 --> 02:35:33.786
You can see an ornamental sword that is bolted on
the wall on the opposite end and stairs not too

02:35:33.786 --> 02:35:39.389
far from where you are that head further down into
the building, and there is a doorway that leads to

02:35:39.389 --> 02:35:42.391
the right on the opposite end of the hallway.

02:35:42.391 --> 02:35:44.277
MARISHA: Jester, can you go ahead and cast a
spell?

02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:45.535
LAURA: What spell?

02:35:45.535 --> 02:35:47.881
MARISHA: The locate-the-thing spell.

02:35:47.881 --> 02:35:50.793
LAURA: I am distracted by looking at this
beautiful piece of art.

02:35:50.793 --> 02:35:54.337
SAM: Do you want to draw a mustache on it, or
something? A dick butt?

02:35:54.337 --> 02:35:57.723
LAURA: I think I studied this artist back at
home.

02:35:57.723 --> 02:36:01.564
LIAM: You know, we want to be efficient here.
Quick.

02:36:01.564 --> 02:36:10.074
LAURA: Oh, okay. It only last for ten minutes
though when I do it. So if we don't find it soon then--

02:36:10.074 --> 02:36:16.913
LIAM: Yes, save more time to doing so. Let's start
moving. And you’re looking for bad physical things.

02:36:17.042 --> 02:36:18.152
LAURA: I'm going to--

02:36:18.152 --> 02:36:18.969
SAM: Traps?

02:36:18.969 --> 02:36:22.036
SAM: Oh, God! Yes! Oh, God! I forgot to
look for any traps!

02:36:22.036 --> 02:36:24.054
ALL: Shh!

02:36:24.054 --> 02:36:26.546
SAM: Sorry. I going to take a big drink.

02:36:30.315 --> 02:36:33.215
LAURA: I'm sure Ulog can look for traps, because
he's also a rogue, right?

02:36:33.344 --> 02:36:35.196
MATT: He is, but he is behind you guys at this
point.

02:36:35.196 --> 02:36:37.757
LAURA: Ulog, help us. Please.

02:36:37.757 --> 02:36:40.646
MATT: "All right. The two of us will keep an eye
for traps." He's giving you an advantage. He's

02:36:40.646 --> 02:36:44.466
giving you the help actually. You were down to
casting what spell? You were casting--

02:36:44.466 --> 02:36:55.152
LAURA: I'm going to cast Locate Object. Cast
spell. I'm going to search for a wax seal.

02:36:55.152 --> 02:36:56.756
MATT: Okay.

02:36:56.756 --> 02:36:58.838
LIAM: What's the light situation like in here?

02:36:58.838 --> 02:37:04.910
MATT: You go down and there are two torches that
are burning in the edge, but they don't have a

02:37:04.910 --> 02:37:09.287
fuel source. They are an ever-burning torch and
they are both fixed to the wall, giving this

02:37:09.287 --> 02:37:12.923
flickering light in the vicinity. You’ve come down
to the hallway?

02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:14.041
LIAM: Yeah.

02:37:14.041 --> 02:37:15.270
MARISHA: LEDs, yeah.

02:37:15.270 --> 02:37:19.056
MATT: So you guys have made your way down into the
hallway. You’re still concentrating the spell,

02:37:19.056 --> 02:37:19.862
right?

02:37:19.862 --> 02:37:20.846
LIAM: Hells yes.

02:37:20.846 --> 02:37:24.083
MATT: There are magical auras emulating from these
torches. They're both everlight. You've seen this

02:37:24.083 --> 02:37:29.689
magic before. They just continuously burn. It’s
continual flame. You also get a faint magical aura

02:37:29.689 --> 02:37:33.687
from each of the suits of armor, and a faint
magical aura from the sword across the way on the

02:37:33.687 --> 02:37:35.000
opposite wall.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:36.190
LIAM: Okay.

02:37:37.790 --> 02:37:39.637
LAURA: Like traps? Or they are just--

02:37:39.929 --> 02:37:41.456
SAM: I'm going to look for traps.

02:37:41.456 --> 02:37:44.127
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check
with advantage.

02:37:44.127 --> 02:37:45.945
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

02:37:47.705 --> 02:37:49.722
LIAM: Do I know the school of magic?

02:37:49.785 --> 02:37:50.808
SAM: 20.

02:37:52.658 --> 02:37:54.325
MATT: What'd you roll? A 20?

02:37:54.354 --> 02:37:55.391
SAM: 20.

02:37:55.391 --> 02:38:01.340
MATT: 20. You carefully go forward and both you
and Ulog pay attention. The floorboards of this

02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:07.603
hallway progress one after another, and there's a
cluster about four of them, about

02:38:07.603 --> 02:38:15.616
a-foot-and-a-half across each of them, that are
slightly lifted on one side. Glancing forward, you

02:38:15.616 --> 02:38:21.822
can see there’s some sort of pressure device that
triggers when those boards are stepped on.

02:38:21.822 --> 02:38:27.092
LIAM: There's no magical aura from those at all?
Those are separate. You're not saying.

02:38:27.092 --> 02:38:28.113
MATT: You're not sure.

02:38:28.113 --> 02:38:29.421
LIAM: Okay.

02:38:29.421 --> 02:38:31.788
SAM: Ulog, you didn't find anything. I found a
trap.

02:38:31.788 --> 02:38:34.113
MATT: "Actually-- fine."

02:38:34.239 --> 02:38:40.527
LIAM: The spell says I know the school of magic
for what's on these things. You able to tell me that?

02:38:40.641 --> 02:38:43.659
MATT: Correct. I would say-- That's an interesting
question.

02:38:43.659 --> 02:38:44.709
SAM: Necromancy.

02:38:44.709 --> 02:38:46.213
MATT: Let me check something real fast.

02:38:46.213 --> 02:38:47.575
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:38:47.575 --> 02:38:50.237
MARISHA: There's undead bodies in the armor!

02:38:50.922 --> 02:38:55.353
MATT: We'll say it can go in two different ways.
I'm not entirely sure.

02:38:55.353 --> 02:38:57.673
LIAM: If you don’t know how to answer, it's fine.

02:38:57.673 --> 02:39:00.536
MATT: No, no. I do here. It would be--

02:39:00.536 --> 02:39:02.396
LIAM: (singing) Breaking the law. Breaking the
law.

02:39:02.396 --> 02:39:04.164
MARISHA: Breaking the law.

02:39:04.164 --> 02:39:06.582
MATT: We'll say conjuration.

02:39:06.647 --> 02:39:09.089
LIAM: Okay. <i>Ja.</i>

02:39:09.162 --> 02:39:11.811
MATT: No, transmutation, which you know well.

02:39:11.811 --> 02:39:14.133
SAM: Edubation.

02:39:14.133 --> 02:39:21.065
LIAM: I'm an expert in edubation. 
That's Liam, not Caleb.

02:39:21.065 --> 02:39:22.055
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

02:39:22.055 --> 02:39:24.516
I have a very bad feeling about these suits of armor.

02:39:24.516 --> 02:39:26.703
LAURA: So we won't touch them.

02:39:26.703 --> 02:39:29.195
MARISHA: That was him. That was him. I did not say
that.

02:39:29.218 --> 02:39:30.818
SAM: Let's jump over this little hump.

02:39:30.818 --> 02:39:34.706
LIAM: Okay, but I don't know exactly how these
work, but I have a strong suspicion that these

02:39:34.706 --> 02:39:39.450
things can start moving and try to cut us up. Both
these suits of armor and that weapon.

02:39:39.450 --> 02:39:41.196
LAURA: Are those traps would set them off?

02:39:41.196 --> 02:39:42.315
LIAM: Maybe.

02:39:42.315 --> 02:39:48.012
MATT: Jester. As you finish concentrating on the spell and
focusing on the wax seal, you get a blip of its

02:39:48.086 --> 02:39:52.276
location in the next chamber beyond where you are
in the door on the right.

02:39:52.276 --> 02:39:55.419
LAURA: Oh my gosh! How great because we came in--

02:39:55.419 --> 02:39:56.723
SAM: Let's go!

02:39:56.723 --> 02:39:58.532
LAURA: We have to avoid the traps.

02:39:58.532 --> 02:40:00.481
SAM: Jump over that little hump.

02:40:00.481 --> 02:40:04.806
LIAM: Hopefully things will go very well, but
there's a chance that this thing that you are

02:40:04.806 --> 02:40:08.256
indicating is not connected to those, so be ready
to fight.

02:40:08.256 --> 02:40:14.488
LAURA: So duck down. It's like The Neverending
Story. Don't be afraid, you guys, just go!

02:40:14.598 --> 02:40:26.453
SAM: Wait, what if-- we are up shit's creek. So we
need Schmidt's creek. What if you have Schmidt do

02:40:26.534 --> 02:40:29.051
something? Can Schmidt go do something?

02:40:29.051 --> 02:40:33.599
MATT: As this is happening, Ulog is sighing
loudly, pulls out some tools, and begins to fiddle

02:40:33.599 --> 02:40:42.666
with where the boards are on the ground. He
manages to get a shortsword of his pressed

02:40:42.666 --> 02:40:48.247
underneath where the boards are and slips it
across, slightly lifting each one as he goes until

02:40:48.247 --> 02:40:53.629
the sword peeks out the opposite side acting as a
platform beneath.

02:40:53.758 --> 02:40:55.789
MARISHA: Dope! Yeah!

02:40:55.789 --> 02:40:57.821
SAM: I told him to do that, I sort of--

02:40:57.821 --> 02:41:00.293
He goes, "Watch and learn, little one."

02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:02.344
LAURA: It's like a training session.

02:41:02.344 --> 02:41:05.447
MATT: He goes and carefully steps on the boards,
and then steps across with no effect.

02:41:05.447 --> 02:41:07.099
SAM: Is he mansplaining to me?

02:41:07.099 --> 02:41:09.139
MATT: Roguesplaining, technically.

02:41:09.139 --> 02:41:11.187
LIAM: This. Is. Exciting.

02:41:11.187 --> 02:41:13.735
LAURA: Come on this only lasts ten minutes let's
go!

02:41:13.735 --> 02:41:17.566
MARISHA: Someone stay watch. We're going to go
this way.

02:41:17.566 --> 02:41:23.139
SAM: We're making progress! You can respond to
this message.

02:41:23.139 --> 02:41:24.644
TRAVIS: I'm over here.

02:41:24.644 --> 02:41:26.364
SAM: We're making progress!

02:41:26.364 --> 02:41:29.303
(laughter)

02:41:29.405 --> 02:41:33.267
MATT: As you guys head in, there's the closed door
that leads into the chamber where you're sensing

02:41:33.267 --> 02:41:35.041
this aura.

02:41:35.041 --> 02:41:38.455
LAURA: Okay. Detect for traps. Look for traps on
this door.

02:41:38.455 --> 02:41:43.652
SAM: Me? Okay. I'm gonna look for traps. Eight, plus
five. 13.

02:41:43.756 --> 02:41:46.589
MATT: 13, okay. It is trapped.

02:41:46.589 --> 02:41:48.798
SAM: Oh! It's a door? That's trapped?

02:41:48.798 --> 02:41:50.543
MATT: Yes. It's not locked, but it is trapped.

02:41:50.543 --> 02:41:52.125
MARISHA: Do I hear any movement in the house?

02:41:52.125 --> 02:41:54.018
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:41:54.018 --> 02:41:56.738
LAURA: How do we disarm a trap?

02:41:56.738 --> 02:41:58.245
MARISHA: Not bad, not bad.

02:41:58.245 --> 02:41:59.707
SAM: We let Ulog do it!

02:41:59.790 --> 02:42:00.862
MARISHA: 15.

02:42:00.862 --> 02:42:04.473
MATT: 15. You listen out. You do not hear any
movement in the house other than what you

02:42:04.473 --> 02:42:05.634
currently are making.

02:42:05.634 --> 02:42:06.711
MARISHA: Okay.

02:42:06.788 --> 02:42:07.608
TALIESIN: (hiccups)

02:42:07.608 --> 02:42:09.411
MATT: And a hiccup from out in the distance.

02:42:09.411 --> 02:42:12.127
TALIESIN: Hello, pick a card.

02:42:12.127 --> 02:42:14.829
MATT: Perception check from both of you guys, by
the way, while this is happening.

02:42:20.804 --> 02:42:22.262
TRAVIS: 11.

02:42:22.262 --> 02:42:23.643
TALIESIN: 11.

02:42:23.643 --> 02:42:26.829
MATT: Okay. You don't seem to notice anything. All
right. So you guys--

02:42:26.829 --> 02:42:30.632
SAM: I'm going to try to disarm it.

02:42:30.632 --> 02:42:32.174
MATT: All right. You pull out your thieves'--

02:42:32.174 --> 02:42:33.959
SAM: Do I see the triggering mechanism?

02:42:33.959 --> 02:42:38.934
MATT: We'll find out! Go ahead and make a thieves'
tools check. So roll a d20, add your proficiency

02:42:38.934 --> 02:42:42.093
modifier and your dexterity modifier. Should be
plus six, I think?

02:42:43.643 --> 02:42:44.740
SAM: Yes, 16.

02:42:45.013 --> 02:42:51.785
MATT: 16! As you carefully get down to where the
knob is, you begin to turn it ever so slightly and

02:42:51.785 --> 02:42:58.941
you hear this spring begin to tighten, and you're
familiar with that sound. So you manage to get

02:42:58.941 --> 02:43:03.986
your tool underneath, and you find where the
spring is, it's barely in the space between where

02:43:03.986 --> 02:43:08.147
the door and the edge of the door frame is. You
get the tool underneath, capture it, and as you

02:43:08.147 --> 02:43:12.496
pull the door open it prevents the spring from
pulling back into the device. You slowly, as you

02:43:12.496 --> 02:43:16.765
expose it, reach in, snap the opposing side and
remove the spring entirely, leaving the trap

02:43:16.765 --> 02:43:17.871
inert.

02:43:17.871 --> 02:43:21.394
SAM: These are your tools, Beau!

02:43:21.394 --> 02:43:25.248
LIAM: I wish I was still a rogue, it's the best
class!

02:43:25.248 --> 02:43:27.950
SAM: I feel so alive!

02:43:27.950 --> 02:43:34.135
MATT: As the door opens into a fairly
well-decorated master bedroom. You see a large

02:43:34.135 --> 02:43:42.890
canopy bed, a beautiful detailed embroidered rug
that consumes the center of the floor. You can see

02:43:42.890 --> 02:43:48.621
a fireplace to your right, the one that you saw
that was attached to the top of the roof, that has

02:43:48.621 --> 02:43:54.323
a fire burning in it. It has two giant statues of
lions on each side, this cool detailed shelf

02:43:54.323 --> 02:44:01.528
there. You can see a table with chairs to your
left. You can see a slight opening to a balcony

02:44:01.528 --> 02:44:04.254
that's not visible from the outside.

02:44:04.254 --> 02:44:06.344
SAM: Ooh, an invisible balcony.

02:44:06.344 --> 02:44:09.566
LIAM: I walk up behind Nott and scan the room with
the spell.

02:44:09.566 --> 02:44:13.603
MATT: Okay. You're just scanning the room?

02:44:13.603 --> 02:44:18.243
LIAM: I'm just walking up behind Nott, no further,
and looking in to see what glows.

02:44:18.243 --> 02:44:25.236
MATT: All right. As you glance in and look, there
is immediately to your left a large metal cabinet

02:44:25.236 --> 02:44:35.585
of some kind. It is made of dark iron, and gives a
very faint magical aura to it. The rug in the

02:44:35.585 --> 02:44:38.446
center of the room gives a faint magical aura as
well.

02:44:38.446 --> 02:44:40.023
SAM: The rug?

02:44:40.023 --> 02:44:41.964
LAURA: Flying carpet!

02:44:41.964 --> 02:44:43.027
TALIESIN: No.

02:44:45.227 --> 02:44:47.485
LAURA: Look for traps in the room.

02:44:47.988 --> 02:44:50.618
SAM: Okay. Did you see the lock I just--

02:44:50.618 --> 02:44:52.079
TRAVIS: Fuckin' focus!

02:44:52.079 --> 02:44:53.496
LAURA: I did, but hurry!

02:44:53.496 --> 02:44:54.272
SAM: 19.

02:44:56.427 --> 02:44:58.149
MATT: You're looking for--

02:44:58.149 --> 02:44:59.205
SAM: Traps.

02:44:59.205 --> 02:45:10.987
MATT: Okay, investigation check. You glance around
and look in the chamber. You don't see anything

02:45:10.987 --> 02:45:17.358
that gives the essence of a trap to you. It looks
like the trap was part of the entry here, but

02:45:17.358 --> 02:45:20.434
there's nothing immediately in the vicinity that
resembles a triggering trap.

02:45:20.434 --> 02:45:24.766
LIAM: What kind of magic is emanating from the
carpet? What school of magic?

02:45:24.766 --> 02:45:35.658
MATT: The carpet? It's also transmutation, and the
magic on the large case has a faint abjuration.

02:45:35.658 --> 02:45:39.030
LAURA: Where is the glow for the seal is coming
from?

02:45:39.030 --> 02:45:40.979
MATT: It's underneath the rug.

02:45:40.979 --> 02:45:44.918
LIAM: I alert everyone. The carpet is magical.

02:45:44.918 --> 02:45:46.708
SAM: We should not step on it.

02:45:46.708 --> 02:45:49.770
LAURA: Well, I need to move it because the seal is
under the rug.

02:45:49.770 --> 02:45:51.599
MARISHA: The seal's under the rug?

02:45:51.599 --> 02:45:54.233
SAM: Do we have anything that can negate the magic
or--

02:45:55.783 --> 02:45:57.803
MARISHA: Do you have Dispel Magic?

02:45:57.806 --> 02:45:59.033
LIAM: I do not.

02:45:59.033 --> 02:46:05.140
SAM: Can Schmidt stand on the carpet? Oh! I can
move it with my Mage Hand or something, or peel it

02:46:05.140 --> 02:46:07.075
back with my mage hand.

02:46:08.235 --> 02:46:11.420
MATT: Mage Hand. Very helpful when setting
grappling hooks on roofs.

02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:15.232
SAM: Oh, shit! Shut up, Ulog!

02:46:15.792 --> 02:46:18.306
MATT: "I'm just saying, if I knew you could do
that, you could've--"

02:46:18.306 --> 02:46:20.359
SAM: Fuck you, I know what I'm doing.

02:46:22.979 --> 02:46:25.008
LAURA: So move the fucking carpet!

02:46:25.474 --> 02:46:26.532
SAM: You want me to move the carpet?

02:46:26.532 --> 02:46:27.772
LAURA: Move the rug.

02:46:27.772 --> 02:46:32.096
MARISHA: Can I do a look for anything that looks
out of place, any papers, anything, trap doors?

02:46:32.096 --> 02:46:33.342
MATT: Investigation check.

02:46:33.342 --> 02:46:38.794
LIAM: I have a question. The carpet reeks of
abjuration, or-- I would know that the carpet is magical.

02:46:38.886 --> 02:46:40.184
SAM: It was transmutation.

02:46:40.184 --> 02:46:43.470
LIAM: Transmutation. If the carpet is magical, I
wouldn't--

02:46:43.470 --> 02:46:49.094
MATT: You can only see magical sources from what
you can see. So if a thing's behind a wall or

02:46:49.094 --> 02:46:51.383
behind an object you don't see an aura.

02:46:51.383 --> 02:46:56.774
LIAM: Right. The carpet seems magical to me, I
wouldn't think that something under the carpet is magical.

02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:58.497
TRAVIS: Yep, I saw it.

02:46:58.497 --> 02:46:59.935
MARISHA: Natural 20.

02:46:59.935 --> 02:47:04.831
MATT: Natural 20! As they're having this
conversation, you glance by the fireplace, the

02:47:04.831 --> 02:47:11.305
fire is crackling in there, and you glance down
and right underneath the hearth, up where the

02:47:11.305 --> 02:47:15.525
fire's tickling, you see a piece of the stonework
that doesn't match the others, it's slightly

02:47:15.525 --> 02:47:22.016
off-colored. It looks like the burning of the fire
that's been given this dark and blackened look to

02:47:22.016 --> 02:47:26.391
it, there's one brick there that doesn't seem to
have been affected by any of the soot at all.

02:47:26.391 --> 02:47:36.624
MARISHA: I, avoiding the rug, lightly step over
it, and see if I can jiggy the brick out.

02:47:36.624 --> 02:47:41.383
MATT: As your finger presses against the brick it
slides in about a half an inch, and you hear this

02:47:41.383 --> 02:47:45.403
(click) sound over by where the metal large
cabinet is.

02:47:45.403 --> 02:47:46.951
LAURA: You just unlocked the fucking metal shit!

02:47:46.951 --> 02:47:48.734
MARISHA: Oh shit!

02:47:48.734 --> 02:47:51.855
LIAM: Do I see any change in the abjuration magic
when she does that?

02:47:51.855 --> 02:47:52.803
MATT: Yes.

02:47:52.803 --> 02:47:54.087
MARISHA: Does it go away?

02:47:54.087 --> 02:47:55.266
MATT: It vanishes.

02:47:55.266 --> 02:47:58.266
(cheering)

02:47:58.266 --> 02:48:03.255
SAM: I'm going to cast Message. We are the fucking
best! You can respond to this message!

02:48:03.255 --> 02:48:07.106
(laughter)

02:48:08.826 --> 02:48:10.628
LAURA: I got to get that seal!

02:48:10.877 --> 02:48:16.859
LIAM: What you just did dispelled whatever ward
was on the cabinet, however the carpet I can't

02:48:16.859 --> 02:48:18.932
tell exactly what's going on but there is
something--

02:48:18.932 --> 02:48:20.795
LAURA: Use the Mage Hand to move the carpet.

02:48:20.795 --> 02:48:22.281
MARISHA: Give me the papers.

02:48:22.281 --> 02:48:26.656
SAM: I cast Mage Hand and slowly peel back a
corner of the carpet.

02:48:26.656 --> 02:48:29.941
LAURA: I hand the two letters that we made for
Lord Sutan.

02:48:29.941 --> 02:48:37.109
MATT: Okay, the carpet peels back and it reveals
beneath it a section of the wood that has a hinge

02:48:37.109 --> 02:48:42.353
bolted to one side of it. It's a square that's cut
out of it, it looks like it's an open case. The

02:48:42.353 --> 02:48:47.484
carpet peels back, and then begins to fold back in
its space, and then fold up again. It begins to

02:48:47.484 --> 02:48:53.671
slightly shift and rise, and the carpet almost
seems to be gliding in the air on its own in the

02:48:53.671 --> 02:49:01.872
vicinity. It spins towards you and then <i>rushes</i>
in your direction. I need everyone to roll initiative.

02:49:01.983 --> 02:49:06.903
MARISHA: We're fighting a carpet! The fuck!

02:49:06.903 --> 02:49:09.410
LAURA: We're fighting a carpet.

02:49:09.410 --> 02:49:10.705
TALIESIN: We had it coming.

02:49:10.705 --> 02:49:12.232
LIAM: It's an animated object!

02:49:12.232 --> 02:49:14.309
TRAVIS: I had that in my one-shot.

02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:19.041
LIAM: My kids have fought a broom. This happens.

02:49:19.041 --> 02:49:21.164
LAURA: Whoa, look at that carpet!

02:49:21.164 --> 02:49:24.626
MATT: That carpet is now gone, because instead you
are fighting <i>that</i> carpet.

02:49:24.626 --> 02:49:27.825
(cheering)

02:49:27.825 --> 02:49:30.459
TRAVIS: It's like a cobra ready to strike!

02:49:30.459 --> 02:49:33.208
MATT: All righty, so Nott would've been over
here.

02:49:33.208 --> 02:49:34.868
LAURA: So we're rolling initiative, that's what
we're doing?

02:49:34.868 --> 02:49:39.021
MATT: Yes, roll initiative, please. Beau, you're
over by the fireplace so you've just seen that

02:49:39.021 --> 02:49:42.354
happen there, and I think that's--

02:49:43.454 --> 02:49:46.668
LIAM: I would be by Beau because I clapped her on
the shoulder.

02:49:46.946 --> 02:49:48.550
MATT: Right, right.

02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:50.184
SAM: Yeah, Holly.

02:49:50.184 --> 02:49:53.560
(laughter)

02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.217
MATT: I forgot my dwarf mini.

02:49:57.317 --> 02:49:58.401
SAM: Oh no!

02:49:58.401 --> 02:50:01.953
MATT: Well, no, it's in here somewhere. Forgot to
bring it out. I am unprepared!

02:50:01.953 --> 02:50:03.753
TRAVIS: Unprepared. Just use a d4.

02:50:03.753 --> 02:50:09.079
LIAM: (sarcastically) You are not prepared, oh
no.

02:50:09.079 --> 02:50:19.706
MATT: That's fine, I'll use this. I'll say that
that's him there, it's fine. Given that case,

02:50:19.706 --> 02:50:28.512
guys, first it's a surprise round, as it whips its
way over towards Nott.

02:50:29.632 --> 02:50:31.538
SAM: <i>It</i> gets a surprise round.

02:50:31.597 --> 02:50:36.747
MATT: It does, because it suddenly rushes in your
direction. That is going to be a 21 to hit.

02:50:36.747 --> 02:50:38.141
SAM: That hits.

02:50:38.141 --> 02:50:44.917
MATT: Natural 16. It goes and wraps around you and
completely envelops you within itself. All of a

02:50:44.917 --> 02:50:47.907
sudden you just see darkness, and you cannot
breathe.

02:50:47.907 --> 02:50:51.289
MARISHA: Oh, this is going to suck.

02:50:51.289 --> 02:50:55.650
MATT: Currently you are enveloped by the Rug of
Smothering.

02:50:57.110 --> 02:50:58.650
MARISHA: The Rug of Smothering.

02:50:58.650 --> 02:51:02.758
MATT: Initiative here. Top of the round, 25 to 20
anybody.

02:51:05.568 --> 02:51:06.668
SAM: 24.

02:51:06.892 --> 02:51:10.939
MATT: 24, that'll be you first, Nott. 20 to 15?

02:51:10.939 --> 02:51:11.972
LAURA: 17.

02:51:11.972 --> 02:51:14.156
MARISHA: 15.

02:51:15.926 --> 02:51:17.865
MATT: Beau. 15 to 10?

02:51:18.074 --> 02:51:21.871
TALIESIN: 15.

02:51:21.871 --> 02:51:24.642
MATT: What'd you get Caleb?

02:51:24.642 --> 02:51:26.476
LIAM: Well you know, I rolled a nine.

02:51:26.476 --> 02:51:28.353
MARISHA: Oh my god!

02:51:28.353 --> 02:51:31.782
TRAVIS: I’m not in this one, fucker. You guys are
the best, that's the last we heard.

02:51:31.782 --> 02:51:34.185
(laughter)

02:51:34.185 --> 02:51:37.964
LIAM: (singing) You're the best around! Nothing's
ever going to bring you down!

02:51:37.964 --> 02:51:43.818
MATT: It's true! Nott, it's your turn first. You
are restrained, you are blinded, and you are

02:51:43.818 --> 02:51:52.166
suffocating. At the start of your turn, you
immediately take 12 points of bludgeoning damage

02:51:52.166 --> 02:51:57.960
as it's now crushing and constricting your entire
body. You feel the life being pulled out of you as

02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:01.470
you're gasping for breath in this space. What are
you going to do with your turn?

02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:08.524
SAM: A VS spell is verbal. Can I talk?

02:52:08.583 --> 02:52:15.330
MATT: Yes, you can still talk. You're (muffled
sounds). You still have the breath you had in your

02:52:15.330 --> 02:52:22.295
body when it went around you, so I'll say you have
enough air for one spell and then that's all.

02:52:22.295 --> 02:52:30.359
SAM: Okay. I will touch it with Shocking Grasp,
cast Shocking Grasp on it.

02:52:30.359 --> 02:52:32.472
MATT: Is that a spell attack roll?

02:52:32.472 --> 02:52:39.180
SAM: It's touch, to hit plus five. So I have to
roll.

02:52:39.180 --> 02:52:43.005
MATT: Yeah, you would have disadvantage because
you're restrained, but it's also smothering you so

02:52:43.005 --> 02:52:46.771
I would give you advantage to that, so it's just a
straight roll.

02:52:46.771 --> 02:52:48.488
SAM: 13 plus five. 18!

02:52:48.488 --> 02:52:50.120
MATT: That hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

02:52:50.120 --> 02:53:03.121
SAM: Okay. One point of damage. However, it can't
take reactions until its next turn.

02:53:03.121 --> 02:53:04.774
MATT: Good to know.

02:53:06.524 --> 02:53:08.035
SAM: Does it let me go?

02:53:08.112 --> 02:53:09.322
MATT: Nope!

02:53:09.322 --> 02:53:10.923
SAM: I can't move away from it?

02:53:10.923 --> 02:53:14.354
MATT: No, you are restrained. You can try and
break free, but it's an action to try.

02:53:14.354 --> 02:53:16.201
SAM: Oh shit. Well, poo.

02:53:16.201 --> 02:53:18.762
MATT: But hey, there you go. Jester, you're up.

02:53:18.762 --> 02:53:23.613
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt on
it.

02:53:23.613 --> 02:53:28.625
MATT: Okay. You see it wrapping around and Nott's
flailing about as this carpet is crushing her

02:53:28.625 --> 02:53:30.979
little body. Go ahead and--

02:53:30.979 --> 02:53:32.621
LAURA: Roll a ranged attack.

02:53:32.621 --> 02:53:34.245
MATT: Yes. Go for it.

02:53:34.245 --> 02:53:36.505
LAURA: Oh! Natural 19.

02:53:36.505 --> 02:53:38.320
MATT: Oh yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage
on that.

02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:41.010
LAURA: That's 4d6. Radiant.

02:53:41.343 --> 02:53:42.767
TRAVIS: Yeah, get it!

02:53:44.897 --> 02:53:46.105
SAM: Damn!

02:53:47.165 --> 02:53:51.816
LAURA: 15 damage, and the next attack has
advantage against it.

02:53:51.816 --> 02:53:56.540
MATT: Okay, it takes eight points of radiant
damage, and Nott takes seven points of radiant damage.

02:53:56.586 --> 02:53:58.424
LAURA: (gasping) Oh no!

02:53:58.424 --> 02:54:01.820
MATT: As you blast you hear Nott (muffled
screaming) underneath, you get the sense all the

02:54:01.820 --> 02:54:05.525
damage dealt to this rug is divided with whoever
it's enveloping.

02:54:05.525 --> 02:54:07.400
LAURA: Oh no, I'm sorry, Nott!

02:54:07.400 --> 02:54:08.768
SAM: I can't hear you.

02:54:08.768 --> 02:54:10.847
TRAVIS: He doesn't know who's doing it, that's
okay.

02:54:10.847 --> 02:54:12.641
MATT: Jester, you going to stay where you are?

02:54:12.641 --> 02:54:14.408
LAURA: Where am I?

02:54:14.408 --> 02:54:16.944
MATT: Sorry, you would've been probably over
here.

02:54:18.407 --> 02:54:20.817
LAURA: Oh no, how do we get it off?

02:54:21.006 --> 02:54:23.137
LIAM: We damage it.

02:54:23.137 --> 02:54:25.165
LAURA: No, but we can't damage it.

02:54:25.165 --> 02:54:26.460
MATT: You going to move or stay here?

02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:28.376
LIAM: No, I understand, but we damage it.

02:54:28.376 --> 02:54:30.631
LAURA: I'm going to go stand on the bed!

02:54:31.035 --> 02:54:33.566
MATT: You move around and stand on the bed!

02:54:33.566 --> 02:54:35.287
SAM: And jump!

02:54:35.287 --> 02:54:38.428
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn Jester.
Beau, you're up.

02:54:38.428 --> 02:54:42.014
MARISHA: All right. I'm going to run up with my
staff and do a crack crack.

02:54:42.014 --> 02:54:43.505
LAURA: No, but--

02:54:43.505 --> 02:54:47.342
MARISHA: Let me do my fucking thing, man. Let me
do my fucking thing.

02:54:47.342 --> 02:54:48.824
TRAVIS: She doesn't know.

02:54:48.824 --> 02:54:50.143
MARISHA: I have no fucking clue.

02:54:50.143 --> 02:54:51.328
TRAVIS: Same six seconds!

02:54:51.328 --> 02:54:52.721
LAURA: No, but you just heard Nott scream!

02:54:52.721 --> 02:54:54.165
LIAM: No one knows, who the fuck knows?

02:54:54.165 --> 02:54:56.288
MARISHA: Sorry, Nott. Crack!

02:54:56.288 --> 02:55:02.821
SAM: (screaming) I'm hurting! You can reply to
this message!

02:55:03.951 --> 02:55:05.660
MARISHA: 16 for the first one.

02:55:05.804 --> 02:55:07.303
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:55:07.303 --> 02:55:12.493
MARISHA: Okay, that is six damage.

02:55:12.493 --> 02:55:14.498
MATT: That's three to you, Nott.

02:55:14.498 --> 02:55:16.515
SAM: I'm unconscious.

02:55:16.515 --> 02:55:17.784
TRAVIS: Are you?

02:55:17.784 --> 02:55:18.933
SAM: Uh-huh.

02:55:18.933 --> 02:55:20.726
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Fuck.

02:55:20.726 --> 02:55:22.990
MARISHA: For the second one.

02:55:22.990 --> 02:55:25.893
LAURA: Oh no, you're going to kill Nott!

02:55:25.893 --> 02:55:33.562
MARISHA: That hits. That's a natural 16. And
that's seven damage.

02:55:33.562 --> 02:55:37.118
MATT: Seven damage. That's four damage to the
thing and you fail a death saving throw.

02:55:37.118 --> 02:55:39.491
MARISHA: Now I'm going to spend a ki point.

02:55:39.491 --> 02:55:41.103
TRAVIS: Doesn't she fail two?

02:55:41.103 --> 02:55:45.828
MATT: No, that's on a critical. She wasn't
attacking Nott specifically. She was attacking the rug.

02:55:45.930 --> 02:55:51.710
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point and do
something that I have yet to do, which is Extract Aspects.

02:55:51.809 --> 02:55:53.091
SAM: What does that mean?

02:55:53.091 --> 02:55:54.630
TRAVIS: It can't have that many hit points,
right?

02:55:54.630 --> 02:55:57.095
MATT: Okay. So you hit it twice.

02:55:57.095 --> 02:56:01.044
MARISHA: Then I'm going to see if I can catch any
reverberations off of the rug.

02:56:01.044 --> 02:56:03.926
MATT: All right. And it makes a what saving throw?
Constitution?

02:56:03.926 --> 02:56:05.310
MARISHA: Constitution.

02:56:05.310 --> 02:56:07.157
MATT: That is an 11.

02:56:07.157 --> 02:56:08.489
MARISHA: Fail!

02:56:08.489 --> 02:56:10.361
MATT: All right. What do you want to know about
it?

02:56:10.361 --> 02:56:14.789
MARISHA: I want to know its damage
vulnerabilities. What's it vulnerable to?

02:56:14.789 --> 02:56:16.929
MATT: It is actually not vulnerable to anything.

02:56:16.929 --> 02:56:19.153
MARISHA: What?! Do I get something else?

02:56:19.153 --> 02:56:21.444
MATT: You learned it is not vulnerable to
anything.

02:56:21.444 --> 02:56:23.260
LIAM: You learned it's badass.

02:56:23.260 --> 02:56:25.083
TRAVIS: Goddamn it.

02:56:25.083 --> 02:56:28.670
LAURA: We have to try to pull the rug off of-- We
have to out-strength the rug!

02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:30.406
LIAM: Next. Moving on.

02:56:30.406 --> 02:56:32.020
MARISHA: Hey guys, Nott's in the rug.

02:56:32.020 --> 02:56:34.854
SAM: (muffled screaming)

02:56:34.854 --> 02:56:43.321
MATT: Now it's Ulog's turn. Ulog, who sees the rug
there, is going to rush over and attempt to--

02:56:43.321 --> 02:56:46.023
LIAM: Oh, Ulog is a little girl.

02:56:46.023 --> 02:56:49.008
MATT: I know. It was the best I could find in the
moment, you know?

02:56:49.008 --> 02:56:50.465
TRAVIS: It works.

02:56:50.465 --> 02:57:02.030
MATT: It's fine. He rolls a two, because NPCs that
I try and fight with can't roll shit. That misses.

02:57:02.030 --> 02:57:07.253
That misses. To your benefit, Ulog tries to stab
and is missing or hitting the edge of the tassels.

02:57:07.253 --> 02:57:13.461
It's not even making an impact on the rug. He is
going to use a bonus action to disengage and head

02:57:13.461 --> 02:57:18.574
back towards where the balcony is. All right. So
that goes ahead and ends that. That brings us to

02:57:18.574 --> 02:57:25.743
the rug's turn. The rug is going to go ahead and
release Nott, and is going to attempt to

02:57:25.883 --> 02:57:29.126
completely envelop Beau.

02:57:29.126 --> 02:57:32.012
MARISHA: Hey guys, Nott's down-- Oh shit.

02:57:32.012 --> 02:57:35.647
MATT: That's cocked. That is another 16. 21.

02:57:35.647 --> 02:57:36.935
MARISHA: Hits.

02:57:36.935 --> 02:57:38.640
LAURA: Oh, no.

02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:40.929
MATT: You, Beau, are now enveloped by the rug.

02:57:41.001 --> 02:57:44.208
MARISHA: Hey guys, I think this rug (choking).

02:57:44.454 --> 02:57:47.547
LAURA: How do we defeat this rug before it kills
all of us?

02:57:47.547 --> 02:57:51.063
MATT: All righty. That's going to go ahead and end
the rug's turn.

02:57:51.063 --> 02:57:53.533
TRAVIS: How'd you guys die? A rug.

02:57:53.533 --> 02:57:56.071
TALIESIN: Rugs are the new doors.

02:57:56.071 --> 02:57:59.773
MATT: Actually, the rug's going to go ahead,
because it can still move-- Well, it's speed is

02:57:59.773 --> 02:58:01.304
nothing, nevermind.

02:58:01.304 --> 02:58:02.904
TRAVIS: What? It moves into the fireplace?

02:58:02.904 --> 02:58:04.591
MATT: Well it would move her away. No, it's not
going to do that.

02:58:04.591 --> 02:58:05.979
TRAVIS: (screams)

02:58:05.979 --> 02:58:09.943
MATT: It doesn't have enough movement to move
much. That brings us to the bottom. Caleb, you're up.

02:58:09.968 --> 02:58:16.395
LIAM: Yeah, I pull the potion of healing I have
out of my belt, and I run over to Nott and I jam

02:58:16.395 --> 02:58:19.796
it into her mouth and pour it in. The whole time
I'm going through my list of spells thinking of

02:58:19.796 --> 02:58:23.790
what could help. There's nothing, but I'm going:
Dancing Lights, Fire Bolt, Friends, Alarm, Burning

02:58:23.790 --> 02:58:28.344
Hands, Chromatic Orb, Comprehend Languages, Detect
Magic. And I heal Nott.

02:58:28.344 --> 02:58:30.420
MATT: Go ahead and roll for the heal on that.

02:58:30.420 --> 02:58:34.396
MARISHA: And before I got wrapped up I said it's
not immune to any-- (choking)

02:58:35.925 --> 02:58:38.942
It has no weaknesses-- (choking)

02:58:38.942 --> 02:58:42.038
MATT: All righty. So how much does Nott heal?

02:58:42.038 --> 02:58:43.726
LIAM: 14 points.

02:58:43.726 --> 02:58:44.855
TRAVIS: Whoa!

02:58:44.855 --> 02:58:46.229
SAM: From one healing potion?

02:58:46.229 --> 02:58:47.745
LIAM: Greater.

02:58:47.745 --> 02:58:54.259
MATT: There you go. Top of the round. Nott, your
turn. As you come to consciousness, you are still prone.

02:58:54.385 --> 02:58:56.374
TRAVIS: Return that damage.

02:58:56.374 --> 02:58:59.590
MATT: Caleb moved around to join your side there
to go ahead and apply the potion.

02:58:59.590 --> 02:59:03.373
SAM: We can't hurt Beau!

02:59:03.373 --> 02:59:05.063
MARISHA: No, it's fine.

02:59:05.063 --> 02:59:06.943
SAM: I will go and try to wrestle the--

02:59:06.943 --> 02:59:08.148
TRAVIS: You're a god!

02:59:08.148 --> 02:59:10.389
MARISHA: (choking)

02:59:10.389 --> 02:59:12.922
MATT: You know what, go ahead and make an
athletics check.

02:59:13.985 --> 02:59:15.814
SAM: Two.

02:59:15.814 --> 02:59:20.370
MATT: No. You rush up and you grab it, and it
actually lifts you off your feet and you are now

02:59:20.370 --> 02:59:24.374
being flailed in the air as you're grabbing the
edge of the rug, going (screams).

02:59:24.374 --> 02:59:25.670
SAM: (screaming)

02:59:25.726 --> 02:59:28.211
MATT: All right that ends your turn. Jester,
you're up.

02:59:28.211 --> 02:59:31.181
LAURA: I'm going to try to go help Nott and I'm
going to do the same thing. I'm going to try to

02:59:31.181 --> 02:59:33.208
pry the rug off of Beau.

02:59:33.208 --> 02:59:35.730
MATT: Okay. You move up. Go ahead and make an
athletics check.

02:59:35.730 --> 02:59:37.525
MARISHA: This is the best!

02:59:41.365 --> 02:59:42.960
TALIESIN: That's a number.

02:59:42.960 --> 02:59:45.095
LAURA: That's a number. It's a 12.

02:59:45.095 --> 02:59:48.763
MATT: 12. You grab and you're not pulled off your
feet, but the rug is too strong and it's not quite

02:59:48.763 --> 02:59:55.227
releasing its hold on Beau. Beau, it's your turn.
At the top of your turn, you suffer ten points of

02:59:55.227 --> 02:59:56.597
bludgeoning damage.

02:59:56.597 --> 02:59:57.832
TRAVIS: Wow!

02:59:57.954 --> 03:00:03.222
MATT: As it's crushing your body on the inside and
you cannot breathe. It is your turn, though. You

03:00:03.222 --> 03:00:04.778
can still go.

03:00:04.778 --> 03:00:06.743
LIAM: He's killing our nostalgia for the carpet.

03:00:06.743 --> 03:00:09.046
LAURA: I wonder if there's something in the room
that will--

03:00:09.046 --> 03:00:09.845
SAM: Turn it off?

03:00:09.845 --> 03:00:10.723
LAURA: Turn it off.

03:00:10.723 --> 03:00:13.968
LIAM: He would have had to have told me that there
was magic anywhere else in the room.

03:00:13.968 --> 03:00:16.284
LAURA: No, because the thing in the fireplace.

03:00:16.284 --> 03:00:18.415
LIAM: Right, was physical. That's true.

03:00:20.323 --> 03:00:22.023
MATT: What are you doing, Beau?

03:00:22.200 --> 03:00:23.794
MARISHA: Can I do any type of attack? What can I
do?

03:00:23.794 --> 03:00:25.394
MATT: Yeah, you just have disadvantage on the
attacks.

03:00:25.394 --> 03:00:26.731
MARISHA: I just have disadvantage.

03:00:26.731 --> 03:00:28.319
LIAM: Come on, you are a badass. You can do it.

03:00:28.319 --> 03:00:29.589
TRAVIS: Roll that fucking shit.

03:00:29.589 --> 03:00:33.105
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to try and elbow the
fucking shit out this rug.

03:00:33.105 --> 03:00:35.042
LIAM: You're the best of all of us.

03:00:35.042 --> 03:00:36.718
MARISHA: I am the best!

03:00:36.718 --> 03:00:37.990
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:39.330
MARISHA: Fuck you, Gil.

03:00:39.330 --> 03:00:40.918
TRAVIS: Terrible, just awful.

03:00:40.918 --> 03:00:41.851
MARISHA: 11.

03:00:41.981 --> 03:00:43.771
LIAM: Wait, did you roll a 20 and an eight?

03:00:43.771 --> 03:00:45.709
MARISHA: No, I rolled my damage die.

03:00:45.709 --> 03:00:47.254
MATT: So it was an 11?

03:00:47.254 --> 03:00:49.156
MARISHA: For the first one.

03:00:49.156 --> 03:00:50.492
MATT: Misses.

03:00:50.492 --> 03:00:52.293
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Second one.

03:00:52.293 --> 03:00:53.830
LIAM: Come on, Beau.

03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:57.272
MARISHA: No! It's a two.

03:00:57.272 --> 03:01:01.417
MATT: It's just too tight. You can't quite get any
movement to hit it. It's a bad space for you.

03:01:01.417 --> 03:01:03.490
MARISHA: Oh wait, you said-- oh, disadvantage.

03:01:03.490 --> 03:01:05.198
TRAVIS: We're the best.

03:01:05.198 --> 03:01:11.977
MATT: That ends your turn. It is now Ulog's go.
Ulog is going to rush up and attempt to stab at it

03:01:11.977 --> 03:01:17.811
as he sees it wrapping around there. That is a 12.
That hits.

03:01:17.811 --> 03:01:20.283
TRAVIS: A 12 hits.

03:01:20.283 --> 03:01:21.253
MATT: Yeah, I know.

03:01:21.253 --> 03:01:22.398
TRAVIS: Guys.

03:01:22.398 --> 03:01:26.513
MATT: It does do sneak attack damage, because you
guys are in the vicinity.

03:01:26.513 --> 03:01:28.878
MARISHA: Wait, what?

03:01:28.878 --> 03:01:32.694
SAM: He's doing sneak attack damage to the carpet,
which translates to you.

03:01:32.694 --> 03:01:33.982
MARISHA: That's fine.

03:01:33.982 --> 03:01:42.319
MATT: He doesn't know. He's trying to help. That's
going to be 12 points of piercing damage, so six

03:01:42.319 --> 03:01:43.816
to the rug and six to you.

03:01:43.816 --> 03:01:45.073
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:01:45.073 --> 03:01:46.314
MARISHA: Ouch.

03:01:46.314 --> 03:01:49.211
MATT: The rug is starting to look a little torn up
in places and you can see bits of Beau showing

03:01:49.211 --> 03:01:52.145
through where the gashes are stabbing through.
It's looking fairly hurt.

03:01:52.145 --> 03:01:54.548
MARISHA: Bits of Beau. Bits of Beau are showing.

03:01:54.548 --> 03:01:55.889
LIAM: Who wore it best?

03:01:55.889 --> 03:02:02.832
MATT: It's the rug's turn. The rug is going to
attempt to shift itself and Beau a little bit away

03:02:02.832 --> 03:02:06.440
this direction. It can only get five feet because
its speed is halved pulling you along with it and

03:02:06.616 --> 03:02:11.688
its speed is ten. So Nott, you get an attack of
opportunity, if you want to take one.

03:02:14.448 --> 03:02:16.269
LAURA: It's looking weak.

03:02:16.534 --> 03:02:19.048
SAM: Sure, I'll swing a shortsword at it.

03:02:19.048 --> 03:02:22.015
MATT: You whip out your shortsword quickly.

03:02:22.015 --> 03:02:23.140
SAM: 21 to hit.

03:02:23.140 --> 03:02:26.934
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage with
sneak attack. If you want to sneak attack. You

03:02:26.934 --> 03:02:28.277
don't have to.

03:02:28.277 --> 03:02:36.928
SAM: Yeah, sure. If I'm going to hit it, I'm going
to hit it. (counting) 15.

03:02:36.928 --> 03:02:41.014
MATT: 15, all right. That's eight to the rug and
seven to Beau.

03:02:43.884 --> 03:02:45.239
SAM: Oh, she's out.

03:02:45.319 --> 03:02:47.465
LIAM: No, she's not out.
She's hanging on.

03:02:49.959 --> 03:02:56.017
MATT: The rug is barely holding on by a thread.
You see it still keeps her constrained. You see

03:02:56.176 --> 03:02:59.725
parts of it are fraying and falling apart. The
threads are dangling, but it's still keeping its

03:02:59.725 --> 03:03:04.078
mass strongly and tightly around her. It's still
crushing her and mainly wrapped around her face so

03:03:04.078 --> 03:03:09.600
she can't see and she can't breathe. That ends the
rug's turn. Caleb, you're up.

03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:10.800
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:12.273
MATT: You're up.

03:03:12.273 --> 03:03:15.941
LIAM: What am I doing? I rush forward and I am
going to try to pry the rug off of her.

03:03:15.941 --> 03:03:17.273
MATT: Make an athletics check.

03:03:17.273 --> 03:03:19.493
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. Come on, roll big. Nope.

03:03:22.485 --> 03:03:24.047
Athletics? <i>Nein</i>!

03:03:24.047 --> 03:03:25.551
ALL: <i>Nein</i>!

03:03:25.551 --> 03:03:29.363
MATT: There it is. You're trying to pull and you
get some threads that snap off and you're like

03:03:29.363 --> 03:03:32.024
"Shit!" It's not working. You're not getting the
right grasp on it.

03:03:32.024 --> 03:03:32.968
LIAM: Next.

03:03:32.968 --> 03:03:34.655
MATT: That ends Caleb's turn. Nott, you're up.

03:03:34.655 --> 03:03:36.668
SAM: Me? What about Jes?

03:03:36.668 --> 03:03:38.371
MATT: No, it's you and then Jester.

03:03:38.371 --> 03:03:45.381
SAM: Oh, that was a reaction. Well, I guess I see
how bad the rug is doing and I will swing that

03:03:45.381 --> 03:03:47.402
shortsword again. Why not?

03:03:47.402 --> 03:03:48.804
LAURA: Vengeance.

03:03:48.804 --> 03:03:52.507
SAM: It's a 15.

03:03:52.507 --> 03:03:56.030
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
If you want to do it with sneak attack, up to you.

03:03:56.198 --> 03:03:58.496
SAM: You said it was hanging by a thread, right?

03:03:58.496 --> 03:03:59.964
MATT: It looks like it’s doing pretty rough. It's
up to you.

03:03:59.964 --> 03:04:04.459
SAM: Maybe not sneak attack damage. Ooh, ten
points?

03:04:04.459 --> 03:04:07.115
(laughter)

03:04:07.115 --> 03:04:09.798
MATT: So that's five damage to Beau and the rug.

03:04:09.798 --> 03:04:13.659
MARISHA: Guys, this rug is expensi--

03:04:13.659 --> 03:04:18.132
MATT: You tear through the rug. You cut through
and the rug bisects, but you also see that where

03:04:18.132 --> 03:04:22.526
you cut through also cut across the front of Beau
as her eyes roll back and she plops onto the

03:04:22.526 --> 03:04:26.901
ground, the rug falling in pieces to the ground
around her, coming to rest.

03:04:26.901 --> 03:04:28.881
MARISHA: Don't let me bleed on it!

03:04:28.881 --> 03:04:33.621
SAM: Ah! What have I done?! Heal her!

03:04:33.621 --> 03:04:36.896
LAURA: I will. I cast Cure Wounds on her.

03:04:36.896 --> 03:04:39.943
MATT: Okay, go ahead and cast Cure Wounds to
heal.

03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:43.916
LAURA: Eight points.

03:04:43.916 --> 03:04:48.075
MARISHA: (gasps) I didn't bleed on it, did I? I
move off the rug so I don't bleed on it.

03:04:48.075 --> 03:04:51.583
MATT and LAURA: The rug is shredded.

03:04:51.583 --> 03:05:02.591
SAM: I'm going to cast Message. Remember the
hospital? That. You can reply to this message.

03:05:02.591 --> 03:05:05.119
(laughter)

03:05:05.119 --> 03:05:07.581
TRAVIS: It's going as well as the hospital.

03:05:07.581 --> 03:05:09.666
TALIESIN: That seems fair.

03:05:09.666 --> 03:05:12.863
LAURA: He's going to know we were in his room
because the rug is messed up.

03:05:12.863 --> 03:05:14.646
SAM: We'll fix it later.

03:05:14.646 --> 03:05:19.898
LIAM: That's okay, because if the plan goes
according to plan, yeah. Allow myself to introduce

03:05:19.898 --> 03:05:26.053
myself. If everything goes well, we get Orentha to
fall on both of these people at once. So let's

03:05:26.053 --> 03:05:27.963
finish what we're doing, <i>ja</i>?

03:05:28.045 --> 03:05:29.047
LAURA: Okay.

03:05:29.047 --> 03:05:32.797
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, doesn't matter. No one is going to
care about a rug or him screaming about a rug.

03:05:32.797 --> 03:05:35.601
LAURA: Okay. Let's gather up the pieces of the rug
so it's not, you know.

03:05:35.601 --> 03:05:37.849
MATT: So you gather all the pieces of the rug to
join your shingles.

03:05:37.849 --> 03:05:39.271
MARISHA: Scoop up the rug.

03:05:39.271 --> 03:05:41.110
LAURA: Check the fucking thing if it's trapped.

03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:43.109
LIAM: Check that armoire or whatever it is.

03:05:43.109 --> 03:05:44.908
LAURA: No, check the thing on the ground and see
if it's trapped first.

03:05:44.908 --> 03:05:46.290
LIAM: Check them both.

03:05:46.290 --> 03:05:50.955
SAM: I'll check the thing on the ground while Ulog
checks the thing on the mantelpiece or wherever it is.

03:05:51.130 --> 03:05:53.162
LIAM: He's got a safe and a floor.

03:05:53.162 --> 03:05:57.400
SAM: What am I checking? 14 on the thing on the
floor.

03:05:57.400 --> 03:06:02.609
MATT: It does not appear to be
trapped. It does appear to be locked. Roll again.

03:06:02.717 --> 03:06:03.721
LIAM: No more magic?

03:06:03.721 --> 03:06:05.017
MATT: Correct.

03:06:05.017 --> 03:06:06.987
SAM: 15 plus thieves' tools.

03:06:06.987 --> 03:06:09.954
MATT: Yeah, easy enough. (lock clicks) You manage
to open it up and there is a small chest about

03:06:09.954 --> 03:06:12.687
that big that rests in a small cubby beneath.

03:06:12.687 --> 03:06:14.987
SAM and LAURA: What does it have in it?

03:06:14.987 --> 03:06:18.081
MATT: As you open the chest, make a constitution
saving throw.

03:06:18.081 --> 03:06:19.161
SAM: Oh, shit.

03:06:23.261 --> 03:06:24.409
Ten.

03:06:24.409 --> 03:06:25.705
MATT: Okay.

03:06:25.705 --> 03:06:30.046
LIAM: Son of a gun.

03:06:30.046 --> 03:06:37.234
MATT: So first, there's a sudden burst of a brief
light through it, and all your muscles tense up

03:06:37.234 --> 03:06:40.036
and you are paralyzed.

03:06:40.036 --> 03:06:42.975
LIAM: Motherfucker.

03:06:48.365 --> 03:06:50.315
MARISHA: Okay. It's okay.

03:06:50.780 --> 03:06:52.166
LIAM: What about Ulog?

03:06:52.166 --> 03:06:53.396
MARISHA: What about Ulog?

03:06:53.396 --> 03:06:54.673
LIAM: Because it's simultaneous.

03:06:54.673 --> 03:06:57.201
MATT: Ulog goes, "No traps," and pulls it open. No
issue.

03:06:57.201 --> 03:06:59.222
LIAM: What is in there with Ulog?

03:06:59.222 --> 03:07:07.265
MATT: Inside with Ulog, you see a beautiful set of
burgundy and gold robes that are up hanging, you

03:07:07.265 --> 03:07:13.507
see a set of polished bracers made of cobalt steel
that are both dangling on a hook, and you see

03:07:13.507 --> 03:07:19.655
three ancient statuettes, like relics or
collector's items, that are arranged on the bottom

03:07:19.655 --> 03:07:23.721
of it that all look like old museum pieces.

03:07:23.721 --> 03:07:26.678
MARISHA: Do they have any symbols on them? On the
statues?

03:07:26.678 --> 03:07:29.743
LIAM: All magical, I assume. I assume they're
glowing.

03:07:29.743 --> 03:07:31.723
MATT: Are you still concentrating?

03:07:31.723 --> 03:07:34.220
LIAM: Yeah, I haven't cast anything that breaks
that.

03:07:34.220 --> 03:07:38.248
MATT: That's true, you didn't take any damage.
None of them are glowing except for the cobalt

03:07:38.248 --> 03:07:39.369
bracers.

03:07:41.599 --> 03:07:44.983
MARISHA: Do I recognize any symbols or see any
symbols on the statues?

03:07:45.066 --> 03:07:46.387
MATT: Make a history check.

03:07:49.448 --> 03:07:50.389
MARISHA: Ten.

03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:52.219
MATT: Ten. You do not, unfortunately.

03:07:52.219 --> 03:07:54.022
LIAM: Nott just collapsed on the floor,
paralyzed.

03:07:54.022 --> 03:07:55.929
LAURA: No, Nott's paralyzed holding onto the
chest.

03:07:55.929 --> 03:07:58.956
MATT: Holding to the chest. The chest which is now
open, in Nott's hand.

03:07:58.956 --> 03:08:03.440
LAURA: I am petting Nott's head and going: Don't
worry, in the morning, I can take a spell that

03:08:03.440 --> 03:08:09.502
will heal you, so we'll carry you out here, okay?
Everything will be fine.

03:08:09.502 --> 03:08:12.733
LIAM: I pull the chest free of Nott's hands. Is
this chest glowing?

03:08:12.733 --> 03:08:14.032
MATT: No.

03:08:14.032 --> 03:08:16.333
LAURA: No, it's got the seal in it. Does it have
the seal in it?

03:08:16.333 --> 03:08:22.877
MATT: On the inside there is a faint glow. If you
look inside, you see there's a cluster of platinum

03:08:22.877 --> 03:08:27.424
pieces. They're stacked on the side and have
shifted around from the movement. You see a single

03:08:27.424 --> 03:08:36.544
polished river stone, about that big, that is
giving a glowing aura, and you see a few sticks of

03:08:36.544 --> 03:08:39.280
wax and a single pressed wax seal.

03:08:39.280 --> 03:08:45.574
LAURA: Okay. I sit down. Oh, do we see his
handwriting anywhere? Any letters?

03:08:45.574 --> 03:08:49.586
MATT: You do not see in this vicinity any letters
or handwriting, no.

03:08:49.586 --> 03:08:53.386
MARISHA: It's okay. He always gets his squires to
do his dirty work. But we have the seal.

03:08:53.386 --> 03:08:58.417
LAURA: Okay. I'll sit down and I'll write a letter
really fast that says, "The plan--"

03:08:58.417 --> 03:09:01.608
MARISHA: He's working with the Myriad, and all
that stuff earlier.

03:09:01.608 --> 03:09:05.797
LIAM: We have that already. We did it in advance.
I start rooting through Nott's pockets to find the

03:09:05.797 --> 03:09:08.741
letter in Thieves' Cant.

03:09:08.741 --> 03:09:14.132
LAURA: No, that's different. Those are letters we
were leaving here.

03:09:14.132 --> 03:09:15.706
LIAM: Yeah, Thieves' Cant we're leaving here.

03:09:15.706 --> 03:09:16.454
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:16.454 --> 03:09:17.978
LIAM: So we should leave them here.

03:09:17.978 --> 03:09:22.667
MARISHA: But we wrote up the letters for the
High-Richter too, just so we can stamp.

03:09:22.667 --> 03:09:26.101
LAURA: We didn't actually write that letter yet
because I was waiting for his handwriting.

03:09:26.101 --> 03:09:30.393
MARISHA: Yeah we did because we put the Knights of
Requital in it. The KR symbol.

03:09:30.393 --> 03:09:32.914
LAURA: Sure, why not?

03:09:32.914 --> 03:09:36.905
LIAM: From Richter to Sutan we did, so we're
leaving those, and we're leaving a note--

03:09:36.905 --> 03:09:42.297
MATT: Marisha, make a perception check. You both
make perception checks.

03:09:42.297 --> 03:09:45.291
LIAM: Nott's fake Myriad note we're leaving here,
so I pull that out of Nott's pockets.

03:09:45.291 --> 03:09:46.326
MARISHA: 18.

03:09:46.326 --> 03:09:47.502
MATT: 18? You do glance--

03:09:47.502 --> 03:09:48.493
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:09:48.493 --> 03:09:49.553
TRAVIS: 17.

03:09:49.553 --> 03:09:52.275
MATT: Good to know. You glance off to the side and
there is a desk in the corner that has two sets of

03:09:52.275 --> 03:09:54.208
drawers that are currently closed.

03:09:54.208 --> 03:09:58.116
LIAM: While Jester and Caleb are arguing, Caleb
grabs the little magical stone that's in that box

03:09:58.116 --> 03:09:59.932
and puts it in his pocket.

03:09:59.932 --> 03:10:01.977
MATT: Okay. You grab it and put it in your
pocket.

03:10:01.977 --> 03:10:06.458
MARISHA: I stuff the letters that we were planting
on the High-Richter in the-- sorry, on Sutan into

03:10:06.458 --> 03:10:07.912
the safe.

03:10:07.912 --> 03:10:08.776
MATT: Okay.

03:10:08.776 --> 03:10:09.805
MARISHA: Close the safe.

03:10:09.805 --> 03:10:11.099
MATT: Okay (clicking).

03:10:11.099 --> 03:10:13.525
MARISHA: Run over to the desk, open the desk, look
through it. Do I see anything?

03:10:13.525 --> 03:10:20.956
MATT: Mostly it's just blank parchment. You do see
a few notes that are maybe partially written

03:10:20.956 --> 03:10:25.331
letters that were crumpled up and thrown in there
that are Lord Sutan's handwriting.

03:10:25.331 --> 03:10:26.499
LAURA: (gasps) Let me see!

03:10:26.499 --> 03:10:27.668
MARISHA: Yeah, go!

03:10:27.668 --> 03:10:31.584
LAURA: Okay! I look at it and then I sit down and
write the letter and go-- okay, what's her name?

03:10:31.584 --> 03:10:33.486
The High-Richter's letter's first name?

03:10:33.486 --> 03:10:34.886
TRAVIS: Prucine.

03:10:34.886 --> 03:10:36.638
MARISHA: Prucine! Dayana Prucine!

03:10:36.638 --> 03:10:41.896
LAURA: Dayana, okay. I'm going to write: Dayana,
got your message, our plan is moving forward

03:10:41.896 --> 03:10:48.475
exactly as we discussed. The Myriad has our back!

03:10:48.475 --> 03:10:49.704
MARISHA: Sure, yeah.

03:10:49.704 --> 03:10:52.043
LAURA: Sure. Then sign it Lord Sutan.

03:10:52.043 --> 03:10:53.245
MARISHA: Sure.

03:10:53.245 --> 03:10:56.510
LAURA: Oh! And something about the Big-O going
down.

03:10:56.510 --> 03:10:57.323
MARISHA: Yes!

03:10:57.323 --> 03:10:59.265
LAURA: The Big-O will go down.

03:10:59.265 --> 03:11:01.979
MARISHA: Tonight, plan happening, sooner than
later.

03:11:01.979 --> 03:11:06.921
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for your forgery
kit. So roll a d20, add your proficiency modifier

03:11:06.921 --> 03:11:09.607
and your intelligence modifier.

03:11:09.607 --> 03:11:11.610
TALIESIN: This is hard, being outside.

03:11:11.610 --> 03:11:12.854
MATT: I'm sorry, guys.

03:11:12.854 --> 03:11:14.806
TALIESIN: It's okay. Someone had to do it.

03:11:14.806 --> 03:11:24.021
LAURA: Roll my proficiency plus my intelligence.
Aw, my intelligence?! Why not wisdom?

03:11:24.152 --> 03:11:26.155
(laughter)

03:11:28.485 --> 03:11:29.860
LIAM: Got to do it.

03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:32.721
LAURA: Nine.

03:11:32.721 --> 03:11:36.134
MARISHA: Is there any way I can help her? Like
being also proficient in forging in this

03:11:36.134 --> 03:11:37.534
background and stuff?

03:11:37.534 --> 03:11:40.693
MATT: Sure. I'll say since you were helping her
that I'll give you advantage on the roll.

03:11:40.693 --> 03:11:41.571
LAURA: Advantage?

03:11:41.571 --> 03:11:43.922
MATT: Advantage on the roll. So roll one more
time.

03:11:45.741 --> 03:11:50.191
LAURA: (sighs) Ooh, that's so much better! 22!

03:11:50.191 --> 03:11:55.767
MATT: You start making one and it's not quite
working out and Beau looks over your shoulder,

03:11:55.767 --> 03:11:57.106
points it out, you take it--

03:11:57.106 --> 03:11:58.390
MARISHA: Ah, you forgot the hooks on the G's!

03:11:58.390 --> 03:12:01.627
MATT: You throw it in the fireplace and incinerate
that one and then make another one. This one is

03:12:01.627 --> 03:12:03.835
pretty solid and it matches the writing
perfectly.

03:12:03.835 --> 03:12:05.288
LAURA: This is really good.

03:12:05.288 --> 03:12:07.196
MARISHA: Wow, yes! It looks amazing. You should be
proud.

03:12:07.196 --> 03:12:09.724
LAURA: I roll it up, heat up the wax, seal it--

03:12:09.724 --> 03:12:11.557
MATT: (hissing) Done.

03:12:11.557 --> 03:12:16.863
LAURA: Put the letter in the bag. We have it for
later. Then I go and pick up Nott. Let's get out of here.

03:12:16.863 --> 03:12:18.574
MARISHA: Let's get the <i>fuck</i> out of here.

03:12:18.574 --> 03:12:21.578
LIAM: We've left the Thieves’ Cant note from the
"Myriad" and we've left the--

03:12:21.578 --> 03:12:23.284
Yeah? Everything that we've planned?

03:12:23.445 --> 03:12:25.514
LAURA: Does anyone have any books around?

03:12:25.514 --> 03:12:29.691
MATT: In the current room? There is a shelf in the
hallway that you can see that has a few books.

03:12:29.691 --> 03:12:31.735
LIAM: Is anything glowing there though, Matthew?

03:12:31.735 --> 03:12:32.786
MATT: No there's nothing glowing.

03:12:32.786 --> 03:12:33.895
LIAM: Okay.

03:12:33.895 --> 03:12:36.527
LAURA: I'm going to take out one of the pamphlets
for the Traveler and stick it into one of the

03:12:36.527 --> 03:12:37.513
books.

03:12:37.513 --> 03:12:38.835
MATT: Okay.

03:12:38.835 --> 03:12:40.446
LAURA: Okay, and then I pick up Nott!

03:12:40.446 --> 03:12:45.681
MATT: You guys make your way back up to the
entranceway up into the crawlspace above the

03:12:45.681 --> 03:12:51.235
attic, pull it closed and latch it. You move the
art piece back over. You make your way back to the

03:12:51.235 --> 03:12:55.045
edge of the roof where you guys had exited,
climbing the ladder that's attached to it, making

03:12:55.045 --> 03:12:59.234
your way onto the roof, getting Nott up there,
manhandled, Ulog following you as you get to the

03:12:59.234 --> 03:13:00.655
top. You close it--

03:13:00.655 --> 03:13:02.485
MARISHA: Put some shingles back.

03:13:02.584 --> 03:13:06.002
MATT: You put the shingles back in the space. For
that, I'm going to have to have you both roll

03:13:06.002 --> 03:13:09.518
dexterity checks, please. Or, since you're
helping, have you roll a dexterity check with

03:13:09.518 --> 03:13:11.332
advantage, because you're helping her.

03:13:11.332 --> 03:13:14.990
MARISHA: Okay. Just straight dexterity?

03:13:14.990 --> 03:13:15.730
MATT: Yes.

03:13:15.730 --> 03:13:16.763
MARISHA: 15.

03:13:16.763 --> 03:13:19.141
MATT: 15. Okay. You manage to find and arrange
them in a way where they aren't going to slide off

03:13:19.141 --> 03:13:22.255
and even with a bit of rain that's in there you
find the pockets where they originally, mostly

03:13:22.255 --> 03:13:25.413
sitting so they're not going to coast with any
sort of weather shift.

03:13:25.413 --> 03:13:27.112
MARISHA: It looks all right, right? Okay.

03:13:27.112 --> 03:13:30.544
LAURA: I pick up Nott. I walk her as we tiptoe
across the roof.

03:13:30.544 --> 03:13:34.002
MATT: All right. You guys are noticing at this
point as they're on the roof, because you're

03:13:34.002 --> 03:13:37.167
paying attention you see them begin to emerge on
the roof as you begin to see a cluster of

03:13:37.167 --> 03:13:41.038
crownsguard doing a pass through the street.

03:13:41.038 --> 03:13:44.430
TALIESIN: So I know that we can see if they're
coming through?

03:13:44.430 --> 03:13:46.091
MATT: Yeah.

03:13:46.091 --> 03:13:51.819
TALIESIN: We may need to distract. I'm going to:
Go fuck with the dog. I push the cat away with

03:13:51.819 --> 03:13:54.870
that. And do you want to go out?

03:13:54.870 --> 03:13:56.143
TRAVIS: Do what?

03:13:56.143 --> 03:13:58.138
TALIESIN: Do you want-- we distract Crownsguard?

03:13:58.138 --> 03:14:00.714
TRAVIS: Yes, of course. Yeah. (clears throat)

03:14:00.714 --> 03:14:05.373
MATT: There's four of them that are approaching
and they're going by and keeping an eye on things.

03:14:05.720 --> 03:14:07.831
TRAVIS: I walk up to the four of them.

03:14:07.831 --> 03:14:09.219
MATT: Okay.

03:14:09.219 --> 03:14:12.986
TRAVIS: I heard there's a disturbance over here. I
need some assistance, please.

03:14:12.986 --> 03:14:15.187
MATT: "What kind of disturbance?"

03:14:15.187 --> 03:14:18.200
TRAVIS: There's a rowdy bunch over here, been
drinking too much already, anticipating the

03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:20.200
festival. Would you come with me?

03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:21.829
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:14:22.853 --> 03:14:24.793
TRAVIS: Oh, god. 13.

03:14:24.826 --> 03:14:26.558
TALIESIN: Can I assist?

03:14:26.558 --> 03:14:28.833
MATT: Technically, no because you weren't part of
it.

03:14:28.833 --> 03:14:30.195
TALIESIN: I was about to-- yeah, I know, yeah.

03:14:30.195 --> 03:14:31.850
MATT: Had to catch it before the roll,
unfortunately.

03:14:31.850 --> 03:14:33.104
TALIESIN: All right.

03:14:33.104 --> 03:14:38.352
MATT: That's okay, (chuckles) he rolled a one. The
snitch isn't working for me tonight.

03:14:38.352 --> 03:14:40.873
LAURA: Oh god. <i>Move</i>.

03:14:40.873 --> 03:14:45.211
MATT: So the two of them don't seem to quite buy
into it, but the two of them that go, "Well, all

03:14:45.211 --> 03:14:51.304
right. We'll follow. Lead on." Leads the three--
you jog along. Two of them continue their route.

03:14:51.304 --> 03:14:54.296
TALIESIN: How's your evening going gentlemen?

03:14:54.296 --> 03:14:57.250
MATT: "Keep moving along."

03:14:57.250 --> 03:15:00.980
TALIESIN: Want a free tarot reading? I'm on a
five-minute break for the entertainment.

03:15:00.980 --> 03:15:04.183
MATT: "We're all right, but thank you." They keep
walking.

03:15:04.183 --> 03:15:06.954
TALIESIN: I sent the cat, so the cat should be--

03:15:06.954 --> 03:15:09.862
LIAM: Yeah. (angry meow)

03:15:09.862 --> 03:15:14.615
MATT: Frumpkin makes his way around. (barking)
Again, the dog unleashes a torrent of barks, like

03:15:14.752 --> 03:15:18.234
"No, not again!" You hear the other guy being
pulled across the yard. He's being dragged through

03:15:18.234 --> 03:15:23.264
the wet grass. You guys begin to make your way
across. Who's carrying Nott across?

03:15:23.264 --> 03:15:24.586
LAURA: I will.

03:15:24.586 --> 03:15:25.671
LIAM: Yeah.

03:15:25.671 --> 03:15:30.520
LAURA: I'm going to try to hook Nott over me. So
like she's attached.

03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:34.259
MATT: Make an athletics check as you try to make
your way across the rope.

03:15:34.259 --> 03:15:35.429
TRAVIS: We've got this.

03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:38.087
MARISHA: I'm going to try to hold the rope as hard
as I can. (grunts)

03:15:38.087 --> 03:15:40.107
LIAM: Athletics check? For everybody, right?

03:15:40.107 --> 03:15:41.802
MARISHA: Oh come on, girl.

03:15:41.802 --> 03:15:43.031
LAURA: Five.

03:15:43.031 --> 03:15:45.022
MARISHA: Fuck! That's not good.

03:15:45.022 --> 03:15:47.300
TRAVIS: (chuckling) You pulling your eyebrows
off?

03:15:47.300 --> 03:15:52.057
MATT: So do you want to save yourself or Nott?
Because one of you is falling.

03:15:52.057 --> 03:15:54.531
LAURA: I save Nott and I'll fall.

03:15:54.531 --> 03:16:01.771
MATT: As you grasp, you loop Nott around the rope.
As you lose your grip, feeling it coming and you

03:16:01.771 --> 03:16:05.024
tumble down.

03:16:05.152 --> 03:16:07.249
Falling three stories.

03:16:07.249 --> 03:16:09.280
TALIESIN: That many stories?

03:16:09.280 --> 03:16:10.772
LAURA: Three stories.

03:16:10.772 --> 03:16:13.029
MARISHA: I know. We were three stories up.

03:16:13.029 --> 03:16:17.272
MATT: So you take 12 points of bludgeoning damage
as you crack! Hit the ground.

03:16:17.272 --> 03:16:20.885
LAURA: (pained) Oh. Thaumaturgy. Thunder.

03:16:20.885 --> 03:16:23.970
MATT: As you impact, the two guards that were
talking to you and chatting,

03:16:24.068 --> 03:16:28.296
immediately whip around and see Jester on
the ground and put their hands on their weapons

03:16:28.296 --> 03:16:29.876
and begin rushing towards her.

03:16:29.945 --> 03:16:31.188
LAURA: Am I on the outside of the--

03:16:31.188 --> 03:16:32.563
MATT: You're on the outside of the fence, yeah.

03:16:32.563 --> 03:16:33.568
LAURA: Okay, that's great.

03:16:33.568 --> 03:16:35.244
MATT: Like just barely. You just missed the wall.

03:16:35.244 --> 03:16:36.925
MARISHA: Do I have Nott on the rope?

03:16:36.925 --> 03:16:39.648
MATT: Nott is up on the rope, hanging and
dangling.

03:16:39.648 --> 03:16:44.457
MARISHA: Can I pull Nott up and roll over and hide
on the rope? Or on the roof?

03:16:44.457 --> 03:16:46.487
MATT: Sure. You tug her over onto the roof.

03:16:46.487 --> 03:16:48.094
TALIESIN: There you are, dear!

03:16:48.094 --> 03:16:49.350
LAURA: Am I 12 damage?

03:16:49.350 --> 03:16:50.586
MATT: 12 damage.

03:16:50.586 --> 03:16:51.448
LAURA: Okay.

03:16:51.448 --> 03:16:52.967
TALIESIN: I'm running with them to see what
happened.

03:16:53.046 --> 03:16:57.270
There you are dear! Good god! There were
those hooligans that were roughing us up earlier.

03:16:57.270 --> 03:16:58.633
Are you all right?

03:16:58.633 --> 03:17:00.437
LAURA: They hurt me so bad.

03:17:00.437 --> 03:17:03.639
TALIESIN: I knew you were going to be okay,
anyway. Do you mind helping?

03:17:03.639 --> 03:17:05.248
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:17:05.248 --> 03:17:07.020
TALIESIN: I know. Fucking--

03:17:07.020 --> 03:17:08.055
TRAVIS: Come on!

03:17:08.055 --> 03:17:09.629
LIAM: Come on, Tal!

03:17:09.629 --> 03:17:11.455
TALIESIN: Nope. Four.

03:17:11.455 --> 03:17:13.757
LAURA: But I was helping because I'm bloody.

03:17:13.757 --> 03:17:15.242
MATT: You should have said before the roll.

03:17:15.242 --> 03:17:17.093
(groaning)

03:17:17.093 --> 03:17:24.265
MATT: Okay. They both go "All right, miss." They
pick you up and the other guy takes your arm and is like--

03:17:24.344 --> 03:17:26.309
TALIESIN: Hey, I'm only a little drunk.

03:17:26.309 --> 03:17:28.886
MATT: "Right. All right." They drag you and start
bringing you towards the gates out of the

03:17:28.886 --> 03:17:30.248
Tri-Spire.

03:17:30.248 --> 03:17:31.766
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:17:31.766 --> 03:17:34.016
MARISHA: So wait, she was on the other side of the
gate?

03:17:34.016 --> 03:17:35.066
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:17:35.066 --> 03:17:35.926
MARISHA: Okay.

03:17:35.926 --> 03:17:36.814
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:17:36.814 --> 03:17:38.142
MATT: So you two make your way--

03:17:38.142 --> 03:17:41.696
LAURA: But I'm staying at the Pillow Trove
tonight.

03:17:41.696 --> 03:17:44.964
MATT: "Miss, you've got to sober up and you can
find your way back tomorrow morning." So they

03:17:44.964 --> 03:17:48.868
escort you out of the Tri-Spire. You guys are
pushed beyond the gates and there's now eight

03:17:48.868 --> 03:17:52.101
guards at each gate that are preventing any
passage in and out. You guys are shoved back out

03:17:52.101 --> 03:17:53.299
into the city.

03:17:53.299 --> 03:17:56.735
TALIESIN: You're a gofficer and a nentleman. Thank
you very much.

03:17:56.735 --> 03:18:01.404
MATT: However, that distraction gives you guys
enough time to get the rest of you over and down

03:18:01.404 --> 03:18:03.726
to the beyond the tree.

03:18:03.726 --> 03:18:08.723
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. I like do a climber's loop
harness and tie Nott around me, around my middle

03:18:08.723 --> 03:18:10.721
section and then get over.

03:18:10.747 --> 03:18:13.066
MATT: Okay. So you guys all get across. You
leaving the rope there or are you detaching it?

03:18:13.066 --> 03:18:14.605
MARISHA: No, I'm trying to detach it if I can. No
trace.

03:18:14.605 --> 03:18:15.815
MATT: Okay.

03:18:15.815 --> 03:18:17.307
TRAVIS: I love his facial expressions from here.

03:18:17.307 --> 03:18:18.787
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

03:18:18.787 --> 03:18:20.896
LIAM: Work that shit. This is--

03:18:22.394 --> 03:18:25.730
MARISHA: Fucking-- Gil! Gil, you're a piece of
shit today!

03:18:25.730 --> 03:18:26.868
MATT: Aw, Gil.

03:18:26.868 --> 03:18:28.512
MARISHA: Six. I love you, Gil.

03:18:28.512 --> 03:18:32.146
LIAM: How far away is where the grapple is hooked
from us right now?

03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:33.656
MATT: It's about ten feet from you.

03:18:33.656 --> 03:18:39.689
LIAM: I cast Unseen Servant. Schmidt lifts up the
grapple and tosses it free.

03:18:39.689 --> 03:18:44.510
MATT: Okay. The rope does break, and the grapple
bends. The grapple's not usable anymore. You do

03:18:44.510 --> 03:18:46.823
remove the evidence, but the grapple’s not usable
at the moment.

03:18:46.823 --> 03:18:48.498
MARISHA: Your lips are getting purple again.

03:18:48.498 --> 03:18:50.059
TRAVIS: Faces of death.

03:18:50.184 --> 03:18:59.608
MATT: As you guys pull yourselves away from the
vicinity about 45 minutes later as you guys are

03:18:59.608 --> 03:19:03.546
collecting yourselves eventually the paralysis
wears off.

03:19:03.546 --> 03:19:04.619
LAURA: Oh.

03:19:04.619 --> 03:19:06.532
MATT: It lasted for an hour total.

03:19:06.532 --> 03:19:07.806
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:19:07.806 --> 03:19:08.970
LIAM: Wow.

03:19:08.970 --> 03:19:10.218
TALIESIN: You had time to think about that.

03:19:10.218 --> 03:19:12.393
SAM: The chest is trapped.

03:19:12.935 --> 03:19:14.593
MATT: What are you guys doing?

03:19:14.593 --> 03:19:19.237
LAURA: We are booking it to try to get to the
sewer entrance so we can get back in.

03:19:19.237 --> 03:19:21.226
MARISHA: It will-- I guess--

03:19:21.226 --> 03:19:22.702
TALIESIN: Wait, yeah.

03:19:22.702 --> 03:19:24.949
MARISHA: We'll try and meet up with these guys?

03:19:24.949 --> 03:19:26.650
LIAM: We need to get to our next target
immediately.

03:19:26.650 --> 03:19:27.936
MARISHA: We need to get to our next target.

03:19:27.936 --> 03:19:29.504
LAURA: I've got the fucking letters.

03:19:29.504 --> 03:19:33.677
MARISHA: Correct. So they'll know to meet us
there.

03:19:33.677 --> 03:19:35.319
LIAM: Everybody's going to the same place.

03:19:35.319 --> 03:19:40.286
MARISHA: Correct. Let's get there and then we'll
wait for Jester and Jester.

03:19:40.317 --> 03:19:44.241
MATT: Yeah. Ulog pulls out a pocket watch and he
looks and it and is like "Oh, she better fucking

03:19:44.241 --> 03:19:52.518
hurry up. Let's go." You guys make your way over
towards where the High-Richter's home is.

03:19:52.518 --> 03:19:54.121
SAM: How is she going to get back in to the--

03:19:54.121 --> 03:19:55.932
TALIESIN: We can disguise you.

03:19:55.932 --> 03:19:57.159
MATT: The two of you guys head back--

03:19:57.159 --> 03:19:58.451
LAURA: Oh yeah, I have the disguise charm.

03:19:58.451 --> 03:20:00.277
TALIESIN: Well, no, the charm won't work.

03:20:00.277 --> 03:20:02.180
MATT: You guys are heading back to where the sewer
is, you're saying?

03:20:02.180 --> 03:20:04.787
TALIESIN: I was thinking about pushing straight
through the front door again.

03:20:06.107 --> 03:20:07.729
LAURA: You want to try?

03:20:07.813 --> 03:20:09.728
TALIESIN: I've got a coat and a mask.

03:20:09.728 --> 03:20:11.394
LAURA: Is there another entrance we can go to?

03:20:11.394 --> 03:20:13.777
MATT: There is another entrance. It's on the
northern side.

03:20:13.777 --> 03:20:16.007
LAURA: Well, it'll probably be faster to do that
than to go--

03:20:16.007 --> 03:20:17.421
MATT: Could be.

03:20:17.421 --> 03:20:19.260
LAURA: Okay. We'll book it to the other entrance.

03:20:19.260 --> 03:20:23.914
MATT: Okay, you rush around through the street.
You make your way back to the northern gate to the

03:20:23.914 --> 03:20:27.833
district and there there is another nine or ten
guards stationed, with one on the top of the wall

03:20:27.833 --> 03:20:29.253
with their crossbow ready.

03:20:29.331 --> 03:20:30.563
LAURA: I'm pristine and sober.

03:20:30.563 --> 03:20:34.445
MATT: As you approach, "Hey! Sorry, no entry. The
gala is tonight."

03:20:34.445 --> 03:20:39.216
LAURA: I know. We're going to the gala.
Obviously.

03:20:39.216 --> 03:20:40.956
TALIESIN: Masked.

03:20:40.956 --> 03:20:43.295
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:20:43.892 --> 03:20:47.032
SAM: Because all the checks tonight have been so
good.

03:20:47.032 --> 03:20:49.302
MATT: I know. The rolls have been phenomenal.

03:20:49.302 --> 03:20:50.878
LAURA: Okay! 18.

03:20:50.878 --> 03:20:51.657
MATT: 18?

03:20:51.657 --> 03:20:53.171
LAURA: Yes.

03:20:53.171 --> 03:20:55.516
MATT: Gives you both a look over.

03:20:56.906 --> 03:20:58.046
"All right, then."

03:20:59.866 --> 03:21:01.767
LAURA: We run as soon as we’re in.

03:21:01.866 --> 03:21:07.954
MARISHA: How long were we waiting there? Were we
waiting long enough to where we can take a short

03:21:07.954 --> 03:21:09.719
rest?

03:21:09.719 --> 03:21:12.866
MATT: Yeah. Because of-- yeah, you can take a
short rest.

03:21:12.866 --> 03:21:14.040
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

03:21:14.040 --> 03:21:15.570
MATT: You get that back.

03:21:15.570 --> 03:21:20.133
LAURA: I guess I'll cast Cure Wounds on myself as
we're running.

03:21:20.133 --> 03:21:21.733
SAM: Short rest? Can we use hit dice?

03:21:21.733 --> 03:21:23.356
MARISHA: Yes, we can.

03:21:23.423 --> 03:21:25.726
MATT: So you guys get to use hit dice, they do
not.

03:21:25.726 --> 03:21:27.018
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

03:21:27.018 --> 03:21:29.021
LAURA: Okay, eight points healed.

03:21:29.021 --> 03:21:30.034
TALIESIN: That's nice.

03:21:30.034 --> 03:21:31.434
LAURA: Yeah.

03:21:31.434 --> 03:21:35.624
SAM: Psst, Marisha, how do you tell how many hit
dice you have?

03:21:35.624 --> 03:21:40.615
MARISHA: It is generally your level plus whatever
your class is. So I'm 1d8 plus three.

03:21:40.615 --> 03:21:42.099
TALIESIN: It's in your short rest button.

03:21:42.099 --> 03:21:42.916
SAM: It is?

03:21:43.006 --> 03:21:45.184
MARISHA: Oh no, sorry. I currently have 3d8.

03:21:45.184 --> 03:21:46.896
TALIESIN: Short rest is down at the bottom.

03:21:46.896 --> 03:21:48.383
MATT: There you go.

03:21:48.383 --> 03:21:52.990
LAURA: Okay. So we're trying to avoid the guard so
we don't get spotted again and get kicked out again.

03:21:52.990 --> 03:21:59.092
MATT: Yeah. You guys carefully find a space that's
away and out of sight, probably by one of the

03:21:59.092 --> 03:22:05.169
small fountains on the side and you all sit there
and rest for a bit, having drinks. Eventually, you

03:22:05.169 --> 03:22:09.454
guys manage to catch up with the rest of the group
as they're finishing their short rest. You've

03:22:09.454 --> 03:22:12.409
reconvened, you have your materials.

03:22:12.409 --> 03:22:19.589
LAURA: That went really well, I think. Did we put
everything back in order before we left the room?

03:22:19.589 --> 03:22:21.661
We did, right? Yes, we did.

03:22:21.661 --> 03:22:27.142
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, good enough. The only thing
that's going to be obviously missing is the fucking rug!

03:22:27.284 --> 03:22:28.626
LAURA: The magical rug.

03:22:28.626 --> 03:22:38.005
MARISHA: I wasn't anticipating a rug. But we beat
the rug. Get it? We beat the-- we <i>beat</i> it.

03:22:38.005 --> 03:22:40.071
TALIESIN: Is this a thing that really happened?

03:22:40.071 --> 03:22:42.540
LAURA: Yeah, there was a rug that turned to life
and attacked us.

03:22:42.540 --> 03:22:45.852
MATT: Ulog's staring at his pocket watch, again
looking off at the gala in the distance, is like

03:22:45.852 --> 03:22:48.361
"All right, if we're going to fucking do
something, let's do it."

03:22:48.361 --> 03:22:51.154
LAURA: Let's go! We go to the High-Richter's
house.

03:22:51.154 --> 03:22:55.541
MARISHA: Ulog. How much longer do you think is
left of this gala?

03:22:55.541 --> 03:23:06.292
MATT: "Ah," and he looks off and is like, "I don't
know. Fuck it. Let's go now. I can't wait any longer."

03:23:06.429 --> 03:23:12.338
MARISHA: Molly. If the High-Richter tries to come
back, you have to drunkenly distract her. Okay?

03:23:12.338 --> 03:23:15.168
You cannot let her come in this house.

03:23:15.168 --> 03:23:17.729
SAM: How are we getting into this house?

03:23:17.729 --> 03:23:19.470
MARISHA: Well, we scouted it before.

03:23:19.470 --> 03:23:21.395
SAM: Yeah. We found out that there's a door.

03:23:21.395 --> 03:23:22.795
MARISHA: And more guards.

03:23:22.795 --> 03:23:24.396
SAM: But that doesn't give us a way in.

03:23:24.396 --> 03:23:25.930
MARISHA: Same plan. Just go with it.

03:23:25.930 --> 03:23:26.946
SAM: But there's no trees!

03:23:26.946 --> 03:23:28.592
MARISHA: Shut up! There is!

03:23:28.592 --> 03:23:30.378
LAURA and MARISHA: Are there trees?

03:23:30.378 --> 03:23:35.604
MATT: No. You're on the outskirts of the home, and
you've been here once before, this wall is not an

03:23:35.604 --> 03:23:41.785
iron gate. It's an actual solid, tall stone and
mason wall that’s pretty tight. There's maybe a

03:23:41.785 --> 03:23:45.321
three-foot gap between the side of the house, like
three or four-foot gap from the side of the house

03:23:45.321 --> 03:23:52.446
to this. The building is two stories. There is the
upper balcony that overlooks the whole exterior of

03:23:52.446 --> 03:23:57.778
the area before it. There are the two guards at
the front.

03:23:57.778 --> 03:24:01.067
SAM: We need to take them out and go through the
front door.

03:24:01.067 --> 03:24:02.366
LAURA: Maybe-- Fjord.

03:24:02.366 --> 03:24:05.175
TRAVIS: Do you want to look like the High-Richter
and walk in without saying anything?

03:24:05.175 --> 03:24:06.202
SAM: <i>You?</i>

03:24:06.202 --> 03:24:08.626
LAURA: You want to be a guard and I can look like
the High-Richter?

03:24:08.626 --> 03:24:09.524
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

03:24:09.524 --> 03:24:10.443
LAURA: Okay.

03:24:10.443 --> 03:24:12.091
MARISHA: We met the High-Richter before, you know.
Yeah.

03:24:12.091 --> 03:24:13.539
LAURA: Yes. Okay.

03:24:13.539 --> 03:24:16.343
TRAVIS: Yep, I'll Disguise Self to look like a
crownsguard.

03:24:16.343 --> 03:24:18.979
LAURA: I cast Disguise Self and look like the
High-Richter.

03:24:18.979 --> 03:24:21.139
MATT: Okay. In what outfit?

03:24:21.139 --> 03:24:23.123
LAURA: (muttering) Oh, god.

03:24:23.153 --> 03:24:24.935
MARISHA: She had ceremonial armor--

03:24:24.935 --> 03:24:28.322
LAURA: Yes, but she was probably going to the gala
tonight.

03:24:28.322 --> 03:24:31.430
MARISHA: That was gold and white ceremonial armor.
Yeah, but I'm sure--

03:24:31.430 --> 03:24:34.609
SAM: Wait, before you do this, why don't we go to
the festival and see what she looks like?

03:24:34.609 --> 03:24:35.825
MARISHA: We don't have time.

03:24:35.825 --> 03:24:37.091
LAURA: There's no time.

03:24:37.091 --> 03:24:38.779
LIAM: What if she came home with some crazy
outfit? Crazy cloak.

03:24:38.779 --> 03:24:44.540
LAURA: I'm going to put her in a cloak that looks
like it had wine spilled on it. Like, covering up

03:24:44.540 --> 03:24:47.122
the rest of the outfit, a big--

03:24:47.122 --> 03:24:48.527
SAM: A <i>white</i> cloak?

03:24:48.527 --> 03:24:54.146
LAURA: A white cloak that looks like it had red
wine spilled down the front. Fjord, you explain to

03:24:54.146 --> 03:24:58.024
the guards that I'm very pissed off because
someone spilled their drink on me.

03:24:59.144 --> 03:25:00.122
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:25:00.122 --> 03:25:02.692
MATT: All right. What are the rest of you guys
doing?

03:25:03.153 --> 03:25:06.691
SAM: I'm going to go around and see if there's any
other entrances, or if there's any other guards

03:25:06.691 --> 03:25:08.071
around the perimeter.

03:25:08.071 --> 03:25:10.154
MARISHA: I join Nott. We'll flank.

03:25:10.154 --> 03:25:13.438
MATT: Make a perception check with advantage,
because they're helping you on this one.

03:25:13.438 --> 03:25:15.536
SAM: Okay, seven.

03:25:15.536 --> 03:25:17.575
MARISHA: What the fuck?

03:25:17.575 --> 03:25:21.625
MATT: You don't see any secret entrances, you
don't see any other gates. Looks like the front

03:25:21.625 --> 03:25:26.144
door is the main way to get in, or over the wall.
There is no one watching the back, as it is a

03:25:26.144 --> 03:25:30.031
solid gate. It seems like the only entrance is
from the front, and that's probably intentional

03:25:30.031 --> 03:25:31.381
from a defensive standpoint.

03:25:31.381 --> 03:25:33.229
LIAM: How high is the wall?

03:25:33.229 --> 03:25:37.627
MATT: The wall is about-- let me check real fast.
This would be seven-foot.

03:25:37.704 --> 03:25:42.075
LIAM: Seven foot? Frumpkin's on top of the wall.
What do I see?

03:25:42.075 --> 03:25:50.145
MATT: You glance down. A small area of wildflower
and natural bushes have grown to fill the space in

03:25:50.145 --> 03:26:00.578
between, where it's thigh-high. There is a door in
the back, near the wall, with a small yard, maybe

03:26:00.578 --> 03:26:07.193
a ten-foot yard, towards the very back area.
There's a small porch area with nice chair and a

03:26:07.193 --> 03:26:12.136
little reading nook. There's a book left outside
that looks like it got rained on and forgotten,

03:26:12.136 --> 03:26:16.432
it's dried and crinkled. There is a door that
leads in from the back of that porch area there.

03:26:16.432 --> 03:26:18.223
LIAM: Are there any people?

03:26:18.223 --> 03:26:19.900
MATT: There are no people in the back.

03:26:19.900 --> 03:26:21.719
MARISHA: You want me to give you a boost?

03:26:21.719 --> 03:26:27.245
LIAM: Yeah. I relayed that all to them. There's
nobody back there, right? Yeah. Seven feet tall. Easy.

03:26:27.339 --> 03:26:30.920
MARISHA: Nott, come on, ready? Me and Caleb. One,
two, three.

03:26:30.920 --> 03:26:32.351
SAM: (squeals)

03:26:32.351 --> 03:26:35.215
MATT: Make an athletics check. Sorry, acrobatics,
for you.

03:26:35.215 --> 03:26:36.754
LAURA: Why are you going in?

03:26:36.754 --> 03:26:38.717
MARISHA: Just in case? Backup.

03:26:40.087 --> 03:26:41.003
SAM: 17.

03:26:41.056 --> 03:26:46.504
MATT: Without even touching the wall, you
double-flip in the air and land, ever so silently.

03:26:46.504 --> 03:26:51.309
You almost land on the book table, causing it to
knock over, but you just miss it. You're there

03:26:51.309 --> 03:26:54.287
quietly now, there's the door across the way. What
are you guys doing?

03:26:54.287 --> 03:26:55.777
TRAVIS: We're going in.

03:26:55.777 --> 03:26:57.700
LAURA: We're disguised and we're walking straight
up.

03:26:57.700 --> 03:26:59.556
MATT: You approach the two guards and they both
look at each other.

03:26:59.556 --> 03:27:01.119
LAURA: I look incredibly angry.

03:27:01.119 --> 03:27:04.566
TRAVIS: I'm about ten feet in front of her, and I
walk up. All right lads, open up. She's in one of

03:27:04.566 --> 03:27:08.076
her moods. Had wine spilled all over her. Hurry
up!

03:27:08.076 --> 03:27:09.386
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:27:09.386 --> 03:27:10.800
SAM: This is it.

03:27:12.553 --> 03:27:13.964
TRAVIS: 22.

03:27:13.964 --> 03:27:16.745
MATT: 22. They both go, "Oh, shit. Right in."

03:27:16.745 --> 03:27:19.164
TRAVIS: Quickly, I like this detail. Open up.

03:27:19.164 --> 03:27:22.413
MATT: One pulls out the key unlocks the gate. They
open from each side as you rush through. Make a

03:27:22.413 --> 03:27:24.265
deception check for you as well.

03:27:24.265 --> 03:27:26.513
LAURA: Just walking?! Why? I'm walking!

03:27:26.513 --> 03:27:28.969
MATT: With advantage, because you're dressed as
her.

03:27:28.969 --> 03:27:31.375
SAM: Thank god. Much better.

03:27:31.375 --> 03:27:34.007
LAURA: That's 18.

03:27:34.007 --> 03:27:43.129
MATT: They both go, "Ma'am." They both pull back,
frightened. You go to the front door. It's locked.

03:27:43.129 --> 03:27:44.229
SAM: Oh, no.

03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:50.490
TRAVIS: You fools, open the door. Don't you
see she's in a state?

03:27:50.609 --> 03:27:54.431
MATT: One of them rushes forward and unlocks it,
glancing out of the side of his eye towards you, shaking.

03:27:54.431 --> 03:27:55.747
LAURA: I breathe really hard.

03:27:55.747 --> 03:27:59.892
TRAVIS: I am so sorry, High-Richter. I assure you,
this night is almost over. Would you hurry up?!

03:27:59.892 --> 03:28:02.548
MATT: "Gah!" Opens the door and it throws open.

03:28:02.548 --> 03:28:04.728
TRAVIS: I follow in behind her.

03:28:04.728 --> 03:28:06.591
MATT: They close the door quietly behind you.

03:28:06.591 --> 03:28:09.243
LAURA and TRAVIS: (breathe deeply)

03:28:09.243 --> 03:28:11.191
LAURA: Is anybody inside the house?

03:28:11.191 --> 03:28:15.446
MATT: No. It is dark. There is no light source on
the inside right now.

03:28:15.446 --> 03:28:18.054
TRAVIS: I've got darkvision. Can I see anything?

03:28:18.054 --> 03:28:21.126
MATT: It's low light through the vicinity. You see
the interior chamber that is--

03:28:21.126 --> 03:28:24.529
MARISHA: (hyperventilating)

03:28:24.529 --> 03:28:36.278
MATT: It is gaudy as fuck in here. You see all the
walls have really intricate siding and there's

03:28:36.278 --> 03:28:41.806
inset designs that are carved into it, with
statues and busts of various elven figures. The

03:28:41.806 --> 03:28:45.820
main chamber leads to a spiral staircase that
leads to the second floor. You see three busts on

03:28:45.820 --> 03:28:52.524
each side of all these different elven, very
regal-looking figures adorning each side. You see

03:28:52.524 --> 03:28:56.133
around the side of it to the right, there appears
to be a dining hall with a long table.

03:28:56.133 --> 03:28:57.933
(metal hitting the table)

03:28:57.963 --> 03:28:59.133
SAM: Sorry.

03:28:59.133 --> 03:29:05.562
MATT: There you go. To the left it, looks like a kitchen vicinity,
and there's the spiral staircase that leads up.

03:29:05.709 --> 03:29:07.406
TRAVIS: We should go up.

03:29:07.406 --> 03:29:11.106
LAURA: There were a lot of traps in the last house
we were in.

03:29:11.106 --> 03:29:18.558
MATT: Outside of the wall where you guys are,
Ulog's like, "My turn. Give me a lift?"

03:29:18.558 --> 03:29:21.214
MARISHA: Fuck. God, are you sure, Ulog?

03:29:21.214 --> 03:29:22.607
LIAM: You're going up?

03:29:22.607 --> 03:29:25.117
MATT: "Are we not going in?"

03:29:25.117 --> 03:29:30.944
LIAM: I'm going in with her. Kneel down. I'm going
to climb up on his back and start to try to climb.

03:29:31.265 --> 03:29:32.797
MATT: Make an athletics check.

03:29:32.797 --> 03:29:35.031
LAURA: Why? Why are we adding more things to
this?

03:29:35.031 --> 03:29:37.156
MARISHA: You at least need a rogue. All you need
is the rogue.

03:29:37.156 --> 03:29:38.624
TRAVIS: Don't have to do it all.

03:29:38.624 --> 03:29:39.679
LIAM: 17.

03:29:39.679 --> 03:29:44.216
MATT: 17. You climb up over the wall and get to
the very top. He puts his hands up. "Help me."

03:29:44.216 --> 03:29:51.102
MARISHA: Ulog. No, Ulog, why don't we stay? They
can plan it. Let's just fucking stay.

03:29:51.102 --> 03:29:55.512
MATT: "Because I helped put this together. I want
to be here. I want to make sure this happens."

03:29:55.512 --> 03:30:01.937
MARISHA: Ulog, listen to me. You are here. You are
a part of it, just let them do this. Trust us.

03:30:01.937 --> 03:30:06.223
MATT: "Understand, she might have paperwork up
there that could absolve my wife."

03:30:06.223 --> 03:30:10.347
MARISHA: Ulog, this is not the point of why we're
here in the moment. Stay focused. We can get your

03:30:10.347 --> 03:30:17.004
wife out later. Don't blow the whole operation
because of your wife.

03:30:17.004 --> 03:30:18.277
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:30:18.277 --> 03:30:19.962
MARISHA: Fuck.

03:30:19.962 --> 03:30:22.474
SAM: Beau's got all the persuasion.

03:30:22.474 --> 03:30:25.416
MARISHA: Yeah, it's not my thing, you guys.

03:30:26.935 --> 03:30:28.434
Four total.

03:30:28.434 --> 03:30:34.439
MATT: He gives you a nice, solid look and goes,
"Understood," and then leaps up onto the wall and

03:30:34.439 --> 03:30:37.188
off the other side, landing next to Nott.

03:30:37.188 --> 03:30:40.458
LIAM: Oh, he leaps? I was going to say, seeing
that argument, that I dropped down to the ground

03:30:40.458 --> 03:30:43.591
on the other side. And not help him.

03:30:43.591 --> 03:30:50.201
MATT: He glances up, sees you gone, and leaps. He
barely crests the top. He's a nimble dwarf.

03:30:50.201 --> 03:30:52.474
MARISHA: He could cost us everything.

03:30:52.474 --> 03:30:58.335
TALIESIN: Slightly ahead of the house, so I can
see if people are going to be approaching the

03:30:58.335 --> 03:31:03.175
house, I put my jacket down and set up a little
busking. A mild busk.

03:31:03.175 --> 03:31:08.259
TRAVIS: Jester, I know we have to move, and it's
not our thing, can we roughly check the stairwell

03:31:08.259 --> 03:31:09.563
for traps?

03:31:09.563 --> 03:31:10.751
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:31:10.751 --> 03:31:12.439
LAURA: Same, I'm looking around.

03:31:12.439 --> 03:31:13.698
MATT: Make it with advantage.

03:31:13.698 --> 03:31:15.663
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:31:15.791 --> 03:31:22.786
MATT: As you glance about the space, you can see
the statues that are facing each other on each

03:31:22.786 --> 03:31:34.875
side, it looks like the dust on the pedestal is
brushed off in an arc, like they are often rotated.

03:31:35.848 --> 03:31:42.350
TRAVIS: This is set up to-- wait a minute. If we
came home, there's got to be a way to turn it off,

03:31:42.350 --> 03:31:47.767
right? I mean, if she had walked in, she wouldn't
be trying to look out for the traps. Maybe there's

03:31:47.767 --> 03:31:51.757
something by the door jamb or in the wall, or
something we can press.

03:31:51.757 --> 03:31:59.327
LAURA: There was a little brick that turned off
all the magic things in the other place, so maybe

03:31:59.327 --> 03:32:03.087
can I look around on the walls and see if there's
some sort of--

03:32:03.087 --> 03:32:05.033
TRAVIS: Can we check the door jambs and the
walls?

03:32:05.099 --> 03:32:07.871
LAURA: To see if there's a trigger to stop all the
traps?

03:32:07.871 --> 03:32:15.442
MATT: Because you rolled a natural 20, you notice
that the dust that's grinding is from the sliding

03:32:15.442 --> 03:32:23.330
of the statues, and they all seem to slide towards
the stairs. If you look where the dust is on them,

03:32:23.330 --> 03:32:27.640
there's a slight outcropping on each of them and
the position appears like they have been moved

03:32:27.640 --> 03:32:32.782
many times away-- they're facing each other-- to
look toward the stairs.

03:32:32.782 --> 03:32:34.884
LAURA: Let's turn them. We turn them together.

03:32:34.884 --> 03:32:36.407
TRAVIS: The same time, one at each.

03:32:36.407 --> 03:32:38.338
TRAVIS and LAURA: One, two, three. (stone
grinding)

03:32:38.497 --> 03:32:43.539
MATT: As you do that, they both (stone grinding),
and you hear this (click) sound. The first two,

03:32:43.539 --> 03:32:47.313
they shift over towards that, matching the space
where the dust had shifted, and you hear a slight

03:32:47.313 --> 03:32:49.432
click or release sound.

03:32:49.432 --> 03:32:52.497
TRAVIS: Okay. We head up the stairs.

03:32:52.497 --> 03:32:56.344
LAURA: Yeah, sure. We start walking to look for
her room.

03:32:56.344 --> 03:33:00.952
MATT: There's three sets of these. So you do one
then the other.

03:33:00.952 --> 03:33:03.401
TRAVIS: Each one. One, two, three, one two three.

03:33:03.401 --> 03:33:06.750
MATT: You do it together, all three of them shift,
and with each one you hear a click and release.

03:33:06.750 --> 03:33:10.399
You guys are in the backyard. Are you doing
anything?

03:33:10.399 --> 03:33:13.250
SAM: I'm going to try to open the back door.

03:33:13.250 --> 03:33:15.064
MATT: The three of you are back there with the
lock.

03:33:15.064 --> 03:33:16.163
LIAM: I cast Detect Magic.

03:33:16.163 --> 03:33:19.759
MATT: The back door is locked. Make an
investigation check, if you'd like.

03:33:19.759 --> 03:33:22.835
SAM and MATT: Natural 20.

03:33:22.835 --> 03:33:24.936
MARISHA: It's coming back around!

03:33:24.936 --> 03:33:28.624
MATT: I know, look at this! The back door is
locked, it is not trapped.

03:33:28.624 --> 03:33:30.068
SAM: Okay, I will unlock it.

03:33:31.369 --> 03:33:33.656
Not so good. Nine.

03:33:33.656 --> 03:33:40.714
MATT: You go and get the tools in there and it
gets stuck.

03:33:40.714 --> 03:33:43.337
SAM: Ulog! Ulog, I need your help.

03:33:43.337 --> 03:33:48.726
MATT: "Oh, so now you need my help. Perfect."
Yeah, that'll do it. He goes ahead and takes them

03:33:48.726 --> 03:33:53.307
from you and then (click), gets it, pulls them out
gently, hands them back to you.

03:33:53.307 --> 03:33:54.981
SAM: Does he come around the back of me?

03:33:54.981 --> 03:34:05.417
MATT: Like Ghost-style? He does so, but he does so
begrudgingly. He's like (grumbles). He pulls away

03:34:05.417 --> 03:34:09.382
and quickly gets it, and hands them back to you.
"Here you go."

03:34:09.382 --> 03:34:11.441
SAM: The pleasure was all mine.

03:34:11.441 --> 03:34:15.614
MATT: "Ugh." Opens the door, you guys hear the
slight creaking of a doorway down in the second

03:34:15.614 --> 03:34:17.117
floor as you're ascending the stairs.

03:34:17.117 --> 03:34:20.572
LIAM: I grab both of her shoulders and peer in to
see if anything glows.

03:34:20.572 --> 03:34:24.711
MATT: You glance inside. It does not appear
anything in the vicinity-- It's a dining room. You

03:34:24.711 --> 03:34:30.454
can see the opposite side of a long table with
chairs. Make a perception check.

03:34:30.454 --> 03:34:32.594
SAM: At a time like this?

03:34:32.594 --> 03:34:35.102
TRAVIS: Our front door creaked open when we came
in?

03:34:35.102 --> 03:34:38.042
MATT: No, you heard a door down below. You heard
them enter from elsewhere in the building, but you

03:34:38.042 --> 03:34:39.357
just heard a (creak).

03:34:39.507 --> 03:34:44.873
MARISHA: Do I still see Frumpkin on the wall?

03:34:44.873 --> 03:34:45.873
MATT: What?

03:34:45.873 --> 03:34:47.873
MARISHA: Do I still see Frumpkin on the wall?

03:34:47.873 --> 03:34:48.778
MATT: Yes.

03:34:48.816 --> 03:34:55.800
MARISHA: I'm going to try and get Frumpkin's
attention. "Tell Caleb to watch out for Ulog."

03:34:55.800 --> 03:35:01.149
MATT: (meows) Jumps down into the back and goes
and catches up to you. You glance inside. Nothing

03:35:01.149 --> 03:35:04.302
magical catches your attention in the chamber.

03:35:04.302 --> 03:35:08.885
MARISHA: Can Beau be casing and be full-on stealth
mode watching for anything?

03:35:08.885 --> 03:35:13.928
MATT: Yes. Make a stealth check? You, as you begin
to set up busking, one of the other guards

03:35:13.928 --> 03:35:17.870
wandering by comes by, kicks your cards a bit, and
goes, "Hey, hey! Move along. No street busking,

03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:19.653
too late. Gala's on."

03:35:19.653 --> 03:35:21.968
TALIESIN: Oh, no, I'm on break. One on the house?

03:35:21.968 --> 03:35:24.215
MATT: "I said piss off. Keep moving."

03:35:24.215 --> 03:35:28.115
TALIESIN: I'm going to very slowly put my stuff
together and fold it all up.

03:35:28.115 --> 03:35:31.192
MATT: He sits there and watches you do it.

03:35:31.192 --> 03:35:34.629
TALIESIN: Move around, yeah, but as long as I have
an eye on the main thoroughfare.

03:35:34.629 --> 03:35:36.817
MATT: Okay. What did you roll for stealth?

03:35:36.817 --> 03:35:40.042
MARISHA: Ten. I'm going to flip my coat to the
brown side.

03:35:40.042 --> 03:35:46.857
MATT: You walk around, as you're casing the joint,
as you're watching, you keep an eye on the two

03:35:46.857 --> 03:35:51.071
guards to the front. The two guards are looking
out, and one of them makes eye contact with you,

03:35:51.071 --> 03:35:55.537
and as you walk, he watches you walk, and you
realize that moment that you've been noticed.

03:35:55.537 --> 03:35:56.783
MARISHA: I keep walking.

03:35:56.783 --> 03:35:58.231
MATT: You're being watched from a distance.

03:35:58.231 --> 03:35:59.327
LAURA: You've been made!

03:35:59.327 --> 03:36:02.389
MARISHA: I keep walking and I look casual. Do I
see any crowded areas?

03:36:04.315 --> 03:36:08.447
MATT: No, most everybody's at the gala right now.
You can see in the distance, you can see the

03:36:08.447 --> 03:36:14.428
party's still going on. The music's still playing
from the distance. There's still drinking and

03:36:14.428 --> 03:36:20.316
revelry muffled in the distance, the din of the
crowd giving this low (distant cheering).

03:36:20.316 --> 03:36:24.089
MARISHA: If I get a chance, I want to try and lose
him.

03:36:24.089 --> 03:36:28.722
MATT: He's not following you. He's just watching
you as you walk. So you're going to try and move

03:36:28.722 --> 03:36:30.157
out of his eyesight?

03:36:30.157 --> 03:36:32.509
MARISHA: I'm going to try and move around, yeah,
and move out of his eyesight.

03:36:32.509 --> 03:36:33.917
MATT: You move out of his eyesight.

03:36:33.917 --> 03:36:35.604
MARISHA: Anything? Do I notice any following me?

03:36:35.604 --> 03:36:37.280
MATT: Perception check.

03:36:38.867 --> 03:36:39.950
MARISHA: Balls.

03:36:41.171 --> 03:36:42.656
TRAVIS: Not today.

03:36:42.656 --> 03:36:44.516
MARISHA: Ten again.

03:36:44.516 --> 03:36:48.969
MATT: Nothing seems to catch your eye, no one
following you. You guys, you heard the creak from

03:36:48.969 --> 03:36:51.126
downstairs. What are you doing?

03:36:51.126 --> 03:36:53.703
LAURA: What's that? Do you think somebody just got
home?

03:36:53.703 --> 03:36:55.787
TRAVIS: We've got to keep going. We can't stop
now.

03:36:55.787 --> 03:36:59.812
LAURA: Okay. We keep looking for traps up on the
top floor and looking for a bedroom.

03:36:59.812 --> 03:37:01.907
MATT: You head to the top floor. Investigation
check, both of you. You guys, what are you doing?

03:37:01.907 --> 03:37:04.461
LIAM: What do we see? What do we see where we
are?

03:37:04.461 --> 03:37:07.251
MATT: There's a long dining room table with chairs
set up.

03:37:07.754 --> 03:37:09.328
LIAM: Doors out of here?

03:37:09.328 --> 03:37:11.268
MATT: It leads out into a foyer area.

03:37:11.268 --> 03:37:13.181
TRAVIS: 19 investigation.

03:37:13.181 --> 03:37:14.725
LAURA: Nice, 15 for me.

03:37:14.725 --> 03:37:20.877
MATT: You get to the second floor. There's a small
landing and a singular door. The door does not

03:37:20.877 --> 03:37:23.281
appear to be locked or trapped.

03:37:24.531 --> 03:37:26.389
SAM: Want to send Frumpkin in?

03:37:26.411 --> 03:37:30.899
LIAM: No. We move forward. You ten feet in front
of me. I will look for magic, you will look for

03:37:30.899 --> 03:37:33.025
physical obstacles. Here we go.

03:37:33.025 --> 03:37:35.387
SAM: Great. Let's go. (chanting) Checking for
traps.

03:37:35.387 --> 03:37:37.264
LIAM: (chanting) Checking for magic.

03:37:37.264 --> 03:37:39.538
MARISHA: Checking for traps, checking for traps.

03:37:39.538 --> 03:37:45.695
MATT: As you guys head through the dining area
into the main foyer, you see there is the hallway

03:37:45.695 --> 03:37:50.836
that leads into the kitchen, the staircase that
spirals upward, and these statues that are all

03:37:50.836 --> 03:37:56.497
facing towards the stairs. The statues give off a
magical glow, and you hear the sound of a (creak)

03:37:56.497 --> 03:38:02.181
upstairs, a door slowly creaking open. As you guys
look into the chamber, as the door swings open,

03:38:02.181 --> 03:38:07.566
you see a darkened bedroom, equally gaudy as the
rest of the house. You can see along the walls

03:38:07.566 --> 03:38:14.916
there are portraits of men, human, different ages,
that are all lining it.

03:38:16.074 --> 03:38:17.748
SAM: It's One Direction.

03:38:17.748 --> 03:38:19.396
LIAM: No!

03:38:19.396 --> 03:38:25.694
MATT: You can there's a small chamber, an archway
that leads into a washroom. You can see an ivory

03:38:25.694 --> 03:38:29.535
basin that's barely visible from the little bit
the moonlight that's coming through, a gable

03:38:29.535 --> 03:38:32.065
window on the opposite side of the chamber.

03:38:32.065 --> 03:38:34.265
LAURA: What's a gable window?

03:38:34.265 --> 03:38:39.287
SAM: I think you have one at your house. In your
kitchen?

03:38:39.287 --> 03:38:40.749
LAURA: Okay.

03:38:40.893 --> 03:38:45.982
MATT: It protrudes a bit, arcs, then ends there.
In the center of where that gable window is,

03:38:45.982 --> 03:38:46.935
there's--

03:38:49.795 --> 03:38:51.068
LIAM: A kraken.

03:38:52.091 --> 03:38:57.589
MATT: A roller desk. The front has been rolled
shut. There's a door on each side of the gable

03:38:57.589 --> 03:39:01.349
window that leads to the balcony that you saw
before, that looks over everything. It's a giant

03:39:01.349 --> 03:39:06.527
glass window that looks out over the city. It has
a beautiful view of the Tri-Spires and the gala in

03:39:06.527 --> 03:39:09.880
the distance. You can see the light emanating over
the dark night sky.

03:39:09.880 --> 03:39:11.378
LAURA: This might be a good place to leave the
letter.

03:39:11.378 --> 03:39:12.712
LIAM: Can you message the others?

03:39:12.712 --> 03:39:20.217
MATT: There is a large bed, and floor itself is
covered in tiger and animal skins as a means of

03:39:20.217 --> 03:39:32.732
decor in the space. The walls themselves are a
faint gray-blue velvet texture. It's terrible.

03:39:32.732 --> 03:39:36.358
That's what you have in front of you.

03:39:36.358 --> 03:39:37.704
LAURA: Should we look for traps in here?

03:39:37.704 --> 03:39:38.744
TRAVIS: Yeah, one more time.

03:39:38.744 --> 03:39:40.288
LAURA: One more time, we're looking for more
traps.

03:39:40.288 --> 03:39:42.336
TRAVIS: Anything that's an obvious trap in the
bedroom.

03:39:42.336 --> 03:39:43.707
LIAM: We're moving through the foyer.

03:39:43.707 --> 03:39:49.405
SAM: I cast Message upstairs blindly, not knowing
where they are, saying: we're in the house, we're

03:39:49.405 --> 03:39:53.339
coming up to help you. You can, of course, reply
to this message.

03:39:53.339 --> 03:39:55.130
MARISHA: Oh my god, you're on fire!

03:39:55.130 --> 03:39:56.686
TRAVIS: 23 investigation.

03:39:56.686 --> 03:40:01.095
LAURA: Nice. I rolled a 12 investigation. I
respond, and I say: We're upstairs in her bedroom

03:40:01.095 --> 03:40:02.830
or office or something.

03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:06.293
SAM: They're upstairs! Let's go! Ulog, they're not
upstairs.

03:40:08.473 --> 03:40:13.850
MATT: "Right." You guys all head up the stairs
together as a group. Perception check on both your

03:40:13.935 --> 03:40:15.117
guys' points.

03:40:15.117 --> 03:40:16.449
SAM: Oh, shit.

03:40:16.849 --> 03:40:17.770
LIAM: Girl!

03:40:17.770 --> 03:40:18.751
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:40:18.751 --> 03:40:19.855
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:40:19.855 --> 03:40:20.738
TALIESIN: Seven.

03:40:20.853 --> 03:40:22.639
MARISHA: Oh, did you <i>see</i> it?!

03:40:22.639 --> 03:40:24.353
LAURA: Oh god, these lookouts!

03:40:24.353 --> 03:40:27.758
SAM: Everyone <i>thinks</i> that Matt is managing three
storylines right now, but there's actually a

03:40:27.758 --> 03:40:30.915
fourth that we don't even know about.

03:40:30.915 --> 03:40:32.052
MARISHA: Five.

03:40:32.052 --> 03:40:33.132
MATT: Five.

03:40:33.132 --> 03:40:34.336
TALIESIN: Seven.

03:40:34.336 --> 03:40:37.097
MATT: Okay. You guys keep an eye out in the
vicinity. Nothing seems to pique your interest.

03:40:37.097 --> 03:40:39.769
MARISHA: I switch my robe.

03:40:39.769 --> 03:40:44.274
MATT: Again? Okay. Good to know. All right. You
guys check around. There are no traps in the

03:40:44.274 --> 03:40:49.073
vicinity. You do, as you approach the roller desk,
it is locked. There is like an actual keyhole and

03:40:49.073 --> 03:40:51.737
there is something that is meant to unlock the
desk.

03:40:51.737 --> 03:40:53.946
TRAVIS: Fuck. There's a key.

03:40:53.946 --> 03:40:56.183
LIAM: Nott and Caleb are still going up the
stairs.

03:40:56.183 --> 03:41:00.267
MATT: Yeah. And Ulog-- you guys all come up to the
landing and you can see the door inside. Nothing

03:41:00.267 --> 03:41:04.190
magical in the vicinity other than what you guys
have on yourselves.

03:41:04.190 --> 03:41:07.440
LAURA: I feel along the edge under her mattress
and see if I can feel any keys.

03:41:07.440 --> 03:41:09.958
TRAVIS: Can I reach underneath the desk and behind
it? Underneath it.

03:41:09.958 --> 03:41:11.287
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

03:41:11.287 --> 03:41:12.505
SAM: Yeah, <i>grope</i> that desk.

03:41:12.505 --> 03:41:13.686
LAURA: Anything she's like stuck--

03:41:13.686 --> 03:41:14.810
TRAVIS: 17.

03:41:14.810 --> 03:41:16.112
SAM: Yes, look at you!

03:41:16.112 --> 03:41:21.071
MATT: Reaching around the desk, there's no tricks,
no trips, no buttons or anything. You're looking

03:41:21.071 --> 03:41:22.463
through the bed?

03:41:22.463 --> 03:41:25.915
LAURA: I'm reaching under her mattress and seeing
if she's stuck anything between.

03:41:25.915 --> 03:41:27.227
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:41:29.767 --> 03:41:31.195
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:41:31.195 --> 03:41:33.694
(cheering)

03:41:33.694 --> 03:41:36.251
TALIESIN: You know what kind of fold she uses in
her undersheet. It's like that.

03:41:36.251 --> 03:41:48.134
MATT: Nice. Reaching underneath, you find a hard
object, a binding, and you pull-- it's a book. You

03:41:48.134 --> 03:41:51.557
slowly pull it out and take a look at it.

03:41:51.557 --> 03:41:53.084
SAM: (whispers) Tusk Love!

03:41:53.084 --> 03:41:54.537
LAURA: (laughs) Volume one.

03:41:54.537 --> 03:42:01.784
MATT: No. It's a familiar leather tome that was an
illegal story that was previously presented to you

03:42:01.784 --> 03:42:11.247
in a smut bookstore that had been hidden in the
cushions of the bed. It has a place marker about

03:42:11.247 --> 03:42:13.228
two thirds of the way through.

03:42:13.228 --> 03:42:16.402
LAURA: Oh, she's naughty.

03:42:16.402 --> 03:42:21.161
MATT: Ulog at this point is looking about the room
as well. He rushes over to the desk where you are

03:42:21.161 --> 03:42:25.697
and he goes, "Don't worry, I got this." He's going
to go ahead and attempt to pick the lock on that.

03:42:25.697 --> 03:42:27.732
LIAM: Have the vagrants caught up yet?

03:42:27.732 --> 03:42:29.529
MATT: Yeah, you guys have all caught up. You're in
the room now.

03:42:29.529 --> 03:42:31.634
LIAM: Detect Magic wipe in this room.

03:42:31.634 --> 03:42:40.167
MATT: As you glance through, there is a faint
magical essence that begins to appear from the

03:42:40.167 --> 03:42:50.030
desk as Ulog (click) opens it. It slides open and
you see a faint glow from a small case about that

03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:51.979
large sitting on the desk.

03:42:51.979 --> 03:42:54.278
LIAM: Leave that box, that case, that box, be
careful.

03:42:54.278 --> 03:42:55.975
MATT: "That's fine." He starts--

03:42:55.975 --> 03:42:57.391
LIAM: No, it's not fine!

03:42:57.391 --> 03:42:58.550
MATT: No, he's going through paperwork.

03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:59.360
SAM: Oh.

03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:01.068
MATT: He's grabbing books and he's starting to
thumb through--

03:43:01.068 --> 03:43:02.879
TRAVIS: The priority is the letter. Let's start
getting that paperwork.

03:43:02.879 --> 03:43:06.805
LAURA: I run over with the letter and can we put
it in her desk to hide it? The sealed letter.

03:43:06.805 --> 03:43:08.598
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and place the letter in
there.

03:43:08.598 --> 03:43:10.085
SAM: Should I open the little box again?

03:43:10.085 --> 03:43:11.536
LAURA: Oh, is there a fireplace?

03:43:11.536 --> 03:43:13.138
MATT: There is no fireplace in this room.

03:43:13.138 --> 03:43:14.276
SAM: Schmidt!

03:43:14.276 --> 03:43:16.046
TRAVIS: Aren't we supposed to toss the room,
aren't we supposed to make it-- no, we're coming

03:43:16.046 --> 03:43:17.000
in and out, so--

03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:18.429
LAURA: Is there a wastebasket?

03:43:18.429 --> 03:43:24.730
MATT: You don't see a wastebasket necessarily, no.
There's a small, almost like a pot of some kind

03:43:24.730 --> 03:43:27.640
that is set next to the desk that looks like it
might be used as a receptacle occasionally.

03:43:27.640 --> 03:43:29.705
MARISHA: Oh yeah, like a bedside pot.

03:43:29.705 --> 03:43:32.265
LIAM: What is the type of magic emanating from the
case?

03:43:32.265 --> 03:43:35.464
MATT: That would be evocation.

03:43:35.464 --> 03:43:39.851
LIAM: Evo-- (gasp) that's bad.

03:43:39.851 --> 03:43:43.553
TRAVIS: Let's leave it alone. Let's get the
letters in and the seals. Let's place it all.

03:43:43.553 --> 03:43:46.671
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

03:43:54.291 --> 03:43:55.672
SAM: Suspense!

03:43:56.047 --> 03:43:57.040
LIAM: 18.

03:43:57.040 --> 03:44:02.865
MATT: 18. While the shape is not familiar to you,
the size and the length of it, you've seen these

03:44:02.865 --> 03:44:09.978
type of cases before. They're usually used to
contain important rolled pieces of parchment,

03:44:09.978 --> 03:44:13.104
specifically those that need to be protected from
the elements because they contain enchantments on

03:44:13.104 --> 03:44:15.217
them. This is a scroll case.

03:44:15.217 --> 03:44:18.024
SAM: Ooh! (taps feet rapidly) Take it! Take it!

03:44:18.024 --> 03:44:19.859
MARISHA: No trace. Leave no trace!

03:44:19.859 --> 03:44:21.097
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

03:44:21.097 --> 03:44:22.319
MARISHA: God no, god!

03:44:22.319 --> 03:44:23.938
MATT: Ulog is going through papers frantically and
like searching through. He's going to make an

03:44:23.938 --> 03:44:25.022
investigation check.

03:44:25.022 --> 03:44:26.960
MARISHA: No, don't fucking compromise everything!

03:44:26.960 --> 03:44:28.965
LAURA: Caleb, I swear to fucking gods.

03:44:28.965 --> 03:44:30.872
TRAVIS: Come on, the letters.

03:44:30.872 --> 03:44:38.274
LAURA: Okay, I'll take the-- oh! I'm going to take
the torn piece and hide it under her bed. Then I

03:44:38.274 --> 03:44:42.676
have the letter left, the Knights of Requital
letter. Where should I put this?

03:44:42.676 --> 03:44:45.775
TRAVIS: I mean, right on the desk, right? We
should put it right there.

03:44:45.775 --> 03:44:50.100
LAURA: On the desk as well? No, we should scatter
it around so that if certain things don't get

03:44:50.100 --> 03:44:56.312
found-- is there any other good place like, in her
bedside tables or anything like that?

03:44:56.312 --> 03:45:01.246
MATT: There looks like a space there, it's a
table, it doesn't have a drawer or anything, it's

03:45:01.246 --> 03:45:03.135
just a table you can hide something on or put
something underneath.

03:45:03.135 --> 03:45:06.102
LAURA: Is there clutter on the desk at all, or
decorations and stuff?

03:45:06.102 --> 03:45:11.049
MATT: A faint bit; there's like a candle and a
small piece of clockwork.

03:45:11.049 --> 03:45:16.643
LAURA: I'll fold up the Knights of Requital letter
and hide it under her clock.

03:45:16.643 --> 03:45:18.866
MATT: Okay. At that point, Ulog goes--

03:45:18.866 --> 03:45:23.781
LAURA: Leave a little bit showing in the back, so
that someone could find if they're investigating.

03:45:23.781 --> 03:45:29.338
MATT: Right. There's another thing that you see
there. There is a small box that is wrapped in

03:45:29.338 --> 03:45:35.468
silver cord that is resting on the desk on top of
a stack of books.

03:45:35.468 --> 03:45:38.375
TRAVIS: We've seen those cords before. Do not
touch that!

03:45:38.375 --> 03:45:42.667
LIAM: Also, there is no other magic around this
room in the walls or anything, right?

03:45:42.667 --> 03:45:44.001
MATT: Not at the moment.

03:45:44.001 --> 03:45:45.341
LIAM: You've indicated everything that's here.

03:45:45.341 --> 03:45:46.521
MATT: Everything that you've seen, yes.

03:45:46.521 --> 03:45:48.099
LAURA: Are there any windows?

03:45:48.099 --> 03:45:50.794
MATT: There are giant gable windows. You have the
most beautiful view of the city.

03:45:50.794 --> 03:45:53.080
LAURA: Can we see anything out the window? Is
anybody coming, is--

03:45:53.080 --> 03:45:54.319
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:45:54.319 --> 03:45:56.054
LAURA: Does it look like the gala is ending?

03:45:56.054 --> 03:46:00.195
SAM: Do they open, or are they picture windows?
Wow.

03:46:00.195 --> 03:46:01.576
LAURA: Perception check?

03:46:01.576 --> 03:46:02.532
MATT: Yes.

03:46:02.532 --> 03:46:05.040
LAURA: 21.

03:46:05.040 --> 03:46:11.307
MATT: Okay. Well, first off, Ulog at this point is
going through and he goes, "I found it!" He's

03:46:11.307 --> 03:46:18.202
reading through and he's like frantically going
through the words. "That fucking bitch."

03:46:18.202 --> 03:46:19.785
SAM: What does it say?

03:46:19.785 --> 03:46:26.578
MATT: He starts reading out loud as you're
glancing over. He says, "These are the notes on

03:46:26.578 --> 03:46:32.553
Illiana's case. Saying that she wanted to show
that even the most unassuming dwarf can be a

03:46:32.553 --> 03:46:44.650
cutthroat. She admits that she was innocent, but
did it anyway just to set an example."

03:46:44.650 --> 03:46:47.275
LAURA: So we can show this as evidence.

03:46:47.275 --> 03:46:53.404
MATT: He takes it and folds it. "Oh yeah, we can."
He holds it in his hand. As you glance over to the

03:46:53.404 --> 03:47:00.245
side, you can see the front gate (creak) open.
Sorry, you see it close. (clink) You hear the

03:47:00.324 --> 03:47:05.284
sound. You guys hear this as well, though you were
trying to keep an eye over there, you totally

03:47:05.284 --> 03:47:10.677
found yourself spacing a bit and didn't notice
something shifting towards the door.

03:47:10.677 --> 03:47:15.498
TALIESIN: As I'm walking away from the house, I
start singing loudly, drunkenly (singing) I saw

03:47:15.498 --> 03:47:21.278
the moon in old, in the darkness.

03:47:21.278 --> 03:47:22.669
LAURA: Somebody just got home!

03:47:22.669 --> 03:47:24.092
TRAVIS: We got to get out of here. Let's go!

03:47:24.092 --> 03:47:28.790
TALIESIN: I'm going to sing loudly as I'm slowly
drunkenly making my way.

03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:30.436
MATT: Okay.

03:47:30.436 --> 03:47:32.730
TRAVIS: We laid the letters. Touch nothing! Let's
go!

03:47:32.730 --> 03:47:33.744
LAURA: Run, run!

03:47:33.744 --> 03:47:34.721
MATT: "Is it all set?"

03:47:34.721 --> 03:47:36.803
LAURA: Everything's set! Run! Out the back door!

03:47:36.803 --> 03:47:39.184
MATT: "Out the back door. All right." You guys all
heading outside?

03:47:39.184 --> 03:47:40.520
TRAVIS: I'm the last one to leave the room.

03:47:40.520 --> 03:47:41.189
LIAM: Yeah I grab the scroll case--

03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:42.430
MARISHA and TRAVIS: No!

03:47:42.430 --> 03:47:44.611
TRAVIS: I summon the falchion. I hold it right up
to his throat.

03:47:44.611 --> 03:47:46.112
LIAM: You have to detect that I did it.

03:47:46.112 --> 03:47:47.318
TRAVIS: Did you reach for it?

03:47:47.318 --> 03:47:48.285
LIAM: Of course I did.

03:47:48.285 --> 03:47:49.912
TRAVIS: I was the last one out of the room. Put it
back.

03:47:49.912 --> 03:47:50.681
MATT: Make a perception--

03:47:50.681 --> 03:47:51.727
LIAM: Are you in the room?

03:47:51.727 --> 03:47:53.033
TRAVIS: <i>Yes!</i> I was up here first!

03:47:53.033 --> 03:47:55.483
MATT: Hold on. Make a perception check. Make a
sleight of hand check. That's what this is for.

03:47:55.483 --> 03:47:57.036
TRAVIS: I said I was the last one in that room.

03:47:57.036 --> 03:47:57.908
MATT: You were.

03:47:57.908 --> 03:47:59.097
LIAM: Okay.

03:47:59.385 --> 03:48:00.533
TRAVIS: Fuck. 13.

03:48:00.533 --> 03:48:01.589
LIAM: Eight.

03:48:01.589 --> 03:48:02.692
MATT: Eight? You notice him go for it.

03:48:02.692 --> 03:48:04.703
TRAVIS: (whoosh) Leave no trace.

03:48:04.703 --> 03:48:06.071
LIAM: No, I'm taking this.

03:48:06.071 --> 03:48:07.048
TRAVIS: Put it back, or I'll--

03:48:07.048 --> 03:48:09.603
LIAM: I'm taking this. This isn't worth my time,
I'm taking this!

03:48:09.603 --> 03:48:11.916
TRAVIS: Put it down, or I'll leave you here--

03:48:11.916 --> 03:48:14.248
SAM: I pull out my hand crossbow and I point it at
Fjord.

03:48:14.300 --> 03:48:17.781
Fjord, put that fucking thing down!

03:48:17.931 --> 03:48:21.791
TRAVIS: (buzzing sound) My hand starts to glow
with Eldritch Blast energy. I will fucking leave

03:48:21.791 --> 03:48:27.067
both of you here. We're either a team, or you're
working for yourselves. Decide.

03:48:27.067 --> 03:48:30.013
MATT: You guys are all watching this from the
landing.

03:48:30.013 --> 03:48:31.539
LIAM: I walk out.

03:48:31.539 --> 03:48:33.210
LAURA: Somebody's coming.

03:48:33.210 --> 03:48:37.789
MATT: As you all slowly come to rest and look
back, and Caleb, as you walk out, you stop at the

03:48:37.789 --> 03:48:43.627
landing next to Ulog, and Beau-- oh sorry, you're
not there. You stop next to Ulog as, right there

03:48:43.627 --> 03:48:50.388
at the bottom of the stairs looking up, you see,
in a very beautiful, elegant, dark green dress,

03:48:50.388 --> 03:48:59.368
the High-Richter Prucine. "Hmm. My, my. I'm glad I
forgot my gift, or I would have missed you

03:48:59.368 --> 03:49:07.013
reprobates breaking and entering the home of a
High-Richter. I believe that carries a life

03:49:07.013 --> 03:49:14.450
sentence in the Umber Dungeon, wouldn't you say?
If I might ask, what <i>are</i> you looking for? You

03:49:14.450 --> 03:49:22.855
have my curiosity piqued." There's a brief pause,
as you're all glancing down. Ulog holds up the

03:49:22.855 --> 03:49:31.176
paper in his hand, and he goes, "You. You put my
wife in chains and you <i>know</i> she's innocent! We

03:49:31.176 --> 03:49:41.465
got proof now! It's over for you." She chuckles
and scoffs as she falls onto her back leg. "And

03:49:41.465 --> 03:49:47.415
how do you plan to deliver it? Curious. You think
my home won't be swarming with guards in a few

03:49:47.415 --> 03:49:52.890
minutes?" She pulls a brass bell out from under
her pouch and rings it outside--

03:49:52.890 --> 03:49:59.160
LAURA: No-- I was going to say I cast Guiding Bolt
at her, but--

03:49:59.160 --> 03:50:04.544
MATT: It's such a fast moment, if you didn't have
anything prepared, it happens too quickly. You're

03:50:04.608 --> 03:50:16.282
like "ah!" and the bell rings. "You, stump sucker.
I'll bleed over the extra years of your sentence

03:50:16.282 --> 03:50:24.008
into your wife's. That way you can both rot
together on opposite sides of the dungeon." Ulog

03:50:24.008 --> 03:50:29.358
looks at you all like, absolute fury and sadness
in his eyes. You see like tears down his cheek.

03:50:29.358 --> 03:50:31.635
LAURA: (whispers) Oh, I had it! Shitballs!

03:50:31.635 --> 03:50:33.446
TALIESIN: Hold Person?

03:50:33.446 --> 03:50:38.020
LAURA: Yeah, I had it prepared, and that's what I
wanted to cast. (fake sobs)

03:50:38.020 --> 03:50:46.337
MATT: He goes and takes the paper in his hand and
puts it in your arm, Caleb, making eye contact

03:50:46.337 --> 03:50:49.542
with you, and goes, "Promise me you'll see her
freed, friend."

03:50:49.542 --> 03:50:51.303
LAURA: I cast Hold Person on her!

03:50:51.303 --> 03:50:52.292
MATT: On her?

03:50:52.292 --> 03:50:53.529
LAURA: I'm just going to do it.

03:50:53.529 --> 03:50:54.817
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it anyway!

03:50:54.817 --> 03:51:02.266
MATT: All righty. Natural 20. She resists it. She
goes, "What are you trying--" and Ulog goes,

03:51:02.266 --> 03:51:09.636
(roars) grabs towards his neck and runs, leaps off
the stairs towards her and attempts to tackle her.

03:51:09.723 --> 03:51:11.487
LAURA: We should take off while he does it.

03:51:11.487 --> 03:51:16.453
MATT: You watch-- yeah. He goes and (boof)! She
falls onto the ground and onto the landing of the

03:51:16.453 --> 03:51:21.382
spiral staircase. They both slide a moment. You
watch as she goes, "What are you--" and he grabs

03:51:21.382 --> 03:51:27.578
and pulls that orange-ish bead that he had on his
necklace and slams it into her mouth and holds it

03:51:27.578 --> 03:51:30.540
over. There's a moment of tension before--

03:51:31.890 --> 03:51:35.548
(explosion) A flash of white, fiery, burning

03:51:35.548 --> 03:51:42.901
light explodes, a fireball sundering the interior
of the staircase. You all have your ears ringing.

03:51:42.901 --> 03:51:46.324
The pain's there. The ones that are closest by
would have been you, Caleb; I need you to roll a

03:51:46.324 --> 03:51:48.491
dexterity saving throw, please.

03:51:48.491 --> 03:51:49.669
SAM: (whispers) It was a suicide!

03:51:49.669 --> 03:51:50.719
LIAM: Seven.

03:51:50.719 --> 03:51:52.215
MATT: That's a failure.

03:51:52.215 --> 03:51:54.388
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:51:58.247 --> 03:52:05.388
MATT: Thankfully a shitty roll for you. That is 21
points of fire damage.

03:52:05.388 --> 03:52:06.882
LIAM: Unconscious.

03:52:06.882 --> 03:52:11.967
MATT: Caleb goes unconscious onto the ground. As
you guys all come to in the moment, you look down

03:52:11.967 --> 03:52:17.690
at the middle of the staircase: the walls are
blackened, the staircase is currently in the

03:52:17.690 --> 03:52:25.735
process of burning, and down, you see the twisted,
gnarled corpses of both Ulog and the High-Richter Prucine.

03:52:25.854 --> 03:52:27.136
LAURA: (gasps) We have to get out of here!

03:52:27.136 --> 03:52:27.995
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to go.

03:52:27.995 --> 03:52:29.210
MATT: You hear (boom).

03:52:29.210 --> 03:52:31.245
TRAVIS: Jester, help me! We start backing up,
yeah.

03:52:31.245 --> 03:52:33.380
LAURA: I run down, I grab Caleb, and we run out
the back door.

03:52:33.380 --> 03:52:36.453
MATT: As you head down the stairway, you can see
the front door being hit from the opposite side.

03:52:36.453 --> 03:52:38.254
MARISHA: What do me and Molly see?

03:52:38.254 --> 03:52:43.307
MATT: You guys watch this flash of light. The
glass windows shatter outward from the balcony.

03:52:43.307 --> 03:52:47.602
The two guards at the bottom go, "Uh!" They
quickly throw open the gate and are now currently

03:52:47.602 --> 03:52:49.952
slamming themselves trying to barricade into the
door.

03:52:49.952 --> 03:52:51.382
MARISHA: To the back!

03:52:51.382 --> 03:52:54.068
TALIESIN: Yeah. We're going to start flanking to
the back.

03:52:54.068 --> 03:52:56.187
MATT: Okay. As you guys are rushing, make a
perception check.

03:52:56.187 --> 03:52:57.864
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:52:59.760 --> 03:53:00.923
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:53:00.923 --> 03:53:01.979
MARISHA: 19.

03:53:01.979 --> 03:53:03.119
TALIESIN and LAURA: Finally.

03:53:03.119 --> 03:53:07.384
MATT: Okay. As you guys are rushing, you suddenly
hear this very loud, high-pitched whine sound.

03:53:07.384 --> 03:53:13.802
You're like (pained sound). It causes your head
to-- and you, especially glance over as you begin

03:53:13.802 --> 03:53:18.782
to surmise the direction, you look past and you
can see the Tri-Spires there. In the direction,

03:53:18.782 --> 03:53:23.946
you see the mighty Zauber Spire, of the Halls of
Erudition there in the distance, and you see there

03:53:23.946 --> 03:53:29.705
this growing, black, spherical mass beginning to
emerge from the side of the lower third of the

03:53:29.705 --> 03:53:33.057
tower. You watch as it expands, the whining gets
louder and louder.

03:53:33.057 --> 03:53:35.760
TALIESIN: I'm going to take cover.

03:53:35.760 --> 03:53:41.014
MATT: You hear this crack sound as the black
sphere suddenly folds into nothing, and where it

03:53:41.014 --> 03:53:46.772
was, you see all the stone that made that part of
the tower collapse, crush, and then stumble. The

03:53:46.772 --> 03:53:54.520
tower begins to slowly shift, as you hear in the
distance screams echoing around. The music stops.

03:53:54.520 --> 03:54:00.068
The attention of the guards suddenly shift over
from the banging door to the tower crumbling. You

03:54:00.068 --> 03:54:04.683
watch as the tower-- suddenly there's a flash of
blue light, and the tower stops. You see a brief

03:54:04.683 --> 03:54:09.613
shift of a force field on the bottom that holds it
in place, partially collapsed. You see two figures

03:54:09.613 --> 03:54:12.024
take off from the top.

03:54:12.024 --> 03:54:13.258
SAM: What is going on?!

03:54:13.258 --> 03:54:14.698
MARISHA: What are the figures?!

03:54:14.698 --> 03:54:21.060
MATT: You see two other figures leap out of the
hole from where the explosion, weird black sphere

03:54:21.060 --> 03:54:26.083
was at the base of it, and leap down about 35-40
feet, below the tree line. You see the two figures

03:54:26.083 --> 03:54:30.989
begin coasting, flying through the air in the
direction where they were, as bolts of energy

03:54:30.989 --> 03:54:36.713
start arcing out of their hands towards where
those two other figures fell. The screams are

03:54:36.713 --> 03:54:39.672
getting louder now and you can see now the guards
are starting to rush out of the various street

03:54:39.672 --> 03:54:44.261
corners. You guys are rushing around-- you were
rushing towards the back, and then slowed as this

03:54:44.261 --> 03:54:50.647
started happening. It's distracting you. You guys
start hearing this cacophony outside as you rush

03:54:50.647 --> 03:54:53.652
through the back door. You get to the back wall.
What are you doing?

03:54:53.652 --> 03:54:55.567
MARISHA: There's something bigger going on other
than us.

03:54:55.567 --> 03:54:56.877
TALIESIN: We've got to get out of here.

03:54:56.877 --> 03:54:58.269
TRAVIS: Caleb's unconscious; we've got to get him
out.

03:54:58.269 --> 03:55:00.017
MARISHA: I try and--

03:55:00.017 --> 03:55:01.752
LAURA: I don't have any spells left!

03:55:01.752 --> 03:55:04.384
TRAVIS: I have a healing potion, I'll put it in
Caleb's mouth.

03:55:04.384 --> 03:55:07.080
MARISHA: I try and get that back door open and try
and get them out.

03:55:07.080 --> 03:55:10.001
MATT: You get that door open, you guys start
rushing out there, you heal up Caleb. You come to

03:55:10.001 --> 03:55:12.252
consciousness being dragged, your feet grinding.

03:55:12.252 --> 03:55:15.412
LIAM: I was doing death saves and it was not going
well. Just for shits and giggles!

03:55:15.412 --> 03:55:18.357
(laughter)

03:55:18.897 --> 03:55:24.181
SAM: Alone upstairs, I pick up the scrolls and put
them in my pocket.

03:55:24.181 --> 03:55:27.949
MARISHA: I mean, the house is on fire now. God
damn.

03:55:27.949 --> 03:55:30.153
SAM: I'm going to open the gable windows, if they
open, and jump out them.

03:55:30.153 --> 03:55:31.611
MATT: Well, the windows are shattered, the
explosion--

03:55:31.611 --> 03:55:34.404
SAM: I jump out the windows and scatter as far as
I can.

03:55:34.404 --> 03:55:36.793
MATT: Make an acrobatics check followed by a
stealth check.

03:55:36.793 --> 03:55:38.022
MARISHA: Holy shit.

03:55:38.022 --> 03:55:43.626
SAM: Ooh, acrobatics, not great. Ten. Stealth,
16.

03:55:43.626 --> 03:55:46.995
MATT: Well, you reduce the damage you take by one
die, so you only take two points of bludgeoning

03:55:46.995 --> 03:55:50.925
damage. As you land, your ankle twists, and you
tumble and roll and get up. What's your stealth

03:55:50.925 --> 03:55:51.764
check?

03:55:51.764 --> 03:55:52.994
SAM: 16.

03:55:52.994 --> 03:55:57.019
MATT: Using the chaos that way and the guards that
are now out in the middle of the street, you land

03:55:57.019 --> 03:56:00.400
behind them. One of them goes to turn in your
direction, and you dart behind the wall, leap over

03:56:00.400 --> 03:56:04.184
the side and arc around to meet the rest of the
party, as you all slowly begin to climb over the

03:56:04.184 --> 03:56:08.089
back wall, where Beau and Molly are waiting for
you.

03:56:08.320 --> 03:56:09.982
TALIESIN: We've got to get out of here.

03:56:09.982 --> 03:56:10.785
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:56:10.785 --> 03:56:12.073
LAURA: That went so bad!

03:56:12.073 --> 03:56:13.711
MARISHA: I think we were a bigger distraction.

03:56:13.711 --> 03:56:15.097
SAM: What's going on?

03:56:15.097 --> 03:56:16.317
MARISHA: I think there's something else going.

03:56:16.317 --> 03:56:17.141
SAM: Did we do this?!

03:56:17.141 --> 03:56:18.110
MARISHA: No, we didn't!

03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:19.587
SAM: It's Molly, isn't it? Molly did it!

03:56:19.587 --> 03:56:21.587
LAURA: We’re running to the sewers!

03:56:21.587 --> 03:56:24.167
MATT: Running to the sewers? Everyone make a
stealth check as you're trying to make your way

03:56:24.167 --> 03:56:27.418
through there. People are now starting to run back
to their homes, you can see people running and

03:56:27.418 --> 03:56:33.123
screaming now, dressed in full attire for the
gala, leaving their masks behind, screaming bloody murder.

03:56:33.123 --> 03:56:33.886
TRAVIS: 15.

03:56:33.886 --> 03:56:34.636
LAURA: Five.

03:56:34.636 --> 03:56:35.441
MARISHA: 12.

03:56:35.441 --> 03:56:36.336
LIAM: Five.

03:56:36.336 --> 03:56:36.981
SAM: 19.

03:56:36.981 --> 03:56:38.002
TALIESIN: 14.

03:56:38.002 --> 03:56:39.048
MATT: Okay.

03:56:39.048 --> 03:56:40.011
LIAM: Give it to me!

03:56:40.011 --> 03:56:41.147
TRAVIS: Bunch of teens and a five!

03:56:41.147 --> 03:56:43.766
MATT: I know, that's okay. So a couple of bad
rolls, but for the most part, you guys averaged

03:56:43.766 --> 03:56:46.059
okay. Thankfully with the chaos, and the way you
are dressed, you manage to push through and mingle

03:56:46.059 --> 03:56:48.899
well, it wasn't too hard. You make your way
through the town, you can see the tower still

03:56:48.899 --> 03:56:54.651
being held in place and the two figures that you
saw gliding before? As this is happening, and

03:56:54.651 --> 03:56:59.928
you're rushing through, you see a few other bolts
hit, a large bolt of lightning grind down in the

03:57:00.026 --> 03:57:05.418
distance, before eventually they both begin to
peer over and are now looking up and down the

03:57:05.418 --> 03:57:11.382
streets. As you make your way back towards the
alley, over by where the gala is, you see a

03:57:11.382 --> 03:57:17.854
shadowed figure dart out from behind, and a bolt
of lightning strike. There's a detonation of

03:57:17.854 --> 03:57:20.836
burned ozone as the figure falls to the ground,
smoking.

03:57:20.836 --> 03:57:23.030
MARISHA: I go over to the figure, I go over to the
figure.

03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:26.585
MATT: As you walk over to the figure, you see one
of the flying entities floating down. You can see

03:57:26.585 --> 03:57:35.044
now this robed mage figure, with a staff in hand,
wearing a large ornamental mantle, long grayish

03:57:35.044 --> 03:57:38.700
hair, is now gliding down in the direction of the
dark figure of the ground.

03:57:38.700 --> 03:57:39.980
SAM: Male or female?

03:57:39.980 --> 03:57:41.299
MATT: Male.

03:57:41.299 --> 03:57:44.187
LAURA: Steer clear of lightning people!

03:57:44.187 --> 03:57:46.587
MATT: Yeah, you guys see this as you come
around--

03:57:46.587 --> 03:57:47.848
LIAM: Age?

03:57:47.848 --> 03:57:54.577
MATT: The age roughly, from this distance from
what you can see, its later. Older age, 70s human,

03:57:54.577 --> 03:58:00.461
if human, but you can't quite get the details. It
starts shouting, "One has fallen. Find the other,"

03:58:00.461 --> 03:58:04.791
and coasts back off, doing a pass, looking through
the various streets.

03:58:04.791 --> 03:58:07.303
MARISHA: Once he's gone, can I wait to--

03:58:07.303 --> 03:58:09.209
MATT: Well, the guards have rushed forwards and
grabbed the body and are now dragging it back

03:58:09.209 --> 03:58:10.439
towards the tower.

03:58:10.439 --> 03:58:11.495
MARISHA: What does that body look like, though?

03:58:11.495 --> 03:58:12.533
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:58:12.533 --> 03:58:13.542
TRAVIS: Come on.

03:58:14.089 --> 03:58:20.200
MARISHA: Big money-- (screams in anger). Fucking
shit, what is with these fucking rolls! 18. Sorry,

03:58:20.200 --> 03:58:22.196
sorry, no, that's super wrong.

03:58:22.196 --> 03:58:24.357
MATT: Aw, 18!

03:58:24.357 --> 03:58:30.545
MARISHA: I saw an 8 and I was adding shit! 11,
sorry, 11.

03:58:30.545 --> 03:58:36.496
MATT: All you can see is the cloak. The cloak is
blocking most of the body, you see a hand behind

03:58:36.496 --> 03:58:43.182
that's like a leather gauntlet except for fingers
exposed. The fingers appear to be-- the glove or

03:58:43.182 --> 03:58:46.432
design of it are almost like they were dipped in
blue. Like there's some sort of a blue tipped

03:58:46.432 --> 03:58:50.615
glove as its dragged back. That's all the details
you can make out, unfortunately, as it's being

03:58:50.615 --> 03:58:54.795
pulled away off the street. The guards are now
swarming, people are trying to get back to their

03:58:54.795 --> 03:58:58.561
houses. People are swarming the gate out of the
Tri-Spire, and the guards are trying to hold them

03:58:58.561 --> 03:59:02.515
back, calm them down, and it’s nearing a riot at
this point. You guys make your way over to the

03:59:02.515 --> 03:59:06.708
edge of the sewers, begin to look around for a
moment where nobody's watching, and one by one

03:59:06.708 --> 03:59:10.419
make your way down into the darkness, closing it
behind you. As you all get down into the quiet of

03:59:10.419 --> 03:59:15.784
the underground, there's a moment where you can
hear the distant muffling of movement. Footsteps,

03:59:15.784 --> 03:59:20.107
making their way back and forth across the
alleyway, other yells and screams, information in

03:59:20.107 --> 03:59:26.816
the distance, far too far away for you to make out
the details of what's being said. What do you do?

03:59:27.481 --> 03:59:29.185
TRAVIS: Those men were flying!

03:59:29.185 --> 03:59:30.778
MARISHA: Those men were super powerful.

03:59:30.778 --> 03:59:32.501
SAM: We need to get far away from here.

03:59:32.501 --> 03:59:36.254
LAURA: We need to get back to the other side. Oh
my gosh.

03:59:36.254 --> 03:59:38.069
MARISHA: Who were they targeting?

03:59:38.069 --> 03:59:41.390
LAURA: They were targeting-- I don't know!

03:59:41.390 --> 03:59:42.795
LIAM: Not us.

03:59:42.795 --> 03:59:44.509
LAURA: Are you sure they weren't looking for us?

03:59:44.509 --> 03:59:45.628
LIAM: No, I don't think so.

03:59:45.628 --> 03:59:47.041
TALIESIN: This was something entirely different.

03:59:47.041 --> 03:59:49.777
LIAM: We need to go find a shitty place and lay
low.

03:59:49.777 --> 03:59:55.527
MARISHA: He was in blue, his gauntlets were dipped
in blue.

03:59:55.527 --> 03:59:57.557
LAURA: Like the Cobalt people?

03:59:57.557 --> 04:00:01.528
TRAVIS: Let's get back to the Leaky Tap. We've
seen the power of the Dwendalian Empire. That was

04:00:01.528 --> 04:00:04.712
more than anything I've ever seen, we've got to
get back.

04:00:04.712 --> 04:00:06.442
LAURA: I've never seen someone fly before.

04:00:06.442 --> 04:00:12.384
TRAVIS: Neither have I. Lightning, it turned him
almost into ash. Let's get back, we can talk about

04:00:12.384 --> 04:00:14.339
it when we're in our rooms safe.

04:00:14.372 --> 04:00:18.514
LAURA: The High-Richter's dead, you guys. That
wasn't part of the plan!

04:00:18.514 --> 04:00:23.004
SAM: And Ulog too. I think I was sort of mean to
him.

04:00:23.004 --> 04:00:24.704
TALIESIN: What happened?

04:00:24.704 --> 04:00:27.244
MARISHA: I tried to get Ulog to stay and he didn't
listen.

04:00:27.244 --> 04:00:30.010
TRAVIS: Ulog sacrificed himself. He killed himself
and the Richter.

04:00:30.010 --> 04:00:35.240
MATT: Caleb, at this point you glance down and
you're still clutching, in your fingers--

04:00:35.240 --> 04:00:36.554
LIAM: The stone?

04:00:36.554 --> 04:00:38.150
MATT: No, the paper that Ulog left behind.

04:00:38.150 --> 04:00:39.474
LIAM: Oh.

04:00:41.574 --> 04:00:44.016
MATT: Are you guys making your way back?

04:00:44.317 --> 04:00:45.453
TRAVIS: Hell yeah.

04:00:45.453 --> 04:00:47.392
MATT: You're heading back through the sewers the
direction you came.

04:00:47.392 --> 04:00:48.448
LIAM: We are walking away.

04:00:48.448 --> 04:00:49.443
MATT: Okay.

04:00:49.443 --> 04:00:51.010
LAURA: Be aware of the rat balloons.

04:00:51.010 --> 04:00:54.860
MATT: Barely sneaking away from the insanity of
the district, you walk through the darkened sewers

04:00:54.860 --> 04:00:58.378
down the same familiar path that you walked to
make your exit, coming up on one of the false

04:00:58.378 --> 04:01:01.639
junctions, where the left side of it is partially
collapsed but the right side continues to where

04:01:01.639 --> 04:01:08.893
the T-section is. Beauregard, Caleb and Molly and
Jester, because you guys all have the higher

04:01:08.893 --> 04:01:14.658
passive perceptions, you begin to notice this area
where there's no water that drains down the centre

04:01:14.658 --> 04:01:18.016
groove of this part, you see spatters of liquid.

04:01:18.016 --> 04:01:19.818
LAURA: Does it look dark?

04:01:19.818 --> 04:01:20.882
LIAM: What is it?

04:01:20.882 --> 04:01:22.428
MATT: Well, there's no light in here currently.

04:01:22.428 --> 04:01:24.706
LIAM: Ah. (foomph), Dancing Lights.

04:01:24.777 --> 04:01:28.275
MATT: Dancing Lights open up the area here as you
hit the intersection. You see it is dark and red.

04:01:28.275 --> 04:01:29.477
MARISHA: Blood.

04:01:29.477 --> 04:01:32.807
MATT: It is spatters of blood, and as you glance
up right there at the intersection, you see a

04:01:32.807 --> 04:01:39.264
figure, one hand against the wall, breathing
heavily. You glance towards it and take a moment

04:01:39.264 --> 04:01:43.858
as the light globes are now shifting out to light
the space. You see a humanoid figure, seemingly

04:01:43.858 --> 04:01:50.112
male in outline, adorned in jet black, almost
insect-like leather armour that protrudes in large

04:01:50.112 --> 04:01:55.377
sweeping hooks at the joints - the elbow joints,
the shoulders. A helmet that's form-fit black

04:01:55.377 --> 04:02:00.406
leather and onyx studs wraps around their head. It
looks demonic, the brow plate sweeping backwards

04:02:00.406 --> 04:02:06.209
into rear facing horns. Their other hand is
dangling, clutching a cannonball-sized,

04:02:06.209 --> 04:02:11.467
twelve-sided dodecahedron shape, about that big,
that has a handle on each side. It's emitting a

04:02:11.467 --> 04:02:14.275
dull undulating grey glow.

04:02:15.515 --> 04:02:17.594
TRAVIS: I cast Armor of Agathys on myself.

04:02:17.688 --> 04:02:22.704
MATT: As you cast Armor of Agathys on yourself,
the figure, which you now see is the source of the

04:02:22.704 --> 04:02:27.074
blood, looks heavily wounded and is breathing
heavily. The lights now up, its head (creaks)

04:02:27.074 --> 04:02:35.851
turns towards you and you hear a voice say
(guttural speech). Does anybody here speak

04:02:35.851 --> 04:02:37.311
Undercommon?

04:02:37.311 --> 04:02:38.936
TRAVIS: Undercommon, anyone?

04:02:38.936 --> 04:02:41.682
LIAM: I cast Comprehend Languages.

04:02:41.682 --> 04:02:45.811
MATT: What are the components of that one?

04:02:45.811 --> 04:02:52.677
LIAM: That is verbal, somatic, and material. A
pinch of soot of salt which I throw out in front of me.

04:02:52.786 --> 04:02:58.480
MATT: As you begin to make the incantation, the
figure pulls their hand away and draws this

04:02:58.480 --> 04:03:04.178
horrible, gnarly-looking hooked blade from the
sheath, and goes (snarls) and rushes in towards

04:03:04.178 --> 04:03:06.526
you. And that's where we're going to pick up next
week.

04:03:06.526 --> 04:03:12.749
(yelling)

04:03:12.749 --> 04:03:13.780
TALIESIN: No!

04:03:13.780 --> 04:03:16.101
LAURA: Everything went to shit!

04:03:16.155 --> 04:03:18.289
TRAVIS: It went perfectly, ha!

04:03:18.289 --> 04:03:20.668
MARISHA: That was a Crick!

04:03:20.668 --> 04:03:22.148
SAM: What's a Crick?

04:03:22.148 --> 04:03:24.167
LIAM: People from Xhorhas!

04:03:24.167 --> 04:03:26.114
SAM: I thought that was a story.

04:03:26.114 --> 04:03:27.153
LIAM: No!

04:03:27.153 --> 04:03:29.043
MARISHA: Crick assassins!

04:03:29.043 --> 04:03:30.562
LIAM: Trust the porn!

04:03:30.562 --> 04:03:32.338
ALL: Trust the porn!

04:03:32.338 --> 04:03:34.052
MATT: Always trust the porn.

04:03:34.052 --> 04:03:37.176
MARISHA: Edubation! That's why!

04:03:37.176 --> 04:03:39.441
SAM: I should've been more edubated.

04:03:39.441 --> 04:03:42.314
TALIESIN: You would be doing better if you
edubated every night.

04:03:42.404 --> 04:03:50.146
MATT: There were a few chances for you guys to see
High-Richter Prucine arriving, but you kept

04:03:50.146 --> 04:03:52.528
rolling low perception on the outside--

04:03:52.528 --> 04:03:53.750
MARISHA: They were fucking balls!

04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:55.649
MATT: --and I was like, “All right she's going to
get the drop on you guys.” There were so many

04:03:55.649 --> 04:03:58.986
different ways that could've gone. But it made for
an interesting story!

04:03:58.986 --> 04:04:03.396
TALIESIN: That was a clusterfuck. That was
amazing. You're all terrible people.

04:04:03.396 --> 04:04:05.064
LIAM: Edubate once a day.

04:04:08.994 --> 04:04:10.534
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

04:04:10.534 --> 04:04:13.099
SAM: What?! The Crick--

04:04:13.099 --> 04:04:18.757
LIAM: Oh Fjord, it is over. Bromance is over!

04:04:18.790 --> 04:04:24.609
TALIESIN: I cannot wait for this shit! I am in
this shit! Finally, I'm so excited.

04:04:24.609 --> 04:04:25.989
MATT: Aw, man.

04:04:25.989 --> 04:04:27.263
LAURA: It's so good.

04:04:27.263 --> 04:04:28.753
MATT: Guys, that was awesome, well done.

04:04:28.753 --> 04:04:30.188
TRAVIS: And Nott took it anyway!

04:04:30.188 --> 04:04:31.525
MARISHA: I know, she did!

04:04:31.525 --> 04:04:35.188
LIAM: She's dead. The owner is dead.

04:04:35.188 --> 04:04:39.032
MARISHA: Well, now! At the moment, though, there's
no excuse.

04:04:39.032 --> 04:04:41.717
MATT: They don't trust people that don't look
trustworthy like you, Molly.

04:04:41.717 --> 04:04:43.588
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

04:04:43.588 --> 04:04:46.434
MARISHA: Of course. Doesn't mean they're not
shitty selfish ones.

04:04:46.434 --> 04:04:48.445
LIAM: They are shitty selfish ones.

04:04:48.445 --> 04:04:52.385
MATT: All righty guys, thank you so much for
watching. We'll pick this up next week on

04:04:52.385 --> 04:04:57.794
Thursday. Talks Machina next week on Tuesday about
this episode. Look forward to seeing you guys who

04:04:57.794 --> 04:05:01.683
are coming to C2E2. Until then, have a wonderful
night, have a wonderful weekend,

04:05:01.764 --> 04:05:04.529
and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

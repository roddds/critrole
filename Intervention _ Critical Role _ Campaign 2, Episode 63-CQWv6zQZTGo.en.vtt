00:00:00.131 --> 00:00:01.570
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.645
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:05.245
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:07.480
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.725
MATT: (laughs) Good. That's good, that was good.

6
00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:14.527
Before we get into tonight's session,

7
00:00:14.527 --> 00:00:16.403
we have some announcements to get through real fast,

8
00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:17.533
so bear with us.

9
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:21.046
First and foremost, we have our two fantastic sponsors

10
00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:23.880
for tonight. Returning first, our fantastic friends

11
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.280
who've been here since we gave the campaign, D&amp;D Beyond.

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.933
TRAVIS: (operatic) D&amp;D Beyond!

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.913
MATT: Sam.

14
00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:32.187
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond will have their own special streaming pod

15
00:00:32.187 --> 00:00:35.197
at D&amp;D Live, that's this weekend.

16
00:00:35.197 --> 00:00:39.247
Tune into Twitch.tv/dndbeyond

17
00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:40.916
on Saturday.

18
00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:41.808
LAURA: Why is this a thing now?

19
00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:42.641
MATT: I hate it.

20
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.203
SAM: Twitch.tv/dndbeyond

21
00:00:44.203 --> 00:00:45.036
on Saturday

22
00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:48.133
and Sunday starting at 9:00am Pacific.

23
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.917
That's an unusual time to watch Dungeons &amp; Dragons,

24
00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:51.887
but I'm into it.

25
00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.649
To check out all of the awesome announcements, games,

26
00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.346
and special segments.

27
00:00:56.346 --> 00:01:00.046
Now tonight, I realized this week

28
00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:03.918
that we all got our start doing anime dubbing.

29
00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:05.381
LAURA: Yeah!

30
00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:08.517
SAM: It's a weird skill that we all sort of have.

31
00:01:08.517 --> 00:01:11.738
If you guys don't know, there's Japanese shows

32
00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:15.226
and we dub them into English sometimes and you hear

33
00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:16.805
like a, "beep beep beep," and then you have

34
00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:20.516
to match the lip flap and stuff.

35
00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:23.027
We have this skill and we never get to use it anymore,

36
00:01:23.027 --> 00:01:23.898
especially on this show.

37
00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:26.298
So I thought we would do a demonstration

38
00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:29.562
for our audience of our anime dubbing skills.

39
00:01:29.562 --> 00:01:30.395
It'll be a little different

40
00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:34.302
because you guys are going to be lip-syncing to me,

41
00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:38.426
but it'll also serve to be our D&amp;D Beyond ad for the day.

42
00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:40.463
So I'll just demonstrate real quick.

43
00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:41.701
This is just a demonstration.

44
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.990
Hit that first file.

45
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.597
(beeping)

46
00:01:46.597 --> 00:01:48.431
SAM (VO): Hi there! I'm Sam Riegel.

47
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:51.834
D&amp;D Beyond is the official tool set of Critical Role.

48
00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:54.253
You can check rules, save your characters,

49
00:01:54.253 --> 00:01:58.191
and manage campaigns all from their handy digital interface.

50
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:02.982
It's D&amp;D-rific!

51
00:02:02.982 --> 00:02:04.240
(laughter)

52
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.749
SAM: That's it, so I thought--

53
00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.389
LAURA: This kind of opposite of what we normally do.

54
00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:08.906
SAM: It's the opposite of dubbing.

55
00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:11.738
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is the original Japanese before.

56
00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:14.797
SAM: Now what I'd like to do is kick it over to my friends

57
00:02:14.797 --> 00:02:17.240
over here: Travis, Marisha, and Liam.

58
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.818
LIAM: We are not your friends.

59
00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:21.553
SAM: I thought they could each dub a line

60
00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:24.253
to show us how it's done, sort of.

61
00:02:24.253 --> 00:02:26.376
Then we could pick a winner.

62
00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:29.219
The winner gets a two dollar bill.

63
00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.644
(laughter)

64
00:02:30.644 --> 00:02:31.882
LAURA: Where is the two dollar bill?

65
00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:33.144
MATT: From Taliesin's wallet.

66
00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:36.077
TALIESIN: Did you pull it from my wallet?

67
00:02:36.077 --> 00:02:37.782
SAM: I have a two dollar bill.

68
00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.989
MARISHA: Taliesin has deep beliefs in two dollar bills.

69
00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.822
TALIESIN: I do. They're wonderful.

70
00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.155
SAM: Okay, so first up is Travis Willingham.

71
00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:46.230
Travis-- hit that second file.

72
00:02:47.242 --> 00:02:49.493
(beeping)

73
00:02:49.493 --> 00:02:52.823
SAM (VO): The year is 2424

74
00:02:52.823 --> 00:02:55.634
and no one in Neo Japan is safe.

75
00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:59.993
For I, Turovis Willinghamu, leader of the paper

76
00:02:59.993 --> 00:03:03.214
and pen Yakuza will unleash a deadly wave

77
00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:05.220
of adorable battle monsters

78
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.313
on Critical Role cram school number seven

79
00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:11.897
and I will rule the planet!

80
00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:16.897
SAM (VO): (laughs)

81
00:03:17.753 --> 00:03:19.036
(inhale)

82
00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:23.694
(groaning)
(laughter)

83
00:03:23.694 --> 00:03:26.407
SAM: Excellent work, Travis. Really good.

84
00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:29.255
(laughter)

85
00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:31.791
SAM: This two dollar bill could be yours.

86
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:33.007
LAURA: (laughs)

87
00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:36.101
MARISHA: That was so unsettling in such a weird way.

88
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:38.405
SAM: Okay, raise it-- kick up the volume

89
00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:39.845
for us a little, if you could.

90
00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:41.061
LAURA: You got a big paragraph there.

91
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:43.064
SAM: I know. Marisha has a lot. Sorry, Marisha.

92
00:03:43.064 --> 00:03:45.658
It's up to you. Can you steal this two dollar bill?

93
00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:47.533
Here we go. Hit that third key.

94
00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:48.366
LAURA: You can do it, Marisha!

95
00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:50.883
(beeping sound)

96
00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:53.356
SAM (VO): (high-pitched) Nani! No way! We'll never let paper

97
00:03:53.356 --> 00:03:56.642
and pen win! There's a better, more organized way

98
00:03:56.642 --> 00:04:00.042
to play D&amp;D! I'm just a transfer student who doesn't

99
00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:02.687
understand the power I have inside me,

100
00:04:02.687 --> 00:04:05.322
but today is our cram school's cultural festival

101
00:04:05.322 --> 00:04:09.610
and our hot springs-themed maid cafe needs to be perfect.

102
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.335
Therefore, my burning grip commands me to defeat you.

103
00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:19.335
Take my passion, my rage, and all my pain!

104
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:23.871
Shining Thumb Sword Exorcist Attack! Believe it!

105
00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:28.804
I am Gundam! D&amp;D Beyond level 9,000!

106
00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:32.111
MATT: Oh god.
TRAVIS: Wow.

107
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.828
(applause)
TRAVIS: Wow, strong finish!

108
00:04:33.828 --> 00:04:34.829
SAM: That was good!

109
00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:36.036
TRAVIS: Strong finish!

110
00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.064
SAM: That was great!
ASHLEY: Oh man!

111
00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:42.644
SAM: Liam O'Brien, take us home with that third clip.

112
00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:43.482
This is all you.

113
00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:45.133
LIAM: Waiting for the twist of the knife.

114
00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:48.701
SAM (VO): Marisha-kun, no! you can't defeat him on your own.

115
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:52.679
You need the strength and the Super Ultra Robo Blue

116
00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:56.414
Gundam Soul Eater Bot Musashi Bebop Titan

117
00:04:56.414 --> 00:04:59.413
Defender A-class Warrior Mech!

118
00:04:59.413 --> 00:05:03.754
Also known as Mecha D&amp;D Beyond!

119
00:05:03.754 --> 00:05:08.235
Mecha D&amp;D Beyond, I summon thee by

120
00:05:08.235 --> 00:05:11.072
the power of http

121
00:05:11.072 --> 00:05:14.602
colon forward slash forward slash

122
00:05:14.602 --> 00:05:19.510
dndbeyond dot com!

123
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.335
(yelling)

124
00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:24.677
(laughter)

125
00:05:24.677 --> 00:05:26.973
SAM: Oh, that is some classic anime.

126
00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:30.199
(applause)

127
00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.892
MATT: Literally reverse dubbing.

128
00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:34.201
You completely undercut your whole point.

129
00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:39.563
SAM: The judges have spoken.

130
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:42.812
Magical girl Marisha has won it.

131
00:05:42.812 --> 00:05:45.577
(applause)

132
00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:47.802
MARISHA: Not even from Texas!

133
00:05:47.802 --> 00:05:49.168
(laughter)

134
00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:51.249
SAM: That's how you dub!

135
00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:53.177
Anyway, thanks D&amp;D Beyond,

136
00:05:53.177 --> 00:05:56.637
and have a pleasant weekend at the D&amp;D live event.

137
00:05:56.637 --> 00:05:59.047
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

138
00:05:59.047 --> 00:06:02.513
On a much more calm note,

139
00:06:02.513 --> 00:06:05.096
our second sponsor tonight returning,

140
00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:06.698
our friends at Eldritch Foundry.

141
00:06:06.698 --> 00:06:08.417
Those who don't know,

142
00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:11.906
they just recently kicked off this amazing Kickstarter.

143
00:06:11.906 --> 00:06:14.712
They are massive critters and have been

144
00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:16.674
for a long time. They are setting up their

145
00:06:16.674 --> 00:06:20.387
own customizable 3D-printed miniature program

146
00:06:20.387 --> 00:06:22.491
for you to go ahead and check out.

147
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:25.704
Their campaign right now has already unlocked distinct races

148
00:06:25.704 --> 00:06:27.464
like tieflings, dragonborns, goliaths, and gnomes.

149
00:06:27.464 --> 00:06:29.766
They have more goals to hit, which unlock animal creatures

150
00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:31.823
like kenku, tortles, and werewolves.

151
00:06:31.823 --> 00:06:33.929
Their next stretch goal, I think, is steampunk items,

152
00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:35.448
as well as the war forge

153
00:06:35.448 --> 00:06:38.984
they're hoping for, which is pretty awesome.

154
00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:41.720
You can go check out their fantastic Kickstarter

155
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.515
at critrole.com/eldritchfoundry for more information

156
00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:47.515
to see if it's your bag.

157
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:49.837
Right now, there's a special promotion

158
00:06:49.837 --> 00:06:52.130
for tonight. They're giving away two of

159
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.530
their Dark Temple Kickstarter tiers.

160
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.012
They have $500 value-- on their official social outlets:

161
00:06:58.012 --> 00:06:59.750
one on Twitter and one on Facebook.

162
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.756
Head over there now for a chance to win

163
00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:03.793
your own character commission

164
00:07:03.793 --> 00:07:06.844
and an item designed by Critter artist Ilya Salnikov,

165
00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:10.699
who is amazing. Their work is incredible.

166
00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.297
Thank you so much, and super excited for you guys.

167
00:07:13.297 --> 00:07:15.430
(cheering)

168
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.539
(applause)

169
00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:19.956
MATT: All right. Speaking of the the D&amp;D stream,

170
00:07:21.553 --> 00:07:23.142
a few of us are going to be doing that this weekend.

171
00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:24.686
Taliesin, you're up tomorrow, right?

172
00:07:24.686 --> 00:07:26.660
TALIESIN: Yeah, I got to finish some stuff.

173
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.451
Yeah.

174
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:29.284
SAM: Are you running a game?

175
00:07:29.284 --> 00:07:32.228
TALIESIN: No, I just haven't finished

176
00:07:32.228 --> 00:07:34.574
getting everything together that I'm doing.

177
00:07:34.574 --> 00:07:35.924
I know, never, so...

178
00:07:35.924 --> 00:07:37.595
MATT: You're playing with some cool people and some friends.

179
00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:38.428
It's going to be awesome.

180
00:07:38.428 --> 00:07:39.386
TALIESIN: I'm excited and nervous.

181
00:07:39.386 --> 00:07:40.219
MATT: Then on Saturday,

182
00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:42.879
Marisha's running a game, which is going to be amazing.

183
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.535
Yeah, she's dungeon mastering. It's going to be badass.

184
00:07:46.377 --> 00:07:49.375
MARISHA: I also have to finish some things.

185
00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:51.620
(laughter)

186
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.248
MATT: You got this.

187
00:07:53.248 --> 00:07:54.804
MARISHA: It's Friday, tomorrow.

188
00:07:54.804 --> 00:07:55.637
MATT: Yeah.

189
00:07:55.637 --> 00:07:58.603
Then I'm playing tomorrow as well, later in the afternoon.

190
00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.234
I get to step into the shoes of a lore character

191
00:08:01.234 --> 00:08:02.345
I'm excited about.

192
00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:03.859
I think there'll be more information about it tomorrow,

193
00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:05.833
but I'm pretty excited.

194
00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:08.425
So check it out on D&amp;D's Twitch channel

195
00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:10.758
throughout the weekend.

196
00:08:10.758 --> 00:08:11.825
In case you guys missed it,

197
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.898
we announced that we are finally, after--

198
00:08:14.898 --> 00:08:17.625
we're a small company with a certain number of people

199
00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:18.473
and there's only so much we can do

200
00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:19.306
at any given point in time--

201
00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:20.139
but we've been working really hard,

202
00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:23.257
and we finally got the cosplay galleries up and running.

203
00:08:23.257 --> 00:08:25.571
We've been working on that for awhile.

204
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.805
LIAM: We've been talking about it for ages.

205
00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:29.701
MARISHA: It took a lot of infrastructure.

206
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:31.357
You'd be surprised.

207
00:08:31.357 --> 00:08:33.050
MATT: Everything takes a lot.

208
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.967
Everything takes a lot.

209
00:08:36.007 --> 00:08:37.491
Thanks to the hard work of the amazing people

210
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:38.699
here on our team,

211
00:08:38.699 --> 00:08:41.649
they'll be coming to our website soon.

212
00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:43.397
We've all seen some of the incredible cosplay

213
00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:44.789
that this community has produced

214
00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:46.533
and we want to be able to to show that off

215
00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:50.421
and also include possible prizes for Talks Machina

216
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:51.524
for folks here and there.

217
00:08:51.524 --> 00:08:53.269
Mainly just celebrate this amazing

218
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:55.141
group of cosplayers out there

219
00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:56.293
that are part of this community.

220
00:08:56.293 --> 00:08:58.085
We're launching the Cosplay of the Week Contest

221
00:08:58.085 --> 00:08:59.557
on Talks next week.

222
00:08:59.557 --> 00:09:01.680
You can go to critrole.com for all the details

223
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.527
and visit critrole.com/submit

224
00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:05.241
to see how to submit your cosplay.

225
00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:08.357
The other news we put up,

226
00:09:08.357 --> 00:09:10.440
which I'm still processing,

227
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.021
in celebration of Red Nose Day,

228
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:13.445
which is an amazing charity.

229
00:09:13.445 --> 00:09:16.077
It's an annual fundraising event

230
00:09:16.077 --> 00:09:18.085
to help end childhood poverty.

231
00:09:18.085 --> 00:09:19.397
They do incredible work every year.

232
00:09:19.397 --> 00:09:20.230
If you haven't checked it out,

233
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.063
I highly recommended it.

234
00:09:21.063 --> 00:09:23.438
We've teamed up with Stephen Colbert.

235
00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.003
LAURA: (yelling)

236
00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:25.836
TRAVIS: Colbert!

237
00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:28.533
MATT: To create a very special mini one-shot

238
00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:33.283
I'm going to be running one-on-one for him next week.

239
00:09:33.283 --> 00:09:35.557
Going to New York to run on one-on-one

240
00:09:35.557 --> 00:09:38.390
mini campaign for Stephen Colbert.

241
00:09:39.922 --> 00:09:42.953
I don't think it's hit me yet.

242
00:09:42.953 --> 00:09:47.523
It will air our YouTube channel on May 23rd.

243
00:09:47.523 --> 00:09:49.077
LAURA: How can fans participate?

244
00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:50.069
MATT: As part of this campaign,

245
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:52.165
you get to shape aspects of the storyline.

246
00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:55.557
If you go to critrole.com/rednoseday,

247
00:09:55.557 --> 00:09:57.330
you can vote now with your donations

248
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.315
towards many of the different facets of the story

249
00:09:59.315 --> 00:10:00.709
that you want to see make it there.

250
00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:02.508
We have choices for which companion

251
00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:04.709
goes along with Stephen on his adventures,

252
00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:07.301
we get to choose which kind of magical artifact

253
00:10:07.301 --> 00:10:09.045
that Stephen is looking for,

254
00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:11.765
we get to choose what class he plays,

255
00:10:11.765 --> 00:10:13.541
and then we also get to choose

256
00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:15.797
who the ultimate villain is of the campaign.

257
00:10:15.797 --> 00:10:17.255
TALIESIN: Queen Bee.

258
00:10:17.255 --> 00:10:19.308
MATT: Taliesin has some preferences.

259
00:10:19.308 --> 00:10:20.837
At first there were some front runners

260
00:10:20.837 --> 00:10:22.405
that I was like, "Oh, well, this is already decided,"

261
00:10:22.405 --> 00:10:24.787
but there has been some neck-and-neck fights

262
00:10:24.787 --> 00:10:25.669
the past couple days

263
00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:26.597
with donations.
LAURA: Everything's down

264
00:10:26.597 --> 00:10:27.430
to two really hardcore--

265
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.045
MATT: Yeah, so check it out

266
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.501
if you want to participate

267
00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:33.616
and help donate to support this amazing cause.

268
00:10:33.616 --> 00:10:34.628
Go ahead and check it out.

269
00:10:34.628 --> 00:10:37.088
That's critrole.com/rednoseday.

270
00:10:37.088 --> 00:10:38.822
Look forward to showing you guys

271
00:10:38.822 --> 00:10:42.101
this ridiculous bucket list item that's happening

272
00:10:42.101 --> 00:10:43.018
that I'm...

273
00:10:44.719 --> 00:10:48.514
Yeah, I don't know what's happening anymore.

274
00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:50.806
I never know what's happening anymore.

275
00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:52.223
On that note,

276
00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:58.099
let's go ahead and bring us in to tonight's episode of

277
00:10:58.099 --> 00:10:59.548

(dragon roaring)

318
00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:39.441
MATT: Hello and welcome back.

319
00:12:40.702 --> 00:12:44.079
So last we left off, the Mighty Nein,

320
00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:48.719
you had, after achieving a couple of fairly decent goals

321
00:12:48.719 --> 00:12:51.167
for the city of Rosohna and for the Kryn dynasty.

322
00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:54.335
Both returning one of their Luxon Beacons

323
00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:55.612
to the Bright Queen,

324
00:12:55.612 --> 00:12:58.847
and then after that, completing a mission

325
00:12:58.847 --> 00:13:02.910
out towards a giant-infested mine and steelworks.

326
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.671
Managed to get the giants back to their home,

327
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:07.903
free it of the incursion

328
00:13:07.903 --> 00:13:12.476
from some sort of seemingly placed abyssal assault

329
00:13:12.476 --> 00:13:14.989
and returned to gain your prize.

330
00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:16.975
For this goodwill,

331
00:13:16.975 --> 00:13:21.475
you've been gifted with a house within the Firmaments.

332
00:13:25.343 --> 00:13:26.831
Upon returning that evening,

333
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:30.255
you then decorated, bought furniture,

334
00:13:30.255 --> 00:13:34.806
made a tree in the tower,

335
00:13:34.806 --> 00:13:36.848
met some of the neighbors,

336
00:13:36.848 --> 00:13:38.687
went ahead and did some shopping,

337
00:13:38.687 --> 00:13:40.837
wandered the city a bit, gathered some information,

338
00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:45.837
and all leading to this supposed meeting point

339
00:13:46.303 --> 00:13:48.015
at the Overcrow Apothecary

340
00:13:48.015 --> 00:13:49.599
where this individual you had scryed,

341
00:13:49.599 --> 00:13:53.647
who seemed to be involved with these these abyssal anchors

342
00:13:53.647 --> 00:13:55.551
that you found now in two locations in Xhorhas,

343
00:13:55.551 --> 00:13:57.051
was going to meet.

344
00:13:58.458 --> 00:13:59.807
You were preparing for this,

345
00:13:59.807 --> 00:14:01.631
went ahead and scryed again

346
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:04.878
and seemed to pick up more information.

347
00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:06.350
This figure, this individual

348
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.199
was peripheral to other individuals out of sight

349
00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:12.207
who are discussing some sort of war plans.

350
00:14:12.207 --> 00:14:14.415
With this information, you had decided to go ahead

351
00:14:14.415 --> 00:14:16.351
and make your way towards the Lucid Bastion

352
00:14:16.351 --> 00:14:17.759
in the center of the city

353
00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:19.279
and inform the Bright Queen, perhaps,

354
00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.135
of what you heard.

355
00:14:21.135 --> 00:14:23.718
And that was where we left off.

356
00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:25.889
So Mighty Nein,

357
00:14:27.552 --> 00:14:32.078
on the evening before the day of the supposed meeting

358
00:14:32.078 --> 00:14:32.911
you've gathered your things,

359
00:14:32.911 --> 00:14:34.046
you've left your new home,

360
00:14:34.046 --> 00:14:36.382
and you begin walking through the Firmaments

361
00:14:36.382 --> 00:14:38.459
towards the Lucid Bastion.

362
00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:41.267
As you approach-- well, first off,

363
00:14:41.267 --> 00:14:43.792
I'm going to give whoever had the suude,

364
00:14:43.792 --> 00:14:45.817
I have your sheet here for you.

365
00:14:45.817 --> 00:14:46.833
LAURA: Oh shit.

366
00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:49.293
MATT: I do have that from last week.

367
00:14:49.293 --> 00:14:51.259
TALIESIN: Well, that's back in play.

368
00:14:52.309 --> 00:14:53.875
MATT: Yeah.

369
00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:57.250
That's what happens when you steal from smugglers.

370
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.517
(clears throat)

371
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.086
First off, is there anything you want to prepare or discuss

372
00:15:03.086 --> 00:15:04.907
before you get to the Bastion?

373
00:15:04.907 --> 00:15:07.168
SAM: I would just like to say,

374
00:15:07.168 --> 00:15:10.318
the last time we saw the Bright Queenie,

375
00:15:10.318 --> 00:15:12.235
when things went wrong,

376
00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.781
we pulled out a thing

377
00:15:19.087 --> 00:15:20.428
smartly, smartly.

378
00:15:20.428 --> 00:15:22.366
Is there anything else that we have on our person

379
00:15:22.366 --> 00:15:27.366
that we should not have before we walk into this room?

380
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:30.126
Do we have that little vial of you know what?

381
00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:31.214
LIAM: We do.

382
00:15:31.214 --> 00:15:33.198
SAM: Should we not have that?

383
00:15:33.198 --> 00:15:35.502
LAURA: I think that's okay.

384
00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:38.028
It's not like they worship the little vial thingie.

385
00:15:38.028 --> 00:15:39.054
SAM: What about the tripod?

386
00:15:39.054 --> 00:15:41.881
Are we not supposed to have that?

387
00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:44.571
TALIESIN: I don't think that even necessarily, no--

388
00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:48.974
LIAM: I think the relevance was just to their holy item.

389
00:15:48.974 --> 00:15:50.198
TRAVIS: Good thought, though.

390
00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:51.626
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Do we have that

391
00:15:51.626 --> 00:15:55.094
rift disk portal thing?

392
00:15:55.094 --> 00:15:56.708
LAURA: No.
SAM: We broke it.

393
00:15:56.708 --> 00:15:58.230
LAURA: Nott destroyed it.

394
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.554
SAM: But did we hang onto it?

395
00:15:59.554 --> 00:16:00.387
I don't know--

396
00:16:00.387 --> 00:16:01.220
TALIESIN: We did.

397
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.562
We had all the pieces
LAURA: It mostly shattered.

398
00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:05.478
MATT: The center part of it had been broken,

399
00:16:05.478 --> 00:16:08.214
but the general structure of the outer ring

400
00:16:08.214 --> 00:16:09.113
was still intact.

401
00:16:09.113 --> 00:16:09.946
TALIESIN: The frisbee.

402
00:16:09.946 --> 00:16:11.071
SAM: That's good to have though, right?

403
00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:13.330
LAURA: Yeah, we should definitely show her that.

404
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.256
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

405
00:16:14.256 --> 00:16:16.271
SAM: Is there any other evidence that we should know about

406
00:16:16.271 --> 00:16:17.604
before we go in?

407
00:16:20.773 --> 00:16:22.595
What do we say?

408
00:16:22.595 --> 00:16:24.654
MARISHA: I just don't want to die

409
00:16:24.654 --> 00:16:26.642
because she thinks that--

410
00:16:26.642 --> 00:16:29.326
SAM: Oh, we have one other piece of evidence!

411
00:16:29.326 --> 00:16:31.154
We have the little blue piece of cloth, right?

412
00:16:31.154 --> 00:16:31.987
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

413
00:16:31.987 --> 00:16:34.050
SAM: She could use that to verify our scrying,

414
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.275
maybe.
LAURA: Yeah.

415
00:16:35.275 --> 00:16:36.812
MARISHA: Sure, I guess.

416
00:16:36.812 --> 00:16:38.698
We don't need it anymore, right?

417
00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:39.531
SAM: No.

418
00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:41.594
LAURA: I know what he looks like.

419
00:16:41.594 --> 00:16:44.106
I can scry on him pretty easily now I think.

420
00:16:44.106 --> 00:16:47.047
TRAVIS: So all the places that we've seen rifts, right:

421
00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:50.583
we've seen them in the giant hoard,

422
00:16:50.583 --> 00:16:53.735
we've seen it in the well, right?

423
00:16:53.735 --> 00:16:55.847
LAURA: Yes, in another city, not here.

424
00:16:55.847 --> 00:16:57.365
SAM: That was in the beast city.

425
00:16:57.365 --> 00:16:58.917
TRAVIS: Yeah, but still under this territory.

426
00:16:58.917 --> 00:16:59.975
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:16:59.975 --> 00:17:01.908
TRAVIS: Then, was there a third place?

428
00:17:01.908 --> 00:17:04.071
SAM: There was two places in that in the City of Beasts.

429
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:05.591
TRAVIS: Oh that's right, yeah, two.

430
00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.783
So this is the third time we've seen it.

431
00:17:07.783 --> 00:17:09.367
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

432
00:17:09.367 --> 00:17:10.200
TRAVIS: All right.
SAM: Okay.

433
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.302
LAURA: He made it seem like-- well,

434
00:17:13.302 --> 00:17:14.311
if he's placing them,

435
00:17:14.311 --> 00:17:16.726
how many more he could have placed?

436
00:17:16.726 --> 00:17:17.559
That's crazy.

437
00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:18.775
SAM: And we're all agreeing

438
00:17:18.775 --> 00:17:20.298
that me and Jester are doing the talking?

439
00:17:20.298 --> 00:17:23.031
You guys are just going to take a back seat?

440
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:23.864
We've got this.

441
00:17:23.864 --> 00:17:24.935
LAURA: She really likes us.
TRAVIS: I think I'm going to

442
00:17:24.935 --> 00:17:27.394
option out of that one as well.

443
00:17:27.394 --> 00:17:30.007
I think maybe this should be a group effort, right, yep.

444
00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:32.103
I think we should also include our knowledge

445
00:17:32.103 --> 00:17:34.598
of-- what was the place we just visited?

446
00:17:34.598 --> 00:17:37.436
They have the real nice massage in the front?

447
00:17:37.436 --> 00:17:40.166
You got the chestal rubbed it going down?

448
00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:42.471
MARISHA: Oh, oh, the Overcrow.

449
00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:44.304
TRAVIS: Overcrow, thank you.

450
00:17:46.347 --> 00:17:49.317
ASHLEY: I could always do all the talking as well.

451
00:17:49.317 --> 00:17:50.327
SAM: That would be great actually.

452
00:17:50.327 --> 00:17:52.444
I would like that.

453
00:17:52.444 --> 00:17:54.437
LAURA: You're pretty charismatic.

454
00:17:54.437 --> 00:17:56.694
ASHLEY: I'm a big talker, I know.

455
00:17:56.694 --> 00:17:58.711
SAM: You have a Xhorhasian accent.

456
00:17:58.711 --> 00:17:59.623
So it would help.

457
00:17:59.623 --> 00:18:01.575
ASHLEY: No, we'll see if would come in handy.

458
00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:06.124
TRAVIS: No day like the present day, I'm all about it.

459
00:18:06.124 --> 00:18:07.493
Caduceus, how you feeling?

460
00:18:07.493 --> 00:18:08.326
TALIESIN: Uh...

461
00:18:09.458 --> 00:18:10.466
SAM: Enough said.

462
00:18:10.466 --> 00:18:12.066
TALIESIN: Yeah.

463
00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:13.410
This is complicated.
LIAM: He's got some heavy

464
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.910
Disney Baloo vibes.

465
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:23.049
TALIESIN: Let's just tell them nothing but the bare necessities.

466
00:18:23.146 --> 00:18:26.119
ASHLEY: Yeah, the simple bare necessities.

467
00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:28.530
TALIESIN: I was trying to figure out a City of Beasts

468
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.496
well alone Tumbleweeds song joke,

469
00:18:30.496 --> 00:18:31.454
but never mind.

470
00:18:31.454 --> 00:18:32.930
LIAM: Let's talk out

471
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.402
what we are going to be discussing with her.

472
00:18:36.402 --> 00:18:39.010
LAURA: Well, we'll tell her that we went

473
00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.169
and there was the rift, right?

474
00:18:41.169 --> 00:18:45.109
That we got that order from Professor Waccoh.

475
00:18:45.109 --> 00:18:46.161
SAM: One of her people.

476
00:18:46.161 --> 00:18:47.986
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. We went and took care of it

477
00:18:47.986 --> 00:18:50.242
and found another one of the disks.

478
00:18:50.242 --> 00:18:52.825
We scryed on the the fabric,

479
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.138
those left behind on the desk,

480
00:18:55.138 --> 00:18:56.250
and that's how we found it out.

481
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.512
That's it.

482
00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:58.770
SAM: Just the truth.

483
00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.932
Caduceus always says.

484
00:18:59.932 --> 00:19:02.130
MARISHA: We overheard about the attack in the incursion--

485
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.728
TALIESIN: Why didn't we tell them sooner?

486
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:08.113
LAURA: We did.
SAM: To verify.

487
00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:09.075
We needed to verify.

488
00:19:09.075 --> 00:19:11.446
MARISHA: We just got back today.

489
00:19:11.446 --> 00:19:12.470
SAM: A week ago.

490
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.303
MARISHA: A week ago.

491
00:19:13.303 --> 00:19:14.146
We just got back a week ago.

492
00:19:14.146 --> 00:19:15.190
SAM: We had to settle the house.

493
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.766
LAURA: We're going to her as soon as I scryed.

494
00:19:17.766 --> 00:19:18.630
It's not like--

495
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.686
TRAVIS: We tried to prepare as much information

496
00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:21.063
as possible.
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, to be fair,

497
00:19:21.063 --> 00:19:24.118
I guess there wasn't really an intense thing

498
00:19:24.118 --> 00:19:25.046
until just now.

499
00:19:25.046 --> 00:19:25.879
MARISHA: Yeah.

500
00:19:25.879 --> 00:19:28.774
LAURA: The first time it was just a dude writing in a book.

501
00:19:28.774 --> 00:19:32.150
Now we know he's with the other guys

502
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.936
and they're planning an attack.

503
00:19:33.936 --> 00:19:37.958
TALIESIN: I personally would like to see how she

504
00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.254
reacts to this information

505
00:19:39.254 --> 00:19:42.806
before we start offering our notions

506
00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:44.790
on what the best course of action is.

507
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:49.790
I would like to maybe get a sense of her immediate concerns

508
00:19:50.198 --> 00:19:51.419
and character.

509
00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:55.158
MARISHA: Yeah, what if she rallies all the troops

510
00:19:55.158 --> 00:19:58.358
and drags out the war machines and--

511
00:19:58.358 --> 00:20:01.348
TALIESIN: Well, then we can say on the other hand--

512
00:20:01.348 --> 00:20:04.419
LAURA: We need to, you know, capture the guy first.

513
00:20:04.419 --> 00:20:06.358
We need to make sure we have somebody

514
00:20:06.358 --> 00:20:08.406
really powerful with us

515
00:20:08.406 --> 00:20:10.886
because I have a feeling this guy's pretty strong.

516
00:20:10.886 --> 00:20:14.150
If he's coming over here alone multiple times

517
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.251
and setting these traps,

518
00:20:15.251 --> 00:20:19.334
he's probably got some tricks up his sleeve.

519
00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:21.299
MARISHA: The attack on the garrison

520
00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:26.054
could be any day now, any hour now, realistically.

521
00:20:26.054 --> 00:20:27.862
TALIESIN: We should do what we can

522
00:20:27.862 --> 00:20:29.638
to save as many lives as possible.

523
00:20:29.638 --> 00:20:32.165
LAURA: I think if we get him first though,

524
00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:34.342
then he will know more details.

525
00:20:34.342 --> 00:20:36.342
MARISHA: That's true.

526
00:20:36.342 --> 00:20:37.175
TALIESIN: Sure.

527
00:20:37.175 --> 00:20:38.980
MARISHA: He's supposed to be at the Overcrow.

528
00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.688
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

529
00:20:40.688 --> 00:20:43.590
I just thought of something.

530
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.470
What if I try to locate

531
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.616
that book that he was writing in?

532
00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:51.030
We could Locate Object

533
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.848
that if he's in the city

534
00:20:52.848 --> 00:20:55.188
and he had that book,

535
00:20:55.188 --> 00:20:56.742
he would have all of the plans.

536
00:20:56.742 --> 00:20:58.884
He was writing it all down in there.

537
00:20:58.884 --> 00:21:00.582
TRAVIS: If he was in the city?

538
00:21:00.582 --> 00:21:02.502
I thought we thought he might not be,

539
00:21:02.502 --> 00:21:03.894
like he was back in the Empire, I thought.

540
00:21:03.894 --> 00:21:06.886
LAURA: Well, but if he's meeting at the Overcrow tomorrow,

541
00:21:06.886 --> 00:21:08.370
then he might be around.

542
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.203
TRAVIS: Yeah.

543
00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:10.418
TALIESIN: Is it tomorrow or tonight?

544
00:21:10.418 --> 00:21:11.712
LAURA: Tomorrow.
MATT: Tomorrow is when

545
00:21:11.712 --> 00:21:13.795
the Overcrow meeting is supposed to happen.

546
00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:14.628
TALIESIN: Well, it would be best

547
00:21:14.628 --> 00:21:18.291
to have some sort of official permission

548
00:21:18.291 --> 00:21:19.957
to be skulking around,

549
00:21:19.957 --> 00:21:23.318
if we're going to go back to skulking.

550
00:21:23.318 --> 00:21:25.890
I'd just prefer for them to know

551
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.110
that we have a plan.

552
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:32.077
LIAM: Also, if we attempt to talk her out of

553
00:21:34.074 --> 00:21:36.662
backing out of the garrison, as you suggested,

554
00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:39.537
it could tip off our friends back home

555
00:21:39.537 --> 00:21:41.014
that something is wrong

556
00:21:41.014 --> 00:21:45.798
and spook our blond friend, <i>ja</i>?

557
00:21:45.798 --> 00:21:46.631
LAURA: Right.

558
00:21:46.631 --> 00:21:49.254
MARISHA: Well, I'm sure they know that there are spies.

559
00:21:49.254 --> 00:21:51.187
It doesn't have to be us, though.

560
00:21:51.187 --> 00:21:53.387
They don't know that much.

561
00:21:53.387 --> 00:21:54.691
LAURA: Does that mean that the goblin

562
00:21:54.691 --> 00:21:57.090
that's running the Overcrow

563
00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.067
is actually working for the Empire?

564
00:22:00.067 --> 00:22:01.093
TALIESIN: I think it does.

565
00:22:01.093 --> 00:22:03.701
SAM: You can never trust a goblin.

566
00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:05.077
LAURA: That's something I've always said.

567
00:22:05.077 --> 00:22:07.337
SAM: That's something that we've all always said.

568
00:22:07.337 --> 00:22:10.437
LAURA: No, we haven't said that, Nott.

569
00:22:10.437 --> 00:22:12.970
MARISHA: There's clearly moles on both sides.

570
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.303
Any type of war effort has to know that.

571
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.827
TALIESIN: Well, maybe they'll see the the sense

572
00:22:19.827 --> 00:22:23.237
in just taking one's time, being careful,

573
00:22:23.237 --> 00:22:26.092
maybe not showing your hand.

574
00:22:26.092 --> 00:22:27.842
LIAM: We counsel caution.

575
00:22:28.794 --> 00:22:30.885
TRAVIS: Remove those moles

576
00:22:30.885 --> 00:22:31.718
one at a time.
LAURA: That's right.

577
00:22:31.718 --> 00:22:32.741
You should always check them out

578
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:36.245
because they could lead to worse things.

579
00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:39.045
Yeah, it could be real bad.

580
00:22:39.995 --> 00:22:42.047
TRAVIS: Let's go.
SAM: Let's do this.

581
00:22:42.047 --> 00:22:45.085
MATT: As you approach the exterior of Lucid Bastion

582
00:22:45.085 --> 00:22:47.340
at this point in the evening,

583
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:52.340
a cluster of six Aurora Watch guards approach,

584
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:55.469
the leader of them hand up.

585
00:22:55.469 --> 00:22:58.557
"Halt, what is your business at the Bastion?"

586
00:22:58.557 --> 00:23:00.660
LAURA: We have really important--

587
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.186
should I be the one talking?

588
00:23:02.186 --> 00:23:04.573
We have some really important information

589
00:23:04.573 --> 00:23:07.921
that the Bright Queen will want to hear about.

590
00:23:07.921 --> 00:23:09.388
TRAVIS: Show 'em your--

591
00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.604
TALIESIN: It really can't wait.

592
00:23:10.604 --> 00:23:13.405
LAURA: This is the emblem, seriously.

593
00:23:13.405 --> 00:23:14.333
MATT: "For the Bright Queen right now."

594
00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:16.083
LAURA: It is so important.

595
00:23:19.248 --> 00:23:20.806
TRAVIS: Multipass.

596
00:23:21.771 --> 00:23:26.397
MATT: All these badges. He's like, "Fine, put it down.

597
00:23:26.397 --> 00:23:27.814
"Luxon be praised.

598
00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:34.266
"All right, I will see if she is available.

599
00:23:35.437 --> 00:23:38.765
"Please come within the antechamber."

600
00:23:38.765 --> 00:23:40.635
All the guards flank around,

601
00:23:40.635 --> 00:23:42.845
not aggressively, but they escort you in,

602
00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:43.741
an armed escort,

603
00:23:43.741 --> 00:23:48.074
back through the echoing halls of the Lucid Bastion.

604
00:23:48.924 --> 00:23:51.133
LAURA: I ring the bell as soon as we walk in.

605
00:23:51.133 --> 00:23:53.383
(laughter)

606
00:23:54.605 --> 00:23:56.463
MATT: This guy comes rushing out--

607
00:23:57.363 --> 00:23:58.639
(sighs)

608
00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:00.301
Goes back to business.

609
00:24:00.301 --> 00:24:02.797
Eventually making your way to the same familiar antechamber

610
00:24:02.797 --> 00:24:05.341
you guys had rested when you first arrived here,

611
00:24:05.341 --> 00:24:06.973
though thankfully without having to deal

612
00:24:06.973 --> 00:24:09.837
with three moorbounders at your back.

613
00:24:09.837 --> 00:24:11.437
The same small fountain there,

614
00:24:11.437 --> 00:24:12.829
the the cups remain,

615
00:24:12.829 --> 00:24:15.469
the small seating arrangement.

616
00:24:15.469 --> 00:24:17.309
As you enter the chamber,

617
00:24:17.309 --> 00:24:18.700
the doors closed behind,

618
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.645
the guards leave it to you.

619
00:24:19.645 --> 00:24:22.634
One guard leaves through the other side of the chamber

620
00:24:22.634 --> 00:24:25.772
and you get a quick glimpse inside

621
00:24:25.772 --> 00:24:27.948
the central cathedral of the Bright Queen.

622
00:24:27.948 --> 00:24:31.550
That same glow diffused light throughout the chamber,

623
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.680
the same source orb hanging from the center above,

624
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.229
the white chains riding off of it, across,

625
00:24:37.229 --> 00:24:40.109
you can see that she's there on the Bright Queen's throne.

626
00:24:40.109 --> 00:24:42.011
The room, you get just a quick glance,

627
00:24:42.011 --> 00:24:43.053
they're in the mid-discussion.

628
00:24:43.053 --> 00:24:44.369
There is definitely--

629
00:24:44.369 --> 00:24:46.322
it is a busy evening.

630
00:24:46.322 --> 00:24:48.530
But you wait

631
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.411
and you wait.

632
00:24:50.411 --> 00:24:51.837
LAURA: Is the bright Queen in the same clothes

633
00:24:51.837 --> 00:24:53.452
or was she in different clothes?

634
00:24:53.452 --> 00:24:54.756
MATT: Hard to tell at this distance.

635
00:24:54.756 --> 00:24:56.925
You saw the the headpiece.

636
00:24:56.925 --> 00:24:58.508
TALIESIN: Are there snacks?

637
00:24:59.685 --> 00:25:01.890
We didn't have breakfast.

638
00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.990
We had breakfast, we didn't have lunch.

639
00:25:04.858 --> 00:25:07.933
TRAVIS: Can we tell how many are up on the platform with her?

640
00:25:07.933 --> 00:25:08.973
MATT: Well, it's closed already.

641
00:25:08.973 --> 00:25:09.949
You just got a quick glance.

642
00:25:09.949 --> 00:25:11.949
Roll a perception check.

643
00:25:13.453 --> 00:25:15.003
LAURA: Whoa.
SAM: Jesus.

644
00:25:15.003 --> 00:25:16.342
What the hell was that thing?

645
00:25:16.342 --> 00:25:17.675
TRAVIS: It's a gift. 15.

646
00:25:17.675 --> 00:25:18.508
MATT: 15.

647
00:25:19.369 --> 00:25:22.779
You saw the Bright Queen's right hand

648
00:25:22.779 --> 00:25:25.195
that you previously saw at her side

649
00:25:25.195 --> 00:25:26.623
was there to the left

650
00:25:26.623 --> 00:25:28.373
and you think you saw

651
00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:32.761
the Skysybil Abrianna Mirimm there as well,

652
00:25:32.761 --> 00:25:35.035
but that's all you got to see in that quick glance

653
00:25:35.035 --> 00:25:37.764
through the air before it closed.

654
00:25:37.764 --> 00:25:40.341
You're there for about 30 or so minutes

655
00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:43.579
before eventually the doors open once more.

656
00:25:43.579 --> 00:25:44.947
The guard says,

657
00:25:44.947 --> 00:25:48.651
"You are accepted into an audience with the bright Queen.

658
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:49.859
"This way."

659
00:25:49.859 --> 00:25:51.064
The chamber opens.

660
00:25:51.064 --> 00:25:55.708
As you guys walk into the interior,

661
00:25:55.708 --> 00:25:58.291
you can see already there is a--

662
00:25:59.562 --> 00:26:01.221
it is less--

663
00:26:04.009 --> 00:26:06.282
a small number of people in attendance here.

664
00:26:06.282 --> 00:26:07.898
Previously, you had all the raised platforms

665
00:26:07.898 --> 00:26:10.831
with the chairs of the different den heads

666
00:26:10.831 --> 00:26:11.664
that were there

667
00:26:11.664 --> 00:26:14.339
and the five chairs that were on the main central

668
00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:16.154
raised portion of the platform

669
00:26:16.154 --> 00:26:17.400
where the Bright Queen was.

670
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.166
Now, you can see maybe six individuals present.

671
00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:21.425
Two on one side,

672
00:26:21.425 --> 00:26:22.650
two on the other

673
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.432
and there is the Bright Queen

674
00:26:24.432 --> 00:26:26.515
and the right hand there.

675
00:26:27.474 --> 00:26:28.608
In a quick glance,

676
00:26:28.608 --> 00:26:29.568
you recognize some of them.

677
00:26:29.568 --> 00:26:32.430
These people were present when you first came through.

678
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.616
It's just a diminished amount.

679
00:26:33.616 --> 00:26:36.352
It seems like this isn't a formal gathering

680
00:26:36.352 --> 00:26:38.016
of all hands on-deck,

681
00:26:38.016 --> 00:26:39.248
more just general matters.

682
00:26:39.248 --> 00:26:43.408
You see Essek is present on the left side,

683
00:26:43.408 --> 00:26:46.239
Mirimm is in the right up in her chair,

684
00:26:46.239 --> 00:26:50.761
the the ancient goblin lore master of the Luxon.

685
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:53.611
The Bright Queen sits on her throne.

686
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:56.361
You can see now where she stands,

687
00:26:58.305 --> 00:27:01.579
the beacon statue that sits on the pedestal

688
00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:02.912
in front of her throne

689
00:27:02.912 --> 00:27:05.544
has a small light placed in it,

690
00:27:05.544 --> 00:27:08.312
probably signifying the return of the beacon itself,

691
00:27:08.312 --> 00:27:09.467
having that a warm glow

692
00:27:09.467 --> 00:27:10.859
that lights her from underneath

693
00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:13.355
where she sits, her arms out on the sides.

694
00:27:13.355 --> 00:27:14.396
LAURA: Is she in the same clothes

695
00:27:14.396 --> 00:27:16.235
or does she have different armor on?

696
00:27:16.235 --> 00:27:17.739
MATT: The outfit is slightly different.

697
00:27:17.739 --> 00:27:19.195
She still has the same mantle

698
00:27:19.195 --> 00:27:21.128
and light armor

699
00:27:21.128 --> 00:27:23.070
that's placed across the front,

700
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.147
but now she wears this long gown

701
00:27:25.147 --> 00:27:26.859
that has a diamond-esque rhinestones.

702
00:27:26.859 --> 00:27:27.692
As you get closer,

703
00:27:27.692 --> 00:27:29.388
there's a slight blue shimmy to them.

704
00:27:29.388 --> 00:27:30.909
LAURA: Blue shimmy?

705
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:31.819
MATT: There you go.

706
00:27:31.819 --> 00:27:33.569
LAURA: I really like that.

707
00:27:35.099 --> 00:27:37.467
MATT: The guard walks you up

708
00:27:37.467 --> 00:27:38.760
to that same center place

709
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.208
where you have both sides of the chair rows

710
00:27:41.208 --> 00:27:42.696
looking down onto you.

711
00:27:42.696 --> 00:27:44.212
The Bright Queen still sits,

712
00:27:44.212 --> 00:27:45.958
doesn't stand at your presence,

713
00:27:45.958 --> 00:27:49.708
as you all approach quietly and come to stop.

714
00:27:52.525 --> 00:27:57.189
"I have been told that you have important business

715
00:27:57.189 --> 00:27:59.056
"and had to see me.

716
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.608
"Well, you've proven helpful before

717
00:28:03.608 --> 00:28:07.798
"so you have my attention.

718
00:28:07.798 --> 00:28:10.931
"What is this business that was so important?"

719
00:28:11.864 --> 00:28:13.688
TALIESIN: Your highness, is this as private an audience

720
00:28:13.688 --> 00:28:14.855
as we can get?

721
00:28:15.752 --> 00:28:18.344
MATT: "There is no more private place in this city."

722
00:28:18.344 --> 00:28:19.516
TALIESIN: Good.

723
00:28:19.516 --> 00:28:20.816
SAM: Yasha, take it away.

724
00:28:21.782 --> 00:28:23.998
(laughter)

725
00:28:26.898 --> 00:28:31.192
ASHLEY: We went to go see Professor Waccoh

726
00:28:31.192 --> 00:28:35.784
and she sent us to a place and found a rift,

727
00:28:35.784 --> 00:28:38.040
we found a disk and we found a piece of fabric.

728
00:28:38.907 --> 00:28:39.740
LAURA: Yes.

729
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.277
The rift, you know, was--

730
00:28:42.277 --> 00:28:44.344
Okay. Basically, we have word

731
00:28:44.344 --> 00:28:46.328
that there's going to be a big attack

732
00:28:46.328 --> 00:28:49.729
and we know where it's going to be.

733
00:28:49.729 --> 00:28:52.231
We found out because we found this rift that was broken

734
00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:54.440
and then we broke it, we ended the rift.

735
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.472
Then we scryed on this little piece of fabric

736
00:28:56.472 --> 00:28:57.496
that was stuck to it, right?

737
00:28:57.496 --> 00:28:59.125
Then we found out there was this dude

738
00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:01.128
and he's been doing it in a bunch of other places

739
00:29:01.128 --> 00:29:01.961
and then I scryed--

740
00:29:01.961 --> 00:29:03.487
SAM: Maybe we should back up a little bit back.

741
00:29:03.487 --> 00:29:06.182
So we met at like a circus.

742
00:29:06.182 --> 00:29:07.656
MATT: Little gruff goblin--

743
00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:11.748
(laughter)

744
00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:15.750
SAM: It was a crazy night.

745
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.470
After a while yada yada--

746
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.134
MARISHA: I think we should mention the portal.

747
00:29:20.134 --> 00:29:21.894
MATT: The Bright Queen puts her hand up.

748
00:29:21.894 --> 00:29:25.061
You could hear Mirimm chuckle.

749
00:29:26.863 --> 00:29:29.071
"Time is precious in this conflict.

750
00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:34.326
"I would ask: succinctly, what you have found

751
00:29:34.326 --> 00:29:36.070
"and why it is important to us?"

752
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.878
LAURA: You should just say what we wrote down.

753
00:29:37.878 --> 00:29:38.961
TRAVIS: There is...

754
00:29:40.534 --> 00:29:42.118
MARISHA: We have very strong reason to believe

755
00:29:42.118 --> 00:29:46.054
that there is going to be incursion on Ashguard Garrison.

756
00:29:46.054 --> 00:29:47.300
LAURA: That one.

757
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.350
ASHLEY: I was getting there, I just--

758
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.350
MATT: "From whom?"

759
00:29:52.127 --> 00:29:57.127
MARISHA: Well, with the aforementioned piece of fabric

760
00:29:57.636 --> 00:30:02.594
that we found attached to this rift breaking device,

761
00:30:02.594 --> 00:30:04.337
Jester with her--
LAURA: I scryed.

762
00:30:04.337 --> 00:30:06.761
MARISHA: Jester scryed

763
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:08.899
and he appeared to be some sort of agent

764
00:30:08.899 --> 00:30:10.468
working for King Dwendal.

765
00:30:10.468 --> 00:30:12.458
LAURA: He had a Zemnian accent, right?

766
00:30:12.458 --> 00:30:14.625
MARISHA: Clearly from the Empire.

767
00:30:15.508 --> 00:30:18.276
We happened to peek in

768
00:30:18.276 --> 00:30:23.092
on a very fervored and intense meeting

769
00:30:24.926 --> 00:30:26.868
on attacks.

770
00:30:26.868 --> 00:30:27.701
LAURA: He was like meeting

771
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:30.836
with, like, the king or something.

772
00:30:30.836 --> 00:30:32.241
Everyone was saying your highness.

773
00:30:32.241 --> 00:30:33.074
SAM: My liege.

774
00:30:33.074 --> 00:30:34.824
LAURA: My liege, my liege.

775
00:30:35.748 --> 00:30:40.748
MARISHA: From what we heard, they are very upset

776
00:30:40.947 --> 00:30:43.075
at losing Ashguard Garrison

777
00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:45.058
as you can imagine.

778
00:30:45.058 --> 00:30:48.276
I imagine they'd be pulling out all the stops.

779
00:30:48.276 --> 00:30:50.628
They are also releasing troops and guards

780
00:30:50.628 --> 00:30:54.484
into the Ashguard Keep mountains,

781
00:30:54.484 --> 00:30:57.204
the Ash-Ashkeep Mountains.

782
00:30:57.204 --> 00:30:58.963
MATT: Ashkeeper.

783
00:30:58.963 --> 00:31:00.419
MARISHA: The Ashkeeper Mountains.

784
00:31:00.419 --> 00:31:02.659
I said correctly in game.

785
00:31:02.659 --> 00:31:03.984
MATT: There you go.

786
00:31:03.984 --> 00:31:05.617
(laughter)

787
00:31:05.617 --> 00:31:07.942
LAURA: Also, also, also,

788
00:31:07.942 --> 00:31:09.107
should we tell her about that--

789
00:31:09.107 --> 00:31:10.035
SAM: Overcrow.

790
00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:11.301
LAURA: So he's coming,

791
00:31:11.301 --> 00:31:13.827
I heard him say he was going to be here tomorrow night.

792
00:31:13.827 --> 00:31:14.883
He's going to be at the Overcrow.

793
00:31:14.883 --> 00:31:16.816
SAM: The Overcrow Apothecary,

794
00:31:16.816 --> 00:31:18.221
which we pre-scouted

795
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:22.127
just to make sure it wasn't a den of whatever.

796
00:31:22.127 --> 00:31:23.249
And it is.

797
00:31:23.249 --> 00:31:25.360
It's a home of smuggling

798
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.329
and an invisible bugbear

799
00:31:27.329 --> 00:31:29.201
and all sorts of nastiness.

800
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:30.432
TRAVIS: We didn't want to waste your time.

801
00:31:30.432 --> 00:31:32.850
We thought it was important to vet--

802
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:37.121
TALIESIN: This was all just conjecture until a few hours ago.

803
00:31:37.121 --> 00:31:39.249
MATT: "Do you recall any discussion

804
00:31:39.249 --> 00:31:42.889
"of the scope of this attack on the Ashguard?"

805
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:43.722
MARISHA: Yes.

806
00:31:45.743 --> 00:31:47.377
The scope was,

807
00:31:47.377 --> 00:31:48.529
hang on let me just pull out--

808
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:50.276
I like to take notes.

809
00:31:50.276 --> 00:31:51.825
LAURA: We told her all about it and she wrote it down.

810
00:31:51.825 --> 00:31:52.658
SAM: Yes, no.

811
00:31:52.658 --> 00:31:54.671
They said that they were going to be using Scourgers.

812
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:57.730
MARISHA: They are going to be mobilizing three legions,

813
00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.785
I don't know how many that employs.

814
00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:01.968
MATT: You see a few faces look around

815
00:32:01.968 --> 00:32:03.421
a little bit surprised.

816
00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:06.988
MARISHA: As well as bringing in the Righteous Brand

817
00:32:06.988 --> 00:32:10.368
as scouts into the Ashkeeper Peaks

818
00:32:10.368 --> 00:32:14.368
and they're looking at bringing in the Scourgers.

819
00:32:15.272 --> 00:32:17.809
TRAVIS: Those fucking dope note skills, player!

820
00:32:17.809 --> 00:32:19.697
MARISHA: On top of that, we have reason--

821
00:32:19.697 --> 00:32:21.329
ASHLEY: They said they were using them as a distraction.

822
00:32:21.329 --> 00:32:23.745
MARISHA: Yes.
SAM: The Scourgers were being--?

823
00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:24.578
ASHLEY: Yeah.

824
00:32:24.578 --> 00:32:27.198
MARISHA: If I had to guess, your highness,

825
00:32:27.198 --> 00:32:31.281
the man that we were able to spy on is a Scourger.

826
00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:36.784
If he is able to come this far across the border,

827
00:32:36.784 --> 00:32:40.161
I have reason to believe it's by magical means.

828
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:42.712
TALIESIN: Possibly responsible for these devices.

829
00:32:42.712 --> 00:32:45.037
LIAM: Yes, it's been a series of them

830
00:32:45.037 --> 00:32:47.319
that have been planted throughout your kingdom.

831
00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:48.925
LAURA: We've destroyed three of them.

832
00:32:48.925 --> 00:32:51.997
MATT: "This device you speak of is similar to the one

833
00:32:51.997 --> 00:32:53.869
"that you found in Asarius?"

834
00:32:53.869 --> 00:32:55.202
TRAVIS: Exactly right.

835
00:32:58.293 --> 00:33:02.221
MARISHA: Oh, with that also,

836
00:33:02.221 --> 00:33:06.053
we've heard that with such a massive movement

837
00:33:06.053 --> 00:33:07.357
of the soldiers

838
00:33:07.357 --> 00:33:08.845
that the Empire has reached out

839
00:33:08.845 --> 00:33:12.770
to the Gold Chain Mercenaries from Nicodranas

840
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.569
to help guard the mainlands.

841
00:33:14.569 --> 00:33:17.625
LAURA: Really expensive and really powerful.

842
00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:19.453
Fjord knows, he told me.

843
00:33:19.453 --> 00:33:20.617
TRAVIS: Yep.

844
00:33:20.617 --> 00:33:22.708
MATT: The Bright Queen looks to--

845
00:33:22.708 --> 00:33:24.100
SAM: Thanks Fjord.

846
00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.166
MATT: --her right hand,

847
00:33:26.166 --> 00:33:29.512
where she sits next to the Bright Queen and goes,

848
00:33:29.512 --> 00:33:31.516
"Perhaps we should put some guard into the south

849
00:33:31.516 --> 00:33:34.382
"on the Lucidian Ocean.

850
00:33:37.894 --> 00:33:39.277
"And you can--"

851
00:33:39.277 --> 00:33:40.634
LAURA: This is what he looks like.

852
00:33:40.634 --> 00:33:42.989
I pull out my sketch drawing of him.

853
00:33:42.989 --> 00:33:44.538
If, you know, if you've seen him and you go,

854
00:33:44.538 --> 00:33:46.461
like, "Oh my gosh, he was, like, talking to me

855
00:33:46.461 --> 00:33:47.961
"and I didn't know."

856
00:33:50.109 --> 00:33:52.692
MATT: She looks over towards Essek.

857
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:55.725
"They've been assigned as your wards

858
00:33:55.725 --> 00:33:58.557
"and do you trust in this, yes?

859
00:33:58.557 --> 00:34:00.573
"You believe them?"

860
00:34:00.573 --> 00:34:03.500
Essek's sitting there in the chair,

861
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.116
you can see the hands just barely crossed

862
00:34:05.116 --> 00:34:07.699
poking through the cloak. Goes,

863
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:10.301
"I trust them."

864
00:34:11.773 --> 00:34:13.517
TRAVIS: 'Cause he's been checking on that shit.

865
00:34:13.517 --> 00:34:14.434
LAURA: Probably.

866
00:34:15.534 --> 00:34:17.468
MATT: She gives a nod.

867
00:34:17.468 --> 00:34:20.135
"Well, we shall plan accordingly.

868
00:34:22.128 --> 00:34:22.991
"They will rue the day

869
00:34:22.991 --> 00:34:26.241
"they tried to assail us on their terms."

870
00:34:27.324 --> 00:34:29.574
MARISHA: May I be so humble to ask

871
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:33.486
what that plan might include?

872
00:34:34.652 --> 00:34:36.655
MATT: "That is not of your concern,

873
00:34:36.655 --> 00:34:39.470
"but we appreciate your diligence

874
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:41.567
"in offering us this information."

875
00:34:41.567 --> 00:34:44.900
MARISHA: If I may offer one more word, my lady?

876
00:34:50.703 --> 00:34:53.194
Being of the Empire,

877
00:34:53.194 --> 00:34:56.028
what we can for sure tell you is that

878
00:34:56.028 --> 00:35:00.808
they do not take kindly to being bested or embarrassed

879
00:35:00.808 --> 00:35:02.865
and they will retaliate

880
00:35:02.865 --> 00:35:04.972
with the full force

881
00:35:04.972 --> 00:35:08.555
of everything they've been working towards.

882
00:35:09.676 --> 00:35:11.737
MATT: "If I am correct in my beliefs,

883
00:35:11.737 --> 00:35:15.591
"this is retaliation for our retaliation."

884
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:18.865
MARISHA: Yes, it's a lot of retaliation.

885
00:35:18.865 --> 00:35:22.156
MATT: "This will continue until one side cannot retaliate

886
00:35:22.156 --> 00:35:26.156
"and we hope with a swift enough and well-planned

887
00:35:29.051 --> 00:35:32.051
"plot laid out with this information,

888
00:35:33.224 --> 00:35:34.177
"perhaps we can keep them

889
00:35:34.177 --> 00:35:37.799
"from being able to retaliate for some time."

890
00:35:37.799 --> 00:35:42.707
MARISHA: I am no war strategist or battle advisor,

891
00:35:44.717 --> 00:35:47.993
but if you want to live for this vendetta

892
00:35:47.993 --> 00:35:50.076
and retaliate another day

893
00:35:52.303 --> 00:35:55.629
I would highly consider evacuating your troops

894
00:35:55.629 --> 00:35:57.573
from Ashguard Garrison

895
00:35:57.573 --> 00:36:00.323
and defending amongst the border.

896
00:36:01.809 --> 00:36:05.309
MATT: "Trust that we do have military advisors.

897
00:36:06.473 --> 00:36:09.735
"We have individuals who have dedicated

898
00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:13.055
"their entire existence and multiple lives

899
00:36:13.055 --> 00:36:16.663
"to being tacticians on the battlefield."

900
00:36:16.663 --> 00:36:17.754
MARISHA: Of course.

901
00:36:17.754 --> 00:36:20.837
MATT: "We have this handled, but thank you.

902
00:36:22.067 --> 00:36:23.984
"You mentioned Scourgers.

903
00:36:25.952 --> 00:36:29.326
"What can you tell me about these Scourgers?"

904
00:36:29.326 --> 00:36:30.651
SAM: Caleb.

905
00:36:30.651 --> 00:36:31.992
LAURA: I don't, I don't--

906
00:36:31.992 --> 00:36:33.344
SAM: Caleb might now.

907
00:36:33.344 --> 00:36:35.443
Caleb will know.

908
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:38.135
MATT: "What do you know of these Scourgers?"

909
00:36:38.135 --> 00:36:40.052
LIAM: I know a fair amount.

910
00:36:43.116 --> 00:36:46.583
Years ago, I was training to be one.

911
00:36:48.974 --> 00:36:52.331
I-I made it quite far in the process

912
00:36:52.331 --> 00:36:55.148
before I was cast out.

913
00:36:57.126 --> 00:36:59.993
B-but I know things, and

914
00:37:01.983 --> 00:37:03.671
I know I'm retreading past ground,

915
00:37:03.671 --> 00:37:07.633
but I hope that as you protect your people and your kingdom

916
00:37:07.633 --> 00:37:11.550
you will consider instead of utter destruction,

917
00:37:13.406 --> 00:37:16.253
there are people on the other side of those mountains

918
00:37:16.253 --> 00:37:20.794
who are not happy with the ones running the show.

919
00:37:22.452 --> 00:37:23.285
Use us.

920
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.342
Use us for your ends.

921
00:37:26.342 --> 00:37:29.173
Use us to find this other missing relic.

922
00:37:29.173 --> 00:37:31.090
Use us and our contacts

923
00:37:33.791 --> 00:37:37.858
to help supplant to the Cerberus.

924
00:37:40.915 --> 00:37:44.262
MARISHA: We can help you break the cycle.

925
00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:46.595
MATT: "The cycle cannot be broken

926
00:37:47.585 --> 00:37:50.577
"until there is nothing living.

927
00:37:50.577 --> 00:37:54.077
"All we can do is our best to keep it slow."

928
00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:57.494
LAURA: Why can't the cycle be broken?

929
00:37:57.494 --> 00:38:00.161
MATT: "Because life is pain for many.

930
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:02.727
"Jealousy, strife.

931
00:38:03.883 --> 00:38:05.907
"Some need to conquer.

932
00:38:05.907 --> 00:38:07.282
"There will always be those

00:38:07.282 --> 00:38:11.151
"that will do whatever it takes to get one over

934
00:38:11.151 --> 00:38:15.657
"the man or woman or otherwise to their left and right."

935
00:38:15.657 --> 00:38:19.740
TALIESIN: Talking about yourself or the Empire right now?

936
00:38:20.814 --> 00:38:24.977
MATT: "I'm talking about anything that draws breath.

937
00:38:24.977 --> 00:38:29.384
"And it is our duty to acknowledge that

938
00:38:29.384 --> 00:38:34.376
"and try to keep those base designs at bay.

939
00:38:35.967 --> 00:38:38.120
"But one cannot bow down

"when others do not show that same will of understanding

941
00:38:42.043 --> 00:38:45.190
"or else they will lie slaughtered."

942
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.477
LIAM: My lady,

943
00:38:46.477 --> 00:38:51.009
what have you to lose by using us as a tool

944
00:38:51.009 --> 00:38:52.755
to carve out the rotten--

945
00:38:52.755 --> 00:38:55.971
MATT: "I have not spoken

946
00:38:55.971 --> 00:39:00.971
"on whether or not I choose to utilize what you bring yet.

947
00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:02.755
LIAM: (whispered) Apologies.

948
00:39:02.755 --> 00:39:06.099
MATT: "These Scourgers once more, what are they?

949
00:39:06.099 --> 00:39:06.932
"Warriors?"

950
00:39:06.932 --> 00:39:08.057
LIAM: Mages.

951
00:39:09.285 --> 00:39:12.452
MATT: "Artillery, assassins, what are they?"

952
00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:20.319
LIAM: They are both, hidden spies and destroyers.

953
00:39:21.763 --> 00:39:22.846
Executioners.

954
00:39:25.371 --> 00:39:29.788
MATT: "I think I begin to see the pattern of their design.

SAM: There's a rendezvous--

964
00:40:03.411 --> 00:40:04.681
LAURA: Tomorrow night.

965
00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:06.719
SAM: At this apothecary.

966
00:40:06.719 --> 00:40:07.969
LAURA: The Overcrow.

967
00:40:09.134 --> 00:40:10.301
MATT: "See to this,

968
00:40:12.668 --> 00:40:14.889
"find and bring me this individual."

969
00:40:16.139 --> 00:40:18.209
LAURA: Yeah, we can totally do that.

970
00:40:18.209 --> 00:40:19.709
That's no problem.

971
00:40:23.316 --> 00:40:26.039
MATT: "Do you not believe you're capable?"

972
00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:30.090
LAURA: Your highness, of course I believe we are capable.

973
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.426
We're super strong.

974
00:40:31.426 --> 00:40:32.697
MATT: "We have very capable--

975
00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:34.295
"if there is any doubt,

976
00:40:34.295 --> 00:40:35.583
"we can have others--"

977
00:40:35.583 --> 00:40:36.780
LIAM: There is no doubt.

978
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.783
MARISHA: No, we got this.

979
00:40:37.783 --> 00:40:39.789
MATT: Essek puts his hand--

980
00:40:39.789 --> 00:40:42.110
LAURA: Did you want to come, Essek?

981
00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.487
on attacks. "I have my own business to attend to,

982
00:40:44.487 --> 00:40:46.829
"but I will vouch for their capabilities

983
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:50.794
"and my tutelage."

984
00:40:53.322 --> 00:40:56.080
The Bright Queen gives him a look and goes,

985
00:40:58.479 --> 00:41:00.342
"If this is true,

986
00:41:00.342 --> 00:41:03.425
"you know this man of which you have seen.

"Bring him to me, preferably alive.

"Because if he is as connected as you say,

"we have ways of pulling that information from him.

"And that information could bring this war to an end

"far sooner than any of us had hoped.

00:41:26.998 --> 00:41:28.751
"Can you do this?"

993
00:41:28.751 --> 00:41:30.000
SAM: Yeah.

994
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.833
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

995
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.048
MATT: "Then go.

996
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:40.280
"The Luxon's light upon you."

997
00:41:43.499 --> 00:41:45.916
SAM: Light upon you as well.

998
00:41:48.117 --> 00:41:51.367
LAURA: I really like your dress today.

999
00:41:51.367 --> 00:41:52.200
Okay, bye.

1000
00:41:53.127 --> 00:41:55.101
SAM: I guess we just leave.

1001
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:57.368
LAURA: Are we allowed-- should we back away?

1002
00:41:57.368 --> 00:41:58.600
SAM: We're going to just back away, really awkward.

1003
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.448
MATT: She puts her hand and gives a--

1004
00:42:00.448 --> 00:42:01.281
not a shooing motion,

1005
00:42:01.281 --> 00:42:03.537
but a very well you may leave.

1006
00:42:03.537 --> 00:42:05.112
SAM: Keep backing away.

1007
00:42:05.112 --> 00:42:06.828
Feel where the wall is.

1008
00:42:06.828 --> 00:42:08.486
MATT: Just slowly exit.

1009
00:42:08.486 --> 00:42:10.186
MARISHA: Don't make eye contact.

1010
00:42:10.186 --> 00:42:11.817
TRAVIS: There's no wall behind us.

1011
00:42:11.817 --> 00:42:13.067
LAURA: Yeah, I know.

1012
00:42:13.067 --> 00:42:15.067
We fall down the stairs.

1013
00:42:18.312 --> 00:42:19.421
MATT: As you guys exit out,

1014
00:42:19.421 --> 00:42:21.955
the guard escort leads you back

1015
00:42:21.955 --> 00:42:24.771
towards the front of the Lucid Bastion

1016
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:26.690
and eventually left out

1017
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:31.107
towards the edge of the Firmaments once more.

1018
00:42:31.107 --> 00:42:33.293
SAM: I think if we get close enough to her

1019
00:42:33.293 --> 00:42:35.767
she will let you tattoo her.

1020
00:42:35.767 --> 00:42:36.600
LAURA: You think, you think?
SAM: I think so.

1021
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.095
LAURA: Man, how cool would that be?

1022
00:42:38.095 --> 00:42:40.136
SAM: Well, bodies don't really matter to them, right?

1023
00:42:40.136 --> 00:42:42.263
Don't they recycle them every so often?

1024
00:42:42.263 --> 00:42:43.096
LAURA: I think so.

1025
00:42:43.096 --> 00:42:44.765
SAM: Yeah, so why not just to get it tatted up?

1026
00:42:44.765 --> 00:42:47.106
LAURA: Maybe she's like, "Oh man two lives ago,

1027
00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:48.215
"I had this really cool tattoo.

1028
00:42:48.215 --> 00:42:49.996
"Could you recreate it or something?"

1029
00:42:49.996 --> 00:42:51.308
That would be awesome.

1030
00:42:51.308 --> 00:42:53.842
LIAM: We need to do this perfectly.

1031
00:42:53.842 --> 00:42:55.061
MARISHA: Which part?

1032
00:42:55.061 --> 00:42:56.144
All of it?

1033
00:42:56.144 --> 00:42:57.747
LIAM: Yeah, but tomorrow--

1034
00:42:57.747 --> 00:42:58.709
MARISHA: What did we just do?

1035
00:42:58.709 --> 00:42:59.763
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm not sure.

1036
00:42:59.763 --> 00:43:01.064
LAURA: We just totally committed ourselves

1037
00:43:01.064 --> 00:43:03.184
to Xhorhas is all.

1038
00:43:03.184 --> 00:43:05.549
TRAVIS: That didn't go the way I hoped it would have.

1039
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:08.073
SAM: How did you think it was, yeah?

1040
00:43:08.073 --> 00:43:09.678
TRAVIS: I would hope there would be

1041
00:43:09.678 --> 00:43:12.619
more of an audience for reason.

1042
00:43:12.619 --> 00:43:13.904
I mean it in a fight,

1043
00:43:13.904 --> 00:43:15.979
if you can take away the weapons of both sides,

1044
00:43:15.979 --> 00:43:17.667
you are forced to use alternate means

1045
00:43:17.667 --> 00:43:19.589
to resolve your differences.

1046
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:21.982
The Cerberus Assembly is a weapon.

1047
00:43:21.982 --> 00:43:23.284
I would prefer to attack that

1048
00:43:23.284 --> 00:43:25.033
than to wipe a nation of its people.

1049
00:43:25.033 --> 00:43:26.699
LIAM: Correct, I agree.

1050
00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:29.057
LAURA: Was she saying she's going to kill everybody

1051
00:43:29.057 --> 00:43:30.257
in the Empire?

1052
00:43:30.257 --> 00:43:32.384
TRAVIS: She's saying until no one else draws breath.

1053
00:43:32.384 --> 00:43:33.422
LIAM: She seems very bloodthirsty.

1054
00:43:33.422 --> 00:43:36.322
MARISHA: And mentioned them not

1055
00:43:36.322 --> 00:43:40.269
respecting the life.

1056
00:43:40.269 --> 00:43:42.606
What did she meant by that?

1057
00:43:42.606 --> 00:43:46.555
TRAVIS: Very wide net she's casting.
LAURA: If everybody in the Empire

1058
00:43:46.555 --> 00:43:49.632
like bends the knee?

1059
00:43:49.632 --> 00:43:50.956
That's what they say, right?

1060
00:43:50.956 --> 00:43:52.123
SAM: I think I've heard that recently.

1061
00:43:52.123 --> 00:43:53.723
LAURA: Yeah. What if they all do that

1062
00:43:53.723 --> 00:43:55.453
and then they're part of Xhorhas

1063
00:43:55.453 --> 00:43:57.148
and then she doesn't have to kill them?

1064
00:43:57.148 --> 00:43:59.895
Then it's all one happy country.

1065
00:43:59.895 --> 00:44:01.287
MARISHA: It felt like that's what she was alluding to,

1066
00:44:01.287 --> 00:44:03.927
but not necessarily bending the knee to her,

1067
00:44:03.927 --> 00:44:07.793
bending the knee to their beliefs,

1068
00:44:08.861 --> 00:44:12.950
their Luxon, is what it felt like.

1069
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.475
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1070
00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.691
MARISHA: You know, if they believe in this cycle,

1071
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:22.442
they believe in their intrinsic attachment

1072
00:44:22.442 --> 00:44:26.109
to the dodecahedrons,

1073
00:44:27.089 --> 00:44:29.271
I could only imagine they would only benefit

1074
00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:33.355
from having more people attached to that, right?

1075
00:44:33.355 --> 00:44:35.501
TRAVIS: Well, we're just guessing at this point.

1076
00:44:35.501 --> 00:44:36.628
I mean, the information's out there.

1077
00:44:36.628 --> 00:44:38.107
We can't take it back.

1078
00:44:38.107 --> 00:44:40.223
LIAM: We're also not going to stop these people

1079
00:44:40.223 --> 00:44:42.366
from trying to kill each other.

1080
00:44:42.366 --> 00:44:45.393
We need to swim upstream together,

1081
00:44:45.393 --> 00:44:48.084
we need to get through this, we need to earn their trust.

1082
00:44:48.084 --> 00:44:51.289
I know that we'll feel awful to do what we are doing,

1083
00:44:51.289 --> 00:44:52.497
one moment please.

1084
00:44:52.497 --> 00:44:54.364
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

1085
00:44:56.873 --> 00:44:58.201
I thought you had finished your point.

1086
00:44:58.201 --> 00:44:59.851
LIAM: I hadn't.

1087
00:45:03.391 --> 00:45:06.453
I want to do things at home, Beauregard,

1088
00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:07.318
and that's not going to happen

1089
00:45:07.318 --> 00:45:11.786
unless we completely earn her trust.

1090
00:45:11.786 --> 00:45:12.862
TRAVIS: You mean back in the Empire?

1091
00:45:12.862 --> 00:45:13.702
LIAM: Yeah.

1092
00:45:13.702 --> 00:45:17.920
And for that we need to do a good job.

1093
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.467
TRAVIS: Do you think she would give us

1094
00:45:20.467 --> 00:45:22.752
a wide enough berth to head back to the Empire?

1095
00:45:22.752 --> 00:45:25.252
I'm starting to think, since we seem to be on the same page,

1096
00:45:25.252 --> 00:45:26.977
we might just have to do it ourselves.

1097
00:45:26.977 --> 00:45:28.649
LAURA: Yeah, we could go whenever we want to,

1098
00:45:28.649 --> 00:45:30.833
now that Caleb has that awesome thingie.

1099
00:45:30.833 --> 00:45:33.624
TALIESIN: I think that, perhaps,

1100
00:45:35.508 --> 00:45:36.640
there's a course of action

1101
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.590
that is in front of us right now

1102
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.239
and it seems to be the right one.

1103
00:45:40.239 --> 00:45:41.919
If we're only taking into account

1104
00:45:41.919 --> 00:45:45.422
what what we can see and what's in front of us

1105
00:45:45.422 --> 00:45:46.933
and I think we have to keep

1106
00:45:46.933 --> 00:45:49.266
abiding by that for a while.

1107
00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.288
LIAM: I think rather than piss around

1108
00:45:53.288 --> 00:45:56.033
and have her just sweep us aside,

1109
00:45:56.033 --> 00:45:58.798
we show our real capability

1110
00:45:58.798 --> 00:46:01.925
and then work with her, work with them,

1111
00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.930
to send us in, working conjunction with them,

1112
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:07.185
and maybe some of our intentions are parallel

1113
00:46:07.185 --> 00:46:11.860
and some are not, but we know what we are doing.

1114
00:46:13.293 --> 00:46:14.635
She will use us,

1115
00:46:14.635 --> 00:46:16.426
we will use them.

1116
00:46:16.426 --> 00:46:19.260
LAURA: We're still standing on the street.

1117
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.562
TALIESIN: I assume we're walking towards--

1118
00:46:20.562 --> 00:46:23.190
MARISHA: They're walking and whispering.

1119
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:26.146
TALIESIN: As long as we serve our interests.

1120
00:46:26.146 --> 00:46:28.450
MARISHA: I have no doubt we can capture this guy

1121
00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:33.450
and complete that and do a fucking stellar job

1122
00:46:33.767 --> 00:46:35.174
because we're awesome.

1123
00:46:35.174 --> 00:46:36.092
LAURA: We are really powerful.

1124
00:46:36.092 --> 00:46:37.887
MARISHA: We're really great.

1125
00:46:37.887 --> 00:46:40.351
TALIESIN: Doing it will save lives.

1126
00:46:40.351 --> 00:46:42.516
LAURA: He's probably really powerful, too.

1127
00:46:42.516 --> 00:46:46.792
SAM: Yeah, he did open up rifts to a different dimension.

1128
00:46:46.792 --> 00:46:49.290
LAURA: Well, he did that with a thing.

1129
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:51.050
SAM: He still made the thing, though.

1130
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:51.883
LAURA: How do you know?

1131
00:46:51.883 --> 00:46:52.716
Maybe somebody gave it to him.

1132
00:46:52.716 --> 00:46:53.973
Maybe he's just like this dude

1133
00:46:53.973 --> 00:46:55.764
that walks around and puts down on the ground.

1134
00:46:55.764 --> 00:46:56.830
TALIESIN: One way to find out.

1135
00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:58.074
SAM: Like a delivery boy?

1136
00:46:58.074 --> 00:46:59.749
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah, you're right.

1137
00:46:59.749 --> 00:47:01.644
LIAM: The Empire is also not lily-white.

1138
00:47:01.644 --> 00:47:05.697
I was trained to kill people at a word

1139
00:47:05.697 --> 00:47:08.272
that I did not ultimately know.

1140
00:47:09.532 --> 00:47:10.857
Their guilt.

1141
00:47:12.594 --> 00:47:14.653
LAURA: Bad people in charge,

1142
00:47:14.653 --> 00:47:16.871
normal people on the streets.

1143
00:47:16.871 --> 00:47:19.335
SAM: Maybe we should just be in charge.

1144
00:47:19.335 --> 00:47:20.811
LAURA: Yeah!

1145
00:47:20.811 --> 00:47:22.274
That's awesome!

1146
00:47:22.274 --> 00:47:23.893
Let's help her tear down the Empire

1147
00:47:23.893 --> 00:47:25.580
and as a reward--

1148
00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.709
SAM: Stab her in the neck,

1149
00:47:26.709 --> 00:47:27.800
take over the kingdom.

1150
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.765
LAURA: That's not was I was going to say.

1151
00:47:28.765 --> 00:47:29.666
SAM: Oh, I was--

1152
00:47:29.666 --> 00:47:31.374
LAURA: Leave her in Xhorhas and then

1153
00:47:31.374 --> 00:47:32.882
she can give us the Empire

1154
00:47:32.882 --> 00:47:34.766
and we'll be like, "We will totally serve you!"

1155
00:47:34.766 --> 00:47:36.813
and then we'll be the kings and queens over there

1156
00:47:36.813 --> 00:47:38.312
that like are her friends.

1157
00:47:38.312 --> 00:47:39.245
SAM: Okay, okay.

1158
00:47:39.245 --> 00:47:40.962
LAURA: Cycle broken.

1159
00:47:42.661 --> 00:47:43.494
TALIESIN: Well--

1160
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.811
TRAVIS: Uh...

1161
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:48.366
TALIESIN: In all seriousness--

1162
00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:50.544
SAM: In all seriousness, that could happen!

1163
00:47:50.544 --> 00:47:51.827
LAURA: Yeah!

1164
00:47:51.827 --> 00:47:53.219
LIAM: I have a question.

1165
00:47:53.219 --> 00:47:54.821
MARISHA: Yeah?

1166
00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:57.619
LIAM: Do you want to get in touch with your mentor

1167
00:47:57.619 --> 00:48:00.202
before tomorrow night or after?

1168
00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.001
MARISHA: Uh...

1169
00:48:09.481 --> 00:48:10.326
SAM: I would suggest before,

1170
00:48:10.326 --> 00:48:13.977
just in case she is possibly going to meet--

1171
00:48:13.977 --> 00:48:16.134
MARISHA: I am terrified I'm going to run into this bitch

1172
00:48:16.134 --> 00:48:17.525
in an elevator

1173
00:48:17.525 --> 00:48:19.179
and it's going to be so fucking awkward.

1174
00:48:19.179 --> 00:48:20.639
TRAVIS: That's going to be the most dope

1175
00:48:20.639 --> 00:48:23.739
John Wick Four scene ever. I hope that shit happens.

1176
00:48:23.739 --> 00:48:25.909
(laughter)

1177
00:48:25.909 --> 00:48:27.651
I am down for that.

1178
00:48:27.651 --> 00:48:30.115
Do we have elevators in this game?

1179
00:48:30.115 --> 00:48:32.611
MATT: I'll make one just for that.

1180
00:48:32.611 --> 00:48:34.811
TRAVIS: Ding! (punches)

1181
00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:36.485
LAURA: What if she's working with the blonde guy?

1182
00:48:36.485 --> 00:48:38.551
MARISHA: I've thought about it!

1183
00:48:38.551 --> 00:48:40.992
LAURA: What if she's going to be at the Overcrow tomorrow?

1184
00:48:40.992 --> 00:48:42.013
MARISHA: What if she kills me?

1185
00:48:42.013 --> 00:48:43.315
What if she finds out?

1186
00:48:43.315 --> 00:48:44.148
LAURA: She's not going to kill you.

1187
00:48:44.148 --> 00:48:46.089
You're so powerful and strong.

1188
00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:49.141
TRAVIS: Also, if I may,

1189
00:48:49.141 --> 00:48:50.848
we know the skeletons

1190
00:48:50.848 --> 00:48:53.505
that are in the closet of the Empire, right?

1191
00:48:53.505 --> 00:48:55.741
We assume that we're on the side of goodness

1192
00:48:55.741 --> 00:48:59.525
and we're trying to stop the evil from being perpetuated

1193
00:48:59.525 --> 00:49:01.541
by everything we've heard.
LIAM: No.

1194
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:03.256
TRAVIS: We don't know this side.

1195
00:49:03.256 --> 00:49:05.377
LAURA: No, they could totally.

1196
00:49:05.377 --> 00:49:08.937
TRAVIS: Okay, just making sure we're all on the same page.

1197
00:49:08.937 --> 00:49:11.105
TALIESIN: I'm not here just to serve a monarchy

1198
00:49:11.105 --> 00:49:12.716
or anything like that.

1199
00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:13.552
I'm just here to--

1200
00:49:13.552 --> 00:49:16.245
TRAVIS: That was very impassioned dialogue.

1201
00:49:16.245 --> 00:49:19.078
That's going to be hard to walk back.

1202
00:49:20.686 --> 00:49:23.426
MARISHA: You guys know, so,

1203
00:49:23.426 --> 00:49:27.920
when I was working at the winery with my dad

1204
00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.885
or even on the boat

1205
00:49:29.885 --> 00:49:32.505
and when you're building a barrel

1206
00:49:32.505 --> 00:49:36.361
you have to put the barrel straps

1207
00:49:36.361 --> 00:49:39.789
on one side at a time--

1208
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:40.622
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1209
00:49:40.622 --> 00:49:42.997
MARISHA: -- because if you do one side

1210
00:49:42.997 --> 00:49:46.411
in order, the whole thing will get lopsided

1211
00:49:46.411 --> 00:49:47.485
and it'll all fall apart.

1212
00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:48.568
TALIESIN: Like pants?

1213
00:49:49.818 --> 00:49:50.747
MARISHA: Like pants.

1214
00:49:50.747 --> 00:49:52.967
TALIESIN: Just do one leg at a time,

1215
00:49:52.967 --> 00:49:54.457
one barrel strap at a time.

1216
00:49:54.457 --> 00:49:58.220
MARISHA: Talking about a two-sided approach.

1217
00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.457
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, never mind.

1218
00:49:59.457 --> 00:50:01.624
LAURA: Oh, you have to put them together, you mean?

1219
00:50:01.624 --> 00:50:03.778
SAM: You mean that we should also ally ourselves--

1220
00:50:03.778 --> 00:50:04.761
ASHLEY: Two separate--

1221
00:50:04.761 --> 00:50:06.212
I see.
SAM: I don't understand.

1222
00:50:06.212 --> 00:50:07.568
MARISHA: Or, okay, different analogy,

1223
00:50:07.568 --> 00:50:08.537
but similar thing--

1224
00:50:08.537 --> 00:50:10.065
SAM: Are you saying that we should also

1225
00:50:10.065 --> 00:50:12.218
ally ourselves with the Empire at the same time?

1226
00:50:12.218 --> 00:50:13.639
LAURA: And just play everybody.

1227
00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:14.751
MARISHA: No, I'm saying--

1228
00:50:14.751 --> 00:50:16.059
LAURA: Let's form our own country.

1229
00:50:16.059 --> 00:50:17.461
SAM: Hold on.
MARISHA: I'm saying...

1230
00:50:17.461 --> 00:50:22.069
(laughter)

1231
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:26.950
(laughter)

1232
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:29.176
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

1233
00:50:29.176 --> 00:50:30.476
MATT: The rest of the campaign is

1234
00:50:30.476 --> 00:50:31.790
just watching everyone kill each other from a distance

1235
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:35.821
as you guys just mark off a beach somewhere north.

1236
00:50:35.821 --> 00:50:37.106
This is Jesterlands.

1237
00:50:37.106 --> 00:50:39.974
TALIESIN: We're just going to have an oil drilling station

1238
00:50:39.974 --> 00:50:42.157
and we're just going to trade Bitcoin.

1239
00:50:42.157 --> 00:50:43.682
(laughter)

1240
00:50:43.682 --> 00:50:45.218
TRAVIS: It's not a good beach.

1241
00:50:45.218 --> 00:50:48.194
(laughter)

1242
00:50:48.194 --> 00:50:50.275
Holy fuck.

1243
00:50:50.275 --> 00:50:52.132
MATT: As you were saying.

1244
00:50:52.132 --> 00:50:55.232
MARISHA: Okay, okay, different analogy.

1245
00:50:55.232 --> 00:50:56.384
SAM: No, no, stick with the barrels.

1246
00:50:56.384 --> 00:50:57.334
TALIESIN: I think the barrel worked.

1247
00:50:57.334 --> 00:50:59.795
MARISHA: When you put lug nuts on a wheel on a wagon

1248
00:50:59.795 --> 00:51:04.209
and you have to put all of them on a little bit

1249
00:51:04.209 --> 00:51:06.389
before you tighten one down,

1250
00:51:06.389 --> 00:51:07.659
before you tighten them all down,

1251
00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:11.513
or else the whole thing gets fucking out of whack.

1252
00:51:11.513 --> 00:51:15.007
TRAVIS: It's more of an 80s car thing, but yeah.

1253
00:51:15.007 --> 00:51:17.128
LAURA: When you're building an Ikea bookshelf

1254
00:51:17.128 --> 00:51:20.577
and you put the things in the holes at the different--

1255
00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:21.858
SAM: Metaphors aside,

1256
00:51:21.858 --> 00:51:24.221
are you saying that we should also be aligning ourselves

1257
00:51:24.221 --> 00:51:26.121
with the Empire

1258
00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:27.705
in a loosey goosey way?

1259
00:51:27.705 --> 00:51:29.921
MARISHA: I'm saying if we're going to

1260
00:51:29.921 --> 00:51:31.606
dismantle this properly--

1261
00:51:31.606 --> 00:51:33.406
LAURA: We're talking quietly, PS.

1262
00:51:33.406 --> 00:51:35.130
MATT: I assume you guys are already back at your house

1263
00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:36.505
by now.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

1264
00:51:36.505 --> 00:51:37.931
MARISHA: If we're going to dismantle this properly,

1265
00:51:37.931 --> 00:51:42.453
it might not be from all one side.

1266
00:51:42.453 --> 00:51:44.478
It might not work if it's all from one side.

1267
00:51:44.478 --> 00:51:46.397
It's kind of what Caleb was saying.

1268
00:51:46.397 --> 00:51:50.267
LIAM: We just need to coordinate with your people.

1269
00:51:50.267 --> 00:51:53.753
MARISHA: Fuck.
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, I don't know.

1270
00:51:53.753 --> 00:51:54.586
I don't know.

1271
00:51:54.586 --> 00:51:56.059
MARISHA: He might not be wrong.

1272
00:51:56.059 --> 00:51:57.590
He might not be wrong.

1273
00:51:57.590 --> 00:51:59.894
LIAM: What if in the next 24 hours you don't--

1274
00:51:59.894 --> 00:52:03.935
Jester, can you put Beauregard in touch with Dairon?

1275
00:52:03.935 --> 00:52:06.435
LAURA: If they don't do the attack,

1276
00:52:08.339 --> 00:52:11.802
then we've proven ourselves as bad informants

1277
00:52:11.802 --> 00:52:14.819
and untrustworthy.

1278
00:52:16.048 --> 00:52:17.385
They need to do the attack.

1279
00:52:17.385 --> 00:52:18.468
TRAVIS: Shit.

1280
00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:21.408
That's a fucking solid point.

1281
00:52:21.408 --> 00:52:24.237
TALIESIN: That would mean they can't know about it.

1282
00:52:24.237 --> 00:52:29.109
MARISHA: Bad informants on which side?

1283
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:30.350
SAM: The Dynasty.

1284
00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:32.201
Yeah, if you tell

1285
00:52:32.201 --> 00:52:34.983
your friend and she tells home base

1286
00:52:34.983 --> 00:52:36.109
and they don't do the attack,

1287
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:38.734
then we've fucked ourselves.

1288
00:52:38.734 --> 00:52:40.705
You shouldn't talk to your friend now.

1289
00:52:40.705 --> 00:52:45.688
MARISHA: I don't have to tell her everything.

1290
00:52:46.619 --> 00:52:48.198
LIAM: There you go.

1291
00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.377
TALIESIN: The only way that they know

1292
00:52:49.377 --> 00:52:52.017
that they can continue to get good information from us

1293
00:52:52.017 --> 00:52:55.891
is if the attack's successful anyway.

1294
00:52:55.891 --> 00:52:56.967
TALIESIN: If we prevent it, then we're no longer

1295
00:52:56.967 --> 00:52:58.575
of value to anybody.

1296
00:52:58.575 --> 00:52:59.885
LIAM: Before too long,

1297
00:52:59.885 --> 00:53:03.539
we are going to want to coordinate with your order,

1298
00:53:03.539 --> 00:53:06.539
but your reservations are plausible.

1299
00:53:07.805 --> 00:53:10.193
So maybe we see this through.

1300
00:53:10.193 --> 00:53:11.606
MARISHA: I could get in contact with her

1301
00:53:11.606 --> 00:53:14.401
and I could just mention the rifts.

1302
00:53:14.401 --> 00:53:15.234
LIAM: Yeah.

1303
00:53:15.234 --> 00:53:19.789
I worry about you stumbling across her before

1304
00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:21.506
letting them know.

1305
00:53:24.573 --> 00:53:25.907
You follow?

1306
00:53:27.292 --> 00:53:28.379
MARISHA: Yeah.

1307
00:53:28.379 --> 00:53:29.212
LIAM: Okay.

1308
00:53:34.337 --> 00:53:36.014
Back to your point

1309
00:53:36.014 --> 00:53:37.794
about the attack having to happen,

1310
00:53:37.794 --> 00:53:40.470
I agree with that wholeheartedly, Jester,

1311
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:44.247
but people, operatives die in the field all the time.

1312
00:53:44.247 --> 00:53:48.080
Just all of them need to die at this location.

1313
00:53:49.077 --> 00:53:50.678
There can't be anybody to report back.

1314
00:53:50.678 --> 00:53:52.755
They all need to die

1315
00:53:52.755 --> 00:53:55.026
except for our prisoner

1316
00:53:55.026 --> 00:53:56.944
or we take them all prisoners.

1317
00:53:56.944 --> 00:53:59.154
MARISHA: You want to kill Maruo?

1318
00:53:59.154 --> 00:54:02.065
SAM: Or capture.
LIAM: Capture.

1319
00:54:02.065 --> 00:54:03.561
They just can't be allowed to communicate.

1320
00:54:03.561 --> 00:54:04.793
SAM: This is happening tomorrow?

1321
00:54:04.793 --> 00:54:06.605
LAURA: Yes.

1322
00:54:06.605 --> 00:54:08.752
MATT: You're not certain what time, just tomorrow.

1323
00:54:08.752 --> 00:54:12.168
SAM: Well, should we stop thinking about

1324
00:54:12.168 --> 00:54:15.132
the broader strategy

1325
00:54:15.132 --> 00:54:16.691
and start thinking more tactically

1326
00:54:16.691 --> 00:54:18.398
about how we're going to surround this place

1327
00:54:18.398 --> 00:54:20.563
and set an ambush?

1328
00:54:20.563 --> 00:54:22.006
MARISHA: Capturing him, though,

1329
00:54:22.006 --> 00:54:22.839
if we capture him

1330
00:54:22.839 --> 00:54:24.541
and we still let Maruo go

1331
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:26.758
and if she is a mole and an informant--

1332
00:54:26.758 --> 00:54:28.505
LAURA: We've got to kill her.

1333
00:54:28.505 --> 00:54:30.091
SAM: There's also the invisible bugbear.

1334
00:54:30.091 --> 00:54:31.478
MARISHA: But she would report back

1335
00:54:31.478 --> 00:54:34.159
that he had been captured.

1336
00:54:34.159 --> 00:54:35.484
ASHLEY: Maybe we capture all of them.

1337
00:54:35.484 --> 00:54:37.242
LAURA: That's what I mean. We have to--

1338
00:54:37.242 --> 00:54:38.255
LIAM: Get all of them.

1339
00:54:38.255 --> 00:54:39.239
LAURA: Yeah.

1340
00:54:39.239 --> 00:54:43.749
MARISHA: But he could potentially be the leak of the attack?

1341
00:54:43.749 --> 00:54:44.822
TRAVIS: Which one?
SAM: Who?

1342
00:54:44.822 --> 00:54:46.239
ASHLEY: The invisible--

1343
00:54:48.167 --> 00:54:49.856
MARISHA: The blonde guy.

1344
00:54:49.856 --> 00:54:53.037
TALIESIN: Blondie bear.
LAURA: Oh, I understand.

1345
00:54:53.037 --> 00:54:54.608
MARISHA: If I'm Maruo--

1346
00:54:54.608 --> 00:54:55.441
TRAVIS: What's our code word

1347
00:54:55.441 --> 00:54:56.782
for that son of a bitch, by the way?

1348
00:54:56.782 --> 00:54:58.065
LAURA: Blondie.

1349
00:54:58.065 --> 00:54:59.599
TALIESIN: Greg Blondie.

1350
00:54:59.599 --> 00:55:00.444
TRAVIS: That's the best we got?

1351
00:55:00.444 --> 00:55:01.728
SAM: Greg.

1352
00:55:01.728 --> 00:55:03.303
TRAVIS: Greg, okay, Greg.

1353
00:55:03.303 --> 00:55:05.952
MATT: He looked like a Greg, sure.

1354
00:55:05.952 --> 00:55:07.410
MARISHA: Because if I was Maruo,

1355
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:11.743
I would immediately, if I'm a mole, say,

1356
00:55:11.743 --> 00:55:14.228
"Greg's been captured."

1357
00:55:14.228 --> 00:55:16.319
If an attack doesn't happen

1358
00:55:16.319 --> 00:55:20.733
or if something goes amiss

1359
00:55:20.733 --> 00:55:21.740
and I'm the Empire,

1360
00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:26.474
I would assume that it was Greg leaking information

1361
00:55:26.474 --> 00:55:28.780
through torture--
SAM: It doesn't matter

1362
00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:31.103
because we're going to capture Maruo,

1363
00:55:31.103 --> 00:55:32.493
we're going to capture the bugbear,

1364
00:55:32.493 --> 00:55:33.408
we're going to do it all.

1365
00:55:33.408 --> 00:55:34.728
It won't matter, no leaks.

1366
00:55:34.728 --> 00:55:36.154
MARISHA: But what I'm saying is--

1367
00:55:36.154 --> 00:55:37.886
LAURA: You want it to be a leak?

1368
00:55:37.886 --> 00:55:39.495
I don't understand.
SAM: You want it

1369
00:55:39.495 --> 00:55:42.638
to get back to the Empire that Greg was captured?

1370
00:55:43.513 --> 00:55:46.680
MARISHA: If they know that the Dynasty knows,

1371
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:49.424
maybe more people live?

1372
00:55:49.424 --> 00:55:53.776
LAURA: If they know that Greg was captured,

1373
00:55:53.776 --> 00:55:55.584
then we didn't do our job right

1374
00:55:55.584 --> 00:55:57.591
and we still aren't serving the Bright Queens

1375
00:55:57.591 --> 00:55:58.709
the way that she expects.

1376
00:55:58.709 --> 00:56:00.261
SAM: The Bright Queen said go do it, can you do it?

1377
00:56:00.261 --> 00:56:01.229
We said yes.

1378
00:56:01.229 --> 00:56:02.532
If we let somebody go,

1379
00:56:02.532 --> 00:56:03.852
we'll have failed.

1380
00:56:03.852 --> 00:56:05.925
TALIESIN: Then they'll also know who it was.

1381
00:56:05.925 --> 00:56:09.780
TRAVIS: Yeah. Look, we're real good at handling a situation.

1382
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:13.637
We're entering a bit of analysis paralysis, okay?

1383
00:56:13.637 --> 00:56:17.220
Why don't we focus on the task tomorrow,

1384
00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.851
check it out tonight, make sure there's no--
(knocking)

1385
00:56:19.851 --> 00:56:20.684
(gasps)

1386
00:56:20.684 --> 00:56:22.178
MATT: There's a knock at the door at the front of the

1387
00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:23.552
estate, the Xhorhouse.
SAM: Fuck.

1388
00:56:23.552 --> 00:56:25.421
TRAVIS: I got it, I got it, I got it.

1389
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:27.485
MARISHA: I hide around the corner.

1390
00:56:27.485 --> 00:56:28.559
TRAVIS: I'll just crack the door,

1391
00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:30.723
but keep my foot on the other side of it.

1392
00:56:30.723 --> 00:56:31.757
Hello?

1393
00:56:31.757 --> 00:56:32.888
MATT: Looking through at this late hour,

1394
00:56:32.888 --> 00:56:36.305
you see two Aurora Watch soldiers,

1395
00:56:37.273 --> 00:56:42.266
armored, both holding in their hands heavy, it looks like,

1396
00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:45.703
handles on each side an iron box.

1397
00:56:45.703 --> 00:56:47.388
TRAVIS: How can I help you this evening?

1398
00:56:47.388 --> 00:56:49.562
MATT: "Delivery from Bright Queen."

1399
00:56:49.562 --> 00:56:51.596
TRAVIS: Oh, please bring it in.

1400
00:56:51.596 --> 00:56:53.229
TALIESIN: Ting, ting, ting!

1401
00:56:53.229 --> 00:56:54.170
LAURA: (jangling)

1402
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:55.306
TALIESIN: I'm going to do it every time.

1403
00:56:55.306 --> 00:56:56.408
MATT: Yeah, the chimes.

1404
00:56:56.408 --> 00:56:57.253
They walk in.

1405
00:56:57.253 --> 00:56:59.048
They don't pay much attention to the interior,

1406
00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:01.285
but they both walk into the center of the main

1407
00:57:01.285 --> 00:57:05.501
foyer area there and drop it on the ground.

1408
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:07.934
It's a heavy, plain iron chest.

1409
00:57:07.934 --> 00:57:08.767
TRAVIS: Single chest?

1410
00:57:08.767 --> 00:57:11.151
MATT: Single chest, yeah. They both drop it.

1411
00:57:11.151 --> 00:57:14.220
LAURA: Is it a dress for me like hers?

1412
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.370
MATT: "It is a delivered reward from the Bright Queen,"

1413
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:18.842
and they both turn around and leave.

1414
00:57:18.842 --> 00:57:19.782
SAM: Should we tip?

1415
00:57:19.782 --> 00:57:22.281
TRAVIS: No.
SAM: Okay.

1416
00:57:22.281 --> 00:57:23.448
TALIESIN: Tip the hat.

1417
00:57:25.092 --> 00:57:26.902
SAM: Let's open it!
LAURA: (excited squeal)

1418
00:57:26.902 --> 00:57:28.044
SAM: I'll go check it for traps.

1419
00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:30.436
TRAVIS: Wait, yeah, I don't know.

1420
00:57:30.436 --> 00:57:31.756
I want to think it's something good,

1421
00:57:31.756 --> 00:57:32.708
but what if it ain't?

1422
00:57:32.708 --> 00:57:33.800
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

1423
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.599
TALIESIN: It's a little late. We're living in her house.

1424
00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:37.265
SAM: 24.

1425
00:57:37.265 --> 00:57:39.345
LAURA: Your arm hair is tickling me.

1426
00:57:39.345 --> 00:57:40.263
SAM: My armor?

1427
00:57:40.263 --> 00:57:41.125
LAURA: Your arm hair.

1428
00:57:41.125 --> 00:57:41.958
SAM: Oh.

1429
00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.748
MATT: As you go over this iron chest,

1430
00:57:43.748 --> 00:57:45.719
checking out the various nooks and crannies of it,

1431
00:57:45.719 --> 00:57:49.133
you notice that it is not trapped.

1432
00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:50.770
LAURA: Open it, open it.

1433
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:52.477
MATT: It's not locked.

1434
00:57:52.477 --> 00:57:56.033
It is a vast amount of gold coins.

1435
00:57:56.033 --> 00:57:56.866
SAM: Ooh!

1436
00:57:58.686 --> 00:58:00.697
SAM and LAURA: How much?

1437
00:58:00.697 --> 00:58:02.193
MATT: You want to take some time to count?

1438
00:58:02.193 --> 00:58:03.035
LAURA: Caleb.

1439
00:58:03.035 --> 00:58:05.608
MARISHA: Yeah, you're going to be up all night.

1440
00:58:05.608 --> 00:58:08.894
MATT: The chest probably weights a little over 300 pounds.

1441
00:58:08.894 --> 00:58:09.894
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1442
00:58:11.162 --> 00:58:16.121
MATT: It's 15,500 gold pieces.

1443
00:58:17.241 --> 00:58:18.716
LIAM: 14,532.

1444
00:58:20.074 --> 00:58:23.074
LAURA: Somebody write that down.
TRAVIS: I got it.

1445
00:58:23.074 --> 00:58:24.407
LIAM: 15 and change?

1446
00:58:25.266 --> 00:58:26.099
SAM: 15,500.

1447
00:58:27.185 --> 00:58:28.526
LAURA: Whoa. (gasps)

1448
00:58:28.526 --> 00:58:30.687
Yasha, you can get your stuff!

1449
00:58:30.687 --> 00:58:32.603
ASHLEY: Yes.
MARISHA: Oh yeah!

1450
00:58:34.646 --> 00:58:37.586
TALIESIN: I can finally finish up that project for you

1451
00:58:37.586 --> 00:58:40.754
that I've been meaning to finish up.

1452
00:58:40.754 --> 00:58:41.599
SAM: Are we going to divvy it up?

1453
00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:42.843
We're divvying it up.

1454
00:58:42.843 --> 00:58:43.676
TRAVIS: Sure.

1455
00:58:43.676 --> 00:58:46.872
SAM: 2,214 to everyone.

1456
00:58:46.872 --> 00:58:48.372
LAURA: What, that's it?

1457
00:58:50.172 --> 00:58:51.385
MARISHA: Two thousand what?

1458
00:58:51.385 --> 00:58:54.554
SAM: 2,214.

1459
00:58:54.554 --> 00:58:56.421
TRAVIS: That's fucking awesome.

1460
00:58:56.421 --> 00:58:58.410
MATT: You get the sense this is most likely a reward

1461
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:01.077
for presenting this information.

1462
00:59:03.899 --> 00:59:04.866
MARISHA: That's cool.

1463
00:59:04.866 --> 00:59:05.699
TALIESIN: Wow.

1464
00:59:06.735 --> 00:59:08.715
MARISHA: That helps.

1465
00:59:08.715 --> 00:59:10.357
TALIESIN: That certainly is an improvement.

1466
00:59:10.357 --> 00:59:12.508
TRAVIS: Anything about the box that we notice?

1467
00:59:12.508 --> 00:59:16.078
Any sort of etching on the inside of it?

1468
00:59:16.078 --> 00:59:17.205
MATT: Make a perception check.

1469
00:59:17.205 --> 00:59:18.703
TRAVIS: Yeah, I will.

1470
00:59:18.703 --> 00:59:19.536
Kerplunk.

1471
00:59:20.956 --> 00:59:21.789
13.

1472
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:24.060
MATT: No, it's just like a box.

1473
00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.151
You now have an iron chest

1474
00:59:25.151 --> 00:59:28.654
as one of your various pieces of furniture

1475
00:59:28.654 --> 00:59:30.025
in the household.

1476
00:59:30.025 --> 00:59:31.757
LAURA: Ooh!
TALIESIN: Does it have a magical aura?

1477
00:59:31.757 --> 00:59:33.710
MARISHA: Can we fashion a lock on that?

1478
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:34.543
TALIESIN: Sure.

1479
00:59:34.543 --> 00:59:36.611
MATT: There's a space for a lock to be put on it,

1480
00:59:36.611 --> 00:59:38.522
but it's not locked,

1481
00:59:38.522 --> 00:59:39.480
nor does it come with one.

1482
00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:40.676
LAURA: This is going to be our coffee table.

1483
00:59:40.676 --> 00:59:42.525
LIAM: Yeah, we'll just put a throw over it.

1484
00:59:42.525 --> 00:59:43.387
LAURA: Yeah.

1485
00:59:43.387 --> 00:59:44.267
MATT: There you go.

1486
00:59:44.267 --> 00:59:47.100
SAM: I think we've decided correctly.

1487
00:59:48.886 --> 00:59:51.254
TRAVIS: Okay, so the house, right?

1488
00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:53.658
Who is it that saw the bugbear turn invisible?

1489
00:59:53.658 --> 00:59:55.644
SAM: Caleb's cat.
TRAVIS: Right.

1490
00:59:55.644 --> 00:59:57.678
We need to establish if there is any way

1491
00:59:57.678 --> 00:59:59.720
up into the house from underneath, right?

1492
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.128
Because we know where the entrances

1493
01:00:01.128 --> 01:00:02.515
and exits of that house are,

1494
01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:05.181
but we have to lay in wait.

1495
01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:06.802
LAURA: All day long.

1496
01:00:06.802 --> 01:00:09.646
He could be there at 1:00am,

1497
01:00:09.646 --> 01:00:10.896
I don't know if that's a real time here.

1498
01:00:10.896 --> 01:00:11.899
TRAVIS: It could be at the stroke of midnight.

1499
01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:13.622
It could be at 12:01am.

1500
01:00:13.622 --> 01:00:15.490
TALIESIN: It could be a teleport in and out

1501
01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:17.423
without actually entering the building.

1502
01:00:17.423 --> 01:00:20.007
LAURA: We need to be in there.

1503
01:00:20.007 --> 01:00:21.368
TALIESIN: Or we wait till they're--

1504
01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.545
I don't know, that's the question,

1505
01:00:22.545 --> 01:00:24.727
do we wait till they're done having their conversation?

1506
01:00:24.727 --> 01:00:25.874
SAM: Should we go tonight

1507
01:00:25.874 --> 01:00:27.986
and just sort of scope out the neighbors,

1508
01:00:27.986 --> 01:00:30.238
the rooftops across the street?

1509
01:00:30.238 --> 01:00:31.071
TRAVIS: Are there sewers?

1510
01:00:31.071 --> 01:00:32.654
Yeah.

1511
01:00:32.654 --> 01:00:33.704
Jester's right,

1512
01:00:33.704 --> 01:00:35.992
we are going to need at least one person in there

1513
01:00:35.992 --> 01:00:40.094
to yell, you know, "Cheeto" if shit goes off.

1514
01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:42.019
TALIESIN: We should let them talk too.

1515
01:00:42.019 --> 01:00:42.852
LAURA: I have a question.

1516
01:00:42.852 --> 01:00:43.935
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1517
01:00:43.935 --> 01:00:47.435
LAURA: Do I know, from my use of the paints,

1518
01:00:48.459 --> 01:00:51.538
does it make a sound when I do it or is it quiet?

1519
01:00:51.538 --> 01:00:54.305
MATT: It's as quiet as paints can be.

1520
01:00:54.305 --> 01:00:56.918
TALIESIN: That's pretty quiet.

1521
01:00:56.918 --> 01:00:58.077
LAURA: Pretty quiet.

1522
01:00:58.077 --> 01:00:59.187
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1523
01:00:59.187 --> 01:01:01.038
LAURA: I could make, you know--
MARISHA: Make a door.

1524
01:01:01.038 --> 01:01:03.629
LAURA: Yeah, I could make a door in the back.

1525
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:08.105
TRAVIS: Shall we head that way and at least ask if there are--

1526
01:01:08.105 --> 01:01:11.490
or look for any signs of a visible sewage system

1527
01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:12.403
in this city?

1528
01:01:12.403 --> 01:01:14.220
Do we know? Am I forgetting anything?

1529
01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.425
SAM: We haven't seen sewers here.

1530
01:01:17.425 --> 01:01:19.007
MATT: There are sewers.

1531
01:01:19.007 --> 01:01:21.340
Make an intelligence check.

1532
01:01:22.624 --> 01:01:24.165
TRAVIS: If there are wells in the area--

1533
01:01:24.165 --> 01:01:25.704
MATT: You can as well, if you want to.

1534
01:01:25.704 --> 01:01:26.542
SAM: That's a one.

1535
01:01:26.542 --> 01:01:27.500
MATT: Ah.

1536
01:01:28.784 --> 01:01:31.140
MATT: You haven't gone to the bathroom since you got here.

1537
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.838
SAM: I'm not a good travel pooper.

1538
01:01:32.838 --> 01:01:35.428
(laughter)

1539
01:01:35.428 --> 01:01:36.261
TRAVIS: 19.

1540
01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:37.537
MATT: 19.

1541
01:01:38.704 --> 01:01:40.946
There are sewers, but they're largely focused

1542
01:01:40.946 --> 01:01:44.013
around the more core districts of the cities,

1543
01:01:44.013 --> 01:01:45.562
of the Gallimaufry where you guys have been staying

1544
01:01:45.562 --> 01:01:46.934
and the Firmaments definitely.

1545
01:01:46.934 --> 01:01:49.469
The Coronas, where the Overcrow exists,

1546
01:01:49.469 --> 01:01:50.663
unfortunately though,

1547
01:01:50.663 --> 01:01:54.168
sits in a little more of a rough expansion of the city

1548
01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.720
where there there is no formal sewer system beneath it.

1549
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.444
A lot of it seems to be outhouses and cesspools

1550
01:01:59.444 --> 01:02:02.277
and, you know, tossed as fertilizer.

1551
01:02:03.372 --> 01:02:05.463
LIAM: Also this evening, we could go--

1552
01:02:05.463 --> 01:02:08.541
I could have Frumpkin be something much smaller,

1553
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:10.996
an insect, an invisible insect

1554
01:02:10.996 --> 01:02:13.987
and to check out the entire building, hopefully.

1555
01:02:13.987 --> 01:02:15.989
We didn't see all of it, I don't think.

1556
01:02:15.989 --> 01:02:17.255
TALIESIN: We didn't see the upstairs.

1557
01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:18.521
MATT: You didn't see the upstairs, no.

1558
01:02:18.521 --> 01:02:22.076
LAURA: I could make any of us be an insect as well.

1559
01:02:22.076 --> 01:02:23.593
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: About what time is it right now?

1560
01:02:23.593 --> 01:02:25.026
Caleb will know what time it is.

1561
01:02:25.026 --> 01:02:25.891
MATT: I'd say, by this time,

1562
01:02:25.891 --> 01:02:26.900
it's close to midnight.

1563
01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:27.884
MARISHA: Right, we're just late.

1564
01:02:27.884 --> 01:02:31.425
MARISHA: Oh, so it's the 13th day, like ding, ding?

1565
01:02:31.425 --> 01:02:32.935
MATT: Right about now, yeah.

1566
01:02:32.935 --> 01:02:34.730
TRAVIS: So in, like, one minute we're in the day?

1567
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:35.863
MATT: You're in the day.

1568
01:02:35.863 --> 01:02:37.787
TRAVIS: Fuck, we got to go.

1569
01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.234
TALIESIN: We got to sleep.

1570
01:02:39.234 --> 01:02:41.193
SAM: We got to sleep or do we got to go?

1571
01:02:41.193 --> 01:02:42.932
We just go.
TRAVIS: We just go.

1572
01:02:42.932 --> 01:02:45.093
LAURA: Did we get a good night sleep last night?

1573
01:02:45.093 --> 01:02:46.453
TRAVIS: I mean, it could be at first light.

1574
01:02:46.453 --> 01:02:48.833
MARISHA: I think so, right, we slept?

1575
01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:49.848
Did we sleep?

1576
01:02:49.848 --> 01:02:51.987
MATT: Well, you guys slept the night before.

1577
01:02:51.987 --> 01:02:55.447
TALIESIN: I've already burned my 5th-levels.

1578
01:02:55.447 --> 01:02:56.807
MATT: You can go a night without sleep,

1579
01:02:56.807 --> 01:02:57.916
you're just all going to get a point of exhaustion.

1580
01:02:57.916 --> 01:02:59.200
LAURA: That's true, we did, didn't we?

1581
01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.183
We used our fifths?

1582
01:03:00.183 --> 01:03:03.211
MARISHA: Well, what if we camp nearby

1583
01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:05.765
and we have lookouts?

1584
01:03:05.765 --> 01:03:08.694
Camp in the bubble?
SAM: Tonight? Sure.

1585
01:03:08.694 --> 01:03:10.666
Let's go over there and see if there's any--

1586
01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:12.612
we could sleep on the roof across the street.

1587
01:03:12.612 --> 01:03:15.128
LIAM: We could take one hour to go look around right now.

1588
01:03:15.128 --> 01:03:16.326
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Let's do it.

1589
01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:17.662
TRAVIS: Okay, let's do it.

1590
01:03:17.662 --> 01:03:18.495
MATT: All right.

1591
01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:20.778
You guys are heading over towards the Coronas,

1592
01:03:20.778 --> 01:03:22.712
toward the Overcrow? Okay.

1593
01:03:22.712 --> 01:03:24.356
You gather your things,

1594
01:03:24.356 --> 01:03:26.575
prepare yourselves for, I guess, a camping night

1595
01:03:26.575 --> 01:03:29.825
under the stars in the beautiful streets of the Coronas.

1596
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.120
TALIESIN: I tried to scry.

1597
01:03:35.903 --> 01:03:37.184
TRAVIS: It's still the same 24 hours.

1598
01:03:37.184 --> 01:03:38.503
LAURA: It is, it's the same 24 hours?

1599
01:03:38.503 --> 01:03:39.336
TALIESIN: Same 24 hours.

1600
01:03:39.336 --> 01:03:40.197
LAURA: Did I scry too?

1601
01:03:40.197 --> 01:03:41.030
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1602
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:42.356
So your 5th is also burnt.

1603
01:03:42.356 --> 01:03:44.304
LAURA: Oh, why did I put down that I slept?

1604
01:03:44.304 --> 01:03:46.951
SAM: Because you slept in real life

1605
01:03:46.951 --> 01:03:48.236
and you're a dirty cheater.

1606
01:03:48.236 --> 01:03:50.486
(laughter)

1607
01:03:51.334 --> 01:03:52.404
LAURA: Oh no, no, no, my 5th-level.

1608
01:03:52.404 --> 01:03:53.270
Okay, okay, okay.

1609
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:54.905
My 5th-level's gone, never mind.

1610
01:03:54.905 --> 01:03:58.301
MATT: You make your way to the Gallimaufry.

1611
01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:00.017
At this hour,

1612
01:04:00.017 --> 01:04:03.062
there's still some bodies going through the streets,

1613
01:04:03.062 --> 01:04:07.378
some individuals: drow, goblinoid,

1614
01:04:07.378 --> 01:04:09.371
different figures doing business,

1615
01:04:09.371 --> 01:04:11.837
but it all seems to be very much like

1616
01:04:11.837 --> 01:04:16.428
a late night graveyard shift type

1617
01:04:16.428 --> 01:04:19.178
general sense and what little bit of business

1618
01:04:19.178 --> 01:04:20.578
seems to pass you as you make your way

1619
01:04:20.578 --> 01:04:22.886
to the outskirts of Rosohna.

1620
01:04:22.886 --> 01:04:24.811
Eventually, you come to the street,

1621
01:04:24.811 --> 01:04:26.491
familiar to you now definitely as you--

1622
01:04:26.491 --> 01:04:28.944
LAURA: Should we be stealthy as we're going over there?

1623
01:04:28.944 --> 01:04:29.976
TALIESIN: Not yet.

1624
01:04:29.976 --> 01:04:30.809
LAURA: Okay.

1625
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:34.841
MATT: You turn into the outskirts of the city in Coronas

1626
01:04:34.841 --> 01:04:36.254
and eventually come to the street

1627
01:04:36.254 --> 01:04:38.328
where you can see, just as you come

1628
01:04:38.328 --> 01:04:40.371
around the edge of the curving outer ring

1629
01:04:40.371 --> 01:04:41.464
of this side of the district,

1630
01:04:41.464 --> 01:04:42.502
just beyond the western side,

1631
01:04:42.502 --> 01:04:44.647
west-northwest side of the city

1632
01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:46.779
where the Overcrow resides.

1633
01:04:46.779 --> 01:04:49.609
MARISHA: I put my hood up and the cloak and hiding face.

1634
01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:50.442
MATT: Yeah.

1635
01:04:51.692 --> 01:04:52.525
So--

1636
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.618
Actually, let me show you the layout,

1637
01:04:56.618 --> 01:04:57.875
since you are scoping it out.

1638
01:04:57.875 --> 01:04:58.914
TRAVIS: Bring out the maps.

1639
01:04:58.914 --> 01:05:00.727
SAM: Oh shit. Oh, I got a job to do.

1640
01:05:00.727 --> 01:05:05.727
As we enter this sneaky part of the show.

1641
01:05:05.796 --> 01:05:09.209
This sneaky part of the show is powered by Dwarven Forge.

1642
01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:10.865
This is my Dwarven Forge hat.

1643
01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.135
They currently have a free PDF.

1644
01:05:13.135 --> 01:05:14.265
How many pages?

1645
01:05:14.265 --> 01:05:16.441
406 pages.

1646
01:05:16.441 --> 01:05:19.048
It's a module tied to their Dungeons of Doom products

1647
01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:22.029
available now on their website.

1648
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:25.156
I feel like I need something for the hat to dress it up

1649
01:05:25.156 --> 01:05:26.809
like some bling of some sort.

1650
01:05:26.809 --> 01:05:28.870
LAURA: We should put a beard-- oh, you have a beard.

1651
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:29.732
SAM: A beard on the hat?

1652
01:05:29.732 --> 01:05:30.876
LAURA: Yeah, like hanging down?

1653
01:05:30.876 --> 01:05:32.652
SAM: Oh, you mean to cover my beard?

1654
01:05:32.652 --> 01:05:33.919
LAURA: Yeah.

1655
01:05:33.919 --> 01:05:36.614
MATT: You guys are looking around this side of the street.

1656
01:05:36.614 --> 01:05:40.044
This is the Overcrow right here.

1657
01:05:40.044 --> 01:05:40.877
There is the one,

1658
01:05:40.877 --> 01:05:42.455
it's thin on one side and tall

1659
01:05:42.455 --> 01:05:43.969
and this is where the storage room was

1660
01:05:43.969 --> 01:05:45.870
where you guys had entered through the window in the back.

1661
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:47.644
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1662
01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:48.644
MATT: All right?

1663
01:05:50.221 --> 01:05:51.604
There's the one chamber.

1664
01:05:51.604 --> 01:05:54.695
This is the alleyway that was behind

1665
01:05:54.695 --> 01:05:56.060
and that's the front door right there.

1666
01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.210
TRAVIS: That roof is burning by the time this day is done.

1667
01:05:58.210 --> 01:05:59.460
TALIESIN: I see there--

1668
01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.472
MARISHA: Feel bad for the thatched roof.

1669
01:06:01.472 --> 01:06:03.596
TRAVIS: Lighting 'em up, Caleb.

1670
01:06:03.596 --> 01:06:05.753
LIAM: You got it, Travis.

1671
01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:07.412
MARISHA: What is--
ASHLEY: What's this here?

1672
01:06:07.412 --> 01:06:08.257
This is just another--?

1673
01:06:08.257 --> 01:06:10.562
MATT: This is just another buildings nearby, other chambers.

1674
01:06:10.562 --> 01:06:12.027
SAM: Do we know if they're residential, business?

1675
01:06:12.027 --> 01:06:13.590
MATT: They look both,

1676
01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:15.086
and a lot of the Coronas

1677
01:06:15.086 --> 01:06:18.996
is a mixture of whatever is available.

1678
01:06:18.996 --> 01:06:21.492
Residential can be jammed in the middle of anywhere.

1679
01:06:21.492 --> 01:06:24.882
TALIESIN: Any of them look abandoned?

1680
01:06:24.882 --> 01:06:26.561
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1681
01:06:26.561 --> 01:06:28.192
MARISHA: Can we do a little scoutsies of these buildings?

1682
01:06:28.192 --> 01:06:29.090
MATT: Sure.

1683
01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:30.562
SAM: Who's going to go scoutsies?

1684
01:06:30.562 --> 01:06:32.094
MARISHA: I'll scout.
TALIESIN: Preferably not me.

1685
01:06:32.094 --> 01:06:32.938
SAM: I'll go with you as well.

1686
01:06:32.938 --> 01:06:34.027
MARISHA: Okay.

1687
01:06:34.027 --> 01:06:35.033
TRAVIS: As we've been walking,

1688
01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:36.388
have we seen any drunkards,

1689
01:06:36.388 --> 01:06:39.472
people that are tossed a little, posted up?

1690
01:06:39.472 --> 01:06:40.612
MATT: Perception check.

1691
01:06:40.612 --> 01:06:42.073
TRAVIS: Yeah, just casual drunk folk,

1692
01:06:42.073 --> 01:06:43.991
nothing crazy.

1693
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:45.153
MARISHA: 20.
TRAVIS: 16.

1694
01:06:45.153 --> 01:06:47.331
SAM: Are we rolling for stealth or investigation?

1695
01:06:47.331 --> 01:06:49.412
MATT: No, we have a few things going on here.

1696
01:06:49.412 --> 01:06:50.245
Let me work through it.

1697
01:06:50.245 --> 01:06:51.454
You guys are just doing a general--

1698
01:06:51.454 --> 01:06:53.670
LAURA: Investigation for empty places.

1699
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:54.569
Did you end up going?

1700
01:06:54.569 --> 01:06:55.818
TALIESIN: I was letting you guys do that.

1701
01:06:55.818 --> 01:06:58.351
SAM: Me and Beau are going to do that.

1702
01:06:58.351 --> 01:06:59.184
All right.

1703
01:06:59.184 --> 01:07:00.462
You rolled a 20?

1704
01:07:00.462 --> 01:07:02.068
SAM: I don't know what I'm rolling for,

1705
01:07:02.068 --> 01:07:03.814
investigation or stealth?
MATT: Investigation.

1706
01:07:03.814 --> 01:07:05.648
SAM: Okay, 16.

1707
01:07:05.648 --> 01:07:06.526
MATT: 16.

1708
01:07:06.526 --> 01:07:10.601
In taking some time to look around and look for signs of--

1709
01:07:12.183 --> 01:07:17.183
this building looks like it is a small hostel of some kind.

1710
01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:19.102
This appears to be residential.

1711
01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:21.108
That appears to be residential.

1712
01:07:21.108 --> 01:07:23.516
That appears to be,

1713
01:07:23.516 --> 01:07:24.929
it was once residential,

1714
01:07:24.929 --> 01:07:27.410
but looks like it's been locked up

1715
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.659
or it has been not touched in a while.

1716
01:07:29.659 --> 01:07:33.092
You're not sure what that the usage of that one is or not.

1717
01:07:35.159 --> 01:07:37.567
You do get-- at this late hour,

1718
01:07:37.567 --> 01:07:38.865
you don't see any movement.

1719
01:07:38.865 --> 01:07:40.658
The hostel has people occasionally going through.

1720
01:07:40.658 --> 01:07:42.430
You can see some light in some of the windows.

1721
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:44.043
There's life on this side.

1722
01:07:44.043 --> 01:07:45.817
You don't see any signs here,

1723
01:07:45.817 --> 01:07:47.399
maybe sleeping or nobody's home,

1724
01:07:47.399 --> 01:07:49.918
but those of both appear to be in common use

1725
01:07:49.918 --> 01:07:51.114
and residential-based

1726
01:07:51.114 --> 01:07:54.758
and that's the one that's in the iffy space

1727
01:07:54.758 --> 01:07:55.722
at the moment.

1728
01:07:55.722 --> 01:07:57.456
TALIESIN: That might be our base of operations.

1729
01:07:57.456 --> 01:08:00.266
LIAM: I think we should combine our ideas.

1730
01:08:00.266 --> 01:08:02.942
Why don't you turn into a bumblebee or a moth

1731
01:08:02.942 --> 01:08:04.314
and I will turn invisible

1732
01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:07.111
and then you can look inside all of the buildings,

1733
01:08:07.111 --> 01:08:07.944
especially--

1734
01:08:07.944 --> 01:08:09.841
MATT: An hour into the scoping,

1735
01:08:09.841 --> 01:08:11.618
you do see a pair of goblins

1736
01:08:11.618 --> 01:08:13.664
that are both zigzagging

1737
01:08:13.664 --> 01:08:15.544
heading just from this way

1738
01:08:15.544 --> 01:08:18.320
making their way through the district.

1739
01:08:19.445 --> 01:08:21.419
LIAM: I'm sorry, go ahead.

1740
01:08:21.419 --> 01:08:23.531
LAURA: No, I can do that for sure?

1741
01:08:23.531 --> 01:08:24.766
LIAM: Can you remind me, DM,

1742
01:08:24.766 --> 01:08:27.124
was this past day that we're awake

1743
01:08:27.124 --> 01:08:31.239
the day that Essek would have taught Caleb those spells

1744
01:08:31.239 --> 01:08:33.055
or was it an earlier day?

1745
01:08:33.055 --> 01:08:34.006
MATT: That would've been an earlier day.

1746
01:08:34.006 --> 01:08:34.839
LIAM: Okay.

1747
01:08:37.964 --> 01:08:39.939
LAURA: Like a--

1748
01:08:39.939 --> 01:08:41.076
SAM: House rat.

1749
01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:43.281
TRAVIS: Who's breaking into that fucking boarded up house?

1750
01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:44.390
LAURA: Well--

1751
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:45.674
SAM: I can break into that house,

1752
01:08:45.674 --> 01:08:48.469
but recall that at least one of the people

1753
01:08:48.469 --> 01:08:51.654
that were trying to sneaky around is invisible a lot.

1754
01:08:51.654 --> 01:08:54.404
We should just make sure that--

1755
01:08:55.512 --> 01:08:58.461
we should just assume that there's an invisible person

1756
01:08:58.461 --> 01:09:00.789
right outside the front door that's watching,

1757
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:03.052
TRAVIS: Or up in the upper window or whatever.

1758
01:09:03.052 --> 01:09:04.010
SAM: Sure.

1759
01:09:06.302 --> 01:09:08.422
SAM: You want me to go to the building and--?

1760
01:09:08.422 --> 01:09:10.443
TRAVIS: I mean, I would go to this side.

1761
01:09:10.443 --> 01:09:11.526
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

1762
01:09:12.589 --> 01:09:13.422
Want me to go?

1763
01:09:13.422 --> 01:09:14.680
MARISHA: Sure.

1764
01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.847
I'll be lookout.

1765
01:09:15.847 --> 01:09:17.614
I'll stand look out for Nott.

1766
01:09:17.614 --> 01:09:19.800
SAM: All right, let's go.

1767
01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.130
MATT: Okay, perception check from you,

1768
01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:22.963
stealth check for you.

1769
01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:25.882
MARISHA: (whispers) Come on, don't be shitty.

1770
01:09:25.882 --> 01:09:27.184
Okay, okay, okay.

1771
01:09:27.184 --> 01:09:28.351
SAM: Stealth, 28.

1772
01:09:29.596 --> 01:09:31.356
MARISHA: 17 for perception.

1773
01:09:31.356 --> 01:09:32.189
MATT: Yes.

1774
01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:35.069
You keep an eye out for a moment, a beat,

1775
01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:37.196
where there doesn't appear to be any sort of immediate eyes

1776
01:09:37.196 --> 01:09:39.230
on this little central thoroughfare.

1777
01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:41.264
You hand signal to Nott

1778
01:09:41.264 --> 01:09:44.598
and Nott, you dart across with ridiculous speed

1779
01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:46.140
diving into darkness

1780
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.614
and you have no idea where Nott is.

1781
01:09:47.614 --> 01:09:50.969
Nott just vanishes into the shadows.

1782
01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:53.291
You make your way up alongside the building,

1783
01:09:53.291 --> 01:09:54.534
skirt along the outs,

1784
01:09:54.534 --> 01:09:56.751
the left wall from where this is standing.

1785
01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:59.216
Let me give a little perspective here

1786
01:09:59.216 --> 01:10:00.939
just for for positions and such.

1787
01:10:00.939 --> 01:10:01.786
From where you are now,

1788
01:10:01.786 --> 01:10:03.493
it would be about there.

1789
01:10:03.493 --> 01:10:05.676
This is north, south, east, west.

1790
01:10:05.676 --> 01:10:06.509
SAM: I'm over here?

1791
01:10:06.509 --> 01:10:07.842
MATT: No, I'm just,

1792
01:10:07.842 --> 01:10:09.175
I'm saying this direction.

1793
01:10:09.175 --> 01:10:10.008
SAM: I see, I see, I see.

1794
01:10:10.008 --> 01:10:11.092
MATT: You are on this side of the building.

1795
01:10:11.092 --> 01:10:13.978
You're on the northeastern side of the wall.

1796
01:10:13.978 --> 01:10:14.821
SAM: Got it.

1797
01:10:14.821 --> 01:10:16.653
All right, yeah, I'm going to sneak around

1798
01:10:16.653 --> 01:10:20.186
to any window that's sort of the most out of sight.

1799
01:10:20.186 --> 01:10:24.545
MATT: There is a closed window shuttered in the back.

1800
01:10:24.545 --> 01:10:27.970
SAM: I will try to jimmy it if it has a lock

1801
01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:29.303
or just open it.

1802
01:10:30.151 --> 01:10:31.860
MATT: It doesn't have an intricate lock,

1803
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.968
but it does appear there's a board

1804
01:10:32.968 --> 01:10:33.831
on the opposite side.

1805
01:10:33.831 --> 01:10:34.664
You're trying to--

1806
01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:35.497
SAM: A board?

1807
01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:38.158
Okay, so first I'll check it for traps.

1808
01:10:38.158 --> 01:10:40.491
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

1809
01:10:40.491 --> 01:10:41.324
SAM: 17.

1810
01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:42.877
MATT: 17, does not appear to be trapped.

1811
01:10:42.877 --> 01:10:44.602
SAM: Okay, now I will try to open it.

1812
01:10:44.602 --> 01:10:46.855
MATT: So add your dex and perception,

1813
01:10:46.855 --> 01:10:48.541
or dex and proficiency.

1814
01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:49.374
SAM: 16.

1815
01:10:49.374 --> 01:10:50.207
MATT: 16?

1816
01:10:50.207 --> 01:10:51.202
This is not a very difficult--

1817
01:10:51.202 --> 01:10:53.807
it's not an intricate series of chains in this.

1818
01:10:53.807 --> 01:10:55.637
There is literally a wooden board that is jammed in

1819
01:10:55.637 --> 01:10:56.938
to keep the shutters closed.

1820
01:10:56.938 --> 01:11:00.107
You slip it up and it,

1821
01:11:00.107 --> 01:11:02.572
you hear the wood hit on the inside

1822
01:11:02.572 --> 01:11:04.557
because as you slip it up and falls out of its space,

1823
01:11:04.557 --> 01:11:09.474
it does fall about three feet, opens slightly, dark inside.

1824
01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:13.016
Make a perception check.

1825
01:11:13.016 --> 01:11:13.849
SAM: Ten.

1826
01:11:13.849 --> 01:11:14.682
MATT: Ten.

1827
01:11:14.682 --> 01:11:16.951
You don't hear any movement.

1828
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:18.867
TRAVIS: Get in that bitch.

1829
01:11:18.867 --> 01:11:20.450
SAM: I'm going inside.

1830
01:11:21.566 --> 01:11:23.733
(quickly) You-can-respond-to-this-message.

1831
01:11:26.023 --> 01:11:28.151
TALIESIN: I'm quietly heading over there as well.

1832
01:11:28.151 --> 01:11:29.682
MATT: Okay, so you're going to meet up at the same area?

1833
01:11:29.682 --> 01:11:30.515
All right.

1834
01:11:30.515 --> 01:11:31.348
You jump inside.

1835
01:11:31.348 --> 01:11:32.568
The first thing that catches you is a very musty smell

1836
01:11:32.568 --> 01:11:34.150
and a rotting smell.

1837
01:11:34.150 --> 01:11:35.550
Not pleasant.

1838
01:11:36.578 --> 01:11:40.322
LAURA: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1839
01:11:40.322 --> 01:11:41.175
MATT: It's dark in here.

1840
01:11:41.175 --> 01:11:42.424
You do have darkvision, however.

1841
01:11:42.424 --> 01:11:43.632
SAM: I do.

1842
01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.770
MATT: It's a very, very humble home.

1843
01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:47.649
There's a singular table.

1844
01:11:47.649 --> 01:11:48.982
There's one bed.

1845
01:11:50.225 --> 01:11:52.642
There's something on the bed.

1846
01:11:53.549 --> 01:11:54.918
A previous tenant

1847
01:11:54.918 --> 01:11:56.892
that seemed to maybe have passed in the night

1848
01:11:56.892 --> 01:11:59.464
and nobody cared to check in on.

1849
01:11:59.464 --> 01:12:01.139
SAM: Oh no.

1850
01:12:01.139 --> 01:12:02.981
I'll go look at the body.

1851
01:12:02.981 --> 01:12:06.710
Anything-- no foul play, just expired?

1852
01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:08.051
MATT: Make a medicine check.

1853
01:12:08.051 --> 01:12:09.230
As you walk walk up

1854
01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:11.705
you can see partially under

1855
01:12:11.705 --> 01:12:14.872
the now somewhat stained blanket.

1856
01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:15.705
SAM: Five.

1857
01:12:15.705 --> 01:12:16.913
MATT: Five.

1858
01:12:16.913 --> 01:12:18.270
Who knows if it was foul play

1859
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:19.658
or a terrible murder,

1860
01:12:19.658 --> 01:12:22.701
but there is a fairly decomposed corpse here

1861
01:12:22.701 --> 01:12:23.534
of a goblin.

1862
01:12:23.534 --> 01:12:24.367
SAM: Oh, a goblin?

1863
01:12:24.367 --> 01:12:25.200
MATT: A goblin, yeah.

1864
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.033
MARISHA: Bloody?

1865
01:12:27.033 --> 01:12:28.788
MATT: You're not there.

1866
01:12:28.788 --> 01:12:30.323
MARISHA: Oh, I thought you mentioned that, I'm sorry.

1867
01:12:30.323 --> 01:12:32.285
MATT: But, I mean if you want to go and join in.

1868
01:12:32.285 --> 01:12:34.638
With that medicine check you have no idea.

1869
01:12:34.638 --> 01:12:38.915
It's just a mess and it's just gross and like, yeah,

1870
01:12:38.915 --> 01:12:40.092
you have no idea.

1871
01:12:40.092 --> 01:12:41.449
You're not a forensic specialist,

1872
01:12:41.449 --> 01:12:42.482
it's just dead

1873
01:12:42.482 --> 01:12:43.640
and decomposing.
SAM: I'm going to just go around

1874
01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:44.793
and see if there's any other people in there

1875
01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:46.907
anyone hiding, anything trappy?

1876
01:12:46.907 --> 01:12:47.840
MATT: Do a little once over.

1877
01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.213
You don't see any other people in here.

1878
01:12:49.213 --> 01:12:50.046
It's a small chamber,

1879
01:12:50.046 --> 01:12:51.061
there's not a lot of places to hide.

1880
01:12:51.061 --> 01:12:53.947
SAM: Is there a view of the Overcrow from in here?

1881
01:12:53.947 --> 01:12:57.256
MATT: There is a side window on the opposite end of there

1882
01:12:57.256 --> 01:12:58.435
that you can open up and look through

1883
01:12:58.435 --> 01:13:00.125
and there is an angle that you can see the Overcrow

1884
01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:01.639
from that far window on that side,

1885
01:13:01.639 --> 01:13:02.677
or the front door.

1886
01:13:02.677 --> 01:13:03.733
Those are two viewpoints you have.

1887
01:13:03.733 --> 01:13:05.898
SAM: I will message Caleb.

1888
01:13:05.898 --> 01:13:08.520
Caleb, this is a good place for us to hang out.

1889
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.139
There's a dead body in here,

1890
01:13:10.139 --> 01:13:12.986
but otherwise we're aces.

1891
01:13:12.986 --> 01:13:13.871
MATT: Caduceus, you approach.

1892
01:13:13.871 --> 01:13:16.948
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and hop in through the window.

1893
01:13:16.948 --> 01:13:18.698
MARISHA: Caduceus, psst, hi.

1894
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:21.424
MATT: Are you doing this quiet?

1895
01:13:21.424 --> 01:13:22.887
TALIESIN: Oh quiet, yeah.
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1896
01:13:22.887 --> 01:13:24.260
TALIESIN: I'll make a stealth check.

1897
01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:25.093
MARISHA: Nott's in there.

1898
01:13:25.093 --> 01:13:25.926
She can just open the window for you.

1899
01:13:25.926 --> 01:13:27.220
TALIESIN: I thought the window was open.

1900
01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.053
MATT: It was open.

1901
01:13:28.053 --> 01:13:29.458
MARISHA: Oh sorry, the window's open.

1902
01:13:29.458 --> 01:13:30.291
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1903
01:13:30.291 --> 01:13:31.127
MARISHA: Just crawl in.

1904
01:13:31.127 --> 01:13:34.716
What are you talking about?
TALIESIN: That's a five.

1905
01:13:34.716 --> 01:13:37.831
MATT: The vibrant pink of Caduceus'--

1906
01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:39.722
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah that's five.

1907
01:13:39.722 --> 01:13:41.379
LAURA: Why'd you go over there?

1908
01:13:41.379 --> 01:13:44.047
MATT: You make your way and stroll right through,

1909
01:13:44.047 --> 01:13:47.460
get halfway and then, "Oh," hunch,

1910
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.865
make the rest of the path there,

1911
01:13:48.865 --> 01:13:49.713
but it's a stroll.

1912
01:13:49.713 --> 01:13:51.456
MARISHA: We can all still see you, Caduceus.

1913
01:13:51.456 --> 01:13:52.795
TALIESIN: Oh, what?

1914
01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.795
LAURA: You're literally just a big pink--

1915
01:13:54.795 --> 01:13:56.153
TALIESIN: I have a cloak up.

1916
01:13:56.153 --> 01:13:57.922
MATT: You make your way around the chamber.

1917
01:13:57.922 --> 01:13:59.604
The window's open and you--

1918
01:13:59.604 --> 01:14:02.437
it's a small window and you get stuck for a minute.

1919
01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:05.461
You Winnie the Pooh your way through for a second.

1920
01:14:05.461 --> 01:14:06.373
SAM: What are you doing?!

1921
01:14:06.373 --> 01:14:08.194
MATT: You fall onto the floor.

1922
01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.074
TALIESIN: Hi. Yeah.

1923
01:14:10.074 --> 01:14:12.725
SAM: There's a dead goblin over there.

1924
01:14:12.725 --> 01:14:15.092
Can you, like, do your thing?

1925
01:14:15.092 --> 01:14:16.476
TALIESIN: Like what thing? Oh, that thing.

1926
01:14:16.476 --> 01:14:17.802
SAM: Make it decompose or whatever. It's gross.

1927
01:14:17.802 --> 01:14:19.756
MATT: There's already a fair amount of fungus

1928
01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:21.357
that's installed itself on the body.

1929
01:14:23.357 --> 01:14:25.370
TALIESIN: Let me get a low light going here

1930
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:27.130
that's not going to blast out too much.

1931
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.066
I'm just going to-- a little passive light in here,

1932
01:14:29.066 --> 01:14:30.233
hide under it.

1933
01:14:31.226 --> 01:14:32.375
It's goblin?

1934
01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:34.065
MATT: Make another medicine check, if you'd like.

1935
01:14:34.065 --> 01:14:34.898
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1936
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:37.937
Oh this is terrible, 13.

1937
01:14:37.937 --> 01:14:38.770
MATT: 13.

1938
01:14:40.027 --> 01:14:42.900
Probably anywhere between the six or more months.

1939
01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.733
SAM: Oh.

1940
01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:45.749
TRAVIS: Wow.

1941
01:14:45.749 --> 01:14:47.687
MATT: Just looks like-- in bed?

1942
01:14:47.687 --> 01:14:49.922
MATT: In bed, whatever is there is mostly just skin,

1943
01:14:49.922 --> 01:14:51.983
a lot I just sloughed off into the bed beneath it

1944
01:14:51.983 --> 01:14:54.973
and it's mostly just fungus growing out of it.

1945
01:14:54.973 --> 01:14:56.381
The hide, the eye sockets are empty

1946
01:14:56.381 --> 01:14:57.895
and it just looks kind of

1947
01:14:57.895 --> 01:14:59.941
like the gremlins

1948
01:14:59.941 --> 01:15:00.887
at the end of the movie

1949
01:15:00.887 --> 01:15:02.066
when they start just melting.

1950
01:15:02.066 --> 01:15:04.037
LAURA: That's the actual goblin that worked there.

1951
01:15:04.037 --> 01:15:05.454
TALIESIN: I'm going to just--

1952
01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:09.229
it's on a mattress on the floor?

1953
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:12.309
I'm going to start the process a little further

1954
01:15:12.309 --> 01:15:13.786
since it's already doing so well itself

1955
01:15:13.786 --> 01:15:16.551
and I'm just going to flip the mattress over very quietly.

1956
01:15:16.551 --> 01:15:17.509
MATT: Okay.

1957
01:15:17.509 --> 01:15:19.930
Yeah, actually at the rate it's been,

1958
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:24.260
your Decompose cantrip accelerates it quite a bit

1959
01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.234
and it becomes this briefly like beautiful menagerie

1960
01:15:27.234 --> 01:15:28.817
of colors.

1961
01:15:28.817 --> 01:15:31.001
The the scent gets a little more tolerable

1962
01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:34.291
as the fungus has taken the majority-- the brunt of it now,

1963
01:15:34.291 --> 01:15:36.157
but you go ahead and hide it off to the side

1964
01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:37.695
and it is no longer visible.

1965
01:15:37.695 --> 01:15:41.313
The room is still not a pleasant smell and musky,

1966
01:15:41.313 --> 01:15:42.146
but at least there isn't

1967
01:15:42.146 --> 01:15:43.750
that source immediately in your face.

1968
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:46.436
TALIESIN: Looking around, don't see anything else in here?

1969
01:15:46.436 --> 01:15:47.548
It's just kind of--

1970
01:15:47.548 --> 01:15:49.546
MATT: What are you looking for?

1971
01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:51.889
TALIESIN: Anything from items in the house,

1972
01:15:51.889 --> 01:15:55.806
to maybe a basement or anything like that,

1973
01:15:57.113 --> 01:15:58.048
something in the roof?

1974
01:15:58.048 --> 01:16:00.215
MATT: Make a perception check.

1975
01:16:03.928 --> 01:16:05.136
TALIESIN: 12.

1976
01:16:05.136 --> 01:16:06.531
MATT: All right, looking up,

1977
01:16:06.531 --> 01:16:09.241
there's not really a roof section.

1978
01:16:09.241 --> 01:16:11.914
There are rafters and it's an open space

1979
01:16:11.914 --> 01:16:14.633
before the actual thatched roof begins,

1980
01:16:14.633 --> 01:16:16.892
but there are rafters.

1981
01:16:16.892 --> 01:16:18.217
Between the bed, the table,

1982
01:16:18.217 --> 01:16:20.891
looks to be a couple of small boxes

1983
01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:22.791
that are partially open

1984
01:16:22.791 --> 01:16:24.307
that have had fruit in there,

1985
01:16:24.307 --> 01:16:26.796
but the fruit is now extremely molded.

1986
01:16:26.796 --> 01:16:30.623
This was a simple home with a solitary goblin

1987
01:16:30.623 --> 01:16:32.667
that just lived through the rest of its days

1988
01:16:32.667 --> 01:16:35.395
and no one seemed to miss it when it passed.

1989
01:16:35.395 --> 01:16:36.574
LIAM: I'm going to pull out the wire

1990
01:16:36.574 --> 01:16:41.341
and say to Nott: Is there room for all of us in there,

1991
01:16:41.341 --> 01:16:43.192
and is there a decent view of the Overcrow?

1992
01:16:43.192 --> 01:16:45.832
SAM: Yes, there is, yes there is.

1993
01:16:45.832 --> 01:16:48.521
Come, but do it stealthily.

1994
01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:50.091
TALIESIN: It occurs to me we could have--

1995
01:16:50.091 --> 01:16:51.341
no, never mind.

1996
01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:54.790
Could unlock the front door.

1997
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:56.268
MARISHA: I lean in the window.

1998
01:16:56.268 --> 01:16:57.101
SAM: Oh, you're here, too?

1999
01:16:57.101 --> 01:16:59.279
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm still looking out.

2000
01:16:59.279 --> 01:17:00.633
I'm scouting.

2001
01:17:00.633 --> 01:17:02.626
I'm still being lookout, but--

2002
01:17:02.626 --> 01:17:04.294
maybe we should have two groups,

2003
01:17:04.294 --> 01:17:05.508
half of us stay here

2004
01:17:05.508 --> 01:17:07.092
and then half stay on the opposite side

2005
01:17:07.092 --> 01:17:08.500
so we can see if he comes from the back.

2006
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.468
SAM: Yes.

2007
01:17:09.468 --> 01:17:12.848
We should have Caleb go on the other side, unfortunately,

2008
01:17:12.848 --> 01:17:13.681
or me.

2009
01:17:13.681 --> 01:17:15.558
MARISHA: You stay here, we go.

2010
01:17:15.558 --> 01:17:17.142
Caleb goes on the other side with the bubble

2011
01:17:17.142 --> 01:17:19.074
because he's got to stay in the bubble, right?

2012
01:17:19.074 --> 01:17:22.052
LIAM: You and I are going to do a thing though before bedtime.

2013
01:17:22.052 --> 01:17:23.760
LAURA: Yeah, definitely.

2014
01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.796
We could do it now.

2015
01:17:24.796 --> 01:17:25.629
LIAM: Well, yeah.

2016
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:28.195
Let's try to join the others where they're hiding

2017
01:17:28.195 --> 01:17:31.275
so that we can not be seen when we change you.

2018
01:17:31.275 --> 01:17:32.913
LAURA: Okay, let's be sneaky.

2019
01:17:32.913 --> 01:17:34.920
I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us

2020
01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.858
as we go over to the house.

2021
01:17:37.858 --> 01:17:38.691
LIAM: Okay.

2022
01:17:38.691 --> 01:17:39.524
MATT: All right.

2023
01:17:39.524 --> 01:17:41.252
We have Caleb and Jester and Fjord,

2024
01:17:41.252 --> 01:17:43.085
are you going with them as well?

2025
01:17:43.085 --> 01:17:46.275
TRAVIS: I'm a little confused on where everybody is.

2026
01:17:47.183 --> 01:17:49.878
MATT: We have-- half of the group is in there.

2027
01:17:49.878 --> 01:17:51.711
MARISHA: Me, I'm looking out.

2028
01:17:53.263 --> 01:17:55.440
Nott and Caduceus are inside.

2029
01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.041
Then I don't know where you all are.

2030
01:17:57.041 --> 01:17:58.064
TRAVIS: Yasha--

2031
01:17:58.064 --> 01:17:59.206
SAM: I'm with you.

2032
01:17:59.206 --> 01:18:01.761
We're all kind of over there

2033
01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:02.594
MATT: Down the street,

2034
01:18:02.594 --> 01:18:03.929
you're just watching on the side

2035
01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:05.108
until you decide where to go.

2036
01:18:05.108 --> 01:18:06.235
MARISHA: I'm going to--

2037
01:18:06.235 --> 01:18:08.902
I'm lingering back here.

2038
01:18:13.748 --> 01:18:15.906
LIAM: We're going to group there,

2039
01:18:15.906 --> 01:18:19.736
talk out what we're doing before bed and split.

2040
01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:22.323
TRAVIS: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's good.

2041
01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:25.665
LIAM: Okay, so our group needs to stealth check.

2042
01:18:25.665 --> 01:18:26.498
MATT: Yes, you do.

2043
01:18:26.498 --> 01:18:27.635
But you do get plus ten

2044
01:18:27.635 --> 01:18:30.576
because Pass Without a Trace.

2045
01:18:30.576 --> 01:18:31.743
LIAM: Hot diggity.

2046
01:18:36.857 --> 01:18:37.815
TRAVIS:13.

2047
01:18:37.815 --> 01:18:39.889
MATT: With the plus ten?

2048
01:18:39.889 --> 01:18:40.722
MARISHA: Oof.

2049
01:18:40.722 --> 01:18:41.555
MATT: All righty.

2050
01:18:41.555 --> 01:18:42.388
LIAM: 30.

2051
01:18:42.388 --> 01:18:43.221
MATT: Better.

2052
01:18:43.221 --> 01:18:44.116
LAURA: 24.

2053
01:18:44.116 --> 01:18:44.949
MATT: All right.

2054
01:18:44.949 --> 01:18:45.782
ASHLEY: 23.

2055
01:18:45.782 --> 01:18:46.615
MATT: Okay.

2056
01:18:46.615 --> 01:18:47.448
As a group check,

2057
01:18:47.448 --> 01:18:49.344
they manage to catch you

2058
01:18:49.344 --> 01:18:52.404
as you about to trip on a heavy rock and

2059
01:18:52.404 --> 01:18:53.480
sticking out of the center of the ground

2060
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.044
and you almost go face-first in the thoroughfare.

2061
01:18:55.044 --> 01:18:56.894
And they just swoop you up before you impact

2062
01:18:56.894 --> 01:19:00.110
and carry on like it was nothing.

2063
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:01.749
The four of you make your way over

2064
01:19:01.749 --> 01:19:05.015
to the the abandoned complex--

2065
01:19:05.015 --> 01:19:06.328
very small complex,

2066
01:19:06.328 --> 01:19:08.510
abandoned building where the rest of your party is

2067
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.744
and you saunter up to the side of the window,

2068
01:19:10.744 --> 01:19:13.548
you guys watch the rest of the party approach.

2069
01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:15.286
LIAM: Let's get inside.

2070
01:19:15.286 --> 01:19:16.119
MATT: Okay.

2071
01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:18.387
You're all now hiding within the building.

2072
01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:21.446
TRAVIS: Who is responsible for that smell?

2073
01:19:21.446 --> 01:19:25.072
TALIESIN: The previous tenant is still underneath the mattress.

2074
01:19:25.072 --> 01:19:25.952
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.

2075
01:19:25.952 --> 01:19:26.785
SAM: Okay.

2076
01:19:26.785 --> 01:19:28.065
We all need to sleep,

2077
01:19:28.065 --> 01:19:30.651
but two of us need to stay on lookout.

2078
01:19:30.651 --> 01:19:33.660
One at this side of the house

2079
01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.001
and one in the alley side at all times.

2080
01:19:36.001 --> 01:19:38.041
We need at least three and three.

2081
01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.272
LIAM: Also, before we do that,

2082
01:19:39.272 --> 01:19:41.862
I really want to get a lay of the inside of that building.

2083
01:19:41.862 --> 01:19:42.950
Jester had an idea

2084
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:46.142
that I wish to layer upon.

2085
01:19:47.154 --> 01:19:49.331
She can turn into something small,

2086
01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:52.111
something like a moth or something quiet

2087
01:19:52.111 --> 01:19:54.468
and I will make you invisible

2088
01:19:54.468 --> 01:19:55.700
and I will do one other thing

2089
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.896
that will help you.

2090
01:19:56.896 --> 01:19:57.729
LAURA: Okay.

2091
01:19:58.604 --> 01:19:59.437
LIAM: Okay?

2092
01:19:59.437 --> 01:20:00.270
LAURA: Okay.

2093
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:02.494
LIAM: Then you fly and crawl and we'll wait.

2094
01:20:02.494 --> 01:20:04.533
LAURA: I'll come back and tell you what I see.

2095
01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:05.398
LIAM: Yeah.

2096
01:20:05.398 --> 01:20:06.542
LAURA: No problem.

2097
01:20:06.542 --> 01:20:07.375
LIAM: Can we do that?

2098
01:20:07.375 --> 01:20:08.208
SAM: Sure.
TRAVIS: Go for it.

2099
01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:10.279
LIAM: All right, I'm going to do it all.

2100
01:20:10.279 --> 01:20:11.969
I pull out the cocoon

2101
01:20:11.969 --> 01:20:14.302
and turn Jester into a

2102
01:20:14.302 --> 01:20:17.568
small goth moth.
LAURA: Wait, you're doing it all?

2103
01:20:17.568 --> 01:20:19.924
A small goth moth.
MATT: Small goth moth.

2104
01:20:19.924 --> 01:20:21.590
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Small goth moth.

2105
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:22.741
LIAM: Blue and black.

2106
01:20:22.741 --> 01:20:23.891
LAURA: That's cute.

2107
01:20:23.891 --> 01:20:26.829
In my head, I think I'm really cute.

2108
01:20:26.829 --> 01:20:28.822
MATT: An adorable tiny goth moth.

2109
01:20:28.822 --> 01:20:32.080
TALIESIN: (intones a bass line)

2110
01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.988
LAURA: I land on Yasha's finger.

2111
01:20:34.988 --> 01:20:37.521
TRAVIS: (slapping)
ASHLEY: I bite.

2112
01:20:37.521 --> 01:20:39.725
LAURA: In my head I'm like,

2113
01:20:39.725 --> 01:20:41.782
I never realized how beautiful light was before.

2114
01:20:41.782 --> 01:20:42.857
MATT: This is with Polymorph right?

2115
01:20:42.857 --> 01:20:43.690
LIAM: Yes.

2116
01:20:43.690 --> 01:20:44.523
MATT: Okay.

2117
01:20:44.523 --> 01:20:45.356
LIAM: Polymorph.

2118
01:20:45.356 --> 01:20:46.569
And then while she's flitting about,

2119
01:20:46.569 --> 01:20:49.117
I will cast Invisibility on her.

2120
01:20:49.117 --> 01:20:50.196
Now she's invisible,

2121
01:20:50.196 --> 01:20:51.657
I can't see her exactly,

2122
01:20:51.657 --> 01:20:53.628
but I pull out the valuable pole

2123
01:20:53.628 --> 01:20:55.106
that I use for fine familiar

2124
01:20:55.106 --> 01:20:59.065
and start weaving geometric patterns around it muttering

2125
01:20:59.065 --> 01:21:02.076
and a small mote of light floats out of it

2126
01:21:02.076 --> 01:21:04.521
and touches an invisible moth

2127
01:21:04.521 --> 01:21:07.579
and you have just been touched by this spell

2128
01:21:07.579 --> 01:21:10.121
Fortune's Favor, which is dunamancy.

2129
01:21:10.121 --> 01:21:11.557
SAM: Ooh, what does that do?

2130
01:21:11.557 --> 01:21:15.652
LIAM: You now have one chance to redo,

2131
01:21:15.652 --> 01:21:16.998
like with the dodecahedron.

2132
01:21:16.998 --> 01:21:18.900
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2133
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:19.869
TRAVIS: Fortune's fancy.

2134
01:21:19.869 --> 01:21:21.246
SAM: Fortune's Favor.

2135
01:21:21.246 --> 01:21:22.636
LIAM: Fortune's Favor.

2136
01:21:22.636 --> 01:21:23.900
But it is fancy.

2137
01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.380
ASHLEY: It's very fancy.

2138
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.661
LAURA: What is he looking up?

2139
01:21:26.661 --> 01:21:27.737
He's looking up something.

2140
01:21:27.737 --> 01:21:29.606
SAM: Whether you can stack moth things?

2141
01:21:29.606 --> 01:21:32.135
MATT: No, I'm not against stacking.

2142
01:21:32.135 --> 01:21:34.055
LIAM: Oh, Polymorph and Invisibility

2143
01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:34.897
are both concentration.

2144
01:21:34.897 --> 01:21:35.730
LAURA: That's okay.

2145
01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:36.938
I can polymorph myself.

2146
01:21:36.938 --> 01:21:38.192
So I polymorph myself.

2147
01:21:38.192 --> 01:21:39.421
That's what I was planning to do, anyway.

2148
01:21:39.421 --> 01:21:40.884
LIAM: I'm dumb, but Caleb's not.

2149
01:21:40.884 --> 01:21:42.790
So he would know that.

2150
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:44.207
LAURA: I do Polymorph.

2151
01:21:45.156 --> 01:21:47.763
Yeah, and then you can Invisibility me.

2152
01:21:47.763 --> 01:21:50.103
MATT: All right. So you become a moth.

2153
01:21:50.103 --> 01:21:51.912
You're a moth.

2154
01:21:53.145 --> 01:21:54.911
A-flutter.

2155
01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:56.326
LAURA: Oh, like I'm stupid?

2156
01:21:56.326 --> 01:21:57.981
MATT: You have an intelligence of one.

2157
01:21:57.981 --> 01:22:00.948
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2158
01:22:01.991 --> 01:22:05.716
Yes, that's what I was waiting for!

2159
01:22:05.716 --> 01:22:07.173
TALIESIN: It's even better.

2160
01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:08.358
It's now an invisible moth.

2161
01:22:09.208 --> 01:22:11.041
LIAM: Okay go, now you go.

2162
01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.514
LAURA: I go.

2163
01:22:13.514 --> 01:22:14.957
LIAM: She must have gone, I don't see her.

2164
01:22:14.957 --> 01:22:16.423
MATT: She goes outside.

2165
01:22:16.423 --> 01:22:17.989
LAURA: Fly.

2166
01:22:17.989 --> 01:22:20.628
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck.

2167
01:22:20.628 --> 01:22:22.933
MATT: You still know what you were doing.
LAURA: I do?

2168
01:22:22.933 --> 01:22:24.862
You don't forget your whole previous life.

2169
01:22:24.862 --> 01:22:27.062
LAURA: I don't forget that I'm Jester?

2170
01:22:27.062 --> 01:22:27.907
MATT: You don't forget you're Jester.

2171
01:22:27.907 --> 01:22:29.561
You're just in this moment,

2172
01:22:29.561 --> 01:22:30.582
you're more limited.
LIAM: Help me remember

2173
01:22:30.582 --> 01:22:31.814
when Keyleth changed into things?

2174
01:22:31.814 --> 01:22:33.081
That's different, right, that's beast shape?

2175
01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:34.296
MARISHA: Beast shape let's you keep your--

2176
01:22:34.296 --> 01:22:36.619
MATT: So wild shape you keep your intellectual scores.

2177
01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:37.577
Polymorph does not.

2178
01:22:37.577 --> 01:22:39.857
TALIESIN: We learn things every day.

2179
01:22:39.857 --> 01:22:42.274
SAM: But you keep your memories?

2180
01:22:43.131 --> 01:22:44.064
You just are dumb?

2181
01:22:44.064 --> 01:22:45.206
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2182
01:22:45.206 --> 01:22:46.039
SAM: Okay.

2183
01:22:46.039 --> 01:22:47.548
SAM: So she's super dumb right now.

2184
01:22:47.548 --> 01:22:48.444
LAURA: I'm super dumb, but I'm like,

2185
01:22:48.444 --> 01:22:49.975
I'm supposed to go look at things.

2186
01:22:49.975 --> 01:22:52.494
TRAVIS: I think an intelligence of one matches the record

2187
01:22:52.494 --> 01:22:54.623
of our entire show.

2188
01:22:54.623 --> 01:22:56.198
I think I either hit one or zero once.

2189
01:22:56.198 --> 01:22:57.763
LAURA: When I fly, I'm like--

2190
01:22:57.763 --> 01:22:59.387
(laughter)

2191
01:22:59.387 --> 01:23:01.928
MATT: I will say, for the purposes of this,

2192
01:23:01.928 --> 01:23:05.178
just roll an intelligence check for me.

2193
01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:07.731
MATT: It's minus five.

2194
01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:11.973
LAURA: Minus five?

2195
01:23:11.973 --> 01:23:12.806
MATT: Yes.

2196
01:23:12.806 --> 01:23:13.639
LIAM: Nine.

2197
01:23:13.639 --> 01:23:14.722
MATT: Okay.

2198
01:23:14.722 --> 01:23:17.129
It takes you about 20 or so minutes

2199
01:23:17.129 --> 01:23:20.053
to eventually find your way across the thoroughfare.

2200
01:23:20.053 --> 01:23:23.197
You're easily distracted and there are lights

2201
01:23:23.197 --> 01:23:24.813
and flickers, like, ooh, light.

2202
01:23:24.813 --> 01:23:26.371
TRAVIS: Like a moth to the flame.

2203
01:23:26.371 --> 01:23:27.496
LAURA: It's so pretty.

2204
01:23:27.496 --> 01:23:29.515
MATT: But you remind yourself,

2205
01:23:29.515 --> 01:23:31.497
in your very limited capability,

2206
01:23:31.497 --> 01:23:32.604
to get back on track

2207
01:23:32.604 --> 01:23:34.456
and you're distracted again

2208
01:23:34.456 --> 01:23:36.249
and you're all just sitting there waiting

2209
01:23:36.249 --> 01:23:39.146
and waiting and waiting and waiting.

2210
01:23:39.146 --> 01:23:41.371
Until about half an hour in

2211
01:23:41.371 --> 01:23:46.371
you eventually land and you're like, "This is a nice roof."

2212
01:23:46.387 --> 01:23:50.259
LAURA: Do I remember to make my way over to a window?

2213
01:23:50.259 --> 01:23:52.881
MATT: There was the shuttered window with the curtains.

2214
01:23:52.881 --> 01:23:54.182
Make another intelligence check for me.

2215
01:23:54.182 --> 01:23:55.662
LAURA: Okay.

2216
01:23:55.662 --> 01:23:58.245
MARISHA: She's going to fly into a torch.

2217
01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.753
LAURA: Ah, zero.

2218
01:24:02.261 --> 01:24:04.037
MATT: All right.

2219
01:24:04.037 --> 01:24:07.190
You go over to where the there are these heavy curtains

2220
01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:08.702
that are currently closed up there

2221
01:24:08.702 --> 01:24:10.587
and you latch onto them

2222
01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:14.617
and just start chewing for a while.

2223
01:24:14.617 --> 01:24:15.816
It's not bad material.

2224
01:24:15.816 --> 01:24:18.850
It's a little musty, but it's tasty.

2225
01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:20.970
TRAVIS: Om om om.

2226
01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:22.361
MATT: Another 20 minutes.

2227
01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:24.297
That's 40 minutes now that you've been a moth.

2228
01:24:24.297 --> 01:24:25.895
TRAVIS: I don't feel like this is going

2229
01:24:25.895 --> 01:24:26.761
the way we meant.

2230
01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:28.083
MATT: Make another intelligence check.

2231
01:24:28.083 --> 01:24:30.019
TRAVIS: It's been going for a bit, though.

2232
01:24:30.019 --> 01:24:31.445
I'm worried.

2233
01:24:31.445 --> 01:24:32.813
LAURA: Eight.

2234
01:24:32.813 --> 01:24:34.065
No, yeah, eight.

2235
01:24:34.065 --> 01:24:35.772
MATT: Minus, this is minus five?

2236
01:24:35.772 --> 01:24:37.585
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: Okay.

2237
01:24:37.585 --> 01:24:40.612
I'll say it takes you about ten minutes or so

2238
01:24:40.612 --> 01:24:42.362
to gather your focus.

2239
01:24:45.934 --> 01:24:48.965
Go ahead and roll a dexterity check for me as well,

2240
01:24:48.965 --> 01:24:50.486
which is a plus one.

2241
01:24:50.486 --> 01:24:51.348
MARISHA: Oh.

2242
01:24:51.348 --> 01:24:52.475
LIAM: This is taking a long time.

2243
01:24:52.475 --> 01:24:53.460
TRAVIS: Something went wrong.

2244
01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.293
LAURA: Eight.

2245
01:24:54.293 --> 01:24:55.876
MATT: Okay.

2246
01:24:55.876 --> 01:24:58.195
You cannot find a way in the window.

2247
01:24:58.195 --> 01:25:00.195
It's closed too tightly,

2248
01:25:01.784 --> 01:25:04.320
even as a moth, unfortunately.

2249
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.903
LAURA: Do I hear anything?

2250
01:25:05.903 --> 01:25:08.475
MATT: Make a perception check.

2251
01:25:08.475 --> 01:25:10.257
Minus two.
SAM: Moth has sick stats.

2252
01:25:10.257 --> 01:25:11.698
LAURA: Five.

2253
01:25:11.698 --> 01:25:14.881
MATT: You don't hear anything.

2254
01:25:14.881 --> 01:25:18.369
LAURA: Oh man, this-- can I chew this curtain some more?

2255
01:25:18.369 --> 01:25:19.294
It's so nice.

2256
01:25:19.294 --> 01:25:20.127
MATT: Yeah.

2257
01:25:21.565 --> 01:25:23.340
TRAVIS: How long does Polymorph last?

2258
01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:24.173
LAURA: An hour.

2259
01:25:24.173 --> 01:25:25.840
MATT: I know, hour for Invisibility

2260
01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.212
and an hour for Polymorph.

2261
01:25:27.212 --> 01:25:28.480
Polymorph was cast first.

2262
01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.313
LAURA: Yeah.

2263
01:25:31.948 --> 01:25:34.090
MATT: Suddenly, you revert to Jester form

2264
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:35.797
and you're like, "What was I doing?"

2265
01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.172
And you're falling.

2266
01:25:38.047 --> 01:25:40.092
And you hit the roof.

2267
01:25:40.092 --> 01:25:41.133
LAURA: Can I grab going to onto the--

2268
01:25:41.133 --> 01:25:43.811
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

2269
01:25:43.811 --> 01:25:46.044
MARISHA: We all see this from the window?

2270
01:25:46.044 --> 01:25:48.880
MATT: Actually, dexterity saving throw for this.

2271
01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:49.758
LAURA: Come on.

2272
01:25:49.758 --> 01:25:50.716
Seven.

2273
01:25:50.716 --> 01:25:52.147
MATT: Seven, you rolled a?

2274
01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.938
LAURA: I rolled a three plus four.

2275
01:25:53.938 --> 01:25:55.102
MATT: Oh I didn't see, there we go.

2276
01:25:55.102 --> 01:25:56.769
All right, you fall,

2277
01:25:57.638 --> 01:26:00.100
you take six points of bludgeoning damage

2278
01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:03.846
as you smash onto one of the boxes in the alley below.

2279
01:26:03.846 --> 01:26:06.105
You have fallen prone there in the corner,

2280
01:26:06.105 --> 01:26:07.830
thankfully invisible still.

2281
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:09.913
But you have like a round

2282
01:26:11.014 --> 01:26:13.587
before your Invisibility wears off.

2283
01:26:13.587 --> 01:26:14.920
You're like--

2284
01:26:15.859 --> 01:26:17.611
LAURA: Can I run and hide in the shadows around the corner?

2285
01:26:17.611 --> 01:26:18.699
LIAM: You've also got that mote.

2286
01:26:18.699 --> 01:26:19.594
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

2287
01:26:19.594 --> 01:26:21.024
SAM: Oh that's true.
LAURA: There's no way

2288
01:26:21.024 --> 01:26:22.539
I would have remembered I had the mote

2289
01:26:22.539 --> 01:26:24.768
when I was fucking--a moth.

2290
01:26:24.768 --> 01:26:26.891
MATT: Right, so it's half of your movement to get up.

2291
01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:27.724
LAURA: Yeah.

2292
01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:31.157
MATT: Five, ten, 15, that's as far as you can go.

2293
01:26:31.157 --> 01:26:36.157
LAURA: Can I use my-- the minute I become visible,

2294
01:26:36.171 --> 01:26:41.141
I'm going to use my thingy to turn invisible again

2295
01:26:41.141 --> 01:26:42.681
for ten more seconds.

2296
01:26:42.681 --> 01:26:44.378
MATT: Okay, you can do that.

2297
01:26:44.378 --> 01:26:45.543
All right.

2298
01:26:45.543 --> 01:26:47.279
That's your movement.

2299
01:26:47.279 --> 01:26:48.384
With your action, you can go ahead

2300
01:26:48.384 --> 01:26:49.608
and-- which way are you going to now?

2301
01:26:49.608 --> 01:26:51.344
LAURA: I'm going to try to duck into

2302
01:26:51.344 --> 01:26:53.822
under that porch or whatever that is.

2303
01:26:53.822 --> 01:26:55.904
MATT: Okay, it's a very tight space.

2304
01:26:55.904 --> 01:26:56.928
You turn over this way.

2305
01:26:56.928 --> 01:26:57.886
The next turn,

2306
01:26:57.886 --> 01:26:59.072
as soon as you finish that round,

2307
01:26:59.072 --> 01:27:00.416
or if you dash over,

2308
01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:01.424
you get over to the space

2309
01:27:01.424 --> 01:27:02.257
and you get out of the corner,

2310
01:27:02.257 --> 01:27:03.501
that's as far as you can move is that corner there.

2311
01:27:03.501 --> 01:27:05.280
Turns over, you become visible

2312
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.678
and you're all of a sudden,

2313
01:27:06.678 --> 01:27:08.653
you're a little bruised, a little beaten.

2314
01:27:08.653 --> 01:27:10.177
Make a perception check.

2315
01:27:10.177 --> 01:27:11.010
LAURA: Oh god.

2316
01:27:15.168 --> 01:27:16.001
LAURA: 17.

2317
01:27:16.001 --> 01:27:16.834
MATT: 17.

2318
01:27:16.834 --> 01:27:18.448
Currently nobody sees you,

2319
01:27:18.448 --> 01:27:20.096
but you can see from the noise

2320
01:27:20.096 --> 01:27:22.368
a shadow coming from inside the hostel.

2321
01:27:22.368 --> 01:27:23.888
Somebody is coming towards the front door

2322
01:27:23.888 --> 01:27:26.192
towards where the noise drew them.

2323
01:27:26.192 --> 01:27:27.025
LAURA: Invisible.

2324
01:27:27.025 --> 01:27:27.904
I turn invisible.

2325
01:27:27.904 --> 01:27:28.737
MATT: You turn invisible

2326
01:27:28.737 --> 01:27:31.195
and you're now on the inside of this corner there.

2327
01:27:31.195 --> 01:27:33.376
There's a less than a foot gap

2328
01:27:33.376 --> 01:27:34.240
between the two buildings

2329
01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.456
that leads into the alleyway there.

2330
01:27:35.456 --> 01:27:36.829
You're not sure if you can try and squeeze by.

2331
01:27:36.829 --> 01:27:37.935
TRAVIS: If we saw her fall,

2332
01:27:37.935 --> 01:27:39.843
did she damage any of the things outside?

2333
01:27:39.843 --> 01:27:41.476
MATT: Oh yeah.
MARISHA: Did we hear ka-klunk?

2334
01:27:41.476 --> 01:27:43.629
MATT: You heard the impact and the breaking of wood.

2335
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:44.463
TRAVIS: All right.

2336
01:27:44.463 --> 01:27:46.963
I want to Misty Step outside

2337
01:27:48.441 --> 01:27:50.128
and I want to use Mask of Many Faces

2338
01:27:50.128 --> 01:27:52.301
to change myself into a drunken peasant

2339
01:27:52.301 --> 01:27:53.904
and I'll use Minor Illusion

2340
01:27:53.904 --> 01:27:55.600
to have a tankard in my hand.

2341
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.328
I want to be right where all the debris was.

2342
01:27:57.328 --> 01:27:58.512
MATT: Great, all right.

2343
01:27:58.512 --> 01:27:59.504
You run past this way,

2344
01:27:59.504 --> 01:28:00.957
then Misty Step over there.

2345
01:28:00.957 --> 01:28:03.293
Transform into-- and describe how you look.

2346
01:28:03.293 --> 01:28:06.710
TRAVIS: Yeah, so a drow, but more like a farmer.

2347
01:28:07.712 --> 01:28:10.028
Like real tatty stuff,

2348
01:28:10.028 --> 01:28:14.028
big, muscular forearms from working so much.

2349
01:28:15.225 --> 01:28:20.225
Just real slovenly stains of food and drink all over me

2350
01:28:20.384 --> 01:28:24.688
and just laying up against the debris

2351
01:28:24.688 --> 01:28:25.712
humming a little tune.

2352
01:28:25.712 --> 01:28:26.832
MATT: You got it, you got it.

2353
01:28:26.832 --> 01:28:28.415
Okay then.

2354
01:28:28.415 --> 01:28:30.816
We have, over here, an invisible Jester

2355
01:28:30.816 --> 01:28:32.403
who's off in the corner.

2356
01:28:32.403 --> 01:28:35.023
As you are in that process

2357
01:28:35.023 --> 01:28:36.656
of getting yourself in position,

2358
01:28:36.656 --> 01:28:37.679
taking the form,

2359
01:28:37.679 --> 01:28:40.929
you watch as this rough looking

2360
01:28:42.302 --> 01:28:47.248
half-drunk, large underbite growling gnoll

2361
01:28:47.248 --> 01:28:48.671
comes outside at the front of the hostel

2362
01:28:48.671 --> 01:28:51.088
and is like-- (unhappy panting)

2363
01:28:51.088 --> 01:28:53.843
TRAVIS: (drunken giggling)

2364
01:28:53.843 --> 01:28:55.093
MATT: "What you doing?!"

2365
01:28:55.093 --> 01:28:56.806
TRAVIS: I fell-- (drunken giggling)

2366
01:28:56.806 --> 01:28:57.697
MATT: (snorting)

2367
01:28:57.697 --> 01:28:59.407
TRAVIS: I fell down!

2368
01:28:59.407 --> 01:29:00.873
MATT: Make a deception check with advantage.

2369
01:29:00.873 --> 01:29:03.206
SAM: Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2370
01:29:05.947 --> 01:29:07.505
TRAVIS: 20.

2371
01:29:07.505 --> 01:29:10.239
MATT: He goes, "Okay, fuck off."

2372
01:29:10.239 --> 01:29:12.037
TRAVIS: (drunken giggling)

2373
01:29:12.037 --> 01:29:14.299
MATT: He comes up and grabs the back of your shirt

2374
01:29:14.299 --> 01:29:15.376
and lifts you.

2375
01:29:15.376 --> 01:29:17.209
It doesn't quite match.

2376
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:19.121
SAM: Uh-oh.
TRAVIS: He's kind of drunk.

2377
01:29:19.121 --> 01:29:21.846
MATT: But he rolled a natural two. So he doesn't notice.

2378
01:29:21.846 --> 01:29:23.847
He grabs it lifts you up a bit

2379
01:29:23.847 --> 01:29:28.344
and walks a few steps and just throws you about ten feet.

2380
01:29:28.344 --> 01:29:31.467
You roll across and laid out there.

2381
01:29:31.467 --> 01:29:35.083
TRAVIS: You're strong. (drunken giggling)

2382
01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:36.174
(drunken caterwauling)

2383
01:29:36.174 --> 01:29:38.678
MATT: "They think they're so superior; look at this piss."

2384
01:29:38.678 --> 01:29:40.419
TRAVIS: (drunken caterwauling continues)

2385
01:29:40.419 --> 01:29:42.656
MATT: Turns around and lumbers back to the hostel

2386
01:29:42.656 --> 01:29:44.125
and heads back inside.

2387
01:29:44.125 --> 01:29:46.291
TRAVIS: (more drunken caterwauling)

2388
01:29:46.291 --> 01:29:47.864
MATT: Your Invisibility is wearing off now.

2389
01:29:47.864 --> 01:29:49.754
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: You're still in that corner.

2390
01:29:49.754 --> 01:29:50.670
What are you going to do?

2391
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:52.596
LAURA: Cast Disguise Self

2392
01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:56.180
to look like a goblin.

2393
01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:57.371
MATT: Okay.

2394
01:29:57.371 --> 01:29:59.216
As soon as that gnoll turns the corner

2395
01:29:59.216 --> 01:30:00.507
and the Invisibility drops,

2396
01:30:00.507 --> 01:30:01.812
you turn into a goblin.

2397
01:30:01.812 --> 01:30:03.008
He enters and you can see him

2398
01:30:03.008 --> 01:30:06.178
disappearing into the very faint source of light.

2399
01:30:06.178 --> 01:30:07.917
Inside, you see a shadow cross paths on the wall

2400
01:30:07.917 --> 01:30:09.543
on the opposite end of the entryway.

2401
01:30:09.543 --> 01:30:10.829
Now you're a goblin.

2402
01:30:10.829 --> 01:30:15.737
TRAVIS: I will start serpentine walking away from the house just

2403
01:30:15.737 --> 01:30:17.645
(drunken caterwauling)

2404
01:30:17.645 --> 01:30:20.368
TRAVIS: As Fjord walks back in, I'm just-- (applause)

2405
01:30:20.368 --> 01:30:22.238
TRAVIS: Actually, I'll do a wide loop back to you guys.

2406
01:30:22.238 --> 01:30:25.584
Yeah, not walking back to the house directly.

2407
01:30:25.584 --> 01:30:26.925
MATT: You make your way eventually slowly over that way

2408
01:30:26.925 --> 01:30:28.463
and Jester, you're heading over there as well?

2409
01:30:28.463 --> 01:30:29.744
LAURA: Yeah, but roundabout.

2410
01:30:29.744 --> 01:30:30.736
MATT: Okay.

2411
01:30:30.736 --> 01:30:34.448
I'll say you have a luxury of a few moments here

2412
01:30:34.448 --> 01:30:36.048
to scatter it a bit

2413
01:30:36.048 --> 01:30:36.881
and not draw any attention,

2414
01:30:36.881 --> 01:30:39.493
but eventually you all reconvene back at the house.

2415
01:30:39.493 --> 01:30:40.941
MARISHA: That was fucking funny.

2416
01:30:40.941 --> 01:30:43.054
SAM: What did you find out about the inside?

2417
01:30:43.054 --> 01:30:45.104
LAURA: Oh my god, you guys.

2418
01:30:45.104 --> 01:30:46.156
LIAM: What did you see, anything?

2419
01:30:46.156 --> 01:30:47.920
LAURA: I saw so many like--

2420
01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.435
TRAVIS: What took so long?

2421
01:30:49.435 --> 01:30:50.368
You were gone for like an hour.

2422
01:30:50.368 --> 01:30:51.503
ASHLEY: Were you in there for so long?

2423
01:30:51.503 --> 01:30:53.381
LAURA: You guys,

2424
01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:55.434
did you know when you turn into something,

2425
01:30:55.434 --> 01:30:57.822
you turn really stupid?

2426
01:30:57.822 --> 01:30:59.412
TRAVIS: Into anything?

2427
01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:00.515
LAURA: I don't know.

2428
01:31:00.515 --> 01:31:02.329
I was really stupid.

2429
01:31:02.329 --> 01:31:04.160
TRAVIS: What did you do for that whole time?

2430
01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.151
Did you go inside?

2431
01:31:05.151 --> 01:31:06.143
LAURA: I don't know.

2432
01:31:06.143 --> 01:31:08.493
I flew around, and I--

2433
01:31:08.493 --> 01:31:11.520
and there was like a puddle and I landed next to it

2434
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:14.784
and I think I might have drank from it.

2435
01:31:14.784 --> 01:31:17.262
MATT: There's a bit of it a stale aftertaste in your mouth.

2436
01:31:17.262 --> 01:31:19.277
TALIESIN: I smell Velveteen on your breath.

2437
01:31:19.277 --> 01:31:20.110
LAURA: Oh man.

2438
01:31:21.133 --> 01:31:22.240
Then I tried to get in,

2439
01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.152
but like there was a heavy curtain and some shutters

2440
01:31:25.152 --> 01:31:27.696
and I didn't know what to do.

2441
01:31:27.696 --> 01:31:30.785
So I just ate some curtain and then--

2442
01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:31.985
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2443
01:31:33.547 --> 01:31:35.158
LIAM: A valuable lesson for Caleb.

2444
01:31:35.158 --> 01:31:36.558
SAM: All right.

2445
01:31:36.558 --> 01:31:38.848
TALIESIN: I think we all learned something tonight.

2446
01:31:38.848 --> 01:31:41.072
LAURA: But Fjord, thank you so much.

2447
01:31:41.072 --> 01:31:42.730
I was freaking out just a little bit.

2448
01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:44.563
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, it's fine.

2449
01:31:45.474 --> 01:31:47.474
Look out for each other.

2450
01:31:48.382 --> 01:31:50.496
All right, so who's staying on this side?

2451
01:31:50.496 --> 01:31:52.878
SAM: Wait, are we going to try to infiltrate?

2452
01:31:52.878 --> 01:31:54.528
LIAM: We just burned an hour

2453
01:31:54.528 --> 01:31:56.336
and we know nothing about the inside of that building.

2454
01:31:56.336 --> 01:31:57.629
SAM: Shall we sleep and scout?

2455
01:31:57.629 --> 01:31:58.910
Sleep and look out?

2456
01:31:58.910 --> 01:32:01.024
TRAVIS: The three on the other side

2457
01:32:01.024 --> 01:32:02.288
should sleep on the other side as well.

2458
01:32:02.288 --> 01:32:04.061
SAM: For sure.
ASHLEY: I can go to the other side.

2459
01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:05.136
TRAVIS: I'll go there as well.

2460
01:32:05.136 --> 01:32:07.021
ASHLEY: I don't want to sleep in here with the smell.

2461
01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.384
TALIESIN: I don't mind the smell.

2462
01:32:08.384 --> 01:32:09.217
LIAM: I don't mind.

2463
01:32:09.217 --> 01:32:11.259
LAURA: I'll sleep on the other side.

2464
01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:12.816
You should have a cleric with you.

2465
01:32:12.816 --> 01:32:13.872
TALIESIN: Yeah, that makes sense.

2466
01:32:13.872 --> 01:32:16.537
MARISHA: Yeah, so that we can communicate.

2467
01:32:16.537 --> 01:32:18.384
You have to go in there anyway

2468
01:32:18.384 --> 01:32:21.211
if you're going to make the dome, right?

2469
01:32:21.211 --> 01:32:22.169
LIAM: Yeah.

2470
01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:23.760
LAURA: Well, that's everybody's there

2471
01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.072
except for Beau and Nott.

2472
01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:26.448
TRAVIS: Never mind, I'll stay over here, I don't care.

2473
01:32:26.448 --> 01:32:29.640
MATT: Okay, so who's staying where?

2474
01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:30.912
SAM: We don't know where we're sleeping

2475
01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:31.745
on the other side.

2476
01:32:31.745 --> 01:32:32.578
LAURA: No.

2477
01:32:32.578 --> 01:32:33.661
MARISHA: No, we've got to figure that out.

2478
01:32:33.661 --> 01:32:36.980
SAM: But we can't make a dome in the middle of the street.

2479
01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.089
LAURA: You can't make a dome.
MARISHA: Camouflage it.

2480
01:32:39.089 --> 01:32:40.508
LAURA: No, it's a dome.

2481
01:32:40.508 --> 01:32:43.456
LIAM: You can affect its color, that's it.

2482
01:32:43.456 --> 01:32:45.248
TALIESIN: Or we can sleep up on a roof?

2483
01:32:45.248 --> 01:32:46.317
MARISHA: Or just sleep on the roof.

2484
01:32:46.317 --> 01:32:48.749
LAURA: Yeah, but the roofs are very peaked, you guys.

2485
01:32:48.749 --> 01:32:49.774
How are we going to sleep

2486
01:32:49.774 --> 01:32:50.750
on them?
TRAVIS: All right, let's sleep

2487
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:51.583
in this house.

2488
01:32:51.583 --> 01:32:53.184
LIAM: Yeah, if we do it here the dome could be hidden

2489
01:32:53.184 --> 01:32:54.017
in this house, too.

2490
01:32:54.017 --> 01:32:56.304
MATT: Okay, so everyone is sleeping in this house?

2491
01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:57.501
TALIESIN: Yeah, in the dome.

2492
01:32:57.501 --> 01:32:58.576
MATT: All righty.

2493
01:32:58.576 --> 01:33:01.624
LAURA: Maybe you can make Frumpkin invisible and go in.

2494
01:33:01.624 --> 01:33:03.712
LIAM: Frumpkin could not get past a door.

2495
01:33:03.712 --> 01:33:04.688
MATT: But you guys have shared--

2496
01:33:04.688 --> 01:33:08.224
MARISHA: Could Frumpkin be are alley for us?

2497
01:33:08.224 --> 01:33:09.494
Can he be team alley?

2498
01:33:09.494 --> 01:33:10.327
LIAM: Yeah.

2499
01:33:10.327 --> 01:33:13.588
TRAVIS: But Frumpkin can only notify him if--

2500
01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.961
SAM: Oh, how about this? How about this?

2501
01:33:15.961 --> 01:33:17.212
If we're going to go to sleep,

2502
01:33:17.212 --> 01:33:19.895
why don't you do your silly string

2503
01:33:19.895 --> 01:33:22.780
around her back window?

2504
01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:24.171
If anyone goes in the back window,

2505
01:33:24.171 --> 01:33:25.274
we'll know about it.

2506
01:33:25.274 --> 01:33:27.212
LIAM: Was the window on the first floor or above?

2507
01:33:27.212 --> 01:33:29.628
SAM: First floor.
LIAM: Okay.

2508
01:33:29.628 --> 01:33:31.337
TRAVIS: That also means going right up to the building.

2509
01:33:31.337 --> 01:33:32.295
LIAM: Yeah.

2510
01:33:32.295 --> 01:33:33.128
SAM: Don't worry,

2511
01:33:33.128 --> 01:33:33.961
you can be invisible.
TALIESIN: Who's going to enter

2512
01:33:33.961 --> 01:33:34.873
through the back window?

2513
01:33:34.873 --> 01:33:35.831
LIAM: That's true.

2514
01:33:35.831 --> 01:33:37.820
SAM: Well, that's the only any thing we have to worry about.

2515
01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:39.852
Otherwise we can see whoever goes in and out.

2516
01:33:39.852 --> 01:33:40.716
TALIESIN: I don't think they're going to.

2517
01:33:40.716 --> 01:33:42.700
SAM: All right. You want to just chance it,

2518
01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:43.592
we'll just go to sleep.

2519
01:33:43.592 --> 01:33:45.325
TRAVIS: It's just a window back there? There's no door?

2520
01:33:45.325 --> 01:33:46.225
SAM: Just a window, right?

2521
01:33:46.225 --> 01:33:47.316
MATT: Yep.

2522
01:33:47.316 --> 01:33:48.307
SAM: We can just chance it.

2523
01:33:48.307 --> 01:33:49.966
That's fine with me.

2524
01:33:52.682 --> 01:33:55.388
LAURA: I bet he's just going to teleport in, you guys.

2525
01:33:55.388 --> 01:33:56.221
SAM: Let's sleep.

2526
01:33:56.221 --> 01:33:58.289
MARISHA: He might teleport in.

2527
01:33:58.289 --> 01:33:59.868
SAM: No problem.
LIAM: No, I like your idea.

2528
01:33:59.868 --> 01:34:01.251
Let's just be safe.

2529
01:34:01.251 --> 01:34:02.556
I'll go invisible

2530
01:34:02.556 --> 01:34:05.410
and I will put a wire over there.

2531
01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:07.036
SAM: You can do it while you're invisible?

2532
01:34:07.036 --> 01:34:08.988
It doesn't break the Invisibility or anything?

2533
01:34:08.988 --> 01:34:10.604
MATT: Casting a spell does break Invisibility.

2534
01:34:10.604 --> 01:34:12.380
LIAM: Oh any spell, not attack spell?

2535
01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.468
MATT: Casting any spell breaks it.

2536
01:34:13.468 --> 01:34:14.301
LIAM: Okay.

2537
01:34:14.301 --> 01:34:16.753
LAURA: I can go with you and cast Pass Without a Trace on us

2538
01:34:16.753 --> 01:34:19.104
and then, you know--

2539
01:34:19.104 --> 01:34:20.070
SAM: It's not worth it.

2540
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:21.298
LAURA: -- and then give you,

2541
01:34:21.298 --> 01:34:22.473
and I can bless you with the tricks--

2542
01:34:22.473 --> 01:34:23.820
I can give you the Blessing of the Trickster

2543
01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:25.276
and you could be even better.

2544
01:34:25.276 --> 01:34:26.748
LIAM: I will send Frumpkin over

2545
01:34:26.748 --> 01:34:28.748
and just have him come alert us if anything changes.

2546
01:34:28.748 --> 01:34:30.852
MATT: All right, Frumpkin--

2547
01:34:30.852 --> 01:34:31.979
SAM: That's our lookout.

2548
01:34:31.979 --> 01:34:36.979
LIAM: Yeah, he'll sit on a crook of a roof or something.

2549
01:34:37.052 --> 01:34:38.220
MATT: There's Frumpkin.

2550
01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:39.862
TALIESIN: Who's taking first shift?

2551
01:34:39.862 --> 01:34:41.033
MARISHA: I'll take first shift.

2552
01:34:41.033 --> 01:34:42.363
LIAM: I will, too, since Frumpkin's out.

2553
01:34:42.363 --> 01:34:43.196
TALIESIN: All right.

2554
01:34:43.196 --> 01:34:44.529
LAURA: I'm going to sleep.

2555
01:34:44.529 --> 01:34:46.112
SAM: I need to sleep.

2556
01:34:46.112 --> 01:34:47.547
MARISHA: Take one window, I'll take the other.

2557
01:34:47.547 --> 01:34:50.908
MATT: So Caleb and Beau are the two keeping watch?

2558
01:34:50.908 --> 01:34:51.900
Everyone else is sleeping?

2559
01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.860
LAURA: Yep.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2560
01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:54.318
MATT: All right.

2561
01:34:54.318 --> 01:34:58.100
Taking in shifts of two, three hours, what are you doing?

2562
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.975
TRAVIS: Two and a half.

2563
01:34:59.975 --> 01:35:01.084
MARISHA: Yeah, we need eight.

2564
01:35:01.084 --> 01:35:03.068
We need, like, an eight hour rest right?

2565
01:35:03.068 --> 01:35:06.277
MATT: Eight hour rest and that'll be ten hours total

2566
01:35:06.277 --> 01:35:10.416
in order for everybody to get a full rest.

2567
01:35:10.416 --> 01:35:12.832
LAURA: Oh man.
SAM: Yeah, that's fine.

2568
01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:13.698
MARISHA: Could be a long day.

2569
01:35:13.698 --> 01:35:16.347
TRAVIS: No, no, no two and a half hours, three shifts.

2570
01:35:16.347 --> 01:35:17.305
We don't get a full rest.

2571
01:35:17.305 --> 01:35:18.539
SAM: We need a full rest,

2572
01:35:18.539 --> 01:35:19.372
that's the whole point.

2573
01:35:19.372 --> 01:35:20.612
TRAVIS: You got to hit the full ten hours,

2574
01:35:20.612 --> 01:35:21.445
everybody needs ten?

2575
01:35:21.445 --> 01:35:23.750
MATT: No, eight hours, but you need to do ten hours

2576
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:26.567
for everybody to do a shift and get eight hours of sleep.

2577
01:35:26.567 --> 01:35:28.350
TALIESIN: We'll keep sleeping till something happens,

2578
01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:29.352
anyway.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2579
01:35:29.352 --> 01:35:31.783
LIAM: Also, I would have taken time

2580
01:35:31.783 --> 01:35:34.295
to put the wire in front of the door

2581
01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:39.295
and I've told Frumpkin to wake me up

2582
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:41.223
should anyone come into the back.

2583
01:35:41.223 --> 01:35:42.391
LAURA: Normally, we just do three shifts, right?

2584
01:35:42.391 --> 01:35:44.967
We do three watches for eight hour shifts.

2585
01:35:44.967 --> 01:35:46.550
SAM: I don't need to rest.

2586
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:47.734
I can just be exhausted.

2587
01:35:47.734 --> 01:35:48.999
MATT: For everyone to get eight hours of sleep

2588
01:35:48.999 --> 01:35:51.879
is three shifts that I consider to be distributed

2589
01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:52.791
over a ten hour period.

2590
01:35:52.791 --> 01:35:53.780
LAURA: Okay.

2591
01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:55.580
ASHLEY: Yeah, we can sleep until something happens,

2592
01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:56.420
you know?

2593
01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:58.229
SAM: I could just be exhausted

2594
01:35:58.229 --> 01:36:00.247
and then everyone else can take out--

2595
01:36:00.247 --> 01:36:01.495
MARISHA: Well, we'll see if we need it.

2596
01:36:01.495 --> 01:36:03.121
TALIESIN: Because then it'd just be two hours of nothing

2597
01:36:03.121 --> 01:36:04.423
happening and then you've got exhaustion--

2598
01:36:04.423 --> 01:36:06.005
MARISHA: We need that last two hours, then--

2599
01:36:06.005 --> 01:36:06.838
SAM: Yeah.

2600
01:36:08.838 --> 01:36:09.966
MARISHA: All right.

2601
01:36:09.966 --> 01:36:12.263
TRAVIS: We got to get somebody in that building, just saying

2602
01:36:12.263 --> 01:36:13.175
That's all right.

2603
01:36:13.175 --> 01:36:14.231
MARISHA: Yeah, what if he teleports,

2604
01:36:14.231 --> 01:36:16.199
like what if there's a teleportation circle upstairs

2605
01:36:16.199 --> 01:36:17.463
and we don't see shit?

2606
01:36:17.463 --> 01:36:18.951
MATT: By the time this rest has begun,

2607
01:36:18.951 --> 01:36:21.754
it's about three in the morning, just so you're aware.

2608
01:36:21.754 --> 01:36:23.787
Both of you, I would like to make perception checks, please

2609
01:36:23.787 --> 01:36:24.723
for your watch.

2610
01:36:24.723 --> 01:36:27.089
LAURA: So stupid, we're going to miss him completely.

2611
01:36:27.089 --> 01:36:31.027
LIAM: I'm going to cast dunamancy on myself

2612
01:36:31.027 --> 01:36:33.157
before just in case.

2613
01:36:33.157 --> 01:36:34.791
I'm going to use it now.

2614
01:36:34.791 --> 01:36:35.999
MATT: Okay.

2615
01:36:35.999 --> 01:36:37.143
LIAM: Barely different.

2616
01:36:37.143 --> 01:36:38.901
Perception, you said?
MATT: Yes.

2617
01:36:38.901 --> 01:36:39.817
LIAM and MATT: 13.

2618
01:36:39.817 --> 01:36:40.650
MARISHA and MATT: Eight.

2619
01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:41.908
MATT: Okay, you guys keep watch.

2620
01:36:41.908 --> 01:36:44.100
A few figures wander through the street,

2621
01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:46.234
but through the watch that you guys take,

2622
01:36:46.234 --> 01:36:47.895
no one seems to pay any mind

2623
01:36:47.895 --> 01:36:51.288
or go bother the Overcrow Apothecary.

2624
01:36:51.288 --> 01:36:52.663
You complete your watch.

2625
01:36:52.663 --> 01:36:53.496
Who's taking up next?

2626
01:36:53.496 --> 01:36:54.917
LIAM: Just with briefest thing,

2627
01:36:54.917 --> 01:36:56.375
an hour and a half into silence,

2628
01:36:56.375 --> 01:36:58.351
looking out windows,

2629
01:36:58.351 --> 01:37:01.445
breaking the silence: Beauregard?

2630
01:37:01.445 --> 01:37:02.278
MARISHA: What?

2631
01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:05.201
LIAM: I'm glad you're here.

2632
01:37:06.935 --> 01:37:09.685
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm glad you're here, too.

2633
01:37:10.551 --> 01:37:14.808
MATT: Okay. Next watch is Yasha and--

2634
01:37:14.808 --> 01:37:15.650
TRAVIS: I'll do it.

2635
01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:17.058
MATT: Fjord. All right, both of you guys,

2636
01:37:17.058 --> 01:37:19.824
perception checks for me, please.

2637
01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:23.665
LIAM: Goddamn.
TALIESIN: Jesus.

2638
01:37:24.568 --> 01:37:25.479
TRAVIS: Eight.

2639
01:37:25.479 --> 01:37:27.344
MARISHA: Shit, fuck.

2640
01:37:27.344 --> 01:37:29.139
LIAM: You're going to break your Wyrmwood!

2641
01:37:29.139 --> 01:37:29.972
ASHLEY: 18.

2642
01:37:29.972 --> 01:37:31.079
MATT: 18, okay.

2643
01:37:31.079 --> 01:37:32.684
SAM: Nice, Yasher.

2644
01:37:32.684 --> 01:37:35.352
MATT: Between the hours at five and seven in the morning,

2645
01:37:35.352 --> 01:37:36.199
the sunrise would have happened

2646
01:37:36.199 --> 01:37:39.447
if there was a sunrise in Rosohna.

2647
01:37:39.447 --> 01:37:40.775
TALIESIN: That's right.

2648
01:37:40.775 --> 01:37:42.405
MATT: Through your watch,

2649
01:37:42.405 --> 01:37:44.199
you you see elements of the street

2650
01:37:44.199 --> 01:37:45.032
begin to come more lively.

2651
01:37:45.032 --> 01:37:47.383
Some of the early risers begin to awaken.

2652
01:37:47.383 --> 01:37:50.151
You can hear some of the

2653
01:37:50.151 --> 01:37:55.035
chickens and other nearby kept livestock

2654
01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:56.375
beginning to awaken

2655
01:37:56.375 --> 01:38:00.677
and make their various noises beginning the day,

2656
01:38:00.677 --> 01:38:03.030
as well as hearing wagons go down the street.

2657
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:06.584
It's starting to become, you know, a lively neighborhood,

2658
01:38:06.584 --> 01:38:10.434
but you don't see anyone mess with it

2659
01:38:10.434 --> 01:38:11.881
until the very end.

2660
01:38:11.881 --> 01:38:13.973
You see a familiar goblin,

2661
01:38:13.973 --> 01:38:16.087
one who runs the establishment,

2662
01:38:16.087 --> 01:38:18.395
approach the outside front door,

2663
01:38:18.395 --> 01:38:19.610
pull out a ring of keys,

2664
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:23.428
unlock it, enter and close the door behind her.

2665
01:38:23.428 --> 01:38:26.225
LAURA: When are we going to sneak in? Fucking shit!

2666
01:38:26.225 --> 01:38:27.479
TRAVIS: That's fine.

2667
01:38:27.479 --> 01:38:28.391
LAURA: The bugbear could've been in there.

2668
01:38:28.391 --> 01:38:31.729
LIAM: ♪ But her ring of keys. ♪

2669
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:35.588
(laughter)

2670
01:38:35.588 --> 01:38:37.561
MATT: You guys finish your watch?

2671
01:38:37.561 --> 01:38:38.567
You finish your watch?

2672
01:38:38.567 --> 01:38:39.400
TRAVIS: We're finished.

2673
01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:40.725
MATT: All right, who's up next?
ASHLEY: Hey Fjord,

2674
01:38:40.725 --> 01:38:41.847
I'm glad you're here.

2675
01:38:41.847 --> 01:38:44.097
(laughter)

2676
01:38:45.175 --> 01:38:46.912
And I go to bed.

2677
01:38:46.912 --> 01:38:49.638
(laughter)

2678
01:38:49.638 --> 01:38:52.071
TRAVIS: I've never seen anyone fall asleep that fast.

2679
01:38:52.071 --> 01:38:54.726
MATT: She goes to REM state like that. Barbarians, man.

2680
01:38:54.726 --> 01:38:58.261
TRAVIS: We relay that that very familiar goblin

2681
01:38:58.261 --> 01:39:00.455
walked in with that ring of keys.

2682
01:39:00.455 --> 01:39:02.142
SAM: I'm taking the last watch.

2683
01:39:02.142 --> 01:39:04.351
MATT: There's two more watches.

2684
01:39:04.351 --> 01:39:05.879
SAM: I'll take the next watch.

2685
01:39:05.879 --> 01:39:07.187
MATT: Okay, perception check.

2686
01:39:07.187 --> 01:39:09.904
SAM: Solo, I guess. Is anyone--

2687
01:39:09.904 --> 01:39:11.093
TALIESIN: I'm saving--
LAURA: No, I guess I'll--

2688
01:39:11.093 --> 01:39:13.539
SAM: No, it's fine, whatever.

2689
01:39:13.539 --> 01:39:17.092
MARISHA: Let the spellcasters have uninterrupted sleep.

2690
01:39:17.092 --> 01:39:18.180
LAURA: Huh?

2691
01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:19.013
LIAM: Perception.

2692
01:39:19.013 --> 01:39:22.869
LAURA: I know, I just need sleep to get my spells back

2693
01:39:22.869 --> 01:39:25.501
and then I can take over.

2694
01:39:25.501 --> 01:39:28.376
LIAM: If you stay up, I'll go to bed.

2695
01:39:28.376 --> 01:39:32.757
SAM: Okay, it's just me then, let's hope this roll's good.

2696
01:39:32.757 --> 01:39:35.298
Terrible, seven.
MATT: Seven, okay.

2697
01:39:35.298 --> 01:39:36.930
It's a seven you rolled or seven total?

2698
01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:38.079
SAM: Both.

2699
01:39:38.079 --> 01:39:38.912
I have zero.

2700
01:39:38.912 --> 01:39:40.162
MATT: Oh, all right.

2701
01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:46.370
SAM: During my watch, can I also Disguise Self

2702
01:39:46.673 --> 01:39:49.858
and just take a stroll back and forth on the block?

2703
01:39:49.858 --> 01:39:51.800
MATT: Sure, yeah.
SAM: Okay.

2704
01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.891
MATT: You see some

2705
01:39:53.891 --> 01:39:56.517
families getting up and gathering supplies

2706
01:39:56.517 --> 01:39:59.461
to go to small shopping trips further into the city,

2707
01:39:59.461 --> 01:40:00.661
you see soldiers coming through

2708
01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.229
and patrolling the vicinity.

2709
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:03.717
You get a little nervous and keep by,

2710
01:40:03.717 --> 01:40:05.189
but none of them seems to be interested

2711
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:06.293
in anything in the area.

2712
01:40:06.293 --> 01:40:07.126
They're just looking out

2713
01:40:07.126 --> 01:40:09.626
for any sort of funny business.

2714
01:40:11.878 --> 01:40:14.613
Nothing else seems to really catch your attention.

2715
01:40:14.613 --> 01:40:16.780
MARISHA: Oh fuck! What was that?

2716
01:40:20.293 --> 01:40:21.221
SAM: That's it.

2717
01:40:21.221 --> 01:40:23.998
LAURA: Have I slept for eight hours yet?

2718
01:40:23.998 --> 01:40:26.101
MATT: I'd say you've now slept for eight hours,

2719
01:40:26.101 --> 01:40:26.934
people that went first.

2720
01:40:26.934 --> 01:40:28.117
LAURA: Can I wake up then?

2721
01:40:28.117 --> 01:40:28.950
MATT: You can wake up,

2722
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:30.229
but the people that took first watch,

2723
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:32.245
which is Beau and Caleb,

2724
01:40:32.245 --> 01:40:33.653
you still need to take one more watch

2725
01:40:33.653 --> 01:40:34.677
for them to get their full rest.

2726
01:40:34.677 --> 01:40:35.525
TALIESIN: All right, we're up.

2727
01:40:35.525 --> 01:40:38.729
MARISHA: That's good, spellcasters are good.

2728
01:40:38.729 --> 01:40:41.717
LAURA: As soon as I wake up,

2729
01:40:41.717 --> 01:40:43.669
I'm going to cast Locate Object.

2730
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:44.629
MATT: Okay.

2731
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:46.101
LAURA: On that on that little book

2732
01:40:46.101 --> 01:40:47.522
that I saw him writing in.

2733
01:40:47.522 --> 01:40:49.189
MATT: Okay. You cast Locate Object

2734
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:50.869
and focus on the tome

2735
01:40:50.869 --> 01:40:52.197
that you saw on the first,

2736
01:40:52.197 --> 01:40:54.197
or the journal in the second?

2737
01:40:54.197 --> 01:40:55.863
LAURA: The journal in the second.
MATT: Okay, got you.

2738
01:40:55.863 --> 01:40:57.806
You cast it, you focus, you concentrate,

2739
01:40:57.806 --> 01:41:00.661
you extend your will and consciousness

2740
01:41:00.661 --> 01:41:02.053
towards this divine cloud

2741
01:41:02.053 --> 01:41:04.997
asking the Traveler to guide your intent

2742
01:41:04.997 --> 01:41:08.682
and it finds purchase on nothing.

2743
01:41:08.682 --> 01:41:10.107
TALIESIN: It's not within 1000 feet.

2744
01:41:10.107 --> 01:41:11.501
LAURA: Well.

2745
01:41:11.501 --> 01:41:12.675
TALIESIN: That's a good sign.

2746
01:41:12.675 --> 01:41:13.508
LAURA: Maybe.

2747
01:41:13.508 --> 01:41:15.541
MATT: You both could get to make perception checks.

2748
01:41:15.541 --> 01:41:17.442
TALIESIN: I will make a perception check.

2749
01:41:17.442 --> 01:41:19.572
SAM: Make it strong.

2750
01:41:19.572 --> 01:41:21.669
TALIESIN: My perception is,

2751
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:23.253
I rolled terribly.

2752
01:41:23.253 --> 01:41:24.447
LAURA: I rolled a 15.

2753
01:41:24.447 --> 01:41:25.476
TALIESIN: 11.

2754
01:41:25.476 --> 01:41:29.429
MATT: 11, okay, 15.

2755
01:41:29.429 --> 01:41:30.708
At the end of your watch,

2756
01:41:30.708 --> 01:41:34.255
towards the final 20 minutes or so,

2757
01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:39.572
you see two figures walking down the street

2758
01:41:39.572 --> 01:41:42.933
that approach the exterior of the Apothecary.

2759
01:41:42.933 --> 01:41:46.244
One of them is a tall male hobgoblin in a breastplate.

2760
01:41:46.244 --> 01:41:48.276
It's obscured by a leather cowl

2761
01:41:48.276 --> 01:41:51.253
with a large sword sheathed on his back.

2762
01:41:51.253 --> 01:41:54.210
The other appears to be elven in stature,

2763
01:41:54.210 --> 01:41:55.685
long tattered black cloak

2764
01:41:55.685 --> 01:41:57.935
that's pulled around a set of gray leather armor.

2765
01:41:57.935 --> 01:41:59.605
Their head is obscured by a hood

2766
01:41:59.605 --> 01:42:01.267
in a face wrap of blue cloth

2767
01:42:01.267 --> 01:42:03.973
and both of them approach the front

2768
01:42:03.973 --> 01:42:05.295
and push in the door.

2769
01:42:05.295 --> 01:42:06.425
The door opens.

2770
01:42:06.425 --> 01:42:07.258
LAURA: Do I see any blonde?

2771
01:42:07.258 --> 01:42:08.091
Do I seen any?

2772
01:42:08.091 --> 01:42:09.247
MATT: Make a perception check.

2773
01:42:09.247 --> 01:42:10.273
Oh, no, you already made your roll.

2774
01:42:10.273 --> 01:42:14.273
You don't see any particular details

2775
01:42:14.273 --> 01:42:15.216
of blonde hair necessarily,

2776
01:42:15.216 --> 01:42:18.919
but you see a bit of the skin: appears to be drow.

2777
01:42:18.919 --> 01:42:20.627
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.

2778
01:42:20.627 --> 01:42:21.985
MATT: Okay. 30-foot range.

2779
01:42:21.985 --> 01:42:22.913
You detect no magic.

2780
01:42:22.913 --> 01:42:25.313
TALIESIN: Oh shit, I am too far away, aren't I?

2781
01:42:25.313 --> 01:42:26.416
Would I have known that?

2782
01:42:26.416 --> 01:42:27.249
MATT: You would've known that.

2783
01:42:27.249 --> 01:42:28.097
TALIESIN: Okay.

2784
01:42:28.097 --> 01:42:31.259
LAURA: I hit everybody. (shushes)

2785
01:42:31.259 --> 01:42:33.630
Somebody just went in, somebody just went in.

2786
01:42:33.630 --> 01:42:35.601
TRAVIS: Somebody?
LAURA: Two people.

2787
01:42:35.601 --> 01:42:37.074
TRAVIS: What'd they look like?

2788
01:42:37.074 --> 01:42:39.601
LAURA: One was a hobgoblin, one was a drow.

2789
01:42:39.601 --> 01:42:40.849
They were in cloaks.

2790
01:42:40.849 --> 01:42:41.840
They had their cloaks pulled up,

2791
01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.273
but they could be anything,

2792
01:42:45.273 --> 01:42:47.179
they could be anything.

2793
01:42:48.954 --> 01:42:50.305
SAM: Did we get our rest or no?

2794
01:42:50.305 --> 01:42:52.305
MATT: No, they have another like 20 minutes or so

2795
01:42:52.305 --> 01:42:54.368
before they finish their rest. You have yours.

2796
01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:55.201
SAM: Okay.

2797
01:42:55.201 --> 01:42:57.778
TRAVIS: What's an animal that's not stupid? A mouse.

2798
01:42:57.778 --> 01:43:00.366
MATT: Everyone but Beau and Caleb can be awake now

2799
01:43:00.366 --> 01:43:01.957
with a full rest.

2800
01:43:01.957 --> 01:43:04.200
SAM: Let's go in there.

2801
01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:05.809
I can just be a customer.

2802
01:43:05.809 --> 01:43:08.142
I'll Disguise Self and I'll just go in and be a customer

2803
01:43:08.142 --> 01:43:10.961
looking for dick oil or something.

2804
01:43:10.961 --> 01:43:12.994
LAURA: Okay, go look for dick oil.

2805
01:43:12.994 --> 01:43:14.049
TRAVIS: You don't want to have a rat follow you in

2806
01:43:14.049 --> 01:43:16.001
after you get told to leave?

2807
01:43:16.001 --> 01:43:17.681
LAURA: I don't know if a rat is smart.

2808
01:43:17.681 --> 01:43:20.545
Where do you find the rat stats?

2809
01:43:20.545 --> 01:43:21.617
MATT: I have the rat stats here.

2810
01:43:21.617 --> 01:43:23.137
TALIESIN and LIAM: Rat stats!

2811
01:43:23.137 --> 01:43:24.387
MATT: Ratus status.

2812
01:43:25.345 --> 01:43:27.264
LIAM: It's in D&amp;D Beyond under "Creatures."

2813
01:43:27.264 --> 01:43:28.170
LAURA: I'm looking under--

2814
01:43:28.170 --> 01:43:30.669
MATT: Brra! Brra! Brra! Hercules Mulligan!

2815
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:32.622
SAM: Crows are not very intelligent.

2816
01:43:32.622 --> 01:43:34.289
MATT: A rat has an intellect of two.

2817
01:43:34.289 --> 01:43:35.122
So it's twice as good.

2818
01:43:35.122 --> 01:43:36.655
TRAVIS: What about a sparrow or a bird?

2819
01:43:36.655 --> 01:43:39.185
SAM: That's fine because you're just going to be,

2820
01:43:39.185 --> 01:43:42.545
why don't you just be on my shoulder the whole time?

2821
01:43:42.545 --> 01:43:44.753
I'm a weirdo who has a pet bird.

2822
01:43:44.753 --> 01:43:46.897
MATT: It's the intelligence level between a moth to a rat.

2823
01:43:46.897 --> 01:43:50.634
It's a pretty big jump, comparatively.

2824
01:43:50.634 --> 01:43:52.115
LAURA: Okay, I'll be a rat.
MATT: I say this as a person

2825
01:43:52.115 --> 01:43:54.759
that has been fighting moths in our house for months

2826
01:43:54.759 --> 01:43:56.520
and I fucking hate them.

2827
01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.028
MARISHA: Pieces of shit.
MATT: I know.

2828
01:43:58.028 --> 01:44:00.944
TRAVIS: You have to lower yourself to their level, Matthew.

2829
01:44:00.944 --> 01:44:03.648
SAM: Are you going to scurry in or be in my pocket or what?

2830
01:44:03.648 --> 01:44:05.881
LAURA: I'll be on be on your shoulder.

2831
01:44:05.881 --> 01:44:07.712
SAM: As a rat?
LAURA: Goblins eat rats,

2832
01:44:07.712 --> 01:44:08.545
don't they?

2833
01:44:08.545 --> 01:44:09.724
SAM: No, I don't have to be a goblin.

2834
01:44:09.724 --> 01:44:10.557
I could be anything.

2835
01:44:10.557 --> 01:44:13.343
I'll be a little, I'll be a halfling.

2836
01:44:13.343 --> 01:44:14.799
LAURA: No, don't be having a halfling, that's obvious.

2837
01:44:14.799 --> 01:44:18.446
SAM: Oh, I'll be a short drow.

2838
01:44:18.446 --> 01:44:19.503
LAURA: No, be a goblin.

2839
01:44:19.503 --> 01:44:22.836
SAM: Okay, I'll just be a different goblin.

2840
01:44:23.939 --> 01:44:25.631
TALIESIN: This is going to--

2841
01:44:25.631 --> 01:44:27.854
MATT: And what are you doing, Jester?

2842
01:44:27.854 --> 01:44:31.134
LAURA: I'm going to Polymorph myself into a rat, I guess

2843
01:44:31.134 --> 01:44:35.790
and I'm just going to sit inside her hood, right there.

2844
01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:36.623
MATT: There you go.

2845
01:44:36.623 --> 01:44:37.771
And you were looking like a different goblin?

2846
01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:38.766
SAM: A different goblin.

2847
01:44:38.766 --> 01:44:41.134
I'll look like the goblin that was guarding

2848
01:44:41.134 --> 01:44:45.388
that weird wizard tower way back in Nicodranas.

2849
01:44:45.388 --> 01:44:47.597
MATT: Okay, so balding, slicked back,

2850
01:44:47.597 --> 01:44:49.596
really well-dressed.

2851
01:44:49.596 --> 01:44:50.429
Same attire?

2852
01:44:50.429 --> 01:44:52.126
SAM: Sure.
MATT: All right, you are

2853
01:44:52.126 --> 01:44:54.848
a debonair goblin.
LAURA: That seems obvious.

2854
01:44:54.848 --> 01:44:56.238
MATT: What were you saying?

2855
01:44:56.238 --> 01:44:57.071
TRAVIS: I was going to say:

2856
01:44:57.071 --> 01:44:58.929
who's awake and not still sleeping?

2857
01:44:58.929 --> 01:45:00.633
LAURA: Everybody but them.

2858
01:45:00.633 --> 01:45:02.210
TRAVIS: Who wants to go around back?

2859
01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:03.614
ASHLEY: I can go around back.

2860
01:45:03.614 --> 01:45:04.844
LIAM: Frumpkin is there.

2861
01:45:04.844 --> 01:45:08.477
TALIESIN: I'll keep an eye out over here.

2862
01:45:08.477 --> 01:45:11.534
TRAVIS: I will disguise myself as a very

2863
01:45:11.534 --> 01:45:12.716
wealthy looking drow this time,

2864
01:45:12.716 --> 01:45:14.190
slightly nicer robes

2865
01:45:14.190 --> 01:45:17.710
walking with what could possibly be security or--

2866
01:45:17.710 --> 01:45:19.612
LAURA: I don't know enough about this spell.

2867
01:45:19.612 --> 01:45:22.254
Polymorph, I don't know if I want to Polymorph, y'all.

2868
01:45:22.254 --> 01:45:23.501
TALIESIN: It's a lot, isn't it?

2869
01:45:23.501 --> 01:45:24.557
ASHLEY: Walking with him,

2870
01:45:24.557 --> 01:45:26.974
but I'll try to look like I'm your security.

2871
01:45:26.974 --> 01:45:28.933
TRAVIS: Dope.

2872
01:45:28.933 --> 01:45:31.464
MATT: Jester, are you okay? You look perturbed.

2873
01:45:31.464 --> 01:45:34.014
LAURA: I just don't know if I should be a rat.

2874
01:45:34.014 --> 01:45:37.229
You guys, I don't think I should Polymorph myself.

2875
01:45:37.229 --> 01:45:38.070
TRAVIS: Why?

2876
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:40.766
LAURA: Just because I don't know enough about it to know,

2877
01:45:40.766 --> 01:45:42.507
can you--
SAM: Can you disguise yourself?

2878
01:45:42.507 --> 01:45:43.824
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Why don't you do that

2879
01:45:43.824 --> 01:45:45.505
and I'll go in invisible?

2880
01:45:45.505 --> 01:45:47.262
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to disguise myself instead.

2881
01:45:47.262 --> 01:45:48.337
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Invisible

2882
01:45:48.337 --> 01:45:50.362
in a room full of magic users.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

2883
01:45:50.362 --> 01:45:53.342
SAM: All right, then I will drop Disguise Self

2884
01:45:53.342 --> 01:45:54.910
and I'll just be invisible.

2885
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:56.142
TALIESIN: I mean they're also, to be fair,

2886
01:45:56.142 --> 01:45:58.168
there's a bunch of magic people in there.

2887
01:45:58.168 --> 01:46:00.190
They're going to see through anything we do anyway.

2888
01:46:00.190 --> 01:46:02.023
TRAVIS: Possibly.
TALIESIN: Probably.

2889
01:46:03.246 --> 01:46:05.758
TRAVIS: Just make a fucking racket if you get found out.

2890
01:46:05.758 --> 01:46:07.540
MATT: What are you-- are you both going invisible

2891
01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.147
or you're disguising yourself?
LAURA: I'm disguising myself

2892
01:46:09.147 --> 01:46:10.807
MATT: What are you disguising yourself as?

2893
01:46:10.807 --> 01:46:12.557
LAURA: Somebody my height.

2894
01:46:14.707 --> 01:46:19.506
I'm going to be a drow.

2895
01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:20.922
MATT: All righty.

2896
01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:23.515
LAURA: Damn these horns,

2897
01:46:23.515 --> 01:46:26.350
just (humming)

2898
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:28.638
because I can't put my hood up, it's obvious.

2899
01:46:28.638 --> 01:46:31.993
I'm going to go in and I'm going to be, like,

2900
01:46:31.993 --> 01:46:34.206
nice, but not too nice.

2901
01:46:34.206 --> 01:46:36.061
I'm going to be in dark colors,

2902
01:46:36.061 --> 01:46:39.484
but no fine details or anything like that,

2903
01:46:39.484 --> 01:46:42.409
no bright colors, yeah.

2904
01:46:42.409 --> 01:46:44.367
MATT: Okay, and you're going invisible?
SAM: Yep.

2905
01:46:44.367 --> 01:46:46.263
LAURA: Dark hair.

2906
01:46:46.263 --> 01:46:48.302
MATT: So you two are traveling towards the front.

2907
01:46:48.302 --> 01:46:49.135
What are you guys doing?

2908
01:46:49.135 --> 01:46:52.142
TRAVIS: Yasha and I are going to walk down the back,

2909
01:46:52.142 --> 01:46:53.294
viewing properties.

2910
01:46:53.294 --> 01:46:55.276
MATT: Just make general stealth checks, both of you,

2911
01:46:55.276 --> 01:46:58.626
just to try and be--
TRAVIS: Be cool?

2912
01:46:58.626 --> 01:47:01.118
MATT: Yeah, to not draw any unwanted attention

2913
01:47:01.118 --> 01:47:03.486
and keep it casual.

2914
01:47:03.486 --> 01:47:05.294
It's not a terribly high DC.

2915
01:47:05.294 --> 01:47:06.510
TRAVIS: Oh, plus zero, 15.

2916
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:08.725
ASHLEY: Seven.
MATT: Seven, okay.

2917
01:47:08.725 --> 01:47:09.558
All right.

2918
01:47:11.287 --> 01:47:14.171
All right, you guys meander around

2919
01:47:14.171 --> 01:47:16.726
at a fairly safe distance,

2920
01:47:16.726 --> 01:47:18.382
walk between two buildings,

2921
01:47:18.382 --> 01:47:19.470
make your way to the back alley

2922
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:22.222
that rests behind most of the buildings here

2923
01:47:22.222 --> 01:47:23.838
that are set up on the front of the street level.

2924
01:47:23.838 --> 01:47:25.582
TRAVIS: We'll be pointing at the structures

2925
01:47:25.582 --> 01:47:27.070
on the opposite side of this alley,

2926
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:28.235
pointing and gesturing

2927
01:47:28.235 --> 01:47:30.206
and talking about the worth

2928
01:47:30.206 --> 01:47:32.373
of what such a building might cost,

2929
01:47:32.373 --> 01:47:35.022
maybe checking the ground, the soil,

2930
01:47:35.022 --> 01:47:36.718
just sort of looking like we might be interested

2931
01:47:36.718 --> 01:47:37.676
in purchasing.

2932
01:47:37.676 --> 01:47:38.859
ASHLEY: Purchasing real estate.

2933
01:47:38.859 --> 01:47:40.567
MATT: Gotcha, okay.

2934
01:47:42.318 --> 01:47:46.924
So Jester, Nott,

2935
01:47:46.924 --> 01:47:51.550
you guys are invisible, disguised,

2936
01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:52.910
making your way towards the front of the complex.

2937
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:55.281
SAM: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Yeah.

2938
01:47:55.281 --> 01:47:57.659
MATT: Okay, you approach the front of the Overcrow.

2939
01:47:57.659 --> 01:48:00.383
The front door is closed,

2940
01:48:00.383 --> 01:48:03.950
but you reach up and take the front handle

2941
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:05.358
and it is not locked.

2942
01:48:05.358 --> 01:48:07.442
(creaking)

2943
01:48:07.442 --> 01:48:08.683
It opens on the inside.

2944
01:48:08.683 --> 01:48:11.342
Familiar smell and sight greets you

2945
01:48:11.342 --> 01:48:12.263
as you glance inside.

2946
01:48:12.263 --> 01:48:15.119
You can see across the way, Maruo is at the front

2947
01:48:15.119 --> 01:48:17.310
sitting in the chair and looking over

2948
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:18.766
and puts a hand up.

2949
01:48:18.766 --> 01:48:19.599
"Hey."

2950
01:48:21.996 --> 01:48:23.598
Looking in the inside of the chamber,

2951
01:48:23.598 --> 01:48:26.715
you can see only one figure.

2952
01:48:26.715 --> 01:48:30.011
You see the hobgoblin that had approached

2953
01:48:30.011 --> 01:48:31.166
with the other figure.

2954
01:48:31.166 --> 01:48:32.909
It's just sitting, arms crossed,

2955
01:48:32.909 --> 01:48:35.502
leaning against the outside of the spiral staircase

2956
01:48:35.502 --> 01:48:36.669
that leads up.

2957
01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:39.902
SAM: To the upstairs?

2958
01:48:39.902 --> 01:48:40.735
MATT: Yes.

2959
01:48:40.735 --> 01:48:44.132
SAM: The other fellow who was an elf is not there?

2960
01:48:44.132 --> 01:48:45.832
Cool, cool, cool.

2961
01:48:47.117 --> 01:48:48.617
LAURA: Okay, I walk in.

2962
01:48:50.514 --> 01:48:51.664
(British accent) Are you the goblin

2963
01:48:51.664 --> 01:48:53.397
that runs this establishment?

2964
01:48:53.397 --> 01:48:54.989
MATT: "That's me."

2965
01:48:54.989 --> 01:48:57.050
LAURA: I have a bone to pick with you.

2966
01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:58.044
MATT: "What's the problem?

2967
01:48:58.044 --> 01:48:59.773
"Is there a problem?"

2968
01:48:59.773 --> 01:49:03.940
LAURA: You sold some sort of solution to my handmaiden.

2969
01:49:06.007 --> 01:49:06.840
MATT: "Did I?"

2970
01:49:09.323 --> 01:49:11.418
LAURA: She said it was for her hair.

2971
01:49:11.418 --> 01:49:13.179
It's falling out now.

2972
01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.937
MATT: "Can you come back tomorrow?

2973
01:49:14.937 --> 01:49:16.520
"I'm kind of closed."

2974
01:49:18.157 --> 01:49:19.115
LAURA: The door was open.

2975
01:49:19.115 --> 01:49:21.098
MATT: "That's my fault."

2976
01:49:22.903 --> 01:49:26.817
SAM: I'm going to be in the room as well if possible.

2977
01:49:26.817 --> 01:49:30.663
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check with advantage.

2978
01:49:30.663 --> 01:49:32.788
SAM: Okay, 23.

2979
01:49:32.788 --> 01:49:34.387
MATT: Okay.

2980
01:49:34.387 --> 01:49:38.039
LAURA: I do believe we should sort this out now.

2981
01:49:38.039 --> 01:49:40.344
MATT: "What do you need?"

2982
01:49:40.344 --> 01:49:43.288
LAURA: I would like her finances returned.

2983
01:49:43.288 --> 01:49:44.760
MATT: "Well, you see it's--"

2984
01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.357
LAURA: And a solution to this problem.

2985
01:49:46.357 --> 01:49:48.440
MATT: Make a deception check.

2986
01:49:49.417 --> 01:49:50.728
You do have advantage on this

2987
01:49:50.728 --> 01:49:53.561
because you're in a different form.

2988
01:49:54.690 --> 01:49:56.994
LAURA, SAM, and TALIESIN: Ooh!

2989
01:49:56.994 --> 01:49:58.988
TALIESIN: Where is it?

2990
01:49:58.988 --> 01:50:01.703
LAURA: Ooh, 22.

2991
01:50:01.703 --> 01:50:06.703
MATT: "(laughs) Was that the one with the blue skin?

2992
01:50:08.903 --> 01:50:12.370
"All right, how much how much did she pay?

2993
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:14.787
"Oh, I'll go check my ledger here."

2994
01:50:19.556 --> 01:50:21.859
Counts up with some coins.

2995
01:50:21.859 --> 01:50:25.357
"Here, a refund on it, my apologies."

2996
01:50:25.357 --> 01:50:27.940
LAURA: I look over at the hobgoblin.

2997
01:50:28.904 --> 01:50:31.091
MATT: Just looking out of the corner of their eye at you.

2998
01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:34.732
LAURA: I hope you aren't planning on buying anything here.

2999
01:50:34.732 --> 01:50:36.278
MATT: "Just perusing."

3000
01:50:36.278 --> 01:50:38.545
LAURA: Be warned.

3001
01:50:41.472 --> 01:50:43.722
Oh no.
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out.

3002
01:50:45.173 --> 01:50:47.581
LAURA: Hmm! And I walk back out.

3003
01:50:49.139 --> 01:50:51.763
MATT: "Close the door behind you, if you don't mind."

3004
01:50:51.763 --> 01:50:53.611
LAURA: (grunts) I'm closing it.

3005
01:50:53.611 --> 01:50:54.736
MATT: Okay. (shutting)

3006
01:50:54.736 --> 01:50:58.423
LAURA: Hey, I got my five gold back, sweet.

3007
01:50:58.423 --> 01:50:59.283
MATT: You're still inside.

3008
01:50:59.283 --> 01:51:00.131
SAM: I'm still inside.

3009
01:51:00.131 --> 01:51:01.089
MATT: Yes, you are.

3010
01:51:01.089 --> 01:51:03.214
TRAVIS: Did your hair stink while you're in there

3011
01:51:03.214 --> 01:51:04.047
the whole time?

3012
01:51:04.047 --> 01:51:05.075
LAURA: Maybe.

3013
01:51:05.075 --> 01:51:08.961
MATT: While you're in there for awhile, silent.

3014
01:51:08.961 --> 01:51:10.127
They're not even talking

3015
01:51:10.127 --> 01:51:11.747
and then at one point, Maruo's like,

3016
01:51:11.747 --> 01:51:13.705
"So...

3017
01:51:15.731 --> 01:51:17.172
"nice day, right?"

3018
01:51:18.395 --> 01:51:19.395
No response.

3019
01:51:21.282 --> 01:51:23.623
SAM: If he's, okay.

3020
01:51:27.005 --> 01:51:29.475
MATT: "Hope you didn't journey too far."

3021
01:51:29.475 --> 01:51:31.697
SAM: I'm going to knock something off of a counter.

3022
01:51:31.697 --> 01:51:34.083
MATT: Okay, what are you knocking over?

3023
01:51:34.083 --> 01:51:35.562
TRAVIS: Why?

3024
01:51:35.562 --> 01:51:37.315
SAM: Just a book or something.

3025
01:51:37.315 --> 01:51:38.867
I don't know what she has around.

3026
01:51:38.867 --> 01:51:40.284
MATT: They both look.

3027
01:51:43.615 --> 01:51:47.731
Immediately, the mood in the room changes

3028
01:51:47.731 --> 01:51:50.659
and the hobgoblin grabs the sword

3029
01:51:50.659 --> 01:51:53.233
and just gets to the ready and walks over.

3030
01:51:53.233 --> 01:51:54.833
SAM: Okay. While he's walking over there,

3031
01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:59.169
I'm going to try to very stealthily go up the stairs.

3032
01:51:59.169 --> 01:52:00.435
MATT: Okay.

3033
01:52:00.435 --> 01:52:02.207
Make another stealth check with advantage.

3034
01:52:02.207 --> 01:52:03.040
LIAM: Come on!

3035
01:52:04.432 --> 01:52:06.871
Vax be with you.

3036
01:52:06.871 --> 01:52:07.704
SAM: 25.

3037
01:52:08.896 --> 01:52:10.122
MATT: Okay.

3038
01:52:10.122 --> 01:52:14.387
Carefully making your way up the spiral staircase,

3039
01:52:14.387 --> 01:52:16.963
you get to the very top and there is the door

3040
01:52:16.963 --> 01:52:18.961
that leads into the next chamber.

3041
01:52:18.961 --> 01:52:21.501
SAM: Okay, I'm just going to hang there for a second,

3042
01:52:21.501 --> 01:52:23.442
listen for voices downstairs

3043
01:52:23.442 --> 01:52:25.155
and listen for voices inside.

3044
01:52:26.996 --> 01:52:29.330
MATT: You hear Maruo say, "I don't know

3045
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:31.267
"maybe he just stumbled onto things."

3046
01:52:31.267 --> 01:52:33.600
"Things just don't stumble.

3047
01:52:36.774 --> 01:52:38.435
"Be quiet."

3048
01:52:38.435 --> 01:52:40.873
You just hear (heavy footsteps).

3049
01:52:40.873 --> 01:52:42.356
SAM: Up the stairs?

3050
01:52:42.356 --> 01:52:46.828
MATT: Like roaming the room and looking under tables

3051
01:52:46.828 --> 01:52:49.756
and you hear shuffling and things being moved

3052
01:52:49.756 --> 01:52:51.995
and scraped across the wood floor.

3053
01:52:51.995 --> 01:52:53.548
LAURA: Are there any windows on the upstairs

3054
01:52:53.548 --> 01:52:54.940
that we can see from outside?

3055
01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:57.100
MATT: There was a single window at the front

3056
01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:59.176
that is closed.

3057
01:52:59.176 --> 01:53:01.516
It is what you were chewing on the night before.

3058
01:53:01.516 --> 01:53:04.603
LAURA: Is there any way to get up to the second floor

3059
01:53:04.603 --> 01:53:05.936
on the outside?

3060
01:53:05.936 --> 01:53:08.028
If I look around, can I climb a wall?

3061
01:53:08.028 --> 01:53:11.317
MATT: Make a perception check.

3062
01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:12.561
LAURA: Well--

3063
01:53:12.561 --> 01:53:13.954
MATT: Super cocked!

3064
01:53:13.954 --> 01:53:14.787
LAURA: Oh, come on!

3065
01:53:18.319 --> 01:53:20.536
MATT: There's nowhere you see safely to get up there

3066
01:53:20.536 --> 01:53:24.395
without being just an overt person climbing

3067
01:53:24.395 --> 01:53:25.887
in broad night light.

3068
01:53:25.887 --> 01:53:27.789
TALIESIN: Just stay in the room with me.

3069
01:53:27.789 --> 01:53:30.089
LIAM: There is a cat looking down at you.

3070
01:53:30.089 --> 01:53:32.008
SAM: Are they still asleep or?

3071
01:53:32.008 --> 01:53:33.192
MATT: You guys are awake now at this point,

3072
01:53:33.192 --> 01:53:34.392
you come to consciousness.

3073
01:53:34.392 --> 01:53:36.500
You're catching this partway into motion.

3074
01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:37.333
MARISHA: What?

3075
01:53:37.333 --> 01:53:38.877
TRAVIS: Well, plus nobody's in the fucking,

3076
01:53:38.877 --> 01:53:40.028
well some are in the house with you--

3077
01:53:40.028 --> 01:53:42.131
TALIESIN: People took initiative, I don't know.

3078
01:53:42.131 --> 01:53:42.964
MARISHA: What?!

3079
01:53:44.576 --> 01:53:46.382
SAM: He's looking around downstairs.

3080
01:53:46.382 --> 01:53:48.156
MATT: Yeah, and then turns the corner

3081
01:53:48.156 --> 01:53:50.398
and then after looking around for a second,

3082
01:53:50.398 --> 01:53:53.428
Maruo's like, "Look, the place is a little rickety.

3083
01:53:53.428 --> 01:53:55.761
"It's not the best furniture."

3084
01:53:57.098 --> 01:53:58.765
ASHLEY: Goblin Miss Piggy.

3085
01:53:59.954 --> 01:54:04.105
MATT: Then the hobgoblin just goes to the staircase

3086
01:54:04.105 --> 01:54:07.356
and begins walking up the stairs.

3087
01:54:07.356 --> 01:54:08.948
SAM: Oh fuck.
MATT: It's just coming closer and closer.

3088
01:54:08.948 --> 01:54:10.456
SAM: Is there any, on the landing where I am,

3089
01:54:10.456 --> 01:54:12.160
how much space is there?

3090
01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:13.683
MATT: It is a tight hallway

3091
01:54:13.683 --> 01:54:14.758
that's just wide enough for the doorway

3092
01:54:14.758 --> 01:54:17.675
before it opens into the next room.

3093
01:54:18.853 --> 01:54:21.672
SAM: Wow, that does not leave very--

3094
01:54:21.672 --> 01:54:24.853
MATT: You're about up to the belt on this hobgoblin.

3095
01:54:24.853 --> 01:54:26.675
It's a little bit lower.

3096
01:54:26.675 --> 01:54:28.374
SAM: And there's no nooks?

3097
01:54:28.374 --> 01:54:31.900
MATT: No, it's literally stairs and the door.

3098
01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:33.783
You are right--
SAM: Okay.

3099
01:54:33.783 --> 01:54:34.646
TRAVIS: Handrail?

3100
01:54:34.646 --> 01:54:36.916
SAM: I'm going to try--
LIAM: Van Damme it.

3101
01:54:36.916 --> 01:54:40.990
SAM: I'm going to try to go up on the ceiling.

3102
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:43.076
LAURA: Oh my god.

3103
01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:45.072
TRAVIS: Oh no. Okay.

3104
01:54:45.072 --> 01:54:46.361
LIAM: You're about to Van Damme it!

3105
01:54:46.361 --> 01:54:47.194
LAURA: Come on, come on.

3106
01:54:47.194 --> 01:54:50.005
Brace yourself on the walls, climb up.

3107
01:54:50.005 --> 01:54:52.060
MATT: It's totally doable if you weren't a tiny goblin.

3108
01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:53.730
LAURA: Ninja Warrior, Ninja Warrior.

3109
01:54:53.730 --> 01:54:54.688
MATT: Okay.

3110
01:54:54.688 --> 01:54:57.889
LIAM: She's three feet tall without our arms out.

3111
01:54:57.889 --> 01:55:01.832
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check for me, please.

3112
01:55:01.832 --> 01:55:04.984
LAURA: You can do it, you can do it, you can do it.

3113
01:55:04.984 --> 01:55:06.817
SAM: Athletics, not acro?

3114
01:55:07.836 --> 01:55:09.255
LAURA: Not acrobatics, not acrobatics?
SAM: 17.

3115
01:55:09.255 --> 01:55:10.525
MATT: This isn't acrobatics,

3116
01:55:10.525 --> 01:55:11.779
unless you want to parkour

3117
01:55:11.779 --> 01:55:13.720
and then defy gravity.

3118
01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:16.095
This is trying to climb up something

3119
01:55:16.095 --> 01:55:18.364
with very little grip and hold yourself up there.

3120
01:55:18.364 --> 01:55:21.232
17, though, is pretty good.

3121
01:55:21.232 --> 01:55:22.125
It's not going to last long,

3122
01:55:22.125 --> 01:55:24.950
but you managed to scramble up and push against it

3123
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:26.668
and you can feel your arms shaking

3124
01:55:26.668 --> 01:55:29.160
from the sweat starting to pour down your forehead.

3125
01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:31.372
You're trying desperately not to breathe out,

3126
01:55:31.372 --> 01:55:32.222
you're just holding your breath

3127
01:55:32.222 --> 01:55:33.055
and it's burning your lungs.

3128
01:55:33.055 --> 01:55:37.138
The hobgoblin moves up and grabs the door

3129
01:55:38.010 --> 01:55:39.343
and it opens up.

3130
01:55:40.202 --> 01:55:41.811
The top of the head is about to touch you

3131
01:55:41.811 --> 01:55:44.904
and you squeeze in and arch your back

3132
01:55:44.904 --> 01:55:48.340
and just barely manages to miss your torso.

3133
01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:49.647
As he enters the room,

3134
01:55:49.647 --> 01:55:54.043
the voice inside goes, "What is the problem?"

3135
01:55:54.043 --> 01:55:55.878
"There was a noise downstairs,

3136
01:55:55.878 --> 01:55:57.878
"I'm just looking around."

3137
01:56:00.627 --> 01:56:04.210
Walks inside the room for a second,

3138
01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:10.483
walks back out, closes the door,

3139
01:56:11.737 --> 01:56:14.737
and then walks back down the stairs.

3140
01:56:16.934 --> 01:56:18.517
You very carefully.

3141
01:56:21.519 --> 01:56:23.519
TRAVIS: You're all cramped up.

3142
01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:27.627
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

3143
01:56:27.627 --> 01:56:28.523
MATT: Now you're at the top of the stairs.

3144
01:56:28.523 --> 01:56:30.955
The hobgoblin is now at the bottom of the stairs blocking,

3145
01:56:30.955 --> 01:56:33.463
is standing right in front of the steps.

3146
01:56:33.463 --> 01:56:35.166
SAM: If I were to cast Message

3147
01:56:35.166 --> 01:56:37.510
that would kill my Invisibility, right?

3148
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:40.496
Yeah, so I'm not going to do that.

3149
01:56:40.496 --> 01:56:41.768
I'll wait a few more minutes

3150
01:56:41.768 --> 01:56:42.978
and see if my friends do anything

3151
01:56:42.978 --> 01:56:46.920
and if not, I'll probably do some more stupid things.

3152
01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:47.753
LAURA: I'm going to make my way over

3153
01:56:47.753 --> 01:56:49.106
to let everyone know:

3154
01:56:49.106 --> 01:56:50.713
You guys, you guys,

3155
01:56:50.713 --> 01:56:51.671
I go back in the house,

3156
01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:52.953
Nott's inside.

3157
01:56:52.953 --> 01:56:54.968
TALIESIN: Why would he do that?

3158
01:56:54.968 --> 01:56:55.969
Why would she--

3159
01:56:56.986 --> 01:56:58.150
LAURA: She was invisible,

3160
01:56:58.150 --> 01:56:59.300
she went in by herself.

3161
01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:01.286
She's still in there and the door's shut

3162
01:57:01.286 --> 01:57:03.369
and it's closed.

3163
01:57:03.369 --> 01:57:05.255
LIAM: I've been doing some arcane prep work.

3164
01:57:05.255 --> 01:57:06.960
I cast Mage Armor on myself

3165
01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.932
and then I put a hand on Beauregard and Caduceus' shoulder

3166
01:57:10.932 --> 01:57:14.994
and cast the other dunamantic spell, Gift of Alacrity.

3167
01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:18.145
I mutter a few words and your vision

3168
01:57:18.145 --> 01:57:19.489
like quintuples for a moment

3169
01:57:19.489 --> 01:57:20.773
and just shoots past your eyes

3170
01:57:20.773 --> 01:57:24.506
and now you are going to be able to add 1d8,

3171
01:57:24.506 --> 01:57:26.194
I believe it is, to your initiative rolls

3172
01:57:26.194 --> 01:57:27.329
with whatever happens.
MARISHA: Both of us?

3173
01:57:27.329 --> 01:57:28.300
LIAM: Both of you two.

3174
01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:30.341
MATT and LIAM: For the next eight hours.

3175
01:57:30.341 --> 01:57:31.674
MARISHA: To all rolls?

3176
01:57:31.674 --> 01:57:32.748
MATT: To all of your initiative rolls.

3177
01:57:32.748 --> 01:57:33.874
MARISHA: All initiative rolls?

3178
01:57:33.874 --> 01:57:35.718
LAURA: Balls.
MARISHA: Sick.

3179
01:57:35.718 --> 01:57:38.243
TALIESIN: All initiative rolls now have 1d8.

3180
01:57:38.243 --> 01:57:41.910
MATT: You, technically with those boots, it's a 2d8 bonus.

3181
01:57:45.971 --> 01:57:47.489
LIAM: I have these manacles.

3182
01:57:47.489 --> 01:57:49.684
Maybe we can use them

3183
01:57:49.684 --> 01:57:52.188
on one of them, whoever's in there.

3184
01:57:52.188 --> 01:57:53.881
MARISHA: Oh yeah, hang on, wait, let me see these.

3185
01:57:53.881 --> 01:57:55.089
LIAM: Okay.

3186
01:57:55.089 --> 01:57:59.689
MARISHA: Can I be a dope-ass monk

3187
01:57:59.689 --> 01:58:04.689
and use these chains as improvised monk beating weapons?

3188
01:58:04.931 --> 01:58:05.764
TRAVIS: Nunchucks?

3189
01:58:05.764 --> 01:58:07.058
LIAM: The manacles of stasis.

3190
01:58:07.058 --> 01:58:08.977
MATT: They wouldn't count as monk weapons,

3191
01:58:08.977 --> 01:58:11.651
but you could certainly use them in creative ways

3192
01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:12.503
if you'd like to try.

3193
01:58:12.503 --> 01:58:13.623
LAURA: I have an idea.

3194
01:58:13.623 --> 01:58:16.281
What if we go back in and I try to charm them

3195
01:58:16.281 --> 01:58:18.416
and then they let us put the manacles on them?

3196
01:58:18.416 --> 01:58:20.141
MARISHA: That also works.

3197
01:58:20.141 --> 01:58:21.283
LIAM: For one of them, yeah.

3198
01:58:21.283 --> 01:58:23.442
LAURA: I could charm a couple of them, potentially.

3199
01:58:23.442 --> 01:58:25.083
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the man-- yeah.

3200
01:58:25.083 --> 01:58:27.158
LAURA: Then we can just tie up the other one.

3201
01:58:27.158 --> 01:58:28.408
LIAM: Super cool, good.

3202
01:58:28.408 --> 01:58:29.241
MATT: While this is happening,

3203
01:58:29.241 --> 01:58:33.323
you hear heavy hoof-falls.

3204
01:58:33.323 --> 01:58:34.206
TALIESIN: Up the stairs now?

3205
01:58:34.206 --> 01:58:37.189
MATT: From down this roadway.

3206
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:38.462
TRAVIS: You guys are in the house.

3207
01:58:38.462 --> 01:58:40.642
MATT: You guys are on the back side watching.

3208
01:58:40.642 --> 01:58:42.232
Are you guys doing anything particular?

3209
01:58:42.232 --> 01:58:44.426
You have no indication anything's happening.

3210
01:58:44.426 --> 01:58:46.078
LAURA: Can you send a message?

3211
01:58:46.078 --> 01:58:48.393
Caleb, send a message to Fjord and Yasha

3212
01:58:48.393 --> 01:58:51.590
and let them know what's going on.

3213
01:58:51.590 --> 01:58:54.021
No, Fjord and Yasha are on the other side,

3214
01:58:54.021 --> 01:58:55.023
they're in the alleyway still.

3215
01:58:55.023 --> 01:58:57.532
MATT: Fjord and Yasha, you guys are back here, right?

3216
01:58:57.532 --> 01:58:59.473
That's where you are.

3217
01:58:59.473 --> 01:59:01.131
You guys are just hanging in this alleyway.

3218
01:59:01.131 --> 01:59:02.057
LAURA: Caleb is sending them a message.

3219
01:59:02.057 --> 01:59:03.894
LIAM: Well, Jester elbows the shit out of Caleb,

3220
01:59:03.894 --> 01:59:05.178
I pull out the wire and say:

3221
01:59:05.178 --> 01:59:07.736
We're on the move, things are happening.

3222
01:59:07.736 --> 01:59:10.320
Nott is inside, apparently. Get ready.

3223
01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:12.083
You may reply to this message.

3224
01:59:12.083 --> 01:59:15.556
MATT: A horse you see riding down the road,

3225
01:59:15.556 --> 01:59:19.924
comes to rest alongside the outside of the Overcrow.

3226
01:59:19.924 --> 01:59:20.757
LAURA: Oh no.

3227
01:59:20.757 --> 01:59:24.158
MATT: This very heavily furred waste horse,

3228
01:59:24.158 --> 01:59:26.428
muscular, big, thick fur,

3229
01:59:26.428 --> 01:59:28.280
mane down the back of its neck,

3230
01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.613
big, bushy tail,

3231
01:59:30.953 --> 01:59:32.861
looks exhausted,

3232
01:59:32.861 --> 01:59:34.387
trots up to the exterior.

3233
01:59:34.387 --> 01:59:38.016
The rider is a female copper-scaled dragonborn

3234
01:59:38.016 --> 01:59:41.971
covered in a thick shawl of dull green wool.

3235
01:59:41.971 --> 01:59:43.448
Dismounts the horse and hitches it

3236
01:59:43.448 --> 01:59:45.841
to one of the street side posts over there real fast

3237
01:59:45.841 --> 01:59:47.655
before walking up to the building

3238
01:59:47.655 --> 01:59:50.155
and opens the door and enters.

3239
01:59:51.498 --> 01:59:53.123
Nott, you see this from the top of the stairs.

3240
01:59:53.123 --> 01:59:54.801
You see another figure enter

3241
01:59:54.801 --> 01:59:56.056
and the door close.

3242
01:59:56.056 --> 02:00:00.147
The dragonborn walks up and gives a nod

3243
02:00:00.147 --> 02:00:01.208
to the hobgoblin figure.

3244
02:00:01.208 --> 02:00:03.896
The hobgoblin looks up and down,

3245
02:00:03.896 --> 02:00:04.947
looks over at Maruo.

3246
02:00:04.947 --> 02:00:07.747
Maruo goes, "Can I help you?"

3247
02:00:09.090 --> 02:00:13.090
The dragonborn with barely a glance just goes,

3248
02:00:14.409 --> 02:00:16.068
"Waiting above?"

3249
02:00:17.031 --> 02:00:18.814
TRAVIS: Waiting above.

3250
02:00:18.814 --> 02:00:22.679
MATT: Then tosses a pouch of coin to the goblin who,

3251
02:00:22.679 --> 02:00:24.003
"Right this way."

3252
02:00:24.003 --> 02:00:24.961
SAM: Fuck.

3253
02:00:24.961 --> 02:00:27.959
MATT: The hobgoblin steps aside and the dragonborn begins

3254
02:00:27.959 --> 02:00:29.320
to walk up the stairs to you,

3255
02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:30.320
a little bit quicker,

3256
02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:32.932
seems to have a bit of a haste to the step.

3257
02:00:32.932 --> 02:00:33.969
SAM: They won't be looking for me.

3258
02:00:33.969 --> 02:00:36.837
I'm just going to press myself against a wall.

3259
02:00:36.837 --> 02:00:38.083
MATT: Okay.

3260
02:00:38.083 --> 02:00:39.361
LAURA: Oh god.

3261
02:00:39.361 --> 02:00:40.505
MATT: Go ahead and roll a--

3262
02:00:40.505 --> 02:00:41.892
SAM: The opposite wall that,

3263
02:00:41.892 --> 02:00:43.693
like away from the stairs.

3264
02:00:43.693 --> 02:00:44.567
MATT: You're pretty small.

3265
02:00:44.567 --> 02:00:48.894
I'd say go ahead and make an acrobatics check.

3266
02:00:48.894 --> 02:00:51.727
SAM: Acrobatics check, okay, hold on.

3267
02:00:53.662 --> 02:00:54.766
18.

3268
02:00:54.766 --> 02:00:56.946
MATT: Yeah, you manage to quickly dart out of the way

3269
02:00:56.946 --> 02:00:58.768
and make yourself flat as possible,

3270
02:00:58.768 --> 02:01:00.101
against the side.

3271
02:01:00.101 --> 02:01:02.737
Goes to the door, opens it up and steps inside

3272
02:01:02.737 --> 02:01:03.771
and you hear the voice go--

3273
02:01:03.771 --> 02:01:05.544
SAM: Did they leave the door open for half a second?

3274
02:01:05.544 --> 02:01:08.379
MATT: For like a split second.

3275
02:01:08.379 --> 02:01:11.252
You hear a voice say, "Finally."

3276
02:01:11.252 --> 02:01:13.210
What are you doing?

3277
02:01:13.210 --> 02:01:16.105
SAM: Are they standing in the door or have they gone in?

3278
02:01:16.105 --> 02:01:17.537
Like if I darted it in the door,

3279
02:01:17.537 --> 02:01:19.376
would I maybe make it?

3280
02:01:19.376 --> 02:01:20.209
MATT: Maybe.

3281
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:21.894
SAM: (deep, nervous laughter)

3282
02:01:21.894 --> 02:01:24.211
(laughter)

3283
02:01:24.211 --> 02:01:26.902
ASHLEY: Do it, do it.
SAM: Yeah, sure.

3284
02:01:26.902 --> 02:01:28.455
TRAVIS: Can you not hear through the door,

3285
02:01:28.455 --> 02:01:29.646
the conversation? Do you need to risk it?

3286
02:01:29.646 --> 02:01:31.183
Because you can put your ear up against that bitch!

3287
02:01:31.183 --> 02:01:32.548
SAM: It's true, it's true.
MATT: What are you doing?

3288
02:01:32.548 --> 02:01:34.214
What are you doing? Now's the time,

3289
02:01:34.214 --> 02:01:35.047
you're going to miss it.

3290
02:01:35.047 --> 02:01:36.336
SAM: Fine, I'm going to dart in.

3291
02:01:36.336 --> 02:01:37.338
MATT: All right.

3292
02:01:37.338 --> 02:01:38.794
MARISHA: Come on, rogue shit!

3293
02:01:38.794 --> 02:01:41.404
MATT: Roll another acrobatics check.

3294
02:01:41.404 --> 02:01:44.188
TRAVIS: Oh god, oh god, oh god!
LAURA: Acrobatics.

3295
02:01:44.188 --> 02:01:45.838
SAM: Ew.
LAURA: Okay...

3296
02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:48.613
SAM: 13.

3297
02:01:48.613 --> 02:01:50.197
MATT: 13, okay.

3298
02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:54.471
You try and make your way towards it

3299
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:56.723
and at the last second the door's just closing too quickly.

3300
02:01:56.723 --> 02:01:59.099
You're going to get lodged if you continue forward.

3301
02:01:59.099 --> 02:02:01.429
You stop yourself in the door, closes.

3302
02:02:01.429 --> 02:02:02.714
You don't make it into the chamber.

3303
02:02:02.714 --> 02:02:05.424
TRAVIS: Best outcome possible, best outcome possible.

3304
02:02:05.424 --> 02:02:07.597
LAURA: That is so much better than it could've been.

3305
02:02:07.597 --> 02:02:09.847
MATT: Yeah, yeah it is.

3306
02:02:11.313 --> 02:02:13.877
The door closes.

3307
02:02:13.877 --> 02:02:15.661
LIAM: It could have been if he had rolled a three,

3308
02:02:15.661 --> 02:02:17.018
the door just would've went boop.

3309
02:02:17.018 --> 02:02:18.394
SAM: You know, where I am right now?

3310
02:02:18.394 --> 02:02:19.737
I'm on Nott's Landing.

3311
02:02:19.737 --> 02:02:21.353
(groaning)

3312
02:02:21.353 --> 02:02:22.754
TRAVIS: Out. Get out.

3313
02:02:22.754 --> 02:02:24.146
SAM: It's the worst place in the world!

3314
02:02:24.146 --> 02:02:25.859
LAURA: We need to get in there now.

3315
02:02:25.859 --> 02:02:26.936
It's just getting worse.

3316
02:02:26.936 --> 02:02:28.282
TRAVIS: She can listen through the door.

3317
02:02:28.282 --> 02:02:29.848
MARISHA: Hey, hey, do you have another one

3318
02:02:29.848 --> 02:02:31.072
of those Locate Object spells?

3319
02:02:31.072 --> 02:02:32.954
You want to try and see if that's our guy?

3320
02:02:32.954 --> 02:02:34.417
LAURA: Of course it's our guy.

3321
02:02:34.417 --> 02:02:35.328
MARISHA: I think it's our guy, too.

3322
02:02:35.328 --> 02:02:36.821
LAURA: How could it not be our guy?

3323
02:02:36.821 --> 02:02:38.166
TRAVIS: Because it's a copper-scaled--

3324
02:02:38.166 --> 02:02:39.838
MARISHA: Did it sound like the same accent?

3325
02:02:39.838 --> 02:02:41.454
We don't know, right, we don't know.

3326
02:02:41.454 --> 02:02:45.274
LAURA: I didn't hear the the guy upstairs talking.

3327
02:02:45.274 --> 02:02:47.439
MARISHA: What does she have to do with it, that dragonborn?

3328
02:02:47.439 --> 02:02:49.105
LAURA: Who knows? I can go in.

3329
02:02:49.105 --> 02:02:50.886
I could try to talk to them again

3330
02:02:50.886 --> 02:02:52.696
and then at the last minute Hold Person

3331
02:02:52.696 --> 02:02:54.738
and I can hold them downstairs and we can all rush in

3332
02:02:54.738 --> 02:02:59.237
and just go in and attack and then surprise attack, yeah?

3333
02:02:59.237 --> 02:03:01.668
TRAVIS: No, no, no.
LAURA: Let's do it.

3334
02:03:01.668 --> 02:03:04.937
TRAVIS: No, we have an asset in the field.

3335
02:03:04.937 --> 02:03:06.121
LAURA: We got to do something.

3336
02:03:06.121 --> 02:03:08.371
TRAVIS: Yeah, Nott's there. Let her work.

3337
02:03:10.466 --> 02:03:11.586
LAURA: We have to capture them,

3338
02:03:11.586 --> 02:03:13.095
not let them talk and get away.

3339
02:03:13.095 --> 02:03:14.881
What if they can teleport out?

3340
02:03:14.881 --> 02:03:18.561
TALIESIN: Honestly, I think perhaps they should talk a bit.

3341
02:03:18.561 --> 02:03:20.603
The more that they have a shared story--

3342
02:03:20.603 --> 02:03:21.666
ASHLEY: Did you see anything in the room?

3343
02:03:21.666 --> 02:03:23.124
MATT: So you're listening?

3344
02:03:23.124 --> 02:03:24.335
Roll a perception check

3345
02:03:24.335 --> 02:03:25.418
for me.
SAM: Come on.

3346
02:03:25.418 --> 02:03:27.455
My zero perception.

3347
02:03:27.455 --> 02:03:28.463
Ten.

3348
02:03:28.463 --> 02:03:30.282
MATT: Ten, okay.

3349
02:03:30.282 --> 02:03:31.949
It's pretty muffled.

3350
02:03:32.908 --> 02:03:35.199
The only things you hear,

3351
02:03:35.199 --> 02:03:39.156
it sounds like the scraping of metal across wood,

3352
02:03:39.156 --> 02:03:42.008
like a lot of small pieces of metal.

3353
02:03:42.008 --> 02:03:44.709
This is a sound you're very familiar with.

3354
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:46.935
It's the sound of a lot of coin in its satchel

3355
02:03:46.935 --> 02:03:50.165
being thrown onto a table.

3356
02:03:50.165 --> 02:03:52.624
You hear the muffled voices.

3357
02:03:52.624 --> 02:03:56.549
The only worlds you hear are: "Satisfied?"

3358
02:03:58.241 --> 02:03:59.074
"Very.

3359
02:04:00.531 --> 02:04:03.448
"(mumbles) Bazzoxan."

3360
02:04:05.476 --> 02:04:08.008
"No words, no Bazzoxan.

3361
02:04:08.008 --> 02:04:10.575
"The less I know, the longer I live."

3362
02:04:10.575 --> 02:04:13.742
and then the wood scrape against wood,

3363
02:04:15.247 --> 02:04:18.237
footfalls towards the door.

3364
02:04:18.237 --> 02:04:19.937
SAM: I'm going to get off

3365
02:04:19.937 --> 02:04:23.137
and press myself against the wall again.

3366
02:04:24.038 --> 02:04:26.034
MATT: (grunting)

3367
02:04:26.034 --> 02:04:27.558
SAM: This time, acrobatics?

3368
02:04:27.558 --> 02:04:29.032
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: 22.

3369
02:04:29.032 --> 02:04:30.057
MATT: Yeah, without issue,

3370
02:04:30.057 --> 02:04:30.890
you're just like,

3371
02:04:30.890 --> 02:04:32.605
barely getting yourself in the space.

3372
02:04:32.605 --> 02:04:34.932
The dragonborn is leaving the room.

3373
02:04:34.932 --> 02:04:36.577
Moves past you, closes the door

3374
02:04:36.577 --> 02:04:38.190
and heads down,

3375
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:39.375
hobgoblin moves out of the way.

3376
02:04:39.375 --> 02:04:40.561
Dragonborn leaves.

3377
02:04:40.561 --> 02:04:42.907
You guys watch the dragonborn leave the building.

3378
02:04:42.907 --> 02:04:44.119
LAURA: I'm going to cast Locate Object again

3379
02:04:44.119 --> 02:04:46.531
and try to locate that little thing.

3380
02:04:46.531 --> 02:04:48.300
MATT: On the same book?
LAURA: Yeah.

3381
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:49.166
MATT: Nothing.

3382
02:04:49.166 --> 02:04:52.258
LIAM: I'm going to shunt into Frumpkin and look around.

3383
02:04:52.258 --> 02:04:55.768
Can I see Fjord and Yasha from Frumpkin's position?

3384
02:04:55.768 --> 02:04:56.601
MATT: Yes, very easily.

3385
02:04:56.601 --> 02:04:58.575
LIAM: Is there a window up top?

3386
02:04:58.575 --> 02:04:59.408
MATT: Up top of?

3387
02:04:59.408 --> 02:05:00.696
LIAM: On the second floor of--

3388
02:05:00.696 --> 02:05:02.362
MATT: Back here? No.

3389
02:05:02.362 --> 02:05:04.028
In fact, all the only window is in the very front.

3390
02:05:04.028 --> 02:05:06.569
LIAM: On the very front, okay.

3391
02:05:06.569 --> 02:05:08.710
MATT: The dragonborn exits the building,

3392
02:05:08.710 --> 02:05:10.918
get back up onto the horse,

3393
02:05:10.918 --> 02:05:12.796
give a little bit of food

3394
02:05:12.796 --> 02:05:14.901
and then get up onto the saddle after unhitching it

3395
02:05:14.901 --> 02:05:15.786
and begin to ride away.

3396
02:05:15.786 --> 02:05:19.158
SAM: As the dragonborn exits the house,

3397
02:05:19.158 --> 02:05:23.658
I'm going to break Invisibility, cast Message and say:

3398
02:05:23.658 --> 02:05:26.842
Stop that dragonborn- to Caleb.

3399
02:05:26.842 --> 02:05:27.675
MATT: Okay.

3400
02:05:30.652 --> 02:05:31.487
TALIESIN: That's--

3401
02:05:31.487 --> 02:05:32.324
LIAM: So I heard that.

3402
02:05:32.324 --> 02:05:33.157
TRAVIS: Early in the day.

3403
02:05:35.438 --> 02:05:36.696
MATT: So.

3404
02:05:36.696 --> 02:05:40.558
LIAM: Where's the dragonborn right now on the map?

3405
02:05:40.558 --> 02:05:42.232
Because I heard that obviously.

3406
02:05:42.232 --> 02:05:44.300
MARISHA: That's not who we want, though, right? Yeah.

3407
02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:46.296
TALIESIN: It won't matter, we're in.
ASHLEY: We're in it.

3408
02:05:46.296 --> 02:05:47.866
MATT: The dragonborn.

3409
02:05:47.866 --> 02:05:49.532
We'll say the horse is back here

3410
02:05:49.532 --> 02:05:51.726
and the dragonborn has left and is currently in the process

3411
02:05:51.726 --> 02:05:52.569
of now getting up

3412
02:05:52.569 --> 02:05:53.433
onto the horse.
TRAVIS: He's probably dropping off

3413
02:05:53.433 --> 02:05:57.006
money for the person that's going to come.

3414
02:05:57.006 --> 02:05:59.043
MATT: You have lost your Invisibility

3415
02:05:59.043 --> 02:06:01.988
and you're whispering into this.

3416
02:06:01.988 --> 02:06:05.442
As it happens you hear (creaking)

3417
02:06:05.442 --> 02:06:06.915
and the door opens behind you

3418
02:06:06.915 --> 02:06:10.013
and there you see the the drow that was in the chamber,

3419
02:06:10.013 --> 02:06:11.737
hood back, looking down at you--

3420
02:06:11.737 --> 02:06:12.695
SAM: Drow?

3421
02:06:12.695 --> 02:06:13.874
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Okay.

3422
02:06:13.874 --> 02:06:16.205
MATT: The first one that entered.

3423
02:06:16.205 --> 02:06:18.638
"Interesting."

3424
02:06:18.638 --> 02:06:19.977
And that's where we're going to take a break.

3425
02:06:19.977 --> 02:06:21.512
(groaning)

3426
02:06:21.512 --> 02:06:23.184
MATT: (laughs)

3427
02:06:23.184 --> 02:06:24.350
MARISHA: Which way is the dragonborn riding?

3428
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:25.783
This way past us or away?

3429
02:06:25.783 --> 02:06:27.003
MATT: Just now getting up on the horse

3430
02:06:27.003 --> 02:06:28.007
and looks like they're going to be heading

3431
02:06:28.007 --> 02:06:29.920
back this direction.

3432
02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:33.200
We'll get to that when we come back from our break.

3433
02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:35.415
TALIESIN: Just got to knock the horse out.

3434
02:06:35.415 --> 02:06:39.490
MARISHA: The horse is already 100 feet away from us.

3435
02:06:40.657 --> 02:06:43.621
MATT: We will be back here in a few minutes.

3436
02:06:43.621 --> 02:06:46.312
Before we go away, we do have our Wyrmwood Giveaway

3437
02:06:46.312 --> 02:06:48.687
to pick up where this is about to get real interesting.

3438
02:06:48.687 --> 02:06:50.528
SAM: I don't know who any of these people are!

3439
02:06:50.528 --> 02:06:53.378
MATT: This is the zebrawood Wyrmwood dice box,

3440
02:06:53.378 --> 02:06:54.909
leather interior, nice and awesome.

3441
02:06:54.909 --> 02:06:57.361
It's going to go to one of you lucky winners here.

3442
02:06:57.361 --> 02:07:02.336
Tonight's password is scry, S-R-C-Y, scry.

3443
02:07:03.325 --> 02:07:05.598
Enter it once-- no, it wasn't a hint,

3444
02:07:05.598 --> 02:07:07.630
I usually base it on what happened in a previous episode.

3445
02:07:07.630 --> 02:07:09.437
MARISHA: S-C-R-Y.

3446
02:07:09.437 --> 02:07:10.270
MATT: S-C-R-Y.

3447
02:07:10.270 --> 02:07:11.144
That's not what I said, right?

3448
02:07:11.144 --> 02:07:12.727
MARISHA: It's fine.

3449
02:07:12.727 --> 02:07:13.768
TRAVIS: S-C-R-Y.

3450
02:07:13.768 --> 02:07:16.727
MATT: S-C-R-Y, I apologize, S-C-R-Y.

3451
02:07:18.578 --> 02:07:20.061
It's like there's words in front of me or something.

3452
02:07:20.061 --> 02:07:21.533
Anyway, enter it once.

3453
02:07:21.533 --> 02:07:22.704
More than once, you'll be disqualified.

3454
02:07:22.704 --> 02:07:24.796
Once again, US and Canada only, excluding Quebec.

3455
02:07:24.796 --> 02:07:26.790
We'll have a winner when we come back here in a few minutes.

3456
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:28.207

BRIAN (VO): Last time, on Talks Machina.

3475
02:08:19.554 --> 02:08:22.029
BRIAN: OhNoItsMia has a question for Laura Bailey.

3476
02:08:22.029 --> 02:08:22.862
ASHLEY: Oh no.

3477
02:08:22.862 --> 02:08:25.882
LAURA: There's no more stats? It was just two stats?

3478
02:08:25.882 --> 02:08:27.465
ASHLEY: Listen, I did--

3479
02:08:27.465 --> 02:08:29.325
BRIAN: You want the show to be stats now

3480
02:08:29.325 --> 02:08:32.130
or do you want the people to be able to ask you stuff?

3481
02:08:32.130 --> 02:08:33.624
LAURA: I just thought there would be other stats.

3482
02:08:33.624 --> 02:08:34.626
BRIAN: Ashley, what were you going to say, please?

3483
02:08:34.626 --> 02:08:35.459
ASHLEY: No, I was just going to say,

3484
02:08:35.459 --> 02:08:37.665
I didn't do a whole lot in this episode.

3485
02:08:37.665 --> 02:08:39.399
BRIAN: You were the only other one available tonight

3486
02:08:39.399 --> 02:08:40.232
besides Laura.

3487
02:08:40.232 --> 02:08:42.274
ASHLEY: I was the only one available tonight.

3488
02:08:42.274 --> 02:08:44.882
BRIAN: Everyone else is at Flappers

3489
02:08:44.882 --> 02:08:47.500
getting ready for Joel Hodgson's stream after ours.

3490
02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:48.941
ASHLEY: Everybody was busy, so I'm here,

3491
02:08:48.941 --> 02:08:50.914
so just calm down

3492
02:08:50.914 --> 02:08:51.767
everybody, I know.
LAURA: Also, you just wanted

3493
02:08:51.767 --> 02:08:53.350
to hang out with me.

3494
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:54.370
DANI: Ashley, you're perfect

3495
02:08:54.370 --> 02:08:56.077
and I just want you on the show all the time.

3496
02:08:56.077 --> 02:08:57.226
ASHLEY: Well, thank you, Dani.

3497
02:08:57.226 --> 02:08:58.059
BRIAN: You know what happens

3498
02:08:58.059 --> 02:09:00.922
when I put my shoes up on the couch at home?

3499
02:09:00.922 --> 02:09:02.172
LAURA: What?

3500
02:09:03.139 --> 02:09:03.972
Nothing?

3501
02:09:05.564 --> 02:09:07.544
BRIAN: Don't give me that look because it works.

3502
02:09:07.544 --> 02:09:09.656
Naomi Andrews wants to know,

3503
02:09:09.656 --> 02:09:11.288
"It was very nice and fitting

3504
02:09:11.288 --> 02:09:14.780
"that Yasha got the room with the balcony.

3505
02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:17.474
"After her last interaction with the Stormlord,

3506
02:09:17.474 --> 02:09:19.330
"actually having a conversation,

3507
02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:23.547
"is Yasha looking forward to communing with her god more?"

3508
02:09:23.547 --> 02:09:24.630
ASHLEY: Definitely.

3509
02:09:26.452 --> 02:09:31.437
I think the choice for the balcony was a couple reasons.

3510
02:09:31.437 --> 02:09:34.153
BRIAN: Laura!
LAURA: I'm sorry!

3511
02:09:34.153 --> 02:09:36.076
BRIAN: I can't fucking believe this.

3512
02:09:36.076 --> 02:09:38.072
Can we have one episode?

3513
02:09:38.072 --> 02:09:40.197
LAURA: I can't help it.

3514
02:09:40.197 --> 02:09:42.221
I forgot.
ASHLEY: It's fine.

3515
02:09:42.221 --> 02:09:43.544
BRIAN: You can restart if you want,

3516
02:09:43.544 --> 02:09:45.197
we will edit this out.

3517
02:09:45.197 --> 02:09:46.722
Steve, we can take care of this, right?

3518
02:09:46.722 --> 02:09:48.184
LAURA: We were talking about the Stormlord.

3519
02:09:48.184 --> 02:09:52.397
ASHLEY: Well, I think that the choice for the balcony

3520
02:09:52.397 --> 02:09:53.570
was for a couple reasons

3521
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:56.278
because, you know, sleeping in a home

3522
02:09:56.278 --> 02:09:57.239
and under a roof like that

3523
02:09:57.239 --> 02:09:59.640
is obviously a very new thing for Yasha.

3524
02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:03.373
I think it's,

3525
02:10:04.596 --> 02:10:06.498
hopefully, I think it's one of those things

3526
02:10:06.498 --> 02:10:08.139
of not wanting to get claustrophobic.

3527
02:10:08.139 --> 02:10:10.273
So she can always just go outside if she needs to.

3528
02:10:10.273 --> 02:10:14.061
Also, from experience,

3529
02:10:14.061 --> 02:10:16.173
from what she knows up until this point

3530
02:10:16.173 --> 02:10:19.746
is that she communes with her god outside,

3531
02:10:19.746 --> 02:10:21.154
he's an outside god.

3532
02:10:21.154 --> 02:10:22.232
As far as she knows.

3533
02:10:22.232 --> 02:10:23.980
She's like I don't know if he comes indoors.

3534
02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:25.101
♪ Sensual seduction ♪

3535
02:10:25.101 --> 02:10:27.741
LAURA: Okay, so here's the thing, right,

3536
02:10:27.741 --> 02:10:31.282
this is actually, should I explain all this?

3537
02:10:31.282 --> 02:10:32.317
DANI: Yes.

3538
02:10:32.317 --> 02:10:33.725
ASHLEY: Do it, do it.

3539
02:10:33.725 --> 02:10:35.828
BRIAN: If you don't, I'm staying.

3540
02:10:35.828 --> 02:10:37.287
LAURA: Oh, okay.

3541
02:10:38.721 --> 02:10:41.780
So like Fjord, okay,

3542
02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:43.548
so I feel like Jester's really like

3543
02:10:43.548 --> 02:10:47.882
been very forward with Fjord and you know

3544
02:10:47.882 --> 02:10:52.531
and he hasn't returned any of those flirtations--

3545
02:10:52.531 --> 02:10:54.652
things that she thinks are flirtations.

3546
02:10:54.652 --> 02:10:55.868
Whether or not he understands it

3547
02:10:55.868 --> 02:10:57.403
or he's not interested, whatever,

3548
02:10:57.403 --> 02:11:00.293
but there was definitely this friendly banter

3549
02:11:00.293 --> 02:11:03.185
between them earlier on that kind of drifted away

3550
02:11:03.185 --> 02:11:05.451
when we were at sea.

3551
02:11:05.451 --> 02:11:07.014
She doesn't,

3552
02:11:07.014 --> 02:11:08.188
he hasn't been talking to anybody

3553
02:11:08.188 --> 02:11:10.001
about the turmoil he's been going through

3554
02:11:10.001 --> 02:11:11.834
and any of that stuff.

3555
02:11:12.764 --> 02:11:17.764
So I'm kind of backing it off in those terms with her

3556
02:11:17.956 --> 02:11:19.014
like she's not going to be,

3557
02:11:19.014 --> 02:11:21.116
and plus having the realization

3558
02:11:21.116 --> 02:11:25.584
that all romances are not what you read in the books,

3559
02:11:25.584 --> 02:11:26.917
you know?

3560
02:11:26.917 --> 02:11:29.018
So she's kind of coming to these terms

3561
02:11:29.018 --> 02:11:32.689
of like, "Maybe I don't understand what

3562
02:11:32.689 --> 02:11:33.897
"it is

3563
02:11:33.897 --> 02:11:37.177
"and how other people feel and how I feel,

3564
02:11:37.177 --> 02:11:38.923
"I don't know any of those things."

3565
02:11:38.923 --> 02:11:41.204
BRIAN: You make your own fairy tale.

3566
02:11:41.204 --> 02:11:42.368
That's what you do.

3567
02:11:42.368 --> 02:11:44.305
LAURA: Well, <i>I</i> know these things,

3568
02:11:44.305 --> 02:11:46.641
but Jester doesn't know these things.

3569
02:11:46.641 --> 02:11:47.947
So yeah, in that moment--
BRIAN: But I'm telling

3570
02:11:47.947 --> 02:11:49.989
the actor who portrays her--

3571
02:11:49.989 --> 02:11:51.672
LAURA: (laughs) So in that moment,

3572
02:11:51.672 --> 02:11:55.139
when he's actively seducing somebody

3573
02:11:55.139 --> 02:11:58.776
and was playing up the whole storybook romance,

3574
02:11:58.776 --> 02:12:01.027
all of her romance novels that she's been reading

3575
02:12:01.027 --> 02:12:02.318
and he's acting like that,

3576
02:12:02.318 --> 02:12:04.235
she very much was just,

3577
02:12:05.704 --> 02:12:07.800
I said it, it was heart eyes the whole time.

3578
02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:11.093
Just like the little drool coming out of her mouth probably,

3579
02:12:11.093 --> 02:12:12.867
but trying to be subtle about it

3580
02:12:12.867 --> 02:12:15.011
and not succeeding in any way, yeah.

3581
02:12:15.011 --> 02:12:16.493
DANI: He's flirted with her a little bit.

3582
02:12:16.493 --> 02:12:17.326
LAURA: He's flirted.

3583
02:12:17.326 --> 02:12:19.768
He's trying, I think.
DANI: He's done a little bit.

3584
02:12:19.768 --> 02:12:21.592
LAURA: But Jester doesn't get it anymore.

3585
02:12:21.592 --> 02:12:23.939
I think it's just been so many times of like

3586
02:12:23.939 --> 02:12:25.496
Fjord shutting it down,

3587
02:12:25.496 --> 02:12:29.518
that now she's like, "I don't know how to react anymore

3588
02:12:29.518 --> 02:12:30.352
"with this."

3589
02:12:30.352 --> 02:12:32.518
DANI: (fake sobbing)

3590
02:12:32.518 --> 02:12:35.318
ASHLEY: Stop it. Put your hands down and close your eyes.

3591
02:12:35.318 --> 02:12:36.814
Stop opening your eyes.

3592
02:12:36.814 --> 02:12:38.408
LAURA: Careful because the buttons could hurt.

3593
02:12:38.408 --> 02:12:40.658
ASHLEY: Close your eyes.

3594
02:12:42.037 --> 02:12:44.779
Trust me, I'm your fiancée.
LAURA: Just keep your hands

3595
02:12:44.779 --> 02:12:47.029
(laughter)

3596
02:12:52.608 --> 02:12:55.916
TRAVIS (VO): Last time on Yee-haw Game Ranch.

3597
02:12:55.916 --> 02:12:59.032
LAURA and ASHLEY: (southern accent) Well, hell.

3598
02:12:59.032 --> 02:13:03.456
LAURA: Welcome back to Laura Bailey's Yee-haw Game Ranch.

3599
02:13:03.456 --> 02:13:06.072
MARISHA: "Welcome back, boys.

3600
02:13:06.072 --> 02:13:08.387
"Yee-haw!"

3601
02:13:08.387 --> 02:13:10.735
LAURA: Oh, oh wow.

3602
02:13:10.735 --> 02:13:12.014
What's your name?

3603
02:13:12.014 --> 02:13:14.243
MARISHA: "Well, you're not the Realmwalker

3604
02:13:14.243 --> 02:13:17.068
"and you're not his disgusting, rotten,

3605
02:13:17.068 --> 02:13:19.352
"piece of asparagus sidekick."

3606
02:13:19.352 --> 02:13:20.216
ASHLEY: Whoa.

3607
02:13:20.216 --> 02:13:21.666
MARISHA: "Oh, I'm sorry.

3608
02:13:21.666 --> 02:13:23.916
"I'm Root N Toot N Ruby,

3609
02:13:23.916 --> 02:13:27.586
"the Oracle of the 12 realms."

3610
02:13:27.586 --> 02:13:29.720
ASHLEY: Wait, who are you looking for?

3611
02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:32.174
Because you mentioned a Realmwalker.

3612
02:13:32.174 --> 02:13:33.382
Who is that?

3613
02:13:33.382 --> 02:13:36.439
MARISHA: "Oh, don't you sugar-covered dandelions

3614
02:13:36.439 --> 02:13:37.998
"worry about that none.

3615
02:13:37.998 --> 02:13:40.547
"It's just an age-old prophecy

3616
02:13:40.547 --> 02:13:43.797
"of the one who can walk between realms,

3617
02:13:45.069 --> 02:13:49.152
"an almighty being that charges all 12 game souls,

02:13:50.915 --> 02:13:55.532
"the great prophet that fuses and shattered worlds together

3619
02:13:55.532 --> 02:13:59.859
"and brings peace to the gameverse."

3620
02:13:59.859 --> 02:14:03.208
ASHLEY: That does sound like a little too much tar

3621
02:14:03.208 --> 02:14:05.053
for our wagon wheels.

3622
02:14:05.053 --> 02:14:07.912
Wait, but hold on, who was that sidekick

3623
02:14:07.912 --> 02:14:11.364
you were talking about, who?

3624
02:14:11.364 --> 02:14:13.864
MARISHA: "That's the liability.

3625
02:14:15.227 --> 02:14:18.488
"He's a disgusting man with flesh-colored beard.

3626
02:14:18.488 --> 02:14:20.077
"He will probably die alone

3627
02:14:20.077 --> 02:14:22.317
"because no one wants to hitch their wagon

3628
02:14:22.317 --> 02:14:26.435
"to a two-legged horse with macular degeneration

02:14:26.435 --> 02:14:28.577
"and permanent resting bitch face."

3630
02:14:28.577 --> 02:14:30.552
LAURA: That is terrible.
ASHLEY: That is harsh.

3631
02:14:30.552 --> 02:14:34.877
Man, he sounds like a trough filled with shit.

3632
02:14:34.877 --> 02:14:35.981
MARISHA: "Love you, bye."

3633
02:14:35.981 --> 02:14:36.928
ASHLEY: I'm coming, I'm coming.

3634
02:14:36.928 --> 02:14:38.011
LAURA: Kill the aliens.

3635
02:14:38.011 --> 02:14:40.556
ASHLEY: I'm just going to hit these trash cans and this--

3636
02:14:40.556 --> 02:14:41.389
LAURA: I'm alone!

3637
02:14:41.389 --> 02:14:43.650
Oh no, it's getting me, no!

3638
02:14:43.650 --> 02:14:46.916
Oh no, no, no!
ASHLEY: Oh, head-on collision.

3639
02:14:46.916 --> 02:14:48.999
Here I come, here I come.

3640
02:14:48.999 --> 02:14:50.207
Wait, where are you?

3641
02:14:50.207 --> 02:14:51.107
LAURA: I'm over here.

3642
02:14:51.107 --> 02:14:52.728
ASHLEY: Oh, why am I going in the house?

3643
02:14:52.728 --> 02:14:54.371
LAURA: Oh my god, there's so many aliens.

3644
02:14:54.371 --> 02:14:55.930
When you do the cheeto thing,

3645
02:14:55.930 --> 02:14:57.987
according to Travis,

3646
02:14:57.987 --> 02:15:01.019
you have to do it with your arm extended.

3647
02:15:01.019 --> 02:15:02.860
ASHLEY: Oh, you do? That's what I'm doing wrong?

3648
02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.660
LAURA: Then you have to flip it into your mouth.

3649
02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:06.893
ASHLEY: I'm going to make sure I hit everything.

3650
02:15:06.893 --> 02:15:09.757
I'm taking out all of the newspaper stands

3651
02:15:09.757 --> 02:15:12.211
because, as they say, print is dead.

3652
02:15:12.211 --> 02:15:13.044
So...

3653
02:15:16.551 --> 02:15:18.718
LAURA: You lulled me into safety.

3654
02:15:20.531 --> 02:15:22.531

02:15:29.352 --> 02:15:32.269
I'm making so much money right now.

3658
02:15:34.070 --> 02:15:37.011
ASHLEY: Goddamn it, I'm so bad at this.

3659
02:15:37.011 --> 02:15:39.496
Turn the fuck around.

02:15:57.373 --> 02:15:59.293
LAURA: You're welcome.

3667
02:15:59.293 --> 02:16:01.683
Nobody hurts my bitch

3668
02:16:01.683 --> 02:16:02.792
and gets away with it.

3669
02:16:02.792 --> 02:16:03.625
ASHLEY: Back up.

3670
02:16:03.625 --> 02:16:04.458
LAURA: If anybody makes

3671
02:16:04.458 --> 02:16:07.145
women driving jokes after this episode,

3672
02:16:07.145 --> 02:16:08.264
you can suck it.
ASHLEY: Listen,

3673
02:16:08.264 --> 02:16:11.322
I am doing a three point turn here

3674
02:16:11.322 --> 02:16:13.427
fantastically,

3675
02:16:13.427 --> 02:16:15.432
and there we go,

3676
02:16:15.432 --> 02:16:16.680
not worried about it,

3677
02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:18.259
getting past traffic,

3678
02:16:18.259 --> 02:16:20.187
going to make a right right here

3679
02:16:20.187 --> 02:16:21.428
and then I'm going to go down--

3680
02:16:21.428 --> 02:16:22.319
LAURA: Can I shoot out the window

3681
02:16:22.319 --> 02:16:23.527
while you're driving?

3682
02:16:23.527 --> 02:16:24.360
ASHLEY: Try it.

3683
02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:26.109
LAURA: I can!

3684
02:16:26.109 --> 02:16:27.382
ASHLEY: Oop, here come the cop.

3685
02:16:27.382 --> 02:16:28.461
LAURA: Eat it, coppers.

3686
02:16:28.461 --> 02:16:30.605
ASHLEY: Look how cute you are.

3687
02:16:30.605 --> 02:16:31.605
Burning Man!

3688
02:16:34.067 --> 02:16:37.848
Do people shoot at you if you're streaking?

3689
02:16:37.848 --> 02:16:39.341
Can I not shoot if I'm streaking?

3690
02:16:39.341 --> 02:16:41.482
Oh, I can't shoot at anybody if I'm streaking.

3691
02:16:41.482 --> 02:16:42.315
ASHLEY: Let's go stand in the light.

3692
02:16:42.315 --> 02:16:43.928
LAURA: Look at how happy she is

3693
02:16:43.928 --> 02:16:45.928
as she's running around.

3694
02:16:52.528 --> 02:16:55.705
MATT: (grunting)

3695
02:16:55.705 --> 02:16:57.350
"Oh,

3696
02:16:57.350 --> 02:16:59.066
"would you look at that?

3697
02:16:59.066 --> 02:17:00.490
"I think it worked.

3698
02:17:00.490 --> 02:17:01.914
"You were right, Pumat Number 3,

3699
02:17:01.914 --> 02:17:06.234
"all we had to do is invoke that subscription cantrip.

3700
02:17:06.234 --> 02:17:08.467
"Pumat Number 3?

02:17:10.647 --> 02:17:11.480
"Oh boy,

02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:12.762
"well hello there,

02:17:12.762 --> 02:17:14.762
"I'm Pumat Prime.

"oh, we're on the Critical Role channel, aren't we?

3708
02:17:27.162 --> 02:17:28.602
"Well, would you look at that?

3709
02:17:28.602 --> 02:17:30.503
"You got chat and everything.

3710
02:17:30.503 --> 02:17:34.823
"Respectfully, I was looking for the Prime Rib Realm,

3711
02:17:34.823 --> 02:17:37.434
"but this isn't too bad.

3712
02:17:37.434 --> 02:17:39.466
"You see, if you already have access

TALIESIN (VO): Subscribe.

3735
02:18:32.794 --> 02:18:34.169
Resubscribe.

3736
02:18:36.071 --> 02:18:39.021
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

3737
02:18:43.368 --> 02:18:46.118
[dramatic music]

3738
02:31:16.437 --> 02:31:18.216
MATT: Welcome back.
TRAVIS: Nobody said anything.

3739
02:31:18.216 --> 02:31:20.026
MATT: Yeah, it was great.

3740
02:31:20.026 --> 02:31:21.786
They were actually quiet this time, good job.

3741
02:31:21.786 --> 02:31:22.619
Welcome back.

3742
02:31:22.619 --> 02:31:23.452
Before we jump into this cluster fluffer--

3743
02:31:27.752 --> 02:31:28.594
TALIESIN: Cluster fluffer.

3744
02:31:28.594 --> 02:31:29.744
MATT: There you go.
MARISHA: I need a Nutter Butter.

3745
02:31:29.744 --> 02:31:33.502
MATT: I know. Fluffernutter. We have our winner.

3746
02:31:33.502 --> 02:31:36.090
The winner of our giveaway of the Wyrmwood piece

3747
02:31:36.090 --> 02:31:37.799
is Keegan Hanson.

3748
02:31:37.799 --> 02:31:39.434
Keegan Hanson, congratulations.

3749
02:31:39.434 --> 02:31:41.708
We will get that sent to you ASAP.

3750
02:31:41.708 --> 02:31:43.727
Well done.

3751
02:31:43.727 --> 02:31:46.487
So where we left off--

3752
02:31:46.487 --> 02:31:47.578
SAM: Oh god.
TALIESIN: Damn it.

3753
02:31:47.578 --> 02:31:48.794
TRAVIS: Come on, we got this, wing it.

3754
02:31:48.794 --> 02:31:50.426
If we fuck it up, we'll just leave the Empire

3755
02:31:50.426 --> 02:31:51.527
or the Dynasty, it's fine.

3756
02:31:51.527 --> 02:31:52.890
LAURA: They're how far away from us right now?

3757
02:31:52.890 --> 02:31:55.660
Like 100 feet, is that 100 feet?

3758
02:31:55.660 --> 02:31:57.786
MATT: As you guys are looking through this side window,

3759
02:31:57.786 --> 02:32:00.218
you watch through that side there

3760
02:32:00.218 --> 02:32:01.882
from where you can view.

3761
02:32:01.882 --> 02:32:04.554
MARISHA: It was a male drow, right?

3762
02:32:04.554 --> 02:32:05.387
LAURA: Yes.

3763
02:32:05.387 --> 02:32:06.650
MATT: Male drow, female dragonborn,

3764
02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:08.567
as far as you can tell.

3765
02:32:10.139 --> 02:32:13.690
The dragonborn is up on the horse after unhitching it

3766
02:32:13.690 --> 02:32:16.242
and is getting ready to start riding that direction.

3767
02:32:16.242 --> 02:32:17.306
LAURA: They're already on the horse?

3768
02:32:17.306 --> 02:32:18.858
MATT: They have unhitched it

3769
02:32:18.858 --> 02:32:19.928
and got up onto the horse.

3770
02:32:19.928 --> 02:32:21.107
LAURA: We run out, right?

3771
02:32:21.107 --> 02:32:22.602
LIAM: Well, I tell the group quietly:

3772
02:32:22.602 --> 02:32:23.882
Nott said stop that dragonborn,

3773
02:32:23.882 --> 02:32:25.544
we have to get there.

3774
02:32:25.544 --> 02:32:26.826
Jester, can you get us there?

3775
02:32:26.826 --> 02:32:27.659
Can you get us there?

3776
02:32:27.659 --> 02:32:28.492
LAURA: Yeah.

3777
02:32:28.492 --> 02:32:30.346
I open the door and start running out towards the horse.

3778
02:32:30.346 --> 02:32:31.786
MARISHA: Wait, what, wait?

3779
02:32:31.786 --> 02:32:33.436
MATT: All right, so

3780
02:32:34.761 --> 02:32:36.498
let's roll initiative

3781
02:32:36.498 --> 02:32:37.850
because we are now engaged.

3782
02:32:37.850 --> 02:32:38.774
TRAVIS: Is it just the people in this house

3783
02:32:38.774 --> 02:32:40.320
or is it us as well in the back?

3784
02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:42.578
MATT: It's you guys in the back as well.

3785
02:32:42.578 --> 02:32:43.861
But you haven't been notified.

3786
02:32:43.861 --> 02:32:45.638
You guys are just out there still waiting.

3787
02:32:45.638 --> 02:32:46.534
You're like, huh?

3788
02:32:46.534 --> 02:32:47.367
LIAM: There's just death.

3789
02:32:47.367 --> 02:32:50.054
TRAVIS: You got 1d8 to your fucking initiative shit.

3790
02:32:50.054 --> 02:32:51.702
LIAM: Yeah, you too, Cad.

3791
02:32:51.702 --> 02:32:54.008
MARISHA: I haven't forgotten.

3792
02:32:54.008 --> 02:32:55.258
Thank god, too.

3793
02:32:56.523 --> 02:32:58.229
LIAM: So 1d8 plus 1d8?

3794
02:32:58.229 --> 02:32:59.320
TALIESIN: No, I don't want to be this high

3795
02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:00.403
in the initiative stack.

3796
02:33:00.403 --> 02:33:03.458
LAURA: I wish I could've taken that.
MARISHA: I get to do that once

3797
02:33:03.458 --> 02:33:04.470
LIAM: Seems like a good time.

3798
02:33:04.470 --> 02:33:05.975
LAURA: Yeah, do it.

3799
02:33:05.975 --> 02:33:08.068
Probably you're only going to get--

3800
02:33:08.068 --> 02:33:10.371
MARISHA: 14 plus four is 18.
TRAVIS: Once a day?

3801
02:33:10.371 --> 02:33:11.357
I thought it was--

3802
02:33:11.357 --> 02:33:12.690
MARISHA: Well, my boots.

3803
02:33:14.781 --> 02:33:15.622
MATT: Got it.

3804
02:33:15.622 --> 02:33:17.539
All right, so 25 to 20?

3805
02:33:18.405 --> 02:33:19.238
TALIESIN: 24.

3806
02:33:19.238 --> 02:33:20.446
MARISHA: 21.

3807
02:33:20.446 --> 02:33:25.236
MATT: All right, so we have Caduceus followed by Beau.

3808
02:33:25.236 --> 02:33:26.069
TALIESIN: Damn it.

3809
02:33:29.844 --> 02:33:31.046
MATT: Wait, and Beau, you were what?

3810
02:33:31.046 --> 02:33:33.037
MARISHA: 21.
MATT: 21, okay.

3811
02:33:38.197 --> 02:33:39.463
TRAVIS: [inaudible] fucking roll high.

3812
02:33:40.379 --> 02:33:41.743
MATT: 20 to 15.

3813
02:33:41.743 --> 02:33:42.576
LIAM: 18.

3814
02:33:43.775 --> 02:33:44.741
ASHLEY: Oh no.

3815
02:33:44.741 --> 02:33:45.574
MARISHA: Wait, I'm going to be--

3816
02:33:46.559 --> 02:33:48.309
SAM: Oh, 15. Sorry, 15.

3817
02:33:49.412 --> 02:33:50.374
LAURA: Did it count for anything?

3818
02:33:50.374 --> 02:33:53.302
MATT: Jester would be through this door

3819
02:33:53.302 --> 02:33:54.406
and just stepping outside

3820
02:33:54.406 --> 02:33:55.670
at this point, I'll say.

3821
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:56.646
MARISHA: I'm sorry, Matt.

3822
02:33:56.646 --> 02:33:58.598
I forgot to add my actual initiative.

3823
02:33:58.598 --> 02:34:00.230
I'm actually 26.

3824
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:02.563
MATT: Okay, so Beau is up first.

3825
02:34:03.430 --> 02:34:05.396
MARISHA: I was too busy counting dice.

3826
02:34:05.396 --> 02:34:06.678
MATT: It's okay.

3827
02:34:06.678 --> 02:34:08.518
So Caleb, is anybody else?

3828
02:34:08.518 --> 02:34:10.685
SAM: 15, sorry.
MATT: 15 for Nott.

3829
02:34:12.189 --> 02:34:13.647
15 to ten?

3830
02:34:13.647 --> 02:34:15.605
ASHLEY: 11.
LAURA: Oh seven.

3831
02:34:15.605 --> 02:34:17.605
MATT: Hold on, 11 for Yasha.

3832
02:34:21.267 --> 02:34:22.630
LAURA: No, that's below ten.

3833
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:23.463
MATT: What'd you get?

3834
02:34:23.463 --> 02:34:24.296
TRAVIS: Five.

3835
02:34:27.546 --> 02:34:28.662
MATT: Okay.

3836
02:34:28.662 --> 02:34:33.253
So Beau, technically, you have initiative.

3837
02:34:33.253 --> 02:34:34.211
From inside the building,

3838
02:34:34.211 --> 02:34:36.022
Jester just pushed the door open

3839
02:34:36.022 --> 02:34:38.819
and ran out into the center of the main street.

3840
02:34:38.819 --> 02:34:42.515
All you've heard is what you've heard from Caleb

3841
02:34:42.515 --> 02:34:44.054
giving Nott's message.

3842
02:34:44.054 --> 02:34:44.887
What are you doing?

3843
02:34:44.887 --> 02:34:45.720
LAURA: I'm still the drow, right?

3844
02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:47.302
It hadn't been an hour since I went in?

3845
02:34:47.302 --> 02:34:48.135
MATT: Correct.

3846
02:34:52.393 --> 02:34:53.976
TRAVIS: Kick us off, man.

3847
02:34:57.225 --> 02:34:59.030
MARISHA: I-- fuck me.

3848
02:34:59.030 --> 02:35:02.693
Can I acrobatics through this window?

3849
02:35:02.693 --> 02:35:04.677
Am I dope enough to do that?

3850
02:35:04.677 --> 02:35:05.651
MATT: You can totally do that.

3851
02:35:05.651 --> 02:35:07.253
MARISHA: I go through here.

3852
02:35:07.253 --> 02:35:08.499
MATT: Make an acrobats check.

3853
02:35:08.499 --> 02:35:11.443
You basically just look and then leap through

3854
02:35:11.443 --> 02:35:12.614
and tumble past.

3855
02:35:12.614 --> 02:35:16.322
TALIESIN: That's a way to do it.
MARISHA: That's good.

3856
02:35:16.322 --> 02:35:17.280
27.

3857
02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:20.561
MATT: Yeah, you completely soar over these boxes.

3858
02:35:20.561 --> 02:35:21.606
They don't reduce your speed at all.

3859
02:35:21.606 --> 02:35:23.030
You're just tumbling and rolling

3860
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:25.027
and using the momentum to continue forward.

3861
02:35:25.027 --> 02:35:29.125
So 15, you land there.

3862
02:35:29.125 --> 02:35:30.246
15 feet of movement.

3863
02:35:30.246 --> 02:35:31.446
MARISHA: That was 15.

3864
02:35:31.446 --> 02:35:32.279
MATT: Correct.

3865
02:35:32.279 --> 02:35:35.174
MARISHA: I'm going to run the rest of my speed

3866
02:35:35.174 --> 02:35:37.766
and I'm going to dart catty-corner

3867
02:35:37.766 --> 02:35:39.158
to this pocket over here.

3868
02:35:39.158 --> 02:35:40.454
As I'm going,

3869
02:35:40.454 --> 02:35:42.326
I want to get out one of my cherry bombs.

3870
02:35:42.326 --> 02:35:43.958
MATT: 45, your speed?

3871
02:35:43.958 --> 02:35:45.366
MARISHA: Yeah, 45, yes.

3872
02:35:45.366 --> 02:35:47.030
MATT: That's as far as you get with your movement.

3873
02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:49.651
MARISHA: I want to get out one of my cherry bombs

3874
02:35:49.651 --> 02:35:51.494
and light it and throw it,

3875
02:35:51.494 --> 02:35:54.299
see if I can throw it underneath the horse.

3876
02:35:54.299 --> 02:35:55.228
MATT: Okay.

3877
02:35:55.228 --> 02:35:57.651
One of the firecrackers from Hupperdook?

3878
02:35:57.651 --> 02:35:58.742
You got it.

3879
02:35:58.742 --> 02:36:00.198
You use your action to throw.

3880
02:36:00.198 --> 02:36:01.941
Go ahead and make an--

3881
02:36:01.941 --> 02:36:03.274
MARISHA: -- anything else. Startle him.

3882
02:36:03.274 --> 02:36:05.305
MATT: Make an--

3883
02:36:05.305 --> 02:36:06.310
go ahead and make an attack roll.

3884
02:36:06.310 --> 02:36:07.750
Roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

3885
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:10.167
TRAVIS: Hope that's not a warhorse.

3886
02:36:11.844 --> 02:36:12.677
MARISHA: My dex mod?

3887
02:36:12.677 --> 02:36:13.760
MATT: Yes.

3888
02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:16.048
MARISHA: Oh thank god, that was almost bad.

3889
02:36:16.048 --> 02:36:19.510
Whew, 19. My fucking heart.

3890
02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:20.818
MATT: So you pull it out.

3891
02:36:20.818 --> 02:36:22.527
As you're running, getting it,

3892
02:36:22.527 --> 02:36:24.070
and you stumble, roll to the ground,

3893
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:25.600
use momentum to move forward, pull it out,

3894
02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:29.455
getting your flint out, throw it.

3895
02:36:29.455 --> 02:36:32.163
(rolling and bouncing)

3896
02:36:32.163 --> 02:36:33.197
(explosion)

3897
02:36:33.197 --> 02:36:34.278
It sends off sparks

3898
02:36:34.278 --> 02:36:36.612
and a loud series of bangs from inside,

3899
02:36:36.612 --> 02:36:38.384
the horse gets up.

3900
02:36:38.384 --> 02:36:40.213
When it gets to its turn,

3901
02:36:40.213 --> 02:36:41.350
we're going to see if the dragonborn

3902
02:36:41.350 --> 02:36:42.451
can try and keep it under control,

3903
02:36:42.451 --> 02:36:44.804
but that horse is sufficiently spooked.

3904
02:36:44.804 --> 02:36:46.590
MARISHA: Do I have a dash that I can do?

3905
02:36:46.590 --> 02:36:48.173
MATT: You have your bonus action.
MARISHA: A bonus action?

3906
02:36:48.173 --> 02:36:50.806
Can just leap and tumble

3907
02:36:50.806 --> 02:36:51.811
and see if I can like--

3908
02:36:51.811 --> 02:36:53.382
MATT: If you use a ki point to Step of the Wind,

3909
02:36:53.382 --> 02:36:54.516
you can try.
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

3910
02:36:54.516 --> 02:36:56.035
MATT: Because yeah, your action movement's done.

3911
02:36:56.035 --> 02:36:56.934
So whatever your bonus action is.

3912
02:36:56.934 --> 02:36:59.334
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to do that.

3913
02:36:59.334 --> 02:37:00.337
I'm going to Step the Wind

3914
02:37:00.337 --> 02:37:04.920
and try and get behind and hunker down over

3915
02:37:05.989 --> 02:37:07.988
and get down and try and get out of sight

3916
02:37:07.988 --> 02:37:11.382
and hope that that was as stealthy as I thought it was

3917
02:37:11.382 --> 02:37:13.645
in my head.
MATT: You haven't hidden yet

3918
02:37:13.645 --> 02:37:15.503
because you had no action left to hide,

3919
02:37:15.503 --> 02:37:16.571
but you did make your way over there.

3920
02:37:16.571 --> 02:37:18.074
Next turn, you'll be able to hide.

3921
02:37:18.074 --> 02:37:20.785
You just dart through quickly.

3922
02:37:20.785 --> 02:37:22.139
That's your turn.

3923
02:37:22.139 --> 02:37:23.249
Beauregard, you're finished,

3924
02:37:23.249 --> 02:37:25.207
Caduceus, you're up next.

3925
02:37:25.207 --> 02:37:27.290
TALIESIN: Okay, okay, okay, fine.

3926
02:37:29.514 --> 02:37:31.355
MATT: You watch both Jester dart out

3927
02:37:31.355 --> 02:37:33.393
and then Beau just jump through the window.

3928
02:37:33.393 --> 02:37:34.976
What are you doing?

3929
02:37:36.543 --> 02:37:39.052
TALIESIN: I'm going to

3930
02:37:40.971 --> 02:37:44.792
take my action to Disguise Self.

3931
02:37:44.792 --> 02:37:45.683
MATT: Okay.

3932
02:37:45.683 --> 02:37:50.075
TALIESIN: I'm going to look like my lanky farmer drow

3933
02:37:50.075 --> 02:37:51.089
which I've been playing with.

3934
02:37:51.089 --> 02:37:51.922
MATT: Okay.

3935
02:37:53.022 --> 02:37:53.855
TALIESIN: And...

3936
02:37:56.613 --> 02:37:58.055
I'm going to

3937
02:37:59.843 --> 02:38:02.673
head in that direction 30 feet

3938
02:38:02.673 --> 02:38:05.924
and see if I can start waving down the rest of the kids.

3939
02:38:05.924 --> 02:38:08.390
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30.

3940
02:38:08.390 --> 02:38:09.905
Okay, there is that slight gap

3941
02:38:09.905 --> 02:38:11.313
between the buildings right there.

3942
02:38:11.313 --> 02:38:12.774
You can just see that it's about,

3943
02:38:12.774 --> 02:38:13.607
it's a little under a foot.

3944
02:38:13.607 --> 02:38:14.440
It's a tight squeeze,

3945
02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:15.430
especially for someone of your stature.

3946
02:38:15.430 --> 02:38:17.096
You're thin, you're just tall.

3947
02:38:17.096 --> 02:38:17.929
You might be able to try,

3948
02:38:17.929 --> 02:38:19.403
but you'll have to get over there to try it.

3949
02:38:19.403 --> 02:38:20.518
That's your movement and your action.

3950
02:38:20.518 --> 02:38:21.776
TALIESIN: There's not a window on the second floor

3951
02:38:21.776 --> 02:38:23.861
facing that direction?

3952
02:38:23.861 --> 02:38:25.553
MATT: There is a window there.

3953
02:38:25.553 --> 02:38:26.837
There's not one facing this way.

3954
02:38:26.837 --> 02:38:28.382
MARISHA: Did say the horse was tired.

3955
02:38:28.382 --> 02:38:29.799
TALIESIN: Yeah, and then,

3956
02:38:33.571 --> 02:38:38.571
yeah actually, yeah, yeah that's where I'm going to.

3957
02:38:39.006 --> 02:38:41.939
MATT: Okay, ending Caduceus' turn.

3958
02:38:41.939 --> 02:38:43.655
So Nott,

3959
02:38:46.268 --> 02:38:47.294
(sighs) at the top--

3960
02:38:47.294 --> 02:38:49.177
TRAVIS: (excited laughter)

3961
02:38:49.177 --> 02:38:50.583
MATT: -- turning around in the chamber,

3962
02:38:50.583 --> 02:38:52.750
the drow is looking at you

3963
02:38:55.250 --> 02:38:57.500
and it just gives you look.

3964
02:38:58.553 --> 02:39:00.053
"And why are you skulking around?

3965
02:39:00.053 --> 02:39:01.053
"Interesting."

3966
02:39:01.932 --> 02:39:04.202
SAM: Is it the drow's turn, my turn?

3967
02:39:04.202 --> 02:39:05.868
MATT: It's the drow's turn.
SAM: Okay.

3968
02:39:05.868 --> 02:39:07.650
MATT: I need you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

3969
02:39:07.650 --> 02:39:10.133
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.

3970
02:39:10.133 --> 02:39:11.831
Not great.

3971
02:39:11.831 --> 02:39:12.664
Nine.

3972
02:39:12.664 --> 02:39:13.497
MATT: Nine.

3973
02:39:16.564 --> 02:39:18.622
This drow's a pretty great fella,

3974
02:39:20.346 --> 02:39:22.704
and whatever he needs,

3975
02:39:22.704 --> 02:39:23.660
you're going to take care of.

3976
02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:26.054
This has been a misunderstanding

3977
02:39:26.054 --> 02:39:28.583
and you are at this drow's because you are charmed.

3978
02:39:28.583 --> 02:39:30.503
SAM: Cool.

3979
02:39:30.503 --> 02:39:32.903
MATT: He says, "Why don't you

3980
02:39:35.086 --> 02:39:35.919
"go ahead and watch the door

3981
02:39:35.919 --> 02:39:37.427
"and not let anything come through

3982
02:39:37.427 --> 02:39:40.723
"without using one of those little weapons at your side?"

3983
02:39:40.723 --> 02:39:42.790
SAM: Sounds good to me.

3984
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:44.275
MATT: "Great, thank you for that,"

3985
02:39:44.275 --> 02:39:47.528
and continues to walk down the stairs.

3986
02:39:47.528 --> 02:39:49.811
TRAVIS: Spell that: (drawn out) fuck.

3987
02:39:52.481 --> 02:39:55.231
MATT: Steps to the inside and heads--

3988
02:39:56.068 --> 02:40:00.777
TRAVIS: (laughs) What's happening?

3989
02:40:00.777 --> 02:40:02.194
What's happening?

3990
02:40:04.833 --> 02:40:05.666
MATT: All right.

3991
02:40:07.466 --> 02:40:09.162
The hobgoblin walks down the steps past you

3992
02:40:09.162 --> 02:40:12.384
and just pushes and walks down very calmly

3993
02:40:12.384 --> 02:40:14.107
to where the hobgoblin is,

3994
02:40:14.107 --> 02:40:19.107
gives a look and they both begin to walk towards the exit.

3995
02:40:19.594 --> 02:40:21.651
Now it comes to the hobgoblin's turn.

3996
02:40:21.651 --> 02:40:22.766
The hobgoblin's just waiting.

3997
02:40:22.766 --> 02:40:25.251
It's looking up at you, confused,

3998
02:40:25.251 --> 02:40:27.355
but heard the conversation

3999
02:40:27.355 --> 02:40:30.321
and continues to follow at the front door.

4000
02:40:30.321 --> 02:40:31.345
Correct.

4001
02:40:31.345 --> 02:40:34.694
It's following behind the drow.

4002
02:40:34.694 --> 02:40:37.417
That's the full extent of where it can travel.

4003
02:40:37.417 --> 02:40:39.110
End of their turns. Caleb, you're up.

4004
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:41.618
LIAM: Okay, I was at the window looking out.

4005
02:40:41.618 --> 02:40:44.808
I'm going to try to clumsily crawl through the window

4006
02:40:44.808 --> 02:40:46.039
and spill out here.

4007
02:40:46.039 --> 02:40:47.353
MATT: All right, make an acrobatics check.

4008
02:40:47.353 --> 02:40:48.186
LIAM: Okay.

4009
02:40:49.061 --> 02:40:50.408
SAM: To get out a window?

4010
02:40:50.408 --> 02:40:52.060
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: <i>Ja, ja, ja.</i>

4011
02:40:52.060 --> 02:40:52.968
LIAM: 12.

4012
02:40:52.968 --> 02:40:53.801
MATT: 12.

4013
02:40:53.801 --> 02:40:56.262
It's a little less cool than Beau's exit.

4014
02:40:56.262 --> 02:40:59.948
It's more of a pull something, get out.

4015
02:40:59.948 --> 02:41:01.263
It takes you 15 feet of movement

4016
02:41:01.263 --> 02:41:02.198
to get off to that corner there.

4017
02:41:02.198 --> 02:41:05.688
LIAM: I want to go five, ten, 15 so I can see--

4018
02:41:05.688 --> 02:41:06.704
MATT: That's as far as you can get.

4019
02:41:06.704 --> 02:41:07.662
LIAM: That way.

4020
02:41:07.662 --> 02:41:12.561
I crush the catmint flower in my hand

4021
02:41:12.561 --> 02:41:13.977
and stretch my hand out

4022
02:41:13.977 --> 02:41:15.716
and a small translucent cat

4023
02:41:15.716 --> 02:41:17.627
appears hovering just above the horse

4024
02:41:17.627 --> 02:41:19.572
and the dragonborn for a split second,

4025
02:41:19.572 --> 02:41:22.891
then there is a giant orange claw

4026
02:41:22.891 --> 02:41:24.354
floating just above them.

4027
02:41:24.354 --> 02:41:25.721
MATT: All righty.

4028
02:41:26.781 --> 02:41:28.484
TALIESIN: I love the all righty.

4029
02:41:28.484 --> 02:41:29.576
Yeah, of course there is.

4030
02:41:29.576 --> 02:41:30.826
MATT: There you go.

4031
02:41:32.409 --> 02:41:33.331
LAURA: Big ass claw.

4032
02:41:33.331 --> 02:41:36.659
LIAM: Actually I would like it to be a little past them

4033
02:41:36.659 --> 02:41:38.587
because what it's going to do is--

4034
02:41:38.587 --> 02:41:39.420
MATT: This way?
LIAM: Yeah.

4035
02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:42.246
It's going to claw the shit out of the horse.

4036
02:41:42.246 --> 02:41:45.083
MATT: Okay, so you want it to move down to like--

4037
02:41:45.083 --> 02:41:46.131
LIAM: Attack the horse, yeah.

4038
02:41:46.131 --> 02:41:46.964
MATT: All righty.

4039
02:41:46.964 --> 02:41:47.797
LIAM: Five feet higher than that,

4040
02:41:47.797 --> 02:41:48.630
but we can just imagine it.

4041
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:52.113
MATT: Sure, five feet higher.

4042
02:41:56.491 --> 02:41:58.081
LIAM: Very low roll.

4043
02:41:58.081 --> 02:42:01.289
That is a spell attack, 14.

4044
02:42:01.289 --> 02:42:03.244
MATT: 14 definitely hits.

4045
02:42:03.244 --> 02:42:05.411
Go ahead and roll damage.

4046
02:42:06.478 --> 02:42:08.251
SAM: Liam O'Brien, candidate for president:

4047
02:42:08.251 --> 02:42:10.954
hates animals.
LIAM: Hates animals.

4048
02:42:10.954 --> 02:42:13.262
Stop that dragonborn.

4049
02:42:14.296 --> 02:42:18.421
That is, where is it?

4050
02:42:18.421 --> 02:42:21.342
Sorry, everybody. New spells, that's 4d8.

4051
02:42:21.342 --> 02:42:22.576
4d8, here we go.

4052
02:42:25.159 --> 02:42:26.190
20.

4053
02:42:26.190 --> 02:42:28.098
MATT: 20.

4054
02:42:28.098 --> 02:42:30.348
How do you want to do this?

4055
02:42:33.188 --> 02:42:35.304
LIAM: Grate down and grab him

4056
02:42:35.304 --> 02:42:38.205
and it will (grasping) into the horse's body

4057
02:42:38.205 --> 02:42:42.403
and smash it into that garbage pile right there.

4058
02:42:42.403 --> 02:42:44.568
MATT: You hear this (yelping)

4059
02:42:44.568 --> 02:42:46.342
as it just crushes and claws into it.

4060
02:42:46.342 --> 02:42:47.301
The horse goes limp

4061
02:42:47.301 --> 02:42:50.410
and then it's thrown into the corner there.

4062
02:42:50.410 --> 02:42:51.243
ASHLEY: Oh no!

4063
02:42:52.811 --> 02:42:53.719
TALIESIN: I feel bad about--

4064
02:42:53.719 --> 02:42:55.508
MATT: The dragonborn is thrown off its back

4065
02:42:55.508 --> 02:42:58.736
and lands prone on the ground next to it.

4066
02:42:58.736 --> 02:43:02.001
The dragonborn's wide-eyed,

4067
02:43:02.001 --> 02:43:04.112
was already out of breath it seems

4068
02:43:04.112 --> 02:43:06.894
and now is just trying to take in the circumstances.

4069
02:43:06.894 --> 02:43:09.589
Glances over and sees all of you emerging

4070
02:43:09.589 --> 02:43:10.990
and swarming into the area

4071
02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:13.121
and it's looking around very frantic and frightened.

4072
02:43:13.121 --> 02:43:15.033
LIAM: One last centimeter of Caleb's humanity

4073
02:43:15.033 --> 02:43:16.842
just withers away.

4074
02:43:16.842 --> 02:43:17.675
MATT: Okay.

4075
02:43:17.675 --> 02:43:19.147
That finishes your go, Caleb.

4076
02:43:19.147 --> 02:43:22.230
Nott, you're up.
LIAM: Terrible, terrible.

4077
02:43:23.161 --> 02:43:24.352
SAM: What, me?
MATT: Yeah, you're up.

4078
02:43:24.352 --> 02:43:25.552
SAM: Oh, I have nothing to do.

4079
02:43:25.552 --> 02:43:27.387
MATT: Yeah, you're just going to go and guard that door.

4080
02:43:27.387 --> 02:43:29.205
LIAM: Immigrants. We get the job done.
LAURA: The front door?

4081
02:43:29.205 --> 02:43:30.156
Or what door?

4082
02:43:30.156 --> 02:43:31.396
TALIESIN: The downstairs door.

4083
02:43:31.396 --> 02:43:32.545
MATT: Head on down.

4084
02:43:32.545 --> 02:43:34.506
LAURA: Oh, the front door
TALIESIN: Oh, the front door?

4085
02:43:34.506 --> 02:43:36.158
MATT: Now these are out of play, technically,

4086
02:43:36.158 --> 02:43:38.194
since we're down in this space.

4087
02:43:38.194 --> 02:43:39.338
You have come over to the side

4088
02:43:39.338 --> 02:43:43.536
and you are now guarding the entrance for your new friend.

4089
02:43:43.536 --> 02:43:45.037
SAM: Cool, cool.

4090
02:43:45.037 --> 02:43:46.511
TALIESIN: You don't get a save against charm,

4091
02:43:46.511 --> 02:43:47.828
do you?
SAM: I don't think so.

4092
02:43:47.828 --> 02:43:49.851
TALIESIN: Okay.
MATT: All right.

4093
02:43:51.326 --> 02:43:53.604
That brings us to Yasha.

4094
02:43:53.604 --> 02:43:54.846
MARISHA: I was trying to startle it.

4095
02:43:54.846 --> 02:43:57.393
MATT: You did hear the horse scream

4096
02:43:57.393 --> 02:44:01.541
and you've heard already the sound of heavy impact combat

4097
02:44:01.541 --> 02:44:02.651
on the opposite side of the house.

4098
02:44:02.651 --> 02:44:05.609
ASHLEY: Okay, do I see Caduceus or Jester running

4099
02:44:05.609 --> 02:44:06.767
or any of us?

4100
02:44:06.767 --> 02:44:08.146
MATT: Glancing from where you are,

4101
02:44:08.146 --> 02:44:10.757
you can just barely see them dart and pass, so yes.

4102
02:44:10.757 --> 02:44:13.471
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to start making my way out there

4103
02:44:13.471 --> 02:44:15.851
just towards my friends.

4104
02:44:15.851 --> 02:44:18.795
MATT: 15, go ahead and make an acrobatics check for me

4105
02:44:18.795 --> 02:44:22.179
to see if it reduces your speed.

4106
02:44:22.179 --> 02:44:23.318
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

4107
02:44:23.318 --> 02:44:26.117
MATT: Oh, you run and it's like,

4108
02:44:26.117 --> 02:44:29.305
you hear a faint (suction) from the air suction

4109
02:44:29.305 --> 02:44:31.638
of quickly you move through.

4110
02:44:32.566 --> 02:44:33.983
TALIESIN: Dramatic alley.

4111
02:44:34.979 --> 02:44:36.816
MATT: 40, is that your movement, right?

4112
02:44:36.816 --> 02:44:37.649
ASHLEY: Yep.

4113
02:44:37.649 --> 02:44:38.525
MATT: All right, so that's your movement.

4114
02:44:38.525 --> 02:44:42.066
You can continue to move forward if you want.

4115
02:44:42.066 --> 02:44:46.316
ASHLEY: Did I see him cast a spell or anything like that?

4116
02:44:48.454 --> 02:44:49.287
What did I see?

4117
02:44:49.287 --> 02:44:50.468
Did I see that we're in battle?

4118
02:44:50.468 --> 02:44:52.741
MATT: You see both of them rushing out

4119
02:44:52.741 --> 02:44:54.312
and looking intense.

4120
02:44:54.312 --> 02:44:55.882
You see Caleb in the background

4121
02:44:55.882 --> 02:44:57.362
who has just been doing this.

4122
02:44:57.362 --> 02:44:58.476
ASHLEY: All right, I would like to rage.

4123
02:44:58.476 --> 02:45:00.182
MATT: Okay, bonus action, you are raging

4124
02:45:00.182 --> 02:45:01.881
and you have your action still.

4125
02:45:01.881 --> 02:45:03.470
ASHLEY: Okay.

4126
02:45:03.470 --> 02:45:05.416
I still don't see anything from there?

4127
02:45:05.416 --> 02:45:06.257
MATT: Nope.

4128
02:45:06.257 --> 02:45:07.777
You see, everyone's going towards the front of the building.

4129
02:45:07.777 --> 02:45:08.869
You see everyone's attention this way.

4130
02:45:08.869 --> 02:45:10.986
ASHLEY: I'll just take the rest of my movement.

4131
02:45:10.986 --> 02:45:15.029
MATT: Okay, five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

4132
02:45:15.029 --> 02:45:15.862
Are you going through the building

4133
02:45:15.862 --> 02:45:17.612
or you staying there?

4134
02:45:18.695 --> 02:45:21.386
ASHLEY: No, I'm staying because I don't know,

4135
02:45:21.386 --> 02:45:25.014
I see that the fight is here, so I'll stay there.

4136
02:45:25.014 --> 02:45:26.750
MATT: So you're just holding the doors and guarding?

4137
02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:27.633
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

4138
02:45:27.633 --> 02:45:28.924
That finishes your turn.

4139
02:45:28.924 --> 02:45:31.909
Now it's the dragonborn's turn.

4140
02:45:31.909 --> 02:45:34.297
The dragonborn's going to get up for half its movement,

4141
02:45:34.297 --> 02:45:35.237
15 more feet.

4142
02:45:35.237 --> 02:45:40.179
It's going to go run this way, ten, 15

4143
02:45:41.074 --> 02:45:41.959
and then it's going to dash,

4144
02:45:41.959 --> 02:45:45.290
and just continue to run another 30 feet this way.

4145
02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:46.297
It's about there.

4146
02:45:46.297 --> 02:45:51.006
It's off the map, but it's maybe 20 feet off the map.

4147
02:45:51.006 --> 02:45:52.099
MARISHA: The dragonborn?
MATT: Dragonborn.

4148
02:45:52.099 --> 02:45:53.807
It's just like (panting).

4149
02:45:53.807 --> 02:45:55.528
She's running as hard as she can

4150
02:45:55.528 --> 02:45:57.731
because her horse just got killed

4151
02:45:57.731 --> 02:46:01.313
by a giant floating ethereal arcane cat claw.

4152
02:46:01.313 --> 02:46:05.309
That'll make you run and maybe piss yourself a little.

4153
02:46:05.309 --> 02:46:06.845
That finishes the dragonborn's turn.

4154
02:46:06.845 --> 02:46:08.944
Jester, you're up.

4155
02:46:08.944 --> 02:46:09.777
LAURA: Okay.

4156
02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:16.942
I'm supposed to get the dragonborn, right?

4157
02:46:16.942 --> 02:46:18.209
MATT: Yeah.

4158
02:46:18.209 --> 02:46:19.133
LAURA: Fucking hell.

4159
02:46:19.133 --> 02:46:20.644
I'm going to Dimension--

4160
02:46:20.644 --> 02:46:22.168
MATT: Well, whatever you think is important.

4161
02:46:22.168 --> 02:46:24.085
Do what you want to do.

4162
02:46:26.707 --> 02:46:29.087
LAURA: I'm going to run forward.

4163
02:46:29.087 --> 02:46:30.635
MATT: Okay.

4164
02:46:30.635 --> 02:46:32.802
Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

4165
02:46:34.481 --> 02:46:35.656
LAURA: And,

4166
02:46:36.881 --> 02:46:41.337
do you think they're within 120 feet, the dragonborn?

4167
02:46:41.337 --> 02:46:42.845
MATT: It's a good chance.

4168
02:46:42.845 --> 02:46:45.805
LAURA: I'm going to try to Guiding Bolt them.

4169
02:46:45.805 --> 02:46:46.771
MATT: The dragonborn?
LAURA: Yeah.

4170
02:46:46.771 --> 02:46:50.138
MATT: Okay, go for it go for attack.

4171
02:46:53.451 --> 02:46:54.694
ASHLEY: No, that was cocked.

4172
02:46:54.694 --> 02:46:55.951
MATT: No, that wasn't.

4173
02:46:55.951 --> 02:46:57.826
What'd you roll? Is that a natural one?

4174
02:46:57.826 --> 02:46:58.923
LAURA: Yes, it was.

4175
02:46:58.923 --> 02:47:01.630
MATT: I'm sorry.
LAURA: Yes it was, Matthew.

4176
02:47:01.630 --> 02:47:04.398
MATT: I didn't know if it was a seven.

4177
02:47:04.398 --> 02:47:05.441
I feel like such an asshole.

4178
02:47:05.441 --> 02:47:06.274
I didn't mean to--

4179
02:47:06.274 --> 02:47:10.537
LAURA: No, maybe it was a seven and I just misread it.

4180
02:47:10.537 --> 02:47:14.005
MATT: In running and pulling up your holy symbol

4181
02:47:14.005 --> 02:47:16.798
and preparing the spell,

4182
02:47:16.798 --> 02:47:20.290
at this moment you see the horse get crushed and thrown.

4183
02:47:20.290 --> 02:47:21.798
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no!

4184
02:47:21.798 --> 02:47:23.247
MATT: And it throws you off.

4185
02:47:23.247 --> 02:47:25.728
As you release the energy, you're looking one direction

4186
02:47:25.728 --> 02:47:28.138
while the divine power of the Traveler

4187
02:47:28.138 --> 02:47:32.132
thrusts in a different and unfortunately just goes wide

4188
02:47:32.132 --> 02:47:36.030
and sparkles in this flash of divine energy in the sky

4189
02:47:36.030 --> 02:47:39.004
harmlessly above the dragonborn.

4190
02:47:39.004 --> 02:47:41.563
You've got a bonus action, though.

4191
02:47:41.563 --> 02:47:42.582
LAURA: (blows raspberry)

4192
02:47:42.582 --> 02:47:44.593
MATT: Use your bonus action and blow raspberry, okay.

4193
02:47:44.593 --> 02:47:47.799
LAURA: I'm going to use my bonus action

4194
02:47:47.799 --> 02:47:50.065
to yep, blow a raspberry.

4195
02:47:50.065 --> 02:47:50.898
MATT: All right, blow a raspberry.

4196
02:47:50.898 --> 02:47:52.925
Got it, Jester. Fjord, you're up.

4197
02:47:52.925 --> 02:47:55.670
TRAVIS: I see Yasha--
MATT: You see Yasha dart around that way

4198
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:57.948
TRAVIS: I will take the other direction.

4199
02:47:57.948 --> 02:47:58.781
MATT: Okay.

4200
02:48:00.706 --> 02:48:03.953
15, 20, 25, 30.

4201
02:48:03.953 --> 02:48:05.787
You just make it around the side there with your movement.

4202
02:48:05.787 --> 02:48:09.368
TRAVIS: Can I see <i>la</i> dragonborn?

4203
02:48:09.368 --> 02:48:10.497
MATT: You can, yes.

4204
02:48:10.497 --> 02:48:13.989
They're about somewhere between 30 to 40 feet from you

4205
02:48:13.989 --> 02:48:15.865
at a quick glance.

4206
02:48:15.865 --> 02:48:17.032
TRAVIS: I will send,

4207
02:48:20.422 --> 02:48:24.802
I will fire two bolts of Eldritch Blast at it.

4208
02:48:24.802 --> 02:48:26.559
MATT: Go for it. Roll for two attacks.

4209
02:48:26.559 --> 02:48:27.392
TRAVIS: Okay.

4210
02:48:30.074 --> 02:48:33.824
MATT: Laura, we got to get some sage and--

4211
02:48:34.922 --> 02:48:36.987
TRAVIS: 14
MATT: -- get this curse out of there.

4212
02:48:36.987 --> 02:48:39.627
14 hits.
TRAVIS: 14 hits?

4213
02:48:39.627 --> 02:48:40.460
MATT: Yes.

4214
02:48:41.775 --> 02:48:42.823
TRAVIS: 17.

4215
02:48:42.823 --> 02:48:44.403
MATT: Both hit, roll damage on each.

4216
02:48:44.403 --> 02:48:47.089
TRAVIS: 14 hits, yeah the dragonborn, right?

4217
02:48:47.089 --> 02:48:47.922
LAURA: It was the same dice.

4218
02:48:47.922 --> 02:48:50.098
I didn't put it into jail.

4219
02:48:50.098 --> 02:48:51.406
SAM: That's the problem.
LIAM: That's on you, then.

4220
02:48:51.406 --> 02:48:52.433
LAURA: That's on me.

4221
02:48:52.433 --> 02:48:54.108
LIAM: If we all die, that's on you.

4222
02:48:54.108 --> 02:48:57.580
I think our mistakes tonight have been equal.

4223
02:48:57.580 --> 02:49:00.788
TRAVIS: It's only six points on the first one.

4224
02:49:00.788 --> 02:49:02.713
That's cocked.

4225
02:49:03.818 --> 02:49:05.011
14 on the second.

4226
02:49:05.011 --> 02:49:08.532
So 20 total points of Eldritch Blast damage.

4227
02:49:08.532 --> 02:49:09.865
MATT: Okay, so Fjord turns the corner,

4228
02:49:09.865 --> 02:49:12.589
looks over and sees dragonborn running,

4229
02:49:12.589 --> 02:49:14.600
and releases two Eldritch Blasts.

4230
02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:17.944
You watch the dragonborn run, run,

4231
02:49:17.944 --> 02:49:21.840
hole through the chest, falls.

4232
02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:23.030
TRAVIS: 20 points of damage?

4233
02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:25.325
MATT: Yep, falls dead.

4234
02:49:25.325 --> 02:49:28.362
MARISHA: They were definitely a messenger.

4235
02:49:28.362 --> 02:49:30.074
MATT: They were a scout

4236
02:49:30.074 --> 02:49:34.473
and they are big old Eldritch hole in their sternum

4237
02:49:34.473 --> 02:49:37.581
from behind falls dead onto the street.

4238
02:49:37.581 --> 02:49:38.854
TRAVIS: <i>Adios muchacho</i>.

4239
02:49:38.854 --> 02:49:41.104
(laughter)

4240
02:49:42.588 --> 02:49:43.941
MATT: Okay.

4241
02:49:43.941 --> 02:49:45.458
TALIESIN: Yep. Nope.

4242
02:49:45.458 --> 02:49:47.224
SAM: (intones flute from "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly")

4243
02:49:47.224 --> 02:49:48.197
TRAVIS: Did we win?

4244
02:49:48.197 --> 02:49:50.114
MATT: Beau, it's your turn.
LIAM: Shit!

4245
02:49:51.861 --> 02:49:53.898
If I could just kill myself just touching it.

4246
02:49:53.898 --> 02:49:54.731
MARISHA: It's my turn.

4247
02:49:54.731 --> 02:49:55.731
MATT: Yes, it is.

4248
02:49:58.064 --> 02:49:59.481
LIAM: That was quick.

4249
02:50:02.397 --> 02:50:04.614
MARISHA: Yasha, are you going towards the door?

4250
02:50:04.614 --> 02:50:05.474
Is that what you were doing?

4251
02:50:05.474 --> 02:50:08.665
ASHLEY: No, I was, I don't know what,

4252
02:50:08.665 --> 02:50:09.739
I just saw you guys fighting.

4253
02:50:09.739 --> 02:50:10.665
I came out there

4254
02:50:10.665 --> 02:50:11.839
and then I saw everything,

4255
02:50:11.839 --> 02:50:12.996
I saw the dragonborn running.

4256
02:50:12.996 --> 02:50:15.113
I'm not going inside because I feel like

4257
02:50:15.113 --> 02:50:16.848
Nott is probably doing a good job in there.

4258
02:50:16.848 --> 02:50:19.012
I have no idea what's going on,

4259
02:50:19.012 --> 02:50:20.717
but I'm guarding the door.

4260
02:50:20.717 --> 02:50:22.338
I'm holding the door.

4261
02:50:22.338 --> 02:50:23.671
TRAVIS: Hold the door.

4262
02:50:24.645 --> 02:50:27.533
ASHLEY: I'm waiting. If anything comes out, I'll be ready.

4263
02:50:27.533 --> 02:50:30.923
LAURA: (Hodor impression) Hold the door!

4264
02:50:30.923 --> 02:50:32.289
MATT: What are you doing, Beau?

4265
02:50:32.289 --> 02:50:33.780
TALIESIN: Hodor jokes were fun once.

4266
02:50:33.780 --> 02:50:37.606
MARISHA: I'm going to head up by Yasha.

4267
02:50:39.134 --> 02:50:42.147
LIAM: I know, it's not the same now.

4268
02:50:42.147 --> 02:50:43.172
There's a taint.

4269
02:50:43.172 --> 02:50:45.213
MARISHA: Over the wall, over the wall.

4270
02:50:45.213 --> 02:50:46.046
MATT: This way?

4271
02:50:46.046 --> 02:50:46.884
MARISHA: Over the wall!

4272
02:50:46.884 --> 02:50:48.245
MATT: Acrobatics check for me.

4273
02:50:48.245 --> 02:50:50.620
LAURA: I'm going to get a tattoo.

4274
02:50:52.004 --> 02:50:54.328
MARISHA: Athletics, acrobatics, 19.

4275
02:50:54.328 --> 02:50:56.695
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

4276
02:50:56.695 --> 02:50:58.744
So you're right next to Yasha.

4277
02:50:58.744 --> 02:50:59.741
That's your movement.

4278
02:50:59.741 --> 02:51:00.574
MARISHA: That was 45?

4279
02:51:00.574 --> 02:51:01.407
MATT: Yeah,

4280
02:51:01.407 --> 02:51:03.657
or it's 40 to get up there.

4281
02:51:05.480 --> 02:51:07.859
MARISHA: Where's the-- fuck!

4282
02:51:07.859 --> 02:51:09.251
ASHLEY: What happened? We were standing back there

4283
02:51:09.251 --> 02:51:11.974
and then we saw that there was a--

4284
02:51:11.974 --> 02:51:13.448
MARISHA: I'm going to open the door.

4285
02:51:13.448 --> 02:51:14.288
MATT: Okay.

4286
02:51:14.288 --> 02:51:15.329
SAM: Oh boy, it's on.

4287
02:51:15.329 --> 02:51:16.162
MATT: Open the door

4288
02:51:16.162 --> 02:51:18.590
and you see on the interior, Nott,

4289
02:51:18.590 --> 02:51:22.145
who's been holding a ready crossbow shot.

4290
02:51:22.145 --> 02:51:23.285
Go ahead and fire at Yasha.

4291
02:51:23.285 --> 02:51:25.288
MARISHA: Oh!

4292
02:51:25.288 --> 02:51:26.471
TRAVIS: She's raging.

4293
02:51:26.471 --> 02:51:27.597
MATT: She is raging.

4294
02:51:27.597 --> 02:51:29.519
SAM: Oh, at Yasha?

4295
02:51:29.519 --> 02:51:30.678
I mean, it definitely hits.

4296
02:51:30.678 --> 02:51:34.077
It's like 28.
TRAVIS: I don't know. With your bracers

4297
02:51:34.077 --> 02:51:35.156
that are on order.

4298
02:51:35.156 --> 02:51:36.200
MARISHA: Can I Deflect Missiles

4299
02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:37.951
and try and catch the arrow for Yasha

4300
02:51:37.951 --> 02:51:40.284
since I'm right next to her?

4301
02:51:43.685 --> 02:51:47.185
MATT: Roll a dexterity check off against Nott.

4302
02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:52.602
Both of you guys roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

4303
02:51:53.702 --> 02:51:55.191
MARISHA: Oof.

4304
02:51:55.191 --> 02:51:56.156
SAM: 24.

4305
02:51:56.156 --> 02:51:59.149
MARISHA: Ooh, definitely not, 13.

4306
02:51:59.149 --> 02:52:02.455
MATT: No, unfortunately, the unexpected firing

4307
02:52:02.455 --> 02:52:03.547
of this crossbow bolt

4308
02:52:03.547 --> 02:52:04.605
catches you off-guard

4309
02:52:04.605 --> 02:52:06.738
and you try and reach just a second too soon

4310
02:52:06.738 --> 02:52:08.078
as it slips through your grasp.

4311
02:52:08.078 --> 02:52:10.375
You can roll sneak attack damage as well

4312
02:52:10.375 --> 02:52:13.285
because Yasha was unaware that you would be shooting her

4313
02:52:13.285 --> 02:52:15.860
as soon as the door opened.

4314
02:52:15.860 --> 02:52:17.154
LIAM: Wait a second, wait a second.

4315
02:52:17.154 --> 02:52:18.030
LAURA: Sneak attack?!

4316
02:52:18.030 --> 02:52:21.419
LIAM: I thought that hiding was like, it's a condition,

4317
02:52:21.419 --> 02:52:23.254
like if that shit's on

4318
02:52:23.254 --> 02:52:24.428
and there's an attack going on,

4319
02:52:24.428 --> 02:52:27.007
I just remember the the shitty end of this as Vax,

4320
02:52:27.007 --> 02:52:29.272
like if your enemy knows that shit is happening.

4321
02:52:29.272 --> 02:52:30.347
MATT: This isn't about being hidden,

4322
02:52:30.347 --> 02:52:32.563
this about being shot by your friend when the door opens.

4323
02:52:32.563 --> 02:52:33.396
LIAM: All right.

4324
02:52:33.396 --> 02:52:35.374
(laughter)

4325
02:52:35.374 --> 02:52:37.453
MATT: There are few things as surprising in combat

4326
02:52:37.453 --> 02:52:40.177
than having one of your allies go (arrow shot).

4327
02:52:40.177 --> 02:52:42.301
TALIESIN: I mean to be fair.
LIAM: It's cinematic as hell.

4328
02:52:42.301 --> 02:52:46.059
TALIESIN: That's surprising out of combat, to be fair, too.

4329
02:52:46.059 --> 02:52:47.724
SAM: 25 points of damage.

4330
02:52:47.724 --> 02:52:52.486
MATT: 25 points of damage reduced to 12.

4331
02:52:52.486 --> 02:52:54.876
LAURA: That was a good hit, good hit.

4332
02:52:54.876 --> 02:52:56.264
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

4333
02:52:56.264 --> 02:52:57.880
MATT: The door is now open.

4334
02:52:58.944 --> 02:53:00.171
All right, Beau.

4335
02:53:00.171 --> 02:53:02.359
LIAM: Fuck, this is such a clusterfuck.

4336
02:53:02.359 --> 02:53:04.004
MATT: You pull the door open.

4337
02:53:04.004 --> 02:53:07.148
You see a bolt go right into Yasha's shoulder,

4338
02:53:07.148 --> 02:53:08.292
looking forward.

4339
02:53:08.292 --> 02:53:09.125
MARISHA: Nott!

4340
02:53:10.241 --> 02:53:11.251
That's nothing.

4341
02:53:11.251 --> 02:53:12.194
This is my turn, right?

4342
02:53:12.194 --> 02:53:13.715
MATT: Sure, you have a bonus action.

4343
02:53:13.715 --> 02:53:15.215
MARISHA: Oh, bonus action.

4344
02:53:16.866 --> 02:53:20.460
I guess I can attack with my bonus action, right?

4345
02:53:20.460 --> 02:53:22.377
MATT: You have nothing you're in melee with.

4346
02:53:22.377 --> 02:53:23.268
You can throw something.

4347
02:53:23.268 --> 02:53:24.709
Right now the door's in your way.

4348
02:53:24.709 --> 02:53:26.032
You can, but they'll have partial coverage.

4349
02:53:26.032 --> 02:53:28.822
You'll have to throw around the door.

4350
02:53:28.822 --> 02:53:31.778
MARISHA: To attack Nott?

4351
02:53:31.778 --> 02:53:32.645
MATT: Hmm?

4352
02:53:32.645 --> 02:53:34.478
MARISHA: To attack Nott?

4353
02:53:34.478 --> 02:53:35.987
MATT: You can attack Nott or anybody else in the room.

4354
02:53:35.987 --> 02:53:37.277
MARISHA: I'm going to just get through the threshold.

4355
02:53:37.277 --> 02:53:38.110
MATT: Okay.

4356
02:53:38.110 --> 02:53:39.161
MARISHA: I'm going to use my movement

4357
02:53:39.161 --> 02:53:41.196
to get in there

4358
02:53:41.196 --> 02:53:43.132
and step out of the way

4359
02:53:43.132 --> 02:53:45.163
to not block the door for Yasha,

4360
02:53:45.163 --> 02:53:46.123
but be by the door.

4361
02:53:46.123 --> 02:53:47.556
MATT: Okay, that finishes your turn?
MARISHA: Yeah.

4362
02:53:47.556 --> 02:53:49.298
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

4363
02:53:49.298 --> 02:53:51.294
TALIESIN: Okay I can,

4364
02:53:51.294 --> 02:53:52.149
I believe I can cast spells

4365
02:53:52.149 --> 02:53:54.899
when I'm using Hidden Step, right?

4366
02:53:55.814 --> 02:53:57.877
Hidden Step, as bonus action, turn invisible

4367
02:53:57.877 --> 02:53:58.710
until the start of your next turn.

4368
02:53:58.710 --> 02:54:01.706
You attack, deal damage, or force a saving throw

4369
02:54:01.706 --> 02:54:02.931
once per short rest.

4370
02:54:02.931 --> 02:54:04.319
MATT: Yeah, you can you can cast while you're doing it.

4371
02:54:04.319 --> 02:54:06.294
It's one of the few cases invisibility.

4372
02:54:06.294 --> 02:54:10.762
TALIESIN: That window is right there, if I recall?

4373
02:54:10.762 --> 02:54:12.595
That window is a window?

4374
02:54:12.595 --> 02:54:14.422
MATT: What, right here? Yes, there is.

4375
02:54:14.422 --> 02:54:15.255
TALIESIN: And it's open?

4376
02:54:15.255 --> 02:54:18.271
MATT: It does not open. It is glass.

4377
02:54:18.271 --> 02:54:19.604
TALIESIN: It's glass?
MATT: Yes.

4378
02:54:19.604 --> 02:54:21.180
TALIESIN: Can I cast through glass?

4379
02:54:21.180 --> 02:54:22.421
MATT: If you can see something through it.

4380
02:54:22.421 --> 02:54:23.504
It depends.

4381
02:54:23.504 --> 02:54:24.337
If it's an effect that happens

4382
02:54:24.337 --> 02:54:25.813
and you can see the spot, yes.

4383
02:54:25.813 --> 02:54:27.007
If it something that has to travel,

4384
02:54:27.007 --> 02:54:28.415
it has to break the glass to get through it.

4385
02:54:28.415 --> 02:54:29.429
TALIESIN: Cool, all right.

4386
02:54:29.429 --> 02:54:30.461
I'm going to turn invisible.

4387
02:54:30.461 --> 02:54:32.339
I'm going to walk up to the glass.

4388
02:54:32.339 --> 02:54:37.339
That's five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

4389
02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:39.328
MATT: You're right up to the window there.

4390
02:54:39.328 --> 02:54:41.706
TALIESIN: How many enemies do I see in there?

4391
02:54:41.706 --> 02:54:43.967
MATT: You see Beau, you see Nott,

4392
02:54:43.967 --> 02:54:47.775
you see the the cloaked drow figure that entered,

4393
02:54:47.775 --> 02:54:49.235
the hobgoblin.

4394
02:54:49.235 --> 02:54:51.925
You see Maruo, the goblin that owns the establishment.

4395
02:54:51.925 --> 02:54:52.758
Those are--

4396
02:54:52.758 --> 02:54:53.591
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bane

4397
02:54:53.591 --> 02:54:55.535
on the three that I know are a problem.

4398
02:54:55.535 --> 02:54:57.368
TRAVIS: Oh, I love it.
MATT: Okay.

4399
02:54:58.491 --> 02:55:00.783
LIAM: That's why I sped up your fucking initiative

4400
02:55:00.783 --> 02:55:02.773
because I wanted to Bane.

4401
02:55:02.773 --> 02:55:04.414
(laughter)

4402
02:55:05.481 --> 02:55:06.481
MATT: On--

4403
02:55:07.439 --> 02:55:08.272
TALIESIN: All three of them.

4404
02:55:08.272 --> 02:55:09.338
MATT: All three, including Maruo?

4405
02:55:09.338 --> 02:55:12.446
LIAM: (like Bane) Oh, including Maruo.

4406
02:55:12.446 --> 02:55:16.218
MATT: All right, Maruo has now ducked below the counter.

4407
02:55:16.218 --> 02:55:18.757
TALIESIN: Did Maruo duck below the counter?

4408
02:55:18.757 --> 02:55:21.530
MATT: Maruo, as all this has just happened

4409
02:55:21.530 --> 02:55:22.618
and then you cast it,

4410
02:55:22.618 --> 02:55:23.566
feels the effect hit

4411
02:55:23.566 --> 02:55:24.867
and then ducks below the counter.

4412
02:55:24.867 --> 02:55:26.353
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair.

4413
02:55:26.353 --> 02:55:27.311
MATT: All right.

4414
02:55:27.311 --> 02:55:28.655
That finishes your turn.

4415
02:55:28.655 --> 02:55:30.584
TALIESIN: They get to make charisma saving throws.

4416
02:55:30.584 --> 02:55:31.417
MATT: They do.

4417
02:55:32.292 --> 02:55:34.084
So Maruo, fails.

4418
02:55:37.691 --> 02:55:38.874
The hobgoblin fails.

4419
02:55:38.874 --> 02:55:39.845
TRAVIS: Ooh, come on now.

4420
02:55:39.845 --> 02:55:43.487
MATT: The drow fails. Yeah, all three have Bane.

4421
02:55:43.487 --> 02:55:47.791
LIAM: (as Bane) Oh, your punishment will be more severe.

4422
02:55:47.791 --> 02:55:49.550
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's my whole kit and caboodle.

4423
02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:52.030
I'm invisible till the start of my next turn.

4424
02:55:52.030 --> 02:55:56.672
SAM: Why does everything Bane say start with "Oh"?

4425
02:55:56.672 --> 02:56:00.030
TALIESIN: You need a can of Pringles to do it the right way.

4426
02:56:01.281 --> 02:56:03.279
MATT: The drow steps over,

4427
02:56:03.279 --> 02:56:05.017
is walking forward

4428
02:56:05.017 --> 02:56:08.090
with the hobgoblin behind them as all this happens.

4429
02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:09.573
Sees Caduceus in the window,

4430
02:56:09.573 --> 02:56:12.755
looks over as, oh no, you're invisible,

4431
02:56:12.755 --> 02:56:14.234
sees you walk in

4432
02:56:14.234 --> 02:56:16.549
and just gives an amused glance,

4433
02:56:16.549 --> 02:56:18.915
looks past and looks at Yasha and goes,

4434
02:56:20.432 --> 02:56:22.024
"Orphan Maker?"

4435
02:56:22.024 --> 02:56:23.882
(gasping and yelling)

4436
02:56:23.882 --> 02:56:27.007
SAM: Oh, backstory, lore it up, backstory, lore it up.

4437
02:56:27.007 --> 02:56:28.247
MARISHA: This is the drow?

4438
02:56:28.247 --> 02:56:29.834
TRAVIS: (alarm sirens)
MATT: This is the drow.

4439
02:56:29.834 --> 02:56:32.904
ASHLEY: (stuttering) Who-- I-- wha--

4440
02:56:32.904 --> 02:56:34.246
MATT: You do not recognize this person.

4441
02:56:34.246 --> 02:56:35.440
ASHLEY: Who just said that?

4442
02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:40.011
Because I just got real, everything went real (vibrations).

4443
02:56:40.011 --> 02:56:40.928
MATT: The drow.

4444
02:56:42.969 --> 02:56:47.153
Turns to you, Nott and says,

4445
02:56:48.135 --> 02:56:52.030
"Just take care of her for me,"

4446
02:56:52.030 --> 02:56:55.863
winks at you and reaches back and grabs

4447
02:56:55.863 --> 02:56:57.746
the hobgoblin.

4448
02:56:57.746 --> 02:56:59.840
SAM: Oh no.
LAURA and ASHLEY: No, no, no.

4449
02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:00.923
MATT: You watch them both.

4450
02:57:00.923 --> 02:57:02.999
LAURA: Use a spell, use a spell, use a spell.

4451
02:57:02.999 --> 02:57:04.232
MATT: You can't use it as a reaction.

4452
02:57:04.232 --> 02:57:05.253
TALIESIN: I can, though.

4453
02:57:05.253 --> 02:57:06.086
MATT: What?

4454
02:57:06.086 --> 02:57:07.875
TALIESIN: Dispel Magic as a reaction.
MATT: Dispel Magic is an action

4455
02:57:07.875 --> 02:57:08.708
not a reaction.

4456
02:57:08.708 --> 02:57:09.621
TALIESIN: No, there's no reaction?

4457
02:57:09.621 --> 02:57:10.454
MATT: Counterspell is what you need

4458
02:57:10.454 --> 02:57:11.973
and he's too far away, unfortunately.

4459
02:57:11.973 --> 02:57:15.256
TRAVIS: Can I see them through a window?

4460
02:57:15.256 --> 02:57:16.780
MATT: From where they are, you can see them through a window

4461
02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:17.613
and you watch them just--

4462
02:57:17.613 --> 02:57:19.571
TRAVIS: I will cast Counterspell.

4463
02:57:19.571 --> 02:57:20.834
MATT: Do you have Counterspell?

4464
02:57:20.834 --> 02:57:21.667
TRAVIS: I do.

4465
02:57:21.667 --> 02:57:23.750
LAURA: Oh shit, motherfucker!

4466
02:57:25.152 --> 02:57:27.503
MATT: Roll a perception check.
LAURA: Well, hell!

4467
02:57:27.503 --> 02:57:28.923
TRAVIS: I don't know if I can see them.

4468
02:57:28.923 --> 02:57:33.034
MATT: Roll a perception check, this is pretty--

4469
02:57:33.034 --> 02:57:34.391
LAURA and ASHLEY: Come on.

4470
02:57:34.391 --> 02:57:35.224
TRAVIS: 16.

4471
02:57:35.224 --> 02:57:36.102
MATT: 16.

4472
02:57:36.102 --> 02:57:36.989
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

4473
02:57:36.989 --> 02:57:38.958
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a--

4474
02:57:38.958 --> 02:57:41.017
TRAVIS: They're valuable spells.
MATT: I know.

4475
02:57:41.017 --> 02:57:43.207
Go ahead and roll and add your,

4476
02:57:43.207 --> 02:57:45.352
well, let me check on the--

4477
02:57:45.352 --> 02:57:47.503
(groaning)

4478
02:57:47.503 --> 02:57:48.458
TALIESIN: I'm not okay.

4479
02:57:48.458 --> 02:57:51.291
ASHLEY: We can't let them fucking leave.

4480
02:57:53.232 --> 02:57:55.080
MARISHA: Does he have you?

4481
02:57:55.080 --> 02:57:56.189
LAURA: No, he has the hobgoblin.

4482
02:57:56.189 --> 02:57:59.927
MATT: Roll and add your spell ability modifier.

4483
02:57:59.927 --> 02:58:00.760
TRAVIS: Where is that?

4484
02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:01.593
Caleb, where is that?

4485
02:58:01.593 --> 02:58:03.323
LIAM: It's right there, those three numbers at the top.

4486
02:58:03.323 --> 02:58:05.345
TRAVIS: So plus five, okay.

4487
02:58:05.345 --> 02:58:06.361
SAM: Come on, fucker.

4488
02:58:06.361 --> 02:58:07.351
TRAVIS: 20.
LIAM: Yes.

4489
02:58:07.351 --> 02:58:09.436
MATT: 20, all right.

4490
02:58:09.436 --> 02:58:11.247
TALIESIN: Do they roll against it?

4491
02:58:11.247 --> 02:58:12.545
LAURA: I don't know, I don't know.

4492
02:58:12.545 --> 02:58:15.306
SAM: Best spell in D&amp;D.
LIAM: Yes.

4493
02:58:15.306 --> 02:58:17.564
SAM: How did you get that?

4494
02:58:17.564 --> 02:58:18.683
TRAVIS: I took it.

4495
02:58:18.683 --> 02:58:21.700
LAURA, ASHLEY, MARISHA, and LIAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa!

4496
02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:23.511
MATT: So that works.

4497
02:58:23.511 --> 02:58:26.233
(yelling)

4498
02:58:26.233 --> 02:58:27.456
SAM: Clutch!

4499
02:58:27.456 --> 02:58:28.639
LIAM: It's the best spell.

4500
02:58:31.116 --> 02:58:32.907
TRAVIS: That's a 5th-level.

4501
02:58:32.907 --> 02:58:35.240
LIAM: It's why I never turn it off, ever.

4502
02:58:35.240 --> 02:58:36.224
SAM: Of course not.

4503
02:58:36.224 --> 02:58:38.630
LIAM: Why would you? Yeah, it's always on.

4504
02:58:38.630 --> 02:58:39.472
MARISHA: Fuck.

4505
02:58:39.472 --> 02:58:43.505
MATT: As that happens and the spell peters out,

4506
02:58:45.270 --> 02:58:49.110
looks back at the window, "Interesting,"

4507
02:58:49.110 --> 02:58:52.250
and is going to turn back

4508
02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:53.922
to walk towards the back of the chamber.

4509
02:58:53.922 --> 02:58:55.505
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

4510
02:58:56.465 --> 02:58:57.631
Look at all the cool stuff in there.

4511
02:58:57.631 --> 02:58:59.418
MATT: Pushes through the door into this room.

4512
02:58:59.418 --> 02:59:01.067
LAURA: Is that where the stuff was?

4513
02:59:01.067 --> 02:59:02.868
SAM: The bag of residiuum?

4514
02:59:02.868 --> 02:59:04.504
MATT: Yeah, that was the room

4515
02:59:04.504 --> 02:59:06.159
where you guys have looked through before.

4516
02:59:06.159 --> 02:59:10.742
The hobgoblin is going to hold the space here

4517
02:59:13.187 --> 02:59:16.007
and move up to front of where you are, Beau,

4518
02:59:16.007 --> 02:59:19.390
and it's going to take three attacks against you

4519
02:59:19.390 --> 02:59:21.623
with his greatsword as he unsheathes it.

4520
02:59:21.623 --> 02:59:24.090
MARISHA: Ooh, he's got a greatsword.

4521
02:59:25.545 --> 02:59:29.387
MATT: That is 23 to hit.

4522
02:59:29.387 --> 02:59:31.377
MARISHA: Hits.

4523
02:59:31.377 --> 02:59:32.405
MATT: 20 to hit.

4524
02:59:32.405 --> 02:59:33.238
MARISHA: Hits.

4525
02:59:35.488 --> 02:59:36.321
MATT: 13 to hit.

4526
02:59:36.321 --> 02:59:37.154
MARISHA: Miss.

4527
02:59:37.154 --> 02:59:37.987
MATT: So

4528
02:59:40.862 --> 02:59:44.081
Counterspell, fucking--

4529
02:59:44.081 --> 02:59:45.197
aw, this means I get to--

4530
02:59:45.197 --> 02:59:46.547
I'm going to have to throw some guys with Counterspell

4531
02:59:46.547 --> 02:59:48.656
in here too now, because we got two people with it!

4532
02:59:48.656 --> 02:59:49.818
Oh, I can't wait!

4533
02:59:49.818 --> 02:59:50.651
TRAVIS: I forgot about it when Caleb threw

4534
02:59:50.651 --> 02:59:51.701
that Fireball at us

4535
02:59:51.701 --> 02:59:53.947
and I was like, "It's sitting right here!"

4536
02:59:53.947 --> 02:59:54.988
TALIESIN: So many things we all

4537
02:59:54.988 --> 02:59:57.004
forgot in that fight, though.

4538
02:59:57.004 --> 02:59:59.573
LIAM: I never forget anything, never,

4539
02:59:59.573 --> 03:00:01.125
not names, details--
MATT: That's going to be--

4540
03:00:01.125 --> 03:00:03.806
LIAM: -- story points, spells.

4541
03:00:03.806 --> 03:00:06.111
MATT: 18 points of slashing damage on the first hit.

4542
03:00:06.111 --> 03:00:06.944
MARISHA: Jesus.

4543
03:00:08.859 --> 03:00:10.769
TALIESIN: Oh, you're taking your negative d4

4544
03:00:10.769 --> 03:00:11.602
to all those hits, right?

4545
03:00:11.602 --> 03:00:12.562
MATT: Not damage to it.

4546
03:00:12.562 --> 03:00:14.056
TALIESIN: No, I mean, so the attacks

4547
03:00:14.056 --> 03:00:15.018
you took a negative d4

4548
03:00:15.018 --> 03:00:16.237
to all three?
MATT: But 19 still hits?

4549
03:00:16.237 --> 03:00:18.177
MARISHA: No, it doesn't.

4550
03:00:18.177 --> 03:00:19.133
My AC's 20.

4551
03:00:19.133 --> 03:00:21.724
So yeah, one of them misses.

4552
03:00:21.724 --> 03:00:23.487
MARISHA: Wait, you rolled a 23.

4553
03:00:23.487 --> 03:00:25.436
MATT: 23 and a--
MARISHA: A 20?

4554
03:00:25.436 --> 03:00:26.269
MATT: And 20.

4555
03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:27.290
So the second one misses.

4556
03:00:27.290 --> 03:00:29.100
Well, the second, yeah, I miss it.

4557
03:00:29.100 --> 03:00:31.728
MARISHA: Unless you roll a four, okay, yeah.

4558
03:00:31.728 --> 03:00:33.501
MATT: All right, so that worked out well.

4559
03:00:33.501 --> 03:00:34.971
But you still take the first attack, yeah.

4560
03:00:34.971 --> 03:00:35.910
MARISHA: Okay.

4561
03:00:35.910 --> 03:00:36.743
Thanks, Caduceus.

4562
03:00:36.743 --> 03:00:38.493
MATT: That finishes his go,

4563
03:00:39.596 --> 03:00:41.781
finishing their turn.

4564
03:00:41.781 --> 03:00:42.614
Caleb, you're up.

4565
03:00:42.614 --> 03:00:46.479
LIAM: Okay, can I see in that window at all?

4566
03:00:46.479 --> 03:00:49.092
MATT: No, that window is closed.
LIAM: Is sealed, okay, good.

4567
03:00:49.092 --> 03:00:51.609
MATT: Both windows on both sides are shut.

4568
03:00:51.609 --> 03:00:53.403
LIAM: As I walk this way,

4569
03:00:53.403 --> 03:00:54.853
I send, as a bonus action,

4570
03:00:54.853 --> 03:00:58.260
I send Cat's Ire out towards the dragonborn to grab it

4571
03:00:58.260 --> 03:01:00.993
and I go five, ten, 15,

4572
03:01:00.993 --> 03:01:02.056
20.
MATT: How far can you move it?

4573
03:01:02.056 --> 03:01:03.025
LIAM: 60 feet.

4574
03:01:03.025 --> 03:01:04.975
MATT: 60 feet? So yeah, it moves right over

4575
03:01:04.975 --> 03:01:07.449
and it reaches down and scoops up the body.

4576
03:01:07.449 --> 03:01:08.831
LIAM: Now looking through the door,

4577
03:01:08.831 --> 03:01:10.996
I can see what, the hobgoblin and the goblin?

4578
03:01:10.996 --> 03:01:13.112
MATT: You can see the hobgoblin, that's all you can see.

4579
03:01:13.112 --> 03:01:13.945
LIAM: Just the hobgoblin?

4580
03:01:13.945 --> 03:01:16.085
Well, the hobgoblin's getting shot up with Magic Missiles.

4581
03:01:16.085 --> 03:01:19.361
I'm going to cast that at 3rd-level.

4582
03:01:19.361 --> 03:01:20.278
MATT: All righty.

4583
03:01:22.590 --> 03:01:23.423
LIAM: 2d4,

4584
03:01:26.173 --> 03:01:28.081
3d4, 4d4, 4d4.

4585
03:01:31.098 --> 03:01:32.465
Wanted to do the drow,

4586
03:01:32.465 --> 03:01:35.311
but the drow was through.

4587
03:01:35.311 --> 03:01:38.936
Five, eight, 12, 13

4588
03:01:42.219 --> 03:01:44.327
13 plus,

4589
03:01:44.327 --> 03:01:45.427
18 points of damage.

4590
03:01:45.427 --> 03:01:49.754
MATT: 18 points of damage to the hobgoblin, you got it,

4591
03:01:49.754 --> 03:01:50.587
all righty.

4592
03:01:50.587 --> 03:01:51.545
LIAM: Done, out of juice.

4593
03:01:51.545 --> 03:01:53.201
MATT: Finishes Caleb's go.

4594
03:01:53.201 --> 03:01:55.180
Nott.

4595
03:01:55.180 --> 03:01:56.988
You're going to go ahead and

4596
03:01:56.988 --> 03:01:59.221
take a shot at Beauregard.

4597
03:02:00.489 --> 03:02:01.740
SAM: You said Yasha, I thought?

4598
03:02:01.740 --> 03:02:03.493
MATT: Oh yeah, he did point at Yasha.

4599
03:02:03.493 --> 03:02:05.239
So taking a shot at Yasha.

4600
03:02:05.239 --> 03:02:07.501
SAM: It's the same thing, 20 something.

4601
03:02:07.501 --> 03:02:08.630
ASHLEY: Yeah, that hits.

4602
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:10.598
MATT: You do not have sneak attack on this, however,

4603
03:02:10.598 --> 03:02:13.152
because there is not an ally next to it.

4604
03:02:13.152 --> 03:02:16.110
SAM: Yeah, that's 12 points.

4605
03:02:16.110 --> 03:02:17.693
MATT: So reduced to six.

4606
03:02:18.923 --> 03:02:21.837
All right, and--

4607
03:02:21.837 --> 03:02:24.920
SAM: Do I do anything else or that's it?

4608
03:02:27.986 --> 03:02:31.429
MATT: No, I mean, the rest is up to you,

4609
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:33.701
but consider, right now you are fighting against them.

4610
03:02:33.701 --> 03:02:35.492
Tactically, you make the choices you would make

4611
03:02:35.492 --> 03:02:36.325
to fight against them.

4612
03:02:36.325 --> 03:02:37.846
SAM: Bonus action, shoot again.

4613
03:02:37.846 --> 03:02:39.090
MATT: Fire again at Yasha.

4614
03:02:39.090 --> 03:02:40.578
SAM: That's 27.

4615
03:02:40.578 --> 03:02:42.057
MATT: Go ahead and roll another attack.

4616
03:02:42.057 --> 03:02:43.290
ASHLEY: Bring it, bring it, bring it.

4617
03:02:43.290 --> 03:02:45.270
SAM: Another nine points of damage.

4618
03:02:45.270 --> 03:02:46.253
MATT: Reduced to four.

4619
03:02:46.253 --> 03:02:47.746
So Yasha's like (impacts)

4620
03:02:47.746 --> 03:02:52.245
there's just bolts sticking out of parts of the torso.

4621
03:02:52.245 --> 03:02:53.745
Angry in the door.

4622
03:02:55.034 --> 03:02:55.867
One, you're raging.

4623
03:02:55.867 --> 03:02:56.867
Two, the pain's there.

4624
03:02:56.867 --> 03:02:59.690
Three, that term used--

4625
03:02:59.690 --> 03:03:01.756
ASHLEY: Oh, that was trigger.
MATT: The whole world is just

4626
03:03:01.756 --> 03:03:04.936
(heartbeat pulsing)

4627
03:03:04.936 --> 03:03:06.832
All right, that finishes your turn, Nott.

4628
03:03:06.832 --> 03:03:09.273
Are you going to move, stay put?

4629
03:03:09.273 --> 03:03:11.526
SAM: No, I wouldn't move.

4630
03:03:11.526 --> 03:03:13.011
MATT: Okay, you stay right there.

4631
03:03:13.011 --> 03:03:15.042
That brings us to Yasha, your turn.

4632
03:03:15.042 --> 03:03:16.663
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISH:A Fuck shit up!

4633
03:03:16.663 --> 03:03:18.246
LIAM: Kill that goblin.

4634
03:03:20.187 --> 03:03:21.145
ASHLEY: Okay.

4635
03:03:21.145 --> 03:03:23.788
SAM: I never liked you, Yasha.

4636
03:03:23.788 --> 03:03:26.612
ASHLEY: I would like to

4637
03:03:26.612 --> 03:03:29.612
reach out and palm Nott's

4638
03:03:30.628 --> 03:03:32.673
head in my hand

4639
03:03:32.673 --> 03:03:34.937
and I would like to try to rip the crossbow

4640
03:03:34.937 --> 03:03:36.285
out of her hands.

4641
03:03:36.285 --> 03:03:38.083
MATT: Okay, so make an attack.

4642
03:03:38.083 --> 03:03:39.476
This is a grapple check.

4643
03:03:39.476 --> 03:03:42.047
Go ahead and roll.

4644
03:03:42.047 --> 03:03:43.464
This would be,

4645
03:03:45.923 --> 03:03:49.673
I've got to check real fast just to be sure.

4646
03:03:51.593 --> 03:03:53.260
For the grapple,

4647
03:03:59.922 --> 03:04:00.922
there we go,

4648
03:04:01.865 --> 03:04:02.698
so...

4649
03:04:04.459 --> 03:04:06.743
Yeah, you make an athletics check instead of an attack roll

4650
03:04:06.743 --> 03:04:08.948
and you have an advantage on your athletics check

4651
03:04:08.948 --> 03:04:10.781
because you are raging.

4652
03:04:13.438 --> 03:04:16.184
ASHLEY: Um, um, um, 17.

4653
03:04:16.184 --> 03:04:19.524
MATT: 17, make an acrobatics check.

4654
03:04:19.524 --> 03:04:21.448
LIAM: Especially my surgery arm.

4655
03:04:21.448 --> 03:04:23.614
SAM: 24.
ASHLEY: Fuck.

4656
03:04:23.614 --> 03:04:25.178
MATT: Being up against Nott is frustrating

4657
03:04:25.178 --> 03:04:27.124
because she's super slippery and very quick

4658
03:04:27.124 --> 03:04:28.455
and you just can't seem to grab her.

4659
03:04:28.455 --> 03:04:29.324
You can try to do a second attack.

4660
03:04:29.324 --> 03:04:31.405
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll try again, second attack.

4661
03:04:31.405 --> 03:04:35.170
MATT: Do another athletics check with advantage.

4662
03:04:35.170 --> 03:04:36.503
ASHLEY: Okay, come on.

4663
03:04:38.456 --> 03:04:39.914
17 again.

4664
03:04:39.914 --> 03:04:41.622
MATT: Acrobatics.

4665
03:04:41.622 --> 03:04:42.774
SAM: 14, 15.

4666
03:04:42.774 --> 03:04:44.357
MATT: 15.

4667
03:04:44.357 --> 03:04:45.556
You can't pull the weapon away,

4668
03:04:45.556 --> 03:04:46.392
you've got to do that next turn,

4669
03:04:46.392 --> 03:04:48.218
but you currently have Nott grappled.

4670
03:04:48.218 --> 03:04:51.481
Nott cannot move, your speed is zero.

4671
03:04:51.481 --> 03:04:55.066
Holding Nott in place through the door.

4672
03:04:55.066 --> 03:04:56.149
ASHLEY: Can I move?

4673
03:04:57.916 --> 03:04:59.374
SAM: I hate you.

4674
03:04:59.374 --> 03:05:01.046
Get off of me.

4675
03:05:01.046 --> 03:05:03.874
ASHLEY: Can I move in the room or?

4676
03:05:03.874 --> 03:05:06.416
MATT: Currently, I would say as you're holding,

4677
03:05:06.416 --> 03:05:07.862
you can move in the room,

4678
03:05:07.862 --> 03:05:09.040
unfortunately you can't.

4679
03:05:09.040 --> 03:05:10.794
If you let go of Nott, you can.

4680
03:05:10.794 --> 03:05:11.627
Otherwise,

4681
03:05:11.627 --> 03:05:13.335
you're right there.
ASHLEY: I'll just stay.

4682
03:05:13.335 --> 03:05:14.168
MATT: Okay.

4683
03:05:14.168 --> 03:05:15.001
ASHLEY: I don't want to hurt her

4684
03:05:15.001 --> 03:05:16.190
because I know she's,

4685
03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:17.196
I'm going to hurt her again if she--

4686
03:05:17.196 --> 03:05:18.358
MATT: Okay, finishes Yasha's go.

4687
03:05:18.358 --> 03:05:19.723
Jester, you're up.

4688
03:05:19.723 --> 03:05:23.045
LAURA: Can I see that Yasha's being attacked by Nott?

4689
03:05:23.045 --> 03:05:24.109
MATT: What you see is Yasha

4690
03:05:24.109 --> 03:05:25.936
with three crossbow bolts in her chest

4691
03:05:25.936 --> 03:05:29.639
and currently holding on to a scrambling Nott.

4692
03:05:29.639 --> 03:05:30.472
LAURA: Okay.

4693
03:05:33.847 --> 03:05:35.387
Okay.

4694
03:05:35.387 --> 03:05:36.470
SAM: I'll steal your stuff!

4695
03:05:37.363 --> 03:05:38.196
MARISHA: Cat claw.

4696
03:05:39.407 --> 03:05:41.673
MATT: Scoop them up like a claw machine.

4697
03:05:41.673 --> 03:05:44.510
SAM: I hate the chin tattoo.

4698
03:05:44.510 --> 03:05:45.713
I always have.

4699
03:05:45.713 --> 03:05:47.214
LAURA: I'm going to look at Nott

4700
03:05:47.214 --> 03:05:49.962
and know I've seen this thing before with Caleb

4701
03:05:49.962 --> 03:05:53.614
and I'm going to reach out and cast Dispel Magic on Nott.

4702
03:05:53.614 --> 03:05:55.531
MATT: Dispel Magic on Nott.

4703
03:05:56.474 --> 03:05:59.399
TALIESIN: Don't know if that'll, I have no idea.

4704
03:05:59.399 --> 03:06:04.399
LAURA: I can affect any magical effect.

4705
03:06:04.420 --> 03:06:06.472
SAM: (pulsing vibrations)

4706
03:06:06.472 --> 03:06:08.443
LIAM: (pulsing vibrations)

4707
03:06:08.443 --> 03:06:10.684
LAURA: (reading) "Choose one creature or magical effect

4708
03:06:10.684 --> 03:06:11.517
"within range,

4709
03:06:11.517 --> 03:06:16.267
"any spell of the 3rd-level or lower on the target ends."

4710
03:06:17.798 --> 03:06:20.215
SAM: Seems pretty cut and dried.

4711
03:06:21.280 --> 03:06:22.867
TALIESIN: You have to roll if it's higher?

4712
03:06:22.867 --> 03:06:24.117
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Sweet.

4713
03:06:27.805 --> 03:06:31.246
MATT: I'll say go ahead and just roll a d20

4714
03:06:31.246 --> 03:06:33.663
and add your wisdom modifier.

4715
03:06:34.796 --> 03:06:36.023
LIAM: Jester.

4716
03:06:36.023 --> 03:06:36.856
LAURA: Why?

4717
03:06:39.614 --> 03:06:40.447
18.

4718
03:06:40.447 --> 03:06:42.984
MATT: 18, yeah.
SAM: Wisdom modifier.

4719
03:06:42.984 --> 03:06:44.521
MATT: Nott, your eyes clear

4720
03:06:44.521 --> 03:06:47.954
and the influence from this entity--

4721
03:06:47.954 --> 03:06:48.787
LAURA: It was 14.

4722
03:06:48.787 --> 03:06:50.088
It was not my modifier,

4723
03:06:50.088 --> 03:06:51.333
I did my saving throw.

4724
03:06:51.333 --> 03:06:52.166
MATT: Oh, got you.

4725
03:06:52.166 --> 03:06:52.999
14 is still enough.

4726
03:06:52.999 --> 03:06:54.407
LAURA: Okay.

4727
03:06:54.407 --> 03:06:55.240
MATT: Barely.

4728
03:06:57.700 --> 03:06:58.925
You now have control of your--

4729
03:06:58.925 --> 03:07:01.600
SAM: (gasping)

4730
03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:03.690
Yasha.

4731
03:07:03.690 --> 03:07:06.445
ASHLEY: Stop <i>fucking</i> hitting me.

4732
03:07:06.445 --> 03:07:09.157
(laughter)

4733
03:07:09.157 --> 03:07:09.990
SAM: Eep!

4734
03:07:11.598 --> 03:07:13.777
MATT: So that's your action, you still have your movement.

4735
03:07:13.777 --> 03:07:14.610
LAURA: Okay.

4736
03:07:14.610 --> 03:07:16.110
I'm going to run over

4737
03:07:17.098 --> 03:07:20.620
so I can see in the room maybe better.

4738
03:07:20.620 --> 03:07:21.770
MATT: This way?

4739
03:07:23.707 --> 03:07:24.540
LAURA: Yeah.

4740
03:07:24.540 --> 03:07:25.943
MATT: There you can see inside the room.

4741
03:07:25.943 --> 03:07:27.991
All right, that ends your turn, Jester.

4742
03:07:27.991 --> 03:07:29.408
Fjord, you're up.

4743
03:07:32.324 --> 03:07:34.733
TRAVIS: I saw them and there's bunch of people in there.

4744
03:07:34.733 --> 03:07:35.772
MATT: Yeah, they're all rushing.

4745
03:07:35.772 --> 03:07:36.849
TRAVIS: They're doing shit.

4746
03:07:36.849 --> 03:07:39.614
How far away from me is the dragonborn body

4747
03:07:39.614 --> 03:07:42.530
and the giant flaming orange cat paw?

4748
03:07:42.530 --> 03:07:44.687
MATT: It's about 50 feet from you.

4749
03:07:44.687 --> 03:07:46.645
TRAVIS: Shit.

4750
03:07:46.645 --> 03:07:48.483
Yeah, I was going to come over

4751
03:07:48.483 --> 03:07:50.924
and give it a little authority, though.

4752
03:07:50.924 --> 03:07:51.970
MATT: It's up to you.
LAURA: Can you go

4753
03:07:51.970 --> 03:07:54.178
through the window?

4754
03:07:54.178 --> 03:07:55.261
Get in there.

4755
03:07:59.076 --> 03:08:00.974
TRAVIS: Are there people on the street?

4756
03:08:00.974 --> 03:08:02.432
MATT: There are some.

4757
03:08:02.432 --> 03:08:04.542
Yeah, it's morning.

4758
03:08:04.542 --> 03:08:06.522
Now that you've looked around to notice,

4759
03:08:06.522 --> 03:08:10.222
yes, there are people who have stopped and turned

4760
03:08:10.222 --> 03:08:12.751
because a horse got murdered in the street

4761
03:08:12.751 --> 03:08:16.916
and there's been spells flinging and shouts and yelling

4762
03:08:16.916 --> 03:08:19.766
and there are people marching to the front of the apothecary

4763
03:08:19.766 --> 03:08:20.600
and starting a fight.

4764
03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:21.899
There is definitely a spectacle.

4765
03:08:21.899 --> 03:08:23.828
TRAVIS: I still look like a very rich drow.

4766
03:08:23.828 --> 03:08:26.200
I'm going to pull out the symbol of the Bright Queen

4767
03:08:26.200 --> 03:08:28.128
and I'm going to run towards the cat's paw

4768
03:08:28.128 --> 03:08:30.685
and I'm going to say: Business of the Bright Queen,

4769
03:08:30.685 --> 03:08:32.127
clear the streets.

4770
03:08:32.127 --> 03:08:34.796
MATT: All right, make a deception check, please.

4771
03:08:34.796 --> 03:08:35.629
TRAVIS: Okay.

4772
03:08:38.775 --> 03:08:40.280
Ugh, 11.

4773
03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:43.403
MATT: 11, okay, you didn't biff it,

4774
03:08:43.403 --> 03:08:45.332
but people you have people's attention.

4775
03:08:45.332 --> 03:08:47.994
You're not sure if they believe you yet.

4776
03:08:47.994 --> 03:08:49.103
You may have to continue to push this

4777
03:08:49.103 --> 03:08:51.304
to try and sway them.

4778
03:08:51.304 --> 03:08:52.512
That's going to be your movement and your action

4779
03:08:52.512 --> 03:08:53.728
to do so.
TRAVIS: Yep.

4780
03:08:53.728 --> 03:08:54.794
MATT: All right, that finishes Fjord's go.

4781
03:08:54.794 --> 03:08:56.955
Beau, you're up.

4782
03:08:56.955 --> 03:08:59.101
MARISHA: Okay, Nott's good,

4783
03:08:59.101 --> 03:09:01.172
going all in on this bugbear.

4784
03:09:01.172 --> 03:09:02.444
That's who's in front of me, right?

4785
03:09:02.444 --> 03:09:03.277
MATT: Hobgoblin.

4786
03:09:03.277 --> 03:09:05.898
MARISHA: Hobgoblin, going all in on this hobgoblin.

4787
03:09:05.898 --> 03:09:06.898
MATT: Go for it.

4788
03:09:07.732 --> 03:09:10.160
SAM: (scat singing)

4789
03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:13.343
MARISHA: (scat singing)

4790
03:09:13.343 --> 03:09:18.343
Okay. First, I'm going to do both my attacks.

4791
03:09:18.358 --> 03:09:19.940
Same time, but how?

4792
03:09:19.940 --> 03:09:21.729
Wow, cool, cool.

4793
03:09:21.729 --> 03:09:23.424
One's a natural one.

4794
03:09:23.424 --> 03:09:24.718
The other's 23, though.

4795
03:09:24.718 --> 03:09:26.203
MATT: 23 does hit.

4796
03:09:26.203 --> 03:09:28.149
The first time you reach out,

4797
03:09:28.149 --> 03:09:29.804
you actually end up punching

4798
03:09:29.804 --> 03:09:32.006
right in the middle of the plate armor that it's wearing

4799
03:09:32.006 --> 03:09:34.429
and (clanging) you pull your fist back

4800
03:09:34.429 --> 03:09:36.341
and then punch with the other hand

4801
03:09:36.341 --> 03:09:38.164
and make impact.

4802
03:09:38.164 --> 03:09:40.283
MARISHA: Okay, that's good, that's good.

4803
03:09:40.283 --> 03:09:42.336
That's 11.

4804
03:09:42.336 --> 03:09:45.235
MATT: 11 points of damage. Great.

4805
03:09:45.235 --> 03:09:46.424
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

4806
03:09:46.424 --> 03:09:47.849
MATT: All righty.

4807
03:09:48.923 --> 03:09:51.279
It's a natural one.

4808
03:09:51.279 --> 03:09:52.893
It's going to use Indomitable

4809
03:09:52.893 --> 03:09:54.586
to reroll the saving throw.

4810
03:09:54.586 --> 03:09:56.718
TALIESIN: You also have the d4 on the saving throw.

4811
03:09:56.718 --> 03:09:59.015
MATT: That's right, yeah.

4812
03:09:59.015 --> 03:10:00.291
TALIESIN: I will continue to say that.

4813
03:10:00.291 --> 03:10:02.374
MATT: That's going to be with a

4814
03:10:05.749 --> 03:10:07.812
22 minus four, 18, does that beat it?

4815
03:10:07.812 --> 03:10:09.162
MARISHA: I think it, yes, yes.

4816
03:10:09.162 --> 03:10:10.842
TALIESIN: Even with a d4?

4817
03:10:10.842 --> 03:10:13.819
MATT: It rolled 22 and then I rolled a four on the d4

4818
03:10:13.819 --> 03:10:15.957
so it brought it down to 18.

4819
03:10:15.957 --> 03:10:17.060
This guy's pretty tough.

4820
03:10:17.060 --> 03:10:18.035
He's got a high constitution.

4821
03:10:18.035 --> 03:10:19.280
Anyway, so that's your second strike.

4822
03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:21.092
You have a bonus action still.

4823
03:10:21.092 --> 03:10:24.592
He's a big, beefy hobgoblin in plate mail.

4824
03:10:26.943 --> 03:10:28.034
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

4825
03:10:28.034 --> 03:10:29.190
MATT: Go for it, two more strikes.

4826
03:10:29.190 --> 03:10:30.023
MARISHA: Pop, pop.

4827
03:10:31.169 --> 03:10:32.483
Jesus Christ.

4828
03:10:32.483 --> 03:10:34.702
20 for one and 13 for the other.

4829
03:10:34.702 --> 03:10:36.085
MATT: 13 misses, 20 does hit, though.

4830
03:10:36.085 --> 03:10:37.040
Roll damage on that other strike.

4831
03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:41.102
MARISHA: Piece of shit, fucking piece of seven, shit.

4832
03:10:41.102 --> 03:10:42.871
MATT: Seven points of damage.
MARISHA: Balls.

4833
03:10:42.871 --> 03:10:44.279
MATT: All righty. Is that your turn?

4834
03:10:44.279 --> 03:10:45.112
MARISHA: Yes.

4835
03:10:45.112 --> 03:10:46.837
MATT: All right, Beau finishes her go.

4836
03:10:46.837 --> 03:10:47.807
That brings us to Caduceus,

4837
03:10:47.807 --> 03:10:51.578
who has now appeared at the window.

4838
03:10:51.578 --> 03:10:54.602
TALIESIN: Is that window to my right open?

4839
03:10:54.602 --> 03:10:55.831
MATT: This is closed, it is shuttered.

4840
03:10:55.831 --> 03:10:56.664
TALIESIN: This is a shuttered window?

4841
03:10:56.664 --> 03:10:58.854
MATT: It is two wooden shutters that are closed.

4842
03:10:58.854 --> 03:11:03.420
TALIESIN: Hmm, okay, really quick just to see.

4843
03:11:03.420 --> 03:11:05.037
SAM: Our plan is perfect.

4844
03:11:05.037 --> 03:11:06.671
MARISHA: (laughs)

4845
03:11:06.671 --> 03:11:08.955
TALIESIN: That is-- da buh da buh da.

4846
03:11:08.955 --> 03:11:11.038
The way things are going,

4847
03:11:13.236 --> 03:11:16.986
I'm going to cast,

4848
03:11:18.649 --> 03:11:22.011
I can't do Sacred Flame through the window, can I?

4849
03:11:22.011 --> 03:11:22.844
MATT: You can.

4850
03:11:22.844 --> 03:11:24.105
Sacred Flame doesn't fire to them,

4851
03:11:24.105 --> 03:11:25.575
it just apparates on them.

4852
03:11:25.575 --> 03:11:27.930
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to do Sacred Flame

4853
03:11:27.930 --> 03:11:29.772
on the bugbear on the inside.

4854
03:11:29.772 --> 03:11:30.780
MATT: On the hobgoblin.

4855
03:11:30.780 --> 03:11:33.067
TALIESIN: Hobgoblin, sorry I'm still on the bugbear.

4856
03:11:33.067 --> 03:11:36.825
MATT: Okay, natural 19 plus dex save,

4857
03:11:36.825 --> 03:11:38.102
that makes it a 21.

4858
03:11:38.102 --> 03:11:40.081
TALIESIN: With the d4?

4859
03:11:40.081 --> 03:11:41.498
MATT: Ooh, thank you for reminding me.

4860
03:11:41.498 --> 03:11:42.931
TALIESIN: It's still going to be too high.

4861
03:11:42.931 --> 03:11:43.921
MATT: Minus one, so 20.

4862
03:11:43.921 --> 03:11:46.171
TALIESIN: Yeah, never mind.
MATT: Sorry.

4863
03:11:48.593 --> 03:11:49.426
TALIESIN: Yeah, nothing happens.

4864
03:11:49.426 --> 03:11:50.606
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Okay,

4865
03:11:50.606 --> 03:11:54.912
I'm going to just back a few feet, just a--

4866
03:11:54.912 --> 03:11:55.829
MATT: Five, ten?

4867
03:11:57.547 --> 03:11:58.380
TALIESIN: Actually, you know what,

4868
03:11:58.380 --> 03:11:59.213
I'm going to stay at the window

4869
03:11:59.213 --> 03:12:01.944
and just keep my eye open on things for now.

4870
03:12:01.944 --> 03:12:03.292
MATT: Okay, cool.

4871
03:12:03.292 --> 03:12:05.146
Finishes Caduceus' go.

4872
03:12:05.146 --> 03:12:08.037
It is now the hobgoblin's turn.

4873
03:12:08.037 --> 03:12:11.277
The hobgoblin is going to go ahead and--

4874
03:12:11.277 --> 03:12:12.110
LIAM: No, Siri.

4875
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:13.583
MATT: Siri, no, it's not your turn.

4876
03:12:13.583 --> 03:12:15.202
TRAVIS: No!
ASHLEY: Shush.

4877
03:12:15.202 --> 03:12:17.785
MATT: It's going to go ahead and make,

4878
03:12:18.821 --> 03:12:20.819
It's going to do all its strikes on you

4879
03:12:20.819 --> 03:12:22.966
because you're the one who's attacking up front.

4880
03:12:22.966 --> 03:12:25.701
It's barely noticed that Nott's no longer an issue,

4881
03:12:25.701 --> 03:12:27.337
but you're the one who's now punching

4882
03:12:27.337 --> 03:12:29.523
and going for marks and yeah,

4883
03:12:29.523 --> 03:12:30.356
he just wants to finish you off.

4884
03:12:30.356 --> 03:12:31.689
First attack,

4885
03:12:35.564 --> 03:12:36.397
24.

4886
03:12:37.455 --> 03:12:38.880
MARISHA: Yes. Is that with the minus d4?

4887
03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:40.796
MATT: Yes.
MARISHA: Yep.

4888
03:12:40.796 --> 03:12:42.612
MATT: Next attack is

4889
03:12:44.679 --> 03:12:46.204
natural one.

4890
03:12:46.204 --> 03:12:47.864
MARISHA: Okay.

4891
03:12:47.864 --> 03:12:50.472
MATT: That, however, is going to be a

4892
03:12:52.405 --> 03:12:53.238
25.

4893
03:12:53.238 --> 03:12:54.984
So two hit you.

4894
03:13:01.688 --> 03:13:04.105
18 points of slashing damage.

4895
03:13:08.810 --> 03:13:11.227
20 points of slashing damage.

4896
03:13:12.838 --> 03:13:14.746
With the second strike,

4897
03:13:14.746 --> 03:13:16.402
the blade carves through the front of your chest

4898
03:13:16.402 --> 03:13:17.973
and there's a splatter of blood

4899
03:13:17.973 --> 03:13:20.908
as the blade carves up through past your neck

4900
03:13:20.908 --> 03:13:23.673
and just barely misses a vital vein.

4901
03:13:23.673 --> 03:13:24.754
It's enough force,

4902
03:13:24.754 --> 03:13:27.506
splattered the back of the wall to the side.

4903
03:13:27.506 --> 03:13:30.839
MARISHA: Big sword, tight quarters, big sword.

4904
03:13:33.737 --> 03:13:36.070
TRAVIS: Big sword, tight quarters.

4905
03:13:37.411 --> 03:13:38.828
MATT: That finishes its turn.

4906
03:13:38.828 --> 03:13:39.784
Caleb, you're up.

4907
03:13:39.784 --> 03:13:44.565
LIAM: Striding in a straight line for ten, 15, 20, 25, 30

4908
03:13:44.565 --> 03:13:46.832
towards the straight line behind Jester

4909
03:13:46.832 --> 03:13:49.802
and I also heard that voice calling out

4910
03:13:49.802 --> 03:13:51.218
about the order of the Bright Queen.

4911
03:13:51.218 --> 03:13:52.942
I'm smart enough to figure out what that is.

4912
03:13:52.942 --> 03:13:55.738
I try to subtly draw in Cat's Ire

4913
03:13:55.738 --> 03:13:59.291
and the claw carries the dragonborn body

4914
03:13:59.291 --> 03:14:01.970
and hovers by this drow's side

4915
03:14:01.970 --> 03:14:05.196
as if the drow had summoned it, right by his side

4916
03:14:05.196 --> 03:14:09.480
and Magic Missile 3rd-level again

4917
03:14:09.480 --> 03:14:13.120
through the door at the same target.

4918
03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:15.478
Okay, so that is, that was one, two, three, four, five,

4919
03:14:15.478 --> 03:14:16.319
of these guys.

4920
03:14:16.319 --> 03:14:19.889
One, two, three, four, five,

4921
03:14:19.889 --> 03:14:24.647
four, eight, ooh, ooh! Oh, they were all fours!

4922
03:14:24.647 --> 03:14:25.880
All of them!

4923
03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:27.207
MATT: That's beautiful.

4924
03:14:29.207 --> 03:14:30.796
LIAM: 25.

4925
03:14:30.796 --> 03:14:34.066
They just spiral around Jester and Yasha.

4926
03:14:34.066 --> 03:14:36.989
MATT: Past the arms, through the legs,

4927
03:14:36.989 --> 03:14:37.862
hitting the armor.

4928
03:14:37.862 --> 03:14:39.790
You watch the plate dent with each impact.

4929
03:14:39.790 --> 03:14:41.787
There's all these giant heavy pock marks.

4930
03:14:41.787 --> 03:14:42.811
They've blasted into it.

4931
03:14:42.811 --> 03:14:44.277
You can see the the force

4932
03:14:44.277 --> 03:14:46.377
causing it to push into elements of his chest

4933
03:14:46.377 --> 03:14:51.377
and the hobgoblin's like, (grunting).

4934
03:14:51.685 --> 03:14:55.185
Looks at you through the door and is like (grunting).

4935
03:14:57.483 --> 03:14:58.819
Does that finish your turn?

4936
03:14:58.819 --> 03:14:59.652
LIAM: Yes, it does.

4937
03:14:59.652 --> 03:15:00.485
MATT: All righty.

4938
03:15:00.485 --> 03:15:02.246
That brings us to Nott.

4939
03:15:02.246 --> 03:15:04.758
SAM: I'm going to run past the hobgoblin and

4940
03:15:04.758 --> 03:15:07.160
dart into the side room.
MATT: I assume you've dropped your grapple?

4941
03:15:07.160 --> 03:15:08.826
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

4942
03:15:08.826 --> 03:15:10.862
You're going to dart past the hobgoblin.

4943
03:15:10.862 --> 03:15:14.030
SAM: Yeah, and into the side room.

4944
03:15:14.030 --> 03:15:15.453
MARISHA: Keep your eyes on that piece of shit.

4945
03:15:15.453 --> 03:15:17.786
MATT: You step into the room.

4946
03:15:18.873 --> 03:15:21.367
The chamber is empty,

4947
03:15:21.367 --> 03:15:25.124
and the the back slats on the window are open.

4948
03:15:25.124 --> 03:15:27.450
SAM: I'm going to dash through it.

4949
03:15:27.450 --> 03:15:30.845
MATT: Okay, so that's five, ten, 15, 20.

4950
03:15:30.845 --> 03:15:34.875
Did you do a disengage?

4951
03:15:34.875 --> 03:15:36.138
SAM: No.

4952
03:15:36.138 --> 03:15:38.408
No, I need that to run.

4953
03:15:38.408 --> 03:15:40.333
MATT: That would be--

4954
03:15:40.333 --> 03:15:41.174
TALIESIN: Minus four.

4955
03:15:41.174 --> 03:15:43.507
MATT: Minus four. Rolled a four.

4956
03:15:44.541 --> 03:15:45.776
17.

4957
03:15:45.776 --> 03:15:47.434
SAM: 18.

4958
03:15:47.434 --> 03:15:48.692
MATT: Slams into the wood behind you

4959
03:15:48.692 --> 03:15:50.827
splintering elements to the floor.

4960
03:15:50.827 --> 03:15:53.131
All right, so that's

4961
03:15:53.131 --> 03:15:54.302
35.

4962
03:15:54.302 --> 03:15:56.021
That's your movement 35 there.

4963
03:15:56.021 --> 03:15:56.854
SAM: Dash.

4964
03:15:56.854 --> 03:15:57.687
MATT: Dash out.

4965
03:15:57.687 --> 03:15:59.181
You leap out into the middle of the hall

4966
03:15:59.181 --> 03:16:01.306
and though the back alley.

4967
03:16:01.306 --> 03:16:03.223
You don't see anything.

4968
03:16:04.304 --> 03:16:05.198
SAM: That's action and,

4969
03:16:05.198 --> 03:16:07.428
no, that's movement and bonus

4970
03:16:07.428 --> 03:16:08.261
MATT: Movement and bonus.

4971
03:16:08.261 --> 03:16:10.344
You still have an action.

4972
03:16:12.241 --> 03:16:13.074
SAM: Who can find--

4973
03:16:14.810 --> 03:16:17.277
I will message Jester.

4974
03:16:18.671 --> 03:16:21.764
Wait, who can find things, people?

4975
03:16:21.764 --> 03:16:22.735
Jester can.

4976
03:16:22.735 --> 03:16:24.750
I will message Jester.

4977
03:16:24.750 --> 03:16:26.927
I need you in the back,

4978
03:16:26.927 --> 03:16:29.927
I need you the back alley right now.

4979
03:16:30.852 --> 03:16:32.495
MATT: Okay, that finishes your turn.

4980
03:16:32.495 --> 03:16:33.476
Yasha, you're up.

4981
03:16:33.476 --> 03:16:35.476
LAURA: Am I allowed to reply?

4982
03:16:37.084 --> 03:16:38.910
SAM: You can reply to this message.

4983
03:16:38.910 --> 03:16:40.243
LIAM: That's it.
TALIESIN: And you did.

4984
03:16:42.113 --> 03:16:44.510
TRAVIS: "Am I allowed to reply?"

4985
03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:47.369
ASHLEY: How far is it to that back window

4986
03:16:47.369 --> 03:16:48.531
if I were to just keep going?

4987
03:16:48.531 --> 03:16:50.239
MATT: This way?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4988
03:16:50.239 --> 03:16:51.072
MATT: You're not sure.

4989
03:16:51.072 --> 03:16:52.424
You'd have to run to try and find out.

4990
03:16:52.424 --> 03:16:53.779
You aren't even aware there's a back window right now.

4991
03:16:53.779 --> 03:16:54.612
You just know there's a back room.

4992
03:16:54.612 --> 03:16:56.278
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm just going to go up

4993
03:16:56.278 --> 03:16:57.918
and I'm going to attack this hobgoblin.

4994
03:16:57.918 --> 03:17:00.745
MATT: All right, so you move into this cluttered room.

4995
03:17:00.745 --> 03:17:02.163
It's hard with this giant greatsword.

4996
03:17:02.163 --> 03:17:03.699
You have to push off the wall

4997
03:17:03.699 --> 03:17:06.982
and with your best ability strike it

4998
03:17:06.982 --> 03:17:08.403
with the Magician's Judge.

4999
03:17:08.403 --> 03:17:09.236
ASHLEY: 19.

5000
03:17:09.236 --> 03:17:10.069
MATT: 19 hits.

5001
03:17:11.649 --> 03:17:13.115
ASHLEY: Okay.

5002
03:17:17.545 --> 03:17:21.374
That is 13 points for the first hit.

5003
03:17:21.374 --> 03:17:23.689
MATT: That was with the additional d6, right?

5004
03:17:23.689 --> 03:17:24.691
ASHLEY: No, it was not.

5005
03:17:24.691 --> 03:17:25.524
MATT: That's your first attack,

5006
03:17:25.524 --> 03:17:26.898
always gets the additional d6 and the--

5007
03:17:26.898 --> 03:17:28.006
ASHLEY: d6.
MATT: Yeah.

5008
03:17:29.450 --> 03:17:31.228
ASHLEY: With an additional six.

5009
03:17:31.228 --> 03:17:33.145
MATT: So 19 points of damage.

5010
03:17:34.083 --> 03:17:35.166
ASHLEY: Second hit.

5011
03:17:39.956 --> 03:17:40.899
11.

5012
03:17:40.899 --> 03:17:41.999
MATT: 11 misses.
ASHLEY: Ugh!

5013
03:17:41.999 --> 03:17:43.315
MATT: I'm sorry.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5014
03:17:43.315 --> 03:17:44.356
MATT: Don't forget, you can go reckless if you want to,

5015
03:17:44.356 --> 03:17:45.230
just for future rounds.

5016
03:17:45.230 --> 03:17:47.171
ASHLEY: Might as well because I'm going to get hit anyway.

5017
03:17:47.171 --> 03:17:48.512
MATT: Well, yeah.
ASHLEY: Next time.

5018
03:17:48.512 --> 03:17:49.670
MATT: Next time.

5019
03:17:49.670 --> 03:17:52.251
All right, so the first strike impacts.

5020
03:17:52.251 --> 03:17:53.646
It's now you and Beauregard

5021
03:17:53.646 --> 03:17:55.043
gathered in this space

5022
03:17:55.043 --> 03:17:56.473
and you see him looking over his shoulder

5023
03:17:56.473 --> 03:17:59.326
back towards where his companion ran off to.

5024
03:17:59.326 --> 03:18:01.241
ASHLEY: Am I able to get to a point in the--

5025
03:18:01.241 --> 03:18:03.235
I'm sorry, so we're flanking?

5026
03:18:03.235 --> 03:18:04.590
MATT: Yeah, you can move around.

5027
03:18:04.590 --> 03:18:06.978
I'll say from [inaudible] You can get about there.

5028
03:18:06.978 --> 03:18:08.366
ASHLEY: Still keeping my eye on the back.

5029
03:18:08.366 --> 03:18:10.002
MATT: Okay, yes,

5030
03:18:10.002 --> 03:18:11.677
you're not leaving combat range.

5031
03:18:11.677 --> 03:18:12.577
You got it.

5032
03:18:13.606 --> 03:18:14.553
Technically, if you were flanking before

5033
03:18:14.553 --> 03:18:17.454
that would gotten, that's fine.

5034
03:18:17.454 --> 03:18:19.537
ASHLEY: That's okay, I didn't see that before.

5035
03:18:19.537 --> 03:18:21.337
MATT: All right. That finishes your go, Yasha.

5036
03:18:21.337 --> 03:18:22.702
Jester.

5037
03:18:22.702 --> 03:18:27.374
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to run around the side.

5038
03:18:27.374 --> 03:18:28.207
MATT: This way?

5039
03:18:28.207 --> 03:18:29.290
LAURA: No, like whichever.

5040
03:18:29.290 --> 03:18:31.289
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30.

5041
03:18:31.289 --> 03:18:33.906
LAURA: Double dash it.

5042
03:18:35.097 --> 03:18:36.763
MATT: 30. You just get to the back

5043
03:18:36.763 --> 03:18:38.092
and you can see Nott currently standing there

5044
03:18:38.092 --> 03:18:41.443
in the middle of the back alley going (panting).

5045
03:18:41.443 --> 03:18:42.592
LAURA: Where'd they go?

5046
03:18:42.592 --> 03:18:43.901
SAM: I don't know.

5047
03:18:43.901 --> 03:18:45.454
You go that way, I'll go this way.

5048
03:18:45.454 --> 03:18:48.528
LAURA: Wait, I can Locate Object.

5049
03:18:48.528 --> 03:18:50.635
That's all I can do for this turn though, right?

5050
03:18:50.635 --> 03:18:51.865
MATT: Yeah, that's all you can do.

5051
03:18:51.865 --> 03:18:52.995
ASHLEY: There's an additional four points

5052
03:18:52.995 --> 03:18:55.543
because I forgot to add for Divine Fury.

5053
03:18:55.543 --> 03:18:56.524
MATT: Yes, don't forget that.

5054
03:18:56.524 --> 03:18:57.721
All right.

5055
03:18:57.721 --> 03:19:01.095
That's 24 points damage on that opening attack.

5056
03:19:01.095 --> 03:19:03.182
All right, that finishes Jester's go.

5057
03:19:03.182 --> 03:19:04.793
Fjord, you're up.

5058
03:19:04.793 --> 03:19:07.022
You can see now folks are starting to gather

5059
03:19:07.022 --> 03:19:08.921
and you can see in in the back,

5060
03:19:08.921 --> 03:19:10.659
looks like someone has ran off

5061
03:19:10.659 --> 03:19:15.659
and gotten the attention of two Aurora Watch soldiers.

5062
03:19:15.874 --> 03:19:18.482
that are looking over and discussing.

5063
03:19:18.482 --> 03:19:20.487
So what are you doing?

5064
03:19:20.487 --> 03:19:22.516
TRAVIS: Everyone, please return to your homes.

5065
03:19:22.516 --> 03:19:23.839
It's safer there.

5066
03:19:23.839 --> 03:19:25.608
Clear the streets, please.

5067
03:19:25.608 --> 03:19:26.833
And I'll just keep walking

5068
03:19:26.833 --> 03:19:28.756
showing the symbol

5069
03:19:28.756 --> 03:19:31.572
and backing up into the

5070
03:19:31.572 --> 03:19:34.015
passageway between the two buildings.

5071
03:19:34.015 --> 03:19:35.594
MATT: Deception check.

5072
03:19:35.594 --> 03:19:36.639
TRAVIS: Perception or deception?

5073
03:19:36.639 --> 03:19:37.472
MATT: Deception.

5074
03:19:37.472 --> 03:19:39.807
TRAVIS: Deception, 28.

5075
03:19:39.807 --> 03:19:41.903
MATT: 28.

5076
03:19:41.903 --> 03:19:43.103
TRAVIS: That's way better.

5077
03:19:43.103 --> 03:19:44.864
MATT: All the figures in the immediate vicinity like--

5078
03:19:46.897 --> 03:19:49.077
and shuffle and go back to their business and start,

5079
03:19:49.077 --> 03:19:52.106
and the Aurora Watch soldiers are still walking this way,

5080
03:19:52.106 --> 03:19:53.023
but they're a ways off.

5081
03:19:53.023 --> 03:19:55.252
They'll get there in two rounds.

5082
03:19:55.252 --> 03:19:57.344
They don't seem rushed, especially with you shouting,

5083
03:19:57.344 --> 03:19:59.081
but they're definitely curious.

5084
03:19:59.081 --> 03:20:00.137
You get to move back

5085
03:20:00.137 --> 03:20:02.538
and you get all the way into the corner of here

5086
03:20:02.538 --> 03:20:04.134
and that's your turn.

5087
03:20:04.134 --> 03:20:05.753
All right, but you definitely seem

5088
03:20:05.753 --> 03:20:09.044
to have gotten rid of a lot of the immediate attention

5089
03:20:09.044 --> 03:20:10.932
and curiosity about this throwdown.

5090
03:20:10.932 --> 03:20:11.828
TRAVIS: Return the street to normal

5091
03:20:11.828 --> 03:20:13.448
in case anybody else is coming.

5092
03:20:13.448 --> 03:20:15.656
MATT: All right, Beauregard.

5093
03:20:15.656 --> 03:20:20.532
MARISHA: Okay, I saw Nott take off that way.

5094
03:20:20.532 --> 03:20:22.068
I'm going to go look for this guy,

5095
03:20:22.068 --> 03:20:23.390
assuming he's in here.

5096
03:20:23.390 --> 03:20:25.556
I'm going to run past and go through the window as well

5097
03:20:25.556 --> 03:20:26.964
into the other room.

5098
03:20:26.964 --> 03:20:28.247
MATT: Okay.

5099
03:20:31.217 --> 03:20:33.617
LAURA: Still take care of the hobgoblin, though.

5100
03:20:33.617 --> 03:20:35.069
MARISHA: Yeah, Yasha's there.

5101
03:20:35.069 --> 03:20:36.372
MATT: You're at the window with 40 feet.

5102
03:20:36.372 --> 03:20:37.299
You can try and go through.

5103
03:20:37.299 --> 03:20:38.132
MARISHA: Go through.

5104
03:20:38.132 --> 03:20:40.298
MATT: All right. Acrobatics check if you want to try

5105
03:20:40.298 --> 03:20:43.199
and not lose any movement.

5106
03:20:43.199 --> 03:20:44.660
MARISHA: That's a natural 19,

5107
03:20:44.660 --> 03:20:45.493
so 28.
MATT: Yeah, no worries.

5108
03:20:45.493 --> 03:20:47.455
You just like one hand, vault off

5109
03:20:47.455 --> 03:20:48.682
and land on the ground.

5110
03:20:48.682 --> 03:20:49.759
That's your movement.

5111
03:20:49.759 --> 03:20:51.763
You still have your action and bonus, still.

5112
03:20:51.763 --> 03:20:53.290
LAURA: Hi.

5113
03:20:53.290 --> 03:20:54.956
MARISHA: What's going on? Where is he?

5114
03:20:54.956 --> 03:20:56.351
LAURA: He ran away.

5115
03:20:56.351 --> 03:20:57.826
MARISHA: Ugh!

5116
03:20:58.665 --> 03:21:01.428
I'm going to go the opposite direction that Nott went.

5117
03:21:01.428 --> 03:21:02.678
I'm going to dash.

5118
03:21:03.668 --> 03:21:05.372
MATT: All right and then dash as well?

5119
03:21:05.372 --> 03:21:07.060
Step of the Wind or just dash?

5120
03:21:07.060 --> 03:21:10.527
MARISHA: Dash and then do I see anything back where I am?

5121
03:21:10.527 --> 03:21:11.360
MATT: Are you bonus action dashing

5122
03:21:11.360 --> 03:21:12.763
or using an action--
MARISHA: Just bonus action dashing

5123
03:21:12.763 --> 03:21:13.596
for now.

5124
03:21:13.596 --> 03:21:15.273
MATT: All right, so you're spending a ki point

5125
03:21:15.273 --> 03:21:16.884
to Step of the Wind to get over there.

5126
03:21:16.884 --> 03:21:18.550
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

5127
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:19.383
Then you're using action to

5128
03:21:19.383 --> 03:21:21.085
go ahead and roll a perception check

5129
03:21:21.085 --> 03:21:22.003
as you're now taking your action

5130
03:21:22.003 --> 03:21:24.135
to actively perceive any sign

5131
03:21:24.135 --> 03:21:27.302
of anything that might catch your eye.

5132
03:21:29.866 --> 03:21:31.402
MARISHA: Six.

5133
03:21:31.402 --> 03:21:33.897
MATT: Unfortunately, with the adrenaline pumping in your

5134
03:21:33.897 --> 03:21:35.818
head and the chaos that happened in there

5135
03:21:35.818 --> 03:21:38.282
and honestly being the in the dark interior for a second

5136
03:21:38.282 --> 03:21:40.031
than coming out here and having to adjust

5137
03:21:40.031 --> 03:21:41.972
to the space back here

5138
03:21:41.972 --> 03:21:44.865
which you've only been once before,

5139
03:21:44.865 --> 03:21:47.208
you're not really seeing anything

5140
03:21:47.208 --> 03:21:48.532
that's catching your attention.

5141
03:21:48.532 --> 03:21:49.365
Sorry.

5142
03:21:50.346 --> 03:21:52.013
Caduceus, you're up.

5143
03:21:54.602 --> 03:21:57.570
TRAVIS: Is he still inside that fucking room?

5144
03:21:57.570 --> 03:21:58.487
LAURA: Possibly.

5145
03:21:59.903 --> 03:22:04.886
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action to use--

5146
03:22:06.591 --> 03:22:09.599
no, I'm going to do another Sacred Flame attack for now.

5147
03:22:09.599 --> 03:22:10.706
Keeping it pretty basic.

5148
03:22:10.706 --> 03:22:12.164
MATT: Okay.

5149
03:22:12.164 --> 03:22:13.151
It does not make it.

5150
03:22:13.151 --> 03:22:16.948
With a four minus two.
TALIESIN: Okay, yay!

5151
03:22:16.948 --> 03:22:20.206
That's a 2d8.

5152
03:22:23.139 --> 03:22:24.682
Oh, that's nice,

5153
03:22:24.682 --> 03:22:28.874
that's nine, 14 points of radiant damage.

5154
03:22:28.874 --> 03:22:30.921
MATT: 14 points of radiant damage.

5155
03:22:30.921 --> 03:22:33.078
Bursts up,

5156
03:22:33.078 --> 03:22:34.557
the flames curl around the armor,

5157
03:22:34.557 --> 03:22:35.900
the face singeing,

5158
03:22:35.900 --> 03:22:38.154
some of the fur on the corners,

5159
03:22:38.154 --> 03:22:38.987
like the beard

5160
03:22:38.987 --> 03:22:42.666
and the edges of the red skin of this hobgoblin.

5161
03:22:42.666 --> 03:22:43.749
Tough fucker.

5162
03:22:44.618 --> 03:22:46.750
You going to stay put are you going to move?

5163
03:22:46.750 --> 03:22:47.767
TALIESIN: I'm going to stay there.

5164
03:22:47.767 --> 03:22:49.223
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go.

5165
03:22:49.223 --> 03:22:51.303
It's now his turn.

5166
03:22:51.303 --> 03:22:52.551
He's going to turn around.

5167
03:22:52.551 --> 03:22:54.599
Since Beau has gotten out of his grasp,

5168
03:22:54.599 --> 03:22:56.182
angry look at you.

5169
03:22:57.831 --> 03:22:59.463
"Let's finish this."

5170
03:22:59.463 --> 03:23:01.897
It's going to make all three attacks on you

5171
03:23:01.897 --> 03:23:03.893
minus the 1d4.

5172
03:23:03.893 --> 03:23:07.625
That's going to be 25 to hit.

5173
03:23:07.625 --> 03:23:08.750
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

5174
03:23:10.414 --> 03:23:13.036
MATT: He's rolling natural 18, natural 19.

5175
03:23:13.036 --> 03:23:14.431
26 to hit.

5176
03:23:14.431 --> 03:23:15.265
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

5177
03:23:15.265 --> 03:23:16.928
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

5178
03:23:16.928 --> 03:23:17.761
MATT: And

5179
03:23:19.095 --> 03:23:20.023
18.
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

5180
03:23:20.023 --> 03:23:21.937
MATT: All three hit.

5181
03:23:21.937 --> 03:23:23.287
TRAVIS: No problem.

5182
03:23:25.006 --> 03:23:27.447
Got to give them extra luck.

5183
03:23:28.597 --> 03:23:31.911
MATT: 16 points of slashing damage reduced to eight.

5184
03:23:31.911 --> 03:23:33.559
ASHLEY: Okay.

5185
03:23:33.559 --> 03:23:36.942
MATT: And, that's not a good roll for him,

5186
03:23:36.942 --> 03:23:41.545
15 points of slashing damage reduced to seven.

5187
03:23:41.545 --> 03:23:42.378
ASHLEY: Okay.

5188
03:23:42.378 --> 03:23:43.211
MATT: His bonus action,

5189
03:23:43.211 --> 03:23:44.877
he's going to use his Second Wind to--

5190
03:23:44.877 --> 03:23:47.417
TALIESIN: Oh, he's going for it.

5191
03:23:47.417 --> 03:23:49.013
MATT: So he hits you,

5192
03:23:49.013 --> 03:23:50.694
that was two attacks,

5193
03:23:50.694 --> 03:23:52.412
I have three attacks.

5194
03:23:52.412 --> 03:23:54.145
Oh, there we go.

5195
03:23:56.729 --> 03:23:59.696
21 points slashing damage reduced to ten.

5196
03:23:59.696 --> 03:24:01.222
ASHLEY: Okay.

5197
03:24:01.222 --> 03:24:02.822
MATT: Then once he finishes,

5198
03:24:02.822 --> 03:24:04.038
wham and sending you back,

5199
03:24:04.038 --> 03:24:06.534
you're having to to move heavily onto your back foot

5200
03:24:06.534 --> 03:24:08.198
as you're trying to deflect it with the Magician's Judge.

5201
03:24:08.198 --> 03:24:09.622
These two greatswords striking and sparking

5202
03:24:09.622 --> 03:24:10.902
in this dark interior,

5203
03:24:10.902 --> 03:24:12.470
lighting up the room with each impact

5204
03:24:12.470 --> 03:24:14.998
and with each strike slamming into your shoulder,

5205
03:24:14.998 --> 03:24:15.846
across the face,

5206
03:24:15.846 --> 03:24:16.819
and one finally hitting you

5207
03:24:16.819 --> 03:24:20.390
right in the middle of your--

5208
03:24:20.390 --> 03:24:21.656
TRAVIS: Clavicle?
SAM: Trap?

5209
03:24:21.656 --> 03:24:22.899
MATT: Yeah, trap, thank you.

5210
03:24:22.899 --> 03:24:24.278
It cuts in deep

5211
03:24:24.278 --> 03:24:26.502
and you fall to one knee and look up on him

5212
03:24:26.502 --> 03:24:29.110
as he draws the blade across to cut even deeper.

5213
03:24:29.110 --> 03:24:30.179
You're like, "Ugh!"

5214
03:24:30.179 --> 03:24:31.508
The anger's still pumping in you

5215
03:24:31.508 --> 03:24:32.341
and as you do,

5216
03:24:32.341 --> 03:24:35.238
he goes (breathing) and just prepares himself,

5217
03:24:35.238 --> 03:24:36.118
grinning now,

5218
03:24:36.118 --> 03:24:39.778
like he's starting to feel the adrenaline really hit, too.

5219
03:24:39.778 --> 03:24:40.611
ASHLEY: Fun.

5220
03:24:40.611 --> 03:24:42.385
MATT: That finishes his go. Caleb, you're up.

5221
03:24:42.385 --> 03:24:45.044
LIAM: Okay. I am striding towards the door

5222
03:24:45.044 --> 03:24:47.205
and as I get about this far,

5223
03:24:47.205 --> 03:24:50.710
I tell Cat's Ire to lift that dragonborn,

5224
03:24:50.710 --> 03:24:51.543
hug the building

5225
03:24:51.543 --> 03:24:53.173
and go dump it in the back.

5226
03:24:53.173 --> 03:24:54.534
By the time I get to the door,

5227
03:24:54.534 --> 03:24:56.710
I should be able to walk in the door.

5228
03:24:56.710 --> 03:24:58.020
I'm going to unload Magic Missile

5229
03:24:58.020 --> 03:24:59.462
into the back of his bugbear again

5230
03:24:59.462 --> 03:25:01.221
at a 4th-level.
LAURA: Hobgoblin.

5231
03:25:01.221 --> 03:25:02.896
LIAM: Hobgoblin, sure.

5232
03:25:02.896 --> 03:25:04.282
LAURA: Jester, as you stand there,

5233
03:25:04.282 --> 03:25:07.670
all of a sudden the body of the dragonborn

5234
03:25:07.670 --> 03:25:09.302
just splats on the ground in front of you,

5235
03:25:09.302 --> 03:25:11.030
you hear a few bones snap

5236
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:14.363
and the legs bent backwards now.

5237
03:25:17.886 --> 03:25:22.422
LIAM: 26 points from Magic Missile level four into its back,

5238
03:25:22.422 --> 03:25:25.288
4th-level.
ASHLEY: Yes, queen.

5239
03:25:25.288 --> 03:25:26.463
LIAM: And I step in.

5240
03:25:26.463 --> 03:25:27.704
MATT: And you step in?

5241
03:25:27.704 --> 03:25:29.582
LIAM: Yeah, I think so.

5242
03:25:29.582 --> 03:25:30.896
MATT: Close the door behind you as you go?

5243
03:25:30.896 --> 03:25:33.242
LIAM: That would be an action, wouldn't it?

5244
03:25:33.242 --> 03:25:34.529
If I can, I'll close it.

5245
03:25:34.529 --> 03:25:37.443
Well, no, Caduceus is outside and I saw him there, right?

5246
03:25:37.443 --> 03:25:38.337
So no.

5247
03:25:38.337 --> 03:25:40.511
MATT: Okay. Yeah, closing a door

5248
03:25:40.511 --> 03:25:41.946
it's a use an object

5249
03:25:41.946 --> 03:25:43.499
which you can do as like, well, it's not use an object,

5250
03:25:43.499 --> 03:25:44.591
that's like a--

5251
03:25:44.591 --> 03:25:47.151
you can do that as part of your movement.

5252
03:25:47.151 --> 03:25:47.984
Unless it's locked.

5253
03:25:47.984 --> 03:25:48.945
If it's locked, you have to,

5254
03:25:48.945 --> 03:25:49.995
it's an action to unlock it.
LIAM: If I saw Caduceus out there,

5255
03:25:49.995 --> 03:25:50.958
I wouldn't have shut it.

5256
03:25:50.958 --> 03:25:52.830
MATT: Okay, you're good. That finishes your turn, Caleb?

5257
03:25:52.830 --> 03:25:53.663
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

5258
03:25:53.663 --> 03:25:54.496
You just unload

5259
03:25:54.496 --> 03:25:58.518
this blast of additional arcane missiles.

5260
03:25:58.518 --> 03:26:00.366
They didn't even need to arc much.

5261
03:26:00.366 --> 03:26:02.445
This was a point blank almost just release

5262
03:26:02.445 --> 03:26:04.190
and they just blast them in the center.

5263
03:26:04.190 --> 03:26:05.023
You can see the armor

5264
03:26:05.023 --> 03:26:06.798
is now the circle where they all blasted

5265
03:26:06.798 --> 03:26:07.870
the back of the plate like

5266
03:26:07.870 --> 03:26:08.703
hangs open a little bit.

5267
03:26:08.703 --> 03:26:11.886
You've almost destroyed the back of his main chest armor.

5268
03:26:11.886 --> 03:26:13.552
LIAM: Still standing?
MATT: Still standing, yeah.

5269
03:26:13.552 --> 03:26:16.988
LIAM: Caleb looks at his own hand like: Son of a fuck.

5270
03:26:16.988 --> 03:26:19.339
That's three I've unloaded into him.

5271
03:26:19.339 --> 03:26:20.172
MATT: Nott.

5272
03:26:22.254 --> 03:26:25.587
SAM: I'm going to go the opposite way of Beau.

5273
03:26:29.186 --> 03:26:30.494
I guess bonus action dash

5274
03:26:30.494 --> 03:26:32.114
and then action to perceive.

5275
03:26:32.114 --> 03:26:33.697
MATT: Perception check.

5276
03:26:35.055 --> 03:26:36.542
SAM: Hey, better.

5277
03:26:36.542 --> 03:26:37.470
14.

5278
03:26:37.470 --> 03:26:39.227
MATT: 14, you look around,

5279
03:26:39.227 --> 03:26:42.060
you hear the wind blowing through,

5280
03:26:43.681 --> 03:26:45.672
a small pebble rolling,

5281
03:26:46.756 --> 03:26:48.258
nothing.

5282
03:26:48.258 --> 03:26:51.149
TRAVIS: What?
ASHLEY: Fuck.

5283
03:26:51.149 --> 03:26:54.144
TRAVIS: I don't know. Either that, or he Dimension Doored.

5284
03:26:54.144 --> 03:26:54.985
LAURA: It's possible.

5285
03:26:54.985 --> 03:26:56.751
MATT: That finishes your turn. Yasha, you're up.

5286
03:26:56.751 --> 03:26:59.771
ASHLEY: Okay. Ugh, okay.

5287
03:26:59.771 --> 03:27:00.798
MATT: You move into the chamber

5288
03:27:00.798 --> 03:27:03.586
and you're like-- Caleb, you're right up against

5289
03:27:03.586 --> 03:27:05.838
this guy, yeah, just so you know.

5290
03:27:05.838 --> 03:27:07.534
LIAM: I thought that would do it, but--

5291
03:27:07.534 --> 03:27:08.367
ASHLEY: We're flanking?

5292
03:27:08.367 --> 03:27:09.802
MATT: You are flanking currently, yes.

5293
03:27:09.802 --> 03:27:11.486
ASHLEY: Okay, that means we have advantage?

5294
03:27:11.486 --> 03:27:12.319
MATT: Yes, you do.

5295
03:27:12.319 --> 03:27:15.167
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, here I go.

5296
03:27:15.167 --> 03:27:16.834
I'm going to attack.

5297
03:27:18.046 --> 03:27:19.249
Oh, natural 20.

5298
03:27:19.249 --> 03:27:21.974
TRAVIS: Oh! Tee up!

5299
03:27:21.974 --> 03:27:23.056
MATT: That'll do.

5300
03:27:23.910 --> 03:27:24.926
ASHLEY: Okay.

5301
03:27:24.926 --> 03:27:25.759
That is...

5302
03:27:29.409 --> 03:27:30.926
ugh,

5303
03:27:30.926 --> 03:27:33.483
Savage Attack, I'm going to reroll these.

5304
03:27:33.483 --> 03:27:38.483
That's four, five, seven, so 13 or

5305
03:27:40.846 --> 03:27:45.846
that's a little better, eight, nine, nine,

5306
03:27:46.637 --> 03:27:49.006
16 for the first hit.

5307
03:27:49.006 --> 03:27:50.256
So double that.

5308
03:27:52.722 --> 03:27:54.731
MATT: Was that before you added your modifier?

5309
03:27:54.731 --> 03:27:57.072
What was the damage before you added your?

5310
03:27:57.072 --> 03:27:59.982
ASHLEY: Oh sorry, nine, nine.

5311
03:27:59.982 --> 03:28:04.054
MATT: So 18 plus whatever your rage and strength is.

5312
03:28:04.054 --> 03:28:06.166
ASHLEY: Plus whatever my rage and strength is.

5313
03:28:06.166 --> 03:28:10.857
Yeah, that's plus seven, right?

5314
03:28:10.857 --> 03:28:11.812
Yeah.

5315
03:28:11.812 --> 03:28:16.687
MATT: Right. The total would be 18 plus seven, yeah.

5316
03:28:18.153 --> 03:28:20.182
TALIESIN: Oof, that's rough.

5317
03:28:20.182 --> 03:28:21.848
MATT: Okay. That's the first strike.

5318
03:28:21.848 --> 03:28:22.681
Second attack.

5319
03:28:22.681 --> 03:28:24.014
ASHLEY: Second attack.

5320
03:28:26.264 --> 03:28:27.598
Yeah, okay.

5321
03:28:28.471 --> 03:28:29.830
24.

5322
03:28:29.830 --> 03:28:32.014
MATT: 24 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

5323
03:28:32.014 --> 03:28:34.878
TRAVIS: No brutal critical for you, right?

5324
03:28:34.878 --> 03:28:36.788
MATT: Actually, you should at this level.

5325
03:28:36.788 --> 03:28:38.972
I think you got that at level nine.

5326
03:28:38.972 --> 03:28:39.854
That means you get to roll

5327
03:28:39.854 --> 03:28:41.702
an additional d6 in damage, I believe.

5328
03:28:41.702 --> 03:28:42.535
ASHLEY: Really?

5329
03:28:42.535 --> 03:28:45.110
MATT: It's the ability you got this last level, I think.

5330
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:47.798
Brutal Critical, 9th-level, yes, you roll an additional d6.

5331
03:28:47.798 --> 03:28:48.838
TALIESIN: Then double that.

5332
03:28:48.838 --> 03:28:50.069
ASHLEY: Should I have done that for the last one, too?

5333
03:28:50.069 --> 03:28:51.318
TRAVIS: You just add it, you don't double it.

5334
03:28:51.318 --> 03:28:52.984
MATT and ASHLEY: Only for the critical.

5335
03:28:52.984 --> 03:28:54.659
MATT: Yes. Roll one more d6.

5336
03:28:54.659 --> 03:28:56.942
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5337
03:28:56.942 --> 03:29:00.118
Okay, an additional four.

5338
03:29:00.118 --> 03:29:00.951
MATT: All righty, you got it.

5339
03:29:00.951 --> 03:29:01.923
TALIESIN: Is that doubled or is that just--?

5340
03:29:01.923 --> 03:29:04.673
MATT: No, it's just in addition to it.

5341
03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:08.883
ASHLEY and MATT: Second hit.

5342
03:29:08.883 --> 03:29:10.007
MATT: The first one strikes

5343
03:29:10.007 --> 03:29:11.506
and after the blow you took to the shoulder,

5344
03:29:11.506 --> 03:29:14.131
you reach up in the blade jams you,

5345
03:29:14.131 --> 03:29:15.918
you jam it up into his stomach and sternum

5346
03:29:15.918 --> 03:29:16.998
and it cuts through the armor

5347
03:29:16.998 --> 03:29:18.550
and goes a few inches into the torso.

5348
03:29:18.550 --> 03:29:19.558
He's like, "Ugh!"

5349
03:29:19.558 --> 03:29:20.391
ASHLEY: Can I keep it there?

5350
03:29:20.391 --> 03:29:22.326
MATT: Yeah, and you just push it harder for the next hit.

5351
03:29:22.326 --> 03:29:23.243
ASHLEY: 13.

5352
03:29:26.742 --> 03:29:28.200
MATT: All right,

5353
03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:31.402
so you push in a few more inches.

5354
03:29:31.402 --> 03:29:33.414
He spits blood down his chin,

5355
03:29:33.414 --> 03:29:35.330
down the front of the armor, across the blade.

5356
03:29:35.330 --> 03:29:36.854
He's looking really bad.

5357
03:29:36.854 --> 03:29:38.499
ASHLEY: Fuck yes.

5358
03:29:38.499 --> 03:29:40.692
LIAM: God, he was such a heavy-hitter.

5359
03:29:40.692 --> 03:29:42.425
ASHLEY: Okay.

5360
03:29:43.650 --> 03:29:46.310
I can't move, I attacked.

5361
03:29:46.310 --> 03:29:48.297
Do I get a bonus action?

5362
03:29:48.297 --> 03:29:49.520
No, that was--

5363
03:29:49.520 --> 03:29:50.854
MATT: You don't have much to spend on it right now.

5364
03:29:50.854 --> 03:29:52.035
ASHLEY: I was just going to see

5365
03:29:52.035 --> 03:29:53.318
if I could just hold him down.

5366
03:29:53.318 --> 03:29:54.166
MATT: As you're pushing the blade in,

5367
03:29:54.166 --> 03:29:58.107
he's like, "Orphan Maker,

5368
03:29:58.107 --> 03:29:59.882
"I've heard of you."

5369
03:30:02.306 --> 03:30:04.730
(yelling)

5370
03:30:04.730 --> 03:30:06.201
LIAM: Blade on bone.

5371
03:30:06.201 --> 03:30:07.218
MATT: Jester, you're up.

5372
03:30:07.218 --> 03:30:09.310
LAURA: Okay. This is stupid.

5373
03:30:09.310 --> 03:30:14.054
I'm going to cast fucking Locate Object again,

5374
03:30:14.054 --> 03:30:15.734
but this time I'm not going to do it on the book.

5375
03:30:15.734 --> 03:30:19.478
I'm going to do it on that scarf that I saw the drow wearing

5376
03:30:19.478 --> 03:30:21.297
when they walked in the door.

5377
03:30:21.297 --> 03:30:22.662
MATT: Okay.

5378
03:30:22.662 --> 03:30:26.467
You go ahead and take on the persona of the drow

5379
03:30:26.467 --> 03:30:27.300
that walked in.

5380
03:30:27.300 --> 03:30:28.133
LAURA: No, no, no, no.

5381
03:30:28.133 --> 03:30:30.486
MATT: Locate, I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

5382
03:30:30.486 --> 03:30:32.374
LAURA: I'm trying to locate, yeah.

5383
03:30:32.374 --> 03:30:34.023
TRAVIS: Although we might do that later.

5384
03:30:34.023 --> 03:30:34.980
LAURA: Yes.

5385
03:30:34.980 --> 03:30:37.926
TALIESIN: Where did I leave that scarf?

5386
03:30:37.926 --> 03:30:39.634
LIAM: Locate Scarf.

5387
03:30:39.634 --> 03:30:42.082
MARISHA: I cast Locate Scarf.

5388
03:30:42.082 --> 03:30:43.290
TALIESIN: Locate Neckwear.

5389
03:30:43.290 --> 03:30:45.764
LAURA: If I saw it up close within 30 feet--

5390
03:30:45.764 --> 03:30:46.772
MATT: Wait, what level is this?

5391
03:30:46.772 --> 03:30:48.806
LAURA: This is 2nd-level.

5392
03:30:48.806 --> 03:30:50.003
MATT: Oh, Locate Object.

5393
03:30:50.003 --> 03:30:52.054
LAURA: Yes, if I saw it within 30 feet,

5394
03:30:52.054 --> 03:30:53.142
I can find it exactly.

5395
03:30:53.142 --> 03:30:54.598
But I wasn't within 30 feet.

5396
03:30:54.598 --> 03:30:55.431
MATT: Correct.

5397
03:30:55.431 --> 03:30:59.926
LAURA: I can find the nearest thing like it that I saw.

5398
03:30:59.926 --> 03:31:03.151
MATT: Strangely, picks up nothing.

5399
03:31:05.862 --> 03:31:06.695
TRAVIS: Because it wasn't real.

5400
03:31:06.695 --> 03:31:09.295
LAURA: It was a fucking disguise.

5401
03:31:09.295 --> 03:31:10.774
ASHLEY: Fuck.

5402
03:31:10.774 --> 03:31:13.357
TRAVIS: Or he's just fucking way out.

5403
03:31:14.315 --> 03:31:16.232
LAURA: I bet it's a disguise.

5404
03:31:17.301 --> 03:31:18.516
Or he bamfed.

5405
03:31:18.516 --> 03:31:20.295
MATT: That's your action.

5406
03:31:20.295 --> 03:31:23.032
TRAVIS: Because how far out is that?

5407
03:31:23.032 --> 03:31:23.998
LAURA: I'm going to go--

5408
03:31:23.998 --> 03:31:26.383
SAM: I think 1,000 feet.

5409
03:31:26.383 --> 03:31:28.628
MARISHA: We still have the fabric swatch.

5410
03:31:28.628 --> 03:31:30.628
Scrying takes a minute right?

5411
03:31:30.628 --> 03:31:31.461
LAURA: Yeah, it takes ten minutes.

5412
03:31:31.461 --> 03:31:33.739
I'm going to go back in the building

5413
03:31:33.739 --> 03:31:37.192
and I'm going to go through the window that's open.

5414
03:31:37.192 --> 03:31:38.025
MATT: Okay.

5415
03:31:39.433 --> 03:31:41.046
You climb back through

5416
03:31:41.046 --> 03:31:42.150
and with the last of your movement,

5417
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:43.270
you get inside the storage room.

5418
03:31:43.270 --> 03:31:44.103
LAURA: Yeah.

5419
03:31:44.103 --> 03:31:45.315
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go, Jester.

5420
03:31:45.315 --> 03:31:46.732
Fjord, you're up.

5421
03:31:50.273 --> 03:31:53.828
TRAVIS: How far away are they to Aurora?

5422
03:31:53.828 --> 03:31:54.919
MATT: Aurora Watch,

5423
03:31:54.919 --> 03:31:57.749
which are the main guard and military of

5424
03:31:57.749 --> 03:31:58.582
the Kryn Dynasty.

5425
03:31:58.582 --> 03:32:02.780
They are about 100 feet from you this direction.

5426
03:32:02.780 --> 03:32:04.096
TRAVIS: Okay.

5427
03:32:04.934 --> 03:32:08.791
I will calmly start walking towards them

5428
03:32:08.791 --> 03:32:12.406
with a very low hand at my side

5429
03:32:12.406 --> 03:32:14.228
gesturing them to come forward,

5430
03:32:14.228 --> 03:32:16.725
but in as sly a manner as I can,

5431
03:32:16.725 --> 03:32:19.334
like I'm trying to keep a low profile

5432
03:32:19.334 --> 03:32:22.406
to anyone else that might now be watching besides them.

5433
03:32:22.406 --> 03:32:23.239
MATT: Okay.

5434
03:32:23.239 --> 03:32:26.230
TRAVIS: I will wait till they reach me

5435
03:32:26.230 --> 03:32:28.374
to interact with them.

5436
03:32:28.374 --> 03:32:30.453
Can I hold my speech, my talk?

5437
03:32:30.453 --> 03:32:31.286
MATT: I'll say sure, as an action,

5438
03:32:31.286 --> 03:32:34.619
if they approach close enough, you can do that.

5439
03:32:34.619 --> 03:32:36.806
Okay, that finishes your go, Fjord.

5440
03:32:36.806 --> 03:32:39.473
We're at the top of the round. Beau, you're up.

5441
03:32:40.597 --> 03:32:44.764
MARISHA: I wander back,

5442
03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:51.318
but as I walk back,

5443
03:32:51.318 --> 03:32:55.878
I want to like look for any stray movements,

5444
03:32:55.878 --> 03:32:59.578
any sounds, any footprints in dirt

5445
03:32:59.578 --> 03:33:01.782
that might be walking by,

5446
03:33:01.782 --> 03:33:03.334
signs of an invisible person

5447
03:33:03.334 --> 03:33:05.158
that might be wandering.

5448
03:33:05.158 --> 03:33:07.825
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

5449
03:33:08.710 --> 03:33:09.606
Actually no, this would be tracks.

5450
03:33:09.606 --> 03:33:10.694
This would be survival.

5451
03:33:10.694 --> 03:33:11.611
MARISHA: Survival.

5452
03:33:12.785 --> 03:33:14.202
No investigation?

5453
03:33:18.901 --> 03:33:19.926
Nine.

5454
03:33:19.926 --> 03:33:20.759
MATT: Nine.

5455
03:33:20.759 --> 03:33:22.310
All right, you spend your round looking around.

5456
03:33:22.310 --> 03:33:24.022
There's plenty of footfalls everywhere,

5457
03:33:24.022 --> 03:33:25.381
there's foot traffic through here,

5458
03:33:25.381 --> 03:33:26.982
a lot of all different sizes.

5459
03:33:26.982 --> 03:33:27.815
You're unable to really ascertain

5460
03:33:27.815 --> 03:33:29.782
whatever is the most fresh and seems to be--

5461
03:33:29.782 --> 03:33:32.334
MARISHA: But no, I mean I'm looking for

5462
03:33:32.334 --> 03:33:36.502
like movement of an invisible person potentially.

5463
03:33:36.502 --> 03:33:37.494
MATT: Oh, that would be perception.

5464
03:33:37.494 --> 03:33:38.646
So whatever that roll was,

5465
03:33:38.646 --> 03:33:40.102
consider that your perception roll.

5466
03:33:40.102 --> 03:33:41.654
MARISHA: Same garbage.

5467
03:33:41.654 --> 03:33:44.550
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately, nothing.

5468
03:33:44.550 --> 03:33:47.000
That finishes Beau's go. Caduceus.

5469
03:33:47.909 --> 03:33:50.134
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

5470
03:33:50.134 --> 03:33:51.187
yeah, this has gone on long enough,

5471
03:33:51.187 --> 03:33:54.354
I'm going to do one more shot

5472
03:33:54.354 --> 03:33:57.574
just to see if I can knock this this guy on his butt.

5473
03:33:58.566 --> 03:34:01.028
One more Sacred Flame.

5474
03:34:01.028 --> 03:34:03.031
MATT: All right.

5475
03:34:03.031 --> 03:34:06.781
Ooh, natural 18 plus two, 20.

5476
03:34:06.781 --> 03:34:08.437
Minus four, 16.

5477
03:34:08.437 --> 03:34:09.510
TALIESIN: Yep, that hits.

5478
03:34:09.510 --> 03:34:10.982
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: Here we go.

5479
03:34:10.982 --> 03:34:11.815
MATT: Your DC's 17?

5480
03:34:11.815 --> 03:34:12.648
TALIESIN: DC's 17.

5481
03:34:12.648 --> 03:34:13.731
MATT: Yeah.

5482
03:34:13.731 --> 03:34:15.972
Bane came through again.

5483
03:34:15.972 --> 03:34:18.347
TALIESIN: Oh wow, that's rough.

5484
03:34:18.347 --> 03:34:22.774
That's that's 18 points of radiant damage.

5485
03:34:22.774 --> 03:34:25.607
MATT: How do you want to do this?

5486
03:34:25.607 --> 03:34:27.894
TALIESIN: I'm just getting a little tired of all this,

5487
03:34:27.894 --> 03:34:28.822
I see it's going--

5488
03:34:28.822 --> 03:34:30.308
MATT: The last thing you see is Yasha with her

5489
03:34:30.308 --> 03:34:34.335
Magician's Judge partway into the torso of this

5490
03:34:34.335 --> 03:34:37.155
hobgoblin and the last thing you hear

5491
03:34:37.155 --> 03:34:38.598
like faintly through the glass is like,

5492
03:34:38.598 --> 03:34:40.756
"You're a legend."

5493
03:34:42.102 --> 03:34:43.269
TALIESIN: And on fire.

5494
03:34:45.713 --> 03:34:47.630
MATT: Just as he burns,

5495
03:34:49.494 --> 03:34:50.630
he burns, there's the moment of pain

5496
03:34:50.630 --> 03:34:53.174
and just looks you in the eyes and grins

5497
03:34:53.174 --> 03:34:57.011
and he begins to smolder and fall to his knees.

5498
03:34:57.011 --> 03:34:59.011
TALIESIN: Sleep.
MATT: Snap his neck,

5499
03:34:59.955 --> 03:35:01.538
pull the blade out.

5500
03:35:03.235 --> 03:35:04.454
TALIESIN: Did you just kill?

5501
03:35:04.454 --> 03:35:05.890
I'm going to run in immediately.

5502
03:35:05.890 --> 03:35:07.890
We need alive, we need--

5503
03:35:09.611 --> 03:35:11.235
MATT: He's very dead.

5504
03:35:11.235 --> 03:35:12.068
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

5505
03:35:12.068 --> 03:35:13.334
LIAM: We got a goblin though, right?

5506
03:35:13.334 --> 03:35:16.693
TALIESIN: She's not going to know anything.

5507
03:35:16.693 --> 03:35:19.943
LAURA: Maruo might've escaped in all of this.

5508
03:35:21.084 --> 03:35:21.917
TALIESIN: That's weird.

5509
03:35:21.917 --> 03:35:23.722
MATT: At this moment,

5510
03:35:23.722 --> 03:35:25.350
it's quiet in the room,

5511
03:35:25.350 --> 03:35:28.670
there's now the smell of burned hair and flesh.

5512
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:30.486
The hobgoblin is dead,

5513
03:35:30.486 --> 03:35:31.830
charred on the ground,

5514
03:35:31.830 --> 03:35:34.163
blood scattered on the wood.

5515
03:35:35.091 --> 03:35:36.911
MARISHA: I crawl back in through the window.

5516
03:35:36.911 --> 03:35:39.348
TALIESIN: Can I try and--

5517
03:35:39.348 --> 03:35:40.660
MATT: If you have Revivify.

5518
03:35:40.660 --> 03:35:42.143
TALIESIN: Oh man.

5519
03:35:42.143 --> 03:35:43.905
ASHLEY: Fuck.

5520
03:35:43.905 --> 03:35:44.852
SAM: We can talk to the dead body.

5521
03:35:44.852 --> 03:35:45.812
LAURA: We can talk to the dead body.

5522
03:35:45.812 --> 03:35:47.908
TALIESIN: There's things you can,

5523
03:35:47.908 --> 03:35:51.156
talk to the dead is only so helpful.

5524
03:35:51.156 --> 03:35:52.820
TRAVIS: Right, they don't have to tell you.

5525
03:35:52.820 --> 03:35:55.585
MATT: Anyway, you guys enter back into the building,

5526
03:35:55.585 --> 03:35:57.659
climb through and look inside.

5527
03:35:57.659 --> 03:36:01.097
LAURA: Should we move the dead scout in the back?

5528
03:36:01.097 --> 03:36:01.930
TRAVIS: The dragonborn?

5529
03:36:01.930 --> 03:36:03.019
LAURA: Yeah, we should move it inside.

5530
03:36:03.019 --> 03:36:04.734
LIAM: Well, that's what-- the

5531
03:36:04.734 --> 03:36:06.235
Cat's Ire carried it to the back

5532
03:36:06.235 --> 03:36:08.491
so it could dumped it through a window or--

5533
03:36:08.491 --> 03:36:10.596
LAURA: Yeah, let's get it through the window.

5534
03:36:10.596 --> 03:36:12.283
MATT: Cat's Ire pulls over--

5535
03:36:12.283 --> 03:36:14.494
LIAM: Right, helps get it through and then evaporates.

5536
03:36:14.494 --> 03:36:15.390
MATT: Right. So Caleb, you come to the front,

5537
03:36:15.390 --> 03:36:16.223
look through the window

5538
03:36:16.223 --> 03:36:17.739
and help guide her over and bring it inside

5539
03:36:17.739 --> 03:36:20.344
the body just looks rough.

5540
03:36:20.344 --> 03:36:23.741
LAURA: I immediately go into the corner of this room,

5541
03:36:23.741 --> 03:36:25.807
sit down and start scrying.

5542
03:36:25.807 --> 03:36:26.640
MATT: Okay.

5543
03:36:29.466 --> 03:36:30.828
MARISHA: I pat down the dragonborn,

5544
03:36:30.828 --> 03:36:32.478
start looking for anything.

5545
03:36:32.478 --> 03:36:35.225
MATT: Okay, well, while you guys are doing this--

5546
03:36:35.225 --> 03:36:37.851
TALIESIN: I can tell there's no saving this

5547
03:36:37.851 --> 03:36:38.684
at this point.
MATT: Outside of the Revivify,

5548
03:36:38.684 --> 03:36:39.517
yeah.

5549
03:36:39.517 --> 03:36:41.115
Between the blade through the chest,

5550
03:36:41.115 --> 03:36:42.459
the Sacred Flame,

5551
03:36:42.459 --> 03:36:45.481
which, unless you intended to be non-lethal--

5552
03:36:45.481 --> 03:36:47.482
TALIESIN: I did intend to be non-lethal, but--

5553
03:36:47.482 --> 03:36:49.049
MATT: But at the point that he was falling unconscious.

5554
03:36:49.049 --> 03:36:50.007
TALIESIN: I know.

5555
03:36:50.007 --> 03:36:54.442
I'm going to go behind the counter very gently.

5556
03:36:54.442 --> 03:36:57.608
MATT: Maruo is right there clutching a crossbow

5557
03:36:57.608 --> 03:36:59.132
and is like (scared panting).

5558
03:36:59.132 --> 03:37:01.809
TALIESIN: I'm going to do Detect Magic really quickly.

5559
03:37:01.809 --> 03:37:04.107
MATT: Yeah, and it's in the same corner.

5560
03:37:04.107 --> 03:37:04.940
TALIESIN: It's in the same corner.

5561
03:37:04.940 --> 03:37:06.779
It's a wand right if, I recall?

5562
03:37:06.779 --> 03:37:09.867
MATT: No, it's just a magical aura.

5563
03:37:09.867 --> 03:37:11.270
TALIESIN: I'm going to go poke that thing.

5564
03:37:11.270 --> 03:37:12.347
LAURA: It's the fucking bugbear.

5565
03:37:12.347 --> 03:37:14.715
MATT: Okay, you poke and you feel a body there

5566
03:37:14.715 --> 03:37:16.360
and a hand goes and grabs.

5567
03:37:16.360 --> 03:37:18.451
TALIESIN: Hey.

5568
03:37:18.451 --> 03:37:19.739
MATT: "Hey."

5569
03:37:19.739 --> 03:37:21.463
TALIESIN: This doesn't have to go down badly

5570
03:37:21.463 --> 03:37:24.104
if you don't want it to.

5571
03:37:24.104 --> 03:37:26.347
MATT: "We don't want any part of this."

5572
03:37:26.347 --> 03:37:28.762
TALIESIN: I'm cool with that.

5573
03:37:28.762 --> 03:37:31.404
Do you mind dropping the invisibility?

5574
03:37:31.404 --> 03:37:32.554
I'm saying this out loud,

5575
03:37:32.554 --> 03:37:36.759
let's all just cool our jets for a second.

5576
03:37:36.759 --> 03:37:39.083
MATT: Maruo fiddles with something

5577
03:37:39.083 --> 03:37:43.478
and you watch the bugbear appear.

5578
03:37:43.478 --> 03:37:45.359
It's a big muscular one.

5579
03:37:45.359 --> 03:37:46.635
TALIESIN: Everyone's a little on edge

5580
03:37:46.635 --> 03:37:48.891
and this definitely didn't go the way we wanted.

5581
03:37:48.891 --> 03:37:50.811
Best to sit down and just chill out for.

5582
03:37:50.811 --> 03:37:52.385
MATT: "Yeah, I can do that."

5583
03:37:52.385 --> 03:37:54.987
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, you're fine, you're fine.

5584
03:37:54.987 --> 03:37:56.835
MARISHA: Can we shut the doors and windows?

5585
03:37:56.835 --> 03:37:57.753
MATT: While this is happening,

5586
03:37:57.753 --> 03:38:00.603
the two guards approach you.

5587
03:38:01.848 --> 03:38:03.211
"What is the business here?

5588
03:38:03.211 --> 03:38:04.475
"We were called over, there was--"

5589
03:38:04.475 --> 03:38:06.379
TRAVIS: Keep your voice down.

5590
03:38:06.379 --> 03:38:07.212
MATT: "Who are you?"

5591
03:38:07.212 --> 03:38:08.187
TRAVIS: By the light of the Luxon,

5592
03:38:08.187 --> 03:38:11.938
whatever you do, keep a calm demeanor.

5593
03:38:11.938 --> 03:38:15.387
There is a covert ambush operation being carried out here

5594
03:38:15.387 --> 03:38:17.403
by order of the Bright Queen.

5595
03:38:17.403 --> 03:38:19.451
I need you to return to what you were doing.

5596
03:38:19.451 --> 03:38:23.896
If you need to stay near, hide yourselves, act natural.

5597
03:38:23.896 --> 03:38:27.003
That fellow that got away almost ruined this entire thing.

5598
03:38:27.003 --> 03:38:29.019
Please, you do not want to ruin this.

5599
03:38:29.019 --> 03:38:31.102
MATT: Make a deception check.

5600
03:38:32.411 --> 03:38:33.244
TRAVIS: 18.

5601
03:38:33.244 --> 03:38:34.077
MATT: 18.

5602
03:38:34.077 --> 03:38:36.123
They both look at each other.

5603
03:38:36.123 --> 03:38:37.456
"Right, apologies,

5604
03:38:38.644 --> 03:38:40.523
"good luck."

5605
03:38:40.523 --> 03:38:42.987
They both just turn around.
TRAVIS: May the light be with you.

5606
03:38:42.987 --> 03:38:43.963
MATT: "Light be with you,"

5607
03:38:43.963 --> 03:38:45.880
leave the opposite way.

5608
03:38:46.923 --> 03:38:51.006
Having a face man fucking saves so much trouble.

5609
03:38:54.011 --> 03:38:57.060
TRAVIS: I'll go back in and shut the door behind me.

5610
03:38:57.060 --> 03:38:59.608
TALIESIN: Locate Creature, if that's even possible.

5611
03:38:59.608 --> 03:39:00.894
MATT: Sure, you want to Locate Creature.

5612
03:39:00.894 --> 03:39:02.891
TRAVIS: The face off.

5613
03:39:02.891 --> 03:39:05.058
TALIESIN: Our friend who got away.

5614
03:39:06.811 --> 03:39:08.894
MATT: Creature, 4th-level.

5615
03:39:11.920 --> 03:39:15.253
Okay, so you're sitting down to cast Scry.

5616
03:39:30.692 --> 03:39:31.655
SAM: Silence.

5617
03:39:31.655 --> 03:39:32.988
MATT: You do sense it.

5618
03:39:34.177 --> 03:39:36.075
It is towards the north

5619
03:39:36.075 --> 03:39:37.033
and it is moving.

5620
03:39:37.033 --> 03:39:37.883
It is a ways away.

5621
03:39:37.883 --> 03:39:38.794
You'd only know the direction.

5622
03:39:38.794 --> 03:39:40.202
You don't know how far it is or where they are.

5623
03:39:40.202 --> 03:39:41.883
You just know the general direction of where they are.

5624
03:39:41.883 --> 03:39:42.841
TALIESIN: They're moving north.

5625
03:39:42.841 --> 03:39:44.522
TRAVIS: Who, the person we were trying?

5626
03:39:44.522 --> 03:39:45.971
TALIESIN: Yep. Right now.

5627
03:39:45.971 --> 03:39:47.499
SAM: Like how many feet?

5628
03:39:47.499 --> 03:39:48.332
TALIESIN: Don't know.

5629
03:39:48.332 --> 03:39:49.165
MATT: You don't know, just the direction.

5630
03:39:49.165 --> 03:39:49.998
TALIESIN: Moving north.
ASHLEY: Try and pat down

5631
03:39:49.998 --> 03:39:52.171
what's left of this hobgoblin's body

5632
03:39:52.171 --> 03:39:54.187
to see if I can find anything on him.

5633
03:39:54.187 --> 03:39:57.275
MATT: Yeah, make an investigation check.

5634
03:39:57.275 --> 03:40:00.683
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb, maybe do we want to send a creature,

5635
03:40:00.683 --> 03:40:02.265
a flying creature maybe?
ASHLEY: 11.

5636
03:40:02.265 --> 03:40:03.098
MATT: 11, okay.

5637
03:40:03.098 --> 03:40:04.299
The armor's ruined.

5638
03:40:04.299 --> 03:40:07.258
The plate is largely destroyed.

5639
03:40:07.258 --> 03:40:12.258
You do pull off about 365 gold pieces,

5640
03:40:12.571 --> 03:40:14.304
12 silver.

5641
03:40:18.268 --> 03:40:20.345
The blade is nice.

5642
03:40:20.345 --> 03:40:21.178
ASHLEY: Say again?

5643
03:40:21.178 --> 03:40:23.401
MATT: The greatsword that he had is a fairly nice weapon.

5644
03:40:23.401 --> 03:40:27.109
It looks well made, yeah.

5645
03:40:27.952 --> 03:40:28.906
ASHLEY: Okay.

5646
03:40:28.906 --> 03:40:31.730
MARISHA: Did I find anything on the dragonborn?

5647
03:40:31.730 --> 03:40:34.232
Correspondence, papers?

5648
03:40:34.232 --> 03:40:36.757
MATT: Actually, that's a valid point too, Caduceus,

5649
03:40:36.757 --> 03:40:39.418
you would've also felt a magical essence

5650
03:40:39.418 --> 03:40:40.987
when you cast Detect Magic

5651
03:40:40.987 --> 03:40:43.738
over in the chamber near were your friends were.

5652
03:40:43.738 --> 03:40:46.058
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll let everyone know.

5653
03:40:46.058 --> 03:40:46.891
We should check out,

5654
03:40:46.891 --> 03:40:48.090
I'm getting a vibe from the other,

5655
03:40:48.090 --> 03:40:49.146
from that room over there.

5656
03:40:49.146 --> 03:40:50.346
LAURA: The one that I'm scrying in?

5657
03:40:50.346 --> 03:40:52.730
MATT: No, the one that Yasha was,

5658
03:40:52.730 --> 03:40:54.136
specifically the greatsword.

5659
03:40:54.136 --> 03:40:57.298
TALIESIN: Oh, greatsword is magical.

5660
03:40:57.298 --> 03:40:59.218
Be careful of it.

5661
03:40:59.218 --> 03:41:00.426
MARISHA: Dragonborn.

5662
03:41:00.426 --> 03:41:03.509
MATT: Right, roll an investigation check.

5663
03:41:06.058 --> 03:41:07.739
MARISHA: What the fuck?!

5664
03:41:07.739 --> 03:41:08.572
TALIESIN: I get an hour.

5665
03:41:08.572 --> 03:41:09.405
MARISHA: Nine.

5666
03:41:09.405 --> 03:41:10.988
MATT: You do. Concentration for an hour.

5667
03:41:11.867 --> 03:41:12.960
Nine, okay.

5668
03:41:12.960 --> 03:41:13.793
On the dragonborn,

5669
03:41:13.793 --> 03:41:15.159
you find the gold of coin,

5670
03:41:15.159 --> 03:41:18.586
the pouch of coins that was given to her

5671
03:41:18.586 --> 03:41:21.988
by this figure upstairs.

5672
03:41:21.988 --> 03:41:22.954
You grab that.

5673
03:41:22.954 --> 03:41:26.310
That one is 50 platinum.

5674
03:41:26.310 --> 03:41:29.210
TRAVIS: Fuck, okay.

5675
03:41:29.210 --> 03:41:31.194
SAM: If you know that this creature is nearby,

5676
03:41:31.194 --> 03:41:33.208
we should go look for it.

5677
03:41:33.208 --> 03:41:35.291
LAURA: Has it been ten minutes?

5678
03:41:36.375 --> 03:41:37.683
MATT: If you want to wait,

5679
03:41:37.683 --> 03:41:39.512
you can wait until ten minutes go by.

5680
03:41:39.512 --> 03:41:40.858
LAURA: I'm just scrying, I'm trying to scry.

5681
03:41:40.858 --> 03:41:43.400
It takes ten minutes to scry.

5682
03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:44.838
On the blonde guy.

5683
03:41:44.838 --> 03:41:46.090
SAM: The blonde guy.

5684
03:41:46.090 --> 03:41:48.442
What about the one who was here, the drow?

5685
03:41:48.442 --> 03:41:49.767
LIAM: In the interim, I would've--

5686
03:41:49.767 --> 03:41:51.882
LAURA: He's got Locate Creature on that one.

5687
03:41:51.882 --> 03:41:53.321
SAM: I know, let's go get him.

5688
03:41:53.321 --> 03:41:56.186
MATT: The blonde guy does not make his save.

5689
03:41:56.186 --> 03:41:57.413
TRAVIS: Does not make his save.

5690
03:41:57.413 --> 03:41:59.722
LAURA: As you're concentrating and focusing,

5691
03:41:59.722 --> 03:42:02.389
your vision carries in once more

5692
03:42:03.321 --> 03:42:05.431
and for a brief second you see the hooded face,

5693
03:42:05.431 --> 03:42:09.514
the smile, the lower half of the Traveler's grin,

5694
03:42:10.378 --> 03:42:11.306
look at you and--

5695
03:42:11.306 --> 03:42:12.514
LAURA: Help me.

5696
03:42:12.514 --> 03:42:13.672
MATT: "I will."

5697
03:42:13.672 --> 03:42:16.555
Turns your head this way and as your head swivels,

5698
03:42:16.555 --> 03:42:19.114
there's a blur and suddenly you're inside the chamber

5699
03:42:19.114 --> 03:42:21.226
where you first saw him.

5700
03:42:21.226 --> 03:42:22.642
The room where he was taking notes

5701
03:42:22.642 --> 03:42:25.705
and is back to in the process

5702
03:42:25.705 --> 03:42:27.402
of looking through the same book,

5703
03:42:27.402 --> 03:42:31.536
making more notes in the margins and researching.

5704
03:42:31.536 --> 03:42:32.769
TRAVIS: I don't think he ever left.

5705
03:42:33.611 --> 03:42:36.378
LAURA: Maybe he's not the one meeting.

5706
03:42:36.378 --> 03:42:38.396
TALIESIN: What if the meeting is later?

5707
03:42:38.396 --> 03:42:42.063
MARISHA: He was meeting the guy that we scared him off.

5708
03:42:43.698 --> 03:42:45.040
SAM: He's in the Empire right now.

5709
03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:47.338
LAURA: Do I see anything that he's writing?

5710
03:42:47.338 --> 03:42:49.131
MATT: Make a perception check.
ASHLEY: Do we know that for sure?

5711
03:42:49.131 --> 03:42:50.581
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.

5712
03:42:50.581 --> 03:42:51.747
MARISHA: It's two different areas.

5713
03:42:52.649 --> 03:42:53.482
LIAM: Let her do her shit.

5714
03:42:55.846 --> 03:42:56.946
LAURA: 23.

5715
03:42:56.946 --> 03:42:58.271
MATT: 23.

5716
03:42:59.147 --> 03:43:00.263
TRAVIS: That helps.

5717
03:43:00.263 --> 03:43:02.071
Remember the last time you could barely see anything.

5718
03:43:08.590 --> 03:43:12.274
MATT: Do you understand Celestial as a language?

5719
03:43:12.274 --> 03:43:13.194
LAURA: No.

5720
03:43:13.194 --> 03:43:15.857
MATT: Then you cannot understand anything that he's writing.

5721
03:43:15.857 --> 03:43:16.857
LAURA: Celestial.

5722
03:43:18.644 --> 03:43:20.346
TRAVIS: Anybody got Celestial in their wheelhouse?

5723
03:43:20.346 --> 03:43:21.429
SAM: She's an artist.

5724
03:43:21.429 --> 03:43:24.666
Maybe she could copy a letter or two.

5725
03:43:24.666 --> 03:43:26.682
LIAM: Yeah, if you can write or draw.

5726
03:43:26.682 --> 03:43:27.953
TALIESIN: That's hard to figure out.

5727
03:43:27.953 --> 03:43:29.834
It's hard to fake a language.

5728
03:43:29.834 --> 03:43:32.730
LAURA: I'll try to remember symbols, that's all I can do.

5729
03:43:32.730 --> 03:43:34.455
MATT: Okay, all right.

5730
03:43:34.455 --> 03:43:35.735
While you're focusing on it,

5731
03:43:35.735 --> 03:43:37.578
like just concentrating in the direction,

5732
03:43:37.578 --> 03:43:40.409
the direction is moving slightly, shifting.

5733
03:43:40.409 --> 03:43:41.242
TALIESIN: They are moving still.

5734
03:43:41.242 --> 03:43:42.813
They are still in movement.

5735
03:43:42.813 --> 03:43:44.216
MATT: Gone.

5736
03:43:44.216 --> 03:43:46.186
TALIESIN: And they're out of range.

5737
03:43:46.186 --> 03:43:47.706
SAM: What's the range?

5738
03:43:47.706 --> 03:43:50.394
TALIESIN: Give or take 1,000.
MATT: Heading northward.

5739
03:43:50.394 --> 03:43:51.959
TALIESIN: 1,000 odd feet.

5740
03:43:51.959 --> 03:43:54.846
They're moving northward, though.

5741
03:43:54.846 --> 03:43:57.050
MARISHA: If we get back within range,

5742
03:43:57.050 --> 03:44:00.086
can you continue to to find them and track them?

5743
03:44:00.086 --> 03:44:01.514
TALIESIN: Is it a spell that picks up?

5744
03:44:01.514 --> 03:44:02.602
I feel like I would know that.

5745
03:44:02.602 --> 03:44:03.435
MATT: Yeah.

5746
03:44:03.435 --> 03:44:04.643
If you can get back within range.

5747
03:44:04.643 --> 03:44:05.749
MARISHA: Should we move?

5748
03:44:05.749 --> 03:44:07.082
I can move fast.

5749
03:44:08.896 --> 03:44:12.105
TRAVIS: You're going to close 1,000 feet?

5750
03:44:12.105 --> 03:44:14.755
MARISHA: I could if I had a horse. Oh wait.

5751
03:44:14.755 --> 03:44:16.661
TALIESIN: Can I tell what speed that they're moving?

5752
03:44:16.661 --> 03:44:18.111
LAURA: We have moorbounders.

5753
03:44:18.111 --> 03:44:21.290
TALIESIN: Can I tell if it's a fast speed or a slow speed?

5754
03:44:21.290 --> 03:44:25.079
MATT: It started slow and then it went quicker.

5755
03:44:25.079 --> 03:44:26.995
ASHLEY: Let's get on the moorbounders and run.

5756
03:44:26.995 --> 03:44:29.450
TRAVIS: It'll take, what, 20 minutes to get back

5757
03:44:29.450 --> 03:44:30.746
to where the moorbounders are?

5758
03:44:30.746 --> 03:44:31.978
MATT: Yeah, they're still in the house.

5759
03:44:31.978 --> 03:44:33.337
You have to backtrack southward

5760
03:44:33.337 --> 03:44:34.170
to where your house is.

5761
03:44:34.170 --> 03:44:35.003
TRAVIS: They're gone.

5762
03:44:35.003 --> 03:44:36.603
LIAM: We have no idea, they're gone.

5763
03:44:36.603 --> 03:44:39.168
TRAVIS: We should get questions out of these two.

5764
03:44:39.168 --> 03:44:41.162
TALIESIN: How much city is to the north?

5765
03:44:41.162 --> 03:44:41.998
MATT: Hmm?

5766
03:44:41.998 --> 03:44:44.488
TALIESIN: How much city is to the north?

5767
03:44:44.488 --> 03:44:49.305
MATT: Maybe another eighth of a mile,

5768
03:44:49.305 --> 03:44:50.888
like not much.

5769
03:44:50.888 --> 03:44:53.777
The Coronas doesn't go too far.

5770
03:44:53.777 --> 03:44:56.860
Judging the distance and the exit,

5771
03:44:57.823 --> 03:45:02.041
this figure left your range in the Ghostlands.

5772
03:45:02.041 --> 03:45:03.914
TALIESIN: They're heading towards the Ghostlands?

5773
03:45:03.914 --> 03:45:06.042
MATT: They're in the Ghostlands now, heading north.

5774
03:45:06.042 --> 03:45:07.758
They've left the city.

5775
03:45:07.758 --> 03:45:09.351
TALIESIN: Shit.

5776
03:45:09.351 --> 03:45:11.066
MARISHA: I'm down to be a runner

5777
03:45:11.066 --> 03:45:12.458
if we want to have some people stay here

5778
03:45:12.458 --> 03:45:14.740
and some people run.

5779
03:45:14.740 --> 03:45:17.706
LAURA: Fjord, you and I could stay and disguise ourselves

5780
03:45:17.706 --> 03:45:20.428
as the hobgoblin and the drow.

5781
03:45:20.428 --> 03:45:21.508
TRAVIS: We could.

5782
03:45:21.508 --> 03:45:24.408
In case there's another meeting.

5783
03:45:24.408 --> 03:45:25.946
LIAM: So we lock these two up?

5784
03:45:25.946 --> 03:45:28.330
Put manacles on one of them and tie up the other?

5785
03:45:28.330 --> 03:45:31.184
Tell the soldiers on trail through the Ghostlands

5786
03:45:31.184 --> 03:45:32.824
to catch somebody?

5787
03:45:32.824 --> 03:45:34.186
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we might leave them free

5788
03:45:34.186 --> 03:45:35.226
in case someone needs to come in

5789
03:45:35.226 --> 03:45:37.976
and see the shop owner unimpeded.

5790
03:45:39.018 --> 03:45:41.674
LAURA: Yeah, we're saying we stay here

5791
03:45:41.674 --> 03:45:43.287
as the people meeting.

5792
03:45:43.287 --> 03:45:44.536
We'll look just like them.

5793
03:45:44.536 --> 03:45:46.178
We don't need to be locked up at all.

5794
03:45:46.178 --> 03:45:49.994
LIAM: No, lock up these two, the real ones.

5795
03:45:49.994 --> 03:45:52.588
MATT: You're in the room with them.

5796
03:45:52.588 --> 03:45:55.224
"I'm just going to come out here and say

5797
03:45:55.224 --> 03:45:57.907
"that I have nothing to do with this."

5798
03:45:57.907 --> 03:45:59.127
TALIESIN: Not the time.

5799
03:45:59.127 --> 03:46:00.252
LAURA: I'm saying make us look like

5800
03:46:00.252 --> 03:46:02.266
the drow and the hobgoblin.

5801
03:46:02.266 --> 03:46:04.918
The goblin and the bugbear stay there,

5802
03:46:04.918 --> 03:46:06.939
they do what they do.

5803
03:46:06.939 --> 03:46:10.474
We turn in to the drow and the hobgoblin

5804
03:46:10.474 --> 03:46:11.866
and act like we are the people

5805
03:46:11.866 --> 03:46:14.631
that the blonde guy is meeting if he shows up

5806
03:46:14.631 --> 03:46:16.410
LIAM: Sure, will these two cooperate?

5807
03:46:16.410 --> 03:46:18.618
LAURA: Yeah, of course they will.

5808
03:46:18.618 --> 03:46:20.201
MATT: "I run a business."

5809
03:46:22.423 --> 03:46:24.106
ASHLEY: Did we check the upstairs?

5810
03:46:24.106 --> 03:46:26.330
SAM: No, let's go do it.

5811
03:46:26.330 --> 03:46:29.146
TALIESIN: We should just take a look around.

5812
03:46:29.146 --> 03:46:30.260
Your friend there,

5813
03:46:30.260 --> 03:46:33.442
and I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

5814
03:46:33.442 --> 03:46:35.183
MATT: "Ben."
TALIESIN: Hey, Ben.

5815
03:46:36.288 --> 03:46:38.863
What is it that you do?

5816
03:46:41.015 --> 03:46:42.440
MATT: "What the boss say."

5817
03:46:42.440 --> 03:46:43.806
TALIESIN: Okay.

5818
03:46:44.680 --> 03:46:46.313
MATT: "We don't get involved in business

5819
03:46:46.313 --> 03:46:47.738
"we're not supposed to.

5820
03:46:47.738 --> 03:46:50.106
"That looked a little more than I can handle."

5821
03:46:50.106 --> 03:46:54.442
TALIESIN: Can you explain to me what was just going on?

5822
03:46:54.442 --> 03:46:56.202
Like what was this meeting, do you know,

5823
03:46:56.202 --> 03:46:57.800
or is this like a community room?

5824
03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:00.055
MATT: "This happens every now and then."

5825
03:47:00.055 --> 03:47:01.055
Maruo's like,

5826
03:47:02.015 --> 03:47:04.298
"Some folks want a private place to meet,

5827
03:47:04.298 --> 03:47:05.450
"so they drop me some coin

5828
03:47:05.450 --> 03:47:08.087
"and I give them the upstairs."

5829
03:47:08.087 --> 03:47:11.001
TALIESIN: That's what I thought.

5830
03:47:11.001 --> 03:47:13.834
Have you seen these people before?

5831
03:47:14.824 --> 03:47:18.746
MATT: "Only once before, a few months back."

5832
03:47:18.746 --> 03:47:20.183
TALIESIN: Did they have a human with them?

5833
03:47:20.183 --> 03:47:21.498
MATT: "No."

5834
03:47:21.498 --> 03:47:22.729
TALIESIN: Just them, no other people?

5835
03:47:22.729 --> 03:47:23.729
MATT: "Same trio."

5836
03:47:24.858 --> 03:47:25.914
SAM: Are you fast?

5837
03:47:25.914 --> 03:47:26.954
TRAVIS: Not like that.

5838
03:47:26.954 --> 03:47:28.634
MARISHA: Not like I am, bud.

5839
03:47:28.634 --> 03:47:29.802
It's either that or I go along.

5840
03:47:29.802 --> 03:47:32.874
LIAM: I just scarfed my cat on Beauregard.

5841
03:47:32.874 --> 03:47:36.199
TALIESIN: You're also beat to heck right now.

5842
03:47:36.199 --> 03:47:37.357
ASHLEY: I'm pretty low.

5843
03:47:37.357 --> 03:47:38.490
SAM: I'm fast.

5844
03:47:38.490 --> 03:47:39.688
MARISHA: You want to come with me?

5845
03:47:39.688 --> 03:47:41.540
SAM: Sure.

5846
03:47:41.540 --> 03:47:43.418
TALIESIN: Take a few more minutes.

5847
03:47:43.418 --> 03:47:46.922
I'm going to run a quick Prayer of Healing.

5848
03:47:46.922 --> 03:47:48.666
Well, no, if you're running immediately,

5849
03:47:48.666 --> 03:47:50.416
I'm just going to do a--

5850
03:47:52.419 --> 03:47:53.479
They were moving

5851
03:47:53.479 --> 03:47:55.354
and then they moved faster.

5852
03:47:55.354 --> 03:47:58.862
So they're either flying or on a horse or whatever.

5853
03:47:58.862 --> 03:48:01.502
I don't know if you're going to catch up to that.

5854
03:48:01.502 --> 03:48:05.576
TALIESIN: On the way out, I'm going to burn my,

5855
03:48:05.576 --> 03:48:06.986
should I burn my spells?

5856
03:48:06.986 --> 03:48:08.215
Is it time to burn spells?

5857
03:48:08.215 --> 03:48:10.774
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: We're desperate.

5858
03:48:10.774 --> 03:48:12.041
MARISHA: I don't have any way to find them

5859
03:48:12.041 --> 03:48:13.544
unless I get there with a horse.

5860
03:48:13.544 --> 03:48:17.364
It's your Locate Creature that I would need.

5861
03:48:18.231 --> 03:48:19.064
Fuck.

5862
03:48:20.518 --> 03:48:22.057
ASHLEY: Does anyone want to check upstairs?

5863
03:48:22.057 --> 03:48:23.666
SAM: Yes, let's go.
LAURA: I could send them a message

5864
03:48:23.666 --> 03:48:25.479
and tell them to turn around.

5865
03:48:25.479 --> 03:48:27.114
MATT: You do have the figure.

5866
03:48:27.114 --> 03:48:27.947
You could send them a message

5867
03:48:27.947 --> 03:48:29.370
and just scry whatever you want to do.

5868
03:48:29.370 --> 03:48:30.855
You've seen the figure

5869
03:48:30.855 --> 03:48:32.234
so you know them.

5870
03:48:32.234 --> 03:48:35.484
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a few minutes to run a

5871
03:48:36.487 --> 03:48:39.937
Prayer of Healing on a bunch of people.

5872
03:48:39.937 --> 03:48:41.003
MARISHA: Thank you.

5873
03:48:41.003 --> 03:48:41.836
ASHLEY: Thank you.

5874
03:48:41.836 --> 03:48:43.850
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast it at level three

5875
03:48:43.850 --> 03:48:47.143
just to give everyone a little bit of a boost.

5876
03:48:47.143 --> 03:48:50.752
I'm going to just continue to talk to the

5877
03:48:50.752 --> 03:48:53.255
bugbear and see what's up with them.

5878
03:48:53.255 --> 03:48:54.430
Let's see, what is this?

5879
03:48:54.430 --> 03:48:55.613
MATT: "I'm just being honest.

5880
03:48:55.613 --> 03:48:56.784
"I know nothing.

5881
03:48:56.784 --> 03:48:59.450
"I'm just here to keep the boss safe."

5882
03:48:59.450 --> 03:49:01.018
TRAVIS: Yeah, but you keep an eye out

5883
03:49:01.018 --> 03:49:02.474
invisibly from the corner.

5884
03:49:02.474 --> 03:49:03.482
I think you need to tell us

5885
03:49:03.482 --> 03:49:07.050
everything you have seen or heard these people discuss.

5886
03:49:07.050 --> 03:49:08.586
MATT: "Well, I haven't heard them discuss anything.

5887
03:49:08.586 --> 03:49:09.850
"They come in here, drop coin

5888
03:49:09.850 --> 03:49:11.914
"and then talk upstairs."

5889
03:49:11.914 --> 03:49:14.426
TALIESIN: 17 points of healing to everyone who needs it.

5890
03:49:14.426 --> 03:49:15.259
ASHLEY: Oh, so good.

5891
03:49:15.259 --> 03:49:17.178
TRAVIS: So you're a bit of protection here for your boss?

5892
03:49:17.178 --> 03:49:18.011
MATT: "Yeah."

5893
03:49:18.011 --> 03:49:20.445
"Does a good job when people try and rough me up.

5894
03:49:20.445 --> 03:49:22.651
"Take out some coin.

5895
03:49:22.651 --> 03:49:25.884
"Surprises them from the corner, you know what I mean?"

5896
03:49:25.884 --> 03:49:28.158
LAURA: On the drow that's striding away.

5897
03:49:28.158 --> 03:49:29.402
SAM: You're going to send him a message?

5898
03:49:29.402 --> 03:49:30.735
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending.

5899
03:49:30.735 --> 03:49:32.510
MATT: All right.

5900
03:49:32.510 --> 03:49:34.124
LIAM: Let's go roll the upstairs.

5901
03:49:34.124 --> 03:49:34.957
TALIESIN: I'm going to also:

5902
03:49:34.957 --> 03:49:36.650
We're just going to take a look around.

5903
03:49:36.650 --> 03:49:37.753
We'll be back in a minute.

5904
03:49:37.753 --> 03:49:40.969
Just keep cool and

5905
03:49:42.319 --> 03:49:44.618
just be cool.

5906
03:49:44.618 --> 03:49:46.949
MATT: "All right, mister."

5907
03:49:46.949 --> 03:49:48.336
TALIESIN: Cool, man.

5908
03:49:48.336 --> 03:49:51.482
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending.

5909
03:49:51.482 --> 03:49:53.732
All I'm going to say is:

5910
03:49:55.846 --> 03:49:57.179
Eyes are on you.

5911
03:49:59.176 --> 03:50:00.809
You've left the rendezvous.

5912
03:50:00.809 --> 03:50:03.226
What happened to the mission?

5913
03:50:08.266 --> 03:50:11.594
MATT: Let me check something real fast.

5914
03:50:11.594 --> 03:50:14.496
TALIESIN: Power play. Power play.

5915
03:50:14.496 --> 03:50:16.496
ASHLEY: Power fucking play.

5916
03:50:18.746 --> 03:50:20.329
ASHLEY: Come on, come on.

5917
03:50:22.938 --> 03:50:23.771
Come on.

5918
03:50:27.658 --> 03:50:28.575
MATT: Responds,

5919
03:50:30.490 --> 03:50:32.007
"I know you,

5920
03:50:34.650 --> 03:50:39.650
"but I appreciate your attempt at deception.

5921
03:50:41.786 --> 03:50:44.561
"If you are intent on following,

5922
03:50:45.446 --> 03:50:46.671
"come north.

5923
03:50:55.484 --> 03:50:56.667
"Bring her."

5924
03:50:57.957 --> 03:51:00.465
TRAVIS: Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

5925
03:51:01.728 --> 03:51:03.815
MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

5926
03:51:03.815 --> 03:51:06.594
(yelling)

5927
03:51:06.594 --> 03:51:07.960
TALIESIN: Oh damn!

5928
03:51:07.960 --> 03:51:09.637
MATT: We'll pick up there next week.

5929
03:51:09.637 --> 03:51:11.338
TALIESIN: Hey, magic sword, guys.

5930
03:51:11.338 --> 03:51:12.617
TRAVIS: Orphan Maker.

5931
03:51:12.617 --> 03:51:13.650
LAURA: (Cockney accent) Hey, Orphan Maker,

5932
03:51:13.650 --> 03:51:14.808
what happened there,

5933
03:51:14.808 --> 03:51:15.849
Orphan Maker?

5934
03:51:15.849 --> 03:51:18.061
ASHLEY: (Cockney accent) Orphan Maker!

5935
03:51:18.061 --> 03:51:19.585
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

5936
03:51:19.585 --> 03:51:21.183
TALIESIN: Way to--
LIAM: Man.

5937
03:51:21.183 --> 03:51:22.016
ASHLEY: Oh boy.
LAURA: I tried.

5938
03:51:22.016 --> 03:51:23.099
TALIESIN: Way to bring the--

5939
03:51:23.099 --> 03:51:24.599
SAM: What does that mean?

5940
03:51:24.599 --> 03:51:26.778
MATT: That could've gone sideways quite a few ways.

5941
03:51:26.778 --> 03:51:28.313
SAM: It did go sideways!

5942
03:51:28.313 --> 03:51:30.426
TALIESIN: That went so fucking sideways.

5943
03:51:30.426 --> 03:51:31.898
MATT: It always goes sideways a little bit

5944
03:51:31.898 --> 03:51:32.758
no matter what you do.

5945
03:51:32.758 --> 03:51:35.296
That's the nature of the game.
SAM: I fucked us!

5946
03:51:35.296 --> 03:51:37.332
LIAM: A lot sideways.

5947
03:51:37.332 --> 03:51:39.050
MATT: To be fair, you were dodging

5948
03:51:39.050 --> 03:51:41.331
some crazy shit for awhile there.

5949
03:51:41.331 --> 03:51:43.914
SAM: I know, but if I had just shut up, we would've--

5950
03:51:43.914 --> 03:51:45.626
I don't know, we would've been okay.

5951
03:51:45.626 --> 03:51:47.043
MATT: Yeah, probably.

5952
03:51:48.988 --> 03:51:51.418
TALIESIN: There's a series of things that went wrong.

5953
03:51:51.418 --> 03:51:52.894
MATT: It's true.

5954
03:51:52.894 --> 03:51:54.328
That's D&amp;D, man.

5955
03:51:54.328 --> 03:51:55.547
That's how it happens.
LIAM: Sometimes you

5956
03:51:55.547 --> 03:51:56.864
teleport inside a dragon

5957
03:51:56.864 --> 03:51:59.466
or press the release acid button.

5958
03:51:59.466 --> 03:52:01.082
SAM: I didn't know who was who.

5959
03:52:01.082 --> 03:52:01.930
I couldn't hear anything.

5960
03:52:01.930 --> 03:52:04.058
My perception sucks.

5961
03:52:04.058 --> 03:52:06.016
TRAVIS and LAURA: I panicked!

5962
03:52:06.016 --> 03:52:06.849
SAM: I panicked; I thought

5963
03:52:06.849 --> 03:52:08.854
someone important was getting away!

5964
03:52:08.854 --> 03:52:10.029
LIAM: Ca-caw!

5965
03:52:11.419 --> 03:52:12.410
TRAVIS: It's okay, man.

5966
03:52:12.410 --> 03:52:13.450
TALIESIN: You remember how much easier this was

5967
03:52:13.450 --> 03:52:15.130
when we had magical earrings

5968
03:52:15.130 --> 03:52:17.130
that let us talk to each other?

5969
03:52:17.130 --> 03:52:19.503
MARISHA: We need to get those earrings.

5970
03:52:19.503 --> 03:52:22.920
TALIESIN: It's so campaign one though, isn't it?

5971
03:52:24.117 --> 03:52:25.946
MATT: You're stepping on OG territory.

5972
03:52:25.946 --> 03:52:27.255
TALIESIN: Clusterfuck is so much more fun.

5973
03:52:27.255 --> 03:52:28.361
TRAVIS: We upped the difficulty without them,

5974
03:52:28.361 --> 03:52:29.819
I like it.

5975
03:52:29.819 --> 03:52:31.402
TALIESIN: I kind of like the clusterfuck.

5976
03:52:31.402 --> 03:52:32.928
MATT: Me too.

5977
03:52:32.928 --> 03:52:35.361
All right. Well, thank you guys so much for watching.

5978
03:52:35.361 --> 03:52:37.239
You'll see some of us throughout the weekend

5979
03:52:37.239 --> 03:52:42.015
on D&amp;D Live as part of their Descent stream.

5980
03:52:42.015 --> 03:52:45.066
And of course, spread the word,

5981
03:52:45.066 --> 03:52:47.210
let's see if we can do our best to help out Red Nose Day.

5982
03:52:47.210 --> 03:52:48.262
They're amazing people

5983
03:52:48.262 --> 03:52:51.415
and see how we can guide this eventual story

5984
03:52:51.415 --> 03:52:53.738
for Stephen Colbert next week.

5985
03:52:53.738 --> 03:52:54.905
Super excited.

5986
03:52:55.965 --> 03:52:58.202
Don't forget, guys, we love you very much

5987
03:52:58.202 --> 03:53:00.170
and is it Thursday yet?

5988
03:53:00.170 --> 03:53:01.445
Good night.

5989
03:53:01.445 --> 03:53:02.279
LIAM and TALIESIN: No!
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!

5990
03:53:02.279 --> 03:53:05.112
[dramatic music]

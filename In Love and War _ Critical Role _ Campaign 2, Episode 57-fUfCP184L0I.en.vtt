00:00:00.142 --> 00:00:01.993
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.993 --> 00:00:03.866
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.576
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:09.521
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:11.509
MATT: Before we jump into this episode

6
00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.251
after two weeks of rest, we're happy to be back,

7
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.485
we've missed you guys terribly.

8
00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:17.009
We've missed each other terribly.

9
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:17.842
We've missed the game.

10
00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:21.370
Holy shit, what a way to hold onto the last episode.

11
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.203
TRAVIS: Hanger cliff.

12
00:00:22.203 --> 00:00:23.934
MATT: Hell of a hanger cliff there,

13
00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.358
but we'll jump into that shortly.

14
00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.755
Until then, we have some few announcements to get to

15
00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:31.968
beginning with our fantastic sponsors at D&amp;D Beyond.

16
00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:34.820
And welcome our friend, Paulie.

17
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.661
TRAVIS: Paulie?

18
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:36.911
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

19
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.258
SAM: Hey.

20
00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:40.174
Hey, guys.

21
00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:42.327
Oh, boy this is going to be hard.

22
00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:43.663
Nope.

23
00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:46.425
Hey, yo, I'm Paulie, I'm a shark.

24
00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:49.223
Full name's Paul Vincent D'Onofrio.

25
00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:50.693
No relation.

26
00:00:50.693 --> 00:00:52.828
I'm an East Coast shark, originally,

27
00:00:52.828 --> 00:00:55.759
but D&amp;D Beyond asked me to come over here

28
00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:58.094
and swim by and tell youse about their app

29
00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:00.251
and also to tell youse that they're heading

30
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:04.097
to the Mile High City for the Denver Pop Culture Con.

31
00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.834
Autographs and photo op tickets

32
00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:09.401
are now available at DenverPopCultureCon.com.

33
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.998
We're looking forward to meeting you.

34
00:01:10.998 --> 00:01:13.159
Why did they choose me to make this announcement?

35
00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.738
I got no freaking idea, I'm a freaking shark.

36
00:01:15.738 --> 00:01:19.708
The only D&amp;D I know are dungeness crabs and dragonfish.

37
00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:21.356
Hey!

38
00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:22.189
LAURA: No.

39
00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.712
SAM: Until recently, I thought an app

40
00:01:23.712 --> 00:01:27.455
was eating the boogie board before I eat the guy riding it.

41
00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:28.476
Badum-psh!

42
00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:29.955
Hey, but seriously, folks.

43
00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:30.788
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

44
00:01:30.788 --> 00:01:31.933
SAM: I shouldn't be here.
&amp;
45

46
00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:38.458
eating surfers, swimming, shutting down half my brain

47
00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:40.816
so I can go to sleep while I'm swimming,

48
00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:42.747
but when D&amp;D Beyond called me,

49
00:01:42.747 --> 00:01:44.348
I thought, hey, why not, right?

50
00:01:44.348 --> 00:01:45.361
I got some time.

51
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.058
Shark Week's not until July so

52
00:01:47.058 --> 00:01:51.647
I'll dig into it and holy carp!

53
00:01:51.647 --> 00:01:52.959
Let me tell you.

54
00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.835
This app is frigging money.

55
00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:58.859
They gots these cool weapons and classes, right?

56
00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.415
Blood mage, blood cleric, blood hunter?

57
00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.888
I'm a blood hunter, I can relate to that one!

58
00:02:04.888 --> 00:02:06.062
They got a thing in there.

59
00:02:06.062 --> 00:02:09.542
It's a home brew, but it's called a Sharkfolk?

60
00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:11.962
I started really getting into it, right?

61
00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:14.470
I went on the app, I bought some of their books

62
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.892
Out of the Abyss, Sword Coast,

63
00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:19.069
they even got one called Waterdeep.

64
00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.708
Hey, my backyard's water deep, hey, yo!

65
00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.367
LAURA: Oh no!

66
00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.429
SAM: I mean, come on.

67
00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:29.338
Lo and behold, one thing leads to another,

68
00:02:29.338 --> 00:02:32.655
bada bing, bada boom, now I got a frigging campaign going.

69
00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:35.463
Me and some pals, we toss out some chum,

70
00:02:35.463 --> 00:02:38.893
we play in an old shipwreck down there, it's real wholesome.

71
00:02:38.893 --> 00:02:43.176
My current character is a sea elf ranger

72
00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:45.468
named Ursula la Fin.

73
00:02:45.468 --> 00:02:50.250
I had some fan art for her done, but it got too wet.

74
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.058
I play with a great bunch of guys and girls.

75
00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:56.638
Jill the Hammerhead is our healer, Left Shark is our bard,

76
00:02:56.638 --> 00:02:59.888
this octopus named Frumpkin sometimes drops in,

77
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:03.604
my neighbor Nicky is our dungeness master, he's a crab,

78
00:03:03.604 --> 00:03:07.644
and we used to play with this surfer named Rode Slater,

79
00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:10.078
but I got hungry and I ate him.

80
00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:14.661
Anyway, so, what I'm saying to youse guys is-- almost done.

81
00:03:15.607 --> 00:03:17.956
What I'm saying to youse guys is

82
00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:19.999
we got room at the table, so if anyone out there

83
00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.299
is looking to join a cool campaign,

84
00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.753
shoot me an email, let me give you my email address, ready?

85
00:03:25.753 --> 00:03:28.086
(squeaking)

86
00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:31.121
LIAM: That's dolphin.

87
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.171
SAM: At earthlink.net.

88
00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:35.069
Anyway.

89
00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.860
TRAVIS: Earthlink?!

90
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.833
SAM: If an apex predator like me

91
00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:42.041
can get into D&amp;D Beyond, shouldn't you?

92
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.713
Sign up today or I'll hunt you down

93
00:03:43.713 --> 00:03:44.990
and kill you while you swim.

94
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.289
All right, bye, peace, everybody.

95
00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:49.835
(laughter)

96
00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:51.884
TRAVIS: Is that a tail and a fin?

97
00:03:51.884 --> 00:03:52.904
MATT: Thank you, Paulie.

98
00:03:52.904 --> 00:03:53.828
TRAVIS: What are you?

99
00:03:53.828 --> 00:03:55.661
SAM: Where can I smoke this thing?

100
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:56.890
Can I do it over here?

101
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.489
TRAVIS: Not in the studio.

102
00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.940
You got to go out to the sidewalk.

103
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.081
MATT: As we know,

104
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.632
when political votes start getting really close,

105
00:04:05.632 --> 00:04:07.131
people start pulling out all the stops

106
00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:09.448
and doing ridiculous things to get your attention,

107
00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:10.565
So thank you.

108
00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:12.929
LAURA: Isn't there a term called jumping the shark?

109
00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.973
MATT: Well, long, long ago did that occur, Laura.

110
00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:17.369
Thank you, Sam.

111
00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:18.202
And Paulie.

112
00:04:18.202 --> 00:04:19.204
LIAM: Drive me to drink.

113
00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:21.640
MATT: Thank you very much, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond,

114
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.298
for enduring the onslaught weekly

115
00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.623
that we all do.

116
00:04:27.674 --> 00:04:28.553
Oh, hey, Sam.

117
00:04:28.553 --> 00:04:31.611
SAM: Oh, hi, guys. Matt, I'm sorry I'm late.

118
00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:33.444
Did I miss anything?

119
00:04:33.444 --> 00:04:36.604
Did I miss some high quality comedy?

120
00:04:36.604 --> 00:04:39.769
TRAVIS: There was a shark named Paulie that came through.

121
00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:42.791
SAM: Oh, was it Paulie? Paulie Vincent D'Onofrio?

122
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.166
TRAVIS: Might have been the one.

123
00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:45.107
TALIESIN: You know them?

124
00:04:45.107 --> 00:04:46.557
SAM: Yeah, no relation.

125
00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:51.369
MATT: If you could hear through the accent,

126
00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:53.196
it was mentioned that we are heading

127
00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:58.196
to the Mile High City for Denver Pop Culture Con.

128
00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.361
Super excited to be out there in Colorado

129
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:02.843
to meet a bunch of you guys here coming up soon.

130
00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:04.121
Autographs, photo op tickets are now available

131
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:05.957
at DenverPopCultureCon.com.

132
00:05:05.957 --> 00:05:07.085
SAM: That wasn't part of my announcements--

133
00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:08.675
MATT: No, it was not, but you put it in there anyway.

134
00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.228
SAM: It says right here, "Sponsor: D&amp;D Beyond"

135
00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:14.346
and right under it, it says, "Welcome to the Mile High

136
00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.325
"Denver Pop Culture Con."
MATT: I'm sure they were

137
00:05:15.325 --> 00:05:17.056
as confused as we were when you--

138
00:05:17.056 --> 00:05:20.789
SAM: I read what's put in front of me, people!

139
00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.264
I'm not a mind reader.

140
00:05:22.264 --> 00:05:23.972
TRAVIS: Paulie reads what he can see

141
00:05:23.972 --> 00:05:25.221
between the teeth of his mouth.

142
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:26.622
SAM: He's got a very tiny shark brain.

143
00:05:26.622 --> 00:05:29.394
He can't-- that wasn't part of the announcement, was it?

144
00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:31.202
MATT: No, but now you know.

145
00:05:31.202 --> 00:05:34.508
Go to DenverPopCultureCon.com for information,

146
00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:36.519
looking forward to seeing you guys out there very soon.

147
00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:38.652
LIAM: You know, Denver, Colorado.

148
00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:43.151
TRAVIS: Rocky mountain high, Colorado!

149
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:43.984
Okay.

150
00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:46.367
MATT: There you go.

151
00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:47.312
While you're here, Sam,

152
00:05:47.312 --> 00:05:49.198
why don't you go ahead and tell us about

153
00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:50.656
what else is going on?

154
00:05:50.656 --> 00:05:51.526
In case you missed it,

155
00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:54.787
we released a special animatic preview on April 1st

156
00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:56.078
of our animated series

157
00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:57.463
the Legend of Vox Machina.

158
00:05:57.463 --> 00:05:59.087
LAURA: It's looking really good.

159
00:05:59.087 --> 00:06:00.651
SAM: Yeah, it is looking good.

160
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:02.499
There was a sneak peak.

161
00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:04.335
You can check it out now on our YouTube channel.

162
00:06:04.335 --> 00:06:06.627
Huge special thanks to our friend, Mike Morris,

163
00:06:06.627 --> 00:06:09.973
for designing the characters for that animatic.

164
00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:13.217
The campaign is still going strong. Right, Travis?

165
00:06:13.217 --> 00:06:14.266
TRAVIS: Going strong.

166
00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:15.533
SAM: Okay.

167
00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:18.384
You can join it, you can join the campaign

168
00:06:18.384 --> 00:06:22.437
to fund this animated series at criticalrole., nope,

169
00:06:22.437 --> 00:06:27.437
at critrole.com/animated and now it says here,

170
00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:28.842
"Would love to get a little insight

171
00:06:28.842 --> 00:06:32.639
"from Sam about how the video came together on stream."

172
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.544
I called up Mike Morris.

173
00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:35.931
TRAVIS and SAM: And he crushed it.

174
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:37.389
SAM: It was really good.

175
00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:38.229
TRAVIS: He blew us away.

176
00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.800
SAM: He put it together, including the designs

177
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.158
and also the wacky sound effects and it was awesome

178
00:06:43.158 --> 00:06:45.391
and it was a fun little April Fool's joke,

TRAVIS: (like a Scooby Doo villain) Yeah!

181
00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:53.172
MATT: I think I've actually seen that episode.

182
00:06:53.172 --> 00:06:55.706
TRAVIS: He really killed it, A-plus.

183
00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:57.701
MATT: Thank you, Sam.
SAM: Sure.

184
00:06:57.701 --> 00:06:59.115
MATT: And thank you guys.

Relatively short announcements this week so--

00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:04.491
SAM: Do you need me to put on the shark costume again

187
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:06.457
just to do some more?

188
00:07:06.457 --> 00:07:08.467
LAURA: Really, any time.

189
00:07:08.467 --> 00:07:09.888
MATT: That being the case, guys,

190
00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.570

[fire whooshing]

219
00:08:52.172 --> 00:08:53.921
MATT: And welcome back.

220
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:57.348
Last we left off: The Mighty Nein, having traversed

221
00:08:57.348 --> 00:09:00.548
the dangers and wastes of Xhorhas,

222
00:09:00.548 --> 00:09:05.248
in search of the recently captured husband of Nott,

223
00:09:05.248 --> 00:09:09.403
long estranged since her separation with her previous life.

224
00:09:09.403 --> 00:09:11.647
You made your way to the city of Asarius,

225
00:09:11.647 --> 00:09:14.724
the City of Beasts, you did some deeds

226
00:09:14.724 --> 00:09:19.139
for one of the local power figures, it seems, of the city,

227
00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:21.298
Lady Zethris Olios, and one of them

228
00:09:21.298 --> 00:09:24.395
was in trade for a favor of the Bright Queen.

229
00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:26.334
You were, faster than you expected,

230
00:09:26.334 --> 00:09:29.316
whisked away to a teleportation "siggle"--

231
00:09:29.316 --> 00:09:31.803
That's for you guys, there--

232
00:09:31.803 --> 00:09:35.684
- and brought to the Lucid Bastion

233
00:09:35.684 --> 00:09:40.487
in the center of the city of Rosohna, it seems,

234
00:09:40.487 --> 00:09:44.181
or Ghor Dranas as you've been hearing it referred to.

235
00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:46.688
There, as you are brought before

236
00:09:46.688 --> 00:09:51.470
the very court of the three ruling dens of the Kryn Dynasty.

237
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.152
You were given an audience

238
00:09:53.152 --> 00:09:56.735
with the Bright Queen, Leylas Kryn herself.

239
00:09:57.896 --> 00:10:01.151
Upon approaching, you made your case

240
00:10:01.151 --> 00:10:05.448
to meet with this mysterious prisoner

241
00:10:05.448 --> 00:10:07.660
that you had been seeking

242
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.876
and it seemed that one of the individuals

243
00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:14.375
who had traveled with you, this Lythir VaSuun,

244
00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:18.974
seemed to recognize you on your way towards this destination

245
00:10:18.974 --> 00:10:22.319
and piped up during this audience

246
00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:24.618
to notify the Bright Queen herself

247
00:10:24.618 --> 00:10:28.184
that he had been assaulted by you

248
00:10:28.184 --> 00:10:30.766
with intent to kill him and his companion

249
00:10:30.766 --> 00:10:34.671
on the borders of Xhorhas, across the Ashkeeper Peaks.

250
00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:36.410
In trying to defend yourselves

251
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.898
and make a convincing argument,

252
00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:39.316
unfortunately, due to the stress

253
00:10:39.316 --> 00:10:42.286
and terrible perpetual die rolls,

254
00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:43.647
it did not go in your favor.

255
00:10:43.647 --> 00:10:46.330
The guards were called and you were to be chained

256
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.035
and brought to some form of imprisonment.

257
00:10:49.035 --> 00:10:53.128
Amongst the chaos, a few knowing glances amongst the group

258
00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:58.128
and a silent agreement, Caleb approached Jester

259
00:10:58.483 --> 00:11:03.483
with clearance to make one final bid for peace,

260
00:11:03.874 --> 00:11:06.521
reached into her Handy Haversack

261
00:11:06.521 --> 00:11:10.154
and pulled out the dodecahedron,

262
00:11:10.154 --> 00:11:13.151
the beacon of which you'd been carrying for oh so long.

263
00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:16.252
Upon its presentation, the room falls silent,

264
00:11:16.252 --> 00:11:20.365
weapons clattering to the marble stone floors.

265
00:11:20.365 --> 00:11:23.082
As the Bright Queen took the object from your hands,

266
00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:27.806
tears in her eyes, proclaimed that

267
00:11:27.806 --> 00:11:32.389
you've brought hope to some degree back to these people

268
00:11:33.702 --> 00:11:37.627
and, in this moment, at least,

269
00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:40.712
you're heroes of the Dynasty.

270
00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:44.427
As the Bright Queen, Leylas Kryn,

271
00:11:44.427 --> 00:11:47.061
holds the shining beacon in her grasp,

272
00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:50.440
looking into its warm, pulsing glow,

273
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.888
you all standing among the gawking crowd

274
00:11:52.888 --> 00:11:56.989
of drow and goblin-kin nobles flanked by guards,

275
00:11:56.989 --> 00:12:01.219
weapons down or dropped, the silence is deafening

276
00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:05.536
and endless, in a moment that seems to stretch forever.

277
00:12:05.536 --> 00:12:07.132
Until it's broken.

278
00:12:07.132 --> 00:12:10.102
You hear doors open on two sides,

279
00:12:10.102 --> 00:12:13.037
as attendants of the court begin to enter.

280
00:12:13.037 --> 00:12:16.117
Whispers begin to scatter across

281
00:12:16.117 --> 00:12:19.750
the lips of the various onlooking figures.

282
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.984
Leylas, her expression changes from gratitude,

283
00:12:22.984 --> 00:12:25.317
the tears still wet on her cheeks,

284
00:12:25.317 --> 00:12:28.179
into a hardened woman, the same that you met

285
00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:30.804
when you first arrived.

286
00:12:30.804 --> 00:12:32.377
She turns and hands the artifact over

287
00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:36.230
to one of the nearby knights and looks back towards you

288
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.454
and then to the knight, whispers.

289
00:12:38.454 --> 00:12:41.805
"Take this to its vault in the Darkshire

290
00:12:41.805 --> 00:12:44.138
"and double the watch.

291
00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:50.297
"Your deed here is noted and what quarrel you have

292
00:12:50.297 --> 00:12:52.986
"with Lythir here is seen as absolved

293
00:12:52.986 --> 00:12:55.903
"in the eyes of us three dens.

00:12:58.786 --> 00:12:59.619
"So.

295
00:13:00.608 --> 00:13:03.222
"Travelers from the Empire

296
00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:06.222
"who renounce their home and history.

00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:09.200
"I have many questions,

298
00:13:10.058 --> 00:13:13.939
"as I'm sure you have some of your own.

299
00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:16.189
"I shall begin."

300
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:18.863
She backs and sits right atop her throne.

301
00:13:18.863 --> 00:13:21.101
Everyone who'd been standing, leaning forward,

302
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:22.180
the breath taken out of the room,

303
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.261
begin to come and rest back into their seats.

304
00:13:25.261 --> 00:13:27.056
Even Lythir himself taken aback

305
00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:31.998
by what just transpired, his expression moving from

306
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.087
anger and frustration to

307
00:13:39.227 --> 00:13:41.067
processing what just happened

308
00:13:41.067 --> 00:13:44.730
goes and stands quietly off to the side

309
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.563
from the central dais.

310
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.608
As Leylas Kryn sits on her throne,

311
00:13:50.608 --> 00:13:53.025
looking across you once more.

312
00:13:53.952 --> 00:13:56.702
"How did you come upon our beacon,

313
00:13:57.609 --> 00:14:00.526
"and why have you returned it to us?"

314
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:05.544
LIAM: That is a tricky story.

315
00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:11.264
To preface,

316
00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:16.964
it is difficult for me to say that we have

317
00:14:16.964 --> 00:14:18.500
turned our back on the Empire,

318
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.417
some of us are not from the Empire.

319
00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:25.799
Those of us who are and all of us

320
00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:28.770
have a fair share of skepticism

321
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.187
of how things are done there.

322
00:14:32.248 --> 00:14:33.611
I do not wish to see war,

323
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:36.680
I don't think any of us wish to see war.

324
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.763
MATT: "War is upon you whether you like it or not."

325
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.886
LIAM: We did come here to bring it to you

326
00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:51.994
but we have selfish reasons as well.

327
00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:54.751
MATT: "I would not be a fool to assume

328
00:14:54.751 --> 00:14:58.918
"that this was a purely altruistic journey for you.

329
00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:01.715
"Continue."

330
00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:04.108
LIAM: This is my friend.

331
00:15:04.108 --> 00:15:06.449
SAM: Hi.
LIAM: Nott the Brave.

332
00:15:09.523 --> 00:15:13.516
Her husband is here in this kingdom.

333
00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:14.791
I don't know if he is here

334
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:18.041
or somewhere else in your great nation,

335
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.370
but we have come to look for him

336
00:15:23.427 --> 00:15:26.510
and hopefully, today, leave with him.

337
00:15:27.946 --> 00:15:31.199
We are small pieces on this game board

338
00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:32.850
and I don't pretend to know

339
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.933
all the pieces moving on either side.

340
00:15:38.027 --> 00:15:42.033
I know that there are people where I come from

341
00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:46.866
who are watching for you and I know there are people here,

342
00:15:47.998 --> 00:15:50.665
watching from where I come from.

343
00:15:52.939 --> 00:15:56.919
Some may know better than I, but I know that Nott's husband

344
00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:00.910
is somehow tied to your beacon

345
00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:03.171
and the war.

346
00:16:07.264 --> 00:16:10.097
We'd like to take him back and I'm

347
00:16:11.058 --> 00:16:12.719
only hoping that our offering today

348
00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:15.469
makes that somewhat easier to do.

349
00:16:16.826 --> 00:16:18.743
MATT: "Is what he says true?"

350
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:21.902
SAM: It is, your Majesty,

351
00:16:24.022 --> 00:16:28.689
but not just my husband, he's the father of my child and

352
00:16:30.018 --> 00:16:33.185
I have been desperate to get him back,

353
00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:35.938
to make our family whole again.

354
00:16:35.938 --> 00:16:39.612
Surely even someone of your great stature

355
00:16:39.612 --> 00:16:44.612
must realize that reuniting a family with its,

356
00:16:44.868 --> 00:16:47.535
with its core and with its child

357
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.990
is the most important thing a mother could ask for.

358
00:16:54.123 --> 00:16:58.206
We may have fibbed a bit coming in the door, but

359
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.167
hopefully, you will see that our intentions are true

360
00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:04.917
and noble and honest.

361
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.723
I don't know what he's done to become imprisoned.

362
00:17:09.723 --> 00:17:13.595
He's gotten wrapped up in this whole magic business,

363
00:17:13.595 --> 00:17:16.762
but I just want him home with his son.

364
00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:20.883
MATT: The Bright Queen nods towards you

365
00:17:20.883 --> 00:17:24.002
and glances over towards one of the nearby

366
00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:27.035
male drow figures sitting to the right of the dais.

367
00:17:27.035 --> 00:17:32.035
Very handsome, head held high,

368
00:17:32.348 --> 00:17:35.305
looking down upon this with a curious glance.

369
00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:38.728
A similar mantle to what you noticed

370
00:17:38.728 --> 00:17:41.106
Lythir wearing, but much more elaborate.

371
00:17:41.106 --> 00:17:44.285
You can see the robes that he's wearing

372
00:17:44.285 --> 00:17:47.044
that pretty much entirely obscure the body.

373
00:17:47.044 --> 00:17:49.978
They just fall, the go entirely around the mantle

374
00:17:49.978 --> 00:17:52.559
and close in the front so it's this beautiful,

375
00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:55.287
draped, deep purple and black robe

376
00:17:55.287 --> 00:17:57.752
that completely obfuscates the body.

377
00:17:57.752 --> 00:18:02.020
Glances down and the Bright Queen turns and goes,

378
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.636
"Shadowhand, can we confirm that there has been

379
00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:11.237
some kind of imperial goblin capture?"

380
00:18:11.237 --> 00:18:13.501
SAM: (throat clearing)

381
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:17.580
He's not a goblin like I am.

382
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.764
He's a different sort.

383
00:18:20.764 --> 00:18:23.410
He's very handsome, he has bushy hair,

384
00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.728
pale skin, these long sideburns,

385
00:18:25.728 --> 00:18:29.850
I always told him to trim them, but they're very long.

386
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.009
He's a halfling man.

387
00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:35.743
His name is Yeza Brenatto.

388
00:18:35.743 --> 00:18:37.401
He's a chemist.

389
00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:38.892
MATT: The Shadowhand goes,

390
00:18:38.892 --> 00:18:41.400
"Yes, we do indeed have this figure

391
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.190
"in our Dungeon of Penance."

392
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.641
SAM: I'm sorry, Dungeon of Penance?

393
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:50.130
MATT: She puts her hand up.

394
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.454
"When this discussion is over,

395
00:18:52.454 --> 00:18:56.070
"take them with you to see this prisoner.

396
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.044
"Thank you, Shadowhand."

397
00:18:58.044 --> 00:18:59.461
He nods his head.

398
00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:05.723
"It is unique to see a

399
00:19:06.476 --> 00:19:10.296
"union of hearts between halfling and goblin,

400
00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:14.663
"but we also are a people who have lived

401
00:19:14.663 --> 00:19:18.582
"through many unique lives.

402
00:19:18.582 --> 00:19:20.749
"There is no judgment here."

403
00:19:21.753 --> 00:19:24.920
SAM: That's actually pretty nice to hear.

404
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.061
MATT: "So.

405
00:19:30.061 --> 00:19:32.061
"I have asked a question.

406
00:19:33.294 --> 00:19:36.711
"What is a question you would ask of me?"

407
00:19:40.784 --> 00:19:41.617
LAURA: Oh.

408
00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:43.890
SAM: What is?

409
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.883
LAURA: Does this mean we'll live here forever now and stuff?

410
00:19:48.883 --> 00:19:51.816
MATT: "Want to cut to the chase, I see.

411
00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:55.945
"Well, first,

412
00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:59.079
"I will say that this prisoner of yours

413
00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:03.427
"that you're requesting could possibly be returned to you.

414
00:20:03.427 --> 00:20:07.516
"I do not know the scope and depth of his involvement

415
00:20:07.516 --> 00:20:12.195
"with the conflict to the west, but

416
00:20:12.195 --> 00:20:15.487
"I'm certain the Shadowhand will inquire

417

"and if there is anything else required,

418
00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:22.476
"we will attempt to close our interrogation

419
00:20:22.476 --> 00:20:24.524
"and return him to you."

420
00:20:24.524 --> 00:20:27.107
SAM: Thank you, thank you so much.

421
00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:33.578
I'm so grateful, if there's any way I can repay you?

422
00:20:33.578 --> 00:20:38.185
MATT: "Well, this request you make is also a paltry gift in

423
00:20:38.185 --> 00:20:40.102
"trade for something as,

424
00:20:42.453 --> 00:20:46.608
"as incredible as what you brought to us."

425
00:20:46.608 --> 00:20:49.768
TRAVIS: I mean no disrespect with this question.

426
00:20:49.768 --> 00:20:53.512
We have been traveling with this beacon

427
00:20:53.512 --> 00:20:58.387
and we are mildly unaware of what it does.

428
00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:04.073
Would you mind sharing with us what it means to your people?

429
00:21:04.073 --> 00:21:05.605
MATT: (chuckles)

430
00:21:05.605 --> 00:21:10.121
A uniquely warm smile

431
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:12.817
and a head cock in your direction.

432
00:21:12.817 --> 00:21:15.575
You've caught a bit of interest from her.

433
00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:17.883
She leans back and, putting her fingers

434
00:21:17.883 --> 00:21:20.645
in a steepled position, goes,

435
00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:25.233
"This object that you so unknowingly brought to us

436
00:21:25.233 --> 00:21:28.259
"is known as a Luxon Beacon.

437
00:21:28.259 --> 00:21:33.259
"It is the body of the Lord of Light himself.

00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:44.665
"A long time ago, before the gods came,

"In his solitude, not understanding what he was,

445
00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:13.129
"It embraced it and scattered itself

446

"to bring fire and life.

447
00:22:18.085 --> 00:22:21.478
"That gave birth to the elements,

00:22:46.762 --> 00:22:50.739
"and we aim to find them--"
LAURA: So now you have five?

456
00:22:50.739 --> 00:22:52.072
MATT: "We have three."

457
00:22:54.462 --> 00:22:55.728
TRAVIS: Recovered four.

MARISHA: Do you have any idea

462
00:23:03.493 --> 00:23:06.326
where the fourth one is right now?

463
00:23:07.513 --> 00:23:09.846

LIAM: That was my next question.

468
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:31.354
Where we are from, all we hear of is the big bad other

469
00:23:31.354 --> 00:23:33.846
from Xhorhas, invading.

470
00:23:35.153 --> 00:23:37.251
This is what it's about?

471
00:23:37.251 --> 00:23:39.059
These?

472
00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:41.142
MATT: "There are many reasons.

473
00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:44.596

the Empire for some time."

505
00:25:56.365 --> 00:25:57.748
the drow that are all sitting,

506

507
00:25:59.882 --> 00:26:04.874
withered, ancient elder female goblin,

508

two-and-a-half feet, almost to her toes,

510
00:26:11.628 --> 00:26:16.079

dark blue and black robes.

Sits out of the chair, this ancient,

female-Yoda-esque figure, steps forward.

00:27:54.518 --> 00:27:57.596
"and whatever gods would vie for its dominion.

"The beacon draws it back.

"same range of the beacon,

the spirit is given another life."

547
00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:11.251
LAURA: I knew it!

548
00:28:13.794 --> 00:28:17.787
MATT: "When the child comes of age to adolescence,

549
00:28:17.787 --> 00:28:21.806
"they begin to recall memories,

00:28:21.806 --> 00:28:25.697
"visions, dreams of lives past,

"to eventually become an Umavi."

562
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.674
LAURA: What is an Umavi?

563
00:29:16.674 --> 00:29:19.439
MATT: "An Umavi is a perfect soul."

564
00:29:19.439 --> 00:29:22.470
"One who's lived enough lives to have learned

565
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:27.403
"the secrets to learn the true meaning of why they are here

"when it is reborn, to give it purpose."

568
00:29:36.777 --> 00:29:39.015
LAURA: Does that mean that we were carrying around

569
00:29:39.015 --> 00:29:41.598
a whole bunch of souls with us?

570
00:29:42.815 --> 00:29:45.237
MATT: "Possibly."

571
00:29:45.237 --> 00:29:50.212
MARISHA: We also peeked in a few times, into the beacon.

572
00:29:51.663 --> 00:29:56.061
MATT: The Blackhand who previously was standing there

573
00:29:56.061 --> 00:29:59.528
with the enclosed cloak goes,

574
00:29:59.528 --> 00:30:02.894
"The Luxon is also the source of

575
00:30:02.894 --> 00:30:07.102
"a very potent magical force.

"What you may have gleaned

577

"from staring into one of these beacons

"is one of many funnels of dunamis power.

00:30:19.243 --> 00:30:21.888
"It is the basis of how we've been able

580
00:30:21.888 --> 00:30:24.495
"to free ourselves from the binds

581
00:30:24.495 --> 00:30:27.658
"of the lineage the Betrayer Gods left for us

"and to carve our own fates, choose our own paths

583
00:30:31.512 --> 00:30:34.188
"and sidestep these destinies placed upon us

584
00:30:34.188 --> 00:30:38.105
"nonchalantly by gods that use us as playthings."

585
00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:41.306
MARISHA: Okay.

586
00:30:43.895 --> 00:30:44.918
MATT: The Bright Queen leans forward

587
00:30:44.918 --> 00:30:48.547
and puts hands up to both tell them to back off.

588
00:30:48.547 --> 00:30:51.748
"So you have asked some questions.

589
00:30:51.748 --> 00:30:53.848
"It's my turn.

590
00:30:55.876 --> 00:30:59.967
"Now, this favor, if we can indeed give it,

591
00:30:59.967 --> 00:31:03.679
"is comparable to a certain degree,

592
00:31:03.679 --> 00:31:06.855
"but is there anything else you would ask?

593
00:31:06.855 --> 00:31:09.855
"I do not wish to keep debts."

594
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.110
TALIESIN: Free passage.

595
00:31:14.481 --> 00:31:15.815
SAM: To where?

596
00:31:15.815 --> 00:31:17.426
TALIESIN: Where we choose to go.

597
00:31:17.426 --> 00:31:21.893
We are moving towards our own destinies

598
00:31:23.528 --> 00:31:26.094
and serve our own interests.

599
00:31:28.746 --> 00:31:32.421
MATT: "To that point, I did notice

600
00:31:32.421 --> 00:31:34.158
"that some of you would have a

601
00:31:34.158 --> 00:31:36.705
"difficult time traversing Xhorhas."

602
00:31:36.705 --> 00:31:39.527
Glances over towards the

603
00:31:39.527 --> 00:31:42.005
leather-strap laden humans in the party.

604
00:31:42.005 --> 00:31:44.344
MARISHA: Would someone cut these off me, please?

605
00:31:44.344 --> 00:31:45.177
LAURA: They look so pretty, though.

606
00:31:45.177 --> 00:31:46.752
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
00:31:46.752 --> 00:31:49.497
I'll summon the falchion and just off the back collar.

608
00:31:49.497 --> 00:31:52.231
Caleb with the same.

609
00:31:54.227 --> 00:31:55.428
LAURA: Sorry about that.

610
00:31:55.428 --> 00:31:57.936
MARISHA: Never doing that again.

611
00:31:59.368 --> 00:32:00.813
MATT: "The capital city specifically

612
00:32:00.813 --> 00:32:04.184
"would be a difficult place to tread with such company.

613
00:32:04.184 --> 00:32:07.980
"I'm genuinely surprised you made it this far."

614
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.718
LAURA: We're pretty talented.
SAM: Yeah, we are.

615
00:32:09.718 --> 00:32:12.420
MATT: "I will grant you my emblems of trust.

616
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:16.318
"Do not lose them, for I only grant them once."

617
00:32:16.318 --> 00:32:18.526
She puts her hand up and one of the nearby

618
00:32:18.526 --> 00:32:21.008
assistants comes up to the side of the throne

619
00:32:21.008 --> 00:32:23.325
on the right-hand side, puts aside a curtain,

620
00:32:23.325 --> 00:32:26.623
and pulls out a small box, opens it,

621
00:32:26.623 --> 00:32:27.969
rummages through it,

622
00:32:27.969 --> 00:32:31.612
putting a stack of these small, silver medallions,

623
00:32:31.612 --> 00:32:33.822
closes the box, shuts it, and comes forward

624
00:32:33.822 --> 00:32:36.580
and presents one to each of you.

625
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.755
Within the center of each of these emblems--

626
00:32:38.755 --> 00:32:41.083
they're about that big, they're not incredibly huge.

627
00:32:41.083 --> 00:32:43.094
A little bit larger than a gold piece.

628
00:32:43.094 --> 00:32:45.378
In the center, you see a carved symbol

629
00:32:45.378 --> 00:32:48.262
of the dodecahedron with

630
00:32:48.262 --> 00:32:50.622
a circle around it, but the circle is broken in places

631
00:32:50.622 --> 00:32:52.307
and twisting inward to form

632
00:32:52.307 --> 00:32:56.836
a protracted, sideways eight

633
00:32:56.836 --> 00:32:59.936
that merges with it and extends.

634
00:33:01.563 --> 00:33:04.722
"These symbolize an ally of the Dynasty.

635
00:33:04.722 --> 00:33:07.391
"Keep them close, for many would wish to take them

636
00:33:07.391 --> 00:33:11.558
"and abuse the access they provide in times of war."

637
00:33:13.553 --> 00:33:15.978
SAM: Thank you, thank you very much.

638
00:33:15.978 --> 00:33:17.887
TRAVIS: Yeah, we will guard them closely.

639
00:33:17.887 --> 00:33:19.371
TALIESIN: Most generous.

640
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:20.769
LAURA: Yeah.

641
00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:22.429
MATT: "Have you any further curiosities?"

642
00:33:22.429 --> 00:33:24.453
SAM and MARISHA: Yes.

643
00:33:24.453 --> 00:33:25.513
SAM: So many.

644
00:33:25.513 --> 00:33:26.863
TALIESIN: Sadly.

645
00:33:27.869 --> 00:33:30.252
SAM: I don't know if my friend over here,

646
00:33:30.252 --> 00:33:33.631
who spoke so eloquently on my behalf, would

647
00:33:33.631 --> 00:33:37.956
dare ask it, but I think he would seek knowledge.

648
00:33:39.353 --> 00:33:44.353
You must have access to powerful magic learning

649
00:33:44.778 --> 00:33:47.537
and books?

650
00:33:47.537 --> 00:33:48.996
MATT: (chuckles)

651
00:33:48.996 --> 00:33:52.043
SAM: He's a talented magic user himself,

652
00:33:52.043 --> 00:33:54.188
and maybe one who could be of use

653
00:33:54.188 --> 00:33:57.746
to your Dynasty at some point.

654
00:33:57.746 --> 00:34:00.246
LIAM: If I could bridge upon that,

655
00:34:01.318 --> 00:34:04.546
one request that I had, I have two,

656
00:34:04.546 --> 00:34:09.496
but one is that her ladyship consider that

657
00:34:10.636 --> 00:34:15.061
the Empire we are from is full of very good people.

658
00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:19.738
Most, almost all.

659
00:34:21.431 --> 00:34:26.010
I have been scarred by the few who do not fit that category

660
00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:30.985
and rather than kill the entire animal,

661
00:34:32.314 --> 00:34:35.281
I ask that you consider

662
00:34:36.598 --> 00:34:41.565
cutting the cancer out, so that the whole may live.

663
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:49.070
MARISHA: I understand wanting retribution and it's earned.

664
00:34:50.723 --> 00:34:54.998
You all have endured a lot, it seems.

665
00:34:55.978 --> 00:34:58.748
But equal suffering to

666
00:34:58.748 --> 00:35:01.915
countless innocents on the other side,

667
00:35:02.952 --> 00:35:06.946
I don't know if it would feel as satisfying as you think.

668
00:35:06.946 --> 00:35:11.885
What if we could offer judgment

669
00:35:11.885 --> 00:35:16.704
and vindication towards those individuals

670
00:35:16.704 --> 00:35:20.287
that are actually involved in wronging you?

671
00:35:22.518 --> 00:35:24.851
MATT: You see this soft,

672
00:35:26.785 --> 00:35:30.639
distant thinking expression cross over her face.

673
00:35:30.639 --> 00:35:33.363
MARISHA: Consider you might not be at war

674
00:35:33.363 --> 00:35:35.995
with the entire Empire?

675
00:35:35.995 --> 00:35:40.378
It may be a handful of assholes instead.

676
00:35:42.433 --> 00:35:46.987
TALIESIN: Through retribution, one would eventually end up

677
00:35:46.987 --> 00:35:49.258
with an unending line of enemies.

678
00:35:49.258 --> 00:35:51.954
There is no end to that.

679
00:35:51.954 --> 00:35:56.313
It's not a thing that can be found.

680
00:35:57.836 --> 00:36:02.819
MATT: Her expression turns strangely very dark.

681
00:36:05.486 --> 00:36:08.324
Like uncharacteristically.

682
00:36:08.324 --> 00:36:13.266
She just looks ahead and goes,

683
00:36:13.266 --> 00:36:17.674
"The world is not as easy as you say.

684
00:36:17.674 --> 00:36:22.674
"We do not wish to commit genocide,

685
00:36:23.169 --> 00:36:27.836
"but defending us means that innocents will die, perhaps.

686
00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:33.177
"You have not seen the things I have seen.

687
00:36:33.177 --> 00:36:37.040
"You have not known the atrocities

688
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.006
"of the Calamity like I have.

689
00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.707
"In these 1200 years that I have lived,

690
00:36:44.707 --> 00:36:48.323
"and lived, and lived, and lived again,

691
00:36:48.323 --> 00:36:52.503
"I have also known that the people who live

692
00:36:52.503 --> 00:36:55.966
"under such banners, themselves

693
00:36:55.966 --> 00:36:58.718
"believe what they've been fed.

694
00:36:58.718 --> 00:37:01.737
"So if there are those you care for

695
00:37:01.737 --> 00:37:04.183
"and those you believe do not deserve

696
00:37:04.183 --> 00:37:08.134
"the hammer that will fall upon those lands,

697
00:37:08.134 --> 00:37:10.906
"then perhaps you should tell them to leave,

698
00:37:10.906 --> 00:37:13.533
"for war's coming.

699
00:37:13.533 --> 00:37:16.112
"We cannot stop it because they will not

700
00:37:16.112 --> 00:37:20.072
"and I'm not about to let them have

701
00:37:20.072 --> 00:37:23.355
"the first and final strike."

702
00:37:24.398 --> 00:37:28.872
TRAVIS: Understood. I think I speak for all of us

703
00:37:28.872 --> 00:37:32.098
in saying that there is no way that we could

704
00:37:32.098 --> 00:37:37.015
even begin to imagine what you've seen over 1200 years.

705
00:37:37.015 --> 00:37:41.915
I'm sure we would be honored to learn

706
00:37:47.161 --> 00:37:49.258
if you would.

707
00:37:49.258 --> 00:37:52.452
I, myself, am from south of the Empire

708
00:37:52.452 --> 00:37:56.619
and unfamiliar with their ways as I am with yours.

709
00:37:57.948 --> 00:37:59.763
I only seek to enlighten myself

710
00:37:59.763 --> 00:38:02.430
and maybe see a clearer picture.

711
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:06.427
If we're to be guests here and

712
00:38:06.427 --> 00:38:08.716
find ourselves in your favor,

713
00:38:08.716 --> 00:38:09.760
I think it would serve all of us

714
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.509
if, perhaps, we knew a bit more

715
00:38:12.509 --> 00:38:17.492
about your relationship with the Empire and the world.

716
00:38:18.403 --> 00:38:23.345
MATT: "Well, let me ask you a question then.

717
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:30.163
"My final question.

718
00:38:30.163 --> 00:38:35.105
"You have many great gifts to have found your way here,

719
00:38:36.916 --> 00:38:38.062
"and you have seen many things

720
00:38:38.062 --> 00:38:42.062
"that may be helpful in the battles to come, yes?

721
00:38:43.877 --> 00:38:48.283
"Will you join us in this struggle

722
00:38:48.283 --> 00:38:53.283
"to reclaim our final lost relic of renewal?

723
00:38:54.022 --> 00:38:58.002
"And help us punish these insolent murderers

724
00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:01.419
"who cut us down and steal our birthright?

725
00:39:02.922 --> 00:39:05.990
MARISHA: If we do this,

726
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:08.116
will you halt the attacks that you've been waging

727
00:39:08.116 --> 00:39:13.092
on the towns, like Felderwin?

728
00:39:13.092 --> 00:39:16.348
At least give us a chance?

729
00:39:16.348 --> 00:39:19.098
MATT: "It is not something I can halt.

730
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:25.040
"It is something that must pass to keep the balance."

731
00:39:26.168 --> 00:39:28.921
LAURA: It's all about the balance.

732
00:39:28.921 --> 00:39:31.462
TRAVIS: You said that two people entered the room behind us

733
00:39:31.462 --> 00:39:33.519
before this all started, right?

734
00:39:33.519 --> 00:39:37.687
Two other individuals before she got very serious?

735
00:39:37.687 --> 00:39:42.687
MATT: Meaning there were assistants that came in.

736
00:39:42.893 --> 00:39:46.841
TRAVIS: Can we look around and see if anyone is actively

737
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:50.657
casting anything, using anything?

738
00:39:50.657 --> 00:39:53.226
MATT: Make a perception check.

739
00:39:53.226 --> 00:39:56.130
TRAVIS: Just at a glance behind us.

740
00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.963
Oh, natural 19. 17.

741
00:40:00.001 --> 00:40:01.939
MATT: Natural 19 turns to a 17?

742
00:40:01.939 --> 00:40:04.361
TRAVIS: Oh, plus two, no, 21.

743
00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:08.198
SAM: Reverse math.
TRAVIS: Sorry.

744
00:40:09.582 --> 00:40:11.266
MATT: You don't--

745
00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:15.036
(laughs)

746
00:40:15.036 --> 00:40:17.669
That's fine, you missed it.

747
00:40:17.669 --> 00:40:21.712
You glance around the chamber.

748
00:40:21.712 --> 00:40:25.181
You don't see anything that looks like

749
00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:28.645
dubious spell casting or hand movements or muttering.

750
00:40:28.645 --> 00:40:29.841
There are whispers back and forth,

751
00:40:29.841 --> 00:40:31.249
but they seem to be conversational

752
00:40:31.249 --> 00:40:33.811
and quietly kept between members

753
00:40:33.811 --> 00:40:36.688
of the various dens, as you've heard them called,

754
00:40:36.688 --> 00:40:41.173
that exist in this central throne area.

755
00:40:41.173 --> 00:40:46.115
But nothing that signifies untoward spell casting.

756
00:40:47.054 --> 00:40:48.523
TRAVIS: I can't speak for my friends,

757
00:40:48.523 --> 00:40:50.200
I will let them speak for themselves,

758
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.569
but I would say I do not know.

759
00:40:52.569 --> 00:40:56.163
I do not know you, I do not know this land or this Dynasty.

760
00:40:56.163 --> 00:40:57.944
I'm interested to learn.

761
00:40:57.944 --> 00:41:02.473
That's the best I can offer.

762
00:41:02.473 --> 00:41:04.791
TALIESIN: We serve the living.

763
00:41:04.791 --> 00:41:08.261
For as long as we walk

764
00:41:08.261 --> 00:41:12.493
in your kingdom, we will serve all goodness

765
00:41:12.493 --> 00:41:16.265
that we come in contact with.

766
00:41:16.265 --> 00:41:21.265
But we do not, and I also apologize if I speak for everyone,

767
00:41:24.434 --> 00:41:27.169
we are new to this place and would know it better

768
00:41:27.169 --> 00:41:31.917
before we would feel comfortable giving you such fealty.

769
00:41:31.917 --> 00:41:34.185
I'm not saying it won't happen in the future,

770
00:41:34.185 --> 00:41:36.990
I would just say that I would like to know you better,

771
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.465
know your people better.

772
00:41:39.465 --> 00:41:44.373
Again, we have things that we are looking for.

773
00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:50.769
LIAM: And Umavi, I beseech you.

774
00:41:52.126 --> 00:41:56.380
The fact that we have brought what we have brought to you

775
00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:00.054
shows-- I know that you have lived so long--

776
00:42:00.054 --> 00:42:03.270
but I hope shows

777
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:06.153
that our people are able to change

778
00:42:06.153 --> 00:42:11.153
and shake off the bonds that they have grown up under.

779
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.340
TALIESIN: We could have easily all been killed

780
00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.604
in one of these attacks or on our way here and

781
00:42:18.604 --> 00:42:21.640
this object would have been lost forever.

782
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.574
Through the practical thinking of war.

783
00:42:28.527 --> 00:42:33.022
MATT: "Have each of you been able to

784
00:42:33.022 --> 00:42:37.622
"take a passing glimpse into the infinite

785
00:42:37.622 --> 00:42:42.156
"might and power of possibility of the Luxon?"

786
00:42:42.156 --> 00:42:43.493
TRAVIS: I think you have.

787
00:42:43.493 --> 00:42:47.659
SAM: We all took a gander, yeah.

788
00:42:47.659 --> 00:42:50.212
LAURA: It was really powerful stuff.

789
00:42:50.212 --> 00:42:52.554
MATT: "Hold onto that.

790
00:42:52.554 --> 00:42:57.352
"As you take your time, as you find your way,

791
00:42:57.352 --> 00:43:02.340
"Imagine what good can be done

792
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:07.340
"if everyone could come to know that same power.

793
00:43:07.709 --> 00:43:09.418
"If instead of fighting and squabbling

794
00:43:09.418 --> 00:43:12.226
"over the location of the truth,

795
00:43:12.226 --> 00:43:17.217
"if we could all work together to find them.

796
00:43:19.325 --> 00:43:22.659
"Whom do you worship?"

797
00:43:26.035 --> 00:43:28.663
TALIESIN: I serve the Wildmother.

798
00:43:28.663 --> 00:43:33.663
I'm searching for

799
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:38.535
a crematory, a kiln in the mountains.

800
00:43:38.535 --> 00:43:41.257
Have you heard of such a thing?

801
00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:47.262
MATT: "I can't say that I have, but

802
00:43:47.262 --> 00:43:50.372
"I can certainly ask around."

803
00:43:50.372 --> 00:43:54.072
TALIESIN: Regardless, we'll find it.

804
00:43:56.769 --> 00:44:01.251
MATT: "I hope she serves you well when the time comes.

805
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:04.263
LAURA: She brought him back to life.

806
00:44:04.263 --> 00:44:06.368
With my help, I mean.

807
00:44:06.368 --> 00:44:09.299
TALIESIN: Thank you.
LAURA: Yeah.

808
00:44:09.299 --> 00:44:12.265
MATT: "But should you die,

809
00:44:12.265 --> 00:44:17.265
what could a new life bring to you?

810
00:44:17.511 --> 00:44:22.444
"Regardless, I appreciate you taking your time

811
00:44:23.513 --> 00:44:25.906
"and I understand you have many things to consider

812
00:44:25.906 --> 00:44:30.179
"and there is no immediate rush.

813
00:44:30.179 --> 00:44:31.012
"For now."

814
00:44:32.749 --> 00:44:36.977
MARISHA: One more question, if you don't mind, in our

815
00:44:36.977 --> 00:44:40.563
seek for understanding and knowledge.

816
00:44:40.563 --> 00:44:45.496
Your symbol, it's beautiful.

817
00:44:45.496 --> 00:44:50.496
Can you explain its meaning to me a little bit more?

818
00:44:51.036 --> 00:44:55.303
MATT: "The lines represent the cycle of souls,

819
00:44:55.303 --> 00:44:58.858
"continuing forever.

820
00:44:58.858 --> 00:45:01.824
"It is within the light of the Luxon

821
00:45:01.824 --> 00:45:04.373
"that there is no end to it.

822
00:45:04.373 --> 00:45:08.376
"We don't become collections, we don't become

00:45:08.376 --> 00:45:13.176
"bartering pieces for entities and gods

824
00:45:13.176 --> 00:45:18.176
"that argue and fight.

"We forge our own path.

"In his divine light and warmth,

"and learn and teach forever.

"Those lines are the paths of the souls to infinity

"within the Luxon."

831
00:45:37.303 --> 00:45:42.028
MARISHA: Well, I would just urge you to consider

832
00:45:42.028 --> 00:45:46.923
that a woman so adherent to cycles,

833
00:45:46.923 --> 00:45:51.898
I believe you also have the power to break them as well.

834
00:45:56.596 --> 00:45:58.891
LAURA: Did you just ask her if she was on her period?

835
00:45:58.891 --> 00:46:02.651
SAM: I don't think that's what she was asking.

836
00:46:02.651 --> 00:46:06.665
MATT: There's a moment where the Bright Queen,

837
00:46:06.665 --> 00:46:10.272
the shoulders shift a bit and a coy grin

838
00:46:10.272 --> 00:46:14.265
hits the left side of her mouth.

839
00:46:14.265 --> 00:46:17.848
MARISHA: Forgive me if that was too forward.

840
00:46:17.848 --> 00:46:21.297
MATT: "Just surprising.

841
00:46:21.297 --> 00:46:26.179
"You are surprising.

842
00:46:27.144 --> 00:46:32.111
"Well, there are matters I must attend to.

"Shadowhand Essek.

"Help them find a place to stay,

:for her projects, perhaps there is good to be done there."

851
00:47:02.997 --> 00:47:04.877
LIAM: What was that name again?

852
00:47:04.877 --> 00:47:09.835
MATT: Waccoh. W-A-C-C-O-H.

853
00:47:10.834 --> 00:47:15.834
LAURA: Are we going to the prison now?

854
00:47:16.138 --> 00:47:18.050
MATT: "Essek, if you do not mind, take them

855

"to the Dungeon of Penance

"through the Shadowshire and see them to the prison."

LAURA: Thank you.

858
00:47:26.278 --> 00:47:27.253
MATT: "Thank you."

859
00:47:27.253 --> 00:47:29.044
SAM: Caleb!

860
00:47:29.044 --> 00:47:31.293
Should we have the?

861
00:47:36.788 --> 00:47:41.788
TRAVIS: As we start to turn, can I call out to Lythir?

862
00:47:42.586 --> 00:47:43.419
MATT: "Yes?"

863
00:47:44.453 --> 00:47:48.394
TRAVIS: No hard feelings, all right?

864
00:47:48.394 --> 00:47:51.102
MATT: "None taken."

865
00:47:55.168 --> 00:47:56.214
Do you guys leave?

866
00:47:56.214 --> 00:47:57.047
SAM: I guess so.

867
00:47:57.047 --> 00:48:01.001
MATT: The Shadowhand Essek, who you've heard referred to,

868
00:48:01.001 --> 00:48:02.604
steps to the front of your troop,

869
00:48:02.604 --> 00:48:05.549
not even making eye contact just (whooshes),

870
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:06.518
you watch the cloak.

871
00:48:06.518 --> 00:48:08.529
You don't even really see the feet touch the ground,

872
00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:11.135
though you hear the footfalls with the cloak

873
00:48:11.135 --> 00:48:13.484
just gently pulling back about an inch past

874
00:48:13.484 --> 00:48:15.254
where it touches the floor.

875
00:48:15.254 --> 00:48:18.576
The wide and hooked edges of the mantle

876
00:48:18.576 --> 00:48:19.615
framing the back of the head.

877
00:48:19.615 --> 00:48:21.058
The very short, white hair

878
00:48:21.058 --> 00:48:23.778
that comes to this beautiful

879
00:48:23.778 --> 00:48:26.998
half-curved coif to one side.

880
00:48:26.998 --> 00:48:28.845
Walking ahead and leading you towards the doors

881
00:48:28.845 --> 00:48:30.705
where you originally entered.

882
00:48:30.705 --> 00:48:33.364
Stopping part way and looking over his shoulder and going,

883
00:48:33.364 --> 00:48:35.533
"Are you following?"

884
00:48:35.533 --> 00:48:36.493
LAURA: Yes.

885
00:48:36.493 --> 00:48:38.404
SAM: Mm-hm.

886
00:48:38.404 --> 00:48:40.614
MATT: Leads you on into the antechamber.

887
00:48:40.614 --> 00:48:44.192
The doors close behind (booming).

888
00:48:44.192 --> 00:48:47.758
"Do you require a moment to speak amongst yourselves? Or?"

889
00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:48.599
SAM: Yep.

890
00:48:48.599 --> 00:48:50.624
TRAVIS: Same antechamber with the fountain

891
00:48:50.624 --> 00:48:51.568
and the three cups?

892
00:48:51.568 --> 00:48:52.768
MATT: Yeah.

893
00:48:52.768 --> 00:48:55.374
TRAVIS: If you wouldn't mind, we'd appreciate it.

894
00:48:55.374 --> 00:48:59.444
Just to check our pants and make sure no one needs a change.

895
00:48:59.444 --> 00:49:00.670
MATT: "A common reaction.

896
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.526
"I'll be on the other side. Knock when you're ready."

897
00:49:02.526 --> 00:49:03.790
MARISHA: Hey.

898
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.433
Is there, like, listening devices in here?

899
00:49:06.433 --> 00:49:08.229
You guys monitoring us?

900
00:49:08.229 --> 00:49:09.333
TRAVIS: Not that that matters.

901
00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:10.518
MATT: "Why, is there anything to mistrust?"

902
00:49:10.518 --> 00:49:11.776
TRAVIS: Nope, open book.

903
00:49:11.776 --> 00:49:14.558
Every page being written as we speak.

904
00:49:14.558 --> 00:49:17.073
We'll be out shortly.

905
00:49:17.073 --> 00:49:19.589
MARISHA: Just curious!

906
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.467
MATT: He turns and exits out the other door.

907
00:49:21.467 --> 00:49:23.341
They come to a close

908
00:49:23.341 --> 00:49:26.477
and you have, for an undisclosed period of time,

909
00:49:26.477 --> 00:49:29.343
it seems, privacy here within the antechamber.

910
00:49:29.343 --> 00:49:32.089
TRAVIS: (blowing)
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.

911
00:49:32.089 --> 00:49:35.200
MATT: Cast Detect Magic?

912
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:40.200
The only bit of magic that you find at this point

913
00:49:40.391 --> 00:49:43.139
is amongst your group and the items you're wearing.

914
00:49:43.139 --> 00:49:45.970
TALIESIN: Okay.

915
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:49.520
Nothing seems to be,

916
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.917
nothing mystical happening in this place,

917
00:49:51.917 --> 00:49:55.666
so I think if they are listening, they're listening

918
00:49:55.666 --> 00:49:57.557
with the old cup and string.

919
00:49:57.557 --> 00:49:58.574
SAM: I'm going to go around

920
00:49:58.574 --> 00:50:03.172
to some corners and throw some liquid around,

921
00:50:03.172 --> 00:50:05.576
see if it splashes on any invisible people.

922
00:50:05.576 --> 00:50:07.545
TALIESIN: I just did a Detect Magic.

923
00:50:07.545 --> 00:50:09.030
SAM: Sure, but they might have been--

924
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.783
MATT: Make an investigation check, sure.

925
00:50:11.783 --> 00:50:13.221
SAM: A lot.

926
00:50:13.221 --> 00:50:14.817
MATT: It's a splashy water investigation check.

927
00:50:14.817 --> 00:50:16.164
SAM: 24.

928
00:50:16.164 --> 00:50:17.399
MATT: 24, okay.

929
00:50:17.399 --> 00:50:19.223
(splashing)

930
00:50:19.223 --> 00:50:21.223
LIAM: "Hey!"

931
00:50:22.125 --> 00:50:22.958
TALIESIN: Blacklight.

932
00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:24.983
MATT: Nothing seems to catch your attention.

933
00:50:24.983 --> 00:50:27.921
I would not recommend that in here.

934
00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:30.472
TRAVIS: Well, that went--

935
00:50:30.472 --> 00:50:31.508
MARISHA: What the fuck?!

936
00:50:31.508 --> 00:50:32.566
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

937
00:50:32.566 --> 00:50:35.983
LAURA: Exactly as we totally thought it would happen, Caleb.

938
00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:42.050
LIAM: I don't think that was our first choice of an ending,

939
00:50:42.222 --> 00:50:45.025
but it is one we discussed.

940
00:50:45.025 --> 00:50:47.145
TALIESIN: You made the right call.

941
00:50:47.145 --> 00:50:50.191
I'm very proud of you.

942
00:50:50.191 --> 00:50:51.818
SAM: I am, too.

943
00:50:51.818 --> 00:50:55.418
I think it was the smartest choice of action.

944
00:50:55.418 --> 00:50:58.591
And now we have an ally that we wouldn't have had otherwise.

945
00:50:58.591 --> 00:51:03.591
LAURA: With really, really cool armor.

946
00:51:03.819 --> 00:51:06.152
LIAM: We need to talk at length

947
00:51:06.152 --> 00:51:09.327
and I don't know if we can do it here.

948
00:51:09.327 --> 00:51:10.160
TALIESIN: I don't think, perhaps,

949
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.257
here is the place but we can at least--

950
00:51:12.257 --> 00:51:13.740
LAURA: Are you okay, Fjord?

951
00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.223
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I'm fine.

952
00:51:16.223 --> 00:51:21.223
Yeah, I'm happy to be alive and not in jail.

953
00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:28.607
I wish we had a bit more of a chance to explore the,

954
00:51:28.607 --> 00:51:33.607
the soul box, as it were.

955
00:51:33.817 --> 00:51:34.879
SAM: But knowing what we know now,

956
00:51:34.879 --> 00:51:37.448
I don't know that we could have done anything with it.

957
00:51:37.448 --> 00:51:40.696
TRAVIS: What do we know now? What she told us?

958
00:51:40.696 --> 00:51:42.079
TALIESIN: I think she was telling the truth

959
00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:45.385
and I think we'll learn more just by walking

960
00:51:45.385 --> 00:51:47.632
this place at this point.

961
00:51:47.632 --> 00:51:49.118
TRAVIS: I mean, we're going to learn.

962
00:51:49.118 --> 00:51:52.341
I know that I talked to a 1200 year old drow

963
00:51:52.341 --> 00:51:54.806
that's been a fucking million different people

964
00:51:54.806 --> 00:51:59.139
and a goblin that was probably 999,000 people.

965
00:52:00.313 --> 00:52:04.045
Like, fuck. Who knows what we're in the middle of now?

966
00:52:04.045 --> 00:52:05.136
TALIESIN: I know, it's exciting.

967
00:52:05.136 --> 00:52:07.236
TRAVIS: It is exciting, it is.

968
00:52:07.236 --> 00:52:09.652
MARISHA: Well.

969
00:52:09.652 --> 00:52:14.647
Regardless, I think we all need direction amongst us, maybe.

970
00:52:14.647 --> 00:52:17.159
Kind of have a feeling like our

971
00:52:17.159 --> 00:52:19.632
current plan of pissing in the wind and then

972
00:52:19.632 --> 00:52:22.490
using that to decide our direction might not work

973
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.454
so much anymore.

974
00:52:25.454 --> 00:52:30.454
TALIEISN: The Wildmother spoke to me while I was in the cave

975
00:52:30.457 --> 00:52:34.366
and she thinks we're going the right direction.

976
00:52:34.366 --> 00:52:36.050
LAURA: See, everything's good.

977
00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:39.438
MARISHA: And what direction is that?

978
00:52:39.438 --> 00:52:41.134
LAURA: Toward the piss.

979
00:52:41.134 --> 00:52:44.350
TALIESIN: (laughs)

980
00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:49.350
Toward the piss, metaphorically speaking.

981
00:52:49.881 --> 00:52:53.447
We're going to where we're needed, our destiny awaits.

982
00:52:53.447 --> 00:52:57.242
LIAM: I am disappointed to part with our toy.

983
00:52:57.242 --> 00:52:59.585
There was a lot that I wished to learn about it,

984
00:52:59.585 --> 00:53:02.993
but let's be honest, there was not much of a plan for it.

985
00:53:02.993 --> 00:53:04.593
We did not have much of a plan.

986
00:53:04.593 --> 00:53:05.426
I am--

987
00:53:05.426 --> 00:53:06.984
TALIESIN: We're now in the place

988
00:53:06.984 --> 00:53:09.733
where any writings that exist on it would be.

989
00:53:09.733 --> 00:53:13.362
MARISHA: Speaking of not having any plans,

990
00:53:13.362 --> 00:53:15.399
I'm more disappointed in us.

991
00:53:15.399 --> 00:53:16.857
SAM: Why?

992
00:53:16.857 --> 00:53:20.942
MARISHA: We knew nothing of what we were getting into.

993
00:53:20.942 --> 00:53:23.090
We were asking questions to the people

994
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:24.814
we were trying to deceive,

995
00:53:24.814 --> 00:53:27.184
things that we should have already known.

996
00:53:27.184 --> 00:53:28.765
SAM: We're not good at this.

997
00:53:28.765 --> 00:53:30.625
MARISHA: We can be better at it, though.

998
00:53:30.625 --> 00:53:32.295
I'm actually pretty good at it.

999
00:53:32.295 --> 00:53:34.928
LAURA: Well, yeah, but you were trained in it.

1000
00:53:34.928 --> 00:53:37.772
You know, we're just a couple of people

1001
00:53:37.772 --> 00:53:41.306
that were wandering around and found you guys and--

1002
00:53:41.306 --> 00:53:43.700
MARISHA: I was trained in it, you're right.

1003
00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.834
LAURA: Yeah.

1004
00:53:45.834 --> 00:53:47.531
TRAVIS: What would you have done differently?

1005
00:53:47.531 --> 00:53:50.528
How would you have learned about them?

1006
00:53:50.528 --> 00:53:53.179
LIAM: Everywhere that we went, you and I were not welcome.

1007
00:53:53.179 --> 00:53:54.656
MARISHA: Exactly.

1008
00:53:54.656 --> 00:53:56.802
TRAVIS: They seem to be pretty guarded in their secrets

1009
00:53:56.802 --> 00:53:59.779
and their rituals and their relics.

1010
00:53:59.779 --> 00:54:04.208
MARISHA: It's no one's fault; it was just circumstantial.

1011
00:54:04.208 --> 00:54:05.840
And I'm not agreeing to the slave thing anymore

1012
00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.223
because that was stupid.

1013
00:54:07.223 --> 00:54:08.632
LAURA: Yeah, sorry about that.

1014
00:54:08.632 --> 00:54:10.163
TRAVIS: But you were so convincing.

1015
00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:11.429
I mean it, really--

1016
00:54:11.429 --> 00:54:12.420
MARISHA: Fuck you, Fjord.

1017
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.170
TRAVIS: All right, fair enough, no more of that.

1018
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:16.673
LAURA: Some people are really into that stuff,

1019
00:54:16.673 --> 00:54:18.568
I'm just putting it out there.

1020
00:54:18.568 --> 00:54:19.987
SAM: Have you seen that?

1021
00:54:19.987 --> 00:54:21.494
LAURA: I've seen some of it.

1022
00:54:21.494 --> 00:54:23.240
MARISHA: Under different circumstances,

1023
00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.845
it might have been enjoyable. In a

1024
00:54:25.845 --> 00:54:28.503
place where it was literally robbing me of my voice,

1025
00:54:28.503 --> 00:54:29.336
not super cool.

1026
00:54:29.336 --> 00:54:32.603
LAURA: I get it, that's not cool at all.

1027
00:54:32.603 --> 00:54:36.204
Sorry I put my feet on your back.

1028
00:54:36.204 --> 00:54:37.662
MARISHA: It was a little funny.

1029
00:54:37.662 --> 00:54:38.651
It was a little funny.

1030
00:54:38.651 --> 00:54:43.218
TALIESIN: I don't remember that.

1031
00:54:43.218 --> 00:54:47.071
LIAM: I'll tell you what, though.

1032
00:54:47.071 --> 00:54:51.929
The first time in a very long time, I feel

1033
00:54:51.929 --> 00:54:53.826
hopeful.

1034
00:54:53.826 --> 00:54:56.505
LAURA: You look like you feel hopeful, Caleb.

1035
00:54:56.505 --> 00:55:00.314
(laughter)

1036
00:55:01.324 --> 00:55:03.686
(clapping)

1037
00:55:03.686 --> 00:55:07.139
TRAVIS: Keep the frown on, keep the frown, don't break!

1038
00:55:07.139 --> 00:55:09.953
LIAM: I'm not breaking.

1039
00:55:09.953 --> 00:55:12.159
I think it's going to be hell on earth for us

1040
00:55:12.159 --> 00:55:14.230
to try to go back to the Empire.

1041
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:16.354
I assume everything that was said in that room

1042
00:55:16.354 --> 00:55:18.235
is going back to Wildemount,

1043
00:55:18.235 --> 00:55:20.649
going back to the Cerberus Assembly.

1044
00:55:20.649 --> 00:55:22.819
My goose is cooked.

1045
00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.395
LAURA: I think you're right.

1046
00:55:24.395 --> 00:55:26.152
I think I'm going to have a very hard time

1047
00:55:26.152 --> 00:55:29.211
finding my father now because of this.

1048
00:55:29.211 --> 00:55:31.694
I don't know if I'll ever see my mom again

1049
00:55:31.694 --> 00:55:36.136
because the choices made in that room.

1050
00:55:36.136 --> 00:55:37.642
LIAM: If you want to see your mother,

1051
00:55:37.642 --> 00:55:42.507
I can get you back to your mother pretty soon.

1052
00:55:42.507 --> 00:55:45.507
MARISHA: Jester has a point, though.

1053
00:55:50.512 --> 00:55:54.895
Kind of goes for a lot of us.

1054
00:55:54.895 --> 00:55:59.895
LIAM: But we have, if we play it right,

1055
00:56:00.424 --> 00:56:03.027
very strong allies,

1056
00:56:03.027 --> 00:56:07.472
and things that were impossible yesterday

1057
00:56:07.472 --> 00:56:09.631
are possible today.

1058
00:56:09.631 --> 00:56:11.789
TRAVIS: This is true.

1059
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:12.751
MARISHA: It is true.

1060
00:56:12.751 --> 00:56:17.751
It just depends on what type of possible you're looking for.

1061
00:56:19.001 --> 00:56:23.176
I think your allies here

1062
00:56:23.176 --> 00:56:27.512
are owed a little bit more of an explanation, Hope-Bringer.

1063
00:56:27.512 --> 00:56:28.772
LIAM: Not in this room.

1064
00:56:28.772 --> 00:56:30.356
TRAVIS: I was going to say the same.

1065
00:56:30.356 --> 00:56:32.368
Maybe we should save this for a bit later.

1066
00:56:32.368 --> 00:56:35.092
We should be celebrating the good news

1067
00:56:35.092 --> 00:56:37.784
that we're going to recover Yeza.

1068
00:56:37.784 --> 00:56:39.469
LAURA: That's true.

1069
00:56:39.469 --> 00:56:42.112
SAM: She didn't say that we could take,

1070
00:56:42.112 --> 00:56:43.520
she just said see.

1071
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.904
LAURA: She said maybe. Maybe.

1072
00:56:45.904 --> 00:56:49.437
TALIESIN: At least argue for conditions.

1073
00:56:49.437 --> 00:56:53.520
SAM: I have to admit, I'm excited about that, but

1074
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.370
it was a possibility that I did not think was real-ish.

1075
00:56:59.485 --> 00:57:02.929
So I'm also now kind of nervous.

1076
00:57:02.929 --> 00:57:04.138
LAURA: Has he seen you like this?

1077
00:57:04.138 --> 00:57:05.888
SAM: Nope.

1078
00:57:05.888 --> 00:57:08.518
LAURA: Ooh.
TRAVIS: Oh, not at all?

1079
00:57:08.518 --> 00:57:10.129
SAM: Mm-mm, nope.

1080
00:57:10.129 --> 00:57:11.453
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Would it be helpful

1081
00:57:11.453 --> 00:57:15.744
if, when you first spoke to him,

1082
00:57:15.744 --> 00:57:18.553
you looked like you used to?

1083
00:57:18.553 --> 00:57:20.064
SAM: Of course.

1084
00:57:20.064 --> 00:57:21.410
LIAM: We could do that.

1085
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:26.394
SAM: Yes, but for how long?

1086
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:30.543
TALIESIN: Is it possible that, perhaps, this is a bandage

1087
00:57:30.543 --> 00:57:33.577
that should be pulled at some point?

1088
00:57:33.577 --> 00:57:36.927
SAM: Oh, I don't know. I mean,

1089
00:57:36.927 --> 00:57:39.292
it's a rough scab.

1090
00:57:39.292 --> 00:57:40.125
TALIEISN: It's not going to heal right--

1091
00:57:40.125 --> 00:57:41.883
SAM: It doesn't look good.

1092
00:57:41.883 --> 00:57:44.108
TRAVIS: You know your husband.

1093
00:57:44.108 --> 00:57:49.040
You have a child together.

1094
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.975
LAURA: Does he hate goblins as much as you did?

1095
00:57:50.975 --> 00:57:53.867
SAM: Oh, yeah.

1096
00:57:53.867 --> 00:57:58.386
Yeah, they're awful.

1097
00:57:58.386 --> 00:58:01.018
LIAM: You know what might soften the blow a little bit?

1098
00:58:01.018 --> 00:58:03.311
SAM: Alcohol?

1099
00:58:03.311 --> 00:58:05.711
LIAM: Freedom.

1100
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:06.928
SAM: True.

1101
00:58:06.928 --> 00:58:08.992
LAURA: What if I sent him a message and let him know,

1102
00:58:08.992 --> 00:58:13.022
hey, P.S., she doesn't look quite like you remember her,

1103
00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.291
but, you know, she's still your wife,

1104
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:16.338
she loves you very much, and stuff.

1105
00:58:16.338 --> 00:58:18.659
TRAVIS: Actually, that's not a terrible idea, yeah.

1106
00:58:18.659 --> 00:58:19.807
LAURA: That way he's expecting something.

1107
00:58:19.807 --> 00:58:21.344
TRAVIS: Just prep it, just a bit.

1108
00:58:21.344 --> 00:58:23.527
Just plant the seed, let it grow.

1109
00:58:23.527 --> 00:58:26.123
LAURA: Or, or, or we can totally transform you

1110
00:58:26.123 --> 00:58:27.593
and he never has to know.

1111
00:58:27.593 --> 00:58:29.505
We'll just consistently keep casting

1112
00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:32.104
this spell on you and stuff.

1113
00:58:32.104 --> 00:58:34.311
Forever.

1114
00:58:34.311 --> 00:58:37.441
SAM: That seems labor intensive.

1115
00:58:37.441 --> 00:58:38.861
LAURA: It'll use a lot of magic,

1116
00:58:38.861 --> 00:58:41.474
but we're willing to do it for you.

1117
00:58:41.474 --> 00:58:43.350
TALIESIN: And you'll never be alone in a room again.

1118
00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:45.413
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1119
00:58:45.413 --> 00:58:47.904
SAM: That would make lovemaking very difficult.

1120
00:58:47.904 --> 00:58:51.646
(laughter)

1121
00:58:52.652 --> 00:58:55.249
I guess we could give him a little heads up,

1122
00:58:55.249 --> 00:58:57.400
although I don't know when we're going to see him.

1123
00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.278
Is it now,

1124
00:58:58.278 --> 00:58:59.566
is it five minutes from now?

1125
00:58:59.566 --> 00:59:01.624
Do we have to travel across the country to see him?

1126
00:59:01.624 --> 00:59:04.091
LAURA: I think he's probably downstairs, or something.

1127
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:05.727
SAM: Are we in-- where are we?

1128
00:59:05.727 --> 00:59:07.042
Are we in Ghor Dranas right now?

1129
00:59:07.042 --> 00:59:09.264
LIAM: Rosohna in Ghor Dranas.

1130
00:59:09.264 --> 00:59:10.225
SAM: How did that happen?

1131
00:59:10.225 --> 00:59:13.317
MARISHA: No, Rosohna is Ghor Dranas.

1132
00:59:13.317 --> 00:59:14.424
LAURA: Just a different name.

1133
00:59:14.424 --> 00:59:15.655
MARISHA: Rosohna is their name for it,

1134
00:59:15.655 --> 00:59:18.476
Ghor Dranas is our bastardized name for it.

1135
00:59:18.476 --> 00:59:20.086
SAM: Oh.

1136
00:59:20.086 --> 00:59:20.966
MARISHA: Right?

1137
00:59:20.966 --> 00:59:23.454
TRAVIS: Remember we took a teleportation circle.

1138
00:59:23.454 --> 00:59:26.910
MATT: Yeah, Ghor Dranas is the name for the location

1139
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:28.969
as it was the capital for the Betrayer Gods

1140
00:59:28.969 --> 00:59:32.103
during the Calamity up to the Divergence.

1141
00:59:32.103 --> 00:59:34.927
LAURA: They don't want it to be Betrayer Gods anymore.

1142
00:59:34.927 --> 00:59:37.685
TRAVIS: Oh boy. Oh gosh.

1143
00:59:37.685 --> 00:59:39.143
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1144
00:59:39.143 --> 00:59:44.064
MATT: See, that's just extra, that's extra info.

1145
00:59:46.009 --> 00:59:47.973
MARISHA: Just straight intelligence?

1146
00:59:47.973 --> 00:59:49.273
MATT: Yeah.

1147
00:59:50.185 --> 00:59:51.018
MARISHA: Eight.

1148
00:59:51.018 --> 00:59:52.294
MATT: Okay, no worries.

1149
00:59:52.294 --> 00:59:53.510
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

1150
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:55.243
MATT: Just curious.

1151
00:59:57.110 --> 01:00:00.058
SAM: Yeah, maybe give him a headsy.

1152
01:00:00.058 --> 01:00:02.716
TALIESIN: You're nervous about where we are?

1153
01:00:02.716 --> 01:00:04.407
TRAVIS: I mean, the former capital

1154
01:00:04.407 --> 01:00:08.241
of where the Betrayer Gods were during the Calamity.

1155
01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:09.255
SAM: I don't even know what that is.

1156
01:00:09.255 --> 01:00:12.061
Are those important figures?

1157
01:00:12.061 --> 01:00:13.237
TRAVIS: I mean, they weren't good.

1158
01:00:13.237 --> 01:00:15.345
Betrayer is inherently bad, right?

1159
01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:16.594
SAM: But then they changed the name,

1160
01:00:16.594 --> 01:00:18.202
so maybe they didn't like them either.

1161
01:00:18.202 --> 01:00:19.839
TRAVIS: Yep, just total rebrand.

1162
01:00:19.839 --> 01:00:22.077
I'm sure there was nothing left behind after that.

1163
01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:25.057
LAURA: I mean, don't judge people based on,

1164
01:00:25.057 --> 01:00:27.935
you know, their parents. Some people--

1165
01:00:27.935 --> 01:00:29.535
TRAVIS: Yes, absolutely.

1166
01:00:29.535 --> 01:00:34.045
I'm just suspicious, that's all.

1167
01:00:34.045 --> 01:00:35.352
LAURA: Understandable,

1168
01:00:35.352 --> 01:00:38.188
but I think the Bright Queen was pretty cool.

1169
01:00:38.188 --> 01:00:41.488
TRAVIS: This version of the Bright Queen.

1170
01:00:41.488 --> 01:00:43.136
SAM: What does that mean?

1171
01:00:43.136 --> 01:00:45.929
LAURA: That you mean she's got 1200 lifetimes, well,

1172
01:00:45.929 --> 01:00:49.073
no, that would be very short lives.

1173
01:00:49.073 --> 01:00:53.026
TALIESIN: He was a fan of the previous Doctor Who series.

1174
01:00:53.026 --> 01:00:55.957
TRAVIS: Fuck you, and yes.

1175
01:00:55.957 --> 01:00:57.848
LIAM: From what I've read, she could also probably

1176
01:00:57.848 --> 01:01:00.732
have killed us all herself without any help.

1177
01:01:00.732 --> 01:01:04.213
LAURA: Yeah, she's really strong, I would assume.

1178
01:01:04.213 --> 01:01:05.273
SAM: I don't know, you're pretty good.

1179
01:01:05.273 --> 01:01:06.542
You could have done Wall of Fire.

1180
01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:11.014
LIAM: Over a thousand years of training is pretty top notch.

1181
01:01:11.014 --> 01:01:12.702
LAURA: Wow.

1182
01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:14.910
No wonder her armor is cool.

1183
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:17.122
TRAVIS: How about we let him know that we'll

1184
01:01:17.122 --> 01:01:18.315
feel free to move--
LAURA: I wonder if she would

1185
01:01:18.315 --> 01:01:21.748
give us some, like, armor or diamonds or, like,

1186
01:01:21.748 --> 01:01:23.557
gem dust, or something?

1187
01:01:23.557 --> 01:01:25.079
TALIESIN: I would not say no to another diamond.

1188
01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:28.809
SAM: Should we go back and ask for stuff and for jewels now?

1189
01:01:28.809 --> 01:01:31.581
LIAM: Perhaps not directly to her, but--

1190
01:01:31.581 --> 01:01:33.119
TALIESIN: If they have work for us,

1191
01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:35.653
so we can maybe earn a little something and--

1192
01:01:35.653 --> 01:01:38.507
MARISHA: They mentioned Professor Waccoh.

1193
01:01:38.507 --> 01:01:40.331
TALIESIN: I feel like, perhaps,

1194
01:01:40.331 --> 01:01:42.039
if we start doing our good work here

1195
01:01:42.039 --> 01:01:43.625
things will manifest.

1196
01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:45.408
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending.

1197
01:01:45.408 --> 01:01:48.033
MATT: Okay.

1198
01:01:48.033 --> 01:01:49.651
TRAVIS: That pen is fucking dope, Jester.

1199
01:01:49.651 --> 01:01:50.850
TALIESIN: It's such a good pen.

1200
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:51.683
LAURA: Thanks.

1201
01:01:51.683 --> 01:01:53.743
I want to eat it, it's really hard

1202
01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:57.665
not to put it in my mouth.

1203
01:01:57.665 --> 01:01:59.421
On Yeza.

1204
01:01:59.421 --> 01:02:02.366
SAM: While she's casting, I'm going to start getting drunk.

1205
01:02:02.366 --> 01:02:03.199
MATT: Okay.

1206
01:02:03.199 --> 01:02:04.501
TRAVIS: No, no, no!

1207
01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:06.797
I pull whatever you're drinking down.

1208
01:02:06.797 --> 01:02:07.630
SAM: I need it!

1209
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:10.129
TRAVIS: No, you don't! (slapping) I smack her.

1210
01:02:10.129 --> 01:02:10.962
SAM: Ah!

1211
01:02:10.962 --> 01:02:11.828
TRAVIS: You don't need this!

1212
01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:13.328
You're all the woman you need to be.

1213
01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:17.857
SAM: You're so tall, but your slaps are so ineffectual!

1214
01:02:17.857 --> 01:02:20.689
It's like you have rubber wrists or something.

1215
01:02:20.689 --> 01:02:21.922
It did almost nothing to me.

1216
01:02:21.922 --> 01:02:23.005
TRAVIS: (slapping)

1217
01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:24.950
SAM: Nothing at all!

1218
01:02:27.975 --> 01:02:30.808
How do you even hold the falchion?

1219
01:02:31.755 --> 01:02:33.005
TRAVIS: (crying)

1220
01:02:33.005 --> 01:02:36.191
LAURA: Oh, no. Don't make Fjord cry.

1221
01:02:36.191 --> 01:02:37.909
TALIESIN: You made fun of his tennis wrist, come on.

1222
01:02:37.909 --> 01:02:39.282
SAM: Let me drink my drink!

1223
01:02:39.282 --> 01:02:40.115
LAURA: No.

1224
01:02:40.115 --> 01:02:41.317
SAM: I'm scared.

1225
01:02:41.317 --> 01:02:43.399
LAURA: Yes, but you love him.

1226
01:02:43.399 --> 01:02:46.056
You don't want to be drunk the first time you see him again.

1227
01:02:46.056 --> 01:02:48.336
SAM: I was drunk the first time we--

1228
01:02:48.336 --> 01:02:52.027
TRAVIS: Okay, all right, well.

1229
01:02:53.068 --> 01:02:54.068
SAM: All right.

1230
01:02:55.988 --> 01:02:57.487
I won't get drunk.

1231
01:02:57.487 --> 01:03:00.212
LAURA: Guess what?

1232
01:03:00.212 --> 01:03:05.168
We're here!

1233
01:03:05.168 --> 01:03:07.586
But

1234
01:03:07.586 --> 01:03:10.561
Nott needs to let you know she looks a little different.

1235
01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:13.790
SAM: My name's not--

1236
01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.907
LAURA: What was your name again?

1237
01:03:14.907 --> 01:03:16.123
SAM: Veth.

1238
01:03:16.123 --> 01:03:19.165
LAURA: Veth is Nott.

1239
01:03:19.165 --> 01:03:20.804
SAM: That's confusing.

1240
01:03:22.527 --> 01:03:26.022
LAURA: She still loves you, okay.

1241
01:03:26.022 --> 01:03:27.411
Oh!

1242
01:03:27.411 --> 01:03:29.990
(laughter)

1243
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:32.489
TRAVIS: Go on. It's 25, right?

1244
01:03:32.489 --> 01:03:33.827
MATT: You don't have to use all the words.

1245
01:03:33.827 --> 01:03:36.327
LAURA: I want to--
LIAM: Don't say that!

1246
01:03:38.154 --> 01:03:39.785
LAURA: We're on our way.

1247
01:03:39.785 --> 01:03:41.064
TRAVIS: We're on our way, you got it.

1248
01:03:41.064 --> 01:03:43.214
ALL: Yay!

1249
01:03:43.214 --> 01:03:46.380
SAM: Veth is Nott.

1250
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.186
What?

1251
01:03:48.186 --> 01:03:51.245
LAURA: Wait, I'm waiting.

1252
01:03:53.507 --> 01:03:55.790
MATT: "Veth is here?

1253
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:59.562
"What?!

1254
01:04:05.005 --> 01:04:08.930
"Are you being serious?

1255
01:04:10.765 --> 01:04:15.765
"I guess you can't say.

1256
01:04:16.246 --> 01:04:17.629
"Thank you."

1257
01:04:17.629 --> 01:04:18.737
And that's it.

1258
01:04:18.737 --> 01:04:22.459
LAURA: Aww, he seemed really excited to see you.

1259
01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:24.270
Also, kind of confused.

1260
01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:25.765
SAM: Maybe I should get drunk.

1261
01:04:25.765 --> 01:04:28.324
LAURA: Maybe we should cast it on you.

1262
01:04:28.324 --> 01:04:29.602
SAM: Cast what on me?

1263
01:04:29.602 --> 01:04:30.947
LAURA: Polymorph or something?

1264
01:04:30.947 --> 01:04:33.701
SAM: Polymorph, you want to make me a griffin or something?

1265
01:04:33.701 --> 01:04:35.112
LAURA: Oh, can't we make you look like you used to?

1266
01:04:35.112 --> 01:04:36.981
SAM: I can make me look like that.

1267
01:04:36.981 --> 01:04:38.558
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

1268
01:04:38.558 --> 01:04:43.246
The thing is, if we cast a physical spell on you,

1269
01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:46.379
then when he touches you, you'll still feel like you.

1270
01:04:46.379 --> 01:04:47.777
But if you cast disguise on you,

1271
01:04:47.777 --> 01:04:49.008
then when he touches you, he'll know

1272
01:04:49.008 --> 01:04:51.195
that you have these ears and stuff.

1273
01:04:51.195 --> 01:04:53.380
MARISHA: It's like dipping your toe in the water

1274
01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.787
before you fully jump in.

1275
01:04:54.787 --> 01:04:59.112
It might be nice to ease him into it.

1276
01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:00.714
SAM: How do you do that?

1277
01:05:00.714 --> 01:05:03.921
MARISHA: You turn yourself into you and be like,

1278
01:05:03.921 --> 01:05:07.455
"So I have a thing."

1279
01:05:07.455 --> 01:05:10.438
Or maybe even introduce through touch first,

1280
01:05:10.438 --> 01:05:11.634
you know, one--

1281
01:05:11.634 --> 01:05:12.467
LAURA: That's good, that's cool.

1282
01:05:12.467 --> 01:05:15.817
MARISHA: One sensory overload at a time.

1283
01:05:15.817 --> 01:05:17.175
SAM: Okay, okay.

1284
01:05:17.175 --> 01:05:18.357
TRAVIS: Yep.

1285
01:05:18.357 --> 01:05:19.190
SAM: Okay.

1286
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:20.023
LIAM: You're just going to

1287
01:05:20.023 --> 01:05:23.827
slowly turn up the temperature on the situation.

1288
01:05:23.827 --> 01:05:25.452
TRAVIS: Just a hand.
LIAM: Ease him in.

1289
01:05:25.452 --> 01:05:26.697
TRAVIS: And then an arm.

1290
01:05:26.697 --> 01:05:28.369
And then an ear.

1291
01:05:28.369 --> 01:05:30.066
And then like, your lower jaw.

1292
01:05:30.066 --> 01:05:31.871
LAURA: Big ol' goblin titty.

1293
01:05:31.871 --> 01:05:36.521
(laughter)

1294
01:05:38.889 --> 01:05:39.899
SAM: All right.

1295
01:05:39.899 --> 01:05:42.074
You guys'll just be creepily watching all this happen?

1296
01:05:42.074 --> 01:05:44.250
TRAVIS: Yep, I wouldn't miss this for the world.

1297
01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:45.998
We're ready to go.

1298
01:05:45.998 --> 01:05:46.868
MARISHA: It's like a proposal video.

1299
01:05:46.868 --> 01:05:47.996
We're going to be filming it.

1300
01:05:47.996 --> 01:05:49.388
LAURA: Cast yourself.

1301
01:05:49.388 --> 01:05:51.235
SAM: Oh, it's happening, we're doing this. All right.

1302
01:05:51.235 --> 01:05:52.403
LAURA: Or should you do it when we get closer

1303
01:05:52.403 --> 01:05:53.887
because it lasts for what, an hour?

1304
01:05:53.887 --> 01:05:56.321
SAM: Let's ask Mr. Essek.

1305
01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:59.779
MATT: The doors open and the Shadowhand is standing there.

1306
01:05:59.779 --> 01:06:00.946
"Are you ready?"

1307
01:06:02.106 --> 01:06:05.084
TRAVIS: Man, that was so dramatic.

1308
01:06:05.084 --> 01:06:06.818
I believe we are.

1309
01:06:06.818 --> 01:06:09.318
LAURA: How far away is the dungeon?

1310
01:06:10.637 --> 01:06:14.044
MATT: "I'd say about, by foot, an hour's travel at most."

1311
01:06:14.044 --> 01:06:15.350
LAURA: Okay, so maybe wait just a minute.

1312
01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.189
SAM: I will.
LAURA: Okay.

1313
01:06:17.189 --> 01:06:19.097
MATT: "Very well, follow me." He turns around.

1314
01:06:19.097 --> 01:06:20.205
MARISHA: Can we do an insight check

1315
01:06:20.205 --> 01:06:24.108
on him and make sure that this guy's not going to turn on us

1316
01:06:24.108 --> 01:06:26.600
and just throw us in jail and be like, "Fuck you guys."

1317
01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.408
MATT: Sure, make an insight check.

1318
01:06:28.408 --> 01:06:32.838
LAURA: Good thing I can cast the Sending on Leylas.

1319
01:06:32.838 --> 01:06:35.748
MARISHA: Okay, I got to remember my stats again.

1320
01:06:35.748 --> 01:06:37.548
23.

1321
01:06:39.676 --> 01:06:44.676
LAURA: Oh no, he's definitely planning something.

1322
01:06:44.723 --> 01:06:48.978
SAM: Guys, D&amp;D Beyond will be in Denver.

1323
01:06:48.978 --> 01:06:51.342
That is not true!

1324
01:06:51.342 --> 01:06:52.364
That was a mistake!

1325
01:06:52.364 --> 01:06:53.881
They are everywhere, though,

1326
01:06:53.881 --> 01:06:56.482
everywhere that you have your tablet device

1327
01:06:56.482 --> 01:06:58.615
and a login.

1328
01:06:58.615 --> 01:06:59.498
LIAM: Among other places.

1329
01:06:59.498 --> 01:07:02.692
SAM: Yeah, you can get D&amp;D Beyond in any nation of the world

1330
01:07:02.692 --> 01:07:06.077
as long you have access to internet and

1331
01:07:06.077 --> 01:07:10.766
an excitement for the joys of D&amp;D.

1332
01:07:10.766 --> 01:07:13.691
MATT: There we go. All right.

1333
01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:18.454
"Very well, follow me."

1334
01:07:18.454 --> 01:07:21.627
He turns around and continues to walk. "Now--"

1335
01:07:21.627 --> 01:07:23.718
MARISHA: Fuck it, seems legit.

1336
01:07:25.805 --> 01:07:27.788
MATT: Leading you through the long hallway

1337
01:07:27.788 --> 01:07:30.210
which you entered, but passing onto the opposite end,

1338
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:32.610
walking for hundreds of feet amidst this

1339
01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:37.610
massive, awe-inspiring, cathedral-like interior.

1340
01:07:37.771 --> 01:07:41.864
The doors open and lead you immediately outside.

1341
01:07:41.864 --> 01:07:45.884
The scent of embers and crisp night air hit your nose

1342
01:07:45.884 --> 01:07:47.956
as you see the dark of night above you,

1343
01:07:47.956 --> 01:07:52.110
though the timing of the day should be daytime.

1344
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:55.516
You know this very specifically.

1345
01:07:55.516 --> 01:08:00.499
You look up to a dark sky, stars visible.

1346
01:08:02.068 --> 01:08:04.539
It's curious, but comfortable, not too chill.

1347
01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:05.458
TRAVIS: Stars visible?

1348
01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:06.291
MATT: Yeah.

1349
01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.949
LAURA: Why is it so dark outside?

1350
01:08:08.949 --> 01:08:12.101
MATT: "Oh, that's right, you're not from around here.

1351
01:08:12.101 --> 01:08:16.926
"For most of us, sunlight can be a bit of a bother.

1352
01:08:18.411 --> 01:08:23.411
"While we do have periods of worship in which we

1353
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.825
"give ourselves to the sunlight as part of our

1354
01:08:27.825 --> 01:08:30.678
"means of showing our faith,

1355
01:08:30.678 --> 01:08:32.988
"it does impede our day-to-day business.

1356
01:08:32.988 --> 01:08:37.406
"So as part of our craft, we've found a way to

1357
01:08:37.406 --> 01:08:40.467
"keep it at bay, for as long as we'd like."

1358
01:08:40.467 --> 01:08:42.100
LIAM: How high does this darkness rise?

1359
01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.085
MATT: "About a mile."

1360
01:08:44.085 --> 01:08:45.945
LIAM: That is fascinating.

1361
01:08:45.945 --> 01:08:49.261
MATT: "Oh, there's so much more. Come."

1362
01:08:49.261 --> 01:08:51.144
TALIESIN: The correct stars, in the sky?

1363
01:08:51.144 --> 01:08:52.494
MATT: "It's where they would be."

1364
01:08:52.494 --> 01:08:54.232
TALIESIN: All right.

1365
01:08:54.232 --> 01:08:56.364
MATT: "It's as if there was no sun at all above you."

1366
01:08:56.364 --> 01:08:59.464
TALIESIN: So not a different sky. It's this sky.

1367
01:08:59.464 --> 01:09:01.364
MATT: "It's this sky.

1368
01:09:01.364 --> 01:09:05.880
"Just through a lens of dunamantic magic."

1369
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.733
TRAVIS: What do we call you, just Shadowhand?

1370
01:09:08.733 --> 01:09:11.453
Or is there another name you prefer?

1371
01:09:11.453 --> 01:09:13.751
MATT: "Shadowhand Essek Thelyss."

1372
01:09:13.751 --> 01:09:15.962
TRAVIS: Essek Thelyss.

1373
01:09:15.962 --> 01:09:17.728
MATT: "Of Den Thelyss."

1374
01:09:17.728 --> 01:09:19.080
SAM: Sure, we know it well.

1375
01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.449
LAURA: Den Thelyss is, like, the most popular one.

1376
01:09:21.449 --> 01:09:23.535
SAM: That's one of the top three, is that right?

1377
01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:26.786
MATT: "It is indeed."

1378
01:09:26.786 --> 01:09:31.786
TRAVIS: Is it impolite, forgive me if it is, to ask

1379
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:37.209
how many years you have been through the bop-bop beacon?

1380
01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.879
MATT: "Interestingly enough,

1381
01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:45.874
"while I am consecuted, I have not

1382
01:09:45.874 --> 01:09:47.536
"gone beyond the first life yet."

1383
01:09:47.536 --> 01:09:48.469
TRAVIS: Ah.

1384
01:09:48.469 --> 01:09:51.200
MATT: "I am what you refer to as a prodigy of dunamancy.

1385
01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.947
"The den was very kind to accept me

1386
01:09:54.947 --> 01:09:57.921
"for one as comparably young as myself,

1387
01:09:57.921 --> 01:10:01.148
"I'm only partway into my second century, so."

1388
01:10:01.148 --> 01:10:03.551
LIAM: It would be a great honor.

1389
01:10:03.551 --> 01:10:04.384
MATT: "It is.

1390
01:10:05.858 --> 01:10:07.048
"Anyway.

1391
01:10:07.048 --> 01:10:11.725
"Come, we have a prison to show you to."

1392
01:10:11.725 --> 01:10:15.531
As he turns, you can now see before you,

1393
01:10:15.531 --> 01:10:20.110
throughout the vicinity, this beautiful courtyard

1394
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:23.610
of subtle gray and green bushes and trees.

1395
01:10:25.453 --> 01:10:26.827
You see that you're on a hill.

1396
01:10:26.827 --> 01:10:29.408
The center of the city seems to be on some sort of hilltop

1397
01:10:29.408 --> 01:10:32.299
and looking down, you can see the perimeter wall,

1398
01:10:32.299 --> 01:10:36.413
made of a dull gray with a purplish-tint type stone

1399
01:10:36.413 --> 01:10:39.158
and across the crest of it, you see these green lanterns

1400
01:10:39.158 --> 01:10:43.150
that alight with this soft, green glow.

1401
01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:47.195
Beyond that, beyond the barricades,

1402
01:10:47.195 --> 01:10:51.899
your vision stretches out to see the entirety, it seems,

1403
01:10:51.899 --> 01:10:56.899
of Rosohna, this incredible, vast metropolis,

1404
01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:03.100
alit with thousands of the same little, green lantern glows.

1405
01:11:04.752 --> 01:11:07.661
You see stone and metal and dark clay

1406
01:11:07.661 --> 01:11:10.782
making up all the structures in various sizes and shapes,

1407
01:11:10.782 --> 01:11:12.379
some of which have been repurposed ruins of old

1408
01:11:12.379 --> 01:11:15.237
that have been built upon and refurbished,

1409
01:11:15.237 --> 01:11:17.169
some of which, at least closer to the center,

1410
01:11:17.169 --> 01:11:22.164
appear to be extensions of an elvish, domicile design

1411
01:11:22.164 --> 01:11:25.893
that is familiar yet unfamiliar,

1412
01:11:25.893 --> 01:11:29.802
in some ways slender and jagged, but beautiful and sleek.

1413
01:11:29.802 --> 01:11:31.347
Then, beyond that, you can see

1414
01:11:31.347 --> 01:11:34.583
extending wards of the city that tend to be a little more

1415
01:11:34.583 --> 01:11:36.104
patchwork and scattered.

1416
01:11:36.104 --> 01:11:38.491
You can see distant bonfires that are lit

1417
01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:40.604
in some of the streets, giving distinct orange glows

1418
01:11:40.604 --> 01:11:43.838
that break up the rest of the green, sparkling lights

1419
01:11:43.838 --> 01:11:48.317
that make up the entirety of your vision.

1420
01:11:48.317 --> 01:11:50.800
It's beautiful.

1421
01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.301
In the district beyond you, you can see broken spires

1422
01:11:53.301 --> 01:11:58.253
of curved metal that have a more industrious feel to it.

1423
01:12:00.972 --> 01:12:02.794
You can see, well, you're guessing

1424
01:12:02.794 --> 01:12:04.267
it's probably the Firmaments,

1425
01:12:04.267 --> 01:12:07.441
the way that it's guiding you towards it.

1426
01:12:07.441 --> 01:12:11.648
Suddenly, you hear this screech go through the sky above

1427
01:12:11.648 --> 01:12:13.528
and you glance up and instinctually duck

1428
01:12:13.528 --> 01:12:16.707
and, in the dark night sky, you can see

1429
01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:20.239
a pack of ash-gray griffons passing overhead,

1430
01:12:20.239 --> 01:12:22.310
elements of Kryn armor affixed to their bodies.

1431
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:24.595
On top, you can see riders scanning the skies,

1432
01:12:24.595 --> 01:12:27.081
about 12 of them,

1433
01:12:27.081 --> 01:12:28.901
keeping watch over the vicinity.

1434
01:12:28.901 --> 01:12:33.298
TALIESIN: That's one each if we decided to.

1435
01:12:33.298 --> 01:12:36.223
MATT: Essek leads you beyond the outer perimeter

1436
01:12:36.223 --> 01:12:40.490
of this region and into this next area,

1437
01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:43.501
which he tells you, "Welcome to the Firmaments.

1438
01:12:43.501 --> 01:12:44.961
"This is the place of higher learning.

1439
01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:48.892
"This is where, well, based on what

1440
01:12:48.892 --> 01:12:52.031
"you have been talking about and your curiosity,

1441
01:12:52.031 --> 01:12:53.662
"perhaps you'll be returning to,

1442
01:12:53.662 --> 01:12:55.219
"maybe when this ordeal is done.

1443
01:12:55.219 --> 01:12:56.617
"Especially if you're looking for the professor.

1444
01:12:56.617 --> 01:12:59.626
"She is within the Marble Tomes Conservatory

1445
01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:03.834
"and should be a unique meeting of minds

1446
01:13:03.834 --> 01:13:07.161
"I would like to be present for.

1447
01:13:07.161 --> 01:13:09.845
"But this way."

1448
01:13:09.845 --> 01:13:12.651
Glides along and leads you to

1449
01:13:12.651 --> 01:13:15.710
a large, curving stairway between two intricate pillars

1450
01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:20.710
that digs beneath the ground, the path leading below.

1451
01:13:21.446 --> 01:13:24.250
As you follow suit, you can feel the

1452
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.854
cold temperature begin to get colder as you descend.

1453
01:13:26.854 --> 01:13:29.448
The sounds, just the echoing of the clacking of your feet

1454
01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:31.495
on the stone steps.

1455
01:13:31.495 --> 01:13:33.209
Each footfall getting seemingly louder

1456
01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:37.998
as the quiet that approaches gets more and more deafening.

1457
01:13:37.998 --> 01:13:39.921
Then echoes begin to fade.

1458
01:13:39.921 --> 01:13:42.017
About five minutes of travel down through this

1459
01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:46.222
very wide, curving spiral.

1460
01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:50.165
Until you open up into a grandiose, subterranean cavern.

1461
01:13:50.165 --> 01:13:54.032
You can see it's about a quarter mile across

1462
01:13:54.032 --> 01:13:55.742
in every direction and it appears

1463
01:13:55.742 --> 01:13:58.829
that some sort of a pillar that you've been

1464
01:13:58.829 --> 01:14:01.008
spiraling down towards and when you step out

1465
01:14:01.008 --> 01:14:03.672
and walk along the side, there are

1466
01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:05.901
three visible pillars that rise up

1467
01:14:05.901 --> 01:14:07.549
into the ceiling, which may be other ways of

1468
01:14:07.549 --> 01:14:10.693
traversing down to what you can only assume

1469
01:14:10.693 --> 01:14:13.089
is the Shadowshire.

1470
01:14:13.089 --> 01:14:16.362
Now, the rough-hewn ceilings above,

1471
01:14:16.362 --> 01:14:18.306
a couple hundred feet above you,

1472
01:14:18.306 --> 01:14:21.063
glow with a blue moss that fills in the nooks and crannies

1473
01:14:21.063 --> 01:14:23.896
between protruding bits of rough rock

1474
01:14:23.896 --> 01:14:28.896
and crystals and other bits of strange, exposed ore

1475
01:14:28.988 --> 01:14:31.337
that glimmers in the way that the soft glow

1476
01:14:31.337 --> 01:14:35.216
hits it in certain angles as you walk by.

1477
01:14:35.216 --> 01:14:37.281
The base of the cavern around you

1478
01:14:37.281 --> 01:14:40.995
is a surprisingly bustling new neighborhood

1479
01:14:40.995 --> 01:14:45.995
of stone and glass, lit with the same green lantern light.

1480
01:14:46.347 --> 01:14:48.056
The streets are filled with drow.

1481
01:14:48.056 --> 01:14:51.911
It seems primarily drow down here.

1482
01:14:51.911 --> 01:14:54.046
Essek leads you onward towards an iron structure.

1483
01:14:54.046 --> 01:14:56.921
You can see the faces of people nearby

1484
01:14:56.921 --> 01:15:01.450
watching as you pass, some of them with a look of discomfort

1485
01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:04.840
and surprise, others just genuine curiosity,

1486
01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.558
but they seem to not pay mind with Essek leading the pack.

1487
01:15:09.558 --> 01:15:11.268
Especially since he's leading you towards

1488
01:15:11.268 --> 01:15:14.550
an iron structure designed for a more daunting task,

1489
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:16.832
with its spiked, metallic railing

1490
01:15:16.832 --> 01:15:20.093
and burning braziers flanking the large front doors.

1491
01:15:20.093 --> 01:15:21.840
You imagine this is probably

1492
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.881
some sort of entrance towards the prisons leading to you.

1493
01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:27.814
That pathway you're taking

1494
01:15:27.814 --> 01:15:31.621
seems to set most of the nearby denizens at ease.

1495
01:15:31.621 --> 01:15:33.635
Essek wordlessly approaches the guard

1496
01:15:33.635 --> 01:15:35.490
before they open the doors before you,

1497
01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:40.490
the heavy metal grinding open as you step inside.

1498
01:15:41.106 --> 01:15:46.106
Immediately, the smell of very acrid iron type

1499
01:15:46.753 --> 01:15:48.720
scent hits your nose,

1500
01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.203
like oxidizing metal meets rotting citrus.

1501
01:15:53.203 --> 01:15:56.234
It's not a pleasant smell.

1502
01:15:56.234 --> 01:16:00.115
As you enter, you're whisked along.

1503
01:16:00.115 --> 01:16:01.632
It's strange.

1504
01:16:01.632 --> 01:16:04.408
You follow Essek and as you do,

1505
01:16:04.408 --> 01:16:08.638
you feel like your pace is quickened.

1506
01:16:08.638 --> 01:16:11.146
People pass by other guards, but they blur past,

1507
01:16:11.146 --> 01:16:13.441
like you're unable to necessarily focus.

1508
01:16:13.441 --> 01:16:17.833
Something is subtly influencing you

1509
01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:19.782
to make it difficult to really trace

1510
01:16:19.782 --> 01:16:21.603
the path you take to where you're going.

1511
01:16:21.603 --> 01:16:24.103
LAURA: Ooh, cool.

1512
01:16:25.945 --> 01:16:27.782
MATT: You're quickly whisked down another hallway

1513
01:16:27.782 --> 01:16:29.879
to another set of stairs.

1514
01:16:29.879 --> 01:16:34.548
The smell of iron now mixes with the smell of sweat.

1515
01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:37.239
And rot.

1516
01:16:37.239 --> 01:16:41.181
And dung.

1517
01:16:41.181 --> 01:16:43.217
You try and focus on the door you're being led through

1518
01:16:43.217 --> 01:16:44.975
and then (whooshes) you're ushered through it.

1519
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:48.159
You're moving under your own power, but almost not.

1520
01:16:48.159 --> 01:16:52.414
It's a strange experience.

1521
01:16:52.414 --> 01:16:54.860
LAURA: Essek, it feels really weird down here.

1522
01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.131
MATT: "As it should.

1523
01:16:56.131 --> 01:16:59.014
"You have not been here before."

1524
01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.564
LAURA: You're not going to, like, leave us down here

1525
01:17:00.564 --> 01:17:02.696
or something, are you?

1526
01:17:02.696 --> 01:17:03.936
MATT: "Was that part of the deal?"

1527
01:17:03.936 --> 01:17:04.819
LAURA: No.

1528
01:17:04.819 --> 01:17:07.335
MATT: (chuckles) He keeps walking.

1529
01:17:07.335 --> 01:17:10.646
TRAVIS: Do you not feel the same effects?

1530
01:17:10.646 --> 01:17:12.204
MATT: "No.

1531
01:17:12.204 --> 01:17:16.743
"Time is one of my specialties."

1532
01:17:16.743 --> 01:17:19.904
As you head down into this subterranean series of tunnels,

1533
01:17:19.904 --> 01:17:24.766
you pass by cells, iron bars and grates.

1534
01:17:24.766 --> 01:17:26.328
You can see off to the edges

1535
01:17:26.328 --> 01:17:28.050
what little bits of light there are

1536
01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:31.892
from these small, burning flames,

1537
01:17:31.892 --> 01:17:33.864
magically lit and perpetually crackling

1538
01:17:33.864 --> 01:17:36.774
up in their small, iron cages.

1539
01:17:36.774 --> 01:17:41.122
In the shadows, there look to be multiple figures,

1540
01:17:41.122 --> 01:17:44.989
some human, some ogre-ish,

1541
01:17:44.989 --> 01:17:49.757
with more reinforced bars,

1542
01:17:49.757 --> 01:17:54.757
drow, emaciated, beaten, who knows.

1543
01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.019
Not looking happy and healthy,

1544
01:17:57.019 --> 01:18:02.019
but then again, what good Dungeon of Penance would?

1545
01:18:03.351 --> 01:18:05.568
You go past another whirl of metal gates.

1546
01:18:05.568 --> 01:18:09.941
You suddenly stop before a cell.

1547
01:18:09.941 --> 01:18:11.637
Essek nods to a jailer across the way

1548
01:18:11.637 --> 01:18:12.713
that you didn't notice was there

1549
01:18:12.713 --> 01:18:14.957
and suddenly is standing on the opposite end

1550
01:18:14.957 --> 01:18:19.957
and he pulls out a ring of keys and (creaking)

1551
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:23.706
pulls the gate open and steps away.

1552
01:18:23.706 --> 01:18:25.130
Essek turns.

1553
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:27.518
"Well then, the prisoner is all yours."

1554
01:18:27.518 --> 01:18:29.822
SAM: Oh! Are we all in the room?

1555
01:18:29.822 --> 01:18:31.531
MATT: You all are standing outside of the cell.

1556
01:18:31.531 --> 01:18:32.665
The door is open.

1557
01:18:32.665 --> 01:18:35.289
TRAVIS: How long do we have?

1558
01:18:35.289 --> 01:18:36.714
MATT: "As much as you need."

1559
01:18:36.714 --> 01:18:41.089
TRAVIS: Thank you. How do we-- will you stay or do we call?

1560
01:18:41.089 --> 01:18:42.463
MATT: "Oh, I'll be right here."

1561
01:18:42.463 --> 01:18:43.537
TRAVIS: Excellent.

1562
01:18:43.537 --> 01:18:44.673
LAURA: Do we get to take him?

1563
01:18:44.673 --> 01:18:46.632
Do we leave with him, then?

1564
01:18:46.632 --> 01:18:47.465
MATT: "Depends."

1565
01:18:49.256 --> 01:18:52.035
SAM: Do we have to kill you to get him out of here?

1566
01:18:52.035 --> 01:18:54.812
MATT: "(laughs) I'd like to see you try.

1567
01:18:54.812 --> 01:18:56.503
"Uh, no.

1568
01:18:56.503 --> 01:18:57.777
"I get to decide."

1569
01:18:57.777 --> 01:19:00.482
LAURA: Oh!

1570
01:19:00.482 --> 01:19:02.578
LIAM: Are there specific criteria?

1571
01:19:02.578 --> 01:19:03.477
MAT: "Maybe."

1572
01:19:03.477 --> 01:19:04.870
TRAVISL That seems very fair.

1573
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:08.198
Our intentions are very simple.

1574
01:19:08.198 --> 01:19:11.326
LAURA: Essek, I really think that you're very handsome

1575
01:19:11.326 --> 01:19:15.582
and that you seem like a really cool guy

1576
01:19:15.582 --> 01:19:19.710
and I hope we can be friends and stuff.

1577
01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:21.098
MATT: "Thank you very much."

1578
01:19:21.098 --> 01:19:22.934
LAURA: You're welcome.

1579
01:19:22.934 --> 01:19:26.930
TRAVIS: Any other eyes down the hallway besides Shadowhand?

1580
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:28.953
MATT: There's the jailer, who's about 15 feet down that way

1581
01:19:28.953 --> 01:19:32.042
and resting in the back.

1582
01:19:32.042 --> 01:19:33.633
TRAVIS: Kryn armor, same sort of thing?

1583
01:19:33.633 --> 01:19:37.986
MATT: Actually, no, not classically battle-set Kryn armor,

1584
01:19:37.986 --> 01:19:40.522
simple leather armor.

1585
01:19:40.522 --> 01:19:44.183
Yeah, drow, but like a burly drow,

1586
01:19:44.183 --> 01:19:45.941
wearing a dark hood, sleeveless,

1587
01:19:45.941 --> 01:19:48.549
you see the arms are exposed, like a leather tunic

1588
01:19:48.549 --> 01:19:49.771
and then a hood that's affixed to it

1589
01:19:49.771 --> 01:19:52.613
that is also dark leather that is up currently.

1590
01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:53.446
He's sitting there,

1591
01:19:53.446 --> 01:19:55.304
leaning against the wall, facing forward,

1592
01:19:55.304 --> 01:19:56.530
occasionally glancing over

1593
01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:58.223
out of the corner of the eye to keep an eye on things

1594
01:19:58.223 --> 01:20:01.154
but that's it.

1595
01:20:01.154 --> 01:20:05.597
LIAM: I'm going to drop down to my knees in front of Nott.

1596
01:20:05.597 --> 01:20:07.270
Are you okay?

1597
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:08.453
SAM Nope!

1598
01:20:08.453 --> 01:20:13.453
LIAM: Well, if it's any help,

1599
01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:17.603
you're not alone.

1600
01:20:17.603 --> 01:20:21.431
No matter what happens, we'll be here for you.

1601
01:20:21.431 --> 01:20:23.174
SAM: Thank you.

1602
01:20:23.174 --> 01:20:24.952
Don't, don't leave.

1603
01:20:24.952 --> 01:20:29.558
In fact, maybe one of you or something could go in first

1604
01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:30.816
and sort of--

1605
01:20:30.816 --> 01:20:32.724
LAURA: Present you or something?

1606
01:20:32.724 --> 01:20:35.200
LIAM: Jester, you've been speaking to him.

1607
01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.132
LAURA: That's true, I have been.

1608
01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:39.053
I could present you.

1609
01:20:39.053 --> 01:20:41.224
SAM: Sure. That's a good idea.

1610
01:20:41.224 --> 01:20:43.011
LAURA: Yes.

1611
01:20:43.011 --> 01:20:46.167
SAM: Don't build me up too much because,

1612
01:20:46.167 --> 01:20:50.337
I don't know, if I get a detail wrong or something or--

1613
01:20:50.337 --> 01:20:53.057
LAURA: I'll let him know, you know.

1614
01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:57.687
You're a little different, but you're the same.

1615
01:20:57.687 --> 01:21:00.239
SAM: All right.

1616
01:21:00.239 --> 01:21:04.001
Do you have any of those oils?

1617
01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:06.395
LAURA: Like, you want to wear my mom's perfume?

1618
01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:07.228
SAM: Yes.

1619
01:21:07.228 --> 01:21:10.453
LAURA: Okay! Here, I put a little lavender oil

1620
01:21:10.453 --> 01:21:11.895
around her neck.

1621
01:21:11.895 --> 01:21:13.309
Here, put it on your wrists, too.

1622
01:21:13.309 --> 01:21:14.972
My mom always did right here.

1623
01:21:14.972 --> 01:21:19.296
SAM: Can I just, just a little bit, just in case.

1624
01:21:19.296 --> 01:21:23.211
LAURA: Well, that's really-- if you want.

1625
01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:26.031
Here, put it on your finger or something because that's not.

1626
01:21:26.031 --> 01:21:28.057
LIAM and TALIESIN: Oh.

1627
01:21:28.057 --> 01:21:31.520
LAURA: I just didn't want to use the actual thing for it.

1628
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.428
LIAM: It's not a conjugal visit.

1629
01:21:33.428 --> 01:21:34.906
Is that one of the criteria?

1630
01:21:34.906 --> 01:21:37.747
SAM: I don't know! I'm prepared for anything!

1631
01:21:37.747 --> 01:21:41.078
You don't go to a date with two dollars in your pocket

1632
01:21:41.078 --> 01:21:43.803
and shitty underwear, do you? No!

1633
01:21:43.803 --> 01:21:44.636
TRAVIS: Good question.

1634
01:21:44.636 --> 01:21:48.723
Is the prisoner alone in this cell?

1635
01:21:48.723 --> 01:21:50.387
MATT: You look into the cell?

1636
01:21:50.387 --> 01:21:52.697
SAM: You wear the best fucking underwear you own!

1637
01:21:52.697 --> 01:21:54.322
LIAM: I did once, but never after that.

1638
01:21:54.322 --> 01:21:55.614
SAM: Just in case!

1639
01:21:55.614 --> 01:21:58.649
TALIESIN: Keep wearing it every day. Lucky underwear.

1640
01:21:58.649 --> 01:22:00.632
TRAVIS: I love that you even know

1641
01:22:00.632 --> 01:22:02.464
that there are best underwear.

1642
01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:04.249
LIAM: It's on par with leather armor.

1643
01:22:04.249 --> 01:22:08.043
MATT: The cell is about 20 feet deep, ten feet wide.

1644
01:22:08.043 --> 01:22:11.278
Aside from the bars towards the very front,

1645
01:22:11.278 --> 01:22:14.613
the chamber is solid iron.

1646
01:22:14.613 --> 01:22:18.479
The floor is stone,

1647
01:22:18.479 --> 01:22:21.653
very hardy stone,

1648
01:22:21.653 --> 01:22:23.899
and elements of the floor have

1649
01:22:23.899 --> 01:22:27.650
scattered bits of soft-dried grasses.

1650
01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:29.106
There appears to be a bedroll

1651
01:22:29.106 --> 01:22:31.689
that is tossed in the corner and a pot.

1652
01:22:31.689 --> 01:22:34.345
You see, off in the corner,

1653
01:22:34.345 --> 01:22:38.717
knees to the chest, looking forward, spooked,

1654
01:22:38.717 --> 01:22:41.783
a halfling man,

1655
01:22:41.783 --> 01:22:45.454
curly, matted brown hair,

1656
01:22:45.454 --> 01:22:50.330
gaunt, pale,

1657
01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:53.156
bags under his eyes.

1658
01:22:53.156 --> 01:22:57.334
Wearing a basic cloth tunic

1659
01:22:57.334 --> 01:23:00.080
that looks somewhat torn in one sleeve.

1660
01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.628
Remnants of a vest.

1661
01:23:03.628 --> 01:23:07.854
Actually looks partially eaten.

1662
01:23:07.854 --> 01:23:12.651
Slacks that appear to be scraped and torn in places,

1663
01:23:12.651 --> 01:23:17.312
but he's just knees clutched to the chest.

1664
01:23:17.312 --> 01:23:19.869
TRAVIS: He's in there by himself.

1665
01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:21.116
Are you?

1666
01:23:21.116 --> 01:23:26.116
SAM: I'll cast Disguise Self on myself,

1667
01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.551
and I will look like Veth Brenatto: dark skin,

1668
01:23:32.999 --> 01:23:36.782
bushy eyebrows, gold band across her hair,

1669
01:23:36.782 --> 01:23:41.741
long dark hair, necklace made of buttons,

1670
01:23:41.741 --> 01:23:46.741
gray dress, little booties.

1671
01:23:47.139 --> 01:23:52.114
Yeah, some baubles and trinkets all over.

1672
01:23:53.569 --> 01:23:55.072
That's it, but you go in first.

1673
01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:56.217
LAURA: Yeah, you look really good.

1674
01:23:56.217 --> 01:23:57.592
SAM: Okay, set me up.

1675
01:23:57.592 --> 01:24:00.502
LAURA: Okay, okay. I walk in.

1676
01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:03.052
MATT: "Who's, who's there?"

1677
01:24:03.052 --> 01:24:07.395
LAURA: Guess who it is?!
SAM: Jesus.

1678
01:24:07.395 --> 01:24:11.490
TRAVIS: Are you fucking serious?!

1679
01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:15.102
He's been eating his shirt!

1680
01:24:16.991 --> 01:24:21.004
LIAM: This is fucking Alcatraz!

1681
01:24:21.004 --> 01:24:25.088
TRAVIS: Will I live, will I die, I don't know.

1682
01:24:25.088 --> 01:24:27.203
LIAM: Jean Valjean: 20 years, breaking rocks.

1683
01:24:27.203 --> 01:24:30.628
TALIESIN: We've got balloon animals!

1684
01:24:30.628 --> 01:24:32.992
LAURA: I don't have a world limit now, buddy.

1685
01:24:32.992 --> 01:24:36.809
(laughter)

1686
01:24:37.796 --> 01:24:41.035
TALIESIN: She makes me so sad.

1687
01:24:41.035 --> 01:24:42.405
MATT: As soon as you say that,

1688
01:24:42.405 --> 01:24:44.357
he skitters back a bit.

1689
01:24:44.357 --> 01:24:47.135
"Oh, I recognize that voice."

1690
01:24:47.135 --> 01:24:48.302
LAURA: Yeah, right?

1691
01:24:49.992 --> 01:24:51.283
Just like I said, Yeza!

1692
01:24:51.283 --> 01:24:52.517
MATT: "You weren't lying, you--"

1693
01:24:52.517 --> 01:24:53.350
LAURA: No!

1694
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:55.930
You're not crazy, I swear.

1695
01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:57.344
MATT: He scrambles up a little bit,

1696
01:24:57.344 --> 01:24:59.066
like getting to his feet and

1697
01:24:59.066 --> 01:25:01.210
catches himself on the wall, a little woozy.

1698
01:25:01.210 --> 01:25:02.901
LAURA: Take it easy, you've been down here

1699
01:25:02.901 --> 01:25:07.804
I don't know how long.

1700
01:25:07.804 --> 01:25:09.086
MATT: "Where is she?"

1701
01:25:09.086 --> 01:25:12.496
LAURA: She is waiting outside the cell.

1702
01:25:12.496 --> 01:25:15.688
I'm just coming in because I want to let you know, you know,

1703
01:25:15.688 --> 01:25:18.397
that, as you know, things are a little different

1704
01:25:18.397 --> 01:25:21.553
than they were before, right?

1705
01:25:21.553 --> 01:25:24.149
But she still loves you so, so, so much

1706
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:26.543
that we all had to come here for you.

1707
01:25:26.543 --> 01:25:29.103
We came really far to rescue you

1708
01:25:29.103 --> 01:25:32.635
because she loves you so much.

1709
01:25:32.635 --> 01:25:34.618
Okay?

1710
01:25:34.618 --> 01:25:35.904
MATT: "Okay."

1711
01:25:35.904 --> 01:25:40.904
LAURA: Just keep an open mind and remember that

1712
01:25:41.564 --> 01:25:43.338
you know, sometimes we look different,

1713
01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:48.338
but in our hearts, we're still very much the same.

1714
01:25:48.449 --> 01:25:51.143
MATT: "Do you have any food and water?"

1715
01:25:51.143 --> 01:25:54.302
(laughter)

1716
01:25:54.302 --> 01:25:55.868
LAURA: Yes.

1717
01:25:55.868 --> 01:25:58.637
I look through my bag.

1718
01:25:58.637 --> 01:26:02.189
MATT: "Really, anything."

1719
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:05.378
LAURA: Yeah, like, it's a really crusty-- okay.

1720
01:26:05.378 --> 01:26:07.734
MATT: He's just scarfing.

1721
01:26:07.734 --> 01:26:09.284
LIAM: He's eating cordyceps.

1722
01:26:09.284 --> 01:26:12.469
LAURA: Yeah, and here's a little taste of honey.

1723
01:26:12.469 --> 01:26:14.694
MATT: "Oh, wow, it's been a while."

1724
01:26:14.694 --> 01:26:19.025
LAURA: Don't make yourself sick, now.

1725
01:26:19.025 --> 01:26:20.199
MATT: "Water."

1726
01:26:20.199 --> 01:26:21.625
LAURA: Yes.

1727
01:26:21.625 --> 01:26:23.746
I have a canteen, I think.

1728
01:26:23.746 --> 01:26:28.534
LIAM: By the way, all The Mighty Nein is in the hall going--

1729
01:26:28.534 --> 01:26:29.776
MATT: (gulping)

1730
01:26:29.776 --> 01:26:33.432
He finishes off the wineskin and hands it back.

1731
01:26:33.432 --> 01:26:34.793
"Oh, thank you, thank you."

1732
01:26:34.793 --> 01:26:36.480
LAURA: You're welcome.

1733
01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.234
MATT: (burping)

1734
01:26:39.234 --> 01:26:41.738
SAM: That's his burp.

1735
01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:44.571
LAURA: It's how I imagined it would be.

1736
01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:46.357
MARISHA: While all this is happening,

1737
01:26:46.357 --> 01:26:48.527
I'm keeping an eye on Essek.

1738
01:26:48.527 --> 01:26:51.780
Just kind of lightly.

1739
01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:54.321
LAURA: Okay, well, close your eyes!

1740
01:26:54.321 --> 01:26:55.915
MATT: "Okay?"

1741
01:26:55.915 --> 01:26:57.213
LAURA: Okay.

1742
01:26:57.213 --> 01:26:58.736
SAM: Ready.
LAURA: Veth?

1743
01:26:58.736 --> 01:27:00.282
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: Come on in here, then.

1744
01:27:00.282 --> 01:27:02.399
SAM: I walk into the room.

1745
01:27:02.399 --> 01:27:05.824
LAURA: Slowly back away.
SAM: Oh god.

1746
01:27:05.824 --> 01:27:09.641
Hi, sweetie.

1747
01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:14.641
It's me, huns buns.

1748
01:27:14.784 --> 01:27:18.901
MATT: His eyes open and blink and blink,

1749
01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:23.855
and then rubs them.

1750
01:27:24.792 --> 01:27:26.700
"I thought the packages were a joke

1751
01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:29.583
"somebody was playing on me."

1752
01:27:29.583 --> 01:27:31.085
SAM: No.

1753
01:27:31.085 --> 01:27:33.515
MATT: "Was that really you?"

1754
01:27:33.515 --> 01:27:34.996
SAM: It was me.

1755
01:27:34.996 --> 01:27:39.996
I was trying to make sure you were taken care of.

1756
01:27:40.876 --> 01:27:44.709
I know you're a terrible, terrible cook and...

1757
01:27:47.049 --> 01:27:51.907
MATT: "Unless it's compounds, yeah.

1758
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:56.684
"Where, where have you been?"

1759
01:27:56.684 --> 01:28:01.601
SAM: A lot has happened.

1760
01:28:01.601 --> 01:28:05.604
When we separated that night, I,

1761
01:28:05.604 --> 01:28:10.529
I was taken and terrible things were done to me,

1762
01:28:13.104 --> 01:28:16.600
and I was changed a bit.

1763
01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.242
MATT: "That's okay."

1764
01:28:18.242 --> 01:28:20.675
SAM: No, don't, don't touch me.

1765
01:28:20.675 --> 01:28:24.441
Not yet, anyway. I'm sorry.

1766
01:28:24.441 --> 01:28:29.436
It's just, what you're seeing is not how I really look.

1767
01:28:29.436 --> 01:28:32.470
It's an illusion.

1768
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:37.096
I look much different and I'm afraid

1769
01:28:37.096 --> 01:28:40.564
you won't like it.

1770
01:28:40.564 --> 01:28:42.850
And that's okay.

1771
01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:44.724
Because it's not me,

1772
01:28:44.724 --> 01:28:49.299
it's what they turned me into.

1773
01:28:49.299 --> 01:28:51.781
MATT: "You think that matters?"

1774
01:28:51.781 --> 01:28:54.601
SAM: Yes, I do.

1775
01:28:54.601 --> 01:28:58.526
It matters to me.

1776
01:28:58.526 --> 01:29:01.693
MATT: "It's still you, right?"

1777
01:29:01.693 --> 01:29:02.687
SAM: It is.

1778
01:29:02.687 --> 01:29:04.794
MATT: "And you're alive?"

1779
01:29:04.794 --> 01:29:08.394
SAM: I am.

1780
01:29:08.394 --> 01:29:13.339
MATT: "That's the best news I've heard in a long time."

1781
01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:18.942
SAM: If I show you, will you

1782
01:29:18.942 --> 01:29:22.050
promise not to

1783
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:26.062
laugh or cry or,

1784
01:29:26.062 --> 01:29:30.112
you know, throw a rock or something?

1785
01:29:30.112 --> 01:29:31.190
MATT: "I promise."

1786
01:29:33.574 --> 01:29:35.748
SAM: She's really strong, so if you did,

1787
01:29:35.748 --> 01:29:37.428
she might just, like--
LAURA: I would cut you.

1788
01:29:37.428 --> 01:29:39.016
SAM: Yeah.

1789
01:29:39.016 --> 01:29:42.824
I was going to say, like, restrain, he's my husband.

1790
01:29:42.824 --> 01:29:45.849
LAURA: Don't you hurt my friend.

1791
01:29:45.849 --> 01:29:49.177
MATT: "Who?"
LAURA: She loves you so much.

1792
01:29:49.177 --> 01:29:52.317
MATT: "Okay.

1793
01:29:52.317 --> 01:29:54.195
"Who is--?"
SAM: She's my friend.

1794
01:29:54.195 --> 01:29:55.377
I have a bunch of friends.

1795
01:29:55.377 --> 01:29:56.784
They're all outside, they're probably

1796
01:29:56.784 --> 01:29:59.529
poking their heads in right now.

1797
01:29:59.529 --> 01:30:02.135
TRAVIS: See one hand sticks out.

1798
01:30:02.135 --> 01:30:04.685
MATT: "Hey, hi, friends."

1799
01:30:04.685 --> 01:30:07.043
SAM: They helped me get here

1800
01:30:07.043 --> 01:30:12.043
and they helped me find you and they're going to help me

1801
01:30:12.625 --> 01:30:15.650
become me again, someday.

1802
01:30:15.650 --> 01:30:18.842
For now, they've helped me get to you,

1803
01:30:18.842 --> 01:30:23.309
which is the best gift ever and

1804
01:30:23.309 --> 01:30:27.635
I'm so happy you're alive.

1805
01:30:27.635 --> 01:30:29.762
I saw Luke, he's okay.

1806
01:30:29.762 --> 01:30:30.687
MATT: "Is he okay?"

1807
01:30:30.687 --> 01:30:32.587
SAM: He's okay, he's fine.

1808
01:30:32.587 --> 01:30:35.199
He's safe in Alfield right now.

1809
01:30:35.199 --> 01:30:36.749
But actually--

1810
01:30:36.749 --> 01:30:38.181
MATT: "When they attacked,

1811
01:30:38.181 --> 01:30:42.770
"luckily, he was at Edith's and I was afraid

1812
01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:47.099
"until you began to talk to me,

1813
01:30:47.099 --> 01:30:48.970
"but I didn't know what to trust anymore.

1814
01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:51.391
"I've been in a daze, I'm sorry."

1815
01:30:51.391 --> 01:30:54.233
SAM: We have a lot to talk about.

1816
01:30:54.233 --> 01:30:58.026
I don't know if they'll let me take you away from here today

1817
01:30:58.026 --> 01:31:01.722
but for now, just know that my only existence

1818
01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:06.202
has been getting back to you and the boy, this whole time,

1819
01:31:06.202 --> 01:31:11.177
and I'm sorry it's taken me this long.

1820
01:31:13.988 --> 01:31:16.955
MATT: "It's okay."

1821
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:20.708
LAURA: I'm going to back out of the room

1822
01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:23.538
to give you guys some privacy.

1823
01:31:23.538 --> 01:31:27.596
SAM: They turned me into a monster, honey.

1824
01:31:27.596 --> 01:31:31.598
And just,

1825
01:31:31.598 --> 01:31:36.073
I won't always be like this, but...

1826
01:31:38.725 --> 01:31:40.182
You know, Beau made a good suggestion.

1827
01:31:40.182 --> 01:31:45.023
Maybe come over and just take my hand first.

1828
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:50.010
MATT: As he reaches out, there's a trepidation,

1829
01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:55.010
like he's afraid you'll disappear.

1830
01:31:55.681 --> 01:32:00.681
He touches your fingertips and takes your hand

1831
01:32:01.409 --> 01:32:06.400
and runs his fingers over yours.

1832
01:32:07.928 --> 01:32:11.781
SAM: It's a little weird, right?

1833
01:32:11.781 --> 01:32:16.336
MATT: "Maybe, but you're warm."

1834
01:32:16.336 --> 01:32:20.211
SAM: Touch my face.

1835
01:32:30.918 --> 01:32:34.785
MATT: "There's a lot going on here."

1836
01:32:35.630 --> 01:32:36.925
SAM: Yeah.

1837
01:32:36.925 --> 01:32:38.934
Yeah, maybe the touch thing doesn't--

1838
01:32:38.934 --> 01:32:41.341
maybe that makes it even creepier somehow. No, yeah.

1839
01:32:41.341 --> 01:32:43.374
MATT: He finds the ears.

1840
01:32:43.374 --> 01:32:45.656
SAM: Those are long, they're long.

1841
01:32:45.656 --> 01:32:50.631
They just keep going, just keep going.

1842
01:32:51.548 --> 01:32:56.066
MATT: Just touches the nose and the lips and the chin.

1843
01:32:56.066 --> 01:33:00.632
SAM: It's a mess, a real, it's a nightmare place.

1844
01:33:00.632 --> 01:33:04.023
This whole area is just rough.

1845
01:33:04.023 --> 01:33:06.459
MATT: "But it's you, right, it's Veth?"

1846
01:33:06.459 --> 01:33:09.537
SAM: It's me.

1847
01:33:09.537 --> 01:33:12.561
I mean, I think it is.

1848
01:33:12.561 --> 01:33:16.868
It's me inside,

1849
01:33:16.868 --> 01:33:20.438
but it's the wrong body.

1850
01:33:20.438 --> 01:33:25.322
It's the wrong body, but it's the right me, so,

1851
01:33:26.793 --> 01:33:31.726
here, I'll just show you. And I'll drop the spell.

1852
01:33:34.263 --> 01:33:36.146
MATT: There's a brief moment

1853
01:33:36.146 --> 01:33:40.054
where you hear the breath (inhale).

1854
01:33:43.187 --> 01:33:48.187
You watch him process.

1855
01:33:53.488 --> 01:33:55.741
SAM: I turn around slowly.

1856
01:33:55.741 --> 01:33:58.758
MATT: As you turn around, you feel his hand

1857
01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:03.758
touch your shoulder and stop you.

1858
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.925
"It's still you though, right?"

1859
01:34:10.775 --> 01:34:13.691
SAM: Yeah.

1860
01:34:13.691 --> 01:34:18.691
MATT: "And that's all that matters.

1861
01:34:18.915 --> 01:34:22.645
"It'll take a little getting used to.

1862
01:34:22.645 --> 01:34:26.240
"I don't even-- that's a lot of teeth."

1863
01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.745
SAM: It's a lot of teeth, yep.

1864
01:34:27.745 --> 01:34:30.454
I mean, we don't have to kiss or anything.

1865
01:34:30.454 --> 01:34:35.179
I don't even know how that would work.

1866
01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:41.223
I mean, I spent some time with the goblins,

1867
01:34:41.223 --> 01:34:45.442
they held me prisoner, and

1868
01:34:45.442 --> 01:34:48.400
they don't really kiss and I can see why.

1869
01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:53.400
It would just be like a lot of clacking.

1870
01:34:53.735 --> 01:34:55.211
MATT: "Yeah.

1871
01:34:55.211 --> 01:34:58.919
"Like throwing all the dishes into a pile, yeah."

1872
01:34:58.919 --> 01:35:01.369
SAM: Yeah.

1873
01:35:03.368 --> 01:35:06.110
I mean, you can-- I know I'm hideous,

1874
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:07.703
you don't have to hold back, it's--

1875
01:35:07.703 --> 01:35:12.703
MATT: He takes you and wraps his arms around you.

1876
01:35:13.119 --> 01:35:15.366
SAM: I'll hug him back.

1877
01:35:15.366 --> 01:35:17.936
Squeeze his little butt.

1878
01:35:17.936 --> 01:35:21.344
LAURA: I hope you like lavender!

1879
01:35:26.539 --> 01:35:28.289
MATT: No words.

1880
01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:33.268
He just holds you for a minute, two.

1881
01:35:39.826 --> 01:35:44.776
SAM:(sighs) I'm so happy to see you.

1882
01:35:47.927 --> 01:35:52.927
I'm so happy that you've seen me.

1883
01:35:53.091 --> 01:35:56.003
It's like a fresh start.

1884
01:35:56.003 --> 01:36:00.903
Well, no, it's like a new chance.

1885
01:36:02.736 --> 01:36:07.719
There's still a long way for me to go, and I'm afraid.

1886
01:36:09.836 --> 01:36:12.523
MATT: Pulls away a little bit and looks you in the eyes,

1887
01:36:12.523 --> 01:36:15.356
bending down a little bit.

1888
01:36:15.356 --> 01:36:19.384
"What are you afraid of now?

1889
01:36:19.384 --> 01:36:24.342
"I mean, you survived what the goblins did to you.

1890
01:36:27.024 --> 01:36:29.717
"You came this way. I mean,

1891
01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:32.422
"I know how far you came, they dragged me through it.

1892
01:36:32.422 --> 01:36:37.241
"This is a very, it's a very bad place.

1893
01:36:37.241 --> 01:36:41.473
"And you came here for me.

1894
01:36:41.473 --> 01:36:46.373
"I mean, that's braver than I could ever be.

1895
01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:52.468
"I don't know what you could possibly be scared of now."

1896
01:36:53.737 --> 01:36:58.562
SAM: I'm scared of having to do it all again.

1897
01:37:01.018 --> 01:37:04.050
Now that I'm with you, I don't know

1898
01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:08.325
how I could be apart from you, but

1899
01:37:08.325 --> 01:37:12.100
I think for us to be together,

1900
01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:15.702
we'll have to be apart again.

1901
01:37:15.702 --> 01:37:18.628
We've just--

1902
01:37:18.628 --> 01:37:21.815
we've learned things that have complicated

1903
01:37:21.815 --> 01:37:26.549
our lives even more than before.

1904
01:37:28.194 --> 01:37:33.186
MATT: "Things have been really intense for a few months."

1905
01:37:34.575 --> 01:37:36.735
SAM: Our son is out there,

1906
01:37:36.735 --> 01:37:40.984
and I'm afraid now that he's actually in a place

1907
01:37:40.984 --> 01:37:45.976
that's maybe even more dangerous than this cell.

1908
01:37:47.687 --> 01:37:51.430
One of us needs to get to him,

1909
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:53.351
and I don't know if it can be you.

1910
01:37:53.351 --> 01:37:57.032
I don't know what they have planned for you.

1911
01:37:57.032 --> 01:38:02.032
MATT: "You mean the, the lady?"

1912
01:38:02.276 --> 01:38:04.200
SAM: Yeah, what lady?

1913
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.856
MATT: "DeRogna, the one that hired me."

1914
01:38:06.856 --> 01:38:08.815
SAM: Who's that, who's that, who's that?

1915
01:38:08.815 --> 01:38:09.898
Caleb!
LIAM: Yes.

1916
01:38:09.898 --> 01:38:10.934
SAM: Who's DeRogna?

1917
01:38:10.934 --> 01:38:14.569
LIAM: She's part of the Cerberus Assembly.

1918
01:38:14.569 --> 01:38:16.514
SAM: Oh, this is Caleb, by the way.

1919
01:38:16.514 --> 01:38:18.547
He's the reason I'm alive.

1920
01:38:18.547 --> 01:38:20.283
MATT: "Hi, thank you."
LIAM: Hi.

1921
01:38:20.283 --> 01:38:23.614
SAM: He's the second smartest man in the world,

1922
01:38:23.614 --> 01:38:26.466
really, really great guy.

1923
01:38:26.466 --> 01:38:29.680
He's helped me, saved my life so many times.

1924
01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:32.225
LIAM: I've heard so much about you.

1925
01:38:32.225 --> 01:38:34.784
I hear you really know your way around a laboratory.

1926
01:38:34.784 --> 01:38:37.663
MATT: "Occasionally.

1927
01:38:37.663 --> 01:38:42.015
"It gets me into trouble, it seems.

1928
01:38:42.015 --> 01:38:44.065
"But..."

1929
01:38:45.851 --> 01:38:47.649
SAM: We're just friends, he and I are just friends, though.

1930
01:38:47.649 --> 01:38:51.099
LAURA: They're not romantic in any way. Don't worry.

1931
01:38:51.099 --> 01:38:54.043
She thinks he's like her son.

1932
01:38:54.043 --> 01:38:56.417
MATT: "Okay.

1933
01:38:56.417 --> 01:38:57.617
"You're her--"

1934
01:38:57.617 --> 01:38:58.455
SAM: No, no.

1935
01:38:58.455 --> 01:39:00.448
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

1936
01:39:00.448 --> 01:39:01.836
He's a friend of mine.

1937
01:39:01.836 --> 01:39:05.453
MATT: "Okay."

1938
01:39:05.453 --> 01:39:08.726
LIAM: One of many, come in, come in, come in.

1939
01:39:08.726 --> 01:39:10.956
TRAVIS: Hi.
MARISHA: 'Sup.

1940
01:39:10.956 --> 01:39:14.301
MATT: "Well, this is a motley crew you got here.

1941
01:39:14.301 --> 01:39:15.297
"Oh, she's big,"

1942
01:39:15.297 --> 01:39:17.406
and looks at Yasha as she looms from behind.

1943
01:39:17.406 --> 01:39:19.440
"Hello."

1944
01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:22.076
LIAM: He hasn't met Caduceus.

1945
01:39:22.076 --> 01:39:24.476
TALIESIN: Hey.

1946
01:39:27.179 --> 01:39:29.909
MATT: "What's that growing on your shield?"

1947
01:39:29.909 --> 01:39:32.084
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, that's--

1948
01:39:32.084 --> 01:39:34.629
this is kind of interesting actually, here.

1949
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:37.662
MATT: "That's like semi-phosphoric organic matter. I can--

1950
01:39:37.662 --> 01:39:39.653
"I'd be curious to know some of the properties of this

1951
01:39:39.653 --> 01:39:40.544
when we have a chance to--

1952
01:39:40.544 --> 01:39:41.377
TALIESIN: Sure.

1953
01:39:41.377 --> 01:39:42.977
That's a lot of work.

1954
01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:44.689
You can keep that, that's okay.

1955
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:49.497
Well, no, that's fair, you can do that.

1956
01:39:50.757 --> 01:39:53.535
MATT: "I can't stay here.

1957
01:39:53.535 --> 01:39:56.557
"If we go back, I have to be careful of the--

1958
01:39:56.557 --> 01:40:01.557
"that lady, she's in with some really powerful people and

1959
01:40:01.999 --> 01:40:04.731
"we began to run these experiments."

1960
01:40:04.731 --> 01:40:06.228
SAM: She hired you?

1961
01:40:06.228 --> 01:40:10.082
MATT: "Yeah, they reached out, a recommendation.

1962
01:40:10.082 --> 01:40:11.182
"Who would've thought?"

1963
01:40:11.182 --> 01:40:12.016
SAM: Oh, well, you know,

1964
01:40:12.016 --> 01:40:15.111
I was always saying that you should promote yourself more,

1965
01:40:15.111 --> 01:40:16.621
you know, get out there.
MATT: "I know, I just,

1966
01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:17.882
"I'm really bad at that."
SAM: I know, but,

1967
01:40:17.882 --> 01:40:20.739
you should always-- you lead with confidence

1968
01:40:20.739 --> 01:40:22.449
because people really respond to that.

1969
01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:24.897
MATT: "Well, you know, I'm really good at that."

1970
01:40:24.897 --> 01:40:26.645
LIAM: Maybe you could tell us all about that later

1971
01:40:26.645 --> 01:40:30.962
over dinner or something.

1972
01:40:30.962 --> 01:40:32.409
MATT: "Okay."

1973
01:40:32.409 --> 01:40:33.909
LIAM: After we leave, we'll get you fed.

1974
01:40:33.909 --> 01:40:36.531
MATT: As Essek steps into the bars and goes,

1975
01:40:36.531 --> 01:40:41.522
"Or we can discuss it now as the means of your release."

1976
01:40:42.742 --> 01:40:44.015
LAURA: Oh.

1977
01:40:44.015 --> 01:40:46.048
SAM: Sure.

1978
01:40:48.096 --> 01:40:51.637
LIAM: What do we need to cover here, sir?

1979
01:40:51.637 --> 01:40:54.461
MATT: The Shadowhand looks towards him and says,

1980
01:40:54.461 --> 01:40:58.776
"This DeRogna, what did they hire you for?

1981
01:40:58.776 --> 01:41:01.312
"What did you do,

1982
01:41:01.312 --> 01:41:06.312
"and what do you know of what you've created?"

1983
01:41:06.596 --> 01:41:11.138
"I mean, I don't have a special talent or anything.

1984
01:41:13.392 --> 01:41:17.019
"She hired me, she bought this strange box thing and

1985
01:41:17.019 --> 01:41:22.019
"she began to do experiments.

1986
01:41:22.377 --> 01:41:25.919
"She brought some people in to do different types of magic,

1987
01:41:25.919 --> 01:41:28.415
"arcane, divine, I don't know the variations there.

1988
01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:30.377
"They would be able to pull this

1989
01:41:30.377 --> 01:41:33.242
"weird, ethereal film out of it,

1990
01:41:33.242 --> 01:41:36.436
"this like gray mist. Then it was my job

1991
01:41:36.436 --> 01:41:38.871
"to try and find a compound that it would adhere to

1992
01:41:38.871 --> 01:41:43.794
"so it could be brought into an actual

1993
01:41:43.794 --> 01:41:45.524
"usable, physical form.

1994
01:41:45.524 --> 01:41:48.295
"They paid well. They said it was

1995
01:41:48.295 --> 01:41:49.527
"for the good of the Empire

1996
01:41:49.527 --> 01:41:51.887
and Empire's always been kind to us.

1997
01:41:51.887 --> 01:41:53.470
"And I--"

1998
01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:56.995
TRAVIS: (coughing) Excuse me.

1999
01:41:56.995 --> 01:41:59.108
SAM: In its very limited way.

2000
01:41:59.108 --> 01:42:01.549
Just like making sure the roads were okay.

2001
01:42:01.549 --> 01:42:02.741
TRAVIS: Just one second (coughs).

2002
01:42:02.741 --> 01:42:04.157
I'll step outside of the cell.

2003
01:42:04.157 --> 01:42:06.974
MATT: "For months, we worked in the basement.

2004
01:42:06.974 --> 01:42:08.992
"She'd, you know--

2005
01:42:08.992 --> 01:42:12.725
"I began working on trying to get this to work

2006
01:42:12.725 --> 01:42:14.487
"and it was really frustrating

2007
01:42:14.487 --> 01:42:15.986
"and they were frustrated with me

2008
01:42:15.986 --> 01:42:18.910
"and they were threatening to cancel the contract.

2009
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:21.132
"But then I found it, I found a compound

2010
01:42:21.132 --> 01:42:25.109
"that would actually bond this material to it

2011
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:30.109
"and distill it and we made one successful vial of it.

2012
01:42:30.224 --> 01:42:31.997
"It was a breakthrough.

2013
01:42:31.997 --> 01:42:34.495
"I was proud. She's usually very intense,

2014
01:42:34.495 --> 01:42:36.525
"but she was very nice that day.

2015
01:42:36.525 --> 01:42:39.297
"She was very positive.

2016
01:42:39.297 --> 01:42:43.988
"She said this was good work, she appreciated it.

2017
01:42:43.988 --> 01:42:48.155
"She said that they'd hold off

2018
01:42:48.155 --> 01:42:49.367
"on the experiments for a while.

2019
01:42:49.367 --> 01:42:51.684
"She took the box back with her,

2020

"saying that they were going to hire me

"to make a lot more of these soon,

2022
01:42:55.457 --> 01:42:58.439
"and they were going to ramp up production.

2023
01:42:58.439 --> 01:43:00.295
"They'd hopefully be able to provide enough gold

2024
01:43:00.295 --> 01:43:04.180
"to where we could buy a new home for me and Luke

01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:08.102
"and now you!

01:43:08.102 --> 01:43:09.167
"We were thinking maybe like

"Deastok or Trostenwald or something.

01:43:10.926 --> 01:43:13.235
"Not but two days later,

2029
01:43:13.235 --> 01:43:18.065
"the house was attacked," and looks up at Essek.

2030
01:43:18.065 --> 01:43:22.208
"Thankfully, Luke was off at Edith's house

2031
01:43:22.208 --> 01:43:23.669
"and they destroyed everything.

2032
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:27.235
"They asked me questions, but

2033
01:43:27.235 --> 01:43:31.578
"Lady DeRogna said not to tell anybody anything,

2034
01:43:31.578 --> 01:43:35.398
"that if anybody was told about what we were doing

2035
01:43:35.398 --> 01:43:40.014
"that she would take Luke away and

2036
01:43:40.014 --> 01:43:44.374
"I can't let that happen.

2037
01:43:44.374 --> 01:43:46.054
"So she can't know about this."

2038
01:43:46.054 --> 01:43:48.573
Looks over towards the Shadowhand.

2039
01:43:48.573 --> 01:43:53.573
"She cannot know about this, please.

2040
01:43:53.585 --> 01:43:55.364
"They dragged me through all these terrible places,

2041
01:43:55.364 --> 01:44:00.364
"chained to like a giant nightmare, this worm thing,

2042
01:44:00.553 --> 01:44:03.051
"and they brought me here and they just watched me

01:44:03.051 --> 01:44:04.647
"from the shadows, asking me questions

01:44:04.647 --> 01:44:06.947
"about experiments and starving me.

01:44:06.947 --> 01:44:09.702
"But I didn't say anything, I didn't say anything

2046
01:44:09.702 --> 01:44:11.338
"because I knew you were coming

2047
01:44:11.338 --> 01:44:16.338
"and I didn't want anything to happen to Luke and

01:44:16.953 --> 01:44:20.932
"I didn't tell them anything.

2049
01:44:20.932 --> 01:44:22.960
"That's it."

2050
01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.547
The Shadowhand stands by and goes, "Very well.

2051
01:44:27.547 --> 01:44:30.494
"It seems that not all forms of interrogation are effective,

2052
01:44:30.494 --> 01:44:35.075
"but alternate means can be.

2053
01:44:35.075 --> 01:44:37.130
"The prisoner is free to go.

01:44:37.130 --> 01:44:40.053
"He is your charge now."

2055
01:44:40.053 --> 01:44:41.036
SAM: Really?

2056
01:44:41.036 --> 01:44:44.208
MATT: "Of course, we have what we need, thank you."

2057
01:44:44.208 --> 01:44:45.654
LAURA: Thank you.

2058
01:44:45.654 --> 01:44:48.749
SAM: Yes, thank you.

2059
01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:51.097
TRAVIS: Are we free to go? Do I believe him?

2060
01:44:51.097 --> 01:44:52.707
MATT: Make an insight check.

2061
01:44:52.707 --> 01:44:55.790
TALIESIN: I mean, no sense of lying at this point.

2062
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:58.265
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2063
01:44:58.265 --> 01:45:00.306
MATT: What was your question?

2064
01:45:00.306 --> 01:45:03.639
MARISHA: I was wondering if I saw any indication

2065
01:45:03.639 --> 01:45:07.556
of what forms of interrogation they were using.

2066
01:45:08.608 --> 01:45:10.407
While walking through.

2067
01:45:10.407 --> 01:45:11.241
TRAVIS: Starvation.

2068
01:45:11.241 --> 01:45:13.539
MATT: With your passive perception

2069
01:45:13.539 --> 01:45:16.104
and your lack of darkvision,

2070
01:45:16.104 --> 01:45:17.804
you haven't seen really much anything.

2071
01:45:17.804 --> 01:45:19.263
You've seen the outside of the cells

2072
01:45:19.263 --> 01:45:20.490
and occasional shapes moving

2073
01:45:20.490 --> 01:45:21.592
from what little light makes it through,

2074
01:45:21.592 --> 01:45:24.403
but you haven't gained any information

2075
01:45:24.403 --> 01:45:27.386
in a passing stance to ascertain what that is.

2076
01:45:27.386 --> 01:45:29.010
Now, for you, it's a natural 20,

2077
01:45:29.010 --> 01:45:30.381
but what's your total?

2078
01:45:30.381 --> 01:45:35.355
TRAVIS: Insight is negative two, so 18.

2079
01:45:36.908 --> 01:45:38.491
SAM: Guys, D&amp;D Beyond.

2080
01:45:39.426 --> 01:45:41.165
LAURA: ♪ D&amp;D ♪

2081
01:45:41.165 --> 01:45:43.465
MARISHA: That was so cute.

2082
01:45:43.465 --> 01:45:45.376
SAM: My shark act? Thank you.

2083
01:45:45.376 --> 01:45:47.449
I worked really hard on it.

2084
01:45:47.449 --> 01:45:50.454
MARISHA: A little rainbow room.

2085
01:45:50.454 --> 01:45:54.558
LIAM: You had managed to drive the shark out of our minds.

2086
01:45:54.558 --> 01:45:58.316
Why would you recall?

2087
01:45:59.375 --> 01:46:01.747
MATT: He looks back to the jailer.

2088
01:46:01.747 --> 01:46:05.466
"Close up the cell, we no longer have reason to use it.

2089

"Come, I will bring you back to the surface.

2090
01:46:09.474 --> 01:46:11.520
"You come along as well, my friend."

2091
01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:15.603
He looks down, smiles at Yeza and Yeza's,

2092
01:46:18.172 --> 01:46:21.121
"Okay."

2093
01:46:21.121 --> 01:46:23.972
Essek turns and begins to walk.

2094
01:46:23.972 --> 01:46:25.097
Do you follow?

2095
01:46:25.097 --> 01:46:28.305
SAM: Yeah. I'll take Yeza by the hand.

2096
01:46:28.305 --> 01:46:30.688
MATT: Okay. He takes yours and squeezes it.

2097
01:46:30.688 --> 01:46:34.057
His grip isn't very strong, he's still pretty weak.

2098
01:46:34.057 --> 01:46:36.384
SAM: Never was.

2099
01:46:36.384 --> 01:46:37.475
LIAM: Like Fjord.

2100
01:46:37.475 --> 01:46:41.917
(laughter)

2101
01:46:41.917 --> 01:46:45.667
SAM: It's like five noodles at the end of a stick.

2102
01:46:48.033 --> 01:46:51.374
MATT: It's a long hop from Grog.

2103
01:46:52.326 --> 01:46:53.734
Guided back through the process,

2104
01:46:53.734 --> 01:46:56.592
the same weird sensation overwhelms you

2105
01:46:56.592 --> 01:47:00.425
and it feels like

2106
01:47:01.659 --> 01:47:04.529
a form of intoxication where you feel sluggish,

2107
01:47:04.529 --> 01:47:06.703
but everything around you's moving very quickly.

2108
01:47:06.703 --> 01:47:09.062
It's a blur of lights and faces and guards

2109
01:47:09.062 --> 01:47:12.030
and people and stairs and doorways and suddenly

2110
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:16.161
you're outside of the iron barracks.

2111
01:47:16.161 --> 01:47:19.379
LAURA: That's why I don't drink.

2112
01:47:19.379 --> 01:47:20.952
MATT: In the Shadowshire.

2113
01:47:20.952 --> 01:47:24.122
"Well, if you're looking for a place to say,

2114
01:47:24.122 --> 01:47:26.492
"I have a recommendation.

2115
01:47:26.492 --> 01:47:29.542
"I can go ahead and lead you to the Gallimaufry.

2116
01:47:29.542 --> 01:47:32.529
"It is the more rowdy district.

2117
01:47:32.529 --> 01:47:36.062
"Seems to be a little more your style.

2118
01:47:36.062 --> 01:47:37.891
"There is The Dim's Inn.

2119
01:47:37.891 --> 01:47:39.182
"We'll get you a room there.

2120
01:47:39.182 --> 01:47:40.015
MARISHA: Dim's Inn?

2121
01:47:40.015 --> 01:47:41.690
MATT: "The Dim's Inn."

2122
01:47:41.690 --> 01:47:43.677
TRAVIS: The Galamari or the Agalamari?

2123
01:47:43.677 --> 01:47:47.446
MATT and TRAVIS: Gallimaufry.

2124
01:47:47.446 --> 01:47:50.563
LIAM: Gallimaufry is the place or the district?

2125
01:47:50.563 --> 01:47:52.026
MATT: It's the district.

2126
01:47:52.026 --> 01:47:54.004
TALIESIN: Might be looking for a blacksmith

2127
01:47:54.004 --> 01:47:56.105
at some point, too, if you have a recommendation

2128
01:47:56.105 --> 01:47:59.393
for someone who's extremely skilled,

2129
01:47:59.393 --> 01:48:03.673
someone who you would be impressed by.

2130
01:48:03.673 --> 01:48:06.619
MATT: "Don't do much in blacksmithing, not my specialty."

2131
01:48:06.619 --> 01:48:09.461
His hand rises out of the curtains

2132
01:48:09.461 --> 01:48:11.533
that is his cloak and his hand passes.

2133
01:48:11.533 --> 01:48:16.533
These trails of somewhat translucent, gray energy

2134
01:48:16.683 --> 01:48:18.309
drifts off his fingertips for a second

2135
01:48:18.309 --> 01:48:22.672
and float there before dissipating.

2136
01:48:22.672 --> 01:48:24.824
TALIESIN: Seemed a man of taste, I just thought I'd ask.

2137
01:48:24.824 --> 01:48:26.615
TRAVIS: Are there like six kobolds

2138
01:48:26.615 --> 01:48:28.368
inside of his fucking robes?

2139
01:48:28.368 --> 01:48:31.275
MATT: Make a perception check.

2140
01:48:31.275 --> 01:48:33.887
TRAVIS: Natural one!

2141
01:48:33.887 --> 01:48:35.588
MATT: Like 17 kobolds.

2142
01:48:35.588 --> 01:48:39.344
TRAVIS: (screaming)

2143
01:48:39.344 --> 01:48:43.810
MATT: It's following you, Fjord.

2144
01:48:43.810 --> 01:48:46.287
"We'll see what we can do, but for now, let's go over to--"

2145
01:48:46.287 --> 01:48:49.646
SAM: Will we be disturbed there at the inn

2146
01:48:49.646 --> 01:48:51.893
for being outsiders or anything?

2147
01:48:51.893 --> 01:48:54.064
MATT: "Not with those medallions.

2148
01:48:54.064 --> 01:48:56.274
"I recommend not losing them."

2149
01:48:56.274 --> 01:48:57.107
SAM: I won't.

2150
01:48:57.107 --> 01:48:59.143
MATT: "Good. Come."

2151
01:48:59.143 --> 01:49:00.293
LAURA: I like this guy.

2152
01:49:00.293 --> 01:49:01.289
SAM: I don't know about this guy.

2153
01:49:01.289 --> 01:49:02.802
LAURA: I think he's pretty cool.

2154
01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:03.635
TALIESIN: I kind of like him.

2155
01:49:03.635 --> 01:49:06.018
MATT: You follow him through the Shadowshire,

2156
01:49:06.018 --> 01:49:07.868
back to the stairs ascending.

2157
01:49:07.868 --> 01:49:09.874
LIAM: Small thing, as everyone's walking,

2158
01:49:09.874 --> 01:49:12.709
Caleb sidles up next to Nott,

2159
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:16.326
places a hand on her shoulder and gives it a squeeze

2160
01:49:16.326 --> 01:49:18.211
and then walks off and falls in by Beauregard

2161
01:49:18.211 --> 01:49:19.222
and keeps walking.

2162
01:49:19.222 --> 01:49:20.555
MATT: Okay.

2163
01:49:20.555 --> 01:49:24.400
Ascending the wide, spiral stairs back to the surface

2164
01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.986
of Rosohna, Ghor Dranas. We're going to take a break.

2165
01:49:27.986 --> 01:49:30.405
LAURA: Woo!

2166
01:49:30.405 --> 01:49:32.855
TRAVIS: Wow, wow, wow.
SAM: Man.

2167
01:49:32.855 --> 01:49:36.139
LIAM: (creepy voice) Well, Fjord, I hear you like kobolds.

2168
01:49:36.139 --> 01:49:41.139
SAM: I love you, Travis, but three months at sea,

2169
01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:45.600
two weeks in Ghor Dranas,

2170
01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:49.211
my storyline completed,

2171
01:49:49.211 --> 01:49:53.299
just a clean arc, just a clean arc,

2172
01:49:53.299 --> 01:49:56.831
yours is just what?

2173
01:49:56.831 --> 01:49:59.707
TRAVIS: Can't help you if you have a thin storyline.

2174
01:49:59.707 --> 01:50:02.154
(laughter)

2175
01:50:02.154 --> 01:50:03.970
TALIESIN: Wow.

2176
01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:06.061
LAURA: You guys haven't tried to bone yet. You don't know.

2177
01:50:06.061 --> 01:50:07.261
SAM: Me and Travis? We've tried a lot.

2178
01:50:07.261 --> 01:50:08.586
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2179
01:50:08.586 --> 01:50:11.019
(laughter)

2180
01:50:11.019 --> 01:50:12.620
SAM: Didn't work.

2181
01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:16.431
Square peg and round hole.

2182
01:50:16.431 --> 01:50:17.306
MATT: On that note.

2183
01:50:17.306 --> 01:50:18.622
LIAM: We kept pushing them together,

2184
01:50:18.622 --> 01:50:19.980
but nothing happened.

2185
01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:22.188
TRAVIS: You can't force it.

2186
01:50:22.188 --> 01:50:23.969
LAURA and TALIESIN: Wow.

2187
01:50:23.969 --> 01:50:26.494
MATT: We're going to go and take a break here for

2188
01:50:26.494 --> 01:50:28.225
a number of minutes.

2189
01:50:28.225 --> 01:50:32.138
In the meantime, we do have our giveaway.

2190
01:50:32.138 --> 01:50:35.802
Our friends at Wyrmwood

2191
01:50:35.802 --> 01:50:38.028
are giving away another one of their Kickstarter sets

2192
01:50:38.028 --> 01:50:41.703
of their fantastic, these are monkeywood tabletop tiles.

2193
01:50:41.703 --> 01:50:43.625
This is the actual [inaudible].

2194
01:50:43.625 --> 01:50:45.140
You can check out Wyrmwood's Kickstarter

2195
01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:47.448
for these right now to pick up your own set.

2196
01:50:47.448 --> 01:50:49.003
They're awesome, they magnetize together

2197
01:50:49.003 --> 01:50:51.074
and they create all these cool elements.

2198
01:50:51.074 --> 01:50:53.781
Like there's a dice jail, there's a spell slot coordinator,

2199
01:50:53.781 --> 01:50:55.111
which you use magnets to pull it out, which is awesome.

2200
01:50:55.111 --> 01:50:58.348
LAURA: You can say like I want to let Laura have them

2201
01:50:58.348 --> 01:50:59.942
and then--
MATT: Laura can't have them,

2202
01:50:59.942 --> 01:51:01.614
they're for you.

2203
01:51:01.614 --> 01:51:03.899
Nevertheless, we'll have a winner back for that shortly.

2204
01:51:03.899 --> 01:51:07.732
Tonight's word is alliances, plural.

2205
01:51:07.732 --> 01:51:09.549
Alliances.

2206
01:51:09.549 --> 01:51:12.011
Go ahead and put that once into our Twitch chat;

2207
01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:13.987
more than once and you'll be disqualified. Once again,

2208
01:51:13.987 --> 01:51:15.843
for people in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Quebec,

2209
01:51:15.843 --> 01:51:18.107
because of dumb laws but we'll be back here shortly,

2210
01:51:18.107 --> 01:51:20.543
we'll see you in a minute.

DANI: (sighs) I just want to watch my Critical Role.

2230
01:52:20.984 --> 01:52:22.650
TALIESIN: For your consideration,

2231
01:52:22.650 --> 01:52:24.108
this is the face of a Critter

2232
01:52:24.108 --> 01:52:26.882
who's craving their Critical Role content.

2233
01:52:26.882 --> 01:52:28.856
But for this sanctimonious shipper,

2234
01:52:28.856 --> 01:52:31.812
time misled them like a trip to the Feywild.

2235
01:52:31.812 --> 01:52:34.919
They now have come face to face with existential dread,

2236
01:52:34.919 --> 01:52:38.232
a fear of sardonic spoilers.

2237
01:52:38.232 --> 01:52:39.760
Let us lead them across the bridge

2238
01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:42.266
into a realm of bright shadows where,

2239
01:52:42.266 --> 01:52:43.848
even if one misses the live viewing

2240
01:52:43.848 --> 01:52:45.590
of their favorite program,

2241
01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:47.558
they can still watch it on demand,

2242
01:52:47.558 --> 01:52:48.652
if they bear the mark of a

2243
01:52:48.652 --> 01:52:51.093
Twitch subscription to the channel.

2244
01:52:51.093 --> 01:52:55.313
That mark, a mysterious sigil of emoticons made by the sage

2245
01:52:55.313 --> 01:52:58.864
Arsequeef, in this land of shadow

2246
01:52:58.864 --> 01:53:01.117
known as the Twitch subscription zone

2247
01:53:01.117 --> 01:53:03.029
no shipper, fanfic-er,

2248
01:53:03.029 --> 01:53:04.951
or please name my kitten litter Critter

2249
01:53:04.951 --> 01:53:07.751
has to feel like a bitter fritter.

2250
01:53:07.751 --> 01:53:10.725
And so ends another meandering digression,

2251
01:53:10.725 --> 01:53:14.153
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

2252
01:53:14.153 --> 01:53:18.314

01:53:18.314 --> 01:53:20.890

TRAVIS: Last time on Yee-haw Game Ranch.

2260
01:53:46.218 --> 01:53:47.743
BRIAN: This is one of our favorite games.

2261
01:53:47.743 --> 01:53:51.163
LIAM: "Did someone say games?!"

2262
01:53:51.163 --> 01:53:53.710
BRIAN: We heard there's a lot more critters that need names

2263
01:53:53.710 --> 01:53:55.570
so we actually got you one.

2264
01:53:55.570 --> 01:53:57.237
LIAM: "Oh, yeah?

2265
01:53:57.237 --> 01:53:59.244
"Well, what the hell is it?"

2266
01:53:59.244 --> 01:54:02.644
TRAVIS: (wheezing) And the one janky leg.

2267
01:54:02.644 --> 01:54:04.695
LIAM: "Now, listen, I feel harping on my injuries

2268
01:54:04.695 --> 01:54:07.038
"is beyond the pale, son."

2269
01:54:07.038 --> 01:54:11.168
BRIAN: No, we're not-- the name that was chosen for you

2270
01:54:11.168 --> 01:54:12.184
by everyone was--

2271
01:54:12.184 --> 01:54:13.814
LIAM: "And what the hell is it?"

2272
01:54:13.814 --> 01:54:15.238
BRIANL It was Tet'Nus Terry.

2273
01:54:15.238 --> 01:54:19.050
LIAM: "Well, fuck!

2274
01:54:19.050 --> 01:54:20.204
"I hate it."

2275
01:54:20.204 --> 01:54:21.293
TRAVIS: Yeah, yep.

2276
01:54:21.293 --> 01:54:22.883
BRIAN: That's actually a pretty good--

2277
01:54:22.883 --> 01:54:23.716
LIAM: "Now listen up!"

2278
01:54:23.716 --> 01:54:25.304
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

2279
01:54:25.304 --> 01:54:29.097
LIAM: "This place ain't all what it seems.

2280
01:54:29.097 --> 01:54:32.485
"It ain't all just blasting your six shooters

2281
01:54:32.485 --> 01:54:35.267
"and eating processed cheese bits.

2282
01:54:35.267 --> 01:54:38.888
"This place is a vessel."

2283
01:54:38.888 --> 01:54:40.724
BRIAN: A vessel?

2284
01:54:40.724 --> 01:54:41.858
A vessel to what?

2285
01:54:41.858 --> 01:54:43.247
LIAM: "Shut up, string bean."

2286
01:54:43.247 --> 01:54:44.645
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2287
01:54:44.645 --> 01:54:48.595
LIAM: "I was talking to the big one.

2288
01:54:48.595 --> 01:54:51.790
"The Game Ranch is like a mill

2289
01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:56.598
"and you boys need to start turning the wheel.

2290
01:54:56.598 --> 01:55:01.550
"Now, how you slackjaws do that is by playing games."

2291
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:02.609
TRAVIS: It's next level.

2292
01:55:02.609 --> 01:55:04.509
LIAM: "You keep doing that, big 'un,

2293
01:55:04.509 --> 01:55:07.240
"and your hootin' and hollerin'll charge it up

2294
01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:09.473
"for the big day."

2295
01:55:09.473 --> 01:55:11.720
BRIAN: Wait, the big day?

2296
01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.866
Did he say the big day?

2297
01:55:13.866 --> 01:55:17.039
Is that the prophecy that Ruby was talking about?

2298
01:55:17.039 --> 01:55:20.895
(laughter)

2299
01:55:20.895 --> 01:55:23.564
LIAM: "She told you about it, huh?

2300
01:55:23.564 --> 01:55:27.252
"Well, that's for her to explain.

2301
01:55:27.252 --> 01:55:30.089
"Now get to playing those games, boys,

2302
01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:33.046
"and start healing the rift.

2303
01:55:33.046 --> 01:55:37.665
"The gameverse is dependent on you!"

2304
01:55:37.665 --> 01:55:38.543
BRIAN: The rift?

2305
01:55:38.543 --> 01:55:40.651
BRIAN and TRAVIS: The gameverse?

2306
01:55:40.651 --> 01:55:43.907
BRIAN: Dude, which wood are you in, bro?

2307
01:55:43.907 --> 01:55:46.240
TRAVIS: (screaming)

2308
01:55:47.513 --> 01:55:49.013
BRIAN: How, how?
TRAVIS: Yee-haw!

2309
01:55:50.203 --> 01:55:52.936
BRIAN: I hit you with the knife at that last second.

2310
01:55:52.936 --> 01:55:54.022
I got kill of the game, though,

2311
01:55:54.022 --> 01:55:55.807
let's see what this is.
TRAVIS: Okay, let's watch it.

2312
01:55:55.807 --> 01:55:57.514
BRIAN: Oh, yeah, this was beautiful.

2313
01:55:57.514 --> 01:55:59.414
A clinic, a clinic.

2314
01:55:59.414 --> 01:56:01.672
TRAVIS: In the foot!

2315
01:56:01.672 --> 01:56:03.080
BRIAN: That wasn't in the foot!

2316
01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:03.922
TRAVIS: Where was it?

2317
01:56:03.922 --> 01:56:05.853
BRIAN: It was in his balls.

2318
01:56:05.853 --> 01:56:06.988
You would know if you had any,

2319
01:56:06.988 --> 01:56:07.821
if you weren't synthetic.

2320
01:56:07.821 --> 01:56:08.654
TRAVIS: Those are some

2321
01:56:08.654 --> 01:56:10.888
long balls, my friend.

2322
01:56:10.888 --> 01:56:12.029
Oh, I was so close.

2323
01:56:12.029 --> 01:56:13.379
BRIAN: I was really close.
TRAVIS: No, you weren't.

2324
01:56:13.379 --> 01:56:14.580
BRIAN: Okay, here we go.

2325
01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:17.116
Ten seconds, ten seconds, ten seconds, ten seconds!

2326
01:56:17.116 --> 01:56:21.399
Dude, Max sleeps on this carpet, it's disgusting.

2327
01:56:23.633 --> 01:56:26.517
Oh, you're still alive?

2328
01:56:27.616 --> 01:56:29.949
(screaming)

2329
01:56:31.261 --> 01:56:33.165
You motherfucker!

2330
01:56:33.165 --> 01:56:34.160
Where are you?

2331
01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:37.826
Hold still!
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

2332
01:56:37.826 --> 01:56:40.076
(laughter)

2333
01:56:42.770 --> 01:56:44.920

SAM: I'm Sam Riegel, I am a cast member of Critical Role

2348
01:58:09.598 --> 01:58:12.422
and I wrote the theme song for

2349
01:58:12.422 --> 01:58:16.522
the Legend of Vox Machina Animated Series.

2350
01:58:16.522 --> 01:58:18.768
TRAVIS: Actually, the way that happened

2351
01:58:18.768 --> 01:58:21.184
was me asking Sam, "Hey, you made that jingle

2352
01:58:21.184 --> 01:58:23.045
"for D&amp;D Beyond that was so incredible.

2353
01:58:23.045 --> 01:58:26.997
"Do you have any other stuff flying around you brain?"

2354
01:58:26.997 --> 01:58:29.809
And he sent me back an a capella version

2355
01:58:29.809 --> 01:58:31.515
of the song that he recorded one night

2356
01:58:31.515 --> 01:58:35.492
at 11:30 after his kids went to bed and it blew my mind.

2357
01:58:35.492 --> 01:58:37.933
SAM (VO): Okay, here's an idea.

2358
01:58:37.933 --> 01:58:39.193
Very basic.

2359
01:58:39.193 --> 01:58:43.993
The beat is like (vocalizing).

2360
01:58:43.993 --> 01:58:47.535
There will be drums (vocalizing).

2361
01:58:47.535 --> 01:58:50.062
The vocals are something like:

2362
01:58:50.062 --> 01:58:54.927
♪ The adventure begins, they were always beside you ♪

2363
01:58:54.927 --> 01:58:58.945
SAM: Taking my initial demo and turning it into

2364
01:58:58.945 --> 01:59:01.376
a really cool song, which it is,

2365
01:59:01.376 --> 01:59:03.118
it took a while, actually.

2366
01:59:03.118 --> 01:59:05.079
We needed real instruments because the first demo

2367
01:59:05.079 --> 01:59:07.136
was just me singing at an iPhone,

2368
01:59:07.136 --> 01:59:10.742
so we turned to our friend Jason Charles Miller

2369
01:59:10.742 --> 01:59:14.019
who did the original composition of the original theme song.

2370
01:59:14.019 --> 01:59:16.146
JASON: Well, it's funny because Sam called me

2371
01:59:16.146 --> 01:59:18.466
and he said, "Hey, I took your theme and

2372
01:59:18.466 --> 01:59:22.573
"I wrote lyrics to it and I put a melody over top of it."

2373
01:59:22.573 --> 01:59:25.327
I was like, "Okay, that's interesting, let me hear this,"

2374
01:59:25.327 --> 01:59:29.314
and he sent me this tape of him going,

2375
01:59:29.314 --> 01:59:31.353
"Roll, roll, critical, critical,"

2376
01:59:31.353 --> 01:59:34.158
like just him, all a capella over top of it.

2377
01:59:34.158 --> 01:59:36.197
When I heard it, I said "Okay, cool,

2378
01:59:36.197 --> 01:59:38.013
"then we can add this here and we can do that there

2379
01:59:38.013 --> 01:59:40.002
"and we can put the original melody back in here."

2380
01:59:40.002 --> 01:59:42.370
Then we had fun going back and forth with it.

2381
01:59:42.370 --> 01:59:47.356
SAM: Then we had even more players play on it,

2382
01:59:47.356 --> 01:59:51.272
so we got a violinist named Colm McGuinness--

2383
01:59:51.272 --> 01:59:53.956
I'm sure I'm saying that wrong-- to do violins for it.

2384
01:59:53.956 --> 01:59:58.157
We did some more drum work. We got my brother-in-law,

2385
01:59:58.157 --> 02:00:01.275
Peter Habib of the producing duo Mr. Fantastic.

2386
02:00:01.275 --> 02:00:04.673
They put in some thumping drums

2387
02:00:04.673 --> 02:00:06.857
and we kept pinging the song around

2388
02:00:06.857 --> 02:00:08.651
to all of these creators.

2389
02:00:08.651 --> 02:00:10.807
TRAVIS: Then when it came time to do vocals,

2390
02:00:10.807 --> 02:00:12.064
we had a bunch of different passes

2391
02:00:12.064 --> 02:00:12.897
and we were like, you know what,

2392
02:00:12.897 --> 02:00:13.968
we really need the ladies on this.

2393
02:00:13.968 --> 02:00:15.085
It would sound incredible

2394
02:00:15.085 --> 02:00:16.844
if Ashley and Laura would sing on it.

2395
02:00:16.844 --> 02:00:19.083
LAURA: Travis was the one that actually asked me

2396
02:00:19.083 --> 02:00:21.890
if I would be down to sing it

2397
02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:25.195
and I, of course, was very, very nervous. But, you know,

2398
02:00:25.195 --> 02:00:28.944
it was fun and I only got a little awkward

2399
02:00:28.944 --> 02:00:30.842
when I was in the booth, no big deal

2400
02:00:30.842 --> 02:00:32.583
because Travis was sitting right there.

2401
02:00:32.583 --> 02:00:35.103
I can look like an idiot in front of Sam,

2402
02:00:35.103 --> 02:00:36.747
but for some reason, I get really uncomfortable

2403
02:00:36.747 --> 02:00:38.722
if Travis is there, too.

2404
02:00:38.722 --> 02:00:41.151
TRAVIS: We sent a feeler out to our fantastic friends

2405
02:00:41.151 --> 02:00:44.152
over at Outloud Audio, the amazing Mark Kondracki

2406
02:00:44.152 --> 02:00:46.428
was kind enough to give us some studio time

2407
02:00:46.428 --> 02:00:48.638
to let us record that, one of the bigger spaces.

2408
02:00:48.638 --> 02:00:51.187
I think Ronin was just born,

2409
02:00:51.187 --> 02:00:53.779
so Laura was in there holding a little baby Ronin

2410
02:00:53.779 --> 02:00:58.192
while she was laying down those sick vocals on the song.

2411
02:00:58.192 --> 02:00:59.557
LAURA: I don't even remember how old he was.

2412
02:00:59.557 --> 02:01:04.225
I think he was only like, I want to say two months old,

2413
02:01:04.225 --> 02:01:06.113
maybe, when we were recording it.

2414
02:01:06.113 --> 02:01:07.282
I think he was younger.

2415
02:01:07.282 --> 02:01:10.458
He started crying when we were recording it.

2416
02:01:10.458 --> 02:01:12.689
SAM: We only had the studio for an hour

2417
02:01:12.689 --> 02:01:16.889
and it worked out that Laura had to feed her baby

2418
02:01:16.889 --> 02:01:18.774
while she was singing the song.

2419
02:01:18.774 --> 02:01:21.406
LAURA: What's weird is I think those were the

2420
02:01:21.406 --> 02:01:23.974
takes that we ended up using for the song because

2421
02:01:23.974 --> 02:01:26.744
for some reason, focusing on that

2422
02:01:26.744 --> 02:01:30.069
made it way more comfortable to actually do the singing.

2423
02:01:30.069 --> 02:01:33.780
SAM: I don't know if any suckling sounds

2424
02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:36.506
made it onto the track.

2425
02:01:36.506 --> 02:01:38.953
That will be cut. Anyway.

2426
02:01:38.953 --> 02:01:42.046
LAURA: When we were recording it, Sam kept going

2427
02:01:42.046 --> 02:01:44.511
"More rock and roll, more rock and roll!

2428
02:01:44.511 --> 02:01:46.566
"Go as over the top as you can sing!"

2429
02:01:46.566 --> 02:01:49.086
Because I guess I'm used to singing like

2430
02:01:49.086 --> 02:01:51.169
nicer sounding, sweeter sounding,

2431
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:54.309
and Sam wanted it like, "Ugh, I want grit!"

2432
02:01:54.309 --> 02:01:55.817
Any takes we did like that,

2433
02:01:55.817 --> 02:01:58.360
those were the ones they used. It was fun.

2434
02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:00.070
SAM: Then when Ashley recorded,

2435
02:02:00.070 --> 02:02:02.056
she came over to my house, actually,

2436
02:02:02.056 --> 02:02:03.723
which was a much smaller booth,

2437
02:02:03.723 --> 02:02:06.080
and she laid down her vocals late at night,

2438
02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:09.785
after she had been doing a video game job all day, I think.

2439
02:02:09.785 --> 02:02:13.774
She must have been exhausted but she didn't seem like it

2440
02:02:13.774 --> 02:02:17.228
because she just killed her side of the vocals as well.

2441
02:02:17.228 --> 02:02:20.900
I recorded her and lickety split, we were done.

2442
02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:23.738
TRAVIS: Yeah, Sam, you know, we were talking about

2443
02:02:23.738 --> 02:02:25.203
the rolls and the criticals, he was like,

2444
02:02:25.203 --> 02:02:26.843
"Hey, man, I pitched my voice down.

2445
02:02:26.843 --> 02:02:28.846
"You got a deep voice, do you want to go in and do it?"

2446
02:02:28.846 --> 02:02:30.303
I was like, "No, I love it the way it is."

2447
02:02:30.303 --> 02:02:33.045
He was like, "Nah, come on, let's really go in there."

2448
02:02:33.045 --> 02:02:35.650
So my contribution to the piece

2449
02:02:35.650 --> 02:02:36.999
was actually going into the booth

2450
02:02:36.999 --> 02:02:40.308
and bouncing as I did it and going, "Roll!

2451
02:02:40.308 --> 02:02:42.608
"Critical, roll!"

2452
02:02:42.608 --> 02:02:46.136
Trying to sound as tough and determined as I could

2453
02:02:46.136 --> 02:02:48.215
even though I could see all of their laughing faces

2454
02:02:48.215 --> 02:02:51.077
as I bounced up and down like a little baby.

2455
02:02:51.077 --> 02:02:53.967
SAM: I was going for a little bit of a retro vibe

2456
02:02:53.967 --> 02:02:54.941
for the lyrics.

2457
02:02:54.941 --> 02:02:58.491
I knew that one of the motifs we were going to try to do

2458
02:02:58.491 --> 02:03:02.210
was just the chance of it all,

2459
02:03:02.210 --> 02:03:04.735
like taking a chance,

2460
02:03:04.735 --> 02:03:08.288
putting the fate in your own hands,

2461
02:03:08.288 --> 02:03:09.279
like deciding your fate.

2462
02:03:09.279 --> 02:03:13.385
That's a cool element of our game.

2463
02:03:13.385 --> 02:03:14.851
Critical Role is just like

2464
02:03:14.851 --> 02:03:16.750
you don't know what's going to happen,

2465
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:18.854
you don't know where the story's going to lead,

2466
02:03:18.854 --> 02:03:20.574
so you just have to go for it.

2467
02:03:20.574 --> 02:03:22.357
LAURA: I think the thing that sticks out the most

2468
02:03:22.357 --> 02:03:25.607
is the roll the dice part of it because

2469
02:03:26.865 --> 02:03:31.304
Vex was always one to take chances. But, I don't know.

2470
02:03:31.304 --> 02:03:33.389
"Daggers and cunning" is pretty fricking cool

2471
02:03:33.389 --> 02:03:35.173
that we took it there.

2472
02:03:35.173 --> 02:03:37.616
Just that little change, that made me pretty happy.

2473
02:03:37.616 --> 02:03:41.701
TRAVIS: I think the lyrics for Your Turn To Roll embody

2474
02:03:41.701 --> 02:03:44.260
really, sort of the spirit of our early home game,

2475
02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:47.265
which is like, a bunch of friends getting together,

2476
02:03:47.265 --> 02:03:49.193
being nerdy as hell, rolling some dice,

2477
02:03:49.193 --> 02:03:51.230
not really caring what comes out of your mouth

2478
02:03:51.230 --> 02:03:54.662
or who's watching or what other people think of you.

2479
02:03:54.662 --> 02:03:57.493
You're going to take on brave, courageous personas,

2480
02:03:57.493 --> 02:03:59.725
try and right wrongs, or maybe cause wrongs

2481
02:03:59.725 --> 02:04:00.990
depending on what your character is

2482
02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:03.050
and just jumping into that adventure

2483
02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:05.927
and letting yourself go and when the time comes,

2484
02:04:05.927 --> 02:04:07.224
roll the dice and see what happens.

2485
02:04:07.224 --> 02:04:11.320
It's an adventuring party for a reason, right?

2486
02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:14.070
[dramatic music]

2487
02:04:32.850 --> 02:04:35.600
[dramatic music]

2488
02:17:47.189 --> 02:17:49.169
MATT: And welcome back everyone.

2489
02:17:49.169 --> 02:17:52.027
Well done, Laura!

2490
02:17:52.027 --> 02:17:56.352
First and foremost, we have our winner of the giveaway.

2491
02:17:56.352 --> 02:18:00.307
The winner of the Wyrmwood monkeywood tabletop tiles

2492
02:18:00.307 --> 02:18:02.740
from their Kickstarter is SlyEladrin.

2493
02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:06.666
(cheering)
SlyEladrin, congratulations.

2494
02:18:06.666 --> 02:18:08.852
It would be, yeah, from what court, though?

2495
02:18:08.852 --> 02:18:11.650
So yes-- or I should say what season.

2496
02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:13.276
You go ahead and we'll get that sent out to you ASAP,

2497
02:18:13.276 --> 02:18:14.221
congratulations.

2498
02:18:14.221 --> 02:18:17.608
Secondly, we found out during the break that

2499
02:18:17.608 --> 02:18:21.665
somehow, I don't know, I can't be surprised anymore,

2500
02:18:21.665 --> 02:18:24.231
you guys pushed through the Kickstarter

2501
02:18:24.231 --> 02:18:26.302
to the 8.8 million stretch goal

2502
02:18:26.302 --> 02:18:28.308
during the first half of the game tonight.

2503
02:18:28.308 --> 02:18:33.308
So here's some motherfucking cheers, guys!

2504
02:18:33.308 --> 02:18:35.497
MARISHA: To Critters!

2505
02:18:35.497 --> 02:18:37.851
LIAM: To critters, to you guys, 100%!

2506
02:18:37.851 --> 02:18:42.851
MATT: This unfathomably incredible community

2507
02:18:43.192 --> 02:18:48.192
of wonderful, supportive, positive, creative,

2508
02:18:49.217 --> 02:18:51.791
force for good that exists in this world.

2509
02:18:51.791 --> 02:18:53.894
We are so thankful and grateful

2510
02:18:53.894 --> 02:18:56.976
that we're even but a small nugget in the core of this

2511
02:18:56.976 --> 02:18:58.045
and you guys take this and carry

2512
02:18:58.045 --> 02:19:01.019
that positivity in the world and have supported this

2513
02:19:01.019 --> 02:19:03.010
and us to a degree that we could never, ever

2514
02:19:03.010 --> 02:19:05.667
have ever expected and we'll continue to do our best

2515
02:19:05.667 --> 02:19:07.631
to pay that forward in all ways we can.

2516
02:19:07.631 --> 02:19:09.646
This show is going to be incredible

2517
02:19:09.646 --> 02:19:12.693
and we're making it so incredible for you guys.

2518
02:19:12.693 --> 02:19:14.857
Thank you so much.

2519
02:19:14.857 --> 02:19:16.448
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2520
02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:17.432
SAM: L'Chaim.

2521
02:19:17.432 --> 02:19:22.169
LIAM: Has there ever been a bigger passion project?

2522
02:19:23.824 --> 02:19:25.882
No.

2523
02:19:28.121 --> 02:19:30.673
TRAVIS: (coughing) That's good champagne.

2524
02:19:30.673 --> 02:19:32.047
MARISHA: Did you get a good rip?

2525
02:19:32.047 --> 02:19:33.571
TRAVIS: In my lungs.

2526
02:19:33.571 --> 02:19:36.778
(laughter)

2527
02:19:36.778 --> 02:19:37.703
LIAM: Thank you.

2528
02:19:37.703 --> 02:19:38.795
MATT: Holy shit, thank you, guys.

2529
02:19:38.795 --> 02:19:40.466
LAURA: Eyes, eyes, eyes.

2530
02:19:40.466 --> 02:19:43.531
ALL: Eyes, eyes, eyes.

2531
02:19:43.531 --> 02:19:46.480
SAM: That's going to look so creepy.

2532
02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:48.179
LIAM: Does the rest of the world know that that's a thing

2533
02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:49.164
or is it just us?

2534
02:19:49.164 --> 02:19:52.864
TRAVIS: You've got to make eye contact when you cheers.

2535
02:19:52.864 --> 02:19:54.619
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a thing.

2536
02:19:54.619 --> 02:19:57.557
LIAM: It is not, but we totally do it in Critical Role Land.

2537
02:19:57.557 --> 02:19:59.043
MATT: Champagne's weird.

2538
02:19:59.043 --> 02:20:00.818
LAURA: Oh my god, it's so good.

2539
02:20:00.818 --> 02:20:02.176
LIAM: Sure is.

2540
02:20:02.176 --> 02:20:04.527
MATT: So.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2541
02:20:04.527 --> 02:20:07.005
LAURA: (yelling)

2542
02:20:07.005 --> 02:20:08.300
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

2543
02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:11.216
MARISHA: Oh my god, back in the game. Head back in the game.

2544
02:20:11.216 --> 02:20:13.301
TRAVIS: Making cartoons, you guys.

2545
02:20:13.301 --> 02:20:15.403
MATT: I know!

2546
02:20:15.403 --> 02:20:18.045
LAURA: Oh my god, though, like, what?

2547
02:20:18.045 --> 02:20:21.020
MATT: All that's left, everything this point

2548
02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:23.562
just goes towards making the animation better,

2549
02:20:23.562 --> 02:20:25.676
to the animation team, the developer,

2550
02:20:25.676 --> 02:20:28.801
the people that are making this project.

2551
02:20:28.801 --> 02:20:31.354
Yeah. It's going to be good.

2552
02:20:31.354 --> 02:20:32.754
TALIESIN: Just going to be great.

2553
02:20:32.754 --> 02:20:37.272
MATT: Oh, god, all right, so, back in.

2554
02:20:37.272 --> 02:20:38.845
So.

2555
02:20:38.845 --> 02:20:42.253
Having been led out of the Shadowshire,

2556
02:20:42.253 --> 02:20:46.352
you are brought through the area known as the Firmaments.

2557
02:20:46.352 --> 02:20:49.002
It is a district,

2558
02:20:49.002 --> 02:20:52.652
similarly beautiful to the

2559
02:20:52.652 --> 02:20:57.510
area around the Lucid Bastion.

2560
02:20:58.580 --> 02:21:01.365
Less religious-based architecture.

2561
02:21:01.365 --> 02:21:05.009
The geometry that was inherent around elements

2562
02:21:05.009 --> 02:21:08.801
of the Lucid Bastion and the surrounding buildings

2563
02:21:08.801 --> 02:21:11.299
of worship seems to continue on somewhat

2564
02:21:11.299 --> 02:21:15.637
into the Firmaments, but here there seems to be

2565
02:21:15.637 --> 02:21:18.987
a lot more locations for restful reading.

2566
02:21:18.987 --> 02:21:23.137
You can see small, lightless gardens

2567
02:21:23.137 --> 02:21:27.010
with elements of grass that seems to

2568
02:21:27.010 --> 02:21:30.784
not require daylight to subsist.

2569
02:21:30.784 --> 02:21:34.711
These beautiful little nooks where you can see

2570
02:21:34.711 --> 02:21:38.031
people of the drow populace sitting and reading

2571
02:21:38.031 --> 02:21:40.052
and paying strange attention to you.

2572
02:21:40.052 --> 02:21:41.709
Once again, it's hard not to draw attention

2573
02:21:41.709 --> 02:21:43.425
when you guys pass by with

2574
02:21:43.425 --> 02:21:47.936
one of the members of Den Thelyss.

2575
02:21:47.936 --> 02:21:49.298
As you're brought through,

2576
02:21:49.298 --> 02:21:51.939
you can see these beautiful sculptures,

2577
02:21:51.939 --> 02:21:53.622
these spire-like pointed towers

2578
02:21:53.622 --> 02:21:55.165
that curve towards the top.

2579
02:21:55.165 --> 02:21:57.152
You don't know if they're just art pieces

2580
02:21:57.152 --> 02:22:00.218
or if there's a specific intent to their construction

2581
02:22:00.218 --> 02:22:03.090
but there's one every two blocks or so

2582
02:22:03.090 --> 02:22:05.363
throughout this district.

2583
02:22:05.363 --> 02:22:07.383
At one point, the Shadowhand stops

2584
02:22:07.383 --> 02:22:09.873
and points at the left to this

2585
02:22:09.873 --> 02:22:12.691
beautiful series of structures

2586
02:22:12.691 --> 02:22:15.701
with two towers, not terribly tall.

2587
02:22:15.701 --> 02:22:18.909
You're used to seeing elements of the Soltryce Academy,

2588
02:22:18.909 --> 02:22:22.995
which definitely-- oh, god, that's right, we're there now.

2589
02:22:22.995 --> 02:22:25.995
TRAVIS: That thing is bigger than my wife.

2590
02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:30.770
SAM: It's filled with yummy water.

2591
02:22:30.770 --> 02:22:32.530
TRAVIS: Is it-- oh god.

2592
02:22:32.530 --> 02:22:34.864
Oh my god.

2593
02:22:34.864 --> 02:22:36.145
Okay, pace yourself.
TALIESIN: You can put messages

2594
02:22:36.145 --> 02:22:37.085
on the bottom of that now.

2595
02:22:37.085 --> 02:22:39.978
You actually have more space for--

2596
02:22:39.978 --> 02:22:41.570
SAM: There's entire ice cubes in here.

2597
02:22:41.570 --> 02:22:43.820
(laughter)

2598
02:22:46.153 --> 02:22:47.963
MATT: Oh, man.

2599
02:22:47.963 --> 02:22:49.104
That's terrifying and the water spill

2600
02:22:49.104 --> 02:22:51.537
gave me a William Wallace thing going on, so I'll take that.

2601
02:22:51.537 --> 02:22:53.853
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, on half your face!

2602
02:22:54.856 --> 02:22:56.897
MATT: You can take our lives.

2603
02:22:56.897 --> 02:22:58.835
SAM: That's strong water.

2604
02:22:58.835 --> 02:23:02.694
MATT: The Shadowhand points off to the structure.

2605
02:23:02.694 --> 02:23:05.663
You can see the two towers that bookend

2606
02:23:05.663 --> 02:23:08.678
the two sides of it, but it's a series of adjoining hallways

2607
02:23:08.678 --> 02:23:13.369
that are somewhat rounded on the top,

2608
02:23:13.369 --> 02:23:17.126
it's like a semi-cylindrical shape,

2609
02:23:17.126 --> 02:23:19.154
but the hall itself meets to the bottom

2610
02:23:19.154 --> 02:23:21.373
and they are adjoined to all.

2611
02:23:21.373 --> 02:23:25.250
It looks like a really elaborate college campus

2612
02:23:25.250 --> 02:23:28.689
series of connecting halls and central buildings

2613
02:23:28.689 --> 02:23:29.814
that are domed.

2614
02:23:29.814 --> 02:23:31.774
LAURA: Are there drow playing hacky sack?

2615
02:23:31.774 --> 02:23:33.031
MATT: Yeah.

2616
02:23:33.031 --> 02:23:35.894
It's Rush out there right now.

2617
02:23:35.894 --> 02:23:37.468
SAM: They're putting out fliers for their

2618
02:23:37.468 --> 02:23:38.433
acapella auditions.

2619
02:23:38.433 --> 02:23:41.061
LIAM: Goddamn it!

2620
02:23:41.061 --> 02:23:44.560
I was waiting my turn and you jumped on it.

2621
02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:47.067
MATT: You can see through a lot of the beautiful,

2622
02:23:47.067 --> 02:23:50.967
tall, glass windows that also come to the rounded tops,

2623
02:23:50.967 --> 02:23:53.263
a glow from the inside, a warm,

2624
02:23:53.263 --> 02:23:57.021
yellow and orange flicker.

2625
02:23:57.021 --> 02:23:58.642
The Shadowhand points and goes,

2626
02:23:58.642 --> 02:24:02.122
"If you remember one of the things that was spoken of,

2627
02:24:02.122 --> 02:24:04.919
"the Marble Tomes Conservatory.

2628
02:24:04.919 --> 02:24:08.666
"That would be where you would find the professor,

2629
02:24:08.666 --> 02:24:11.619
"should you be interested in looking

2630
02:24:11.619 --> 02:24:15.456
"for one avenue of income or questioning."

2631
02:24:15.456 --> 02:24:16.831
LIAM: Appreciated.

2632
02:24:16.831 --> 02:24:19.131
MATT: "Of course.

2633
02:24:19.131 --> 02:24:21.209
"This way."

2634
02:24:21.209 --> 02:24:24.434
Pressing on through the Firmaments,

2635
02:24:24.434 --> 02:24:29.434
you come to the next wall, the next large, 15-foot barrier

2636
02:24:29.442 --> 02:24:31.607
that stands between each of these various sects.

2637
02:24:31.607 --> 02:24:34.403
It's an outward onion-layer type layout,

2638
02:24:34.403 --> 02:24:35.751
from best you can tell.

2639
02:24:35.751 --> 02:24:37.703
More circular towards the center

2640
02:24:37.703 --> 02:24:39.280
and a little more oblong and strange shape

2641
02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:41.065
as it progresses outward and the districts

2642
02:24:41.065 --> 02:24:42.836
get wider and wider.

2643
02:24:42.836 --> 02:24:44.484
As you come towards the base of the hill looking out,

2644
02:24:44.484 --> 02:24:45.831
you get a better view.

2645
02:24:45.831 --> 02:24:49.198
There's what you now figure is the Gallimaufry,

2646
02:24:49.198 --> 02:24:50.848
which is the one you're going into.

2647
02:24:50.848 --> 02:24:54.419
There's one beyond that which looks a little more clustered,

2648
02:24:54.419 --> 02:24:56.919
you see a series of buildings that look

2649
02:24:56.919 --> 02:24:59.462
built upon each other in a way that has

2650
02:24:59.462 --> 02:25:01.115
not a lot of rhyme and reason to it.

2651
02:25:01.115 --> 02:25:05.274
However, being to Asarius and you having your experience

2652
02:25:05.274 --> 02:25:10.132
with goblin villages, you do see elements here

2653
02:25:10.132 --> 02:25:13.021
where it looks like there are clusters of neighborhoods

2654
02:25:13.021 --> 02:25:15.196
that include a lot of the non-drow folk

2655
02:25:15.196 --> 02:25:18.596
that have been brought into the Dynasty as well.

2656
02:25:18.596 --> 02:25:21.974
Nowhere near as numerous as Asarius,

2657
02:25:21.974 --> 02:25:23.656
but you see elements that lead you to believe

2658
02:25:23.656 --> 02:25:24.887
kind of the further out you go,

2659
02:25:24.887 --> 02:25:28.674
the more diverse peoples you'll find

2660
02:25:28.674 --> 02:25:29.699
mixing in with the township.

2661
02:25:29.699 --> 02:25:31.174
SAM: Does it seem,

2662
02:25:31.174 --> 02:25:35.779
from the general presentation of those areas,

2663
02:25:35.779 --> 02:25:38.804
that those are

2664
02:25:38.804 --> 02:25:41.796
of a lesser quality of life?

2665
02:25:41.796 --> 02:25:44.081
MATT: You're not close enough to see.

2666
02:25:44.081 --> 02:25:47.063
You're just seeing the cusp and this is still a ways out.

2667
02:25:47.063 --> 02:25:49.588
Because you're coming down the end

2668
02:25:49.588 --> 02:25:51.038
of this gradual grade of the large hill

2669
02:25:51.038 --> 02:25:52.423
that the center of the city's built upon,

2670
02:25:52.423 --> 02:25:56.035
you can just make out those aspects to catch your eye.

2671
02:25:56.035 --> 02:25:59.072
Beyond that, it's dark.

2672
02:25:59.072 --> 02:26:01.142
Like the lanterns just stop.

2673
02:26:01.142 --> 02:26:04.902
Now that you're getting low,

2674
02:26:04.902 --> 02:26:09.871
and a little bit of the elements of

2675
02:26:09.871 --> 02:26:11.734
whether, be fake or not, you do not see a moon in the sky,

2676
02:26:11.734 --> 02:26:15.662
but there is a slight rim of false moonlight

2677
02:26:15.662 --> 02:26:19.827
that is projected upon elements of the distant stone shapes

2678
02:26:19.827 --> 02:26:22.512
and you can see on the horizon, in that dark space,

2679
02:26:22.512 --> 02:26:24.705
jagged shapes.

2680
02:26:24.705 --> 02:26:28.492
Whether they be broken ruins or abandoned constructs,

2681
02:26:28.492 --> 02:26:31.137
you cannot see, but they appear to be large

2682
02:26:31.137 --> 02:26:35.372
and definitely devoid of light.

2683
02:26:35.372 --> 02:26:38.881
Nevertheless, you pass through that barrier wall,

2684
02:26:38.881 --> 02:26:42.072
through an arched door,

2685
02:26:42.072 --> 02:26:44.241
but this one comes to more of a point,

2686
02:26:44.241 --> 02:26:46.206
a zenith point towards the top,

2687
02:26:46.206 --> 02:26:48.503
walking through into the Gallimaufry,

2688
02:26:48.503 --> 02:26:51.976
as it's introduced to you by the Shadowhand.

2689
02:26:51.976 --> 02:26:55.443
Already, you can hear music,

2690
02:26:55.443 --> 02:27:00.443
but strange, mixing elements.

2691
02:27:00.704 --> 02:27:02.158
Like 3rd Street Promenade,

2692
02:27:02.158 --> 02:27:03.436
where you have four or five styles

2693
02:27:03.436 --> 02:27:05.567
all hitting at once in that central thoroughfare

2694
02:27:05.567 --> 02:27:08.029
and it becomes a jumble.

2695
02:27:08.029 --> 02:27:10.194
You can hear drumbeats, but beats that conflict

2696
02:27:10.194 --> 02:27:12.591
from different edges that end up making this weird,

2697
02:27:12.591 --> 02:27:17.591
unhappy mixture.

2698
02:27:18.095 --> 02:27:19.619
TALIESIN: Unhappy mixture.

2699
02:27:19.619 --> 02:27:21.789
MATT: You can hear some reed instruments,

2700
02:27:21.789 --> 02:27:23.769
though they're kind of off.

2701
02:27:23.769 --> 02:27:27.882
As you know, goblins tend to prefer percussion

2702
02:27:27.882 --> 02:27:30.770
and very loud, discordant reeds.

2703
02:27:30.770 --> 02:27:33.323
There's definitely elements of that there.

2704
02:27:33.323 --> 02:27:34.656
SAM: Drum and bass.

2705
02:27:36.212 --> 02:27:38.423
TALIESIN: EDM.

2706
02:27:38.423 --> 02:27:40.308
MATT: Goblins more of a drum and bass thing.

2707
02:27:40.308 --> 02:27:44.624
Drow's more EDM, I think. Trance.

2708
02:27:44.624 --> 02:27:46.124
LIAM: Especially here.

2709
02:27:48.237 --> 02:27:52.551
MATT: You step into the new district,

2710
02:27:52.551 --> 02:27:56.222
the familiar drow buildings and architecture continue,

2711
02:27:56.222 --> 02:27:59.583
but you begin to see more classic structures,

2712
02:27:59.583 --> 02:28:03.628
more of the familiar inn buildings,

2713
02:28:03.628 --> 02:28:08.583
the more familiar classic, imperial design,

2714
02:28:08.583 --> 02:28:12.124
but a makeshift variation of it,

2715
02:28:12.124 --> 02:28:13.754
whether it be different type of materials

2716
02:28:13.754 --> 02:28:16.137
that were made to build it or

2717
02:28:16.137 --> 02:28:19.298
it was a standard, cultural design

2718
02:28:19.298 --> 02:28:24.298
outside of what the drow brought to what is now Rosohna.

2719
02:28:25.009 --> 02:28:29.682
You continue forward and, still, a mostly drow populous,

2720
02:28:29.682 --> 02:28:33.298
but you begin to see the errant bugbear,

2721
02:28:33.298 --> 02:28:37.342
coming in pairs or groups.

2722
02:28:37.342 --> 02:28:39.499
You can see carts being wheeled through the streets,

2723
02:28:39.499 --> 02:28:41.535
commerce comes into play here.

2724
02:28:41.535 --> 02:28:43.592
Previously, you had not really seen much sign

2725
02:28:43.592 --> 02:28:45.958
of any sort of shops or buildings

2726
02:28:45.958 --> 02:28:48.049
when it came to the Firmament or near the Bastion,

2727
02:28:48.049 --> 02:28:53.000
but here you begin to see a bustling

2728
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.270
center of society and civilization here in the capital.

2729
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:59.967
There are all sorts of strange smells:

2730
02:28:59.967 --> 02:29:04.960
very pungent fish and seafood type scents,

2731
02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:06.048
which is unique.

2732
02:29:06.048 --> 02:29:07.554
You didn't know there was a sea nearby,

2733
02:29:07.554 --> 02:29:11.599
but, apparently, there is a seafood source.

2734
02:29:11.599 --> 02:29:14.134
You can smell cooked meats and

2735
02:29:14.134 --> 02:29:17.342
things like steamed vegetables, but the smell

2736
02:29:17.342 --> 02:29:22.005
has more of a rancid pungence to it.

2737
02:29:22.005 --> 02:29:24.012
You would recognize elements of it.

2738
02:29:24.012 --> 02:29:29.012
A lot of these are subterranean root-based vegetables,

2739
02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:32.113
tubers and things like that that.

2740
02:29:32.113 --> 02:29:35.486
In this region, when steamed and baked,

2741
02:29:35.486 --> 02:29:37.951
give off a little more of a unique smell.

2742
02:29:37.951 --> 02:29:40.686
It's not pleasant to you, most of you, at least,

2743
02:29:40.686 --> 02:29:43.048
but it is food and you're finding

2744
02:29:43.048 --> 02:29:44.480
yourselves a little hungry.

2745
02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:46.463
TALIESIN: I like a good yam.

2746
02:29:46.463 --> 02:29:50.778
MATT: You do see strings of these green lanterns,

2747
02:29:50.778 --> 02:29:53.430
strung from edge-to-edge.

2748
02:29:53.430 --> 02:29:56.499
They're smaller and the light is not quite as intense,

2749
02:29:56.499 --> 02:29:58.776
they're more there for decor.

2750
02:29:58.776 --> 02:30:00.569
There's a generally more jovial

2751
02:30:00.569 --> 02:30:03.297
and celebratory feel to this

2752
02:30:03.297 --> 02:30:07.051
than the very stoic and in some ways

2753
02:30:07.051 --> 02:30:09.328
faith-based streets you've walked

2754
02:30:09.328 --> 02:30:11.791
since you left the Bastion.

2755
02:30:11.791 --> 02:30:14.335
Following the Shadowhand as he beelines you

2756
02:30:14.335 --> 02:30:19.335
around the corner, you see a large, three-story structure

2757
02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:24.094
made of that similar, purple-ish,

2758
02:30:24.094 --> 02:30:26.592
in some ways brown, depending on how the light hits it,

2759
02:30:26.592 --> 02:30:30.330
wood that you saw the outskirts of Asarius'

2760
02:30:30.330 --> 02:30:33.036
main walls constructed from.

2761
02:30:33.036 --> 02:30:36.460
Whatever wood seems to be used in this area

2762
02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:39.312
is predominantly this color.

2763
02:30:39.312 --> 02:30:41.032
You see it in a lot of the buildings and constructs

2764
02:30:41.032 --> 02:30:42.399
that start to go into wood frames

2765
02:30:42.399 --> 02:30:45.555
around the stonework and everything.

2766
02:30:45.555 --> 02:30:48.516
Purple and a deep maroon seems to be a color

2767
02:30:48.516 --> 02:30:52.326
that comes up often here, in the use of wood.

2768
02:30:52.326 --> 02:30:55.854
Approaching, you see a sign that hangs from the outside.

2769
02:30:55.854 --> 02:30:59.681
It has three different titles in it.

2770
02:30:59.681 --> 02:31:03.528
Any of you speak Undercommon?

2771
02:31:03.528 --> 02:31:05.132
TALIESIN: No.

2772
02:31:05.132 --> 02:31:07.677
MATT: So you do not recognize one element.

2773
02:31:07.677 --> 02:31:09.678
There is a Common phrasing beneath it, though,

2774
02:31:09.678 --> 02:31:13.005
that says The Dim's Inn and you recognize this

2775
02:31:13.005 --> 02:31:14.326
as your destination.

2776
02:31:14.326 --> 02:31:16.622
MARISHA: What's the third language?

2777
02:31:16.622 --> 02:31:19.303
MATT: The third language would be Abyssal.

2778
02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:21.660
TRAVIS: Yasha speaks "Abyshal." "Abyshal"?

2779
02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:23.912
MATT: Abyssal, yeah.

2780
02:31:23.912 --> 02:31:26.286
(chuckles)

2781
02:31:26.286 --> 02:31:28.110
MATT: Yeah, Yasha glaces up and goes,

2782
02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:32.150
"Oh, yeah, it says The Dim's Inn."

2783
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:34.938
LIAM: We found the Rosetta Stone.

2784
02:31:34.938 --> 02:31:37.822
MATT: This is the one, guys.

2785
02:31:37.822 --> 02:31:40.765
From the outside, you could already hear the loud chatter.

2786
02:31:40.765 --> 02:31:45.578
As you enter, it's not a large entrance by any means.

2787
02:31:45.578 --> 02:31:49.674
It's separated in the clerk's desk on the side

2788
02:31:49.674 --> 02:31:54.008
that is well-made and well-polished

2789
02:31:54.008 --> 02:31:55.641
and, actually, of all the wood you've seen,

2790
02:31:55.641 --> 02:31:57.515
this is probably wood that's been imported abroad elsewhere

2791
02:31:57.515 --> 02:31:59.505
because this is a standard, dark mahogany,

2792
02:31:59.505 --> 02:32:00.713
versus the rest of the interior

2793
02:32:00.713 --> 02:32:04.351
that contains that maroon color towards it.

2794
02:32:04.351 --> 02:32:07.818
You see maybe seven tables,

2795
02:32:07.818 --> 02:32:10.488
of which half of them are currently in use.

2796
02:32:10.488 --> 02:32:13.682
There are all manner of worker drow

2797
02:32:13.682 --> 02:32:15.828
that seem to be in standard, everyday clothing,

2798
02:32:15.828 --> 02:32:17.828
as opposed to the armored and regal figures

2799
02:32:17.828 --> 02:32:19.328
that you seem to have been interacting with

2800
02:32:19.328 --> 02:32:21.881
primarily since you came here.

2801
02:32:21.881 --> 02:32:26.881
As well as one very, very, very drunk ogre

2802
02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:29.162
sitting at a table playing cards

2803
02:32:29.162 --> 02:32:30.588
with two other drow

2804
02:32:30.588 --> 02:32:32.881
who are getting predominantly more and more

2805
02:32:32.881 --> 02:32:34.822
frustrated with him, as he's loud and boisterous

2806
02:32:34.822 --> 02:32:36.546
and slamming the table and

2807
02:32:36.546 --> 02:32:38.622
dropping cards and picking them up.

2808
02:32:38.622 --> 02:32:40.165
Apparently, they're making a lot of money off of him

2809
02:32:40.165 --> 02:32:41.650
because they're not causing much of a stir

2810
02:32:41.650 --> 02:32:44.717
and you see them taking hand after hand.

2811
02:32:44.717 --> 02:32:49.426
Over by the clerk's counter, you see a

2812
02:32:49.426 --> 02:32:54.425
very well-groomed male dark elf.

2813
02:32:55.283 --> 02:32:59.070
Has a pencil-white mustache,

2814
02:32:59.070 --> 02:33:02.383
goes across the very essence of John Waters.

2815
02:33:02.383 --> 02:33:05.807
LIAM: Drow John Waters! I like it.

2816
02:33:06.808 --> 02:33:11.808
MATT: His eyes, his irises are a very light,

2817
02:33:12.375 --> 02:33:15.357
yellow-orange color around the pupil,

2818
02:33:15.357 --> 02:33:17.706
and his short white hair is slicked.

2819
02:33:17.706 --> 02:33:19.106
Not quite a comb over,

2820
02:33:19.106 --> 02:33:20.573
but like it's parted on one side and pulled over.

2821
02:33:20.573 --> 02:33:22.573
TALIESIN: John Waters, it's just John Waters, please.

2822
02:33:22.573 --> 02:33:23.406
MATT: Kind of!

2823
02:33:23.406 --> 02:33:25.899
TALIESIN: Thank you. That's all I want.

2824
02:33:25.899 --> 02:33:28.094
MARISHA: I'm just writing down "drow John Waters."

2825
02:33:28.094 --> 02:33:29.045
TALIESIN: Drow Waters.

2826
02:33:29.045 --> 02:33:32.328
MATT: Drow Waters, there you go.

2827
02:33:32.328 --> 02:33:35.871
Looking in your direction as you enter.

2828
02:33:35.871 --> 02:33:39.013
MARISHA: I'm going to do my subversive hood side,

2829
02:33:39.013 --> 02:33:44.012
by the way. Well, I would have done that walking through.

2830
02:33:44.012 --> 02:33:47.182
MATT: As you enter, he's in the process of

2831
02:33:47.182 --> 02:33:49.823
reading through and double checking two of his ledgers

2832
02:33:49.823 --> 02:33:53.762
and glances over, "Um," and sees the Shadowhand and goes,

2833
02:33:53.762 --> 02:33:55.945
"Oh, well, this is a surprise.

2834
02:33:55.945 --> 02:34:00.645
"What draws the Shadowhand to our

2835
02:34:00.645 --> 02:34:05.461
"very humble place of business?"

2836
02:34:05.461 --> 02:34:10.353
The Shadowhand goes, "Yes, we have

2837
02:34:10.353 --> 02:34:14.460
"friends of the Bright Queen who are staying."

2838
02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:16.805
You guys show off your emblems.

2839
02:34:16.805 --> 02:34:19.548
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

2840
02:34:19.548 --> 02:34:22.898
MATT: "They are to stay, for the time being,

2841
02:34:22.898 --> 02:34:27.163
at the Dynasty's dime."

2842
02:34:27.163 --> 02:34:27.996
TRAVIS: Shit.

2843
02:34:27.996 --> 02:34:30.187
MARISHA: Business expense.

2844
02:34:31.308 --> 02:34:32.924
MATT: "For the time being.

2845
02:34:32.924 --> 02:34:37.083
"Until they decide what their intent is

2846
02:34:37.083 --> 02:34:40.369
"based on the Queen's last request.

2847
02:34:40.369 --> 02:34:44.991
"Take care of them and should you need anything,

2848
02:34:44.991 --> 02:34:47.957
"well, we'll know," and he turns and leaves.

2849
02:34:47.957 --> 02:34:48.790
SAM: He's leaving?

2850
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:50.165
MATT: He turns to leave, yeah.

2851
02:34:50.165 --> 02:34:51.606
SAM: Excuse me.

2852
02:34:51.606 --> 02:34:52.664
MATT: Stops.

2853
02:34:52.664 --> 02:34:54.919
SAM: Essek?

2854
02:34:54.919 --> 02:34:58.916
I know that, we trust that you won't,

2855
02:34:58.916 --> 02:35:02.629
that we're not being watched at all times, but

2856
02:35:02.629 --> 02:35:07.629
is an eye being kept out for our general movements

2857
02:35:07.849 --> 02:35:11.432
or actions or do we?

2858
02:35:11.432 --> 02:35:14.655
MATT: "What do you think?"

2859
02:35:14.655 --> 02:35:16.439
SAM: A little bit?

2860
02:35:16.439 --> 02:35:18.929
MATT: "Maybe."

2861
02:35:18.929 --> 02:35:23.929
SAM: Okay. Great, just wanted to know.

2862
02:35:24.612 --> 02:35:26.646
MATT: "Of course."

2863
02:35:26.646 --> 02:35:28.112
TRAVIS: Could I ask,

2864
02:35:28.112 --> 02:35:31.495
is there anywhere we are not allowed to go?

2865
02:35:31.495 --> 02:35:34.241
MATT: "I would recommend not going into the Ghostlands.

2866
02:35:34.241 --> 02:35:35.626
"That would end poorly."

2867
02:35:35.626 --> 02:35:37.090
MARISHA: The Ghostlands?

2868
02:35:37.090 --> 02:35:39.124
TRAVIS: Normally, I have an aversion to something

2869
02:35:39.124 --> 02:35:40.774
named like that, but good point.

2870
02:35:40.774 --> 02:35:44.087
MATT: "Yes. That's beyond the walls of the Corona District.

2871
02:35:44.087 --> 02:35:46.103
"It's the outside of the city."

2872
02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:47.732
LAURA: Is that the dark stuff?

2873
02:35:47.732 --> 02:35:51.829
MATT: "There's no light there, initially. That's where

2874
02:35:51.829 --> 02:35:55.649
"many of the scars of the Calamity still remain."

2875
02:35:55.649 --> 02:35:56.677
MARISHA: Whoa!

2876
02:35:56.677 --> 02:35:58.462
MATT: "The city expands as best as we can,

2877
02:35:58.462 --> 02:35:59.860
"or at least, as best as they can.

2878
02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:01.887
"I have no interest in the expansion, but

2879
02:36:01.887 --> 02:36:04.046
"as more people come to our city, there needs to be room,

2880
02:36:04.046 --> 02:36:08.139
"and there's nowhere else to go but out, so.

2881
02:36:08.139 --> 02:36:11.364
"Brave folks looking for homes

2882
02:36:11.364 --> 02:36:15.150
"fight against the darkness to find their homesteads.

2883
02:36:15.150 --> 02:36:16.854
"Such will is commendable."

2884
02:36:16.854 --> 02:36:19.064
LIAM: Excuse me, what is the best way to reach you

2885
02:36:19.064 --> 02:36:21.937
if we feel the need to?

2886
02:36:21.937 --> 02:36:25.656
MATT: "Well, you've been speaking with your friend

2887
02:36:25.656 --> 02:36:28.843
"with certain means, I think perhaps you have

2888
02:36:28.843 --> 02:36:31.415
"such ways of talking to me should you require my aid."

2889
02:36:31.415 --> 02:36:34.016
LAURA: I can send you a message any time you want.

2890
02:36:34.016 --> 02:36:38.958
MATT: "Good. I look forward to it. Rest well."

2891
02:36:38.958 --> 02:36:41.191
He just turns and exits.

2892
02:36:41.191 --> 02:36:43.515
TRAVIS: Floats away.

2893
02:36:43.515 --> 02:36:45.189
MATT: You can make a perception check.

2894
02:36:45.189 --> 02:36:47.264
LAURA: Swish, swish the cloak.

2895
02:36:47.264 --> 02:36:48.170
SAM: 14 feet.

2896
02:36:48.170 --> 02:36:50.259
TRAVIS: Seven kobolds.

2897
02:36:50.259 --> 02:36:51.710
TALIESIN: He's got a hoverboard.

2898
02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:53.758
TRAVIS: 10.
TALIESIN: He just leans.

2899
02:36:53.758 --> 02:36:54.591
TRAVIS: 14.

2900
02:36:54.591 --> 02:36:56.272
MATT: 14?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2901
02:36:56.272 --> 02:36:57.678
MATT: Yeah, he's not hiding it.

2902
02:36:57.678 --> 02:36:58.800
You can see his footfalls.

2903
02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:00.007
He's not floating through the city,

2904
02:37:00.007 --> 02:37:04.838
but he walks with such a grace

2905
02:37:04.838 --> 02:37:09.036
and a very direct gait that there is no bobbing,

2906
02:37:09.036 --> 02:37:10.094
he just seems to glide.

2907
02:37:10.094 --> 02:37:10.927
TRAVIS: It's that Tomb of the

2908
02:37:10.927 --> 02:37:12.189
Unknown Soldier glide, man, they just.

2909
02:37:12.189 --> 02:37:13.022
MATT: Yeah, straight up.

2910
02:37:13.022 --> 02:37:15.511
LIAM: Fosse.

2911
02:37:15.511 --> 02:37:17.824
TALIESIN: It's a-- what are they called?

2912
02:37:17.824 --> 02:37:21.303
LIAM: Oh, he's on a Segway.
TALIESIN: He's on a Segway.

2913
02:37:21.303 --> 02:37:23.717
MATT: That's why he keeps the cloak around it.

2914
02:37:23.717 --> 02:37:27.675
LIAM: "Well, I'll leave you now." (whooshing)

2915
02:37:27.675 --> 02:37:30.277
MATT: Hey, man.

2916
02:37:30.277 --> 02:37:33.743
Enchantments get weird when money's involved.

2917
02:37:33.743 --> 02:37:37.322
SAM: Can I just say, walking through the city to get here:

2918
02:37:37.322 --> 02:37:39.337
what a fucking great DM we have.

2919
02:37:39.337 --> 02:37:41.702
I mean, come on. Amazing.

2920
02:37:41.702 --> 02:37:43.631
TALIESIN: Your character will be the next to die.

2921
02:37:43.631 --> 02:37:45.389
MATT: Yeah.

2922
02:37:46.359 --> 02:37:51.342
Yeza's still holding your hand and

2923
02:37:51.342 --> 02:37:53.679
looks over towards you.

2924
02:37:53.679 --> 02:37:57.764
"Can we get somewhere to eat?"

2925
02:37:57.764 --> 02:37:59.580
TALIESIN: Food and how many rooms?

2926
02:37:59.580 --> 02:38:01.422
TRAVIS: Well, we have some shirts in the Bag of Holding

2927
02:38:01.422 --> 02:38:04.929
if we wanted to keep up the diet. No?

2928
02:38:04.929 --> 02:38:07.053
TALIESIN: Let's get a proper meal.

2929
02:38:07.053 --> 02:38:08.737
How many rooms did we get, out of curiosity?

2930
02:38:08.737 --> 02:38:11.311
MATT: "Well, how many do you need, actually,

2931
02:38:11.311 --> 02:38:12.486
"is my question for you.

2932
02:38:12.486 --> 02:38:17.200
"What are your names, I need to put something down.

2933
02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:18.033
"A name, something."

2934
02:38:18.033 --> 02:38:20.099
TRAVIS: I'm Fjord.

2935
02:38:20.099 --> 02:38:22.033
MATT: "Fjord, all right, the party of Fjord."

2936
02:38:22.033 --> 02:38:23.233
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yep.

2937
02:38:23.233 --> 02:38:26.075
MATT: "I will be ensuring payments come

2938
02:38:26.075 --> 02:38:28.263
"and are noted as such.

2939
02:38:28.263 --> 02:38:31.058
"All right, how many rooms do you require?"

2940
02:38:31.058 --> 02:38:34.016
TALIESIN: Three would be--
SAM: Four.

2941
02:38:34.016 --> 02:38:35.341
MATT: "Four rooms, very well."

2942
02:38:35.341 --> 02:38:37.382
LAURA: They definitely need one with

2943
02:38:37.382 --> 02:38:39.265
a heart-shaped bed and stuff.

2944
02:38:39.265 --> 02:38:40.791
TRAVIS: Like a corner suite.

2945
02:38:40.791 --> 02:38:42.608
LAURA: There's going to be lots of stuff happening in there.

2946
02:38:42.608 --> 02:38:44.358
TRAVIS: Hope your walls are made of concrete.

2947
02:38:46.007 --> 02:38:47.540
MATT: "Delightful. Food?"

2948
02:38:47.540 --> 02:38:49.390
LAURA: Should probably, oh, wait.

2949
02:38:49.390 --> 02:38:52.670
Would you want to take a bath, though?

2950
02:38:52.670 --> 02:38:53.820
SAM: He would.

2951
02:38:53.820 --> 02:38:55.228
LAURA: But would you, though?

2952
02:38:55.228 --> 02:38:56.111
SAM: He would.

2953
02:38:56.111 --> 02:38:59.552
TRAVIS: A bucket of ice. Some ibuprofen.

2954
02:38:59.552 --> 02:39:01.102
MATT: "Well, I will be happy

2955
02:39:01.102 --> 02:39:06.102
"to do this. The deal did not mention covering meals,

2956
02:39:06.570 --> 02:39:08.714
"so those you'd have to pay for, unfortunately."

2957
02:39:08.714 --> 02:39:09.647
SAM: Like a cruise?

2958
02:39:09.647 --> 02:39:12.297
TRAVIS: Boy, I would hate to hear the Bright Queen was upset

2959
02:39:12.297 --> 02:39:14.068
to hear that her special guests

2960
02:39:14.068 --> 02:39:17.352
were not treated to every luxury you have.

2961
02:39:17.352 --> 02:39:20.927
(laughter)

2962
02:39:20.927 --> 02:39:22.322
LIAM: I believe the words--

2963
02:39:22.322 --> 02:39:24.952
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2964
02:39:24.952 --> 02:39:27.563
LIAM: Hold on, Fjord, I believe the word she used was

2965
02:39:27.563 --> 02:39:29.839
"Heroes of the Dynasty."

2966
02:39:29.839 --> 02:39:32.081
TRAVIS: You heard it.

2967
02:39:32.081 --> 02:39:33.841
23.

2968
02:39:33.841 --> 02:39:37.241
MATT: He goes, "Oh, well,

2969
02:39:37.241 --> 02:39:39.391
"we could comp you

2970
02:39:39.391 --> 02:39:41.286
"a simple meal and

2971
02:39:41.286 --> 02:39:43.953
"maybe a bottle of wine.

2972
02:39:43.953 --> 02:39:45.590
"Wonderful.

2973
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:48.804
"Four rooms, four rooms, all right.

2974
02:39:48.804 --> 02:39:50.014
"We'll arrange that for you now."

2975
02:39:50.014 --> 02:39:53.239
Passes out keys to you guys.

2976
02:39:53.239 --> 02:39:56.238
Meals are provided, a fine meal

2977
02:39:56.238 --> 02:40:00.455
of very unique meat.

2978
02:40:00.455 --> 02:40:05.452
It looks tough, but like a very well-cooked venison,

2979
02:40:05.452 --> 02:40:08.028
it just falls apart in the mouth.

2980
02:40:08.028 --> 02:40:09.686
TALIESIN: I'll have a side salad.

2981
02:40:09.686 --> 02:40:11.856
MATT: There you go.

2982
02:40:11.856 --> 02:40:13.232
TALIESIN: Everybody has side salad.

2983
02:40:13.232 --> 02:40:15.723
TRAVIS: Excellent iceberg lettuce.

2984
02:40:15.723 --> 02:40:17.519
MATT: Another interesting thing of note.

2985
02:40:17.519 --> 02:40:20.188
In this tavern, if you request,

2986
02:40:20.188 --> 02:40:22.230
well, the food that's given to you

2987
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:24.055
and based on your persuasion check,

2988
02:40:24.055 --> 02:40:25.595
you notice the meals that are being passed around

2989
02:40:25.595 --> 02:40:28.148
to folks here are generally bland,

2990
02:40:28.148 --> 02:40:31.770
both in color and texture.

2991
02:40:31.770 --> 02:40:33.209
The meals you get are very nice

2992
02:40:33.209 --> 02:40:38.209
and for all the vegetation and the quality of produce

2993
02:40:38.227 --> 02:40:41.794
that you've come across since arriving in Xhorhas,

2994
02:40:41.794 --> 02:40:46.152
there are actual fine vegetables.

2995
02:40:47.672 --> 02:40:50.282
Carrots, lettuce, cauliflower,

2996
02:40:50.282 --> 02:40:51.867
like all these things that you have not seen

2997
02:40:51.867 --> 02:40:55.206
since you came here that are well-kept and fresh.

2998
02:40:55.206 --> 02:40:56.386
TALIESIN: Interesting.

2999
02:40:56.386 --> 02:40:57.219
LIAM: Lettuce.

3000
02:40:57.219 --> 02:41:00.160
LAURA: Lettuce, cauliflower.

3001
02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:04.192
MATT: Your meals are presented,

3002
02:41:04.192 --> 02:41:07.350
Yeza scarfs himself to the near point

3003
02:41:07.350 --> 02:41:12.350
of getting sick, but seems to be making up for

3004
02:41:12.359 --> 02:41:15.139
quite some time without a fine meal.

3005
02:41:15.139 --> 02:41:17.362
MARISHA: Anyone paying attention to us?

3006
02:41:17.362 --> 02:41:20.416
MATT: Everyone in the room is paying attention to you guys.

3007
02:41:20.416 --> 02:41:21.633
They're all talking amongst themselves,

3008
02:41:21.633 --> 02:41:22.880
but every time you glance around to look,

3009
02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:25.344
there's always some people avert their gaze

3010
02:41:25.344 --> 02:41:26.449
and go back to their conversation,

3011
02:41:26.449 --> 02:41:28.140
trying to play it off like they weren't paying attention,

3012
02:41:28.140 --> 02:41:33.140
but you're definitely not the usuals

3013
02:41:33.539 --> 02:41:35.665
here in the Dim's Inn.

3014
02:41:35.665 --> 02:41:38.225
LIAM: Yeah, out of curiosity, on that entire walk,

3015
02:41:38.225 --> 02:41:40.819
well, I'm not going to say sure, but we probably

3016
02:41:40.819 --> 02:41:45.819
didn't see any humans, did we see a tiefling, a half-orc?

3017
02:41:46.335 --> 02:41:51.083
MATT: You did see, nowhere near as numerous,

3018
02:41:51.083 --> 02:41:53.702
you crossed a few orcs and half-orcs,

3019
02:41:53.702 --> 02:41:58.519
you saw in here, in the the Gallimaufry.

3020
02:41:59.875 --> 02:42:04.875
You managed to see maybe three tieflings at a distance,

3021
02:42:05.323 --> 02:42:08.181
all red-skinned

3022
02:42:08.181 --> 02:42:12.768
and they seem to be part of the general populace.

3023
02:42:12.768 --> 02:42:17.483
Humans, you haven't come across one yet.

3024
02:42:17.483 --> 02:42:21.160
If you recall from Yasha saying where she came from

3025
02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:24.533
and about her upbringing, most of them didn't have interest

3026
02:42:24.533 --> 02:42:28.420
going this far north of Xhorhas.

3027
02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:30.858
So far, you have not seen any.

3028
02:42:30.858 --> 02:42:34.136
You definitely strike a unique,

3029
02:42:34.136 --> 02:42:37.049
as a troop, you're colorful.

3030
02:42:37.049 --> 02:42:40.282
As a troop with two humans

3031
02:42:40.282 --> 02:42:45.282
and three human-looking figures,

3032
02:42:45.573 --> 02:42:47.944
definitely catching some attention.

3033
02:42:47.944 --> 02:42:51.399
MARISHA: Is anyone noteworthy looking?

3034
02:42:51.399 --> 02:42:56.263
Anyone that's not the average worker type?

3035
02:42:56.263 --> 02:42:58.227
TRAVIS: Is anyone aiming a crossbow at us?

3036
02:42:58.227 --> 02:43:00.059
LIAM: Is there anybody I could punch out?

3037
02:43:00.059 --> 02:43:02.489
MATT: The drunk ogre that's in the middle of the card game

3038
02:43:02.489 --> 02:43:05.041
is being less boisterous and looking at his cards

3039
02:43:05.041 --> 02:43:09.891
and then glancing up and kind of (snorting).

3040
02:43:13.564 --> 02:43:15.946
The whole room is paying attention to you guys.

3041
02:43:15.946 --> 02:43:19.327
You feel like the crawling of warmth

3042
02:43:19.327 --> 02:43:21.729
at the back of your neck of unwanting

3043
02:43:21.729 --> 02:43:24.308
to be the center of attention but no way to escape it.

3044
02:43:24.308 --> 02:43:27.069
Nevertheless, your meal is fine

3045
02:43:27.069 --> 02:43:28.570
and that doesn't go unnoticed either

3046
02:43:28.570 --> 02:43:30.355
from the rest of the patrons.

3047
02:43:30.355 --> 02:43:33.780
The scale of dinner you've been provided

3048
02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:35.629
and are enjoying definitely,

3049
02:43:35.629 --> 02:43:40.263
there is a disparate difference.

3050
02:43:40.263 --> 02:43:42.179
TRAVIS: Can I get up and head over to the barkeep real quick

3051
02:43:42.179 --> 02:43:46.362
and say: Hey, quick question.

3052
02:43:46.362 --> 02:43:50.541
They mentioned a Ghostlands in the Corona District?

3053
02:43:50.541 --> 02:43:51.957
MATT: Going to the barkeep

3054
02:43:51.957 --> 02:43:53.193
or are you going to the tavern owner?

3055
02:43:53.193 --> 02:43:56.105
TRAVIS: The tavern-- no, the barkeep.

3056
02:43:56.105 --> 02:43:58.027
MATT: Okay, the barkeep you go up to,

3057
02:43:58.027 --> 02:44:01.114
this is another drow,

3058
02:44:01.114 --> 02:44:05.224
this one's older, a little portlier,

3059
02:44:05.224 --> 02:44:06.731
has a heavy scar that goes

3060
02:44:06.731 --> 02:44:10.086
from the ear to the side of the mouth,

3061
02:44:10.086 --> 02:44:11.453
and looks a little more rough and tumble

3062
02:44:11.453 --> 02:44:14.189
than some of the more noble figures

3063
02:44:14.189 --> 02:44:17.146
that you've been rubbing shoulders with since you came.

3064
02:44:17.146 --> 02:44:21.219
Glances up to you. You can see his receding widow's peak

3065
02:44:21.219 --> 02:44:23.268
and hair that's tucked past the ears

3066
02:44:23.268 --> 02:44:25.765
that falls just past the shoulders.

3067
02:44:25.765 --> 02:44:29.526
The chin has a heavy cleft in the middle there.

3068
02:44:29.526 --> 02:44:31.313
Looks up to you.

3069
02:44:31.313 --> 02:44:32.891
"Right, can I help you?"

3070
02:44:32.891 --> 02:44:35.008
TRAVIS: Nice place you have here.

3071
02:44:35.008 --> 02:44:38.075
Thank you for taking care of us while we're here.

3072
02:44:38.075 --> 02:44:41.040
We heard of a place called the Ghostlands

3073
02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:42.812
out by the Corona District.

3074
02:44:42.812 --> 02:44:45.955
We're new, obviously.

3075
02:44:45.955 --> 02:44:47.821
MATT: "Gathered as much.

3076
02:44:47.821 --> 02:44:51.301
"The Ghostlands, that is beyond the city.

3077
02:44:51.301 --> 02:44:53.271
"Why do you want to know?"
TRAVIS: Just want to make sure

3078
02:44:53.271 --> 02:44:55.563
it's real far away.

3079
02:44:55.563 --> 02:44:58.396
MATT: "I mean, it's maybe an hour-and-a-half walk."

3080
02:44:58.396 --> 02:45:00.228
TRAVIS: That sounds great.

3081
02:45:00.228 --> 02:45:02.384
People head out there often,

3082
02:45:02.384 --> 02:45:05.363
the brave looking for place to settle down, we heard?

3083
02:45:05.363 --> 02:45:06.879
MATT: "Or the stupid, yeah."

3084
02:45:06.879 --> 02:45:09.287
TRAVIS: They're stupid.

3085
02:45:10.841 --> 02:45:15.298
MATT: "The laws, as they are, if you don't have land here,

3086
02:45:15.298 --> 02:45:17.023
"you can take it."

3087
02:45:17.023 --> 02:45:18.675
TRAVIS: Out there?

3088
02:45:18.675 --> 02:45:22.993
MATT: "If you want to set up a home and you want to,

3089
02:45:22.993 --> 02:45:27.626
"essentially, squat and it becomes yours.

3090
02:45:27.626 --> 02:45:30.438
"The downside, you live in the Ghostlands.

3091
02:45:30.438 --> 02:45:33.446
"They've only extended the outer wall once,

3092
02:45:33.446 --> 02:45:36.562
"that was 80 years ago."

3093
02:45:36.562 --> 02:45:40.828
TRAVIS: A lot of people come back from the Ghostlands?

3094
02:45:40.828 --> 02:45:43.070
MATT: "Most of them.

3095
02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:46.528
"Meaning those who return, most of them have come back."

3096
02:45:46.528 --> 02:45:48.183
TRAVIS: Right.

3097
02:45:48.183 --> 02:45:52.277
Great, that was all, thank you.

3098
02:45:52.277 --> 02:45:55.536
We are not going out by the Corona District

3099
02:45:55.536 --> 02:45:57.185
unless we absolutely have to.

3100
02:45:57.185 --> 02:45:59.927
He said everybody who goes out there dies.

3101
02:45:59.927 --> 02:46:01.520
MARISHA: Mm, okay.

3102
02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:03.528
TRAVIS: I mean, it's called the Ghostlands.

3103
02:46:03.528 --> 02:46:04.611
I don't want to be a ghost.

3104
02:46:04.611 --> 02:46:06.074
LAURA: I didn't want to go out there anyway, Fjord.

3105
02:46:06.074 --> 02:46:06.907
SAM: They said not to go there.

3106
02:46:06.907 --> 02:46:08.582
LAURA: Why would we want to go out there?

3107
02:46:08.582 --> 02:46:09.906
TRAVIS: I just figured everybody's

3108
02:46:09.906 --> 02:46:11.115
natural curiosity was piqued.

3109
02:46:11.115 --> 02:46:12.880
TALIESIN: No, not really.

3110
02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:16.137
LIAM: On that note, maybe we should mull over this evening

3111
02:46:16.137 --> 02:46:19.836
what it is we want to do and perhaps retire

3112
02:46:19.836 --> 02:46:23.740
all of us to one of our rooms to discuss some things.

3113
02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:25.431
TRAVIS: Yes.

3114
02:46:25.431 --> 02:46:27.230
LIAM: Instead of improvising, which we're good at,

3115
02:46:27.230 --> 02:46:30.554
but doesn't always lead to the best results, not always.

3116
02:46:30.554 --> 02:46:31.970
TRAVIS: Everybody get enough to eat?

3117
02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:35.033
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to shove a bunch of stuff in my bag.

3118
02:46:35.033 --> 02:46:36.832
TRAVIS: Even though it's nighttime out.

3119
02:46:36.832 --> 02:46:39.082
LAURA: Do you guys have dessert?

3120
02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:42.206
MATT: You saying this to the tavern owner?

3121
02:46:42.206 --> 02:46:43.516
LAURA: Uh-huh.

3122
02:46:43.516 --> 02:46:46.848
MATT: "There is dessert if dessert is what you would like.

3123
02:46:46.848 --> 02:46:47.991
"What kind of dessert would you like?"

3124
02:46:47.991 --> 02:46:48.886
LAURA: What do you have?

3125
02:46:48.886 --> 02:46:53.886
MATT: "We have puddings, we have pastries, we have fruits."

3126
02:46:54.439 --> 02:46:56.139
TALIESIN: What's local?

3127
02:46:56.139 --> 02:46:58.888
LAURA: What's local?
LIAM: Local specialty.

3128
02:46:58.888 --> 02:47:01.379
LAURA: Also the pastries, though, as well.

3129
02:47:01.379 --> 02:47:02.212
MATT: "All right, pastries can be done.

3130
02:47:02.212 --> 02:47:05.701
"Local specialty, I'll be right back."

3131
02:47:05.701 --> 02:47:06.634
He leaves for a bit.

3132
02:47:06.634 --> 02:47:08.255
TALIESIN: Always want to eat local.

3133
02:47:08.255 --> 02:47:12.310
MATT: Comes back with three small bowls on little platters,

3134
02:47:12.310 --> 02:47:15.133
set them down with a series of spoons against them

3135
02:47:15.133 --> 02:47:19.804
and each of them, it looks to be like a parfait.

3136
02:47:19.804 --> 02:47:23.721
The fruit is a very watery, like a--

3137
02:47:27.683 --> 02:47:29.183
MARISHA: Lychee?
SAM: Mousse?

3138
02:47:30.678 --> 02:47:31.769
MATT: I was thinking about the fruit

3139
02:47:31.769 --> 02:47:32.602
that always comes in fruit bowls

3140
02:47:32.602 --> 02:47:34.003
that nobody eats because it's the worst.

3141
02:47:34.003 --> 02:47:35.532
TRAVIS: Acai?
SAM: Durian?

3142
02:47:35.532 --> 02:47:36.853
MATT: No, the other lope.

3143
02:47:36.853 --> 02:47:38.571
TRAVIS: Cantaloupe?
LAURA: Melon, no.

3144
02:47:38.571 --> 02:47:40.884
MARISHA: Honeydew.
MATT: Honeydew, thank you.

3145
02:47:40.884 --> 02:47:43.282
Apologies to those who love honeydew; it drives me nuts.

3146
02:47:43.282 --> 02:47:46.232
LIAM: In a shitty fruit bowl it sucks,

3147
02:47:46.232 --> 02:47:48.148
but if you cut open a honeydew right there,

3148
02:47:48.148 --> 02:47:49.971
it's delicious.
MATT: Right, and that's fine.

3149
02:47:49.971 --> 02:47:52.152
TRAVIS: 80% honeydew, maybe some pineapple.

3150
02:47:52.152 --> 02:47:55.733
MARISHA: It is like the packing peanuts of fruit, though.

3151
02:47:55.733 --> 02:47:57.545
MATT: Anyway, it looks like honeydew.

3152
02:47:57.545 --> 02:48:00.301
It's a very watery, melon-like substance

3153
02:48:00.301 --> 02:48:01.471
that's on the edges of it,

3154
02:48:01.471 --> 02:48:02.587
you can see the light come through.

3155
02:48:02.587 --> 02:48:05.642
It looks very soft and beneath that,

3156
02:48:05.642 --> 02:48:08.673
there is a a cream pudding type,

3157
02:48:08.673 --> 02:48:13.384
but it's a dull, like a tan coloration to it.

3158
02:48:13.384 --> 02:48:16.129
It does not look appetizing compared to

3159
02:48:16.129 --> 02:48:18.787
the glorious, colorful sweets and treats

3160
02:48:18.787 --> 02:48:20.110
that you're used to. The Menagerie Coast

3161
02:48:20.110 --> 02:48:22.176
is largely known for its decadent desserts

3162
02:48:22.176 --> 02:48:24.974
and this is a little disappointing to be the local special.

3163
02:48:24.974 --> 02:48:25.880
TALIESIN: It's weird and bland.

3164
02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:27.157
I'm into it, I'm going to take a bite.

3165
02:48:27.157 --> 02:48:28.595
MATT: Okay.

3166
02:48:28.595 --> 02:48:30.907
It's surprisingly tasty.

3167
02:48:30.907 --> 02:48:33.445
It doesn't blow your mind by any means,

3168
02:48:33.445 --> 02:48:35.963
but it is sweet, it has some unique textures.

3169
02:48:35.963 --> 02:48:38.798
The melon tends to burst in your mouth,

3170
02:48:38.798 --> 02:48:43.789
similar to those little mochi balls, whatever it is.

3171
02:48:43.789 --> 02:48:44.839
TALIESIN: I love those.

3172
02:48:44.839 --> 02:48:46.689
I know the ones you're talking about, yeah.

3173
02:48:46.689 --> 02:48:47.980
MATT: Like a Gusher.

3174
02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:51.518
LIAM: What food would blow Caduceus' mind?

3175
02:48:51.518 --> 02:48:53.159
TALIESIN: The impossible burger.

3176
02:48:53.159 --> 02:48:56.084
(laughter)

3177
02:48:58.242 --> 02:48:59.574
MATT: It's not bad.

3178
02:48:59.574 --> 02:49:00.407
TALIESIN: That was interesting.

3179
02:49:00.407 --> 02:49:01.673
LAURA: Where's the whipped cream and stuff,

3180
02:49:01.673 --> 02:49:02.739
though, for it and stuff?

3181
02:49:02.739 --> 02:49:03.894
MATT: He's already walked away.

3182
02:49:03.894 --> 02:49:05.348
LAURA: (groans)

3183
02:49:05.348 --> 02:49:07.014
MATT: He literally dropped and left.

3184
02:49:07.014 --> 02:49:08.281
He's like, "Here you go, bye!"

3185
02:49:08.281 --> 02:49:12.567
LAURA: He brought a plate of pastries, though, too, right?

3186
02:49:12.567 --> 02:49:15.362
MATT: He comes back with pastries thereafter.

3187
02:49:15.362 --> 02:49:16.695
They look like standard pastries.

3188
02:49:16.695 --> 02:49:18.249
LAURA: Sweet, I put them all in my bag.

3189
02:49:18.249 --> 02:49:21.277
MATT: Okay, you load up on Xhorhasian pastries.

3190
02:49:21.277 --> 02:49:23.311
LAURA: Yeah, then I'll eat the fruit bowl thingy.

3191
02:49:23.311 --> 02:49:25.228
TALIESIN: Carb loading.

3192
02:49:26.405 --> 02:49:28.428
MATT: Yeza grabs one off the thing and

3193
02:49:28.428 --> 02:49:31.419
you can see he's full to the point of being sick

3194
02:49:31.419 --> 02:49:34.768
and he's like, "(groans), I may have had too much."

3195
02:49:34.768 --> 02:49:36.192
LAURA: Don't fill yourself up too much.

3196
02:49:36.192 --> 02:49:37.195
MATT: He grabs one anyway.

3197
02:49:37.195 --> 02:49:39.109
LAURA: You have a lot of boning ahead of you.

3198
02:49:39.109 --> 02:49:39.942
MATT: "What?"

3199
02:49:39.942 --> 02:49:43.953
SAM: No, he's fine. Just let him recuperate, it's all right.

3200
02:49:43.953 --> 02:49:45.705
We may not get to that tonight.

3201
02:49:45.705 --> 02:49:48.347
TRAVIS: Yeza, if you need to use our room

3202
02:49:48.347 --> 02:49:50.417
with facilities later, you just come knock,

3203
02:49:50.417 --> 02:49:51.571
we'll let you in.

3204
02:49:51.571 --> 02:49:53.225
MATT: "Okay."

3205
02:49:53.225 --> 02:49:55.317
SAM: We're cool, we poop in front of each other.

3206
02:49:55.317 --> 02:49:57.808
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

3207
02:49:57.808 --> 02:49:59.362
MATT: Now that's he finished eating,

3208
02:49:59.362 --> 02:50:03.050
you can see Yeza now starting to look around the vicinity

3209
02:50:03.050 --> 02:50:05.963
and see the eyes upon him because

3210
02:50:05.963 --> 02:50:08.507
you've rarely seen humans in Xhorhas,

3211
02:50:08.507 --> 02:50:11.877
you've definitely not seen any halflings.

3212
02:50:11.877 --> 02:50:16.794
Yeza's now looking over the table of the people around.

3213
02:50:18.298 --> 02:50:21.195
"Veth, there's, there's a lot of people looking at me."

3214
02:50:21.195 --> 02:50:24.816
SAM: Yeah, welcome to my world.

3215
02:50:24.816 --> 02:50:29.205
It takes some getting used to being the odd person out

3216
02:50:29.205 --> 02:50:32.159
at a place like this, but just look at me.

3217
02:50:32.159 --> 02:50:33.859
Well, no.

3218
02:50:33.859 --> 02:50:38.600
Just look at your food and think about good things

3219
02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:40.589
and don't worry about them.

3220
02:50:40.589 --> 02:50:43.902
We're stronger than them, these friends around us can

3221
02:50:43.902 --> 02:50:46.752
defend us from anything.

3222
02:50:46.752 --> 02:50:49.472
MATT: "What can you guys do?"

3223
02:50:49.472 --> 02:50:51.309
SAM: Oh, they have all sorts of tricks.

3224
02:50:51.309 --> 02:50:53.787
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows.

3225
02:50:53.787 --> 02:50:54.813
MATT: (crashing)

3226
02:50:54.813 --> 02:50:57.163
All the doors, all the windows slam open.

3227
02:50:57.163 --> 02:51:00.420
Wind whooshes through.

3228
02:51:00.420 --> 02:51:04.734
Some of the lanterns flicker, die out.

3229
02:51:04.734 --> 02:51:06.525
Everyone in the room goes like (gasping).

3230
02:51:06.525 --> 02:51:08.325
LAURA: Yeah!

3231
02:51:08.325 --> 02:51:10.031
TALIESIN: I'm going to close them all.

3232
02:51:10.031 --> 02:51:12.358
MATT: (crashing) They all close rapidly.

3233
02:51:12.358 --> 02:51:15.114
The lanterns, one of them glows back up more,

3234
02:51:15.114 --> 02:51:16.399
the other one's completely out.

3235
02:51:16.399 --> 02:51:18.053
TALIESIN: Come on, there, yeah, there we go.

3236
02:51:18.053 --> 02:51:21.227
LAURA: Then everyone, there's this awkward pause afterward,

3237
02:51:21.227 --> 02:51:23.216
and they're all looking at Jester

3238
02:51:23.216 --> 02:51:24.587
and then looking at Caduceus.

3239
02:51:24.587 --> 02:51:26.819
TALIESIN: Sorry, sorry.

3240
02:51:26.819 --> 02:51:28.618
MATT: Go back and turn their backs to the table

3241
02:51:28.618 --> 02:51:29.876
and pretend like nothing happened.

3242
02:51:29.876 --> 02:51:32.276
LIAM: Heroes of the Empire, heroes.

3243
02:51:33.601 --> 02:51:36.251
MARISHA: Okay, let's not, let's not.

3244
02:51:36.251 --> 02:51:37.808
LAURA: We're not Heroes of the Empire;

3245
02:51:37.808 --> 02:51:39.991
we're Heroes of the Dynasty.

3246
02:51:39.991 --> 02:51:41.932
Don't want to be Heroes of the Empire here.

3247
02:51:41.932 --> 02:51:42.898
LIAM: Both, it's both.

3248
02:51:42.898 --> 02:51:45.213
SAM: Well!

3249
02:51:45.213 --> 02:51:47.901
They're pretty strong, they'll take care of us.

3250
02:51:47.901 --> 02:51:49.679
They've taken care of me this whole time.

3251
02:51:49.679 --> 02:51:50.964
MATT: "Okay."

3252
02:51:50.964 --> 02:51:54.392
LIAM: What Veth says is true,

3253
02:51:54.392 --> 02:51:58.754
but you would be surprised at what your wife can do now.

3254
02:51:58.754 --> 02:52:02.854
MATT: "Well, she's always surprised with what she can do."

3255
02:52:02.854 --> 02:52:06.979
SAM: It's been a long road to get here and

3256
02:52:06.979 --> 02:52:10.420
I've learned a couple tricks from my friends.

3257
02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:12.978
MATT: "She's a very good assistant."

3258
02:52:12.978 --> 02:52:15.055
MARISHA: Assistant?
SAM: Yeah, no, he's right.

3259
02:52:15.055 --> 02:52:16.391
LIAM: She's quick.

3260
02:52:16.391 --> 02:52:19.339
MATT: "Yeah, no, she picks things up very fast."

3261
02:52:19.339 --> 02:52:23.064
LIAM: That is true, sorry.

3262
02:52:24.352 --> 02:52:25.227
TALIESIN: Wow.

3263
02:52:27.152 --> 02:52:28.716
TRAVIS: Perhaps we should retire upstairs

3264
02:52:28.716 --> 02:52:33.195
where we can speak a little bit more.

3265
02:52:33.195 --> 02:52:35.131
I'll step back from the table and walk

3266
02:52:35.131 --> 02:52:38.048
like I know where the stairs are.

3267
02:52:38.048 --> 02:52:39.298
MATT: Takes you a moment,

3268
02:52:39.298 --> 02:52:41.206
but you eventually find the stairs.

3269
02:52:41.206 --> 02:52:44.055
Only half loop, it wasn't too embarrassing.

3270
02:52:44.055 --> 02:52:45.466
You guys follow suit?

3271
02:52:45.466 --> 02:52:47.940
LIAM: Yeah, we're all going.

3272
02:52:47.940 --> 02:52:50.981
LAURA: -- that they get to their room okay, you know,

3273
02:52:50.981 --> 02:52:52.097
because the halfling and everything.

3274
02:52:52.097 --> 02:52:53.763
SAM: Are we all going to go to the same room?

3275
02:52:53.763 --> 02:52:54.596
TRAVIS: All in the same room.

3276
02:52:54.596 --> 02:52:56.004
LIAM: We need to discuss.

3277
02:52:56.004 --> 02:52:56.841
MATT: Okay.

3278
02:52:56.841 --> 02:53:00.316
You all make your way, Yasha forming the rear.

3279
02:53:00.316 --> 02:53:04.017
As you set up, Yasha turns to the rest of the room

3280
02:53:04.017 --> 02:53:05.364
and you watch this dark shadow

3281
02:53:05.364 --> 02:53:07.855
begin to build off of her shoulders

3282
02:53:07.855 --> 02:53:10.088
and she goes (huffs).

3283
02:53:10.088 --> 02:53:13.379
One of the nearby drow goes--

3284
02:53:13.379 --> 02:53:17.756
She turns around and follows you back up the steps.

3285
02:53:17.756 --> 02:53:19.584
You find your rooms as they were described to you.

3286
02:53:19.584 --> 02:53:22.166
There are four of them, but there's a space,

3287
02:53:22.166 --> 02:53:23.810
there's three and there's another room

3288
02:53:23.810 --> 02:53:28.810
and then the fourth, final one, as requested, a corner room.

3289
02:53:29.443 --> 02:53:31.907
So yes, you can enter one of those rooms easy enough

3290
02:53:31.907 --> 02:53:33.500
and it's a little cramped.

3291
02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:37.452
It isn't a lot of space for eight people,

3292
02:53:37.452 --> 02:53:40.071
though two smaller of the group,

3293
02:53:40.071 --> 02:53:42.420
but you have a room, the door is closed.

3294
02:53:42.420 --> 02:53:45.913
It's decently furnished for a standard inn.

3295
02:53:45.913 --> 02:53:47.271
It's better than what you're used to

3296
02:53:47.271 --> 02:53:51.252
in Felderwin, of course, but

3297
02:53:51.252 --> 02:53:55.714
the establishment isn't quite top end.

3298
02:53:55.714 --> 02:53:59.532
In Zadash, it's no Pillow Trove, if you will,

3299
02:53:59.532 --> 02:54:02.199
but it's nice, it's not too bad.

3300
02:54:04.164 --> 02:54:08.405
LIAM: Caduceus, you are the tallest of the group,

3301
02:54:08.405 --> 02:54:11.344
maybe you would because we have an extra room,

3302
02:54:11.344 --> 02:54:13.381
maybe you'd take one for yourself.

3303
02:54:13.381 --> 02:54:14.886
TALIESIN: I can do that.

3304
02:54:14.886 --> 02:54:16.940
LAURA: I though that they were going to take the room.

3305
02:54:16.940 --> 02:54:18.825
LIAM: There's four rooms, so--

3306
02:54:18.825 --> 02:54:23.746
One, two, three, four.

3307
02:54:23.746 --> 02:54:26.932
I'll share with Yasha since we're both tall.

3308
02:54:26.932 --> 02:54:27.765
Or, yeah.

3309
02:54:29.764 --> 02:54:32.811
Yeah, that works fine for me.

3310
02:54:32.811 --> 02:54:34.854
MARISHA: Okay, do people, do we want to drop our shit

3311
02:54:34.854 --> 02:54:38.024
and meet in your guys' room in like five?

3312
02:54:38.024 --> 02:54:38.916
TALIESIN: That'll do.

3313
02:54:38.916 --> 02:54:40.127
MARISHA: Team meeting in five?

3314
02:54:40.127 --> 02:54:41.207
TRAVIS: Yep.

3315
02:54:41.207 --> 02:54:43.895
LAURA: Does that give you guys enough time?

3316
02:54:43.895 --> 02:54:48.588
SAM: Jes, we can wait a few more minutes.

3317
02:54:48.588 --> 02:54:50.220
TRAVIS: You need a few more minutes, ten minutes?

3318
02:54:50.220 --> 02:54:52.811
SAM: No, no, five's fine, we're fine, don't worry.

3319
02:54:52.811 --> 02:54:54.857
TRAVIS: Wow, that is efficient.

3320
02:54:54.857 --> 02:54:56.690
LAURA: I mean, it's really up to Yeza,

3321
02:54:56.690 --> 02:54:59.128
it's not fully your decision yet.

3322
02:54:59.128 --> 02:55:02.632
I mean, it's both of your decision, it's not--

3323
02:55:02.632 --> 02:55:05.604
MARISHA: I'm going to go pick a room and start this process.

3324
02:55:05.604 --> 02:55:08.531
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb, I hate to be suspicious

3325
02:55:08.531 --> 02:55:12.614
of our new situation, I'm not inclined to be, but

3326
02:55:14.854 --> 02:55:19.529
if I were to want to keep tabs on people,

3327
02:55:19.529 --> 02:55:23.944
this is how I'd do it. And I'm showing him the badge.

3328
02:55:25.299 --> 02:55:27.590
I don't know if we have a way of--

3329
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:30.328
SAM: Putting all of those badges in a box?

3330
02:55:30.328 --> 02:55:32.003
TALIESIN: For the moment.

3331
02:55:32.003 --> 02:55:33.490
TRAVIS: Or a bag.

3332
02:55:33.490 --> 02:55:35.926
TALIESIN: Or a box, we have a box.

3333
02:55:35.926 --> 02:55:37.115
MATT: You <i>had</i> a box.

3334
02:55:37.115 --> 02:55:38.343
TALIESIN: Oh and the box went with the--

3335
02:55:38.343 --> 02:55:40.564
MATT: The box went with the device that you found.

3336
02:55:40.564 --> 02:55:42.337
LAURA: Aw, I liked that lead box.

3337
02:55:42.337 --> 02:55:44.587
TALIESIN: Put it in the bag

3338
02:55:44.587 --> 02:55:47.910
for any sense of conversation for now.

3339
02:55:47.910 --> 02:55:49.694
LIAM: We went to so much trouble to get that box.

3340
02:55:49.694 --> 02:55:51.297
LAURA: I know.
TALIESIN: It was a nice box.

3341
02:55:51.297 --> 02:55:54.622
MARISHA: We'll get a new box.

3342
02:55:54.622 --> 02:55:57.357
LAURA: Pick the best room for us.

3343
02:55:57.357 --> 02:55:59.645
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

3344
02:55:59.645 --> 02:56:00.788
LAURA: Yeah, we run out of the room.

3345
02:56:00.788 --> 02:56:03.163
MARISHA: I open all the doors, look at them all,

3346
02:56:03.163 --> 02:56:06.193
compare which one has the best sheets and the most pillows.

3347
02:56:06.193 --> 02:56:07.259
Does one have a rug?

3348
02:56:07.259 --> 02:56:08.098
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3349
02:56:08.098 --> 02:56:09.913
MARISHA: Which one looks like the best one?

3350
02:56:09.913 --> 02:56:11.361
Is there a newer mattress?

3351
02:56:11.361 --> 02:56:13.331
MATT: You're going up and testing the springiness

3352
02:56:13.331 --> 02:56:15.103
and the thread count of the sheets.

3353
02:56:15.103 --> 02:56:16.763
MARISHA: Right, 16.

3354
02:56:16.763 --> 02:56:18.967
MATT: There are definitely two rooms

3355
02:56:18.967 --> 02:56:21.257
that have the higher quality bedsheets.

3356
02:56:21.257 --> 02:56:23.307
One of them is springier, it seems like it's a newer design,

3357
02:56:23.307 --> 02:56:24.369
that'd be the third one over,

3358
02:56:24.369 --> 02:56:25.890
that one is definitely--
MARISHA: I take that one.

3359
02:56:25.890 --> 02:56:27.167
LAURA: That's the one, we go with that one.

3360
02:56:27.167 --> 02:56:29.208
MARISHA: I say: This one's Jester's and Beau's!

3361
02:56:29.208 --> 02:56:30.646
To the rest of the group.

3362
02:56:30.646 --> 02:56:31.552
MATT: Locked it in.

3363
02:56:31.552 --> 02:56:36.552
That's my favorite use of an investigation check to date.

3364
02:56:36.765 --> 02:56:39.346
TALIESIN: Detect thread count.

3365
02:56:39.346 --> 02:56:40.845
TRAVIS: Detect thread count.

3366
02:56:40.845 --> 02:56:43.387
MATT: 3rd-level slot, though.

3367
02:56:43.387 --> 02:56:46.654
You guys correspond which rooms are yours

3368
02:56:46.654 --> 02:56:51.654
and then eventually reconvene in one of the rooms to meet.

3369
02:56:51.661 --> 02:56:53.226
LIAM: In the love suite.

3370
02:56:53.226 --> 02:56:56.276
TRAVIS: Did we also lose the tripod? The stand?

3371
02:56:56.276 --> 02:56:57.734
LAURA: No, that's in my bag still.

3372
02:56:57.734 --> 02:56:59.438
MATT: Tripod's still in there.
TRAVIS: Just checking.

3373
02:56:59.438 --> 02:57:01.149
SAM: Well.

3374
02:57:01.149 --> 02:57:04.773
LAURA: Let's meet in Caleb and Fjord's room.

3375
02:57:04.773 --> 02:57:05.860
SAM: Sure.

3376
02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:08.952
LIAM: Are they all the identical size, all four.

3377
02:57:08.952 --> 02:57:10.400
SAM: With slightly different variations.

3378
02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:11.775
MATT: Yeah, they're all comparable.

3379
02:57:11.775 --> 02:57:13.124
The corner one's a little larger

3380
02:57:13.124 --> 02:57:14.816
but only because it doesn't have to compete for space

3381
02:57:14.816 --> 02:57:15.739
with adjacent.
LIAM: The couple might have

3382
02:57:15.739 --> 02:57:17.814
gotten the suite.
LAURA: Yeah, they did.

3383
02:57:17.814 --> 02:57:20.504
I just don't want to, you know, barge in on them

3384
02:57:20.504 --> 02:57:23.373
when they might want some privacy.

3385
02:57:23.373 --> 02:57:25.301
TRAVIS: Okay, all right, they're going to have their time.

3386
02:57:25.301 --> 02:57:27.958
Listen, so maybe we should discuss what we want to do.

3387
02:57:27.958 --> 02:57:30.264
About what time is it supposed to be

3388
02:57:30.264 --> 02:57:31.966
even though it doesn't look like it outside?

3389
02:57:31.966 --> 02:57:33.299
LIAM: Oh, well, it's--

3390
02:57:33.299 --> 02:57:35.557
MATT: By this time, it's late afternoon.

3391
02:57:35.557 --> 02:57:36.748
LIAM: Late afternoon.

3392
02:57:36.748 --> 02:57:40.060
TRAVIS: Excellent, so maybe we get a nice, long rest

3393
02:57:40.060 --> 02:57:42.076
and start out tomorrow, but I'm sure there are things

3394
02:57:42.076 --> 02:57:43.978
that people want to explore, right?

3395
02:57:43.978 --> 02:57:46.541
TALIESIN: I'd like to do a little shopping.

3396
02:57:46.541 --> 02:57:47.696
TRAVIS: Let's toss them out.

3397
02:57:47.696 --> 02:57:49.609
You said a blacksmith earlier, right?

3398
02:57:49.609 --> 02:57:53.124
TALIESIN: Yeah. Keep hoping to deal with this.

3399
02:57:53.124 --> 02:57:54.097
TRAVIS: I'll join you with that.

3400
02:57:54.097 --> 02:57:57.195
I'm sure you want to find the Firmament?

3401
02:57:57.195 --> 02:57:58.763
MARISHA: Yeah, I'd like to go to that library

3402
02:57:58.763 --> 02:58:00.982
or the Marble Tomes.

3403
02:58:00.982 --> 02:58:03.205
TALIESIN: We can find another diamond.

3404
02:58:03.205 --> 02:58:04.346
Find some healing potions.

3405
02:58:04.346 --> 02:58:06.855
SAM: We're supposed to visit Professor Waccoh.

3406
02:58:06.855 --> 02:58:08.677
MARISHA: Who's at the Marble Tomes.

3407
02:58:08.677 --> 02:58:13.022
LIAM: I suggest we spend a decent amount of time here.

3408
02:58:13.022 --> 02:58:15.465
TRAVIS: Yeah, the money is also at the Marble Tomes, right?

3409
02:58:15.465 --> 02:58:16.565
The professor?

3410
02:58:16.565 --> 02:58:18.541
LAURA: Yeah.

3411
02:58:18.541 --> 02:58:20.135
TALIESIN: We do need another diamond also

3412
02:58:20.135 --> 02:58:22.485
and we do need some healing potions.

3413
02:58:22.485 --> 02:58:25.447
And we need to figure out what's to be done

3414
02:58:25.447 --> 02:58:28.027
with our new companion.

3415
02:58:28.027 --> 02:58:30.776
MARISHA: Also, apparently Dairon is supposed to be here.

3416
02:58:30.776 --> 02:58:32.199
LAURA: Wait a minute.

3417
02:58:32.199 --> 02:58:35.207
Caleb, you said you could send

3418
02:58:35.207 --> 02:58:39.272
us to Nicodranas if we want to, yeah?

3419
02:58:39.272 --> 02:58:41.864
LIAM: I'm close.

3420
02:58:41.864 --> 02:58:45.655
I need to do a bit of homework.

3421
02:58:45.655 --> 02:58:49.955
Not much. I also need some paper.

3422
02:58:49.955 --> 02:58:52.004
SAM: More paper?
LIAM: And ink.

3423
02:58:52.004 --> 02:58:53.264
LAURA: Oh no.

3424
02:58:53.264 --> 02:58:54.968
LIAM: I need to work things out.

3425
02:58:54.968 --> 02:58:57.749
But I always need more paper.

3426
02:58:57.749 --> 02:58:59.178
MARISHA: Hey, did we divvy up our cash

3427
02:58:59.178 --> 02:59:01.093
that we got from Lady Olios?
SAM: Oh, no, we didn't.

3428
02:59:01.093 --> 02:59:04.001
2000 gold split seven ways.

3429
02:59:04.001 --> 02:59:05.926
MARISHA: Yeah.

3430
02:59:05.926 --> 02:59:07.621
MATT: Yeza goes,

3431
02:59:07.621 --> 02:59:09.468
"Wait, how much money?"

3432
02:59:09.468 --> 02:59:11.972
SAM: Oh, things are different now, babe.

3433
02:59:11.972 --> 02:59:14.455
We, um, we're, we--

3434
02:59:14.455 --> 02:59:18.322
MARISHA: We risk our lives for ridiculous sums of gold.

3435
02:59:19.169 --> 02:59:21.579
Also, we're pirates.

3436
02:59:21.579 --> 02:59:23.858
TRAVIS: 285 for everybody, there you go.

3437
02:59:23.858 --> 02:59:26.388
MATT: Yeza's eyes go wide, like--

3438
02:59:26.388 --> 02:59:27.412
SAM: Yeah.

3439
02:59:27.412 --> 02:59:31.312
These guys have gotten me into a new line of work.

3440
02:59:31.312 --> 02:59:36.312
Chemistry's good, baby, but killing's better.

3441
02:59:36.536 --> 02:59:38.953
MARISHA: "But killing is better."

3442
02:59:38.953 --> 02:59:40.569
MATT: "Killing?"

3443
02:59:40.569 --> 02:59:44.284
SAM: Only when, when it's a defense thing.

3444
02:59:44.284 --> 02:59:47.199
We've only, in self-defense.

3445
02:59:47.199 --> 02:59:50.523
TALIESIN: That's patently untrue.

3446
02:59:50.523 --> 02:59:53.473
LIAM: You're being facetious.

3447
02:59:53.473 --> 02:59:56.452
Adventure, you mean, yes, there has been

3448
02:59:56.452 --> 02:59:59.929
violence on the road. We've been attacked multiple times.

3449
02:59:59.929 --> 03:00:01.287
TRAVIS: We are mass murderers.

3450
03:00:01.287 --> 03:00:02.563
MARISHA: Yeah, it's kind of true.

3451
03:00:02.563 --> 03:00:04.190
LIAM: That's not true.
LAURA: We're pirates, though.

3452
03:00:04.190 --> 03:00:05.704
We are pirates.

3453
03:00:05.704 --> 03:00:07.115
MATT: "So you're mercenaries?"

3454
03:00:07.115 --> 03:00:09.660
SAM: Yes.
LIAM: That's true.

3455
03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:11.431
LAURA: Yes.
TALIESIN: Sometimes.

3456
03:00:11.431 --> 03:00:15.582
MATT: "That's actually pretty neat.

3457
03:00:15.582 --> 03:00:18.050
"Wow, my wife's a mercenary!"

3458
03:00:18.050 --> 03:00:20.369
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

3459
03:00:20.369 --> 03:00:21.975
MATT: "What have you killed?"

3460
03:00:21.975 --> 03:00:26.090
SAM: Oh, what was that big thing with the baby?

3461
03:00:26.090 --> 03:00:27.834
LIAM: The manticore.
SAM: Manticore?

3462
03:00:27.834 --> 03:00:31.883
MATT: "You killed a manticore?!"

3463
03:00:31.883 --> 03:00:32.880
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3464
03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:35.847
Nott-- Veth killed a manticore.

3465
03:00:35.847 --> 03:00:38.780
SAM: Yeah, and there were some other things, too.

3466
03:00:38.780 --> 03:00:39.758
Some gnolls.

3467
03:00:39.758 --> 03:00:41.550
LAURA: Yeah, lots of gnolls.
SAM: Regular ones.

3468
03:00:41.550 --> 03:00:44.676
MATT: "Oh, yes, the gnolls are a problem out there, yeah.

3469
03:00:44.676 --> 03:00:46.742
"We've had them become issues

3470
03:00:46.742 --> 03:00:48.540
"on the outskirts of Felderwin."

3471
03:00:48.540 --> 03:00:51.221
LIAM: A giant clockwork mechanized killing machine.

3472
03:00:51.221 --> 03:00:53.262
LAURA: We got attacked by a giant blue dragon.

3473
03:00:53.262 --> 03:00:55.225
SAM: What was that crazy demon thing we just fought

3474
03:00:55.225 --> 03:00:56.399
in the last--

3475
03:00:56.399 --> 03:00:58.049
LAURA: I don't even know what that was,

3476
03:00:58.049 --> 03:01:00.050
but definitely succubuses and stuff.

3477
03:01:00.050 --> 03:01:02.560
SAM: Don't we have some of the organs?

3478
03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:03.836
LAURA: Oh, we have a heart.

3479
03:01:03.836 --> 03:01:05.839
TRAVIS: No, they all turned to sludge.

3480
03:01:05.839 --> 03:01:08.843
MATT and TRAVIS: Except for the heart.

3481
03:01:08.843 --> 03:01:09.722
MARISHA: It's in the bag.

3482
03:01:09.722 --> 03:01:12.358
SAM: We should show him the heart.

3483
03:01:12.358 --> 03:01:16.345
MATT: "What is going on?!"

3484
03:01:16.345 --> 03:01:17.553
TRAVIS: Can you science that?

3485
03:01:17.553 --> 03:01:19.297
MARISHA: Yeah, do you know what that came from?

3486
03:01:19.297 --> 03:01:20.870
MATT: He goes forward and looks.

3487
03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:22.520
"Well, it looks like the outskirts of it

3488
03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:23.661
are heavily cauterized.

3489
03:01:23.661 --> 03:01:26.406
"There's definitely no blood flow from the standpoint there.

3490
03:01:26.406 --> 03:01:29.163
"I can't even surmise the sludgy texture.

3491
03:01:29.163 --> 03:01:34.163
"I don't even know what, wow, this is-- you guys."

3492
03:01:34.184 --> 03:01:39.184
SAM: It started as a hobby, but then it got more intense

3493
03:01:39.636 --> 03:01:42.119
and now, you know.

3494
03:01:44.411 --> 03:01:48.934
MATT: "The farthest I've been is Zadash.

3495
03:01:48.934 --> 03:01:50.855
"I want to hear about all the places you've been."

3496
03:01:50.855 --> 03:01:53.338
LAURA: Oh, you guys have so much catching up to do.

3497
03:01:53.338 --> 03:01:54.865
It's so cute.

3498
03:01:54.865 --> 03:01:56.474
SAM: Yeah.

3499
03:01:56.474 --> 03:02:00.897
Hey, you know, we've been through a lot.

3500
03:02:00.897 --> 03:02:03.144
I didn't think I would ever see you again, alive.

3501
03:02:03.144 --> 03:02:06.003
I sort of want to, I know this is sappy or whatever,

3502
03:02:06.003 --> 03:02:09.212
and maybe you won't want to do it, but

3503
03:02:09.212 --> 03:02:12.998
I sort of want to commemorate this somehow.

3504
03:02:12.998 --> 03:02:15.445
LAURA: With a bone.

3505
03:02:15.445 --> 03:02:17.950
SAM: No, I was thinking with a tattoo.

3506
03:02:17.950 --> 03:02:20.684
LAURA: I could do that!

3507
03:02:20.684 --> 03:02:21.812
MATT: "What?"

3508
03:02:21.812 --> 03:02:23.983
LAURA: What do you want?

3509
03:02:23.983 --> 03:02:26.477
SAM: Well,

3510
03:02:26.477 --> 03:02:28.231
I was thinking.

3511
03:02:28.231 --> 03:02:30.938
SAM: You and I could get tattoos.

3512
03:02:30.938 --> 03:02:35.704
LAURA: Oh, Yeza, I do want to do that for you.

3513
03:02:35.704 --> 03:02:38.762
(laughter)

3514
03:02:38.762 --> 03:02:40.421
TRAVIS: Jester, I don't think anybody asked.

3515
03:02:40.421 --> 03:02:41.789
LAURA: Make a persuasion check.

3516
03:02:41.789 --> 03:02:44.176
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

3517
03:02:44.176 --> 03:02:46.551
SAM: Well, I don't know what level I am now.

3518
03:02:46.551 --> 03:02:48.206
MATT: Well, you guys haven't leveled yet, but--

3519
03:02:48.206 --> 03:02:51.514
SAM: So it's 13 minus three,

3520
03:02:51.514 --> 03:02:53.522
so that's ten.

3521
03:02:53.522 --> 03:02:56.844
MATT: Ten, all right, that's passable for the situation.

3522
03:02:56.844 --> 03:03:00.419
He goes, "Okay."

3523
03:03:00.419 --> 03:03:05.311
SAM: Oh, wait, persuasion is zero, so that's just 13, okay.

3524
03:03:05.311 --> 03:03:07.853
MATT: "Okay, yeah, where?"

3525
03:03:07.853 --> 03:03:09.111
LAURA: Where?

3526
03:03:09.111 --> 03:03:12.746
On your ring fingers?

3527
03:03:12.746 --> 03:03:14.748
SAM: Sure, yes.

3528
03:03:14.748 --> 03:03:19.073
Yes, and maybe on him you could do-- he can help you--

3529
03:03:19.073 --> 03:03:23.111
the molecular structure of sugar.

3530
03:03:23.111 --> 03:03:27.117
And I could have the molecular structure of salt.

3531
03:03:27.117 --> 03:03:28.691
LAURA: Aw, that's really sweet.

3532
03:03:28.691 --> 03:03:30.148
MATT: "That's actually very sweet."

3533
03:03:30.148 --> 03:03:31.471
SAM: Seems advanced.

3534
03:03:31.471 --> 03:03:34.165
MARISHA: That's a lot of detail in a small space.

3535
03:03:34.165 --> 03:03:35.434
SAM: Well, he knows all this stuff.

3536
03:03:35.434 --> 03:03:36.542
LAURA: Okay, it's a finger, though,

3537
03:03:36.542 --> 03:03:37.756
so I just want you to know.

3538
03:03:37.756 --> 03:03:39.237
SAM: Okay, well, then, how about just a heart?

3539
03:03:39.237 --> 03:03:40.352
How about just a heart?

3540
03:03:40.352 --> 03:03:41.403
LAURA: Yeah, I could probably do that.

3541
03:03:41.403 --> 03:03:42.351
SAM: That's probably easier.

3542
03:03:42.351 --> 03:03:44.644
Also, with your skill level,

3543
03:03:44.644 --> 03:03:47.669
maybe just a circle. How about just a ring?

3544
03:03:47.669 --> 03:03:48.974
LAURA: It might just be a blob, honestly.

3545
03:03:48.974 --> 03:03:51.349
SAM: Like a ring? Yeah, we'll do a ring.

3546
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:52.750
It's way easier.

3547
03:03:52.750 --> 03:03:55.971
LIAM: Seafaring DNA.

3548
03:03:55.971 --> 03:03:57.575
SAM: How about, yeah, rings, rings.

3549
03:03:57.575 --> 03:04:00.300
LAURA: Although, anything on your finger is kind of hard.

3550
03:04:00.300 --> 03:04:02.030
I'm just putting that out there.

3551
03:04:02.030 --> 03:04:06.447
SAM: Okay, how about just a dot?

3552
03:04:06.447 --> 03:04:07.763
Like a big dot.

3553
03:04:07.763 --> 03:04:08.796
LAURA: I like it.

3554
03:04:08.796 --> 03:04:11.596
I'm going to try to make the dot look like a heart, though.

3555
03:04:11.596 --> 03:04:13.735
SAM: Great. If it works out, great.

3556
03:04:13.735 --> 03:04:15.518
LAURA: We'll see what happens. It might just be a blob.

3557
03:04:15.518 --> 03:04:16.351
SAM: I'm not going to have

3558
03:04:16.351 --> 03:04:18.470
this body for long anyway, right?!

3559
03:04:18.470 --> 03:04:21.045
LAURA: When you get a new one, I'll do a better one.

3560
03:04:21.045 --> 03:04:21.953
SAM: Sure, sure.

3561
03:04:21.953 --> 03:04:23.299
LAURA: This will be practice round.

3562
03:04:23.299 --> 03:04:24.377
MATT: "Okay."

3563
03:04:24.377 --> 03:04:26.581
TALIESIN: For one of them.

3564
03:04:26.581 --> 03:04:28.677
SAM: I'll do you first so I practice,

3565
03:04:28.677 --> 03:04:30.388
because his is more permanent.
SAM: Practice on me, for sure.

3566
03:04:30.388 --> 03:04:32.352
LAURA: Okay.

3567
03:04:32.352 --> 03:04:34.313
MATT: Go ahead and roll a dexterity check.

3568
03:04:34.313 --> 03:04:38.213
LAURA: Oh, my first roll of the night.

3569
03:04:39.276 --> 03:04:40.542
Oh!

3570
03:04:40.542 --> 03:04:44.220
That was so close to being good!

3571
03:04:44.220 --> 03:04:47.062
Dexterity check, seven.

3572
03:04:47.062 --> 03:04:51.045
MATT: Seven, okay.

3573
03:04:51.045 --> 03:04:54.233
At the right angle, it looks heart-like.

3574
03:04:54.233 --> 03:04:56.029
Otherwise, it looks more like a bean.

3575
03:04:56.029 --> 03:04:58.959
LAURA: A bean, a happy bean on your finger!

3576
03:04:58.959 --> 03:04:59.834
MATT: It's a finger bean.

3577
03:04:59.834 --> 03:05:02.314
SAM: It's something to remember.

3578
03:05:02.314 --> 03:05:04.505
Can you try a little harder on him?

3579
03:05:04.505 --> 03:05:07.558
LAURA: That's what yours looks like; it's so cute!

3580
03:05:07.558 --> 03:05:09.760
SAM: Okay, so it might be this, sort of.

3581
03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:12.525
MATT: Kind of at the right angle.

3582
03:05:12.525 --> 03:05:15.601
LAURA: Now I get advantage because I've practiced one time.

3583
03:05:15.601 --> 03:05:18.970
(laughter)

3584
03:05:18.970 --> 03:05:21.645
MATT: Sure.
LAURA: Yay!

3585
03:05:24.921 --> 03:05:26.437
TALIESIN: Wow!

3586
03:05:26.437 --> 03:05:29.707
(laughter)

3587
03:05:29.707 --> 03:05:30.765
LAURA: Ten.

3588
03:05:30.765 --> 03:05:32.742
MATT: Ten, okay, it is a heart!

3589
03:05:32.742 --> 03:05:34.063
LAURA: Yay!

3590
03:05:34.063 --> 03:05:35.822
(cheering)

3591
03:05:35.822 --> 03:05:37.420
TRAVIS: Love lives!

3592
03:05:37.420 --> 03:05:41.191
(laughter)

3593
03:05:41.191 --> 03:05:43.265
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

3594
03:05:43.265 --> 03:05:46.139
That's accurate.

3595
03:05:46.139 --> 03:05:47.914
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yay!

3596
03:05:47.914 --> 03:05:52.214
TRAVIS: All right, so, tomorrow, we rest tonight.

3597
03:05:52.214 --> 03:05:55.520
Visit the Marble Tomes, we'll find a blacksmith,

3598
03:05:55.520 --> 03:05:59.624
we'll also find some paper, maybe a jeweler for a diamond,

3599
03:05:59.624 --> 03:06:01.179
anything like that.

3600
03:06:01.179 --> 03:06:03.607
SAM: What do I do with my husband?

3601
03:06:03.607 --> 03:06:05.635
LIAM: Yeah, I feel like we are talking about

3602
03:06:05.635 --> 03:06:07.129
specifics on a micro level,

3603
03:06:07.129 --> 03:06:09.266
but let's talk macro for a moment.

3604
03:06:09.266 --> 03:06:11.500
What are we doing?

3605
03:06:11.500 --> 03:06:14.851
SAM: Are we allying with the Dynasty?

3606
03:06:14.851 --> 03:06:16.853
TALIESIN: For the moment, we are

3607
03:06:16.853 --> 03:06:19.495
moving with the circumstances.

3608
03:06:19.495 --> 03:06:22.503
SAM: Are you okay with that, Beau?

3609
03:06:22.503 --> 03:06:26.639
MARISHA: I think I could make it work to my advantage, yeah.

3610
03:06:26.639 --> 03:06:29.137
It just depends on our long game.

3611
03:06:29.137 --> 03:06:32.510
LIAM: Yeah, for the moment, we are staying alive.

3612
03:06:32.510 --> 03:06:36.133
What do we want to do together I think is

3613
03:06:36.133 --> 03:06:39.277
what we need to figure out after this day.

3614
03:06:39.277 --> 03:06:41.794
MARISHA: We ran from this war for a really long time,

3615
03:06:41.794 --> 03:06:43.270
and now we're right in the middle of it.

3616
03:06:43.270 --> 03:06:45.746
I don't know how much longer we can avoid this.

3617
03:06:45.746 --> 03:06:48.044
LAURA: Yeah, but what are we going to do with it?

3618
03:06:48.044 --> 03:06:50.149
I mean, do we think we're really going to, like,

3619
03:06:50.149 --> 03:06:53.126
help something or end it, or are we going to make it worse?

3620
03:06:53.126 --> 03:06:57.064
Are we going to get everyone in the Empire killed?

3621
03:06:57.064 --> 03:07:00.286
What if we do stuff for the Bright Queen

3622
03:07:00.286 --> 03:07:02.036
and then because she likes us so much,

3623
03:07:02.036 --> 03:07:06.399
we can talk her into not really trying to kill everyone?

3624
03:07:06.399 --> 03:07:09.108
MARISHA: Leave every place better than you found it.

3625
03:07:09.108 --> 03:07:10.766
LAURA: Aw.

3626
03:07:10.766 --> 03:07:12.999
MARISHA: That's really the only direction

3627
03:07:12.999 --> 03:07:14.490
I have at the moment.

3628
03:07:14.490 --> 03:07:18.090
SAM: We can't do any of that until we have trust.

3629
03:07:18.090 --> 03:07:21.674
MARISHA: Stay alive and listen and something else.

3630
03:07:21.674 --> 03:07:23.882
SAM: But we won't be able to leave this place

3631
03:07:23.882 --> 03:07:26.890
better than we found it unless we have some sort of

3632
03:07:26.890 --> 03:07:31.427
prominence or power of position or trust anyway, with her.

3633
03:07:31.427 --> 03:07:34.026
LIAM: We have the beginnings of that.

3634
03:07:34.026 --> 03:07:38.242
TALIESIN: We have to continue to serve each other,

3635
03:07:38.242 --> 03:07:41.069
above all else.

3636
03:07:41.069 --> 03:07:43.520
And serve life, above all else,

3637
03:07:43.520 --> 03:07:45.555
and I think everything else will work out.

3638
03:07:45.555 --> 03:07:50.247
The situation that anybody finds themselves in is just that.

3639
03:07:50.247 --> 03:07:53.276
We're in a place, there's a power structure,

3640
03:07:53.276 --> 03:07:55.711
we're going to adapt to it.

3641
03:07:55.711 --> 03:07:57.656
As long as stay true to each other,

3642
03:07:57.656 --> 03:07:59.761
I think everything's going to be fine.

3643
03:07:59.761 --> 03:08:04.711
LIAM: I would like to propose something, as a goal.

3644
03:08:06.542 --> 03:08:11.155
I think we should stop a war,

3645
03:08:11.155 --> 03:08:16.089
and I think we will do that by cutting the cancer out of

3646
03:08:17.516 --> 03:08:20.510
our homeland.

3647
03:08:20.510 --> 03:08:23.100
These are not different things.

3648
03:08:23.100 --> 03:08:24.996
What you and your mentor are talking about,

3649
03:08:24.996 --> 03:08:26.658
what I am talking about.

3650
03:08:26.658 --> 03:08:30.000
MARISHA: No, they're not.

3651
03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.309
I hear you.

3652
03:08:32.309 --> 03:08:36.292
I'm just a little bit concerned on your personal motives,

3653
03:08:36.292 --> 03:08:39.572
which you're still very enigmatic about.

3654
03:08:39.572 --> 03:08:41.835
LIAM: (sighs)

3655
03:08:41.835 --> 03:08:42.934
MARISHA: How much do you care

3656
03:08:42.934 --> 03:08:44.322
and how much are you using us, Caleb?

3657
03:08:44.322 --> 03:08:45.818
LIAM: We're telling you a lot, Yeza.

3658
03:08:45.818 --> 03:08:48.133
This is a lot all at once.

3659
03:08:48.133 --> 03:08:53.133
The people that you were working for,

3660
03:08:53.391 --> 03:08:58.391
some of their associates, if not all of them are,

3661
03:08:58.555 --> 03:09:03.530
their souls are black as pitch.

3662
03:09:03.530 --> 03:09:08.349
The Cerberus Assembly.

3663
03:09:08.349 --> 03:09:11.614
MATT: "They're some-- they're a fine piece of work."

3664
03:09:11.614 --> 03:09:12.913
LIAM: Yeah.

3665
03:09:12.913 --> 03:09:14.813
MATT: "At least, what little interaction

3666
03:09:14.813 --> 03:09:18.055
I've had with them."

3667
03:09:18.055 --> 03:09:21.500
LIAM: What Beauregard is referring to is my connection

3668
03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:26.500
to the Cerberus Assembly a long time ago.

3669
03:09:29.086 --> 03:09:32.340
TALIESIN: Was this what you've been walking towards?

3670
03:09:32.340 --> 03:09:36.423
Is this the destiny that you've been looking for?

3671
03:09:37.511 --> 03:09:41.236
LIAM: I don't know about destiny.

3672
03:09:42.769 --> 03:09:44.652
TALIESIN: Is it what you're for,

3673
03:09:44.652 --> 03:09:48.092
I suppose is what I'm asking?

3674
03:09:48.092 --> 03:09:50.750
LIAM: Maybe.

3675
03:09:52.588 --> 03:09:54.378
TALIESIN: I believe that we are walking

3676
03:09:54.378 --> 03:09:57.700
a very specific path right now,

3677
03:09:57.700 --> 03:10:02.143
and I think that we're all here for a reason.

3678
03:10:02.143 --> 03:10:06.842
I think that we're going to find

3679
03:10:06.842 --> 03:10:10.494
servants of

3680
03:10:10.494 --> 03:10:12.629
death on both sides of this,

3681
03:10:12.629 --> 03:10:14.263
if this is the path we're choosing to walk

3682
03:10:14.263 --> 03:10:17.222
and I think it'll be our job to hold

3683
03:10:17.222 --> 03:10:20.289
as much of that accountable as possible.

3684
03:10:20.289 --> 03:10:24.472
If this is what we're choosing to do.

3685
03:10:28.495 --> 03:10:30.878
MARISHA: What are you doing? What?

3686
03:10:30.878 --> 03:10:35.862
LIAM: Yes, I was trained to be a terrible person.

3687
03:10:37.800 --> 03:10:41.633
Yes, I was a student of the Cerberus Assembly.

3688
03:10:43.152 --> 03:10:46.735
Yes, I murdered those most dear to me, yes.

3689
03:10:49.063 --> 03:10:52.813
And yes, I want to see specific people dead.

3690
03:10:54.449 --> 03:10:56.063
If that lines up with something

3691
03:10:56.063 --> 03:10:58.620
that can save where you and I are from,

3692
03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:02.600
where Veth and Yeza are from, where our friends live.

3693
03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:04.134
LAURA: Kiri.

3694
03:11:04.134 --> 03:11:06.102
SAM: Pumat.

3695
03:11:06.102 --> 03:11:07.502
LAURA: My dad, maybe.

3696
03:11:07.502 --> 03:11:08.927
TALIESIN: Your mom.

3697
03:11:08.927 --> 03:11:12.002
LIAM: Then all is one.

3698
03:11:13.153 --> 03:11:17.486
MARISHA: It's not you seeking retribution that concerns me.

3699
03:11:20.914 --> 03:11:24.637
What do you want to do with this dunamancy shit?

3700
03:11:24.637 --> 03:11:27.054
Your interest in time bending.

3701
03:11:29.406 --> 03:11:31.763
LIAM: Time bending?

3702
03:11:31.763 --> 03:11:33.604
MARISHA: Isn't that what this is all leading towards?

3703
03:11:33.604 --> 03:11:36.492
LIAM: I never said anything to you about time bending.

3704
03:11:36.492 --> 03:11:39.135
MARISHA: You're interested in the study of time.

3705
03:11:39.135 --> 03:11:40.882
That's what you were looking at in the library.

3706
03:11:40.882 --> 03:11:43.217
LIAM: I never said any such thing to you.

3707
03:11:43.217 --> 03:11:47.584
MARISHA: You told me that in the library.

3708
03:11:50.696 --> 03:11:52.871
Just a little.

3709
03:11:54.540 --> 03:11:56.505
You still have the vial, right, from Yeza?

3710
03:11:56.505 --> 03:11:58.205
LIAM: Yes.

3711
03:11:58.205 --> 03:12:00.064
MATT: "Wait, what?"

3712
03:12:00.064 --> 03:12:01.780
SAM: Oh.

3713
03:12:01.780 --> 03:12:05.046
We got some stuff from the house.

3714
03:12:05.046 --> 03:12:05.954
We have the--

3715
03:12:05.954 --> 03:12:06.787
LAURA: A tripody thing.

3716
03:12:06.787 --> 03:12:08.812
SAM: The tripody thing.

3717
03:12:08.812 --> 03:12:11.429
MATT: "Oh, yeah, they placed the box on that."

3718
03:12:11.429 --> 03:12:13.377
SAM: Was it special in any way?

3719
03:12:13.377 --> 03:12:16.444
MATT: "I don't know, that belonged to the lady."

3720
03:12:16.444 --> 03:12:18.110
SAM: We have it.

3721
03:12:18.110 --> 03:12:21.018
We also have a vial. Was it full?

3722
03:12:21.018 --> 03:12:23.693
TRAVIS: Yeah. Had a bunch of liquidy gray stuff in it.

3723
03:12:23.693 --> 03:12:26.183
MATT: "I think that's probably the one that we completed."

3724
03:12:26.183 --> 03:12:28.232
SAM: They didn't take it with them?

3725
03:12:28.232 --> 03:12:30.207
MATT: "I was supposed to use it and continue to study it

3726
03:12:30.207 --> 03:12:31.845
"there and see if I can replicate the process.

3727
03:12:31.845 --> 03:12:34.853
"That was part of my job when I was left there alone,

3728
03:12:34.853 --> 03:12:37.388
"was to try and find a way to streamline it."

3729
03:12:37.388 --> 03:12:38.878
TALIESIN: Well, does that bring me a thought.

3730
03:12:38.878 --> 03:12:39.980
MATT: "That's the one."

3731
03:12:39.980 --> 03:12:41.864
MARISHA: What's it do?

3732
03:12:41.864 --> 03:12:43.625
MATT: "I don't know.

3733
03:12:43.625 --> 03:12:45.932
"It wasn't my job to study the specifics of it,

3734
03:12:45.932 --> 03:12:48.772
"I just had to find a way to take its properties of the

3735
03:12:48.772 --> 03:12:53.230
"ethereal energy and distill it

3736
03:12:53.230 --> 03:12:55.717
into an imbibable fluid."

3737
03:12:55.717 --> 03:12:56.827
TRAVIS: Yeah, reproduce it.

3738
03:12:56.827 --> 03:12:58.781
SAM: You could do it again if you needed to.

3739
03:12:58.781 --> 03:13:00.473
MATT: "With the right materials

3740
03:13:00.473 --> 03:13:02.644
"and with one of those box things, yeah."

3741
03:13:02.644 --> 03:13:05.416
TRAVIS: Yeah, mm-mm, mm-mm.

3742
03:13:05.416 --> 03:13:07.071
SAM: What was the chair?

3743
03:13:07.071 --> 03:13:10.795
(laughter)

3744
03:13:10.795 --> 03:13:14.700
MATT: "You don't want to know about the chair."

3745
03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:15.624
LAURA: Yes!

3746
03:13:15.624 --> 03:13:18.025
SAM: I shouldn't have brought it up, I'm sorry.

3747
03:13:18.025 --> 03:13:20.063
I just hold him.

3748
03:13:20.063 --> 03:13:24.646
MATT: You see this chair scar mark on the side of his neck.

3749
03:13:29.617 --> 03:13:30.883
"You're not all talking about

3750
03:13:30.883 --> 03:13:33.251
"going to war with the Empire, are you?"

3751
03:13:33.251 --> 03:13:35.464
LAURA and LIAM: No.

3752
03:13:35.464 --> 03:13:36.803
TALIESIN: No.

3753
03:13:36.803 --> 03:13:39.793
SAM: We're talking about being strategic and specific

3754
03:13:39.793 --> 03:13:42.168
in our alliances.

3755
03:13:42.168 --> 03:13:46.668
MATT: "I know times are rough there and I know that

3756
03:13:48.363 --> 03:13:51.946

SAM: Monsters?

3770
03:14:37.773 --> 03:14:38.664
MATT: "Yes."

3771
03:14:38.664 --> 03:14:41.472
TRAVIS: No, you're not wrong, Yeza.

3772
03:14:41.472 --> 03:14:45.359
I think some of us, and I admire this,

3773
03:14:45.359 --> 03:14:48.567
have a great appetite for resolution.

3774
03:14:48.567 --> 03:14:51.584
I'm with you, I don't know who to trust

3775
03:14:51.584 --> 03:14:54.872
and, as admirable as that notion is,

3776
03:14:54.872 --> 03:14:59.620
I can't even begin to wrap my mind around stopping a war.

3777
03:14:59.620 --> 03:15:01.717
I mean, that's just seven of us.

3778
03:15:01.717 --> 03:15:04.050
We're talking about nations.

3779
03:15:05.233 --> 03:15:09.491
No, we're not trusting anyone yet.

3780
03:15:09.491 --> 03:15:10.825
MATT: "Look, I--"

3781
03:15:10.825 --> 03:15:14.341
SAM: And some monsters you can trust.

3782
03:15:17.524 --> 03:15:21.730
MATT: "I'm just a country boy with a knack for

3783

"books and mixing things.

in situations like this."

3793
03:15:50.166 --> 03:15:54.480
MARISHA: Well, maybe Fjord is right.

3794
03:15:54.480 --> 03:15:59.480
Talking on a macro scale is good, but

3795
03:16:00.396 --> 03:16:05.396
what are the next, you know, medium steps?

3796
03:16:05.749 --> 03:16:09.283
We talked small, we talked big.

3797
03:16:09.283 --> 03:16:12.719
LAURA: We could try taking this Waccoh job or whatever

3798
03:16:12.719 --> 03:16:14.143
and see what kind of people

3799
03:16:14.143 --> 03:16:16.643
we would be working for, you know?

3800
03:16:16.643 --> 03:16:19.451
LIAM: We bolster the trust of

3801
03:16:19.451 --> 03:16:23.605
these people we are with right now.

3802
03:16:23.605 --> 03:16:26.468
SAM: Learn more and then we'll be able to--

3803
03:16:26.468 --> 03:16:28.156
like you said before, Beau,

3804
03:16:28.156 --> 03:16:30.445
we need to know more before we can really

3805
03:16:30.445 --> 03:16:32.286
make any longterm plans.

3806
03:16:32.286 --> 03:16:33.544
MARISHA: That's true.

3807
03:16:35.234 --> 03:16:37.509
LAURA: Also, there's Traveler Con coming up

3808
03:16:37.509 --> 03:16:39.259
and I just don't know

3809
03:16:39.259 --> 03:16:42.512
where it's going to fall in this whole war situation.

3810
03:16:42.512 --> 03:16:43.470
SAM: It's a month away?

3811
03:16:43.470 --> 03:16:44.761
LIAM: How far off is that?

3812
03:16:44.761 --> 03:16:46.431
LAURA: Like a month, two months.

3813
03:16:46.431 --> 03:16:48.865
SAM: Did you get your badge yet?

3814
03:16:48.865 --> 03:16:50.506
LAURA: I haven't even found where it's at.

3815
03:16:50.506 --> 03:16:53.375
He hasn't told me and I'm getting

3816
03:16:53.375 --> 03:16:55.602
a little worried about it, honestly.

3817
03:16:55.602 --> 03:16:59.993
TALIESIN: There's a place I'm looking for, too.

3818
03:16:59.993 --> 03:17:02.178
And we're getting nearer.

3819
03:17:02.178 --> 03:17:03.381
MARISHA: Yeah.

3820
03:17:03.381 --> 03:17:04.672
TRAVIS: You mentioned that.

3821
03:17:04.672 --> 03:17:06.113
SAM: Yeah, a crematorium?

3822
03:17:06.113 --> 03:17:08.380
TRAVIS: Or a kiln in the mountains?

3823
03:17:08.380 --> 03:17:09.249
SAM: For bodies?

3824
03:17:09.249 --> 03:17:10.445
TALIESIN: Yes.

3825
03:17:10.445 --> 03:17:11.278
LAURA: What kind of bodies?

3826
03:17:11.278 --> 03:17:12.702
SAM: And you think it's here?

3827
03:17:12.702 --> 03:17:14.908
TALIESIN: I do, I think it's close.

3828
03:17:14.908 --> 03:17:17.399
TRAVIS: Who owns it, what is it made of?

3829
03:17:17.399 --> 03:17:18.684
How do you know about it?

3830
03:17:18.684 --> 03:17:22.151
TALIESIN: Well, that's complicated.

3831
03:17:22.151 --> 03:17:25.148
But there,

3832
03:17:27.046 --> 03:17:32.046
there is more than one way to honor the body of a hero.

3833
03:17:32.443 --> 03:17:37.443
There are, well, there is a small clearing

3834
03:17:37.516 --> 03:17:40.662
in the middle of a forest where you can

3835
03:17:40.662 --> 03:17:41.989
put someone beneath the ground

3836
03:17:41.989 --> 03:17:44.969
and something unusual springs forth.

3837
03:17:44.969 --> 03:17:49.335
There's a place where you can

3838
03:17:49.335 --> 03:17:53.202
burn the remains to an ash and

3839
03:17:53.202 --> 03:17:55.937
something unusual springs forth.

3840
03:17:55.937 --> 03:17:59.325
SAM: Something unusual like a new body or a plant?

3841
03:17:59.325 --> 03:18:02.576
TALIESIN: Just something unusual.

3842
03:18:02.576 --> 03:18:04.945
I've never been.

3843
03:18:04.945 --> 03:18:08.803
There are

3844
03:18:08.803 --> 03:18:13.778
three sacred sites of

3845
03:18:13.778 --> 03:18:15.885
my particular group of people

3846
03:18:15.885 --> 03:18:18.954
and the cemetery is just one of them,

3847
03:18:18.954 --> 03:18:21.232
the garden and the kiln is the next

3848
03:18:21.232 --> 03:18:24.157
and I'm hoping maybe if we find the kiln,

3849
03:18:24.157 --> 03:18:28.607
I can start to piece together what's happening to my home.

3850
03:18:28.607 --> 03:18:30.490
LAURA: Are you planning on burying a body there

3851
03:18:30.490 --> 03:18:32.907
or crematory-ing a body there?

3852
03:18:34.170 --> 03:18:37.377
TALIESIN: Well, I suppose whichever one of you I like least.

3853
03:18:37.377 --> 03:18:39.345
Yeah, that's a little joke.

3854
03:18:39.345 --> 03:18:41.100
TRAVIS: Caduceus humor.

3855
03:18:41.100 --> 03:18:43.448
TALIESIN: I'm working on it.

3856
03:18:43.448 --> 03:18:46.554
I think that they may have answers.

3857
03:18:46.554 --> 03:18:48.318
SAM: This place, forgive me,

3858
03:18:48.318 --> 03:18:51.635
I don't know much about it, but from what we've heard,

3859
03:18:51.635 --> 03:18:54.482
this place is all about eternal life

3860
03:18:54.482 --> 03:18:58.327
and preserving souls forever, not burning them

3861
03:18:58.327 --> 03:18:59.160
and ending them--

3862
03:18:59.160 --> 03:19:02.402
LAURA: Not everyone gets eternal life here.

3863
03:19:02.402 --> 03:19:06.194
SAM: Not everyone, but she was talking about

3864
03:19:06.194 --> 03:19:09.152
imagining a world where

3865
03:19:09.152 --> 03:19:10.833
you could control your own destiny

3866
03:19:10.833 --> 03:19:14.324
because everyone was sort of immortal, wasn't she?

3867
03:19:14.324 --> 03:19:16.652
LAURA: Yeah, I have a question about that, though.

3868
03:19:16.652 --> 03:19:19.076
What if somebody doesn't want to be?

3869
03:19:19.076 --> 03:19:20.702
Do they get stuck?
SAM: Consecuted?

3870
03:19:20.702 --> 03:19:22.906
LAURA: Yeah, do they have to be consecuted?

3871
03:19:22.906 --> 03:19:24.857
What if you get consecuted

3872
03:19:24.857 --> 03:19:28.307
and you realize, "Shit, I really wanted to pass on?

3873
03:19:28.307 --> 03:19:31.601
"I wanted to see what was on the other side?"

3874
03:19:31.601 --> 03:19:33.201
TRAVIS: Well, didn't anybody else think it was weird

3875
03:19:33.201 --> 03:19:36.670
that Shadowhand is still in his first life

3876
03:19:36.670 --> 03:19:38.266
and has a lot of, I don't know,

3877
03:19:38.266 --> 03:19:40.071
seems like a lot of clout around here.

3878
03:19:40.071 --> 03:19:41.671
TALIESIN: I get the sense that it's not something

3879
03:19:41.671 --> 03:19:46.671
that everybody gets, that it's a delicacy.

3880
03:19:46.889 --> 03:19:48.414
TRAVIS: It may be some are told they get

3881
03:19:48.414 --> 03:19:49.705
and maybe don't actually,

3882
03:19:49.705 --> 03:19:50.783
and maybe it's a way of preserving.

3883
03:19:50.783 --> 03:19:52.730
TALIESIN: I think maybe it's something you earn.

3884
03:19:52.730 --> 03:19:54.093
LIAM: A little too early to tell.

3885
03:19:54.093 --> 03:19:55.942
MARISHA: He mentioned he was a prodigy

3886
03:19:55.942 --> 03:19:58.996
at the dunamancy magic, so

3887
03:19:58.996 --> 03:20:01.993
I think that's what made him excel in ranks.

3888
03:20:01.993 --> 03:20:02.826
TRAVIS: Okay.

3889
03:20:02.826 --> 03:20:03.784
SAM: We don't know a lot.

3890
03:20:03.784 --> 03:20:06.221
TRAVIS: Yeah, we don't. There's a lot being thrown at us.

3891
03:20:06.221 --> 03:20:08.080
LIAM: No, I think we're going to stay here for a little bit

3892
03:20:08.080 --> 03:20:10.604
and get to know the culture.

3893
03:20:10.604 --> 03:20:11.879
TALIESIN: I feel like I'm going to find clues

3894
03:20:11.879 --> 03:20:15.254
as to where to go next to find the things I need to find.

3895
03:20:15.254 --> 03:20:17.854
MARISHA: We all eventually want to

3896
03:20:17.854 --> 03:20:20.987
be able to go home, right?

3897
03:20:20.987 --> 03:20:22.185
MATT: "Where's Luke?

3898
03:20:22.185 --> 03:20:23.752
"You said Alfield?"

3899
03:20:23.752 --> 03:20:25.365
SAM: He's with Edith in Alfield.

3900
03:20:25.365 --> 03:20:29.227
We have to figure out what to do with him, too.

3901
03:20:29.227 --> 03:20:30.795
TALIESIN: We may have to figure out, perhaps,

3902
03:20:30.795 --> 03:20:33.563
if there's a way to get you,

3903
03:20:33.563 --> 03:20:36.121
possibly back to the other side.

3904
03:20:36.121 --> 03:20:36.954
TRAVIS: Agreed.

3905
03:20:36.954 --> 03:20:37.787
MATT: "Okay."

3906
03:20:37.787 --> 03:20:40.638
LAURA: You can go to Nicodranas.

3907
03:20:40.638 --> 03:20:42.069
SAM: That's near the coast.

3908
03:20:42.069 --> 03:20:44.307
We've been there, it's really nice. There's a beach.

3909
03:20:44.307 --> 03:20:45.573
LIAM: Closer than we are now.

3910
03:20:45.573 --> 03:20:47.573
MATT: "I haven't seen a beach before."

3911
03:20:47.573 --> 03:20:48.481
LAURA: It's really pretty.

3912
03:20:48.481 --> 03:20:49.939
SAM: Yeah, except for the water.

3913
03:20:49.939 --> 03:20:51.231
LAURA: My mom lives there.

3914
03:20:51.231 --> 03:20:55.026
She would take pretty good care of you guys, I think.

3915
03:20:55.026 --> 03:20:57.950
TALIESIN and LAURA: Outside the Empire.

3916
03:20:57.950 --> 03:21:00.731
MATT: "Whenever we start to make that journey, I guess,

3917
03:21:00.731 --> 03:21:03.248
"sooner than later, I hope. I'm worried about him."

3918
03:21:03.248 --> 03:21:05.273
SAM: Of course.

3919
03:21:05.273 --> 03:21:06.566
MARISHA: Maybe we can find somebody

3920
03:21:06.566 --> 03:21:09.562
and arrange you an escort.

3921
03:21:09.562 --> 03:21:12.871
TALIESIN: Perhaps they'll be more

3922
03:21:12.871 --> 03:21:14.879
once they discover what we've done.

3923
03:21:14.879 --> 03:21:16.333
TRAVIS: And that we're staying.

3924
03:21:16.333 --> 03:21:19.533
TALIESIN: That they'll be more reasonable

3925
03:21:19.533 --> 03:21:21.669
if they know that we've

3926
03:21:21.669 --> 03:21:26.194
kept him away from the war entirely

3927
03:21:26.194 --> 03:21:28.542
and kept out of the situation.

3928
03:21:28.542 --> 03:21:30.498
LIAM: Don't you worry, we will get you to Alfield.

3929
03:21:30.498 --> 03:21:33.444
SAM: It might be an expensive journey, though.

3930
03:21:33.444 --> 03:21:35.051
LAURA: Well, Caleb can just get some paper

3931
03:21:35.051 --> 03:21:36.095
and then they'll figure out

3932
03:21:36.095 --> 03:21:38.513
how to just (poofs) somebody there.

3933
03:21:38.513 --> 03:21:40.796
TRAVIS: He's close.

3934
03:21:42.505 --> 03:21:44.873
Right, he was close?

3935
03:21:44.873 --> 03:21:46.803
SAM: For now, we just need to know

3936
03:21:46.803 --> 03:21:48.637
what we're doing in the morning.

3937
03:21:48.637 --> 03:21:50.649
TRAVIS: Yeah, so, I was going to say:

3938
03:21:50.649 --> 03:21:53.064
blacksmith, grocery shopping,

3939
03:21:53.064 --> 03:21:54.532
maybe talk about seeing if there's

3940
03:21:54.532 --> 03:21:58.036
a way to get him out of here and then

3941
03:21:58.036 --> 03:21:59.315
you guys were going to go check out

3942
03:21:59.315 --> 03:22:00.950
the library of stuff.

3943
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:02.422
SAM: What about Waccoh?

3944
03:22:02.422 --> 03:22:04.048
LAURA: Yeah, that's in the library of stuff.

3945
03:22:04.048 --> 03:22:05.356
MARISHA: Maybe we can all go together

3946
03:22:05.356 --> 03:22:07.528
to the library of stuff?

3947
03:22:07.528 --> 03:22:10.481
TALIESIN: We'll try and stick together for a while.

3948
03:22:10.481 --> 03:22:13.039
Things seem to go wrong when we split up.

3949
03:22:13.039 --> 03:22:15.420
MARISHA: We also tend to draw a lot of attention, though,

3950
03:22:15.420 --> 03:22:17.288
when we stick together.

3951
03:22:17.288 --> 03:22:18.727
LAURA: I wonder if with Yeza,

3952
03:22:18.727 --> 03:22:21.799
we should make him look like a goblin or something.

3953
03:22:21.799 --> 03:22:24.225
MATT: "How do we do that?"

3954
03:22:24.225 --> 03:22:25.363
LAURA: Because we're really powerful.

3955
03:22:25.363 --> 03:22:27.204
SAM: I think he's fine the way he is.

3956
03:22:27.204 --> 03:22:29.362
TRAVIS: Yeah, plus we got these.

3957
03:22:29.362 --> 03:22:30.637
SAM: But he doesn't have one.

3958
03:22:30.637 --> 03:22:31.985
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we got them.

3959
03:22:31.985 --> 03:22:33.714
MARISHA: By the way, I think we should be careful

3960
03:22:33.714 --> 03:22:36.617
about who we flaunt those to.

3961
03:22:36.617 --> 03:22:40.589
Might make us prime targets for some undesirables.

3962
03:22:40.589 --> 03:22:41.555
TALIESIN: You also just mimed it

3963
03:22:41.555 --> 03:22:42.388
because you're not wearing it

3964
03:22:42.388 --> 03:22:43.778
because it's currently in a bag.

3965
03:22:43.778 --> 03:22:46.798
LIAM: Technically, everything we do is mimed, Taliesin.

3966
03:22:46.798 --> 03:22:49.181
TALIESIN: That's fair. That's a very fair point.

3967
03:22:49.181 --> 03:22:50.956
LAURA: Just mimed it because they're all in the bag.

3968
03:22:50.956 --> 03:22:52.367
TRAVIS: I'm not worried about it.

3969
03:22:52.367 --> 03:22:53.942
If anybody comes up, I'm going to be like,

3970
03:22:53.942 --> 03:22:55.716
"Hero of the Dynasty."

3971
03:22:56.693 --> 03:22:57.968
"Hero of the Dynasty!"

3972
03:22:57.968 --> 03:23:00.375
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, it's convincing, you're right.

3973
03:23:00.375 --> 03:23:02.295
TRAVIS: Told you.

3974
03:23:02.295 --> 03:23:03.753
TALIESIN: I think the less lies

3975
03:23:03.753 --> 03:23:05.661
that we have to walk around with, the easier it'll be to--

3976
03:23:05.661 --> 03:23:07.261
MARISHA: I'm not saying lie.

3977
03:23:07.261 --> 03:23:09.845
TRAVIS: Hero of the Dynasty!

3978
03:23:09.845 --> 03:23:11.551
SAM: H-O-D!

3979
03:23:11.551 --> 03:23:15.349
MARISHA: We know that there are spies from the Empire here,

3980
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:16.907
like my boss!

3981
03:23:16.907 --> 03:23:17.753
LAURA: Shh!

3982
03:23:17.753 --> 03:23:18.936
MARISHA: Shut the fuck up!

3983
03:23:18.936 --> 03:23:20.602
LAURA: Why do you always shout this shit out?!

3984
03:23:20.602 --> 03:23:21.710
MARISHA: Why is it always me

3985
03:23:21.710 --> 03:23:24.214
that gets admonished and he just started

3986
03:23:24.214 --> 03:23:26.458
because he screamed we're Heroes of the Empire earlier!

3987
03:23:26.458 --> 03:23:29.265
LAURA: You're the one shouting it, Beau!

3988
03:23:29.265 --> 03:23:33.690
MARISHA: I'm sorry, my voice raises sometimes.

3989
03:23:33.690 --> 03:23:34.831
TALIESIN: We're not Heroes of the Empire.

3990
03:23:34.831 --> 03:23:35.664
LAURA: No, we're not.

3991
03:23:35.664 --> 03:23:36.555
TALIESIN: The Dynasty.

3992
03:23:36.555 --> 03:23:38.239
TRAVIS: Can your boss look like

3993
03:23:38.239 --> 03:23:42.238
other appearances or just the one?

3994
03:23:42.238 --> 03:23:44.755
MARISHA: I'm assuming she can mix it up.

3995
03:23:44.755 --> 03:23:48.629
TRAVIS: Well, I mean if we come across,

3996
03:23:48.629 --> 03:23:51.379
they'll reach out.

3997
03:23:51.379 --> 03:23:53.266
MARISHA: She's not the only one.

3998
03:23:53.266 --> 03:23:55.230
It's ignorant to think that there are not people here

3999
03:23:55.230 --> 03:24:00.230
looking to kill people exactly like us.

4000
03:24:00.824 --> 03:24:02.199
TALIESIN: It's probably a town full of

4001
03:24:02.199 --> 03:24:04.239
good people and bad people

4002
03:24:04.239 --> 03:24:05.734
MARISHA: There are good people and bad people everywhere.

4003
03:24:05.734 --> 03:24:07.233
LAURA: Exactly.

4004
03:24:07.233 --> 03:24:10.916
SAM: You guys wrap this up, my man is a little bit jittery.

4005
03:24:10.916 --> 03:24:12.099
I'm going to take him to bed.

4006
03:24:12.099 --> 03:24:14.202
TRAVIS: Oh, boy. We don't need to hear your sex code.

4007
03:24:14.202 --> 03:24:16.560
We will leave you to it!

4008
03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:17.968
SAM: He was in prison this morning--

4009
03:24:17.968 --> 03:24:20.110
TRAVIS: If you need extra towels or anything,

4010
03:24:20.110 --> 03:24:24.419
just let us know and we will unburden you.

4011
03:24:24.419 --> 03:24:26.184
LAURA: Do you need the bath, Yeza?

4012
03:24:26.184 --> 03:24:27.968
MATT: "I could definitely use a bath."

4013
03:24:27.968 --> 03:24:28.994
SAM: We'll arrange it.

4014
03:24:28.994 --> 03:24:33.179
TALIESIN: Let's turn in for the night.

4015
03:24:33.179 --> 03:24:34.259
MATT: All right.

4016
03:24:34.259 --> 03:24:38.264
As you all prepare yourselves for an evening's rest,

4017
03:24:38.264 --> 03:24:43.139
you having flashes of the imagery

4018
03:24:43.139 --> 03:24:46.117
that you received in your brief time

4019
03:24:46.117 --> 03:24:49.987
no longer within your mortal coil and the

4020
03:24:49.987 --> 03:24:53.712
unresolved tension between the accidental death

4021
03:24:53.712 --> 03:24:57.571
that found its way to you.

4022
03:24:57.571 --> 03:24:59.721
MARISHA: What?

4023
03:24:59.721 --> 03:25:00.909
MATT: When Nott killed him.

4024
03:25:00.909 --> 03:25:02.292
TALIESIN: I almost died.

4025
03:25:02.292 --> 03:25:03.642
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you.

4026
03:25:03.642 --> 03:25:05.409
SAM: Remember when I killed him?

4027
03:25:05.409 --> 03:25:07.407
TRAVIS: I thought we were on fucking lore alert, I was like.

4028
03:25:07.407 --> 03:25:10.160
Why is nobody registering this?

4029
03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:11.219
TALIESIN: I ain't dropping lore on you yet,

4030
03:25:11.219 --> 03:25:12.894
man, it's been a long game.

4031
03:25:12.894 --> 03:25:15.496
MATT: Yeah.

4032
03:25:15.496 --> 03:25:18.908
Anything you guys wish to do before you turn in?

4033
03:25:18.908 --> 03:25:21.336
SAM: I will use whatever means necessary

4034
03:25:21.336 --> 03:25:24.086
to completely black out the room.

4035
03:25:25.283 --> 03:25:26.536
MATT: Okay.

4036
03:25:26.536 --> 03:25:29.355
SAM: I'll tuck him into his bed

4037
03:25:29.355 --> 03:25:31.229
and I'll lie down on the floor next to him.

4038
03:25:31.229 --> 03:25:33.584
LAURA and MARISHA: Aw.

4039
03:25:33.584 --> 03:25:37.909
MATT: Okay, he passes straight out. He is exhausted.

4040
03:25:37.909 --> 03:25:41.688
You pass out on the floor.

4041
03:25:41.688 --> 03:25:46.352
Partway through the night, you hear some footfalls and

4042
03:25:46.352 --> 03:25:51.352
a hand grabs your arm.

4043
03:25:51.443 --> 03:25:54.815
A voice, familiar voice, goes, "Shh, it's okay.

4044
03:25:54.815 --> 03:25:56.998
"It's just me.

4045
03:25:56.998 --> 03:25:58.757
"Why are you on the floor?"

4046
03:25:58.757 --> 03:26:00.832
LAURA: Aw.

4047
03:26:00.832 --> 03:26:03.285
SAM: It weirdly feels better,

4048
03:26:03.285 --> 03:26:06.596
but I also wanted to give you your space.

4049
03:26:06.596 --> 03:26:07.977
MATT: "It's okay."

4050
03:26:07.977 --> 03:26:11.899
Since you do have darkvision as a goblin,

4051
03:26:11.899 --> 03:26:13.969
he pulls the blankets and pillows

4052
03:26:13.969 --> 03:26:15.845
and throws them on the floor.

4053
03:26:15.845 --> 03:26:18.905
He says, "I'll join you."

4054
03:26:18.905 --> 03:26:22.318
SAM: I give him all the pillows and blankets.

4055
03:26:22.318 --> 03:26:26.056
MATT: He passes back out again, but curled up next to you.

4056
03:26:26.056 --> 03:26:30.639
SAM: I'll stroke his little hair and watch him sleep.

4057
03:26:32.968 --> 03:26:34.984
MATT: As the rest of you find yourselves--

4058
03:26:34.984 --> 03:26:38.020
MARISHA: I grab Fjord before we leave the room.

4059
03:26:38.020 --> 03:26:38.942
MATT: That's what I'm checking,

4060
03:26:38.942 --> 03:26:40.591
I'm like what are you going to do before we close here?

4061
03:26:40.591 --> 03:26:43.791
MARISHA: Just pull him aside for a second.

4062
03:26:43.791 --> 03:26:45.313
You okay?
TRAVIS: Huh?

4063
03:26:45.313 --> 03:26:48.055
MARISHA: Are you okay?

4064
03:26:48.055 --> 03:26:50.277
You all right?
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm dandy.

4065
03:26:50.277 --> 03:26:52.744
Why you ask?

4066
03:26:54.200 --> 03:26:56.918
MARISHA: Just checking.

4067
03:26:56.918 --> 03:27:01.628
Still your first mate, Captain.

4068
03:27:01.628 --> 03:27:03.145
TRAVIS: Yeah, I appreciate that.

4069
03:27:03.145 --> 03:27:04.937
MARISHA: Sorry I was a little cagey,

4070
03:27:04.937 --> 03:27:08.213
past, you know, few hours.

4071
03:27:08.213 --> 03:27:10.379
SAM: Campaign.

4072
03:27:10.379 --> 03:27:14.462
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was about to say--

4073
03:27:14.462 --> 03:27:18.981
Not really sure what exact incident you are apologizing for

4074
03:27:18.981 --> 03:27:21.539
but it's all just Beau.

4075
03:27:21.539 --> 03:27:23.031
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

4076
03:27:23.031 --> 03:27:25.624
TRAVIS: How are you doing?

4077
03:27:25.624 --> 03:27:29.183
MARISHA: Good, I'm still processing.

4078
03:27:30.875 --> 03:27:35.256
Don't know what we just signed up for, but--

4079
03:27:35.256 --> 03:27:36.389
I don't know, I'm kind of excited

4080
03:27:36.389 --> 03:27:38.824
to see where it leads, I guess.

4081
03:27:38.824 --> 03:27:41.481
Yeah, I'm interested to explore

4082
03:27:41.481 --> 03:27:44.848
open waters, to be sure.

4083
03:27:46.217 --> 03:27:49.173
I am concerned.

4084
03:27:49.173 --> 03:27:53.790
Cautiously optimistic, but concerned.

4085
03:27:53.790 --> 03:27:55.971
We are definitely being watched.

4086
03:27:55.971 --> 03:27:57.111
MARISHA: Yeah.

4087
03:27:57.111 --> 03:28:01.190
TRAVIS: We are going to be fed every manner of story and lie

4088
03:28:01.190 --> 03:28:05.292
and propaganda that these people know and have,

4089
03:28:05.292 --> 03:28:10.217
and we are somehow supposed to divine the truth from BS.

4090
03:28:13.327 --> 03:28:15.610
MARISHA: Well.

4091
03:28:15.610 --> 03:28:16.535
I guess it's a good thing we have

4092
03:28:16.535 --> 03:28:19.269
some of the best detectives on our side.

4093
03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:22.261
TRAVIS: That's true, we do.

4094
03:28:22.261 --> 03:28:24.712
MARISHA: Anyway.

4095
03:28:24.712 --> 03:28:27.678
You got me if you need me.

4096
03:28:27.678 --> 03:28:30.894
I'm going to go pass out.

4097
03:28:30.894 --> 03:28:32.782
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

4098
03:28:32.782 --> 03:28:35.297
LIAM: When Fjord re-enters the room, Caleb is

4099
03:28:35.297 --> 03:28:38.364
pulling a silver wire around the room.

4100
03:28:38.364 --> 03:28:39.998
TALIESIN: Naked.

4101
03:28:39.998 --> 03:28:42.258
LIAM: Then later, as they're drifting--

4102
03:28:42.258 --> 03:28:43.425
TRAVIS: Inside the room?

4103
03:28:43.425 --> 03:28:44.491
LIAM: Yeah, inside the door.

4104
03:28:44.491 --> 03:28:46.411
Later, as they're drifting off,

4105
03:28:46.411 --> 03:28:49.044
he hears:

4106
03:28:49.044 --> 03:28:50.443
Fjord.

4107
03:28:50.443 --> 03:28:52.834
TRAVIS: (grunting)

4108
03:28:52.834 --> 03:28:57.231
LIAM: I appreciate you.

4109
03:28:57.231 --> 03:28:58.148
TRAVIS: You what?

4110
03:28:59.699 --> 03:29:03.616
LIAM: Sometimes you have to get a little bit crazy.

4111
03:29:06.557 --> 03:29:07.971
TRAVIS: What do you mean, right now?

4112
03:29:07.971 --> 03:29:12.971
LIAM: Uh. No, you said that to me once.

4113
03:29:13.273 --> 03:29:14.106
TRAVIS: Oh.

4114
03:29:14.106 --> 03:29:14.947
LIAM: It was a callback.

4115
03:29:14.947 --> 03:29:16.335
TRAVIS: Right, sorry, yeah.

4116
03:29:16.335 --> 03:29:18.526
I just was almost asleep.

4117
03:29:18.526 --> 03:29:20.826
LIAM: Anyway.

4118
03:29:20.826 --> 03:29:22.234
Glad we're not dead.

4119
03:29:22.234 --> 03:29:24.051
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

4120
03:29:24.051 --> 03:29:28.301
LIAM: This went worse than I imagined it. Good night.

4121
03:29:29.565 --> 03:29:34.146
TRAVIS: Hey, I didn't say it.

4122
03:29:34.146 --> 03:29:39.121
It took a brass pair to do what you did, so

4123
03:29:40.405 --> 03:29:44.822
thanks for not, you know, getting us killed, I guess.

4124
03:29:46.097 --> 03:29:47.763
LIAM: Well, when I see my friends

4125
03:29:47.763 --> 03:29:49.988
on the verge of possible death

4126
03:29:49.988 --> 03:29:54.236
I'm not going to stand by and do nothing.

4127
03:29:54.236 --> 03:29:56.074
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4128
03:29:56.074 --> 03:29:59.324
I'm going to go to sleep now.

4129
03:30:01.286 --> 03:30:03.339
LIAM: I stay awake in bed for another 30 minutes

4130
03:30:03.339 --> 03:30:07.231
and scratch Frumpkin's neck and then pass out.

4131
03:30:07.231 --> 03:30:09.380
MATT: Okay.

4132
03:30:09.380 --> 03:30:10.739
Anyone else?

4133
03:30:10.739 --> 03:30:13.565
LAURA: What do you think they're doing right now?

4134
03:30:13.565 --> 03:30:15.881
MARISHA: Yeza and Vess, Veth? Veth, right?

4135
03:30:15.881 --> 03:30:18.352
LAURA: Yeah, Veth. That's what she was named.

4136
03:30:18.352 --> 03:30:21.773
MARISHA: I don't know, Yeza looked pretty fucked up, man.

4137
03:30:21.773 --> 03:30:23.406
LAURA: Yeah, he ate a lot, too.

4138
03:30:23.406 --> 03:30:25.289
MARISHA: Yeah, he did. I bet he barfed.

4139
03:30:25.289 --> 03:30:26.309
LAURA: Probably.

4140
03:30:26.309 --> 03:30:27.142
MARISHA: Yeah.

4141
03:30:27.142 --> 03:30:30.150
LAURA: They probably started to bone and then he threw up.

4142
03:30:30.150 --> 03:30:30.983
Oh no!

4143
03:30:30.983 --> 03:30:32.750
MARISHA: I bet that's right.

4144
03:30:32.750 --> 03:30:34.350
Yeah, that sounds very probable.

4145
03:30:34.350 --> 03:30:35.291
LAURA: We'll ask in the morning.

4146
03:30:35.291 --> 03:30:36.124
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

4147
03:30:36.124 --> 03:30:37.051
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4148
03:30:37.051 --> 03:30:38.552
But not in a way that's like, "Did you throw up

4149
03:30:38.552 --> 03:30:40.964
"because she is a goblin?" because that's not cool.

4150
03:30:40.964 --> 03:30:41.869
MARISHA: Oh no!

4151
03:30:41.869 --> 03:30:43.919
LAURA: Yeah, no, just because he ate too much.

4152
03:30:43.919 --> 03:30:44.902
MARISHA: I was proud of him.

4153
03:30:44.902 --> 03:30:47.577
LAURA: Me, too. He seemed like he really, really loved her.

4154
03:30:47.577 --> 03:30:49.696
MARISHA: He's a good guy.

4155
03:30:49.696 --> 03:30:52.213
I would've beaten his ass if he was

4156
03:30:52.213 --> 03:30:54.828
a piece of shit about it.

4157
03:30:54.828 --> 03:30:58.494
LAURA: You know, it's funny because, like,

4158
03:30:58.494 --> 03:31:02.893
you know, we read all these books and stuff and

4159
03:31:02.893 --> 03:31:06.706
that's not at all the way love is described

4160
03:31:06.706 --> 03:31:09.448
in the books that we read.

4161
03:31:09.448 --> 03:31:13.340
MARISHA: You mean the porn books that we read?

4162
03:31:13.340 --> 03:31:14.950
Those?

4163
03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:17.091
LAURA: Well, are they like porn, though,

4164
03:31:17.091 --> 03:31:18.830
or are they just like the way

4165
03:31:18.830 --> 03:31:21.035
relationships are for real, though?

4166
03:31:21.035 --> 03:31:22.560
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

4167
03:31:23.568 --> 03:31:26.115
MARISHA: Well.

4168
03:31:26.115 --> 03:31:28.502
(groans)

4169
03:31:28.502 --> 03:31:30.238
LAURA: It's okay, we don't have to talk about this tonight.

4170
03:31:30.238 --> 03:31:32.526
I know everything already, it doesn't matter.

4171
03:31:32.526 --> 03:31:34.191
And I turn over and go to bed.

4172
03:31:34.191 --> 03:31:38.691
(laughter)

4173
03:31:42.158 --> 03:31:47.158
MARISHA: Jester learned about romance from porn, oh no!

4174
03:31:47.282 --> 03:31:50.699
TALIESIN: Uh-oh, someone ordered a pizza.

4175
03:31:51.788 --> 03:31:54.846
TRAVIS: "I'm here to fix your pool." "I don't have a pool."

4176
03:31:54.846 --> 03:31:57.939
(laughter)

4177
03:31:57.939 --> 03:32:00.348
LIAM: "Arcane delivery."

4178
03:32:04.920 --> 03:32:06.780
MATT: (chuckles)

4179
03:32:06.780 --> 03:32:07.655
In the night.

4180
03:32:07.655 --> 03:32:09.608
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4181
03:32:09.608 --> 03:32:13.275
MATT: You hear Yasha's voice in the dark go,

4182
03:32:15.299 --> 03:32:17.665
"You--

4183
03:32:17.665 --> 03:32:20.370
"are you okay?"

4184
03:32:20.370 --> 03:32:22.320
TALIESIN: Well,

4185
03:32:23.927 --> 03:32:26.869
yeah, I'm--

4186
03:32:28.782 --> 03:32:32.400
certainly real now, isn't it?

4187
03:32:32.400 --> 03:32:33.233
MATT: "Yeah."

4188
03:32:35.175 --> 03:32:36.866
TALIESIN: I--

4189
03:32:40.060 --> 03:32:44.446
I will admit, I'm a little nervous.

4190
03:32:44.446 --> 03:32:49.055
Miss Yasha, I feel,

4191
03:32:50.730 --> 03:32:55.730
I thought I understood a sense of purpose and

4192
03:32:56.091 --> 03:33:01.091
I thought I knew what I was heading for and now I'm so sure.

4193
03:33:04.585 --> 03:33:09.252
I'm worried that might be a little dangerous, but I can,

4194
03:33:13.528 --> 03:33:18.361
that moment when I was under, I, (sighs),

4195
03:33:23.076 --> 03:33:27.574
I'm so grateful for it.

4196
03:33:27.574 --> 03:33:32.574
You think that's...

4197
03:33:32.975 --> 03:33:37.751
you think that's a little dangerous?

4198
03:33:37.751 --> 03:33:42.751
MATT: "Sometimes tragedy gives perspective."

4199
03:33:42.850 --> 03:33:45.516
TALIESIN: I...

4200
03:33:47.464 --> 03:33:50.331
I believe in destiny,

4201
03:33:50.331 --> 03:33:53.307
and I believe that we are called upon

4202
03:33:53.307 --> 03:33:58.099
to do great work sometimes over small work sometimes and

4203
03:34:03.241 --> 03:34:06.487
there is something special with these people and with you

4204
03:34:06.487 --> 03:34:08.837
and with us.

4205
03:34:08.837 --> 03:34:13.799
I'm going to try to remind them

4206
03:34:14.929 --> 03:34:19.912
that it's important to honor that

4207
03:34:21.685 --> 03:34:25.277
and not just...

4208
03:34:27.922 --> 03:34:29.042
I think there's a great version

4209
03:34:29.042 --> 03:34:33.525
of all these people and of you.

4210
03:34:37.131 --> 03:34:40.263
MATT: "I hope so."

4211
03:34:40.263 --> 03:34:43.600
TALIESIN: Hopefully I won't get everybody else killed too.

4212
03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:48.364
MATT: "Hopefully we won't get you killed either, not again."

4213
03:34:48.364 --> 03:34:53.262
TALIESIN: Think I need to talk to the Wildmother again soon.

4214
03:34:53.262 --> 03:34:58.195
MATT: "I think I have to talk to my own

4215
03:34:58.195 --> 03:35:01.492
"interested party, as well."

4216
03:35:01.492 --> 03:35:05.408
TALIESIN: I would very much like to know what they say.

4217
03:35:06.564 --> 03:35:10.989
MATT: "Me too.

4218
03:35:10.989 --> 03:35:13.353
"Anyway, good night."

4219
03:35:13.353 --> 03:35:18.102
TALIESIN: Thank you for taking care of these people with me.

4220
03:35:18.102 --> 03:35:20.552
MATT: "Just paying forward how

4221
03:35:20.552 --> 03:35:23.493
"one of them once took care of me."

4222
03:35:23.493 --> 03:35:24.543
TALIESIN: Aren't we all?

4223
03:35:24.543 --> 03:35:28.843
MATT: "In his honor.

4224
03:35:28.843 --> 03:35:29.724
"Good night."

4225
03:35:29.724 --> 03:35:32.780
TALIESIN: Good night. (snoring)

4226
03:35:32.780 --> 03:35:34.991
TRAVIS: No!

4227
03:35:34.991 --> 03:35:36.137
MATT: You hear the shuffling of a pillow

4228
03:35:36.137 --> 03:35:39.777
being pushed over Yasha's ears.

4229
03:35:39.777 --> 03:35:41.652
LIAM: (mooing)

4230
03:35:41.652 --> 03:35:44.226
MATT: With that, you all rest for the night

4231
03:35:44.226 --> 03:35:47.943
after a chaotic arrival in Rosohna.

4232
03:35:47.943 --> 03:35:52.342
The core of the Kryn Dynasty.

4233
03:35:52.342 --> 03:35:53.791
You also hit level nine.

4234
03:35:53.791 --> 03:35:56.019
(cheering)

4235
03:35:56.019 --> 03:35:59.564
We'll go ahead and roll hit points real fast here.

4236
03:35:59.564 --> 03:36:00.397
SAM: Dear god.

4237
03:36:00.397 --> 03:36:01.871
LIAM: (yelling)

4238
03:36:01.871 --> 03:36:04.273
Oh, it fell on the floor.

4239
03:36:04.273 --> 03:36:05.530
It's so important for me, guys.

4240
03:36:05.530 --> 03:36:06.677
TALIESIN: So you roll your hit die, right?

4241
03:36:06.677 --> 03:36:07.510
MATT: Yeah.

4242
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:09.018
LIAM: It's a six on the floor, can I take it?

4243
03:36:09.018 --> 03:36:09.851
MATT: No.

4244
03:36:09.851 --> 03:36:11.287
LIAM: Goddamn it!

4245
03:36:11.287 --> 03:36:14.279
It's a six in the board!

4246
03:36:14.279 --> 03:36:16.588
TALIESIN: I got a five!

4247
03:36:16.588 --> 03:36:18.329
MARISHA: I got a five too, not too bad.

4248
03:36:18.329 --> 03:36:19.271
TRAVIS: Two.

4249
03:36:19.271 --> 03:36:21.991
MATT: Two, wah wah.

4250
03:36:21.991 --> 03:36:22.824
LIAM: Yes!

4251
03:36:22.824 --> 03:36:23.797
SAM: Fuck!

4252
03:36:23.797 --> 03:36:25.119
MATT: Seven.

4253
03:36:25.119 --> 03:36:26.709
You're so angry when you roll well!

4254
03:36:26.709 --> 03:36:27.542
LAURA: Oh, I rolled a one.

4255
03:36:27.542 --> 03:36:29.752
MATT: Reroll ones, remember?

4256
03:36:29.752 --> 03:36:31.452
LAURA: A five!

4257
03:36:31.452 --> 03:36:33.151
TRAVIS: And we add--?

4258
03:36:33.151 --> 03:36:34.612
MATT: I believe your modifier already gets added,

4259
03:36:34.612 --> 03:36:36.052
so just put the number you rolled.

4260
03:36:36.052 --> 03:36:37.687
TALIESIN: You change your rolled HP,

4261
03:36:37.687 --> 03:36:38.670
you add it to your roll of your HP.

4262
03:36:38.670 --> 03:36:41.012
LAURA: Yeah, you add it to your rolled HP.

4263
03:36:41.012 --> 03:36:45.549
LIAM: Guys, I'm all of 57 hit points.

4264
03:36:45.549 --> 03:36:48.974
TALIESIN: Immortal, immortal!

4265
03:36:50.250 --> 03:36:53.667
MATT: I think for some of you guys, that's--

4266
03:36:55.232 --> 03:36:56.871
I think it's 5th-level spells, right?

4267
03:36:56.871 --> 03:36:57.796
LAURA: Yeah.

4268
03:36:57.796 --> 03:36:58.870
MATT: Oh, man.

4269
03:36:58.870 --> 03:37:00.978
SAM: That's Bigby's Hand shit!

4270
03:37:00.978 --> 03:37:01.811
MATT: Man.

4271
03:37:01.811 --> 03:37:03.094
TALIESIN: I can do some crazy stuff now.

4272
03:37:03.094 --> 03:37:04.761
LAURA: Yeah, there's some stuff.

4273
03:37:04.761 --> 03:37:07.111
TALIESIN: I've got Mass Healing Word now.

4274
03:37:07.111 --> 03:37:08.236
MATT: That's going to be fun.

4275
03:37:08.236 --> 03:37:09.069
LAURA: I do too, but--

4276
03:37:09.069 --> 03:37:09.902
TALIESIN: Whole party goes down,

4277
03:37:09.902 --> 03:37:11.085
(snaps) whole party comes back up

4278
03:37:11.085 --> 03:37:12.564
as long as you guys don't wander

4279
03:37:12.564 --> 03:37:14.556
60 feet in front of everybody.

4280
03:37:14.556 --> 03:37:15.907
LIAM: Are you about to sunset us for the night?

4281
03:37:15.907 --> 03:37:17.341
MATT: I am.

4282
03:37:17.341 --> 03:37:19.645
LIAM: Can I do one thing in the morning?

4283
03:37:19.645 --> 03:37:20.564
MATT: Sure.

4284
03:37:20.564 --> 03:37:21.971
LIAM: It's just a talk, just a conversation.

4285
03:37:21.971 --> 03:37:25.203
MATT: Okay, and then we'll kick it off there next week.

4286
03:37:25.203 --> 03:37:28.538
Does everyone finish their input?

4287
03:37:28.538 --> 03:37:29.696
You good, you good?

4288
03:37:29.696 --> 03:37:30.529
SAM: Yeah, I'm good.

4289
03:37:30.529 --> 03:37:31.810
MATT: You good?

4290
03:37:31.810 --> 03:37:32.740
MARISHA: I'm good, I think.

4291
03:37:32.740 --> 03:37:34.525
MATT: Good? All right.

4292
03:37:34.525 --> 03:37:37.451
We'll get Ashley's soon enough.

4293
03:37:37.451 --> 03:37:39.676
So.

4294
03:37:39.676 --> 03:37:42.287
Consciousness comes to you.

4295
03:37:42.287 --> 03:37:45.704
You recognize the morning and you feel it in your bones,

4296
03:37:45.704 --> 03:37:47.853
but it's strange to look out the

4297
03:37:47.853 --> 03:37:52.853
small, glass window and see it's still night.

4298
03:37:52.959 --> 03:37:56.152
But you feel it's morning.

4299
03:37:56.152 --> 03:37:58.539
And it's restful.

4300
03:37:58.539 --> 03:38:00.541
What would you like to do?

4301
03:38:00.541 --> 03:38:03.646
LIAM: I quietly leave the room

4302
03:38:03.646 --> 03:38:06.930
and I go to Jester and Beauregard's room

4303
03:38:06.930 --> 03:38:08.886
and I gently knock on the door.

4304
03:38:08.886 --> 03:38:11.136
(knocking)

4305
03:38:12.392 --> 03:38:15.691
LAURA: Who is it?

4306
03:38:15.691 --> 03:38:19.686
LIAM: It is Caleb.

4307
03:38:19.686 --> 03:38:22.058
I'm sorry, both of you, Beauregard,

4308
03:38:22.058 --> 03:38:23.762
I need to ask your advice on something.

4309
03:38:23.762 --> 03:38:27.772
Could you please, could I borrow you for a moment?

4310
03:38:27.772 --> 03:38:29.124
Is she awake?

4311
03:38:29.124 --> 03:38:30.479
MARISHA: Yeah.

4312
03:38:30.479 --> 03:38:32.745
LAURA: She's sleeping still.

4313
03:38:32.745 --> 03:38:36.437
MARISHA: I'm sleeping, I'm coming out.

4314
03:38:36.437 --> 03:38:37.328
I go out.

4315
03:38:37.328 --> 03:38:38.695
LIAM: Please be dressed.

4316
03:38:38.695 --> 03:38:39.611
LAURA: She's naked.

4317
03:38:39.611 --> 03:38:41.885
LIAM: No.

4318
03:38:41.885 --> 03:38:42.993
MARISHA: I go out.

4319
03:38:42.993 --> 03:38:43.826
LIAM: Are you naked?

4320
03:38:43.826 --> 03:38:44.659
MARISHA: No.

4321
03:38:44.659 --> 03:38:45.492
LIAM: Okay, come with me, please.

4322
03:38:45.492 --> 03:38:48.943
MARISHA: You don't get that privilege.

4323
03:38:48.943 --> 03:38:53.597
LIAM: I lead downstairs and find it's like crack of dawn

4324
03:38:53.597 --> 03:38:56.299
kind of thing here, even though there's no sun, yeah?

4325
03:38:56.299 --> 03:38:58.976
MATT: It would be like because you guys went to sleep

4326
03:38:58.976 --> 03:39:00.879
not too late in the evening, be close to like

4327
03:39:00.879 --> 03:39:02.001
six or seven in the morning.

4328
03:39:02.001 --> 03:39:03.572
LIAM: Is the dining area deserted at this point?

4329
03:39:03.572 --> 03:39:07.906
MATT: It's not deserted, but there's two drow

4330
03:39:07.906 --> 03:39:09.585
that are currently there.

4331
03:39:09.585 --> 03:39:11.426
One of them looks like they maybe have passed out

4332
03:39:11.426 --> 03:39:14.809
at the table, the other is currently

4333
03:39:14.809 --> 03:39:18.108
sitting and finishing an early breakfast.

4334
03:39:18.108 --> 03:39:19.954
LIAM: I lead Beauregard to the opposite,

4335
03:39:19.954 --> 03:39:21.775
as far as I can get from these two.

4336
03:39:21.775 --> 03:39:24.030
MATT: Okay, easy enough to do.

4337
03:39:24.030 --> 03:39:25.851
LIAM: Listen to me.

4338
03:39:25.851 --> 03:39:27.818
MARISHA: Yo, why did you get me up so early?

4339
03:39:27.818 --> 03:39:29.016
LIAM: Are you awake?

4340
03:39:29.016 --> 03:39:29.849
MARISHA: Yes, what?

4341
03:39:29.849 --> 03:39:30.982
LIAM: Keep your voice down.

4342
03:39:30.982 --> 03:39:34.066
MARISHA: Okay, what?!

4343
03:39:37.380 --> 03:39:39.625
You all right?

4344
03:39:39.625 --> 03:39:41.760
LIAM: Yes!

4345
03:39:41.760 --> 03:39:46.433
But I would be better--

4346
03:39:46.433 --> 03:39:51.425
I need you to trust me.

4347
03:39:53.555 --> 03:39:56.805
I need you to be my friend.

4348
03:40:00.113 --> 03:40:02.247
I can't believe that I am saying those words,

4349
03:40:02.247 --> 03:40:07.038
but I need you to be my friend.

4350
03:40:07.038 --> 03:40:09.348
Yeah, I've probably said some crazy things to you.

4351
03:40:09.348 --> 03:40:11.745
I have railed against the elements.

4352
03:40:11.745 --> 03:40:16.412
But I have also said that I wanted to murder a man.

4353
03:40:16.412 --> 03:40:21.022
That falls in line with things that Dairon and you want.

4354
03:40:21.022 --> 03:40:24.060
I just put everything on the line, my own survival,

4355
03:40:24.060 --> 03:40:28.171
all of our survival on the line

4356
03:40:28.171 --> 03:40:31.052
because I wanted to see you live

4357
03:40:31.052 --> 03:40:35.485
and all of our friends live.

4358
03:40:36.786 --> 03:40:39.543
A week ago.

4359
03:40:39.543 --> 03:40:41.906
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4360
03:40:41.906 --> 03:40:46.906
LIAM: Killing that man seemed impossible to me.

4361
03:40:47.221 --> 03:40:51.060
And now it does not.

4362
03:40:51.060 --> 03:40:53.925
LIAM: You don't have to convince me of anything, Caleb.

4363
03:40:53.925 --> 03:40:56.163
I've been your friend this whole time.

4364
03:40:56.163 --> 03:40:59.580
LIAM: Well, last night, it seemed like I did.

4365
03:41:01.549 --> 03:41:03.591
MARISHA: It's whether you believe it

4366
03:41:03.591 --> 03:41:06.799
that's always been a question mark to me.

4367
03:41:06.799 --> 03:41:10.477
Do you believe I'm your friend?

4368
03:41:10.477 --> 03:41:14.097
That's always been the problem, man.

4369
03:41:14.097 --> 03:41:15.613
I care for you a lot and I've told you that

4370
03:41:15.613 --> 03:41:18.552
on more than one occasion.

4371
03:41:18.552 --> 03:41:23.294
And I'm not sure what it's met with.

4372
03:41:23.294 --> 03:41:28.294
So do you trust me? Do you trust the rest of us?

4373
03:41:28.393 --> 03:41:33.393
Or are we just cogs in your overall grand plan?

4374
03:41:33.447 --> 03:41:36.624
Because that would hurt.

4375
03:41:36.624 --> 03:41:40.703
That would hurt real bad, man, if that was the case.

4376
03:41:40.703 --> 03:41:43.058
LIAM: I think that I have spent so long like this

4377
03:41:43.058 --> 03:41:47.786
that it is hard, maybe, for you to tell

4378
03:41:47.786 --> 03:41:52.695
that I care for you.

4379
03:41:55.819 --> 03:41:58.519
I'm sorry for anything that I have done in the past

4380
03:41:58.519 --> 03:42:01.902
that has earned your distrust.

4381
03:42:01.902 --> 03:42:05.860
MARISHA: Hey, look at me.

4382
03:42:08.366 --> 03:42:11.981
I'll trust you.

4383
03:42:11.981 --> 03:42:15.023
If you do me a favor.

4384
03:42:15.023 --> 03:42:18.341
Start trusting yourself.

4385
03:42:18.341 --> 03:42:21.974
Just a little bit.

4386
03:42:24.002 --> 03:42:27.243
LIAM: Getting there.

4387
03:42:28.970 --> 03:42:31.470
Anyway, I respect you greatly.

4388
03:42:33.311 --> 03:42:36.589
Thank you for your time.

4389
03:42:36.589 --> 03:42:38.563
MARISHA: You don't have to thank me for my time

4390
03:42:38.563 --> 03:42:43.497
like you're a social worker. And I give a him a hug.

4391
03:42:47.232 --> 03:42:50.190
Look, you're next to me. We can do it in real life.

4392
03:42:50.190 --> 03:42:52.440
(laughter)

4393
03:42:57.390 --> 03:42:59.790
LIAM: <i>Danke.</i>

4394
03:43:06.654 --> 03:43:09.745
MARISHA: Yeah, you too.

4395
03:43:11.745 --> 03:43:14.495
LIAM: We can do some good, all of us.

4396
03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:19.177
We can do some good.

4397
03:43:21.648 --> 03:43:23.948
MARISHA: I think that's the best retribution

4398
03:43:23.948 --> 03:43:26.841
for Caleb Widogast.

4399
03:43:26.841 --> 03:43:31.841
Two pieces of shit like us doing some good?

4400
03:43:33.655 --> 03:43:35.046
LIAM: Holla!

4401
03:43:35.046 --> 03:43:37.429
MARISHA: No, don't, don't!

4402
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:39.346
MATT: And on that note.

4403
03:43:40.753 --> 03:43:44.177
SAM: The worst. The literal worst.

4404
03:43:44.177 --> 03:43:46.157
MATT: It's the best.

4405
03:43:46.157 --> 03:43:47.349
LIAM: What's that, shark man?

4406
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:49.604
SAM: Hey!

4407
03:43:49.604 --> 03:43:51.385
MATT: I thought we had finally killed him off.

4408
03:43:51.385 --> 03:43:52.915
All right.

4409
03:43:52.915 --> 03:43:55.766
We'll pick this up next week.

4410
03:43:55.766 --> 03:43:57.455
Oh, man, this is good.

4411
03:43:57.455 --> 03:44:00.938
I'm excited.

4412
03:44:00.938 --> 03:44:03.537
Once again, holy shit.

4413
03:44:03.537 --> 03:44:06.037
LIAM: Holy shit.

4414
03:44:07.917 --> 03:44:10.057
SAM: Thank you, Critters.

4415
03:44:10.057 --> 03:44:11.931
We get to make ten episodes.

4416
03:44:11.931 --> 03:44:15.066
LAURA: Ten episodes, you guys!

4417
03:44:15.066 --> 03:44:16.752
LIAM: Ten motherfucking episodes!

4418
03:44:16.752 --> 03:44:21.305
MATT: Eight episodes through the Briarwood arc. Ahh!

4419
03:44:21.305 --> 03:44:23.117
SAM: And an Ashley Johnson one shot.

4420
03:44:23.117 --> 03:44:25.015
MATT: Yeah!

4421
03:44:25.015 --> 03:44:27.358
SAM: What will it be?

4422
03:44:27.358 --> 03:44:30.512
What will it be?

4423
03:44:30.512 --> 03:44:32.003
MATT: Yeah, this is crazy.

4424
03:44:32.003 --> 03:44:33.344
LIAM: A Blindspot game.

4425
03:44:33.344 --> 03:44:34.569
TALIESIN: I was going to say: a mysterious woman

4426
03:44:34.569 --> 03:44:35.402
covered in tattoos.

4427
03:44:35.402 --> 03:44:37.607
SAM: She'll be on Skype.

4428
03:44:37.607 --> 03:44:38.515
MATT: No.

4429
03:44:38.515 --> 03:44:40.533
TALIESIN: Skype DM.

4430
03:44:40.533 --> 03:44:42.709
MATT: Don't we get her back next week?

4431
03:44:42.709 --> 03:44:43.542
LIAM and MATT: We think so.

4432
03:44:43.542 --> 03:44:44.608
MATT: Fingers crossed.

4433
03:44:44.608 --> 03:44:46.874
TALIESIN: Let's not make any promises we can't keep.

4434
03:44:46.874 --> 03:44:49.782
MATT: We're getting Ashley back soon and I'm super excited.

4435
03:44:49.782 --> 03:44:52.085
But anyway.

4436
03:44:52.085 --> 03:44:54.341
Have a wonderful night, thank you so much.

4437
03:44:54.341 --> 03:44:57.482
We love you very much and is it Thursday yet?

4438
03:44:57.482 --> 03:44:59.631
Good night, guys!

4439
03:44:59.631 --> 03:45:04.631

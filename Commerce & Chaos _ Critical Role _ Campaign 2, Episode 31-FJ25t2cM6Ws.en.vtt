00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.071
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:05.672
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:10.690
TRAVIS: Yeah, we play Dungeons &amp; Dragons! Sorry.
I'm excited.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.886
MATT: Laura will be joining us shortly. She's
finishing baby stuff in the other room. But in the

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:19.575
meantime, we're here to get through our
announcements for the evening. First and foremost,

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:27.569
we have our fantastic friends and glorious sponsor
through campaign two thus far, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.927
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:38.821
SAM: Yesterday, guys, was D&amp;D Beyond's first one--
first one-year anniversary. Take two. Hey guys,

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:44.465
yesterday was D&amp;D Beyond's one-year anniversary.
Wish them a happy birthday on their Facebook and

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.023
Twitter pages.

00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:47.848
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Happy birthday.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:53.822
SAM: Or just right there. Also, as a reminder, D&amp;D
Beyond streams their weekly show called &amp; Beyond

00:00:53.822 --> 00:01:03.460
every Wednesday on twitch.tv/dndbeyond. It's not--
take two. I was going to say it's <i>not</i> great

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.417
conversations, but no. Pick up. It's <i>got</i> great
conversations with special guests like Matt Mercer

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:18.587
and Mike Mearls, and other guests with M.M. names.
That's the whole announcement, but I recently went

00:01:18.587 --> 00:01:26.548
to Virginia, so I got inspired to write a country
song for D&amp;D Beyond.

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:27.882
TRAVIS: Is that what that hat is?

00:01:27.882 --> 00:01:30.549
MARISHA: That hat has puka shells on it.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.546
SAM: I was going to learn this on the guitar, but
then I realized I don't really play guitar. All

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:44.783
right, here's my country song for D&amp;D Beyond.
(singing) My baby left me on the fourth of July, I

00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:46.747
cri-- Take two.

00:01:46.747 --> 00:01:51.951
(laughter)

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:53.304
LAURA: Okay, I'm ready.

00:01:53.304 --> 00:02:00.979
SAM: Settle. (singing) My baby left me on the
fourth of July. I cried red, white, and blue. Got

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.816
in my Chevy, popped open a Coors, and moseyed on
over to you. Opened the trailer, played some

00:02:07.816 --> 00:02:14.839
Johnny Cash, kicked off my cowboy boots, and sat.
Got my character sheet and my daddy's dice,

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:27.498
because Exandria's where it's at. D&amp;D Beyond, be
my girl tonight. Roll me close, crit me tight. I

00:02:27.498 --> 00:02:33.635
got a pickup, a 12-gauge, an American flag, but
it's you that makes me feel all right. D&amp;D

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:35.010
Beyond--

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.651
MARISHA: (singing) D&amp;D Beyond.

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:44.184
SAM: (singing) Be my girl tonight. There's another
verse! I've trucked across the heartland, from

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:52.789
Dallas to Memphis and back. But Emon's the place I
miss the most, where I want to hang my hat. So,

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:59.863
darling, call the Piggly Wiggly, and tell them
you're gonna be late. Turn off your phone because

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:09.336
your cowboy's home. Get ready for an all-night
date. D&amp;D Beyond, be my girl tonight. Roll me

00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:15.842
close, crit me tight. I got some illegal
fireworks, a smokehouse, a new tractor, a hunting

00:03:15.842 --> 00:03:20.758
dog, my mama's Bible, some Frito pie, NASCAR
tickets, a deer license, some new tires, a handle

00:03:20.758 --> 00:03:29.601
of Southern Comfort, but it's you that makes me
feel all right. D&amp;D Beyond, be my girl tonight.

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:31.789
MATT: Aw, thank you, Sam.

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:36.226
SAM: Those are all official Southern things.

00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:39.566
TRAVIS: I'm not sure if we'll animate that one,
but--

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:44.931
SAM: Give it time!

00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:49.903
MATT: If we've taken anything from that, we now
have the mental image of a country Sam enjoying an

00:03:49.903 --> 00:03:52.472
all-night date with his D&amp;D Beyond.

00:03:52.472 --> 00:03:57.210
LAURA: You and your computer, all night.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.441
MATT: Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for your sponsorship
and allowing such magical moments like this to

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.796
happen.

00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:06.017
LIAM: "What are you doing in there, Sam?" "I'm
just looking at my spells!"

00:04:06.017 --> 00:04:12.657
MATT: We also have, for those who haven't seen it
yet or haven't had the opportunity, Marisha's

00:04:12.657 --> 00:04:20.331
Honey Heist 2: Electric Beargaloo VOD is available
on YouTube at youtube.com/criticalrole, so you can

00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:23.250
go check it out there for free any time you want!
It's there, it's ready to go.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.449
TRAVIS: You were a bunch of crackheads.
Crackheads.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.581
MATT: It was nuts. It was so much fun.

00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:29.054
MARISHA: We were pretty loopy.

00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:34.729
MATT: On that same regard, for the time being, our
limited-run Electric Beargaloo tee is available

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:43.832
right now in the store, for a limited time.
Fantastic, beary awesome portrait art by Joana

00:04:43.832 --> 00:04:49.864
Carvalho, who did a great job with it. You can
check it out at shop.critrole.com.

00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:55.708
LAURA: Who was touching my dice? Why were they out
already when I got here? Samuel, what did you do?

00:04:55.708 --> 00:05:04.299
SAM: I may have helped set up for you, being a
caring parent. Don't worry, though, I only touched

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:06.669
the ones that you wouldn't have used anyway.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.151
LAURA: Great.

00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:11.688
MATT: Speaking of which, Laura, how's that merch
coming?

00:05:11.688 --> 00:05:19.198
LAURA: Hey, we got those Electric Beargaloo
shirts! You guys, did you know we have a bunch of

00:05:19.198 --> 00:05:20.699
new items in our shop?

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.029
MARISHA and TALIESIN: What?

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:27.816
LAURA: There's a retro tee. There's a Mighty Nein
Tee. That one has been altered by Marisha Ray, but

00:05:27.816 --> 00:05:29.266
you can alter your own at home.

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:30.900
MARISHA: Sleeves are bullshit!

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.485
LAURA: That's right. We've got-- we don't have
that one in store right now. But we have our other

00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:41.592
shirts. The Nott Detective Agency, case closed.

00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:43.252
SAM: You've got one job.

00:05:43.252 --> 00:05:46.716
LAURA: We have hats that are sold out that'll be
back some time. Pins.

00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:48.171
MARISHA: Everyone loved the dad hats.

00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:49.870
LAURA: The dad hats are awesome!

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.625
SAM: Why are they dad hats?

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:53.157
LAURA: Well, they're called dad hat.

00:05:53.157 --> 00:05:54.376
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:05:54.376 --> 00:05:56.964
LAURA: But I wore my dad hat and it looks great on
a girl, too.

00:05:56.964 --> 00:05:58.698
MARISHA: I was wearing it today when I was
working.

00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:02.905
LAURA: It's metallic thread. That'll be back. I
like how we're advertising our hat that's not in

00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:09.456
stock right now, but there's other things. Go
check it out at our shop: shop.critrole.com. I

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:11.291
know that address by heart!

00:06:11.291 --> 00:06:13.691
MATT: Thank you, Laura. Welcome back to the
table.

00:06:13.691 --> 00:06:15.539
TRAVIS: Polished, professional.

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.423
MARISHA: It's like riding a bike.

00:06:17.423 --> 00:06:19.546
LAURA: Someday I'll get to Sam Riegel levels.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.112
SAM: (singing) D&amp;D Beyond--

00:06:21.112 --> 00:06:24.433
MATT: On that note, guys, we'll have our Wyrmwood
giveaway at the break. I'll have all that

00:06:24.433 --> 00:06:29.670
information for you and a reminder at the time.
But for right now, I think it's time to jump into

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.340
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.163
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:07:59.329 --> 00:08:13.179
MATT: Welcome back. Well done, Laura. Welcome
back. Last we left off, our band of adventurers,

00:08:13.179 --> 00:08:16.963
The Mighty Nein, having trekked away from Zadash
northward on two different jobs for The Gentleman,

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:25.073
had accomplished both of these contracted jobs for
him. Losing a friend, gaining a friend, made their

00:08:25.073 --> 00:08:30.486
way back south. Oh my god! Motherfucker!

00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:33.218
(laughter)

00:08:33.218 --> 00:08:34.851
TALIESIN: Wow, that's been a while.

00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:38.554
LAURA: Whoa. Marisha, look! It's your husband.

00:08:38.554 --> 00:08:43.505
TRAVIS: Everything you do, have done, or will do.

00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:45.860
MARISHA: Oh, so good.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.589
TRAVIS: Oh god. Doogie Howser, eat your fucking
heart out.

00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:54.772
MATT: You know that part in the game where you
don't understand why you got so many points into

00:08:54.772 --> 00:08:56.549
renegade as opposed to paragon?

00:08:56.549 --> 00:08:59.464
(laughter)

00:08:59.464 --> 00:09:02.710
LIAM: Now available in the merch store!

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:10.455
MATT: I'm not going to be able to run the game
tonight. I can't focus. Take two.

00:09:10.455 --> 00:09:14.033
TRAVIS: Neither can the fans, steamy Dr. Mercer.

00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:19.486
MATT: Oh, I will never live that down. It's great
when you're a new actor in LA and everyone says,

00:09:19.486 --> 00:09:22.397
"Yeah, you got to get some head shots, and I know
all about it. You got to get those costume and

00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:23.940
"character shots in."

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.159
TRAVIS: Is that what it was? Yes! Oh, I love it!

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:29.200
LIAM: When you show up, right off the truck, you
don't know what you're doing.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.318
MATT: Yeah, you need some archetypes. Come with a
doctor outfit, come with a regular business suit.

00:09:34.318 --> 00:09:39.340
MARISHA: To be fair, I got a few gigs that way, by
doing a few character shots.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:45.295
MATT: I've done a lot of doctors. No, all that
photo has done is this. That is literally the most

00:09:45.295 --> 00:09:46.313
it's ever done.

00:09:46.313 --> 00:09:48.295
LIAM: You're like 17 and a half here, right?

00:09:48.295 --> 00:09:51.967
MATT: That would have been about ten years ago.

00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:53.736
SAM: So early 30s?

00:09:53.736 --> 00:10:04.234
MATT: Yes. We'll go with that one. Anyway, back to
the story at hand! Upon completing your journey,

00:10:04.234 --> 00:10:15.499
checking in with The Gentleman, you were paid the
ripe sum that you had discussed. After taking your

00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:24.307
newfound friend from Shadycreek Run, Ophelia, back
to The Evening Nip, you exited with your new gold

00:10:24.307 --> 00:10:33.831
and platinum in hand. After a celebratory drink to
the memory of Molly, you grabbed Caduceus and led

00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:41.487
him into the city of Zadash-- the largest city
you've ever seen by leaps and bounds-- to see what

00:10:41.487 --> 00:10:46.462
kind of ways you can corrupt this new, fresh mind,
free out of the Savalierwood.

00:10:46.462 --> 00:10:48.495
LAURA: It's so exciting!

00:10:48.495 --> 00:10:57.405
MATT: That is where we left off. In this case,
guys, we have roughly two weeks of downtime. I'm

00:10:57.405 --> 00:11:01.302
going to go around and ask what you would like to
accomplish, and if moments require rolls, moments

00:11:01.302 --> 00:11:05.125
require roleplay, anything like that, we'll jump
into it. I would like to say, who wants to go first?

00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:08.504
TRAVIS: Oh god. One two three, not it!

00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:10.910
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and LAURA: Not it.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.452
TALIESIN: Liam.

00:11:12.452 --> 00:11:15.184
SAM: I didn't say not it. Would you like to go,
Liam?

00:11:15.184 --> 00:11:16.592
LIAM: Not it.

00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:18.766
TRAVIS: Yeah! Come on, Piggly Wiggly!

00:11:18.766 --> 00:11:27.029
SAM: Sure. Not much. Okay, the things I wrote down
were: I would like to use my money.

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:28.908
LAURA: Your money!

00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:35.977
SAM: To buy a bunch of baubles and trinkets and
buttons and ribbons and string and beads and one

00:11:35.977 --> 00:11:37.741
crescent ornament.

00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:44.745
MATT: Okay, I will say you could purchase all of
those things-- and you're buying these yourself?

00:11:44.745 --> 00:11:47.747
SAM: In Disguise Self mode.

00:11:47.747 --> 00:11:58.214
MATT: Okay, yeah. I'd say you could buy all of
those things with, let's say, a single gold,

00:11:58.214 --> 00:12:04.733
because your charisma isn't that high. A single
gold piece for all of that. That's priced up a bit.

00:12:04.733 --> 00:12:06.936
SAM and LAURA: That's pretty good.

00:12:06.936 --> 00:12:15.212
SAM: I will put all of that stuff into a package
and mail it away with a note that I sent you

00:12:15.212 --> 00:12:16.260
earlier, Matt.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.459
MATT: Yep, I have that.

00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:21.926
SAM: Okay, step two! I'm going to take my gun.

00:12:21.926 --> 00:12:23.982
TRAVIS: Your what?

00:12:23.982 --> 00:12:26.899
SAM: Oh, I stole a gun. You weren't there for
that?

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:29.213
MATT: No, that was on the way out of Hupperdook.
They weren't there for that.

00:12:29.213 --> 00:12:30.508
SAM: I stole a gun!

00:12:30.508 --> 00:12:31.835
TRAVIS: You got a gat?

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:34.405
SAM: I stole a gun from a guard. I've got one
bullet.

00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:37.294
TRAVIS: Yeah, like one round, single shot?

00:12:37.294 --> 00:12:43.090
SAM: Yeah! Don't fuck with me, man! I will blow
you away, motherfucker!

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.378
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Okay!

00:12:45.378 --> 00:12:57.357
SAM: Unless I miss, and then it's nothing. No, I
would like to take apart the gun. I'd like to take

00:12:57.357 --> 00:13:04.692
apart the gun and figure out how the hammer works,
how the gunpowder ignites. Is it a pack of powder

00:13:04.692 --> 00:13:10.376
like a bullet, or is it loose powder with a ball?

00:13:10.376 --> 00:13:13.136
MATT: Well, first off, do you have or own
tinkerer's tools?

00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:15.917
SAM: No, but do any of you guys?

00:13:15.917 --> 00:13:17.265
MARISHA: Have what?

00:13:17.265 --> 00:13:19.766
SAM: Tinkerer's tools. I'll go and buy them!

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:27.496
MATT: This next expense will be 50 gold pieces for
the set of tinkerer's tools.

00:13:27.496 --> 00:13:29.143
SAM: No problem.

00:13:29.143 --> 00:13:36.086
MATT: I would need you to make a tinkering check
to see if you can successfully disassemble the gun.

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:37.682
SAM: Does anyone want to help me?

00:13:37.682 --> 00:13:39.275
MATT: Without ruining elements of it.

00:13:39.275 --> 00:13:44.532
LAURA: I don't think any of us have enough
experience to help you.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.916
LIAM: Caleb would help.

00:13:47.916 --> 00:13:50.635
SAM: Do you have tinkering experience?

00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:52.790
LIAM: No, but I'm pretty smart.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:59.677
MATT: You're not proficient in tinkerer's tools,
so it's basically a straight intelligence check.

00:13:59.677 --> 00:14:04.215
Add your intelligence modifier to see if you can
figure out the safest way to do so.

00:14:04.215 --> 00:14:10.017
SAM: I rolled a 14 and I have an intelligence of
plus three.

00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:15.835
MATT: It takes you a little bit of time, but you
manage to very carefully disassemble the entirety

00:14:15.835 --> 00:14:19.518
of the pistol without any issues.

00:14:19.518 --> 00:14:26.131
SAM: I'm specifically curious about how the impact
of the hammer creates an explosion.

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:34.117
MATT: Through the words of the man responsible for
inventing these things naught but 20-plus years

00:14:34.117 --> 00:14:36.896
beforehand, if you would like to explain?

00:14:36.896 --> 00:14:38.050
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:43.850
TALIESIN: There is a flash pan where there's a
preload powder, basically a powder capsule

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:52.176
attaches to a flash pan. The hammer contains a
sparking mechanism that hits a plate, causes a

00:14:52.176 --> 00:14:57.518
spark to hit the powder in the flash pan, goes
into the gunpowder that's within that's actually

00:14:57.518 --> 00:15:01.316
packed inside of the barrel and sends the shot
out.

00:15:01.316 --> 00:15:05.259
SAM: Is it a specific kind of metal that makes a
spark?

00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:07.623
TALIESIN: It actually is a specific kind. It's a
flint.

00:15:07.623 --> 00:15:08.797
SAM: It's a flint metal.

00:15:08.797 --> 00:15:12.071
TALIESIN: Although, people have probably gotten
creative with that at that time, but the Percy

00:15:12.071 --> 00:15:15.160
tech was just a flint. He was trying to do other
stuff and always failed.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:25.186
SAM: With that knowledge, I will purchase any
other materials I will need to do this. I'm going

00:15:25.186 --> 00:15:33.880
to take out the 20 arrows I grabbed from the Iron
Shepherds' house. I'm going to try to modify them,

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:42.456
using multiple arrowheads if needed, to make an
explosive arrowhead that's packed with some

00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:43.951
gunpowder.

00:15:43.951 --> 00:15:48.911
TALIESIN: It would be a bag at the front with a
flint that would spark on pressure. So as long as

00:15:48.911 --> 00:15:52.332
you fired it hard, it would cause the spark when
it hit and detonate.

00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:57.734
MATT: Make a tinker check.

00:15:57.734 --> 00:16:00.407
SAM: Another tinkerer's check! I'm not a good
tinkerer.

00:16:00.407 --> 00:16:02.052
LAURA: Ooh, look at your dice!

00:16:02.052 --> 00:16:03.419
SAM: 11 plus three.

00:16:03.419 --> 00:16:04.674
LAURA: Where did you get those?

00:16:04.674 --> 00:16:06.111
SAM: I got them for free from somebody.

00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:07.336
LAURA: Those are so pretty!

00:16:07.336 --> 00:16:08.450
MARISHA: They're from Norse Foundry.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.274
SAM: From Norse Foundry. Just a 14.

00:16:11.274 --> 00:16:18.382
MATT: I'd say it'll cost you an additional 20 gold
in materials, because you fail multiple times

00:16:18.382 --> 00:16:25.282
going through, and end up wasting a lot of
materials until, eventually, you get it right and

00:16:25.282 --> 00:16:28.657
you're certain that this would be the one that
would function properly. So you have one explosive

00:16:28.657 --> 00:16:30.365
arrow. You're not entirely certain what it does.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:31.993
SAM: One explosive arrow.

00:16:31.993 --> 00:16:33.515
TALIESIN: Welcome to tinkering, man.

00:16:33.515 --> 00:16:38.852
SAM: I'll take the parts of the gun-- it's apart
now, right?

00:16:38.852 --> 00:16:41.141
MATT: Yeah, they're separate individual pieces.

00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:42.752
SAM: I can't put it back together?

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:43.867
MATT: You can certainly try.

00:16:43.867 --> 00:16:46.749
SAM: All right, I'll try. That's a 15.

00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:52.406
MATT: You reassemble it. It looks to be
functional.

00:16:52.406 --> 00:17:01.590
SAM: Okay, and I will look at it and say: Whoever
invented this was a very smart person. She must

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.357
have been a very, very smart person indeed.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.143
TALIESIN: Oh, she was.

00:17:06.143 --> 00:17:16.653
SAM: Okay. Then I have one explosive arrow, maybe.
Great. I'd also like to purchase a pair of gloves

00:17:16.653 --> 00:17:18.389
or have them made.

00:17:18.389 --> 00:17:21.556
MATT: For show or comfort?

00:17:21.556 --> 00:17:28.885
SAM: For comfort and show, human skin color, with
little fingernails embroidered at the end.

00:17:28.885 --> 00:17:31.963
MATT: (laughs) All right, so you have this
commissioned.

00:17:31.963 --> 00:17:33.068
SAM: Yes.

00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:38.856
MATT: Because it is a commission and it is
specific, it'd probably be at the similar store

00:17:38.856 --> 00:17:48.745
to where Beau got her reversible cloak made earlier
in the campaign. It would only take maybe two days

00:17:48.745 --> 00:17:52.522
to get the materials together to match the color
you wanted, and then the embroidery, and finishing

00:17:52.522 --> 00:17:59.478
the gloves for your size specifically. Since you'd
be a smaller frame. All in all, I'd say five gold

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:04.330
pieces. Which is pricey for a set of custom
gloves, but not based on the money you had made.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.931
SAM: Oh, also, with that package I sent earlier, I
also included 100 gold pieces in it.

00:18:08.931 --> 00:18:10.218
MATT: Okay, so mark that off.

00:18:10.218 --> 00:18:16.553
SAM: And then one last thing. I'd like to approach
Jester, and ask her: Jester!

00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:18.576
LAURA: Yes?

00:18:18.576 --> 00:18:20.186
SAM: I need your help.

00:18:20.186 --> 00:18:21.683
LAURA: What do you need help with?

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:24.042
SAM: You are a talented <i>artiste.</i>

00:18:24.042 --> 00:18:25.738
LAURA: Yes, I am very talented.

00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:29.713
SAM: But also, you've mentioned in the past that
you are an expert forger.

00:18:29.713 --> 00:18:32.456
LAURA: Yes, I am! Have you seen my work?
Remember?

00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:34.183
SAM: I've seen you draw dicks on things.

00:18:34.183 --> 00:18:36.901
LAURA: Well, also I've written a lot of letters.

00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:39.544
SAM: You don't really show us those too much.

00:18:39.544 --> 00:18:40.950
LAURA: They're really good.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:50.579
SAM: All right. And also, while you were captured,
I flipped through your book. It's excellent work.

00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:53.163
If there were an art school or something, you
should send it in.

00:18:53.163 --> 00:18:57.618
LAURA: Well, thank you. I did have really good
tutors when I was growing up.

00:18:57.618 --> 00:19:03.582
SAM: I bet. I'd like you to help me forge a
letter. I'd like it to sound like it's from some

00:19:03.582 --> 00:19:12.323
sort of legal entity or law firm or court or
something like that.

00:19:12.323 --> 00:19:15.339
LAURA: Ooh. I'll use something like Esquire or
something in there, that sounds very--

00:19:15.339 --> 00:19:21.888
SAM: Yes, yes, yes. And I'd like to-- oh, could
you not tell Caleb about this?

00:19:21.888 --> 00:19:23.791
LAURA: Secrets?

00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:25.235
SAM: It's a secret.

00:19:25.235 --> 00:19:28.378
LAURA: I'm really good at keeping secrets. Okay.

00:19:28.378 --> 00:19:35.727
SAM: I'd like it to read something like-- Oh! I'm
going to be sending it to the Solstryce Academy.

00:19:35.762 --> 00:19:41.884
LAURA: (gasps) I know about that! That's where
Fjord wants to go. Are we writing this for Fjord?

00:19:41.884 --> 00:19:43.250
SAM: No.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.720
LAURA: Okay!

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.174
SAM: It's in Rexxentrum.

00:19:47.174 --> 00:19:48.976
LAURA: Solstryce, yes, I know where it is.

00:19:48.976 --> 00:19:50.026
MATT: Soltryce.

00:19:50.026 --> 00:19:51.304
LAURA: Soltryce Academy.

00:19:51.304 --> 00:19:52.670
SAM: The Soul Train Academy.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.577
MATT: That's a good way to remember it.

00:19:54.577 --> 00:20:01.387
SAM: Something like: "Greetings. Hello. To whom it
may concern."

00:20:01.387 --> 00:20:02.809
LAURA: To whom it may concern.

00:20:02.809 --> 00:20:09.727
SAM: "I am trying to reach a young lady named
Astrid, no last name given, who was a--"

00:20:09.727 --> 00:20:11.795
LAURA: Wait. Do I say that? No last name given?

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:19.395
SAM: Yes. "Who was a student about 11 years ago at
your academy. She has inherited a bit of money

00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:24.755
"from a distant relative: her uncle, Leonard
Highfin. He's from--"

00:20:24.755 --> 00:20:26.651
LAURA: Leonard Hyphen? Hyphen what?

00:20:26.651 --> 00:20:31.110
SAM: I don't-- Leonard Hyphen Leonard.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.305
LAURA: Leonard Hyphen Leonard. Got it.

00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:37.145
SAM: "From the town of Nigeria."

00:20:37.145 --> 00:20:38.231
LAURA: Got it.

00:20:38.231 --> 00:20:48.879
SAM: "And his estate has employed me to find her
in order to deliver the funds."

00:20:48.879 --> 00:20:52.064
LAURA: (gasps) Vast sums of money. Right. The
funds, okay.

00:20:52.064 --> 00:20:54.811
SAM: "Please reach out to her-- reach out to
me--"

00:20:54.811 --> 00:21:01.147
LAURA: Oh shit. Now I've got to write it again
because you said it wrong. Hold on.

00:21:01.147 --> 00:21:06.968
SAM: Sorry. I didn't know you were writing it as I
was saying. "Please reach out to me with her last

00:21:06.968 --> 00:21:11.973
"known contact information or address. You can
write me in care of The Pillow Trove Hotel,

00:21:11.973 --> 00:21:19.665
"Zadash. Attention--" I don't know. Attention what?
Mrs. Jester? Mrs. Dr. Jester?

00:21:19.665 --> 00:21:25.062
LAURA: No. Mrs. Lavorre, Esquire.

00:21:25.062 --> 00:21:30.737
SAM: Mrs. Lavorre, Esquire. "My legal practice
thanks you in advance. Thank you."

00:21:30.737 --> 00:21:34.195
LAURA: The legal practice of Nott?

00:21:34.195 --> 00:21:37.706
SAM: Nott and Brave.

00:21:37.706 --> 00:21:39.960
LAURA: Nott and Brave Law Firm.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.928
SAM: Yes.

00:21:40.928 --> 00:21:49.585
LAURA: Okay, Nott and Brave Law Firm. Okay. And
then what now? Do you have a seal or something?

00:21:49.585 --> 00:21:51.154
Because it would be sealed really fancy.

00:21:51.154 --> 00:21:54.359
SAM: I don't know. On official letters, do you
kiss them with lipstick? Do you put a little

00:21:54.359 --> 00:21:55.928
perfume on it? What do you do?

00:21:55.928 --> 00:21:59.852
LAURA: You know what? I have my mom's lavender
oil. Hold on.

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:01.884
SAM: That'll make it even more official.

00:22:01.884 --> 00:22:05.976
LAURA: Things that are from really fancy places,
they always have--

00:22:05.976 --> 00:22:07.107
SAM: Sure.

00:22:07.107 --> 00:22:12.523
LAURA: So I'm going to get it on my fingers and
handle the paper. So the paper smells like it was

00:22:12.523 --> 00:22:13.814
handled by someone rich.

00:22:13.814 --> 00:22:17.977
SAM: I've noticed sometimes in letters that I've
stolen from the post, fancy ones anyway, sometimes

00:22:17.977 --> 00:22:21.786
you pull out the letter and then there's this
other piece of tissue paper in there for no

00:22:21.786 --> 00:22:22.868
reason.

00:22:22.868 --> 00:22:27.393
LAURA: Yes. We'll do something like that. I use
another piece of paper because I don't have any

00:22:27.393 --> 00:22:28.724
kind of tissue paper.

00:22:28.724 --> 00:22:34.262
SAM: Just a blank one. All right, and then we mail
it to the Soltryce Academy.

00:22:34.262 --> 00:22:37.228
LAURA: Okay, wait! We need a really fancy seal. We
need wax.

00:22:37.228 --> 00:22:38.760
SAM: Do we have any wax?

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.281
LAURA: I bet Caleb has wax.

00:22:41.281 --> 00:22:43.225
SAM: We can't tell him about this.

00:22:43.225 --> 00:22:45.991
LAURA: Okay. Do you know where any candles are?

00:22:45.991 --> 00:22:47.912
SAM: There's candles everywhere.

00:22:47.912 --> 00:22:52.473
LAURA: Let's take a candle from around the room.
And then we'll stamp it with a ring! One of my rings.

00:22:52.473 --> 00:22:53.480
SAM: Oh, perfect!

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.309
LAURA: Okay, which one is the flattest? This one.
It's got a rose on it.

00:22:57.309 --> 00:23:05.978
MATT: Okay. Two things. One, I would like you to
roll for your forgery.

00:23:05.978 --> 00:23:13.586
SAM: It's a bunch of candle wax. White wax.

00:23:13.586 --> 00:23:16.385
MARISHA: Plain beeswax.

00:23:16.385 --> 00:23:21.163
MATT: Are you proficient with your forgery kit?

00:23:21.163 --> 00:23:28.392
LAURA: Well, I have a forgery kit. How do I know
if I'm proficient? Hold on. I think I am because

00:23:28.392 --> 00:23:32.340
of my background. Yes. No. Yes. I don't know.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.517
MATT: I think you should, depending on your--

00:23:34.517 --> 00:23:39.234
LAURA: Hold on. I'm opening my-- yeah!
Proficiencies and languages. Forgery kit.

00:23:39.234 --> 00:23:49.237
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and roll a d20. Add your
intelligence modifier and your proficiency bonus.

00:23:49.237 --> 00:23:51.609
LAURA: Why intelligence? Can it be the wisdom?

00:23:51.609 --> 00:23:53.130
MATT: Actually, no. Let's make it dexterity.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:59.780
LAURA: Okay. Plus what? My proficiency?

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.720
MATT: Proficiency bonus and your intelligence
modifier. Dex, I'm sorry.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.515
LAURA: That's 12 plus three, is 15.

00:24:05.515 --> 00:24:13.662
MATT: You manage to forge the letter in what you
believe to be a fairly decent forgery.

00:24:13.662 --> 00:24:15.831
LAURA: A really good forgery.

00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:17.092
SAM: It looks like it!

00:24:17.092 --> 00:24:20.273
MATT: You're not matching somebody's handwriting,
per se. It's more about getting an officious look

00:24:20.273 --> 00:24:25.030
to it, with little flourishes of calligraphy at
the beginning of sentences.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.831
SAM: Like a big first letter?

00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:32.111
MATT: Exactly. I would like you to roll a general
dexterity check for me.

00:24:32.111 --> 00:24:40.156
LAURA: Did you see that? It was really trying.
Dexterity check? Ten.

00:24:40.156 --> 00:24:49.241
MATT: Okay. There's a difference between sealing
wax and candle wax. How do I know this? Because

00:24:49.241 --> 00:24:58.959
I've made that mistake before, sealing letters for
previous D&amp;D campaigns. You manage to press your

00:24:58.959 --> 00:25:03.547
ring into the wax and pull back, and now there's
mush on the end of your ring, and there's a

00:25:03.547 --> 00:25:06.918
circular piece of mushed soft wax where the seal
should be.

00:25:06.918 --> 00:25:09.161
LAURA: This is pretty shitty.

00:25:09.161 --> 00:25:10.205
SAM: We need sealing wax.

00:25:10.205 --> 00:25:12.091
LAURA: We need actual sealing wax. I peel it up.

00:25:12.091 --> 00:25:14.710
SAM: Can you go get some from the stiggity store?

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:18.142
LAURA: Yeah. I'll go to the store and buy some
sealing wax.

00:25:18.142 --> 00:25:22.974
MATT: Sealing wax, it's not too expensive. We'll
say two silver to get you a chunk.

00:25:22.974 --> 00:25:25.641
LAURA: Two silver for this wax! You better be
really grateful!

00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:27.995
SAM: I'll pay for postage.

00:25:27.995 --> 00:25:33.283
LAURA: Okay. Now I can send letters to my mom with
a really cool seal!

00:25:33.283 --> 00:25:34.954
SAM: Oh! So you did need it.

00:25:34.954 --> 00:25:41.548
MATT: There you go. You finish the letter. You
seal it best to your ability. You hope it seems

00:25:41.548 --> 00:25:46.115
official enough, and you send it off towards its
destination in Rexxentrum.

00:25:46.115 --> 00:25:47.233
LAURA: Boop!

00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:48.153
SAM: Thank you.

00:25:48.153 --> 00:25:49.146
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:25:49.146 --> 00:25:53.740
SAM: Please don't tell Caleb; he might get upset.
I think that this is someone from his past who

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.498
might be able to, you know, make him think of
happier times.

00:25:57.498 --> 00:25:59.036
LAURA: Who? Astrid?

00:25:59.036 --> 00:25:59.946
SAM: Yes.

00:25:59.946 --> 00:26:05.760
LAURA: (gasps) That's the name he said to me when
we were dancing. Did you know?

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.803
SAM: No.

00:26:06.803 --> 00:26:10.134
LAURA: Yes, we were dancing. We were waltzing. It
was really lovely. He was very drunk.

00:26:10.134 --> 00:26:12.720
SAM: Yes, I remember that night.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.260
LAURA: And then he said something about Astrid.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.842
SAM: He misses her.

00:26:15.842 --> 00:26:17.790
LAURA: Was it his girlfriend?

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:23.899
SAM: I think so. You know, I don't know which way
he swings, but he could really get any girl he

00:26:23.899 --> 00:26:25.106
wanted to.

00:26:25.106 --> 00:26:30.378
LAURA: He's very handsome, especially when he
shaves. You can see the little butt chin he has.

00:26:30.378 --> 00:26:31.581
It's really nice.

00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:34.760
SAM: That's nice. Well, I hope it works.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.185
LAURA: Me too.

00:26:36.185 --> 00:26:38.110
SAM: End scene.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:41.631
MATT: End scene, all right. Is that the extent of
the things you want to accomplish, Nott?

00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:45.080
SAM: I mean, I don't want to take too much time.
I'm good.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.851
MATT: Okay. All righty, who wants to step up
next?

00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:49.921
LIAM: I was the second-to-last to say--

00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:52.311
MATT: That's true, so Caleb.

00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:56.200
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I have some things that I want to
accomplish on my own and then I also need to have

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:03.787
a conversation with Beauregard, but before that I
need to go shopping. I have a list of things I

00:27:03.787 --> 00:27:05.005
want to do, actually.

00:27:05.005 --> 00:27:06.435
TRAVIS: (deadpan) Wait, let me come along.

00:27:06.435 --> 00:27:08.718
LIAM: Do you want to go shopping? Travis, are you
sure?

00:27:08.752 --> 00:27:10.273
MARISHA: Are you going to Pumat's?

00:27:10.273 --> 00:27:11.858
TALIESIN: Let me come along if you're going
shopping.

00:27:11.858 --> 00:27:14.122
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. Oh, what are you in the market for?

00:27:14.122 --> 00:27:17.919
TALIESIN: Well, I figure if we're going to be
traveling together, we should probably have some

00:27:17.919 --> 00:27:21.417
supplies. I'm looking for some diamonds for some
things I know how to do.

00:27:21.417 --> 00:27:24.082
LIAM: Oh, well we have some fellows you could
meet.

00:27:24.082 --> 00:27:26.034
MARISHA: Guys, let's all go shopping!

00:27:26.034 --> 00:27:27.209
TALIESIN: That's great.

00:27:27.209 --> 00:27:28.516
MARISHA: We just got money!

00:27:28.516 --> 00:27:30.631
LIAM: I have a lot of money.

00:27:30.631 --> 00:27:31.766
MARISHA: I'm coming.

00:27:31.766 --> 00:27:33.709
LIAM: Let's go shopping.

00:27:33.709 --> 00:27:34.638
MARISHA: Okay.

00:27:34.638 --> 00:27:38.987
MATT: So the four of you, Jester, Caduceus, Caleb,
and Beauregard, are going shopping.

00:27:38.987 --> 00:27:40.100
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.900
MATT: Okay, all right. Well, what are you guys
looking for?

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.405
TRAVIS: Catch y'all on the flip.

00:27:43.405 --> 00:27:46.892
LIAM: Go see that beautiful baby, Travis.

00:27:46.892 --> 00:27:48.339
TRAVIS: Yeah. Going on a trip.

00:27:48.339 --> 00:27:52.070
MARISHA: I want to go to Pumat.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:28:04.363
MATT: Okay. Midday, you make your way to the
Pentamarket, to the very vibrant center area of the

00:28:04.363 --> 00:28:09.968
marketplace there. There's a number of
intersecting pathways that help divide between all

00:28:09.968 --> 00:28:16.528
the various carts and tents that open up. At this
point, I'd say it's maybe late morning or so. A

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:21.190
lot of the curled up curtains in the front are
being affixed to the top or have been for a while.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:29.124
The smells of fresh baked goods, cooking stews,
and various other treats and snacks that are being

00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:33.118
presented as part of the shopping experience catch
your nostrils as you move through. You hear music

00:28:33.118 --> 00:28:39.568
playing in the distance. For all the chaos that
life has thrown you in the past 30 days, it feels

00:28:39.568 --> 00:28:48.059
nice to step into a place that's so filled with
life and lack of understanding of how dark the

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:52.347
world is at the fringes of this empire, both with
the war going on and some of the things you've

00:28:52.347 --> 00:28:58.698
encountered. It's nice to step into this space and
you catch yourself instinctually smiling and

00:28:58.698 --> 00:29:06.309
finding it infectious to brighten your mood. You
turn to see the darkened green wood with gold

00:29:06.309 --> 00:29:13.110
accoutrements that marks the exterior of The
Invulnerable Vagrant. The front door is closed,

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:17.000
but appears to be not locked for any particular
reason.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.697
MARISHA: I have such a clear picture in my head,
now that we've built it.

00:29:21.697 --> 00:29:27.289
MATT: Now that we've physically built it, yeah.
It's a little larger in-world than the one that we did.

00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:28.541
MARISHA: But the aesthetic.

00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:34.724
MATT: But the aesthetic is there, yeah. As you
step forward, the door opens up and leads you

00:29:34.724 --> 00:29:42.154
inside, and there the same warmly lit interior
with the glowing chandelier above greets you.

00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:50.405
Across the way, sitting behind the desk, face down
in a book, one of the various Pumats, who looks up

00:29:50.405 --> 00:29:57.879
and, "Oh, why hello there! Yeah, oh, it's been a
while. Sorry, took me a second to recognize

00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:05.908
"you. You're very silhouetted by the bright
sunshine outside you right now and it's a bit dark

00:30:05.908 --> 00:30:08.719
"interior, so come on up!"

00:30:08.719 --> 00:30:14.053
MARISHA: We do always seem to come around 4:00pm,
right when the sun is coming in the window.

00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:15.397
LAURA: I run in.

00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:20.126
MATT: Another Pumat comes around the corner and
goes, "Oh, do we have folks in here?" "Yeah, don't

00:30:20.126 --> 00:30:23.746
"worry, Pumat, I got them taken care of. Oh,
there's even more coming in."

00:30:23.746 --> 00:30:29.456
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. Cool, twins. Right. That's
cool. I like this place. This is nice.

00:30:29.456 --> 00:30:32.706
MARISHA: Pumat III, this is Caduceus.

00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:36.896
MATT: "Caduceus! Why, it's a pleasure to meet you
as well."

00:30:36.896 --> 00:30:38.339
TALIESIN: It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:43.717
MATT: "Don't see many of our kind wandering around
these large establishments."

00:30:43.717 --> 00:30:48.241
TALIESIN: You're the first one I've seen in the
city so far. That's pretty crazy. This is

00:30:48.241 --> 00:30:50.140
nice. Is this yours?

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:56.443
MATT: "Well, it's ours. Well, it's his. Hey,
Prime! You might want to step out of the workshop

00:30:56.443 --> 00:31:01.351
"for a second." You hear some rustling and
grumbling in the background, and the curtain opens

00:31:01.351 --> 00:31:06.671
and you see a third one of them step out, goggles
affixed to the head, a little bit of smudges of

00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:10.521
dirt on the edges of the chin. "What are you
talking about? Oh my goodness."

00:31:10.521 --> 00:31:15.281
TALIESIN: You're all brothers, then? There's three
of you now. Triplets. That's great. That's great!

00:31:15.281 --> 00:31:17.159
Don't see that very often.

00:31:17.159 --> 00:31:22.047
MATT: "Where are you from? To be perfectly honest,
we haven't really run into any other firbolgs

00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:24.920
"really since we came here."

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:31.049
TALIESIN: Oh, me neither. I'm actually from up
north. I'm traveling with these kids, working on

00:31:31.049 --> 00:31:32.967
something. It's nice.

00:31:32.967 --> 00:31:34.810
MATT: "Wow."

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:39.535
TALIESIN: How long have you been down here? This
place is great. This is great.

00:31:39.535 --> 00:31:44.713
MATT: "Well, thank you." At this point, the fourth
one comes down from a ladder off on the right side

00:31:44.713 --> 00:31:52.377
chamber. "Oh, is the order getting-- Oh, it's a
whole party over here! Is that another firbolg?"

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:56.984
Comes down and the other's like, "Yeah, there's
one over here." The other Pumat's like, "I'm

00:31:56.984 --> 00:32:01.980
"impressed. I like the color tones. It's a great
arrangement, visual perspective."

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.370
TALIESIN: Impressed by what your mother went
through, at this point. This is intense. There's a

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:07.905
lot of you.

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:12.835
MATT: The one with the goggles in the back goes,
"Sorry about that. I should clarify. These three

00:32:12.835 --> 00:32:19.032
"are arcane-based copies of myself. We are all
collectively Pumat, but I am the original."

00:32:19.032 --> 00:32:22.688
TALIESIN: Well, that's the best thing I've ever
seen. That's crazy. That's just great. I'd love to

00:32:22.688 --> 00:32:24.039
learn how to do that.

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:28.671
LAURA: You shouldn't call them "arcane copies."
They have their own personalities and their own

00:32:28.671 --> 00:32:31.143
self. You should appreciate them.

00:32:31.143 --> 00:32:36.345
MATT: One of the other ones speaks up and goes,
"We absolutely take no offense, because it's true."

00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:41.679
LAURA: Well, all right, but I think each and every
one of you is unique in your own way and you

00:32:41.679 --> 00:32:43.264
should really appreciate it!

00:32:43.264 --> 00:32:48.114
MATT: The three simulacrum all go, "Aww" at the
same time.

00:32:48.114 --> 00:32:50.343
LAURA: I go back to rearranging the shelf.

00:32:50.343 --> 00:32:56.682
TALIESIN: It's nice to see another firbolg out in
the world doing something, and you seem like

00:32:56.682 --> 00:33:00.647
you're really building something great here. This
is spectacular.

00:33:00.647 --> 00:33:06.216
MATT: "Well, I greatly appreciate that. We put a
lot of hard work into it and it's hard to come

00:33:06.216 --> 00:33:09.778
"across folks like us that would appreciate
something on this scale."

00:33:09.778 --> 00:33:14.319
TALIESIN: You might know. Is there anything I
absolutely should see while I'm in town? This is

00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:21.570
the farthest I've been from home. I'm curious if
there's anything in this city that a firbolg out

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.335
taking a look around should--

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:29.763
MATT: "Well, unless I am mistaken, from my
previous memory of times outside of Zadash, when's

00:33:29.763 --> 00:33:32.412
"the last time you had a good bath?"

00:33:32.412 --> 00:33:40.800
TALIESIN: Well, I had a hot spring, which was
nice. I mean, it had some sulfur content and there

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.624
were some minerals in there that were probably a
bit iffy.

00:33:44.624 --> 00:33:46.669
LIAM: The baths here are quite lovely.

00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:50.838
MATT: "This one knows what he's talking about.
Listen to him. Follow that around."

00:33:50.838 --> 00:33:53.041
MARISHA: What are we talking about?

00:33:53.041 --> 00:33:56.378
MATT: "Oh, sorry. Did you come here to do
business?"

00:33:56.378 --> 00:33:57.418
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:33:57.418 --> 00:34:00.587
MATT: Prime goes, "All right, then. Nice to meet
you--?"

00:34:00.587 --> 00:34:02.744
TALIESIN: Caduceus Clay. Pleasure.

00:34:02.744 --> 00:34:04.824
MATT: "Caduceus Clay. Pumat Sol. Pleasure."

00:34:04.824 --> 00:34:06.338
TALIESIN: Look forward to doing business with
yous.

00:34:06.338 --> 00:34:12.728
MATT: "Of course, you got gold, we've got things
to purchase. Anyway, other Pumats, take care of

00:34:12.728 --> 00:34:15.916
"these folks. I've got to get back to work. Good to
see you all again."

00:34:15.916 --> 00:34:17.716
LAURA: Bye, Prime.

00:34:17.716 --> 00:34:22.720
MATT: He exits to the back room. The two other
Pumats step back and watch, and they're both

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.572
looking at you with this kind of--

00:34:24.572 --> 00:34:28.364
TALIESIN: He seems like a decent boss. That seems
nice.

00:34:28.364 --> 00:34:32.914
MATT: "Not too bad. People say you want to be your
own boss, well--"

00:34:32.914 --> 00:34:35.536
(laughter)

00:34:35.536 --> 00:34:38.139
TALIESIN: That's really good.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.769
LIAM: It feels weird to interrupt whatever this
is.

00:34:40.769 --> 00:34:43.820
MARISHA: I'm hungry, so.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.758
MATT: "Unfortunately, we don't really sell much in
the realm of food items."

00:34:47.758 --> 00:34:55.356
LIAM: I am in the market for some things of arcane
nature. Oh, I see you're reading a book. What are

00:34:55.356 --> 00:34:56.657
you reading?

00:34:56.657 --> 00:34:59.751
MARISHA: Ugh, god, no more small talk! You still
have those bracers?

00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:07.654
MATT: "We do, actually. To be perfectly honest,
you mostly cleaned us out last time you were in

00:35:07.654 --> 00:35:09.552
"here, but we've got a few more items in here."

00:35:09.552 --> 00:35:10.856
MARISHA: Yeah, what's up with those bracers?

00:35:10.856 --> 00:35:12.832
MATT: "We got the bracers here, if that's what
you're looking for."

00:35:12.832 --> 00:35:14.365
MARISHA: Have they come down in price?

00:35:14.365 --> 00:35:15.631
MATT: "No."

00:35:15.631 --> 00:35:17.498
MARISHA: They've been sitting on a shelf for six
weeks.

00:35:17.498 --> 00:35:18.709
MATT: "Yeah."

00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:20.862
MARISHA: So, you know.

00:35:20.862 --> 00:35:23.781
MATT: "And six weeks later, you're coming in and
asking about them still."

00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:26.335
LAURA: He does have a point there.

00:35:26.335 --> 00:35:27.571
MARISHA: You know what, Jester?

00:35:27.571 --> 00:35:32.487
MATT: "But yeah, price is still 1200 gold
pieces."

00:35:32.487 --> 00:35:36.002
MARISHA: All right. What do they do again? Can you
explain one more time?

00:35:36.002 --> 00:35:42.594
MATT: "These bracers, enchanted by our fantastic
boss, Pumat Sol, allow the bearer, as long as

00:35:42.594 --> 00:35:48.591
"they're not wearing any physical armor to impede
the enchantment and/or a shield on their body,

00:35:48.591 --> 00:35:54.198
"helps protect them by deflecting incoming blows
and giving them a better sense of avoiding

00:35:54.198 --> 00:35:57.044
"physical atrocity onto their person."

00:35:57.044 --> 00:36:00.899
LAURA: It's like they were specially made for you,
Beau. You have to buy them. I think you should

00:36:00.899 --> 00:36:02.241
charge her more.

00:36:02.241 --> 00:36:04.538
MARISHA: What? Whose side are you on, here?

00:36:04.538 --> 00:36:07.869
LAURA: I feel like you're a very specialized sort
of buyer, is all.

00:36:07.869 --> 00:36:10.358
MARISHA: Right, so if anything, he should give me
a bargain.

00:36:10.358 --> 00:36:13.711
LAURA: Oh, you should give her a deal!

00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:17.756
MATT: "How about we meet in the middle and we
stick with the price provided?"

00:36:17.756 --> 00:36:18.949
TALIESIN: Seems fair.

00:36:18.949 --> 00:36:22.445
MARISHA: You threw him off, Jester.

00:36:22.445 --> 00:36:24.598
LAURA: I'm sorry. I got confused.

00:36:24.598 --> 00:36:26.228
LIAM: Terrible wingwoman.

00:36:26.228 --> 00:36:35.464
MARISHA: Look, we might be purchasing a few
things, so why don't we wait and see what all ends

00:36:35.464 --> 00:36:37.239
up on the counter and then we'll come back.

00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:39.255
MATT: "All right, we'll put this here waiting for
you right there."

00:36:39.255 --> 00:36:41.088
MARISHA: Can I look at it? Can I touch it?

00:36:41.088 --> 00:36:44.547
MATT: "Yeah." You can look at it, but you don't
own it.

00:36:44.547 --> 00:36:49.328
LIAM: <i>Herr</i> Pumat, I am considering spending
about a thousand gold here and I'd be more likely

00:36:49.328 --> 00:36:53.340
to do so if maybe you could give us a better price
for these things here.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:58.577
MATT: "That can be considered, depending on how
much of a purchase you're looking to make. What

00:36:58.577 --> 00:36:59.612
"are you looking for?"

00:36:59.612 --> 00:37:01.520
LIAM: Well, I need--

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.356
(laughter)

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:07.598
MATT: Don't think I've forgotten that silly
string.

00:37:07.598 --> 00:37:18.768
LIAM: I need quite a bit of your finest paper and
ink. I have a dearth of scroll-- a dearth. A

00:37:18.768 --> 00:37:20.710
mighty dearth.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.088
MARISHA: Girth.

00:37:22.088 --> 00:37:30.143
LIAM: That's a different conversation, <i>danke.</i> I
need about roughly 500 or 600 gold's worth of your

00:37:30.143 --> 00:37:31.532
finest paper and ink.

00:37:31.532 --> 00:37:35.103
LAURA: Caleb, save 300 gold because we need
diamonds.

00:37:35.103 --> 00:37:39.530
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to be buying some
diamonds. I wouldn't worry about that.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:44.037
MATT: "If that's the case, if you don't mind
waiting, Pumat III, could you go to our storage

00:37:44.037 --> 00:37:49.016
"facility and get some more of that wizard paper
and ink? It looks like he's buying out our stock

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:53.950
"here at the moment." "Yeah, not a worry. I'll be
back here in the better part of 30 or 40 minutes,

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:57.807
"if you don't mind being patient." That one Pumat
takes a little cloak and throws it over his

00:37:57.807 --> 00:38:00.728
shoulders. "See you guys in a little bit!" And
exits outside.

00:38:00.728 --> 00:38:02.624
LIAM: There's still one left?

00:38:02.624 --> 00:38:07.580
MATT: There's three in the room left behind. One
of them had drifted off to the side for a bit, but

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.765
seems to be still listening in. So you still have
the one that's dealing with you.

00:38:09.765 --> 00:38:20.839
LIAM: I also need incense. Fine incense. About 60
gold worth, if you have that much on hand.

00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:27.612
MATT: "We don't have a whole lot of incense here.
I can probably provide about 20 gold worth of

00:38:27.612 --> 00:38:32.847
"incense. But there are incense makers within
Zadash that I'm sure can probably help you out

00:38:32.847 --> 00:38:34.086
"with the rest of it."

00:38:34.086 --> 00:38:35.257
LIAM: So just not here.

00:38:35.257 --> 00:38:39.109
LAURA: I remember you asking him for incense
before from him, I think.

00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:43.187
LIAM: Yeah, I used it. It's all gone. Just like my
cat.

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:48.963
MATT: "We can definitely look to ordering more
incense if you foresee this being a consistent

00:38:48.963 --> 00:38:52.239
"thing. We normally don't get that much of a
request for it."

00:38:52.239 --> 00:38:59.699
LIAM: Obviously this is a bit of a regular thing.
If, you know, the exchange rate is good. I don't

00:38:59.699 --> 00:39:05.659
need more than the 20 gold's worth of incense
today, if you can order more. We're going to stay

00:39:05.659 --> 00:39:07.299
put for a little while, <i>ja</i>?

00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:08.298
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:39:08.298 --> 00:39:09.337
LAURA: Maybe.

00:39:09.337 --> 00:39:11.576
MARISHA: What's the turnaround-- what?

00:39:11.576 --> 00:39:23.779
LIAM: I'll ask you later. Also-- oh dear. I need
that, and I need that. Oh, yes, I was hoping to

00:39:23.779 --> 00:39:32.438
look through your selection of spells you have
yourself. Nothing too majestic, but I have a short list.

00:39:32.438 --> 00:39:41.060
MATT: "Feel free to ask and I'll go ahead--" and
he grabs this small wood front, wood back, with

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:47.414
leather edging binding ledger or catalog that he
pulls out and opens it up, "Yeah, let me know what

00:39:47.414 --> 00:39:49.525
"you're looking for. I'll tell you if we got one in
stock."

00:39:49.525 --> 00:39:53.967
LIAM: If you could flip to the transmutation.

00:39:53.967 --> 00:39:58.739
MATT: Takes a little set of glasses and puts them
on the edge of his nose. "All right."

00:39:58.739 --> 00:40:04.214
LIAM: I'm looking for one that can help if your
friends are falling and you don't want them to

00:40:04.214 --> 00:40:05.511
fall so hard.

00:40:05.511 --> 00:40:07.517
MATT: "Feather Fall. We got that, sure."

00:40:07.517 --> 00:40:15.004
LIAM: Okay. I get hurt very easily and I need
something to help me get out of Dodge a little bit

00:40:15.004 --> 00:40:16.123
quicker.

00:40:16.123 --> 00:40:22.911
MATT: "All right, there's a few options there. For
lower level enchantments, we got an Expeditious

00:40:22.911 --> 00:40:26.009
"Retreat spell. That'll help get you out of the
thick of things."

00:40:26.009 --> 00:40:27.370
LIAM: That's a winner.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:31.798
MATT: "All right, that's putting that down as well
as a possibility. Those prices here, because

00:40:31.798 --> 00:40:37.798
"they're both relatively simple spells, so I'll put
them at about 100 gold apiece. That's 200 gold

00:40:37.798 --> 00:40:39.940
"total for those two spells."

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:45.202
LIAM: And do you have something that can, say,
catapult things around the room?

00:40:45.202 --> 00:40:47.252
LAURA: I can do that for you.

00:40:47.252 --> 00:40:48.314
MARISHA: Yeah, me too.

00:40:48.314 --> 00:40:49.827
LIAM: But I also want to be able to do it.

00:40:49.827 --> 00:40:55.957
MATT: "Yeah, well, here. Let's see. In the realm
of what you're looking to accomplish here--"

00:40:55.957 --> 00:40:58.074
LAURA: I pick up something and throw it across the
room.

00:40:58.074 --> 00:40:59.659
LIAM: I'm not paying for that.

00:40:59.659 --> 00:41:02.613
TRAVIS: That's some Odyssey of the Mind stuff,
right there.

00:41:02.613 --> 00:41:04.882
MARISHA: I agree with Jester here.

00:41:04.882 --> 00:41:11.818
MATT: "So you're going directly, not messing
around, just a straight Catapult."

00:41:11.818 --> 00:41:13.510
MARISHA: That's so 1994 of you!

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.753
TRAVIS: Straight up catapult?

00:41:14.753 --> 00:41:17.920
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> Straight Up Catapult, is that what
it's called? I'll take that as well.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.540
TALISEN: Are you going to sell him a tiny catapult
that he has to assemble himself?

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:29.871
MATT: It's a straight up catapult. "Catapult,
yeah, we do have that as well. That is 300 gold

00:41:29.871 --> 00:41:32.899
"for the batch of three. Any more spells you're
inquiring about?"

00:41:32.899 --> 00:41:39.384
LIAM: No. There are so many, but I am of a limited
budget. I'll think about it if you can help my

00:41:39.384 --> 00:41:42.081
friend Beauregard with a good price on those.

00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:46.710
LAURA: I also might want to buy weapons, if you
have a weapon that is also really cool and stuff.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:55.952
MATT: "Here, I'll show you what we've been able to
accomplish since your absence. Weapon-wise, this

00:41:55.952 --> 00:42:00.125
"wasn't enchanted more than it was something that
came into our purview from somebody that was

00:42:00.167 --> 00:42:07.161
"looking hard for some cash and we offered them a
bit of an exchange, as it was promising and

00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:15.168
"intriguing." He pulls out this longsword, but
beyond the hilt the blade is snapped and gone.

00:42:15.168 --> 00:42:21.019
It's a broken longsword. It's got a silver hilt
and a silver pommel wrapped in red leathers around

00:42:21.019 --> 00:42:27.117
the handle, and there is a very fine filigree
across the hilt and around the base, this silver

00:42:27.117 --> 00:42:33.428
loop on the bottom of the pommel. But it's a
broken sword.

00:42:33.428 --> 00:42:37.651
LAURA: Are we going to get it fixed? Or can I
still stab people with the broken part?

00:42:37.651 --> 00:42:43.295
MATT: "You've got about an inch of blade there and
it looks like it's still sharp in places. If you

00:42:43.295 --> 00:42:46.226
"get real close you can probably make someone have
a really bad day."

00:42:46.226 --> 00:42:47.682
LAURA: What does it do?

00:42:47.682 --> 00:42:52.852
MATT: "Well, looking it over, it looks like there
was some sort of enchantment embedded in it, but

00:42:52.852 --> 00:43:02.260
"since the blade has been broken, there's not-- it
looks to be very old. Looks like it probably was a

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:10.467
"relic from pre--" He goes and looks at his notes
real fast. "Yeah, this would be pre-Divergence,

00:43:10.467 --> 00:43:17.244
"from the Age of Arcanum. The reason we took it is
the historical significance. We could probably

00:43:17.244 --> 00:43:22.991
"fetch a pretty penny should we take it to the
various lyceums. The Academy would probably be

00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:30.027
"real interested. But if you want to take it off
for sentimental value or go get it repaired some

00:43:30.027 --> 00:43:31.813
"time, it's 300 gold."

00:43:31.813 --> 00:43:35.826
LAURA: Well, I mean, I'll look at it. I don't
know. It's pretty broken-looking.

00:43:35.837 --> 00:43:37.817
TRAVIS: (strained) Buy it.

00:43:37.874 --> 00:43:46.407
MATT: "Prime finished up some of this dust here,"
and he pulls out a small sack that looks to be a

00:43:46.418 --> 00:43:54.574
red-brown dust. He says, "He's proud of this one,
I'm going to be real honest with you. If it's

00:43:54.574 --> 00:44:02.820
"sprinkled over any edible substance, it greatly
improves the flavor. To the point where it's

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:07.778
"downright distracting. It's the Dust of
Deliciousness."

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:09.127
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

00:44:09.127 --> 00:44:10.295
TALIESIN: That's so exciting.

00:44:10.295 --> 00:44:19.896
LAURA: That's a very exciting thing. Oh, that's
expensive. Seems like something you could hold.

00:44:19.896 --> 00:44:21.102
TALIESIN: I'll take that.

00:44:21.102 --> 00:44:25.301
MATT: "Last thing we've got here, and then we're
pretty much out at the moment. You guys have

00:44:25.301 --> 00:44:32.042
"become our number one customers, which is really
appreciated. Just finished this cloak last week

00:44:32.042 --> 00:44:36.546
"here." He steps around the edge and you can see,
while as well decorated as the place is, it's

00:44:36.546 --> 00:44:41.319
pretty bare now. You guys have come through and
grabbed the necessary bits and what else was in

00:44:41.319 --> 00:44:46.694
there has been picked up as well. You guys aren't
the only people who shop here, but you've been the

00:44:46.694 --> 00:44:55.781
most recent, intense customers. He pulls this fine
bluish, purple-tint cloak material, that as it

00:44:55.781 --> 00:45:03.053
flows, as he lifts it up from behind the small
locked box, it ever so faintly gives off this

00:45:03.053 --> 00:45:09.917
shimmer. "This is designed to obfuscate the
movements of the person who wears it, to where it

00:45:09.917 --> 00:45:13.970
"makes him a little more difficult to pay
attention. The enchantments here," and he looks

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:17.977
back, and you can see it, right along the hood of
it, there's these faint little runes. He goes,

00:45:17.977 --> 00:45:24.050
"This is some-- these are Sylvan. I don't know if
any of you read more the classics."

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.590
TALIESIN: I read Sylvan, and there you are.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:32.282
MATT: "Well, there you go. This is specifically a
cloak with an elven enchantment, designed to help

00:45:32.282 --> 00:45:35.514
"make things difficult to see. So there's that one
as well."

00:45:35.514 --> 00:45:37.049
TALIESIN: Yep, let's take a look at that.

00:45:37.049 --> 00:45:38.632
MATT: "That's all we got."

00:45:38.632 --> 00:45:41.366
LAURA and TALIESIN: Ooh.

00:45:41.366 --> 00:45:43.552
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

00:45:43.552 --> 00:45:45.392
LIAM: How much is that running for?

00:45:45.392 --> 00:45:46.668
TALIESIN: 450.

00:45:46.668 --> 00:45:47.993
LAURA: Question.

00:45:47.993 --> 00:45:49.744
MATT: "Yeah, an answer."

00:45:49.744 --> 00:45:55.612
LAURA: Is there anywhere else around town I could
get an enchanted weapon of some sort?

00:45:55.612 --> 00:46:02.428
MATT: "Unfortunately, enchanted weaponry is a very
specialized--"

00:46:02.428 --> 00:46:07.927
LAURA: But everybody else has really cool weapons,
and I just have an axe.

00:46:07.927 --> 00:46:13.973
MATT: "Oh. I'm sorry about that. If you want to
commission an axe, we can start working on

00:46:13.973 --> 00:46:15.394
"enchanting one for you."

00:46:15.394 --> 00:46:16.531
LAURA: How much would that cost?

00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:19.864
MATT: "Well, it depends on what sort of
enchantment you're looking for. If you just--"

00:46:19.864 --> 00:46:22.371
LAURA: Something that makes me really cool.

00:46:22.371 --> 00:46:23.612
MATT: "Okay."

00:46:23.612 --> 00:46:29.969
LAURA: That would make me hit really hard and
probably open wounds that don't close ever, and

00:46:29.969 --> 00:46:34.509
maybe poison people, and also turn them into
candy.

00:46:34.509 --> 00:46:40.318
MATT: The other Pumat is now looking over from the
other room and going like-- He's like, "We'll have

00:46:40.318 --> 00:46:51.831
"to talk to Prime about that. Prime?" Comes out.
"Yeah." He's like, "She wants to see if you could

00:46:51.831 --> 00:46:57.359
"enchant an axe that hits really hard and is
really cool and wounds don't close and--"

00:46:57.359 --> 00:47:04.842
LAURA: Yeah, you know, really bad wounds, also it
really hurts a lot, and it makes people turn pink,

00:47:04.842 --> 00:47:09.682
and also it makes people, like, start dancing and
stuff.

00:47:09.682 --> 00:47:21.703
MATT: You watch as Pumat Prime is actually, in his
head, doing math. "I could probably manage

00:47:21.703 --> 00:47:26.928
"something like that. I got about an eight-month
window for completion, and it would probably run

00:47:26.928 --> 00:47:31.281
"you about... between ten to twelve thousand gold."

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:36.212
LIAM: (continually coughs)

00:47:36.212 --> 00:47:38.330
TRAVIS: You haven't come this far.

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:42.752
LAURA: Seems like a really reasonable price for
all those things.

00:47:42.752 --> 00:47:46.678
MATT: "Oh, I can guarantee it. Won't find anything
better than that, for a specified number of

00:47:46.678 --> 00:47:48.622
"enchantments, this side of Rexxentrum."

00:47:48.622 --> 00:47:55.595
LAURA: What about just one of those enchantments?
What about it just makes people start dancing?

00:47:55.595 --> 00:47:57.445
TALIESIN: Axe dance!

00:47:57.445 --> 00:48:01.062
MATT: "So you want a weapon that, when it hits
somebody, they start dancing?"

00:48:01.062 --> 00:48:06.093
LAURA: They go. Yeah, and they can't stop. It's
like, it would be really hard for them to stop.

00:48:06.093 --> 00:48:10.481
MATT: "All right. So the only enchantment you're
requiring is the possible ability of making

00:48:10.481 --> 00:48:11.943
"something dance uncontrollably."

00:48:11.943 --> 00:48:13.419
LAURA: Oh my god, that would be so cool!

00:48:13.419 --> 00:48:14.405
MATT: "All right."

00:48:14.405 --> 00:48:17.362
MARISHA: I really liked the candy thing, by the
way.

00:48:17.362 --> 00:48:18.870
LAURA: I feel like that would be harder.

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:22.738
MARISHA: Maybe they can just decorate it to look
like candy.

00:48:22.738 --> 00:48:27.764
LAURA: Maybe I could decorate it to look like
candy.

00:48:27.764 --> 00:48:29.460
MARISHA: Oh, craft night!

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:34.870
LIAM: Sad you're not here?

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:36.339
TRAVIS: Yep, so much.

00:48:36.339 --> 00:48:38.569
SAM: Shopping and crafts, Travis!

00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:40.827
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

00:48:40.827 --> 00:48:42.107
MATT: Welcome back, man.

00:48:42.107 --> 00:48:43.506
TRAVIS: Take both my eyes.

00:48:43.506 --> 00:48:46.738
TALIESIN: Do you have your journaling kit? Are you
proficient?

00:48:46.782 --> 00:48:49.363
TRAVIS: What's on TV, babe? HG-- nope, I'm out.

00:48:49.363 --> 00:48:51.679
MARISHA: Michael's had a stationery sale!

00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:59.820
MATT: "There we go. That's going to be-- It's
doable. It's pricey. That one will put you about

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.046
"8,000 gold."

00:49:01.046 --> 00:49:02.147
SAM: Jesus!

00:49:02.147 --> 00:49:05.099
LAURA: I don't have that much either. Wait, do I?

00:49:05.099 --> 00:49:06.303
TRAVIS: No.

00:49:06.303 --> 00:49:07.907
LAURA: No, I don't.

00:49:07.907 --> 00:49:09.501
TRAVIS: How about layaway?

00:49:09.501 --> 00:49:14.333
MATT: "Sorry. If you want just something that's
pretty sharp and helps you hit a little better, I

00:49:14.333 --> 00:49:15.869
"could do that for much cheaper."

00:49:15.869 --> 00:49:17.038
LAURA: How much?

00:49:17.038 --> 00:49:30.598
MATT: "Let's see. That one will put you back
about, I'd say, maybe 400 gold?"

00:49:30.598 --> 00:49:32.368
LAURA: Ooh! That sounds way better!

00:49:32.368 --> 00:49:34.120
MATT: "Could finish that in about four or five
days, yeah."

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.537
LAURA: Whoa! Okay, I'll do that!

00:49:35.537 --> 00:49:39.837
MATT: "All righty, just provide the weapon, and
we'll get that taken care of for you."

00:49:39.837 --> 00:49:41.077
LAURA: Here, take this one.

00:49:41.077 --> 00:49:42.319
MATT: "Okay." What kind of axe is it?

00:49:42.319 --> 00:49:44.011
LAURA: It's an axe.

00:49:44.011 --> 00:49:44.953
TRAVIS: Handaxe.

00:49:44.953 --> 00:49:45.968
LAURA: It's a handaxe.

00:49:45.968 --> 00:49:47.375
MATT: Handaxe. Okay, so it can be thrown as well.

00:49:47.375 --> 00:49:49.617
LAURA: Ooh! Yes, it can.

00:49:49.617 --> 00:49:51.400
TRAVIS: Did you just now realize that?

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.347
LAURA: Yep!

00:49:52.347 --> 00:49:57.183
MATT: "All right. We'll go ahead and we'll get
right on that for you, not a worry."

00:49:57.183 --> 00:49:58.371
LAURA: Sweet!

00:49:58.371 --> 00:49:59.817
MATT: "So that'd be 400 gold for that."

00:49:59.817 --> 00:50:00.753
LAURA: Okay!

00:50:00.753 --> 00:50:04.778
MATT: "Put that in the pot right there, since
you're looking for possibly other purchases.

00:50:04.778 --> 00:50:07.626
"That's 400 gold pieces. What else you looking to
buy?"

00:50:07.626 --> 00:50:10.813
TALIESIN: I'm thinking I'm--

00:50:10.813 --> 00:50:12.263
LAURA: I mean, we should get that, right?

00:50:12.263 --> 00:50:13.324
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I think I want--

00:50:13.324 --> 00:50:15.489
LAURA: Longswords aren't simple weapons, so I
can't?

00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:16.333
MATT: Yeah.

00:50:16.333 --> 00:50:17.297
LAURA: Yeah.

00:50:17.297 --> 00:50:19.794
TALIESIN: But I don't know. I like broken things.

00:50:19.794 --> 00:50:21.245
SAM: (cooing) What about the cloak?

00:50:21.245 --> 00:50:23.012
TALIESIN: Oh, no, we're getting the cloak.

00:50:23.012 --> 00:50:24.444
MATT: "All right, so that's--"

00:50:24.444 --> 00:50:27.138
TALIESIN: Caleb, do you want to split that cloak
with me, maybe?

00:50:27.138 --> 00:50:33.613
LIAM: Oh, I'm allocating my funds to other things,
my friend, I'm sorry.

00:50:33.613 --> 00:50:35.184
TALIESIN: Oh well, I'll get the cloak then.

00:50:35.184 --> 00:50:36.442
LAURA: I'll help you get the cloak.

00:50:36.442 --> 00:50:41.223
MARISHA: Well, here's the deal, Pumat. What was
that you said five or so minutes ago about us

00:50:41.223 --> 00:50:43.667
being your number one customers?

00:50:43.667 --> 00:50:48.997
LAURA: Ooh, yeah, and you would give us a deal if
we bought a whole bunch of stuff?

00:50:48.997 --> 00:50:51.064
TALIESIN: Is this where we go for the diamonds,
too?

00:50:51.064 --> 00:50:57.127
LIAM: I am dropping a total, if we're all
amenable, 960 gold on various things, and I think

00:50:57.127 --> 00:51:02.120
that is a pretty good pile. Maybe you could knock
a couple hundred off of the price of those

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.237
bracers.

00:51:03.237 --> 00:51:05.927
MATT: Make a persuasion check, with advantage
since everybody's helping you.

00:51:05.927 --> 00:51:10.158
MARISHA: Come on! Get it! That's good!

00:51:10.158 --> 00:51:13.497
LIAM: Yeah, that is a 21.

00:51:13.497 --> 00:51:23.221
MATT: You see the Pumats talking to you kind of,
"Let me go ahead and have a conversation with the

00:51:23.221 --> 00:51:31.224
"boss man. Hold on just a second." Turns around the
corner. You hear some hushed voices. "Yeah, fine,

00:51:31.224 --> 00:51:38.349
"sure." He comes back out, "All right, we got
ourselves an approval for a discount there. We'll

00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:42.621
"be happy to knock about a hundred gold off that
total price for you, if that's amenable to you."

00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:44.590
TALIESIN: That's pretty amenable.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:48.406
LAURA: Sure. All of us save 20 gold, still pretty
good.

00:51:48.406 --> 00:51:49.932
MARISHA: Yeah, that's about it.

00:51:49.932 --> 00:51:51.333
MATT: "All right, so who's buying what?"

00:51:51.333 --> 00:51:52.455
LAURA: 25 gold!

00:51:52.455 --> 00:51:54.416
TALIESIN: I'm getting the sword and the cloak.

00:51:54.416 --> 00:51:55.790
MATT: "Sword and the cloak."

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:56.980
LAURA: I'm going halvsies on the cloak with him.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.125
TALIESIN: Oh, well, thank you.

00:51:58.125 --> 00:51:59.122
MATT: "All righty. Well, here."

00:51:59.122 --> 00:52:00.314
MARISHA: I'll take those bracers.

00:52:00.314 --> 00:52:02.512
MATT: "Well here, I'll do a total price here, and
then you guys can--"

00:52:02.512 --> 00:52:06.740
LIAM: 872, 873, 874.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.111
LAURA and SAM: Oh, no.

00:52:09.111 --> 00:52:11.016
MATT: "It's 400 for getting your handaxe
enchanted."

00:52:11.016 --> 00:52:14.939
LAURA: Yes, and then another two because I'm going
in halvsies on the cloak.

00:52:14.939 --> 00:52:16.187
LIAM: 949.

00:52:16.187 --> 00:52:19.395
MATT: "Well, I'm doing a total amount here first,
don't-- You guys can decide how to divvy it up for you."

00:52:19.395 --> 00:52:24.490
LIAM: 951, 952.

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:25.878
SAM: Do you take cards?

00:52:25.878 --> 00:52:30.351
MATT: "So that's 450 for the cloak. That's 1,200
for the bracers. That's 300 for the handle. No dust?"

00:52:30.351 --> 00:52:34.274
TALIESIN: No, we'll pass on the dust for now. It's
interesting.

00:52:34.274 --> 00:52:37.979
MATT: "And then you got a-- and then 300 for the
spells."

00:52:37.979 --> 00:52:45.748
LIAM: Yeah, and 600 gold with of paper and ink,
and then 20 for all the incense you have right

00:52:45.748 --> 00:52:49.879
now, and I'm going to leave 40 in advance for more
incense coming.

00:52:49.879 --> 00:52:58.806
MATT: "Hold on a second there. So it's 300 worth
of spells, and you said 600 worth of paper and

00:52:58.806 --> 00:53:04.096
"ink, right?" At this time you guys have been
discussing, the other Pumat comes back with his

00:53:04.096 --> 00:53:10.157
cloak with a big old crate in his hand and goes,
"Got the rest of the paper and ink. Hold on." Sets

00:53:10.157 --> 00:53:11.465
it down.

00:53:11.465 --> 00:53:12.851
LIAM: Oh, jeez.

00:53:12.851 --> 00:53:18.436
MATT: "Then that is 20 gold for your incense?"

00:53:18.436 --> 00:53:24.281
LIAM: I would like to give you 60 gold now for
that much incense. I understand you only have

00:53:24.281 --> 00:53:28.317
about 20 now, but I know you're good for the rest,
so I'll just pay in advance.

00:53:28.317 --> 00:53:32.630
MATT: "All right. Are you guys all marking off
your amounts?"

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:33.819
MARISHA: Yeah. Costs?

00:53:33.819 --> 00:53:35.600
TALIESIN: Well, we're waiting for the total, but
yeah.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.463
MARISHA: I'm taking just 25 gold off of my
bracers.

00:53:38.463 --> 00:53:41.460
MATT: "Based on how many pieces you've thrown at
me, it's probably better to have you all just

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.535
"deduct what you've spent individually. I was going
to try that, but then..."

00:53:44.535 --> 00:53:45.867
MARISHA: No.

00:53:45.867 --> 00:53:47.343
MATT: "That got a little chaotic there."

00:53:47.343 --> 00:53:48.967
MARISHA: Give me them bracers!

00:53:48.967 --> 00:53:54.944
MATT: "All righty, so there's your sword, there's
your bracers, there's your cloak."

00:53:54.944 --> 00:54:03.244
LAURA: With the dust of deliciousness, is that one
use, or multiple uses?

00:54:03.244 --> 00:54:05.354
MATT: "Six servings of dust in this."

00:54:05.354 --> 00:54:06.878
TALIESIN: That's why I was like hmm.

00:54:06.878 --> 00:54:08.315
LAURA: That's still pretty good.

00:54:08.315 --> 00:54:09.344
TALIESIN: It's still good, but--

00:54:09.344 --> 00:54:10.771
LAURA: (whispers) Okay, I want some of that, too.

00:54:10.771 --> 00:54:14.951
MATT: "All right. Well, there you go. Go ahead and
mark off that amount there as well. When all is

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:20.059
"said and done, when you've marked off your
amounts, here's a hundred gold back. You may

00:54:20.059 --> 00:54:21.715
"redistribute it as you see fit."

00:54:21.715 --> 00:54:23.500
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, you got a hundred dollar
rebate!

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.105
MARISHA: We got a rebate, 100 gold!

00:54:25.105 --> 00:54:26.506
LAURA: Really?

00:54:26.506 --> 00:54:28.627
MATT: Well, that was what you haggled them down.

00:54:28.627 --> 00:54:29.854
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh.

00:54:29.854 --> 00:54:31.880
MARISHA: Oh, so we're-- Okay, we're good.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.025
MATT: It just makes it easier than adding.

00:54:33.025 --> 00:54:35.857
LAURA: Will you take five gold off of the dust
because you like me?

00:54:35.857 --> 00:54:38.948
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:54:38.948 --> 00:54:42.003
TALIESIN: We all take 25-- We each saved 25 gold.

00:54:42.003 --> 00:54:43.303
MARISHA: 25 gold.

00:54:43.303 --> 00:54:44.407
SAM: What?

00:54:44.407 --> 00:54:46.767
LAURA: That means he likes me! 20!

00:54:46.767 --> 00:54:51.295
MATT: "Well, only because you asked so nice, but
don't tell the boss."

00:54:51.295 --> 00:54:52.880
LAURA: (whispers) I won't.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.335
MATT: "All right?"

00:54:55.335 --> 00:54:56.455
LAURA: Cool.

00:54:56.455 --> 00:55:01.184
MARISHA: Feels so good! Feels like real shopping;
I get a shopping high! Cathartic!

00:55:01.184 --> 00:55:06.345
MATT: "So I'll see you back here in about five
days or so there, Jester, and we should have a

00:55:06.345 --> 00:55:08.854
"fresh, new, enchanted handaxe there for you."

00:55:08.854 --> 00:55:09.828
LAURA: Okay!

00:55:09.828 --> 00:55:13.857
MATT: "All righty. Well, it's been a pleasure."

00:55:13.857 --> 00:55:16.578
LIAM: Thank you for your business. What was that
book that you were reading?

00:55:16.578 --> 00:55:23.506
MATT: "Oh, it's--" He pulls it up again. "It's
that Taryon fellow, or whatever. But I'm most of

00:55:23.506 --> 00:55:26.137
"the way through it. Kind of a slow reader."

00:55:26.137 --> 00:55:28.360
LIAM: Are you the last Pumat of the Pumats to read
it?

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.544
MATT: "Yeah, we've been kind of passing it around
as we each finish it."

00:55:31.544 --> 00:55:33.270
LIAM: Hmm. You should form a book club.

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:38.944
MATT: "I'll ask him. Really appreciate the
suggestion."

00:55:38.944 --> 00:55:44.365
LIAM: Well, thank you for your business, I have a
lot to do. And I am going to attempt to lift the

00:55:44.365 --> 00:55:46.070
crate of paper.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:47.317
TALIESIN: I can help with that.

00:55:47.317 --> 00:55:48.205
LIAM: Oh, thank you.

00:55:48.205 --> 00:55:50.855
TALIESIN: Yep. (grunts) Yeah, that's-- Oh, that's
heavy.

00:55:50.855 --> 00:55:52.115
LIAM: With the legs.

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.292
TALIESIN: (grunts)

00:55:53.292 --> 00:55:54.751
LIAM: Exeunt.

00:55:54.751 --> 00:56:02.346
MATT: Most of the weight is the materials that
contain the paper. The paper isn't very heavy, but

00:56:02.346 --> 00:56:09.824
because it is specifically designed and made for
the uses of inscribing and enchantment and other

00:56:09.824 --> 00:56:17.558
things, it is contained in very, very careful,
protective wooden boxes. They're all stacked

00:56:17.558 --> 00:56:19.257
repeatedly within this crate.

00:56:19.257 --> 00:56:23.495
LIAM: And I guess as we're leaving, walking along,
Beauregard, who's sort of googling at her new

00:56:23.495 --> 00:56:26.955
bracers, do you have any plans--

00:56:26.955 --> 00:56:28.424
MARISHA: Do they look cool?

00:56:28.424 --> 00:56:30.197
LIAM: I don't know how to answer that.

00:56:30.197 --> 00:56:32.059
MATT: "Hey, Caduceus! Pleasure to meet you."

00:56:32.059 --> 00:56:35.684
TALIESIN: Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, as
well. I'm sure we'll see each other again real soon.

00:56:35.684 --> 00:56:38.765
MATT: "We'll hope so. Brightened up the room."

00:56:38.765 --> 00:56:40.667
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. And what a room to
brighten.

00:56:40.667 --> 00:56:42.176
MATT: "Aww, you're too kind."

00:56:42.176 --> 00:56:43.385
TALIESIN: You're the best.

00:56:43.385 --> 00:56:44.867
MARISHA: Do they, like, go with the outfit,
though?

00:56:44.867 --> 00:56:47.332
LIAM: You look angry.

00:56:47.332 --> 00:56:49.483
MARISHA: Yeah? Dope.

00:56:49.483 --> 00:56:56.593
LIAM: Do you have any, er, plans to-- well, I
would like to, I don't know if you want to. But

00:56:56.593 --> 00:56:58.249
may I go to the library again with you?

00:56:58.249 --> 00:56:59.481
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:56:59.481 --> 00:57:00.945
LIAM: Oh, thank you.

00:57:00.945 --> 00:57:05.258
MARISHA: I'm going back probably tomorrow, next
day, something like that.

00:57:05.258 --> 00:57:06.468
LIAM: Oh, for a day or two?

00:57:06.468 --> 00:57:11.904
MARISHA: I was thinking like an extended weekend.
Like a Friday-to-Monday, four-days-three-nights

00:57:11.904 --> 00:57:13.459
type of thing, if you're down.

00:57:13.459 --> 00:57:16.151
LIAM: Er, yes. If you wouldn't mind, I would be
very--

00:57:16.151 --> 00:57:19.082
MARISHA: You don't have to stay the whole time,
but that's what I'm going to do. You can do whatever the

00:57:19.113 --> 00:57:20.196
fuck you want.

00:57:20.196 --> 00:57:22.117
LIAM: If they give me-- Would I be allowed to
peruse this--

00:57:22.117 --> 00:57:23.475
MARISHA: I'm not your fucking babysitter.

00:57:23.475 --> 00:57:26.582
LIAM: I did not say you were my babysitter! I just
wanted to look at the books!

00:57:26.582 --> 00:57:28.189
MARISHA: Just want to get that out there.

00:57:28.189 --> 00:57:32.641
LIAM: I don't know why you had that in your mind!
I just want to look-- Thank you. And I walk off

00:57:32.705 --> 00:57:34.426
with my paper.

00:57:34.426 --> 00:57:39.048
TALIESIN: We're going to be looking for a gem
shop. And also, if there's an herb shop. I've been

00:57:39.048 --> 00:57:43.734
meaning to learn how to make healing potions. I've
gotten a little bit of a basic understanding.

00:57:43.734 --> 00:57:46.578
LIAM: (whispers) I do have a couple things left on
my to-do list though, okay?

00:57:46.578 --> 00:57:48.404
(laughter)

00:57:48.404 --> 00:57:51.068
TALIESIN: And some general shopping that's just
some stuff that doesn't really have--

00:57:51.068 --> 00:57:55.486
MATT: Yeah, there's Grace of the Wilds, which is
in the Pentamarket district. You find it. You in

00:57:55.486 --> 00:58:00.741
particular, you find it very quickly because
you're attuned to the smell of some of the herbs

00:58:00.741 --> 00:58:04.876
and various mosses that they're been cultivating
and drying out there. You're like, (sniffs).

00:58:04.876 --> 00:58:08.588
That's familiar. (sniffs) Yeah. And so, much like
Toucan Sam, you follow your nose--

00:58:08.588 --> 00:58:10.057
TALIESIN: It always knows!

00:58:10.057 --> 00:58:18.146
MATT: --to Grace of the Wilds, and there you see a
female woman, 50s, with kind of wild, big, black,

00:58:18.146 --> 00:58:25.426
curly hair, who's just sitting there. Nobody else
is paying mind to the front, little tent that she

00:58:25.426 --> 00:58:29.162
has set up that is attached to what appears to
be the rest of her shop, which is mostly

00:58:29.162 --> 00:58:35.366
closed-off and dark. As you approach, she glances
over and goes, "Hah! Hi! Can I help you? What do

00:58:35.366 --> 00:58:37.432
you need, what do you need? What can I do?"

00:58:37.432 --> 00:58:38.963
LAURA: Hi! Are you Grace?

00:58:38.963 --> 00:58:43.308
MATT: "No, I'm Jesna Bree. But this is Grace of
the Wilds, this is my shop. But welcome! Welcome.

00:58:43.308 --> 00:58:44.637
"Welcome, welcome."

00:58:44.637 --> 00:58:52.498
TALIESIN: I'm still playing catch-up, one second.
Hi! I was curious-- I was looking to maybe start

00:58:52.498 --> 00:58:55.361
learning how to make some healing potions of some
kind--

00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:57.045
MATT: "For training? You want to train?"

00:58:57.045 --> 00:59:04.515
TALIESIN: Well, yeah. I mean, if that's possible.
And also, I'm-- just some stuff for cooking. And

00:59:04.515 --> 00:59:08.340
otherwise I'm just looking for a nice general set
of a few things. I've got a list here, just some

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:09.727
food flavors as well.

00:59:09.727 --> 00:59:12.145
MATT: "Of course, of course! Just give me your
list, I'd like to see."

00:59:12.145 --> 00:59:16.052
TALIESIN: Oh, sure. This is actually my general--

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:21.130
MATT: I know. I figured. "Oh. Ah. Okay, yeah!" And
as she's talking to you, you watch as her other

00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:25.563
hand takes a piece of chalk and is writing on the
wall behind her. "I'd be more than happy to help,

00:59:25.563 --> 00:59:29.688
and I can help! A lot of things I can help you
with too, and I'm happy to!" And then, in kind of

00:59:29.688 --> 00:59:32.400
crappy handwriting underneath all the various
prices of the herbs and things that are provided

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:39.623
you now see 'training.' She's added it to her list
of things that she does, as talking to you.

00:59:39.623 --> 00:59:43.022
TALIESIN: You're probably the person to ask if
there's a good tea shop in town. I feel like you'd

00:59:43.022 --> 00:59:45.367
probably know where to get a nice caffeinated
beverage.

00:59:45.367 --> 00:59:49.131
MATT: "Oh! Oh, yes. Oh yes. Oh yes, I can help
with the tea. The tea? I can help

00:59:49.131 --> 00:59:52.864
"with. So, training! What do you want to train in?
Please, tell me."

00:59:52.864 --> 00:59:55.802
TALIESIN: I've been hoping to learn how to make
healing potions, actually, in general. Just start

00:59:55.802 --> 00:59:59.317
to kind of break in that, uh--

00:59:59.317 --> 01:00:03.233
MATT: "Okay, okay. Okay, that can be done. It may
take some time. Little bit of time. Give me your

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:04.857
"time, we'll make it work."

01:00:04.857 --> 01:00:10.240
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh my god, she's got a caffeine
fucking IV under the desk. Holy shit.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.940
MATT: The herbalism kit for this is-- It's five--
you already have one.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:16.710
TALIESIN: I have an herbalism kit, I just want
to-- do I need a special proficiency or get the

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:19.405
ingredients to help make one. I do have the
herbalism kit.

01:00:19.405 --> 01:00:22.384
MATT: Yeah, you would be purchasing proficiencies,
the training is what you would be doing. This

01:00:22.384 --> 01:00:25.769
would be the bulk of your downtime, because it
will take a while for you to really get--

01:00:25.769 --> 01:00:28.560
TALIESIN: I only had a couple other light things I
was going to do anyway.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:34.510
MATT: But the full training for this will come to
about, I'll say, 200 gold.

01:00:34.561 --> 01:00:35.981
TALIESIN: I can do that.

01:00:35.981 --> 01:00:38.844
MATT: And you are now proficient in the herbalism
kit.

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:43.593
TALIESIN: Actually, I was already proficient in
the herbalism kit, I was just specifically looking

01:00:43.593 --> 01:00:45.423
for the stuff to make the potions.

01:00:45.423 --> 01:00:47.651
MATT: Oh, I misunderstood! Oh!

01:00:47.651 --> 01:00:52.566
TALIESIN: No, I got that already. I've never--
Back when I did this they didn't have all this

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:53.717
craziness.

01:00:53.717 --> 01:00:57.636
MATT: I've got you. Well, if that's the case,
buying the materials-- You're essentially buying

01:00:57.636 --> 01:01:02.963
them at half-price. You can make healing potions,
but you get to make them at 25 gold apiece, as

01:01:02.963 --> 01:01:04.435
opposed to 50.

01:01:04.435 --> 01:01:10.993
TALIESIN: Sure! I'll get-- Let's get 150 gold
worth of that, and then probably some cooking

01:01:10.993 --> 01:01:12.404
spices, too.

01:01:12.404 --> 01:01:14.910
MATT: Okay, yeah. Cooking spices will run you a
gold for the full set.

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:22.371
TALIESIN: Oh, so it's 151. Anything else of
interest or otherwise? Maybe some good beverages

01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:23.823
or otherwise there?

01:01:23.823 --> 01:01:26.510
MATT: You can find a whole bevy of beverages all
throughout the Pentamarket.

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:33.309
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll find other stuff otherwise.
Other than that I've got diamonds and some-- I'm

01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:37.337
looking for some general store kind of stuff.

01:01:37.337 --> 01:01:44.412
MATT: Okay. So at 150 gold, (counting) that's six
healing potions that you have the materials to

01:01:44.412 --> 01:01:48.962
make. But you can spend your downtime during this
week to make a few, if you'd like.

01:01:48.962 --> 01:01:50.208
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:54.800
MATT: That'll put you at about one potion per day
of creation. So you can easily take this time to

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.882
make all six.

01:01:55.882 --> 01:01:57.088
TALIESIN: Oh, easily.

01:01:57.088 --> 01:02:02.520
MATT: They're baseline healing potions, level one,
but you should be able to do so. Cool. And you

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.851
made a friend with Jasna Bree!

01:02:03.851 --> 01:02:05.192
TALIESIN: Wow, that's a lot.

01:02:05.192 --> 01:02:09.026
MATT: She's a little sad that she doesn't get a
chance to teach you or train you, but she's like,

01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:11.754
"That's okay, next time! Next time. Whenever you
feel like it, you come on by. I'll teach you. No

01:02:11.754 --> 01:02:12.704
"worries."

01:02:12.704 --> 01:02:13.857
TALIESIN: Oh, that's excellent.

01:02:13.857 --> 01:02:14.607
LAURA: Deuce.

01:02:14.607 --> 01:02:15.351
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:16.194
LAURA: We need to buy some diamonds.

01:02:16.194 --> 01:02:18.871
TALIESIN: We need diamonds. I also need a new tea
kettle. But yeah, we need diamonds.

01:02:18.871 --> 01:02:22.524
MATT: A tea kettle you can get.

01:02:22.524 --> 01:02:26.997
TALIESIN: I need a-- I want a tea kettle, I want
some new cookware, I want some kitchen supplies, I

01:02:26.997 --> 01:02:32.494
want a straw hat. I would like a hat. It's hot
out. There's the sun, and I can feel the sun, it's

01:02:32.494 --> 01:02:34.189
as if I've been in the sun all day.

01:02:34.189 --> 01:02:37.663
(laughter)

01:02:37.663 --> 01:02:39.421
TALIESIN: Not quite this hat, but it's in the
right direction.

01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:40.414
TRAVIS: Wider brim?

01:02:40.414 --> 01:02:41.734
TALIESIN: Wider brim. Wider brim.

01:02:41.734 --> 01:02:50.181
MATT: I'd say you manage to acquire the cooking
supplies, the kettle, some fine teas that you can

01:02:50.181 --> 01:02:53.036
acquire, and altogether I'd say--

01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:54.318
TALIESIN: I have stuff to cook.

01:02:54.318 --> 01:03:00.134
MATT: I'd say that would put you back about-- with
the hat? Four gold.

01:03:00.134 --> 01:03:02.281
TALIESIN: Oh, man. All right, 155.

01:03:02.281 --> 01:03:03.560
MATT: You weren't asking for anything too crazy.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.435
TALIESIN: Nope, that's cool. I'm easy. Now we just
need to find the diamonds.

01:03:06.435 --> 01:03:08.057
LAURA: Now we need to find some diamonds.

01:03:08.057 --> 01:03:11.176
MATT: All right. So for that? Let's see here.

01:03:11.176 --> 01:03:13.809
MARISHA: I typed in the bracers and they showed up
with an image.

01:03:13.809 --> 01:03:15.006
LAURA: Whoa!

01:03:15.006 --> 01:03:16.066
SAM: How? What?

01:03:16.066 --> 01:03:19.212
MARISHA: That's in D&amp;D Beyond. (singing) D&amp;D
Beyond.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:21.486
SAM: (singing) Be my girl tonight, D&amp;D Beyond.

01:03:21.486 --> 01:03:23.452
LIAM: They even had my hand-me-down Periapt of
Wound Closure.

01:03:23.452 --> 01:03:26.051
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:03:26.051 --> 01:03:29.313
LAURA: Both of us, or just me?

01:03:29.313 --> 01:03:33.818
MATT: Well, if you're both looking for it, you can
aid or help. So, advantage on that.

01:03:33.818 --> 01:03:35.205
LAURA: Advantage!

01:03:35.205 --> 01:03:37.626
SAM: This is for diamonds? Ooh.

01:03:37.626 --> 01:03:43.833
LAURA: (singing) Investigation. 11. Sorry.

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:54.150
MATT: 11. Asking around, most folks-- Well,
diamonds as a rough, raw material is hard to find.

01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:57.610
Usually, they're already embedded in jewelry and
most jewelers are out there. Eventually, somebody

01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:01.600
points you to a place, like, (dismissively) "If
anyone will have it, it's probably over at Suvo's Secrets."

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.044
LAURA and SAM: Suvo's Secrets?

01:04:04.044 --> 01:04:11.285
MATT: Suvo's Secrets. And they point you over to
this large, gray shop tent that has an ominous

01:04:11.285 --> 01:04:15.928
feel when you look at it. As bright a day as it
is, it's like the Addams Family house in the

01:04:15.928 --> 01:04:19.726
Pentamarket. It looks... it looks unwelcome.

01:04:19.726 --> 01:04:23.061
TRAVIS: On Halloween, all the kids are outside?

01:04:23.061 --> 01:04:29.436
MATT: Yeah, it's a very drab, very coarse material
that the tent is made out of. Outside, it looks

01:04:29.436 --> 01:04:33.696
like the ropes that are affixing it down are
rotted a bit, and you can see that some of the

01:04:33.696 --> 01:04:39.343
ropes are starting to pull and tear on the edges.
It looks closed. Except for there's-- where the

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:43.934
flaps come together in the middle. It doesn't look
like anything that you should buy from.

01:04:43.934 --> 01:04:45.564
LAURA: Let's go in there.

01:04:45.564 --> 01:04:47.515
TALIESIN: I'm very excited. It looks great!

01:04:47.515 --> 01:04:52.599
MATT: All right. As you enter Suvo's Secrets--
(laughing) You're hitting the tent front? You're

01:04:52.599 --> 01:04:53.656
not walking in?

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:54.917
LAURA: No, we're seeing if it's open.

01:04:54.917 --> 01:05:01.583
MATT: Yeah, it's open. It's an entrance. You go
inside and the interior-- It's maybe 20 feet by 20

01:05:01.583 --> 01:05:07.003
feet, it's not a very large interior space. And it
looks like there are some tables set up on the far

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:13.054
ends, perimeter to the outside of it. And on the
back, there is a very, very large custom rocking

01:05:13.054 --> 01:05:23.804
chair that is just like, (creaking). And sitting
in it, you see an older, very intense-looking

01:05:23.804 --> 01:05:31.614
female dragonborn, bronze-scaled, but in the age
they're starting to turn a bit green at the edges,

01:05:31.614 --> 01:05:37.933
kind of patinaed a little. She sits there in the
rocking chair, hands kind of crossed on the chest,

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:39.603
just rocking and looking at you as you enter.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:44.073
TALIESIN: It's a nice place you got here.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:49.801
MATT: "Thank you very much. Welcome to Suvo's
Secrets."

01:05:49.801 --> 01:05:51.415
LAURA: Are you Suvo?

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:53.032
MATT: "Yes. Who are you?"

01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:54.362
LAURA: I am Jester.

01:05:54.362 --> 01:05:58.804
MATT: "Jester. What are you looking for that I
might be helping you with?"

01:05:58.804 --> 01:06:00.465
TALIESIN and LAURA: Secrets.

01:06:00.465 --> 01:06:03.278
LAURA: And diamonds, probably.

01:06:03.278 --> 01:06:05.827
TALIESIN: Oh, and what else? It was diamonds.
Diamonds and secrets. Secret diamonds.

01:06:05.827 --> 01:06:11.765
MATT: She leans forward and her hands hit the
front of her knees. Leaning back, she looks very

01:06:11.765 --> 01:06:15.598
small, but once she steps into the little bit of
light that's coming through the front of the tent,

01:06:15.598 --> 01:06:22.000
Suvo's a fairly large dragonborn, and, even just
leaning forward sitting, is almost as tall as you

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.071
are, Jester.

01:06:23.071 --> 01:06:24.213
LAURA: Whoa!

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.216
MATT: "Diamonds, you say?"

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:27.315
LAURA: Yes.

01:06:27.315 --> 01:06:31.165
MATT: "How many diamonds are you looking for?"

01:06:31.165 --> 01:06:33.078
LAURA: How many do you have?

01:06:33.078 --> 01:06:36.417
MATT: "Maybe 12."

01:06:36.417 --> 01:06:37.862
TALIESIN: That's a lot of diamonds.

01:06:37.862 --> 01:06:41.055
LAURA: That sounds like a lot of diamonds. Are
they big diamonds or little diamonds? I don't know.

01:06:41.055 --> 01:06:45.211
MATT: She reaches back and there's this large-- It
looks just like a sack. Just a general sack and

01:06:45.211 --> 01:06:49.300
she reaches and grabs the edge and scoots it over
without breaking eye contact. It scrapes across

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:54.297
the ground and you hear things clattering around
inside, like she's carrying a large pouch of

01:06:54.297 --> 01:07:03.523
various pots and pans. She reaches in, still
looking at you. "One."

01:07:03.523 --> 01:07:05.597
LAURA: Oh, Caleb should be here right now!

01:07:05.597 --> 01:07:11.872
MATT: "Two." And eventually counts out 12
varying-sized diamonds. They all look-- Some are

01:07:11.872 --> 01:07:16.409
cut, it looks like one of them is a little rough,
and just hasn't been cut by a jeweler yet. But,

01:07:16.409 --> 01:07:19.452
sure enough, they're--

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.234
LAURA: We can tell they're really diamonds?

01:07:21.234 --> 01:07:23.037
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:07:23.037 --> 01:07:26.068
LIAM: Your Laura is showing.

01:07:26.068 --> 01:07:28.903
LAURA: Well, just making sure she's not ripping us
off.

01:07:28.903 --> 01:07:30.619
TALIESIN: I'll join you in this perception check.

01:07:30.619 --> 01:07:36.251
LAURA: Okay. Ooh, that's good. Perception. 20.

01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:37.758
TALIESIN: 14.

01:07:37.758 --> 01:07:40.971
LAURA: I've seen a lot of diamonds in my day.

01:07:40.971 --> 01:07:44.149
MATT: You have. You've seen some fine jewelry,
especially from your mother's chests.

01:07:44.149 --> 01:07:47.503
TRAVIS: Yeah, her chests. Sorry.

01:07:47.503 --> 01:07:49.963
LAURA: There's lots of diamonds right in here.

01:07:49.963 --> 01:07:51.761
MATT: (laughing) It's the tassels.

01:07:51.761 --> 01:07:54.799
(laughter)

01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:56.458
TALIESIN: So many carats! So many carats!

01:07:56.458 --> 01:08:00.089
MATT: (whoosh, whoosh, whoosh) It's sharp and
dangerous.

01:08:00.089 --> 01:08:01.362
TALIESIN: Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:08:01.362 --> 01:08:04.157
LIAM: (singing) Best lay ever.

01:08:04.157 --> 01:08:10.187
TALIESIN: Ahh! Ahh! I'm cut, I'm cut!

01:08:10.187 --> 01:08:11.487
(laughter)

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:12.542
SAM: Children. We're all children.

01:08:12.542 --> 01:08:13.325
MATT: Yeah, we are.

01:08:13.325 --> 01:08:14.275
LIAM: That's why we're here.

01:08:14.275 --> 01:08:15.198
MATT: Exactly!

01:08:15.198 --> 01:08:16.324
LIAM: This is serious.

01:08:16.324 --> 01:08:21.989
MATT: These are all legitimate diamonds with
varying degrees of worth. But looking at the

01:08:21.989 --> 01:08:27.291
batch, there's probably about 700-- We'll say,
rounded off, about-- Roughly 750 gold worth of

01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:29.400
diamonds of the group, that she set.

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.664
TALIESIN: 600. About 600 will do both of us.

01:08:31.664 --> 01:08:37.515
LAURA: Yeah, so we'll buy all but, you know,
these two little ones. Because those probably add

01:08:37.515 --> 01:08:38.938
up to about 150.

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.790
MATT: "That is all right. They will still be here
when you come back."

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:41.917
LAURA: Okay.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:44.646
MATT: Drops them into the satchel, pushes it away.
(creaking, thumping)

01:08:44.646 --> 01:08:47.734
LAURA: I'll do 300 and you do 300?

01:08:47.734 --> 01:08:49.216
TALIESIN: Yeah, that works for me.

01:08:49.216 --> 01:08:51.398
MATT: So you each have 300 gold worth of diamonds on
you.

01:08:51.398 --> 01:08:55.695
LAURA: Okie dokie. Oh! Is there anything else in
here? Because this seems like a really cool shop.

01:08:55.695 --> 01:08:58.123
Is there anything else that I want?

01:08:58.123 --> 01:08:59.742
MATT: "There are many things."

01:08:59.742 --> 01:09:01.897
SAM: (whispering) Secrets!

01:09:01.897 --> 01:09:03.732
MATT: Grabs and pulls the sack back over.

01:09:03.732 --> 01:09:06.207
LAURA: Does she just have the sack? The one bag in
the shop?

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:07.986
MATT: Yeah. The tables are all empty.

01:09:07.986 --> 01:09:09.786
LAURA: (laughing) That's so cool!

01:09:09.786 --> 01:09:12.092
MATT: There is just a sack where she keeps all of
the goods.

01:09:12.092 --> 01:09:15.150
TALIESIN: All of her secrets! Oh, I get it now!
That's great!

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:22.593
MATT: Reaches in and pulls out what looks to be a
mummified creature's hand. You can't-- It's not

01:09:22.593 --> 01:09:31.697
quite humanoid, it's got fur on it. Sets it down.
"This is a treated owlbear matron hand."

01:09:31.697 --> 01:09:34.687
TALIESIN: I don't know what that is, but that's
really cool.

01:09:34.687 --> 01:09:35.991
LAURA: Wow!

01:09:35.991 --> 01:09:38.109
MATT: "25 gold. It's a good keepsake."

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:39.558
LAURA: Okay.

01:09:39.558 --> 01:09:49.043
MATT: Reaches in, pulls out a big batch of garlic.
Just a big old batch of garlic in a small netted

01:09:49.043 --> 01:09:57.244
sack. She goes, "Garlic. Good for cooking and also
for keeping away... <i>vampyr</i>!"

01:09:57.244 --> 01:10:00.134
(laughter)

01:10:00.134 --> 01:10:06.463
LAURA: You know what we could do? Get the garlic,
sprinkle the Dust of Deliciousness on the garlic,

01:10:06.463 --> 01:10:08.320
and feed it to the <i>vampyr</i>!

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.272
TALIESIN: Then they'd be in pain and very
susceptible to--

01:10:11.272 --> 01:10:13.048
MATT: Make a religion check, Jester.

01:10:13.048 --> 01:10:17.866
LAURA: Would I know this stuff? A natural one!

01:10:17.866 --> 01:10:23.001
MATT: This plan sounds perfectly sound.

01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:25.034
(laughter)

01:10:25.034 --> 01:10:28.596
TALIESIN: I want to see what else is in the sack
before-- We shouldn't negotiate until we know

01:10:28.596 --> 01:10:29.405
everything.

01:10:29.405 --> 01:10:30.308
LAURA: Yeah, this is true.

01:10:30.308 --> 01:10:31.454
MATT: So, for the sake of brevity--

01:10:31.454 --> 01:10:32.556
TALIESIN: For the sake of brevity.

01:10:32.556 --> 01:10:35.560
MATT: It's a whole slew of strange knickknacks--

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.205
LAURA: And we sit there while she pulls out the
entire bag.

01:10:38.205 --> 01:10:43.736
MATT: Yeah, it takes the better part of 30 or 40
minutes or so. There's an iron mask. Where the

01:10:43.736 --> 01:10:50.492
mouth should be, it's just these two metal tusks
that stick out, almost like a cast-iron orc mask.

01:10:50.492 --> 01:10:52.009
MARISHA: (whispering) Russell Crowe!

01:10:52.009 --> 01:10:54.929
(laughter)

01:10:54.929 --> 01:10:56.564
TRAVIS: Are you not entertained!?

01:10:56.564 --> 01:11:02.835
MATT: Oh my god. There are-- There's half of a
chess set carved from jade. When I say half, I

01:11:02.835 --> 01:11:09.425
mean not like one side or the other: half of each
side, so it's completely useless. There is a

01:11:09.425 --> 01:11:15.374
single vial that has a familiar, red, medicinal
liquid in it. It looks like there is a healing

01:11:15.374 --> 01:11:23.877
potion, should you be so inclined to purchase it.
And the rest of it is just absolute junk.

01:11:23.877 --> 01:11:26.337
TALIESIN: I'll take the garlic.

01:11:26.337 --> 01:11:34.242
MATT: "Very well. Two gold." Which is really
expensive for fucking garlic.

01:11:34.242 --> 01:11:38.571
TALIESIN: I'm thinking, that's-- One gold.

01:11:38.571 --> 01:11:40.496
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:42.745
SAM: One gold?

01:11:42.745 --> 01:11:44.205
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:11:44.205 --> 01:11:46.398
SAM: Hardcore negotiations.

01:11:46.398 --> 01:11:47.688
TALIESIN: Ah, 20.

01:11:47.688 --> 01:11:51.259
MATT: "It is yours."

01:11:51.259 --> 01:11:53.992
SAM: (whispering) Secrets!

01:11:53.992 --> 01:11:55.955
MARISHA: That's still overpriced for garlic.

01:11:55.955 --> 01:11:57.808
MATT: It's so overpriced for garlic.

01:11:57.808 --> 01:12:00.244
LAURA: How much is the healing potion?

01:12:00.244 --> 01:12:06.695
TALIESIN: It's <i>good</i> garlic. Never can pay too--
Yeah, it's really nice garlic.

01:12:06.695 --> 01:12:07.963
LIAM: Heirloom. Artisinal.

01:12:07.963 --> 01:12:09.585
MATT: It is actually pretty artisanal garlic.

01:12:09.585 --> 01:12:11.022
TALIESIN: Artisanal garlic.

01:12:11.022 --> 01:12:12.350
TRAVIS: It came out of the ground.

01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:17.820
MATT: All right, so yeah. This would be a greater
healing potion.

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:18.823
SAM: Ooh!

01:12:18.823 --> 01:12:20.485
LAURA: Oh, that's expensive.

01:12:20.485 --> 01:12:22.452
TRAVIS: Maybe not from her.

01:12:22.452 --> 01:12:23.450
TALIESIN: Ask.

01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:25.522
MARISHA: She just charged two gold for garlic.

01:12:25.522 --> 01:12:36.319
MATT: No. For this, she's like, "This will run 250
gold pieces. But it will keep you from dying in

01:12:36.319 --> 01:12:39.659
"places where you will probably most likely be
dying."

01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:44.719
LAURA: Wow. I would take it, but I don't have
enough gold.

01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:48.114
MATT: Pulls it back and puts it back in the
satchel. "Then you will not have it!"

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:51.974
LAURA: Okay.

01:12:51.974 --> 01:12:57.952
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold out the garlic one
more time. Just checking. Seems legit.

01:12:57.952 --> 01:13:00.792
MATT: (laughing) She seems to nod like, "Well
done."

01:13:00.792 --> 01:13:02.014
LAURA: Oh, I did that wrong.

01:13:02.014 --> 01:13:02.890
SAM: Yes, you did.

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:08.058
LAURA: It was because I was listening to what he
was saying. I was distracted. There we go. Okay.

01:13:08.058 --> 01:13:10.930
MATT: "No mask?"

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:12.678
LAURA: How much for the mask?

01:13:12.678 --> 01:13:14.028
TALIESIN: You don't know where that's been.

01:13:14.028 --> 01:13:15.364
LAURA: I know.

01:13:15.364 --> 01:13:17.414
MATT: Five gold.

01:13:17.414 --> 01:13:22.027
LAURA: Ah. Ooh. Three gold!

01:13:22.027 --> 01:13:25.877
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:13:25.877 --> 01:13:30.484
LAURA: No! Er, seven!

01:13:30.484 --> 01:13:32.660
MATT: Five gold.

01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.774
LAURA: Deal.

01:13:33.774 --> 01:13:42.515
MATT: "Be careful. They say the curse lasts for
whoever-- I don't remember the rest of it. It's

01:13:42.515 --> 01:13:47.166
"just a mask, there's no enchantment. It's just a
very scary mask. But congratulations, it's yours."

01:13:47.166 --> 01:13:48.946
TRAVIS: Just bailed.

01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:51.614
(laughter)

01:13:51.614 --> 01:13:52.855
MARISHA: It's all bullshit.

01:13:52.855 --> 01:13:57.144
MATT: It's all bullshit. Well, most of it's
bullshit from this individual.

01:13:57.144 --> 01:13:58.536
LAURA: Okay.

01:13:58.536 --> 01:14:00.558
MATT: "Very well. Is that the end of it?"

01:14:00.558 --> 01:14:01.935
LAURA: I think so.

01:14:01.935 --> 01:14:04.796
TALIESIN: I feel very satisfied with this entire
expedition.

01:14:04.796 --> 01:14:11.624
MATT: "Be safe and come back again. I am very
interested to sell to you what else might come my way."

01:14:11.624 --> 01:14:12.789
LAURA: Thank you, Suvos.

01:14:12.789 --> 01:14:16.929
LIAM: (whispering) Shallots! Chives!

01:14:16.929 --> 01:14:23.120
MATT: You step out. The bright light of the midday
sun-- The clouds of the previous storm have parted

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.806
a bit and there's actually bright light and your
eyes have to adjust. You're like, "Aah, Ah! Ah."

01:14:26.806 --> 01:14:35.656
TALIESIN: I'm perfectly satisfied with my shopping
experience.

01:14:35.656 --> 01:14:37.994
LAURA: I'm done with my shopping. All of my money
is gone.

01:14:37.994 --> 01:14:46.375
MATT: All right. Who else? We've done a few things
with you guys. We've done Nott's stuff. Fjord,

01:14:46.375 --> 01:14:47.583
anything you want to do?

01:14:47.583 --> 01:15:03.816
TRAVIS: Sure. Yeah. The previous events have
rocked Fjord a little bit. Are there any bars or

01:15:03.816 --> 01:15:11.876
taverns in Zadash that may house frequent sailors
or people of trade, merchants?

01:15:11.876 --> 01:15:16.734
MATT: Sailors, not so much. The Empire is
landlocked aside from the very far north, and

01:15:16.734 --> 01:15:24.652
those waters are in the frigid depths. It's a lot
of ice floes and treacherous water up there. So

01:15:24.688 --> 01:15:29.946
there is very little passage up north. The
Menagerie Coast, as you know, is where all of the

01:15:29.946 --> 01:15:36.291
port towns are, and that's the relationship
between the Empire and The Menagerie Coast. That

01:15:36.291 --> 01:15:40.733
agreement is based on the fact that, essentially,
the Menagerie Coast holds all the long-term

01:15:40.733 --> 01:15:43.203
imports and exports in the palm of their hand.

01:15:43.203 --> 01:15:51.893
TRAVIS: I know that I've made that trip. How far
is it from Zadash back to the northernmost part of

01:15:51.893 --> 01:15:53.100
the Menagerie Coast?

01:15:53.100 --> 01:16:01.329
MATT: That would be Nicodranas. Nicodranas from
Zadash, it's a little over a week to get there,

01:16:01.329 --> 01:16:02.804
I'd say.

01:16:02.804 --> 01:16:11.689
TRAVIS: (sighs) I think Fjord's going to take a
steed and start heading south by himself.

01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:14.435
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:16:14.435 --> 01:16:15.893
SAM: What? He's going on walkabout?

01:16:15.893 --> 01:16:17.207
MARISHA: He's going on a walkabout.

01:16:17.207 --> 01:16:30.391
TRAVIS: While he heads south, I'd like to adopt
various disguises as I stop in inns, taverns,

01:16:30.391 --> 01:16:40.440
places of trade, and carefully hear if anyone is
mentioning the name "Sabian," if people are

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:47.206
talking about ships, and try and casually make my
way further south, knowing that I have an amount

01:16:47.206 --> 01:16:51.552
of time to get back north. I'd like to try to make
my way down and see what I can hear and find out.

01:16:51.552 --> 01:17:00.304
MATT: Okay. Make three successive investigation
checks for me, please.

01:17:00.304 --> 01:17:12.920
TRAVIS: Okay. 12, nine, and a six.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:24.033
MATT: You make it as far south as Trostenwald
before the frustration wells up inside you. It's

01:17:24.033 --> 01:17:31.288
been a series of dead ends. You've asked around
and listened, and anyone who would've crossed

01:17:31.288 --> 01:17:36.738
paths with some of the shipping lanes that you're
familiar with and that Sabian was familiar with,

01:17:36.738 --> 01:17:43.651
none of them are passing this far north. You
assume that to continue this, you would have to go

01:17:43.651 --> 01:17:50.191
to the Menagerie Coast, and that would involve a
thorough passage through Nicodranas and the

01:17:50.191 --> 01:17:56.693
various wharf taverns and seeing what old
connections you might be able to dredge up in that

01:17:56.693 --> 01:17:59.322
time, but that's going to take you a little
while.

01:17:59.322 --> 01:18:04.519
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think I'll make it to the end of
that week and start to make my way back.

01:18:04.519 --> 01:18:12.037
MATT: By the end of the week, you'll get not quite
to Nicodranas. If you want to, you can traverse

01:18:12.037 --> 01:18:16.444
the Wuyun Gorge, pass through the Wuyun Gates, and
head into the Menagerie Coast. You will be alone,

01:18:16.444 --> 01:18:21.970
and it isn't a not-dangerous road. So just be
aware. There are some possibilities.

01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:28.944
TRAVIS: No, I know now that the strength is in the
numbers of the group. I'll stop and head back.

01:18:28.944 --> 01:18:29.816
MATT: You sure?

01:18:29.816 --> 01:18:30.673
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:40.716
MATT: Okay. After this unfortunately not-fruitful
travel south in seeking out any possible word of

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:47.553
Sabian, you shift your attention back and decide
to rally with your allies. Perhaps that's the

01:18:47.553 --> 01:18:52.136
direction you want to go in the future. Okay, what
else would you like to do?

01:18:52.136 --> 01:18:54.629
TRAVIS: That's about it.

01:18:54.629 --> 01:19:00.799
MATT: Okay. Very well. Anybody else?

01:19:00.799 --> 01:19:08.690
LIAM: Yeah, if that invitation was good and I have
about, as she said, the next day, Caleb's going to

01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:16.787
pull an all-nighter. I'm going to spend time in a
hotel room, an inn, and take the lucky rock and

01:19:16.787 --> 01:19:28.545
I'm going to fill it with transmutative power and
make a Transmuter's Stone out of it, and for now

01:19:28.545 --> 01:19:37.482
we will have it let me see in the dark. For now. I
would also transcribe every spell that was in the

01:19:37.482 --> 01:19:43.752
book and every scroll that I have found so that I
use up all the paper that I have purchased. Have

01:19:43.752 --> 01:19:47.709
every spell. And Frumpkin is back. As a cat.

01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:50.673
MATT: All righty. Cat Frumpkin has returned.

01:19:50.673 --> 01:19:57.357
LIAM: There is only one Frumpkin. I stayed up all
night doing all of those things because they're

01:19:57.401 --> 01:20:04.899
very time-intensive and would have went to find
Beauregard, very tired and ready to go, to stay at

01:20:04.899 --> 01:20:11.969
the library as long as I am able. She said a
number of days, and when those days are up, the

01:20:11.969 --> 01:20:18.645
thing that I would do is spend as much time that
is left with the-- I would borrow Jester's

01:20:18.645 --> 01:20:24.174
haversack, if she would let me, and spend time
with the dodecahedron.

01:20:24.174 --> 01:20:29.972
MATT: Okay. We'll get to that. First, you guys
make your way to the archive and you enter there,

01:20:29.972 --> 01:20:38.273
and the following morning Caleb is very
tired-looking, but also hard to tell.

01:20:38.273 --> 01:20:41.350
MARISHA: 'Sup, man! You ready for this monk
retreat? Monk retreat!

01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:45.563
LIAM: I want to learn all of the martial arts.

01:20:45.563 --> 01:20:48.888
MARISHA: Let's go.

01:20:48.888 --> 01:20:55.484
MATT: Making your way into the archive, it's
fairly bustling in comparison to what you know.

01:20:55.484 --> 01:20:58.748
It's either dead or there's a handful of people
going through it. Today it's a handful of people

01:20:58.748 --> 01:21:02.943
going through. You're like, "Oh wow, there's four
people in here researching right now."

01:21:02.943 --> 01:21:06.313
MARISHA: No one ever cares about books this much.
It's weird.

01:21:06.313 --> 01:21:11.464
MATT: Within a short time-- what are you looking
to do, Beauregard?

01:21:11.464 --> 01:21:17.637
MARISHA: I ask around and see if Dairon is there.

01:21:17.637 --> 01:21:24.431
MATT: One of the monks goes, "Let me go inquire.
I'll be right back," and wanders up the stairs.

01:21:24.431 --> 01:21:32.299
You see them descend the stairs with another
figure. Gray robes with blue lining, hood pulled

01:21:32.299 --> 01:21:34.177
back, and there you see Zeenoth.

01:21:34.177 --> 01:21:35.484
MARISHA: Oh.

01:21:35.484 --> 01:21:40.934
MATT: He steps down and goes, "Beauregard. I
wasn't aware you had returned."

01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:42.529
MARISHA: Hi.

01:21:42.529 --> 01:21:47.465
MATT: "Hi. Dairon, unfortunately, is still out on
the front lines."

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:48.783
MARISHA: What?

01:21:48.783 --> 01:22:00.279
MATT: "Well, she's been sent to assess political
threats beyond the eastern border. Been gone for

01:22:00.279 --> 01:22:06.726
"about 30 days and is said to return in the next 45
before we send anyone after her. But I'm sure

01:22:06.726 --> 01:22:08.066
"she's fine."

01:22:08.066 --> 01:22:11.207
MARISHA: She said she'd be back within a month,
that she was just checking out the front lines at

01:22:11.207 --> 01:22:12.303
Bladegarden.

01:22:12.303 --> 01:22:17.380
MATT: "Well, things change when they're at that
moment of conflict."

01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:19.429
MARISHA: You sent her behind enemy lines?

01:22:19.429 --> 01:22:23.656
MATT: "No. She progressed behind enemy lines and
then wrote to us that she was staying for an

01:22:23.656 --> 01:22:30.330
"extended period. She's impetuous. I think you may
know something about that. Anyway, I'm sorry

01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:34.701
"Dairon is not here. What are you inquiring
about?"

01:22:34.701 --> 01:22:40.306
MARISHA: Just hoping to check in with her and
catch up on some coaching.

01:22:40.306 --> 01:22:49.898
MATT: "Ah. Well, there is Tubo. Tubo is quite an
accomplished monk of the Cobalt Soul and might be

01:22:49.949 --> 01:22:52.054
"able to help you, whereas Dairon could not."

01:22:52.054 --> 01:22:53.518
MARISHA: Do I know Tubo?

01:22:53.518 --> 01:23:01.156
MATT: You've seen Tubo. You've not directly
interacted, because Tubo, much like Dairon, works

01:23:01.156 --> 01:23:06.145
on a higher level. You hadn't quite garnished the
attention beyond just being "that brat" for a

01:23:06.145 --> 01:23:18.033
while. Tubo is this very dark-skinned halfling
with very short, widow's peak-type hair, and this

01:23:18.033 --> 01:23:24.100
very calm smile about him. Very well-respected,
but you haven't really seen him move or do

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:29.171
anything other than walking through the archive
and be present.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.002
MARISHA: Is he an expositor?

01:23:31.086 --> 01:23:32.793
MATT: You don't know.

01:23:32.793 --> 01:23:37.544
MARISHA: Hmm. Yeah, all right.

01:23:37.544 --> 01:23:41.168
MATT: "All right. I shall return. Good seeing you
again."

01:23:41.168 --> 01:23:42.935
MARISHA: Yeah, you too.

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:50.841
MATT: Zeenoth's patient smile fades as he turns.
Within a short time, you see coming from down the

01:23:50.841 --> 01:24:01.048
same staircase, Tubo, his arms folded in front of
him as he descends and turns toward you. "So you

01:24:01.048 --> 01:24:03.414
"are Beauregard, correct?"

01:24:03.414 --> 01:24:04.855
MARISHA: That's me.

01:24:04.855 --> 01:24:10.044
MATT: "And you're looking for training while your
expositor is away, correct?"

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:13.712
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean--

01:24:13.712 --> 01:24:15.301
MATT: "Follow me."

01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:19.511
MARISHA: Okay. Also, I got this guy with me. Can
he get a room and a library pass?

01:24:19.511 --> 01:24:27.467
MATT: Zeenoth, who's a little bit behind, goes,
"I'll accompany him in his reading, if that's all right?"

01:24:27.467 --> 01:24:30.072
MARISHA: Zeenoth, Caleb. Caleb, Zeenoth.

01:24:30.072 --> 01:24:31.876
MATT: "We've met, in Trostenwald."

01:24:31.876 --> 01:24:33.108
LIAM: <i>Hallo</i>.

01:24:33.108 --> 01:24:36.144
MATT: "Hello. Please, lead the way to where you'd
wish to read."

01:24:36.144 --> 01:24:39.706
LIAM: Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:24:39.706 --> 01:24:40.916
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:24:40.916 --> 01:24:47.114
MATT: All right. Tubo brings you to a chamber you
haven't been in in a while, which is the formal

01:24:47.114 --> 01:24:53.224
training grounds beneath the archive. There is a
set of double doors in the far end that blend in

01:24:53.224 --> 01:24:59.224
mostly with the dark wood that a lot of the bookcases
are crafted out of. It leads you down a set of

01:24:59.224 --> 01:25:05.788
stairs into what is essentially a training pit
with very heavily packed sand and dirt, and there

01:25:05.788 --> 01:25:14.630
are a number of wooden poles that emerge from
beneath that have all sorts of skewed extensions.

01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:21.476
This is where a lot of forms are practiced and a
lot of defensive maneuvers are utilized. You were

01:25:21.476 --> 01:25:27.221
brought through in this area for training in waves
time and again, but it's been a while since you've

01:25:27.221 --> 01:25:31.764
been down here, since you've been abroad, and
there's no other people there training currently.

01:25:31.764 --> 01:25:43.777
Tubo brings you down. "Very well. Show me what
you've got." For the sake of brevity--

01:25:43.777 --> 01:25:45.992
SAM: You die.

01:25:45.992 --> 01:25:54.557
MATT: Yes. Roll up a new character. Tubo splatters
you across the wall. You spar for a bit, showing

01:25:54.557 --> 01:26:01.343
him the limits of your capabilities, and he's
deftly, with a smile on his face, dodging,

01:26:01.343 --> 01:26:09.591
parrying. You get a few good hits in and he backs
away. "Very good," and then begins to overwhelm

01:26:09.591 --> 01:26:14.434
you with his assault, but never enough to inflict
pain, just enough to throw you off your guard

01:26:14.434 --> 01:26:21.802
until a moment he turns around and puts his hands
up into a cross once more and goes, "Four days. I

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:23.438
"need four days with you."

01:26:23.438 --> 01:26:28.213
MARISHA: Okay. And then what happens?

01:26:28.213 --> 01:26:31.515
MATT: "And then your training for now is
complete."

01:26:31.515 --> 01:26:33.526
MARISHA: Yeah, all right.

01:26:33.526 --> 01:26:37.785
MATT: "Day one begins. Time to read."

01:26:37.785 --> 01:26:38.758
MARISHA: What?!

01:26:38.758 --> 01:26:43.701
MATT: He takes you back upstairs and begins to
collect books and throw them into a pile and sits

01:26:43.701 --> 01:26:45.026
you down.

01:26:45.026 --> 01:26:53.293
MARISHA: I look at Caleb across the library.

01:26:53.293 --> 01:26:58.888
MATT: You begin reading and it's getting
frustrated, but as you're reading, Tubo begins to

01:26:58.888 --> 01:27:06.241
lean in and say, "As you're reading, think
carefully about what you're trying to find. What

01:27:06.241 --> 01:27:07.852
"you're trying to learn."

01:27:07.852 --> 01:27:11.484
MARISHA: Okay, what am I trying to learn?

01:27:11.484 --> 01:27:14.525
MATT: What are you looking to research?

01:27:14.525 --> 01:27:26.009
MARISHA: Is there any type of history on families
of Wildemount, or any type of underground trade

01:27:26.009 --> 01:27:30.977
going on? Family trees? Connections?

01:27:30.977 --> 01:27:36.363
MATT: For the portion of this day, Tubo begins to
instruct you on how to not just read and research,

01:27:36.363 --> 01:27:44.107
but in focusing your spiritual energy on the
specific things you're searching, you begin to

01:27:44.107 --> 01:27:50.643
find quick ways to Johnny 5 through tomes to find
what you're looking for. With this comes your

01:27:50.643 --> 01:27:55.232
ability to spend a ki point to gain advantage on
an investigation check.

01:27:55.232 --> 01:27:56.681
MARISHA: Dope.

01:27:56.681 --> 01:28:01.293
MATT: Day two comes around and he brings you down
to the subterranean chamber for more training.

01:28:01.293 --> 01:28:09.543
This time, he begins to show you how to use that
same internal, spiritual energy or ki at the

01:28:09.543 --> 01:28:17.083
moment of impact to give off this very localized
wave of spiritual energy. He begins to tell you

01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:23.018
how, "This can break through defenses of things
that are meant to not be touched with a mortal

01:28:23.018 --> 01:28:33.801
"hand. This is intended as a way to bypass
sometimes the mundane protections." Through this

01:28:33.801 --> 01:28:38.112
training, he teaches you how use your empowered
strikes, where now your physical fists and attacks

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:40.243
as a monk are considered magical.

01:28:40.243 --> 01:28:41.723
MARISHA: Ghost puncher.

01:28:41.723 --> 01:28:43.111
MATT: Yes, you can now punch ghosts.

01:28:43.111 --> 01:28:44.594
MARISHA: Sick.

01:28:44.594 --> 01:28:50.664
MATT: Day three, he brings you down to the chamber
with a chair, and says, "Sit."

01:28:50.664 --> 01:28:52.572
MARISHA: Okay.

01:28:52.572 --> 01:28:59.036
MATT: "Tell me. Tell me a secret."

01:28:59.036 --> 01:29:00.700
MARISHA: Is this Truth or Dare?

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.995
MATT: "Kind of. Do you want to tell me a secret?"

01:29:02.995 --> 01:29:05.039
MARISHA: Is there a dare option?

01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:06.065
MATT: "No."

01:29:06.065 --> 01:29:10.910
MARISHA: Then it's not Truth or Dare. You know
Truth or Dare, right?

01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:17.328
MATT: He looks frustrated, turns around, does a
little loop, comes back, and as you're about to

01:29:17.328 --> 01:29:22.711
speak up again, he does a series of quick hits
that hurt a little, but that catch you right in

01:29:22.711 --> 01:29:28.405
the clavicle, the side of throat, and then right
under the chin. As you pull back, make a saving

01:29:28.405 --> 01:29:33.010
throw for me, please. This would be a charisma
saving throw, I believe.

01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:38.008
MARISHA: 12. Not good.

01:29:38.008 --> 01:29:46.102
MATT: He begins to ask you questions about your
youth and your family history-- things you don't

01:29:46.102 --> 01:29:51.712
normally talk about with anybody. Outside of
stopping yourself from speaking at all, you're on

01:29:51.712 --> 01:29:57.485
the verge of constantly giving up the information.
He teaches you, "This is a technique that allows

01:29:57.485 --> 01:30:05.937
"you to pull the truth from those that would not be
so forthcoming. It is situationally very useful,

01:30:05.937 --> 01:30:11.241
"and I will show this to you." And so he teaches
you the Extort Truth ability. On the fourth and final

01:30:11.241 --> 01:30:20.422
day, he leads you down and begins to show you how
to use your ki capabilities, your spiritual

01:30:20.422 --> 01:30:30.239
energy, to blend it with moments of adrenaline
bursts to give yourself a moment of reactionary

01:30:30.239 --> 01:30:36.406
time where previously you would have expended any
capability of preparing yourself for an assault.

01:30:36.406 --> 01:30:42.042
As he puts you through hours of this rigorous
training, he goes, "Very well. The time to show

01:30:42.091 --> 01:30:53.579
"what you can do has come." Claps. You watch as two
other monks come down. (laughs) But they have bows

01:30:53.579 --> 01:31:00.697
and arrows, and they have a third one they hand to
him. They all nock the arrows and aim them right

01:31:00.697 --> 01:31:01.632
at you.

01:31:01.632 --> 01:31:03.103
SAM: Tubo versus Beau with bows!

01:31:03.103 --> 01:31:05.086
(laughter)

01:31:05.086 --> 01:31:06.979
LIAM: Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo.

01:31:06.979 --> 01:31:11.377
MARISHA: That's deeply accurate.

01:31:11.377 --> 01:31:27.294
MATT: Yeah. Tubo goes, "Fire." All three arrows
come toward you. That's a 19 to hit.

01:31:27.294 --> 01:31:29.920
MARISHA: 19 just hits.

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:38.024
MATT: Okay. That's another 19, actually. And that
is a 23. So all three hit you.

01:31:38.024 --> 01:31:39.601
TRAVIS: Jesus. Fuck your bracers.

01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:41.892
MARISHA: (groaning)

01:31:41.892 --> 01:31:44.595
TRAVIS: I got new shit! (impacts)

01:31:44.595 --> 01:31:48.086
MARISHA: I'm Wonder Woman! I'm not Wonder Woman.

01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:50.614
MATT: The first arrow is ten points of damage.

01:31:50.614 --> 01:31:51.805
MARISHA: Can I do the thing?

01:31:51.805 --> 01:31:52.824
MATT: Yes, you can.

01:31:52.824 --> 01:31:58.701
MARISHA: Spend a ki point. How many points of
damage?

01:31:58.701 --> 01:31:59.896
MATT: Ten.

01:31:59.896 --> 01:32:01.264
MARISHA: Ten? No points of damage.

01:32:01.264 --> 01:32:02.562
MATT: You catch one arrow.

01:32:02.562 --> 01:32:05.575
MARISHA: Wait, I'm level six now, right?

01:32:05.575 --> 01:32:06.375
MATT: Correct.

01:32:06.375 --> 01:32:07.513
MARISHA: One point of damage. I lied.

01:32:07.513 --> 01:32:10.476
MATT: Okay. You take one point of damage. You just
barely catch it. It manages to nick the side of

01:32:10.476 --> 01:32:11.712
your shoulder.

01:32:11.712 --> 01:32:13.080
MARISHA: Okay.

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:15.033
MATT: The two other arrows are coming at you as
well.

01:32:15.033 --> 01:32:20.017
MARISHA: I can only do this thing once though,
right? Or I can keep spending ki points to do

01:32:20.017 --> 01:32:21.814
that, right? I'll do it one more time.

01:32:21.814 --> 01:32:25.012
MATT: Okay, you can do that now, if you have
another reaction.

01:32:25.012 --> 01:32:31.503
MARISHA: That's right, which I do.

01:32:31.503 --> 01:32:34.296
TALIESIN: You have multiple reactions?

01:32:34.296 --> 01:32:35.742
MARISHA: I do now.

01:32:35.742 --> 01:32:36.722
SAM: What?!

01:32:36.722 --> 01:32:38.077
LAURA: Everybody, be a monk.

01:32:38.077 --> 01:32:39.121
TALIESIN: What?!

01:32:39.121 --> 01:32:43.757
MARISHA: If I spend a ki point. One, two.

01:32:43.757 --> 01:32:49.294
MATT: You don't have to spend a ki point to reduce
the damage. You spend a ki point to throw it back.

01:32:49.294 --> 01:32:53.152
MARISHA: So I will spend an extra reaction, then,
to catch the other one.

01:32:53.152 --> 01:32:59.641
MATT: You spend the same ki point. Roll for damage
reduction on the next one. That's 12 points of

01:32:59.641 --> 01:33:01.149
damage.

01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:03.179
MARISHA: I rolled 11, so another one point of
damage.

01:33:03.179 --> 01:33:05.715
MATT: You catch both arrows. The third one is
coming towards you.

01:33:05.715 --> 01:33:07.370
MARISHA: And one more.

01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:11.777
MATT: Spend another ki point. That's two ki points
now. You get to roll to reduce the third one.

01:33:11.777 --> 01:33:14.825
MARISHA: 12.

01:33:14.825 --> 01:33:19.298
MATT: Yeah, that one does no damage. You catch one
arrow out of the air. It just barely nicks your

01:33:19.298 --> 01:33:24.067
shoulder. The other one you catch just as it
scrapes past the side of your arm. The third one

01:33:24.067 --> 01:33:27.869
you catch in the middle of the air with no impact.
In the blink of an eye, you've deflected all three

01:33:27.869 --> 01:33:29.548
arrows shot at the same time.

01:33:29.548 --> 01:33:33.973
MARISHA: I turn to Tubo and I go: Did you see
that?!

01:33:33.973 --> 01:33:37.574
MATT: "I did. And with that, your training is
complete."

01:33:37.574 --> 01:33:40.989
MARISHA: Oh. I don't get to kill those guys?

01:33:40.989 --> 01:33:47.845
MATT: "No!" He hands the shortbow to the other one
and they all head back upstairs.

01:33:47.845 --> 01:33:51.057
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm sure you're really lovely
people.

01:33:51.057 --> 01:33:55.853
MATT: "Impressive. Dairon was not wrong about
you."

01:33:55.853 --> 01:34:00.277
MARISHA: Wait, what has-- Dairon's been talking
about me? What has she been saying?

01:34:00.277 --> 01:34:08.408
MATT: "That you are an apt pupil. Now, our time is
done. I have things to do. And four days with you

01:34:08.408 --> 01:34:09.762
"has been more than enough."

01:34:09.762 --> 01:34:11.814
MARISHA: Yeah. I get that a lot.

01:34:11.814 --> 01:34:14.998
MATT: He makes his way back up and escorts you out
of the training chamber.

01:34:14.998 --> 01:34:18.200
SAM: Guys, hasn't the last four days been amazing?

01:34:18.299 --> 01:34:20.857
LAURA: Yes, really peaceful, actually.

01:34:20.857 --> 01:34:23.164
MARISHA: I go find Caleb and I go: Let's go!

01:34:23.164 --> 01:34:24.991
LAURA: Four days later.

01:34:24.991 --> 01:34:26.199
MATT: So during this time, Caleb?

01:34:26.199 --> 01:34:34.003
LIAM: If I had four days to peruse at will, I
would have spent the first day trying to research

01:34:34.003 --> 01:34:39.954
anything I could find about Xhorhas, the
Xhorasians' mentions of beacons, of them living

01:34:39.954 --> 01:34:43.988
many lives, their religion, if possible.

01:34:43.988 --> 01:34:48.205
MATT: Make an investigation check with advantage
to find all the right information.

01:34:48.205 --> 01:34:57.126
LIAM: Investigation? That is 19.

01:34:57.126 --> 01:35:06.849
MATT: So, on that specific thing, you learn about
the Kryn Dynasty, which is the Xhorhasian society

01:35:06.849 --> 01:35:12.877
that exists in the ruins of Ghor Dranas. You know
that most of them were drow, dark elf, from what

01:35:12.877 --> 01:35:18.088
you've heard and the ones you've interacted with.
Now, the drow were brethren alongside all elves in

01:35:18.088 --> 01:35:22.707
the past history until their minds were corrupted
and swayed by the terrible silver tongue of Lolth

01:35:22.707 --> 01:35:29.052
the Spider Queen, one of the Betrayer Gods. Under
her will, they became deceptive, cruel, and

01:35:29.052 --> 01:35:34.544
violent. When the Betrayer Gods were defeated and
banished during the Calamity, and the Divergence

01:35:34.544 --> 01:35:42.072
that separated the mortal realm from the gods that
once threatened to destroy it entirely, the drow

01:35:42.072 --> 01:35:47.087
returned to their subterranean cities to rebuild
their power far from the burning light of day.

01:35:47.087 --> 01:35:52.307
Much of the recent studies into current drow
society across Exandria speak of growing paranoia

01:35:52.307 --> 01:35:59.955
and madness that's seeping in with the believed
influence of Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion.

01:35:59.955 --> 01:36:07.367
Whether it be by proximity of remnants of his
power deep beneath the surface that have grown

01:36:07.367 --> 01:36:12.167
close to these societies, but there is whispers
and research that say that some of these dark elf

01:36:12.167 --> 01:36:19.338
societies are being driven slowly mad by this
influence. Strangely, what studies you've been

01:36:19.338 --> 01:36:25.920
able to find that talk about penetrating the Kryn
Dynasty's intense boundaries-- I fucking looked at

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.972
you immediately, Laura, because I knew where it
was going.

01:36:27.972 --> 01:36:33.468
LAURA: You see? You know it, too. That means you
looked at me because you knew.

01:36:33.468 --> 01:36:40.629
MATT: Of course. As soon as I read the word I was
like-- Without fail.

01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:42.267
LIAM: Pray to the great god titty.

01:36:42.267 --> 01:36:51.204
MATT: We missed you. But for those who were able
to move past the boundaries to research more of

01:36:51.204 --> 01:36:56.209
what little is known of the Kryn Dynasty, there is
little in iconography under Lolth or Tharizdun.

01:36:56.209 --> 01:37:01.896
And what remains of that is ancient and crumbling
and largely ignored by the society.

01:37:01.896 --> 01:37:10.056
LIAM: Do I find any mention of these beacons-- he
mentioned beacons, plural-- and reincarnation or

01:37:10.056 --> 01:37:11.144
multiple lives?

01:37:11.144 --> 01:37:15.134
MATT: There's nothing about beacons, nothing about
reincarnation. However, it does speak of the

01:37:15.134 --> 01:37:22.623
dynasty worshiping something other, something that
is new and dangerous as far as the Cobalt Soul is

01:37:22.623 --> 01:37:30.121
concerned, with what little research they have.
They refer to it as "The Luxon" and seek to bring

01:37:30.121 --> 01:37:37.036
all under its burning banner. They've rallied to
the surface of Ghor Dranas, casting the skies in

01:37:37.036 --> 01:37:43.054
eternal midnight that spreads with their dominion.
They've begun taking the ravenous hordes of

01:37:43.054 --> 01:37:48.824
beast-men and terrors of the Xhorhasian wastes,
and indoctrinate them under this new false god.

01:37:48.824 --> 01:37:55.664
You also learn that a number of people, mostly
children of adolescent age, have been found

01:37:55.664 --> 01:38:00.527
abducted in the night by the Kryn on occasion,
though the number has steeply grown this past

01:38:00.527 --> 01:38:07.619
generation, years after the first open conflicts
with the Kryn began. The last thing you discover

01:38:07.619 --> 01:38:14.672
is the leader of the dynasty is known as Empress
Leylas Kryn. She is called an "umavi" by them,

01:38:14.672 --> 01:38:19.920
though the word's meaning is unknown by current
research. Accounts of the Empress speak of her as

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:29.155
a powerful and dangerous warrior on the
battlefield. And well over 600 years old or more,

01:38:29.155 --> 01:38:40.050
as records date back that far since she arrived in
local history. That's what you've discovered about

01:38:40.050 --> 01:38:42.314
the Kryn Dynasty and Xhorhas.

01:38:42.314 --> 01:38:49.926
LIAM: I spend a day reading about that. I will
spend every remaining day reading about-- I was

01:38:49.926 --> 01:38:54.732
rushed the first time I came here, so I'm going to
spend every day left reading about the weave of

01:38:54.732 --> 01:38:58.447
time and any mortals' attempts to control it.

01:38:58.447 --> 01:39:00.160
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:04.448
SAM: The weave of time.

01:39:04.448 --> 01:39:08.530
TRAVIS: That's some restricted reading bullshit.

01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:09.907
LIAM: 22.

01:39:09.907 --> 01:39:15.915
MATT: The things you discover, from what's
available to you in the archive: time is a

01:39:15.915 --> 01:39:22.183
constant, the motion moving forward unyielding.
Some powerful arcane influences can accelerate or

01:39:22.183 --> 01:39:29.568
slow the rate at which time passes locally, even
stop it. There are some stories from the Age of

01:39:29.568 --> 01:39:34.517
Arcanum that speak of the greatest of sages
experimenting with reversing the forward momentum

01:39:34.517 --> 01:39:40.482
of time, and supposedly with some success. But the
process apparently was so taxing and the energies

01:39:40.482 --> 01:39:48.345
required so extensive that it nearly killed those
who passed through this natural flow. That's as

01:39:48.345 --> 01:39:53.360
much as you can pick up on the specific research
involving that shift of time. They're more

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:57.544
footnotes and like a, "We don't mess with that
because those who tried have mostly been

01:39:57.586 --> 01:39:59.773
"disintegrated or destroyed in the process."

01:39:59.773 --> 01:40:07.333
LIAM: Nearly killed. Does it talk about any of the
people who were nearly killed but weren't?

01:40:07.333 --> 01:40:10.772
MATT: Yes, but they existed close to 1500 years
ago.

01:40:10.772 --> 01:40:12.852
LIAM: No record of their names?

01:40:12.852 --> 01:40:20.062
MATT: The names that were in there are none that
correlate to anything you'd recognize.

01:40:20.062 --> 01:40:23.714
LIAM: I would still have spent the entire three
days reading about that.

01:40:23.714 --> 01:40:28.796
MATT: I'll send you those notes later. You do pick
up, because of your very high roll, there are

01:40:28.796 --> 01:40:34.708
apparently some newer arcane experiments regarding
time and reality being fielded within the Soltryce

01:40:34.708 --> 01:40:43.543
Academy in Rexxentrum. A newer magical energy
seems to have been discovered, or rediscovered,

01:40:43.543 --> 01:40:49.675
that can seemingly adjust such properties with
ease. It's being referred to as "Dunamis."

01:40:49.675 --> 01:40:51.820
LIAM: Dunamis.

01:40:51.858 --> 01:40:55.048
MATT: But other than that, there's very little
information because all that seems to be

01:40:55.048 --> 01:40:56.722
proprietary within the Academy.

01:40:56.722 --> 01:41:06.327
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, good, cool. Super cool. <i>Danke</i>. Then
I'm all done with all my shit.

01:41:06.327 --> 01:41:09.574
TRAVIS: I forgot, I should've looked at my list. I
had one or two other little things.

01:41:09.574 --> 01:41:11.199
MATT: Okay, Fjord, what else would you like to
do?

01:41:11.199 --> 01:41:14.233
SAM: You didn't want to just walk for six days and
walk back for six days?

01:41:14.233 --> 01:41:17.780
TRAVIS: I was like, I feel like I came up-- Oh,
there's more shit.

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.508
MATT: I was like, are you sure that's all you want
to do?

01:41:19.508 --> 01:41:27.524
TRAVIS: Yeah. We can just say on the way back from
those visits, at night when I made camp, I want to

01:41:27.524 --> 01:41:35.394
summon the falchion and spend more time with it.
Examine it, specifically the eye, if it has that

01:41:35.394 --> 01:41:42.244
sort of-- in the letter, it looked like there was
a gash into the sphere itself. Does it represent

01:41:42.244 --> 01:41:45.126
that, is it smooth? Does it move?

01:41:45.126 --> 01:41:52.923
MATT: The eye, where it sits in the hilt-- and it
only sits on one side, it's not both sides that

01:41:52.923 --> 01:41:57.203
contain the eye, because there aren't two pupils.
There is a singular eye that is embedded in it,

01:41:57.203 --> 01:42:00.721
that is looking out what would essentially be
towards the left.

01:42:00.721 --> 01:42:04.202
TRAVIS: Is it near the crossguard, or is it near
the pommel?

01:42:04.202 --> 01:42:12.085
MATT: No, it's near the crossguard, in the center
of the hilt. When you look at it, it doesn't seem

01:42:12.085 --> 01:42:17.819
to move or shift or pay any attention. Practicing
the next few days and trying some things out, you

01:42:17.819 --> 01:42:27.102
focus some of your arcane gifts towards an object,
casting Witch Bolt towards a nearby rock or low,

01:42:27.102 --> 01:42:35.487
dried, and forgotten trunk of a tree. At the
moment the incantation begins, the eye shifts to

01:42:35.487 --> 01:42:41.366
look towards the target of the spell. The spell
explodes and you look back at the hilt, and it's

01:42:41.366 --> 01:42:43.361
already reverted back to where it was before.

01:42:43.361 --> 01:42:44.688
TRAVIS: Super fast.

01:42:44.688 --> 01:42:48.596
MATT: But it did seem to react to when the spell
was cast.

01:42:48.596 --> 01:42:59.555
TRAVIS: Creepy. What the hell does that mean?
Okay. When I get back, could I make my way to The

01:42:59.555 --> 01:43:01.466
Gentleman for just a quick convo?

01:43:01.466 --> 01:43:07.707
MATT: Sure, all right. So you make your way to The
Evening Nip. By the time you've returned, it's

01:43:07.707 --> 01:43:11.311
been the better part of the two-week period of
time, and you guys are also generally worried the

01:43:11.367 --> 01:43:14.107
fact that Fjord just vanished during this time
period.

01:43:14.107 --> 01:43:16.843
LAURA: He left while we were shopping.

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.486
MATT: Big surprise.

01:43:18.486 --> 01:43:21.252
TALIESIN: Travis is shouting.

01:43:21.252 --> 01:43:24.225
TRAVIS: You guys are going to shop, ah!

01:43:24.225 --> 01:43:25.911
MATT: (poof sound)

01:43:25.911 --> 01:43:27.452
TRAVIS: What was it?

01:43:27.452 --> 01:43:30.596
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Spooky exit.

01:43:30.596 --> 01:43:38.496
MATT: You make your way to the subterranean
basement of The Evening Nip. The Gentleman is not

01:43:38.496 --> 01:43:43.484
currently present, but upon asking around, and you
wait for about 20 minutes or so, he does return

01:43:43.484 --> 01:43:49.841
from the storage room to the side where you had
previously been led down and through the

01:43:49.841 --> 01:43:57.101
Underworks. As he comes in, he sees you and sits
on the other side of the table, throwing his leg

01:43:57.101 --> 01:44:04.125
over one side and sitting at a very comfortable
and casual way across from you. "Fjord, I'm being

01:44:04.125 --> 01:44:06.001
"told that you're looking for me."

01:44:06.001 --> 01:44:11.839
TRAVIS: Yes, I appreciate you making some time for
me this evening. Turns out we might be traveling a

01:44:11.839 --> 01:44:17.220
little bit pretty soon. We're going to be making
our way towards the Wayfarer's Cove. Your

01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:24.091
knowledge of areas outside of Zadash seems so
extensive, what with the errands you sent us on. I

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:29.600
was wondering, could you share with me any
knowledge you might have about criminal

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:36.086
underbellies, any competitors you might have in
business that's not of an official nature in

01:44:36.086 --> 01:44:46.345
cities, particularly around Nicodranas, Port
Damali, the Menagerie Coast. Is your reach that far?

01:44:46.385 --> 01:44:54.189
MATT: "I have some reaches in places, yes. That's
quite a scope you're requesting. I would say it's

01:44:54.189 --> 01:45:05.283
"a good bet that most criminal elements you would
encounter there are not at my network, except for

01:45:05.283 --> 01:45:08.332
"a handful. It might be more useful to you to know
the ones to trust."

01:45:08.332 --> 01:45:10.518
TRAVIS: That's where I was going with that.

01:45:10.518 --> 01:45:14.085
MATT: "Okay. Port Damali, you say?"

01:45:14.085 --> 01:45:15.596
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's where I'm from.

01:45:15.596 --> 01:45:16.992
MATT: "Really?"

01:45:16.992 --> 01:45:17.804
TRAVIS: Indeed.

01:45:17.804 --> 01:45:21.749
MATT: "The jewel of the coast. I've been a number
of times, though it's been years since I've been

01:45:21.749 --> 01:45:28.897
"able to leave my work here alone. So if you're
looking to expand your portfolio beyond Zadash,

01:45:28.897 --> 01:45:36.168
"that is commendable. The one contact I could
recommend in Port Damali would be Father Dwandath Pierce."

01:45:36.168 --> 01:45:40.179
TRAVIS: Father Dwandath Pierce?

01:45:40.179 --> 01:45:46.038
MATT: "Dwarven fellow. Scraggly in the face.
Dresses well. He helms the Pearl Shrine, a house

01:45:46.038 --> 01:45:50.968
"of worship to Avandra, the Changebringer. Tell him
that you bring many gifts."

01:45:50.968 --> 01:45:53.605
TRAVIS: I bring many gifts.

01:45:53.605 --> 01:46:00.898
MATT: "Should you not work with Father Pierce and
his network, be careful. You could easily find

01:46:00.898 --> 01:46:05.090
"yourself on an opposing side to my business, and I
do not take kindly to betrayal."

01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:11.505
TRAVIS: Indeed, I wouldn't dare. After all, you do
have a little way of keeping track of where we are

01:46:11.505 --> 01:46:12.875
and what we do.

01:46:12.875 --> 01:46:13.989
MATT: "That I do."

01:46:13.989 --> 01:46:21.512
TRAVIS: I appreciate your help in this matter.
Hopefully we can be of some service to you down there.

01:46:21.512 --> 01:46:25.347
MATT: "If something comes to mind, I'll send it
your way."

01:46:25.347 --> 01:46:26.531
TRAVIS: Please do.

01:46:26.531 --> 01:46:30.958
MATT: "And if anything comes to mind that would be
of interest to my ears, business or otherwise,

01:46:30.958 --> 01:46:33.090
"please keep me informed."

01:46:33.090 --> 01:46:37.518
TRAVIS: You can be assured that I will. Thank you
for your time, I'll leave you now.

01:46:37.518 --> 01:46:43.392
MATT: "Of course." Then he goes off to get a drink
at the bar. As you turn around, right there at the

01:46:43.392 --> 01:46:54.012
steps is Cree, the dark-furred tabaxi. She
approaches and goes, "I'm sorry to bother you, I

01:46:54.012 --> 01:47:06.165
"noticed you descend here. I have heard since your
last arrival that there were losses in your journey."

01:47:06.165 --> 01:47:15.197
TRAVIS: (stuttering) Hm?

01:47:15.197 --> 01:47:31.854
MATT: "I have had a number of uncomfortable dreams
in the week, and... I cannot sense Lucien."

01:47:31.854 --> 01:47:40.221
TRAVIS: Tell me about these dreams.

01:47:40.221 --> 01:47:43.754
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:47:43.754 --> 01:47:53.184
TRAVIS: Oh god. Oh, that's good. 18.

01:47:53.184 --> 01:48:16.625
MATT: "They are cold and sad. I just see him
alone, and I've tried to focus. He is not nearby.

01:48:16.625 --> 01:48:21.404
"I have a very hollow feeling about this."

01:48:21.404 --> 01:48:33.421
TRAVIS: (whispering) God, why was I gone for six
weeks? Okay. (normal volume) Yes, unfortunately

01:48:33.421 --> 01:48:46.060
your dreams may have some merit. I myself was
missing for most of our journey, and it seems,

01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:50.968
unfortunately, that Lucien befell a terrible
fate.

01:48:50.968 --> 01:48:57.448
MATT: "That was what I was fearing."

01:48:57.448 --> 01:49:04.309
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to be the one to let you know.
If I was there I could give you more detail, but I

01:49:04.309 --> 01:49:08.789
found out much in the same way you are.

01:49:08.789 --> 01:49:19.444
MATT: "That is all right. Thank you for your
honesty. It is hard for him to be gone for so

01:49:19.444 --> 01:49:26.979
"long, then come back, and so swiftly go again.
Maybe I had put too much faith."

01:49:26.979 --> 01:49:37.199
TRAVIS: You said he left before and then came
back. If you don't mind my asking, the last time

01:49:37.199 --> 01:49:42.035
that he left, do you remember the circumstances of
his departure?

01:49:42.035 --> 01:49:58.193
MATT: "We of the Task Takers, we were undergoing a
ritual that he had orchestrated with an ally of

01:49:58.193 --> 01:50:09.827
"his, a woman of magical renown. He said that this
was something that was meant to lead us to this

01:50:09.827 --> 01:50:21.725
"city he promised, a place where we could learn of
a great many powers and secrets. We believed him.

01:50:21.725 --> 01:50:31.607
"He was very charismatic in his cruelty at times.
But he did not survive."

01:50:31.607 --> 01:50:39.912
TRAVIS: And then you saw him here for the first
time in quite a while, yes?

01:50:39.912 --> 01:50:43.745
MATT: Two years.

01:50:46.455 --> 01:50:58.546
TRAVIS: Two years? Two years. Are you-- and
forgive me if this is too personal-- are you

01:50:58.546 --> 01:51:01.629
expecting to see him again?

01:51:01.629 --> 01:51:13.676
MATT: I wasn't expecting to see him this last
time. I feel like whatever grace brought him back

01:51:13.676 --> 01:51:23.154
to us, maybe it was your carelessness that took
him from us again.

01:51:23.154 --> 01:51:35.110
TRAVIS: Indeed, maybe it was. You have my
apologies and my condolences.

01:51:35.110 --> 01:51:41.406
MATT: It is all right. I have started a new life
here, and it has been serving me well.

01:51:41.406 --> 01:51:51.270
TRAVIS: I hate to leave you with such sour news,
but I must be going.

01:51:51.270 --> 01:52:00.705
MATT: Such are these days. Thank you for your
candor. She turns around and walks away.

01:52:00.705 --> 01:52:08.416
TRAVIS: Fuck. Then I'll head back to The Leaky
Tap.

01:52:08.416 --> 01:52:13.107
MATT: Okay. You guys have all gathered up at The
Leaky Tap?

01:52:13.107 --> 01:52:16.137
SAM: Everyone's done their stuff.

01:52:16.137 --> 01:52:17.816
TALIESIN: No, I have not done mine.

01:52:17.816 --> 01:52:19.372
MATT: All right, what do you want to do?

01:52:19.372 --> 01:52:23.770
TALIESIN: Mine's very simple. I'm going to spend a
little time every day-- I'm going to find the

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:28.687
nicest park in town. I'm going to spend every day
and I'm going to meditate and try and get some

01:52:28.687 --> 01:52:35.148
guidance. I'm trying to have another epiphany
about what happens next. I'm going to sit quietly

01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:40.658
and meditate every day somewhere green, or
whatever passes for it in this city.

01:52:40.658 --> 01:52:42.592
MATT: Roll a wisdom check for me.

01:52:42.592 --> 01:52:52.758
TALIESIN: No. That was a one.

01:52:52.758 --> 01:52:59.186
MATT: Okay. You've spent so much of your life in
the tranquility of the cold and quiet

01:52:59.186 --> 01:53:05.731
Savalierwood, and even in the most nature-based
portion of the city of Zadash, the general din and

01:53:05.731 --> 01:53:09.915
chaos of the city is too distracting. You're
unable to reach that meditative state where you're

01:53:09.915 --> 01:53:16.174
able to feel connected with nature and with the
Wildmother, so Melora's guidance does not come to

01:53:16.174 --> 01:53:22.689
you. You have to continue to throw your lot in
with these strange folks that dragged you out of

01:53:22.689 --> 01:53:23.635
your home.

01:53:23.635 --> 01:53:26.893
TALIESIN: That's fair. I guess the only-- no,
that's right, we're done. I think we got

01:53:26.893 --> 01:53:27.885
everything.

01:53:27.885 --> 01:53:29.275
SAM: Yeah, everyone's done their thing.

01:53:29.275 --> 01:53:31.222
LAURA: No! I am not done.

01:53:31.222 --> 01:53:32.335
MATT: All right.

01:53:32.335 --> 01:53:40.661
LAURA: Well, because I want to make the Traveler
like me again, because obviously he doesn't and

01:53:40.661 --> 01:53:48.551
that's why he didn't come save me. I'm going to
use these two weeks to scout out all of the

01:53:48.551 --> 01:53:58.017
temples to the other gods and really see the guard
schedules and the priest schedules and try to

01:53:58.017 --> 01:54:02.042
sneak in. I'll probably enlist the help of Nott
here.

01:54:02.042 --> 01:54:03.084
SAM: I'll help you.

01:54:03.084 --> 01:54:04.215
LAURA: Because you're good at sneaking.

01:54:04.215 --> 01:54:05.178
SAM: Sure.

01:54:05.178 --> 01:54:06.804
TALIESIN: Well, we do have something we can--

01:54:06.804 --> 01:54:07.905
LAURA: This is true.

01:54:07.905 --> 01:54:09.370
TALIESIN: We got you something.

01:54:09.370 --> 01:54:12.661
LAURA: Before we do this, this will be extra
helpful for you.

01:54:12.661 --> 01:54:18.105
SAM: What is it? I don't like this. Is it
something-- is it made of dead people?

01:54:18.150 --> 01:54:19.675
LAURA: Just check it out.

01:54:19.675 --> 01:54:21.013
TALIESIN: Made of paper.

01:54:21.013 --> 01:54:24.208
SAM: It's so nicely wrapped. It's so tiny.

01:54:24.208 --> 01:54:27.635
LAURA: Well, imagine it's a lot bigger than that.

01:54:27.635 --> 01:54:37.248
SAM: It's tiny, it's just a small cube. Oh, look.
It says, "To the bravest rouge we've ever met.

01:54:37.248 --> 01:54:40.446
"From your friendly--"

01:54:40.446 --> 01:54:41.692
LAURA: It does say rouge, doesn't it?

01:54:41.692 --> 01:54:50.349
SAM: No, it says rogue, I'm fucking with you. "From
your friendly neighborhood healers." You guys can

01:54:50.389 --> 01:55:01.613
heal? It's a cloak! Wow! It looks so cool and
fancy!

01:55:01.613 --> 01:55:05.736
LAURA: Put it on. I bet it changes size when you
put it on, because most magical things do.

01:55:05.736 --> 01:55:08.486
SAM: I will put it on and spend some time with
it.

01:55:08.486 --> 01:55:12.222
MATT: Okay. You're able to attune to it and gain
the benefits of a Cloak of Elvenkind.

01:55:12.222 --> 01:55:18.743
LAURA: And then we're going to go and try to sneak
in and really fuck up--

01:55:18.743 --> 01:55:21.013
MATT: Well, you'll have to decide which
ones you're going to do.

01:55:21.058 --> 01:55:23.265
LAURA: How much time do we have? What?

01:55:23.265 --> 01:55:24.741
SAM: How much do I owe you for this?

01:55:24.741 --> 01:55:25.869
LAURA: You owe us nothing!

01:55:25.869 --> 01:55:26.890
TRAVIS: It's a gift.

01:55:26.890 --> 01:55:28.024
LAURA: You have nothing!

01:55:28.024 --> 01:55:34.187
SAM: Got tons of money. Way more than I'll ever
spend.

01:55:34.187 --> 01:55:41.104
MATT: There is the Raven's Den, which sits near
the Ossuary Gates--

01:55:41.104 --> 01:55:42.598
LAURA: I already fucked with that one.

01:55:42.598 --> 01:55:51.098
MATT: All righty. There is the Hearth of the
Allhammer, which you've messed with as well a

01:55:51.098 --> 01:56:04.126
little bit during the festival. There's the Valley
Archive of the Cobalt Soul. While it is both an

01:56:04.126 --> 01:56:10.803
archive, it is also a temple to the Knowing
Mistress. There is the King's Hall, which is the

01:56:10.803 --> 01:56:15.740
center of law, and of course that's where the law
master is you've spoken with a couple of times.

01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:20.025
That's where you've done your jobs off the
Taskboard.

01:56:20.025 --> 01:56:21.809
LAURA: Seems like there's a lot of guards there.

01:56:21.809 --> 01:56:26.441
MATT: Yeah, there's a lot of guards there. There's
the Platinum House, which is a temple to the

01:56:26.441 --> 01:56:35.457
Platinum Dragon. That also exists in the
Interstead Sprawl. Not too far from Steam's

01:56:35.457 --> 01:56:37.250
Respite, which is the bathhouse.

01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:41.056
LAURA: Ooh, yeah, let's do that one because it's
close to the bathhouse.

01:56:41.056 --> 01:56:42.474
SAM: Which one is that? Which god?

01:56:42.474 --> 01:56:44.842
LAURA and MATT: The Platinum Dragon.

01:56:44.842 --> 01:56:48.202
SAM: All right, that seems right. What are we
going to do to it?

01:56:48.202 --> 01:56:52.935
MATT: There's also in the Signet Wall, which
is the military district, there is The Shrine of

01:56:53.041 --> 01:56:56.739
the Dawn, which is to the Dawnfather. It's up to
you.

01:56:56.739 --> 01:57:01.566
LAURA: Well, that's just fitting, isn't it? No,
I'm going to do the Platinum Dragon because it's

01:57:01.566 --> 01:57:02.777
next to the bathhouse.

01:57:02.777 --> 01:57:04.030
MATT: Okay, Platinum House it is.

01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:06.100
SAM: We're trying to destroy this place?

01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:07.118
LAURA: No.

01:57:07.118 --> 01:57:07.965
SAM: Paint it?

01:57:07.965 --> 01:57:09.043
LAURA: What does it look like?

01:57:09.043 --> 01:57:13.604
MATT: As you approach, this beautiful but small
white building is draped in deep blue tapestries,

01:57:13.604 --> 01:57:17.593
while a reflective mirrored sphere sits atop the
roof during the day. I think you've passed by and

01:57:17.593 --> 01:57:23.242
seen it before when you were traversing the city.
Are you going at day or nighttime?

01:57:23.242 --> 01:57:26.327
LAURA: We're checking out during the day, you
know, like we're visitors.

01:57:26.327 --> 01:57:32.120
MATT: Okay. The inside is open archways and floor
spaces. They're made available for worship, but

01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:37.625
also used for meditation. There are a few folks in
there that are quietly, eyes closed, taking in the

01:57:37.625 --> 01:57:44.454
atmosphere of the interior. There's areas for
reading and there's areas for napping and

01:57:44.454 --> 01:57:51.640
sleeping. Of the Bahamut worshiping that goes on
in places you've seen on the Menagerie Coast, this

01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:57.203
one is a little more New Age-y than you're used
to. About noonish when you arrive, there is a

01:57:57.203 --> 01:58:04.974
sermon beginning, where there is the Herald of the
House, which is a silver-scaled dragonborn in his

01:58:04.974 --> 01:58:11.510
older years. He looks very tired and as withered
as a dragonborn can through their silver scales.

01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:21.333
He's in the process of giving this very deeply
empowering speech about, "The majesty of Bahamut

01:58:21.333 --> 01:58:29.542
"bestows upon us the knowledge and the grace in
which we can be beacons of truth and justice in a

01:58:29.542 --> 01:58:32.442
"world that wishes to swallow all with chaos."

01:58:32.442 --> 01:58:33.796
LAURA: (snoring)

01:58:33.796 --> 01:58:36.162
(laughter)

01:58:36.162 --> 01:58:44.996
MATT: But yeah, the midday stakeout appears to go
well. What do you wish to do?

01:58:44.996 --> 01:58:46.424
LAURA: How often does he come back?

01:58:46.424 --> 01:58:50.590
MATT: He's there most of the day, and in the
evening he appears to go nap somewhere within the

01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:52.139
Platinum House.

01:58:52.139 --> 01:58:55.729
LAURA: And then he gives his sermon during the
next day and the next day? We scout it out a

01:58:55.729 --> 01:58:58.708
couple days in a row to really get the feel for
the guards.

01:58:58.708 --> 01:59:00.519
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

01:59:00.519 --> 01:59:02.381
LAURA: With advantage because Nott's helping me?

01:59:02.381 --> 01:59:04.090
MATT: Sure, sure.

01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:14.193
LAURA: Oh Jesus H. Macy. Nine. Nein!

01:59:14.193 --> 01:59:16.676
MATT: There's a couple entrances, some hallways.

01:59:16.676 --> 01:59:18.048
LAURA: Wow.

01:59:18.048 --> 01:59:20.993
SAM: What do you want to do?

01:59:20.993 --> 01:59:28.912
LAURA: I'm going to take some of the firecrackers
we got from Hupperdook, and I want to set them off

01:59:28.912 --> 01:59:35.751
during his sermon. And then I want to-- but I'm
going to Invoke Duplicity, so it looks like I'm

01:59:35.751 --> 01:59:42.344
actually still there listening to the sermon. Then
while that's happening-- but I'm also Disguise

01:59:42.344 --> 01:59:47.051
Self, so I also want to look like somebody else
while it's happening so nobody can trace it back

01:59:47.051 --> 01:59:48.012
to me.

01:59:48.012 --> 01:59:49.503
SAM: That sounds complicated.

01:59:49.503 --> 01:59:53.516
LAURA: This is really good stuff. And then I want
to run over to-- is there a big statue of the

01:59:53.516 --> 01:59:54.632
Platinum Dragon?

01:59:54.632 --> 02:00:00.303
MATT: There is in the center, yeah. It's not built
on the floor. It's actually held aloft in the

02:00:00.303 --> 02:00:06.112
central domed archway right beneath where that
glowing dome at the top is. At nighttime, as

02:00:06.112 --> 02:00:11.798
you've seen it, it emits this faint, white glow
and is this beacon in the middle of the darkened

02:00:11.798 --> 02:00:19.333
city, aside from the various bits of torchlight
that hit the streets. Beneath this dome, you see

02:00:19.333 --> 02:00:27.204
the large, carved-- looks like a pure platinum,
but it's probably a polished silver-- statue of

02:00:27.204 --> 02:00:32.450
the dragon, wings outstretched, looking down over
the chambers and hovers about 15 feet off the

02:00:32.450 --> 02:00:37.311
ground, where all the rest of the folks gather for
this sermon and/or sit there to meditate and pray

02:00:37.311 --> 02:00:38.644
and worship.

02:00:38.644 --> 02:00:44.360
LAURA: This is a really bad time to do this
because there's lots of people around. Can I do

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:48.354
it at night? Is there less people at night? Would
I have learned at least that much?

02:00:48.354 --> 02:00:50.037
MATT: Yeah, at night, there are less people.

02:00:50.037 --> 02:00:54.052
LAURA: Okay, I come back a second time after
setting up the fireworks. Now the next time--

02:00:54.052 --> 02:00:56.391
SAM: We're here again?

02:00:56.391 --> 02:01:04.654
LAURA: We have to do it right. This time I'm
coming prepared with my paints and a mustache.

02:01:04.654 --> 02:01:06.327
TRAVIS: Your Anarchist's Cookbook.

02:01:06.327 --> 02:01:15.792
LAURA: My Anarchist's Cookbook, a couple brochures
for the Traveler, and I steal Cad's straw hat that

02:01:15.792 --> 02:01:24.083
he bought-- sorry-- and, yeah, we're going to make
the Platinum Dragon look like a really cool

02:01:24.083 --> 02:01:25.556
farmer.

02:01:25.556 --> 02:01:30.401
SAM: All right. Okay. So we're going to mess with
the statue.

02:01:30.401 --> 02:01:32.885
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I do. Is it stupid or
something?

02:01:32.885 --> 02:01:35.199
SAM: What if someone comes in? We kill everyone in
the place?

02:01:35.199 --> 02:01:39.456
LAURA: No, if somebody comes in, you need to
distract them, okay? Don't let anybody see me,

02:01:39.456 --> 02:01:40.784
because this might take a while.

02:01:40.784 --> 02:01:43.993
SAM: So I'm the distraction and the lookout.

02:01:43.993 --> 02:01:48.084
LAURA: You're the distraction. I also Invoke
Duplicity to where it looks like I'm still there

02:01:48.084 --> 02:01:52.596
on the outside and I can also be hanging out with
you so you don't look like a random person.

02:01:52.596 --> 02:01:54.869
MATT: What do you disguise yourself to be?

02:01:54.869 --> 02:01:57.333
LAURA: The old woman that was in the other, yeah.

02:01:57.333 --> 02:02:03.442
MATT: You guys approach in the evening, together?
Are you disguising yourself as well?

02:02:03.442 --> 02:02:09.007
LAURA: Ooh, no. You know what I should disguise
myself as? The sermon guy. Yeah.

02:02:09.007 --> 02:02:21.507
MATT: Okay. Jester, now taking the elderly form of
a silver-scaled, very well-respected, Herald of

02:02:21.507 --> 02:02:31.908
the House Kumas. You approach the temple a few
hours after sundown, to where the interest in

02:02:31.908 --> 02:02:36.853
worship tends to fade as folks go back to home.
It's mostly just a few caretakers that watch it

02:02:36.853 --> 02:02:40.482
through the night and some lost souls that have
found their way there in the evening and they need

02:02:40.482 --> 02:02:42.014
guidance.

02:02:42.014 --> 02:02:43.577
LAURA: Get them out.

02:02:43.577 --> 02:02:44.904
SAM: They're in there?

02:02:44.904 --> 02:02:47.140
LAURA: Yeah, distract them and make them go away.

02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:49.310
SAM: All right, I'll do my best.

02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:54.103
LAURA: You know what you should say, say that the
sermon guy, whoever I am, tell them I need some

02:02:54.103 --> 02:02:55.374
quiet time in the temple.

02:02:55.374 --> 02:03:11.512
SAM: All right. I'll disguise myself using
Disguise Self as an elderly gnomish woman, and

02:03:11.512 --> 02:03:25.977
I'll wander into the temple, I guess. Ahem, pardon
me. All patrons, I have a request from the Holy

02:03:25.977 --> 02:03:40.411
Father himself that we vacate the premises. They
have to refresh all the holy water-- that's good--

02:03:40.411 --> 02:03:54.947
every 30 days, and wouldn't you know it? Today's
that day! So out of the pool for a few minutes,

02:03:54.947 --> 02:04:03.647
and then when it's all refreshed, we'll come and
you can come right back in. Just a break! Go and

02:04:03.647 --> 02:04:05.443
take a break.

02:04:05.443 --> 02:04:12.517
MATT: Make a deception check with disadvantage,
because you didn't even use his name. That I've

02:04:12.517 --> 02:04:13.858
said twice.

02:04:13.858 --> 02:04:16.119
MARISHA: Our lord and savior.

02:04:16.119 --> 02:04:18.011
LAURA: Natural 20, natural 20.

02:04:18.011 --> 02:04:24.097
SAM: Okay, not bad. Even better. This is what?

02:04:24.097 --> 02:04:25.795
MATT: Deception.

02:04:25.795 --> 02:04:28.199
SAM: Oh no. That's a negative three.

02:04:28.199 --> 02:04:31.250
TRAVIS: A negative three to your deception?

02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:33.399
LAURA: Oh, you really should've taken that potion
beforehand.

02:04:33.399 --> 02:04:34.840
SAM: The one that you stole from me?

02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:35.893
LAURA: Yeah, that one.

02:04:35.893 --> 02:04:42.211
SAM: That's a 13. Disadvantage, minus three. I
still got pretty good.

02:04:42.211 --> 02:04:50.100
MATT: Okay. Of the six individuals that are here,
there are two that actually are of the temple.

02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:57.794
There are four that are here, meditation. One
looks like a young man, looking like he might be

02:04:57.794 --> 02:05:03.036
on hard times and has tear marks on his face where
he may have been looking up to the statue and

02:05:03.036 --> 02:05:11.968
revelling. The four people that were attending see
you and, "Oh," and they get up and start gathering

02:05:11.968 --> 02:05:17.928
their things. The two that work at the temple are
confused, look at each other, and look at you, and

02:05:17.928 --> 02:05:19.158
begin to walk towards you.

02:05:19.158 --> 02:05:27.880
SAM: Are they carrying weapons of any sort, or
vestments or jewels?

02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:38.371
MATT: No, they're wearing tabards that are mostly
a silver-white color with the symbol of Bahamut,

02:05:38.371 --> 02:05:48.093
the blue with the silver dragon. They're simply
dressed. They're the caretakers of the temple,

02:05:48.093 --> 02:05:57.263
low-level priests of the Platinum Dragon. As they
approach, one of them looks to be a mid-30s human

02:05:57.263 --> 02:06:05.281
male, male-pattern baldness taking a large portion
of his shorter, blond hair. The other one appears

02:06:05.281 --> 02:06:13.278
to be a half-elven man as well. He looks younger,
but looks can be deceiving with half-elves. They

02:06:13.278 --> 02:06:18.828
both approach with a somewhat concerned look and
the half-elf speaks up first and goes, "I'm sorry,

02:06:18.828 --> 02:06:23.854
"you said that the Holy Father needs the room
cleared?"

02:06:23.854 --> 02:06:25.487
LAURA: I come up from behind.

02:06:25.487 --> 02:06:34.961
SAM: Is there anything around us, like donation
jars, or anything around us? I don't know how

02:06:34.961 --> 02:06:37.100
churches work, guys.

02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:40.263
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:06:40.263 --> 02:06:46.311
SAM: Do they have a ticket-taker? 14.

02:06:46.311 --> 02:06:54.782
MATT: Looking around, there are bowls throughout
the room. Most of them appear to be empty, a few

02:06:54.782 --> 02:07:01.007
of them have a few knick-knacks thrown in there.
They may have been things that people left as a

02:07:01.007 --> 02:07:06.370
gift or an offering. A few copper, one of them
could even have a silver. You don't see any other

02:07:06.370 --> 02:07:09.543
boxes. It looks like they're cleared out fairly
frequently.

02:07:09.543 --> 02:07:20.039
SAM: If there's one close to me, I would like to
cast Mage Hand and grab it.

02:07:20.039 --> 02:07:24.902
MATT: Okay. Triple-checking if Mage Hand has--

02:07:24.902 --> 02:07:27.295
SAM: I'm sure I will drop my form.

02:07:27.295 --> 02:07:36.806
MATT: Well, Disguise Self remains cast. However,
Mage Hand, if I recall, may have--

02:07:36.806 --> 02:07:41.785
SAM: It's an action to make it appear.

02:07:41.785 --> 02:07:45.903
MATT: Correct, but it's verbal and somatic, so as
they're approaching, you look back and forth and

02:07:45.903 --> 02:07:53.065
begin casting a spell. As this is happening, they
both go, "Uh--"

02:07:53.065 --> 02:08:05.770
LAURA: No! I step up from behind Nott. Thank you,
dear. My assistant did as I asked. I really needed

02:08:05.770 --> 02:08:09.109
some quiet time alone in the temple tonight.

02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:13.293
MATT: "I wasn't aware you had an assistant?"

02:08:13.293 --> 02:08:15.302
LAURA: I just hired her.

02:08:15.302 --> 02:08:17.575
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:08:17.575 --> 02:08:22.615
SAM: Oh god.

02:08:22.615 --> 02:08:24.964
LAURA: 16?

02:08:24.964 --> 02:08:38.767
MATT: One of them goes, "Oh, of course, my
apologies, Your Grace," and the human leaves. The

02:08:38.767 --> 02:08:51.447
half-elf still seems dubious. "Your Grace, you
seem to be rather weary. Perhaps I should stay and

02:08:51.447 --> 02:08:53.138
"make sure you need help."

02:08:53.138 --> 02:08:55.899
LAURA: I need some quiet time.

02:08:55.899 --> 02:08:58.575
MATT: "I'll be quiet."

02:08:58.575 --> 02:09:04.388
LAURA: No, no. (coughs) No.

02:09:04.388 --> 02:09:15.418
SAM: I think what His Holiness is trying to convey
is that he will be going on a spiritual journey,

02:09:15.418 --> 02:09:20.252
and there's only room on that train for one dude!

02:09:20.252 --> 02:09:26.755
LAURA: Scoot on out. Scoot it.

02:09:26.755 --> 02:09:38.851
MATT: "Of course, Your Grace." The half-elf
leaves, but his eyes don't deviate. He appears to

02:09:38.851 --> 02:09:40.408
leave the room.

02:09:40.408 --> 02:09:43.385
SAM: That was perfect.

02:09:43.385 --> 02:09:48.803
LAURA: That went really well! Right? Okay. You
stand right here.

02:09:48.803 --> 02:09:51.294
SAM: I'm going to watch the door. They all went
out the front door?

02:09:51.294 --> 02:09:56.034
MATT: There's open archways that lead down long
hallways, and they all appear to have left the

02:09:56.034 --> 02:09:56.956
hallways.

02:09:56.956 --> 02:10:02.132
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity. I'm
going to make it look like he's kneeling down in

02:10:02.132 --> 02:10:08.150
the doorway, praying. Then I'm going to run up,
and I want to start painting up the Platinum

02:10:08.150 --> 02:10:09.380
Dragon.

02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:13.643
MATT: Okay, so your Invoke Duplicity's there, and
you-- the Platinum Dragon's about 15 feet up.

02:10:13.643 --> 02:10:16.130
LAURA: Yeah, I climb on up! I start painting.

02:10:16.130 --> 02:10:17.756
MATT: Make an athletics check.

02:10:17.756 --> 02:10:20.257
TALIESIN: We're going to be busting you out of
jail.

02:10:20.257 --> 02:10:23.164
TRAVIS and LIAM: Yep.

02:10:23.164 --> 02:10:24.367
LAURA: That's a 22.

02:10:24.367 --> 02:10:33.148
MATT: Using very minute ledges that are carved out
of the various temple pillars that hold up and

02:10:33.148 --> 02:10:41.012
maintain the weight of the beautiful archways that
mark the top part of the temple, you tiny rock

02:10:41.012 --> 02:10:46.205
climb with the finger strength that only Jester
has in this whole group setup, and make your way

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:54.577
up carefully-- one, two-- leap and then grab onto
the Platinum Dragon. It hangs back and forth a

02:10:54.577 --> 02:10:58.798
bit, and you can now see-- what you can't see from
far down is there are two sets of chains that hold

02:10:58.798 --> 02:11:02.890
it aloft up in the temple. It is free hanging and
now you're rocking back and forth.

02:11:02.890 --> 02:11:06.745
LAURA: Ooh, you know what? I could just knock this
down. That could be really good, too.

02:11:06.745 --> 02:11:09.581
SAM: That would be faster. I'm going to hide in
one of the pews.

02:11:09.581 --> 02:11:11.778
MATT: Make a stealth check.

02:11:11.778 --> 02:11:16.884
LAURA: I start climbing up and I want to paint it
rainbow colors. I feel like that would be a really

02:11:16.884 --> 02:11:19.211
nice addition for the Platinum Dragon.

02:11:19.211 --> 02:11:26.272
MATT: Okay. You begin painting rainbow colors and
pulling out all your various pigments and the

02:11:26.272 --> 02:11:32.033
platinum begins to give way to a Technicolor vomit
nightmare.

02:11:32.033 --> 02:11:35.748
LAURA: With a mustache. And a straw hat.

02:11:35.748 --> 02:11:40.659
MATT: As you're getting to the mustache, you hear
many, many footfalls approaching and a voice

02:11:40.659 --> 02:11:44.046
saying, "Yeah, just this way, I--"

02:11:44.046 --> 02:11:46.185
LAURA: I drop down and run.

02:11:46.185 --> 02:11:53.011
MATT: Okay. As he's in the middle of talking,
(thud). Make an acrobatics check, because it's a

02:11:53.011 --> 02:11:55.822
15-foot drop.

02:11:55.822 --> 02:11:57.886
LAURA: 21.

02:11:57.886 --> 02:12:03.568
MATT: Wow, okay. A three-point landing in the
middle. You're still--

02:12:03.568 --> 02:12:05.349
LAURA: I'm still the dragon.

02:12:05.349 --> 02:12:09.706
MATT: But there's also the Invoke Duplicity of him
there, so there's one, he goes, "That's the--"

02:12:09.706 --> 02:12:11.172
(thud), "What? Huh?"

02:12:11.172 --> 02:12:12.469
LAURA: (shrieks) And I run.

02:12:12.469 --> 02:12:20.671
MATT: They give chase. They go, "After whoever
that is!" There are now five crownsguard and two

02:12:20.671 --> 02:12:25.377
members of the House giving chase down one of the
hallways.

02:12:25.377 --> 02:12:29.963
LAURA: Was there an exit? Looking for an exit.

02:12:29.963 --> 02:12:32.610
MATT: Make a perception check to look around you, as
this is happening rather rapidly.

02:12:32.610 --> 02:12:37.442
SAM: Oh god. I'm going to follow from behind
stealthily.

02:12:37.442 --> 02:12:39.218
LAURA: 23.

02:12:39.218 --> 02:12:43.692
MATT: As you're rushing down, you look and there's
two open doorways. One of them appears to be a

02:12:43.692 --> 02:12:48.108
dark interior, the other appears to lead to some
sort of candlelight. The hall's coming to an end

02:12:48.108 --> 02:12:51.571
ahead of you. Right or left, which way are you
going?

02:12:51.571 --> 02:12:53.070
LAURA: Wait. Say that again.

02:12:53.070 --> 02:12:57.801
MATT: There's two open doorways. One is dark on
the inside, the other seems to have candlelight

02:12:57.801 --> 02:12:59.421
from the interior.

02:12:59.421 --> 02:13:00.510
LAURA: Dark.

02:13:00.510 --> 02:13:01.881
MATT: All right, you duck into the dark room.

02:13:01.881 --> 02:13:03.307
LAURA: This is like a Choose Your Own Adventure.

02:13:03.307 --> 02:13:08.186
MATT: Yeah. The footfalls are coming faster and
faster behind you, and Nott, you're noticing that

02:13:08.186 --> 02:13:14.872
they're drawing weapons and one of them appears to
be pulling out some sort of a bead out of their

02:13:14.872 --> 02:13:16.588
pocket. That's all you notice.

02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:28.582
SAM: Okay. I'm going to scream as loud as I can
from behind them, and scream: Oh my god, he's dead!

02:13:28.582 --> 02:13:35.729
MATT: Well, they all immediately stop and look
behind at you.

02:13:35.729 --> 02:13:37.393
LAURA: How many are there?

02:13:37.393 --> 02:13:40.684
MATT: There's five crownsguard and then two
members of the church.

02:13:40.684 --> 02:13:42.255
LAURA: Okay, I'm hiding in the room.

02:13:42.255 --> 02:13:45.237
MATT: Make a stealth check, please.

02:13:45.237 --> 02:13:48.275
MARISHA: At least four stars on Grand Theft Auto.

02:13:48.275 --> 02:13:50.309
LAURA: 19.

02:13:50.309 --> 02:13:58.755
MATT: You think you may be hidden. They turn and
look at you. "What?"

02:13:58.755 --> 02:14:03.382
SAM: He stopped breathing! He's back there, didn't
you see him?

02:14:03.382 --> 02:14:05.301
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:14:05.301 --> 02:14:07.781
SAM: Oh god. That's a nine.

02:14:07.781 --> 02:14:09.248
LAURA: Oh no!

02:14:09.248 --> 02:14:19.346
MATT: As they're all looking, the one that had the
bead goes-- throws it your direction.

02:14:19.346 --> 02:14:21.903
LAURA: Oh no, dodge it!

02:14:21.903 --> 02:14:23.231
SAM: I'll try.

02:14:23.231 --> 02:14:26.035
MATT: That's an 18 to hit.

02:14:26.035 --> 02:14:27.098
SAM: That hits.

02:14:27.098 --> 02:14:33.735
MATT: Okay. Let me look this up again. I wasn't
expecting it to go this way.

02:14:33.735 --> 02:14:35.074
SAM: There's no save, right?

02:14:35.074 --> 02:14:50.465
MATT: I'm going to double-check. You make a
dexterity saving throw.

02:14:50.465 --> 02:14:59.165
SAM: Whew. Thank goodness. I'm wearing my cloak,
so I get advantage. That's a natural 20.

02:14:59.165 --> 02:15:09.925
MATT: Okay, so you don't take any force damage.
However, this sphere of translucent force has

02:15:09.925 --> 02:15:11.875
completely encapsulated you.

02:15:11.875 --> 02:15:13.039
SAM: Jester?

02:15:13.039 --> 02:15:15.654
MATT: And you're just slowly rolling back, like
(rumbling).

02:15:15.654 --> 02:15:18.122
SAM: Ah, Jester!

02:15:18.122 --> 02:15:22.435
MATT: Two of the guards come over to flank it, the
other three continue their travel with the two

02:15:22.435 --> 02:15:27.374
members of the church, so there's five. They then
duck into the dark room where you are, as one of

02:15:27.374 --> 02:15:32.110
them lights a torch to light up the chamber. Now
you quickly made your way through, this is a

02:15:32.110 --> 02:15:35.978
storage chamber, and on the inside you can see
there's a bunch of candles, there's a bunch of

02:15:35.978 --> 02:15:46.332
statues and things that are used in various
ceremonies. There's a number of wooden hanging

02:15:46.332 --> 02:15:52.091
rods, that they place a lot of vestments on that
are not used. They're for more formal events

02:15:52.091 --> 02:15:59.533
and celebrations and holidays. You have put your
way into a corner between one of these boxes and

02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:02.499
some of the raiments in the hope that you won't be
seen. They are going to make a very thorough

02:16:02.542 --> 02:16:03.601
investigation of the room.

02:16:03.601 --> 02:16:05.538
LAURA: Okay, and when they come in the room--

02:16:05.538 --> 02:16:14.642
MATT: They begin to slowly look through. One of
the members of the church, after the first 30

02:16:14.642 --> 02:16:18.468
seconds of not finding anyone, darts off. So
there's only four in the chamber, he's going to

02:16:18.468 --> 02:16:24.108
look elsewhere. The crownsguard begin to peek
through, lifting up pieces of equipment, lifting

02:16:24.108 --> 02:16:26.299
up the tops of storage containers.

02:16:26.299 --> 02:16:27.391
LAURA: How big is the room?

02:16:27.391 --> 02:16:30.177
MATT: The room's about 15 by ten feet, it's not a
very large room.

02:16:30.177 --> 02:16:31.640
LAURA: Oh bejeebies.

02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:39.811
SAM: By the way, I only have advantage on
<i>stealth</i>, not on saving throws.

02:16:39.811 --> 02:16:41.056
MATT: Okay, so roll again.

02:16:41.056 --> 02:16:44.132
SAM: So the first roll that I had rolled was a
five, which adds up to a 12.

02:16:44.132 --> 02:16:45.301
MATT: Oh!

02:16:45.301 --> 02:16:46.489
SAM: So I will take damage.

02:16:46.489 --> 02:16:48.106
MATT: You do. You take 5d4 points of force
damage.

02:16:48.106 --> 02:16:49.762
LAURA: 5d4?

02:16:49.762 --> 02:16:55.244
MATT: Five, seven, eight. You take 11 points of
force damage.

02:16:55.244 --> 02:16:59.301
SAM: Oh. Thank you. Thank you, sir! May I have
another?

02:16:59.301 --> 02:17:11.682
MATT: So this is equivalent essentially to an
Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. You're in a hamster

02:17:11.682 --> 02:17:15.381
ball, but the two guards that are right there are
flanking it and holding it in place so you can't move.

02:17:15.381 --> 02:17:18.169
LAURA: I cast Blink on myself.

02:17:18.169 --> 02:17:24.301
MATT: Okay. As one of them turns, and just manages
to pull the raiments aside, revealing your face.

02:17:24.301 --> 02:17:34.629
"Uh, I found them!" (whoosh) "Wait. No, she was
right-- He was right, I-- Spread out!" And they

02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:37.195
all begin to scatter out into the hallways now.

02:17:37.195 --> 02:17:38.828
LAURA: Okay.

02:17:38.828 --> 02:17:40.268
MATT: You move--

02:17:40.268 --> 02:17:46.420
LAURA: Stealthily. If I-- yeah, because I can move
like, what, ten feet with Blink? Or can I--

02:17:46.458 --> 02:17:49.650
TRAVIS: You can reappear ten feet away. It's
either ten or five.

02:17:49.650 --> 02:17:52.644
LAURA: I've never used Blink before!

02:17:52.644 --> 02:17:54.433
TRAVIS: But you have to roll for it.

02:17:54.433 --> 02:18:00.869
MATT: Correct. So with Blink, at the start of your
next turn, you return within ten feet of where you

02:18:00.869 --> 02:18:02.029
vanished.

02:18:02.029 --> 02:18:07.600
TRAVIS: But you've got to roll 11 or higher for
you to even blink out in the first place.

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:09.380
MATT: So go ahead and roll.

02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:11.481
LAURA: Oh, jeebies.

02:18:11.481 --> 02:18:14.822
TRAVIS: You got it. 11 or higher. No problem.

02:18:14.822 --> 02:18:16.773
TALIESIN: It's fine.

02:18:16.773 --> 02:18:17.783
LAURA: Eight.

02:18:17.783 --> 02:18:19.005
MARISHA: Oh no!

02:18:19.005 --> 02:18:20.741
LAURA: Goddamnit. Why did you have to say
anything?

02:18:20.741 --> 02:18:22.678
MATT: No, thank you. Keep her honest on that one.

02:18:22.678 --> 02:18:25.213
LIAM: Is the Traveler happy with you yet?

02:18:25.213 --> 02:18:34.646
MATT: So your form flickers for a moments as the
spell kicks in. However: you vanish, "Spread out!"

02:18:34.646 --> 02:18:36.864
You're right back in place. "Wait!" and they go
ahead--

02:18:36.864 --> 02:18:38.167
LAURA: Charm Person!

02:18:38.167 --> 02:18:40.409
MATT: You cast Charm Person? All right, it--

02:18:40.409 --> 02:18:42.257
LAURA: At 3rd-level. How many have I used?

02:18:42.257 --> 02:18:45.030
SAM: Jesus. You're using every spell you have.

02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:46.039
LAURA: Yes, I am.

02:18:46.039 --> 02:18:49.293
TALIESIN: This is going to be an expensive problem
to solve here.

02:18:49.293 --> 02:18:52.108
MATT: Okay, so you can target three creatures at
3rd-level.

02:18:52.108 --> 02:18:53.408
LAURA: How many are in the room?

02:18:53.408 --> 02:18:55.319
MATT: There are--

02:18:55.319 --> 02:18:56.588
LAURA: Three in the room now, right?

02:18:56.588 --> 02:18:57.674
MATT: Four in the room total.

02:18:57.674 --> 02:18:58.477
TRAVIS: Are there?

02:18:58.477 --> 02:19:01.348
MATT: Oh, no. Because there are two guards against
him, so there's three after her. Yes, that's

02:19:01.348 --> 02:19:02.213
crownsguard.

02:19:02.213 --> 02:19:03.398
TALIESIN: And then you lost one of them.

02:19:03.398 --> 02:19:04.631
MATT: And then one left so there are four in
there.

02:19:04.631 --> 02:19:05.590
LAURA: There are four in there?

02:19:05.590 --> 02:19:08.649
MATT: There's three crownsguard and one member of
the house. Who do you attack?

02:19:08.649 --> 02:19:09.890
TRAVIS: You can kill him.

02:19:09.890 --> 02:19:11.343
LAURA: Yeah, the crownsguard.

02:19:11.343 --> 02:19:15.144
MATT: All right, so they have advantage on this
save, because you are technically in opposition on

02:19:15.144 --> 02:19:16.470
this one.

02:19:16.470 --> 02:19:17.340
LAURA: Okay.

02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:21.712
MATT: So the first crownsguard, with advantage.
That's going to be a 14. What's the DC?

02:19:21.712 --> 02:19:22.662
LAURA: 15.

02:19:22.662 --> 02:19:31.223
MATT: 15, he fails. Other one, two sixes in a row:
fail! The third one, two and-- No, they all fail!

02:19:31.223 --> 02:19:33.684
Even with advantage.

02:19:33.684 --> 02:19:34.859
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out.

02:19:34.859 --> 02:19:36.539
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:19:36.539 --> 02:19:41.838
MATT: So the three crownsguard come in and are
like, "Have you seen where this person went?

02:19:41.838 --> 02:19:44.091
"Apparently someone's masquerading as you."

02:19:44.091 --> 02:19:49.691
LAURA: Been looking everywhere for him. Can't find
him anywhere. Maybe check that room with the

02:19:49.691 --> 02:19:51.575
candles on the other side of the hallway.

02:19:51.575 --> 02:19:52.713
MATT: "We'll go check."

02:19:52.713 --> 02:19:55.747
SAM and MARISHA: That room with the candles!

02:19:55.747 --> 02:20:00.759
MATT: The three crownsguard turn around and rush
off to find it, while the member of the house, the

02:20:00.759 --> 02:20:08.132
half-elf from earlier, is like, "Nobody? That's--
That's him! Ugh." and is going to rush to try and

02:20:08.132 --> 02:20:10.153
grab you. Go ahead and roll another d20.

02:20:10.153 --> 02:20:11.749
SAM: Just use your handaxe! Oh, wait.

02:20:11.749 --> 02:20:15.821
LAURA: Oh no. Five.

02:20:15.821 --> 02:20:19.836
MATT: Five. No, it's going to go for a full
grapple. It's an athletics check.

02:20:19.836 --> 02:20:24.871
LAURA: Can I-- That's 2nd-level, I can cast it. I
cast Hold Person. On them.

02:20:24.871 --> 02:20:33.820
MATT: Okay. That is going to be a 16. I believe
that's a success. Yeah, 13 plus three.

02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:38.346
LAURA: Grr. (grumbling) You're weak, I'm strong.

02:20:38.346 --> 02:20:40.804
MATT: However, it does come in and go to grapple
you and hold you in place. So you're currently now

02:20:40.804 --> 02:20:44.831
being held in this form by the entity. You can try
and break free by doing an athletics check.

02:20:44.831 --> 02:20:45.903
LAURA: I try to break free.

02:20:45.903 --> 02:20:47.104
MATT: Okay, try it.

02:20:47.104 --> 02:20:48.652
LAURA: Oh, god!

02:20:48.652 --> 02:20:53.209
LIAM: Just everybody think back to the stink eye
Laura gave us on the hospital run.

02:20:53.209 --> 02:20:57.060
LAURA: Yeah, I know. What do I add to this? What do
I add?

02:20:57.060 --> 02:20:58.471
MATT: Your athletics check.

02:20:58.517 --> 02:20:59.438
LAURA: My athletics.

02:20:59.438 --> 02:21:02.307
SAM: I'm going to die trying to help her graffiti
a statue in a church.

02:21:02.307 --> 02:21:04.155
LAURA: Sure, it's a 12.

02:21:04.155 --> 02:21:05.834
MATT: 12, you are grappled.

02:21:05.834 --> 02:21:06.900
LAURA: Goddang it!

02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:08.930
MATT: However go ahead and roll another d20
because your Blink spell is still active.

02:21:08.930 --> 02:21:10.977
LAURA: Oh! 20!

02:21:10.977 --> 02:21:17.502
MATT: You vanish out of their grasp. "What the?!
How?" Begins to just-- Pushing things over and

02:21:17.502 --> 02:21:22.139
looking around for wherever you may have gone.
Next round, you appear ten feet from where you

02:21:22.139 --> 02:21:23.282
were. Where do you want to appear?

02:21:23.282 --> 02:21:24.325
LAURA: Out the doorway.

02:21:24.325 --> 02:21:27.015
MATT: You appear in the doorway. The three guard
are in the other chamber, and they are currently--

02:21:27.015 --> 02:21:33.197
You can now see into the other room where you
didn't run and it looks to be the bedchambers of

02:21:33.197 --> 02:21:36.058
the actual Kumas.

02:21:36.058 --> 02:21:37.184
LAURA: Oh, no.

02:21:37.184 --> 02:21:42.610
MATT: You can hear him like, "What's going on? I
was trying to sleep." They're like, "Ah, sir,

02:21:42.610 --> 02:21:44.122
"there's a-- Wait."

02:21:44.122 --> 02:21:45.518
LAURA: I take off running.

02:21:45.518 --> 02:21:48.036
MATT: As you go running down the hallway, at this
point--

02:21:48.036 --> 02:21:49.224
LAURA: Oh, would I Blink again?

02:21:49.224 --> 02:21:55.434
MATT: The two other crownsguard, who are currently
guarding Nott-- you see now Nott is encapsulated

02:21:55.434 --> 02:22:03.480
in this bubble and is like, "Ah!" and one of them
is pulling out chains and cuffs on them, and

02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:07.755
they're preparing to essentially arrest Nott once
this bubble goes away. They both turn around in

02:22:07.755 --> 02:22:09.519
the middle of this scuffle, and see you running
towards them.

02:22:09.519 --> 02:22:11.205
LAURA: Charm Person, 2nd-level!

02:22:11.251 --> 02:22:14.003
LIAM: Jeez Louise!

02:22:14.003 --> 02:22:19.305
MATT: With advantage, one of them succeeds: two
17's in a row. The other--

02:22:19.305 --> 02:22:21.223
LAURA: I know. When I Blink though--

02:22:21.223 --> 02:22:27.548
MATT: The other one fails, a seven and a one. So
one of them just looks at you and smiles. The one

02:22:27.548 --> 02:22:30.273
holding the chains for Nott. The other one pulls a
blade.

02:22:30.273 --> 02:22:37.229
LAURA: I walk in. Slow down and walk up like: I
heard somebody was impersonating me in here. Have

02:22:37.229 --> 02:22:38.407
you found them yet?

02:22:38.407 --> 02:22:40.423
MATT: Make a deception check with disadvantage.

02:22:40.423 --> 02:22:44.070
LIAM: I'm old!

02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:53.406
LAURA: A 16. This was supposed to go much quicker.
I'm sorry, guys.

02:22:53.406 --> 02:23:00.925
MATT: The blade is pulled out and goes, "We're
sorry, sir. We were called in here. There was

02:23:00.925 --> 02:23:05.800
"apparently a disturbance and we found this one. We
are preparing arrest."

02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:11.075
LAURA: I saw your other guard friends running
that direction. I think the impersonator was back there.

02:23:11.075 --> 02:23:14.048
MATT: "Well, good. Hopefully they'll go ahead and
catch them. We have to wait for this one."

02:23:14.048 --> 02:23:20.096
LAURA: I heard them shouting for help, though. They
were really shouting. Shouting for a lot of help.

02:23:20.096 --> 02:23:25.494
MATT: The one you charmed goes, "Well, I'll go
ahead and find out," and then walks over to help

02:23:25.494 --> 02:23:29.544
them while the one who resisted the charm just
sits there and takes the chains from him and is

02:23:29.544 --> 02:23:33.087
now waiting for Nott to get out. By the way, roll
a d20.

02:23:33.087 --> 02:23:35.114
LAURA: Oh. Shit.

02:23:35.114 --> 02:23:36.311
TRAVIS: Oh, here we go.

02:23:36.311 --> 02:23:37.483
LAURA: Ten. No, I'm still there.

02:23:37.483 --> 02:23:41.556
TRAVIS: (poof, poof) Don't mind that.

02:23:41.556 --> 02:23:43.926
LAURA: Last chance. All alone.

02:23:43.926 --> 02:23:50.288
MATT: The other person from the house comes by,
the half-elf, and says "You fool! That's the one

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:57.843
"that's been--" Now the actual Herald of the House
comes out. He's got his pajamas on, and he's like,

02:23:57.843 --> 02:23:59.787
"What's going-- What's this?"

02:23:59.787 --> 02:24:05.133
LAURA: Ah! How do I get out of this? Can I cast
Dispel Magic on Nott's bubble?

02:24:05.133 --> 02:24:08.155
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20.

02:24:08.155 --> 02:24:10.653
SAM: God, you've cast 19 spells.

02:24:10.653 --> 02:24:11.564
LAURA: No I haven't! I've--

02:24:11.564 --> 02:24:12.915
MATT: Add your wisdom modifier.

02:24:12.915 --> 02:24:20.165
LAURA: That's good. Oh my god, that's-- what is
that, 23?

02:24:20.165 --> 02:24:25.673
MATT: Bubble vanishes. Nott, you fall to your
feet. The guy with the chains is going to go ahead and

02:24:25.673 --> 02:24:31.665
reach out to attempt to grapple you with them.
Make an acrobatics check. That was cocked.

02:24:31.706 --> 02:24:32.998
SAM: Acrobatics?

02:24:32.998 --> 02:24:33.754
MATT: Yes.

02:24:33.754 --> 02:24:34.472
SAM: 17.

02:24:34.472 --> 02:24:35.397
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:24:35.397 --> 02:24:37.871
MATT: 17? 15. You slip out of it in time. Roll a
d20.

02:24:37.871 --> 02:24:40.247
LAURA: Oh, I might Blink again! Jesus!

02:24:40.247 --> 02:24:41.348
MARISHA: You guys, get out of this.

02:24:41.348 --> 02:24:42.208
LAURA: Seven!

02:24:42.208 --> 02:24:43.114
MARISHA: Aw, shit.

02:24:43.114 --> 02:24:44.857
LAURA: Run! Oh shit!

02:24:44.857 --> 02:24:49.405
MATT: Seven; okay. You guys start bolting. At this
point you can hear footsteps coming from the other

02:24:49.405 --> 02:24:54.862
entrance hall as more folks are coming in to join
the chaos, what are you doing? Just full dash?

02:24:54.910 --> 02:24:56.642
LAURA: Full dash. Full dash?

02:24:56.655 --> 02:24:59.024
SAM: Full dash, yes. Full dash.

02:24:59.024 --> 02:25:00.217
MATT: All right, Laura, roll a d20.

02:25:00.217 --> 02:25:02.490
LAURA: Oh god. 12.

02:25:02.490 --> 02:25:07.572
MATT: As you are running, Jester disappears.

02:25:07.572 --> 02:25:13.518
SAM: I don't know where she went!

02:25:13.518 --> 02:25:14.650
LAURA: Just go!

02:25:14.650 --> 02:25:22.419
SAM: I'm going to run another 15 feet. Does anyone
have eyes on me right now?

02:25:22.470 --> 02:25:27.646
MATT: Everyone behind you has eyes on you, and
you're about to come back into the center of the

02:25:27.695 --> 02:25:32.770
temple where there are two hallways that exit to
the front and the back. The right and the left

02:25:32.770 --> 02:25:38.189
both exit the temple, but you also hear footsteps
coming from somewhere. What are you doing?

02:25:38.189 --> 02:25:39.761
SAM: Oh my god.

02:25:39.761 --> 02:25:44.081
LIAM: Somewhere in another part of the city
entirely, Caleb's going: Oh, that's interesting.

02:25:44.081 --> 02:25:48.249
SAM: I will full dash and get out of there, and
turn left.

02:25:48.249 --> 02:25:53.448
MATT: Okay. Using your bonus action, you scoot
past, turn left, and see two crownsguard that are

02:25:53.448 --> 02:26:00.271
approaching now, hearing this commotion, and you
scoot past them. "Hey!" They're unable to catch up

02:26:00.271 --> 02:26:04.739
to you, you're too fast, but they're giving chase.
Laura, you reappear ten feet from where you were.

02:26:04.739 --> 02:26:09.646
You are now again in the center of the temple, and
there's a wave of people rushing towards you.

02:26:09.646 --> 02:26:13.828
There's now two crownsguard rushing towards the
direction where Nott is, and you see Nott tearing

02:26:13.828 --> 02:26:14.897
ass away.

02:26:14.897 --> 02:26:21.576
MARISHA: You know in Matrix 2, that overhead shot
of all the agents filling into the center? That's

02:26:21.576 --> 02:26:24.974
what I imagine: waves and waves of agents.

02:26:24.974 --> 02:26:26.447
TRAVIS: Do you still look like the lord of the--

02:26:26.447 --> 02:26:27.462
MATT: Yep!

02:26:27.462 --> 02:26:35.342
LAURA: I've got one more 2nd-level spell left. I'm
going to cast Mirror Image on myself.

02:26:35.342 --> 02:26:43.525
MATT: Okay. Now there are multiple copies of the
Herald of the House Kumas. It's an army of old

02:26:43.525 --> 02:26:46.189
dudes, old dragonborns.

02:26:46.189 --> 02:26:53.378
LAURA: I take off running towards wherever the
smallest amount of people coming--

02:26:53.378 --> 02:26:57.279
MATT: That would be to the right, the opposite
direction that Nott went. You charge that

02:26:57.279 --> 02:27:00.633
direction. You move the rest of your movement that
way 30 feet. Roll another d20.

02:27:00.633 --> 02:27:05.537
LAURA: I'm using all my 20s here. 12, shit!

02:27:05.537 --> 02:27:09.733
TRAVIS: Two steps!

02:27:09.733 --> 02:27:11.609
LIAM: Wait, they all blink out?

02:27:11.609 --> 02:27:13.565
LAURA: Do my Mirror Images blink out too?

02:27:13.565 --> 02:27:16.727
MATT: Yeah, they all do, because you're not
present.

02:27:16.727 --> 02:27:17.790
LAURA: Oh god!

02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:23.482
MATT: Nott, you've managed to make it out into the
street now. You are now out of the temple.

02:27:23.482 --> 02:27:27.394
SAM: I'm going to duck behind something and look
to see if Jester came out.

02:27:27.394 --> 02:27:32.125
MATT: Make a stealth check to see if you can manage
to lose the folks that are chasing you into the street.

02:27:32.168 --> 02:27:34.179
TALIESIN: That, you have advantage on.

02:27:34.179 --> 02:27:38.156
SAM: 25.

02:27:38.156 --> 02:27:49.367
MATT: You manage to dodge over a few rain barrels
on the side, dart down one alleyway, and circle

02:27:49.367 --> 02:27:54.014
around once and duck beneath a parked wagon.
You're pretty sure they've lost you. They're now

02:27:54.014 --> 02:27:57.150
starting to scatter and give orders off in
different directions. You've caused quite a

02:27:57.150 --> 02:28:03.700
commotion. Jester, you've returned into place. Your
first time using Blink and you're like, "Oh god!

02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:04.626
"What's happening?!"

02:28:04.626 --> 02:28:06.256
LAURA: Ah! I take off running again.

02:28:06.256 --> 02:28:08.228
TALIESIN: Mirror Images going everywhere.

02:28:08.228 --> 02:28:13.255
LAURA: Yeah, right. Oh god, but if I get a double
dash, I can get farther away, right?

02:28:13.255 --> 02:28:14.643
MATT: Yep.

02:28:14.691 --> 02:28:16.111
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to double dash.

02:28:16.111 --> 02:28:20.686
MATT: That's a full 60 feet of movement as you're
rushing down the other hallway. You hear the

02:28:20.686 --> 02:28:25.984
voices behind you shouting, "There he is! Keep
going! How are there so many of him?! What's

02:28:25.984 --> 02:28:29.480
"going on?!" Roll another d20.

02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:34.990
LAURA: Oh god, okay. Five. Keep running.

02:28:34.990 --> 02:28:37.488
MATT: You keep running and make your way out now
into the night air.

02:28:37.488 --> 02:28:39.157
LAURA: I drop Blink.

02:28:39.157 --> 02:28:40.998
MATT: Okay, you drop Blink, spell's gone.

02:28:40.998 --> 02:28:44.867
LAURA: I drop Disguise Self.

02:28:44.867 --> 02:28:50.327
MATT: The guards are now rushing up and coming to
the edge of the exit and they can see you now.

02:28:50.327 --> 02:28:54.911
LAURA: Oh, they can see me? Can I turn a corner
and drop Disguise Self?

02:28:54.911 --> 02:28:57.319
MATT: You could try, but they still have eyes
trained on you.

02:28:57.319 --> 02:29:01.703
LAURA: Oh god, I'm not going to drop Disguise
Self, then. I'm going to keep going. I want to do

02:29:01.703 --> 02:29:03.842
it as soon as I'm out of eyeshot for a split
second.

02:29:03.842 --> 02:29:07.547
MATT: You've got to try and find a way to break
eye contact with them, but they're pretty trained

02:29:07.592 --> 02:29:08.893
on you right now.

02:29:08.893 --> 02:29:12.051
LAURA: Oh! Can I Invoke Duplicity? No, I already
did it. I get it twice!

02:29:12.051 --> 02:29:15.190
MATT: You do get it twice. You get Channel
Divinity twice.

02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:20.747
LAURA: Yeah! So I want to Invoke Duplicity again.
Oh, wait! I have something where I can turn

02:29:20.747 --> 02:29:23.036
invisible!

02:29:23.081 --> 02:29:24.327
MATT: That's right!

02:29:24.327 --> 02:29:26.060
LAURA: I just got it! I'm going to use it!

02:29:26.060 --> 02:29:33.815
MATT: The Cloak of Shadows thing? All right, cool.
As they're chasing, you Channel Divinity. You give

02:29:33.815 --> 02:29:36.921
a silent little whispered prayer to the Traveler
to give you the opportunity to escape.

02:29:36.921 --> 02:29:38.221
LAURA: Please don't fuck me!

02:29:38.221 --> 02:29:42.017
MATT: You vanish. You are invisible for the next
six seconds.

02:29:42.017 --> 02:29:44.693
LAURA: I run as fast as I can and turn a corner.

02:29:44.693 --> 02:29:53.752
MATT: Okay, and with that, you duck around into a
little nook on the outside of an abode or home

02:29:53.752 --> 02:29:58.129
that's placed here on the outside of the temple.
In that moment, make a stealth check with

02:29:58.129 --> 02:30:01.760
advantage, because you're invisible.

02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:03.043
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:30:03.043 --> 02:30:04.186
MATT: Okay.

02:30:04.186 --> 02:30:06.986
(laughter)

02:30:06.986 --> 02:30:12.337
MATT: You hear the voices of the crownsguard going
on like, "What--where-- Spread out! Where did you

02:30:12.337 --> 02:30:17.929
"see them go?" "I didn't see. They just vanished!"
"This is ridiculous. We're all going to get into

02:30:17.929 --> 02:30:22.818
"serious trouble if we don't find them." They all
begin to scatter about, and you begin to weave

02:30:22.818 --> 02:30:28.196
your way through some of the nearby alleyways into
the shadows of the night. Yeah, that invisibility

02:30:28.196 --> 02:30:31.140
completely cut off their eyeline to keep following
you.

02:30:31.140 --> 02:30:33.069
LIAM: Got any spell slots left?

02:30:33.069 --> 02:30:37.387
LAURA: I do. I'm going to change Disguise Self and
make myself look like a little beggar human girl,

02:30:37.387 --> 02:30:39.327
and I'm going to walk.

02:30:39.327 --> 02:30:42.480
MATT: With that, you manage to slowly blend back
into the night chaos.

02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:49.223
TRAVIS: That is easily the most fucked two
characters have ever been, to a full reversal!

02:30:49.223 --> 02:30:53.502
That is the deepest fuckage we've ever dipped a
toe in.

02:30:53.502 --> 02:30:55.456
LIAM: Not since Scanbo, I think.

02:30:55.456 --> 02:30:58.926
LAURA: Oh my god!

02:30:58.926 --> 02:31:03.617
TRAVIS: Keyleth getting arrested, I don't give a
shit. You guys were fucked.

02:31:03.617 --> 02:31:05.303
LAURA: I probably should have stayed up on the
dragon there.

02:31:05.303 --> 02:31:09.841
LIAM: That is also the most exciting night Kumas
has had in ten years.

02:31:09.841 --> 02:31:17.748
MATT: Oh, yeah! I'll say that, within the next
couple of days, word has gotten around the city of

02:31:17.748 --> 02:31:27.457
Zadash, to the point where some of the town criers
are talking about, "Terrible vandalism! Platinum

02:31:27.457 --> 02:31:35.877
"Dragon nearly ruined by upstarts and secret cabal
of anti-religious hate!"

02:31:35.877 --> 02:31:39.768
TRAVIS: (laughing) Secret cabal, because there
are so many of them!

02:31:39.768 --> 02:31:46.070
MATT: As your evening comes to a close and you go
back to The Leaky Tap to go for a rest, you have a

02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:57.181
moment to yourself to think and have a moment to
breathe and gain a little bit of calm. You sense a

02:31:57.181 --> 02:32:05.629
presence. Sitting on the bed next to you, you see
the familiar dark green cloak.

02:32:05.629 --> 02:32:17.371
LAURA: Hi. Did you see what I did?

02:32:17.371 --> 02:32:23.243
MATT: "I did."

02:32:23.243 --> 02:32:26.754
LAURA: Do you like me again?

02:32:26.754 --> 02:32:35.898
MATT: "I was never disappointed in the first
place, Jester." The hood still obscuring most of

02:32:35.898 --> 02:32:40.352
the face, just the lower jaw and mouth visible.

02:32:40.352 --> 02:32:47.745
LAURA: Why didn't you come?

02:32:47.745 --> 02:32:52.095
MATT: "I did."

02:32:52.095 --> 02:32:55.003
LAURA: I didn't see you.

02:32:55.003 --> 02:33:01.980
MATT: "You don't need to see me to know that I'm
with you. And you're free now."

02:33:01.980 --> 02:33:12.539
LAURA: Yeah. You promise you won't leave?

02:33:12.539 --> 02:33:38.703
MATT: "As long as you continue to be that
wonderful little seed of joy and chaos in the

02:33:38.703 --> 02:33:44.675
"world, I'll be walking behind you the entire
time."

02:33:44.675 --> 02:33:50.610
LAURA: If things had gotten really bad, though,
you would have stepped in, right? You wouldn't

02:33:50.610 --> 02:33:53.265
have let something really bad happen?

02:33:53.265 --> 02:33:56.453
MATT: "Not within my power, no."

02:33:56.453 --> 02:34:01.862
LAURA: Okay.

02:34:01.862 --> 02:34:05.042
MATT: "I do appreciate your artwork."

02:34:05.042 --> 02:34:07.892
LAURA: I think he looks better now.

02:34:07.892 --> 02:34:21.891
MATT: "You're improving. Keep meeting new people.
Tell them of what we have accomplished. We want

02:34:21.891 --> 02:34:23.558
"more friends, don't we?"

02:34:23.558 --> 02:34:25.036
LAURA: So many.

02:34:25.036 --> 02:34:36.425
MATT: "Do you think I could have a look at that
strange relic?"

02:34:36.425 --> 02:34:42.456
LAURA: Which one? We found a lot of relics.

02:34:42.456 --> 02:34:50.511
MATT: "The one that you procured from that
Xhorhasian warrior."

02:34:50.511 --> 02:34:56.689
LAURA: Oh, the box? Yeah, of course. I dig into
the haversack and show it to him.

02:34:56.689 --> 02:35:01.047
MATT: He extends his hand and takes it and looks
to it.

02:35:01.047 --> 02:35:03.002
LAURA: What do you think it is?

02:35:03.002 --> 02:35:10.538
MATT: You see the side of the mouth of the
Traveler curl into an amused smirk. "Curious.

02:35:10.538 --> 02:35:13.387
"Curious, indeed."

02:35:13.387 --> 02:35:20.517
LAURA: He said something about having babies or
something with it. I can't remember.

02:35:20.517 --> 02:35:26.498
MATT: "I don't think I've ever come across magic
like that."

02:35:26.498 --> 02:35:31.387
LAURA: What kind of magic is it?

02:35:31.387 --> 02:35:39.450
MATT: "I don't know. I've not come across it
before. I'm interested, definitely. Be careful

02:35:39.450 --> 02:35:49.245
"with that. Things that are unknown are notably
able to draw dangerous and inquiring eyes and minds."

02:35:49.245 --> 02:35:52.166
LAURA: So I should keep it hidden?

02:35:52.166 --> 02:35:53.895
MATT: "I think you should."

02:35:53.895 --> 02:35:58.432
LAURA: I'll keep it in this pink bag. It's very
discreet.

02:35:58.432 --> 02:36:08.565
MATT: "There are more like you out there."

02:36:08.565 --> 02:36:11.387
LAURA: I saw a couple medallions for you.

02:36:11.387 --> 02:36:19.293
MATT: "Well, I am worth worshipping, after all."

02:36:19.293 --> 02:36:21.180
LAURA: Obviously.

02:36:21.180 --> 02:36:22.867
MATT: "But you are my favorite."

02:36:22.867 --> 02:36:24.346
LAURA: I was going to ask if I was!

02:36:24.346 --> 02:36:29.057
MATT: "I hope that maybe you could all meet
someday."

02:36:29.057 --> 02:36:39.404
LAURA: I would love that. I, of course, will be
the leader of your worship, obviously.

02:36:39.404 --> 02:36:52.052
MATT: "Perhaps sometime next year. For the day of
the Zenith in Undillar. Yes, I think that."

02:36:52.052 --> 02:37:02.006
LAURA: I'm writing it in my sketchbook. Will you
tell them? And then I'll meet them there?

02:37:02.006 --> 02:37:04.904
MATT: "They all speak to me."

02:37:04.904 --> 02:37:16.073
LAURA: Okay. Wow. Thanks, thank you. Thank you,
Traveler.

02:37:16.073 --> 02:37:36.124
MATT: The hand reaches out and touches yours. You
can feel the contact, but it's strangely cold. You

02:37:36.124 --> 02:37:38.705
blink, and the Traveler's gone.

02:37:38.705 --> 02:37:51.272
LAURA: (sighs) I draw so many things in my
sketchbook. All of it.

02:37:51.272 --> 02:37:53.965
MATT: All right.

02:37:53.965 --> 02:37:58.323
MARISHA: (whispering) He's organizing Traveler
Con.

02:37:58.323 --> 02:38:01.403
(laughter)

02:38:01.403 --> 02:38:02.615
LAURA: Okay, now I've got to go feed the baby.

02:38:03.956 --> 02:38:07.215
MATT: Yeah. Now, let's take a break. I didn't
realize the time had gone by quite so far. My

02:38:07.215 --> 02:38:08.395
apologies, people.

02:38:08.395 --> 02:38:10.497
LIAM: It's almost like a game of D&amp;D.

02:38:10.497 --> 02:38:15.355
MATT: I know, it's crazy. We won't have quite as
long a second half. Probably much at all. But

02:38:15.395 --> 02:38:19.450
yeah, we'll take a break here. For those who are
interested in being part of the giveaway

02:38:19.450 --> 02:38:28.158
tonight, we have this fantastic cherry dice tower
system with cartography from our fantastic,

02:38:28.284 --> 02:38:32.475
talented friend, Deven Rue, who did our Wildemount
campaign guide. It has this really awesome leather

02:38:32.475 --> 02:38:41.834
dragon face bind to it. The cartography that's
been burned into it that is gorgeous. So this dice

02:38:41.834 --> 02:38:49.847
tower-- oh, it smells good. You can be a part of
this-- apparently this is on Kickstarter now, so

02:38:49.847 --> 02:38:53.834
you can check that out with our friends at
Wyrmwood as part of the giveaway. You have to head

02:38:53.834 --> 02:38:58.232
over to the Critical Role chatroom on Twitch,
that's twitch.tv/criticalrole to enter. The

02:38:58.232 --> 02:39:01.713
keyword tonight-- which you only enter once, any
more than that and you'll get disqualified-- the

02:39:01.713 --> 02:39:05.424
keyword is "chapter." Just the word "chapter."
We'll come back from the break with one winner,

02:39:05.424 --> 02:39:07.830
here, announced, so we'll see you here in a few
minutes.

02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:13.092
MATT: Welcome back. Before we get back into this,
we have our winner of the giveaway, of the fantastic

02:39:13.147 --> 02:39:23.249
Deven Rue-carved cherry wood dice tower system.
The winner is Mellydew. Congratulations. We'll get

02:39:23.249 --> 02:39:28.467
your info and get this sent out to you ASAP, so
thank you for being a part. Laura will be joining

02:39:28.467 --> 02:39:30.041
us shortly; she's finishing feeding the baby.

02:39:30.041 --> 02:39:31.541
TRAVIS: Yeah, feed the baby, give it life.

02:39:31.541 --> 02:39:33.663
LIAM: Feed me!

02:39:33.663 --> 02:39:41.434
MATT: It works out okay. Having all spent the
majority of these two weeks handling your

02:39:41.434 --> 02:39:50.892
business, wandering through Zadash and beyond,
returning, what do you wish to do? You guys have

02:39:50.892 --> 02:39:52.710
regathered in the Leaky Tap.

02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:58.226
TALIESIN: (groaning) I'm going to pretend to be a
small, old platinum dragon.

02:39:58.226 --> 02:40:01.239
SAM: He's out, get him!

02:40:01.239 --> 02:40:03.262
LIAM: (as Kumas) I want rice pudding!

02:40:03.262 --> 02:40:07.656
TRAVIS: An uneventful two weeks for everyone, I
assume?

02:40:07.656 --> 02:40:08.822
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:40:08.822 --> 02:40:10.760
SAM: Not much happened.

02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:12.475
MARISHA: Nah, not a lot to report.

02:40:12.475 --> 02:40:14.839
LIAM: I got a lot of reading done.

02:40:14.839 --> 02:40:18.087
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good. New books?

02:40:18.087 --> 02:40:23.336
LIAM: Oh, library books, so they're not mine.
That's the beauty of a library.

02:40:23.336 --> 02:40:28.196
TRAVIS: Right. Beau, you look like you got a
couple new little marks and stuff.

02:40:28.196 --> 02:40:33.563
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Just, you know, I think I can
punch ghosts now.

02:40:33.563 --> 02:40:37.262
TALIESIN: A lot of ghosts need punching?

02:40:37.262 --> 02:40:41.436
MARISHA: Have you ever met a ghost that doesn't
need punching?

02:40:41.436 --> 02:40:43.946
LIAM: Is this a realization that you had?

02:40:43.946 --> 02:40:46.519
TRAVIS: Yeah, I never even met a ghost. How would
you punch it?

02:40:46.519 --> 02:40:52.496
MARISHA: I just know if I saw a ghost, I would
want to punch it. Ghosts are scary.

02:40:52.496 --> 02:40:54.205
TRAVIS: Okay. Nott?

02:40:54.205 --> 02:40:56.040
SAM: What?

02:40:56.040 --> 02:40:58.064
TRAVIS: How was your--?

02:40:58.064 --> 02:41:00.771
SAM: I did a lot of drinking.

02:41:00.771 --> 02:41:02.538
TRAVIS: Yeah?

02:41:02.538 --> 02:41:04.823
SAM: Yep. Just drinking and thinking.

02:41:04.823 --> 02:41:05.997
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:41:05.997 --> 02:41:11.846
LIAM: You were off on your own. Are you okay?

02:41:11.846 --> 02:41:15.644
SAM: Yeah, a little bit. You know, it's easier to
steal things when you can pay for them with

02:41:15.644 --> 02:41:16.657
money.

02:41:16.657 --> 02:41:18.517
LIAM: That's true.

02:41:18.517 --> 02:41:21.422
TRAVIS: Caduceus?

02:41:21.422 --> 02:41:22.982
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:41:22.982 --> 02:41:24.366
TRAVIS: How was your time?

02:41:24.366 --> 02:41:29.088
TALIESIN: Yes. I've met a ghost that I didn't want
to punch.

02:41:29.088 --> 02:41:31.075
MARISHA: You have met a ghost you didn't want to
punch.

02:41:31.075 --> 02:41:34.547
TALIESIN: Yeah. I thought of one. Oh, what?

02:41:34.547 --> 02:41:37.914
TRAVIS: Have you met more than one ghost before?

02:41:37.914 --> 02:41:39.351
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.

02:41:39.351 --> 02:41:49.700
MARISHA: Oh, you didn't get to see where we found
this guy. It was definitely a cemetery. He was

02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:51.423
living in the middle of a cemetery.

02:41:51.423 --> 02:41:55.498
TRAVIS: You don't have to tell me any more, it's
fine. I'll just imagine the worst possible--

02:41:55.498 --> 02:42:01.242
TALIESIN: That's where the temple is, in the
middle of the cemetery. Actually, technically it's

02:42:01.242 --> 02:42:03.893
not a cemetery. It's a graveyard.

02:42:03.893 --> 02:42:07.516
MARISHA: Okay, there's a difference?

02:42:07.516 --> 02:42:10.617
TALIESIN: Graveyard has an attached temple,
cemetery is just by itself.

02:42:10.617 --> 02:42:13.369
SAM: I did not know that.

02:42:13.369 --> 02:42:17.079
TALIESIN: Yeah. I know a couple things.

02:42:17.079 --> 02:42:28.582
TRAVIS: I have a request. Upon further inspection
of this here letter, Quen'pillar is the month that

02:42:28.582 --> 02:42:31.325
we're in, which we all know, right?

02:42:31.325 --> 02:42:34.703
TALIESIN: Is it Quen'pillar already?

02:42:34.703 --> 02:42:36.960
TRAVIS: It is. How time flies.

02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:42.613
MARISHA: They're going to start putting up Winter
Crest decorations in the stores. We have to start

02:42:42.613 --> 02:42:44.512
thinking about what we're going to get each
other.

02:42:44.512 --> 02:42:46.142
TALIESIN: Two weeks earlier every year.

02:42:46.142 --> 02:42:53.516
TRAVIS: While I have no idea who Marius LePual or
Evantica or any of this is, this was supposed to

02:42:53.516 --> 02:42:57.295
be delivered by the end of this month to the
Wayfarer's Cove.

02:42:57.295 --> 02:42:59.502
TALIESIN: What's the Wayfarer's Cove?

02:42:59.502 --> 02:43:03.511
TRAVIS: It's back in-- help me?

02:43:03.511 --> 02:43:04.664
MATT: The Menagerie Coast.

02:43:04.664 --> 02:43:07.680
TRAVIS: The Menagerie Coast. Where Jester and I
are from.

02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:09.155
LIAM: Is it an actual cove?

02:43:09.155 --> 02:43:10.762
MARISHA: Have you been there?

02:43:10.762 --> 02:43:15.448
TRAVIS: I have. Nicodranas is where Jester's from,
I'm from Port Damali.

02:43:15.448 --> 02:43:18.243
MARISHA: And you don't know any of these people?

02:43:18.243 --> 02:43:20.307
TRAVIS: I don't. I don't?

02:43:20.307 --> 02:43:21.538
MATT: You don't.

02:43:21.538 --> 02:43:22.510
TRAVIS: I don't.

02:43:22.510 --> 02:43:26.311
TALIESIN: You talking about making a trip? Taking
off?

02:43:26.311 --> 02:43:34.221
TRAVIS: I was thinking about it. I journeyed a
little further south. I'm actually looking for

02:43:34.221 --> 02:43:40.040
someone and I had been meaning to head back that
way, anyway. If this is taking us in that

02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:45.519
direction, if it'll teach us anything more about
the, you know, (grunting).

02:43:45.519 --> 02:43:52.432
MARISHA: Yeah. That definitely looks like it, too.
Looks a lot like what sucked into your body. That

02:43:52.432 --> 02:43:53.491
was a weird night.

02:43:53.491 --> 02:43:54.549
TRAVIS: Yes, it was.

02:43:54.549 --> 02:43:57.153
TALIESIN: Is that like a peach pit or something?

02:43:57.153 --> 02:43:59.179
LIAM: An abused cantaloupe.

02:43:59.179 --> 02:44:00.853
TALIESIN: Oh, that'll happen.

02:44:00.853 --> 02:44:01.912
MARISHA: An angry marble.

02:44:01.912 --> 02:44:06.241
TALIESIN: I don't know why that's somehow weirder
than abused cantaloupe.

02:44:06.241 --> 02:44:09.637
SAM: Ill-tempered bowling ball.

02:44:09.637 --> 02:44:12.072
(laughter)

02:44:12.072 --> 02:44:13.586
MARISHA: You get the picture.

02:44:13.586 --> 02:44:18.350
TRAVIS: Either way, I don't feel very comfortable
with it residing in my person.

02:44:18.350 --> 02:44:23.029
MARISHA: How do you feel, actually? Do you feel
it?

02:44:23.029 --> 02:44:34.103
TRAVIS: Nope, I just feel like me. It was the
vision that came with it that fucked me up a

02:44:34.103 --> 02:44:35.577
little bit.

02:44:35.577 --> 02:44:38.481
MARISHA: Did you have any more visions when you
were captured?

02:44:38.481 --> 02:44:46.019
TRAVIS: No, but I just kept replaying it over and
over. It was dark for so long, and there was

02:44:46.019 --> 02:44:52.117
nothing really to distract you. I just kept seeing
his face, and him holding the orb and pushing it

02:44:52.117 --> 02:44:56.231
into his, or my chest, and the body on the
ground.

02:44:56.231 --> 02:44:57.877
MARISHA: Jesus.

02:44:57.877 --> 02:44:58.989
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:44:58.989 --> 02:45:07.088
TALIESIN: I'm not having visions right now, so I'm
happy to follow another one. This is not where I'm

02:45:07.088 --> 02:45:08.648
supposed to be.

02:45:08.648 --> 02:45:14.120
MARISHA: Thanks, Caduceus.

02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:15.862
TRAVIS: Does he say stuff like that a lot?

02:45:15.862 --> 02:45:17.412
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:45:17.412 --> 02:45:28.670
SAM: I'm happy to entertain your desire to go find
out more about this ball inside of you, but

02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:31.749
there's other things we might want to do, too.

02:45:31.749 --> 02:45:33.201
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah.

02:45:33.201 --> 02:45:40.358
SAM: Caleb, you have things that you wanted to
accomplish to the north, right?

02:45:40.358 --> 02:45:51.849
LIAM: Oh, no. No, I have no specific destination
in mind. I'm happy to accompany you if the group

02:45:51.849 --> 02:45:53.822
sees fit.

02:45:53.822 --> 02:45:58.707
MARISHA: Have you ever been to the Menagerie
Coast? How far south have you been?

02:45:58.707 --> 02:46:00.481
LIAM: No, I have never been out of the Empire.

02:46:00.481 --> 02:46:01.949
MARISHA: Yeah, me neither.

02:46:01.949 --> 02:46:05.318
TRAVIS: It's warmer, and there's certainly less
snow.

02:46:05.318 --> 02:46:11.330
MARISHA: That's a plus, you guys! Going in the
wintertime kind of sucks.

02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:13.134
TALIESIN: I'm already sold.

02:46:13.134 --> 02:46:16.996
MARISHA: Plus, further away from the frontlines in
this war.

02:46:16.996 --> 02:46:19.028
LIAM: What about you?

02:46:19.028 --> 02:46:40.997
SAM: Me? I'll go where you go, Caleb. I worry
about a couple things. Yasha said she'd come back

02:46:40.997 --> 02:46:48.236
when she was ready, and if we're not here, then I
don't know how she'll find us.

02:46:48.284 --> 02:46:53.170
MARISHA: I feel like her and Molly always had a
connection. She always knew how to find us because

02:46:53.170 --> 02:46:54.584
she knew how to find Molly.

02:46:54.584 --> 02:46:58.319
SAM: We could leave word, I suppose.

02:46:58.319 --> 02:46:59.631
MARISHA: What?!

02:46:59.631 --> 02:47:01.864
LIAM: Can't Jester send messages?

02:47:01.864 --> 02:47:03.513
TALIESIN: Finding Molly's all about who you know.

02:47:03.513 --> 02:47:05.169
SAM: Yes, Jester could send her a message.

02:47:05.169 --> 02:47:08.837
MARISHA: Your past self isn't allowed to laugh at
current things.

02:47:08.837 --> 02:47:10.775
TALIESIN: I'm having a weird-- yes.

02:47:10.775 --> 02:47:12.832
MARISHA: No reactions from Molly here.

02:47:12.832 --> 02:47:17.686
MATT: Are you drinking from a Caduceus mug?

02:47:17.686 --> 02:47:19.536
TALIESIN: Maybe, you don't know.

02:47:19.536 --> 02:47:21.243
MATT: I love that. That's amazing.

02:47:21.243 --> 02:47:22.939
MARISHA: It's so great.

02:47:22.939 --> 02:47:24.780
TRAVIS: Who are you drinking?

02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:27.231
LIAM: (shouting) Who are you drinking?

02:47:27.231 --> 02:47:36.680
SAM: If we could send Yasha a message, that would
be better.

02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:51.428
TRAVIS: I previously wanted to go north to the
Soltryce Academy, but I feel like that's another

02:47:51.428 --> 02:47:56.303
step in the direction that's not pressing for
right now.

02:47:56.303 --> 02:48:01.262
MARISHA: Plus, it sounds like, gauging by this
letter, someone's going to catch up with us sooner

02:48:01.262 --> 02:48:03.645
or later looking for whatever's inside of you.

02:48:03.645 --> 02:48:08.531
TRAVIS: Yeah. There's no telling that they're going to
share any information with me, anyway. I'm fucking

02:48:08.531 --> 02:48:16.037
absorbing things and shit just appears and I'm
getting stronger by the day and it has nothing to

02:48:16.037 --> 02:48:22.451
do with the things that I'm learning. There's no
books or knowledge, it's just happening. What if

02:48:22.451 --> 02:48:31.276
they look at me like you guys look at me
sometimes? What if they don't let me go? Maybe

02:48:31.276 --> 02:48:33.109
that's not where I need to be.

02:48:33.109 --> 02:48:38.634
MARISHA: How we look at you sometimes? Like you're
awesome? Like we're awestruck?

02:48:38.634 --> 02:48:40.163
TRAVIS: Like weird shit is happening.

02:48:40.163 --> 02:48:42.629
MARISHA: That's accurate, yeah, I do look at you
like that sometimes.

02:48:42.629 --> 02:48:45.939
LIAM: And not very explained at all.

02:48:45.939 --> 02:48:52.370
TRAVIS: It's hard when you're the only one
experiencing it. It's hard to relay.

02:48:52.370 --> 02:48:56.861
LIAM: Well, what if you tried?

02:48:56.861 --> 02:49:00.944
TRAVIS: I'm certainly open to that.

02:49:00.944 --> 02:49:03.363
LIAM: How about right now?

02:49:03.363 --> 02:49:05.247
TRAVIS: What do you want to know?

02:49:05.247 --> 02:49:13.484
LIAM: Is there any of this that you have not
shared yet?

02:49:13.484 --> 02:49:24.754
TRAVIS: No, I don't believe so. I did tell Molly
before we were taken about a crewmate of mine

02:49:24.754 --> 02:49:32.872
named Sabian. He was the one that ambushed the
ship, that caused the explosion that threw me

02:49:32.872 --> 02:49:41.443
overboard. The one that probably sent Vandren to
his fate. After I woke up on the shore afterwards,

02:49:41.443 --> 02:49:48.314
I found the sword and I wasn't quite sure where I
was. I found a road and managed to hitch a ride

02:49:48.314 --> 02:49:58.204
back towards Port Damali, and when I got there I
went to Vandren's storehouse, and I planned to go

02:49:58.204 --> 02:50:03.720
through his things. I was more high up on the crew
than Sabian was, but his place had been ransacked.

02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:13.906
Gone through. Torn through. There was a local
butcher next door that I walked into, and he had

02:50:13.906 --> 02:50:19.502
said that he was glad to see at least one other
of us, that no one else had returned. I said: Who

02:50:19.502 --> 02:50:27.075
was the other one? He had said Sabian. So I feel
like he somehow survived. He knows what happened,

02:50:27.075 --> 02:50:35.912
why it happened. I can't bear the thought of
something happening to me because I'm pursuing

02:50:35.912 --> 02:50:39.841
this. And I summon the sword.

02:50:39.841 --> 02:50:47.998
MATT: You see as the blade now is this unique
merger of the falchion shape and size, but now

02:50:47.998 --> 02:50:55.523
holds this golden tint of the Summer's Dance. It
curves towards the edge and has a slight pointed

02:50:55.523 --> 02:51:03.547
jagged arch in the back that the scimitar had
previously held. But still contains the

02:51:03.547 --> 02:51:09.982
barnacle-encrusted pattern across the hilt and
there in the center still is the central yellow

02:51:09.982 --> 02:51:11.503
gleaming eye.

02:51:11.503 --> 02:51:18.303
TRAVIS: I don't want to be focused on this. I want
to be focused on that. Plus, I feel like if those

02:51:18.303 --> 02:51:23.008
events led to this, maybe there's a remedy for the
whole thing.

02:51:23.008 --> 02:51:29.584
MARISHA: So you want to find Sabian and hope that
he has the answers?

02:51:29.584 --> 02:51:34.816
TRAVIS: Or just kill him. That'd be fine. But
yeah, maybe some answers first.

02:51:34.816 --> 02:51:39.111
MARISHA: And you're sure this motherfucker was,
like, sole sabotager?

02:51:39.111 --> 02:51:52.021
TRAVIS: He and I have a long history. But, after
he-- So we were in the storm. He ran belowdecks,

02:51:52.021 --> 02:51:58.051
and he placed a bundle next to a lot of the crates
that we were shipping. That was unusual for him,

02:51:58.051 --> 02:52:02.745
so I followed him down and I saw him with a
lantern in his hand, and when he turned he had lit

02:52:02.745 --> 02:52:08.657
what looked like a fuse. I called out, he threw a
few daggers at me. They hit; I went down, he ran

02:52:08.657 --> 02:52:14.966
past me. Just as I made my way back above decks, I
called his name and I saw him at the bow of the

02:52:14.966 --> 02:52:20.845
ship, and it looked like he was preparing to jump
overboard, which in a storm like that is insane.

02:52:20.845 --> 02:52:28.743
That's when the explosion hit. It ripped into my
back. It threw me over, and I remember going underwater

02:52:28.743 --> 02:52:34.503
and seeing parts of the ship fall, and
flames above the water. I could see things

02:52:34.503 --> 02:52:44.841
falling, and some of it was cargo, and some of it
looked like me. I just feel like he was prepared

02:52:44.841 --> 02:52:48.817
to get the hell out of Dodge.

02:52:48.817 --> 02:52:56.213
TALIESIN: Just so I'm clear, as I really feel like
I'm playing catch up, he's the one responsible for

02:52:56.213 --> 02:52:59.716
that, er, pearl that you've got in you?

02:52:59.716 --> 02:53:06.768
TRAVIS: No. My teacher and my captain, Vandren, is
the one I saw in this vision, and he had the same

02:53:06.768 --> 02:53:13.533
sphere. I saw myself through his eyes, and he was
holding the sphere and pushing it into his chest.

02:53:13.533 --> 02:53:19.869
He was also standing over a man. I saw his
reflection. He seemed younger, so I don't know

02:53:19.869 --> 02:53:29.252
when it was, but I didn't know that side of him.
He was an exacting man. Firm, but fair, and it

02:53:29.252 --> 02:53:34.130
just leaves more questions than I have answers
to.

02:53:34.130 --> 02:53:41.536
MARISHA: I mean, no offense or anything, but these
sound like some crazy-ass fucking sailors.

02:53:41.536 --> 02:53:54.587
LIAM: You speak of a remedy. How do you mean? Do
you mean you would rid yourself of that blade,

02:53:54.587 --> 02:53:59.887
these changes in you? Or am I not hitting it?

02:53:59.887 --> 02:54:10.082
TRAVIS: I honestly don't know. I've thought about
what it was like before I had this-- I'll make the

02:54:10.082 --> 02:54:21.644
sword disappear. Life was simple, but I don't feel
like I had the ability to affect my surroundings.

02:54:21.644 --> 02:54:32.073
I was not a proponent of change. It's selfish, but
I feel like I can do things now. I don't know if I

02:54:32.073 --> 02:54:40.186
would get rid of it, but I want to know what
happened to him. I owe him that much.

02:54:40.186 --> 02:54:41.888
LIAM: Oh, good morning.

02:54:41.888 --> 02:54:45.710
LAURA: Ah, it was a long night. What are you guys
talking about?

02:54:45.710 --> 02:54:49.019
LIAM: Our next destination.

02:54:49.019 --> 02:54:51.782
MARISHA: Fjord's angry marble in his chest.

02:54:51.782 --> 02:54:53.319
LAURA: Oh.

02:54:53.319 --> 02:54:58.011
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was thinking that if you wouldn't
be opposed, we could go back to the Menagerie

02:54:58.011 --> 02:55:01.436
Coast, stop by your mom's place in Nicodranas.

02:55:01.436 --> 02:55:04.109
MARISHA: Oh!

02:55:04.109 --> 02:55:09.384
LAURA: Well, I mean, I would have to like disguise
myself, but yeah. We could probably go there.

02:55:09.384 --> 02:55:10.797
MARISHA: Disguise yourself?

02:55:10.797 --> 02:55:12.333
LAURA: Well, I can't go back home.

02:55:12.333 --> 02:55:13.707
MARISHA: Oh, right.

02:55:13.707 --> 02:55:17.135
LAURA: But if you want to go to the Menagerie
Coast, you know I'm always on board for that,

02:55:17.135 --> 02:55:18.942
Fjord. But what about the Academy?

02:55:18.942 --> 02:55:25.507
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was telling them I feel like
instruction isn't exactly what I need; it's not

02:55:25.507 --> 02:55:34.230
going to get me anything, yet. I just feel like I
need to take steps in the right direction, does

02:55:34.230 --> 02:55:36.752
that make sense? Feels like I'm stalling.

02:55:36.752 --> 02:55:38.891
TALIESIN: Also the deal with his little--

02:55:38.891 --> 02:55:42.804
TRAVIS: Yeah, the letter does say the Wayfarer's
Cove and it says it's supposed to be delivered by

02:55:42.804 --> 02:55:46.480
the end of this month, so I feel like there's some
urgency if we're going to capitalize on

02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:49.660
intercepting this.

02:55:49.660 --> 02:55:58.487
LIAM: For what it's worth, Fjord, Soltryce Academy
normally starts with younger students. Not

02:55:58.487 --> 02:56:01.152
exclusively, but generally.

02:56:01.152 --> 02:56:10.272
TRAVIS: Oh, I hadn't realized. What if you show up
with inherent abilities?

02:56:10.272 --> 02:56:12.564
LIAM: I don't know.

02:56:12.564 --> 02:56:31.179
MARISHA: I mean, you don't want to give-- (sighs) I
think, whatever gifts you've been given, they're

02:56:31.179 --> 02:56:38.722
natural and progressive. I mean, figure that out
on your own first. You don't want to give them

02:56:38.722 --> 02:56:40.181
back, right?

02:56:40.181 --> 02:56:51.160
TRAVIS: No, certainly not yet. If it will help me
find that fuck, then I'd prefer to hold onto them.

02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:55.324
MARISHA: They're called gifts for a reason, right?
It'd be rude to give them back.

02:56:55.324 --> 02:56:59.740
TRAVIS: I don't know how I'd give it back.

02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:02.252
TALIESIN: I like that, that's really good.

02:57:02.252 --> 02:57:03.642
LAURA: Maybe you have to poop it out.

02:57:03.642 --> 02:57:04.938
SAM: Yeah, like passing a stone.

02:57:04.938 --> 02:57:08.275
TRAVIS: Poop it out?

02:57:08.275 --> 02:57:10.836
LAURA: It would really hurt, but it could happen.

02:57:10.836 --> 02:57:12.777
SAM: Could go through his pee-pee hole too.

02:57:12.777 --> 02:57:13.761
LAURA: That's true.

02:57:13.761 --> 02:57:15.181
MARISHA: Kidney stones.

02:57:15.181 --> 02:57:23.852
LAURA: You never know. Maybe somebody else has
already done what you did and they already pooped

02:57:23.852 --> 02:57:26.732
it out, and now it's in you.

02:57:26.732 --> 02:57:33.564
TRAVIS: Then I ate the poop stone. Yep. Didn't
wash it off or nothing.

02:57:33.564 --> 02:57:34.730
LAURA: Nope.

02:57:34.730 --> 02:57:36.358
TRAVIS: It was underwater, though, so--

02:57:36.358 --> 02:57:39.730
LAURA: That's true. That is true. That's probably
why it was underwater.

02:57:39.730 --> 02:57:42.900
LIAM: We're all agreed, then, that Fjord eats
poop.

02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:44.260
TRAVIS: Canon.

02:57:44.260 --> 02:57:47.019
(laughter)

02:57:47.019 --> 02:57:50.019
MATT: No, that's what would have happened if it
actually came out of your pee-hole.

02:57:50.019 --> 02:57:53.320
TRAVIS: (laughing) I poop out my pee-hole.

02:57:53.320 --> 02:57:55.304
MATT: Anyway.

02:57:55.304 --> 02:57:56.288
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:57:56.288 --> 02:58:00.275
LAURA: Menagerie Coast, then?

02:58:00.275 --> 02:58:01.497
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:58:01.497 --> 02:58:03.916
SAM: Sure.

02:58:03.916 --> 02:58:08.420
TRAVIS: I would hate to go without all of you.

02:58:08.420 --> 02:58:10.826
SAM: We stick together.

02:58:10.826 --> 02:58:17.884
LIAM: After what we have been through in the last
month, it'd seem foolish to split up now. I'm

02:58:17.884 --> 02:58:20.290
curious about the Menagerie Coast.

02:58:20.290 --> 02:58:21.445
MARISHA: Me, too.

02:58:21.445 --> 02:58:22.715
LAURA: (gasps) You guys could meet my mom!

02:58:22.715 --> 02:58:24.699
SAM: I'm excited.

02:58:24.699 --> 02:58:26.490
MARISHA: I so want to meet your mom.

02:58:26.490 --> 02:58:29.484
TRAVIS: Just to be clear, we can meet your mom,
but you can't?

02:58:29.484 --> 02:58:33.016
LAURA: I can meet her; I can see her.

02:58:33.016 --> 02:58:35.770
TRAVIS: You're just not supposed to be seen coming
back?

02:58:35.770 --> 02:58:36.745
LAURA: Exactly.

02:58:36.745 --> 02:58:37.489
TRAVIS: Got it.

02:58:37.489 --> 02:58:38.734
LIAM: She would be okay with you--

02:58:38.734 --> 02:58:40.503
LAURA: I will let her know to expect us.

02:58:40.503 --> 02:58:44.983
TRAVIS: Oh, speaking of-- Before you came down--

02:58:44.983 --> 02:58:48.837
SAM: We're going to need you to send a message to
Yasha. Do you need to know where she is to send

02:58:48.837 --> 02:58:49.862
that message?

02:58:49.862 --> 02:58:51.460
LAURA: Nope, I just need to know it's her.

02:58:51.460 --> 02:58:56.714
SAM: It might be good to let her know where we're
going, in case she wants to find us.

02:58:56.714 --> 02:59:06.567
LAURA: Okay. I send a message to Yasha. Hello,
Yasha. I'm really sorry that the last time we

02:59:06.567 --> 02:59:14.192
left, it was really hard for all of us, but we
wanted to let you know that we are probably--

02:59:14.192 --> 02:59:15.496
SAM: (clicks)

02:59:15.496 --> 02:59:17.442
TRAVIS: No destination.

02:59:17.442 --> 02:59:21.524
LAURA: I send another message to Yasha.

02:59:21.524 --> 02:59:23.065
SAM: The next day?

02:59:23.065 --> 02:59:30.590
LAURA: No, I've got three-- <i>four</i> 3rd-level
spots, I think. Four, because of my pearl. So I'm

02:59:30.590 --> 02:59:40.111
going to send another one: Sorry, I got cut off
earlier. Anyway, what I was saying is that we are

02:59:40.111 --> 02:59:45.524
leaving Zadash, and we're on our way out, over the
hills, and we're going to go to probably--

02:59:45.524 --> 02:59:46.901
SAM: (clicks)

02:59:46.901 --> 02:59:48.553
LAURA: Anyway, I get to it eventually.

02:59:48.553 --> 02:59:54.561
(laughter)

02:59:54.561 --> 02:59:56.250
MATT: Best use of Sending ever.

02:59:56.250 --> 02:59:59.122
LIAM: Seven spell slots later.

02:59:59.122 --> 03:00:03.282
SAM: (robotic voice) You have seven new messages.

03:00:03.282 --> 03:00:05.661
(laughter)

03:00:05.661 --> 03:00:09.176
LIAM: (as Jester) Okay, I'm starting at the top
again.

03:00:09.176 --> 03:00:19.249
MATT: Yasha's somewhere just going like, (sighs).
All right, have you guys decided to start making

03:00:19.249 --> 03:00:20.767
your way to the Menagerie Coast?

03:00:20.767 --> 03:00:23.235
LAURA: Wait, I got to get my handaxe first, so I
pick that up.

03:00:23.235 --> 03:00:28.549
MATT: Yeah, easy enough. Pumat's there. "Yeah, we
worked real hard on this one, so I hope you enjoy

03:00:28.549 --> 03:00:34.909
"what we've imbued into this
previously-not-very-interesting weapon to make it

03:00:34.909 --> 03:00:36.442
"just a whole lot more interesting."

03:00:36.442 --> 03:00:41.249
LAURA: It is so interesting now. Did you want to
put a ribbon on it or something to make it

03:00:41.249 --> 03:00:42.204
prettier?

03:00:42.204 --> 03:00:44.152
MATT: "Do you want to request a ribbon? We've got
multiple colors."

03:00:44.152 --> 03:00:47.074
LAURA: (gasps) What colors?

03:00:47.074 --> 03:00:49.107
MATT: Green and gold.

03:00:49.107 --> 03:00:51.302
SAM: That's multiple.

03:00:51.302 --> 03:00:52.310
MARISHA and TALIESIN: It is!

03:00:52.310 --> 03:00:53.258
TALIESIN: Technically.

03:00:53.258 --> 03:00:55.929
MATT: "By definition, respectfully, not an
incorrect statement."

03:00:55.929 --> 03:00:58.770
LAURA: Let's do-- Let's do green.

03:00:58.770 --> 03:01:00.529
MATT: "Very well."

03:01:00.529 --> 03:01:02.000
LAURA: That way it matches my cape.

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.516
MATT: He does this little nice bow.

03:01:04.516 --> 03:01:06.827
LAURA: It's really pretty, thank you.

03:01:06.827 --> 03:01:10.733
MATT: "Oh, quite literally, the very least I can
do."

03:01:10.733 --> 03:01:14.512
LAURA: What does it do?

03:01:14.512 --> 03:01:15.884
MATT: It's a plus one.

03:01:15.884 --> 03:01:16.769
LAURA: To hit?

03:01:16.769 --> 03:01:17.911
MATT: Hit and damage.

03:01:17.911 --> 03:01:18.910
LAURA: Ooh!

03:01:18.910 --> 03:01:21.077
MATT: Plus one handaxe.

03:01:21.077 --> 03:01:23.032
LAURA: Plus one handaxe, thank you.

03:01:23.032 --> 03:01:23.935
MATT: No worries.

03:01:23.935 --> 03:01:31.293
SAM: Before we set out, I'm going to pull Caleb
aside, and-- A moment, Caleb? Are you sure you

03:01:31.293 --> 03:01:38.252
want to go down to the coast? There's stuff for
you to do up north where you were from before.

03:01:38.252 --> 03:01:42.429
LIAM: It is dangerous there.

03:01:42.429 --> 03:01:49.522
SAM: Of course, but we'll have to do it at some
point. We're all together now.

03:01:49.522 --> 03:01:54.285
LIAM: Not yet.

03:01:54.285 --> 03:02:03.534
SAM: All right. I won't lie, I'm sort of-- Now
that we're all together again, I wouldn't mind

03:02:03.534 --> 03:02:06.514
swinging by my old stomping grounds either.

03:02:06.514 --> 03:02:12.977
LIAM: Where's the map? Is that on the way?

03:02:12.977 --> 03:02:18.173
SAM: It's on the way. Well, it's on <i>a</i> way north,
if we wanted to go that way.

03:02:18.173 --> 03:02:21.161
LIAM: Oh, it's to the north, it's not towards the
Menagerie Coast?

03:02:21.161 --> 03:02:23.272
SAM: No, it's more east.

03:02:23.272 --> 03:02:26.652
LIAM: Where's the map?

03:02:26.652 --> 03:02:38.782
SAM: It's east, it's due east. It's definitely not
west. We're here. It's due east, but the coast is

03:02:38.782 --> 03:02:39.895
down here?

03:02:39.895 --> 03:02:41.795
MATT: It would be a detour.

03:02:41.795 --> 03:02:46.336
TALIESIN: If you really wanted to, we could PCH
this and basically hit the coast and then take

03:02:46.336 --> 03:02:49.682
that really annoyingly long drive from San
Francisco-- but it's so pretty.

03:02:49.682 --> 03:02:51.086
MATT: There we go, there it is.

03:02:51.086 --> 03:02:52.345
MARISHA: (whispering) Thanks, Max.

03:02:52.345 --> 03:02:55.286
LIAM: Do you want to propose it to the group? I'm
happy to go, of course.

03:02:55.286 --> 03:03:04.140
SAM: I can wait. I don't mind waiting. I don't
have a specific--

03:03:04.140 --> 03:03:05.957
MARISHA: You're from Deastok?

03:03:05.957 --> 03:03:07.834
SAM: No, Felderwin.

03:03:07.834 --> 03:03:12.009
LIAM: What's the time limit on that? It's the end
of the month, right, on the delivery. And we're at

03:03:12.009 --> 03:03:13.461
the beginning of this month, or the middle--

03:03:13.461 --> 03:03:14.313
MATT: Correct.

03:03:14.313 --> 03:03:15.452
LIAM: Beginning.

03:03:15.452 --> 03:03:18.975
SAM: We'll be back this way again soon. We'll have
to come through Zadash, and we can--

03:03:18.975 --> 03:03:20.428
MARISHA: I mean--

03:03:20.428 --> 03:03:22.572
LIAM: What if that is the next place we go?

03:03:22.572 --> 03:03:26.661
MARISHA: Nott, it looks like the main road goes
through Felderwin anyway.

03:03:26.661 --> 03:03:29.335
SAM: Yeah, the main road <i>away</i> from the Menagerie
Coast.

03:03:29.335 --> 03:03:35.258
MARISHA: Yeah, but-- yep, you're right. Maybe
that's-- that's a river. That's not a road.

03:03:35.258 --> 03:03:38.919
TRAVIS: That's a big-ass road.

03:03:38.919 --> 03:03:40.226
MARISHA: That's a real big--

03:03:40.226 --> 03:03:41.564
TRAVIS: You can see that and mountains.

03:03:41.564 --> 03:03:42.982
LIAM: So much water on this road!

03:03:42.982 --> 03:03:50.399
LAURA: Before we leave, can I stop by the Pillow
Trove and let them know any mail coming for me or

03:03:50.399 --> 03:03:59.498
Ms. Lavorre, Esquire, please forward that to the
Menagerie Coast by way of Nicodranas and my mom's place?

03:03:59.498 --> 03:04:03.454
MATT: Okay. The Ruby of the Sea has been placed in
as your forwarding service.

03:04:03.454 --> 03:04:05.666
TRAVIS: Shit.

03:04:05.666 --> 03:04:12.120
LIAM: Tell you what: after the coast, we will
propose it to the group. If they don't want to go,

03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:13.628
I will go with you.

03:04:13.628 --> 03:04:19.157
SAM: All right. You're more powerful now, aren't
you? I saw you got a bunch of paper.

03:04:19.157 --> 03:04:21.550
TRAVIS: Got that paper!

03:04:21.550 --> 03:04:26.029
LIAM: Eh. I don't know.

03:04:26.029 --> 03:04:29.904
SAM: Well, you've been doing new spells and
things. It's pretty--

03:04:29.904 --> 03:04:32.572
LIAM: Go ahead.

03:04:32.572 --> 03:04:44.945
SAM: No, it's pretty incredible. Have you been
able to do anything that you've wanted to-- Been

03:04:44.945 --> 03:04:48.290
studying? Like some special, spectacular spells
that can--

03:04:48.290 --> 03:04:55.143
LIAM: I mean, I've expanded my repertoire. I have
a few new tricks that I will hold onto for the

03:04:55.143 --> 03:04:59.709
right moment. Are you okay?

03:04:59.709 --> 03:05:04.273
SAM: I think so! I think I'm okay.

03:05:04.273 --> 03:05:07.663
LIAM: Okay. You seem a little restless to me.

03:05:07.663 --> 03:05:20.395
SAM: Ever since Molly fell, I've just been--
there's a bit of a sense of urgency, you know? We

03:05:20.395 --> 03:05:27.557
have things that we need to do and we don't have
forever to do them. I want to keep you on your

03:05:27.557 --> 03:05:31.779
path and I want to keep on my path as well.

03:05:31.779 --> 03:05:39.250
LIAM: I'm working on mine. Mine is a little
long-goal, perhaps.

03:05:39.250 --> 03:05:44.454
SAM: What is it you're working on? Just learning
new magic?

03:05:44.454 --> 03:05:53.563
LIAM: You know what I've done.

03:05:53.563 --> 03:05:59.135
SAM: I know, but I don't know how you're going to
undo it.

03:05:59.135 --> 03:06:14.498
LIAM: Well, I don't have one plan in mind. Part of
me thinks that I should just stop it from happening to

03:06:14.498 --> 03:06:30.051
anyone else. Part of me is very selfish and wants
to carve it out of my past.

03:06:30.051 --> 03:06:35.582
SAM: That's not selfish, that's important.

03:06:35.582 --> 03:06:39.844
LIAM: It's dangerous, not just to me.

03:06:39.844 --> 03:06:51.190
SAM: Oh. Well, I think I understand a little about
that, too. There's things that I want to change as

03:06:51.190 --> 03:07:04.353
well. Things that would be risky to change. But
sometimes you have to take a big risk, if it's

03:07:04.353 --> 03:07:06.242
that important.

03:07:06.242 --> 03:07:17.418
LIAM: That is true. You are my greatest friend.

03:07:17.418 --> 03:07:22.952
SAM: Little ol' me?

03:07:22.952 --> 03:07:33.343
LIAM: I like you because you are funny, but it's
more than that. We will get you what you want.

03:07:33.343 --> 03:07:39.519
Even if there is some risk. Because if it's really
important, it's worth the risk, <i>ja</i>?

03:07:39.519 --> 03:07:43.422
SAM: Yes.

03:07:43.422 --> 03:07:48.651
LIAM: Okay. You and I, we have an agreement. A
pact.

03:07:48.651 --> 03:07:52.189
SAM: Yes.

03:07:52.189 --> 03:07:59.751
LIAM: Whatever you need, we are going to make it
happen.

03:07:59.751 --> 03:08:09.343
SAM: Even if it's risky, yes. We're going to do
it. You'll help me?

03:08:09.343 --> 03:08:11.447
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:08:11.447 --> 03:08:13.769
SAM: No matter what?

03:08:13.769 --> 03:08:17.574
LIAM: If it is in my power, I will do it.

03:08:17.574 --> 03:08:23.326
SAM: Good. Well then, onward to the beach!

03:08:23.326 --> 03:08:29.578
LIAM: That's funny. I've never been to the beach.

03:08:29.578 --> 03:08:37.758
SAM: Oh! I bet you would sunburn easily. You
should probably coat yourself with a layer of

03:08:37.758 --> 03:08:39.763
dirt, just to make sure.

03:08:39.763 --> 03:08:41.101
LIAM: Done and done.

03:08:41.101 --> 03:08:46.227
TALIESIN: Were you just thinking about that? Don't
think I wasn't.

03:08:46.227 --> 03:08:50.315
LAURA: I'm sorry. I'll buy you another one.

03:08:50.315 --> 03:08:51.550
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you are.

03:08:51.550 --> 03:08:55.783
MATT: As you've reconvened, are there any last
materials you need to pick up for the journey, or

03:08:55.783 --> 03:08:57.034
are you ready to move?

03:08:57.034 --> 03:09:00.885
LAURA: I'm going to buy Cad a hat. A straw hat, to
replace the one I stole from him.

03:09:00.885 --> 03:09:04.121
MATT: Okay. Caduceus' hat replaced.

03:09:04.121 --> 03:09:11.202
TALIESIN: I'm also going to distribute-- I made
everybody a potion of healing, so everybody gets--

03:09:11.202 --> 03:09:12.694
SAM: You made that?!

03:09:12.694 --> 03:09:15.386
TALIESIN: I made them myself. They've got a
bit of a weird flavor, but they're--

03:09:15.429 --> 03:09:18.301
LIAM: The Cad in the Hat delivers.

03:09:18.301 --> 03:09:19.404
TALIESIN: They're great.

03:09:19.404 --> 03:09:20.753
TRAVIS: What level are they?

03:09:20.753 --> 03:09:21.830
MATT: Basic: level one.

03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:23.988
MARISHA: But still.

03:09:23.988 --> 03:09:25.233
MATT: Caduceus can now--

03:09:25.233 --> 03:09:26.533
MARISHA: You basic!

03:09:26.533 --> 03:09:34.734
MATT: Caduceus can make one healing potion for 25
gold and one day of downtime.

03:09:34.734 --> 03:09:36.565
LAURA: Whoa!

03:09:36.565 --> 03:09:40.950
TALIESIN: It's a nice little pick-me-up if anyone
goes down next to you.

03:09:40.950 --> 03:09:45.111
MARISHA: You know, I had that as Keyleth at later
levels; I never fucking used it.

03:09:45.111 --> 03:09:47.571
LAURA: Wow, thanks Keyleth.

03:09:47.571 --> 03:09:49.451
LAURA and TALIESIN: #ThanksKeyleth

03:09:49.451 --> 03:09:51.327
MATT: She had better options by then.

03:09:51.327 --> 03:09:52.440
TALIESIN: Kiki had other things going on.

03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:53.665
MARISHA: We got super busy.

03:09:53.665 --> 03:09:56.127
LIAM: We could go anywhere on the planet at any
time.

03:09:56.127 --> 03:09:57.947
MATT: Yeah, don't miss those days.

03:09:57.947 --> 03:10:00.205
MARISHA: It's a bad thing to have at later levels;
it was better at lower levels.

03:10:00.205 --> 03:10:01.841
TRAVIS: Boosh!

03:10:01.841 --> 03:10:05.493
MATT: It's like, "Oh, you can teleport anywhere?
Cool, let me just prepare the world every week."

03:10:05.493 --> 03:10:08.514
Don't miss that at all.

03:10:08.514 --> 03:10:11.483
LIAM: Matt, we want to go to Brazil-- No, Norway.

03:10:11.483 --> 03:10:15.542
MATT: All right. Goddamn it, Sam.

03:10:15.542 --> 03:10:16.810
SAM: Oh. Sorry.

03:10:16.810 --> 03:10:25.665
MATT: You gather your supplies, finish your
business here for the time being. You gather up

03:10:25.665 --> 03:10:30.964
your new cart that you brought down from
Shadycreek Run.

03:10:30.964 --> 03:10:32.231
TRAVIS: Hey! Invisi-cart.

03:10:32.231 --> 03:10:33.427
MARISHA: Invisi-cart.

03:10:33.427 --> 03:10:37.186
MATT: And your horses, which are two that pull the
cart, and you have--

03:10:37.186 --> 03:10:38.955
LAURA: Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia.

03:10:38.955 --> 03:10:41.413
MATT: Correct, you have your two horses and the
cart.

03:10:41.413 --> 03:10:45.917
SAM: Do we need more for the journey, or is that
enough?

03:10:45.917 --> 03:10:47.415
MARISHA: Didn't we have a couple more, too?

03:10:47.415 --> 03:10:50.830
SAM: No, we set them free.

03:10:50.830 --> 03:10:52.072
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

03:10:52.072 --> 03:10:56.474
MATT: That's enough. So your two horses and your
cart. You leave the southern gates of Zadash,

03:10:56.474 --> 03:11:03.587
making your way southward, retracing your steps
down through Alfield and Trostenwald, to

03:11:03.587 --> 03:11:08.808
eventually make your way through the Wuyun Gorge,
the Wuyun Gates, where you two first began this

03:11:08.808 --> 03:11:15.248
journey in session zero, and southward to the
Menagerie Coast beyond. And that's where we'll

03:11:15.248 --> 03:11:20.035
finish tonight's episode, we'll pick up with that
next week. This is going to be a whole different

03:11:20.035 --> 03:11:21.293
flavor, I'm excited.

03:11:21.293 --> 03:11:22.693
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

03:11:22.693 --> 03:11:29.381
MATT: Well, shit. All right! We'll pick up for
that next week. As a reminder, the week after

03:11:29.381 --> 03:11:35.315
that, Marisha, myself, and Taliesin will be out in
the thing in the desert.

03:11:35.315 --> 03:11:37.104
TALIESIN: Unavailable, yeah.

03:11:37.104 --> 03:11:38.085
MATT: Unavailable.

03:11:38.085 --> 03:11:39.115
MARISHA: Indisposed!

03:11:39.115 --> 03:11:42.714
MATT: Indisposed. However, that doesn't mean that
we're going dark. There will be a special one-shot

03:11:42.714 --> 03:11:49.954
happening that week. The last Thursday of August.
More details to come as far as that's concerned.

03:11:49.954 --> 03:11:55.502
Just preparing you guys for that. There will be a
week off from the main story. We'll be back next

03:11:55.549 --> 03:12:00.658
week to see this next leg of the journey and see
where it takes us. In the interim, thank you

03:12:00.658 --> 03:12:04.254
again, D&amp;D Beyond. Thank you guys for coming along
with us.

03:12:04.254 --> 03:12:06.376
SAM: (singing) D&amp;D Beyond!

03:12:06.376 --> 03:12:07.961
MATT: No. We're done.

03:12:07.961 --> 03:12:10.083
SAM: (singing) Make love to me tonight.

03:12:10.083 --> 03:12:16.837
MATT: Anyway, have a wonderful night, guys. Thanks
for coming along with us. We love you, and is it

03:12:16.837 --> 03:12:20.001
Thursday yet? Good night.

03:12:20.001 --> 03:26:47.335

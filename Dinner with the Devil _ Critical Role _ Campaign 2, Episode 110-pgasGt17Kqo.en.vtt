00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:01.897
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

00:00:01.897 --> 00:00:04.000
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.029
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.751
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:11.029
MATT: It's a lot of syllables in that one.

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:12.145
But before we get into that, we do have

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.247
some quick announcements to get through,

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:16.472
beginning with the first of our two sponsors.

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:19.501
The first is the wonderful NordVPN.

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:23.392
So let's turn over to our resident hackers, Sam and Laura.

00:00:23.392 --> 00:00:25.514
SAM: Okay. Okay, KryptonicOverride.

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:27.688
Now that Taliesin freed us from the internet,

00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:29.586
and with NordVPN encrypting our traffic

00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:31.728
and hiding our IP and physical location,

00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:35.767
we can unlock the secret of the evil Ultra Codex.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.659
LAURA: This'll be a walk in the park, blackwillow69.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.369
Time to ja-- ja...

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:43.619
TALIESIN: Jack in?

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:47.858
LAURA: Jack in, yes, to the main-- main something.

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:49.450
TALIESIN: Frame.
LAURA: Frame!

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.928
LAURA: Positronic. Obviously.

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:54.112
Time to jack into the mainframe.
SAM: Yeah, let's do it!

00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:55.695
Okay, here we go.

00:00:56.843 --> 00:00:58.038
Oh, a firewall.

00:00:58.038 --> 00:00:59.872
Oh, dang. I--

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:01.591
I have no idea what to do.

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:03.412
I'm stuck.

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:07.163
LAURA: Oh, BlackWillow, I got a cube over here?

00:01:07.163 --> 00:01:08.986
Guess I'm going to have to beam it?

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.552
I don't know, do you beam a cube? I don't--

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:15.217
SAM: No, no, I think you dream it, or meme it?

00:01:15.217 --> 00:01:16.417
I can't remember.

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:18.694
LAURA: Oh no, no, no, it's asking for a password!

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:20.300
SAM: Password? No problem.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.393
Wait, actually, we should probably respect their privacy

00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:24.249
and just stop right there.
TRAVIS: Whoa.

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.542
TALIESIN: Oh my GameCube.

00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:28.063
You've lost your powers!

00:01:28.063 --> 00:01:30.335
SAM: Wait, what?

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:32.345
TALIESIN: When you were in the web, the Serial Killer

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:35.119
must have drained your haxxor abilities!

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.120
Your minds have been sliced!

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.782
SAM: But we're the most sophisticated key punchers

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:41.751
the dark net has ever booted!

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.811
There isn't a digital Kenan that we can't Kel!

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:45.991
TALIESIN: There's no doubt that--

00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.357
ASHLEY: Wow.
(laughter)

00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:50.047
TALIESIN: You are the greatest crypto kings

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:51.798
to ever keylog a target.

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:53.060
But without your hacking skills,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.681
you'll never beat the Ultra Codex.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.163
LAURA: What do we do, FreezerBurn?

00:01:58.163 --> 00:02:01.049
TALIESIN: There is a way, but it's dangerous.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.888
I could download my entire 1.21 gigaflops

00:02:03.888 --> 00:02:06.903
of brain archives into your Flashdance protocol.

00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:08.864
SAM: Wait a second, a data transfer?

00:02:08.864 --> 00:02:10.959
But you'd be giving up your master level

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.343
computer powers, forever!

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:16.015
TALIESIN: It's the only way.

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:19.178
One last hack, for justice!

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:22.849
SAM, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Haxxors, click together.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:23.729
SAM: Okay.

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.412
(laughter)

00:02:27.412 --> 00:02:30.336
(laughter)

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:31.881
MATT: Oh no!

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:34.341
TALIESIN: We're only going to have one shot.

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:35.174
SAM: You okay over there?

00:02:35.174 --> 00:02:36.065
TALIESIN: I'll be fine.

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:39.259
(laughter)

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.220
TALIESIN: Power glove is overcranked.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.198
Transfer modules, hot and bothered. Master and commander?

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:46.963
SAM: The far side of the world.

00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:49.036
LAURA: Far side of the world!

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:51.058
TALIESIN: Farewell, hacker planet.

00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:52.958
It was leet while it lasted.

00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.925
Activating self-slice!

00:02:55.925 --> 00:03:00.825
SAM, LAURA, and TALIESIN: (screaming)

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:05.641
LAURA: Did it work?

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:08.323
SAM: Zero one zero one one zero zero one.

00:03:08.323 --> 00:03:09.156
LAURA: (gasps)

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:11.050
That's binary for yes.
SAM: Yeah!

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.718
LAURA: I know binary!
SAM: Yeah!

00:03:12.718 --> 00:03:15.168
LAURA: FreezerBurn, are you okay?

00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:17.911
TALIESIN: Oh. Oh, who?

00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:19.011
Oh jeez.

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:22.211
Those are some pretty doohickeys you got there.

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:24.824
Are those calculators on your arm or something?

00:03:24.824 --> 00:03:26.485
LAURA: Holy shift.

00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:27.451
He's gone.

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:30.936
FreezerBurn's sacrifice will not be in vain.

00:03:30.936 --> 00:03:31.769
SAM: No.

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.765
LAURA: Because we're going to heck--
SAM and LAURA: -- the Ultra Codex.

00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:38.385
SAM: Yeah, and with NordVPN's 68% off sale going on,

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.735
it'll only cost us $3.71 a month,

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:42.750
plus we get an additional month free

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.690
when we sign up at nordvpn.com/criticalrole

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.713
and use coupon code criticalrole.

00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:49.969
NordVPN's secure and unlimited service

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.126
will literally save the world.

00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:52.959
LAURA: Yeah.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.080
SAM and LAURA: Matt, hack to you.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.049
MATT: (sighs)

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.049
(laughter)

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:07.505
MATT: Tune in next time for another techno-tastic episode

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:10.302
of the Nord in the Stone.

00:04:10.302 --> 00:04:11.382
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:04:11.382 --> 00:04:14.227
MATT: If NordVPN never sponsors us again.

00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:15.765
LIAM: That was a dramatic reading.

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:16.725
MATT: (laughs)

00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:17.738
ASHLEY: That was very dramatic.

00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:20.058
MATT: Wow, yeah, that took some turns.

00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:21.525
ASHLEY: The prop work was great.

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:22.427
SAM: Thank you.

00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:23.589
MATT: Well done.

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:24.766
SAM: Thank you, Maxwell.

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.144
MATT: Thank you, Sam and Laura and Taliesin,

00:04:27.144 --> 00:04:29.679
and Nord VPN for your patience.

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:30.554
And our--

00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:32.034
MARISHA: Did you shake it to turn it off?

00:04:32.034 --> 00:04:33.750
That was incredible!

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.090
MATT: (laughs)

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.048
MARISHA: Oh my god.

00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:38.274
MATT: That's how I turn off all my electronics.

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:40.210
That's how I turn off my PS4.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.300
LAURA: Might leave my haxxor
gear on the table for the game,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.935
because it's awesome.
MATT: It's pretty cool.

00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:45.006
TALIESIN: That looks like a lot of fun.

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:46.526
SAM: That won't distract us at all.

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:49.113
(laughter)

00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:50.762

MATT: And welcome back.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:49.204
So last we left off: The Mighty Nein,

00:08:49.204 --> 00:08:51.691
after returning from Traveler Con

00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:52.821
and their adventures at Rumblecusp,

00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:56.053
made their way to Nicodranas to catch up a bit

00:08:56.053 --> 00:08:58.703
with Marion Lavorre.
LAURA: Yeah!

00:08:58.703 --> 00:09:01.862
MATT: To do some shopping, to set off some research

00:09:01.862 --> 00:09:03.675
into some aspects of the mysteries

00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:06.872
that surround some of their recent adventures,

00:09:06.872 --> 00:09:09.386
and we--

00:09:09.386 --> 00:09:11.302
I guess introduced-- not introduced--

00:09:11.302 --> 00:09:13.576
returned Nott to spend some time

00:09:13.576 --> 00:09:16.968
with her family. Veth, with her family.

00:09:18.489 --> 00:09:20.156
During that period of time, you all decided

00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:21.629
to make your way to Rexxentrum,

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:25.873
to speak with Lady Vess DeRogna,

00:09:25.873 --> 00:09:28.233
one of the members of the Cerberus Assembly,

00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:31.151
who had previously said that they were interested

00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:35.165
in some transactions, or a business opportunity for you,

00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:38.102
after seeing what you had achieved

00:09:38.102 --> 00:09:40.964
in the name of the negotiation that ended

00:09:40.964 --> 00:09:45.797
the current war between Xhorhas and the Dwendalian Empire.

00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:49.786
After doing a little shopping around Rexxentrum

00:09:49.786 --> 00:09:54.344
and gathering some extremely powerful magical artifacts,

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:58.833
you made your way to the DeRogna's tower,

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:03.480
had a conversation that outlined the future interest she had

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.422
to the north, in a location known as Eiselcross.

00:10:08.322 --> 00:10:12.412
She let you know about an element of a shadow war

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:14.526
that had been long brewing in that direction

00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:18.352
and a race to power between many factions,

00:10:18.352 --> 00:10:22.774
namely the Empire and the Dynasty, in search of these ruins

00:10:22.774 --> 00:10:26.226
that had begun to uncovered in recent times

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:27.559
beneath the ice.

00:10:28.507 --> 00:10:30.407
Broken bits of the

00:10:30.407 --> 00:10:35.290
ancient arcane city of Aeor seem to have been

00:10:36.373 --> 00:10:39.494
slowly recovered from beneath that region,

00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:42.212
and she would wish you to accompany her there

00:10:42.212 --> 00:10:44.865
in search of more information and answers

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:47.920
as to what it's capable of, what can be found,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.942
and preventing others that she feels

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.988
should not have such power within their midst.

00:10:53.988 --> 00:10:57.786
So you accepted this and were given about a week or so

00:10:57.786 --> 00:10:59.742
to return when you finished your preparations

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.109
to begin your journey to this odd,

00:11:03.109 --> 00:11:06.763
much colder region of Wildemount.

00:11:06.763 --> 00:11:10.274
Upon exiting the tower in Rexxentrum,

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:12.813
not too terribly long after your arrival,

00:11:12.813 --> 00:11:14.760
a message was delivered to the group,

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.415
a letter that was addressed to Bren.

00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:20.157
Upon reading the letter, it seems that your presence

00:11:20.157 --> 00:11:24.032
was also noted by Master Trent Ikithon,

00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:28.716
who then requested the presence of you, Caleb,

00:11:28.716 --> 00:11:33.296
and your companions, the evening of the next day,

00:11:33.296 --> 00:11:36.185
to join in his tower, along with

00:11:36.185 --> 00:11:40.385
your two previous classmates, Astrid and Eadwulf.

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:43.327
And that was where we had left off.

00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:46.652
So as you all stand around Caleb

00:11:46.652 --> 00:11:49.460
in the midday, cloudy air,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.119
on the not terribly bustling streets

00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:55.327
of the Candles region of Rexxentrum,

00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:58.101
as Caleb finishes reading this letter out loud

00:11:58.101 --> 00:11:59.125
to the rest of you,

00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:02.434
what do you do?

00:12:06.662 --> 00:12:07.820
LAURA: Are you going to go?

00:12:13.393 --> 00:12:14.918
LIAM: (sighs)

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:16.959
<i>Ja</i>.

00:12:20.232 --> 00:12:22.982
<i>Ja</i>, it's what we came back for.

00:12:25.843 --> 00:12:30.776
There's a lot I don't understand still.

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:34.342
And...

00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:39.475
my old teacher...

00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:43.045
is...

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:48.768
LAURA: A douche?

00:12:51.256 --> 00:12:55.089
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but I don't know how

00:12:57.192 --> 00:13:01.326
redeemable or not my friends are.

00:13:03.684 --> 00:13:06.625
I don't have a lot of faith that they are, but...

00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:12.953
I need to know.

00:13:14.975 --> 00:13:15.925
For sure.

00:13:18.752 --> 00:13:21.560
And then also, I have many questions about the Assembly.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.585
It is hard to know if they have--

00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:28.720
if their plans line up with the king's

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.595
or if they have their own plans.

00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:34.606
If they have the same plan within the Assembly.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.814
They don't all seem to get along.

00:13:39.243 --> 00:13:41.429
LAURA: You don't think it's a trap, do you?

00:13:41.429 --> 00:13:44.679
LIAM: I think it very well could be a trap.

00:13:45.713 --> 00:13:48.388
TRAVIS: What do you think he wants from this meeting,

00:13:48.388 --> 00:13:49.304
from you?

00:13:58.096 --> 00:13:59.874
LIAM: That's a very good question and I'm not sure

00:13:59.874 --> 00:14:02.791
I can give you a definitive answer.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:04.723
But...

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:09.492
Trent took his work very personally.

00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:12.874
My best guess is

00:14:14.948 --> 00:14:18.051
I am somewhat of a failed experiment.

00:14:18.051 --> 00:14:18.884
TRAVIS: Hmm.

00:14:23.682 --> 00:14:24.515
LIAM: I don't know.

00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:27.579
I don't know why I was left abandoned for so long.

00:14:31.727 --> 00:14:32.860
I'm curious.

00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:38.668
MARISHA: What if you aren't a failed experiment?

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:44.749
LIAM: You think there's another shoe going to drop?

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:46.243
MARISHA: Maybe.

00:14:46.243 --> 00:14:48.002
LAURA: Like they let him go on purpose?

00:14:51.511 --> 00:14:53.294
TRAVIS: We've certainly achieved more than

00:14:55.002 --> 00:14:56.030
he had previously.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.497
Perhaps he's just in favor now?

00:15:00.204 --> 00:15:01.654
LIAM: I've considered it.

00:15:03.746 --> 00:15:05.968
MARISHA: Just trying to think of all the angles.

00:15:07.743 --> 00:15:09.576
LIAM: Regardless, Beauregard--

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:12.409
LAURA: I think it's "irregardless."

00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:13.720
TRAVIS: Irregardless?

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.797
TALIESIN: Unregardless.

00:15:14.797 --> 00:15:16.499
LAURA: Unregardless, that was it.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.973
LIAM: Zemnian is very precise.

00:15:17.973 --> 00:15:20.585
MARISHA: They did just update that in the Cobalt Reserve

00:15:20.585 --> 00:15:22.301
dictionary.
LAURA: No, no!

00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:24.186
TRAVIS: They did fucking update it, actually.

00:15:24.186 --> 00:15:25.215
LAURA: No.

00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:26.576
TRAVIS: Just maddening.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:26.576 --> 00:15:28.232
LIAM: It's decay of the Empire.

00:15:28.232 --> 00:15:30.482
TRAVIS: Death by a thousand cuts.

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:35.719
LIAM: It could be a trap, though.

00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:39.110
And I need to impress upon you.

00:15:40.413 --> 00:15:44.468
Ikithon is about as dangerous an individual

00:15:44.468 --> 00:15:46.949
as you will encounter in your lives,

00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:49.032
and Eadwulf and Astrid...

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.662
are likely not too far behind,

00:15:57.662 --> 00:15:59.112
or maybe they--

00:15:59.112 --> 00:16:01.536
LAURA: They can't be as powerful as you are.

00:16:04.227 --> 00:16:06.448
LIAM: They have a bit of a head start on me, Jester.

00:16:06.448 --> 00:16:07.281
LAURA: How?

00:16:08.792 --> 00:16:09.936
Were they there longer?
MARISHA: They didn't drop out.

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:10.769
LAURA: What?

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.015
MARISHA: They didn't drop out.

00:16:12.015 --> 00:16:13.673
LAURA: Yeah, but

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.519
you use so many spells, you're so powerful,

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:20.619
and you've been learning from lots of different sources.

00:16:20.619 --> 00:16:22.969
They only had the one source.

00:16:24.707 --> 00:16:27.957
LIAM: Well, they didn't take a nap for a decade.

00:16:30.953 --> 00:16:31.786
But--

00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:36.416
Just be ready for anything.

00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:41.595
He is powerful, Ikithon, but they--

00:16:41.595 --> 00:16:44.281
I can only guess at some of the things they have done

00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:47.820
since I knew them, but there is much that I do know.

00:16:48.728 --> 00:16:52.240
And they made the ultimate sacrifice for country.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.649
LAURA: How old were you when you were here?

00:16:58.147 --> 00:17:00.210
LIAM: I was a young man; I was 16.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.593
LAURA: 16?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:17:06.536 --> 00:17:09.719
ASHLEY: Wait, you slept for 10 years?

00:17:09.719 --> 00:17:12.025
Or is this just like a figure of speech?

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.734
MARISHA: Rip van Widogast.

00:17:17.215 --> 00:17:21.015
LIAM: I was not in my right mind

00:17:21.015 --> 00:17:23.240
for a long time.

00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:25.718
ASHLEY: I understand.

00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:29.067
LAURA: So you weren't actually sleeping.

00:17:31.957 --> 00:17:33.228
Were you sleeping?

00:17:33.228 --> 00:17:34.493
LIAM: No.

00:17:34.493 --> 00:17:35.796
Technically no.

00:17:35.796 --> 00:17:37.562
LAURA: Okay, because I-- okay.

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:40.900
ASHLEY: Was someone else

00:17:42.808 --> 00:17:44.941
controlling you?

00:17:44.941 --> 00:17:46.801
LIAM: At that time?
ASHLEY: At that time?

00:17:46.801 --> 00:17:48.718
LIAM: No, not at that time.

00:17:52.203 --> 00:17:56.445
There are some gaps for some of you.

00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:01.040
Could we go somewhere

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.365
a little more private than the street?

00:18:04.448 --> 00:18:07.048
LAURA: Yeah. Let's go.
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:10.507
LIAM: Okay.

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:13.090
I would like to try to navigate our way

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.565
to some sort of an inn.

00:18:16.683 --> 00:18:18.123
MATT: Okay, yeah.

00:18:18.123 --> 00:18:20.739
LAURA: (laughs) You're still not here!

00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:23.365
(laughs) Okay, okay, okay.

00:18:23.365 --> 00:18:25.285
It's still the same day, right?

00:18:25.285 --> 00:18:27.446
It's still the same day that we left Veth?

00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:28.537
MATT: Since the morning, yes.

00:18:28.537 --> 00:18:30.725
LAURA: Okay, so we're calling you tomorrow.

00:18:30.725 --> 00:18:32.125
SAM: Take your time.
LAURA: Okay.

00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:35.211
TRAVIS: Nice place. Just keep chilling.
SAM: I'm doing fine.

00:18:35.211 --> 00:18:37.755
ASHLEY: Wait, no, aren't you coming here this morning?

00:18:37.755 --> 00:18:39.571
MATT: Hmm.

00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:42.153
Are you looking for an inn here in the Shimmer Ward,

00:18:42.153 --> 00:18:43.843
or are you looking for something a little more--?

00:18:43.843 --> 00:18:45.621
LIAM: Something very rudimentary.

00:18:45.621 --> 00:18:47.242
MATT: Okay. Yeah, easy enough.

00:18:47.242 --> 00:18:48.317
Back to the...

00:18:49.952 --> 00:18:51.677
Not too far from where you

00:18:51.677 --> 00:18:55.585
first arrived at the Rexxentrum Archive

00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:57.245
of the Cobalt Soul,

00:18:57.245 --> 00:19:00.853
you find a small corner

00:19:00.853 --> 00:19:04.827
of two dingy roads inn that maybe can house--

00:19:05.858 --> 00:19:07.993
has about six rooms for rent.

00:19:07.993 --> 00:19:11.561
It can house a handful of people per chamber.

00:19:11.561 --> 00:19:12.518
LIAM: Okay.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:16.594
MATT: But it's really inexpensive, I'd say for--

00:19:16.594 --> 00:19:17.752
It's about a....

00:19:19.234 --> 00:19:21.984
two silver pieces to rent a room.

00:19:23.469 --> 00:19:28.000
LIAM: I will rent it just to be perfunctory and find--

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.771
and there eating down below?

00:19:30.613 --> 00:19:34.364
MATT: This isn't so much a lunch tavern, more than just--

00:19:34.364 --> 00:19:36.330
LIAM: A place to stay.
MATT: -- a place to stay.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.738
They do have snacks.

00:19:37.738 --> 00:19:38.917
LIAM: Nah. It will do.

00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:40.810
I will lead everyone up to the room.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.014
MATT: Okay.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.398
LIAM: That I've rented.

00:19:43.398 --> 00:19:45.743
LAURA: This place is nice, Caleb.

00:19:45.743 --> 00:19:47.867
LIAM: We're only going to stay for a moment.

00:19:47.867 --> 00:19:49.534
I'm not comfortable--

00:19:52.723 --> 00:19:54.240
There are gaps.

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:04.240
Astrid and Eadwulf were willing to do

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.381
anything that...

00:20:07.507 --> 00:20:09.065
Ikithon asked of them.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.138
And their final test was to kill their own flesh and blood.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.338
And they did so.

00:20:21.197 --> 00:20:23.122
And I am like them.

00:20:25.863 --> 00:20:26.696
W--was...

00:20:31.007 --> 00:20:32.673
Am. Am like them.

00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:36.205
MARISHA: Was.

00:20:36.205 --> 00:20:38.079
TALIESIN: We share a road with a lot of people.

00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:41.417
That doesn't mean that they're all the same,

00:20:41.417 --> 00:20:44.584
especially when you take a crossroads.

00:20:45.885 --> 00:20:48.143
LAURA: So you-- you did it?

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.063
LIAM: I-I-I have considered...

00:21:00.902 --> 00:21:04.568
sharing all this for a long time, but...

00:21:06.572 --> 00:21:10.364
you cherish your family so much.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:13.938
And...

00:21:17.898 --> 00:21:20.156
I suppose I enjoyed

00:21:21.723 --> 00:21:25.748
being seen as I should have been.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.733
Or-- or could have been.

00:21:31.427 --> 00:21:33.893
LAURA: I just go up and give him a hug.

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:42.170
LIAM: There is a reason I have never told you

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.420
about my mother and father.

00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:48.341
LAURA: You must've been so sad, Caleb.

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:53.312
I'm sorry you felt like you had to hide that.

00:21:58.146 --> 00:22:01.662
LIAM: (inhales sharply) Well, I've been lying to you.

00:22:06.737 --> 00:22:07.987
And I am sorry.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.689
LAURA: We lie.

00:22:11.689 --> 00:22:15.181
We lie about things all the time to protect other people.

00:22:17.228 --> 00:22:19.569
Sometimes to protect ourselves.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.762
I don't blame you for that.

00:22:34.577 --> 00:22:37.327
LIAM: Whatever we're doing here, I...

00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:44.168
I've come home in the hopes of atoning.

00:22:46.412 --> 00:22:47.245
And...

00:22:49.375 --> 00:22:51.875
That idea has evolved

00:22:53.158 --> 00:22:54.849
quite a bit over time.

00:22:57.142 --> 00:23:00.175
And I'm not sure what the exact answer is,

00:23:02.953 --> 00:23:04.620
but I mean to atone.

00:23:09.748 --> 00:23:12.564
ASHLEY: What does atonement look like to you, Caleb?

00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:24.449
LIAM: Well, I feel like

00:23:27.274 --> 00:23:29.683
the things that I've seen, no one should see.

00:23:37.038 --> 00:23:38.812
Never again.

00:23:38.812 --> 00:23:42.686
LAURA: So we should put a stop to it, then.

00:23:42.686 --> 00:23:45.175
LIAM: Well, it's complicated, isn't it?

00:23:46.609 --> 00:23:50.109
It's wrapped up in the ruling of a nation.

00:23:53.196 --> 00:23:56.446
MARISHA: You've come a long way since me, you,

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.514
and Nott were huddled up in that hotel room.

00:24:05.537 --> 00:24:07.588
I said then you had a responsibility

00:24:07.588 --> 00:24:11.163
and that none of us would see you differently.

00:24:16.518 --> 00:24:18.904
TALIESIN: No one should be put through that.
ASHLEY: (quietly) No.

00:24:19.929 --> 00:24:22.226
MARISHA: No one blames you.

00:24:22.226 --> 00:24:23.059
LIAM: Well.

00:24:24.158 --> 00:24:25.258
One person.

00:24:28.976 --> 00:24:33.493
Anyway, I find it hard to imagine

00:24:33.493 --> 00:24:36.184
walking in there tomorrow and

00:24:37.151 --> 00:24:39.535
you not knowing the whole picture.

00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:45.740
(quietly) That's the whole picture.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:59.130
I want to learn a little bit what's going on

00:25:00.287 --> 00:25:02.562
in my colleagues' heads.

00:25:03.807 --> 00:25:05.694
MARISHA: We saw them.

00:25:05.694 --> 00:25:06.844
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:25:08.342 --> 00:25:09.869
MARISHA: We were handing off the beacon.

00:25:09.869 --> 00:25:11.036
They didn't...

00:25:13.035 --> 00:25:15.368
They looked pretty far gone.

00:25:20.314 --> 00:25:22.795
LIAM: I have to try.

00:25:22.795 --> 00:25:25.387
MARISHA: Think there's something redeemable?

00:25:25.387 --> 00:25:27.129
Think they're worth saving?

00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:31.765
LIAM: They're worth saving, yeah.

00:25:31.765 --> 00:25:34.348
Whether or not we can, I don't know.

00:25:35.553 --> 00:25:39.570
TRAVIS: Did they ever waiver, or have they remained

00:25:40.784 --> 00:25:43.034
believers this entire time?

00:25:46.331 --> 00:25:49.614
LIAM: Well, as children,

00:25:49.614 --> 00:25:50.447
no.

00:25:51.889 --> 00:25:53.097
Not to my recollection.

00:25:53.097 --> 00:25:56.589
We were very avid in our duties.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.170
LAURA: So you never wavered either.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.663
LIAM: No.

00:26:08.992 --> 00:26:10.575
LAURA: And it was the...

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.720
the final act that made you change your beliefs?

00:26:31.874 --> 00:26:35.857
LIAM: So much time was put into
stamping me into a specific shape.

00:26:37.859 --> 00:26:41.767
It was comforting to know your place...

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400
and serve...

00:26:51.117 --> 00:26:52.534
the greater good.

00:26:56.257 --> 00:26:57.565
But, uh...

00:27:00.515 --> 00:27:02.798
I-- I failed my people.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.297
<i>My</i> people.

00:27:08.208 --> 00:27:09.822
TALIESIN: Feel like they failed you.

00:27:09.822 --> 00:27:12.652
LAURA: Yeah, your family sent you off to the Academy,

00:27:12.652 --> 00:27:13.652
didn't they?

00:27:15.077 --> 00:27:18.327
They believed those same things, right?

00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:21.257
LIAM: To a degree.

00:27:23.766 --> 00:27:28.765
Yes, my parents were very big
believers in the Empire, but...

00:27:31.307 --> 00:27:32.482
they also...

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.181
loved me.

00:27:37.354 --> 00:27:42.096
As wholly as your family, Caduceus, or yours.

00:27:45.325 --> 00:27:47.798
MARISHA: It's not a failure on your part.

00:27:47.798 --> 00:27:49.973
It's a failure on the Empire's.

00:27:53.314 --> 00:27:56.897
I don't think that it's by coincidence that

00:27:59.024 --> 00:28:02.856
your core beliefs that you were doing something

00:28:02.856 --> 00:28:04.539
for the greater good...

00:28:06.622 --> 00:28:09.697
led you to us and what we're doing now.

00:28:12.653 --> 00:28:14.070
<i>That's</i> the truth.

00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:21.744
LIAM: Well, it remains to be seen what we can do,

00:28:21.744 --> 00:28:23.686
but maybe we can do.

00:28:26.704 --> 00:28:28.784
MARISHA: Had this conversation with Fjord of the other night

00:28:28.784 --> 00:28:31.752
when we were still in Rumblecusp.

00:28:31.752 --> 00:28:33.669
Think we're doing good?

00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:39.584
What we're doing as a group?

00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:42.741
LIAM: I do.

00:28:47.171 --> 00:28:50.632
MARISHA: I mean, that's pretty dope, right?

00:28:50.632 --> 00:28:53.015
LIAM: Yeah, the Mighty Nein is...

00:28:53.015 --> 00:28:54.523
is pretty dope.

00:28:54.523 --> 00:28:57.308
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh)

00:28:57.308 --> 00:28:58.433
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

00:29:01.616 --> 00:29:04.666
LIAM: The stage is a little bit bigger.

00:29:06.267 --> 00:29:07.934
ASHLEY: I have a question.

00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:11.997
Did they do this with every student at the Academy,

00:29:11.997 --> 00:29:14.897
or were you just a select few that was...

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:18.376
chosen?

00:29:18.376 --> 00:29:21.276
LIAM: Trent has an eye for talent.

00:29:23.784 --> 00:29:28.175
And to my understanding, we were just the latest.

00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:32.629
We were not the first and we were not to be the last.

00:29:34.062 --> 00:29:36.895
TRAVIS: You three were a bit of a class?

00:29:38.923 --> 00:29:39.756
LIAM: Yeah.

00:29:42.355 --> 00:29:44.704
Boy, I have thought a lot about this for a long time

00:29:44.704 --> 00:29:47.515
and talked to no one about it.

00:29:47.515 --> 00:29:50.265
I don't know all the answers, but

00:29:51.315 --> 00:29:54.265
we certainly all came from humble means.

00:29:57.995 --> 00:30:00.245
No family name to speak of.

00:30:01.715 --> 00:30:04.215
I was very good at what I did.

00:30:05.173 --> 00:30:06.840
Even at a young age.

00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:14.734
Eadwulf was not only very capable,

00:30:14.734 --> 00:30:18.284
but he was strong,

00:30:18.284 --> 00:30:20.616
and I think that caught Trent's eye.

00:30:22.241 --> 00:30:23.324
And Astrid...

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.663
Maybe is a bit like...

00:30:33.129 --> 00:30:35.138
Trent, maybe that's unkind.

00:30:35.138 --> 00:30:37.046
She had a hunger.

00:30:39.646 --> 00:30:40.970
Ambition.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.828
LAURA: Do you think the Academy knows what he does?

00:30:44.828 --> 00:30:45.865
TRAVIS: Who, Trent?

00:30:45.865 --> 00:30:49.108
LAURA: Yeah, do you think like, Ludinus goes, "Okay, Trent,

00:30:49.108 --> 00:30:50.756
"now go find the people and now we'll have them

00:30:50.756 --> 00:30:53.324
"go do horrible things," or do you think it's like,

00:30:53.324 --> 00:30:56.857
he knows that Trent finds these good wizards

00:30:56.857 --> 00:30:58.653
and brings them up to the forefront.

00:30:58.653 --> 00:31:02.575
Do you think anybody else knows
the brutal things that he does?

00:31:02.575 --> 00:31:04.282
MARISHA: Someone knows.

00:31:04.282 --> 00:31:07.129
LIAM: The Academy I do not believe knows.

00:31:07.129 --> 00:31:09.745
The Assembly...
MARISHA: The Assembly, someone has to.

00:31:09.745 --> 00:31:12.461
LIAM: Some of them, Ludinus,

00:31:14.311 --> 00:31:16.519
intimated that he had some idea.

00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:20.401
LAURA: Well, I hate them all now.

00:31:20.401 --> 00:31:21.920
TRAVIS: Just so I have it clear.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.460
We're going to try and redeem Astrid and Eadwulf,

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.068
but Trent, fuck him, right?

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.957
Or are you trying to...

00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:36.889
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, it's always been a fuck Trent, right?

00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:38.472
TRAVIS: Just to be clear.

00:31:40.917 --> 00:31:42.686
LAURA: Oh no, do you sort of like Trent?

00:31:42.686 --> 00:31:44.291
Do you have like some weird thing

00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:47.474
because he like treated you nice a long time ago?

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.734
TALIESIN: I think a goal is always better than a grudge.

00:31:52.734 --> 00:31:54.329
What's the goal?

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:55.912
TRAVIS: That's very fair.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.993
TALIESIN: I have my theories.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:32:01.892 --> 00:32:05.252
I have said many times that I would like

00:32:05.252 --> 00:32:07.077
to surgically remove...

00:32:08.768 --> 00:32:10.935
the bad parts. It's not all bad here.

00:32:12.104 --> 00:32:15.670
TALIESIN: But--
LIAM: But it seems impossible.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.515
TALIESIN: This can't go on.

00:32:17.515 --> 00:32:19.958
No more of this.
LIAM: It could go on.

00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:22.107
It has for a long time.

00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:23.978
TALIESIN: Well, there's a goal.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:32:23.978 --> 00:32:25.078
TALIESIN: No more.

00:32:27.588 --> 00:32:32.580
LIAM: Whether that means exposing him or stopping him,

00:32:34.657 --> 00:32:37.537
maybe we will land on that, but I need to know more

00:32:37.537 --> 00:32:41.954
about what different members of the Assembly believe.

00:32:43.897 --> 00:32:47.064
MARISHA: If he's been teaching for that long,

00:32:48.265 --> 00:32:51.857
is there a chance that there are members in the Assembly

00:32:51.857 --> 00:32:54.367
who were his student at one point in time?

00:32:54.367 --> 00:32:55.551
LAURA: But just because you're his student

00:32:55.551 --> 00:32:57.648
doesn't mean that you're one of his proteges, right?

00:32:57.648 --> 00:33:00.012
TALIESIN: Is there a chance there's more like you?

00:33:01.545 --> 00:33:03.204
MARISHA: That's what I'm kind of getting at.

00:33:03.204 --> 00:33:04.636
TALIESIN: Got away.

00:33:04.636 --> 00:33:07.578
MARISHA: Maybe there are more allies out there.

00:33:07.578 --> 00:33:11.258
LIAM: That's a very good question. I do not know the answer.

00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:15.393
I spent a very long time trying to stay

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.393
as far away as possible.

00:33:19.835 --> 00:33:22.085
TALIESIN: Quite possibly not alone.

00:33:25.854 --> 00:33:27.137
LIAM: Well...

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.144
I take a lot of faith by what
we achieved on the ocean.

00:33:35.286 --> 00:33:38.269
This nation doesn't need to be...

00:33:39.302 --> 00:33:40.868
steeped in fear.

00:33:45.303 --> 00:33:49.404
The Empire has slighted the Dynasty, it has taken

00:33:49.404 --> 00:33:54.104
a cherished religious artifact from them.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:56.919
Bloodshed is stopped because we

00:33:56.919 --> 00:33:59.319
merely gave them what was theirs.

00:34:02.274 --> 00:34:05.158
If that is not a lesson for people in power,

00:34:08.982 --> 00:34:11.490
maybe they do not deserve the power.

00:34:16.738 --> 00:34:21.655
Or maybe this system is too corrupt, I don't know.

00:34:21.655 --> 00:34:25.841
MARISHA: I think it depends on
how deep the corruption has gone.

00:34:25.841 --> 00:34:27.591
If it's worth saving.

00:34:29.432 --> 00:34:31.871
If something's too far poisoned, maybe it's better

00:34:31.871 --> 00:34:35.063
to burn it to the ground and start something fresh.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.857
LIAM: You and your brethren,

00:34:42.774 --> 00:34:44.083
you dabble in this.

00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:45.882
MARISHA: It's more or less what we do.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:34:45.882 --> 00:34:47.931
MARISHA: It's kind of our mission
statement that I just said.

00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:49.306
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:34:51.234 --> 00:34:52.484
Would they...

00:34:56.475 --> 00:34:58.642
if he needs to be cut out.

00:35:01.198 --> 00:35:03.656
MARISHA: Oh yeah.
LIAM: Would they stand by?

00:35:03.656 --> 00:35:04.589
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:35:06.206 --> 00:35:07.795
The Cobalt Soul and the Cerberus Assembly

00:35:07.795 --> 00:35:10.653
have butted heads for decades.

00:35:12.285 --> 00:35:14.894
It's kind of the checks and balances system.

00:35:14.894 --> 00:35:19.493
And I just to try-- just try to not let myself

00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:24.410
be too naive to the fact that corruption exists everywhere.

00:35:25.943 --> 00:35:28.443
I think I can be an expositor,

00:35:29.704 --> 00:35:32.537
utilize the resources given to me,

00:35:34.453 --> 00:35:36.887
and not have to be blind to the flaws.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.426
LIAM: What about taint within the Cobalt Soul?

00:35:41.426 --> 00:35:42.571
Possible?

00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:44.184
MARISHA: Of course.

00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:45.875
LIAM: Have you seen it?

00:35:47.903 --> 00:35:48.736
MARISHA: No.

00:35:51.009 --> 00:35:52.047
Not to my knowledge.

00:35:52.047 --> 00:35:55.115
Not to my knowledge, not really?

00:35:55.115 --> 00:35:58.244
MATT: If there has been, it's been dealt with so swiftly

00:35:58.244 --> 00:36:01.328
that by the time anyone discovers, it's already gone.

00:36:01.328 --> 00:36:03.761
Or it's so far up the chain that nobody knows.

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:04.594
MARISHA: Right.

00:36:04.594 --> 00:36:08.245
MATT: I mean, it's hard to tell at a certain point.

00:36:08.245 --> 00:36:12.055
But as far as you know-- there are those, of course,

00:36:12.055 --> 00:36:16.188
with any sort of structure that do fall to corruption,

00:36:16.188 --> 00:36:20.272
but because it is a worldwide network,

00:36:22.498 --> 00:36:24.098
there's a lot more--
MARISHA: A bit more accountability.

00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:28.573
MATT: There's a lot more accountability
than other, more locally political structures.

00:36:28.573 --> 00:36:31.204
So it has a higher success rate.

00:36:33.716 --> 00:36:36.460
MARISHA: It's the common belief in the Soul

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.900
to share what knowledge is known.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.959
Especially amongst the branches.

00:36:43.759 --> 00:36:46.573
LIAM: (inhales, sighs)

00:36:46.573 --> 00:36:51.573
Well, tomorrow night can be a first step, but

00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:55.145
one, I need Veth.

00:36:55.145 --> 00:36:57.120
And two, we are...

00:36:59.053 --> 00:36:59.886
rode hard.

00:36:59.886 --> 00:37:02.938
We cannot show up tomorrow night looking like this.

00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:05.138
MARISHA: Oh.

00:37:07.263 --> 00:37:09.727
Should I take the pooka shell necklace off, then?

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:12.061
(laughter)

00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:13.052
All right.

00:37:13.052 --> 00:37:14.339
LAURA: I think it's that good look.

00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:15.289
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:37:15.289 --> 00:37:17.197
TALIESIN: The urge to show up in the Dynasty finest

00:37:17.197 --> 00:37:19.125
is almost overpowering.

00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:21.808
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (laugh)

00:37:21.808 --> 00:37:23.473
MARISHA: We talked about going back tonight for dinner

00:37:23.473 --> 00:37:25.069
and getting ceviche.

00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:26.014
LAURA: That's true.

00:37:26.014 --> 00:37:30.418
We could go back to Nicodranas and clean up real good,

00:37:30.418 --> 00:37:34.955
you know. Got lots of fancy clothes at the Lavish Chateau.

00:37:34.955 --> 00:37:38.625
TALIESIN: We still have those outfits, don't we, there?

00:37:38.625 --> 00:37:40.327
LAURA: Our evening wear?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:37:40.327 --> 00:37:41.160
LAURA: Oh yeah.

00:37:42.897 --> 00:37:44.804
MARISHA: Did he say that the dress was formal?

00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:46.494
Is that a thing?

00:37:46.494 --> 00:37:47.661
Do we hafta?

00:37:50.457 --> 00:37:53.236
I'm just curious if it was stated.

00:37:53.236 --> 00:37:54.533
LIAM: No, it was not.

00:37:54.533 --> 00:37:56.249
LAURA: Not formal, or not stated?

00:37:56.249 --> 00:37:57.862
LIAM: Not stated.

00:37:57.862 --> 00:38:00.244
LAURA: I think you should step it up

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:02.577
and make them feel underdressed.

00:38:02.577 --> 00:38:04.705
MARISHA: That's true, that's true.

00:38:04.705 --> 00:38:07.497
LAURA: We are fully outnumbering them,

00:38:07.497 --> 00:38:11.638
so they will feel out of place in their own home.

00:38:12.982 --> 00:38:14.565
TALIESIN: Do clean up well.

00:38:15.872 --> 00:38:18.030
TRAVIS: They wouldn't poison us, would they?

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.876
TALIESIN: I'll try and be prepared for that.

00:38:20.876 --> 00:38:22.726
LAURA: Oh, yes, yes.
TRAVIS: (nervous laugh)

00:38:23.981 --> 00:38:24.894
Okay.

00:38:24.894 --> 00:38:27.901
MARISHA: I could also be the taste tester, right?

00:38:29.209 --> 00:38:31.682
TRAVIS: Do you have some monk shit where you're--

00:38:31.682 --> 00:38:33.239
LAURA: Would you know if you'd been poisoned?

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:35.747
MARISHA: I can will poison out of my pores.

00:38:35.747 --> 00:38:36.975
TRAVIS: Sure you can.

00:38:36.975 --> 00:38:40.002
LAURA: Ew, I bet it smells so bad after you do it, though.

00:38:40.002 --> 00:38:41.037
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

00:38:41.037 --> 00:38:43.472
TALIESIN: Does your sweat smell after that?
MARISHA: Yeah, like--

00:38:43.472 --> 00:38:44.538
MATT: Like you've eaten a lot of garlic.

00:38:44.538 --> 00:38:45.911
MARISHA: I was going to say rotten mushrooms.

00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:48.976
You ever leave a pot of mushrooms on the stove for too long?

00:38:48.976 --> 00:38:51.468
LIAM: Maybe it smells like asparagus pee?

00:38:51.468 --> 00:38:53.094
MATT: There you go, there you go.

00:38:54.386 --> 00:38:57.278
LAURA: Like definite, like you know.

00:38:57.278 --> 00:38:58.760
(laughter)

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.880
It was poison; she was definitely poisoned.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.482
(groaning)

00:39:03.482 --> 00:39:05.662
MARISHA: The pheromone, it's a defense mechanism.

00:39:05.662 --> 00:39:06.495
MATT: Oh god.

00:39:08.597 --> 00:39:09.613
All right.

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:11.900
LAURA: Do you know that only happens to some people?

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.733
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:39:12.733 --> 00:39:13.566
MARISHA: The asparagus and pee thing?

00:39:13.566 --> 00:39:16.988
LAURA: Yeah, not everybody gets the asparagus pee smell.

00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:19.945
MATT: Weird.
LIAM: Some people named Liam.

00:39:19.945 --> 00:39:21.877
(laughter)

00:39:21.877 --> 00:39:23.556
MATT: ♪ The more you know ♪

00:39:23.556 --> 00:39:25.668
(laughter)

00:39:25.668 --> 00:39:29.545
MATT: Well, you have, effectively, a day and a half or so

00:39:29.545 --> 00:39:31.995
until that dinner invitation.

00:39:31.995 --> 00:39:33.770
So what would you like to do in the interim?

00:39:34.697 --> 00:39:36.567
LAURA: Do you want me to send a message

00:39:36.567 --> 00:39:38.545
to Trent and let him know that we'll be there?

00:39:38.545 --> 00:39:41.295
I can ask what the dress code is.

00:39:44.557 --> 00:39:46.247
LIAM: I think there is nothing I would love more

00:39:46.247 --> 00:39:50.292
than for you to send a message to Master Ikithon

00:39:50.292 --> 00:39:51.494
accepting his invitation.

00:39:51.494 --> 00:39:53.153
LAURA: You got it, Caleb.

00:39:57.277 --> 00:39:58.539
I'm going to send a message.

00:39:58.539 --> 00:40:00.147
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

00:40:02.908 --> 00:40:05.339
LAURA: Dearest Trent!

00:40:05.339 --> 00:40:08.185
Hey, got your message to Caleb.

00:40:08.185 --> 00:40:10.832
We will def be there.

00:40:10.832 --> 00:40:14.484
Can't wait to see what your house looks like.

00:40:15.501 --> 00:40:16.635
Any dress code?

00:40:16.635 --> 00:40:18.224
SAM and LIAM: Ooh!

00:40:18.224 --> 00:40:20.793
ASHLEY: Dang!

00:40:20.793 --> 00:40:22.809
LAURA: I'm getting good at this, you guys!
LIAM: Stuck the landing.

00:40:22.809 --> 00:40:23.759
MARISHA: Growth!

00:40:24.827 --> 00:40:27.136
MATT: A rapid response comes.

00:40:28.477 --> 00:40:33.477
"Ah. Well then, I look forward to seeing all of you.

00:40:34.108 --> 00:40:36.602
"No particular dress code.

00:40:36.602 --> 00:40:39.352
"Wear what is comfortable, please."

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.623
That's all.

00:40:41.623 --> 00:40:44.298
TALIESIN: Fancy.
TRAVIS: 19 words, pretty good.

00:40:44.298 --> 00:40:47.125
LAURA: He's got a slimy, slimy voice,

00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:50.766
but he says we can wear whatever's comfortable.

00:40:50.766 --> 00:40:52.661
I say we wear formal wear.

00:40:53.602 --> 00:40:54.755
TALIESIN: Agreed.

00:40:54.755 --> 00:40:55.768
MARISHA: I'm into that.

00:40:55.768 --> 00:40:56.793
TRAVIS: Ugh.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.803
LAURA: Or should we wear our armor?

00:41:00.803 --> 00:41:02.021
That might be important.

00:41:02.021 --> 00:41:05.353
TRAVIS: Just-- I'm going into an enemy's house, you know.

00:41:05.353 --> 00:41:08.480
LAURA: We can wear our armor and then some fancy accents.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.720
How about that?

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.818
MARISHA: Do you have any, like, rip away dresses, you know?

00:41:12.818 --> 00:41:16.051
So we can, like, wear our gear, but then be like...

00:41:16.051 --> 00:41:17.621
TALIESIN: Technically, aren't in all clothes rip away,

00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:18.553
if you're strong enough?

00:41:18.553 --> 00:41:20.479
TRAVIS: Ha ha!

00:41:20.479 --> 00:41:21.539
MARISHA: You're right.

00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:23.063
LAURA: (laughs)

00:41:23.063 --> 00:41:23.896
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:41:23.896 --> 00:41:24.957
TALIESIN: I'll do this real good, hold on.

00:41:24.957 --> 00:41:27.475
LIAM: But seriously, please treat this

00:41:27.475 --> 00:41:29.813
like we are going in on a fact-finding mission,

00:41:29.813 --> 00:41:33.305
but also be prepared for it to be a total bloodbath.

00:41:33.305 --> 00:41:34.138
LAURA: Got it.
TALIESIN: Always.

00:41:34.138 --> 00:41:37.061
TRAVIS: Good, good parameters.
LAURA: Be prepared for murder.

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:38.312
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:41:38.312 --> 00:41:42.353
LAURA: So wait, is our goal to murder him tomorrow night?

00:41:42.353 --> 00:41:43.965
Should we, if there's an opportunity,

00:41:43.965 --> 00:41:46.866
should we just murder him?

00:41:46.866 --> 00:41:49.836
LIAM: Let's make that plan G.

00:41:49.836 --> 00:41:51.094
TRAVIS: G.

00:41:51.094 --> 00:41:52.344
LIAM: For tomorrow.

00:41:53.794 --> 00:41:56.857
TALIESIN: I'm very proud of you;
I was expecting that to be plan C.

00:41:56.857 --> 00:41:59.020
Plan G, that's growth.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:02.109
LIAM: Well, we need to figure out if there are

00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:03.759
more people to murder.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.048
So.
LAURA: Okay.

00:42:06.048 --> 00:42:07.967
TALIESIN: Or people who've been waiting for the moment

00:42:07.967 --> 00:42:11.537
to get out from under his thumb.

00:42:11.537 --> 00:42:12.756
LIAM: We just need to know more.

00:42:12.756 --> 00:42:16.250
LAURA: Do you think all this time that maybe, like--

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:20.455
Do you feel like when you were here,

00:42:20.455 --> 00:42:24.143
do you feel like you were being controlled?

00:42:24.143 --> 00:42:25.945
Or do you-- was it, like, your choice?

00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:30.159
Do you feel like maybe they, like, were subtly

00:42:30.159 --> 00:42:32.919
controlling you and you just didn't know?

00:42:34.277 --> 00:42:35.110
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:42:36.338 --> 00:42:37.421
LIAM: No, Jester.

00:42:41.479 --> 00:42:42.312
No.

00:42:44.855 --> 00:42:48.563
I am a different person

00:42:48.563 --> 00:42:51.504
in every way.

00:42:53.607 --> 00:42:55.390
I relished my work.

00:42:58.335 --> 00:43:00.002
We were riding high.

00:43:02.788 --> 00:43:04.363
Serving the king.

00:43:07.231 --> 00:43:08.515
Tasting power.

00:43:11.837 --> 00:43:13.145
This is why it...

00:43:16.246 --> 00:43:18.055
This is why I have never...

00:43:19.923 --> 00:43:21.006
It's hard.

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.727
MARISHA: I think that was the first time

00:43:23.727 --> 00:43:27.076
I've ever heard you admit or recognize

00:43:27.076 --> 00:43:29.776
that you were a different person back then.

00:43:35.393 --> 00:43:36.537
Good work.

00:43:36.537 --> 00:43:38.470
LAURA: (laughs)

00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:46.123
MARISHA: Ceviche?

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:48.745
LIAM: Yeah, how do we want to do this?

00:43:48.745 --> 00:43:50.797
MARISHA: Do you have a thingy? You said you have a thingy.

00:43:50.797 --> 00:43:55.339
LIAM: Yeah, I have a thingy. We could impose on

00:43:55.339 --> 00:43:57.580
our wizard friend again, or we could just

00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.747
go straight to your house.

00:44:00.982 --> 00:44:03.413
LAURA: Let's go straight to the house. Why not?

00:44:03.413 --> 00:44:05.504
TALIESIN: Let's do that thing
while we're at your house, by the way.

00:44:05.504 --> 00:44:07.402
The poof.

00:44:07.402 --> 00:44:12.402
Where we make the circle and then the teleporty thingy.

00:44:12.615 --> 00:44:14.462
LAURA: The teleporty thingy at the house?

00:44:14.462 --> 00:44:16.626
TALIESIN: At your mom's house, we could set up the--

00:44:16.626 --> 00:44:17.924
LAURA: Oh, we can make our thingy!

00:44:17.924 --> 00:44:19.076
TALIESIN: Yeah, the thingy.

00:44:19.076 --> 00:44:20.739
LAURA: I love it. Okay.
TALIESIN: We'll do that.

00:44:20.739 --> 00:44:22.995
LAURA: We have to make it a little temple, you know.

00:44:22.995 --> 00:44:24.248
TALIESIN: I love making little temples.

00:44:24.248 --> 00:44:25.089
LAURA: Okay.

00:44:25.089 --> 00:44:26.694
TRAVIS: Oh, by the way, when we went shopping,

00:44:26.694 --> 00:44:28.737
we bought two regular healing potions.

00:44:28.737 --> 00:44:31.161
Does anyone not have one?

00:44:31.161 --> 00:44:32.327
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Rummaging through my bag.

00:44:32.327 --> 00:44:34.464
LAURA: I don't think I have a healing potion.

00:44:34.464 --> 00:44:36.582
Maybe I do, hold on.

00:44:36.582 --> 00:44:38.848
ASHLEY: Up for grabs.

00:44:38.848 --> 00:44:40.238
Is that all we got?

00:44:40.238 --> 00:44:41.170
TRAVIS: Yeah, we only got two.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.640
LAURA: Oh, I've got a healing potion.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.676
TRAVIS: And some dope-ass jewelry.

00:44:44.676 --> 00:44:46.103
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:44:46.103 --> 00:44:47.750
LAURA: That is a really beautiful ring.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.212
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:44:49.212 --> 00:44:50.787
Got it for a steal.

00:44:51.675 --> 00:44:53.704
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:44:53.704 --> 00:44:55.915
ASHLEY: Wait, how many of those...?

00:44:55.915 --> 00:44:56.846
TRAVIS: Two, two and two.

00:44:56.846 --> 00:44:58.618
ASHLEY: No, the--
TRAVIS: Yeah, the fire?

00:44:58.618 --> 00:44:59.782
ASHLEY: The fire things.
TRAVIS: <i>Dos.</i>

00:44:59.782 --> 00:45:01.280
ASHLEY: I thought we got more than that.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.373
I thought it was like a pack of...

00:45:03.373 --> 00:45:04.391
TRAVIS: This shithead said two.

00:45:04.391 --> 00:45:05.451
I don't know, I thought it was two.

00:45:05.451 --> 00:45:06.576
LAURA: I thought it was a box

00:45:06.576 --> 00:45:08.913
with two balls in 'em.

00:45:08.913 --> 00:45:09.754
Is that right?

00:45:09.754 --> 00:45:11.475
TRAVIS: Alchemical fire? Alchemist fire?

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:12.308
MATT: Alchemist fire?

00:45:12.308 --> 00:45:14.642
LAURA: It was a box with one, two balls.

00:45:16.157 --> 00:45:17.791
MARISHA: I feel like it was a 12 pack or an eight--

00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:19.191
LAURA: Was it?
ASHLEY: I feel like it was a 12 packer. Yeah.

00:45:19.191 --> 00:45:21.732
MATT: It was a fair amount of them.

00:45:21.732 --> 00:45:23.323
LAURA: Oh shit.
MATT: I rely on you guys

00:45:23.323 --> 00:45:25.124
to keep track of the items once they get to you.
TRAVIS: I thought you were taking notes.

00:45:25.124 --> 00:45:27.082
You taking notes? I thought I was...

00:45:28.299 --> 00:45:29.407
Marisha takes notes.

00:45:29.407 --> 00:45:31.262
ASHLEY: Listen, I have one celebone,

00:45:31.262 --> 00:45:33.897
two oops-stones, and two chuckle dust.

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:36.961
Those are the only things I wrote down that I had.

00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:37.794
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: Well then, you better

00:45:37.794 --> 00:45:39.811
not use them until you confirm with Dani, then.

00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:42.308
TRAVIS: I'll go consult the Loremaster.

00:45:42.308 --> 00:45:44.275
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to find this out.

00:45:44.275 --> 00:45:45.641
MARISHA: Just Slack Dani.

00:45:45.641 --> 00:45:47.321
LAURA: She'll know. Text her.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:45:47.321 --> 00:45:49.958
(laughter)

00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:50.791
MATT: All right.

00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:54.374
LIAM: All right. So I will pull out the little turtle statue

00:45:54.374 --> 00:45:55.893
that Jester gave me from her home,

00:45:55.893 --> 00:45:58.892
and grip it in my hand and--
LAURA: Don't crush it!

00:45:58.892 --> 00:46:03.059
LIAM: Oh, my grip is so weak. I have a Strength of 10.

00:46:04.326 --> 00:46:06.224
And--
LAURA: And don't let it hurt you.

00:46:06.224 --> 00:46:07.875
(laughter)

00:46:07.875 --> 00:46:11.643
LIAM: It is in fact jabbing straight through my palm.

00:46:11.643 --> 00:46:14.698
The circle took some futzing, but this is instantaneous.

00:46:14.698 --> 00:46:17.950
So he just mutters a few words and then whoosh.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:21.158
LAURA: All of us? Do we have to
be holding hands or anything?

00:46:21.158 --> 00:46:22.499
MATT: I do not believe you have to be holding hands.

00:46:22.499 --> 00:46:23.406
TALIESIN: We can.

00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:24.662
LAURA: Oh. Just to be safe.

00:46:24.662 --> 00:46:26.526
MATT: Right, for this one?
LIAM: No.

00:46:26.526 --> 00:46:28.236
LAURA: Okay, wow. We just whirl.
LIAM: Verbal?

00:46:28.236 --> 00:46:29.640
TRAVIS: Caleb just disappears.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.122
(laughter)
LAURA: Well, that sucks.

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.264
LIAM: Later, bitches!

00:46:33.264 --> 00:46:35.388
(laughter)

00:46:35.388 --> 00:46:37.113
TALIESIN: Ah, man.
LAURA: Ceviche!

00:46:37.113 --> 00:46:38.382
TRAVIS: This is part of it, right? This is part of it?

00:46:38.382 --> 00:46:39.215
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: This is part of it?

00:46:39.215 --> 00:46:40.962
This is part of it.

00:46:40.962 --> 00:46:41.795
MATT: Yeah, you don't have to touch hands.

00:46:41.795 --> 00:46:43.020
You have to do it within 10 feet of you.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.126
LAURA: Okay.

00:46:44.126 --> 00:46:47.351
MATT: So yes, as you all gather in a small circle,

00:46:47.351 --> 00:46:48.708
Caleb mutters something under his breath

00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:53.233
and then, no circle on the ground, no extended preparation,

00:46:53.233 --> 00:46:56.479
you all just suddenly feel that that drifting sensation

00:46:56.479 --> 00:46:58.973
in your stomach, that brief rising,

00:46:58.973 --> 00:47:01.311
almost weightless sensation for a split second,

00:47:01.311 --> 00:47:05.518
and then with a blink of light-- where are they?

00:47:05.518 --> 00:47:07.935
LIAM: We are in the lobby of the Lavish Chateau.

00:47:07.935 --> 00:47:09.829
MATT: (boof) You guys are now right in the center

00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:12.588
of the now shaded interior of the Lavish Chateau,

00:47:12.588 --> 00:47:14.500
midday in Nicodranas.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.884
LAURA: (gasps)

00:47:15.884 --> 00:47:16.991
MATT: As you land there, you can hear

00:47:16.991 --> 00:47:18.321
there's a little bit of music playing.

00:47:18.321 --> 00:47:19.573
It's not too terribly crowded.

00:47:19.573 --> 00:47:20.972
There's maybe like four individuals

00:47:20.972 --> 00:47:23.871
that are in from their dock work just getting a drink.

00:47:23.871 --> 00:47:24.704
A little higher than their pay grade,

00:47:24.704 --> 00:47:28.067
but because they like the way it's made here.

00:47:28.067 --> 00:47:29.628
Also, momentarily you hear what sounds like

00:47:29.628 --> 00:47:32.491
a (boof, barking).

00:47:32.491 --> 00:47:33.324
LAURA: (gasps)

00:47:33.324 --> 00:47:36.462
MATT: And you glance over and see Nugget just

00:47:36.462 --> 00:47:37.604
apparate as well.

00:47:37.604 --> 00:47:39.945
LAURA: Nugget!
MATT: (panting, yips)

00:47:39.945 --> 00:47:41.553
Then runs up and like...

00:47:41.553 --> 00:47:42.873
(sniffing)

00:47:42.873 --> 00:47:45.374
LAURA: It's me. It's Jester.
MATT: (yips)

00:47:45.374 --> 00:47:47.124
LAURA: Your original mommy,

00:47:47.124 --> 00:47:48.469
but I understand if you don't feel like

00:47:48.469 --> 00:47:50.295
I'm your mommy anymore.

00:47:51.435 --> 00:47:53.246
MATT: Just starts licking your hand.

00:47:53.246 --> 00:47:55.015
Now, Nugget's been gone here for quite some time

00:47:55.015 --> 00:47:57.874
being watched by Marion, and is significantly larger

00:47:57.874 --> 00:48:00.834
than you last remember him being.

00:48:00.834 --> 00:48:02.996
Still nowhere near a full grown blink dog,

00:48:02.996 --> 00:48:05.292
but in between the period, maybe, you know,

00:48:05.292 --> 00:48:07.343
from nose to tail about that big.

00:48:07.343 --> 00:48:11.215
And so is still like a bit of an unwieldy creature

00:48:11.215 --> 00:48:12.250
for the expectation.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.276
LAURA: I like to think that Nugget blinks back and forth

00:48:14.276 --> 00:48:17.396
between the Lavish Chateau and Veth's family home.

00:48:17.396 --> 00:48:19.028
MATT: Yeah, we'll say for the past, you know,

00:48:19.028 --> 00:48:21.231
number of hours, with your arrival,

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:25.026
there's been a bit of-- especially with Luc living here,

00:48:25.026 --> 00:48:28.941
Luc has taken a personal interest in playing with Nugget

00:48:28.941 --> 00:48:31.569
in the time that he spent here.
TRAVIS: How do Sprinkle and Nugget get along?

00:48:31.569 --> 00:48:32.801
SAM: Well, one's alive.

00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:35.475
(laughter)

00:48:35.475 --> 00:48:37.004
LAURA: I brought you a chew toy!

00:48:37.004 --> 00:48:39.016
SAM: Nugget comes over to our house

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:40.507
and just poops and then goes back.

00:48:40.507 --> 00:48:41.662
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:41.662 --> 00:48:42.820
SAM: What the fuck?

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.359
(laughter)

00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:47.935
MATT: Yeza's like, "It's been an experience."

00:48:47.935 --> 00:48:49.225
(laughter)

00:48:49.225 --> 00:48:50.084
TRAVIS: Every morning.

00:48:50.084 --> 00:48:52.637
MATT: "Hard to catch him, the... asshole."

00:48:52.637 --> 00:48:54.215
But yeah, nevertheless, you are here in the Chateau,

00:48:54.215 --> 00:48:56.341
Nicodranas is your oyster.

00:48:57.399 --> 00:48:59.442
MARISHA: Should we crash Veth?

00:48:59.442 --> 00:49:00.866
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: The Brenatto family?

00:49:00.866 --> 00:49:01.789
See what they're up to?

00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:03.815
LAURA: Oh, I should find out exactly where she lives.

00:49:03.815 --> 00:49:05.683
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LAURA: I'll go ask Mama.

00:49:05.683 --> 00:49:07.288
And I run upstairs with Nugget.

00:49:07.288 --> 00:49:08.538
MATT: You run upstairs.

00:49:08.538 --> 00:49:09.652
As you're running up the stairs with Nugget,

00:49:09.652 --> 00:49:12.393
you hear (thudding) and then his footfalls stop

00:49:12.393 --> 00:49:13.959
and you look up and he's already waiting for you

00:49:13.959 --> 00:49:15.010
at the top of the landing.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.510
LAURA: You're such a cool dog!
MATT: (panting)

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:20.662
You head up into the room, and as you--

00:49:20.662 --> 00:49:22.362
Do you knock on the door or just push in?

00:49:22.362 --> 00:49:23.862
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Which do you do?

00:49:24.838 --> 00:49:25.907
LAURA: Knock on the door and push in.

00:49:25.907 --> 00:49:28.831
(laughter)
MATT: Okay.

00:49:28.831 --> 00:49:30.750
As you go inside, you can see your mother

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.421
is currently sitting at her little vanity

00:49:33.421 --> 00:49:35.838
and is in the process of brushing her hair back

00:49:35.838 --> 00:49:38.741
and turns around and goes, "Oh Jester, you're back already."

00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:39.574
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:39.574 --> 00:49:42.324
You know, we can just come now whenever.

00:49:42.324 --> 00:49:45.463
Literally, we can just stop in for a night all the time now.

00:49:45.463 --> 00:49:48.715
MATT: "Well, you're welcome to come
whenever you wish to, please.

00:49:48.715 --> 00:49:50.562
"Anytime."
LAURA: Should we let you know?

00:49:50.562 --> 00:49:53.328
MATT: "Maybe just for the sake of--

00:49:53.328 --> 00:49:54.478
"might be a very busy night,

00:49:54.478 --> 00:49:56.088
"but if you're coming to visit,

00:49:56.088 --> 00:49:58.578
"give me a little bit of a heads up and I am

00:49:58.578 --> 00:50:00.656
"more than happy to have you.

00:50:00.656 --> 00:50:02.043
"That is wonderful news."

00:50:02.043 --> 00:50:04.202
LAURA: Yeah, so we can just stay here tonight,

00:50:04.202 --> 00:50:05.879
and we're going to have some dinner.

00:50:05.879 --> 00:50:07.710
We're going to check out-- oh, we're going to check out

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:10.062
Veth's house, I should probably find out where that is.

00:50:10.062 --> 00:50:11.390
MATT: "Oh, right this way."
LAURA: Okay.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:13.739
MATT: She stands up and tucks her little stool

00:50:13.739 --> 00:50:15.537
beneath the vanity, leads you over to the balcony

00:50:15.537 --> 00:50:17.613
and points across the way of the open,

00:50:17.613 --> 00:50:18.682
the section of the Opal Archways,

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:19.858
from where the Lavish Chateau is,

00:50:19.858 --> 00:50:23.692
there is this very circular-style

00:50:23.692 --> 00:50:26.204
there is this very circular-style

00:50:26.204 --> 00:50:29.593
thoroughfare, like this of main plaza area in the center

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:31.442
where there's a fountain, and you can see there's

00:50:31.442 --> 00:50:33.159
a number of these silk streamers that attach

00:50:33.159 --> 00:50:36.557
from the top of the fountain
to the different corners of this region.

00:50:36.557 --> 00:50:39.665
She points over to this one collection of buildings

00:50:39.665 --> 00:50:44.605
that have abodes in both floors and series.

00:50:44.605 --> 00:50:46.389
It looks the equivalent of an apartment complex,

00:50:46.389 --> 00:50:47.502
if you will.

00:50:47.502 --> 00:50:50.348
But very, very well built and beautiful,

00:50:50.348 --> 00:50:52.080
and points over towards the corner and goes,

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.573
"That is where the Brenattos have been living."

00:50:54.573 --> 00:50:56.177
LAURA: Oh, perfect.

00:50:56.177 --> 00:50:58.416
We will go over there, but I'll be back, okay?

00:50:58.416 --> 00:50:59.249
MATT: "Of course.

00:50:59.249 --> 00:51:00.601
"I'll be here if you need me."
LAURA: Okay.

00:51:00.601 --> 00:51:03.611
As I start to run away, I stop and turn around at the door

00:51:03.611 --> 00:51:05.352
and say:

00:51:05.352 --> 00:51:09.318
Have you heard anything else from Lord Sharpe?

00:51:09.318 --> 00:51:14.243
Have you heard anything else from Lord Sharpe?

00:51:15.671 --> 00:51:18.838
MATT: "Not at the moment, but he has...

00:51:19.908 --> 00:51:22.236
"He hasn't been a client for a bit of time."

00:51:22.236 --> 00:51:25.369
LAURA: Not anything since the party?

00:51:25.369 --> 00:51:26.953
MATT: "No."

00:51:26.953 --> 00:51:28.561
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "Why?"

00:51:28.561 --> 00:51:30.970
LAURA: I was just wondering.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:32.505
I was just wondering.

00:51:32.505 --> 00:51:33.870
MATT: "Okay."

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:35.202
LAURA: I love you!

00:51:35.202 --> 00:51:36.910
MATT: "I love you too, Jester."

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.382
LAURA: And I ran down the stairs.

00:51:38.382 --> 00:51:39.215
MATT: Okay.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:45.460
So, as you all gathered at the bottom of the Lavish Chateau,

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.788
where are you off to?

00:51:46.788 --> 00:51:48.525
LAURA: I tell her exactly, I'll tell everybody

00:51:48.525 --> 00:51:52.288
where Veth lives. Should we head off there immediately?

00:51:52.288 --> 00:51:54.924
LIAM: We need our ninth member.

00:51:54.924 --> 00:51:56.641
MARISHA: Let's go.

00:51:56.641 --> 00:51:58.463
Kick down her door.

00:51:58.463 --> 00:52:00.156
Break all of her plates.

00:52:00.156 --> 00:52:01.142
Eat all of her food.

00:52:01.142 --> 00:52:03.194
LIAM: Like friends do.
MARISHA: Drink all of her booze.

00:52:03.194 --> 00:52:05.172
MATT: (chuckling)
MARISHA: It's going to be great.

00:52:05.172 --> 00:52:07.240
MATT: Now Veth, what have you been up to

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.220
since they've been gone?

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.014
SAM: Well, it's only been, like, 10 hours.

00:52:11.014 --> 00:52:12.575
(laughter)

00:52:12.575 --> 00:52:15.303
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: So not a whole lot?

00:52:15.303 --> 00:52:18.388
We had a day, we walked around, went to the beach,

00:52:18.388 --> 00:52:21.788
went to the farmer's market,

00:52:21.788 --> 00:52:24.526
had a lunch outside.

00:52:24.526 --> 00:52:26.745
We're probably cooking, getting ready for

00:52:26.745 --> 00:52:28.762
a really nice dinner when--

00:52:28.762 --> 00:52:30.007
LAURA: Little dinner.
SAM: Yeah,

00:52:30.007 --> 00:52:32.029
when knock, knock, knock, I guess.

00:52:32.029 --> 00:52:33.151
(laughter)

00:52:33.151 --> 00:52:34.201
TRAVIS: Knock knock. (slamming)

00:52:34.201 --> 00:52:36.626
TALIESIN, MARISHA, ASHLEY: Hey!

00:52:36.626 --> 00:52:38.870
MARISHA: Oh god, it smells so good!

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:40.234
What are you cooking?

00:52:40.234 --> 00:52:41.867
TRAVIS: Oh, hand me some of that, will you?

00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:42.700
MARISHA: Do you have chairs?
MATT: (as Yeza) "Should I--"

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:43.784
MARISHA: We could pull up some chairs.

00:52:43.784 --> 00:52:46.000
TALIESIN: I can just--
SAM: We have four chairs.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.548
MATT: "Yeah, I can get some things,

00:52:47.548 --> 00:52:48.642
"I didn't realize were having company."

00:52:48.642 --> 00:52:51.467
SAM: I didn't either, They just left!

00:52:51.467 --> 00:52:53.571
LAURA: We can eat on the floor. It's okay, I don't mind.

00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.356
SAM: Oh, no, no, we'll sit on the floor.

00:52:55.356 --> 00:52:57.034
We made sausages and things.

00:52:57.034 --> 00:52:58.197
MARISHA: What a nice balcony!

00:52:58.197 --> 00:52:59.881
I could sleep on the balcony.

00:52:59.881 --> 00:53:00.980
SAM: You're sleeping here?!

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.875
LAURA: No, no, no, we can sleep at the Lavish Chateau.

00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:05.207
There's plenty of rooms there.

00:53:05.207 --> 00:53:06.999
It's fine.
ASHLEY: I put Luc on my shoulders.

00:53:06.999 --> 00:53:08.930
SAM: Oh, that's tall.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.375
MATT: "I'm going to-- I'll be right back.

00:53:10.375 --> 00:53:12.056
"I'm just going to make a quick trip to just

00:53:12.056 --> 00:53:14.874
"grab a few things that we--"
LAURA: Do you need any help?

00:53:14.874 --> 00:53:18.505
MATT: "I'm fine, I can get to and from pretty quick."

00:53:18.505 --> 00:53:19.916
SAM: Okay, well, hurry back.

00:53:19.916 --> 00:53:22.990
Oh shit, I think I just stepped in dog shit.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:26.258
Oh my...
MATT: "(sighs)"

00:53:26.258 --> 00:53:28.276
SAM: Just go, I'll clean it up by
the time you get back here.

00:53:28.276 --> 00:53:29.985
LIAM: Yasha, be careful, the boy's head

00:53:29.985 --> 00:53:31.815
is practically scraping the ceiling.

00:53:31.815 --> 00:53:33.815
LAURA: Yeah, maybe duck a little bit.

00:53:33.815 --> 00:53:35.089
ASHLEY: You okay up there?

00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:36.839
MATT: (as Luc) "Yeah!

00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:38.744
"This is so cool!"

00:53:38.744 --> 00:53:40.173
TALIESIN: Careful of the ceiling fan.

00:53:40.173 --> 00:53:44.464
MATT: He's now doing like, arm flexing, muscles, like...

00:53:44.464 --> 00:53:45.841
ASHLEY: Ooh, so strong!

00:53:45.841 --> 00:53:49.379
(laughter)
ASHLEY: He's a tough boy.

00:53:49.379 --> 00:53:53.175
SAM: Wow, you guys were gone <i>so</i> long.

00:53:53.175 --> 00:53:55.862
(laughter)

00:53:55.862 --> 00:53:57.324
SAM: Do we have a new mission?

00:53:57.324 --> 00:53:58.790
MARISHA: So much has happened.

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:00.868
LAURA: Oh my gosh, so much.

00:54:00.868 --> 00:54:05.460
SAM: Recap everything that happened in order!

00:54:06.932 --> 00:54:08.329
MARISHA: And we do.

00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:10.743
(laughter)
MATT: Okay.

00:54:10.743 --> 00:54:13.043
LIAM: Thank you.
SAM: Wow!

00:54:13.043 --> 00:54:14.931
What a detailed account!

00:54:14.931 --> 00:54:16.992
MARISHA: Yeah. Bored Fjord.

00:54:16.992 --> 00:54:19.347
SAM: Wow. Anyway, my god.

00:54:19.347 --> 00:54:23.080
So we're going to dinner with the enemy.

00:54:24.022 --> 00:54:25.222
That's crazy.

00:54:25.222 --> 00:54:26.055
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:54:28.017 --> 00:54:30.559
SAM: Tomorrow, did you say? Or two days?

00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:32.647
LIAM: Tomorrow night. We can--
SAM: Tomorrow night.

00:54:32.647 --> 00:54:35.244
LIAM: -- enjoy the evening here.

00:54:35.244 --> 00:54:37.207
SAM: Yes, yes, yes.

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:39.518
And then tomorrow, are there preparations

00:54:39.518 --> 00:54:42.061
that we need to make, like, you know,

00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:46.210
like a code word or anything, or should we bring

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:49.500
a bomb in case things go awry, or?

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.438
LAURA: Ooh, good call.

00:54:51.438 --> 00:54:52.644
TALIESIN: Really?

00:54:52.644 --> 00:54:53.879
TRAVIS: You have a bomb just sitting?

00:54:53.879 --> 00:54:55.572
LAURA: Yeah, a bomb's always smart--
SAM: I have a bomb, yes.

00:54:55.572 --> 00:54:57.871
LAURA: -- to have, you know, around, just in case.

00:54:57.871 --> 00:55:00.780
SAM: Or we've got Yeza here.

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.744
I could make some sort of, I can have him make

00:55:03.744 --> 00:55:06.342
some sort of alchemical thing that we, like,

00:55:06.342 --> 00:55:10.846
just sprinkle into Ikithon's drink.
LAURA: It makes him shit all over himself!

00:55:10.846 --> 00:55:14.518
SAM: Yeah, I was thinking kill him, but you know.

00:55:14.518 --> 00:55:16.525
Or he can just shit all over himself.
TRAVIS: Shit himself is good, too.

00:55:16.525 --> 00:55:18.767
LAURA: Can you imagine how embarrassing it would be, though,

00:55:18.767 --> 00:55:21.018
if he just shit all over himself at the table

00:55:21.018 --> 00:55:22.590
in his own house?

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.222
SAM: That'd be pretty good.

00:55:24.222 --> 00:55:27.179
LIAM: I think our chances of murdering Trent Ikithon

00:55:27.179 --> 00:55:30.238
in his home are slim to none.

00:55:32.699 --> 00:55:34.848
TRAVIS: Good to know, good to know.

00:55:34.848 --> 00:55:39.290
LAURA: What if we lure him out onto a balcony or something?

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:41.179
LIAM: What if we go to dinner--

00:55:41.179 --> 00:55:42.459
SAM: And eat it?

00:55:42.459 --> 00:55:45.129
LIAM: Eat it, after Beauregard eats it.

00:55:45.129 --> 00:55:46.459
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:46.459 --> 00:55:47.952
LIAM: Give it to Beauregard. She'll try anything.

00:55:47.952 --> 00:55:49.626
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. (laughs)

00:55:50.633 --> 00:55:53.341
LIAM: And let's see what we see.

00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:55.621
MARISHA: But I guess just to be clear,

00:55:55.621 --> 00:55:59.640
if there does happen to be a chance where we can murder him,

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.149
should we?

00:56:01.149 --> 00:56:02.751
Or should we just like, table that?

00:56:02.751 --> 00:56:04.653
TRAVIS: I think we're following his lead.

00:56:04.653 --> 00:56:06.602
Caleb's lead, yeah?
MARISHA: Okay.

00:56:06.602 --> 00:56:08.311
TALIESIN: No sudden moves.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:11.748
SAM: And this trip northward to the frigid country,

00:56:11.748 --> 00:56:15.754
is that immediately after dinner, or days later?

00:56:15.754 --> 00:56:17.322
LAURA: It's like a week from now.
LIAM: End of the week.

00:56:17.322 --> 00:56:20.642
SAM: So we don't need to be prepared for like a quick,

00:56:20.642 --> 00:56:22.863
"Thanks for dinner, Trent. Let's get the fuck outta here."

00:56:22.863 --> 00:56:24.692
We don't to do that or anything, right?

00:56:24.692 --> 00:56:26.311
TALIESIN: Only if dinner goes really poorly.

00:56:26.311 --> 00:56:29.371
LAURA: Only if we stay at Trent's place for a week.

00:56:29.371 --> 00:56:31.563
We should get some winter clothes together, you guys.

00:56:31.563 --> 00:56:32.588
MARISHA: Yeah, we should.
TALIESIN: I have nothing.

00:56:32.588 --> 00:56:34.588
LAURA: It's going to be so cold.

00:56:36.628 --> 00:56:38.249
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Top of the world, yeah.

00:56:39.674 --> 00:56:41.982
SAM: Is there shopping here?

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:44.457
LAURA: I mean, yeah, but...

00:56:44.457 --> 00:56:45.898
SAM: But not winter shopping.

00:56:45.898 --> 00:56:46.967
LIAM: No, I think Rexxentrum is better.

00:56:46.967 --> 00:56:48.567
LAURA: We can have anything custom made, yeah,

00:56:48.567 --> 00:56:50.315
but it's colder there.
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah.

00:56:50.315 --> 00:56:51.645
TALIESIN: A little better.
SAM: Okay.

00:56:51.645 --> 00:56:52.836
MATT: (creaking door)

00:56:52.836 --> 00:56:54.519
(as Yeza) "All right, so I think
I've got enough for everybody."

00:56:54.519 --> 00:56:55.854
TRAVIS: Oh, let me take that for you.

00:56:55.854 --> 00:56:57.008
Let me help you.

00:56:57.008 --> 00:56:58.853
LAURA: He's like a Santa Claus!
MARISHA: Oh, you got a six pack!

00:56:58.853 --> 00:57:00.027
Awesome!

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:03.063
SAM: Caduceus, can you help cook a little bit?

00:57:03.063 --> 00:57:05.312
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, let me-- let's--
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, come."

00:57:05.312 --> 00:57:08.244
TALIESIN: Oh, it's really tiny in
here. How do you do-- oh wow.

00:57:08.244 --> 00:57:09.996
LIAM: Oh, wow.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:57:09.996 --> 00:57:11.429
LAURA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

00:57:11.429 --> 00:57:14.198
LAURA: Maybe just get down on your knees, Caduceus.

00:57:14.198 --> 00:57:15.486
TALIESIN: I'm going to just sit.

00:57:15.486 --> 00:57:17.359
I'm just not even-- I'm just going to sit down.

00:57:17.359 --> 00:57:18.731
MATT: "I'll get a stool for you, just--"

00:57:18.731 --> 00:57:20.985
TALIESIN: Oh no, the floor is fine. This is really low.

00:57:20.985 --> 00:57:23.121
MATT: "Okay, no worries. Just help me cut these up

00:57:23.121 --> 00:57:24.938
"and I'll go ahead and get it sautéing, and I've got it.

00:57:24.938 --> 00:57:26.511
"You guys continue, sorry."

00:57:26.784 --> 00:57:29.117
SAM: We rented the halfling apartment,

00:57:29.117 --> 00:57:30.637
but we should have rented a full size one.

00:57:30.637 --> 00:57:32.037
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

00:57:32.037 --> 00:57:33.478
TALIESIN: The rent different is--

00:57:33.478 --> 00:57:35.103
SAM: You know what? Here.

00:57:35.103 --> 00:57:39.370
Yeza, take 500 gold and just get us another place

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:42.107
nearby in case this happens again.

00:57:42.107 --> 00:57:43.363
MATT: "Where are you getting all this money?"

00:57:43.363 --> 00:57:47.289
SAM: Oh, it's crazy. We find money all over the place.

00:57:47.289 --> 00:57:49.578
(laughter)

00:57:49.578 --> 00:57:52.774
SAM: This one, this bunch we found in a volcano!

00:57:52.774 --> 00:57:53.724
LAURA: It's true.

00:57:53.724 --> 00:57:55.577
MATT: "So you weren't joking.
You actually were in a volcano?"

00:57:55.577 --> 00:57:56.476
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:56.476 --> 00:57:58.260
That wasn't a metaphorical volcano.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.327
That was a real volcano.

00:58:00.327 --> 00:58:01.924
MATT: "I thought you were just on, like,

00:58:01.924 --> 00:58:04.259
"an emotional journey with your friends."

00:58:04.259 --> 00:58:06.397
SAM: I mean, it was also cathartic for many other reasons,

00:58:06.397 --> 00:58:09.027
but no, no, this was a literal volcano.

00:58:09.027 --> 00:58:10.717
MATT: "So this tentacled, multi-eyed beast

00:58:10.717 --> 00:58:13.844
"wasn't some sort of projection of your internal--"

00:58:13.844 --> 00:58:16.247
SAM: It wasn't fear of commitment.
MATT: "Actual?"

00:58:16.247 --> 00:58:17.889
SAM: No, it was real, yeah.

00:58:17.889 --> 00:58:19.577
MATT: "That is terrifying."

00:58:19.577 --> 00:58:21.630
Luc's like, "It's so cool!"

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.238
LAURA: It was really cool.
LIAM: It's a hard story to tell

00:58:23.238 --> 00:58:25.071
with Luc around, to be honest.

00:58:25.927 --> 00:58:27.167
MARISHA: It's what? It's a bad story to tell?

00:58:27.167 --> 00:58:29.097
LIAM: It's a hard story to tell,

00:58:29.097 --> 00:58:31.657
as many of the details are maybe not for--

00:58:31.657 --> 00:58:34.508
MARISHA: No, it's the best story to tell with him around.
LAURA: It was a giant, black--

00:58:34.508 --> 00:58:36.710
LIAM: Maybe a couple more years.
LAURA: -- multi-tentacled monster--

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.140
MARISHA: He's going to find out sooner or later, man.
SAM: We'll just skip a couple of--

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.637
LAURA: -- fire coming out of his skin and he breathed fire

00:58:41.637 --> 00:58:44.157
and he had multiple eyes and he sent you these

00:58:44.157 --> 00:58:48.497
mental images of this really scary place.

00:58:48.497 --> 00:58:50.067
MATT: "And did you kill him, Mom?"

00:58:50.067 --> 00:58:51.417
SAM: (scoffs) Duh.

00:58:52.406 --> 00:58:53.266
MATT: "Yes!"

00:58:53.266 --> 00:58:54.407
LAURA: Your mom had the final blow.

00:58:54.407 --> 00:58:56.005
She took him down with one shot.

00:58:56.005 --> 00:58:57.595
LIAM: Murdered him straight up.

00:58:57.595 --> 00:58:58.753
SAM: Did I?

00:58:58.753 --> 00:59:02.136
MATT: Yeza's over in the corner, like, (tapping)

00:59:02.136 --> 00:59:04.847
TRAVIS: Finger, finger, finger.
MATT: "Okay! Okay.

00:59:06.197 --> 00:59:08.670
"I mean that's greatly impressive. Be careful."

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.187
SAM: Of course, of course. Always careful.

00:59:10.187 --> 00:59:12.651
Safety first, right? That's The Mighty Nein motto.

00:59:12.651 --> 00:59:15.727
LAURA: And then we were throwing penises into a volcano,

00:59:15.727 --> 00:59:18.020
in the same volcano, and this god came down.

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.067
SAM: Don't worry. They weren't real penises.

00:59:20.067 --> 00:59:21.663
We made them first.

00:59:21.663 --> 00:59:23.297
MARISHA: They were real penises.
SAM: They were toy penises.

00:59:23.297 --> 00:59:24.997
LAURA: Here!
MATT: "Dad, what's a penis?"

00:59:24.997 --> 00:59:27.812
And Yeza's like, (groans)
LIAM: Oh no!

00:59:28.777 --> 00:59:30.507
TRAVIS: There was a gold one, but it got stuck

00:59:30.507 --> 00:59:32.950
in this woman's hand. It was incredible.

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:34.693
MATT: (as Luc) "What?!"
TRAVIS: For-ev-er.

00:59:34.693 --> 00:59:38.288
MATT: Yeza's like, "Oh, ah-- honey?"

00:59:39.367 --> 00:59:42.137
SAM: Sorry, we'll tone it down a little bit.

00:59:42.137 --> 00:59:43.871
TALIESIN: Going to be the best archenemy.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:59:43.871 --> 00:59:46.094
SAM: But--
MARISHA: Hey, Luc. Luc!

00:59:46.094 --> 00:59:46.927
MATT: (whispering) "What?"

00:59:46.927 --> 00:59:48.397
MARISHA: You want to learn our secret handshake, though,

00:59:48.397 --> 00:59:49.707
from the island?
MATT: "Yeah!"

00:59:49.707 --> 00:59:52.392
MARISHA: Just go: Chaos reign!
MATT: "Chaos reign!"

00:59:52.392 --> 00:59:54.043
Yeza's like, "No no no!"

00:59:54.043 --> 00:59:56.271
MARISHA: You got it, yeah!

00:59:56.271 --> 00:59:58.817
SAM: Here, here, here. Give him a fucking firework,

00:59:58.817 --> 01:00:00.397
take his mind off.
ASHLEY: Wait, here, here, here.

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:02.687
MARISHA: Yeah, let's shoot some
fireworks off from the balcony.

01:00:02.687 --> 01:00:04.088
MATT: "I want a fucking firework!"

01:00:04.088 --> 01:00:05.777
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:00:05.777 --> 01:00:07.917
TRAVIS: We have any more T-Rex? Did anyone bring home

01:00:07.917 --> 01:00:09.767
T-Rex in a pouch or something?

01:00:09.767 --> 01:00:10.987
TALIESIN: I've got some teeth.
ASHLEY: A T-Rex tooth?

01:00:10.987 --> 01:00:12.557
LAURA: Yeah! We all have a tooth!

01:00:12.557 --> 01:00:15.277
MATT: "Hey, Luc, why don't you go play with

01:00:15.277 --> 01:00:18.787
"your friend Vanishing Dog, whatever his name is."

01:00:18.787 --> 01:00:20.895
LAURA: Nugget, his name is Nugget.
MATT: "Nugget.

01:00:20.895 --> 01:00:22.197
"That's the one."

01:00:22.197 --> 01:00:24.950
MARISHA: I slip Luc some bottle rockets.

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.200
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.597
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: He's going to burn the house down.

01:00:28.597 --> 01:00:31.687
LAURA: Oh my god. Please don't bust his hand off.

01:00:31.687 --> 01:00:33.287
LIAM: Does your house have a yard?
LAURA: If he does, though,

01:00:33.287 --> 01:00:35.203
I'll be able to fix it. Don't worry.
LIAM: No?

01:00:35.203 --> 01:00:36.387
MARISHA: 11.

01:00:36.387 --> 01:00:38.669
SAM: There must be a courtyard. It's a condo.

01:00:38.669 --> 01:00:39.810
MATT: So Yeza sees it.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:40.926
TALIESIN: Those Malibu houses.

01:00:40.926 --> 01:00:43.051
SAM: Taliesin, can you tell me,

01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:44.913
what was it like to grow up as Luc?

01:00:44.913 --> 01:00:46.999
(laughter)

01:00:46.999 --> 01:00:50.624
MATT: Yeza walks over and takes the rockets from Luc.

01:00:50.624 --> 01:00:52.457
LAURA and MARISHA: Aww.

01:00:52.457 --> 01:00:54.302
MATT: "When he's old enough."

01:00:54.302 --> 01:00:55.997
LAURA: How old is he? How old is Luc?

01:00:57.137 --> 01:00:57.970
SAM: DM?

01:00:57.970 --> 01:00:59.396
(laughter)

01:00:59.396 --> 01:01:02.026
SAM: At the beginning I felt he was around three or four.

01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:03.487
Now I feel like he's like six or seven.

01:01:03.487 --> 01:01:04.917
MATT: No, he's like four.

01:01:04.917 --> 01:01:06.373
SAM: He's four?!
LAURA: He's four?!

01:01:06.373 --> 01:01:07.681
SAM: Oh my god! But you know,

01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:09.646
halflings are different.
LAURA: I thought he was six or seven!

01:01:09.646 --> 01:01:12.123
SAM: Halflings are different, right?
LIAM: Yeah, they're much older.

01:01:14.122 --> 01:01:15.924
LAURA: He's that little?
MATT: Yeah.

01:01:15.924 --> 01:01:17.588
LAURA: Oh, now I feel really bad.

01:01:17.588 --> 01:01:19.257
TRAVIS: You gave a four-year-old bottle rockets.

01:01:19.257 --> 01:01:21.774
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: You gave a four-year-old a crossbow!

01:01:21.774 --> 01:01:23.227
MARISHA: Perfectly safe toy.

01:01:24.125 --> 01:01:27.247
ASHLEY: Also, your four-year-old
should know what his penis is.

01:01:27.247 --> 01:01:29.024
LAURA: Yeah, a four-year-old should definitely know.

01:01:29.024 --> 01:01:30.290
SAM: We call it a wee-wee.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.452
LAURA: Oh.
ASHLEY: A wee-wee.

01:01:32.452 --> 01:01:33.827
MATT: The term he was unfamiliar with.

01:01:33.827 --> 01:01:34.897
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Got it.

01:01:34.897 --> 01:01:37.147
SAM: We don't use medical terms around him.

01:01:37.147 --> 01:01:39.567
LAURA: You know, my mom believed in medical terms.

01:01:39.567 --> 01:01:40.840
Just put it right out there.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.681
SAM: Really?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:01:41.681 --> 01:01:43.897
That way you never, you know, get confused.

01:01:43.897 --> 01:01:45.303
TRAVIS: Put the penis right out there?

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.053
LAURA: Just the word.

01:01:47.053 --> 01:01:48.251
MATT: "Dinner's ready!"

01:01:48.251 --> 01:01:51.917
(laughter)

01:01:52.794 --> 01:01:53.693
MATT: All right.

01:01:53.693 --> 01:01:55.336
LAURA: (laughing) Three or four?!

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:58.320
SAM: Well, I was confused!

01:01:59.347 --> 01:02:01.122
He acts-- he's very precocious.

01:02:01.122 --> 01:02:03.130
He reads at a sixth grade--

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.530
a six-year-old level, I mean.

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:05.546
LAURA: Oh yeah, well.

01:02:05.546 --> 01:02:09.148
TRAVIS: Sixth grade level? Holy shit, he's brilliant.

01:02:09.148 --> 01:02:11.481
(laughter)

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:16.097
MATT: So.

01:02:16.097 --> 01:02:19.267
You enjoy a fine meal, cooked by the team of

01:02:19.267 --> 01:02:21.130
Yeza and Caduceus.

01:02:21.967 --> 01:02:24.087
Catch up a bit more on the stories about

01:02:24.087 --> 01:02:27.680
your all perspectives on the experience, Rumblecusp.

01:02:28.677 --> 01:02:30.327
And you're able to speak on whatever,

01:02:30.327 --> 01:02:33.817
as much as you'd like to about your future plans, if at all.

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:38.437
But nevertheless evening grows dark, the sun sets.

01:02:38.437 --> 01:02:40.917
Is there anything you wish to accomplish for the night

01:02:40.917 --> 01:02:42.618
here in Nicodranas?

01:02:42.618 --> 01:02:45.157
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a walk to the lighthouse.

01:02:45.157 --> 01:02:46.140
LAURA: Oh.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.223
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:53.157
After the meal is done, and it is a nice filling meal,

01:02:53.157 --> 01:02:55.117
some of you rest to digest for a bit

01:02:55.117 --> 01:02:58.997
and, you know, watch Luc begin to act out

01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:02.964
his interpretations of the things that his mother did.

01:03:02.964 --> 01:03:05.097
He starts taking his--

01:03:05.097 --> 01:03:08.448
still slightly dangerous for a child his age, crossbow--

01:03:08.448 --> 01:03:10.897
(laughter)

01:03:10.897 --> 01:03:12.377
ASHLEY: Four-year-old.
SAM: Got to learn some time.

01:03:12.377 --> 01:03:13.507
MATT: Yep.

01:03:13.507 --> 01:03:15.267
While Caduceus, you make your way out

01:03:15.267 --> 01:03:18.857
along the sand-scraped cobblestones

01:03:18.857 --> 01:03:20.823
of the Opal Archways,

01:03:20.823 --> 01:03:24.306
passing down towards the harbor.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:28.679
Drawn towards the image of the large

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:32.207
lighthouse of the Wild Mother.

01:03:32.207 --> 01:03:36.697
You can see the gradual shifting of the beam across the

01:03:36.697 --> 01:03:38.887
cloudless starry night sky.

01:03:38.887 --> 01:03:42.477
You can hear the sound of waves crashing against the

01:03:43.377 --> 01:03:44.950
rocks and beach.

01:03:45.817 --> 01:03:49.117
You can hear the occasional whistles and bells from ships

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.617
that are coming into and going back out to harbor.

01:03:56.609 --> 01:03:57.867
TALIESIN: This is perfect.

01:04:00.157 --> 01:04:01.807
I'm going to cast Word of Recall.

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:04.337
MATT: Okay.

01:04:04.337 --> 01:04:05.645
SAM: (whispering) What does that do?

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.947
I guess it recalls something?

01:04:08.947 --> 01:04:10.657
LIAM: Didn't you see Total Recall?

01:04:10.657 --> 01:04:12.197
TALIESIN: Total Recall.

01:04:12.197 --> 01:04:13.351
SAM: Word of Total Recall.

01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:14.184
LAURA: Wait.

01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:17.387
TALIESIN: You have to do it in a--

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:19.137
You get the little temple, I don't.

01:04:20.447 --> 01:04:23.734
MATT: All right. So.
SAM: Are you leaving the party?

01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:25.497
MATT: Explain how you cast the spell.

01:04:29.227 --> 01:04:30.385
TALIESIN: Take in the lighthouse,

01:04:30.385 --> 01:04:34.397
and I reach into my bag for

01:04:34.397 --> 01:04:38.817
some of the mushrooms and fruit and dirt

01:04:38.817 --> 01:04:43.039
that I keep from home that my tea comes from,

01:04:43.039 --> 01:04:47.838
and I just slowly drop it

01:04:47.838 --> 01:04:49.179
at the edge of the lighthouse

01:04:49.179 --> 01:04:51.397
as I walk around it as much as I can.

01:04:51.397 --> 01:04:56.397
And let it start to take root.

01:04:57.047 --> 01:04:59.347
and use the Decompose to just let it

01:05:00.257 --> 01:05:05.257
begin to grow at its accelerated rate.

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:06.381
MATT: Okay.

01:05:06.381 --> 01:05:08.067
TALIESIN: Connect it to my temple.

01:05:08.067 --> 01:05:12.227
MATT: Okay. As you finish your pass around,

01:05:12.227 --> 01:05:16.027
which the lighthouse is on the edge of the cliff.

01:05:16.027 --> 01:05:18.887
So there are a few precarious edges that you toss

01:05:18.887 --> 01:05:20.927
and let the wind do the rest for you.

01:05:20.927 --> 01:05:23.637
And as you do, you toss a bit of

01:05:23.637 --> 01:05:27.127
this mulch, if you will, into the wind

01:05:27.127 --> 01:05:29.037
and watch as a breeze

01:05:29.037 --> 01:05:30.447
blows it back in to the lighthouse,

01:05:30.447 --> 01:05:33.207
and it slides down into the bits of cliff edge,

01:05:33.207 --> 01:05:35.457
dirt, sea grass that are

01:05:36.687 --> 01:05:38.440
barely cusping off the edge.

01:05:39.467 --> 01:05:42.427
And as you return back to the point

01:05:42.427 --> 01:05:44.887
where you had begun this, you can already see

01:05:46.007 --> 01:05:49.650
small peaking caps beginning to make their way through.

01:05:50.567 --> 01:05:55.337
As you finish concentrating, close your eyes, taking a deep

01:05:55.337 --> 01:05:58.167
breath and muttering your prayer to the Wild Mother,

01:05:58.167 --> 01:06:02.647
with your eyes closed, the lightless expanse around you.

01:06:02.647 --> 01:06:07.027
Through your eyelids, you see a faint, warm

01:06:07.027 --> 01:06:11.240
pale white-green glow in the shape of the lighthouse itself,

01:06:12.387 --> 01:06:14.580
pierce into your mind's eye.

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:17.197
And as you slowly open your eyes,

01:06:17.197 --> 01:06:20.877
that glow remains hanging for but a second longer.

01:06:20.877 --> 01:06:24.557
It's like the lighthouse itself

01:06:24.557 --> 01:06:26.447
is emitting light as a central beacon,

01:06:26.447 --> 01:06:29.135
as opposed to the actual beam.

01:06:29.135 --> 01:06:31.177
As that fades, you look down

01:06:31.177 --> 01:06:32.807
and the mushrooms are now fully grown

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:36.827
as if weeks had passed in a matter of moments.

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:40.077
And you feel a a deep, anchored

01:06:40.077 --> 01:06:42.030
connection to this lighthouse.

01:06:45.157 --> 01:06:48.044
TALIESIN: With a little luck, we won't need this, but...

01:06:51.634 --> 01:06:54.517
we'll try to deal with what you've put in front of us.

01:06:56.437 --> 01:06:57.270
Thank you.

01:06:58.559 --> 01:07:03.067
I'll take the slow walk back to the Chateau, so.

01:07:03.067 --> 01:07:04.697
MATT: Okay.

01:07:04.697 --> 01:07:07.640
LAURA: I'm going to walk back to the Lavish Chateau.

01:07:09.337 --> 01:07:12.687
Actually, are we all going back there to sleep tonight?

01:07:12.687 --> 01:07:14.190
LIAM: You said you were putting us up there, yeah.

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:16.927
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. I'll
do this when we get back, then.

01:07:16.927 --> 01:07:20.127
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: But I will step away for a moment

01:07:20.127 --> 01:07:23.837
and I'm going to just-- is there a balcony here?

01:07:23.837 --> 01:07:26.842
Is there somewhere where I can be a little private?

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:27.675
Veth?

01:07:27.675 --> 01:07:29.417
SAM: Oh yeah, sure. There's a little courtyard

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:32.197
and there's a roof, there's a rooftop deck.

01:07:32.197 --> 01:07:34.467
LAURA: Really?
SAM: Well, it came with the HOA.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:36.997
LAURA: Wow. I'm going to go up to the rooftop deck.

01:07:36.997 --> 01:07:39.355
MATT: Okay. (giggles)

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:42.397
LAURA: I'm going to sit down and I'm going to cast Scry

01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:46.570
on Lord Robert Sharpe.

01:07:47.787 --> 01:07:50.420
MATT: All right.
LAURA: And see what the fuck he's doing.

01:07:52.617 --> 01:07:56.577
MATT: Okay. You sit there for a second.

01:07:56.577 --> 01:07:57.987
Looking over, from this perspective,

01:07:57.987 --> 01:08:00.077
it's a beautiful view of the Archways

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:02.027
of the buildings of similar height.

01:08:02.027 --> 01:08:04.707
And you can see, because the Archways exists

01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:06.437
a little bit on a higher hill than a lot of

01:08:06.437 --> 01:08:08.277
the rest of the city, which descends around

01:08:08.277 --> 01:08:10.277
before it gets to the edge of the cliff side.

01:08:10.277 --> 01:08:14.399
So from this rooftop view at night, it's this beautiful

01:08:14.399 --> 01:08:17.537
landscape of hundreds and hundreds of lantern lights,

01:08:17.537 --> 01:08:21.120
different colors, of different colored glass, and lanterns.

01:08:22.357 --> 01:08:23.677
So it's this beautiful view.

01:08:23.677 --> 01:08:27.617
And as you sit, the still somewhat warm

01:08:27.617 --> 01:08:32.447
ocean air coming in, close your eyes and concentrate.

01:08:32.447 --> 01:08:37.447
In that moment, you sense
across from you, hands taking yours

01:08:37.517 --> 01:08:39.450
and a voice, a familiar voice goes,

01:08:40.622 --> 01:08:44.414
"So you want to go peek in on that disgusting being."

01:08:44.414 --> 01:08:47.967
LAURA: I just want to make sure that, you know,

01:08:47.967 --> 01:08:49.086
I'm not going to get in trouble for

01:08:49.086 --> 01:08:51.231
what we pulled at the party.

01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:52.434
MATT: "Let's go have a look, shall we?"

01:08:52.434 --> 01:08:53.932
LAURA: Okay!

01:08:53.932 --> 01:08:57.357
MATT: As you close your eyes, you feel your

01:08:57.357 --> 01:09:00.627
consciousness extend a bit, like

01:09:00.627 --> 01:09:02.807
the Traveler is taking your hand and pulling

01:09:02.807 --> 01:09:05.217
your spirit from your body for about a moment.

01:09:05.217 --> 01:09:09.557
In that passage, you bring yourself immediately to

01:09:09.557 --> 01:09:13.107
the exterior of a beautiful mansion, this estate

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:17.507
that exists on the northeastern side of Nicodranas.

01:09:17.507 --> 01:09:22.177
And there, suddenly, you see him sitting in some sort of a

01:09:22.177 --> 01:09:24.747
dark red leather study, books everywhere.

01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:29.607
He's in a long loose silk robe over just some

01:09:29.607 --> 01:09:31.907
comfortable, expensive clothing.

01:09:31.907 --> 01:09:34.827
And it looks like he's in the process of reading

01:09:34.827 --> 01:09:36.902
just casually.

01:09:36.902 --> 01:09:38.887
LAURA: What is he reading? Can I see?

01:09:38.887 --> 01:09:40.187
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:09:44.497 --> 01:09:47.019
TRAVIS: Oh, which one will it be?

01:09:47.019 --> 01:09:50.017
SAM: Got to pick a good one.

01:09:50.017 --> 01:09:50.957
LAURA: 13.

01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:53.807
MATT: 13? Can't quite make out the details,

01:09:53.807 --> 01:09:56.187
but you can get a good view of him.

01:09:56.187 --> 01:10:01.180
He looks like he hasn't been sleeping well,

01:10:02.227 --> 01:10:04.553
but not much else you really pick up on him.

01:10:04.553 --> 01:10:06.782
LAURA: Is there anybody there with him?

01:10:06.782 --> 01:10:07.927
MATT: Not from what you can tell,

01:10:07.927 --> 01:10:12.500
since the focus of this particular scrying beacon is him.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.277
You can just make out some of
the colors in the room around him

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.797
and the furniture he's immediately on,

01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:21.267
which is a lounging couch, dark red leather.

01:10:21.267 --> 01:10:22.933
That's about it.
LAURA: Okay.

01:10:22.933 --> 01:10:25.117
MATT: So he's not currently at the moment hunting you down,

01:10:25.117 --> 01:10:26.136
if that's what you were worried about.

01:10:26.136 --> 01:10:29.440
LAURA: No, no, no. You know, just... all right.

01:10:31.157 --> 01:10:33.030
SAM: The book is called, "How to Kill Jester."

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:34.260
LAURA: I know, right?

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.802
MATT: (laughs)

01:10:35.802 --> 01:10:39.310
TRAVIS: So You Got Caught Out
On The Balcony With Your Wang Out.

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:41.645
MATT: Second edition.

01:10:41.645 --> 01:10:43.978
(laughter)

01:10:46.707 --> 01:10:50.512
LAURA: Okay. I guess I'll stop scrying then.

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:54.347
MATT: Mmkay. As you return, the voice of the Traveler

01:10:54.347 --> 01:10:55.597
echoes through your mind.

01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:58.417
"Well. At least we didn't catch him

01:10:58.417 --> 01:11:00.277
"with his wang in his hand."

01:11:00.277 --> 01:11:01.174
LAURA: That would have been better, though.

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:04.334
MATT: "Mmm... some things even I don't want to see."

01:11:05.697 --> 01:11:07.677
And then as you open your eyes again,

01:11:07.677 --> 01:11:10.837
you briefly think you see the flutter of a cloak,

01:11:10.837 --> 01:11:14.147
but it's just a leaf drifting by in the wind,

01:11:14.147 --> 01:11:15.937
but there's no trees immediately nearby.

01:11:15.937 --> 01:11:18.237
So the source of the leaf is a little strange.

01:11:20.472 --> 01:11:21.472
LAURA: I go back inside.

01:11:21.472 --> 01:11:25.190
MATT: Okay. Any other business before the night is done?

01:11:29.427 --> 01:11:30.267
SAM: Negative.

01:11:30.267 --> 01:11:33.327
LIAM: I think when we all get back to the Chateau,

01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:36.357
and we're laughing and had a good time over dinner

01:11:36.357 --> 01:11:38.570
and it's all winding down, I say: Hey,

01:11:39.827 --> 01:11:43.967
you have talked so much about your time as a child

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:46.627
with your fey friend here and all the time

01:11:46.627 --> 01:11:47.477
you were trapped in your room.

01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:50.957
Would you show us your room? I'm so curious.

01:11:50.957 --> 01:11:53.157
We've been in this building so many times and I've always

01:11:53.157 --> 01:11:55.930
wondered what your childhood bedroom looked like.

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:57.842
LAURA: You guys want to see my room?

01:11:57.842 --> 01:11:58.800
MARISHA: I feel like--
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.037
MARISHA: I think I saw it when you dressed me up

01:12:01.037 --> 01:12:05.194
in your dress one time, but I-- it's a sight to behold.

01:12:05.194 --> 01:12:08.487
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on up!
I'll go up and show them.

01:12:08.487 --> 01:12:11.927
Good! I needed to go to my room anyway, so this is perfect.

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:14.077
MATT: Okay. Jester leads you up to the chamber

01:12:14.077 --> 01:12:15.937
where she spent the majority of her life,

01:12:15.937 --> 01:12:18.157
and you may describe it to them as you see fit.

01:12:18.157 --> 01:12:22.077
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Um.

01:12:22.077 --> 01:12:26.397
There's a very, ornate little bed in the room.

01:12:26.397 --> 01:12:28.707
Lots of ruffles. It's like a, you know,

01:12:28.707 --> 01:12:32.430
four-post bed, sort of. There's a canopy, you know.

01:12:34.327 --> 01:12:37.575
There's lots of little trinkets everywhere.

01:12:37.575 --> 01:12:42.407
Little sculptures, some are shitty, some are pretty good.

01:12:42.407 --> 01:12:44.080
Lots of books.

01:12:45.507 --> 01:12:47.197
And all over the walls,

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:49.877
starting at the bottom with really

01:12:49.877 --> 01:12:53.787
not very good drawings, it just covers up.

01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:56.137
The higher you go, the better the drawings get.

01:12:57.867 --> 01:13:00.692
ASHLEY: As you got taller, you got better.

01:13:00.692 --> 01:13:02.950
LAURA: You know, I think talent comes with height.

01:13:04.287 --> 01:13:07.607
ASHLEY: Probably. I must be extremely talented then.

01:13:07.607 --> 01:13:09.099
LAURA: You are, Yasha.

01:13:09.099 --> 01:13:10.647
LIAM: You're a big reader?

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:12.697
LAURA: Oh, well, yeah. What else are
you going to do when you're,

01:13:12.697 --> 01:13:15.220
you know, hanging out in here?

01:13:16.387 --> 01:13:18.767
Plus, I had a lot of tutors, you know.

01:13:18.767 --> 01:13:22.557
My mom always said it's very important to be educated.

01:13:22.557 --> 01:13:25.457
So you can be a good conversationalist.

01:13:25.457 --> 01:13:27.467
LIAM: Wise woman.
LAURA: Yes.

01:13:27.467 --> 01:13:29.927
TRAVIS: There are a lot of windows in this room.

01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:32.747
LAURA: Yeah. It's fun to look out. Isn't it?

01:13:32.747 --> 01:13:35.437
LIAM: How many times have you climbed out that window?

01:13:35.437 --> 01:13:37.387
LAURA: (giggles) Um...

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:42.837
Quite a few. But I was actually pretty good about

01:13:42.837 --> 01:13:44.497
staying in for a very long time.

01:13:44.497 --> 01:13:46.267
It wasn't until after the Traveler, really,

01:13:46.267 --> 01:13:50.130
that I started sneaking out a little bit more.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.581
What do you think?

01:13:55.581 --> 01:13:57.890
LIAM: Better than I imagined, you were not lying.

01:14:00.497 --> 01:14:02.580
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh! Lay down on the bed!

01:14:04.219 --> 01:14:05.513
It's okay. It's okay. Just lay down.

01:14:05.513 --> 01:14:07.144
TRAVIS: Just lay down in the bed, Caleb.

01:14:07.144 --> 01:14:10.427
LIAM: I... it's a little small for me, but okay.

01:14:10.427 --> 01:14:13.597
LAURA: If you lay down in the bed, up on top of the canopy,

01:14:13.597 --> 01:14:17.227
I've painted the beautiful landscape of the Nicodranas

01:14:17.227 --> 01:14:20.087
sea line with the lighthouse and everything

01:14:20.087 --> 01:14:22.497
so you can see it looking out.

01:14:22.497 --> 01:14:25.257
It's like you're looking out the window,

01:14:25.257 --> 01:14:26.808
but it's above you!

01:14:27.971 --> 01:14:30.138
MATT: (tapping)

01:14:31.055 --> 01:14:32.597
(panting)

01:14:32.597 --> 01:14:35.649
You watch as Nugget leaps up onto
the bed as well and is like

01:14:35.649 --> 01:14:37.644
(panting)

01:14:37.644 --> 01:14:40.807
LIAM: I'm really more of a cat person, but okay.

01:14:40.807 --> 01:14:43.054
MATT: And just pees in the bed.

01:14:43.054 --> 01:14:44.979
LAURA: No, Nugget!

01:14:44.979 --> 01:14:47.137
LIAM: Now <i>this</i> I am familiar with.

01:14:47.137 --> 01:14:50.387
LAURA: Nugget, get down. Oh, what is happening?

01:14:50.387 --> 01:14:54.157
You really should learn, Nugget. Don't pee in the bed.

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:56.302
MATT: Is just gone.

01:14:56.302 --> 01:14:58.972
LIAM: Smells like old times.

01:14:58.972 --> 01:15:00.347
LAURA: I was going to sleep here tonight,

01:15:00.347 --> 01:15:01.767
now I can't sleep in this bed.

01:15:01.767 --> 01:15:03.767
MARISHA: We can help you change the sheets real quick.

01:15:03.767 --> 01:15:07.550
LAURA: Ugh, it's probably gone through to the mattress.

01:15:08.507 --> 01:15:10.107
I'm going to have to buy a new mattress.

01:15:10.107 --> 01:15:13.077
MARISHA: Caduceus, magic it away.
TALIESIN: How?

01:15:13.077 --> 01:15:13.950
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.688
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast.

01:15:16.688 --> 01:15:17.809
(laughter)

01:15:17.809 --> 01:15:21.597
MATT and LIAM: (explosion)

01:15:21.597 --> 01:15:23.197
LIAM: Blackened feathers everywhere.

01:15:24.217 --> 01:15:28.380
TALIESIN: I wave my hands and the windows
all suddenly snap closed.

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.497
(crashing)

01:15:30.497 --> 01:15:32.643
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, that works.

01:15:32.643 --> 01:15:34.228
TALIESIN: I don't know what else to tell you.

01:15:34.228 --> 01:15:35.947
LAURA: Keep them open, it's a very strong smell.

01:15:35.947 --> 01:15:37.097
TALIESIN: I make them all open.

01:15:39.427 --> 01:15:44.427
LAURA: But while we're here, I am going to also cast

01:15:44.557 --> 01:15:48.367
Word of Recall here in this room.

01:15:48.367 --> 01:15:49.200
MATT: Okay.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.307
LAURA: This is, if there ever would be a temple

01:15:51.307 --> 01:15:53.877
to the Traveler, this is it.

01:15:53.877 --> 01:15:57.557
Since I've painted many drawings of him and other things

01:15:57.557 --> 01:16:00.017
that remind me of him all through the room.

01:16:00.017 --> 01:16:02.044
MATT: Okay. As you guys are here, taking in the space,

01:16:02.044 --> 01:16:04.527
you watch as Jester smiles and closes her eyes

01:16:04.527 --> 01:16:07.287
and begins muttering this quiet...

01:16:08.257 --> 01:16:10.857
as much of a prayer to the Traveler as there can be.

01:16:11.907 --> 01:16:12.994
It's more of just a bunch of like,

01:16:12.994 --> 01:16:15.347
"Hey, you're pretty cool."

01:16:15.347 --> 01:16:17.277
LAURA: This is going to be, like, a cool temple

01:16:17.277 --> 01:16:18.768
that people come to.

01:16:18.768 --> 01:16:22.467
TALIESIN: It sounds like Doo Wah Diddy, I don't know.

01:16:22.467 --> 01:16:24.937
MATT: As she begins to mutter this, it's interesting.

01:16:24.937 --> 01:16:27.977
The room is lit by three separate lanterns

01:16:27.977 --> 01:16:30.337
that give this warm interior glow.

01:16:30.337 --> 01:16:33.507
You watch as they all slowly grow dimmer and dimmer.

01:16:33.507 --> 01:16:37.997
And as they do, certain drawings in the surrounding chamber

01:16:37.997 --> 01:16:40.097
begin to get brighter and brighter.

01:16:40.097 --> 01:16:43.497
You can see numerous dots of green and you can now see

01:16:43.497 --> 01:16:46.547
clearly what was mostly hidden amongst this

01:16:46.547 --> 01:16:51.427
scattering tapestry of sketches throughout her lifetime,

01:16:51.427 --> 01:16:53.827
how many various interpretations of the Traveler

01:16:53.827 --> 01:16:55.897
are hidden throughout this room.

01:16:55.897 --> 01:16:57.487
And now all of them, one by one are all

01:16:57.487 --> 01:17:00.887
giving off this faint green glow

01:17:00.887 --> 01:17:05.657
until eventually the lanterns are nearly extinguished

01:17:05.657 --> 01:17:09.120
and you can see dozens and dozens of these vibrant,

01:17:10.297 --> 01:17:14.337
alighting your faces with the volume of light

01:17:14.337 --> 01:17:17.969
that's coming from this in a green hue, before

01:17:17.969 --> 01:17:19.887
(whooshing) all the lanterns brighten up once again

01:17:19.887 --> 01:17:23.227
and you shake your head, and the color passes.

01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:25.307
And you are now linked to this as a sanctuary

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.707
for Word of Recall.

01:17:26.707 --> 01:17:28.600
LAURA: Great! Did you also do it?

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.187
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that was my walk earlier.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:31.917
I've got everything.

01:17:31.917 --> 01:17:33.690
MARISHA: What did, what did you all do?

01:17:35.047 --> 01:17:38.237
LAURA: Well, if ever we're in a horrible situation

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.444
that Caleb maybe can't get us out of,

01:17:41.444 --> 01:17:45.566
Caduceus and I will be able to
get us back to Nicodranas in a flash.

01:17:45.566 --> 01:17:48.918
TALIESIN: We'll need both of us for everybody, but.

01:17:48.918 --> 01:17:49.751
LAURA: Yeah.

01:17:49.751 --> 01:17:52.600
LIAM: There's always one of us unconscious, so.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.567
TRAVIS: Mm, mm-hmm.

01:17:56.177 --> 01:17:57.569
MARISHA: All right.

01:17:57.569 --> 01:17:59.674
ASHLEY: It just bamfs us back here?

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:01.872
TALIESIN: Yep.
ASHLEY: Wow, that's cool!

01:18:02.737 --> 01:18:03.570
LAURA: Yeah.

01:18:03.570 --> 01:18:05.357
TALIESIN: Technically, I'll take us a few blocks away.

01:18:05.357 --> 01:18:07.800
LAURA: Technically, he will!
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.567
LIAM: Is it very taxing on you to do?

01:18:11.567 --> 01:18:15.677
LAURA: Well, it's almost the top of my skill set,

01:18:15.677 --> 01:18:18.112
but not quite, if you know what I mean.

01:18:18.112 --> 01:18:20.809
(laughter)

01:18:20.809 --> 01:18:21.675
SAM: Oh boy.

01:18:21.675 --> 01:18:24.045
LIAM: At face value, I think so?

01:18:24.045 --> 01:18:26.596
(laughter)

01:18:26.596 --> 01:18:29.737
TRAVIS: Oof.
(laughter)

01:18:29.737 --> 01:18:32.157
TALIESIN: It's not the worst thing, but it's...

01:18:33.397 --> 01:18:35.167
if we've had a real rough time, then hopefully

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:36.977
we still have the energy for it.

01:18:36.977 --> 01:18:38.260
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Excellent.

01:18:39.677 --> 01:18:43.217
Two clerics. Not every group of adventurers

01:18:43.217 --> 01:18:45.103
is lucky enough to have two clerics.

01:18:45.103 --> 01:18:45.936
LAURA: Yep.

01:18:45.936 --> 01:18:47.962
LIAM: Right, Matthew?
LAURA: Some don't even have one.

01:18:47.962 --> 01:18:49.240
MATT: Indeed.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.073
TALIESIN: Foolish people.

01:18:50.073 --> 01:18:51.785
MATT: You almost have more than one healer.

01:18:52.693 --> 01:18:55.492
(groaning)
LAURA: (cackles)

01:18:55.492 --> 01:18:58.127
Oh yeah.

01:18:58.127 --> 01:18:59.011
TALIESIN: That's rough, buddy.

01:18:59.011 --> 01:19:02.297
LIAM: I mean, to be fair, Caduceus is like 1.3 healers.

01:19:02.297 --> 01:19:04.772
TALIESIN: That's true.
LIAM: And Jester's like 0.4.

01:19:04.772 --> 01:19:06.697
So that's a lot of healing.

01:19:06.697 --> 01:19:07.737
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: It's pretty good.

01:19:07.737 --> 01:19:10.493
MATT: If you're rounding up, then yeah,
you have two healers.

01:19:10.493 --> 01:19:15.149
TALIESIN: It's like the low-fat milk of healers. It's 98%.

01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:17.939
LAURA: But, you guys, look at my pretty dress I painted.

01:19:17.939 --> 01:19:21.787
(laughter)

01:19:21.787 --> 01:19:23.713
MATT: Different skills. It's fine.

01:19:23.713 --> 01:19:25.337
LIAM: Clerlock?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:19:25.337 --> 01:19:26.628
MATT: All right.

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:27.819
Is there anything else you wish to accomplish

01:19:27.819 --> 01:19:31.237
for the evening or shall we bring you to the next morning?

01:19:32.993 --> 01:19:34.325
TRAVIS: Next morning.

01:19:34.325 --> 01:19:35.460
MARISHA: Next morning!

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:36.293
MATT: Okay.

01:19:36.293 --> 01:19:37.985
LIAM: Caleb will... so quick.

01:19:37.985 --> 01:19:40.957
Caleb will take out the smaller book

01:19:40.957 --> 01:19:43.867
and spend 15 minutes writing.

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:44.987
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's all.

01:19:44.987 --> 01:19:49.197
MATT: Cool. All right. You eventually head off to your

01:19:49.197 --> 01:19:51.697
various chambers throughout the Chateau

01:19:51.697 --> 01:19:53.597
and find yourselves getting a good night's sleep

01:19:53.597 --> 01:19:54.797
in a comfortable bed.

01:19:54.797 --> 01:19:58.247
LAURA: Oh, I snuggle up with Mama
since my bed smells like piss.

01:19:58.247 --> 01:20:00.650
MATT: She doesn't argue.

01:20:02.037 --> 01:20:05.687
An early morning wakes you all, as you didn't,

01:20:05.687 --> 01:20:08.707
especially after your odd sleep schedule in Rumblecusp,

01:20:08.707 --> 01:20:11.487
getting yourselves back on a decent schedule.

01:20:11.487 --> 01:20:14.487
You go to bed a little early, wake up a little early.

01:20:14.487 --> 01:20:16.900
At like 7:00, 7:30. Shortly after dawn.

01:20:17.744 --> 01:20:22.572
The morning greets you. You all gather downstairs and a

01:20:22.572 --> 01:20:26.907
morning meal has already been prepared for all of you,

01:20:26.907 --> 01:20:28.665
courtesy of the Chateau itself.

01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:30.661
What would you like to do?

01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:31.805
LAURA: It's great here. Isn't it?

01:20:31.805 --> 01:20:35.177
MARISHA: The breakfast buffet
cannot be beaten. It's so good.

01:20:35.177 --> 01:20:38.107
ASHLEY: This is... A buffet. I can't even.

01:20:38.107 --> 01:20:41.097
You can have anything you want.

01:20:41.097 --> 01:20:42.667
LAURA: And as much as you want!

01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:44.277
ASHLEY: Yeah. It's not like you just get one thing,

01:20:44.277 --> 01:20:45.967
you have every choice.

01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:47.187
TALIESIN: Plates are so small, though.

01:20:47.187 --> 01:20:48.867
I don't know how any of you deal with this.

01:20:48.867 --> 01:20:51.322
ASHLEY: I've went back seven times already.

01:20:51.322 --> 01:20:52.596
TALIESIN: Could I bring my
own plate next time?

01:20:52.596 --> 01:20:54.100
Is that okay?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Feel free.

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.125
LIAM: Bottomless French toast is amazing.
ASHLEY: BYO Plate? P?

01:20:58.325 --> 01:21:00.373
Bring your own plate?

01:21:00.373 --> 01:21:02.316
MARISHA: BYOP.

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:07.257
LIAM: But so much asparagus.
Is that, like, a Nicodranas thing?

01:21:07.257 --> 01:21:08.717
TALIESIN: It grows very well. It's hard to kill

01:21:08.717 --> 01:21:09.935
once you got it going.

01:21:09.935 --> 01:21:12.067
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: It's true.

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:15.577
MARISHA: I swipe some bacon, put it in my pocket for later.

01:21:15.577 --> 01:21:16.410
MATT: Okay.

01:21:17.329 --> 01:21:20.437
Veth, you can smell the breakfast this early

01:21:20.437 --> 01:21:21.870
in the morning being cooked across the way.

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.267
SAM: Come over for breakfast. So what's going on?

01:21:24.267 --> 01:21:25.100
We going or what?

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:28.287
LAURA: Yeah. Are Luc and Yussa with you?

01:21:28.287 --> 01:21:29.337
SAM: Yep, they're coming with us.

01:21:29.337 --> 01:21:30.677
LAURA: I don't mean that, but

01:21:30.677 --> 01:21:33.257
they can have some of the free breakfast.

01:21:33.257 --> 01:21:36.077
SAM: They can take-- I mean, we have food.

01:21:36.077 --> 01:21:37.787
LAURA: Yeah, I know. But this breakfast is, like,

01:21:37.787 --> 01:21:39.614
it's like going to the Four Seasons for a free breakfast.

01:21:39.614 --> 01:21:41.752
SAM: They eat here every other day!

01:21:41.752 --> 01:21:43.797
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:21:43.797 --> 01:21:46.527
SAM: They are sick of it.

01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:49.747
Did you try the bottomless french toast, by the way?

01:21:49.747 --> 01:21:51.386
ASHLEY: I just get up and walk over.

01:21:51.386 --> 01:21:55.069
(laughter)

01:21:56.854 --> 01:21:58.154
SAM: Get some powdered sugar!

01:21:59.767 --> 01:22:03.780
LIAM: Yasha just undoes her
big gnarly belt just, like, one notch.

01:22:05.503 --> 01:22:06.858
LAURA: Woo!

01:22:06.858 --> 01:22:08.920
ASHLEY: I just take it off.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.783
MATT: Everyone's ready for a--
(strained) whole day of adventuring.

01:22:12.737 --> 01:22:14.423
Getting the pancake sweats.

01:22:14.423 --> 01:22:16.648
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: I'm going to

01:22:16.648 --> 01:22:20.931
just fill my haversack with a lot of
pastries, because it's been awhile.

01:22:20.931 --> 01:22:22.937
MATT: Yeah. Easy enough to do, and there are plenty here.

01:22:22.937 --> 01:22:26.341
So you can write down in your inventory, number of pastries.

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:27.207
LAURA: Okay.

01:22:27.207 --> 01:22:28.947
TALIESIN: A cornucopia of baked goods.
SAM: I will take some as well.

01:22:28.947 --> 01:22:32.197
LIAM: Veth, here's a question for you.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:36.097
We are going to be in Rexxentrum for the week.

01:22:36.097 --> 01:22:38.032
We have a lot of time there and

01:22:38.032 --> 01:22:39.587
we've been away from your family for so long.

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:43.307
Would you like to bring them with? To Rexxentrum?

01:22:43.307 --> 01:22:44.867
SAM: Is it safe?

01:22:44.867 --> 01:22:46.567
LAURA: Well, we're going to see my dad.

01:22:47.967 --> 01:22:49.175
SAM: Wait, what?

01:22:49.175 --> 01:22:50.951
Your dad is in Rexxentrum?
LIAM: Well, we won't bring them to that,

01:22:50.951 --> 01:22:54.967
but I have a perfect place for us to stay while we're there

01:22:54.967 --> 01:22:57.807
and they could-- they'd be very comfortable.

01:22:57.807 --> 01:23:00.197
SAM: Do we have a place? Do you have a place to stay there?

01:23:00.197 --> 01:23:04.817
LIAM: Yeah. There's an inn that I am
intimately familiar with.

01:23:04.817 --> 01:23:06.985
MARISHA: The Gentleman? The Gentleman's in Rex-- what?

01:23:06.985 --> 01:23:09.947
LAURA: No, The Gentleman's in Zadash, can we go there?

01:23:09.947 --> 01:23:10.887
SAM: Wait, what's going on?

01:23:10.887 --> 01:23:12.495
TALIESIN: I would not say no to that at some point.

01:23:12.495 --> 01:23:14.927
SAM: Are we going to have dinner with the enemy tonight?

01:23:14.927 --> 01:23:16.856
LAURA: You're right. Yes, that's happening tonight.

01:23:16.856 --> 01:23:19.691
LIAM: Zadash and Pumat will have to wait.
LAURA: I mean after dinner. If we survive.

01:23:19.691 --> 01:23:21.622
I want to go see my dad.

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:23.829
SAM: If I can keep them close, then yeah.

01:23:23.829 --> 01:23:25.154
TRAVIS: (impacts)

01:23:25.154 --> 01:23:25.987
LAURA: Sorry, guys.

01:23:25.987 --> 01:23:30.030
LIAM: Actually, I am familiar with lodging in both

01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:33.473
Zadash and Rexxentrum that could house all of us.

01:23:33.473 --> 01:23:34.306
SAM: Okay.

01:23:35.305 --> 01:23:36.350
Yeah!
LIAM: It's just,

01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:37.183
you've had so little time.

01:23:37.183 --> 01:23:39.047
SAM: I had one day. Yes, no, it would be great

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:43.017
to keep them around. They can have a little jaunt.

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:46.357
LIAM: Is everybody-- I mean, obviously, they're not coming

01:23:46.357 --> 01:23:48.257
to a wizard's tower.

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:49.847
TALIESIN: I think it's a great idea.
LIAM: Good.

01:23:49.847 --> 01:23:52.796
LAURA: As long as, you know, Trent won't be spying on us

01:23:52.796 --> 01:23:56.297
and will use Veth's family as collateral

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:57.997
and do something evil.

01:23:57.997 --> 01:24:00.607
SAM: Ooh, yeah. Maybe we should leave them here for this,

01:24:00.607 --> 01:24:02.727
until after the Trent dinner and then

01:24:02.727 --> 01:24:04.365
we can bring them up.

01:24:04.365 --> 01:24:05.724
LAURA: Yeah, and then they can come with us to Zadash

01:24:05.724 --> 01:24:07.094
and they can see my dad!

01:24:08.297 --> 01:24:09.130
LIAM: Okay.

01:24:10.787 --> 01:24:11.820
SAM: Yeah. Yeah.

01:24:13.857 --> 01:24:15.865
TALIESIN: I like Zadash. That'll be nice.

01:24:17.597 --> 01:24:19.867
SAM: Yeah. Just in case there's a horrible,

01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:22.007
you know, murder tonight.

01:24:22.007 --> 01:24:23.273
TALIESIN: Murder wizard.

01:24:24.176 --> 01:24:25.467
SAM: Yeah.

01:24:25.467 --> 01:24:27.667
ASHLEY: You say that so happy.

01:24:27.667 --> 01:24:29.117
TALIESIN: Just rolled off the tongue.

01:24:30.487 --> 01:24:32.387
SAM: But thank you for the offer.

01:24:32.387 --> 01:24:35.517
So how do we get there? Are you going to teleport us?

01:24:35.517 --> 01:24:37.250
LIAM: Well,

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:40.783
I would prefer to be at peak capability

01:24:40.783 --> 01:24:43.271
this evening, if need be, so I would like to use...

01:24:43.271 --> 01:24:44.677
SAM: I have some of that sex potion

01:24:44.677 --> 01:24:47.140
that I didn't use yet, if you need that.

01:24:48.179 --> 01:24:50.622
LIAM: Maybe on another night.

01:24:51.717 --> 01:24:55.227
I just mean if we get pulled into danger.

01:24:55.227 --> 01:24:58.247
So I would prefer to use the library again,

01:24:58.247 --> 01:24:59.597
if that's all right with you.

01:24:59.597 --> 01:25:03.787
MARISHA: Oh yeah. Do we need to go to Yussa to use that?

01:25:03.787 --> 01:25:05.684
Or can we just go from here and then go there?

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:08.777
LIAM: No, we can go from anywhere, but we would need to land

01:25:10.007 --> 01:25:12.367
at the circle at the Cobalt Soul.

01:25:12.367 --> 01:25:14.317
MARISHA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

01:25:15.637 --> 01:25:17.700
LAURA: Do I need to be in peak form tonight?

01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:24.807
LIAM: Well, you rarely are not, but I would advise it, yeah.

01:25:24.807 --> 01:25:27.607
LAURA: Then I probably should not
send a message ahead of us.

01:25:29.019 --> 01:25:30.102
MARISHA: I think...

01:25:30.102 --> 01:25:30.935
LIAM: You're kind of a big deal now.

01:25:30.935 --> 01:25:32.747
MARISHA: We're above that. Exactly.

01:25:32.747 --> 01:25:35.614
And they know that we're coming in and out. It's fine.

01:25:35.614 --> 01:25:38.547
TALIESIN: Only one way to find out, I suppose.

01:25:38.547 --> 01:25:40.740
LIAM: Put your new status to the test.

01:25:41.617 --> 01:25:43.100
MARISHA: Yeah. Let's go.

01:25:45.267 --> 01:25:49.200
LIAM: Okay. So are we ready now? Any last minute things?

01:25:51.047 --> 01:25:53.163
MARISHA: I look out the window.

01:25:54.138 --> 01:25:56.337
Do I see Thaddeus?

01:25:56.337 --> 01:25:57.947
MATT: Make a perception check.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:25:57.947 --> 01:26:01.000
LIAM: Oh man. That'd be the best.

01:26:04.077 --> 01:26:05.718
MARISHA: Look, you're so-- you're too far.

01:26:05.718 --> 01:26:07.051
It's a natural 20!

01:26:07.051 --> 01:26:09.197
I swear to god, it's a natural 20.

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:10.930
TALIESIN: It's just lumps of rock.

01:26:10.930 --> 01:26:13.766
MARISHA: It's that one. It's that. It's 24 total.

01:26:13.766 --> 01:26:14.599
MATT: Okay.

01:26:16.577 --> 01:26:17.937
As they're all having this conversation,

01:26:17.937 --> 01:26:19.877
getting ready, you just glance over your shoulder,

01:26:19.877 --> 01:26:23.183
out the window and you see about

01:26:23.183 --> 01:26:25.078
a block and a half down the way

01:26:25.078 --> 01:26:26.857
(wings flapping)

01:26:26.857 --> 01:26:27.827
something fly.

01:26:27.827 --> 01:26:31.740
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. Right before we poof.

01:26:33.107 --> 01:26:35.237
MATT: Well, you have to step through.

01:26:35.237 --> 01:26:37.091
MARISHA: Son of a bi--

01:26:38.542 --> 01:26:40.737
MATT: (thudding, whooshing)

01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:42.536
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) Yeah.

01:26:43.438 --> 01:26:44.437
TALIESIN: (magic pulsing)

01:26:44.437 --> 01:26:45.270
MARISHA: What?!

01:26:47.297 --> 01:26:50.647
MATT: As you all emerge--
LIAM: (hooting)

01:26:50.647 --> 01:26:52.505
MATT: -- in the familiar subterranean basement

01:26:52.505 --> 01:26:55.460
of the Rexxentrum Archive of the Cobalt Soul.

01:26:56.337 --> 01:26:57.897
You can see there is an individual

01:26:57.897 --> 01:26:59.880
who is sitting there,

01:27:00.867 --> 01:27:04.397
currently writing in a small book, glance up and...

01:27:04.397 --> 01:27:05.597
(chair screeches)

01:27:05.597 --> 01:27:06.747
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

01:27:09.062 --> 01:27:10.867
Expositor Beau.

01:27:10.867 --> 01:27:12.479
MATT: "Right."
MARISHA: Thanks.

01:27:12.479 --> 01:27:14.572
MATT: "We weren't made aware of, um..."

01:27:15.692 --> 01:27:18.827
LAURA: I was going to send you a message ahead of time,

01:27:18.827 --> 01:27:21.717
but I need all my spells, you know.

01:27:21.717 --> 01:27:22.550
MATT: "Certainly."

01:27:24.782 --> 01:27:28.827
As you guys all walk past, make your way up into the

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:31.357
library proper, once again the massive interior

01:27:31.357 --> 01:27:33.207
of this amazing library.

01:27:33.207 --> 01:27:38.207
Since last you were here, meeting with Yudala Fon

01:27:38.531 --> 01:27:40.607
and a few other members, Crook, the day before.

01:27:40.607 --> 01:27:41.937
LIAM: Yeah.

01:27:41.937 --> 01:27:43.127
MATT: What would you like to do?

01:27:43.127 --> 01:27:47.272
MARISHA: I guess-- nah. She said she'd contact me.

01:27:47.272 --> 01:27:49.177
MATT: They.
MARISHA: They'd contact me.

01:27:49.177 --> 01:27:51.219
It's fine. Let's just move on.

01:27:51.219 --> 01:27:53.227
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:27:53.227 --> 01:27:56.187
SAM: What time is it? Midday?

01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:58.057
MATT: No, right now it's early morning. You guys have

01:27:58.057 --> 01:28:00.337
plenty of time. Is there anything you want to do

01:28:00.337 --> 01:28:02.923
before tonight in Rexxentrum or otherwise?

01:28:02.923 --> 01:28:04.807
If you have means of teleport and such, like,

01:28:04.807 --> 01:28:07.880
you have ways to go. So.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.057
TRAVIS: I love Matt.

01:28:09.057 --> 01:28:10.737
MATT: I'm just saying don't feel constrained.

01:28:10.737 --> 01:28:12.070
TRAVIS: "You're all just going to dinner, huh?

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:13.663
"Just going to dinner!"

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:15.651
(laughter)

01:28:15.651 --> 01:28:17.334
TRAVIS: "You got all day!"

01:28:18.616 --> 01:28:19.747
ASHLEY: Just want to go straight in.

01:28:19.747 --> 01:28:21.719
TALIESIN: Clock's ticking.
MATT: I mean, you totally can!

01:28:21.719 --> 01:28:23.716
LAURA: No, no, no.
LIAM: Sun's still shining on you.

01:28:23.716 --> 01:28:25.657
LAURA: We should get some winter clothes, getting

01:28:25.657 --> 01:28:28.597
prepared so that it can be made while we're,

01:28:28.597 --> 01:28:29.932
you know, doing other things.

01:28:29.932 --> 01:28:30.990
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:32.543
LAURA: Sometimes it might take, like, a week to get

01:28:32.543 --> 01:28:33.667
a coat made or something.

01:28:33.667 --> 01:28:37.337
ASHLEY: Was there any research? Did we already research

01:28:37.337 --> 01:28:39.781
the Nine Eyes and all that stuff that we were going to do?

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:40.757
LIAM: Beauregard's delegating.

01:28:40.757 --> 01:28:42.463
TALIESIN: Going through there.
ASHLEY: That's right. That's right.

01:28:42.463 --> 01:28:44.397
TALIESIN: Going to your dad, I think that would be

01:28:44.397 --> 01:28:45.997
a good thing to poke around in.

01:28:45.997 --> 01:28:47.534
ASHLEY: Before we...
LAURA: Yeah.

01:28:47.534 --> 01:28:49.007
But not today.

01:28:49.007 --> 01:28:50.877
LIAM: Not today.
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.

01:28:50.877 --> 01:28:55.377
LIAM: But you're right, we could get some clothing orders

01:28:55.377 --> 01:28:58.027
in now, so that they'll be done hopefully by the end

01:28:58.027 --> 01:29:00.127
of the week, because it is going to be cold

01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:04.507
as a motherfuck up on top of the world.

01:29:04.507 --> 01:29:07.087
TRAVIS: Do I have this map or is this just for reference?

01:29:07.087 --> 01:29:08.427
Was this given to us?

01:29:08.427 --> 01:29:10.299
MATT: That was given to you...

01:29:12.145 --> 01:29:15.907
Or, actually, DeRogna still has it, but showed it to you.

01:29:15.907 --> 01:29:16.740
TRAVIS: Cool. Nevermind.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:20.521
MATT: So, and with your keen mind,
you would have a very clear.

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:22.567
LIAM: (high-pitched nerdy groan)
MATT: Yep. Just like that.

01:29:22.567 --> 01:29:23.792
That's the sound it makes every time you use it.

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:28.583
LAURA: Should we research the city of Aeor?

01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:30.549
Eeyore? Aeor?
SAM: Eh.

01:29:31.847 --> 01:29:34.567
LIAM: (mimics character of Eeyore) The fine city of Aeor.

01:29:34.567 --> 01:29:36.364
MATT: You guys can research whatever you want to

01:29:36.364 --> 01:29:37.197
with the time you got.

01:29:37.197 --> 01:29:38.347
LAURA: Because we're here.

01:29:38.347 --> 01:29:39.422
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.

01:29:39.422 --> 01:29:40.737
LAURA: We got in the library, might as well.

01:29:40.737 --> 01:29:42.077
MARISHA: I'm going to check with the monks, too,

01:29:42.077 --> 01:29:45.760
to see if they actually have some winter garb

01:29:46.617 --> 01:29:50.884
that might be a little bit more official, uniform.

01:29:50.884 --> 01:29:52.527
LAURA: Good call, good call.
MARISHA: So yeah.

01:29:52.527 --> 01:29:56.727
So I'll actually double back inside.

01:29:56.727 --> 01:29:57.560
MATT: Okay.

01:29:58.787 --> 01:30:03.227
MARISHA: And yeah, talk to somebody,
and be like, "Outfit me."

01:30:03.227 --> 01:30:08.227
MATT: Okay. Some of the various archivists,

01:30:08.227 --> 01:30:12.647
or the keepers of the library take you to one of the

01:30:12.647 --> 01:30:14.087
outfitting chambers there where they have a lot of their

01:30:14.087 --> 01:30:16.847
standard uniforms for different positions,

01:30:16.847 --> 01:30:19.820
as well as different weather, and battle armaments and such.

01:30:20.657 --> 01:30:25.107
They don't have anything that is on its own prepared

01:30:25.107 --> 01:30:28.927
for the cold that you've been told to prepare for.

01:30:28.927 --> 01:30:33.927
But there are some "expositor plus" gear that you can bring

01:30:34.007 --> 01:30:37.147
that is the beginnings of an outfit that is prepared

01:30:37.147 --> 01:30:39.817
for the weather you're going to be encountering.

01:30:39.817 --> 01:30:42.757
Heavy fur lining in some cases,

01:30:42.757 --> 01:30:45.547
thicker pants with multiple layers,

01:30:45.547 --> 01:30:47.897
heavy boots that are designed for harsher terrain

01:30:47.897 --> 01:30:51.317
as well as to prevent moisture from soaking into the center.

01:30:51.317 --> 01:30:52.627
So you get some elements like that.

01:30:52.627 --> 01:30:54.927
You still would probably need to supplement that with

01:30:54.927 --> 01:30:57.527
like cloak, hood, and probably something

01:30:57.527 --> 01:30:59.477
for your arms, if you really want to.

01:30:59.477 --> 01:31:02.717
MARISHA: Okay. I'll grab a pair of pants, like baggy,

01:31:02.717 --> 01:31:05.717
almost look like gaucho pants that are fur-lined.

01:31:05.717 --> 01:31:08.057
Take my expositor belt that Dairon gave me

01:31:08.057 --> 01:31:10.117
that I haven't really adorned yet,

01:31:10.117 --> 01:31:12.970
and officially tie it around my waist.

01:31:13.818 --> 01:31:16.447
It's a slate gray that fades,

01:31:16.447 --> 01:31:19.114
very much in the style that my first belt went to,

01:31:19.114 --> 01:31:21.935
but fades to a royal cobalt blue.

01:31:24.417 --> 01:31:28.120
And then I grab a fur-lined vest off as well.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.477
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Just throw that on. Start there.

01:31:30.477 --> 01:31:31.837
MATT: Okay.

01:31:31.837 --> 01:31:33.437
MARISHA: Do they have any, like, pins or anything?

01:31:33.437 --> 01:31:37.233
Like Ioun pins or badges or something? I don't know.

01:31:38.067 --> 01:31:41.037
MATT: I mean, there are different elements of iconography

01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:43.307
that you can use to adorn yourself, if you like.

01:31:43.307 --> 01:31:46.120
You may have to refashion, or fashion it to you.

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:48.637
MARISHA: Like a little All-Seeing Eye broach or something.

01:31:48.637 --> 01:31:49.990
MATT: Okay. You got it.

01:31:50.957 --> 01:31:52.496
LIAM: Some TGIF flair?

01:31:52.496 --> 01:31:56.120
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hate Mondays. Yeah.

01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:58.827
MATT: Yeah. Not a lot of flair in the library there,

01:31:58.827 --> 01:32:01.114
unfortunately. All right.

01:32:01.114 --> 01:32:04.855
MARISHA: And then I guess on the way out,

01:32:04.855 --> 01:32:06.421
I'll grab Caleb.

01:32:06.421 --> 01:32:07.857
Should we-- should we do some research?

01:32:07.857 --> 01:32:09.240
Wanna hit the books?

01:32:10.097 --> 01:32:12.557
LIAM: You want to look into flying cities?

01:32:12.557 --> 01:32:15.040
MARISHA: I guess, I don't know what else to do with my time.

01:32:15.953 --> 01:32:17.167
LIAM: (sighs)

01:32:17.167 --> 01:32:20.902
Yeah, we have to-- I still need to go shopping, but.

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:23.897
MARISHA: Well, how about you go shop. I'll pull some books.

01:32:23.897 --> 01:32:26.087
Feel free to come back whenever.

01:32:26.087 --> 01:32:28.267
LIAM: You pull books, and then I will come back

01:32:28.267 --> 01:32:29.377
and help you read.

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:30.612
MARISHA: Great.
LIAM: Okay.

01:32:31.467 --> 01:32:32.877
MARISHA: I start my thing.

01:32:32.877 --> 01:32:34.277
MATT: All right. What are you researching?

01:32:34.277 --> 01:32:35.917
Who's researching what while you're here?

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:38.097
MARISHA: I'm going to talk to one of the scribes.

01:32:38.097 --> 01:32:43.097
One of the archivists. Aeor, fall-foul-Farlan... wait.

01:32:43.807 --> 01:32:46.424
Todd McFarland. What was...

01:32:46.424 --> 01:32:48.747
TRAVIS: Foren?
MARISHA: Foren? Yes.

01:32:49.837 --> 01:32:50.670
That.

01:32:53.448 --> 01:32:56.577
And anything about potential, like, weapons or magics

01:32:56.577 --> 01:32:57.777
or anything that we might find there.

01:32:57.777 --> 01:32:59.829
TRAVIS: Allowak's Sanctuary?

01:32:59.829 --> 01:33:01.770
MARISHA: And the Allowak's Sanctuary.

01:33:02.737 --> 01:33:07.620
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an investigation check for me.

01:33:09.547 --> 01:33:13.063
MARISHA: Okay. [inaudible muttering]

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:17.407
All right. Don't fuck this up. Don't fuck this up.

01:33:17.407 --> 01:33:21.923
Okay. Okay. Uh...

01:33:21.923 --> 01:33:23.337
26.

01:33:23.337 --> 01:33:24.767
LAURA: Ooh!

01:33:24.767 --> 01:33:26.638
MARISHA: Rolled a 17.
MATT: Not bad.

01:33:26.638 --> 01:33:28.357
Okay.

01:33:28.357 --> 01:33:33.037
Foren is the name of the centralmost and largest

01:33:33.037 --> 01:33:35.530
body of land in Eiselcross.

01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:38.592
Eiselcross is made up of numerous smaller

01:33:40.257 --> 01:33:42.257
sections of land, like islands, larger islands,

01:33:42.257 --> 01:33:44.357
that cluster around its space there.

01:33:45.362 --> 01:33:47.087
Most of the area is above the tree line.

01:33:47.087 --> 01:33:49.367
There are some sporadic trees and such,

01:33:49.367 --> 01:33:51.500
but a lot of it's just open snowy tundra.

01:33:52.337 --> 01:33:57.137
Blizzard-scarred landscapes, and jagged mountains

01:33:57.137 --> 01:33:59.303
of gray and white stone.

01:34:01.531 --> 01:34:02.364
You...

01:34:03.415 --> 01:34:06.047
There's not a whole lot to the history there.

01:34:06.047 --> 01:34:10.867
There is no historical value to the location

01:34:10.867 --> 01:34:12.277
that is recorded necessarily.

01:34:12.277 --> 01:34:15.920
It's too far north for people to go and want to live.

01:34:16.857 --> 01:34:21.390
So it seems like the first society

01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:22.465
that went that direction,

01:34:22.465 --> 01:34:24.577
out of just general curiosity and expedition attempts

01:34:24.577 --> 01:34:26.637
was through Uthodurn.

01:34:26.637 --> 01:34:27.862
MARISHA: Okay.

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:31.847
MATT: And there was a village of Syrinlya

01:34:31.847 --> 01:34:34.307
that was founded by them, but it was mainly

01:34:34.307 --> 01:34:35.837
just a fishing village that was trying to take up

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:37.997
whatever resources were available on that northern side.

01:34:37.997 --> 01:34:39.807
Not too terribly far from where Uthodurn was,

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:42.320
just across the sea comparatively.

01:34:43.247 --> 01:34:47.029
And you also learn that

01:34:49.047 --> 01:34:53.827
there were strange artifacts being brought back from

01:34:54.771 --> 01:34:59.040
those small outposts of Uthodurn
that were being traded south.

01:35:00.157 --> 01:35:02.784
And this is over the past half a century or so.

01:35:02.784 --> 01:35:03.643
MARISHA: Oh.

01:35:03.643 --> 01:35:07.027
MATT: They were just strange little sections of

01:35:07.027 --> 01:35:09.517
relics and things that-- some were nonfunctional,

01:35:09.517 --> 01:35:12.007
some held some power within them still.

01:35:12.007 --> 01:35:15.247
And that's what began to draw

01:35:15.247 --> 01:35:20.247
the curiosity and interest of the Empire.

01:35:21.143 --> 01:35:23.262
And then the Empire began to build their own outpost

01:35:23.262 --> 01:35:25.807
up there, known as Balenpost.

01:35:25.807 --> 01:35:28.112
MARISHA: That's Balenpost. Okay.

01:35:29.177 --> 01:35:30.967
MATT: You learn that the journey northward--

01:35:30.967 --> 01:35:35.184
technically it's a shorter ship ride between

01:35:36.077 --> 01:35:39.507
Bysaes Tyl, which is the northernmost elven,

01:35:39.507 --> 01:35:41.767
primarily elven city of the Empire.

01:35:41.767 --> 01:35:44.797
However, the Frozen Depths of that ocean channel there

01:35:44.797 --> 01:35:46.987
is extremely dangerous to travel.

01:35:46.987 --> 01:35:50.847
So most people prefer to go the lengthier, but safer route

01:35:50.847 --> 01:35:54.518
from Palebank Village to the south area of Foren.

01:35:57.327 --> 01:36:00.972
To confirm what you heard from Vess DeRogna,

01:36:02.467 --> 01:36:05.194
there are number of regions on the island of Foren

01:36:05.194 --> 01:36:09.667
and a lot across Eiselcross that just have strange flares

01:36:09.667 --> 01:36:14.667
and odd regions of wild magic, where magic of all kinds

01:36:14.867 --> 01:36:17.817
seems to be bent or twisted

01:36:17.817 --> 01:36:21.877
and having effects that you weren't expecting.

01:36:21.877 --> 01:36:25.010
Certain incantations could give you odd, unexpected results.

01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:28.343
Certain incantations could give you odd, unexpected results.

01:36:28.343 --> 01:36:29.877
And depending on the powers that are

01:36:29.877 --> 01:36:33.929
attempting to be evoked, can be extremely dangerous.

01:36:33.929 --> 01:36:37.135
MARISHA: And that's any magic user that was attempting to...

01:36:37.135 --> 01:36:37.968
MATT: Correct.

01:36:39.018 --> 01:36:40.036
MARISHA: Okay.

01:36:40.036 --> 01:36:41.169
MATT: With that roll--
MARISHA: So-- okay.

01:36:41.169 --> 01:36:45.536
MATT: With that roll, there's only
a little bit of information

01:36:45.536 --> 01:36:50.327
that's coming directly from Eiselcross and the excavations

01:36:50.327 --> 01:36:52.367
currently to the Cobalt Soul, because it is a very,

01:36:52.367 --> 01:36:55.317
very carefully guarded location.

01:36:55.317 --> 01:36:59.109
And for the most part, there is a...

01:37:01.007 --> 01:37:04.187
There's a lot of mistrust up north and there are a lot of--

01:37:05.067 --> 01:37:07.727
apparently a number of decades, still, of

01:37:07.727 --> 01:37:10.367
subtle skirmishes and elements of violence

01:37:10.367 --> 01:37:12.287
and bloodshed between the Dynasty and the Empire

01:37:12.287 --> 01:37:14.027
in those regions before the war ever broke out.

01:37:14.027 --> 01:37:18.050
And most likely after the peace was even set, recently.

01:37:18.907 --> 01:37:20.633
Based around these excavations.

01:37:20.633 --> 01:37:21.466
MARISHA: Okay.

01:37:21.466 --> 01:37:24.197
MATT: And there is the central excavation, the biggest one

01:37:24.197 --> 01:37:27.487
where it is believed where these relics came from.

01:37:27.487 --> 01:37:30.577
And many people surmise that at least a portion

01:37:30.577 --> 01:37:35.417
of the ancient city of Aeor exists.

01:37:35.417 --> 01:37:39.077
And there are smaller sites throughout where smaller pieces

01:37:39.077 --> 01:37:42.302
may have fallen, where similar relics had been uncovered.

01:37:43.177 --> 01:37:46.337
MARISHA: Can I go talk to another one of the archivists or

01:37:46.337 --> 01:37:48.487
whatever, and I'm going to point at

01:37:48.487 --> 01:37:51.397
the artifacts that he's talking about,

01:37:51.397 --> 01:37:54.597
or that I'm reading about, and just ask if

01:37:54.597 --> 01:37:59.547
we have any here we're holding on to?

01:37:59.547 --> 01:38:02.957
MATT: "Unfortunately we do not. Most of those have been

01:38:02.957 --> 01:38:07.627
"put under the... (sighs) put under...

01:38:07.627 --> 01:38:12.400
"They have been <i>taken</i>
and are maintained by the Cerberus Assembly."

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:16.667
MARISHA: I knew that's what you
were going to fucking say. Okay.

01:38:16.667 --> 01:38:19.247
All right. Okay.

01:38:19.247 --> 01:38:23.807
MATT: As far as Aeor itself, with that roll,

01:38:23.807 --> 01:38:26.240
there isn't a lot of information.

01:38:27.077 --> 01:38:30.217
What you do know corresponds with some information

01:38:30.217 --> 01:38:33.217
you've already uncovered. It was a mageocracy.

01:38:33.217 --> 01:38:36.457
It was considered one of the most powerful, if not the most

01:38:36.457 --> 01:38:40.207
powerful of the pre-Calamity,

01:38:41.107 --> 01:38:44.473
arcane-centric societies.

01:38:46.937 --> 01:38:49.007
It was massive.

01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:54.007
It was quite populated, and

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:58.366
was driven by the belief

01:38:58.366 --> 01:39:01.949
that mortality--

01:39:01.949 --> 01:39:06.949
the gift of magic to the mortal was a gift

01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:12.245
as well as a challenge by the gods to eventually show

01:39:12.245 --> 01:39:15.492
that the creations can become the creator.

01:39:16.437 --> 01:39:21.430
The idea that if a mortal can acquire this much power

01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:22.754
The idea that if a mortal can acquire this much power

01:39:22.754 --> 01:39:27.417
to destroy its own creator, then does that not make itself--

01:39:27.417 --> 01:39:30.491
the gods themselves, you know, as they are.

01:39:30.491 --> 01:39:34.207
And that belief

01:39:34.207 --> 01:39:35.815
varied throughout the populace there,

01:39:35.815 --> 01:39:38.517
but those in power firmly felt that there was...

01:39:42.227 --> 01:39:47.227
there was a drive to, whether it be

01:39:47.652 --> 01:39:50.485
to save Exandria from the destruction of the coming Calamity

01:39:50.485 --> 01:39:52.947
by eliminating the Pantheon entirely,

01:39:52.947 --> 01:39:55.287
or for personally selfish reasons.

01:39:55.287 --> 01:39:57.447
There's no specific record.

01:39:57.447 --> 01:39:59.797
Most of this is just hearsay from survivors

01:39:59.797 --> 01:40:02.087
of other parts of the region.

01:40:02.087 --> 01:40:03.867
It is believed that there were

01:40:03.867 --> 01:40:06.237
no survivors of the fall of Aeor.

01:40:06.237 --> 01:40:10.247
There is no written or verbal record

01:40:10.247 --> 01:40:13.147
from inside the society, all from those that--

01:40:14.262 --> 01:40:15.096
MARISHA: Remember it.

01:40:15.096 --> 01:40:16.917
MATT: -- remember it from an outside perspective.

01:40:16.917 --> 01:40:19.527
MARISHA: Pompeii style.
MATT: If you will.

01:40:19.527 --> 01:40:21.321
MARISHA: People from Crete watching it go down.

01:40:21.321 --> 01:40:22.813
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:40:25.427 --> 01:40:26.527
All right.

01:40:30.987 --> 01:40:32.337
MATT: Anything else?

01:40:32.337 --> 01:40:35.007
MARISHA: I relay all that info to him when he comes back.

01:40:35.007 --> 01:40:35.840
MATT: Okay.

01:40:38.247 --> 01:40:41.145
LIAM: Put a pin in that. I want to return to that.

01:40:42.537 --> 01:40:43.567
Well, we're going shopping.

01:40:43.567 --> 01:40:45.267
LAURA: Yeah, I want to buy clothes!

01:40:45.267 --> 01:40:50.267
MATT: Okay! All right. I'd say...

01:40:51.217 --> 01:40:53.507
LIAM: I would have some idea of where to look for

01:40:53.507 --> 01:40:55.567
sturdy fare, finer fare.

01:40:55.567 --> 01:40:56.400
MATT: Oh yeah.

01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.557
LIAM: Fashionable, but also functional.

01:40:58.557 --> 01:41:00.753
LAURA: I want fashionable.

01:41:00.753 --> 01:41:02.761
TALIESIN: You want to look good.

01:41:02.761 --> 01:41:04.153
For the nobody that we're going to see, we want...

01:41:04.153 --> 01:41:08.141
SAM: Yeah, if we're going into the
tundra, we want to look hot.

01:41:08.141 --> 01:41:09.601
TALIESIN: Exquisite corpses.

01:41:09.601 --> 01:41:11.496
LIAM: You want to <i>be</i> hot.

01:41:11.496 --> 01:41:13.545
MATT: Look, it's important. I respect that.

01:41:14.777 --> 01:41:15.793
All righty.

01:41:19.324 --> 01:41:21.257
We'll say within the Vigil Circle,

01:41:21.257 --> 01:41:24.907
you find a-- for lack of a better term,

01:41:24.907 --> 01:41:27.453
the garment district of Rexxentrum.

01:41:28.537 --> 01:41:31.717
There are a number of supplies and wholesalers and

01:41:31.717 --> 01:41:35.820
textile warehouses that sell fine materials, fabric silks,

01:41:36.667 --> 01:41:39.197
both crafted within the Empire and imported from beyond.

01:41:39.197 --> 01:41:41.497
And there are a number of very, very talented,

01:41:42.607 --> 01:41:46.547
for a price, of course, custom tailors that can be hired

01:41:46.547 --> 01:41:48.817
and commissioned for specific pieces.

01:41:48.817 --> 01:41:50.917
So what is it you're looking to have made?

01:41:52.947 --> 01:41:56.197
LIAM: I am looking to return to my Empire roots

01:41:56.197 --> 01:42:01.107
and I commission a long, thick, warm coat,

01:42:01.107 --> 01:42:04.527
very much akin to the coat that everyone met me in.

01:42:04.527 --> 01:42:08.737
However, this one will not be moth-eaten and disgusting.

01:42:08.737 --> 01:42:13.403
So it will be brown and leather,

01:42:13.403 --> 01:42:15.703
long coat, fur-lined.

01:42:15.703 --> 01:42:20.027
I will get a very thick scarf and I will also find a

01:42:20.027 --> 01:42:24.807
leather worker who can build me a new harness for my books.

01:42:24.807 --> 01:42:27.257
The spell book is getting pretty fat

01:42:27.257 --> 01:42:29.497
and can no longer fit under my armpit.

01:42:29.497 --> 01:42:33.577
So the book on the left will still hang about here,

01:42:33.577 --> 01:42:35.110
but I have--

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.576
I describe a case or a harness that is more

01:42:39.576 --> 01:42:42.557
phone book-sized that hangs off of my right hip.

01:42:42.557 --> 01:42:44.307
MATT: Right. Almost like a side satchel.

01:42:44.307 --> 01:42:47.377
LIAM: Yeah. But then I want them to have it hooked

01:42:47.377 --> 01:42:50.107
to my belt so that it's not flying all over the place

01:42:50.107 --> 01:42:52.537
when we are running for our dear lives.

01:42:52.537 --> 01:42:53.377
MARISHA: Cool.

01:42:53.377 --> 01:42:57.577
LIAM: And then that will be counterbalanced
by my old satchel,

01:42:57.577 --> 01:43:00.167
which I will keep, where I keep all my spell components

01:43:00.167 --> 01:43:01.757
and other odds and ends.

01:43:01.757 --> 01:43:04.957
MATT: All righty. Okay. I'd say you
have all those pieces commissioned.

01:43:04.957 --> 01:43:08.217
It'll take a few days to gather the materials

01:43:08.217 --> 01:43:11.419
and create the pieces and it'll run you about

01:43:12.997 --> 01:43:15.127
25 gold pieces for the entire outfit.

01:43:15.127 --> 01:43:15.960
LIAM: Done.

01:43:17.477 --> 01:43:18.804
MATT: Okay.

01:43:18.804 --> 01:43:20.267
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:43:20.267 --> 01:43:22.227
LAURA: I just drew it, so I'm going to just describe

01:43:22.227 --> 01:43:23.927
what I just came up with.

01:43:23.927 --> 01:43:28.026
I'm going to go and get--

01:43:28.026 --> 01:43:32.893
Okay, I'm going to get a light blue tunic

01:43:33.801 --> 01:43:35.376
with long sleeves.

01:43:35.376 --> 01:43:37.237
I don't need, like, super thick stuff because

01:43:37.237 --> 01:43:39.377
I am resistant to the cold, so.

01:43:39.377 --> 01:43:42.407
This is more for fashion. A tunic.

01:43:42.407 --> 01:43:44.847
I'm going to get some light gray,

01:43:44.847 --> 01:43:47.117
thermal tights sort of thing.

01:43:47.117 --> 01:43:49.415
And then I'm going to get some...

01:43:49.415 --> 01:43:50.782
SAM: Arc'teryx?
TRAVIS: Yup.

01:43:50.782 --> 01:43:51.796
LAURA: (giggles)

01:43:51.796 --> 01:43:53.417
You know, D&amp;D tights.

01:43:53.417 --> 01:43:54.913
TRAVIS: $250. Yeah.
SAM: Under Armour.

01:43:54.913 --> 01:43:56.295
LAURA: I'm going to get...

01:43:56.295 --> 01:43:58.460
LIAM: She's resistant, so she'll only take half damage.

01:43:59.517 --> 01:44:03.297
LAURA: I'm going to get some long, knitted thigh highs

01:44:03.297 --> 01:44:05.047
that are, like, knitted like Fair Isle.

01:44:05.047 --> 01:44:07.027
Anybody that knows me know what I'm talking about.

01:44:07.027 --> 01:44:11.293
It's stripes and stuff with designs
knitted into them, you know,

01:44:11.293 --> 01:44:13.595
It's stripes and stuff with designs
knitted into them, you know,

01:44:13.595 --> 01:44:17.944
that are, like, flowers and bees.

01:44:17.944 --> 01:44:20.287
I want to get bees knitted into them.

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:23.187
And I imagine this will cost a pretty penny

01:44:23.187 --> 01:44:27.487
because it is pretty specific, but it's going to be in

01:44:27.487 --> 01:44:32.403
a pale blue and white

01:44:32.403 --> 01:44:33.953
and light gray.

01:44:35.067 --> 01:44:40.067
And then I'm going to get an overcoat that is white

01:44:40.097 --> 01:44:45.097
and it's fur-lined with a pale gray fur,

01:44:45.397 --> 01:44:47.257
so it's showing the trim

01:44:47.257 --> 01:44:49.417
and I want it to be bell sleeves.

01:44:49.417 --> 01:44:53.173
And then, and it will be fitted to about here and then

01:44:53.173 --> 01:44:54.667
it's going to flare out and it's going to have a

01:44:54.667 --> 01:44:59.312
little hood on it. Um, yeah! That's pretty much it!

01:44:59.312 --> 01:45:00.209
MATT: As you finish---

01:45:00.209 --> 01:45:03.037
LAURA: Oh, and I'm going to get some earmuffs to match that.

01:45:03.037 --> 01:45:05.997
And some boots, you know, that are fur-lined boots.

01:45:05.997 --> 01:45:08.414
Obviously to look good,

01:45:08.414 --> 01:45:10.637
that are going to match my coat and stuff.

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:12.146
LIAM: Matt is the store clerk.

01:45:12.146 --> 01:45:14.447
MATT: No, that is exactly what I was going to--

01:45:14.447 --> 01:45:16.057
As you finish your statement, you look up and you see

01:45:16.057 --> 01:45:18.717
the middle-aged gentleman with his glasses,

01:45:18.717 --> 01:45:22.747
his chin tuft of white goatee, his hair slicked back

01:45:22.747 --> 01:45:25.187
with this pencil sticking out through the back of his ear.

01:45:25.187 --> 01:45:30.147
Just going, "And how soon did you need this, lass?"

01:45:30.147 --> 01:45:32.228
LAURA: In, like, a week? Is that doable?

01:45:33.967 --> 01:45:35.917
MATT: "Give me just a second."
LAURA: Okay.

01:45:37.697 --> 01:45:39.137
MATT: He rushes off to the back room

01:45:39.137 --> 01:45:40.126
and you hear some voices, like,

01:45:40.126 --> 01:45:43.443
(whispering)

01:45:46.121 --> 01:45:49.717
"I think we should be able to take care of your request.

01:45:49.717 --> 01:45:54.517
"Of course, this is quite a commission

01:45:54.517 --> 01:45:57.267
"in a very tight period with very specific materials

01:45:57.267 --> 01:46:00.517
"and with quite a number of

01:46:00.517 --> 01:46:03.241
"custom knitted elements."
LAURA: Yes, oh yeah.

01:46:03.241 --> 01:46:05.467
You'll have to have a very good knitter.

01:46:05.467 --> 01:46:07.830
MATT: "We can do this outfit for...

01:46:11.321 --> 01:46:13.167
"120 gold pieces."

01:46:13.167 --> 01:46:16.283
LAURA: Ooh, I'll give you 500 gold,

01:46:16.283 --> 01:46:19.258
and I would like if it had--

01:46:19.258 --> 01:46:23.252
could you add some embroidery along the coat edges as well?

01:46:24.787 --> 01:46:25.767
MATT: "Of course."

01:46:25.767 --> 01:46:29.617
LAURA: Wonderful. I would love some pink and blue flowers

01:46:29.617 --> 01:46:32.627
and maybe some pale yellow bees embroidered on there

01:46:32.627 --> 01:46:36.077
as well, with some beautiful green, like, vines wrapping

01:46:36.077 --> 01:46:38.307
around everything, you know, like an emerald green?

01:46:38.307 --> 01:46:40.717
Something that really reminds you of the Tra--

01:46:40.717 --> 01:46:44.057
Something like, you know, just a pretty green.

01:46:44.057 --> 01:46:46.256
MATT: "Right, I am following you. Yes."

01:46:46.256 --> 01:46:48.253
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: "All right. Yes.

01:46:48.253 --> 01:46:51.367
"That will definitely be done.

01:46:51.367 --> 01:46:53.207
"I think you'll be very happy with the results."

01:46:53.207 --> 01:46:54.487
LAURA: Wonderful. Thank you so much.

01:46:54.487 --> 01:46:56.187
MATT: "Of course, of course.

01:46:56.187 --> 01:46:58.167
"Uh, half upfront and then half upon the

01:46:58.167 --> 01:47:00.523
completion of that.
LAURA: Of course! Yeah!

01:47:02.474 --> 01:47:06.167
MATT: So you mark off 250 now and pay 250 at the arrival.

01:47:06.167 --> 01:47:09.759
He went from completely exasperated by the whole thing

01:47:09.759 --> 01:47:14.684
to extremely giddy and jubilant in a way that

01:47:14.684 --> 01:47:18.307
you didn't expect such an individual to exhibit.

01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:19.497
LIAM: You just saved his business.

01:47:19.497 --> 01:47:20.638
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: There's a tailor

01:47:20.638 --> 01:47:21.721
in the back, screaming,

01:47:21.721 --> 01:47:23.900
"Nine women can't make a baby in a month!"

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:27.392
(laughter)

01:47:31.277 --> 01:47:32.387
MATT: All right.

01:47:32.387 --> 01:47:33.287
SAM: Who's next?

01:47:33.287 --> 01:47:34.857
MATT: Anyone else?

01:47:34.857 --> 01:47:35.690
LIAM: Ladies?

01:47:35.690 --> 01:47:38.335
SAM: I would like to-- do you have something?

01:47:38.335 --> 01:47:40.227
ASHLEY: I'll come up with something, I'm sure.

01:47:40.227 --> 01:47:43.093
SAM: I would like a long-sleeve, fur Lolita dress.

01:47:43.093 --> 01:47:46.657
SAM: I would like a long-sleeve, fur Lolita dress.

01:47:46.657 --> 01:47:47.957
LAURA: Ooh!

01:47:47.957 --> 01:47:51.547
SAM: It's a Lolita coat and dress, with a bow knot

01:47:51.547 --> 01:47:54.557
in the middle and the belt line, and...

01:47:54.557 --> 01:47:55.537
I looked this up before.

01:47:55.537 --> 01:48:00.067
I want it made out of pink fabric and white fur trim

01:48:00.067 --> 01:48:04.207
on all of the trim places, big buttons down the middle.

01:48:04.207 --> 01:48:06.223
SAM: This is fucking adorable.

01:48:07.257 --> 01:48:09.457
SAM: White hand muff.

01:48:09.457 --> 01:48:12.932
And then I'd like earmuffs, too,

01:48:12.932 --> 01:48:16.207
but very special ear muffs.

01:48:16.207 --> 01:48:20.117
If you can craft them, you know, white fur earmuffs,

01:48:20.117 --> 01:48:23.067
but this piece, the headpiece or whatever,

01:48:23.067 --> 01:48:26.257
I saw this wonderful, lovely little redhead

01:48:26.257 --> 01:48:29.207
who had these cool antlers, and I'd like to

01:48:29.207 --> 01:48:31.857
imitate those and put those up on top of the ear muffs

01:48:31.857 --> 01:48:35.507
imitate those and put those up on top of the ear muffs

01:48:35.507 --> 01:48:38.557
because they just looked so cool. So I'd like that.

01:48:38.557 --> 01:48:41.857
They can just be little deer, little faun,

01:48:41.857 --> 01:48:44.560
something, you know, just little antlers.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.756
TALIESIN: I can't wait to clean blood stains out of this.

01:48:45.756 --> 01:48:48.867
MARISHA: Oh my goodness!
LIAM: Bowknot in D&amp;D.

01:48:48.867 --> 01:48:50.187
MATT: The first tailor you speak to,

01:48:50.187 --> 01:48:52.210
a middle-aged gentleman with a bit of a gray heft

01:48:52.210 --> 01:48:56.444
of fur on his chin and slicked-back hair and glasses, goes,

01:48:56.444 --> 01:48:58.134
"No, I'm sorry. I'm busy for the next week,"

01:48:58.134 --> 01:49:00.167
(slamming) and closes the door.

01:49:00.167 --> 01:49:04.877
But the next tailor you find can take the commission and

01:49:04.877 --> 01:49:07.397
puts a full cost, materials, all in,

01:49:07.397 --> 01:49:10.947
custom elements there, about 40 gold.

01:49:10.947 --> 01:49:15.070
SAM: Cool. Taking Jester's lead, I'll give you 42.

01:49:17.427 --> 01:49:20.567
MATT: "Well. How very kind."

01:49:20.567 --> 01:49:21.417
SAM: And some boots.

01:49:23.237 --> 01:49:24.070
MATT: "45."

01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:25.237
SAM: Great, done.

01:49:25.237 --> 01:49:27.197
MATT: (laughs)

01:49:27.197 --> 01:49:28.600
"All right, see you in a week."

01:49:30.757 --> 01:49:31.590
All right.

01:49:32.457 --> 01:49:33.877
TRAVIS: Who's next?

01:49:33.877 --> 01:49:34.827
SAM: You!

01:49:34.827 --> 01:49:36.677
TALIESIN: I'll go if no one else is going to go.

01:49:38.257 --> 01:49:42.147
So I'm going to find a tailor and probably a leather smith

01:49:42.147 --> 01:49:44.997
and an armor smith, and want to get my

01:49:44.997 --> 01:49:49.550
armor treated, get it oiled and treated for the cold.

01:49:50.797 --> 01:49:53.287
I leave a couple samples, I pull the pieces

01:49:53.287 --> 01:49:54.887
off the shield that are mostly decorative

01:49:54.887 --> 01:49:57.407
to show how it's done.

01:49:57.407 --> 01:49:59.297
Leave a couple of fabric swatches from what I'm already

01:49:59.297 --> 01:50:02.867
wearing. I'm going to leave some of my bits

01:50:02.867 --> 01:50:05.070
there for them to use for the new outfit.

01:50:06.137 --> 01:50:09.267
And I get a big lavender coat with

01:50:10.297 --> 01:50:15.289
white and crimson red stitching in it made.

01:50:15.289 --> 01:50:17.630
white and crimson red stitching in it made.

01:50:17.630 --> 01:50:20.630
A wool hat, it's time for a new hat.

01:50:24.218 --> 01:50:28.337
Black oiled gloves and boots.

01:50:28.337 --> 01:50:33.307
Deep moss green pants, heavy cotton pants

01:50:33.307 --> 01:50:37.477
and a jacket underneath to keep the armor

01:50:37.477 --> 01:50:40.827
off of me, just less than a shirt.

01:50:40.827 --> 01:50:44.577
And then worked into the cloak will be

01:50:44.577 --> 01:50:48.677
some of the dragonfly silk that I've brought from home,

01:50:48.677 --> 01:50:53.677
and we'll have patterns along the edges of

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:56.717
some of the traditional patternwork of

01:50:56.717 --> 01:50:58.787
my original outfit that comes from home.

01:50:58.787 --> 01:51:00.737
MATT: Okay, cool.

01:51:00.737 --> 01:51:02.247
TALIESIN: Nicest thing I've ever owned.

01:51:02.247 --> 01:51:04.957
MATT: No, and it's not a terribly hard commission.

01:51:04.957 --> 01:51:06.667
You're also providing some of the materials for it,

01:51:06.667 --> 01:51:08.140
which would be harder to find.

01:51:09.797 --> 01:51:13.305
That'll put you at about, we'll say 25 gold as well.

01:51:13.305 --> 01:51:16.895
TALIESIN: I'll give him 20.

01:51:16.895 --> 01:51:18.697
I'll throw 40 since we're all being...

01:51:18.697 --> 01:51:21.017
MATT: Okay! Wow, you guys are...

01:51:21.017 --> 01:51:22.017
TALIESIN: It's only money.

01:51:22.017 --> 01:51:24.057
MATT: You guys are making a reputation for yourselves here

01:51:24.057 --> 01:51:26.307
in the middle of this district of Rexxentrum.

01:51:27.707 --> 01:51:29.847
All right. Who else?

01:51:29.847 --> 01:51:32.047
LAURA: Oh, you haven't gone yet, and you haven't gone yet.

01:51:32.047 --> 01:51:33.910
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: You want to go?

01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:35.957
ASHLEY: Well, I do have a question, so.

01:51:35.957 --> 01:51:37.107
MATT: What's your question?

01:51:38.617 --> 01:51:42.617
ASHLEY: Can I-- So, the Coat of the Crest.

01:51:42.617 --> 01:51:46.237
I was thinking of wearing the nobleman's coat.

01:51:46.237 --> 01:51:47.070
MATT: Yeah.

01:51:47.070 --> 01:51:50.507
ASHLEY: Am I able to add anything to it? Like changes,

01:51:50.507 --> 01:51:52.957
like change the look of it?

01:51:52.957 --> 01:51:53.957
MATT: Sure. Yeah.

01:51:53.957 --> 01:51:54.790
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:51:56.927 --> 01:52:01.927
So I will bring that coat and I would like to...

01:52:03.263 --> 01:52:04.797
Everything's going to be black,

01:52:06.567 --> 01:52:10.659
and I would like the sleeves to be those ones

01:52:10.659 --> 01:52:12.092
and I would like the sleeves to be those ones

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:14.097
that are a little wide,

01:52:14.097 --> 01:52:16.030
like make the sleeves a little wider.

01:52:16.997 --> 01:52:19.147
So, you know, I can put my hands in between

01:52:19.147 --> 01:52:20.839
them if cold.

01:52:22.097 --> 01:52:26.235
A sort of leather, drapey hood added onto it

01:52:26.235 --> 01:52:30.107
with some fur inside. And then--

01:52:30.107 --> 01:52:31.707
MATT: What color fur? Black as well?

01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:37.301
ASHLEY: I really wish I would've thought about this already.

01:52:37.301 --> 01:52:38.327
Yeah.

01:52:38.327 --> 01:52:39.160
MATT: Okay.

01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:43.751
ASHLEY: Yeah, black fur, and... no, let's go white.

01:52:43.751 --> 01:52:44.797
Go white.

01:52:44.797 --> 01:52:48.577
White fur, and then in the back of the coat,

01:52:48.577 --> 01:52:51.627
I want also black embroidery on top.

01:52:51.627 --> 01:52:52.877
So you can barely see it.

01:52:54.377 --> 01:52:58.127
Like some lightning, some flowers,

01:52:58.127 --> 01:53:00.938
maybe a little white embroidery flowers.

01:53:00.938 --> 01:53:03.938
MATT: Little accents here and there.
ASHLEY: Little accents here and there.

01:53:06.597 --> 01:53:11.597
And one of those round fur hats that.

01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:15.827
SAM: Like the Russian ones?

01:53:15.827 --> 01:53:17.080
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: Fuck yeah.

01:53:17.927 --> 01:53:19.477
MATT: Very cool. Okay.

01:53:19.477 --> 01:53:20.627
ASHLEY: Hopefully I don't....

01:53:23.584 --> 01:53:24.947
Yeah. Okay. Later I'm going to be like,

01:53:24.947 --> 01:53:26.597
that's not what I wanted to wear.

01:53:27.517 --> 01:53:28.775
TALIESIN: There'll be time to alter a bit.

01:53:28.775 --> 01:53:29.747
ASHLEY: Really wish I would've checked my GM.

01:53:29.747 --> 01:53:33.317
MATT: Not too complicated.
We'll put you at 18 gold for that.

01:53:33.317 --> 01:53:38.097
ASHLEY: Okay. So I will give 50 gold.

01:53:38.097 --> 01:53:40.577
MATT: Okay. Wow.
ASHLEY: Since everybody's--

01:53:40.577 --> 01:53:43.828
MATT: Big spenders here, Mighty Nein.

01:53:43.828 --> 01:53:46.177
(laughs)

01:53:46.177 --> 01:53:47.157
Generous group!

01:53:47.157 --> 01:53:49.565
LIAM: Tailor's going to party tonight.

01:53:49.565 --> 01:53:51.590
MATT: Yeah. They're going to tell tales of this

01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:54.017
phantom group that came through out of nowhere one day

01:53:54.017 --> 01:53:57.490
and just helped them make it through the winter.

01:53:59.290 --> 01:54:00.390
Fjord, anything specific?

01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:02.124
TRAVIS: Do you have any coats?

01:54:02.124 --> 01:54:03.767
(laughter)

01:54:03.767 --> 01:54:05.457
MATT: "Yeah. There are a number of coats.

01:54:05.457 --> 01:54:06.867
"What sort of coat are you looking for?"

01:54:06.867 --> 01:54:08.337
TRAVIS: A warm one.

01:54:08.337 --> 01:54:09.866
MATT: "We have a few warm ones, yes."

01:54:09.866 --> 01:54:10.797
TRAVIS: I'll take one.

01:54:10.797 --> 01:54:12.927
MATT: "All right. That'll be five gold."

01:54:12.927 --> 01:54:14.893
TRAVIS: You got it.
MATT: "All right. Here you go."

01:54:14.893 --> 01:54:17.814
TALIESIN: It's going to be like
that time we went to Colorado and

01:54:17.814 --> 01:54:21.161
you're just going to be cold
everywhere the jacket's not covering.

01:54:21.161 --> 01:54:22.482
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:54:22.482 --> 01:54:24.428
TRAVIS: We're set. Let's rock!

01:54:25.267 --> 01:54:28.325
LAURA: I run back to the tailor's that I went to.

01:54:28.325 --> 01:54:29.750
Knock on the door.

01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:30.987
Excuse me?

01:54:30.987 --> 01:54:32.567
MATT: Already in there and he's running around,

01:54:32.567 --> 01:54:34.437
giving out orders and giving out slips to different

01:54:34.437 --> 01:54:36.447
members of the troupe to start grabbing materials.

01:54:36.447 --> 01:54:37.677
"Oh, yes, yes, hello."

01:54:37.677 --> 01:54:41.620
LAURA: Can you make me some
mittens that match my socks, please?

01:54:42.847 --> 01:54:45.397
MATT: "Yes. Do not worry, no additional charge.

01:54:45.397 --> 01:54:46.790
"We'll take care of it for you."
LAURA: Thank you.

01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:48.949
MATT: "You're welcome."
LAURA: Please make them pretty, thank you.

01:54:48.949 --> 01:54:52.860
MATT: "All right, thank you. Someone lock the door."

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:53.818
TRAVIS: Lock the door.

01:54:54.081 --> 01:54:55.591
MATT: All right.

01:54:55.591 --> 01:54:57.941
As you are finishing your research, by the way,

01:54:58.991 --> 01:55:02.551
you do close the tome, sit there,

01:55:02.551 --> 01:55:03.791
taking in a bit of the information,

01:55:03.791 --> 01:55:05.591
some of it familiar, some of it new.

01:55:06.701 --> 01:55:08.641
A little frustrated that there's just a general lack

01:55:08.641 --> 01:55:12.281
of detailed information within the central archive

01:55:12.281 --> 01:55:15.431
of Rexxentrum on Aeor,

01:55:16.406 --> 01:55:17.664
when you feel a presence come up,

01:55:17.664 --> 01:55:20.921
and there you turn and you see Yudala Fon approaching

01:55:20.921 --> 01:55:24.161
with two of the regular archivists,

01:55:24.161 --> 01:55:27.701
and as they approach and stand there over you,

01:55:27.701 --> 01:55:29.546
"Hello, Beauregard.

01:55:30.693 --> 01:55:32.241
"Do not mean to disturb you."

01:55:32.241 --> 01:55:33.074
MARISHA: No.

01:55:33.074 --> 01:55:34.511
I mean, it's a little unnerving when, like,

01:55:34.511 --> 01:55:36.689
I'm sitting and all three of you are standing.

01:55:36.689 --> 01:55:39.007
I should-- I stand.

01:55:39.901 --> 01:55:40.884
MATT: "Very well.

01:55:42.181 --> 01:55:45.471
"We've done quite an extensive sweep

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:47.629
"of the archives we have here,

01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:50.711
"as well as put out some feelers

01:55:50.711 --> 01:55:55.253
"in other connected archives searching for this...

01:55:56.341 --> 01:55:59.574
"Eyes of Nine you had spoke of.

01:56:01.071 --> 01:56:02.129
"Nothing."

01:56:08.214 --> 01:56:09.047
MARISHA: Really?

01:56:09.047 --> 01:56:11.731
MATT: "Is there any other details you could perhaps provide?

01:56:13.721 --> 01:56:15.071
"Another name, or--?

01:56:18.621 --> 01:56:21.429
"Perhaps confirm with your sources

01:56:21.429 --> 01:56:24.212
"what this may have been,

01:56:25.561 --> 01:56:28.241
"but we do not have anything," and you watch

01:56:28.241 --> 01:56:30.841
as they put their hand out, and

01:56:30.841 --> 01:56:34.249
gesturing to the thousands and thousands

01:56:34.249 --> 01:56:35.915
and thousands of tomes.
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I see.

01:56:35.915 --> 01:56:37.531
I know, I've seen the books,

01:56:37.531 --> 01:56:39.333
I've been here, yeah, I get it.

01:56:39.333 --> 01:56:40.434
I get the scope.

01:56:42.371 --> 01:56:43.204
Yeah.

01:56:44.781 --> 01:56:45.614
Okay.

01:56:47.741 --> 01:56:48.771
Can I get back to you?

01:56:48.771 --> 01:56:50.421
Let me think on this for a minute.

01:56:50.421 --> 01:56:52.021
MATT: "Of course."

01:56:52.021 --> 01:56:53.370
MARISHA: Okay.

01:56:53.370 --> 01:56:54.821
MATT: They turn around and make their way

01:56:54.821 --> 01:56:56.134
to the rest of the library.

01:56:56.134 --> 01:56:59.518
MARISHA: Fucking irritated, just toss a book that I have.

01:56:59.518 --> 01:57:00.880
MATT: Yudala stops.

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:03.701
MARISHA: Huh?
ASHLEY: Are they lying?

01:57:03.701 --> 01:57:04.534
MARISHA: Lying?

01:57:04.534 --> 01:57:08.625
Oh, I mean, yeah, insight check, as they walk away?

01:57:08.625 --> 01:57:09.791
(laughter)

01:57:09.791 --> 01:57:11.961
MATT: Roll an insight check.
MARISHA: It seem like they were lying?

01:57:11.961 --> 01:57:13.741
MATT: Roll an insight check.

01:57:15.231 --> 01:57:17.009
MARISHA: Oh, pooper.

01:57:17.009 --> 01:57:17.971
That's not good.

01:57:20.378 --> 01:57:21.431
15.

01:57:21.431 --> 01:57:22.264
MATT: 15.

01:57:24.218 --> 01:57:27.001
Yudala seems pretty straightforward.

01:57:27.001 --> 01:57:29.246
The times that you have encountered and what you've heard,

01:57:29.246 --> 01:57:32.619
Yudala is one of the paragons of the archives.

01:57:37.151 --> 01:57:38.961
They seem trustworthy.

01:57:38.961 --> 01:57:39.794
TALIESIN: Hmm.

01:57:42.681 --> 01:57:44.331
MARISHA: Okay, I just kind of like--

01:57:45.351 --> 01:57:47.304
Seems hard to believe, but okay.

01:57:49.531 --> 01:57:50.651
Yeah.

01:57:50.651 --> 01:57:51.484
MATT: Okay.

01:57:52.871 --> 01:57:55.061
Anything else anyone needs to accomplish

01:57:55.061 --> 01:57:58.991
in your shopping day here in Rexxentrum?

01:57:58.991 --> 01:58:02.264
LIAM: No, but when I return to Beauregard:

01:58:05.571 --> 01:58:08.091
You know, I meant to read with you.

01:58:08.091 --> 01:58:11.741
I got a little caught up in errands.

01:58:11.741 --> 01:58:12.688
MARISHA: Yeah, don't worry about it.

01:58:12.688 --> 01:58:17.241
LIAM: I'm feeling a little anxious, a little too anxious,

01:58:17.241 --> 01:58:20.354
if you can believe it, to do heavy reading.
MARISHA: You?

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:23.531
LIAM: Today.
MARISHA: Oh, actually, that is surprising.

01:58:23.531 --> 01:58:25.511
I was being sarcastic, but that is a little surprising.

01:58:25.511 --> 01:58:26.884
LIAM: Let's go get lunch.

01:58:28.201 --> 01:58:29.541
I could listen to you.

01:58:29.541 --> 01:58:30.791
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll fill you in.

01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:36.751
I just rip a page out of my notebook in anger.

01:58:36.751 --> 01:58:38.651
MATT: Okay. (chuckles)

01:58:38.651 --> 01:58:40.468
LIAM: You need beer and a pretzel, come on.

01:58:40.468 --> 01:58:41.888
MARISHA: Okay.

01:58:41.888 --> 01:58:43.586
MATT: All right. So you guys go ahead and find the--

01:58:43.586 --> 01:58:45.801
LIAM: Find a place, sit at an outside table,

01:58:45.801 --> 01:58:50.358
and then if she's willing to share, pump her mind

01:58:50.358 --> 01:58:52.101
for all the information she got

01:58:52.101 --> 01:58:54.401
and totally nerd out over it.

01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:56.331
MATT: You got it.
LIAM: Rather than trying to focus on a book,

01:58:56.331 --> 01:58:58.631
which I would have a hard time doing right now.

01:58:58.631 --> 01:58:59.881
MATT: Okay.

01:58:59.881 --> 01:59:00.714
All right.

01:59:01.888 --> 01:59:02.721
Anything else?

01:59:02.721 --> 01:59:03.838
MARISHA: I tell him everything.

01:59:03.838 --> 01:59:06.343
And then also I'd fill him in about

01:59:06.343 --> 01:59:08.761
Yudala came back, and they said

01:59:08.761 --> 01:59:11.719
that they couldn't find anything about the Eyes of Nine.

01:59:11.719 --> 01:59:13.427
Fucking anything!

01:59:14.731 --> 01:59:16.581
They were like, "Oh, do you, like--

01:59:16.581 --> 01:59:18.791
"can you check with your sources

01:59:18.791 --> 01:59:21.424
"and maybe find--" I'm like, bitch, I'm the source.

01:59:21.424 --> 01:59:23.715
I didn't say that, but I did think it in my head.

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:28.002
LIAM: That thing you think as
you walk down the stairs, <i>ja</i>?

01:59:30.403 --> 01:59:34.866
Well, maybe it was...

01:59:34.866 --> 01:59:39.009
just smoke and not fire.

01:59:39.009 --> 01:59:40.224
Maybe it was--

01:59:41.851 --> 01:59:44.414
Maybe we're seeing meaning where there is none,

01:59:45.301 --> 01:59:47.971
or maybe it is the key to everything, I don't know.

01:59:51.753 --> 01:59:52.645
Think about it.

01:59:52.645 --> 01:59:53.704
MARISHA: Keep your ears open.

01:59:53.704 --> 01:59:55.251
Just need more answers.

01:59:55.251 --> 01:59:57.071
LIAM: We can come back later in the week, yeah?

01:59:57.071 --> 01:59:58.387
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Keep thinking.

01:59:58.387 --> 01:59:59.220
MARISHA: Okay.

02:00:02.121 --> 02:00:03.281
MATT: All right.

02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:04.904
Any other business during the day?

02:00:07.771 --> 02:00:08.604
All right.

02:00:08.604 --> 02:00:12.161
I'll take that as a sign that as the sun begins to set

02:00:12.161 --> 02:00:17.161
across the Zemnian sky, you all gather...

02:00:17.678 --> 02:00:20.381
wearing what attire?

02:00:20.381 --> 02:00:22.241
SAM: We brought our fancies.
LAURA: Our fancy.

02:00:22.241 --> 02:00:24.006
MATT: So you're going full formal on this, okay.

02:00:24.006 --> 02:00:25.152
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

02:00:25.152 --> 02:00:27.531
ASHLEY: Oh, the fancies that we wore to--

02:00:27.531 --> 02:00:29.227
LIAM: The ball.
SAM: The ball.

02:00:29.227 --> 02:00:30.531
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. That velvet dress.

02:00:30.531 --> 02:00:32.901
LAURA: Yeah, but, like, a little bit of armor still.

02:00:32.901 --> 02:00:34.759
MARISHA: Yeah, I keep on my bracers--
LAURA: Just in casies.

02:00:34.759 --> 02:00:36.182
MARISHA: -- and I bring my staff.

02:00:36.182 --> 02:00:37.771
MATT: Okay.

02:00:37.771 --> 02:00:38.614
All right.

02:00:40.131 --> 02:00:42.851
Gathering and making your way to the familiar Shimmer Ward

02:00:42.851 --> 02:00:47.851
of Rexxentrum, as the darkened sky

02:00:48.191 --> 02:00:51.411
takes the horizon from the sunlight,

02:00:51.411 --> 02:00:54.111
and you can see from the breaks in the cloud cover

02:00:54.111 --> 02:00:56.034
bits of starlight peeking through,

02:00:57.081 --> 02:01:01.214
you eventually make your way to a familiar place to you.

02:01:03.031 --> 02:01:06.731
You come to the second southernmost tower of the Candles

02:01:06.731 --> 02:01:10.494
on the southern-eastern side of the Shimmer Ward.

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:14.211
And you stand now before the dark iron gate

02:01:14.211 --> 02:01:17.121
that is dwarfed by the multi-spired structure

02:01:17.121 --> 02:01:20.081
of brass and ruddy brick that rises

02:01:20.081 --> 02:01:21.861
like a twisting monolithic tree

02:01:21.861 --> 02:01:24.321
from a courtyard dense with oaks.

02:01:25.221 --> 02:01:28.021
This is the estate grounds known as the Ambition's Call.

02:01:29.521 --> 02:01:34.274
And the gates open for you as you stand there.

02:01:36.091 --> 02:01:36.931
That's where we're going to take a break.

02:01:36.931 --> 02:01:39.073
TRAVIS: Ooh.
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:01:39.073 --> 02:01:40.146
TRAVIS: Ambition's Call?

02:01:40.146 --> 02:01:41.725
MATT: Ambition's Call.

02:01:41.725 --> 02:01:44.204
SAM: Number four Privet Drive.

02:01:46.071 --> 02:01:48.551
LAURA: It's a tower?
TRAVIS: Lord of the Rings reference.

02:01:48.551 --> 02:01:50.031
LAURA: Out of the oak trees?
MATT: Correct.

02:01:50.031 --> 02:01:51.841
There's a courtyard of oak trees.

02:01:51.841 --> 02:01:53.981
On the corner of this, on the opposite end,

02:01:53.981 --> 02:01:57.161
there is an entrance that leads to where Astrid was staying,

02:01:57.161 --> 02:01:59.451
where you went and visited last time

02:01:59.451 --> 02:02:01.101
you were here in Rexxentrum.

02:02:03.238 --> 02:02:04.071
But yes.

02:02:05.256 --> 02:02:06.106
So.

02:02:06.106 --> 02:02:07.819
SAM: Dinner.
MATT: Indeed.

02:02:07.819 --> 02:02:08.869
We're going to take a little break here.

02:02:08.869 --> 02:02:12.001
We'll be back here shortly to pick up wherever this goes.

02:02:12.001 --> 02:02:14.254
So see you here in a few minutes.

02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:18.001
Now experience the ultimate way to play,

02:02:18.001 --> 02:02:20.507
by sitting at a table with your friends,

02:02:20.507 --> 02:02:23.257
with your face in a screen

02:02:23.257 --> 02:02:24.009
Progress!

02:02:24.009 --> 02:02:26.259
D&amp;D Beyond

02:02:26.259 --> 02:02:30.267
Log in to explore strange worlds
and fantastial cities

02:02:30.267 --> 02:02:33.016
thanks to a company based in a
really boring one.

02:02:33.016 --> 02:02:36.269
that handles all the tedious
math and reference stuff for you

02:02:36.269 --> 02:02:41.524
so you can finally unleash the epic quest you've
been crafting since middle school on your friends.

02:02:41.524 --> 02:02:44.028
Or just do what
most people use it for

02:02:44.028 --> 02:02:46.782
breaking out endless new
characters while their bored at work

02:02:46.782 --> 02:02:52.791
I could just finish these spreadsheets,
but what if this Paladin owned a horse?

02:02:52.791 --> 02:02:54.789
Perfect!

02:02:55.041 --> 02:02:57.041
D&amp;D Beyond
Play with advantage.

02:02:59.545 --> 02:03:05.542
Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here!
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop!

02:03:06.043 --> 02:03:10.545
Ooh! Look at this!
Look at the details! Ooh!

02:03:12.792 --> 02:03:15.559
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:03:17.058 --> 02:03:19.557
You're only like 5 clicks
away from owning this

02:03:19.557 --> 02:03:22.361
Maybe more, if you have
a lot of windows open

02:03:22.385 --> 02:03:24.570
on your browser.  I
don't know your life.

02:03:25.567 --> 02:03:32.572
Darling, I recommend buying two.  One for
you and another for you.  Let's be honest.

02:03:35.073 --> 02:03:40.081
This is a lot of stuff you guys.  We
have like so many cool things right now!

02:03:41.581 --> 02:03:47.993
All of this and more now
available in the Critical Role Shop!

02:03:49.088 --> 02:03:51.849
Brian: Hey gang!
Laura: Hey

02:03:55.598 --> 02:03:56.602
Brian: I recently went through a move,
[Laugh] very recently.

02:03:56.602 --> 02:03:59.102
Dani: To a new car?
Brian: Yeah from one car to another.

02:03:59.102 --> 02:04:08.105
I went from a '96 baby blue Ford Bronco....

02:04:08.105 --> 02:04:15.105
to a '97 baby blue
Laura: Ford Bronco

02:04:15.105 --> 02:04:18.855
Brian: What's the Chevy version of the Bronco?
[Laughter]

02:04:18.855 --> 02:04:21.799
Dani: Fell apart right
before the finish line.

02:04:20.605 --> 02:04:27.133
Brian: What's the Chevy version of the Bronco?
Where's my fiance knows more about cars than I do?

02:04:27.133 --> 02:04:28.387
Laura: I don't know

02:04:28.387 --> 02:04:29.387
Matt: That was very sad, continue.

02:04:29.387 --> 02:04:32.385
Laura: That was a sad moment,
I'm glad we all witnessed it.

02:04:40.647 --> 02:04:45.131
(upbeat jazz music)

02:04:45.131 --> 02:04:46.551
MARISHA: Hello everyone.

02:04:46.551 --> 02:04:48.921 line:20%
It's me, Marisha Ray,

02:04:48.921 --> 02:04:51.731 line:20%
Creative Director for Critical Role content.

02:04:51.731 --> 02:04:53.811 line:20%
And I want to take a moment to speak from the heart

02:04:53.811 --> 02:04:56.921 line:20%
about how much we appreciate your support.

02:04:56.921 --> 02:05:01.187
No frills, no crazy gags, just honesty.

02:05:01.187 --> 02:05:02.395
Over the past five years,

02:05:02.395 --> 02:05:05.121
we've made a lot of ridiculous promos

02:05:05.121 --> 02:05:08.512
in an attempt to earn your subscription here on Twitch.

02:05:08.512 --> 02:05:12.081
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor, cheap costumes,

02:05:12.081 --> 02:05:14.206
and putting our loyal employees

02:05:14.206 --> 02:05:17.160
in slightly embarrassing situations eagerly hoping

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:19.611
that we've captured your attention.

02:05:19.611 --> 02:05:23.141
Today, I am not resorting to edgelord jokes

02:05:23.141 --> 02:05:25.493
written by Brian W. Foster.

02:05:25.493 --> 02:05:28.348
Or dressing Sam as a celebrity to recreate

02:05:28.348 --> 02:05:31.399
an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

02:05:31.399 --> 02:05:34.571
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch Prime account

02:05:34.571 --> 02:05:37.022
requires you to re-subscribe each month.

02:05:37.022 --> 02:05:40.731
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag

02:05:40.731 --> 02:05:42.791
or have to put Matt in cosplay

02:05:42.791 --> 02:05:45.372
to tell you that you can easily give subscriptions

02:05:45.372 --> 02:05:48.041
to fellow critters if you're feeling generous.

02:05:48.041 --> 02:05:51.670
I mean, hell, I've consumed entire production days

02:05:51.670 --> 02:05:55.391
shooting complicated parody promos featuring Taliesin Jaffe

02:05:55.391 --> 02:05:59.291
as a vintage spooky boy in full monochromatic glory

02:05:59.291 --> 02:06:04.271
all in the hope that your smile may turn into a sub.

02:06:04.271 --> 02:06:06.421
But not today.

02:06:06.421 --> 02:06:08.411 line:20%
No weird graphics.

02:06:08.411 --> 02:06:10.048 line:20%
No puppet murder.

02:06:11.131 --> 02:06:12.696
No Sam Riegel.

02:06:16.101 --> 02:06:18.181
It's just me,

02:06:18.181 --> 02:06:19.339
here to say:

02:06:20.241 --> 02:06:21.416
thank you.

02:06:22.261 --> 02:06:23.344
Love you all.

02:06:24.761 --> 02:06:26.735
Good night. (kiss)

02:06:26.735 --> 02:06:29.435
(upbeat jazz music)

02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:42.153
MATT: Welcome back.

02:18:43.010 --> 02:18:48.010
So. The gates (creaking)

02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:49.203
open before you.

02:18:50.470 --> 02:18:52.473
The courtyard, leading to the tower.

02:18:54.750 --> 02:18:57.810
As you walk through, it's a beautiful,

02:18:57.810 --> 02:19:02.050
if slightly ominous, patch of forest surrounding this tower.

02:19:02.050 --> 02:19:05.250
You can see faint fire bugs glowing

02:19:05.250 --> 02:19:06.950
and fading in and out in the distance,

02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:10.380
but just far enough out of reach,

02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:12.833
as you walk this paved path that leads through.

02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:17.870
Eventually, you find yourself to the base of the tower

02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:21.450
where this massive set of arched double doors

02:19:21.450 --> 02:19:25.713
that wait for you open into a low-lit antechamber.

02:19:29.564 --> 02:19:34.150
As you walk into the tower chamber proper,

02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:38.600
you are met with a patterned carpet of dark brown and red

02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:40.550
that meets wall to wall.

02:19:40.550 --> 02:19:43.991
No furniture, just an open entry.

02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:47.510
You can see a beautiful crystal chandelier

02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:49.100
that hangs above you in the center

02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:51.540
of the partially domed ceiling.

02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:53.910
You can see intricately carved wooden panels

02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:57.880
wrap around the doorless walls, aside from the entryway,

02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:01.881
housing large paintings set within elaborate frames.

02:20:01.881 --> 02:20:05.750
You can see one large landscape that shows an odd sunrise,

02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:09.750
it seems, over a desolate plain of rock and flame,

02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:12.653
a sky of burning clouds and haze.

02:20:13.650 --> 02:20:16.483
Anyone here who is trained in arcana, if you'd like to roll?

02:20:20.650 --> 02:20:22.700
LIAM: 15.
MATT: 15?

02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:24.580
That's enough to know this is most likely

02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:27.263
a portrait of the Plane of Fire.

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:31.630
You do also see a bloodied battlefield,

02:20:31.630 --> 02:20:35.540
a very elaborate, extensive, wide, 12-foot portrait

02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:38.720
that is curved in the way it's set

02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:40.800
against the curved interior of this chamber,

02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:43.590
where you see soldiers of two sides

02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:48.323
just clashing and tangling, in this display of violence.

02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:52.470
If anyone here has History they're proficient with,

02:20:52.470 --> 02:20:54.270
they can go ahead and roll for that.

02:20:58.920 --> 02:20:59.940
MARISHA: 31.

02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:01.506
SAM: Ooh! Damn.
LAURA: Whoa!

02:21:01.506 --> 02:21:02.664
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise.

02:21:04.090 --> 02:21:06.720
MATT: This is a depiction of the Marrow War,

02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:08.640
which was the battle--
SAM: Marijuana?

02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:12.230
MATT: The Marrow War, where the Dwendalian Empire

02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:14.026
clashed with the Julous Dominion,

02:21:14.026 --> 02:21:18.190
defeated, and then took over the entirety of this area

02:21:18.190 --> 02:21:20.573
of Western Wynandir, this great valley here.

02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:24.013
Well done.

02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:27.170
And you come across a portrait

02:21:27.170 --> 02:21:31.000
of a young man in a forest green, gold-trimmed robe

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.300
on display.

02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:35.160
You see his long dark hair comes to a widow's peak

02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:38.263
to the front of his face, right over his gray-blue eyes.

02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:41.000
You take a moment to recognize,

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.250
but this image does appear to be of a young Trent Ikithon.

02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:51.560
Not but a moment later do you make this beat of recognition

02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:53.462
then you swear you see the man in the painting

02:21:53.462 --> 02:21:54.550
give you a subtle nod.

02:21:57.100 --> 02:22:00.400
TRAVIS: Can I use See Invisibility for the next hour?

02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:02.266
Just because fuck it, why not?

02:22:02.266 --> 02:22:03.099
MATT: Sure.

02:22:04.110 --> 02:22:08.719
You put it on right as the doors close behind you.

02:22:09.730 --> 02:22:11.190
You're now enclosed in this chamber.

02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:12.720
There are no stairs.

02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:14.840
There's no other exit door.

02:22:14.840 --> 02:22:18.370
LAURA: Can I look towards the bottoms

02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:19.953
or anything of the paintings?

02:22:19.953 --> 02:22:22.030
I want to see if they have any signatures on them

02:22:22.030 --> 02:22:24.240
of painters that I would recognize,

02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.680
some of them that I studied.

02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:26.980
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:29.843
LAURA: Guidance.

02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:35.943
Cool. (laughs, blows raspberry)

02:22:40.917 --> 02:22:42.409
Nine.

02:22:42.409 --> 02:22:43.380
TRAVIS: <i>Nein</i>?

02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:44.620
MATT: They're very detailed.

02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:46.710
It's hard to pick out where a signature would be.

02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:47.770
If there is one, if it's hidden,

02:22:47.770 --> 02:22:51.240
if it's folded within the actual gold framing,

02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:52.480
or you're just not picking up on it,

02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:53.977
but nothing jumps out to you, unfortunately.

02:22:53.977 --> 02:22:56.060
LAURA: As I get back to the Trent painting,

02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:00.180
I'm going to touch his face.

02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:01.013
MATT: Okay.

02:23:02.310 --> 02:23:05.613
You can feel the texture of canvas beneath your finger.

02:23:06.750 --> 02:23:10.160
Not but a handful of moments since the front doors closed,

02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:13.870
and at this moment, the rest of you feel

02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:16.830
this shift, and you look at the carpet

02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:20.460
in the center of the room, and there is a forceful glow

02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:22.063
from underneath in places.

02:23:24.250 --> 02:23:28.490
And you see this faint pattern

02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:32.520
of various glyphs that are gently muted by the presence

02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:35.590
of the carpet over whatever the source is,

02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:38.850
light up in a circular pattern around the interior

02:23:38.850 --> 02:23:40.116
of the chamber.

02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:47.440
You then watch as the paintings begin to drift downward.

02:23:47.813 --> 02:23:48.680
TRAVIS: Dope.

02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:51.256
TALIESIN: Is this haunted room actually--

02:23:51.256 --> 02:23:52.837
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: (laughs)

02:23:52.837 --> 02:23:53.778
This is not stretching.

02:23:53.778 --> 02:23:56.110
TALIESIN: Damn. My imagination.

02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:58.570
MATT: But it begins to rise rapidly.

02:23:58.570 --> 02:24:01.010
You watch as a door goes (whoosh),

02:24:01.010 --> 02:24:02.247
another door goes (whooshing).

02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.330
Floor after floor goes by.

02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:08.620
Four, five floors, you lose count

02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:10.338
as they go (rapid whooshing).

02:24:10.338 --> 02:24:12.870
Then it quickly drifts to a stop to the point

02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:15.116
where you all find your feet lift off the ground

02:24:15.116 --> 02:24:17.160
for just a second and you find yourself clambering

02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:19.110
just to make sure you don't tumble over

02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:21.857
when the floor comes to a stop.

02:24:21.857 --> 02:24:23.440
LAURA: So it felt like we were going down?

02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:24.700
MATT: Felt like you you're going upward.

02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:25.900
LAURA: So wouldn't we have--

02:24:28.663 --> 02:24:30.300
We stop?
TRAVIS: You go (whoosh).

02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:33.160
LAURA: You go up when you're going down, you go huh!

02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:34.610
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

02:24:35.717 --> 02:24:36.550
MATT: Physics!

02:24:38.877 --> 02:24:40.520
SAM: It's been a while since we've been in an elevator.

02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:41.888
LAURA: Been anywhere.

02:24:41.888 --> 02:24:43.733
MATT: Yeah, it's true. It's very true.

02:24:43.733 --> 02:24:46.657
TRAVIS: That's right, you jump up. Whoa!
TALIESIN: How does up and down work?

02:24:46.657 --> 02:24:47.782
LAURA: Yeah, okay, cool.

02:24:47.782 --> 02:24:49.860
Then I jump at the top.
MATT: Okay.

02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:51.663
You get a good extra foot, foot and a half

02:24:51.663 --> 02:24:53.750
of leap in the air.
TALIESIN: High five.

02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:56.520
MATT: You can almost touch the bottom of the chandelier,

02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:59.050
the chandelier that does not shake or move with the momentum

02:24:59.050 --> 02:25:01.409
of the chamber.
SAM: Ooh.

02:25:01.409 --> 02:25:03.134
MATT: As it stops and lands, you look around you.

02:25:03.134 --> 02:25:06.276
You've seen no windows at all in your progression,

02:25:06.276 --> 02:25:07.589
but you do see--

02:25:07.589 --> 02:25:09.822
MARISHA and MATT: No windows and no doors.

02:25:09.822 --> 02:25:11.681
MATT: There is actually a door to the other chamber.

02:25:11.681 --> 02:25:12.514
MARISHA: Aww.
TALIESIN: Don't worry.

02:25:12.514 --> 02:25:14.330
(laughter)

02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:17.314
MATT: You see a birchwood door
on the opposite side of the room

02:25:17.314 --> 02:25:19.260
from where the entranceway would've been

02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:20.690
at the bottom of the tower.

02:25:20.690 --> 02:25:22.570
LAURA: Do you think this happened
because I touched his face?

02:25:22.570 --> 02:25:23.940
Do you think it took us to him?

02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:25.280
Like, what if I would have touched

02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:27.240
the Fire Plane picture or something?

02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:28.223
SAM: We would've gone somewhere else.

02:25:28.223 --> 02:25:29.300
We would have gone down.

02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:31.500
LIAM: Go down, hell goes down, you go down to hell.

02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:32.790
LAURA: Wow.

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:34.650
Glad I touched him, then.
SAM: Yeah.

02:25:34.650 --> 02:25:35.510
Always touch him.

02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:39.573
MATT: The birchwood door (creaking) opens,

02:25:39.573 --> 02:25:42.500
and you can see a little bit of flickering light

02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:44.781
on the inside of the chamber beyond.

02:25:44.781 --> 02:25:48.218
TRAVIS: Any Unseen Servants, any
spheres in the air or anything?

02:25:48.218 --> 02:25:49.650
MATT: In this room?

02:25:49.650 --> 02:25:51.200
No.

02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:53.722
As you, if you-- do you approach?
LIAM: I start to walk in.

02:25:53.722 --> 02:25:56.170
LAURA: Wait, wait, Caleb.

02:25:56.170 --> 02:25:57.820
LIAM: I stop in the door.

02:25:57.820 --> 02:25:59.340
LAURA: Wait.

02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:01.753
Shouldn't we have had a code word or something?

02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:07.190
TRAVIS: Let's discuss it now, while we're in earshot.

02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:09.230
TALIESIN: How about "Oh no, it's a trap"?

02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:10.880
LAURA: Okay. That sounds good.

02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:11.713
SAM: Great.

02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:15.682
LIAM: The code word is Yahtzee.

02:26:15.682 --> 02:26:20.283
(laughter)

02:26:20.283 --> 02:26:22.311
SAM: Pick a non-copywritten--

02:26:22.311 --> 02:26:24.773
(laughter)

02:26:24.773 --> 02:26:26.875
MARISHA: I don't know, Solitaire.
SAM: Pinochle or something?

02:26:26.875 --> 02:26:28.114
LIAM: No--
MARISHA: Old Maid.

02:26:28.114 --> 02:26:32.090
LIAM: -- it's the theater union, IATSE, Yahtzee.

02:26:32.090 --> 02:26:34.000
ASHLEY: IATSE.
MARISHA: Hmm.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.809
LIAM: That's also problematic.

02:26:35.809 --> 02:26:38.860
(laughter)

02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:40.551
MATT: Damn it, Liam.
SAM: Teamsters!

02:26:41.899 --> 02:26:44.405
TRAVIS: Don't fuck with the teamsters.

02:26:44.405 --> 02:26:45.238
MATT: Okay.

02:26:47.050 --> 02:26:51.162
You can hear very, very gentle violin and harpsichord music

02:26:51.162 --> 02:26:52.195
You can hear very, very gentle violin and harpsichord music

02:26:52.195 --> 02:26:54.108
playing from inside the next room.

02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:57.950
As you begin to approach, you peek beyond the threshold,

02:26:57.950 --> 02:27:01.300
and you can see, giving off a very faint aura,

02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:06.300
six different humanoid-ish figures

02:27:06.310 --> 02:27:08.220
that stand at the ready

02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:12.771
against two walls of a long, hall-like room.

02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:18.910
As you step through the door, they all disappear,

02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:23.370
and you feel the enchantment that your weapon

02:27:23.370 --> 02:27:25.423
had given to you fade.

02:27:26.564 --> 02:27:27.397
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:30.990
MATT: As you all step through, you can see now

02:27:30.990 --> 02:27:35.990
there are a number of smaller, more metallic

02:27:36.330 --> 02:27:38.940
iron chandeliers, about four of them,

02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:43.360
that align the ceiling of this long, hall-like room

02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:47.040
where you can see a long table sits before you

02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:50.640
with these kind of

02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:55.530
pale, tan, beige-colored tablecloths,

02:27:55.530 --> 02:27:59.535
and settings and chairs for seven guests.

02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:04.630
There are windows in this room, and they appear

02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:06.890
to be somewhat frosted, but you can see beyond them

02:28:06.890 --> 02:28:11.141
what looks to be a beautiful forest.

02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:15.080
Dense in trees, a bit of moonlight

02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:17.565
coming through the branches.

02:28:17.565 --> 02:28:21.970
It doesn't quite match with the math of where you are

02:28:21.970 --> 02:28:23.370
with the center of the city.

02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:27.290
Beyond the end of this table,

02:28:27.290 --> 02:28:29.390
you can see there is a roaring fireplace

02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:31.040
on the opposite side of the room,

02:28:32.370 --> 02:28:34.300
and there framed in the flickering flames

02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:36.123
you can see three figures standing,

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.483
as they all turn.

02:28:41.850 --> 02:28:43.491
You can see

02:28:45.250 --> 02:28:48.291
the figure familiar to you all first

02:28:48.291 --> 02:28:52.533
is the wide-shouldered, short dark hair,

02:28:55.097 --> 02:28:57.220
well-buttoned velvet tunic

02:28:57.220 --> 02:29:01.250
on Eadwulf, who had met you once at

02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:03.220
the Vergesson Sanatorium, when you were inspecting

02:29:03.220 --> 02:29:06.021
the beacon a number of weeks back.

02:29:07.530 --> 02:29:10.590
On the right side, you can see a woman

02:29:10.590 --> 02:29:15.313
with dirty blonde hair, short in the back,

02:29:16.390 --> 02:29:18.443
combed over to one side of the face,

02:29:20.930 --> 02:29:25.514
smiling in a very, very officious looking suit,

02:29:25.514 --> 02:29:26.347
smiling in a very, very officious looking suit,

02:29:26.347 --> 02:29:29.923
it seems that comes into a

02:29:29.923 --> 02:29:33.553
long dress at the bottom.

02:29:33.553 --> 02:29:37.611
And in the center you see a...

02:29:39.410 --> 02:29:44.068
not quite the same, but mirrored essence

02:29:44.068 --> 02:29:45.960
of that same green and gold robe

02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:47.710
that you saw in the portrait below.

02:29:48.810 --> 02:29:53.810
You see the older, jaundiced figure

02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:56.443
of Master Trent Ikithon.

02:29:57.461 --> 02:30:00.663
Who smiles, puts his arms up.

02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:07.159
"I'm so very happy that you've accepted my invitation.

02:30:07.159 --> 02:30:08.840
"I'm so very happy that you've accepted my invitation.

02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:10.506
"Please sit.

02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:14.252
"I believe we have much to talk about."

02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:19.890
MARISHA: Question, you said there were only place settings

02:30:19.890 --> 02:30:21.600
for seven people?

02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:24.350
MATT: For the seven of you at the table.

02:30:24.350 --> 02:30:25.183
MARISHA: As well as--

02:30:25.183 --> 02:30:27.044
MATT: As well as the three for them.

02:30:27.044 --> 02:30:28.786
LAURA: Do we have assigned seating?

02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:33.231
MATT: There does not appear to be any sort of indication

02:30:33.231 --> 02:30:34.595
of assigned seating.

02:30:35.442 --> 02:30:37.870
SAM: Are you going to take the head of the table?

02:30:37.870 --> 02:30:39.080
LAURA: Yeah.

02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:41.524
MATT: Okay, Jester takes the opposite head of the table.

02:30:41.524 --> 02:30:42.570
(laughter)

02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:45.060
Of which Trent takes the furthest side.

02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:46.270
TRAVIS: The corners of the room where there were

02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:48.180
those six humanoid figures.

02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:49.350
Nothing there, right?

02:30:49.350 --> 02:30:50.183
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Empty.

02:30:50.183 --> 02:30:51.074
MATT: Yeah.

02:30:51.074 --> 02:30:52.360
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:57.100
LIAM: I'll wait until Astrid sits and then

02:30:57.100 --> 02:30:58.938
sit in a chair adjacent.

02:31:00.220 --> 02:31:02.580
MATT: So that would be-- at the opposite head of the table,

02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:06.430
Trent, to the left of Trent is Astrid,

02:31:06.430 --> 02:31:08.060
and then it would be you.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:09.002
MATT: Okay.

02:31:09.002 --> 02:31:11.920
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit across
from you, wherever you sit.

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:13.960
LAURA: Somebody should sit next to them

02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:16.640
so the Eadwulf gets separated.

02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:18.556
ASHLEY: Ooh, that's a good idea.

02:31:20.210 --> 02:31:23.000
SAM: I use my speed to try to sit

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.887
where Eadwulf would be seated.

02:31:25.887 --> 02:31:30.872
MATT: He is moving for the chair
to the right of Trent Ikithon.

02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:34.400
TRAVIS: Come on, roll for that shit.
MARISHA: Do it.

02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:39.371
LIAM: Yahtzee.

02:31:39.371 --> 02:31:40.204
TRAVIS: He has to roll dexterity?

02:31:40.204 --> 02:31:41.899
MATT: Roll a dexterity check, because this is--

02:31:41.899 --> 02:31:42.840
SAM: I don't even have my dice out.

02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:45.540
LAURA: It's like-- he's just pulling out the seat for me.

02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:46.900
TRAVIS: What do you mean you don't have your dice out?

02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:48.250
We're going to die any second!

02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:50.900
SAM: What is it am I checking?

02:31:50.900 --> 02:31:52.530
MATT: Just roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

02:31:52.530 --> 02:31:53.470
SAM: 17.

02:31:53.470 --> 02:31:54.520
MATT: 17.

02:31:55.860 --> 02:31:59.620
You watch this as he goes and pulls the chair out

02:31:59.620 --> 02:32:03.022
and is about to lean in and (sh-boof).

02:32:05.516 --> 02:32:06.837
SAM: Is this seat taken?

02:32:06.837 --> 02:32:08.338
MATT: (as Eadwulf) "Apparently it is."

02:32:08.338 --> 02:32:10.070
LAURA: (chuckles)
MATT: (creaking sound)

02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:12.596
And shoves you into the table a little bit.

02:32:12.596 --> 02:32:15.350
(laughter)

02:32:15.350 --> 02:32:19.128
MATT: Pulls the chair right next
to you back, and then sits down.

02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:21.610
ASHLEY: I'll sit down.

02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:23.068
MATT: In the chair that he pulls back?

02:32:23.068 --> 02:32:25.977
(laughter)

02:32:25.977 --> 02:32:28.021
TALIESIN: Power move!
ASHLEY: Thank you very much.

02:32:28.021 --> 02:32:29.350
MARISHA: Yes!

02:32:29.350 --> 02:32:30.491
MATT: "Of course."

02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:33.523
Kind of gently pushes it in.

02:32:34.570 --> 02:32:35.913
Looks back to you again.

02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:38.430
Goes to the third chair.

02:32:38.430 --> 02:32:42.180
LIAM: Caleb is watching, like, a mixture of mortification

02:32:42.180 --> 02:32:45.390
and hilarity, but, like, not smiling.

02:32:45.390 --> 02:32:46.440
Just...

02:32:47.692 --> 02:32:50.760
LAURA: Eadwulf, wouldn't you like to sit down next to me?

02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:52.052
TALIESIN: I walk to the chair.

02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:54.750
MATT: You walk to the chair.

02:32:54.750 --> 02:32:55.760
TALIESIN: I pull it out.

02:32:57.070 --> 02:32:58.000
For you.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.250
SAM: Oh!

02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:02.230
MATT: "Thank you."

02:33:03.335 --> 02:33:05.408
And he sits down.
MARISHA: Pull it out.

02:33:05.408 --> 02:33:06.990
(laughter)

02:33:06.990 --> 02:33:08.607
TALIESIN: Just wanted to make...
TRAVIS: (boof)

02:33:08.607 --> 02:33:10.089
(gasps, yells)

02:33:10.089 --> 02:33:12.417
TALIESIN: (whoosh) Ha ha ha. Run!

02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:15.725
MARISHA: I sit across from Caduceus.

02:33:15.725 --> 02:33:18.258
TALIESIN: Yeah, so we have eyes on either side of the--

02:33:18.258 --> 02:33:19.425
MARISHA: Good call.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:33:20.430 --> 02:33:22.630
MATT: As everyone takes their seat and finishes,

02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:26.920
Trent, who's leaning back in this high-backed chair

02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:29.770
that comes up to these hook-like hands

02:33:29.770 --> 02:33:33.320
that are currently reaching over the top of the back,

02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:37.470
puts his arms up and (claps) gives a clap.

02:33:37.470 --> 02:33:40.018
And you feel this wind (whoosh) rush through the chamber

02:33:40.018 --> 02:33:44.031
and the doors you came through (creak, thud) close.

02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:48.443
(as Trent) "The meal will be arriving shortly.

02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:51.066
"In the interim,

02:33:52.058 --> 02:33:55.408
"I am happy to have you as guests in my home."

02:33:55.408 --> 02:33:57.465
LAURA: I can't hear you, can you speak a little louder?

02:33:57.465 --> 02:34:00.482
(laughter)

02:34:00.482 --> 02:34:02.475
I'm sorry, I'm just so far down here.

02:34:04.530 --> 02:34:06.730
MATT: He then begins to introduce.

02:34:06.730 --> 02:34:10.030
(laughter)

02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:11.320
"My companions."

02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:14.960
As he speaks, his mouth does not move any longer.

02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:18.500
Instead, the language seems to be coming from all sides

02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:20.460
directly into your mind.

02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:21.335
MARISHA: Cool.
SAM: That's cool.

02:34:21.335 --> 02:34:22.509
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:34:24.390 --> 02:34:27.032
MATT: As he just stares intently across the table.

02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:33.010
"My companions for the night, of which you are familiar.

02:34:34.470 --> 02:34:38.236
"Childhood friends of your companion,

02:34:38.236 --> 02:34:41.971
"this Caleb Widogast,

02:34:41.971 --> 02:34:44.265
"or as we've known him, Bren.

02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:47.805
"This is Astrid."

02:34:49.290 --> 02:34:50.623
Points to her.

02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:53.117
"And this is Eadwulf."

02:34:54.744 --> 02:34:55.994
And he gives a nod.

02:34:58.053 --> 02:35:00.677
"Now, I must say, I'm quite impressed

02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:03.030
"ow you all have come together

02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:05.605
"and done so much in such a short time.

02:35:07.170 --> 02:35:10.080
"What is, if I might inquire, the driving force

02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:11.707
"behind your travels?

02:35:13.192 --> 02:35:15.042
"What is your mutual goal?"

02:35:18.478 --> 02:35:23.003
SAM: Boy, that is-- that's a tricky one to start with.

02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:30.258
We are driven by many forces, but mostly justice.

02:35:31.820 --> 02:35:33.100
Right?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:35:33.100 --> 02:35:35.350
SAM: Right? Mostly justice.

02:35:35.350 --> 02:35:36.910
LIAM: I think mostly we are just trying

02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:39.928
to leave the world better than when we found it.

02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:44.160
MATT: "So we are not too different, then."

02:35:45.470 --> 02:35:49.538
SAM: Oh, you seek to change the world for the better?

02:35:50.551 --> 02:35:53.388
MATT: "Well, what is the purpose of power

02:35:53.388 --> 02:35:55.315
"if not to use it properly?"

02:35:57.180 --> 02:36:02.180
LIAM: Much for us to celebrate together at this time.

02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:03.879
MATT: "Indeed."
LIAM: We have achieved peace

02:36:03.879 --> 02:36:05.479
after so much struggle.

02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:11.748
MATT: "So."

02:36:15.020 --> 02:36:18.400
There's this pregnant pause at the table

02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:22.493
as he begins to scan across each one of you.

02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:24.770
LIAM: I'm doing the same.

02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:27.750
Can I ask what kind of vibe I'm getting

02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:29.935
from Astrid and Eadwulf?

02:36:29.935 --> 02:36:31.850
MATT: I was about to say, as soon as you're doing this,

02:36:31.850 --> 02:36:35.480
Astrid pipes up and goes, "Indeed,

02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:39.805
"it is a pleasure to meet all of these friends of... Caleb,

02:36:39.805 --> 02:36:42.522
"it is a pleasure to meet all of these friends of... Caleb,

02:36:42.522 --> 02:36:45.783
"just as it is good to see you as well, my friend,

02:36:47.838 --> 02:36:50.470
"and I'm happy to get the chance to know

02:36:50.470 --> 02:36:54.860
"those who have kept him companions and safe

02:36:54.860 --> 02:36:56.710
"in the time that we could not.

02:36:59.530 --> 02:37:01.260
"Right, Eadwulf?"

02:37:03.478 --> 02:37:07.057
(as Eadwulf) "Indeed, I have seen
some of you at the sanatorium.

02:37:08.350 --> 02:37:10.708
"Seems fate continues to draw us together.

02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:16.520
"Perhaps the Matron has plans for us together yet, huh?"

02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:20.472
LAURA: Who's the Matron?

02:37:21.390 --> 02:37:24.140
MARISHA: Is he referring to the Matron of Ravens?

02:37:29.150 --> 02:37:31.135
MATT: "And you, what are you?"

02:37:31.135 --> 02:37:35.280
You see Eadwulf gives a weird half-grin.

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:37.710
TALIESIN: Vegetarian, so I hope the meal reflects that.

02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:39.943
(laughter)

02:37:39.943 --> 02:37:41.893
MARISHA: Yes!
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:37:43.930 --> 02:37:45.198
MATT: Smile fades.

02:37:45.198 --> 02:37:47.282
(laughs)

02:37:50.528 --> 02:37:53.069
(as Trent) "Well, I guess...

02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:58.670
"Before I get too deep into my particular interests

02:37:58.670 --> 02:38:03.173
"for the night, what questions have you for me?"

02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:13.970
LIAM: Well, I am curious, now that we have reached

02:38:13.970 --> 02:38:16.621
some quiet between the two nations,

02:38:19.390 --> 02:38:23.098
seeing as how central you are

02:38:24.223 --> 02:38:26.573
to the decision making here in the Empire.

02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:30.150
What's the next step?

02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:34.450
MATT: "Well, I do apologize.

02:38:34.450 --> 02:38:37.700
"You have not been around for the full scope

02:38:37.700 --> 02:38:42.680
"of our political engine, but I do not make decisions.

02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:46.340
"I merely guide.

02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:48.890
"Offer suggestions.

02:38:51.380 --> 02:38:53.510
"As to what is next, well...

02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:57.763
"There are many paths.

02:39:01.210 --> 02:39:02.882
"Am I to know...

02:39:04.390 --> 02:39:09.380
"It seems you have fallen with Vess DeRogna, yes?"

02:39:12.310 --> 02:39:14.860
LIAM: We will be spending some
time with her, that is correct.

02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:15.693
MATT: "Mmm.

02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:19.727
"And what errands, if I might inquire,

02:39:19.727 --> 02:39:22.083
"has she procured your skills for?"

02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:24.786
LAURA: You might not.

02:39:26.970 --> 02:39:28.053
Inquire.

02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:31.850
TALIESIN: Respectfully, I feel that that information

02:39:31.850 --> 02:39:36.850
would be considered of a private nature.

02:39:37.249 --> 02:39:39.470
MATT: "Of course, of course."

02:39:40.878 --> 02:39:44.300
MARISHA: Does he feel like-- does he already know?

02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:45.963
Does he already know, he just wants to hear it from us?

02:39:45.963 --> 02:39:47.324
MATT: Make an insight check.
TALIESIN: I was going to say,

02:39:47.324 --> 02:39:50.040
my insight check is just not stopping.

02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:51.056
MATT: Yeah.

02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:57.160
MARISHA: 17.
TALIESIN: 22.

02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:58.143
MATT: 22?

02:40:02.430 --> 02:40:06.670
There isn't a lack of confidence in his inquiry,

02:40:06.670 --> 02:40:09.830
and he does not appear to be finished.

02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:13.850
As he goes, "Is she looking to perhaps drag you

02:40:13.850 --> 02:40:17.542
"to Shattengrod as glorified tomb raiders, huh?

02:40:19.499 --> 02:40:20.399
"No?

02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:26.720
"Hmm, perhaps your familiarity with Xhorhasian society

02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:30.485
"is to aid her in our acquisitions there.

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:40.186
"Or is she hoping to bring you to some place colder?"

02:40:47.908 --> 02:40:49.840
TALIESIN: Well, that is a conversation
you should have with her.

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:52.090
LAURA: I know-- as far as I know, she just wants us

02:40:52.090 --> 02:40:56.390
to hang out for intimate reasons, you know?

02:40:56.390 --> 02:40:58.251
We're all very attractive.

02:40:59.384 --> 02:41:01.173
TALIESIN: That's fair.
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:41:01.173 --> 02:41:02.732
LAURA: (laughs)

02:41:07.350 --> 02:41:08.810
TALIESIN: I feel like she should get advantage

02:41:08.810 --> 02:41:11.248
for the fact that we are very attractive.

02:41:11.248 --> 02:41:12.248
MATT: (laughs)

02:41:12.248 --> 02:41:13.081
TALIESIN: Sorry.

02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.520
LAURA: 15.

02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:17.511
MATT: Okay.

02:41:19.530 --> 02:41:24.520
"Well, wherever it is that you all intend to travel,

02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:27.403
"I hope you do so safely and without issue."

02:41:28.700 --> 02:41:29.920
LAURA: Without any tissue?

02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:31.210
SAM: Yeah, we won't need any.

02:41:31.210 --> 02:41:32.973
We're not sick or anything.

02:41:35.396 --> 02:41:37.396
MATT: "Hmm. A joke, yes."

02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:42.360
The doors enter and you watch

02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:47.360
as these platters begin to just hover in the faint breeze,

02:41:47.410 --> 02:41:51.385
held aloft on their own, (clinking)

02:41:51.385 --> 02:41:53.218
filling up the table before you.

02:41:54.890 --> 02:41:58.758
LAURA: That's cool. (applauds)

02:41:59.890 --> 02:42:02.870
MATT: As you see Eadwulf takes a scarf and

02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:06.060
tucks it into the top of his shirt,

02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:08.243
and Astrid takes and puts it in her lap.

02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:13.803
Trent leans in.

02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:20.943
"No questions, then?"

02:42:21.980 --> 02:42:23.713
LIAM: So many questions.

02:42:27.170 --> 02:42:28.262
How's the new crop?

02:42:31.450 --> 02:42:32.550
How are your children?

02:42:33.591 --> 02:42:37.586
MATT: "Well, the children are doing well.

02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:40.173
"Some more than others."

02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:44.015
LIAM: Not everyone has the stomach for it.

02:42:44.015 --> 02:42:45.265
MATT: "Hmm.

02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:48.413
"We lost a...

02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:53.096
"talented prospect not long ago."

02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:57.270
LAURA: How did you lose them?

02:42:58.510 --> 02:43:00.170
MATT: "They were captured in Rosohna."

02:43:03.152 --> 02:43:03.985
MARISHA: Oh.

02:43:06.090 --> 02:43:06.963
Blondie.

02:43:08.005 --> 02:43:08.853
LAURA: That's unfortunate.

02:43:08.853 --> 02:43:10.100
SAM: Not Blondie.

02:43:10.100 --> 02:43:12.611
LIAM: No, in the prison in Xhorhas.
SAM: The girl in the prison.

02:43:12.611 --> 02:43:13.444
LAURA: Yeah.

02:43:16.651 --> 02:43:17.950
MARISHA: What's-her-butt?

02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:20.558
LIAM: Well, the Empire will always yield up

02:43:22.691 --> 02:43:23.866
more youth.

02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:32.130
I find hope

02:43:33.121 --> 02:43:36.270
in the quiet that was achieved at sea.

02:43:36.270 --> 02:43:38.753
Maybe I'm naive. I'm sure you think so.

02:43:42.220 --> 02:43:46.580
How wonderful it would be if the two sides

02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:51.566
could approach each other with that forthrightness always.

02:43:53.950 --> 02:43:56.950
You said that you make no decisions, you only advise.

02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:58.233
A thought experiment.

02:43:58.233 --> 02:43:59.420
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

02:43:59.420 --> 02:44:03.095
LIAM: Pretend that I am King Dwendal.

02:44:03.095 --> 02:44:03.936
MATT: "Very well."

02:44:03.936 --> 02:44:05.011
LIAM: In this moment,

02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:08.673
advise me.

02:44:09.950 --> 02:44:10.783
MATT: "To?

02:44:13.430 --> 02:44:14.460
"As the king?"

02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:18.170
LIAM: In your opinion, do we keep this momentum going,

02:44:18.170 --> 02:44:23.110
or use it as a feint?

02:44:25.610 --> 02:44:28.563
And dig in harder in all the traditional ways?

02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:31.022
What is your advice?

02:44:32.506 --> 02:44:34.631
MATT: "My advice,

02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:38.689
"oh great King Dwendal,

02:44:41.900 --> 02:44:46.675
"is to use this momentum to rally the populace

02:44:46.675 --> 02:44:48.475
"is to use this momentum to rally the populace

02:44:48.475 --> 02:44:51.358
"around the idea of your benevolence

02:44:51.358 --> 02:44:56.345
"and your ability to keep them safe from outside aggression.

02:44:56.345 --> 02:44:57.178
"and your ability to keep them safe from outside aggression.

02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.933
"But to keep a very close eye in all the shaded places,

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.558
"There are so many lives and only so much land."

02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:21.110
TALIESIN: How does he do that?

02:45:22.332 --> 02:45:23.165
LAURA: Yeah, really?

02:45:23.165 --> 02:45:25.770
TALIESIN: That was literally both answers at the same time.

02:45:25.770 --> 02:45:27.200
He just said yes twice.

02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:28.233
That was amazing.

02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:31.873
Wow.

02:45:40.210 --> 02:45:43.600
LIAM: I look diagonally down at Eadwulf.

02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:50.493
Like a little more perspective, Wulf.

02:45:53.601 --> 02:45:55.199
How are things going?

02:45:58.099 --> 02:46:01.670
MATT: "Well, at the moment it is not as busy.

02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:06.630
"So I am enjoying a little more of a relaxed schedule.

02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:11.133
"You look good."

02:46:11.133 --> 02:46:13.110
LIAM: Say again?
MATT: "You look good."

02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:13.943
LIAM: Oh.

02:46:18.151 --> 02:46:18.984
Well.

02:46:20.675 --> 02:46:24.838
It's a wonder what travel will do, and sun on your back.

02:46:24.838 --> 02:46:26.150
MATT: "Hmm."

02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:29.300
SAM: When the war was a bit hotter than it is now,

02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:31.220
were you very busy?

02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:34.453
You, Wulf? Eadwulf?

02:46:36.770 --> 02:46:39.197
MATT: "Not any busier than you were, apparently."

02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:43.433
SAM: Well, yes, but were you on the front lines?

02:46:44.380 --> 02:46:46.983
MATT: "I'm not a frontline sort of fighter.

02:46:48.610 --> 02:46:53.610
"I have different skills. More of a scout, if you will."

02:46:54.041 --> 02:46:58.657
SAM: Did you go into enemy lines

02:46:58.657 --> 02:47:01.460
and go on missions and things?

02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:02.653
Exciting things?

02:47:02.653 --> 02:47:04.511
MATT: "Many exciting things."

02:47:04.511 --> 02:47:06.244
SAM: Yeah? Like what?

02:47:06.244 --> 02:47:07.976
LIAM: Yeah, I'm curious, like Veth.

02:47:07.976 --> 02:47:11.420
I missed a year or two.

02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:13.770
What have you both been filling your time with?

02:47:15.650 --> 02:47:17.900
MATT: Looks over towards Astrid, and Astrid

02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:20.326
narrows her eyes a bit

02:47:20.326 --> 02:47:22.551
and pulls her head back and he smiles.

02:47:28.125 --> 02:47:30.337
"We're doing what we do best, Bren.

02:47:33.050 --> 02:47:34.908
"Ensure history walks the right path."

02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:39.650
LAURA: Have you been taking up hairstyling?

02:47:39.650 --> 02:47:43.780
Because Astrid's got a pretty cool one.

02:47:43.780 --> 02:47:45.630
Was it Eadwulf that did that for you?

02:47:46.962 --> 02:47:48.615
MATT: You say this to Astrid?
LAURA: Uh-huh.

02:47:48.615 --> 02:47:49.573
MATT: Astrid goes,

02:47:51.891 --> 02:47:53.874
"No, this is...

02:47:55.888 --> 02:47:57.418
"This is my own design."

02:47:57.418 --> 02:47:58.629
LAURA: Oh, you did that yourself?

02:47:58.629 --> 02:48:00.310
MATT: She takes and pours a little bit of wine.

02:48:00.310 --> 02:48:02.980
"Mm-hmm."
LAURA: Wow.

02:48:02.980 --> 02:48:04.070
MATT: "Why, do you not like it?"

02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:05.053
LAURA: No, I love it.

02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:07.380
I love it.

02:48:07.380 --> 02:48:09.510
MATT: "Would you like your hair like it as well?"

02:48:10.347 --> 02:48:12.740
LAURA: That's okay. It's so original.

02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:14.660
I wouldn't want to steal your thunder.

02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:17.060
TALIESIN: Hmm. You might've chosen the wrong profession.

02:48:19.127 --> 02:48:20.637
MATT: "It's my profession that allows me to do this."

02:48:20.637 --> 02:48:22.040
And you watch as she flicks her finger

02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:24.646
and the hair suddenly grows long and curls up

02:48:24.646 --> 02:48:29.220
in this extremely bouncing, healthy,

02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:33.095
shoulder bob, and then it recoils upward into this--

02:48:33.095 --> 02:48:36.206
MARISHA: Careful, you got some
Béarnaise in a lock right there.

02:48:36.206 --> 02:48:38.502
You got a little out of control with that.

02:48:38.502 --> 02:48:40.622
TALIESIN: World could always use a barber.

02:48:40.622 --> 02:48:44.268
MARISHA: It got a little on your lapel.

02:48:44.268 --> 02:48:45.390
TALIESIN: I don't have that.

02:48:45.390 --> 02:48:46.877
LAURA: That's really cool.

02:48:46.877 --> 02:48:49.330
That's a really cool spell.

02:48:49.330 --> 02:48:51.030
That's a really cool spell.

02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.863
MATT: "Thank you."

02:48:55.137 --> 02:48:57.093
TALIESIN: Flexing a fine talent.

02:48:57.093 --> 02:48:58.524
MATT: She looks back to Bren.

02:48:58.524 --> 02:49:02.100
LAURA: Do you ever teach people
how to do those kind of spells?

02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:04.550
Because I would love to know how to do that spell.

02:49:05.630 --> 02:49:08.900
MATT: "Well, no, these are the things that are taught

02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:12.200
"after years of training at the Soltryce Academy."

02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:14.550
LAURA: Is it so you can like, change your looks?

02:49:14.550 --> 02:49:15.383
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

02:49:15.383 --> 02:49:18.580
LAURA: Because there's easy Disguise Self spells, you know.

02:49:18.580 --> 02:49:19.763
Those are, like, easy.

02:49:19.763 --> 02:49:20.840
MATT: "Yeah.

02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:23.290
"Then you know all about this sort of magic, then."

02:49:26.550 --> 02:49:27.597
LAURA: Oh.

02:49:27.597 --> 02:49:29.720
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:33.040
LAURA: Oh, I guess I could just
change my hair on a whim, huh?

02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:35.425
But that looked like you were really changing your hair.

02:49:35.425 --> 02:49:37.687
Were you really changing your hair?

02:49:37.687 --> 02:49:39.130
MATT: "Glamors."

02:49:39.130 --> 02:49:39.963
LAURA: Wow.

02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:42.953
Caleb, I went to learn about glamors.

02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:46.193
MARISHA: That's why her tits look so amazing.

02:49:51.103 --> 02:49:53.294
LAURA: We are such assholes.

02:49:53.294 --> 02:49:54.127
MATT: (laughing) You guys.

02:49:54.990 --> 02:49:57.180
LIAM: Yeah, Caleb is working real hard

02:49:57.180 --> 02:50:01.260
to keep a blush down through all of this.

02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:04.773
MATT: Astrid leans forward and goes, "So, Bren.

02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:09.858
"We miss you.

02:50:11.641 --> 02:50:13.440
"We're glad to see that you're safe

02:50:15.123 --> 02:50:16.406
"and doing so well."

02:50:19.030 --> 02:50:20.403
LIAM: I have good friends.

02:50:21.990 --> 02:50:22.990
They're good people.

02:50:28.510 --> 02:50:31.130
SAM: Are you trying to invite him back?

02:50:31.130 --> 02:50:32.400
Is that why we're here?

02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:36.530
Are you asking him back into the fold?

02:50:36.530 --> 02:50:38.670
MATT: "Oh, I'm not doing that, no."

02:50:40.176 --> 02:50:42.008
Trent leans forward in his seat and goes,

02:50:43.550 --> 02:50:48.125
"I'm more-- just wanted to express my...

02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:51.400
"pleasure with Bren's--

02:50:53.010 --> 02:50:57.953
"Caleb's advancement as the prodigy I always knew he was.

"While some students take direct tutelage and study,

"some are unique in how they best develop:

"through self-discovery,

"others inspired through hardship.

"come from those who have endured the dark

"and crawled their way back."

02:51:37.390 --> 02:51:40.783
SAM: So you're apologizing, then?

02:51:41.874 --> 02:51:44.380
MARISHA: No, it sounds like he's
trying to take fucking credit.

02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:46.530
TALIESIN: Yeah, it didn't sound like an apology to me.

02:51:48.460 --> 02:51:51.370
MATT: "Of my handful of vigilant reaches,

02:51:51.370 --> 02:51:53.350
"I've had a fondness for you three."

02:51:53.350 --> 02:51:57.483
And he gestures towards the three students.

02:51:59.865 --> 02:52:02.373
"Eadwulf and Astrid are skilled in so much.

02:52:04.330 --> 02:52:05.920
"Everything one could seemingly want

"But, and I mean this with all due respect

"to the both of them, their potential is limited.

02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:20.697
"Unlike you, Bren.

"You have the eventual makings of an

"upon you for this reason.

"Some out of curiosity, others, a threat.

02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:49.337
"Forgive me, Bren.

"I could see your gifts,

"and your faults and limitations.

"To truly grow, you needed to be broken

"and left to build yourself.

"It took longer than we anticipated,

"but when you were ready,

"we turned on the light and showed you the door."

02:53:22.367 --> 02:53:26.260
And he takes something from the side of his setting,

02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:28.870
and it drifts over across the table in your direction

02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:31.353
and lands at the front of your plate.

02:53:33.065 --> 02:53:36.518
You see a familiar symbol, that of the Arch Heart.

02:53:49.643 --> 02:53:51.713
LIAM: This is why I am not dead.

02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:56.453
MATT: "Of course.

02:54:01.400 --> 02:54:04.953
"If we wanted you dead, there would have been no escape.

02:54:09.480 --> 02:54:11.883
"And I cannot tell you how proud of you I am.

02:54:13.210 --> 02:54:14.376
"We are.

02:54:19.374 --> 02:54:22.057
"And I know you hate me, Bren.

02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:24.890
"Hate what I've put you through,

02:54:26.187 --> 02:54:28.023
"and I accept those feelings.

02:54:30.115 --> 02:54:32.806
"For it was a hard choice for me to make.

02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:40.560
"What I did, though, I did out of love."

02:54:40.724 --> 02:54:41.624
LAURA: (scoffs)

02:54:44.522 --> 02:54:45.913
LIAM: To what end?

02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:49.130
To use me?

02:54:49.130 --> 02:54:53.571
MATT: "No, to show you what you are capable of.

02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:02.950
"It was your parents' wish when I told them

02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:05.943
"of the spark that I saw within you.

02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:09.470
"They asked me to do whatever it took

02:55:09.470 --> 02:55:12.161
"to help you realize it,

02:55:12.161 --> 02:55:14.710
"for the glory of your family

02:55:14.710 --> 02:55:15.733
"and for the Empire.

02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:20.990
"I did just that, as much as it hurt to hurt you.

02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:25.500
"It is the greater man who puts

02:55:25.500 --> 02:55:27.667
"the needs of others over himself, Bren.

02:55:29.107 --> 02:55:30.690
"And this nation needs you."

02:55:32.180 --> 02:55:33.013
LAURA: Insight check.

02:55:33.013 --> 02:55:33.846
MATT: "We need you."

02:55:35.654 --> 02:55:37.041
Make an insight check.

02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:40.230
LAURA: Lying.

02:55:40.230 --> 02:55:42.560
LIAM: My eye flicks to Astrid's.

02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:44.336
LAURA: Natural fucking 20.

02:55:44.336 --> 02:55:46.346
LIAM: Ooh!

02:55:46.346 --> 02:55:47.187
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:55:47.187 --> 02:55:48.383
MATT: I'll text you real fast.

02:55:49.593 --> 02:55:51.260
MATT: (chuckles)

02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:53.560
LIAM: I would like to insight check Astrid.

02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:55.660
MATT: Go for it.
LIAM: To see if she's going along with it.

02:55:58.868 --> 02:56:00.709
Not a natural 20, but

02:56:02.492 --> 02:56:03.334
25.

02:56:03.334 --> 02:56:04.690
MATT: 25, okay.

02:56:04.690 --> 02:56:06.990
What's your total with the natural 20, Jester?

02:56:08.310 --> 02:56:09.460
LAURA: 25.

02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:11.900
MATT: Damn, look at that, two 25s.

02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:12.866
SAM: Wow.

02:56:12.866 --> 02:56:13.699
Wow.

02:56:14.617 --> 02:56:16.317
We might actually learn something.

02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:18.865
MATT: Okay, give me just a second.

02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:22.010
LAURA: Takes longer to text than it does--

02:56:22.010 --> 02:56:23.563
TRAVIS: This insight check brought to you by--

02:56:23.563 --> 02:56:27.120
SAM: This text brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:31.000
Makers of the world's finest modular gaming terrain.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.843
MATT: Oh, the curses of COVID distance.

02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:36.870
I miss the whispers, it so much easier.

02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:38.020
LIAM: 2020's hard, man.

02:56:38.020 --> 02:56:39.323
MATT: I know.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:56:39.323 --> 02:56:42.470
It's really hard to stay quiet during--

02:56:42.470 --> 02:56:43.463
MARISHA: I know!

02:56:43.463 --> 02:56:45.330
LAURA: -- his speech.
MARISHA: Ugh!

02:56:45.330 --> 02:56:47.410
SAM: Matt, you know, it would be easier and faster

02:56:47.410 --> 02:56:50.817
if you just did it with Siri with just the--

02:56:50.817 --> 02:56:52.176
MATT: You're right!

02:56:52.176 --> 02:56:53.238
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh.

02:56:53.238 --> 02:56:54.260
MATT: And I will tell this to you out loud,

02:56:54.260 --> 02:56:58.311
because this is less tricksy.

02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:04.430
With the 25, you can--

02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:08.810
She's looking towards you with

02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:16.046
a feeling of internal conflict

02:57:16.046 --> 02:57:18.054
that you weren't expecting.

02:57:18.990 --> 02:57:23.418
You can see there is a softness and a yearning,

02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:28.183
but her body language is leaning away from him.

02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:30.613
LIAM: From Trent?
MATT: From Trent.

02:57:36.410 --> 02:57:40.410
And you see a glimmer in there

02:57:40.410 --> 02:57:42.271
of the Astrid you once knew.

02:57:45.740 --> 02:57:47.740
Ever so faintly...

02:57:50.232 --> 02:57:51.065
worried.

02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:53.360
LIAM: Worried?

02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:55.560
MATT: About your response.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:57:58.520 --> 02:58:01.353
MARISHA: Is Eadwulf just chowing down on his steak?

02:58:02.683 --> 02:58:03.920
MATT: Oh, no, he's mid-chew.

02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:05.932
He's like--

02:58:05.932 --> 02:58:06.781
MARISHA: Okay.

02:58:06.781 --> 02:58:09.578
MATT: He's intently watching, and just like--

02:58:14.250 --> 02:58:16.310
LIAM: You will have to walk me through

02:58:18.132 --> 02:58:22.453
the logic of this long con.

02:58:25.050 --> 02:58:28.000
Because I do loathe you.

02:58:30.353 --> 02:58:31.486
Deeply.

02:58:32.930 --> 02:58:34.080
MATT: "Of course."

02:58:35.870 --> 02:58:39.435
LIAM: But you do nothing flagrantly.

02:58:40.690 --> 02:58:42.561
Everything is very careful.

02:58:44.095 --> 02:58:44.936
MATT: "Indeed."

02:58:44.936 --> 02:58:48.473
LIAM: So how would you hope to use me as a tool?

02:58:52.350 --> 02:58:55.477
MATT: "This isn't to use you as a tool, Bren.

02:59:06.527 --> 02:59:08.585
"And there isn't a word I could say that

02:59:08.585 --> 02:59:12.863
"would find your ears with belief.

02:59:14.530 --> 02:59:15.363
"Correct?"

02:59:19.059 --> 02:59:21.142
LIAM: Say that one more time?

02:59:21.142 --> 02:59:22.250
Because of the social distance.

02:59:22.250 --> 02:59:23.083
MATT: Yeah.

02:59:25.060 --> 02:59:27.700
"There is no phrase or words I could say

02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:30.523
"that you would find yourself able to believe."

02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:37.203
LIAM: It's hard to forget the past.

02:59:38.900 --> 02:59:40.100
MATT: "Then do not forget it.

02:59:41.570 --> 02:59:42.403
"Use it.

02:59:45.830 --> 02:59:48.323
"If I am to be the focus of your hatred,

02:59:50.140 --> 02:59:51.493
"I accepted that long ago.

02:59:54.850 --> 02:59:58.010
"But what you are now, what you've accomplished,

02:59:58.010 --> 03:00:01.583
"those you've drawn around you, and where you go.

03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:06.310
"That is because of what you've endured.

03:00:07.881 --> 03:00:11.790
"Not because of a book you read in some hall

03:00:13.770 --> 03:00:16.693
"with other sniveling, rich children.

03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:20.023
"You made yourself.

03:00:22.980 --> 03:00:24.983
"Not myself, not them.

03:00:29.290 --> 03:00:31.148
"But it took

03:00:31.148 --> 03:00:35.640
"that path of pain

03:00:37.781 --> 03:00:39.880
"to accomplish what this is.

03:00:45.577 --> 03:00:49.120
"And you're not the only one of us in the Assembly

03:00:51.710 --> 03:00:56.293
"to have been through similar trauma

03:00:56.293 --> 03:00:57.909
"and been defined by it."

03:01:03.627 --> 03:01:06.610
LIAM: I dead-eye stare Astrid

03:01:06.610 --> 03:01:08.676
while talking to Trent

03:01:10.374 --> 03:01:14.140
and say: And you think that

03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:15.973
my mother and father,

03:01:19.380 --> 03:01:21.930
our mothers and fathers and children,

03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:29.123
should serve as grist for the mill in this way?

03:01:38.130 --> 03:01:39.530
MATT: (as Astrid) "Whatever it takes

03:01:39.530 --> 03:01:44.163
"to keep the people of this Empire safe.

03:01:50.870 --> 03:01:53.620
"The wants of one do not outweigh the wants of the many.

03:01:56.954 --> 03:01:57.787
"Right?"

03:02:05.985 --> 03:02:07.635
Eadwulf leans forward and goes,

03:02:11.133 --> 03:02:13.966
"Our parents made a sacrifice, yes?

03:02:15.241 --> 03:02:17.663
"Like any soldier does in the battlefield."

03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:36.803
LIAM: If we cannot protect our own,

03:02:38.908 --> 03:02:40.783
then all of it is a failure.

03:02:47.620 --> 03:02:49.433
Why did we get into this?

03:02:50.910 --> 03:02:55.350
Why did we serve with such vigor,

03:02:59.060 --> 03:03:00.833
if not to protect.

03:03:08.220 --> 03:03:09.636
MATT: (as Trent) "You see,

03:03:12.628 --> 03:03:15.419
"when talent rises from nothing,

03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:22.113
"then nothing truly is lost.

03:03:28.980 --> 03:03:32.993
"You are far more than where you came from."

03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:46.840
LIAM: So you've sent me off like a windup clockwork toy

03:03:49.130 --> 03:03:50.751
to serve the Empire.

03:03:53.517 --> 03:03:54.608
Am I right?

03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:01.400
What if the thing to do now is to supplant you,

03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:05.393
to pull you up like a weed and do better.

03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:09.377
You comfortable with that idea?

03:04:10.873 --> 03:04:13.423
MATT: "Nothing would make me prouder."

03:04:16.623 --> 03:04:18.016
LAURA: Insight check.
MARISHA: Insight check.

03:04:18.016 --> 03:04:18.998
I know, yeah.

03:04:18.998 --> 03:04:20.374
He means it, doesn't he?

03:04:20.374 --> 03:04:21.810
Fuck, I know he means it.

03:04:21.810 --> 03:04:24.450
LIAM: I'm not even asking.

03:04:24.450 --> 03:04:26.216
MARISHA: That's great.
LAURA: Natural one.

03:04:26.216 --> 03:04:28.410
(laughter)

03:04:28.410 --> 03:04:29.490
SAM: Probably means it.

03:04:29.490 --> 03:04:30.920
TALIESIN: Got broccoli right here.
MARISHA: He means it.

03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:32.250
MATT: At this point, Jester dribbles

03:04:32.250 --> 03:04:33.083
down her chin a little bit.

03:04:33.083 --> 03:04:34.780
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

03:04:34.780 --> 03:04:36.551
I'm just-- this food looks really good.

03:04:36.551 --> 03:04:38.280
MARISHA: 15, he means it.

03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:40.730
MATT: He seems pretty honest, from what you can tell.

03:04:42.007 --> 03:04:43.421
LAURA: Beau!

03:04:43.421 --> 03:04:44.842
Beau!

03:04:44.842 --> 03:04:46.730
MARISHA: Yeah?
LAURA: Eat something already.

03:04:46.730 --> 03:04:49.200
MARISHA: I don't have a fucking appetite.

03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:50.613
He's disgusting.

03:04:54.757 --> 03:04:56.057
LIAM: Let's take it further.

03:04:57.652 --> 03:05:00.333
I look at Eadwulf and then at Astrid.

03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:05.173
When he is out of the picture

03:05:07.348 --> 03:05:09.423
and you and you and I

03:05:10.880 --> 03:05:14.046
carry the torch forward,

03:05:15.630 --> 03:05:17.405
we will mangle more children

03:05:20.979 --> 03:05:24.248
to feed the fields of Wynandir?

03:05:26.625 --> 03:05:29.253
MATT: Eadwulf sits back, crosses his arms.

03:05:30.252 --> 03:05:31.293
Looks to Astrid.

03:05:32.650 --> 03:05:34.880
Astrid looks to you and says,

03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:44.420
"Well, if you were to be

03:05:44.568 --> 03:05:46.434
"the bannerman of this tower,

03:05:48.961 --> 03:05:52.394
"that we are charged to,

03:05:52.394 --> 03:05:54.152
"then we do as you say.

03:05:57.780 --> 03:06:01.218
"If you want to bring more into this fold, we will.

03:06:02.610 --> 03:06:04.915
"If you want it to end, that's your command."

03:06:08.595 --> 03:06:11.103
LIAM: What about you, though?

03:06:11.103 --> 03:06:12.210
MATT: "What about me?"

03:06:15.970 --> 03:06:19.573
LIAM: When we spoke last, I had the impression that you

03:06:21.381 --> 03:06:25.161
were being groomed for this seat.

03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:29.640
MATT: She looks nervously over towards Trent,

03:06:30.883 --> 03:06:32.483
and Trent leans in a little bit.

03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:40.936
"My ambitions

03:06:43.895 --> 03:06:45.845
"and the paths laid before me

03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:52.697
"are not always congruent, Bren."

03:06:54.037 --> 03:06:56.780
And she looks deadly serious towards you.

03:06:56.780 --> 03:06:58.733
With a look of "<i>stop</i>."

03:07:08.100 --> 03:07:11.010
Trent leans forward with this grin,

03:07:11.010 --> 03:07:15.885
getting slowly more and more curled

03:07:15.885 --> 03:07:17.343
and confident.

03:07:19.810 --> 03:07:23.776
"Any man of my position assumes

03:07:23.776 --> 03:07:25.580
"that everyone I keep close

03:07:25.580 --> 03:07:27.923
"is just waiting for me to turn my back.

03:07:30.390 --> 03:07:33.890
"Every person in power knows that feeling,

03:07:33.890 --> 03:07:36.373
"lives by it.

03:07:40.391 --> 03:07:42.691
"It's the rare one that gets to choose.

03:07:45.500 --> 03:07:47.687
"I just hope you don't disappoint me, Bren."

03:08:01.251 --> 03:08:03.418
LIAM: That is a lot to absorb.

03:08:07.088 --> 03:08:09.724
It's been an interesting decade, to be sure.

03:08:12.900 --> 03:08:16.360
I often feel like a failure and a success

03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:17.780
within the same hour.

03:08:21.376 --> 03:08:22.560
MATT: "Then you are learning."

03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:29.148
LIAM: I have dreamed

03:08:31.015 --> 03:08:35.398
of murdering you with my bare hands many nights.

03:08:38.530 --> 03:08:40.830
So I hope it's not just flowery language

03:08:40.830 --> 03:08:45.198
you are throwing around the dinner table, Master Ikithon.

03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:54.550
This place, this country could do better.

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
It could do it with a little less blood.

03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:06.730
Everyone at this table knows that struggle

03:09:06.730 --> 03:09:08.823
is inherent to life.

03:09:15.050 --> 03:09:16.863
But this way is not the only way.

03:09:19.610 --> 03:09:22.113
That was given to Astrid.

03:09:31.029 --> 03:09:32.479
MATT: She looks at Trent.

03:09:38.119 --> 03:09:39.185
"Then,

03:09:41.589 --> 03:09:42.939
"take care of yourself,

03:09:45.759 --> 03:09:46.917
"all of you,

03:09:49.673 --> 03:09:51.584
"for the struggle never stops.

03:09:53.449 --> 03:09:55.069
"And because you don't want bloodshed,

03:09:55.069 --> 03:09:57.869
"doesn't mean every other person

03:09:57.869 --> 03:09:59.769
"that wants what you have doesn't.

03:10:06.979 --> 03:10:08.682
"History and mortal nature,

03:10:10.399 --> 03:10:12.275
"prove this time and time again.

03:10:15.709 --> 03:10:20.233
"If you are not sometimes the first to cut,

03:10:20.233 --> 03:10:22.975
"you are the first to receive the blade.

03:10:28.149 --> 03:10:31.041
"I've spent my life baring knives.

03:10:37.859 --> 03:10:41.936
"Let's hope you live as long, Caleb Widogast."

03:10:50.768 --> 03:10:53.369
MARISHA: I take a bite of my steak.

03:10:53.369 --> 03:10:54.614
Is it poisoned?

03:10:57.584 --> 03:10:58.909
MATT: It's very well prepared.

03:11:00.259 --> 03:11:01.265
MARISHA: Jester.

03:11:01.265 --> 03:11:03.709
MATT: It does not appear to be poisoned.

03:11:03.709 --> 03:11:06.589
MARISHA: It might be the best steak
I've ever had in my life.

03:11:06.589 --> 03:11:08.971
LAURA: Really?
MARISHA: It's so fucking good.

03:11:08.971 --> 03:11:11.117
It's melting in my mouth.

03:11:13.554 --> 03:11:15.453
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just eat as much as you can real fast--

03:11:15.453 --> 03:11:17.561
LAURA: Before he kicks us out?
MARISHA: Get kicked out, yeah.

03:11:20.494 --> 03:11:23.384
LIAM: I feel like I have been domineering the conversation.

03:11:23.384 --> 03:11:25.684
LAURA: What?! No!
SAM: No.

03:11:25.684 --> 03:11:28.292
LAURA: Not at all.
SAM: It's been great.

03:11:28.292 --> 03:11:32.416
LIAM: Does anyone else have any questions

03:11:32.416 --> 03:11:33.890
about me being...

03:11:35.166 --> 03:11:36.565
groomed as the antichrist?

03:11:36.565 --> 03:11:38.399
(laughter)

03:11:38.399 --> 03:11:40.390
TRAVIS: How many more beacons do you have?

03:11:40.390 --> 03:11:42.859
LAURA: (laughing into fake coughing)

03:11:42.859 --> 03:11:43.942
LIAM: There you go.

03:11:46.424 --> 03:11:48.449
MATT: "What do you mean?
You've only seen the one.

03:11:49.918 --> 03:11:51.869
"That is what we have."

03:11:51.869 --> 03:11:53.409
TALIESIN: Insight check.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:11:53.409 --> 03:11:54.509
MATT: Go for it.

03:11:55.979 --> 03:11:56.812
LIAM: Natural 20.

03:11:56.812 --> 03:11:57.756
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:11:57.756 --> 03:12:00.248
ALL: (yelling)

03:12:00.248 --> 03:12:02.979
TRAVIS: (machine whirring and firing)

03:12:02.979 --> 03:12:05.135
MATT: Bringing you to a total of...?

03:12:05.135 --> 03:12:06.698
LAURA: 40, that's 40.

03:12:06.698 --> 03:12:08.292
LIAM: Well, 29 on my end.

03:12:08.292 --> 03:12:09.622
TALIESIN: 30.

03:12:09.622 --> 03:12:12.339
MARISHA: So... 59.

03:12:12.339 --> 03:12:13.602
MATT: Well, not combined.

03:12:13.602 --> 03:12:16.079
(laughing)
SAM: Yeah, they stack. They stack.

03:12:16.079 --> 03:12:18.549
MATT: That's how it works.
ASHLEY: Yeah, you combine them now.

03:12:18.549 --> 03:12:22.789
MARISHA: How many there are, the
addresses in which they're located.

03:12:22.789 --> 03:12:23.821
TALIESIN: His eyes dart to the left.

03:12:23.821 --> 03:12:25.939
"It's due south, go!"
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:25.939 --> 03:12:27.449
MATT: Since you're both here--

03:12:27.449 --> 03:12:30.074
LIAM: It's right under the table!
LAURA: Yes!

03:12:31.129 --> 03:12:33.869
MATT: He's being completely honest.

03:12:33.869 --> 03:12:35.019
LAURA: He's always honest.

03:12:35.019 --> 03:12:37.659
MARISHA: I hate that-- the best liars are honest.

03:12:39.225 --> 03:12:42.241
TRAVIS: What's the most incredible
thing you've learned from studying them?

03:12:45.484 --> 03:12:46.718
MATT: "We don't know yet."

03:12:49.119 --> 03:12:49.952
TRAVIS: Yet?

03:12:51.289 --> 03:12:53.689
TALIESIN: Have you ever answered a question directly?

03:12:56.989 --> 03:12:59.449
MATT: "One question at a time."

03:12:59.449 --> 03:13:00.679
TALIESIN: I knew it.

03:13:00.679 --> 03:13:01.512
That's great.

03:13:03.770 --> 03:13:05.796
LAURA: It's like a party game, really.

03:13:07.059 --> 03:13:08.539
MATT: "We have learned some things,

03:13:08.539 --> 03:13:10.781
"but there is still much more to glean.

03:13:10.781 --> 03:13:13.479
"We have only just begun our research.

03:13:13.479 --> 03:13:17.184
"So who's to say what the most important thing is.

03:13:18.799 --> 03:13:23.189
"What I do know there is much potential to help a lot

03:13:23.189 --> 03:13:24.465
"of good people."

03:13:32.599 --> 03:13:36.806
MARISHA: You mentioned being a tomb raider in Shattengrod.

03:13:36.806 --> 03:13:39.011
Is that a mission you've sent people on?

03:13:39.011 --> 03:13:40.509
MATT: "No, but it sounds like the sort of thing

03:13:40.509 --> 03:13:43.049
"that Vess would definitely go for."

03:13:43.049 --> 03:13:44.629
MARISHA: Interesting.

03:13:44.629 --> 03:13:49.249
MATT: "Her interests tend to lie in things

03:13:49.249 --> 03:13:51.609
"around the forgotten history."

03:13:51.609 --> 03:13:53.899
MARISHA: Isn't that kind of like her title?

03:13:53.899 --> 03:13:55.069
MATT: She's the Archmage of Antiquity.

03:13:55.069 --> 03:13:56.924
MARISHA: Yeah, that's her thing. Right?

03:13:56.924 --> 03:13:58.593
That's, like, what she's supposed to do?

03:13:58.593 --> 03:13:59.893
TALIESIN: It's, like, in the name.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:14:03.499 --> 03:14:07.369
MARISHA: Have you come across any interesting artifacts?

03:14:07.369 --> 03:14:08.202
MATT: "In my life?"

03:14:08.202 --> 03:14:10.209
MARISHA: Things she's dug up recently?

03:14:10.209 --> 03:14:13.919
Anything pre-Calamity sound familiar?

03:14:13.919 --> 03:14:17.164
Anything related to the Eyes of Nine?

03:14:18.589 --> 03:14:22.029
MATT: "I have not, but if you've seen such a thing,

03:14:22.029 --> 03:14:23.639
"please do tell me.

03:14:23.639 --> 03:14:27.039
"Vess tends to be very secretive with her business."

03:14:27.039 --> 03:14:28.906
MARISHA: Oh, this has nothing to do with her.

03:14:30.969 --> 03:14:33.279
This is something we've all been, like,

03:14:33.279 --> 03:14:35.497
like a side hobby, you know.

03:14:38.459 --> 03:14:42.187
MATT: "I do not believe I have,

03:14:42.187 --> 03:14:43.753
"but I am curious."
MARISHA: Have a side hobby?

03:14:43.753 --> 03:14:45.611
You should have a side hobby.

03:14:45.611 --> 03:14:47.559
MATT: "-- heard anything about this artifact

03:14:47.559 --> 03:14:51.011
"or Eyes of Nine you speak of."

03:14:51.011 --> 03:14:52.959
MARISHA: Worth a shot.

03:14:52.959 --> 03:14:56.819
Origami is very-- you know, you could probably--

03:14:56.819 --> 03:14:59.249
the mental health aspect of just having something

03:14:59.249 --> 03:15:03.169
that's not intrinsically related to your work, you know.

03:15:03.169 --> 03:15:05.029
You should-- you should get a hobby.

03:15:05.029 --> 03:15:06.179
LIAM: He has a hobby.

03:15:07.559 --> 03:15:08.867
He's a sculptor.

03:15:11.926 --> 03:15:13.067
MATT: "In a way."

03:15:16.869 --> 03:15:18.861
TRAVIS: The trees outside your windows.

03:15:20.799 --> 03:15:22.199
What is that supposed to be?

03:15:23.529 --> 03:15:25.829
MATT: "I just wanted to provide a...

03:15:27.645 --> 03:15:29.259
"gentle atmosphere.

03:15:29.259 --> 03:15:32.239
Do you not like it?
I can change it for you.

03:15:32.239 --> 03:15:33.159
TRAVIS: I would love that.

03:15:33.159 --> 03:15:35.999
LAURA: Ooh!
MATT: "What would you prefer?"

03:15:35.999 --> 03:15:37.272
TRAVIS: Coastal view.

03:15:38.189 --> 03:15:40.949
MATT: Without him moving or even looking away,

03:15:40.949 --> 03:15:43.189
you watch as all the windows shift

03:15:43.189 --> 03:15:46.679
into a moonlit oceanside night

03:15:46.679 --> 03:15:48.719
and you can see waves just breaking

03:15:48.719 --> 03:15:52.579
against the sides of the ocean beaches.

03:15:52.579 --> 03:15:56.439
LAURA: Is it ocean on both sides or is it ocean on one side?

03:15:56.439 --> 03:15:58.733
MATT: It looks like it's ocean
on one side and then it curves around

03:15:58.733 --> 03:16:00.561
and you begin to see the coast on the other.

03:16:00.561 --> 03:16:02.865
LAURA: Cool.
MATT: Like you're right on a cliff.

03:16:02.865 --> 03:16:05.515
TRAVIS: Dope, dope, dee-dope.
LAURA: That's neat.

03:16:05.515 --> 03:16:07.216
MATT: "Any other parlor tricks you would wish

03:16:07.216 --> 03:16:10.736
"to ask of an archmage of the Cerberus Assembly?"

03:16:10.736 --> 03:16:13.389
SAM: Nope, no parlor tricks, but I had actually a question.

03:16:13.389 --> 03:16:17.949
If you don't mind, Caleb, about your past.

03:16:18.899 --> 03:16:22.589
You know, thank you so much for sending him

03:16:22.589 --> 03:16:25.142
to us in your weird psycho way.

03:16:25.989 --> 03:16:29.005
But we do appreciate making his acquaintance,

03:16:29.005 --> 03:16:34.005
however dark and creepy the origins were.

03:16:34.179 --> 03:16:38.020
But you know, you-- I think if

03:16:38.020 --> 03:16:40.859
my memory serves, he was sort of locked up,

03:16:40.859 --> 03:16:45.062
locked away for a while in a pla-- in a bad place.

03:16:46.149 --> 03:16:47.889
He would have stayed there forever, right

03:16:47.889 --> 03:16:50.742
if someone hadn't freed him?

03:16:51.689 --> 03:16:53.029
MATT: "Most likely, yes."

03:16:53.029 --> 03:16:54.267
SAM: Who freed him?

03:16:55.339 --> 03:16:56.430
MATT: "Well,

03:16:57.291 --> 03:16:58.765
"who do you think freed him?"

03:16:58.765 --> 03:17:00.398
And he gestures over towards the symbol

03:17:00.398 --> 03:17:03.007
on the table that was given to Caleb earlier.

03:17:07.609 --> 03:17:08.442
SAM: What?

03:17:12.114 --> 03:17:16.029
LIAM: What he's saying saying is that he orchestrated it.

03:17:16.029 --> 03:17:18.363
LAURA: So he imprisoned you <i>and</i> he freed you.

03:17:18.363 --> 03:17:20.030
LIAM: He left me shut off

03:17:20.030 --> 03:17:23.162
and then he turned the lights back on.

03:17:24.929 --> 03:17:27.060
LAURA: Wow.
SAM: It's weird.

03:17:27.060 --> 03:17:29.682
LAURA: That's very kind of you.

03:17:29.682 --> 03:17:31.290
MATT: "Thank you."
LAURA: Mm.

03:17:33.369 --> 03:17:34.650
Very generous.

03:17:38.959 --> 03:17:40.789
LIAM: Didn't need those 10 years.

03:17:41.999 --> 03:17:43.859
How is this going?

03:17:49.223 --> 03:17:50.348
MATT: "Eadwulf."

03:17:52.951 --> 03:17:55.201
Eadwulf leans back,

03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:59.485
pulls back his sleeves and you can see

03:17:59.485 --> 03:18:04.118
the clustered maze-like tattoos
that are across his forearms.

03:18:05.149 --> 03:18:08.479
And you can see similar scars as to the ones that Caleb had

03:18:08.479 --> 03:18:11.349
with raised areas of the skin,

03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:15.357
where things are embedded beneath and have healed over.

03:18:16.857 --> 03:18:18.507
And he goes,

03:18:18.507 --> 03:18:20.915
"It's come in quite handy, to be honest.

03:18:21.899 --> 03:18:22.991
LAURA: Does that hurt?

03:18:24.378 --> 03:18:25.711
MATT: "Only a little, at the beginning.

03:18:27.239 --> 03:18:30.884
"But it much more hurts the person on the other side."

03:18:30.884 --> 03:18:33.539
And he tenses his arms and as he does,

03:18:33.539 --> 03:18:37.612
you see energy spark through and arc up the arm.

03:18:38.979 --> 03:18:41.680
LAURA: You're like a living magical weapon?

03:18:45.299 --> 03:18:46.739
MATT: "I like that title.

03:18:46.739 --> 03:18:48.939
"Living magical weapon."

03:18:48.939 --> 03:18:52.289
MATT: Are his forearms still as amazing as they always were?

03:18:52.289 --> 03:18:53.819
MATT: Yeah, they're more so.

03:18:53.819 --> 03:18:55.700
More so. He's a fit fucker.

03:18:55.700 --> 03:18:56.533
LIAM: Yeah.

03:18:59.152 --> 03:19:01.285
MATT: He takes a little drink and...

03:19:02.635 --> 03:19:03.918
nods to you.

03:19:05.249 --> 03:19:07.732
LIAM: I look over at Astrid.
What about you?

03:19:11.069 --> 03:19:14.390
MATT: "They have come in handy a number of times, yes.

03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:19.519
"But do I require to give a presentation as well?"

03:19:19.519 --> 03:19:22.219
She pulls her sleeves back and shows the same tattoos.

03:19:27.259 --> 03:19:31.279
TRAVIS: You've talked about Caleb replacing you.

03:19:31.279 --> 03:19:33.919
Forgive me, I am so forgetful.

03:19:33.919 --> 03:19:34.939
What's wrong with you?

03:19:34.939 --> 03:19:35.939
Where are you going?

03:19:40.369 --> 03:19:42.310
MATT: "Well, nowhere, if he fails."

03:19:45.899 --> 03:19:47.109
TRAVIS: Nowhere?

03:19:47.109 --> 03:19:48.972
You don't feel ill?

03:19:54.139 --> 03:19:57.291
MATT: "I take it from the tone of your inquiry

03:19:58.519 --> 03:20:01.519
"that you don't seem to understand the...

03:20:03.235 --> 03:20:05.849
"structure of the Cerberus Assembly."

03:20:05.849 --> 03:20:07.079
TRAVIS: I don't.

03:20:07.079 --> 03:20:09.079
Although I did look up to it when I was younger.

03:20:09.079 --> 03:20:10.359
I was very curious.

03:20:10.359 --> 03:20:13.067
I'm sad to report I haven't learned much since then.

03:20:15.909 --> 03:20:19.864
MATT: "Membership is only given
when a member has stepped down,

03:20:19.864 --> 03:20:21.939
"kicked out or passes away."

03:20:25.039 --> 03:20:29.269
TRAVIS: And do you plan to step down, get kicked out or...

03:20:32.277 --> 03:20:33.605
MATT: "Hopefully, not any.

03:20:35.389 --> 03:20:36.872
"I like where I am.

03:20:38.579 --> 03:20:40.784
"It has served me well for a very long time.

03:20:46.509 --> 03:20:48.657
LIAM: It's a very generous offer.

03:20:50.049 --> 03:20:52.874
I take it very seriously, truly.

03:20:57.229 --> 03:20:58.942
What if I decide to walk away?

03:21:00.269 --> 03:21:04.312
What if I want to be a sailor instead?

03:21:05.403 --> 03:21:06.586
MATT: "That is your choice."

03:21:08.019 --> 03:21:09.179
LIAM: Easy as that?

03:21:09.179 --> 03:21:10.395
MATT: "Of course.

03:21:12.849 --> 03:21:14.090
"But you won't."

03:21:21.969 --> 03:21:22.802
LIAM: No.

03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:25.939
No, I won't be a sailor.

03:21:31.189 --> 03:21:33.682
TALIESIN: What a shame, you make a fine sailor.

03:21:33.682 --> 03:21:35.188
SAM: He really does not.

03:21:35.188 --> 03:21:36.242
TALIESIN: The world would lose one.

03:21:36.242 --> 03:21:37.875
SAM: Terrible at sailing!

03:21:40.979 --> 03:21:42.629
LIAM: This has been very informative.

03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:45.062
Illuminating.

03:21:47.889 --> 03:21:49.889
I don't wish to overstay our welcome.

03:21:49.889 --> 03:21:52.326
We do have business to attend to

03:21:52.326 --> 03:21:54.192
and preparations to make.

03:21:54.192 --> 03:21:55.233
LAURA: Mm-hm.

03:21:56.169 --> 03:21:59.632
MATT: "Well, regardless, it has been
a pleasure to get to see all of you.

03:21:59.632 --> 03:22:03.872
"Thank you for accepting our invitation and for this...

03:22:04.839 --> 03:22:06.709
"quaint bit of conversation."

03:22:06.709 --> 03:22:08.379
LAURA: Thank you for the delicious steak.

03:22:08.379 --> 03:22:12.341
It was really one of the best I've ever had.

03:22:12.341 --> 03:22:16.975
MATT: "Well, I will let the staff know posthaste.

03:22:18.999 --> 03:22:20.107
"Thank you.

03:22:21.289 --> 03:22:22.820
"I will take my leave."

03:22:23.809 --> 03:22:25.292
TALIESIN: May I say, before you go:

03:22:27.719 --> 03:22:32.599
I think perhaps you are one of the most powerful mages

03:22:32.599 --> 03:22:36.442
that I've ever had the pleasure to be in the presence of.

03:22:38.369 --> 03:22:42.101
And for this, I would offer a gift.

03:22:42.101 --> 03:22:46.259
I think it has been a long time since anyone has pointed out

03:22:46.259 --> 03:22:48.059
to you that you're a fool.

03:22:49.509 --> 03:22:51.059
Pain doesn't make people,

03:22:52.299 --> 03:22:54.769
it's love that makes people.

03:22:54.769 --> 03:22:56.742
The pain is inconsequential.

03:22:57.879 --> 03:23:00.109
It's love that saves them.

03:23:00.109 --> 03:23:01.919
And you would know that, but you have none around you.

03:23:01.919 --> 03:23:03.149
You said so yourself,

03:23:03.149 --> 03:23:06.494
you surround yourself with lies and deceptions.

03:23:06.494 --> 03:23:09.352
And I wish for you, in the future,

03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:12.892
to find someone who will mourn you when you are gone.

03:23:15.779 --> 03:23:17.012
Respectfully.

03:23:23.929 --> 03:23:24.970
MATT: "Good night."

03:23:26.392 --> 03:23:27.640
And he vanishes.

03:23:28.623 --> 03:23:31.760
MARISHA: (whispers) Caduceus.
TALIESIN: That was so tasty.

03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:34.094
LAURA: Ooh!
MATT: Astrid and Eadwulf are just like--

03:23:35.134 --> 03:23:37.679
TRAVIS: Yo.
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

03:23:37.679 --> 03:23:39.304
LAURA: Wow!
MARISHA: Cad burn.

03:23:39.304 --> 03:23:41.904
MATT: Eadwulf takes his napkin--

03:23:42.960 --> 03:23:43.793
"Um--"

03:23:44.923 --> 03:23:47.384
LAURA: You guys want to hang out or something?
You want to go grab a drink?

03:23:47.384 --> 03:23:49.617
LIAM: I was to ask the same thing.

03:23:49.617 --> 03:23:51.209
Why don't we get out of here?

03:23:51.209 --> 03:23:53.634
MATT: "No, I have--

03:23:53.634 --> 03:23:56.689
"I have some business I have to attend to."
LAURA: Come on! Hang out with us!

03:23:56.689 --> 03:23:58.059
MATT: "Mm."

03:23:58.059 --> 03:24:00.149
TALIESIN: The invitation's always open.

03:24:00.149 --> 03:24:04.049
MATT: And he begins to leave
the chamber as Astrid stands up.

03:24:04.049 --> 03:24:07.089
LIAM: What if you just walked us
a block or two away from the tower?

03:24:07.089 --> 03:24:08.247
TALIESIN: Please.

03:24:10.119 --> 03:24:12.002
LAURA: It'll be fun.
MATT: He looks back at Astrid.

03:24:16.043 --> 03:24:18.619
MATT: "We'll walk you beyond the courtyard, yes?"

03:24:18.619 --> 03:24:19.777
LIAM: Astrid.

03:24:22.679 --> 03:24:25.117
MATT: "Just to make sure you
safely make it off the grounds."

03:24:28.845 --> 03:24:32.129
And they escort you back to the central chamber.

03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:36.902
Proceed down to the base of the tower.

03:24:39.659 --> 03:24:41.642
You do not jump this time because that would hurt.

03:24:44.459 --> 03:24:46.799
LAURA: I bend my knees so they're like (exclaims).

03:24:49.089 --> 03:24:50.489
MATT: The door is opened and they lead you

03:24:50.489 --> 03:24:52.597
back into the courtyard and you step out.

03:24:52.597 --> 03:24:55.672
You can hear the crickets in the nearby oak trees

03:24:55.672 --> 03:24:57.122
making their evening noise.

03:24:57.122 --> 03:25:01.088
LAURA: I want to thread my arm
through Astrid's as we're walking.

03:25:01.088 --> 03:25:02.369
MATT: She tenses a bit.

03:25:02.369 --> 03:25:05.383
You hear the owl nearby going-- (hooting)

03:25:06.227 --> 03:25:07.573
You all continue to walk.

03:25:07.573 --> 03:25:10.309
(laughter)

03:25:10.309 --> 03:25:11.359
LIAM: Reflex.

03:25:14.819 --> 03:25:17.269
LAURA: I'm going to whisper over to her as we're walking.

03:25:18.569 --> 03:25:21.986
I'm sorry if you thought I
was giving you a hard time earlier.

03:25:23.245 --> 03:25:26.059
I thought maybe you were really mean like Trent,

03:25:26.059 --> 03:25:28.219
but now I'm feeling really guilty about it

03:25:28.219 --> 03:25:30.129
because I don't think you are.

03:25:30.129 --> 03:25:33.929
So I want to apologize if I came across as rude.

03:25:33.929 --> 03:25:35.982
I feel very bad about it.

03:25:37.479 --> 03:25:40.839
MATT: She doesn't necessarily lean back,

03:25:40.839 --> 03:25:43.869
but then speaks quietly towards your direction.

03:25:43.869 --> 03:25:45.979
"You don't know anything about me."

03:25:45.979 --> 03:25:47.629
LAURA: No.

03:25:47.629 --> 03:25:49.779
MATT: "You do not know what I've done."

03:25:49.779 --> 03:25:52.569
LAURA: Well, I know some of what you've done,

03:25:52.569 --> 03:25:54.719
and I know that Caleb cares deeply for you,

03:25:54.719 --> 03:25:57.434
so you can't be all bad.

03:26:02.379 --> 03:26:03.537
MATT: No response.

03:26:06.860 --> 03:26:08.479
You watch as Eadwulf

03:26:08.479 --> 03:26:10.269
as he's walking along flicks his wrist,

03:26:10.269 --> 03:26:13.069
and you watch as he pulls out of the air

03:26:13.069 --> 03:26:15.637
a bottle of some sort of a dark liquor

03:26:15.637 --> 03:26:19.187
and he uncorks it, takes a swig.

03:26:21.029 --> 03:26:22.756
ASHLEY: That's a handy trick.

03:26:22.756 --> 03:26:25.056
MATT: "Oh, I've got plenty of them, don't worry."

03:26:26.069 --> 03:26:27.559
ASHLEY: I'd love to see more.

03:26:27.559 --> 03:26:29.449
MATT: "Would you?"

03:26:29.449 --> 03:26:30.282
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:26:31.659 --> 03:26:33.509
LIAM: I pass the bottle over to Astrid.

03:26:33.509 --> 03:26:34.459
MATT: Okay.

03:26:40.299 --> 03:26:43.662
MATT: Hands it over to Eadwulf, takes it, corks it,

03:26:45.506 --> 03:26:46.739
and it vanishes.

03:26:49.999 --> 03:26:51.249
LIAM: You could come with us.

03:26:52.865 --> 03:26:54.972
You <i>could</i>, you could.

03:26:54.972 --> 03:26:56.267
MATT: "No, I could not."

03:27:00.735 --> 03:27:02.510
LIAM: Well...

03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:05.194
maybe we both have some thinking to do.

03:27:09.109 --> 03:27:09.942
MATT: "Maybe."

03:27:12.855 --> 03:27:15.377
LAURA: Are you talking to Astrid or Eadwulf at this point?

03:27:15.377 --> 03:27:16.945
LIAM: Sure.
MATT: He's talking to Astrid.

03:27:16.945 --> 03:27:19.462
LAURA: Okay. Just making sure.

03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:28.591
LIAM: We'll be out of the city soon.

03:27:28.591 --> 03:27:30.166
I don't know when we'll be back.

03:27:34.689 --> 03:27:35.904
MATT: "Just be careful.

03:27:37.249 --> 03:27:39.229
"I'm sorry I can't be of more help."

03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:41.399
Her eyes dart up

03:27:41.399 --> 03:27:44.601
towards the trees above, you hear again the--

03:27:44.601 --> 03:27:47.057
(hooting)

03:27:48.449 --> 03:27:52.007
LAURA: Oh, he's-- he's an owl now, I get it.

03:27:54.203 --> 03:27:56.972
SAM: We can kidnap you, make it look like a real struggle.

03:27:58.450 --> 03:28:00.700
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:28:01.709 --> 03:28:03.659
MATT: She actually smiles at that and goes,

03:28:07.899 --> 03:28:09.720
"I appreciate the candor."

03:28:10.959 --> 03:28:15.349
As you guys reach the gates that lead off the estate itself

03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:16.872
Eadwulf pushes it open.

03:28:20.289 --> 03:28:23.222
"That was certainly one of the
more interesting dinners I've been to.

03:28:28.048 --> 03:28:29.019
"I like you."

03:28:29.019 --> 03:28:30.419
TALIESIN: Thank you, I like you, too.

03:28:33.659 --> 03:28:36.259
Don't let that stuff get to your head.

03:28:36.259 --> 03:28:39.631
He's-- that guy's a little-- oof.
MATT: "Yeah."

03:28:39.631 --> 03:28:41.698
(laughter)

03:28:42.679 --> 03:28:45.481
MATT: "I would be careful not to
say things to people like him."

03:28:45.481 --> 03:28:47.681
TALIESIN: Oh no, I wouldn't if I had to live here, no.

03:28:51.777 --> 03:28:52.759
Woof.

03:28:52.759 --> 03:28:54.167
MARISHA: "If I had to live here."

03:28:57.379 --> 03:28:58.212
MATT: "Anyway."

03:28:59.094 --> 03:29:00.582
You see that he's about to say
something to Caduceus and he,

03:29:00.582 --> 03:29:02.782
"Anyway.

03:29:02.782 --> 03:29:04.552
"Astrid."
LIAM: Good spending time.

03:29:06.209 --> 03:29:08.459
"I'm sure we'll cross paths again,"

03:29:08.459 --> 03:29:10.609
and he puts his hand on your shoulder.

03:29:12.999 --> 03:29:15.099
"She keeps bringing us together."

03:29:21.512 --> 03:29:22.969
And he walks on.

03:29:22.969 --> 03:29:27.689
LIAM: Does he have any marks of the Matron on him anywhere?

03:29:27.689 --> 03:29:31.109
MATT: Passive perception on Caleb, no marks on him,

03:29:31.109 --> 03:29:33.454
but you do catch as he was leaning forward,

03:29:33.454 --> 03:29:35.696
touching your shoulder, there is a flash of a

03:29:35.696 --> 03:29:40.360
small, silver pendant of a raven feather.

03:29:42.679 --> 03:29:43.979
LIAM: There's your multiclass.

03:29:49.119 --> 03:29:51.629
MATT: Astrid lingers for a moment.

03:29:51.629 --> 03:29:53.289
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh!

03:29:53.289 --> 03:29:54.849
I'm going to use Disguise Self,

03:29:54.849 --> 03:29:58.425
and I'm going to make my hair very long,
about down to here.

03:29:58.425 --> 03:30:00.789
(laughter)

03:30:00.789 --> 03:30:02.684
MATT: "See, you can do it.

03:30:02.684 --> 03:30:04.386
"There's no worries to have."

03:30:04.386 --> 03:30:06.089
LAURA: It's pretty great, yeah,

03:30:06.089 --> 03:30:08.176
but I want to be able to do like, you know,

03:30:08.176 --> 03:30:10.382
and actually make it move.

03:30:10.382 --> 03:30:12.779
MATT: "Well, give it time."

03:30:12.779 --> 03:30:13.612
LAURA: Okay.

03:30:17.009 --> 03:30:19.732
MARISHA: You sure you don't want to come
get a drink with us?

03:30:20.619 --> 03:30:25.412
Now that the walking road pylon has left.

03:30:30.585 --> 03:30:32.285
MATT: "I appreciate the offer.

03:30:34.851 --> 03:30:36.384
"But I should not."

03:30:39.249 --> 03:30:42.408
TRAVIS: Funny that he let Caleb go and not you.

03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:46.245
Strange, don't you think?
MATT: "Hm?"

03:30:47.414 --> 03:30:52.047
TRAVIS: Isn't it funny that he let Caleb go and not you?

03:30:54.719 --> 03:30:55.902
Seems...

03:30:57.319 --> 03:30:58.152
odd.

03:30:59.039 --> 03:31:02.220
MATT: "Caleb was always his favorite. Bren."

03:31:08.279 --> 03:31:09.487
LIAM: (unaccented) Well...

03:31:11.129 --> 03:31:12.845
you were always mine.

03:31:17.149 --> 03:31:19.565
MATT: (unaccented) "You mean what you said in there, right?

03:31:23.319 --> 03:31:24.152
"To stop him."

03:31:26.401 --> 03:31:27.619
LIAM: I cannot hear.
MATT: Sorry.

03:31:27.619 --> 03:31:28.752
LIAM: I'm sorry.

03:31:29.799 --> 03:31:32.647
MATT: "You mean what you said in there, to stop him?"

03:31:39.399 --> 03:31:40.474
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

03:31:41.707 --> 03:31:43.919
Nothing is set in stone.

03:31:43.919 --> 03:31:45.695
Not for you or anyone.

03:31:51.269 --> 03:31:52.719
MATT: "Race you to the top."

03:31:54.019 --> 03:31:57.025
And she turns and heads back into the courtyard.

03:32:05.934 --> 03:32:07.684
LAURA: Are you okay, Caleb?

03:32:09.749 --> 03:32:12.032
MARISHA: Let's-- let's get away from here.

03:32:13.919 --> 03:32:15.511
Let's get a little bit away.

03:32:17.679 --> 03:32:19.852
LIAM: Stares at the tower for a moment.

03:32:21.379 --> 03:32:22.212
Okay.

03:32:23.309 --> 03:32:24.369
MARISHA: Yeah?

03:32:24.369 --> 03:32:25.202
LIAM: Yeah.

03:32:26.862 --> 03:32:28.272
TRAVIS: Where's that fucking owl?

03:32:28.272 --> 03:32:30.049
MARISHA: I know, fuck that.
LAURA: I keep my eyes out for any owls--

03:32:30.049 --> 03:32:31.751
MARISHA: You still have that pistol, yeah?

03:32:31.751 --> 03:32:32.584
SAM: Yeah.

03:32:32.584 --> 03:32:35.320
MARISHA: It's fucking owl season.
SAM: Want me to just start shooting?

03:32:35.320 --> 03:32:38.079
(laughter)

03:32:38.079 --> 03:32:40.181
TRAVIS: All the wizards come out and kill us.

03:32:40.181 --> 03:32:41.959
MATT: Nothing really draws attention

03:32:41.959 --> 03:32:45.134
in the middle of you know, the most wealthy,
magical district, in the greatest--

03:32:45.134 --> 03:32:46.039
TRAVIS: (screaming)

03:32:46.039 --> 03:32:48.759
MATT: -- the capital city than just a bunch of rapid gunfire

03:32:48.759 --> 03:32:51.014
in the middle of a courtyard.

03:32:51.014 --> 03:32:54.202
TALIESIN: Seven people running from a swarm of owls.

03:32:54.202 --> 03:32:56.378
(laughter)

03:32:59.829 --> 03:33:01.129
SAM: Well, we didn't die.

03:33:01.129 --> 03:33:02.449
We didn't fight.

03:33:02.449 --> 03:33:04.132
LIAM: No.
SAM: Just had dinner.

03:33:04.132 --> 03:33:06.199
That's good. Right?

03:33:06.199 --> 03:33:09.439
LIAM: It was good, the steak was outstanding.

03:33:09.439 --> 03:33:11.680
MARISHA: Oh my god, it was so good.
It was the best, I mean--

03:33:11.680 --> 03:33:13.571
ASHLEY: I didn't eat.
TRAVIS: I didn't either.

03:33:13.571 --> 03:33:15.271
ASHLEY: I'm starving.

03:33:15.271 --> 03:33:17.439
MARISHA: Let's go-- let's find a dive bar.

03:33:17.439 --> 03:33:20.306
ASHLEY: I'm mad I didn't try it,
but just out of principle

03:33:20.306 --> 03:33:22.339
I didn't want to touch anything.

03:33:22.339 --> 03:33:24.359
LAURA: I get that, I totally get that.

03:33:24.359 --> 03:33:28.236
I feel like out of principle, I wanted to touch it all.

03:33:28.236 --> 03:33:30.004
ASHLEY: Yeah, I get it, I get it.

03:33:30.004 --> 03:33:31.996
TRAVIS: He looked sickly, right?

03:33:31.996 --> 03:33:34.009
Has he always looked like that?

03:33:34.009 --> 03:33:36.119
MARISHA: I feel like he's always looked like shit,

03:33:36.119 --> 03:33:39.449
but he did look particularly sickly, right?

03:33:39.449 --> 03:33:44.389
LIAM: He had a little more vigor in my youth, but not much.

03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:45.222
TALIESIN: Gaunt.

03:33:45.222 --> 03:33:48.709
MATT: Yeah, nothing different than
last time you encountered him.

03:33:48.709 --> 03:33:53.505
He just in generally has that
sort of Mr. Burns complexion about him.

03:33:53.505 --> 03:33:54.338
(laughs)

03:33:54.338 --> 03:33:56.955
TRAVIS: All right, fair.
LAURA: Okay.

03:33:58.404 --> 03:34:00.737
ASHLEY: Do you know how old he is?

03:34:02.249 --> 03:34:05.399
LIAM: Well, unless he has pulled the wool over my eyes

03:34:05.399 --> 03:34:08.082
in another way, he's in his late seventies.

03:34:08.082 --> 03:34:09.740
MATT: Late seventies, yeah.

03:34:12.006 --> 03:34:13.520
MARISHA: He needs to take a hint from the ladies

03:34:13.520 --> 03:34:15.420
and use some of those glamours.

03:34:18.489 --> 03:34:19.790
Let's get out of the Shimmer Ward.

03:34:19.790 --> 03:34:21.512
I don't want to have a drink in the Shimmer Ward.

03:34:23.259 --> 03:34:24.899
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:34:24.899 --> 03:34:28.289
LAURA: Caleb, I'm really sorry that I made a comment

03:34:28.289 --> 03:34:30.040
about Astrid's haircut.

03:34:31.640 --> 03:34:32.473
LIAM: Oh.

03:34:33.759 --> 03:34:35.339
LAURA: I was trying to be shitty.
LIAM: I--

03:34:35.339 --> 03:34:38.547
LAURA: And that's-- that was a horrible thing to do.

03:34:38.547 --> 03:34:40.264
SAM: I thought you complimented her.

03:34:40.264 --> 03:34:44.064
LAURA: Yeah, but I did it in that girl way
where I was being a shithead about it.

03:34:44.064 --> 03:34:46.830
SAM: You were being a mean girl?
LAURA: I was being a mean girl.

03:34:46.830 --> 03:34:49.469
SAM: Yeah, that's not cool. That's never cool.

03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:51.219
TRAVIS: It sounded like you were complimenting her.

03:34:51.219 --> 03:34:53.059
MARISHA: Oh, that was totally code for mean girl.

03:34:53.059 --> 03:34:55.689
Like, "Your hair is really cute."

03:34:55.689 --> 03:34:57.064
LAURA: It was so mean.

03:34:57.064 --> 03:34:59.299
MARISHA: That's code for like,
"What the fuck are you doing?"

03:34:59.299 --> 03:35:00.889
LAURA: That's how the girls used to talk to <i>me</i>

03:35:00.889 --> 03:35:02.431
when I was outside.

03:35:02.431 --> 03:35:03.942
I don't know why I did it.

03:35:03.942 --> 03:35:05.789
TALIESIN: Well, we all learn it somewhere, I guess.

03:35:05.789 --> 03:35:08.302
Was that really mean, "Your hair is cute"?

03:35:08.302 --> 03:35:10.237
MARISHA: Depends on how you say it.

03:35:10.237 --> 03:35:12.574
ASHLEY: We also didn't know if she was going to be...

03:35:12.574 --> 03:35:14.926
LAURA: I thought she was a bad person.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, I know exactly--

03:35:14.926 --> 03:35:17.178
LIAM: I think you were just trying
to stick up for a friend.

03:35:17.178 --> 03:35:18.619
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:35:18.619 --> 03:35:22.409
SAM: No, I think that the slightly mean hair comment

03:35:22.409 --> 03:35:24.829
was the worst thing that happened tonight

03:35:24.829 --> 03:35:26.969
and the worst thing that was talked about.

03:35:26.969 --> 03:35:30.482
LIAM: Yeah, if I'm going to take anything away tonight.

03:35:31.599 --> 03:35:33.474
MARISHA: I...

03:35:33.474 --> 03:35:37.307
am so fucking tired of manipulative assholes.

03:35:37.307 --> 03:35:38.889
LAURA: He's so manipulative.

03:35:38.889 --> 03:35:40.722
MARISHA: Like what's the deal-- what's the--

03:35:40.722 --> 03:35:43.738
why is that a theme with all of us?

03:35:43.738 --> 03:35:46.519
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.
LIAM: Well, we spend a lot time around government.

03:35:46.519 --> 03:35:48.502
(laughter)

03:35:55.001 --> 03:35:57.449
TALIESIN: That's the best thing you've ever said.

03:35:58.300 --> 03:36:00.619
LIAM: I missed it, what did she say?

03:36:00.619 --> 03:36:02.669
MARISHA: "I don't know what you're talking about."

03:36:04.239 --> 03:36:06.129
ASHLEY: It is a bit of a theme.

03:36:06.129 --> 03:36:08.617
MARISHA: I don't know why so many people have gone

03:36:08.617 --> 03:36:11.709
through such great lengths to try

03:36:11.709 --> 03:36:14.339
and convince us all that <i>they're</i> responsible

03:36:14.339 --> 03:36:15.702
for our success.

03:36:17.949 --> 03:36:18.782
TALIESIN: It's weird.

03:36:21.319 --> 03:36:22.402
MARISHA: The manipulation.

03:36:22.402 --> 03:36:26.143
If I hear one more person try and claim

03:36:26.143 --> 03:36:28.859
that pain is the only way...

03:36:30.142 --> 03:36:32.042
to make a resilient person.

03:36:34.079 --> 03:36:35.682
What a shitty excuse.

03:36:37.369 --> 03:36:38.872
LAURA: He's such a bad man.

03:36:40.119 --> 03:36:44.099
SAM: But you didn't want to just,
you know, quick draw on him,

03:36:44.099 --> 03:36:46.349
take him down right there in his dining room?

03:36:47.189 --> 03:36:51.429
LIAM: I give myself a 30% chance of success.

03:36:51.429 --> 03:36:54.395
SAM: You got us with you.
Element of surprise.

03:36:54.395 --> 03:36:58.159
LIAM: I give us 40% chance of success.

03:36:58.159 --> 03:37:01.589
TALIESIN: Really, I would've thought
that would've dropped it to like 28.

03:37:01.589 --> 03:37:03.481
LIAM: In there?
MARISHA: We could have done it.

03:37:03.481 --> 03:37:05.207
LIAM: In there, dicey.

03:37:06.272 --> 03:37:07.699
MARISHA: It's not killing him.

03:37:07.699 --> 03:37:08.657
TRAVIS: As soon as we walked in,

03:37:08.657 --> 03:37:13.559
I was not able to see anything with my vision anymore.

03:37:13.559 --> 03:37:15.309
It was immediately dispelled.

03:37:15.309 --> 03:37:17.747
LAURA: He can probably block some of our magic.

03:37:17.747 --> 03:37:19.380
TRAVIS: Fair bet.

03:37:19.380 --> 03:37:21.369
MARISHA: There's no way we would have gotten out.

03:37:21.369 --> 03:37:24.509
LAURA: Plus, he had Astrid and Eadwulf on his side.

03:37:24.509 --> 03:37:27.129
They're both probably pretty powerful.

03:37:27.129 --> 03:37:29.769
Not as powerful as you Caleb, let's be honest,

03:37:29.769 --> 03:37:31.209
but pretty powerful.

03:37:31.209 --> 03:37:33.489
I don't care that they had more years.

03:37:33.489 --> 03:37:35.331
It doesn't matter. You're very powerful.

03:37:35.331 --> 03:37:36.719
MARISHA: Did we find a tavern?

03:37:36.719 --> 03:37:37.552
TALIESIN: He said it himself.

03:37:37.552 --> 03:37:41.127
He's surrounded by people who despise him and lie to him.

03:37:41.127 --> 03:37:42.779
He's-- the minute that he slips up,

03:37:42.779 --> 03:37:44.388
someone's going to take him out, anyway.

03:37:44.388 --> 03:37:46.889
We don't have to do anything.

03:37:46.889 --> 03:37:48.714
He's set up his own destruction.

03:37:50.019 --> 03:37:51.239
The minute he'd stop losing,

03:37:51.239 --> 03:37:55.849
I'm sure both of them would turn
on him in a heartbeat, and he knows it.

03:37:55.849 --> 03:37:57.659
It's just so dumb.

03:37:57.659 --> 03:38:00.349
MARISHA: But, but he's not dumb.

03:38:00.349 --> 03:38:03.539
TALIESIN: Eh? I think he's pretty dumb.
MARISHA: So why?

03:38:03.539 --> 03:38:07.469
MARISHA: Emotionally, maybe, narrow-minded, yes,

03:38:07.469 --> 03:38:10.739
but he's calculated.

03:38:10.739 --> 03:38:12.849
LAURA: He knows exactly what he's saying.

03:38:12.849 --> 03:38:15.749
LIAM: Yeah, he's always been one to control narrative.

03:38:16.969 --> 03:38:19.609
And that is a big part of holding onto power,

03:38:19.609 --> 03:38:21.599
controlling narrative.

03:38:21.599 --> 03:38:23.409
LAURA: I believed him.

03:38:23.409 --> 03:38:27.639
I believe him, that your parents said do whatever it takes.

03:38:27.639 --> 03:38:29.999
I didn't feel like he was lying there, but--

03:38:29.999 --> 03:38:30.832
MARISHA: Of course.

03:38:30.832 --> 03:38:33.309
LAURA: There's no way they knew what that meant.

03:38:33.309 --> 03:38:37.019
TALIESIN: I have a funny feeling that if we
brought them back for a five minute chat,

03:38:37.019 --> 03:38:41.119
their first response would be, "I didn't agree to <i>this</i>."

03:38:41.119 --> 03:38:43.535
LAURA: Caleb, on that note,

03:38:44.502 --> 03:38:46.227
I was thinking about it at dinner.

03:38:46.227 --> 03:38:49.569
I mean, between Caduceus and I...

03:38:50.577 --> 03:38:52.309
we could bring them back.

03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:54.459
SAM: Don't you need a body?
TALIESIN: Body.

03:38:56.969 --> 03:38:57.802
LAURA: Oh.

03:39:02.369 --> 03:39:03.202
Yeah.

03:39:04.199 --> 03:39:07.679
SAM: Was there a grave for them?
LAURA: I think you just need bones?

03:39:07.679 --> 03:39:09.887
SAM: Yeah. Is there-- is there a marking?

03:39:09.887 --> 03:39:10.874
Do you know?

03:39:13.182 --> 03:39:15.144
LIAM: I have not looked into it.

03:39:16.656 --> 03:39:19.156
LAURA: I mean, if it's something you want to look into.

03:39:21.879 --> 03:39:23.509
LIAM: Let me think about that.

03:39:23.509 --> 03:39:25.562
There is a very good chance that the...

03:39:28.252 --> 03:39:30.510
Scourgers collected their remains, but maybe.

03:39:30.510 --> 03:39:33.993
Scourgers collected their remains, but maybe.

03:39:36.019 --> 03:39:38.033
LAURA: I'm sorry to bring it up.

03:39:38.033 --> 03:39:40.116
LIAM: No, it-- no, you--

03:39:40.116 --> 03:39:43.619
no, you are all trying to help me.

03:39:43.619 --> 03:39:48.459
No. Let's find that dive bar

03:39:48.459 --> 03:39:51.079
and then there's an inn,

03:39:51.079 --> 03:39:53.432
a place I know where we can stay tonight.

03:39:53.432 --> 03:39:54.548
MARISHA: Okay.

03:39:55.869 --> 03:39:57.239
MATT: Easy enough to find a dive bar.

03:39:57.239 --> 03:39:58.599
There are plenty of places in Rexxentrum

03:39:58.599 --> 03:40:00.515
especially up in the...

03:40:01.957 --> 03:40:05.569
northern more mud-laden region.

03:40:05.569 --> 03:40:08.169
You stumble into one of the nearby dive bars,

03:40:08.169 --> 03:40:10.289
not making too much of a fuss

03:40:10.289 --> 03:40:13.395
and find a place to comfortably feel like you can talk.

03:40:19.049 --> 03:40:21.489
SAM: Did that go well for you?

03:40:21.489 --> 03:40:22.905
LIAM: (laughs ruefully)

03:40:22.905 --> 03:40:23.752
No.

03:40:24.702 --> 03:40:26.862
No, it gave me 50 more questions.

03:40:29.099 --> 03:40:34.099
SAM: It seems like Astrid was,
you know, not a total...

03:40:34.240 --> 03:40:35.506
sociopath.

03:40:38.109 --> 03:40:39.079
Maybe?

03:40:39.079 --> 03:40:41.740
TALIESIN: I quite liked both of them, actually.

03:40:41.740 --> 03:40:42.929
LIAM: Yeah?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:40:42.929 --> 03:40:44.289
LIAM: They're very likable.

03:40:44.289 --> 03:40:45.762
TALIESIN: Well.
LIAM: They always were.

03:40:47.822 --> 03:40:49.679
TALIESIN: I've got a pretty good read on people.

03:40:49.679 --> 03:40:50.979
I think they're all right.

03:40:52.669 --> 03:40:55.002
And you did a good thing for them today.

03:40:56.099 --> 03:40:58.194
Showed them what life could be like,

03:40:58.194 --> 03:41:00.329
even just for a second.

03:41:00.329 --> 03:41:02.029
Maybe it'll stick in them.

03:41:02.979 --> 03:41:05.079
LIAM: I find myself wondering

03:41:06.062 --> 03:41:08.378
his "plan" for me to...

03:41:10.312 --> 03:41:13.295
take wing and achieve the things he wanted

03:41:13.295 --> 03:41:15.570
without being right under his thumb.

03:41:22.369 --> 03:41:25.272
If I go off and do anything with you all,

03:41:26.379 --> 03:41:27.929
is it part of his plan?

03:41:32.289 --> 03:41:35.259
TALIESIN: I got the sense he's kind of winging it.

03:41:35.259 --> 03:41:36.879
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know.

03:41:36.879 --> 03:41:40.288
They hand delivered a letter to you
when you were in Rexxentrum.

03:41:40.288 --> 03:41:42.241
I think he was--
MARISHA: He knew we were meeting with Vess.

03:41:42.241 --> 03:41:44.319
TRAVIS: -- pretty much on top of it.

03:41:44.319 --> 03:41:46.479
TALIESIN: He's not-- he's not directing us, though.

03:41:46.479 --> 03:41:48.659
This is just him taking credit for what you're doing

03:41:48.659 --> 03:41:51.209
so that you can feel like you're being manipulated.

03:41:53.079 --> 03:41:55.689
This is--
MARISHA: It's an interesting--

03:41:55.689 --> 03:41:57.259
TALIESIN: This is just a person who can't admit

03:41:57.259 --> 03:41:58.736
that they're not in control.

03:41:58.736 --> 03:42:00.969
MARISHA: It's like a tarot card reader.

03:42:00.969 --> 03:42:05.677
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's actually a very fair estimation.
LAURA: Hey!

03:42:05.677 --> 03:42:07.789
That's not a good comparison at all.

03:42:07.789 --> 03:42:10.559
MARISHA: It's a great comparison, I'm brilliant.

03:42:10.559 --> 03:42:14.099
(laughter)

03:42:14.099 --> 03:42:15.599
SAM: Hey, speaking of tarot cards

03:42:15.599 --> 03:42:18.049
and stuff and controlling the narrative--

03:42:18.049 --> 03:42:19.469
LAURA: Do you want me to read your fortune?

03:42:19.469 --> 03:42:20.302
SAM: I do.

03:42:21.389 --> 03:42:23.529
While you're doing that,

03:42:23.529 --> 03:42:27.109
something that I assume you told me earlier about,

03:42:27.109 --> 03:42:31.219
about the research that you did today, or rather didn't do.

03:42:31.219 --> 03:42:32.369
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:42:32.369 --> 03:42:34.729
SAM: What if-- crazy theory--

03:42:34.729 --> 03:42:35.609
MARISHA: I'm here for it.

03:42:35.609 --> 03:42:39.939
SAM: What if there's no record of the Eyes of Nine

03:42:39.939 --> 03:42:43.049
in the Cobalt library

03:42:43.049 --> 03:42:45.399
not because they're hiding it from you,

03:42:45.399 --> 03:42:49.547
but because it was scrubbed because

03:42:49.547 --> 03:42:54.547
this Trent man or his ilk are somehow...

03:42:55.119 --> 03:42:56.689
you know, controlling the narrative,

03:42:56.689 --> 03:42:58.219
they don't want anyone to know about it.

03:42:58.219 --> 03:43:00.769
Or maybe even the Cobalt Soul itself.

03:43:00.769 --> 03:43:02.559
MARISHA: But Trent didn't seem to know what it was.

03:43:02.559 --> 03:43:04.534
I deliberately wanted to see in--

03:43:04.534 --> 03:43:07.279
SAM: He didn't <i>seem</i> to know, but he's a crafty fucker.

03:43:07.279 --> 03:43:09.987
MARISHA: He is, but not--
TALIESIN: I didn't get that vibe.

03:43:09.987 --> 03:43:11.899
MARISHA: He immediately asked if it was something

03:43:11.899 --> 03:43:13.609
that Vess put us up to.

03:43:13.609 --> 03:43:18.259
So, that to me clued me in on how laser focused he is

03:43:18.259 --> 03:43:20.342
on that aspect.

03:43:22.029 --> 03:43:24.862
Scrubbed, absolutely. From Trent?

03:43:26.595 --> 03:43:28.429
I don't know. The Cobalt Soul,

03:43:28.429 --> 03:43:30.309
they did also ask me if they've--

03:43:30.309 --> 03:43:32.889
if they went under any other names,

03:43:32.889 --> 03:43:36.969
if I know of any other associative language attached

03:43:36.969 --> 03:43:38.229
to the Eyes of Nine.

03:43:38.229 --> 03:43:40.689
SAM: Well, we know Nonagon, right?

03:43:40.689 --> 03:43:43.116
MARISHA: So I was-- I was thinking about that.

03:43:43.116 --> 03:43:44.989
And then here's the other crazy thing,

03:43:44.989 --> 03:43:47.269
nothing to do with your shit, really sorry,

03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:48.329
kind of going on a tangent.

03:43:48.329 --> 03:43:50.419
SAM: I don't know, maybe it's all connected.

03:43:50.419 --> 03:43:54.577
MARISHA: So, Trent asked us about

03:43:54.577 --> 03:43:57.433
Shattengrod and tomb raiding.

03:43:57.433 --> 03:43:59.519
Nonagon-- where is it?

03:43:59.519 --> 03:44:00.352
Hang on--

03:44:00.352 --> 03:44:01.812
TALIESIN: Rhymes with?
MARISHA: Cree--

03:44:01.812 --> 03:44:03.387
(laughter)

03:44:03.387 --> 03:44:06.312
SAM: Has 14 letters in it, which is--

03:44:06.312 --> 03:44:07.509
MARISHA: When you rearrange them

03:44:07.509 --> 03:44:10.143
and add their numeral position together--!

03:44:10.143 --> 03:44:12.422
LIAM: Remember to drink your Ovaltine.

03:44:12.422 --> 03:44:14.355
(laughter)

03:44:15.239 --> 03:44:16.072
MARISHA: But no.

03:44:17.669 --> 03:44:20.749
That Cree that we talked to at The Gentleman's lair--

03:44:20.749 --> 03:44:23.473
ASHLEY: Yes!
MARISHA: -- asked about Nonagon

03:44:23.473 --> 03:44:27.399
and said that she was a part of his team called

03:44:27.399 --> 03:44:31.209
the Tomb Takers and that they were running

03:44:31.209 --> 03:44:35.479
from a spell caster two years ago.

03:44:35.479 --> 03:44:38.829
MARISHA: Running from a spell caster named <i>Trent Ikithon</i>!

03:44:38.829 --> 03:44:41.053
MARISHA: Or Vess DeRogna,

03:44:41.053 --> 03:44:45.638
the lady of antiquities who sends people off to rob tombs.

03:44:45.638 --> 03:44:47.751
LAURA: (gasps)

03:44:47.751 --> 03:44:50.759
And I was already planning on going to see my dad.

03:44:50.759 --> 03:44:52.879
This is perfect.
ASHLEY: Cree was that person's name?

03:44:52.879 --> 03:44:54.699
MARISHA: Cree the tabaxi.

03:44:54.699 --> 03:44:57.496
ASHLEY: And Cree recognized--

03:44:57.496 --> 03:44:58.746
MARISHA: Nonagon.

03:44:58.746 --> 03:45:00.554
ASHLEY: Nonagon, which was...

03:45:01.620 --> 03:45:03.509
MARISHA: Molly.
ASHLEY: Molly.

03:45:03.509 --> 03:45:04.569
MARISHA: And...

03:45:07.676 --> 03:45:08.816
ASHLEY: I mean, they would probably know--

03:45:08.816 --> 03:45:11.959
MARISHA: Their group-- stole a book and trouble

03:45:11.959 --> 03:45:16.259
with the law. Ritual resistant teleport spell. Stole a book.

03:45:16.259 --> 03:45:17.499
Did they steal a book or something?

03:45:17.499 --> 03:45:20.467
I'm trying to decipher my notes, like, a year later.

03:45:21.629 --> 03:45:23.099
MATT: More or less, best that you can recall.

03:45:23.099 --> 03:45:25.469
MARISHA: They maybe stole a book, I don't know,

03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:29.359
but they were running from someone
and they were called the Tomb Takers.

03:45:29.359 --> 03:45:31.139
LAURA: Whoa.
ASHLEY: I remember that.

03:45:31.139 --> 03:45:32.239
LAURA: Maybe we should just--

03:45:32.239 --> 03:45:35.044
SAM: Oh, the "Tomb Takers" or
the "Task Takers," I wrote down.

03:45:35.949 --> 03:45:38.222
But no, I also wrote down Tomb Taker.
MARISHA: The task--

03:45:38.222 --> 03:45:41.699
LAURA: What-- what if I--
MARISHA: Oh now, are they the Tomb Taskers?

03:45:41.699 --> 03:45:44.259
SAM: I wrote down "Tomb Takers or Task Takers."

03:45:44.259 --> 03:45:46.219
LAURA: What if we just like--

03:45:46.219 --> 03:45:48.127
while we're hanging out with Vess and we're like,

03:45:48.127 --> 03:45:50.902
"Oh my god, we should come up
with a group name or something."

03:45:50.902 --> 03:45:53.229
MARISHA: "I got an idea, the Tomb Takers!"

03:45:53.229 --> 03:45:54.629
LAURA: And see what says.
MARISHA: And see if she's like--

03:45:54.629 --> 03:45:56.412
(gasp) Dun dun dun!

03:45:56.412 --> 03:45:57.437
It's a pretty good idea.

03:45:57.437 --> 03:45:59.779
TALIESIN: We could just talk to them.

03:45:59.779 --> 03:46:01.862
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Or that.

03:46:01.862 --> 03:46:04.211
SAM: Your plans are always so boring.

03:46:04.211 --> 03:46:06.539
(laughter)

03:46:06.539 --> 03:46:07.902
TALIESIN: I'll let you go first.

03:46:08.812 --> 03:46:10.029
I'd like to have a backup.

03:46:10.029 --> 03:46:12.271
I like to have a plan G.
SAM: Sure.

03:46:12.271 --> 03:46:14.089
(laughter)

03:46:14.089 --> 03:46:16.363
MARISHA: Then I feel like there was another thing...

03:46:16.363 --> 03:46:17.679
Oh! Oh!

03:46:19.719 --> 03:46:20.552
Okay, hang on.

03:46:20.552 --> 03:46:22.369
TALIESIN: You've mentioned that tabaxi before.

03:46:22.369 --> 03:46:25.226
LIAM: We are in a bar while she does this.
It's so perfect.

03:46:25.226 --> 03:46:27.799
MARISHA: I'm just flinging notebooks around,

03:46:27.799 --> 03:46:29.549
as Beau goes through all of her notebooks.

03:46:30.993 --> 03:46:35.993
SAM: Can we get a round of drinks and
some yarn, and some thumbtacks, please?

03:46:36.132 --> 03:46:38.383
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, hold on, it's coming."

03:46:38.383 --> 03:46:42.019
MARISHA: This is super conspiracy theory-tastic, but okay.

03:46:42.019 --> 03:46:46.019
So we're going to excavate the city of Aeor.

03:46:46.019 --> 03:46:50.002
And it was this mage... ocrity.

03:46:50.002 --> 03:46:50.989
LIAM: A mageocracy.

03:46:50.989 --> 03:46:54.663
MARISHA: And they think that no survivors lived.

03:46:54.663 --> 03:46:56.163
Right?
LIAM: Right.

03:46:57.449 --> 03:47:01.569
MARISHA: But what if there was <i>one</i>?

03:47:01.569 --> 03:47:02.402
SAM: Who?

03:47:02.402 --> 03:47:03.759
MARISHA: Halas.

03:47:03.759 --> 03:47:06.869
SAM: Who's Halas? Oh! The Happy Fun Ball?

03:47:06.869 --> 03:47:11.159
MARISHA: Yes, because when we were in his little ball

03:47:11.159 --> 03:47:12.509
for the Astral Sea thing,

03:47:12.509 --> 03:47:14.925
we already mentioned this in the Happy Fun Ball.

03:47:14.925 --> 03:47:17.967
And then we saw the Astral Sea--
LIAM: I wanted to follow up at this,

03:47:17.967 --> 03:47:20.779
this coming week in the libraries and see if--

03:47:20.779 --> 03:47:21.884
MARISHA: Right.

03:47:21.884 --> 03:47:25.689
Because he had that map and it was the map from--

03:47:25.689 --> 03:47:28.788
that you touched the red gem of,

03:47:28.788 --> 03:47:31.609
and it was pre-Calamity.

03:47:31.609 --> 03:47:33.259
LAURA: Oh yeah, definitely.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:47:33.259 --> 03:47:36.084
MARISHA: The stained glass window was a pre-Calamity map.

03:47:37.349 --> 03:47:40.229
So maybe this guy was from pre-Calamity

03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:43.579
and he got super obsessed with, like, living for forever.

03:47:43.579 --> 03:47:44.609
But maybe what if he's--

03:47:44.609 --> 03:47:49.609
what if he's a survivor from Aeora-- Aeor? Aorta?

03:47:49.609 --> 03:47:52.105
LIAM: No, that is plausible.

03:47:52.105 --> 03:47:54.289
MARISHA: But I don't even know how any of this connects!

03:47:54.289 --> 03:47:59.274
SAM: Well, the Astral Sea also
connects Vokodo somehow, right?

03:47:59.274 --> 03:48:01.275
ASHLEY: And that weird floating city?
TRAVIS: That's where he came from.

03:48:01.275 --> 03:48:04.569
MARISHA: What if Aeor is part of that weird floating city

03:48:04.569 --> 03:48:06.711
that we saw? What if it just like-- (whooshes)

03:48:06.711 --> 03:48:11.192
MARISHA: Oh, like that's Aeor and it just bamfed into--?!

03:48:11.192 --> 03:48:14.207
ASHLEY: Like it was so magical it just--

03:48:14.207 --> 03:48:16.507
MARISHA: It just like-- it didn't
actually crash? It's there?

03:48:16.507 --> 03:48:18.107
LAURA: We figured out the whole world!

03:48:18.107 --> 03:48:22.269
LIAM: Or a contemporary-- another city of the time.

03:48:23.179 --> 03:48:26.087
LAURA: While all this is happening, I'm going to be

03:48:26.087 --> 03:48:28.412
telling Fjord's fortune with tarot cards.

03:48:28.412 --> 03:48:30.426
TRAVIS: I didn't ask you-- why
do you keep putting them there?

03:48:30.426 --> 03:48:32.269
LAURA: I'm going to pull out the cards.

03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:34.019
Just choose a number between one

03:48:34.019 --> 03:48:36.007
and 20. Roll your dice.

03:48:38.234 --> 03:48:39.292
TRAVIS: Eight.

03:48:39.292 --> 03:48:42.926
LAURA: Okay, that's going to be the card you pulled out.

03:48:42.926 --> 03:48:44.892
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

03:48:44.892 --> 03:48:46.942
LAURA: Okay. Going to see what that is.

03:48:46.942 --> 03:48:49.339
TALIESIN: I was going to say, I don't remember the
last time I sent you that document.

03:48:49.339 --> 03:48:50.334
LAURA: Okay.

03:48:50.334 --> 03:48:53.741
I don't know-- I'm just going to read this card for you.

03:48:53.741 --> 03:48:55.239
TRAVIS: And this tells me my future?

03:48:55.239 --> 03:48:58.223
LAURA: Obviously I'm going to interpret it.
TRAVIS: It's my future, or what?

03:48:58.223 --> 03:49:01.531
LAURA: This is going
to be where you are right now,

03:49:01.531 --> 03:49:03.197
in your present.

03:49:03.197 --> 03:49:04.569
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:49:04.569 --> 03:49:08.672
LAURA: The eye and the hand is the card.

03:49:09.939 --> 03:49:11.513
So...
SAM: You have both of those things.

03:49:11.513 --> 03:49:12.346
It's amazing.

03:49:12.346 --> 03:49:16.902
LAURA: Yeah, one way, which-- pick--

03:49:17.884 --> 03:49:19.742
roll a d6.

03:49:19.742 --> 03:49:21.229
TALIESIN: (laughs)

03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:23.384
TRAVIS: I feel like you're making this up.

03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:25.062
Two.

03:49:25.062 --> 03:49:28.949
LAURA: Okay, so the eye is facing towards you.

03:49:28.949 --> 03:49:33.162
An eye is held by two hands forming a triangle.

03:49:34.059 --> 03:49:38.362
The hands are holding the eye above a restless sea.

03:49:39.827 --> 03:49:43.202
(laughter)

03:49:49.679 --> 03:49:51.217
SAM: An eye.

03:49:51.217 --> 03:49:52.658
LAURA: Yeah!

03:49:52.658 --> 03:49:53.851
I know!

03:49:53.851 --> 03:49:55.176
Above a restless sea!

03:49:55.176 --> 03:49:57.976
SAM: Amazing!
LAURA: Oh my god, Fjord!

03:49:57.976 --> 03:50:00.101
The triangle's like Rumblecusp.

03:50:00.101 --> 03:50:02.171
Oh my gosh, this-- okay.

03:50:02.171 --> 03:50:03.929
Now roll another d20.

03:50:03.929 --> 03:50:06.912
TRAVIS: There's more?
LAURA: Yeah, then this is going to be your future.

03:50:06.912 --> 03:50:08.839
SAM: Wait, wait, what was the interpretation of that?

03:50:08.839 --> 03:50:11.889
LAURA: Oh, that's-- you know, obviously you are--

03:50:11.889 --> 03:50:16.089
you are torn between where you came from,

03:50:16.089 --> 03:50:19.389
which is the eye and the sea, the turmoil

03:50:19.389 --> 03:50:21.829
of the Wild Mother right now.

03:50:21.829 --> 03:50:24.659
You're figuring out who you are in this very moment.

03:50:24.659 --> 03:50:28.059
Do you go and take care of Uk'otoa--

03:50:28.059 --> 03:50:30.689
ALL: (whispered) Uk'otoa.

03:50:30.689 --> 03:50:33.843
LAURA: -- or do you follow the path
that's being laid in front of you by her?

03:50:33.843 --> 03:50:35.101
TRAVIS: 11.

03:50:36.815 --> 03:50:40.169
Oh my god, this is such a good card.

03:50:41.199 --> 03:50:42.209
TALIESIN: I love this so much.

03:50:42.209 --> 03:50:46.879
LAURA: This card is called Home or Traveler.

03:50:46.879 --> 03:50:49.346
SAM: Traveler?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:50:49.346 --> 03:50:51.049
MARISHA: Oh, wait, is this a secondary card?

03:50:51.049 --> 03:50:52.970
LAURA: Yeah, this is the future card.

03:50:52.970 --> 03:50:55.159
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

03:50:55.159 --> 03:50:57.829
LAURA: A covered carnival wagon on a road

03:50:57.829 --> 03:51:01.032
with a cottage cozy in the distance.

03:51:02.182 --> 03:51:03.515
You are--
SAM: That's us!

03:51:03.515 --> 03:51:05.836
LAURA: Yeah! You're a--
TRAVIS: How is that you?!

03:51:05.836 --> 03:51:09.729
SAM: When we met you, we were at a carnival!

03:51:09.729 --> 03:51:11.693
LAURA: So it's a carnival card,

03:51:11.693 --> 03:51:14.466
but it's a cozy cottage in the distance, Fjord.

03:51:14.466 --> 03:51:16.099
Don't you see?
SAM: We are your home.

03:51:16.989 --> 03:51:18.697
LAURA: Don't you see?
TRAVIS: I don't--

03:51:18.697 --> 03:51:20.269
LAURA: You're you're on the road right now.

03:51:20.269 --> 03:51:22.599
You feel like everything is a circus.

03:51:22.599 --> 03:51:27.299
You don't know what's going on, but in the distance, Fjord,

03:51:27.299 --> 03:51:29.982
there is a cozy home waiting for you.

03:51:31.939 --> 03:51:34.029
That's your future.

03:51:34.029 --> 03:51:35.571
TRAVIS: A cozy home?

03:51:35.571 --> 03:51:39.794
LAURA: Yeah! Your home, your place, you will find it.

03:51:42.539 --> 03:51:44.369
TRAVIS: That's wonderful, Jester.

03:51:44.369 --> 03:51:46.317
LAURA: I know, isn't it?

03:51:49.369 --> 03:51:50.577
Anybody else?

03:51:51.999 --> 03:51:55.379
MATT: Caleb, as a note, too, going off the conversation

03:51:55.379 --> 03:51:56.689
with Beauregard--

03:51:56.689 --> 03:51:58.322
That was amazing.

03:51:59.429 --> 03:52:02.069
You did know, cause you recalled this as you were recalling

03:52:02.069 --> 03:52:05.182
information about Halas in the Folding Halls.

03:52:06.369 --> 03:52:08.849
He is historically known to have hailed from

03:52:10.181 --> 03:52:12.276
LIAM: Zeidel?
MATT: From, well--

03:52:12.276 --> 03:52:14.446
LIAM: He had books about Zeidel.

03:52:14.446 --> 03:52:17.229
MATT: Right, well Zeidel was the society,
the actual...

03:52:19.855 --> 03:52:21.171
council of Zeidel,

03:52:21.171 --> 03:52:22.289
which he was part of.

03:52:22.289 --> 03:52:25.999
But the actual city that he was from was Zemniaz,

03:52:25.999 --> 03:52:27.599
which was another one of the floating cities,

03:52:27.599 --> 03:52:29.679
a competitive nation to

03:52:29.679 --> 03:52:32.279
where Aeor would have come from that when it fell

03:52:32.279 --> 03:52:33.299
in the Calamity,

03:52:33.299 --> 03:52:35.129
the survivors of that are

03:52:35.129 --> 03:52:38.369
who began the early Dwendalian Empire.

03:52:38.369 --> 03:52:40.752
LIAM: When Zemniaz fell?
MATT: Yeah, Zemniaz fell,

03:52:40.752 --> 03:52:42.894
which is why it's called the Zemni
Fields and Zemnian language.

03:52:42.894 --> 03:52:47.894
It's all based on the survivors and scroungers of--

03:52:48.429 --> 03:52:50.649
LIAM: Another separate floating city.

03:52:50.649 --> 03:52:51.486
MATT: Correct.

03:52:51.486 --> 03:52:54.069
MARISHA: Okay, so scratch the whole "he was from Aeor"--

03:52:54.069 --> 03:52:57.242
but same time in neighboring--
LIAM: Same time.

03:52:57.242 --> 03:53:00.239
MATT: Zemniaz was a much smaller and comparatively to Aeor,

03:53:00.239 --> 03:53:02.909
Aeor was the superpower.

03:53:02.909 --> 03:53:04.829
Zemniaz was still a powerful agent, you know,

03:53:04.829 --> 03:53:08.449
one of a handful of floating mage nations.

03:53:08.449 --> 03:53:09.282
LIAM: Yeah.

03:53:09.282 --> 03:53:11.159
And it would be very interesting

03:53:11.159 --> 03:53:15.469
to dive back into the halls of Halas

03:53:15.469 --> 03:53:16.999
and find him and ask him questions,

03:53:16.999 --> 03:53:20.449
but that is quite a-- that's a tall order.
MARISHA: That's a task.

03:53:20.449 --> 03:53:23.999
But there's also all those businesses with Tharizdun

03:53:23.999 --> 03:53:25.999
and the Abyssal invasion that he apparently threatened.

03:53:25.999 --> 03:53:30.879
and the Abyssal invasion that he apparently threatened.

03:53:30.879 --> 03:53:34.309
SAM: Yeah, it seems like there's all sorts of other realms

03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:39.309
and planes sort of converging here for some reason.

03:53:40.023 --> 03:53:42.657
ASHLEY: I had written down the same thing.

03:53:44.419 --> 03:53:48.689
I had "an order of Tomb Takers question mark?

03:53:48.689 --> 03:53:51.549
"Went north to Shattenguard?

03:53:51.549 --> 03:53:53.219
"Mollymauk's old order."

03:53:53.219 --> 03:53:55.495
MARISHA: To Shattengrod, really? Okay!

03:53:55.495 --> 03:53:56.959
ASHLEY: Mollymauk's old order.

03:53:56.959 --> 03:53:59.439
He pulled them off from the main order.

03:53:59.439 --> 03:54:01.531
No idea what that means.

03:54:01.531 --> 03:54:03.071
LIAM: He made a sect.

03:54:03.071 --> 03:54:05.747
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: So yeah.

03:54:05.747 --> 03:54:07.039
TALIESIN: It's a sect.
ASHLEY: I mean, this was--

03:54:07.039 --> 03:54:08.488
TALIESIN: I'm a sect. That's good.

03:54:08.488 --> 03:54:11.859
MARISHA: What if it was Vess DeRogna
was that was coming after him?

03:54:11.859 --> 03:54:14.222
TALIESIN: I'm lost.

03:54:14.222 --> 03:54:16.749
LIAM: I mean, right after what I wrote--
SAM: Well, a magical woman revived him.

03:54:16.749 --> 03:54:19.179
MARISHA: Huh?
SAM: A magical woman revived him.

03:54:19.179 --> 03:54:20.012
Right?

03:54:21.339 --> 03:54:23.069
MARISHA: He-- yeah,

03:54:23.069 --> 03:54:24.419
he just woke up.

03:54:24.419 --> 03:54:27.299
SAM: Well no, I wrote down "a magical woman revived him."

03:54:27.299 --> 03:54:29.881
MARISHA: It was a ritual spell.
He doesn't know, he doesn't remember.

03:54:29.881 --> 03:54:32.499
LIAM: I thought-- I remember that as well.

03:54:32.499 --> 03:54:34.589
A woman helped pull him out of it.

03:54:34.589 --> 03:54:35.422
SAM: Yeah.

03:54:35.422 --> 03:54:36.255
LIAM: To my recollection.

03:54:36.255 --> 03:54:37.996
TRAVIS: Chat is just screaming at us right now.

03:54:37.996 --> 03:54:40.271
LIAM: Oh, sure. They've got it all figured out.

03:54:40.271 --> 03:54:42.679
(laughter)

03:54:42.679 --> 03:54:45.849
LIAM: But guys, where I wrote "Tomb Takers" and "Nonagon",

03:54:45.849 --> 03:54:50.845
I've also written "mahogany desk"
and "young, bearded gnome".

03:54:50.845 --> 03:54:54.714
(laughter)

03:54:54.714 --> 03:54:56.446
TALIESIN: You've cracked it.

03:54:56.446 --> 03:54:58.321
LIAM: We've cracked the case!
MARISHA: What if...

03:54:59.221 --> 03:55:00.404
TALIESIN: Orange gummy bear gnome.

03:55:00.404 --> 03:55:03.249
MARISHA: What if Nonagon...

03:55:03.249 --> 03:55:06.165
was pillaged?

03:55:06.165 --> 03:55:10.549
What if he was, instead of the robber,

03:55:10.549 --> 03:55:13.722
what if he was the rob-ee?

03:55:15.072 --> 03:55:15.905
TRAVIS: Robbie!

03:55:15.905 --> 03:55:16.898
MARISHA: Robbie!

03:55:16.898 --> 03:55:19.917
(laughter)

03:55:19.917 --> 03:55:21.102
Love you, Robbie.

03:55:21.102 --> 03:55:23.893
TALIESIN: I am genuinely delighted by all this.
TRAVIS: He's not Molly, he's Robbie!

03:55:23.893 --> 03:55:28.785
(laughter)

03:55:28.785 --> 03:55:30.019
MARISHA: I don't know, man.

03:55:30.019 --> 03:55:32.094
I have so many notes and--

03:55:32.094 --> 03:55:33.035
TRAVIS: Beau, drink your beer.

03:55:33.035 --> 03:55:36.259
It's got to-- it's got to connect.

03:55:36.259 --> 03:55:37.989
TRAVIS: Who gave her a straw for a beer?

03:55:37.989 --> 03:55:39.649
MARISHA: It's all I got, man.

03:55:39.649 --> 03:55:42.469
It's this weird-ass mixology bar.

03:55:44.179 --> 03:55:46.822
TALIESIN: We, uh...
MATT: Not on this side of Rexxentrum.

03:55:46.822 --> 03:55:48.229
TALIESIN: We have someone we can talk to.

03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:49.245
SAM: Who?

03:55:50.829 --> 03:55:52.949
TALIESIN: The tabaxi, Cree..

03:55:52.949 --> 03:55:54.779
SAM: So we're going to go to Zadash next.

03:55:54.779 --> 03:55:59.545
TALIESIN: And then maybe your dad can set up an

03:55:59.545 --> 03:56:01.378
honest conversation?

03:56:01.378 --> 03:56:02.819
LAURA: With Cree?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:56:02.819 --> 03:56:04.289
No threats, no harm.

03:56:04.289 --> 03:56:05.669
TRAVIS: If Cree's there.

03:56:05.669 --> 03:56:07.699
LAURA: I can send my dad a message

03:56:07.699 --> 03:56:09.529
and ask if he can gather Cree there.

03:56:09.529 --> 03:56:11.512
I'm going to send my dad a message.

03:56:12.351 --> 03:56:14.199
Hey Dad, it's me.

03:56:14.199 --> 03:56:16.012
We have a favor to ask.

03:56:18.071 --> 03:56:20.720
Can you get Cree?

03:56:22.119 --> 03:56:26.318
We need to talk to him.

03:56:26.318 --> 03:56:27.259
SAM: Him?

03:56:27.259 --> 03:56:28.092
Her.
MATT: Her.

03:56:28.092 --> 03:56:29.876
LAURA: Her. Shit. Her.

03:56:29.876 --> 03:56:31.365
LIAM: Him, her.
TRAVIS: (siren noise)

03:56:34.039 --> 03:56:35.347
LAURA: Super important!

03:56:37.453 --> 03:56:38.559
I love you!

03:56:41.629 --> 03:56:43.829
MATT: "Jester, it's been a while.

03:56:44.939 --> 03:56:49.319
"I'd love to help, but Cree left months ago

03:56:49.319 --> 03:56:50.539
"and hasn't returned.

03:56:50.539 --> 03:56:52.249
"So I have no idea what she is."

03:56:52.249 --> 03:56:53.149
LIAM: Damn it.

03:56:53.149 --> 03:56:54.799
MATT: "Sorry."

03:56:56.299 --> 03:56:57.490
"Anyway, I--"

03:56:57.490 --> 03:57:00.315
(laughter)

03:57:00.315 --> 03:57:02.842
TALIESIN: Actually, might be able to find him.

03:57:02.842 --> 03:57:04.646
MARISHA: Yeah, can we, can we send Cree a message?

03:57:04.646 --> 03:57:06.579
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:57:06.579 --> 03:57:08.282
I mean, I met Cree, right?

03:57:08.282 --> 03:57:10.319
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:57:10.319 --> 03:57:12.379
I'm going to send Cree a message.

03:57:12.379 --> 03:57:14.039
MATT: Okay.

03:57:14.039 --> 03:57:15.509
LAURA: Hi, Cree!
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:57:15.509 --> 03:57:17.929
LAURA: It's Jester. Remember me?

03:57:19.439 --> 03:57:20.272
Where are you?

03:57:20.272 --> 03:57:22.409
I need to talk to you.

03:57:22.409 --> 03:57:23.499
It's about--

03:57:23.499 --> 03:57:24.855
MARISHA: (whispered) Molly.

03:57:24.855 --> 03:57:25.908
Nonagon! Say Nonagon.

03:57:25.908 --> 03:57:26.741
LAURA: Nonagon.

03:57:26.741 --> 03:57:28.119
SAM: Or Lucien.
LAURA: Or Lucien.

03:57:28.119 --> 03:57:29.117
You know.

03:57:29.117 --> 03:57:31.329
(laughter)

03:57:31.329 --> 03:57:33.152
Lemme know, okay?

03:57:34.369 --> 03:57:35.610
That was four.

03:57:35.610 --> 03:57:37.481
(laughter)

03:57:37.481 --> 03:57:39.666
TRAVIS: "Let me know, okay?"

03:57:40.924 --> 03:57:43.643
SAM: Lemme. We're treating--
LAURA: Oh, lemme.

03:57:43.643 --> 03:57:45.419
TRAVIS: L-E-M-M-E, right?

03:57:45.419 --> 03:57:48.735
MATT: A few moments pass before you get a response.

03:57:49.849 --> 03:57:52.464
(distrustful) "Who is this?"

03:57:55.259 --> 03:57:57.199
LAURA: She doesn't remember me.

03:57:57.199 --> 03:57:59.850
MATT: "I don't think I can help you."

03:58:00.699 --> 03:58:01.890
That's it.

03:58:03.541 --> 03:58:05.780
LAURA: I'm going to send a message back.

03:58:07.069 --> 03:58:12.069
The blue girl. Jester. We met a while ago.

03:58:12.389 --> 03:58:14.309
I had a group of friends.

03:58:14.309 --> 03:58:16.869
We knew Lucien-- Lucien.

03:58:16.869 --> 03:58:17.702
SAM: At the club.

03:58:17.702 --> 03:58:20.299
LAURA: At the--
SAM: Gentleman's club.

03:58:20.299 --> 03:58:22.963
MARISHA: Uh... (babbles) The Evening Nip!

03:58:22.963 --> 03:58:24.446
LAURA: At the Evening Nip.

03:58:24.446 --> 03:58:26.282
LIAM: Down to the-- to the-- to the floor?

03:58:26.282 --> 03:58:27.929
SAM: Ooh, money is involved!

03:58:27.929 --> 03:58:29.347
LAURA: Money's involved.

03:58:29.347 --> 03:58:30.724
ASHLEY: Good job, good job.

03:58:32.665 --> 03:58:34.248
MATT: Few more moments pass.

03:58:35.522 --> 03:58:37.855
And a few more moments pass.

03:58:39.161 --> 03:58:40.243
After a while you get the sense that

03:58:40.243 --> 03:58:41.308
there's going to be no response.

03:58:41.308 --> 03:58:43.103
LIAM: (groans)

03:58:43.103 --> 03:58:46.404
LAURA: Bitch. She made me waste a spell slot.

03:58:47.299 --> 03:58:50.649
MARISHA: Well, if she works for The Gentleman,

03:58:50.649 --> 03:58:52.849
then we know The Gentleman has her blood

03:58:52.849 --> 03:58:55.331
and The Gentleman should be able to trace her.

03:58:55.331 --> 03:58:56.839
TALIESIN: We'll go tomorrow.

03:58:56.839 --> 03:58:57.672
LAURA: That's a good point.

03:58:57.672 --> 03:58:59.619
MATT: Point of interesting order.

03:58:59.619 --> 03:59:02.299
<i>She</i> was the one who kept

03:59:02.299 --> 03:59:04.274
and extracted the blood for The Gentleman.

03:59:04.274 --> 03:59:05.107
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:59:05.979 --> 03:59:09.789
MATT: That was specifically her skillset.

03:59:09.789 --> 03:59:10.622
LAURA: So she would probably--

03:59:10.622 --> 03:59:11.692
MATT: She was a blood cleric.

03:59:12.814 --> 03:59:15.833
TRAVIS: (singsong) Very similar to Molly.

03:59:15.833 --> 03:59:19.505
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Hmm! Hmm!

03:59:20.719 --> 03:59:22.736
SAM: Well, that's a dead end.

03:59:22.736 --> 03:59:24.569
TALIESIN: Uh, well...

03:59:24.569 --> 03:59:26.443
MARISHA: What do we do? What do we do?

03:59:26.443 --> 03:59:28.249
TALIESIN: I got-- I got things.

03:59:28.249 --> 03:59:29.659
TRAVIS: We go to Antarctica

03:59:29.659 --> 03:59:31.779
and we fucking find an underground city

03:59:31.779 --> 03:59:33.527
and some other crazy magic shit.

03:59:33.527 --> 03:59:35.938
LAURA: Well, we're going to do that, but first--

03:59:35.938 --> 03:59:38.529
LIAM: We have whole week in Rexxentrum.

03:59:38.529 --> 03:59:39.419
TALIESIN: We also have Scry.

03:59:39.419 --> 03:59:40.979
LIAM: Or anywhere we want to be.

03:59:40.979 --> 03:59:43.369
LAURA: Well, I do want to see my dad.

03:59:43.369 --> 03:59:46.839
I guess I don't have to. I can just send him messages.

03:59:46.839 --> 03:59:48.819
TALIESIN: I feel like talking to your dad anyway,

03:59:48.819 --> 03:59:51.229
just to see if we can get any information.

03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:53.235
LIAM: Yeah, handful of words is different than--

03:59:53.235 --> 03:59:54.580
LAURA: Plus, we can see Pumat!

03:59:54.580 --> 03:59:57.309
Don't you guys have things you want enchanted?

03:59:57.309 --> 03:59:58.209
TALIESIN: Always.

03:59:58.209 --> 04:00:01.089
TRAVIS: Oh, so many things.

04:00:01.089 --> 04:00:02.079
LIAM: Yeah, that ring of yours.

04:00:02.079 --> 04:00:04.421
You've got to get some magic into that.

04:00:06.794 --> 04:00:07.627
TRAVIS: (whispered) Yes.

04:00:09.309 --> 04:00:10.142
TALIESIN: I'd like to talk--

04:00:10.142 --> 04:00:12.083
I'd like to talk to him about that, actually.

04:00:12.083 --> 04:00:14.949
LIAM: Well, what if we holed up here in town for the night

04:00:14.949 --> 04:00:19.369
and in the morning, spend the day in the Zadash?

04:00:21.053 --> 04:00:22.589
LAURA: Okay.

04:00:22.589 --> 04:00:23.672
MARISHA: Okay.

04:00:24.749 --> 04:00:29.069
LAURA: You don't think Icky-thong's going to come after you?

04:00:29.069 --> 04:00:30.799
LIAM: No, I am his chosen.

04:00:30.799 --> 04:00:34.562
I will lead the Empire into a thousand years of glory

04:00:35.589 --> 04:00:36.780
or something.

04:00:37.729 --> 04:00:38.964
No, not tonight.

04:00:41.149 --> 04:00:44.859
Besides, I have this place we can stay tonight

04:00:44.859 --> 04:00:48.229
that I think you will love.

04:00:49.779 --> 04:00:51.049
TRAVIS: Oh, a new spot?

04:00:52.259 --> 04:00:54.969
MARISHA: Not the shitty tavern where we were at?
LAURA: Let's go!

04:00:54.969 --> 04:00:56.759
LIAM: Not the shitty tavern.

04:00:56.759 --> 04:00:58.549
MARISHA: All right.

04:00:58.549 --> 04:00:59.409
LIAM: Trust me?

04:00:59.409 --> 04:01:00.249
SAM: Trust?

04:01:00.249 --> 04:01:01.082
MARISHA: Totally, man.

04:01:01.082 --> 04:01:02.029
LIAM: All right.

04:01:02.029 --> 04:01:03.539
I slap down two gold.

04:01:03.539 --> 04:01:04.699
I have no idea what the bill was,

04:01:04.699 --> 04:01:05.669
but I'm sure that covers it.

04:01:05.669 --> 04:01:08.239
MATT: It definitely covers it. (laughs)

04:01:08.239 --> 04:01:11.341
LIAM: Head towards the door and I will--

04:01:12.535 --> 04:01:13.689
I'm not going to say this to any of them,

04:01:13.689 --> 04:01:18.169
but I will either go to the same basic-ass inn

04:01:18.169 --> 04:01:20.919
that we went to earlier or whatever's closest.

04:01:20.919 --> 04:01:21.985
MATT: Okay.

04:01:23.049 --> 04:01:25.309
To where you are now, you're a little bit further away.

04:01:25.309 --> 04:01:26.659
LIAM: Yeah.

04:01:26.659 --> 04:01:30.249
MATT: So you would be finding a new location

04:01:30.249 --> 04:01:31.739
and it's not hard to find.

04:01:31.739 --> 04:01:33.899
They're all pretty-- you know,

04:01:33.899 --> 04:01:36.161
you're on the cusp of squalor in this part of the city.

04:01:36.161 --> 04:01:38.417
LIAM: That's good.
MATT: Okay.

04:01:38.417 --> 04:01:40.149
So I will find a place

04:01:40.149 --> 04:01:42.199
that doesn't look like an instant death trap,

04:01:42.199 --> 04:01:44.469
but I'm not being that picky.

04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:45.509
Okay.

04:01:45.509 --> 04:01:47.569
I'll lead everybody in.

04:01:47.569 --> 04:01:48.402
LAURA: Wow.

04:01:48.402 --> 04:01:51.912
LIAM: And walk up to whoever is at the front desk.

04:01:51.912 --> 04:01:53.141
MATT: Okay, you're welcome to the front desk

04:01:53.141 --> 04:01:58.110
and you see a human woman in her fifties or so,

04:01:58.110 --> 04:01:59.585
and you see a human woman in her fifties or so,

04:01:59.585 --> 04:02:01.659
hair that's gone gray at the roots that goes

04:02:01.659 --> 04:02:02.844
to a bit of red at the end.

04:02:02.844 --> 04:02:04.459
It's probably been a long time since either it was dyed,

04:02:04.459 --> 04:02:06.552
or the hair color's just faded over time.

04:02:07.389 --> 04:02:12.389
Very, very leathery skin that's seen a harsh life.

04:02:12.399 --> 04:02:14.329
She's sitting there at the edge with

04:02:14.329 --> 04:02:18.424
a big tankard and looks part way into her cups

04:02:18.424 --> 04:02:20.075
and turns to you. "Eh?"

04:02:21.119 --> 04:02:22.429
LIAM: Good evening.

04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:27.429
I know it's somewhat late, but there are--

04:02:27.829 --> 04:02:32.129
I'm going to need nine rooms for the evening,

04:02:32.129 --> 04:02:35.939
and in one of them, I specifically need a closet

04:02:35.939 --> 04:02:38.189
or, like, a wardrobe?

04:02:38.189 --> 04:02:40.539
I have a lot of luggage.

04:02:40.539 --> 04:02:43.239
Do you have something that can accommodate that?

04:02:43.239 --> 04:02:44.369
MATT: "Probably?"

04:02:44.369 --> 04:02:45.639
LIAM: Okay.

04:02:45.639 --> 04:02:46.472
MATT: "Right, right.

04:02:46.472 --> 04:02:48.109
"Nine rooms.

04:02:48.109 --> 04:02:49.409
"Closet."

04:02:49.409 --> 04:02:51.234
LIAM: In one of them, at least, <i>ja</i>.

04:02:51.234 --> 04:02:53.276
MATT: "There an extra charge for the closet."

04:02:53.276 --> 04:02:54.901
SAM: (giggles)

04:02:54.901 --> 04:02:57.619
LIAM: I think I can handle that--
MATT: "Closet fee."

04:02:57.619 --> 04:02:59.289
LIAM: I will pay your closet fee.

04:02:59.289 --> 04:03:00.972
MATT: "Right, right.

04:03:03.609 --> 04:03:06.289
"That'll run you two gold pieces,

04:03:06.289 --> 04:03:08.829
"including the closet fee."

04:03:08.829 --> 04:03:10.819
LIAM: Okay, I hand her--
MATT: "Final deal."

04:03:10.819 --> 04:03:12.452
LIAM: I give her three gold.

04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:15.302
MATT: "Right."

04:03:15.302 --> 04:03:17.039
LIAM: Which way?

04:03:17.039 --> 04:03:18.509
MATT: "This way.

04:03:18.509 --> 04:03:21.917
(yelling) "Sebastian, bring up the closet!"

04:03:21.917 --> 04:03:23.983
SAM: Bring up the closet?
MARISHA: The closet?

04:03:23.983 --> 04:03:25.391
MATT: There's a voice that acts like,

04:03:25.391 --> 04:03:27.366
(high-pitched) "What do you mean? [inaudible]"

04:03:27.366 --> 04:03:31.291
(as innkeeper) "Empty out the meats and
carry it upstairs for room 102!"

04:03:31.291 --> 04:03:33.481
SAM: (laughs)

04:03:33.481 --> 04:03:35.081
MATT: See this older man come out,

04:03:35.081 --> 04:03:37.369
this dirty face.

04:03:37.369 --> 04:03:38.717
Has been in the kitchen sweating.

04:03:38.717 --> 04:03:42.246
And he's like, "What do you mean empty out the meat closet?"

04:03:42.246 --> 04:03:44.257
Tosses a gold to him. "I said..."

04:03:44.257 --> 04:03:46.050
He goes, "Oh, all right."

04:03:47.109 --> 04:03:49.819
You hear a door open,

04:03:49.819 --> 04:03:50.949
and as you guys make your way out there,

04:03:50.949 --> 04:03:54.979
these rooms are... functional.

04:03:54.979 --> 04:03:58.339
LAURA: This is really nice, Caleb.
MATT: Each has a bed.

04:03:58.339 --> 04:03:59.917
LAURA: Thank you for bringing us here.

04:03:59.917 --> 04:04:01.584
SAM: Wonderful.

04:04:01.584 --> 04:04:04.026
LIAM: I tip Sebastian. Was that his name?

04:04:04.026 --> 04:04:06.149
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: I tip Sebastian a silver.

04:04:06.149 --> 04:04:06.982
MATT: Okay.

04:04:06.982 --> 04:04:09.699
LIAM: And you know, before everyone heads to bed,

04:04:09.699 --> 04:04:13.199
just come in with me for a moment.

04:04:13.199 --> 04:04:15.761
I want to discuss one last thing.
MATT: (as Sebastian) "(grunts)"

04:04:15.761 --> 04:04:16.649
LAURA: You need some help?

04:04:16.649 --> 04:04:17.979
I'll go up and--
MATT: "I got it!

04:04:17.979 --> 04:04:19.645
"I got it."
LAURA: I'm going to help him.

04:04:19.645 --> 04:04:21.663
MATT: "No! Oh, fine."

04:04:21.663 --> 04:04:24.809
He takes it and you carry in this--

04:04:24.809 --> 04:04:26.189
LIAM: Is he carrying a whisper booth?

04:04:26.189 --> 04:04:27.239
What does he got?

04:04:27.239 --> 04:04:28.969
MATT: No, no, it's a--

04:04:28.969 --> 04:04:31.559
it's a wardrobe that had been fashioned

04:04:31.559 --> 04:04:34.769
as a meat storage rack in the kitchen downstairs,

04:04:34.769 --> 04:04:35.602
that has been emptied out.

04:04:35.602 --> 04:04:38.329
So it smells strongly of cured meats

04:04:38.329 --> 04:04:41.149
of various degrees of freshness,

04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:43.699
but it is a functional, empty wardrobe.

04:04:43.699 --> 04:04:44.532
LIAM: Amazing.

04:04:44.532 --> 04:04:46.669
SAM: I'm picturing, like, an IKEA Malm.

04:04:46.669 --> 04:04:49.102
(laughter)

04:04:49.102 --> 04:04:49.935
MATT: More or less.

04:04:49.935 --> 04:04:52.176
SAM: With just a bunch of blood on the bottom.

04:04:52.176 --> 04:04:55.899
MATT: Oh yeah, more or less. It is a stained interior.

04:04:55.899 --> 04:04:57.337
But it is placed in the room.

04:04:57.337 --> 04:04:59.919
"Thank you, kindly. Sleep well."

04:04:59.919 --> 04:05:01.819
And he heads off and shuffled his way back down the stairs.

04:05:01.819 --> 04:05:05.755
LIAM: Okay, I get the last of the
Nein in and I shut the door.

04:05:07.139 --> 04:05:09.049
Give me one second.

04:05:09.049 --> 04:05:13.419
And I open the door of this wardrobe closet, which smells,

04:05:13.419 --> 04:05:17.609
and I pull out the wand that Calianna gave me.

04:05:17.609 --> 04:05:20.329
And I look at the bottom of the wardrobe

04:05:20.329 --> 04:05:21.529
and there's a little hole,

04:05:21.529 --> 04:05:23.305
a little imperfection in the wood, a knot,

04:05:23.305 --> 04:05:25.459
and I stick the wand into that hole

04:05:25.459 --> 04:05:27.311
so it's standing up

04:05:27.311 --> 04:05:30.459
and then I pull out several pieces of stained glass

04:05:30.459 --> 04:05:32.599
and arrange them just so,

04:05:32.599 --> 04:05:37.089
and I take out a small piece of slate and put-- excuse me,

04:05:37.089 --> 04:05:38.939
granite, and put that on the ground,

04:05:38.939 --> 04:05:42.439
and that little wooden cat that I had fabricated,

04:05:42.439 --> 04:05:44.909
I put on top of the granite

04:05:44.909 --> 04:05:49.109
and I then began to use chalk to draw around those.

04:05:49.109 --> 04:05:53.219
And I draw a solid line behind that wand

04:05:53.219 --> 04:05:55.289
and start to utter words

04:05:55.289 --> 04:05:57.779
and a moment of this

04:05:57.779 --> 04:06:01.187
and that chalk line begins to glow a thin golden amber color

04:06:01.187 --> 04:06:04.745
and that chalk line begins to glow a thin golden amber color

04:06:04.745 --> 04:06:09.676
and a rectangle of amber shimmers up from that line.

04:06:09.676 --> 04:06:11.659
and a rectangle of amber shimmers up from that line.

04:06:11.659 --> 04:06:15.019
And the amber begins to waver

04:06:15.019 --> 04:06:19.169
and past it, you see just the barest glimpse

04:06:19.169 --> 04:06:24.169
of windows of stained glass stretching up into the air.

04:06:24.449 --> 04:06:27.979
And I say: Welcome home.

04:06:27.979 --> 04:06:29.029
And I walk in.

04:06:29.029 --> 04:06:29.981
SAM: Ooh.

04:06:31.660 --> 04:06:32.609
TALIESIN: I'm walking in.

04:06:32.609 --> 04:06:35.679
LAURA: Same, same, same, same.
SAM: Let's go. Let's go.

04:06:35.679 --> 04:06:39.929
MATT: As you all step into the wardrobe to follow Caleb

04:06:39.929 --> 04:06:43.379
into whatever strange realm he seems

04:06:43.379 --> 04:06:45.569
to have called you into,

04:06:45.569 --> 04:06:47.382
we're going to go ahead and call the episode for the night.

04:06:47.382 --> 04:06:48.582
(exclamations)

04:06:48.582 --> 04:06:49.944
TRAVIS: What did you do?

04:06:49.944 --> 04:06:50.777
ASHLEY: What is this?

04:06:50.777 --> 04:06:51.610
SAM: He kills us all.

04:06:51.610 --> 04:06:53.327
TRAVIS: Cat scratch closet.

04:06:53.327 --> 04:06:55.577
(laughter)

04:06:56.779 --> 04:06:58.996
MATT: Yeah, we'll pick up there next episode.

04:07:01.610 --> 04:07:04.269
You get to think on your description.

04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:06.519
I'm sure you're thinking on it for a while, but anyway.

04:07:06.519 --> 04:07:08.239
Thank you all so much for joining us.

04:07:08.239 --> 04:07:09.969
Hope you enjoyed it as much we did.

04:07:09.969 --> 04:07:13.507
We love you very much and is it Thursday yet?

04:07:13.507 --> 04:07:14.404
Good night.
LIAM: No!
